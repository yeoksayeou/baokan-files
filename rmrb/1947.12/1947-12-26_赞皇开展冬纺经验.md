　　Zanhua Develops Winter Spinning Experience
    [Report from our Zanhua correspondent] Since the launch of the winter spinning campaign this year, some experiences have been created and are introduced as follows: First, ideological mobilization. From the beginning of the spinning campaign to the present, some women still have the following ideas: "Although this year is a famine year, it is okay to have some rapeseed and radish, and a little grain," "Yuanshi has been conquered, and action is more convenient. It doesn't matter when you do it." There are also thoughts of postponing due to children being tired, the weather being cold, and busy chores. To solve these problems, we must start from the perspective of the masses earning money, and calculate accounts with concrete examples. For example, Pei Lanqun of Dongwang'e and her mother-in-law, along with two girls (one thirteen and one fifteen years old), started spinning at night with three spinning wheels. In forty-five days, they spun a total of ninety-six jin of yarn, earning 59,000 yuan. After the whole family calculated the accounts, their enthusiasm for spinning was very high. Second, to organize, it is necessary to establish poor and hired peasant backbones. When the masses are inspired to spin through "calculating accounts" and "comparisons," we must seize the opportunity to organize and turn the demands of the masses into action. After using accounting to open up the minds of the masses in Beiyan Village, the women's director immediately grasped the organization with great enthusiasm, and built thirteen pits in four days, which can accommodate one hundred and three spinning wheels. When organizing, we must pay attention to establishing a backbone of poor laborers and solve their specific difficulties. For example, when the cadre of Qujiang mobilized the poor woman Guo Bingniang, he asked, "What difficulties do you have?" She was very hesitant and said, "No difficulties." After a patient investigation, it was discovered that she was suffering from a serious disaster and was constantly crying, wanting to spin but having no capital. She was immediately lent seven jin of cotton. She also planned to sell the calf to exchange for a donkey and asked her son to engage in transportation. After solving these specific difficulties, she joined the spinning group and spun until midnight every day. Third, fair and equal prices can consolidate the organization. In the beginning, it was generally said, "Since we are helping each other, what does it matter if we suffer a little loss or gain a little advantage?" However, after a long time, those with stronger labor power will inevitably feel that they are suffering losses, and they will think, "How can I be hurt in the long run?" As a result, they become negative, have opinions, and the organization collapses. Some even say, "I will never cooperate with ×× again in my life." Therefore, whether it can be consolidated for a long time depends on whether fair and equal prices can be achieved. For example, in the Bai Lu Liu Chenchen group, there were opinions due to the unequal labor and working hours of two people carrying children. Therefore, it was discussed and stipulated that distribution should be based on work, and dividends should be distributed regularly. Before the distribution, those who spun flowers spun five liang per day, and those who wove cloth wove half a jin per day. After the distribution was determined, those who spun flowers spun eight liang per day, and those who wove cloth wove two jin per day. In addition, some villages also have organizations that exchange labor for weaving cloth and taking care of children, cooking and other chores. Small cooperatives collectively buy flowers and sell cloth, with simple equal pricing, which saves labor. This method can also be studied and adopted.

　　赞皇开展冬纺经验
    【本报赞皇讯】今冬纺织运动开展以来，创造了一些经验介绍如下：一、思想动员。在纺织运动开始以至现在，还有部分妇女存在如下思想：“今年虽说荒年，可是有油菜萝卜，有点粮食就行，”“元氏打啦，行动更方便了，啥时候干也沾。”还有小孩累、天冷、杂活忙等往后推的思想。在解决这些思想上，先从群众赚钱上出发，拿具体例子算帐。如东王俄裴兰群与他婆子两个女孩（一个十三一个十五），三辆纺车开始夜纺，四十五天内，共纺线九十六斤，赚洋五万九千元，全家算帐后，纺织情绪很高。二、组织起来，必须树立贫雇骨干。在群众经“算算帐”“对比”启发纺织情绪之时，就要抓紧进行组织，把群众的要求变成行动。北延庄在用算帐打通群众思想后，妇女主任当会即抓紧组织，一股热情，四天打窨子十三个，可容纺车一百零三辆。组织时必须注意树立雇贫骨干，解决其具体困难。如曲江干部发动贫妇郭兵娘时问：“你有啥困难？”他顾虑很大说：“没困难。”经过耐心的调查，才发现他灾荒严重的没办法，整天啼哭，想纺织没本钱。马上借给他七斤棉花，他又打算卖了小牛换个驴，叫他儿子搞运输，解决了这些具体困难后，他参加了纺织组，每天纺到半夜。三、公平等价才能巩固组织。起初一般的是说：“既然互助，吃点亏沾点光算啥。”但时间长了劳力较强的必然感到吃亏，心里说：“咱天长日久被伤怎行？”于是消极闹意见走到垮台。甚至说“我一辈子再不合××互助了。”所以是否能够长期巩固，决定于能否公平等价。如白鹿刘辰辰组，因有两个抱小孩的，因劳力与干活时间不等发生意见，于是讨论规定按活计分，定期分红，定分前纺花的每天纺五两，织布的每天织半斤，定分后每天纺八两，织布的每天织二斤。此外某些村也有实行织布与看小孩、作饭等杂活变工组织，小型社集体买花卖布，有简单的等价，并节省了劳力，这办法也可研究采用。　　　　（赞皇联合办公室李玉保）
