Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 22nd: According to news from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas: Recently, in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas around Luoyang, western Henan, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been frantically "seizing," "transporting," and "collecting" military grain, which has stimulated a sharp rise in grain prices. In the vicinity of Luoyang, the price of wheat more than doubled in the week from the 5th to the 12th of this month, rising from over 30,000 yuan per market dou to over 80,000 yuan. Some counties even exceeded this number. It is generally predicted that due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' continued "seizure" of grain, the price may break the 100,000 yuan mark before the end of the year. Some farmers who cannot even afford to eat sweet potatoes are forced to sell their land to pay for grain. Under the dual attack of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' criminal grain seizure and soaring grain prices, the vast number of people in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas of western Henan are facing a serious threat of widespread famine. People already feel that the great famine in central Henan five years ago will be repeated in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas of western Henan today.

Furthermore, after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits issued 100,000 yuan banknotes on the 10th of this month, prices in various places have fluctuated. In Beijing, on the 10th alone, flour rose to 560,000 yuan per bag, cotton yarn rose by 3 to 4 million yuan per piece, and cloth also rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per bolt. In Tianjin, "Battleship" brand flour reached over 700,000 yuan per bag on the 13th. Prices in Taiyuan have risen even more rapidly. On the 10th, flour rose to 1.47 million yuan per bag, an increase of 320,000 yuan in one day compared to the previous day. Rice cost 28,000 yuan per market catty, more than double the price of rice in Shanghai, and sorghum flour cost 9,000 yuan per market catty. In Shenyang, the price of flour rose to 1.4 million yuan per bag on the 21st of this month, double the price in Beijing, and some commodities were more than three times higher. In other places such as Hankou and Qingdao, prices also rose sharply after the issuance of banknotes. People sigh with the words "We can't afford to live."

　　蒋区人民都叹“活不起”了
  　一斤白面要两三万元
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据蒋区报纸消息：豫西洛阳一带蒋占区，近因蒋匪在该地区疯狂“抢征”、“抢运”、“抢缴”内战军粮，刺激粮价飞跃上涨。洛阳附近麦价，于本月五日至十二日一周内上涨一倍多，由每市斗三万余元涨至八万余元，有些县还不止此数。一般预测因蒋匪继续“抢征”粮食，年前可能突破十万元大关。有些连红薯都吃不上的农民，被迫纷纷卖地缴粮。豫西蒋占区广大人民在蒋匪罪恶抢粮及粮价飞涨之夹击下，已面临普遍饥馑之严重威胁，人民已预感五年前豫中之大灾荒将重演于今日之豫西蒋区。
    又蒋匪本月十日发行十万元大钞后，各地物价均起波动，北平于十日一天内，面粉每袋涨至五十六万元，棉纱每件上涨三、四百万元，布匹每匹也涨高六、七万元。天津兵船牌面粉于十三日每袋曾高达七十万元以上。太原物价更迅速飞涨，十日面粉每袋涨至一百四十七万元，一日之内较前竟上涨三十二万元，大米每市斤二万八千元，高出上海米价一倍以上，高粱面每市斤也要九千元。沈阳面粉价格本月二十一日每袋已涨至一百四十万元蒋币，高出北平面价一倍，若干商品则高出三倍以上。其他汉口、青岛等地物价于发钞后也同样剧烈上涨，人民均以“活不起”三字为叹。
