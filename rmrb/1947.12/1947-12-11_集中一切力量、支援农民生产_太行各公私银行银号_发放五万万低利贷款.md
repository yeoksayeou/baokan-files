    Concentrate All Efforts to Support Farmers' Production
    Taihang Public and Private Banks and Native Banks
    Issue 550 Million Low-Interest Loans
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 9th] Public and private banks and native banks in various regions are actively concentrating all their efforts to issue 550.5 million yuan in low-interest loans to support farmers and urban residents in various counties and cities in their winter production to overcome the famine. The Taihang Third Branch of the Jinnan Bank recently convened a meeting of managers from various banks and native banks in Changzhi City to study how to solve the financial difficulties of the masses in production and meet the demands of the masses. After research and discussion, the meeting finally decided that in addition to allocating the original 250 million yuan of production loan funds to county branches to directly support the production of poor and hired peasants, another 68 million yuan would be drawn from the deposits of various banks and native banks to support the production of the masses. This includes 30 million yuan from the Changzhi City Branch of the Jinnan Bank, 30 million yuan from the Changzhi Branch of the Ruihua Bank, and 8 million yuan from the Changzhi Branch of the Tai Gu Yuxing Native Bank. These loans are calculated at an interest rate of 0.21% per month (monthly interest) on current deposits, with a term of three months, and are directly managed and issued by the county branches. The focus is on assisting areas severely affected by famine and solving the capital difficulties of poor and hired peasants in production. Loans are provided to production mutual aid groups with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, and used in an organized manner. The funds have now been allocated to the county branches, which are organizing the issuance. The Xingtai City Branch of the Jinnan Bank and other branches have also recently issued a large number of low-interest loans to help urban residents in production. The interest rate on Jinnan Bank loans is 4.5%, while other native banks charge 5.1%, with special consideration for military dependents, whose loan interest rate is uniformly reduced by 0.5%. From late October to now, the city branch has already lent out 100 million yuan. In order to organize a greater force and fully solve the funding difficulties of urban residents in production, various native banks in the city have also increased loan issuance by 87.5 million yuan based on their own operational capacity, including 47.5 million yuan from Ruihua Bank, 30 million yuan from Yuxing Native Bank, and 10 million yuan from Yuhua Native Bank. These loans have been democratically discussed by mass cadres in various streets, and now poor urban residents have all received loans. Several poorer streets (including nine rural villages under the city's jurisdiction) have exceeded the prescribed amount. The First Branch of the Jinnan Bank and the Taihang First Special Commissioner's Office have also increased low-interest loans by 50 million yuan, specifically to support the production of poor and hired peasants to overcome the famine.
