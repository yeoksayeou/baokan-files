　　Sima Village Cooperative Deceives Superiors and Subordinates
  　Actually Uses Loans to Replace Village Funds
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] In Sima Village, Second District, it was discovered during the trans-lending and loan inspection that the 60,000 yuan textile loan from this spring was not lent to the women by the cooperative after it was borrowed; in July, the bank issued production loans again, and the cooperative, under the pretext of lending credit loans, borrowed another 200,000 yuan, none of which was lent to the masses, and was still used by the cooperative. In September, the village organized village finances and accounted for more than 1.2 million yuan, which was taken to the city to purchase a city house, with a purchase price of 1.48 million yuan. The village finances were not enough, so they misappropriated the two loans of 260,000 yuan to replace the village finances. When asked, the villagers had no idea that there were any loans. The village is now being cleaned up.

　　司马村合作社欺上瞒下
  　竟把贷款顶村款
    【本报长治讯】二区司马村，在转贷与查贷中发现，今春纺织贷款六万元，合作社贷回未曾贷给妇女；七月间银行又发放生产贷款，该合作社借口贷信用贷款，又贷回廿万元分文也未贷给群众，仍由合作社使用。到九月，村上整理村财政，整出一百二十余万元，拿到城里购买市房一所，买价一百四十八万元，村财政不够用，就又把二宗贷款二十六万元挪用顶了村财政，问村中群众，群众完全不知道有贷款。现该村正在进行清理。
