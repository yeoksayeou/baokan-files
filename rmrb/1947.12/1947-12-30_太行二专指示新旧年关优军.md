　　Taihang Second District Instructions on Preferential Treatment for Military Families During the New Year Period
    [Report from our Taihang office on the 28th] The Taihang Second District Office issued instructions to all counties on the 22nd of this month to launch a campaign of preferential treatment for military families and revolutionary martyrs’ families during the New Year period. 1. Designate January 1st to 7th as Military Support Week. During this week, in addition to paying New Year visits and offering condolences to military families and revolutionary martyrs' families, the focus should be on conducting thorough checks and providing concrete assistance to solve the difficulties faced by hired poor military families and revolutionary martyrs' families in winter production. Discussions should also be held on how to further organize hired poor military families and revolutionary martyrs' families to carry out winter production from now until the Lunar New Year, and a plan should be drawn up. 2. Lunar New Year: Designate the period from the first day of the Lunar New Year to the end of the month as Military Support Month (instructions on military support work will be issued separately later). In addition to paying New Year visits and exchanging gifts, ideological and political education should be conducted for the masses to encourage conscious military support and preferential treatment for military families. Mass inspections and reviews of substitute farming, firewood and water provision, and spiritual support should be carried out. The advantages and disadvantages of the preferential treatment for military families should be summarized, and symposiums of military families, revolutionary martyrs' families, and disabled veterans should be convened to solicit their opinions. In the summary, good practices should be commended, models should be elected, and plans for preferential treatment in the coming spring should be formulated. The masses should be mobilized to review whether the abolition of veterans' organizations has led to different views, resulting in disrespect for veterans and other adverse phenomena. Mutual reviews and self-criticism should be conducted, using the "untie the knot" method to bridge the gap in thinking between the two sides, so that both sides can understand each other.

　　太行二专指示新旧年关优军
    【本报太行廿八日电】太行二专署于本月廿二日，指示各县在新旧年关展开优待军烈属运动。一、确定一月一日至七日为优军周。在这一周内，除给军烈属拜年慰问外，重点应确实检查，具体的帮助与解决雇贫军烈属冬季生产中的困难问题。并讨论从现在到旧历年关，怎样进一步的组织雇贫军烈属进行冬季生产，订出计划。二、旧历年关：确定旧历正月初一日到月终为拥优月（拥军工作以后另行指示），除拜年互送礼物外，应进行对群众的思想教育和政治教育，使群众走向自觉的拥军优军，开展代耕、柴水、精神优待的群众检查检讨，总结优军的优缺点，召开军烈属荣军座谈会，征求他们的意见，在总结中表扬好的，选举模范，并订出明春优待计划。发动群众检讨在取消荣军组织后是否产生另外看法，以致对荣军不尊重等不良现象，应当互相检讨进行自我批评，用“解圪塔”方法，打通双方思想，使双方互相谅解。
