Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd—According to various reports, due to the continuous military failures of the Chiang bandit troops in North China, Chiang Kai-shek hastily stayed in Peiping for three days and flew back to Nanjing on the 29th. The only way Chiang the thief is dealing with his "already critical military situation in North China" is to "reorganize" his military structure in North China and replace the cadres he does not trust. Chiang the thief's Peiping Pacification Headquarters announced on the 1st that the Zhangjiakou and Baoding Pacification Headquarters were abolished, and a "North China Bandit Suppression General Headquarters" was established, with the former Director of the Zhangjiakou Pacification Headquarters, Fu Zuoyi, as the commander-in-chief, and the former Director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, Sun Lianzhong, dismissed. According to a United Press dispatch from Peiping: "Since half a dozen or more important military and political personnel under Sun Lianzhong were arrested in September, rumors that Sun would be dismissed have been rife. Observers here believe that Chiang Kai-shek's retention of Sun's position as Chairman of Hebei Province is merely for the sake of saving face." In addition, the establishment of the so-called "North China Bandit Suppression General Headquarters" outside the Chiang the thief's Peiping Pacification Headquarters, headed by the Gui系 general Li Zongren, has resulted in the former becoming an empty organ. The above-mentioned measures of Chiang the thief reflect the dead end and helplessness of the Chiang bandit troops in North China, and he is using the dismissal and punishment of his generals to cover up his inability to command. Therefore, under the greater hammer blows of the People's Liberation Army, Fu Zuoyi's unlucky days will soon arrive.

　　蒋贼在华北日暮途穷撤换家奴为自己遮羞
    【新华社陕北二日电】据各方报导：由于华北蒋匪军事不断失败，蒋介石匆匆在北平住了三天，已于二十九日飞返南京。蒋贼对其“已形危急的华北军事局势”的唯一应付方法是“改组”其华北的军事机构，撤换其所不信任的干部。蒋贼北平行辕已于一日宣布将张家口及保定两个绥靖公署撤销，并成立一“华北剿匪总司令部”，以原任张家口绥署主任傅作义为总司令，原任保定绥署主任之孙连仲则已被免职。据合众社北平电称：“自九月间孙连仲手下半打以上的重要军政人员被捕以来，孙氏即将被撤职的谣传就甚嚣尘上。此间观察家认为蒋介石保留孙氏河北省主席一职仅仅是留面子。”此外，在以桂系将领李宗仁为主任的蒋贼北平行辕之外成立所谓“华北剿匪总司令部，”结果前者就变成了空头机关。蒋贼的上述措施，反映出蒋匪在华北的穷途末路，捉襟见肘，并以撤换，惩办他的将领为自己指挥无能遮羞，因此在人民解放军更大的锤击之下，傅作义倒霉的日子不久也就要到来。
