Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st: The Political and Military Organs of the East China Field Army have issued an order to all units, requiring them to earnestly implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention during the counter-offensive, unite with and mobilize the masses in the newly liberated areas, and have specifically stipulated: (1) It is imperative to enhance the class sympathy of all commanders and fighters for the working people. The bloody atrocities committed by the Chiang bandits against the masses in the garrison areas must be widely publicized within the troops, calling on all commanders and fighters to vow to avenge the people; at the same time, publicize the victory of the national counter-offensive to the masses, and enhance the masses' confidence in the victory of the struggle. (2) When quartering in houses, the principle of military-civilian consideration should be adopted. In winter, hot kang (heated brick beds) should be left for the common people; when it is necessary to live on hot kang, one kang should be left for every two; if there is only one kang, one household should be selected out of three to live in. (3) When eating grain, try to bring your own as much as possible. When it is unavoidable to borrow from the village, the lives of the masses must also be taken care of, and the consent of the masses must be obtained. (4) Carry out mass work, conduct investigations of local conditions and customs, and report the obtained materials level by level, conduct propaganda for landlords, and help the government restore or establish mass organizations and local political power. (5) Arrest personnel of the Chiang bandit regime, landlords who attempt to restore their power, "Returning Home Corps" members, enemy agents, etc., and hand them over to the local authorities for handling. (6) Help the masses with labor, and universally implement the "Three No-Go" movement: no leaving until the water vat is full, no leaving until the ground is swept, and no leaving until the things are returned.
    Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 1st: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a commendation to the machine gun company of the "Laiyang" Brigade for strictly observing mass discipline in the Battle of Dangshan. Before the battle, the company conducted thorough land reform education and vowed at the accusation meeting to "Carry out the revolution to the end and capture the great enemy Chiang Kai-shek alive." After the order to launch a general attack on Dangshan was issued, everyone vowed "to realize our determination of accusation on the battlefield!" "Bring our good discipline to the newly liberated areas!" When the company entered the four gates of Dangshan on the ninth day, the first squad was stationed in a winery, and the whole squad did not drink a single drop. On the table in the house where the fifth squad was stationed, there were five packs of American cigarettes and a pile of cooked peanuts, but no one touched them at all. When liberation fighter Wang Ruiwu first arrived at the Liberation Army, he said, "This team helps the common people with work before dawn, and I'm not used to it." After this land reform education, he quickly changed. When he entered Dongguan in Dangshan, he saw that the common people's peanuts had fallen on the ground, and he immediately collected them into the basket on their behalf, without moving a single one. After opening the city, the company transported five wounded soldiers to the suburbs and sent the five door panels back to their homes. After the war, a general inspection revealed that no one in the entire company violated mass discipline, and everyone was able to "not forget their roots on the battlefield."
    Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, 30th: The various units on the Ji-Cha-Re-Liao front are enthusiastically studying the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention newly promulgated by the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army and strengthening mass work in the battlefield. After a week of study, the soldiers of a certain unit put forward "Five Wants": Want to sweep the floor, want to carry water, want to do propaganda, want to do investigations, want to cherish grain and grass. "Five Don'ts": Don't ask the masses to serve you, don't urinate and defecate indiscriminately, don't destroy furniture, don't touch the belongings of escaped households, don't accept gifts from the masses. Discipline inspection teams composed of political workers at all levels were also established to ensure that the above minimum requirements are met. Another unit proposed "Three No-Goes": that is, no leaving until the discipline inspection is thorough, no leaving without holding a mass meeting when time permits, and no leaving without cleaning up. Another unit launched a "Three No-Dumb" movement: do not be a dumb person when entering and leaving to propagandize to the masses, do not fight a dumb battle when shouting to win over the bandit army to surrender, and do not walk a dumb road when doing political propaganda along the way. All units also stipulated that those who meet these conditions can be credited, and those who violate these conditions will be subject to criticism and punishment. A certain unit has begun to help the masses chop firewood, line cattle and sheep pens, peel corn, etc. Under this influence, the relationship between the army and the people has been greatly improved, and the masses in the newly liberated areas have automatically handed over to our army the long and short guns and ammunition that they had been forced to sell to them by the Chiang bandit army in the past. A certain company of a certain unit received sixty-four long and short guns in three months.

　　华东野战军训令全体指战员
    严守纪律发动新区群众
    提高对劳苦群众的阶级感情
    【新华社华东前线一日电】华东野战军司政机关顷训令各部在反攻进军中切实执行三大纪律、八项注意，团结与发动新区群众，特规定：（一）必须提高全体指战员对劳苦群众的阶级同情心，要把驻地群众受蒋匪蹂躏的血腥事迹在部队里广泛宣传，号召全体指战员立志为人民复仇；同时向群众宣传全国反攻胜利，提高群众斗争胜利信心。（二）驻房子，要采取军民兼顾的原则。冬天要把热炕留给老百姓；必须住热炕时，也应两炕留一炕；只有一炕者，则在三户中选一户住。（三）吃粮，要尽量自己带，不得已向驻村征借时，也必须照顾群众生活，需要征得群众同意。（四）开展群众工作，做民情调查，将所得材料按级汇报，进行房东宣传，帮助政府恢复或建立群众组织与地方政权。（五）逮捕蒋匪政权人员、复辟地主、“还乡团”、敌特等，交地方法办。（六）帮助群众劳动，普遍实行“三不走”运动：水缸不满不走，地不扫不走，东西不还不走。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线一日电】解放军某部顷传令嘉奖在砀山之战中严格遵守群众纪律的“莱阳”大队机枪连。该连曾于战前深入进行土改教育，在控诉大会上，并立誓“革命革到底，活捉大仇人蒋介石。”总攻砀山命令下达后，大家即宣誓“在战场上实现我们控诉的决心！”“把我良好的纪律带到新解放区去！”九日攻入砀山四关时，该连一班驻于一家酒坊里，全班未喝一滴。五班驻家桌上放着五包美国香烟、一堆熟花生，没有一个人动它一点。解放战士王瑞五初到解放军时，曾说：“这个队伍天不亮就帮老百姓干活，我有点过不惯。”经过此次土改教育后，迅速转变。他于进入砀山东关时，见老百姓的花生落在地上，即代为检入筐中，不动一粒。打开城厢后，该连将五个伤员运至近郊后，把五块门板按家送回。战后普遍检查，全连无一人破坏群众纪律，都能做到“在战场上不忘本”。
    【新华社冀察热辽三十日电】冀察热辽前线各部队热烈学习人民解放军总部新颁发的三大纪律八项注意并加强战地群众工作。某部经过一周学习后，战士们提出“五要”；要扫地，要担水，要宣传，要调查，要爱护粮草。“五不要”；不要群众侍候，不要乱解手，不要破坏家具，不要动逃亡户的东西，不要群众送礼。并由各级政工人员组成纪律检查组，保证做到以上起码的规定。另部提出“三不走”；即纪律检查不彻底不走，时间允许而不开群众会不走，不打扫清洁不走。另部则开展“三不哑吧”运动；进出向群众宣传不做哑吧人，喊话争取匪军投降不打哑吧仗，沿路做政治宣传不走哑吧路。各部队并规定做到这些条件的就可立功，违反这些条件的就要受批评处分。某部已开始帮助群众打柴，垫牛羊圈，剥包谷等。在此影响下，军民关系大大改善，新解放区群众纷纷把过去受蒋匪军私自强迫卖给他们的长短枪弹药，都自动交给我军，某部某连在三个月中就收到长短枪六十四枝。
