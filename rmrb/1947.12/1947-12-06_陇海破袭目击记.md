　　Eyewitness Account of the Destruction of the Longhai Railway
　　(I) At the end of October, all counties began preparing tools for destroying the road. On November 6th, the Third District of Kaocheng received the task of manufacturing 40 road-breaking tools. Cadres then went to find ironworkers, teachers, bought charcoal, and mobilized pig iron in various villages. When the masses heard about destroying the Longhai Railway, they were very enthusiastic and sent the iron to the district overnight. The blacksmith teachers were even more energetic, working day and night. In less than seven days, 40 tools were made. Han Sixun from Xiejiji is 66 years old this year. He was so busy that he didn't even bother to eat. When someone asked him to repair his tools, he said, "I haven't finished the work I should be doing yet, and I can't repair anyone's tools." In five days, he made eight pairs of pliers, ten crowbars, and four axes, each weighing seven or eight pounds. Someone asked him, "Why are you so energetic?" He said, "It's a blessing for all of us to have the railway destroyed. If we open the Longhai Railway, I'll be even more energetic."
　　(II) When organizing the road-breaking teams, Zhanglou Village in the First District of Fucheng sent 36 civilian workers, but all the young people in the village were vying to go, requesting the district to increase the number of people. They said, "Only by breaking the Longhai Railway can we have peace here." After repeated explanations from the cadres, some people were left behind to do supply work. Comrades Han Chaoyang and Hua Zuoping led 8,500 civilian workers from Shan County and advanced towards the Longhai Railway on the night of November 8th. This team carried all kinds of weapons—shovels, grappling hooks, large and small saws, oil hammers, levers, ropes, pliers, etc. In the midst of intense artillery fire, they quickened their pace, and people shouted loudly, "Cut off the legs of the Chiang bandits!" The Longhai Railway, this artery of the Chiang bandits, lay like an incompetent snake in front of us.
　　(III) On November 10th, the large-scale destruction by the Fifth Military Subdistrict had been going on for two nights. The enemy shrank back in Minquan and Liuhe, afraid to move, only firing artillery and launching flares to embolden and calm themselves. But who cared about them? As soon as it got dark, our demolition teams came out of the thousands of villages along the old Yellow River and rushed to the railway. The fire from the water towers was the brightest. In the light of the fire, the civilian workers excitedly tore down the blockhouses. In a moment, several blockhouses and station buildings were burning. The eastern demolition team was chopping down telephone poles, pulling down wires, and tearing up rails, as lively as a siege. When I ran up to a civilian worker from Xietan, Kaocheng, and asked him why he was so energetic, he replied, "If it weren't for this business—the railway—we would have had peace long ago. Ma Fengle (Chiang bandit) relies on this, and we haven't had a peaceful night's sleep." At three o'clock, everyone began to burn the sleepers. Piles of flames connected together, reddening the sky and destroying the legs of the Chiang bandits.
　　(IV) On November 15th, from dawn to dusk, on the avenue from the Longhai Railway to Qingji, the victorious road-breaking civilian workers returned like an iron torrent, without interruption all day long. The people along the Longhai Railway have been liberated. The liberated peasants revealed an indescribable joy. Everyone carried spoils of war—broken rails, large iron nails, electric wires... As they walked, they said, "This time, we've dug up Chiang Kai-shek's roots!" "We've broken Chiang Kai-shek's legs!" "We've drawn Chiang Kai-shek's sinews!" "We'll use the iron nails we brought to make iron hoes and grappling hooks!" "We'll use the iron nails we brought as rake teeth." An over-forty-year-old civilian worker from Wanglou walked with full vigor. I asked him, "Old man, take a rest, aren't you tired?" "Not tired, not tired, I couldn't be happier. We're eating wheat—obtained from the enemy—and we have these spoils of war. That grandson isn't coming easily." (Jilu Yu Branch of the News Agency)

　　陇海破袭目击记
    （一）十月底，各县都开始准备破路工具。十一月六日，考城三区接到负责制造破路工具四十件的任务后，干部便分头去找铁工、找老师、买炭、到各村去动员生铁。群众一听说破陇海路，情绪很高，连夜把铁送到区里。铁匠老师劲头更大，日夜不停的在打，不到七天的工夫，四十件工具造好了。谢集韩思训，今年六十六岁了，他忙的连饭都不顾吃，有人找他修理家伙，他说：“我应作的工作还没完成，谁的家伙也不能修。”五天里，他打了八把钳子、十个羊蹄、四把斧头，每件都有七八斤重。别人问他：“你的劲头为啥这样大啊？”他说：“铁路破好，是咱大家的福，打开陇海路，我的劲头还要大。”
    （二）在组织破路队时，复程一区张楼村，派了三十六名民工，但是全村青年都争着去，要求区里增加人数。他们说：“破了陇海路，咱这里才能安生”。经干部反复解释后，才留下一部人作供给工作。韩朝阳与华作屏同志，带领了单县的八千五百民工，在十一月八日晚，向陇海路前进了，这支队伍带了各式各样的武器——铁锹、抓钩、大小锯、油锤、杠子、绳子、钳子等。在紧密的炮声中，愈加放快了脚步，人群中高声喊出：“切断蒋贼的腿”。陇海路这支蒋匪的动脉，象无能的蛇横躺在我们的面前。
    （三）十一月十号，五分区大破袭已进行了两夜，敌人缩在民权、柳河，不敢动，只是打大炮，放照明弹，给他自己壮胆压惊。但谁理他呢，我们的破队一到天黑，就从老黄河边的千百个村落里出来，奔向铁路边，站上储水塔的火光最大，在火光照耀中，民工们兴奋的掀着炮楼，一会儿几个炮楼、站房都燃烧起来。东边破路队，在劈电杆、扯电线、掀铁轨，象打围一样热闹。当我跑到考城谢滩的一个民工跟前，问他为什么这样带劲时，他回答：“要不是这个买卖——铁路，俺那早就平和啦。马逢乐（蒋匪）仗着这，俺那就没睡过一夜安生觉。”三点大家开始烧枕木了，一堆堆的火焰连接起来，烧红了天，烧毁了蒋匪的腿。
    （四）十一月十五日，从拂晓到黄昏，在陇海路到青＠集的大道上，象铁流一样胜利归来的破路民工，整天没间断。陇海路的人民翻身了，翻身的农民们流露着说不出来的喜悦，每个人都扛着胜利品——砸断的铁轨、大铁钉、电线……，他们边走边说：“这下子可把蒋介石的根掘断了”！“咱把蒋介石的腿打断了”！“把蒋介石的筋抽了”！“咱带的铁钉打铁铣、打抓钩”！“咱带的铁钉当耙齿。”王楼一位四十多岁的民工，走着满劲，我问他：“老大爷，歇歇吧，累不？”“不累，不累，再高兴没有了，吃的都是麦子——得敌人的——还有这胜利品。它个龟孙不容易来了。”（冀鲁豫分社）
