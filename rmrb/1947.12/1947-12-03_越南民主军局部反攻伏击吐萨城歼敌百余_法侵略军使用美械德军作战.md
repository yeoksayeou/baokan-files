Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Comprehensive reports: The Vietnam Democratic Army began a local counter-offensive in both the North and South regions at the end of October. On October 30th, the Viet Minh ambushed a French reinforcement convoy of 40 vehicles, killing or wounding over 120 French aggressor troops. This ambush occurred in Tu Sa City, near the Chinese border, and the battle lasted three hours. French-Vietnamese authorities admitted: "This is the first organized counterattack by the Vietnamese army in a month-long campaign." According to French military communiques, the Vietnam Democratic Army in Cochinchina also continuously attacked French military camps. Recently, in the Lang Son area, the Vietnam Democratic Army successfully intercepted French mechanized units, resulting in over 50 French casualties and only 14 Vietnamese casualties. Recently, Associated Press reporter Stanley, who returned from Indochina, and the Soviet newspaper Pravda on November 27th, both confirmed that 80 percent of the foreign troops used by French imperialism to invade Vietnam are Nazi German soldiers; they mostly wear American uniforms and use American-made weapons. Fearing the resolute resistance of the Vietnamese people, France is attempting to sign a "truce agreement" with Bảo Đại in December and organize a puppet government headed by Bảo Đại, thereby masking the continued persistence of the Vietnamese people's anti-French war of independence. However, a spokesperson for the French Colonial Department had to admit that the Vietnam Democratic Government led by Ho Chi Minh still "has great prestige," while Bảo Đại only receives the support of "30 percent" of pro-French individuals.

　　越南民主军局部反攻伏击吐萨城歼敌百余
    法侵略军使用美械德军作战
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：越南民主军已于十月底在南北地区开始局部性的反攻。十月三十日越军伏击法四十辆汽车增援部队，毙伤法侵略军一百二十名以上，此次伏击战系在邻近中国边境之吐萨城发生，历时三小时即解决战斗。法越当局承认：“这是越南军队在为时一月的战役中首次有组织的反击。”据法军公报称：交趾支那的越南民主军亦不断袭击法军军营。最近在谅山方面，越南民主军阻击法国机械化部队时获胜，法军死伤五十名以上，越南军队伤亡仅十四名。最近由印度支那归来之美联社记者斯坦莱，及十一月二十七日之苏联真理报均证实，法帝国主义用以侵略越南的外籍军队中，有百分之八十系纳粹德军；他们多穿着美国制服，并使用美制武器。慑于越南人民的坚决抗战，法国妄图于十二月份与保大签定“停战协议”，并组织以保大为首的傀儡政府，借此掩盖越南人民的继续坚持反法独立战争。但法殖民地部发言人不能不承认：目前胡志明领导下的越南民主政府仍然“有极大的威信”，而保大只获得“百分之三十”亲法人士的支持。
