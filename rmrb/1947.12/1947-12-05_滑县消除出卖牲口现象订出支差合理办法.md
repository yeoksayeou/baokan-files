[Report from the Jilu豫 Border Region, December 3rd] Since Anshang Village in the Third District of Huaxian County discussed and established a reasonable corvée system, no one in the village sells cattle anymore. Starting this month, Anshang Village discovered that villagers were selling livestock; at the Baliying market alone, the whole village sold six head of large cattle; those who hadn't sold were wavering. The reason was the unreasonable corvée system in the village. The previous method was to organize existing livestock into groups, rotating them for corvée duties. Whoever owned the livestock was responsible for the fodder. Those who didn't own livestock weren't assigned duties, and the drivers and cart attendants weren't counted as fulfilling corvée obligations. This led to complaints from the masses that feeding livestock wasn't worthwhile. When corvée duty fell upon them, they had to manage the fodder themselves. They felt they were "providing labor, effort, and livestock, yet the trip itself wasn't even counted as a duty!" To address the urgent demands of the masses, the leadership convened a meeting of village cadres and mutual aid team leaders to establish a reasonable corvée system for livestock: (1) Livestock is divided into two categories: mules, horses, and cattle receive three jin of grain feed and fifteen jin of grass per head per day; donkeys receive two jin of grain feed and ten jin of grass per head per day. (2) Each cart is accompanied by two people, a driver and a cart attendant, each receiving three jin of rice per day (including fuel and vegetable money). Both manpower and animal power count towards fulfilling corvée duties. Twenty-five li is considered a short distance, and anything beyond that is considered a long distance, with compensation paid daily based on the actual situation. (3) Except for the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned, all households have the obligation to fulfill corvée duties. Livestock is organized into groups and rotated accordingly; manpower, from those aged eighteen to forty-five, is organized into shifts and rotated accordingly. (4) Livestock that are about to give birth are exempt from corvée duties. Cattle are exempt for two months, and donkeys and horses for three months. (5) If livestock dies during corvée duties, the village will compensate one-third of the original value of the livestock. (6) Since landlords have neither livestock nor the ability to bear the burden, their young women will be managed by a designated person from the women's association, who will perform chores such as sewing and washing to offset corvée duties. Their able-bodied young men will also be managed by a designated person from the village, who will find work to make up for corvée duties. After this method was announced to the masses, Liang Deyuan said: "I originally wanted to sell my cattle, but this method is very good. I'll keep feeding them."

　　滑县消除出卖牲口现象订出支差合理办法
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】滑县三区安上村，自群众讨论出合理支差办法后，全村谁也不再卖牛。安上村自本月开始，发现村民出卖牲口，仅八里营一集，全村即卖了大牛六头；未卖的动荡不定。原因是村中支差不合理。以前办法是把现有牲口编成组，平均轮流出差，草料谁的牲口谁负担，不喂牲口摊不着，赶鞭押车的人不算差。这样群众反映喂牲口不合算，有差轮到身上草料自己管，“出人、出力、出牲口，连趟差也不算！”领导上为了解决群众迫切要求，特召开村干互助组长会议，订出牲口合理支差办法：（一）牲口分两样，骡马牛每天每头发料米三斤，草十五斤，驴每天每头发料米二斤，草十斤；（二）每辆车带掌鞭押车两个人，每天每人发给三斤米（柴菜金在内），人力畜力都顶差；二十五里算短差，以外算长差，根据实际情形按天发价。（三）支差户除了鳏寡孤独的老弱户外，一律都有支差义务。牲口编成组，按组轮流；人力自十八岁以上四十五岁以下编成班，按班轮流。（四）支差期间，将要生产之牲口免去支差任务。牛规定免去两个月，驴马免去三个月。（五）在支差上，牲口使死了，村赔牲口原值三分之一。（六）地主既无牲口，又无负担力量，其青年妇女由妇会推出专人管制，打杂缝衣洗浆抵补支差，其有劳力之青壮男人，也由村推出专人管制，出工找补支差。这个办法在群众中宣布后，梁德元说：“我本来想卖牛，这办法很好，我还喂着吧。”
