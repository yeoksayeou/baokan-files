【Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 3rd】 Puyang County has ignited with the flames of revenge, with over ten thousand young people enthusiastically enlisting in the army. After the districts and villages explained the situation in mobilization meetings and conducted village-by-village deliberation and family discussions, the masses recognized that under the current counter-offensive situation, "as long as we make one more effort, the Chiang bandits will be completely eliminated, and the old roots of the landlords will be completely dug up." Connecting this with the blood feuds and righteous indignation over the cruelty and oppression inflicted by the Chiang bandits' Fifth Army earlier in the year, a conscious and voluntary mass enlistment surge has completely erupted. Statistics from the twelve days between the 13th and 24th of this month show that a total of 10,149 people have signed up. At the send-off ceremonies in each village, the new soldiers solemnly swore: "We will not return home until Chiang Kai-shek is eliminated!"

【Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 3rd】 In the enlistment movement in the Fourth District of Puyang, teachers took the lead in organizing a massive propaganda force composed of rural painters, old artists, blind storytellers, those who can write large characters, paper craftsmen, and singing teams. The district leadership attached great importance to the leadership of this work, grasped this powerful propaganda organization, and brought into play the creativity of the lower levels. The entire district is now carrying out propaganda campaigns with enlistment cartoons, slogans, street plays, songs, and poems. Many villages have already painted counter-offensive maps and new slogan cartoons. They have also compiled twenty or thirty scenes of enlistment dramas and songs. Counter-offensive situation maps and enlistment newsletters are plastered all over the major villages. Some people say it's like celebrating the New Year. The Northwest Group has also created many enlistment rhymes, telling true stories about real people in the villages, which children and women sing on the streets, greatly encouraging the masses to join the army. During the deliberation of enlistment in Dingzhai Village, the masses encouraged each other. The women were the first to speak about their suffering. Liu Aiyue, the director of the women's association, said, "My husband was forced to wear an iron hat (using a red-hot pot placed on the head) by the 'Homecoming Corps' and was burned alive!" Saying this, she burst into tears. Tian Yumei said, "My mother is seventy or eighty years old, and she was beaten half to death by the 'Homecoming Corps' last year. I guarantee that my husband will enlist in the army to take revenge." The village instructor said, "I used to only worry about my mother being old and my wife being sick. Now I understand that someone can take care of the family, and I am determined to go with everyone." At this time, young men and women gathered together, and the women put forward conditions, saying: "After you leave, we will guarantee to participate in production at home, be filial to our parents, and participate in public affairs." The young people who are going to join the army also expressed their attitude, saying: "We will definitely do our best in the army." The women then sang a song to send their husbands to the army, and the enlistment atmosphere in the entire venue was extremely high. Furthermore, Zhang Yongsheng from Jia Da Village in the Second District of Puyang is fifty-two years old this year, and there are only four people in his family. He used to work as a hired laborer for the landlord, and the grain he earned could not support the whole family. This year, he was given twenty mu of land in the land reform and had enough to eat and wear. His son, Sanyi, also married a wife. This time, when he heard that young people were being mobilized to join the army, he said to his wife, "I want to ask our Sanyi to sign up for the army. Are you willing?" His wife said, "Why wouldn't I be willing! Thinking back to when the Chiang bandits' Fifth Army came last year, the landlord Sun Xiang forced us to hand over our produce, and adults and children couldn't survive. If we hadn't been liberated early, we would have suffered greatly. I am willing to let our Sanyi join the army. Just talk about our daughter-in-law." Sanyi's daughter-in-law, Qiu Qinglian, heard this and said generously, "I have already made the quilt for him since I came back from the district meeting. I want to make him a pair of send-off shoes." Sanyi was overjoyed when he heard these words and said, "I have wanted to join the army for a long time, but I was afraid that the family wouldn't let me go out. I will sign up and become a model soldier, and we will be reunited after we eliminate Old Chiang." After the whole family discussed it, Sanyi signed up at the meeting, and everyone in the village said that he was a model enlistment family.
