    Poor Peasants Can Start Businesses as Long as They Have Capital
    Hand Towel Weaving Resumes in Former Li Village
    [This Dispatch from the People's Daily, Ji-Lu-Yu, 15th] After the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn tax collection were completed, the villagers of Qian Li Village in the Third District of Weihe carried out a re-examination of their liberation, but during this process most of the people sighed and said, "Although we got a few acres of land this year, most of it was flooded, and we didn't harvest much grain. Today we are examining our liberation, but we still can't escape starvation next spring." Upon hearing this feedback, the leadership immediately gathered all the middle and poor peasants in the village to study the problem. This village originally had more than a dozen hand towel weaving machines, but most of them were closed due to lack of capital. After research, thirteen poor peasant households and two middle peasant households first organized themselves, raising a total of 100,000 yuan in capital. With three machines running, they weave twelve dozen hand towels every day, earning a profit of 6,000 yuan. The remaining households are also brewing ideas and are grouping together to get all the dozen or so machines running. In order to solve the village's capital difficulties, the district is planning to provide loans from the sub-branch of the bank. The masses are all saying, "As long as our machines are all running, the more than 300 people in our village won't go hungry next spring."

    贫农只要有本钱说干就干
    前李村恢复织手巾
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】中贫农团结一致搞副业，解决明春生活困难，卫河三区前李家村织手巾重新搞起来。前李家村在秋收种麦秋征等工作完毕后，即进行翻身检查，开始进行时，大部群众长吁短叹，说：“今年虽分了几亩地，但大部被淹，没打几粒粮食，今天检查翻身，还脱不了来春挨饿”领导上听到这种反映，即召集全村中贫农一起研究。这村原有十几张织手巾机，但因没本钱，大多关了门，经研究后，有十三户贫农，两户中农，首先组织起来，共集资本十万元，三张机子开动，每天织手巾十二打，可赚利六千元。其余各户也正分头酝酿，分组把十几张机子全动起来。区里为解决该村资本困难，正计划向分行贷款，群众都反映说：“只要咱这些机子都动起来，咱村这三百多人，明春就能饿不着。”
