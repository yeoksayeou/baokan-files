The land system in China is extremely unreasonable. Generally speaking, landlords and rich peasants, who account for less than 10 percent of the rural population, own about 70 to 80 percent of the land and cruelly exploit the peasants. On the other hand, hired peasants, poor peasants, middle peasants, and other people, who account for more than 90 percent of the rural population, only own about 20 to 30 percent of the land in total. They work all year round but cannot get enough to eat and wear. This serious situation is the root cause of our nation's invasion, oppression, poverty, and backwardness, and is the fundamental obstacle to our country's democratization, industrialization, independence, unity, and prosperity. In order to change this situation, it is necessary to eliminate the feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land system and implement the system of land to the tillers, according to the demands of the peasants. For twenty years, especially in the last two years, Chinese peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have carried out land reform and have achieved great success and accumulated rich experience. In September of this year, the Communist Party of China convened the National Land Conference. At this conference, the situation of China's land system and the experience of land reform were studied in detail, and the Outline Land Law of China was formulated as a suggestion to the democratic governments and peasant congresses, peasant representative conferences and their committees in various regions. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China fully agrees with this Outline Land Law and hereby promulgates it. It is hoped that the democratic governments and peasant congresses, peasant representative conferences and their committees in various regions will discuss and adopt this proposal, formulate specific measures suitable to local conditions, launch and implement the national land reform movement, and complete the basic tasks of the Chinese revolution.

  　关于公布中国土地法大纲的决议
    中国的土地制度极不合理。就一般情况来说，占乡村人口不到百分之十的地主富农，占有约百分之七十至八十的土地，残酷地剥削农民。而占乡村人口百分之九十以上的雇农、贫农、中农及其他人民，却总共只有约百分之二十至三十的土地，终年劳动，不得温饱。这种严重情况，是我们民族被侵略、被压迫、穷困及落后的根源，是我们国家民主化、工业化、独立、统一及富强的基本障碍。为了改变这种情况，必须根据农民的要求，消灭封建性及半封建性剥削的土地制度，实行耕者有其田的制度。二十年以来，特别是最近两年以来，中国农民在中国共产党领导之下，实行土地改革，已有巨大的成绩及丰富的经验。今年九月，中国共产党召集了全国土地会议，在这个会议上，详细地研究了中国土地制度的情况，土地改革的经验，制定了中国土地法大纲，作为向各地民主政府、各地农民大会、农民代表会及其委员会的建议。中国共产党中央委员会完全同意这个土地法大纲，并予以公布。希望各地民主政府、各地农民大会、农民代表会及其委员会，对于这个建议，加以讨论及采纳，并订出适合于当地情况的具体办法，展开及贯彻全国的土地改革运动，完成中国革命的基本任务。
