Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: The winter training movement of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces in the North Manchuria military regions is deepening step by step. A certain unit of the Mudanjiang Military Region launched "teaching evaluation" and "learning evaluation" in coaching. When evaluating learning, the soldiers reviewed themselves and inspected others, and launched free debates, so that everyone had a consistent understanding of the thinking of training and various actions, further creating an upsurge of mutual teaching and mutual learning. After mobilizing for teaching evaluation, the soldiers of a certain company boldly checked the backward coaching methods of the leadership and some improper work styles of the cadres, gave them severe criticism, promoted righteousness, and strengthened the understanding and unity between officers and soldiers. After the bitter grievances education, the Heilongjiang Military Region launched a mass movement to review party members and recommend candidates for party membership. A certain branch found in this movement that in the past, the absorption of party members and the evaluation of party members mostly relied on the reports of a few comrades, or the subjective feelings of the leadership, and decided without seeing whether he had prestige among the masses, so that some party members could not be approached by the masses, making the relationship between the party and the masses estranged. This time, three party members who had consistently performed poorly in a certain unit were expelled from the party at the unanimous request of the masses; at the same time, more than 60 activists with good backgrounds and upright work styles were recommended by the masses as candidates for party membership, requesting the branch to review them, which made the branch's prestige unprecedentedly improved and the relationship between the party and the outside world closer. A certain unit of the Hekiang Military Region also found that some cadres had poor work styles during training, which hindered the development of the movement. After being corrected by the democratic congress and formulating a "Love Soldiers" and "Respect Cadres" convention, the atmosphere of the entire army has been completely renewed. Currently, the company and platoon, platoon and squad, and individuals are launching a warm training competition.

    民主联军冬季练兵步步深入
    评教评学提高技术
    纠正作风爱兵尊干
    【新华社东北九日电】东北民主联军北满各军区冬季练兵运动步步深入，牡丹江军区某部在教练中展开“评教”与“评学”，战士们在评学时，一面检讨自己，一面检查旁人，并展开自由辩论，使各人对练兵的思想及各种动作得到一致的认识，进一步造成互教互学的热潮。某连队在动员评教后，各班战士均大胆检查领导上的落后教练方法和干部中的某些不正派作风，予以严厉的批评，发扬了正气，加强了官兵间的认识和团结。黑龙江军区在诉苦教育以后，即开展群众性的审查党员和推选入党对象运动。某支部在这次运动中发现了过去吸收党员及评定党员时，多半依靠少数同志的汇报，或领导上的主观感觉而决定，并不看他在群众中是否有威信，以致有的党员不能为群众所接近，使党与群众的关系隔阂。此次某部有三个一贯表现不好的党员，在群众一致要求下被开除党籍；同时并由群众推荐了六十多个成份好，作风正派的积极分子作为入党对象，要求支部加以审查，使支部的威信空前提高，党内外的关系更趋密切。合江军区某部在练兵中亦发现若干干部作风不好，阻碍运动的发展，经民主大会纠正和订出“爱兵”“尊干”公约后，全军空气已焕然一新。现该部排与排，班与班，个人与个人之间正展开热烈的练兵竞赛。
