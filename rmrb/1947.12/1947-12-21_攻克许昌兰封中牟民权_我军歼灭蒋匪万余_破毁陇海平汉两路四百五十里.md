  　　Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan Front, 19th: From the evening of the 13th to the 15th, the People's Liberation Army breached the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, capturing the four cities of Xuchang, Lanfeng, Xinzhongmu (i.e., Bagang), and Minquan. Over 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops were annihilated, including the 40th Division Headquarters, the 1st Cavalry Brigade, and the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division (Note: the 355th Regiment was annihilated for the third time). The spoils of war were abundant, and detailed results are being verified. Currently, 280 li of the Longhai Railway from Zhengzhou to Liuhe (of which 80 li from Quantou to Liuhe was rebuilt by Chiang Kai-shek bandits after the November destruction), and 170 li of the Pinghan Railway from Zhengzhou to Xuchang, have been completely destroyed.
  　　[Our Newspaper] The Baotian Brigade and militia of our Kaocheng County valiantly fought against the enemy's 143rd Brigade and local bullies who had infiltrated the county, implementing village-by-village resistance, persisting in the struggle in the hinterland, and protecting the interests of the masses. On November 22nd, the 143rd Brigade of the enemy's 68th Division, in coordination with local bullies, invaded from the north of the Longhai Railway and occupied the Lvyuanzi area. One company went to Nuanfangzhuang to loot. Our 5th District militia took the initiative to counterattack the enemy and drove them back. After breakfast on the 23rd, the enemy invaded our central area from Lvyuanzi in three directions. Our Baotian Brigade rose up to resist, and successively blocked the enemy three times in Houzhaogou, Qianmalou, Kangzhuang, Kangkou and other villages, covering the safe transfer of many people. The 6th District Armed Work Team used platoon fire to stop the enemy on the levee west of Damazhuang, killing one enemy, and the remaining enemies fled. The 4th District Baotian Team blocked the enemy in Wangzhuangzhai, wounding two enemies. In the evening, the enemy stayed in Wangjurenzhuang, Sizuo Lou and other areas. The militia of Dazhaizhi, Wudazhuang, Xiaoyangko and other three villages touched Kangkou, and drove away six or seven enemies who had come to loot in the village. After breakfast on the 24th, the 428th and 429th Regiments of the enemy continued to attack, attempting to converge at Weiwan. Our Baotian Brigade blocked the enemy twice in Qianhou Wanglou, and when our main force arrived, they defeated a battalion of the enemy. The enemy saw the situation was not good and turned around and fled, and several were killed or wounded. At present, the Party, government, army and people of the whole county are carrying forward the heroic and tenacious spirit of fighting the enemy in the past and are actively fighting the enemy.
