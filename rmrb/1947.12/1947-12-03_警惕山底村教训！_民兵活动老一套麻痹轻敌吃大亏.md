　　Beware of the Lessons of Shandicun!
  　The Old Ways of Militia Activities Lead to Complacency and Underestimation of the Enemy, Resulting in Great Losses
    [Report from this newspaper] On the night of October 30th, more than 180 members of the Kuomintang bandit Bai Long Township and Majie Township puppet self-defense corps in Xiuwu County, detoured through small mountain paths and suddenly surrounded Shandicun and Miaoqiancun in our Fifth District, carrying out large-scale looting. In Shandicun alone, 183 bolts of white cloth, over 800 kilograms of cotton, 25 *shi* of wheat seeds, and 51 head of livestock were looted, and 35 people were captured. Afterwards, the reasons for suffering such losses were reviewed as follows: 1. The militia's activities followed the same old patterns, failing to grasp the enemy's activity patterns, and instead allowing the enemy to grasp their own. The militia assumed that enemy intrusions always involved small-scale harassment after dark or at dawn. The militia always went out before dark for about three hours and then returned, but the enemy instead launched a large-scale encirclement in the middle of the night. Previously, sentries only paid attention to the north of the village, and the masses moved south, but this time the enemy came from the south of the village, catching them off guard. 2. Complacency and underestimation of the enemy led to unreliable intelligence. Enemy situations had changed a long time ago, but this didn't attract attention. 3. The deployment of explosives was not widespread. The enemy feared landmines and dared not enter houses where militia cadres lived. 4. The front-line blockade was not tight enough, allowing the enemy to sneak in through the seven- or eight-*li* gap east and west of Tiejiazhuang. 5. In the past, emphasis was only placed on storing grain, and cotton and cloth were not considered. This time, the enemy looted livestock and cloth on a large scale, leaving many people without cotton clothes to wear.

　　警惕山底村教训！
  　民兵活动老一套麻痹轻敌吃大亏
    【本报讯】十月三十日夜，修武蒋匪白龙乡、马界乡伪自卫团百八十余人，绕走山野小道，突然包围我五区山底、庙前村，大肆抢劫，仅山底村即被抢白布百八十三个，棉花八百余斤，麦种二十五石，牲口五十一头，抓去群众三十五名。事后，检讨遭受如此损失的原因是：一、民兵活动方式老一套，没掌握敌人活动规律，反被敌掌握了自己活动规律，民兵以为敌出犯总是天黑后或拂晓时分的小股窜扰，民兵每天总是天不黑前出去活动，约三小时即回来，但敌却在半夜大股包围。一向岗哨只注意村北，群众向南转移，这次敌人却从村南来，恰恰碰住。二、麻痹轻敌情报不灵，敌情早有变化，而没引起注意。三、爆炸开展不普遍。敌惧怕地雷，村中凡民兵干部住屋均不敢进。四、前边封锁不严密，使敌由铁匠庄东西七八里空子内钻进来。五、过去只强调叫藏粮，不注意棉花布匹，这次敌大抢牲口布匹，致有不少群众当下无棉衣穿。
