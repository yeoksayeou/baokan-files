[This Dispatch] Possessing 125 County Seats
    Our Area Is More Consolidated and Stronger
    The Isolated Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Will Be Completely Annihilated By Us
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Since the great counter-offensive, the Jinji-Luyu Liberated Area has secured its advantage and become more consolidated and stronger, while the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are completely in a defensive state. This newspaper's correspondent recently published a commentary on this favorable situation, stating: As early as New Year's Day this year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits used all their strength to invade and occupy Daming, reaching the peak of their strategic offensive, and from then on, never to return. In April, our army advanced into northern Henan and swept across southern Shanxi. When the Liu-Deng and Chen-Xie armies crossed the Yellow River for the southern expedition, the entire area entered a stage of full-scale counter-offensive. Since the counter-offensive and up to the end of October, our interior troops, combined with the field army, liberated and recovered 18 county seats including Yongnian (only including areas north of the Longhai Railway), annihilating 35,239 enemy troops, and the strategic advantage became increasingly consolidated. Currently, the Jinji-Luyu area, only the interior area north of the Longhai Railway, holds 125 county seats with a population of 30 million. Not only is the entire area connected as one, but it is also unobstructed with the Jin-Sui, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Cha-Ji, and East China major liberated areas. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have never been able to open a single railway. In total, there are less than 200,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits north of the Longhai Railway. Even their so-called main force consists entirely of remnants and defeated soldiers who have suffered annihilation or annihilation blows. These pitiful scraps of metal are anxiously guarding some isolated islands and fragmented transportation lines. Whether they shrink their heads into the tortoise shell or stick their heads out for foolish struggles, they are not enough to save themselves from death. The reporter pointed out: At the beginning of the Self-Defense War, the number of county seats in this area was 113, and now it has increased to 125 in the area north of the Longhai Railway alone. About half of the 25 sub-districts in the interior have been cleared of Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In the four districts of Jinan, Taihang, Taiyue, and Jiluyu, there are a total of 13 sub-districts without any trace of the enemy. Among them, the entire Jinan district has no enemy. In addition, in some sub-districts, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits only have a few precarious isolated islands left. These remaining strongholds will inevitably be completely annihilated by our Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army's interior troops and people's armed forces in future powerful offensives, just like the fate of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yongnian, Yuanshi, and other places.

　　拥有一百二十五座县城
    我区更加巩固壮大
    孤岛蒋匪均将被我彻底歼灭
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫解放区，自大反攻以来，已确保优势，更加巩固壮大，蒋匪则完全处于防御状态。分社记者顷就此一有利的形势，发表评论称：远在今年元旦，蒋匪以九牛二虎之力，侵陷大名，其战略性的进攻即达顶点，从此一去不复返了。四月间我大军挺进豫北，横扫晋南，迨刘邓、陈谢大军渡河南征，全区乃全面转入大反攻阶段。自反攻以来至十月底止，我内线兵团结合野战军解放与收复永年等十八座县城（仅包括陇海线以北地区），歼敌三万五千二百三十九人后，战略优势，日益巩固。现晋冀鲁豫区，仅陇海路以北内线地区，即握有县城一百二十五座，人口三千万，不仅全区联成一片，且与晋绥、陕甘宁、晋察冀、华东各大解放区畅通无阻，蒋匪始终没有能打通一条铁路。总计陇海路北蒋匪不足二十万人，连其所谓主力在内，全系遭受过歼灭或歼灭性打击的残兵败将，这些可怜的破铜烂铁，惶惑不安的守备着一些孤岛，和支离破碎的交通线，不管是在乌龟壳里缩着脑袋，或者伸出头来作愚蠢的挣扎，都不足以挽救其死亡。记者指出：自卫战争开始时，本区县城的数目是一百一十三座，现在仅陇海路北即已增至一百二十五座了。内线二十五个分区中，约有一半已肃清蒋匪。冀南、太行、太岳、冀鲁豫四个区中，共十三个分区已无敌踪，其中冀南全区无敌人。此外，有些分区，蒋匪仅剩下几处摇摇欲坠的孤岛。这些残存据点，在我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军内线兵团与人民武装今后的强大攻势下，亦必将一个一个被我干脆彻底的歼灭，正如蒋匪在永年、元氏等地的命运一样。
