    Yuncheng Emancipated Peasants
    Report Long-Standing Unreported Land
    [Our newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 11th dispatch] The emancipated masses in the first and sixth districts of Yuncheng have reported 34 hectares of unreported land. Since the recovery of Yuncheng, 260,000 people, under the leadership of the People's Government, have been emancipated. In order to thoroughly defeat Chiang Kai-shek and strengthen the counter-offensive forces, during this year's autumn grain collection, they enthusiastically reported the unreported land that had never been taxed since ancient times, paying more counter-offensive grain to their government. × Village, which previously only paid grain for 0.106 hectares (also known as 0.106 Hectare Village), has now reported 4.94 hectares of land. San Guan Miao, which previously only admitted to having 1.06 hectares of land, has now reported 5.07 hectares. Fu Tun, which previously had 20 hectares of land, has now reported 40 hectares of land. Since the counter-offensive, the number of unreported land reported, based on the statistics of the first and sixth districts alone, is over 226 hectares, increasing the counter-offensive grain by 34,000 kilograms.
