　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd—News from Canada: The just wave of Canadian people opposing the Canadian government's aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war with airplanes and arms continues to surge. On the 18th, the Canadian government continued to load over 15 million rounds of rifle bullets worth $1.2 million and hundreds of tons of air force ground equipment at the port of Vancouver (on the west coast of Canada) to send to Chiang Kai-shek. However, the seamen and boilermakers of the Canadian Labor Congress at the port unanimously refused to do this work. The Columbia, originally scheduled to load this batch of arms on the 18th, had to remain docked in the port. The striking workers have formed a picket line to guard the ship and have posted slogans on the dock. Small motorboats carrying striking picketers are patrolling the waters of the port's repair yard. Trucks carrying arms cannot approach the ship because dockworkers refuse to allow these goods to pass through the picket line. The Canadian working class and several universities and religious groups are protesting the shipment of arms. The local branch of the Canadian Labor Federation held a meeting on the 17th and resolved to refuse to load the goods. Attendees included the Canadian National Labor Alliance and some universities. On the 18th, various protest groups, including religious representatives, held another public gathering. It is reported that the Canadian government had already sent the first batch of 2,500 tons of arms to Chiang Kai-shek in early November, and a team from the Royal Canadian Air Force had also arrived in the hands of the Chiang bandits. Canadian workers and students launched an opposition movement in early November.

  　拒绝装运军火援蒋内战
  　组成纠察队巡逻海面禁止军火上船
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】加拿大消息：加拿大人民反对加政府以飞机、军火援蒋内战的正义浪潮继续高涨。加政府十八日在温哥华港口（在加拿大西岸），继续装运价值一百二十万美元的步枪子弹一千五百多万发，和空军地面装备数百吨，送给蒋介石；但该港加拿大总工会所属海员与汽锅工人一致拒绝为此工作。原定十八日装运此批军火的哥伦比亚号轮船，只好停泊在港口内。罢工工人已组成纠察队警戒该船，并在船坞上张贴标语，小汽艇载着罢工纠察员在该港修理厂的海面巡逻。装运军火的卡车不能驶近船只，因码头工人拒绝使这些货物通过警戒线。加拿大劳工阶级及若干大学、宗教团体，皆抗议装运军火。加拿大劳工联合会地方支部曾于十七日举行会议，决议拒绝装货，出席该会议者有加全国劳工联盟及某些大学。十八日，各抗议团体包括宗教代表在内，再度举行公共集会。按加政府已于十一月初将为数二千五百吨的第一批军火送给蒋介石，加拿大皇家空军一队亦已到达蒋匪手中，十一月初加拿大工人、学生即已掀起反对运动。
