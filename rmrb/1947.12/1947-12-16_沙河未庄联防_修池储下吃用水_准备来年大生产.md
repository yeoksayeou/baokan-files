    Shahe Weizhuang Joint Defense
    Repairing Ponds to Store Drinking Water
    Preparing for Next Year's Great Production
    [This newspaper's Shahe News] The six villages west of the second district of Shahe suffer droughts nine years out of ten. Sometimes there isn't even enough water to drink, and people often have to carry water from four or five *li* away. The water in the dry wells and ponds is only enough for this winter's needs, and there will be no water to drink next spring. In order to facilitate production next spring, the village cadres of Weizhuang immediately convened the masses to discuss the matter together. They used more than a hundred workdays to repair a five-*li*-long canal, diverting the water from Baizhuang to the village and filling all the dry wells and ponds. To further solve the drinking water difficulties of the entire joint defense villages, District Chief Li and the cadres of the four villages personally inspected the water conservancy and, after studying it, the cadres of the four villages organized a water conservancy committee to jointly study the pond repair plan, expanding the original pond with an area of ​​one and a half *zhang* in diameter to half a *mu*. The original plan required 1,500 workdays, but after ten days of repairs, using 500 workdays, they dug to a depth of one *zhang* and two *chi*. It seems that 1,000 workdays will be enough to complete all the repairs. In the past, under feudal rule, Weizhuang and Xiaonangou fought lawsuits for three years to compete for water. Now, under the leadership of our democratic government, several villages are closely united, collectively studying and jointly solving the drinking water difficulties. (Guangxue, Zhihe)

    沙河未庄联防
    修池储下吃用水
    准备来年大生产
    【本报沙河讯】沙河二区西六村，十年九旱，有时连吃的水也没有，常到四五里外去担水。旱井旱池的水，只够今冬费用，明春就没水吃。为便利明春生产，未庄村干当即召集群众共同商议。用了一百多个工修渠五里长，将白庄的水引到村中，把旱井、旱池全灌满。为了进一步解决全联防村吃水困难，李区长和四村干部亲自去看了水利，研究以后，四村干部组织起水利委员会，共同研究了修池计划，把原有方圆丈五尺面积的水池，扩大到半亩。原计划工程得一千五百个，现修了十天，用工五百个，就挖了一丈二尺深，看情形一千个工就能全部修起。过去在封建统治下，未庄与小南沟为争水吃曾打了三年官司，现在我民主政府领导下，几村亲密团结集体研究，共同解决了吃水困难。  （广学、志和）
