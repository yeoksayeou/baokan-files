    [Report from Our Correspondent in Western Henan] The mass turnaround movement in Luonan County (洛宁) has unfolded vigorously. Starting from September 20th, after half a month, the masses in the entire county (based on statistics from the first, second, and third districts only) have been largely initially mobilized, with approximately 40,000 people directly participating in the movement or indirectly influenced by it. Around fifty villages have undergone this struggle. Currently, over thirty villages have established peasant turnaround associations. The best-organized is Motou Village, with 120 members, including 20 female members. Peasants have mastered arms in over twenty villages, their weapons mostly seized from landlords. The masses are in high spirits. Chen Song Village is only six li from Luoning City. On the morning of October 1st, when the Chiang bandits invaded Luoning City, the village, under the leadership of activist Zhang Zhong, was in the midst of a struggle by 200 people against the traitor and tyrant, the puppet Bao chief. The sound of cannons was very close and intense, but the masses were not discouraged. When the machine guns sounded, the masses became even angrier and beat the traitor to death. When the enemy invaded Luoning City, the masses spontaneously rose up and organized guerrilla groups. Over sixty people with weapons voluntarily followed the county government.
    Everywhere is kindling, and everywhere can be ignited. The masses in Western Henan, under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang, suffered from conscription, levies, high rents, and heavy interest. Holding deep hatred and resentment, the masses had long hoped for the People's Liberation Army to liberate them. When our army arrives in a place, they demand grain, land, and property from traitors and tyrants to avenge their grievances.
    Initially, in Zhongyu Village and Xiao Yuan Village, the working cadres originally planned to take grain from the homes of traitors and tyrants to help the impoverished. But as a result, the masses dared to directly go to the homes of traitors and tyrants like Zhang Tinghuai in Chen Wu Town and Wei Jingming in Da Yuan Village to carry grain, and even took furniture and other items, forming a "house raid." Not only did people from other villages participate, but also the masses from the local villages. Starting with sixteen people, in half a day, it developed to over a hundred people. After returning, they proposed to establish a peasants' association. In Xiao Yuan Village, thirty-odd peasants quickly joined the association (the entire village only has thirty-odd households). They elected a chairman, vice-chairman, and group leaders, and their morale is high. They are now planning to continue the work.
    In Nancun, in two days, the masses were mobilized to carry grain from the landlord's house; then the masses organized their own workers' and peasants' association and took up arms. Every member of the peasants' association swore: "Brothers and sisters, we are of one heart to turn ourselves around!"
    In Zhongshan Town, in three hours, over a hundred people were mobilized to raid the home of a traitor. Within two days, over four hundred people from Maying Village and Guandi Village were mobilized to jointly raid the home of the local tyrant Song Hua. Then the masses automatically formed groups according to streets or voluntarily, elected representatives, and continued to deepen the action.
    In Chen Song, they first visited poor peasant Zhang Zhong, who had been bullied and humiliated by the traitor who had forced him into military service and raped his wife. He was determined to take revenge. He united three young people and became the leading force of the movement. Then, he contacted tofu sellers, basket weavers, boatmen, and others to hold a meeting, using these people as the backbone. In just two days, they organized a struggle meeting and struggled against the traitor Wei Shengfu.
    (Note: Luonan County is the area south of the Luo River in the original Luoning County, about one hundred li long from east to west, bordering the Luo River to the north and the Funiu Mountains to the south. From the riverbank to the mountains, there is a hilly area of over twenty li, with a denser population and more villages; entering the mountainous area, the population is smaller and the villages are smaller and sparser. The total population of the county is about 110,000. Our focus for mobilizing the masses is in the hilly area.)

    [Report from Our Taiyue Correspondent on the 10th] Peasants in Northern Luo (Ning), Western Henan, publicly try and execute Chiang's traitor Zhao Kerui. Zhao Kerui, a major traitor and tyrant in Zhonghe Village, Third District, of Northern Luo County (the northern part of the original Luoning County), served as the Chiang's Bao chief for many years. After the Japanese occupied Luoning in 1944, he immediately surrendered to the Japanese and served as the captain of the puppet "guerrilla隊," extorting the masses in every possible way. In October of the same year, after our army liberated Luoning, the traitor was captured by us. At that time, the anti-Japanese democratic government, based on its lenient policy, tried to win him over to repent and correct his ways, but the traitor stubbornly continued to oppose the people, rebel with arms, and kill anti-Japanese people. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, our army withdrew, and the traitor served as the "security brigade" chief of Chiang's Luoning County, intensifying his extortion and slaughter of the people and their anti-Japanese families. He had Zhong Heliu, Zhao Tianbao, Zhao Changsheng, Xing Xiaojun, Zhao Shitou, Zhao Hulan, Zhao Wuzi, and others from Zhonghe Village brutally killed. The "security brigade" used severe torture, attempting to exterminate the poor peasants of the village, causing them to be bankrupt and flee in all directions. Zhao Kerui's wolfish heart was not satisfied, and he once again captured them everywhere and put them in prison. Zhao Changsheng died as a result of being tortured. Afterwards, he beat Zhao Hulan's father, Zhao Taizi, to death. Zhao Kerui's crimes of oppressing and harming the people are too numerous to mention. This year, after our army's major counter-offensive south across the river, Luoning County was liberated again. The peasants of the village first proposed revenge against Zhao Kerui. They immediately went everywhere to capture Zhao Kerui. Finally, on November 8th, he was found in Dong Song Village. The masses from Zhonghe and nearby villages, upon hearing the news of Zhao Kerui's capture, immediately rushed to the district office with weapons and dragged Zhao Kerui back. On the morning of the 10th, thousands of people from Shanghe, Xiahe, Nanbei Jiuxian, Zhaozi, Songyao, and other villages also flocked to Zhonghe Village to publicly try Zhao Kerui. At the beginning of the meeting, the compatriots who had been killed by Zhao were first publicly mourned, and then they accused Zhao of revenge. The first was Zhao Hulan, who had a grudge against his father, and he angrily questioned Zhao, saying, "My father was beaten to death by you, wasn't he?!" Zhao bowed his head and said repeatedly, "Yes, yes!" Then Zhao Hulan beat him severely with a stick. People who had grievances came one after another, including two old ladies in their fifties, who angrily beat him and said, "What bad things did you say my child did with the Eighth Route Army?!" In the end, the masses' grievances and hatred had reached their extreme. The whole meeting publicly decided to hand Zhao Kerui over to the people to be executed. The whole audience shouted, "Peasants unite to catch bad guys!" "If you have grievances, redress them, if you have revenge, take it, and get back our blood debts!" "Support the People's Liberation Army, support Chairman Mao!" "We want to turn ourselves around completely!" Currently, the struggle to capture traitors and tyrants, to speak out about grievances and take revenge, has been widely launched in the nearby villages.

    豫西洛南展开群众翻身运动
    三十余村成立翻身会
    二十多村农民已经掌握武装
    洛北农民处死大奸霸赵克瑞
    【本报豫西讯】洛（宁）南县群众翻身运动已猛烈展开。从九月二十号开始，经过半个月的时间，全县群众（仅据一、二、三区的统计），已大部初步发动，有四万左右群众直接参加运动，或间接受运动的影响。经过这一斗争的村子，约有五十个左右。目前已有三十多个村子，成立农民翻身会。组织最好的是磨头村，已有会员一百二十名，其中有二十名女会员。农民已经掌握武装的，有二十多个村，他们的枪支，多是从地主手中夺回来的；群众情绪非常高。陈宋村离洛宁城仅六里，当十月一日早晨蒋匪进扰洛宁城时，正是该村在积极分子张忠领导下的二百群众斗争奸霸伪保长的时候，炮声很近很紧，但群众并不因此气馁。机枪声响起来了，群众怒火更高，就把奸霸打死了。敌人进扰洛宁城时，群众自动起来，组织游击小组。有六十多个人枪，自动随县机关行动。
    到处是干柴，到处能点火。豫西群众，在国民党长期统治下，拉丁、派款、高租、重利，群众抱着千仇万恨，早就盼望人民解放军来解放他们。我军到了一个地方，他们就要求向奸霸地主要粮、要地、要财产，报仇雪恨。
    开始在中峪村和小原村，工作干部们原计划是从奸霸家中取出粮食，救济赤贫。但结果群众还敢于直接到陈吴镇张庭槐、大原村魏敬铭等奸霸家中去背粮，而且还拿了家具物件，形成了“抄家”。不但外村参加，而且本村群众也参加了。由十六个人干起，半天功夫就发展到一百多人。回来后，提议成立农会，小原村很快的就有三十来个农民参加农会（全村仅三十来户）。选了正副主席和小组长，情绪很高，现正计划继续干下去。
    在南村，两天内发动了群众到地主家背粮；然后群众就自己组织了工农会，背起了枪。每个农会会员，都盟誓：“弟兄们翻身一条心！”
    中山镇三小时发动群众一百多人抄奸霸的家。两天内，发动马营村、观底村群众四百多人，联合抄恶霸宋华的家。然后群众自动的按街或自愿组成小组，选出代表，继续深入行动。
    在陈宋是先访贫农张忠，他受过奸霸抓丁、强奸他女人等欺凌和侮辱，决心要报仇。他团结着三个青年，成为运动的带头分子。接着，联络买豆腐的、编筐的、船夫等人开会，以这些人为骨干，只两天工夫，就组织了斗争大会，斗争了奸霸韦生富。
    （按：洛南县，系原洛宁县洛河以南的地区，东西共长百里，北邻洛河，南接伏牛山。从河岸到山边，尚有二十余里邱陵地带，人口较稠，村子较多；进入山地，则人口少、村子小而稀。全县人口共十一万左右，我们发动群众重点是在邱陵地带。）
    【本报太岳十日电】豫西洛（宁）北农民公审处死蒋记奸霸赵克瑞。洛北县（原洛宁县北部）三区中河底之大奸霸赵克瑞，历任蒋记保长，在四四年日本侵占洛宁后，即投日寇充任伪“游击队”大队长，向群众百般勒索。同年十月，我军将洛宁解放后，该逆即被我俘获。当时抗日民主政府本宽大政策争取其返悔改正，该逆却死心塌地，继续反人民携械叛变，并杀害抗日人民。四五年日寇投降后，我军撤退，该逆又任蒋记洛宁县之“治安大队”长，更是变本加厉的大肆敲诈与屠杀人民及抗日家属，曾将中河底群众赵里流、赵天保、赵长盛、邢小军、赵石头、赵胡乱、赵五子等残杀。该“治安大队”并以严刑拷打，企图杀绝该村之贫苦农民，以致使这些农民倾家荡产，四出逃亡。而赵克瑞之狼心未足，再次四处捕捉，下到狱中。赵长盛因此被非刑折磨而死，此后又将赵胡乱的父亲赵太子打死。赵克瑞欺压残害人民之罪恶，举不胜举。今年我军大反攻南渡后，再次解放洛宁县。该村农民首先提出复仇的对象，便是赵克瑞。立即到处捉拿赵克瑞。终于在十一月八日，在东宋村将其搜获。中河底及附近村庄群众，听到捉住赵克瑞的消息，马上带着武器飞奔区公所，将赵克瑞牵回。十日上午，上河底、下河底、南北旧县、赵子、宋瑶等村数千群众，亦涌往中河底村公审赵克瑞。大会开始，首先公祭被赵逆残害的死难同胞后，即向赵逆诉苦复仇。头一个便是有杀父之仇的赵胡乱，他气愤的只是质问赵逆说：“我的父亲是你打死的不是？！”赵逆低头连连说：“是，是！”接着，赵胡乱就把他用棍痛打一顿。诉苦的人连续不断的涌来，其中有五十多岁的两位老太太，气恨恨的打了，又说：“你说我孩和八路军做了什么坏事啦？！”最后，群众诉苦，愤恨已极。全场公决将赵克瑞交人民处死。全场高呼：“农民团结起来捉坏蛋！”“有冤伸冤，有仇报仇，讨回我们的血债！”“拥护人民解放军，拥护毛主席！”“我们要彻底翻身！”现附近各村，已普遍展开捉奸霸诉苦复仇斗争。
