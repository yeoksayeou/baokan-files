Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th. Since the People's Liberation Army surrounded the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 54th Reorganized Division, which had rashly infiltrated Haiyang City, on three sides on the 8th of last month, 3,200 bandits have been annihilated in one month. On the 5th of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 54th Reorganized Division headquarters led its entire 8th Brigade and two regiments of the 36th Brigade, a total of five regiments, and rashly trespassed into Haiyang City from Laiyang City, leaving only the 106th Regiment of the 36th Brigade trapped in Laiyang. The People's Liberation Army immediately besieged the isolated city of Laiyang with one unit, while another unit completed the encirclement of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who had infiltrated Haiyang on the 8th. The city is surrounded by mountains on three sides and faces the sea on one side. After discovering that they were heavily besieged, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits urgently attempted to break through and escape, but were repeatedly defeated and ultimately failed. On the 14th, the bandits used three regiments to break through to the west and northwest of Haiyang, engaging in fierce battles with our forces in Datang, Shihe, Jujian and other places in the suburbs, resulting in the annihilation of more than 1,000 bandits before retreating. On the 17th, the bandits attempted to break through to the west several times in one day but were repulsed again. On the 21st, two regiments of bandits used poison gas to fiercely attack the commanding height of Yuhuangding in the north of the city. After fierce fighting, they were completely defeated by us. In this battle, another 700 bandits were annihilated. On the 27th and 29th, the People's Liberation Army launched attacks in the rain, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the suburbs. In total, 3,212 Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been annihilated in the past month, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Haiyang are still under our siege.
Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Haiyang were besieged and failed to break through, another unit of the People's Liberation Army completely crushed three brigades of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were assisting Haiyang in the Jinshan area, 70 miles northeast of Jimo, from the 25th of last month to the 2nd of this month, annihilating more than 3,600 of them. On the 24th of last month, the 198th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 54th Reorganized Division had just fled from Jiaoxian to Lingshan, 40 miles north of Jimo, and before it could catch its breath, it rashly ventured to assist the east, attempting to relieve the siege of Haiyang. On the 25th, the bandits trespassed into the Jinshan, Shangxiaxianyou, and Xianziwan line and were suddenly surrounded and severely attacked by our forces. On the 27th, Fan Hanjie, the bandit leader of Qingdao, urgently ordered the 76th Brigade of the 9th Reorganized Division, which was waiting to be transported south to escape, and the vanguard of the 57th Brigade of the New 74th Division, which was entrenched in Lingshan, to trespass to Niuqibu, northeast of Lingshan. Before they dared to engage our forces, they turned around and fled like rats. The 76th Brigade then trespassed into Guqian, Nanqian, Woniushan and other areas southwest of Jinshan. On the evening of the 27th, our army launched an attack, first driving a regiment of the 198th Brigade that had trespassed into Jinshan back to Xianyou, and the next morning, annihilated the 227th Regiment of the 76th Brigade at Woniushan in one fell swoop. On the 29th, two regiments of the 57th Brigade, under the cover of nine tanks, once again attacked from Lingshan to the east, but were intercepted and completely crushed by our army after only advancing more than ten miles, destroying two tanks. By the 2nd of this month, all the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, under our heavy blows, retreated to the southwest across the board, and their attempt to assist Haiyang was completely shattered. In summary, more than 3,600 Chiang Kai-shek bandits were annihilated in this battle, and two flame throwers, mortars, 60 mortars, twelve rocket launchers, and fifty-nine light and heavy machine guns were captured.
Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th. The Qingdao suburban and Jidong (newly established county) guerrillas actively launched attacks, and from October 26th to November 10th, they fought a total of 17 battles, killing, wounding and capturing 703 enemies. The Qingdao Armed Work Team killed, wounded and captured 116 enemies at the cost of five wounded and two dead. In the past two weeks, they also burned 15 enemy sailboats.
Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th. The People's Liberation Army recovered Huang County City on the 7th, and the troops of the 42nd Brigade of the 8th Reorganized Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who had invaded the city fled towards Longkou. Huangshanguan, a major coastal town 50 miles southwest of Huang County, was also recovered. Huang County City was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on September 27th.
Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th. With the support of the broad masses of the people and the militia, the backbone local armed forces of the Jiaodong military sub-districts annihilated nearly 10,000 enemies in September and October. According to incomplete statistics, there were a total of 471 battles, large and small, killing and wounding 5,765 enemy soldiers below the battalion commander level, and capturing alive 3,927 enemy soldiers below the township captain level. A large number of weapons were captured, and 58 enemy cars and 13 sailboats were destroyed. More than ten strongholds such as Malan and Shuigoutou were recovered.
