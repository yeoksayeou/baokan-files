　　Only after Thorough Investigation Was the Plight of Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Fully Understood
　　Seize the Time and Speed Up Production
　　Ping Shun Cheng Guan Guarantees That Not a Single Person Will Be Idle This Winter
　　[Report from this newspaper in Ping Shun] In order to carry out winter production and make up for this year's poor harvest, Cheng Guan's leading cadres first conducted a thorough investigation of the poor peasants and hired laborers, carefully calculating the size of their families and possessions, and conducted a comprehensive survey. On the 27th of last month, a meeting of all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women from all major brigades in the village was held to arrange winter production. First, Cooperative Director Yang Changshun explained the village's agricultural production and deficit situation this year. Cheng Guan harvested a total of more than 3,600 *shi* of grain. Calculated according to the grain harvested by all classes in the village, the average is only enough to eat for ten months, leaving a two-month deficit, a shortage of 780 *shi* of grain. If we focus on the poor peasants and hired laborers, then this deficit is too great. For example, Luo Shuanzhu, a newly emancipated household with four people, one able-bodied man and one able-bodied woman, and one ox, harvested a total of 9.2 *dou* of coarse grain this year. After deducting wages and public grain, there are only 2.7 *dou* of grain left. Four people need 9 *dou* of grain per month, which is only enough to eat for three months. The annual net deficit is seven months and two *dou* of food grain. All miscellaneous expenses and seasonal changes in the family need to rely on textiles to solve. Emancipated farmer Qin Maoze has a family of four, one able-bodied man, one able-bodied woman, and one semi-able-bodied woman, with eight *mu* of land. This year, they harvested a total of 8.5 *dou* of grain. After deducting wages, public grain, and repaying debts, there are only 4 *shi* of grain left. If each person consumes 3 *dou* per month (children counted as 1 *dou*), then 4 *shi* of grain is only enough to eat for four months. Then, the political director made an accurate calculation of the tight winter schedule, explaining that this winter's work is heavy and we cannot relax at all. This eliminated the masses' ideas of rest, paralysis, and luck, and made everyone more clear about the importance of this winter's production. Immediately, each team discussed in groups and formulated their own production plans, and each group planned specific production methods. For example, Li Linfu's group opened a mill and a cotton gin, and engaged in transportation. Guo Shunqi's group opened a shop selling coarse rice and simple meals. Now each person has collected five *sheng* of wheat as shares, and the remaining able-bodied people carry pots and bowls to transport grain, while the remaining semi-able-bodied people accumulate and deliver fertilizer. Other groups have also formulated specific plans. Finally, everyone unanimously decided to pass the winter production goals, ensuring that no one would be idle this winter, and that each able-bodied person would earn at least 100 *jin* of millet, and each livestock would earn 200 *jin*. Women used accounting methods to overcome the lax attitude of underestimating textiles, stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for textiles, and actively formulated each person's winter production plan, with each able-bodied person guaranteeing to complete 12 *jin* of textiles, and striving to weave 15 *jin*, solving the specific difficulties of poor and employed women in weaving (loans and credit), and with a courageous spirit, they put forward challenges to men: (1) Guarantee to complete the textile plan this winter and strive to exceed the plan; (2) Guarantee not to buy a foot of cloth for seasonal changes at home. Men also actively responded to the challenge and put forward several conditions: (1) Guarantee to earn 100 *jin* of rice per person this winter; (2) Guarantee not to sell a single grain for all miscellaneous expenses at home; (3) Guarantee not to be idle for a single day this winter, and transport fertilizer whenever there is free time.

　　深入仔细调查才知贫雇窟窿大
    抓紧时间快生产
    平顺城关保证今冬不闲一人
    【本报平顺讯】城关为了进行冬季生产，弥补今年歉收，经主要干部首先深入贫雇进行详密调查，精算大小家当，并作了全面的调查，当于上月二十七号召开全村各大队男女全半劳力会议，布置冬季生产。首由合作社长杨长顺说明了全村今年农业生产及亏空情况，全城关共收粮三千六百余石，按全村各阶层收粮，统一平均计算，只能吃十个月，下亏空两月吃喝，缺粮七百八十石。如以贫雇着眼，那这个亏空就太大了。如新翻身户骆拴柱人四口，男女全劳力各一，牛一头，今年共收粗粮九石二斗，除出工资、公粮外，下余粮二石七斗，四个人每月需粮九斗，只够三个月吃，全年净亏八个月食粮七石二斗，家里的一切杂支、换季均需依靠纺织解决。翻身农民秦毛则，人四口，男女全劳力各一，女半劳力一，地八亩，今年共收粮八石五斗，除应出工资公粮及补欠外，下剩粮四石，每人每月以三斗计（小孩以一斗），四石粮只可吃四个月。继则政治主任又将冬季的紧促时间作了精确计算，说明今冬工作繁重，我们一点都不能松懈，这样扫除了群众的休息、麻痹、侥幸思想，使大家对今冬的生产重要更为明确。随即各队分组讨论，订各组的生产计划，各组并计划出具体生产方式。如李林富组开磨坊、弹花，搞运输。郭顺气组开设店房一处，专卖些粗米便饭，现已每人集股麦子五升，其余全劳力担锅担碗贩运粮食，剩余半劳力积肥送肥。其他各组也都订出了具体计划。最后大家一致决议通过今冬生产目标，保证今冬不闲一人，每个全劳力起码要赚小米一百斤，每头牲口二百斤。妇女用算账办法打通了对纺织轻视的松懈思想，激发了大家纺织情绪，都积极的订出了每人的今冬生产计划，每个全劳力保证完成纺织十二斤，并争取纺织到十五斤，解决贫雇妇女纺织中的具体困难，（借贷与贷款）、并以勇敢的精神向男人提出挑战条件：（一）保证今冬完成纺织计划，争取超过计划；（二）保证家里换季不买一尺布；男人也积极起来应战，也提出了几个条件：（一）今冬保证完成每人赚米一百斤；（二）家里一切零花保证不卖一颗粮；（三）保证今冬不闲一天，有空就运肥。（石永芳、冯海金）
