Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. As a result of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits launching a civil war against the people, not only is Chiang Kai-shek's central finance increasingly bankrupt, but its local finances have also reached the point of "exhaustion." The "Observation" magazine published in Shanghai on the 4th of last month contained an article entitled "Where is Local Finance Going?", which listed the figures of income and expenditure of Chiang Kai-shek's various provinces and counties that are in deficit. For example, Jiangsu Province's income in the second half of last year was about 10.69 billion yuan, and its expenditure was 13.67 billion yuan, with a deficit of nearly 3 billion yuan in half a year. In the 36th year, according to the budget alone, the annual income was 33.510333 million yuan, but the annual expenditure was 72.170333 million yuan, with a deficit of more than double. Jiangxi Province had a deficit of 2.2 billion last year, and it is estimated that it will exceed 12 billion yuan this year. The deficit of various counties and cities in Zhejiang Province in the second half of last year was as high as 27 billion yuan. According to the article, the main reasons for this serious situation are the civil war and corruption. The article stated: Taking Jiangsu Province as an example, the "security fee" used to attack the people last year accounted for 85 percent of the total expenditure, exceeding the total income. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have gradually transferred the tax revenue of various provinces and counties to Chiang Kai-shek's central government to facilitate the annexation by the four families. For example, the land tax was originally set at 60% for the province, but now it is only 20%; the business tax has also been reduced to half for the province; and the special business tax is entirely for the "central government." As a result, the huge deficits of the provinces can only rely on the Chiang Kai-shek's "central" government to issue more currency for subsidies, in addition to stepping up apportionments and plundering from the people. This kind of vicious inflation has led to a decline in currency value, which has further promoted the huge local expenditures. In this way, it "forms a cycle in which the central and local finances are gradually moving towards total collapse."

　　四大家族任意侵吞勒索蒋匪地方财政山穷水尽
    【新华社陕北三日电】蒋匪向人民发动内战的结果，不仅使蒋匪中央财政日益破产，其地方财政亦到了“山穷水尽”的地步。上月四日上海出版之“观察”杂志所载“地方财政往何处去”一文，并列举出蒋匪各省县财政入不敷出的数字，如江苏省去年下半年收入约一百零六亿九千万元，支出为一百三十六亿七千万元，半年中不敷几达三十亿元。三十六年度仅据预算，岁入三百三十五亿一千零三十三万三千元，岁出却为七百二十一亿七千零三十三万三千元，不敷达一倍以上。江西省去年不敷二十二亿，今年估计将超过一百二十亿元。浙江各县市去年下半年不敷数亦高达二百七十亿余元。造成此种严重情况之原因，据该文透露，主要为内战与贪污。该文称：以江苏省为例，去年仅用于进攻人民的“保安费”一项，即占总支出百分之八十五，超过全部收入。蒋匪将各省县的税收日渐划归蒋匪中央以便利四大家族之侵吞，如田赋原定六成归省，现仅二成；营业税也有全部减至半数归省；特种营业税则全部归于“中央”，遂使各省之巨额亏空除向人民加紧摊派掠夺外，又只有靠蒋匪“中央”政府增发通货的补助。此种恶性通货膨胀又造成币值低落，更促成地方支出之庞大。如此就“形成一个中央与地方财政日渐走向总崩溃的循环。”
