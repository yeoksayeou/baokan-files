Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS, Moscow, 6th: Yevgenyev wrote in Pravda that news from China indicates a new upsurge in the Chinese people's struggle for liberation against domestic feudal reactionaries and American imperialism. The offensive of the People's Liberation Army is developing victoriously. In the past four months, the Kuomintang army suffered more than 452,000 casualties. After the summer offensive and reorganization of troops, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army immediately launched the autumn offensive in the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol area and along the Beining Railway. The Kuomintang government had to admit the failure of the Kuomintang army's campaign in Manchuria. Due to the severe economic crisis and intensified semi-feudal exploitation of workers after the war, unemployment and strike movements have grown particularly in Shanghai. Striking workers are not only making economic demands, but also political demands, such as stopping the civil war and stopping American interference. The Chinese countryside is also restless, with peasants resisting the Kuomintang government's conscription of soldiers and grain. The tense political situation in China is not only due to the acute struggle between the Chinese people and the anti-democratic forces gathered around the Kuomintang government, but also due to the Kuomintang ruling clique's traitorous foreign policy, which sells out China's sovereignty in exchange for American handouts. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the Kuomintang's policy of turning China into a colony of American imperialism and a tool for its aggressive plans. The Chinese people's struggle against the "Truman Plan" and the Far Eastern version of the "Marshall Plan" is expanding, because both represent American capital's political and economic domination of China. The Kuomintang, the head of the anti-democratic camp in China, has fallen into a deep political and economic crisis. In sharp contrast to this is the growth and consolidation of China's democratic forces, headed by the Communist Party, which is very significant. The Communist Party calls on Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers, students, petty bourgeoisie, democratic parties and groups, and patriots to organize a united front of the whole people against the instigators of the civil war and their American protectors, and to establish a democratic coalition government dedicated to building a new China of peace, freedom, and democracy. Although the Kuomintang government has American aid and implements a police terror regime throughout the country, it is still powerless to suppress the democratic movement, even with airplanes, tanks, and artillery shipped from across the Pacific. This proves that the Chinese reactionaries and American imperialism have no future and cannot have any future in China.

　　真理报论中国革命新高潮
    人民正胜利扩展攻势
    蒋美反动派没有任何前途
    【新华社陕北八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科六日电：叶夫金耶夫在真理报上撰文称：中国方面的消息表明了中国人民反对国内封建反动派及美帝国主义的解放斗争的新高潮。人民解放军的攻势在胜利地发展中，过去四个月内，国民党军的伤亡在四十五万二千人以上。满洲民主联军在夏季攻势与整编部队后，紧接着就在冀察热辽地区并沿北宁路发动了秋季攻势。国民党政府不得不承认国民党军满洲战役的失败。由于战后严重的经济危机与加紧对工人进行半封建的剥削，所以失业和罢工运动在上海特别增长。罢工工人不仅提出经济要求，且亦提出政治要求，例如提出停止内战，停止美国干涉等口号。中国的乡村也不平静，农民反抗国民党政府的征兵征实。中国政治局势的紧张，不仅由于中国人民与集合在国民党政府周围的反民主力量间的尖锐斗争，而且亦由于国民党统治集团卖国的外交政策所致，他们出卖中国的主权以求美国布施。中国人民对国民党将中国变为美帝国主义殖民地及其侵略计划之工具的政策坚决反对。中国人民反对“杜鲁门计划”及“马歇尔计划”的远东版的斗争正日益扩大，因为二者皆表示美国资本在政治与经济上对中国的统治。中国反民主阵营的头子国民党，已陷于深刻的政治经济危机中。与这成尖锐对照的，是以共产党为首的中国民主势力的增长与巩固，已经十分显著。共产党号召中国工人、农民、士兵、学生、小资产阶级、民主党派与团体以及爱国分子，组织反对内战挑拨者及其美国保护人的全民统一战线，并建立致力于建设和平、自由、民主的新中国的民主联合政府。虽然国民党政府有美国的援助，并在全国实行警察恐怖统治，但也仍无力镇压民主运动，即使它使用由太平洋彼岸运来的飞机、坦克、大炮也是无能为力。这证明了中国反动派与美国帝国主义在中国没有而且不可能有任何前途。
