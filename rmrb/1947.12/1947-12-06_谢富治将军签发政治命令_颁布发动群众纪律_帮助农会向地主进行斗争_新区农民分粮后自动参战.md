At the end of last month, in the battle to smash the Chiang bandit 20th Division's invasion of Fangcheng, peasants from 14 villages in the county voluntarily gathered 32 stretchers, 24 carts, and 7 mules within three hours to go to the front line to help our army transport the wounded and seized materials, with more than 200 poor peasants participating. A certain village was distributing grain when they heard the news, and immediately took the lead by activists to voluntarily organize seven people to participate in the war. In the Lushan area, the masses of a certain town voluntarily organized 17 stretchers at one time to transfer the wounded.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Hubei and Shaanxi, 3rd: The second batch of 116 captured Chiang army officers in the Henan, Hubei and Shaanxi battlefield were released on the 1st. Among them were field grade and company grade officers from the Chiang army's Reorganized 15th Division, Reorganized 3rd Division, and the Zhenping and other county security regiments, including deputy regimental commanders, battalion commanders, and company commanders. When they departed from their residence, the masses beat gongs and drums to send them off, advising them not to fight a civil war for the Chiang army again. The scene was moving, and many Chiang prisoners were moved to tears when bidding farewell to the masses. The first batch of 72 Chiang prisoner officers were released on November 18.
