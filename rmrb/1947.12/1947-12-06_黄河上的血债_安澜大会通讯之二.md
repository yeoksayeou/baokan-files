　　Blood Debt on the Yellow River
    ——Anlan Conference Communication II
    Jun Qian
    In twenty months, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have incurred a blood debt to the people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region along the Yellow River. In March of last year, before the Yellow River arrived, Americans, accompanying the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, pretended to inspect relief efforts and assist in river management and dike restoration, putting on a charitable facade before the people of the liberated areas. In early March, while the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were pretending to help with river management, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Qihe arrested Sun Jitan and Cao Linyuan, cadres from Qi-Yu measuring the Yellow River dike line. Their fate remains unknown. In July, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Changqing brutally murdered Zhang Xingnong, the head of the Changqing repair and defense section, and Du Hequan, the secretary section chief, along with seven others, in Yuanzhuang. In December, they arrested Kong Fanhe, the engineering section chief of Pingyin, and thirteen others. Comrade Liu Jiesan, deputy chief of the materials section of our Third Repair and Defense Office, was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on January 29th and thrown into a well, where he died a tragic death. On April 9th, Shao Honglu and Zhang Xia from Pingyin crossed the river to the south bank to repair dikes. Upon returning after completing the work, their boat was suddenly sunk by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Feng Taiheng's troops, and all personnel drowned in the river. Since the Yellow River's arrival, the Chiang Kai-shek-American planes have carried out even more frantic strafing and bombing of our dike repair workers along the river. On June 12th, while our Changyuan section was carrying out dike repairs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits suddenly raided, shooting and killing our dike repair workers. In Yujiaji, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits massacred 43 civilian workers and injured over a hundred others, even seriously wounding Zhang Ji, the deputy director of our Yellow River Committee. In addition to bombing and massacring our dike repair personnel along the river, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits also looted and burned the materials used along the river. On January 3rd of this year, Ding Shuben's troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits burned 40,800 catties of straw and 1,920 wooden stakes in our Kunwu section and looted 20,020 catties of hemp rope. On February 16th, two Chiang Kai-shek planes dropped incendiary bombs on our straw material factory in Daxingzhuang, Juancheng, burning over 100,000 catties of straw and 2,000 wooden stakes, and shooting and destroying five of our material transport boats. The boats and materials made by the people that were burned and bombed were too numerous to count. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits secretly sent special agents to sabotage the dikes built by the people. During this year's major floods, Liu Ruming of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits secretly sent special agents Wang Jinshan, Zhao Zhongchen, and others to cut over 1,000 catties of dam rope and 160 catties of iron wire at the Jiangsu Dam, a major hazardous project on the Yellow River. They stole more than 300 wooden stakes, causing the Jiangsu Dam hazard project to present a dangerous situation. When the Juancheng Democratic Government immediately mobilized 1,500 people to actively repair it, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits transferred a regiment of Hu bandits from Zhengzhou under the command of Liu Ruming, forcibly occupied Juancheng, and on the night of the 25th, taking advantage of the heavy rain, raided the people repairing the Jiangsu Dam. In June, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits dug dikes everywhere on the south bank of the Yellow River, digging a large ditch two meters wide and deep and one li long in Nanwang and Laojun Village, Shou's Zhang. In mid-June, the 72nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits used the first dam of the hazardous project in Beizhong as a bunker, digging a large pit one meter wide and deep and two meters long at the hazardous project, and a ditch more than 50 meters long. On August 12th, Zhao Zhenting of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breached the Guanmeng Dike in two places in Dong'e Bay and Xinzhuang, Guantai, and the first, second, third, and fourth districts of our Quhe County (newly划county, composed of the borders of Fengqiu, Changyuan, Lanfeng, and Kaifeng counties), that is, 132 villages were flooded, affecting 39,460 people, inundating 116,765 acres of land, and destroying 9,780 houses. Our blocking project used a total of 33,671,400 catties of straw, 100,000 catties of hemp, more than 134,000 stakes, 610,000 catties of willow branches, 38,920 catties of lead wire, 224,710 cubic meters of soil, and 5,209 sacks. On September 29th, the 72nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army breached the junction of Huangdi and Jindi in Huanghuasi, diverting the rainwater from Yun and Juancheng into Kunshan, inundating more than 50 villages. Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandits released the Yellow River water, there were 1,044 villages affected in the riverbed, affecting 266,286 residents, with 910,583 acres of land inundated and 64,972 houses completely collapsed into the water. The number of casualties among personnel along the river was 2,406, with 613 captured, 1,342 killed or injured by Chiang Kai-shek-American planes strafing and bombing, 397 killed or injured by Chiang Kai-shek bandits shelling from across the bank, 54 brutally murdered and assassinated, 403 large vehicles transporting work materials bombed, 881 livestock killed or injured, and 296 ships destroyed (214 bombed, 82 burned). Hazardous projects sabotaged included Jiangsu Dam, Guonali, Yangji, Zhongdui, Sunkou, and Wangzhuang, six places. The embankments of Changyuan, Juancheng, Yuncheng, Kunshan, and other counties were damaged for 246 kilometers. Breaches occurred four times at hazardous projects such as Guantai, Huanghuasi, and Linpu. The total damage to Yellow River materials such as straw, hemp, lead wire, stakes, and tools amounted to 50,000 million yuan (Hebei currency). The people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan have won the victory over the Yellow River through arduous struggle, but the blood debt owed to the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan by Chiang Kai-shek and the Americans will be repaid to him sooner or later.

    君谦
    在廿个月里，蒋匪在黄河线上欠了冀鲁豫人民的血债。去年三月，黄河还没来的时候，美国人伴随着蒋匪，假装着视察救济、帮助治河复堤，在解放区人民面前装得一幅慈善面孔，三月初蒋匪正在假装着帮助治河的时候，齐河的蒋匪却将我齐虞测量黄河堤线的干部孙继坦与曹林园捕去，至今生死不明。七月，长清蒋匪在袁庄惨杀了我长清修防段段长张兴农和秘书股长杜鹤全等七人。十二月，又将我平阴工程股长孔繁鹤等十三人捕去。我第三修防处材料副科长刘杰三同志，在一月二十九日，为蒋匪捕去后，投入井中惨死。四月九日，平阴段邵洪鲁与张侠二人，渡河到南岸修堤，工毕返回时，突被蒋匪冯太恒部将船击沉，所有人员全被淹死在河中。自黄河来后，蒋美飞机对我沿河复堤的员工，施行了更疯狂的扫射与轰炸。六月十二日，我长垣段正进行修堤之时，蒋匪突然出扰，射杀我修堤工人，在余家集被蒋匪残杀民工达四十三名、受伤百余名，连我黄委会副主任张暨也受到重伤。蒋匪除对我修堤沿河人员轰炸惨杀外，对我沿河所用之材料，亦加以抢掠和焚烧。今年一月三日，蒋匪丁树本部，将我昆吾段秸料四○八○○斤、木桩一九二○根烧毁，并抢去麻绠二○○二○斤。二月十六日，蒋机二架，在我鄄城大邢庄，向我秸料厂投燃烧弹数枚，烧毁秸料十万余斤、木桩二千个，并射毁我运料船五只，人民制造的船只及材料被烧毁炸毁者实在太多了。蒋匪对人民所修成的堤坝，曾暗派特务破坏，在今年大泛到来之际，蒋匪刘汝明秘密派特务王金山、赵中臣等，在黄河大险工江苏坝割坝绳一千余斤、铁丝一百六十斤，盗去木桩三百多根，江苏坝险工顿呈险状。鄄城民主政府即动员一千五百人正积极抢修之际，蒋贼又自郑州调来胡匪骑一旅归刘汝明指挥，强占鄄城，于二十五日乘大雨之夜，奔袭江苏坝抢险人民。六月蒋匪在黄河南岸大堤上，到处挖堤，在寿张南王、老君村挖二公尺宽深的大沟一里路长。六月中旬蒋匪七十二师，在北仲＠堆将险工的第一道坝作碉堡，将该险工处挖一公尺宽深，二公尺长的一个大坑，并有五十多公尺长的一道沟。八月十二日，蒋匪赵振庭在贯台东鹅湾与辛庄一带，将贯孟堤扒开两处，我曲河县（新划县，由封邱、长垣、兰封、开封四县边境组成），一、二、三、四区，即有一三二个村庄被淹，受灾者达三九四六○人，淹没土地一一六七六五亩，毁房屋九七八○间，我堵口工程，计共用秸料三三六七一四○斤、麻十万斤、桩十三万四千余根、柳枝六十一万斤、铅丝三八九二○斤，土二二四七一○方、麻袋五二○九条。九月二十九日，蒋匪军七十二师，将黄花寺黄堤金堤交界处扒开，将郓、鄄雨水灌入昆山，淹没五十余村。自蒋匪放下黄水后，河床受灾村庄即有一○四四个，受灾居民达二六六二八六人，被淹土地九一○五八三亩，房屋全部倒入水中者六四九七二间，沿河人员伤亡者二四○六名，被捕者六一三名，为美蒋机扫射轰炸死伤一三四二名。隔岸为蒋匪炮击死伤者三九七名，被残杀暗害者五四名，运工料大车被炸四○三辆，牲口死伤八八一头，船毁二九六艘（炸毁二一四只，烧毁八二只），被破坏险工有江苏坝、国那里、杨集、仲＠堆、孙口、汪庄六处。长垣、鄄城、郓城、昆山等县堤岸，被破坏二四六公里。在贯台、黄花寺、临濮等险工，决口四次。黄河物资秸料、麻、铅丝、桩用具等，共损毁合五万万元（冀钞）之巨。冀鲁豫人民在艰苦的奋斗中，赢得了对黄河的胜利；但蒋美所欠下冀鲁豫人民的血债，早晚是要向他索还的。
