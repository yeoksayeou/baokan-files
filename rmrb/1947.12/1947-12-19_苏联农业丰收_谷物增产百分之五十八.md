Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Moscow dispatch: According to Soviet Minister of Agriculture, N.A. Benediktov, on the 14th, "The Soviet Union's grain harvest this year has increased by 58 percent compared to last year, and by 400 million poods compared to 1913, one of the most abundant harvests in old Russia. The increase in industrial crops is even greater, with flax increasing by one time, mustard by eight times, and sunflower seeds by 50 percent. The output of sugar beets has doubled, and as a result, Soviet sugar production this year will increase by 53,000 tons compared to last year. According to recent incomplete statistics, the increase in livestock production in collective and state farms has exceeded the plan. According to the plan, the number of cattle should increase by 11 percent this year, sheep by 18.7 percent, and pigs by 35.5 percent. The five-year plan for the overall increase in livestock production is unprecedented in speed and scale in the world. The number of sheep in the Soviet Union has set a world record. Therefore, the Soviet Minister of Meat and Dairy Industry recently stated that the meat and dairy production, which had been reduced due to the loss of more than half of the livestock during the war, will soon be restored and exceed the pre-war level, and he predicted a large increase in butter, cheese, and sausages. The bumper harvest of crops and the breeding of livestock have greatly improved and increased the living standards and incomes of farmers, and have made the shelves of city stores increasingly full. This year, the deposits of Ukrainian collective farms in the Agricultural Bank have increased by 60 million rubles compared to last year, and they have purchased 3,500 automobiles and agricultural machinery worth 230 million rubles. In the Krivoy Rog region, collective farms can obtain an average of four kilograms of grain and seven rubles worth of vegetables, meat, and milk per person per day. According to Soviet Minister of Domestic Trade, Liqimov, 26,000 new stores have been established throughout the Soviet Union this year, and will reach 30,000 by the end of the year. The goods sold in the first nine months of this year increased by 36 percent compared to the same period last year."
