Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 17th: According to TASS, Moscow: Following the issuance of the decision on currency reform and the abolition of the rationing system, the entire Soviet people are filled with joy and pride, expressing unanimous support. Active members of the Communist Party in the capital held a special meeting on the 14th, expressing deep satisfaction with the wise policies of the Party and the government, and resolving that: "This decision of historic significance fills the hearts of our people with pride in our powerful Soviet motherland and proves to the world that socialism is infinitely superior to capitalism. The welfare of the Soviet people is rising with the surging tide of Soviet economy, culture, and science." TASS reporters sought the views of people from all walks of life on this decision. Ignatyeva, a nurse at the Chaizniski District Clinic, said: "I feel proud of my country and my people. In a short period, it has healed the wounds of war and strengthened its economic power to the point of abolishing the rationing system." Retired Colonel Vladimir said: "During the war, I walked through many enemy-occupied areas, and I also interrogated dozens of German officers and soldiers. They usually carried tens of thousands of fake rubles. We also often found boxes of fake rubles hidden in cellars when the fascists retreated. Anyone who has seen these things firsthand will understand the necessity of currency reform." Balisheva, the director of the Comingtern District Kindergarten, said: "The abolition of the rationing system once again proves how much the Soviet government cares about the material welfare of the people." Pannov, a locksmith at the Stalin Automobile Factory, said: "The working class in France and Italy is forced to take mass strikes to seek some improvement in their material conditions. Although the Soviet Union suffered greater losses in the war than any other country in the world, today, after two and a half years of peaceful labor, we can abolish the rationing system. From now on, every worker will be able to buy two or even three times as much food and consumer goods as before with his wages. I assure the government and Stalin that we will work harder to make the power of our socialist motherland grow stronger day by day." Famous writer Gorbatov pointed out: In capitalist countries, currency reform is accompanied by rising prices, increased unemployment, and a new attack on the working class. "And the Soviet government's currency reform takes improving the living standards of the working people as its supreme goal. We have all made the sacrifices required by the government with joyful hearts, because this sacrifice is needed for a noble purpose."

    国家威力增强物质生活上升
    苏联人民欢欣自豪
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：货币改革与配给制废除的决定颁布后，全苏人民洋溢着欢欣、自豪，表示一致拥护。首都共产党积极分子特于十四日举行会议，对党和政府的英明政策深表满意，并决议称：“这一历史意义的决定，使我国人民的心中充满着对我们强大的苏维埃祖国的自豪，而且向全世界证明：社会主义比资本主义无穷的优越。苏联人民的福利，随着苏联经济文化与科学的滔天大浪而上升着。”塔斯社记者曾征询各业人民对这一决定的观感。柴兹尼斯基区门诊部护士伊格纳蒂叶娃说：“我为我的国家、我的人民觉得骄傲。它在短短时期内，便治愈了战争的创伤，和加强经济力量到废除配给制的程度。”退伍军人乌拉地米尔上校说：“战争时期，我曾走过许多敌占区，我也审问过几十名德国官兵，他们通常带着几万假卢布。我们也常常发现法西斯在败退时隐藏在地窖里的一箱箱假卢布。每一个曾经亲眼看过这些事情的人，都会明了货币改革的必要。”康明坦恩区幼稚园园长巴利希娃说：“废除配给制，再次证明了苏维埃政府对人民的物质福利是多么关怀。”斯大林汽车工厂装锁匠潘诺夫说：“法国与意大利工人阶级被迫采取群众性的罢工，以求得物质情况的某些改善。苏联虽然在战争中遭受的损失比世界上任何国家都大，可是，在两年半和平劳动之后的今天，我们便可以废除配给制了。此后，每一个工人便能以他的工资，买到两倍甚至三倍于以前的粮食与消费品。我向政府与斯大林保证，我们要更努力工作，使我们社会主义祖国的威力更与日俱增。”名作家高尔巴托夫指出：在资本主义国家，随着货币改革而来的，是物价的高涨，失业人数的增加，和对工人阶级的新进攻。“而苏联政府的货币改革，则是把改善劳动人民的生活水准作为它至高无上的目的。我们都以欢欣的心情作了政府所要求的牺牲，因为这一牺牲是为高尚的目的所需要的。”
