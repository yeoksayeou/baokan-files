　　 Pingding Shexian High Schools Break Old Restrictions
　　 Absorb Poor and Hired Laborer Children as Much as Possible
    [Our Newspaper Pingding News] Pingding No. 1 High School held a school affairs meeting on October 11th. Based on the demands of the masses, it was decided to absorb a large number of emancipated children to help them become emancipated culturally. Because peasants were poor in the past, their children had no opportunity to attend school. Now that they are older than primary school age, they cannot pass the high school entrance exam. In response to these demands from the parents of emancipated children, the school decided to break the old examination system and truly serve the masses. This winter, it will absorb a large number of emancipated children to study. They only need a letter of introduction from the district or township government. Currently, more than thirty emancipated children have arrived at the school as new students. (Yu Zhen, Ai Lou)
    [Our Newspaper Shexian News] Shexian's Seventh District is the poorest area. In the past, most poor peasants could not attend school. After the Seventh High School clarified its policy of running schools for the poor and hired laborers, at the beginning of this semester, they all went to the countryside to mobilize emancipated children to enroll in school. During the mobilization, they realized that the emancipated peasants' demand for cultural emancipation was very urgent. For example, Wei Luju, a poor and hired youth from Dagang, said: "I wanted to go to high school to study a long time ago, but I'm stupid and don't know a single character, I'm afraid I can't do it!" Zhang Fulai's father said: "I want Fulai to go to high school, but I can't afford it. Although we have been allocated some land, we haven't taken root yet. This year is another bad year, and there is no rice at home. The food at high school is good, how can we afford to go to high school?" Ren Jinxing's father from Shiti said: "In the past, we only picked up firewood, and we couldn't even feed ourselves, how could we go to school? Now that we have land to cultivate, we must let Jinxing go to school for a few days! But rice is difficult!" After understanding these problems, we patiently explained and explained that the old society forced us not to go to school. Today's high school is our peasants' school, and our children should be allowed to enroll. It doesn't matter if they are illiterate. We also calculated the accounts for them: the firewood is cut by the students themselves (using Sundays to cut), and they don't need to pay for it. We have vegetables at home, so we can eat more vegetables and less rice. Our school eats three catties of vegetables and twelve ounces of rice a day, which is not more expensive than eating at home..." After persuasion and mobilization, in six days, sixteen poor and hired youths (male), one female, and eight middle peasants (male), totaling twenty-five people, were mobilized from eight villages to come to the school. Their ages range from fifteen to twenty-five years old. Their learning enthusiasm is very high. They have now begun to be assigned to classes and start classes. (You He, Cheng Xian, Shu Cheng)

　　平定涉县高小打破老一套限制
  　尽量吸收贫雇子弟
    【本报平定讯】平定一高，在十月十一日召开校务会议，根据群众要求，决定吸收大批翻身子弟，帮助他们从文化上翻身。农民因为以前家穷，子弟没入学机会，现在到初小年龄大，到高校考不上。校里针对翻身子弟家长们的这些要求，决定打破了旧一套的考试制度，真正做到为群众服务，在今冬要吸收大批翻身子弟入学读书，来时要有区材公所负责介绍信的手续即可。现新生到校的已有三十余个翻身子弟。（玉珍、爱楼）
    【本报涉县讯】涉县七区是个最贫苦的地方，过去一般的贫苦农民，都不能上学，七高校明确了为贫雇办学校方针以后，所以在这一学期，一开始就都分头下乡动员翻身子弟入学，在动员中认识到翻身农民对文化翻身的要求非常迫切。如大港贫雇青年魏禄巨说：“咱早想上高校学习，就是咱心笨，不识一个字，怕不行！”张福来的父亲说：“有心叫福来上高校，就是上不起，咱虽分到些土地，可是还没扎下根，今年又给了个赖年景，家里没有米，高校吃的好，咱怎能上高校呢？”石梯任金香的父亲说：“以前光拾砍，顾嘴还不行，那能上学呢？现在有了地种可是要叫金香上几天学哩！就是米困难！”了解了这些问题，便耐心解释？说明过去的旧社会逼迫的咱不能上学，今天的高校就是咱农民的学校，应该叫咱子弟入学，不识字也可以。又给他们算了算帐：柴是学生们自己割的（利用星期日割），不用拿钱买，蔬菜咱们家里都有，可以多吃菜少吃米，咱学校一天吃三斤菜，十二两米，这样也并不比家里吃的费啥……。”经过说服动员，六天在八个村里动员到校的贫雇青年男十六人，女一人，还有中农男八人，共廿五人，年龄均在十五岁以上二十五岁以下。他们的学习情绪很高。现在已开始编班上课。（友鹤、承先、树成）
