　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 26th dispatch] The Guxian Town Cooperative in Qin County has improved its business approach and is now fully focused on supporting winter production for the masses. First, it has transferred the iron furnace operated by the cooperative to the masses. The pharmacy has reduced its funds, withdrawing 300,000 yuan, and, in conjunction with some of the floating capital of the masses, has sent specialists to Lüliang to buy livestock for the masses. Second, it has organized three carpenters to make accelerated spinning wheels and looms for the masses. To improve the narrow cloth of Qin County, it has also spent 55,000 yuan in Nanchen Village to order 57 looms for the masses that can weave cloth one foot and three inches wide. It also plans to first make one accelerated spinning wheel for each of the four women's teams for experimentation and promotion. The carpenters have already repaired 22 broken wheels for the women weavers, and the cooperative has lent two catties of cotton to impoverished women weavers who cannot afford cotton, with 32 catties already lent out. At the same time, to enable women to focus on weaving, the cooperative is responsible for hauling coal and selling it to the masses at the lowest price. Third, the cooperative has provided loans to support Yao Laibin and others to open an oil mill. Fourth, Yao Yutang and other impoverished laborers earn 13,800 yuan (currency unspecified) each time they carry oil from the cooperative to Guodao for sale, netting 10,800 yuan after expenses. Fifth, to support mass transportation, the cooperative often has specialists outside contracting for goods, and if the masses cannot sell the goods they carry back immediately, the cooperative buys them. Therefore, the cooperative is now supported by the masses.

　　古县镇合作社改变方针
  　全力扶助冬季生产
    【本报太岳廿六日电】沁县古县镇合作社改进业务方针，现已全力放在扶植群众冬季生产上。第一、首先将合作社经营的铁炉转让给群众，药铺紧缩了抽出卅万元款，结合部分群众的游资，派专人到吕梁为群众买牲口。第二、组织了三个木匠，给群众割加速轮纺车与拉梭机，并为改进沁县的窄面布，又以五万五千元在南陈村为群众订购五十七口能织一尺三寸宽面布的＠，又计划为四个妇女分队各先割一架加速轮纺车，以供实验推广。现木匠已为纺织妇女修理坏车二十二架，买不起棉花的雇贫纺织妇女，合作社每人借给二斤花，现已借出三十二斤。同时为了使妇女全力纺织，合作社负责拉煤以最低价格出卖给群众。第三、合作社贷款扶植姚来宾等开一座油坊。第四、姚玉堂等几个雇贫，在合作社担油到郭道出卖，每人一回可赚洋一万三千八百元，除开支外，净赚一万零八百元。第五、为扶植群众运输，合作社常有专人在外包揽货物，群众担回货来一时卖不了，合作社就买下，因此现在合作社得到群众的拥护。
