Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. According to TASS reports: The London Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting continued its discussion of the preparatory procedures for the German peace treaty on the 2nd and 3rd, and has now concluded. The most important topic of the meeting was the Soviet proposal: "The agreements of the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences should serve as the basis for the preparation of the German peace treaty." This Soviet proposal put the US, Britain, and France, who harbored ulterior motives and attempted to undermine the Potsdam and Yalta agreements, into an extremely embarrassing situation. Marshall initially said: "I have nothing to say," while Bevin remained silent. Molotov immediately and righteously questioned: "The representatives of the US and British governments, who participated in the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions, are showing no interest in the resolutions of the conferences." At this point, Marshall had no choice but to falsely claim that the United States also cared about the Potsdam and Yalta agreements, but sophistically argued that the US and the Soviet Union had different interpretations of the two agreements. Bevin and Bidault also hemmed and hawed, avoiding a direct answer. Molotov then proposed that since the US, Britain, and France were unwilling to discuss this, the four countries could specifically submit draft proposals for the basis of each country's preparation for the German peace treaty within two months, so as to avoid delaying the preparation of the German peace treaty due to the failure to decide on basic principles. Although the US, Britain, and France could not hide their conspiracy to act willfully, they stubbornly refused to accept the Soviet proposal. The meeting also discussed the issue of the composition of the peace conference. The Soviet Union advocated that the German peace conference should include the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, China, and the allied countries that bordered Germany or participated in the war against Germany with their armed forces. The opinions of France and Britain were similar to those of the Soviet Union. Molotov stated: "The viewpoints of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France can reach an agreement." Marshall was extremely embarrassed, but still stubbornly insisted that all countries in a state of war with Germany should be invited to participate, his purpose obviously being to include countries like Turkey, which only declared war a few days before Germany's surrender and were subservient to the United States, in the German peace conference, thus encountering Soviet opposition. As a result, Britain, the United States, and France accepted the Soviet proposal and handed the case over to the foreign ministers' assistants for further study. The third important issue discussed at the meeting was the composition of the consultative conference in the organization drafting the German peace treaty. The Soviet Union advocated that, according to the decision of the New York Foreign Ministers' Meeting, representatives of the four powers and the allied countries bordering Germany and those who fought against Germany should participate. The United States, however, attempted to use the "majority" to control the drafting of the treaty, advocating that all countries that declared war on Germany should participate. Although this proposal did not yield results, Marshall's extremely stubborn actions even made Britain and France dare not openly agree, putting himself in isolation. The meeting on the 3rd also turned to discuss the Austrian peace treaty issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. London Dispatch: The British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, revealed on the 2nd a secret plan by the United States to split Germany, stating: The United States plans to merge the American, British, and French occupation zones in Germany, and will soon establish a political organization, named the "Tri-Zone Committee," whose composition includes the prime ministers of the western German states. The core of this organization will represent the informal government of the three occupation zones. This plan was prepared under the pretext of establishing a unified Germany before the London Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting convened. American monopoly capitalists are already actively operating in western Germany. US Ambassador to Britain Douglas has submitted the plan to the British government and has obtained the British government's consent. At the same time, the US and Britain also plan to retain their huge military institutions in Berlin.

### 外长会议讨论对德和约问题告一段落  苏联保卫历次决议美英法陷极端窘境

　　外长会议讨论对德和约问题告一段落
    苏联保卫历次决议美英法陷极端窘境
    【新华社陕北七日电】据塔斯社报导：伦敦四外长会议于二日及三日继续讨论对德和约准备程序，并已告一段落。会中最主要之议题为苏联所提：“雅尔塔和波茨顿会议之协议，应作为对德和约准备工作之基础”一案。苏联此一提案使心怀鬼胎、力图破坏波茨顿与雅尔塔协议的美英法，陷入极端之窘境。马歇尔最初说：“我无话可说，”贝文则缄默不语。莫洛托夫立即义正辞严的追问称：“参加雅尔塔与波茨顿决议的美英两政府之代表，对于会议之决议竟表示毫无兴趣”。至此马歇尔只好伪称美国也关心波茨顿与雅尔塔协议，但诡辩美苏对该两协议的解释各有不同。贝文与比道尔也支吾其词，力避正面答复。莫洛托夫继而提出：既然美英法不愿对此加以讨论，四国可于两个月内具体提出各国对德和约的准备基础的草案，以免对德和约之准备，因基本原则未决定而被延宕。美英法至此虽无法掩盖其蓄意孤行之阴谋，但仍顽固地拒绝接受苏联之建议。会议中又曾讨论和会之组成问题。苏联主张对德和会包括苏美英法中及与德为邻或曾以其武装力量参加对德作战之盟国。法英两国的意见与苏联相近，莫洛托夫表示：“苏英法之观点能达到协议”。马歇尔极为狼狈，但仍固执一切处于对德战争状态的国家都应被邀参加，其目的显在企图将服从美国的土耳其等仅在德投降前几天宣战的国家，包括在对德和会内，因此遭受苏联的反对。结果，英美法接受了苏联的建议，将该案交与外长助理继续研究。会上讨论之第三项重要问题为起草对德和约的机构中的谘询会议的组成问题。苏联主张按照纽约外长会议之决定，由四强代表和与德为邻之盟国及对德作战之国家参加。美国则图利用“多数”对起草和约予以控制，主张对德宣战的国家都要参加。这一议案虽未获结果，但马歇尔之极端顽固之行动连英法也不敢公然附和，而使自己陷入孤立。三日之会议并转入讨论对奥和约问题。
    【新华社陕北七日电】伦敦讯：英共机关报工人日报，于二日揭露美国分裂德国之秘密计划称：美国计将德境美、英、法三占领区合并，并即将建立一个政治机构，取名为“三区委员会”，其组成中包括德国西部各州的总理，这一机构的核心将代表三占领区之非正式政府。这个计划在伦敦四外长会议开会以前，即以假装建立统一德国为口实，从事准备。美国独占资本家，已在德国西部积极活动。美驻英大使道格拉斯已将该计划呈递英政府，而且得到英政府的同意。同时美英又计划保留他们在柏林的庞大军事机构。
