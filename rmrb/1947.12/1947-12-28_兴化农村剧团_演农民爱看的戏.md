Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th -- The rural theater troupe composed of liberated farmers in Xinghua, Subei, is flourishing. In the past four months, 47 theater troupes and 32 entertainment groups, large and small, have been established in all eight districts of the county, with a total of 810 members. According to statistics from 17 of these troupes, they have performed 325 times, with a total audience of 153,000 people, and have created 183 kinds of plays and ditties. In order to implement the policy of serving class brothers, the theater troupes perform plays that expose the crimes of feudal landlords, such as "Han Yongying's False Enlightenment," during the re-examination movement, and "Three Attacks on Pingri Village" to coordinate with the struggle in the border areas. When the situation is tense, the theater troupes disperse to various villages to carry out activities, collecting materials on the one hand and conducting current affairs education for the masses on the other. The county-level theater troupe has created a mass line approach to creation. For example, when compiling the play "Han Yongying's False Enlightenment," they first collected preliminary materials from comrades working in the village, determined the content, and assigned roles. Then, the actors dispersed to understand the materials and vocabulary of the characters being played, compiled dialogue, and invited local people to participate in collective revisions. After the first performance, they went deep into the masses to collect opinions, and completed the play after two major revisions and more than 20 minor revisions by the masses. In the theater movement, they personally experienced that using drama as education and mobilization work is most easily accepted by the masses.
