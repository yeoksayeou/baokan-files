    Taiyue, December 13th (From Our Newspaper) Qinshui continues to check the hired and poor peasant line in production. The First District convened a cadre meeting on the 27th of last month to specifically study how to thoroughly resolve the winter production difficulties of the hired and poor peasants. At the meeting, when conveying the county committee's winter production policy, it was particularly emphasized that whether or not the hired and poor peasant line could be followed was key to winter production. A review was also conducted of the district's past work. The chairman of the Wangzhai Village Farmers' Association, examined how in the past they dared not lend to hired and poor peasants, fearing they would not be able to repay, but when the landlord Kong Fanbin requested a loan, he was given 3,000 yuan. The chairman of the Shitang Village Farmers' Association also reviewed, saying: "Once, when a mutual aid team helped the families of soldiers participating in the war with sowing and weeding, the hired and poor peasants only earned six points for a day's work, while the objects of struggle earned nine points." Chen Jiutao, a hired and poor peasant from Miaogou Village, tearfully recounted how the village head forced him to plow the land with the landlord Ma Defu, resulting in the landlord's land being plowed, but his own land not being plowed. After three days of review, everyone realized that for the past year, the production work had largely followed the rich peasant line, with no consideration for hired and poor peasants anywhere. This winter, it is imperative to resolve the difficulties of hired and poor peasants in production, resolutely control the landlords, and the following concrete difficulties for hired and poor peasants in production were decided upon: (1) Absorb idle capital and combine it with the labor of hired and poor peasants to develop production; (2) Confiscate the landlord's shares in the cooperative and give them to hired and poor peasants; (3) The cooperative should combine capital with the labor of hired and poor peasants and implement labor-capital profit sharing; (4) All 3.84 million yuan of winter production loans in the district should be lent to hired and poor peasants; (5) Transportation that does not require capital should be prioritized for hired and poor peasants.

    沁水一区研究冬季生产
    明确贯彻贫雇路线
    【本报太岳十三日电】沁水继续检查生产中的雇贫路线，一区于上月廿七日召开干部会议，专门研究如何彻底解决雇贫冬季生产困难。会议上，传达县委会的冬季生产方针时，特别提出能否走雇贫路线，则是冬季生产的关键，并对本区已往工作作了检讨，王寨村农会主席，检查已往贷款不敢贷给雇贫农，恐怕他们还不起，但地主孔繁宾要求贷款，却贷给他三千元，石堂村农会主席，也检讨说：“某次互助组给参战民工下种锄苗，雇贫每天做活只顶六分工，斗争对象却顶九分。”庙沟村雇贫陈九桃，痛哭流涕诉说闾长强令其与地主马德福合犋垡地、结果将地主的地垡完了，自己的地未垡完的事。经过三天的检讨，大家认识了一年来生产工作大部是走了富农路线，处处没有雇贫观念，今冬一定要解决雇贫生产中的困难，坚决管制地主，并决定解决雇贫生产中的具体困难：（一）吸收游资与雇贫的劳力结合，发展生产；（二）没收地主在合作社的股金，交给雇贫；（三）合作社以资金结合雇贫的劳力，实行劳资分红；（四）全区冬季生产贷款三百八十四万元，全部贷给雇贫；（五）不需要资本的运输，先尽雇贫。
