(Our newspaper's Jinan, Hebei, report on the 8th) Ganji Town, Ninth District, Wei County, has launched a mass movement to support the families of soldiers resisting landlords, with the families of soldiers sending letters to encourage new soldiers to work hard to destroy Chiang. On November 25th, a symposium of new and old families of soldiers was convened. Village cadres reviewed the past inadequacies in caring for the families of soldiers, apologized to the families, and allowed the new and old families to raise their own difficulties. New soldier families Wang Yiqing and Zhang Weiting said: "My child went to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and the village sent a plaque, and the women's association keeps coming to visit. I feel very honored. I have no difficulties at home. With everyone's support, I want to write to my child and tell him not to come back until he defeats Chiang Kai-shek." At this meeting, the families' organizations were reorganized, responsible for managing and solving the difficulties of more than 120 families. After the meeting, a mass meeting of the whole village was convened, emphasizing that everyone should solve the difficulties of the families of soldiers in the future. Then, groups were formed to inspect and discuss the difficulties raised by the families. Wang Tiancheng said: "When I plowed the land for Haiyin's family, I plowed very shallowly, just going through the motions, because I thought it was troublesome, not as deep as I plowed for myself, I'm really sorry." Wang Jin said: "I can't deliver water to the families of soldiers on time." After the inspection, the difficulties raised by the families were discussed one by one. Those without houses will build houses next spring and temporarily live in the houses that the farmers' association has not allocated. When calling for volunteers to work for the families, Wang Tiancheng said: "I used to do a bad job for the families of soldiers, and today I will voluntarily carry water for Wang Liliu's family." Many people volunteered to carry water, chop firewood, and weed for the families. Everyone said in unison: "They are fighting Chiang Kai-shek at the front, and we are helping their families with work, which is our duty." The wives of Li Yuhua and Jing Hongqin (families of soldiers), who are about to give birth, have also been arranged to be taken care of. Manpower and animal power were allocated according to the specific circumstances of the families. Finally, it was passed at the meeting to concentrate all labor to chop cotton stalks for the new and old families of soldiers. The east street has been completed in a surprise attack, and other streets are under attack. The families of soldiers are happy and say: "It's faster than when my people were at home!" The families of soldiers have sent letters to their children and husbands, explaining the support of the villagers and instructing them to fight Chiang Kai-shek with peace of mind and repay the support and love of the people. The whole village sent a total of forty-six letters to new soldiers. The wife of new soldier Li Yuhua wrote in her letter: "Since you joined the army, the neighbors have been constantly coming to express their sympathy, and I am very happy in my heart... Mother will be well taken care of by me, even better than when you were at home. Work and water carrying have been arranged. Li Youqi, Li Hongxun, and Li Yuhai voluntarily work for our family. What you are most worried about is that when I give birth, no one will take care of me, but now it has been arranged, in addition to our mother, the women's committee member Hong Runjia lives with me. Because we have no rice this year, the neighbors are also preparing to give us some red millet, and plan to buy some odds and ends. I hope you don't worry about the family outside. Just wait until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek and reunite!"

　　干集抗属函勉出征子弟：
    家中优待没困难打倒蒋贼再团圆
    【本报冀南八日电】威县九区干集镇，掀起群众性优抗运动，抗属纷纷信勉新战士努力灭蒋。十一月二十五号，召集了新老抗属座谈会。村干检讨了过去对抗属照顾不周的地方，并向抗属道歉，让新老抗属提出自己困难问题。新抗属王义清、张为廷说：“孩子去打老蒋，村里送匾，农妇会里又不断的来看望，我觉着这就挺光荣啦。我家里什么困难也没有。大家伙这样拥护，我要给孩子去信，叫他打不倒老蒋不要回来。”在这个会议上，整理了抗属组织，负责管理与解决一百二十余户抗属的困难问题。会后又召开了全村群众大会，强调提出：今后大家伙都要解决抗属困难。接着分组检查并讨论抗属所提出的困难。王天成说：“我给海银家耕地时，耕的很浅，是应付公事，嫌麻烦，不如给自己耕的深，真对不起人家。”王金说：“我给抗属担水，不能按时担。”检查后又挨户讨论抗属所提出的困难。没房的，明年春天盖房，暂时住农会没分的房。号召自动给抗属作活时，王天成说：“我过去给抗属作的活不好，我今天要自动给王立柳家担水。”很多人都争着给抗属担水、砍花柴、锄草等。大家都异口同声的说：“人家到前方打老蒋，咱帮着人家家里作活，是应尽的责任。”李玉华、井洪琴的老婆（抗属），快生孩子，也都按排好了人照顾。人、畜力按抗属的具体情形进行了分配。最后在会上通过，集中所有劳力，给新老抗属砍棉花柴。现东街已突击完毕，其他街上正在突击，喜的抗属都说：“比俺那人在家里时作的还快哩！”抗属都纷纷给自己的子弟丈夫去信，说明村里群众拥护的情形，嘱咐在外放心好好打老蒋，报答人民的拥护热爱。全村计有四十六封信寄给新战士。新战士李玉华老婆信上说：“自你参军后，街坊不断来慰问，我心里很喜欢。……母亲由我好好侍候，比你在家时照顾的还要好。作活担水都按置好了人。李有其、李洪训、李玉海自动给咱家作活。你最挂心的是我到生孩子时没人照管，现在也按排好人了，除咱母亲外，有妇女委员洪润家给我同住。因咱今年没米，街坊们还准备给咱点红谷子米，并打算买点零星东西。希你在外边别挂念着家庭。单等打倒老蒋咱再团圆吧！”
