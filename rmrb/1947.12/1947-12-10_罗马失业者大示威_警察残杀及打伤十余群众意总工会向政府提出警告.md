    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Rome—On the evening of the 5th, unemployed people in the suburbs of Rome held a large demonstration to protest unemployment. Police attempted to disperse the demonstrators, leading to a conflict in which one demonstrator was killed and more than ten were injured. In response, the Italian General Confederation of Labour issued a resolution demanding that the perpetrators be severely punished, 10 billion lire be allocated to develop public works to reduce unemployment, and unemployment benefits be provided. The General Confederation of Labour also warned that unless the government agrees to these demands before December 9th, Rome will call for a general strike.
