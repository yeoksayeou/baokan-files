    [This Newspaper Taiyue 13th Dispatch] Our troops along the Tongpu Railway, in the grain protection battle, maneuvered to attack the enemy. On the 3rd, at Zhukeng Village, east of Pingyao, they routed the First Regiment of Yan's 44th Division, killing or wounding more than 20 enemies, capturing 3 alive, and seizing one small cannon, two light machine guns, and five rifles. On the 4th, at Caoma Village, Jiexiu, three Yan's "compiled village" bandits who were looting grain were captured alive, and three rifles were seized. On November 27th, more than 180 Yan's bandits from the Huiquan, Zhengji, and Yanzhao township governments of Xiangling who were looting grain were routed by us in Eli (15 li southwest of Linfen), killing or wounding two bandits, capturing six alive, and seizing four rifles and 150 rounds of ammunition.
    [This Newspaper Taiyue 8th Dispatch] The grain protection battle in Jiexiu continues to be victorious. At dawn on November 25th, a part of our Yuebei Local Corps, in coordination with a part of the Independent Battalion combat team, ambushed in the villages of Xialiang, Jianli, Shanglinghou, Xialihou, and Liugou in Jiexiu. At 9 a.m., more than 30 enemies from Nanwang’s "compiled village" and the pseudo-Yian Third District detachment set out to loot grain in Liugou. When the enemy entered the village, our guerrillas launched a surprise attack, capturing eight enemies in ten minutes, killing four enemies including the detachment leader Guo Shili, and seizing eight rifles, one small cannon, one pistol, and 150 rounds of ammunition. The enemy hurriedly fled in the direction of Donghulong, and was ambushed again by us, killing three enemies, capturing five alive, and seizing one machine gun and three rifles. Another group of enemies arrived at Xialihou and were captured alive by our militia while "compiling villages," seizing one rifle. The enemy did not dare to advance and fled back the same way. At 10 a.m. on the same day, the First Battalion of Yan's Security 18th Regiment of Sendai, with two large carts and more than 30 porters, went to Manli Village to loot grain. Our combat team and the villagers' militia fought heroically. When the bandit troops fled, they took advantage of the victory to pursue. Another unit of our troops, ambushing at Fendui, also rushed from the north at this time, and the ambush troops at Xialiang also surrounded them at the same time, completely capturing them. We had no casualties. In this battle, a total of 56 enemies were captured, 20 were killed, and 6 machine guns, 5 small cannons, 44 rifles, and 1 pistol were seized. In the three days from November 23rd to 25th, more than 100 enemy security police from Jiexiu's security police detachment looted grain from our Hedong Village three times, but were repelled by our Hedong militia, wounding two enemies, without taking away a single grain. On the 26th, the militia of the Hedong Bee Joint Defense Zone jointly attacked the enemy security police detachment who were looting grain, repelling the enemy, intercepting 14 heads of livestock, and rescuing 12 captured people, totaling four battles with the enemy in three days, achieving complete victory, and demolishing the enemy's Longtou bunker. Two militiamen from Shitun, using the method of "hawk catching chicken," captured alive Wang Peng＠, a major deputy regimental commander of the 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division, and a part of important documents on the night of the 17th from Liujia Street, Shitun Village.
    [This Newspaper Taiyue 12th Dispatch] Since November, in the 25-day grain protection battle, the Yuebei Local Corps has annihilated more than 580 bandits, seizing 3 heavy machine guns, 18 light machine guns, 7 small cannons, and more than 180 rifles (the results of the guerrillas and militia are not included). Yan's bandits' brutal grain looting has suffered a serious blow, and their military deployment has also been disrupted by us. During this period, Yan's bandits in Pingyao and Jiexiu used significant forces (regiment or battalion) to add temporary strongholds and carry out frantic activities, attempting to squeeze our guerrillas and militia from the plains to the mountains, while also bringing out various miscellaneous diehards to plunder the people, digging caves and looting grain. In early November, they twice invaded our Qinyuan border to loot grain. In early November, our army took the initiative to attack, and in the battle of Zhangbi in Jiexiu on the 6th, annihilated a battalion of the 219th Regiment of the 37th Division, shocking Yan's bandits. Within one or two days, they successively withdrew strongholds from Nanbeizhuang in Jiexiu, Jingsheng in Lingshi, and Gaobi, and did not dare to engage our small armed activities. By the 14th, about six regiments of the 34th Army invaded Wanghe area of Qinyuan again to loot grain. On the 16th, they were pincered by our main force on both the east and west sides. After a fierce battle all day, more than 300 bandits were killed or wounded. On the 17th, the enemy quickly fled back to their original nest. On the 25th, a part of our main force took the initiative to attack the enemy in the Sendai area of Jiexiu, winning three victories in one day and annihilating 78 bandits and miscellaneous diehards looting grain. Since then, small units of dozens of Yan's bandits have not dared to come out to loot grain easily. At the same time, the 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division, which had fled to Qixi, Qixian, and Xiaoyi, was hurriedly withdrawn to the Nanwangli area of Jiexiu.
