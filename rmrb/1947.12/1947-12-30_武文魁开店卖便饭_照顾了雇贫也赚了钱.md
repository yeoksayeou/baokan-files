　　Wu Wenkui Opens a Restaurant Selling Simple Meals
  　Caring for Poor Laborers and Making Money
    [This newspaper's Pingding dispatch] Wu Wenkui's shop in Yingzhuang Village cares for poor laborers transporting goods and also makes money. He is a poor peasant and knows the suffering of poor people when they are out and about. His shop is also considerate of the poor in every way. He often tells the transporting masses who stay at his shop: "We are all poor brothers who have only just stood up. Let's all cook together and eat some millet. Don't waste it. Saving 500 yuan a day, saves 5,000 yuan a trip. After ten trips, you'll have saved two 'shi' of millet, which is enough for one person to eat for half a year." His business policy is: "Lesser profits, more business, then we'll make money." Eating millet is calculated thirty yuan less per 'sheng' than other villages. Drinking water and lodging are free. The beds are heated at night. Customers who can afford a quilt are allowed to sleep on the edge of the heated bed, and those without quilts sleep in the middle. People on the road who could have traveled another ten or eight 'li' stop here, saying: "Staying at Brother Wenkui's shop gets us a heated bed and a full stomach." Since the beginning of autumn, he has had no fewer than ten customers a day, netting 74,800 yuan in three months. Under his influence, all fourteen shops in Yingzhuang Village have unanimously proposed to open shops for the poor laborers transporting goods. On average, forty to fifty transporting laborers stay in Yingzhuang Village every day. Those staying there often say: "Even if we have to hurry a few more steps, we must stay at Brother Wenkui's shop. We can't stay in the cold shops of Ceyu and Gudong."

　　武文魁开店卖便饭
  　照顾了雇贫也赚了钱
    【本报平定讯】营庄村武文魁的店房，照顾了雇贫运输也赚了钱。他是个贫农，知道穷人出门的痛苦，他的店房也处处为雇贫着想，他常向运输住店的群众讲：“咱们都是穷兄弟，才翻了身，大家起火吃些小米就好，不要浪费，一天省五百，一趟省五千，连走十趟就省两石小米，就够一人半年吃。”他的营业方针是：“利轻些，生意多了就赚钱。”吃小米比别村一升少算三十元，喝水住房不要钱，晚上烧的是热炕，能赁起被子的客人让在炕边睡，没被子的在当中睡。走路的人到了营庄，本来还能赶十来八里路，就停留下来了，他们说：“住文魁哥店占热炕、吃饱肚”。从开秋以来每天不下十个客人，三个月净赚七万四千八百元。营庄十四个店房，在他的影响之下，一致提出要为雇贫群众运输开店，营庄每天住店的运输群众，平均总在四五十人，住店的常这样说：“多赶几步也要住文魁哥的店房，可不住测鱼、谷洞店的冷冰房”。　　（二专通讯组）
