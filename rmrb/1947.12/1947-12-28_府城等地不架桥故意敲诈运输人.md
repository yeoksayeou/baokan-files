　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 26th dispatch】In Anze County, Fucheng, Jiuxian, Hongdong, Zian and other places, due to neglecting transportation construction and the purely profit-driven behavior of roadside inns, winter transportation and production are hindered. According to the person in charge of the Jia Zhuang transportation team in Tunliu, the Qin River section in Fucheng, Anze County, has a large river flow. When we were hauling rails, people would build a bridge but not add planks, specifically using boats to ferry vehicles for profit. Each empty vehicle was charged 400 yuan for transportation, and loaded vehicles were charged 800 yuan. As a result, many vehicles were waiting by the river and unable to pass for a while. On the 13th, when we returned, the bridge had been built, but every vehicle passing over the bridge had to pay 200 yuan for "wine money" (because the bridge builders drank water). In addition, there are four rivers between Zhujia Kiln and Jiuxian that have not yet been bridged. Vehicles have to wade through the water to pass. From Anze to Zian in Hongdong, the roadside inns are scattered and sparsely populated, specializing in selling bowl noodles at high prices. Lodging, other than noodles, offers no other food. For example, the inn in Zian Village sells noodles for 150 yuan per bowl, with small bowls and few noodles. Some people can't get full even after eating eight bowls. Therefore, the transportation team worriedly said: "After passing the Ten Mouth Pass (the junction of Antun), put on a hat of sorrow!" Furthermore, according to the person in charge of the Tunliu County Winter Association, Tunliu organized 40 vehicles to transport rails to Hongdong this time. Each vehicle spent 500 yuan for the trip, 200 yuan for bridge fees on the return trip, and another 600 yuan to cross the Fucheng River. The total expenditure for all vehicles reached 2.6 million yuan. Moreover, when crossing the Fen River, the bridge was not yet built, and each vehicle had to expend an average of one work day. Thus, 4,000 man-animal workdays were wasted in vain. Now, the Tunliu Winter Committee is sending people to negotiate with the First Administrative Office, hoping to immediately repair the bridges and eliminate the unwarranted tolls on the bridges, as well as correct the purely profit-driven views of the inns, to facilitate mass transportation.

　　府城等地不架桥故意敲诈运输人
    【本报太岳二十六日电】安泽县府城、旧县、洪洞、紫岸等地，因忽视交通建设，及沿途车店的单纯营利，妨碍了冬季运输生产。据屯留贾庄运输队负责人谈，安泽府城沁河段河水较大，我们拉铁轨时人家架上桥不搭板，专门用船渡车赚钱，每载一辆空车索运费四百元，重车八百元，因之往来许多车辆都等在河边，一时过不去。十三日返回来，桥已搭成，可是凡通过桥上的，每辆车得索酒钱二百元（因搭桥人下水喝酒）。此外，从朱家窑到旧县间，还有四条河，至今未架桥，车辆过往都得淌水。从安泽至洪洞的紫岸，沿途车店区域零星，起火专卖碗面，住店除面以外，别无其他食物。如紫岸村车店卖面，每碗一百五十元，碗小面少，有人吃八碗还吃不饱。因此，运输队发愁的说：“过了十门口（安屯交界处）戴上愁天帽”！又据屯留县冬季会负责人谈，此次屯留组织四十辆车到洪洞去运铁轨，每辆车前去化车费五百元，回来化桥钱二百元，过府城河再化六百元，全部车仅零支即达二百六十万元，而且过汾河时桥未搭起，每辆车又须平均费一个工，于是四千个人畜工就白白浪费了，现屯留冬委会正派人向一专署交涉，希望立即把桥梁修好，并从此取消桥上不应有的索取，以及纠正车店的单纯营利观点，以利群众运输。
