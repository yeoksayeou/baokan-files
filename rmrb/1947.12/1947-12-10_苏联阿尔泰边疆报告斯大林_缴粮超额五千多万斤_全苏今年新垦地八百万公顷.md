　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Moscow dispatch: All Soviet newspapers yesterday published on their front pages, in prominent positions, a report from the Altai Territory (located in southwestern Siberia, with a population of over 2.5 million) to Stalin on the astounding achievement of exceeding the grain procurement plan. The report stated: "The Soviet state farms and collective farms in the Altai Territory, as of the first of this month, have delivered 2 million poods (one pood equals 27 catties) more grain to the state than the required amount. The development speed of Soviet agriculture this year has exceeded that of the pre-war period. During the five years before the war, the average annual increase in sown area was 2 million hectares, while this year it has increased by 8 million hectares compared to last year. The land planned to be reclaimed next year is even more than this year, totaling 10 million hectares. The total area of the two largest capitalist agricultural countries in pre-war Europe, Germany and France, is only over 18 million hectares each, which is only equal to the newly cultivated land of the Soviet Union in the next two years. To date, the sowing of Soviet winter crops has been successfully completed, with the sown area also increasing by 3.1 million hectares compared to last year. The rapid development of Soviet agriculture is mainly based on mechanization. This year, farms across the Soviet Union have received 34,000 new tractors, and this will increase to 67,000 next year.

　　苏联阿尔泰边疆报告斯大林
    缴粮超额五千多万斤
    全苏今年新垦地八百万公顷
    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科讯：全苏各报昨日均以一版头条地位，刊载阿尔泰边疆（位于西伯利亚西南部，人口有二百五十余万）向斯大林报告超过缴粮计划之惊人成就。该报告内称：“阿尔泰边疆苏维埃农庄与集体农庄，迄本月一日止，缴纳之公粮已超过应缴数额二百万普特（一普特合二十七斤）。苏联农业今年发展速度已超过战前，战前五年内平均每年播种面积增加二百万公顷，今年则已较去年增加八百万公顷，明年预定开垦之土地较今年尤多，计达一千万公顷。战前欧洲资本主义最大农业国德、法两国之全部面积，不过各为一千八百余万公顷，即仅等于苏联今明两年之新垦地。迄今为止，苏联冬季作物播种业已顺利完成，播种面积亦较去年增加三百一十万公顷，苏联农业之高速发展乃以机械化为其主要基础。今年全苏农场获得新拖拉机达三万四千架，明年更将增至六万七千架。
