　　Don't Just Look at the Surface Activity
　　Thorough Investigation Reveals Many Difficulties in Employing Poor Peasants
　　[Our Shahe News] After Zhengzhao Village, in the Sixth District, was organized and solved some of the production difficulties for employed poor peasants, the cadres thought everything was fine and that winter production was underway. In order to deepen the movement further, thoroughly and comprehensively solve the difficulties of employing poor peasants, and truly mobilize the poor peasants, the leadership conducted individual investigations and found that some employed poor peasants still had no way out. For example, Gao Jiannian, with a family of five, had been a worker in coal factories at the railway station since he was a child. He only returned after liberation. This year, he harvested seven bags of grain, which was not enough to eat. He wanted to partner with others in transportation. Also, Ma Chenyou's family, with two people, harvested four bags of grain and five dou of corn, which was also not enough to eat. He invested in large cooperatives and small cooperatives by selling cabbage. He wanted to start a small business, but he didn't have the capital and hadn't taken action yet. In addition, the employed poor peasants in the first and fifth groups wanted to produce but raised difficulties that were not resolved. After discovering these problems, a meeting of cadres was immediately convened to study and review. This shows that we were satisfied with the initial organization and action, thinking that we had come up with solutions for them or that some employed poor peasants had already taken action, so we thought the problem was solved. In fact, we are far from that. This also shows that our service to the employed poor peasants is not thorough enough. It's like walking; we have a hundred steps, but we have only taken one step. If we want to do a good job, we really have to move forward. As long as there is one employed poor peasant who hasn't taken action, we must mobilize and organize him to take action. Deputy Village Chief Fu Chun said: "I didn't fully mobilize the employed poor peasants before, always feeling that some employed poor peasants had little ability, so I didn't do a good job." At the same time, some cadres spent too much time on trivial matters, such as divorce, marriage, and getting angry, and did not put all their efforts into promoting winter production, failing to distinguish between what was important and what was not. After the review, they all went to each group to conduct further inspections and help the employed poor masses who had not yet taken action to get moving quickly. At the same time, it is also necessary to unite the middle peasants (without letting the middle peasants suffer losses) to further deepen the winter production movement.

　　不要光看表面热闹
  　正招深入一访查雇贫困难还不少
    【本报沙河讯】六区正招村，经过组织起来，解决了一部雇贫生产困难后，干部们又以为万事大吉了，认为冬季生产搞起来了。领导上为了使运动更加深入一步，彻底的全面的解决雇贫困难问题，真正把雇贫农民都发动起来，又个别作了访查，发现仍有雇贫没有办法，如高建年，家里五口人，他从小就在车站上煤厂里当工人，解放以后才回来，今年他打了七布袋谷子，还不够吃，很想和别人合伙运输。还有马臣有家，两口人打下四布袋谷子，五斗玉茭，也不够吃，他往大合作社和小型社里集股都是卖的白菜，做个小生意吧，又没本钱也还没有动弹起来。另外第一组和第五组的雇贫想生产，提出有困难，也没解决。发现了这些问题后，马上即召集干部开会，研究检讨，这是我们满足于开始的组织和行动，认为给他们想出了办法或有一部分雇贫已经行动起来后，就算解决了问题，实际上，还差的多哩，这也说明咱们为雇贫服务的还不彻底，就和走路一样，咱们有一百步，现在才迈了一步，要想把工作搞好，正经还得往前走哩，只要还有一个雇贫还没动起来，咱们就要发动和组织他动弹起来。副村长傅春的说：“我从前就没有放手发动雇贫，总觉着有些雇贫能耐小，所以没搞好。”同时，某些干部多误工在零星问题上，如离婚、结婚、生气等，没有拿出全部力量来推动冬季生产，没有分清轻重。检讨以后，都分头到各组去，再进行检查，再帮助没动起来的雇贫群众，赶快动起来，同时，还要团结中农（不让中农吃亏），使冬季生产运动更深入一步。
