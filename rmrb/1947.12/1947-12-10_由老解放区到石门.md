From the Old Liberated Area to Shimen
    Chen Sen

    I. News of Victory

    The sun was shining warmly overhead. Suddenly, the village bell rang "clang, clang." People immediately put down their rice bowls and ran to the main street. The primary school students ran while shouting, "Folks, Shijiazhuang is liberated!" People greeted each other, spreading the word: "Shimen is liberated!" Before long, the threshing ground in the south of the village was packed with people. Dozens of young men held hands and jumped for joy, some leaping high in the air. An old man holding a bowl of rice reached out his large, rough hand to shake mine: "Happy, Comrade..." As if offering New Year's greetings and congratulations, he couldn't close his toothless mouth. A white-haired old woman also came over, holding her hands together in front of her chest, nodding repeatedly at everyone, saying, "Good, good, good, this is really good!" She was so moved that she couldn't say anything else.

    The students brought out a big drum and began to beat it loudly, so loudly that people could only see each other's smiling faces and couldn't hear what anyone was saying. A group of men, women, old, and young lined up behind a large red flag and started to perform the Yangko dance. The sky seemed to be covered with laughter. Someone led the crowd in shouting, "Long live the liberation of Shimen!" "March to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" "Long live the Communist Party! Long live the People's Liberation Army!" Everyone raised their fists high, their voices loud and clear. Victory inspired the people.

    This was exactly what I saw in a village in the old liberated area on November 12th, the day Shimen was liberated.

　　II. Celebrating Victory

    A few days later, I arrived in a county town. The streets were crowded with people, even more bustling than a large market or temple fair. The roadside was filled with stalls, and militiamen, soldiers, and villagers crowded the roads, coming and going.

    On a memorial archway in the center of the street, lush green pine branches were tied, and a horizontal plaque with red background and gold characters read: "Celebrating Victory." On both sides were a pair of couplets that read: "At Qingfengdian, Chiang's bandit Luo Lirong was completely annihilated and captured," "At Shimen City, the stubborn puppet Liu Ying was swept away and captured." All the shops on the street wrote various celebratory couplets on red paper, even more festive than the New Year. The shopkeepers and staff stood smiling at the door, welcoming the victorious soldiers and militiamen.

    I bought a pound of steamed buns from a peddler pushing a wheelbarrow. For 5,000 yuan, he gave me 3,200 yuan back. It was clearly 2,500 yuan a pound. I asked him strangely, "Did you give me the wrong change?" The bun seller smiled and said to me, "A big price cut to support the army after a victory!" Looking carefully, other shops also had advertisements for price cuts to support the army.

    "Dong dong qiang qiang," the sound of gongs and drums came from afar. Before long, a team of people walked over. The pedestrians on the street immediately stepped aside. Looking closer, the front of the team carried a plaque with the words "Celebrating Victory" written on it. Behind them were primary school students in costumes, each with a bright red painted face and dressed in colorful clothes, dazzling to the eye! Behind them were a group of young women, all wearing new floral print clothes for going out and celebrating the New Year, each holding a bag of supplies for the soldiers. I asked the old man next to me, "Uncle, what are they doing?" The old man looked at me and answered straightforwardly, "They are from the west gate, comforting our troops. Didn't you see the front of the team? It's much bigger than this one. Our troops have won a victory at the front, and people are so happy they don't know what to do. There will be a play tonight, you should stay here and watch it, comrade!"

　　III. On the Roadside

    On a wide highway, groups of villagers were working hard to repair the road, one pickaxe at a time, without even looking up. To block the enemy, the villagers had personally destroyed it. Now that Shimen was liberated, the villagers were personally repairing the roads that were covered with grass or uneven.

    I walked up to the villagers repairing the road and greeted them from afar, "You're working hard, folks!" An old man with a grizzled beard looked up, wiping the sweat from his head, and said, "This is nothing! Now that those returning corps aren't coming back, we feel so much more relieved and peaceful." "In the past, those returning corps robbed during the wheat season and during the autumn harvest. They used large sacks as tall as a person and carried away the grain. They even took all the cotton batting." A young man hadn't finished speaking when another person chimed in, "There was nothing they didn't want. Even after they took things, they smashed your pots and pans and destroyed your doors and windows. In those days, the common people would run away as soon as they heard gunfire. Now that Shimen is liberated, we're not afraid of gunfire anymore..."

    When crossing a bridge, a child of about ten years old stopped a large cart and said, "Don't pass this way. It was just repaired. Our trucks are still going to be driving through here!"

    The militiamen and stretcher bearers returning to the rear all stood tall with spirited expressions. When asked where they were from, they all said in unison, "Shimen!" Their voices were loud and clear.

    Two people were walking behind the militiamen, wearing green military uniforms on the inside and tattered quilts on the outside. Their worn-out shoes dragged along, and they wore no socks, shrinking their bodies, looking like a pair of opium addicts. I asked them, "Where are you from?" A tall man said, shivering, "32nd Division, we were liberated in Shimen. They gave us travel expenses and told us to go home." As he spoke, he took out his pass for me to see. It turned out that his hometown was also in the liberated area. So, I comforted him and said, "Okay, go home, there will be food to eat when you get back."

　　IV. Entering Shimen

    Just as I entered the inner city moat, American-made Chiang planes were circling "buzzing" in the sky. I didn't want to find a place to hide. I just heard someone shouting from afar, "Comrade, come over here and hide!" I looked and saw a head poking out from under the bridge. It was a middle-aged man dressed like a worker. I walked over and saw four or five people inside, an old man with a gray beard, looking at the planes in the sky while pulling at me, "Hide here!" He seemed to have a lot of experience and knew where the planes were flying and how they were dropping bombs.

    The plane flew a little further away, and the middle-aged worker angrily cursed, "I say, damn them, they eat the people's food and drink the people's water, and they use bombs to bomb the people. That son of a bitch Chiang Kai-shek doesn't do a single good thing." The old man said, "Alas, they can't beat the Eighth Route Army, so they take their anger out on us!" I asked the old man, "How were the Kuomintang here?" Everyone rushed to say, "Worse than the Japanese. Anyway, there wasn't a single pair of intact shoes left. The officials took them to be concubines, one after another, driving cars all over the streets, wearing gold rings and leather coats, so extravagant!" "When someone like me set up a small stall, one wrong look and they would kick the stall over, yelling that you were 'setting up too far out.' Who dared to provoke them!" "The Kuomintang officials said that this brick was a stone. Even if you knew it wasn't a stone, you had to say it was a stone." One person said one thing, another said another, and the more they talked, the more excited they became. I was listening so intently. The plane "buzzed" and flew north, going far away. As I walked out, I could still hear them continuing to discuss: "Now it's good, the Eighth Route Army is here, and we poor people should be in charge!"

　　由老解放区到石门
    陈森
    一、捷报传来
    太阳在头顶上照得暖煦煦的，忽听村里的钟声“当当”响，人们立刻放下饭碗跑到当街去，小学生们边跑边喊着：“老乡们，石家庄解放了！”人们见了面都传说着：“石门解放了！”时间不大，村南的场院上集满了人，年青小伙子几十人拉着手乐的直蹦，有的高跳起来。一个老汉端着一碗饭，伸出粗大的手和我拉着：“欢喜呀，同志…………”象拜年、道喜一样，再也闭不住他那掉了牙的嘴。白发苍苍的老太太也走过来，两手捧在胸前，见了人连连点头说：“好，好，好，这可好了！”感动的她再也说不出其他的话来。
    学生们抬出大鼓来，铿铿锵锵的敲起来，敲得人们只见张着嘴笑，听不清谁说的什么话，一群男女老幼便都跟在大红旗后面排成一行，扭起秧歌来，天都被欢笑给遮住了。在人群里有人领着喊：“石门解放万岁！”“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！”“共产党万岁！人民解放军万岁！”一个个都高举起拳头，嗓音又响又亮，胜利鼓舞着人们。
    这正是十一月十二日，石门解放的那天，我在一个老解放区的村子里所看到的情景。
　　二、庆祝胜利
    几天以后，我到了一个县城。街上熙熙的人群，比大集市、庙会还热闹，路旁满满的摊贩，道路上的民兵、战士、老乡，一来一往的挤拥着。
    在街正中的一个牌坊上，扎着翠绿的松枝，一幅红地金字横匾写着：“庆祝胜利”，两旁有一付对联写着：“清风店全歼蒋匪罗历戎被俘”，“石门市横扫顽伪刘英贼遭擒”。街上所有的铺子，都用红色的纸写着各式各样的庆祝胜利的对联，比过年还新鲜，掌柜的伙计们都笑眯眯的站在门口，欢迎打胜仗的战士和民兵。
    我在一个推小车的地方买了一斤馒头，五千块钱他找回三千二，明明是二千五一斤，我奇怪的问他：“找错了吧！”卖馒头的笑嘻嘻的向我说：“打胜仗拥军大减价！”仔细看看别的铺子都贴着拥军大减价的广告。
    “咚咚锵锵”老远锣鼓声传过来，不大功夫，走过来一队人，街上的行人立刻都闪在一旁，一看队前面抬了一个匾，上面写着：“庆祝胜利”，后面是小学生化了装，个个抹着鲜红的脸蛋，花红柳绿的衣服，好不耀眼！后面是一伙年青的妇女，身上也都穿着出门、过年的新花布衣服，每人手里提着一个慰问袋。我打听了一下身旁的老汉：“大伯，这干啥的？”老汉看看我，爽快的答道：“西关里慰劳咱们军队的，你没看头队，比这个队大多了，咱们前方打了胜仗，把人们高兴的没办法，今天晚上还唱戏，你在这儿看戏吧，同志！”
　　三、人行道上
    在一条宽敞的大汽车路上，一堆一伙的老乡们你一镐，我一锨的连头也不抬的在紧张的修汽车路。为了阻击敌人，老乡曾亲自把它破坏，现在，石门解放了，老乡们又亲自把长满青草，或高低不平的道路修复起来了。
    我走到修路的老乡跟前，老远打着招呼说：“辛苦了，老乡们！”一个花白胡子的老汉抬起头来，抹下一把头上的汗说道：“这算什么！那些还乡团不来了，心里可宽绰了，安生了”，“过去那些还乡团麦季也抢，秋季也抢，一人高的大口袋两人抬，粮食都抬走了，棉花套子也都抢光了。”一个年青的还未说完，又有一个人接着说：“没有他们不要的物件，要了还不算，锅碗瓢盆都给你砸了，门窗也给你毁了。那些日子老百姓一听枪响早都跑光了，这回石门解放了，枪响也不怕了………”
    过桥时，一个十来岁的小孩子，拦住一辆大车说：“不要打这儿过了，刚修好，咱们的汽车还打这儿进呢！”
    回后方去的民兵、担架队，个个挺着胸脯精神十足。问他们打那来，都异口同声的说：“石门！”声音又高又亮。
    在民兵的后面过来两个人，里边穿着一身绿军装，外边披了一条破被子，一双破鞋拖拉着，没穿袜子，缩着身子，活象一对烟鬼，我问他：“你是那里的？”一个高个子打着哆嗦说：“三十二师，在石门解放过来的，发了路费，叫我们回家的。”说着掏出执照给我看，原来他的老家也在解放区。我便安慰他说：“好了，回家去吧，回去就有饭吃了。”
　　四、进了石门
    刚进了内市沟，美式蒋机在天上“嗡嗡”的盘旋，我不想找地方躲避，只听得老远有人在喊：“同志，快过来躲躲吧！”我一看，在桥底下露出一个头来，是个工人打扮的中年人，我走过去一看，里面有四五个人，一个有灰胡子的老头，一面望着天上的飞机，一面扯着我：“这边躲吧！”他好象很有经验，知道飞机向那飞，怎样投弹。
    飞机转得远一些了，那个中年工人气愤愤的骂道：“我说他娘，吃着老百姓的，喝着老百姓的，还拿炸弹来炸老百姓，他妈的蒋介石孙子不干一点好事。”老头说：“唉，打不过八路军，拿咱老百姓出气呢！”我问那个老头：“国民党在这里怎么样？”大家都抢着说：“比日本还凶，反正破鞋没剩一个，当官的取来当了姨太太，换一个又一个，坐着汽车满街窜哪，金戒指，皮大衣，好阔气！”“象我这样摆小摊的过来，一个不对眼，一脚把摊踢翻了，吆喝人‘摆的往外了’，谁敢惹他们呀！”“国民党当官的说这块砖头是石头，你明知道不是石头也得说是石头。你一言，我一语，越说越起劲，我听得出神。飞机“嗡嗡”飞向北边去，走远了。我走出去还听到他们继续在谈论着：“这回好了，八路军来了，咱们穷人该当家了！”
