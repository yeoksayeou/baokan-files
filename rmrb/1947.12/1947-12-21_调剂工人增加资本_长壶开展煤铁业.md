　　Adjusting Laborers to Increase Capital
  　Changzhi and Huguan Counties Develop Coal and Iron Industries
    [This newspaper, Changzhi dispatch] Changzhi and Huguan counties, with Yincheng as their center, were once famous throughout the country for their coal and iron industries, with sales reaching nineteen provinces. There was a saying, "Thousands of *li* to Pengcheng, ten thousands of *li* to Yincheng," and "Yincheng under Heaven." Before the war, income from coal and iron accounted for more than 60 percent of the total income of the masses, and there was a saying, "A peck of gold earned every day." After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the destruction by the Japanese invaders and the exploitation by puppet and stubborn landlords and local bullies, the coal and iron industries suffered greatly, and a large number of workers lost their jobs and died. After liberation in 1945, with the support of the democratic government, there was some development, but it was still far from the pre-war level. In order to develop winter production with coal and iron as the main industries, the two counties of Huguan and Changzhi jointly held a coal and iron industry research meeting in Yincheng on the 10th of this month. It was determined that the main problems at present are the lack of workers in Changzhi's crucible furnaces, and the common difficulties of both counties in capital and sales. Regarding the worker problem, everyone believed that Huguan should transfer workers to Changzhi, and Changzhi should treat Huguan workers as teachers, overcoming the past discriminatory views of furnace owners towards workers. The capital problem should be mainly solved by the masses contributing labor as shares and absorbing idle funds from the masses, with bank loans making up the shortfall. As for the sales problem, the main problem is poor technology, which does not meet the needs of the masses and the market. It is necessary to promote "blacksmiths retraining as blacksmiths, learning two skills in three days," produce more finished products, and improve technology. Finally, Du, the director of the Lu'an General Cooperative, made a summary, pointing out that the future policy should be based on agriculture (winter production should be based on coal and iron industries), and the coal and iron industries should be regarded as sideline businesses. Agriculture and industry should be combined, and labor and capital should be combined to solve the difficulties of labor and capital shortages. Tools should be improved, technology should be improved, so as to facilitate sales and increase production. A large number of coal kilns should be increased, pig iron production should be increased, and large and small crucible furnaces should be restored and developed. With the spirit of training weavers in the past, a large number of crucible furnace, bar furnace, and stir-frying furnace workers should be trained. Finally, it was decided to lend 8 million yuan (Huguan received 3.5 million yuan), and Huguan transferred 40 workers to Changzhi, solving the specific difficulties of capital and workers. According to the actual situation, Changzhi and Huguan counties have formulated plans for development this winter. Huguan will develop from the current 146 various furnaces to 166, and build a new stir-frying furnace. By the end of the lunar year, it will produce more than 790,000 catties of pig iron, which will be sold in addition to self-use. Changzhi Fourth District's finished product furnaces will be restored to the 402 furnaces before July, and 30 new crucible furnaces will be developed. (Su Li, Ben Shan, Man Gui, Ju Jin, Li Feng)

　　调剂工人增加资本
  　长壶开展煤铁业
    【本报长治讯】以荫城为聚处的长治壶关煤、铁业，曾驰名全国，销路遍及十九省，有“千里彭城万里荫城”“天下荫城”的说法，战前收入占群众总收入的百分之六十以上，有“日进斗金”之谚。抗战开始，由于日寇的摧残及伪顽地主恶霸的盘剥，煤、铁业大受摧残，工人大批失业死亡。四五年解放以后，在民主政府的扶持下，虽少有发展，比之战前尚相差很远。为开展以煤、铁业为主的冬季生产，本月十日，壶、长两县共同在荫城召开了煤铁业研究会，研究出当前主要问题是长治方炉工人缺乏，及两县共同存在的资本、销路困难。关于工人问题大家认为壶关应向长治调剂，长治对壶关工人应以老师看待，克服过去炉主对工人的歧视观点。资金问题应以群众劳力入股和吸收群众游资为主，不足者由银行贷款。至于销路问题，主要是技术差，不合群众和市场需要，应提倡“铁匠改铁匠，三天两后晌”，多打熟货，把技术提高一步。最后潞安总社杜社长作总结，指出今后方针应以农业为主（冬季生产应以煤、铁业为主），把煤、铁业看成副业来经营，农工业应结合起来，劳力和资金结合起来，解决劳力和资金缺乏的困难，改良工具，提高技术，以利推销和增加产量。大量增加煤窑、增加生铁、恢复和发展大小方炉，拿已往训练织妇的精神，大量训练方炉、条炉、炒炉工人。最后决定贷款八百万元（壶关得三百五十万），壶关给长治调剂工人四十名，解决了资金和工人的具体困难。长、壶两县根据实际情况，定出了今冬发展的计划，壶关由现在的一百四十六座各种炉，发展到一百六十六座，新开炒炉一座，到阴历年底出生铁七十九万余斤，除自用还出卖。长治四区成货炉恢复到七月前的四百零两座，新发展方炉三十座。　（苏里、本善、满贵、聚金、立峰）
