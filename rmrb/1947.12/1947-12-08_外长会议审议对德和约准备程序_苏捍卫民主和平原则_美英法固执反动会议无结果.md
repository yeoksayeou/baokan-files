Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 5th: A comprehensive dispatch from TASS, London: On November 29th and December 1st, the four foreign ministers' meeting began reviewing the procedures for preparing the German peace treaty. Fierce debates arose during the meeting. The Soviet Union steadfastly fought to defend the democratic and peaceful principles of the Potsdam and Yalta agreements. The imperialist group, led by the United States, stubbornly adhered to its imperialist "peace" line. The main issues discussed at the meeting were as follows: (1) Which countries should the foreign ministers consult when preparing the German peace treaty? The Soviet delegation, based on the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference (note: the Foreign Ministers' Conference should consult with Germany's neighboring countries and countries that fought against Germany with their armies), requested that Albania, which had fought against Germany with all its strength, participate. France agreed, but the U.S. and Britain unreasonably opposed it, resulting in no agreement on this issue. However, Pakistan was allowed to participate in the consultation of the German peace treaty with the consent of the four countries. (2) The timing of the peace conference. Molotov firmly insisted that the peace conference should be convened after the establishment of a German central government that is suitable for accepting the treaty, and that representatives of the German government should be allowed to state their opinions. Therefore, the organization of a democratic central government in Germany should not be delayed any longer. Marshall stubbornly opposed this just proposition, attempting to indefinitely delay and abandon the organization of a German central government in order to achieve his conspiracy to split Germany. British Foreign Secretary Bevin went back on his word, initially agreeing with the Soviet principle, but immediately turned to follow the U.S. when he saw Marshall's displeasure. France fully echoed the U.S. opinion, so this issue remained unresolved. (3) The relationship between the peace treaty and the German constitution. The U.S. attempted to create a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of a democratic Germany in the future. Therefore, it advocated that the exercise of power of the German constitution should be conditional on compliance with and consistency with the peace treaty jointly agreed upon by the Allied powers. Molotov strongly criticized this suggestion, stating that it would allow the German constitution to be forcibly amended under the so-called "distrust" of any controlling country. He said, "This is an anti-democratic policy that treats Germany as a colony and will arouse the revengeful sentiments of the German people and affect peace." Molotov also said, "It is unacceptable and doomed to failure to make the survival of the German constitution dependent on the appetite of the victorious countries." Bevin and Bidault echoed the U.S. opinion, but because they lacked reason and their arguments were weak, they could not refute Molotov's proposition, and this issue also yielded no results.

　　外长会议审议对德和约准备程序
    苏捍卫民主和平原则
    美英法固执反动会议无结果
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合塔斯社伦敦讯：上月二十九日及本月一日，四外长会议开始审议对德和约准备程序。会上引起了激烈的争辩，苏联坚决为捍卫波茨顿与雅尔塔协议的民主和平原则而奋斗不懈，以美国为首的帝国主义集团则固执着帝国主义的“和平”路线。会上主要讨论了如下几个问题：（一）准备对德和约时，外长会议应与那些国家进行谘商？苏联代表团根据莫斯科外长会议的决定（按：即外长会议应与德国邻国及曾以其军队共同对德作战的国家进行谘商对德和约），要求曾以全力对德作战之阿尔巴尼亚参加，法国表示同意，美英则无理地横加反对，致使会议对此问题未获协议。但巴基斯坦则在四国同意下得以参加对德和约之谘商。（二）召开和会时间问题，莫洛托夫坚决主张应在合于接受和约的德国中央政府成立以后召开和会，且允许德政府的代表有申述意见之机会。因此，建立德国民主的中央政府的组织不容再缓。马歇尔顽固反对这一正义主张，妄图无限期拖延和放弃组织德国中央政府，以便达成其分裂德国之阴谋。英国贝文则出尔反尔，最初同意苏联的原则，后来看到马歇尔表示不愉快，因此立即转而尾随美国。法国则完全附和美国意见，因此这一问题仍一无结果。（三）和约与德国宪法之关系问题，美国企图造成一种藉口，以便来日干涉民主德国的内政。因此主张德国宪法的行使权力，应以遵守盟国共同同意的和约及与和约一致为条件。莫洛托夫力斥此种建议将使德国宪法在任何一个管制国的所谓“不信任”之下就可被迫修改。他说：“这是一种反民主的政策，是把德国看做殖民地，会引起德国人民的复仇情绪而影响和平。”莫氏并称：“要使德国宪法的生存依赖于胜利国的胃口，是不容许的，也是注定要失败的。”贝文、比道尔虽附和美国意见，但因理曲词穷，也无法反驳莫洛托夫的主张，该项问题又未获任何结果。
