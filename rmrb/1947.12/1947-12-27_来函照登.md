To the Editor of Letters to the Editor:
    The report in your newspaper on the 4th of this month regarding the recapture of Caiyuan in Tangyin was based on a telephone message received by the Tangyin County Headquarters from the "Wuchang" unit on November 16th. According to current investigations, Caiyuan has not been recaptured. What was recaptured was Gucheng, near Caiyuan. Please make a correction.

　　来函照登编辑同志：
    贵报本月四日登载之汤阴收复菜园，系汤阴县指挥部于十一月十六日接“武昌”部电话消息。据现在查明，菜园并未收复，系收复菜园附近之固城，请予更正。
