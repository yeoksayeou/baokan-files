　　Qinwen Masses Collect Cotton Clothes to Aid Refugees in Jiao, Xiu, and Other Places
    [Report from this newspaper in Qinyang] After the Qin Yang Second District government proposed mobilizing clothes to aid refugees displaced from Jiao, Xiu, and other places, as well as disaster-stricken masses in border areas, the masses in various villages actively donated. Originally, the district called for mobilizing 200 items, but each village exceeded its assigned task in self-reporting. For example, Xiwancun originally reported 15 items, but completed 55; Xiaoweiying originally reported 15 items, completed 22; Penyao originally reported 15 items, completed 17; and Wanshan Village originally reported 10 items, completed 14. Some masses brought out lined clothes, and some said, "Lined clothes cannot be used as cotton clothes; we still need to mobilize some cotton." The masses in Xiwancun, Penyao, and other villages all said, "Farmers all over the world are one family. We are living securely at home wearing cotton clothes, so we must also let the refugees wear cotton clothes." They put forward the slogan: "Mobilize one more item, and one less refugee will suffer from the cold." In some villages, the masses donated cotton clothes on the spot at one meeting. This enthusiastic spirit truly demonstrates the class love among the peasants in the liberated areas. In addition, more than 800 cotton clothes have been collected in Wen County and other places.

　　沁温群众募集棉衣救济焦修等地难胞
    【本报沁阳讯】沁阳二区各村群众，自区上提出动员衣服，救济焦、修等地转移出难民及边地被灾群众号召后，各村踊跃捐输，原来区上号召动员二百件，但各村在自报下都超过了任务。如西万村原报十五件，结果完成了五十五件；校尉营原报十五件，完成廿二件；盆窑原报十五件，完成十七件；万善村原报十件，完成十四件。有的群众拿出是袷衣，有的说：“袷衣不能当棉衣，还得动员些棉花。”西万、盆窑等村群众都说：“天下农民是一家，咱们安稳在家穿棉衣，也得叫难胞们穿上棉衣。”他们提出口号：“多动员一件，少一个难民受冷。”有的村在一个会上，就有群众当场把棉衣捐出。热烈精神，真正表现了解放区农民间的阶级友爱。另外温县等地现已募到棉衣八百余件。（志鹏）
