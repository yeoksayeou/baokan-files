　　Utilizing Local Advantages: Shahe Develops Small Coal Mines
    [Reported by our newspaper from Shahe] Under the call for increasing production to overcome the famine and fill the financial gaps, the masses in Xixiahe, Wenjiazhuang, Yaopo, Sanwangcun, Xincheng and other villages in the second, third, and fourth districts have recognized the severity of the disaster. They have brought into play the production experience of "doing whatever is available and doing whatever one knows how to do." Utilizing the local advantage of coal production, they have organized the skilled coal miners in their villages to launch a small coal mine movement. This movement has now achieved significant results. There are already seven small coal mines in production, two are under development, and one is planned for development. Among the seven small coal mines in production, three are run by the masses themselves, two are borrowing public coal shafts for extraction, and two are renting public abandoned small coal mines for extraction. In Xiande Wang Village, Fourth District, a discontinued small coal mine of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region was rented on the 15th day of the ninth lunar month (15 baskets out of every 100 baskets produced are given as rent). Currently, there are 70 workers, producing 100 baskets of coal per day. This coal mine is rented by the masses through mutual aid, with everyone eating from the same pot and settling accounts every half month. The wages are 700 yuan for a short evening shift and 400 yuan for a daytime shift. The seven small coal mines in production employ 500 workers, producing nearly 1,000 baskets of coal per day (each basket weighing 70 old catties). After deducting all expenses, a profit of 200,000 yuan can be made. Wages in rice range from 10 catties at the highest to 7 catties at the lowest. In addition to the workers' own consumption, they can generally support two to three family members. In this way, the livelihood problems of over a thousand people have been solved. It is often said that coal is produced in winter and spring. Small coal mines will have even greater development in the winter and spring seasons. They will play a certain role in the masses' production and disaster relief efforts in this area. (Dehua)

　　运用当地有利条件沙河发展小煤窑
    【本报沙河讯】在生产渡荒填窟窿号召下，二、三、四区西下河、温家庄、窑坡、三王村、新城等村群众，认识了灾荒严重，发挥了“有啥做啥，会啥干啥”的生产经验，运用了当地产煤的有利条件，将自己村的熟练煤工组织起来，开展小煤窑运动。这一运动现已收到显著成绩，出煤小窑已有七个，正在开采中两个，设计开采的一个。在产煤的七个小窑中，有群众自己办理的三个，借用公家煤筒抽煤的两个，租用公家停工小窑出煤的两个。四区显德汪村在阴历九月十五日，租借冀鲁豫军区一停工小窑（出产后一百筐抽十五筐）现已产煤，有工人七十名，每天出煤一百筐，这煤窑是群众互助租的，吃大锅饭，半月一结帐。工资一短班晚工赚七百元，白天赚四百元。出煤的七个小窑，有工人五百个，每日产煤近千筐（每筐老秤七十斤），除一切消耗外，可赚钱二十万元。工资米高至十斤低至七斤，除工人自用外，一般还可顾家中两口至三口人生活。这样即把千余人生活问题解决了。常说：煤产在冬春。小煤窑在冬春两季是会有更大的发展的。它在这一带群众生产渡荒上，将要起到一定的作用。（德华）
