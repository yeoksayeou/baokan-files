Fengfeng Mining District Promotes the "Three Ones" Movement
Educates Workers to Establish Households
[This Newspaper's Dispatch] During the study sessions in Fengfeng Mining District, some workers reflected: Farmers have been distributed land, houses, and farming tools, but workers have neither houses nor land. If they don't work in the mine for a few days, they face difficulties (mainly referring to some workers from other areas who have no land or houses, and live in the mining area relying on wages for a long time). According to the actual thoughts of the workers, the Trade Union Federation convened a meeting of cadres from various production units on December 5th, explaining that the workers' wages were not low, but they couldn't save money, mainly because the workers didn't plan for the long term in their lives. For example, Fuli Kiln's Suo He spends 10,000 yuan per month on food at the kiln, and 11,000 yuan per month on cigarettes, alcohol, sesame cakes, and malt sugar. Although this phenomenon is a minority, it should be noted. It should be recognized that this is a bad habit left over from the past ruling capitalist class in order to exploit workers more. Today, it should be thoroughly overcome. In order to truly help workers establish households in thought and action, each branch union should conduct in-depth ideological education, requiring the launch next spring of a "Three Ones" movement: each able-bodied worker having a hoe (at least to solve the family's vegetable problem), each family having a spinning wheel, and each worker investing 10,000 yuan in the cooperative. Credit departments should also be established in the cooperatives of each unit to absorb workers' temporary funds and reward workers' savings.

    [Another Dispatch] According to Wei Haoli, the principal of the Tai'an Village Mining School in Fengfeng Mining District, since the school started wasteland reclamation on July 25th this year, until last month's summary, 71 students of all ages participated in production, with 28 regularly participating. They harvested Chinese cabbage, red and white radishes, small vegetable roots, buckwheat, and swept up coal, totaling more than 400,000 yuan in value. This solved part of the school's public miscellaneous expenses and the students' families' vegetable problems. Next year, they will strive for the school to be self-sufficient, in order to reduce the burden on the village's workers.    (You Wen)

    峰峰矿区提倡“三一”运动
    教育工友建立家务
    【本报讯】峰峰矿区在学习中，部分工人反映：农民分了土地、房屋和农具，工人一无房子二无土地，几天不下窑生活就发生困难（主要是一部分无房无地、长期在矿区住的依靠工资生活的外区工人）。职工总会根据工友的思想实际，于十二月五日，召开了各生产单位的干部会议，说明工人工资并不低，但存不下钱，主要是工友生活上不作长期打算。如福利窑索和的，他本人每月在窑上伙食一万元，每月他买纸烟、喝酒、吃烧饼、麻糖就化一万一千元，虽然这种现象是少数的，也应引起注意，认识这是过去统治阶级资本家为了更多剥削工友所留下的坏习气，今天应彻底克服，为了在思想上、和行动上真正帮助工友建立家务，各分工会应进行深入的思想教育，要求明春开展每个全劳力工友每人一把镢头（最低解决家庭吃菜问题）、每家一轮纺花车、每个工人在合作社入股一万元的“三一”运动，并在各单位合作社设立信用部，吸收工人临时性资金，奖励工人积蓄。

    【又讯】据峰峰矿区太安村矿校魏好礼校长谈，该校自今年七月二十五日开始开荒生产，至上月总结，全校参加生产大小学生七十一人，经常生产的廿八人，计收白菜、红白萝卜、小菜根、荞麦等及扫炭等生产，共合洋四十万余元。解决了部分学校公杂费开支及学生家庭吃菜问题，明年争取学校自给，以减轻该村职工负担。    （幼汶）
