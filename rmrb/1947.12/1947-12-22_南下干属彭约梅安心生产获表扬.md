　　Dependents of Southbound Cadre Peng Yuemei Praised for Peace of Mind in Production
　　[This newspaper’s report] Peng Yuemei, a woman working in the Supply Department of the Military Region's No. 1 Clothing Factory, has been working even harder since her husband followed the army south. In July, she sewed 900 buttonholes (without buttons), in August she sewed 1,000, and in September she worked even harder and sewed 1,300, earning 918 catties of millet in three months. Now she works overtime every night. Comrade Tian Qilian, the women's team leader, asked her: "Why are you working so hard in production?" Comrade Peng Yuemei replied: "First, it's for our livelihood, second, it's to provide for my children's schooling, and third, it's to allow my husband to work with peace of mind at the front, without worrying about our food and expenses." This comrade actively participates in labor and is self-sufficient, earning the praise of all the factory workers. She was selected as a women's model in the summary of cotton clothing production, and the factory awarded her prizes such as towels and notebooks as encouragement. (Ge Qin)

　　南下干属彭约梅安心生产获表扬
    【本报讯】军区被服一厂供给部妇女彭约梅，她丈夫随军南下之后，她的工作更加紧张。七月份锁扣眼（不订扣）九百件，八月份锁到一千件，九月份更努力锁到一千三百件，三个月赚到九百一十八斤小米。现在天天晚上打夜工。妇女队长田启莲同志问她：“你为啥要这样紧张的生产？”彭约梅同志答道：“一是为俺的生活，二是为供给俺小孩上学，三是为叫俺男人在前方安心工作，不结计俺的吃喝。”该同志积极劳动，生活自给，得到全厂职工的赞扬，总结棉衣中被选为妇女模范，厂部发给毛巾、日记本等奖品，以资鼓励。　　（葛钦）
