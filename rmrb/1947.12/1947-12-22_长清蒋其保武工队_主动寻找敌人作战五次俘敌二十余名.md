(Jilu Yu News Agency, 20th) The Jiang Qibao Armed Work Team of Changqing County, Taixi Sub-district, has gradually grown and strengthened in the long-term struggle. Before the enemy's large army pressed in, everyone, with the unanimous idea of "resolutely not leaving the masses in the Eighth District," collectively swore: "We will live and die with the masses in the Eighth District and vow never to leave the Eighth District..." Soon the enemy occupied Changqing, and this armed work team was distributed in various parts of the Eighth District. Comrade Qibao led two people to start living in mountain caves. Although the enemy constantly searched the mountains, Comrade Qibao always adhered to his post. They often appeared in various villages to suppress bad elements. They killed twenty-three bad guys in two days. The drowning dogs who tried to take the opportunity to move were quickly suppressed, and the masses' fighting spirit was gradually improved and consolidated. This armed work team often took the initiative to fight the enemy. One day, after obtaining accurate information about the enemy's movements, Comrade Qibao led five team members down the mountain and ambushed in the enemy ranks. With flexible, rapid, and brave actions, they captured seventeen enemy telephone operators alive. By the time the enemy's main force discovered them, they had already returned to the mountains. Two days later, Qibao and two others disguised themselves and put on American military uniforms. Without firing a shot, they captured three enemy intelligence officers. This armed work team fought five battles, capturing more than twenty enemies and killing or wounding seventeen enemies. As a result, small groups of enemies did not dare to easily invade our central area. Due to the continuous victories of the armed work team, the militia in the Eighth District also became active. One day, the enemy's "Security Regiment Seventeen" dispatched a company to the Malingzhuang area to seize grain. The militia began to shoot in all directions, and the enemy thought there were guerrillas all over the mountains, so they fled in panic. The militia, in cooperation with the masses, chased the enemy for several miles. Later, the enemy dispatched three times to seize grain, but were all repelled by our armed work team.

　　长清蒋其保武工队
  　主动寻找敌人作战五次俘敌二十余名
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】泰西分区长清县蒋其保武工队，在长期斗争中，逐渐提高壮大。在敌大军压境前，大家在“坚决不离开八区群众”的一致思想下，集体宣誓：“与八区群众同生死共患难，誓死不脱离八区………”不久敌人侵占了长清，这支武工队便分布在八区各个地方，其保同志带领二人开始山洞生活。虽然敌人不断搜山，其保同志始终坚持了自己的岗位。他们经常出现在各个村庄，镇压坏分子。他们在二天当中杀掉二十三个坏蛋，企图趁机活动的落水狗很快即被压下去，群众斗争情绪逐渐提高与巩固。这支武工队经常主动找敌人作战，一天得到敌行动的确息后，其保同志便带领五个队员下山，设伏在敌军行列中，以机动灵活迅速勇敢的动作，活捉了十七个敌电话员，待敌主力发觉时，他们已返到山上去了。事后两天，其保等三个人化上装，穿上美式军装，一枪未发，捉到三个敌谍报员。这支武工队五次战斗，俘敌二十余名，毙伤敌十七名，因此小股敌人便不敢轻易进犯我中心区了。由于武工队的连战连捷，八区民兵也活跃起来了。一天敌“保安十七团”出动，一个连到马岭庄一带抢粮，民兵便开始四面打枪，敌认为满山有游击队，便慌忙逃窜。民兵协同群众一直追敌数里。以后敌三次出动抢粮，均被我武工队击退。
