　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS, New York - Approximately 75 American labor unions and other democratic groups have launched a movement to support Indonesian independence and have formed the "Committee to Support Indonesian Independence" as the central organization to carry out this movement. The committee met on the 8th and resolved to demand that the Security Council take urgent and effective measures to order the Dutch and Indonesian armies to withdraw to pre-war positions. It also called on labor unions to support the National Maritime Union's decision to boycott Dutch ships carrying munitions. In its statement, the committee opposed the policy of American imperialism in supporting the Netherlands in restoring colonial rule. It demanded that the United States immediately stop military, political, and economic aid to the Netherlands and urged the United States to recognize the Republic of Indonesia.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Reports from various sources: The movement to support Indonesia in Australia, Malaya, and other places continues to develop. Australian workers recently boycotted handling materials for Dutch ships bound for Indonesia. Wharf workers in Sydney refused to load the Dutch ship "Hindustan" on the 25th of last month. The dockworkers discovered that the goods on the ship originally had Surabaya and Batavia markings, which were later painted over with Hong Kong markings, and that the goods were being shipped to Indonesia for use in the war of aggression. According to the "Indonesia Guide" in Batavia on the 1st, the Malayan Democratic Youth Association has announced a boycott of Dutch ships docking in Singapore. The association called on all dockworkers to boycott Dutch ships carrying war materials and troops to Indonesia.

    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方讯：澳洲马来亚等地的声援印尼运动继续开展。澳洲工人于最近曾抵制为荷兰轮船搬运物资起赴印尼。悉尼码头工人于上月二十五日已拒绝替荷轮“印度斯坦号”装货。因码头工人发现该轮货物原先盖有泗水及巴达维亚标志，后被涂改为香港标志，而该项货物系运往印尼，用于侵略战争者。另据一日巴城“印尼导报”载称：马来亚民主青年协会已宣布抵制荷兰船只在新加坡停泊。该协会号召所有码头工人，对载运战争物资及军队赴印尼之荷轮，施行抵制。
