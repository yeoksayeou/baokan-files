    [This Dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu Region, 19th] The Yellow River is about to freeze over. After the freeze, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops may cross the river to plunder and harass residents on the west bank of the river. For this reason, the people along the river strongly demand the strengthening of winter river defenses. In just ten days, 1,200 young and strong people have joined the river defense brigade.
