Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Tokyo News: The labor unrest in Japan continues to develop. On the 18th, 200,000 workers from fifteen labor groups participated in a mass rally in the Imperial Palace Plaza, which was filled with red flags. The participating masses denounced the Katayama Cabinet for creating the Japanese economic crisis and further worsening the lives of workers. The大会 passed a resolution calling on workers across the country to "produce for the workers themselves." The resolution pointed out that since Katayama took office, Japan's economic situation has deteriorated, and workers are demanding that the government change its attitude towards the recently striking civil servants. After the meeting, 200,000 workers marched to the Prime Minister's residence, the parliament, the Supreme Court, and other places, braving the severe cold of the first snow, shouting, "We demand the minimum right to survival."
