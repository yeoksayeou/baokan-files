[This article was transmitted from the Jiluyu Branch Office on the 29th.] To dispel the ideological concerns of district and village cadres and ignite mass enthusiasm for joining the army, the Boping County Committee successively convened a joint meeting of district sub-committees and a conference of over three thousand district and village cadres on the 11th and 12th of this month. This clarified the direction of enlistment work and laid a solid foundation for the victorious mass conscription movement in the county. Initially, district cadres lacked sufficient confidence in the enlistment work, fearing that superiors would impose deadlines and numerical quotas, and fearing that the masses would have unresolved issues, so their enthusiasm for enlistment was not high. Village cadres feared that middle peasants would squeeze out poor peasants, and the masses would squeeze out village cadres, and that they would have to take the lead. Most district and village cadres lacked a deep understanding of the mass line in enlistment work, thinking that "it is easy to talk about, but confusing to execute!" They believed that it was "really difficult to achieve complete voluntariness" in the movement, and that "you (the masses) have fixed rules - not to participate," lacking sufficient understanding of the political consciousness of the emancipated masses, and showing timidity in deeply mobilizing the masses' ideological consciousness. At these two conferences, the leadership first conveyed the new spirit of the enlistment work, dispelling the ideological concerns of the cadres, explicitly announcing that there would be no time limits, no fixed numerical quotas, and no emphasis on cadres taking the lead. It was pointed out that enlistment was the demand of the masses, and they must be allowed to handle it themselves, opposing coercive orders from the leadership. Starting from the current demands of the masses, resolving the obstacles to enlistment, and combining enlistment with the brewing and mobilization of the masses' ideological consciousness, the cadres at all levels were called upon to boldly unleash democracy, implement the mass line in enlistment work, and create a mass movement of truly conscious and voluntary enlistment. After several days of repeated brewing and discussion, the cadres present realized that the mass line was a matter of ideology, not a matter of method, and realized that only by resolutely following the mass line would a large number of activists emerge. In the discussion, Commissioner Guo further enlightened the cadres, enabling them to realize that the concrete application of the mass line in the conscription movement involved deeply mobilizing the masses, resolving their issues, brewing conscription, cultivating "conscription seedlings," and then, when the brewing was ripe, leading by advanced masses at the farmers' congress, with everyone voluntarily signing up. This was the general ideological mobilization process for forming a conscription upsurge. After gaining a clear understanding of the enlistment movement, the cadres present had increased confidence. Finally, the village cadres of Mizhuang in the Third District said at the conference: "After we go back, we will first convene a mass meeting, let the common people clarify the bottom line, knowing that enlistment is not forced, put down their burdens, and then talk about why they want to enlist. Enlistment is their own business, clear their minds. If the masses still don't say anything, we will convene a village cadre meeting to examine our (referring to the village cadres) mistakes, and then insert ourselves into the masses to see what the reasons are, where the problems lie, resolve the problems where there are problems, and solve the difficulties where there are difficulties."
    [This article was transmitted from the Jiluyu Branch Office on the 29th.] After sufficient brewing and discussion, the Fifth District of Nanle has witnessed many exemplary deeds of sending sons and husbands to join the army. On the 13th, the first, second, and third sub-districts jointly convened a mass meeting in Dongsizhuang, Hedong, with over ten thousand men and women attending. At the beginning of the meeting, brewing and discussion were conducted by village units. After the village activities, activities were immediately carried out by sub-district units. In the sub-district activities, representatives from each village reported on their village's work, how to get the masses to discuss, and how to inspire the masses to consciously and voluntarily enlist. The forty-one villages followed roughly the same path: first holding a cadre meeting, then a mass meeting, and then meetings of mass organizations such as the peasant association, women's association, militia, and self-defense force, combined with family meetings. The various meetings improved the thinking of men, women, old and young, realizing that enlisting to fight Chiang Kai-shek was their own business, and achieving conscious and voluntary enlistment, following the mass line. In the sub-district activities, models from each village described their own model moving deeds of voluntarily enlisting and voluntarily sending their sons and husbands to join the army at the meeting. An old poor peasant woman, fifty years old, from Dongsizhuang said: "In order to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and live a good life, this time I will definitely send my son to join the army." Several women from Fushan Village immediately stood up and expressed their determination to send their sons to join the army. On the 14th, at a mass meeting of more than three thousand people in the fourth and fifth sub-districts, the masses of Qianfo Village eagerly expressed: "If you have a share in the land distribution, you also have a share in fighting Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely voluntarily join the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek." The representative of Shaozhuang reported to everyone: "Thirty people in the village have already voluntarily joined the army." And the most eye-catching was Shi Lianhua, the enlistment representative from Wucun. When he took the stage to speak, he said: "On behalf of our thirty-eight enlistees, I would like to express our attitude to everyone. We are all consciously and voluntarily joining the army. We will not go home until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown."

　　博平三千区村干部集会
  　明确参军必须自愿
    南乐五区青壮踊跃自觉报名
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】为解除区村干部思想顾虑，掀起群众参军热潮，博平县委会先后于本月十一日及十二日，召开了区分委联席会议与三千余人的区村干部大会，明确了参军工作的道路，打下该县群众性参军运动的胜利基础。开始的时候，区干部对这次参军工作缺乏足够信心，害怕上级限定时间要数目字，害怕群众有些疙瘩解不开，参军劲头不大；村干则害怕中农挤贫农、群众挤村干、害怕带头。对参军工作中的群众路线，多数区村干部均缺乏深刻认识，以为“说倒好说，执行起来就糊涂啦！”认为在运动中“完全达到自觉自愿实在困难”，“你有千条妙法，他（群众）有一定之规——不参”，对翻身群众的政治觉悟认识不够，对深入发动群众的思想自觉表现畏缩。在这两次大会上，领导上首先传达了此次参军工作的新精神，解除了干部的思想顾虑，明确宣布不限时间、不要固定数目字、不强调干部带头，并指出参军是群众的要求，一定要让群众自己办，反对领导上的强迫命令，要从群众当前要求出发，解决参军中的阻碍，结合参军，酝酿发动群众的思想自觉，号召各级干部，大胆放手民主，贯彻参军工作中的群众路线，造成群众性的真正自觉自愿的参军运动。继经数日反复酝酿讨论，到会干部认识了群众路线是思想问题，不是方法问题，认识到只有坚决走群众路线，就一定会涌现出大批积极分子。在讨论中，复经郭专员进行启发，使到会干部认识群众路线具体运用到参军运动中，乃是由深入发动群众，经群众解疙瘩，酝酿参军，培养“参军苗”，到酝酿成熟，在农民大会上由先进群众带头，大家自愿报名，这便是形成参军热潮的一般思想发动过程。对此次参军运动，作了明确认识后，到会干部信心倍增。最后，三区米庄的村干在大会上说：“俺回去后，先召开群众大会，叫老百姓澄澄底，知道了参军不强迫，放下包袱，再谈为什么参军，参军是自己的事，打通思想，如果群众再不吭气，就召开村干会检讨，检讨咱们（指村干）的错误，然后再插到群众中去，看看有那些原因，疙瘩在那里，有疙瘩解疙瘩，有困难解决困难。”
    【本报冀鲁豫廿九日电】南乐五区经过了充分的酝酿讨论，出现了许多送子送夫参军的模范事迹。十三日，一、二、三小区在河东东寺庄合并召开群众大会，到会男女达万余人，会议开始首先以村为单位酝酿讨论。村的活动后，紧接着又以小区为单位的活动。在小区的活动中，每个村的代表汇报自己村里的工作，如何叫群众讨论，如何启发群众自觉自愿的参军，四十一个村庄，都走着差不多相同的道路：首先开干部会，再开群众会，群众团体里农会、妇会、民兵、自卫队再开会，结合着开家庭会。各种会议中，使男女老幼的思想提高一步，认识参军打老蒋是自己的事，做到自觉自愿的参军，走了群众路线。在小区的活动中，每个村的模范都在会议上述说自己自愿参军与自愿送子送夫的模范动人事迹。东寺庄一个五十岁的贫农老大娘说：“为了打倒老蒋过好日子，这回我一定送我的儿参军。”佛善村的妇女当场就有六、七个站起来表示自己送子参军的决心。十四日，四、五小区三千多人的群众大会上，千佛村的群众争先表示：“分土地上有一份，打老蒋也有一份，坚决自愿参军打老蒋。”邵庄的代表向大家汇报：“村里已有三十名自愿参军。”而最引人注目的是吴村的参军代表史莲花，他上台讲话时说：“我代表俺三十八位参军人向大家表表态度，我们都是自觉自愿参军的，不打倒老蒋不回家。”
