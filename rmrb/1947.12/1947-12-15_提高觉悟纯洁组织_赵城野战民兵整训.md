    Raise Awareness, Purify the Organization
    Zhao Cheng Field Militia Rectification
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 13th] The Zhao Cheng County Military Committee rectified the field militia company. Through speaking bitterness and digging up Chiang's roots, the class consciousness was raised, and the landlords and local bullies hidden in the militia were purged, purifying the militia organization. In mid-November, over a hundred members of the Zhao Cheng militia field company were concentrated at the County Military Committee for training. First, they self-reported their class background, and everyone discussed and assessed who were class brothers and who were alien elements, clearly delineating class boundaries. Then, in small and large meetings, they spoke bitterness, allowing everyone to understand, from concrete examples, the suffering and grievances endured by class brothers, and how cruelly the class enemies exploited our basic masses. For example, when militia member Hu Sheng recounted how his mother was seized by a landlord, all the militia members shed tears. Some comrades immediately proposed to arrest and struggle against the targets, while others demanded that the old root of the landlords, Chiang Kai-shek, must be uprooted. Because everyone's class consciousness was raised, they resolutely refused to allow the targets of struggle to control weapons, and were determined to purge them. Therefore, they first organized poor peasants and hired laborers to discuss and deliberate, put forward people with unclear political outlooks and methods for dealing with them, and then announced the crimes at the general meeting. Everyone unanimously handled several undesirable elements separately. For example, the local bully Zhang Xiaohe was sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and then handed over to the masses for handling; Gao Lindun, Liu Guangsheng, and five others were sent home.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 13th] According to a report from the Shi Zhenming Worker-Peasant Correspondent Group: After clearing the interior and rectifying the organization of the militia company in the seven administrative villages including Fushan Second District's Fan Village, the poor peasants took control of the guns, and the militia became a class-based armed force. On the 18th of last month, the entire company held a meeting in Yubai Village to discuss militia building issues. After reviewing the class background, it was discovered that Li Fu'an was a landlord who participated in the Quwo battle last year. Li Fu'an often asked, "When will we go back?" and never said how Chiang Kai-shek could be overthrown. Militia platoon leader Ren Shengcai was also a feudal rich peasant who not only violated mass discipline and took away people's quilts, but also embezzled 2,000 yuan used to comfort the militia in Yuantou Village. When traveling through Wenxi during the expedition to western Henan, he incited the militia, saying, "Crossing the river! Once we leave, we won't be able to come back. Many people in Henan were killed by planes or fell into the river and died." When departing from Shan County to the west, he wanted to lead a group of people to desert, but was discovered by the company commander and platoon leader, and he didn't succeed. After discussion and exposure of the harm of landlords participating in the militia, Ren Shengcai was dismissed from his post, and along with Li Fu'an and five others with landlord backgrounds, they were all purged and expelled from the militia organization.

    提高觉悟纯洁组织
    赵城野战民兵整训
    【本报太岳十三日电】赵城县武委会整训民兵野战连，经过诉苦挖蒋根，阶级觉悟提高，清洗了隐藏在民兵中的地主奸霸，纯洁了民兵的组织。十一月中旬，赵城民兵野战连×百余人，集中县武委会受训，首先自报成份，大家评议，认清了谁是阶级弟兄，谁是异己分子，划清了阶级界线后，又在小会大会上诉苦，使大家从具体的实例中，认识阶级弟兄所受的痛苦与所含的冤屈，阶级敌人又是如何残酷的压榨我们的基本群众，如李岩伙民兵虎生诉到他母亲被地主霸占去了的时候，全体民兵人人落泪，有的同志马上提出要去捉斗争对象，有的提出非把地主的老根子蒋介石拔掉不行。由于大家的阶级觉悟提高，坚决不让斗争对象掌握武器，一定要清洗出去。于是，首先组织贫雇讨论酝酿，提出政治面貌不清的人及处理办法，然后又在大会宣布罪状，大家一致将几个不良分子分别处理，如奸霸张小和送公安局审讯后，交群众处理；高林顿、刘广生等五人打发回家。
    【本报太岳十三日电】据石振明工农通讯组报导：浮山二区范村等七个行政村的民兵连，经过肃清内部、整顿组织后，贫农掌握了枪杆，民兵成为阶级武装。上月十八日，全连在玉白村开会，讨论民兵建设问题。经过审查成份，查出李福安是个地主，去年到曲沃参战，李福安时常问：“甚时回去？”从没说过怎样可以打倒蒋介石。民兵连排长任生才，也是一个封建富农，不仅破坏群众纪律，拿过老百姓的被子，还贪污过院头村慰劳民兵的两千块钱，在远征豫西作战道经闻喜时，就动摇民兵说“过河呀！走了不得回来，在河南被飞机炸死、跌在河里死了的人很多。”从陕县西开时，要带一批人开小差，被营长、连长发觉，才没跑成。经过讨论和揭发地主参加民兵的危害，当将任生才撤职，与地主成份的李福安等五人一并清洗，驱逐出民兵组织。
