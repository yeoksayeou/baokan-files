　　Taihang, December 24th (from our newspaper) The Anyang County calls for a swift rectification of old cooperatives, mobilizing poor and hired peasants to establish new cooperatives, and supporting the winter production of poor and hired peasants. Most of the village cooperatives in the county were established after the mass movement last year. Due to the formalism and work style of the cadres, combined with non-mass line, coercive and commandist practices, most of the funds used were the fruits of struggle. Although nominally the funds of the masses, the masses had no freedom to use them. Furthermore, the personnel of the cooperatives were mostly controlled by bankrupt landlords and rich peasants who were good at calculation and business. They were extravagant and indulged in excessive eating and drinking. To consolidate their position, they courted cadres who enjoyed eating and drinking as a shield. This resulted in many cooperatives not only failing to serve the masses but, on the contrary, violating the interests of the masses, causing opposition from the masses. During this inspection, it was found that the Shuizhi West Street Cooperative had over 10 million yuan in funds, all from the fruits of struggle. The Lunzhang Street in the Third District valued assets confiscated by the Farmers' Association from fleeing landlords (two vinegar shops, a pharmacy, a flour mill, a flower shop, and a grain store) at only 1.08 million yuan, and put it into the cooperative as capital. In the Xiqingliu Cooperative, five out of eight people were targets of struggle, who engaged in excessive eating and drinking without engaging in production, losing 10,000 yuan in over twenty days. The Tianxi Town Cooperative in the Seventh District opened an oil mill. The district authorities said that landlords should not be used, but the village cadres believed that landlords were capable and could make money, so they employed targets of struggle, but the result was that they did not make money. Later, they were replaced with hired and poor peasants, and each time they pressed oil, they produced twelve more catties than before. Half of the personnel in the Wangmazhuang Cooperative were targets of struggle and half were middle peasants, who specialized in trafficking in prohibited items such as pigments, tin foil, and yellow paper, violating government laws and losing the masses' shares. The Dongqingliu Cooperative in the Third District forcibly dispatched 50 people to build pigsties during the weeding season, disrupting the weeding production of the masses. Therefore, the county leadership proposed a swift and vigorous rectification of the old cooperatives, and pointed out: During the rectification, do not be afraid of collapse, as long as the masses are mobilized, they will be re-established. The fruits of struggle of the cooperatives should be completely and thoroughly distributed to the masses. When distributing, be sure to let the hired and poor peasants discuss and decide. After the distribution, the masses can re-invest. The personnel of the cooperative should be under the control of the hired and poor peasants. If individual technical personnel with bad composition are to be employed, it should be approved by the hired and poor peasants after discussion. In the future, the cooperative should focus on supporting the winter production of the masses, helping the masses purchase raw materials, and promoting the sale of finished products.

　　不许地主富农掌握为非作歹
  　安阳整顿合作社
  　凡斗争果实一律交还群众
    【本报太行二十四日电】安阳县号召迅速整顿旧合作社，发动雇贫成立新合作社，扶植雇贫冬季生产。该县的村合作社大部是去年群运后才建立起来的，由于干部的形式主义思想与作风，与非群众路线强迫命令的做法，资金大部用的是斗争果实，名义上是群众资金，实际上群众却无动用的自由。合作社的人员又大都为能打会算会做生意的破落地主、富农所掌握，铺张浪费大吃二喝，他们为巩固自己的地位，便拉拢能吃爱喝的干部作挡箭牌。致使许多合作社不但不为群众服务，相反违犯了群众利益，引起群众的反对。在这次检查中，发现水冶西街合作社资金有一千多万元，都是斗争果实；三区伦掌大街把农会没收逃亡地主的资财（两个醋铺、一个药铺，一个粉坊、一个花店、一个粮行），才作了一百零八万元价，入到合作社作为资金。西清流合作社有八个人，就有五个是斗争对象，每天大吃二喝不搞生产，二十余天赔钱一万元。七区天喜镇合作社开了一座油坊，区上说过不让用地主，但村干部则认为地主能干会赚钱，用上斗争对象，结果并未赚了钱；后来换成雇贫，每打一次油比以前多出十二斤。王马庄合作社人员一半是斗争对象，一半是中农，专贩颜料、锡箔、黄表等违禁品，违犯了政府法令，赔了群众股金。三区东清流合作社，正在锄苗时，强派群众五十人给修猪圈，破坏了群众的锄苗生产。为此，该县领导上提出迅速大力整顿旧合作社，并指出：在整顿时，不要怕垮台，只要是发动起群众来，就会再建立起来；合作社的斗争果实，应全部彻底分给群众，分的时候，一定要让雇贫讨论决定，分了后群众可重新入股，合作社的人员应是雇贫当权，如用个别成份不好的技术人员，可经雇贫讨论批准。今后合作社应以扶植群众冬季生产，帮助群众购买原料，推销成品为业务方向。
