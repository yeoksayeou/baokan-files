　　Taihang Supports Poor and Hired Laborers in Winter Production
　　Increases Allocation of 200 Million in Low-Interest Loans
　　[Our Newspaper, Taihang, 2nd dispatch] To address the financial difficulties faced by poor and hired laborers in Taihang District due to natural disasters and poor harvests, the Administrative Office and the Taihang Branch of the Jinnan Bank have decided to allocate an additional 200 million yuan in low-interest loans. This includes 50 million yuan for the First Special District, 50 million yuan for the Second Special District, and 35 million yuan for the Fifth Special District, with the remainder reserved by the district branch for flexible use. The interest rate will be uniformly set at eight li. Both organizations have issued separate instructions to the counties, emphasizing the need to thoroughly understand the demands and concerns of the poor and hired laborers during winter production. Based on this understanding, they should review the class line in past loans and make adjustments and transfers accordingly. In issuing new loans, it is imperative to allow the poor and hired laborers to evaluate, discuss, and allocate the funds. The loans should be promptly and strategically distributed to the impoverished and those lacking capital, organizing production based on local natural conditions. The instructions also stressed that the distribution of these new loans must adhere to the class line of serving the poor and hired laborers, i.e., the principle of allocating more to areas with a larger population of poor and hired laborers. It is essential to overcome non-class-based practices such as simply emphasizing the combination of certain private capital and rapid turnover, or mechanically limiting the use of funds.
　　[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd dispatch] The Yangcheng Sixth District Cooperative has organized 10 million shares to support winter production for hired and poor laborers, assisting them in textile production and transportation. Cadres of the cooperative recalled that in past loan distributions, loans had flowed into the hands of wealthy peasants and were used for improper purposes. For example, Li Shiqian, a wealthy peasant in Huancun, used a 20,000 yuan loan for speculation. The primary reason for this flaw was the lack of a clear class perspective and insufficient outreach. Li Shiqian's loan was granted solely based on the introduction of the village production committee member. Therefore, it was decided to dispatch four individuals this winter to specifically distribute loans in rural areas, attract idle funds, and fully support the hired and poor laborers, with particularly low interest rates. From November 1st to the present, 1.29 million yuan have already been loaned out, with 791,000 yuan loaned to hired and poor peasants. After receiving loans, women in the Lujiahe textile group are determined to improve the quality of their textiles to compete with outside goods. The first batch of 26 bolts of cloth is about to come off the looms. Guo Xiao＠'s mutual aid group of six hired and poor peasants in Baiduo Village engaged in transportation, but lacked sufficient funds, so the district cooperative provided a new loan of 20,000 yuan. Each transportation trip earns them 8,000 yuan profit per person after expenses. It is estimated that they can make five more trips by the end of the year, earning each person around 40,000 yuan, solving their own difficulties. At the same time, in order to universally develop the textile movement, women are encouraged to learn textile production, without fear of producing poor quality yarn. The poorer quality yarn that has been received will be dyed in different colors and woven into various blankets to open up textile sales channels.

　　太行扶助贫雇冬季生产
  　增拨低利贷款二万万
    【本报太行二日电】此间行署及冀南银行太行区行为解决贫雇群众弥补灾荒歉收进行生产的资金困难，特决定增拨低利贷款二万万元。计一专区五千万元，二专区五千万元，五专区三千五百万元，余则留区行作机动使用。利息一律八厘。该两机关并已分别指示各县，在冬季生产中，要深入贫雇层了解他们的要求与反映，根据此反映与要求，检查过去贷款中的阶级路线，进行调整与转移。在发放新贷款上，一定要让贫雇评议、讨论、分配使用。迅速将贷款有重点的分配到受灾及资金缺乏的贫雇手里，依各地自然条件组织生产。该指示并强调提出，此次新贷款的分配，必须贯彻为贫雇服务的阶级路线，即那里贫雇多，那里多分配的原则；克服单纯强调结合一定的私资与周转快及机械的限定用途等非阶级路线的做法。
    【本报太岳二日电】阳城六区区联社为扶植雇贫冬季生产，特组织一千万股金，帮助雇贫纺织、运输。该社干部回忆往年发放贷款中，曾将贷款流入富农手中，作不正当用途。如缓村富农李世乾，便将二万元的贷款做投机生意。造成此种缺陷的主要原因，是阶级观点的不明确，工作不深入。李世乾的贷款就是单听了该村生产委员的介绍。因此决定今冬抽出四个人，专门下乡发放贷款，并吸收游资，全力扶植雇贫，并且利息特别低。自十一月一日起至目前，已贷出一百二十九万元，其中雇贫农即贷七十九万一千元。芦家河纺织妇女贷款后，决心提高纺织质量，向外来货竞赛。现第一批二十六匹布将下机。柏朵村雇贫农郭小＠互助组，六个人进行运输，钱不够，区联社便新贷给二万元。运输一次，除吃喝外，每人赚利八千元。计算至年底可再运输五次，每人可赚四万元左右，解决了自己困难。同时为了将纺织运动普遍发展起来，号召妇女学习纺织，不要怕线纺不好。并将已收到质量较坏的线，染上颜色，织成各样毯子，打开纺织销路。
