　　The Crisis of the British Economic System
    By Varga, Translated by Qi Sheng

    Almost two years have passed since the end of the war against Hitler's Germany, and in Britain, as in other European capitalist countries that participated in the war, there is talk of the arrival of a "crisis of insufficient production." The unusual crisis of insufficient production in Britain can be successfully overcome by raising production to pre-war levels. However, the issue here concerns the crisis of Britain's special economic system (which was formed over a century after the abolition of grain tariffs in 1846). Of course, a special British social system does not exist—it was and still is capitalism. However, Britain's economic structure, even before the Second World War, was special and different from other capitalist countries in many ways.

    As is well known, the peculiarity of Britain's economic structure lies in the incomparably small proportion of agricultural economy, the dependence of the entire economy on the import of food and raw materials from abroad, and the special "urban" appearance of Britain compared to other countries. Let us cite a few figures to illustrate this. The last pre-war population census indicated the following percentage breakdown of occupations for all self-supporting men:

　　　　　　　　　　　　Engaged in Agriculture　Engaged in Industry　Engaged in Commerce　Household and Private Servitude
　　England and Wales　　　　6.2　　　　　　　48.2　　　　　　　27.6　　　　　　　　　7.3
　　United States　　　　　　22.0　　　　　　　35.2　　　　　　　27.4　　　　　　　　　6.2
　　Germany　　　　　　　　28.8　　　　　　　40.6　　　　　　　18.4　　　　　　　　　3.9

    We see that at that time, those engaged in agriculture in the United States accounted for one-fifth of male workers, while in Britain it was only one-sixteenth. There were more people serving the ruling class as servants (maids, cooks, grooms, dog handlers, etc.) than those engaged in agriculture. If we look at the composition of female labor, it becomes even clearer: only 1.1 percent of women were engaged in agriculture, while 21.4 percent were working as household servants and the like. These figures vividly illustrate the extravagance of the British ruling class, which exploited the world in one way or another, and vividly illustrate the parasitic nature of British imperialism.

    The basis of this economic structure—in which, with the exception of coal, four-fifths of food and almost all raw materials were imported from abroad—was the invincible competitiveness of British industry in the world market, the huge income obtained from abroad that the country did not directly repay with commodity exports, i.e., profits from foreign investment, super-profits from colonies, income from financial activities and insurance in world trade, and profits from shipping.

    The Second World War greatly damaged these foundations, which had already begun to disintegrate. Therefore, this old British economic system is undergoing an insurmountable crisis.

    Even before the war, British industry had difficulty supporting competition with the United States and Germany. As a result of the war, its competitiveness has further declined. Even after the First World War, the equipment of British industry, especially the mining industry, was in many ways far behind the United States, and during the war, this equipment was not replaced, so it became even more outdated and obsolete (except for the military industry). Now this backwardness has become widespread, except for certain "new" industrial sectors. The result is a decline in labor productivity. During the war, labor productivity in the United States increased by nearly 20 percent, while in Britain it generally did not exceed pre-war levels, and in some production sectors, it was even lower than pre-war levels. The coal industry is the best example. The annual output of commercial coal per worker, excluding their personal consumption, was: 1938—302 tons, 1940—299 tons, 1942—287 tons, 1943—275 tons, 1944—259 tons, 1945—245 tons.

    This continuous decline in labor productivity in the coal industry is due to the deterioration of equipment and the lack of young, skilled miners. The result, as is well known, is that in Britain, which was the number one coal exporter before the war, a sharp coal shortage has arisen. Coal production in 1946 was unable to meet even Britain's domestic needs. Five million tons of coal were consumed from the reserves of power stations, factories, etc., within a year. Therefore, it is not surprising that during this year's unusually severe winter in Britain, when snowdrifts blocked railway coal transportation for several weeks, power stations could not supply electricity, and many factories were forced to close down due to lack of electricity. During this most acute coal shortage, the number of unemployed reached 2.5 million!

    The labor productivity, which is significantly lower than that of the United States, has led to an increase in production costs and difficulties in exporting British industrial products, which to a considerable extent is the foundation of Britain's traditional economic structure. Under other similar conditions, British industry is now hardly able to compete with American industry, if we do not consider sectors such as shipbuilding, the radio industry, and woolen fabric production.

    Seemingly contradictory to this is that British exports once even exceeded pre-war levels after the end of the war. According to figures from the Ministry of Commerce, British exports (at 1938 values), with 1938 as 100, were:
　　July 1946——120 (highest level)
　　December——103
　　January 1947——112
　　February——93

    But what is more decisive here is that not all of Britain's exports compete with the United States under similar conditions. As is well known, the export of British industrial products to countries within the British Empire enjoys so-called preferential tariffs. In 1945, exports to the interior of the Empire accounted for 54 percent of British exports, and in 1946—about 50 percent. Thus, the first priority was to satisfy the import needs of the British Dominions that had not been delivered during the war years. The satisfaction of these needs temporarily gave Britain the possibility to increase its exports.

    However, the 1938 export level is now absolutely insufficient to guarantee the necessary import of British food and raw materials.

    As mentioned earlier, most of Britain's imports before the war were not paid for with commodities. According to the figures in the official White Paper "Economic Survey" of 1947, the British balance of payments for 1938 and 1946 was as follows (in millions of pounds):

　　Category　　　1938　　　1946
　　Imports　　　　826　　　1,100
　　Government Spending Abroad　13　　　　300
　　Total Expenditures:　　　　839　　　1,400
　　Exports (and Re-exports)　　　533　　　900
　　Income from Foreign Investment　175　　　60
　　Other Income　　　　　　　61　　　Not Available
　　Total Income:　　　　　　　769　　　950
　　Deficit:　　　　　　　　　70　　　450

    Even in 1938 (when Britain received an income of 236 million pounds from abroad in addition to income from commodity exports), Britain had to spend 70 million pounds from its foreign investments to cover its balance of payments deficit. At that time, its traditional economic structure was already under attack. In 1946, the balance of payments deficit reached 450 million pounds, or half the value of total exports. Of this, 300 million pounds were spent by Britain to maintain its troops in Greece, Palestine, and other countries. The British government attempted to reduce this expenditure to 175 million pounds in 1947, but even in this situation, the deficit would still be nearly 300 million pounds. To balance the balance of payments, Britain must export 300 million pounds more goods than in 1946. However, since the production of British industrial products for export requires foreign raw materials—copper, brass, zinc, wool, cotton, etc.—and obtaining these raw materials requires foreign means of payment, the value of British exports must increase by 75 percent compared to 1938. This is a truly difficult task to solve.

    The British government expects that with the US$3.75 billion loan from the United States and the US$1.25 billion loan from Canada, it will be able to eliminate its balance of payments deficit within five years. It also plans to use this loan to first purchase American machinery to re-equip its industry, and to expand its capital accumulation by reducing domestic needs. Thus, it will gradually renew its industrial equipment and balance its balance of payments on the basis of the traditional British economic structure.

    However, it is now clear that this plan cannot be completed. The American loan, which was supposed to be the source of eliminating the balance of payments deficit in five years, was spent in eleven months, accounting for nearly one-third of the total loan amount.

    What explains this is not only that British trade is completely in deficit. British trade is particularly in deficit in its relations with countries that need to use US dollars for purchases. The British "Economist" magazine wrote in its March 8, 1947 issue:

    "In 1946, our imports from the dollar area increased from 22.3 percent before the war to 35.1 percent, while our exports to that area decreased from 10.1 percent before the war to 7.6 percent... This is why we are using up our dollar loans so quickly."

    The situation is deteriorating further because Britain's purchases in the Americas have so far been dominated not by machinery, as previously expected, but by consumer goods—grain, meat, and tobacco. Because Britain's machine-building factories primarily produce for export, Britain's industrial equipment at present, nearly two years after the end of the war, has still not become better than before the war.

    The government plans to use 20 percent of production in 1947 (instead of 16.5 percent before the war) to maintain and expand production equipment. Thus, no large-scale renovation will be seen this year either.

    The British bourgeoisie is even attempting to re-consolidate other foundations of Britain's old economic structure, namely, various incomes from abroad. Shipyards are now frantically manufacturing new ships for British shipping companies. British overseas banks have also resumed their activities. Yes, a well-thought-out capital export has begun. However, in various countries and fields, Britain is clashing with an even more powerful competitor—the United States.

    The workers are the first to suffer in the crisis of the British economic system. Rationing of food, clothing, and shoes continues to this day. Even according to the White Paper figures, spending on daily consumer goods in 1946 was nearly 10 percent lower than before the war. On the other hand, military spending increased from 7 percent of national income in 1938 to 11 percent of national income in 1946.

    Britain's old economic structure is undergoing an insurmountable crisis. In the conditions formed after the war, it is no longer possible to revive the British economy on its original basis. It must establish a new structure, in which agricultural economy occupies the same proportion as it does in the United States and Germany. Britain can no longer afford things like several million hectares of land not being used as arable land but as hunting grounds and private gardens. After Britain has lost its original status as the world's manufacturer, world banker, and world big employer, and when its position as a colonial power is increasingly under attack, it cannot continue to preserve those countless feudal manors with hundreds and thousands of servants and the traditional extravagant life of the British ruling class.

　　英国经济制度的危机
    瓦尔加作、齐生译
    从反对希特勒德国的战争结束时起，差不多已经两年过去了，在英国，也像在欧洲其他曾参战的资本主义国家一样，都在谈论“生产不足危机”的到来。在英国所发生的不平常的生产不足危机，虽然可以用提高生产到战前水平的方法，顺利地加以克服。但是这里问题是关于英国特殊的经济制度（这个制度是一八四六年废止粮食关税后整百年中形成的）底危机。当然，特殊的英国社会制度并不存在，——它曾经是而且还仍然是资本主义的。但是，英国的经济结构，在二次大战前就是特殊的，在许多方面是不同于其他资本主义国家。
    众所周知，英国经济结构的这个特殊性，在于农业经济的不可比拟的小的比重，整个经济依赖于从国外输入食品和原料，在于英国同其他国家比较时所谓“城市”的特殊面貌。我们且引用几个数字来加以说明。战前最后一次的居民登记指出，全部自立男子的职业划分百分比如下：从事农业者　从事工业者　从事商业者　家庭和私人奴役英格兰和威尔士　六．二　四八．二　二七．六　七．三美国　二二．○　三五．二　二七．四　六．二德国　二八．八　四○．六　一八．四　三．九
    我们看，那时在美国从事农业者占男性工人五分之一，而在英国仅占十六分之一。给统治阶级作仆役（佣人、厨子、马夫、看狗人等等）的人，比从事农业的人还多。如果看一看女性劳工的成份那就更明鲜了：总共只有百分之一点一的妇女从事农业，而百分之二十一点四的妇女是作家庭仆役等类工作。这些数字活生生地说明了用此一或彼一方式剥削全世界的英国统治阶级生活的奢侈性，活生生地说明了英国帝国主义的寄生性。
    这种经济结构——其中除煤以外，五分之四的食品与几乎全部的原料都自国外输入——的基础，曾是英国工业在世界市场上的无敌的竞争力，从国外获得的国家不直接以商品输出偿付的巨大收入，即在外国投资的利润，殖民地的超额利润，世界贸易中金融活动的收入及保险事业收入，航运的利润。
    第二次世界大战大大地毁坏了早已开始趋于瓦解的这些基础。因此这个英国的老经济制度，正经受着不可克服的危机。
    在战前英国的工业就已很困难支持同美国与德国的竞争。由于战争的结果，它的竞争力是更低落了。还在第一次大战之后，英国工业，特别是采矿工业的装备，在许多方面都大大落后于美国，而在战时，这些装备又没有改换过，因此就更加古旧与陈腐了（军事工业例外）。现在这个落后除了某些“新的”工业部门外，已成为普遍的了。其结果则是劳动生产力的下降。在战时美国的劳动生产力曾提高将近百分之二十，英国这时则一般地没有超过战前水平，而在某些生产部门中，甚至还低于战前水平。煤业就是最好的例子。每个工人除去其个人消费外，商品煤的年产量是：一九三八年——三百零二吨，一九四○年——二九九吨，一九四二年——二八七吨，一九四三年——二七五吨，一九四四年——二五九吨，一九四五年——二四五吨。
    这种在煤业中劳动生产力的不断降落，原因是由于装备的腐败，和缺乏年青的熟练矿工。而其结果则是众所周知的，即在这个在战前煤出口各国中占第一把交椅的英国，引起了尖锐的煤荒。一九四六年煤的生产，没有能够满足甚至英国国内的需要。一年内从各电站、各工厂等的贮藏中耗掉了五百万吨煤。因此，当今年这次对英国非常的严冬中，雪堆阻滞铁路的煤运几周时，电站就不能供给电流，而许多工厂被迫因缺乏电力而关门大吉，是不足惊奇的了。在这次最尖锐的煤荒时期，失业人数曾达二百五十万！
    比美国显得十分低下的劳动生产力，引起生产成本的增大和英国工业品输出的困难，而这个输出在相当大的程度上是英国传统的经济结构的基础。在其他类似的条件下，英国工业现时几无能力与美国工业竞争，如果不计及像造船业，无线电工业，毛织品生产等部门的话。
    与这一点似乎矛盾的，是战争结束后英国输出曾一度甚至超过战前的水平。据商务部的数字，英国的输出（照一九三八年的价值），如果以一九三八年为一百，则一九四六年七月——一二○（最高水平）
　　十二月——一○三一九四七年一月——一一二
　　二月——九三
    但是在这里有着更决定的意义的，则是：英国的全部输出并非都是在类似的条件下同美国竞争。众所周知，英国工业品的输出到英帝国内部各国，是享有所谓特惠关税的。一九四五年输往帝国内部的，曾占英国输出百分之五十四，而在一九四六年——大约百分之五十。这样，首先是满足了在战争年份中未曾交付的，英国各自治领的输入需要。这些需要的满足就暂时给了英国以提高其输出的可能。
    可是一九三八年的输出水平，在现时是绝对不足以保证英国食品与原料的必要输入的。
    如前所述，战前英国的大部分输入品不以商品偿付。照一九四七年官方白皮书“经济调查”的数字，一九三八年与一九四六年英国支付差额如下：（单位百万镑）类别　一九三八年　一九四六年输入　八二六　一、一○○政府在国外的支出　一三　三○○支出总计： 八三九　一、四○○输出（与再输出）　五三三　九○○国外投资收入　一七五　六○其他收入　六一　不敷一○收入总计： 七六九  九五○收支不敷：　七○　四五○
    还在一九三八年（当时英国除了从商品输出所得收入外，尚从国外得到二亿三千六百万镑的进款），英国就已经不能不从自己国外的投资中耗去七千万镑以偿付其收支的赤字。在那时，她的传统的经济结构就已经处于打击之下。在一九四六年，收支的赤字达到了四亿五千万镑，亦即全部输出品价值的一半。其中三亿镑是英国为了保持她在希腊、巴勒斯坦及其他国家的驻军而支出的。英国政府企图将此项支出在一九四七年减低到一亿七千五百万镑，但就在这种情形下赤字也还有将近三亿镑的数目。为了平衡收支，英国必须比一九四六更多输出三亿镑的货物。但是由于要生产输出的英国工业品，需要外国的原料——铜，白铜，亚铅，羊毛，棉花等等，为了获得这些原料又要求外国的支付手段，因此，英国输出的价值，就必须比一九三八年增加百分七十五。而这是一个真正难于解决的任务。
    英国政府预计，有了美国的三十七亿五千万美元贷款及加拿大十二亿五千万美元的贷款，就可以在五年内消除其收支不敷的赤字。它并且盘算用此项贷款首先购买美国的机器来改装自己的工业，用节缩国内需要的方法来扩大其资本的积累，于是，逐步地更新工业的装备，在传统的英国经济结构的基础上，平衡收支。
    然而目前已很明显，这个计划是不能完成的。美国的贷款本应是五年内消除收支不敷赤字的泉源，却在八个月中就用掉了十一亿元，即几占贷款总额的三分之一。
    说明这点的不仅是英国贸易完全是入超。英国的贸易特别是在同那些需用美元购买的国家的关系中是入超。英国“统计学者”杂志在一九四七年三月八日的一期中写道：
    “一九四六年内，我们从美元区的输入，从战前的百分之二十二点三变成百分之三十五点一，而对那里的输出则从战前的百分之十点一变成百分之七点六……这就是为什么我们这样快地消耗了自己的美元借款。”
    情况的日趋恶化还由于英国在美洲的购买，迄今占首位的不是机器，象以前所预计的那样，而是消费品——粮食、肉、烟草。因为英国的机器制造工厂，首先是为输出而生产，因此英国工业的装备在现时，战争结束后差不多两年之后，仍然没有比战前变得更好些。
    政府拟于一九四七年将生产的百分之二十（而不是战前的百分之十六点五）用来维持和扩大生产的装备。这样，就在这一年里也看不到大规模的更新。
    英国资产阶级甚至企图重新巩固英国的旧经济结构之其他的基础，即自国外所得的各项收入。各造船厂现在狂热地为英国航运公司制造着新的船只。英国各海外银行也恢复了自己的活动。是的，一个深谋远虑的资本输出是开始了。可是在世界各国和各种领域中，英国同一个更有力的竞争者——美国发生冲突。
    在英国经济制度的危机中首先遭受苦痛的是工人。迄今食品、衣服、鞋子的配给制仍继续着。即使根据白皮书的数字，一九四六年日用消费品的支出差不多比战前低了百分之十。另一方面，军费支出却从一九三八年占国民收入百分之七增长到一九四六年占国民收入百分之十一。
    英国的古老的经济结构，正经受着不可克服的危机。在战后所形成的条件中，在原来基础上复兴英国经济，是没有更多的可能的。它必须建立新的结构，使农业经济在其中占有如在美国和德国所占的那种比重。几百万海克脱土地不用来当作耕地而当作狩猎场和用作私人花园之类的这样的事情，英国是再担负不起了。在英国丧失了世界制造业、世界银行家、世界大顾主的原来地位之后，当她作为一个殖民强国的地位已日益遭受打击的时候，她不可能继续保存那有着成千成百的仆役和英国统治阶级传统奢侈生活的无数封建贵族采邑了。
