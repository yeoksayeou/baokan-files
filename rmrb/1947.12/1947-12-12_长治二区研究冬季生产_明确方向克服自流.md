    Changzhi Second District Studies Winter Production
    Clarifies Direction and Overcomes Drift
    [This newspaper's Changzhi News] The Second District convened a district cadre meeting in late last month to study the reasons why the movement could not be launched. How were the villages that did launch the movement doing it? It was discovered that district and village cadres were not clear enough about the direction of winter production, and there was a general phenomenon of drifting, with people thinking that winter was a slack season, looking down on small amounts of money, and being vague about organizing winter production. How should the movement be carried out in the future? After research, the following issues were clarified: (1) After Nantianhe summarized the three autumn harvests, cadres and the masses said: "It's too cold to accumulate fertilizer, so we should take a good rest." Women prepared to make several pairs of shoes for the New Year and were not prepared to organize for production again. The leadership was not clear enough and had no way to guide the masses' thinking. After discovering this idea, the Cao Linshui Brigade immediately calculated the account of "plow three, surplus one," and found that thirteen households did not have enough to eat, and five households had enough to eat but no surplus. The entire team calculated that they were still short 240 dan of grain and could not reach "plow three, surplus one." This kind of examination cleared everyone's thinking, and the slogan proposed was "Earn both big and small money to ensure filling the big hole." At that time, twelve livestock were organized to carry out transportation and fertilizer accumulation. Xiguxian and Fengcun used this method to carry out the movement, but Beidong, Jiacun, and Ancheng did not clear their thinking in this way, so the movement did not unfold. (2) The poor and hired peasants could not take power, and the movement became more and more relaxed. Nantian Dong weaving has the most foundation in the history of the entire district, but in the past year, the organizations have been taking care of themselves, and there is not a real weaving group, because landlords and rich peasants have seized power and are carrying out sabotage, saying: "Whoever learns to weave, the public will take eight feet of cloth a day, and one spinning wheel will take four liang of cotton a day. The Taiyue District forced three weaving heroes to jump into a well because they needed cloth." This is how they scare the masses from producing well. In July, a weaving factory was opened, and seven landlords and rich peasants and seventeen old middle peasants learned to weave, and two poor peasants were squeezed out halfway. The poor and hired peasants said clearly: "In the past, landlords and rich peasants were in power, and now landlords and rich peasants are still in power. When will the poor be able to get ahead?" In Beitianhe, a village with no weaving foundation, there are eleven weaving groups in the village, and the group leaders are nine poor and hired peasants and two middle peasants. The village's weaving movement is in full swing, and it is planned to spin 350 jin of thread and weave 360 zhang of cloth by the end of the year. Gaohe dismissed five landlord and rich peasant cadres and replaced them with five poor and hired peasant leaders, and the movement unfolded. (3) The question of organization is how to implement the experience of mutual assistance and mutual benefit organized in the three autumn harvests into winter production. Xinyi summarized the experience of mutual assistance and mutual benefit in the three autumn harvests and promoted winter production, so the movement was not drifting. In Nandong, more than forty of the fifty livestock were gone, and they were all taking care of themselves. If you want to organize, the main point is to summarize the past experience of mutual assistance and mutual benefit in the three autumn harvests and implement it into winter production, then the movement can be organized and carried out. (4) The issue of equal value calculation of work points and dividends is the key to consolidating and improving mutual aid groups. The Su Dian Eryun group's weaving has fair equivalent values, and everyone is working very hard; Nandong's equivalent values are unfair, and weaving families are unwilling to spin, and those who weave cannot learn to weave, and those who can weave are unwilling to teach others. Beidong does not implement equivalent value dividends, and seven women spin ten liang of cotton a day. Therefore, mutual assistance cannot be consolidated if equivalent value is not properly resolved. (5) Transform cooperatives, with the poor and hired peasants in charge, to become the leading core of winter production. After the transformation of the Jiajiazhuang Village Cooperative, five landlords were squeezed out, and the poor and hired peasants took power. That day, seven livestock were organized for transportation, and they earned 120,000 yuan in one trip. When a middle peasant in Xixiahe was the manager of the cooperative and collected hemp, he sold more than 900 jin of hemp to a hemp shop in the city for 250 yuan per jin, took the money to make speculative deals, and now the price of hemp has risen to 450 yuan per jin, and he has not yet bought the hemp, resulting in a loss of 190,000 yuan. He used 150,000 yuan of transportation loans from the masses to fill the hole. The masses were very dissatisfied, and the loan was for transportation, but you used the loan to fill the gap. The masses immediately replaced him and elected a poor and hired peasant. There are a total of twenty people in the Nandong Cooperative, eleven of whom are targets of struggle. They lost 160,000 yuan to the masses in one month. The Su Dian Beidong Cooperative kills two sheep a day to sell mutton soup, which is not organizing mass production. If the cooperative is not transformed, and the poor and hired peasants cannot be in charge, and the business is not transformed, winter production will not be organized.

    长治二区研究冬季生产
    明确方向克服自流
    【本报长治讯】二区于上月下旬召开区干部会，研究运动开展不了的原因，有的村开展了，是怎样开展的？发现区村干部对冬季生产方向不够明确，普遍存在着自流现象，认为冬闲，看不起小钱，对冬季生产组织起来也是模糊的。今后如何开展运动？经过研究，明确了以下几个问题：（一）南天河自总结了三秋后，干部群众说：“天冻不能积肥，可该好好休息休息了。”妇女准备做上几双鞋好叫过年穿，不准备再去组织起来生产。在领导上不够明确，无办法指导群众思想。发现这种思想后，曹林水大队即算耕三余一帐，发现十三户不够吃，五户够吃无余，全队算了算还少二百四十石粮食达不到耕三余一。这样检查打通了大家思想，提的口号是“大小钱都要赚，保证填起大窟窿”。当时就组织了十二个牲口，开展了运输积肥。西故县、冯村都是用这个办法开展的运动，北董、贾村、安城没有这样打通思想，运动就没有展开。（二）贫雇掌不了权，运动越搞越松。南董纺织在全区历史上最有基础，但一年来组织各顾各，没有一个真正纺织组，原因是地主富农掌了权，还进行破坏，说：“谁学会织布公家一天要八尺布，一个车子一天要四两花，太岳区因为要布迫的三个纺织英雄跳了井”。这样来唬吓群众不好好生产。七月里开过一个学织布工厂，学会织布的地主富农七个，旧中农十七个，内有两个贫农学到半途给挤出来啦。贫雇明则说：“过去是地主富农掌权，现在还是地主富农掌权，甚时穷人也吃不开。”北天河纺织无基础村，全村十一个纺织组，组长是九个贫雇两个中农，全村纺织运动开展的轰轰烈烈，计划年底纺三百五十斤线，织三百六十丈布。高河罢免了五个地主富农干部，换上了五个贫雇领导，运动才展开。（三）组织问题是如何把三秋中组织起来互助互利的经验贯彻到冬季生产中去。信义是总结了三秋互助互利经验，推动了冬季生产，所以运动不是自流的。南董五十个牲口走了四十多个，都是各顾各走了。想要组织起来，主要一点是总结过去三秋互助互利经验，贯彻到冬季生产中去，运动才能组织起来开展。（四）等价计工分红问题，是巩固提高互助组关键。苏店二云组纺织等价公道，大家干的都很带劲；南董等价不公，纺家不愿意纺，织时又学不会织，会织家不愿意教别人。北董不实行等价分红，七个妇女一天纺花十两。所以等价不适当解决，互助巩固不了。（五）改造合作社，贫雇当家，成为冬季生产领导核心。焦家庄村合作社经过改造，挤出了五个地主，贫雇掌了权，当天组织了七个牲口运输，走了一回赚洋十二万元。西下河一个中农在合作社当经理收麻时候，卖给城内麻行九百余斤麻，每斤二百五十元，支上钱做投机买卖，到现在每斤麻涨至四百五十元，还没给人家买上麻，结果赔了十九万元，把群众做运输贷款洋十五万元填了窟窿，群众非常不满意，贷款是叫搞运输，你拿上贷款填圪道，群众起来马上把他换了，选了个贫雇。南董合作社里边共有二十个人，就有十一个斗争对象，一个月给群众赔了十六万元，苏店北董合作社一天杀两只羊卖羊汤，不是组织群众生产。如果合作社不改造，贫雇当不了家，不改造业务，冬季生产就不会有组织的开展。（张汉清、郭生秀）
