Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan, December 24th: The People's Liberation Army is continuing to expand its offensive on the Longhai Railway front, and has annihilated another entire brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The Front Headquarters has just issued Public Announcement No. 31, stating that a unit of our army captured Liuheji and Liuhe Station on the Longhai Railway at 8:00 AM on the 22nd, annihilating the 5th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Provisional 24th Division. The brigade commander, Major General Chen Fumin, was also captured alive. Two American-style howitzers were seized. Detailed battle results are still being investigated. It is reported that this brigade, in coordination with the Reorganized 5th Division and other units, attempted to reinforce Kaifeng. They sneaked from Shangqiu to Liuhe on the 20th and were annihilated in less than two days. The 7th Brigade of the same division was annihilated in the Battle of Dangshan as early as November 10th. (Xinhua News Agency relayed Public Announcement No. 29 from the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front Headquarters on the 21st—see the "Battle Process and Enemy Annihilation Numbers" section of this newspaper on the 23rd—the following corrections should be made: 1. In the second item, after "......six companies," add "the cavalry 1st Brigade garrison office and the brigade's artillery battalion." 2. The entire third item should be voided and replaced with "(3) At 4:00 PM on the 14th, our army captured Xinzheng Station, annihilating the headquarters and one battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Ministry of National Defense Independent 26th Brigade, the Officer Corps of the Reorganized 5th Division, the Security Team, and other units, totaling 1,056 men. At the same time, our army captured Xinzheng County, Xie Village, Xue Dian, two stations, and the Meng Zhuang stronghold, also annihilating a battalion headquarters and two companies of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Ministry of National Defense Independent 26th Brigade.")

Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, December 24th: A front-line reporter reported that a unit of the People's Liberation Army, using fewer troops to defeat more, annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Cavalry 1st Brigade (formerly the 7th Cavalry Division). The report stated that a unit of our army marched 130 *li* in one day and night on the 13th, crossed the Jialu River, and went straight to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Cavalry 1st Brigade entrenched at Damiao, ten *li* west of Weishi city. The enemy, hearing the news, fled in panic to the southwest, retreating to Guantingzhai. The People's Liberation Army immediately tracked and pursued them, and on the same day (the 14th) surrounded the enemy in strongholds such as Yangqiao, Gaoxingzhuang, and Guantingzhai. On the morning of the 15th, the People's Liberation Army concentrated artillery fire and fired fiercely. The enemy, unable to hold out, desperately tried to break through, but was again tightly surrounded by the People's Liberation Army outside the south gate of the southwest village. The dense and chaotic enemy cavalry were like stray dogs, scurrying in all directions. Our brave fighters shouted and killed like hunters surrounding rabbits, and machine guns and small cannons fired together. Suddenly, smoke and dust filled the air. Enemy soldiers fell off their saddles one after another. Some fell into pools of blood with their horses. People and horses were lying across the ground, and blood and mud were frozen together. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army in the north gate occupied the village, and the enemy cavalry were compressed into the moat (dry river ditch) outside the village, unable to climb the river bank, and had to surrender. Some remnants of the enemy, riding lame horses to escape, were also captured by us one by one. In a fierce battle lasting one and a half hours, the entire 2nd Regiment and most of the 1st Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Cavalry 1st Brigade were annihilated by us. Only the enemy brigade commander, Chen Tao, fled in panic with two regimental commanders and a few remnants. The Cavalry 1st Brigade, known as the elite of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit cavalry, was completely finished.

　　陇海前线继续扩展攻势
  　我军歼匪一个整旅
  　克柳河集及车站活捉敌旅长陈福民
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十四日电】解放军于陇海路前线继续扩展攻势，又全歼蒋匪一个整旅。前线司令部顷发表第三十一号公报称：我军一部于二十二日上午八时攻克陇海路上之柳河集及柳河车站，歼灭蒋匪暂编第二十四师第五旅，少将旅长陈福民亦被生俘，缴获美式榴弹炮两门，详细战果正清查中。按该旅配合整五师等部，图增援开封，于二十日由商邱窜抵柳河未及二日即被歼灭。该师之第七旅，则早于十一月十日被歼于砀山之役。（新华社二十一日转播苏鲁豫皖前线司令部第二十九号公报——见二十三日本报——“作战经过与歼敌番号”一段中，应作如下补正：一、第二项中在“…………六个连”之下增添“骑兵第一旅留守处及该旅炮兵营”。二、第三项全文作废，改为“（三）十四日下午四时，我军攻克新郑车站，歼灭蒋匪国防部独立第二十六旅第一团团部及其一个营、整五师军官总队、保安队等部一千零五十六名。同时我军攻克新郑县城、谢庄、薛店两车站及孟庄据点，又歼蒋匪国防部独立第二十六旅一个营部及两个连。”）
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十四日电】前线记者报导解放军某部以少胜多，歼蒋匪骑兵第一旅（原骑七师）之经过称：我军某部于十三日一昼夜间，跋涉一百三十里，渡过贾鲁河，直奔盘踞尉氏城西十里大庙之蒋匪骑兵第一旅，敌闻风仓惶向西南逃窜，退守官亭寨。解放军当即跟踪追击，是日（十四日）夜即将敌包围于洋桥、高兴庄、官亭寨等据点内。十五日晨，解放军集中炮火猛烈射击，敌不支，拼力突围，复被解放军紧紧包围于西南圩子之南门外，密集而混乱的敌骑如丧家之犬，四面乱窜，我猛勇战士象猎人围兔子一样高声喊杀，机枪小炮一齐射击，顿时烟尘迷＠，敌兵纷纷滚下马鞍，有的连人带马倒在血泊里，满地人马纵横，血泥冻结。与此同时，北门解放军占领了圩子，敌骑被压缩在圩外护城壕（干河沟）里，爬不上河堤，只得束手就擒。一些骑着跛马逃命的残敌，亦为我一一俘虏。在一个半钟头的激战中，蒋匪骑一旅第二团全部及第一团大部皆为我歼灭。仅敌旅长陈陶带着两个团长及极少残敌狼狈窜逃。号称蒋匪骑兵精锐的骑一旅就此完结了。
