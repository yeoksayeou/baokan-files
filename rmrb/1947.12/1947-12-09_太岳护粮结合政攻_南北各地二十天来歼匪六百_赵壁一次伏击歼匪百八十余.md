[Our Newspaper Taiyue 7th Dispatch] The guerrilla warfare in Taiyue's north and south has become active again, with over six hundred Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits annihilated in the past twenty days. In Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi and other places in northern Yue, with grain protection as the center, and at the same time as repelling two divisions of Yan's bandits on November 14, the Jiexiu guerrillas were active behind Yan's bandits, and in Dajin Village (twenty miles south of the city), they defeated Yan's bandit district office and three township offices, killing and capturing eight bandits, seizing one machine gun, one small cannon, and three rifles. On the 11th, the Lingshi and Zhaocheng guerrillas and militia also routed more than 30 Yan bandit "Self-Defense Corps" who came to Yanan Village (fifteen miles east of the city) to loot grain, capturing six Yan bandits alive and seizing five rifles. On the 25th, Yan's bandits in Jiexiu, not giving up, again used the 3rd and 8th squadrons of the 18th Regiment of Hongshan and Sendai, and more than 100 people from the Sendai Village Office, to harass and loot grain in the Liugou, Xialinggou, and Jianli areas; part of our 41st unit cooperated with Zhang Ximan's combat team and ambushed them in the area. As soon as Yan's bandits entered the ambush circle, they launched a fierce attack, killing and wounding 30 bandits and capturing 57, seizing five light and heavy machine guns, three small cannons, forty-six rifles, one pistol, and a batch of ammunition. Taking advantage of the victory, we recovered Sendai without any casualties. On the 3rd, the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the 44th Division of Yan's bandits from Xiquan was ambushed by us in Zhaobi and Liuquan, and most of them were annihilated; according to preliminary statistics, more than 70 people, including Battalion Commander Ge Guojun, were killed and wounded, and more than 110 were captured, seizing one and a half heavy machine guns, four light machine guns, three small cannons, more than 90 rifles, eight livestock, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. The area near Linfen is also centered on protecting grain, combined with political offensives. More than 100 people from Yan's bandit "Township Office" in Ducun went to Zhaoqu to loot grain on November 16 and were repelled by the 2nd District detachment of Linfen, and pursued to the west of Yancun (ten miles southeast of Xiangling), where they fled into the water, with ten killed and captured. On the 26th, 16 people from the Qiaoli Township Office were severely attacked by our militia in Xiwang Village, killing, wounding and capturing six bandits. After our victory, we held a mass meeting to celebrate. On the 29th, our local armed forces took the initiative to attack the Ducun stronghold. After one hour of battle, 21 were killed and captured, and 50 rifles were seized, with only two of our men slightly injured. From November 21 to 30 alone, the militia fought ten battles, killing, wounding and capturing 55 bandits, arresting 48 traitors, bullies and secret agents, and winning over four Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan soldiers to cross over. In particular, they combined political offensives to launch a mass armed grain protection struggle in the border and guerrilla areas. Hou Village voluntarily donated money to buy guns, and seven villages including Dongxi Zhang Village and Yanma have armed themselves to participate in the struggle.
After the Chiang bandits were repelled from northern Yuncheng in southern Jin, the Anyi and Yuncheng cities were besieged by guerrilla warfare. On the 21st, the Chiang bandits in Yuncheng used more than 200 police officers from Jie County and Yishi to probe towards Nanzhuang, but were repelled by our unit, killing and wounding nine. On the 29th, the Chiang bandits again used more than 2,000 men from the 309th Regiment, the 250th Regiment, and one battalion each of Yan's remnant troops to attack Beizhang Village, but were again repelled by us, killing and wounding 49 Chiang bandits, capturing four, and seizing one light machine gun, two rifles, and one bicycle. The enemy then fled back to Yuncheng. On the 2nd of this month, the Yan bandits' "Love the Country Corps" in Anyi City again attacked Zhangsun Village, but were still repelled by us, with more than ten killed and wounded.
