    Yubei Our Troops Launch Proactive Attacks to Protect Fields and Grain
    Capturing Qimen and Annihilating 400 Bandits
    Ambush in Wen County Eliminates Enemy Company Commander and 40+ Soldiers
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] On the morning of the 16th, a certain unit of the Yubei Liberation Army captured Qimen, a major town on the Wei River southwest of Junxian County. They largely annihilated the bandits of the Junxian County Security Regiment and the township governments entrenched in the town, killing and wounding over a hundred, capturing over three hundred alive, seizing four light and heavy machine guns, over two hundred long and short guns, eight warhorses, and a portion of grain. Fifteen captured civilians were liberated, with only six of our soldiers wounded or killed.
    [This Newspaper, Taihang, 15th] The local armed forces of the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district actively attack to protect fields and grain, continuing to achieve victories. On the 13th of this month, over three hundred bandits from the Wenxian County Security Regiment stationed in Nan Jia went to Tang Guo and Jia Bao in Wenxian County to loot grain. A unit of our Eastward Advance Detachment learned of this and set up an ambush at Liu Village on the enemy's return route. The next day, as the enemy returned to their lair, they fell into our ambush. We immediately launched a sudden attack, and the enemy, unable to withstand it, fled like rabbits towards the Yellow River滩 and Nan Jia. We pursued and attacked, killing and wounding 43 enemy soldiers, including a company commander. Many of the remaining enemies drowned after jumping into the Yellow River. We captured four rifles, one small cannon, over two hundred rounds of ammunition, and one Mauser pistol.
    [This Newspaper, Taiyue, 18th] The militiamen of the Mengxian County First District captured Xu Zhende, the assassination squad leader of the bandit puppet Zhang Bohua's forces, and six others, greatly pleasing the people. Zhang Bohua, a major traitor from Mengxian County, continues to send special agents across the river to carry out assassinations and probe military intelligence even after fleeing to Mengjin, Henan. On the night of December 2nd, Zhang sent his trusted assassination squad leader Xu Zhende, leading several men, to secretly cross the river and hide in the border area of our First and Sixth Districts, attempting to assassinate district and village cadres and activists in the Taiping Township area. After learning of this, our First District rotating militiamen repeatedly searched this area. On the 5th, they discovered the bandits hiding in a secret cave. Liu Qingyun, the militia captain, led the second platoon of militiamen to capture them. The bandits resisted stubbornly, refusing to surrender. After several minutes of fierce fighting, they lured the bandits into a mountain ditch and captured them alive. In total, they captured Xu Zhende and six of his accomplices, seizing six rifles, one short gun, seven pistol bullets, one overcoat, and one hundred and sixty-five rounds of ammunition. Xu Zhende served as Zhang Bohua's company commander and assault squad leader and was a major culprit in assassinations. Last year, he fired a shot at our district public security assistant and assassinated many of our cadres and civilians. The masses hated him intensely. This time, the masses were extremely happy when the bandit was arrested.
