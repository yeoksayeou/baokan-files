    Longquan Village Employs Poor
    Organizes Ranch to Breed Livestock
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 17th] In the Longquan Village of Qinshui, at the hired peasant meeting on the 25th of last month, everyone felt that there was still a shortage of draft cattle; some households had one animal for every five families, while others had one animal for every three families, which was not enough. The village has wide hillsides with lush grass and water, which is most suitable for animal husbandry. Therefore, everyone unanimously agreed to set up a ranch, but with limited capital, Wang Sanguan, Zhang Hongde, Du Huaiyuan, and others went to the bank to borrow one million yuan. Then, at the Guo Dao meeting, they bought sixty sheep and five donkeys, which were raised by Wu Yongxiang, Wan Kewu, and others. Everyone said, "Raising cows for farming will get us cattle in two or three years, and we will get rich even faster."

    龙泉村雇贫
    组织牧场繁殖耕畜
    【本报太岳十七日电】沁源龙泉村，在上月廿五日的雇农大会上、大家觉着耕牛还缺少，不是五家伙一只、便是三家养一头，不够使用。该村山坡广宽，水草茂盛，最适牧畜，于是大家一致愿意设一座牧场，但是资本有限，王三官、张鸿德、杜怀元等就前往银行贷款百万元，随即在郭道大会上买进羊六十只、驴五头，由武永祥、万克武等分养，大家说：“庄稼养母牛，三年两年牛，咱们发财就更快了。”
