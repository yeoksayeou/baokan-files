　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Sofia News: Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov delivered a speech on November 27th, after the signing of the South-Bulgaria Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, stating: "We have signed an alliance treaty, this treaty enables us to help each other like brothers, build together, share happiness, and jointly resist enemies, to promote friendship and peace in the Balkans, Southeast Europe and the world. Such a goal can be achieved due to the cooperation between the new democratic countries and the Soviet Union in political and economic aspects, and due to the support of the democratic progressive movement in Europe and the world. Our enemies deliberately propagate that a new war is about to come soon, they want to imply to us: it is a waste of your energy and capital to engage in construction so vigorously, a new war is about to break out, and your construction will be destroyed. But our people are fully aware, and we do not believe in this kind of implication. We are always ready to work and struggle, tirelessly creating the welfare of the people. Our cause will surely be victorious. Only those who are neurasthenic will be frightened by this kind of propaganda." Yugoslav Marshal Tito then gave a speech saying: "Imperialism cannot stand our friendship, cannot stand the democracy of our people, our treaty defends peace in this part of the world, and no evil force can hinder us."
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS, Moscow: The diplomatic observer of the News Newspaper recently wrote an article satirizing the American Republican Stassen's request for Truman to declare an economic break with the Soviet Union. The observer said: When Stassen defended the motives for his proposal, he even distorted the fact that the Soviet official representatives had said "the United States is a warmonger." The purpose of this slanderous statement is obvious; Stassen wants to hide behind the broad masses of the American people. But the American people know very well that when the Soviet representatives exposed the warmongers at the United Nations General Assembly, only Stassen demanded "freedom of speech" for them. The American people also know from experience that the crimes of the warmongers not only violate the independence and freedom of other countries, but also violate the independence and freedom of their own country. Stassen's attempt to slander the Soviet Union and slander his own people is bound to be a miserable failure.

　　季米特洛夫斥战贩叫嚣
    南保两国互助共同防御敌人将促进东南欧及全世界和平
    【新华社陕北四日电】索菲亚讯：保加利亚总理季米特洛夫，上月二十七日在南保友好合作互助条约签字后，曾发表演说，略称：“我们签订了同盟条约，这个条约使我们像兄弟般互相帮助，共同建设，共享幸福，共同抵抗敌人，以促进巴尔干、东南欧和全世界的友谊与和平。由于新民主主义国家与苏联在政治、经济各方面的合作，并由于欧洲和全世界民主进步运动的支援，这样的目的是可以达到的。我们的敌人故意宣传新战争很快就要到来，他们想对我们暗示：你们花那么大的力量与资本来从事建设，是白费心力，新战争马上就要爆发，你们的建设都要被毁灭。但是我们的人民是有充分认识的，我们不相信这种暗示。我们时刻准备劳动和斗争，不倦地创造人民的福利。我们的事业一定会胜利。只有神经衰弱的人，才会被这种宣传所吓倒。”南斯拉夫总理铁托元帅继起致辞称：“帝国主义看不惯我们的友爱，看不惯我们人民的民主，我们的条约是在世界这一部分保卫和平，任何恶势力都不能阻碍我们。”
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报外交观察家顷撰文讽刺美共和党人史塔生要求杜鲁门宣布与苏联经济绝交。观察家称：史塔生在为其提议的动机辩护时，竟曲解谓苏联官方代表曾称“美国是战争贩子”。这种污蔑声明的目的是显而易见的；史塔生想躲在美国广大人民的后面。但美国人民深知，当苏联代表在联大揭露战争贩子时，只有史塔生为他们要求“言论自由”。美国人民从经验中也知道，战争贩子的罪行不仅违反他国的独立自由，也违反其本国的独立自由，史塔生污蔑苏联与诽谤本国人民的企图，势必遭到惨败。
