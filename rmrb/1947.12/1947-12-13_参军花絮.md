　　Snippets from Enlistment
　　Who's Pulling Your Dad's Leg?
　　Yang Shangwen from Dongma Village, Neihuang, signed up for the army. When he returned home, his wife asked him, "Did you sign up? What about our little donkey?" Before she could finish her sentence, their eleven-year-old daughter, Airong, interjected, "Mom, are you trying to pull his leg again? If Dad leaves, the masses will help us with the work. What's there to be afraid of?" Airong's mother replied, "Little girl, who said I was pulling your dad's leg? I was just asking if he was going to sell that little donkey. See, you're just a little enlightened one!"
　　I Didn't Know Before
　　Xin Chang’s mother didn't know her son had already signed up. She urged him, "Your nephew joined the Eighth Route Army four years ago. He only came back this year with injuries from the fighting. Xin Chang, you should join the army too, to avenge your nephew! Think about it, what did we eat and wear in the past? What is it like now? You have to fight Lao Jiang!" Xin Chang said, "I've already signed up." His mother said with a smile, "Good, good, I didn't know before!"
　　If You Have a Conscience, Join the Army
　　Zhang Wenjin urged his son, Zhang Kun, "This year in the first month, the KMT army dragged you to the Dazhanglong stronghold and wanted to execute you. They also took a lot of our family's belongings. If you have a conscience, join the army." The next day, Zhang Kun signed up, expressing that he must kill some of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers (according to materials from Dongma Third Village).
　　Brothers Competing to Enlist
　　Li Huatang from Nangaocun, Second District of Nanle, declared his determination in front of the masses to join the army and fight against Lao Jiang. His younger brother, upon hearing this, said to him, "Brother, you should stay at home. You're in charge of finance in the village and can serve the masses. I'm not a cadre in the village; I want to serve the masses on the front lines." As they spoke, the two brothers began to argue. At that moment, Deng Huosheng, seeing them competing to enlist, also said, "I want to invite two others to sign up together." So, Deng Ernian, Deng Shanwen, and three others also joined the army together.
　　Three Brothers, Three Guns
　　Liu Baichang, a liberated peasant from Wuling Village, Fourth District of Puyang, has three sons. The second son has already joined the Weinan Guerrilla Force. This time, when they were mobilized to join the army, he held a family meeting to discuss it. The eldest son and the third son competed to go. The eldest son said, "I have to join the army." The third son said, "If you go, I have to go too. I want to go and eliminate that bad guy, Chiang Kai-shek." The two argued endlessly. In the end, Liu Baichang said, "You two should both go. Three brothers, three guns."

    参军花絮
    谁拉你爹的腿呢？
    内黄东马上村杨尚文，报名参了军，回到家，他老婆问他：“你报名了吗？咱那个小驴怎么办？”她的话还没落地，十一岁的小闺女爱荣便插嘴说道：“娘，你还想拉腿吗？俺爹走了，有群众给咱做活，怕啥？”爱荣的母亲听了，紧接着说道：“小妮子，谁说拉你爹的腿呢？我是问问他那小驴卖不卖？你看，就是你个小开明！”
    我原来是不知道
    心常的母亲不知道他儿已经报了名，便动员她儿说：“你侄子参加八路军四年啦，今年打仗挂了花才回来，心常你也去参军吧，给你侄子报仇！再想想，咱家过去吃的啥，穿的啥？现下是啥时光？你想这，也得和老蒋拼一场！”心常说：“我已报了名啦。”他母亲笑着说：“好，好，我原来是不知道！”
    你要有良心就去参军
    张文进动员他的儿子张昆说：“今年正月，你叫蒋军弄到大张龙据点里，非要枪决你不可，把咱家的东西也弄走很多，你要有良心就去参军。”第二天张昆便报了名，表示非要杀死几个蒋家兵不可（按以上均为东马三村材料）。
    弟兄争着报名
    南乐二区南高庄李花堂，在群众面前表明决心，要参军打老蒋，他的弟弟听说了，向他说：“哥哥，你在家吧，你在村里管着财政，能为群众服务，我在村里不是干部，我要到前方为群众服务去。”说着，弟兄俩就争起来，当时邓活升看他俩争着要参军，也说道：“我也要邀两人一同去报名。”于是，又加上邓二年、邓善文等五个人一齐参了军。
    弟兄三人三枝枪
    濮阳四区武陵村翻身农民刘百长有三个儿子，二儿子已经参加卫南武工队，这次动员参军，他便开家庭会商量，大儿和三儿争着要去，大儿说：“参军我得去。”三儿说：“你去，我也得去，我要去消灭蒋介石那个坏家伙。”两个人争论不休，结果刘百长说：“你们两个都去吧，弟兄三个三枝枪。”
