　　"Do What the Masses Want, Do More of What the Masses Love"
    Licheng Factories Study Winter Business
    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] In order to develop sideline production this winter, make up for the poor harvest, and increase production to support the front lines, the Licheng Trade Union convened a county-wide factory comparison meeting on the 21st of last month. A total of 53 representatives from 44 factories attended. After five days of comparison and experience exchange, based on the achievements of each factory, the Militia Factory, Dongwang Textile Factory, Dananjie Textile Factory, Xinhua Wood Factory, Zheng She Nitrate Workshop, and the Workers' Iron Factory were selected as first-class model factories; Dongguan Wood Factory and five other factories were selected as second-class models; and the Huo Jia Yao Small Factory and six other factories were selected as third-class models. After checking and squeezing out feudalism, the workers' production enthusiasm in each factory was high. After class and current affairs education, the small contract system was implemented, and piecework was paid with work points and dividends, benefiting both labor and capital. Production efficiency was greatly improved. Workers and apprentices broke old conservative habits, taught and learned from each other, and studied and created together, making further progress in technology. The business direction of the factory is to do what the masses need and do more of what the masses love. For example, during the "Hundred Days of Textile Production," the main focus was on making and improving textile tools; at the beginning of spring plowing, the focus was on casting iron ploughs and repairing agricultural tools; when fighting drought and irrigating seedlings, more waterwheels were made; and during wheat planting and harvesting, the two-legged seeding machine was reformed. In this way, they gained the support of the masses, achieved wide sales, and the factories were increasingly consolidated. Based on the exchange of experiences and the principles of sufficient raw materials, large quantities, high quality, low cost, and wide sales, the current work was studied, which mainly includes improving textile tools, making carts, and manufacturing excellent tools. Technically, the slogan "Workers unite and study more" and "Don't be afraid of not learning, only be afraid of getting tangled up" were put forward. To break conservatism, the slogan "If you have martial arts skills, you must pass them on to your apprentices" was put forward. Finally, 18 factories launched a friendly competition. The Huo Jia Yao Small Factory proposed to weave a total of 720 jin of cloth in three months, truly achieving "three not idle" (people not idle, machines not idle, spinning wheels not idle), and competed with the Fifth and Sixth District Cooperative Textile Factory. Zheng She Nitrate Workshop proposed to produce 1,500 jin of good nitrate every month to support the front line, creating experience to promote the entire district. (Chang Qun)

　　“群众要啥咱做啥群众爱啥多做啥”
    黎城各厂研究冬季业务
    【本报黎城讯】黎城职工会，为开展今冬副业生产，补足歉收，增产支援前线，上月二十一日，召开了全县各工厂比选大会，共到四十四个工厂五十三名代表，经过五天的比选交流经验，根据各厂成绩评选出民兵工厂、东旺纺织厂、大南街纺织厂、新华木工厂、正社硝坊、职工铁工厂等六厂，为头等模范厂，东关木工厂等六厂为二等模范，霍家窑小型工厂等七厂为三等。各厂经过查挤封建，工人生产情绪高涨，又经阶级时事两大教育，实行小包工制，按活计工以工分红，劳资两利，生产效率大大提高，工人间、师徒间，打破保守旧习，互教互学研究创造，在技术上也更进了一步。工厂的业务方向是群众需啥咱做啥，群众爱啥多做啥。比如百日纺织中主要多做和改良纺织工具，春耕开始就是投犁铸铁修补农具，抗旱浇苗时多做梢桶，种麦收耕改造两条腿耧，这样得到群众拥护，达到销路广、工厂就日益巩固。根据交流经验，和原料足、数量多、质量高、成本低、销路广的方针，研究了当前工作，主要是改良纺织工具、做大车，制造优良工具等。在技术上提出“工人团结多研究”，“不怕学不会只怕缠破头”的口号。在打破保守上，提出“自己有武艺必须传徒弟”的口号。最后十八个工厂展开了友谊竞赛运动，霍家窑小型工厂提出三个月共织七百二十斤布，真正做到三不闲（人不闲、机不闲、纺车也不闲），和五六两区联社纺织厂竞赛；正社硝坊提出每月要出一千五百斤好硝支援前线，创造经验推动全区。（长群）
