    Old-fashioned Reporting of "Cultivating Three, Remainder One" - Who Holds the Remainder?
    Editor's Note: Comrade Song Jing's question is very important. This kind of "one-size-fits-all" reporting of "cultivating three, remainder one" or "cultivating two, remainder one" is a manifestation of an unstable class standpoint. Both the editors and the authors should examine and correct this.

    Comrade Editor:
    Recently, the reports in the newspaper about "cultivating three, remainder one" have been very unclear in terms of class standpoint. They are still using the same old method of dividing the total output by the entire village population (excluding the targets of struggle) to arrive at "cultivating three, remainder one" or "cultivating two, remainder one." For example, the "History of Fatty Hai and the Cultivating Two, Remainder One of Cui Zhang Village" in the column on the first of last month was vague and generalized in this way. That article mainly described Shi Panghai's leadership, but when calculating the output of his leadership's harvest, it was impossible to see which class had the remainder. The report on the Yuan Dynasty Yang Village's mutual aid and diligent work achieving "cultivating three, remainder one" on the fourth of last month was also the same; it was impossible to see who held the remainder. The news about Guo Jiajie's "cultivating three, remainder one" on the fifth of last month and Yuan Village's "cultivating two, remainder one" on the twenty-third of last month only mentioned the harvest of individual poor and hired peasants. As far as a class is concerned, what was the first autumn harvest like after a year of hard struggle after emancipation? It is impossible to tell. The emancipation of the poor and hired peasants is not thorough enough, and they have no savings. In the case of a general poor harvest, even if we are talking about a village, it is doubtful whether everyone can achieve "cultivating three, remainder one." This kind of generalized calculation method is very inappropriate, and I am specifically raising it, hoping you will pay attention to it.

    Greetings!
    Song Jing

### 老一套的报导耕三余一  余在谁手里？

    老一套的报导耕三余一
    余在谁手里？
    编者按：宋井同志提的问题，很是重要。这种“一锅端”的“耕三余一”或“耕二余一”的报导，是阶级立场不稳的表现，编者与作者均应检讨改正。编辑同志：
    最近报上，对耕三余一的报导，阶级立场很不明确，仍是和过去一样以全村人口（除过斗争对象），除产量就得出耕三余一、或耕二余一。如上月一号辟栏“史胖孩和崔彰村的耕二余一”就是这样笼统模糊，那篇东西主要是写史胖孩的领导，但作为他领导的收获计算产量时，是看不出那个阶层余了的。上月四日元朝杨庄互助勤劳耕三余一，也是如此，究竟余在谁手里？看不出。上月五号郭家碣耕三余一，二十三日原村耕二余一两个新闻中，也只提了个别贫雇的收成，作为一个阶层来看，翻身后经过一年艰苦奋斗的第一个秋收究竟如何？看不出来。贫雇农翻身不够透彻，又素无积蓄，在普遍歉收的情况下，即使以一个村说，能否都达到耕三余一，怕还成问题。这样笼统的计算法，是很不妥当的，特别提出来，希望注意。敬礼！
