    Taihang Administrative Office Directive
    Emphasize Saltpeter and Sulfur Production
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Taihang, 11th] The production of saltpeter and sulfur in the Taihang area has greatly developed in recent years, and has now become a huge income source in the entire rural sideline industry; it has also played a significant role in guaranteeing military supplies. In order to further develop the production of saltpeter and sulfur in large quantities, ensure military needs, and open up avenues for winter production for the masses to make up for poor harvests, the Construction Department of this Administrative Office has specifically instructed leaders at all levels to pay attention to the production of saltpeter and sulfur, and requires leadership organs at all levels to include this work as an important part of production guidance. The instruction states in brief: The production of saltpeter and sulfur occupies a considerably important position in the income of mass sideline occupations, and also plays a significant role in guaranteeing military supplies. Unfortunately, some leading organs still only calculate based on the amount of ash handed over by the masses, without calculating that the income of the workers is also part of our overall income. They have not paid enough attention to this work, so they have not been able to solve the various difficulties currently existing in this work in a timely manner, which has considerably affected the development of the saltpeter and sulfur industry. The instruction also pointed out that in mobilizing the masses to carry out saltpeter and sulfur production, attention must be paid to solving problems such as worker education, training, organizational form, and raw materials. The organizational form should adopt the form of production mutual aid or small cooperatives and cooperative-led management, and further develop saltpeter and sulfur production into a farmhouse sideline organization, widely absorbing a large number of male and female auxiliary laborers to participate, creating mass sideline activities. In solving the difficulty of raw materials (saltpeter soil, ash), all localities should learn from the Lucheng method of planting saltpeter soil, and mobilize the masses to accumulate more soil on sunny days so that they can work on snowy and rainy days. Educate the masses to overcome the simple high-profit viewpoint, and unify the masses' economic interests with the interests of the war, so that the supply of ash and soil does not encounter difficulties.

    太行行署指示
    重视硝磺生产
    【本报太行十一日电】太行区的硝磺生产，近几年来有很大发展，至今已成为全农村副业中一笔巨大的收入；对于保证军需亦起了重大作用。为更大量发展硝、磺生产，保证军需，与为群众开辟冬产的门路，弥补歉收，此间行署建设处特指示各级领导应重视硝磺生产，并要求各级领导机关，要把这一工作列为生产指导的重要一项。该指示略称：硝磺生产在群众副业收入中是占着相当重要的位置，对于保证军需亦起着重大作用，可惜至今还有某些领导机关还只是从群众的交灰上算帐，而不计算工人收入也是我们整个收入的一部分，对这一工作未加重视，因此对目前存在于这一工作中的种种困难，也未能及时解决，相当影响了硝磺事业的发展。指示并指出在发动群众进行硝磺生产中，须注意解决工人教育培养与组织形式及原料等问题。组织形式应采取生产互助或小型合作社及合作社领导经营的形式，并进一步把硝磺生产发展成农家副业组织，广泛吸收大批男女辅助劳力参加，造成群众性的副业活动。在解决原料（硝土、灰）的困难上，各地应学习潞城种硝土的办法，并发动群众好天多积土，以备雪雨天能工作。教育群众克服单纯高利观点，把群众经济利益与战争利益统一起来，使灰、土供应不发生困难。
