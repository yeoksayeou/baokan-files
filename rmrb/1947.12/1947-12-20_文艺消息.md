    The People's Fine Arts Workshop of the Border Region Literary Association started creating many New Year pictures a month ago to welcome the liberated New Year. Currently being printed are "Dividing the Fruits," "Everyone Hates the Traitor Jiang Thief," "Spring Plowing Picture," "Mutual Aid Organization," and leader portraits are also being engraved. These New Year pictures are all six- or seven-color process prints, and a large number will be printed, so that liberated New Year pictures can be widely distributed to the vast rural areas to celebrate the liberated New Year.

    Also: The new yangge opera "Land Returns Home," collectively created by the People's Fine Arts Workshop, has been performed many times in villages and government offices near the Literary Association, and has been well received by the masses, cadres, and cultural workers. It is now being performed in the seventh, eighth, and ninth districts of Wu'an to further solicit and collect public opinion and continue to improve it.

    边区文联人民美术工场，为了迎接翻身新年，在一个月前，就已开始创作了许多新年画。正在印刷的有“分果实”、“蒋贼卖国人人恨”；“春耕图”、“互助组织”，领袖像等也在雕刻中。这些年画，都是六、七色的套版，准备不限数目，大量印刷，务使翻身年画，能普遍散发到广大农村，欢庆翻身新年。
    又：人民美术工场集体创作的新洋片“土地还家”，已多次在文联附近村子、机关演出，颇得群众、干部及文化工作者的好评。现正在武安七、八、九区演唱，以进一步征求及搜集群众意见，继续改进。
