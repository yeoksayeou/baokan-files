    Failing to Prioritize Urgency Delays Production
    Huguan Third District Emphasizes Swift Action
    [This Dispatch from Huguan] The Third District convened a meeting of district cadres on the 27th of last month to study the progress of the current winter production work. Since the district-wide expanded meeting of district and village cadres on November 18th, all villages have generally carried out a large-scale winter production mobilization, raising questions such as "If the soldiers are digging up the old roots at the front, is it okay for the rear to relax?" and "If the front lines are fighting, can the peasants sit down and take the world?" They started with the poor and hired peasants, using accounting methods to get through to the masses. Winter production has now become a movement. After discussion, the current problems and the experiences of solving them are clarified as follows: 1. Focusing on big money and ignoring small money. In the discussion on winter production in Changjiachi, an old man said: "It doesn't matter whether we produce this winter or not. Hauling a load earns more than two hundred yuan a day, enough to eat for a day. It's better to sit at home." Erdan from Dongshanhou said at the cadre meeting: "We are producing this winter, the liberated areas are all producing. It's not that we don't dare to go to the non-liberated areas, where can we earn money!" They all felt that there was no way. Changjiachi and other villages raised the question of "Is it really possible? Can we do it or not?" After discussion and research, most of the masses said: "If the saw rings, sawdust will come out; moving around is money. Even if it's just picking up manure, the seedlings next year will grow well. If we eat outside, saving at home is also money. It is better to work hard!" 2. Complacency and blindness. At the cadre meeting in Shili Village, Zhao Huaibao said: "Our village has achieved a 'cultivate three, surplus one' this year, so there's no problem." Generally, cadres believed that this year's harvest was fast and good, and very tight, so winter production could be casual. They raised the question of "Can we capture Chiang Kai-shek just by fighting at the front? Is our harvest enough to cover expenses?" After discussion, they broke the complacency. From the formulation of winter production plans, it was found that there was blindness in some places. For example, five districts in Shili Village all wanted to open a tofu shop. They immediately asked: "Who are you going to sell it to?" After research, everyone said: "No, we can't do it blindly!" After further research, it was decided that the third district had good hands with high skills, so they could do it. Make the best use of people's talents, let them do what they can do best. From this point of view, breaking blindness is also a major issue in winter production. 3. Only making plans and only dealing with outstanding issues will also affect the development of winter production. There have been many creations and achievements in organization this year, but due to the busy war and a lot of work, there are quite a few outstanding issues. Therefore, the cadres wanted to deal with the issues clearly before production. For example, Beizhang Village let the masses deal with the issues first, which delayed production. Some villages only make plans, and the cadres don't understand what the plan is for, or what the outstanding issues are for. This does not meet the needs of the masses and affects production. The masses demand that cadres actively lead and carry out production, send manure, and construction, etc. Therefore, at present, we must quickly mobilize and organize the masses to produce, formulate plans from action, seek equivalence, and solve problems. 4. Winter production should focus on textiles. In textiles, we must follow the poor and hired peasant line, lead and encourage middle peasants to spin, and strictly control landlords. Now, when we check, very few poor and hired women can weave cloth. In the past, many cadres believed that landlords were both sharp and clever, so that the poor and hired were still oppressed by them. For example, in Nanshanhou, a weaver had to spin one jin of cotton for every jin of cloth she wove, which is no small exploitation. Therefore, implementing the class line, changing the organizational form, and carrying out labor-capital cooperation are the keys to developing winter textiles. 5. The issue of the poor and hired holding power: Due to several cadre hero meetings in the Third District, class consciousness has been somewhat improved, but there are many deviations in thinking and working methods towards middle peasants. Without mobilizing the poor and hired, they insisted on having the poor and hired hold power, regarding the poor and hired holding power as a form and method. As a result, the poor and hired were not mobilized, and some middle peasants felt that being a middle peasant was not very glorious. Chongxian Village Chief and Zhisuo said: "It won't work even if we do a good job here." Everyone researched and recognized: It is certain to deeply mobilize the poor and hired to hold power, but it is also certain to unite the middle peasants to produce well. We must not hate middle peasants in thought and action, so as not to isolate the poor and hired. (Ma Rulong)

    不分缓急就耽误生产
    壶关三区强调迅速行动
    【本报壶关讯】三区上月二十七日召开了区干部会议，研究目前冬季生产工作进行情况。自十一月十八号全区区村干部扩大会议后，各村普遍进行了冬季生产大动员，提出“战士前线刨老根，后方放松了行不行？”“光前方打仗农民能坐了天下不能？”等问题，首先从贫雇入手，用算帐方法打通了群众思想，现冬季生产已形成运动。经过讨论，明确目前还存着的问题及解决的经验如下：一、看大钱不看小钱。常家池在讨论今冬生产会上，一老汉说：“今年冬天生产不生产都行，担运一天赚二百多元，够一天吃，还不如在家坐着好。”东山后二旦在干部会上说：“今冬生产哩，解放区都在生产哩，不是解放区不敢去，钱到那里赚哩！”都感到没门路。常家池等村提出“到底行不行？能干不能干？”经过讨论研究，大部群众都说：“锯响就出末，动弹就是钱，就是拾粪，明年的苗也要长好哩。吃到外边，省下家里也是钱，还是好好干！”二、自满和盲目。十里村开干部会，赵怀保说：“咱村今年达到了耕三余一，不成问题。”一般干部认为：今年收耕又快又好，很紧张，冬季生产就随便吧。提出“光前方打仗能捉了蒋介石不能？咱们的收成够不够开支？”经过讨论，打破了自满。又从订冬季生产计划中，发现有些地方存在着盲目性，如十里村五个小区都要开个豆腐铺，当即提出：“磨出来卖给谁？”经一研究，大家说：“不行，不能瞎干！”又经研究，还是第三小区有好手，技术高，人家开就行了，人尽其材，能干啥干啥。由此看来，打破盲目性也是今冬生产的主要问题。三、光订计划，光处理遗留问题也要影响冬季生产的开展。一年来组织起来有不少创造和成绩，但因战争繁忙，工作较多，遗留问题不在少数，因此，干部想把问题处理清再生产。如北掌村先让群众处理问题，耽误了生产。有的村光订计划，干部不明确计划为了啥，处理遗留问题为了啥，这样不合群众要求，影响生产。群众要求干部积极领导开展生产、送粪、建设等，因此，目前必须迅速发动组织群众生产，从行动中订计划，求等价，解决问题。四、今冬生产应以纺织为中心，纺织上必须走贫雇路线，带领和鼓励中农纺织，严格管制地主。现在检查起来，贫雇妇女会织布的很少，过去不少干部认为地主又利洒又心灵，以致贫雇还受人家压迫。如南山后，织妇织一斤布要纺妇纺一斤花，这剥削就不小。因此，贯彻阶级路线，改变组织形式，开展劳资合作，是开展今冬纺织的关键。五、贫雇掌权问题：三区由于干部英雄几次的会议，阶级觉悟有些提高，但对中农在思想上和工作方法上有不少偏差，没有发动贫雇，就硬要贫雇掌权，把贫雇掌权看作一种形式和方法，结果，贫雇没发动起来，有的中农就觉着当个中农很不光荣。崇贤村长和致锁说：“咱这再干好也不行。”大家研究认识：深入发动贫雇掌权是肯定的，但团结中农好好生产也是肯定的，不能在思想上行动上仇视中农，以免孤立贫雇。（马如龙）
