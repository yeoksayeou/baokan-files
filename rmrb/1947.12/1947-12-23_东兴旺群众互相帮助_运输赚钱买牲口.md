　　Dongxingwang Masses Help Each Other
  　Earning Money Transporting Goods to Buy Livestock
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st report] In Tunliu's Second District, Dongxingwang Village, from the 20th day of the ninth lunar month to the 20th day of the tenth lunar month, within one month, a total of 58 carts were dispatched to transport 30,000 jin of rails, earning 3 million yuan. In order to develop winter production and solve the difficulties of households without livestock, 38 households with livestock, including Shi Guijin and Li Baokui, hired 30,000 jin of rails through Li Baokui on November 15th.  They pre-paid 3 million yuan in cash, first helping 16 households without livestock, including Li Lianchang, to buy 18 head of cattle, spending 1.78 million yuan. They also helped 11 households, including Zhang Qiushuo, to exchange for 11 good livestock, spending 550,000 yuan. They immediately began transportation.  In one month, 58 carts transported 30,000 jin of rails. After deducting the cost of buying livestock and transportation expenses of 2,774,000 yuan, the net profit was 226,000 yuan.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st report] The Tunliu Xicun investigation focuses on the difficulties of hiring the poor.  It organizes the poor for transportation, and plans to buy nine head of livestock for the poor in winter production. The village leadership has begun to pay attention to the production difficulties of the hired poor in winter production. Among the 237 households in the village, 51 head of livestock mostly belong to old middle peasants, and 100 households of hired poor only have 15 livestock, which are also small and thin. For example, five households, including Hou Kuiju, jointly raise one cow. Xi Jiunv just borrowed from here and there to buy a livestock, but it still cannot be used for transportation. Lü Zhengqing turned over and obtained more than 20 mu of land, and wanted to buy a livestock, but because the food and drink for four or five people was not enough, and he had no money, he lost confidence in production. He said: "This winter, I will still pick firewood, and in the spring of next year, I will still be a hired laborer!" Ge Wufu also obtained more than 20 mu of land after turning over, but without livestock, he just gave the livestock wages of two shi and four dou of rice to others, and has not yet paid it off. Five people in the family only have two tattered quilts on the kang. In order to solve the difficulties of the hired poor in winter production, the village leadership held a meeting of all the hired poor in the village on the 12th of this month, officially forming four hired poor groups, so that each hired poor could talk about their difficulties, and then study solutions based on everyone's difficulties. Finally, the hired poor group decided to distribute 1.2 million yuan in loans to 19 hired poor households, including Xue Genwang and Xi Jiunv. Most of the funds were used to buy livestock.  Among them, Qiu Mei, Lü Liangqing, and others were afraid of not being able to repay the loan and did not dare to borrow.  With the specific help of the hired poor group to make production plans, they improved their confidence. Finally, Liu Huzhe, Hou Kuiju and others with transportation experience were selected as group leaders, and a transportation plan was formulated, proposing that each trip should buy one livestock for the hired poor, and by March next year, nine livestock should be bought for the hired poor.  Others with weaker physical strength were organized to open shops and grind tofu.

　　东兴旺群众互相帮助
  　运输赚钱买牲口
    【本报太岳廿一日电】屯留二区东兴旺村，从阴历九月二十到十月二十日一月工夫，前后出动大车五十八辆，运完三万斤铁轨，赚洋三百万元。该村石贵金、李保魁等三十八家喂牲口户，为了开展冬季生产，解决没牲口户的困难，于十一月十五日，由李保魁亲自揽回铁轨三万斤，预支现款三百万元，首先帮助没牲口的李连昌等十六户，买回大牛十八头，用洋一百七十八万元，又帮张秋锁等十一户换成十一头好牲口，用洋五十五万元，当即开始运输，计一月工夫，五十八辆大车，将三万斤铁轨运完，除买牲口与运输盘费用去二百七十七万四千元外，净赚洋二十二万六千元。
    【本报太岳二十一日电】屯留西村调查雇贫困难，组织雇贫运输，计划在今冬生产中，要为雇贫买进九头牲口。该村领导上在今冬生产中，已开始注意了雇贫的生产困难，全村二百三十七户，牲口五十一头大部属于旧中农，一百户雇贫仅有十五个牲口，而且又小又瘦，如侯奎聚等五户才伙养一头牛，席九女刚东抓西借的买到一头牲口，还不能运输。吕正清翻身翻了二十多亩地，想买个牲口，因四、五口人吃喝不够，又没钱，所以对生产失掉信心，他说：“俺今冬还是拾个柴火，等到明年春天还是住咱的长工吧！”葛五富翻身也只得了二十多亩地，但无牲口，光给人家牲口工资米二石四斗，至今还未还清，一家五口人炕上只有两条破被。该村领导上为解决雇贫冬季生产中的困难，特于本月十二日召开全村雇贫会议，正式成立了四个雇贫小组，让每个雇贫都谈自己的困难，然后根据大家的困难，进行研究解决的办法。最后，雇贫小组决定将一百二十万元贷款，分发给薛根旺、席九女等十九户雇贫，其用途大半是买牲口，其中秋梅、吕梁清等怕还不起不敢贷，经雇贫小组的具体帮助作生产计划，才提高了信心。最后选出对运输有经验的刘虎则、侯奎聚等任小组长，并订出运输计划，提出运输一趟要为雇贫买一头牲口，至明年三月要为雇贫买进九头牲口，其他体力较弱的组织开店、磨豆腐。
