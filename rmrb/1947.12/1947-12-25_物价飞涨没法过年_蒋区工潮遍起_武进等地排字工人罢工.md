Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd – According to various reports: As prices skyrocket and the end of the year approaches, labor unrest is widespread throughout the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. Following the Zhengzhou postal workers' strike, postal workers across the entire Chiang-controlled area held a one-day hunger strike on the 9th of this month to protest the Chiang bandit authorities' policy of freezing cost-of-living indices, which leaves the vast majority of employees in starvation. They also demanded immediate improvements in their treatment. The "year-end bonus" demands of Shanghai's citywide employees are facing multiple obstacles under the collusion of the Chiang bandit authorities and capitalists. However, employees forced into starvation will take heroic action to fight for the realization of these demands. In Shantou City, South China, workers at all eleven daily and evening newspapers went on strike together on the 2nd of this month to protest the rejection of their demand for a doubling of wages due to soaring prices. All newspapers were forced to cease publication and were still persisting as of the 5th. Typesetters at various newspapers in Wujin, on the Beijing-Shanghai line, also went on strike from the 20th of last month due to the rejection of their demand for improved treatment. There was still no hope for a resolution as of the 5th of this month. Workers in the Tangshan hotel industry in eastern Hebei once went on strike at the end of last month to demand improved treatment. Workers in the restaurant industry have also made demands for improved treatment, and both situations are currently at a standstill.

　　物价飞涨没法过年
  　蒋区工潮遍起
  　武进等地排字工人罢工
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据各方报导：物价剧涨年关迫近之际，蒋区各地普遍发生工潮。继郑州邮工罢工之后，本月九日全蒋区各地邮务员工绝食一日，以抗议蒋匪当局冻结生活费指数，置广大员工于饥饿之政策，并要求立即改善待遇。上海全市职工之年关“花红”要求，在蒋匪当局与资方勾结下，正遭受多方阻难；但被迫陷于饥饿之职工，将以英勇行动，力争此项要求之实现。华南汕头市全市十一家日、晚报工人，因物价飞涨，要求加薪两倍遭拒绝，于本月二日起一致罢工抗议，各报均被迫停刊，至五日尚在坚持中。京沪线武进各报排字工人，亦因要求改善待遇遭拒绝，于上月二十日起罢工，迄本月五日仍无解决希望。冀东唐山旅店业工人为要求改善待遇，于上月底曾一度怠工，饭店业工人，亦提出改善待遇要求，现均僵持中。
