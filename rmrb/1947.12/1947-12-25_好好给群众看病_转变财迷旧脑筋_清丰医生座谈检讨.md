　　Treat the Masses Well
  　Transform the Money-Grubbing Old Mentality
  　Qingfeng Doctors' Symposium and Self-Criticism
    [From our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 23rd] After the administrative office's health conference decided to establish medical and health organizations in various counties, Qingfeng convened a county-wide doctors' symposium on the first of this month. Well-known doctors from various districts attended. First, everyone reflected on how doctors in the old society only knew how to make money and did not care about the life and death of the masses. For example, Dr. Chen Shuqin from the Second District said: "I graduated from a normal school, and while teaching and practicing medicine, I liked to eat and drink well and looked down on poor people. I also liked to cheat patients out of their money, so outsiders gave me the nickname 'Money-Grubber'!" Dr. Li from the Third District also said: "I became a doctor just to make money. A few years ago, when I went to Shangdi to see patients, I used very little capital to mix some 'Four Elimination Pills' and other things, saying they could cure all diseases, so I made a lot of money." Subsequently, all the doctors frankly reflected on how their purpose in learning medicine and treating patients in the past was to get rich, to be snobbish and put on airs. After reflection, everyone unanimously stated their attitude: they were determined to put down their stinking airs, go to the masses and serve them wholeheartedly. At that time, they shared more than sixty simple, inexpensive, and most effective secret prescriptions, which are to be printed. Finally, everyone decided to establish a medical cooperative in the county.

　　好好给群众看病
  　转变财迷旧脑筋
  　清丰医生座谈检讨
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】行署卫生大会决定各县建立医药卫生组织后，清丰于本月一日召开全县医生座谈会，到会的有各区有名的医生，首先大家反省过去旧社会医生只知赚钱不顾群众死活，如二区陈淑勤医生说：“我是师范毕业，连教书带行医，好吃喝，看不起穷人，又好骗病人的钱，因此外人送号见财迷！”三区李医生也说：“我当医生就是为赚钱，前几年到上堤去看病，用很少的本钱配了些四消丸等，说百病皆治，因此赚了很多钱。”接着，全体医生都坦白反省过去学医看病的目的是发财，嫌贫爱富摆架子。经过反省后，大家一致表明态度，坚决放下臭架子，到群众中去安心为群众服务，当时把很简单、化钱不多、最有效的秘方谈出共六十多样，准备印出，最后大家决议全县建立一个医药合作社。
