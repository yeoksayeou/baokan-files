    Huo County Holds Cadre Meeting Across Systems
    Strictly Criticizing Wasteful Phenomena
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 11th] Huo County convened a county-wide meeting of village chiefs, district chiefs, secretaries, and cadres from industry, commerce, taxation, trade, and banking systems on the 21st of last month. The meeting boldly exposed phenomena that violated the interests of the masses and decided that winter production should be subject to mass inspection and supervision. After conveying the spirit of the winter production movement instructions, the cadres at all levels present sharply exposed the "four quicks" (liquor, meat, cigarettes, white flour) and other bad habits of extravagance and waste in the past. County Head Chen sternly pointed out the facts of various cadres violating the interests of the masses, such as indiscriminate mobilization, indiscriminate enlightenment, indiscriminate apportionment, extravagance, waste, and harboring those who evaded corvée. For example, Shuzhuang mobilized 70 shi of wheat in one instance through threats; Yangzao Village mobilized 15 shi of wheat from a single family in one instance; the entire county mobilized 3,346 shi of wheat; Dazhang Village mobilized 40 quilts, so the masses said: "We are not afraid of anything, but we are afraid of mobilization and enlightenment!" The phenomenon of waste in various villages was also very alarming. For example, when 60 people from Dazhang Village joined the army, they held 70 tables of feasts, spending 114 shi of wheat. Beiguan Village spent more than 1.9 million yuan on five meetings, accounting for 80% of the village's total summer and autumn reasonable burden of military shoes and military cloth. During conscription, Du Village fired 200 volleys of bullets in one breath. For the sake of appearances, Baishang Village exploded 100 stone grenades in a few minutes, fired all the bullets, and then mobilized the masses to buy bullets with wheat. Beihou Village feasted on the fruits of the masses' struggle, spending 60 shi of wheat. In terms of corvée, there was the chaotic phenomenon of sheltering those who were lazy and not keeping accounts, grabbing randomly, and taking care of military dependents without considering their class background or proceeding from reality. For example, in Beihou Village, there were 118 male laborers, but only 12 were assigned to corvée. In Linli, out of four li, only 12 people were assigned to corvée. In terms of preferential treatment for military dependents, some planted over 100 mu of wheat for the entire wealthy military dependent family, while those who raised livestock could not get land to plant, causing some people to sell their livestock. At the meeting, there was severe criticism of the leadership's past emphasis on asking from the masses without actively supporting mass production, as well as the chaotic phenomenon in corvée, which are the main obstacles to developing production. It was proposed to rectify corvée and clear finances, and absolutely prohibit the phenomena of indiscriminate mobilization, apportionment, extravagance, and waste. Based on everyone's opinions, County Head Chen put forward the following guidelines for future efforts: 1. Stop past expenditures and honestly clean up the past. The leadership of this winter's production should be based on hiring the poor as the backbone and handed over to the masses for inspection and supervision; 2. All village expenditures should be directed towards self-sufficiency in production; 3. Strictly implement the financial system; 4. Expand the scope of corvée, with cadres and militia all participating in corvée. Floating personnel and those who are "three-no's" should be registered separately, and the targets of struggle should be assigned to their respective villages to be controlled and labored by the peasants. The preferential treatment for military dependents should be implemented in accordance with the special commissioner's decision; 5. Seize the opportunity to organize all efforts to carry out mass winter production. Immediately, the village chiefs formulated plans, estimating that out of the county's 86 administrative villages, except for a dozen administrative villages in the fourth district that will start self-sufficiency from January next year, the remaining villages will start full production self-sufficiency successively from September, October, and December, without asking the masses for a single grain. They also set plans for each village to gather enough firewood and charcoal for half a year within a month and a half, each woman to spin enough 25 jin of cotton this winter and spring, and each mu to accumulate enough 20 dan of fertilizer.

    霍县各系统干部会议
    严厉检举浪费现象
    【本报太岳十一日电】霍县于上月二十一日召开的全县村长、区长、秘书、工商税务贸易银行各系统干部会议，大胆揭发违反群众利益现象，决定冬季生产要交群众检查监督。会上首先传达了冬季生产运动指示的精神后，到会的各级干部即尖锐的揭发了过去奢侈浪费的“四快”（酒、肉、纸烟、白面）恶劣习气。陈县长严厉指出各种干部违反群众利益的乱动员、乱开明、乱摊派、奢华浪费包庇逃差的事实，如塾庄一次用威胁的办法就动员了七十石麦子；杨枣村一次只一家就动员了十五石麦子；全县就动员了三千三百四十六石麦子；大张一个村就动员被子四十条，所以群众说：“什么也不怕，就是怕动员、怕开明！”各村的浪费现象也十分惊人，如大张村六十人参军，就摆了七十桌席，开支了一百一十四石麦子。北关村开五个会开支了一百九十余万元，为该村全年夏秋屯合理负担军鞋、军布全数的百分之八十。杜村在参军时，一气打完二百排子弹。柏上村为了好看好听，在几分钟内，把一百颗石雷爆炸了，把子弹打过后，再向群众动员麦子买子弹。北侯村把群众斗争果实大吃大喝，花了六十石麦子。在差务上是包庇偷巧不记帐，乱抓一把，照顾军烈属不看成份，不从实际出发等等的混乱现象。如北侯村男劳力一百一十八人，支差的只有十二人。赁里四个闾，只有支差人十二个。优待军烈属上，有的把一家富裕军属全家一百多亩麦子种上了，而喂牲口户种不上，所以弄得有些群众卖牲口。会议上，严厉的批判了过去领导上着重向群众要、没有积极扶植群众生产，及差务上的混乱现象，这是发展生产的主要障碍。提出整差清财，绝对禁止随便动员、摊派、铺张、浪费现象。陈县长根据大家意见，提出今后努力的方针：一、停止过去的开支，要老老实实把过去的清理出来，今冬生产领导应以雇贫为骨干，交给群众检查监督；二、村款开支一律走向生产自给；三、严格执行财政制度；四、扩大支差面，干部、民兵一律支差，流动人员和“三不管”的人，一律分别登记，斗争对象各归各村，由农民管制劳动。对军烈属的优待，按专署决定执行；五、抓紧空隙，组织全力开展群众冬季生产。随即各村长都订出计划，计全县八十六个行政村，除四区十余个行政村，从明年一月开始自给外，其余各村，从九月十月十二月先后开始全部生产自给，不向群众要一粒粮食。并各自订出一个半月内打够半年柴炭、每个妇女今冬明春纺织够二十五斤花、每亩积够二十担肥等计划。
