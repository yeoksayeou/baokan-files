　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Reports from various sources: Dutch invaders, attempting to seize the Indonesian capital of Yogyakarta, have launched fierce attacks on Indonesian military defense zones near Bandung and Cilacap in southern Java. Four divisions of Dutch reinforcements have concentrated in areas such as Purwakarta in West Java. On November 28, Indonesian forces proactively withdrew from Penambinan, the Indonesian air station 85 kilometers southeast of Bandung. Heavy fighting has also occurred in the Ambarawa region of Central Java. Dutch invaders have also engaged in indiscriminate bombing, with destroyed farms and houses in Java alone valued at 1.5 billion guilders. Currently, Indonesian forces are bravely engaging in defensive battles. According to a report from the Indonesian News Agency on the 3rd, twenty trucks carrying Dutch troops, under the cover of tanks, recently passed through Cikampak and Tanjilung in West Java. During their advance to southern Java, they were fiercely attacked by Indonesian forces. The enemy was forced to abandon many bodies and retreated in panic. In the Grut region southwest of Tanjilung, Indonesian artillery fire inflicted heavy casualties on 200 Dutch invaders. For military needs, the Republic of Indonesia is currently constructing a 40-kilometer railway connecting Depok - Cibeuet - Ketanggalaar with its own technology and resources to strengthen transportation links between northern Central Java and the southern Indonesian liberated areas.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Reports from various sources: On the 28th of last month, the Indonesian Republic government sent a memorandum to the Three-Nation "Mediation" Committee, exposing that Dutch imperialism is intensifying its economic blockade and dividing Indonesia into several puppet states, with the aim of excluding the Indonesian Republic from the world. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir, on the same day, issued a statement denouncing the Dutch invaders' conspiracy to militarily demand that Indonesian forces withdraw from all "pocket areas." Sjahrir stated that the Republic's local administration continues to perform its daily duties in these areas, and a large number of Indonesian troops remain stationed there, maintaining contact with headquarters. The Republic will never recognize the so-called "Mook Line" demarcation, and the Indonesian military government in all "pocket areas" will continue to execute the Republic's orders. Sjahrir concluded by stating the Republic's position: First, recognize the Indonesian Republic; second, abolish all separatist movements and dissolve the puppet regimes established by the Dutch in Java, Sumatra, Madura, and other regions; third, the Republic has its own diplomatic representation abroad. Furthermore, according to reports from the Indonesian newspapers "Patriot" and "People's Daily," the "East Indonesia" pseudo-regime, fabricated by the Dutch, is still not recognized by the people of Celebes. The movement led by parliamentarians, headed by Witik, against the Dutch puppet "East Indonesia" government "Chairman" Warouw, is flourishing with the support of the people of Celebes. The "People's Daily" emphatically stated: "The Dutch are powerless to conquer the people of Celebes, even if they resort to force, it will be in vain."

  　印尼军痛击侵略者
    【新华社陕北八日电】各方讯：荷兰侵略者妄图攫夺印尼首都日惹，近在爪哇南部万隆与芝拉扎间，向印尼军防区发动猛攻。四师荷增援部队已集中于西爪哇之布尔哇格都等地，十一月二十八日印尼军已自万隆东南八十五公里之印尼航空站伯南宾主动转移。中爪哇安巴拉哇地区亦发生激战。荷兰侵略军并到处进行疯狂之轰击，仅爪哇一地，被毁坏之农庄及房屋即值十五亿盾。现印尼军正英勇展开阻击战，据印尼通讯社三日电，二十辆载有荷军的卡车在坦克掩护下，于最近曾通过西爪哇之芝甘北、坦其隆等地，在其开赴南部爪哇途中遭印尼军痛击。敌人被迫遗弃许多尸体仓惶败退。在坦其隆西南之格鲁特地区，印尼军炮火使二百名荷兰进犯军遭受重大伤亡。为了军事上的需要，印尼共和国现正以自己的技术和资材赶筑长达四十公里联结德邦——泽布——格当加拉尔间之铁道，以加强中爪哇北部与南部印尼解放区之交通联络。
    【新华社陕北四日电】各方讯：印尼共和国政府于上月廿八日以备忘录一件照会三国“调停”委员会，揭露荷兰帝国主义正加紧实行经济封锁并分裂印尼为数个傀儡国，其目的在于摒弃印尼共和国于世界之外。印尼总理沙利佛丁同日发表谈话，痛斥荷兰侵略者在军事上要求印尼军撤出一切“袋形地带”的阴谋，沙氏称：在该地带共和国地方行政仍执行其日常职务，而且仍有大批印尼军驻于该地与总部发生联系。共和国永远不会承认所谓“穆克分界线”的划分，一切“袋形地带”的印尼军政府继续执行共和国的命令。沙利佛丁最后声明共和国之立场称：第一、承认印尼共和国，第二、取消一切分裂运动，解散荷兰在爪哇、苏岛、马都拉等地区所成立之傀儡政权，第三、共和国对外有自己的外交代表权。另据印尼“爱国者”报及“人民报”消息：由荷兰所一手捏造出来的“东印度”伪政权，至今仍不为西里伯斯人民所承认，以威替克为首的国会议员反对荷兰走狗“东印度”政府“主席”瓦罗苏的运动，在西里伯斯人民支持下正蓬勃开展中，“人民报”力称：“荷兰无力征服西里伯斯人民，即令使用武力亦属徒然”。
