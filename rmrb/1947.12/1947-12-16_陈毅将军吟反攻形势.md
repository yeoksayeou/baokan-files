Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, December 14th: General Chen Yi recently composed a poem titled "The Counter-Offensive Situation," as follows:

　　Millions of banners unfurl and spread wide,
　　Everywhere the Chiang bandits turn to ash and subside,
　　The hollow-shell tactic is now a thing of the past,
　　Where can the key offensives of the enemy last?!
　　From the Jianghan region, news of Liu and Deng's triumph flies,
　　In the Central Plains, Li and Zheng's forces rise,
　　Chen and Xie wield their halberds towards Wan and Luo,
　　Nie and Yang stand tall, threatening the outskirts of Yan and Bo;
　　In Guan and Shan, Peng and He's long-term strategy unfolds,
　　In the Northeast, Lin and Luo's clever arrangements are told,
　　After Tan and Xu's counter-offensive on the Jiaojiao River,
　　On the Su-Lu front, Huaiyin and Huaibei come under pressure.
　　The later generations can observe our grand strategy's art,
　　To this day, planning relies on a heroic heart,
　　The whole nation extols the new democracy,
　　The land reform sweeps like a wild sea;
　　From the South, reports of popular uprisings urgently arrive,
　　Prepare to put Chiang the dictator on trial and deprive!

    陈毅将军吟反攻形势
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十四日电】陈毅将军近作，题为“反攻形势”一诗如下：
    百万旌旗大展开，蒋匪到处变劫灰，空心战术今已矣，重点进攻安在哉？！江汉飞传刘邓捷，中原又见李郑回，陈谢挥戈下宛洛，聂杨立马薄燕台；关陕彭贺长攻略，东北林罗巧安排，谭许胶河反攻后，苏鲁前线逼两淮。后来能兵观远略，迄今筹划赖雄才，举国艳说新民主，土改狂潮遍地来；南天民变羽书急，准备审判蒋独裁！
