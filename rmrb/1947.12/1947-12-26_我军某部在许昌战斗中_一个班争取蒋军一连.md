Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu Wan, 24th: During the Battle of Xuchang, the 3rd Platoon of the 2nd Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) persuaded an entire company of Chiang Kai-shek's (KMT) troops to lay down their weapons collectively without firing a single shot through battlefield appeals. When Liu Huixiang, the leader of the 3rd Platoon, led his entire platoon along a main street in Beimenli for search and advance, they discovered a group of enemy soldiers gathered in a courtyard. Liu immediately directed the entire platoon to prepare for combat, first sending a squad to rush into the gate courageously and hide behind the screen wall. PLA soldier Hao Hongzhou was the first to shout, "Our People's Liberation Army treats prisoners well. Look at me, my home is in Hunan, and I was liberated by the People's Liberation Army last year." Then the whole platoon shouted in unison. The enthusiastic appeals struck the wavering and war-weary feelings of the KMT soldiers. Soon, they heard an enemy soldier in the courtyard reply, "We surrender!" Upon hearing this, the comrades of the 3rd Platoon immediately rushed in and saw that the enemy had already laid down six light machine guns, four carbines, six submachine guns, and more than forty rifles on the ground. When the soldiers picked them up to inspect, some of the guns were still filled with wax, as if they were ready for use.

Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu Wan Frontline, 24th: Zhang Deliu, a discharged soldier who was captured and forced to fight by the Chiang bandit 26th Brigade, killed his squad leader in battle and defected to our army with his weapons. Zhang was originally the leader of the short gun squad of the Chiang bandit 41st Division. Due to a foot injury that left him disabled, he was a street peddler. When our army fiercely attacked the Xinzheng Railway Station, the defending enemy was "panic-stricken" and grabbed men everywhere. Zhang was captured and forced to the front line. When our army fiercely attacked the enemy's fortifications, Zhang immediately killed his squad leader with a grenade, seized two rifles, rushed out of the bunker, shouted "I am not one of them," and defected to our army. The KMT officers and adjutants who followed Zhang Deliu, attempting to escape, were all captured.

　　我军某部在许昌战斗中
  　一个班争取蒋军一连
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十四日电】许昌之战中，解放军某部二连三班以战场喊话，争取蒋匪军一个整连一枪未放集体放下武器。当三班长刘会祥带领全班沿北门里一条大街搜索前进时，发现有一部敌人聚集在一个院子里，刘立刻指挥全班准备投入战斗，先以一个组勇猛扑进大门，隐蔽在迎壁墙下。解放战士郝洪州首先喊话：“咱们解放军优待俘虏，你看我吧，我家是湖南人，我是去年才被解放军解放过来的。”接着全班都一齐喊起来。一片热烈的喊话，句句打中蒋匪军动摇厌战的心情。接着便听到院子里一个敌人回答道：“俺缴枪啦！”三班同志们听了，立即冲了进去，只见敌人把六挺轻机枪、四支卡宾枪、六支冲锋枪和四十多支步枪已经摆列在地下。战士们拾起来检查时，有的枪还象平时一样满满地灌着蜡油。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十四日电】被蒋匪二十六旅抓捕强迫作战之退伍军人张德榴于战斗中打死班长，携械投诚我军。张原系蒋匪四十一师短枪班长，因脚负伤残废，流浪街头做小贩，我军猛攻新郑车站时，守敌“兵慌”，到处大肆抓丁，张遂被抓驱上火线，当我军猛攻敌工事时，张即以手榴弹炸死班长，夺过两支步枪，冲出碉堡，大叫“我不是他们的”，投诚我军。蒋匪官佐紧跟张德榴跑出来，企图逃走，均被俘虏。
