　　Old Bear Carries Night Soil
　　Wang Changqun

　　Yang Kui was an evil landlord tyrant. His family owned more than 300 mu of land, a small part of which was cultivated by hired labor, and he also had more than 200 sheep, employing two long-term workers and two sheep herders. In the past, he relied on his wealth and power to run rampant in the village, and no one dared to provoke him. The masses called him "Mr. Yang" to his face, but behind his back they called him "King Yama" because he ate so much that he became very fat, and later they all called him "Old Bear."

　　When the village began the emancipation movement, Old Bear saw that the situation was not good and opportunistically wormed his way into the cooperative as an accountant. Because the cooperative had few people and a lot of work, everyone was often away from home, sometimes leaving him alone. He took the opportunity to eat and drink extravagantly, wasting the capital of the masses. He secretly deposited his 30,000 yuan into the cooperative, without writing his real name, falsely writing "Wang Taishun" instead, so that everyone could not find it and could not dig out the fruit.

　　Before planting wheat, everyone saw through his trick. After struggle, they squeezed him out of the cooperative. Later, in order to make him do heavy work and taste the pain of the peasants, everyone handed him over to the mutual aid group for control. On the second day of the White Dew solar term, the mutual aid group carried night soil for the military dependent Wang Qinglin, and they also called Old Bear to carry it.

　　There was a fat boy in the mutual aid group, an honest and good young man. As soon as they arrived at Wang Qinglin's house, they all filled seven buckets. After filling them, he said to everyone: "I'll go first, you guys chase me!"

　　After saying that, the fat boy picked up the load and left. After Old Bear also picked up the load, Jin Yu said: "I'll be last, I'll be the tail." Everyone just happened to sandwich Old Bear in the middle.

　　But it was really funny. When others carried the load, they all held the carrying pole with one hand and swayed as they walked, but Old Bear jutted out his two shoulders, bent his back, grabbed the pole with both hands, and swayed his buttocks.

　　At this time, the masses in the village, hearing that Old Bear was carrying night soil, also ran out to see the novelty.

　　The old shepherd Gen Sheng, seeing Old Bear's ghostly appearance, immediately laughed and said to everyone: "Look, look, look at Old Bear swaying, just like an old turtle retracting its head into its shell!" Old Man Gen Sheng's mood at this time felt even happier than when they struggled against Old Bear a few days ago. So, when Old Bear walked in front of him, he said to Old Bear: "King Yama, can you still do this kind of work? Is this what Mr. Yang does?"

　　Before Old Man Gen Sheng could finish his words, he happened to meet a peasant who had worked as a long-term laborer for Old Bear, who also came out to watch. The peasant took up Old Man Gen Sheng's words and lectured Old Bear, saying: "Try it and see if it feels good or not? In the past, I carried manure for you to the south field, twelve trips in half a day, and you still scolded me for carrying it too slowly at noon. Walk faster, carry a few more trips!"

　　Old Bear didn't dare to say a word. The men and women, old and young, on both sides immediately burst into laughter. Nai Hai's mother then lectured Old Bear, saying: "One year, you hired a young boy of eighteen or nineteen to carry night soil for you. You hit the child with the carrying pole, and insisted that the child use a big bucket to carry it. Later, the child got sick from overwork and vomited blood and died. Old Bear, think about how hateful you are." Ugly Hai's grandmother angrily pointed at Old Bear and said: "You are good at beating and scolding people. This is all you are capable of!"

　　Walking out of the village, the fat boy threw Old Bear far behind. Jin Yu then chased after Old Bear and said: "Walk faster, walk faster, look, people have already poured it into the field!" Old Bear felt very uncomfortable and kept begging everyone to let him walk slowly. Jin Yu then said: "Think about your attitude towards the people who carried night soil in the past?" Old Bear replied with a mournful face: "I won't do it again! Peasants are really suffering!"

　　老狗熊担圊
    王长群
    杨魁是个恶霸大地主，家里种三百多亩地，小部分雇人耕种，还有二百多只羊，雇着两个长工，两个羊工。过去他在村上，仗着自己有钱有势，横行霸道，没人敢惹。群众当面叫他“杨先生”，背地都叫他“阎王爷”，因为他吃的很肥，后来都叫他“老狗熊”。
    村上开始搞翻身运动时，老狗熊看形势不好，便投机钻到合作社当了会计。合作社因人少事多，大家经常不在家，有时就剩他一个人，他就乘机大吃二喝，浪费群众资本。并将自己的三万元钱，偷偷的入在社内，也不写自己真名，假造写了个王太顺，使大家找不见，挖不净果实。
    种麦前，大家看透了他这诡计，经过斗争后，将他挤出了合作社。后来大家为了叫他做做重活，叫他尝尝农民的痛苦，便把他交给互助组管制起来，白露节的第二天，互助组给军属王清林担圊，也把老狗熊叫了去，叫他担。
    互助组里有个胖孩，是个老实的好后生。一到王清林家，他就一齐灌起七个＠。灌起后，便对大家说：“我头走，你们撵我吧！”
    说罢，胖孩担上就走了，等老狗熊也担上后，金玉才说：“我在最后吧，当个当尾巴的。”大家恰恰把老狗熊夹在中间。
    可是真笑人，别人担起来，都是一只手捉担，一只手摇着走，老狗熊却是撅着两个肩膀，弯着腰，双手抓着担，扭着屁股摇摆。
    这时，村上群众，听说老狗熊担圊，也都跑出来看稀罕。
    放羊老汉根盛，一见老狗熊那个鬼样子，立刻就笑着对大家说：“快瞧，快瞧，看老狗熊一摇一摆的，好象河里老鳖缩回头一样！”根盛老汉这时的心情，觉得比前些日子斗争老狗熊时还高兴。于是等老狗熊走到跟前时，他又对老狗熊说：“阎王爷，你还会弄这生活？这是杨先生做的事情吗？”
    根盛老汉的话，还没说完，恰遇一个从前给老狗熊做过长工的农民，也出来看，那个农民接上根盛老汉的话，就教训老狗熊说：“你试试好受不好受？从前我给你往南场担粪，半天担了十二遭，你晌午还骂我担的慢，你走快吧，多担上几遭！”
    老狗熊一句话也没敢吭，两边的男女老少，立刻哈哈的大笑起来。乃孩妈紧接着又教训老狗熊说：“有一年来，你雇了个十八九岁的小孩，叫给你担圊，你拿担打伢孩，非叫伢孩用大桶担不行，后来把伢孩足起伤力病，吐血吐死啦，老狗熊你想想你可恶不可恶。”丑孩奶奶气愤的指着老狗熊说：“打骂人，你一个顶好几个，这就尽了你的本事啦！”
    走出村外，胖孩扔了老狗熊很远，金玉便追着老狗熊说：“快走，快走，你看人家倒到了地里啦！”老狗熊觉得使得慌，一直央告大家让他慢走。金玉便说：“你想想你以前对担＠人的态度？”老狗熊哭丧着脸回答说：“我再也不啦！农民就是苦！”
