Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, December 27th: Farmers in fifteen counties in eastern Hubei are universally launching struggles to divide property, grain, and land. Actions have developed from one village to joint actions by several or dozens of villages, and from a few people to hundreds and thousands of organized farmers fighting against local tyrants and landlords. From the northern part of Macheng to the Yangtze River banks of Qichun, Huangmei, and Guangji, an area stretching approximately four to five hundred li north to south, one can see groups of farmers dividing land everywhere. Farmers in Luotian and the Fotashan area east of Macheng are even automatically taking up arms to search for fleeing local tyrants and bullies in remote mountain gullies, and to track down hidden wealth.

During the struggles to divide grain and property, farmers organize poor peasant groups or poor peasant leagues, and establish farmers' associations to preside over the division and equalization of land. Farmers naturally put forward the slogan: "Only large-scale equalization can bring about a great transformation." Eighty-one villages in Macheng County have initially completed the division and equalization of land. In Xiajiawan village, Dongmu Township, Macheng County, farmers divided 23 shi (each shi yielding about 30 shi of rice) of paddy fields owned by the reactionary warlord Xia Douyin in the village among 164 poor peasants, with each person receiving 1.4 dou of land. They also detained Xia Douyin's rent collector. Under the leadership of poor peasant groups and farmers' associations, farmers in Zhijishan completed the equalization of land after seven days of heated discussions, using the village as a unit. In the Qidaohe area of Huanggang, land division was carried out after the division of hidden wealth. A farmers' meeting was held first for discussion, followed by the placement of markers. In less than three days, more than 200 shi of land were distributed to more than 400 landless or land-poor peasants.

After the struggles to divide property and equalize land, the farmers' associations in this area became even stronger, carrying forward their revolutionary tradition of the past twenty years, and holding enthusiastic celebration rallies everywhere. They also automatically organized turnaround work teams of two to three hundred people to help farmers in other areas to turn over. Old baojia systems were abolished, and new village chiefs were elected, with some farmers' association committee members serving as joint village chiefs. The farmers' associations also organized armed self-defense, established an armed forces department and an anti-traitor group within the association, and set up sentry posts. After the great victory at Gaoshanpu, 500 farmers from Tengjiabao district in Luotian traveled more than 200 li in one day to Xishui to receive firearms. Activists carried guns on their backs, saying, "If the Chiang bandits come, we will go to the mountains and fight them!" Farmers in various places also promptly took the lead in rush-planting winter wheat and organizing cooperatives.

During the development of the movement, the landlord class constantly launched counterattacks and sabotage. In addition to spreading rumors and intimidation, some created fake farmers' associations and fake land divisions, some set fire to the houses of farmers' association activists and the rice divided by the farmers, some robbed the property that the farmers had been given, and some used pork and money to buy off farmers' association committee members, carrying out incitement and sowing discord in an attempt to disintegrate the farmers' ranks. But all these counterattacks and sabotage were defeated by the farmers.

　　“只有大平分，才能大翻身！”
  　鄂东农民分财均田
  　地主不断反攻破坏都被击破
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十七日电】鄂东十五个县的农民普遍展开分财分粮和分田斗争。由一个村发展到几个村或几十个村的联合行动，由少数人发展到成百成千有组织的农民和土豪地主作斗争。从麻（城）北到蕲（春）黄（梅）广（济）的长江岸边南北约四五百里地区，随处可见成群结队分田的农民行列，罗田及麻（城）东佛塔山一带农民，并自动拿起武器到偏僻山沟搜捕逃跑的土豪恶霸，追查浮财。农民在分粮分财斗争中，组织贫农小组或贫农团，成立农会，主持进行分田均田，农民很自然的提出：“只有大平分，才能大翻身”。麻城县已有八十一个村湾，初步完成了分田均田。麻城东木乡夏家湾农民把反动军阀夏斗寅在该湾的稻田二十三石（每石收稻谷约三十石），分发给一百六十四个贫农，每人分得一斗四升田。并且把夏斗寅的收租人扣押起来；峙基山农民在贫农小组与农会领导下，以湾子为单位，经过七天热烈讨论后，完成了均田，黄冈七道河地区在分浮财后就进行分田。先开农民大会讨论，然后插标，不到三天，就将二百多石田分配给四百多无地或少地农民。该地农民经过分财分田均田斗争，农会更加壮大，发挥了二十年来的革命传统，到处举行热火朝天的翻身庆祝大会，并有自动组织了二三百人的翻身工作队，帮助外区农民翻身的。废弃旧保甲，选举新村长，有的以农会委员担任联合村长，并由农会组织武装自卫，在农会内设立武装部，除奸小组，建立岗哨。在高山铺大捷后，罗田滕家堡区一天里就有五百个农民从二百多里以外，赶到浠水去领取枪支。积极分子都背起枪来，他们说：“蒋匪要来，我们就上山和他干！”各地农民并及时领导抢种冬麦，组织合作社。在运动发展中，地主阶级曾不断进行反攻破坏，除造谣威吓外，有的制造假农会、假分田，有的放火焚烧农会积极分子的房屋及农民分割的稻谷，有的则抢夺农民分得的财物，有的用猪肉、银钱收买农会委员，进行挑拨离间，企图瓦解农民阵营。但这一切反攻与破坏都被农民击破。
