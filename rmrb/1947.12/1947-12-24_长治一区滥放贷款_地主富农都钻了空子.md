Changzhi District 1 Abuses Loan Distribution: Landlords and Rich Peasants Exploit Loopholes

[This dispatch from the Taihang Bureau of this newspaper, dated the 22nd] The Jinnan Bank's Taihang Third Branch recently inspected loans and discovered that Changzhi District 1 had lent money to landlords and rich peasants, while poor laborers in dire need of production funds did not receive loans. After the autumn harvest, the bank, together with various banks and firms in Changzhi City, jointly organized a rural fund of 331 million yuan, and explicitly stated that loans should be given to poor laborers to help them carry out production and make up for the poor harvest, and that all loans should be distributed through cooperatives and credit unions. However, according to current investigations, many areas have still not distributed the funds to the masses, or even if they have been distributed, they have not truly reached the hands of the poor laborers. For example, Changzhi District 1 was allocated 2.5 million yuan for winter loans, but has not yet withdrawn them from the bank, and 5,235,000 yuan of old loans have not been transferred to the bank. It was not until the county committee urged them on December 9th that they began to conduct inspections. In the inspection of old loans, for example, in Lujiazhuang Village, a total of 655,000 yuan was loaned, 340,000 yuan by the cooperative, 80,000 yuan by Wang Yongze, a bankrupt landlord who tried to sit on two stools (being on both sides), 25,000 yuan by the rich peasant Liu Liancheng, 125,000 yuan by three village cadres (all former middle peasants), and 85,000 yuan by the district's organs for production. Neither the transferred loans nor the new loans were given to poor laborers. The main reasons for this are: 1. Cadres do not pay enough attention to winter production loans and have not mobilized and organized poor laborers into production. 2. Loans are distributed through cooperatives and credit unions. Although the branch bank has transferred the loans to the village cooperatives, it has not promptly promoted and inspected them to ensure that the funds are quickly distributed. As a result, many village cooperatives have accumulated loans and delayed their release, or even misappropriated them, causing the turned-over peasants who urgently need funds to be unable to obtain them, affecting production. 3. Our comrades who distribute loans do not have a sufficient understanding of the class line of lending and still adhere to old viewpoints and old practices. When lending, they first consider repayment ability, emphasizing the purpose and combination of private capital, and the limitation of loan quotas, etc., which ultimately restrict poor laborers.

　　长治一区滥放贷款
  　地主富农都钻了空子
    【本报太行二十二日电】冀南银行太行三分行最近检查贷款，发现长治一区把款贷给地主富农，急需生产资金的雇贫却未贷上。该行在秋耕后，即与长市各银行号共同组织了下乡资金共三万万三千一百万元，并明确提出把贷款贷到雇贫手里，扶助他们进行生产弥补歉收，并将贷款一律通过合作社、信用社组织发放。但根据现在调查了解，还有不少地区仍未发放到群众手里，或虽已发放，但未真正放到雇贫手中。如长治一区，分配到冬贷二百五十万元，现在仍未到银行提取，旧贷的五百廿三万五千元，也没有到银行给转手续，直到十二月九日县委会督促，才进行检查。检查旧贷中如鹿家庄村，共贷款六十五万五千元，合作社贷三十四万元，两头赶上的破落地主王永则贷了八万元，富农刘连成贷了二万五千元，村干部三人（皆系旧中农）共贷洋一十二万五千元，区上的机关生产贷洋八万五千元。转贷与新贷款都未贷到雇贫手里。检查主要原因有三：一、干部对于冬季生产贷款重视不够，没把雇贫发动与组织到生产中去。二、是通过合作社和信用社发放贷款，支行虽将贷款转给了村社，但没有及时进行推动检查，以便把款很快发放下去，因而有不少村社积存贷款迟迟不放，甚至挪用，致使翻身农民急需款却贷不上，影响生产。三、是我们发放贷款的同志对贷款阶级路线认识不够，仍固守旧观点旧做法，在贷款时先考虑偿还力，强调用途和结合私资，以及贷款有贷额的限制等，结果限制了雇贫。
