The Bloody Tempest in Yantai
    Tan Peizhang

    After the Chiang bandit troops occupied Yantai, the first thing they did was to force the citizens to "surrender themselves" and register for seven days. Subsequently, they carried out mass arrests. The total number of innocent people arrested has reached over two thousand. An average of ten people are brutally murdered every day. The Jinde Charity Association collected more than a hundred headless corpses, while the Shandong Road Elementary School held more than a hundred heads without bodies. The cannibalistic and bloody terror of Chiang Kai-shek's fascist beasts has reached an unimaginable level. The coastal road, once teeming with tourists, is now silent. The shore is stained with blood, and as the tide rises, corpses wrapped in sacks float with the waves. A secretary of a Chiang bandit unit confessed: "I killed more than thirty people with my own hands."

    The Chiang bandits' exorbitant taxes and levies also followed their devilish tracks. Taxes like refugee donations, labor service donations, construction materials donations, baojia self-defense donations, and comfort donations force each business to pay around 80,000 yuan (Chiang currency) per day. The total business income of a certain pharmacy for over twenty days was 5.6 million yuan, but the donations and taxes it had to bear were: 50 jin of peanut oil, 50 jin of flour, 150 jin of firewood, over 10 million yuan for refugee donations, and over 12 million yuan for utility pole donations, totaling over 50 million yuan. Its burden exceeded ten times its total business income. The Zhangyu Wine Company, famous in the Far East, was extorted 5 million yuan for utility pole donations in just one day. Arbitrary extortions known to exist include those from Yanfu Company, Deshunxing Clock Factory, and Commercial Bank, among seven large businesses, each extorted as much as 4 million yuan. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang can arbitrarily label them as "Eighth Route Army" members and seal their doors and seize their assets. Hua Feng Store, Tongshun Cigarette Factory, and Ruifeng Flour Company, among others, have been looted. The Yantai Chiang bandit municipal party department established a so-called "Labor Army Movement Committee" on the 5th of last month, preparing for a more thorough plunder.

    The so-called "public buying and selling" of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang is nothing but a deceptive trick of hanging a sheep's head while selling dog meat. In mid-October, there was a severe shortage of peanut oil in Yantai market. The Chiang bandit authorities set the official price at 3,000 yuan per jin, forcibly purchased it from merchants, and then sold it at 18,000 yuan per jin. Merchants complained bitterly and had to hide most of their goods, only using a few minor commodities to maintain appearances. Recently, prices in the city have soared. On the 17th, the prices of various goods suddenly increased by 40% to four times. Corn (i.e., maize) rose from 1,500 yuan per jin to 6,000 yuan. Pure gold rose from 3 million yuan per tael to 4.2 million yuan. Various goods in the city are in short supply. The Chiang bandit authorities have sealed up all the city's timber, preparing it for construction projects. Grain is also under control, and merchants must register all their grain. The Electric Power Company, due to a coal shortage, took coal from the iron factory, which is now only sufficient for two days.

    The Chiang bandit authorities have reorganized the grassroots regime in the city's streets and alleys into a baojia system of special agent rule. The township and town chiefs are all sent from Qingdao, and the heads of the baojia are landlords and despots who have undergone special agent training. Households are organized into five-family mutual guarantee units, where five families are guilty together. They check household registrations at any time, and during inspections, entire families are often arrested. Personnel from the district offices are also filled by "homecoming legions" who commit all kinds of atrocities, including arson, murder, rape, and pillage. Some local thugs formed the "Yantai Baojia Self-Defense Corps," and each township forcibly conscripts 20 able-bodied men for training. The 8,000 police who have already been drawn are used to supplement Chiang Kai-shek's regular army. Due to the victorious development of the Jiaodong people's guerrilla warfare, the Chiang bandit army is extremely panicked and is busy strengthening its defenses. In addition to building bunkers in the tunnels in various districts, they are also building large-scale construction projects inside and outside the city of Suocheng. An airfield has been built on the west square of the West Gouwang Prison, and they shamelessly declare: "We will build projects here for × years, leaving it for the United States to deal with the Soviet Union." The traitorous and harmful nature of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang has been completely exposed. (Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 25th)

　　腥风血雨的烟台
    谭培章
    蒋匪军进占烟台后，第一件事便是强迫市民“自首”，登记七天，随后即进行大批逮捕，被捕无辜群众总数已达二千人以上，每日平均有十人遭残杀，慈善团体进德会共收了一百多个没有了头颅的尸体，而在山东路小学里则放着一百多个没有身体的头颅。蒋介石法西斯野兽吃人的血腥恐怖，到了使人难以想象的程度。过去游人如织的海岸路畔，现已鸦雀无声，岸上血迹斑斑，海潮高涨时，麻袋包扎的尸体随潮浮沉。蒋匪某部的一个秘书自供：“我一手就杀了三十多个人。”
    蒋匪苛捐杂税亦随其魔踪而至，诸如难民捐、出夫捐、修工事器材捐、保甲自卫捐、慰劳捐等等每一商号每天总要被勒索八万元（蒋币下同）左右。某某药行二十几天的营业收入总数为五百六十万元，但它所负担的捐税则有：花生油五十斤，面粉五十斤，木柴一百五十斤，难民捐一千余万元，电杆捐一千二百余万元，合计五千万余元。其负担几超过其营业总额之十倍。闻名远东的张裕酿酒公司，仅一天内即被勒索电杆捐五百万元。而随意敲诈已知者有燕孚公司、德顺兴钟厂、商业银行等七家大商号，共被勒索各达四百万元。蒋家匪帮可以任意给他们戴上“八路”帽子，实行封门清产。如华丰商店、同顺烟厂及瑞丰面粉公司等均遭洗劫，烟台蒋匪市党部上月五日又成立了所谓“劳军运动委员会，准备作更彻底的搜刮。”
    蒋家匪帮的所谓“公买公卖”，更是一种挂羊头卖狗肉的骗人的鬼话。十月中旬，烟市花生油奇缺，蒋匪当局规定官价每斤蒋币三千元，向商民强购后，又以一万八千元一斤出售。商人均叫苦连天，只好将大部货物隐藏，仅以几种次要商品应付门面。最近市内物价狂涨，十七日一天内各物陡涨百分之四十到四倍不等，包米（按即玉茭）由每斤一千五百元，涨至六千元。赤金由三百万元一两涨至四百二十万元。市内各物均奇缺，蒋匪当局已封存全市木料，准备作修工事用，粮食亦实行管制，商家有粮须全部登记。电灯公司因缺煤将铁厂煤炭拉去，现已仅敷两日之用。
    蒋匪当局已把全市街巷基层政权改组为特务统治的保甲制。乡镇保长均由青岛派来，经过特务训练的地主恶霸担任甲长。住户实行五家连保，五家同罪，并随时检查户口，检查时，动辄全家被逮捕。区署人员也均为烧杀奸淫无恶不作之“还乡团”充任，一些地痞流氓，则组成“烟台保甲自卫团”，每乡又强征壮丁二十名集训，已抽的八千名警察，则被用以补充蒋匪正规军。由于胶东人民游击战争之胜利开展，蒋匪军极为恐慌，忙于加强防务，除在各区地道修堡外，另在所城内外大筑工事，西沟旺监狱以西广场上已修筑机场一处，并恬不知耻地公然宣称：“我们在这里修×年工事，留给美国对付苏联”。蒋匪卖国贼祸国殃民真面目，已暴露无遗。（新华社山东二十五日电）
