Xiyang County Cooperative

Helping the Masses Find Ways to Make a Living

[Our newspaper's Xiyang dispatch] In order to support the masses in developing winter production, the County Cooperative, based on the needs of the masses, actively sought out avenues for production. The masses reflected, "Transportation is not profitable because expenses are too high. Transporting coal from Xiyang to Xingtai barely covers the expenses, leaving no profit." In response, the County Cooperative established a fire station and a coal station in Xingtai, and a coal station in Shunjiacun. The transporting masses can stay at our own stations, eat home-cooked meals, save money, and stay healthy. The coal they transport will be purchased by the station, ensuring they don't sell it for less. In addition, the Cooperative organized the masses to transport iron pots, paying 100 yuan per jin for freight. Each donkey can carry an average of 120 jin, earning 12,000 yuan for a seven-day round trip. The plan is to transport 120,000 jin of iron pots, which will generate 12 million yuan, resolving the transportation needs of 1,000 livestock this winter. To ensure that the masses have cargo for the return trip, the Cooperative decided to purchase 120,000 jin of sea salt in Xingtai, paying 30 yuan per jin for freight, totaling 3.6 million yuan. Each donkey can carry an average of 120 jin, earning 3,600 yuan. Thus, one round trip can earn 15,600 yuan. The two combined can generate 15.6 million yuan, solving the difficulties faced by the masses such as a lack of outlets, high expenses, and low profits. To vigorously support textile production and address the clothing difficulties of the masses, the Cooperative decided to convert dead assets into living assets, and mountain products into cotton, exchanging local mountain products (mainly melon seeds) for cotton. It was decided that 2,000 jin of cotton could be exchanged for 20,000 jin of melon seeds, transporting them from Xiyang to Xingtai, with a freight cost of 100 yuan per jin of melon seeds, totaling 2 million yuan. To save manpower, the exchange is first carried out through village and district cooperatives, allowing the masses to exchange melon seeds for cotton locally. This not only provides an outlet for local mountain products but also resolves the masses' difficulties in obtaining textile raw materials, while also supporting the development of transportation. To support hired and poor laborers and involve them in the winter production campaign, the Cooperative allocated 50 shi of wheat to organize hired and poor laborers near Chengguan to grind flour. Every four laborers can grind 100 jin of wheat per day, yielding 80 jin of refined flour and 18 jin of bran. The Cooperative actually receives 75 jin of flour, and the four laborers earn 5 jin of flour and 18 jin of bran per day, with each laborer earning an average of 915 yuan per day. Fifty shi of wheat can generate a total of 29,300 yuan. Currently, efforts are being made to organize the masses to carry out this campaign. (Mang Xiao)

　　昔阳县联社
  　帮助群众找门路
    【本报昔阳讯】县联社为扶植群众开展冬季生产，根据群众要求，积极为群众找生产门路。群众反映说：“运输不赚钱，原因是盘费过重，昔阳驮炭到邢台，除盘费赚不到红利。”这时县联社便到邢台设起火店、炭站各一座，顺家庄设炭站一座，运输群众下去到自己店房，可以吃家常饭，省钱又耐饥，所驮下之炭，由站负责收买，这样不会少卖钱。另外，组织群众驮锅，每斤脚价一百元，每头驴平均驮一百二十斤，一次往返七天可赚洋一万二千元，计划驮铁锅十二万斤，可赚洋一千二百万元，能解决今冬一千头牲口运输。为使群众有回脚驮，该社决定在邢台购买海盐十二万斤，每斤脚价三十元，共脚价三百六十万元，每头驴平均驮一百廿斤，可赚洋三千六百元，这样往返一次可赚洋一万五千六百元。两种总共可赚洋一千五百六十万元，解决了群众的没销路、盘费大、不赚钱等困难。为大力扶植纺织，解决群众穿衣困难，该社决定以死物变活物，以山货变棉花，把本地土产山货（主要是瓜籽）换成棉花。决定以二千斤棉花可换瓜籽二万斤，从昔阳运往邢台，每斤瓜籽脚价一百元，共脚价二百万元。为节省民力，首先通过村、区联社代换，使群众在当地就可以拿瓜籽换到棉花。这样，既能把本地土产山货给群众找到了出路，又能解决群众的纺织原料困难，同时，也扶植了运输的开展。为扶植雇贫辅助劳力，使他们同样卷入冬季生产运动，该社抽出五十石麦子，组织城关附近的雇贫辅助劳力磨面，每四个辅助劳力每天可磨麦一百斤，出净面八十斤，出麸十八斤，社里实收面七十五斤，四个辅助劳力一天可赚面五斤，麸十八斤，每个辅助劳力每天平均赚洋九百十五元。五十石麦，共可赚洋二万九千三百元。现正全力组织群众开展这一运动。　　　（忙小）
