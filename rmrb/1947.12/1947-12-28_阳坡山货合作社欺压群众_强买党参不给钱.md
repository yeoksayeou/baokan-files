Yangpo Mountain Products Cooperative Oppresses the Masses
Forcibly Buys Codonopsis and Doesn't Pay

[This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] The mountain products cooperative jointly run by the Yangpo Cooperative in Dalinggou, Fourth District, Qianwu Cooperative in Fifth District, and Hongtai Freight Forwarder in Licheng County, is nominally for solving the people's difficulties and regulating rural materials, but in reality, it has become an organization for ruling the peasants. There are many mountains and little land there, and this year's harvest is also bad. Most of the masses rely on digging slopes, planting Codonopsis, and digging medicinal materials to make a living. They have worked hard all year round, and in the autumn, they really hope to sell Codonopsis to buy rice and cotton clothes. However, under the rule of this cooperative, farmers cannot freely sell their goods. If someone sells without going through the cooperative, they will be criticized. Therefore, without the approval of the cooperative, no farmer dares to sell freely. All the Codonopsis is sold to the cooperative, but it has been four months now, and they still haven't received the money. Especially the peasants who have just been liberated have no savings and the autumn harvest was poor. They urgently need money but cannot get it. For example, Wang Lao Han from Bangchuiyan, Dalinggou, has a family of three. His son has joined the army, leaving the old man and his daughter-in-law at home. He dug up more than 400 catties of Codonopsis, all of which was sold to the cooperative. He really hoped to sell the Codonopsis to get through the season, but he still hasn't received the money, and the old man and his daughter-in-law are spending the winter in single clothes. Another example is Wu Jianlu from Qianwu Village, who sold more than 400 catties of Codonopsis, worth more than 500,000 yuan, and bought a three-room house for 488,000 yuan, hoping to use this money. Unexpectedly, when the payment was due, it was difficult to get the price of Codonopsis, and he had no money to pay, so he had to return the house to the original owner, losing 90,000 yuan. Shi Zhenghe from Dalinggou sold more than 100 catties of Codonopsis, worth more than 90,000 yuan. At the time of selling the Codonopsis, each dou of corn was worth 1,300 yuan, which could buy more than seven shi of corn, but now the money has not been received. Now each dou of corn costs 2,800 yuan, which can only buy more than three shi of corn. Shi Zhenghe is very anxious and doesn't know when he will get the money. On the 28th of last month, an old man from Qianwu Mountain was going to the market in Nanweiquan, wearing a tattered coat and single trousers. Someone asked him, "Why are you still wearing single clothes at this time?" The old man said with tears in his eyes: "I didn't harvest any grain, and I dug up 300 catties of Codonopsis. The cooperative wouldn't let me sell it outside, but told me to sell it to them. When the time came, I couldn't get the money. Once I asked them for money, and they scolded me, saying, 'We have tens of millions of yuan in business, how could we possibly owe you?' I went to them again, but not only couldn't get the money, but I couldn't even find them." According to the farmers in the area, the cooperative owes more than 6 million yuan to the whole valley. Because farmers go to ask for money every day, the cooperative has closed its doors and moved to Handan. Poor farmers not only can't get the money, but they can't even find the people. So far, these problems have not been resolved.

　　阳坡山货合作社欺压群众
  　强买党参不给钱
    【本报黎城讯】黎城县四区大岭沟阳坡合作社、五区千午合作社、以及宏泰货栈，三家合办的山货合作社，名义是为了解决人民困难，调剂农村物资，而实际成了统治农民的机构。那里山多地少，又加今年的年景不好，大部群众都依刨坡、种党参、刨药材等过活，一年来辛辛苦苦种刨，秋后实指望卖党参籴米、穿棉衣，但在该合作社的统治下，农民不能自由出卖。如有人不经合作社出卖时，就要受批评，因此农民不经合作社批准，谁亦不敢自由出卖，所有的党参，都卖给合作社，至今时隔四个月，还要不上钱。尤其是刚翻身的农民，家无积蓄，又加秋景歉收，急想用钱拿不上。如大岭沟棒锤堰王老汉，家有三口人，儿已参军，家留翁媳二人，刨下四百余斤党参，全数卖给合作社，实指卖党参换季，但至今要不了钱，翁媳穿着单衣过冬。另有千午村吴建禄卖党参四百余斤，合洋五十余万元，买下三间房价洋四十八万八千元，指望用这钱，不料到期参价难要，无款可交，无奈把房仍退原主，倒赔洋九万元。大岭沟石正和卖党参百余斤，合洋九万余元，按卖党参时每斗玉茭一千三百元，能籴玉茭七石多，刻下钱仍未要上。现在每斗玉茭二千八百元，只能籴玉茭三石多，石正和非常发急，钱还不知何日才能要上。上月二十八日，千午山上的一个老汉在南委泉赶集，身穿破袄单裤。有人问他，你为什么这时候还穿单衣？老汉两眼泪落的说：“粮食没打下，刨上三百斤党参，合作社不叫往外卖，叫卖给人家，到时要不上钱，有次和人家要钱，叫人家训了一顿说：‘我们几千万元的生意，难道还短下你们的不成？’又去找不但要不了钱，连人亦找不见啦。”据该地的农民反映，全沟统计该合作社的欠款，在六百余万元，因每天有农民前去要钱，该合作社全部闭门，搬至邯郸，贫苦农民不但要不了钱，连人亦找不见了，至如今这些问题仍没有结果。
