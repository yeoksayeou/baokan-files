    Jilu Yu No. 9 Military District
    Training Rural Performers
    Reforming Outdated Propaganda
    [Report from our newspaper in Jilu Yu, 15th] The No. 9 Special District Commissioner's Office recently established a training class for rural performers from Fan County, Shou Zhang, Yanggu, and Nanfeng counties. Initially, each trainee held different ideas. After the class began, through speaking bitterness sessions, they realized that receiving training was a good thing. It was to reform and elevate the "lowly" actors and musicians that people had seen for years. [It was] to stop them from doing propaganda with feudal superstitions for the landlord class and to use this art properly to serve the people. At the end, all 108 members of the class, representing 33 troupes, issued a letter to all old performers in the border region. The letter emphasized that this training had improved their awareness and refreshed their minds. It also called on all old performers in the border region to organize and unite, to fully support the great counter-offensive, to thoroughly defeat Chiang Kai-shek, to completely eliminate the landlord ruling class, to resolutely stand on the side of the masses, and to take the road of new democratic new culture. It was also meant to change the "enmity" in the past saying "competitors are enemies" into "unity," and to break the old troupes' sectarianism, jealousy, and bad practices of attacking others to elevate oneself. Before the trainees left the school, the Special District Commissioner's Office held a forum in Nanfeng, with more than 60 people participating, including the border region's cultural troupe, art union, literary union, and the heads of the cultural and educational sections of the counties under the No. 9 Special District Commissioner's Office. The main goal was to summarize the drama movement activities of the past three months, solve the difficulties of various troupes, and point out the future direction of the drama movement.

    Also, the No. 2 Special District Commissioner's Office, in order to carry out New Year propaganda and rural cultural activities, held a training class for performers from Yuncheng, Yunbei, Yunge, and Juye counties, which began on the 6th of this month. It was divided into four classes: drama, storytelling, fine arts, and music, with a total of more than 150 people.
