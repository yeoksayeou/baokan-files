　　Correcting Coercion and Waste

    This conscription movement, based on the awakening of the broad masses of liberated peasants, especially poor and landless peasants, has sparked a wave of conscious and voluntary participation in their own class army. High ideological awareness and good quality are very prominent features. However, on the other hand, it cannot be ignored that in this conscription movement, unscrupulous methods to complete tasks, coerced voluntarism, and even forcibly dragging and pressing people into service still exist seriously and are quite common. Even in places where "self-reporting" was publicized in the newspapers, such as Wu'an (see this newspaper's message on the 28th of last month), the facts are not entirely consistent. In several villages in the county, there are still serious phenomena of coercive orders.

    No matter what form coercion takes, it will certainly lead to bad results and deserves review and correction. Over the years, there has been a popular misconception about conscription work, believing that conscription must be accompanied by some degree of coercion, with so-called fallacies such as "first coercion, then voluntarism," "combination of coercion and voluntarism," etc. This has led to impatience in carrying out ideological mobilization and the adoption of simple methods. The reason why these ideological styles arise is because they consider problems from the perspective of those above the masses, and they are a manifestation of disbelief in the masses, which must be eliminated. Some places have not truly organized and mobilized the active elements of the masses, and still assign the task of conscription to village cadres who are unwilling to join the army themselves and only want others to join, which inevitably leads to the phenomenon of coercive orders.

    The phenomenon of waste in the conscription movement is related to coercive orders. In many places, village cadres on the one hand force young people to join the army, and on the other hand order the masses to "comfort" them, trying to create a "surge of enthusiasm" to cover up their mistakes. This phenomenon should also be strictly prohibited and corrected. The refusal of donations by new soldiers in the Sixth District of Puyang is a manifestation of the high degree of awareness of the liberated peasants and deserves commendation.

　　纠正强迫与浪费
    这次参军运动，在广大翻身农民，特别是贫雇农觉悟的基础上，掀起了自觉自愿参加自己的阶级部队的热潮。思想高，质量好，是一个非常显著的特点。但另外一方面，也不容忽视，即在这次参军运动中，为完成任务不择手段，强迫自动，甚至硬攀硬逼等强迫命令的不良作风仍然严重存在，而且相当普遍。即在报上登出“自报”的地方，如武安（见本报上月二十八日消息），和事实也并不完全一致，该县若干村庄，还存在着严重的强迫命令现象。
    不管强迫命令是以什么形式出现的，它都一定会造成不好的结果，都值得检讨与纠正。历年来对参军工作流行着一种错误想法，认为参军一定多少要带些强迫，有所谓“先强迫，后自愿”，“强迫与自愿结合”等谬论。这就造成不耐心的去进行思想动员，而采取简单方式。这些思想作风之所以产生，是站在群众头上考虑问题，是不相信群众的表现，必须加以肃清。有些地方并未真正组织与动员群众积极分子，仍把参军任务交给了自己不愿参军，只想别人参军的村干部，以致造成强迫命令现象，那是必然的了。
    参军运动中的浪费现象，是与强迫命令相联系的，许多地方，村干一方面强迫青年参军，同时又命令群众“慰劳”，想借此制成“热潮”，掩盖自己的错误。这种现象也应严加制止和纠正。濮阳六区新战士拒受捐款，是翻身农民高度觉悟的表现，值得予以表扬。
