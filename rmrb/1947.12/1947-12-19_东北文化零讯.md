    ▲The Soviet play "The Russian Question" by Simonov, winner of the Stalin Prize, has been translated and published by the English Research Association here, and performed by the Songjiang Cultural Troupe in Harbin. The play depicts "why" and "how" the American imperialist capitalists and warmongers carry out anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities, and incite new war propaganda. It was very popular with the audience.
    ▲The Northeast Film Studio's new productions, "Democracy in the Northeast" (Fourth Collection) and the puppet show "The Emperor's Dream," have also begun screening in Harbin. The former depicts the greatness of the working class and peasant forces in the liberated areas, and the abundance of Northeast resources. The latter depicts the ugliness of Chiang Kai-shek and the US, and the "Grand Inauguration" staged by their lackeys, the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, is just a dirty "emperor's dream."
    ▲The Heilongjiang Provincial Lu Xun Arts and Crafts Troupe has been performing plays such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Anti-Overturning Struggle," "Joining the Army," and "Good Work" in the countryside for the past month. People from all over the villages, carrying dry rations, come from twenty or thirty miles away to watch. When performing "The White-Haired Girl" in Linkou County, the masses shouted: Execute the big-bellied Huang Shiren and the lackey Mu Renzhi, and the emotions were extremely agitated.
    ▲The Second Northeast Art and Literature Work Troupe has recently created a large number of Yangko dances, living newspapers, and songs, which are performed on the streets of various towns. The works are compiled from actual materials collected from various places, and are very popular with the masses.
    ▲Songjiang Provincial No. 1 Normal School has been renamed "Xingzhi Normal School" to commemorate the people's educator Tao Xingzhi, and to promote his educational methods.
    ▲Since its establishment this spring, the Northeast People's Theater in Harbin has focused on reforming old artists, and, led by translator Jin Ren and others, has engaged in the transformation of old operas. Some adaptations of old operas such as "Daughter of Heaven" and "Madam White Snake" are still in line with the current ideological sentiments of the masses.
    ▲The Qiqihar Municipal Northeast People's Theater recently carried out a movement of speaking bitterness and confessing, and male and female actors have revealed the crimes of the old owner Liu Shaoen.
    ▲The General Political Department Art Troupe of the Democratic Allied Army has been working in depth in the companies and newly recovered areas, and recently performed the two-act Yangko opera "Meritorious Service for Courage" (a chronicle of the meritorious service movement of the troops) and "The Death of Zhang the Tailor" (recording the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Xi'an) in Harbin, which were highly praised by the audience.
