By dawn, both strongholds were completely captured by our forces, and the entire defending Yan bandit Ninth Column was annihilated. 26 enemy soldiers, including and below the rank of company commander, were killed or wounded, and 44 were captured alive.

During the battle, enemy forces from Menggao and Rencun attempted to provide reinforcements but were repelled by our forces.
