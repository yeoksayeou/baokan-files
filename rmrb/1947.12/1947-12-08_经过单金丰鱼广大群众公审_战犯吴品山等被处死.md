　　This newspaper's dispatch from the Fifth Region of Ji-Lu-Yu [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] on the 5th: The broad masses of Dan (County), Jin (Xiang), Feng (County), and Yu (Tai) held a public trial in front-line gatherings for war criminal and traitor Wu Pinshan and other four chief culprits, and executed them amidst the angry indignation of the masses. Wu Pinshan was the puppet security commander and county magistrate of Yutai. Ding Kuishan was the deputy regiment commander under him. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they willingly served the enemy. During the Self-Defense War, they were again the henchmen of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, committing all kinds of atrocities, including harming, looting, and raping. In Huangdui District of Dan County, more than 200 head of cattle were taken away in a few months. In Caozhuang, 16 head were taken away in one month. Since Wu Pinshan ruled Yutai, no fewer than three to four thousand martyrs have suffered directly or indirectly under his persecution. The number of women raped is countless. He often dragged young women into Yutai city, raped them, and then forced the masses to redeem them with grain. War criminals Wang Xiangzhu and Wang Dechao were both special agents. Farmers who were arrested and brought into Yu city were all "interrogated" by them. If they were not buried alive, they were locked in dry or water prisons. When we liberated Yutai, the local people were extremely excited and unanimously advocated a public trial for revenge. At the meeting, the fighting at the front was fierce, and enemy planes disturbed the meeting from time to time, but the masses still came from dozens of miles away to participate. During the recounting of suffering, an old blacksmith was so angry that he couldn't say anything, so he took off his shoes and hit the war criminals on the head. After the victims tearfully recounted their grievances, the audience shouted, "His crimes are all obvious, he must pay with his life!" "Sentence him to death!" Thus, in the shouts of revenge, they were executed one by one.

　　经过单金丰鱼广大群众公审
    战犯吴品山等被处死
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】（金乡）、单（县）、丰（县）、鱼（台）广大群众，在前线集会公审战犯吴逆品山等四罪魁，在群情怒愤下处决。吴品山是鱼台伪保安司令兼县长，丁奎山是他手下的副团长，他们在抗日战争中，甘心事敌，自卫战争中又为卖国贼蒋介石的爪牙，残害、抢掠、奸淫无所不为，单县黄堆区数月内，就被拉去二百多头牛，曹庄在一个月内，被拉去十六头。自吴品山统治鱼台以来，在其直接间接残害之下，被难烈士不下三四千人。而妇女被奸淫者，更不计其数，常把青年妇女拉进鱼台城，奸淫后还要群众用粮食去赎。战犯王向筑、王德超都是特务，被抓进鱼城的农民都经过他两个“审理”，不活埋就是关进旱牢或水牢。该四犯于我光复鱼台时被俘，当地人民兴奋异常，一致主张公审复仇。开会时，前方战斗正烈，匪机不时扰乱，群众仍从数十里外赶来参加。在诉苦时，一个打铁老人气得啥也说不出来，就脱下他的鞋子，向战犯头上打去。苦主一字一泪的哭诉后，台下喊起来：“他的罪恶都是摆着的，要他偿命！”“治死他！”遂在报仇雪恨的喊声中，把他们一个个处死。
