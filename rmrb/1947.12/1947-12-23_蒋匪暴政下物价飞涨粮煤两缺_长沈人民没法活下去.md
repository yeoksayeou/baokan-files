Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to reports from various sources, the people in the Chiang-controlled areas of Northeast China are trapped in a desperate situation of hunger and cold under the tyrannical rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In Shenyang, due to a severe coal shortage, electricity was completely cut off on the 8th of this month. By the 9th, all newspapers in the city had ceased publication. Prices are soaring. Sorghum rice costs more than 600 yuan per pound (circulation currency, same below), and rice costs more than 800 yuan per pound. Coal, considered a rare commodity, has risen to 350,000 yuan per ton. Poor people are freezing and starving to death on the streets every day. The number of beggars along the streets in the northwest wind is countless. Teachers in primary and secondary schools in various places often parade and petition in the streets because they cannot maintain their livelihoods, while students are forced to sell newspapers part-time. The Shenyang Private University and Middle School Student Union told reporters last month, "The (Chiang Kai-shek) authorities have stopped distributing grain and coal. The students' food expenses have risen from nearly 30,000 to 70,000 yuan. Next month (referring to this month), the school's catering groups will run out of food." Even Mao Wenwei, the chief of the Chiang Kai-shek police bureau, admitted, "The current monthly salary of ordinary police officers is 18,000 yuan, but the minimum monthly food expense for each person is 40,000 yuan. Therefore, police officers go out to drive pedicabs to earn a living after work." Zhang Chengfu, a policeman from the Chiang Kai-shek Seventh Branch, has a family of five, and his wife and daughters often go out to beg for food. Changchun has no coal at all, and the power plant has been forced to prepare to use bean cake instead of fuel for power generation. At the end of October, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities sealed up more than 2,400 shops in the city under the pretext of "unregistered," and citizens discussed, "Anyway, they will be closed sooner or later, who will give him (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang) so many 'handling fees'!" Since the beginning of winter, rice and firewood grabbing incidents have occurred frequently in Changchun, and the Chiang Kai-shek military police have taken a bystander attitude. Due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's exorbitant taxes and levies, tragedies continue to occur in the city. In the middle of last month, a cart driver was arrested by the Chiang Kai-shek New First Army to pull things. After pulling, the cart was detained, and his family could not survive, so he hanged himself. Another elementary school teacher named Liang was so hungry that his family had no choice but to write "Chiang Kai-shek's Virtuous Government" on the stove in grief and indignation and cried behind closed doors. It is even more difficult to count the number of ordinary people who cannot cook for days. A folk song is popular among the citizens: "Changchun is in complete darkness, the New First Army dares not move, if the people want to see the light of day again, they have to wait for the Liberation Army."

　　蒋匪暴政下物价飞涨粮煤两缺
  　长沈人民没法活下去
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据各方报导：东北蒋区人民在蒋家匪帮暴政统治下，陷于饥寒交迫之绝境。沈阳本月八日因煤荒严重，电力完全断绝供应。至九日全市报纸均已停止出版。物价飞速上涨，高粱米每斤须六百元（流通券，下同）以上，大米每斤八百余元，视为奇货的煤每吨已涨到三十五万元。街头每天都有穷人冻饿而死。西北风里沿街求乞者，更难以数计。各地中小学校教员因维持不了生活，常在街头游行请愿，学生则被迫兼卖报纸。沈阳私立大中学同学会上月招待记者称：“（蒋匪）当局停止配售粮煤，同学伙食费近已由三万升至七万元，下月（指本月）各校，伙食团将断炊。”甚至蒋匪警察局长毛文位亦供认：“普遍警察现月薪为一万八千元，但每人每月最低伙食费却须四万元。所以警察一下班就去蹬三轮车赚钱糊口。”蒋匪七分局警士张成富一家五口，妻女常出外讨饭。长春已根本没煤，电厂已被迫准备以豆饼代替燃料发电。十月底蒋匪当局借“未经登记”为名查封市内商号达二千四百余家，市民纷纷议论：“反正迟早要关门，谁还送给他（指蒋家匪帮）那么多‘手续费’！”入冬以来长春市内抢米抢柴风潮时有发生，蒋家军警均抱旁观态度。由于蒋匪横征暴敛，市内惨剧不断发生，上月中有一马车夫被蒋匪新一军抓去拉东西，拉完后，车被扣留，他一家无法生活，遂自缢身死。另有小学教员梁某者，一家人饿的没办法，悲愤至极，遂在灶头上写“蒋家德政”四个大字，闭门痛哭。一般平民几天不能举炊的更难以胜数。市民中流行着这样的民谣：“一片漆黑的长春，不敢动的新一军，百姓要想再见天，得等来了解放军。”
