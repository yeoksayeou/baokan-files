　　Jinnan Local Armed Forces Advance to the South Bank of the Zhang River
    Valiant Protection of Grain on the Periphery of Anyang
  　Annihilating Over Three Hundred and Seventy Bandits in One Month
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jinnan Military Region's local armed forces have advanced to the south bank of the Zhang River, on the periphery of Anyang, bravely protecting the grain. From October 18th to November 18th, in one month, they killed, wounded, and captured 266 enemies, and captured 111 pseudo-reactionary "secret society" members, seizing one light machine gun, fifteen rifles and carbines, five pistols, and 570 rounds of ammunition. On October 19th, two companies of the Zhangnan Brigade repelled over 200 men of the enemy Cheng Daosheng's unit southeast of Watianji, killing or wounding a total of fifteen, with no casualties on our side. On the morning of the 24th, over 500 of the pseudo-Wang Ziquan's troops in Anyang advanced to the area west of Liuyuan to seize grain, but were attacked by our 7th Regiment, which killed, wounded, or captured 41, forcing them to retreat in disarray. On the same day, one company of our × Regiment encountered over 30 enemies in Xixingji, on the south bank of the Anyang River, killing four and suffering no casualties. On the morning of the 25th, the × Regiment was active in Qudian, southeast of Watianji, killing, wounding, and capturing eight enemies. On the 29th, the remnants of the enemy's 40th Division, along with local bandits, totaling 1,000 men, advanced to the Wuqi, Xianxiao, and Yangqi areas on the south bank of the Anyang River to seize grain. Our two battalions rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, and the enemy hastily retreated. We pursued them bravely, killing sixteen and wounding fourteen, capturing two alive. On the night of the 31st, our two companies ambushed the area southwest of Liuyuan at Shuangta. The next morning, the pseudo-Anyang Hanling local township government passed by and was attacked, resulting in eight killed, wounded, or captured, with no casualties on our side. On November 6th, the entire enemy 117th Regiment and one battalion of the 116th Regiment, along with the pseudo-Cixian County Security Regiment and the Home Return Corps, totaling over 3,000 men, advanced towards the Zhanghuding area. Our × Battalion fought bravely, killing or wounding over 80 of them. On the 12th, the × Regiment encountered the enemy's "Expansion Troops" in Nanwuqi, killing or wounding the "Expansion Troop" leader and fourteen others, and capturing the deputy leader and seventeen others alive. On the morning of the 14th, over 200 enemies came to Sheya, east of Watianji, to seize grain. Two platoons of our × Regiment, combined with the militia of Yangqi Village, repelled them, killing or wounding an unspecified number, with no casualties on our side. On the 15th, the pseudo-Wang Huaimi's unit and the "Home Return Corps," totaling over 600 men, launched a five-pronged attack on Qudian and Duzhuang, but were repelled, with 43 killed or wounded, and retreated in disarray. At dawn on the 17th, our × Regiment surrounded and annihilated the reactionary armed forces of the pseudo-"secret society" stationed at Songliangqiao, southeast of Watianji. Except for a dozen or so who escaped, all were wiped out, with ten killed or wounded and 111 captured. We suffered only two casualties.
