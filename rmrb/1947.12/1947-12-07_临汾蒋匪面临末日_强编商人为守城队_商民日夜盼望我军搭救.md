　　【Taiyue Dispatch, 5th】The Chiang bandits besieged in Linfen are increasingly panicked and are forcibly enlisting merchants into "city defense teams." According to merchants who escaped from Linfen, all shops in Linfen have now ceased operations. Starting in November, the Chiang bandits forcibly enlisted merchants between the ages of 18 and 35 into "city defense teams," forming a total of four platoons. They train during the day and guard the city at night. Those who are not qualified are gathered inside and outside the city to dig trenches and build fortifications. Therefore, the shops have had to close. At the same time, they are forcing the people to dig trenches. Guo Baoli, a 69-year-old from Xiaochen Village, was beaten and then shot by the Chiang bandits for being unable to build fortifications. Now the merchants and residents in Linfen are praying day and night for our army to come and rescue them soon.

    【本报太岳五日电】困守临汾的蒋匪，日益恐慌，强编商人为“守城队”。据从临汾城内逃出的商人谈，临汾城内商店，现已全部停止营业。蒋匪从十一月份起，即将十八岁至三十五岁的商人，强编为“守城队”，共编了四个中队。白天训练，黑夜守城。不合格的，即集中在城内外，挖壕修工事。所以商店不得不停业。同时，又驱使百姓挖壕，小陈村一个六十九岁的郭宝礼，因修不动工事，被蒋匪吊打后枪毙。现临汾城内商民日夜盼祷我军快去搭救他们。
