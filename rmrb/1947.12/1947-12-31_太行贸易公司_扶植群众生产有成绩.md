　　Taihang Trading Company
  　Achievements in Supporting Mass Production
    [This Dispatch from Taihang, 29th] Since implementing the policy of primarily supporting mass production, the Taihang Trading Company has made significant contributions to the development of the textile industry and the adjustment of military and civilian food supplies over the past year. (1) Supporting Textiles: During the "Hundred-Day Textile Movement" alone, it prepared 300,000 jin of cotton, transporting it to wherever it was needed for adjustment. At the same time, it absorbed locally produced cloth in an organized manner through cooperatives, reaching over 14 million square feet this year. This supplied military needs, stimulated mass production, prevented cloth prices from falling, and guaranteed mass profits. (2) Adjusting Salt Supply: Salt was transported to various sales locations last winter, preventing price fluctuations during the rainy season. In the first half of this year, another 7 million jin were concentrated, with only 4 million jin sold, ensuring that the masses did not suffer from a shortage. At the same time, during the Yu-Bei and Zhengtai Campaigns, mobile cooperatives were organized to supply the troops and the people in the war zones, maintaining stable prices. (3) Stabilizing Grain Prices: In the first half of the year, 18 million jin were adjusted, mainly through exchanges for salt and local cloth, with Shahe County alone reaching 3 million jin. Grain prices once rose due to famine between April and May of this year, but due to mutual adjustment and stimulation of mass transportation, they quickly stabilized. (4) Organizing the Export of Mountain Products: Goat wool, peppercorns, hemp, iron, bamboo, medicinal materials, etc., accounted for 10% of all trade. Most of the mountain products absorbed have been sold, with only a small amount of sheepskin and rhubarb remaining, which will not be difficult to sell. (5) Balancing Prices: Throughout the year, by implementing the correct policy of primarily supporting mass production, rather than a purely profit-oriented view, the company has systematically adjusted salt, grain, and other materials in various regions, and organized trade in mountain products, bringing prices throughout the region towards balance and normal development, benefiting the broad masses.

  　扶植群众生产有成绩
    【本报太行二十九日电】太行贸易公司，自执行以扶植群众生产为主的方针后，一年来对纺织事业发展与军需民食的调剂贡献颇大。（一）扶植纺织：仅在百日纺运中，即准备了三十万斤棉花，那里缺往那里运，进行调剂，同时并通过合作社有组织的吸收土布，今年达一千四百多万平方尺，这样供给了军需，刺激了群众生产，没有使布价下跌，保证了群众利润。（二）调剂食盐：在去冬即已运至各销售地，使在雨水多的季节，价格未受波动，今年上半年又集中了七百万斤，只售出四百万斤，群众即未受到供不应求的困难。同时在豫北、正太战役时，组织了随军合作社，供给部队与战地群众食用，保持物价平稳。（三）稳定粮价：前半年调剂出一千八百万斤，主要是换盐换土布，仅沙河一县即达三百万斤。今年四五月间，因灾荒粮价曾一度上涨，但由于互相调剂，刺激群众性运输，随即趋于平稳。（四）组织山货出口：羊绒、花椒、麻、铁、竹、药材等占全部贸易百分之十，吸收山货，大部已推销，只留少数羊皮、大黄，亦不难售出。（五）平衡物价：一年中由于执行了以扶植群众生产为主的正确方针，不是单纯营利观点，有计划的调剂了各地盐、粮等物资及组织山货贸易，使全区物价趋于平衡与正常发展，广大群众获得了利益。
