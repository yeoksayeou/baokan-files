    Taihang Allocates Another 300 Million Yuan
    Organize and Employ Poor Peasants for Winter Production
    [This newspaper's Taihang News] To vigorously support winter production by poor peasants, the Taihang Administrative Office has decided to issue an additional 350 million yuan in loans. The allocation is as follows: 100 million yuan for the First District, 60 million yuan for the Second District, 50 million yuan for the Third District, 50 million yuan for the Fourth District, and 90 million yuan for the Fifth District. In addition, the 65 million yuan of low-interest loan revolving funds left in the districts from the previous time will also be allocated, as follows: 20 million yuan for the First District, 30 million yuan for the Second District, 10 million yuan for the Fourth District, and 5 million yuan for the Fifth District. A supplementary instruction once again pointed out: "Due to the fact that the newly emancipated or not yet fully emancipated poor peasants in the land reform, although they have been allocated some land, are still economically weak and have weak reproductive capacity with numerous difficulties; this year's disaster and poor harvest have hit the poor peasants the hardest due to their lack of savings and new household expenses; in addition, our funds are limited, and if we do not consider the target and distribute the loans in a scattered manner, the power will be even smaller, so our loans must be concentrated on the poor peasants, and supporting poor peasants' production must be our firm and unwavering policy." It continued: "Since the poor peasants are not in power in most villages and cooperatives, in order to ensure that the loans are truly given to the poor peasants, each village can organize a poor peasant loan committee and distribute the loans without going through village cadres and cooperatives (if the village has been transformed and the poor peasants have established power, of course, it can also be done through them). The poor peasant committee must be democratically elected by the poor peasants. The distribution must still be discussed and approved by the poor peasants. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent the average use of scattered forces, so that the poor peasants feel that the problem is not solved and that consumption is encouraged. Old loans will be adjusted through a general inspection: loans to landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants that are due and loans to middle peasants that are used improperly will be resolutely recovered; for middle peasant loans that are not due, they can generally be mobilized to voluntarily return the funds from the perspective of class mutual assistance and transfer them to the most difficult poor peasants. When making collective loans, they should be loaned to individual poor peasants in the mutual aid group, and at the same time, poor peasants who have not participated in the mutual aid group should also be able to obtain loans. The interest rate, except for the disaster relief low-interest loans with a monthly interest rate of 8 per mille, shall be calculated at 2% per month for the rest. For those who are loaned through credit cooperatives (departments), it generally shall not exceed one time the original bank interest rate (i.e., 4%), which shall be discussed and decided by the poor peasants.

    太行再拨三万万元
    组织雇贫冬季生产
    【本报太行讯】为了大力支援雇贫冬季生产，太行行署决定继续增发贷款三万万五千万元。计分配：一分区一万万元，二分区六千万元，三分区五千万元，四分区五千万元，五分区九千万元。并将上次留区行之低利贷款机动资金六千五百万元，一并分配，计：一分区二千万元，二分区三千万元，四分区一千万元，五分区五百万元。并补充指示再次指出：“由于土改中新翻身或尚未翻透身的雇贫，虽然分到一部土地，但经济上还底虚腰软，再生产能力薄弱，困难重重；今年灾荒歉收，雇贫由于素无积蓄，及新建家消耗，受灾又最重；加以我们资金有限，如再不问对象，分散贷出，则力量更小，因此，我们的贷款就必须集中使用于雇贫，而以支援雇贫生产为坚定不移方针”。继称：“由于现在大部村庄及合作社，雇贫没当权，为了保证真正贷到雇贫手里，各村可组织雇贫贷款委员会，不经村干部与合作社发放（如已经过改造而树立贫雇掌权者，当然也可以通过其贷款）。雇贫委员会一定要由雇贫民主产生。发放时仍要经雇贫讨论通过。同时应防止平均使用分散力量，以致使雇贫感到不解决问题，助长了消耗。旧贷从普遍检查中进行调整：地主富农及到期的和用途不当的中农贷款，坚决收回；未到期中农贷款，一般的可进行动员，号召从阶级互助出发，将款自动交回，转给最困难的雇贫。集体贷款时，要贷给互助组中的雇贫个人，同时要使没有参加互助组的雇贫，也能贷到款。利息除救灾低利贷款月息八厘外，其余一律以二分计，通过信用社（部）贷放者，一般不超过银行原利率之一倍（即四分），由雇贫讨论决定。                （＠田）
