    Yuci Emphasizes Leadership in Production
    Deputy County Head Personally Handles Transportation
    Taihang Second Administrative Office Issues Commendation
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 16th dispatch] Comrade Wang Honggang, Deputy County Head of Yuci, personally led the masses in transportation, achieving remarkable results and winning a commendation from the Second Administrative Office. The county has suffered from natural disasters and Yan Xishan's misfortune in recent years, resulting in severe famine. Only fifty-seven villages in the county's base area remain, with a total shortage of over 10,000 *shi* of grain. The Second District has a better harvest, but the average per person is only 1.2 *dou* of grain, making it even more difficult for poor peasants, hired laborers, and transferred people in the border areas. To make up for the poor harvest, the county leadership, in addition to organizing the masses to spin and weave, particularly emphasized organizing the masses for transportation. On the 28th of last month, the entire county organized 400 head of livestock and 300 laborers, led personally by Deputy County Head Wang Honggang, Construction Section Chief Li Zhendong, and more than ten district cadres, to conduct transportation in the central areas of Yushe and Wuxiang, with the slogan: "Strive to complete 1,000 *shi* of millet!" Based on the recent days of transporting coal and salt, it is estimated that 805 *shi* of millet can be earned, and the task of 1,000 *shi* of millet is expected to be successfully completed. To this end, the Taihang Second Administrative Office issued a special circular to the entire administrative region, commending Yuci's transportation work. The circular stated that the main reason for the county's achievements in transportation is that the county leadership correctly recognized the severity of the famine and did not adopt a waiting attitude. This spirit of responsibility to the masses should be emulated by responsible comrades at all levels throughout the region. They should overcome waiting and complacency and take immediate action to organize the masses for winter production.

    榆次重视领导生产
    副县长亲自搞运输
    太行二专署通令表扬
    【本报太行十六日电】榆次副县长王鸿岗同志亲率群众运输，成绩卓著，荣获二专署通令表扬。该县年来遭受天灾、阎祸，灾荒严重，全县根据地只有五十七个村，共缺粮食一万余石。二区收成较好，但每人才平均一石二斗，至于贫雇与转出的边地群众就更加困难了。县领导上为了弥补歉收，除组织群众纺织外，特别重视组织群众运输。上月二十八日，全县组织了四百头牲口、三百个人力，由王副县长鸿岗、建设科长李震东及区干部十余人亲自率领，到榆社、武乡等腹心地区进行运输，提出的口号是：“为完成一千石小米而努力！”以最近几天运炭、运盐来看，即可赚米八百零五石，预计一千石米任务当可顺利完成。为此，太行二专署特通令全专区，表扬榆次运输工作，通令中称：该县运输取得成绩的主要原因是，该县领导上正确认识了灾荒的严重，没有等待思想。这种对群众负责的精神，全区各级负责同志，均应向他们学习，克服等待、自满思想，立即行动起来，组织群众冬季生产。
