    Closer Integration with the Broad Masses of Poor and Hired Peasants
    "Xin Dazhong" (New Masses) to be Changed to a Popular Newspaper
    Writer Zhao Shuli Joins the Editorial Staff
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] "Xin Dazhong," the most widely distributed popular publication with the largest readership in our region, has been published up to its 45th issue since its inception in June of the year before last, and is quite popular among the broad masses. In order to clarify its target audience and cooperate with the upcoming Great Review Movement, the publication has decided to change to a newspaper starting next year, targeting the broad masses of poor peasants and district and village cadres and primary school teachers from poor and hired peasant backgrounds. The language will be made even more accessible and easy to understand. The newspaper is tentatively scheduled to be a weekly, published once a week, the same size as the Taihang Xinhua Daily, divided into four pages. Pages one and two will be dedicated to news and information about the land reform review; page three will cover major domestic, international, and Liberated Area events; and page four will be a supplement, including "Masses' Mailbox," "Questions and Answers," short stories, and a "Mini Dictionary," replacing the old "Xin Dazhong." The newspaper is actively being prepared and is scheduled to be published on January 1st of next year. Writer Zhao Shuli is also participating in the newspaper's editorial work. The newspaper has issued a notice welcoming local peasant associations and poor and hired peasant groups to organize reading groups, maintain regular contact with them, contribute articles, and promote the newspaper.
