　　Xingtai Jiangshui Town
  　Responds to Call to Plant More Indigo, Advocates Using Local Indigo to Open Dye Shops
    [Report from our newspaper in Xingtai] The masses in Xingtai County, under the government's call to plant more special products, have planted a large amount of indigo. This year, the county harvested more than 210,000 jin of local indigo. In Jiangshui Town's 700 mu of water ponds, apart from some planted with cotton and peanuts, 400 mu were planted with indigo. Indigo production could reach more than 16,000 jin. In order to promote local indigo and facilitate the masses in purchasing and handing over public grain, the town's cooperative established a sales outlet in Xingtai City and opened a dye shop, temporarily borrowing money to buy millet to first pay the public grain. Up to now, they have sold more than 2,200 jin of local indigo (in about forty days). The principal and interest on the borrowed funds have been paid off. The leadership relies on them to help and transform the old dye shops in Xingtai City. Currently, the city has added five more earth indigo dyeing vats (the city's 18 dye shops all used foreign indigo to boil cloth in the past). Because the citizens of Xingtai are not yet accustomed to local indigo, they have begun to pay attention to publicity work, such as proposing: "Using foreign indigo is a kind of aggression by imperialism against us," "Local indigo dyeing does not fade, and the dyeing price is cheap (boiling blue costs 350 per foot, while earth-dyed double blue only costs 300 yuan)," etc. In addition to the dye shops publicizing dyeing to the masses, a branch company also used the company's name to post colorful advertisements in the streets and alleys. At the dye shop meetings, they held up dyed blue cloth to compare and show everyone, which had a great effect. In addition, Comrade Li Jiazhen of the Jiangshui Town Cooperative personally guided the dye shops in setting up the vats and unreservedly taught others the technique of dyeing cloth. They transported indigo water from Jiangshui Town, 130 li away, to supply the newly added earth dye vat dye shops as base water.
    According to a rough calculation, each person in Xingtai City needs to dye a bolt of cloth (40 to 50 square feet per bolt) every year. If using foreign indigo, each bolt costs 8,000 to 9,000 yuan in dyeing fees. With a population of more than 50,000, we would have to pay 400 million to 500 million yuan. Using more local indigo could greatly reduce these expenses. (Geng Yuan, Xi Zheng)

　　邢台浆水镇
  　响应号召种蓝多倡用土靛开染坊
    【本报邢台讯】邢台县群众，在政府号召多种特产口号下大量种靛，全县今年共收了土靛二十一万余斤。浆水镇的七百亩水池中，除部分种棉花、花生外，种蓝四百亩。产靛可达一万六千斤以上，该镇合作社为了推销土靛，以便于群众购交公粮，在邢市设立了门市，并开了染坊，暂借款买成小米，先交了公粮。截至现在，他们已推销土靛二千二百多斤。（约四十来天）借贷之款，本利已交清。领导上依靠他们帮助并改造邢市旧染坊，现全市增设土靛染缸者，已达五家，（全市十八家染坊，过去都是用洋靛煮布。）因邢市市民对土靛还不习惯，开始注意了宣传工作，如提出：“使用洋靛是帝国主义对我们一种侵略”“土靛染上不退色，染价便宜（煮青每尺三百五，，土染双青才三百元）”等。除染坊对染布的群众多宣传外，一分公司又用公司名义，在各街巷口张贴了花彩广告，在染坊会议上，拿着染出的青布，以实际来比较叫大家看，这都起了很大作用。此外浆水镇合作社李加珍老同志，又亲自指导各染坊按缸，并毫不保守的教给别人染布技术。他们从相离一百三十里浆水镇驮来靛水，供给各新加土染缸染坊做底水。
    据粗略计算，邢市每人每年要染一匹布（每匹四十到五十方尺），以洋靛计每匹用染钱八千到九千元，五万多人口，我们就得支付四万万到五万万元，多用土靛这些支付就可大减。（庚元、晰争）
