　　Specialized Office and County/District Cadres Randomly Enlist Ruffians as "Backbones"
　　Speculative False Reporting and Employing the Poor to Seize Power
　　The True Motive Still Requires Further Investigation
    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Shengduo, the district chief of the first district of She County, Jiang Zhisheng, the construction section chief of the county government, and Deputy Section Chief Wang of the Civil Affairs Section of the Fifth Specialized Office, distorted the facts and falsely reported that hired and poor peasants were in power in Yantou Village. After the autumn harvest this year, the three men went to Yantou Village to mobilize hired and poor peasants to lead production, but they did not mobilize the hired and poor class at all. As soon as they arrived in the village, they found several ruffians they knew, treated them as hired and poor peasants, and relied on them to contact eighteen people, some of whom were old middle peasants and former village cadres, but they were all regarded as hired and poor peasants. They held a meeting, but did not carry out any ideological enlightenment, only asking, "Are we poor people willing to organize?" The answer was, "Yes." In this way, they compiled four hired and poor peasant groups. Li, Jiang, and Wang were satisfied and thought they had truly established hired and poor peasant backbones. When they returned to the county to report, they spoke of hired and poor peasants all the time, sounding as if it were true. They also wrote it into a news report and published it in the Taihang Xinhua Daily and the People's Daily (see the front page of the second edition of this newspaper on October 9th – Editor) to confuse readers. In fact, these "hired and poor peasant backbones" they fostered, such as Zhang Yukun, was a big ruffian, served in the Chiang army, often gambled in the village, had illicit affairs, and was idle. After becoming the leader of the hired and poor peasant group, he took charge of everything in the village, came forward in everything, and took the opportunity to engage in corruption, causing dissatisfaction among the hired and poor peasants and ridicule from those above the middle peasant class. The head of the large group, Zhang Siming, was also a big ruffian. His grandfather was a big landlord. Before the war, he opened a tobacco shop. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he joined our army but later surrendered to the Japanese invaders and worked as a translator. After returning to the village, he swaggered and became the group leader. He deliberately refused to calculate work points, only created trouble, and stirred up Yantou Village like a pool of muddy water. Later, Zhang Yukun's corruption developed further, and the masses could no longer bear it and struggled against him. The truth about "hired and poor peasants in power" was then exposed. According to Xing Chongzhi, the secretary of the district party committee, the main reason for the above-mentioned serious errors was that our cadres did not have a class concept and were acting out of bureaucratism, mobilizing the hired and poor masses only to catch up with the "fashion" and speculate, deceiving the masses and establishing ruffians and bad elements as "hired and poor peasant backbones."
    On the 21st, the Taihang Xinhua Daily specially published a short commentary, discussing this incident, saying: "Due to the blurred class viewpoint of the cadres, they took advantage of the opportunity to regard some ruffians and bad elements as hired and poor peasant backbones, engaging in speculation, harming the masses of the village, and falsely reporting, making false reports, poisoning the work. At the same time, the landlord class took the opportunity to use these elements to destroy the interests of the hired and poor masses through legal means, cunningly and stubbornly." The short commentary also said: "The leadership at all levels should indeed check the actual situation of the hired and poor peasants in power. Those who have truly mobilized the hired and poor peasants should be praised, and speculative behaviors in work and 'empty talk' in reporting (especially to newspapers) should be supervised at any time, and should be ruthlessly exposed so that it does not deceive everyone and endanger the masses."

　　专署和县区干部瞎拉流氓充“骨干”
  　投机谎报雇贫当权
  　究竟是啥动机还应进一步检查
    【本报讯】涉县一区区长等干部歪曲事实，谎报沿头村雇贫当权。今年秋后，涉县第一区区长李声铎、县政府建设科长江志胜、五专署民政科王副科长三人，到沿头村发动雇贫领导生产，可是他们并没有进行对雇贫阶层的发动，一到村，便找了几个他们相识的流氓，当作雇贫，又依靠他们，去联络了十八个人，其中有些是老中农和旧村干，但他们一律认作雇贫。召开了一次会议，也不进行思想上的任何启发，只问一句：“咱穷人愿不愿组织？”回答说：“愿意”。就这样编了四个雇贫小组。李、江、王三人也就心满意足，认为真把雇贫骨干树立起来了。回到县上汇报，开口雇贫，闭口雇贫，说得头头是道，好象真有那么回事。并写成新闻，刊登在太行新华日报及人民日报上，（见十月九日本报二版头条——编者）迷惑读者视听。事实上，被他们扶植起来的这些“雇贫骨干”，如张玉昆，是个大流氓，当过蒋军，在村经常赌博，搞破鞋，游手好闲，自当雇贫组长后，村中一切都管，事事出头，乘势大搞腐化，引起雇贫农民不满，中农以上阶层人人耻笑。大组长张思明，也是个大流氓，他祖父是大地主，战前他开过烟店，抗战后曾参加过我军，后来投降日寇，当过翻译官。回村后耀武扬威，当了组长故意不算工帐，只借端生事，把沿头村搅得象一池混水。以后张玉昆腐化更加发展，群众忍无可忍，向他进行斗争，“雇贫掌权”的真象方才败露。据该区分委书记邢崇智谈称：造成上述严重错误的主要原因是，我们那几个干部没有阶级观念，是官僚主义在作怪，发动雇贫群众，只为了赶“时髦”、投机，来欺骗群众，把流氓坏蛋树立成“雇贫骨干”。
    二十一日，太行新华日报特发表短论，论述这一事件说：“由于干部阶级观点模糊，竟投机取巧把一些流氓坏蛋当作雇贫骨干，进行投机取巧，要害本村群众，并虚加汇报，妄作报导，贻毒工作。同时地主阶级，即乘机利用这些分子，以合法手段，狡猾顽强的破坏雇贫群众利益。短论并说：“各地领导上应确实检查雇贫当权的实情究竟如何？对于真正发动了雇贫的，要加表扬，对于工作上的投机行为与报导上的‘客里空’（特别是对报纸）要随时监督，要无情的揭发，不让它来欺骗大家，危害群众。”
