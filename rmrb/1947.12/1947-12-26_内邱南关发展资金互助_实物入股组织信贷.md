　　Neiqiu Nanguan Develops Mutual Aid Funds
　　In-Kind Shares Organize Credit

　　[This newspaper's Neiqiu dispatch] After the cadres of Dameng Village in the Second District heard about Old Wang Lan's organization of credit cooperatives to solve the funding problems for hired and poor peasants at the district and village heads' joint meeting, they went back and immediately convened a mass meeting. After discussing with the masses, they made the masses aware of the importance of winter production. After having production demands, they put forward labor-capital mutual assistance, and the slogan "Labor mutual assistance to do more work, fund mutual assistance to earn more income." After detailed discussion by the masses, they realized that organizing credit was beneficial to both labor and capital. Out of 147 households in the village, 103 households subscribed and deposited 625,700 yuan that night. Adding the 130,000 yuan of agricultural and sideline loan from the county branch bank in the past, the total capital of 755,700 yuan was used to establish a credit cooperative. After its establishment, according to the masses' active production demands, loans were immediately made, totaling 200,000 yuan to support five sideline mutual aid groups, 110,000 yuan in loans to six households to buy livestock, 10,000 yuan in loans to one shoemaker household, 10,000 yuan in loans to one tofu-selling household, and 95,000 yuan in loans to nine weaving households. In addition, another 112,000 yuan was loaned to five other households. This solved the financial difficulties of most of the masses, and winter production began to boom. In Nanguan, First District, the organization of credit cooperatives first involved a mass discussion on whether credit lending was exploitation, and whether it was the same as the usury of old landlords in the past. During the discussion, Liu Baoquan said, "Today's lending is different from the old landlords' usury. In the past, lending meant bankruptcy, but today everyone pools shares and everyone lends, which leads to prosperity." The woman Liu Lingzi said, "I once borrowed 10,000 yuan from the bank and made more than 30,000 yuan by weaving for a month, after giving the bank only 200 yuan in interest." Liu Heini said, "I think this is not bad. If you have money, you can deposit it to earn interest; if you don't have money, you can borrow it for production. Organizing credit cooperatives is really convenient for the masses." After the discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that it was not exploitation, but labor-capital mutual assistance to engage in production. After the masses cleared their minds, 75 people subscribed 169,900 yuan in cash on the spot, 115 jin of seed cotton, 6 jin of thread, 3 dou of millet, and 50 jin of grain straw. The above cash and goods were converted into a total of 231,950 yuan. In addition, Liu Xikui contributed a cloth weaving machine, saying, "No one in my family weaves cloth, so it's idle anyway." Fan Xifu and 14 others contributed an old willow tree, saying in unison, "This tree has been lying around for a year and hasn't grown at all. If the credit cooperative had been established earlier and the tree had been contributed as a share, who knows how much interest it would have generated."
