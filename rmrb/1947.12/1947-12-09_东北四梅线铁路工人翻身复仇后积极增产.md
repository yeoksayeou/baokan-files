　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 7th: After the Siping-Meihekou railway workers underwent the movement to overthrow oppressors and seek revenge, their work efficiency has generally improved. Employees of the Anxi Coal Mine, one of the three major coal mines in Northeast China, have greatly stimulated their production enthusiasm under the slogan "Digging one more cart of coal is equivalent to killing one more enemy." The average daily coal production per person has now increased by 30% compared to mid-July. Transportation workers in the Meihekou section sifted 60 tons of sand outside the city in their spare time to prepare for winter driving. All workers at the station collected 100,000 jin of scrap copper and iron, worth over 2.5 million yuan, solving the problem of material shortage, and worked day and night to transport 9,500 tons of furnace ash outside the section. The repair team planned to repair one vehicle in seven days, but as a result of day and night processing, it was repaired in five days. Currently, workers in various sections are launching a competition to intensify work and support the front lines. Furthermore, workers and coal miners on the line have generally organized pickets to prevent sabotage by special agents and bad elements, and women also participate in guarding posts. Taixin Mine recently launched a mine-loving movement, actively investigating and digging out traitors and bad roots, uncovering spies Wang Bingren and Leng Fuyuan who were hiding among the workers and engaging in sabotage activities. Xi'an railway workers recently exposed Zhang Yuanxin, the big bully section chief who embezzled over 1.9 million yuan. Meihekou workers are now launching a movement to wipe out black spots and cleanse all the labor traitors among the railway workers.

    【新华社东北七日电】四（平）梅（河口）线铁路工人经过翻身复仇运动后，工作效率普遍提高。东北三大煤矿之一的安西煤矿员工，在“多挖一车煤，等于多杀一个敌人”的口号下，大大激发了生产热忱，现每人每日平均产煤较七月中旬已增加百分之三十。梅河口段运输工友工余时至市外筛砂六十吨，以备冬季行车之用，全站工友并搜集破铜烂铁十万斤，价值二百五十万元以上，解决了材料缺乏的困难，并日以继夜的将九千五百吨炉灰运至段外。修理组计划七天修好一台车，日夜加工的结果，五天即已修好。现各段工友正掀起加紧工作、支援前线的竞赛热潮。又该线工人及煤矿工人为防止特务坏蛋破坏，近普遍组织纠察队，妇女亦参加站岗。泰信矿最近并发起爱矿运动，积极查奸挖坏根，挖出暗藏在工人中进行破坏活动的奸细王秉仁、冷福元二人。西安铁路工友日前公开贪污一百九十余万元的大奸霸段长张元鑫。梅河口工友现正展开擦黑点运动，清洗所有路工中的工贼。
