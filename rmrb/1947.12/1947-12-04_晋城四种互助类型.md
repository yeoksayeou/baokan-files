(Reported from Taiyue on the 2nd of this month) The Jincheng County Labor Heroes, Model Cadres, and others held a conference which concluded on the 6th of this month. The conference summarized that there are four types of mutual aid teams in the county: The first type includes the mutual aid teams of Nanyicheng and Siyi in the Second District, Lisai and Ligou in the Seventh District, Tianshuiling in the Fourth District, and Dongguan in the First District. Their characteristics are: (1) Collective production, using work points, agriculture is a "dead labor, live calculation" system; (2) Labor exchange for war support is work for work, supporting the war effort for one day counts as one day of work, the whole village is fully mobilized; (3) War support work and agricultural work are each accounted for separately, there is no mutual aid in this respect, sideline production is profit sharing based on investment, those who invest more get more. The benefits of this type of mutual aid team are that it solves the difficulties of war support and labor shortage and completes the war support production tasks. Its disadvantages are: (1) Those who are more resourceful tend to get rich more easily, while those who are less resourceful do not. The Nanyicheng mutual aid team is an example of this; (2) It cannot fully utilize surplus labor because these three types of labor exchange are not integrated with each other, so there is nothing to do outside of labor exchange; (3) The cooperative is divorced from farmer production and is purely for profit, so it cannot organize the labor of the entire village, only distributing profits according to investment; (4) Precisely because the three are not combined, sideline production is not easy to specialize, and those engaged in sideline production must also farm and support the war effort. The second type includes mutual aid teams in Beipo in the Sixth District, Xiaozhuang in the Fifth District, Xiaodonggou in the Seventh District, and Lucun in the Second District. The characteristics of this type of mutual aid team are: (1) Agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support are unified, which is a step forward compared to the former; (2) Profit sharing based on labor and capital is implemented, which can stimulate the production enthusiasm of individuals; (3) Both agriculture and sideline occupations are recorded by work done, which can stimulate production; (4) War support uses a unified accounting system for long and short distances and full and half labor, so no one suffers losses. But there are also several shortcomings: (1) Although agriculture and sideline occupations record work done, profits are distributed according to fixed shares (original regulations), so people with strong labor and high skills are unwilling to do more; (2) In the three-way combination of agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support, only transportation is combined, and important rural activities such as weaving are not; (3) Capital receives more profit sharing than labor. Some Xiaozhuang mutual aid teams even distribute profits by household and apportion support rice according to reasonable burden, which is neither reasonable nor fair, and cannot improve labor. The third type includes mutual aid teams in Yuneng in the Third District and Qimu in the Seventh District. The characteristics of this type of mutual aid team are: (1) Agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support are all combined, and all are labor for labor; (2) In addition to war support running transport counting one day as one work unit, all other types of work are recorded according to work done and profits are distributed according to work points; (3) The money earned from various sideline occupations belongs to the entire team and is distributed uniformly by the team according to work points. The benefits of this type of mutual aid team are that, in addition to solving the war support problem, it can leverage each individual's skills in agriculture and sideline occupations. The more and better the work, the more work points are earned. In this way, sideline occupations can be specialized, technology can be continuously improved, and quality can be further improved. However, there are still two points that need improvement: (1) The large cooperative still distributes profits according to investment (such as in Yuneng), and should distribute them to each team. (2) Running transport is also counted as one work unit per day, which sometimes cannot leverage the individual's enthusiasm. Qigan Village does well in this aspect, where the more money earned, the more profit sharing and wages are received. The fourth type is the new method of (land mutual aid) in Yuneng. After the implementation of this mutual aid method, it can solve the problems that cannot be solved in the "three-way mutual aid team," such as doing work earlier or later, lack of livestock and farm tools, and the peace of mind of war support personnel, but it should still be improved.
(Reported from Taiyue on the 2nd of this month) Jincheng Jinjiang Village recently summarized a year of transportation, earning a total of 4,513,000 yuan in silver and buying back 35 head of livestock. Its main methods are: 1. In transportation production, encourage each household to buy livestock. If anyone wants to buy livestock, the entire team will pool all the money earned from livestock transportation to help, and then the household that bought the livestock will return the money after earning it back. 2. During the agricultural season, in order to ensure that agriculture and sideline occupations do not interfere with each other, a small number of people are selected to drive two to three head of livestock each, taking turns to transport. The remaining labor force all participates in agricultural production. 3. When militiamen and civilian workers participating in the war go on expeditions, they can hand over their livestock to the mutual aid team to engage in transportation in rotation, and then share the dividends according to the number of livestock transports. In this way, from the fall of last year to the present, in one year, the money earned, in addition to buying 35 head of livestock, also leaves a balance of 11,172,000 yuan in local currency. In this year's winter production, it is planned to achieve one head of livestock per household.

　　晋城四种互助类型
    【本报太岳二日电】晋城于六日结束的全县劳动英雄模范干部等大会，总结出全县互助组共有四种类型：第一种，有二区南义城、四义，七区李塞、李沟，四区天水岭，一区东关等村互助组。其特点是：（一）集体生产，使工票，农业是死工活计；（二）参战变工是工顶工，参战走一天顶一天，全村满打满算；（三）参战与农业工都是各清各项，没有互助到一块，副业生产是按资分红，谁入的多谁分的多。这类互助组的好处是解决了参战与劳力缺乏的困难，完成了参战生产任务。其缺点是：（一）越有办法的人越容易发财，越没办法的人就不行。如南义城互助组即是如此；（二）不能充分发挥剩余劳力，因为这三种变工还没有互相结合起来，所以除变工外，就没事了；（三）合作社与农民生产脱离，单纯是营利，所以也不能组织起全村的劳力来，只是按资分红；（四）正因为不是三者结合，所以副业也不容易专门化，搞副业人要种地还要参战。第二种有六区北坡、五区小庄、七区小东沟、二区鲁村等村互助组。这类互助组的特点是：（一）农副业参战统一起来了，比前者更进了一步；（二）实行了劳资分红，可以发挥各个人的生产积极性；（三）农副业均是按活记工，可以刺激生产；（四）参战是长短差、全半劳力统一算帐，都不吃亏。但也有几个缺点：（一）农副业虽按活计工，却是按死股（原规定）分红，因此劳动力强、技术高的人就不愿做的更多；（二）农副业参战三结合中只结合了运输，农村重要的纺织等没有结合起来；（三）资本分红较劳力多，有的小庄互助组更是按户分红，按合理负担摊支差米，既不合理公道，也不能提高劳力。第三种有三区庾能、七区七木等村互助组。这类互助组的特点是：（一）农副业参战全部结合起来了，都一样是工顶工；（二）记工法除参战跑运输走一天为一工外，其余各种工都是以活记工，按工分红；（三）各种副业赚回的钱，均属全组，由组统一按工分。这类互助组的好处是，除解决参战问题外，在农副业上能发挥各个人的一技之长，越做得多、做的好，工越顶的多，如此副业可专门化，可使技术不断改进，质量更加提高；但也还有两点需改进：（一）大合作社还是按资分红（如瘐能），应该分归各组。（二）跑运输也是一天算一工，有时不能发挥他个人的积极性，在这方面以七杆村作的好，他是越赚钱多分红和工资也越多。第四种，如庾能的（土地互助）新办法，这互助办法实行后，可以解决“三合互助组”中所不能解决的问题。如先做后做，牲畜、农具缺乏，参战人员的安心等，但也还应该改进。
    【本报太岳二日电】晋城金匠村，于最近总结一年运输，共赚洋四百五十一万三千元，买回牲口三十五头。其主要办法有：一、在运输生产中，鼓励各户都买牲口。谁要买牲口，全组就将牲口运输赚的钱，全部集中起来帮助，以后买牲口户赚回钱来再归还。二、在农业季节中，为使农副业两不误，抽出少数人员，每人赶二头至三头牲口，轮流运输。余下的劳力，全参加农业生产。三、参战的民兵、民工出征时，可把牲口交与互助组，轮流搞运输，以后按畜力运输次数分红利。这样从去年秋后开始运输到现在，一年内，赚下的钱除买牲口三十五头外，还剩本币一千一百一十七万二千元。今年冬季生产中，计划做到每户一头牲口。
