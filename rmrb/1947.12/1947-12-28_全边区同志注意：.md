　　Attention all comrades in the Border Region:
    Today, our newspaper is publishing the Outline Land Law of China. We will continue to publish important documents related to this in the future. As soon as you receive the newspaper, you must immediately read it to the masses, explain it to them, and organize the masses to discuss it thoroughly. Convey the opinions of the masses, and more importantly, the opinions of the hired and poor peasants, to us in their original form. Write down whatever you have, be honest and truthful, and don't be "hypocritical" at all. At the same time, please send us the investigative materials on incomplete land reform from leading organs at all levels as soon as possible!

　　全边区同志注意：
    今天我们报纸公布中国土地法大纲，以后还要连着公布这方面的重要文件，大家一接到报纸要马上念给群众听，解释给群众听，组织群众圪扯讨论。把群众的意见、更重要是雇贫农的意见，原原本本反映给我们，有啥写啥，老老实实，一点也不要“客里空”。同时，请各级领导机关同志赶快把土地改革不彻底的调查材料寄给我们！
