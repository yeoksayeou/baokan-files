　　Taicheng Middle School Holds Production Summary
  　Exhibition of Achievements Praises Models
    [Reported from Da Ming by our Newspaper] Since the autumn, Taicheng Middle School, with over 200 teachers and students, has been engaged in large-scale production, achieving great results in both agriculture and sideline occupations. From July to November, within five months, they harvested a total of 34,310 catties of vegetables, 305 catties of mung beans, and 469 catties of millet. Private production included: 723 catties of vegetables, 3011.5 catties of firewood, earning 23,243 yuan from spinning yarn, and 13,600 yuan from collecting manure. 3.75 mu of wasteland were reclaimed. This solved the school's vegetable expenses for half a year, and from December, the meals of some poor students can also be fully provided. On the morning of November 30th, the school held an autumn production summary and model commendation meeting. Zhu Linsheng and 15 others received prizes and were respected by the entire school. In the afternoon, an achievement exhibition was held, with various products gathered in one room, attracting a continuous stream of visitors. (Wei Guang)
