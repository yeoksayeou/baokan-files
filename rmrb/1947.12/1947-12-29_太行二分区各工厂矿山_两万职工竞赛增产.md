　　Taihang Second District Factories and Mines
  　20,000 Employees in Production Increase Competition
    [This newspaper reports] Over 20,000 employees in the Taihang Second District, in order to greet the New Year and present a gift to the counter-offensive army, have successively launched production increase competition movements in various places. First, the entire district unanimously put forward a resounding action slogan, which is to achieve five goods (sufficient raw materials, large quantity, good quality, low cost, wide sales) to obtain three benefits (work hard by ourselves, work can be added to work; everyone has good results, labor and management have profits; production is increased day and night, which is beneficial to the great counter-offensive). Changfusheng of the Ciyoutou in Xiangyuan Fifth District said at the Full Federation Branch Congress on the 28th of last month: I am a newly liberated worker, and only increasing production can actually help the front line. There are 112 miners, eight large and small kilns, including two machine kilns, one turnstile, and four livestock in the whole district, which can produce a total of 49,500 baskets of coal. After the meeting, each mine formulated a production plan for the entire district. Except for Nanli and other places that have not been ordered, the other five coal mines guarantee to increase coal production by 117 baskets per day. Before the lunar New Year, 4,400 baskets will be increased, which is equivalent to more than 1.19 million yuan in foreign currency, and mutual inspection methods have been formulated. Under the slogan of "finding and mending nails and patching holes, using sideline production to make up for poor harvests; not eating autumn grain this winter, and leaving surplus grain for the spring famine," Heshun County's farmers and miners have jointly launched a winter production campaign. Farmers are carrying out large-scale transportation to ensure that 60,000 jin of large charcoal are exported every day; miners are also starting together, each formulating a production increase plan, guaranteeing the production and supply of 76,400 jin of charcoal needed by the masses in the county every day. When necessary, they will work in two shifts, day and night, to process and produce, guaranteeing another 60,000 jin of large charcoal. A bonus distribution method has been formulated, and equal value exchange between workers and peasants (workers and peasants have production standards). Beyond the standard, the extra is divided 20/80 (80 for those who exceed the standard). The movement has now begun. According to preliminary estimates, each miner can earn eight more stones of coarse grain than before the worker-peasant mutual assistance. In order to produce more nitrate for military use, the county's nitrate workshops have developed from 14 to 38. The ones newly established this winter have also started construction, and a method of using black alkali to replace grass ash has been created, which is simple to use and highly effective. The Fengmin Textile Factory of the Yushe County United Cooperative has increased the daily output of blankets from four to six, and socks from four dozen to seven and a half dozen. After Comrades Li Chunshou and Ma Yunshan painstakingly researched and successfully developed a pressing machine, they then created a hand-pulled shuttle with two machines connected, one machine can produce the output of two machines, and it also saves one manpower compared to before. Therefore, the product has exceeded 65 percent, and the coarse cloth is smooth and tidy after being pressed by the pressing machine, improving the quality and beginning to achieve wide sales. Twenty apprentices have also been trained and 19 foreign machines have been promoted. According to incomplete statistics, 21,418 workers in large and small factories, mines, and workshops in the entire district have been organized and have joined the movement. The movement is now at its climax.　　　　　　　　　(Bing Ying)

　　太行二分区各工厂矿山
  　两万职工竞赛增产
    【本报讯】太行二分区两万余职工，为迎接新年给反攻军献礼，各地均先后掀起了增产竞赛运动。首先全区一致的提出了响亮的行动口号，是要做到五好（原料足、数量多、质量好、成本低、销路广）取得三利（自己努力干，功上能加功；大家成绩好，劳资有利润；日夜都增产，利于大反攻）。襄垣五区磁窑头于上月二十八日召开全联支大会，常福生说：我是新翻身的工人，只有增产才能实际帮助前线。全区有矿工一百一十二人，大小窑八个，内有两个机器窑，一个转车，用牲口四头，共可产煤四万九千五百筐。会后各矿又订出全区生产计划，除南里等地未订外，其它五个煤矿每天保证增产煤一百一十七筐，旧历年前要增产四千四百筐，可合洋一百一十九万余元，并订出相互检查等办法。和顺在“找补钉补窟窿，副业生产补歉收；今冬不吃今秋粮，余下粮食渡春荒”的口号下，全县农民与矿工合伙掀起冬产大运动，农民开展大运输，保证每日输出大炭六万斤；矿工也一齐动手，各自订出增产计划，每日保证生产供给本县群众需要炭七万六千四百斤外，必要时分明夜两班，加工生产，保证再增产，运输大炭六万斤。并订出了分红奖励办法，工农等价交换（工农都有生产标准），超过标准以外，二八分红（超过标准者为八），现运动已开始。据初步估计，每个矿工较工农未互助以前，能多赚粗粮八石。该县硝坊为更多的出产土硝供给军火使用，已由十四个硝坊发展到卅八个了，今冬初建立的也动工了，并创造了利用黑碱，代替草灰的办法，用法简单而效力大。榆社县联社丰民纺织工厂，毛毯由日产四条增至六条，袜子由四打增至七打半；李春首、马云山二同志苦心研究压布机成功以后，接着又创造了手拉梭连二机，一架能顶两架出产，还比前省了一个人力，因此产品已超过百分之六十五，并且粗布一经压布机压后，光滑整齐，提高了质量，开始达到销路广。又培养了二十个学徒，推广了十九架洋机。据不完全统计，全区大小工厂、矿山、作坊，组织起来的两万一千四百一十八名工人，都已卷入运动，现在运动正在高潮中。　　　　　　　　　（秉英）
