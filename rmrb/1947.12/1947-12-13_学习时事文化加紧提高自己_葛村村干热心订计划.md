Study Current Events and Culture, Intensify Self-Improvement: Ge Village Cadres Enthusiastically Make Plans

[This newspaper Shahe News] In Ge Village, Sixth District, at the cadre meeting on the twelfth of last month, when discussing the shortcomings of the leadership, it was found that not enough attention was paid to propaganda work, and the masses did not know about the victories on the front lines. Take this year as an example: on August 15th, a village-wide meeting was held to celebrate the great victory on the front lines, and the masses increased the wheat planting area by 100 mu. Without that propaganda, how could there have been such great power? From the current point of view, when a grain transportation task came, we also promoted the liberation of Shijiazhuang, so that the masses recognized the great victory on the front lines, and we should support the front lines from the rear. Everyone was very enthusiastic about transporting grain and even suggested: "Now that Shijiazhuang has been liberated, next time Beijing will be liberated too." Some said: "I want to visit Beijing." Others said: "If you want to go to Beijing, you have to step up support for the front lines." From several practical experiences, it was studied that propaganda work should be valued in the future. Everyone also said, "We are illiterate and cannot read newspapers, how can we publicize to the masses?" Zhang Jusheng, the director of the farmers' association, said: "From now on, I will go to the school every day to ask the teacher to read the newspaper to me, and when I go to the group meeting at night, I will publicize to the masses. Any victories, experiences, or methods will be known to everyone." Zhang Chang said: "Because I couldn't afford to go to school in the past, I am illiterate, and I have suffered a lot of difficulties in my work." Everyone said, "We all suffer from the same disease." Then it was proposed that everyone should go to school to learn one character every day, and be able to learn seventy or eighty characters before the New Year. The militia captain said: "If you want to study, you have to go to school every day, you can't say go for two days and then not go. Everyone has to make their own study plan." The director of the farmers' association said: "I will guarantee to learn one character every day." The director of the martial arts association said: "I went to school for two days when I was a child, and I will learn three characters a day." Finally, a learning method was discussed, with three people in a group to help each other learn. The slogan proposed was: "No need for lamps when studying at night, sulfur matches are bright and clear, if you don't want difficulties in the future, step up learning and don't relax."

    学习时事文化加紧提高自己
    葛村村干热心订计划
    【本报沙河讯】六区葛村，上月十二日在干部会上研究领导有啥缺点时，检讨出对宣传工作注意不够，群众不知道前线的胜利。就以今年来说，八月十五日开了个全村大会，庆祝前线大胜利，群众种麦时即多增加一百亩。要不是那个宣传，怎样能有这大力量？从当前来说，来了个运粮任务，咱们又把解放石门宣传了一下，使群众都认清前线这样大的胜利，咱们后方应支援前线，大家运粮劲很大，还提出：这次解放了石门，下次北京也要解放了。有的说：我还想到北京串串。有的说：要想到北京还得加紧支援前线。从几次实际经验中，研究出今后应重视宣传工作。大家又说：“咱不识字，不能看报，怎样给群众宣传。”农会主任张聚生说：“咱今后每天到学校叫先生给念报，咱晚上到组开会时，给群众宣传、有什么胜利或经验、办法，都叫大家知道。”张长的说：“因为咱从前上不起学，不识字，对工作上可受的难不少了。”大家都说：“咱们都害的一样病。”接着提出今后大家要每天到学识一个字，年前还能学七八十个字。民兵队长说：“要学习，每天得到学，不能说去两天不去啦。各人还得定出自己的学习计划。”农会主任说：“我每天要保证学一个字。”武会主任说：“我小时上过两天学，我一天学三个字。”最后又讨论出学习办法，三个人一小组，互助学习。提出口号是：“夜里学习不用灯，硫黄火柴明又明，要想今后不困难，加紧学习不放松。”（先孝、景明）
