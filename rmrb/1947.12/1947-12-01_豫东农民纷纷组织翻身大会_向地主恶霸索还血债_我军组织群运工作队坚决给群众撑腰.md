Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 29th: Under the blows of our army against the Chiang bandits and the opening of granaries to relieve the poor, the broad masses of peasants along the Longhai Railway line have organized "Poor People's Overthrow Meetings," "Poor People's Groups," and "Bitter People's Associations" to struggle against landlords and local bullies, demanding repayment of the blood debts owed to the poor. Amidst the booming of cannons, the masses near Yucheng rose up and confiscated the grain of the family of a regimental commander of the puppet Henan Provincial Security Regiment, a local tyrant they deeply hated. In the villages of Da Xiaosunlou, only three miles from the Zhuji front, military-civilian get-together meetings were successively held, where the masses accused the Chiang bandit district and township chiefs and Bao chiefs of conscripting soldiers and levying grain. Hundreds of people angrily destroyed the gold-lettered plaque with the words "Defending All Directions" on the gate of the Sun family, a local bully landlord in the village, and drove out the father-in-law of the Chiang bandit district chief, who had sneaked in to get grain. More than a thousand people in Jiazhai Village, over twenty miles from Yucheng, demanded the confiscation of the property of the big landlord Sun Sijing and the family of Li Xizhi, division commander of the Chiang bandit army Cao Fulin's department. The People's Liberation Army immediately investigated their evil deeds together with the masses and resolutely supported the demands of the masses, opening granaries and distributing grain. The masses thronged to the scene, causing traffic jams. The big landlord Li Kaiguang in Xiaozhuang blocked all four doors of his house, causing great resentment among the masses, who broke down the doors and entered. Young and middle-aged peasants transported the grain, while women and children took the needed thread, cloth, cotton, fur, and clothing of various colors, distributing it from 1:00 p.m. until dusk. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army also organized mass work teams to go to nearby combat villages to support the masses. In Wangzhuangzhai, north of Minquan city, the masses first overthrew a big landlord who had occupied two thousand mu of land, and then divided the ill-gotten wealth of three other bully landlords. The liberated farmers from the liberated areas who participated in the large-scale destruction battle of the Longhai Railway also actively assisted the masses in the new areas on both sides of the railway to carry out liquidation struggles. More than a thousand road-breaking team members in the second district of Chengwu County convened poor people's meetings village by village near Xiaoyangji and Liudi Circle Railway Stations. At the Xinglongji Poor People's Meeting, the liberated farmer Ji You Shun reported his experience of liberation, and the masses immediately divided up fifty large bags of grain, as well as farming cattle and clothing, etc., belonging to two bully landlords in the village. The liberated farmer Liu Qifeng from Chengwu also led the poor people of Taizhuang to divide the grain and ill-gotten wealth of the Zhang family bully, who had occupied more than two thousand mu of land. For a time, peasants in various villages rose up like a storm and joined the struggle. Women in Hanzhuang and other places at Xiaoyangji Railway Station, led by a certain Wang surnamed peasant woman, struggled against the landlords. Young peasants who had been coerced and deceived by the Chiang bandits to leave their hometowns rushed back to participate upon hearing the news. After the peasants of Chengdazhuang divided up the property, they immediately handed over the puppet Bao chief who was hiding in the village to the road-breaking team for disposal. The peasants of various villages also unearthed the guns hidden by the bullies.

Also: When the People's Liberation Army swept away the Chiang bandits in eastern Henan, the poor people of Shangcai reported the Chiang bandit granaries to the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army immediately opened the granaries to relieve the poor, and the masses within fifty li flocked to divide the grain, distributing all 300,000 jin of grain stored in twelve locations. On the spot, more than forty peasants spontaneously formed a "Bitter People's Association" to lead the masses in a struggle against three bully landlords. After a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived at Jugang, it immediately conducted visits to hear grievances, formed five poor people's groups, and held a meeting of more than four hundred people, distributing the landlords' grain and ill-gotten wealth. In Fengzhuang, on the outskirts of Weishi City, more than two hundred households detained the puppet town chief Cai Tongde and others, confiscating all the property he had exploited and returning it to its original owners.
