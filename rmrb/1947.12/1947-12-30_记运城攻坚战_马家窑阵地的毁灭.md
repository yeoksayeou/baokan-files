　　Record of the Yuncheng Campaign
  　The Destruction of the Majiayao Position
    An Xun
    Majiayao was located on a high ground in the southwest corner of Yuncheng, with towering blockhouses. A barbed wire fence surrounded it, about fifty or sixty meters from the first outer trench. The inner trench was more than two meters wide and deep, with two layers of flat barbed wire at the bottom, and landmines and tripwires everywhere. More than twenty steel-reinforced concrete group bunkers were built above the inner trench, connected to each other by underground communication trenches. The firepower of each bunker could shoot in any direction and support each other. However, under the cover of our powerful firepower and the heroic attacks of our soldiers, the so-called "modern permanent fortifications" became the enemy's burial ground. On the 11th, at 4:00 p.m., the "Honghu" First Battalion, which was tasked with the attack, entered the position. Our various artillery fires covering the advance, immediately and accurately bombarded the enemy, preventing them from raising their heads. Under the thick smoke, the First Company rushed out of the position, and the three or four-foot-high barbed wire could not stop them. They occupied the outer trench position in one go, and quickly crossed the inner trench to advance. At this time, the ladder team had not yet arrived, so the heroic warriors jumped into the inner trench together. The inner trench was more than two meters deep, and some were knocked unconscious. They only heard a loud bang in their heads, and then water flowed down. They touched it with their hands and realized it was blood. They knew they had triggered a landmine, but they ignored it, bent down, and quickly cut off the tripwires and landmines. The people behind rushed over, and the First Company occupied the inner trench position. The enemy in the nearby group bunkers were stubbornly resisting with crossfire. The Second and Third Companies bravely advanced to support, and the First Company actively built fortifications and deployed firepower. Before long, all artillery shooters and engineer demolitionists concentrated unprecedentedly fierce firepower to carry out destructive attacks on the enemy's group bunkers. The fire illuminated the position, and with a loud noise that shook dozens of miles, the steel-reinforced concrete group bunkers ended their fate one by one with large holes. At this time, the enemy in the high blockhouse, trapped in a dead end, made a final struggle with intensive artillery fire, but we used fierce firepower to cover the engineers' rapid advance and buried four boxes of explosives next to the high blockhouse. With a loud bang, the high blockhouse that the enemy had managed for several years was blown to the ground. One platoon of the First Battalion of the enemy's 250th Regiment, except for three who were captured, was completely buried underground. Majiayao was one of the four major outer positions of Yuncheng. The destruction of this position opened up a major obstacle to climbing the city.

　　记运城攻坚战
  　马家窑阵地的毁灭
    安迅
    马家窑位于运城西南角的高地，高碉耸立，一道铁丝网，围绕在距第一道外壕五六十米的周围，内壕宽深各二丈余，壕底有两层平铺的铁丝网，并遍布着拉雷和踏雷，内壕上面建筑了钢骨水泥的集团伏地碉共有二十余个，从地下交通沟彼此联络，每个伏地碉的火力，可以射击任何方向，并能互相支援。但在我强大火力掩护及战士英勇攻击下，所谓“现代化的永久性工事”，变成了敌人的葬身基地。十一日，下午四点钟，担任攻击任务的“洪湖”一营进入阵地，我掩护前进的各种炮火，随即一齐向敌人猛烈准确的轰击，打的敌人抬不起头来，在浓厚的烟尘下，一连从阵地上一涌而出，三四尺高的铁丝网也挡不住，一股劲占领了外壕阵地，并迅速越过内壕前进，这时架梯组尚未赶到，于是英勇的健儿一齐跳下内壕。内壕有两丈多深，有的被摔昏迷了，只觉得头上轰的响了一声，就有水流下来，用手一摸，原来是血，才知道是触响了地雷，但他不管这些，弯着腰，迅速剪断拉雷与踏雷，后边的人飞奔过来，一连占领了内壕阵地。附近集团伏地碉的敌人，正以交叉火力进行顽抗。二连、三连勇猛前进支援，一连积极做工事，配备火力。不一会，所有炮兵射击手、工兵爆炸手集中了空前猛烈的火力，向敌集团伏地碉进行摧毁性的攻击。火光照红了阵地，在震动数十里的巨响之下，钢骨水泥的集团伏地碉，一个个开大洞结束其命运。这时，陷于死地的高碉敌人，虽然以密集的炮火进行最后挣扎，但是我以猛烈火力，掩护工兵神速前进，把四箱炸药，埋在高碉旁边，一声巨响，把敌人经管数年的高碉炸成平地，守敌二五○团一营一个排，除三人被俘，其余完全埋在地下。马家窑是运城外围四大阵地之一，这个阵地的摧毁，打开了登城的一个大障碍。
