Fifth Jinnan Prefectural Committee Convenes Cadres from Various Counties
　　Discussing Organization of Winter Production
[This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 25th] In order to extensively develop winter sideline production and practice strict economy, the Fifth Prefectural Committee recently convened a meeting of county committees, branch industrial and commercial bureaus, and bank managers to discuss the issue of leading the masses in winter production. The meeting lasted two days, discussing and deciding on the following issues: (1) During the discussions, everyone became aware of the severity of the drought. For example, Wu’yi County only had an average of 40% of a normal harvest. After paying public grain, the masses had an average of only 160 jin of grain per person, meaning that the entire county of 180,000 people was short of two months' worth of food. Therefore, the principle and purpose of production is to solve the food problem of poor farmers. According to local customs, except for prohibited items and those that encourage waste, such as paper horses, incense, offerings, meat meals, and wine shops, all businesses are allowed to operate freely and are given support. We will not use subjective ideas to restrict the masses, but will boldly mobilize the masses for production. In handicrafts, we will call for technological improvements to ensure sales; (2) In production, we must follow the mass line (especially the poor peasant line). To implement the mass line, we must first change the thinking and work style of cadres, so that cadres examine the extent to which they serve the people (from the perspective of results), correct undemocratic behavior and some mistakes that lose the class stand, and truly serve the basic masses. We must help the masses solve their concerns about production. Regarding the deviations in past sideline production levies, we must admit our mistakes and inspire the masses' enthusiasm for production by calculating accounts on a household basis, and expose reliance on waiting for relief. We call on the masses to focus on small things, not to despise small profits, and not to miss out on big profits. We call on the combination of labor and technology, and encourage mutual assistance as much as possible under the principle of voluntarism. In order to follow the poor peasant line and not be completely restricted by the old activists, when the district assigns work, each village can convene two or three village cadres with a good class stand and several poor masses (the number of poor masses should exceed the number of village cadres) to participate in the meeting. They and the village cadres will jointly establish a production committee to lead production and control loan inspections; (3) Loans must be guaranteed to reach the hands of poor peasants. Whether past loans were correct and whether they should be transferred will also be checked and decided by the poor masses. Village cadres, activists, militia, and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers generally will not be given loans. The loans must be controlled by poor farmers, and the production committee elected by the poor peasant class will be responsible for management. When deciding who to lend to, it should be discussed and decided by the poor peasant congress through comparing conditions and comparing poverty. In order to meet the needs of farmers, in villages that need long-term support, loans will not leave the village and will be lent out as they are collected; (4) The leadership will give strong support. The industrial and commercial administration bureau will issue certificates to the peddlers mobilized this time, with proof from the district, and will not charge fees for business licenses. The assessment of income tax should be differentiated according to family composition and living conditions, giving consideration to the poor. When assessing, there should also be key personnel who hire the poor to participate. All exchanges are notified to provide all possible assistance. Transform the exchanges to make them serve the poor farmers more.

　　冀南五地委召集各县干部
  　商量组织冬季生产
    【本报冀南二十五日电】五地委为了大量开展冬季副业生产，厉行节约，日前特召开各县委、分区工商局、银行经理会议，讨论领导群众冬季生产问题。会议历时两天，讨论与决定了以下几个问题：（一）大家在讨论中警惕到旱灾的严重，如武邑全县平均不过四成年景，群众除缴公粮外，每人平均剩一百六十斤粮食，总计全县十八万群众缺两个月的粮食。因此，生产的原则和目的是要解决贫苦农民的粮食问题。根据当地群众习惯，除违禁品和助长浪费的纸马香课、荤饭、酒铺外，一律自由经营，并给以支持，不拿主观一套去限制群众，放手发动群众生产。在手工业上，号召改良技术，以畅销路；（二）生产中要走群众路线（特别是贫农路线），为了贯彻群众路线，首先要转变干部的思想和作风，使干部检查自己为人民服务的程度（从结果上看），纠正不民主和一些失掉阶级立场的错误行为，真正为基本群众服务。群众在生产上存在的顾虑，要帮助群众解决。对于过去副业征收中的偏差，我们要承认错误，从按家算帐中启发群众的生产积极性，揭发等待救济等依靠思想。号召群众从小处着眼，不要小利看不起，大利赚不到，号召劳力和技术结合，在自愿的原则下尽量互助。为了走贫苦群众路线，不完全受旧的积极分子的限制，区里布置工作时，每村可召集二、三个阶级立场好的村干和几个贫苦群众（贫苦群众要超过村干），参加会议。即由他们和村干共同建立生产委员会，领导生产和掌握检查贷款；（三）贷款要保证贷到贫农手里。过去贷款是否正确，该不该转动，也由贫苦群众来检查决定。村干、积极份子、民兵、抗烈军工属一般不贷给。货款一定要由贫苦农民掌握，由贫农阶层选出生产委员会负责管理。决定贷给谁时，经贫苦农民大会，在比条件、比穷苦中讨论决定。为了适应农民要求，在需要长期支持的村庄，实行款不离村，随收随贷；（四）领导上大力支持，工商管理局对这次发动起来的小摊贩由区证明，工商局发给证件，不收营业证的工料费，对所得税的评议，应联系家庭成份和生活情形有所差别，给贫苦的以照顾。在评议时，也要有雇贫骨干的参加。通知各交易所，给以各种可能的帮助。改造交易所，使他更多的为贫苦农民服务。
