    【Benbao Ji Lu Yu Sixteenth Electric】After the new soldiers of Nanle left, all villages warmly provided preferential treatment to military families and formulated work assistance measures. The masses in Dongjie, the urban area, resolutely guaranteed that the grain harvested from military families' land would be the same as that harvested from their own land. The masses in Qiankou Village, Second District, volunteered to take care of military families. Regarding the preferential treatment measures, most villages established preferential treatment committees to determine the amount of labor assistance required based on the amount of labor available to the military families. For example, the regulations in Liyue Village, Fifth District, are: (1) After a single man enlists, the land will be cultivated by the mutual aid team, and the grain harvested will be given to him according to the average standard of the harvest of his land's neighbors. The firewood, after deducting public firewood, will be used for the mutual aid team's expenses; (2) For military families with people but no labor, all matters will be resolved by the mutual aid team. If the grain harvested from the land is less than that of the neighbors, it will be supplemented to the average standard; (3) For military families with only half a labor force, in addition to their own work, other work will be the responsibility of the mutual aid team; (4) For military families with two and a half labor forces, they should try their best to do their own work, and the mutual aid team will be responsible for what they cannot do; (5) For military families with one full labor force, they will be taken care of on a 40/60 basis, that is, the mutual aid team will take care of 60%, regardless of odd jobs. When dividing the work, all the land in the village that should be cultivated on behalf of others and all the full and half labor forces in the village are counted up, and the cultivation is divided equally. Furthermore, signs are placed on the land of military families cultivated on behalf of others, with the names of the cultivation team and the team leader written on them, to promote competition between the teams. In addition, honorary plaques are hung for military families. In Wangchong Village, Fourth District, in addition to separating the land of military families and assigning specific personnel to take care of it, water for daily use is also marked with plaques, with the names of the military families written on the plaques, and water is carried in turns every day.

    南乐制订优军办法
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】南乐新战士走后，各村热烈优军，纷纷制定帮工办法。城区东街群众，坚决保证军属土地打的粮食和自家土地收的粮食一样多。二区千口村群众，纷纷自报照顾军属。在优军的办法上，大多数村庄成立优军委员会，根据军属劳力的多寡，规定帮助劳力多少。如五区李岳村的规定是：（一）单身汉参军走后，土地由互助组代耕，收的粮食按其土地四邻收获量之中等标准给他，柴草除缴公柴外归互助组费用；（二）有人无劳力的军属，一切事情均由互助组解决，如土地收的粮食不及四邻收的多，亦按中等标准再补充；（三）只有半个劳力的军属，除自己干的外，其他活由互助组负责；（四）有两个半劳力的军属，自己的活尽量干，干不了的由互助组负责；（五）有一个整劳力的军属则四六照顾，即互助组照顾十分之六，不管杂活。分工时把全村应代耕的土地和村中所有整劳力及半劳力都统计起来，均分代耕，并且把代耕军属的土地插上牌，写上代耕组及组长的名字，发动组与组的竞赛。此外还给军属挂光荣匾。四区王崇町村除把军属土地分开规定专人照顾外，日常用水也刻牌子，在牌子上写明军属的姓名，每天轮流挑水。
