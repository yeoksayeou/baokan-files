　　Investigation of Textile Production in Jiao Village Reveals Problems
    Poor and Hired Peasants Have Not Thoroughly Overturned Their Situation – Able to Ensure Food but Not Clothing
    [Our Newspaper] After Jiao Village, in the Second District of Changzhi, proposed winter production, it remained stagnant. After in-depth investigation, many problems were discovered in the textile movement alone. First, the poor and hired peasants' reversal of fortune had no foundation, and they were able to ensure food but not clothing. Out of the village's eleven textile groups, seven groups only wove 1,414 feet of cloth. Statistics from sixteen households show that they had only woven 53.1 zhang of cloth since spring, which was not enough to wear. They bought 39.3 zhang of cloth, but some poor and hired households still do not have cotton clothes. For example, in Wang Xi's wife's group of eleven households, five households are waiting for clothes. Liu Manqiu said: "My whole family is waiting for clothes. We newly emancipated households have no foundation." This winter, the sixteen households still need 47 zhang of cloth. If they use grain to buy cloth, it would take more than 14 shi, creating a great difficulty where they can ensure clothing but not food, or food but not clothing. At the same time, the interests of the poor and hired peasants were not taken care of in the textile groups. In the first half of the year, when making looms, the cooperative provided the carpenters' wages equally to the poor and rich, with the result that ten households of targets of struggle also held loom shares, just like the masses. The poor and hired peasants in the groups could not hold power. Out of eleven group leaders, four were poor and hired women, five were middle peasants, and two were rich peasants. In some cases, although the group leader was a poor or hired peasant, they were actually controlled by the targets of struggle. For example, Liu Qi was just a target of struggle, but she controlled the whole group. The poor and hired masses paid for a teacher, but the target of struggle learned to weave, while the poor and hired peasants could not learn. The targets of struggle, after learning, would not teach others, nor would they let others weave. To this day, Jiao Village does not have a single fully skilled person. When weaving, if the machine breaks down, they don't know how to repair it. In addition, unfairness in labor exchange in the textile groups also hindered the development of the movement. For example, weaving one foot of cloth was the same as spinning one tael of cotton, but the cotton spinners felt they were at a disadvantage and lacked enthusiasm. Some spun thread and sold it in the city, then spun cotton again, earning money to buy cloth. Others did not spin cotton, but bought thread in the city to weave cloth. Everyone said: "There are not many looms, and most of them are idle. We don't have enough clothes to wear. In the future, we will try our best to spin thread and not let the machines stop, strive to become fully skilled, and take in more apprentices." Now, based on the results of the investigation, they are correcting past mistakes, formulating plans, and conducting regular inspections to strive for self-weaving and self-clothing, and wear new clothes for the New Year.

　　焦家庄调查纺织发现问题
    贫雇翻身不彻底顾了吃顾不了穿
    【本报讯】长治二区焦家庄提出冬季生产后，一直轰不开，经过深入调查，仅只纺织运动中就发现许多问题。首先是贫雇翻身没根底，顾了吃顾不了穿。全村共十一个纺织小组，其中七个组才织了一千四百一十四尺布，其中有十六户统计从春天到现在才织了五十三丈一尺布，不够穿，买了三十九丈三尺布，现在仍有贫雇户没穿上棉衣。如王喜媳妇小组十一户就有五户等着穿。刘满秋说：“我全家现在就是等穿，咱新翻身户没个根底。”今冬十六户还须用布四十七丈，如果用米买布，就得十四石多才够，形成顾了穿顾不了吃，顾了吃顾不了穿的大困难。同时在纺织小组中也没有照顾到贫雇利益，前半年做织布机，合作社不分贫富一样给垫木匠工资，结果十户斗争对象也和群众一样顶的织布机股。小组中贫雇又不能掌权，十一个小组长中贫雇妇女四个，中农五个，富农二个。其中有的虽由贫雇当小组长，实际仍被斗争对象把持，如刘七只是斗争对象，她一人把持全组，贫雇群众出米请老师，结果斗争对象学会织布，贫雇反而不能学。斗争对象学会了也不教别人，又不让别人织，至今焦家庄没有一个全把式，正织布，机坏了，也不会修理。另外纺织组在变工方面的不公道，也阻碍了运动的发展。如织一尺布纺一两花一样，而纺花人就嫌吃亏，劲头不大，有的纺上线进城卖了再纺花，赚上钱买布，有的不纺花，进城买线织布。都说：“织布机不多，大都歇着，又没布穿，今后能尽量纺线不让机停，争取个全把式，多收几个徒弟就行了。”现正根据调查结果纠正过去错误，订出计划定期检查，争取自织自穿，过年穿新衣服。
