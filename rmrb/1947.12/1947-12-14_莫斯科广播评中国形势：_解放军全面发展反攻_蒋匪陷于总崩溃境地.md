Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: Moscow's Mandarin broadcast on the 6th commented on the Chinese situation, stating: On all fronts in China, the situation is favorable to the People's Liberation Army. After the People's Liberation Army of North China occupied Shijiazhuang, it continued to develop its offensive on the northern battlefield. The PLA has also stepped up its offensive in Central China. At the Kuomintang State Council meeting, Chiang Kai-shek himself admitted that the activities of the Central China People's Liberation Army had greatly intensified. He claimed that half of Henan Province (note: in reality, except for a few isolated strongholds, all of Henan is under the control of the People's Liberation Army), one-third of Hubei and Anhui, and most of Jiangsu are under the control of the People's Liberation Army. The Kuomintang's financial and economic crisis has reached a fever pitch. Marshall admitted to his Foreign Affairs Committee that the Kuomintang's military expenditure accounts for 80 percent of all its expenditures. The devaluation of "legal tender" in various parts of the Kuomintang-controlled areas has reached an unprecedented level, requiring 158,000 yuan to exchange for one US dollar (note: it reached 160,000 on the 10th of this month). Prices in the Kuomintang areas continue to soar. The Shen Bao reported on November 18th that the situation in the Sichuan market was extremely chaotic, and several factories in Chengdu had closed down again. Conversely, the situation in the liberated areas is obviously different. According to Xinhua News Agency, along the Longhai Railway, prices fell rapidly after the People's Liberation Army occupied it. This is the result of the People's Liberation Army implementing extensive political reforms, which guarantee the stability of economic life in the liberated areas. The Kuomintang attempts to portray the so-called "universal suffrage" of the "National Assembly" it is putting on in its controlled areas as "democracy," but this deception has already failed. This "universal suffrage" is carried out under the reactionary dictatorship of the Kuomintang, under the conditions that the Kuomintang is carrying out an anti-people civil war, suppressing patriotic movements, and declaring all democratic parties and democratic groups "illegal." How can there be any "democracy"? The Chinese people have thoroughly exposed the Kuomintang's attempt to turn this "pseudo-election" into a performance of their own reactionary will, so as to "legitimize" their traitorous rule; therefore, the vast majority of the Chinese people unanimously boycott this pseudo-election.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: Soviet academician Avalin commented on the US imperialist policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek and invading China in the Soviet "New Times" magazine, saying: The United States is now attempting to use various agreements recently signed with the Kuomintang government to turn the entire China into an American military camp and colony. He pointed out that the Chiang-US "Relief Agreement" signed on October 27 clearly embodies the established steps of the United States in implementing the "Truman Doctrine" in China, and thereby seized supervisory power over the entire Kuomintang economy. But this cannot help the heinous and moribund Kuomintang reactionaries to gain a firm foothold. Since this spring, although the reactionary army has abundant American equipment and many American officers directly assisting, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has frequently won victories in battles with the reactionaries. The Kuomintang regime has fallen into a total collapse of politics, economy and military. After consuming billions of US dollars given by the US government, the Kuomintang is further away from the goals set by its American masters than ever before. The failure of the US policy toward China has recently been openly admitted by many confidants of US imperialism. Peter Ferial, a famous American expert on Far Eastern issues, in his article "It's Time to Leave China" (published in the June issue of American Harper's Magazine), concluded that "American policy toward China has hit a wall." In his judgment, American policy has strengthened the influence of the CCP and consolidated the international position of the Soviet Union. From the perspective of American interests, Peter Ferial believes that the only appropriate measure for the United States in the current situation in China is to immediately withdraw from China. Of course, it would be wrong to think that such articles will affect Washington's policies; it would also be naive to think that such articles do not include some kind of political conspiracy and trick. This only shows that after the US imperialism has hit a wall, some politicians are looking for new and better disguised ways to promote its policy of destroying China.

    莫斯科广播评中国形势：
    解放军全面发展反攻
    蒋匪陷于总崩溃境地
    【新华社陕北十二日电】莫斯科六日国语广播评中国形势称：在中国各条战线上，形势皆有利于人民解放军。华北人民解放军占领石家庄以后，在北战场继续发展攻势。解放军在华中也加强了进攻。在国民党国务会议上，蒋介石自己承认华中解放军的活动大大加强了，他声称：现时河南省有一半地方（按：实际上除开几个孤立据点外，河南全在解放军控制之下），湖北和安徽有三分之一的地方及江苏大部地区，皆在人民解放军控制之下。国民党的财政经济危机已白热化了，马歇尔在其外交委员会上承认，国民党的军费占其一切支出的百分之八十，国民党统治区内各地“法币”的贬值已到空前未有的程度，要十五万八千元才能换美元一块（按：本月十日曾达十六万）。国民党区的物价不断的在高涨着；十一月十八日申报传出的消息：四川市场的情形极端混乱，成都又倒闭了几家工厂。相反的，在解放区情形则显然不同，据新华社消息：在陇海铁路沿线上，当人民解放军进占后，物价即迅速下跌。这是人民解放军实行广泛政治改革的结果，这些民主改革保证了解放区经济生活的稳定。国民党企图把在其统治区所扮演的所谓“国民大会”的“普选”把戏说成什么“民主”，但是这种欺骗已经落空、这个“普选”是在国民党反动独裁下面进行的，是在国民党进行反人民内战、镇压爱国运动、宣布一切民主政党和民主团体“非法”的条件下进行的，这还谈得到什么“民主”呢？中国人民很好的揭穿了国民党的企图，只是将此次“普选”变成他们自己反动意志的表演，使他们的卖国统治得以“合法化”；因此中国广大人民一致抵制了这个伪选。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】苏联大学士阿瓦林于苏联“新时代”杂志上著文评论美帝国主义援蒋侵华政策称：美国现正企图利用最近与国民党政府签订的各种协定，把整个中国变为美国屯兵场和殖民地。他指出十月廿七日签订的蒋美“救济协定”，清楚体现了美国在中国实行“杜鲁门主义”的既定步骤，并由此攫取了对整个国民党经济的监督权。但这并不能帮助恶贯满盈气息奄奄的国民党反动派站稳脚跟。从今春开始，虽然反动派军队具有丰富的美国装备，且有许多美国军官直接帮助，但中国人民解放军在与反动派战斗中经常获得胜利。国民党政权已陷于政治经济和军事的总崩溃境地，在消耗了美国政府所给予的数十亿美元后，国民党离其美国主子所规定的目标，比以前任何时候都更远些。美国对华政策之失败，最近甚至很多美帝国主义者的亲信也都公开承认了。美国著名的远东问题专家彼菲尔在其题为“是离开中国的时候了”一文（发表于六月份美国哈普杂志）中，他得出结论说“美国对华政策是碰壁了”。据他的判断美国政策反而加强了中共的影响，同样巩固了与正在巩固着苏联的国际地位。彼菲尔从美国利益出发，认为在现在中国情况下，美国唯一合宜的措施，便是立即退出中国。当然，如果认为这类文章会影响华盛顿的政策，那就是错误的；如认为这类文章中并不包括某种一定的政治阴谋与诡计，那也是幼稚的。这只是说明美帝国主义在碰壁之后，某些政客正在寻找新的伪装得更好的道路以推行其灭华政策而已。
