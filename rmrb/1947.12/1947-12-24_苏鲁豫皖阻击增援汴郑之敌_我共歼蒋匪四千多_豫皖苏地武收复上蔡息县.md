Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Front, 22nd: The Front Headquarters issued Communiqué No. 30, stating: Before and after destroying the Longhai and Pinghan Railways, a part of our main force blocked the reinforcements of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Reorganized Division and Seventy-fifth Reorganized Division, achieving a significant victory. Since the 6th, the bandits have fled west from the Bo County-Jieshou line, attempting to reinforce Zhengzhou and Bian (Kaifeng). Afraid of being annihilated by our army, they advanced cautiously, only moving ten to twenty li per day, but could not escape the annihilation by our army. In the past ten days, our army has flexibly and mobilely blocked the enemy in the Fei River Estuary, Zhecheng, Taikang, Suixian, and Qixian areas, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 4,000 of them. As of the 16th, the enemy was still delayed on the Suiqi line. Our army gained ample time to successfully complete the task of destroying the two major railway lines.
