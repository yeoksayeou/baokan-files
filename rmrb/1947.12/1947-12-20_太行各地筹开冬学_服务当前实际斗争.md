    Taihang Area Prepares to Open Winter Schools
    to Serve Current Practical Struggle
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 13th] Taihang area is actively preparing to launch a mass winter school movement to serve the current practical struggle. The Third Administrative Office and the Fifth Prefectural Committee have issued winter school instructions one after another, emphasizing that this year's winter schools must serve the masses' current practical struggle: eliminate ideological obstacles in the masses' winter production, implement and strengthen current affairs education, and raise the masses' war consciousness to support the great counter-offensive, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and dig up the old roots; combine ideological mobilization of production and current affairs education to carry out cultural learning for young men and women. In terms of organizational leadership, it is proposed to transform the old leadership institutions, break the uniform old routine (one school per village, collective classes, concentrated on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of the month), elect a new leadership group with hired peasants and poor peasants as the backbone, adopt the method of mutual teaching and mutual learning, and combine with the masses' winter transportation, textile, and other production organizations and activities, and give play to the past experience of small group meetings as small winter schools and large group meetings as large winter schools. At present, winter schools in Licheng, Pingshun, and other places are adopting this method, electing a leadership group and voluntary teachers mainly composed of hired peasants and poor peasants through mass discussion, and beginning to learn. In order to quickly launch winter schools and better serve the current winter production movement, Lincheng in the First Special District is selecting activists from the emancipation and production movement in each village to serve as principals and teachers. The county government is also preparing to hold a short-term voluntary teaching conference in the near future to intensively train volunteer teachers and winter school principals. Winter school work in Bo'ai, Qinyang, and other counties in the Fourth Special District is also being arranged.

    太行各地筹开冬学
    服务当前实际斗争
    【本报太行十三日电】太行各地正积极筹备开展一个为当前实际斗争服务的群众性的冬学运动。日前三专署、五地委均先后发出冬学指示，强调指出今年冬学必须是服务于群众当前的实际斗争：扫除群众冬季生产中思想上存在的障碍，贯彻与加强时事教育，提高群众支援大反攻，打倒蒋介石，刨老根的战争观念；结合生产与时事教育的思想发动，开展青年男女的文化学习。在组织领导上则提出，要改造旧的领导机构，打破千篇一律老一套的（每村一座，集体上课，三、六、九集中）冬学形式，以雇贫为骨干，选举新的领导集团，采取互教互学的方式，结合群众冬季运输、纺织等生产组织与活动，发挥过去小组会为小冬学，大组会为大冬学的经验。目前黎城、平顺等地的冬学，即以此种做法，经过群众讨论，选举出以雇贫为主的领导集团及义教，开始学习。一专区临城为了使冬学迅速开展起来，更好的为当前冬季生产运动服务，各村正选择翻身与生产运动中积极分子，充当校长、教员。该县县府并准备于最近开一个短期义教会议，集训义务教员和冬学校长。四专区博爱、沁阳等县的冬学工作亦正在布置中。
