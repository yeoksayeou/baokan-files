  　Collecting Firewood and Manure for Military Families
    [Our newspaper's Lingcheng report] Under the personal leadership of village head Wu Hexiao, Liangko Village, in order to ensure that military families will not have difficulties in farming next year and to lay the foundation for next year's great production movement, mobilized the entire village on December 11th. They first collected manure for military families for one day. A total of 77 male laborers and 40 children participated. In one day, they collected more than 17,400 catties of manure for military families and distributed it to 12 military families. The villagers said: "They are fighting Lao Jiang outside to protect our safety. We should take good care of the military families and ensure that they will not have difficulties this winter and next spring." (Bao Rong, Pei Hui)
    [Our newspaper's Pingshun report] The masses in the Fourth District are cutting firewood to solve the problem of heating difficulties for military families in winter. The entire district has 591 households of military martyrs' families, 106 veterans, and 136 cadres' families. Yanggao Village cut more than 150,000 catties of firewood for the families of resistance members in five days. The entire district cut a total of 961,200 catties of firewood for the families of resistance members in seven days. During the firewood cutting in Beidanche Village, everyone discussed and proposed three major guarantees for preferential treatment of resistance members: (1) Guarantee to cultivate the land for the families of resistance members well, and not let the families of resistance members lack firewood to burn or water to drink. (2) Without the consent of the resistance army, divorce and termination of contracts cannot be carried out casually. (3) Family members of resistance members cannot be abused by outsiders, and wives of resistance members cannot be abused by their families, and resistance members must be respected. The villages also decided to accumulate fertilizer for the families of resistance members this winter. Now, various places are first having the sheep lie on the land of the families of resistance members. (Chang Suo, Zha Gen)
