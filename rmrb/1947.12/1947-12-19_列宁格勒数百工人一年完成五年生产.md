    (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 17th) Leningrad dispatch: In the great competition in Leningrad to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years, the first labor hero to create a miracle, machine worker Alexander Kovalev, has now completed and exceeded the entire Five-Year Plan. He designed many mechanization methods, shortening the labor process, so that work that originally required five years was completed in one year. Alexander Kovalev has become a model worker in Leningrad and throughout the Soviet Union. Countless Stakhanovite workers are rising up to emulate him. Currently, hundreds of workers in Leningrad have successively completed the entire Five-Year Plan. Under the leadership and influence of these labor heroes, workers in all industries and regions of the Soviet Union are full of confidence and are rushing to join the competitive upsurge to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years.
