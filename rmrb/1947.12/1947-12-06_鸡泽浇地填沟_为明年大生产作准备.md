　　Jize Irrigates Land and Fills Ditches
　　To Prepare for Next Year's Great Production
　　[Our Jinnan Dispatch, 4th] Jize is busy irrigating land. When the county summarized agricultural production, everyone deeply realized that the land irrigated last year, with large seedlings planted this year, yielded good harvests despite the drought. In Mengguan Village, 780 mu of land were irrigated and planted with large seedlings, with an average sorghum yield of five *dou* per mu. Wang Chengli planted four mu of millet and harvested three *shi* and nine *dou*, averaging seven and a half *dou* per mu; Zhaolin harvested six *shi* from seven *mu*. Conversely, corn planted before the wheat season without irrigation yielded an average of only three *dou* per mu, and some even abandoned the seeds. Practical experience has educated the peasants, so irrigation is a unanimous demand. To ensure smooth irrigation, with the help of leaders, several issues were resolved: (1) Because last year each village irrigated its own land, disputes easily arose. This year, under the leadership of the county construction department, an irrigation committee was organized for unified management, and these contradictions were eliminated. (2) Last year, many wheat fields were flooded due to the lack of dams during irrigation. For example, 300 mu were flooded in Wu Guanying. Chen Xinchang planted nine *mu* and only harvested five *dou*. High-lying areas could not be irrigated. This year, dams were built for irrigation piece by piece. (3) Some people disliked having too much water on their land and opened the sluices, flooding other people's wheat. Others disliked having too little water and stole water. This year, such as in the Second District, people are assigned to watch the water to prevent water theft and breaches.
　　[Further Dispatch] In order to expand cultivated land area and in response to the call to reclaim wasteland, the eight villages of Xiaozhai, Zhaozhuang, Huaiqiao, and Sihegou in the Second District of Jize are now simultaneously engaged in winter plowing and ditch filling. These ditches are roadside ditches left by the Japanese invaders, more than four *zhang* wide. In the area from Zhaobao to Sihegou belonging to the Second District, they extend as long as eleven *li*. Xiaozhai village alone has lost more than 300 *mu* of good farmland. It is a pity that it has been abandoned for years. The district mobilized ditch filling. Except for those plowing the land, all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers are fully mobilized to fill the ditches. Work began on the 18th, and everyone is very energetic because their thinking has been straightened out. Some say, "Our village is poor because of these ditches. How much less grain do we harvest each year?!" Some even work at night. Labor model Wang Yanqi filled one *zhang* and five *chi* in two days and one night.

### 鸡泽浇地填沟　为明年大生产作准备

　　鸡泽浇地填沟
  　为明年大生产作准备
    【本报冀南四日电】鸡泽正忙于浇地。该县总结农业生产时，大家都深刻体验到去年浇了地，今年按上大苗，虽遭旱灾，收成倒很好。孟贯庄浇地种了七百八十亩大苗，高粱平均五斗收。王成礼种了四亩谷子，收了三石九，每亩平均七斗半收；昭林七亩，打了六石。相反麦前未浇种的玉茭，平均每亩只三斗收，有的还扔了籽。实际经验教育了农民，所以浇地是大家一致要求。为顺利进行浇地，在领导帮助下，解决几个问题：（一）因为去年各村浇各村的，容易闹意见，今年在县建设科领导下，组织了浇地委员会，统一管理；这些矛盾便消除了；（二）去年浇地时因没筑坝，淹麦很多，吴官营即淹了三百亩，陈心常种了九亩，只收了五斗。高地还浇不着，今年筑起坝，一块块浇；（三）有的嫌自己地水多，通口子，把别人麦子淹死；有的嫌水小，偷水。今年如二区分头看水，以防止发生放水偷水及决口现象。
    【又电】鸡泽二区小砦、赵庄、槐桥、四河沟等八个村庄，为了扩大耕地面积，开荒口号，现在一面冬耕一面填沟，这个沟是日寇留下的护路沟，四丈多宽，在二区所属赵堡至四河沟，就长达十一里；仅小砦一村，即占去良田三百余亩；数年荒废，实为可惜。该区动员填沟，除犁地的人没有填沟任务外，其余整劳力半劳力全礼总突击平沟。十八日已开始动工，因为打通了思想，都很带劲。有的说：“俺村就穷到这沟上边了，一年少收多少粮食呀？！”有的在黑夜里还干，劳动模范王燕其，两天一夜填了一丈五。
