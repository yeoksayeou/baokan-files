　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st: Belated news, the Huaibei people's armed forces captured S County town on the afternoon of the 21st of last month in a one-hour battle, completely annihilating the defending enemy's eight county security squadrons and a large number of local reactionaries. This is a glorious example of the sub-district's main force capturing a county town. The Central China People's Liberation Army Command and Political Department sent a telegram of commendation, calling on the Central China troops and fraternal sub-districts to learn from them. (Note: S County town was once captured by Chen Su's army on November 12th, and then voluntarily transferred).
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st: The army and civilians of L County in Northern Jiangsu cooperated in combat, crushing the desperate "mopping-up" operation of four regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in three days, wiping out more than 230 enemies below the battalion commander level. On the 15th, three regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's 51st Division and one regiment of the reorganized 4th Division launched a seven-pronged attack on the heartland of the county. Before the enemy moved, the army and civilians of the county mobilized more than 13,000 people to heavily destroy the Huai (yin) Shu (yang) road, cutting off the enemy's main transportation line, and then mobilized the army and civilians of the entire county to prepare for war urgently, engaging the enemy everywhere. The sub-district's local armed forces launched a blocking battle against the enemy at Dawangzhuang, repelling the enemy's four assaults, killing and wounding 26 enemies below the battalion commander level. The militia in the Kuaho River area even maneuvered to insert themselves into the enemy's encirclement, killing and capturing seven enemies. Other district teams also attacked in all directions, and the enemy was trapped in a fire net. The enemy, suffering losses and retreating to Gaozongji, burned large fires all night to embolden themselves and dared not fall asleep. On the 17th, a unit of the local armed forces killed and wounded more than 30 enemies near Shaiyuan. At the same time, armed forces at all levels also launched external attacks. On the 15th, a unit of the sub-district's local armed forces attacked Gaoliu, an important town on the Shu (yang) Xin (an town) line, wiping out 170 enemies. The Tongyang County working team also coordinated to attack the enemy stronghold of Yinping on the Shu Xin line. At this point, the enemy's deployment was greatly disrupted, and they hurriedly shrunk back to their strongholds on the 17th.
　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st: In the battle to capture Gaomi on the 27th of last month, the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the defending enemy's 477th Regiment of the 159th Brigade of the Reorganized 64th Division, as well as the Chiang Kai-shek county government security team, "Homecoming Corps" and other units. According to preliminary investigations, a total of 1,417 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, including Chen Jie, the commander of the 477th Regiment, were captured alive, and more than 400 bandits below the battalion commander level were killed or wounded. Seven mortars, thirty-six 60mm guns and rocket launchers, one hundred and five light machine guns, four hundred and eighty-nine rifles and carbines, and a large amount of other ammunition and military supplies were seized.
