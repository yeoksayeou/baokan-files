　　Poor Women Face Many Difficulties in Spinning and Weaving Due to Lack of Capital and Tools
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] During a survey on spinning and weaving in Bubo Village, Lincheng, it was discovered that poor and hired women face the following difficulties. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to solving these problems in future spinning and weaving campaigns:
　　1. Want to work but lack capital. Some poor and hired women who really want to spin and weave cannot raise the capital. For example, Fan Lanni, the wife of Li Junsheng in this village (a poor peasant who used to work in a kiln), had to borrow from various sources to scrape together 14,000 yuan to start spinning and weaving. There are many other households like this. 2. Want to spin and weave but lack tools. In the past, when we investigated spinning and weaving tools, we often said that a certain village had so many spinning wheels and so many looms, but the class-based investigation was insufficient. Some poor and hired families shared one machine among four or five families. If they want to weave, they don't have the tools. For example, the families of Li Junsheng and Wu Yutang in this village share one machine among four families. 3. Shortage of raw materials: Not enough cotton thread is available. The spinners in the village all go to Yageying, Gaoyi, and Sunjiazhuang to buy cotton, and sometimes they can't even buy it, wasting their time and labor. In order to smoothly carry out the spinning and weaving campaign, the following suggestions are proposed for everyone to discuss: (1) Credit cooperatives in various villages should consciously lend money to poor and hired households to solve their difficulties in production capital. (2) Carpenter shops in various village cooperatives should rush to make spinning wheels and looms to sell or lend to poor and hired households, who can repay the loans after earning money through production. (3) Cooperatives should also find ways to purchase cotton thread to solve the raw material shortage.

### 本钱少、工具缺贫妇纺织困难多

　　本钱少、工具缺贫妇纺织困难多
    【本报讯】临城在调查哺要村纺织中，发现贫雇有以下几个困难，提出希大家今后在纺织运动中注意解决：
    一、想干没本钱。贫雇妇女有的真正想纺织就弄不起本钱，如本村李俊生老婆范兰妮（贫农过去下窑），在纺织时东家倒西家借七凑八凑，才算弄了一万四千元干起纺织来，其他类似这样的户还多哩。二、想纺织没工具，过去我们在调查纺织工具时，往往是说某某村有多少纺花车多少织布机，但阶级性的调查不够，有的贫雇四五家合使着一张机，想织没工具，如本村李俊生、吴玉堂家就都四家合着一张机。三、原料缺少：棉花线子不够使用，该村的纺妇都到鸭鸽营高邑孙家庄买花，有时还买不到白跑腿浪费劳力。为使纺织运动顺利开展，并提出以下意见给大家商量：（一）各村信用社的贷款应有意识的贷给贫雇户解决它们生产资本的困难，（二）各村合作社的木匠铺应赶制些纺车织机卖给贫雇或贷给贫雇，经生产以后赚下钱再归还。（三）合作社并设法购买棉花线子解决原料困难。
