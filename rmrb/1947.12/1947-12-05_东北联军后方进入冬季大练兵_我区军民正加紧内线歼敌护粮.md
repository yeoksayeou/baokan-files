Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. December - Comprehensive War Report for the Week of November 27th to December 3rd:

    Northeast: The headquarters of the Democratic Allied Forces announced the results of the autumn offensive. In the 50 days from September 14th to November 5th, a total of over 69,000 enemies were annihilated, the liberated area was expanded by more than 38,000 square kilometers, and over 2.6 million people were liberated. The enemy was forced into a completely passive position, adopting a policy of shrinking back and relying on key defenses. Currently, the rear of the Allied Forces has entered an unprecedented large-scale winter military training movement. The masses in the new areas, under the slogan of "One hand holding a gun, the other hand distributing land," are sweeping away bandits, searching for illegal firearms, and launching a vigorous land distribution movement. Local troops continue to attack; on the 24th, they recaptured Lishu City; on the 27th, they captured Changtu City three times. Local armed forces in southern Rehe and eastern Hebei are active in the vicinity of Chengde and Tianjin, repeatedly inflicting casualties on the enemy.
    East China: The war situation has greatly changed. After recovering Jiaoxian County, our troops in Jiaodong captured Gaomi City on the 27th, completely annihilating a regular army regiment and 1,800 local troops and other miscellaneous forces. After annihilating over 1,300 enemies on the periphery, our troops in Bohai captured Shouguang City on the 24th. Over 200 li of the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway is completely under our control, and the Jiaodong, Luzhong, and Binhai liberated areas, which were once separated, are now connected again. Since the large-scale offensive launched by the Chiang bandits against Jiaodong in August, nearly 40,000 of their regular troops alone have been annihilated. Currently, the Chiang bandits in Jiaodong are compressed into a narrow coastal line from Longkou and Yantai to Weihaiwei, and isolated cities such as Haiyang and Laiyang, with their land retreat routes cut off. The Chiang bandits who re-occupied Weihai are trapped in our constant siege. A platoon of officers and soldiers of the Chiang bandits in Yantai have revolted, bringing their weapons to join the People's Liberation Army. The Chiang bandits' delusion of seizing the entire Jiaodong and handing it over to the American imperialists three months ago has been shattered. The Associated Press also admitted: "The situation in the past few weeks shows that the Communists now hold as much territory as before," and "Communist troops can move at will." With the start of the national counter-offensive, the troops and civilians who have independently persisted in the struggle behind Chiang's lines in central China have transformed into a flank on the southern front north of the Yangtze River, becoming a component of the Liu-Deng and Chen-Su two-pronged counter-offensive forces. Since the Battle of Yeting City in August, over 27,000 enemies have been annihilated, 169 towns and cities have been recovered, and over 10,000 square li of lost territory has been restored. The Chiang bandits launched a desperate "mopping-up" operation with four regiments in Lianshui, but under the joint attack of the local troops and civilians, they retreated to their original strongholds with injuries three days later. The Huaibei People's Armed Forces captured Sixian City in one hour of fighting on the 21st of last month, completely annihilating the defending enemy. The victorious development of the counter-offensive in Central China has effectively coordinated with the various armies on the western front.
    Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi: Our troops on the eastern front recaptured Nanzhao on the 21st of last month, and recpatured Lushan on the 23rd. Chiang's bandits in both cities fled at the mere sound of the wind. On the 26th, Shangdian, southwest of Yiyang, was liberated, annihilating over 900 enemies, including regimental commanders and battalion commanders; on the same day, we crushed the 20th Division's attack in Fangcheng, annihilating over 250 enemies. On the 27th, Yichuan City was recaptured, capturing over 80 enemies, including battalion commanders, and killing or wounding over 40. Guerrilla warfare is extremely active on all fronts. More than 700 miscellaneous bandits and scattered bandits were wiped out in ten days, and many Chiang bandit strongholds were captured. Wherever our troops go, farmers bring their own weapons and demand to join the army to oppose Chiang. According to statistics from a certain district along the Luohe River alone, more than 800 people have joined the local armed forces and militia.
    Hubei-Henan-Anhui: Our troops recaptured key towns such as Xinzhou and Sandian in the Huangpi and Huanggang areas on the 20th, capturing over 30 enemies. Another unit repeatedly repelled the enemy's offensives in Liuzigang and other places, capturing over 30 enemies. On the 27th, our troops ambushed and routed about a Chiang bandit battalion in western Guangshan, killing or wounding 300 and capturing over 100. The people's armed forces in southern Henan and western Anhui are actively cooperating with the Liberation Army to suppress bandits, repeatedly winning victories. The local armed forces in Macheng, Jingfu, and Taihu alone annihilated 500 bandits in five days from the 19th to the 23rd.
    Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui: In the battle to capture Yutai on the 19th of last month, our troops annihilated over 2,500 enemies. Under the protection of the Liberation Army, farmers in eastern Henan have established various organizations to turn the tables, demanding blood debts from landlords and bullies.
    Jin-Cha-Ji: Our troops captured many strongholds on the periphery of Baoding. At the same time, our local troops active in the Pingjin-Bao triangle area captured Matou Town, 80 li southeast of Beiping, in one fell swoop, causing great threat to the rear of the Chiang bandits occupying Ba County and other places. The transportation on the railway between Ping and Bao has been cut off by our local armed forces' sabotage. More than 100 Chiang bandits who escaped north from Shijiazhuang were completely annihilated in Xinle. The democratic governments of Shijiazhuang, Zhengding, and Huolu, which were recently liberated and recovered, are making every effort to carry out restoration and relief work. Chiang can only vent his hopeless feelings of no return by continuously bombing the peaceful residents of Shijiazhuang, and use the reorganization of the North China Military Command to cover up his failure, while escaping the threat of the Liberation Army by "(Chiang's) provincial government withdrawing from Baoding" (French News Agency) and airlifting 25 tons of cotton from the China Textile Company from Baoding to Beiping daily (United Press report).
    Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu: Military and civilians in various places are intensifying their efforts to annihilate the enemy in the inner lines and protect grain. In mid-last month, the Taiyue local armed forces repelled two divisions of Yan bandits robbing grain in northern Qinyuan, annihilating over 200 enemies below the battalion commander level. On the 18th, our troops in Ji-Lu-Yu captured the Shihueng stronghold (under the jurisdiction of Feicheng County), capturing over 500 puppet district chiefs and others. The three county towns of Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Boai in northern Henan established a joint grain protection command to strengthen the fight against the Chiang bandits' grain robbery conspiracy. In the triangular area between the Longhai, Jinpu, and Yellow Rivers, our troops, in coordination with the great counter-offensive, have transformed from guerrilla warfare to small-scale annihilation warfare and fortress assault against the enemy, gradually recovering Chiang-occupied areas and opening up new areas.
    Northwest: Our troops advanced into Sanbian, pursuing the fleeing bandits of Ma Hongkui's troops. On the 25th, Ningtiaoliang Town was recovered, and on the 29th, Anbian City was recovered. In addition to inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, over 60 enemies were captured.
    Jin-Sui: Our local armed forces attacked the Yan bandits southwest of Datong on the 27th, annihilating nearly 100 enemies, including six Japanese officers.

　　东北联军后方进入冬季大练兵
    我区军民正加紧内线歼敌护粮
    【新华社陕北三日电】十一月二十七日至十二月三日一周综合战报：
    东北：民主联军总部宣布秋季攻势战绩、自九月十四日至十一月五日之五十天内，共歼敌六万九千余众，扩大解放区面积三万八千余方公里，解放人民二百六十余万。迫使敌人完全处于被动，采取龟缩政策，依托重点防御。现联军后方已进入空前规模的冬季大练兵运动。新区群众则在“一手拿枪，一手分地”的口号下，扫荡胡匪，查黑枪，掀起轰轰烈烈的分地运动。地方部队仍不断出击，二十四日再度攻克梨树城，二十七日三次攻克昌图城，热南、冀东地武活跃承德、天津近郊，屡予敌以杀伤。
    华东：战局大为改观。胶东我军继收复胶县之后，又于二十七日攻克高密城，全歼守敌正规军一个团及土杂等一千八百余名。渤海我军于外围歼敌一千三百余名后，二十四日攻克寿光城。胶济路东段二百余里完全为我控制，曾一度被分隔之胶东、鲁中、滨海解放区又联成一片。蒋匪自八月大举进攻胶东以来，仅其正规军被歼者即近四万人。现胶东蒋匪被压缩于龙口、烟台至威海卫沿海狭长一线及海阳、莱阳等孤城内，陆上退路已被切断。再度侵踞威市蒋匪陷入我不断困袭中。烟台蒋匪已有一排官兵起义，携械投奔解放军。三个月前，蒋匪妄图事囊括胶东全境拱手送与美帝的迷梦已告幻灭。美联社亦承认：“过去数周来的局势，显示共产党现握有如从前一样多的地区”，“共军部队可以任意行动”。随着全国大反攻的开始，独立坚持华中蒋后斗争的军民，一变而为长江北岸南线战场的一个侧翼，成为刘邓、陈粟两路反攻大军的一个组成部分。自八月叶挺城战役以来，已歼敌二万七千余，收复城镇一百六十九处，恢复失地一万余方里。蒋匪在涟水以四个团兵力进行挣扎性的“扫荡”，在当地军民联合打击下，三天后即负伤缩回原据点。淮北人民武装于上月二十一日，以一小时战斗攻克泗县城，全歼守敌。华中反攻的胜利开展，有力地配合了西线各路大军。
    豫鄂陕：东线我军于上月二十一日再克南召，二十三日再克鲁山，两城蒋匪均闻风逃遁。二十六日解放伊阳西南之上店，歼敌团长大队长以下九百余名；同日我在方城粉碎敌第二十师的进犯，歼敌二百五十余名，二十七日再克伊川城，俘敌大队长以下八十余，毙伤四十余。西线我军二十五日于山阳西部击溃由镇安东犯之蒋匪整六五师一个旅，予敌以重大杀伤。各线游击战极为活跃，十天内剿灭杂顽散匪七百余，攻克蒋匪据点多处。我军所到之处，农民纷纷自带武器要求参军反蒋，仅据洛河沿岸某分区统计，即有八百余人参加地武与民兵。
    鄂豫皖：我军二十日于黄陂、黄冈地区再克新洲及三店市等重镇，俘敌三十余；另部在柳子港等地数次击溃敌之进犯，俘敌三十余。二十七日我军在光山西击溃敌约一营，毙伤三百，俘百余。豫南、皖西各地人民武装配合解放军积极剿匪，屡获胜利。仅麻城、经扶、太湖地方武装十九至二十三五天内，即歼匪五百余。
    苏鲁豫皖：我军上月十九日攻克鱼台之战，歼敌二千五百余。豫东农民在解放军保卫下，纷纷成立各种翻身组织，向地主恶霸索还血债。
    晋察冀：我军攻克保定外围据点多处，同时活跃于平津保三角地区之我地方部队，一举攻克北平东南八十里之马头镇，使侵占霸县等地之蒋匪后方感受极大威胁。平保间铁路在我地武破击下，交通已告断绝。由石庄漏网北逃之蒋匪百余人，在新乐全部就歼。新近解放与收复之石庄、正定、获鹿等城市民主政府，正全力进行恢复与救抚工作，蒋贼只能以连续轰炸石庄的和平居民来泄其一去不复返的绝望情绪，并以改组华北军事指挥部来为其失败遮羞，同时用“（蒋记）省政府由保定撤退”（法新闻社），每日由保定空运中纺公司棉花二十五吨到北平（合众社讯）的办法，来逃避解放军的威胁。
    晋冀鲁豫：各地军民正加紧内线歼敌与护粮斗争。太岳地武上月中旬于沁源北境击退抢粮阎匪两个师，歼敌营长以下二百余。冀鲁豫我军十八日攻克石横（肥城县属）据点，俘伪区长以下五百余。豫北修武、武陟、博爱三县城成立护粮联防指挥部，加强打击蒋匪抢粮阴谋。在陇海、津浦与黄河间三角地带，我军配合大反攻，已由游击战转为对敌小型歼灭战与攻坚战，逐步收复蒋占区开辟新地区。
    西北：我军挺进三边，追击马鸿逵部逃匪，于二十五日收复宁条梁镇，二十九日收复安边城，除予敌重大杀伤外，并俘敌六十余名。
    晋绥：我地武二十七日于大同西南袭击阎匪，歼敌近百，内俘日军官六名。
