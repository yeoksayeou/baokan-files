[This dispatch from our newspaper's Henan-Shandong-Hebei office on the 25th] Our correspondent comments on the military situation south of the Yellow River: In the past month, in the vast triangular area between the Longhai Railway, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and the Yellow River, we have concentrated our superior forces, coordinated with the great counter-offensive, and launched heroic attacks, shifting from guerrilla warfare to organized small-scale annihilation battles and siege warfare against the enemy. We are advancing towards the border areas and enemy-occupied areas, recovering lost territories and opening up new areas. In the vast guerrilla areas of more than ten counties south of the Yellow River, there are now only about 50,000 regular KMT bandits who have been annihilated before, and less than 80,000 including their "Home-Returning Legions" and local miscellaneous forces. In the First Military Sub-district (Tai'xi Sub-district), the KMT bandits have the heaviest concentration of troops, but there are still only the 73rd Division and the 15th Brigade and 37th Brigade in Tai'an, Feicheng, Pingyin, and Dong'e. The Second and Fifth Military Sub-districts only have the 181st Brigade of the 55th Division stationed in Heze, and they are now in a state of panic. The 41st Brigade and 11th Brigade scattered along the Longhai Railway fled to Lanfeng when our Chen-Su army breached the Longhai Railway. The Provisional 84th Brigade was forced to abandon Juye on the 12th and fled to Xuzhou. In the Huxi Sub-district, there are only two regiments of the 70th Division, and the 139th Brigade has now shrunk to Jinxiang and Fengxian, not daring to come out. The KMT army south of the Yellow River is in a state of emptiness, isolation, and without reinforcements. Under this favorable situation, our local armed forces are launching small-scale annihilation battles and siege warfare against the KMT bandits. The militia and security teams of the Huxi Sub-district have emerged from the tunnels and, in coordination with the local corps, captured Zhao Zhuangji, a major stronghold west of Fengxian city, annihilating more than 200 KMT bandits and liberating the vast area of Huxi. The city of Shanxian in the Huxi Sub-district has never been occupied by the KMT bandits since January of this year due to the persistent struggle of the people's armed forces. Our struggle against the enemy in the Seventh Military Sub-district has entered a new phase. In the battle to capture Jiaxiang on the 18th, more than 500 enemies were annihilated. Except for the isolated strongholds around Dongping and Wenshang, the vast countryside of Jianan, Jiabei, west of the Grand Canal, and east of Dongping Lake, with hundreds of thousands of people, has been liberated again. The local armed forces of the Seventh Military Sub-district are also sweeping the Jinshan and Woniu Mountain areas northeast of Liangshanbo, removing several KMT bandit strongholds. In the Battle of Woniu Mountain alone, more than 150 men of the regular KMT 73rd Division were annihilated. The local armed forces in the area also advanced between Jia (xiang) and Ji (ning), sweeping across the KMT bandits. More than ten strongholds west of Jining, such as Ershilipu, were all removed. The local armed forces of the Fifth Military Sub-district have grown in strength during the land reform and seesaw guerrilla warfare. The joint defense lines are as dense as spider webs. Currently, the "Ma Zhenqing Working Team" has advanced to the suburbs of Heze. The armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district annihilated a battalion of regular KMT bandits in the Linpu battle at the beginning of the month, capturing 300 enemies. The local armed forces in Taixi, which are in a more difficult situation, have shattered the brutal "encirclement and suppression" of the KMT bandit 73rd Division, 15th Brigade, and the Third Security Brigade in the past month, and have turned to the offensive. Our militia armed forces launched an offensive towards the mountainous area of Feicheng on the 18th, and our army annihilated two district departments and eight town offices in Shiheng Town, Feicheng, capturing more than 500 enemies below the district chief in one fell swoop. Currently, except for Linze, which is a border area, there are no enemy traces in the Second Military Sub-district. In the arduous struggle against the enemy, the local armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district have equipped themselves with the American weapons "sent" by the KMT bandits. The militia of Juancheng have American light and heavy machine guns, and the ammunition is sufficient. They are now ready to attack at any time.
