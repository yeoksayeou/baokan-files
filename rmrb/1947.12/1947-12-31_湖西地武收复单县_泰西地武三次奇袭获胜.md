　　[This Dispatch from our Newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 29th] Our local troops have recovered Dan County. Since the 24th of last month, when Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Provisional 88th Division and parts of the Parachute Column invaded and occupied my Dan County, our Lake West local armed forces harassed them daily. The enemy occupied it for only twenty days, and on the 13th, they fled south in a panic. Our Dan County and eastern Dan County areas have thus restored democratic order.

　　[This Dispatch from our Newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 28th] The local armed forces of our West Tai Sub-district and the Fourth District Work Team of West Tai County, in one day and night, amidst heavy snow, raided Chiang Kai-shek's bandits at Huangshuiwan, capturing 17 enemy soldiers. On the second night, they also infiltrated the Gengjiazhuang area in the northern section of the Tai'an-Feicheng Highway, and encircled and suppressed the home-returning legions in Yuchixi Xianjiazhuang and other places. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Changqing gathered more than 700 troops and began looting grain in our Tiger Head Mountain area on the 8th. A part of our local armed forces immediately counterattacked, killing four enemy soldiers, and the enemy could not withstand the attack and fled.

　　[This Dispatch from our Newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 26th] After the peasants of × Garden in the Fourth District of Kaocheng in the Fifth Sub-district received land, they actively demanded to be armed, dig tunnels, and build bunkers to protect the land they had received. In one day, they dug the ditch from × Village to × Garden, and also dug 40 fortifications, caves and bunkers. The three days' work was completed in two days. After the tunnels were dug, eighteen young people from × Garden voluntarily organized a militia team to actively defend their homes. Liu Sichang's troops of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang raided × Garden twice, but were repelled by the militia.
