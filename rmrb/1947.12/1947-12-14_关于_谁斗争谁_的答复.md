    Reply Regarding "Who Struggles Against Whom"
    Editor's Note: Although Comrade Shang Cunzhong admits his mistake, he does not sufficiently recognize the seriousness of this mistake. The three points of explanation clearly do not align with the spirit of self-criticism. It is hoped that he can engage in a more profound ideological self-examination.

To the Editorial Staff:

    Regarding the article "Who Struggles Against Whom" published in the People's Daily on October 19th, I now offer the following reply:

      I. There are three points in the article that are inconsistent with the facts or are misunderstandings. I will first provide clarification:

    (1) Zhao Guangxian participated in the procurement office work as early as 1938. Later, he was detained by the enemy in Nanhui Village for requesting funds and became a plainclothes agent. He soon escaped and, after being investigated by our Anti-Japanese County Government (the time from being detained to being investigated and released was only half a year), returned to work at the procurement office. He did not "infiltrate Xingtai City after liberation" as stated in the article.

    (2) The masses came to demand Zhao Guangxian a total of two times. Because some of his economic procedures were scattered in various locations and could not be cleared up in a short time, the delay lasted for twenty-six days. After the settlement, we voluntarily sent him back to the village. It was not the case that "the procurement office always shielded him and refused to let him return" as stated in the article after "repeated negotiations."

    (3) The masses demanded that Zhao Guangxian pay 650,000 yuan in three days. According to our information, he had 330,000 yuan in shares in Nangong, 60,000 yuan in cash, and a bicycle and a leather jacket, totaling 650,000 yuan. In order to resolve the issue as soon as possible, we advanced him 650,000 yuan.

    II. Our self-criticism:

    Zhao Guangxian worked in the procurement office for eight or nine years. He had strong work ability and completed tasks quickly. Therefore, we always considered him a good cadre and valued him relatively highly. However, we did not pay attention to the fact that he was a landlord. This indicates that our class consciousness was blurred. When the masses demanded him, our position was still unclear, and we indulged him, reluctant to let him go. Therefore, we tried to save him and mediate. This affected the in-depth development of the mass movement. For the same purpose, we advanced him 650,000 yuan to help him capture another special agent landlord in Daming (capturing this special agent was one of the conditions for the masses to release Zhao Guangxian). What we did was to help the landlord Zhao Guangxian escape mass control, making us his air-raid shelter. After seeing the article "Who Struggles Against Whom" in the Fifth District, we suddenly realized that we were unconsciously standing on the landlord's position, sheltering the landlord. We feel very sorry to the masses. This is a great education for us. We will definitely pay close attention in the future, correct our position, and serve the people. As for Zhao Guangxian, we have already sent him back to the village.

    关于“谁斗争谁”的答复
    编者按：尚存忠同志虽承认错误，但对这一错误的严重性认识不足，三点说明，显然与检讨精神不符。希望能在思想上更作深刻检讨。编辑同志：
    人民日报十月十九日发表谁斗争谁一稿，现作答复：
      一、该稿中有三点与事实不符或系误会，先作说明：
    （一）赵光先于一九三八年即参加采办处工作，后因要款在南会村被敌扣住，当了便衣，不久即跑出，经我抗日县政府审查后（由被扣到审查释放为时仅半年），又回采办处工作，并非如该稿所说：“解放后钻入邢市”。
    （二）群众来要赵光先，前后共两次，因他有些经济手续，散处各地，短时清理不出，共延缓二十六天，结清后，我们自动送他回村。并非如该稿所说：“三番五次交涉，采办处总是包庇不让回来”。
    （三）群众清算赵光先六十五万元，限期三天交清，我们根据他在南宫有股金三十三万元，现款六万，及自行车一辆、皮衣一件，共合六十五万元，为了及早解决问题，就为其垫出六十五万元。
    二、我们检讨：
    赵光先在采办处前后八九年，工作能力强，完成任务较快，因此，我们一向认为他是个好干部，比较重视，而未注意他是个地主，这一点说明我们阶级意识模糊。在群众要他时，我们的立场仍不明确，姑息他，舍不得放走他，因此，我们曾设法挽救，斡旋调停，影响群众运动的深入。为了同样的目的，我们又给他垫款六十五万元，帮助他到大名捉拿另一个特务地主（捉拿此特务为群众释放赵光先条件之一）。我们所做所为，是帮助地主赵光先脱离群众管制，成了他的防空洞。看到五区谁斗争谁一稿后，才恍然大悟，原来我们不自觉的站在地主立场上，包庇了地主，很觉对不起群众，这是对我们一个很大的教育，今后一定很好注意，端正立场，为人民服务，至于赵光先，我们已送回村了。
