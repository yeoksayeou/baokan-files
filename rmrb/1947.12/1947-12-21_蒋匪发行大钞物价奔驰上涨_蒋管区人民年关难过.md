Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 18th: According to reports from various sources, due to the issuance of new banknotes and the implementation of "economic emergency measures," the people in Chiang-controlled areas are facing a serious threat of soaring prices as the New Year approaches. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's issuance of 20,000, 40,000, and 100,000 yuan banknotes on the 10th of this month marks a new development in the Chiang Kai-shek clique's vicious inflation. By the 13th of this month, the black market exchange rate for US dollars had exceeded 160,000 yuan. The prices of imported goods are also soaring. The price of domestic products initially rose more slowly, but rice has broken through the 1 million yuan mark per dan, an increase of 17 times compared to the rice price in January of this year. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has further intensified its terrorist repression, and a large number of merchants have been arrested. Prices are still rising in fluctuations. Rice and flour were forced to fall in price some days ago, but on the 15th, they rebounded to new highs. A foreign news agency described the situation in the Shanghai market on the 11th after the Chiang Kai-shek clique issued large denomination banknotes as follows: "The black market exchange rate immediately rose to a new height, which in turn affected the trading of goods and stocks. It has become difficult to distinguish between cause and effect, and the prices of various commodities have begun a frantic race of inflation, chasing each other." The financial community pointed out that the great chaos of inflation in Chiang-controlled areas caused by the new banknotes is already in front of us.

Before the issuance of large denomination banknotes, the Four Families' (Chiang, Soong, Kung, Chen) financial institution, the Joint Treasury, suddenly decided on November 28th to stop lending and remittances. On the surface, this was an "economic emergency measure to prevent hoarding." Its real effect, however, was to prohibit normal industrial and commercial transactions and to suppress prices with economic measures of terror, forcing the low-price sale of goods so that the bureaucratic capital of the Four Families could extract large amounts of materials from the people with its worthless paper money and hoard them in anticipation of higher prices to exchange for greater profits. This is the Four Families' consistent old trick of sucking the blood of the people, and this sinful act is bound to further drive up prices as the New Year approaches.

　　蒋匪发行大钞物价奔驰上涨
  　蒋管区人民年关难过
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据各方报导：由于新钞的发行及“经济紧急措施”的实施，蒋管区人民已面临着年关物价狂涨的严重威胁。本月十日蒋匪二万、四万及十万元大钞的发行，标志着蒋匪恶性通货膨胀的新发展，至本月十三日止，黑市美汇已超出十六万元，进口货价格也向上奔驰，土产上涨开始时速度虽较缓慢，但大米每担已冲破一百万元大关，较本年一月米价涨达十七倍之多。近日蒋匪更疯狂加强恐怖镇压，大批商人横遭逮捕，物价仍作起伏性上涨，米和面日前曾被迫下跌，十五日又重新上涨至新高峰。某外国通讯社描写蒋匪大钞发行后十一日上海市场的情形称：“黑市汇率立即提高到新高度，从而又影响商品与股票的交易，一会儿已变得分不出因和果，各种物价的行情，开始一个追逐一个作着疯狂膨胀竞赛。”金融界指出：新钞所引起蒋管区又一次通货膨胀的大混乱，已摆在面前。
    蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族的金融机关四联总处在此次发行大钞前，于上月二十八日突然决定停止放款、汇兑，表面上是“防止囤积”的经济紧急措施，其真正作用却是禁止正常工商业交易，并以经济措施的恐怖手段压抑物价，迫使低价抛出货物以便于四大家族官僚资本以其不值钱的纸币榨取民间大量物资，囤积起来以待在物价更高涨时换得更多的利润。这是四大家族一贯吮吸民脂民膏的老手法，同时此一罪恶行为又必然更推动年关物价上涨。
