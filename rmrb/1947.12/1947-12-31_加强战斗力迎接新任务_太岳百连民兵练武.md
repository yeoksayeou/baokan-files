　　Strengthening Combat Effectiveness to Meet New Tasks
  　Taiyue Region Hundred-Company Militia Practice Martial Arts
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 29th] On the eve of the New Year, the militias of over twenty counties in the region have successively launched a winter training campaign, preparing to meet new battles and welcome the unprecedented great victory of the people's liberation. Apart from those on remote expeditions and rotations, more than one hundred militia field companies are participating in the training. The movement started in Yangcheng, Qinshui, and other counties, and then Jincheng, Gaoping, Fushan, Jiyuan, Mengxian, Yuanqu, Zhaocheng, Huoxian, Changzi, Tunliu, Anze, Qinyuan, Pingyao, Wenxi, and more than twenty other counties also joined in successively, concentrating training by county and district, and it has now entered a climax. In order to make this work better, all counties have established many necessary organizations. For example, Anze established a teaching and research association, and Gaoping County trained field company cadres in advance, which made the training work proceed more smoothly.
    In this training movement, the first is to improve class consciousness, uniformly recognize that the militia is a class armed force, clean up the targets of struggle and local ruffians, and purify the militia organization. Secondly, take hired and poor peasants as the backbone, and absorb a large number of hired and poor peasants to participate in leadership.
    In terms of teaching methods, the old-fashioned practice of training on the playground has been broken, with the wilderness as the classroom and various natural objects as teaching materials, learning combat tactics by combining practice and theory, and explaining while practicing. The military quality of the militia has been further improved with the development of the situation and the requirements of the development of militia technology, and the study of the three major technologies has been further enhanced. For example, the Yangcheng militia uses a combination of learning and application to learn how to use terrain and terrain features, and various leaping methods of movement under enemy fire. One group performs and everyone watches, and after the performance, everyone evaluates the advantages and disadvantages, and proposes how to promote the advantages and correct the disadvantages, and then performs again and evaluates again immediately. At the same time, most counties also adopt mutual assistance, mutual learning, officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, you teach me, I teach you mutual learning and mutual research, and if you don’t know it, ask “Zhuge Liang” to study and solve it. In the class, mix people who know how with those who don't to form mutual assistance groups for mutual learning.
    In such a situation, the morale of the militiamen is getting higher and higher, and their enthusiasm is getting greater and greater. The Yecheng Yemingzhu Company and the Qinshui Zhao Wenhong Battalion, etc., have just returned from remote expeditions and immediately threw themselves into rectification and training. Many county cadres also participated together, studying and practicing hard. For example, Qinshui County Staff Officer Zhang Zunjiang and District Directors Tian Zhiyi, Zhang Daohong, etc., all participated in martial arts training without missing a single exercise or lesson. In Qinshui, Yangcheng, Tunliu and other counties, thousands of martial arts activists have emerged.

### 加强战斗力迎接新任务　太岳百连民兵练武

　　加强战斗力迎接新任务
  　太岳百连民兵练武
    【本报太岳二十九日电】在新年前夕，全区二十余县民兵，先后掀起冬季大练兵，准备迎接新的战斗，迎接人民解放空前伟大的胜利。除远征轮战者外，有一百多个民兵野战连参加练兵。运动首由阳城、沁水等县展开，接着晋城、高平、浮山、济源、孟县、垣曲、赵城、霍县、长子、屯留、安泽、沁源、平遥、闻喜二十余县也相继卷入，以县区为单位集中训练，现已进入高潮。为使这一工作搞的更好，各县都成立了许多必要的组织，如安泽成立了教学研究会，高平县则事先训练野战连干部，因之使训练工作更顺利进行。
    在这次练兵运动中，首先是提高阶级觉悟，一致认识了民兵是阶级武装，清洗了斗争对象与地痞流氓，纯洁了民兵组织。其次，以雇贫为骨干，大量吸收雇贫参加领导。
    在教学的方法上，打破了操场练兵的老一套，以野外为课堂，各种自然物作教材，一边演习一边讲解学用结合来学习战斗教练。民兵的军事素养随着形势的发展与民兵技术发展的要求，已把三大技术学习更进一步的提高。如阳城民兵就是以学用结合的办法，学习利用地形地物，在敌火力下运动的各种跃进办法，一组演习大家参观，演习完了大家评定优缺点，并提出如何发扬优点改正缺点，马上再来演习再来评定。同时，各县又大都采用互助、互学、官教兵、兵教官、你教我、我教你互相学习互相研究，不会了就请“诸葛亮”研究解决。在班内把会的与不会的人混合组成互助小组，互相学习。
    在这样的情况下，民兵们的情绪越来越高，劲头也越来越大，阳城夜明珠连、沁水赵文宏营等都是刚刚远征回来，马上就投入整训。许多县的干部也一块参加，苦学苦练。如沁水县会参谋张遵江及区主任田支义、张道宏等，都不误一操一课参加练武。沁水、阳城、屯留等县，涌现出成千成百练武积极分子。
