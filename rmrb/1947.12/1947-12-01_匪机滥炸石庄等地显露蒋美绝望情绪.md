Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th — Traitor Jiang, due to repeated military defeats on the northern battlefield, is thoroughly exposing his treacherous face of being an enemy of the people. In recent days, he has used American-made bombers to invade various liberated areas in Jin-Cha-Ji, massacring peaceful residents and destroying people's property. Since Shijiazhuang was liberated on the 12th, it has been subjected to indiscriminate bombing by Jiang and US aircraft, which has not stopped to this day. Leaflets have even been distributed, clamoring to "bomb flat" the people's city of Shijiazhuang. In recent days, although the democratic government has taken timely and vigorous measures for evacuation and protection, the people of Shijiazhuang have still suffered heavy losses. The number of civilian houses destroyed has reached several thousand. The municipal government and local people's organizations are now making every effort to help the disaster victims find shelter from the cold. In addition to wreaking havoc in Shijiazhuang, Jiang and US aircraft have also continuously and indiscriminately bombed and strafed peaceful rural areas around Fuping. People here generally believe that Traitor Jiang has never hesitated to hand over the great rivers and mountains and important cities to the United States, but he vainly attempts to "bomb flat" Shijiazhuang, which is for the liberation of the people, and his treacherous face has been completely exposed. However, Jiang's move is sufficient to admit that the Jiang bandits will never return to Shijiazhuang. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that the People's Liberation Army, due to strategic relations, took extra care to protect certain cities when withdrawing from them, because it was confident that it would soon return. Because of this, the people in the liberated areas now have a clearer understanding of the inevitable failure of Jiang and the US, and their will to demand blood debts from the US-Jiang bandit gang is even more determined. Mass organizations such as the Border Region Farmers' Association Provisional Committee have telegraphed the whole country to protest and accuse Jiang and the US of this atrocity, and said: "We will fight more victories and liberate one Shijiazhuang after another to answer the Jiang Kai-shek bandit gang."

　　匪机滥炸石庄等地显露蒋美绝望情绪
    【新华社晋察冀二十九日电】蒋贼因在北战场连遭军事挫败，遂不惜彻底暴露其与人民为敌的奸贼面目。连日来以美造轰炸机侵入晋察冀解放区各地，屠杀和平居民，摧残人民财产。石庄自十二日解放后，即连遭蒋美机滥施轰炸，迄今未停，并曾散发传单，扬言要“炸平”人民城市石家庄。日来民主政府虽及时大力进行疏散与防护，石市人民仍损失甚重。仅民房被毁者已达数千幢。现市政府及当地人民团体正竭力协助灾民觅取避寒之所。蒋美机除在石家庄肆虐外，又不断向阜平一带和平农村滥肆轰炸扫射。此间人士咸认为：蒋贼从来不惜以大好河山重要都市拱手送给美国，但对为人民解放的石家庄竟妄图加以“炸平”，奸贼面目已暴露无遗。然蒋贼此举，适足默认蒋匪永无返回石庄之一日，此与解放军过去因战略关系，撤出某些城市时，因自信不久即可重返，仍加意予以爱护一事，恰成尖锐对照。唯其如此，解放区人民现已更清楚看清蒋美必败的前途，而其向美蒋匪帮索取血债之意志也愈加坚决。边区农会临时委员会等群众团体，顷已通电全国抗议与控诉蒋美此种暴行，并称：“我们将打更多的胜仗，解放一个又一个石家庄，来答复蒋介石匪帮。”
