Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd – The CCP Central Spokesperson stated: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the American imperialists have recently secretly finalized a dirty deal. The Chiang bandits have agreed to the demands of the American imperialists, mortgaging Chinese customs as collateral for loans from the United States. Since the bloody butcher Wedemeyer came to China for investigation, American imperialism has seized multiple items of Chinese national sovereignty from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. During Wedemeyer’s stay in China, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang sold the American imperialists eight military bases, one naval base, three air force bases, three base networks, and the right to invest 350 million US dollars in Guangdong and Guangxi. On September 6th, the American Young assumed the position of advisor to the Stabilization Fund Committee, and he and a group of Americans implemented supervisory power over the Chiang bandit government's finances. On October 17th, the Chiang bandit government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a note allowing the United States to station troops in China, formally handing over the right to station troops to American imperialism. With the so-called Sino-American Relief Agreement signed on October 27th, the Chiang bandit government gave the American imperialists supervisory power over relief materials and similar materials produced in China and imported from foreign countries. The so-called US-China Education Fund Agreement signed on November 10th is an agreement by which the Chiang bandit government handed over cultural and educational supervisory power to American imperialism. In addition, American imperialism has gained increasing rights in the training of the Chiang army and is attempting to organize a joint general staff, dominated by Americans like that existing in Greece, to gain command of the Chiang army. Finally, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has sold out customs sovereignty. The American loans that Chiang Kai-shek has obtained since July by selling so much national sovereignty are only 27.7 million US dollars of so-called "food relief." The only loans not yet obtained but potentially obtainable are the 67 million US dollar US cotton loan signed last September 12th, the 300 million US dollars announced by Marshall on November 11th, and the 60 million US dollars in "temporary aid" recently proposed by the US House Foreign Affairs Committee. Since the counter-offensive by the People's Liberation Army, the American reactionaries have seen that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is a "helpless cripple" in the struggle against the Chinese people, and no amount of aid can save this cripple from death. American imperialists extremely hate the Chinese people, but since the Chinese people have proven impossible to defeat, American imperialism's policy towards China is only to give the cripple "aid" that is neither fully fed nor starved, to prolong its life, prolong the Chinese civil war, and prolong the suffering of the Chinese people. However, American imperialism's aggression against China's sacred sovereignty will never be relaxed. As the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's situation becomes more dangerous, the greedy and stingy dollar imperialists put forward increasingly harsh conditions, using less money to make the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang sell more national sovereignty. Anyone among the American imperialists, whether Zhang San or Li Si, turtle or bastard, can scold the cripple Chiang Kai-shek if they please, and the Chiang bandits not only dare not utter a word but must also express acceptance. The CCP Central Spokesperson said: All patriotic Chinese compatriots, if they want to recover the sacred and inviolable national sovereignty, must implement the content of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's declaration on this year's Double Tenth Festival, accelerating the overthrow of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The day of final reckoning with the national thieves is not far away. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and American imperialism bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences caused by their criminal deals.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd – The Chiang bandit government has decided to use tariff reductions to facilitate the dumping of American goods, allowing American imperialism to freely suck the blood of the Chinese people. According to a London dispatch from the Chiang bandit Central News Agency on October 17th: The Chiang bandit government has followed the intentions of its American masters and participated in the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" concocted by the United States in Geneva. The purpose of this agreement is to adapt to the "world trade" interests of the United States, thereby breaking the tariff autonomy of various countries. According to the "analysis report" on the Geneva Agreement published by the US State Department on October 16th: The Chiang bandit government has agreed to reduce or exempt import tariffs on 110 items "most important" to the United States, including ordinary consumer goods such as tobacco and dried fruit, military supplies such as airplanes and cotton, radios, automobiles, food, fuel, and tractors, or maintain the current tax rate of 15 percent without further increase, or reduce the current tax rate by another 16 and two-thirds percent. As for which items are duty-free, this was not specifically indicated. The United States, on the other hand, only agreed to make certain tariff "concessions" on a few Chinese military raw materials such as tungsten ore and handkerchiefs.

　　中共中央发言人严斥蒋美肮脏买卖
    抵押海关换金元打内战
    维护国家主权只有加速打倒蒋介石
    【新华社陕北二日电】中共中央发言人称：蒋介石匪帮与美国帝国主义者之间，最近又秘密的谈妥了一宗肮脏的买卖，蒋匪已同意美国帝国主义的要求，把中国海关当作向美国借款的抵押。自血腥屠夫魏德迈来华考察以来，美国帝国主义已经过蒋介石匪帮攫去了中国多项国家主权。魏德迈在华期间，蒋介石匪帮卖给美国帝国主义的，有八个军事基地，一个海军基地，三个空军基地，三个基地网，和在两广投资三亿五千万美元的权利。九月六日美人杨格就任平准基金委员会顾问，他和他带来的一批美国人，就实施了对于蒋匪政府金融的监督权。十月十七日蒋匪政府外交部照会允许美国在中国驻兵，这样就把驻兵权正式送给了美国帝国主义。十月二十七日签订的所谓中美救济协定，蒋匪政府又把对于救济物资以及中国生产及由外国输入的同类物资的监督权给了美国帝国主义。十一月十日签订的所谓美国对华教育基金协定，就是蒋匪政府把文化教育监督权送给美国帝国主义的协定。此外，美国帝国主义已在蒋军的训练方面取得了日益增多的权利，并且正在企图组织像存在于希腊的以美国人为主的联合参谋部，以获得对蒋军的指挥权。最后，蒋介石匪帮又出卖了海关主权。蒋匪自七月以来出卖了如许国家主权，他所到手的美国借款，仅是二千七百七十万美元的所谓“粮食救济”。尚未到手而可能到手的只有去年九月十二日签订的美棉贷款六千七百万美元，十一月十一日马歇尔所宣布的三亿美元，以及最近美国众议院外交委员会所提出的“临时援助”六千万美元而已。自从人民解放军反攻以来，美国反动派已经看出蒋介石匪帮在反对中国人民的斗争中，是一条“扶不起的癞狗”，任何援助也不能挽救这条癞狗的死亡。美国帝国主义者极端仇恨中国人民，然而中国人民既然证明是不可能战胜的，美国帝国主义对中国的政策，就唯有给癞狗以吃不饱饿不死的“援助”，以延长其寿命，延长中国的内战，延长中国人民的痛苦。但是美国帝国主义对中国神圣主权的侵略是决不放松的，在蒋介石匪帮形势更加危险的时候，贪婪而吝啬的金元帝国主义者就提出日益苛刻的条件，用更少的钱使蒋介石匪帮出卖更多的国家主权。美国帝国主义者中随便何人，不论张三李四，乌龟王八，只要高兴就都可以把癞狗蒋介石训斥一顿，蒋匪不但不敢出一声气，而且还要表示接受。中共中央发言人说：一切爱国的中国同胞，要想收回神圣不可侵犯的国家主权，就只有实行今年双十节中国人民解放军宣言的内容，加速打倒蒋介石匪帮。最后清算窃国大盗的日子已经不远了，蒋介石匪帮与美国帝国主义进行罪恶买卖所引起的一切严重后果，由蒋介石匪帮与美国帝国主义者负完全的责任。
    【新华社陕北二日电】蒋匪政府已决定以减免关税办法，便利美货倾销，让美国帝国主义放手向中国人民吸血。据蒋匪中央社十月十七日伦敦专电称：蒋匪政府已遵照其美国主子意旨，参加由美国一手包办在日内瓦缔订之“国际关税与贸易一般协定”。该协定之目的，即在于适应美国“世界贸易”利益，借以打破各国关税自主权。据美国务院十月十六日所公布之关于日内瓦协定“分析报告”披露：蒋匪政府已答应对美国“最为重要”之一百一十项物品减免进口关税，其中包括普通消费品烟草、干果，军用物资机飞及棉花、无线电、汽车、食粮、燃料、曳引机等，或维持现行税率百分之十五不得再行增加，或按现行税率再行减低百分之十六又三分之二，至于何者免税则未具体注明。美国方面则只答应对中国军用原料如钨矿及手帕等几种物品，作某些关税“让步”。
