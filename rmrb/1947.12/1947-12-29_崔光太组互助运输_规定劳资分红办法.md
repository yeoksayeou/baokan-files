[This report from our newspaper in the Taiyue region, dated the 27th] The Cui Guangtai Mutual Aid Brigade in Baicun, Hongtong, engaged in transportation and textile production early on, and had already gained substantial profits by mid-December. At the conclusion of the Three Autumns campaign, a meeting of all brigade members was convened. Based on the brigade's personnel and this year's poor harvest, it was determined that there was a shortfall of 3,778 dan, 9 dou, and 6 sheng of grain needed to last until the next summer harvest. If this was not remedied through winter production, people would starve to death like in 1943. All members clearly recognized the importance of winter production and unanimously agreed to reorganize the mutual aid form and engage in transportation and textile production. Out of the brigade's 365 full and semi-able-bodied men and 223 livestock, 155 full and semi-able-bodied men and 152 livestock were selected to participate in long-distance transportation. The remaining 210 full and semi-able-bodied men stayed home to press oil and engage in short-distance transportation, prepared to participate in combat at any time, while the women devoted themselves to textile production.

The organizational leadership focused on solving the difficulties of poor hired laborers. When poor peasant Hao Jingui wanted to buy a donkey, the mutual aid group mobilized middle peasant Fan Jiucheng to lend him three dan of wheat. Poor peasants Jia Fengbao and Zhao Fuyuan went to Lüliang to trade livestock. Poor peasants Zhao Zhongshui and Hu Yonggui had no capital for transportation, but solutions were found for them through everyone's efforts.

The transportation team set off on October 25th in four directions: one to transport railway tracks to ××, one to transport cotton and trade livestock in Lüliang, and the other two to transport oil and salt to Yicheng and Anze, and Guxian. By December 15th, in fifty days, each route had made three round trips, and the two oil mills had pressed oil, earning a total profit of 5.7 million yuan. Women wove 1,675 chi of cloth.

To ensure uninterrupted transportation and that women's textile production did not lack raw materials and could sell finished products, the cooperative frequently contacted state-owned stores, the industrial and commercial tax bureau, and other economic departments. They transported and sold 1,230 chi of cloth.

In the profit sharing of transportation, great efforts were made to take care of poor hired laborers, adhering to the principle of "more for labor, less for capital." People were the unit of labor. A mule was equivalent to two people, a donkey to one person. One person driving one animal was considered half labor, while driving two animals was considered full labor. Labor-capital cooperation in transportation allocated profits at an 80/20 ratio, while general transfer transport not involving sales was allocated entirely based on labor. In addition, the amount of cargo carried was used as a standard, converting to equivalent value based on local market prices, and then profits were distributed based on capital. The combination of combat and transportation was allocated based on a "dead reckoning for the living" method, with one day of transportation equivalent to twelve points. Of the twenty-four livestock brought back from Lüliang, poor hired laborers purchased sixteen.
