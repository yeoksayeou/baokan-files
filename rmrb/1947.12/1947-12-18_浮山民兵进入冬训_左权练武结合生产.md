    Fushan Militia Enters Winter Training
    Zuoquan Combines Military Training with Production
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 16th Dispatch] Fushan County is engaging in large-scale winter military training for the militia, to improve the militia's combat effectiveness and support the great counter-offensive. After the land reform movement in Fushan this year, liberated peasants enthusiastically joined the militia to protect the fruits of their liberation. The county already has ×× companies. At present, under the principle of not affecting participation in the war, they are all undergoing rotational training. Except for the militia of the First and Fourth Districts who are on expeditions, the militia of the Second, Third, and Fifth Districts are all conducting training by district, organized by the District Armed Forces Committee. The Second District began on November 27th, divided into the east and west of the ridge, with the District Armed Forces Committee responsible for centralized training. The Third District began on November 23rd. The Fifth District began on November 17th. In addition, the County Armed Forces Committee concentrated 36 cadres above the platoon level, as well as medical orderlies and buglers, on November 27th for training. The training period is one month for the county and half a month for the districts. During the training, the class consciousness of the liberated militia has been greatly enhanced.
    [Our Newspaper, Zuoquan Dispatch] At present, our county is making every effort to carry out winter production. Because everyone's understanding of winter production is insufficient, some villages have brought back the old style in military training, even concentrating the militia during the day for basic exercises on the training ground, wasting manpower and money and alienating themselves from the masses. Some villages are combining it very well. For example, in Shui'ao Village, Second District of Zuoquan, the village militia leader first organized the militia for production and conducted winter training during production. The village has a total of twenty-five militiamen. They concentrated all the donkeys in the homes of the militiamen, with one person driving three donkeys. The remaining militiamen organized a coal transportation team (a total of twenty-one people) to transport coal from Wencheng to Aiyukou, transporting it once a day. In addition to eating, each person earns four sheng of millet a day. While walking on the road empty-handed, they engage in organized discussions of problems. They rest once every five to seven days to conduct military training. They all set out production and training plans, conduct small checks every half month, and summarize on March 18th.

    浮山民兵进入冬训
    左权练武结合生产
    【本报太岳十六日电】浮山全县民兵冬季大练武，提高民兵战斗力，支援大反攻。浮山今年土改运动之后，翻身农民踊跃参加民兵，保卫翻身果实，全县已有××连。目前在不影响参战的原则下，皆进行轮训，除一、四区民兵远征外，二、三、五区民兵，皆以区为单位，分别进行训练。二区于十一月二十七日开始，分岭东、岭西，由区武委会负责集训。三区于十一月二十三日开始。五区于十一月十七日开始。此外，县武委会于十一月二十七日集中排级以上干部三十六名、及卫生员、司号员等，进行训练，训练时间县为一月，区为半月。训练中，翻身民兵阶级觉悟都有很大提高。
    【本报左权讯】目前我县正全力进行冬季生产，由于大家对今冬生产认识不足，所以有部分村庄，在练武中又把老一套作风搬来运用，甚至在白天还集中民兵作操场基本动作，劳民伤财脱离群众。有些村结合的很好，如左权二区水凹村，村武主首先组织民兵生产，在生产中进行冬练。该村共有二十五个民兵，把民兵们家里所有的毛驴都集中起来，一人赶三头，下余民兵组织运煤队（共二十一人）由温城运到隘峪口，每天运一回，除吃外每人一天长小米四升。在路上空走时，有组织的谈论问题，五天至七天就休息一次，进行练武，他们每人都订出生产练武计划，半月小检查，三一八总结。  （贵成）
