[Urgent dispatch from the Jinan Front, December 28th] Yuncheng has been captured by the People's Liberation Army. On the evening of the 27th, our troops entered the city with lightning speed in half an hour. After fierce fighting until dawn on the 28th, the enemy defending the city was completely annihilated, bringing the battle to a victorious conclusion. From now on, this most important stronghold of the Chiang bandits in southern Shanxi belongs to the people.

Since the 20th, the Jinan People's Liberation Army, with absolute superiority in manpower and firepower, has completely besieged Yuncheng and Anyi, and began to sweep away the outer fortifications with the force of autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. By the 22nd, after three days of fighting, more than a dozen strong outer fortifications and more than fifty ground bunkers had been captured; the 8th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 369th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the 36th Division of the Chiang bandit army, the 2nd Platoon of the 1st Battalion of the 250th Regiment of the 84th Brigade of the 17th Division, and the entire 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion were annihilated.

On the evening of the 23rd, we attacked the "Monument Tower", one of the four major positions of the Chiang bandits in Yuncheng. The 5th Company of the 369th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the 36th Division, two units of the regimental special service team, and four squads of the 8th Company, relied on strong fortifications and firepower support, and struggled desperately all night. But our brave and tenacious people's fighters launched continuous fierce attacks, and finally completely occupied it at dawn on the 24th. Except for ten enemy soldiers who were captured alive, all the rest were blown to death, and not a single one escaped.

Another unit of our army captured the ground bunker of the Majiayao group, one of the four major positions of the Chiang bandits, on the 20th, and completely cleared the bunker complex near that position by the 24th, totaling seventeen ground bunkers and three large bunkers numbered 9, 10, and 11. At the same time, eight ground bunkers north of the city were also captured. By this time, all obstacles to scaling the city walls had been cleared.

On the evening of the 27th, after our army bombarded the city with fierce artillery fire, it quickly entered the city. After a night of fierce fighting, Yuncheng was completely liberated. A large number of enemy materials were captured, and are currently being inventoried.

Note: Yuncheng is an important strategic stronghold of the bandit Hu Zongnan in the triangular area of southern Shanxi. After being isolated by our forces, it relied on the outer bunker complex to protect the city, and the strong firepower within the city supported the outer bunker fortifications, relying on each other. However, after being dealt a devastating blow by our army in the last campaign, the Chiang bandit army was unable to hold on firmly, nor dared to do so. This time, the outer bunkers have been completely replaced by regular troops, and miscellaneous puppet troops have been pulled in to defend the city. These outer outposts are strongly defended with several outer moats and several rows of barbed wire. In particular, among the dozen or so large bunkers occupied by our army, four main bunkers were also equipped with reinforced concrete fortifications, lighting equipment, telephone water, and underground transportation; the enemy had called them: "Modernized permanent fortifications, impregnable fortresses." However, under the powerful artillery fire of our People's Liberation Army and the brave attacks of our soldiers, they were as fragile as a basket of eggs, collapsing at the slightest touch. For example, the attack on Bunker No. 16 took only ten minutes to blast it into the ground; the attack on Bunker No. 12 in Xiguan also took only ten minutes to uproot it.

Also, Yuncheng is a famous salt-producing area, and its salt is sold in Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces.

[Dispatch from the Jinan Front, December 28th] At 3:00 PM on the 26th, a Chiang bandit fighter plane dropped bombs in the western suburbs of Yuncheng. It was hit by our fire, and fled west with smoke billowing from its tail, but finally crashed in the Jiexian area of our Jinan Liberated Area.

　　晋南我军解放运城守城蒋匪全部被歼
    【本报晋南前线二十八日急电】运城已经被人民解放军打下来了。二十七日黄昏，我军用半点钟的速度就打进城里，激战到二十八日天刚亮的时候，把守城的敌人完全消灭，胜利的结束了战斗。从此，蒋匪在晋南的这个最重要的据点就成了人民的。
    从二十日起，晋南人民解放军以绝对优势兵力、火力，完全包围了运城、安邑，以秋风落叶的态势，开始扫除外围碉堡。到二十二日，经过三天战斗中，就打下外围强固碉堡十几座，伏地堡五十多个；歼灭蒋匪军三十六师一二三旅三六九团三营八连两个排，十七师八四旅二五○团一营二排及二营五连全部。
    二十三日黄昏，又攻打运城蒋匪四大阵地之一的“纪念塔”，匪军三十六师一二三旅三六九团第五连、团特务队两部及八连四个班，依靠强固工事和火力支援，拚命的挣扎了一夜，但我英勇顽强的人民战士们连续猛攻，二十四日天亮时，终于全部占领了它。守敌除被活捉十名外，其余全被炸死，没有一个漏网。
    另一部我军二十日攻占了蒋匪四大阵地之一的马家窑集团的伏地碉堡，到二十四日完全扫清那个阵地附近的碉堡群，计伏地碉十七个及九号、十号、十一号大碉三座；同时又攻占了城北八个伏地碉。至此，全部扫清了登城的障碍。
    二十七日黄昏，我军用猛烈炮火轰击后，就很快打进城里，激战一夜，把运城完全解放。歼灭敌人缴获东西都很多，正在清查。
    按：运城是胡匪宗南在晋南三角地带的重要战略据点。从被我孤立后，就依靠外围的碉堡群来保护城内，以城内的强大火力支援外围碉堡工事，互相依存。但在上次战役受我军歼灭性打击后，蒋匪军已无力固守，也不敢固守。这次外围碉堡已完全换成正规军，把杂伪拉去守城。这些外围据点工事都有几道外壕与数道铁丝网的强固设防。特别是在我军占了的十几个大碉中，有四个主碉还设有钢骨水泥工事、照明器材、电话自来水、地下交通；敌曾自称为：“现代化永久性筑城，攻不破的堡垒”。但是在我人民解放军强大炮火轰击和战士英勇猛攻之下，不过象一筐鸡蛋，一触即毁。如攻击十六号大碉，不过十几分钟就把它炸成平地；攻击西关十二号大碉也不过十几分钟，就把它连根拔掉。
    又，运城是著名的产盐地区，所产的盐行销山西、河南、陕西三省。
    【本报晋南前线二十八日电】二十六日下午三点钟，蒋匪战斗机一架在运城西郊扔炸弹，被我击中，尾巴上冒着烟急忙向西飞逃，但终于落到我晋南解放区解县境内。
