　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 6th: Prague dispatch: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia recently held a plenary session. The Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Klement Gottwald, reported on the domestic economic situation, stating: "The total industrial production in the first ten months of this year has completed and exceeded the target set by the Two-Year Plan by 4 percent, and the economic situation is quite satisfactory. The living standards of the working people have been rising steadily in the first half of the year. Although it was temporarily suspended in the second half due to the famine, the farmers received full assistance from the government, which is unprecedented in Czech history." Gottwald then reviewed the domestic political situation, stating: "The characteristic of the past few months has been the unyielding struggle against the reactionaries in all aspects of public and political life." Gottwald solemnly pointed out: "The National Front is not merely a union of various political parties. For us, the National Front is a grand alliance of workers, peasants, handicraftsmen, and intellectuals. We must first adhere to this interpretation of the National Front." Gottwald sternly criticized the reactionaries for plotting to launch rebellions and coups under foreign instructions, and warned sharply: "This is 1947, not 1920." Gottwald finally put forward the current tasks of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia: "Ensure the food supply for the people at all costs; pay special attention to Slovakia; ensure that the first year of the two-year plan exceeds the target; ensure the normal development of the economy and improve the living standards of the working people; suppress anti-government conspiracies in Slovakia; carry out resolute cleansing of anti-government and fascist elements in the social life of Slovakia." In terms of diplomacy, Gottwald pointed out: It is necessary to wage a merciless struggle against all tendencies that attempt to weaken the alliance between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union and other Slavic countries; and ensure that this alliance becomes increasingly consolidated. Gottwald declared in his concluding remarks: "Our party has a complete possibility of winning the majority of the people, and our party will definitely win this majority." The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Rudolf Slánský, announced at the plenary session: As of November 28, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has 1,281,138 members, including 419,000 female members. A total of 237,384 new members were recruited this year.
