　　Lin Cheng County Government Directs All Districts and Villages
  　to Establish Winter Schools for Emancipated Peasants
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 6th] The Lin Cheng County Government has recently instructed all teachers to rapidly develop the winter school movement. It pointed out that each school district and village should, according to its specific situation and in conjunction with the current work in the village, immediately start winter schools. This year's winter schools must be clearly defined as winter schools for emancipated peasants, and should still focus on political education, organizing peasants for cultural learning while inspiring their willingness. The curriculum, lamp oil, classrooms, and especially the issue of teachers in the winter schools should be properly resolved as early as possible. Promote last year's winter school practice of "whoever is good at that aspect should serve as the teacher for that aspect." In addition, under this year's spirit of thrift and famine relief, the funds for each school must be resolved through production and must not increase the burden on the masses. Secondly, the leadership must be based on poor peasants and hired laborers to grasp the leadership of the winter schools, truly achieving peasants running winter schools and peasants attending winter schools.
    [This newspaper, Pingding] The Pingding Education Section convened a meeting of all county high schools and joint principals on November 25th to discuss and study how to go back and help village cadres provide free education to run winter schools well. The following points were studied: (1) In terms of leadership, responsible cadres from various departments in the village should be absorbed to participate in jointly organizing the winter school committee. (2) In specific practices, more reflection and discussion methods should be used to examine the specific achievements in disaster preparedness and savings, as well as winter production. The content should be combined with production and current affairs; political and current affairs should be the main focus in the new areas; and cultural and political should be equally emphasized in the old areas. (3) The teaching materials should focus on collecting practical materials from the masses to educate the masses. (Huangfu Yuzhen)

　　临城县府指示各区村
  　为翻身农民办冬学
    【本报太行六日电】临城县政府，顷指示各教员，迅速开展冬学运动。指出各学区、各村应按照具体情况，结合村中当前工作，马上开办冬学。今年的冬学，在性质上必须明确是翻身农民的冬学，仍以政治教育为主，在启发农民自愿的情况下，组织农民的文化学习。冬学中的课程、灯油、校室、特别是师资问题，应早些恰当解决。发扬去年冬学“谁长于那方面的、就担任那方面的教员的做法。”另外，各校的经费，在今年节约渡荒的精神下，一定要从生产上来解决，绝不能加重群众负担。其次领导上也必须是以贫雇为骨干，来掌握冬学的领导权，真正达到农民办冬校、农民上冬学。
    【本报平定讯】平定教育科，在十一月二十五号召集全县各高校及联合校长会议，讨论研究如何回去帮助村干义教搞好冬学，研究出了以下几点：（一）在领导上，要吸收村里各部门负责干部参加，共同组织冬学委员会。（二）具体做法，要多用反省讨论方法，来检查备灾节约中的具体成绩及冬季生产等，内容要结合生产、时事政治，要在生产单位中进行；在新区政治、时事为主；老区以文化政治并重。（三）教材，着重搜集群众中的实际材料，来教育群众。（皇甫玉珍）
