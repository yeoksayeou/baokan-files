    In various villages of the Fifth District, the burden assessment was checked. In Nan Zhang Village, poor and hired laborers were mobilized to re-measure the land themselves, revealing 34 mu of vacant land belonging to those who had been liberated (but were not paying grain or bearing burdens). They also found 27 mu of hidden land from the landlords. The peasants were very excited. The poor and hired laborers of Nan Song Village held a large meeting to discuss who was suffering losses in today's burden assessment. After deliberation, Guo Caisun (a middle peasant) said: "In the past, Lu Xinfa was a poor peasant and wore a 'suffering loss' hat. Although he is a liberated peasant now, he still has many difficulties. He wants to build a stove, but he doesn't have the bricks, fire opening, fire pillar, or coal shovel. Even if he harvests several shi of grain, it's not enough to buy furniture. Not to mention bearing burdens, it's already tough enough for him even without it. Let's compare it to me. Last year, I paid 240 jin of rice, and this year I will pay 171 jin of rice. I am doing better than Xinfa, and I am paying 69 jin less than last year. Middle and poor peasants are one family. If the poor peasants can't turn over, the middle peasants can't protect their roots. I will voluntarily pay 40 jin more." His speech was well-received by everyone. Comrade Yu Chun, the branch secretary, praised this spirit of unity. After discussion and self-reporting, 415 points were fairly and reasonably allocated to take care of the liberated peasants. The landlords were also assigned an additional 186 points. (Yinzhu, Rencai, Shuiwang, Nan Song Correspondence Group)

    南宋重新评议负担
    中农自动照顾贫雇
    【本报长治讯】五区各村检查负担，南掌发动贫雇亲自重新丈地，查出翻身户空地三十四亩（没打粮出负担），从地主手里查出隐藏地二十七亩，农民很兴奋。南宋贫雇主持开大会，讨论今天负担谁吃亏？经酝酿郭财顺（中农）说：“过去路新发是贫农，戴着吃亏帽子哩，他虽是翻身户，困难很多：想垒火，砖、火口、火柱、煤铣都没有，打了几石粮食不够治家具，不用说负担，就是不出负担也够受。就比我说吧，去年出了二百四十斤米，今年出了一百七十一斤米，我不行不行比新发还强，比去年又少出了六十九斤，中贫农是一家，贫农翻不了身，中农护不住根，我自动多出四十斤。”他的发言受到了大家的欢迎，支书玉春同志提出表扬这种团结的精神。经过讨论与自报，公平合理的照顾了翻身户四百一十五分。地主又加了一百八十六分。 （银珠、仁才、水旺、南宋通讯组）
