　　[Licheng News] On the 14th of this month, Licheng deployed winter military training at a meeting of district armed cadres. It pointed out several key points: 1. Self-study for military training is a concrete task to directly support the counter-offensive. In the future, militia and self-defense forces will frequently participate in expeditions and combat. Therefore, winter military training and self-study must be carried out to improve the combat effectiveness of the people's armed forces. 2. Self-study for military training must adapt to the needs of the war. In the context of organizing large numbers of militia and self-defense forces to participate in expeditions and support border areas, military training and self-study should enable them to better serve the war effort. 3. Self-study for military training must be based on winter production, with winter production as the main focus, closely integrated with military training and self-study. To lead military training and self-study, it is necessary to first mobilize the militia to actively participate in production and solve the problems and difficulties of the militia in winter production.
    Regarding the content and requirements of military training and self-study:
    1. Young and middle-aged militia and self-defense forces should learn the three major skills of shooting, blasting, and grenade throwing. Carry out air defense drills, raising colorful flags education, etc. 2. Young and middle-aged militia should generally learn shooting aiming. 3. Grenade throwing, blasting, and camouflage. In organizing and leading, start from the immediate interests of the peasants, learn skills to uproot the old roots, and combine reviewing participation in the war and summarizing the experience of participating in the war. Take hired and poor peasants as the backbone, combined with various production organizations. (Licheng County Military Association, Xisheng)
    [Neiqiu News] The militia of Wujiazhuang in the Fifth District discussed military training. Comrade Wu Chenggun said, "In the past, our basic masses only saw the landlords holding guns, and we didn't have the right to hold guns. Now, the Communist Party has led us to turn over and given us peasants weapons to defend our fruits. Most of us are new militia members, and we can only make the guns fire, but we can't shoot accurately. We must train hard." Some said, "Let's see how many people can use guns." After inspection, only seven out of twenty-four militia members could use guns simply. At this time, everyone said, "How can we be militiamen if we can't use guns? We have to work hard to practice!" In the heated discussion, the future tasks were clarified: to spare time for military training and cultural studies during winter production. It was proposed: "Good militiamen should step up hard training, strive to learn culture, and strive to be models of both military and cultural excellence." At the same time, the leaders of the military training and literacy groups were elected. Now they have begun to voluntarily train in military skills. (Wujiazhuang Correspondent Group, Shutian)

　　黎城布置练武自学
  　武家庄民兵自动练武学文化
    【本报黎城讯】黎城于本月十四日，在区武装干部会上布置冬季练武。指出几点：一、练武自学是直接支援反攻的具体工作，今后民兵自卫队远征参战，将成为经常的任务，因此必须进行冬季练武自学，提高人民武装的战斗力。二、练武自学要适应战争的需要，在组织大批民兵、自卫队远征参战支援边地情况下，经过练武自学使能更好服务于参战。三、练武自学必须在冬季生产基础上，以冬季生产为主，紧密结合练武自学。领导练武自学，必须首先发动民兵积极参加生产，并解决民兵在冬季生产中的问题与困难。
    关于练武自学的内容与要求上：
    一、青壮年民兵自卫队学会射击爆炸投弹三大本领。演习防空抬彩号教育等。二、青壮年民兵普遍学射击瞄准。三、投弹爆炸做伪装。在组织领导上从农民切身利益谈起，学好本领刨倒老根，结合检讨参战总结参战经验。以雇贫为骨干，结合各种生产组织。　　　　　　　（黎城县武会、喜生）
    【本报内邱讯】五区武家庄民兵，讨论练武，武成群同志说：“过去咱们基本群众只见过人家老财拿枪，没有咱拿枪的权利，现在共产党领导咱们翻了身，给了咱农民武器保卫果实，咱们大部是新民兵，使枪只能打响，打不准，咱一定要练武。”有的说，到底看看有几个会使枪？经检查有二十四名民兵中，只有七人会简单使枪，这时大家说，“当个民兵枪也不会使，可得加油苦练呀。”在大家热烈讨论中，明确今后任务，是在冬季生产中抽空练武学习文化。提出：“好民兵加紧苦练，努力学习文化，争取文武模范。”同时选举了练武、识字组长。现在已开始自动练武。　　　　　　（武家庄通讯组、书田）
