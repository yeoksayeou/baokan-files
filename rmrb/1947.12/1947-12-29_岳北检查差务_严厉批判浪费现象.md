Yuebei Inspects Labor Service
	Severely Criticizes Wasteful Phenomena
[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 27th] The Yuebei Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of labor service cadres from ten counties across the region on the 11th of this month. Everyone exchanged experiences and innovations from past labor service work, such as combining labor conscription and freighting with agricultural transportation to save civilian labor. Subsequently, there was a stern criticism of the erroneous thinking of "handling public affairs publicly" that existed in past labor service work, and the failure to care about the suffering of the masses and find ways to economize, which caused serious waste of civilian labor. In the 24 examples reported by the nine counties, situations such as unnecessary and indiscriminate demands for laborers, poor planning, unclear assembly points, short weighing of grain at warehouses, or failure to consider the masses' time, and irresponsible leading cadres, resulted in the waste of 22,736 units of labor and 2,505 livestock. In particular, over 10,000 *shi* of public grain from Pingyao and Jiexiu this year required over 10,000 laborers to transfer due to enemy harassment. Without careful consideration, the grain was concentrated, and when the enemy advanced further, another 10,000 laborers were used to disperse the grain. In November, Qinyuan County requested 120 laborers from the first district to carry electric poles to the Dalin area, but on the phone they said they were going to cut electric poles. After the laborers went, they did not carry the poles and returned, so another 120 people were sent. Two family members of the Fourth Column needed three donkeys from Fushan to Anze and Chuan to transport cotton, salt and other things for production. The Fourth Column's garrison office requested 70 large carts from Changzi, but the people in charge didn't arrive until five days after the agreed date, and the carts and laborers waited in vain for five days. Examples like these exist in every county, and the waste in sporadic labor conscription is impossible to quantify. This made everyone deeply realize that we are not fully contributing our strength to support the front, and conversely, the masses contribute their strength but we irresponsibly waste it. The summary pointed out that in the future, in labor service, we must first use our brains to think more and consider the people in every way. Second, we must firmly grasp the leadership of districts and villages. Phenomena of not cherishing the people's interests must be exposed, criticized and punished, and good deeds must be commended. We must also find ways to popularize and simplify the administrative office's draft of mobilizing civilian labor, so that the masses understand it, and it must never be controlled by some bad elements who can write and calculate because the methods are complex and the poor cannot calculate the hire. Labor service work should be seen as a genuine service to the poor, because the vast majority of those who provide labor are hired laborers.

　　岳北检查差务
  　严厉批判浪费现象
    【本报太岳二十七日电】岳北专署于本月十一日，召开全区十县差务干事会议，大家交流了过去差务工作上并差、捎差与运输农业结合等节省民力的办法和创造。继而严厉的批评了过去在差务工作上存在着“公事公办”的错误思想，和不关心群众疾苦不想办法节约，造成了严重的浪费民力现象，在大家汇报九县所举的廿四个例子中，由于不该要、乱要民工，计划不周到、集结地点弄不清、仓库收粮称少或不照顾群众时间、带领民工干部不负责任等情形，就浪费民力达二万二千七百卅六个，牲口二千五百零五个，特别是今年平（遥）介（休）一万余石公粮，因敌人骚扰用一万余民工转移，而一时未加考虑，便集中放起，后来敌人再向前活动，又用一万余民工将粮食分散，十一月沁源县向一区要一百二十个民工到大林区扛电杆，而在电话上却说要去砍电杆，民工去后不扛就回来了，结果又派一百二十人去。四纵队两个家属从浮山到安泽和川，两个人要三头毛驴，驮着棉花盐等东西搞生产。四纵队留守处向长子要七十辆大车，结果到约定日期的第五天后带的人才来，车与民工白白等了五天。诸如此类的例子，各县都有，至于在零星用差上的浪费现象则无法统计，使大家深刻的认识到我们不能充分拿出力量来支援前线，相反的群众拿出力量我们却不负责任的浪费了。最后总结中指出，今后在差务上必须首先要用脑子多考虑，处处为民着想；其次要抓紧对区村的领导，对不爱惜民利的现象，要揭发批评处罚，好的要表扬，并要想办法将行署动员民力草案通俗化、简易化，使群众了解，决不能因办法复杂、雇贫计算不了而被某些会写会算的坏分子掌握。应将差务工作看作是真正为雇贫服务的一项，因为支差者绝大部分都是雇贫。
