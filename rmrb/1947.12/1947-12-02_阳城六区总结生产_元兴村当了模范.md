Yangcheng Sixth District Sums Up Production
　　Yuanxing Village Becomes a Model
[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 30th] The Sixth District of Yangcheng summed up its year's production on the 17th of this month. Over the past year, the entire district has organized mutual aid production, overcome natural disasters, and implemented drought prevention and preparedness through intensive farming. First, three or five water channels were repaired, seventeen wells were dug, thirty-eight ponds were created, twenty-five water storage pits were constructed, and two hundred and forty-seven latrines were built. Second, intensive farming was carried out, with sixty loads of manure applied per mu, and plowing three times, achieving 60% of a normal year's harvest and 80% of a good harvest. Furthermore, all 6159.9 mu of autumn land has been completely turned over. Over the past year, 118 models have emerged from the production activities of the entire district's masses, of which 38 are women, 110 are hired laborers and poor peasants, and 8 are middle peasants. Each model was selected as a typical example in a joint village assessment to participate in the district-wide merit recognition conference. The conference concluded that Yuanxing Village, led by hired laborers and poor peasants, organized intensive farming, resulting in an average per capita income of 5.78 dan of grain from agriculture and sideline occupations this year, and was named a model village for the entire district. The Lujia River sub-team of the Yanshang Shangguan Mutual Aid Brigade, under the leadership of poor laborers Lu Sihe and Lu Sishun, and the woman Bai Rusai, organized 100% of the able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women, closely integrating participation in the war effort with agriculture and sideline occupations, and was named a model mutual aid team for the entire district. The five mutual aid teams of Li Qiyou in Shuitou Village, Yuan Shengyuan in Duiqiao Village, Zhao Fengqin (female) in Shundi Village, and Wang Youdan in Xuequanling were named model mutual aid teams in the joint defense villages. After the selection, a congratulatory conference was held on the 21st. District Chief Li called for continuing to implement organization, establishing a core of hired laborers and poor peasants, and learning from Yuanxing Village and Lujia River in this winter's production.
