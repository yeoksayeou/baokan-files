　　The Mass Line in Agricultural Technology Leadership
    ——A Review of Agricultural and Forestry Work in the Taihang Third Special District for One Year

    On November 15th, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Taihang Third Special District convened a meeting of major labor heroes and technical experts from all counties in the special district to summarize and exchange experiences and lessons learned in agricultural technology work over the past year. On several key issues, it clarified the direction and methods for future agricultural technology guidance.

    I. The Path That Village Technical Committees Should Take

    First, village technical committees must establish a clear class perspective, breaking away from the purely technical viewpoint that existed in the past. Previously, most village technical committees only focused on absorbing people with technical skills, without paying attention to establishing a backbone of poor and hired peasants. Rich peasants and landlords took the opportunity to infiltrate, rendering many technical committees unable to truly serve the masses and becoming merely a formality. Since the land reform, the masses have realized from their own experiences that the old technical committees were ineffective. Therefore, in many villages, the masses spontaneously reorganized the technical committees, removing landlords and rich peasants, leading to significant achievements. For example, the technical committee of Huojiayao Village in Licheng County was controlled by landlords and rich peasants before its reorganization. In their work, they talked a lot but did little, hiding their skills and even engaging in sabotage. They did not exchange farming techniques when tilling the land, and they were not responsible for regulating seeds during sowing, even saying: "The poor and hired peasants are speculating. Grain is so expensive, who would be willing to lend it?" After being reorganized by the masses, their work took on a new look. During the spring plowing, they solved the problem of tool shortages for the poor and hired peasants, organized six-sided harrows, and when resisting drought and sowing seeds, they meticulously studied techniques to ensure the emergence of seedlings. During weeding, they organized the masses to kill insects with local methods (Yangtao root, bitter locust root, etc.). During the summer harvest, they organized women and children to remove 40 mu of wheat with black mold disease. The entire village increased production by 830 shi throughout the year.

    Secondly, in terms of work direction and methods, village technical committees must implement the mass viewpoint of "from the masses, to the masses," becoming organizations that organize and lead mass technology. In the past, many places remained at the stage of purely individual and technical committee research, without organizing and leading mass technology. The technology they researched was handed over to the masses without their approval. When encountering difficulties and facing problems, they did not discuss with the masses but asked the superiors for solutions, resulting in a lot of effort and little achievement. For example, the technical committee of Huangniuti Village in Lucheng County always wanted to come up with a special method on its own, instead of focusing on improving mass technology. When they could not come up with a new method during the spring plowing, they thought they were not good enough. When the masses offered suggestions, they complained that the superiors did not come. Over the past year, many places have realized from practical work that technical experts and technical committees must not only have technology themselves, but also be good at organizing mass technology. After clarifying this point, the method is not simply to do it themselves, but to face the masses, discover mass creation, organize mass experience, and disseminate mass technology. The technology they have researched should also be approved by the masses first. When they have no solutions themselves, they should not face the superiors but discuss with the masses. Yanggao Village in Pingshun County and Beiliu Village in Licheng County have thus brought into play the creativity of the masses and overcome natural disasters and insect pests.

    II. The Mass Line in Experimentation and Promotion Work

    Although experimentation and promotion work has achieved many results in the past year, a strict review reveals that there is still a very serious "failure to proceed from reality and failure to proceed from the masses," a subjective, non-mass line style in the work route.

    In promotion work, there is subjectivism and a purely task-oriented viewpoint, disregarding local climate, fertilizer, soil quality, yield, and other production conditions, not considering the interests of the masses, and not addressing the thinking of the masses. When promoting improved varieties, they blindly distributed promotional figures, resulting in a task-oriented viewpoint among some village cadres and activists, regardless of whether the local area could grow or harvest, stubbornly claiming "whatever the superiors call for, we will promote," "we must grow it even if we can grow it, and we must grow it even if we cannot grow it," "growing it is progress, not growing it is backward." This made it so that even in areas where it could be promoted, the masses did not accept it happily, and in areas where it could not be grown, the masses suffered losses. For example, Shipo Village in Huguan County was not suitable for growing Golden Queen corn due to the cold weather, but they forced the masses to grow it. Last year, the masses suffered losses after planting 600 mu, and this year they planted another 300 mu, but still did not achieve a good harvest. In some individual areas, they even designated seed retention areas, prohibiting the planting of local crops, forcing the pulling up of green seedlings, and not considering the specific difficulties of the masses.

    The masses, on the other hand, based their decisions on local production conditions and requirements, planting whatever could be grown and planting whatever could bring prosperity. For example, Songhou Village in Licheng County, the superiors called for the promotion of the three major crops, but the villagers only planted Golden Queen corn and not 169 corn based on local conditions. They also planted a large amount of turnip and codonopsis on the mountain slopes, resulting in very good results.

    In seed selection, there is also a narrow viewpoint, recognizing only the three major crops as the only improved varieties. Seed selection only focuses on the three major crops, neglecting the discovery and improvement of local improved varieties. They consider something to be good if they themselves think it is good, without the approval of the local masses. Many district and village cadres blindly believe that what the superiors say is good is good, not knowing that what is good in area A may have shortcomings in area B, resulting in no solutions or anything to promote in areas where it cannot be promoted, greatly limiting the work and neglecting the universal increase in production among the broad masses.

    The masses, however, have their own methods. For example, the masses in Pingshun County select various crops and bring them back for exhibition. The masses publicly recognize which is good, and that is the good seed. After approval, seed selection is carried out, resulting in the selection of not only the three major crops, but also sixty or seventy kinds of good local crops.

    In experimental work, they like to make empty and long-term plans, not proceeding from reality to serve the practical interests of the masses. They have not realized that only by solving the masses' desire for prosperity can long-term interests be realized. Therefore, in the past year, regardless of how the experiments are conducted, they have not made any achievements in drought resistance, first and foremost, as far as the masses are concerned. Some experiments are for novelty and disregard the needs of the masses, trying to grow many foreign goods, such as Taiwanese melons and foreign chickens, instead of focusing all their efforts on experimenting with mass crops.

    III. The Combination of Technical Work and Central Work

    First of all, technical work must be combined with the central work of the local area. We must understand that the central work is the most common, most urgent, and most realistic demand of the broad masses. Only by meeting this urgent demand can technical work be implemented. The two are two sides of the same coin and cannot be separated. Technical cadres hold a purely technical viewpoint and do not care about the central work, resulting in a naked dance. Some people call these people "Golden Queen, 169 cadres." Conversely, neglecting technical work cannot fully meet the needs of the masses either. Due to the deviation in the understanding of this issue, the technical work and the local administrative work are not well combined, often there is a lack of mutual understanding, inconsistent work arrangements, inconsistent steps, and inconsistent forces, each with its own set of methods, resulting in little achievement. In the future, we should conscientiously implement the scientific leadership method of unified leadership, division of labor, and responsibility.

　　农业技术领导中的群众路线
    ——太行三专区一年农林工作检讨
    十一月十五日，太行三专农林局召开了全专区各县主要劳动英雄技术能手会议，总结交流一年农业技术工作的经验教训。在几个主要问题上，为今后农业技术指导明确了方向与作法。
    一、村技委会应走的道路
    村技委会首先必须树立明确的阶级观点，打破过去存在的单纯技术观点。过去一般村技委会只注意吸收有技术的人参加，没有注意树立贫雇骨干，富农地主乘机混入，使不少技委会不能真正为群众服务，而流于形式。土改以来，群众从切身的体验中认识了旧技委会的不起作用，因此不少村子群众自发的起来改组了技委会，清除了地主富农，使工作取得显著成绩。如黎城霍家窑技委会未改组前为地主富农所掌握，他们在工作上光说不做，有技术不露，甚至还进行破坏。在垡地时不交流耕作技术，下种时不负责调剂种子，反说：“贫雇群众投机，粮食这么贵，谁肯借。”后经群众改造，工作焕然一新。春耕时解决贫雇工具困难，组织打耙六面，抗旱下种时，又精研技术保证小苗出土，锄苗时又以土办法（杨桃根，苦槐树根等）组织群众杀虫。夏收时组织妇女、儿童拔掉四十亩小麦黑霉病，全村全年增产八三○石。
    其次村技委会在工作方向与作法上，必须贯彻从群众中来到群众中去的群众观点，成为组织与领导群众技术的组织。过去不少地方停留在单纯个人与技委会自己去研究，不去组织与领导群众技术，而自己研究出的技术又不经群众批准便硬交给群众执行，遇到困难行不通时不和群众商量，而向上级要办法，结果吃力不小成绩不大。如潞城黄牛蹄技委会，老想自己想出一种特殊办法，而不去集中提高群众技术，春耕时自己想不出新办法，便认为自己不行，群众提出意见则又埋怨上级不来。这一年来，不少地方从实际工作中已经认识到，技术能手和技委会不仅自己要有技术，更要善于组织群众技术，明确了这一点后，在作法上就不是单纯自己干，而是面向群众发现群众创造，组织群众经验，传播群众技术。自己研究出的技术也要先经群众批准，自己没办法时，不是面向上级而是和群众商量。平顺杨高村和黎城北流村便是这样发挥了群众的创造性，战胜了天灾虫害。
    二、试验与推广工作中的群众路线
    一年来试验与推广工作，虽已取得不少成绩，但严格检查起来，工作路线上还存在着极严重的“不从实际出发与不从群众出发”的主观主义非群众路线的作风。
    在推广工作上，存在着主观主义与单纯任务观点，不照顾当地气候、肥料、土质、产量等生产条件，不考虑群众利益，不打通群众思想。推广优良品种时，只是盲目的分派推广数目字，因而造成某些村干部积极分子的任务观点，不顾当地能不能种，能不能收，一口咬定“上级号召啥，咱就推广啥”，“能种也得种，不能种也得种”，有些地区甚至规定“种的可以立功，不种的不能立功，种的就是进步，不种就是落后”。使得能推广的地区，群众也不愉快接受，不能种的地区更使群众受损失。如壶关石坡村天冷不宜种金皇后，硬让群众种，去年种了六百亩群众受了伤，今年又种三百亩还是没丰收。甚至有个别地区还划定留种区，不准种土庄稼，强迫拔掉青苗地，不照顾群众具体困难。
    群众在这方面却是根据当地生产条件与要求，能种啥种啥，啥能发家种啥。如黎城松后村，上面号召推广三大作物，本村群众根据当地条件只种金皇后不种一六九，山地并大量种蔓菁党参，结果成绩很好。
    在选种上，还存在着狭隘观点，只认识三大作物是唯一的优良品种，选种时也只选三大作物，忽视了土优良品种的发现与提高。自己认为优良就是优良，也不经当地群众批准。不少区村干部便盲目的认为上边说优良就是优良，不知道在甲地好的在乙地就许会有缺点，结果在不能推广的地区就无办法可想，无啥可推广，使工作大受限制，忽视了广大群众的普遍增产。
    群众却自有办法，如平顺群众把各种作物选回展览，群众公认那种好，那种就是好种，批准后再进行选种，结果不仅是三大作物，土作物也选出六七十种好种。
    在试验工作上，喜欢作空洞长远的计划，不是从实际出发为群众现实利益服务。没有认识到只有解决了群众发家要求，才能有长远利益的实现，所以一年来，不管试验如何，对群众说，首先在抗旱中就没有作出成绩。有些试验是图新鲜而不顾群众要求，试种了不少洋货，如台湾瓜、外国鸡等，而没有把全力放在试验群众性的作物上。
    三、技术工作与中心工作的结合
    首先技术工作必须与地方中心工作结合，必须了解中心工作是广大群众最普遍最迫切最现实的要求，只有合乎这个迫切的要求，技术工作才能贯彻，二者能够结合的好才能真正满足群众要求。这是一个问题的两面，不能分开，技术干部抱单纯的技术观点，不管中心工作，结果形成裸体跳舞，有些群众就把这些人叫“金皇后、一六九干部”，反之，忽视技术工作，也不能完全满足群众的要求。由于对这问题的看法上有偏差，技术工作与地方行政工作也结合得不够，常是互相不了解，工作布置不统一，步骤不一致，力量不统一，各有一套，因之成绩不大，今后应认真做到统一领导分工负责的科学领导方法。
