Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. To break the economic difficulties imposed on students by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the Kunming Student Union launched a city-wide winter student aid campaign on October 27th. Many schools temporarily suspended classes. Under the slogan of "Solving Our Own Problems with Our Own Strength," students worked tirelessly from dawn to late at night, with an atmosphere of sympathy, mutual assistance, and unity prevailing everywhere.

　　At a student aid evening party in a certain middle school, when a student talked about not being able to pay for meals and going hungry, subsisting on two sesame cakes a day, the entire audience of more than 500 teachers and students was moved to tears, some even weeping in each other’s arms, and immediately donated cash, beloved fountain pens, watches, harmonicas, etc. Some even donated their bedding. A poor teacher stood before everyone and took off his only cotton coat for auction. The students bought the coat with tears in their eyes and then returned it to the teacher; but he still donated it again. The evening party lasted until 2 a.m., with dew wetting everyone’s hair. That night alone, nearly 100 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency was raised for student aid.

　　In addition to donating their own money, the students also went to the streets to sell newspapers, wash clothes, and polish shoes to earn money. Female students made handkerchiefs, gloves, children’s toys, etc., for charity sales. The students used all kinds of folk forms, such as the flower lantern dance, dragon lantern dance, and land boat dance, to deeply promote student aid. Even late at night, the sounds of gongs and drums and singing could be heard.

　　The inhuman Chiang Kai-shek bandits used every conspiracy to sabotage the students' self-rescue and student aid movement. They arrested Li Renson and his wife, Chiang's civil servants who supported the student aid movement, and Wang Ping, manager of the Xinmin Bookstore, and closed down the Xinmin, Overseas Chinese, and Jinma bookstores. They officially issued a document to Yunnan University, ordering students working in the Kunming Student Union and the Yunnan University Student Self-Government Association to "surrender" to the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Garrison Headquarters before October 31. Lu Han, Chairman of the Chiang Kai-shek Yunnan Provincial Government, insulted the students, saying, "It is not good to ask for donations from everyone you meet." The "Minyi Daily" of the Chiang Party Provincial Party Headquarters shamelessly fabricated a "Letter to All Sectors from the Yunnan University Student Self-Government Association," falsely claiming that "the students have accepted Lu Han's advice and canceled the student aid movement." The student aid slogans and wall newspapers on the streets were torn down, and the Chiang police went door to door to inform the citizens that they were not allowed to donate to the students, or they would be punished.

　　But the students were not intimidated by the threats of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. On November 2nd, more than 30,000 students from universities and middle schools in Kunming gathered at the Yunnan University playground and then divided into teams to expand publicity throughout the city. Students were posting wall newspapers and slogans, watching flower lanterns, or giving speeches on every street and intersection. When the student charity sales teams appeared everywhere on the morning of the 3rd, the citizens welcomed them with firecrackers and enthusiastically donated money. Workers, rickshaw pullers, porters, and old women washing clothes squeezed into the crowd to donate money. The students were unwilling to accept their hard-earned money. But they insisted, "Take it, this is what we earned with our strength. We have suffered enough from being illiterate all our lives."

　　In more than ten days of hard work, relying on their own labor and the enthusiastic sympathy of people from all walks of life, the students broke through the heavy persecution imposed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and partially solved their own living difficulties. From this, they more deeply experienced the truth that unity is strength and that they can only survive through unity and struggle.

　　昆明学生助学运动深得市民同情捐输
  　蒋匪当局阻挠破坏无效
    【新华社陕北十九日电】为了打破蒋匪所加于学生们的经济困难，十月二十七日起，昆明学联发动了一次全市性的冬季助学运动。许多学校都临时停课。学生们在“用自己力量解决自己问题”的口号下，废寝忘食，从天亮忙到深夜，到处充满了同情互助团结的空气。
    在某中学的助学晚会上，一个同学讲到缴不起膳费饿肚子，每天吃两个烧饼度日时，全场五百多师生感动得流泪，有的还抱头痛哭，立即捐出现款及心爱的自来水笔、手表、口琴等，甚至有的把铺盖也捐出来。一位穷教师站到大家面前，把自己仅有的一件棉大衣脱下来义卖，同学们流着泪的买了大衣，又重新送还给这位教师；但他却仍旧捐了出来。晚会开到深夜二时，露水淋湿了每个人的头发。这天晚上就募集了助学金接近蒋币一亿元。
    除了自己捐款以外，同学们还上街头卖报纸、洗衣服、擦皮鞋做各种工作赚钱。女同学做手帕、手套、儿童玩具等来义卖。学生们利用一切民间形式和跳花灯，耍龙灯、跑旱船等深入宣传助学，到深夜还可以听到锣鼓声和歌声。
    毫无人性的蒋匪，用尽一切阴谋破坏学生的自救助学运动。拘捕赞成助学运动的蒋记公务员李仁荪夫妇、新民书店经理王平，封闭了新民、华侨、金马等书店。正式具文给云南大学，要昆明学联及云大学生自治会工作的同学，于十月三十一日前到蒋匪警备司令部“自首”。蒋匪云南省主席卢汉侮辱学生说：“见人就募捐不是好人。”蒋党省党部的“民意日报”，更无耻的伪造“云大学生自治会告各界书”，胡说“学生们已接受了卢汉的劝告，取消助学运动”。街上的助学标语、壁报都被撕毁，蒋警挨户通告市民不准捐助学生，否则要处罚。
    但学生们并没有被蒋匪的恫吓所吓倒。十一月二日，全昆明市大中学三万余人，在云大操场集合后，分队到全市扩大宣传，每条街道和十字路口都有学生在贴壁报标语、观花灯或者演讲。三日早晨学生义卖队在各处出现时，市民们放鞭炮欢迎，热烈捐输，工人、洋车夫、挑夫、洗衣服的老婆婆都挤到人群中捐钱，学生们不肯接受他们的血汗钱。但他们坚持着说：“拿去吧，这是我们凭力气赚来的，我们这一辈子受够不识字的苦了。”
    学生们在十多天的辛劳中，依靠了自己的劳力与社会人士的热烈同情，冲破了蒋匪所加予的重重迫害，部分解决了自己的生活困难。从此他们更深刻体验出团结就是力量，团结奋斗才能生存的真理。
