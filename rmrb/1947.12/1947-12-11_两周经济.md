I. Market Conditions and Prices:
In the past half-month, prices in various regions of our district first rose and then leveled off, with salt, cloth, and imported paper showing the largest increases, and white hemp also showing an upward trend. Regionally: Grain prices in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region rose sharply. After the 10th, prices of various goods in various regions turned stable or declined. Details are as follows:

    Grain: In the first ten days of the month, autumn grain collection was underway in various regions, and the amount of grain entering the market was small, so prices generally rose, especially in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, which was more affected by the high grain prices south of the Yellow River, and the upward trend was more pronounced. In Puyang and Qingfeng, the price of wheat rose by more than 30% in the past half-month. In Ji'nan: In Linqing, before the 9th, millet once reached 156 yuan per jin, wheat 150 yuan, and red sorghum 90 yuan. After that, it trended downward. On the 17th, millet was 134 yuan per jin, wheat 144 yuan, and red sorghum 70 yuan, which were the same as in mid-October. In Nangong, the price of wheat was 160 yuan per jin, while rice fell from 160 yuan to 150-140 yuan, a drop of about 6% compared with the second half of October, while wheat rose about 2%, and miscellaneous grains remained flat. In Handan City, from the 1st to the 15th, millet fell from 145 yuan to 135 yuan per jin, wheat rose from 145 yuan to 150-160 yuan, miscellaneous grains remained flat, corn was around 80 yuan, red sorghum was around 76 yuan, and beans were around 95 yuan. Compared with the second half of October, rice was flat, wheat rose about 3%, and miscellaneous grains fell 4-5%. In Taihang: In Gaoyi, after the 6th, rice trended downward, wheat remained high, and miscellaneous grains remained flat. Millet fell from 160 yuan to 150 yuan per jin, wheat was 170-183 yuan, red sorghum was around 100 yuan, and prices were about the same as at the end of October. In Xingtai, grain prices were generally high, with millet at 167 yuan, wheat at 183 yuan, and corn at 105 yuan on the 15th. In Yangyi, from the 1st to the 15th, millet fell from 170-150 yuan to 132-140 yuan, wheat fell from 173 yuan to 160 yuan, corn was flat at 90 yuan, and black beans fell from 140 yuan to 120 yuan. Compared with the second half of October: rice was flat, wheat rose 11%, corn fell 5%, and black beans fell 10%. In Changzhi, grain prices have been flat in the past half-month, with millet at 1700-1400 yuan per dou, wheat at 1900 yuan per dou, and corn at 600-800 yuan. Compared with the general price in October: rice and miscellaneous grains were flat, and wheat rose 8-10%. In Taiyue Jiyuan, from the 1st to the 10th, millet rose from 2400 yuan to 2800 yuan per dou, wheat rose from 1750 yuan to 2200 yuan, and corn rose from 1200 yuan to 1600 yuan, which were the same as in the second half of October. In southern Shanxi, grain prices were stable in the first ten days of the month: in Yishi and Jihe, wheat was generally 900-1000 yuan per dou, and corn was around 500 yuan. From the rise and fall of grain, wheat, due to the low output this year, the demand has not decreased, coupled with seasonal factors, so the price is rising. Rice and miscellaneous grains are generally flat due to the new autumn market. In mid-month, the collection of public grain has been completed, and the grain situation is still expected to be stable.

    Cotton: In the past two weeks, the price first rose, then fell, and then remained flat. After the suspension of cotton exports from the eastern front, cotton prices in various regions rose sharply and then leveled off. In Puyang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, it once reached more than 1,000 yuan per jin at the beginning of the month. After the 3rd, due to unfavorable exports, it fell back to 850 yuan, and then fell again to 800-780 yuan on the 9th, a drop of about 6% compared with the general price in October, and a drop of 30% compared with the sharp rise in the second half of October. In Linqing, Ji'nan, from the 1st to the 17th, it fell from 800 yuan to 750-780 yuan, a drop of 13% compared with the second half of October. In Nangong, the price has been flat in the past half-month, at 750 yuan per jin, the same as in the second half of October. In Hengshui, from the 1st to the 12th, it fell from 900 yuan to 800 yuan per jin, a drop of 20% compared with the sharp rise in the second half of October. In Handan City, from the 1st to the 15th, it rose from 670 yuan to 720 yuan, an increase of about 14% compared with the general price in October. In Taihang, the general price is significantly higher: in Gaoyi, the price was flat from the 1st to the 15th, at 650 yuan per jin, the same as the price in the first ten days of October. In Xingtai, it has been 800 yuan per jin in the past half-month, an increase of 14% compared with the general price in October. In Yangyi, it was 750-800 yuan, the same as in the second half of October. In Changzhi, it has been flat in the past half-month, at around 720 yuan per jin. In Taiyue Jiyuan, the price was flat from the 1st to the 10th, at 850-900 yuan per jin, the same as the price in October. In southern Shanxi, the opening of Yumengkou to cotton shipments to the west has led to a price increase. In Yishi, on the 11th, the price rose from 500 yuan to 600 yuan per jin. The rate of cotton price increase is second only to grain. The price increase started in the east and spread to the west. Now the eastern front is generally falling, but the western front is still high. In various friendly liberated areas and Chiang Kai-shek areas, cotton prices have risen in November: in Bozhen and Xiaofan in central Hebei, the price has reached 8,000-10,000 yuan per jin in the first ten days of the month, an increase of 20-25% compared with October. In the Bohai area, cotton prices rose sharply to 900 yuan per jin at the beginning of the month, but due to the suspension of exports, it fell back to around 700 yuan on the 11th. Cotton prices in the Chiang Kai-shek area have been soaring: cotton in Jinan soared in the second half of October. It once tended to stabilize due to the tightening of currency, but in November, it boiled again, rising from 2.8 million yuan to 3.4 million yuan on the 6th. Xi'an, a cotton-producing area, is also currently rising in price. According to the price on October 31, it rose from 22,000 yuan to 28,000 yuan per jin from the previous month. Our district's cotton price fluctuations are related.

    Native Cloth: In the past half-month, the price has been rising. The price of cloth throughout the district has generally risen by more than 40% from the second half of October to the present, which is the first increase in recent years, with the eastern front being the highest and the western front being the second highest. In Puyang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, on the 14th, each double foot was 320 yuan, an increase of 42% compared with the second half of October. In Linqing, Ji'nan, from the 1st to the 12th, it rose from 350 yuan to 400 yuan per double foot, an increase of 60% compared with the second half of October; in Nangong, on the 17th, each double foot was 320 yuan, the same as the price in the second half of October; in Guangping, on the 14th, each foot of 7 chi was 350 yuan, the same as in the second half of October. In Handan, from the 1st to the 15th, each double foot was 330 yuan, an increase of about 10% compared with the second half of October. The rate of increase in Taihang is smaller. In Gaoyi, the price was flat on the 15th, at 240 yuan per 16 chi, an increase of 20% compared with the general price in October. In Xingtai, on the 17th, each 16 chi was 280 yuan, an increase of 12% compared with the general price in October. In Yangyi, in the past half-month, each jin rose from 1900 yuan to 2200 yuan, an increase of about 30% compared with the general price in October; the price in Changzhi was flat, on the 15th, each 16 chi was 270-250 yuan, an increase of 22% compared with October. The increase in Taiyue is even smaller. In the first ten days of the month, each chi in Guodao and Chuan was 160 yuan, the same as the price in September and October; in Jiyuan, each roll was 4600-550 yuan, the same as the price in October. Weaving is currently underway, and the price of cloth is expected to be stable.

    Salt: In the past half-month, sea salt has remained high, while nitrate salt has entered the market, and Lu salt has come from the west, keeping prices stable. Salt prices in various regions: in Puyang, on the 14th, sea salt was 250 yuan per jin, the same as in the second half of October; in Linqing, on the 17th, it rose 70% to 185 yuan, an increase of 10% compared with the second half of October; in Nangong, in December, it was 200 yuan, an increase of 25% compared with October; in Handan, on the 16th, nitrate salt entered the market at 100 yuan per jin for good quality and 60 yuan for second quality, while sea salt was 240 yuan. Due to the entry of nitrate salt, sea salt was weak, with daily transactions of several hundred to more than a thousand jin; in Gaoyi, on the 15th, nitrate salt was 100-83 yuan per jin. Because the local people are accustomed to eating nitrate salt, and because sea salt is expensive and scarce, its sales are smooth, with daily transactions of several thousand jin; in Xingtai, sea salt is particularly expensive, rising to 288 yuan per jin on the 15th, an increase of 60% compared with the second half of October; in Yangyi, from the 1st to the 15th, it was 240-260 yuan per jin; in Changzhi, on the 15th, due to the entry of Lu salt, it was 230-240 yuan per jin, which was 30-40 yuan lower than sea salt per jin. At the moment, the salt market is stable, with sea salt at 290 yuan, an increase of 42% compared with the general price in October. In Taiyue, because the Lucun salt pond has been controlled by us in the past half-month, the price is generally flat; the price in southern Shanxi is still low. In the first ten days of the month, the wholesale price in Yishi was 50-40 yuan per jin, but it is still expensive in northern Yue due to transportation issues, and Lu salt in Hechuan was 240 yuan on the 5th. The reason for the high price of sea salt is mainly the price increase in Bohai, which once reached 145 yuan per jin in Deshi on the 4th, and strict control over salt exports, and salt cannot be exchanged without the goods designated by the area. In addition, the salt in Hebei-Chahar-Jin has also soared. In Fuping, Quyang, Hunyuan and other places, the price of salt in October has increased five to seven times. Recently, nitrate salt has entered the market. During the summer of this year, the masses in Ji'nan prepared a lot of nitrate salt to prevent drought and prepare for famine. According to incomplete statistics in Jize County alone, about 160,000 jin were produced from January to May. At present, the activity of nitrate salt is still expected to keep sea salt stable.

    Foreign Goods: In the past half-month, except for paper, other imported goods have been stable and even declined: in Puyang, the price of large sheet paper has risen sharply due to the purchase and storage of local cigarette factories, reaching 85,000 yuan on the 14th, an increase of about 30% compared with October. Due to the large amount of sugar entering the market, the price has fallen to 1300-1200 yuan per jin. In Linqing, from the 1st to the 17th, Nanjing matches fell from 73,000 yuan to 68,000 yuan, and pink paper rose from 75,000 yuan to 85,000 yuan, an increase of 25% compared with October. In Handan, in the past half-month, Nanjing matches fell from 77,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan, Bat Brand blue cloth was 150,000 yuan, fast indigo rose from 175,000 yuan to 195,000 yuan, and glazed paper was 83,000 yuan. Compared with the general price in October: matches were flat, blue cloth rose 4%, fast indigo rose about 12%, and paper rose about 20%. Due to the control of cotton exports, the source of foreign exchange has decreased, and not many foreign goods have entered the market.

    Mountain Goods: Due to smooth exports, the price of hemp skins in Taiyue has risen sharply. In Guodao, Lu hemp rose to 600 yuan per jin in the first ten days of the month. The Taihang area is also fast. In Changzhi, on the 15th, white hemp rose from 390 yuan to 450 yuan, and was sold to Xingtai. In Xingtai, on the 12th, white hemp rose to 550 yuan per jin. After the liberation of Shizhuang, the export of mountain goods may be smooth and profitable.

II. Financial Situation

    Since the end of October, our Ji'nan District has strictly managed the export of cotton and cotton wadding, requiring the exchange for necessities. The foreign exchange market was temporarily silent, and the exchange rate once rose because of this, but it soon fell back. In Linqing, on November 15, the price of Jinan drafts was 21 yuan and 3 jiao to 1, and Tianjin exchange was 21 yuan and 8 jiao; in Nangong, on the 14th, Tianjin exchange was 22 yuan and 7 jiao; in Hengshui, on the 15th, Tianjin exchange was 21 yuan and 8 jiao; in Xiajin, on the 14th, Jinan exchange was 22 yuan and 2 jiao, and Tianjin exchange was 20 yuan. In Taihang, the price in Baobi in Huixian, Shuiye Town in Anyang, and Tangyin around the 15th was 25 yuan to 1; on the 15th, it was 50 yuan to 1 in Pingding, and 30-40 yuan to 1 in Taigu on the 15th. In Taiyue and southern Shanxi, the monetary position has been greatly expanded, the circulation area of our currency has been expanding, and the ratio of our currency to Chiang Kai-shek's currency on November 15 has reached 20 to 1 in (new) Jiangnan and Wenxi and Xiaxian, 15 yuan to 1 in Ji (Shan) and He (Jin), and 14 yuan to 1 in Ronghe. In Pingyao and Jiexiu in mid-November, it was 36 yuan to 1, in Huoxian and Zhaocheng it was 35 yuan to 1, and in the new district of Mengxian on the 10th it was 22 yuan to 1. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area north of the Yellow River, the market for Chiang Kai-shek's currency has not changed much. In mid-November, in Junxian, Qingfeng, and Gaoling, it was 25 yuan to 1. In the area south of the Yellow River, with the restoration of social order and the decline in prices, the value of our currency has also increased. In Pandu Collection in northern Yuncheng in early November, the black market for Chiang Kai-shek's currency has reached 20 to 25 yuan to 1. Comprehensively considering the situation in the entire district, as of November 15, the average exchange rate of Chiang Kai-shek's currency was above 25 yuan to 1.

    Gold and Silver: In the first half of November in Xingtai and Handan, the black market price of gold rose from 175,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan per tael, mostly flowing to central Hebei. The listed price has been raised to 160,000 yuan, and the black market price of silver dollars has risen to more than 1,000 yuan, with a listed price of 800 yuan. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area south of the Yellow River, the price of silver dollars continued to fall, and at the beginning of the month, it had fallen to 2,000 to 2,500 yuan in Yuancheng, northern Yuncheng, and other places. There were no major changes in other places.

    In the past two weeks, the value of currency in friendly neighboring areas has risen. The Jin-Chahar-Hebei border currency has successively risen to about 8 yuan to 1 in Gaoyi, Xingtai, Nangong, Hengshui and other places in our area in mid-November, and is still 10 yuan to 1 in the Pingding area. The reason for the rise in border currency is: 1. After the liberation of Shimen, merchants rushed to buy border currency to purchase goods. 2. We need to use some border currency to purchase military industrial equipment in central Hebei. 3. The autumn tax collection in central Hebei is discounted, the籌码 are tight, and prices have fallen. The Shandong Beihai banknotes also rose sharply. On the 14th, the ratio of Beihai banknotes to our banknotes in Xiajin was 1 yuan and 3 jiao to 1, 1 yuan and 6 jiao to 1 in Pingyuan on the same day, 1 yuan and 7 jiao to 1 in the black market, and 1 yuan and 1 jiao to 1 for the listed price in Linqing and 1 yuan and 5 jiao to 1 in Dezhou during the same period. The reasons for the rise are: 1. Recently, prices in the Bohai area have been stable and slightly lower than in our area. 2. Salt prices in our area have risen sharply in recent months, and merchants have taken the opportunity to import a large amount of salt from Bohai, while we have not exported many goods.

    In the past two weeks, the money market has been tight, and the inter-regional exchange work has been developing day by day. In addition to the previously established exchange trunk and branch lines, the Taiyue area has also reorganized and arranged new exchange points. In addition, Xingtai has also mutually connected with Bozhen and Xinji in central Hebei, and the business is very prosperous.

    一、商情物价：
    半月来本区各物先涨后平，其中以盐、布及外来纸张涨率最大，白麻亦显上扬。地区方面：冀鲁豫粮涨为猛。各地，各物自十日后转趋平稳或下降。详次：
    粮食：上旬中，各地秋征，粮上市少，价一般逞涨，尤以冀鲁豫因受黄河南粮高影响，升势较猛。濮阳清丰半月来麦升百分之三十以上。冀南：临清九日前小米每斤曾达一五六元，麦子一五○元，红粮九○元，以后趋下，十七日小米每斤一三四元，麦子一四四元，红粮七○元，各粮与十月中旬相平。南宫半月间麦平每斤一六○元，米跌，一六○元降为一五○——一四○元，比之十月下半月，米跌约百分之六，麦升百分之二，杂粮平。邯郸市一日至十五日，小米每斤由一四五元，跌为一三五元，麦子由一四五元升为一五○——一六○元，杂粮平，玉茭八○元左右，红粮七六元左右，豆子九五元左右，各粮比之十月下旬米平，麦升约百分之三，杂粮跌百分之四——五。太行：高邑自六日后，米趋下，麦仍昂，杂粮平，小米每市斤由一六○元，跌为一五○元，麦子一七○——一八三元，红粮一○○元左右，各粮比之十月终相平。邢台各粮均昂，十五日小米一六七元，麦子一八三元，玉茭一○五元。阳邑一日至十五日小米由一七○——一五○元，降为一三二——一四○元，麦由一七三元降为一六○元，玉茭九○元平，黑豆由一四○元降为一二○元，各粮比十月下旬：米平，麦升百分之十一，玉茭降百分之五，黑豆降百分之一○。长治半月来各粮均平，小米每斗一七○○——一四○○元，麦子每斗一九○○元，玉茭六○○——八○○元，各粮比十月一般价：米杂平，麦升百分之八——一○。太岳济源一日至十日小米每斗由二四○○元涨到二八○○元，麦子由一七五○元涨为二二○○元，玉茭由一二○○元升为一六○○元，各粮比之十月下旬相平。晋南上旬各粮平稳：猗氏、稷河小麦每斗均在九○○——一○○○元，玉茭五○○元左右。从粮食升降中，麦子，由于本年产量较薄，需用不减，加以季节关系，故价逞昂，米杂以新秋上市，一般价持平。中旬公粮征收已毕，粮势仍看平稳。
    棉花：两周来由升转降继平，东线棉停出后，各地棉由猛升趋平。冀鲁豫濮阳月初曾达千元以上一斤，三日后，因出口不顺，回跌为八五○元九日后复跌为八○○——七八○元，比之十月一般价跌约百分之六，比之十月下旬猛涨时跌百分之三十。冀南临清一日至十七日由八○○元跌为七五○——七八○元，比十月下旬跌百分之十三。南宫半月来价平，每斤七五○元，与十月下旬比平。衡水一日至十二日，每斤由九○○元跌为八○○元，比十月下旬猛涨时跌百分之二十。邯郸市一日至十五日，由六七○元升为七二○元，比十月一般价升约百分之十四。太行一般价显昂：高邑一日至十五日价平，每斤六五○元，同十月上旬价。邢台半月来均为八○○元一斤，比十月一般价升百分之十四。阳邑七五○——八○○元，同十月下旬。长治半月来平，每斤七二○元左右。太岳济源一日至十日价平，每斤八五○——九○○元，同十月价。晋南禹门口近开放棉西去一部因之价升，猗氏十一日每市斤由五○○元升为六○○元。棉价涨率仅次于粮，其涨势：先起于东波及于西，现东线一般下跌，但西线仍显高。各友邻解放区及蒋区入十一月来，棉均升：冀中泊镇及小范上旬已达八○○○——一○○○○元一斤，比十月升百之分二十——二十五。渤海区月初棉猛升到九○○元一斤，后因停出，十一日回为七○○元左右。蒋区棉价飞涨不已：济南棉在十月后半月飞涨，一度因紧缩通货渐趋稳，但到十一月份，又行沸腾，六日由二八○万元涨到三四○万元，西安为产棉地，目前价亦在上涨，据十月三十一日价，每斤由上月之二二○○○元涨到二八○○○元。我区棉价涨落有关。
    土布：半月来价逞昂，全区布价从十月下旬截止刻下一般升百分之四十以上，为年来首次上升，东线为最，西线次之。冀鲁豫濮阳十四日每双尺三二○元，比十月下半月升百分之四二，冀南临清一日至十二日由每双尺三五○涨到四○○元，比十月下半月升百分之六十；南宫十七日每双尺三二○元，与十月下旬价同；广平十四日每尺七尺三五○元同十月下旬。邯郸一日至十五日每双尺均为三三○元，比十月下旬升约百分之一○。太行方面涨率较小，高邑十五日价平，每一六尺二四○元，比十月一般价升百分之二十，邢台十七日每一六尺二八○元，比十月一般价涨百分之一二。阳邑半月来每市斤由一九○○元升为二二○○元，比十月一般价升约百分之三十；长治价平，十五日每一六尺二七○——二五○元，比十月升百分之二二。太岳涨势更次，上旬郭道和川每市尺均一六○元，同九、十月价；济源每匹四六○○——五五○元，同十月价。目前纺织正进行中，布将看稳。
    食盐：半月来海盐仍高，硝盐上市，潞盐西来，价平。各地盐价：濮阳十四日海盐每斤二五○元，同十月下旬；临清十七日一八五元升百分之七十，比十月下旬升百分之十；南宫十二月二○○元，比十月升百分之二五；邯郸十六日硝盐上市每斤好货一○○元次六○元，海盐二四○元，由于硝盐上市，海盐显疲，日成交数百斤至千余斤；高邑十五日硝盐每斤一○○——八三元，由于当地群众惯食硝盐，并因海盐昂缺，其销畅，日成交数千余斤；邢台海盐特昂，十五日每斤涨到二八八元，比十月下旬升百分之六十；阳邑一日至十五日每斤二四○——二六○元；长治十五日由于潞盐进市每斤二三○——二四○元，较之海盐每斤低三、四十元，刻下盐市平稳，海盐二九○元，比十月一般价升百分之四二。太岳半月来因潞村盐池为我控制，价一般平；晋南价仍低，上旬猗氏每斤批发五○——四○元，但岳北因交通关系仍昂，和川五日潞盐二四○元。海盐高涨原因：主要渤海价涨，德市四日曾达一四五元一斤，并对盐出口管制严格，非有该区指定货物换不出盐。另外冀察晋盐亦飞腾，阜平、曲阳、浑源等地十月份盐涨五倍——七倍不一。近来硝盐上市，冀南当本年夏季群众为防旱备荒熬硝盐不少，仅就鸡泽一县一月——五月不完全统计约出十六万余斤，目前硝盐活动，海盐仍看平稳。
    外货：半月来各外来品除纸张升腾外，其他均平稳，且降：濮阳大板纸因当地卷烟厂购存价涨猛，十四日已达八五○○○元，较之十月升约百分之三○，糖因入多价落，每斤为一三○○——一二○○元。临清一日至十七日南京火柴由七三○○○元降到六八○○○元，粉连纸由七五○○○元涨到八五○○○元，比之十月升百分之二五。邯郸半月来，南京火柴由七七○○○元跌为七○○○○元，蝠利袋青一五万元，快靛由一七五○○○元，涨到一九五○○○元，有光纸八三○○○元，各货比之十月一般价：火柴平，袋青升百分之四，快靛升约百分之一二，纸升约百分之二十。由于棉花出口管制，外汇来源减少，外货入口不多。
    山货：太岳麻皮因出口顺价昂，郭道上旬潞麻每斤涨到六○○元。太行方面亦快，长治十五日白麻由三九○元涨到四五○元，销邢台。邢台十二日白麻涨到五五○元一斤。石庄解放后山货外销或会畅利。
    二、金融情况
    我冀南区自十月底严格管理棉花，及棉绒出口必须换回必需品后，外汇市场一时沉寂，汇价亦因之一度上扬，但不久即回跌。临清十一月十五日济南汇票价一比二十一元三角，津汇二十一元八角；南宫十四日津汇二十二元七角；衡水十五日津汇二十一元八角；夏津十四日济汇二十二元二角，津汇二十元。太行辉县之薄壁、安阳之水冶镇及汤阴十五日前后均一比二十五元；平定十五日为一比五十元，太谷十五日一比三十至四十元。太岳晋南货币阵地大有开展，本币流通区日益扩大，本币与蒋币之比十一月十五日在（新）绛南及闻喜、夏县均已至一比二十，稷（山）河（津）一比十五元，荣河一比十四元，他如平遥、介休十一月中旬为一比三十六元，霍县、赵城为一比三十五元，孟县新区十日为一比二十二元。冀鲁豫黄河北蒋币行情无大变化，十一月中浚县、清丰、高陵均一比二十五元，黄河南地区随着社会秩序之恢复，及物价之下降，本币币值亦随之提高，郓北潘渡集十一月上旬蒋币黑市已至一比二十至二十五元。综合全区情况，截至十一月十五日为止，蒋币汇价平均在一比二十五元以上。
    金银：邢台、邯郸十一月上半月黄金黑市每两十七万五千升至二十二万元，多流向冀中，挂牌已提至十六万，银元黑市升至一千元以上，挂牌八百元。冀鲁豫黄河南银元价续降，月初在鄄城、郓北等地已跌至二千至二千五百元，他地无大变化。
    两周来，友邻区货币币值上升，晋察冀边币于十一月中在我高邑、邢台、南宫、衡水等地均已先后升至一比八元左右，平定一带仍一比十元。边币上升原因为：一、石门解放后，商人纷纷抢购边币，前去办货。二、我在冀中区采购军工器材需用一部边币。三、冀中秋征折款，筹码紧缩，物价下跌。山东北海钞亦逞涨，夏津十四日北比本为一比一元三角，平原同日为一比一元六，黑市一元七，同期临清挂牌一元一角，德州一比一元五角。其上升原因为：一、最近渤海区物价平稳，并较我区略低。二、我区近月盐价猛涨，商人趁机自渤海输入大量食盐，我输出货不多。
    近两周市场银根较紧，区内汇兑工作亦日渐开展，除前设汇兑干、支线外，太岳区并又重新整顿布置，新设通汇点若干处，此外邢台向冀中泊镇与辛集亦已互通汇兑，业务甚旺。
