　　Shahe: Over Ten Thousand Women Organized for Spinning and Weaving

    [This newspaper Shahe News] The county's spinning and weaving work, after a year of developing organizations, improving tools, and household profit sharing, has now entered a new stage. This spring, in villages such as Chaiguan and Cejing in the Second District, small-scale kerosene mutual aid groups among spinning women were first discovered (three or five people gather together at night to save oil and spin more thread). The leadership immediately promoted and developed this, and it has now spread to villages throughout the county, with organizations totaling about 15,000 people, accounting for one-third of the total number of spinning and weaving women. Among them, a few groups have further implemented a scientific division of labor between spinning and weaving, moving towards equivalent exchange. The development of kerosene mutual aid has not only saved a significant amount of kerosene but also boosted the morale of spinning women and increased the quantity of spun yarn. For example, the women's association director of Dayou Village in the Third District, Lu Xiao'ai's group of twelve people, spun yarn and wove 185 jin of cloth in five months last year. This year, after implementing organization, they spun yarn and wove 1,389 jin of cloth in the same amount of time, more than twice as fast as before. On average, before the implementation of kerosene mutual aid, each woman spun and wove three jin of cloth per month; after kerosene mutual aid, each woman spun and wove six jin of cloth per month. The successful improvement and experimentation of spinning and weaving tools over the past year has greatly improved spinning and weaving efficiency. There are now 10,000 women using new spinning wheels (accelerated wheels). After mastering this new type of spinning wheel, their yarn production increased by one-third. For example, Du Cheng, a woman from Mengshigang in the Second District, used an old spinning wheel before and participated in kerosene mutual aid, weaving six jin of cloth per month. Now, using a new spinning wheel, she wove ten jin of cloth in the first month of learning. Women are extremely interested in small iron looms that can weave five zhang of cloth per day (which can be doubled if using foreign thread), and they are all carrying rice and rushing to the county and district iron loom training classes to learn. Village cooperative cadres implemented a spinning and weaving profit-sharing system to resolve conflicts between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. This not only improved spinning and weaving in the new district but also reconciled their family relationships, which the women responded to very well.
    In short, Shahe's spinning and weaving work has seen great development and improvement after a year of effort. In the past, each woman wove three jin of cloth per month, now they weave nine jin; in the past, each jin of cloth was less than fifteen square feet, now it is seventeen square feet. Even calculating at this rate, the county's 45,000 spinning and weaving women, averaging seven months of spinning and weaving per year, can weave 2,735,000 jin of cloth. (Wang Dehua)

　　沙河万余妇女组织起来纺织
    【本报沙河讯】本县纺织工作，经过一年来发展组织、改良工具、与家庭分红等，现已步入新阶段。今春在二区柴关、册井等村，首先发现了纺妇们的小型的灯油互助后（夜晚三五人凑合在一起，省油多纺线），领导上即加以提倡发展，现在普遍到全县各个村落里，组织约有一万五千人，占纺织妇女总数三分之一；其中并有少数组，又进一步实行纺与织的科学分工，走向了等价交换。发展了灯油互助后，不仅是节省了大量的灯油，而且提高了纺妇情绪与纺花数量。如三区大油村妇救会主任路小爱组十二人，去年五个月纺线织成布一八五斤，今年实行了组织起来，在同样时间纺线织成布一三八九斤，较前快了一倍。平均计算未实行灯油互助前每个妇女一月纺织三斤布，灯油互助后，一个妇女每月纺织六斤布。一年来纺织工具改良与实验的成功，大大的提高了纺织效能。使用新纺车（加速轮）的妇女现有一万人，她们掌握了此种新式纺车后，纺花量即提高三分之一。如二区孟石岗妇女杜成的，前使旧纺车，参加了灯油互助，每月纺织布六斤，现用上新纺车，在学会的第一个月，即纺织了十斤布。妇女们对于每天能织五丈布的小铁机（如是洋线可加快一倍），极感兴趣，大家都是背着米抢着到县区铁机训练班来学习。村合作社干部们从解决婆媳纠纷中，实行了纺织分红制，这样在新区提高了纺织，又和解了她们家庭中的关系，妇女反映很好。
    总之，沙河纺织工作，经过这样一年努力，是有了很大的发展与提高。过去每个妇女一月织布三斤，现织到九斤；过去每斤布量不到十五方尺，现织到十七方尺。就以这样的速度来计算，全县四万五千个纺织妇女，全年平均纺织七个月，可织布二百七十三万五千斤。（王德华）
