　　Celebrating 160,000 Class Brothers Joining the People's Liberation Army
　　The largest military conscription movement in our region since the Self-Defense War has come to an end. According to incomplete statistics from various regions, more than 300,000 people signed up for military service. After review and assessment by the masses themselves, and due to adjustments and consideration of labor force needs, 160,000 people were actually approved to join the People's Liberation Army. This includes over 50,000 from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, over 40,000 from the Southern Hebei region, and over 30,000 each from the Taihang and Taiyue regions. The scale of this conscription is larger than any previous one, and the quality is purer. Those with landlord and rich peasant backgrounds who requested to join the army were all rejected by the emancipated masses themselves. According to statistics from Qinyang County in the Taihang region, poor and hired peasants accounted for 61.5 percent of those enlisted, and middle peasants accounted for 38.5 percent. In all regions, the proportion of poor and hired peasants among those enlisted was above 50 percent. Among them, Communist Party members and district/village cadres accounted for 18 to 20 percent or more, and militia members accounted for about 40 percent. The mobilization slogans were clear, such as "Join the main force and go to Henan together" and "Fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." The masses understood that they were joining the main force and going south of the Yellow River when they enlisted. At the same time, attention was generally paid to saving resources, reducing unnecessary expenses by three to five times (military conscription used to be extravagant and wasteful). In terms of leadership, the mass line was adhered to, and the tendency of coercive orders was corrected. Judging from the scale and achievements of this conscription, it is indeed a mass conscription movement.
　　The unprecedented increase in the people's awareness after the land reform and the emancipation of peasants is fully demonstrated and is the fundamental reason for the significant achievements of this conscription movement. Due to the impact of the war, the masses deeply realized that in order to completely emancipate themselves and ensure the benefits and fruits they have gained, they must strengthen the People's Liberation Army and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. Only by placing the People's Liberation Army under the control of their own class brothers can they forever defend their land and "country." Without this unprecedented increase in the masses' class consciousness, the movement would not have been so fast, and the scale would not have been so large. Due to the unprecedented increase in the masses' class consciousness, the masses themselves formulated extremely strict class disciplines. First of all, they had to actively join the army and resolutely reject landlords and rich peasants from infiltrating our army. They were extremely resentful of the bad behavior of some district and village cadres who hid behind the conscription movement, put on airs, shouted empty slogans about getting through to the masses' thinking, but were afraid to join the army themselves and forced the masses to join. In many places, the masses spontaneously rose up and waged a solemn struggle against this bad behavior. The masses themselves proposed to get through to the cadres' thinking, conduct democratic appraisals, be fair and reasonable, accurately calculate labor force needs, and squeeze cadres into joining the army. They also adopted an attitude of contempt and rejection towards the wasteful phenomena of some cadres being extravagant and wasteful, taking the opportunity to eat and drink, and using the excuse of giving gifts and condolences. This shows that the masses understand everything about how to cherish their own regime and their own army after the emancipation of peasants. Increased class consciousness is the greatest force.
　　This conscription movement has also greatly tested our leadership organs and cadres at all levels. All those who have a clear class line, adopt in-depth ideological mobilization, adhere to the principle of voluntary registration, and then conduct democratic appraisal in a fair and reasonable manner, with the masses themselves making the decisions, with the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, and through meetings of activists, family meetings, and other voluntary small group meetings for deliberation and discussion, have achieved a truly mass-based, conscious, and voluntary conscription movement, which has further increased the masses' awareness, mobilized the masses' enthusiasm, and also educated our cadres and improved the relationship between the Party and the masses. However, in many places, although the leadership said in advance that coercive orders were not allowed, due to the deeply rooted bureaucratic style and lack of a class line, lack of in-depth inspection, and the general cadres' accustomed to the past coercive order style, they underestimated the masses' class consciousness and did not believe that the masses would consciously rise up to support the war. They still continued to do everything on their own, using commandism. In particular, some district and village cadres, due to occupying too much of the fruits of the land reform struggle and being selfish and self-interested, have fallen far behind the masses in political awareness. Many cadres initially expressed a lack of confidence in this conscription movement and adopted a set of coercive measures from top to bottom. When the masses themselves rose up to promote the development of the movement and greatly exceeded the planned tasks, these cadres felt "surprised." There were also a few district and village cadres who were unwilling to join the army themselves, so they made false reports to their superiors, slandering the masses: "The masses' awareness is not high, they don't want to join the army after getting the fruits, and the task cannot be completed no matter what." They dared not conduct in-depth ideological mobilization among the masses, fearing that the masses would accuse them of why they didn't join the army themselves. They completely adopted simple and crude methods, even using so-called competitions, rushing time, and expanding tasks layer by layer (for fear of not completing them) to force and oppress the masses. Under these circumstances, some cadres and Party members joined the army only after the masses got through to their thinking (many cadres and Party members did join the army voluntarily), while some masses suffered completely unnecessary grievances under this coercion. However, some leading comrades still lack sufficient understanding of this basic situation, are satisfied with the achievements they have made, and attribute too much credit to the role of "cadres taking the lead," which is not in line with the actual situation of the movement.
　　The conscription of 160,000 people has strengthened the counter-offensive army and marks an unprecedented increase in the masses' awareness, which is a very gratifying aspect. But we must never be complacent about this, carrying burdens on our backs. On the contrary, we must be deeply vigilant about the shortcomings in our work. We must truly stand on a clear class stand, viewpoint, and method, and well accept the education given to us by this movement. We must cherish the masses' awareness, sincerely accept the masses' enthusiasm and courage in fighting against coercive orders, against the sectarianism of Party members and cadres, and against bureaucracy. We must deeply examine our work style, identify and recognize our many cadres. In future work, we must resolutely and thoroughly liquidate and correct all those bad styles that do not conform to the people's voluntary needs and do not follow the mass line.

### 庆祝十六万阶级战士参加人民解放军

　　庆祝十六万阶级战士参加人民解放军
    自卫战争以来我区最大一次的参军运动已经结束。根据各区不完全材料统计：报名参军者三十余万人，经过群众自己审查鉴定以及因调剂和照顾劳力等关系，实际批准参加人民解放军者十六万人。计冀鲁豫区五万余人，冀南区四万余人，太行、太岳区各三万余人。此次参军规模比过去任何一次为大，质量比过去更为纯洁，地主富农成份要求参军者一概为翻身群众自己所拒绝。据太行沁阳县统计，贫雇入伍者占百分之六十一点五，中农占百分之三十八点五。所有地区入伍者贫雇成份均在百分之五十以上。其中共产党员及区村干部占百分之十八到百分之二十以上，民兵占百分之四十左右。动员口号明确，如“参加主力军，一齐下河南”，“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”等，群众在参军时均明了是要参加主力，到黄河以南去的。同时，普遍注意节约，将不必要的开支减少三倍至五倍（过去参军曾是铺张浪费）。领导上则掌握群众路线，纠正强迫命令的偏向。从此次参军规模及其成就来看，确是群众性的参军运动。
    充分显示在土地改革农民翻身以后，人民觉悟程度空前提高，乃是此次参军运动取得重大成绩的基本原因。由于战争的影响，群众深刻体会到要想彻底翻身，保证已得利益和果实，只有壮大人民解放军，打倒蒋介石，只有把人民解放军置于自己阶级弟兄执掌之下，才能永远保卫自己的土地和“江山”。没有群众这种阶级觉悟的空前提高，运动速度就不会这样快，规模就不会这样大。此次参军运动由于群众阶级觉悟空前提高，群众均自己订出极严格的阶级纪律，首先是自己要踊跃参军，坚决拒绝地主富农分子混入我军。他们对于某些区村不良干部躲在参军运动后面，装腔作势，空喊打通群众思想，自己却怕参军，而又强迫群众参军的恶劣行为，是极其痛恨的。许多地方群众自动起来和这种恶劣行为进行了严正的斗争。群众自己提出打通干部思想，民主评议、公平合理、精确计算劳力挤干部参军，对某些干部铺张浪费借机大吃大喝，借口送礼慰劳等浪费现象，亦采取了鄙弃的态度，加以拒绝。这说明了农民翻身后如何爱护自己的政权，爱护自己的军队，群众是懂得一切的。阶级觉悟提高就是最巨大的力量。
    此次参军运动中，也大大的考验了我们各级领导机关和干部。凡具有明确的阶级路线，采取了深入的思想动员、坚持自觉自愿报名，然后加以民主评议公平合理的原则，由群众自己作主，贫雇作骨干，经过积极分子会议，家庭会议，以及其他群众自愿结合的小组会议进行酝酿讨论的群众路线，均作到了真正群众性的自觉自愿的参军运动，进一步提高了群众觉悟，发动了群众的积极性，也教育了我们干部，改进了党与群众的关系。但仍有不少的地方领导上虽然事先也说不准强迫命令，可是由于官僚主义作风积重难返，缺乏阶级路线，缺乏深入检查，与一般干部习惯于过去的强迫命令一套作风，他们对群众的阶级自觉估计不足，不相信群众会自觉起来支援战争，依然继续包办代替、命令主义，特别是有些区村干部由于多占土改斗争果实，自私自利，在政治觉悟上已远落后于群众。许多干部开始对此次参军运动表示无信心，从上而下采取了一套强迫命令的办法，当群众自己起来推动运动发展，并大大超过预定任务之后，这些干部反感觉“意外”；还有少数区村干部，他们自己不愿参军，因而对上级作假报告，污蔑群众：“群众觉悟不高，得了果实不想参军了，任务无论如何不能完成”等等。他们对群众不敢进行深入思想动员，怕群众指责他们自己为什么不参军的时候，他们就完全采取了简单生硬办法，甚至使用所谓竞赛、抢时间，逐层扩大任务（唯恐完不成）的办法，这样来强逼群众压迫群众。在这种情形下，有些干部、党员是群众给他们打通了思想才参了军（有不少干部党员确实是自动参军的），而有些群众则在这种威逼下遭受到完全不应该的委屈，但至今还有某些领导同志对这一基本情况缺乏足够的认识，满足于已得成绩，过分归功于“干部带头”的作用，这是不符合于运动实际情况的。
    十六万人的参军，壮大了反攻大军，标志着群众觉悟的空前提高，这是十分值得欣喜的一面。但我们绝不应以此自满，背上包袱，相反必须深刻警惕我们工作中的缺点。我们必须真正站在明确的阶级立场观点和方法上，很好接受此次运动给我们的教育，珍贵群众的觉悟，诚心诚意的接受群众这种反对强迫命令，反对党员干部的宗派性、反对官僚主义斗争的热情和勇气，深入检查我们的工作作风，鉴定和识别我们许多干部。在今后工作中，坚决把一切不符合于人民自愿与需要的，不走群众路线的那些恶劣作风，彻底加以清算和纠正。
