Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 12th: In the process of rectifying mass discipline, some companies of a certain division of the Democratic Allied Army implemented the "One Check – Check Discipline, One Evaluation – Evaluate Discipline, One Help – Help Avoid Violating Discipline" movement, achieving significant results. The Political Department of the Column has issued a circular to introduce its experience. The circular states: "When the Autumn Offensive began, although everyone had made plans to abide by mass discipline, the phenomenon of violating mass discipline was still relatively common and serious. At that time, activists expressed dissatisfaction, saying: 'Plans are made, but discipline is violated; these plans are just bragging.' The leadership, in response to this public opinion, organized discussions to examine why they still violated discipline after making plans, and at the same time mobilized everyone to check each other's plans to see who had violated them and who had not. During the discipline check, some confused ideas that led to violations of discipline were discovered, such as: 'Military needs,' 'Landlords' things can be taken,' 'No time,' 'It wasn't me who violated it, but someone else gave it to me,' etc. The leadership then guided everyone to discuss whether these counted as violations of discipline. As a result of the discussion, everyone agreed that they were violations of policy. Therefore, after checking and evaluating discipline, the leadership mobilized everyone to reaffirm their determination and organized everyone to launch a mutual assistance movement, to supervise each other, be responsible for each other, and explain to each other." The circular pointed out: "This method of soldiers checking their own plans not only truthfully understands the situation of discipline observance and the determination of the soldiers who made the plans, but also strengthens the soldiers' emphasis on plans and their consciousness of obeying them, overcoming some formalism in the plans. Having soldiers evaluate discipline is a concrete and practical class education that implements the mass line."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 9th: A certain unit of the Liaodong Democratic Allied Army promulgated "Eight Essentials and Eight Prohibitions of Mass Discipline," to supplement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention put forward by the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army. The Eight Essentials are: (1) Promote land policy and raise the consciousness of poor people to turn themselves over. (2) Implement open-warehouse disaster relief to help poor people turn themselves over. (3) Help poor people with labor and strengthen the relationship between the army and the people. (4) Maintain order, eliminate bandits, and protect the interests of the people. (5) Respect democratic regimes and people's organizations. (6) Protect public buildings and cultural institutions. (7) Respect the customs and habits of the people and unite minority nationalities. (8) Pay attention to public health at all times. The Eight Prohibitions are: (1) Do not solicit or accept any fruits of struggle from farmers who have turned themselves over. (2) No unit or individual is allowed to privately misuse landlords' belongings. (3) Do not use crops carrying grain to make fires, and prohibit horses from gnawing tree bark. (4) Do not forcibly exchange carts and horses or arbitrarily conscript laborers. (5) Do not threaten the common people with weapons. (6) Do not arbitrarily use or ask for the common people's belongings and lose tools and furniture. (7) Do not set official prices privately for forced purchases. (8) Do not harass women. The unit is now rectifying discipline based on this mass discipline code and calling on the entire unit to make contributions in the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people.

    东北我军整顿纪律
    通过战士自己检查计划
    启发了遵守纪律自觉性
    【新华社东北十二日电】民主联军某师在整顿群众纪律中，部分连队实行了“一查——查纪律、一评——评纪律、一助——帮助不犯纪律”运动，获得显著效果。纵队政治部顷特发布通报，介绍其经验。通报略称：“该师在秋季攻势开始时，大家虽然订了遵守群众纪律的计划，但违犯群众纪律的现象，还是较普遍和严重，当时积极分子表示不满说：‘订了计划，违犯纪律，这些计划是吹牛皮，’领导上则针对这一舆论，组织座谈，检讨自己为什么订了计划还犯纪律，同时发动大家互相检查计划，究竟谁犯了，谁没有犯。在查纪律中，又发现造成违犯纪律的一些糊涂思想，如说：‘军事需要’、‘地主的东西可以拿’、‘时间来不及’、‘不是我犯是人家给的’等等，领导上便启发大家进行讨论，究竟这一些算不算犯纪律，讨论结果，都认为是违犯政策的，因此，查纪律，评纪律后，领导上又发动大家重下决心，并组织大家展开互助运动，互相监督，互相负责，互相解释。通报中指出：这种通过战士自己检查计划的办法，不但真实的了解遵守纪律的情形，了解订计划的战士的决心，而且加强了战士对计划的重视和遵守的自觉性，克服了计划中的某些形式主义。通过战士来评纪律是一个贯彻群众路线具体实际的阶级教育。
