　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army has received a warm welcome and assistance from the people in the newly liberated areas. As soon as the battle to liberate Xuchang ended, villages along the railway immediately mobilized 500 carts and dozens of small carts, forming a grand procession into the city, voluntarily offering to help the People's Liberation Army transport the spoils of war. On the night of the 13th, after the People's Liberation Army entered Qiuzhuang, 30 miles west of Xuchang city, they cleaned the floors of civilian houses and filled the water tanks that night. Villagers who had fled due to the war returned home before dawn and offered sweet potatoes, peanuts, and other treats to the People's Liberation Army. They vied with each other to recount the various miseries they had suffered under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. One villager took out a large roll of IOUs from Chiang Kai-shek's government and showed it to the People's Liberation Army. He said, "These are Chiang Kai-shek's exorbitant taxes and levies. I didn't taste a single grain of the wheat I harvested this year; it was all paid as military grain. More than thirty people have starved to death in this small village of forty or fifty households, and the village head came the day before yesterday to urge us to pre-pay next year's land tax." An Italian missionary told reporters, "In reality, the common people are longing for the Eighth Route Army to come. They are suffering too much under the (Chiang Kai-shek) central government."
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 23rd: Delayed news: Xinan in western Henan was recaptured by us for the third time on the 15th. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the city have fled in the direction of Luoyang.
    Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi Front, 23rd: On the night of the 14th, when our army liberated Lin'ying County town on the east side of the Pinghan Railway, Chiang Kai-shek's troops abandoned a large number of wounded soldiers. The Fourth Station Hospital of the Joint Logistics Command alone had more than 240. They crawled along the streets, crying for their parents. The People's Liberation Army, with great sympathy, took them in, had medical personnel treat them, and allocated a warehouse of wheat to them. Those who recovered and were able to move were given travel expenses to return home according to their personal wishes.

　　许昌人民倾诉蒋匪压榨惨状
  　热烈欢迎协助解放军
  　豫西我军第三次收复新安城
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十三日电】解放军受到新解放区人民的热烈欢迎和帮助。解放许昌之战刚一结束，沿铁路各村庄立即集中五百辆大车和数十辆小车浩浩荡荡进城，自请帮助解放军搬运战利品。十三日夜，解放军进驻许昌城西三十里之邱庄后，当夜即将民房地上打扫干净，水缸挑得满满的。因战争逃避的村民不到拂晓即相率回家，纷纷拿出红薯、花生等款待解放军。争相诉说他们在蒋匪统治时期所受之各种惨苦。一个村民拿出一大卷蒋匪政府要款的条子给解放军看，他说：“这就是蒋介石的苛捐杂税，我今年收的麦子，自己一颗也没有尝到，都缴军粮了。这个四五十户的小庄，已经饿死三十多个了，前天保长又来催预缴明年的田赋”。一位意籍牧师告记者说：“实实在在，老百姓是盼望八路军来，他们在（蒋匪）中央政府底下太痛苦了”。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十三日电】迟到消息：豫西新安于十五日第三次为我收复，该城蒋匪已向洛阳方向逃窜。
    【新华社豫鄂陕前线二十三日电】十四日夜，我军解放平汉路东侧临颖县城时，蒋匪遗弃大批伤兵，仅联合勤务司令部第四兵站医院即有二百四十余名。他们沿街乱爬，呼爹唤娘。解放军当以高度同情心把他们收容由医务人员治疗，并拨给他们一仓库麦子。伤愈及已能行动的，都照其个人意愿发给旅费返家。
