	Assault
		Zēng Kè
	In the dark of night, just as the troops had finished their fortifications, they received the order to assault the enemy.
	The main attack mission was assigned to the ninth squad of the tenth platoon. Before the squad leader could finish his simple mobilization speech, liberation soldier Yang Hanying, holding two hand grenades in his hands, pointed at his mutual aid group leader, Wang Yinxi, and challenged him, saying, "Old Wang, tonight I'm going to have a showdown with you, you little shepherd. Let's both arm our hand grenades and see who gets more kills! Let the squad leader be the judge."
	The honest and silent peasant soldier Wang Yinxi, smiled and accepted the challenge. Ninth Squad Leader Zhang Youfu turned up the lamp and also expressed his determination to everyone:
	"Everyone, listen to the command, attack fiercely! If I sacrifice myself or get wounded, don't worry about me, follow the deputy squad leader and complete the mission."
	Yang Hanying, with a basket for explosives slung over his arm, walked behind the group leader. At this moment, he recalled being conscripted into the Eighty-eighth Division by the Kuomintang and sent to the front lines. He was wounded during the defense of Shan County and left for dead in a pool of blood. Instead, it was the People's Liberation Army stretcher bearers who picked him up. This personal experience made him understand the meaning of "life after death" most profoundly. Every time he heard gunfire, this memory became clearer. After recovering from his injuries, he volunteered to join the People's Liberation Army. At the time, he had only a simple thought: to repay kindness and seek revenge. However, in the months since, life in the People's Liberation Army had taught him many new principles. He knew that this army was not just his savior, but the savior of all poor people. He had personally seen that as soon as a place was liberated by this army, the poor people there had food and clothing. His squadmates, except for the liberated soldiers like himself, had all volunteered to join the army. They told him that the People's Liberation Army was their own army. He had also made up his mind to stay with this army. As they approached the enemy, a matter he was eagerly hoping to resolve rushed to his mind. He hurried forward, grabbed the group leader's arm, and asked as they walked:
	"Um, about my thing, is it going to work out?"
	"The squad leader said he's already talked to the branch, and after this battle, the Party committee will approve it soon. Just do a good job!" Wang Yinxi said firmly to him.
	Yang Hanying's eyes lit up as soon as he heard this, and he couldn't help but exclaim with joy:
	"If I'm approved to be a Communist Party member, it's glorious even if I die...!"
	Suddenly, the squad leader's command came from behind:
	"Attention, keep quiet, spread out!"
	Yang Hanying suppressed his unfinished excitement and hope. The team moved silently and nimbly towards the edge of the village.
	A breached courtyard wall was being heavily blockaded by enemy machine guns. The platoon leader urged:
	"Ninth squad! Charge!"
	As soon as the first group rushed to the wall opening, two men were hit. Yang Hanying was quick, and a bullet grazed his ear. He leaned against the right side of the opening, stomping his feet in anger. Then, he bent over and charged out. Wang Yinxi was about to follow, but another burst of enemy fire came. Yang Hanying was shot down five or six meters from the wall. He struggled to get up. His left hand held his rifle, and his right hand still held the grenade as he crawled forward. But, he was bleeding too much, and his bullet-riddled thigh was too weak to push him forward.
	"Yang Hanying, move closer to the wall and take cover, we'll carry you over. Don't worry," the squad leader said kindly to comfort him.
	"Don't worry about me, squad leader, hurry up and charge! I'll rest for a bit, and I can still go with you to complete the mission," Yang Hanying replied resolutely.
	During the second charge, the squad leader, who was in the lead, was also grazed in the left arm by a bullet. He calmed himself down and immediately turned back to direct the comrades behind him to spread out against the wall. He then discussed with the platoon leader about shifting the direction of the attack.
	"Yang Hanying, Yang Hanying!" the soldiers called out to the wall.
	There was no sound from Yang Hanying. Wang Yinxi, using the dim light of dawn, looked out from the wall opening and said sadly to everyone:
	"Old Yang is finished. He's got another hole in his head, I'm afraid he's gone."
	The squad leader suppressed his grief and ordered Wang Yinxi, "Just stay here and keep watch, get your grenades ready, and find a chance to bring Yang Hanying back."
	"Report to the squad leader, report to the comrades, I will complete this mission even if I die," Wang Yinxi said.
	At this time, it was discovered that the squad leader's shoulder was soaked in blood. The deputy squad leader and comrades urged him to go down and get his wound treated, but he refused no matter what. He just used a few handkerchiefs to tightly wrap the wound and quickly led the team away.
	Wang Yinxi squatted on one side of the wall opening, looking at Yang Hanying whenever he had a chance. He thought about how this liberated comrade had taught him how to shoot, and taught all the combat techniques he had learned from the Kuomintang army to the comrades in the squad... Such a good comrade, just a few hours ago, had challenged him, just a few tens of minutes ago, had thrown grenades at the enemy with him, and charged forward shouting battle cries. Just a few minutes ago, he endured the pain and declared his determination to complete the mission, but now he was lying there stiff, unable to pick up his weapons again.
	The enemy's machine gun fell silent at this moment. Wang Yinxi immediately suppressed the flood of memories in his mind to prepare for the current task, to commemorate and repay the dead. He crawled down, poked his head out of the earthen wall, and slowly used the tip of his bayonet to move Yang Hanying's rifle. The gun finally reached Wang Yinxi's hand from two meters away. Wang Yinxi grabbed it, and his hand was immediately stained red with blood. The fire of hatred burned his grieving heart. He gritted his teeth, slung the bloody gun on his back, and charged out in anger. At this time, friendly neighboring forces were fiercely firing at the enemy not far away on the right flank. Wang Yinxi, using his usual left hand, held a grenade, ready to risk his life to carry Yang Hanying back. Unexpectedly, the enemy thought it was an assault force charging up, and shouted anxiously, "Don't shoot, don't shoot, we surrender!"
	Wang Yinxi and his comrades charged up together, and he and the squad leader personally carried Yang Hanying back. The comrades in the squad tightly surrounded him, lowering their heads to mourn him. Wang Yinxi kept straightening his military cap and smoothing out his clothes, thinking about what he should leave behind from him as a memento, and went to reach into his pocket. As soon as his hand went in, touching a large handful of grenades, Wang Yinxi grabbed the squad leader's hand and said:
	"Squad leader, he won our competition. This is his achievement in fighting the enemy at the cost of his life!"
	The squad leader nodded. Wang Yinxi then told everyone about Yang Hanying's conversation on the way to the starting point. The deputy instructor, standing silently, said responsibly:
	"Our branch will immediately write a report to the superior Party committee, requesting approval to posthumously recognize Comrade Yang Hanying as an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party."

　　突击
    曾克
    黑夜，部队刚刚把工事做好，就接到向敌人突击的命令。
    主攻任务一交了十连九班，没等班长把简单的动员话讲完，解放战士杨汉英，两个手举着两颗手榴弹，指着自己的互助小组长王因喜，挑战似的说：“老王，今晚上要和你这放羊小，左不拉子比个高低。咱们各人都把手榴弹弦装起来，看到底谁打的多？请班长给咱们评判。”
    老实而沉默的农民战士王因喜，笑着应了战。九班长张友福用手拨亮了灯，也向大家表示了决心：
    “大家听好指挥，猛打猛冲的干吧！我要是牺牲挂彩，你们千万不要管我，跟上副班长去完成任务。”
    杨汉英胳膊上挎着一个准备装炸弹的篮子，走在组长的后边。他脑子里这时候想起自己被八十八师抓丁送上火线，在死守单县时受了伤被丢弃在血泊中，反倒是人民解放军的担架抬起了他。这亲身的经历，使他对于死里得生这句话理解得最深刻。他一听着枪炮声，这段记忆就越清晰。伤愈以后，是他自动要求参加人民解放军的。当时，他只有一个简单的思想：报恩和复仇。可是，几个月以来，人民解放军的生活，使他懂得很多新道理。他知道这军队不但是他一个人的救命恩人，而是所有穷苦人的。他亲眼看到，一处地方一被这军队解放，那里的穷苦人就有了吃穿。他班上的弟兄，除了他们解放战士，都是自动参军来的，他们对他说，人民解放军就是他们自己的军队。他也下了决心，要跟这军队干下去。当快接近敌人的时候，他的一桩急盼解决的心事，又冲上心头了。他赶上前一步，扯住小组长的胳膊，边走边问：
    “嗯，我的那个事，中不中呀？”
    “班长说啦，已经和支部谈过，这个仗打下来，就让党委快些给你批。好好干吧！”王因喜肯定的对他说。
    杨汉英一听，眼前直发亮，禁不住狂喜的说：
    “批准我当了共产党员，死了也是光荣的……！”
    突然，从后面传过来班长的口令：
    “注意静肃，散开！”
    杨汉英把没有说完的兴奋和希望都压在心里了。队伍悄声的，机动的往村边运动。
    一堵掏开了的院墙，被敌人的机关枪严密的封锁住了。排长催促着：
    “九班！快往上冲！”
    一组刚涌上墙洞口，就挂彩了两个。杨汉英身子闪的快，子弹从他的耳朵边上擦过去。他侧身贴在洞口的右边，愤怒的跺着脚。接着，他腰一弯，一下就冲去了出。王因喜正要跟出去，敌人一梭子弹又打过来。杨汉英在离墙五、六米达的地方被打倒了。他挣扎着想爬起来。左手搂住枪，右手还举着手榴弹向前爬。但，血流得太多了，他的被子弹穿戳的大腿，软得一点也蹬弹不动。
    “杨汉英，你往墙边上挪动挪动隐蔽一下，我们就背你过来。别着急。”班长亲切的安慰他。
    “不要管我，班长，你们快冲吧！我歇一下，还能跟你们去完成任务。”杨汉英坚决的回答。
    发动第二次冲锋时。冲在前面的班长，左臂也叫子弹擦伤了。他镇定住，立刻回身指挥后面的同志靠墙散开。并和排长商量转移方向突进。
    “杨汉英，杨汉英！”战士们一声声向墙外呼唤。
    听不见杨汉英的一点声息了。王因喜借着黎明的微光，从墙洞里往外一看，他难过的对大家说：
    “老杨完了。头上又穿了个窟窿，怕不中了。”
    班长强抑着沉痛，并命令王因喜说：“你就留在这里监视着吧，把手榴弹准备好，瞅机会就把杨汉英弄回来”。
    “报告班长，报告同志们，我死也要完成这个任务。”王因喜说
    这时，才发现班长的肩头被血浸透了。副班长和同志们劝他下去换换药再上来，他无论如何也不肯。只是用几块手巾，紧紧的把伤口缠住，就很快把队伍带开了。
    王因喜蹲在墙洞的一边，有机会就伸头去看杨汉英。他想着这个解放过来的同志把着手教自己打枪，并且把从国民党军队那里学来的一切作战技术，都教给班里的同志。………这样的好同志，在几点钟以前还和自己提出挑战，几十分钟以前还和自己一齐向敌人摔着手榴弹，一齐喊着杀声冲锋。几分钟以前他忍着疼还宣布完成任务的决心，现在却直挺挺的倒在那儿，再也拿不起他的武器了。
    敌人的机关枪恰在这时沉寂了。王因喜立刻把涌上来的一脑子记忆压回去，来准备进行当前的任务，纪念和报答死者。他爬下来，把头探出了土墙，用刺刀尖慢慢的去拨动杨汉英的步枪。枪从两米达远的地方终于拿到王因喜手里。王因喜抓住它，手立刻被血染红了。仇恨的怒火烧着他悲痛的心。他咬了咬牙，把带血的枪挂在背上，激怒的冲出去了。这时，友邻部队在右翼不远的地方正猛力向敌人射击。王因喜惯用的左手，举着手榴弹，准备拼命也要把杨汉英背回来。不料，敌人却以为是突击部队冲上来，沉不住气的大声吆喝：“不要打啦，不要打啦，我们缴枪！”
    王因喜和同志们一起冲上去，他和班长亲自把杨汉英抬回来。班里的同志紧紧的围着他，低着头吊念他，王因喜不断的去抚正他的军帽，伸展他的衣服，想起应该从他身上留下一些什么做念纪，就去掏他的口袋。手一插弦进，触着一大把手榴弹去王因喜抓住班长的手说：
    “班长，我们两个人的竞赛，他胜利了。这是他拼命杀敌人的成绩！”
    班长点点头。王因喜又把在出发的路上杨汉英的谈话，告诉了大家。默默站立着的副指导员，负责任的说：
    “我们支部立刻给上级党委会写报告，要求批准追认杨汉英同志，为中国共产党优秀的党员。”
