Regarding logistics support work, we must focus on development. The implementation of this principle is just beginning. Based on the materials I have learned about in the Fifth Military Subdistrict, I would like to raise a few issues: (1) The concept of logistics support construction has not yet been grasped by some county and district cadres. For example, a comrade from a station in × county said: "There is no logistics support work now. The cadres at the station have nothing to do. It is better to go to the marginal areas to carry out political offensives!" This shows that he has not yet grasped the spirit of logistics support construction. In fact, when logistics support tasks arrive, the work is busy, and after the laborers leave or return, there are many things to do, such as in-depth inspections of villages to check the burden of manpower and financial expenditures, production mutual assistance, etc. In particular, the current logistics support clearing work is even more in-depth and meticulous. If you work hard, you will never finish everything. (2) Regarding the issue of logistics support and production mutual assistance. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting season, most villages carried out different forms of production mutual assistance, which not only completed the logistics support tasks but also did not delay the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Now that the busy farming season is over, there is a general feeling that mutual assistance in logistics support is not so necessary. But in reality, this is not the case. According to the understanding of Yaotang Village in Heze, out of 108 households, only 28 households do not do business, including 18 households with no productive capacity, 2 households of landlords who fled, 2 households who fled the famine, and 4 households of widows and orphans. The remaining 80 households are engaged in winter sideline production (grinding flour, etc.). Among these 80 households, it is understood that 42 households have to stop doing business as soon as they go on a mission because they only have one labor force; in addition, because they are preparing for logistics support at any time, they cannot go out to do business, which hinders the development of winter sideline production. Many farmers, especially poor peasants, are accustomed to solving their winter grain problems through sideline production such as grinding flour and preparing to get through the spring famine next year. The laborers in Guoyoufang and other villages recently returned from the Longhai Railway and brought back hemp and other items. They also engaged in transportation and other production during their travels, which shows the strong production demands of the peasants. Therefore, organizing production mutual assistance in future logistics support should not only not be relaxed, but also be an important issue in logistics support construction. Last winter, some villages north of the Yellow River had already established such mutual assistance organizations. Only by establishing mutual assistance organizations can laborers work with peace of mind outside and not delay winter sideline production. (3) Regarding the issue of the scope of labor burden, according to the understanding of Yaotang, all men between the ages of 18 and 49 serve in logistics support work, but men between the ages of 50 and 60 and 15 and 18 are not included, so all the logistics support must be borne by young adults. However, in Yaotang Village with 509 people, there are only 56 young adults. According to the general proportion, the number of people aged 50 to 60 and 15 to 18 is similar to the number of young adults. They can do some odd jobs, short trips, reconnaissance, and sending messages. According to the investigation, short trips and large carts account for one-half of the stretcher duty time. Taking Yaotang Village as an example, a total of 1,322 laborers were used for four stretcher duties, while 742 laborers were used for odd jobs and large carts (within 60 days). If the odd jobs and carts are done by the elderly and young, the burden on young adults can be reduced. (4) Regarding ideological education, recently, after the laborers returned from the Longhai Line, they all said that the troops took good care of them, like brothers, and they personally witnessed the victory of our army. We should seize this opportunity and use mass meetings and other methods to carry out propaganda and education work. On the one hand, let them spread the news of victory, and on the other hand, improve their understanding of logistics support. It is an ideological change process for laborers to serve the war from unconsciously unwilling to consciously willing. Seizing typical examples to commend models and improve everyone's understanding is the ideological construction work of logistics support among the masses. This kind of ideological construction is very necessary and is the foundation for long-term support of the front. (Ji-Lu-Yu Branch)

    关于战勤问题的商讨
    文远·于军
    战勤工作要从建设着眼，这一方针的贯彻还在开始，现仅根据在五分区所了解的材料，提出几个问题：（一）关于战勤建设的观念问题，现在还没有为某些县区干部所掌握，如×县兵站的一个同志谈：“现在没有战勤工作，兵站的干部没有事，还不如到边沿区开展政治攻势呢！”这说明了他还没有掌握战勤建设的精神。事实上在战勤任务到来时，工作忙，而且在民工出发或回来后，事情也很多，像深入到村检查人力负担及财粮开支、生产互助等问题，尤其是目前的战勤清理工作，是更深入细致的工作，如果认真工作事情就做不完了。（二）关于战勤与生产互助问题。在秋收种麦时期，多数村庄都进行了不同形式的生产互助，既完成了战勤任务，也没误了秋收种麦，现在农忙过了，对战勤中的互助一般的感到不怎样需要了。而实际上却不是这样，据菏泽姚堂村的了解，一百零八户中，只有二十八户不做生意的，内十八户无生产力、二户逃亡地主、二户逃荒、四户孤寡，其余的八十户都进行冬季副业生产（磨粉等），在这八十户中，据了解有四十二户一出差就得停止做生意，因都是只有一个劳动力；另外因随时为准备战勤，想出去做生意的也不能做，妨碍了冬季副业生产的发展。不少农民尤其是贫农，习惯于从磨粉等副业中解决冬季粮食问题，并准备渡过明年的春荒。郭油房等村的民工，最近从陇海路回来，多数都捎了麻等物品，他们在出差中还进行运输等生产，这表示了农民的强烈生产要求。所以在今后战勤中组织生产互助，不但不能放松，而且是战勤建设中一个重要问题。在去年冬季，黄河以北有些村庄，已经建立过这种互助组织。只有建立起互助组织来，才能使民工在外安心工作，又不误冬季副业生产。（三）关于民力负担面的问题，据在姚堂的了解，在十八岁以上、四十九岁以下的都服务战勤工作，但五十岁到六十岁和十五岁到十八岁的男子，未计算在内，因此一切的战勤都要青壮年担负，可是姚堂五百零九口人中，青壮年只有五十六人。根据一般的比例，五十至六十、十五至十八岁的人数，与青壮年人数是差不多的，一些零活、短差、侦察、送信等，他们是可以做的。据调查，短差与出大车，要占担架差时间的二分之一，拿姚堂村来说，共出担架四次，共用一三二二个民工，而零活和大车用了七四二个民工（六十天内）。如果零活和出车由老少来出，是可以减少青壮年的支差的。（四）关于思想教育问题，最近民工从陇海线回来后，都说部队照顾他们很好，像亲兄弟一样，而且他们亲眼看到我军的胜利。我们应该抓住这一机会，利用群众大会等方式，进行宣传教育工作，一方面让他们传播胜利消息，另一方面提高其对战勤的认识。民工为战争服务，由不自觉不自愿到自觉自愿，是一个思想变化过程，抓住典型例子表扬模范，提高大家的认识，这便是在群众中的战勤思想建设工作。这种思想建设是十分必要的，是长期支前的基础。（冀鲁豫分社）
