Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 24th: Comprehensive news: Over the past year, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's frantic conscription in various places to carry out the anti-people civil war, and the evil acts of arbitrarily extorting and plundering the people under the pretext of conscription, have aroused the public outrage of the broad masses of people in the Chiang-controlled areas, and have become one of the main factors for the increasing expansion of the people's armed uprisings in the Chiang-controlled areas. The people in the Chiang-controlled areas refuse to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek, who betrays the motherland and makes a fortune for the four major families, to carry out the civil war.

As early as January and February this year, the people in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas were forced to "take to the mountains" and defend themselves with arms under the harsh policies of the Chiang bandits. For example, Sichuan Province had already sent millions of conscripts during the Anti-Japanese War, and continued to conscript in the past two years, resulting in the near exhaustion of conscripts. In vast rural areas, there are few men to be seen. In Fengdu, Wanxian and other places, most of the people who go to market, farm, carry sedan chairs, and carry litters are children, the elderly, and women. However, the Chiang bandits are still conscripting heavily in the province. The people of the province have repeatedly requested a postponement of conscription, but were unreasonably rejected by the Chiang bandit authorities, who forcibly ordered that 60,000 people be paid in full within two months according to the original plan, and stepped up conscription in various places. Passing merchants, single pedestrians, students, and sedan chair carriers have become targets. They are pulled during the day and at night, forcing the people to be unable to bear it and had to take risks. In the 103 counties of Sichuan, armed uprisings of the people aroused by conscription and hunger are emerging everywhere. Farmers in the Kunlun Pass area on the border of Nanning, Binyang, Wuming, and Yongchun counties in southern Guangxi also held armed uprisings against conscription and grain collection at the beginning of this year, writing slogans such as "Oppose conscription and grain collection" everywhere. According to a Chiang-controlled area newspaper, most of the people's armed uprisings active in Guangxi are farmers who have no power, no money to escape military service.

Since the summer and autumn of this year, due to the Chiang bandits' promulgation of the evil general mobilization order, further demanding the lives of the people, the people's anti-conscription movement has risen higher. In July and August this year, the people in the villages within the so-called "hundred-mile defense line" near Taiyuan, ruled by the Yan bandit, continuously launched struggles against grain and conscription, starting from individual resistance and gradually developing into organized collective actions. For example, the people of Baiyaitou Village, 40 miles northwest of Taiyuan, held an uprising in July. After confiscating the property of the village chief Yan bandit who plundered the people, they all fled to the Jin-Sui Liberated Area. In Suzhong Nantong Bihua Township, two brothers of a certain family were conscripted. Because no one could support their parents, they begged the township chief several times in vain and were forced to hang themselves. Their old father was so angry that he wanted to kill the township chief, and chopped the township chief to death with a knife, and injured the head of the Jia. In other Baos, incidents of people beating Chiang Kai-shek's conscription personnel have also occurred continuously. In Hengjing Town, Suzhou, more than 200 people severely beat the Chiang bandit's conscription police during the Chiang bandit's conscription period, and closely monitored the local Chiang bandit district office, preventing it from acting. The farmers in Peiweng Township, at the junction of Wanxian, Zhongxian, and Liangshan counties in Sichuan, in addition to rising up in the mountains, the few men who remained in their hometowns were also in groups of three or five, carrying knives and sticks, ready to fight the Chiang bandit conscription personnel at any time. In the past two months, the people's struggle against conscription has become even more intense. Youths from five counties including Nan'an in southeastern Fujian organized a "Conscript Grand Alliance" and automatically armed themselves to resist conscription. The people of Rongxian, Tengxian, and Beiliu counties in Guangxi were also forced to organize the "Democratic Alliance Revolutionary Army" under the tyrannical policies of Chiang Kai-shek's conscription and grain collection, with slogans such as "Oppose conscription, grain collection, and purchases," "Realize democratic independence and peace," and "Down with traitors and fascists," and are gradually growing stronger. According to Chiang-controlled area newspapers, 80% of the people's armed forces active in Zhongshan and Panyu in southern Guangdong were forced out by Chiang Kai-shek's conscription and grain collection.

　　抗拒蒋匪抓丁进行卖国内战
  　蒋区农民起义者日多
  　川滇桂闽民变武装不断壮大
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】综合消息：一年来蒋匪为进行反人民内战在各地疯狂抓丁及借征兵向人民任意敲榨勒索的罪恶行为，已激起蒋管区各地广大人民的公愤，并成为蒋管区民变武装日益扩大的主要因素之一。蒋区人民都拒绝为出卖祖国并为四大家族发财而进行内战的蒋介石当炮灰。
    早在今年一、二月间，蒋管区各地人民，已在蒋匪苛政下纷纷被逼上“梁山”武装自卫，如四川省于抗战中已出丁数百万之多，过去二年中继续抓丁，以致壮丁几近枯竭，广大农村已很少看到男人，在酆都、万县等地，赶场交易、种田、抬滑竿、抬轿子的，多半是小孩子、老人和妇女。但蒋匪仍然在该省大肆抓丁，该省民众曾屡请缓征，均遭蒋匪当局无理拒绝，强令照原订计划限二月内缴足六万名，并在各地加紧抓丁。过路客商、单身行人、学生、轿夫均成为被拉对象。白天拉，黑夜也拉，逼得老百姓忍无可忍，只好挺而走险。全川一百零三县，到处出没着为征兵和饥饿激起的民变武装。广西南部南宁、宾阳、武鸣、永淳各县边境昆仑关一带农民，亦于今年年初举行抗丁抗粮武装起义，到处书写“反对征兵征粮”标语，据蒋区某报称：活跃于广西的民变武装，大多数是无权无势又无钱能逃避兵役的农民。
    今年夏秋以来，由于蒋匪颁布罪恶的总动员令，进一步向人民要命，人民反征兵运动更高涨起来。今年七、八月间，阎匪统治的太原附近所谓“百里防线”以内各村人民连续发动抗粮抗丁斗争，由单人反抗开始，逐渐发展成有组织的集体行动。如太原西北四十里的白崖头村，于七月间全村人民举行起义，于没收阎匪闾长所掠夺人民的财产后，全体逃往晋绥解放区。苏中南通碧华乡某姓两兄弟全被抽走，因无人养活其父母，数次哀求乡保长无效而被逼悬梁自尽，其老父愤不欲生，向保长要命，持刀劈死保长，劈伤甲长。其他各保亦不断发生人民痛打蒋家抽丁人员之事。苏州横泾镇二百余群众曾于蒋匪征兵时期中，痛殴蒋匪抓丁警察，并严密监视当地蒋匪区公署，使其不敢活动。四川万县、忠县、梁山交界处之培文乡农民，除入山起义外，留在家乡之少数男人，亦均三五成群，身带刀棍，随时准备与蒋匪抓丁人员拼命，近两月来人民抗丁斗争更如火如荼。闽东南南安等五县青年组织有“壮丁大同盟”，自动武装起来反抗抓丁。广西容县、藤县、北流等县人民，亦在蒋匪征兵征粮虐政下，被逼组织“民主联盟革命军”，以“反对征兵征粮征购”、“实现民主独立和平”、“打倒汉奸法西斯”等为口号，日渐发展壮大。活动于广东南部中山、番禺各地之人民武装，据蒋区报纸载称，百分之八十都是蒋匪征兵征粮所逼迫出来的。
