Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 5th: TASS, Moscow: Saslavsky published an article in Pravda on the 4th commenting on the French situation, stating: "The French people are now defending the country's independence and glory, and the French reactionaries will not be able to suppress the French people. The hypocritical magic of Washington's loyal running dogs and the intimidation of the de Gaulle faction cannot affect the strikers. Bauregat's actions (referring to the unreasonable search of the Soviet emigrant camp by the French police a few days ago) have made the French reactionaries a laughing stock in the world, but their crazy actions continue. French right-wing newspapers are fabricating so-called 'provocateurs' and 'strange machines' 'from the East.' They say that these imaginary planes, which no one has ever seen, are distributing leaflets calling for strikes. The 'National' newspaper narrates a story, attempting to fabricate that strange 'large and heavy boxes' filled with things were delivered to the Soviet commercial representatives at night. All of these are 'provocations' in the yellow press, and these news stories are crudely fabricated by two types of politicians—monstrous old women and cunning adventurers. Immediately following the stale myth of the 'hand of Moscow' and the newly compiled myth of the 'hand of Belgrade,' comes the action of Moch (referring to the Minister of Interior within the Socialist Party): confiscating Communist newspapers, arresting strikers, and illegally expelling Soviet citizens.... Schuman was so shameless in Parliament as to imply that 'foreigners' were participating in the strike movement. Everyone sees through this trick. Those who have brought France to economic disaster and plunged the French people into hunger are trying to blame their own sins on others. The strike exposed the provocation of Wall Street's (American monopoly capitalists) agents, who are burdened with the task of weakening France in order to shackle it with the chains of the American stock exchange. The French people are breaking this plan to enslave them. Bankrupt politicians are making pathetic and shameful attempts to treat the French people as a flock of sheep that can obey foreign orders. This is the old trick of all shameful bankrupt politicians. What is Moch doing now? They need the imaginary 'hand of Moscow' to cover up the real hand extending from Washington that is directly strangling the French people in front of the French people. In the past, the Russian capitalist Liabasktsky invited interventionists to Russia and threatened to strangle the Russian working people with the 'skinny, bony hand of a starving man.' Now, a skinny, bony hand is extending from overseas to France, and the current French wealthy not only have lost their sense of national dignity but also have lost their sense of shame, and are obsequiously kissing this hand."

　　真理报发表论文评法国政局：
    法人民正保卫国家独立反动派决镇压不了他们
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：萨斯拉夫斯基四日在真理报上撰文评法国局势称：法国人民现在正保卫国家的独立和光荣，法国反动派是镇压不了法国人民的。华盛顿忠实走狗的虚伪魔术和戴高乐派的恐吓，都不能影响罢工者。鲍列加的行动（按即日前法警察无理搜查苏联遣民营），已使法国反动派成为世人的笑料，然而它们的疯狂行动还在继续。法国右翼报纸正在捏造些所谓“从东方”来的“挑拨者”和“怪机”，他们说这些从来没有人见过的幻想出来的飞机散发号召罢工的传单。“国家”报叙述一段故事，企图胡说什么有装满了东西的奇怪的“大而沉重的箱子”在夜晚被送给苏联商务代表。所有这些都是黄色新闻报纸中的“挑拨”者，这些新闻都是由两种牌子的政客——妖诞老妇和狡猾的冒险者——粗制滥造出来的。紧接着“莫斯科之手”的陈腐的神话，以及“贝尔格莱德的手”的新编的神话之后，就来了摩许（按系社会党内长）的行动：没收共产党报纸，逮捕罢工者，以及非法驱逐苏侨……。舒曼在议会里竟无耻到这种程度：暗示有“外国人”参加罢工运动。每个人都看透了这一诡计。那些将法国带到经济灾难中去而且使法国人民陷入饥饿中的人们，企图把他们自己的罪恶归咎别人。罢工揭穿了华尔街（美独占资本家）代理人的挑拨，这些代理人正负有一种任务，使法国衰疲无力，以便使它套上美国交易所的镣铐，法国人民正在打破这种奴役他们的计划。破产政客正在进行可怜而丢脸的企图，想把法国人民当作一群可以听从外国命令的绵羊。这是一切丢脸的破产政客的老套手法。摩许现在怎么办呢？他们需要幻想中的“莫斯科的手”，好在法国人民面前掩盖从华盛顿伸出来直接扼住法国人民咽喉的真实的手。从前，俄国资本家李亚巴斯克次基，曾经把干涉者请到俄国来，并且威胁着要用“饥饿人的骨瘦如柴的手”，把俄国劳动人民扼杀。现在，骨瘦如柴的手正从海外伸到法国，而法国现在的富豪不但丧失了国家的尊严感，而且丧失了羞耻心，卑躬屈膝地吻着这只手了。
