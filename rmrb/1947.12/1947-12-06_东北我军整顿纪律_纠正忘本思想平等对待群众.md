Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 3rd: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army is currently engaged in a widespread discipline rectification movement. Based on the actual situation in the units, the Party Committee of a certain division studied the ideological roots of the errors that occurred and decided that in the process of conducting policy and discipline education, cadres should first conduct self-examination and reflection. Soldiers and other non-combat personnel should be given in-depth education based on the new Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, requiring the entire army to clearly recognize: (1) The landlord's property is obtained by exploiting the masses and should belong to the masses. It should not be taken or used casually, infringing upon the basic interests of the masses. (2) It is not allowed to sell public property, because our army's clothing, food, and all supplies come from the masses. Selling things obtained from the masses is a violation of policy. (3) We must treat the masses with equality, oppose being divorced from the masses, and using the ideology and feelings of the ruling class to handle problems, which violates our army's purpose of liberating the people. When the "Unity" unit conducted discipline inspection, the 7th Company first launched a thorough self-criticism throughout the company. The 2nd Platoon exposed a squad leader for hitting someone and a deputy platoon leader for eating the villagers' radishes and drinking the villagers' wine. After inspection, a certain company has now entered the stage of ideological reflection, correcting the forgetfulness of roots ideology of some comrades who thought that "being a soldier means eating, drinking, and having fun," and the erroneous understanding that "it doesn't matter if you take some of the landlord's things to eat." It has also established plans and agreements to ensure implementation. The "Comprehensive Model Company" of the "Advanced" unit focused on discussing the issue of "how to talk to villagers and borrow things." During the discussion, it was raised: what attitude should be taken when borrowing things from villagers in combat situations? Some comrades advocated being "soft," saying: if the villagers' thinking is not straightened out and they really don't want to lend, then don't use it. Some advocated "soft" begging and "hard" using, saying: regardless of whether they lend or not, using it with a smile does not count as violating discipline. There were also those who advocated being "hard." After a heated debate and watching the opera about the relationship between the army and the people, a forum was held to awaken deep reflection. Comrades who had always advocated being "hard" admitted that their opinions were wrong. After discipline rectification and study, the guard company of a certain unit set up discipline inspection teams in each platoon to check and supervise each other. The company headquarters personnel also implemented a division of labor, with the hygienist checking hygiene, the clerk being responsible for compensation and apologies, and the branch secretary convening meetings with landlords. Every time they arrived at a campsite, they dug toilets, swept the floor, carried water, and turned the mill. When sleeping at night, they slept on the floor below the kang (heated brick bed), letting the villagers sleep on the kang. They were sure to compensate for any damage to the villagers' property, so the relationship between the army and the people was very close.

　　东北我军整顿纪律
    纠正忘本思想平等对待群众
    【新华社东北三日电】东北民主联军各部，目前正普遍进行整顿纪律运动。某师党委会根据部队中实际情况，研讨发生错误的思想根源，并决定各部队在进行政策与纪律教育中，干部应首先进行检讨和反省，对战士及其他非战斗人员应根据新的三大纪律八项注意进行深入教育，要求全军明确认识：（一）地主的东西是剥削群众得来的，应该属于群众，不能随便取用，侵害群众基本利益。（二）不许出卖公物，因我军之衣食及一切供给均来自群众，将向群众要来的东西再卖出去，是违反政策的。（三）要以平等思想对待群众，反对脱离群众及用统治阶级的思想和感情处理问题，违背我军解放人民的目的。“团结”部进行查纪律时，七连首先发动全连彻底检讨，二排揭发了某班长打人和副排长吃了老乡的萝卜，喝了老乡的酒。某连在检查后，现已转入思想反省阶段，纠正了某些同志“当兵就是吃喝玩乐”的忘本思想和“地主的东西随便拿点吃没关系”的错误认识，并订计划、立公约，保证实行。“先进”部的“全面模范连”着重讨论了“怎样和老乡谈话借东西”的问题，在讨论中提出：在战斗情况下向老乡借东西应采取什么态度，有的同志主张动“软”，他们说：如果老乡的思想未打通，实在不借就不用。有的主张“软”搬“硬”用，他们说：管他借不借，嬉皮笑脸的用，就不算犯纪律。也有主张动“硬”的，经过热烈争辩和看了军民关系的歌剧后，再举行座谈，唤起深刻的反省，向来主张动“硬”的同志，都承认自己的意见不对了。某部警卫连，于整纪学习后，每排设纪律检查组，互相检查督促，连部人员并实行分工，卫生员检查卫生，文书负责赔偿道歉，支书召开房东会等，他们每到宿营地就挖厕所，扫地，担水，拉磨，晚上睡觉时，自己睡在炕下，让老乡睡在炕上。损坏老乡的东西，一定负责赔偿，因此军民关系非常密切。
