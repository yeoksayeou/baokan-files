　　Congratulations on the Victory of Yuncheng

　　Our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army's South Jin front-line corps captured Yuncheng in one fell swoop at dawn on December 28th. The good news has spread, and the entire area is jubilant. We extend our heartfelt salute to all the combatants, commanders, militiamen, and civilian laborers who participated in this operation!

　　Yuncheng was an isolated stronghold left by the bandit Chiang in southern Shanxi, and it was fortified with extremely strong fortifications. In November, when our army began to besiege Yuncheng, the bandit Chiang rushed five brigades from the Yu-Shaan battlefield to reinforce and relieve the siege. However, they were severely attacked by our army as soon as they rushed to the mountainous area south of Yuncheng and retreated to Henan. This time, when our army launched a general attack on the city, the bandit Chiang scraped together four or five brigades from southern Shaanxi, western Henan, and Guanzhong and rushed to reinforce it. However, when these reinforcements gathered on the south bank of the Yellow River and feared repeating the previous mistakes, Yuncheng had already been captured by our army, and the reinforcements that had crossed to the north of the river also fled south overnight.

　　Chiang Kai-shek once deceived his subordinates by saying: The People's Liberation Army has few artillery pieces and poor equipment. It is impossible to attack heavily fortified cities. As long as you dare to defend to the death and build more solid fortifications, the People's Liberation Army will have no way to deal with you. The bandit Chiang dreamed of using this to maintain his extremely wavering morale and dying rule. But this self-deception and intimidation of the faint-hearted tactics have been shattered by the brilliant victories of our internal operations corps in successively capturing Yongnian, Yuanshi, Changyuan, and Yuncheng. Especially in the victory of capturing Yuncheng, this is further proved. And our internal corps, based on these victories, will find it easier to remove all the isolated strongholds left by the bandit Chiang in the inland areas of our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region.

　　From the experience of taking Yuncheng, it is proved that the improvement of the combat effectiveness of our internal corps, in addition to peacetime training, must also be tempered in actual combat; only in this way can the real combat effectiveness be improved. In the battle to besiege Yuncheng, because the enemy resisted stubbornly with intense artillery fire and solid fortifications, this forced our combat commanders to strengthen technical training; forced our combat commanders to conduct on-the-spot combat preparations. For example, during our army's siege of Yuncheng, the enemy fired more than 10,000 shells at a very small area in three hours; the fortifications of Yuncheng were originally built by the Japanese invaders, and were later repaired by the bandit Chiang; but this strongly fortified isolated city was finally captured by us.

　　This time, our attacking Yuncheng troops truly implemented learning from war in war, training while fighting, training behind the front lines, and training in one part while fighting in another. Constantly exchanging experiences, assessing casualties, improving technology, and improving tactics, along with a heroic and tenacious fighting style, are the fundamental reasons for victory.

　　All Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu internal corps should universally learn from the example of the Yuncheng combat troops, learn their tenacious fighting spirit, strengthen training, enhance confidence in victory, improve siege technology and continuous combat capabilities, fear no fatigue, fear no difficulties, fear no temporary setbacks, actively and proactively attack the enemy, organize campaigns and battles in an organized and planned manner, and strive to resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate all the remaining isolated strongholds of Chiang bandits within our region within a certain period of time.

### 祝运城之捷

　　祝运城之捷
    我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军晋南前线兵团于十二月二十八日拂晓一举攻克运城，捷报传来，全区欢腾。我们特向参加此次作战的全体战斗员指挥员及民兵民工致以亲切的敬礼！
    运城是蒋贼在晋南残留的孤立据点，筑有极坚固的工事。十一月间当我军开始围攻运城时，蒋贼曾由豫陕战场赶调五个旅增援解围，但刚冲到运城以南山地即遭我军痛击，败退河南，此次又当我军总攻该城之际，蒋贼又分自陕南豫西关中等地拼凑了四五个旅兼程增援，但当这些援兵群集黄河南岸又怕蹈上次覆辙之时，运城已为我军攻克，而渡到河北之援兵亦星夜南遁。
    蒋介石曾欺骗他的部下说：人民解放军炮兵少，装备差，不可能进攻坚固设防的城市，只要你们敢于死守并多筑坚固工事，人民解放军就毫无办法。蒋贼梦想借此来维系其极端动摇的军心和临死的统治，但这种自欺欺人、吓唬心胆脆弱的人们的战法，已在我内线作战兵团先后攻克永年、元氏、长垣和运城诸战役中的辉煌胜利所粉碎。尤其在攻克运城的胜利中，更证明了这一点。而我内线兵团，在这些胜利基础上，将更易于拔除蒋贼残留在我晋冀鲁豫区内地的所有孤立据点。
    从打下运城的经验中，证明我内线兵团战斗力的提高，除平时训练外，还必须在实际的战斗中去锻炼；只有这样，真正的战斗力才能提高。在围攻运城的战斗中，因敌人凭借强烈的炮火和坚固筑城进行顽抗，这样就逼使我们的战指员，不得不加强技术训练；逼使我们的战指员不得不去进行实地的战斗的准备。如我军在围攻运城中，敌军曾在三小时内对我一个极小的地域发射炮弹万发以上；运城的工事原是日寇建筑的，而又为蒋贼所增修的；但这一强固设防的孤城，终于为我攻克了。
    这次我进攻运城部队真正实行了以战教战，边打边练，前面打后面练，这部打那部练，随时交流经验，评定伤亡，提高技术，改进战术，与英勇顽强的战斗作风，是取得胜利的基本原因。
    全晋冀鲁豫内线兵团均应普遍学习运城作战部队的榜样，学习他们顽强战斗的精神，加强训练，提高胜利信心，提高攻坚技术和连续战斗能力，不怕疲劳，不怕困难，不怕暂时的挫折，积极主动的进攻敌人，有组织有计划的组织战役和战斗，争取在一定时期内坚决彻底全部消灭我区境内一切残留之蒋匪孤立据点。
