    [This dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu area is dated the 15th of this month.] To promote the cultural emancipation of farmers, the Wei River Fifth District has established cultural associations in every village, combining learning with production. The method is to organize all kinds of artisans in the village into groups, such as dyeing workshops, flour mills, noodle mills, carpenters, etc., to engage in production while learning. The director of the village cultural association is concurrently the village instructor. Village teachers, literate villagers, and various cadres take turns serving as instructors in each group. A portion of the production profits is used to buy books and subscribe to newspapers. For example, the Shijia Village Library has a total share capital of 54,000 yuan, earning a profit of 20,000 yuan in three months. The village used this profit to buy more than 40 kinds of books and subscribe to two kinds of newspapers and one pictorial magazine. Other village libraries have many books. The masses enthusiastically borrow books or study in the library every day. The library has naturally become a reading room and entertainment room. Each group divides the time according to the convenience of production and learning to avoid congestion in the library and affecting learning. In order to solve the problem of insufficient books in each village, the district has also established a general library and four libraries are established in each joint defense unit. Everyone is most interested in farmers' reading materials and scripts, which can be used for learning and entertainment at the same time. In order to meet the needs of the masses, various villages are now actively procuring various farmers' reading materials and scripts.

    卫河五区
    村村建立文联社
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】为开展农民文化翻身工作，卫河五区村村建立文联社，并使学习和生产结合。办法是全村各种手艺人分别组成小组，如染坊、面坊、粉坊、木匠等，一面进行生产，一面进行学习。村文联主任由村指导员兼任，村教员和村中认字的，及各干部轮流到各组任教员。从生产红利中抽出一部红利买书和订报，如史家村图书馆，全村共入股五万四千元，三个月赚利两万元，该村即用此红利买到四十多种书，订到两种报纸、一种画报，现有八十多种书。其他各村图书馆都有书籍多种，群众每天热热闹闹去借书，或到馆内学习，图书馆自然形成了阅报室及娱乐室，各组按生产学习方便，都把时间划分开了，省得馆内拥挤，影响学习。区里为解决各村书籍不足困难，又成立了总图书馆，又以每联防为单位成立四个图书馆。大家最感兴趣的是农民读物和剧本，可以一面学习一面娱乐。为适合群众要求，现各村又积极置备多种农民读物及剧本。
