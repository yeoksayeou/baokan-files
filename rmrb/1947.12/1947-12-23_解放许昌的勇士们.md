Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu Wan Frontline, 21st: Frontline reporters report on examples of the People's Liberation Army's heroic and resourceful victories over the enemy with fewer troops in the battle to capture Xuchang: The eighth company of a certain regiment, the main attacking force on the west gate of Xuchang, in the dark night of roaring northwest winds and visibility close to zero, crossed the moat which was over ten feet deep and fifty meters wide. Model instructor Li Hua, a first-class combat model, led four demolition soldiers and first blasted a breach in the solid city wall. The follow-up troops immediately bravely followed. Four warriors, Wang Mingjie, Wu Zhixi, Chen Zude, and Song Yuhua, jumped onto the city tower, occupied the first bunker on the city head, and immediately stood firm in this bunker. Using two captured Browning machine guns and over a hundred hand grenades, they smashed the four flanking attacks of the Chiang bandits, who outnumbered us by dozens of times, preventing the enemy from advancing a single step and ensuring the victorious entry of our follow-up troops into the street fighting. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army developed from north to south along the city wall. Xia Denggao, a platoon leader of a certain regiment, led a squad to break through the enemy's gun and artillery fire net on the city wall, successively capturing forty bunkers of the Chiang bandits, defeating the enemy's two counter-attacks, and capturing more than forty Chiang bandits alive, with no casualties in the entire squad. The second squad of the second company of the same regiment even used vivid "battlefield shouting" to make a complete combat company of the enemy obediently lay down their weapons without firing a shot. Similarly, the second squad of the fourth company of a certain regiment, in a day and night of battle, completely annihilated an enemy company and two platoons, captured 130 enemy soldiers alive, and again, the entire squad suffered no casualties.

　　解放许昌的勇士们
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十一日电】前线记者报导攻克许昌之战中，解放军英勇机智以少胜众之范例称：主攻许昌西门的某团第八连健儿，在西北风怒吼、伸手不见五指的黑夜，越过了水深丈余、宽及五十米达的护城河，甲等战斗模范指导员李华率领四个爆炸手，首将坚厚的城墙轰开一道缺口，后续部队当即奋勇跟进，王明杰、吴之习、陈祖德、宋玉华等四勇士跃身登上城楼，占领了城头上第一个碉堡，并立即屹立在这个碉堡里，用缴获的两挺白朗宁机枪及一百多个手榴弹，打烂了数十倍于我之蒋匪的四次夹击，使敌未能前进一步，保证了我后续部队胜利的投入巷战。另部解放军沿城墙上由北向南发展，某团排长夏登高带领一个班在城墙上冲破敌枪炮火网，接连攻下蒋匪四十个地堡，打垮了敌人的两次反冲锋，生俘蒋匪四十余名，全班无一伤亡。该团二连二班更以生动的“战场喊话”使敌人一个完整的战斗连一枪未放即驯服的放下了武器。同样某团四连二班在一昼夜的战斗中，全歼蒋匪一个连及两个班，生擒敌一百三十名，全班亦无一伤亡。
