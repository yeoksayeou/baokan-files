Dainan Village Cooperative
　　Specifically Organizes the Poor to Engage in Production
　　[This newspaper's Zuoquan dispatch] The Dainan Village Cooperative was newly developed last year. Since the masses re-elected the hired poor peasant Feng Mangqiu as the head of the cooperative, after the autumn harvest this year, he investigated the surplus labor of all strata in the village and found that most poor hired households would have difficulty surviving until next spring. He then inspired the masses to organize five small credit cooperatives, controlling more than 1.7 million yuan of funds in the entire village, and organized two transportation teams with 31 donkeys. Transportation solved the difficulties of the poor hired laborers. When the weather turned cold, 32 poor hired households in the village could not change their seasonal clothes. He organized a carrying team headed by the hired poor peasant Zhang Fugui, and the credit cooperative lent them 70,000 yuan in silver dollars. Each trip with the carrying pole earned 50,000 yuan. The cooperative lent 195,000 yuan to carry peach kernels to Xingtai to buy back salt and cotton, earning 200,000 yuan, which solved the cotton clothing problem for 32 households. In order to maximize the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the entire village, with men transporting firewood and collecting fertilizer, and women spinning and engaging in other side occupations, he absorbed the village's local product, sesame seeds, based on each person's skills, and organized an oil mill, both turning local products into finished products and using sesame cakes to accumulate fertilizer. In developing the textile industry, the poor hired women proposed that they had no cotton. Chairman Feng then said, "Our cooperative is responsible for solving the cotton shortage." He immediately organized the sale of peach kernels, hemp skins, melon seeds, etc., to exchange for cotton, exchanging for more than 1,000 jin in total. During this grain transportation, the transportation team leader of the Nan Brigade, the hired poor peasant Yin Sidong, led all the livestock, four mules and fifteen donkeys, to send the counter-offensive grain and carry back return trips, earning a total of 181,000 yuan.

　　大南庄合作社
  　具体组织雇贫生产
    【本报左权讯】大南庄合作社是去年新发展起来的，自经群众改选雇贫冯忙秋任社长后，在今年秋收后，他调查了全村各阶层的耕余情况，发现大部雇贫户很难吃到明春，他便启发群众组织了五个小型信用社，掌握了全村资金一百七十余万元，组织了二个运输队，卅一头毛驴。运输解决雇贫困难。天冷，全村三十二户雇贫换不了季，他便以雇贫张富贵为首，组织了扁担运输队，信用社借给大洋七万，担挑一遭赚洋五万元，合作社借给十九万五千元，捎上桃仁到邢台买回盐、棉花，赚洋二十万元，解决了三十二户棉衣问题。为了发挥全村人物力财力，男人运输打柴集肥，女人纺花及其他副业，他便根据各人技术，吸收村里土产麻籽，组织成油坊，一面将土产变成品，一面用麻饼积肥。在发展纺织上，当时雇贫妇女们提出没花，冯社长接着说：“咱合作社负责解决棉花困难。”当即组织把桃仁、麻皮、瓜籽等出卖换回棉花，共换回一千余斤。在这次运粮时，南大队运输队长雇贫尹四冬带领全部牲口骡四头、驴十五头，送去反攻粮驼回回脚，共赚洋十八万一千元。
