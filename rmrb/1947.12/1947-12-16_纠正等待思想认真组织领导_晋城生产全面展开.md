    【This newspaper, Taiyue, 14th】According to Wang Weizhuang of the Jincheng County Party Committee, the winter production in Jincheng has now broken through various ideological obstacles and has begun to fully unfold. In the beginning, there was a mechanical waiting mentality from top to bottom throughout the county, and even the county leaders' arrangements for winter production were simple and perfunctory. Also, because Jincheng is an iron industry area, many cadres and the masses harbored another thought: "Black work doesn't move, white work is useless" (black work refers to the iron industry). Until the District Party Committee issued a call, the leadership first consciously corrected the waiting mentality and paid attention to solving the difficulties of poor hired laborers. Subsequently, the idea of "black work doesn't move, white work is useless" was corrected: 1. Mass meetings were generally held in the first and fifth districts to deeply discuss "black work doesn't move", and whether white work is also useless? By calculating the annual harvest and expenses, the threat of famine was discovered. For example, in villages in the third district with good harvests, the average person had seven *dou* of grain, while those with bad harvests had only four *dou*. 2. Everyone realized that it would be difficult to survive without engaging in winter production, and even the great famine of 1932 would return. Because the second district had a better harvest, they said, "We are not afraid!" This was also corrected. The leadership then put forward the policy of "do whatever can be done," but because there were difficulties in hiring the poor, another idea of waiting for loans arose, believing that there were too many difficulties to solve. The leadership conducted persuasion and solved some specific problems, such as the trade company organizing 1,000 carts for transportation and a loan of 10 million, so the leaders of each district immediately conducted leadership organization according to the policy of doing whatever can be done. Chen Fengyi, secretary of the Fourth District Committee, personally led the masses to carry coal; Li Jianlin, secretary of the Third District Committee, personally supervised the organization, especially regularly checking the leadership situation in various villages. Other districts also organized various sideline productions according to local conditions. The first district boiled saltpeter and transported it, the second district had fifteen village factories doing odd jobs, and the remaining villages transported goods. In the fifth district, in addition to vigorously organizing long-distance and short-distance transportation, they went down to coal mines and opened iron furnaces. The sixth district carried coal, and the seventh district mainly engaged in weaving. In addition, there was also boiling yellow dye. At present, the leadership is further emphasizing solving the difficulties of poor hired laborers and organizing the poor hired to transport goods, so the 1,000 carts organized by the trade company and the 10 million loan are all given to the poor hired laborers.

    纠正等待思想认真组织领导
    晋城生产全面展开
    【本报太岳十四日电】据晋城县委王维庄谈：晋城冬季生产现已冲破多种思想障碍，开始全面展开。在最初，全县自上而下的存在着机械的等待思想，连县领导上布置冬季生产时，也简单潦草。又因晋城是铁业区，不少干部与群众中酝酿着另一种思想，便是：黑行不动白行无用（黑行指铁业）。直至区党委号召发出后，首先领导上自觉的纠正了等待思想，并注意解决雇贫困难。继即纠正“黑行不动白行无用”的思想：一、五等区普遍的召开大会，深入讨论“黑行不动”，白行是否也无用？并以算年成算开支等办法，发现了饥荒的威胁。如三区收成好的村子，平均每人有七斗粮食，坏的仅有四斗。二、大家认识了不闹冬季生产已难活下去，甚至三十二年的大灾荒就会重来。二区因为收成较好，他们说：“我们还不怕！”也给予纠正。领导上随即提出：“能搞什么就搞什么”的方针，但因雇贫有困难，又发生另一种等待贷款思想，认为困难太多了，无法解决。领导上又进行了说服，并解决了一些具体问题，如由贸易公司组织一千辆大车运输，及一千万贷款，于是各区领导上随即根据能搞什么就搞什么的方针，进行领导组织。四区分委书记陈风仪，亲自带领群众担炭；三区分委书记李健林，亲自督促组织，尤其是经常检查各村领导情形。其他各区，亦根据当地具体条件，组织各种副业生产，一区熬硝、运输，二区十五个村工厂做小工，其余村庄运输，五区除大力组织长短运输外，并下煤窑，开铁炉，六区担炭，七区主要纺织。此外，还有熬黄颜色的。目前领导上更强调解决雇贫困难，组织雇贫运输，所以贸易公司所组织的一千辆大车运输与一千万元贷款，均交给雇贫。
