    Zhaobao Poor Women Say:
    “Our skills are poor and we lack capital,
    we're afraid people won't want to help each other.”
    [Report from our newspaper in Zanhuang] On the 28th of last month, the county committee convened a meeting of the heads of the county cooperative, bank, and women's federation to discuss textile work. First, the current textile situation was analyzed, and it was believed that most of the current textile groups were composed of those with more capital, labor, and stronger skills, with "soldier against soldier, general against general" being the norm. Very few of the truly labor-lacking poor and hired laborers have been organized. For example, a poor hired woman named ×× from Zhaobao said: "I really want to help each other with others, but I don't have the capital and I don't spin well, and I have children, I'm afraid people won't be willing." Based on this situation, it is necessary to further mobilize the poor and hired laborers, and organize them by relying on the poor and hired laborers to unite the middle peasants. In order to solve the difficulties of textile capital, mobilize the poor and hired laborers to check loans, and rely on the poor and hired laborers to take control of the distribution. Use it centrally and strongly support the disaster areas. Furthermore, the local cloth in this county used to be sold in Xiyang, Pingding and other counties. Now, due to the development of textiles in these areas, the local cloth market in this county has shrunk. The weaving women reflect: "What should we do if we can't sell the cloth we weave?" Therefore, the leadership must actively find markets. Currently, Qingyuan Store is looking for markets in Meng County in the Jin-Sui area, but it must be 2.7 feet wide, 6.6 feet long, and have fine and even threads to be sold. In the future, the quality of the cloth must be improved. Only in this way can it compete with the cloth from Huolu in the market and consolidate the sales of local cloth in this county for a long time.

    赵堡贫苦妇女说：
    “咱技术差又没本钱
    想互助怕人家不愿”
    【本报赞皇讯】上月二十八日，县委召集县社、银行、妇联主席等开会讨论纺织工作。首先把目前纺织情况做了分析，认为现在纺织组，大部是比较有资本、劳力与技术较强的参加，“兵对兵将对将”的多。真正缺劳力的贫雇，组织起来的还很少。如赵堡贫雇妇女××说：“很想与别人互助，但咱没本钱纺的也不好，又有小孩，说出来怕人家不愿意。”根据这情况，必需进一步深入的发动贫雇，依托贫雇团结中农进行组织。为解决纺织资本困难、发动贫雇检查贷款，依托贫雇掌权分配。集中使用，大力扶持灾区。再、本县土布过去销售于昔阳、平定等县，现因该地纺织发展，使本县土布市场缩小，纺妇反映：“叫俺织布卖不了怎办？”因此领导上须积极设法寻找市场。现由庆元商店，在晋绥区孟县一带找下市场，但必须宽尺二、长两丈、线细匀的才能销售，今后必须提高布质量，只有这样，才能与获鹿布竞争市场，长期巩固本县土布销路。
