　　Northeast Peasants Who Have Been Emancipated Enthusiastically Deliver Grain to Support the Front
　　△ In Andong County, in order to quickly deliver public grain, peasants sun-dried the grain during the day and used heated kang beds to bake it at night. In Tangchi and three other villages, all the grain was dried and put into warehouses within six days, exceeding the planned quota by more than 10,000 jin.
　　△ In Xilin District, Yanji County, grain delivery committees with poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone were generally organized to rush to transport public grain.
　　△ In addition to continuously supporting the front lines, 800,000 jin of grain from the four rural areas of Harbin are sold daily to supply the city's residents.
　　△ In Songjiang, the masses in various places, under the slogan of "Repair roads well to transport grain, support the front lines to win victories," are rising up to repair bridges and roads. In Xinglong Town, Bayan, more than a thousand people flattened a ten-li large puddle into a smooth avenue in one day.
　　△ In the Wuqing border area of eastern Hebei, emancipated peasants transported public grain in carts from ninety li away under the gunfire of the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. Affected by the harassment of puppet gangs in some villages, people were afraid to pull the carts at night when they heard the sound of wheels, so the masses pushed them by manpower.
　　△ Hebei Village in Pinggu County is twenty li away from Sanhe City. The enemy frequently attacked and robbed grain. The emancipated peasants of the whole village transferred grain day and night. Within four days, all 30,000 jin of public grain in the village were delivered to the core area. [Xinhua News Agency Northeast Second Telegram]
