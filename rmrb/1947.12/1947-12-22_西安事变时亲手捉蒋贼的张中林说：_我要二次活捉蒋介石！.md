　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 20th -- Zhang Zhonglin, the platoon leader who personally captured the bandit Chiang Kai-shek alive during the Xi'an Incident, was captured by our forces in the Jinan Campaign in July of this year. After several months of study, he has now voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army. Zhang was a lieutenant deputy platoon leader in the Health Team of the 28th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's Tenth Division. During the Xi'an Incident, he was a lieutenant platoon leader in the Special Service Battalion of Zhang Xueliang's Northeast Army Headquarters and personally captured Chiang Kai-shek alive on Mount Lintong. From his own experience, he deeply realized that there was no future for miscellaneous army officers and was extremely indignant at the fact that he had been demoted from lieutenant to second lieutenant over the past ten years. When joining the People's Liberation Army, he said, "I want to follow my comrades to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive for the second time!"

　　西安事变时亲手捉蒋贼的张中林说：
  　“我要二次活捉蒋介石！”
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十日电】西安事变时亲手活捉蒋匪介石的张中林排长，于今年七月晋南战役中被我俘虏。经数月学习，现已自愿参加解放军。张为蒋匪第十师二十八团卫生队少尉副排长，西安事变时，彼任张学良之东北军总部特务营中尉排长，曾在临潼山上亲手活捉蒋介石。他从其本人的经历深切认识杂牌军官没有出路，对于自己十余年来由中尉反降为少尉一事极为愤慨。参加解放军时，他说：“我要随同志们打到南京去，第二次活捉蒋介石！”
