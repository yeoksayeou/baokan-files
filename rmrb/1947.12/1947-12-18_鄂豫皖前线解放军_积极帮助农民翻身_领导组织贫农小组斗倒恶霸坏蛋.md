Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 14th—During breaks in the war, the various units of the People's Liberation Army actively participated in the mass movement of distributing grain, property, and land, organizing poor peasant groups to help peasants overturn their situation. The "Wujiang" unit, in the Jingfu area, helped the masses distribute the ill-gotten wealth of 32 local tyrants and bullies. In Shacheng District of the county, they helped the peasants promptly arrest Ye Deren, the notorious local tyrant "Fifth Master" who was hated by the local peasants. They distributed all of the tyrant's 200 shi of rice and 300 articles of clothing to the poor peasants, and immediately organized poor peasant groups. A certain regiment of the unit, during half a month of marching, helped the peasants in the areas they were stationed in to organize 18 peasant groups. Another unit, in Guojiawan, Huanggang, convened a mass meeting of eleven villages, overthrowing the bad element and head of the Baojia system, Wang Shenzhi. In total, they convened more than 300 mass meetings in a month, helping the peasants to distribute one million jin of food, 400,000 jin of salt, and thousands of articles of clothing. After the "Huaihe" unit's great victory at Jieling Gaoshanpu, it formed three large work teams and went to the countryside to help the peasants overturn their situation. In the first nine days of November, they helped the peasants in eleven villages in northern Qichun to distribute land. Because the People's Liberation Army wholeheartedly helped the peasants overturn their situation, they won the enthusiastic support of the people. In Xjiawan, Shacheng District, Jingfu, after helping the masses distribute property and grain, many old ladies went to the company to ask to sew cotton clothes for the soldiers.
