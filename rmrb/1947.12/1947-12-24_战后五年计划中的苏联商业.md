　　Soviet Commerce in the Post-War Five-Year Plan
    By Makarova, translated by Li He
    Soviet commerce occupies an important position in our country's economic life. It is tasked with ensuring normal transactions within socialist society, stimulating the growth of industrial and agricultural products, and promoting the improvement of workers' welfare. The development and growth of Soviet commodity trade is the consolidation of socialism. Soviet commerce has no capitalists or speculators. "This is a special kind of commerce, never seen before in history, and only we, the Bolsheviks, can operate it under the conditions of Soviet development" (Stalin).
    Through several Stalin Five-Year Plans, fundamental national transformation, the tremendous growth of commodity production, and the continuous increase in residents' income have led to a significant expansion of Soviet commerce. From 1928 to 1940, the volume of domestic retail commodity trade (at comparable, constant prices) increased 4.6 times. In the years of the Second Five-Year Plan alone, the needs of workers more than doubled.
    The Great Patriotic War required the national economy to guarantee supplies for defeating the enemy. A large proportion of the products of the national economy were transported to the front and not returned in the reproduction process. The products supplied to meet the needs of citizens were greatly reduced. The Soviet people self-sacrificingly shouldered all the burdens of the Great Patriotic War. In order to use the reduced quantity of products more economically, a rationing system was implemented. The basic commercial organizations in the country (state-owned and cooperative) essentially turned to distributing goods according to government-stipulated standards and scope. Trade based on coupons was established. Due to resource constraints, this trade could not keep up with the needs of purchasers among residents, nor could it satisfy these needs. Naturally, therefore, a significant amount of residents' cash flowed to the collective farm markets.
    Compared with the pre-war period, the sharply changed relationship between supply and demand led to a significant increase in prices in the collective farm markets. As a supplementary source of supply for residents and a means of suppressing market prices, state-owned commercial sales were opened. The prices there were determined by the complex interrelationship of considering the quantity of goods on the one hand and the purchasing needs of residents on the other. The selling price was the most important factor in reducing market prices. In wartime, a variety of prices were formed.
    The rationing system implemented at the beginning of the war helped to use national resources most effectively for the purpose of defeating the enemy. It is important to point out that the Soviet state was able to maintain food prices at the pre-war level throughout the war. This was of great significance to the workers, as it alleviated the burdens of the war for them. However, the existence of the rationing system caused a series of real shortcomings in economic life. Therefore, under normal peaceful conditions for the development of the Soviet economy, the rationing system should be abolished.
    In order to abolish the rationing system and transition to unified prices, it is necessary to first increase the quantity of goods in the country. The Five-Year Plan anticipates that industrial and agricultural production will not only return to pre-war levels but will also greatly exceed them. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, agriculture should increase by 27 percent compared to 1940. The production of daily necessities should increase by an average of 17 percent per year. The market fund for the most important industrial goods should increase by 36 percent by the end of the Five-Year Plan compared to 1940. The retail commodity trade volume of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce should increase by 28 percent (at comparable values).
    The first year of the post-war Five-Year Plan has already brought good results in the production of many commodities. For example, the production of consumer goods in all Soviet industries increased by 20 percent in 1946 compared to 1945. The manufacture of cotton fabrics increased by 17 percent, the manufacture of silk fabrics increased by 30 percent, the manufacture of leather shoes increased by 28 percent, the manufacture of socks increased by 48 percent; the production of meat increased by 18 percent, and the production of animal oil increased by 69 percent. With the increase in commodity production, the sale of goods to residents also increased. The retail commodity trade volume in 1946 was 130 percent of that in 1945 (at comparable prices).
    The summary of national economic development in 1946 would have been immeasurably superior if it had not been for the severe drought that affected many regions, which greatly reduced the output of grain, sunflowers, and sugar beets throughout the Soviet Union in 1946 compared to 1945. Such a natural disaster that swept the country immediately after arduous battles created a series of additional serious difficulties for the Soviet people. Naturally, under these conditions, the rationing system could not be abolished in 1946.
    In order to prepare for the abolition of the rationing system and the implementation of unified prices, the state implemented measures to bring high selling prices closer to low rationing prices by continuously reducing selling prices and increasing rationing prices. The new state retail prices for ordinary food will then be determined on the basis of unified prices when the rationing system is abolished.

    In expanding the quantity of products and creating the conditions necessary for the abolition of the rationing system, state-owned and cooperative commercial organizations themselves should play a huge role. Well-organized commerce can not only fully and rationally utilize all the goods produced in the most remote regions and corners of our vast country, but also stimulate the continued expansion of commodity production.
    In this regard, consumer cooperatives play a huge role, as they have a widely distributed and well-prepared trade network in rural areas. The unsatisfactory work of cooperatives has resulted in some agricultural products from collective farms and farmers far from urban markets not being sold. This has hindered these products from flowing into the hands of urban residents. In order to increase commodity trade and improve the supply to residents, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed the "Decision on Developing Urban and Rural Cooperative Trade with Food and Industrial Goods and on Expanding the Production of Food and Daily Necessities by Cooperative Enterprises" on November 9, 1946. This decision formed a supplementary stimulus for collective farms in increasing commodity production. Cooperatives have the right to collect agricultural products at market prices.
    Now cooperatives have all the conditions to thoroughly utilize the surplus goods after fulfilling national obligations. Lenin's instructions to cooperative personnel twenty-five years ago are still alive and meaningful to cooperatives. When Lenin congratulated the Congress of the Central Union of Federal Consumer Cooperatives, he wrote: "The success of the work of cooperative members depends on being good at gathering scattered prices to create new prices."
    In 1947, consumer cooperatives should purchase 6.5 million poods (each pood equals 75 pounds) of potatoes and vegetables, as well as large quantities of meat, milk, and dairy products in the countryside and sell them to urban residents. Experience has proven that under the management of consumer cooperatives, it is possible to successfully utilize the different prices in various regions to unify the prices of large quantities of agricultural products.

　　战后五年计划中的苏联商业
    马卡洛娃作  李何译
    苏维埃商业在我国经济生活中占着重要地位。它负有使命保证社会主义社会内的正常交易，刺激工业和农业产品的增长，并且促使劳动者福利的提高。苏维埃商品贸易的发展与增长就是社会主义的巩固。苏维埃商业没有资本家和投机商人。“这是特种商业，有史以来没有见过，并且只有我们，布尔什维克，在苏维埃发展的条件下才能够经营它”（斯大林）。
    经过几个斯大林五年计划，国家的根本改造，商品生产的巨大增长，以及居民收入的不断增加，引起了苏维埃商业的显著扩大。从一九二八年到一九四○年期间，国内零售商品贸易额（按比较的、不变的价格）增长了四、六倍。仅在第二次五年计划的年份中，劳动者的需要就增加了二倍以上。
    祖国战争要求国家经济为战胜敌人而保证供给。很大部分国民经济的产品运到前方去，而在再生产过程中没有转回来。供给公民需要的产品大大减少了。苏维埃人民自我牺牲地负起伟大祖国战争的一切重担。为了更经济地使用减少了数量的产品，曾经施行了配给制度。国内基本的商业组织（国家的和合作社的）实质上转向按照政府规定的标准和范围分配商品。曾经建立了按票购物的贸易。这种贸易由于资源的限制赶不上居民中购买者的需要，也满足不了这种需要。自然，因此，居民的不少现款流到集体农庄的市场去。
    与战前时期比较，起了尖锐变化的供求相互关系，导向集体农庄的市场上物价的颇大提高。作为居民供给的补充来源和贬抑市场物价的手段，曾经开辟了国营商业买卖。在那里的价格，是一方面考虑商品数量和另一方面考虑居民购买需要的复杂的相互关系而规定的。售价是减低市价的最重要因素。在战时形成了多种物价。
    在战争开始时就施行的配给制度，帮助了在战胜敌人的目的上，最有效地使用国家资源。指出这一点是重要的，即苏维埃国家在整个战争过程中能够保持口粮价格于以前战前的水平上。这对于职工有巨大意义，因为替他们减轻了战争的重担，然而配给制度的存在引起了在经济生活中一连串实在的缺点。因此在苏维埃经济发展的正常和平条件下，配给制度应当废除。
    为了废除配给制度和转到统一物价，就必须首先增加国内商品的数量。五年计划预期工农业生产不仅恢复到战前水平，而且大大超过它农业到五年计划结束时，比之一九四○年，应当增加百分之二十七。日用必需工业品的生产应当平均每年增加百分之十七。最重要的工业商品的市场基金到五年计划结束时，比之一九四○年增加了百分之三十六。国营商业和合作社商业的零售商品贸易额应当增加百分之二十八（按比较价值）。
    战后五年计划的第一年已经在许多商品生产方面带来了良好的结果。例如，苏联全部工业中消费品的生产，一九四六年较之一九四五年增加了百分之二十。棉织品的制造增加了百分之十七，丝织品的制造增加了百分之三十，皮鞋的制造增加了百分之二十八，袜子的制造增加了百分之四十八；肉类的生产增加了百分之十八，动物油的生产增加百分之六十九。随着商品生产的增加，商品之出售给居民也增加了。一九四六年零售商品贸易额为一九四五年的百分之一三○（按比较价格）。
    一九四六年国民经济发展的总结会优越到不可度量，如果没有遍及许多区域的剧烈旱灾的话，这个旱灾使一九四六年全苏的谷物、向日葵和糖萝卜的产量，较之一九四五年大减。在艰苦战斗之后立即到来的遍及全国的这样天灾，替苏维埃人民造成了一连串添加的严重困难。自然，在这些条件下，配给制度在一九四六年不能够废除。
    为了准备废除配给制度和施行统一物价起见，国家实施了经过继续减低出售价格和提高配给价格来使高的出售价格与低的配给价格相接近的办法。对于平常食品的国家零售新价格，随后将在废除配给制度时统一物价的基础上予以规定。
    　　　★　　　　★　　　　★
    在扩大产品数量和创造为废除配给制度所必需的条件，国家的和合作社的商业组织本身应起巨大的作用。组织得好的商业不仅可以完全和合理地利用我们广大国家内最辽远的区域和角落里所生产的一切物品，而且可以刺激商品生产的继续扩大。
    在这个关系上，消费合作社起着巨大作用，它在农村有分布广阔的准备妥当的贸易网。合作社的不能令人满意的工作使得一部分远离城市市场的集体农庄和庄员的农产品没有卖出去。因此阻碍了这些产品流进城市居民手里。为了增加商品贸易和改善对居民的供给，苏联部长会议于一九四六年十一月九日通过了“关于以食品和工业商品发展城乡合作社贸易和关于由合作社企业扩增食品和日用必需品生产”的决定。这个决定对于在增加商品产量中的集体农庄形成了一种补充的刺激。合作社有权按照市价收集农产品。
    现在合作社有一切条件彻底利用在完成国家义务之后的剩余商品。列宁二十五年前给予合作社人员的指示，至今对于合作社还是活生生的和意义深长的。列宁向联邦消费合作社中央联合会代表大会致贺时写道：“合作社社员的工作的成就取决于善于集合零星的物价而产生新的物价。”
    一九四七年消费合作社应在乡村购进并向城市居民出售六百五十万生丁那（每生丁那等于七十五斤）洋芋和蔬菜，大量的肉、牛奶和奶制食品。经验证明，消费合作社在经营之下，可以顺利地利用各区物价的不同，而使大量农产品物价统一起来。
