    Huixian Cadres Recognize Current Favorable Situation
    Overcome Complacency and Underestimation of the Enemy
    Resolve to Actively Launch Guerrilla Warfare
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 6th dispatch] The main cadres of all districts in Huixian County, after studying the People's Liberation Army's declaration and discussing the overall counter-offensive situation on the 16th of last month, overcame the mentality of quick success, complacency, and waiting, and actively launched independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare to eliminate the remaining enemy strongholds. During the study, it was found that the following ideas were generally present: one was the theory of quick victory, believing that the great counter-offensive was "like the situation when Japan surrendered, a grand and vigorous event," and would defeat Chiang Kai-shek all at once, but in reality, it was not like that, so they felt "not very energetic." The second was the idea of underestimating the enemy, complacency, and panic. For example, some comrades said, "It's a great counter-offensive, but we are still storing grain and preparing for war!" "It's okay, we are fighting the enemy fiercely south of the Yellow River, how can they have time to deal with us!" But after the enemy in Huixian city looted Yanglvchuan, they became a little panicked. Some comrades said, "We have great confidence in the overall situation, but we have some concerns about the present!" The third was the idea of dependence and waiting. Many comrades asked, "Why doesn't the great counter-offensive start from our doorstep first?" Why don't we recover Huixian and Xinxiang, but "go to the Yangtze River to fight first?" After discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that the great counter-offensive was a national one, and the start of the great counter-offensive did not mean the elimination of the Chiang bandits in Huixian. We should actively respond to the task clearly pointed out in the People's Liberation Army's declaration that the army and people of the liberated areas should eliminate the remaining enemy strongholds, so as to cooperate with the great counter-offensive, and only then can we accelerate the overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek. It was also recognized that we should redouble our efforts to carry out all aspects of work, constantly organize new forces, launch independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare, and besiege and attack the enemy for a long time, until finally eliminating the Chiang bandits and local bullies, and recovering Huixian city.

    辉县干部认识目前有利形势
    克服麻痹轻敌思想
    决主动开展游击战
    【本报太行六日电】辉县全县各区主要干部，于上月十六日，经过学习人民解放军宣言与讨论全面反攻形势后，克服了速胜麻痹等待思想，积极展开独立自主的游击战争，肃清敌人残留据点。在学习中发现普遍存在着以下几种思想：一种是速胜论，认为大反攻“就像日本投降时的情形一样，轰轰烈烈”，一下就把蒋介石打垮啦，但实际上不是这样，因此，就觉得“劲头不大”。一是轻敌麻痹和惊慌失措的思想，如有的同志说：“大反攻啦，还藏粮备战哩！”“不要紧吧，咱在黄河以南打得敌人稀哩哗啦，它还顾得上搞咱！”但当辉县城敌人大劫杨闾川之后，就有点慌张，有的同志又这样说：“看大局信心很大，看眼前就有些顾虑！”第三种是依赖等待思想，好些同志提出：“大反攻为啥不先从家门口打起？”不把辉县、新乡收复了，而要“先去长江边去打？”经讨论后，大家一致认识了大反攻是全国性的，大反攻开始不等于消灭了辉县的蒋匪，应积极响应人民解放军宣言所明确指出的解放区军民消灭敌人残留据点的任务，以配合大反攻，才能加速打倒蒋介石。并认识到应加倍努力进行各方面的工作，不断组织新的力量，开展独立自主的游击战争，长期围困打击敌人，直至最后消灭蒋匪土顽，收复辉县城。
