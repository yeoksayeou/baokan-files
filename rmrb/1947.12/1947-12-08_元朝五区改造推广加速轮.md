　　Yuan Dynasty Fifth District Promotion of the Accelerated Spinning Wheel
    [Our newspaper's report from Jinnan, 6th] The Yuan Dynasty Fifth District is promoting the accelerated spinning wheel. The district has opened women's spinning and weaving training classes, teaching the use and modification of accelerated spinning wheels. The results of a five-day trial by ninety-five women have yielded the following experiences in modifying spinning wheels: 1. The spinning wheel shaft should be two feet eight inches long. If the shaft is too long, the arm cannot reach it; if it is too short, the string will be short and the spinning will be heavy. 2. The spinning wheel should be five inches away from the body of the wheel, and the wooden spindle will spin lightly and quickly. 3. The large string should be tight, and the small string should be loose, so that it can turn quickly and lightly. 4. The large wheel should be two and a half inches in diameter, and the small wheel can be five tenths of an inch in diameter. The smaller the small wheel, the faster the spinning string turns. 5. The wheel should be made of willow wood. If the wood is too hard, it will not absorb the spinning string. According to the above methods for modification, an experiment was immediately conducted for two "xiangs" (a period of time, about half a day). An old spinning wheel spun four "liang" (a unit of weight, about 50 grams) of cotton, while the accelerated wheel could spin ten "liang". Such self-modification, doing it themselves, and watching with their own eyes, excited everyone. All the women stated on the spot that they would resolutely mobilize women after returning to the village and teach them to use the "accelerated wheel." At the meeting, each sub-district and village also planned to renovate 60% of the accelerated spinning wheels within two months. After the meeting, Comrade Jia Xiuying, director of the Women's Association of Wenji Village, immediately convened a meeting of young women after returning to the village, explaining the benefits of the fast wheel. The results of each group's experiment showed that on the first day, forty-two young women spun twenty-one "jin" (a unit of weight, about 500 grams) of thread, the next day they spun twenty-five "jin", and the third day it increased to twenty-six "jin". Subsequently, a women's inspection team was established to visit the speed and efficiency of the fast wheel in each household. Many young women actively organized mutual aid groups to use the fast wheel. After returning to the village, the women cadres of Xingxian Village promptly mobilized and linked up six young women from poor peasant backgrounds to learn the accelerated spinning wheel. The two of them taught very patiently, and in three days, all six women learned it. After another five days, they mobilized and linked up forty-five young women to participate in spinning and weaving mutual aid. They organized six spinning and weaving teams, started forty-five accelerated wheels, and spun two hundred "jin" of cotton in five days. They earned 700 yuan per "jin", for a total of 140,000 yuan. Under this influence, all 183 women in the village actively requested to renovate their spinning wheels and participate in spinning and weaving mutual aid.

　　元朝五区改造推广加速轮
    【本报冀南六日电】元朝五区推广加速轮纺花车。该区开办了妇女纺织训练班，教授使用并改造加速轮纺车。九十五名妇女，试验五天结果，创出以下改造纺车的经验：一、纺车挺要有二尺八寸长。如挺太长，胳膊够不着；如太短，弦短了纺着沉。二、纺车轮离车子五寸远，木锭子纺着轻又快。三、大弦要紧，小弦要松，转的才能又快又轻。四、大轮二寸五分大，小轮五分大就行。小轮越小，纺弦转的越快。五、轮要用杨柳木做成。木头硬了，吸不住纺弦。根据以上办法加以改造，当即试验了两晌，旧纺车纺棉四两，加速轮能纺十两。这样自己改造，亲自动手，亲眼观看下，兴奋了大家。各个妇女当场表明回村后坚决动员妇女，教给她们使用“加速轮”。会上各小区各村并计划在两个月内，改造百分之六十的加速轮纺车。会后文集村妇会主任贾秀英同志回村，当即召开了青年妇女会议，说明快速轮的好处。各组试验结果，第一天四十二名青年妇女，就纺了二十一斤线子，第二天又纺了二十五斤，第三天增加到二十六斤。随即又成立了妇女检查团，到各家参观快速轮的速度和效力。很多青年妇女积极组织互助组，使用快速轮。杏现村妇女干部回村后，及时动员串连雇贫成分的六名青年妇女，学习加速轮纺车。她二人很耐心的教，三天的工夫，六名妇女即都学会了。又五天的工夫，即动员串连了四十五名青年妇女参加了纺织互助。她们组织六个纺织小队，开动了四十五辆加速轮，五天中纺棉二百斤。每斤赚洋七百元，共赚十四万元。在这影响下，引起全村一百八十三户妇女都积极的要求改造纺车。参加纺织互助。
