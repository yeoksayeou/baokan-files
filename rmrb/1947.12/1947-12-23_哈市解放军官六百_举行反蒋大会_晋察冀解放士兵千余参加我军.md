Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 21st: Six hundred officers from the Harbin Liberated Army Officer Training Regiment held an anti-Chiang Kai-shek rally on the anniversaries of "December 9th" and "Double Twelfth," denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of dictatorial rule, internal war, and national betrayal. After nearly three months of individual historical reflection and grievances and accusations, the more than six hundred members of the regiment have begun to deeply regret being deceived by Chiang Kai-shek into participating in the civil war. At the rally, the members spoke enthusiastically. Wang Shaoqi, formerly a Kuomintang secret agent with the code name 134, reflected on the bloody facts of Chiang's secret agents harming the people. He said that he was sent to Changchun, Shenyang, and other places to participate in assassinating democratic figures, framing Soviet expatriates, and organizing hooligans to impersonate the Northeast Democratic Allied Army to deceive the masses. Upon hearing this, the entire audience was filled with indignation and shouted in unison: "Fight to Nanjing! Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive! Apologize to the people!" After the meeting, all the members unanimously signed and issued a letter to the Chiang Kai-shek army soldiers, calling on the Chiang Kai-shek army to lay down their weapons and not be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek. From the 17th to the 20th, the regiment also organized a city propaganda team to go to public entertainment venues and various middle schools to accuse Chiang Kai-shek of his crimes based on their personal experiences.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, December 21st: More than 1,000 soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army's Third and Sixteenth Armies, who laid down their weapons in the Qingfengdian and Daqing River breach battles, have automatically joined the People's Liberation Army after three weeks of grievance-airing and root-digging education. The training department of our Ji-Zhong Military Region specially held a meeting in a certain place to warmly welcome them.
