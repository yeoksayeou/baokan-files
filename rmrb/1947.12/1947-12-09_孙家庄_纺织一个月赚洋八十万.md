[Reported from Gaoyi by this newspaper] Since the launch of the hundred-day textile movement in Sunjia Village, due to good ideological mobilization and the active support of the cooperative, 41 new female textile workers have been developed in one month. Including the original female textile workers, this accounts for more than 95% of the women in the village. Among these 41 women, 14 have learned to weave cloth, and most have learned to spin cotton. In one month, they spun a total of 987 jin of cotton, earning 700,800 yuan, and wove 128 zhang and 8 chi of cloth, earning 93,000 yuan. The total earnings from spinning and weaving were 800,000 yuan, which can buy more than 34 shi of grain, enough for 138 people to eat for a month. After this summary, everyone felt that they had not only learned skills but also earned more money. So, everyone excitedly put forward three major action slogans: 1. Compete and challenge with high interest, see which group and which person does the best. 2. Help each other with spinning and weaving, study together to improve quality. 3. Help each other with spinning and weaving at night, save lamp oil and transform lazy people. For example, Zhao Xiaozhi, who was transformed, was praised by the women, who said, "Zhao Xiaozhi was lazy, but after everyone persuaded her, her thinking changed greatly. She learned to weave cloth and spin cotton, spinning and weaving late into the night. After the transformation, she worked harder and spun eight and a half jin of cotton in a month. All the women in the village praised her, and her family also solved many difficulties." (Sunjia Village Correspondent Group, Zhen Sheng, Chuang Hu)

[Reported from Lincheng by this newspaper] Nangou in the Fifth District of Lincheng used to be very unenthusiastic about textile work. During this reorganization of textile production, it was reviewed that the reason for the past lack of enthusiasm was that the objects of struggle had not been purged from the textile organization. After the review, under the leadership of the textile hero Ma Qiuxiang, five textile groups were organized. In addition to spinning and weaving during the day, two groups also collectively spin cotton at night (young women). In order to encourage older women to participate in night spinning, young women proposed that older women participate without taking oil money. Currently, two elderly women, including Gai Rong, have joined night spinning. According to the statistics of 21 people in eight days, they spun 36 jin of cotton and wove 40 jin of cloth. Women in Qiaojia Village in the First District are actively engaged in textile work and have put forward the slogan "Work hard on textiles, earn money to get through the famine year." After the autumn harvest, 17 textile groups were organized, consisting of 104 women. In addition to spinning and weaving during the day, each person can also spin four liang of cotton every night. Zhang Dajie, an elderly woman in her sixties, borrowed 15 liang of cotton when she started spinning. After spinning for a month, she not only returned the principal but also used the profits to buy 80 jin of coal and one liang of cooking oil, solving the problem of eating oil and salt. She now has 4,000 yuan of cotton in savings. Shi Songying, a young woman, earned eight chi of cloth and two dou of grain from a month of spinning and weaving and now has 2,000 yuan of cotton in savings. (Zhen Wen, Er Jun)

[Reported from Pingshun by this newspaper] Wangqu in the Fourth District of Pingshun summarized the year's textile production. The village has 286 female textile workers, who spun a total of 7,657 jin of cotton. The entire village population of all ages is 1,154. This winter, everyone was able to get new clothes, averaging 2.5 zhang of cloth per person. After wearing 4,507 jin, 3,149 jin of cloth and yarn remained. Now, excluding the cost of cotton, each chi is calculated at 320 yuan, totaling 6,348,760 yuan, which can be converted into 105 shi of grain. Textile hero Xie Caiqing said, "In the past, I didn't want to spin and weave because our women's thinking was not clear, and we didn't realize that spinning and weaving is a money-making tree." After this big calculation, the thinking of all the female textile workers in the village was cleared, and a plan for getting rich through textile production this winter was immediately formulated.

    【本报高邑讯】孙家庄百日纺织运动开展以来，由于思想动员好及合作社的积极扶植，一月内纺妇新发展了四十一名，加上旧有的纺妇占全村妇女百分之九十五以上，这四十一名妇女中，十四人学会了织布，大部学会了纺花，一月内共纺花九百八十七斤，可赚大洋七十万零八千元，织布一百廿八丈零八尺，可赚九万三千元，织纺共赚八十万元，能买卅四石多，能够一百卅八人吃一个月。经这样总结后，大家都感到这样又学会了本事，又多赚了钱，于是大家兴奋的提出三大行动口号：一、比赛挑战兴趣高，看看那组那人搞的好。二、互助纺织互助学，大家研究质量高。三、互助纺织夜里干，能省灯油还要改造懒汉。如改造过来的赵小枝，妇女们表扬她说：“赵小枝是懒汉，经过大家把她劝，打通思想大改变，又学织布又纺线，夜晚纺织半夜眠，经过改造加油干，，一月内纺线八斤半，全村妇女都称赞，家里也解决了不少的困难”。（孙家庄通讯组、振声、窗户）
    【本报临城讯】临城五区南沟，过去纺织很不带劲，这次整理纺织时，检讨了过去纺织不起劲的原因是，纺织组织中没有清洗了斗争对象。检讨后即在纺织英雄马秋香的领导下，组织起五个纺织组，除白天纺织以外，还有两个组夜间集体纺花（青年妇女），为吸收老年妇女参加夜间纺织，青年妇女提出了老年妇女参加不拿油钱，现已有改荣等二老年妇女参加了夜间纺织。现据八天二十一人的统计，纺花三十六斤，织布四十斤。又一区乔家庄妇女，积极纺织，提出了“加劲搞纺织，赚钱渡荒年。”收秋后，即组织起十七个纺织组，一百零四个妇女，除白天纺织以外，每晚上每人还能纺花四两。六十余岁的老年妇女张大姐，开始纺花时借了人家十五两花，纺花一月，除还了人家的本以外，所赚的利钱买了八十斤煤、一两煮青，解决了吃油盐钱，现还存四千块钱的花。青年妇女史宋英，纺织一月赚布八尺、谷子二斗，现存二千块钱的花。（振文、二俊）
