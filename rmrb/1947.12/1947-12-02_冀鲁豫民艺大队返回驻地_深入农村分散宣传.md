　　【This Dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu, 30th】The Ji-Lu-Yu Folk Artists Propaganda Troupe, after its first long-distance propaganda practice, departed from its base in Nanfeng on September 27th. Traveling through 43 towns and villages including Nanfeng, Handan City, Wu'an County, She County, and Daming City, they traversed over 1,100 li on foot, returning to their base on November 20th. Along the way, they printed over 50,000 portraits of Chairman Mao for the masses, painted over 100 murals, and held 67 mass meetings of various forms in 53 days, reaching a total audience of over 297,000 people. They received over 30 letters of appreciation from the masses and organizations, as well as慰劳 gifts, soap, and other items. The great love shown by the masses deeply moved and educated all the comrades in the troupe. The troupe is now scheduled to hold a model commendation and summary meeting in December, and will be assigned new tasks to conduct decentralized activities in the countryside, promoting the current central work. This conference will also convene representatives from various painting shops and painting technicians to discuss methods for universally carrying out the printing and promotion of New Year pictures and Spring Festival couplets, planning to thoroughly eliminate the poison of feudal superstition, and to inspect and reward the best-performing painting shops and the most popular painting technicians, so that this year's New Year pictures can penetrate into every peasant family that has stood up.
