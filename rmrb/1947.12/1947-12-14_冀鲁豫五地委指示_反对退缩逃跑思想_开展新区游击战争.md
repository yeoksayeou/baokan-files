    The Fifth CPC Jilu豫 Prefectural Committee issued an instruction on work in the new areas on November 23rd, stating that during the Longhai Offensive, the enthusiastic grain distribution movement among the masses in the new areas laid a favorable foundation for further development of work in the new areas. The future task lies in relying on the masses in the new areas to persist in guerrilla warfare, smash the enemy's attacks, suppress landlords and bad elements, approve retaliatory actions by the grain distribution masses in the new areas, and further enhance the struggle according to the level of awareness of the masses in the new areas, until the land reform is completely completed and the new areas are fully consolidated. The instruction emphatically pointed out that persisting in guerrilla warfare in the new areas is the central link in the current work, calling on cadres in the new areas to be responsible to the masses and to share life and death with the masses in the new areas. 1. Establish the idea of striking root and persisting in the struggle in the new areas, treating the persistence in the new areas in the same way as the persistence in the old areas in the past, and opposing the idea of working with the army or grabbing something in the new areas; 2. Establish the idea of boldly advancing, opening up vast guerrilla areas, and protecting the area in continuous offensives, and opposing the idea of retreating without advancing, or simply defending and being beaten; 3. Establish the idea of boldly relying on the new areas and jointly persisting in the struggle with the masses in the new areas, and opposing the idea of not trusting the masses in the new areas, not daring to persist, and retreating and escaping. Regarding the content of mass work in the future, the instruction proposed: mainly to oppose corruption, oppose local bullies, and pour out grievances against traitors, first opening fire on big landlords, big bullies, and incumbent landlords who collude with the enemy to harm the masses. Finally, it pointed out that the situation in the new areas is different from that in the old areas, and it is necessary to find out the suffering and demands of the masses in the new areas, improve the struggle according to the demands of the masses, and create experience in the struggle from grain distribution to land distribution in the new areas.

    冀鲁豫五地委指示
    反对退缩逃跑思想
    开展新区游击战争
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】五地委于十一月二十三日，颁发新区工作指示，说明陇海出击期间，新区群众热烈的分粮运动，打下了进一步开展新区工作的有利条件。今后的任务，在于依靠新区群众坚持游击战争，打破伪顽进攻，镇压地主坏蛋，批准新区分粮群众的报复行为，并根据新区群众觉悟程度，进一步提高斗争，直至彻底完成土改，把新区完全巩固起来。指示着重指出：坚持新区游击战争，是当前工作的中心一环，号召新区干部对群众负责，与新区群众同生死共患难。一、树立生根立脚坚持新区斗争的思想，把坚持新区和过去坚持老区同样看待，反对随军工作或到新区抓一把的思想；二、树立大胆跃进、开辟广大游击区，在不断进攻中保护地区思想，反对退缩不前，或单纯防御挨打思想；三、树立大胆依靠新区与新区群众共同坚持斗争的思想，反对不相信新区群众、不敢坚持、退缩逃跑思想。关于今后群众工作内容，指示中提出：主要是反贪污、反恶霸、反奸诉苦，首先向大地主大恶霸及勾结敌人残害群众的当权地主开火。最后指出，新区的情况与老区不同，必须摸清新区群众痛苦与要求，根据群众要求提高斗争，创造出新区从分粮到分地的斗争经验。
