　　Shangguan Zhong Has a Mutual Aid Brigade
    Inspect Production Plans to Overcome Waiting Mentality
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 7th dispatch] The Shangguan Zhong Mutual Aid Brigade in Yanshan Village, Yangcheng, discovered the "waiting" mentality hindering winter production by comparing production plans with each other. In mid-November, the Shangguan Zhong Brigade planned to combine participation in the war and review winter production, aiming to ensure that this winter's food and clothing would not rely on this year's grain, but entirely on earning a living through spinning, weaving and transportation. Preparations for next year's spring plowing involved mobilizing households door-to-door, with each family making a plan. However, when comparing the plans, it was found that some people's plans were unrealistic. For example, Shang Maokui's family of five had a mule, but he only planned to earn 20,000 yuan through transportation and 2,200 yuan through spinning and weaving (one mule could earn 20,000-30,000 yuan per trip). After further investigation, it was revealed that many people had a mechanical "waiting" mentality and were not seizing the time for production. After research and discussion, and using various examples to dispel this incorrect thinking, a clear plan was established: men should transport goods four times, women should weave five bolts of cloth, and each person should earn an average of 12,000 yuan, and all the manure for next spring should be carried to the fields. After this meeting, on November 20th, they actively began to work, and by the end of November, they had already achieved great success. In the Lujiahe Eighth Squad alone, in ten days, men earned 170,000 yuan through transportation, and women wove 75 bolts of cloth, earning 220,000 yuan.

　　上官中有互助大队
    检查生产计划克服等待思想
    【本报太岳七日电】阳城岩山村上官中有互助大队，从互相比看生产计划中，检查出阻碍冬季生产的等待思想。十一月中旬，上官中有大队，即计划结合参战复查进行冬季生产，要作到今冬吃穿不动今年粮，全靠纺织运输来过活，并准备明年春耕，即挨门挨户动员，家家订计划。但在互相比看计划的时候，发现有些人的计划不实际，如上马魁全家五口人，还有一个骡子，但他仅计划运输赚洋两万元、纺织赚洋二千二百元（光一头骡子一回就能赚两三万元）。大家深入检查了一下，原来有好些人存在着机械的“等待”思想，不抓紧时间进行生产。经过研究讨论，并以各种实例打通了这种不正确的思想，明确定出了计划：男人要运输四回，女人要纺织五匹布，平均每人要赚洋一万二千元，明春的粪都要担到地里。经过这次会后，十一月二十日就积极行动起来，截至十一月底，已获得了很大成绩，仅芦家河八分队，十天内男人运输即赚洋十七万元，妇女纺织了七十五匹布，赚洋二十二万元。
