Jiaozuo Grain Protection Experience
　　Understanding the Enemy's Situation, Striking First, Continuous Attacks Gain the Upper Hand
　　[This newspaper's Jiaozuo dispatch] Jiaozuo City has initially summarized its half-month experience in the anti-grain-grabbing struggle. The recent characteristics of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime's activities are: small armed groups harassing our hinterland at night, attempting to cause panic among the people, creating chaos in the border areas, and taking the opportunity to plunder grain and conscript soldiers on a large scale. In order to smash the enemy's attempt, we organized the Jiaozuo-Bo'ai-Wuzhi border area joint defense command, divided the joint defense areas, cooperated with the core armed forces, took the initiative to attack the enemy, opened explosives training classes, combined political offensives, and launched an explosives movement. From November 2nd to 16th, in half a month, there were 16 battles of varying sizes, killing, wounding, and capturing 23 grain-grabbing Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime traitors and despots, seizing eight rifles, as well as other bombs, sacks, carrying poles, and some grain. We have also gained the following points of experience: First, organize the border area joint defense of Jiaozuo, Bo'ai, and Wuzhi counties (cities), concentrate forces, unify command, with core armed forces as support, take the initiative to attack, penetrate into the enemy's heartland strongholds, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime black spot villages, and resolutely attack the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime's armed forces that harass and grab grain. In the beginning, strike earlier than the die-hard puppets at night, striving to strike first. On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, the enemy harassed Lingquanpo village for three consecutive nights, but was repelled by the village militia in cooperation with the rotation teams. On the 9th night, the enemy divided into five routes to harass our villages in the first and third districts, but was repelled by our Yang Juhe and Fan Keqing militia rotation teams. A traitor-despot from Beizhang Village returned to the village at night to grab grain, but was repelled by the village militia, injuring one member of the puppet self-defense force and seizing four sacks, three carrying poles, one hand grenade, and over a stone of grain. On the 10th night, the Yang Juhe rotation team, in cooperation with the core armed forces, strongly attacked and captured the Jiahetun stronghold, killing and wounding five members of the puppet self-defense force, capturing six, and seizing eight rifles. After our continuous and resolute attacks on the grain-grabbing Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, the enemy changed to harassing our activities during the day. On the 11th, after breakfast, the Yang Juhe rotation team, in cooperation with the Qinyang rotation team and core armed forces, attacked villages such as Zaodian stronghold, killing one member of the Zaodian self-defense force and capturing two conscripts from Xinzhuang. On the morning of the 12th, the Fan Keqing rotation team, in cooperation with the core armed forces, disguised themselves in plain clothes, tied their guns in corn stalks, and attacked Liuzhuang, wounding five members of the self-defense force. On the morning of the 16th, the Yang Juhe rotation team, in cooperation with a part of the core armed forces, captured three members of Chiang Kai-shek's 38th Division below the rank of adjutant on the Jiaozuo-Bo'ai highway, killing two. In this way, with the support of our core armed forces, the support of the militia from outside counties, and the active attacks of the militia, the enemy had no chance to take advantage of the situation day or night, and was frightened and unable to find a safe place, only busy fleeing for their lives, crushing the enemy's grain-grabbing harassment and stabilizing the masses' morale. Second, open short-term explosives training classes, rotate training of poor peasant and hired peasant militia, and carry out stone mine explosives movement in the plain areas. Use the actual results of the explosives to educate the masses, breaking the fixed idea that stone mine explosives cannot be carried out in the plain areas. For example, the women in Nanzhang Village all make stone mines. Recently, every village has tried them, and everyone has exploded them. An old woman in ×× Village said, "Stones can also hit the enemy, what are we afraid of with this!" Use landmines to attack: The Fan Keqing rotation team buried landmines in the field of Zhao ××, the head of the puppet self-defense force in Shangzhuang Village. When he went to the field to rake the ground, the landmine exploded, damaging his lower abdomen. He said dejectedly, "This is the result of my being the team leader." The rotation team of the third district buried landmines in the home of Ji Yaoliang, the head of the puppet self-defense force in Wu Chu. When Ji's son returned home to pick corn, he detonated the landmine, blinding one of his eyes. Ji Changcun, a big bully in Xinzhuang, went to the puppet self-defense force headquarters, and when he opened the door, his hand was blown off. He said, "The Eighth Route Army is really powerful, I don't know when they will bury all the landmines here." The puppet self-defense force in Fucheng broke its leg while patrolling back to the village. The enemy's small armed groups stepped on landmines for three consecutive nights in Lingquanpo, wounding three. The stronghold villages and villages near the stronghold were blockaded by landmines and became a world of terror. The enemy could not move an inch and could not guarantee their lives. The masses who had been prepared for war and transferred out have returned to the village to organize self-defense, and women and children automatically stand guard at night, insisting on defending their village positions and fighting the enemy. Third, what is equally important with armed attacks on die-hard puppets who grab grain is to carry out political offensives. Along with the armed attacks on villages and strongholds, carry out propaganda to the masses: protect grain and conscripts, and pay anti-offensive grain. Shout at the die-hard puppet troops. When attacking the Jiahetun stronghold, more than 500 copies of the victory reports and propaganda materials were posted on the walls of the streets. In Fucheng Village alone, 30 households and more than 80 people who had been deceived and fled were won back. An old woman in ×× Village asked a certain company commander of Wang Fei (Fengyin)'s unit, "Is it okay for me to send grain and money to both sides?" The company commander hesitated and said, "It's just a matter of confusion, we can't stop it!" Another team member said, "Go and send it! Why ask!" Now there are already eight villages (strongholds and nearby villages) that have paid anti-offensive grain. In ×× Village alone, 30 people come to send anti-offensive grain once a day.

　　焦作护粮经验
  　摸清敌情先下手连续进击占上风
    【本报焦作讯】焦作市初步总结半月反抢粮斗争经验。蒋伪最近活动的特点：夜间小股武装向我腹地出扰，企图使民心恐慌，造成边地的混乱，趁机大肆抢粮抓丁。为纷碎敌人这一企图，我们组织了焦（作）博（爱）武（陟）边地联防指挥部，划分联防，配合基干武装，向敌主动出击，开爆炸训练班，结合政攻，展开爆炸运动。自十一月二日到十六日，半月来大小战斗十六次，毙伤俘抢粮蒋伪奸霸二十三人，缴步枪八枝，及其他炸弹、布袋、扁担、粮食等一部。并获得以下几点经验：一、组织焦、博、武三县（市）边地联防，集中力量，统一指挥，基干武装撑腰，主动出击，深入敌人心脏据点，消灭蒋伪黑点村，顽强打击蒋伪出扰抢粮的武装。开始，夜间比顽伪早出击，争取先下手为强。三、四、五日敌连续三夜向灵泉坡村出扰，均被该村民兵配合轮战队击退，九日夜，敌分五路出扰我一、三区村庄，均被我杨聚和、范克清民兵轮战队击退，北张村奸霸黑夜回村抢粮，被该村民兵击退，打伤伪自卫团一名，缴布袋四条、扁担三条、手榴弹一个、粮食石余。十日夜，杨聚和轮战队配合基干武装，强攻打下嘉禾屯据点，毙伤伪自卫团五名，俘六名，缴枪八枝。经我连续顽强打击抢粮的蒋伪后，敌又改变成白天向我出扰活动。十一日早饭后，杨聚和轮战队配合沁阳轮战队及基干武装，出击造店等据点村，击毙造店自卫团一名，捉回新庄保丁等二名。十二日上午范克清轮战队，配合基干武装，化装便衣，把枪捆在玉茭秆里，出击柳庄，伤自卫团五名。十六日上午，杨聚和轮战队配合基干武装一部，于焦、博公路上俘蒋匪军卅八师副官以下三名，击毙二名。这样在我基干武装撑腰，外县民兵支援，民兵主动出击下，使敌人夜间白天都无机可乘，吓的心惊胆跳，找不到保险地，只忙于逃命，粉碎了敌人的抢粮出扰，也安定了群众情绪。二、开办短期爆炸训练班，轮训贫雇民兵，开展平原地区的石雷爆炸运动。用实际收到的爆炸成绩教育群众，打破过去对平原地区不能开展石雷爆炸的固定想法。如南张村妇女都打石雷。最近村村试放，个个爆炸，××村一个老太太说：“石头还能打敌人，有这还怕啥！”用地雷出击：范克清轮战队，把地雷埋在上庄村伪自卫团长赵××地里，他到地里耙地时，地雷响了，炸坏他的小腹，他丧气地说：“这是我当队长的结果。”三区轮战队把地雷埋到五褚伪自卫团长姬要良家，姬的儿回家提玉茭，带响了地雷，炸瞎了一只眼睛。新庄大恶霸姬长存到伪自卫团团部，一开门炸坏了他的手，他说：“八路军真厉害，不知啥时把这里都埋成雷。”府城伪自卫团回村放哨炸坏了腿。敌小股武装一连三夜到灵泉坡，都踏响地雷，炸伤三个。据点村和据点附近村庄被地雷封锁的成了恐怖世界，敌人寸步难行，坐立不保性命。以前备战转移出的群众，都回村组织自卫，妇女儿童夜间都自动站岗放哨，坚持本村阵地，对敌斗争。三、与武装打击顽伪抢粮并重的是开展政攻。随着武装出击到的村庄据点，向群众进行宣传：保粮保丁，缴纳反攻粮。向顽伪军进行喊话。打进嘉禾屯据点时，五百多份捷报宣传品贴到大街的墙上，仅府城一村即争取回受骗逃亡的群众三十来户八十多口人，××村一个老太太问王匪（凤银）部某连长：“俺两头送粮款准不准？”该连长吞吐半天才说：“胡理胡涂就这会事情吧，咱挡不住呀！”另一个队员说：“去送吧！还用问！”现在已有八个村（据点和附近村）缴纳反攻粮，仅××一村一天一次即有三十来个群众来送反攻粮。（王汝珍、连志中）
