Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: Belated News: The Anlan Conference convened by the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau opened on the 25th of last month in Bin County, Bohai District. The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and various military and government organs in East China sent congratulatory messages to the conference, praising the great achievements of the people in harnessing the Yellow River. More than a hundred people, including River Affairs Bureau officials and representatives of county-selected heroes of Yellow River management, participated in the conference. After announcing the year's achievements in Yellow River management, the conference awarded prizes to the heroes and paid tribute to the martyrs who died in Yellow River management.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: The Shandong River Affairs Bureau recently announced the year's achievements in Yellow River management in the region at the Bohai Anlan Conference. It was reported that on March 24th this year, the Chiang bandits violated the agreement and released water, and the turbulent flow poured into the Yellow River in the Bohai Sea, causing 43 dangerous points in the six hundred-mile riverbed. While tensely supporting the self-defense war, the people of our region were forced to rise up and save themselves, fighting against the Yellow River. Every day, 100,000 to 200,000 civilian workers along the river were rushing to repair the dikes. When the flood arrived, dangerous works in various places were in danger at the same time. Chiang's planes bombed the dikes day and night. The dangerous points in Damajia, Wangjiazhuang, and Qijiazui in the jurisdiction of Lijin County were in imminent danger. Fortunately, tens of thousands of people worked together and desperately repaired them in the wind and rain for more than ten days and nights, and danger was turned into safety. At that time, the efficiency of civilian workers increased by an average of one time, from 1.5 cubic meters of earth per day to 3 cubic meters of earth. In total, (excluding the statistics of two counties) a total of 3,719,156 people were mobilized throughout the year, and 477,485 civilian workers participated. 70,704 cubic meters of earth and stone, 14,712,778 catties of straw, 44,448 wooden stakes, and 10,468 hemp ropes were used. The total value of materials alone reached 302.6 million yuan in Beihai currency (each yuan is about 20 yuan in Chiang currency). The wages and grain paid by the government reached 12,792,069 catties, and the horse grass and firewood reached 6 million catties. Medical and compensation expenses totaled more than 6.79 million yuan. A total of 3,074,930 catties of relief grain were distributed before and after, and 43,404 people were relieved. The number of large and small vehicles mobilized, according to the statistics of Bin County and other three counties alone, was more than 23,000. Due to Chiang and the US's violation of the agreement to release water ahead of schedule, the people along the river suffered heavy losses. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 111 villages were submerged, 22,908 houses, and 263,514 mu of cultivated land. Under Chiang's bombing, 894 of our employees and people were killed and injured, more than 300 houses were destroyed, 57 boats, and 39 sections of dams. The loss of materials due to the harassment and destruction of Chiang's bandits is even more alarming. In Qingcheng Mazhazi alone, 3,000 meters of river embankment were destroyed, and 201,801 catties of public grain were robbed. Other destroyed materials included: 30,000 sacks, 1.6 million catties of straw, more than 2,000 catties of lead wire, and more than 1,200 reed mats.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: Belated News: The Yellow River winter flood prevention project in Kenli (newly established county east of Lijin) County District started on the 5th of last month and was completed on the 13th. The total length of the repaired dikes was 25,151 meters, the earthwork reached more than 4.17 million cubic meters, and more than 2 million civilian workers were mobilized. The project was originally planned to be completed in half a month. Because the efficiency of civilian workers increased from 3 cubic meters of earth per person per day to 4.5 cubic meters, it was completed ahead of schedule. A large number of model civilian workers and seven model villages emerged in the project.

    渤海举行安澜大会
    垦利完成黄河冬防
    【新华社华东十三日电】迟到消息：山东省河务局召开之安澜大会，于上月二十五日在渤海区滨县揭幕，中共中央华东局及华东各军政机关，均电大会庆贺人民治黄之丰功伟绩。参加大会者为河务局及各县选出之治黄功臣百余人。大会于公布全年治黄成绩后，即向治黄功臣给奖，并追悼治黄死难烈士。
    【新华社华东十三日电】山东河务局顷在渤海安澜大会上，公布该区全年治黄成绩。略称：今年三月二十四日，蒋匪违约放水，滚滚浊流即注入渤海涕河，造成六百里河床四十三处险工的横祸。我区人民一面紧张支援自卫战争，一面被迫起而自救，与黄水斗争。沿河每日均有民工十万至二十万人，抢险复堤。伏泛到来，各地险工同时告急，蒋机则昼夜沿堤轰炸，利津县属之大马家、王家庄、綦家嘴等处险工，千钧一发。幸赖数万群众同心合力在风雨中拼命抢修十余昼夜，始得化险为夷。当时民工效率平均提高一倍，由每日一方半土，提高到三方土。总计全年（缺两县统计）共动用人工三、七一九、一五六人，参加民工达四七七、四八五人。用土、石七○、七○四方，秸料一四、七一二、七七八斤，木桩四四、四四八条，麻绳一○、四六八条。仅物料一项，总值达北海币三十万万二千六百余万元（每元约合蒋币二十元）。政府付出之工资粮，达一二、七九二、○六九斤，马草烧柴达六百万斤。医药抚恤等费共六百七十九万余元。前后发救济粮三、○七四、九三○斤，获得救济者四三、四○四人，动员之大小车辆，仅滨县等三县统计，为二万三千余辆，由于蒋美违约提前放水，沿河人民损失惨重，不完全统计：共淹没村庄一百十一处，房二万二千九百零八间，耕地二十六万三千五百一十四亩。蒋机轰炸下，我员工人民伤亡八百九十四人，炸毁房三百余间，船五十七只，埽坝三十九段。蒋匪骚扰破坏损失之工料，更属惊人。仅青城马扎子被毁河堤三千公尺，公粮被抢二○一、八○一斤，其他被毁物料计有：麻袋三万条，秸料一百六十万斤，铅丝二千余斤，苇席一千二百余条。
    【新华社华东十五日电】迟到消息：山东垦利（利津东之新设县）县区之黄河冬防工程，于上月五日开始，历十三日全部完成。此次补修之大堤达两万五千一百五十一公尺，土工达四百十七万余方，动用民工二百余万，工程原计半月完成，由于民工效率由每日每人三方土提高至四方半，故得提前完成。工程中涌现大批模范民工与七个模范村。
