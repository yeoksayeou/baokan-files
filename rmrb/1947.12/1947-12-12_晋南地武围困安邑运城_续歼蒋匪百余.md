    Taiyue Telegraph, December 10th: The Jinan local armed forces have continued to eliminate 150 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops on the outskirts of Anyi and Yuncheng. The Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops trapped in the above two locations are extremely panicked and struggling desperately, but they are all being met with annihilating blows. On the evening of the 4th, a unit of our army raided an outer stronghold in the northern suburbs of Yuncheng, completely eliminating a platoon of the enemy Lei Wenqing's troops and the exiled Yi's "Security Police Force," killing and wounding 36 and capturing 46 alive, seizing 40 rifles, 4 light machine guns, one grenade launcher, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Four members of the Yi's "Security Police Force" surrendered to our side with three rifles. On the 6th, we ambushed the Yan Xishan bandit Anyi "Security Police Force" from Dongwang and Sanjia Village north of Anyi. After one hour of combat, all 700 plus enemies were routed by us, with over 30 killed and wounded and 19 captured alive, seizing 13 rifles and 2,000 rounds of ammunition.
