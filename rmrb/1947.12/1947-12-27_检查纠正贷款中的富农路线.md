　　Checking and Correcting the Rich Peasant Line in Loans
    Taihang Administrative Office Construction Department
    Since the autumn harvest, our region has successively issued 550 million yuan in relief and winter production loans, and 2 million catties of relief grain. The purpose is to support hired and poor farmers in their production and to overcome the difficulties of a poor harvest. However, due to our unclear class ideology, many serious deviations that urgently need to be corrected have occurred in the loan work, and the most prominent of these is the rich peasant line in the loans.
    The credit cooperative in Sucun, Cixian County, lent out 200,000 yuan, most of which went to households with carts and livestock, while hired and poor people with no capital or tools were ignored. The hired and poor farmer Bao Fuyin organized five people to go to Linxian to sell goods, but they could not do so due to lack of capital. The first loan in Naozi Village was 180,000 yuan, which was lent to middle peasants with carts and livestock. Hired and poor people wanted to borrow money to buy production tools, but they were not given loans because they did not meet the so-called "transportation conditions." Some villages also did not organize hired and poor people to find production avenues, so that hired and poor people did not dare to borrow money or were forced to sell grain as capital. As Li Junlou's mother from Wangzhuang, Pingshun said: "There is no capital for production, so we can only sell grain. We want to borrow money but there is no way to produce, so we are afraid we cannot repay it and dare not borrow." In Heisha Village, Lincheng, each of the twelve middle peasant households received an average loan of more than 16,000 yuan, but each of the fifteen hired and poor households received only an average loan of more than 5,000 yuan, which was half that of the middle peasants.
    Even more erroneous is that some not only did not support the hired and poor, but instead lent money to landlords who had been struggled against. For example, Heisha Village in Lincheng gave a loan of 20,000 yuan to four struggle targets. Although some villages have conducted inspections and calculated the distribution, the inspections are still extremely shallow, and the concepts are still very vague. We require all localities to not simply calculate the percentage of households and amounts of money when conducting inspections, but also to calculate the average number of households and people, and more importantly, to clarify that the basic purpose of our loans is to support the hired and poor, not others.
    The cooperative line that was previously advocated in loans is actually also a kind of rich peasant line. This is because many cooperatives take the loans themselves for speculative production. For example, in Shangyang Village, Heshun, which has been inspected, a total of 300,000 yuan was borrowed, and the cooperative actually took it all to Xingtai for speculative trading. This phenomenon has also occurred in some villages in Changzhi. They said: "The cooperative earns money for the masses." It sounds reasonable, but in fact, many cooperatives have not yet been transformed, the hired and poor have not yet taken power, and the capital of middle peasants and above still occupies a dominant position. Even if they earn some money, the hired and poor will not get much benefit.
    The Fifth Special Commissioner's Office and the Wu'an Sub-branch once made such a decision: "Old loans in areas with cooperatives should all be transferred to cooperatives to support the establishment of credit business; new loans in areas with cooperatives should all be made through cooperatives, and in areas without cooperatives, cooperatives should be established through loans." As a result of this approach, in addition to still taking the rich peasant line, the purpose of the loan is also very vague. It is clear that the purpose is not to support the production of the hired and poor through loans, but to regard loans as a means of developing cooperatives.
    We believe that before cooperatives are universally transformed, we should not emphasize going through cooperatives, but should organize loan review committees of the hired and poor in each village, and all loans should be decided by the hired and poor and directly issued to the masses. The old loan part should be re-examined by the hired and poor for clearance and re-lending. Cooperatives can only share the work of managing funds and accounts, but have no power to decide on issuance. The establishment of credit business should mainly be based on concentrating the floating capital of the masses.
    The various malpractices in the loan work are closely related to the composition and style of the village-level organizations. Because the composition of some village cadres is impure and their style is incorrect, loans often either become private property or are lent inappropriately when they pass through them, and some are even lent to struggle targets. For example, Wei Zhaosheng, the head of Huangnian South Street in Lucheng, took the loan for his own private production. Cao Fengming, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Shihuiyu, Changzhi, borrowed 100,000 yuan in the name of the masses and invested it in the cooperative as capital.
    Today, to check the bias in loans, it is even more important to make a liquidation from our loan policies and policies. The first is that the purpose of the loan lacks a class perspective, showing great blindness. In the past years, when issuing loans, it was only generally proposed that "support the production of the masses and enliven finance", but it was not clear who must be supported in today's rural production. When we summarize the role of loans, we only look at the general benefits from rural production, and do not delve into who exactly benefits from the loans. Therefore, a large number of loans are given to wealthy classes "to add flowers to the brocade", while poor farmers who really need support are often "sighing for loans". Secondly, many policies, procedures, and other regulations related to loans also lack class character, such as strictly limiting the use, emphasizing the combination of floating capital, etc. If it does not meet the above regulations, it will be rejected. The urgent needs of the hired and poor are often temporary subsidies for living materials (such as grain exchange), or the solution of certain current difficulties, so as to free up their hands for production. Because they have no savings, there is no way to "combine" loans with "floating capital". Other conditions such as emphasizing accelerated turnover and guaranteeing repayment, as well as cumbersome procedures and other regulations, essentially close the door to loans for the hired and poor. In addition, our certain bureaucratic styles have indeed contributed to the emergence and development of loan bias. We often only care about issuing loans and do not ask about the results, and rarely ask who exactly they are lent to.
    Based on the above situation, we suggest that all localities should conscientiously launch a mass loan investigation work from bottom to top, and through checking the loan lines and practices, truly achieve a decisive change in the loan work in the entire region; and earnestly solve the practical problems in the loan, and ensure the true implementation of the hired and poor line.

　　检查纠正贷款中的富农路线
    太行行署建设处
    秋收以后，我区连续发放了救济贷款与冬产贷款五万万五千万元，救济粮二百万斤，其目的是为了扶持雇贫农民进行生产，渡过歉收难关。但由于我们的阶级思想不明确，所以在贷款工作中，发生了许多急须纠正的严重偏差，而其中最为显著的是贷款中的富农路线。
    磁县苏村的信用部放款二十万元，大部分贷给了有车有牲口的户，无资本和工具的雇贫却无人管。雇贫鲍付银组织了五个人想到林县贩货，但无资本不能干。脑子村第一次贷款十八万元，贷给了有车有牲口的中农，雇贫想贷款买生产工具，但因不合所谓“运输条件”而未贷上。还有的村不组织雇贫找生产门路，使雇贫不敢贷款或被迫卖了粮作本钱。如平顺王庄李俊楼母亲所说：“生产没本，只有卖粮食，想贷款又无生产门路，怕还不了，不敢贷”。临城黑沙村十二户中农中每户平均贷到一万六千余元，但十五户雇贫，每户却只平均贷到五千余元，比之中农，相差一半。
    更错误的是有些不惟没扶持雇贫，反而贷给了被斗了的地主。如临城黑沙村给四户斗争对象贷款两万元。有些村虽然进行了检查，计算了分配情况，但检查的还极不深刻，观念上还很模糊。我们要求各地在进行检查时，不能单纯计算户数与钱数的百分比，还要计算出户与人的平均数，更重要的是明确我们贷款的基本目的是为支持雇贫而非其他。
    在以往贷款中曾被提倡过的合作路线，实际上也是一种富农路线。因很多的合作社是将贷款自己拿上作了投机生产。如已检查出的和顺上阳村，共贷款三十万元，合作社竟全部拿上到邢台去作了投机买卖。长治有些村也发生这种现象。他们说：“合作社赚了钱也是为群众呀。”听来似乎也言之成理，实际目前很多的合作社还未进行改造，雇贫还未掌权，而中农以上成份的资本还占着统治地位，即如赚几个钱雇贫也得不了什么利。
    五专署与武安支行曾有过这样的决定：“旧贷款在有合作社的地区，全部转入合作社，扶持建立信用业务；新贷款在有合作社的地区，一律通过合作社，无合作社者，通过贷款建立合作社之信用业务”。这种作法的结果，除依然要走富农路线外，而在贷款的目的性上也很模糊，显然未把通过贷款扶持雇贫生产为目的，而是把贷款当成一种发展合作社的手段了。
    我们认为在合作社未普遍改造以前，不应强调通过合作社，应该组织各村的雇贫贷款评议委员会，一切贷款通过雇贫来决定，直接发给群众。关于旧贷部分应让雇贫重新审查，进行清理与转贷。合作社只可分担管理款项帐目等工作，但无决定发放之权。关于信用业务的建立，主要应放在集中群众游资的基础上。
    造成贷款工作中的种种流弊，是和村级组织的成份与作风有绝大关系的。由于某些村干成份不纯与作风不正，所以贷款通过他们时，往往不是攫为私有便是贷之不当，甚至还有的贷给斗争对象。如潞城黄碾南街街长魏招胜，将贷款拿上作了私人生产。长治石灰峪农会主席曹凤鸣，假借群众名义，贷款十万元，投入合作社作了资本。
    今天检查贷款中的偏向，更重要的还应该从我们贷款的方针与政策上来作一番清算。首先是贷款的目的上缺乏阶级观点，表现了很大的盲目性。历年来在发放贷款时只是一般提出：“扶持群众生产，活泼金融”，但没有认清今天农村生产中必须扶持的究竟是那些人。在我们总结贷款的作用时，也只是从农村生产中一般得利结果上看，而不深究因贷款而得利的到底是那些人。所以大量贷款是给了富有阶层“锦上添花”，真正急须扶持的贫苦农民却往往是“望款兴叹”。其次是有关贷款的许多政策、手续等等规定，也缺乏阶级性，如严格限定用途、强调结合游资等，如与以上规定不合，便拒而不贷。雇贫层急迫的要求往往是生活资料的暂时垫补（如粮食换季），或当前某种困难的解决，以便抽出手来进行生产，因素无积蓄，也便无从以“游资”来“结合”贷款。他如强调加速周转、保证归还等条件，及繁琐的手续等种种规定，实质上是向雇贫关闭了贷款之门。此外我们某些官僚主义的作风，确也助长了贷款偏向的产生与发展，我们往往是只管放款，不问结果，究竟贷给那些人便很少过问了。
    根据以上的情形，我们建议各地要认真从下而上的发动一个群众性的查贷工作，通过检查贷款的路线与做法，真正把全区贷款工作取得一个决定性的转变；并切实解决贷款中的实际问题，保证雇贫路线的真正贯彻。
