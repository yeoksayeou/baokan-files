　　Destroying Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Henchman Wei Yonghe's Lair
  　Our Army Captures Yuanshi County Seat
    Western Hebei Masses Voluntarily Join the War to Avenge Grievances
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 5th】A unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army completely liberated Yuanshi City, 90 li south of Shijiazhuang, on the morning of the 3rd. The Wei Yonghe unit of the puppet Hebei Security 5th Regiment, which was guarding the city, was completely annihilated except for a unit of over 300 people who broke through to the north and are being surrounded and annihilated by our army. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. With this, the approximately 800-li section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway north of Baoding City and south to the outskirts of Anyang is now entirely under our control.
    Note: The traitor Wei Yonghe, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, relied on the protection of the Japanese invaders and harmed the local people. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, this traitor, along with other bandit leaders entrenched in Yongnian such as Xu Tieying and Wang Zemin, were appointed by the Chiang bandits as "Vanguard Forces," serving as Chiang bandit henchmen, continuing their rape, arson, and murder, accumulating numerous blood debts. In the battle in which Wei Yonghe surrounded Dongzhuang, Dongzheng and other villages on May 14th this year, they massacred 26 people. Three households in Dongzhuang Village were completely wiped out, and even a 60-year-old man and children were not spared. In Dongzheng Village, a woman who had just given birth was gang-raped by Wei Yonghe's five bestial soldiers and then stabbed to death with bayonets. The vice-chairman of the village women's association was tied to a large cart and dragged for five li, her skin and flesh were worn away, and she was then cut into three pieces. A 13-year-old child in Beiyan Village was even disemboweled and his heart taken. Villages within 30 li of the city were looted, and the land was deserted. The people of Yuanshi, however, have always persisted in their struggle, using tunnel warfare in coordination with local armed forces. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Wei Yonghe, in a panic, carried out large-scale looting in the city, dismantling residents' doors and windows to use as fortifications. The people of Yuanshi were extremely enthusiastic in supporting the Liberation Army, and they had long demanded that the Liberation Army quickly remove the Yuanshi stronghold and punish this heinous criminal. After the liberation of Yuanshi, the masses were extremely happy and are preparing to hold a meeting to celebrate.
    【Report from Our Newspaper】After Shijiazhuang was liberated, the people of western Hebei, who had long suffered from the ravages of Chiang's puppets, hoped that our army would quickly remove the last enemy stronghold in western Hebei – Yuanshi City. They all discussed, saying: "Shijiazhuang has been liberated, and now only Yuanshi is left in this large area. If we remove this nail, we can live a peaceful life!" Hao Wei from Nangou, Lincheng, said: "This time, Wei Yonghe is like a turtle locked in a jar in the city. We can't let him bite people again. Catch him quickly!" The masses at the junction of Gao(yi), Yuan(shi), and Zan(huang) all said: "Attack Yuanshi quickly! After Yuanshi is taken, we can divide the land in peace!" The people of Yuanshi had been made destitute and homeless by Wei Yonghe, with few people left, weeds growing everywhere, creating a no-man's land. Now they are writing letters to the Liberation Army, accusing Wei Yonghe of his heinous crimes. In Wu Village, Fifth District, over 80 head of livestock were taken away, over 100 shi of grain was robbed, five or six people were killed, furniture was smashed, and countless houses were burned down just last year. They wrote in their letter: "Wei Yonghe has made it so that all the people in our village cannot work during the day and cannot sleep at night. We hope you will get rid of this great scourge soon!" After the women of Duzhuang recounted Wei Yonghe's bestial acts, they wished they could skin him alive and eat his flesh to quell their hatred and avenge their grievances. They said in their letter: "We don't hope for anything else, we only hope that the warrior brothers will catch Wei Yonghe and hand him over to us so that we can take revenge. Then we will sing a victory song for you and make you a few more pairs of victory shoes that fit you perfectly so you can go and kill more enemies!" Nearly a million people in western Hebei are now eagerly hoping that the Liberation Army will completely and thoroughly annihilate the Wei bandits and capture Wei Yonghe alive to be publicly tried by them. The masses on the northern front are voluntarily organizing stretchers and preparing white flour, pork, dry firewood, and cabbage to support the front lines. (Chun Yi)
    【Report from Our Newspaper】Following the liberation of Shijiazhuang, a strategic hub for transportation and logistics in North China, in coordination with Jin-Cha-Ji troops, our local armed forces in western Hebei immediately cooperated with a unit from central Hebei to besiege Yuanshi City, the last stronghold of Chiang's puppet army in western Hebei. At 4:00 PM on the 22nd, after a twenty-minute artillery test fire, the general attack began. For a time, cannons thundered, and smoke billowed into the sky. After 5:00 PM, our army crossed the outer trench, which was more than two zhang deep, advanced to the South Gate, and occupied a portion of it. After a night of fierce fighting, the enemy defending the gate suffered heavy casualties under our fierce artillery fire and the commanders' and fighters' courageous attacks. The next day (23rd), after 4:00 PM, thick smoke rose from the East, South, and West Gates, enveloping the entire city. After setting fires, the defending enemy successively fled into the city. The East, South, and West Gates were immediately brought under our complete control. (This city has no North Gate) (Chun Yi)

　　摧毁蒋匪爪牙魏逆永和老巢
  　我军攻克元氏县城
    冀西群众自动参战伸冤报仇
    【新华社晋察冀前线五日电】晋察冀解放军一部于三日晨完全解放石家庄南九十里之元氏城。据守该城之伪河北保安第五团魏永和部，除一部三百余人突围北窜正遭我军围歼外，其余已悉数就歼，战果正清查中。至此，平汉北段北自保定城垣、南迄安阳外围约八百里之铁路线，已全为我控制。
    按：魏逆永和在抗战时依附于日寇卵翼下，为害当地人民。日寇投降后，该逆与盘踞永年之许铁英、王泽民等匪首同被蒋贼委为“先遣军”，充蒋匪爪牙，继续其奸淫烧杀，血债累累。今年五月十四日，魏逆包围东庄、东正等村一役，即屠杀群众二十六人。东庄村有三户遭杀绝，六十岁老汉与儿童均未幸免。东正村一产妇遭魏逆五兽兵轮奸后，并以刺刀乱刺而死。该村妇女会副主席竟被其将两足缚大车上拖了五里，皮肉磨烂后，尚被切成三段。北岩村一十三岁孩童竟遭其开膛取心。城周三十里以内村庄均遭其洗劫，土地荒无。元氏人民则始终坚持奋斗，以地道游击战配合地方武装作战。此次石庄解放，魏逆惊慌之余，又在城内大肆抢劫，将居民门窗拆作工事。元氏人民支援解放大军情绪极高，他们早就要求解放大军迅速拔除元城据点诛此凶顽。元氏解放后，群众欢欣异常，正筹备开会庆祝。
    【本报讯】石庄解放后，久受蒋伪摧残的冀西人民就盼望我军赶快拔掉冀西最后一个敌人据点——元氏城，都议论着说：“石家庄解放了，咱这一大片光剩下元氏了，起了这个钉子，就能痛痛快快过安生日子啦！”临城南沟郝卫小说：“这回魏永和在城里跟王八闭在瓮里一样，可不能再让他咬人啦，赶快捉吧！”高（邑）元（氏）赞（皇）交界处的群众都说：“赶快打元氏吧，打了元氏，咱就能安安生生的分田地了！”元氏群众以前被魏永和弄得妻离子散，家破人亡，人烟稀少，遍地野草，制造了无人区。现在他们纷纷致书解放军，控诉魏匪滔天罪行。五区吴村光年前就被牵走牲口八十多头，抢走粮食一百多石，杀了五、六个人，家具被砸毁，房子被烧掉无数。他们信上这样写着“魏永和弄得俺全村人白天不能做活，黑夜不能睡觉，希望早点给除了这个大害！”杜庄妇女痛诉魏逆的兽行后，他们恨不得剥了他的皮吃了他的肉才能消仇雪恨。她们信上说：“我们别的不盼望，只盼望战士兄弟哥们捉到魏永和交给我们，让我们报仇，到那时我们给你们唱个胜利歌，再给你们多做几双胜利鞋，你们穿上不大不小正合适，好再去多杀敌人！”现冀西近百万群众都在热望解放军彻底干净全部歼灭魏匪，活捉魏永和交他们公审。北线群众自动组织担架，准备白面、猪肉、干柴、白菜，支援前线。（纯一）
    【本报讯】继配合晋察冀部队解放华北交通轮轴战略要地石家庄之后，我冀西地方武装即配合冀中某部围攻冀西分区蒋伪军最后的据点元氏城。二十二日下午四时，经炮兵试射二十分钟之后开始总攻，一时炮火雷鸣，烟屑冲天，五时以后我军即越过二丈多深的城关外沟，进至南关占领一部，经一夜激战，守关之敌在我猛烈炮火及指战员勇猛冲杀下伤亡甚重，次日（二十三日）下午四时以后东、南、西三关浓烟大起，笼罩全城，守敌于纵火之后先后遁入城内，东、南、西三关当即为我全部控制。（该城没北关）（纯一）
