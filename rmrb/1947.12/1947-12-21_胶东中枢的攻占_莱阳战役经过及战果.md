　　Jiaodong Hub Captured
    ——The Battle of Laiyang: Course and Results
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 19th dispatch] The front headquarters recently announced the course and results of the Laiyang Campaign as follows: After the victories at Gaomi, Jinkou, and Haiyang, the People's Liberation Army launched a continuous and powerful offensive, surrounding the Jiaodong Peninsula's hub, Laiyang City, on the evening of December 4th. An attack was launched on the outlying strongholds outside the city, and by the 7th, we had captured them one by one, completely eliminating the enemy's periphery. On the evening of the 8th, our assault teams, under the cover of intense artillery fire, attacked the city simultaneously from all directions. The defending enemy stubbornly resisted, relying on strong fortifications, and released poison gas against us (Note: A Qingdao dispatch from Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency on the 15th falsely accused us of "releasing tear gas," which is entirely a shameless counter-accusation by thieves crying "stop thief!"). Our brave soldiers broke through the city walls and charged into street fighting. The enemy retreated to various core strongholds, and we attacked them point by point. The battle ended at 11:30 PM on the 13th, and all the Chiang bandits defending the city were annihilated. According to preliminary statistics, a total of over 10,000 Chiang bandits were eliminated, including the entire 106th Regiment of the 36th Brigade of the reorganized 54th Division, the 1st Battalion of the 108th Regiment, the 1st Company of the directly subordinate howitzer battalion of the division, the directly subordinate mountain artillery company of the 36th Brigade, the 4th Company of the 1st Regiment of the Ministry of National Defense's Transportation Corps, the 9th Company of the 2nd Regiment, the 42nd and 45th substations of the 9th Logistics Station of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, and the rear guard offices of the reorganized 8th and 25th Divisions, etc., totaling more than 4,000 people; the Chiang Kai-shek's Shandong 13th Administrative Inspectorate, the Chiang Kai-shek's Laiyang County Government, the Laiyang Security Brigade, the Police Brigade, etc., totaling more than 2,000 people; and more than 4,000 local "Homecoming Legions." Among them, over 2,500 Chiang Kai-shek's regular troops and over 5,000 Chiang Kai-shek's security team "Homecoming Legions" were captured alive. Over 1,500 Chiang Kai-shek's regular troops, including the commander of the 106th Regiment, Hu Yi@, were killed or wounded, along with over 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek's security team "Homecoming Legions." The following were seized: 2 howitzers, 4 mountain guns, 29 mortars, 60mm guns, etc., 348 light and heavy submachine guns, 1,048 rifles and carbines, 7,000 rounds of various artillery shells, over 400,000 rounds of various bullets, 1,200 hand grenades, 20 vehicles, 7 radio stations, over 30 war horses, and many other military supplies.
    While we were besieging Laiyang, the Chiang bandits in Jiaodong panicked and hastily pieced together eight brigades to come to the rescue. The bandits were terrified and gathered together, advancing north through Lingshan north of Jimo and Jiangshan. The first batch consisted of the 76th Brigade of the reorganized 9th Division, the 156th Brigade and 159th Brigade of the reorganized 64th Division, the 198th Brigade of the reorganized 54th Division, and the 57th Brigade of the New 74th Division. The second batch consisted of the 42nd Brigade of the 1st Honor Division of the reorganized 8th Army, the 8th Brigade of the reorganized 54th Division, and the 36th Brigade, which were transported by sea from Yantai and Haiyang to Qingdao and then joined the northward reinforcement. On the 9th, the 76th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 9th Division, attached with a tank company and a howitzer battalion, began to advance north from Jiangshan, encountering our attacks along the way. By the 13th, the bandits launched four fierce attacks on our Shuigoutou line. Our army calmly fought back and repeatedly repelled the bandit's charges. In particular, on the 12th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on Shuigoutou with three regiments and over ten tanks. We engaged them in bayonet combat. After a day of fierce fighting, the enemy was completely defeated, leaving behind numerous corpses. In total, during several days of blocking battles, we killed or wounded over 3,500 Chiang bandits from the reorganized 64th Division, the reorganized 54th Division, and other units, destroyed three enemy tanks, and seized a quantity of goods that is currently being inventoried. The fighting is still continuing in the Shuigoutou area. Another part of our army took advantage of the Chiang bandits drawing troops to reinforce, and successively recovered the two cities of Huangxian and Haiyang.
