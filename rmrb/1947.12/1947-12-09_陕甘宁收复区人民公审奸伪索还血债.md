Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th: In the recovered areas of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the broad masses of working people have risen up to air their grievances and seek revenge, publicly trying traitors and confiscating their property to distribute among the poor masses. In Yanchuan County, 60,000 people separately held public trials of major traitors such as Jiang Mengheng, Chang Yuntian, and Wang Xihou, the enemy and puppet county magistrates and deputy magistrates. At the meetings, victimized masses accused the traitor Wang of personally leading the Jiang bandits to rob and rape in Yongping and other places in the county, and of capturing and killing 13 of our cadres. The families of the victims cried out for the lives of their husbands and sons. The wife and two orphans of the victimized guerrilla member Di Fuming mournfully accused Wang, raising sticks to beat him. The entire audience was enraged and unanimously decided to execute Wang and others publicly on the spot. The Yincheng City in Mizhi County established a revenge and disaster relief committee to lead the city's residents in confiscating the property of traitors and distributing it to the poor people who had suffered from the Jiang disaster. More than 600 women in the city participated in the revenge meeting with high emotions. Gao Jintai, a traitor who led the enemy to rape women during the enemy occupation, was also publicly tried and executed. Female pro-enemy elements such as Feng Guanghua and Du Shuqi, who had served as enemy and puppet inspectors and persecuted innocent women, were released after publicly admitting their mistakes and apologizing. After farmers in the five townships of the Minquan District in the county exposed the crimes of pro-enemy despotic landlords such as He Wanshan and He Lunjiu, all of their property was confiscated and distributed to 212 poor farmers in Dongxiang. Farmers in Huan County City recovered all the land illegally seized by the pro-enemy landlord Che Wencai, and confiscated all his property and land to distribute to poor farmers. The masses in Zhenchuan (newly established county) and Hengshan counties held revenge and grievance meetings in the rain, executing eight pro-enemy despotic landlords, including Hui Changle and Cao Yuxi. Farmers in the Xiangshui District of Zhenchuan County liquidated 11 pro-enemy elements, confiscating 125 shi of stored grain to distribute to hundreds of poor farmers. After the recovery of Yanchang, Zichang, Qingjian and other counties, thousands of people gathered to celebrate and launch revenge campaigns.
