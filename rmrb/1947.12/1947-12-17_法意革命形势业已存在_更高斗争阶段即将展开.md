The great general strike action in France involving millions of workers has temporarily and victoriously concluded. Because the French executioner Schuman agreed to provide living allowances and wage increases for workers during the strike, the General Confederation of Labor has issued a nationwide call for striking workers to return to work. The Italian reactionary leader De Gasperi also bowed to the striking workers in Rome, "completely satisfying the workers' demands," allowing the Roman working class to achieve a significant victory.

This vigorous struggle of the French and Italian working classes exhibits the following significant common characteristics: First, an unprecedented scale and tight organization. The number of people participating in the strike in France once increased to four million, a record since the end of the war in the history of the workers' movement. During the strike struggle, workers established a Central Strike Committee and strike support committees. In various strike areas and factories, there were also squads and command posts, ensuring consistent action and the necessary material basis for the struggle. At the same time, in some areas (such as Marseille and Saint-Étienne in France, and Milan in Italy), factories, transportation lines, government agencies, and cities were organized, controlled, or even occupied. Second, strong solidarity and persistence. During this month-long struggle, the French and Italian working classes resolutely opposed the reactionary派 and their lackey right-wing union traitors' divisive policies. The French Socialist Party and the Italian Christian Democratic Party's union bureaucrats, who betrayed the nation, tried every possible means to sabotage the strike and organized so-called "return-to-work movements," but this divisive conspiracy ultimately went bankrupt under the unanimous condemnation of French and Italian workers. Third, the courage and tenacity of the struggle. In this struggle, the French and Italian working classes resolutely and courageously fought back against the reactionary governments' bloody armed suppression, and bloody clashes and "street battles" occurred everywhere. Coal miners in northern France, under attack by tens of thousands of reactionary armed forces, maintained control of the mining areas, thwarting the reactionary government's attempt to use strikebreakers to resume work. Workers in Marseille thwarted the reactionary government's attempt to use the army to load and unload goods. Demonstrators in Naples braved the hail of bullets and disarmed fully armed military police with their bare hands. In many conflicts between French and Italian workers and reactionary military police, they continued to fight in pools of blood, regardless of their own injuries. In particular, agricultural workers in some areas of southern Italy took up hoes, rifles, and any available weapons to resist the suppression of the military police, giving the movement the character of armed struggle.

The French and Italian strike struggles demonstrate that because the French and Italian reactionaries are resolutely implementing traitorous dictatorial policies, the severe economic crisis cannot be alleviated and is instead deepening. The catastrophe of fascist restoration and the loss of national independence has befallen the French and Italian people, and the people of these two countries can no longer continue to live as before. The combativeness and courage they have displayed in the struggle, the determination and heroism of the most steadfast sections of the working class, indicate that the French and Italian people have realized and demonstrated their determination to unite and fight for survival. This signifies that a revolutionary situation already exists in France and Italy. Therefore, the surging waves of strikes and demonstrations in France and Italy demanding guaranteed living conditions and the defense of national independence and freedom, although temporarily ended due to the partial satisfaction of economic demands, do not indicate a decline in the tide of struggle, but rather indicate that a higher stage of struggle is about to unfold, at least in France. Currently, the British and American reactionaries, led by US imperialism, are trying to support the French and Italian reactionaries and use all their power to strangle the revolutionary movement of the French and Italian working classes. As L'Humanité said when assessing the return to work, "Serious dangers still lie ahead for the working class, requiring preparation for the arrival of even sharper struggles." This means that this large-scale strike and demonstration struggle is, on the one hand, a victorious review of the French and Italian working classes' own strength; on the other hand, it has educated their own ranks and vanguard, further educated and united the broad masses of peasants and urban petty bourgeoisie, and learned lessons to prepare for future victorious decisive battles.

Another major event of the past week was the adoption of the new constitution in Bulgaria. Prime Minister Dimitrov pointed out: "The main principle of the new constitution is that all power belongs to the people and serves their interests. The privileges of private capital and any possibility of the bourgeoisie exercising rule have been completely and permanently eliminated. The administrative leadership of the People's Republic belongs to workers, peasants, artisans, and liberal professionals." Undoubtedly, the new constitution marks Bulgaria's imminent entry into a new historical stage of transition from New Democracy to socialism. At the same time, a new coalition government led by the Bulgarian Communist Party has been established, which guarantees the smooth implementation of the new constitution. In addition, the solidarity among the New Democratic countries of Southeast Europe and between them and the Soviet Union is continuing to develop. Following the South-Bulgarian mutual assistance treaty, South-Hungary signed a twenty-year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance on the 11th, and Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, and Hungary and the Soviet Union have successively concluded trade and economic agreements. These are of great significance for safeguarding world peace and reviving the post-war economy.

Soviet-French relations, Soviet-British relations, and Anglo-American-French relations are also among the noteworthy issues of the week. When the Schuman reactionary government was intimidated by the resistance struggle of the working class, under the instigation of US imperialism, it slandered the Soviet Union for "inciting" strikes and even went so far as to expel Soviet citizens from France. This conspiracy, aimed at diverting and dividing the focus of the French working class' struggle and openly opposing the Soviet Union, was met with a stern counterattack from the Soviet government, which formally announced the suspension of trade negotiations with France and ordered the French repatriation delegation stationed in the Soviet Union to withdraw from Soviet territory. The head of the French repatriation delegation in the Soviet Union also had to declare in his statement that the Soviet Union should not be held responsible for the deterioration of Franco-Soviet relations. On the other hand, US imperialism has further tightened its control over France, which has even aroused the jealousy of Britain, "secretly resisting American policy towards France." At the same time, Britain, seeing that its domestic economic crisis is deepening and American aid is nowhere in sight, has had to seek help from the Soviet Union. British Secretary of Commerce Wilson personally went to Moscow to resume trade negotiations with the Soviet Union and reached an agreement in principle on all major issues.

Over the past week, the Council of Foreign Ministers has continued to discuss the issue of German economic principles. Because the Soviet Union has insisted on defending the Potsdam Agreement and striving for the rapid realization of peace in Europe, partial agreements have been reached on certain issues of the German economy. However, on key issues such as reparations, the United States, Britain, and France are still trying to undermine the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements, so no resolution has yet been reached. On the occasion of the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, the German Socialist Unity Party convened a People's Congress for "Striving for a Just Peace and German Unity" on the 6th and 7th. More than two thousand delegates attended, and even representatives of many parties and people's organizations from the Western occupation zones, despite the various obstacles and difficulties imposed by the British, American, and French occupation authorities, still risked crossing the border to attend. At the meeting, the majority of delegates unanimously demanded the immediate establishment of a democratic central government, the conclusion of a democratic peace treaty, and the guarantee of German political and economic unity. The meeting also elected a delegation of seventeen people to attend the Council of Foreign Ministers and express the above legitimate appeals of the German people. These voices reflect the true will of the German people and are a powerful blow to the attempts of the United States, Britain, and France to establish an imperialist peace.

### 法意革命形势业已存在  更高斗争阶段即将展开

    法意革命形势业已存在
    更高斗争阶段即将展开
    法国几百万工人参加的伟大的总罢工行动，已胜利暂告结束。由于法刽子手舒曼答应了给予罢工期间工人的生活津贴和增资等条件，总工会已通令全国罢工工人复工。意反动头子加斯贝利则对罗马总罢工工人表示了低头，并“完全满足了工人的要求”，使罗马工人阶级，取得了重大胜利。
    法意工人阶级这一次轰轰烈烈的斗争，表现了如下几个显著的共同特点：第一，规模的空前巨大，和严密的组织性。法国参加罢工的人数一度曾增至四百万，这是战争结束以后工人运动史上的创例。在罢工斗争中工人建立了中央罢工委员会，罢工后援委员会，在各罢工地区及工厂，又有纠察队、指挥部等组织，因此保证了斗争的行动一致和必要的物资基础。同时在若干地区（如法国的马赛、圣德田，意大利的米兰等）有组织的控制甚至占领工厂、交通线、政府机关及城市。第二，强固的团结与坚持。在这次持续一月之久的斗争中，法意工人阶级坚决反对了反动派及其豢养下的右派工贼的分裂政策。叛卖民族的法国社会党和意大利基督教民主党的工会官僚们，曾千方百计进行破坏，并组织了所谓“复工运动”，但这种分裂阴谋，终于在法意工人的一致唾弃下破产了。第三，斗争的勇敢与顽强性。法意工人阶级在这次斗争中，坚决勇敢地反击了反动政府血腥的武装镇压，到处发生了流血冲突和“市街战”。法国北部的煤矿工人在上万的反动武装部队攻击下，始终控制了矿区，打破了反动政府利用工贼的复工企图。马赛的工人更使反动政府利用军队起卸货物的图谋破产。那不勒斯的示威者冒着枪林弹雨，赤手空拳的解除了全副披挂的军警的武装。法意的许多工人与反动军警的冲突中，不顾自己身上的创伤，在血泊中继续斗争。尤其是意南部若干地区的农业工人，更拿起锄头、步枪及一切可用的武器，抗拒军警的镇压，使运动带有武装斗争的性质。
    法意罢工斗争说明了：由于法意反动派坚决实行卖国独裁政策，严重的经济危机不特无法缓和而且日趋深重，法西斯复辟和丧失民族独立的大灾难已临到全法意人民头上，这两国人民也已经不能继续照旧生活下去了，他们在斗争中所表现的战斗性与勇气，工人阶级最坚定部分的果敢与英勇，表示法意人民已意识到并表现了决心团结起来死里求生。这标志着：法意两国的革命形势业已存在。因此，法意两国要求保障生活条件，维护国家独立和自由的澎湃的罢工示威浪潮，虽因经济要求的部分满足而暂行结束，但在目前法国看来，这绝不说明斗争浪潮业已低落，而显示着更高的斗争阶段即将展开。目前以美国帝国主义为首的英美反动派正图支援法意反动派，用一切力量扼杀法意工人阶级的革命运动。诚如人道报在估计复工时曾说：“在工人阶级面前尚有严重的危险，需要准备更尖锐斗争的到来”。这就意味着这次大规模的罢工、示威斗争，一方面是法意工人阶级对自己力量的胜利检阅；另一方面借此教育了自己的队伍与先锋队，进一步教育和团结广大农民与城市小资产阶级，并吸取经验准备未来的胜利决斗。
    这一周来另一重大事件，就是保加利亚新宪法的通过。季米特洛夫总理指出：“新宪法之主要原则为：一切权力属于人民，并为其利益而服务。私人资本之特权及资产阶级实行统治之任何可能性，已被完全和永远的消灭。人民共和国行政上之领导权属于工人、农民、手工业工人及自由职业者”。无疑的，新宪法标志着保加利亚即将进入由新民主主义过渡到社会主义的新历史阶段。同时，以保共领导的新联合政府已经成立，这就保证了新宪法的顺利执行。此外，东南欧新民主主义国家间及其与苏联间之团结正继续发展中，继南保互助条约后，南匈十一日又签订了二十年友好互助条约，捷克与苏联，匈牙利与苏联则又先后订立了贸易协定与经济协定。这些对保卫世界和平及复兴战后经济，都具有重大的意义。
    苏法、苏英关系与英美法关系，也是一周来值得注意的问题之一。当舒曼反动政府慑于工人阶级的反抗斗争时，在美帝国主义的指使下，即诬蔑苏联“煽动”罢工，甚至不惜驱逐法境苏侨，此种旨在转移和分裂法国工人阶级斗争视线和公开反苏的阴谋，遭受了苏联政府的严正反击，正式声明停止与法国进行贸易谈判，并令法国驻苏撤侨代表团撤离苏联国境。法驻苏撤侨代表团团长在其声明中亦不得不声称：法苏关系恶化情势之造成，苏联不应负责。另一方面，美帝国主义则更进一步的控制法国，这甚至引起了英国之忌妒，“隐秘地阻抗美国的对法政策”；同时，英国又鉴于国内经济危机之更益深重，美国之援助又遥遥无期，于是不得不有求于苏联，英商务大臣威尔逊亲赴莫斯科恢复与苏的贸易谈判，并在一切主要的问题的原则上获得了协议。
    外长会议一周来，继续讨论德国经济原则问题，由于苏联坚持捍卫波茨顿协定，并力争迅速实现欧洲之和平，因此在德国经济的某些问题上，得到了部分协议，但是关系赔偿等关键问题，美英法仍力图破坏雅尔塔、波茨顿协议，致迄未获得任何解决。值外长会议开会之际，德国统一社会党于六、七两日召开了“争取正义和平与德国统一”的人民代表大会，到会代表两千余人，甚至西部占领区的许多党派与人民团体的代表，也不顾英美法占领当局的种种阻碍与留难，仍冒险越境与会。在会上，大多数代表一致要求立即建立民主的中央政府，缔结民主和约，保证德国政治与经济的统一。会议并选出由十七人组成之代表团，要求出席外长会议，以申述德国人民上述正当的呼吁。这些呼声反映了德国人民的真正意志，乃是对美英法企图建立帝国主义和平的有力打击。
