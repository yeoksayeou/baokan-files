　　Employing the Poor through Loans to Buy Livestock and Working Tirelessly in Transportation
　　[Our newspaper's report from Lucheng] Song Village in the Fourth District is a village severely affected by the ice disaster. After deeply employing the poor to organize production, it was discovered that 28 poor peasant households, including Li Laicheng and Wang Derong, lacked the capital for production. For example, Li Laicheng said, "The government keeps telling us to engage in production, but I only have a cart and no livestock. I can't afford to buy livestock with the little money I have, so I have no way to do it." Zhang Huangye said, "My family only has 60,000 yuan. If someone could lend me 20,000 yuan, I could buy livestock for transportation." After raising these issues, 500,000 yuan in loans were immediately granted to the poor peasants. Within three to five days, they bought seven head of livestock. After Li Laicheng bought livestock, he transported coal to Shigiejie. Others transported coal twice a day, but he left before dawn and didn't return until dark, making three trips a day, earning 3,240 yuan a day. Inspired by his example, others followed suit, making three trips a day. Wang Derong borrowed 10,000 yuan to sell peanuts, earning 1,000 yuan a day, and repaid the loan with surplus in half a month. The whole village organized 232 full laborers, 75 semi-auxiliary laborers, and 118 head of livestock. The full and semi-laborers were paired up to drive carts, run workshops, and participate in large and small coal mines. The remaining 112 semi-auxiliary laborers and children accumulated fertilizer and ash, earning 4,000,400 yuan in twenty days.

　　雇贫贷款买牲口起早搭黑忙运输
    【本报潞城讯】四区宋村是遭冰灾严重村，经过深入雇贫组织生产，发现了没生产资本的雇贫农李来成、王德荣等二十八户。如李来成说：“政府光说叫生产，我光有车没牲口，买个牲口吧，钱少买不起，我就没办法。”张黄叶说：“我家只有六万元，要有人给我借上两万元，就能买上个牲口运输。”经过这样提出问题后，当即把贷款五十万元全部贷给雇贫农，三、五天他们即买牲口七头。李来成买上牲口后，到石圪节运煤，旁人每天运两遭，他赶天不明就走，天黑还不回来，一天能运三趟，每天即赚洋三千二百四十元。在他这样带头下，其他人也都照着做，每天运三趟。王德荣贷了一万元，卖花生，一天赚一千元，半个月把贷款赚回来还有余。全村共组织起来全劳力二百三十二名，半辅劳力七十五名，畜力一百一十八头，全半劳力配搭赶车，搞作坊，参加大小煤窑，下余半辅劳力儿童一百一十二名，积肥积灰，二十天来即赚洋四百万零四百元。
