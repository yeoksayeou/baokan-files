　　Taihang First District County Heads Meet to Study and Inspect Winter Production
    [This newspaper Taihang News] The First District Commissioner's Office convened a joint meeting of county heads, heads of the Relief Federation, and heads of county cooperative associations from the entire district on December 6th to examine and promote winter production. The meeting involved reporting and discussions, lasting ten days. 1. The past understanding of the disaster situation was insufficient, mainly because: First, there was a lack of in-depth understanding of the actual situation of the broad masses of hired and poor peasants. Cadres only approached village cadres and activists who had turned over well, received more fruits, or only looked at the year's harvest from a regional perspective, lacking specific class investigation. In winter production, although there were some achievements in textile and transportation, a large-scale, mass-based, and led movement had not yet been formed in the entire district. Only the emotional resistance of a small number of village cadres and activists to winter production was seen, and their thoughts of "mechanically waiting," "seeing the small and not the big, pursuing quick profits," etc., were recognized as the main thoughts of all the masses (especially the hired and poor) at present. Or, the production activities of some activists and middle peasants were expanded as "winter production achievements are not small." These phenomena must be corrected immediately. 2. The future winter production policy is to use the hired and poor peasants as the backbone, focusing on textile and transportation, and organizing mass labor and funds. At present, we must seize the time and work hard. Impractical plans should be corrected through actual calculations, and it should be recognized that the difficulties of the hired and poor are that they have no raw materials, tools, or capital, and their skills are low. Therefore, we must find ways to solve, support, and mobilize them in all aspects, but we must also overcome the cadres' bestowal viewpoint. In textiles, correct the thinking of "rather spin three taels of coarse than two taels of fine." In transportation, small-scale cooperative activities should be combined with "production, transportation, and sales" according to local conditions. Overcome the viewpoint of some cadres who only manage the transportation team and do not care whether there are conditions for the task. 3. Cooperatives should change direction, organize mass production, overcome the viewpoint of cadres concentrating mass shares, operating themselves to earn dividends for the group, and unilaterally serving the masses. Furthermore, with the hired and poor as the backbone, mobilize the masses, cleanse and transform cooperative cadres, so that cadres who truly represent the interests of the hired and poor become masters. The fruits of struggle in cooperative funds should be discussed at a general meeting of all hired and poor, and through the peasants' association, truly fairly and reasonably distributed to the hired and poor masses. 4. The loan issue was also discussed in detail. Finally, the conference called on the leadership to open up their minds, break the cadre circle, use the hired and poor class as the backbone, and unite the middle peasants to carry out production.

　　太行一专县长集会研究检查冬季生产
    【本报太行讯】一专署为了检查推动冬季生产，于十二月六日召开全区各县长、救联主席、县联社长联席会议，汇报、讨论，前后经过十日。一、过去对灾荒的认识不足，主要原因：首先是没有深入了解广大雇贫阶层的实际情况，干部只接近村干部及积极分子，他们翻身较好，或多分果实，或只从地区上看年成，缺乏具体的阶级调查。在冬季生产上，虽然纺织运输都有一些成绩，但全区尚未形成大规模的、广大群众性的、有领导的运动。只看到少数村干部积极分子对冬季生产的情绪抵抗，把他们“机械等待”、“看小不看大，追逐暴利”等思想，认识为全部群众的（特别是雇贫）当前主要思想，或者把部分积极分子及中农的生产活动，扩大为“冬季生产成绩不小”。这些现象，必须立即纠正。二、今后冬季生产方针，是以雇贫阶层为骨干，以纺织运输为主，组织群众劳力资金。在当前我们要抓紧大干一番，不合实际的计划，应通过实际计算加以纠正，并应认识雇贫的困难是既无原料、工具、资本，技术又低，因此，要从各方面想法加以解决扶植和发动，但也要克服干部的恩赐观点。纺织上，纠正“宁纺三两粗，不纺二两细”的思想。运输上，应根据当地条件，“产、运、销”结合小型社的活动。克服某些干部只管运输队，不管有无条件的任务观点。三、合作社，扭转方向，组织群众生产，克服干部集中群众股金，自己经营为群业赚钱分红，片面为群众服务的观点，再则是以雇贫为骨干，发动群众，清洗改造合作社干部，使真正代表雇贫阶层利益的干部当家，合作社资金中的斗争果实，应召开全体雇贫大会讨论，通过农会，真正公平合理的分给雇贫群众。四、关于贷款问题，也经过了详细的讨论。最后，大会号召领导上打通思想，打破干部圈子，以雇贫阶层为骨干，团结中农进行生产。
