    Successful Winter Production in the Third District of Pingshun
    Earning Three Dou of Rice Per Person Per Month
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 16th] The winter production movement to make up for deficits in the Third District of Pingshun has achieved remarkable results in the past month, with each laborer earning an average of more than three dou of rice. On December 2nd, the district held an expanded cadre meeting to summarize the achievements of winter production in November. The entire district has earned more than 3,876,000 yuan, spun more than 3,900 jin of cotton, and woven more than 5,300 zhang of cloth. The cooperative is responsible for exchanging sideline income for grain, purchasing a total of 133,984 jin of millet. The district averaged more than 10 jin of rice earned per person, and each laborer earned an average of more than 53 jin of rice. In addition, the entire district chopped more than 150,000 jin of firewood and accumulated more than 135,000 dan of fertilizer. The most significant feature of the district's leadership in the winter production movement is that it has begun to "do everything for the poor and hired peasants," and the poor and hired peasants have played a leading role in winter production. They were also given priority in organizing transportation, spinning, weaving, and charcoal burning, using the proceeds from production to exchange for rice, because they were having immediate difficulties with food and drink. For example, in Douyu, there were initially only a few porters. Later, in order to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants, thirteen poor and hired peasant households were first organized for transportation, earning 36,000 yuan. In Xizhuang, the poor and hired peasants had no raw materials for spinning and weaving, so the cooperative bought 600 jin of cotton and lent it to them first. After summarizing, they further discussed how to implement winter production and complete the plan to make up for the more than 15,000 shi of disaster deficit as soon as possible. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, the district joint cooperative decided to set up four return stations in Lucheng, Rencun in Linxian, Henandian in Shexian, and Chengguan in this county; and in order to facilitate the exchange of sideline products for grain, it has organized a grain store and established a cotton cloth exchange station to regulate raw materials. Finally, it was proposed that in order to implement winter production, it is necessary to first check whether the poor and hired peasants have received loans and whether their difficulties have been truly resolved, so as to help the poor and hired peasants take action first and lead all the peasants to intensify winter production.

    平顺三区冬季生产获成绩
    每人一月赚米三斗
    【本报太行十六日电】平顺三区冬季生产补窟窿运动，月来已获显著成绩，每个劳力平均赚米三斗多。该区于本月二日召开扩干会，总结十一月份冬季生产成绩，全区已赚洋三百八十七万六千余元，纺花三千九百余斤，织布五千三百余丈；合作社负责以副业所得换粮，共买下小米十三万三千九百八十四斤，全区平均每人赚米十斤多，每个劳力平均赚米五十三斤多。另外，全区共打柴十五万余斤，积肥十三万五千余担。该区领导冬季生产运动的最大特点，是开始作到了“处处为贫雇”，贫雇在冬季生产中起了带头作用。并尽先组织贫雇运输、纺织，烧木炭等生产，以生产所得来换米，因为他们当下吃喝就比较困难。如豆峪开始只有少部分驮脚的，后为解决贫雇困难，先组织十三户贫雇运输，赚洋三万六千元。西庄贫雇纺织没原料，合作社买花六百斤先借给他们。总结后，进一步讨论如何贯彻冬季生产，提早完成补齐一万五千多石灾荒窟窿的计划。区联社为保证实现这一计划，决定在潞城、林县任村、涉县河南店、本县城关设四个回脚站；并为便利副业换粮，已组织了粮行一座，设立花布兑换站一座，调剂原料。最后提出：要想贯彻冬季生产，首先应检查贫雇是否贷到款，他们的困难是否真正解决，以扶助贫雇首先行动起来，带领全体农民加劲冬季生产。
