　　Tunliu’s model village, Yuan Village, led by hired and poor peasants, overcame the middle peasants' winter leisure thoughts of "focusing on the big, neglecting the small," and created a large-scale textile and transportation labor exchange. During discussions on winter production in the village, it was found that middle peasants were not very active. Some of them said, "If everyone engages in production after the autumn harvest, it won't be profitable. A few days ago, delivering coal to Yuwu earned more than ten yuan per catty, but now it's only nine yuan. Weaving a bolt of cloth this spring earned two dou of rice, but now it only earns seven or eight sheng. Working all day is barely enough to eat; why suffer the cold outside?" Some others said, "Waiting for labor service duties will delay transportation, and going for transportation will delay labor service duties!" "Having livestock without people cannot transport, some people want to transport but don't have money, and some with money have no people or livestock," etc. At this time, the hired and poor peasants suggested, "Walking and eating is always better than sitting and eating, and working is always better than not working. Even if it doesn't make money, saving food is money." After repeated discussions, everyone reached a consensus and established a labor exchange method for textiles and transportation. Livestock are rated according to labor, with each 50 catties pulled equivalent to one point. Multiple trips are scored by the number of trips. Based on the strength of the livestock and willingness, they are divided into long-distance and short-distance teams. The long-distance team specializes in transportation, and the short-distance team handles short-distance transportation and labor service duties. For labor service, the long-distance team shares half the duties and divides half the profits. For transportation, they can settle accounts with the long-distance team based on total work. The profits earned by the two teams are divided in a six-four ratio (long-distance gets 60%, short-distance gets 40%). If a person leaves for labor service and only the livestock remains, if others use their livestock for transportation, each work unit is worth ten points of income. The person performing labor service earns thirteen points of work, and the profit is divided in a two-eight ratio (person gets 20%, livestock gets 80%). If it is a labor-capital cooperation, capital gets 20%, people get 30%, and livestock get 50%, with profits divided accordingly. During the discussion on textiles, someone raised the issue, "Knowing how to spin but not how to weave means others get the profits!" Only after Li Sisheng introduced the textile labor exchange method did everyone's thinking become clear. On the 18th evening, they organized overnight. All 43 livestock in the village formed a long-distance transportation team, and 27 livestock formed a short-distance transportation team. Liu Xiucai and others were selected as captains. All women and semi-laborers in the village, except for the elderly, weak, and disabled, a total of 270 women, were organized into 36 groups, accounting for 94% of the women in the village. Seven girls aged eleven or twelve also formed a textile group, with Liu Xianying as the group leader, aiming to compete with the adults. Zhou Dajie, who is 55 years old this year, also announced her plan, promising to spin three liang of cotton per day. Under the slogan of "Model plus Model," the entire village, men and women, has enthusiastically launched a textile and transportation campaign.

　　原村打破中农“看大不看小”思想
    组织长短途运输班生产支前互助变工
    【本报太岳五日电】屯留模范村原村雇贫带头，打破中农看大不看小等冬闲思想，创造了纺织运输大变工。该村讨论冬季生产中，发现中农不太积极，他们中有些人说：“收秋以后大家都搞生产就不赚钱了，前几天到余吾送煤一斤赚十几块钱，这几天成了九块了；今春织一匹布赚二斗米，现在只赚七、八升，劳动一天只赶个嘴，何苦在外受冷挨冻呢？”还有些人说：“等支差吧，就误了运输，去运输吧，又误了支差！”“有牲口没人不能运输，有人想运输没有钱，有钱的又没人或没牲口”等；这时雇贫农就提出：“走吃总比坐吃强，劳动总比不劳动强，即使不赚钱赶了嘴，省下粮食就是钱。”经过大家再三讨论，意见一致了，订出了纺织、运输的变工办法，即牲口按劳评分，每拉五十斤顶一分，多拉时按次顶分，按牲口强弱和自愿，分为长途班和短途班，长途班专门运输，短途班进行短途运输及支差。如支差，长途班对半顶差对半分红；如搞运输，可和长途班按工总算帐。两班所赚钱，按长六短四的办法四六分红，人支差走了只剩下牲口，如别人拿他的牲口去运输时，每工顶十分赚差，支差人顶十三分工，获红利二八分红（人二牲口八），如是劳资合作时，资本顶二分、人顶三分、牲口顶五分，按二、三、五分红。在讨论纺织的时候，有人提出：“会纺不会织，利是人家得！”这时李思圣介绍了纺织变工办法后，才打通了大家的思想。于十八日晚上，连夜进行组织，全村四十三个牲口组成长途运输队，二十七个牲口组成短途运输队，并选出刘修才等分任队长。全村妇女全半劳力除老弱残废外，二百七十个妇女全部组织起来，成立了三十六个小组，占全村妇女百分之九十四，下有七个十一、二岁的女孩，也成立了一个纺织组，并选出刘仙英为组长，要和大人竞赛。今年五十五岁的周大嫂，也宣布了自己的计划，保证每天纺三两花。现全村男女“在模范加模范”的口号下，已热烈展开纺织运输运动。
