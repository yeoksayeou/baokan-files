　　Important Correction
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] In the article "On Loyalty and Honesty," the twentieth paragraph states: "Whoever accepts the erroneous method of selecting cadres creates favorable conditions for those leading groups, making it easier for them to replace responsible working personnel with intimate small cliques..." should be changed to: "Whoever accepts the impermissible method of selecting cadres creates a situation in which the leading collective of responsible working personnel is excluded, and what replaces it is a small family or gang of relatives who try to live in peace with each other and do not criticize each other." Also: In the twenty-sixth paragraph, "The inspection was not carried out perfectly and skillfully organized," should be changed to: "There was no perfect and skillfully organized inspection of the implementation." (Note: The article is in this newspaper on the 5th; the two paragraphs referred to above are in the sixth and twelfth paragraphs of the article on page 3.)

    【新华社陕北五日电】“论忠诚与老实”一文第二十段中：“谁接受了错误的选择干部的方法，谁就替那些领导集团造成有利条件、便于他们以亲密的小宗派………来代替负责的工作人员”一句，应改为：“谁接受了不许可的选择干部的方法，谁就造成一种情况，在这种情况下，负责工作人员的领导集体被排斥了，而代替它的却是尽力和平共处，而不相互批评的亲人小家族、行帮”。又：第二十六段中：“没有执行完善而熟练地加以组织的检查”，应改为：“对执行没有完善而熟练地有组织的检查”。（按：该文见五日本报，以上所指两段见第三版该文第六段及第十二段。）
