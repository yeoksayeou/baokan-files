Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Budapest dispatch: The Budapest Committee of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party recently held a special meeting and passed a resolution strongly condemning the French Parliament's passage of the anti-labor law and the French Socialist Party's betrayal of the working class, stating: "We are deeply shocked by the French Socialist Party's vote in favor of the anti-strike law and its assistance to the government, which claims to be following the 'third way,' in restoring fascism. This committee specifically proposes that the Central Committee of our party protest to the French Socialist Party against this behavior, which endangers the authority and glory of socialism throughout Europe. This committee also maintains that the French Socialist Party should immediately withdraw from the government." To this end, the Budapest Committee has written to all local party committees in Hungary to support the above proposal, in order to support the heroic struggle of the French workers and, on behalf of the 200,000 organized workers of Budapest, to guarantee solidarity with the French workers.

To this end, the committee also held a mass rally in the stadium on the evening of the 9th, passing the same resolution condemning the reactionary policies of the social democratic parties of Western European countries, and emphasizing that the working class should strengthen its unity to fight against the growing imperialist offensive. Kirchi, Deputy General Secretary of the Budapest Committee, said in his speech at the meeting: "European socialist workers are watching with anger the leaders of the French Socialist Party. Anyone who participates in passing laws against organized workers cannot be a good socialist. American imperialists are waging a desperate battle against the working class in order to monopolize the European market, while socialist traitors like Saragat, supported by the United States, are defending imperialist interests and depriving workers of the right to strike, which is of course fascism." Ulo, Chairman of the Budapest Committee, continued his speech, emphasizing: "The correct policy of the Socialist Party is to cooperate closely with the Communist Party to defend the unity of the working class. In foreign policy, we believe that the Soviet Union is a torch illuminating our path."

    斥法社会党背叛工人
    【新华社陕北十六日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利社会民主党布达佩斯党委，日前召开特别会议，通过决议，对法议会通过反劳工法及法社会党对工人阶级之背叛行为，力加痛斥称：“法社会党投票赞成反罢工法，并协助标榜走‘第三条路’之政府恢复法西斯主义，我们深为震惊。本党委特提议本党中央向法国社会党抗议此种危害全欧社会主义威权与光荣之行为。本党委并主张法国社会党应立即退出政府。”布城党委为此已函请全匈各地该党党委赞同上项提议，以支持法国工人之英勇斗争，并代表布城二十万有组织工人，保证与法国工人团结一致。
    该党委并为此于九日晚在运动场召开群众大会，通过同样决议，遣责西欧国家社会党之反动政策，并强调工人阶级应加强团结，以与日益增长之帝国主义进攻作斗争。布城党委副总书记基尔奇在大会演说称：“欧洲社会主义工人，正以满腔愤怒注视法国社会党之领袖，不论何人，凡参与通过反对有组织工人之法律者，即不可能是好的社会党人。美帝国主义者为独占欧洲市场，正对工人阶级作殊死战，而由美国支持之萨拉盖特之流社会党叛徒，则卫护帝国主义利益，剥夺工人罢工权利，当然即法西斯主义者。”布城党委主席乌罗继起演说，强调：“社会党之正确方针为与共产党亲密合作，卫护工人阶级团结，在外交政策上，我们认为苏联是照明我们道路的火炬。”
