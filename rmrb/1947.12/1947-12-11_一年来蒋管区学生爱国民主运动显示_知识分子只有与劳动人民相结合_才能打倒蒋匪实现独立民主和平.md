Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Comprehensive report: The Patriotic Democratic Movement of Students in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas Over the Past Year:

    The past year has been a year of unprecedented upsurge in the great patriotic democratic movement of students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The spirit of opposing American imperialist aggression against China and opposing Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, dictatorship, and civil war runs through every link of the entire movement. It marks the increasing strength of the people's forces in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the increasing universality of political awareness, and the increasing depth of the crisis in the rule of Chiang and the United States in China. With heroic actions, it exposed the traitorous and harmful face of the Chiang family bandits, educated the broad masses of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and eliminated their illusions about Chiang and the United States. It promoted and organized the patriotic democratic movement in the cities of the Kuomintang-controlled areas to become part of the new high tide of the nationwide anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution in China since the end of this summer, and bravely advanced towards the goal of national independence, democracy, and peace.

    Over the past year, the student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has experienced three upsurges. The first upsurge was the anti-violence movement caused by the rape case of a Peking American soldier on the evening of December 24 last year. This was an outburst of the Kuomintang-controlled area people’s accumulated resentment against the US imperialist aid to Chiang Kai-shek's aggression against China and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country. After the appalling case of American soldier Pi Pearson raping Peking University student Shen Chong was reported, students in Peiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai were extremely angry and immediately went on strike, marched, and demonstrated in protest. They put forward demands such as the immediate withdrawal of all American troops stationed in China, severe punishment of the American murderer, a public apology to the Chinese people, cessation of military aid to Chiang Kai-shek for the civil war, and the abolition of the Chiang-US commercial treaty and air transport agreement. They also opposed Chiang Kai-shek's flattery of foreign countries and betrayal of the country, which won the support of the people across the country. In the struggle, students in various places generally established "Committees to Protest Against American Military Atrocities" and "Shen Chong Support Associations" as standing leadership institutions, launched street anti-violence propaganda, initiated a signature campaign calling for the withdrawal of American troops, and a movement to love domestic goods and resist American goods. This vigorous patriotic democratic movement broke through the sabotage, obstruction, and persecution of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and continued for more than three months. More than 500,000 students were involved in this struggle, covering dozens of large and medium-sized cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. It powerfully exposed Chiang Kai-shek's ugly face of betraying the country and forced American imperialism to deceptively sentence the American rapist Pi Pearson to fifteen years in prison (on August 12, the US Navy Department shamelessly announced its cancellation). It encouraged the Chinese people's confidence in opposing the US-Chiang and striving for national independence, democracy, and peace, and powerfully promoted the patriotic democratic movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

    The second upsurge was the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement in May and June. As a result of Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war destroying production and expanding currency, prices in various parts of the Kuomintang-controlled areas soared in May this year. With conscription of soldiers and grain, and heavy taxes, the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas universally felt that they could not survive. After Shanghai students held a demonstration on May 4 to protest against official capitalist hoarding and skyrocketing prices, Kaifeng Henan University, Nanjing Central University, Shenyang Northeast University, and other schools followed suit with strikes and demonstrations. Peiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places responded one after another. The students demanded increased public funding, improved treatment for faculty, staff, and public educators, and improved education. Chiang Kai-shek not only rejected these demands, but also mobilized military police, gendarmes, secret agents, and cavalry in Nanjing and Tianjin simultaneously on May 20 to rush at the students, creating the "May 20th Massacre" that shocked the world. The slogans of the struggle were subsequently expanded to oppose civil war, strive for peace, oppose conscription of soldiers and grain, overthrow bureaucratic capitalism, liquidate corrupt officials, stop skyrocketing prices, and severely punish the perpetrators of the atrocities. Strikes, demonstrations, and street propaganda were launched fiercely in various parts of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The Chiang bandits frantically mobilized a large number of military police and secret agents to deal with unarmed students with extremely cruel arrests and massacres in various places. In Nanjing, many students were shot to death or had their eyes blinded and ribs broken by the Chiang bandits, but the students still snatched the Chiang bandits' water cannons and bravely resisted. In Wuhan, the Chiang bandits killed Wuhan University students with American-made dumdum bullets. In Shanghai, American military police assisted Chiang police in arresting students. The Chiang bandits' brutal suppression failed to curb the students' heroic struggle. In June, the North China and National Student Federations, which led the student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, were successively established. The students organized accusation teams, using dramas, songs, and slogans to accuse the Chiang bandits of their bloody crimes, and launched fundraising and rescue movements, actively rescuing and assisting arrested and injured students. In July, they organized academic guarantee committees to resist the Chiang bandits' massive expulsion of students and dismissal of professors. In August, Shanghai and Peiping-Tianjin launched patriotic education assistance movements, with students promoting the use of domestic goods and resisting American goods on the streets. Relying on their own efforts and the sympathy of people from all walks of life, they solved the economic persecution imposed on the students by the Chiang bandits. At this stage, the students' heroic struggle and the Chiang bandits' brutal suppression powerfully exposed the fascist essence of the Chiang family bandits' unwillingness for peace and opposition to democracy.

    The third upsurge was the movement of students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to fight for freedom and oppose oppression in October and November. This was the direct result of the Chiang bandits' arrest, massacre, massive expulsion of students, and dismissal of professors during the summer and autumn of this year. During this period, the situation of students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was more dangerous than before, and the Chiang bandits' persecution was also more rampant than before. However, in order to protest against the Chiang bandits' arrest of students, Peiping students broke out four strikes again in October. At the end of October, the flames of anti-oppression and struggle for freedom quickly spread, triggered by the Chiang bandits' killing of Yu Zisan, chairman of the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association. Strikes spread to Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Kunming, Xiamen, and other places. They called on students in the Chiang-controlled areas to oppose oppression and fight for freedom, oppose fascist arrests, and demanded severe punishment of the murderers of Yu Zisan, and the immediate release of arrested students in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas. In order to implement the above-mentioned just demands and accuse the Chiang bandits of their crimes of massacre, the schools successively issued letters to teachers and students, letters to compatriots across the country, held anti-persecution meetings, and memorial services for the martyrs. Among them, Zhejiang University held three strikes, each lasting a week. Five thousand students in Peiping broke through the Chiang bandits' obstruction to hold a memorial service. More than 20,000 people from more than 30 middle schools in Kunming held two general strikes, putting forward the firm slogan of "We will never stop until we achieve our goal" in the demonstration. In the students' resolute struggle, the Chiang bandits' Peiping Pacification Headquarters was finally forced to release the four students arrested during the fundraising.

    The scale of the student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas this year is unprecedented. Not only university and college students are involved in the struggle, but also primary and secondary school students and faculty members. In terms of the number of people, the region, the persistence and sharpness of the struggle, as well as the strictness of the organization, the tenacity of the struggle, and the persecution suffered by the Chiang bandits, it has far exceeded the "May Fourth" and "December Ninth" two great student movements in Chinese history. In the struggle, the students highly demonstrated the heroic spirit of courage, determination, and calmness, and won the enthusiastic sympathy and support of the people across the country.

    After a year of heroic struggle and the Chiang bandits' bloody education, the political awareness of the students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and the mobilized ranks have been unprecedentedly strengthened. Almost all schools participated in each movement. The situation in which the Three Youth League ran rampant in various schools after the Japanese surrender has gone forever. The Chiang family bandits were still able to deceive a small number of students a year ago, such as the anti-Soviet parade last year. Now, however, because their dictatorial and traitorous faces have been exposed without reservation, they are resented and spurned by all students, and therefore take bloody suppression and stand against all students. In the spring of this year, the students also demanded that the Chiang bandits adopt an "independent and autonomous foreign policy." By June, students in Peiping declared in Democracy Square at Peking University: "The only way to achieve democracy in China is to use our blood to overthrow the dictators." An article in the joint edition of Peking University's wall newspaper "Our Attitude" advocated investigating and liquidating the Chiang bandits' responsibility for the anti-people civil war. The students have eliminated any illusions about Chiang and the United States and pinned all their hopes on the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive. Since the beginning of school this autumn, wall newspapers in various schools in Peiping and Tianjin have reported the successive victories of the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive, recognizing that only by completely eliminating the rule of Chiang and the United States by force can China achieve independence, democracy, and peace.

    The students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have experienced in the struggle that students can only effectively serve the victory of the Chinese revolution by integrating with the working people. In February this year, the anti-violence propaganda of students in various schools in Chongqing has penetrated into the countryside. On March 12, students of Chengcheng Middle School in Rongxian County, Guangxi, under the leadership of Principal Huang Weiruo, revolted and joined the rural people's armed forces in southwestern Guangxi. In June, students in Peiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai entered factories and rural areas to launch anti-hunger and anti-civil war propaganda. In August, Shanghai students went to eastern Zhejiang and returned to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou to conduct mobilization and education of the masses in rural areas.

    The great patriotic democratic movement of students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas over the past year has made the broad masses of people in the Chiang-controlled areas recognize that the US-Chiang are the common enemies of the Chinese nation, and pointed out with their heroic actions: unity is strength, only resolute struggle can seek survival from death, and intellectuals can only overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and realize a new China of independence, democracy, and peace by uniting with the working people.

    一年来蒋管区学生爱国民主运动显示
    知识分子只有与劳动人民相结合
    才能打倒蒋匪实现独立民主和平
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合报导：一年来蒋管区学生爱国民主运动：
    过去的一年，是蒋管区学生伟大的爱国民主运动空前高涨的一年。反对美国帝国主义侵略中国，反对蒋介石卖国、独裁、内战的精神，贯串在整个运动中的每一个环节。它标志着蒋管区人民力量的日益壮大，政治觉悟的日益普遍，与蒋美在华统治危机的日益深刻，它以英勇的行动揭穿了蒋家匪帮祸国殃民的奸贼面貌，教育了蒋区广大人民，并清除了他们对蒋美的幻想，它推动了和组织了蒋管区城市爱国民主运动成为自今年夏末以来中国全国性反帝反封建革命的新高潮的一部分，并迈步向着祖国独立、民主、和平的目标英勇前进。
    一年来蒋管区的学生运动曾经历了三个高涨。第一个高涨是由于去年十二月二十四晚北平美军强奸案而引起的抗暴运动，这是蒋管区人民对美帝援蒋侵略中国与蒋介石卖国的积愤的爆发。当美军皮尔逊强奸北大女生沈崇惨案传出后，平、津、京、沪学生愤怒异常，立即罢课游行示威抗议，并提出立即撤退全部驻华美军，严惩美军凶手，向中国人民公开道歉，停止以军火援蒋内战，废除蒋美商约、空运协定，反对蒋匪媚外卖国等要求，获得全国人民的拥护支持。在斗争中，各地学生普遍成立了“抗议美军暴行委员会”、“沈崇后援会”，作为随时领导机构，并展开了街头抗暴宣传，发起签名呼吁美军撤退运动，及爱用国货抵制美货运动，这一轰轰烈烈的爱国民主运动，冲破了蒋匪特务的破坏阻挠与迫害，继续坚持了三个多月。卷入这一斗争的学生在五十万以上，遍及蒋管区数十大中城市。它有力的揭露了蒋介石卖国的丑恶面目，迫使美帝国主义不得不欺骗的宣判了美军强奸犯皮尔逊十五年徒刑（八月十二日美海军部又无耻的宣布撤消）。它鼓舞了中国人民反对美蒋争取祖国独立、民主、和平必胜的信心，有力地推动了蒋管区的爱国民主运动。
    第二个高涨是五六月间的反饥饿、反内战运动。蒋介石进行反人民内战破坏生产、膨胀通货的结果，造成今年五月间蒋管区各地物价飞腾，并以征兵征粮与惨重的苛捐杂税，蒋管区人民普遍感到活不下去。五月四日上海学生举行反对官僚资本囤积居奇、物价狂涨的示威游行后，开封河大、南京中大、沈阳东大等校继之罢教罢课示威，平、津、渝、蓉各地纷纷响应。学生们提出提高公费，改善教职员、公教人员待遇，提高教育等要求，蒋介石非但拒绝了这些要求，而且在五月二十日同时在京、津两地动员了军警、宪兵、特务、骑兵，向学生冲杀，造成震动世界的“五廿惨案”，斗争口号随即扩展为反对内战、争取和平、反对征兵征粮、打倒官僚资本、清算贪官污吏、制止物价狂涨、严惩暴行凶手。罢课、示威游行、街头宣传在蒋管区各地猛烈展开。蒋匪慌张的动员了大批军警特务，在各地以极其残酷的逮捕屠杀对付徒手学生。在南京，学生多人被蒋匪枪杀或打瞎眼睛，打断肋骨，但学生们仍抢夺蒋匪水龙武器英勇反抗。在武汉，蒋匪以美制达姆弹打死武大学生。在上海，美宪兵协助蒋警逮捕学生。蒋匪的残酷镇压，并未能遏止学生的英勇斗争。六月间，领导蒋管区学运的华北及全国学联相继诞生。学生们组织了控诉队，用戏剧、歌咏、口号控诉蒋匪的血腥罪行，并展开募捐营救运动，积极营救援助被捕及受伤同学。并于七月间组织学业保障委员会，与蒋匪大量革退学生，解聘教授展开抗争。八月间，上海及平津展开爱国助学运动，学生们在街头宣传爱用国货，抵制美货。依靠自己的奔走与社会人士的同情，解决蒋匪所加于学生的经济迫害。这一阶段，学生们英勇斗争与蒋匪残酷的镇压两方面的事实，有力的暴露了蒋家匪帮不要和平，反对民主的法西斯本质。
    第三个高涨是十月、十一月间蒋管区学生争自由、反压迫运动。这是今年夏秋间蒋匪逮捕屠杀及大量革退学生，解聘教授的直接结果。在此时期，蒋区学生处境较前更为险恶，蒋匪迫害亦较前更为猖狂。但为了抗议蒋匪的逮捕学生，十月间北平学生又爆发了四次罢课，十月底反压迫争自由的火焰，即以蒋匪杀害浙大学生自治会主席于子三烈士为导火线而迅速展开，罢课遍及杭、京、沪、平、津、昆明、厦门等地。号召蒋区同学反对压迫争取自由，反对法西斯逮捕，并要求严重屠杀于子三烈士凶手，及立即释放蒋管区各地被捕学生。为了贯彻上述正义要求，控诉蒋匪屠杀罪行，各校纷纷发表告师长、同学书，告全国同胞书，召开反迫害会及于烈士追悼会。其中浙大曾三度举行为期各一周的罢课。北平五千学生冲破蒋匪阻挠举行追悼大会。昆明三十余大中学二万余人两度总罢课，在示威游行中，提出“不达目的誓不休止”的坚决口号。在学生坚决斗争中，蒋匪北平行辕终不得不被迫释放了在募捐中被捕的四个学生。
    这一年来蒋管区学生运动的规模是空前的，卷入斗争中的不只有大学专科学生，而且遍及中小学及教职员，论人数、地域、斗争的持久性与其尖锐性，以及运动中所表现的组织的严密，斗争的顽强，和所受蒋匪的迫害，均速超过“五四”、“一二九”两次中国历史上伟大的学生运动。学生们在斗争中，高度表现了勇敢、坚决、沉着的英雄气概，获得全国人民的热烈同情与支援。
    经过了一年来的英勇斗争与蒋匪血的教育，蒋管区学生的政治觉悟是空前提高了，动员的队伍是空前壮大了，每次运动几乎各校都全体参加。日寇投降后，三青团在各校横行猖獗的情形，业已一去不复返。蒋家匪帮一年前尚能蒙骗一小部分学生，如前年的反苏游行，现在则已因独裁奸贼面目暴露无遗，为全体学生所嫉恨唾弃，因而采取血腥镇压与全体学生为敌。今年春天学生们还要求蒋匪采取“独立自主的外交政策”，到了六月间，北平学生就在北大民主广场上宣称：“获致中国民主的唯一方法，是用我们的血打倒独裁者。”北大壁报联合版“我们的态度”一文，主张追究清算蒋匪反人民内战的责任。学生们已经清除了对蒋美的任何幻想，把全部希望寄托在人民解放军的大反攻。今秋开学以来，平津各校壁报纷纷报导人民解放军大反攻的节节胜利，认识到只有用武力彻底扫除蒋美的统治，中国才能获得独立、民主与和平。
    蒋管区学生在斗争中已经体验到，学生只有与劳动人民相结合，才能有效地为中国革命的胜利服务。今年二月间，重庆各校学生的抗暴宣传已经深入农村。三月十二日，广西容县成城中学学生，在校长黄未若领导下揭竿起义，参加桂西南的农村人民武装。六月间，平、津、沪学生进入工厂、农村展开反饥饿、反内战宣传。八月间，上海学生纷纷到浙东及返回川、滇、黔，深入农村进行动员与教育群众工作。
    一年来蒋管区学生伟大的爱国民主运动，已使蒋区广大人民认清了美蒋是中华民族的公敌，并以其英勇行动指出：团结就是力量，只有坚决斗争才能从死里求生，知识分子只有与劳动人民结合，才能打倒蒋介石，实现独立、民主、和平的新中国。
