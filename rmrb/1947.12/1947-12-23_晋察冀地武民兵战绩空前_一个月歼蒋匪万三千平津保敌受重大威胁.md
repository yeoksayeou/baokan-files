　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st -- This sub-agency's reporter recently summarized the battle achievements of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region's local armed forces and militia from the beginning of November to the beginning of this month, stating: During this period, the local armed forces and militia in various districts of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region widely launched attacks in coordination with the liberation of Shijiazhuang. The battle achievements were unprecedented. According to incomplete statistics, a total of over 13,000 enemy puppet troops were killed, wounded, or captured. The cities of Huolu and Yuanshi, as well as over 40 important enemy strongholds in the periphery of Shijiazhuang, were liberated. 23 artillery pieces of various types, 326 light and heavy machine guns, 6,620 rifles and carbines, nearly 500,000 rounds of ammunition of various types, 6 tanks, and 8 vehicles were seized. In the Tianjin-Beijing-Baoding triangle area, from the 4th to the 13th of last month, our troops launched an attack on the area west of Tianjin, successively capturing five important strongholds including Zhangjiapu and Chuhegang, annihilating over 490 enemy troops, including Zhang Shuyuan, the chief of staff of the five-county joint defense command. Another unit of our army suddenly appeared on the Beining Railway section of the Beijing-Tianjin line, blowing up three sections of the railway and capturing Huanghoudian, an important enemy stronghold ten li south of the Luofa Railway Station. Traffic between Beijing and Tianjin was temporarily cut off. On the 16th, a unit of our army active in the area south of Beijing, in one fell swoop, captured Guogongzhuang, eight li southeast of the Fengtai Railway Station, the North China enemy's railway dispatching base, and Matou Town, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits about seventy li south of Beijing, posing a major threat to the enemy puppets in Beijing. After our troops on the periphery of Baoding captured five strongholds including Xiaojinzhuang and Dajidian from the 18th to the 20th, the enemy's New Second Army shrank inside the city, daring not to act rashly, and the railway between Beijing and Baoding remained interrupted. Our series of victories greatly shocked the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding area. From the 24th of last month, the Chiang bandits' 16th Army's 22nd Division from Baxian and other places, and the 62nd Army's 95th Division from Shanfang on the Beining Railway via Anci, launched retaliatory "mopping-up" operations in the area, attempting to seize grain and conscript men along both banks of the Yongding River. Our local military and civilians persisted in fighting in their original locations, resisting step by step. Our army in western Tianjin launched an attack westward towards Jinghai, capturing Wangguozhen on the Grand Canal and Santanli, more than ten li southeast of Shengfang, inflicting heavy flanking attacks on the enemy engaged in the "mopping-up" operations. The enemy's "mopping-up" operations failed, and they retreated to their original defenses on the 30th. Currently, in the Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding triangle area, except for the cities of Baxian, Xiongxian, Guan, and Anci, which are still occupied by enemy troops, the cities of Yongqing, Xinzhen, Rongcheng, and Xincheng, as well as the vast countryside, are still being bravely defended by our local military and civilians.
