Schuman is the national chairman of the reactionary French Popular Republican Movement (MRP), and is a colleague of Bidault, who spends his days running around selling out the country.

At a time when the French workers' movement is surging, Schuman was elected Prime Minister of the Cabinet; he has backers.

The Popular Republican Movement itself is a representative of the bourgeoisie, and it has always sought to return France to the old world of capitalism. When Bidault formed a cabinet last June, he invited Schuman to serve as Minister of Finance. The first item on the agenda was the US lending of $1.3 billion and the cancellation of $1.8 billion in wartime lend-lease debts. Except for two or three months when it was a single-party Socialist cabinet, Schuman returned to serve as Minister of Finance in the Socialist Daladier cabinet this spring, until recently becoming Prime Minister of the Cabinet from Minister of Finance.

Schuman is not only the agent of the Popular Republican Movement and the United States in the French government, but also has a "close relationship" with de Gaulle. De Gaulle has always implemented his views on the French economy through Schuman.

Not only that, but he is also linked to the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party. When he first served as Minister of Finance last year, the right-wing Socialist Blum signed the US loan for him. When Blum failed to form a cabinet this time and he himself took office as Prime Minister of the Cabinet, he appointed the extremely reactionary leader of the right-wing Socialist Party, Mayer, as Minister of Finance. Therefore, he and the right-wing of the Socialist Party have always held on to the financial power of France. They represent the French bourgeoisie, allowing them to forever grasp the financial economy of France, to drink the blood of the working class and all working people to their heart's content, and to make the domestic economy of France deteriorate to the point of no return today, plunging the entire French people into hunger and hardship.

From this, it can be seen that Schuman has concentrated the will of all domestic and foreign bourgeois reactionaries to carry out the bloody task of selling out France's independent sovereignty and suppressing the workers' movement. (Ming)

### 法国人民之敌　舒曼介绍

　　法国人民之敌
  　舒曼介绍
    舒曼是反动的法国人民共和运动党的全国主席，和终日奔走卖国的比道尔是同党。
    舒曼在法国工人运动这样高涨的时候，被选出任内阁总理，他是有后台老板的。
    人民共和运动党本身就是资产阶级的代表，它始终谋使法国回到资本主义的旧世界去；在去年六月比道尔组阁时，就把舒曼请出当财政部长，上台的第一节目就是美国借给了十三亿的贷款和取消了十八亿美元的战时租借欠款。除了当中有两三个月是社会党一党内阁外，舒曼于今年春又出任社会党达拉第内阁的财政部长，一直到最近由财政部长变成内阁总理为止。
    舒曼不但是人民共和运动党和美国在法政府中的代理人，而且和戴高乐“关系甚密”，戴高乐始终通过舒曼而实施他对法国经济的主张。
    不仅如此，他和社会党右派领袖也是连在一起的。当去年做第一次财政部长时，社会党右派勃鲁姆替他签订了美国贷款；当这次勃鲁姆组阁失败，他自己出任内阁总理时，就把财政部长任命了社会党右派极反动的领袖梅耶来担任。所以他和社会党右派是始终不放开法国的财政大权的。他们代表着法国资产阶级，使他们永远把握法国财政经济，尽情地喝工人阶级和一切劳动人民的血，而使法国国内经济恶化到今日不可收拾的地步，使全法人民陷入饥饿困苦。
    由此可知，舒曼是集中了所有国内外资产阶级反动派的意志，来执行出卖法国独立主权和镇压工人运动的血腥任务的。（明）
