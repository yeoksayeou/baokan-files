　　Taihang Implements New Treatment Method
  　Generally Achieving Significant Results
    [Taihang, 27th Dispatch] The Military Region Health Department here has achieved significant results in promoting the new wound treatment method throughout the year—namely, strict disinfection, infrequent dressing changes, and frequent inspections. Generally, it has reached 80% non-suppuration, and the cure rate has reached 95%, doubling the previous rate. Even the most stubborn wounds of two or three years have mostly been cured. When promoting the new treatment method, the department established training classes, carried out political mobilization, and implemented ideological education on the new treatment method for medical personnel. Each military sub-district established a typical example for demonstration. During the Yu-Bei and Zhengtai campaigns, the medical team combined with the field hospital to organize wounded soldier reception centers. The original quota was 500 people, but due to the implementation of the new treatment method, the number of medical personnel required was greatly reduced, and the reception number reached around 700. Furthermore, the wounded soldiers' lives were improved. More than 20 dishes were made every day, and eggs, milk powder, and meat were available. The wounded soldiers were radiant and recovered their health early to return to the front lines. Guo Sihuai, the health chief of the Taigu Independent Battalion, promoted the new treatment method, changing the dressings of seven wounded soldiers only once every seven days, and they all recovered quickly. Wang Huajie, a doctor from the Yuci Independent Battalion, promoted this method to the local militia, and they all reflected: "The new treatment method can heal wounded soldiers quickly." In terms of training medical personnel, in addition to holding medical training classes, the department also recruited many liberated peasant children to serve as medical orderlies, taking great care of the wounded soldiers. For example, Shen Fuchu from the affiliated institute of the Health Department took care of 75 patients, helping them bathe, wash their feet, and with their bowel movements without being lazy at all. In addition, in supporting the southward expedition troops, the department transported more than 130 health personnel, and the supply of medical equipment reached more than 14 million yuan. They are still preparing to train a large number of medical personnel to serve the front lines.
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 29th Dispatch] Wounded soldiers in the Longhai Poju campaign recovered and returned to their units in less than half a month. The heroes immediately arrived safely at the field hospital after being wounded, underwent rapid surgery, applied new treatment methods, and enjoyed abundant nutrition such as twelve or thirteen taels of meat every day, allowing minor injuries to heal rapidly and serious injuries to turn from danger to safety. Zhang Huagui, whose right leg bend was shot through, only had his dressings changed twice in nine days, and the wound healed. Squad leader Chen Xiangfu was first wounded in the thigh and hospitalized for two months. The second time he was shot in the calf and hospitalized for thirty-two days. This time, he was lightly wounded in the left arm and recovered his health ten days after admission. The wounded soldiers who were about to return to the team crowded the hospital headquarters all day, asking for discharge certificates. When the Liberation Army who liberated Yutai passed by the hospital, they immediately ran into the ranks in groups.
