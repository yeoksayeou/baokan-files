[This dispatch from our newspaper's Taiyue office on the 10th] The pseudo-bandit Zhang Bohua's troops crossed the Yellow River from Tiexie, Mengjin, on the 3rd, and invaded the northwest slope and Yezhu areas of Meng County, where they were annihilated by our forces, with over 300 casualties. Over 1,000 fleeing "Security Regiment" bandits from Jiyuan and Meng counties in Mengjin, led by Lei Mingxuan, the bandit deputy commander of the four counties of Ji, Qin, Wen, and Meng, crossed the river to invade on the evening of the 3rd. Our Meng County Independent Battalion, responsible for river defense, and the militias of Yangcheng and Jiyuan counties resolutely resisted them. First, they routed the Meng County "Security Regiment" bandits between Qingzhuang and Yezhu. The bandits fled in panic across the river, and many drowned. The Jiyuan "Security Regiment," led by bandit leader Wei Ansheng, triggered mines at Potou and Dongzhai. Upon hearing the news, the Dubalian militia automatically rushed to Potou and other places to reinforce and routed the enemy. At 4:00 PM on the 4th, the Meng County Independent Battalion launched an encirclement and annihilation campaign against the remaining 200-plus Wei Ansheng bandit troops in Nanchen, resolving the battle in one hour. That evening, all the bandits were wiped out, and we have restored our original defense positions, and captured 40 more fleeing bandits. In this battle, over 130 bandits, including Colonel Deputy Commander Lei Mingxuan and Battalion Commander Xing Couting, were killed, over 90 were captured alive, including Cui Huamin, secretary general of the bandit headquarters, over 50 drowned while escaping by boat, and over 50 dispersed and returned home. We seized nine large and small wooden boats, two heavy machine guns, five light machine guns, 70 rifles, and a quantity of ammunition. We suffered only seven casualties.

[This dispatch from our newspaper's Taiyue office on the 10th] The Taiyue Military Region leaders specially issued a circular on December 5th to commend the victory in the blocking battle west of Meng County, pointing out that our Meng County Independent Battalion was able to closely cooperate with the local militia in combat, inflicting a major blow on the bandits at a very small cost and seizing a large number of spoils. This is a great contribution to consolidating the Yubei River defense and coordinating the bandit suppression in the western Henan district. This spirit of mobile operations and resolutely annihilating the enemy should be learned by all units in the region.

    【本报太岳十日电】伪匪张伯华部，于三日由孟津下铁谢渡河，北犯孟县以西北坡、冶戍地区，被我歼灭三百余人。流亡于孟津之济源、孟县伪匪“保安团”千余人，由济、沁、温、孟四县匪首副总指挥雷明轩率领，于三日晚渡河北犯，我担任河防之孟县独立营及阳城、济源两县民兵，坚决予以阻击，首先在清庄、冶戍间将匪孟县“保安团”击溃，匪仓惶渡河逃命，淹毙甚多。另由匪首卫安生率领之济源“保安团”，在坡头、东寨触雷爆炸，杜八联民兵闻讯自动赶赴坡头等地增援，将敌击溃。四日下午四时，孟县独立营即向残留南陈之卫安生匪部二百余人进行围歼，一小时解决战斗，当晚即将匪全部肃清，我已恢复原来防地，又搜捕残匪四十名。此次共毙匪上校副总指挥雷明轩、营长邢彩亭以下一百三十余人，生俘匪总指挥部秘书长崔化民以下九十余人，沉船淹毙者五十余人，溃散回家者五十余人；缴获大小木船九只，重机枪二挺、轻机枪五挺、步枪七十枝、弹药一部，我仅伤亡七人。
    【本报太岳十日电】孟县以西阻击战胜利，太岳军区首长特于十二月五日通令嘉奖，指出我孟县独立营能与当地民兵密切配合作战，以极小代价予匪以重大打击，缴获甚多，此对巩固豫北河防与配合豫西分区剿匪，实为极大贡献。此种机动作战、果敢歼敌之精神，应为全区部队学习。
