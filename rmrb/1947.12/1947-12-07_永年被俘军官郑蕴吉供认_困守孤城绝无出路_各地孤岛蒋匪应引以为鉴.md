(Jinan, Hebei, 5th) Zheng Yunji, the political training director of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Hebei Security First Column, who was captured during the liberation of Yongnian, is currently studying at the local People's Liberation Army Officer Training Corps. He said that they were trapped in Yongnian for two years and ultimately could not escape total annihilation. Chiang Kai-shek bandits trapped on isolated islands everywhere should take this as a warning from the past. He said: Bandit leaders Wang Zemin and "Iron Devil" initially had no confidence in defending the city. Chiang Kai-shek appointed them as commanders, and then sent Commander Zhong Yulin. Planes also delivered a large amount of ammunition and grain. Wang Zemin and "Iron Devil," these traitor bandits, became elated and said: "After making trouble for seven or eight years, we've finally gotten a genuine National Army, it's really not easy!" So they became emboldened and intensified their persecution of the people. Last summer, Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale civil war, attempting to open up the Pinghan Railway. Aid to Yongnian became increasingly active, with grain alone reaching 11.4 million catties. In addition to the huge amounts of ammunition, weapons, and grain, there were also luxury goods for the bandit leaders to enjoy. At its peak, up to 13 planes arrived daily. Three transport planes and one fighter plane were destroyed successively. Chiang Kai-shek and the Zhengzhou Command constantly issued commendations to boost morale. However, the Pinghan Railway was never opened, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits suffered repeated defeats, feeling overwhelmed. The daily number of planes arriving in Yongnian dropped sharply from 13 to one, and later only came every few days. In May, the Anyang airport was briefly controlled by the People's Liberation Army, and the Yongnian puppet bandits experienced their first food shortage. After 27 days, a plane from Xinxiang finally made contact again. In August, Xinxiang became strained, the transportation station moved to Zhengzhou, and Yongnian again faced a 23-day food shortage. The puppet bandits had already looted all the food from the residents left in the city, even the medicine from the pharmacies. By this point, everyone had no choice but to use small pots, basins, and bowls to boil and eat aquatic plants. Everyone thought of surrendering, but the Iron and Wang bandits remained deluded to the very end, even burying alive a company commander and eight soldiers who were actively trying to surrender. Finally, they were forced to break through, but the people's armed forces had set up defenses at every level, like an impregnable wall of bronze. Where could these starving ghosts escape? Therefore, apart from those who were lucky enough to be captured, all of them became Chiang Kai-shek's meaningless sacrifices. He concluded: "I am now awakened. The day of Chiang Kai-shek's demise is not far off. Being trapped in an isolated city offers no way out. Dying for Chiang Kai-shek is a futile death. We have truly tasted enough of that bitterness." Zheng is currently 44 years old, a native of Yongnian City, and formerly served as the head of the pseudo-county's education section. He is currently reflecting on his past crimes of colluding with the pseudo-bandits to harm the people.

　　永年被俘军官郑蕴吉供认
    困守孤城绝无出路
  　各地孤岛蒋匪应引以为鉴
    【本报冀南五日电】解放永年时被俘之蒋匪河北保安第一纵队政训主任郑蕴吉，正在此间解放军官教导团学习。他说，他们困守永年两年之久，而终未逃脱全部被歼，各地困守孤岛之蒋匪，实应引此为前事之鉴。他说：匪首王泽民、铁魔头开始并无守城信心，蒋贼委其为司令官，接着又派来指挥官钟毓麟，飞机又送来大批弹药、粮食，王泽民、铁魔头这些汉奸土匪这才得意忘形的说：“闹了这么七八年，现在居然闹上了个正牌国军，真不容易！”于是有恃无恐变本加厉地残害人民。去夏蒋贼发动全面内战，企图打通平汉线，对永年的接济也日趋积极，仅粮食一项即达一千一百四十万斤。巨量的弹药、武器、粮食之外，并有供匪首享用的奢侈品。飞机最多时每日达十三架。先后曾毁坏运输机三架、战斗机一架。蒋贼及郑州指挥部不断发嘉奖令打气，然而平汉路始终没有打通，蒋匪却迭遭惨败，感到自顾不暇了。每日到永年的飞机由十三架遽减至一架，后来竟隔几日才来一次。五月间，安阳飞机场一度被解放军控制，永年伪匪乃第一次绝粮。廿七天后，始又由新乡派来飞机连络。八月间，新乡吃紧，运输站移至郑州，永年又绝粮廿三天。伪匪早将留在城里居民全部食物抢光，连药材店里的药都抢吃光了。至此，都不得不各自用小锅、用盆子、用碗煮水草吃。人人思降，但铁、王二匪至死不悟，竟将一个活动投诚的连长与八个士兵全部活埋。最后逼令突围，然而人民武装层层设防，有如铜墙铁壁，这伙饿死鬼往那里去逃？因此，除了侥幸被俘的以外，全部都做了蒋贼无谓的牺牲了。他最后说：“我现在已经觉悟了，蒋贼灭亡之日已经不远，困守孤城绝无出路，给蒋贼卖命也是白死。那苦味我们真算是尝够了。”郑现年四十四岁，永年城人，曾任该县伪教育科长。彼自己过去与伪匪结合残害人民的罪恶，正在反省中。
