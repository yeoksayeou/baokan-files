Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th -- Local armed forces on the Central China Southern Front, coordinating with the People's Liberation Army's southern front campaign, are advancing broadly into the heart of the Chiang bandit gang. In the first half of this month, they annihilated over 1,000 enemy troops. On the 13th, the Haiqi local armed forces, in a one-hour battle, completely wiped out a battalion of the Chiang bandit Jiangsu Provincial Security Team in Fuan Town, eastern Hai'men, capturing over 300 men including the battalion commander, seizing 11 light machine guns, 2 small cannons, and over 200 rifles, setting an example of county-level local armed forces annihilating large numbers of enemy troops. Other local armed forces also launched attacks in Taixing, Nantong, and Jiangdu (Yangzhou), annihilating over 700 enemy troops below the level of security company commander, capturing four strongholds including Tianxingqiao and Xiongjiaxu, port towns on the Yangtze River eight miles southwest of Taixing, Yunliang River ten miles south of Jiangyan, and Dongshetown in central Nantong, and also coordinated with the masses to force the retreat of the Jinyu Town on the Tong (Nantong)-Lü (Sigang) Highway and the Wuzhuang strongholds north of Baoying City.
