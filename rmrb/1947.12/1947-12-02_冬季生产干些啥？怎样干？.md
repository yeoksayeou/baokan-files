What to do for Winter Production? How to do it?
Taihang Second Administrative Office Construction Section
    After the tense completion of autumn plowing, each county in Taihang Second District, through the poor and hired peasants calculating their family property and harvest, solved the problem of complacency, recognized the loopholes in the annual harvest, and clarified the need for sideline production to make up for it, turning to winter production without interruption. At the beginning of the movement, many people had a headache about winter production, thinking that there was nothing to do for winter production this year. If it were transportation, no one would use it; cooperatives were suffering from a lack of capital; if it were mountain goods, there would be no way out. There was not much confidence in winter production this year, which hindered the further development of winter production. The main reason was that the requirements for sideline production were high, they looked down on small profits, and only the idea of big profits supported them. They thought that it was only worth doing once if it was tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yuan. Therefore, the plans made by many villages were formal, waiting for opportunities to speculate. Some villages believed that they simply did not have the conditions for winter production, waiting and watching. As a result, they all looked down on the small and could not earn big money, lacking a long-term perspective of accumulating small gains into large ones.

    From the current production materials in various places, the path to winter production has already been revealed to us: The Heshun Tanyao Slope Cooperative, under the slogan of "eat whatever is available," organized fourteen people to go to the coal mine. In this way, in addition to solving the problem of coal for the masses, each person could earn 700 yuan per day, and six people were organized to sell coal in the city every day, once a day, earning 2,000 yuan. The cooperative strengthened the supply of essential goods to the masses, such as cotton, salt, and cloth, earning 1,000 yuan per day. Twenty women in the whole village, sixteen who could weave, two looms, and eighteen spinning wheels, spun and weaved every day, and could weave 108 zhang of cloth by the end of the year, which could achieve self-sufficiency in clothing. Sanjiaohe in the Seventh District of Xiyang organized a mountain cutting team, and Fangtai organized eight laborers to cut strips and weave baskets. Houjiadi Village organized thirty-three women to pick 4,000 jin of black leaves, selling them for 60 yuan per jin, earning 240,000 yuan. Yucheng Village in the Fifth District organized the first batch of twenty livestock to transport pots to Xingtai, earning 100 yuan per jin of foot price, earning 1,000 yuan per animal at a time, and now the second batch has been organized to go down. According to the conditions of the village, the Lijiazhuang Cooperative restored eight coal kilns, and 184 people had jobs. The cooperative established a coal station in Yetao, organized full labor transportation, which could both sell coal and earn transportation money. Their slogan is: "Work hard and carry coal to sell. If there are any difficulties, everyone will help. Those who are picky and捣蛋 (make trouble), starve to death and don't care." Ma＠yan Village organized to cut wooden poles and axles on the mountain. Zuoquan Shiyan Village opened a mule and horse shop by the road, which could both produce and facilitate transportation. In addition to women spinning flowers, men in Yushe Dazhai carried loads, picked up firewood, pulled coal, and sold charcoal, and spun wool to knit sweaters and vests, etc. Jia Yu's slogan is "Do whatever is profitable, and be flexible." From the above bits and pieces of information, there are dozens of production paths. As long as the masses are mobilized and organized, if large-scale sideline production cannot be carried out, small-scale sideline production is still possible. Of course, the stagnation of export goods will be affected. As long as we actively seek production outlets, widely find relationships, think of ways, and do whatever is profitable, accumulating small gains into large ones, we can still solve a big problem in a winter.

　　冬季生产干些啥？怎样干？
    太行二专署建设科
    太行二专各县在紧张完成秋耕后，通过贫雇算家当算年成，解决了自满思想，认识了年成窟窿，明确了需要副业来补，不换气的转向了冬季生产。运动一开始，不少人对冬季生产头痛，认为今年冬季生产没啥搞，运输吧，没人用，合作社苦于无资本，山货吧，没出路。对今年冬季生产信心不大，阻碍着冬季生产进一步的开展，主要原因是由于对副业生产要求高，看不起小利，只看大利的思想支持着，认为搞一次几万、几十万才值得，因此不少村订的计划陷于形式，等待机会，投机一下，有些村认为咱根本就没有冬季生产的条件，等待观望，结果都是小的看不起，大的赚不上，缺乏点滴的集小成大的长期着眼观点。
    从目前各地生产材料来看，已经给我们冬季生产启示了门径：和顺炭窑坡合作社，在“傍啥吃啥”的口号下，组织了十四个人上煤窑，这样，除解决了群众煤的困难，每人每天能赚洋七百元，并组织了六人每日到城卖炭，每天一次，能赚洋二千元。合作社加强供给群众必需品，如棉花、盐、布等，每日可赚洋一千元。全村妇女二十个，会织的十六个人，机两架，纺车十八辆，每天纺织，年底可织出布一百零八丈，能达到穿布自给。昔阳七区三教河，组织了砍山队，方台组织了八个劳力割条编捞。侯家底村组织了三十三个妇女采黑叶四千斤，每斤卖洋六十元，已赚洋二十四万元。五区库城村，第一批组织了二十个牲口往邢台驮锅运输，每斤赚脚价一百元，一次每头牲口赚洋一千元，现又组织了第二批下去。李家庄合作社，根据本村的条件，恢复了八座煤窑，一百八十四个人有了工作，合作社在冶陶成立了煤站，组织全劳力运输，既能销售煤炭，又能赚了运输钱。他们的口号是：“实干苦干担煤卖炭，有啥困难，大家帮办，挑皮捣蛋饿死不管”。马＠岩村组织上山砍木杠，砍车轴。左权狮岩村傍路开设了骡马店，一面且可生产，同时又便利了运输。榆社大寨除女人纺花外，男人担挑拾砍柴、拉煤卖炭，并纺毛打毛衣背心等，贾峪的口号是“啥有利干啥，灵活的搞”。从以上点滴材料看，就有几十种生产道路，只要发动组织起群众来，不能搞大的，点滴的副业生产还是有办法的，当然出口货物的滞塞，会受到影响，只要我们积极的寻求生产出路，广泛的找关系，想办法，啥有利就干啥，积少成多，一冬下来，还是能解决很大问题的。
