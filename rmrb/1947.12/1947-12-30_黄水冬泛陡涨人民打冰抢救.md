　　Yellow River's Winter Flood Rises Sharply; People Fight Ice and Carry Out Rescue
　　[This newspaper, JiluYu, urgent telegram dated 27th] The Yellow River's winter flood has risen sharply, unprecedented in a century. In mid-December, the weather here was unusually cold, and the Yellow River's water rose dramatically and rapidly. Because the riverbed downstream from Taochengpu (under the jurisdiction of Shouzhang County) is steep and narrow with many bends, the flowing ice accumulated like mountains in the areas of Dong'a, Weishan, and Jiagong, and the Yellow River's water was stopped by the ice. Since the water in the Weishan area was blocked by ice on the 17th, the Kunshan key project was also blocked by ice floes on the 18th. On the 19th, it further developed to the upstream Shouzhang and Sunkou key projects, and on the 23rd it developed to the Liqiao river bend in Puyang County. The water level in the Dong'a Weishan area rose by 3.6 meters, exceeding the high water level during the major flood season by 1.5 meters, only half a meter away from the river embankment. The river water overflowed the banks, and villages in the river滩 area were submerged in the flood and ice. People in Dong'a, Shouzhang, and other counties along the river rushed to the Yellow River day and night, braving the Kuomintang bandit gang's strafing from the opposite bank, bravely fighting the ice, and allowing the blocked floodwater to flow downstream.
　　[This newspaper, JiluYu, telegram dated 28th] The sudden winter flood, after the 19th, when the weather warmed slightly, the highest water level in the Dong'a and Weishan areas began to drop by half.

　　黄水冬泛陡涨人民打冰抢救
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日急电】黄水冬泛陡涨，为百年来所未有。本月中旬，此间天气奇寒，黄河大水急剧暴涨，由于陶城铺（属寿张县）以下的河身陡窄而湾多，流冰至东阿、魏山、佳工一带堆积如山，黄水被冰块阻止而停流。自十七日魏山一带水为冰阻后，十八日昆山险工处亦为冰凌所阻，十九日又发展至上游寿张、孙口险工，廿三日则发展至濮县李桥河湾。东阿魏山一带水涨三公尺六寸，超过大泛期的一公尺五水位，仅离河堤半公尺，河水出槽漫滩，河滩村庄被淹没于洪流冰块之中。东阿、寿张等沿河各县人民，成夜奔上黄河，冒着对岸蒋家匪帮之扫射，奋勇打冰，使被阻洪水下流。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】突然到来之冬季大泛，于十九日后天气稍暖，水位最高之东阿、魏山一带已开始下降一半。
