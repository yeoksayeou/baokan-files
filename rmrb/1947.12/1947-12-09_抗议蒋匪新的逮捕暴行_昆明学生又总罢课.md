　　Protesting Chiang Kai-shek Bandits' New Arrest Atrocities
  　Kunming Students Stage Another General Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 7th: TASS, Shanghai, December 5th: On the second anniversary of the great "December 1st" student movement, all major middle schools in Kunming held a general strike to protest the recent arrest of three students by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in Kunming, acting on secret orders from Nanjing (it is reported that those arrested this time included more than twenty people, including teachers, staff, and bank employees, in addition to students). This is another great action by Kunming students following the general strike that began on the 6th of last month, marking the continued upsurge of the student movement against oppression and for freedom in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. On December 1, two years ago, Kunming students, in their movement against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' civil war, saw the four martyrs Yu Zai, Pan Yan, Zhang Huachang, and Li Lulian brutally murdered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and more than thirty students were injured. In their vigorous struggle, Kunming students powerfully exposed Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to carry out an anti-people civil war for the first time, profoundly educating the people of the whole country to heighten their vigilance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 7th: Comprehensive reports from Shanghai and Tianjin: The student movement against oppression and for freedom in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas in mid-last month was of grand scale. In addition to those previously reported, the schools involved in the strike included Shanghai China Industrial and Commercial College, Shanghai Law School, Soochow University, Jinan University, Kindergarten Teachers College, Tongji University, and Tongji Vocational School. Nanjing Ginling Women's University, Beiping Sino-French University, Chaoyang University, Tianjin and other schools were also involved. During the strike, the schools successively issued letters to teachers, students, and fellow countrymen, denouncing the executioner Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of arresting and slaughtering students in various places, held memorial services for martyr Yu Zisan, raised donations for Yu's family, and sent telegrams to support the just demands of Zhejiang University students. More than 20,000 students from more than 30 middle schools in Kunming went on a general strike from the 6th, which had not stopped by the 14th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities dissolved the Yunnan University Student Self-Government Association, arrested active members of the student movement in various schools, pressured students' parents to take their children back home, and even threatened to dissolve the schools, but still failed to curb the students' heroic struggle. More than 20,000 students shouted resolute slogans such as "We will never stop until we achieve our goal" in demonstrations demanding the release of the arrested students. When Nanjing Central University, Ginling Women's University, and other schools voted on whether to strike, the vast majority overwhelmed the clamor of the Chiang Kai-shek special agents and the Three Youth League to obstruct the strike. During the Jiaotong University strike, the conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to set fire with kerosene was exposed. During the Tongji University strike, the bell was rung twelve times at noon to show protest, and a vegetarian meal was eaten in mourning. At Fudan University, slogans, banners, and cartoons protesting the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were posted everywhere. On the morning of the 10th, all students paraded around the campus plaza in formation for three weeks, shouting tragic slogans such as "Guarantee Human Rights." Various schools in Beiping and Tianjin successively established "Human Rights Protection Committees." Tsinghua University held an "Accusation Meeting" on the 5th, and Nankai University held "Anti-Persecution Evening Parties" on the 6th and 9th, performing dramas such as "Unity is Strength," "Teahouse Serenade," and "Yu Zisan's Murder," denouncing the bloody crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Teachers and students actively attended, with more than a thousand people attending each time.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 7th: Comprehensive reports from Chiang Kai-shek controlled newspapers: Students in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are suffering extremely in the severe winter, and some have even committed suicide due to poverty and illness. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on the 12th of last month: Liu Xiuqing, a fourth-year student in the Department of Civil Engineering at Tangshan Institute of Technology, hanged himself from a large tree on the side of the institute's sports field on the morning of the 10th of last month. The student had been suffering from hemoptysis due to lung disease two months prior, and after diagnosis by Kailuan Hospital, it was believed that he would not recover without long-term recuperation. However, his family was poor, and his livelihood became a problem after suspending his studies, let alone recuperation. Recently, due to the arrival of severe winter, he was forced to commit suicide in anger due to poverty and illness. The students of the same grade in the department suspended classes for a day to express their condolences and arranged his funeral.
    Publicly funded students at Nankai University in Tianjin receive only 280,000 yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency per month, which, after deducting the school's loans, is not enough to pay for the "economic meal group" meals, and they are forced to sell books, leather shoes, bicycles, etc. Self-funded students are even more worried and cannot pay their meal fees. Students at the Nanjing Conservatory of Music wrote "Dining Committee is Pressing for Debt" on advertisements selling clothes, and below it was drawn a bare-chested student holding a shirt, coat, etc. in a begging pose. Students at the Central University Teachers College used "The wind is rustling, the body is cold, the clothes are tattered, and there is no money" as the title, calling for an increase in this year's winter clothing and pocket money according to the current price situation, and for it to be issued as soon as possible.

　　抗议蒋匪新的逮捕暴行
  　昆明学生又总罢课
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社沪五日讯：伟大的“一二、一”学生运动两周年，昆明全市各大中学因最近昆明蒋匪当局奉南京密令又逮捕学生三人（据悉此次被捕者除学生外，尚有教职员和银行职员等二十余人），特举行总罢课，抗议此一暴行。按此为昆明学生继上月六日起总罢课后的另一伟大行动，标志着蒋管区学生反压迫、争自由运动的继续高涨。前年十二月一日，昆明学生在反对蒋匪内战运动中，于再、潘琰、张华昌、李鲁连四烈士横遭蒋匪杀害，三十余学生受伤。昆明学生在其轰轰烈烈斗争中，首次有力的暴露了蒋介石进行反人民内战的阴谋，深刻的教育了全国人民提高警惕。
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合沪津报讯：上月中旬蒋管区学生反压迫争自由正义运动规模壮阔，卷入罢课斗争中学校除以前报导者外，尚有上海中华工商专科学校、上海法学院、东吴、暨南、幼专、同济及同济高职。南京金陵女大、北平中法、朝阳、天津等校。罢课期间，各校纷纷发表告师长同学书、告全国同胞书，控诉刽子手蒋介石在各地逮捕屠杀学生罪行，举行于子三烈士追悼会，为于烈士家属募捐，通电支持浙大同学正义要求。昆明三十余大中学二万余学生，由六日起，总罢课至十四日仍未停止。蒋匪当局解散云大学生自治会，逮捕各校学运积极分子，压迫学生家长领回子弟，甚至以解散学校相威胁，仍未能遏止学生的英勇斗争。二万余学生在要求释放被捕同学的示威游行中，曾喊出“不达目的誓不休止”等坚决口号。南京中大、金陵女大等校投票表决罢课时，均以绝大多数压倒蒋特三青团阻挠罢课的叫嚣。交大罢课时曾揭露蒋特以煤油纵火的阴谋。同济罢课时，中午鸣钟十二下以示抗议，并素食一餐致哀。复大校内遍贴抗议蒋匪暴行的口号标语漫画，十日上午，全校学生在校内广场上列队游行三周，高呼“保障人权”等悲壮口号。平津各校纷纷成立“人权保障委员会”，清华曾于五日举行“控诉会”，南开于六日九日两度举行“反迫害晚会”，演出“团结就是力量”、“茶馆小调”、“于子三被害”等戏剧，控诉蒋匪血腥罪恶，教职员学生均踊跃到会，每次在千人以上。
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合蒋区报纸讯：严冬中蒋区学生困苦异常，甚至有因贫病交迫而自杀者。据上月十二日津益世报报导：唐山工学院土木工程系四年级学生刘秀清，上月十日晨吊死于该院运动场侧大树上，该生两月前即患肺病咯血，经开滦医院诊断，认为非长期疗养则无痊愈希望。但他家境穷困，休学后生活即成问题，更谈不上疗养。近因严冬降临，贫病交迫，乃愤而自杀。该系同级学生停课一天致哀，并为其料理后事。
    天津南开大学公费生，每月仅得蒋币二十八万元，扣除校方贷款后，即不足缴纳“经济饭团”膳费，被迫纷纷将书籍、皮鞋、自行车等出售。自费生更愁眉苦脸，交不出膳费。南京音专学生在出售衣物的广告上，写着“伙食委员逼债”，下面则画着一赤膊学生手持衬衫、外衣等作求售状。中央大学师院学生以“风萧萧兮身上寒，衣破烂兮苦无钱，”作标题，呼吁按现在物价情状增加本年度寒衣费及零用费，并从速发给。
