    The Taihang Third Special District Joint Work Group Goes to Various Counties
    Reversing Cadre Waiting Mentality
    Fully Leading Winter Production
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] Following the Third Special District Administrative Office’s renewed call for "rapidly organizing winter production" based on the district's situation, a meeting was convened on the first of this month with all comrades from the Special District Administrative Office, the Finance Office, and the bank who were working in the countryside. After three days of reporting, discussion, and research, it was clarified that the key to the decline of the winter production movement and how to quickly launch it lies in reversing the cadre waiting mentality, mobilizing all cadres, and fully leading winter production. In order to more powerfully launch the movement quickly, it was decided that the Third Prefectural Committee, the Third Special District Administrative Office, the Finance Office, the Jinnan Bank Sub-branch, and the Industry and Commerce Bureau, in addition to retaining necessary personnel to maintain the work of the agencies, would extract thirty-three people to form a joint work group. On the fifth of this month, they departed for various counties, with a focus on Lucheng and Changzhi. The allocation of forces is as follows: Changzhi, eight people; Lucheng and Huguan, six people each; Pingshun, six people; Licheng, five people; Changshi, two people. All section chiefs of the Special District Administrative Office's Civil Affairs, Education, and Construction departments were dispatched. The main task of going to the countryside this time is to implement the previous call, reverse the cadre waiting mentality, mobilize all cadres, fully lead winter production, and practically go deep among the masses to conduct specific organization, in order to achieve significant results in a very short period of time.
