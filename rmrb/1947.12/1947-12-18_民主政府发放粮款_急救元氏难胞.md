    Democratic Government Distributes Grain and Funds
    Emergency Relief for Yuanshi Refugees
    [This Newspaper Reports] After the liberation of Yuanshi, the democratic government immediately allocated 195 shi of emergency relief grain to aid the disaster-stricken masses in the urban area. A large number of hungry people in the urban area, who had long suffered from the oppression of the bandit Wei, went to the grain distribution points in various streets to receive it. As of the 9th, 156 shi, 9 dou, and 5 sheng of grain had been distributed, providing relief to 335 impoverished families and 1,210 people who were in immediate need of food and drink. Relief efforts are continuing. Our banks and industrial and commercial departments have provided loans and grain to support small vendors and peddlers. The Farmers' Cooperative, in order to regulate daily food supplies, has specially transported 2,000 jin of edible salt, 500 jin of sesame oil, and over 30,000 jin of cabbage for sale. At the same time, to solve the problem of currency shortage, it is also permitted to exchange goods such as cotton and grain for currency. In addition, a large number of small vendors from other places have been organized to come to the city for trade. A citizen in Dongguan was quite surprised to see our economic cadres personally going to the streets to investigate. He said, "The people from their (referring to the enemy) cooperatives and banks all wore fine clothes and ate several dishes per meal. Now that our people have come, they eat millet and wear coarse cloth, and even personally conduct investigations. It is truly a change of times!" Under our support, small vendors and peddlers have resumed business one after another. As of the 9th, 23 businesses had started operating, and other merchants are preparing to open. It has also been decided to restore the city market on December 11th (October 29th of the lunar calendar), and a celebration meeting for the liberation of the entire county will be held.
    Furthermore: After the liberation of the county seat, most of the faculty and staff of six schools in the city, including Chengcheng Elementary School, Women's Elementary School, and Simple Teachers' School, have remained in the city. Currently, the faculty, staff, and students remaining at the schools are cleaning classrooms and school sites and arranging desks and chairs. Formal resumption of classes is expected within days.

    民主政府发放粮款
    急救元氏难胞
    【本报讯】元氏解放后，民主政府当即拨发紧急救济粮一百九十五石，救济城关被难群众。久受魏匪压榨的城关大批饥民，前往各街放粮处领取。至九日止已放粮一百五十六石九斗五升，救济了当下就没吃喝的贫苦难民三百三十五家，一千二百一十人。现正在继续救济。我银行及工商部门贷款贷粮，扶助小商摊贩，农民联合社为调剂日用食品，特运来食盐二千斤、香油五百斤、白菜三万余斤出售，同时为解决货币缺少困难，还准以棉粮等兑货，此外并组织大批外地小商进城买卖。东关一市民对我经济干部亲自下街查访颇为惊讶，他说：“人家（指敌人）合作社、银行的人穿的都是好衣服，吃的都是几个盘几个碗，现在咱们人来了，吃小米穿粗布，还亲自查访，可见天啦。”在我扶植下之小商摊贩，纷纷复业，至九日已有二十三家开始营业，其他商户正准备开张。又决定十二月十一日（旧历十月二十九日）恢复城里集市，并将召开庆祝全县解放大会。
    又讯：县城解放后，城里成城高小、女子高小及简师等六座学校，教职员大部留城，现在留校教职员及同学正清扫课堂、校址，安排桌凳，日内即可正式复课。
