    Chang Le Village Cooperative Urgently Needs Reform
    ·Yan Fu, Liang Kai·
    The Chang Le Cooperative in She County was previously considered a model. It emerged during the 1942 famine, organizing the masses to produce and overcome the disaster, which gained the support of the masses. However, after the summer harvest of 1945, the cooperative began to move towards a path of simply engaging in buying and selling for profit. In the spring of 1946, the county cooperative conference criticized the practice of specializing in business for profit and proposed organizing mass production. The manager, Shi Bu Song, did not truly accept the spirit of "organizing mass production," thinking that the cooperative should directly engage in it. Coupled with the emphasis on large-scale development by the leadership at the time, which coincided with Shi Bu Song's idea of vigorous action, eleven business units such as flour mills and mat workshops were immediately established. Twenty-six cadres (mostly rich peasants, landlords, and merchants) who had detached themselves from production were hired. Over one million yuan in shares were mobilized, implementing decentralized production, unified leadership, and unified profit distribution. Workers in each workshop adopted a wage system, and except for the textile factory, they were in a purely buying and selling relationship with the masses. Due to high expenses and limited capital, the result was either a lack of raw materials or a shortage of capital. However, in order to take care of profit distribution, they had to busy themselves with their own business operations. The turned-over masses requested the organization of transportation and joint purchase of donkeys; women who had not joined the textile factory requested support for tools and raw materials; the carpenter Fan Tian Yuan wanted to teach the cooperative how to foster small-scale cooperatives, but the cooperative did not have time to do these tasks. Sometimes the cooperative would only hire mass labor to deliver goods when it needed to promote sales. When mountain products came down, the cooperative simply used a buying and selling relationship to collect them, but there was still a phenomenon of control (such as requiring outsiders to go through the cooperative to buy). Although there were three small cooperatives in the village, they did not interact with the village cooperative, and even less was there any talk of integrating agriculture and sideline occupations. As the poor and hired laborers reflected, "The cooperative has set up a large number of stalls and hidden a group of landlords and rich peasants. It is hanging in mid-air itself, how can it seek benefits for us?"
    From the perspective of share capital, when expanding the share capital, all were monetary shares, without labor creating shares or labor joining the shares. There were also very few in-kind shares, which disadvantaged the poor and hired laborers. According to statistics during the land reform, 65 landlord and rich peasant households still owned 413,540 yuan in shares, accounting for more than 15% of the total share capital. Eighty-five middle peasant households had 438,732 yuan in shares, accounting for 16%. The 163 poor peasant households (including new middle peasants) only had 505,321 yuan in shares, accounting for 18%. Public assets and cadres from other villages accounted for 3.88%, while the undistributed fruits of struggle had shares of 1,261,158 yuan, accounting for more than 46%. If calculated based on the period before the struggle, the shares of landlords and rich peasants would equal 15% plus 46%, totaling 61%. Landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for one-fifth of the village's population, actually held 61% of the shares, while the poor peasant class, which accounted for more than half of the population, held less than one-fifth of the shares. From the perspective of the demands of each class, Chang Le is a village with a relatively concentrated population of landlords and rich peasants. Before the land reform, the demands of the landlords and rich peasants were to find outlets for their surplus agricultural products, mountain goods, and special productions of the village (water mills, reed mats) through the cooperative, absorbing labor from other villages and hiring labor from this village after labor processing. Regarding profit sharing, it was unfavorable to the poor and hired laborers. The poor and hired laborers demanded that capital serve labor, labor and capital share profits in production, and solve their production difficulties (such as livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, and household utensils). The following facts can illustrate that the poor and hired laborers suffered losses: 1. The water mill was of greatest interest to the masses. It was stipulated that non-members would be charged at market prices for grinding, while members would receive a one-third discount. From the last calculation, landlord and rich peasant members ground 11,360 jin, saving 17,040 yuan compared to market prices, while poor and hired laborer members only ground 11,921 jin, saving 17,881.5 yuan. The natural water conservancy shared by the whole village was largely seized by the rich peasants and landlords, who accounted for a small population. 2. The mountain goods department nominally took care of the poor and hired laborers by buying their goods first when the mountain goods came down; in reality, the prices started low and later rose high, so the landlords and rich peasants sold their large quantities of mountain goods later and got a higher price. Taking the price of daylilies as an example, the landlords and rich peasants averaged 338 yuan per jin, while the poor and hired laborers averaged 316.9 yuan per jin. 3. During the review this spring, the cooperative, under the guise of taking care of the poor and hired laborers, established a credit department and absorbed the 1,261,158 yuan of the fruits of struggle shares into the cooperative. As a result, the poor and hired laborers did not receive loans, but the funds were dispersed among the cooperative's various units for a long time.
    From the current leadership perspective, although Shi Bu Song (poor and hired laborer) is the chairman, the chief accountant Xu Kai actually holds the real power. Among the twenty-six cadres, sixteen are landlords and rich peasants. They often treat the peasants harshly. For example, Zhang Wei, the accountant of the flour mill, is a landlord, and when the poor peasant Li San Dan went to the flour mill to sell water caltrops, he suffered great humiliation from him. The Chang Le Village cooperative urgently needs reform. In terms of methods, the opinions of the poor and hired laborers should be listened to, and everything should be viewed from the perspective of the demands of the poor and hired laborers. Otherwise, the cooperative cannot achieve the purpose of serving the masses.

    常乐村合作社急须改造
    ·阎甫、梁楷·
    涉县常乐合作社，过去认为是比较模范的。该社是在四二年灾荒中生长起来的，组织群众生产渡荒，曾得到群众拥护。但在四五年夏收后，合作社即开始走向单纯作买卖赚钱的道路。四六年春县合作会议批判了专门经商营利，提出了组织群众生产。经理石步嵩，没有真正接受了“组织群众生产”的精神，认为是合作社直接经营来干，加之当时整个领导上强调大发展，正与石步嵩的大干思想吻合，一下就成立了粉坊、席庄等十一个经营单位，聘选了二十六个脱离生产干部（富农地主商人多），分头动员了一百余万元股金，实行分部生产，统一领导、统一分红。各作坊工人采取雇用工资制，除纺织厂外，均和群众完全是买卖关系，因开支大，资金小，结果形成不是没有原料，就是缺资本。但又要照顾分红，所以不得不忙于自己经营生产。翻身群众要求组织运输及合伙买驴；未参加纺织厂的妇女，要求扶植工具原料；木匠范天元想教合作社扶植搞小型社，合作社却没有顾得做这些工作。有时合作社要推销货，才雇用群众劳力送一下。山货下来，合作社只是单纯用买卖关系收一下，但还有统制现象（如外村来买要通过合作社）。村里虽有三个小型社，但与村社不相往来，至于农副业结合更谈不到，正如贫雇的反映说：“合作社摆下一大堆摊子，藏下一伙地主富农，它自己已吊在半空，还能给咱谋利益？”
    从股金上看，在扩大股金时都是货币股金，没有劳力创造股金和劳力入股，实物入股也很少，使贫雇吃亏不少。据土改中统计：地主富农六十五户，仍拥有股金四一三、五四○元，占全股金百分之十五强。中农八十五户，股金四三八、七三二元，占百分之十六。贫农一百六十三户（内有新中农）股金才有五○五、三二一元，占百分之十八。公产和外村干部占百分之三．八八，而未分之斗争果实股金一、二六一、一五八元，占百分之四十六强，如果按斗争前算，富农地主股金等于百分之十五加四十六，为百分之六十一，占全村户口五分之一的富农地主，却占了股金百分之六十一；占一半多户口的贫农层，占股金不到五分之一。从各阶层要求看，常乐是一个地主富农较集中的村子，土改前地主富农的要求是将他们的剩余农产品、山货及本村的特种生产（水磨、苇席）等，通过合作社，吸收外村劳力与雇用本村劳力，经过劳动加工找出路。关于股金分红，是于贫雇不利的，贫雇是要求资金服务劳力，劳资分红生产，解决他们生产困难（如牲畜、农具、肥料、以及建家的用具）。下面的事实就可说明贫雇是吃了亏：一、水磨是群众最感趣兴的，在磨面上规定非社员按市价，社员减少三分之一。从去年一次计，地主富农社员磨了一一、三六○斤，较市价省洋一七、○四○元，贫雇社员也仅是一一、九二一斤，省洋一七八、八一．五元。全村共享有的自然水利，占人口少的富农地主，竟攫取了大部分。二、山货部在山货下来时，名义上是照顾贫雇，先买贫雇货；实际物价开始小后来大，地主富农大宗山货卖的晚，得大价。拿黄花菜价看，地主富农平均每斤三三八元，贫雇平均每斤三一六．九元。三、今春复查时，合作社借照顾贫雇贷款为名，成立信用部，将斗出果实股金一、二六一、一五八元，吸收到合作社，结果贫雇也没贷上款，而是长期分散在合作社各单位。
    从现在的领导上看，石步嵩（贫雇）虽然是社长，但实际上是总会计许楷握有实权，二十六个干部中，富农地主占了十六个。他们时常刻薄农民，如粉坊会计张伟的是个地主，当贫农李三旦到粉坊卖玉菱时，就受了他很大的欺侮。常乐村的合作社急需改造，方法上要听取贫雇意见，一切从贫雇要求着眼，否则，合作社是不能达到为群众服务的目的。
