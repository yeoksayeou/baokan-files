Julu County, Xiaohan Yan Village
Accounting Drives Textile Production

[This newspaper, Julu County] The Xiaohan Yan Village in the Third District held a women's congress on November 1st to study textile production. The village has 94 women spinners. Each woman can earn 225 yuan per day by spinning four liang of yarn. The village calculates that they can earn 21,150 yuan per day. Calculated over 60 days until the end of the lunar year, they can earn 1,269,000 yuan, which can buy 105 shi, 7 dou, and 5 sheng of grain (not including woven cloth). This concrete accounting method boosted the enthusiasm of women for textile production. Women freely formed groups and began digging underground textile cellars to spin and weave cloth to overcome the famine. Now, the women in the village are competing to spin and weave day and night.

[This newspaper, Gaoyi County] In Xiguan, Gaoyi County, poor hired women Wang Qiaoping, Yang Xiuhua, and six others voluntarily formed a textile group. The group includes one elderly woman and one middle-aged woman, with the rest being young women. After organizing, they pooled their capital, bought six jin of cotton, and collectively bought one jin of sesame oil to start spinning. They spin industriously until after 12 o'clock every night. In addition to helping each other with lamp oil, they also collectively invest in buying cotton. After the yarn is spun, they sell it at the market in the name of the group. They have also made a textile plan. Now, they spin from 5:30 PM to 12:00 AM every night, with each person spinning six liang of yarn per night. Preliminary calculations show a net profit of 12,000 yuan after deducting capital. Eight people spinning together save 14 liang of oil per night. The plan is to distribute work according to ability and distribute dividends accordingly. A method for dividing profits between families and spinners has been established: families provide capital for women's textile production, and of the profits earned by women in textile production, families receive 70% and spinners receive 30%. In addition to continuing to spin yarn, the group is preparing looms and digging underground cellars. The plan is for all the spinners in the group to learn to weave cloth (one woman in the group can already weave).

    算帐推动纺织
    【本报巨鹿讯】三区小韩岩村，十一月一日召开全村妇女大会，研究纺织，全村纺妇九十四人，每人每天纺四两能获利二百二十五元，全村计算每天获利二万一千一百五十元，按到阴历年底六十天计算，能获利一百二十六万九千元，能买谷子一百零五石七斗五升（织成布不在内）。这样以具体算帐，提高妇女纺织情绪，随自由结合小组，纷纷刨纺织窨子，以纺花织布渡灾荒。现下该村妇女，不分昼夜，争先恐后的纺织。

    【本报高邑讯】高邑西关贫雇妇女王巧平、杨秀华等八人，自愿结成了纺织组，小组内除一个老娘一个中年外，其余都是些青年妇女，在组织起来后，她们大伙凑了资本买了六斤棉花，集体打油一斤，开始了纺线。每夜纺到十二点以后，纺的很起劲，她们除灯油互助外，还集体集股买花，纺成线后以小组名义到集上去卖，她们又作了纺织计划，现在每晚从下午五点半一直纺到十二点，每人每夜纺线六两。初步总结除资本外，净赚洋一万二千元，八个人在一块纺每夜能省油十四两。计划今后要按活定分，按分分红。现已订出家庭与纺妇的分红办法，家庭供给妇女纺织资本，妇女在纺织中赚下的红利，家庭分七、纺妇分三。该组现在除坚持纺线外，正收拾织布机、打地窨子，今后计划全组纺妇都要学会织布（组内现有一个妇女会织）。
