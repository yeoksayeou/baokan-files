　　The Hearts of the Poor Cannot Be Robbed
　　Stories of Soldiers and Civilians Behind Enemy Lines
　　Chen Yamin

　　A unit of the East China Field Army was ordered to enter the enemy-occupied areas of southern Shandong to fight. One night, they marched in the rain to ×× village, only three miles from the enemy stronghold, to set up camp. Originally, the people here, regardless of day or night, always hid in the mountains and valleys, living in terror. This night, because of the rain, they had to return to their empty houses, which had been looted by the Chiang bandits more than once, with fearful hearts, praying that they would not be robbed again tonight!

　　Suddenly, the sound of knocking on the door woke them from their sleep. A kind of inexplicable fear immediately struck everyone's heart, but no one dared to utter a sound.

　　The People's Liberation Army soldiers shouted for a long time, but no one opened the door. The hot-tempered Lei Hongsheng got angry again, and kicked the door twice with a thud, and shouted a few more times. Finally, the door of a two-room thatched hut was opened. The room was pitch black, and nothing could be seen. Only an old woman could be heard shivering.

　　"Where's the lamp? Get one!" the hot-tempered soldier said, his voice still a bit rough.

　　"There isn't any, sir."

　　"None? Don't you light lamps in your house? What a joke!"

　　Deputy squad leader Lao Chen quickly stopped him, saying, "Hothead, what are you doing? If there's no lamp, can't we use a candle?" Then he comforted the old woman, "Don't be afraid, granny, we are the Eighth Route Army, and we're back again."

　　The old woman was still shivering, not uttering a word.

　　The hot-tempered soldier lit the candle. "Granny, do you have a basin for washing your feet?" As he said this, he looked around the house, but there was nothing. Even the pot on the stove was gone. "Where's your pot?"

　　"Sir, what are you saying? I don't understand..." The old woman shivered even more, her voice trembling.

　　The hot-tempered soldier was really furious, and simply started cursing, "Damn it, I've only been gone for a few months, and you've already changed your heart!" As he said this, he raised his right foot half a foot in front of the old woman. "Look, we climb mountains barefoot, dozens of miles a day, and have to fight. Who is it for!"

　　Everyone in the squad was surprised to see this. Why was the old woman so afraid of them? Lao Chen felt that there was something wrong here, and once again warned Lei Hongsheng, "If there's no basin, forget it. Don't you dare nag anymore. Look how scared the granny is of us!"

　　No one said anything more. They just tidied up a bit and lay down haphazardly.

　　The old woman didn't utter a sound or move, just staring at everyone. Lao Chen urged her to sleep, but she didn't seem to hear.

　　After a while, the old woman suddenly walked towards the east wall of the room—where rain-soaked military caps, uniforms, and food bags were hanging. She first carefully looked at the military caps, and then repeatedly touched them with her hands. She discovered that these were not "big pancake" (note) hats; then she looked at the uniforms, pulling open the backs of the uniforms, and none of them had "small slits" (note). At this moment, as if realizing something, she suddenly turned around and knelt down in front of Lao Chen, crying and saying, "I lied to you, comrades! I'm sorry, I treated you comrades as reactionaries! Comrades, please don't be angry, I'm just old and confused..."

　　Everyone sat up. The hot-tempered soldier was also very surprised. The old woman continued to sob:

　　"Comrades, we've suffered so much since you left. That vicious-hearted Wang Xiazi has seized our land again, and is even trying to collect rent. And those merciless soldiers come to rob us every day, abusing people, even stealing the dozens of corn cobs we had saved for planting. This afternoon, they even snatched my daughter-in-law. I knelt down and kowtowed, but those devils showed no mercy. I couldn't stop them, and only managed to grab a handful of my daughter-in-law's hair..."

　　She took out a handful of messy hair from her bosom and continued to cry. Everyone was stunned by her words.

　　"Comrades, my son is also in the Eighth Route Army. I always go to the back ridge every day, hoping to see our people come back! Hoping to see my son come back! But I always see nothing..."

　　"Granny, haven't we come back now? Our return is the same as your son's return. We will avenge you and give you satisfaction!" Lao Chen said, everyone with a serious expression. The hot-tempered soldier regretted that he had been suspicious just now, but his heart was now filled with anger, and he tightly gripped the handle of the grenade beside him.

　　Early the next morning, the troops gathered on the big threshing ground in the east of the village, surrounded by crowds of people seeing them off. An old man in his sixties walked out of the crowd and said, "Chiang Kai-shek's troops robbed us of our grain, clothes, livestock, and even snatched away our young men and women, but they can't rob us poor people of our red hearts! Our poor people's hearts are always with the Eighth Route Army comrades. Now that you comrades have returned, we poor folks can reclaim our land and homes."

　　After the troops shouted slogans to support the poor brothers and elders, they set off. But the old woman hurriedly caught up, holding a pair of new shoes in her hand, and found the hot-tempered soldier, saying, "These were made by my daughter-in-law for my son. My son went north, and I can't send them to him. I hid them in the cellar; now I'm giving them to you to wear, go and fight the reactionaries! Anyway, wearing them for you is the same as wearing them for my son."

　　The hot-tempered soldier gratefully put on the shoes. The old woman hugged the hot-tempered soldier tightly, reluctant to let him go. Only when the troops had gone far away did the hot-tempered soldier suddenly move and say repeatedly as he walked, "Granny, we will never forget you, we will definitely come back!"

(Note) "Big pancake" and "small slits" refer to the military caps and uniforms worn by the Chiang Kai-shek army.

　　穷人的心是抢不走的
    蒋后军民故事
    陈桠民
    华东解放军某部奉命要进入鲁南蒋后作战，一天夜里，冒雨开到离敌据点只三里的××村宿营。原来这里的人们在平时不分黑夜白天，总是躲藏在山岭上和山凹里，过着恐怖的生活；这天夜里因为下着雨，只好伴着恐惧的心情回到被蒋匪抢掠不只一次的空屋子里来，心里都在祈祷着今晚上可不再遭劫了！
    突然，外面的叫门声把他们从睡梦里惊醒了，一种莫名的惊恐又立刻袭上每个人的心头，但是谁也不敢哼一声。
    解放军战士喊了大半天，没有一家开门的，暴性子雷洪生火劲又上来了，通通通通向门上踢了两脚，又喊了几声，一座两间茅屋的门算是开了，屋里是黑洞洞的，啥也看不见，只听着一位老大娘正在打哆嗦。
    “灯呢？弄一盏来！”暴性子的话声仍有些粗硬。
    “没有啊！先生。”
    “没有？你家还不点灯吗？笑话！”
    副班长老陈赶紧制止道：“暴性子，你干什么呀？没有灯点洋蜡不行吗？”随又安慰老大娘说：“不要怕，大娘，咱们是八路呀，又打回来了。”
    老大娘还是打哆嗦，一哼不哼。
    暴性子点上洋蜡。“大娘，洗脚有盆子吗？”说着，把房子照了一遍，啥也没有，灶上的锅也不见了，“你家的锅呢？”
    “先生，你说啥？俺不懂……”老大娘哆嗦打得更紧，话声也是那么颤声颤气的。
    暴性子真气极了，索性大骂起来：“妈的，老子才走了几个月，你就变心了！”说着把右脚向老大娘面前跷起半人高，“你看，咱光着脚爬山，一天几十里还得打仗，为的谁！”
    全班的人见这种情形，都觉得奇怪。老大娘为什么这样怕我们呢？老陈更觉得这里面有问题，再一次警告雷洪生说：“没有盆子就算了，不许你在罗嗦，你看大娘怪怕我们呢！”
    大家谁也没有再说什么，随便收拾了一下，就东倒西歪的躺下了。
    老大娘不哼声，也不走动，只是盯着大家看，老陈催她去睡，她好象没听到似的。
    过了一会儿，老大娘突然向着屋东墙走去——这里挂满了雨湿的军帽、军衣和饭包。她先细细看了看军帽，又反复用手摸着，她发现这并不是“大烧饼”（注）帽子；再看看军衣，拉开军衣的背后面，一件件都不是开过“小岔”（注）的。这时，她象有所悟似的，猛然转回身来跪倒在老陈面前，一面痛哭一面说道：“我骗了你们了，同志！我对不起你们，我把同志们当做反动派了呢；同志一请不要生气呀，是我年老糊涂了………”
    大家都坐起来，暴性子也觉得很意外，老大娘继续着哭诉：
    “同志，你们走了，俺可苦啦，毒心肠的王瞎子，又把咱的地给霸占了，还要追缴租粮；丧天良的遭殃军也天天来抢东西，糟蹋人，把俺做种的几十个棒子穗也抢走了，今天下午又抢走了俺媳妇，俺跪下来磕头，那些东西不留一点情，俺阻挡不住，就只抢到俺媳妇的一把乱头发……”
    她从怀里掏出一把乱发，仍在痛哭着，大家被她的话呆住了。
    “同志，俺儿也在八路，我天天总是到后岭去，望望咱的人打回来了没有！俺儿回来了没有？可是，总是看个空……”
    “大娘，现在我们不是打回来了吗，我们打回来和你儿打回来一样，俺要给你报仇出气！”老陈说着，大家都带着严肃的脸色，暴性子后悔刚才自己猜疑错了，但马上内心里充满了愤恨，手里紧握着身旁的手榴弹柄。
    第二天清早，部队集合在村东头的大场上，周围围满了送行的人们。一位六十多岁的老大爷从人群中走出来说道：“老蒋的队伍抢走了咱的粮食、衣服、牲口、还抢走了咱的年青小伙子和妇女，可就没法抢走咱穷人一颗红的心！咱穷人的心总是向着八路同志的，现在同志们回来了，咱穷光蛋又好闹土地还家了。”
    部队喊过为穷兄弟爷们撑腰的口号后就出发了，但是老大娘又匆匆的赶上来，手里拿着一双新鞋，找着暴性子就说：“这是俺媳妇做给俺儿的，俺儿向北开了，没法送去，俺把它藏在地窖里；现在送给你穿，好好去打反动派吧！反正给你穿了和俺儿穿了是一样。”
    暴性子感激的把鞋穿在脚上，老大娘紧抱着暴性子不忍放走，直到部队走远了，暴性子才猛然动起身来一面走一面连声说：“大娘，我们决不会忘掉你们的，一定回来！”
    （注）“大烧饼”及“小岔”是蒋军穿的军帽和军衣。
