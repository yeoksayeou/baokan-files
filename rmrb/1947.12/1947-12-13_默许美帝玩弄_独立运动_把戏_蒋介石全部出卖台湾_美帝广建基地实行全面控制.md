    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th – According to reliable sources, simultaneously with selling out China's customs sovereignty, Chiang Kai-shek has decided to completely sell out Taiwan Province to U.S. imperialism as one of the conditions for obtaining U.S. aid. The method of sale is to use the "referendum" trick to turn Taiwan into a Philippines under the smoke screen of "independence" or "autonomy," effectively transferring it to the hands of the United States. The so-called "Taiwan independence movement" instigated by the United States with the tacit approval of the Chiang bandit authorities since early October is a preparatory step for this traitorous deal. Sources say that the United States has formulated a comprehensive plan to enslave the people of Taiwan militarily, economically, and politically based on the agreement with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The entry of a large number of U.S. military advisory group personnel into Taiwan in November and the announcement by the U.S. Embassy on November 22 that the U.S. Consulate in Taipei had been upgraded to a Consulate General are new steps taken to adapt to this plan. It is reported that the Taipei, Tainan, Taichung, Kaohsiung, Keelung, and Pingtung sea and air bases already controlled by the United States are being accelerated for reconstruction. American aircraft and warships have begun to use the aforementioned sea and air force bases. American aerial photography teams are also actively conducting intelligence work in Taiwan. The two to three thousand Japanese military, political, industrial, commercial, cultural, and technical personnel transported from the United States to Taiwan are carrying out work in various fields in Taiwan. They wear U.S. military uniforms, hold American firearms, carry U.S. military special certificates, drive away residents, and seize residences, acting as rulers. The important industrial and mining industries such as Taiwan Cement, Electricity, Sugar, Aluminum Factory, and Salt Industry, which have long been controlled by American capital and technology, will be greatly expanded and strengthened. The instructions made by Wedemeyer during his visit to Taiwan in August to suppress the Taiwanese people's movement are also being actively implemented by the Chiang bandit authorities.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th – The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism in collusion with the Chiang bandit authorities to instigate the so-called "Taiwan independence movement" in an attempt to completely occupy Taiwan has been confirmed by a dispatch from Taiwan by a Shanghai Xinmin Evening News reporter stationed in Taiwan. According to the Associated Press on the 4th, citing the dispatch from Shanghai, "The United States has ruled Taiwan and is completely turning it into their (referring to the United States) new colony." It pointed out that the United States is using a group of so-called "Taiwan independence movement leaders" manipulated by them to create "public opinion for trusteeship of the island." From the demand for a "national referendum" put forward by this group of leaders, "the ambition of the United States can be clearly seen." The dispatch said: "Taiwan has long fallen under the control of the United States and has become a new paradise for the United States. The U.S. Air Force has taken over the airport and put the aircraft assembly plant into operation. At the same time, the U.S. Army is building large military bases, secretly transporting large amounts of military supplies every day, which are hidden after they are transported in."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th – According to news from Taiwan: Just as Chiang Kai-shek completely sold out Taiwan to the United States, U.S. Imperialism's Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, Cooke, led his special mixed fleet to Taiwan on the 6th. After two days of inspection at the giant port of Keelung in Taiwan, he made a comprehensive "aerial inspection tour."

    默许美帝玩弄“独立运动”把戏
    蒋介石全部出卖台湾
    美帝广建基地实行全面控制
    【新华社陕北八日电】据可靠消息，与出卖中国海关主权同时，蒋介石已决定把台湾省完全出卖给美帝国主义，作为取得美国援助的条件之一。出卖方式系采用“公民投票”把戏，以便在“独立”或“自治”的烟暮下，将台湾变成菲律滨，实际上转到美国手中。十月初以来，美国在蒋匪当局默许下策动的所谓“台湾独立运动”，即系此项卖国交易之准备步骤。消息称：美国已根据与蒋介石匪帮的协议，拟定军事上经济上和政治上奴役台湾人民的全面计划，十一月间美军顾问团大批人员之进入台湾，及美国大使馆于十一月二十二日宣布台北美领事馆升格为总领事馆，即为适应此项计划所采取之新步骤。据悉：美国所已掌握之台北、台南、台中、高雄、基隆、屏东等海空基地，正在加速改建中、美国飞机军舰已开始使用上述海空军基地，美国航空摄影队，亦在台积极进行情报工作，由美国运往台湾之两三千名日本军事、政治、工商、文化及技术人员，正在台湾展开各方面工作，他们身穿美军服，手持美国枪械，携带美军特别证书，赶走居民，霸占住宅，以统治者自居。早为美国资本和技术所控制之台湾水泥、电力、糖业、铝工厂、盐业等重要工矿业，将予大事扩充和加强。魏德迈八月到台时，所作镇压台湾人民运动指示，亦正由蒋匪当局积极执行中。
    【新华社陕北八日电】美帝国主义串通蒋匪当局策动所谓“台湾独立运动”，企图完全占有台湾的阴谋，为上海新民晚报驻台记者日前自台湾发出的电讯所证实。据美联社四日自上海引述该电讯称：“美国已统治了台湾，并且正在把它彻底变为他们（指美国）的新殖民地。”指出美国正在利用为他们所操纵的一批所谓“台湾独立运动领袖”，制造一种“托管该岛的舆论”，从这批领袖所提出的“全民投票”的要求，“可以很清楚看出美国的野心”。电讯称：“台湾早已落入美国的控制之中，并已变为美国的新乐园。美国空军已经接管了机场，使飞机装配厂开工。与此同时，美国陆军已在建筑大的军事基地，每天秘密运来大量的军火，运来后就藏起来。”
    【新华社陕北八日电】据台湾消息：正当蒋匪完全出卖台湾给美国之时，美帝国主义西太平洋舰队司令柯克，于六日率其所属特种混合舰队驶抵台湾。在台湾巨港基隆作两日视察后，又作全面“空中考察旅行”。
