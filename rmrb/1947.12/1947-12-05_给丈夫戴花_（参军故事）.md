　　Giving Flowers to Her Husband
  　(A Story of Joining the Army)
    Chen Yuan
    Bi Shuqin was an eighteen-year-old young woman. After she colluded with eighteen other women to overthrow the big, evil landlord, she was elected by the farmers of Fifth Street as a hero of liberation, and she herself was completely liberated.

    When she heard about expanding the counter-offensive army, she made up her mind to send her man to join the army. Her man was only twenty-one years old this year and was a good militiaman. The two were so deeply in love that they couldn't bear to be apart for a day. When Bi Shuqin attended the county-wide meeting of liberation heroes in early September, her man came to see her every other day.

    While the district was celebrating the arrival of the counter-offensive and the expansion of the counter-offensive army with great enthusiasm, Shuqin quietly called her man away.

    "A big meeting is going on, why did you call me back?" Her man didn't know what was going on and asked as soon as he returned. Shuqin stared at her man for a long time before saying:

    "Do you think we are good together?"

    "Why are you asking this? I never said we weren't!" Her man immediately got angry, but she still slowly said:

    "I have something to say, can you listen?"

    "When have I ever said I wouldn't listen to you! Tell me, I will definitely listen."

    Her husband's heart was pounding, not knowing what Shuqin wanted to say, fearing that Shuqin would say something that couldn't be done, hurting their feelings.

    "Isn't the meeting expanding the counter-offensive army, would you like to join too?" Shuqin was afraid that her man wouldn't go, and after thinking for a long time, she reluctantly said it. After her man heard this, he laughed heartily and said, "I thought it was a big deal, it turns out you want me to join the army. Let me tell you, I was just about to discuss this with you! I am willing to go, but... if I leave, will you... miss... me?"

    "How can I not miss you, but there are still enemies in Jiaozuo, we fought the wealthy and were given things, if we can't recover Jiaozuo, we still won't have peace! Go! Let's reunite after defeating Chiang Kai-shek, what do you think..."

    "Okay, let's go to the meeting to sign up..." They went to the meeting, where the farmers were eagerly signing up. They squeezed through the crowd, went to the rostrum, and Bi Shuqin had prepared many things to say when she sent her husband to sign up. Standing at the entrance of the stage, she saw many eyes shining under the gaslight, and her face immediately flushed, and her heart started beating very fast. After a long time, she said:

    "I am from Fifth Street, my name is Bi Shuqin, I voluntarily send my man to join the army, and I also want to join the militia..."

    "We want to learn from Comrade Bi Shuqin!" The applause and slogans immediately mixed together. This applause scared away all her words, and she only felt her heart beating wildly, not knowing what to say, so she bowed and walked off the stage.

    The next day, all the women in the district presented flowers to more than two hundred new soldiers amidst the sound of delicate music. Bi Shuqin made a bright red and large flower overnight. When the chairman called for the women of Fifth Street to present flowers on the stage, Bi Shuqin took her heart flower, ran to the stage, and looked at her husband from afar. When she got closer, they looked at each other, and she hung the flower on her husband's chest...

　　给丈夫戴花
  　（参军故事）
    陈远
    毕树琴是个十八岁的青年妇女，自她串通了十八个妇女，斗倒大恶霸地主以后，就被五街的农民选成了翻身英雄，自己也彻底翻了身。
    当她听到要扩充反攻军时，自己就下了决心，要送她男人去从军，她男人今年才二十一岁，是个好民兵，两个人感情好到一天也离不开。当毕树琴于九月初参加全县翻身英雄会时，她男人每隔一天即去看她一次。
    全区庆祝反攻到来和扩大反攻军大会正在开的热烈时，树琴悄悄的把她男人叫走了。
    “正开大会，你叫我回来干什么？”她男人也不知是什么事情，回来就问。树琴盯着她男人一直看了半天才说：
    “你看咱俩好不好？”
    “你说这干什么？我也没说不好呀！”她男人立刻发了火，但她还是慢慢的说：
    “我有一句话，你能听不能？”
    “我什么时候说过不听你的话呀！你说吧，我一定听。”
    她丈夫的心在咚咚的跳，不知树琴要说啥话，怕树琴说出来办不到，伤感情。
    “大会上不是正在扩充反攻军，你也参加好不好？”树琴怕她男人不去，思索了半天才勉强的说出来。她男人听了后，就哈哈……的大笑起来说：“我以为是天大的事，原来是叫我参军，告你吧，我也正要和你商量这事哩！我是愿意去，可是……我走了你……不想……我吗？”
    “怎能不想你，可是焦作还有敌人，咱斗争了老财，分到了东西，收复不了焦作，还是不能安生呀！你去吧！打败老蒋再团圆，你看好不好……”
    “好，咱到大会上报名去，……”她俩到了大会上，会上的农民正在抢着报名，她俩从人群中挤过去，上了主席台，毕树琴还准备好了许多话；要在送她的丈夫报名时给大家说。站到台口一看，汽灯光下，照耀着许多眼睛都在瞧她，她的脸马上发了烧，心也就跟着跳起来，很大一阵才说：
    “我是五街的，叫毕树琴，自愿送我男人参军，我还要参加民兵……”
    “我们要学习毕树琴同志！”台下鼓掌和口号声，立刻混成一团，这一鼓掌把她的话，都给吓跑了，光觉心在乱跳，不知说什么好，就鞠了个躬走下台来。
    第二天全区妇女在细吹细打的音乐声中给二百余新战士献花，毕树琴连夜做了一支又红又大的鲜花，当主席台上叫五街妇女献花时，毕树琴拿着她那支心花，跑上台去远远望着她丈夫，走到跟前，两个对看了一眼，她就将花挂在她丈夫的胸前了……。
