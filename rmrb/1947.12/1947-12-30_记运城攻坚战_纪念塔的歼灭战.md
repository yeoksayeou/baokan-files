　　Record of the Yuncheng Offensive Battle
  　The Annihilation Battle at the Memorial Tower
    Wu Gang
    At dusk on the 23rd, the First Company of our 327th Battalion, along with the Sixth and Tenth Squads, under the cover of our powerful firepower, launched an attack on the "Memorial Tower" pillbox complex (seventy-odd meters from the city), one of the four major enemy outposts surrounding Yuncheng. We completely destroyed five enemy pillboxes and all secret passages. The defending enemy consisted of a platoon from the Eighth Company of the 369th Regiment, the entire Fifth Company, and over a hundred men from a special service detachment. Except for fourteen men who were captured alive by us, all the rest perished along with the tunnels under the force of our explosions. By this point, the last obstacle to our ascent into the city had been cleared, and the northern city wall was now completely exposed to our army. As soon as the battle began, under the cover of our powerful firepower, our attacking forces quickly approached the enemy and successfully blew up three rows of barbed wire. Three concealed pillboxes were also occupied by us after being blown up. At that time, the bandit army, thinking we were attacking the city, concentrated all kinds of artillery and machine guns, frantically and densely bombarding us, attempting to stop our army from advancing. Our thirty-two heroes from the Sixth Squad, braving the rain of bullets, swiftly crossed over seventy meters of open ground in ten minutes and occupied the "Memorial Tower." Liberated soldier Chen Funian (newly liberated from Jixian), stood on the tower body and surrounding walls, and raised his arms high, shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" At this time, over fifty men from the bandit army's Fifth Company, over thirty men from the special service detachment, and the remnants of a platoon and another squad from the Eighth Company, under the coercion of the bandit leaders, fired from the tunnels, making a last-ditch struggle. Our Sixth Squad and First Company immediately launched continuous explosions from the tunnel entrances and within the tunnels, and the remaining bandits perished along with the tunnels. On the other side, the two small pillboxes in the southern corner were also destroyed in a loud explosion.

    二十三日黄昏时分，我三二七大队一中队，及第六、第十两小队，在我强大火力掩护下，向运城外围敌四大阵地之一的“纪念塔”群碉（距城七十余米达），发动攻击，彻底摧毁敌五个地碉及所有暗道，守敌三六九团八连一个排，另一个机枪班及五连全部，另一个特务队百余人，除十四人被我生俘外，全部在我爆炸威力下与地道同归于尽。至此，我登城最后障碍已被扫清，北城墙已赤裸裸地暴露在我军面前。战斗一开始，在我强大火力掩护下，我攻击部队即迅速接近敌人，顺利的连续炸毁三道铁丝网，三个伏地碉亦在爆炸后为我占领。当时匪军以为我攻城，就集中所有各种炮火及机步枪，仓惶地拼命密集轰击，企图阻止我军前进，我六小队三十二位英雄，冒着弹雨，十分钟神速的越过七十余米的开阔地，占领了“纪念塔”，解放战士陈付年（吉县新解放过来的），脚踏塔身及围墙，振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”这时，匪军的五连五十余人，特务队三十余人，及八连一个排另一个班等残敌会合，在匪首威逼下从地道射击，作临死挣扎。我六小队及一中队，即从洞口、地道中展开连续爆炸，残匪当即与地道同归于尽。另一面，南角的两个小碉，也在一声巨响中炸毁。
