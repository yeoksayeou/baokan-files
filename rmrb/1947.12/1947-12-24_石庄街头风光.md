Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Jin, December 21st:

　　The citizens of Shijiazhuang and the vendors along the roadside are welcoming the people and vehicles rushing in from afar with joyful eyes. Several large carts are coming, loaded with cabbage, rice, and flour; porters are carrying eggs, peanuts, and sesame oil; fat pigs, black and white sheep, are also being driven in by the villagers. The arteries of this city and countryside have begun to connect.

　　Prices, like the red line on a thermometer, have fallen even further than before—flour has dropped to 2,300 per jin, millet has dropped to 1,300, and 1,000 yuan can buy six liang of peanuts.

　　At 6 p.m. on the afternoon of the 3rd, a large group of people suddenly appeared at the west entrance of Chaoyang Road—some running, some hurrying, some riding bicycles, constantly shouting, "Extra! Extra!" like the waves of the Yellow River rushing in.

　　There was some commotion on the street, and everyone's attention was focused on the newsboys. The good news fluttered in the crowd.

　　"Wow, Yuan氏 liberated!" someone shouted.

　　"Four thousand enemy troops annihilated!

　　Traitor Wei Yonghe has been killed!"

　　"Ah! That's great, going to Shunde (i.e., Xingtai) and Handan, there won't be any more roadblocks," said a shop assistant with a Ji'nan accent. "It's time to do some good business," a boss-like person added.

　　The next day the streets were even more lively. Advertisements for theaters such as Xin Xin and Zhonghua were posted early, and many large commercial firms also opened, with "Welcome Customers" signs posted all over the doors of major stores.

　　After noon, the stalls on Chaoyang Road, Fuxing Road, Yong'an Street, and Garden Street were even more crowded. The Yangko team of the garrison troops also appeared on the streets. A dark mass of people crowded the streets, and countless comrades in workers' clothing took their theater tickets and went to the Jianguo Hall to watch the play performed by the Frontline Theater Troupe.

　　All kinds of phenomena show that the people's city is marching towards the road of prosperity!

### 石庄街头风光

　　石庄街头风光
    石庄市民与路旁的摊贩们，用喜悦的目光在欢迎着由远处奔来的人马车辆，几辆大车过来了载着白菜、米面，挑夫担着鸡子、花生、香油；肥胖的猪，黑色白色的羊群，也被农村里的老乡们赶进来。这个城市和乡村的脉胳已开始连贯在一起了。
    物价象温度表上的红线比前更加低落了——面粉已降到二千三一斤，小米已降到一千三，花生一千元可以买到六两。
    三日下午六时，朝阳路西口，忽然出现了一大批人——有的跑，有的赶，有的骑着自行车，不住的叫：“号外！号外！”象黄河的浪头奔腾过来了。
    街上有些骚动了，大家的视线集中在报童身上，捷报翻飞在人群里了。
    “吓，解放元氏！”有人喊出来。
    “守敌四千全部就歼！
    魏逆永和已被击毙！”
    “啊！这就好了，到顺德（即邢台）邯郸去，再没有一点挡墙了。”一个冀南口音的店员说。“可该做点好买卖了。”一位老板模样的人接着说。
    第二天街上更加热闹了，新新、中华等戏院的广告，早贴出来，好些大商行也开张了，“欢迎顾客”的招牌，遍贴在各大商店的门面上。
    过午朝阳路、复兴路、永安街、花园街摊贩市场，人群更加拥挤。警备部队的秧歌队也在街头出现，黑压压的人群拥塞在街道上，无数工人服装的同志们拿着戏票，到建国堂看前线戏社演的戏了。
    各种现象显示出人民的城市，正面向繁荣的大道上迈进着！
