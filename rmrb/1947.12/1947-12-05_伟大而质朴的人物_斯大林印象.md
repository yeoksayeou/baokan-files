　　A Great and Simple Man
  　Impressions of Stalin
    Yakofulev
    Comrade Stalin, due to his responsibilities in leading the nation, needed to interact with many people. He liked new talent, liked to study them, to understand their character, who was suitable for what job, and what people were good at. Stalin often mixed sharp, humorous remarks into discussions about work.
    Once, I went to see Stalin about a problem. During the conversation, when speaking about some personnel whose work performance was not very good, Stalin casually said:
    -- They are really the Miltiades and Themistocles of the Zamoskvorechye district!
    After he said this, he looked at us to see our reaction, whether we understood the joke. I didn't fully understand, so I asked:
    -- Why the Zamoskvorechye district?
    -- Do you know who Miltiades and Themistocles are?
    -- They are two strategists from ancient Greece.
    -- Do you know what outstanding things they did?
    -- It was about something in a certain battle, but I don't know the details.
    I showed that I didn't know ancient Greek history, and I was very embarrassed at the time. On another occasion, when Stalin was criticizing certain staff members, he compared this person to a character in Chekhov's "The Wedding" novella. After he finished speaking, he suddenly asked:
    -- Do you remember this novella?
    -- I don't remember, Comrade Stalin!
    -- Haven't you read Chekhov's works?!
    -- I have read Chekhov's works many times, but I don't remember this novella.
    -- Some things should not be forgotten.
    I became embarrassed again. I originally thought I was a knowledgeable intellectual!
    Whether Stalin discussed technical issues or political issues, he always liked to cite examples from history, mythology, or classical literature that were relevant to the topic.
    He often skillfully and humorously quoted sentences from Saltykov-Shchedrin's "The History of a Town" (note), and mercilessly joked about those who still retained some of the characteristics of the protagonists in the novel.
    Once, there was a need to quickly test a new aircraft. So some "clever people" wanted to transport the aircraft to a place far away from the factory for testing, the reason being: the pilot who was to test the aircraft was there.
    Stalin said:
    -- Why transport the aircraft there? It would be much simpler for the pilot to come here. Who is doing this? Why don't you think? It's just like the "Glupov" people! Do you know how they drove the calves onto the roof of the bathhouse to graze and scattered oatmeal into the Volga River to cook porridge?
    Once, after discussing work in the office, it was late at night. Stalin invited everyone present to go back with him for dinner:
    -- That's enough for today. I don't know about others, but I'm really hungry. I'm not specifically inviting anyone, so as not to make everyone feel constrained and afraid of trouble, but anyone who wants to come with me for dinner is very welcome!
    Of course, who would refuse to have dinner with Stalin? Was this kind of invitation common?
    Everyone went back to his residence with him. When the guests arrived, the dining table was already set. Comrade Stalin's residence was simple and tidy. The books were truly abundant. Even the walls of the dining room were lined with bookcases filled with books.
    The topics of conversation during dinner were diverse: political, international, technical, literary, artistic, and so on. At this time, everyone in the conversation spoke freely and without restraint, expressing their opinions. There was no sense of superiority or inferiority or restraint – everyone was equal.
    Stalin often quoted from books. When he was extremely interested in a certain issue, he would go to the bookcase and take out the book he needed. If the topic was geography, he would take out his old map with torn edges and say:
    -- Let's take a look at my map! This map is all broken, but it can still be used.
    Stalin's remarks, at any time, were filled with literary references. His memory was truly rare – when he quoted long passages from individual works, he almost never missed a word. He especially liked the works of Gorky, Chekhov, Shchedrin, and others.
    Once, when talking about an adventure novel, the conversation turned to the works of Mayne Reid and James Fenimore Cooper. Stalin said that he loved reading the novels of these people when he was young.
    I was also fascinated by these books when I was a child, so I said to him:
    -- Yes, these books are very interesting and useful. Unfortunately, not only are there no new books of this kind being written now, but even the old ones are no longer being republished.
    Stalin smiled knowingly:
    -- Well, there isn't a single word about collective farms and tractors in the works of Mayne Reid and James Fenimore Cooper, so how can our publishing houses republish their works!
    Stalin treated people with great kindness and concern. Every time he asked someone to come to his place, he would always ask first:
    -- Are you not very busy?
    Or ask:
    -- Can you spare some time from your work to come here?
    -- Of course, Comrade Stalin!
    -- Then please come over quickly.
    In the beginning, when I was not yet the Deputy Minister of the Aviation Industry People's Commissariat, every time I left Stalin's place, he would always ask:
    -- Do you have a car?
    That is to say, if I didn't have a car, he would send a car to take me.
    Stalin often used the life and work of Lenin as an example. He liked to recall his various meetings with Lenin. Once he told the following story:
    In 1918, the Soviet government decided to move from Petrograd to Moscow. It was a tense time; the counter-revolutionary rebellions of the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks had just been suppressed in Moscow.
    -- When we first arrived in Moscow, -- Stalin said. -- Those of us who came with Lenin were very worried about his safety. When we saw that we were going to travel in an open car, we asked Lenin to sit down in the car, and we stood around him, so that he would not be seen, in order to avoid the danger of assassination. Lenin refused to agree to this method and insisted that we sit down with him. But we did not listen to him and stood in the car all the way.
    Whoever consults with Stalin on work experiences outstanding training. Every conversation with him leaves a deep impression. After each meeting, one feels that one has made great progress both politically and professionally.

    [Note] Saltykov-Shchedrin (1826-1889) was a great Russian satirical writer. In his "The History of a Town" the people referred to as "Glupov" are the residents of the town he imagined ("Glupov" comes from the Russian word "glupy," meaning stupid.)

　　伟大而质朴的人物
  　斯大林印象
    雅可福烈夫
    斯大林同志因为担负国家领导工作，需要同许多人接洽。他喜欢新人才，喜欢研究他们，知道他们的为人，什么人可以担任什么工作，以及什么人长于什么事情。斯大林在谈论工作时，往往掺杂着锋利的恢谐语句。
    有一次，我因为一个问题去见斯大林。在谈话中，说到一些工作表现不很好的人员时，斯大林竟顺便说了这么一句：
    ——真是莫斯科河外区的米太雅第和费米斯托克利哩！
    他说了以后，就注视着我们，看我们有什么反应，是否明白这句笑话，我没有完全明白，因而问道：
    ——为什么是莫斯科河外区的？
    ——您知道谁是米太雅第和费米斯克利吗？
    ——是古代希腊两个战略家。
    ——知道他们有什么出色的事情吗？
    ——是在某次战役中的事情，至于详细情形，我不清楚。
    我表现不知道古代希腊历史，我当时很害羞。还有一次，斯大林在批评某些工作人员时，他把此人与柴霍夫所著“结婚”小说中的一个人物相比较。他说完了以后，又猛然问道：
    ——记得这篇小说吗？
    ——不记得，斯大林同志！
    ——难道您没有看过柴霍夫的作品吗？！
    ——我把柴霍夫的作品看过好几遍，可是我不记得这篇小说。
    ——有些东西是不应忘记的。
    我又害羞起来。我原来觉得自己是个学识渊博的文人哩！
    斯大林谈论技术问题也好，谈论政治问题也好，总是喜欢从历史中、神话中或古典文学中引证一些合于题目的例子。
    他常常很巧妙、很诙谐的引证出谢德林所著“一个城市的历史”小说中的句子（注），并无情的说笑那些还多少保持其中主角气魄的人们。
    有一次，需要赶紧试验一种新飞机。于是就有些“聪明人”要把飞机运到离工厂很远的地方去试验，理由是：担任试验飞机的驾驶员在那里。
    斯大林道：
    ——为什么要把飞机运到那里去？驾驶员到这里来要简单得多。是谁这样办？为什么不想想呢？真是仿照“格鲁包夫”人的办法啊！知道他们是怎样把小牛赶到澡塘房顶上去吃草，把燕麦粉散到窝尔加河里煮粥吗？
    有一次，在办公厅商谈工作以后，时间已到深夜，斯大林邀请所有出席的人跟他回去吃晚饭：
    ——今天算够了吧。我不知道别人怎样，我是真饿了。我不专门请任何人，免得大家受拘束，怕麻烦，可是谁若愿意跟我去吃晚饭的话，那是很欢迎的！
    当然，谁肯拒绝同斯大林共餐？这种邀请是常有的吗？
    大家都一同跟他回住宅去了。当客人到的时候，饭厅桌上已经摆好餐具。斯大林同志的住宅，设备的俭朴、整齐。书籍真是丰富极了。甚至连饭厅的各墙壁跟前也都立着装满书籍的书柜。
    晚饭时谈话的题目是形形色色的：政治的、国际的、技术的、文学的、艺术的等等不一。这时所有对谈的人都是极自由，毫无拘束的说出自己的意见。毫无尊卑与拘束的景象——大家都是平等的。
    斯大林常从书中引证。他对某个问题极有兴趣的时候，他便走到书柜跟前，取出所需要的书来。若是谈到地理问题时，他就取出他那幅已经折损边角的旧地图来，说道：
    ——我们来看看我这张地图吧！这个地图固然全破了，可是还能应用。
    斯大林无论何时的言论，都是充满着文学引证的。他的记忆力真是罕有的——他从个别著作中摘引长段引证时，差不多一个字也遗漏不下。他特别喜欢高尔基、柴霍夫、谢德林等人的作品。
    有一次谈到了一种冒险小说，谈起了马因、里德和库伯尔的著作。斯大林说到，他幼年时很喜欢看这些人的长篇小说。
    我小的时候也是醉心于这些书籍，因而向他说道：
    ——是的，这些书都很有意思，很有用处。可惜，现在不但没有人著作这类的新书，而且连旧的也不再版了。
    斯大林俏然一笑：
    ——唔，马因、里德和库伯尔的作品中一个字也没有关于集体农庄和托拉机的事情，那我们的出版界怎能再版他们的作品呢！
    斯大林待人非常和谒关切。他每次叫人到他那里去的时候，总是先问：
    ——您不很忙吗？
    或者问：
    ——您现在能不妨碍工作到我这里来一趟吗？
    ——当然可以，斯大林同志！
    ——那就请赶快来一下。
    在初时，当我还没有当航空工业人民委员部副部长，我每次从斯大林那里走的时候，他总是问：
    ——您有汽车吗？
    这就是说，若没有汽车，他就打发汽车送我。
    斯大林常常以列宁的生活和工作做榜样。他喜欢回忆他同列宁的各次会面。有一次他讲了这样一件事情：
    在一九一八年时，苏维埃政府决定从彼得格拉迁到莫斯科来。这时很紧张，在莫斯科刚才把社会革命党和孟什维克的反革命叛乱镇压下去。
    ——当我们刚一到莫斯科时，——斯大林讲道。——我们那些与列宁一块来的人都很担心他的安全，当我们看见要乘敞汽车走的时候，就请列宁在汽车上坐下，我们围着他站着，不使他现出来，以免遭到行刺的危险。列宁怎也不肯同意这种办法，非要我们和他一同坐下不可。可是我们没有听他的话，一路都站在汽车上。
    谁与斯大林会商工作，谁就是经历卓绝的训练。同他每次的谈话都留有深刻的印象。在每次会面以后，就会觉得自己在政治上和工作上都有很大进步。

    【注】谢德林（一八二六——一八八九）是俄国的伟大讽刺作家。其所著“一个城市的历史”中有“格鲁包夫”人之称，是他所想象之城市的居民（“格鲁包夫”人是由俄文格鲁包一字而来，即愚蠢的意思。）
