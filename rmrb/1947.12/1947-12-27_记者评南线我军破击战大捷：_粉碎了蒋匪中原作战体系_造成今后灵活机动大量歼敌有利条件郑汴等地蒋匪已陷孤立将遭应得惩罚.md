　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter's Commentary on the Great Victory of Our Army's Disruptive Warfare on the Southern Front:
  　Crushing Chiang Kai-shek's Bandit's Central Plains Operational System
  　Creating Favorable Conditions for Flexible Maneuvering and Annihilating the Enemy in Large Numbers in the Future; Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits in Areas Such as Zhengzhou and Bian Is Already Isolated and Will Suffer the Punishment It Deserves
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] This agency’s reporter, in commenting on the recent great victory in the Central Plains, pointed out: The complete destruction of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has fragmented Chiang Kai-shek's bandit's Central Plains operational system, the main battlefield of the civil war, while the three major new liberated areas of Henan-Hubei-Anhui, Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, and Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei have been linked together in vast areas. This situation has created extremely favorable conditions for the People's Liberation Army to annihilate the enemy in large numbers in the future and foreshadows more and greater victories in 1948. Looking back over the past month or so, our three-pronged southern counter-offensive armies have been devoting their efforts to wiping out the local bandits and puppets in the new areas and assisting the broad masses of local people to stand up, resulting in a temporary lull in the fighting. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were frightened and bewildered by this and, seeing that the destruction of the section of the Longhai Railway east of Kaifeng had already caused them heavy blows, attempted to concentrate heavy troops to ensure the only remaining railway line in the Central Plains, the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. However, our three-pronged armies ultimately brought thunderous power and, with the speed of a fierce wind and swift lightning, launched a major disruptive war on the 13th and 14th respectively. In just three days, they had destroyed 840 miles of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway between Zhengzhou and Xinyang and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway between Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, captured 23 county towns including Xuchang, Lanfeng, Minquan, Xin Zhongmu, Chenliu, Weishi, Weichuan, Changge, Yanling, Fugou, Xinzheng, Xixian, Shangcai, Queshan, Xiping, Suiping, Linying, Tongbai, Biyang, Wuyang, Yexian, Xiangcheng, and Zaoyang, and annihilated more than 20,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The strategic strongholds of Luohe and Zhumadian in the Central Plains, which were fiercely contested in the past civil war, have also been liberated by our army. The reporter pointed out: This huge campaign is still underway. The destruction of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has not only crushed Chiang Kai-shek's bandit's Central Plains operational system but has also shattered Chiang Kai-shek's bandit's advantageous conditions for using railway transportation to maneuver. The trend of war development will further expose Chiang Kai-shek's bandit's weaknesses of being unable to attend to all matters due to insufficient troops, piecing things together, and being exhausted, thereby creating favorable conditions for our mobile and experienced field armies to annihilate the enemy on a large scale. At present, Zhengzhou, where the headquarters of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit's Army General Headquarters is located, as well as strongholds such as Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Shangqiu, have been isolated; Xinyang, another important military stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, is also exposed in front of our army, facing imminent danger. Almost the entire Central Plains is under our control, and from now on the Liberation Army can do as it pleases, either knocking on Jingpu in the east, approaching Xiangfan in the west, or crossing the Yangtze River in the south, leaving Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, who are playing "empty-city tactics," at a loss.

　　新华社记者评南线我军破击战大捷：
  　粉碎了蒋匪中原作战体系
  　造成今后灵活机动大量歼敌有利条件郑汴等地蒋匪已陷孤立将遭应得惩罚
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】本社记者在评论最近中原大捷时指出：平汉南段与陇海东段之全部破毁，已使蒋匪内战主要战场之中原作战体系为之支离破碎，而豫鄂皖、苏鲁豫皖及豫陕鄂三大新解放区则已在广大地区上联成一片。此一形势已为人民解放军今后大量歼敌创造了极为有利的条件，并预告了一九四八年度将有着更多的与更大的胜利。回顾月余以来，我三路南下反攻大军，曾以全力扫荡新区的地方匪伪，协助当地广大人民翻身，致战况沉寂一时。蒋匪曾为此惊惧惶惑，并鉴于陇海路开封以东一段之破毁已使其遭受惨重打击，妄图结集重兵确保中原残存之唯一铁路线平汉南段。但我三路大军终挟雷霆万钧之力，以疾风迅雷之势，于十三、十四两日分别发动大破击战。仅经三日，即已破毁平汉南段郑州信阳间及陇海东段开封郑州间铁道八百四十里，攻克县城许昌、兰封、民权、新中牟、陈留、尉氏、洧川、长葛、鄢陵、扶沟、新郑、息县、上蔡、确山、西平、遂平、临颍、桐柏、泌阳、舞阳、叶县、襄城、枣阳等二十三座，歼蒋匪二万余名。过去内战必争之中原战略重镇漯河及驻马店等，也已为我军解放。记者指出：此一巨大战役目下尚在开展中。平汉南段与陇海东段之破毁，不独粉碎了蒋匪中原作战体系，且使蒋匪利用铁道交通辗转机动之有利条件亦趋幻灭。而战争发展趋势，将更暴露蒋匪因兵力不足顾此失彼、东拉西凑、疲于奔命之弱点，从而为我机动灵活饱经战斗之野战军创造大规模歼敌之有利条件。目下蒋匪陆军总司令部指挥部所在地的郑州以及开封、洛阳、商邱等据点，业已陷于孤立；蒋匪另一重要军事据点信阳亦暴露在我大军阵前，朝不保夕。广大中原几全为我所控制，此后解放军已可随意所欲，或东叩京浦，或西临襄樊，或南渡长江，使玩弄“空心战术”之蒋匪无所措手足。
