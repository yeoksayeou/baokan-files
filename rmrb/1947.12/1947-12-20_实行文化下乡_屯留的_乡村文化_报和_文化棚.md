    Implementing Culture to the Countryside
    Tunliu's "Rural Culture" Newspaper and "Culture Shed"
    Sun Keming

    Since Tunliu launched its emancipation movement last year, cultural activities have also seen a leap forward, especially the creation and activity of mass folk songs, rhythmic storytelling, and dramas. However, in terms of the overall scope of cultural activities, most of it is still limited to schools, and it cannot be said that it has penetrated every corner of the countryside and into the masses; experiences have not been well exchanged, the mass creation movement has not been further universally developed, and the works that have already been created have not been promoted because there is no place to publish them. For this reason, the "Rural Culture" newspaper was specially launched and the "Culture Shed" was created at the beginning of this year. Since its implementation, it has achieved great results in half a year, and is introduced here.

    "Rural Culture" Newspaper
    In order to make culture accessible to the countryside and owned by the masses, and to exchange experiences so that the cultural life of the masses can be improved, the masses must have their own cultural garden. However, there was no experience in this regard. How to do it? In order to pool ideas and experiment, a forum was convened in the town before the new year, inviting people from the cultural and educational circles. Everyone said that they could use the lithography of the cultural bookstore to try out an irregular small newspaper, starting small and learning as they go. If it was successful, they could talk about it later. The name was "Rural Culture." Everyone agreed with this idea. At that time, it happened to be the time to organize New Year's entertainment, so the content of the first issue focused on ditties, folk songs, rhythmic storytelling, couplets, and small Yangko operas to promote New Year's entertainment. The funds were temporarily advanced by the Cultural and Educational Section and the Cultural Bookstore, and then discussed later. Half a month later, it was published during the New Year. After publication, a copy was first given to various districts, villages, agencies, and schools to solicit opinions. As a result, the feedback was very good, and many people immediately wrote contributions and expressed their determination to help it continue. Therefore, these contributions (mostly literary and artistic creations) were specially published in a small booklet of more than 50 articles for New Year's entertainment, and distributed to various villages, which immediately received a greater and more universal welcome. After the New Year, the focus was on joining the army, and "Rural Culture" then focused on reflecting the work of joining the army, which played a great role in promoting the recruitment effort. As a result, it also gained the support of government leaders, and the Political Department said: "'Rural Culture' is an indispensable thing in Tunliu, and it must not be discontinued halfway."

    Now there is no problem in continuing to run it. Therefore, the "Rural Culture" newspaper office was officially established, with Hao Jintang as the president, and Shen Zhixuan and Ji Gang, two primary school teachers, were specially responsible for editing and arranging. It was determined to be a regular seven-day publication, and the funds were donated by the Political Department, the government, and the bank to form a production fund, which was run together with the Cultural Bookstore.

    In the past six months, a total of thirty-two issues have been published. Each issue is based on the current work of the entire county to determine the central theme and small editorials, as well as major events in the liberated areas and internationally and domestically, which has played a role in promoting and leading the work. Its basic feature is to follow the mass line and truly achieve that everyone runs it and everyone reads it. There are currently more than 500 correspondents scattered in every corner of the county, reflecting mass activities everywhere at any time. In terms of language and form, it is purely vernacular, easy to understand and easy to hear. The form is mostly short and concise short articles, folk songs, and rhythmic storytelling. Longer articles are transferred to the "Yuebei People's Daily" or other newspapers and periodicals. Therefore, the correspondents said: "Don't worry if it's not used." Submitting to "Rural Culture" is equivalent to submitting to a major newspaper. In terms of layout and content, it is both all-encompassing and lively and eye-catching. There are "Hall of Glory," "Cultural Stall," "Literature and Art," "City Talk," "Mailbox," "Little Broadcast," "Reference Room," "Little Hospital," "International and Domestic News"... etc., so that everyone can find what they need and like. At present, this small newspaper is not only popular throughout the county, but also subscribed to in various counties and agencies in the Taiyue District, and village cadres from nearby counties directly send manuscripts to "Rural Culture."

    In the past six months, in addition to the above achievements and experiences, they have also compiled many books, such as "Follow the Communist Party," "Three Heroes," "How to Fight Special Agents," and "Collection of Tunliu Emancipation Experiences." In cultural activities, there are "Cultural Poker" and "Picture Literacy" booklets, and New Year pictures and cartoons have also been printed. In half a year, a total of more than 1,000 books were printed.

    Culture Shed
    In order to make the various departments of cultural activities cooperate with each other, and to combine high-level education with low-level education, "Culture Sheds," which are mobile libraries, were set up in the county theater troupes—the He and Linshan theater troupes. Inside there are various rural application books and periodicals, and there are propaganda and education activities such as drum storytelling and rhythmic storytelling. Every time they go to a performance, a special person is responsible for propaganda, selling books, talking about books, and allowing the masses to read before the performance when the audience has nothing to do. This approach has been very successful. For example, in terms of selling books, the Linshan Theater Troupe sold more than 10,000 yuan worth of books in three days when they performed in Wuyuan, which was more than the Cultural Bookstore in the city sold in seven days. In two months, they sold a total of more than 90,000 yuan. In particular, doing propaganda activities before the performance, telling rhythmic stories, and singing drum lyrics are most popular among the masses. For example, the He Theater Troupe told stories in Baodian, and more than 1,000 people listened. The Linshan Theater Troupe told big drums in Wuyuan, and more people listened than watched the show.

    In addition, within the theater troupe, the needs of everyone to read books and newspapers have also been met, the garden of cultural life has been expanded, and cultural education has been strengthened. For example, Comrade Xiao Hong of the He Theater Troupe reads books whenever he has time, and finished reading "Youth Self-Cultivation" in three days, which has improved his political culture. For example, Comrade Li Yuchang of the Linshan Theater Troupe always thought that rain was caused by gods. This time, after reading science knowledge and listening to the instructor's explanation, he understood the reason for the rain, not because of gods.

    Because the "Culture Shed" has achieved remarkable results in the work of bringing culture to the countryside, and at the same time has expanded the scope of work and activities of rural theater troupes, making them more suitable for the current needs of the liberated rural areas, the Taiyue Federation of Literary and Art Circles specially presented the He and Linshan theater troupes with: "The Pioneer of Combining High-Level Education with Low-Level Education" award flags. In order to further expand the "Culture Shed" movement throughout the region on the basis of the achievements and experiences they have already created.

    实行文化下乡
    屯留的“乡村文化”报和“文化棚”
    孙克明
    屯留自去年开展翻身运动后，文化活动也随着有飞跃的发展特别是群众歌谣、快板、戏剧的创作和活动。但就整个文化活动的范围来说，大半仍只局限于学校，还不能说已经深入到农村中的每个角落，深入到群众中去；经验也没有很好地交流，群众的创作运动也没有进一步普遍地开展，已经创作出的作品，也因为没有发表的地盘，而得不到推广。为此，在今年年初特创刊“乡村文化”小报和创设“文化棚”。实行以来，半年中获得很大成绩，特在此介绍。
    “乡村文化”报
    为了使文化下乡，为广大群众所有，和交流经验使群众的文化生活得以提高，必须使群众有自己的文化园地。但对此都没有经验，怎样搞法呢？为了集思广益和试验，在年前召集了城关的文教界座谈，大家说可以利用文化书店的石印试办一不定期的小报刊，由小到大随办随看，成功了再说，名字就叫“乡村文化”。这个意见都同意，当时恰巧正当要搞年关娱乐，所以第一期的内容，就以小调、歌谣、快板、对联、小型秧歌剧为主，以推动年关娱乐。经费暂由文教科和文化书店垫出来以后再说：半月后，在年关出刊了。出刊后，首先给各区村、机关学校赠送一份，征求意见。结果反映很好，当下就有很多人写搞来，并表示自己一定帮助使它坚持下去。于是就把这些搞件（多半是文娱创作），专门出了一本五十多篇的年关娱乐小册子，分送到各村去，立即得到更大更普遍的欢迎。年关后接着是参军，“乡村文化”这时就专门反映参军工作，对参军又起了很大的推动作用。于是又获得政府领导方面的拥护，政治部说：“乡村文化”是屯留不可缺少的东西，无论如何不能中途停刊了。
    现在接着办下去是不成问题的了。因此正式成立“乡村文化”报社，社长郝金堂，并由小学教员申枝选、冀岗专门负责编排，确定为定期的七日刊，经费由政治部、政府、银行捐赠出一笔生产基金、和文化书店一起搞。
    半年来，共出了三十二期，每期都根据全县当前的工作定出中心和小社论，还有解放区与国际国内的大事，对于工作很起了推动领导的作用。它的基本特点，就是走群众路线，真正做到大家办大家看。现有通讯员五百余人，分散在全县各个角落，随时反映各处的群众活动。在语言和形式上，纯粹是土言土语，看得懂听得懂；形式上多半是短小精悍的短文和歌谣快板，长的就转“岳北人民报”或其他报刊。所以通讯员说：“不用也不怕。”交了“乡村文化”就等于交给了大报社。在编排和内容上，既包罗万象，应有尽有，又活泼醒目。有“光荣台”“文摊”“文艺”“市话”“信筒”“小广播”“资料室”“小医院”“国际国内新闻”……等，使每个人都可找到他需要喜好的东西。目前这个小报不仅流行于全县，而且在太岳区各县和各机关里都订的有，并且附近各县还有村干部直接给“乡村文化”寄稿。
    半年来除获得以上成绩和经验外，他们还编了很多书。如“跟上共产党走”“三英雄”“怎样反特”，“屯留翻身经验集”等，在文化活动上，有了“文化扑克”“看图识字”小册子，还印刷了年画、漫画。半年中共印书一千本以上。
    文化棚
    为了使文化活动的各部门互相配合，使高台教化与低台教化相结合，在县剧团——河、麟山两个剧团中，各设“文化棚”，也就是流动图书馆。里面有各种农村应用书刊，有鼓书、快板、讲故事等宣教活动。每到一处演出，有专人负责，在未开戏前，利用观众没事进行宣传、卖书、讲书、让群众阅读。这种做法很有成绩。如卖书，麟山剧团在吾元出演时，三天就卖了一万多元的书，比城里文化书店七天卖的还多。两个月内共卖了九万多元。特别是在演出前做宣传活动，说快板，唱鼓词，最受群众欢迎。如河剧团在鲍店说书，听的有一千多人。麟山剧团在吾元说大鼓，听的人比看戏的人还多。
    另外在剧团内部，也解决了大家看书报的要求，扩大了文化生活的园地，加强了文化教育。如河剧团的小红同志，一有空就看书，三天看完了“青年修养”，在政治文化上都得到提高。如麟山剧团的李育昌同志，一向以为下雨是有神，这次看了科学常识，又听了指导员的讲解，才懂开下雨的道理，不是有神。
    因为“文化棚”在文化下乡工作中得到了显著的成绩，同时扩大了农村剧团的工作和活动的范围，使其更加适合目前解放区农村的需要，太岳文联特赠河和麟山剧团：“高台教化配合低台教化的先声”奖旗各一面。以进一步在他们已创造出的成绩和经验之上，在全区普遍展开“文化棚”运动。
