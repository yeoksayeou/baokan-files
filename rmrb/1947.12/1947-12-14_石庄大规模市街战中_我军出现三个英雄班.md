Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, December 12th: In the large-scale street fighting during the liberation of Shijiazhuang, three heroic platoons emerged from our army, displaying both wisdom and courage. The Liang Zhenchi Platoon of the "Wei Village" unit, on the evening of the 11th, after our army broke through the enemy's inner city moat, this platoon advanced fiercely towards the enemy's core fortifications. Liang Zhenchi scouted along the street and discovered an enemy scout approaching. Liang immediately hid in the corner of the wall, blocked him with his gun, and then explained our policy on prisoners of war, telling him: "You are surrounded. If you don't surrender, you will only be annihilated." Liang learned from the scout that there was an enemy battalion there, so he asked the scout to call out the enemy platoon leader, guaranteeing their safety. After the entire enemy platoon surrendered their weapons, Liang then persuaded the platoon leader to negotiate with the battalion headquarters. Liang shouted: "Communicator, tell the 1st company to go to the left, the 2nd company to the right, and the 3rd company to follow me." The enemy immediately surrendered all their weapons. We suffered no casualties. Another heroic platoon was the Zhang Chenfeng Platoon. The entire platoon used prisoners of war to shout, wedging themselves in the middle of the enemy's defensive line, approaching the enemy battalion headquarters and firing shots. Zhang cleverly ordered the troops to deploy, shouting: "Communicator, tell the regiment headquarters to shell the target in front." The enemy panicked and immediately stopped fighting, sending representatives to beg for surrender. Some in the enemy doubted the surrender. Zhang ordered the soldiers to fire machine guns and grenades fiercely. The enemy finally surrendered the entire battalion, with only four soldiers in the platoon injured. The Yao Zhenxi Platoon of the "Han Village" unit, after breaking through the enemy's front line on the morning of the 12th, discovered that they had lost contact with the main force. In the spirit of attacking wherever there was gunfire, they rushed into the enemy's core fortifications, but the rear was blocked by the enemy and they were under fire from both sides. Yao saw a machine gun muzzle sticking out of an enemy bunker and rushed forward, grabbing the machine gun to pull it out. He couldn't pull it out for a long time. The enemy slammed the bunker door shut and fired wildly. He hid using the blind spot. Then he discovered another small pillbox and commanded the platoon to advance and occupy it. He used the original fortifications to shout to the enemy, but the enemy still refused to surrender. Yao then said: "If the enemy doesn't surrender, communicator, tell the rear to open fire." Just then, our artillery selected this location as a target and began shelling. The enemy immediately sent representatives to surrender, and more than 200 enemy guns were captured.

    石庄大规模市街战中
    我军出现三个英雄班
    【新华社晋察冀十二日电】解放石庄大规模市街战中，我军出现智勇双全的三个英雄班。“魏村”部梁振池班，十一日晚我军突破敌内市沟后，该班向敌核心工事猛进时，梁振池沿街侦察，发现一敌人侦察员迎面而来，梁即躲在墙角下，拿枪堵住他，然后向他解释我俘虏政策，并告诉他：“你们已被包围，如不投降，只有被消灭。”梁从该侦察员口中得悉该处有敌人一营，乃叫该侦察员召出敌排长，保证他们生命安全，敌全排缴械后，梁又说服该排长去营部谈判，梁则高叫：“通讯员，叫一连向左，二连向右，三连跟我来。”敌人随即全部缴枪。我无一伤亡。另一英雄班为张忱凤班，全班利用俘虏喊话，插在敌防线中间，逼近敌营部打枪，张机智下令布置部队，高叫：“通讯员，告诉团部向前面目标打炮。”敌惊慌失措，即停止战斗，派出代表乞降，敌中有少数分子对缴枪怀疑，张即令战士猛打机枪和手榴弹，敌终于全营缴械，而该班仅四人受伤。“韩村”部姚振喜班于十二日清晨突破敌前沿后，发现和主力失了连络，本着那里有枪声就向那里进攻的精神，冲入敌核心工事，但后路被敌封锁，又为敌火力夹击，姚见前面敌地堡枪眼露出一挺机枪，一个猛冲，拉住机枪往外就拔，半天拔不出来，敌扣响机门，枪打得火热，他利用死角隐蔽起来；接着他又发现另一小炮楼，即指挥该班前进占领，便利用原工事向敌喊话，敌仍不投降，姚就说：“敌人不缴枪，通讯员告诉后面开炮，”恰好我炮兵选定此处为目标打起炮来，敌即派代表来投诚，共俘敌人枪二百余。
