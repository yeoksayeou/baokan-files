　　Careless Negligence Leads to Losses!
  　The Enemy in Anyang Seizes Over Two Thousand Jin of Grain
    [Our Newspaper, Zhangnan News] On November 17th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's 117th Regiment, the puppet "Cixian County Security Regiment," and the "Township Office," totaling three platoons, forcibly seized over 500 "civilian laborers," carrying three machine guns. They departed from Dougong and went to Honghe, Liuzhuang, and other villages over 20 li north of the city to seize grain. When departing, they organized one soldier with five "civilian laborers." Upon entering the villages, they looted from house to house. However, when the enemy entered each house, the masses, both men and women, old and young, struggled with the enemy to prevent them from seizing grain. Some grabbed the enemy's clothes to prevent them from looting, while others held onto the "civilian laborers'" bags. In the midst of the struggle, one of our units was already firing shots outside the village. Hearing our gunfire, the enemy fled in panic. The "civilian laborers" begged the masses for mercy, saying, "I'll pour out the grain for you, just give me the bag." The masses, hearing the gunfire getting louder and closer, held onto the bags even tighter and angrily replied, "Wait and go, or just drop the bags and run!" Consequently, the "civilian laborers" abandoned the bags, and the army, disregarding the civilian laborers, scattered and fled. We wounded four enemy soldiers, killed one, and seized three rifles, over 250 rounds of ammunition, and two mules. The enemy only managed to seize 2,100 jin of our grain.

　　麻痹疏忽就要吃亏！
  　安阳敌抢走粮食两千多斤
    【本报漳南讯】十一月十七日困守安阳的蒋匪军一一七团、伪“磁县保安团”、“乡公所”共三个排的兵力，强抓“民夫”五百余，带机枪三挺，由豆公出发到城北二十余里的洪河、刘庄等村抢粮，出发时编制一个兵带五个“民夫”，一进村即到各户乱抢，但敌人进到各家时，群众都是男女老少和敌人争夺，阻止敌人抢粮，有的拉住敌人的衣服不让抢，有的抓住“民夫”的布袋不放。正在争夺之际，我某部已在村外打枪，敌人听到我们的枪声，慌乱逃跑，“民夫”向群众求饶说：“俺给你倒出粮食给俺布袋。”群众听枪声愈响愈近，更抓紧布袋不放。并气愤的答：“等等走吧，不然把布袋丢下跑吧！”因此“民夫”丢掉了布袋，军队也不顾民夫，四处逃散，我当击伤敌四名，打死一名，缴获步枪三枝，子弹二百五十余发，骡子两头，敌人仅抢去我粮食二千一百斤。（石峰、吴兴、孙文活）
