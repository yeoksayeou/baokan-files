　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 29th: The majority of Yan bandit's 73rd and 42nd divisions, and a portion of the 45th division, totaling about two divisions of troops, led by Gao Zhuozhi, the commander of the bandit's 34th Army, invaded the northern border of Qinyuan on the 13th to loot grain. On the 14th and 15th, the bandits were repeatedly intercepted in the Wanghe and Guanziling areas and did not dare to advance. On the 16th, the bandits divided into groups, attempting to sneak into Wangfeng, Yanjialing, and Guzhai, but were met with a head-on attack by our local armed forces. After fierce fighting until 3:00 PM, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and fled in disarray, with over 200 bandits killed or captured, including those below the rank of battalion commander.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 26th: Delayed news: A certain unit of the Jinnan Liberation Army captured and defended the southeastern corner of the city during the siege of Yuncheng from the 9th to the 11th of last month, repelling eleven counterattacks by Chiang bandits, remaining steadfast and winning commendation from General Wang Xinting of the Taiyue Military Region. The firepower of步枪 at this position could block the throat of the Chiang bandits' Huoshen Temple, and artillery could fire directly at most of the fortifications within the city. On the 9th of last month, the brave soldiers of this unit bravely seized this position, and the Chiang bandits immediately launched a fierce counterattack, with fierce fighting continuing for three days. At 1:00 PM on the 11th, the Chiang bandits launched their final all-out desperate struggle, with the bandits coming on extremely fiercely, firing 30 to 50 rounds per minute, attempting to completely destroy this position of only a hundred meters or so. In front of a bunker, 29 shells landed consecutively, and the telephone line to the command post was repeatedly cut by shrapnel. The brave soldiers prepared grenades, remained calm, and awaited the fierce battle. Whenever Chiang bandit infantry charged up, they were met with a sudden and painful blow. The smoke blackened the faces of the brave soldiers. Our three brave soldiers, Wei Xiaowu, Wei Baikuan, and Yao Yongsheng, threw grenades until their arms were swollen. The 9th company at the front of our position persisted in the bunker amidst the intense crossfire of five enemy machine guns. Two holes were shot through the outer cylinder of the heavy machine gun, and the brave soldiers tore off pieces of cloth to plug them and continue firing. Finally, after suffering over 200 casualties and consuming nearly 10,000 artillery shells, the Chiang bandits finally retreated into Yuncheng in a panic.

    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十九日电】阎匪七三、四二两师大部，四五师一部，共约两个师的兵力，在匪三十四军军长高卓之率领下，于十三日由平（遥）介（休）犯我沁源北境抢粮。十四、十五两日，该匪在王和、关子岭一带经我节节阻击，未敢前进。十六日该匪分股图再向王风、阎家岭、古寨窜进，遭我地方武装迎头痛击，激战至下午三时，敌不支狼狈回窜，共毙俘匪营长以下二百余。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十六日电】迟到消息：晋南解放军某部于上月九日至十一日运城围城中夺取与坚守城东南角阵地，击退蒋匪十一次反扑，屹然不动，荣获太岳军区王新亭将军嘉奖。该处阵地步枪火力即可封锁蒋匪咽喉火神庙，大炮可平射城内大部工事建筑。上月九日，该部勇士英勇夺得此一阵地，蒋匪立即凶猛反扑，激战持续三日。十一日下午一时，蒋匪最后一次集中全力作决死争夺，匪来势极猛，每分钟发炮三十发至五十发，欲将此仅百余公尺的阵地完全毁灭，我一地堡门前即连续落弹二十九发，通指挥所的电话线时为弹片击断。勇士们则准备好手榴弹，不动声色，迎候恶战。每当蒋匪步兵冲上来时，即予突然痛击，硝烟把勇士们的脸熏得焦黑。我卫小五、卫白宽、姚永胜三勇士，投掷手榴弹把胳膊都摔肿了。我阵地前沿的第九连，在敌人五挺机枪的狂炽交叉火网中坚持着地堡。重机枪外筒被打穿了两个洞，勇士们就撕下衣布塞住再打。最后，蒋匪于死伤二百余消耗炮弹近万发后，终于狼狈缩入运城。
