　　The Yan bandit, struggling in his death throes, is employing all sorts of cruel methods against the people of Pingyao. In the county magistrate meeting he convened, he openly decided to kill another 600 farmers in Pingyao in order to complete his plan of collecting two shi three dou eight sheng of wheat (or three shi one dou of mixed grains) for every two liang of silver. In addition to using guillotines to forcibly collect grain from the people, he has recently implemented so-called "Rebirth Associations" in various villages. Whenever the Yan bandits arrive in a village, they force the masses to gather and recount their life histories, from the age of seven to the present, forcing them to cry and slap their own faces while speaking, until their faces are red and swollen. Any omissions or forgetfulness are met with beatings to death or detention. Those who cannot pay the grain are subjected to the confiscation of their property and expulsion from their homes. Currently, in the Houbei and Ducun areas, there are many masses who have been driven out. On September 10th, the Yan bandit Hao Jianrong led the "Struggle Corps" in a bloody massacre in Guozegou, killing twelve farmers in one instance, severely injuring seven, taking away eleven livestock, and destroying eleven civilian houses. This bloody, bestial behavior of the Yan bandits has not only failed to subdue the people of Pingyao, but has also aroused the masses to wage a heroic struggle against the Yan bandits. For example, after the Yan bandits' bloody massacre in Guozegou, the masses in the village captured five Yan bandits, including Ma Lan, Hao Jianbing, and Du Xianjun, and held a public memorial revenge meeting with over three hundred people, sacrificing Ma Lan and others alive at the spirits of the dead.

　　阎匪垂死挣扎残害平遥人民
    【本报太岳二十八日电】作垂死挣扎的阎匪，正以各种残忍手段加在平遥人民身上。在其召集的县长会议上，公开决定，不惜再杀害平遥六百农民，来完成其每两粮银征麦子二石三斗八升（杂粮三石一斗）的计划。除以铡刀强征民粮外，近又在各村实行所谓“转生会”。阎匪每到一村，即强迫群众集合自述其生平历史，从七岁到现在的所作所为，并逼着要边说边哭边打自己的脸，打得红肿才行，如稍有遗漏或忘记，就要用乱棍打死或扣押。如不能缴纳粮食，即查封家产，赶出门外。现我侯北、杜村一带，即有许多被赶出来的群众。九月十日阎匪郝建荣率“奋斗团”血洗果则沟，一次即杀死农民十二人，重伤七人，拉走牲口十一头，捣毁民房十一处。阎匪这种血腥兽行，不仅没有压服平遥人民，更激起群众对阎匪作英勇斗争。如阎匪血洗果则沟后，该村群众即活捉阎匪马兰、郝建炳、杜显俊等五人，召开三百多人的公祭复仇大会，把马兰等人活祭于死难者的灵前。
