　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 3rd: A true record of the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Jiaodong: (1) Mad Massacre. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits led their "Homecoming Corps" and "Despot Teams," clamoring for "landlords to turn over," and carried out a mass slaughter of peasants. 1,500 people were killed in Gaomi, 2,000 were killed in Jiaogao (new county) in three days, and more than 6,000 people suffered in the southwest of Laiyang and the south of Changi. In Zhanggezhuang alone, thirty bodies were stuffed into a well. In the Xiagezhuang area, more than 1,200 people were killed. In Cuijiabu Village, with more than 40 households, 35 people were murdered. In Linquan Village, 75 households were exterminated. In Xiaozhudong Village, except for two despot households, all the remaining 27 households were killed. Li Guangqian of Zhaogezhuang had his entire family killed, except for himself. Xing Gui'e, a young woman from Dagao Village, and five others were raped, tied to the street, had their nipples cut off and stuffed into their eyes, and then had red-hot gun barrels inserted into their vaginas, stirring them to death. The peasant Xing Rentian was stripped naked, his whole body was doused with boiling water, and then the blisters caused by the scalding were swept open with a broom, called "sweeping the Eighth Route Army's hair," and he was swept to death. Cao Wenli, a peasant from Caoguantun, and another peasant were hung on opposite ends of a beam. Because Cao's body was heavy and could not maintain balance, his hands, feet, and muscles were cut off piece by piece until balance was achieved, and then he was beaten to death. In addition, some were tied behind livestock and dragged to death, some had the skin all over their bodies cut off, called "cutting hedgehogs," some were cut into pieces with knives and then burned, and thrown into the river to drown. Hao Guangzhang's family of five in Gaolan Village, his father was seventy years old, and he had three sons and a wife. First, the second son was forced to beat the third son to death, then the eldest son was forced to beat the second son to death, and finally the whole family was murdered. (2) Unparalleled Rape. According to statistics from the six districts of Tingkou in Pingdu South County, more than 1,240 women were raped after Chiang Kai-shek's bandits passed through once. Xu Maosheng's mother, who was eighty-four years old in Dongguan, Zhucheng, was also gang-raped, and the women of Balizhuang were forced to dance naked Yangko and then driven to the city for collective gang rape. Zang Xuemei of Daxuegezhuang, Laidong (new county), who was eight months pregnant, was gang-raped and miscarried, and the fetus was fed to wolves. On a wall in the Guo family store in Yexian County, the shameless "poems" of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were found: "Traveling all over the world to see beautiful women, wearing out iron shoes to find beauties, exhausting a thousand legs a day, never taking off empty at night." (3) Devastation like washing. In hundreds of villages on the outskirts of Zhucheng, no chickens could be heard crowing, and no water jars could be found in the entire village of Guchengzi. More than 1,000 houses around Pingdu City were demolished, and all the trees within two miles of the city were cut down. In Dazhuang Village, Yaqian County, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits robbed 51,467 catties of grain, 740 pieces of clothing and bedding, and 2,345 bolts of cloth. All the farm implements were burned. The masses in Laiyang City angrily spread the following ballad: "Kill all the chickens, can't hear the chickens crowing, don't know tomorrow. Innocent girls are raped, there is no law and no heaven. Young men are arrested, and the old and young at home cry to heaven. The grain is robbed, there is nothing to eat, crying to heaven. The trees are cut down, boundless, can't cover the sky. The roofs are torn off, can't keep out the wind and rain, broken houses are exposed to the sky. Sooner or later, one day, we will wipe out this gang of thieves, and everyone will see the sunny sky again!"
