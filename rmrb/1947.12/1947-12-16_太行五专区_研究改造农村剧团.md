    Taihang Fifth Special District
    Studies and Reorganizes Rural Theatrical Troupes
    [Our Taihang News] In order to cooperate with the upcoming large-scale counter-offensive, strengthen propaganda against the enemy, and promote the rural theater movement in the district, the Fifth Administrative Office of the Taihang Special District convened a meeting of representatives from rural theatrical troupes throughout the special district on November 25th. A total of 102 representatives attended. The main content of the meeting was to clarify the direction, exchange experiences, and resolve existing problems within the troupes. Regarding the direction of the theatrical troupes, it was clarified that rural theatrical troupes should serve the emancipated peasants; the actors should primarily be emancipated peasants; and the performed dramas should mainly be new dramas. Historical dramas should be strictly reviewed and reformed before being allowed to be performed. Old dramas that promote feudal superstition, obscenity, or theft should be strictly prohibited from being performed. In terms of form, preference should be given to folk forms that can express the lives of the masses. In addition, regarding the exchange of experiences, it was clarified how the troupes should integrate with central tasks and how to follow the mass line. During the meeting, in order to facilitate discussions combined with practical situations, the Xinhua Theatrical Troupe of Lin County organized an evening performance, performing the opera "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "Merit Report," and the reformed historical drama "Counterattack Against Xuzhou," among others.

    [Another Dispatch] The Propaganda Department of the Taihang Fifth District Party Committee, in order to implement the study of current events, instructed all counties to launch winter schools. 1. In core counties and core areas of border regions, launch a winter school movement focused on current affairs education, combining production with literacy. District cadres should serve as teachers in the winter schools. The organizational form of the winter schools must be integrated with winter transportation, weaving, and other production organizations; forced orders are not allowed. 2. Border areas should combine political offensives with current affairs education, combining local specific materials with the actual struggles of guarding Ding, guaranteeing grain, and protecting property, explaining that the closer the enemy gets to death, the more frantic they become, that the enemy's frenzy in northern Henan is temporary, exposing the various conspiracies of landlords and special agents, and calling on the masses to rise up and actively struggle.
