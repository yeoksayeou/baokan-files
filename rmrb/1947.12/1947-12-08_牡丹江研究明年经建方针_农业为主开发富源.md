　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd. The Mudanjiang Provincial Government (newly established province merging the Mudanjiang and Dong'an districts) held a provincial financial and economic conference from October 16th to 31st to discuss the specific implementation of the 1948 economic construction plan outline. Based on the principle of agriculture as the main focus, it was decided that the province would reclaim 60,000 hectares of wasteland and increase grain production by 60,000 tons next year. At the meeting, initially, everyone failed to recognize the spirit of the conference, and in various reports, they all focused on difficulties and complained about poverty. Later, after carrying out self-criticism and overcoming ideological obstacles, many counties examined the mistakes and shortcomings in their past financial and economic work. Jining County examined its concealment from superiors, fearing that the superiors would assign tasks. Winter clothing could have been self-sufficient, but they still asked the superiors for supplements. They grabbed from the lower levels (various districts) and did not help solve difficulties. Some individual districts only issued half of the 200,000 catties of soybean cake that the special commissioner's office lent to solve the spring famine, and the other half was used to solve the winter clothing difficulties of the organs. Muling County examined loopholes in public grain, such as over-reporting losses. For example, the special commissioner's office stipulated that one stone of rice was 242 catties, but the county government collected 262 catties of rice, using the excess as production funds. The agricultural production of the organs in Mishan adopted the exploitative landlord and rich peasant management method of forced exchange of labor with the masses. In addition, some counties have also made great achievements in financial and economic work. For example, Dongning organized the production of honored soldiers, workers in various industries, and farmers, which increased the wealth of the people and reduced the government's financial burden. Mudanjiang City organized nearly 10,000 poor people in the city to transfer to rural mines for production. The province has also achieved great results in financial and economic work, mainly providing sufficient food, clothing, and financial expenditure for the Party, government, and army over the past two years. The annual agricultural output per hectare generally exceeds 2,000 catties. In terms of industry, the Jingbo Hydropower Plant and the Jixi Power Plant have been restored, and many coal mines and gold mines have been mined. Organs and troops have generally carried out agricultural production. One regiment alone harvested 3,000 stones of rice. However, because Mudanjiang did not have a clear financial and economic policy in the past, and Dong'an's financial and economic policy was fundamentally wrong, focusing on speculative trade, selling scrap, and engaging in processing industries to cope with expenditures, and even violating policies and harming the interests of the masses, this was entirely due to insufficient understanding of the development of the war situation and the economic characteristics of the Northeast. The conference summary finally pointed out that the Mudanjiang area has superior economic conditions: such as Dongning having fertile fields that can yield eight stones above and eight stones below, the province has power sources that can generate 100,000 kilowatts, and two large lakes rich in fish. Almost every county has other gold mines, coal mines, and forests. As long as we resolutely implement the correct policies and guidelines, and implement the mass line, we will definitely be able to meet the needs of the war and further improve the people's lives.

　　牡丹江研究明年经建方针
  　农业为主开发富源
    【新华社东北二日电】牡丹江省政府（新设省牡丹江、东安两分区合并），十月十六日至三十一日，召开全省财经会议，讨论具体实施一九四八年经济建设计划大纲，根据以农业为主的方针，确定全省明年开荒六万垧，增粮六万吨，会议上最初大家没认清会议精神，在各种汇报中，均着重提出困难，诉苦诉穷，后经过展开自我批评，克服思想障碍，许多县份都检讨出过去财经工作中的错误和缺点。鸡宁县检讨了对上隐瞒，怕上级要任务，冬衣本可自给，仍要上级补充，对下级（各区）抓一把，不帮助解决困难，甚至个别区将专署为解决春荒贷发的二十万斤豆饼，只发出一半，另一半则用来解决机关冬衣困难。穆棱县检讨钻公粮空子，如多报损失，又如稻子一石专署规定二百四十二斤，县府则收米二百六十二斤，把多余的用来作生产资金。密山机关农业生产，采用强迫与群众换工的地主富农经营方式。另外有些县份在财经工作也做出很好成绩，如东宁组织荣誉军人、各业工人农民的生产，增加了人民财富，减轻了政府财政负担。牡丹市组织城市近万贫民，转到农村矿山生产等。在全省财经工作上也有很大成绩，主要是充分的供给了党政军两年来的吃穿和财政开支，全年农业产量每垧地一般收获均可超过二千斤。工业方面恢复了镜泊水电厂，鸡西发电厂，开采煤矿、金矿多处、机关部队普遍进行农业生产，仅某部一个团，即收稻三千石。但由于牡丹江过去没有明确的财经方针，东安财经方针又根本错误偏重于投机贸易、卖破烂、搞加工工业来应付开支，甚至违犯政策，损害群众利益，这完全是由于对战争形势的发展与东北经济特点认识不足所致。大会总结最后指出，牡丹江区有优越的经济条件：如东宁有上打八石、下打八石的沃野，全省有可发十万基罗瓦特的电源，有两个产渔丰富的大湖，其他金矿、煤矿、森林，差不多每县都有，只要坚决执行正确的政策方针，贯澈群众路线，则一定能解决战争的需要，并进一步改善人民生活。
