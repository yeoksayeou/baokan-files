    【This newspaper, Taiyue, 9th dispatch】 Thirty-three businesses in Changcun Town, Tunliu, convened a business meeting on the 1st to launch the winter production campaign. The meeting first discussed the relationship between businessmen and farmers. Everyone believed that agricultural prosperity is business prosperity, and it is necessary to overcome the old businessmen's awareness of being detached from mass production. After unifying their understanding, based on how to support the masses in winter production and how businessmen can serve the farmers, the Businessmen's Association and the Farmers' Association jointly formed an Agricultural-Commercial Mutual Aid Society, raising 700,000 yuan and absorbing floating capital from the masses to purchase cotton in bulk, wholesale it by street, and collect money at low prices. The village has thirty-nine women who weave, requiring a total of 400 catties of cotton, guaranteeing that there will be no difficulty in obtaining cotton. To improve weaving, the two cotton fluffing shops in this street also promised to guarantee fast and good fluffing, without delaying the masses' spinning and weaving. In order to facilitate the accommodation of incoming and outgoing transportation vehicles, the five mule and horse inns on this street reduced the lodging fee to 150 yuan per vehicle and guaranteed clean stables, warm rooms, and suitable conditions for people and animals. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, each business also made regulations, sweeping the streets once a day, and the twenty mills diligently adding bedding to the pens. The merchants are divided into groups to accumulate fertilizer, guaranteeing that the 120 military dependents in the village will not have difficulty in obtaining fertilizer next year.
