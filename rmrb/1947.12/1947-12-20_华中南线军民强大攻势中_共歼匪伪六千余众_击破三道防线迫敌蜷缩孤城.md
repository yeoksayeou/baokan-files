    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 18th: Frontline reporters report on the powerful offensive by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on the central and southern fronts of Huazhong: In the ten days from the 30th of last month to the 9th of this month, the PLA, in coordination with local armed forces, annihilated a total of more than 6,000 Chiang Kai-shek's regular troops and local forces on the southern front, removed more than 50 Chiang Kai-shek strongholds, and destroyed Chiang Kai-shek's "defense system" on the north bank of the Yangtze River and the local reactionary regime, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to huddle in a few isolated cities and a few strongholds. The vast rural areas were liberated and have been connected into one piece.
    
    Chiang Kai-shek's bandits originally had three lines of defense on the north bank of the Yangtze River, from north to south, namely the Tai (county)-Hai(an)-@(Cha) line, the Tai (xing)-Huang (qiao)-Ru (gao)-Jue (gang) line, and the Tai (county)-Tai (xing)-Jing (jiang)-Tong (Nantong)-Hai (men)-Qi (dong) line, and other highways formed a number of "blockade networks." This so-called "defense system" of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits has been shattered by the PLA's ten-day strategic offensive. From the night of the 30th of last month to the 3rd of this month, the PLA first captured strategic locations such as Libao and @cha on the Hai(an)-@(Cha) line, destroying the eastern section of the enemy's first line of defense for more than ninety miles, annihilating more than 3,400 enemies. The army then marched south, and successively recovered Matang, Chahe on the Ru (gao)-Jue (gang) line, and Shigang and Wuzongbu, important places northeast of Nantong, from the 6th to the 8th, annihilating another thousand enemies. At the same time, the local armed forces of our First Sub-district recovered strongholds such as Renjiazhuang, Haojiabao, and Jiali on the Ru (gao)-Huang (qiao) line from the 1st to the 8th. At this point, more than half of the enemy's second line of defense was destroyed by us. Another unit of the First Sub-district's local armed forces, after removing nine strongholds along the river, such as Kunlushi and Zhangjiaqiao in Jing (jiang)-Tai (xing) on the night of the 26th of last month, captured and recovered ten strongholds such as Xinshenggang and Wujia Kiln on the Ru (gao)-Xin (sheng gang) line from the 1st to the 3rd of this month. At this point, the enemy's third line of defense was also broken. The local armed forces of our First and Second Sub-districts, in coordination with the PLA's southern expedition, annihilated a total of more than 1,600 enemies. It is particularly worth pointing out that millions of people on the southern front rose up to cooperate with the PLA to launch a comprehensive overwhelming guerrilla war, extensively destroying highways, bridges, and telephones, paralyzing Chiang Kai-shek's transportation, and besieging enemy strongholds everywhere. On both sides of the Tai (xing)-Huang (qiao) line alone, more than 10,000 people were involved, forcing Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to retreat from ten strongholds such as Gejiaqiao. The powerful offensive of our liberated army and local corps combined with the emancipated peasants has frightened Chiang Kai-shek's bandits into chaos, and they have been transferring the entire 51st Division of the Central China Northern Front, the 90th Brigade of the 4th Division along the Grand Canal, and all the forces that could be pieced together from the Jiangnan troops overnight to rescue the emergency in Central China. However, the military and civilians in Central China will continue their efforts to smash any of Chiang Kai-shek's dying struggles.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th: Hundreds of thousands of emancipated peasants in Dongtai and Ru(gao)dong counties in central Jiangsu Province have shown the following characteristics in supporting the southern offensive: (1) Detailed organization and specific division of labor. There are stretcher, combat, transportation, civilian workers, capture, engineering, guide, boatmen, service, laundry, funeral, gas lamp (for hospital at night) teams, and communication, purchasing, and repair groups. The service team carries necessities for wounded soldiers such as spoons, bowls, chopsticks, and teapots. Stretchers in a village in Juma District of Ru(gao)dong are mostly composed of poor and middle peasants. They were afraid that the wounded would suffer, so they put cotton quilts and pillows on the stretchers, making them soft and comfortable, from the confiscated goods during the liquidation. The newly elected group leader of Shuangyao Village received a task when it was dark, and was worried that it could not be completed, but the peasants guaranteed that they would prepare the stretcher ropes overnight and set off as scheduled. In Yifu and Douzheng townships in Dongcheng District of Dongtai, a thousand-person stretcher team and more than 500 civilian workers were formed in just half a day and one night. (2) A high degree of discipline. The logistics team in Juma District, Rudong, once conducted discipline education, discussed the restoration of the six major policies of the district, and ensured that they would not take a needle or thread from the people's homes when entering the street, and would not let go of an enemy. (3) Pay attention to combining with land reform review. For example, Haichen Township in Rudong set out conditions for merit and demerit, stipulating that support for the front, review, and war preparation should be combined. The logistics team waiting to set off continues to divide the land equally; the logistics team that has been concentrated is engaged in complaining about hardships and sealing feudalism. Therefore, the mood is even higher.

    华中南线军民强大攻势中
    共歼匪伪六千余众
    击破三道防线迫敌蜷缩孤城
    【新华社华东前线十八日电】前线记者报导华中南线解放军大攻势：自上月三十日至本月九日的十天中，解放军配合地方武装，在南线已歼灭蒋匪正规军及地方部队等共六千余众，拔除蒋匪据点五十余处，摧毁了蒋匪长江北岸的“防御体系”及当地的反动政权，迫使蒋匪蜷缩于几座孤城及少数据点内，广大农村获得解放，并已连成一片。
    长江北岸蒋匪原有三道防线，由北而南，即泰（县）海（安）＠（茶）线，泰（兴）黄（桥）如（皋）掘（港）线，及泰（县）泰（兴）靖（江）通（南通）海（门）启（东）线，并与其他公路组成若干“封锁网”。这一个蒋匪的所谓“防御体系”，已被解放军十天战略攻势所粉碎。上月三十日夜至本月三日，解放军首以攻克海（安）＠（茶）线上战略要地李堡、＠茶等四据点，一举摧毁敌第一道防线的东段九十余里，歼敌三千四百余名。大军旋即挥戈南下，于六日至八日先后收复如（皋）掘（港）线上之马塘、岔河及南通东北要地石港、五总埠，又歼敌千余名。与此同时，我一分区地武于一日至八日间，收复如（皋）黄（桥）线之衽家庄、浩家堡、加力等据点。至此，敌第二道防线又被我摧毁过半。一分区地武另部继上月二十六日夜拔除靖（江）泰（兴）沿江昆芦市、张家桥等九据点后，复于本月一日至三日间攻克与收复如（皋）新（生港）线上之新生港、吴家窑等十据点。至此，敌第三道防线亦被打破。我一、二两分区地武配合解放军南征，共歼敌一千六百余名。值得特别指出的，是南线数百万人民奋起配合解放军全面开展排山倒海的游击战，大举破袭公路、桥梁、电话，使蒋匪交通陷于瘫痪，并到处围困敌据点。仅泰（兴）黄（桥）线两侧即卷入群众万余人，迫退葛家桥等蒋匪十据点。我解放大军与地方兵团翻身农民相结合的强大攻势，使蒋匪吓得手忙脚乱，星夜调运华中北线淮海地区之整五十一师，运河沿线之整四师九十旅及江南部队等所有可能拼凑的兵力，以救华中之急。但是华中军民将再接再厉粉碎蒋匪的任何垂死挣扎。
    【新华社华东十七日电】苏中东台、如（皋）东等县数十万翻身农民支援南线攻势中，表现了如下的特色：（一）组织细密，分工具体。计有担架、参战、运输、民工、捕捉、工兵、向导、船工、服务、洗衣、殡葬、汽灯（医院夜间用）等队，及通讯、采办、修理等组。服务队携带有调羹、碗筷、茶壶等伤兵必须用品。如（皋）东掘马区某村担架，大部是贫雇、中农组成。他们怕伤员痛苦，特将清算中得来的棉被、枕头铺上担架，柔软舒适。双窑村新选小组长天黑时接到任务，担心不能完成，但农民群起保证，一夜之间准备好担架绳索，如期出发。东台东城区毅夫、斗争两乡，仅半天一夜时间即组成千人担架队及五百余民工。（二）高度的纪律性。如东掘马区后勤队曾集中进行纪律教育，讨论恢复区六大政策，保证进街不拿民家一针一线，不放走一个敌人。（三）注意与土改复查结合，如如东海辰乡订出功过条件，规定支前、复查、备战三者结合。待令出发之后勤队，仍继续平分土地；已集中之后勤队则进行诉苦查封建。因此情绪更高。
