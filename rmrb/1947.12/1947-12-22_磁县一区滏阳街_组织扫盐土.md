　　Fuyang Street, Cixian First District
  　Organizes Salt Soil Sweeping
    [This newspaper's Cixian dispatch] In Fuyang Street, Cixian First District, the majority of the masses and militia have participated in salt soil sweeping mutual aid teams. Initially, they had many concerns about sweeping salt soil, not daring to say how much money they earned, fearing it would be counted as a burden. Later, with the active support of the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau, the government's attitude was clarified, explaining that the money earned from sweeping salt soil would not be included in the burden. Rice was exchanged for saltpeter, with rice being issued first, followed by the requirement for saltpeter. This conscious support played a significant role. Zhang Min, a 46-year-old man, said, "From spring to now, I have boiled 400 jin of saltpeter and 800 jin of salt. I plan to boil 300 jin of saltpeter and 600 jin of salt from October to the end of the year." Veteran soldier He Delin recalled the hardship of boiling saltpeter in the past and said to everyone, "The government is so good to us now, organizing us to produce. The enemy, the Kuomintang, disrupts our production. One year, when I was boiling saltpeter, they smashed my big pot and wouldn't let me boil it." After discussion, thoughts were cleared, and the number of salt soil sweeping households increased from 32 to 54 (including 22 military dependents and 32 poor farmers). Five mutual aid teams were organized. Plans were made, and the recent summary shows that two-thirds have been completed.

　　磁县一区滏阳街
  　组织扫盐土
    【本报磁县讯】磁县一区滏阳街，大部群众民兵参加了扫盐土互助组。开始他们对扫盐土有好多顾虑，不敢说赚多少钱，怕叫出负担。后经硝磺局的积极扶植，表明了政府的态度，说明扫盐土赚的钱不出负担，并将米兑硝，先发给米，然后要硝，这样有意识的扶植，起了很大作用。四十六岁张民老汉说：“春天到现在我熬硝四百斤，盐八百斤，我计划从十月到年底，熬硝三百斤，盐六百斤。”和德林老军属回忆了以前熬硝苦，向大家说。“现在政府对咱们可好哩，组织咱们生产，敌人国民党，捣乱咱生产，那一年我正在熬硝时，将我大锅砸坏，不让我熬。”经过讨论，打通了思想，扫盐土户由三十二户，增到五十四户（内二十二户军属、三十二户贫农）。组织了五个互助组。订了计划，最近总结已完成三分之二。
