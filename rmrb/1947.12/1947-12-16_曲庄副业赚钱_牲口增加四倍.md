    Quzhuang Makes Money from Sideline Occupations; Livestock Increases Fourfold
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 14th] Farmers in Quzhuang, Tunliu, are seizing the time to organize sideline production, and the village's livestock has increased beyond pre-war levels. Under the leadership of Liu Yuxia, Quzhuang organized small-scale cooperatives, starting with the development of transportation, organizing everyone to exchange paper for pots and bowls. In the beginning, everyone lacked capital, so he first lent out two hundred catties of rope to help everyone. The cooperative does not have a storefront, but simply records work points for shares. Each person is credited with one work point per day, and livestock also counts as one work point. When buying and selling, people and livestock eat and drink at the cooperative's expense, and eat their own food when they return. Last winter, ten people participated, and this spring it developed to twenty-eight people and nine head of livestock. Under Liu Yuxia's influence, this spring two blacksmiths, three carpenters, nineteen unskilled laborers, and seven head of livestock organized a blacksmith and woodworking factory, making mills and cutting spinning wheels. In addition, nine people sell pots and bowls. At the same time, with the support of the cooperative, a weaving factory was established. In February of this year, Liu Yuxia called on everyone to buy livestock. At that time, the cooperative's principal and interest reached more than one million yuan, but some people were afraid that buying livestock would increase their workload, and some felt that carrying things on a shoulder pole was enough and did not want to buy. Lao Liu mobilized everyone, saying, "If everyone buys livestock, the workload will be lighter. Carrying things on a shoulder pole can earn money, but it is ultimately not as profitable as transporting with livestock." Therefore, at the Tunliu city fair in February, the whole village bought more than twenty head of livestock. By March, when the spring plowing competition began, the number of livestock in the village had increased to sixty-three. After the concentrated spring plowing, they seized the gaps to transport goods in large quantities, running north to Yangquan, east to Shexian Henan Dian, and west to Hongdong. When going to Yangquan, Liu Yuxia personally led twelve carts, earning 700,000 yuan in one trip. In August, more than ten head of livestock were added. By October, the total net profit from small-scale cooperatives, factories, and transportation in the village was 5,574,600 yuan, and the number of livestock increased by ninety-one head, four times more than during the Japanese occupation, and exceeding the pre-war level.

    曲庄副业赚钱
    牲口增加四倍
    【本报太岳十四日电】屯留曲庄农民抓紧时间组织副业生产，全村增加牲口超过战前水平。曲庄在刘玉夏的领导下，组织小型合作社，并从发展运输着手，组织大家换纸卖锅碗。开始，大家没有本钱，他自己便先借出二百斤绳头，协助大家。其合作社并不设门面，只是记工入股，每人每天记一工，牲口也是顶一工，来往买卖主要靠担挑，人与牲口外出时吃喝合作社的，回来吃自己的。去年冬季开始有十个人参加，今春发展到廿八人和九头牲口，在刘玉夏的影响下，今春铁匠二人与木匠三人和十九个笨工、七头牲口，组织起一个铁木工厂，做磨坊，割纺车，另外有九个人，卖锅碗。同时在该社的扶植下，又建立了织布厂，今春二月间，刘玉夏号召大家买牲口，当时他的合作社本利即达一百余万元，但有的人怕买了牲口差事重，有的人觉得担挑就可以，不愿意买。老刘动员大家说：“大家买牲口，差务就轻了。自己担挑能赚钱，但究竟不如买下牲口运输更赚钱。”于是，在屯留城二月会上，全村就买到牲口廿余头。到三月间，开展春耕竞赛时，全村牲口就增加到六十三头，突击春耕后，即抓紧空隙大量运输，北跑阳泉、东到涉县河南店、西下洪洞。去阳泉时，刘玉夏亲自带领，十二辆车，一趟就赚了七十万元，八月间又增加牲口十余头。至十月，全村小型合作社与工厂以及运输等项生产，共获纯利五百五十七万四千六百元，牲口增加九十一头，比日寇侵占时期增加四倍，并已超过战前水平。
