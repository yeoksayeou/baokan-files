    A Brand New Propaganda Tool
    ——Introducing the Border Region Literary Association's "New Foreign Films"
    Lú Diàn
    "New Foreign Films," first created in Yan'an in 1944, were enthusiastically welcomed by the masses in northern Shaanxi as soon as they appeared. This time, the Border Region Literary Association's "New Foreign Films" have once again proven in the Taihang Mountains that it is indeed the best way to combine art and the masses.
    "New Foreign Films" are a New Form
    From a formal point of view, "New Foreign Films" are transformed and developed from the old "peep shows"; but in essence, it is not a continuation of the "peep show," but a completely different new art form.
    The "peep show" was originally not produced by the people, and it cannot be regarded as an art. It cannot be compared with Yangko dance, local opera, or drum songs. According to the records in Li Aitang's "Yangzhou Painting Boat Record" from the Qing Dynasty, the "peep show" appeared during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, a very wealthy salt merchant in Yangzhou hired countless "talented scholars, actors, and prostitutes" for his lewd pleasures. Among them, a person from Jiangning invented a toy for him. From the outside, it was a square and round wooden box, but inside it was filled with various "strange and mysterious plays." Because the round holes for viewing inside were fitted with five-color convex lenses from the West, it was named "peep show." Later, this thing spread to the countryside and became familiar to the rural areas, but the content was still to lure and poison the audience with novel, bizarre, and lewd things!
    "New Foreign Films" are completely different from "peep shows": the content reflects the real life and struggles of the masses, the performance is a combination of comic strips, storytelling, and musical accompaniment, not only with pictures, but also with poetry (lyrics); not only with color, but also with sound (singing and music). Where the lyrics are abstract, the pictures give concrete images; where the pictures are insufficient, the singing gives vivid explanations; music strengthens the beauty of the sound and rhythm of the singing, and strengthens the artistic atmosphere of the scenes and characters in the pictures. So it is not only good-looking, but also good-sounding. In the external device, the round holes and convex lenses are removed, because the content is not "strange and mysterious plays" that cannot be seen in "broad daylight," so there is no need to cover up; at the same time, in today's new rural situation, the emancipated masses generally have the demand to enjoy cultural life. If mirrors are installed, only four or five people can watch at a time. Now, not only the mirrors are removed, but also the mirror box is removed, and it is transformed into a stage-style picture frame, so that four or five hundred people can watch at a time. Therefore, it is not only good-looking and good-sounding, but also can be watched and listened to by many people.
    "New Foreign Films" also have a superior condition in performance. It is light and flexible, suitable for cultural propaganda in scattered rural areas: the restrictions of material conditions and weather and terrain on it are very small, and it can be performed anytime and anywhere. The work of two or three people can receive almost the same effect as a theatrical troupe.
    This "New Foreign Film" should be said to be a comprehensive art form that combines fine arts, poetry, music, and singing, a brand new mass art form.
    The Masses Approved It
    The performance of this "New Foreign Film" began as a trial performance in several nearby villages. On the first day in Shierzhuang, not many people came at first, but after performing ten or so pictures, some people in the audience went back to call those who had not come. Originally, we were worried that the film was too long and that some people might leave halfway, but the audience's emotions were tense from beginning to end. After the performance, they also requested a re-performance. That day, there was originally a fair in Wu'an, and some people said: "This is better than going to the fair, it is good-looking, saves money, and does not require running errands." Some people said: "This is better than watching a big show, it is all about our own affairs." That night, the streets and alleys were full of discussions about the characters in the foreign film. In this way, the reputation of "New Foreign Films" spread to foreign villages at once. From then on, every time we arrived at a place, as soon as we set up the frame and beat the drum, people would be crowded around. After the performance in Tianerzhuang, the masses would not let us leave no matter what, and insisted on performing again at night. We said we were going to another village, and they said: "If you go to our village, we won't spare you. We guarantee to send you with livestock early tomorrow morning." When we went to Yangyi to catch up with the fair, we were worried that no drama could attract the audience, but we always performed after the drama was over. Not only did the audience not disperse, but even the vendors around the stage, hearing the audience constantly cheering, could not help but stand and watch. The director of the troupe also listened and recorded the lyrics while listening. After the performance, cadres from several villages went to the general command headquarters to negotiate, requesting us to perform in their villages. When performing in Zhaozhuang, after the people's writer Zhao Shuli watched it, the first thing he said was: "This is truly serving the masses. This form is good and can be developed."
    There is a reason why "New Foreign Films" are so popular with the masses. Fu Shan, deputy director of the Hexi Farmers' Association, said it well: "Foreign films are good, easy to understand, easy to hear, and all are actual things." This shows that the "New Foreign Film" form is loved by them; at the same time, it also shows that the content is also liked by them, because what we performed was "Land to the Tiller."
    The entire plot of the story is structured with fifty-five pictures. From one picture to another, the audience sees the activities of various characters, sees the brutality and despicable image of the landlord class, sees the suffering of the poor when they are oppressed and sacrificed, and how they carry out spontaneous resistance in the dark and heavy encirclement, and the clearer and more determined struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party, so as to eliminate the feudal landlords and become the masters of the new society. No, they also saw themselves from the pictures, because their past and present are the same as the poor people in the pictures. They are sad for the sadness of the characters in the pictures, and happy for the joy of the characters in the pictures, or in other words, they are sad and happy for the sadness and joy of their own class. When they saw the landlord Wang Santai strip the scalp off the braid of an old tenant, Wang Jizu, in order to seize his house and land, and rape his daughter-in-law, Lianzi, forcing her to hang herself; and falsely accuse his son, Wang Dong, of being a thief, forcing him to wander away from home, to the point of begging for food, wasn't it natural to shed tears? When they saw the Eighth Route Army liberate that place, saw Wang Dong return to the village to mobilize the masses, saw the struggle, and the shooting of Wang Santai, they showed joy and excitement, and when they saw the distribution of fruits, they responded with warm cheers and applause, wasn't that also natural?
    After the performance in Hexi, it immediately gained the class resonance of the kind-hearted peasants. Militia Ling Shan, women's federation member Dizi, and sixty-year-old Shuzi Niang (middle peasant) said in unison: "Hei Tingdie, a dirt-poor person in our village, also had his braid stripped off by the landlord Lao Wanzi. In the movement (land reform), Lao Wanzi ran away. If he is caught in the future, he should be dealt with by the public like Wang Santai." A woman named Ji Jiuzhi in Shierzhuang watched the foreign film, wiped away her tears and went home, unable to eat dinner. She said: "When I saw Wang Dong, I remembered my past poverty. My man herded sheep for a lifetime, and the landlords would whip him whenever they wanted! Wasn't I the same as Lianzi in the old society? Where it was hot, where it was cold, whoever was not afraid when walking in front of the wealthy..." Speaking of this, she simply burst into tears! She just kept saying: "I won't say it! I won't say it!" Later, she said again: "Seeing the end, the suffering was also avenged, and the masses were also lifted up. That's it, and I'm happy again!" Examples like this, where the audience and the characters in the story are united, are countless.
    After watching the foreign film, the village cadres also thought of their own work. Liu Zhengfu, director of the Shierzhuang Farmers' Association, said when he saw Wang Santai organizing secret agents, posting anonymous letters, and shooting from the shadows: "The landlord's methods are many, and our struggle must be resolute." A cadre in Tianerzhuang said when he saw Wang Santai using all means to buy off Yang Mantang, director of the Farmers' Association: "This is an education for us. We must never take the upper-level landlord line." While in Qingyansi, the audience thought of the chairman of the Farmers' Association who had been dismissed in their own village. On the spot, someone stabbed his back with his finger and said, "Isn't this Yang Mantang!" And he himself turned red!
    There is no doubt that this performance has played a role in enlightening and educating the masses; but in turn, they have educated us even more. They are the personal experienceers of various struggles of "Land to the Tiller," and are the main creators of destroying the old society and building the new society. Their position is clearer, their class line is clearer, and they have put forward many insightful and practical opinions and requirements to us. They said:
    "Shooting Wang Santai with a gun cannot relieve the hatred of the masses"!
    Their reason for this is that Wang Santai is a bully, a traitor, and a secret agent, who harmed so many people's lives. Even quartering him would be too good for him.
    For places where the power of the masses is not fully expressed, they pointed out:
    "Wang Dong is shown too much, and the poor people beside him are shown too little."
    Regarding the insufficient expression of the fruit distribution process, they pointed out:
    "If the fruits are not carefully discussed by the masses, it may be difficult to distribute them fairly!"
    "The cadre part mentions this and that too much, and the masses mention it too little" (referring to the lyrics).
    What women are most dissatisfied with and most concerned about is:
    "Why didn't Lianzi come up to take revenge when Wang Santai was being struggled against"?
    "Why aren't the landlord's women being dealt with? The bad things they do are no less than men"!
    "Why haven't the landlord's maids been emancipated"?
    The masses in Zhaozhuang also proposed:
    "Why isn't Chairman Mao seen in the picture? Without him, we still can't be emancipated." This not only shows that they have a clear understanding of the relationship between the Party and the masses, but also shows their belief and love for the people's leader!
    As for the paintings themselves, this time they have also undergone a test among the masses. There are two general reflections: first, "the paintings are realistic"; second, "the paintings are alive." But what they like most is the few pictures that move them the most in content, or in other words, the few pictures where the plot develops to a climax, and they especially like the picture of distributing fruits. (It's as if when we read a novel, we follow the descriptive parts, but when we get to the climax, we have to read it repeatedly several times.) This shows that all forms, all performance techniques, are mainly determined by the content, and determined by whether what is expressed is the truth of life. The masses do not ask what expression method you use, but only ask whether what you express is something they have seen, or experienced firsthand, or yearn for; they only ask whether what you express is something that entertains them, educates them, and inspires their lives and struggles; or in other words, the masses only ask whether you paint truthfully, similarly, and vividly. For example, the picture of Wang Santai's daughter-in-law seducing Yang Mantang, the masses felt that it was not drawn enough like a "broken shoe". They said: "It is not drawn enough evilly"; but when they saw Lianzi and Wang Dong plowing the land after emancipation, they felt that it was not beautified enough. They said: "Lianzi is not drawn beautifully, she is drawn old"! This not only shows the practical spirit of the masses, but also shows how clear and strong their class emotions, right and wrong, love and hate are!
    In the past, some people said that the masses can only accept the expression method of "single-line flat coating." This is completely a fixed view of things. To put it seriously, it is a view that looks down on peasants. What they mean is that peasants will always only be worthy of watching some flat things. This time, the paintings are all using the light and shade expression method. Who says that peasants have no sense of three-dimensionality? Ren Xingpei, a peasant in Shierzhuang who doesn't know a single word, said: "The paintings are really good. One by one, they are standing there. They are not on the paper. The paintings are separated from the wall." How many intellectuals who think they have a "sense of three-dimensionality" can say or have such a vivid and concrete "sense"? Do the masses have their own appreciation habits? Yes, that is, they require the picture to be clear, the image to be complete, and the colors to be strong and bright. This is one factor why the picture of distributing fruits is so popular.
    This "New Foreign Film" is only approved by the masses because it is "easy to understand (drawn realistically and vividly), easy to hear (mass language, local accent), and all are actual things (Land to the Tiller)".
    How to Improve and Promote
    In addition, the People's Daily, Xinhua Bookstore, People's Art Troupe, Xingzhi School, and other cultural and educational workers have also given us many valuable opinions. The details of the content related to "Land to the Tiller" have been transferred to the comrades of the Art Workshop as a reference for their future revisions. Here, I will only summarize a few opinions on the improvement and promotion of "New Foreign Films" below:
    1. The content of "New Foreign Films" should reflect reality in a timely manner. The content of "Land to the Tiller" has too many clues and involves too many issues; in the future, "New Foreign Films" should advocate one line and solve one problem.
    2. The film should not be too long, no more than twenty pictures at most, but there should be many sets. A lonely set cannot meet the needs of the masses. In order to make it easier to promote, the device should be simpler and more preferably in the form of a newspaper clip.
    3. The performance can take the form of a cultural shed, distributing a large amount of cultural food to the countryside: such as Chairman Mao's portrait, picture albums, comic strips, New Year pictures, songbooks, books, newspapers, and magazines.
    4. The Art Workshop should establish close links with folk painters and, if necessary, establish short-term art training classes for mutual learning. Then let them return to various places to popularize "New Foreign Films" and other new art to every corner of the countryside.
    5. It should be suggested or directly assist the civil education halls of various counties to organize folk painters and storytellers to form "New Foreign Film" propaganda teams.
    6. Literary or poetry workers should cooperate with art workers to write "New Foreign Film" lyrics (preferably in cooperation with folk storytellers). If we want to be able to directly recite what we write to the masses, is there a better way than through paintings and through the mouths of storytellers?
    7. The good films of the Art Workshop should be reprinted and promoted to various places (together with the songbook), with at least one set for each county's civil education hall and each brigade's political department.
    "New Foreign Film" is a brand new and powerful propaganda tool, which has been affirmed. But it is only just starting, it has not yet taken root in the vast rural areas, and it has not yet formed a wide and enthusiastic movement. This requires art workers and cultural institutions in various places to pay attention to it, study it, develop it, and promote it. This is our wish and the requirement of the masses.

### 一个崭新的宣传工具——介绍边区文联“新洋片”

    一个崭新的宣传工具
    ——介绍边区文联“新洋片”
    芦甸
    “新洋片”，四四年创始于延安，它一出现就获得陕北群众热烈的欢迎；这一次边区文联的“新洋片”，又在太行群众中再一次证明它确是美术与群众结合最好的道路。
    “新洋片”是新形式
    “新洋片”从形式上看，是从旧的“西洋镜”改造和发展起来的；但从实质上看，它不是“西洋镜”的继续，而是一种和旧的“西洋镜”完全不同的崭新的艺术形式。
    “西洋镜”原来就不是产自民间，它也算不得是一种艺术，它和秧歌，地方戏，大鼓等是不能相提并论的。从清人李艾塘著的“杨州画舫录”的记载里看，知道“西洋镜”出现于清乾隆四五十年间，那时扬州有一个最富豪的盐商，雇有无数“奇人才士俳优娼女”供其淫乐，其中有一个江宁人给他发明了一种玩具，从外表看，是一个方圆的木匣，里面却装有各种“怪神秘戏”，因为向里观看的圆孔上，装有来自西洋的五色凸透镜，所以取名叫“西洋镜”。后来这个东西流传到了农村，为农村所熟悉，而内容仍然是以新奇、怪异、淫荡的东西来引诱观众，毒害观众！
    “新洋片”和“西洋镜”完全不同：内容是反映群众的现实生活和斗争，表演是以连环画结合说唱与音乐伴奏，不但有画，而且有诗（唱词）；不但有色，而且有声（歌唱与音乐），唱词抽象的地方，画面给以具体的形象；画面不足的地方，演唱给以生动的说明；音乐又给演唱加强声音与节奏的美感，给画面上的场景和人物加强艺术的气氛。所以不但好看，而且好听。在外部装置上，取消了圆孔和凸透镜，因为内容不是不能在“光天化日”之下见人的“怪神秘戏”，就用不着遮演；同时，在今天新的农村情况下，翻身群众普遍都有享受文化生活的要求，如果装镜子，一次就只能看四、五个人，现在不但取消了镜子，而且取消了镜箱，改造成一种舞台式的画框，一次就能看四、五百人，所以，不但好看好听，而且还能很多人看，很多人听。
    “新洋片”在演出上还有一个最优越的条件，它轻便灵活，适于在分散的农村进行文化宣传：物质条件和天候地形对它的限制性很小，随时随地都可以演出。两三个人工作，就能收到几乎与剧团相等的效果。
    这种“新洋片”，应该说是溶美术、诗歌、音乐、演唱于一炉的综合性的艺术形式，崭新的群众性的艺术形式。
    群众批准了它
    这次“新洋片”的演出，开始只是在附近几个村里试演。头一天在史二庄，起初来的人并不多，但演到十来张，观众中就有人回去把没有来的人叫来。原先我们担心片子太长，恐怕中途有人离去，但观众自始至终，情绪一直都是紧张的。演完以后，还要求重演。那天本来武安有会，有的说：“这比赶会强，又好看，又省钱，又不跑腿”。有的说：“这比瞧一台大戏还强哩，演的都是咱自己的事”。当晚街头巷尾到处都可以听到对洋片里的人物的议论。这样，“新洋片”的名声一下就传到了外村，从此，我们每到一处，架子一搭，鼓一点，人就围得满满的。在田二庄演完以后，群众无论如何不让我们走，一定要求夜里再演。我们说要去别村，他们说：“你到咱村，饶不过你们了。咱明天一早保证用牲口送你们”。去阳邑赶会，我们又担心没有戏能吸引观众，但我们每次都是在戏完以后出演，台下观众不但不散，连四围摆摊的小贩，听到观众不断叫好，也忍不住站着瞧起来了。剧团导演还边听边记录唱词。演完以后，好几个村的干部，都到大会指挥部交涉，要求我们去他们村里出演。在赵庄演出时，人民作家赵树理同志看完以后第一句话说：“这才是真正为群众服务，这样的形式好，可以发展”。
    “新洋片”所以能受到群众欢迎，不是没有理由的，河西副农会主任福善说得好：“洋片好，看得懂，听得清，都是实际事”。这就说明了“新洋片”这一形式为他们所爱好；同时，也说明了内容也为他们所喜欢。因为我们演的是“土地还家”。
    故事的全部情节是以五十五张画面结构而成的，观众从一张一张的画面里，看见各种人物的活动，看见地主阶级的残暴和卑污的形象，看见穷人们被压迫时和被牺牲时的受难的情景，和他们在黑暗重重的包围下，如何悲愤地进行自发性的反抗，以及在共产党领导下所进行的更明确更坚决的斗争，以致消灭了封建地主，做了新社会的主人。不，他们从画面上还看到他们自己，因为他们的过去和今天，和画面上的穷人们是相同的。他们为画面上的人物悲而悲，喜而喜，也是为自己的悲而悲，喜而喜，或者说，是为他们自己阶级的悲喜而悲喜。当他们看到地主王三泰为了霸占一个老佃户王继祖的房地，把他的辫子吊脱了头皮，并且强奸他儿媳妇莲子，逼得她上吊寻死；又诬赖他儿子王栋做贼，逼得他流落他乡，以致于要饭等场面时而流泪，那不是很自然的吗？当他们看到八路军解放了那块地方，看到王栋回到村上发动了群众，看到斗争，枪毙王三泰时而现出愉快和兴奋，看到分果实而报以热烈的欢呼与掌声，那也不是很自然的吗？
    在河西演出后，立刻得到善良农民的阶级共鸣。民兵灵山、妇会员地子及六十多岁的书子娘（中农）异口同声地说：“俺村赤贫黑亭爹也是给地主老万子吊脱了辫子的。运动里（土改）老万子跑了，将来捉住也应该象王三泰那样由众人处理。”史二庄一个叫计久只的妇女，看了洋片，擦着眼泪回家，夜饭也吃不下。她说：“俺看了王栋，就想起自己过去的贫寒，俺男人放了一辈子的羊，地主们要过来鞭子就打！咱在旧社会还不是跟莲子一样样，那热上那，那凉上那，走到老财跟前，谁不害怕………”说到这里，她简直痛哭失声了！只是连连说：“咱不说了！咱不说了！”后来她又说：“瞧到后头，苦情也报了，群众也抬起来了，就这，我又高兴了”！象这样观众和故事里的人物结为一起的例子，是举不胜举的。
    村干部看罢洋片，也想起自己的工作来了。史二庄的农会主任刘正富看到王三泰组织特务，贴无名信，打黑枪时说：“地主的办法就是多，咱斗争就是要坚决。”田二庄一个干部看到王三泰用尽一切办法收买农会主任杨满堂时说：“这对咱有教育，咱坚决不能走上层地主路线。”而在青烟寺时，观众却想起他们自己村上被罢免了的农会主任来，当场就有人用手指刺他的背说：“这不是杨满堂！”而他本人，变得面红耳赤了！
    这次演出，在群众中起了启发与教育作用是无疑的了；但反过来，他们更教育了我们。他们是“土地还家”的各种各样斗争的亲身经历者，是摧垮旧社会建设新社会的主要创造者，他们的立场更明确，阶级路线更清楚，他们曾向我们提出许多精辟而且实际的意见和要求，他们说：
    “王三泰使枪崩，还解不了群众的恨”！
    对这，他们的理由是王三泰是恶霸汉奸，是特务，苦害了那些人命，就是剐死，也便宜了他。
    对于没有充分表现出群众力量的地方，他们指出：
    “显王栋显的多，其傍的穷人显的少”。
    对于分果实的过程表现不够的地方他们指出：
    “果实没经群众详细评议，怕难分的公吧！”
    “提干部分这分那的多，群众提的少”（指唱词）。
    妇女们最不满足和最关心的是：
    “斗争王三泰，为啥没见莲子上去报仇”？
    “地主家娘儿们为啥不见处理？她们办的坏事不比男人少”！
    “地主家丫环为啥没见翻身”？
    赵庄还有群众提出：
    “画上为啥没见毛主席？没他，咱还是翻不了身”。这不但说明了他们对于党和群众的关系有清楚的认识。同时，也说明了他们对于人民领袖的信仰与爱戴！
    对于画的本身，这一次在群众中也经了一次考验，普遍的反映有两个：第一，“画的实际”；第二，“画活了”。但最喜欢的也就是在内容上使他们最感动的那几张，或者说，情节发展到高潮的那几张，更特别喜欢分果实那一张。（好象我们看小说，叙述过程的地方都是顺着看下去，一到发展到高潮的地方，就要反复多看几次一样。）这就说明了一切形式，一切表现手法，主要还是决定于内容，决定于所表现的是不是生活的真实。群众不问你用的什么表现法，只问你所表现的是不是他所见过的，或亲身经历过的，或向往中的事情；只问你所表现的是不是使他们得到娱乐，同时又得到教育，又能鼓舞他们的生活和斗争情绪的东西；或者说，群众只问你画得真不真，象不象，活不活。例如王三泰的儿媳妇勾引杨满堂那一张，群众就觉得还画得不够象“破鞋”，他们说：“画得不够邪气”；但看到翻身后的莲子和王栋耩地那张又觉得不够美化，他们说：“莲子画得不美，画老了”！这不但说明了群众的实际精神，同时，也说明了他们的阶级情感，是非爱憎，是如何分明而强烈！
    过去有人说，群众只能接受“单线平涂”的表现法，这完全是一种对事物固定不变的看法，说得严重一点，是一种瞧不起农民的看法，他们的意思就是农民永远只配看一些平板的东西。这次的画都是用光线明暗表现法的，谁说农民没有立体感呢？史二庄一个字都不识的农民任兴培说：“画得真好，一个一个都在那里立着，不在纸上，画离了墙了。”有几个自以为有“立体感”的智识分子，能说出或能有这样生动而具体的“感”呢？群众是不是有他们自己的欣赏习惯呢？有的，那就是要求画面明朗，形象完整，色彩强烈而鲜艳，这就是分果实那一张所以特别受到欢迎的一个因素。
    这次“新洋片”就是以“看得懂（画得实际，画活了。）听得清（群众语言，本地口音）都是实际事（土地还家）”，才获得群众的批准。
    如何改进和推广
    此外，人民日报、新华书店、人民文工团、行知学校及其他文化教育工作者，也给我们提了许多珍贵的意见，有关“土地还家”内容细节部分，都已转交美术工场同志们，作为他们将来修改时的参考。这里，只把有关“新洋片”的改进和推广的意见，综合几点，写在下面：
    一、“新洋片”的内容，应及时反映现实。“土地还家”的内容头绪太多，牵涉的问题太广；以后，“新洋片”应当提倡一支一线，解决一个问题。
    二、片子不宜过长，最多不超过二十张，但套数要多，孤零零一套，不能满足群众的要求。为了更容易推广，装置上应更简单化，最好能订成报夹形式。
    三、演出可采类似文化棚的形式，把大量文化食粮散布到农村去：如毛主席像、画报、连环图画、年画、唱本、书报杂志等。
    四、美术工场应和民间画家取得密切连系，必要时，成立短期美术训练班，互相学习。然后让他们回到各地，把“新洋片”及其他新美术普及到农村每个角落去。
    五、应建议或直接帮助各县民教馆组织民间画家和说唱家，成立“新洋片”宣传队。
    六、文学或诗歌工作者，应配合美术工作者编写“新洋片”唱词（最好是和民间说唱家合作）。我们要想把我们写的东西，能够直接朗诵给群众听，还有比通过画、通过说唱家的口，更好的办法吗？
    七、美术工场的好片子，应当翻印推广到各地去（连同唱本），最少每县民教馆和每旅政治部能有一套。
    “新洋片”是一个崭新的有力量的宣传工具，这是已经肯定了的。但它还只是刚刚举步，还没有在广大农村中扎根，还没有形成广泛而热烈的运动，这就须得各地美术工作者和文化机关都来注意它，研究它，发展并推广它，这是我们的愿望，也是群众的要求。
