    Jing Shu Di Village
    Poor and Hired Women as Backbone
    Spinning Eighteen Jin of Thread in Five Days
    [This newspaper's Taiyue Dispatch, 10th] Since spinning and weaving began in Jing Shu Di Village, Ying Chao Administrative Village, Yangcheng, on December 1st, eighteen jin of thread have already been spun in five days. In the beginning, village agricultural committee members Ru Xiuqi, Ru Jinyuan, and others bought 120 jin of cotton and individually mobilized hired and poor women like Ru Genlian, carefully explaining to everyone that if each person spun an average of two liang of thread per day, they could spin seven and a half jin of thread in two winter months, which could be woven into three and a half bolts of cloth. This could be sold for 34,000 yuan, enough to buy more than seven dou of rice, enough to survive three months of the spring famine. Having thus opened the minds of the hired and poor women, a collective discussion was held by all the women in the village on November 24th. Because there was already a backbone, everyone's opinions quickly became unified, and it was proposed to freely combine, paying attention to the matching of skills and strengths. The village's forty-seven spinning women and twelve weaving women were organized into nine groups, and nine group leaders were selected (eight of whom were hired and poor women). These nine groups also proposed a merit competition to ensure that each spinning wheel spins four liang per day. Each weaving woman, in addition to teaching apprentices, would weave four large chi of cloth, and would definitely teach the apprentices to learn within two months, spinning evenly and weaving tightly, with a width of one chi and four cun. From October 26th to December 16th, within fifty days, 127 jin of cotton would be spun and sixty-two and a half bolts of cloth would be woven. The difficulties of the thirty hired and poor spinning women would be addressed by the village's mutual aid society, which would first issue thirty jin of cotton for spinning and weaving. After all arrangements were made, it began on December 1st, and eighteen jin of thread have already been spun in five days.

    贫雇妇女作骨干
    五天纺线十八斤
    【本报太岳十日电】阳城应朝行政村荆树底，从十二月一日开始纺织，五天内已纺出十八斤线。开始该村农会委员茹修启、茹金元等，就一面买棉花一百二十斤，一面去找雇贫妇女茹根莲等，进行个别动员，给大家仔细打算，如每人每天平均纺二两线，冬两月可纺七斤半线，织成三匹半布，能卖洋三万四千元，能买七斗多米，能渡三个月的春荒。这样先打通了雇贫妇女的思想，于十一月二十四日，召开全庄妇女集体讨论。因为已有了骨干，大家的意见很快就一致起来，提出自由结合，注意巧拙优劣的搭配，把全庄四十七个纺妇、十二个织妇组成九个小组，选出九个小组长（有八个是雇贫妇女），这九个组并提出立功竞赛，保证每把车每天纺四两。每个织妇除教徒弟外，织布四大尺，两个月内一定教会学会，纺的匀、织的紧，面宽一尺四寸。从十月廿六日开始，到十二月十六日止，五十天内纺完一百二十七斤花、织成六十二匹半布。三十个雇贫纺妇的困难，由该村互助社先发给三十斤花纺织。一切布置妥当后，于十二月一日开始，五天内已纺出十八斤线。
