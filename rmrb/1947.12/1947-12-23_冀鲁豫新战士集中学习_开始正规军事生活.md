Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region New Soldiers Concentrate on Study
　　Beginning Regular Military Life
　　[This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch on the 20th] New soldiers from various parts of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, after being concentrated for enlistment, have begun to study military life. New soldiers in Nanle County are first gathered by district and then transferred to the county for assembly. New recruit reception centers in various districts have already begun regularized military life. In the Fifth District, 1,500 young and strong men, comprising seven companies, conduct morning drills at dawn every day. After breakfast, they attend classes or meetings. In the afternoon, they engage in collective games. The new soldiers are in high spirits in the intense training and collective life, and they have successively established merit plans and compete with each other. The Second Company has put forward the following challenge conditions to the First Company: 1. Do not violate mass discipline; 2. Do not ask for leave; 3. Do not desert; 4. Maintain clean living quarters; 5. Line up quickly. The First Company, in response, guarantees to do a good job in mass work, to improve the relationship between the army and the people, and has accepted the Second Company's challenge. The Third Platoon of the First Company has launched a person-to-person competition and has begun to establish door bulletin boards to practice recording and learning well. After more than forty young and strong men in Xiguan, Tongcheng, Dong'a County, signed up to join the army, they automatically formed classes, elected class leaders, and studied army life. In the study, they improve their class consciousness by recalling the suffering they endured in the past and who caused it. After the new soldiers in Puyang enlisted, they immediately launched a merit campaign. The new soldiers are stepping up their studies and striving to be models. Comrade Liu Cheng, the squad leader of the Ninth Squad of the Seventh Company, led all the soldiers in his squad to grind flour for military families. The Second Squad of the Fifth Company fetched water, hauled manure, and hauled cabbage for their landlords. Wang Pixue, a soldier in the Third Squad of the Sixth Company, after being called upon to perform meritorious service, did not watch operas at night, but repaired axles and made frames for his landlord. The landlord happily said, "You new soldiers also understand the old Eighth Route Army rules!"
