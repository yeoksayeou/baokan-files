    The military and civilians in various parts of Central China, in coordination with the southern offensive, launched extensive sweeping and raiding operations against the Chiang bandits. As of the 10th, they had eliminated over twenty strongholds of the Chiang bandits, completely destroying the Chiang bandits' transportation system in Central Jiangsu. After capturing strongholds such as Kunlushi, the local armed forces of the First Sub-district launched an offensive on the Rugao-Xinsheng Port line on the evening of the 1st. By the 3rd, they had recovered eight strongholds including Guanyintang, Wujiayao, Daxiaoshenjiadian, and Xinsheng Port, and forcibly attacked the Zhanghuanggang and Shizhuang strongholds, completely annihilating three companies of the Rugao County Security, capturing over 200 bandits including a company commander, killing or wounding over 20, and seizing nine machine guns and 148 rifles and pistols. The Rugao-Xinsheng Port highway, with a total length of 70 li, is now under our control except for the isolated stronghold of Shizhuang. At the same time, the military and civilians of Taixing County launched a political offensive, forcing the retreat of Gejiaqiao on the Rugao-Hai'an line, Qianjiazhuang and Haojiabao on the Rugao-Huangqiao line, Jiangduo on the Jiangyan-Huangqiao line, and five internal strongholds including Huijiaduo, which had been surrounded for 93 days, eliminating over 100 bandits and puppet troops. The Chiang bandit's 51st and 44th Divisions, stationed in northern Central China, attempted to provide southern reinforcements. The military and civilians in the area immediately launched guerrilla warfare to block the enemy. On the 30th, they annihilated an entire company of the Chiang bandit's 44th Division in the Junhuangji area of Lianshui. At the same time, local militia and the masses conducted a comprehensive and thorough destruction of the 700-li transportation lines, both vertical and horizontal, on which the Chiang bandits relied to maintain military transport. All bridges and telephone lines on the Dongtai-Hai'an, Hai'an-Taizhou, Rugao-Hai'an, Rugao-Huangqiao, Rugao-Xinsheng Port, Nantong-Rugao, Rugao-Juegang, Chengtai-Xinghuangqiao, Jiangyan-Huangqiao, Jingjiang-Taixing, and Gaoyou-Huaian highways have been completely destroyed. The Chiang bandits are trapped in isolated strongholds, living in constant fear. The enemy in the important towns of Fu'an, Anfeng, and Liangduo on the Dongtai-Hai'an line had no choice but to flee in panic.
