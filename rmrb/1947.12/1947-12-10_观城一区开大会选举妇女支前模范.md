　　【This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 8th dispatch】Guancheng First District held a women's congress to summarize work and elect front support models. The criteria are: (1) Active work and firm stance; (2) Good treatment of the families of soldiers and martyrs; (3) Good work in the fields after the men support the front; (4) Making military shoes and socks carefully, well, and sturdily; (5) Automatically taking care of the wounded and the troops stationed in the village, etc. Village elections were held on the 15th and 16th, sub-district elections on the 17th, and district elections on the 18th. At the congress, the elected models from each village compared their merits to determine their ranking. For example, Hao Yuzhi from Sihe Village, whose husband returned home injured from the front, was in low spirits. Under her constant encouragement, her husband recovered quickly and returned to the team. Also, after the young and strong men went out to support the war effort, there was too little labor in the village, so she organized young women to work in the fields. Although she is a military dependent, she does all the work in her fields herself and does not want preferential treatment from the village. When making shoes and socks, the original regulation was four jin of millet for each pair's labor cost, but she made three pairs and refused the millet. Under her influence, all the women in the village voluntarily refused the labor millet. When her village built houses for the dependents of revolutionary martyrs, she organized women to cook. Hearing that troops were to be stationed in her village, she cleaned the houses in advance and actively sent mats and quilts to the stationed troops, and sewed and washed clothes for the soldiers. After discussing and comparing merits, the district selected 21 models of first, second, and third class, and awarded them prizes such as towels and soap. In this district, many models have emerged every time military shoes and socks are made. They made 5,200 pairs of military socks for the factory in two batches, and all villages completed their tasks ahead of schedule and voluntarily refused wages in millet. During the autumn storage period, the district made two batches of voluntary shoes, a total of 5,916 pairs, each pair calculated at 20 jin of millet, saving a total of 118,520 jin of millet. The women's enthusiasm for supporting the front is extremely high.

　　观城一区开大会选举妇女支前模范
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】观城一区召开妇女大会，总结工作，选举支前模范，条件是：（一）工作积极，立场站稳；（二）优抗优的好；（三）男人支前后，地里活做的好；（四）做军鞋军袜认真，做的又好又结实；（五）自动照顾伤员及村内驻军等。十五、十六两日进行村选，十七日小区选，十八日大区选。在大会上各村被选模范比功，再确定等级。如四合村郝玉枝，他丈夫在前方受伤回家，情绪低落，在她百般鼓励之下，使其丈夫伤愈很快的归了队；又在青壮年出战勤后，村中劳力太少，她又组织青年妇女去干场里和地里的活。她虽是军属，但她地里活全由自己亲自动手，不要村中优待；做鞋袜时，原规定每双手工费四斤小米，她做了三双不要米，在她这种影响下，全村妇女都自动不要手工米。她村给抗属盖房子时，她组织妇女做饭；听说本村要驻军队，她预先打扫房子，并主动给驻军送席送被子，给战士缝洗衣服。经过论功比功后，全区选出甲、乙、丙三等模范共二十一人，各发给手巾、肥皂等奖品。该区在每次做军鞋军袜时，都出现了不少模范，两次给工厂做军袜五千二百双，各村都提前完成了任务，自动不要工资米。秋屯时，全区做两次义务鞋，共五千九百一十六双，每双按二十斤小米计，节省小米合十一万八千五百二十斤。妇女支前热情极高。
