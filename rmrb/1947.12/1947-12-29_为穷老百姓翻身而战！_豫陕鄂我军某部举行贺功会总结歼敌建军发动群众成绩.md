Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, December 26th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army completed its annual enemy elimination and merit-making plan in ten months, annihilating 8,512 enemy soldiers and seizing 4,131 rifles, both exceeding the plan by more than twofold. From the 4th to the 6th of this month, the unit held its first grand merit celebration since crossing the river southward, summarizing its achievements in eliminating the enemy, building the army, and mobilizing the masses over the past three months. 306 heroes attended the conference, including various branches of the military and various types of cadres. Cadres accounted for 29% of the heroes, and collectively commended units included one battalion, six companies, seven platoons, and six squads. Commendations for units and individuals between companies and battalions were even more widespread. The slogan "Everyone Makes Merit, Collective Merit-Making" has become a reality. This merit celebration showed three characteristics: First, Communist Party members took the lead in making merit, and the Party's prestige was unprecedentedly enhanced. Party members accounted for 65% of all heroes, fully demonstrating the vanguard role of Party members. At the commendation meeting of the brigade headquarters, the general branch secretary announced on the spot the approval of the requests of three heroes – feeder Xu Fangqing, soldier Jing Wanlong, and He Tang – to join the Party. All comrades stood up and applauded to pay their respects, and the brigade leader personally presented flowers to congratulate them. "It is glorious to be a people's hero, and it is even more glorious to join the Communist Party" has become a common public opinion in the army. Many cadres and soldiers have expressed in their merit-making plans that they will raise their class consciousness, strive to make merit, and strive to become a Communist Party member. Second, this merit celebration showed that a large number of soldiers who were passive and war-weary in the Chiang Kai-shek army, once liberated and joined the People's Liberation Army, quickly demonstrated their unprecedented wisdom, courage, and initiative, and made contributions to the people. In Li's regiment, four former Ye County "Security Corps" liberated soldiers, who had been liberated for less than twenty days, made meritorious service in two battles. Liberated soldier Li Chunfang, who served as an ammunition handler in a certain squad, vividly described on stage how he used earth clods as weapons to capture three prisoners and four rifles in the Shangdian battle. After the story, he excitedly said: "Now I am fighting for the liberation of the poor people of Henan." Third, in the merit celebration, various units generally launched a large-scale challenge to eliminate the enemy and make merit. In Fang's regiment merit celebration alone, three companies, ten platoons, and twenty-one squads were involved in the challenge at one time, launching a comprehensive competition between units and individuals, and all formulated new plans for eliminating the enemy and making merit. On the 7th, the unit held a grand review, and General Qin Jiwei personally reviewed the troops and delivered instructions. All the soldiers solemnly passed the new plan for eliminating the enemy, building the army, and mobilizing the masses in the winter, and guaranteed that they would complete it 100%.

　　为穷老百姓翻身而战！
  　豫陕鄂我军某部举行贺功会总结歼敌建军发动群众成绩
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十六日电】人民解放军某部十个月内完成全年杀敌立功计划，歼敌八千五百一十二名，缴获步枪四千一百三十一支，均超过计划两倍多。该部于本月四日至六日举行南渡以来首次盛大贺功会，总结三个月来歼敌、建军与发动群众的成绩。参加大会的功臣达三百零六名，包括各兵种及各类干部。功臣中干部的比例为百分之二十九，集体立功的单位有一个营、六个连、七个排、六个班。而在连、营之间记功的单位与个人则更为普遍。人人立功、集体立功的口号已经成为事实了。这次贺功会中显示出三个特点：第一、共产党员带头立功，党的威信空前提高，党员占全体功臣的百分之六十五，充分表现了党员的先锋作用。旅直贺功会上，总支书记当场宣布批准饲养员徐芳清、战士荆万龙、和堂等三位功臣入党的请求，全体同志均起立鼓掌致敬，旅首长亲为敬花致贺。“人民功臣光荣，参加共产党更光荣”，已成为部队中普遍的舆论。许多干部、战士都在自己的立功计划中表示要提高阶级觉悟，努力立功，争取当一个共产党员。第二、此次贺功大会中显示出大批在蒋军中消极厌战的士兵，一旦被解放和参加人民解放军后，即很快发挥了他前所未有的智慧、勇敢与积极性，而为人民立了功。李团中解放不到二十天的前叶县“保安团”解放战士，在两次作战中有四人立了功。在某班充当弹药手的解放战士李春芳，登台生动的叙述了他在上店战斗中用土块当武器，捉获三个俘虏、四条步枪的故事之后，兴奋的说：“现在我是为河南穷老百姓翻身而战。”第三、贺功会中各单位普遍掀起歼敌立功的大挑战。仅方团贺功会上，一次就有三个连、十个排、二十一个班卷入挑战，展开单位、个人之间的全面大比赛，都一齐订出了新的歼敌立功计划。七日该部举行大检阅，秦基伟将军亲临阅兵致训。全体战士郑重通过冬季歼敌、建军与发动群众的新计划，并保证要百分之百的完成。
