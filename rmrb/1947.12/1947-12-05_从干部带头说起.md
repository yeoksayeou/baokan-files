　　Starting with Leading Cadres
The scale and quality of this conscription movement are unprecedented, fully demonstrating the determination and will of the liberated peasants to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and achieve a nationwide great liberation, ensuring the purity of the People's Army. However, this mass conscious action is often regarded as the achievement of "leading cadres." For example, in the conscription in Dingzhai Village, Puyang, Tian Liuhe, the deputy squad leader of the militia, slept during meetings and was unwilling to join the army. His wife, as the head of the women's association, was dragging her feet. After criticism from the militia, youth, and women, who said, "You are a cadre and you don't understand!" Tian Liuhe had to express his willingness to join the army. In the end, all thirty-nine young people in the village who were of conscription age signed up. Tian Liuhe was actually considered a leading figure. Similarly, in the summary of conscription experience in Licheng County Committee, there was so-called "cadres and party members taking the lead, and liberated peasants closely following," listing examples, giving the credit of "taking the lead" to cadres for the masses' enthusiastic enrollment in the army.

We must affirm that cadres joining the army is appropriate, and it is also appropriate for them to sign up before the masses. However, if we think that cadres have made contributions in this way, it shows a lack of mass viewpoint, regarding cadres as more "noble" than the masses, which is bureaucratic. In fact, in the past, many cadres were unwilling to join the army themselves, evading conscription, and instead forcing the masses to join the army, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. For example, the masses in Da'ao Village, Erqu, Weixian, said: "In the past, conscription was handled by the village cadres, catching the big shots and engaging in favoritism." The masses in Licheng criticized the cadres, saying: "You know how to distribute the good fruits, but you want to take it easy when it comes to joining the army and contributing your strength. You cadres only talk nicely but don't do practical things. If you don't go, we won't go either!" Even the cadres in Yuanzhuang Village lowered their heads and remained silent in front of the masses. After a half-day meeting, no one spoke, and the women couldn't stand it anymore and stood up and said: "You bring us children to hold, we'll go. You are shameless. When it comes to liberation (referring to the distribution of fruits), you can talk better than anyone!" When the masses rose up, fourteen cadres signed up on the spot. These situations clearly show that the cadres were being pushed forward by the masses, and the cadres were lagging behind the masses. The enthusiasm of the masses, the voice of the masses, is so precious and worthy of our attention! Unfortunately, these have not received enough attention from some leading comrades.

In the conscription work in Jinnan this time, there was a so-called "fair and reasonable" method. According to this method, the labor force of each household is calculated according to points, and whoever should go, goes. This violates the principle of voluntarism and is a wrong method similar to apportionment and drafting. According to the material from Daning Village, Weixian, although the masses spent several days calculating the labor force of the whole village, it was ultimately the branch that mobilized the party members and cadres to join the army. The self-defense captain and other five people stood up at the mass meeting, and a group of young people immediately surged forward. This shows that this kind of method similar to apportionment is not the real demand of the masses. What the masses demand is that cadres and party members also go, but the cadres and party members originally did not want to go. In addition, there are still phenomena of detaining, sealing doors, and forcing people to volunteer to join the army in various places, threatening the masses to join the army. These bad styles must be thoroughly eliminated. Those who commit this error, no matter how well the task is completed, should be severely criticized.

### 从干部带头说起

　　从干部带头说起
    此次参军运动，规模之大质量之高，是空前的，充分表现了翻身农民打倒蒋介石、全国大翻身的决心与意志，保证了人民军队的纯洁。但这种群众性的自觉行动，却往往被认为是“干部带头”的成绩，如濮阳丁砦村此次参军中，民兵副班长田六合，一开会就睡觉，不愿参军，他老婆当妇会长，拉后腿。经民兵、青年、妇女批评他说：“自己是干部还不通哩！”田六合只好表明态度去参军，最后全村够参军年龄的三十九个青年报了名。而田六合竟被认为是带头人物。又如黎城县委会总结参军经验中，亦有所谓“干部、党员起带头，翻身农民紧跟上，”列举事例，把群众踊跃报名参军，给干部记上了“带头”的功劳。
    我们必须肯定，干部参军是应当的，而且先于群众报名亦是应该的，如果以为这样干部就有了功，那就是缺乏群众观点，把干部看成比群众“高贵”的官僚主义。事实上，以往有许多干部，自己不愿参军，逃避参军，反而强迫群众参军，引起群众极大不满。如威县二区大＠村群众说：“过去扩军是村干包办的，捉大头，徇私情”。而黎城群众则指责干部说：“你们分果实知道分好的，参军出力讨轻头，你当干部光说漂亮话，不做实际事，你不去俺也不去！”甚至像元庄村干部在群众面前低头不语，开会半天没一人发言，而妇女们看不下眼站起来说：“你们给我们抱着孩子来，我们去，你们不要脸，翻身（意指分果实）时比谁都会说！”群众起来了，干部当场有十四人报名。这类情形，显然是群众把干部推着走，是干部落后于群众的。群众的热情，群众的呼声，是多么值得我们珍贵与注意啊！可惜这些并未引起某些领导同志的足够重视。
    冀南此次参军工作中，有所谓“公平合理”的办法。按这办法，把各家劳力按分计算，该谁去谁就去，这是违反自愿原则，类似摊派抽丁的错误办法。根据威县大宁村材料，群众虽用几天时间计算了全村劳力，但终究是支部动员了党员干部参军，自卫队长等五人在群众大会上挺身而出，一群青年即蜂涌而起，足见这种类似摊派的办法，并不是群众的真正要求。群众要求的是干部党员也去，而干部党员原来并不想去。此外，各地尚有扣押、封门、强迫自动等威胁群众参军的现象，这些恶劣作风，必须彻底肃清。犯此错误的，不论任务完成得怎样，都应受到严格的批评。
