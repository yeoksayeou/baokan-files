    Facilitating Trade Between the Taiyue and Lüliang Regions
    Representatives from Both Regions Negotiate Currency and Tax Issues
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 15th] To facilitate the smooth import and export of goods produced by the masses during the winter season and to develop trade between the Taiyue First and Second Districts and the Lüliang Ninth District, representatives from both sides convened an economic conference on November 21st. They thoroughly discussed issues related to currency, taxation, and material exchange between the two regions and reached the following agreements:
    (1) Regarding currency issues, the principle of mutual non-circulation and mutual support of currencies between the two sides should be implemented to maintain the currency system's integrity in each region. A common policy of expelling and eliminating KMT currency should be adopted.
        1. To facilitate material exchange between the two regions, it was determined that Hongtong City, Daojue Town, and Zhongshangjiluo Village would serve as currency exchange points for both sides.
        2. The initial exchange rate was set at 18 yuan of Jichaobi (currency of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank) to 1 yuan of Western Farmer's Currency (currency of the Northwest Farmer Bank). This rate would be regularly reviewed and adjusted based on changes in commodity prices and currency conditions, with meetings scheduled monthly. Ad hoc meetings would be convened for any unusual changes.
        3. Regarding exchange procedures, military personnel, government employees, and the general public holding less than 100,000 Western Farmer's Currency would not require any formalities. Those exchanging more than 100,000 would need an introduction from their respective banks. However, each exchange should not exceed 10,000,000 (Western Farmer's Currency).
        4. Individuals carrying non-local currency through the area without using it would be allowed free passage. If the amount is substantial, they must carry documentation to prevent speculation and financial disruption by unscrupulous merchants. If currency usage is discovered, it will not be confiscated or exchanged at a lower rate. However, the user will be educated, and if the situation is serious, appropriate punishments will be given based on the specific circumstances.
        5. Individuals bringing gold and silver into the other region must have a carrying permit from their bank and exchange it for local currency at the other bank. It is forbidden to trade or circulate in the market. If buying and selling is discovered, it will be confiscated.
        6. A consistent policy of expelling and eliminating KMT currency will be adopted by both sides. Anyone bringing it into either region will have it confiscated. In special cases, a special currency permit may be issued.
    (2) Regarding material exchange and taxation:
        A. In principle, goods produced within the two regions should be allowed free passage without being taxed, except for a few specific items, which are specifically regulated as follows:
            1. To reduce consumption in Lüliang and to take care of the Taiyue region, cigarettes, dry tobacco, towels, and soap produced in Taiyue are temporarily not allowed to be transported into Lüliang. Besides educating Taiyue businessmen not to carry them there, if they are seized in Lüliang, they should not be confiscated, the reason should be explained and the goods should be returned to their place of origin.
            2. Cotton and homespun cloth produced in Taiyue can be used to adjust for some of Lüliang's needs. In addition to Lüliang proactively organizing livestock and coal for exchange with Taiyue, two 20,000 jin of cotton and three 30,000 jin of homespun cloth per month are allowed to go to Lüliang for exchange. Certificates must be issued to prevent smuggling.
            3. Livestock from Lüliang to the Taiyue region and homespun cloth from Taiyue to Lüliang are allowed to trade freely and shall not be taxed or prohibited.
            4. Coal and porcelain from Lüliang can be sold in Taiyue in exchange for grain. However, to prevent smuggling that aids the enemy, proof from the administrative village and economic system must be provided, otherwise the grain will not be allowed to leave the territory.
        B. Regarding foreign goods and transit issues:
            1. Any foreign goods that are prohibited from being imported by one party but allowed by the other party must not be imported into the prohibited party; otherwise, the prohibited party may confiscate them.
            2. If both parties allow the import of foreign goods, but the tax rates are different, when the region with the lower tax rate imports into the region with the higher tax rate, taxes must be supplemented according to the difference between the tax rates originally set by both parties before being allowed to enter the region.
            3. Liquor and superstitious articles do not circulate mutually.
            4. When Lüliang exchanges for items prohibited from entering Taiyue and must pass through the First and Second Districts, the local industry and tax bureau (所) must inspect the supporting documents and stamp them upon entry. At the exit point, the goods should be inspected and released according to the entry documents. If there is an increase or decrease in quantity or exchange, the industry and tax bureau may send the incoming goods to the government for processing. If you have a certificate for transporting calico through the area, you are allowed to pass freely.
