　　Italian Working Class Continues to Fight Bravely
　　300,000 Grain Workers on General Strike
　　Tramutola Workers Use Stones to Repel Military Police Suppression

　　[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Dispatch] Rome News: The momentum of the Italian strike movement is still going strong. The Rome strike has just ended victoriously, and the large-scale strikes in Pescara and Sicily have already begun. In the city of Pescara, the city hall has been guarded by 3,000 former guerrillas since the 12th. Because reactionary Interior Minister Scelba cited Fascist laws allowing the reactionary government to dissolve popularly elected local autonomous governments, ordering the replacement of the mayor (a socialist), and, on the pretext that there was no Christian Democratic representative in the municipal council, ordering the dissolution of the council, the local guerrillas defended this democratic organ, allowing the municipal work to proceed as usual. A petition signed by 30,000 people in Pescara has been submitted to the President, demanding the abolition of Scelba's order. The Pescara trade union, in order to support the people's just demands and protest against the reactionary government's fascist behavior, called for a general strike on the 17th. The trade unions of the two largest cities in Sicily, Palermo (the provincial capital) and Catania, announced a general strike starting at midnight on the 16th, demanding unemployment relief. By the 20th, 300,000 grain workers across Italy announced a general strike. The large-scale strike in Sicily province gradually spread from the provincial capital Palermo to Tramutola, Cilla, Messina, and other places. The strikers in Tramutola bravely used stones to fight back against the military police suppression, resulting in casualties on both sides. The strikers also attacked the local headquarters of the Fascist Popular Party. Unemployed workers in Naples also fought against the police because the "Unemployment Bureau" was lying about giving workers "Christmas gifts," enraging the unemployed workers.

    【综合新华社陕北电】罗马消息：意大利罢工运动劲头还正大着。罗马罢工刚胜利结束，贝斯加拉和西西里大罢工又已开始。贝斯加拉城的市政厅，自十二日以来就由三千名从前的游击队员守卫着。由于反动内长谢尔巴引用了允许反动政府解散人民选出的地方自治政府的法西斯法律，命令撤换市长（是个社会党人），并借口市政会议中没有基督教民主党代表，命令解散这会议，地方游击队员就保卫了这个民主机关，使市政工作照常进行。由贝斯加拉市三万人民签名的申请书，已递交总统，要求废止谢尔巴的命令。贝斯加拉工会为了支持人民的正义要求，并抗议反动政府的法西斯行为，已于十七日号召总罢工。西西里两个最大城市巴勒摩（该省省会）及喀大尼亚工会，宣布于十六日午夜起举行总罢工，要求失业救济。到二十日，全意大利三十万粮食工人宣布总罢工。西西里省的大罢工，由省会巴勒摩逐渐波及茶孟塔、奇拉、墨西拿等地。茶孟塔罢工的人们勇敢的用石头反击了军警的镇压，双方都有伤亡。罢工的人并攻击法西斯平民党地方总部。那不勒斯失业工人也对警察斗争起来，因为“失业局”说要给工人“圣诞礼物”只是骗人的，激怒了失业工人。
