The Taiyue Branch of the New China News Agency:

Cuicun, Fushan, overcame the formalistic textile organization in winter production, unified leadership, and decentralized textile production. From November 28 to December 8, in ten days, they spun 230 catties of thread and wove 1,300 feet of cloth. In the village's textile work in February of this year, forced methods were used to form women into groups and concentrate them to weave together. Because some women really couldn't leave their homes, they were unwilling to weave together and preferred to weave at home. For example, Gao Quan'gui wanted to spin at home because her husband was sick, so she could do work and take care of her husband. Chen Shuangyuan, because she was pregnant and about to give birth, requested to spin at her own home, and guaranteed to spin four taels of cotton per day. The cadres didn't allow it, insisting on concentrating the women together. As a result, two looms and two spinning wheels were crammed into one cave, making it difficult to move around. In addition, the women's children were also squeezed into the cave, either crying or shouting, or fighting and cursing. Some women who had no support at home couldn't settle down. It was truly a case of "body at the spinning wheel, heart already at home!" This resulted in low production enthusiasm, late arrivals and early departures, and the spinning wheels and looms were concentrated in one place but remained idle. Because of family matters, women didn't want to come, but if they wanted to spin a little at home in their spare time, there was no wheel. Coming together to weave meant no one was taking care of things at home. Under these circumstances, production efficiency was reduced, and the leadership also put forward "challenges and competitions" and "see who arrives early." This only made things difficult for those women with children and no one to rely on at home. Coming early was impossible, and coming late brought shame, becoming a heavy burden. The leaders also had to call and shout every day, calling on the women to come to "work." If you didn't call them, they wouldn't come. People called the textile group the "calling group," and it disbanded in a few days. When the village arranged winter production in late November, after discussion, it criticized the formalism in the past textile work and the bureaucratic work style of the leadership. It was unanimously agreed that as long as the group had leadership, plans, systems, and inspections, and decentralized work under unified leadership, it was still a textile group. It was not the case that centralized weaving was the only way to call it a textile group. Some young women who had support at home and no children could concentrate on weaving together on a voluntary basis to save lamp oil and compete with each other. Based on this principle, production plans and organizational methods were set, and the organization was re-established. Everyone was in high spirits. In ten days, 179 people spun a total of 233.5 catties of yarn, wove 1,373 feet of cloth, more than 100 catties of warp yarn, more than 50 catties of brushed yarn, wove four money pouches, twelve zhang of mattress cloth, and made 25 pairs of military shoes, 17 pairs of socks, 7 cotton-padded clothes, 7 bundles of Artemisia firewood, and 10 baskets of manure. Among them, Su Yumei and Wang Qinglian were pregnant and about to give birth. They spun cotton at home and completed five days' worth of plans (spinning one catty of cotton) in four days, and also did odd jobs at home.

　　崔村强迫集中纺织结果走了个大弯路
    浮山崔村在冬季生产中，克服形式化的纺织组织，统一领导，分散纺织，自十一月二十八至十二月八日十天中，纺线二百三十斤，织布一千三百尺。该村在今年二月的纺织工作中，用强制的办法把妇女组成小组，集中到一块纺织，因为有些妇女家里实在走不开，不愿到一块纺，愿在自己家里纺织，如高全贵因为自己男人有病，愿在自家纺花，一面做活，一面侍候男人。陈双元因自己怀有小孩，将要临盆，要求在自己家纺，并保证一天纺四两花，干部不允许，非集中在一块纺不行，结果把布机两架、纺车两辆挤在一个窑洞里，圪揽不开，又加上妇女们的小孩也挤在窑里，不是哭就是叫，或者打架骂嘴，一些家内无靠的妇女那能安下心来，真是“身在纺车旁，心早在家里！”弄得生产情绪不高，迟到早退，纺车布机集中在一块闲着。妇女因家事不想来，想在家抽空纺一纺又没有车，到一块纺家里的事又没有人招呼，在这种情况下，生产效率降低了，领导上又提出“挑战竞赛”、“看谁到的早”，这只好苦了那些有小孩的家里又无人可靠的妇女，早了不能来，来迟了又觉得羞惭，成了一个沉重的负担。领导人也每天东叫西唤，叫妇女来“上工”，你不叫她不到。闹的人们把纺织组叫做“叫唤组”，不几天就散了。该村在十一月下旬布置冬季生产时，经过讨论，批判了过去纺织工作中的形式化及领导上的官僚主义作风，并一致认为只要小组有领导、有计划、有制度、有检查，在统一领导下分散做活，也是纺织组，并不是集中纺织才叫纺织组，有些青年妇女家里有靠头，又没有小孩，为了省灯油比高低，在自愿原则下可以集中在一块纺织。根据这一原则，定出生产计划与组织办法，又重新组织起来了。大家情绪很高，十天工夫，一百七十九人共纺织二百三十三斤半，织布一千三百七十三尺，经线一百多斤，刷线五十多斤，织了四个钱褡子、十二丈褥单布，还做了军鞋二十五双、袜子十七双、棉衣七件、拾蒿柴七捆，拾粪十筐，其中苏玉梅、王清莲二人因怀孕临盆。在家纺花，四天完成了五天的计划（纺一斤花），还做了家里的零活。　　　　　　　　　（太岳分社）
