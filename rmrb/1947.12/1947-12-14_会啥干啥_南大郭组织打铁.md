Do What You Know Best
Nan Daguo in Southern Hebei Organizes Blacksmithing

[Report from this newspaper in Xingtai] Nan Daguo Village, in the Third District, has organized all 116 blacksmith workers in the village to engage in winter production (blacksmithing) in order to make up for the poor harvest. At the beginning of the mobilization, the workers had some ideological concerns, such as fear of losing freedom, fear of not making money, and fear of burdens, so they were afraid to go all out. In order to promote this movement throughout the village, village cadres, led by Village Chief Fan Kui and militia cadre Xu Gui Xing, took charge and organized a group of six workers, setting up two blacksmithing furnaces to start working. They specifically implemented an equivalent exchange system, setting piece rates and distributing dividends based on labor. After working for ten days, they calculated the accounts and found that each worker earned a net profit of 1,600 yuan per day, totaling more than 90,000 yuan in profits in ten days. Influenced by such profits, the workers dispelled their ideological concerns, and all the skilled workers in the village voluntarily formed groups and began to work, uniformly implementing the equivalent dividend distribution system. Now, they are all very enthusiastic, and the groups have put forward competitions to see who produces the most pieces and who earns the most profits at the end of the year. Every morning, before dawn, the whole village is filled with the sound of blacksmithing. (Shao Kong, Zi Zhen)

    会啥干啥
    南大郭组织打铁
    【本报邢台讯】三区南大郭村，为补歉收，将全村的一百一十六个铁匠工人组织起来，进行冬季生产（打铁）。在开始动员时，因工人有些思想顾虑，如怕不自由，怕不赚钱，怕负担等，所以都不敢大干，村干为了把这运动在全村推开，首有村长范魁、民兵干部徐贵兴二人负责，组织起来一个组，共六个工人，安了两盘打铁炉干起来，他们具体的实行了等价制，按件订分，按劳力分红。干了十天，算了一下帐，每个劳力每天除了一切开支，净赚红利一千六百元，十天共赚红利九万多元。在他们这样的利润影响下，工人们打破了思想上的顾虑，全村所有的成手工人，都自愿的结合成小组，开始干起来，统一的执行了等价分红制。现在干的劲头都很大，组与组提出了竞赛，看谁出的件数多，谁到年底赚的红利多，每天早晨天不亮全村就成了一片打铁声音。（绍孔、自珍）
