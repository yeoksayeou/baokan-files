　　Transporting Pots and Salt from Xiyang to Xingtai
  　Earned Over 80 Million in a Month
    [Reported by this newspaper from Xiyang] Since the masses in the first, fifth, and third districts turned to transportation a month ago, a total of 350,000 catties of pots have been transported from Pingding to Xiyang, earning 5.95 million yuan at 17 yuan per catty. A total of 760,000 catties of pots have been transported from Xiyang to Xingtai, earning 79.8 million yuan at an average of 105 yuan per catty. In total, the two items earned 85.75 million yuan in one month (excluding consumption of people and livestock). The following two methods were also created: 1. Exchange of salt and pots. Pots were transported to Xingtai and exchanged for salt, which was absorbed by the ironware store, repeatedly increasing private transportation funds and ensuring goods to carry back and forth. 2. Integration with cooperatives. Pots were sold to cooperatives on credit, absorbing idle funds from the masses, organizing sales, and continuing to pay. This way, both parties can circulate funds and is better than being a porter. In addition, in order to find sales channels for coal and earn money to overcome famine, a large amount of transportation was carried out. Therefore, coal stations were established in eleven towns and villages such as Yitou in the fourth district and Biaopu and Wangzhai in the seventh district. In addition to a bank loan of 1 million yuan, the district cooperatives also contributed 3.5 million yuan. Each station has opened shops to solve the problem of accommodation for transportation. In terms of operation, the phenomenon of cheap raw food and expensive cooked food was overcome. Rice was substituted for noodles and rice, and small stoves were organized to meet the needs of the masses, which is both economical and convenient, so transportation can earn more money.

　　由昔阳到邢台运锅带盐
  　一月赚了八千多万
    【本报昔阳讯】一、五、三区群众转向运输一月以来，由平定到昔阳共运锅三十五万斤，每斤十七元，赚洋五百九十五万元，由昔阳到邢台共运锅七十六万斤，每斤平均一百零五元，赚洋七千九百八十万元，总计一月时间二宗共赚洋八千五百七十五万元（人牲口消耗未除），并创造以下两种办法：一、盐锅相互交换。将锅运到邢台，换回盐来，由铁货栈负责吸收，翻来覆去，壮大了私人运输资金，且来回有货可驮。二、与合作社结合。将锅赊给合作社，吸收群众游资，组织出售，继续交款。这样双方资金能周转，且比驮脚强。另外，为了给煤炭找销路，大量运输赚钱渡荒，因此在四区冶头、七区杓铺、王寨等十一市镇村庄建立炭站，资金除银行贷款一百万元外，各区联社又抽出三百五十万元。各站开设有店房，解决运输住店困难。经营上，克服生贱熟贵现象，改面饭为米饭，组织起火小店，适合群众要求，这样既节约又随便，运输就能多赚钱。
