Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 14th: The People's Liberation Army recovered Haiyang City on the 11th. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, belonging to the 54th Reorganized Division, who had entrenched themselves in the city, fled by sea to Qingdao. The Chiang bandits in Haiyang consisted of five regiments. Since being surrounded by our forces on November 8th of last month, they had been besieged for one month and three days. The bandits repeatedly attempted to break through on land, but were completely crushed by our forces, suffering over 3,200 casualties. The remaining bandits were forced to flee by sea.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th: During the Chiang bandits' occupation of Haiyang, our suburban militia cooperated with the main force surrounding the city, launching explosions and inflicting casualties on the enemy. According to statistics from November 4th to December 4th, a total of 108 landmines were detonated, killing and wounding 116 enemy soldiers, destroying 2 enemy vehicles, and seizing some guns and ammunition. The ammunition and supplies dropped by Chiang's planes to the Chiang bandits in Haiyang were also frequently seized by our suburban soldiers and civilians. On November 25th alone, our militia repelled Chiang's bandits twice, seizing 30 artillery shells and some supplies dropped by parachute from Chiang's planes.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: Chiang's bandits in Huang County were annihilated by our forces, losing over 500 men, while fleeing to Longkou. At dawn on the 7th, our army ambushed the enemy in Zhuangtou and Shenjiatuan areas west of Huang County, capturing over 50 enemy soldiers and seizing over 40 rifles. They also pressed towards the outskirts of Longkou. On the morning of the 8th, they engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in Qinjiacun, Mating, and Wangjia areas on the outskirts of Longkou City, killing and wounding over 300 enemy soldiers and capturing over 200 alive.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: Chiang's bandits in Laiyang City are extremely panicked under the siege of the People's Liberation Army. Soldiers are deserting in dozens every day. According to Chiang's fugitive soldiers, most of the Chiang bandits in the city are newly conscripted soldiers, with only five or six hundred men in each regiment and only ten to twenty men in each company, with more officers than soldiers. The soldiers all hope that the People's Liberation Army will liberate them soon. The officers, on the other hand, are restless and uneasy. As soon as they hear the artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army, they immediately convene emergency talks to deploy sentries and scurry around the streets. The enemy is deeply afraid of our army's attack and keeps the south, north, and east gates of the city tightly closed, leaving only the west gate open for escape. There is a saying among the soldiers: "The lost Jiangshan, the flowing soldiers," meaning that Chiang Kai-shek's rule is on the verge of collapse, and the only option for Chiang's soldiers is to slip away.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 13th: The victorious offensive of the Liberation Army along the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway has been warmly welcomed and comforted by all sectors of the Party, government, and people. In the vast newly recovered areas and battlefields, gongs and drums are sounding, and the masses brave the wind and snow to come from afar to comfort the troops in an endless stream. The Jiaodong District Party Committee, Military Region, Administrative Office, various mass organizations, and the Jiaodong Dazhong Daily Newspaper, etc., have jointly sent representatives with a large number of comfort items and letters of condolence to the front lines. The "National Defense Drama Troupe" and "Victory Drama Troupe" of the Jiaodong Military Region have also gone to the front lines to perform. The masses of Wulong (newly established county) braved the freezing weather and caught nine large carp in the Wulong River to comfort the troops. The Young Pioneers and Children's Corps of Haiyang and Xingcun districts also sent representatives carrying peanuts, pigs, sheep, and other items they produced to comfort the troops. A surge of army-civilian celebrations is now underway at the front.

    胶东我克海阳县城
    黄县逃敌被歼五百
    广大新区掀起军民联欢热潮
    【新华社华东前线十四日电】解放军于十一日收复海阳城，侵踞该城之蒋匪整五十四师所部由海上逃往青岛。按海阳蒋匪共五个团，自上月八日被我包围以来，已达一个月零三天。该匪曾多次妄图由陆上突围，均被我彻底粉碎，先后共毙伤敌三千二百余名，余匪乃被迫由海上逃窜。
    【新华社华东十四日电】蒋匪侵踞海阳期间，我城郊民兵配合围城主力，展开爆炸，屡予敌以杀伤，据十一月四日至十二月四日一月统计，共响地雷百零八个，毙伤敌一百一十六名，炸毁敌汽车二辆，缴枪弹一部，蒋机由空中投给海阳蒋匪之弹药物资，亦经常为我城郊军民夺获。仅上月二十五日一天内，我民兵即曾两次击退蒋匪，夺获由蒋机用降落伞掷下之炮弹三十发及物资一部。
    【新华社华东十三日电】黄县蒋匪于逃窜龙口途中，为我歼灭其五百余。七日拂晓，我军于黄县城西庄头、申家疃一带设伏，俘敌五十余，缴步枪四十余支，并直迫龙口近郊。八月上午与敌激战于龙口市郊秦家村、马亭、王家一带，复毙伤敌三百余，生俘二百余。
    【新华社华东十三日电】莱阳城蒋匪在解放军围困下，极为恐慌。士兵逃亡，每天以数十计。据蒋匪逃兵谈：城内蒋匪大部是抓来的新兵，每个团只五、六百人，每连仅十至二十人，官比兵多。士兵们都希望解放军赶快去解放他们。当官的则坐卧不安，一听到解放军炮击，即紧急召集训话，布置岗哨，满街乱窜。敌深恐我军进攻，将城南、北、东三门紧闭，仅留一西门以便逃窜。士兵中有句流言：“破了的江山，流水的兵”，意思是说蒋贼的统治已濒崩溃，当蒋兵的只有溜之大吉。
    【新华社华东前线十三日电】沿胶济东段广泛展开胜利攻势的解放大军，受到党政民各界的热烈欢迎与慰劳。在广大新收复区和战地，锣鼓喧天，群众不避风雪远道赶来劳军者络绎不绝。胶东区党委、军区、行署、各群众团体及胶东大众报社等，特联合推派代表，携带大批慰劳品与慰问信抵达前线。胶东军区之“国防剧团”与“胜利剧团”亦至前线演出。五龙（新设县）县群众冒着冰冻下五龙河捉到九尾大鲤鱼劳军，海阳、邢村区少先团、儿童团亦推派代表携带自己生产的花生、猪羊等物慰劳部队。现前线正掀起军民联欢热潮。
