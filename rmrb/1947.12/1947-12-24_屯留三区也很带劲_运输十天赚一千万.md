　　【Report from Taiyue, this paper, the 22nd】Since the end of last month, Tunliu Third District launched a large-scale winter production campaign. In ten days, significant achievements have been made in textile and transportation. All 46 administrative villages in the district have organized 456 textile groups, with 3,335 participants. There are 63 weaving schools for military and cadre dependents alone, with 612 participants. The total number of women weavers organized in the district has reached 3,947, accounting for 60% of all women weavers in the district.

　　The district has organized 800 long-distance transport vehicles, of which 350 are combined with participation in the war effort, earning a profit of 2.8 million yuan. The 410 short-distance transport vehicles, used for hauling coal and transporting steel, have earned a profit of 9,031,000 yuan. The two transportation endeavors have earned a total profit of 11,831,000 yuan. Except for those lacking labor power, 100% of the district's livestock has been organized.

　　At the two large gatherings in the city and Yuwu Town, in addition to turning bad situations into good ones, 123 head of livestock were added. 55,000 jin of magnetic ore, copper, iron, and tin were collected and transported to the military industry department, and 69,000 jin of saltpeter ash were also transported to various saltpeter workshops.

　　In this period of vigorous and enthusiastic movement, many model deeds and new creations have emerged. For example, in the textile movement, Li Bao'er, a cadre at the Gancaotan base point, used the method of meticulous accounting to fill gaps and mobilized everyone to spin. He expanded from one person making a plan to everyone making a plan, and every household organizing to make a plan. Consequently, two old women in Xiqu said, "Although we are old, we can still work. We guarantee to spin 30 jin of cotton." Li Qiuhua from Chuandiping also made a plan, guaranteeing to spin 16 jin of cotton. All the weaving women in Xiaochang Village spun 47 jin of thread in six days, preparing for an exhibition next year in the second month of the lunar calendar.

　　In transportation, efforts were combined with participation in the war effort. This time, 350 vehicles were organized in the district to transport cotton materials from Yangcheng, hauling 700 shi of grain. The district government systematically contracted with the military industry department to transport pig iron from Yangcheng, Jincheng, and Gaoping, and dispatched cadres Cui Baozhen and Zhang Honglin to lead the effort, earning a profit of 2.8 million yuan. In short-distance transportation, plans were carefully made to avoid empty trips. For example, the oil mill in Shanglian base point village and Liu Chenggou village in Wuyuan base point established relationships with the military industry department, hauling wood in exchange for coal, selling the coal and hauling back wood, resulting in substantial profits from these round trips, earning a profit of 5,831,000 yuan.
