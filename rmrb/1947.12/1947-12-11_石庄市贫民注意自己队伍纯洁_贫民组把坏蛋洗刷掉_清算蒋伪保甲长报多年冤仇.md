Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 9th: Poor people in various districts of Shijiazhuang are gathering to discuss their liberation, organizing militia teams, and settling scores with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Baojia heads who were guilty of corruption and extortion. When the city working groups arrived in various streets, they first focused on helping the active and genuinely poor citizens, uniting and organizing the vast majority of the poor. Some remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's forces and opportunists infiltrated the poor people's groups, spreading rumors and causing sabotage. The poor people's groups immediately used the method of comparing poverty and hardship to purify their own ranks. The poor people of the Sixth Street in the Second District held a spontaneous meeting, where the masses sharply pointed out: "Tian Shuangchun used to be a Baojia head, married two wives, and has two rubber-wheeled carts. He is not worthy of leading us poor brothers." Consequently, Tian Shuangchun was purged from the liberation committee. The poor people of the Fifth Street held a meeting to struggle against Li Xinchun, a former police officer who had worked as a clerk for many years and now pretended to be poor to infiltrate the association. He was also expelled from the poor people's association. The masses in the open-air market settled scores with Liu Guizi, the evil Baojia head of the Seventeenth Bao under the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime. During his tenure as Baojia head for more than a year, Liu committed all kinds of evil deeds, often leading Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers to households to extort grain and money, rape women, and embezzle relief supplies. After the masses recounted their sufferings, they unanimously demanded that he use his property to compensate the masses for their losses over the years. The poor people's association in the Fourth Street of the First District washed away thirteen bad eggs and recruited many coolies, rickshaw pullers, vendors, and others to participate. According to incomplete statistics, the number of people participating in the poor people's association in the First District of the city has now reached 3,390, and 5,340 poor people in the Second District have been organized, with 113 poor people forming militia teams.
