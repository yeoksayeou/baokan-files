　　Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district Postal Workers
  　Deliveries Increase in Speed with Immediate Dispatch
    [Our dispatch] To cooperate with the counter-offensive and support the front lines, and to increase the speed of Party newspaper delivery and timely dissemination of victory news, all employees on the main postal lines of the Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district have voluntarily improved their schedules and departure times. Regardless of day or night shifts, they are departing earlier and delivering immediately upon arrival. For example, the Shexian Bureau to Gucheng Station is a day shift. Previously, they departed early in the morning and arrived in the evening. Now, after receiving the newspapers delivered by the Yetao night shift, they depart before dawn. On the 30th of last month, postal worker Ge Dan set off in the middle of the night and arrived in Gucheng by 12 noon, which enabled the Gucheng to Linxian night shift to also depart earlier. Since the early departures from each bureau station, the time has been reduced by one day compared to before. From Wuan Yetao to Huixian Bobi, which is more than 430 li, used to take five days to arrive, but now it only takes four days. For example, the People's Daily of the 12th and the Xinhua News of the 13th of this month could be seen in Huixian on the 15th.
    The Huixian Bureau, in order to cooperate with the main line to achieve overall speed, changed the previous system of receiving in the afternoon of one day and delivering the next day to immediate delivery upon arrival, which is half a day faster than before. Recently, many readers have said: "The newspapers are arriving so fast! How do you (the post office) run? You are really swift-footed!"

　　太行五分区邮工
  　随来随送速度大增
    【本报讯】太行五分区主干邮线上的全体员工，为配合反攻支援前线，增快党报转送速度，及时传播胜利消息，现各局站自动的改进了班期与出发时间，不论日班与夜班，都在提前出发，随来随送。如涉县局到古城站是个日班，以前是早出发，晚上到，现在接到冶陶夜班送来报纸后，不等天明就出发了。在上月三十日邮工圪旦同志，多半夜就动身赶上午十二点即到了古城，这样古城到林县的夜班就也能提前出发。自各局站提前出发后，时间比以前增快了一天，武安冶陶到辉县薄壁四百三十余里，以前五天才能到达，现在四天就能来到。如本月十二号的人民日报与十三号的新华报，辉县十五号就能看到。
    辉县局为了配合主干线作到上下一齐快，将以前头天下午来第二天送的制度，改成随来随送，比以前增快了半天时间。近来有不少读者这样说：“报纸来的真快呀，你们（邮局）是怎样跑的？真是飞毛腿！”
