    The Whole Family is Happy
    A Story of Joining the Army from Yangguantun, Boping
    On the 24th, after the assembly where sixty young men from Yangguantun signed up to join the army, I entered a courtyard with a pine archway erected at the entrance and new couplets pasted up. The women were busy starching cloth, dyeing cloth, and doing needlework. When they saw me, they called out a simple and honest middle-aged man from the house. He looked at me with smiling eyes and said, "The whole family is overjoyed!" Immediately afterwards, the old lady standing next to him said with a smile, "Our whole family is happy. I originally signed up his father at the group meeting to send him to the army. We thought the child had only been married for three months, and his wife might not be willing. Later, my youngest son insisted on going. I thought that his father had had sores all over his legs since he was a child and couldn't walk far, so it's okay for the youngest to go. That's how our Jinyuan went." "Is his wife willing to let him go?" I asked. "She was willing a long time ago, and she signed up in the women's association too. If she wasn't willing, would she be so busy making things for him!" I turned my head to look, and the young woman was busy making cotton shoes for her husband who was joining the army, her face instantly flushed red. Turning back, Jinyuan's father, Yang Kaizhu, then narrated his experience of not being able to go: "Comrade, I signed up as soon as I got back from the meeting in the city. I've had this in my heart for a long time. Later, my youngest son insisted on going. After three discussions at home, our seventy-six-year-old mother also said, 'Let Yuan go, your legs are not good and you can't walk!' That's how our Yuan went." The grandmother of Jinyuan, who was dyeing cloth next to her, although her ears were a bit hard of hearing and her eyes were blurred, she had already seen Kaizhu (her son) pointing at her to indicate the matter of joining the army. She quickly smiled and said, "I said his father's legs were not good, let our Yuan go, defeat old Chiang early and live a peaceful life!" Indeed, my heart was infected by the joy of their whole family. "How did you get through your ideological difficulties?" "We've suffered too much from poverty, that's how we figured it out." This was the unanimous answer from the old couple. Yang Kaizhu continued to say that before the famine year, his family only had two acres of land, supporting a family of six. Seeing that they couldn't hold on at home anymore, they sold the house for two thousand yuan and went outside the pass (Northeast China). Who knew that the landlords outside the pass were also so ruthless to the peasants, and the whole family suffered from hunger and cold, and one of his seven-year-old children starved to death. The year before last, hearing that their hometown had been liberated, they sold all their quilts and clothes and immediately returned home. Finally, he said with a sad expression: "I have never enjoyed a day of happiness in the past, but I have suffered a lot." Jinyuan's mother, thinking of the past suffering, said with tears in her eyes: "Speaking of suffering, no one is greater than me. In the famine year, I picked up watermelon rinds on the street and cooked them without peeling them. At that time, I gave birth to that child, and I went outside the pass in nine days, Comrade, there was really no way!..." Jinyuan's grandmother, hearing "outside the pass", was also clamoring: "Eating a little sorghum rice all day long, it doesn't agree with you, but there's nothing you can do!" Suddenly, everyone lowered their heads, and no one hummed anymore, all deeply recalling the past suffering. Finally, Yang Kaizhu broke the silence and said: "The landlords have been liquidated, and I have also been allocated eight acres of land. This year, I have threshed several shi of grain, so I'm sure I won't starve. But the landlord Yang Guanxun and five of his relatives ran to Jinan, and Yang Guanxun's son, Xiaoyou, became a pistol team member. His roots are planted with old Chiang. If we don't catch old Chiang, we can't bring these 'five tigers' back. Comrade, who will do it if we don't?" At this time, Yang Jinyuan came back from outside, his red face wearing a smile. His mother saw him coming back and went up to pat him on the shoulder and said to me: "Comrade, it's him, is he qualified!" I quickly said: "Qualified - great." Causing the whole family to laugh loudly, and I laughed too.

    博平杨官屯参军故事
    二十四日，杨官屯六十名青年报名参军大会后，我走进一家门口扎有松牌坊、贴着新对联的院子里，女人们正忙着浆布、染布和做针线活。她们看见我去，就从屋里叫出了一位质朴的壮年。他眼睛微笑的看着我说：“全家都是欢天喜地的！”紧接着，站在旁边的大娘满带笑容的说：“咱这全家都喜欢，我本来在小组会上报名送他父参军啦，咱觉着小孩娶亲刚三月，恐怕媳妇不愿意，后来俺小争着要去，我思了思他父自小就长了满腿疮，不能走远路，小去也行，才算是俺金元去啦。”“他媳妇愿叫他去不？”我问。“人家早愿意啦，在妇女会里也报名啦。你看人家不愿意，能在那忙着给他做活吗！”我扭头看看，这位青年妇女正低着头给他参军的丈夫赶做棉鞋，霎时脸也通红了。回头，金元的父杨开竹便叙述他没去成的经过：“同志，我从城里开会回来就报名啦，这是我早就有这心，后来俺小争着要去，经过家里三次商量，俺那个七十六岁的老娘也说：“还是元去吧，你的腿不好不能走路！”这样，俺元才去。”坐在旁边正在染布的金元奶奶，虽然耳朵有些听不准，眼也花了，但她已看到开竹（她儿）的手在指她一定说的参军事，她连忙嘻嘻的笑着说：“我说他爹腿不好，叫俺元去，早打败老蒋过安生日子！”真的，我的心被他们全家人的喜欢所感染了。“您们怎么打通的思想呢？”“受穷受苦太多啦，就这么想开的。”这是他老俩口子的同声回答。杨开竹接着说到他家在灾荒年前只有二亩地，养活着全家六口人，看看再在家已撑不住了，宅子卖了二千元，下了关外，谁知关外的地主对农民也是那样的无情，全家挨饿受冻，并饿死了他七岁的一个小孩。前年听说家里解放了，把被子衣服全卖啦，马上回到家里。最后他以悲痛的表情说：“我过去算没享一天福，可没少受了罪。”金元娘想起了从前的苦，眼里含着泪说：“说起苦来，谁也没俺大，灾荒年时，俺在街上拾了西瓜皮，不去皮就煮着吃，那时生了俺那个小孩，九天就下关外啦，同志，真没法啊！……”金元的奶奶听说“关外”，嘴里也在嚷嚷着：“一天到晚吃点高粱米，吃不服也没法！”顿时，每个人的头在低着，没一人再哼气，都在深深的回忆着从前的苦难。终于杨开竹打破了沉闷说：“地主被清算了，我也分了八亩地，今年又打了几石粮食，保险饿不着。可是地主杨冠勋他亲门五个跑到济南，杨冠勋的儿小友当了手枪队，他的根是扎到老蒋那里，捉不住老蒋，也不能把这‘五只虎’捉回来。同志，咱不干谁干？”这时，杨金元从外边回来了，红红的脸挂着微笑，他娘见他回来了，走上去拍着他的肩给我说：“同志，就是他，够格吧！”我连忙说：“够——行。”引的全家人都在大笑，我也笑了。
