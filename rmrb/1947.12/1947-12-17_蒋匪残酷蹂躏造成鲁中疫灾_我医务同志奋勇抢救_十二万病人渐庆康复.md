Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th -- Various infectious disease disasters that once spread in the Central Shandong area have been nearly extinguished after three months of rescue efforts. The disease disasters were caused by the displacement and starvation of the people under Chiang Kai-shek's cruel ravages. The Yibei and Yiyuan (both newly established counties) areas suffered the most from Chiang's disaster, and the disease disaster was also the most severe. Mengyin, Linqu and other counties were also affected, with more than 120,000 patients at that time. Once the above areas were recovered, the government immediately organized medical cooperatives and helped local Chinese and Western medicine doctors to launch a widespread rescue campaign. In late August, more than 3,000 people were quickly cured in Yibei. In mid-September, the provincial government sent a medical team to Yiyuan, curing 9,549 people within a month; Shandong International Peace Hospital, East China Bethune Medical College, and East China Medical University jointly formed the Central Shandong Epidemic Prevention Brigade, which arrived in Yibei, Yizhong, Linqu and other counties in early November to carry out rescue work, and to promote medical and health knowledge. Medical comrades worked day and night, climbing mountains and ridges, and even went to the suburbs of Yishui, which were still occupied by the enemy, to actively rescue under the cover of militiamen. In the past month, more than 7,000 people have been cured. The Central Shandong Administrative Office has also issued a large number of medicines to areas with milder infectious diseases, and local governments have organized their own medical teams. Various troops and hospitals have also sent a large number of doctors to the stationed areas for rescue. At present, major infectious diseases such as malaria and relapsing fever have been largely eliminated. The government has concrete measures for the future regular epidemic prevention work, such as running training classes for health personnel and helping the masses with a large number of Chinese and Western medicines, and increasing medical cooperatives.

    蒋匪残酷蹂躏造成鲁中疫灾
    我医务同志奋勇抢救
    十二万病人渐庆康复
    【新华社华东十五日电】鲁中区一度蔓延之各种传染病灾，经三月抢救，已近扑灭。病灾是由于蒋匪残酷蹂躏下人民流离饥饿所致，沂北、沂源（均新设县）地区受蒋灾最重，病灾亦最重，蒙阴、临朐等县亦发现，当时患者达十二万余人。上述地区一经收复，政府即组织医药合作社和帮助地方中、西医生普遍展开抢救运动。八月下旬，在沂北迅速医好三千余人。九月中旬，省政府派遣医疗队赶来沂源，一月内治愈九千五百四十九名；山东国际和平医院、华东白求恩医学院、华东医科大学，联合组成鲁中防疫大队，已于十一月初开到沂北、沂中、临朐等县进行抢救，并宣传医药卫生常识。各医务同志不分昼夜，爬山越岭，甚至开到敌人仍盘踞的沂水城郊，以民兵掩护积极抢救。月来已治愈七千余人。鲁中行署并对传染病较轻的地区发出大批药品，由各地政府自行组织医疗队，各部队及医院亦派出大批医生在驻区抢救，目前疟疾、回归热等主要传染病已大致扑灭。对今后之经常防疫工作，政府已有具体措施。如开办卫生人员训练班及以大批中西药品帮助群众、增设医药合作社等。
