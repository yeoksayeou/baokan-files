　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Sofia dispatch: After arriving in Bulgaria on the 25th of last month, Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito, on the 27th, signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov near Varna, on the Black Sea coast, at Stinograd, drafted by the delegations of the two countries in Bled, South-Slavia, on August 1st of this year. According to the main contents of the treaty announced by the two countries on the 29th: (1) The two countries will jointly take all necessary measures to ensure their security, independence, and territorial integrity in accordance with the United Nations Charter. If one of the contracting parties is subjected to aggression by any third country, the other contracting party has the obligation to provide military and all other assistance. (2) Neither contracting party shall conclude any treaty with any third country aimed at harming the other party. (3) The two contracting parties shall implement extensive mutual assistance in economic and cultural aspects. The treaty is valid for twenty years, and if neither contracting party expresses a willingness to abolish it before the expiration of the treaty, the treaty shall be automatically extended for five years. After the signing formalities are completed, the treaty shall take effect immediately.

　　The two governments also issued a communiqué stating that the South-Bulgaria Treaty has embodied the long-cherished aspirations of the people of both countries and guarantees the freedom and independence of both countries and peace in the Balkans. After carefully studying the international situation, the two governments unanimously decided to defend the interests of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp and oppose the instigators of a new war; and to resist any instigation and aggression from any party with all their strength. The delegations of the two countries unanimously believe that the so-called "Balkan Committee" established by the United Nations recently not only runs counter to the United Nations Charter and the principle of unanimity among the five powers, but also endangers the sovereignty of Balkan countries. Therefore, the two countries cannot provide any assistance to the committee and cannot allow the committee to enter the territory of the two countries. The delegations of the two countries pointed out: "The new war clamoring instigated by the imperialists is aimed at intimidating the neurologically weak. The two governments believe that it is necessary to remind the people of the two countries that unity is the best guarantee for Balkan peace and the independence of the two countries." The communiqué concluded: "The two governments will more resolutely pursue their policy of unity and friendship with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, as well as all countries that respect the independence and autonomy of the two countries."

　　Marshal Tito and his party returned to Belgrade on the 29th. The people of Belgrade went to the station to welcome them. When the marshal addressed the crowd at the station square, he specifically conveyed the fraternal greetings of the Bulgarian people to the people of South-Slavia and emphasized that the South-Bulgaria Treaty is a major contribution to the cause of peace in the Balkans and the world.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Bucharest dispatch: As a result of the visit of the Hungarian government delegation led by Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés to Romania on November 23rd, the representatives of the two countries signed a cultural cooperation agreement on the 27th. They continued to conduct negotiations on cooperation and mutual assistance between the two countries and are preparing to conclude a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance in the near future. At the banquet held by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in honor of the Hungarian delegation, the new Romanian Foreign Minister Mrs. Pauker said in her speech: "The people of our two countries can be sure that due to cooperation with the Soviet Union, democracy and national independence can be ensured. We must support each other and establish a common front to oppose imperialism, which is trying to interfere in our internal affairs and undermine our independence and freedom." Dinnyés also emphasized in his reply: "The new democratic countries are making every effort to defend the world from falling into the danger of a new war." Dinnyés and his party returned to the Hungarian capital on the 25th. This was Dinnyés's second foreign visit after becoming prime minister. The first was a visit to Yugoslavia on the 14th of last month, when a Hungarian-South-Slavia cultural cooperation agreement was signed the next day, and a number of agreements on cooperation and mutual assistance between the two countries were reached.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Budapest dispatch: The Hungarian Ministry of the Interior ordered the dissolution of the so-called "Hungarian Independence Party" formed by the reactionary politician Pfeiffer on the 24th. As early as the 21st, the electoral court organized according to the electoral law had revoked the qualifications of all members of the party. Pfeiffer was originally a far-right leader of the former Smallholders Party. After being purged from the Smallholders Party, he formed the "Independence Party" one month before the general election on August 30th this year. The party had 53 members, making it the second largest opposition party in parliament. The members were all former right-wing elements of the Smallholders Party who had been expelled from the party, and all were collaborators with the Nazis during the war. After forming the party, they did their best to carry out fascist activities. On the 30th of last month, they were condemned as war-mongers by Hungarian Communist members and demanded to be purged. Pfeiffer had already fled abroad on the 4th under the protection of the American occupation authorities in Germany and Austria. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has therefore lodged a strong protest with the American envoy.

    匈罗签订文化合作协定匈内部下令解散反动政党
    【新华社陕北二日电】索非亚讯：南斯拉夫总理铁托元帅于上月二十五日抵保后，已于二十七日与保加利亚总理季米特洛夫在黑海沿岸发那附近之思丁诺格勒，签署两国代表团今年八月一日在南国布列达拟定之友好合作与互助条约。据二十九日两国发表之条约主要内容为：（一）两国将共同采取一切必要措施，依照联合国宪章保障其安全独立与领土之完整。若缔约国之一方受任何第三国之侵略时，则缔约国之另一方有予以军事上及其他一切援助之义务。（二）缔约国任何一方不得与任何第三国缔结旨在危害对方之条约。（三）缔约国双方在经济文化各方面实行广泛互助。条约有效期为二十年，若缔约国任何一方在条约期满前皆未表示愿意废除，该约得自动延长五年。签字手续完竣后，该约即行生效。
    两国政府并同时发表公报称：南保条约已体现两国人民之夙愿，并保证两国之自由独立与巴尔干之和平。两国政府在缜密研究国际形势后，一致决定保卫民主与反帝国主义阵营之利益，反对新战争挑拨者；并全力反抗来自任何一方之挑拨与侵略。两国代表团一致认为：日前联合国通过设立之所谓“巴尔干委员会”，不仅与联合国宪章及五强一致原则背道而驰，而且危害巴尔干各国之主权。因此，两国不能与该委员会以任何帮助，并不能容许该委员会进入两国境内。两国代表团指出：“帝国主义者所鼓动之新战争叫嚣，其目的在威吓神经衰弱之徒，两国政府认为必须提醒两国人民，团结一致乃巴尔干和平与两国独立之最佳保证。”公报结语称：“两国政府将更坚决奉行其与苏联及其他民主国家，以及一切尊重两国独立自主之国家，实行团结与友好之政策。”
    铁托元帅等一行于二十九日遄返贝尔格莱德，贝城人民倾城赴车站欢迎，元帅在车站广场致辞时，特将保国人民谊同手足之祝贺转达南国人民，并强调声称：南保条约乃对巴尔干及世界和平事业之重大贡献。 　【新华社陕北二日电】布加勒斯特讯：匈总理丁尼斯于十一月二十三日亲率匈政府代表团访问罗马尼亚结果，两国代表已于二十七日签订文化合作协定。并赓续进行有关两国合作互助之谈判。准备于最近缔结友好合作互助条约。在罗外交部招待匈代表团之宴会上，罗新外长鲍克夫人致词称：“我两国人民可以确信，由于与苏联之合作，必能确保民主与国家之独立。我们必须互相支援，并建立共同阵线，以反对力图干涉我们内政，破坏我们独立与自由之帝国主义。”丁尼斯在答词中，亦强调：“新民主国家正竭力保卫世界，以免陷入新战争之危险”。丁氏等一行已于二十五日返匈京。按此为丁尼斯任总理后出国访问之第二次。第一次为上月十四日之访问南斯拉夫，次日即签订匈南文化合作协定，并达成有关两国合作互助之多项协议。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利内政部二十四日下令解散反动政客费菲尔组成之所谓“匈牙利独立党”。早在二十一日，根据选举法组织之选举法庭，已撤销该党全体议员之资格。费菲尔原属前小农党极右翼领袖，遭小农党清洗后，乃于今年八月三十日大选前一月另组“独立党”，该党有议员五十三人，为议会第二最大反对党。党员均为遭小农党开除之前该党右翼分子，且均属战时与纳粹合作分子，组党后即竭力进行法西斯活动。上月三十日曾遭匈共议员谴责为战争贩子，要求予以清洗。费菲尔已于四日在美国驻德奥占领军当局庇护下潜逃出国，匈外交部已因此向美公使提出强硬抗议。
