　　American Labor Unrest Brews
  　Mine Workers Union Withdraws from Reactionary AFL
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 21st: Reports from various sources: New labor unrest is brewing in the United States. Negotiations between the president of the United Mine Workers Union, Lewis, and the capitalists regarding miners' pensions and other issues have reached a stalemate, "threatening to bring American mines to a standstill as the harsh winter approaches" (Reuters). Meanwhile, 50,000 workers at Western Union have scheduled a nationwide strike for the 23rd. After the failure of negotiations between labor and management representatives convened by the so-called "Arbitration Board" on the 17th, Branch, president of the Commercial Telegraph Workers Union's Western Union division of the AFL, announced: "We will strike to demand wage increases," "This strike is bound to paralyze American telegraph communications at the end of the year." (Associated Press)
    Another report: The American Mine Workers Union officially announced its withdrawal from the American Federation of Labor on the 12th. The reason given was that its president, Lewis, opposed the capitulation of other AFL leaders to the "non-Communist affidavit" in the new anti-labor law in the United States. Lewis stated that he did not support the Communist Party, but that this action was a violation of the U.S. Constitution. It is noted that Lewis first withdrew from the AFL when the CIO was established in 1935, rejoined the AFL in January 1946, and this is the second time he has withdrawn from the AFL.

　　美国工潮在酝酿中
  　矿工联合会退出反动的劳联
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方消息：美国新工潮在酝酿中，美矿工联合会主席路易斯与资方对矿工养老金等问题的谈判，已陷于僵局，“美国矿场有在严冬来临之际陷于停顿之虞”（路透社）。同时，西联电报公司五万工人，已订于二十三日举行全国性罢工。在所谓“仲裁局”十七日召开劳资代表谈判失败之后，劳联之商业电报工人工会西联公司分会主席布朗奇即宣布：“我们将以罢工来求得增资”，“这一罢工势将使美国电报交通于岁暮之际陷于瘫痪”。（美联社）
    又讯：美矿工联合会于十二日正式宣布退出美劳工联合会，原因为该会主席路易斯反对劳联其他领袖对美国新反劳工法中“无共产党具结”之屈服。路氏曾声称：他并非支持共产党，而是因为此举系违反美国宪法。按路易斯曾于三五年产联成立时第一次退出劳联，四六年一月重入劳联，此为第二次退出劳联。
