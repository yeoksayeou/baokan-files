Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, December 24th: The Reorganized 5th Division (formerly the 5th Army), known as the elite main force of the Chiang bandits, has been greatly weakened and exhausted after being repeatedly defeated by the People's Liberation Army. Since suffering a severe blow from General Liu Bocheng's troops in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield, this division has been led by the nose by Chen and Su's forces, being dragged and fought, suffering annihilation strikes in battles in Laiwu, east of Jining, the Dongping Lake water network area, south of Yuncheng, Chengwu, and Minquan. Each time it suffered casualties of over a thousand to three or four thousand men. Although it has been repeatedly replenished, it has been repeatedly weakened, with serious desertions and frequent shortages of personnel. Hou Baicheng, a soldier of the 600th Regiment of the 200th Brigade of the division who came over with his weapons, said: "We are dragged back and forth on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways. We were transferred from Dangshan to Zhengzhou, stopped for one night, went south to Luohe, then to Xinyang, then turned back to Shangqiu, then to Kaifeng, then back to Shangqiu, and then dragged south again. We soldiers carry more than forty pounds of stuff on our backs, walking on our own two feet, worried all the time, walking several miles every day, and often getting beaten by the People's Liberation Army. As soon as we settle down, we have to build fortifications. When a few acquaintances meet, they start cursing: 'We're either worked to death, or beaten to death, or starved to death. We'd rather join the Eighth Route Army than wait to die in the Fifth Army.'" The number of wounded, sick, and deserters in each company of the division accounts for more than half. Although Chiang bandit officers used barbaric methods such as old soldiers monitoring new soldiers, northern soldiers monitoring southern soldiers, and "joint responsibility" to prevent desertion, all were ineffective. They kept escaping and being caught, catching and escaping, so their combat power weakened and their morale fell. In the last Longhai Railway sabotage battle, the People's Liberation Army only fired a few shots in the Zhu Ji area of Minquan, and the six regiments of the division were so scared that they immediately fired artillery and retreated in fear. In this Longhai and Pinghan railway sabotage battle, the division and the Reorganized 75th Division were dragged by the People's Liberation Army from the Bo County-Jieshou line to the Sui-Qi line in more than ten days, suffering more than 4,000 casualties in vain. In the Akiquji blocking battle, a company of the People's Liberation Army defeated an attack by a regiment of the division at the cost of ten casualties, killing and wounding more than 300 of them. In the south of Suixian County, the People's Liberation Army also smashed its combined offensive of infantry, cavalry, artillery, air force, and tanks. The so-called "elite" has been almost completely defeated. A second Menglianggu (where the entire army of the Reorganized 74th Division, one of Chiang's five main forces, was wiped out) will eventually fall on the head of the Reorganized 5th Division.

### 屡遭歼灭打击拖得疲惫不堪　蒋匪整五师大为削弱

　　屡遭歼灭打击拖得疲惫不堪
  　蒋匪整五师大为削弱
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十四日电】号称蒋匪精锐主力的整编第五师（原第五军），屡经解放军挫败，已大为削弱，疲惫不堪。该师自从在晋冀鲁豫战场经刘伯承将军所部严重打击后，即被陈、粟大军牵着鼻子，边拖边打，先后在莱芜、济宁东，东平湖水网地区、郓（城）南、城武、民权等地区战斗中遭受歼灭性打击，每次伤亡千余至三、四千人，虽迭经补充，但迭经削弱，逃亡严重，兵员经常缺额甚多。该师二百旅六百团携械来归之士兵侯百成称：“我们尽在陇海、平汉两条铁路上拖来拖去。从砀山调到郑州，停了一夜，南开漯河，再开信阳，接着又回头到商邱，又到开封，再回到商邱，又往南拖。我们当兵的，背着四十多斤重的东西，靠两只脚走路，提心吊胆，每天走几里路，还时常挨解放军的打。刚住下来，又要筑工事。当兵的几个熟人碰到一起就骂开了：“累也累死，打也打死，饿也饿死，宁愿投八路，不在五军等死。”该师各连伤病逃亡减员几占一半以上。蒋匪军官虽以老兵监视新兵，北方兵监视南方兵，及“连坐”等野蛮办法阻止逃亡，均属无效。连逃连抓，连抓连逃，因之战力日弱，士气日低。上次陇海路破击战中，解放军在民权朱集地区最初只放了几枪，就吓得该师六个团连忙发炮，畏缩不前。此次陇海、平汉两铁路破击战中，该师与整七十五师在十多天内，被解放军从亳县界首一线连打带拖引到睢、杞一线，白白伤亡四千余人。在秋渠集阻击战中，解放军一个连以伤亡十人的代价击溃该师一个团的进攻，毙伤其三百余人。在睢县南，解放军并曾粉碎其步、骑、炮、空、坦克各兵种的联合进攻。所谓“精锐”已经挫折殆尽了。第二个孟良崮（蒋匪五大主力之一整七十四师全军覆没之地）总有一天要轮到整五师头上的。
