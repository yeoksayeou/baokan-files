Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, 23rd. Frontline reporter reports on the People's Liberation Army's blocking of the Chiang bandit's 5th Division and crushing its tanks: The 5th Division crawled less than ten li on the 13th, and after a day of bitter fighting, at dawn on the 14th, it concentrated howitzers, mountain guns, and light and heavy weapons to frantically bombard the People's Liberation Army's 2nd Battalion's fortified position, Xidacun (ten li south of Suixian County). The PLA soldiers calmly and vigilantly lay in their fortifications, setting up their guns and "preparing refreshments for the Chiang bandits." After a barrage of artillery fire, the enemy used more than a regiment of troops, like meat shields, to roll towards the forward positions of the People's Liberation Army. Those who rolled were beaten and crawled back. Several enemy assaults were beaten back in disarray, leaving corpses everywhere. The enemy, with exhausted wisdom and strength, finally brought out the tanks. With a buzzing rumble, eight tanks appeared in the pine forest five hundred meters in front of the People's Liberation Army's position. Enemy infantry crawled forward behind the tanks like mice. The Second Platoon of the Fourth Company, which was holding the front line of the People's Liberation Army, shouted in unison: "Catch the tanks!" Soldier Xie Jun said to the whole squad: "How about our Sixth Squad creating an anti-tank hero?" Squad leader Liu Zhongming shouted: "Good! Comrades, now is the time to fulfill our grievances and vows to bravely kill the enemy!" Immediately, Liu Huadong, Pan Guangzong, and Fan Mingde used American-made bazookas to aim at the two leading tanks. With a loud bang, the two tanks were wounded and lay there moaning. The remaining six turned around and ran away, leaving the helpless infantry to be beaten in the open field, and they were annihilated one by one.

　　苏鲁豫皖前线勇士战胜蒋匪坦克进攻
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十三日电】前线记者报导解放军阻击蒋匪整五师、粉碎其坦克之情景：整五师在十三日爬行不及十里，挨了一天苦打之后，十四日天明，便集中榴弹炮、山炮、轻重火器向解放军某团二营固守的阵地西大屯（睢县南十里）疯狂轰击。解放军健儿们沉着而机警地卧在工事里，架好枪“给蒋匪准备好点心。”敌一阵炮击后，即以一个多团的兵力，象肉弹一样滚向解放军阵地前沿，滚着来的，被打得爬着回去，敌几次冲锋，都被我打得落荒而逃，遗尸遍地。智穷力竭的敌人，最后把坦克拿了出来，一阵嗡嗡隆隆，八辆坦克在解放军阵地前五百米达的松林里露头了。敌步兵象老鼠一样缩在坦克后面向前爬行。解放军坚守阵地最前沿的四连二排一齐高喊着：“捉坦克呀”！战士谢均向全班说：“咱六班创造个反坦克英雄好不好？”班长刘忠明喊道：“好！同志们这就是实现咱们诉苦宣誓英勇杀敌的时候了！”立即有刘化东、潘光宗、范明德用美式火箭筒瞄好最先头的两辆坦克轰隆一声，两辆坦克受伤了，躺在那里哀叫。其余六辆回头就跑，丢下无依无靠的步兵在旷地上挨打，一一就歼。
