Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Rome dispatch: 500,000 workers in the province and city of Rome declared a general strike starting at midnight on the 10th. Unemployed workers in Rome had held two major demonstrations on the 5th and 7th of this month. The Gasperi government ordered police to commit atrocities, killing and wounding many demonstrators. The Rome General Confederation of Labour protested twice to the Gasperi government, demanding severe punishment for the perpetrators and allocation of funds to relieve unemployment, setting a deadline for a response by the 9th. Under the threat of a general strike, the Gasperi government only agreed to a temporary allocation of 2.5 billion lire, rejecting the General Confederation of Labour's demand of 10 billion lire, leading to the outbreak of the general strike. According to a 11th dispatch from Agence France-Presse: after discussing the Gasperi government's counter-proposal, leaders of the Rome General Confederation of Labour decided to continue the general strike and demanded the release of arrested strikers. The reactionary Italian authorities, on one hand, incited representatives of the Christian Democratic Party within the Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour to vote against the strike and encouraged the sabotage of the strike through broadcasts and leaflets, while also ordering Christian Democratic workers to return to work; on the other hand, they mobilized all police forces and troops in Rome to support the strike-breaking activities. According to a 11th dispatch from TASS: Representatives of the Gasperi government and the General Confederation of Labour will continue talks on the 11th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Rome dispatch: The first congress of members of the Italian Resistance Movement solemnly opened here on the 8th. 1,400 delegates attended, representing all guerrilla organizations that fought within Italy and abroad for the liberation of their homeland. Guerrilla delegations from various foreign countries were invited to participate. Longo, leader of the Italian guerrilla movement and representative of the Volunteer Liberation Corps Command, was elected chairman of the presidium. After the opening address by the representative of the National Committee of the All-Italian Guerrilla Association, congratulatory messages were delivered successively by Terracini, President of the Constituent Assembly, the representative of the Association of Frontline Fighters and Disabled Veterans, and the representative of the United Association of Former Political Prisoners and Exiles. Participants in the congress greeted the guerrilla delegations from South Sudan, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Denmark, and other countries attending the congress with warm applause. When South Sudan's chief representative, Colonel Nedalković, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of Marshal Tito, he received particularly sincere and loud cheers and applause from the congress. Furthermore: At the invitation of the All-Italian Guerrilla Association, the Soviet guerrilla delegation, led by Kovpak, Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, arrived in Rome on the 8th.
