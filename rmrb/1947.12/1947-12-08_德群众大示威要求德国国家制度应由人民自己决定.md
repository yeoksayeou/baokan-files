　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Berlin dispatch: The German people's call for the political and economic unification of Germany is resounding throughout the country. In the Soviet occupation zone, mass meetings and demonstrations have been held in all cities, and letters have been sent to the Council of Foreign Ministers, demanding that the German people themselves decide their future national system. In the western occupation zones, despite the obstruction of the American, British, and French authorities and their running dog Schumacher, mass meetings are still being held in various places. Three thousand representatives of employees of the Nuremberg railway factory in the American occupation zone recently resolved to demand that the Council of Foreign Ministers make the political and economic unification of Germany a prerequisite for the reconstruction of Germany. The First Congress of the All-German Farmers' Mutual Aid Association, recently held in the Soviet occupation zone, sent a telegram to the Council of Foreign Ministers, demanding that the question of German unification be decided by a vote of all the German people. 316 farmer representatives from various occupation zones attended the meeting (except for the French occupation zone, because the French military authorities prohibited the delegation from attending). The conference discussed the tasks of German farmers and organized a Central Federation of Farmers' Mutual Aid Committees in the five provinces of the Soviet occupation zone. The Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet occupation zone stated that this meeting was the first farmers' meeting in German history and was a "cornerstone in the history of the development of a new, democratic, and peaceful Germany."
