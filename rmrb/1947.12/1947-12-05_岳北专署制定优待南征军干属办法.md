　　Yuebei Special District Formulates Measures for Preferential Treatment of Dependents of Southern Expeditionary Army Cadres
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 2nd] The Yuebei Special District recently formulated measures for preferential treatment of dependents of Southern Expeditionary Army cadres: First, it is determined that military cadres' families and dependents of martyrs working outside the Yuebei area are all referred to as military dependents or families of those on expeditions, and enjoy the same preferential treatment. In execution, priority is given to those who are farther away, then to those who are closer. Second, overcome the simplistic relief viewpoint. Those with little or no land will be guaranteed land equivalent to that owned by an average middle peasant. For those with labor difficulties, in villages with mutual aid teams: 1. The land and labor of the entire village will be assessed to determine the amount of land each laborer should cultivate. Then, after the military dependents report how much land they can cultivate themselves, the remaining land, excluding the land that the military dependents' labor can cultivate, will be assessed in terms of labor days. Work vouchers will be given according to the season, which they can manage themselves. If military dependents actively work and save work vouchers, the village should provide wages; 2. Cultivate on their behalf based on the average yield of the land, and the output of the entire village's land will be statistically calculated to determine the output that each person should have. In terms of preferential labor, it is only responsible for preferential treatment of the land for their average expected output. When cultivating on behalf, if the military dependents are destitute or poor peasants, the cultivation is done without compensation. Middle peasants pay half wages, rich peasants pay full wages, and landlords receive no preferential treatment. The land exceeding the expected output is cultivated by themselves; 3. The mutual aid team collectively contracts the work. The mutual aid team is responsible for cultivating the land that the military dependents should preferentially cultivate. If the income is less than the expected output, the mutual aid team will supplement part or all of it, except in the case of natural disasters; 4. Absorb military dependents to participate in mutual aid teams. If military dependents are semi-laborers or women, they should also participate and exchange labor with others as appropriate; 5. Those with certain mass conditions and a working foundation can adopt the method of Miaohou Gou in Tunliu (land as shares, labor scoring). In villages without mutual aid teams: 1. After assessing the labor of the land that should be preferentially treated for military dependents, assign it according to the labor and animal power of the entire village, and determine which people will preferentially treat which families; 2. Fix the care households. After assessing the labor of military dependents without labor or preferential treatment, fix one or several semi-laborers to be responsible for preferential treatment and exempt them from errands. If they are full laborers, they are only exempt from long-term errands, not short-term errands; 3. Determine certain masses or village cadres to regularly take care of one or several military dependents, help them make plans, and continuously understand and solve their urgent needs in daily life; 4. Military dependents without labor but with animal power can be exempted or reduced from livestock errands according to the actual situation; 5. The firewood and charcoal problem should be solved by the military dependents themselves as much as possible. If it is really impossible, military dependents can provide capital and the masses provide labor to carry charcoal, or assess the firewood and charcoal that should be given, which will be borne separately by the masses. If they cannot afford the capital, the amount used in a year can be assessed and firewood or charcoal can be given in installments; 6. In villages with particularly difficult water access, a certain number of semi-laborers can be fixed to supply water according to the number of military dependents and the distance of water access, which can replace short errands. If the amount of labor of military dependents in each village is uneven, the county and district should uniformly adjust during the busy farming season, and accurately grasp the number of military dependents' labor in each village, and consciously take care of them in the assignment of errands. Regarding the issue of organizing military dependents to spin and weave, if some military dependents have no home or family to rely on, they can be sent to factories to organize their spinning and weaving production. If there are no factories, small factories can be established. The Special District has now allocated 50 shi of rice to each of the counties of Erqin, An, Tun, and Chang, 30 shi to each of Ping, Jie, and Ling, and 20 shi to each of Huo and Zhao, as the foundation for military dependents' factories. Military dependents who cannot leave home can establish factories in the village. Regarding the issue of school enrollment for children of military dependents, in principle, those who are willing to enroll will continue to enroll, and will never be stopped due to the transfer of cadres to the south.
