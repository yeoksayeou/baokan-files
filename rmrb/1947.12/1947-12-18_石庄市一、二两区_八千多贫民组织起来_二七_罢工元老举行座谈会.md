Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 14th Dispatch:  In Shijiazhuang City, workers and poor people are enthusiastically launching a movement to overturn their situation, voice their grievances, and seek revenge. In the first and second districts alone, over 8,700 poor people have been organized. Recently, former workers of the Shijiazhuang Power Plant formed a liquidation committee and launched a struggle against Han Muqian, the plant director during the enemy and puppet regime period, clearing out nearly 200 million in KMT currency in deducted wages and fines.  Under the slogan "Everyone voices their grievances, every household settles accounts," the city's Hui people have formed 21 poor people's groups, with over 200 members.  The Hui People's Militia has assisted the city government in capturing several important special agents of the KMT's Shijiazhuang Military Intelligence Bureau.  After holding a representative meeting, poor peasants and peddlers in the fourth district are preparing to organize poor peasant leagues and actively prepare to divide the land. Poor people selling scraps in Renzi Street in the Second District launched a liquidation struggle against Liu Chunnian, the head of the Copper Industry Association, KMT street chief, big bully, and traitor during the enemy and puppet period, and achieved a complete victory. 70 million KMT currency in dividends that Liu Chunnian had profited from buying paper with the scrap sellers has been fully recovered. In the First District, over 600 poor people in Yong'an Street struggled against Wang Yuping, the platoon leader of the KMT's First District 18th Bao, a traitorous special agent. Because Wang fled upon hearing the news, the poor people's group will seal up all of Wang's property. The poor people's associations and poor peasant leagues in various places are united in the movement to turn the tables and are also eliminating rogues and disguised landlords from their ranks.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 14th Dispatch: The Shijiazhuang City Railway Trade Union recently held a forum for veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" strike on the Pinghan Railway in 1923, with over 130 old workers attending. In the past twenty years, they have waged heroic struggles against imperialism and warlords. Now, they have gathered together to talk about their experiences and are extremely excited. Li Bin, who served as an executive of the National Railway Trade Union during the "February 7th" strike, recounted the heroic history of the "February 7th" strike and called on everyone to organize and make the trade union pure and strong. Zhang Shurong, one of the leaders of the "February 7th" strike, pointed out that today, workers are in charge, and we must carry forward the sincere, loyal, brave, and responsible work style of the working class. Qian Daoheng and other workers from the Shimen Engineering Section of the Pinghan Railway unanimously pointed out that we must carry forward the indomitable spirit of the "February 7th" era, overcome the deep disasters brought to us by the enemy and puppet regimes, immediately prepare for the establishment of a general trade union for all industries in the city, organize family members, and carry out various productions. At the end of the meeting, Mayor Ke Qingshi announced that the government would provide pensions and relief or introduce work to the unemployed relatives of workers who participated in the "February 7th" strike. A monument will be erected in Shijiazhuang to commemorate the workers who sacrificed in the strike.
