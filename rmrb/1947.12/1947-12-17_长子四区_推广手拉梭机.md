    Changzi Fourth District
    Promotes Hand-Pulled Shuttle Looms
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 15th dispatch] Under the active promotion of Wang Gui, a cooperative hero, in the textile movement in Changzi Fourth District, 300 of the 4,000 women weavers in the district have learned to use the hand-pulled shuttle loom, and 150 looms have now been developed. In order to solve the difficulties of spinning and weaving, 11 cotton carding machines have also been developed, in addition to two cotton gins. In order to ensure the completion of the task of ten catties of cotton per woman this year, the District Production Committee has formulated promotion methods: 1. Send technicians to the countryside to guide women in learning spinning and weaving techniques; 2. Organize sixteen carpentry teams to manufacture shuttle looms for women weavers, which can manufacture eighty looms per month, and appropriately allocate carpenters to manufacture shuttle looms according to the specific conditions of each village; 3. Plan to hold a cloth thread exhibition in January next year to promote shuttle looms.
