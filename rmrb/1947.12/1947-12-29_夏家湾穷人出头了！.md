　　The Poor People of Xiajiawan Have Emerged!
    Jie Qing
    The residence of the notorious warlord and former Kuomintang Hubei Province Chairman, Xia Douyin, is in Xiajiawan, Dongmu Township, Macheng County. As the reporter approached Xiajiawan, he could see Xia Douyin's tall mansion from afar, standing alone on a sunny hillside. The brick and stone walls were three zhang high, and on either side of the black lacquered gate were written "Military Orders are like Mountains" and "Party Discipline is like Steel," with an incomplete portrait of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek in the center. This orderly Western-style building with over a hundred rooms resembled a large hotel in the city. "Why does only Xia Douyin's family live in Xiajiawan?" I asked the chairman of the Farmers' Association. He pulled me behind that magnificent opera house. It turned out that there were piles of dilapidated houses in a shady depression, and the chairman of the Farmers' Association said, "All those houses together are still not as many as Xia's family. In the past, besides paying rent and interest, the farmers couldn't even set foot on the mountain belonging to Xia Douyin. Now it's different. The poor people in tattered clothes and straw sandals come and go from Xia Douyin's mansion all day long. The Farmers' Association of the thirty 'wans' of Xiajiawan is housed there, and two hundred activists from the Farmers' Association were trained here a few days ago. In early October, when the work team arrived in Xiajiawan, Xia Douyin's wife had just fled, and his lackey rent collector, 'Master Xia,' was detained. The work team was worried that the people of Xiajiawan would not dare to distribute Xia Douyin's ill-gotten wealth, but the poor farmers not only distributed the clothing, but even moved away Xia's heavy furniture and pots and pans. The farmers also proposed to immediately move the Farmers' Association to Xia Douyin's mansion to work. There was a poor farmer surnamed Xia in Xiajiawan who distributed Xia Douyin's rice and put on Xia Douyin's clothes. I asked him if he was afraid. He said, "If I don't eat his grain and wear his clothes, I'm doomed. Now the world has changed for the better, and the People's Liberation Army has come. The poor people of our Xiajiawan can finally emerge. We are Xiajiawan, and no one is allowed to call it 'Xia Big Belly Wan' anymore." (Local farmers said this because Xia Douyin was fat, had a big belly, and was rich).

　　夏家湾穷人出头了！
    解清
    著名军阀前蒋记湖北省主席夏斗寅，住家在麻城县东木乡的夏家湾。记者到夏家湾，老远就看见夏斗寅的高大宅子，独立在向阳的山坡上，砖石围墙有三丈高，黑漆大门的两旁写着“军令如山”，“党纪似钢，”正中画着残缺不全的蒋贼肖像。这座一百多间整齐的洋楼，极象都市的大旅馆，“夏家湾怎么只住了夏斗寅一家呢？”我问农会主席，他把我拉到那座华丽的戏楼后面，原来山阴凹处还有一堆破旧的房屋，农会主席说：“那里全部房屋还没有夏家一家多；过去农民们除了交租息，连夏斗寅这帽山都不上。现在不同了，夏斗寅的洋楼里，成天来往的是穿烂衣、草鞋的穷苦人，住着夏家湾三十个湾子的农会，几天前还在这里集训过二百个农会积极分子。十月上旬，工作队来到夏家湾时，夏斗寅的老婆刚刚逃走，他的狗腿子收租人“夏大爷”被扣起来了。工作队很耽心夏家湾的老百姓不敢分夏斗寅的浮财，可是穷苦的农民们，不但分了衣物，连夏家笨重的家具以及盆罐之类，都搬走了。农民们并提议立即把农会搬到夏斗寅的洋楼来办公。夏家湾有个姓夏的贫苦农民他分了夏斗寅的稻谷，穿上夏斗寅的衣裳，我问他怕不怕？他说：“我不吃他的谷，不穿他的衣裳，我才死定啦，现在世道变好了，人民解放军来了，我们夏家湾的穷人可出头了。我们是夏家湾，以后谁也不准再说是夏大肚湾。”（当地农民因夏斗寅人胖肚子大，又有钱，故有此说）。
