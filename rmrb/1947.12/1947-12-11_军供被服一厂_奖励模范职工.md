    Military Supply Garment Factory No. 1
    Rewards Model Workers
    [This newspaper dispatch] The No. 1 Garment Factory of the Military Region Supply Department held a cotton clothing summary meeting on November 24. The production increase campaign, launched under the slogan of supporting the counter-offensive, completed ×0,000 sets of cotton clothing after 100 days of effort. During this intense campaign, all factory workers did their best, brought their strengths into play, and improved production efficiency and quality. Shi Yincheng, from Group 3, increased his daily output of cotton clothing lining from 65 pieces to 90 pieces; Lian Jinfu, from Group 4, specialized in making cotton clothing tops, increasing his daily output from 40 pieces to 50 pieces; Zhao Jiangzhu's group produced 9,529 sets during the 100-day crash program, with an average daily output of 14.5 sets per machine (strong); the cotton army uniforms made by Wang Genrong's group were neat, clean, uniform in color, and had even stitches, with 14 to 15 stitches per inch, earning them first place in the factory in terms of quality. Shi Guangrong, from the cutting group, carefully studied the layout, and the garment pieces he cut during the entire cotton clothing task met the requirements without any problems. Female worker Peng Yuemei locked 1,300 buttonholes in September, setting a new record for buttonhole locking. Storekeeper Gou Jinde cherished public property as if it were his own, inspecting the warehouse even in the rain. The work of two storekeepers was shouldered by him alone. Receiving and issuing cotton clothing and cotton, dismantling and washing old cotton clothing, and packing, were all done by Comrade Gou. He went wherever he was needed, and worked tirelessly, even becoming ill from overwork, but he did not rest. At the summary meeting, 49 comrades who worked actively, including Gou Jinde, Sun Xinglong, Cui Yinshuo, and Zhao Jiangzhu, received material rewards. In this competition, Zhao Jiangzhu and Zhou Jingzhong-led Group 2, won first place in the overall evaluation of quantity, quality, and conservation. They were also awarded a "Victory Banner." The factory is now repairing machines, preparing for the arrival of the single-layer clothing task, and will conduct another major competition. (Ge Qin)
