　　On Loyalty and Honesty
  　Pravda Editorial

　　Loyalty and honesty are the unwavering characteristics of Lenin and Stalin-type workers. Comrade Stalin teaches our Party and Soviet cadres to be as loyal and honest as Lenin. Bolsheviks should cultivate and develop these excellent qualities in every action of their work and life.

　　To be loyal means: "To confess all the truth to the Party frankly and honestly, as Ilyich often did, as every Bolshevik should do." (Stalin)

　　The loyalty and honesty that the Party requires of every Bolshevik are tested in practical work. A Communist Party member, regardless of his position, should have the courage to critically evaluate his activities and tell the truth about his activities. Political fidelity must be tested by "consistency between words and deeds" (Lenin). From this arises the most important Bolshevik principle—judging people not by their words, promises, or reports, but by their actions.

　　A Bolshevik's word is a fixed word. Leaders and public servants cannot speak casually. Once a word is spoken, it must show determination, perseverance, and fulfillment of one's promises. If you miscalculate for some reason, and your strength is not enough, then honestly say so, otherwise you are speaking in the disgraceful role of a chatterer or a liar.

　　Lenin said that when a person "is inconsistent in word and deed, it is completely bad, and it leads to hypocrisy."

　　Naturally, when it comes to educating cadres in a spirit of loyalty, it refers not only to faithfulness in the ordinary sense of the word, but also to being able to proceed in every (even the smallest) matter from the interests of the entire country, from the interests of the Party, and not from local or especially purely personal interests.

　　The Bolshevik Party—the vanguard of the Soviet people, the leader of the great creative labor of the Soviet people—educates all laborers, and especially those cadres in responsible leadership positions, in the spirit of a deep awareness of the interests of the country and the entire people. The experience and practice of socialist construction prove how deeply our cadres understand the interests of the entire country, and how irreconcilable they are with all phenomena that run counter to national interests. This can be seen in the examples of thousands of patriotic events being completed by the Soviet masses.

　　At the same time, there are instances where some workers put the interests of the country behind them. In order to obtain rewards or conceal shortcomings, such workers embellish the truth and embark on the evil path of deceiving the state, fraud, and fabrication, deliberately presenting false reports on the implementation of state plans.

　　The leaders of a construction bureau, headed by Ivanov, submitted false reports on the construction situation for many years. According to these reports, one hundred and thirty projects were "excellently" and "well" constructed. In fact, sixty-five of them were incomplete and unsuitable for operation. For these exaggerated figures, the construction bureau received two million rubles in bonuses over two years, of which Ivanov personally received one hundred and three thousand rubles. The leaders of the Omsk Oblast Party Committee and the Central Construction Bureau did not immediately notice these frauds and fabrications, but exposed them only after a long time.

　　Although similar situations are few in number, Party organizations cannot ignore them. The interests of the cause and the education of cadres require Party organizations not to ignore any illegal matter, but to counter them with the responsibility of educating workers with a loyal and honest attitude towards national interests.

　　It is needless to prove that shortcomings that are revealed in a timely manner are easier to eliminate. When people do not tell the truth in a timely manner, hide shortcomings, and finally expose failures in their work, it becomes very difficult to correct the situation. Therefore, workers should have the courage to tell the truth, not embellish reality, point out the actual situation, reveal shortcomings in a timely manner, and point out their roots. Party and Soviet workers should not place local interests above all else, but should truthfully reflect the situation of enterprises and collective farms in their districts. It is the duty of each of our workers not to put a distorted personal prestige above everything else.

　　Dishonesty to the state is often manifested in an unwillingness to shoulder demanding but fully achievable plans, in attempting to evade the implementation of plans by various excuses, and in trying to obtain supplementary national materials that are actually unnecessary. A true Bolshevik leader, without external urging or complaining, strives to exceed the tasks assigned by the state, seeks new reserves, and melts them into the overall national furnace, wholeheartedly serving the interests of the country and the people.

　　The most detailed plans and correct instructions from superiors cannot anticipate all the possibilities in a locality. If new reserves are discovered in the course of work, Bolsheviks cannot and should not hide them. From whom would he hide them? From his own government? From his own Party? Hiding reserves can only be the business of those who see the bell tower of their own yamen higher than the interests of the country and the Party.

　　Those who allow themselves to be cunning towards the state are easily succumbed to backward tendencies. They are always ready to exaggerate the difficulties in our path, and often do not show the courage and determination to take responsibility and pass their responsibility onto others—this is one of the manifestations of a dishonest attitude towards fulfilling national obligations. Cowards who are afraid to take responsibility and act according to the principle of "lest something go wrong" are incapable of moving things forward, improving them, and showing creativity and initiative.

　　To educate cadres in a spirit of loyalty and honesty means to educate them with their own mistakes and shortcomings. This is one of Stalin's maxims for the education of Bolshevik cadres.

　　Stalin taught:

　　"The duty of Bolsheviks is: not to cover up their mistakes, not to evade questions about their mistakes (as often happens among us), but to honestly and openly admit their mistakes, to honestly and openly seek ways to correct these mistakes, and to honestly and openly correct their mistakes."

　　There are instances where some workers evade admitting their mistakes, thinking that admitting mistakes harms the reputation of the worker and damages his prestige. This is an incorrect and false understanding of prestige. In fact, admitting one's mistakes and being prepared to correct them will not damage the worker's prestige, but will enhance it. It must be remembered Lenin's golden words: smart are not those who make no mistakes, but those who have made a mistake not very serious, and who know how to quickly and swiftly correct the mistake.

　　Felix Dzerzhinsky said:

　　"Only those who hide their shortcomings, are unwilling to fight against ugliness, that is, those who should lose their reputation will lose their reputation. Must learn to face the truth and seize the truth from the masses and all those who participate in production. There is nothing worse than boasting and complacency. Only when you search for ugliness step by step and conquer it can you move forward."

　　Criticism and self-criticism is the most important method of educating cadres in the spirit of loyalty and honesty. It is impossible to lead using the common saying "Don't wash your dirty linen in public."

　　Where the principle of the Party's selection of cadres is violated, it is easiest to happen similar non-Bolshevik habits. Whoever accepts the wrong method of selecting cadres creates favorable conditions for those leading groups to replace responsible workers with intimate small sectarian cliques or gangs (whose members try to live in peace and do not criticize each other). On this soil, vulgar inferiority breeds, and sometimes dishonesty towards national interests arises.

　　Criticism and self-criticism can make shortcomings exposed in a timely manner. If errors are not corrected at any time, new errors will breed, and finally destroy the worker. The following is an example that can be used as a lesson:

　　Comrade Andreev served as the first deputy chairman of the Saratov City Soviet Executive Committee for the last four years. At the beginning of his work, he made a series of serious mistakes. The Party's Municipal Committee and the State Committee received many complaints about the actions of Comrade Andreev, but they did not point out his mistakes to him in a timely manner. He was arrogant and boasted that he had no mistakes. Andreev abused his power, disregarded the authority of other members of the Soviet, arbitrarily revoked the decisions of the District Soviet, and isolated himself from the masses. At a State Committee meeting he declared: "I have many more serious things than receiving workers, I do not have time to listen to complaints."

　　Although all this could have been avoided for Andreev, he was eventually dismissed. If people had pointed out Comrade Andreev's mistakes in a timely manner, instead of covering up these mistakes due to friendship, he might have been retained as a worker.

　　It is wrong to pity "the self-esteem of cadres," thinking that it is doing them good. There is no more wrong view than this! To pity and preserve cadres by covering up their mistakes is tantamount to destroying these cadres in reality. Courageous, thorough, and objective criticism—this is the basic method of educating cadres. This criticism will help to complete cadres, stimulate progress, and overcome difficulties.

　　Kirov said:

　　"Our Bolshevik practice has never been a smooth relationship. We will irritate people,... anyone among us who thinks with this or that consideration, let it be, it's not good to say, I'd better not say it, don't criticize; then who will become a sinner. Should honestly, according to the Bolshevik method, look straight into the eyes of comrades, Communists, and say to him: 'You, dear person, you have been tripped, entangled. If you can't get up yourself, I'll help you. If pulling your hand can't pull you up, I'll pull your hair. I will do everything possible to correct you. But if you, dear person, do not correct yourself, then you blame yourself, you have to get out of the way.'"

　　To educate workers in a spirit of loyalty, without daily strict supervision, without the inspection of execution, is impossible. The relationship between Party organizations and workers cannot be built on blind trust. The most important task of Party leadership and supervision is to recognize shortcomings in the work and quickly propose methods to correct it. Without the perfect and skillfully organized inspection of execution, it is impossible to guarantee the timely revealing of shortcomings, and to educate workers with a spirit of loyalty and honesty, with a Bolshevik sense of responsibility for their assigned tasks. If the worker knows that the supervision is real, and that no one can muddle through the destruction of instructions without being known, then this alone is enough to make him nervous.

　　In order to successfully complete the tasks of the post-war Five-Year Plan, Party organizations should be more strict in their work, and should cultivate in workers that high sense of responsibility to the country and the people. For a Bolshevik, the interests of the country and the people are above all else. It is the sacred duty of Bolsheviks to carefully protect their own honor and virtue at all times and places, because it is the honor and virtue of the great party of Lenin and Stalin. In the eyes of all Soviet people, a party member should be an advanced person in everything, a person whose virtues cause universal admiration and imitation.

### 论忠诚与老实　真理报专论

　　论忠诚与老实
  　真理报专论
    忠诚、老实——这是列宁、斯大林型的工作人员之确定不移的特点。斯大林同志教导我们党的与苏维埃的干部，要像列宁那样忠诚与老实。布尔什维克在其工作与生活中的每一举措，均需培植与发展这种优良的品质。
    要忠诚——这就是说：“要像伊里奇经常作的那样，像每一个布尔什维克都应该作的那样，将全部真情率直而老实地向党坦白出来。”（斯大林）
    党对每个布尔什维克所要求的忠诚与老实，是在实际工作中来检验的。一个共产党员，不论其所处何种职位，他都应该有勇气批判地估价自己的活动，说出自己活动的真情。在政治上的忠实，完全要由“言行一致”（列宁）来检验。由此就产生了一个最重要的布尔什维克的原则——不是按照人们的言词、诺言、报告来评判人，而是按照人们的行为来评判人。
    布尔什维克的话——是固定不移的话。领导者、公务人员是不能随便说话的。话既说出，那就要表现决心、毅力，并执行自己的诺言。如果你因为什么原故盘算错了，力不能胜，——那你就老老实实说出这一点，否则你就是以哓舌者或骗子的可耻角色来说话。
    列宁说，当一个人“言行不一致时，这就完全糟了，这会导向伪善。”
    自然，当说到以忠诚的精神来教育干部的时候，这就不仅是指这个字在普通意义上的忠实，而且也是指善于在每一件（即令是最小的）事情上，从整个国家的利益，从党的利益出发，而不是从地方的尤其不是从纯粹私人的利益出发。
    布尔什维克党——苏维埃人民的先锋队，苏维埃人民伟大创造性的劳动之领导者——是以国家的、全民的利益之深刻意识的精神来教育全体劳动者的，这尤其指的是负责领导的干部。社会主义建设的经验与实际证明，我们的干部是如何深刻地了解整个国家的利益，他们如何不可调和地对待各种反国家利益的现象。这在苏维埃群众完成着的成千爱国事件的例子上就可以看出。
    同时，也有这样的情形：有时某些工作人员将国家的利益置于脑后。为了取得奖赏或隐瞒缺点，这样的工作人员就粉饰真情实况，走上了哄骗国家、欺诈和捏造的邪路，而故意地提出不合实情的关于执行国家计划的报告。
    由伊凡诺夫负责的某建设局的领导者们，在好几年中提出的关于建设情形的报告都是假的。按照这些报告，有一百三十件计划是“卓越地”和“很好地”建设好了。其实，其中六十五件是不完全的和不适于经营的。为了这些夸张的数字，建设局在两年过程中得到了两百万卢布的奖金，其中伊凡诺夫个人就得了十万零三千卢布。奥木斯克州党委会和中央建设局的领导者们，没有即时注意这些欺诈和捏造，而是很久以后才把它揭发出来。
    虽然类似的情况为数不多，党的组织仍不能无视这些情况。事业的利益和干部的教育，要求党的组织不能无视任何一件非法的事，而是有责任给他们以反击，以忠诚的老实的对待国家利益的态度，来教育工作人员。
    无须证明，及时揭露的缺点，是较易消除的。当人们不及时地讲出真情，隐藏缺点，而最后使工作中的失败暴露出来的时候，——那时要纠正形势就非常困难了。由此可见，工作人员是应该有勇气讲出真情，不粉饰现实，指出事情的实际状况，及时地揭露缺点，并指出其根源。党的和苏维埃的工作人员不应该将地方的利益提得过高，而应该如实地反应本区的企业、集体农场的情况，我们每个工作人员的本份，不要将被曲解了的个人威信高于一切。
    对国家的不老实，常常表现在不愿意肩负紧张的但是完全可能完成的计划，表现在企图以各种借口逃避计划的执行，表现在极力想得到其实没有也可以的国家的补充资材。真正的布尔什维克的领导者，无须外界之督促，也无须诉苦，就尽力超过完成国家所予的任务，去寻求新的储藏，俾促其熔于总的国家洪炉，一心为国家的、人民的利益服务。
    来自上级的最详细的计划及正确的指示，是不能够预先估计到当地所有的全部可能性的。如果在工作的过程中发现了新的储藏，布尔什维克不能也不应该将它们隐藏起来。他对谁隐藏它们呢？对自己的政府吗？对自己的党吗？隐藏后备只能是这样一些人的事，这些人将其衙门的钟楼看到高过国家的、党的利益。
    这些允许自己对国家要狡猾的人们，是容易屈服于落后的倾向的。他们对横在我们路上的困难，时刻准备加以夸大，又常常没有表现勇气与决心的魄力，希望不负责，把自己的责任推给别人——这是对完成国家义务的不老实态度的表现之一。害怕负责并按照“可不要出了什么岔子”的原则去作事的胆怯鬼，是没有能力将事情推向前进，改善它，并表现创造性与主动性的。
    以忠诚与老实的精神教育干部，这就是要以工作人员自己的错误与缺点来教育他们。这是斯大林对布尔什维克干部教育的箴言之一。
    斯大林教导说：
    “布尔什维克的责任就是：不掩盖自己的错误，不逃避有关自己错误的问题（像我们常常发生的那样），而是老实而公开地承认自己的错误，老实而公开地谋求纠正这些错误的方法，老实而公开地纠正自己的错误。”
    有这样的事实：某些工作人员逃避承认自己的错误，以为承认错误有伤工作人员的名誉，会有损其威信。这是对威信的不正确而虚伪的了解。实际上，承认自己的错误，准备纠正错误，是不会损伤工作人员的威信，反而会提高其威信的。必须记住列宁的金玉之言：聪明的不是那些不犯错误的人，而是那些犯了错误而不很严重，并善于敏捷而迅速地纠正错误的人。
    费力克斯·特捷仁斯基说：
    “会失去声望的只是那种隐蔽自己的缺点，不愿意同丑恶斗争的人，也就是那种本应失去声望的人。必须学会正视真理，并从群众及一切参加生产的人们那里去把握真理。再没有什么比自吹自擂与自满更坏的了。只有当你一步一步地搜索丑恶并征服它的时候，你才能够前进。”
    批评与自我批评，乃是在精神上教育干部忠诚与老实的最重要的方法。用平常的格言“家丑不可外扬”来进行领导，是不可能的。
    在党选择干部的原则遭受破坏的地方，是最容易发生这种类似的非布尔什维克的风习。谁接受了错误的选择干部的方法，谁就替那些领导集团造成有利条件，便于他们以亲密的小宗派、行帮（其成员尽力和平共居而不相互批评）来代替负责的工作人员。在这种土壤上，就繁殖着庸俗的劣根性，而有时就产生对国家利益的不诚实态度。
    批评与自我批评可以使缺点适时地揭发出来。错误如不随时予以纠正，即会滋生新的错误，并最后毁灭工作人员。下面就是一个可作教训的例子：
    安得列夫同志最近四年间在萨拉托夫城市苏维埃执委会担任第一副主席。还在他担任这一工作的开始，他就犯了一系列严重的错误。党的市委会与州委会接到了很多对安得列夫同志行为的控诉，但是他们并没有及时向他指出错误。他自高自大而且自诩为没有错误的。安得列夫滥用职权，蔑视苏维埃其他委员的权力，擅自取消区苏维埃的决定，并脱离群众。在一次州委员会的集会上他声明说：“我有很多比接见劳动者更严重的事情，我没有时间倾听控诉。”
    虽然这一切对于安得列夫都是可以避免的，他却终于被撤职了。如果人们及时地向安得列夫同志指出他的错误，而不是由于朋友的关系掩盖了这些错误，那么可能他还会作为一个工作人员而被保留。
    怜惜“干部的自尊心”，认为这对于他们就是做了有益的事，是不对的。没有比这种观点更错误的了！以掩盖干部的错误来怜惜和保存干部，等于实实在在地毁灭这些干部。勇敢的、彻底的和客观的批评——这是教育干部的基本方法。这种批评会帮助成全干部，刺激前进，克服困难。
    基洛夫说：
    “我们的布尔什维克的实践，从来没有过于平稳的关系。我们是会激怒人的，……我们中间谁要是以这种或那种考虑，认为算了吧，说了不好，我还是最好不说，不去批评；那谁就要成为罪人。应该老老实实地，按照布尔什维克的方法，直视同志的、共产党员的眼睛，向他说：‘你，亲爱的人，你被绊倒了，缠住了。如果你自己不能起来，我就来帮助你。如果拉着手也不能拉起你，我就来拉你的头发。我要尽一切可能，纠正你。但如果你，亲爱的人，不纠正过来，那么你就责骂你自己吧，你得滚到旁边去。’”
    以忠诚的精神教育工作人员，没有日常的严格的监督，没有执行的检查，是不可能的。党的组织同工作人员的关系，不能建立在盲目的信任上。党的领导和监督之最重要的任务，就是认出工作中的缺点，很快地提出方法纠正它。没有执行完善而熟练地加以组织的检查，就不可能保证适时地揭发缺点，并以忠诚与老实的精神，以布尔什维克对所负任务之责任心的精神教育工作人员。如果工作人员知道监督是实实在在的，谁也不能将破坏指示的事马虎混过，而不为人所知，——那么仅此即足以使他紧张起来。
    为了胜利地完成战后五年计划的任务，党的组织在工作上就更严格，就更要培养工作人员那种对国家对人民的崇高的责任感。对于一个布尔什维克，国家的、全民的利益是高于一切的。布尔什维克的天职，就是随时随地小心地保护自己的荣誉与美德，因为这是列宁斯大林的伟大政党的荣誉与美德。在全体苏维埃人民的眼中，一个党员应该在一切事情上是先进的人，其德性引起普遍的崇敬与做效之心的人。（斯列波夫作，齐生译自四七年六月二十三日真理报）
