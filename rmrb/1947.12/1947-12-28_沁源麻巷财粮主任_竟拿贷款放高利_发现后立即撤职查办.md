[Taiyue Telegraph, 26th of this month] A loan inspection in Qinshui District 1 revealed that some landlords and bad cadres were still using loans to exploit the masses. During the initial loan inspection in District 1, it was discovered that Zhang Renyi, the financial and grain director of Maxiang Village, was privately using bank loans for usurious exploitation of the masses. In March of this year, the bank loaned 150,000 yuan to the masses of Maxiang Village at an interest rate of 1.3% per month (which has not yet been collected). However, in May, Zhang Renyi privately collected the money from the masses and then re-loaned it to them at a high interest rate of 15% per month. In August, under the pretext of going to the government for accounting purposes, he took the village public office seal and the village chief's name stamp to the bank and borrowed 50,000 yuan at an interest rate of 1.5% per month. After returning to the village, he again loaned the money to the masses at a high interest rate of 15% per month. In the past six months, Zhang Renyi has exploited over 30,000 yuan in interest from the loans. After the discovery, he was ordered to return all the exploited interest to the masses and was dismissed and investigated. In Yanzhai Village, 200,000 yuan was loaned in March to set up mutual aid teams. As a result, the mutual aid team members only used the money once for transportation before the village cooperative took it back for its own use, while the masses had to pay interest to the bank. The masses knew this was a bitter pill to swallow, but they dared not say a word. It was also recently discovered that among the loans made in Chengguan in March, 17,500 yuan was loaned to four struggle targets.

　　沁源麻巷财粮主任
  　竟拿贷款放高利
  　发现后立即撤职查办
    【本报太岳二十六日电】沁源一区检查贷款，发现仍有贷给地主和坏干部利用贷款剥削群众的事。一区在初次检查贷款中，即发现麻巷村财粮主任张仁一，私自利用银行贷款加以高利剥削群众。今年三月，银行贷给麻巷村群众十五万元款，利息一分三厘（至今未收），但在五月时，张仁一即私自向群众收回，随即又以一角五分高利贷给群众。八月间，又以到政府算帐为名，将村公所公章与村长名章拿上，前往银行贷款五万元，利息一分五厘。回村后，又以一角五分高利贷给群众，至今六个月中，张仁一已从贷款中剥削群众三万余元利息。经检查发现后，除令其将全部剥削息利归还群众外，并撤职查办。阎寨村三月份搞互助组，贷款二十万元，结果互助组群众只贷了一次搞运输，就被该村合作社全部收回使用，而让群众给银行出利息，群众明知是苦头，但不敢吭气。最近又发现城关三月贷款中，贷给了四家斗争对象一万七千五百元。
