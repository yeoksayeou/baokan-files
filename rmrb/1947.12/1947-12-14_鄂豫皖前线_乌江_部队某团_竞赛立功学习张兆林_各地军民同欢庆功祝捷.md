Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, December 12th: Correspondent Li Nanli reports: Following the victory at the Battle of Gaoshanpu, a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army's "Wujiang Unit" recently held a meeting of meritorious individuals at their station and decided to launch an emulation campaign, initiating the Zhang Zhaolin movement in all companies. Many meritorious individuals immediately expressed their desire to challenge Zhang Zhaolin, determined to catch up with him. Meritorious individual Ding Zijing said: "We must learn from Zhang Zhaolin's firm political stance." Cheng Baogen said: "We must learn from Zhang Zhaolin's mutual assistance and fraternity." A meritorious cook said: "We must learn from Zhang Zhaolin's spirit of not fearing sacrifice and completing tasks." Comrade Zhang Zhaolin, a native of Guangping, Hebei, has been working actively since joining the army in February this year. He trains day and night, achieving the best results and earning a special merit. During mutual assistance in marching, he often carried two or three guns. In his class, there were no dropouts or desertions, and he earned another special merit. He demonstrated exceptional bravery and decisiveness in the battles of Yuncheng, the 70th Division, and the siege of the 32nd Division. After a long march, disregarding fatigue, he chased after the fleeing enemy, believing that "whether or not he earned merit depends on whether he could catch up in these few steps." Encouraged by him, the soldiers persevered and charged forward, capturing a great deal, earning him another special merit. During the Battle of Gaoshanpu, he called for steadfastly holding positions, repelling three enemy counterattacks. For the fourth time, he was awarded a special merit and promoted to deputy platoon leader. Before joining the army, he was an activist in his village, fighting against landlords and despots for several years. When he joined the army, he took the lead in calling on many young people to join the troops, demonstrating his high level of class consciousness and his boundless loyalty to the cause of people's liberation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, December 12th: Late news: After the great victory at Gaoshanpu, the People's Liberation Army recently held victory celebration rallies in various places. Newly liberated peasants from various places participated in teams, with gongs and drums shaking the sky, and the military and civilians rejoicing and singing. The masses hung colorful flags, posted slogans, and made congratulatory gifts, banners, and pennants to send to the stationed troops, paying tribute to the people's heroes. When a certain unit held a grand meeting in Tangjiadian, Xishui, the masses from nearby villages presented red and green banners with the words "Support the People's Liberation Army" and set off firecrackers to celebrate. When a certain unit held a brigade-wide celebration rally in a certain place in early spring, as many as two thousand people participated. Rural drama troupes and military Yangko teams, Taiping carts, and dragon boats performed to the sound of Xiao, Hu, and ancient music, and the military and civilians enjoyed themselves together.
