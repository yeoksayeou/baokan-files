　　【Report from Jinan, Hebei, 1st】Old widow Chai Zhang of Fengcun, Fourth District, Zaoqiang County, is 72 years old and lives alone. She only farms two mu of alkaline sandy land. This autumn, she only harvested three dou of grain and thirty jin of cotton. These things are only enough to eat for three months, and she will have to go hungry in the winter. She found three women who gather under one lamp to spin yarn at night, spinning until midnight every day, and getting up again as soon as the rooster crows. Each person spins one jin of yarn every day, earning 30,000 yuan per month, enough to buy 230 jin of millet. Chai Zhang not only solved the food problem, but also raised a piglet and four chickens. In addition, they can save 2,400 yuan on lamp oil each month. Other women have not only improved their lives, but also gained the support of their families. Now they have moved from individual production to mutual assistance. Li Baolin's family in Houhuaifu, Third District, Wuyi County, has seven people and farms twenty-five mu of land, harvesting more than 1,200 jin of grain. Under the government's call to increase production and practice thrift to overcome the famine, he made an accurate calculation. Based on each person eating one and a half jin of grain per day, the grain they harvested this year will only last until the Lunar New Year. After calculating, his mother-in-law and wife both said: "This is terrible! If we don't find a way, we will definitely go hungry next year. Let's step up spinning and weaving!" So the mother-in-law and wife spun and weaved during the day and did needlework at night. Three days of spinning one jin of cotton can earn 1,000 yuan. The daughter-in-law weaves one cloth a day, earning 2,000 yuan. In more than a month, they earned a total of 73,000 yuan.

　　冯村妇女纺织渡荒
    【本报冀南一日电】枣强四区冯村老寡妇柴张氏，年已七十二岁，只她一人过日子，仅种二亩碱沙地，今年秋季只收了三斗谷子，三十斤棉花。这些东西只够吃三个月，到冬天就得挨饿。她找了三个妇女，晚上凑在一个灯下纺线，每天纺到半夜，鸡一叫就又起来纺。每天一人纺一斤线，每月每人可赚洋三万元，能买小米二百卅斤。柴张氏不但解决了粮食问题，又喂了一个小猪，四只鸡，另外她们每月可省灯油二千四百元。其他妇女不但在生活上得到改善，还受到家庭的拥护。现在她们已由个人生产走向互助了。武邑三区后怀甫李保林家，有七口人，种地二十五亩，收粮食一千二百余斤。在政府号召生产节约渡灾荒下，他作了精确的算帐。按每人每天吃斤半粮食，今年收入的粮食只吃到旧历年关。计算后婆媳都说：“可了不的！要不想办法，明年一定要挨饿。加紧纺花织布吧。”于是婆媳二人白天纺织，夜晚做针线活。三天纺一斤花，可赚洋一千元。媳妇一天织一个布，可赚洋二千元。一个多月的工夫，共获利七万三千元。
