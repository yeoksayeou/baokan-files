    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Sofia dispatch: The Bulgarian National Assembly, with its 365 members, unanimously passed the "Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria" on the 4th. When the parliament held its third reading on the 4th, all members attended, and Prime Minister Dimitrov personally led government officials to attend as well. In addition, representatives from various political parties and mass organizations, as well as guests from all walks of life, were present. The atmosphere in the venue was extremely solemn and grand. When the results of the voting were announced amidst the sound of saluting cannons, thunderous applause erupted. Thousands of people waiting for good news around the venue were ecstatic. After the new constitution was passed, Speaker Kolarov delivered a speech stating: "This is a day of historical significance, as important as the victory day of September 9, 1944, and the overthrow of the monarchy on September 15, 1946, and should be recorded in history. The passage of the new constitution marks the end of the struggle to lay the foundation for Bulgaria's new democratic regime, and a new era of prosperity and development for our country has begun. This new constitution is one of the most democratic and progressive constitutions in the world. The new constitution proves that the Bulgarian people have reached a high level of political and spiritual maturity; and proves that our country will occupy a prominent position among other Slavic countries in the great family of democratic and progressive nations. The Slavic people are taking on a leading role on the road to socialism for all mankind. The new constitution also opens up unlimited prospects for the great development of industry, agriculture, and handicrafts. The constructive labor of the working people will rapidly make our country a strong industrial and agricultural nation. Class conflict will thus be缓和，and will eventually disappear, replaced by the harmony of the interests of the working people. The dirty Fascism is on the decline, and the bright future of the new world that our progressive people have been eagerly looking forward to has unfolded before us." Prime Minister Dimitrov then took the floor and delivered a speech stating: "The new constitution was written with the blood shed by our heroic people over the years in the struggle against the royalist fascists and the bourgeois dynasty. The main principle on which the new constitution is based is 'all power belongs to the people and serves the interests of the people.' Our country has no, and cannot have, any other power. The privileges of private capital have been permanently eliminated, and any possibility for the bourgeoisie to exercise rule has been completely eradicated. The administrative leadership of the People's Republic belongs to the working people, in other words, to the workers, peasants, handicraft workers, and freelancers, that is, to the physical and mental laborers, both men, women, and young people, who do work that benefits society. The new constitution has established the principle of people's democracy and paved the way for the further social development of our people, which will completely eliminate the remnants of capitalism and thoroughly eradicate the system of exploitation of man by man. Our people must clearly realize that the implementation of the new constitution is guaranteed by the close unity of the people under the leadership of the Fatherland Front, and by vigilance and relentless struggle against the enemy." The news of the passage of the new constitution has spread throughout the country, and people everywhere have held grand celebrations and pledged to do everything in their power to promote its implementation. A resolution passed by the Sofia Citizens' Congress stated: "After the passage of the constitution, Bulgaria will firmly stand at the forefront of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp under the leadership of the Soviet Union." The National Assembly has also decided to print one million copies of the full text of the constitution and distribute them to the people free of charge. (Note: The total population of Bulgaria is approximately six million).

    【新华社陕北十日电】索菲亚讯：保加利亚国民议会三百六十五名议员，已于四日最后一致通过“保加利亚人民共和国宪法”。当四日国会举行三读时，全体议员都出席，保总理季米特洛夫也亲率政府要员列席，此外并有各政党及群众团体等代表与各界来宾等。会场空气极其庄严隆重。在礼炮高鸣声中宣布开票结果时，四座掌声雷动。群众会场四周等候好消息的几千群众狂欢兴奋到了顶点。议长科拉罗夫于通过新宪法后发表演说称：“这是具有历史意义的一天，与一九四四年九月九日胜利日及一九四六年九月十五日推翻君主日同样重要，而应大书特书。新宪法的通过，为保加利亚新民主政权奠定基础的斗争业已结束，而我国繁荣发展的新纪元业已开始。这一新宪法是世界最民主最进步的宪法之一。新宪法证明保加利亚人民已达到政治上与精神上成熟的高度水平；并证明我国将与其他斯拉夫国家，同在民主与进步国家之大家庭中，占有显著的地位。斯拉夫人民，在全人类迈向社会主义的大道上，负起领导作用。新宪法并为工农业与手工业的巨大发展，开辟无限前途。劳动人民的建设性劳动，将使我国迅速成为强大的工农业国家。阶级冲突将因此缓和，且终必消灭，而由劳动人民利益的和谐一致取而代之。肮脏的法西斯主义已行没落，我国进步人民热望着的新世界光明远景，已在前面展开。”季米特洛夫总理继起发表演说称：“新宪法是用我国英勇人民许多年来在反对保皇党法西斯分子及资产阶级王朝斗争中所洒的鲜血所写成。新宪法根据的主要原则，就是‘一切权力归于人民，并为人民的利益服务’。我国没有也不能有任何其他权力。私人资本的特权，已被永远消灭，资产阶级实行统治的任何可能性，已被完全根绝。人民共和国在行政上领导权属于劳动人民，换言之即属于工人、农民、手工业工人及自由职业者，也就是属于做造福社会的工作的男子、妇女及青年等体力及智力劳动者。新宪法已确定人民民主的原则，且为我国人民进一步社会发展铺平道路，将使资本主义残余完全消灭，使人剥削人的制度彻底根除。我国人民必须清晰认识，新宪法的实行，是以祖国阵线领导下人民的紧密团结，及对敌人的警觉与无情斗争，作为其保障。”新宪法通过之消息，已遍传全国，各地人民均举行盛大庆祝，并保证以全力促其实现。索菲亚公民大会通过决议称：“宪法通过以后，保加利亚将坚决站在苏联领导下之民主反帝国主义阵营之前列。”又国民大会已决议印行宪法全文一百万份，免费分发国人。（按保全国人口约共六百万人）。
