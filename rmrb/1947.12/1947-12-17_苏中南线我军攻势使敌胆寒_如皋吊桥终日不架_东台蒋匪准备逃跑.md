Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th. After the Li (bao) - (cha) Line Campaign and the widespread attacks by local armed forces, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in various towns in Central Jiangsu are in a state of chaos, feeling that their doomsday is approaching. On December 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Huangqiao frantically opened fire towards the outskirts after a rumor that "the New Fourth Army is coming." Due to a misfire, more than 50 bandit officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. In Rugao, starting from the 2nd, the city gates only opened at 10:00 AM and closed at 3:00 PM. The drawbridge at the north gate remained unraised all day, and villagers in the suburbs were forbidden from entering the city. Electric fences were set up under the city walls. In Haian, in addition to emergency alerts, people were forced to demolish civilian houses outside the embankments. In Taizhou, which has been under the long-term rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the Tai (zhou) - Dong (tai) ferry service was also suspended. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Dongtai are preparing to flee. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Sanyu, Datong, Beixinqiao and other places have all fled to Nantong city. The families of the bandit chiefs in the suburbs of Taixing are moving into the city one after another. The families of the bandit leaders in the city are fleeing to Shanghai. The local tyrant strongholds on the Ru (gao) - Huang (qiao) line are keeping their fences tightly closed all day long, not daring to go out, and some have already fled to Rugao city. When Wang Hehui, the bandit chief of Dayangzhuang on the Hai (an) - Tai (zhou) line, was attacked by our guerrillas, his hands trembled, and his burst rifle fell to the ground as he fled. Gu Changsheng, the bandit township chief on the same line, was taking a bath in a bathhouse one day when he suddenly heard gunfire several miles away, and he hurriedly ran away with his pants half on. Currently, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and local tyrants in various places are panicking about "the New Fourth Army is coming soon."

    苏中南线我军攻势使敌胆寒
    如皋吊桥终日不架
    东台蒋匪准备逃跑
    【新华社华东十四日电】李（堡）＠（茶）线战役及各地地武广泛出击后，局处苏中各城镇蒋匪已手忙脚乱，感到末日将至。本月二日，黄桥蒋匪在“新四军来了”的谣传下，慌忙向四郊开炮，因炮弹走火，炸死炸伤匪官兵五十余名。如皋二日起，上午十时方开城门，下午三时即行关闭，北门吊桥终日不架，并禁止城郊乡民上街，城墙下设置电网。海安除紧急戒备外，并迫令拆毁圩外民房。蒋匪长期统治之泰州，亦将泰（州）东（台）班轮停驶。东台蒋匪正作逃跑准备。三余、大同、北新桥等地蒋匪均逃往南通城内。泰兴城郊匪乡、保、甲长纷纷向城内搬家。城内匪首家属，则纷纷逃往上海。如（皋）黄（桥）线土顽据点，终日紧闭篱笆，不敢外出，有的已逃往如皋城。海（安）泰（州）线上之大阳庄匪保长王鹤会遭我游击队袭击时，双手颤抖，快慢机坠地而逃。该线匪乡长顾长生一天在澡塘洗澡，忽听到数里外有枪声，忙拉着裤子狼狈逃窜。现各地蒋匪土顽正为“新四军快要来了”而惊惶不安。
