[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatches of the 2nd and 3rd] Reports from various sources: The Italian working people continue to resolutely repulse the provocations of reactionaries and fascists. On November 28th, ten thousand working people in Milan, led by three thousand former guerrillas, held a grand parade in front of the Milan County Government to oppose the government's removal of the county chief, former guerrilla Chulio. Five thousand demonstrators occupied the county government, telegraph office, radio station, stock exchange, and other institutions in the city, with orderly conduct. Citizens brought them food, and the demonstrators blocked the streets near the county residence with trucks. Milan labor groups announced a one-day general strike to show their support. At the same time, Milan Mayor Grippi of the Socialist Party announced his resignation, expressing solidarity with the people. One hundred and twenty-six other mayors in Milan also resigned in protest against the government's reactionary behavior. In this movement, the police, moved by the people's justice, turned their weapons around and became guardians of the people, guarding the county government and occupying several buildings along with the guerrillas and the people of the city. The government had ordered the Milan Garrison Commander to have full power in the city, but after the commander met with County Chief Chulio, he refused to take on police duties, and the troops remained in the barracks, standing idly by. Representatives of the Italian Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and all democratic groups (even the Saragat faction) formed a central committee for the movement, maintained public order in Milan, and sent a delegation to the Ministry of Interior to retain Chulio and request that democratic groups be consulted when appointing a new county chief. At the same time, left-wing newspapers in Rome, Milan, Turin, Genoa, and other places announced that unless the insult imposed on Milan (i.e., the removal of the county chief) was removed, workers across the country would carry out a general strike. Due to the repeated demonstration of great strength by the Italian people, the reactionary government was forced to agree to Chulio's temporary retention of his post, and the Milan general strike was thus temporarily halted. According to Milan workers and democratic groups, whether the strike will continue depends on the government's response to the people of Milan. Member of Parliament Scolimaro criticized Minister of Interior Scelba's act of removing the county chief in parliament as "deliberate provocation." He emphasized that its failure to be implemented was only due to the opposition of the Italian people's strength outside of parliament; the people know how to express their will.

In other parts of Italy, demonstrations and strikes against reactionaries, fascists, and police brutality are on the rise. Workers in Altamura in the province of Apulia held demonstrations. Ten thousand miners in Sicily continued their strike in protest against the police opening fire on demonstrators on the 26th of last month. In Certo, near Mantua (northern Italy), the local Communist Party leadership was bombed, and the local people angrily smashed the houses of the landlords' association and the Christian Democratic Party. Towns in Mantua also immediately held anti-fascist protest demonstrations on the 28th of last month. At the end of last month, people's demonstrations were also held in Novara, Venice, Genoa, Udine, Modena and other places, and reactionary strongholds were destroyed. During the people's demonstrations, the reactionary authorities, frightened by the power of the people, kept the troops in the barracks to prevent them from standing with the people.

According to Agence France-Presse: On the 1st, twenty thousand guerrillas in Genoa marched in demonstration. Former leader of the resistance movement and executioner of Mussolini, Andisio, said in his speech that if the anti-fascist movement's laws are not passed by the Constituent Assembly, the Italian people have the sacred right to put them into practice. The Genoa demonstration quickly spread throughout the Liguria province (Genoa belongs to the province), and the entire province turned to a tide of demonstrations protesting against the government.

　　继续坚决回击反动派的挑衅
    米兰成万人民大示威
    前游击队员带头占领县政府反法西斯怒潮冲击全意各地
    【综合新华社二、三日电】各方讯：意大利劳动人民继续坚决回击反动派与法西斯的挑衅。十一月二十八日，米兰一万劳动人民以三千以前的游击队员带头，在米兰县府前举行盛大游行，反对政府撤换该县县长前游击队员初里约。五千示威者占领了县政府、电报局、无线电台、交易所及城内其他机关，秩序井然。市民为他们送饭，示威者以卡车封锁县邸附近街道。米兰劳工团体宣布总罢工一天以示声援。与此同时，米兰市长社会党人格里匹宣布辞职，表示与人民团结一致。米兰其它一百二十六个市镇长也同时辞职，抗议政府的反动行为。在这运动中警察为人民正义所感，反戈而为人民的守卫者，守卫着县政府，并与游击队及该市人民一道占领了若干大厦。政府曾下令米兰警备司令掌有该城充分权力，但该司令与初里约县长会谈后，拒绝担任警察职务，部队留在军营里，袖手不管。意共、社会党及一切民主团体的代表（甚至萨拉盖特派也在内）组成了该运动的中央委员会，维持了米兰公共秩序，并派代表团向内政部挽留初里约，并要求委任新县长时应与民主团体商议。同时，罗马、米兰、都灵、热那亚等地的左翼报纸宣布：除非扫除加诸米兰的污辱（即撤换县长），否则各地工人将实行总罢工。由于意大利人民一再表现了巨大的力量，反动政府被迫答允初里约暂时留任，米兰总罢工才因此暂告停止。据米兰工人与民主团体称，罢工之是否继续，需以政府对米兰人民的回答如何而定。议员斯科利马罗在议会中抨击内长谢尔巴撤换县长的行为“是故意挑衅”，他着重指出：它的所以没有实行，只是由于议会以外的意大利人民力量的反对，人民是知道怎样表示他们的意志的。
    在意大利其他地方，反对反动派、法西斯分子及警察暴行的示威及罢工不断高涨。阿蒲里亚省的阿塔穆拉的工人举行示威。西西里一万矿工为抗议上月二十六日警察向示威者开火，继续罢工。在曼都亚（意北）附近的赛勒托共产党地方领导机关为炸弹爆炸，该地人民愤怒的捣毁了大地主协会及平民党的房屋。曼都亚各城镇也于上月二十八日立即举行反法西斯抗议示威。上月底在诺瓦拉、威尼斯、热那亚、犹丁、摩登纳等地均举行了人民示威，并捣毁反动势力中心。在人民示威时，反动当局慑于人民的威力，将军队关在兵营内，以防止他们与人民站在一起。
    又据法新社讯：一日，热那亚有二万游击队员游行示威，前抵抗运动领袖，墨索里尼行刑人安迪秀演说称：如果反法西斯运动的法律不为立宪议会通过，意人民有神圣的权利使之付诸实行。热那亚的示威迅速遍及全里古利亚省（热那亚即属该省），全省都转入抗议政府的示威热潮中。
