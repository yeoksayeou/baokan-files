　　【Report from LiCheng】Liu Jianzhou, a liberated farmer from Cheyuan Village, Fifth District, has formulated a winter production plan to compensate for the poor harvest. He uses a carrying pole to collect and transport fertilizer, ensuring he doesn't have to touch the grain harvested in the autumn. On December 5th, he carried a carrying pole to Henan store to carry 40 pounds of cotton and 38 pounds of salt, and sell them in Tunliu, earning 8,100 yuan. On the way back, he picked up 15 pairs of cotton shoes in Changzhi and sold them at the Xijing market, earning 8,250 yuan. On the way back, he collected a load of fertilizer. The round trip took eight days. He always ate yellow steamed buns (cornmeal) when staying in hotels, without spending money recklessly. After deducting expenses of 4,500 yuan, he earned 11,850 yuan, which he used to buy one shi (market peck) of corn (mixed with chaff at a ratio of 4:6) to support his family for the winter. He continues to carry and sell goods as usual, earning enough grain to overcome the famine.
