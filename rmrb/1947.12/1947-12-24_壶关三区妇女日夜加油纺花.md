　　Women in Huguan Third District Work Day and Night to Spin Cotton Diligently
    [Report from our newspaper in Huguan] Four hundred and seventy poor women and hired laborers in the Third District of Huguan are studying in the district. After returning to their villages, they became the backbone and core force in promoting winter cotton spinning. Song Gen's wife from Changjiachi Village, who previously didn't know how to spin, learned to spin first-class thread within ten days after studying. She said: "We can't just talk about it at home, we have to learn skills. If we have skills, we won't rely on others." She promoted the night spinning movement in the entire village. Women cadres in Jinzhuang sub-district conduct inspections every night. For example, in Changjiachi, they found that Chang Suo's wife was spinning vigorously, so the loudspeaker announced: "The spinning in the street sub-district is good, especially Sister-in-law Chang Suo. She planned to spin half a kilogram in five days, but she spun it in less than three days." Women in Nanzhuang sub-district weigh the cotton at night, and don't sleep until they finish spinning. Under the slogans "Spin half a flower at night, ensure prosperity for the family" and "Spin good thread and weave good cloth, improve skills and make every family rich," the six sub-districts in the entire district conducted challenge competitions and inspected each other. Gu Village sub-district, led by spinning model Fan Baiyun, inspected the Shili sub-district, which greatly promoted the technology of the Shili sub-district. According to statistics from nineteen villages and one thousand three hundred spinning women in fifteen days, they spun three thousand eight hundred and ninety-five kilograms of cotton. In Jinzhuang sub-district, seven villages and four hundred and forty-three women spun three hundred and fifty-one kilograms of cotton in seven nights, earning 175,970 yuan. Currently, large and small cooperatives throughout the district are rushing to purchase raw materials to strive to complete the task of producing 15,000 kilograms of native cloth and 22,500 kilograms of cotton.

    【本报壶关讯】壶关三区四百七十个贫雇妇女在区上学习。回村后，成为推动冬纺的骨干和核心。常家池村松根妻，以前不会纺花，学习后十天内学会了纺头等线子，她说：当家哩不能空说，得学本事哩，有了本领就不靠别人啦，她推动了全村的夜纺运动。晋庄小区妇女干部，每天夜间进行检查，如常家池查出常所妻纺织起劲，广播筒就喊出：“街里小区纺织好，特别是那长所嫂，计划五天纺一斤，不够三天就纺了。”南庄小区的妇女夜间把花称出，不纺完就不睡，在“夜纺两半花，保证能发家”“纺好线织好布提高技术家家富”的口号下，全区六个小区进行了挑战比赛，互相检查。固村小区由纺英范柏云带领，到十里小区检查后，对十里小区的技术有很大推动。据十五天十九个村一千三百个纺妇统计，纺花三千八百九十五斤。晋庄小区七个村，四百四十三个妇女，七夜纺花三百五十一斤，可赚洋十七万五千九百七十元。现全区大小合作社，正在突击购买原料，为完成三万斤土布四万五千斤棉花而奋斗。
