    The People of the Liberated Northeast China
    Engage in Production with New Vigor after Emancipation
    ◇The Guangxing vessel, sunk in Suibin County by the Japanese invaders during their surrender, was salvaged by emancipated workers last November by breaking through the ice and entering the water. It has been repaired and successfully test-sailed on August 31st, officially named "Worker No. 1," with a load capacity of 1,800 tons. It is now officially operating on the Songhua River, connecting Jiamusi and Harbin.
    ◇The Jilin Industrial and Commercial Bureau allocated 100 million yuan in July and August to develop the textile industry. It has trained more than 600 technicians, established eight spinning factories, manufactured more than 12,000 spinning wheels, 3,000 hemp spinning wheels, and installed 80 iron and wooden weaving machines and nine electric spinning machines, producing 180 jin of yarn per day. In the Yanbian area alone, the number of households engaged in spinning has reached 20,000. In Xisuizi Village, Wangqing County, seven women voluntarily organized themselves to weave, earning more than 700,000 yuan in three to four months, buying three oxen and 76 bags of grain.
    ◇The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government has reorganized the "Eastern Mongolia Forestry Company" into the "Inner Mongolia Forestry and Mining General Bureau," with the former Director, Chor Batur, as the Director-General. The General Bureau is located in Wangyemiao and manages the vast forests and fields of Wuyigou and Arba areas, as well as the forests and mines of Abayan Banner and Molidawa Banner. In the past year, the company has harvested 16,000 cubic meters of timber.
    ◇Emancipated poor and hired farmers in the Gaha District of Acheng County have used the fruits of their struggle to buy more than 500 new horses and 150 flower-wheeled carts, achieving three horses pulling one cart.
