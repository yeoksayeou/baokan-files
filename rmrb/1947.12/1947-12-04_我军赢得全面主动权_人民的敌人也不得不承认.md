Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Even the enemies of the Chinese people now admit that the Chinese war situation has undergone a fundamental change, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army has won the overall advantage and initiative in the Chinese war. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 29th, quoting comments from so-called "observers," stated: "On all battlefields of the vast civil war, the Communists (referring to the People's Liberation Army) have seized the initiative against the 'Nationalist Army' (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits). The leadership of the war has apparently shifted from the hands of Chiang Kai-shek's strategists to the hands of the Communist generals. In the past few months, the Communist generals have been able to predict every campaign of the 'Nationalist Army' (Chiang bandits) and use timely containment to thwart the planned offensives of the 'Nationalist Army' (Chiang bandits)." It also stated: "People increasingly believe that General Liu Bocheng's southward advance is part of a long-term plan of the Communists." A United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th, quoting comments from so-called "qualified military observers," said: "Despite fighting for two years, the government's (referring to the Chiang bandits) position looks darker today than before. Since July, the government (Chiang) forces have been forced to adopt a defensive posture on all major battlefields. The Communists, based in the vast countryside that holds a huge supply of Chinese grain and manpower, are practically free to eliminate or besiege the 'Nationalist Army' (Chiang bandits) garrisons holding isolated cities or railways." On the Chiang Kai-shek side, they have "exhausted their offensive power and lost the initiative" on all major battlefields, and "the increasingly critical nature of the war has caused serious concern among (Chiang bandits) officials and the (Chiang) government, which is why they (referring to the Chiang bandits) are busy reorganizing the war command, organizing new armies, and redeploying old armies."

　　我军赢得全面主动权
  　人民的敌人也不得不承认
    【新华社陕北二日电】即使是中国人民的敌人，现在亦已承认中国战局已起根本变化，中国人民解放军，已赢得中国战争全局的优势与主动权。美联社南京二十九日电引所谓“观察家”的评论称：“在广阔内战的各个战场上，共军（指人民解放军）都已握有对‘国军’（指蒋匪）的主动权。战争的主导权，显然已由蒋介石战略家们的手中转移到共军将领们的手中了。在过去数月内，共军将领能预测‘国军’（蒋匪）每一次战役，而用及时的牵制使‘国军’（蒋匪）已计划的攻势失败”。又称：“人们日益相信，刘伯承将军部队的向南挺进是共军长期计划的一部分”。合众社南京三十日电引所谓“有资格的军事观察家”的评论说：“尽管打了两年仗，政府（指蒋匪）的地位，今天看起来比以前更黑暗了。自七月以来，政府（蒋）军就被迫在各主要战场上采取防御，共军以保有中国粮食与人力巨大供应的广大乡村为根据地，实际上已能自由消灭或围困坚守于孤立城市或铁路上的‘国军’（蒋匪）守军”。而蒋介石方面则在各主要战场上“耗尽了进攻力量丧失了主动权”，“战争之转趋危急，已引起（蒋匪）官方人士及（蒋）政府的严重忧虑，这就是他们（指蒋匪）正在忙于改组作战指挥部，组织新的军队，重新布署旧的军队的原因”。
