(Reported from the Jilu Yu Border Region Headquarters on the 7th) The masses in Shangyan Town and Village in the tenth district of Changyuan, after "thinking about the past and comparing it with the present," achieved four wishes for joining the army (personal willingness, father's willingness, mother's willingness, and wife's willingness), and only registered with the consent of the whole family. Since the village cadres and activists returned from the county meeting, they held various mobilization meetings and then began brewing ideas in each household, using the method of thinking about the past and comparing it with the present to inspire each other. Village instructor Shang Wenzhi registered to join the army at the county's village cadre activist meeting, determined to join the army. After returning home, he gathered his family to discuss the matter. They thought about the past and compared it with the present. In the past, his family of five had only six mu of land and were poor peasants. Now, after turning over, they had risen to become middle peasants and also raised a donkey. He said, "My family had nothing to eat in the past and suffered the landlord's anger, I can't even mention it! In the past, we couldn't wear cotton clothes in the winter, but now we wear cotton clothes in September." When they thought of the famine years when the family was scattered outside begging for food, the whole family burst into tears. His son, Shang Xinchang, immediately expressed his determination to follow his father into the army. His father said, "Let's do it, Xinchang, your joining the army is considered filial piety to me. If we don't defeat old Chiang and dig up the roots of the landlords, don't come home!" After being inspired by his father and son, Xinchang's wife's thinking was completely straightened out. She expressed her attitude at the village women's meeting, saying that she would resolutely not hold him back and would send her husband to join the army. The whole village was brewing ideas, with every family discussing sending their sons and husbands to join the army to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and protect their rice bowls. Shang Baogui said to his son, "Our family has been allocated land and grain, and we have food to eat. Changyuan city has not yet been captured, and if old Chiang comes, our rice bowls will not be secure. Our whole family agrees to you joining the army." His son happily registered. Now the whole village has achieved the wishes of parents, wives, and themselves, and sixteen people have registered to join the army.

　　商言城村互相启发
    做到“四愿”才报名
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】长垣十区商言城村群众，经过“想想过去，比比现在”，参军做到四愿（自愿、父愿、母愿、妻愿），全家同意才报名。自村干积极分子从县里开会回来后，经过各种动员大会，就展开各家酝酿，用了想想过去、比比现在的方法，互相启发。村指导员商文志，在县的村干积极分子大会上报了名，决心参军，回家后，他召集全家来讨论，想了想过去比了比现在，过去他五口人仅六亩地，是个贫农，现在翻身后上升为中农，还喂一头驴，他说：“俺家过去没吃的，受地主的气，没法提！过去一冬穿不上棉衣，现在九月里就穿上棉衣啦。”当他们想起灾荒年，一家分散到外讨饭吃时，引起全家抱头痛哭，他儿子商心常，当时即表示坚决随父亲去参军，他父亲说：“干吧，心常，你参军走就算孝敬了我，打不倒老蒋挖不倒地主的根，咱别回家！”心常老婆在他父子俩启发后，思想完全打通了，她在全村妇女大会上表明态度，说她坚决不拉腿，送丈夫参军。全村都在酝酿，家家商量送子送郎参军，打倒蒋介石，保住饭碗。商保桂对他儿子说：“咱家分了地，分了粮，有了吃啦。长垣城还未打，老蒋来了，饭碗还保不住，咱全家同意你去参军。”他儿就高高兴兴地报了名。现在全村做到父母妻子及自己都心愿，参军报名的已有十六人。
