　　Nanweiquan Base Area Villages
　　Mutual Inspections Promote Textile Production
　　[This newspaper's report from Licheng] To universally promote textile production, Nanweiquan base area conducted mutual inspections among villages on the 14th of this month. Four representatives from each village attended (cadres, textile heroes, and active poor peasants), totaling sixteen participants. The inspections covered ideological mobilization in textile production, organizational leadership, equal value distribution of profits, the issue of labor exchange between spinning and weaving, and improving tools to enhance technology. During the exchange of experiences, Liu Fude said, "Cheyuan Village's work is excellent. The entire village has thirteen groups. We inspected eight of them, and they are all voluntarily formed. Wang Peng's group has eight people collectively spinning, and three women are together fluffing cotton, earning one work point for fluffing four catties of cotton." Bai Qiuhua said, "I inspected in Nanweiquan and found that this village has great enthusiasm for textile production. The entire village has eleven collective spinning groups. Sang Baoju and his daughter-in-law used one catty of cotton as capital in the spring for spinning and weaving, sold cloth to buy cotton, and now the whole family is wearing new clothes. They have also saved forty catties of cotton and have taken on three apprentices who have all learned to weave. Their home is like a small factory." Fude said, "The inspection is very good, but the days are short. When I return, I must learn from Cheyuan's textile production and fully organize the women and young girls in our village." After this inspection, confidence was boosted, and everyone eagerly strived to be a model in the next inspection. (Xi Wen)
　　[Another report] Textile production in Chengnai Main Village was initiated by calculating annual yields and comparing family assets, with the poor and hired peasants serving as the backbone. A half-month textile plan was established, and mutual challenges were issued. Under the active leadership of the poor and hired peasants, a ten-day textile inspection was launched on December 12th. The inspection results showed that the ten-day textile production exceeded the half-month textile plan (the original plan was an average of three catties of yarn and one zhang and two chi of cloth per person). The five major teams in the village spun a total of 197 catties of yarn and wove a total of 154 zhang of cloth. Not only was the quantity high, but the quality was also good. For example, Zhang Zhilan's team has now eliminated third-grade yarn and completely produced first and second-grade yarn. Wen Jingzhi's team has now increased the production of extra-grade yarn. Other products, such as plaid cloth, wicker cloth, and quilt covers, were exhibited and evaluated, and a second half-month plan was established. Currently, the teams are brewing discussions on how to improve technology. (Li Qing, Jian Xun, Bu Yuan)
