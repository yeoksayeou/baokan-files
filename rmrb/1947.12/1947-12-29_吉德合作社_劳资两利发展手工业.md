　　Labor-Management Cooperation Develops Handicraft Industry
　　[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] Yangcheng Jide Village Cooperative, operating handicrafts with labor-management cooperation for mutual benefit, has earned a profit of 4,665,440 yuan in nine months. The cooperative summarized its handicraft operations from January to September, achieving great results. Four long-term workers and one short-term worker in the bowl kiln produced 5,040 bundles of bowls (20 bowls per bundle), earning a profit of 1,369,620 yuan. Thirty workers in the vat kiln produced 172 sets of vats, earning a profit of 800,810 yuan. Twenty workers in the coal kiln produced 4,754,100 baskets of coal (80 catties per basket), earning a profit of 3,487,720 yuan. The total profit from these three items amounted to 4,665,440 yuan. The profit-sharing method with workers was changed from fixed wages to a profit-sharing system, and the workers' profit-sharing ratio was appropriately increased, which stimulated the workers' enthusiasm. For example, when the bowl kiln workers implemented the profit-sharing system, the original allocation was 40% for labor and 60% for the cooperative, which was later changed to 55% for labor and 45% for the cooperative. After this change, the workers conscientiously economized. For example, in the past, it took more than 22,000 catties of coal to fire a kiln of bowls, which was later reduced to more than 17,000 catties, and the bowls were also fired very well. At the same time, the leadership constantly paid attention to solving the workers' difficulties and maintaining their high morale. The daily output of coal increased from 250 baskets to 300 baskets. The cooperative's retail store also shifted from a purely profit-making perspective to supplying the people's necessities, such as oil, salt, and medicine, seeking profits only to maintain the livelihood of the cooperative's staff. The cooperative's medicine prices are all lower than market prices, and cotton ginning is ten yuan lower per catty than the market price. This winter, the cooperative plans to produce another 1,260 bundles of bowls, which can earn a profit of 758,000 yuan, and 2,400,000 baskets of coal, which can earn a profit of 2,800,000 yuan.

　　吉德合作社
  　劳资两利发展手工业
    【本报太岳二十七日电】阳城吉德村合作社，以劳资两利经营手工业，九个月盈利四百六十六万五千四百四十元。该合作社总结一至九月的手工业经营，获得很大成绩，烧碗窑四个长工与一个短工，共出碗五千零四十捆（每一捆廿个），赚利一百卅六万九千六百二十元。烧缸窑三十个工人，出缸一百七十二套，赚利八十万零八千一百元。煤窑工廿个，出煤四百七十五万四千一百篓（每篓八十斤），赚利三百四十八万七千七百二十元。共计三宗赚利四百六十六万五千四百四十元。其与工人分红办法是，由固定工资改为分红制，并适当的提高工人的分红比例，使工人发扬了积极性。如碗窑工人实行分红制时，原规定劳力四成，合作社六成，后来改为劳力五成五，合作社四成五。此后，工人便认真的节约，如过去烧一窑碗得用煤二万二千余斤，以后减至一万七千余斤，碗并烧得很好。同时，领导上经常的注意解决工人的困难，保持工人的劳动情绪经常高涨，一日由出二百五十篓煤增加到三百篓。合作社的门市铺，也由单纯的盈利观点，转变为供应群众的必需品，如油、盐、药等，从此中求利能维持合作社人员的生活就行，合作社的药价皆较市价低，轧花每斤较市价低十元，今冬三个月，该合作社计划碗窑再出一千二百六十捆，可赚利七十五万八千元，煤窑出二百四十万篓，赚利二百八十万元。
