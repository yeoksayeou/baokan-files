　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st – TASS, London – At the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the 27th and 28th of last month, the order of procedures for preparing the peace treaty with Germany was discussed. The Soviet Union proposed that the following basic issues should be discussed first: 1. The establishment of a democratic German central government; 2. Convening a conference to deliberate on the draft peace treaty with Germany; 3. Drafting basic guidelines for the peace treaty. It also suggested: 1. The four countries should recognize the establishment of a democratic unified German central government in accordance with the Potsdam Conference decisions, and the Foreign Ministers Conference must consider the proposal to form a German government separately in one region or another as incorrect. 2. The German government should be given the opportunity to state its views on the peace treaty with Germany at the conference. 3. The peace treaty must be signed by the German government and submitted to the German parliament for approval. 4. The conference should be composed of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, China, Germany's neighboring countries, and allied countries that participated in the war against Germany. France proposed that the issue of Germany's territory and boundaries should be discussed first, demanding that Saar become politically independent and economically merged with France. Britain proposed organizing one or several special committees to study Germany's territory and boundaries. The United States supported the French and British suggestions and involved changing the decisions on the Polish-German border in the Potsdam Conference. Because the US, Britain and France lacked the sincerity to genuinely resolve the main issues of Germany, the debate yielded no results after two days, and the conference then decided to discuss the preparatory procedures for the peace treaty in accordance with the draft discussed at the previous Moscow conference, starting from the 29th. During the two-day meeting, Molotov sharply exposed the conspiracy of the US, Britain and France to split Germany's unity and undermine the Potsdam and Yalta agreements. Molotov stated: "The Soviet delegation's impression is that the plan to establish a government in the western two zones and three zones to replace the establishment of a German central government has already been drafted." On October 24, a London broadcast openly stated that a special committee composed of representatives of various parties in the British House of Commons announced that if German economic "unification" was impossible, a representative government of the German occupation zone of two or three zones must be organized. This exposure by Molotov put Bevin, Marshall, and Bidault in an embarrassing situation, and they tried their best to avoid answering directly. However, Bevin and Marshall could not but admit the correctness of the news that Molotov said that the United States, Britain, and France planned to organize a government in western Germany.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd – TASS, Moscow, 30th – A Pravda commentator wrote: The Foreign Ministers Conference held in London will show whether effective cooperation between the great powers will continue. The Soviet Union has consistently upheld the principle of international cooperation. However, it must be pointed out that certain recent actions by the British, American, and French occupation authorities in Germany and newspaper comments on the Foreign Ministers Conference have caused concern among democratic and peace-loving people. Recently, rumors have spread that the British and American occupation authorities have engaged in new actions that violate the Potsdam Agreement. The frenzied clamoring of American congressmen for the resolute and rapid abandonment of any international cooperation does not help the progress of the Foreign Ministers Conference. What the American, British, and French newspapers have done in the past few days also proves that they are only serving to delay cooperation among the great powers. Their comments on the first meeting of the Foreign Ministers Conference are intended to make readers believe that the conference is inevitably doomed to failure, and they unwisely put the responsibility for the failure on the Soviet Union in advance. Obviously, this only shows that reactionaries want to obstruct peace, hinder cooperation among the great powers, and exert pressure on the work of the Foreign Ministers Conference.

　　四外长会议上苏联提议
    德应建民主统一政府
    英美法分裂德国阴谋被揭露贝文马歇尔等陷于狼狈之境
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合塔斯社伦敦讯：四外长会议于上月二十七、二十八两日讨论对德和约准备程序的次序问题。苏联提出首先讨论如下几个基本问题：一、建立民主的德国中央政府；二、召开审议对德和约草案的和会；三、拟草和约的基本指导方针。并建议：一、四国应承认依照波茨顿会议决定建立民主的统一的德国中央政府，外长会议并须认为在这一区域或那一区域单独组成德国政府的建议是不正确的。二、予德国政府在和会中陈述其对德和约意见之机会。三、和约必须由德国政府签字并交与德国议会批准。四、和会由苏、美、英、法、中及德国邻国和参加对德作战之盟国组成。法国提出首先讨论德国之领土与疆界问题，要求萨尔在政治上独立，经济上合并于法国。英国提议组织一个或数个特别委员会，来研究德国的领土与疆界。美国支持法英建议，并涉及改变波茨顿会议中关于波德疆界的决定。由于美英法缺乏真正解决德国主要问题的诚意，争辩两日迄无结果，会议旋即决定自二十九日起，依照上次在莫斯科会议时所讨论的草案，以讨论对德和约的准备程序。两日之会中莫洛托夫尖锐揭露美英法企图分裂德国的统一及破坏波茨顿与雅尔塔协定的阴谋。莫氏称：“苏联代表团获得的印象是：建立西部两区和三区政府以代替建立德国中央政府的计划，已经被拟就。”十月二十四日的伦敦广播中，公然说英国下院各党派代表所组成的特别委员会宣布，如果德国经济“统一”不可能，则必须组织两占领或三占领区的德国代议制政府。莫氏的这种揭露，使贝文、马歇尔、比道尔陷于狼狈之境，尽力设法避免正面答复。但贝文与马歇尔却不能不承认莫洛托夫所说美英法拟在西部德国组织政府的消息底正确性。
    【新华社陕北二日电】塔斯社莫斯科卅日讯：真理报政论家撰文称：伦敦所举行的外长会议，将表明强国间之有效合作是否继续下去。苏联是一贯维护国际合作原则的。但必须指出：德境英美法占领当局的最近某些行为及报纸对外长会议的评论，都引起民主和平人士的忧虑。最近传闻英美占领当局又有新的违反波茨顿协议的行为。美国会议员疯狂的叫嚣坚决而迅速的放弃任何国际合作，这种行为，对外长会议之进展毫无帮助。美英法报纸这几天的所作所为，也证明他们只是为延宕强国合作而效劳，他们对外长会议第一次会的评论，图使读者相信会议不可避免的要失败，并且不聪明的事前把失败的责任加在苏联的头上。显然的，这只是表示反动分子们要阻挠和平、阻碍强国合作及对外长会议之工作施以压力。
