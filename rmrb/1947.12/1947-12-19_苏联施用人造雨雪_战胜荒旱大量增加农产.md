Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture has recently drafted an irrigation plan for the central agricultural regions, determining that large amounts of artificial rain will be used. Sophisticated machinery for spraying rain on large tracts of land has now been tested and completed. The result of using artificial rain is to increase wheat production by 30 centners per hectare (one hectare equals 16 mu) and sugar beet production by 530 centners per hectare. Soviet scientists are vigorously assisting in the development of agriculture. After the severe drought last winter, Soviet scientists guided farmers to cover tens of millions of hectares of vast land with artificial snow to increase soil moisture, which was a major reason for this year's unprecedented bumper harvest. The 20,000 collective farm experiment stations that had ceased operations during the war have been restored and are helping farmers with seed selection, fertilization, pest control, and other tasks. For example, the "Livestock Farm" collective farm experimented this year with a new wheat variety created by academician Antonov by crossbreeding wheat and couch grass, which resulted in an increase of 35 centners per hectare in wheat yield. For example, the cotton picking work, which previously relied solely on manual labor, has this year been replaced by newly designed cotton picking machines, which can pick cotton from 20 to 25 hectares per day.

    苏联施用人造雨雪
    战胜荒旱大量增加农产
    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联农业部顷为中部农业地区拟定一灌溉计划，确定将大量施用人造雨。在大块土地上洒雨之精制机器，现已试验完成，施用人造雨之结果，足使每公顷（一公顷合十六市亩）小麦增产三十生丁纳（一生丁纳合一百市斤），甜菜增产五百三十生丁纳。苏联科学家正以大力协助发展农业。去冬严重荒旱之后，苏联科学家曾指导农民在数千万公顷之广漠土地上，覆以人造雪，以增加土中水分，成为今年空前丰收的一大原因。在战时停止工作之两万个集体农庄实验所，已告恢复，正帮助农民进行选种、施肥、防虫等工作，如“牧畜场”集体农庄，今年试种大学士安东诺夫以小麦与茅草交配成之新种小麦，结果使每公顷小麦产量增加三十五生丁纳。如过去仅赖人工之摘棉工作，今年已由新设计之摘棉机代替，每日能摘棉花二十至二十五公顷。
