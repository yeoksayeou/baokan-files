    The Three Check-Ups Study of the Linshan Theater Troupe
    Yang Ruizhi, Sun Keming, Wu Chengxi
    After seeing the District Party Committee's instructions on the Three Check-Ups, the Taiyue Linshan Theater Troupe launched an enthusiastic study and examination movement for more than 20 days, from August 18th to September 14th. Everyone corrected their stance, clarified class boundaries, liquidated landlord thinking, and eliminated stubborn landlord elements.
    In this study, Deputy Instructor Yang Yuhong took the lead by setting an example. He said, "My position was incorrect in the past, and I acted as a bomb shelter for the landlords. When the masses liquidated my family last August, my family secretly hid sixteen or seventeen shi of wheat and some clothes (worth about 20,000 yuan). This matter was a heavy burden on my mind, so my work enthusiasm was not high..." After the ideological examination, on September 9th, when the theater troupe performed in Ling Village, ten li away from his home, he personally went home and admitted his mistakes to the village cadres, telling them where the hidden wheat and clothes were. Since then, he has been relieved of the burden in his mind and has been able to work with peace of mind. Under his influence, other comrades also conducted self-examinations.
    Comrade Zhang Guizhi is a famous actor from Shangdang. His family was very poor, and he learned opera from a young age. At the age of fourteen, he mastered the basics, and at the age of fifteen, he sang opera in Taiyuan, approaching Yan Xishan's cadre, the great traitor Ma Jun, as well as many other officials. Ma Jun even gave him a banner called "Guilin Yizhi Dan" (meaning "the best Dan actress"). Later, he lived in the "Sanle Class" of the local tyrant of Lucheng. Therefore, although he was born into a poor family, he developed the habit of climbing up and currying favor with landlords and officials, and he looked down on the poor. In this ideological introspection, he said, "I am a poor person with 'rich thinking'. In the past, I was indeed in a mess. Since joining the theater troupe, although I work in the theater troupe, I have a lot of landlord thinking. Now I realize that I was influenced by landlords and local tyrants, which hindered my progress. In the future, I must separate from landlord thinking and stand on the position of the basic masses to serve the masses."
    There is also Comrade Wang Chengzi, an old artist with low skills and culture. Before joining the theater troupe, he suffered endless oppression and exploitation from the foreman. This time, he poured out all his bitterness and felt that he had not only turned over economically but also politically. He said happily, "In the past, the landlord treated us differently. Today, the leadership treats us all equally. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, I would not be able to turn over even if I died. Chairman Mao is really my savior, even closer than my parents..."
    In the enthusiastic movement of speaking out about suffering and self-examination in the entire theater troupe, landlord Li Haijin was uncovered. Since joining the theater troupe during the famine years, Li Haijin has consistently worked very badly. Not only did he repeatedly refuse to mend his ways, but he also often spread rumors and sabotage. For example, during this meritorious service movement, he said, "You can eat noodles even without meritorious service. Meritorious service is using people..." After everyone traced the roots, they found that he was from a bankrupt landlord family and had always been a local ruffian. Everyone decided to expel him and hand him over to the masses in his village for handling.
    After this three check-ups study, the entire theater troupe was renewed, and every comrade consciously strove to perform meritorious service in their work ideologically, and showed unprecedented unity.

    麟山剧团的三查学习
    杨瑞芝  孙克明  武承熙
    太岳麟山剧团自看到区党委的三查指示后，全团自八月十八日至九月十四日二十多天内，展开了热烈的学习、检查运动。大家端正了立场，划清了阶级界线，清算了地主思想，和清除了顽固不化的地主分子。
    在这次学习中，副指导员杨玉鸿同志首先以身作则，他说：“在以前我的立场不对，做了地主的防空洞。去年八月群众清算我家时，家里还暗藏了十六、七石麦子和一部分衣服（约值两万元）。这件事在我思想上是个大包袱，因此工作情绪不高………”。思想检查后，九月九日剧团在岭村出演时，离他家十里地，他亲自回家，向村干部承认了错误，把藏麦子和衣服的地方向村干部说了。从此在思想上才放下了包袱，工作也安心了。在他的影响下，其他同志都自动地进行了检查。
    张贵枝同志是上党的名角。家里很穷，从小就学戏，十四岁上就学成了把式，十五岁曾到太原唱过戏，接近过阎锡山的干部大奸霸马骏，还有其他好多当官的，马骏还送给他一面旗，叫“桂林一枝旦”。以后又住过潞城大恶霸的“三乐班”。所以虽是穷人出身，却养成往上爬、巴结地主当官的毛病，看不起穷人。在这次思想反省中，他说：“我是个穷人‘富思想’，过去的确是一塌糊涂，自参加剧团后，虽然工作在剧团，却有很多地主思想。现在才认识到以前是受了地主、恶霸的影响，妨碍了自己的进步，以后一定要和地主思想分家，站在基本群众的立场上，为群众服务。”
    还有王成子同志，是个技术、文化都较低的旧艺人，未参加剧团以前，受掌班的压迫与剥削，真是说不完的苦楚，这次倒尽了苦水，感到自己现在不仅在经济上翻了身，而且在政治上也翻了身，他高兴地说：“过去东家对咱是两样看待，今天领导上对咱们一律平等，要不是共产党、八路军来，我就是死也翻不了身，毛主席真是我的救命恩人，比爹娘还亲……”。
    在全团热烈的诉苦、检查运动中，清查出地主李海金。李海金自灾荒年参加剧团以来，一贯工作很坏，不但屡劝不改，反而常常造谣破坏。如在这次立功运动中他说：“不立功也要吃面，立功是利用人啦……”。经大家追根，才追出他是破产地主出身，过去一贯是个地痞流氓。大家决定把他清除出去，交给他村群众处理。
    经过这次三查学习后，全团气象一新，每个同志都从思想上自觉地争着在工作中立功，并表现了空前的团结。
