[This report from our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, on the 2nd] Late-arriving news: After the local armed forces of the Huxi District swept through the Fengpei area to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the masses held meetings to celebrate their liberation. Last month, our local armed forces completely annihilated more than 100 people from the Chiang Kai-shek district public office southeast of Luankou in Pei County, capturing more than 30 alive, and seizing two machine guns and more than 30 rifles. On the same day, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Zhangji "Township Public Office" was surrounded by us, and more than 20 enemies resisted stubbornly. Our local corps immediately opened fire, and the pseudo-township chief's building and Chiang Kai-shek bandit township chief Liu Zhaobo were eliminated at the same time, and the remaining 19 people were captured alive. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' stubborn strongholds of Dongji and Houweizi "Township Public Offices" in Fengbei fled in all directions under the might of our army, and that stronghold was removed by us that night. On the morning of the 11th, our local corps once again attacked the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Pei County Security Team, killing or wounding more than 60 people below the rank of company commander, and capturing one machine gun and two hand cannons. In the four days from the 7th to the 11th, more than 400 Chiang Kai-shek bandits were annihilated, and 100,000 people in the Fengpei area were liberated. After the masses in the Shouqun District of Feng County were liberated, they gathered in Sanzuolou Village to celebrate the liberation of the district. Political Commissar Xu immediately swore an oath to the liberated masses, determined to share life and death with the people of the Shouqun District, and announced the cancellation of the Chiang Kai-shek pseudo-regime and the Baojia organization, and established a mass liberation headquarters to lead the land reform.
