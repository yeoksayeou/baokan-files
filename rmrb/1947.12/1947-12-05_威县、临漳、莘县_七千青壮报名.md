　　【Jinan News, Hebei, 3rd Dispatch】 Weixian's liberated farmers, under the slogan "March on Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and liberate the people of the whole country," saw 4,500 young men throughout the county enlist in the army in half a month. Most villages conducted prior preparation through farmer's meetings, group discussions, and family meetings. In the city, 160 young men enlisted, and after strict review, 70 were approved. The towns of Qi Ji, Dasi Zhuang, and Zhao Village have all established counter-offensive companies. Stories of parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers vying with each other could be heard everywhere during the enlistment. In Shao Gu Village, 16 fathers sent their sons, and they even went to the new recruits' registration point to declare: We are completely voluntarily sending our sons to join the army. When the three Ke brothers in Su Village held a family meeting to discuss who should enlist, the eldest brother said, "You two are already married, stay home and work." The second brother said, "Elder brother hasn't started a family, you shouldn't go. Younger brother is still young, I'll register." The youngest brother said, "If elder brother hasn't started a family, I agree he shouldn't go this time. Second brother can do work and small business, if you stay home, you won't have to worry about life, I'll go." The three brothers argued and couldn't decide, so they all agreed to let their father and mother decide. In the end, the youngest brother registered.
　　
　　【Jinan News, Hebei, 3rd Dispatch】 Linzhang's liberated farmers, under the call to "Think about the past, compare it with the present, clarify your thinking, and join the main force," have launched an upsurge in enlisting in the army, with 2,000 young men already registered. At a mobilization meeting for village cadres and activists in the fourth district to join the army, 410 people registered on the spot. More than 40 young women, including Ma Airong, the director of the Women's Association of Ge Liu Village, and Wang Xiurong, a woman from Wu Cha Kou, volunteered to send their husbands to join the army. Wang Zhenguo, the militia captain of Sanjie Temple, after returning from a meeting in the district, mobilized his son, saying, "Think about when your uncle farmed for others, and the landlord wanted to build a house, we couldn't even bring back our dead when someone died at home. Your brother died in the coal mine. This is all because of poverty! The Eighth Route Army came, and we got land and houses. Child, if we don't join the army, who will?" Hearing this, both his children clamored to register. Du Yucheng's mother in Hou Xiaozhuang Village, who is now sixty years old, suffered poverty and mistreatment her whole life. During this enlistment, she convened a family meeting and said, "We have been liberated, and we have food to eat, but we still have to join the army to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, that bad egg." First, she persuaded her son and nephew, then she persuaded her two nephews, and then she persuaded her grandson. In two hours, this old woman had persuaded these seven young men.
　　
　　【Jinan News, Hebei, 3rd Dispatch】 Over a thousand young men in Shenxian voluntarily enlisted in the army. Initially, a farmer's meeting was held to mourn the refugees who died in the famine years, recall the bitterness of the past, and arouse the courage for revenge. Then, the meeting turned to complaining about the suffering, tracing it back to the old roots of the landlord class, Chiang Kai-shek, making the masses realize that only by joining the army to defeat Chiang Kai-shek can they avenge their grievances. Finally, the meeting discussed Chiang Kai-shek's inevitable defeat and our inevitable victory, establishing confidence in victory, and inspiring the masses to automatically embark on the path of joining the army for revenge. After preparation in the fourth district, a memorial meeting was held to mourn the refugees who were forced to death by the landlords and complain about the suffering. After this, more than 400 people in the entire district voluntarily registered to join the army. They unanimously swore: "We will never go home until we defeat Old Chiang." Then, at a mobilization meeting for the entire community to join the army, after Yang Huailin, the public security officer of the community, registered, 122 people successively joined the army. At a meeting of more than 400 cadres in the sixth district, 75 young men, including Zhang Fengxiang, voluntarily registered.
