Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: Moscow dispatch: The delegation of the French Railway Workers' Federation, which recently arrived in the Soviet Union for a visit, held a press conference at the Labor Daily office here on the 8th. At the meeting, the head of the delegation, Tony Meunier, General Secretary of the French Railway Workers' Union, refuted the American warmonger Dulles, saying: After Dulles' recent visit to Paris, he issued a statement slandering the French Communist Party as not being a French party. His words are merely repeating Hitler's words. When Hitler's followers shot communists, they always said, "They are not French." Dulles' recent visit to France marks a new stage in the penetration of American imperialism into France. Mr. Tony Meunier emphasized the leading role of French railway workers in the resistance movement. He also said that the French Railway Workers' Federation is the largest organization of the French working class, with 500,000 members out of a total of 579,000 railway workers. When asked about the French General Confederation of Labor's attitude towards the Marshall Plan, Mr. Tony Meunier strongly stated that the vast majority of the General Confederation of Labor opposes this plan to enslave France.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 16th: Moscow dispatch: The delegation of the French National Railway Workers' Federation left the Soviet Union on the 11th to return to France after a 25-day visit. The delegation was led by Tony Meunier, General Secretary of the French National Railway Workers' Federation, and included leaders of railway unions from northern France, Nantes, Alsace and Lorraine, eastern France, and other regions. During their stay in the Soviet Union, the delegation gained a deep understanding of the achievements of Soviet railways, trade union activities, and the people's lives. At a reception for reporters at the Labor Daily editorial office on the 8th, Meunier told Soviet reporters: We have seen that all sectors of your country's life are realizing the Five-Year Plan, and the people's welfare is rapidly growing. He also said that the unanimous opinion of the delegation is that all Soviet people are working hard for peaceful construction. We will tell the French people this, which will help consolidate French-Soviet friendship. We will tell them that the Soviet people want peace and security and uphold the independence of all countries. The issue of independence and peace is now very important for France, because recent events have proven that foreign countries are interfering in French internal affairs.
