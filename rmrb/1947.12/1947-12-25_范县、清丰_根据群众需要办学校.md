　　【Benbao Jiluyu Twenty-third Electric】The Propaganda Department of the Fanxian County Party Committee, in coordination with the Culture and Education Section, in order to raise the consciousness of the masses and lay the foundation for future adult education, specially opened a mass school teacher training class on the fifth of this month. A total of 254 students attended, all of whom were the main cadres in the villages. This corrected the previous problem that illiterate people could not be winter school teachers. The meeting discussed the reasons why winter schools were not well run in the past, why mass schools should be run this year, and how to combine them with the central work. The training method was to first inspire group brainstorming and discussion, then report on the results, and the leaders would summarize based on the reports, using the method of the masses learning from the masses. Therefore, many students said: "This way of using your brain to think of more methods is much better than just listening to lectures. We must do a good job when we go back." The Qingfeng Fourth District teacher conference decided that winter schools should be combined with mass production. At the meeting, most people complained that the masses despised the schools and looked down on the teachers. They also discussed in groups why the masses looked down on the teachers and schools, and whether the masses currently have a demand for cultural emancipation. During the group discussions, it was believed that it was not a matter of the masses looking down on them, but that the teachers had not mobilized deeply and that the teaching methods were not linked to the interests of the masses. For example, the Machang Elementary School did not give the masses a holiday when they asked for it during the autumn harvest, and only gave them a holiday when the autumn harvest was almost over. The masses said: "Your school makes us study more when we are busiest, delaying our work!" How can the masses respect the school like this? We should check whether what we are doing is to the taste of the masses. After several days of inspection and discussion, everyone clarified that whether it is adult education or children's education, as long as it can be combined with mass production and follow the mass line, it can gain the support of the masses. The Jiangguantun Winter School in the Sixth District of Zhuxian, according to everyone's requirements, teaches whatever they want to learn. After the school started on the 19th of last month, it was divided into literacy groups, abacus groups, and newspaper reading groups. Each group elected two leaders, a leader and a deputy leader. That night, Li Yuechen said: "I must first learn the characters for pig, cattle, sheep, meat, oil, catty, and tael, because I will use them soon." Li Donglin said: "I want to recognize how many bowls of mung bean balls there are." That night, according to Li Yuechen's requirements, they practiced a lesson on opening a slaughterhouse. The rest were also based on their requirements, and the characters were written in their notebooks. Li Yuechen said: "This is great, if I study like this for a month, I will be able to keep accounts and I won't have to ask anyone for help." Now, after a month of school, they initially taught many characters according to everyone's needs, and later added reading newspapers and talking about current affairs. Everyone arrives quickly and on time every night, and their learning enthusiasm is very high.

　　Family Members and Children's School Studies Production to Support the Front
　　【Benbao Jiluyu Twenty-second Electric】The Revolutionary Family Members and Children's School of the Second Commissioner's Office combines learning with production. The production income, in addition to a portion for self-sufficiency, is also actively donated to support the front lines. Since the beginning of November, in their spare time, college students have been winding thread for factories, and elementary school students have been selling cigarettes. According to statistics in just ten days, they have made a profit of more than 40,000 yuan. Those with good grades can support themselves up to one-half, and those with poor grades can support themselves up to one-quarter. Because they are all children of revolutionary comrades, their ideological awareness is also relatively high, and they are particularly active in supporting the front lines. After they received the money earned from ten days of labor, they immediately contributed more than 16,000 yuan to support the front lines. Liang Xinglu, an eleven-year-old elementary school student, donated all of the more than 1,900 yuan he earned from selling cigarettes, saying: "I am small and useless, and I can't go to the front to fight Lao Jiang, so I will donate this money to the front lines."

　　范县、清丰
  　根据群众需要办学校
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】范县县委宣传部配合文教科，为提高群众觉悟，并为将来之成年教育打下基础，特于本月五日开办群校教员训练班，共到学员二百五十四名，全是村中的主要干部，纠正了以往不识字不能当冬学教员的毛病。会上研究过去冬学为啥没办好？今年为啥要办群校？如何与中心工作结合等问题。训练办法是首先启发分组酝酿讨论，进行汇报，领导上根据汇报向大家作出总结，以群众向群众学的办法来进行训练。所以许多学员说：“这样用脑子多想办法，比光听讲好的多，回去非好好办不可。”清丰四区教员大会，决定冬学与群众生产结合，会议上，大部都诉苦，说群众轻视学校，看不起教员等。又分组酝酿群众为什么轻视咱们教员和学校？目前群众有没有文化翻身要求？在小组讨论时，认为不是群众轻视的问题，而是咱教员们没深入动员，在教法上和群众利益连系不起来。如马厂完小在秋收时，群众要求放假就不放假，等秋收快完了才放假，群众说：“您这学校越忙越念书，将活都耽误了！”就象这样群众会看起了吗？应该检查咱们作的是否合群众的口味？经过了几天的检查和讨论，大家明确了无论成年教育、儿童教育，只要能结合群众生产、走群众路线，都能取得群众拥护。筑先六区蒋官屯冬学，根据大家要求，想学啥就教啥，该村于上月十九号开学后，分了识字组、算盘组、读报组，各组举出正副组长二人，当晚李月臣说：“我得先学猪、牛、羊、肉、油、斤、两等字，马上就要用。”李冬林说：“我认绿豆丸子几碗。”当晚根据了李月臣的要求，就练了开宰房一课。其余的也都依据了他们的要求，将字写在他们的小本上，李月臣说：“这可好了，我这样学一个月，就会记帐了，可不求人啦”。现在开学一月光景，开始根据大家的需要多教字，后来又加上读报谈时事，每晚到的又快又齐，学习情绪非常高。
  　家属子弟学校学习生产支前
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】二专署革命家属子弟学校，学习与生产结合，生产所得除一部自给外，还积极输捐支援前线。该校自十一月初起，在课余时间，大学生给工厂络线，小学生卖烟，仅十天的统计，即获利四万余元，成绩好者自给到二分之一，成绩差的能自给到四分之一。因为他们都是革命同志的子弟，所以思想觉悟也较高，对支援前线也特别积极。当他们拿到十天劳动所获之款后，即摊出一万六千多元，支援前线，十一岁的小学生梁星路，把卖烟赚到的一千九百多元，全部献出，他说：“我小不中大用，不能上前方打老蒋，就把我这点钱捐给前线上吧。”
