　　Xiwu Base Point
  　Inspection Promotes Textile Production
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] The Xiwu Base Point in the First District, in order to launch a large-scale winter textile campaign, specifically convened a meeting of cadres and activists from the six main villages in the base point on November 25th to inspect and promote textile work. Based on the reports from each village and the actual situation of the textile work, evaluations were made. Everyone unanimously agreed that the textile work in Dongshuiyang Village was progressing well. Zhang Waitu, the chairman of the Dongshuiyang Farmers' Association, said: "Dongshuiyang is tightly focused on textile production, with great enthusiasm. As soon as the autumn harvest ended, they quickly transitioned to textile work. Women are spinning at night. Within five days, 110 women combined picking late cotton and spun 72 jin of thread and wove 51 zhang of cloth." After inspection and evaluation, small groups were formed for discussion to set plans. Women in Dongshuiyang Kengxi Village set a plan that each spinning woman, in addition to doing odd jobs, should complete 4 jin of thread per month (including spinning and weaving) and proposed to definitely spin black thread. Xishuiyang proposed in its planning that it must improve technology in textile production, ensuring that the weaving is good enough to sell, improve tools, and strive to buy an automatic winding machine. All 721 women in the entire base point will complete 2589.4 jin of cloth (including spinning and weaving) within one month, and set up a system of weighing thread every five days, checking every seven days, and summarizing every ten days in the villages, and conducting competitions between villages. Finally, when discussing how to organize the poor and hired laborers to carry out winter production, after debate, everyone unanimously agreed that the poor and hired women must lead the textile groups, unite the middle peasants, and manage the landlord women to carry out production. Currently, each village is carrying out inspections one after another. (Ren Qing, Feng Chen)

　　西仵基点
  　检查推动纺织
    【本报黎城讯】一区西仵基点，为开展大规模的冬季纺织运动，特于十一月廿五日召开了全基点六个主村干部积极分子会议，检查推动纺织工作。根据各村的汇报与纺织工作实际情形进行评判，大家一致认为东水洋村的纺织工作开展的好。西水洋农会主席张歪秃说：“东水洋纺织抓的紧，劲头儿大，秋收一结束，即很快转上纺织，妇女黑夜纺织，五天内一百一十个妇女结合摘晚花，还纺了七十二斤线，织了五十一丈布”。经过检查评判后，又划分小组讨论，定出计划。东水洋坑西村妇女订出计划，每个纺妇每月除做杂活外，还要完成四斤线（连纺带织），并提出一定要搭黑纺线。西水洋在订计划中提出，在纺织上一定要提高技术，做到织的好能出卖，改良工具，争取买一架自动自卷机。全基点七百二十一个妇女，在一月内要完成二千五百八十九．四斤布（连纺带织），并订出在村里五天一秤线，七天一检查，十天一总结，村与村进行竞赛。最后在讨论到如何组织贫雇进行冬季生产时，经过争论，大家一致意见，在纺织组里必须贫雇妇女领导，团结中农，管理地主妇女来进行生产。现各村正先后进行检查。（任卿、逢辰）
