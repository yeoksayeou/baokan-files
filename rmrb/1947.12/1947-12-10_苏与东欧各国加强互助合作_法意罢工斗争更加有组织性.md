　　The great activity and strengthening of commercial and diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Eastern European new democratic countries, as well as between the new democratic countries themselves, is one of the most significant international events of the week. The Soviet Union and Finland signed an equal and mutually beneficial trade treaty in Moscow on the 1st, and concluded an agreement on mutual exchange of materials for 1948. Hungary and Romania also signed a cultural cooperation agreement between the two countries on November 27, and are now discussing a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between the two countries. Marshal Tito's visit to Bulgaria on November 25 successfully concluded a 20-year treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, specifically stipulating military mutual assistance, which has guaranteed the security, independence, and territorial integrity of the two countries. Marshal Tito has now set off for Hungary, and it is expected that the friendly relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia will be further developed. All of this shows that the Soviet Union and Eastern European new democratic countries are continuing to strengthen and develop their friendship and great unity, thus severely打击 hitting those imperialists who attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Balkan countries and undermine their independence, becoming the "best guarantee" of peace in Southeast Europe and even the world.

　　The flames of the heroic struggle of the French working class to defend the freedom and glory of the motherland are burning even more fiercely due to the reactionary派's mad suppression. In many places, it has developed into fierce bloody struggles. The Schumann executioner government, encouraged by Marshall's "vigorous support" and under the secret instructions of American war criminal Dulles, who rushed to Paris, on the one hand, disregarded the resolute protests of the French Communist Party members and demanded that the French parliament grant it emergency powers to implement armed suppression. So far, the parliament has passed reactionary measures such as enlisting 80,000 reservists. On the other hand, it colluded with the social party that betrayed the nation, cunningly resorted to tricks, and tried to split and sabotage the strike camp. But the reactionary party cannot suppress the French working class with its glorious fighting tradition, and the conspiracy of division is destined to go bankrupt. The General Confederation of Labor has warned the government that if the "emergency measures" become law, the General Confederation of Labor will never negotiate with the government; the General Confederation of Labor has also urgently called on all French workers to mobilize, expand the struggle to defend their movement and organization; and pointed out with confidence that workers and democrats are strong enough to stop this crime. Under the organized leadership of the General Confederation of Labor, the suppression by the reactionary party is like adding fuel to the fire, making the strike even more surging. The Government Employees Union, which has two million members, has decided to strike on the 8th, and some have already started. The Store Employees Union, which has 250,000 members, is still in negotiations, but strike orders have been issued in Paris, Marseille, and other places. The armed suppression by military and police has aroused resolute resistance from the workers, causing casualties on both sides. At the same time, the so-called "back-to-work movement" instigated by the Social Party has been spurned by the broad masses of workers.

　　In Italy, all workers in Milan, under the unified leadership of the Central Committee organized by the Italian Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and various democratic groups, held a one-day general strike and a majestic demonstration of tens of thousands of people on November 28 to oppose the government's provocation of removing Churioliyo, the incumbent Milan County Zhang and former guerrilla fighter. The demonstrating workers occupied the county government and various important public institutions in an orderly manner. Similar demonstrations have also been held in Sicily, Mantua, Genoa, Venice, and other places. Andi Xiu, the former guerrilla leader who personally shot Mussolini, said to 20,000 demonstrators in Genoa: "If the anti-fascist law is not passed by the constituent assembly, the people have a sacred right to implement it." This fully reflects the heroic spirit of the Italian people in resolutely demanding democracy.

　　This vigorous and righteous struggle of the working class in France and Italy has shown two prominent characteristics: one is the excellent organization of the strike. In France, under the General Confederation of Labor, there is a National Strike Committee, and the Strike Committee has organized a Strike Support Committee, rationally allocating materials and powerfully supporting the strike. In Italy, under the unified leadership of the General Confederation of Labor, production committees have been organized everywhere, and factories and cities have been occupied and taken over in an orderly manner. This organization is the source of the working class's natural excellent tradition and invincible strength. The second is that all sympathy is on the side of the workers. This is not only because the Romanian General Confederation of Labor and American maritime workers have expressed deep sympathy and support for French workers, but more importantly, the armed soldiers of the two countries sympathize with the workers. This is a matter of great symbolic significance. It is no accident that the Humanite newspaper attaches particular importance to the fact that soldiers in Saint-Étienne, France, refused to suppress the reactionary order against the workers. In Milan, not only did the garrison commander refuse to obey the reactionary order to guard against the workers, but many policemen took the initiative to help the striking workers maintain order. If this alliance of workers, soldiers, and police continues to develop, it is obviously a fatal blow to the reactionary parties in France and Italy.

　　The United Nations General Assembly closed on November 30 after two and a half months of fierce debate. The Soviet delegation's solemn stance and resolute struggle made the greatest contribution to defending the United Nations. In particular, the passage of the case condemning war-mongers, proposed and insisted upon by the Soviet delegation, won a moral victory for the Soviet delegation and the world's mankind. The reactionary attack launched by the American delegation from the beginning to amend the charter and abolish the principle of great power unanimity went bankrupt shamefully. The three cases passed by the General Assembly—the Small Assembly, the Balkan and Korean Committees—as pointed out by the New Era, are more of an expenditure or failure than an income for the United States. Because their passage not only exposes the hideous face of the United States in destroying the United Nations General Assembly, but also, due to the refusal of the Soviet Union and other democratic countries to participate, has turned the above three institutions into powerless and illegal illegitimate children.

　　The London Foreign Ministers' Conference has been going on for more than ten days. Due to the deliberate attempts by the United States, Britain, and France to undermine the Yalta and Potsdam agreements and to realize an imperialist peace, the conference has not reached any major agreement on the issue of preparing procedures for the German peace treaty. At the meeting, the Soviet representative showed a righteous spirit of striving to defend the resolutions of previous international conferences, but the US-British group thoroughly exposed the sinister plot to split Germany, thus putting them in an embarrassing situation.

　　The coup d'état in Thailand instigated by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the public defense of Japanese war criminals by Meiren Jinnan, the chief prosecutor of the Tokyo International Tribunal, are one of the steps taken by the United States in the Far East to support the revival of the original fascist forces. This action will inevitably arouse the vigilance and opposition of the people of various countries in the Far East. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 苏与东欧各国加强互助合作  法意罢工斗争更加有组织性

　　苏与东欧各国加强互助合作
    法意罢工斗争更加有组织性
    苏联和东欧新民主国家，以及新民主国家相互之间商业和外交关系的大为活跃和加强，是一周来国际上有重大意义的事件之一。苏联与芬兰一日在莫斯科签订了平等互惠的通商条约，并缔结了一九四八年度的物资互换协定。匈牙利与罗马尼亚亦于上月二十七日签订了两国的文化合作协定，现在商订两国的友好合作互助条约。铁托元帅上月二十五日保加利亚之行，已胜利完成了南、保两国廿年友好合作与互助条约，具体规定军事上的互助，已保障两国的安全、独立与领土之完整。铁托元帅现已启程赴匈，预料匈、南两国间的友好关系，将有进一步的发展。这一切说明，苏联与东欧新民主国家正继续加强发展彼此之间的友谊大团结，因而严重地打击了那些企图干涉巴尔干国家内政，破坏他们独立的帝国主义者。成为东南欧乃至全世界和平的“最佳保证”。
    法国工人阶级为保卫祖国自由与光荣的英勇斗争之怒火，因反动派的疯狂镇压而更炽烈地燃烧起来了。在许多地方，已发展成为激烈的流血斗争。舒曼刽子手政府，在马歇尔“竭力支持”的鼓励下，在匆匆赶赴巴黎之美国战犯杜勒斯的面授机宜下，一面不顾法共议员的坚决抗议，要求法议会授以实施武装镇压的紧急特权，迄今为止，议会已通过了征召八万后备军入伍等反动措施。一面又与叛变民族的社会党一起，狡施诡计，力图分裂和破坏罢工阵营。但是反动派是镇压不了具有光荣战斗传统的法国工人阶级的，分裂的阴谋也是注定非破产不可的。总工会已警告政府，如“紧急措施”一旦成为法律，总工会将决不与政府谈判；总工会同时又紧急号召全法工人动员起来，为保卫他们的运动、组织而扩大斗争；并充满信心地指出：工人和民主人士已强大到足以制止这种罪行。在总工会有组织的领导下，反动派的镇压恰如火上加油，使罢工怒涛更为澎湃。拥有二百万会员之政府雇员联盟已决定八日罢工，部分已经开始。拥有二十五万会员之店员工会虽仍在谈判，但罢工令业已下达巴黎、马赛等地，军警之武装弹压，引起工人的坚决反击，使双方均有死伤。同时，在社会党策动下的所谓“复工运动”，却遭到了广大工人群众的唾弃。
    在意大利，米兰市全体工人在意共与社会党及各民主团体所组织的中央委员会统一领导下，上月二十八日举行了一日总罢工与万人的雄伟示威，反对政府撤换前游击队员现任米兰县张初里约的挑衅。示威工人占领了县府及各重要公共机关，秩序井然。西西里、曼都亚、热那亚、威尼斯等地也先后举行了相同的示威。亲身枪毙墨索里尼的前游击队领袖安迪秀在向热那亚二万示威群众演说时力称：“如反法西斯的法律不为制宪议会所通过，则人民有神圣权利使之实施。”这充分反映出意国人民坚决要求民主的英勇气概。
    这次法意两国工人阶级轰轰烈烈的正义斗争，已显出两个突出的特点：其一是罢工优良的组织性。法国在总工会之下有全国罢工委员会，罢委会又组织了罢工后援委员会，合理分配物资，有力的支持罢工。意大利亦在总工会的统一领导下，到处组织了生产委员会，有秩序的占领接收工厂和城市。这种组织性正是工人阶级天然的优良传统和不可战胜的力量的源泉。其二是一切同情都在工人方面。这不但在国际上有罗马尼亚总工会及美国海员工人对法国工人之深表同情与支援，而更重要的是两国武装士兵的同情工人。这是具有重大象征意义的事情。人道报纸特别重视法国圣德田城士兵的拒绝镇压工人的反动命令，不是偶然的。在米兰不仅警备司令拒绝服从警戒工人的反动命令，而且许多警察更主动帮助罢工工人维持秩序，如果工人与士兵与警察的这种联合继续发展下去，显然是法、意反动派的致命伤。
    联大经过两个半月的激烈辩争，已于上月三十日闭幕，苏联代表团严正的立场与坚决的斗争，对保卫联合国，作了最大的贡献，尤其苏联代表团所提出和坚持的谴责战争贩子案之通过，给苏联代表团和世界人类赢得了道义上的胜利。美国代表团一开始所发动的修改宪章取消大国一致原则的反动进攻，是可耻地破产了。大会所通过的小型大会、巴尔干与朝鲜委员会三案，正如新时代所指出的，与其说是美国的收入，不如说是它的支出或失败。因为它们的通过，不仅暴露出美国破坏联大的狰狞面目，而且因苏联等民主国家的拒绝参加，已使上述三个机构，变成了无力和违法的私生儿。
    伦敦外长会议已经开了十余天，由于美英法蓄意破坏雅尔塔、波茨顿协定，力图实现帝国主义的和平，使会议在对德和约准备程序问题上，迄无任何重大协议。会上，苏联代表处处表现为保卫历次国际会议决议而奋斗的正义精神，但美英集团则彻底暴露了分裂德国之险毒阴谋。因此使它们处于狼狈不堪的境地。
    美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮策动下的泰国政变，和东京国际法庭检察长美人季南等的公开为日本战犯辩护，是美国在远东扶植原班法西斯势力再起的步骤之一，这种行动必然引起远东各国人民的警惕与反对。（新华社）
