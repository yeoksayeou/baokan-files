    Guan County Committee Decides
    to Strengthen Leadership of Winter Production
    [Our newspaper, Jinan, 21st dispatch] The Guan County Committee specifically convened a joint meeting of responsible cadres and propaganda committee members from each district on the 6th of this month to convey the county committee's preliminary opinions on winter work. The main content is as follows: 1. Lead the peasants to engage in sideline production to increase the production enthusiasm of the masses, improve their awareness, and enhance their confidence in victory. A. Strengthen leadership on production concepts: Past experience can prove the role of leadership. For example, in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, thanks to the leadership, more than 40,000 mu were planted than last year. Huaimuyuan completed wheat planting four or five days earlier. Poor peasants reflected: "The higher-ups lead us to organize mutual aid. Not only did we plant more wheat, but we planted it earlier. We really benefit from it." Especially for poor peasants with little land, little grain harvested, and little capital for business, they face more difficulties. We need to lead them in sideline production. Various ideological obstacles must be completely broken down. Educate poor peasants to become the backbone in the great production movement. B. General leadership, key support, universal call to organize sideline production, oppose sitting and eating, eating away one's capital, and extravagant eating and drinking, and implement frugality. Agricultural loans should resolutely support poor peasants. County and district cadres should go deep into the poor peasant masses, investigate and visit the situation and difficulties of poor peasants, organize poor peasant loan groups, evaluate loan households, and focus on issuing 24 million yuan in sideline production loans. C. Production content: Various small merchants, transportation, oil pressing, flour milling, cotton ginning, salt leaching, saltpeter boiling, textile, etc. 2. Through carrying out the winter study movement, ensure the completion of the central tasks. A. First, leadership should clarify in their minds that education work serves the central tasks, correct the past tendency of neglecting and ignoring education work, strengthen and reorganize leadership organizations at all levels, and strengthen their responsibilities. B. Widely carry out the winter study movement. Except for those who have been struggled against, everyone should be mobilized to enroll. The main target of education this winter is poor peasants, carrying out education on emancipation, production, and current affairs, and vigorously promoting blackboard newspapers and loudspeakers. C. The educational methods and teaching materials should adopt the "little teacher" system. Students should learn in groups and units, learn in a decentralized manner, take regular collective tests, learn what is needed, and the masses can self-compile, self-study, and educate themselves. D. Regarding the issue of teachers, cadres of the education committee (of poor peasant background) will serve.
