(This report from Jilu Yu on the 10th) In the Longhai Railway sabotage battle, the local armed forces and local work teams of the Fifth Sub-district entered the vast new area west from Lanfeng and Kaocheng, and east to Shangqiu and Yucheng, leading the masses in more than 450 villages to liberate themselves, and launched a vigorous movement for the distribution of grain and property. On November 8th, our local armed forces and local work teams entered the new area. During the intervals between battles, they studied documents and carried out ideological education to oppose the "grabbing a handful" mentality toward the new area, strictly implementing the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." At the same time, they conducted widespread propaganda, writing slogans and drawing cartoons everywhere, combining collective propaganda with separate enlightenment. Following this, they suppressed the most heinous landlords and resolutely supported the masses, dispelling their concerns. After that, the majority of poor peasants boldly took action. The masses in Lizhuangzhai would look out at the edge of the village after breakfast or lunch every day, and when they saw comrades from the work team, they would automatically gather and demand the distribution of grain. In ten days, comrades from the work team led the masses in more than 450 villages, including Lizhuangzhai, Jiangzhuang, and Tangzhuang, to reclaim their grain, clothing, and other movable property from the landlords. After the masses divided the fruits of their labor, their class consciousness greatly increased, and they reported more than 200 hidden guns belonging to landlords and secret agents, and discovered local tyrant ringleader Liu Zhenjiang and many members of the "Homecoming Corps". The masses organized themselves more automatically. An old man in Yangdiping Village said: "Today is not the same as yesterday. Yesterday, Zhang Shengtai's soldiers wanted to take away my cow. I wouldn't let them lead it away, so they beat me up. The bastard also wanted to take off my pot, I wouldn't let him take it, I kowtowed to him and he kicked me to the ground, and I couldn't even get up! Today, I got grain and clothes!" Finally, he firmly stated: "If those guys - Zhang Shengtai, the 'Security Brigade' and the landlords dare to bully me again, I'll fight them with a dung fork!" Now, the masses in the new area have established some poor peasant groups to persist in opening up this new area.

(This report from Jilu Yu on the 10th) Our local corps on the Longhai Railway captured more than a hundred enemy officers below the rank of colonel and three cars. At noon on November 26th, a unit of our local corps, which was active on the north side of the Longhai Railway, ambushed enemy vehicles traveling from Xuzhou to Shangqiu at Nannaimiao, more than ten miles west of Huangkou (under the jurisdiction of Xiaoxian). The battle was resolved in just one minute. Two enemy officers of the rank of colonel, Shi Kezheng and Lou Changchun, along with their attendants and drivers, totaling thirty-one people, as well as three new American-made large trucks, were captured by us at the same time. In addition, nearly a hundred fleeing landlords were also captured alive. A complete radio station and two short guns were also seized. On the same day, another unit of our local armed forces swept away the puppet "Homecoming Corps" north of the Longhai Railway, destroying one puppet district headquarters and one puppet township office in Tangzhai, capturing more than thirty enemies and seizing more than twenty rifles. The next day, an enemy battalion of the 70th Division and about a thousand puppet "Homecoming Corps" from Fengxian were dispatched, but were repelled by us, killing more than twenty enemies, while we suffered no casualties.

    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】五分区地方武装及地方工作队，在陇海路破击战中，进入西起兰封、考城，东到商邱、虞城广大新区，领导四百五十余村群众翻身，掀起了广大群众如火如荼的分粮分财运动。十一月八日，我地方武装及地方工作队进至新区，在战争空隙中，一面学习文件进行思想教育，反对对新区有“抓一把”观点，严格执行“三大纪律八项注意”；一面普遍进行宣传，到处写标语画漫画，集体宣传和分别启发配合，紧接着镇压罪大恶极地主，坚决为群众撑腰，解除群众顾虑，此后大多数贫苦农民即大胆行动起来。李庄砦群众每天早饭或午饭后，便在村边上了望，一见工作队同志便自动集合，要求分粮。十天中，工作队同志领导李庄砦、姜庄、唐庄等四百五十余村庄群众，向地主夺回自己的粮食、衣服等浮财。群众分果实后，阶级觉悟大大提高，报出了二百多支地主特务隐蔽的枪支，查出土顽头子刘振江及“还乡团”多名；群众多自动组织起来。杨堤坪村一个老大爷说：“今天和昨天就不是一个天下了，昨天张盛泰的兵要带走我的牛，我不叫牵，把我打了一顿。龟孙又要揭俺的锅，我不叫揭，我给他磕头把我一脚踢倒在地下，爬也爬不起来！今天却分得了粮食和衣服！”最后，他坚决表示：“那些家伙——张盛泰、‘保安旅’和地主再敢欺负俺，我掂粪枚子也得拼！”现在新区群众已纷纷建立了部分贫农小组，为坚持开辟这块新区而斗争。
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】陇海线我地方兵团俘敌校官以下匪伪百余，缴汽车三辆。十一月二十六日下午我活动于陇海路北侧之地方兵团某部，于黄口（萧县属）以西十余里之奶奶庙，伏击由徐州去商邱之敌汽车，只一分钟即解决战斗，敌史可正、娄常春等两个校级军官以下随从汽车夫等共三十一人，连同三辆新式美制大卡车，同时为我俘获。并有近百个逃亡地主，亦被我生擒。并缴获完好之电台一部，短枪两枝。同日，我另部地方武装扫荡陇海路北之伪“还乡团”，解决唐砦伪区部及伪乡公所各一，俘敌三十余人，缴步枪二十余枝。翌日，丰县之敌七十师一个营及伪“还乡团”约千余人出动，当被我击退，毙敌二十余人，我无一伤亡。
