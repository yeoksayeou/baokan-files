　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Reports from various sources indicate that the crisis of national industries in the Chiang-controlled areas has further developed under the dumping of American goods, runaway inflation, and the devastation of bureaucratic capital. In Tianjin, the industrial center of North China, 90 percent of the industry has collapsed. According to statistics cited by the Tianjin Business Daily on November 11th and 12th, out of more than 5,000 factories of all sizes in the city, only 1 percent are operating at full capacity, 4 percent are operating partially but regularly, 40 percent of the factories have ceased operations, and the remaining 55 percent are in a state of semi-shutdown (referring to partial operation, but intermittently). The total production and sales volume of Tianjin's industry is at most one-tenth of the production and sales volume when operating at full capacity. The Yongli Chemical Plant in Tanggu, the only alkali-producing factory in the Chiang-controlled area (referred to as the luckiest factory), now produces only 80 to 90 tons per day, less than one-third of its pre-war output. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on November 20th, the cotton weaving industry in the Chiang-controlled area has gone bankrupt. There are approximately 120,000 power looms in the entire Chiang-controlled area, but only 800 are actually in operation, producing approximately 40 million bolts of 40-yard cloth per year. When Weng Wenhao, director of the Chiang Kai-shek's Resources Committee, reported to the puppet "Political Participation Council" on the 5th of this month regarding the heavy industrial production in the Chiang-controlled area, he also admitted: "Steel, coal, and electricity production are about 50 percent lower than before the war." In addition, due to the influx of American cigarettes and the heavy taxes imposed by the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, each case of cigarettes from Hankou's tobacco factories is losing an average of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Since October 5th, more than two-thirds of the tobacco factories have automatically stopped operating night shifts and reduced production. Under the dumping of American and Japanese woolen goods, the Guangda, Xinhua, and other enterprises companies in Shaanxi's wool textile industry, which have a slight foundation, have been unable to sustain themselves and have closed down one after another. Currently, only the Northwest Wool Textile Factory, a bureaucratic capital enterprise, remains, and it is also shrinking in scale. The branch factories in Jingyang and Tianshui were closed down after the victory against Japan. The factory's only workshop outside the North Gate of Xi'an now produces only 280-odd pounds of yarn per day.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. United Press reported from Shanghai on the 3rd and 4th that 16 silver shop workers in Shanghai have been on hunger strike since the 3rd, demanding appropriate severance pay. It is reported that 50 percent of the silver shop workers in the city have been laid off and are in a dire situation of hunger and unemployment. At the same time, a very large-scale year-end labor strike has begun to emerge. Shop assistants in Shanghai are also demanding a "bonus" equivalent to four months' salary in order to get through the upcoming year-end.

　　美蒋摧残下民族工业垂危
  　蒋区棉织业完全破产沪大规模年关工潮开始到来
    【新华社陕北七日电】据各方报导：蒋管区民族工业在美货倾销、恶性通货膨胀与官僚资本之摧残下，危机已进一步发展。华北工业中心之天津工业百分之九十已陷于崩溃，据天津商务日报上月十一日至十二日所引统计数字：全市共有大小工厂五千余家，经常保持全部开工的仅占百分之一，局部而经常开工的占百分之四，百分之四十的工厂已陷入停工状态；其余百分之五十五的工厂则均处于半停工状态（指局部开工，但时开时停）中。津市工业全部产销数，最多也不过等于全部开工时产销量的十分之一。蒋区唯一制碱工厂塘沽永利化学厂（被称为最幸运的工厂），现日产仅八、九十吨，不足战前产量三分之一。又据中央社十一月二十日电讯：蒋区棉织业已陷破产，全蒋管区机器织布机约为十二万台，而实际运转者则仅有八百台，年产四十码机布约四千万匹。蒋匪资委会主任翁文灏于本月五日向御用“参政会”报告论及蒋区重工业生产时亦供认：“钢煤与电力生产约较战前低百分之五十。”另息：汉口各烟厂因美烟充斥，蒋匪当局捐税苛重，每箱烟平均亏蚀五、六十万元之巨，十月五日起已有三分之二以上的烟厂自动停开夜工，减少生产。陕西毛纺织业稍有基础之广大、新华等企业公司在美、日毛织品倾销下均已不堪支撑，先后倒闭。现仅存官僚资本之西北毛纺织厂一家，亦在缩小范围中，原在泾阳、天山两处分厂早于抗战胜利后即已倒闭，该厂仅有之西安北关外之工场，现日产毛线仅为二百八十余磅。
    【新华社陕北六日电】合众社三、四日沪讯：上海三日起，已有十六家银楼业工人举行绝食，要求给予适当之解雇金。据息：现全市银楼业工人已有百分之五十被解雇，而陷入饥饿失业之惨境。与此同时，规模极大之年关工潮亦已初露头角，上海全市商店店员亦要求给予等于四个月工资的“花红”，以渡过即将到来的年关。
