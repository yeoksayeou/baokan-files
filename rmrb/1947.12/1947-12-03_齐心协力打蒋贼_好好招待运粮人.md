【Report from Shahe】For this anti-offensive grain transport, before the civilian laborers from Anyang County arrived, the masses in villages such as Dongxi Cui and Dadilianzhen had already made thorough preparations for their reception. Men, women, and children in each village were busy clearing houses, preparing beds, cooking dishes, grinding cornmeal, and steaming cornbread. The poor and hired laborers were especially busy, often forgetting to eat. Li Daoshi from Xicui said, "This is a once-in-a-thousand-year event; what's the big deal about skipping a couple of meals?" Zhang Wenchao said, "We're sending food to our own brothers; why wouldn't we be happy?" When Zhang Yannang steamed cornbread, she added some dates. Zhi, a poor hired laborer and family member of a soldier from Dongcui Village, was the first to clear out a room for the civilian laborers, automatically providing a quilt. Women and children in Cao Village ground cornmeal through the night and released their livestock to water the frozen wheat fields. The masses in each village were as busy as if they were celebrating the New Year and receiving relatives. As soon as the civilian laborers entered the village, they were warmly welcomed. Young men carried cloth bags, women boiled water and cooked, young boys led animals and carried water. As soon as the bags were put down, young girls inspected and mended them, leading the civilian laborers to meals... Everyone was busy. Zhang Caizhi and Guo Xiuyun from Xicui, among others, didn't feel the cold despite their hands being frozen all day, mending eighty-five cloth bags in one day. After the civilian laborers arrived, Zhao Yong, a labor hero from Dadilianzhen, was constantly running around the streets, thirteen or fourteen times. Zhang Shuanniang, afraid that the civilian laborers would eat cold food outside and feel unwell, kindly invited them to eat at her home. The civilian laborers unanimously said with gratitude: "The reception is so good, we'd be willing to deliver to Shimen again." (Gao Meng, Zheng Min)
【Report from Wu'an】The Chengguan District of Wu'an warmly welcomes grain-transporting civilian laborers. Each street organized reception stations, with street cadres and the masses taking turns receiving passing civilian laborers. Yang Qianjin, a woman from the Twelfth Street, had four civilian laborers staying at her home on the 27th. She treated them as if they were her own family, first cleaning the house, then spreading felt mats, and pouring boiled water for the civilian laborers. Li Jifang, a member of the People's Association, gave his heated room to the civilian laborers and moved himself to the kitchen. Li San, a civilian laborer, was moved and said, "If we don't complete the task, we'll really let down our fellow villagers." Wang Yuying, the women's captain of the Eleventh Street, continued to receive guests for more than a day without changing shifts, and also mobilized two old ladies to sell bowls of cabbage and yellow steamed buns at the entrance of the station without making a profit. The Xinhua Pool Bathhouse offered free baths to passing civilian laborers. Zhang Baoqing and Dong Yuji from the Third Street voluntarily reduced the price of their fifty-yuan pancakes and steamed buns by ten yuan for the civilian laborers. Under their influence, Nan Guan Lixing and Yuxin Pickled Vegetable Gardens both reduced the price of their two-hundred-yuan-per-jin high-quality pickles by sixty yuan for passing civilian laborers. The young children of the Eleventh Street organized a reception group, a communications group, a firewood collecting group, and a water boiling group, all actively participating in the reception.
