    [This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 3rd dispatch] Qibin County held a ten thousand people rally to celebrate the war support model workers of the past four months and the victory in persisting in guerrilla warfare for more than a year. The rally opened on November 2nd, with a music band leading the procession of heroes. Here were old men with grey beards, children of eleven or twelve, young women, and old ladies in their sixties. Cartoons were posted around the meeting place, one depicting Zhao Lao Han crossing water, and another depicting Zheng Lao Tai protecting the wounded, with large crowds surrounding each one. A large yellow ox was led to the meeting place, which was awarded to the top model worker. The meeting began, and the top model worker Zhao Dianming Lao Han and the "Model Family" Zheng Lao Tai were invited to the stage. In his speech, County Head Yang pointed out that the ability to complete arduous war support tasks during the guerrilla war relied on the people of the entire county. Next, the list of heroes was announced, model deeds were introduced, and awards were given. Special-class model Zhao Dianming Lao Han received a large ox. This white-bearded old man had carried wounded soldiers through fifteen miles of muddy water. A total of fifty-two other model workers were awarded iron shovels, wheelbarrows, towels, and other items.
    Another message: After the Qibin Model Hero Conference, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. Daoping District received an emergency notice on the 16th night, requiring 150 stretchers from the entire district. The notice was given to the villages at 7 pm, and stretchers were made that night. The next day, the entire district assembled 150 stretchers in less than three hours.
