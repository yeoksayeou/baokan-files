    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: TASS Moscow reports: Due to the increasing anti-Soviet actions of the French government, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev, on behalf of the government, presented a note to the French Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Chabannel, on December 9th, instructing him to forward it to the French government. The note stated: The French government's unilateral cancellation of the Franco-Soviet repatriation agreement of June 29, 1945, and its malicious defamation of the members of the Soviet repatriation delegation as "conducting sabotage activities against France," are intended to justify France's various tyrannical anti-Soviet actions and to deceive French public opinion about the true situation in France. The Soviet government considers this action by the French government to be hostile and contrary to the spirit of the Soviet-French Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the consequences of which should be borne by the French side. The Soviet government has ordered all members of the Soviet repatriation delegation to leave France and has demanded that members of the French repatriation delegation in the Soviet Union immediately withdraw from the Soviet Union. Secondly, in view of France's hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union, the Soviet government has decided to cease trade negotiations with France.

    法国政府日益狂妄反苏
    苏照会法停止贸易谈判
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：由于法国政府之反苏行动日益增加，苏联副外长古塞夫奉政府之命，于十二月九日向法驻苏代办夏本迪提出照会，要他转交法国政府。照会略称：法国政府片面取消一九四五年六月廿九日的法苏撤侨协定，并恶意诽谤苏撤侨代表团团员“进行反对法国的破坏活动”，目的在于为法国各种横暴反苏行动辩护，并在于欺骗法国与论关于法国的真实现状。苏政府认为法国政府此种行动是敌视性的，并违背苏法同盟互助条约的精神，其后果应由法方负责。苏联政府已令苏撤侨代表团全体团员离开法国，并且要求苏境法国撤侨代表团团员立即撤离苏联。其次，鉴于法国对苏采取敌视态度，苏联政府决定停止与法国进行贸易谈判。
