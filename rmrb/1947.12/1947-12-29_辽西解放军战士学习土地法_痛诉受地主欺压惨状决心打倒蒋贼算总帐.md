　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army on the Liaoxi front, during breaks in fighting, is studying the Outline Land Law, launching a movement to speak out about suffering, dig up the roots of poverty, and settle accounts with Chiang Kai-shek, spurring them on to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service. When the Third Company of a certain unit held a discussion, veteran soldiers introduced their experiences of turning over and dividing the land, while liberated soldiers recounted their tragic family histories and the various forms of suffering they endured under Chiang Kai-shek's oppression. A soldier who had been liberated from Chiang's 49th Army said: "I am from Youxi, Fujian. My family has nothing. We rented land from the landlord. After harvesting 4,000 catties of grain, we had to pay 2,500 catties in rent. Because we couldn't repay the debt, the landlord used my eight-year-old younger brother as rent. Because we couldn't pay the house rent, they dragged my older sister away to be used as rent. When Chiang Kai-shek conscripted soldiers, the landlords and Baojia chiefs didn't provide people from their own families, but forced poor people to go. The first time, they took my older brother. The second time, they took me and my younger brother." When he realized that the landlord's backing was Chiang Kai-shek, he said indignantly: "Only by overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek can we get revenge!" Zhu Shen, a new soldier from Baodi, recalled that when the 21st Division of Chiang's bandits invaded the area this spring, the landlords frantically tried to reverse the land reforms, seizing the fruits and land of the emancipated peasants. He firmly said: "If Chiang Kai-shek is not overthrown, the land we have divided is not secure." After the discussion, everyone's class hatred was aroused, and they all formulated plans to kill the enemy. At a grievance meeting of the Third Company of a certain unit, the entire company wept bitterly when they spoke of their suffering. Soldier Cui Zhenying said that when he was seven or eight years old, he borrowed ten yuan from the landlord Yang Baochang to bury his grandfather. The next year, the interest compounded to one hundred and twenty yuan, causing his father to die of anger and forcing him and his mother to beg in the streets. He cried so hard that he could not speak. Dong Xue, from the Second Platoon of the Ninth Company, created a short play in which he depicted how, when he was poor, no one wanted to buy his younger brother even for a斗 (dǒu - a unit of dry measure) of rice, forcing him to work for the landlord for a year. Once, he ate five catties of cornmeal from the landlord, and the landlord deducted two months' wages. He used this story to educate everyone. When the play was performed at the regimental and battalion meetings, many people in the audience cried. This made everyone realize that the suffering of the poor was all caused by the landlords and Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate the feudal landlord class and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. The Fifth Company wrote to the regimental leaders, saying: "We hope that you will give us heavier and more arduous tasks, and strive to quickly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's army, avenge our dead elders, and eliminate harm for the broad masses of working people." After the grievance meeting, the unit held a public memorial service for the families of the soldiers who had been oppressed and killed by the landlords, and solemnly swore an oath: "Resolutely overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, avenge the dead, and eliminate harm for the living!"

　  辽西解放军战士学习土地法
  　痛诉受地主欺压惨状决心打倒蒋贼算总帐
    【新华社东北二十三日电】辽西前线解放军在战斗间隙中学习土地法大纲,掀起诉苦挖穷根、向蒋贼算总帐的杀敌立功运动。某部三连举行座谈时，老战士介绍自己翻身分地的经过，解放战士则历述自己的悲惨家世，以及受蒋贼奴役的种种痛苦。一个自蒋匪四十九军解放过来的战士说：“我是福建尤溪人，家里啥也没有，租地主的地种，打四千斤谷子，要交租二千五百斤，因为还不起债，地主把八岁的弟弟顶了租子；交不上房租，又把姐姐拉去顶了。蒋介石抓丁，地主、保甲长不出人，逼着穷人去，第一次把哥哥抓去，第二次又把我和弟弟抓走”。当他觉悟到地主的靠山就是蒋贼时，激愤的说：“只有打倒蒋介石才能报仇！”宝坻新战士朱深回忆今年春天分地时，蒋匪二十一师进犯该区，地主疯狂向翻身农民倒算，夺去了翻身农民的果实和田地，他坚决的说：“不打倒蒋介石，分了地也不保险”。座谈后，激起了大家的阶级仇恨，均纷纷订杀敌计划。某部三连在诉苦大会上，诉到苦处，全连痛哭。战士崔振英说到自己七、八岁时，因为埋葬爷爷借了地主杨保长十块钱，第二年就利滚利变成本利一百二十元，气死了父亲，逼得他和母亲沿街要饭；伤心的哭得说不出话来。九连二班董学并编出一个短剧，将自己贫穷时将弟弟变卖一斗米还没有人要，逼得他给地主受了一年苦。一次吃了地主五斤包米麦，就给地主扣了两个月的工钱的事，拿来教育大家。当该剧在全团和全营大会上出演时，看戏的人很多都哭了。使大家认识到穷人的苦处都是地主蒋介石给的，因此要消灭封建地主阶级，打倒蒋介石。五连给团首长写信说：“希望给我们更重更艰巨的任务，争取迅速消灭蒋介石的军队，为死去的父老复仇，为广大劳苦人民除害”。该部于诉苦后，对过去被地主压迫而死的战士家族举行公祭追悼，并一致隆重宣誓：“坚决打倒蒋介石，为死者复仇，为生者除害！”
