　　Anyang Six Thousand Soldiers and Civilians Form Powerful Demolition Corps to Advance into Border Areas and Carry Out Major Sabotage

    [Our Newspaper, Taihang, 7th dispatch] The Anyang ten thousand landmine explosion campaign has been launched vigorously. On the night of the 14th of last month, soldiers and civilians in the county organized demolition corps and sabotage teams of more than six thousand people to advance into the border areas to carry out comprehensive sabotage and mine-laying. From Liyuan (south of the city) in the south to Liangmagang (north of the city) in the north, landmines were laid everywhere along the sixty-five-mile road. The sounds of gunfire, explosions, and sabotage were incessant throughout the night. The Chiang bandits in each stronghold and in the city were terrified and cowered in a ball upon hearing the sounds. A platoon of Chiang bandits in Weijiaying retreated in disarray from their sentry post at Shangxia Mao Yijian. Afterwards, the bandits forcibly conscripted civilians, digging a very deep trench from Weijiaying through Wangdu, bypassing the airport, through Da and Xiao Si Kong, to Xiao Huayuan, forming an arc-shaped defensive line, and repaired the old trenches to prevent our explosions. They also pulled all the grain and grass outside the city into the city for defense, and conducted a census, implementing martial law, and have already detained more than four thousand people. There is widespread panic inside and outside the city. Landmines are also widely laid in villages in the border areas, exploding at invading Chiang bandits. On the 23rd of last month, the Anyang bandits concentrated their forces to invade Qugouji, but were driven back by mines, injuring five enemies. On the 26th, more than fifty members of the Jiao Shao Village puppet "township office" went to Da and Xiao Po to plunder grain, and two more were killed or injured by explosions. The two invasions yielded nothing, only some radish leaves and tables and chairs (used as coal for burning) were looted. In order to further starve the Chiang bandits to death, the masses also thoroughly carried out the scorched earth policy on radish leaves and other sundries.

　　安阳六千军民组强大爆炸团
    挺进边地举行大破击
    【本报太行七日电】安阳十万个地雷爆炸运动，已猛烈展开。该县军民于上月十四日夜，组织了数达六千余人的爆炸团、破击队，挺进边沿区举行全面破击、埋雷。南起梨园（城南），北至亮马冈（城北），长达六十五里之道上，遍埋地雷。枪声、雷声、破击声，彻夜不绝，各据点及城内蒋匪闻声惊惶万状，缩做一团，魏家营蒋匪在上下毛义涧的一个排哨狼狈撤回。事后匪大抓民夫，从魏家营经王杜，绕过飞机场，经大小四孔到小花园，挖了一条很深的长沟，形成弧形防御线，并补修旧沟，以防我爆炸。并将城外粮草全拉进城内做守城之用，并清查户口，实行戒严，已扣起四千余人。城内外惶惶不安。边沿区各村亦普遍埋设地雷，爆炸出犯蒋匪。上月二十三日，安阳匪集中兵力，进犯曲沟集，被雷炸退，伤敌五人。二十六日，焦邵村伪“乡公所”五十余到大小坡抢粮，又被炸死伤二人。两次出犯毫无所获，仅抢得些萝卜叶，桌椅（当煤烧）等。群众为进一步困死蒋匪，将萝卜叶等杂物亦进行彻底空室清野。
