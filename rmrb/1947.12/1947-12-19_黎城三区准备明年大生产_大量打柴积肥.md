    Licheng Third District Prepares for Large-Scale Production Next Year
    Extensive Firewood Gathering and Manure Accumulation
    [Report from this newspaper in Licheng] In order to help poor peasants and hired laborers overcome difficulties and lay the foundation for next year's production campaign, the Third District has paid attention to organizing the masses (mainly poor peasants and hired laborers) to accumulate manure and gather firewood during the winter production campaign. Since the end of the rent reduction campaign, the district has accumulated a total of 424,653 loads of manure (half of which was accumulated by poor peasants and hired laborers), which, at 30 loads of manure per mu, can solve the fertilizer problem for 14,155 mu of land. The main method of manure accumulation is composting. Along the main roads, villages organized bedding in inns and pigsties. Villages with sheep first organized sheep flocks to bed down on the land of poor military dependents and martyrs' families to solve their fertilizer difficulties. Secondly, they organized elderly people and children to collect manure. Liu Haifa, an old hired laborer in Dongyangguan in his sixties, gets up early and stays out late every day to collect manure on the road. In one month, he collected more than 120 loads. In addition to solving his fertilizer needs for the autumn fields next spring, he will also sell fertilizer. In addition, during the winter production campaign, villages organized 42 firewood cutting teams, cutting a total of 428,766 jin of firewood. On the 5th of this month, Changning organized 140 full and semi-laborers, who cut 9,450 jin in one day. At the market price of 10 yuan per jin, this can be sold for 94,500 yuan, enough to buy 2 shi and 7 dou of millet. Jia Pang, a poor peasant in Nanzaigou Lane, Dongyangguan, led ten elderly people and children to cut firewood, gathering more than 1,800 jin in three days. The Dongshangou base area organized more than 200 disaster-stricken poor peasants and hired laborers to cut firewood in the mountains. Each person can cut more than 300 jin per day (without transporting it back). In one day, they can cut more than 60,000 jin. In four days, including transportation back, they cut a total of 93,100 jin. At present, in addition to organizing the masses to carry out transportation, workshops, and various small-scale cooperatives, the remaining labor force is largely organized to gather firewood and accumulate manure.
