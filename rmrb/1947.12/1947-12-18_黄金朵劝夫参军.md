Golden Flower Persuades Husband to Join the Army
At a county-level conference, Zhu Lou's women's association chairperson, Golden Flower, signed up to send her husband to join the army and proposed a competition with Su Xiuxian, Hao Aiju, and Li Xianglian to see who could mobilize their husbands to join the army first. Golden Flower confidently said, "My husband is a militiaman; mobilizing him to join the army won't be a problem." As a result, the husbands of Su Xiuxian, Hao Aiju, and Li Xianglian smoothly joined the army, but Golden Flower couldn't get through to her husband, Li Jinjv. Golden Flower was furious and resolved to resolutely mobilize him to join the army. The first night, she said to him, "I signed you up in the county." Li Jinjv didn't say a word. "The army models who join the army are so glorious with red ribbons and flowers. Let's both go. If I don't pass the physical, I'll stay home and take care of our father and look after our sister." Golden Flower spent half the night, but she couldn't get through to her husband. The next night, Golden Flower felt increasingly sad: those who didn't sign up at the meeting have already mobilized their husbands to go; we're really losing face! Later, she started crying sadly, and then she thought: crying alone isn't the solution; I might as well wake him up and persuade him again. After her husband woke up, he asked her, "Why are you crying?" Golden Flower cried and said, "Why don't you join the army?!" Li Jinjv was moved and softened, and he asked Golden Flower in return, "Is joining the army good? Is staying at home good? Look at how old our father is!" Seeing that his mind was wavering, Golden Flower immediately persuaded him, "Before, we only had five acres of land, and we couldn't even make ends meet. This year, we have land and are even helping others feed cattle. If old Chiang isn't defeated, our rice bowls won't be secure. I think it's better to join the army and become an army model." On the third day, Jinjv said, "It's okay for me to join the army, but I don't have any clothes to wear, and there's no one to do the work at home." Golden Flower said, "Don't worry, someone will fetch water for us, and I can do all the work. We'll buy some cloth to make you shoes, and my mother's woven cloth will make you cotton pants." At this time, Li Jinv gradually understood. In the afternoon, he signed up at the mass meeting, but Li Jinv's heart was still a little unhappy. Golden Flower was very happy. When Jinv didn't eat, she said, "Just the two of us are together, how can I eat if you don't eat? I'll answer whatever you ask. If you don't have clothes to wear, I'll make them for you; if I didn't take good care of our father before, I'll take good care of him in the future. We'll separate now and then reunite later. I'll agree to whatever you say. Can't you, a man, beat a woman? Why are you always frowning?" This passage touched her husband's heart, and Li Jinv's thoughts were completely straightened out. At the farmers' meeting, the couple happily walked hand in hand onto the army recruitment stage, winning the glorious title of army recruitment model for Zhu Lou.

    黄金朵劝夫参军
    朱楼妇会长黄金朵，在县里开大会时，就报名送郎参军，并提出和苏秀贤、郝爱菊、李香莲比赛，看谁先动员丈夫参军去。黄金朵很有信心的说：“俺丈夫是个民兵，动员他参军不成问题。”结果苏秀贤、郝爱菊、李香莲的丈夫，顺当的参军了，但是黄金朵的丈夫李金聚，却打不通思想。黄金朵气的呼呼的，她下了决心坚决动员他参军。第一天夜里她向他说：“我在县里给你报上名啦。”李金聚听了不吭气。“人家那参军模范披红戴花多光荣，咱俩都去吧，要是验不上我，我就在家侍候咱爷，照顾咱妹妹。”黄金朵费了半夜的工夫，也没打通她丈夫的思想。到第二天晚上，黄金朵越想越难过：人家在会场上没报名的，都动员去了，咱真丢脸呀！后来难过的哭起来，又想：光哭也不是办法，不如把他叫醒，再劝劝。丈夫醒后，问她：“你哭啥呀？”金朵哭着说着：“你为啥不参军？！”李金聚被感动的心软了，他反问金朵说：“参军好呀？在家好呀？你看咱爷岁数这么大！”金朵见他的心眼活动了，紧接着劝他说：“以先咱只五亩地，使帐揭窟窿也顾不住，今年咱有了地，还跟人家伙喂个牛，老蒋打不倒饭碗不牢靠，我看不胜参军当个参军模范好。”第三天，金聚说：“我参军是中，就是没衣裳穿，家里活没人做。”金朵说：“你请放心啦，有人给咱打水，啥活我都能做，咱买的布给你做对鞋，俺娘织的布给你做个棉裤。”这时，李金聚慢慢的想通了，到下午就在群众大会上报了名，但李金聚的心多少还有点不痛快，黄金朵却高兴的很，金聚不吃饭，她说：“就咱俩口过，你不吃饭叫我怎吃？你要求啥俺答复啥。没衣裳穿给你做衣裳；以前侍候咱爷不好，以后好好的，分开啦再合锅，你说啥应啥，难道你这个男子汉还不胜俺妇女吗？为啥老愁眉不展呢？”这一段话都说到她丈夫心眼里了，李金聚的思想彻底打通了。在农民大会上，妇夫俩高兴的携手走上参军台，给朱楼争取了送郎参军最光荣的模范称号。
