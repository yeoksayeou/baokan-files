　　Powerful Italian People's Movement
　　Zong Yin
　　I
　　It has been exactly thirty years since the end of the First Imperialist World War. Under the leadership of its vanguard Communist Party, the Italian working people have been waging unremitting struggles for democracy, freedom, progress, and independence. In this great struggle, although the Italian working people have experienced many difficult and tortuous paths, they have never been discouraged. Their strength has always been growing, especially now, at this new historical stage of the struggle. The Italian working people have shown themselves to be an iron force with strong combat effectiveness, and they have sufficient strength to shoulder and complete this new historical task.

　　As early as 1919, the Italian people, in order to overthrow the imperialist rule of their own country, heroically launched an uprising and first established a Soviet regime in Milan. However, because the General Confederation of Labor, which led this movement at the time, did not have the courage and determination to further organize the working class to fight, and at the same time, many leaders of the Socialist Party committed right-wing errors, and even fundamentally betrayed the working class, they ordered the workers to abandon the factories they had occupied in order to seize power. This caused a split in the workers' movement, causing the revolution to fail. This is just as the then-heavy industry organ newspaper said: "The reason why there was no revolution at that time was not because someone wanted to stop it, but because the General Confederation of Labor did not need it." After the failure of the revolution, due to the passive and頹廢mood of the working people, it greatly facilitated the activities of the fascist parties who touted reformism. In less than two years, Mussolini "marched on Rome" in October 1922 and became a dictator. Although the young Italian Communist Party was under the dark fascist terror, it still resolutely led the anti-fascist underground movement and secretly published its own newspaper. The two largest parties of the Italian working class—the Communist Party and the Socialist Party—accepted the past experience and signed a joint agreement in October 1935 to take joint action against fascism, and decided to jointly conduct activities in the fascist trade unions to rebuild the anti-Mussolini people's power. Soon, more and more workers were united to participate in the heroic struggle against fascism, and strength was accumulated for the working class.

　　II
　　Shortly after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the military defeat of Italy's participation in the war against the Soviet Union, as well as the hunger and disasters brought about by the war, forced the people to rise up and resist. The anti-fascist people's movement reached a new climax. In October 1941, the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party jointly formed the National Liberation Committee, leading the Italian people in a wide range of anti-fascist and anti-war movements. In December 1942, the National Liberation Committee held a meeting in Milan and formed a national front with five political parties, including the Christian Democratic Party, the Action Party, and the Liberal Party. At the same time, revolutionary factory committees were first established in various industrial factories in Milan, and then expanded to all cities in northern Italy, which greatly strengthened the struggle against war and fascism. Soon, under the leadership of the National Front and the Factory Committee, the Italian working people launched uprisings in Milan and Turin. The anti-fascist movement swept across Italy, and the fascist rule finally fell at the feet of the people on July 15, 1943. The Badoglio, who succeeded in forming a cabinet, under the pressure of the people and the Allied landing in Italy, had to surrender to the Allied forces on September 8 of the same year.

　　After Italy withdrew from the Axis powers, the Badoglio government continued the fascist rule. It neither changed the state institutions in accordance with democratic principles nor fought against Germany. However, the National Front continued to mobilize the people to struggle for the establishment of democratic politics on the one hand, and led the anti-German war in northern Italy, which was controlled by the Nazi army, on the other hand. By October 1943, hundreds of guerrilla units were active in the Alps and Apennines, and developed to 150,000 people in three months, which increased sharply to 400,000 people by 1944. They fought in the rear of the enemy and established guerrilla bases on the Italian-Swiss and Italian-South borders; at the same time, factory committees were secretly organized in the German military factories in northern Italy controlled by the Nazis. In December, they called on workers in industrial centers such as Turin, Milan, and Genoa to strike and demonstrate to increase food rations to test the enemy's strength. The enemy was forced to agree to the workers' demands, and the first experiment was successful. Then the factory committees organized the basic forces of the resistance movement and established armed anti-fascist squads to prepare for armed struggle. The National Liberation Committee plus the Factory Committee became the ruling force in northern Italy at that time. The workers were completely united, so on March 1, 1944, a ten-day general strike against fascism and Germany was held in all factories in northern and central Italy, which made the enemy feel frightened. The powerful strength of the people in northern Italy and their achievements in the war against Germany forced the British and American Allies and the Badoglio government at that time to recognize this organization. Therefore, on April 21, the Badoglio government was forced to reorganize, and the parties of the National Liberation Committee participated in the cabinet. On June 5, 1944, after the Allied forces captured Rome, Bonomi succeeded in organizing a cabinet including six major parties, ordered the dissolution of fascist parties and trade unions, abolished fascist laws, recognized the contributions of the North Italian National Liberation Committee and guerrillas, and gave the latter equal treatment as regular troops.

　　In January 1945, the North Italian guerrillas began to advance from the mountains to the plains. On the eve of the collapse of the Nazis, the National Liberation Committee called on workers and guerrillas to make a final duel with the enemy, and decided to seize the property of the capitalists who cooperated with the enemy. Worker management production committees were established in the major factories. Their rapid actions prevented the factories in northern Italy from being destroyed by the enemy when they withdrew. At the same time, the North Italian guerrillas successively liberated industrial centers such as Milan and Genoa, and occupied the Italian-Swiss border, which was forty-five miles long. The National Liberation Committee announced the official takeover of all political power in northern Italy, quickly executed Mussolini, and forced one million German troops to surrender to the Allied forces on May 2.

　　III
　　After the fall of Germany, the six major parties agreed on June 21 to form a new government led by Bali, the leader of the Action Party. However, under the coercion of the Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic Party, which represented the interests of large landlords, big bourgeoisie, and financial oligarchs, the Bali cabinet had to resign completely in December, and Gasperi, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, reorganized the new cabinet.

　　After Gasperi came to power, he was frightened by the increasing prestige of the Communist and Socialist parties in the cabinet and the continuous growth of democratic forces. Therefore, he gathered all reactionary forces and openly implemented the reactionary policy of betraying the country, dictatorship, and anti-people, trying to finally save Italy's faltering capitalist rule. At the same time, Gasperi placed all hope for resolving the Italian crisis on American "aid," "treating imaginary funds as gifts from Uncle Sam, so he had to shine his shoes" (Togliatti's words). Encouraged and instigated by a mere empty check of ten billion US dollars from the United States, Gasperi took a suicidal policy on May 13 this year, excluding the Communist and Socialist parties and implementing a one-party dictatorship.

　　However, the result of Gasperi government's implementation of this reactionary policy was to put Italy in a major disaster of economic and political crisis and imperialist enslavement. The huge expenses for the US occupation forces (this expense reached 100 billion lire), the plunder carried out by Britain and the United States using the occupation in Italy, the sluggishness of production and the large amount of imports, the endless inflation and high prices, the fiscal deficit of 300 billion lire, and the extreme shortage of production, especially food and coal, all this has led the entire economy to the brink of bankruptcy. On the one hand, Gasperi spared no effort to betray the country and asked the United States to save its major economic crisis. As a result, Italy's aviation industry, oil mines, markets, and other national sovereignty fell into the hands of the United States. A large number of American delegations came one after another to investigate and study everywhere, trying to design to turn Italy into an appendage of American imperialism and an important base for expansion to Europe, Africa, and Asia. On the other hand, Gasperi attacked the Italian people even more fiercely, repeatedly reducing food rations. The current food ration for the Italian people is only 200 grams per day (equivalent to five liang and three qian six). At the same time, he reduced wages and laid off a large number of employees, which caused a serious unemployment situation of 2.5 million people. The Italian people can no longer tolerate the authorities' betrayal of the country, dictatorship, and their own extreme hunger and poverty.

　　A month and a half after Gasperi excluded the Socialist and Communist parties, strikes and demonstrations emerged one after another. On June 29, when Gasperi first attended the Venice Christian Youth Congress and delivered a speech, the local people held a demonstration. Then, in late August, a large-scale strike of more than 2 million people broke out across the country, affecting 800,000 steel industry workers and 1.2 million agricultural workers, which lasted for a month, protesting against the Gasperi government's economic policies and high prices. On September 20, a national demonstration and parade was held against the Gasperi government, demanding that Gasperi step down.

　　IV
　　Now, the Italian working people are fighting to end the forces of neo-fascists headed by Gasperi. The bombing of the Milan Communist Party headquarters broke out the determination of the entire Italian working people to fight for the defense of democracy. From the Po River basin to Sicily, the entire ancient Rome boiled over. The local organizations of the fascist People's Party, the Social Movement Party, and the Christian Democratic Party were destroyed by the roaring people everywhere. Demonstrations and strikes are taking place throughout Italy. In this great movement, the Italian working people (workers and peasants), under the unified and organized leadership of the General Confederation of Labor, demonstrated strong unity and heroic fighting spirit. They resolutely fought back against the armed suppression of the reactionary authorities, smashed the split conspiracy of the Christian Democratic trade unionists, especially the agricultural workers in some areas of the south, and took up rifles, hoes, and all available weapons to fight back against the suppressors, forcing the military police to be in a "vulnerable defense." At the same time, in Milan, Naples, and other places, the strikers more resolutely controlled or even occupied traffic arteries, government agencies, and cities.

　　The unprecedented scale of the Italian working people's struggle this time, and the unity, courage, and heroism they demonstrated in the struggle, mark that a revolutionary situation already exists in Italy. Because the evil consequences caused by the Gasperi reactionary government's resolute policy of betraying the country and dictatorship (the worsening economic crisis, the greater impoverishment of the people, and the great disaster of losing independence, etc.) have made the people reach the point where they cannot continue to live as before; therefore, they can only resolutely unite and carry out a heroic life-and-death struggle. At the same time, it shows that Gasperi's naked betrayal of the country, dictatorship, and anti-people's vicious face have completely lost prestige in front of the people, and he has suffered the deep hatred of the people, making him reach the point where he cannot continue to rule as before. Therefore, although the current nationwide movement has temporarily come to a successful conclusion in form due to the satisfaction of partial economic demands, the successive movements will continue, and will continue to develop until the complete victory of people's democracy. This great nationwide anti-fascist people's movement has victoriously reviewed the combat effectiveness of the working people, and thereby educated the ranks of the working people and their vanguard, in preparation for the future victorious duel. The current period is a transitional period to accelerate the establishment of a new front of broad democratic forces and to win over and unite all democratic forces.

　　The struggle of the Italian working people will surely be victorious, because under the strong leadership of the great Italian Communist Party with 2.2 million members, there is full cooperation from the Socialist Party with 900,000 members, and strong support from millions of organized members of the General Confederation of Labor.

　　强大的意国人民运动
    棕音 　 一
    从第一次帝国主义世界大战结束迄今，已整整三十年了，意大利劳动人民在其先锋队共产党的领导下，始终为民主、自由、进步和独立进行了不懈的斗争。在这一伟大的斗争中，意大利劳动人民虽经历了许多艰难和曲折的道路，但它们从未气馁过，它们的力量始终增长着，特别发展到现在，在这斗争的历史新阶段时，意大利劳动人民已表现为一支具有坚强战斗力的铁的队伍，它们有足够的力量担负并将完成这一历史的新任务。
    远在一九一九年，意大利人民为了推翻本国的帝国主义统治，曾英勇起义并在米兰首先树立了苏维埃政权。但由于当时领导这一运动的劳动总同盟，没有进一步组织工人阶级进行斗争的勇气与决心，同时其中许多社会党领袖犯了右倾，甚至根本背叛了工人阶级，竟命令工人放弃为夺取政权而占领的工厂。因此造成了工人运动的分裂，使革命陷于失败。这正如当时重工业机关报所说：“那时之所以没有革命，不是因为有谁要阻止它，而是因为劳动总同盟不需要它。”革命失败后，由于劳动人民的消极与颓丧情绪，大大便利了以改良主义为标榜的法西斯党徒的活动，于是不出两年，墨索里尼就在一九二二年十月“进军罗马”而做了独裁者。年青的意大利共产党，虽在暗无天日的法西斯恐怖下，但仍坚决领导了反法西斯的地下运动，秘密出版着自己的报纸。意大利两个工人阶级的最大政党——共产党与社会党，更接受了过去的经验，于一九三五年十月签订了采取共同行动反对法西斯的联合协定，并决议共同在法西斯的职工会中活动，借此重建反墨索里尼的人民力量。不久，便团结了越来越多的工人参加到反法西斯英勇的斗争中来，并为工人阶级积蓄了力量。
　　二
    在纳粹侵略苏联不久之后，由于意大利参加对苏作战在军事上的一败涂地，以及战争带来的饥饿及灾难，迫使人民奋起抗争，反法西斯的人民运动又达到了新的高潮。一九四一年十月，意共与社会党合组了民族解放委员会，领导意大利人民进行了广泛的反法西斯和反战运动。四二年十二月民族解放委员会在米兰举行会议，并与基督教民主党、行动党、自由党等五个政党组成了民族阵线。同时，革命的工厂委员会也在米兰各工业工厂内首先建立起来，接着便扩展到北意一切城市，这就大大加强了反战与反法西斯斗争。不久，在民族阵线和工厂委员会领导下，意劳动人民即在米兰和都灵起义，席卷全意的反法西斯运动，使法西斯统治终于在一九四三年七月十五日倒在人民的脚下了。继起组阁的巴多格里奥，在人民的压力下与盟军在意的登陆，不得不于同年九月八日向盟国投降。
    意大利退出轴心后，巴多格里奥政府仍继续着法西斯统治，既未按照民主原则改变国家机构，又未向德作战。但民族阵线一方面为建立民主政治继续动员人民斗争；另一方面领导着当时为纳粹军控制的北意进行反德战争。到四三年十月，阿尔卑斯与亚平宁山脉中已活跃着数百个游击队，在三个月内发展到十五万人，到四四年即激增至四十万人。在敌人的后方进行作战，并在义瑞、义南边境建立了游击队根据地；同时在纳粹控制着的北意之德国军需工厂内，也秘密组织了工厂委员会。十二月他们号召都灵、米兰、热那亚等工业中心的工人，为增加粮食配给而进行罢工和游行示威，以试探敌人的力量，敌人被迫答应了工人的要求，于是第一次的试验成功了。接着各工厂委员会组织了抵抗运动的基本队伍，建立了武装的反法西斯小队，准备进行武装斗争。民族解放委员会再加上工厂委员会成为当时北意的统治力量。工人们完全团结起来了，因此在一九四四年三月一日在北意和中意所有工厂中得以举行了一个反法西斯反德的十天总同盟罢工，而使敌人魂丧魄散。北意人民的强大力量和对德作战的功绩，迫使当时的英美盟国和巴多格里奥政府不能不承认这种组织，因此在四月二十一日，巴多格里奥政府被迫改组，民族解放委员会的各党参加组阁。四四年六月五日盟军攻下罗马后，波诺米继起组织包括六大政党的内阁，下令解散法西斯政党及工会，废除法西斯法律，承认北意民族解放委员会与游击队的贡献，并给予后者以正规军的平等待遇。
    四五年一月，北意游击队开始从山中向平原挺进。在纳粹崩溃的前夜，民族解放委员会号召工人与游击队向敌人作最后一次的决斗，并决定夺取与敌合作的资本家的财产，在各重要工厂内建立了工人管理生产委员会，他们迅速的行动，使北意各工厂免遭敌人撤退时的破坏。同时北意游击队先后解放米兰、热那亚等工业中心，占领了长达四十五英里的义瑞边境。民族解放委员会宣布正式接收意北一切政权，迅速枪决了墨索里尼，并迫使百万德军于五月二日向盟国投降。
　　三
    德国垮台后，于六月二十一日六大政党协议由行动党领袖巴利组织新政府。但在代表大地主、大资产阶级及金融寡头的利益的自由党及基督教民主党的胁迫下，巴利内阁不得不于十二月总辞职，由基督教民主党领袖加斯贝利重组新阁。
    加斯贝利上台后，慑于共社两党在内阁中威信之日增及民主力量的不断增长，于是就纠集一切反动势力，公开实行卖国独裁反人民的反动政策，力图最后拯救意大利摇摇欲坠的资本统治。同时，加斯贝利则将解决意大利危机的一切希望，寄托在美国的“援助”上，“把幻想的款项当作山姆大叔的礼物，因此不得不给他擦鞋子”（托格里亚蒂语）。仅仅在美国十亿美元一纸空头支票的鼓励和嗾使下，加斯贝利就在今年五月十三日，不惜采取了自杀政策，排斥了共、社两党，实行一党独裁。
    但加斯贝利政府实行这种反动政策的结果，却更使意大利处于一个经济、政治危机与帝国主义奴役的大灾难中。用于美占领军的庞大费用，（此项费用达一百亿里拉）英美利用占领在意进行之掠夺，生产之一蹶不振和大量入超，无止境的通货膨胀和物价高涨，三千亿里拉的财政赤字，生产品特别是粮食和煤的奇缺，这一切，已把整个经济引向破产的边缘。加斯贝利一方面不惜卖国要求美国来拯救其经济的大危机，于是意大利的航空业、石油矿、市场等国家主权都落在美国之手，美国的大批代表团接踵而至，到处调查考察，力图设计变意大利为美帝国主义的附庸和向欧、非、亚扩张的重要基地。另一方面，加斯贝利则更凶恶的向意大利人民进攻，一再减低粮食配给，现在意人民每天的粮食配给量仅二百格兰姆（合五两三钱六），同时减低工资并大批裁减职工，因此造成了二百五十万人的严重失业情况。意大利人民对当局的卖国独裁和本身极端饥饿贫困的惨状是再也不能忍受下去了。
    当加斯贝利排斥社共两党一个半月以后，罢工与示威即层出不穷。六月二十九日在加斯贝利初次出席威尼斯基督教青年大会演说时，当地人民即举行了示威。接着八月下旬爆发了全国二百万人以上的大罢工，波及八十万钢铁工业工人，一百二十万农业工人，坚持一月之久，抗议加斯贝利政府经济政策及物价高涨，并在九月二十日举行了反对加斯贝利政府，要求加斯贝利滚下台的全国大示威游行。
　　四
    现在，意大利劳动人民正在为结束以加斯贝利为首的新法西斯分子势力而战斗着。米兰共产党总部的被炸，爆发了全意劳动人民为保卫民主而斗争的决心。从波河流域到西西里，整个古罗马都沸腾起来了。法西斯的平民党、社会运动党、基督教民主党的地方组织在各地被怒吼的人民所捣毁。示威，罢工，在整个意大利进行。在这次大运动中，意大利的劳动人民（工人、农民）在总工会统一与有组织的领导下，表现了坚强的团结和英勇的战斗精神。坚决地反击了反动当局的武装镇压，击破了基督教民主党工贼的分裂阴谋，尤其南部若干地区的农业工人，更拿起步枪、锄头及一切可用之武器回击镇压者，迫使军警处于“脆弱性的防御中”。同时在米兰，那不勒斯等地，罢工者更果敢地控制甚至占领了交通要道、政府机关及城市。
    意大利劳动人民这一次斗争的空前规模，和他们在斗争中所表现的团结果敢和英勇，标志着革命形势在意大利业已存在。因为由于加斯贝利反动政府的坚决卖国独裁政策所招致的恶果（经济危机的更益严重，人民的更益赤贫和丧失独立的大灾难等），已使人民到达不能继续照旧生活下去的时候了；因此他们只有坚决团结起来进行英勇的生死斗争。同时说明加斯贝利赤裸裸的卖国独裁和反人民的凶恶面目，已在人民面前完全丧失了威信，遭受了人民的深恶痛绝，使他到了不能继续照旧统治下去的时候了。因此，目前全国性的运动，虽因局部经济要求之满足而在形式上暂以胜利告一段落，但此起彼伏的运动仍将继续，一直发展到人民民主的彻底胜利。这一次伟大的全国性的反法西斯的人民运动，胜利检阅了劳动人民的战斗力，并借此教育了劳动人民的队伍及其先锋队，以准备未来的胜利决斗。目前就是加速建立广泛民主势力的新阵线，争取和团结一切民主力量的过渡时期。
    意大利劳动人民的斗争，必将取得胜利，因为在有二百二十万党员的伟大的意共的坚强领导下，有着九十万党员的社会党的充分合作，和数百万有组织的总工会会员的有力支持。
