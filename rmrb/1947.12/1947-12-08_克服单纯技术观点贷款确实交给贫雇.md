　　[Taixing News from this Newspaper] The Jinnan Bank First Branch and the Taihang First Special District, based on the good or bad harvests and the severity of disasters in various counties in the area, distributed 50 million yuan in low-interest loans specifically to support the poor and hired laborers in production to overcome the famine. The specific distribution amounts were: 10 million yuan each for Lincheng and Zanhuang counties, and 30 million yuan for Jingxing county. The loan recipients were poor and hired disaster victims, with a focus on areas severely affected by the disaster. In Lincheng, all funds were used in the fourth district; in Zanhuang, all funds were used in the fourth and fifth districts; Jingxing county could independently determine the key areas. The purpose was to closely integrate with winter production, overcoming famine, and disaster relief, such as transportation, textile, and other side occupations, to solve the financial difficulties of the poor and hired disaster victims in production. It should be based on the production conditions of the poor and hired disaster victims and the natural economic conditions of the masses overcoming famine, without fixed uses, boldly giving play to the creativity of the masses, doing whatever is beneficial, and facilitating them to carry out various productions. Overcome the past tendency of specifying uses and combining the use of floating capital of the masses (such as supporting middle peasants to buy livestock), to avoid the phenomenon of the poor and hired laborers not being able to obtain loans. In the future, it is necessary to break this circle. Whether the interest is issued directly by the bank or through cooperative credit departments, it should be a monthly interest of eight li, which is two-thirds lower than the general loan interest, because this is specifically for disaster relief and is different from other loans. In practice, it should cooperate with the government and the production and famine relief committee to jointly study and implement it, organize the poor and hired laborers to carry out production to make up for deficits according to local production conditions. Counties without low-interest loans should conduct investigations, transfers, and adjustments of loans, retain a small number of loans from non-disaster area villages as individual production funds for the poor and hired laborers, and withdraw the majority and concentrate them to lend to the poor and hired laborers in disaster areas for production, so that the loans truly serve the poor and hired disaster victims and play the role of loans.

　　克服单纯技术观点贷款确实交给贫雇
    【本报太行讯】冀南银行一分行与太行一专署，根据该区各县年景好坏，灾情的轻重，分发五千万元低利贷款，专门扶植贫雇生产渡荒。具体分配数目为：临城、赞皇两县各一千万元，井陉三千万元。贷款对象为贫雇灾民，以灾重地区为贷款重点，临城全用于四区，赞皇全用于四、五两区，井陉是全县可自找重点。其用途：要和冬季生产渡荒救灾紧密结合，如运输纺织等副业，解决贫雇灾民生产中的资金困难，应根据贫雇灾民之生产条件与群众渡荒的自然的经济条件，不可固定用途，大胆发挥群众创造，什么有利干什么，便利其进行各种生产。克服过去指定用途，结合群众游资使用（如扶植中农买牲口）的偏向，以免发生贫雇贷不到款的现象，今后一定要打破这个圈子。利息无论银行直接发放或通过合作社信用部发放，一律月息八厘，比一般贷款利息低三分之二，因这是专为救灾，不同其他贷款。在作法上应配合政府及生产渡荒委员会，共同研究进行，根据当地生产条件，组织贫雇进行生产补窟窿。没有低利贷款的县分，进行查贷转贷调剂贷款，将非灾区村的贷款留少数作为个别贫雇生产基金，其次大部抽回集中贷给灾区贫雇生产，使贷款真正服务贫雇灾民，发挥贷款作用。（庞双庆）
