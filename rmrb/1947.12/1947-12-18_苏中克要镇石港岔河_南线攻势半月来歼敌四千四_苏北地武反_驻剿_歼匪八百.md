Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 16th: The Central China Liberation Army successively recovered the key town of Shigang, 50 li northeast of Nantong, and the Jiang bandits' strongholds of Chahe on the Ru (Gao) Jue (Gang) line on the 7th and 8th of this month, the defending enemy fleeing. Since the Central China Liberation Army launched its offensive on the southern front on the night of November 30th, it has successively eliminated eight strongholds: Libao, @cha, Jiaoxie, Dingjiasuo on the Hai (An) @ (Cha) line, Matang, Chahe on the Ru (Gao) Jue (Gang) line, and Shigang, Wuzongbu northeast of Nantong, annihilating a total of more than 4,400 enemies.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: Simultaneously with the Central China Southern Front offensive, the Siyang-Shuyang military and civilians in northern Jiangsu won a complete victory in countering "stationing and suppression," eliminating more than 780 enemies in six days. On November 30th, a part of the Jiang bandits' 51st Division on the Huai (Yang) Si (Yang) line and the Huai (Yang) Shu (Yang) line, colluding with local bandits, totaling more than two regiments, launched a "stationing and suppression" operation in the Sishu area in three routes, vainly attempting to reoccupy the Shuhuai Highway line, which we had recovered in September. The local militia and guerrillas comprehensively obstructed them, fighting and luring them, causing the enemy to gather in the Wangji area between Huai, Shu, and Si. The enemy thought our forces were weak, so they stationed themselves there and wantonly seized more than 2,000 civilians to build the Shuhuai Road. On the morning of the 5th, our Huaihai local armed forces concentrated superior forces and, with the force of thunder, launched a pincer attack in two routes. After a fierce battle for half a day, the enemy, unable to withstand the attack, abandoned their corpses and tried to escape. At that time, our brave cavalry suddenly jumped out of the fields, killing the bandit army in disarray. In this battle, a total of more than 500 enemies were killed or wounded, more than 80 were captured, and 90 rifles were seized. The remnants of the enemy fled south of Wangji, where they were intercepted by our district and township armed forces, and more than 200 bandits were captured. By the afternoon of the 6th, the remnants of the bandits fled back to their original strongholds in a panic. The Shuhuai Highway, from Wulizhuang in the south to Shiziqiao in the north, a distance of more than 100 li, is still under our control.

    【新华社华东前线十六日电】华中解放军于七、八两日相继收复南通东北五十里要镇石港及如（皋）掘（港）线上之岔河两蒋匪据点，守敌逃逸。按华中解放军自上月三十日夜在南线开展攻势以来，已先后拔除海（安）＠（茶）线上之李堡、＠茶、角斜、丁家所、如（皋）掘（港）线上之马塘、岔河及南通东北之石港、五总埠八个据点，共歼敌四千四百余名。
    【新华社华东十六日电】与华中南线攻势同时，苏北泗（阳）沭（阳）军民反“驻剿”获全胜，六天歼敌七百八十余名。上月三十日，淮（阳）泗（阳）线与淮（阳）沭（阳）线蒋匪五十一师一部纠集土顽共两个团以上兵力分三路向泗沭地区进行“驻剿”，妄图重占九月间即为我收复之沭淮公路一线。当地民兵及游击队全面予以阻挠，且战且诱，使敌结集于淮、沭、泗间之王集地区，敌以为我兵力空虚，乃驻扎该地，放肆抓民夫二千余修筑沭淮路。五日晨，我淮海地武集中优势兵力，以迅雷之势，分两路予以夹击，激战半天后，敌不支弃尸欲逃，是时，我神勇骑兵忽自田野间跃出，杀得匪军七零八落，此役共毙伤敌五百余名，俘敌八十余，缴步枪九十支。残敌向王集以南逃遁，又为我区乡武装拦击，俘匪二百余。至六日下午，残匪狼狈窜回原据点。沭淮公路南迄五里庄北至十字桥百余里，仍在我控制中。
