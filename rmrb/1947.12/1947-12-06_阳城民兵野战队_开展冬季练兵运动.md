Yangcheng Militia Field Force
　Launches Winter Training Campaign
　　[Our paper, Taiyue, 4th dispatch] The Yangcheng Militia Field Force is deeply involved in the winter training campaign. The "Night Pearl" Field Company, having just returned from a long expedition in western Henan, has not yet had a good rest, but because they deeply felt the need for training during the expedition, they also joined the training, which began on the 21st of last month. At the launch, when the village celebrated the company's achievements, the "Night Pearl" emphasized the importance of training at the meeting, saying: "We didn't train well in the past, and some comrades, although they had guns, were still fake tigers. In this training, we must study hard, enrich our skills, and turn fake tigers into real tigers." In the organization of their training, they completely used the set of methods from the expedition, such as the military and political mutual aid groups, discipline inspection groups, life and hygiene groups, merit-making committees, cultural and communications committees, and other regular organizations that existed in the company during the expedition. These organizations are not just formal, but also play a significant role in the company. Because there is such a ready-made organization, the training quickly formed a craze. First, they used the poor peasant backbone to carry out the "speak bitterness" movement. In this movement, everyone's class consciousness became clearer, and three bad elements, Chen Xiaoyong, Yang Anhui, and Yuan Xiaoren, were discovered and immediately purged. Training methods: (1) Everyone plans, everyone leads. In order to meet practical needs, the entire training plan is based on the actual situation of each company, raising questions and discussing decisions; (2) Less talk, more action. Cadres first give a simple explanation based on practical experience and basic principles, and then let those who know how to do it. Everyone watches and discusses, corrects shortcomings, and lets everyone repeatedly act according to this example until they understand the essentials. The teaching materials are only used as a reference for cadre guidance, correcting the past methods of cadres teaching rigidly and soldiers learning mechanically; (3) Mutual teaching and mutual learning, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, learning what you don't know. The main subjects in the military aspect are combat drills, and technology is carried out during breaks. In order to enable everyone to learn what they don't know in technology, and to improve what they already know, detailed and specific divisions of labor have been carried out, allowing those who know how to find help objects, ensuring that those who don't know how are taught. Those who don't have help objects then work hard. For example, out of 116 people in the first company, 23 did not know how to throw grenades, and 16 of them did not know how to shoot a gun. Therefore, they were organized into military mutual aid groups to use their afternoon self-study time to help each other, and the rest of the people who knew how also worked hard during this month.

　　阳城民兵野战队
  　开展冬季练兵运动
    【本报太岳四日电】阳城民兵野战队，卷入冬季练兵运动。“夜明珠”野战连，刚从豫西远征归来，尚未很好休整，但他们由于在远征中深感练兵的需要，所以也卷入了练兵，从上月二十一日开训。开训时，适村中为该连贺功，“夜明珠”在大会上强调练兵的重要性说：“咱们过去没有好好练兵，有些同志虽然拿上了枪，可还是个假老虎。在这次练兵中，要好好学习，充实自己的本领，将假老虎变成真老虎。”他们在练兵的组织上，完全是运用远征时现成的一套，如他们在远征时，连队里就有军事、政治互助小组，纪律检查组，生活卫生组，立功委员会，文化通讯委员会等经常的组织。这些组织不光是有形式，而且在连队里起着很大的作用。正因为有这样一套现成的组织，所以练兵很快的形成了热潮。首先，他们以雇贫骨干开展诉苦运动，在这一运动中，大家的阶级观念更明确了，发现了陈小永、杨安惠、原小任等三个坏分子，立刻清洗了他们。练兵方法：（一）大家计划，大家领导。为了切合实际需要，整个的练兵计划都是由各连根据实际情况，提出问题，大家讨论决定的；（二）少讲多作。干部根据实战经验和基本精神先作一简单的讲解，然后就让会的人去作，大家一边看一边讨论，纠正缺点，让大家依此榜样反复的作，直到领会其要领而后已。教材仅仅是作为干部指导的参考，纠正过去干部死教和战士硬学的方法；（三）互教互学，取长补短，不会什么学什么。军事方面的主要课目是战斗教练，技术则用空隙时间进行，在技术上为了使大家不会的学会，已会的提高一步，故进行了细密具体地分工，让会的人找帮助对象，保证把不会的人教会，没有帮助对象的，再进行苦练。如一连一百一十六人中，不会投弹的有二十三人，其中并有十六人不会打枪，于是把它们组织到军事互助小组里，去利用下午自学时间进行互助，其余会的人也就在这个月内进行苦练。
