　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th. A Jiaodong armed work team achieved victory in a night raid on Qingdao City. The team leader and deputy political instructor, Wang and Li, led three capable armed work team members. At 10 PM on the 10th of this month, they crossed the sea to attack the garrison of the Chiang bandit Qingdao Self-Defense Brigade in Taixi Town, Jiaxiang Road, Qingdao City. Wang and others entered the building, disguising themselves as coming from Chiang bandit headquarters. More than twenty Chiang soldiers in the room were listening to the radio. Suddenly, the whole place fell silent, and they hurriedly and diligently offered refreshments. At this time, Deputy Political Instructor Li suddenly pointed a pistol at the enemy, and the team members quickly stepped forward and seized all eight rifles and eight Mauser pistols from the wall. One enemy soldier tried to escape but was shot dead by us, while the others begged for mercy. Our five warriors, considering the mission accomplished, calmly withdrew, distributing propaganda along the way. The next day, the Chiang bandit newspaper in Qingdao published this news in a panic-stricken tone, saying that "more than 400 communist troops attacked in more than 100 ships." The Chiang bandits in Qingdao became even more terrified.

　　胶东我武工队渡海袭进青岛
  　缴获武器胜利归来
    【新华社华东二十八日电】胶东某武工队，夜袭青岛市获胜。该队队长及副政指王李二人，率精干武工队员三名，于本月十日夜十时，渡海袭击青岛市台西镇、嘉祥路蒋匪青岛自卫大队驻防地，王等进入室内，乔装从蒋匪司令部来的，室内二十余名蒋军正在收听广播，顿时全场肃然，急忙殷勤招待。此时，副政指李某突以手枪指敌，队员们迅速上前将墙上敌人的八支步枪和八支匣枪全部收起。一敌人想逃跑，当被我击毙，余者连求饶命。我五勇士以任务已达，乃从容撤出，并沿途散发宣传品。次日，青岛蒋匪报纸以惊惶失措的语调登载此一消息，说有“共军四百余乘船百余只来袭，”青市蒋匪更为恐慌。
