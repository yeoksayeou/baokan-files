　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Massey commented in a Moscow broadcast on the 28th, revealing that the U.S. imperialist "supervision" plan for aiding Chiang is actually a plan to destroy China by turning Chinese national sovereignty into nothing. The commentary is as follows:
　　The Soviet Chief Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Vyshinsky, spoke on November 21st about the issue of U.S. aid to other countries being supervised by the United States. His analysis of this issue is of particular significance to us. Three days prior to this, on November 18th, according to the Shanghai China U.S. Evening Post, when conducting economic aid negotiations with the United States, the Nationalist government agreed to allow the United States to supervise the use of U.S. loans. On November 10th, Marshall made the same request to the so-called European group in a speech to the U.S. Congress. Vyshinsky pointed out: In Marshall's speech, he claimed that the United States will carry out very important duties in Europe, and for this purpose, will appoint a special envoy to Europe to manage the Marshall Plan, to ensure that the assistance given by the United States is effectively utilized to "revive Europe." Vyshinsky said: In this way, whether the revival of certain European countries is effective or not is not determined by the European countries, but by the U.S. special envoy to Europe. It can be said that the sovereignty of European countries has been turned into nothing.
　　It must be pointed out that in recent weeks, the United States has designated candidates to serve as such special envoys not only for Europe but also for China. Not long ago, Bullitt proposed MacArthur as the supervisor of aid to Chiang. The "Sino-American Relief Agreement" signed in Nanjing on October 27th stipulated the establishment of such a special envoy mission. These special envoys enjoy the same privileges and treatment as the U.S. embassy. The U.S. special envoys are not only in charge of implementing "relief" supervision, but it is also stipulated that not only China's imports, but also the entire Chinese national industry and commerce and finance, must be subject to this supervision and leadership. U.S. special envoys will formulate economic plans for China and lead the development of certain sectors of the Chinese national economy. Officials in this delegation also enjoy the privilege of freely traveling around China and freely collecting information. After this, what is left of Chinese sovereignty? The Chinese people have already tasted the bitter fruits of this kind of assistance. After Japan's surrender, U.S. capital used the favors and promises it gave to the Nationalist Party to achieve great success in turning the Nationalist-controlled areas into U.S. colonies. In 1946, seventy-five U.S. companies controlled all U.S. exports to China and nine-tenths of U.S. imports to China. U.S. capitalists have acquired the operating rights of many so-called state-run joint companies established after Japan's surrender, such as the China Textile Company and the China-U.S. Aviation Company, etc. According to newspaper reports, not long ago, Song Ziwen, on behalf of the four major families, and the newly arrived U.S. financial advisor, Young, opened a huge concern in Guangzhou. This concern includes the development of the entire South China region and the operation of South China's mining, agriculture, industry, transportation, and commerce, selling these rights to U.S. capitalists. The number of economic and financial advisors and supervisors appointed by the United States to the Nationalist government is increasing day by day. The issue currently on the agenda of U.S. monopoly capitalists is to complete this economic enslavement and consolidate this enslavement organizationally.

### 所谓援蒋“监督”计划目的是掠夺中国主权  马西努揭露美帝侵华野心

　　所谓援蒋“监督”计划目的是掠夺中国主权
    马西努揭露美帝侵华野心
    【新华社陕北一日电】莫斯科二十八日广播马西努评论，揭露美帝国主义援蒋的“监督”计划，实际上就是将中国国家主权化为乌有的灭亡中国的计划。评论如下：
    联合国大会的苏联首席代表维辛斯基在十一月二十一日的演说中，讲到了由美国监督的美国对其他国家的援助问题。他对这个问题的分析对我们具有特别意义。在这三天以前，即十一月十八日，据上海华美晚报消息，在与美国进行经济援华谈判时，国民党政府同意由美国监督利用美国的借款。十一月十日马歇尔在美国会演说中对他所称的欧洲集团也提出了同样的要求。维辛斯基指出：在马歇尔的演说中曾经声称：美国在欧洲将执行很重要的职务，为此目的将委派欧洲专使，这个管理马歇尔计划的欧洲专使，以保证美国所给予的援助有效的利用来“复兴欧洲”。维辛斯基称：这样说来，欧洲某些国家的复兴事业有效与无效，不是由欧洲国家规定，而是由美国的欧洲专使来规定，这可以说：欧洲国家的主权已被化为乌有了。
    必须指出：在最近几星期来，美国方面不仅为欧洲，而且为中国亦指定了充当这种专使的候选人，不久以前，布立特曾提出以麦克阿瑟为援蒋监督人，十月二十七日在南京所签订“中美救济协定”已规定了建立这种专使使团，这种专使受有与美国大使馆同样的特权和待遇，美国专使不仅在于实施“救济”监督，其中且规定不仅中国的输入，而且整个中国民族工商业和财政，都得服从于这种监督和领导。美国专使将为中国规定经济计划，和领导中国国民经济某些部门的发展。这个代表团里的官员且享有在中国自由来往，自由搜集情报的特权。在这以后，中国主权还剩下什么呢？中国人民早已尝试过这种援助的恶果，在日本投降以后，美国资本即利用他们给予国民党的恩惠和种种约许，在把国民党统治区造成美国殖民地方面，已得到很大成绩。一九四六年七十五家美国公司操纵了美国对华全部输出，与操纵了美国对华十分之九的输入，美国资本家取得了很多日本投降后所建立的所谓国营联合公司的经营权，如中纺公司、中美航空公司等等。据报纸消息：不久以前宋子文代表四大家族和新近抵华的美国财政顾问杨格在广州开办了一个巨大的康采伦，这个康采伦包括开发整个华南，和经营华南矿业、农业、工业、运输业及商业，将这些权利出卖给美国资本家。美国委派到国民党政府的经济财政顾问与监视员，日益增多起来了。现时被列入到美国独占资本家议事日程中的问题，是完成这种经济的奴役和在组织上巩固这种奴役。
