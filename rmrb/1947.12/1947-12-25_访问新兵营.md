　　Visiting the New Recruit Barracks
    Xiao Feng
    The impassioned slogans of "Fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" and the village-wide sound of gongs and drums had just passed when I arrived at the Weixian Model New Recruit Barracks on the afternoon of the 29th.
    Walking into the Second Company headquarters, I ran into Wang Baorui, an old acquaintance of mine. The office was in his village, but it was rare to see him out of the house. He was a simple and honest farmer who would blush when he spoke. After the liberation, he thought about coming out to work all day long. As soon as this conscription started, he was the first to sign up and led more than thirty young and strong men to join the army. When we met, he was busy in the kitchen cutting mutton. He panicked when he saw me, pulled a stool for me to sit down, then brought water and invited me to eat meat and vegetables there. He said, "Comrade! You're here, don't be polite!" It had been more than half a month since we last met, and I always thought that he would not be used to the life at first and would feel troubled, so I first asked him how his life was. He said happily in a loud voice, "We can't finish eating the grain issued by the higher-ups. We improve our lives every two or three days. We just had mutton and vegetables this morning, and the company bought another sheep. The comrades are all clamoring not to eat it tonight, preparing to cook porridge, and the water has just boiled." Seeing that he was very happy, I asked him again how he felt compared to being at home. He said, "I've never been out before and was afraid of seeing strangers. Now, these young people of mine are playing around, talking and laughing all day long. It's much better than being bored at home." I said to him, "People in the village are very happy to hear that you have become a platoon leader." He blushed and quickly replied, "I can't do it! I'm a rough man and illiterate. I can't take notes when there's a meeting, which is so awkward! I have to learn culture quickly!" After finishing speaking, he asked me to take a look at his platoon. As soon as I entered, the soldiers shouted, "The platoon leader is here! The platoon leader is here!" and immediately surrounded him. The thirty or forty people were all young and strong men under the age of thirty-five, all of them were majestic and radiant. He pointed to the people in the platoon and said to me, "Look how great they are! They are not only young and strong, but also very smart. They are all liberated households who came voluntarily." Then he said very seriously, "I'm not boasting! If this group goes to the front line, they will scare old Chiang to death!" Everyone laughed at his words. One soldier said, "Our platoon leader has a very good temper, always telling jokes." I still had to visit other companies, so I only stayed for a while and came out. After Baorui saw me off, I asked him, "Are you sending a letter home?" He shook his head and said, "There's nothing to say. Tell my family not to worry about me!"
    After coming out from the fourth platoon, I went to see each company. The soldiers were all happily talking and laughing. The first company had just learned the song "We will not return until we defeat the reactionaries." The second company was learning the song "The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army." The family members were afraid that they would not be at ease, so they kept coming to comfort and visit them. Every time they came, they talked about the work and preferential treatment for the new soldiers in the village these days, but when they came here and saw that their sons and husbands were all overjoyed, they went back very happily without needing to comfort them. In a field, I saw a young woman talking to her husband, but the husband was busy going to a meeting. She didn't finish her words, so she hurriedly took out a ticket from her cloth bag and told him to buy something to eat when he was hungry. Her husband flushed and said anxiously, "We don't lack food or drink here. I haven't even spent my own money yet. What do I need yours for?"
    After the lights were lit at night, Li Dongze, a member of the Dazhangshan Troupe, sang Erhuang opera in the courtyard where he lived, attracting a yard full of people. Cheers and applause rang out. When he heard the news that he was leaving tomorrow, Zhang Lansheng, a soldier from the ninth squad of the third platoon of the second company, said, "I've been waiting for a long time! Let's go quickly! If we're late, we won't be able to catch up with fighting old Chiang!"

　　访问新兵营
    肖枫
    “打到南京去，活捉蒋介石!”的激愤口号和村村锣鼓喧天的声浪刚刚过去，廿九号下午我到了威县模范新兵营。
    走进二连连部，碰见了王保瑞，他是我的老熟人。机关就在他村住着，可是轻易不见他出过门。他是个朴素老实的农民，一说话就红脸。翻了身后，成天想出来干工作，这次扩军一开始他就首先报了名，并带领着三十多个青壮年参了军。我们见面时，他正在伙房里操持着切羊肉，看着我慌得他拉住了我，搬来凳子让坐下，随后又端水来，并要请我在那里吃肉菜，他说：“同志！到俺这啦，别客气！”有半月多没见面了，我总认为他乍出来，生活定不习惯，心里会嫌麻烦，就先问他生活怎样？他满高兴的大声说：“上级发的粮食吃不清，俺们三天两头改善生活，今上午刚吃了羊肉菜，连里又买了一个羊，同志们都吵着，晚上不吃了，准备熬稀饭，现在刚烧开水。”我见他很喜欢，又问他觉着比在家怎样，他说：“以前没出过门，怕见生人，现在俺这伙年青的，成天打打闹闹，说说笑笑，比在家里闷着可强多了。”我对他说：“村里人听说你当了排长，都很高兴。”他红着脸忙答道：“咱可不行！老粗不识字，开会有事不能记，可蹩扭哩！我还得赶紧学文化！”说完后，他叫我到他排里看看，一进门战士们乱嚷：“排长来了！排长来了！”马上把他围起来，三四十个人都是三十五以下的青壮年，个个雄赳赳，满面红光。他指着这排人对我说：“你看棒不棒？不但年轻力壮，心眼还强啦，都是翻身户，自觉自愿来的。”接着又很严肃的说：“不是俺吹大气！这伙子一到前线，把老蒋吓也吓毁了！”一句话说得大家都笑了。有一个战士说：“俺排长的脾气可好哩，光说笑话。”我还要到别的连队上去参观，站了一下就出来了，保瑞送出门后，我问他：“往家捎信不？”他摇了摇头说：“没一点事，给家里说吧！不用结记我！”
    从四排出来，又到各连去看了一看，战士们都在喜洋洋的说笑，一连才学会了“打不倒反动派不回来。”二连正学“人民解放军的三大纪律八项注意”歌。家属们怕他们不安心，不断来安慰和看望，每回来都谈到村里这几天给新战士作活和优抗情形，但他们来到这里，看见自己的儿子和丈夫都欢天喜地，用不着安慰就很高兴的回去了。在一个场园上，我看见一个青年妇女给他丈夫说着话，丈夫却忙着要开会去，她没说完话就忙着从布袋里掏出票子来，嘱咐他饿了买吃的，她丈夫急的红着脸说：“俺这里不缺吃不缺喝，我的钱还节约不化呢，要你的干啥？”
    晚上掌灯后，大张山的剧团团员李东泽在住的院子里唱二簧戏，招来了满院子人，叫好声和掌声响成一片。当听说明天要出发消息时，二连三排九班战士张兰生说：“早等麻烦了！快走吧！晚了就赶不上打老蒋了！”
