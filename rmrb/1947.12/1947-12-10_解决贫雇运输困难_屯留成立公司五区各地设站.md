　　Solving Transportation Difficulties for Poor Laborers
    Tunliu Establishes Company and Stations in Five Districts
    [Our Taiyue Report, 7th] Tunliu's winter production has been launched throughout the county, and a transportation and sales company has been established. After winter production began in various places, the question "What to transport?" was universally raised. There was no cotton to spin, cloth could not be sold, and they could not afford the travel expenses to sell local products elsewhere. This winter, each woman was required to spin ten catties of cotton, but they could not gradually spin and sell it, so they could not afford the capital. Some villages lacked livestock and could not transport large quantities. Therefore, the county's Winter Production Committee specially established a mass transportation and sales company, specializing in transporting ironware and coal for the military supply department, contracting to buy cotton and pay, establishing coal stations, and organizing the export of timber, native cloth, and oil to exchange for livestock. In order to support poor villages and care for hired laborers, it focused on controlling the use of loans, extracting a large part of the contracted freight charges to give to poor villages and hired laborers to buy livestock. The transportation and sales company was established on November 30th, and has already organized 4,500 bolts of native cloth for export to northwestern Shanxi, which is expected to be exchanged for 200 head of livestock.
    [Our Taiyue Report, 7th] Tunliu's Fifth District has established transportation stations to solve the transportation difficulties of hired laborers. Comrade Guo Yutang of the district's joint cooperative discovered that hired laborers faced great difficulties in both transportation and spinning during winter production. In addition to organizing mutual aid transportation teams of people and livestock, adopting a fifty-fifty profit-sharing method, he also temporarily borrowed a portion of funds from wealthy households in various villages as capital to solve the problem of food and lodging during transportation, establishing transportation stations in Tunliu City, Zhangdian, Liangma and other places. The transportation teams would not pay in advance when passing through, and would settle accounts and return the funds after earning money from transportation. The first batch of thirty-four carts has been organized and concentrated on December 2nd, and has begun transportation.

　　解决贫雇运输困难
    屯留成立公司五区各地设站
    【本报太岳七日电】屯留冬季生产，已在全县展开，并成立运销公司。当冬季生产在各地开始后，普遍的提出了“运输什么？”没棉花可纺，布匹推销不了，向外推销土货，路费贴不起，今冬每个妇女要纺十斤棉花，但不能逐渐纺织逐渐推销，因此本钱便垫不起，有些村子牲口太缺，不能大量运输，因此，县冬季生产委员会特成立了群众运销公司，专门向军供部包运铁器煤炭、包花交钱，成立煤站，组织木料、土布、油向外输出，换回牲口，并为了扶植穷村与照顾雇贫，有重点的掌握贷款的使用，将包来的运费中，抽出大部给穷村及雇贫买牲口。该运销公司，已于十一月三十日成立，现已组织了四千五百匹土布，向晋西北输出，预计可换回牲口二百头。
    【本报太岳七日电】屯留五区建立运输站，以解决雇贫运输困难。区联社郭玉堂同志，发现在冬季生产中，雇贫无论在运输或纺织上，均有很大困难。他除组织人畜力互助运输队，采取对半分红的办法外，并为解决运输时的食宿困难，向各村富裕户暂借一部基金作本钱，在屯留城、张店、良马等地，建立运输站，运输队过往时，暂不付钱，等运输赚到钱时，再结算归还。第一批已组织大车三十四辆，本月二日集中，开始运输。
