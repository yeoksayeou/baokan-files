　　Quwo, Jiang County, Yicheng
  　Young People Enlist to Fight Chiang Kai-shek
    Donghan and Other Villages Propose Three Agreements
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 4th dispatch] A warm wave of enlistment is also sweeping through the newly liberated areas of Quwo and Jiang Counties in Southern Shanxi. At a celebration rally of over five thousand people celebrating the counter-offensive and honoring meritorious service in Quwo, the slogans "The poor must turn over and join the People's Liberation Army" and "Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive and dig out the old root of disaster" were put forward. Chi Yunchang, Chairman of the Xizhao Morning Meeting, said it even better: "Family matters are handled by the family, and even middle peasants who hire labor should send their sons to join the army. If the peasants rule the world, the militia and peasant associations must not have bad eggs. Those who hire labor must hold the knife handle, and the People's Liberation Army must not allow targets of struggle to participate. They should also let those who hire labor hold the gun." Immediately, cadres from eight villages, including Ji'an, signed up. Donghan and other villages also put forward three requirements and three prohibitions: They want those aged eighteen to thirty-five, the sons of poor and middle peasants who have turned over, and those who are in good health; they do not want landlords who are targets of struggle, people with unclear political backgrounds, or those who are old, weak, or have infectious diseases. It is also necessary to achieve three agreements: the individual, the family, and the masses must all agree. At a cadres' meeting in Jiang County on November 24th, it was discussed that in order to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, it is necessary to join the People's Liberation Army. Feng Baocheng, a militia hero from the Fourth District, and six others immediately enlisted. Thirty people enlisted in Damiaodian, and the director of the Armed Work Committee also signed up voluntarily. In the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Districts alone, more than one hundred cadres signed up for the army. He Shui and Mei Village mutually guaranteed that they would not take in targets of struggle or force anyone. On the 26th, seventy-one students from Quwo Middle School also requested to join the army. Wang Rong, who is good at art, also said: "I want to bring art to the army and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Zhao Tianyi, who loves drama, also said: "We will fight to Nanjing and perform plays for a few days in Chiang Kai-shek's 'Golden Palace'." Currently, the wave of enlistment in Quwo and Jiang Counties is surging forward.
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 4th dispatch] The huge wave of enlistment in Taiyue has now swept to Yicheng. First, at a cadre meeting of 1,300 people in the Fourth District on November 21st, after discussing the great counter-offensive, 152 cadres requested to join the army. Another 117 male and female cadres wanted to send their sons, grandsons, and husbands to join the army. When they discussed fighting to Nanjing to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, they all excitedly shouted: "This can dig out this old root of disaster!" Li Xiuying, a female cadre from Beipo, said angrily: "Chiang Kai-shek brought the Japanese in and killed four members of my family. Now he wants to collude with the Americans to fight us. We cannot have peace without digging out this old root of disaster. I want to mobilize my younger brother to join the army." Li Yushan from Dongwang Village said: "The old root of the landlords is Chiang Kai-shek. Didn't Chiang Kai-shek bring the Japanese in before?!" Then some cadres requested to join the People's Liberation Army, fight to Nanjing, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive; this influenced many people to sign up or guarantee to mobilize their relatives to join the army. On the third day, in one evening, 152 cadres, including Wei Yuze, the instructor of Baima Village, voluntarily signed up to join the army. In addition, Feng Shi, a member of the Beiliangbi Peasant Association, Jing Liyun, and 20 others guaranteed to send their sons to join the army. Li Xiuying, a female cadre from Beipo, and 65 others guaranteed to mobilize their brothers to join the army. Li Cuiying from Xiliangbi, Hou Cuiying from Zhongyaozhuang, Chen Lanxiang from Beitang, and 13 other female cadres guaranteed to mobilize their husbands to join the army. Hou Quan'zhen from Xizhuang and 11 others guaranteed to mobilize their nephews to join the army. Zhou Sixin, the director of public security in Xizheng, and eight others guaranteed to mobilize their nephews to join the army. Liu Derong, a family member of a revolutionary soldier, sent his second son to join the army again. He said: "I am old, and my eldest son has already joined the army. Now to fight Chiang Kai-shek, we need strength. I have another strength (son), and I will take him out to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and then live a good life." Liu Enze, the deputy village chief of Wuchi, and his younger brother competed to join the army. Liang Zuocheng, a militiaman from Dongzheng, had just returned from a long expedition. When he heard about joining the army, he didn't even eat and rushed to sign up. Even Hou Yulan, a woman from Loudian, wanted to sign up. Now it has spread throughout the county, and everyone is vying to sign up and join the People's Liberation Army.
