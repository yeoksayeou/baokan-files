　　The reporter here optimistically stated: The emancipation and rise of tens of millions of people in the Central Plains, and their close integration with the People's Liberation Army, have made the combat power of our counter-offensive army unprecedentedly abundant. The close coordination of our three-route army will give the isolated Chiang bandits the punishment they deserve. The great victory in the southern section of Pinghan Railway is only the beginning of a series of even greater victories in the future.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yushan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 25th] Farmers along the southern section of the Pinghan Railway actively participated in our army's major sabotage operations. From the 14th to the 17th, more than 7,000 farmers in the Lin Ying and Xuchang areas voluntarily assisted our unit in destroying 55 *li* of railway, including the complete destruction of the Lin Ying and Dashiqiao stations and a water tower, more than 5,200 rails, more than 36,000 sleepers, and more than 900 electric poles. At dawn on the 14th, after our army liberated Luohe, an important supply point for the Chiang bandits in central Henan, more than 1,500 farmers from 70 villages in the Yancheng and Xiping areas drove more than 200 carts, helping the People's Liberation Army transport captured materials back and forth.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 25th] Frontline reporter Tang Ximin reported on the People's Liberation Army opening granaries to relieve the poor, distributing the military grain that the Chiang bandits had extorted from the people: The day after the recovery of Huang'an, 500,000 *jin* of grain stored in the city was distributed to the poor people in the city, and the People's Liberation Army helped many old women who were unable to carry the grain home. That afternoon, more than one million *jin* of grain stored in the Chiang bandit granary in Tangdiwan, 20 *li* southwest of the county seat, was distributed to the masses in 75 surrounding villages. Grain stored in the Chiang bandit township office granary in Zhulinhe, Xishui, was distributed to the poor people in the seven villages around Zhulinhe. More than 200 poor people carried grain all night long. In other places, such as Guangji, Yingshan, Wuxue Town, and Shangbahe, the People's Liberation Army distributed the grain stored by the Chiang bandits in the towns to the poor people in nearby villages, totaling more than 20 million *jin*. After capturing Wuxue Town, the 3 million *jin* of military salt stored in the Chiang bandit salt affairs office in the town, as well as 50 large boxes of various canned goods, more than 1,000 large barrels of milk powder, and hundreds of bags of flour stacked in the warehouse of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration for the use of the Chiang bandit army, were all distributed to the poor people in the town.

　　中原翻身人民崛起自卫解放军战斗力空前增强
    记者至此以乐观语气称：中原千万翻身人民之崛起自卫，及与解放军亲密结合，已使我反攻大军战力空前充沛。而我三路大军之密切配合，将予各孤立蒋匪以应得之惩罚。平汉南段之大捷仅是今后一连串更大胜利的开端而已。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十五日电】平汉路南段沿线农民在我军大破击战中踊跃参战。十四日至十七日间，临颍、许昌地区七千余农民自动协助我某部破路五十五里，计彻底破坏临颍、大石桥两车站及水塔一座，铁轨五千二百余条，枕木三万六千余根，电杆九百余根。十四日拂晓，我军解放豫中蒋匪重要补给点漯河后，郾城、西平地区七十余村庄共有一千五百余农民赶着大车二百多辆，往返帮助解放军搬运缴获物资。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十五日电】前线记者唐西民报导人民解放军开仓济贫，将蒋匪向人民搜括的军粮分发给人民情况称：收复黄安第二日，即将城内仓库存粮五十万斤全部分给城内贫民，许多老太太无力挑背的，解放军并替他们挑送到家。当日下午，又将县城西南二十里之唐堤湾蒋匪仓库存粮百余万斤分给周围七十五个村子群众。浠水珠林河蒋匪乡公所仓库存谷分给珠林河周围七个村子的贫民。两百多贫苦群众整整的挑了一夜。其他各地如广济、英山、武穴镇、上巴河等城镇蒋匪存粮，均经解放军分给附近各村贫民，总数在两千万斤以上。在攻克武穴镇后，并将该镇蒋匪盐务所存军盐三百万斤及行总救济分署堆置仓库供给蒋匪军用的各种罐头五十大箱、奶粉千余大桶与面粉数百袋，全部分给该镇贫民。
