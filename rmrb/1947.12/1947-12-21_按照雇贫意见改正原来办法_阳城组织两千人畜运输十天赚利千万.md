　　【This dispatch from our Taiyue office, 19th】Yangcheng's Fifth District organized 2,000 people and animal power to carry out large-scale winter transportation, earning over 10 million yuan in ten days. This year, Yangcheng suffered a grain shortage. In order to thoroughly resolve the difficulties of hired laborers, support mass production to overcome the famine, and lay a solid foundation for next year's spring plowing, the county government, the Jinnan Bank, and the County Cooperative purchased over 5,600 *shi* of wheat in Yicheng at 10,500 yuan per *shi*. This was distributed to each district based on the severity of the shortage, allowing the masses to transport it back and sell it themselves. Each *shi* could be sold for 22,500 yuan in Yangcheng, earning a profit of 12,000 yuan per *shi*, which was quite beneficial to the masses. Initially, it was decided that the masses would pay one *shi* of grain as capital to transport one *shi* of grain, but the hired laborers faced difficulties and pointed out that this method would not work. It was then changed to allow them to return the capital to the government after transportation. The county government, the Fifth District Office, and the District Cooperative all sent cadres to organize this large-scale transportation. Upon hearing that the government had come up with a good method, the masses of Yigu Village organized over 300 full and semi-laborers and 120 livestock, and solved the problem of hired peasant Su Zhixiang's lack of vehicles and cattle. Cadres also lent their own livestock to hired worker Liang Guangju. They started transportation first, and everyone saw the benefits, which influenced dozens of villages such as Licun, Mazhai, and Lujiahe, eventually forming a transportation boom of over 2,000 people and animal power throughout the district. Yigu Village transported 110 *shi* in one trip. Liu Xiaoyou sold the grain in Qinshui City and went back to transport a second trip. Shang Baogui, a hired peasant from Liu Village, said, "The first time, I drove a donkey carrying eight *dou* and carried two *dou* myself. After deducting expenses and capital, I earned over 5,000 yuan." According to incomplete statistics, the entire district has transported over 1,000 *shi* of grain in the past ten days. After returning the grain capital to the government, the masses can earn a profit of over 10 million yuan. The transportation is still in progress.

　　按照雇贫意见改正原来办法
  　阳城组织两千人畜运输十天赚利千万
    【本报太岳十九日电】阳城五区组织两千人畜力，进行冬季大运输，十天营利一千余万元。阳城今年粮食歉收，县政府、冀南银行、县联社，为了彻底解决雇贫困难，扶植群众生产渡荒，打好明年春耕基础，特在翼城购买小麦五千六百余石，每石一万零五百元，按歉收程度分发各区，由群众自己驮回出售，到阳城每石可卖二万二千五百元，除本可赚一万二千元，对群众相当有利。起初决定群众交一石粮的本钱运一石粮，可是雇贫有困难，提出这种办法不行，才改为运回以后再归还政府本钱，县政府、五区公所及区联社，都派干部组织这次大运输。宜固村的群众听到政府想出好办法，即组织了全村全半劳力三百余人、牲口一百二十余头，并给雇贫农苏志祥解决了没有车牛的困难，干部将自己的牲口也借给雇工梁广聚使用。首先开始运输，大家看到有利，影响了李村、马寨、吕家河等数十村，一直形成了全区两千余人畜力的运输热潮。宜固村一次运输了一百一十石，刘小有把粮运到沁水城粜了，折回去运第二趟。刘村雇农上宝贵说：“我第一次赶上毛驴驮了八斗，自己还背了二斗，除花消本钱以外，还赚了五千多元。据不完全统计，十天来全区已运粮一千余石，除归还政府粮食本钱外，群众可以赚利一千余万元，现运输仍在进行。
