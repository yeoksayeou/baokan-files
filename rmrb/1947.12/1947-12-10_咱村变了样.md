　　Our Village Has Changed
    Mu Xin
    Xifei Village in Mianchi County has 64 households, with poor peasants and farm laborers accounting for 30 households, middle peasants 26 households, and landlords and rich peasants 8 households. Among them, three large landlords, including Chen Xuanhua, sucked the blood of the peasants and controlled the village's power. They were all engaged in usury, with rents exceeding 50% and interest rates as high as 500%. In the spring, peasants borrowed six dou of grain from him and were forced to repay three shi in the autumn, resulting in the loss of ten mu of land. A middle peasant called a "fool" sometimes took a steamed bun or borrowed a sheng of rice from the landlord's house, and the landlord calculated a muddled account, "fucking" him out of ten mu of land.

    In early October, the Jiyuan Combat Team moved into the village. In the late autumn, it was cold and rainy, and most peasants were still wearing clothes that exposed their buttocks. The Combat Team took out seven pieces of clothing for the poorest families. As soon as the news spread, dozens of people immediately came to ask them to "find a solution." Li Zonglin, the instructor of the Combat Team, introduced the situation of the peasants in the old liberated areas who had turned themselves around to inspire their fighting spirit and courage, and said, "We will support you." The rain grew heavier and heavier, and more and more people came. Finally, everyone said in unison, "Let's get up and do it!"

    In the evening, a meeting of activists was held, attended by ten people: three farm laborers, three tenants, and four poor peasants. The first decision was to solve the food problem and discuss the crimes of the landlords and despots. It was decided to first distribute Chen Xuanhua's grain and movable property.

    The next day, at dawn, the activists led the masses to Chen's house and seized 5,800 jin of grain, as well as salt, vermicelli, and other items. Many people found their long-lost furniture in the landlord's house. A peasant woman grabbed a teapot and said with joy, "I've finally found you! That grandson borrowed this from me when he married his wife that year and insisted it was lost. Now I've got it back!" After that, the furniture and grain of the other two landlords, Chen Bingjun and Chen Bingguang, were also moved out.

    At first, a few middle peasant households in the village hesitated and waited to see what would happen. Later, seeing the power of the masses, they all joined in. A total of 160 people from the village came, and the grain and furniture were all gathered together. The distribution was unified by the farm association committee members and group leaders, who were the backbone of the poor peasants and farm laborers. The principle was that the poorest would get more, and furniture was "distributed according to what was lacking." A middle peasant who had hesitated at the beginning complained that he had received less. The vice chairman of the farm association criticized him, saying, "They are poor, of course they will take more. No matter how much they take, it's not as much as you have. Why don't you two families exchange your property? Now that the poor have turned themselves around, the people choose us to be fair." He was left speechless. At the beginning, some people were afraid of the landlords' watchdogs. Later, a poor peasant who sold tofu moved into the house that had been occupied by the landlord, greatly boosting the morale of the masses. Everyone said with smiling faces, "This is truly power to the peasants, and land returned to its homeland." Some people who had been hungry for several days found vermicelli in Chen Xuanhua's house and cooked a big pot, eating their fill first. Someone ran into the crowd and said, "The old rich man's pigsty is still grunting outside." Everyone said, "Let's slaughter one to celebrate the liberation." Later, there wasn't enough to go around, so it was all given to the extremely poor households who "hadn't eaten pork in decades."

    After distributing the movable property, they discussed distributing the land and decided to distribute the crops first, then the land. An old peasant came out and said repeatedly, "There is a way!" When asked why, he said, "My family has been allocated five mu of land, so isn't there a way?"

    On the third day, a meeting was held to elect the village head. Two upright peasants from extremely poor backgrounds were nominated. One was still hesitant, afraid that he couldn't do it. The other said, "We poor people have finally become village heads, why not do it?" Someone else suggested that so-and-so was good at calculations. Immediately, someone scolded him, saying, "Don't you think that he is working for the old rich man? Wouldn't he 'fuck' us to death? You still dare to use him?" Later, they found a poor peasant who had a rudimentary knowledge of writing to be the secretary. They said, "We must show the old rich men that we poor people can also accomplish things." Later, it was decided to form a militia to defend the fruits of the liberation. The Combat Team took out a gun for them.

    The Combat Team stayed for three days and then mobilized. After the Combat Team left, the mass movement continued to develop. Later, Comrade Li Zonglin returned to Xifei Village and the masses happily said to him, "Our village is different from the past. We have already united with Dongfei Village to struggle against the despots."

　　咱村变了样
    穆欣
    渑池西斐村有六十四户，贫雇占三十户、中农廿六户，地主、富农占八户，其中陈宣化等三家大地主吸干了农民的血，掌握村中大权，他们都是兼营高利贷者，租额超过百分之五十，利息高达百分之五百。农民春间向他借了六斗粮，秋后被迫还三石，结果折走了十亩地。一个叫痴（傻）子的中农，有时在地主家拿个馍，借升米，被地主算了笔糊涂帐，“日鬼”了他十亩地。
    十月初济源参战队进驻该村，深秋天寒又兼大雨，大多数农民仍然穿着露屁股的衣服，参战队便拿出七件衣服给最穷苦的几家。消息传出后，立即来了几十人请他们“想办法”。参战队指导员李宗林便把老解放区农民翻身的情形介绍给他们，启发他们的斗志和勇气，并说：“我们给大家撑腰”。雨越下越大，人越来越多，最后大家异口同声的说：“咱们起来干！”
    晚间召开了积极分子会议，到会十人，三个雇农、三个佃户、四个贫农。首先决定解决口粮问题，并讨论地主恶霸的罪恶，决定先分陈宣化的粮食和浮财。
    次日天一亮，积极分子便领着群众到陈家，斗出粮食五千八百斤及食盐、粉条等。很多人都在地主家里找到了自己失踪已久的家具。一个农妇抓着一把茶壶喜不自禁地说：“可找到了你，龟孙子那年娶媳妇借我的，硬说丢了，这回可斗回来了。”之后，其他两个地主陈炳钧、陈炳光的家具、粮食也被搬了出来。
    最初村里有几户中农犹豫观望，后来看到群众威势大，便都参加了。全村来了一百六十人，粮食家具都汇集一起。由贫雇骨干的农会常委和小组长统一分配。原则是赤贫多分，家具是“缺啥分啥。”有个开头犹豫的中农发牢骚说分得少了，农会副主席就批评他说：“人家穷，当然多拿，他拿的再多，也不如你多，要不你两家把家产换一换。如今穷人翻身了，众人选俺办事一定要公道。”说得他哑口无言。开头也有群众害怕地主的看家狗，后来一个卖豆腐的贫农搬到了原先被地主占去了的房子内，大大鼓舞了群众的斗志，大家笑容满面的说：“这才真是权利归农民，土地回老家”。有些饿了几天的人，找见陈宣化家的粉条，就煮了一大锅，先吃饱了再说。有个人跑进人群里说：“老财家那窝猪还在外边哼哩。”大家说：“先杀它一口过个翻身节。”后来不够分，便都给了“几十年没有吃过猪肉”的赤贫户。
    分完浮财后，又讨论分地，决定先分庄稼，再分土地。一个老农走出来后连说：“有办法”，问他为什么，他说：“我一家分了五亩地，不是就有了办法么。”
    第三天开会选村长，有两个赤贫的正派农民被提出来，一个还有些犹疑怕干不了。另一个就说：“咱穷人好容易当了村长，为啥不干？”又有人提出某某算盘好，立即有人呵斥他说：“你就不想想人家是给老财一股劲，可不把咱‘日鬼’死，还敢用他？”后来找了个粗通文字的贫农当书记。他们说：“要给老财们看看，光咱穷人也能办成伙事情。”后来决定成立民兵，保卫翻身果实，参战队抽出了一枝枪给他们。
    参战队住了三天就运动了。参战队走后，群众运动继续开展。后来李宗林同志又回西斐村一趟，群众高兴的对他说：“咱村现在和过去不一样了，已经和东斐村联合起来斗争恶霸了。”
