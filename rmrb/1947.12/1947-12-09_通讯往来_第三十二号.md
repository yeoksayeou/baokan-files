　　Number Thirty-Two
　　To Comrades Correspondents in Various Regions:

　　The winter production campaign has started one after another. Changzhi, Gaoyi, Pingshun, Shahe and other places have achieved preliminary results. Please vigorously report on the organizational situation of winter production in various places. Are poor and hired peasants the backbone leaders who control mass sideline mutual aid groups? Report on various production achievements and experiences in spinning, weaving, transportation, workshops, collecting mountain goods, etc., doing whatever you can. Is the leadership left to its own devices? Have the production conditions of the poor and hired peasants been met (tools, funds, mastering and improving production technology, etc.)? Has the cooperative become the core for supporting small-scale social production? Are industrial, commercial, and trade departments actively regulating the market and promoting products? And, reflect in a timely manner on issues or examples such as the masses collecting firewood in large quantities, accumulating fertilizer, purchasing farm tools and livestock in preparation for next year's large-scale production.

　　To Comrades of the Jiaozuo City Office and Wang Ruzhen, Lian Zhizhong:

　　The experience you reported on protecting grain and ensuring manpower in the Jiaozuo urban area: continuous and proactive attacks, with equal emphasis on political offensives and armed strikes, constantly obtaining the activity patterns of the enemy and puppets, launching large-scale landmine combined with cold gun and random gun (to confuse the enemy) explosion campaigns, joint defense operations where one place is attacked and all other places rush to support, and armed forces penetrating behind enemy lines to carry out political offensives and bury flying mines are all examples of the current struggle against the enemy in various border areas. It is hoped that continuous and in-depth reports will be made. In addition, please report in a timely manner on the opening of landmine training classes, rotating training of poor and hired peasant militias, mass proactive grain storage for war preparedness, village-by-village defense, and the struggle stories of Yang Juhe and other rotating combat teams.

　　To Comrades of the Anyang Office:

　　Please report in a timely manner on the progress of the ten thousand landmine campaign in your county, as well as the process, achievements, and experience of reviewing the militia and armed forces being controlled by poor and hired peasants.

　　The Editorial Department

  　第三十二号各地通讯员同志：
    冬季生产运动已先后开始，长治、高邑、平顺、沙河等地，并已初步获得成绩。请大力报导各地冬季生产的组织情形，是否贫雇为骨干领导掌握群众性的副业互助组？报导纺织、运输、作坊、采山货等啥能干干啥的种种生产成绩和经验。领导上是否自流？是否满足了贫雇生产条件（工具、资金、掌握与提高生产技术等）？合作社是否成为扶植小型社生产核心？工商、贸易部门是否积极调剂市场、推销产品？以及群众大量打柴、积肥、购置农具、牲口准备明年大生产等诸问题或范例都望及时反映。焦作市办公室及王汝珍、连志中诸同志：
    你们所报导焦作市区护粮、保丁经验：连续主动出击，政攻与武装打击并重，随时获得敌伪活动规律、展开大规模地雷结合冷枪乱枪（使敌慌乱）的爆炸运动，一处打响四处驰援的联防作战，武装深入敌后开展政攻与埋飞雷等都是目前各边地对敌斗争的范例，希连续深入报导。此外，关于开办地雷训练班，轮训贫雇民兵，群众性主动藏粮备战、村村设防，以及杨聚和等轮战队的斗争故事之类，均请及时反映。安阳办公室同志：
