[Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 7th Dispatch] Yongnian mobilized the masses through relief work, and the poor people of the whole city rose up to turn things over. After our democratic government entered the city, it first organized a city gate work team, allocated 60,000 jin of grain, and distributed grain according to the number of people for emergency relief, which helped many disaster victims survive. The second time, in mid-October, grain was lent again. Through the connection of the poor, 48 poor people's groups were organized, with a total of 686 households, distributing 16,998 jin of grain, providing relief to 1,511 people (including 37 households of revolutionary armymen families, 99 people), averaging 10 jin per person, and 13 jin for revolutionary armymen families. The third time, at the beginning of November, 607 households were given relief, helping 1,436 people, using 10,671 jin of grain. This time, the revolutionary armymen families received an extra 2 jin, and an additional commercial loan of over 10 million yuan was allocated. In this way, through relief work, the masses were mobilized, and a total of 73 poor people's groups were organized, totaling 1,188 households and 3,39 people. The masses elected four group leaders from the four streets and four passes, who were directly under the leadership of the work team. During the relief process, in addition to general class education, 19 group leaders were reorganized, and 9 members with bad elements were purged. The group leaders of each street automatically led the poor people to take oaths and formulated the discipline of the Poor People's Association: do not inform the landlords, do not hide things for the landlords, do not be bought by the landlords, do not accept bribes, do not embezzle the fruits of victory, do not monopolize or act as proxies, and do everything through the poor people's groups. At this time, the landlords were afraid of struggle, eating and drinking heavily, selling things, burying and dispersing materials. In the Eastern Street alone, the landlord Wu Jifu sold clothes worth 300,000 yuan. The poor people's groups held an emergency meeting to study and determine that big traitors, big merchants, and big landlords should all be placed under control. For example, Wu Xiangtun, who started out as a usurer, Fan Shuofu, a big landlord with 1,200 mu of land, and the four big landlords such as the Li family and the Dou family, and about 100 other traitors and bullies, were all liquidated by the masses. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 1 million Jibi yuan, 42.4 jin of silver ingots, 4,000 silver dollars, 1 jin of gold, and countless other clothes, woodenware, and porcelain were confiscated. In the process of connecting the poor people to seal up property and merge assets, the poor people who returned from outside the city played a great role. For example, Miao Shengde, the group leader of the South Street, recommended by the poor, connected 33 poor households himself. They automatically monitored the landlords and educated the masses. For example, Tong Xiniang, the group leader of the Eastern Street, had been hungry for three generations, relying on sweeping soil, picking up dung, and selling fruit to eat. During the relief, after receiving seventy or eighty jin of millet, his three grandchildren were saved from death. He was very active in the struggle, and also searched gold bracelets, gold rings, and good clothes from the women of the Wang family landlord. Once, he twisted his ankle, but he still worked as usual. She said: "The Eighth Route Army is the life-saving army, saving my life, and I have to do things well for the poor."

　　永年通过救济工作
  　组织贫民清算地主
    【本报冀南七日电】永年通过救济工作发动群众，全城贫民起来闹翻身。我民主政府进城后，首先组织城关工作队，拨粮六万斤，计口发粮，进行急赈，很多灾民赖以活命。第二次于十月中旬又贷粮，通过贫民串通，共组织了四十八个贫民组，共六八六户，发粮是一六九九八斤，救济一五一一人（内抗属三七户，九九口），每人平均十斤，抗属十三斤。第三次在十一月初，又发放六○七户，救济一四三六人，用粮一○六七一斤。这次抗属增二斤，另外拨商业贷款一千万余元。这样通过救济工作，发动群众，共组织贫民组七十三个，计一一八八户，三三九人。四街四关由群众选举四个大组长，直属工作队领导。在救济当中，除一般进行阶级教育外，又整理组织改造组长十九名，清洗坏成份会员九名。各街大组长自动领导贫民宣誓，制定贫民会纪律：不给地主通气，不替地主藏东西，不受地主收买，不吃贿赂，不贪污果实，不包办代替，一切通过贫民组。这时地主害怕斗争，大吃大喝，拍卖东西，埋藏和疏散物资。只东街地主武吉符一户，衣服就卖了卅万元。贫民组召开紧急会议，研究确定大汉奸、大奸商、大地主一律管制起来。如高利贷起家的武湘屯，拥有一千二百亩地的大地主范朔甫，和李家、窦家等四大地主及其他奸霸约一百余户，都受到群众清算，据不完全统计，共没收冀钞一百万元，元宝四十二斤四两，银元四千元，金子一斤，其他衣物木器瓷器无算。在串联贫民封产归并资财中，从城外归来之贫民起作用很大。如南街贫民公推的大组长苗生得，自己就串联了三十三户贫民，他们自动监视地主，教育群众。如东街小组长同喜娘，三辈子挨饿，靠扫土拾粪卖果子吃。在救济中，他领了七八十斤小米后，三个孙子得以不死。斗争中表现很积极，又从王姓地主妇女身上搜出金镯子、金戒指、好衣物。有次脚脖扭着了，也照常工作。她说：“八路军是救命军，救了俺的命，俺就得好好为穷人办事。”
