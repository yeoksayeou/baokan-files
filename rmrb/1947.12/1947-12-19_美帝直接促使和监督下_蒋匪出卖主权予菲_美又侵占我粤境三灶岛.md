    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 13th: The so-called "Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship" between the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities and the US puppet Philippine government, which was exchanged as early as October 24th, was announced by the Chiang bandit Central News Agency on the 9th of this month. This pseudo-treaty was concluded under the direct instigation and supervision of US imperialism and is part of US imperialism's "Far East Group" plan. The pseudo-treaty stipulates that Filipinos are allowed to enjoy "the same as nationals of third countries," actually the same as US imperialism, in terms of entry, travel, residence, assembly, publication, acquisition of movable or immovable property, and "freedom" to engage in trade throughout China. However, Article 9 of the pseudo-treaty specifically stipulates that "privileges that the Republic of the Philippines now or in the future grants to the United States of America or its nationals" "shall not apply" to China. This shows that the "Treaty of Friendship" is still entirely characterized by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek selling out China's various sovereign rights to the American running dog, the Philippines. Chiang and the Philippines, following the will of their American masters, also stipulated in the pseudo-treaty that they would "conclude a treaty of commerce and navigation as soon as possible" in order to further incorporate Chiang and the Philippines into the US-formulated US-Japan-Chiang-Philippines-Korea economic system, so that China, according to the US "raw material China" plan, not only transfuses blood to US imperialism's industry, but also transfuses blood to the industry of US imperialism's dependent countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 13th: TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 12th, citing Hong Kong's Hua Shang Pao: Sanzao Island in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong has been seized by US imperialism to build an air force base and listed as part of its South China invasion base group. This place was originally a Japanese air force base during the Japanese occupation, and the US military is now ordering Chiang bandit air force personnel to cooperate in its expansion.

    美帝直接促使和监督下
    蒋匪出卖主权予菲
    美又侵占我粤境三灶岛
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋匪当局与美国傀儡菲律宾政府间，早于十月二十四日即换文的所谓“中菲友好条约”，已于本月九日为蒋匪中央社公布。此项伪约系在美帝国主义直接促使和监督之下所缔结，为美帝国主义的“远东集团”计划的一部分。该伪约规定允许菲人在中国享有“与第三国国民同样”、实际是与美帝国主义同样的出入、旅行、居住、集会、出版、取得动产或不动产以及在中国全境经营贸易等项“自由”。但该伪约第九条，则特别规定“菲律宾共和国现在或将来给予美利坚合众国或其国民之优例”，“不适用”于中国。这就表明了该项“友好条约”仍然完全是以卖国贼蒋介石向美国走狗菲律宾出卖中国各项主权为其特点的。蒋菲且秉承其美国主子意旨，在该伪约中规定“尽速另订一通商航海条约”，以便将蒋菲进一步共同纳入美国所制定的美日蒋菲韩经济体系中，使中国依据美国的“原料中国”计划，不但为美帝国主义工业输血，且为美帝国主义的附庸国家工业输血。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社南京十二日电引香港华商报消息：广东粤江口三角洲之三灶岛，已被美帝国主义侵占建为空军基地，并列为其华南侵略基地群的一部分。该地在日寇占领时期原为日空军基地，美军现正命蒋匪空军人员协同扩修中。
