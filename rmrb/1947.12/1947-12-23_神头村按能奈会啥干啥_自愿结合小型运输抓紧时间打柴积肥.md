　　【Report from Neiqiu of Our Newspaper】After universal accounting, the people of Shentou Village in the Third District further understood the disaster situation and proposed five major items: gathering firewood, accumulating manure, spinning, weaving, and transportation, launching winter production. Hou Genzang first organized a small-scale agricultural and sideline industry cooperative in the North Street Team. Initially, 18 households participated, raising 300,650 yuan in capital, and started transportation, selling mountain goods, and exchanging for second-hand clothing. In just a few days, in addition to solving the seasonal clothing problem of 75 cotton garments for all team members, they also earned 110,000 yuan. The other three teams, seeing that Hou Genzang's team had organized a small-scale cooperative and made a fortune, also automatically organized shareholding and voluntarily formed small-scale cooperatives. Those who were willing or able to do something would do it. The credit cooperative provided specific assistance with 60,000 yuan to help those with poor funds. In this way, winter production in each team caused a sensation. For example, Guo Chen and others from the South Street Team organized charcoal burning, earning a profit of 40,000 yuan in one month. Liu Ming, Hou Delin, and others organized the sale of persimmons, earning 100,000 yuan in one month. Guo Shuangting and other four old men organized labor (building houses, walls, etc.), earning more than 20,000 yuan in addition to food. In addition to leading and organizing the women in the village to spin and weave, Ning Erwen also organized men to sell tofu at night to earn bean dregs. Liu Zhende organized milling flour and selling noodles. Other teams also organized small-scale cooperatives or small-scale transportation teams in groups of three or five, buying and selling goods themselves. For example, Ning Zhen group of the West Street Team, a total of five households, borrowed 30,000 yuan from the credit cooperative to buy charcoal and transport it eastward for sale, and transported necessities back, earning more than 110,000 yuan in a month and a half. Guo Chun and Hou Erseng group of the East Street Team borrowed 100,000 yuan to sell mountain goods and earned 100,000 yuan. Later, in order to save labor, each of the four teams in the village raised 300,000 yuan to organize a mountain goods station, and selected Han Cun, Hou Dezhong and other seven people to be responsible for unified purchase of mountain goods in the Fourth District, or unified purchase of necessities from below. After the purchase, each team organized unified transportation, which could save a lot of labor and capital. At the Village Committee meeting on the first day of the eleventh lunar month, the winter production achievements of the four teams in the village for a month and a half were summarized. Men's carrying, transportation and small-scale cooperative activities earned a total of 1,198,060 yuan, women spun 887.5 jin of thread, wove 225.5 bolts of cloth, gathered 191,280 jin of firewood, and accumulated 2,889 dan of fertilizer. After summarizing the achievements, everyone discussed and formulated the next phase of the plan. Hou Xiaosan said, "Next spring is short, and men must concentrate their efforts before the New Year to gather firewood and accumulate fertilizer." Hou Zhongxue, the captain of the East Street Team, said, "We should hold a meeting every half month, and the plan should be set every half month. My opinion is: male laborers should gather firewood for seven days and accumulate manure for one day every half month." Everyone passed these opinions, and after calculating the firewood consumption of the whole village, averaging five jin per person per day, it was decided that the firewood should be enough to burn until the wheat harvest next year, and the fertilizer should be accumulated to reach 60 dan per mu for paddy fields and 30 dan per mu for dry land. Gathering firewood and accumulating fertilizer take up eight days, and the remaining seven days should be spent on three days of transportation, two days of miscellaneous work, and two days reserved for public service activities. The mountain goods station should vigorously support the development of small-scale cooperatives, and make great use of whatever abilities they have. For women's spinning and weaving, all 186 spinners, 170 spinning wheels, 77 weavers, and 30 looms (only 28 of which can be used) in the village must be put into action. Each wheel must spin five liang of thread per day, and each loom must weave one zhang of cloth per day (including the average number of apprentices). We must ensure that the wheels and looms do not stop, and that there are more weavers than machines, so they must take turns weaving, so that everyone has work and the machines do not stop.

　　神头村按能奈会啥干啥
  　自愿结合小型运输抓紧时间打柴积肥
    【本报内邱讯】三区神头村，经过普遍算帐，大家进一步看清了灾荒，提出了打柴、积粪、纺织、运输、合作五大项，开展了冬季生产。侯根赃首先在北街队组织了农副业结合的小型社，当初参加了十八户，集了三十万零六千五百元的资本，搞起了运输，推销山货，换回了估衣，不几天除解决了全队社员七十五件棉衣换季，还赚洋十一万元。其他三个队，看到侯根赃队组织小型社发了财，也自动的组织集股，自愿结合成小型社，愿干啥或能干啥的就干个啥，雇贫资金困难的，信用部以六万元的资金具体帮助解决。这样，各队上的冬季生产都轰动起来。如南街队郭臣等，组织了烧木炭，一月赚红利四万元，刘明、侯德林等九户，组织了贩卖柿子等，一月赚洋十万元，郭双廷等四个老头，组织了做工（盖房垒墙等），除吃也赚了二万多元。宁二文除领导和组织全村妇女纺织外，又组织了男子晚上卖豆腐赚豆渣，刘振德组织了磨面、卖挂面等。其他队也同样三人一伙五人一组组织了小型社或小型运输组，自己买货自己运销，如西街队宁振组共五户，到信用部贷了三万块钱，买木炭向东运销，向回贩必需品，一月半赚洋十余万元，东街队郭纯、侯二僧组，贷了十万元贩卖山货，就赚了十万元。后来，为了更节省劳力，全村四个队，每队又集资三十万元，组织了山货栈，选出了韩存、侯德中等七人负责，统一到四区买山货，或统一到下边买必需品，买下后由各队组织统一运，这样能节省很多劳力和资金。到阴历十一月初一的生委会上，将全村四个队一个半月的冬季生产成绩作了总结，男子担挑运输及小型社活动，共赚洋一百一十九万八千零六十元，妇女纺线八百八十七斤半，织布二百二十五匹半，打柴十九万一千二百八十斤，积肥二千八百八十九担。总结成绩后，大家讨论订下期计划。侯小三说：“明年春短，男子在年前要集中力量打柴、积肥。”东街队长侯中学说：“咱们半月一开会，计划要半月一订，我的意见是：男劳力半月打七天柴，积一天粪。”大家通过了这些意见，对于全村烧柴作了计算，每人每天平均以五斤计，决定今冬要将柴打的够烧到明年麦天，粪要积的水地每亩达到六十担，旱地达到三十担。打柴积肥占去八天，下余七天，要搞三天运输，两天作杂活，两天留为支差等活动，山货栈要大量扶植小型社发展，有啥能奈要大量发挥。妇女纺织，全村一百八十六个纺妇，一百七十辆纺车，七十七个织妇，三十张布机（只二十八张能使）要全部动起来，每辆车每天要纺五两线，每张机每天要织一丈布（包括学手平均数），要作到车不闲机不停，织妇多机子少，要轮换着织，作到人人有活，不住机子。　（神头联合通讯组、治安执笔）
