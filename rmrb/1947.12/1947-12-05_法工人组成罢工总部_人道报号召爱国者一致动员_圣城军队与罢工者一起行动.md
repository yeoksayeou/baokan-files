Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Comprehensive reports: The situation in France is extremely tense. After the postal workers' union, the Paris public utilities union, the entire French miners' union, and even the Algerian railway workers' union issued a general strike order on the 28th, "French economic life has almost come to a standstill" (United Press reported on the 30th). Twenty-one striking unions, led by the General Confederation of Labor Secretary, Thorez (a leader of the French Communist Party), have formed a "General Strike Headquarters." The mood of the French workers is extremely激昂(jī áng) (high-spirited, impassioned), and to respond to the reactionary plot to arrest strike leaders, Thorez is now protected by a "strong personal guard composed of workers" (United Press). The Schuman government, under the instruction of American imperialism, on the one hand, submitted an illegal request to the parliament on the 29th, requesting the parliament to grant it the following powers: (1) increase police power; (2) completely revise the strike law; (3) punish absenteeism, especially taking severe measures against transportation workers; on the other hand, it sent Labor Minister Meyer, a member of the Socialist Party, to negotiate with the General Confederation of Labor, threatening striking workers with force to submit. But this arrogant attempt has failed. On the evening of the 29th, the General Confederation of Labor's National Strike Committee issued a statement urging all striking workers to defend their movement, defend the organs of the trade union, and defend the heroic trade union members and all organizations and newspapers that stand by them and fight. L'Humanité also issued an extra edition, declaring: "An American party (referring to the de Gaulle Alliance) is tearing up the constitution, and it wants to murder the Republic. All people have only one slogan: heighten vigilance, unite, and mobilize!" L'Humanité called on "Workers, democrats, patriots, you are strong enough to stop this crime!" This call from L'Humanité made the French reactionary authorities extremely frightened, so they instructed the police to surround L'Humanité and "Tonight" newspaper offices, confiscating the paper containing this call, in an attempt to keep it from being known to the workers. However, this call, like a thunderbolt, quickly resonated among the workers. At the same time, according to a United Press report on the 29th, Marshall again issued a provocative statement in London, believing that the situation in France was "extremely serious" and cheering on the French reactionary authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Paris News: On November 29th, a major event occurred in Saint-Étienne, southeastern France, where troops refused to obey the reactionary orders of the Schuman government and acted together with the strikers. On that day, after thousands of strikers gathered at the employment agency, they sent a delegation to the city government to submit the strikers' demands. The authorities sent a motorized police team to prevent the delegation from approaching the city government, which immediately caused a large demonstration of about 100,000 working people. The police used tear gas to disperse the crowd, but this move aroused strong indignation among the masses, who threw iron blocks at the city hall. The authorities then sent troops in three armored vehicles to try to assist the police, but the troops refused to obey orders. L'Humanité wrote about this incident: "Salute to the soldiers of Saint-Étienne! Like their older brothers in the 17th Regiment who refused to fire on the rebellious vineyard workers in 1907, they do not oppose the people, but together with the people, set off towards the central railway station occupied by the motorized police. The police retreated, and the strikers, supported by the soldiers, occupied the railway station."

　　法工人组成罢工总部
    人道报号召爱国者一致动员
    圣城军队与罢工者一起行动
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：法国局势极为紧张。二十八日邮务工会、巴黎公用事业工会、全法矿工工会乃至阿尔及利亚铁路工会之总罢工令发出后，“法国经济生活几已陷于停顿”（合众社三十日电）。二十一个罢工工会已以总工会书记佛拉商（法共领袖之一）为首，组成“总罢工总部”。法国工人的情绪极为激昂，为回答反动派逮捕罢工领袖之阴谋，佛拉商已由“工人组成的强力随身卫队”（合众社）所保护。舒曼政府在美帝国主义授意下，一方面于廿九日向议会提出非法要求，要求议会授以如下权力：（一）增加警察权力；（二）全部修改罢工法；（三）惩罚怠工，特别是对交通工人采取严厉措施；另一方面则派劳工部长社会党人梅耶与总工会谈判，以武力威胁罢工工人屈服。但此一狂妄企图已告失败。二十九日晚总工会全国罢工委员会发表声明，敦促一切罢工工人保卫他们的运动，保卫工会的各机关，保卫英勇的工会会员和一切站在他们一边作战的组织和报纸。人道报亦发出号外，宣称：“一个美国的党（按指戴高乐联盟）在撕毁宪法，他要谋杀共和国。一切人们只有一个口号：提高警惕团结一致，动员起来！”人道报号召“工人们，民主人士，爱国者，你们是够强大的，能制止这种罪行！”人道报此一号召使法国反动当局恐惧莫名，乃指使警察将人道报及“今晚”报馆包围，没收载有此项号召的纸型，企图使其不为工人所悉，然此一号召却象急雷闪电一般，迅即在工人群众中间取得回鸣。与此同时，据合众社二十九日电，马歇尔在伦敦再次发出挑拨性声明，认为法国局势“极为严重”，并为法国反动当局打气。
    【新华社陕北三日电】巴黎讯：法东南部圣德田城上月二十九日曾发生军队拒绝服从舒曼政府反动命令，并与罢工者一起行动的重大事件。当天数千罢工者在职业介绍所集会后，派代表团赴市府呈递罢工者的要求，当局派遣摩托化警察队阻止代表接近市府，于是立即引起约十万劳动人民的大示威。警察为冲散群众，竟使用催泪弹，但此举却激起了群众的强烈愤慨，群众乃以铁块投击市政府。当局又派三辆装甲车的军队企图援助警察，但是军队拒绝服从命令。人道报对此事写道：“向圣德田城士兵致敬！和他们的老大哥第十七团在一九○七年拒绝向起义的葡萄园工人开枪一样，他们不反对人民，而和人民一起，向被摩托警察所占据的中央火车站出发。警察退却了，而受到士兵支持的罢工者占领了火车站。”
