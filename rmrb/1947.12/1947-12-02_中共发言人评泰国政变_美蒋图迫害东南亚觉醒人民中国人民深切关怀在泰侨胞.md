　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 30th: A spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party commented on the Thai coup, stating: The coup that occurred in Thailand on the night of November 8th was launched by the notorious Thai fascist Luang Phibuns under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang secret agents. The aim of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in orchestrating this coup is to attempt to establish a reactionary center in Southeast Asia to oppose the increasingly awakened people of Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. Because Luang Phibuns is a notorious lackey of Japanese fascism, a group of aristocratic bureaucrats were pushed to the forefront after the coup. Although U.S. imperialists do not yet dare to openly express support for Luang Phibuns, they have, together with Chiang and the Philippines, openly supported the delegation sent by the Nai Khuang Aphaiwong government, which came to power after the reactionary coup, to participate in the Far East Economic Conference. Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang secret agents are even more elated, and Chiang's bandit government's ambassador to Thailand, Li Tiehzheng, has already proposed to the Nai Khuang Aphaiwong government that it close down the democratic newspapers of the overseas Chinese and arrest hundreds of overseas Chinese democratic elements as preconditions for Chiang's bandit government to recognize the Nai Khuang Aphaiwong government. The CCP spokesperson stated: Because there is a large number of overseas Chinese in Thailand, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people cannot but express concern about the Thai coup, especially about the possible fate of the overseas Chinese in Thailand. Whether the Thai coup will continue to be used by Chiang and the U.S. to repeat the anti-Chinese policy of Japan-Luang Phibuns, harming democratic overseas Chinese, is a matter of deep concern to the CCP and the Chinese people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 20th: Bangkok News: A coup occurred in Thailand on the night of November 8th, and the original Prime Minister Luang Thamrong and his important cabinet members were forced to flee. This coup was masterminded by the collaborationist fascist Luang Phibuns. Luang Phibuns had launched a coup in 1932, overthrowing the old royalist forces in Thailand. After coming to power in 1938, he suppressed the democratic movement internally and pursued a pro-Japanese policy externally. Most of the foreign advisors employed by the Luang Phibuns government were Japanese, and Luang was also the main culprit in the large-scale massacre of overseas Chinese in 1939. Shortly after the outbreak of the Pacific War, he cooperated with the Japanese invaders and declared war on the Allied countries. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, due to the appeasement policy of the British and Americans, the militarist forces in Thailand, headed by Luang Phibuns, were not only not purged, but became even more rampant. This is the reason for this coup. The new cabinet list was announced on the 10th as follows: Prime Minister Nai Khuang Aphaiwong (who was the Prime Minister during the Japanese occupation from 1944-45 and belongs to the Thai conservative faction), Foreign Minister Yakat, Finance Minister Cai Yangde, Minister of Justice Pula Jingte, Minister of Interior Yuodalake, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Prince Diwien, etc.; the new cabinet is purely a combination of militarist elements and conservative forces.

　　中共发言人评泰国政变
    美蒋图迫害东南亚觉醒人民中国人民深切关怀在泰侨胞
    【新华社陕北三十日电】中共发言人评论泰国政变称：十一月八日夜泰国所发生的政变，是泰国著名法西斯分子銮披汶在美国帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮特务的策动之下发动的。美国帝国主义与蒋介石匪帮策动此次政变的目的，是企图在东南亚建立一个反动中心，来反对泰国和东南亚各国日益觉醒的人民。由于銮披汶为日本法西斯走狗，臭名昭著，所以在政变之后拥出贵族官僚登台。美国帝国主义者虽尚不敢公开表示支持銮披汶，但对反动政变后登台的乃宽亚拜温政府，却已与蒋、菲一起公开支持它派出的代表团参加远东经济会议。而蒋介石匪帮特务则更兴高采烈，并已由蒋匪政府驻泰大使李铁铮向乃宽亚拜温政府提出以封闭华侨的民主报纸与逮捕数百名华侨民主分子，作为蒋匪政府承认乃宽亚拜温政府的先决条件。中共发言人称：由于在泰国有人数众多之华侨，中国共产党及中国人民对泰国政变，尤其对泰国华侨可能的遭遇，不能不表示关切。泰国政变是否继续为蒋美利用重演日本——銮披汶的排华政策，使民主华侨受害，乃是中共与中国人民所深为关切的问题。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】曼谷讯：十一月八日夜泰国发生政变，原内阁总理銮贪隆及其重要阁员被迫出奔。这次政变系由通敌法西斯分子銮披汶主谋。銮披汶曾于一九三二年发动过一次政变，推翻了泰国旧保皇党势力。一九三八年执政以后，对内镇压民主运动，对外实行亲日政策。銮披汶政府时期聘用之外籍顾问中，大多数系日人，銮氏又是一九三九年大规模屠杀华侨的凶犯。太平洋战争发生不久，即与日寇合作向同盟国宣战。日寇投降后，由于英美的纵容政策，以銮披汶为首的泰国军国主义势力不但未被肃清，反而更形猖獗，这是发生这次政变的原因。新内阁名单已于十日公布如下：总理乃宽亚拜温（系一九四四年——四五年日寇统治期间的总理，属于泰国保守派），外长雅卡，财长蔡扬德，司法部长普拉经特，内长约达拉克，农林部长地威恩王公等；新内阁纯系军国主义分子与保守势力之结合体。
