Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 19th: The field hospital and rear hospital of a certain unit of the Central China People's Liberation Army are competing to transfuse blood to save the wounded. The two hospitals have jointly established eight voluntary blood transfusion teams, with participants ranging from the director of medical affairs to cooks, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total number of people. Nurse Hua Lan transfused 170 CC of blood at one time to save a seriously wounded soldier, who was thus rescued. The deputy section chief also transfused blood three times, reaching 200 CC. After the campaign was launched, it not only saved dying wounded soldiers but also improved their political awareness and encouraged their courage to kill the enemy. At the celebration meeting, the recuperating wounded soldiers said in a letter of appreciation to the hospital staff: "Your blood saved us from the brink of death. This is your contribution. After we are discharged from the hospital, we will repay you by doing all our work well and eliminating more enemies."

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 23rd: In order to overcome the difficulties of winter operations, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has enthusiastically launched a campaign to keep the wounded warm. Health departments at all levels have widely conducted education on keeping warm and studied methods to keep warm. The wounded soldiers' rooms have stoves and heated beds, so the room temperature is always kept above 60 degrees. Some units have even set up special warming rooms to provide first aid to the more severely frozen wounded soldiers. Many comrades have promoted class friendship and donated their own clothes, quilts, and sheets to keep the wounded warm. The stretcher bearers accompanying the army have also received education on keeping warm. During transportation, they put chicken feathers, roasted bran, fried noodles, heated bricks, and hot water bottles in the wounded soldiers' arms. When resting on the road, the stretcher bearers stand on the north side of the stretcher to block the cold wind and give their quilts and blankets to the wounded soldiers. Their slogan is: "Don't let the wounded soldiers say a single word about being cold." Under the slogan of "Accelerate transportation and strive for fast shifts," the seventh squad of the first company of a certain stretcher battalion carried five shifts in one night, covering a total of more than 110 li back and forth.

　　华中某部前后方医院
  　争相输血抢救伤员
  　华东开展伤员保温运动
    【新华社华东前线十九日电】华中解放军某部野战医院及后方医院，争相输血抢救伤员。两院共成立八个志愿输血队，参加者自医务主任以下直至炊事员，占总人数三分之二以上。招护员花兰为抢救一重伤员，一次输血一百七十ＣＣ，该伤员因此得救，副室长亦三次输血达二百ＣＣ。运动开展后，不仅挽救了垂死的伤员，且提高了伤员的政治认识，鼓舞了杀敌勇气。在庆功大会上，休养伤员给医院工作同志的慰问信上说：“你们的鲜血将我们从死亡的边缘上救回，这是你们的功劳，我们出院后，要用做好一切工作和多消灭几个敌人来报答你们。”
    【新华社华东前线二十三日电】为克服冬季作战困难，解放军某部热烈开展伤员保温运动，各级卫生部门普遍进行保温教育，研究保温办法，伤员室内生有火炉，并烧热炕，使经常保持六十度以上的室温。有的单位，更特辟保温室，以便急救受冻较重的伤员。许多同志发扬阶级友爱，献出自己的衣服被单等，为伤员保温。随军担架队员，亦经保温教育，在转运途中，他们用鸡毛、炒糠、炒面、烧砖、热水瓶等放在伤员怀里。路上休息时，担架队员们站在担架北侧，挡住寒风，并让出被子毯子给伤员盖。他们的口号是：“不让伤员说一个冷字。”在“加速转运，争取快速班”的口号下，某担架营一连七班，一夜间抬了五趟，往返合计走了一百一十多里。
