    Jia Village Combines Labor, Capital, and Technology
    Many Avenues for Mutual Aid Production

[This Newspaper, Changzhi News] Wang Hushan of Jia Village, Second District, convened a meeting of the entire group to rectify mutual aid, settle accounts, and check "cultivate three, surplus one." After calculating family assets and comparing time, the idea of becoming richer and richer was established, breaking the paralysis, complacency, the idea that "it's better than last year," and the mentality of passively waiting. The whole group made a production plan. Wang Hushan said, "Don't bother calculating for me, I'm not a problem. I can get 'cultivate one, surplus two!'" So everyone first calculated for Hushan. After detailed calculations, the food, clothing, and all miscellaneous expenses of his family of three, including salt and oil, were not enough to cover the whole year's expenses. Therefore, Hao Qifu, a newly liberated peasant, said with emotion: "I thought that I used to harvest eight dou of grain and more than one shi of corn a year, and I could get through the year. This year I harvested six or seven shi of grain, isn't that enough to eat and wear? I thought it was my turn to enjoy life." After this calculation, everyone realized that it was far from enough." Everyone deeply felt that no household in the whole group could get "cultivate three, surplus one." From then on, the ideas of paralysis and complacency were broken, and the calculation of family assets and comparison of time began. From household to group, everyone unanimously felt that just eating wasn't enough, and they had to do a good job in sideline production to fill the hole. Wang Hushan's group felt that they had labor but no production conditions and could not find a way to produce. The original Zhengqi and Wang Baidan groups, after calculating their family assets, also felt that they had to engage in production, but they lacked labor and could not engage in sideline production. The original Zhengqi group had six laborers, five of whom could make pots, and three livestock. Making casseroles meant they couldn't herd the livestock, and herding the livestock meant they couldn't make casseroles. The Wang Baidan group had a total of five laborers, four of whom were carpenters, and two and a half livestock. Opening a carpentry shop meant they couldn't accumulate fertilizer, and no one would buy raw materials or promote finished products. Everyone felt that they couldn't manage without mutual aid. Doing this meant they couldn't do that. This broke the ideological obstacle that sideline production could not be mutually aided. The three groups combined into a large mutual aid team. Everyone happily discussed and found avenues for production, opening a casserole kiln and a carpentry factory. They also made specific divisions of labor: seven livestock to pull raw materials, deliver finished products to the city, sell coal in their spare time, three people to make casseroles, four people to do carpentry, two to buy raw materials, three to sell finished products, one and a half laborers to do odd jobs, and one full laborer to lead three half-laborers to accumulate fertilizer, smoke tiger caves, and combine with burning ash to do odd jobs for each family's livelihood. They discussed the equivalent distribution of dividends based on technology, and their enthusiasm was very high. The casserole kiln has been running for three or four days, and four kilns will be fired by the end of this month, which can be sold for ten shi and eight and a half dou of rice.

    贾掌劳力资金技术大结合
    互助生产门路多
    【本报长治讯】二区贾掌村王虎山召开全组会议，整顿互助，清算帐目，检查耕三余一。经过算家当，比时光，树立了富了更富的思想，打破了麻痹、自满、比往年好过、消极等待思想，全组订出生产计划。王虎山说：“不用给我算，我是不成问题，能得到耕一余二啦。”大家就先给虎山算，经详细计算，三口人吃穿、连上吃盐、油等一切杂花费，还不够全年开支。因此感动的新翻身户郝起富说：“我想我以前一年收八斗谷，一石多玉茭，还能过一年，今年我收了六、七石粮食，还不是有吃有穿啦，这就轮着咱享福啦。经过这样一算才知道差的远。”大家都深刻感到全组没有一户能得到耕三余一，从此打破了麻痹自满思想，展开了算家当、比时光，由户到组，大家一致感到光吃还不很够哩，非好好的搞副业填窟窿不行。王虎山组感到有劳力没有生产条件，找不到生产门路。原争气、王白旦两组，经算家当后，也感到非生产不行，就是缺乏劳力，不能搞副业。原争气组是六个劳力，五个会做锅，还有三头牲口，做沙锅就不能赶牲口，赶牲口就不能做沙锅。王白旦组共五个劳力，就有四个是木匠，有两头半牲口，开木铺不能积肥，没人购买原料和推销成品。大家都感到不互助起来顾不过来，做了这样干不了那样，由此打破了搞副业不能互助的思想障碍，三组合成了一个互助大队。大家高兴的讨论，找出了生产门路，开锅窑一个，木工厂一个；并具体分工：七头牲口拉原料，往城里送成品，抽时间卖煤，三个人做沙锅，四个人做木工，两个买原料，三个人卖成品，一个半劳力打杂，一个全劳力领导三个半劳力积肥，薰老虎洞，结合烧灰做各家的零碎生活。按技术订分，讨论了等价分红，情绪非常高涨。锅窑现已开始三、四天了，本月底就要烧出四窑，能卖十石八斗半米。（乔高升、孙发生）
