Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—According to Shanghai newspapers: Since this autumn, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities have been frantically conscripting soldiers everywhere, and the people have risen up in armed resistance. Youths from five counties in southeastern Fujian, including Nan'an, have formed a "Conscript Grand Alliance" and joined forces with local people's armed forces to oppose Chiang Kai-shek. In Peiwen Township, at the intersection of Zhong County, Liangshan, Wan County, Sichuan, during the Chiang bandit conscription period, people in groups of three or five, carrying knives and sticks, guarded their hometowns, saying, "Nowhere to escape, if you try to grab me, I'll fight you." In Hengjing Town, Suzhou, Jiangsu, more than two hundred people severely beat the Chiang Kai-shek political police responsible for conscription during the Chiang bandit conscription, and closely monitored the local Chiang bandit district public office, preventing it from taking action.
    In other news: Chiang Kai-shek's conscription personnel extort and make a fortune during conscription, with layers of dark secrets. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Suzhou planned to conscript 1,535 people, with an average "settlement fee" of 7 million Chiang coins per person, totaling more than 10 billion. However, most of this money, extorted from the people, was embezzled by Chiang Kai-shek county, district, and township personnel. Liu Changzhao, a farmer from the 8th Bao of Chenji Township, 8th District, Jiangdu (i.e., Yangzhou), was conscripted into the army in mid-August, and his family only received a "settlement fee" of 15,000 Chiang coins, but the township head forced them to write a receipt for 4 million yuan. Local township chiefs and Bao chiefs, due to the difficulty of conscription, set up "temporary conscription offices" in Suzhou and Zhenjiang hotels to trade conscripts and profit from them. Chiang Kai-shek township chiefs and Bao chiefs in Nanhui and other places traveled to Shanghai to buy conscripts, buying them cheaply and selling them at high prices. Wang Jiefu, the Chiang Kai-shek county magistrate of Suzhou, ordered his brother, Wang Baoyi, to openly use the Suzhou Oriental Hotel as a conscript trading place, selling more than ten security team members he brought from his tenure as the county magistrate of Danyang County to the town head of Dongqiao Town in the county at a high price, and the town head collected "settlement fees" from the people at even higher prices. The same situation exists in Ningbo, Zhejiang. Chiang Kai-shek personnel in Ningbo bought conscripts from Shanghai for 3 million yuan each and sold them to local Bao chiefs at 3.5 million yuan. The Bao chiefs then extorted "settlement fees" from the people at 4 to 5 million yuan each.

### “你来拉我就和你拼！”　闽川人民武装抗丁

　　“你来拉我就和你拼！”
  　闽川人民武装抗丁
    【新华社陕北一日电】据上海报纸披露：今秋以来蒋匪当局在各地疯狂征兵抓丁，人民纷起武装反抗。闽东南南安等五县青年组成“壮丁大同盟”，与当地人民武装汇合反蒋。四川忠县、梁山、万县、交界处之培文乡在蒋匪征兵期中，皆三五成群，身带刀棍，守卫家乡，他们说：“如今没处逃，你来拉我，我就和你拼。”江苏苏州横泾镇二百余群众于蒋匪征兵时，将负责抓丁之蒋匪政治警察痛殴，并对当地蒋匪区公署严密监视，使其不敢活动。
    另息：蒋匪征兵人员在征兵中肆行勒索，大发横财，黑幕重重。苏州蒋匪预定征额一千五百三十五名，平均每次须付蒋币安家费七百万元，总计达一百亿元以上，但此款向人民勒索取得后，大部为蒋匪县区乡人员吞没。江都（即杨州）八区陈集乡八保农民刘长朝八月中被抓去当兵，其家属仅得安家费一万五千元蒋钞，乡长却迫令写四百万元的收据。当地乡保长因抓丁困难，在苏州镇江旅馆中遍设“临时收丁处”，进行壮丁交易，并从中渔利。南汇等地蒋匪乡保长皆远道至沪购买壮丁，贱价买进，高价卖出。苏州蒋匪县长王介佛令其弟王保义，公开以苏州东方饭店卖兵交易处，将王在丹阳县长任内带来之保安队十余名，高价售与该县东桥镇镇长，该镇长又以更高价格向人民征收“安家费”。浙江宁波亦有同样情形，宁波蒋匪人员从上海以每名三百万元价格买得壮丁，以三百五十万元售与当地保甲长，保甲长再以每名四百至五百万元向人民征索“安家费”。
