[This dispatch comes from] Our Newspaper's Taiyue [Mountain Region] Bureau, 15th [of December]. Jincheng this year has experienced widespread crop failure due to both flood and drought. With the exception of some villages in the Second and Fifth Districts which harvested 80% of their autumn crops, most of the county only saw a harvest of 30-40%. The Third District's Yaotou, Yuneng, Heba, and Lingtou villages in particular had even smaller harvests. In Yuneng village, after paying the public grain, each person has an average of nine *dou* of coarse grains, which, supplemented with bran and vegetables, will only last until the end of the lunar year. Yaotou and other villages have an average of only four *dou* of coarse grains per person, which won't even last until the end of the year. The most difficult situation is faced by hired and poor peasants, who not only lack money and livestock for production but also currently lack food and supplies. Based on an investigation of Heba, Lingtou, Jiaquan, and other villages in the Third District, the various difficulties faced by hired and poor peasants in winter production are truly unimaginable without in-depth contact with this class.

The Second Mutual Aid Group in Xilingtou Village has a total of 27 households, including five rich peasant households, three middle peasant households, seventeen poor peasant households, and two destitute households. Although hired and poor peasants gained some land and housing in last year's land reform, they received very little livestock and other property, while the rich peasant Song Qunming's family still owns two head of livestock. The poor peasant Zhang Deshun doesn't even have one leg [of livestock]. During the spring plowing season, rich and middle peasants had livestock to plow the land, prepared seeds early, and transplanted seedlings well, resulting in larger grain yields in the autumn. When plowing the autumn fallow land, the middle peasants completed all their plowing, but poor peasants like Zhang Deshun were unable to plow at all due to the lack of livestock and high livestock wages (earning 1.3 *dou* of rice per day of plowing). Because of a lack of labor, military dependent Song Likai and three others delayed sowing in the spring and did not transplant seedlings properly. They only weeded once in the summer, and the beans were not weeded at all. As a result, in the autumn, two *mu* of millet yielded 1.5 *shi*, and six *mu* of beans yielded 0.3 *shi*. After paying public grain and wages, they now have nothing to eat. They could not afford to pay wages in the autumn, so all the land was left unplowed, and it is even more impossible to carry out production in the winter. Because the village's policy for preferential treatment of military dependents is to provide twelve workdays of preferential treatment to each household, regardless of labor availability and whether they are rich, middle, hired, or poor military dependents, the rich peasant Song Nanzhi sent his son to join the army because he feared peasant struggle. He received preferential treatment this year, and he also owns livestock. He plowed early in the spring, prepared seeds early, and transplanted seedlings well, resulting in a large grain harvest in the autumn. Seven *mu* of millet yielded 4.57 *shi*, and seven *mu* of beans yielded 1.7 *shi*. He also earned a lot of wage rice when sowing wheat, and he also has shares in the cooperative. He now has food and drink and is engaged in winter production. Most of the cooperative's shares are owned by rich and middle peasants, and hired and poor peasants do not receive loans or dividends. According to village cadres, hired and poor peasants did not have money to invest when shares were collected, and the hired peasant Song Kuima wanted to invest two *dou* of sorghum, but the cooperative refused because it does not accept grain. The village has been organizing winter production work for half a month, but the group of seventeen poor peasant households and two destitute households have not yet figured out how to carry out production. In Heba Village, apart from households of old middle peasants and a few cadres who have ways to carry out winter production, most of the remaining poor peasants not only lack money for production, but more than a dozen hired and poor peasants, such as Zhao Heshang, do not even have rice to eat. The poor peasant Zhao Sanfang harvested a total of two *shi* of grain, and after repaying debts and paying public grain, he only has two *dou* of mung beans left. The hired laborer Zhao Heshang, after paying public grain and wages for land cultivation, also has no rice to cook. He plans to sell the two pairs of cabinets that he gained as a result of the struggle last year, but he cannot find a buyer, so he despondently said, "I only have one way to die!"

An examination of the reasons for neglecting the hired and poor peasants: (1) Most of the money gained from struggle during the land reform was used to buy goods and resell them to everyone, so many poor peasants did not have money to buy them, and the fruits of the struggle were taken away by households of middle peasants and above. For example, in Heba Village, 270,000 yuan was gained from the struggle during last year's land reform. The hired and poor peasants demanded distribution at the time, but the cadres said it could not be done, saying that they needed to buy livestock. This year, they bought eleven head of livestock from Yueyang, and the cadres stipulated that they should be sold to the masses at half price, but the hired and poor peasants could not afford even half price, and all eleven head of livestock were bought by households of middle peasants and above. During the Three Autumns campaign, the village cadres and middle and rich peasants decided that each head of livestock would earn 1.3 *dou* of rice per day of plowing. The poor peasants gritted their teeth and paid wages to sow wheat, while the middle and above peasants earned a large amount of wage rice at this time. When plowing the fallow land, households with livestock wanted to earn wages again, but the hired and poor peasants could not afford it. Therefore, no matter how the government called for autumn plowing, 200 *mu* of land in the village remains unplowed. The ground is now frozen, and the hired and poor peasants urgently demand winter production, but the village cadres are forcing them to plow the land in order to complete the autumn plowing task. For example, the poor peasant Zhang Deshun in Lingtou Village earns a living by selling snacks at the Donggou market every day because he harvested too little grain, but the village cadres forced him to come back and plow the land in order to complete the autumn plowing task. Zhang Deshun said angrily, "I couldn't afford to plow when I could, but now that the ground is frozen, you are forcing me to plow. This is really killing me!" (2) Although cadres at all levels have also emphasized organizing hired and poor peasant groups to solve the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants, they have not seriously gone into the hired and poor peasant class to understand their difficulties and solve them. For example, the village cadres and mutual aid group leaders in Jiaquan, Heba, Lingtou, and other villages are mostly controlled by middle peasants and rich peasants. It is not that the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants are too many to solve, but that they simply do not see the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants. It has been half a month since the Third District arranged for winter production, but some district cadres, such as the vice chairman of the District Peasants' Association, Wang Wenguang, went home to see [their families] before going to the countryside. As of December 8th, he had not yet gone to the key village. The hired and poor peasants of the Second Mutual Aid Group in Heba Village gritted their teeth and gathered all their grain to open a restaurant at the Donggou market in order to carry out winter production. On the 6th, everything was ready, but the house was occupied by the Third District Office that night. The house was originally the fruit of the masses' struggle, but the district office did not care about these things and told the village's political director, "The public needs to use it. Tell them to find another way to open the restaurant!" The hired and poor peasants were discouraged after hearing these words and said, "It's difficult to produce no matter what we think of!" (3) Because the district emphasized the call for villages to learn from the Yuneng "Three-Combination" mutual aid society when arranging winter production and universally organize "Three-Combination" mutual aid societies, each village challenged each other in competition: to set up "Three-Combination" mutual aid societies in ten and a half days. Therefore, the village cadres in each village ordered the organization of "Three-Combination" mutual aid, and no one could go out to engage in production. Serious formalism is at work. For example, when three people from Heba Village went out to mend leaky pots, the village cadres knew about it and said, "The 'Three-Combination' mutual aid group has not yet been organized. Who will go to do errands if you leave?" Therefore, many hired and poor peasants still remain in the village, holding meetings every night to discuss the organization of "Three-Combination" mutual aid groups; (4) Because the coordination of cadres in various systems is insufficient, such as the bank wanting to lend money to hired and poor peasants, but because hired and poor peasant groups have not yet been organized, the bank cannot lend money on the one hand and must recover old loans and reissue them on the other, so it cannot start. According to bank comrades, the Third District's winter loans are 23 million yuan, but the loans that each village has taken out in the past, led by cadres or mutual aid groups and cooperatives, are nearly 30 million yuan. Old loans must be recovered before new loans can be given to hired and poor peasants. Now the village cadres are afraid that they will not be able to get loans in the future, so they are deliberately delaying the repayment time. For example, the Xilingtou Cooperative deliberately prolonged the repayment time, saying, "The people have already taken the money to produce, and it cannot be recovered now!" Or they say, "We have already transferred the loans to hired and poor peasants!" In fact, a few people are manipulating the loans for production. If these problems are not solved in time, then time will pass quickly, and the 20 million yuan loan will not reach the hired and poor peasants. In short, the hired and poor peasants have many difficulties in winter production. If these difficulties are not solved quickly and seriously, then the hired and poor peasants will not be able to carry out winter production, let alone take the lead in winter production.

### 区村干部忘了本  雇贫困难不关心  晋城三区生产调查

    区村干部忘了本
    雇贫困难不关心
    晋城三区生产调查
    【本报太岳十五日电】晋城今年由于水旱二灾，普遍歉收，除二、五区部分村秋收八成外，全县大部为三至四成收，特别是三区窑头、庾能、贺跋、岭头等村收成更少，庾能村除交纳公粮外，每人平均九斗杂粮，配上糠菜才可吃到阴历年底，窑头等村每人平均只有四斗杂粮，不到年底就无吃的，最困难者是雇贫农，他们不但没有钱和牲口搞生产，目下就没有吃用。根据三区贺跋、岭头、贾泉等村调查，发现雇贫农在冬季生产中的种种困难，真是不深入雇贫阶层所难想象的。
    西岭头村互助组第二组共二十七户，其中有五户富农、三户中农、十七户贫农、两户赤贫，由于去年土改中雇贫农得到一些土地、房屋，牲口及其他财物分得很少，而富农宋群明一家却喂着两头牲口，贫农张得顺却连一条腿也没有。春耕时，富农与中农有牲口犁地，养种早，捉苗好，因此秋天产粮也多。秋垡地时，中农全部垡完，贫农张得顺等因没牲口与牲口工资太高（该村每犋牲口犁一天地赚米一斗三升），就全部没垡。贫农军属宋理开等四人，因无劳力，春天养种迟，苗未捉好，夏天只锄了一遍，豆子根本没锄，所以秋天二亩谷打一石五斗，六亩豆子打三斗，除交纳公粮与付工资外，现在就无吃的，秋天因出不起工资，地便全部未垡，冬季更无法进行生产。因为该村优待军属办法是，不论有无劳力，不论富、中、雇、贫军属，皆一律每户优待十二个工，富农宋南制因为怕农民斗争就送子参军，今年得到优待，自己又喂有牲口，春天犁地养种早，捉苗好，秋天收粮多，七亩谷子打四石五斗七升，七亩豆子打一石七斗，种麦子时又赚了许多工资米，合作社也入有股金，现在有吃有喝的进行冬季生产。该村合作社股金大部为富农与中农所有，贷款与分红雇贫农没有份，据村干部谈，当时集股雇贫农没有钱入，雇农宋魁马想入二斗高粱，但合作社规定不收粮食，被拒绝了。今年该村布置冬季生产工作已经半月，全组十七户贫农与两户赤贫，还未想出生产办法来。贺跋村除老中农以上户与几家干部有办法进行冬季生产外，其余大部贫农不但没有钱生产，并且赵和尚等十几户雇贫，眼前就没米吃，贫农赵三方共打两石粮食，除还人家与交公粮外，仅余二斗绿豆。雇工赵和尚，除交公粮与种地工资外，现也无米下锅，他计划将去年得斗争果实的两对柜子卖掉，也找不到顾主，于是他丧气的说：“我只有死路一条！”
    检查这些忽视雇贫的原因：（一）土改中斗争出的钱，大部分都是买回东西来再转卖给大家，因此，许多贫农没有钱买，于是斗争果实就被中农以上户得去了。如贺跋村在去年土改时斗争出二十七万元，雇贫农当时要求分配，干部说不能，说要买牲口。今年到岳阳买回十一头牲口，干部又规定半价卖给群众，但雇贫农就连半价也出不起，十一头牲口都被中农以上户买去了。三秋运动中，村干部与中、富农决定，每犋牲口犁一天地，工资一斗三升米，贫农咬紧牙关拿出工资种上麦子，而中农以上户却在这时赚了大批工资。垡地时有牲口户还想再赚工资，但雇贫农却拿不出来了。因此，不管政府如何号召秋垡，该村现在仍有二百亩地未垡。目前地已上冻，雇贫农迫切要求冬季生产，而村干部为了完成秋垡任务，又迫着雇贫垡地。如岭头村贫农张得顺，因打的粮食太少，每天在东沟集上卖小食糊嘴，而村干部为着要完成秋垡任务，便硬迫他回来垡地，气得张得顺说：“能垡的时候我垡不起，现在地冻了，你们又迫着我垡，真是活杀人啦！”（二）虽然各级干部也强调组织雇贫小组，解决雇贫困难，但却没有认真深入雇贫中去了解他们的困难与解决他们的困难。如贾泉、贺跋、岭头等村的村干部及互助组长，大部为中农与富农掌握，他们并非因为雇贫困难多难解决，而是根本看不到雇贫的困难。三区布置冬季生产已半月，部分区干部，如区农会副主席王文光，却先回家看看再下乡，直至十二月八日，还未下到基点村。贺跋村互助第二组雇贫农，为了搞冬季生产，咬着牙将所有粮食都集起来，准备到东沟集上开饭铺。六日，一切皆准备好，但房子却在当夜被三区区公所占用。该房原为群众斗争果实，而区公所不管这些事，却给该村政治主任说：“公家要借用，开饭铺叫他们另想办法吧！”这些雇贫听到这种话后，灰心丧气的说：“想什么办法也难生产！”（三）由于区上布置冬季生产时，强调号召各村学习庾能“三合”互助社，普遍组织“三合”互助社，因此，各村皆挑战竞赛：要在十天半月中搞起“三合”互助。于是各村村干部都下命令组织“三合”互助，谁也不能出去搞生产。严重的形式主义在作怪。如贺跋村有三个人出去锢漏锅，村干部知道了说：“还没有组织‘三合’互助组，你们走了谁去支差？”所以，许多雇贫农仍然停留在村里，每天夜间开会讨论组织“三合”互助组；（四）由于各系统干部配合不够，如银行要贷款给雇贫，但因目前未组织起雇贫小组，银行一面无法贷款，一面还要收回旧款重新发放，所以无法下手。据银行同志谈，三区冬季贷款为二千三百万元，但各村过去以干部为首或互助组、合作社贷款已将近三千万元，必须收回旧款才能贷给雇贫农。现在各村干部惟恐将来贷不上款，故意在拖延归还时间。如西岭头合作社，故意拉长归还旧款时间说：“老百姓已拿款去生产去了，当下收不回来！”或者说：“我们已经将贷款转给雇贫了！”实际上是少数人操纵着贷款生产。这些问题如不及时解决，则时间很快过去，两千万贷款便不能达到雇贫手里。总之，雇贫在冬季生产中的困难很多，若不迅速认真的解决，则雇贫农就无法进行冬季生产，更谈不上雇贫在冬季生产中来带头。
