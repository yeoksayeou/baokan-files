[This report from the JiluYu Main Branch on the 22nd] Qingfeng various districts are issuing loans to support farmers in developing sideline production. Since March of this year, each district has established loan offices and identified 26 key villages, organizing 106 mutual aid groups. A total of 54,117,000 yuan in loans has been issued, benefiting 2,369 poor peasant households and 608 middle peasant households. As a result, each district has obtained significant profits from sideline occupations. For example, in Houwan Village in the Fourth District, grinding flour, in addition to providing for the family and accumulating manure, each share received a dividend of 8,000 yuan in just two months. This village experienced a late rainy season this spring, and the masses, having experienced starvation in famine years, were unusually panicked. Only after a village-wide meeting was held did they begin to cooperate in grinding flour. At that time, only 290,000 yuan was raised in loans to purchase a donkey, four piglets, and the remainder was used as capital. Accounts were settled monthly. In the first month, the profit was 180,000 yuan, and over 40 cartloads of fertilizer were accumulated. Each share received enough flour paste and flour residue daily to support one person. The second settlement earned a profit of 205,000 yuan, accumulating over 50 cartloads of fertilizer and raising four fat pigs. In the most recent two months, the total net profit was 440,000 yuan, and over 90 large cartloads of fertilizer were accumulated. Including the fat pigs and flour paste, the total was equivalent to 324,000 yuan. Adding the previous earnings, the total amounted to 984,000 yuan. Now, four additional shuttle machines are being renovated in preparation for establishing a women's weaving group. The entire village is also preparing to grind tofu, make baked wheaten cakes, and open a dyeing workshop. The enthusiasm of the masses is extremely high.

[Another report] In Huangchanghu Village in the Seventh District, the mutual aid groups have shown great enthusiasm in combining sideline production. The entire village has five manure basket weaving groups, among which the Huang Chunmei group has performed the best, earning over 450,000 yuan in the two months from the fifteenth of the eighth lunar month to the middle of the tenth lunar month. Now, a large cellar with three rooms has been dug, and the production enthusiasm is very high.

[This report from the JiluYu Main Branch on the 22nd] The Puyang Fifth District Loan Office is vigorously supporting poor peasants in resolving difficulties in sideline production. In Hushan Village, 160 households formed six mutual aid groups during the wheat harvest season, each group consisting of 13 to 17 households. Some poor peasants, although they had obtained land, lacked livestock and farm tools. Therefore, the production loan office lent them 220,000 yuan to purchase five cattle, two donkeys, and necessary farm tools, resolving the difficulties of livestock and farm tools. After the wheat harvest, each group repaid the previous loans. To support poor peasants in sideline production, the loan office lent another 250,000 yuan to four transportation groups, including Li Yulin and Li Shang, to transport bowls and black alum to Pengcheng. Bowls could earn a profit equal to the principal, and black alum could earn a profit of 80 percent. After repaying the principal and interest of the loans, the net profit was 1,025,000 yuan. In addition to providing for the living expenses of these four groups, it could also be used as transportation capital. There are plans to solve the land burden in sideline production in the future. Under the influence of these four groups, two groups in the village, Li Jingdong and Li Decun, also borrowed 200,000 yuan from the loan office to engage in sideline production.

　　清丰濮阳发贷款扶植群众闹副业
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】清丰各区贷款扶植农民副业生产。自今年三月间，各区成立贷款所，并研究确定重点村廿六个，组织互助组一零六个，共贷款五千四百十一万七千元，贫农二千三百六十九户，得到贷款，中农六百零八户得到贷款，各区都因此在副业上获得很大利润，仅四区后万家村搞磨粉，除养家积粪外，两个月每股即批得红利八千元。该村今年春天落雨比较晚，群众有灾荒年饿死人的经验，所以异常恐慌，当经全村大会研究才互助起来磨粉，当时仅贷款集股二十九万元，除买驴一头、买小猪四个外，余均做为资金，每月结帐一次，第一月赚利十八万，积肥四十余车，每股每天批粉糊涂及粉渣能够一人生活。第二次结帐赚利二十万五千元积肥五十担余车，养肥猪四口。最近两个月合计净赚利四十四万元，积肥九十余大车，连肥猪、粉糊涂共折算三十二万四千元，连前所赚，共合洋九十八万四千元。现又改造拉梭机四张，准备成立妇女纺织组，全村又准备磨豆腐、打烧饼、开染坊，群众情绪极高。
    【又讯】七区黄昌湖村，互助组结合副业生产劲头很大，全村共有五个编粪箕组，其中以黄春梅组搞的最好，自阴历八月十五至十月中旬两个月来，赚了四十五万余元。现在又挖了三间大的一个地窖，生产劲很大。
    【本报冀鲁豫廿二日电】濮阳五区贷款所，大力扶植贫农解决副业生产中的困难。虎山寨村一百六十户，在麦收时期成立了六个互助组，每组十三户至十七户，有些贫农虽然得到土地，缺乏牲口和农具，于是生产贷款所贷给他们廿二万元，买了五头牛、两头驴和必用的农具，解决了牲口和农具的困难。麦后每组将过去贷款归还，贷款所为扶植贫农副业生产，又贷款二十五万元给李玉林、李尚等四个运输组，赴彭城拉碗和黑矾，碗能赚对本，黑矾能赚百分之八十，除把贷的款本利归还，净得红利一百零二万五千元，除能供给这四个组的生活费外，还能做运输资本，现正计划将来地亩负担要在副业生产中解决。在这四个组的影响下，该村李敬东、李德村两个组，也从贷款所里贷款二十万元搞副业生产。
