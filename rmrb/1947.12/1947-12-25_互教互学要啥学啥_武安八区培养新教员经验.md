　　Mutual Teaching and Mutual Learning: Learning What's Needed
  　Wu'an Eighth District Cultivates New Teacher Experience
    [Report from this newspaper, Wu'an] After rectification by the Wu'an education department, a group of emancipated peasant teachers were brought in. These teachers had low levels of education and little experience. The county planned to hold teacher training classes in districts to improve the new teachers' cultural level. The following are a few experiences from the Eighth District:
    (1) Everyone Discusses What is Needed and Learns What is Needed: In the Eighth District, out of fifty-three teachers, thirty-one were from emancipated households and twenty-two were new middle peasants (those who rose in status during the Anti-Japanese War). Because they were poor in the past, they had not attended much school. Everyone felt that the most difficult thing was written arithmetic, followed by geography and general knowledge of reading newspapers. Some couldn't even understand the newspapers. Some could understand the newspapers, but didn't know where some place names were. They also proposed learning punctuation marks, using dictionaries, and so on. Therefore, the leadership, with the attitude of "giving what is needed," researched the courses proposed by everyone in advance and began learning in a planned way.
    (2) Organize a Learning Committee for Mutual Teaching and Mutual Learning: In order to launch a mass self-study upsurge, it was decided to use the "large segment system" of teaching, learning one thing at a time, those who knew teaching those who didn't, mutual teaching and mutual learning, with self-study as the main focus, and senior elementary school cadres providing guidance. For example, when learning arithmetic, because the levels were uneven, it was divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Those who knew taught those who didn't. If Class C couldn't understand, Class B would teach them. If Class B couldn't understand, Class A would teach them. If Class A had problems, the learning committee would study and solve them together. Everyone was both a teacher and a student, and their enthusiasm was very high. When learning geography, they first drew an outline of a map of China, explaining directions and locations. When learning the names of provinces, they filled in the names of each province, and then filled in the abbreviations of the provincial capitals. When learning about mountain ranges, they drew the mountain ranges. After learning, the map was also filled. To make it easier for everyone to remember, the abbreviations of the provinces were compiled into a rhythmic jingle, making it easy for everyone to sing and remember.
    (3) Study Land Reform and Clarify Class Standpoint: After everyone studied cultural courses, they took two days to study land reform. The leadership found two comrades who were good at exposing their thoughts and made a speech at a general meeting to encourage everyone to speak boldly and expose all kinds of thoughts. Some were afraid of a change in the political climate, and some were sitting on two boats. After everyone's criticism and discussion, they realized their class standpoint and proposed to resolutely separate from the landlords.
    (4) Convene a Joint Meeting of Cadres and Teachers: In order to ensure that this group of teachers would work smoothly after going down and to change the views of individual villages that looked down on emancipated peasant teachers, the joint meeting method was used. Villages where the relationship between cadres and teachers was good talked about their experiences, and both sides in villages where the relationship was not good also made self-criticisms, explaining that today's teachers are one of us and should help and cooperate with each other in the future, and so on. After seventeen days of learning, everyone felt that the time was short but the results were great.

　　互教互学要啥学啥
  　武安八区培养新教员经验
    【本报武安讯】武安教育部门经过整顿后，换上一批翻身教员，这批教员文化程度低、经验少，县里有计划的分区召开教员训练班，提高新教员的文化。兹将八区的几点经验介绍如下：
    （一）大家讨论需要啥学啥：八区五十三个教员，有三十一个翻身户，有二十二个新中农（抗战期间上升者），因为过去家穷都没有上过啥学，大家感觉到最困难的就是笔算，其次就是地理和读报常识，有的还看不通报。有的看通报了，有些地名不知道在那里。另外还提出学标点符号、查字典等等要求。所以领导上就以要啥给啥的态度，把大家提出来的课程，事先研究了一下，有计划的开始了学习。
    （二）组织学委会互教互学：为发动群众性的自学热潮，决定用“大段制”的教学法，学了一样学一样，会的教不会的，互教互学，以自学为主，高小干部做辅导。如学算术时因为程度不齐，就划了甲乙丙三班，会的教不会的，丙班搞不通，叫乙班来教，乙班搞不通甲班来教，甲班不会的问题有学委会大家来研究解决。大家又是先生又是学生，情绪非常高涨。学地理时先画一张轮廓的中国地图，说明方向和位置；学省名时、即填上各省的名字，然后再填上省会简称，讲山脉时画上山脉，学完了也画满了。为了使大家好记，把各省的简称编成快板，使大家又好唱，又好记。
    （三）学习土地改革、明确阶级立场：大家学习了文化课以后，又抽出两天时间学习土改，领导上找出两个暴露思想好的同志作了一个大会发言，启发大家大胆发言，暴露出各种各样的思想。有的是怕变天，有的是脚蹬两只船，经过大家的批评讨论，才认识了阶级立场，提出坚决和地主分家。
    （四）召开干部教员联席会：为了使这批教员下去以后工作顺利，转变个别村庄看不起翻身教员观点。用联席会方式，把干部教员关系好的村庄谈了谈，关系不好的双方也检讨了一下，说明今天的教员和我们是一家人，今后应该互相帮助、互相配合等等。经过十七天的学习，大家都感觉到时间短、成绩大。
