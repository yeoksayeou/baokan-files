Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: According to Shanghai press reports, the victorious counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army and the activity of people's armed forces in various places have caused extreme panic among the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities. In the middle of last month, they successively convened the Central China "Six-Province Joint Defense Conference" and the South China "Guangdong-Guangxi Two-Province Pacification Conference" to discuss defense countermeasures. The former decided that the six provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi should implement the so-called "joint defense" and "wartime system." A "Ministry of National Defense Central China Command Post" was established in Jiujiang, commanding the area south of the Huai River, north of the Yangtze River, west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and east of the Pinghan Railway. This command post is presided over by Bai Chongxi, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Minister of National Defense, and has recently been moved to Hankou. South of the Yangtze River, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are building bunkers everywhere, while the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are under armed guard. In South China, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces are also hastily organizing so-called "People's Self-Defense Forces" and "Suppression of Rebellion Mobilization Committees," further exploiting the people's blood, sweat, and lives in a vain attempt to suppress the rapidly expanding people's armed forces in Guangdong and Guangxi. In the above two conferences, the extreme panic of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities and their complete lack of confidence in the future have been fully exposed. At the "Central China Six-Province Joint Defense Conference," the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek and the chairmen of various provinces expressed fear of the powerful people's armed forces in Jiangnan and admitted that not only do the broad masses of peasants support the people's armed forces by supplying grain and grass and passing on intelligence, but also local intellectuals and even some township and village chiefs and gentry are in contact with the people's armed forces and provide cover for them. Chiang Kai-shek can only console himself with thunderous anger and so-called "deadline for suppression" orders in response to this "bad" situation. Song Ziwen, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit governor of Guangdong Province, also issued a lament at the "Guangdong-Guangxi Pacification Conference," admitting that "bandit" (referring to people's armed forces) forces are spreading everywhere in Guangdong and Guangxi. When Huang Xuchu, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit governor of Guangxi Province, arrived in Guangdong for the meeting, he told reporters as soon as he got off the plane: "The security situation in Guangxi Province is no longer what it used to be. Sixteen counties have experienced riots this year, and tax collection will face major difficulties in the future."

　　我军胜利反攻江南民军活跃
  　蒋匪手忙脚乱没办法
  　召开各种会议空喊情势不佳
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据沪报消息：人民解放军的胜利反攻及各地人民武装之活跃，已使蒋匪当局惊恐万状，于上月中一连召开华中“六省联防会议”及华南“粤、桂两省绥靖会议”，商讨防御对策。前者决定豫、苏、皖、鄂、湘、赣等六省实行所谓“联防”及“战时体制”。在九江设立“国防部华中指挥所”，将淮河以南，长江以北，津浦路以西，平汉路以东的地区为其指挥，该指挥所由蒋匪国防部长白崇禧主持，该指挥所近已移至汉口。长江以南，蒋匪到处修筑碉堡，京沪、沪杭两线则实行武装警卫。华南粤、桂二省也急忙组织所谓“民众自卫队”与“勘乱动员委员会”，进一步向人民榨取血汗与生命，妄图镇压猛烈扩大中的两广人民武装。在上述两次会议中，蒋匪当局之极度恐慌与对前途之毫无信心，已暴露无遗。在“华中六省联防会议”上，匪首蒋介石及其各省主席对江南强大之人民武装均表示畏惧，并承认：不仅广大农民支援人民武装，供给粮草，传递情报，即地方知识分子、甚至有些乡保甲长与士绅，亦均与人民武装联系，并代为掩护。蒋介石对此“恶劣”局面，只有以大发雷霆及所谓“限期肃清”的命令来聊以自慰。蒋匪粤省主席宋子文在“粤、桂绥靖会议”上，亦发出哀鸣，承认：“粤、桂‘匪’（指人民武装）势到处蔓延”。蒋匪广西省主席黄旭初抵粤开会时，刚下飞机即对记者说：“桂省治安情形已今非昔比，今年十六县发生暴动，以后征粮征税将遭遇重大困难”。
