　　Cross River Textile Loans Given to Landlords to Smoke Cigarettes

    [Our Newspaper Ping Shun News] In our inspection of loans, we found that due to a lack of class perspective, many biases were created, and no attention was paid to helping poor peasants and farmhands solve their production difficulties. For example, in the first team of Zhao Cheng Village, of the twenty-five households that received textile loans, old middle peasants accounted for thirteen households, accounting for 52% of the loan recipients, while new middle peasants accounted for only twelve households, accounting for only 48%. In terms of loan amounts, old middle peasants accounted for 51.8%, while new middle peasants accounted for 48.2%. Another example is Da Shi Tou River Village, which gave old middle peasants Li Gouze, Yang Wanfu, and others 800 yuan each, asking women to buy cotton for textile use, but the money was not used for production; instead, they spent it on buying salt and oil. Even worse, in Cross River Village, 70,000 yuan in textile loans were distributed evenly this spring, without truly distinguishing based on class composition. Instead, landlords Su Qunxing, Su Fazeng, and Li Yuanqin, who had been struggled against by the masses, were each given loans of 1,500 yuan, and they ended up smoking cigarettes and squandering the money. In the past, when we inspected loans, we often only focused on the use and production profits of the borrowers, without truly strictly inspecting from a class perspective. This is the main reason for the biases. The above proves that our loans must establish a class line and truly lend to liberated peasants. As the saying goes, "A newly rich household is not as good as a bankrupt landlord." It is also important to help them well, so that loans can exert their enormous power on the production front. In order to do a good job in winter production, we must conduct three inspections in the future: inspect class, inspect use, and inspect production profits. The whole county is now carrying out universal re-lending and loan inspection to cooperatives. (Hebei Xingtai Ping Shun Branch Correspondent Group Xiang Rong)

　　十字河纺织贷款贷给地主吸纸烟
    【本报平顺讯】我们在检查贷款中，发现由于缺乏阶级观点，造成不少偏向，没有注意帮助贫雇解决生产困难。如赵城村第一大队，贷纺织款的二十五户，旧中农就占十三户，占贷户的百分之五十二，新中农十二户，才占百分之四十八。从贷款金额上看，旧中农占百分之五十一点八，新中农占百分之四十八点二。又如大石头河村给旧中农李狗则、杨万富等每人贷款八百元，叫妇女买花纺织用，结果没用于生产上，买盐打油胡花了。更糟糕的是十字河村，今春贷纺织款七万元，是平均分配的，没真正从阶级成份上分别看待，竟给被群众斗争过的苏群兴、苏法增、李元琴等三个地主每人贷款千五百元，结果他们把钱吸纸烟瞎胡花了。以前我们检查贷款，往往只是从贷户的用途和生产获利上来打圈子，没真正从阶级观点来严格检查，这是造成偏向的主要原因。由以上证明，我们的贷款必须树立阶级路线，把贷款真正贷到翻身农民手里，俗话说：新发户不如个破财主。还得很好帮助，使贷款在生产战线上发挥它巨大的力量。为了把冬季生产搞好，我们今后查贷，也必须进行三查：查阶级、查用途、查生产利润。现全县正进行普遍给合作社转贷与查贷中。（冀行平支通讯组祥荣）
