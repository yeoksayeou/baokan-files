Red and White Sugar
　　Peking University Makes the Best

　　[This Newspaper] Our region's sugar beet production has been successfully tested through the painstaking research of the Sugar Production Group of the Agricultural College of Peking University and the Changzhi and Handan farms. Judging from the current sugar products, the red and white sugar produced by the Agricultural College of Peking University is the best. The college's white sugar factory has been formally established in Changzhi. The sugar produced by the Changzhi and Handan farms has also greatly improved compared with last year. The sugar produced last year had a bitter taste, but this year, through diligent refining, the bitter taste has been eliminated. Sugar is a major import commodity in our region, with estimated annual imports exceeding 100 million yuan. The successful trial production is a major achievement in the productive enterprise of our border region. According to researchers, sugar beets (i.e., sugar radishes) can yield 3,000 to 5,000 catties per mu (irrigated land), and every 7 to 12 catties can produce 1 catty of sugar, so one mu of land can produce 300 to 500 catties of sugar. In order to promote the development of the sugar industry in the border region and further improve sugar production technology, next year the Border Region Government will cooperate with the Agricultural College of Peking University to promote a plan to plant 10,000 mu of sugar beets. It also plans to focus on disseminating sugar production technology in the rural areas of Changzhi, Xiangyuan, Lucheng, Licheng, Shexian, Wu'an, Handan, Cixian, and other places next spring, and organize sugar industry cooperatives.

　　红白糖
  　北大做的顶好
    【本报讯】我区甜菜制糖，经北大农学院制糖组及长治、邯郸农场之苦心研究，已经试验成功。从目前糖之产品来看，以北大农学院出产之红白糖为最好，该院之白糖制造厂，已于长治正式成立。长治邯郸农场所产之糖也较去年有很大进步，去年产糖带有苦味，今年努力精制，苦味已消除。按砂糖为我区一大入口货，估计每年入超约在十万万元以上，今试制成功，实为我边区生产事业之一大收获。据研究者谈，甜菜（即糖萝卜）每亩（水地）可收三千斤至五千斤，每七斤至十二斤可出糖一斤，则一亩地可出糖三百斤至五百斤。为推广边区糖业发展，及进一步改进制糖技术，明年边府将与北大农学院合作，推动发展一万亩甜菜播种计划，并拟于明春首先在长治、襄垣、潞城、黎城、涉县、武安、邯郸、磁县等地农村中，有重点的传播制糖技术。组织糖业合作。　（边府建设厅）
