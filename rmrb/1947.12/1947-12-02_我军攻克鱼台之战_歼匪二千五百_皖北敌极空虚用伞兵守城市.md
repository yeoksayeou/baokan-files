Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 30th. Detailed battle results from the Liberation Army's capture of Yutai on the 19th, after investigation, show a total of over 2,500 enemies annihilated, including the capture of over 1,000 Chiang bandits, including Wu Pinshan, the Yutai County Magistrate and concurrently head of the Security Regiment, and over 500 members of the Home Return Corps. Over a hundred were killed or wounded. Seized were over 700 rifles, 34 light and heavy machine guns, 3 mortars, 16 grenade launchers, an ammunition depot, and a batch of other military supplies. At the same time, two battalions and a heavy artillery company of the 70th Division of the enemy coming to the rescue from Jinxiang, and two more companies of the Security Regiment were completely wiped out, capturing Liu Huang, deputy regimental commander with the rank of Major of the 278th Regiment and over 600 others, killing over 300, seizing over 300 long and short guns, 33 light and heavy machine guns, 14 large and small guns, 20 grenade launchers, 20 boxes of shells, over 105,000 rounds of ammunition, and a batch of other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, E-Yu-Wan Front, 30th. The Liberation Army, in conjunction with the people's armed forces in various parts of western Anhui, actively suppressed bandits. From the 21st to the 24th, in the Peijiagang area, 20 miles east of Lujiang County, seven Chiang bandit township offices were annihilated, killing over 30 bandits, capturing over 150, and seizing over 90 long and short guns. On the 24th, at Liujiahe, 30 miles north of Taihu County, a Chiang bandit security squad was routed, capturing 36, including the squad leader, and seizing 39 long and short guns, and over 2,000 rounds of ammunition. Another unit, on the 25th, at Huangwei River, 60 miles west of Yuexi County, annihilated 110 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, killing over 30 on the spot, capturing over 70, and seizing 80 long and short guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Chiang bandit forces are so weak that even the Chiang bandit paratrooper units, trained by the American imperialists and usually only used as window dressing, have been forced to be transferred to the army to defend cities. According to the Chiang bandit Bengbu Northern Anhui Daily of October 28th, Lingbi in northern Anhui is defended by a Chiang bandit paratrooper brigade. On the same day, the newspaper admitted that the Chiang bandit local teams and regimes in northern Anhui had been almost completely wiped out by our Chen and Su armies. The newspaper stated: "The self-defense forces of various counties, with the exception of Fuyang which is relatively complete, have been almost entirely destroyed." After our army liberated Mengcheng County, the Chiang bandits "not only did the local teams lose confidence and faith, and were destroyed beyond repair, exposing military weaknesses without reservation, but also in the political aspect, the organization disintegrated, and the (Chiang bandit) government lost its leadership and control. The (Chiang bandit) county government, every night, led the remaining teams to quietly withdraw from the county seat in order to ensure their own safety, terrified and frightened, like birds startled by a bow." When our army liberated Taihe, the Chiang bandit "Police First Brigade and Direct Brigade were completely scattered, the brigade commander Fan Xianchen and the deputy commander and direct brigade commander Hu Haitian were missing. The sixth company commander of the Police Second Brigade was injured, and the training officer was killed in action. Now most of the local armed companies have been completely wiped out. All 34 township and village public offices have been destroyed." The Chiang bandit local teams have no will to fight. When our army swept through the counties of northern Anhui, the Chiang bandit "self-defense" forces mostly withdrew from the county seats a few days in advance (same newspaper, October 16th).

　　我军攻克鱼台之战
  　歼匪二千五百
    皖北敌极空虚用伞兵守城市
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线三十日电】解放军十九日攻克鱼台之役详细战果，经查明共歼敌两千五百余，计俘蒋匪鱼台县长兼保安团长吴品山以下千余名，及还乡团五百余人，毙伤其百余人，缴获步枪七百余枝，轻重机枪三十四挺，迫击炮三门，掷弹筒十六个，弹药库一座及其他军用品一批。同时，全歼自金乡出援敌七十师之两个营及一个重炮连，另保安团两个连，俘二七八团少校团副刘璜以下六百余人，毙三百余名，缴获长短枪三百余枝，轻重机枪三十三挺，大小炮十四门，掷弹筒二十个，炮弹二十箱，子弹十万五千余发，及其他军用品一批。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线三十日电】解放军结合皖西各地人民武装积极剿匪，二十一至二十四日在卢江县城以东二十里之裴家岗地区，歼灭蒋匪七个乡公所，计毙匪三十余名，俘一百五十余名，缴长短枪九十余枝。二十四日在太湖县城以北三十里之刘家河，击溃蒋匪一个保安中队，俘中队长以下三十六名，缴长短枪三十九枝，子弹两千余发。另一部于二十五日在岳西县城以西六十里之黄尾河，歼灭蒋记土匪一百一十名，当场毙击三十余名，俘七十余名，缴长短枪八十枝。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】蒋匪兵力空虚，甚至由美帝训练一向仅充作装点门面用的蒋匪伞兵部队，亦被迫移充陆军作防御城市。据蒋匪蚌埠皖北日报十月二十八日报导，皖北灵璧由蒋匪伞兵一个总队防守。同日，该报供认皖北蒋匪地方团队、政权为我陈、粟大军扫荡殆尽，该报称：“各县自卫武力，除阜阳比较完整外，其余几全被摧毁。”我军一度解放蒙城县城后，蒋匪“不惟地方团队失去自信，失去信仰，摧毁无余，不堪收拾，军事弱点暴露无遗。即政治方面，亦组织解体，（蒋匪）政府失去领导力量，失去统驭的效能。（蒋匪）县政府则每于夜间，率带残余团队，悄然撤离县城，以图己身安全，丧魂失魄，如同惊弓之鸟。”我军解放太和时，蒋匪“保警第一大队及直属大队全部溃散，大队长樊贤臣、总队附兼直属大队长胡海天生死不明。保警第二大队第六中队长受伤，训练员阵亡，现地方武力各中队多已全部荡然。三十四乡镇保公所均被摧毁。”蒋匪地方团队士无斗志，我军扫荡皖北各县时，蒋匪“自卫”武力大多于前数日即撤离县城（十月十六日同报）。
