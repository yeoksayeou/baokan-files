	Recent News on Production and Construction in Northeast China

	The Liaobei Provincial Government allocated 30 million yuan to begin repairs on the Kailu Heilong Dam on November 1st, which was destroyed by the Japanese invaders before "August 15th." The plan is to complete 20,000 to 30,000 labor days before the freezing period, and another 50,000 labor days after the thaw next year. After completion, it is estimated that 80,000 hectares of wheat can be planted, yielding 120,000 shi of wheat.

	The Harbin Electric Power Bureau began supplying electricity to the entire city on the first of this month, with a sevenfold increase in power generation compared to last year.

	After the Japanese invaders surrendered, a power plant in Mudanjiang was repeatedly sabotaged by the Japanese invaders and Chiang bandits. Through the concerted efforts of all employees, it was repaired in October this year, and five new small power stations were established. Currently, the amount of electricity supplied has greatly increased, with power electricity accounting for more than 77%, which is extremely beneficial to the development of public and private industries in the city. The power plant's power supply area has reached 26 locations, extending the lines by more than 3,000 li.

	Since a coal mine in Mudanjiang was taken over and operated by the democratic government last year, 200 workers have been elected as mine managers, team leaders, and cadres. After a year of emancipation struggles and a large-scale production campaign, the mine has taken on a new look. Production has also increased greatly. In February of this year, nine coal pits were restored, and production increased from 9 tons per day to the current 1,380 tons per day. The highest record per person reached 4 tons, more than double the output during the enemy and puppet period. The current average daily transportation volume is 900 tons, an increase of 230% compared to before. The factory has also established an electrical factory, a sand-casting factory, a band saw factory, a woodworking factory, etc., and most of the machines and various parts can be self-supplied.
