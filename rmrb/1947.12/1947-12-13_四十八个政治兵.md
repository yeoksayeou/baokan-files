    Forty-Eight Political Soldiers
    On the 23rd, the weather was very cold, and it was snowing. I went to visit the new soldiers of the first platoon of the first company. When I entered the courtyard where they lived, the second and third squads of the first platoon, as well as the fourth squad of the second platoon, all ran out and surrounded me. They were a total of forty-eight people, all comrades from Wu Village in the Fifth District who had newly joined the army this time. "Look at these forty-odd people from our Wu Village, aren't they all young and useful?" "Comrade, look at these people from our Wu Village, aren't they all tall and strong?" They vied to say, one after another, with smiling faces, showing a very proud appearance. Listening to their laughter and looking at their cheerful and joyful faces, I suddenly thought of what Shi Lianhua said at the conscription meeting in the village: "We are all consciously and voluntarily joining the army, so there is no problem guaranteeing our service on the front line." To further confirm this issue, I asked them again, "Are you not afraid of hardship when fighting Old Chiang? Are you used to putting down your hoes and taking up guns? Do you not miss your families?" All forty-eight of them disagreed and said in unison: "Comrade, what are you talking about! We are all consciously and voluntarily political soldiers. We can't be afraid of this and that. Since we are willing to join the army, we don't miss our families. We won't go home until Chiang Kai-shek, that wimp, is overthrown." "Are all forty-eight of you volunteers?" "Why not? Everyone recognizes that if Old Chiang, that wimp, is not overthrown, we will not be able to completely liberate ourselves." Shi Jingtian rushed to express everyone's opinion. "At home, we dug up the roots of Little Chiang; this time, we are determined to join the army and dig up the old roots." Shi Yanming, a liberated farmer, excitedly spoke of his aspirations: "This time I join the army, I will resolutely fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." A twenty-one-year-old youth named Shi Yun said with gritted teeth: "After joining the army, I will capture Old Chiang alive!" "Capture Old Chiang, flay him, skin him, and light a lamp with his oil to avenge our hatred!" Class hatred has turned into an infinite power in everyone's hearts.

    四十八个政治兵
    二十三日，天很冷，下着雪，我去走访一连一排的新战士。当我走进他们住的院子时，一排二班、三班以及二排四班，都跑出来围住了我。他们一共是四十八个人，都是五区吴村这次新参军的同志。“你看俺吴村来的这四十多个人，那个不是又年青又管用？”“同志，你看俺吴村这一个个的，个子那个不是又大又壮？”他们你一言我一语地争着说。一个个笑嘻嘻地，显出十分骄傲的样子。我听着他们说笑，看着他们一个个愉快而喜悦的脸色，忽然想到在村里参军的会上，史莲花所说的：“我们都是自觉自愿参军的，拿到前线保险不成问题。”为了进一步证实这个问题，我又追问他们“打老蒋你们不怕吃苦？放下锄头拿枪杆，你们过惯了吗？不想家吗？”他们四十八个人，都很不以为然，同声的说：“同志，你看你说的这是啥话！我们都是自觉自愿的政治兵。不能怕这又怕那，既然愿意参军就不想家，啥时候把蒋介石那个孬种打倒了，才回家呢。”“你们四十八个都是自愿的吗？”“为啥不是，那个人不认识到老蒋这孬种不打倒，翻身就翻不彻底。”史景田抢着说出了大家的意见。“在家刨了小蒋根，这回坚决参军刨老根。”一个翻身农民史言明，兴奋的说着自己的志愿：“这回参军，我要坚决打到南京去，活捉蒋介石。”一个名叫史运的二十一岁的青年，咬牙切齿的说：“参了军，活捉老蒋！”“捉住老蒋，要剥皮抽筋，还要点天灯报仇恨！”阶级的仇恨，在大家心里变成了一种无穷的力量。
