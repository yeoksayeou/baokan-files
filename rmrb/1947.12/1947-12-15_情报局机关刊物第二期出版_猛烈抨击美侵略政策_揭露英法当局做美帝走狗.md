Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Belgrade Dispatch: The second issue of the "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist Parties of nine European countries, was published here on the 1st in Russian, English, and French. The editorial, titled "War Mongers Still Run Rampant," vigorously criticized the foreign policy of US imperialism, denounced the United States for supplying weapons to Chiang Kai-shek to carry out the civil war, and exposed the aggressive intentions of the United States in establishing strategic strongholds in the Far East, Greenland, Alaska, and Greece. It also pointed out that the severance of relations with the Soviet Union by Brazil and Chile, under the instigation of the United States, was a "spiritual preparation for war." When reviewing the US policy toward Germany, the publication very appropriately called the French authorities "unreserved American lackeys who completely obey the United States." As for the notorious Bevin, his following of the American master proves that he is "an unprincipled and brazen American imperialist dog." The publication announced in the conclusion of an essay that the Communist Party will continue to "support the struggle of all democratic and patriotic forces against the evil conspiracies of war mongers." The publication also contains the following important reports and articles, including Malenkov's "Activities of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party"; Duclos's "The French Communist Party in the Struggle for National Independence and Against American Expansionism"; Slánský's "Activities of the Czechoslovak Communist Party After Liberation"; Djilas's "Problems of Organizational Work of the Yugoslav Communist Party"; Zaslavsky's "American Imperialism's Agent Bevin"; Malik's "Insatiable American Colonialists" (on the establishment of the US-Greece Joint Staff). The publication also includes a chronicle of major events of the Communist Party.
