　　[This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 8th dispatch] In the area south of the Yellow River, after the fourth large-scale "saw" battle, news work has achieved unprecedented development. For more than a year, the Henan area has been in frequent warfare. News workers in various regions, with perseverance, have overcome all difficulties and adhered to the news front. Most newspapers continue to be published as usual, becoming banners guiding the local people's struggle against the Chiang bandits. Since the end of the fourth large-scale "saw" battle in early October, the central areas of Henan have been successively recovered, and the overall situation has suddenly improved. Under the advocacy of the Party Committee, the newly launched newspapers include "Longhai Daily" (Minquan), "Cao County Masses" (Cao County), "Economic News" (Second Special District), "Work Express" (Third Prefectural Committee), and "Work Newsletter" (Kunshan), a total of five types; and "Cao County Pictorial," "Nanhua Pictorial," and "Turnover Pictorial" (Kaocheng), three types of pictorials. During the large-scale "saw" battle, the "Kunshan Daily," "Nanwang Daily," "Linze Bulletin," "Yunju Bulletin," "Juancheng Bulletin," "Xin Juye," "Advancement Daily" (Second Military Subdistrict), "Grand Canal Warrior" (Seventh Military Subdistrict), eight types in total, which were once suspended, and "Lu Southwest News," "Grand Canal News" (Seven Branches), three types of news work publications, and "Dongping Turn Over Daily" (renamed "Victory Daily"), which is still in the guerrilla environment, continue to be published. The "Jining-Jiaxiang" and "Wenshang" newspapers, unable to purchase printing equipment in the guerrilla environment, are published in handwritten form. Fengxian also published the "Fengxian Weekly" under the same circumstances. "Yuncheng Minbao," "Linze Bulletin," "Juancheng Bulletin," "Xin Juye," "Xin Yunbei," and "Yunju Bulletin," etc., expanded their content irregularly, from one page to two pages. The Third Prefectural Committee's "Dazhong Daily" was renamed "Huxi Dazhong." As of today, every county in the Second Military Subdistrict has a newspaper. Except for Dongming and Dongyuan counties in the Fifth Military Subdistrict, all other counties have published newspapers or pictorials. Most counties in the Seventh Military Subdistrict have newspapers published, with a total of 37 existing newspapers, pictorials, and news work publications, including five types of mimeographed newspapers, three types of handwritten newspapers, and four types of pictorials and news work publications. There are also quite a few "mobile wall newspapers" and "blackboard newspapers" run by counties and districts in the Third and Fifth Military Subdistricts. It is particularly worth mentioning that several pictorials in the Fifth Military Subdistrict, with a national style, adopt local outstanding events, and are mimeographed and colored, with both pictures and text, which are extremely popular among the local masses. All of the existing four branch offices and 21 county news stations have resumed work (most of them have been坚持working), and two county stations have been established in Chengwu and Yucheng. Many district and village news groups have also begun to be established, and key correspondents have been cultivated. Yunbei has established a key correspondent group, and Heze, Kaocheng, Qibin, Dingtao, Yunbei, and Yunju have all launched news competitions. After Shanxian completed the 100 articles per month campaign, Kunshan launched the 1,000 articles campaign at the county-wide model worker conference. In eight days, more than 1,200 articles were completed. Recently, Nanwang launched a two articles per cadre campaign, and the tenth district of Yunbei established a letter reporting system to further integrate news work with mass work. The conference one article campaign (everyone attending the meeting writes an article) has also been launched in some county and district meetings. In Yuncheng, after advocating collective writing, the quality has been greatly improved. The business work of branch offices and county stations has gradually been strengthened due to the gradual allocation of personnel. Individual county stations have achieved preliminary comprehensive manuscript work. According to statistics on external submissions, the four districts of Henan submitted 431 manuscripts to the branch office in October, almost doubling the 227 manuscripts submitted in September. Now the news and communication work in the four districts of Henan is developing more universally and deeply.

　　冀鲁豫黄河南岸“拉锯”战中
    新闻工作大发展
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】黄河以南地区，在第四次大拉锯战争后，新闻工作获得空前发展。一年多来，河南地区始终在频繁的战争中，我各地新闻工作者，以坚忍不拔的精神，克服一切困难，坚持新闻阵地，大部分报纸仍照常出版，成为指导当地人民对蒋匪斗争的旗帜。自十月初旬，第四次大拉锯战争结束后，河南中心地区相继收复，整个局势突趋好转，在党委倡导下，新创刊的报纸计有“陇海报”（民权）、“曹县群众”（曹县）、“经济报”（二专署）、“工作快报”（三地委）、“工作通讯报”（昆山）等五种。“曹县画报”、“南华画报”、“翻身画报”（考城）等画报三种。在大拉锯战争中，一度停刊的“昆山报”、“南旺报”、“临泽通报”、“郓钜通报”、“鄄城通报”、“新钜野”、“挺进报”（二军分区）、“运河战士”（七军分区）等八种，“鲁西南通讯”、“运河通讯”（七支社）等通讯工作刊三种，仍处于游击环境中的“东平翻身报”（改名“胜利报”），始终坚持出版。“济（宁）嘉（祥）”、“汶上”两报，在游击环境中无法购置印刷工具，用毛笔抄写出版。丰县也在同样情况下，出了“丰县周报”。“郓城民报”、“临泽通报”、“鄄城通报”、“新钜野”、“新郓北”、“郓钜通报”等，并不定期的扩大篇幅，由一版增至两版。三地委的“大众报”改名“湖西大众”。截至今日为止，二分区县县有报。五分区除东明、东垣二县外，其余县份均出版报纸或画报。七分区大部县份，均有报纸出版，共计现有报纸、画报及通讯工作刊物三十七种，内油印报五种，笔写报三种，画报及通讯工作刊物四种。其他三、五分区各县区所办之“流动壁报”、“黑板报”为数也不少。特别值得提出的是，五分区的几种画报，以民族的风格，采取当地的突出事件，油印后涂上彩色，有画有文，极为当地群众所喜爱。现有之四个支社、二十一个县通讯站，全部恢复工作（其中大部一直坚持工作）外，并又建立城武、虞城两个县站，许多区村通讯组亦开始建立，并树立骨干通讯员。郓北建立了骨干通讯组，菏泽、考城、齐滨、定陶、郓北、郓钜均发起通讯竞赛。单县完成一月一百篇稿运动后，昆山在全县功模大会上，展开千篇稿运动。八天时间，完成一千二百余篇。最近，南旺又发起干部两篇稿运动，郓北十区则建立写信汇报制度，使通讯工作进一步与群众工作结合。大会一篇稿运动（到会的人写一篇稿），也在一些县区会上展开，郓城在提倡集体写稿后，质量大为提高，支社、县站业务工作，由于人员逐渐配备，亦已逐渐加强。个别县站已作到初步综合稿件。向外发稿统计，河南四个分区，十月份转来分社之稿四百三十一件，比九月份转来稿二百二十七件几乎增加一倍，现在河南四个分区的新闻通讯工作，更向普遍深入方面发展。
