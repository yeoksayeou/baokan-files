    Shexian No. 6 High School Organizes Students
    To Help Liberated Youth Learn Culture
    [Reported from Shexian by this newspaper] Shexian No. 6 High School is located in Donglutou Village. After the masses obtained land and houses, they urgently demanded a cultural liberation. Based on the demands of the peasants, Shexian No. 6 High School called on students to use their spare time and self-study time to organize and unite the liberated youth in the village, establish study groups, teach the liberated youth to recognize characters, write characters, and learn abacus, acting as teachers for the liberated youth in culture. High school students also learn from the liberated youth in politics, acting as students of the liberated youth. Currently, fifteen liberated youth have established two study groups. The liberated youth are extremely enthusiastic about learning. For example, in Cheng Xishun's group, in addition to benches, they also moved the lacquered table they received when struggling against the landlord last winter into the study group. After returning from working in the fields during the day, they go to the study group to learn. After dinner in the evening, they go to write characters and learn the abacus.

    [Reported from Pingshun by this newspaper] On the 8th of this month, the Third District convened a district-wide meeting of primary school teachers, volunteer teachers, and education directors to discuss how to launch the winter study movement. The meeting unanimously agreed that the task of this winter's winter study is to fully mobilize the masses to carry out winter production to compensate for the poor harvest and improve culture simultaneously. The meeting also reviewed the problems of past winter studies. In the past, most of the education directors were targets of struggle. Cadres spoke more and the masses discussed less in winter studies, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Some cadres did not go themselves but only asked the masses to go, and the masses said, "The cadres are not going, why should we go?" This situation accounted for more than half of the villages in the entire district. These are the reasons why winter studies have not been successful. The meeting decided that this winter's winter studies must change the above practices.

    涉县六高组织学生
    帮助翻身青年学文化
    【本报涉县讯】涉县六高所在村东鹿头，群众获得了土地房子以后，迫切要求文化翻身。六高根据农民要求，号召学生在课暇和自习时间去组织团结村上的翻身青年，成立学习小组，教翻身青年认字写字学珠算，在文化上当翻身青年先生；高小学生在政治上又向翻身青年学习，当翻身青年的学生。现在已有十五个翻身青年，成立起两个学习小组，翻身青年学习非常热情，象程喜顺组内，除有凳子外，还把去冬斗争地主时分的漆桌子，也搬在学习组内。白天从地里做活回来，就到学习组内去学习，到晚上一吃了晚饭，就去写字、学算盘。

    【本报平顺讯】三区在本月八号，召开全区小教、义教、教育主任会议，讨论如何开展冬学运动，一致认为今冬的冬学任务，全力发动群众开展冬季生产弥补歉收与提高文化一齐并进。又检讨了以往冬学的毛病，过去的教育主任，大部是斗争对象，上冬学干部说的多，群众讨论少，这个说罢那个说，引起群众不满；有些是干部不去光叫群众去，群众说：“干部还不去哩，咱去顶甚哩，”以全区说来，这种情况占半数村以上。这都是冬学搞不好的原因。会议决定今冬的冬学一定要改变以上作法。  （生佩、起定、俊科）
