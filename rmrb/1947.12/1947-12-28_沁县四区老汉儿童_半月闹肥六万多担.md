[Taoyue News, 26th] To prepare for spring plowing next year, old men and children in the Fourth District of Qin County have launched a fertilizer collection campaign. In half a month, they have collected a total of 60,500 loads of fertilizer. Calculated at 30 loads per mu, this can fertilize 2,016 mu of land. At a district-wide meeting on November 17, everyone, young and old, was mobilized to step up winter production, and the villages immediately took action, with old men and children specializing in fertilizer collection. For example, the Zhang Lanlou mutual aid team in Zhongchen automatically cut 9,600 jin of cogongrass for military families in one day. Children and women in Nanzhang, Yaoshang, and Dongduanzhuang villages cut more than 5,000 jin of cogongrass. It is estimated that the entire district cut 328,712 jin of cogongrass, which can be used to compost 54,800 loads of fertilizer. At 30 loads per mu, this can fertilize 1,800 mu of land. The entire district collected 5,700 loads of manure, which can fertilize 190 mu. Combining digging hemp ponds and composting slag, the entire district has now collected a total of 60,500 loads of fertilizer, which can fertilize 2,016 mu. Under the slogan of "Sweep the courtyard diligently, add more bedding to the pens, cut cogongrass, compost more, dig hemp ponds, and collect wastewater," the villages continue to carry out the fertilizer collection campaign.

[Xiangyuan News] On the 13th of this month, Xishan Village in the Second District summarized the achievements of twenty days of production. Wang Fucun, a liberated farmer, earned 143,000 yuan in silver dollars by transporting goods to Xingtai once, enough to buy ten shi of millet. Zhao, an old woman, said, "After I clearly understood the deficit from accounting, I started working hard from dawn till dusk every day. I spun six jin of cotton and wove two jin of cloth in twenty days." Twenty carts from the village went to Xingtai, earning 1.43 million yuan in silver dollars. Those who could not go to Xingtai earned 860,000 yuan in silver dollars by selling coal, charcoal, and going to market. Cotton ginning, cotton rolling, carrying poles, working in kilns, and weaving baskets earned a total of 497,500 yuan in silver dollars. In total, 2,787,500 yuan in silver dollars were earned from sideline production in twenty days. Two hundred and thirty-seven spinning women spun a total of 932 jin of cotton and wove 110 jin of cloth. Old men and children in the village collected a total of 23,000 loads of fertilizer. After summarizing and checking, everyone unanimously proposed: "As long as we can earn money this winter, life will not be difficult next year."

[News] In order to lay the foundation for large-scale production next year, the Peking University School of Economics and Finance called on the entire school to launch a winter fertilizer collection campaign on November 25. In response to the school's call, all students (136 people) picked up manure in their spare time, on moonlit nights, and at dawn. Initially, they used the villagers' baskets, but later they felt it was inconvenient. Fifteen groups from three classes successively wove thirty-three baskets. So far, they have picked up a total of 6,097 jin of manure, accumulating forty-one carts, about 20,000 jin. In the process of picking up manure, many students showed a high degree of enthusiasm. Jia Hengxuan was afraid that he would not be able to pick up enough manure during the day, so he got up at four o'clock in the morning and ran to Huangnian Village, ten li away, to pick up manure. When he returned, his hands were so frozen that he could not hold anything. Liang Wenyao was afraid that he would not be able to pick up manure after eating, so he went to pick up manure after class without eating lunch. In three weeks, he picked up 285 jin by himself.
