Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 26th, another running dog of the Chiang faction, the Social Democratic Party, lodged a "protest" because the Kuomintang "monopolized ten electoral districts," preventing the Social Democratic Party from nominating candidates. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party are now eagerly begging for places as bogus legislators and bogus supervisors, so the bogus elections for legislators and supervisors have been postponed again. Chiang Kai-shek's State Council passed a resolution on the 27th to postpone the bogus elections for legislators and supervisors until the end of January and before January 10th next year. News continues to report on the scandalous state of affairs during the three days of the bogus election. In Sichuan, the Youth Party clashed with the Kuomintang during the "general election," and many Youth Party members in Pengxi, Huxian and other places were killed, and more than 200 were arrested. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 27th, a bloody conflict occurred at a polling station in Changsha, leaving ten people dead and many injured. According to United Press dispatches from Peiping and Shanghai, when the ballots were counted in the bogus election in Peiping, many ballots were found to contain the words "terrible," "world of ghosts," and the rapidly rising prices of corn, flour, and millet. Another person put 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek notes into the ballot box instead of a ballot, indicating that the value of Chiang Kai-shek's currency was not even worth a piece of paper. Some ballots in Shanghai contained the words "big monkey." This shows how much the people in the Chiang-controlled areas hate and despise the so-called general election of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

　　人民憎恶蒋匪伪选
    票上多写“可怕”“鬼世界”字样
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据塔斯社二十六日沪讯，蒋党另一家奴民社党，因为国民党“包办十个选举区”，使民社党不能提出候选人，而提出“抗议。”民青两党现正津津有味地乞求伪立委伪监委的名额，因此伪立、监委“选举”又告延期，蒋匪国务会议已于二十七日通过立、监委伪选延至明年一月底及一月十日以前完毕。各方消息继续报导三天伪选中的丑态，四川青年党在“大选”中与国民党发生冲突，蓬溪、沪县等地青年党员多人被杀，被捕者亦达二百多人。又据路透社南京二十七日消息：长沙某投票站发生流血冲突，十人被击毙，多人受伤。据合众社北平及上海消息，北平伪选开票时发现选票多张写着“可怕”、“鬼世界”，以及正在暴涨的玉米、面粉、和小米的价格，另有一个人以二千元的蒋币代替选票投入票箱，表示蒋币价值已不如一张纸，上海有的选票写着“大马猴”三字。足见蒋区人民是如何憎恨与轻蔑蒋匪的所谓大选。
