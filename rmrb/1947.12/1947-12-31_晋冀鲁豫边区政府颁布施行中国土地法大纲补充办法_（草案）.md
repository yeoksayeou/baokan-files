　　The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government Promulgates and Implements Supplementary Measures (Draft) to the Land Law Outline of China
    [Our News] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government announced on the 28th that it accepts the Land Law Outline of China as the border region's land law. At the same time, it formulated and implemented supplementary measures (draft) to the Land Law Outline of China. The full text is published as follows:

    1. Article 3 of the Outline states: "Abolish all land ownership of ancestral halls, temples, monasteries, schools, organs, and organizations," including the land of churches.

    2. Article 4 of the Outline states: "Abolish all debts in rural areas before the land system reform," not including commercial buying and selling debt relationships.

    3. Article 6 of the Outline states: "According to the entire rural population" refers to the current population during the period of equal land distribution in that village. Except as stipulated in Article 10 (A) of the Outline: "Poor peasants with only one or two family members may be allotted land equal to two or three family members at the discretion of the village peasant congress," all are equally distributed according to the current population at that time.

    4. Supplement to Article 6 of the Outline:
    (A) Wasteland reclaimed since 1945 should belong to the reclaimers and is not included in the equal distribution.
    (B) The land of wealthy middle peasants may be appropriately extracted under the principle of "extracting from the more and supplementing the less, extracting from the fertile and supplementing the barren," but their movable property and houses shall not be touched.
    (C) Famine refugees and immigrants can only be determined to receive a share in one place and shall not receive double shares in two places.
    (D) For famine refugees who have no news from outside, land shall be distributed according to law, but movable property shall not be distributed. The share of land shall be kept by the village peasant association and temporarily given to tenant farmers, poor peasants, and other poor people for cultivation. No rent shall be charged, only burdens shall be paid. However, the land shall be reserved for a period of three years (starting from the date of land distribution). If they do not return after the expiration date, the share of land shall be redistributed. During the time limit, those who return to receive land must be certified by the local peasant representative assembly if their current residence is in the liberated area.
    (E) The land of mosques shall be handled by the Hui people themselves under the principle of equal distribution of all land in the respective villages.

    5. Supplement to Article 7 of the Outline: In areas with little land and a large population, if tenant farmers and poor peasants are still unable to maintain their livelihoods after equal distribution, the issue may be resolved through immigration on a voluntary basis.

    6. Supplement to Article 8 of the Outline:
    (A) Landlords who also rent out houses in towns may have their rented houses confiscated and distributed together. Generally, the principle is to distribute them to the poor people of the town. The distribution method shall be determined by the town's people's representative assembly (or its committee). If disputes arise with the countryside, they may be resolved jointly with the county peasant representative assembly (or its committee). If the houses are used by tenants to operate industry and commerce, the relationship between them and the tenants after confiscation and distribution should be handled in accordance with the customary methods of renting houses. In principle, it should not affect the operation of industry and commerce.
    (B) Since the anti-traitor liquidation, fruits excessively occupied by cadres must be returned.

    7. Supplement to Article 9 (A) of the Outline: Mountains, mulberry forests, bamboo forests, water conservancy facilities, reed fields, orchards, ponds, lakes, and lotus ponds, etc., shall be discussed by the peasants in various places. Those that can be divided shall be divided equally; if equal division is not conducive to operation, the method of joint-stock operation may be adopted.

    8. Supplement to Article 9 (B) of the Outline:
    (A) Mines that have been or are being prepared for mining by the government shall not be divided; mines that have been discovered but are not temporarily mined by the government may be distributed to peasants for operation. When mining is needed, they shall be taken back, and the local government shall allocate land to the peasants and appropriately compensate for their production losses.
    (B) The affiliated public land along the existing railways, the land prepared for immediate railway construction, existing farms, public buildings, parks, mausoleums, and designated highways and rivers, etc., shall not be distributed. The use of this land shall be jointly determined by the relevant people's representative assemblies (or their committees) and the government at all levels. No person shall retain land without authorization under any pretext.
    (C) River滩 land, sandy land, and charitable land, etc., shall be handled by the county district peasant representative assembly (or its committee).

    9. Supplement to Article 10 (B) of the Outline: Unemployed workers living in rural areas who cannot maintain their livelihoods may return to their place of origin to receive land with proof from the government of their current residence.

    10. Article 10 (C) of the Outline states that the "People's Liberation Army" includes liberated fighters.

    11. Supplement to Article 10 (C) of the Outline:
    (A) The individuals (including People's Liberation Army soldiers, militiamen, civilian workers, and other personnel) who sacrificed in the front line battles since the War of Resistance Against Japan should still be given the same share of land and property as the peasants.
    (B) Land prepared for the settlement of honorary veterans and demobilized soldiers shall be retained by the administrative office for overall planning and shall not be distributed. However, the quantity shall not exceed one-thousandth of the total land in the administrative office area. This reserved land shall be temporarily handed over to poor peasants and other poor people for cultivation by the affiliated county peasant representative assembly (or its committee). No rent shall be charged, only burdens shall be paid.

    12. Supplement to Article 11 of the Outline: The format of the land ownership certificate shall be uniformly stipulated by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, printed by each administrative office according to the format, and handed over to the county governments for responsible filling and issuance.

    13. Supplement to Article 13 of the Outline: The organizational regulations of the people's courts at all levels shall be formulated by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region People's Congress.

    14. Supplement to Article 16 of the Outline:
    (A) The "areas where land has already been equally distributed" referred to in this article refers to areas where the distribution situation is in line with the principles and spirit of the Land Law Outline of China. If there are still cases of illegal occupation, uneven distribution of fertile and barren land, resulting in poor peasants being unable to maintain their livelihoods, they must still be reported for redistribution or adjusted.
    (B) In areas where land has already been equally distributed before the promulgation of the Land Law Outline of China, if landlords and rich peasants still cannot maintain their livelihoods despite labor, they may be supplemented with land according to law.

    15. These measures may be revised at any time when necessary.

    16. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.
