Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. According to various reports, the markets in Shanghai, Guangdong, and other areas controlled by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have once again fallen into extreme chaos. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 28th: The latest devaluation of the Chiang Kai-shek currency, which began on the 15th of this month, reached a shocking new peak on the 28th. On that day, the black market exchange rate for US dollars opened at 141,000 to 1, and immediately soared to 155,000 to 1 by noon. Shanghai financiers compared the financial market to "swinging like a pendulum" and believed that the Chiang Kai-shek government has absolutely no ability to stabilize the Chiang Kai-shek currency. The general public's distrust of the Chiang Kai-shek currency has reached its extreme; all floating capital, in addition to investing in limited commodities, and the huge amount of money flowing into Shanghai from the war zones, is being poured into the US dollar market. Local black market merchants say that as soon as they get Chiang Kai-shek currency, they immediately exchange it for US dollars. The Associated Press stated that because the official exchange rate of 70,000 to 1 is far less than half of the market price, exports have almost completely stopped. At the same time, according to a Central News Agency report, prices in Shanghai have been soaring daily. Due to the large amount of capital fleeing south to Hong Kong as a result of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' military failures, Guangzhou's finances have also fluctuated violently, and prices have risen sharply, frightening the Chiang Kai-shek authorities.

　　蒋匪无力稳定金融出口几乎完全停顿
    【新华社陕北卅日电】据各方报导，蒋匪沪、粤等地市场，又陷入极度混乱。据美联社上海廿八日电：开始于本月十五日蒋币又一次贬值，发展至二十八日已达到惊人之新高峰。是日美钞黑市汇价开盘为十四万一千比一，中午即骤升为十五万五千比一。沪金融家将金融市场比做像“钟摆一样摇摆。”并认为蒋匪政府绝无能力使蒋币稳定。一般人民对蒋币之不信任程度已达于极点，所有游资除向有限之商品投资外，由战区流入上海之巨量金钱，均投入美钞市场；当地之黑市商人称：他们一得到蒋币，也立刻将它兑换成美元。美联社称：由于七万比一之官定牌价远低于市价一半以下，出口也几乎完全停顿。同时据中央社报导，上海物价日来亦剧涨不已。由于蒋匪军事失败所促成的大量资金南逃香港，广州金融亦激烈波动，物价急升，蒋匪当局被吓得惊慌不已。
