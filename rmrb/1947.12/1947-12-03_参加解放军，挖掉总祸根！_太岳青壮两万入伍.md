　　Join the People's Liberation Army, Uproot the Source of All Evil!
　　20,000 Young and Strong Men from Taiyue Enlist
　　[Our Taiyue Dispatch, 1st] As the victorious news of the great counter-offensive spread, cries arose: "Fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!", "Join the People's Liberation Army, uproot the source of all evil!", "If you want good fortune for generations to come, you must uproot the old Chiang root." Subsequently, young and strong emancipated peasants flocked into the People's Liberation Army in entire rows and companies. From mid-September to mid-November, over 21,000 emancipated peasants from sixteen counties including Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, Zhao City, Tunliu, Anze, Changzi in northern Yue, Gaoping, Qinshui, Jincheng, Fushan, Linfen, Hongdong, Xiangling in southern Yue, and Jiyuan in northern Henan, enlisted (Yangcheng before September is not yet included in the statistics). During discussions in various places, people tearfully recounted their suffering and hatred toward the big and small Chiang Kai-sheks. Lü Cangzhu from Fushan's Fan Village shouted: "It's not enough to defeat the little Chiang Kai-shek, we must also uproot the old Chiang root." Li Guisheng from Qinshui's Yangjia River said to his brother: "Brother, we had no land in the past and were exploited and oppressed. Now that we have been emancipated, I want to join the People's Liberation Army to uproot the old Chiang root." Zhao Xingwang, an old man from Shangjia Village in Tunliu, had already sent two of his children into the People's Liberation Army, the first of whom had sacrificed his life. This time, he sent his third son into the People's Liberation Army. The first item on the merit-making plan drawn up at the time of enlistment was: fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and not return home without killing the Chiang bandit. The enthusiasm was unprecedented. Xiao Zhenxiang's grandmother from Niudian Village in Gaoping personally registered her grandson while leaning on a crutch. Song Huaiyu's mother from Songjia Village said: "Having an Eighth Route Army member in the family is better than a million pounds of gold." This time, poor and hired peasants took the lead in signing up, setting off a wave of enlistment. When Wang Gushou, a poor peasant from Jincheng, received the news of the great counter-offensive, he instructed his son, Xiao Wan, to join the army from his sickbed, saying: "As long as Chiang Kai-shek can be captured alive, I will die happily." Gu and poor people from Yuneng Village said: "We took the lead in uprooting the small roots last year, and we will take the lead in digging up the old roots this year." Following the lead of the hired peasant Lin Baisheng, fifty-two people signed up. Everywhere, landlords, despots, and local ruffians were resolutely forbidden from joining our ranks. Zhang Shengde, a landlord from Anshuhuan in Fushan, attempted to have his son Zhang Deyi infiltrate the People's Liberation Army, but was discovered and forbidden by everyone, "They will never serve us, letting them in is like handing them the gun." Zhang Shengde, unwilling to give up, replaced Zhang Deyi with Zhang Dexi and Zhang Dezhi to sign up in Qiulin Village, but was similarly forbidden by the masses. When Li Shun'er from Dianshang Village in Gaoping enlisted in the army, he asked the masses to approve his marriage to the daughter of He Zhixiang, who had served as a traitorous district chief, but the masses said: "No, even if you don't join the army, you will not be allowed to marry a traitor's daughter." Therefore, the quality of this enlistment is particularly good.

　　参加解放军，挖掉总祸根！
    太岳青壮两万入伍
    【本报太岳一日电】大反攻的胜利消息传到那里，那里就响起一片呼声：“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”，“参加解放军，挖掉总祸根”，“要想子子孙孙好，还要挖掉蒋老根。”随后年轻力壮的翻身农民就整排整连的涌入解放军。从九月中旬到十一月中旬止，已有岳北平遥、介休、灵石、霍县、赵城、屯留、安泽、长子及岳南之高平、沁水、晋城、浮山、临汾、洪洞、襄陵，豫北之济源等十六县，二万一千余翻身农民入伍（九月以前之阳城尚未统计在内）。各地在进行讨论时，连哭带诉的诉说自己受大小老蒋的痛苦与仇恨。浮山范村吕苍珠叫着：“把小蒋介石打垮了，还不行，还要把蒋介石这老根子拔掉。”沁水杨家河李桂生对自己哥说：“大哥，咱过去没地，受人剥削压迫。现在翻了身，我要参加解放军，挖掉蒋老根。”屯留上贾村老汉赵兴旺，已将两个孩子送进解放军，第一个已牺牲，此次又把三儿送入了解放军。所有入伍时订的立功计划，头一条就是：打到南京去，活捉蒋介石，不杀蒋贼不回家。其热烈情况，为前所未有。高平牛店村萧祯祥祖母拄着拐棍亲自给孙子报名。宋家庄宋怀鱼母亲说：“家内出了八路军，胜于黄金百万斤。”此次由贫雇带头报名，掀起了参军浪潮。晋城贫农王古首得到大反攻消息时，就在病床上嘱咐儿子小完参军，他说：“只要能活捉蒋介石，我死了也痛快。”庾能村雇贫说：“去年拔小根是我们带头，今年刨老根我们还要带头。”接着在雇贫林柏生带头之下，有五十二人报名。各地普遍坚决禁止了地主恶霸及地痞流氓混入咱们的队伍。浮山杏树垣地主张盛德企图叫他儿子张德义混入解放军，被大家发觉禁止了，“他们决不会为我们服务的，让他们混进来了，就等于把枪杆子交给他们。”张盛德不死心，又换了张德喜、张德知到秋林庄去报名，同样被群众禁止了。高平店上村李顺儿参军时，要求群众批准他和当过汉奸区长的何致祥的闺女结婚，群众说：“不能，就是你不去参军，也不能批准你和汉奸女人结婚。”所以此次参军的质量特别好。
