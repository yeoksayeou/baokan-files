Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Under the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime's control of foreign exchange, restrictions on paper imports, and the pressure of soaring prices in the Chiang-controlled areas, thirteen privately-owned and non-Chiang Kai-shek direct lineage newspapers in Changsha, Hankou, and Fuzhou have been forced to cease publication in the past two months. The newspapers that ceased publication in Changsha are New Tide, Dagong, Da Wanbao, Li Bao, and Hunan Evening News. In Hankou, they are Datong, Workers, Liming, and Wuhan Times. In Fuzhou, they are Linsen, Southern, and Minhai. According to incomplete statistics, from March of this year to date, more than fifty-eight newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas have ceased publication due to political and economic oppression by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.
