    Nanliucun Village, Qiuxian County
    Detailed Household Planning
    [Report from our Jinnan Office, 17th] Nanliucun Village, District One, Qiuxian County, has established household plans for each group. For example, the Dong Jinxiang group has six households, totaling 23 people (including eight female semi-laborers, six girls, seven male full laborers, and two boys). After paying public grain, they have a surplus of 3,250 jin of grain, averaging 140 jin per person. They currently have 260 jin of cotton, averaging 11 jin per person. The plan for the future regarding grain consumption is seasonal. For the first three months (November, December, and January), there is no agricultural work, and because the work is light, grain consumption should be reduced to 12 liang per person per day. For the latter three months (February, March, and April), agricultural work begins, and because the work gradually becomes heavier, grain consumption should be increased to 1.5 jin per person per day. The group's total grain consumption for six months is 5,224.5 jin. Compared to the current surplus of 3,250 jin, the group faces a grain shortage of 1,947.5 jin. For clothing, each person needs two zhang of cloth, totaling 46 zhang for the group. Each zhang of cloth requires four jin of seed cotton, totaling 184 jin of cotton. After providing for clothing, there is a surplus of 76 jin of cotton. They have 14,400 yuan, which, including the purchase of miscellaneous items, totals 21,600 yuan, for a grand total of 38,000 yuan. In summary, daily expenses for oil, salt, etc., New Year's expenses, and funds to cover the grain shortage require a total of 365,850 yuan. After using the money from the remaining cotton, there is still a shortage of 344,330 yuan. This will mainly rely on sideline production to make up for it. A sideline production plan was immediately formulated, including milling flour, accumulating fertilizer, raising pigs, and gathering firewood, aiming to earn a total of 391,000 yuan. After covering the 344,330 yuan needed for the grain shortage and daily expenses, there will be a surplus of 46,670 yuan. After discussion, the entire group is very confident in completing this plan.

    邱县南刘村
    细订按家计划
    【本报冀南十七日电】邱县一区南刘村，各组都订出按家计划。如董金箱组共六户，廿三口人（包括女半劳力八人，女孩六人，男整劳力七人，男孩二人），除缴的公粮外，尚存粮三千二百五十斤，每人平均粮食一百四十斤，现存棉花二百六十斤，每人平均十一斤。今后计划，对粮的开支上，是有季节性的；前三个月（十一、十二月、正）不作农业，因活轻，应少吃粮食，每人每天十二两；后三个月（二、三、四月）开始作农业，因活渐重，应当多吃粮食，每人每日斤半。全组六个月共得用粮五千二百二十四斤半，与现存粮三千二百五十斤相较，全组共缺粮一千九百四十七斤半。全组单衣每人用布二丈，共得用布四十六丈，每丈布合四斤籽棉，共得用棉一百八十四斤，存棉除穿外，下剩棉七十六斤，洋一万四千四百元，连买零星东西，全组在算上二万一千六百元，合计洋三万八千元。总之，日常油盐等开支，过年费与缺粮变款，共需洋卅六万五千八百五十元，除拿剩下的棉花钱补上外，还缺三十四万四千三百三十元。这就主要依靠副业生产来弥补了。当即订出副业生产计划，磨粉、积肥、养猪、拾柴等共要赚洋三十九万一千元，把缺粮和日常开支所缺的三十四万四千三百三十元补足后，还剩四万六千六百七十元。全组讨论后，对完成这一计划，很有信心。
