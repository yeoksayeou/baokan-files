Many schools in southern Hebei are moving towards combining teaching with production. Yuanchao Benqi Elementary School, in summing up its annual production, found that the Cultural Cooperative, with an initial capital of 190,000 yuan, has now developed to a share capital of more than 1,420,000 yuan, supporting the development of cultural undertakings and becoming the largest supplier of cultural food for the people's schools and elementary schools in eastern Yuanchao. Great achievements have also been made in agriculture. The vegetables grown, after deducting fertilizer and seeds, yielded a total profit of more than 430,000 yuan. Now, winter sideline groups for bean sprouts, manure accumulation, and noodles have been set up. Students of the Qianhou Xiancheng Elementary School in the First District have solved their tuition fees with the fruits of their labor. In the First District of Qiu County, 19 of the 25 schools have engaged in production, cultivating a total of 159 mu of land, harvesting more than 6,400 jin of miscellaneous grains, and planting 66 mu of cotton, harvesting more than 1,000 jin. Thirty percent is allocated to the school's office expenses to save public expenditure; 20 percent is used by the school as bonuses to encourage students' enthusiasm for production; and 50 percent is distributed according to labor, with an average wage of 2.5 jin per work unit, solving the difficulty of learning expenses and enabling them to be self-sufficient in office expenses. A total of 969 jin of rice was saved in office expenses in three months. Xibaicun Elementary School in Ren County planted 4 mu of wheat and 2 mu of cotton during extracurricular rest time, and then planted 1 mu of cabbage on the wheat stubble. According to statistics, a total of 9 dou of wheat, 160 jin of cotton, and 1,200 heads of cabbage were harvested, selling for 60,000 yuan. 500 jin of firewood was gathered. The school has completely achieved self-sufficiency in solving the problems of firewood for burning in winter and the students' books and stationery. The students plan to accumulate another 10 carts of fertilizer this winter in preparation for continuing production next year. After the @Taitou Elementary School in the Fourth District of Qinghe transformed its training method and implemented the "Three Combinations" (education, production, and central work), it has made great achievements in production. From the ninth to the tenth lunar month, boys collected more than 13,000 jin of firewood, girls spun 74 jin of cotton, and knitted 29 caps and cushions.
