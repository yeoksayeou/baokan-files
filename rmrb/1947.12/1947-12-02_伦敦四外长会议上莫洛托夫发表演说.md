Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, London, 27th: On the 26th, Molotov delivered a speech on the German peace treaty issue at the Foreign Ministers Meeting, over which he presided. The full text is as follows:

　　We have decided to discuss the six issues listed on our agenda. Some of these concern the discussion of peace treaties with Germany and Austria. These issues are not of equal importance. The Soviet delegation suggests that the preparation of the German peace treaty issue should be given priority on our agenda.

　　Because the Soviet delegation found this proposal was opposed, we will explain our motives in more detail.

　　The Soviet government believes that the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany can no longer be delayed. It can be said that two and a half years have passed since Germany surrendered, but there has been no progress on this issue.

　　We have spent a lot of time preparing peace treaties with the former five German allies. Finally, this work was generally completed successfully. The peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland have been implemented. The prospect of peaceful development is unfolding before the people of these countries, which not only conforms to the wishes of these people, but also to the interests of establishing a solid peace in Europe.

　　Now, the time has come to decide on the German peace treaty. If the Foreign Ministers Meeting delays the decision on this issue and lists it as a secondary issue in the meeting, no one will understand us. At the same time, we must also resolve the Austrian issue. This is one of the tasks that this Foreign Ministers Meeting must resolve.

　　We have decided to discuss several issues related to Germany at this meeting. Some of these are important issues of a current, temporary nature, which should be given serious attention. But the basic issue for Germany is the peace treaty issue. Because the time of the Foreign Ministers Meeting is occupied by several other pressing issues, it has been difficult to start preparing for this treaty until now.

　　However, on the other hand, this issue can no longer be shelved.

　　We all recognize that the issue of a peace treaty with Germany is a matter of Germany's fate, and also a matter of the complete restoration of peace in Europe. It is not only Germany that needs this treaty, but also the people of all countries in Europe (and not only Europe). Can it be denied that the people of Europe long to finally establish a solid peace throughout Europe? And this is very easy to understand, because without establishing a final peace in Europe, there can be no solid universal peace.

　　Naturally, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany is not a simple issue, and there will be some differences of opinion between us in the process of discussing it, but delaying the resolution of this issue will never make the issue easier to resolve.

　　As everyone knows, in the post-war period, on some issues of international importance, there are often differences of opinion between the Soviet Union and the democratic countries friendly to it on the one hand, and the United States and some Western European countries on the other.

　　In this regard, the situation during the war is vastly different from the situation after the war.

　　What can explain the reasons for this current division? What is the basis of the division?

　　During World War II, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union and other democratic countries formed an anti-Hitler alliance to jointly carry out a war of liberation against the fascist countries' camp, which pursued world domination and the establishment of a worldwide fascist system. This struggle united them and allowed them to effectively decide many complex issues of international importance. It is enough for us to point out facts such as the Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam conferences of the three powers, and the famous decisions of the three powers' conferences have become important contributions to the history of various countries.

　　After the end of World War II, the situation changed. At this time, everyone understood that the countries that had previously participated in the anti-fascist alliance had different goals for establishing post-war peace.

　　Everyone understood that some countries were striving to establish a democratic peace based on the equality of all countries and the recognition of the equal sovereignty of large and small countries. This kind of peace provides opportunities for the development of peaceful cooperation between countries (regardless of their social systems and ideologies). Establishing a democratic peace also means that the defeated countries also have the right to free democratic development and complete restoration of sovereignty.

　　At the same time, everyone also understood that other countries were attempting to establish a peace that was not democratic, but imperialistic. This kind of peace would be the rule of some powerful countries over other large or small countries, disregarding their rights and national sovereignty.

　　It is easy to understand that the establishment of an imperialist peace inevitably leads to countries being divided into two levels: on the one hand, the ruling powers, and on the other hand, the subordinate, enslaved countries, and this in turn leads to new international conflicts and wars, which contain the danger of a third world war.

　　The desire to establish an imperialist peace naturally has to encounter opposition from many democratic countries.

　　I do not intend to conceal that the Soviet Union completely stands on the side of attempting to establish a democratic peace, and opposes attempts to force countries to accept an imperialist peace.

　　An imperialist peace cannot be solid. Only a peace built on a democratic foundation can be solid.

　　Therefore, the basic reasons for the division between yesterday's allies are clear at a glance.

　　This also applies to the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. The peace treaty with Germany is to determine the future fate of Germany. Naturally, the question arises as to whether this treaty will be based on the principles of a democratic or imperialist peace.

　　For the Soviet Union, which follows the peace policies of Lenin and Stalin, the answer is clear, and the answer can only be: the peace treaty with Germany must be based on the principles of democratic peace, and must contribute to Germany's economic recovery and its future restoration as an independent democratic country. In short, the peace treaty with Germany must be based on those principles that served as the basis for the decisions of the Yalta and Potsdam conferences for the Allied countries of Germany.

　　According to these decisions, we must demilitarize, democratize Germany, and at the same time ensure that Germany fulfills its obligations to other countries that have been invaded by the Hitler gang. A peace treaty drafted on this basis will allow Germany itself, after overcoming the current temporary difficulties, to resolutely embark on the road of economic recovery and development into a democratic and peace-loving country.

　　The countries governing Germany today have a major responsibility for the correct solution of these tasks, which are of great significance to all countries in the world.

　　Obviously, there are other different plans regarding Germany, the purpose of this plan is to prevent its economic recovery, for fear that it will become a competitor in the European and world markets. There is a policy adapted to this plan, the purpose of that policy is to destroy a unified Germany in order to weaken the German economy, even if this is not said publicly. In this case, there will be attempts by powerful countries to use Germany, these powerful countries need a certain part of German territory as a base. By first developing Germany's war industry and using the German reactionary forces as the pillar of this policy, the purpose of this policy is to rule the democratic countries of Europe and oppose the development of the democratic movement in the European countries liberated from fascism. Everyone understands that it is in this case that this policy represents the desire to establish an imperialist peace. From the perspective of democracy and European peace, this is a dangerous plan. This plan, which is aimed at opposing Germany's restoration as a unified democratic country and against the vital interests of the German people, only benefits the German reactionary revanchists, who are prepared to plagiarize the idea of German unity and use it for the revanchist purpose of dreaming of restoring an aggressive imperialist Germany.

　　In democratic countries, there should be no people who support this plan regarding Germany. In democratic countries, there should be even fewer people who support the following plan, which is an attempt to fantasize about using any part of German territory as a military or military-industrial base in order to carry out future military adventures in Europe; or as a bastion of European reactionary forces to oppose democratic forces in Germany or other European countries.

　　Only those people who support an imperialist peace can support this plan regarding Germany, but this plan will inevitably encounter opposition from many democratic countries. The Soviet Union - which has firmly defended and will defend the interests of restoring democratic peace in Europe and elsewhere, will naturally be a consistent enemy of this plan regarding Germany.

　　In preparing a peace treaty with Germany, we will first have to decide these basic issues.

　　If we find the correct solution to the issue of establishing a broad democratic government in Germany and deliberating on the future conference on this treaty, the preparation of the peace treaty with Germany will proceed smoothly. Naturally, there are also other issues included in the preparation of the treaty. However, the above two issues are of decisive importance.

　　We also have a basis for resolving these issues.

　　Regarding the establishment of a Foreign Ministers Meeting, the Potsdam Conference directly stated: "The meeting will be used to prepare a peaceful settlement for Germany, which will be accepted by the German government when a suitable German government is established." This decision of the Potsdam Conference must be implemented.

　　The issue of establishing a broad democratic government in Germany can no longer be delayed. This delay is not only harmful to the German people, but also to the people of other European countries, who are concerned with the early establishment of a solid peace throughout Europe.

　　As for the peace conference, we should reach an agreement here on the issue of the countries participating in the conference. Last year, at the New York Foreign Ministers Meeting, we unanimously decided which countries should be invited to participate in preliminary consultations when preparing the treaty. Later, the conference decided that in addition to the five powers, the Allied countries bordering Germany, as well as other countries that participated in the war against Germany with troops, should be invited to participate in the consultations.

　　Later, a proposal emerged that was completely contrary to this decision made at the New York Foreign Ministers Meeting. If we do not want to undermine the decision we have agreed to, then we should fulfill the New York decision, so that the issue of consultation in preparing the treaty and the issue of the members of the peace conference will be decided without difficulty.

　　If the above major issues are resolved (the preparation of the peace treaty with Germany cannot be completed without resolving these issues), all other issues related to the treaty will be decided without major delays.

　　The purpose of everything I have said here is to show: first, the importance of our past decisions for discussing the preparation of the peace treaty with Germany; second, to draw the Foreign Ministers Meeting's attention to the major issues arising therefrom.

　　In view of the importance of the issue, the Soviet delegation insists that this issue should be considered first among all issues related to Germany. I will remind the conference that as early as April 1946, the US government insisted on the most rapid preparation of the peace treaty with Germany, and this proposal was supported by the British and French delegations. However, at that time this issue could not be resolved because all attention was focused on the preparation of the first batch of five-nation treaties. But now, at the end of 1947, we have every possibility to directly start the preparation of the peace treaty with Germany, and we must not delay this important work with any excuse.

　　The Soviet government believes that the preparation of the peace treaty with Germany must be accelerated, and proposes to put this issue above other issues at this meeting. We do this based on the following facts: not only the Soviet Union, but also the people of other European countries, and not only the people of Europe, are concerned with the restoration of peace throughout Europe.

　　All this gives me reason to hope that our proposal will be supported by other delegations.

　　伦敦四外长会议上莫洛托夫发表演说
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据塔斯社伦敦二十七日电：二十六日，莫洛托夫在他任主席的外长会议上，发表对德和约问题的演讲。全文如下：
    我们已经决定讨论列在我们议程上的六个问题。其中有些是讨论德国和奥国和约的。这些问题没有同等的重要性。苏联代表团建议：准备对德和约问题，应在我们的议程上列于优先地位。
    因为苏联代表团发觉这一建议遭到反对，我们将更详细地说明我们的动机。
    苏联政府认为：对德和约的准备工作再不能延迟了。可以说，自德国投降以来，两年半的时间已经消逝了，但对这一问题却毫无进展。
    我们化了不少时间来准备对前德国五个同盟国的和约。最后，这个工作一般地是顺利完成了。对意大利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利和芬兰的和约已经付诸实行。和平发展的远景在这些国家的人民面前展开了，这一点不但符合这些人民的愿望，而且也符合在欧洲建立巩固的和平的利益。
    现在，决定对德和约的电动机已经到来了。如果外长会议延迟这一问题的决定，并把它列入会议的次要问题中，那就没有一个人会谅解我们。同时，我们也必须解决奥地利问题。这是这次外长会议必须解决的任务之一。
    我们已经决定在这次会议上讨论有关德国的若干问题。其中有属于当前临时性质的重要问题，应该予以严重的注意。但是对德的基本问题却是和约问题。由于外长会议的时间被若干其他迫切问题所占，所以直到现在难于开始进行这一和约的准备工作。
    可是，在另一方面，现在再不能把这一问题搁置起来了。
    我们全都认识：对德和约问题是德国的命运问题，同时也是完全恢复欧洲和平的问题。需要这一和约的不仅德国而已，整个欧洲（而且不仅是欧洲）的各族人民都需要它，能不能否认欧洲人民渴望最后在整个欧洲建立巩固的和平呢？而这是十分容易理解的，因为没有在欧洲建立最后的和平，就不可能有巩固的普遍的和平。
    自然，对德和约问题不是一个简单的问题，而且在讨论它的过程中，在我们之间将有某些分歧的意见，不过延迟这一问题的解决，决不能使问题更易于解决。
    正如大家所周知的，在战后时期中，在某些具有国际重要性的问题上，一方面苏联及对苏友好的民主国家，另一方面美国及某些西欧国家两者之间，常有分歧意见。
    在这一方面，战时的情况与战后的情况有巨大的不同。
    什么东西可以说明目前这种分歧的原因呢？分歧的基础何在呢？
    在第二次世界大战过程中，英、美、苏及其他民主各国，形成了反希特勒的联盟，共同进行反对法西斯国家阵营的解放战争，法西斯国家阵营追求世界统治及建立全世界的法西斯制度。这一斗争团结了它们，容许它们有效地决定许多有国际重要性的复杂问题。我们只要指出像三强德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨顿会议这类事实，就足够说明这一点了，而三强会议的著名决定，已变成对于各国历史的重要贡献。
    第二次世界大战结束后，情况就变了，这时候大家明白：从前参加反法西斯联盟的国家，对于建立战后和平问题具有不同的目的。
    大家明白：有些国家力图建立以各国平等及承认大国和小国主权平等为基础的民主的和平。这种和平提供了发展各国间（不论其社会制度及思想意识有何不同）和平合作的机会。建立民主的和平也意味着：战败国也有自由的民主的发展以及完全恢复主权的权利。
    同时，大家也明白：另一些国家企图建立不是民主的，而是帝国主义的和平。这种和平将会是某些强国统治其他大国或小国，蔑视它们的权利和国家主权。
    人们很容易了解：帝国主义和平的建立，不可避免地导向各国分成两级：一方面是统治强国，另一方面是从属的、受奴役的国家，而且这反过来又导向新的国际冲突和战争，这种冲突和战争，包含有第三次世界大战的危险。
    建立帝国主义和平的愿望，自然不得不遭遇许多民主国家方面的反对。
    我不拟隐讳：苏联是完全站在企图建立民主和平方面的，而且反对以帝国主义和平强迫各国接受的企图。
    帝国主义的和平不可能是巩固的。只有建立在民主基础上的那种和平，才能是巩固的。
    因此，昨天的同盟者间的分歧之基本原因何在，就了如指掌了。
    这也适用于对德和约问题。对德和约就是决定德国未来的命运。自然，发生了究竟这个和约将以民主的抑或帝国主义的和平的原则为基础的问题。
    对于遵循列宁和斯大林和平政策的苏联，答复是明晰的，而且这个答复只能是：对德和约必须以民主和平的原则为基础，而且必须有助于德国之经济恢复及其将来恢复为一个独立的民主国家。简言之，对德和约必须以作为雅尔塔、波茨顿会议对德国同盟国的决定之基础的那些原则为基础。
    根据这些决定，我们必须使德国非军国主义化，民主化，而且同时保证德国履行对遭受希特勒匪帮侵略的其他各国的义务。根据这一基础草拟的和约，将允许德国自己在克服目前的暂时困难之后，坚决地走上经济恢复和发展成民主的爱好和平国家的道路。
    对于对举世各国具有重大意义的这些任务的正确解决，管制今日德国的各国，负有主要责任。
    显然还有关于德国的别的不同的计划，这个计划的目的在于阻止它的经济恢复，因为生怕它变成欧洲及世界市场的竞争者。有一种政策是与这种计划适应的，那种政策的目的在求毁灭一个统一的德国，以削弱德国的经济，纵使这一点并没有公开的说出来。在这种情况下，就将有强国利用德国的企图，这些强国需要德国某一部分领土作为基地。以首先发展德国战争工业及作为这种政策的支柱的德国反动势力，而这一政策的目的，在求统治欧洲各民主国家，反对从法西斯主义解放出来的欧洲各国的民主运动之发展。大家明白：也就是在这种情况下，这种政策表示了建立帝国主义和平的愿望。从民主及欧洲和平的利益看起来，这是危险的计划。这一目的在反对德国恢复为统一的民主国家，反对德国人民的生死攸关的利益的计划，只有利于德国的反动复仇主义者，他们准备剽窃德国统一的思想，并为了梦想恢复侵略的帝国主义德国的复仇目的而加以利用。
    在民主国家中，不应有支持这个关于德国的计划的人。在民主国家中，更不应有支持下述计划的人，这一计划是一种企图，忘想利用德国任何部分领土作为军事或军事工业基地，以便在欧洲进行未来的军事冒险；或作为欧洲反动势力的堡垒，以反对德国或其他欧洲各国的民主势力。
    只有支持帝国主义和平的那些人们，才能支持这种关于德国的计划，可是这个计划不可避免地将遭遇许多民主国家方面的反对。苏联——它曾经坚毅地保卫并将保卫在欧洲及欧洲以外各地恢复民主和平的利益，自然将是这个关于德国的计划底始终不渝的敌人。
    在准备对德和约中，我们首先将必须决定这些基本问题。
    如果我们发现在德国建立广泛民主政府问题及审议这一和约的未来和会问题的正确解决办法，对德和约的准备工作，即将顺利进行。自然，也还有包括在和约准备工作中的其他问题。不过上述两个问题却具有决定的重要性。
    我们也有解决这些问题的基础。
    关于建立外长会议，波茨顿会议曾直接声称：“会议将被用以准备德国之和平解决方案，此将在合乎目的之德国政府成立时，由德国政府予以接受”。波茨顿会议的这一决定，必须实现。
    建立德国广泛的民主政府问题，再不能延迟解决了。这种延迟不但有害德国人民，而且对于与早日建立整个欧洲巩固和平利害攸关的欧洲其他各国人民，亦是有害的。
    至于和会，我们应在此就和会参加国问题求得协议。去年，在纽约外长会议上，我们曾一致决定了那些国家应在准备和约时被邀请参加初步咨商。后来会议决定：除了五强之外，与德国接壤的各同盟国家，以及以军队参加对德作战的其他国家，应被邀参加咨商。
    后来，出现了与纽约外长会议所作这一决定完全抵触的建议。如果我们不想破坏我们已同意的决定，那么我们应该履行纽约决定，从而和约准备时的咨商问题与和会成员问题，都会毫无困难地作出决定。
    如果上述主要问题解决了（这些问题不解决就不可能完成对德和约的准备工作），有关和约的其他一切问题，就会不受大的延缓而作出决定。
    我在此所说的每一件事的目的，在于显示：第一、我们过去的决定对于讨论对德和约准备工作的重要性；第二、使外长会议注意因此而生的主要问题。
    鉴于问题的重要，苏联代表团坚持：这一问题应在有关德国一切问题中首先予以考虑。我将提醒会议：早在一九四六年四月，美国政府就已坚持最迅速地准备对德和约，这个建议得到英法代表团的支持。可是，那时候这个问题不能解决，因为一切注意力都集中在第一批五国和约的准备工作上。但是现在，一九四七年的年底，我们有一切可能来直接开始对德和约的准备工作，勿庸以任何借口来延迟这一重要工作。
    苏联政府认为：对德和约的准备工作必须加速进行，并建议把这一问题列于这次会议的其他问题之上，我们这样做，是根据下一事实来的：不仅苏联，而且其他欧洲各国人民，而且不仅欧洲人民都与恢复全欧的和平利害攸关。
    所有这些，使我有理由希望我们的建议，将得到其他代表团的支持。
