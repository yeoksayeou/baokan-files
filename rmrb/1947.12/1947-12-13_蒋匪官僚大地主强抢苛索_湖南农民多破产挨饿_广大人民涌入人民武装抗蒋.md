Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th. "When Hunan and Guangxi are ripe, the whole world is fed," this has become a sharp irony under the current tyranny of Chiang Kai-shek in Hunan. Hunan has suffered consecutive disasters from Chiang Kai-shek's conscription, treasure extraction, and exorbitant taxes, coupled with natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and epidemics. Farmland is barren, industry and commerce are declining, people are displaced, and the entire social economy faces a profound crisis. In the past, Hunan could produce over 168.8 million piculs of grain in good years, of which over 50 million piculs could be exported. By 1945, production had fallen to only 67.7 million piculs. Not only could it not be exported, but last year more than 5 million people were plunged into famine.

The most profound manifestation of this severe economic crisis is the bankruptcy of the rural economy. First, land is being concentrated on a large scale. Owner-farmers and small and medium landlords are forced to sell their land in large numbers due to the pressures of life, causing land prices to plummet. Before the Anti-Japanese War in Hengyang, each mu of land sold for over 20 piculs of grain, but last year it was only worth 2.43 piculs, only one-tenth of the pre-war value. Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt officials, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry took the opportunity to buy up large amounts of land, forming a phenomenon of "fields stretching for miles." These bureaucratic landlords then exploited the peasants with extremely high rents, generally around 70% of the yield. In addition to this huge rent, the peasants also suffered from exorbitant taxes, local tyrants of Chiang Kai-shek's ilk, and various extortions, and had to resort to usurious loans. The highest interest rates reached 15 times the principal within a year. Coupled with the high cost of fertilizers, farm tools, and living expenses, the cost of planting 30 piculs of grain would be more than 43 piculs, resulting in a net loss of more than 13 piculs. Therefore, peasants are unwilling to farm, and the amount of abandoned land has greatly increased. In Hengyang, Lingling, and Qiyang counties, the abandoned land reached more than 760,000 mu, accounting for one-quarter of the cultivated area, and the remaining three-quarters also had poor harvests, only one-third to one-half of the normal year's yield. In the countryside, middle peasants, rich peasants, and small landlords also fell into bankruptcy under Chiang Kai-shek's grain requisition, conscription, and forced donations. The large-scale separation of tenant farmers from the land has created a huge number of starving people who have neither land nor the ability to rent land. Among the 380 households in the Fourth Bao of the Western Township of Xiangxiang County, 272 households are such starving people. They only make a living by doing odd jobs, pushing carts, and chopping firewood. Those who have no other way out wander into the cities, the elderly become beggars, and the young and strong mostly join the people's armed forces.

Business is also sluggish in all cities, and stores are closing down one after another. The reasons for this phenomenon are: first, the purchasing power of the people has decreased. The peasants, who account for more than 80% of the total population, are in a state of starvation and cold, and public employees are hovering on the brink of starvation. Where do they have money to buy things? In addition, the market interest rates are high, generally as high as 2.2% per month. Borrowing 10,000 yuan at the beginning of the year requires repaying 80,000 yuan at the end of the year. Merchants have difficulty in capital turnover, and moreover, the expenses for food and rent are huge, and Chiang Kai-shek's donations and taxes are heavy, so stores cannot but close down in large numbers. Hengyang had more than 10,000 stores during the war, but by the end of last year there were only 1,472, only one-seventh of the wartime number. And last year, 117 of the 15 industries waiting for employment and closing down accounted for 13%. Before the war, Qiyang had 2,500 stores, but now there are only more than 500, and all of them are small capital ventures of tens of thousands of Chiang coins. Xiangtan was the least damaged city in Hunan Province during the Anti-Japanese War, but since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, 274 of the 18 industries represented by silk and cloth have closed down, accounting for 30%. The originally famous export goods, rice, oil, and tea, have seen their output and sales plummet under the control of Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic capital and low-price purchases. The world-renowned tungsten and antimony mining industries have also almost completely shut down. The light and heavy industries in Changsha, Hengyang, and other places have also mostly closed down and ceased operations. What follows is a large number of unemployed workers. In Xiangtan alone, 48,000 workers are unemployed, accounting for two-thirds of the original workers. Including the workers' families, a total of 200,000 people have no means of living.

Under this severe economic crisis in Hunan, only the Chiang Kai-shek gang, an integrated group of bureaucrats, landlords, and big merchants, is still indulging in extravagance and continuing to extract every ounce of marrow. Under the heavy oppression and exploitation, a large number of peasants and workers are heroically resisting and pouring into the people's armed forces. Recently, in Daoxian and Jianghua in southern Hunan, Pingjiang and Xiangyin in northern Hunan, and Chaling and Youxian on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, the people's armed forces, in teams of dozens to hundreds of people, are unusually active. The flames of resisting Chiang and seeking survival are burning all over Hunan Province.

### 蒋匪官僚大地主强抢苛索  湖南农民多破产挨饿  广大人民涌入人民武装抗蒋

    蒋匪官僚大地主强抢苛索
    湖南农民多破产挨饿
    广大人民涌入人民武装抗蒋
    【新华社华东十日电】“湖广熟天下足”，这对现在蒋匪暴政下的湖南，已经成为尖锐的讽刺。湖南连年遭受蒋匪征兵、征宝、苛捐杂税等惨祸，加上水旱疫病等天灾，田地荒芜、工商凋敝、人民流离失所、整个社会经济面临深重危机。湖南过去丰年可产粮一万六千八百余万石，可输出五千余万石。至三十四年仅产六千七百余万石，不但不能输出，去年尚有五百多万人陷入粮荒。
    这样严重的经济危机，表现得最深刻的是农村经济的破产。首先是土地大量集中。自耕农与中小地主为生活所迫，大批出售土地，引起田价狂跌。衡阳抗战前每亩地售二十余石谷，去年仅值二点四三石，只及抗战前十分之一。蒋匪贪官污吏豪绅恶霸乘机大量收购，形成了“田连阡陌”的现象。这些官僚大地主，又以极高的佃租剥削农民，一般均在产量十分之七左右。农民除了这庞大的佃租以外，还要受苛捐杂税地方土蒋的各种敲诈，不得不向高利贷伸手。利息最高者一年之内高达本金十五倍，又加肥料、农具及生活费用高涨，种三十石谷田的成本，就要四十三石多，反要倒贴十三石多血本。因此农民不愿种田，荒芜土地大增，衡阳、零陵、祁阳三县，荒田达七十六万余亩，占耕地面积四分之一，其余四分之三也收成歉薄，仅及常年三分之一到二分之一。农村中的中、富农和小地主，在蒋匪征粮、征兵、强捐硬索之下，也陷入破产境地。加上佃农的大批脱离土地，造成巨量既无地，又无法佃种的饥民。湘乡县西乡四保三百八十户中，就有二百七十二家这样的饥民。他们只以做零工、推车、砍柴生活，没有办法的便流浪入城市，年老沦为乞丐，年轻力壮的多投入了人民武装。
    各城市也都生意萧条，商店纷纷倒闭。造成这种现象的原因：第一是人民购买力降低。占总人口百分之八十以上的农民，陷入饥寒交迫之中，公教人员徘徊在饥饿线上，那有钱来买东西？又加上市场拆息高，普通都要月息大二分。年初借一万元，年终还八万元。商人资金周转不灵，况且食用、房租开销巨大，蒋匪捐税繁重，商店不能不大批倒闭。衡阳战时有商店一万多家，去年年底只剩一千四百七十二家，仅及战时七分之一。而去年南货等十五个待业倒闭的即有一百十七家，占百分之十三。祁阳战前有二千五百家商店，现仅五百余家，而且都是蒋币几十万元的小资本。湘潭是抗战中湖南省城市中受损失最轻的一个，但抗战胜利以来，绸布等十八个待业代表团与停业的，就有二百七十四家占百分之三十。原来著名的出口货米、油与茶叶，在蒋匪官僚资本统制与低价收购下，产量与销路都一落千丈。驰名全球的钨锑矿业也几乎全部停顿。长沙、衡阳等地的轻重工业，也大都倒闭歇业。随之产生的是大批失业工人，湘潭一地即有四万八千工人失业，占原有工人三分之二，连工人家属共有二十万人生活无着。
    湖南在这种严重经济危机之下，只有官僚、大地主、大商人三位一体的蒋匪帮还在奢靡挥霍，继续敲骨吮髓的搜刮。在重重的剥削压迫下，大量农民、工人正英勇反抗，涌入人民武装。最近湘南道县、江华、湘北平江、湘阴、湘赣边境茶陵、攸县等地，数十至数百人一队的人民武装异常活跃，反蒋求生的烽火，正燃遍湖南全省。
