Nanweiquan Base Point

　　Central Cooperative Organizes to Find Production Avenues

[Our newspaper’s dispatch from Licheng] The Nanweiquan base point, according to the recent situation in various villages, reveals that some livestock are unable to find work, and the masses are generally reflecting that there is no way to make money. It was decided to establish a central cooperative to organize transportation and production. Jia Fushun said: "The establishment of a central cooperative is not solely for profit. I used to be in a small cooperative, and I wasn't clear about serving the masses. I just wanted to sell some groceries and medicines. After a year, after expenses, I didn't make much, and I didn't get the support of the masses. In the second half of this year, the cooperative put down its burden and faced the masses, going to Handan, Xingtai, and other places to find work for the masses. In this way, the labor and livestock of the whole village could maintain their livelihood every day, and the masses benefited greatly and gained their support. We should organize the central cooperative in this way." After discussion, the direction was clarified. On the sixth day of the lunar month, they began to wholesale Codonopsis pilosula and peppercorns in Handan and Xingtai, and wholesale coal in Wuxiang kiln, organizing the masses to deliver it. The central cooperative overcomes all difficulties in the production of the masses. At present, various villages are organizing the masses to buy shares. (Peng Jianwen, Fifth District of Licheng)

　　南委泉基点
  　组织中心社找生产门路
    【本报黎城讯】南委泉基点，根据最近各村情况，有的牲口找不到脚，群众普遍反映：想赚钱没有门路，研究成立中心合作社，组织运输生产。贾福顺说：“成立中心合作社，不是光为了营利，我以前在小型合作社，不明确为群众，光想卖点杂货药品，一年算下，除开支也不赚多少，还得不到群众拥护，今年后半年合作社放下包袱，面向群众，到邯郸、邢台等地，给群众揽脚，这样全村的劳畜力，每天才不缺生活，群众得利很大，也得到群众拥护。咱组织中心合作社，就照这样办就行。”经过讨论，明确了方向。阴历初六日已开始到邯郸、邢台批发党参、花椒，到武乡窑上批煤炭，组织群众送。中心合作社克服群众生产中一切困难。现各村正在组织群众入股。　　　　（黎城五区彭建文）
