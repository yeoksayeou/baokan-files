Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 21st: Sofia dispatch: On the 17th, Bulgaria and Albania signed a twenty-year treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, as well as treaties on cultural cooperation and economic and trade relations. The treaties stipulated close cooperation between the two countries in all aspects and the adoption of all necessary measures to ensure the security, independence, and territorial integrity of both countries. They specifically stipulated that if either contracting party is attacked by another country and its independence is endangered, the other party shall immediately provide military and other assistance. The treaties were signed by Albanian Prime Minister Hoxha and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov. To this end, the two countries issued a joint communiqué on the 18th, stating: "This treaty, like the previously concluded treaties between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, and Albania and Yugoslavia, aims to uphold and consolidate peace in the Balkans and friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania, as well as the various nationalities of the Balkans. After considering the international situation, the two delegations are determined to fight for the interests of defending democracy and opposing imperialism, to oppose instigators of new wars, and to resolutely counter provocations and aggression from any party." The communiqué announced that the United Nations Balkan Committee would not be allowed to enter the country because it violated the United Nations Charter and harmed the sovereignty of the Balkan countries. The communiqué expressed deep sympathy for the Greek people striving for independence and freedom, and believed that only a free and independent Greece could contribute to the establishment of lasting peace in the Balkans. The communiqué expressed anger at the imperialist bloc's rejection of Albania and Bulgaria's accession to the United Nations. During the two delegations' stay in Plovdiv, Dimitrov delivered a speech in which he particularly pointed out: "The magnificent edifice of people's democracy, people's prosperity and happiness, and lasting peace between countries is being built in Yugoslavia, Albania, Romania, and many other democratic countries." After explaining that imperialism is trying to undermine the foundation of the United Nations, Dimitrov declared: "The imperialist reactionaries are undermining the foundations of world peace and are preparing for new wars of aggression. The will of the peoples of all nationalities, our historical mission, and the interests of our future generations all require us to take steps ourselves, join hands, and use common efforts, by peaceful means, or, when necessary, by arms, to defend our freedom and independence. The time when imperialism danced the devil's dance on our Balkan land is gone forever."

　　保阿密切合作订立互助条约
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】索菲亚讯：十七日保（加利亚）阿（尔巴尼亚）两国在保国普罗夫迪夫城签订了二十年友好合作与互助条约。文化合作条约及经济商务关系条约。决定两国在一切方面的密切合作，并采取各项必要步骤以确保两国之安全、独立与领土完整，并具体规定当缔约国一方遭到其他国家之攻击而独立遭受危害时，另一方当即予以军事及其他各项援助。条约由阿总理霍查和保总理季米特洛夫签字。两国为此并于十八日发表联合公报称：“本约与先前缔约的保南、阿南条约均以拥护与巩固巴尔干和平及保南阿人民以及巴尔干各民族间的友谊与合作为宗旨。两国代表团于考虑了国际局势之后，决心为保卫民主与反帝国主义的利益而奋斗，反对新战争的挑拨者，坚决反击来自任何一方的挑拨与侵略。”公报宣布不允许联合国巴尔干委员会入境，因为它违反联合国宪章与损害巴尔干各国的主权。公报对于争取独立自由的希腊人民寄以深切同情，并认为只有自由与独立的希腊，才能对巴尔干持久和平的建立有所贡献。公报对于帝国主义集团摒拒阿保加入联合国一事表示愤怒。当两国代表团逗留普罗夫迪夫之际，季米特洛夫曾发表演说，其中特别指出：“人民的民主，人民的繁荣与幸福，以及各国间持久和平的辉煌大厦，正在南、阿、罗及其他许多民主国家建造中。”季氏在说明帝国主义力图破坏联合国的基础后，宣称：“帝国主义反动派正在破坏世界和平的基础，而且准备新的侵略战争。各民族人民的意志，我们历史的使命，以及我们后代子孙的利益，均要求我们自己采取步骤，携起手来，用共同的努力，与和平的手段，或者必要时用武装来保卫我们的自由与独立。帝国主义在我们巴尔干的土地上跳恶魔舞的时候已经一去不复返了。”
