    [Report from This Newspaper's Taiyue Office, 16th] The Tunliu Industrial Tax and Banking economic departments are fully supporting the production of the poor and hired laborers, transporting three thousand bolts of homespun cloth to Shanxi Northwest to exchange for livestock. The county's Production Committee first mobilized the masses to invest in homespun cloth for export, exchanging it for livestock in Shanxi Northwest. Comrade Wang Jiangong of the County Cooperative was selected to lead a group of sixteen representatives elected by the masses from various districts, dividing them into groups by district. On December 9th, they took 3,058 bolts of cloth to the Northwest. Each bolt of cloth was 4.4 zhang long, totaling 135,552 chi. Each chi was valued at 160 yuan (including 40 yuan per chi for transportation and expenses), totaling 21,683,320 yuan. Each livestock animal averaged 100,000 yuan, allowing for the exchange of 217 livestock animals. Estimating a profit of 30,000 yuan per animal, a profit of 6,510,000 yuan could be made, equivalent to 465 shi of millet. In addition, the county's Production Committee also sent Song Minzhi from the Industrial Tax Bureau and Zhang Wuying from the Bank to Changzhi to contract the transportation of 1.5 million jin of rails for the masses, transporting them from Hongdong to Changzhi, earning a total of 127.5 million yuan in transportation fees. An advance of 35 million yuan for return transportation costs has already been disbursed to various districts on December 9th. The County Cooperative's Yang Tingjun, Jia Jingwen, and Xu Shichang from the Industrial Tax Bureau have been assigned to organize the masses for transportation. Currently, 5,000 carts from Weijia and Dongnao villages in the first district, as well as carts from various districts, have begun transportation, and it is planned to complete the transportation in its entirety within one month. The Changcun base point in the second district is also organizing vehicles to contract the transportation of 1,500 rails, with a transportation fee of 5,000 yuan per rail, which can earn 7.5 million yuan in one month. The above two items total a profit of 135 million yuan, equivalent to 9,640 shi of millet (including expenses). Various districts are also actively organizing the masses to burn nitrate ash to expand the production of nitrate. In November, a total of 10,350 jin of nitrate was produced, more than one and a half times more than the previous month. Based on the ash sent by various villages, it is estimated that 15,000 jin of nitrate can be produced in December, which, at 650 yuan per jin, totals 9.75 million yuan, equivalent to 696 shi of millet. Based on the above situation, Tunliu's plan to increase nitrate production by 20,000 jin in one month can be fully realized. To further address the difficulties of the poor and hired laborers, the bank has allocated 33.5 million yuan in poverty relief loans. Bank cadres, in coordination with key cadres from various systems, went to the countryside on December 10th with the loans to investigate the difficulties in the production of the poor and hired laborers, issue loans, and organize mass production.
