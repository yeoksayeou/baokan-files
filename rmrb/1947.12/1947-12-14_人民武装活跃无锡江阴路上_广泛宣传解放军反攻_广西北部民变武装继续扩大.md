    Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 12th: Wuxi News: People's armed forces are active on the Wuxi-Jiangyin Highway. In mid-November, a unit of the people's armed forces suddenly attacked Changshou Town in the middle section of the road, killing Pan Zibao, the head of the KMT self-defense force. They then went to Chang'anqiao Town and captured three KMT secret agents. On November 19th, another unit of the people's armed forces stormed into Xicang Town north of Wuxi, disarming the Kuomintang self-defense team of more than 40 people, seizing the submachine guns of their instructors, Chen Dexing and another person, terrifying the enemy. The people's armed forces launched extensive propaganda along the towns and villages along the road, and slogans such as "People's Liberation Army Launches National Counteroffensive" and "The People Want to Live, Hoping for the New Fourth Army" were posted on both sides of the highway. The peasants' morale is extremely high. One farmer who raises a pig weighing more than eighty catties said, "No matter how difficult life is, I will not sell it. I will keep it to reward the New Fourth Army."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: According to a TASS report from Nanjing on December 11th, citing a Guilin correspondent of the Hong Kong Chinese Commercial Daily: People's uprisings have sprung up in northern Guangxi Province. Prior to this, people's armed forces in the southeastern part of the province had already expanded their activities violently. The panicked KMT Guangxi provincial authorities have adopted a cruel policy of slaughter against the people of northern Guangxi. As of early November, more than 500 residents and 11 students had been shot dead by the KMT. The KMT arrests people from all walks of life in northern Guangxi, especially teachers and students, and subjects them to inhuman torture, but the people's uprisings continue to expand.
