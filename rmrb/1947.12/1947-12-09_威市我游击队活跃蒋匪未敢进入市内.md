　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th. Chiang bandits, who originally invaded Weihaiwei, were deterred by the power of our guerrilla warfare and have not dared to enter the city. As of November 23rd, the sixth day after the People's Liberation Army's voluntary transfer (November 17th), two regiments of the 166th Brigade of Chiang's 8th Division were still lingering in the northern part of the city and several fishing villages behind the mountains. Their brigade headquarters was huddled in Heqing Village, ten miles north of Weihai City. Small groups of Chiang bandits who sneaked into the city were severely attacked by our active guerrillas and local armed forces. On the 25th of last month, a bandit ship had just entered the entrance of Liugong Island when it was repelled by our army.

　　威市我游击队活跃蒋匪未敢进入市内
    【新华社华东七日电】原图侵占威海卫之蒋匪，慑于我游击战威力，迄未敢进驻市内，截至十一月二十三日，即解放军主动转移（十七日）之第六日，蒋匪整八师一六六旅两个团仍徘徊于城北地区及山后几个渔村。其旅部蜷缩于威市北十里之合庆村。小股窜入市内之蒋匪，时遭我活跃于市内的游击队及地武痛击。上月二十五日，曾有匪舰一艘刚进入刘公岛门前，即被我军击退。
