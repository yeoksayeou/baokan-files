Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th - The Chiang bandits in Laiyang City, an isolated county deep within Jiaodong, have been continuously attacked by our local armed forces and militia. From the beginning of October to mid-November, in a month and a half, they have suffered over 160 attacks, resulting in the elimination, wounding, and capture of over 1,500 enemy troops, including the main force, security teams, local squads, and puppet self-defense forces. 320 landmines exploded, injuring over 340 enemy soldiers. Our local armed forces and militia have continuously improved their tactics. One unit, with just one company, routed a battalion of the Chiang bandit's 25th Division, pursuing them to the outskirts of Laiyang City, killing, wounding, and capturing over 30 enemy soldiers without any casualties on our side. The puppet organizations in the 62 villages surrounding the city have been destroyed by us, and 2,500 people who were deceived have escaped from the city. The armed work teams and demolition squads in the urban area frequently plant landmines in the enemy trenches and post slogans in the city. Small groups of enemies no longer dare to leave the city.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 11th - Since the Liberation Army entered the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway to fight, the local people have launched a zealous campaign to support the front and comfort the troops. One county, after equipping 300 stretchers for the front lines, temporarily added 1,200 more stretchers and 120 pack mules. The masses in one county continuously ground and milled over 2 million catties of millet and white flour for ten days and transported it to the front. Those transporting grain included young women and children, who were not afraid of the cold and traversed mountains and rivers with high morale. In Wulong (newly established county), over 1,000 people from eight villages helped the troops build a large bridge. In one village, women also participated in carrying stretchers to urgently rescue the wounded, deeply moving the injured soldiers. The broad masses spontaneously comforted the troops. In the ten villages of the Wan'di district alone, they sent twelve pigs, twenty-four sheep, as well as chickens, ducks, peanuts, and other items. Some even went up the mountains to hunt rabbits and fished in the water to send to our own troops.

    【新华社华东前线十一日电】解放军进入胶济东段作战后，当地人民掀起支前劳军热潮，某县配备三百付担架赴前线后，临时又增加一千二百付和一百二十个驮骡，某县群众连续十天扒碾小米、白面二百余万斤，并自动运往前方，运粮者还有青年妇女、儿童、他们不怕天寒地冻，跋山涉水，情绪高涨。五龙（新设县）八个村一千多群众帮助部队架设大桥，某村为急救伤员，妇女们也参加抬担架，伤员大受感动。广大群众自发劳军，仅玩底区十一个村就送了十二口猪，二十四头羊，还有鸡鸭花生等物，有的还特地上山打兔子下水摸鱼往自己队伍送。
