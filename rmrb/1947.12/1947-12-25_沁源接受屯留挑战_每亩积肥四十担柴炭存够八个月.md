　　[This Dispatch from Our Taiyue Correspondent on the 23rd] All cadres in Qin Yuan County are determined to lead the masses in winter production and compete with Tun Liu County. After receiving Tun Liu's challenge letter for winter production, the county's Production Committee and all Party, government, and civilian cadres were extremely excited and responded to the challenge with full confidence. They immediately convened a meeting to study the matter in detail and printed and distributed Tun Liu's challenge letter and the county's response to cadres at all levels, resolving to achieve significant results in the two major winter tasks (transport and weaving) and three minor tasks (collecting firewood, charcoal, and manure): (1) Taking the leadership of the county in launching a "Hundred-Day Ten Jin of Cotton" movement as a condition of the response, ensuring that every household spins cotton and every group organizes cloth production, with the county spinning 150,000 jin of cotton and weaving 2.5 million chi of homespun cloth with a width of 1.35 chi. In addition to self-use, 250,000 chi will be exported. Currently, there are 1,288 existing weavers in the county, and each person will train an apprentice, increasing the number to 2,256. There are currently 450 shuttle looms, which will be increased to 797, and an additional 500 accelerated spinning wheels will be added. (2) Do a good job in the "Three Accumulations" to ensure that next year's high-grade land receives 50 loads of manure, and low-grade land receives 40 loads of manure. Furthermore, this winter, all manure should be delivered to the fields, and enough firewood and charcoal should be stockpiled to burn for eight months. A movement to save a handful of rice and accumulate bran and vegetables per household per day will be launched. (3) The entire county will organize 2,000 laborers for transportation, with each person earning 2.5 shi of millet. 600 livestock will be organized, with each mule earning 6 shi of rice and each donkey earning 5 shi of rice. 550 carts will ensure that they are not idle this winter. (4) The entire county currently has 23 coal kilns, and five more will be added. Each kiln will produce an average of 80 loads of coal per day, and the 28 kilns will produce 2,240 loads per day, generating 56 shi of millet. Calculated over 60 days, this can generate 3,360 shi of millet, guaranteeing the supply of fuel for Qin Tun. Exporting 5,000 millstones will generate 500 shi of millet. Exporting carrying poles and baskets will generate 650 shi of millet. Exporting 200,000 jin of hemp and 100,000 jin of medicinal herbs will generate 80 million yuan. Exporting 20,400 jin of charcoal will generate 620,000 yuan. (5) The entire county will increase livestock by 300 heads and add and repair 200 carts.

　　[This Dispatch from Our Taiyue Correspondent on the 23rd] Han Hongji's model village in Qin Yuan has opened up transportation routes and is engaged in diverse production. After the model village arranged for winter production, each village formulated plans according to their specific circumstances, and they are currently actively implementing them. The model village has over 100 full and semi-able-bodied laborers, who are organized to go up the mountains to split willow strips. The cooperative has established relations with Xiang Yuan and has contracted for sales, with each jin of willow strips priced at 25 yuan. Buyers come to transport them themselves. Currently, 30,000 jin of willow strips have been split, which can earn a total of 750,000 yuan. Zheng Yi, Ze Shan, Wu Pang, and other villages are also organizing to go up the mountains to cut strips. Shang She Village has contracted for 20,000 hoe handles for a certain unit of the Taihang Mountains, priced at 100 yuan per handle, which can earn 2 million yuan. On the 2nd of this month, 50 people were organized to go up the mountains to cut. In addition, five donkeys were organized to transport goods within the village. At the same time, five old men contracted for 20 shi of millet for digging tiles at the kiln. Han Hongyang and Zhang Lai returned from a meeting in the district and, together with Yang Renyi, opened a charcoal kiln in three days. As long as the masses have the strength to dig, they can burn charcoal without paying. At the same time, they organized 13 people by region to dig kilns, and there are currently four sites that will soon be producing charcoal. Shang Wu Tou organized over 30 people to transport goods. The Ze Shan cooperative organized women and established a weaving training center. It is estimated that this winter, the model village's transportation, weaving, and various productions will have a surplus after meeting the needs for food and drink.
