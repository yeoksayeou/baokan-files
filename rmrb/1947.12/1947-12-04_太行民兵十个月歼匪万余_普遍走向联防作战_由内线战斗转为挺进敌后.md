Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 1st – The Taihang District Military Commission announced that the district's militia eliminated a total of more than 11,500 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops from January to October of this year, exceeding the original plan of eliminating 5,000 enemies for the entire year by more than double. They also captured four enemy strongholds, destroyed eighteen enemy bunkers, and recovered eighty-eight villages. They seized two mortars, forty small cannons, sixty machine guns, more than two thousand long and short guns, and captured more than two thousand six hundred head of livestock. The monthly increase in the number of enemies eliminated demonstrates the increasing combat effectiveness of the militia. The 3,500 enemies eliminated in September exceeded the 600 enemies eliminated in January by five times. In terms of tactics, they have also universally moved from decentralized operations to joint defense operations, transforming from internal combat to advancing behind enemy lines. The use of landmines to attack the enemy has become a mass movement, and small-scale annihilation battles are also increasing.
