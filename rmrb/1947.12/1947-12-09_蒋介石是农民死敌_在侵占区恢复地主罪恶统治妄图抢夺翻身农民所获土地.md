Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. News from Chiang-controlled area newspapers reveals that the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who represents the interests of China's reactionary feudal landlords, harbors extreme animosity towards the just land reforms of the liberated areas. In the Chiang-occupied areas, he uses all cruel methods to suppress peasants and restore the landlords' occupation of land and their sinister rule over the peasants. Wherever Chiang's troops go, they openly propose "Overthrowing the laboring masses' liberation, landlords and gentry raise their heads." The Chiang bandit "Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee" explicitly established "Land Rights Mediation Committees" in various "Pacification Zone Townships," everywhere assisting reactionary landlords and despots in forcibly seizing land acquired by peasants and carrying out massacres of liberated peasants. The so-called "Pacification Zone Administration Program" promulgated by Chiang bandit on October 16th of last year and the "Land Handling Measures in Pacification Zones" announced by the Chiang bandit Land Administration Department in January of this year have become the legal basis for these sinful acts. Both reactionary documents clearly stipulate that "land ownership still belongs to the landlords." The Chiang bandit Peiping Executive Headquarters re-promulgated on November 29th an order stating "Farmland in recovered areas (referring to Chiang-occupied areas) that is owned by owner-cultivators will be returned; non-owner-cultivated land will also be returned to the landlords." The reactionary face of Chiang bandit, the mortal enemy of the Chinese peasants, is now completely exposed. Chiang-controlled Jiangsu, Henan, and other provincial authorities all have similar reactionary proclamations. In the Chiang bandit's ruling areas, peasants live in extreme suffering under the dual oppression of high land rents and heavy taxes. Even the "25% rent reduction" that Chiang bandit has always paid lip service to has long been exposed by facts. According to Shanghai newspapers, at the end of last year, an incident occurred in Chongming County, Jiangsu Province, in which Kuomintang troops armed suppressed peasants who demanded "25% rent reduction." After Kuomintang rule replaced Japanese rule in Chongming, the peasants' lives not only did not improve in the slightest, but the amount of land rent paid increased even more. The landlords, in conjunction with the local county authorities, formed a "Rent Collection Office," which used various harsh methods to force peasants to pay rent. A local intellectual named Sheng Wuwei explained the meaning of "25%" rent reduction to the peasants based on the "25% Rent Reduction" decree that the Kuomintang Central Committee had promulgated long ago but never implemented, and the "25% Rent Reduction" proclamations issued by the county's Kuomintang government and county party headquarters. When the local Kuomintang authorities learned of this, they immediately ordered the First Company of the Logistics Battalion of the 21st Reorganized Division of the Army stationed in the area to arrest Sheng. The company commander, Ren Bili, later issued a notice stating that this was still a lenient punishment; if the local peasants had not collectively requested leniency for Sheng, he would have been subjected to even more severe punishment.

　　蒋介石是农民死敌
    在侵占区恢复地主罪恶统治妄图抢夺翻身农民所获土地
    【新华社陕北六日电】据蒋区报纸消息披露：代表中国反动封建地主利益的卖国贼蒋匪当局，对解放区农民正义的土地改革持以极端仇视态度，在蒋占区中则用一切残酷办法镇压农民，恢复地主对土地的占有和对于农民的罪恶统治。蒋匪军队所到之处公开提出“打倒工农翻身，地主豪绅抬头”，蒋匪“绥靖区政务委员会”明令成立之各地“绥靖区乡镇地权调处委员会”，到处协助反动地主恶霸强夺农民所获土地，并对翻身农民肆行杀戮，蒋匪去年十月十六日所公布之所谓“绥靖区施政纲领”及蒋匪地政署今年一月间所公布之“绥靖区土地处理办法”则成为这些罪恶行为的合法根据，该二反动文件皆明文规定“土地所有权仍归地主”。蒋匪北平行辕复于十一月二十九日再次明令公布“收复区（指蒋占区）农地是自耕农的发还，非自耕地亦发还地主”，蒋匪是中国农民死敌的反动面自己赤裸裸暴露出来。蒋区江苏、河南等省当局皆有此类似反动布告。在蒋匪统治区中，农民在高额地租和重重苛杂双重压榨下，生活痛苦不堪，即蒋匪所一向空言欺骗的“二五减租”也早已为事实所揭破。据沪报载：去年年底江苏崇明县内曾发生过国民党军队武装镇压农民要求“二五减租”的事件。崇明自日寇统治为国民党统治代替后，农民生活不但未见丝毫改善，地租缴纳量反变本加厉，地主结合当地县当局组成之“收租处”，以各种严厉办法强制农民缴租，当地有一农民知识分子名盛无畏者，即根据国民党中央早已颁布但从来不实行的“二五减租”法令，及该县国民党政府及县党部关于“二五减租”之布告，向农民阐述“二五”减租之意义，此事为当地国民党当局获悉，即令该地驻军陆军整编二十一师辎重营第一连将盛拘捕，该连连长任必烈事后并发表通告称：这还是从轻发落，如果不是当地农民为盛集体请求的话，将对盛施以更重之刑罚云。
