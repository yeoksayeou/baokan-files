    [This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, December 12th Dispatch] On November 29th, a portion of the enemy's 181st Brigade occupying Heze, along with over 3,000 "Returning Home Corps" from Cao (County), He (Ze), Pu (County), Yun (Cheng) and other places, looted grain in the Kangfengdian and Chenzhuang areas of the eighth district of Juancheng. The Juancheng Guerrilla Unit, upon hearing the news, confronted the enemy and after four hours of fierce fighting, retook Kangfengdian and Chenzhuang, inflicting sixteen casualties on the enemy, who then fled in disarray.

    [This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, December 12th Dispatch] The local armed forces of Yunju and Linze counties have continuously struck at the Chiang bandits who were looting grain, and a mass anti-grain-grabbing struggle has unfolded around Heze city. The Bian Luji Guerrilla Unit of the third district of Heze, in the twenty days from October 18th to November 8th, fought nine battles with the Chiang bandits of Heze, each time recovering all or most of the grain and other items looted by the Chiang bandits. On November 22nd, 300 "Returning Home Corps" members moved out from Heze and looted grain in the Tanhua and Liulou areas of the fourth district of Linze. The Yunju Brigade, in coordination with the armed forces of the fourth district of Linze, immediately rushed to the villages, and after a little over an hour of fierce fighting, killed or wounded twenty-one enemies and captured two. The remaining bandits desperately fled towards Heze, and all the grain they had looted was intercepted by us and returned to the masses. The first, second, and fifth districts of Linze and the first and second districts of Yunju have recently established joint defense systems on a wide scale. With the development of land reform in the border areas, joint defense is also developing and consolidating. Due to the active struggle of the military and civilians of Linze and Yunju, the Chiang bandits besieged on the "isolated island" of Heze are extremely panicked.

    [This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, December 10th Dispatch] The people's armed forces of our first sub-district have fought bravely for the past six months, achieving brilliant results. The people's armed forces of the Taixi sub-district on the south bank of the Yellow River have continuously inflicted heavy blows on the Chiang bandits, averaging four battles a day, and have produced the banner of the people's armed forces – the Jiang Qibao Guerrilla Unit. The people's armed forces also carried out land reform under extremely tense conditions. According to incomplete statistics, in the past six months (June to November), the Taixi people's armed forces fought over 800 battles, killing, capturing, and wounding 1,557 Chiang bandits, seizing one artillery piece, over 300 rifles and short guns, 30 war horses, over 10,000 rounds of ammunition, destroying two enemy vehicles, and recovering 8,845,000 catties of grain, 44 head of cattle, and 500 sheep.
