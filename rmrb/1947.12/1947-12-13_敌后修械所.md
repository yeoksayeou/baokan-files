    Repair Shop Behind Enemy Lines

    In the jagged guerilla warfare of Huxi, the Yang Zhijie Repair Shop, accompanying the Huxi guerilla fighters, burned with roaring flames day and night in the ant-nest-like tunnels within the heart of the Chiang bandits, clanging with iron hammers, forging cannons and guns for the fighters. In July, they intensified the sound of their hammers. On November 17th, when the Huxi local armed forces拔除 (Ba Chu) the Zhao Zhuang settlement stronghold, four recoilless guns were damaged. Repair workers braved bullets, rushed to the front lines, and repaired the cannons. Last August, the Huxi sub-district entered a tense guerilla warfare situation. The Yang Zhijie Repair Shop, in order to cope with the situation, had just buried their equipment when enemies appeared from all directions. In the heavy rain, they took up their guns and began a life of combat. At × Lou, they had just dug up the equipment when another situation arose. While fighting the enemy, they loaded vehicles and transported them, working all night in the mud. As soon as they buried it, guerilla fighters came to repair their guns, so they dug it up again. They often buried it during the day and had to dig it up at night to repair it. During the most critical ten days, through their resourcefulness, bravery, and diligence, they saved twenty cannons and one hundred light and heavy machine guns. In early October, when General Liu Bocheng痛击 (Tong Ji) the American-equipped Chiang army's 11th Division at Zhangfengji, the Yang Zhijie Repair Shop, due to the tense situation, suddenly lost contact with the sub-district, but they were not deterred by this emergency and retreated. Yang Zhijie found the × Column fighting on the front lines, and within three days they repaired forty-five light and heavy machine guns and two cannons. In December, when General Liu Bocheng fought fiercely at Jin (xiang) Yu (tai) amidst wind and snow, Yang Zhijie received an urgent order to quickly repair the cannons; they completed the task before even half of the allotted time had passed. Their pliers and hammers mixed with the gunfire of the front lines, and batches of damaged cannons and machine guns, after passing through their hands, were transformed into excellent weapons and sent to the front lines.

    敌后修械所
    在犬牙交错的湖西拉锯游击战争中，杨志杰修械所，伴随着湖西的游击战士们，在蒋匪心脏里的蚁穴般的地道层中，彻夜整天的燃着熊熊的火焰，叮铛的奏着铁锤，为战士们造炮造枪。七月间他们更加紧了铁锤的响声。十一月十七日，湖西地方武装拔除赵庄集大据点的时候，平射炮打坏了四个，修械工人冒着枪弹，跑到阵地上，把炮修好了。去年八月，湖西分区转入紧张的游击战争局面。杨志杰修械所为应付情况，东西刚埋好，四面八方就都有了敌人；他们在大雨中，拿着枪，开始了战斗的生活。在×楼，刚把东西扒出来，又来了情况。他们一面与敌人战斗着，一面装车转运，在泥水中整整的弄了一夜。刚埋藏好，游击队员们又来修枪了，再扒出来修理。他们常常是白天埋好，夜里还得扒出来修理。在最紧张的十天里，凭着他们的机智、勇敢、刻苦，保存了二十门大炮，一百挺轻重机枪。十月的上旬，刘伯承将军在张凤集痛击美械蒋军十一师的时候，杨志杰修械所因情况紧张，突然的与分区失掉了联系，但他们没有被这紧急的情况吓倒而撤退。杨志杰找到了正在前线作战的第×纵队，他们三天内修好四十五挺轻重机枪和两门大炮。腊月刘伯承将军在风雪交加中大战金（乡）鱼（台）的时候，杨志杰又接到了紧急的命令，赶快修理大炮；还没超过限定时间的一半，就完成任务。他们的钳子和锤头夹杂在火线的枪声里，一批一批毁坏了的大炮机枪，经过他们的手，又变为优良的武器，送到火线上去。（冀鲁豫分社）
