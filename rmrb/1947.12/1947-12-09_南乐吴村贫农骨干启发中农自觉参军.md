　　【Our Newspaper, JiluYu, 7th dispatch】In Nanle Wucun, the poor peasants, as the backbone, educated the middle peasants, universally convened family meetings, and conducted in-depth ideological mobilization, achieving complete voluntary enlistment. The work process is divided into two steps: After putting forward the enlistment task at the village's mass meeting, it entered the group deliberation stage. When discussing "Why fight Chiang Kai-shek?", everyone said: "Because he is a traitor, acting as America's puppet emperor. If we don't eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, our liberation will not be secure." However, when discussing "Who should fight Chiang Kai-shek?", some people initially had ideological difficulties. Some said: "Those who get more fruits should go." Others said: "Cadres should go." But "Everyone has a share in enlisting to fight Chiang Kai-shek, so who should go?" Poor peasant Shi Lian’san said: "Is enlisting completely a matter for the poor peasants? Don't the middle peasants also have a share? During the eight years of Japanese devils' oppression, which poor and middle peasant didn't suffer? If Chiang Kai-shek wants to sell the country and make us slaves, the middle peasants can't avoid being slaves either. The poor peasants suffer exploitation from the landlords, but aren't the middle peasants also having a hard time?" From these words of the poor peasant, the middle peasants received great inspiration and education, and their awareness was further enhanced, recognizing that "The middle peasants also have a share in enlisting to fight Chiang Kai-shek." In the gradually deepening discussions, men, women, old and young all felt that "fighting Chiang Kai-shek is their own responsibility." In the process of discussion, many young people realized: "Everyone has a share in enlisting to fight Chiang Kai-shek." Many young people were willing to sign up to join the army. However, they were not allowed to sign up immediately at that time, but it was decided that they should all go home and have good family meetings, so that their parents and wives would happily send them to join the army. When Shi En’yuan held a family meeting, he first mobilized his mother, saying: "We have a share in enlisting to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and I am young, who will go if I don't? Anyway, even if I leave, someone will take care of the family." The mother thought it over and said: "Go ahead, what else should young people do at home if they don't fight Chiang Kai-shek?" At night, he discussed with his wife: "We also have a share in enlisting, and I have decided to go." When his wife heard that he was going to join the army, she cried loudly. He patiently persuaded her: "Why are you crying? What difficulties do you have? Someone will cultivate the land on your behalf, and someone will take care of the odd jobs at home. If I join the army and defeat Chiang Kai-shek sooner, won't we live in peace and happiness! So why are you crying?" His wife was persuaded by him, and the next day happily sent him to register.

　　南乐吴村贫农骨干启发中农自觉参军
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】南乐吴村贫农为骨干，教育中农，普遍召开家庭会议，深入思想发动，达到完全自觉自愿参军。其工作经过共分两步：在全村群众大会上，提出参军任务后，就进入小组酝酿，当讨论：“因为啥打老蒋”时，大家都说：“因为他卖国，当美国的儿皇帝，不消灭老蒋咱翻身不牢靠。”但讨论到“打老蒋该谁去”时，开始因为许多人思想不通，有的说：“得果实多的人该去”。有的说：“干部应该去。”可是“参军打老蒋，咱们都有份，到底谁去呢？”贫农史连三说：“参军是不是完全是贫农的事？是不是中农也有一份？八年日本鬼子的压榨，中贫农谁没受过？蒋介石要卖国要叫咱当亡国奴，中农也不能不当。贫农受地主剥削，中农不是也不好过吗？”从贫农这些话中，中农得到了很大的启发与教育，觉悟进一步提高，认识到：“参军打老蒋，中农也有一份”。在逐步深入的讨论中，男女老少都感到“打老蒋是自己的责任。”在讨论过程中，许多青壮年都认识到：“参军打老蒋，人人都有份。”许多青壮年都愿意报名参军了。可是当时没让他们马上报名，而决定都回家去很好的开家庭会，让自己的父母妻子都高高兴兴的送自己参军。史恩远开家庭会时，先动员母亲说：“参军打老蒋，咱有一份，咱又是青年，咱不去叫谁去呢？反正我走了，家里总会有人照顾。”母亲想开了说：“去吧，年青人不打老蒋在家干啥？”夜晚他又跟老婆商量：“参军咱也有份，我决定要去。”老婆一听说他要参军，就大哭，他耐心的劝解：“你哭啥？你有啥难题？地里的活有人代耕，家里的零星活也有人照顾，我参军把老蒋早点打倒，回来咱不是尽过太平日子了！你说你哭啥？”老婆被他说服了，第二天高高兴兴的送他去报了名。
