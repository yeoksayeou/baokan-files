　　Moscow Radio Exposes:
  　American Imperialism is Supporting Japanese Zaibatsu to Collectively Enslave the Chinese People
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th】Moscow Radio broadcast a commentary by Masinu on the 8th, pointing out that American monopoly capitalists are supporting Japanese zaibatsu to re-invade China and enslave the Chinese people. The full text is as follows:
    The following three pieces of news were released almost simultaneously: On November 27th, United Press reporters quoted official sources as saying: The US State Department, the War Department, and other government agencies are now planning to re-examine the issue of Japan's largest monopoly organizations (such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui). The next day, November 28th, the New York World Review magazine published a dispatch from Tokyo, stating: General MacArthur's economic advisors are preparing a Marshall Plan for Japan. Five days later (December 3rd), the London Broadcasting Corporation quoted the Associated Press from Shanghai as saying: The Chinese (Chiang) government has approved the resumption of trade relations with Japan and will soon send a group of government-approved businessmen to Japan. These three pieces of news appearing almost simultaneously are not accidental, because the issue of Japanese zaibatsu, the issue of Sino-Japanese trade relations, and the issue of the American plan for Japan are closely linked to each other.
    If we examine the development history of Japanese monopoly organizations, such as the local development history of Mitsubishi and Mitsui, it is not difficult to find two characteristics of their development: The first characteristic is: the source of their wealth is the economic and military aggression and colonial plunder against the peoples of Asia and the Far East—first and foremost the Chinese people. They were the backstage bosses of Japanese imperialism, they armed the Japanese army, and they financially supported the Japanese invasion of China. The Japanese zaibatsu used military force to seize the Chinese market for raw materials and sales of goods, turning China into a Japanese colony. The second characteristic is that the Japanese zaibatsu could not have grown without the help of American and British monopoly capitalists. Millard's Review commented on a news item on June 30, 1934, saying: Morgan Bank supported Japan's aggression against China. The magazine pointed out: Morgan financially helped Japan's aggression against Manchuria. It emphasized: Morgan Bank attempted to provoke a war in the Far East, help Japan build a military industry, and plunder Korea, Manchuria, and North China. American monopoly capitalists who made their fortune at that time attempted to divide China with Japanese monopoly capitalists and make it invade the Soviet Union. The World Review magazine said on November 28th of this year: The "Marshall Plan for Japan" is actually just a continuation of the old policy of American monopoly capitalists on a new basis. Previously, the purpose of American monopoly capital's aid to Japanese zaibatsu was only to use the actions of Japanese zaibatsu to turn China into a joint colony of the United States and Japan.
    Therefore, according to a United Press report: The US State Department, the War Department, and other government agencies are now re-examining the issue of dissolving large Japanese monopoly groups such as "Mitsubishi and Mitsui." According to official sources, the dispatch continued: The main issue is to allow Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and other financial giants to continue their activities while not allowing them to directly control Japan, but to control Japan in the hands of American capitalists. This proposition is very clear: Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and other financial tycoons are experienced partners of the United States in implementing colonial plunder and enslavement of China in China and the Far East. Letting them act under the orders of American capitalists is the so-called plan to aid the revitalization of Japan in the Marshall Plan. There are many threads between the Japanese Konzerns that expand their aggression in China and London and New York. In 1934-35, foreign capitalists' loans and investments in Japan totaled 239.7 million yen, most of which belonged to the American Morgan monopoly capital group and the British monopoly capital group. American capital has continuously encouraged and supported exclusive companies such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi. These companies are the organs of Japanese zaibatsu to carry out colonial aggression and plunder in the Far East and in Manchuria and North China. Morgan and other American bankers paid out 90 million loans for this business. Morgan Bank and Company sold national debt in Japan for the United States from 1924 to 1930. The American Electric General Trust, which belongs to Morgan's sphere of influence, almost monopolized the manufacture of light bulbs in Japan. Nakajima Aircraft Manufacturing Co. received loans from the United States in 1930. The Jiergen Lead Trust invested and operated a huge automobile factory with the Japanese. Almost all the parts used to assemble automobiles in this factory were shipped from the United States. American monopoly capitalists participated in the manufacture of Japanese kerosene. American companies started this construction work during the period when Japanese imperialists stepped up preparations for the war. In areas without electricity, they built huge power plants. These are joint ventures between the Mitsui Konzern and the American Mobil Oil Company.
    The purpose of this American monopoly capitalist's action to support Japan is to help Japanese imperialism implement its barbarous policy of aggression in the Far East and to help Japan invade China. According to a report in the Osaka News on the end of June 1934: Neimen, a banker and friend of Morgan, agreed with Japan's views in his conversation with the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and implemented military action against China.

### 莫斯科电台揭露：　美帝正扶持日本财阀图共同奴役中国人民

　　莫斯科电台揭露：
  　美帝正扶持日本财阀图共同奴役中国人民
    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科电台八日广播马西努评论，指出美国独占资本家正在扶持日本财阀重新侵略中国，奴役中国人民。全文如下：
    以下三个消息差不多是同时传出的：十一月二十七日，合众社记者引证官方人士的声明说：美国务院、陆军部和其他政府机关现时正在打算重新审查关于日本最大垄断机构（如三菱、三井公司）的问题。在第二天，就是十一月二十八日，纽约世界评论杂志登载了东京通讯，其中说：麦克阿瑟将军的经济顾问正在准备着对日本的马歇尔计划。经过五天后（就是十二月三日），伦敦广播电台引证美联社由上海传出的消息说：中国（蒋）政府赞同了和日本恢复贸易关系，并将于最近派遣一批经由政府允准的商人到日本去。差不多同时出现的这三种消息并不是偶然的，因为日本财阀问题、中日贸易关系问题及美国对日计划问题，是彼此密切联系着的。
    如果考察一下日本垄断组织的发展历史，局部的如三菱、三井发展的历史，就不难发现他们的发展有两个特点：第一个特点是：他们的财富的来源是对亚洲和远东各民族——首先是对中国人民实行经济和军事侵略及殖民地的掠夺；他们是日本帝国主义之后台老板，他们武装了日本的军队，并以财政支持日本侵略中国。日本财阀利用军事力量来夺取供给原料和销售商品的中国市场，把中国变成日本的殖民地。第二个特点：就是日本财阀如果没有美、英独占资本家的帮助，他们是不能壮大起来的。密勒氏评论周报在评论一九三四年六月三十日的一个消息说：摩尔根银行支持日本对中国的侵略行动。该杂志指出：摩尔根在财政上帮助日本对满洲的侵略。并着重指出：摩尔根银行企图挑起远东大战，帮助日本建设军事工业和掠夺朝鲜、满洲及华北。发财致富的美国独占资本家在那时企图和日本独占资本家瓜分中国，并使其侵略苏联。世界评论杂志在今年十一月二十八日所说：“对日本的马歇尔计划”，实际上不过是美国独占资本家旧政策在新基础上的继续。在以前，美国独占资本援助日本财阀的目的只是想以日本财阀的行动，使中国变成美日共同的殖民地。
    因此据合众社消息：美国务院、陆军部和其他政府机构现时在重新审查关于解散日本大垄断组合如“三菱、三井公司”问题。该通讯根据官方人士的消息，继续说：主要问题在于使三菱、三井组合及其他公司继续活动，同时不叫他们直接管制日本，把对日本的管制操在美国资本家手中。这种主张是非常显明的：三菱、三井及其他财政大王是美国对中国和远东实施殖民地掠夺和奴役中国的有经验的同伴，让他们在美国资本家命令下活动，就是马歇尔计划中所谓援助复兴日本的计划。在中国扩展其侵略的日本康采仑与伦敦及纽约之间是有着许多线索的。一九三四年至三五年在日本的外国资本家借款和投资共有二十三万九千七百万日元，其中绝大多数都是属于美国摩尔根独占资本集团与英国独占资本集团的，美国资本曾经不断的用力鼓励与支持三井、三菱等独占公司，这些公司是日本财阀向远东及向满洲和华北实行殖民地侵略掠夺的机关，摩尔根和其他美国银行家对这种事业支付出了九千万的贷款，击尔根银行和公司在一九二四至三○年为美国在日本发卖国债。摩尔根的势力范围所属美国电气总托拉斯，差不多垄断了全日本的电灯泡制造。中岛飞机制造厂在一九三○年从美国得到了贷款。击尔根列德托拉斯投资和日人经营了一个巨大的汽车制造厂，这个工厂用来装制汽车的零件差不多都是由美国运来的。美国独占资本家参加了日本煤油的制造厂。美国公司在日本帝国主义者加紧准备大战时期，展开了这种建筑工作，在毫无电力的区域，它们建筑了巨大的发电厂。这都是由三井康采仑与美国美孚公司联合的合组企业。
    美国独占资本家这一支持日本的行动，其目的即在帮助日本帝国主义向远东实施其野蛮的侵略政策，及帮助日本侵略中国。据一九三四年六月底大阪新闻报消息：摩尔根的好友银行家内门特在其和日本驻美大使的谈话中同意日本的观点，向中国实行军事行动。
