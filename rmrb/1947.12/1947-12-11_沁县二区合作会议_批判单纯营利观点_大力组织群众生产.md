    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 9th] The managers of cooperative societies in the Second District of Qin County, at the cooperative society managers' meeting on November 24th, criticized the past purely profit-driven viewpoint of the cooperative societies, and re-decided the guiding principles for this winter, focusing on organizing mass transportation, textile and other production. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the past cooperative societies only served capital, and the rich peasant economic line of purely profit-driven viewpoint was mainly manifested in the size of the business, such as one cooperative society in Yang'an having four branches; the Guxian Town Cooperative Society operating on × types of businesses, forming a large number of cooperative society personnel, large expenses, and serving only the cooperative society itself. This approach is contrary to this year's winter production organization of mass textile, transportation and livestock buying work, and must be corrected. The final decisions were: (1) to reduce businesses, reduce personnel, overcome the idea of ​​taking pride in quantity, and focus all efforts on organizing mass textile and transportation. For example, the Yang'an Cooperative Society must retain several businesses according to the needs of the masses, and those that can be operated by mutual aid teams should be completely handed over to the mutual aid teams; Houhe, Miaozhuang, etc., are willing to move the businesses in Guxian Town back to the villages, and focus their efforts on organizing the production of the masses in their own villages; (2) Du Jintang and other twenty-five cooperative society managers reported a total of 2.99 million yuan in shares, preparing to purchase local homespun cloth, export it and exchange it for livestock to sell to the masses; (3) In this winter's ten-jin cotton campaign, each cooperative society guarantees to be responsible for supplying cotton, selling homespun cloth, reforming tools, training women weavers, and decided to challenge each district.
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 9th] The Yuebei District Government, Bank, and United Cooperative, in April this year, organized thirty credit cooperatives in Qin Yuan, Qin County, Tunliu, Changzi and other counties, actively supporting mass production, organizing rural idle capital, and enlivening the rural economy. According to incomplete statistics, among the thirty credit cooperatives, only twenty-five credit cooperatives, the masses have gathered funds of 25.12 million yuan, and the funds supported by the bank are only 15.9 million yuan. These twenty-five cooperative societies, after the settlement in July, August and September, in addition to the masses enjoying the benefits, the funds increased by more than 19.63 million yuan. Because the cooperative society can take care of the interests of both labor and capital, the number of members has generally increased. The eleven credit cooperatives in Qinyuan alone have reached 3,554 members. Great achievements have been made in organizing rural idle capital, and at the same time, the difficulties of mass production have been solved, and the rural economy has been enlivened. For example, the Qinyuan Chengguan Credit Cooperative, when August this year was the lean season, the land for indigo needed topdressing, and there was no way to sell indigo cakes (selling the indigo as soon as it grew in the land), and one jin of indigo only sold for 350 yuan, which was a great loss for the masses. The credit cooperative immediately lent the masses 1.1 million yuan, bought 90 shi of black beans, and applied them to 300 mu of indigo land, yielding 20 jin more indigo per mu, which could be worth 4.6 million yuan. In addition to repaying the cooperative's 1.1 million yuan loan, the masses also increased their income by 3.7 million yuan. The Qinyuan Honglin Zhang Rubao mutual aid team borrowed 200,000 yuan from the credit cooperative and sent people to traffic livestock, earning 120,000 yuan in one trip, which immediately expanded the mutual aid team from 15 people to 75 people. The whole village also combined bank loans to buy six oxen, ten mules, seventy-two sheep, and eight shuttle looms. The Qinyuan Wang Tao Credit Cooperative once lent 240,000 yuan to conscripted laborers, and eleven livestock transported goods from Yangcheng back to Zhao, earning a total of 110,000 yuan, and after expenses, there was still 90,000 yuan left, which further improved the morale of the front-line laborers. The forms of development are: (1) A credit cooperative specializing in credit, mainly in large market towns, whose task is to stabilize prices in addition to helping farmers and handicraft workers; (2) Establishing a credit department within general cooperative societies, unifying shares, distributing capital for operation, and distributing dividends as a whole; (3) Credit cooperatives are established with economic zones as the center to raise funds. In order to take care of the convenience of the masses and borrowing, funds are allocated by village and handled through mutual aid teams and representative conferences; (4) District United Cooperative Credit Cooperatives, whose scope is larger than the third type; (5) Credit cooperatives that combine labor mutual assistance and capital, that is, to make labor mutual assistance move towards capital mutual assistance, which plays a greater role in the development and consolidation of mutual aid teams. In order to further develop the credit cooperatives, new development directions have been set: 1. To develop into a financial organization of the masses themselves, implement the combination of labor and capital, and pay more attention to organizing agricultural production; 2. The credit cooperative will assume the responsibility of organizing and leading production, and establish a credit cooperative in the organization of production; 3. In order to prevent the credit cooperative from being affected by price fluctuations, it will carry out production adjustment and profit; 4. The deposit and loan should proceed from the convenience of the people, with simple procedures, and let the masses calculate the accounts together, calculate the long-term accounts, and invest in production; 5. Establish democratic leadership and promote the enthusiasm of the members; 6. The objects of support of the credit cooperative should especially take care of the poor and hired peasants.

    沁县二区合作会议
    批判单纯营利观点
    大力组织群众生产
    【本报太岳九日电】沁县二区各合作社经理，在十一月廿四日的合作社经理会议上，批判了过去合作社的单纯营利观点，重新决定今冬方针，重点放在组织群众运输、纺织等生产上。在会议上，大家一致认为过去的合作社只是为资本服务，单纯营利观点的富农经济路线，主要表现在业务上的庞大，如杨安一个合作社就有四个分社；故县镇合作社经营的就有×种业务，形成了合作社人员多、开支大，单纯为合作社本身服务。这种做法和今年冬季生产组织群众纺织运输买牲口的工作相违背，必须加以纠正。最后决定：（一）紧缩业务，减少人员，克服以多为荣的想法，全力放在组织群众纺织运输上面。如杨安合作社，要根据群众需要留下几种业务，互助组能经营的，完全交给互助组；后河、庙庄等，都愿把在故县镇的业务搬回村内，力量放在组织本村群众生产上；（二）杜晋堂等二十五个合作社的经理，自报集股洋二百九十九万元，准备收买本地土布，输出后换回牲口卖给群众；（三）今冬十斤花运动中，各合作社保证负责供给棉花，推销土布，改造工具，培养织妇，并决定向各区提出挑战。
    【本报太岳九日电】岳北区政府、银行、联合社，今年四月间，在沁源、沁县、屯留、长子等县组织的三十个信用合作社，积极扶植群众生产，组织农村游资，活跃农村经济，据不完全统计，三十个信用合作社中，仅二十五个信贷社，群众即集有资金二千五百一十二万元，银行扶植的资金只有一千五百九十万元。这二十五个合作社，经七、八、九三个月的结算。除群众享到利益外，资金又增加了一千九百六十三万多元。由于合作社能照顾到劳资双方的利益，社员普遍的增加，单沁源的十一个信贷社，社员已达三千五百五十四人。在组织农村游资有很大成绩，同时也解决了群众生产的困难，活跃了农村经济。如沁源城关信用社，当今年八月正是青黄不接的时候，蓝地要上追肥，没有办法卖盘子（蓝在地长着就把靛卖了），一斤靛只卖三百五十元，群众吃亏很大，信用社即贷给群众一百一十万元，买了九十石黑豆上了三百亩蓝地，每亩多打了二十斤靛，能值四百六十万元，群众除还了合作社一百一十万元贷款外，还长三百七十万元。沁源洪林张茹保互助组，在信贷社贷了二十万元，抽出人来贩牲口，一次就赚了十二万元，使互助组马上由十五人发展到七十五人。全村又结合银行贷款，买进耕牛六头、骡十头、羊七十二只、拉梭机八架。沁源王陶信贷社，一次贷给支差民工二十四万元，十一个牲口由阳城回照运输，共赚了十一万元，除开支外，还长了九万元，更提高了支前民工的情绪。在发展的形式上有：（一）专营信用社，主要是在大集镇，任务是除帮助农民手工业者外，还平抑物价；（二）在一般合作社内建立信用部，统一入股，分资经营、整体分红；（三）是以经济区为中心，集资办理信贷社，为照顾群众与借款方便，按村划定资金，通过互助组及代表会办理；（四）区联社信用社，其范围比第三种更大；（五）劳动互助与资金相结合的信用社，就是使劳力互助走向资金互助，对互助组的发展巩固所起作用更大。为了更进一步的发展各信用社，又定出新的开展方向：一、要发展为群众自己的金融组织，实行劳力与资金结合，更多的注意组织农业生产；二、信用合作社将担负起组织领导生产的责任，在组织生产中建立信贷社；三、为使信用社在物价波动的情况下不受影响，将进行生产调剂利润；四、存放款要从便利于人民出发，手续简便，要让群众伙算帐，算长远帐，投入生产；五、建立民主的领导，发扬社员的积极性；六、信用社扶植的对象特别要照顾到贫雇农。
