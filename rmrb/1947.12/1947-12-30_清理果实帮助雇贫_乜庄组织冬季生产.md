　　Clearing Fruits to Help Hired Laborers and Poor Peasants
  　Miezhuang Organizes Winter Production
    [This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 28th] In the process of land reform and review, Miezhuang in Qingfeng County learned that this year's harvest was poor, and the grain harvested by poor peasants was not enough to eat. They requested to clear out fruits (of labor) as capital for winter production. Based on this urgent demand from the masses, the first step was to calculate the total accounts and distribute money and grain. A total of twenty shi of grain and 160,000 yuan have been cleared out, and the poor peasant groups are discussing how to distribute it. Initially, some proposed distributing it according to class status, some proposed that each neighborhood committee evaluate and distribute it, and some proposed distributing it according to the size of the "poor pit," filling the large pits more and the small pits less. In the end, everyone agreed on the method of filling the poor pits. The masses first reported the size of their poor pits and how much money they needed for business, and then the masses evaluated the reports. As a result, the pits of ninety-two households were filled. The poor peasants now have capital for production. In addition to the original seven transportation teams, seven cotton ginning teams, and one oil pressing team in the village, other teams are being organized.

  　乜庄组织冬季生产
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】清丰乜庄在翻身检查中，了解到今年歉收，贫农打的粮食不够吃，要求清理果实做本钱搞冬季生产。根据群众这一迫切要求，首先算总帐，分钱分粮。计已清出粮食二十石，款十六万元，由贫农小组酝酿怎样分。起初有的提议按等级分，有的提议由各街评议分配，有的提议按穷坑大的多填、坑小的少填办法分，最后大家都同意了填穷坑的办法。群众先自报，穷坑大小，需要多少钱作买卖，自报后经群众评议。结果共填了九十二户的坑，贫农有了生产本钱，全村除原有七个运输组、七个弹花组、一个打油组，其他正在组织进行中。
