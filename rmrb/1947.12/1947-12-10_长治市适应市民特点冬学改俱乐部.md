　　[This Dispatch from Changzhi] The Propaganda Department of the Changzhi Municipal Party Committee recently convened a Propaganda and Liaison Conference. In addition to reviewing the propaganda and education work of the past year, the main discussion focused on how to carry out mass education in the future. First, it was analyzed that the demands of citizens are diverse, so the organization cannot be generalized. At the same time, the seasonality of the entire city is not obvious, and it was decided to establish a citizen's club to replace the previous people's schools and winter studies. Education will be conducted in various forms. A director and deputy director will be appointed to lead, with two sections below: education and entertainment. The education section will conduct political and cultural education for the masses. Political education will mainly be carried out by district cadres, street political directors, and street chiefs in conjunction with the current central work; cultural education will be provided by cultural teachers to educate the masses to read, write, and do arithmetic. In addition, it will also organize and lead broadcasting stations, blackboards, and communication groups. The entertainment section will organize mass entertainment. Street drama troupes will be developed in streets with a foundation, and old and new artists will be organized to become a powerful weapon for promoting the central work. After the meeting, all districts are mobilizing and organizing. Comrade Li Yisheng of the Third District Committee convened relevant cadres and primary school teachers from each street to discuss. Other districts also discussed it at the sub-committee meeting. The enthusiasm of all streets is very high. The preparations are now underway. (Li Zhen)
　　[This Dispatch from Lin County] The Sangyuan School District in Lin County, with a total of eleven primary schools, convened a teachers' meeting on the 22nd of last month. Everyone felt that after the masses turned themselves over, their demand for culture was very urgent. It was unanimously decided that in the future, the focus of school education should be placed on the children of those who have turned themselves over, following the mass line, so that the masses recognize that it is their own school, and organize poor children who collect firewood and herd cattle, combine production and culture, and organize a large number of out-of-school youth literacy classes, etc. (Zhen Nan, Heng Ju)
