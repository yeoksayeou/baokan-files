　　How to Launch Winter Production by Engaging Poor Laborers?
　　Taihang Third District
　　Recently, the Ping Shun First District District Village Cadre Conference summarized a month of winter production and found that although the winter production movement had been initiated, it still lacked backbone and strength. The main reason for this was the failure to truly implement the line of engaging poor laborers, with some non-poor laborer muddled views and erroneous practices still prevalent among cadres. Here, we present several key issues for discussion.

　　I. Correcting Erroneous Views on Poor Laborers
　　It is impossible to follow the line of engaging poor laborers without correctly understanding them. This is a conceptual issue that must be clarified first in the minds of cadres:

　　The following erroneous views on poor laborers were discovered during the ideological examination of cadres in the First District and must be thoroughly corrected.

　　1. Failing to view poor laborers from a class perspective. Many cadres treat poor laborers as merely impoverished people, and therefore only pay attention to the few impoverished households lacking food, drink, and labor, while ignoring the entire poor laborer class. For example, in Wang Zhuang, only five poor laborer households were initially identified out of more than 170 households. Cadres in Chongyan were worried about not finding any poor laborers. Sang Sanhai, an old farmers' association member who had been a sheep worker his entire life, did not consider himself a poor laborer. He said, "Haven't we already turned ourselves around; are we still impoverished?" Some, due to unclear class distinctions, have the confused idea of "Can old middle peasants also be poor laborers?" This will fragment and divide the poor laborer class, weakening the class's strength.

　　2. Forcing a "shiny image" onto poor laborers. When calculating family assets and the "cultivating three and saving one" metric, cadres often make the serious mistake of ignoring the actual difficulties of poor laborers and forcing a "shiny image" onto them. For example, when calculating the assets of Zhang Jingze (a poor laborer) in Beitou Village, when he said he was short half a year's worth of food and drink, the cadre said: "You got 'five big advantages' from fruit distribution, so now it's not enough?" Thus, they forcibly calculated his income based on the average output of the past three years, without deducting burdens, labor exchange rice, and miscellaneous expenses, resulting in a "cultivating three and saving one" calculation. Village Chief Huang Linzhu confessed, "I thought, since we turned ourselves around, how can we still say we have difficulties? When my father said, 'it's not good enough,' I scolded him for being stubborn and embarrassing, and I was also afraid of landlords and rich peasants making fun of us."

　　3. Because the poor laborers' turnaround is incomplete and superficial, they are often criticized and blamed by cadres in their work. Guo Xihai (over 60 years old) of Chuandi only received a few acres of land during land reform. During weeding, because he often went out to eat and drink, he became the target of criticism at village meetings, both large and small. During the autumn harvest summary, it was even said, "Old Xihai is one corn stalk, four broad beans, and doesn't pay attention to technique." Xihai's reply was, "I'm picking up the scraps of the autumn harvest; if I don't pick up the pods, I won't get anything."

　　4. In their work, some have even resorted to exploiting poor laborers. In Lujiakou, when collecting labor exchange rice, to encourage poor laborers to take the lead, they were made to pay grain even if they didn't have rice. As a result, poor laborers reflected, "After paying the grain, we can't even eat bran." Every time a case is sent from Chengguan, it is the poor laborer militia (deemed reliable) who travel back and forth to Changzhi for four days during the autumn harvest, earning only 14 work points (one point per ten li). Hiring someone to work at home would cost 30 to 40 points, which is a big loss, so they feel they "can't afford to take the lead."

　　All of this is extremely wrong.

　　II. Care and Mobilization
　　Simply providing care versus focusing on ideological mobilization combined with resolving specific difficulties is two different approaches to implementing the line of engaging poor laborers. The former is one-sided, while the latter is complete and proper.

　　According to the First District Cadre Conference, in this phase of the movement, some villages are still stuck in simply caring for poor laborers, forming a pattern of bestowing charity and preferential treatment while neglecting full ideological mobilization. For example, in Shannandi, to ensure loans were given to poor laborers (as emphasized by the leadership), Lao Shunze, the poorest in the village, was allocated 5,000 yuan. He refused three times, and the cadres put the 5,000 yuan into a small-scale cooperative. The Wang Zhuang Shuicheng team earned over 5,000 yuan from selling peanuts, and all of it was given to the team's two poor laborer households, 4,000 yuan to one and 1,000 yuan to the other. He also said, "I'm also impoverished, why only 1,000 yuan?" Some mutual aid regulations specifically allocate 10% of the profits to caring for poor laborers. Such charity results in two kinds of responses from poor laborers: one is gratitude to the cadres, and the other is waiting for care.

　　In contrast, mobilizing poor laborers ideologically and combining it with solving practical difficulties in their production enables poor laborers to actively participate and become the backbone of the movement. Chuandi, in this regard, although they initially took a detour, quickly corrected themselves. In addition to using the "three calculations" method to fully mobilize, the village also conducted individual mobilization of poor laborers. The poor laborer Lao Han Guo Xihai, with a family of three, had only two shi of corn and lacked confidence in production. Cadres helped him calculate: "You know how to weave. If you weave 20 baskets this winter, you can earn a shi of rice. If you join the small-scale cooperative, you can also earn interest. Your wife and daughter can spin cotton, and that can also earn a shi of grain." After inspiring his enthusiasm for production, they also sold him the thorns on the forbidden slope at a low price. The old man became energized. The cooperative found a market for vermicelli in Chengguan and let him sell it first, earning 1,400 yuan in half a day. From then on, his confidence grew even more. Currently, he has gone from passive to active. The village's experience in mobilizing poor laborers: (1) Use the "three calculations" to inspire conscious winter production. (2) For those with labor, solve the problem of lacking capital. (3) For those with fewer skills and weaker labor, help them find production opportunities and reliable businesses (such as mills). (4) For those who cannot calculate accounts or recognize receipts, use the method of organizing them to go out. (5) Loans are implemented with the principle of "whole loan, zero repayment," which is very convenient. In this way, all the poor laborers in the village are fully mobilized. Chang Shuangxi and others transported rice to Rencun in Linxian without rest, making four trips in a row. Five disabled old men organized shops, flour mills, and weaving. Within nine days, the entire village earned more than 500,000 yuan. From the perspective of results, this approach is clearly good and should be greatly promoted.

　　III. Mobilizing Poor Laborers to Unite with Middle Peasants
　　Fearing that it would affect the mood of middle peasants and being afraid to boldly follow the line of engaging poor laborers is a widespread and serious problem in the minds of district and village cadres. For example, in Shannandi, because cadres held this muddled idea, they did not even dare to mention the words "poor laborer," but called them "tired households." (Editor's note: It should be clearly recognized that this is not just muddled, but a deliberate insult to poor laborers!)

　　It must be clearly recognized that only by fully mobilizing poor laborers can we lead and unite middle peasants. Guo Youke (a middle peasant) of Chuandi initially did not want to participate in transportation, but after the poor laborers were greatly mobilized and obtained great benefits, he actively requested to participate. Because although middle peasants are also threatened by disasters, due to many concerns, their demands for making up for losses are far less urgent than those of poor laborers. Therefore, whether the current winter production movement can be carried out well depends on whether the poor laborers have been mobilized, not on the mood of the middle peasants.

　　Another thing that must be affirmed and believed is that supporting poor laborer production, making up for losses, and getting rich is completely consistent with the interests of middle peasants. Therefore, mobilizing poor laborers should not be avoided or doubted by middle peasants. After comparing family assets, comparing difficulties, and middle and poor peasants talking to each other, middle peasants can completely sympathize with poor laborers and achieve the great unity of middle and poor peasants. In terms of mobilization methods, poor laborers can be mobilized separately or together with middle and poor peasants, but the problem lies in whether the leadership's thinking is clear. (Editor's note: This article not only exposes the seriousness of the situation where poor laborers are being looked down upon, but also exposes the view of the compilers of this article, who see the mobilization of poor laborers only as a matter of method. The reasons for this situation can be discussed further.)

　　怎样发动雇贫冬季生产？
    太行三专
    最近平顺从一区区村干会议总结一个月冬产中，发现冬产运动，虽说轰开了，但仍表现运动无骨干、无力，主要原因即在于没有真正贯彻雇贫路线，在干部中还相当普遍的存在着一些非雇贫的糊涂观点与错误做法。这里提出几个主要问题来研究。
    一、扭转对雇贫的错误看法
    不能正确认识雇贫，也就不可能走雇贫路线，这是在干部思想上必须首先明确的一个观点问题：
    一区干部的思想检查中，发现以下几个对雇贫的错误看法，必须彻底扭转过来。
    １、不从阶级上去看雇贫，好些干部把雇贫当作贫苦，因而一般只注意了没吃喝和孤寡无劳力的少数贫苦户，而不到整个雇贫阶层。如王庄一百七十余户，开始只找到五户雇贫。崇岩干部都发愁找不到雇贫，老农会桑三孩当了一辈羊工，也不把自己当雇贫，他说：“咱翻了身还是贫苦？”有的因阶级划分不清，而产生“老中农是否也有雇贫？”的糊涂想法，这样就会把雇贫层支离割裂，减弱阶级力量。
    ２、不能给雇贫硬“装光”。在算家当算耕三余一时，干部常有不顾雇贫实际困难，硬给雇贫装光的严重错误。如北头村给张竟则（雇贫）算家当，人家说短半年吃喝，干部说：你分果实是：“五大合适”，现在又不够了？于是硬按三年平均产量，不扣除负担、变工米、杂支算了个耕三余一。村长黄林柱检讨，我想咱翻了身，还能再说困难，父亲一说：“不够好”就骂他老顽固嫌丢人，也怕人家地主、富农讽刺。
    ３、由于雇贫翻身不透，底空，在工作中常被干部批评、责备。川底郭喜孩（六十多岁）土改中才分到几亩地，锄苗时因常到外边扑闹吃喝，而变成本村大会小会的批评对象。秋收总结时还被提出：“老喜孩是一稞玉茭、四稞眉豆、不讲技术”。喜孩的回答是：“我是小收秋哩，不带荚子就接不到秋”。
    ４、在工作中，有的竟形成利用雇贫，路家口收变工米，为使雇贫带头，没有米就让交谷，结果雇贫反映：“交了米连把糠也吃不上”。城关每逢送案，就是雇贫民兵（图可靠）秋收时往长治往返四天，只顶了十四分勤工（十里一分），家里用工就需三、四十分，吃亏很大，感到“带不起头”。
    凡此种种，都是非常错误的。
    二、照顾和发动
    单纯照顾和着重思想发动，结合解决其具体困难，是执行雇贫路线中两种不同做法。前者是片面的，而后者则是完整的与正当的。
    根据一区干部会议检查，在这一段运动中，部分村庄仍停留于对雇贫的单纯照顾，形成恩赐救济优待，而忽略从思想上的充分发动。如山南底为了把贷款贷到雇贫手里（领导上强调），给全村最雇贫的老顺则分配了五千元，连送三次都被拒绝，结果干部又把五千元给他入到小型社。王庄水成组贩花生赚五千余元，全部照顾了本组两户雇贫，一个四千元，一个一千元，他还说我也是贫苦怎么只分一千元？有些互助规定的分红办法，专门划出百分之十照顾雇贫。这样恩赐的结果，对雇贫本身会产生两种反映：一种是对干部感恩，一种是等待照顾。
    与此相反的则是从思想上发动雇贫、并结合解决其生产中的实际困难，使雇贫积极行动起来，成为运动骨干，川底在这方面，虽曾走过一段弯路，但很快即转过来。该村除用三算办法全面发动外，并对雇贫进行个别发动，雇贫老汉郭喜孩三口人，只有两石玉茭，生产没信心。干部帮他算帐：“你会编造，一冬天编上二十付箩头，就赚石把米，入到小型社，还能赚利，老婆小女纺花，也能赚石把粮食”。启发其生产情绪后，又把禁坡的荆条，低价卖给一部，老汉起了劲。合作社在城关找到小粉销路，又先让他去卖，半天赚到一千四百元，从此信心更大，目前他已由被动变为积极。该村发动雇贫的经验：（一）用三算启发冬产自觉。（二）对有劳力的解决没本困难。（三）对办法少、劳力弱的帮他找生产门路，并找保险买卖（如磨坊等）。（四）对算不了帐，认不得票的，则用组织起来往外带的办法。（五）贷款实行整贷零还、很方便。这样全村雇贫完全行动起来，常双喜等往林县任村运米不休息，一连跑四趟，五个残废老汉，组织开店、磨面、编造。九天内全村赚钱五十余万元，从效果上看，很显然这种做法是好的，应大大发扬。
    三、发动雇贫团结中农
    害怕影响中农情绪，而不敢大胆走雇贫路线，是区村干部思想较为普遍严重的问题。如山南底干部因存在这种糊涂想法，连“雇贫”两字也不敢提，而叫“疲累户”。（编者按：应明确认识：这不只是糊涂，而是对雇贫有意的侮蔑！）
    必须明确认识，只有充分发动了雇贫，才能带起中农、团结中农。川底郭有科（中农）开始不愿参加运输，及至雇贫大动起来获得大利之后，他又积极要求参加。因为中农虽也受到灾荒威胁，但由于顾虑多，其补歉要求，远不如雇贫迫切。因而目前冬产运动能否搞好，是雇贫已否发动起来的问题，而不是中农情绪问题。
    再一个还须肯定相信，扶植雇贫生产、补歉、发家是和中农利益完全一致的，因之发动雇贫丝毫不应对中农回避怀疑。经过比家当、比困难、中贫农谈心，中农完全可以同情雇贫，达到中贫农大团结，在发动方式上，雇贫单独发动或中贫农一起发动都可以，问题就在领导思想是否明确。（编者按：这篇文章不但暴露了雇贫被轻视情形的严重，而且暴露了把发动雇贫只看作是方法问题，即本文整理者的观点也是如此。为什么造成此种情形，可以展开讨论。）
