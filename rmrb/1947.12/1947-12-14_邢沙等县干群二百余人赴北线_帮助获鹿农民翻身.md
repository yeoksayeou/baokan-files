    More Than 200 Cadres and Masses from Xingtai, Shahe and Other Counties Go to the Northern Front to Help Huolu Peasants Overturn
    [Our newspaper, Huolu News] After the liberation of Shizhuang, the poor masses throughout the county, driven by hunger, urgently demanded to overturn. In order to support the masses in the newly liberated northern front to overturn, more than 200 peasants and village cadres from Xingtai, Shahe, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Zanhuang and other five counties on our southern front, under the slogan of "Peasants all over the world are one family, we must help our class brothers to overturn," rushed to the northern front, demonstrating a high degree of class enthusiasm. Comrade Shen Lin from Neiqiu was sick in the legs, but did not fall behind on the road. Comrade Shi Zhenliang voluntarily signed up for the army in the village, but was unqualified due to illness. He said, "I can't go south to catch old Chiang, but I want to go north to help my class brothers overturn." Old man Sun Wu Cheng is forty-nine years old, and his spirit is as high as a young man. He said, "I have suffered all my life. The Communist Party came and I turned over. Now I want to help the Huolu masses turn over. I am very happy in my heart and feel much younger." After they arrived in Huolu, they and more than 300 cadres from the county gathered to study the mass movement work in the new district, learning from each other and exchanging experiences, and decided to go down to the villages following the poor peasant and farm laborer line, listen to the poor peasants and farm laborers, do things for them, and help them to completely turn over. After the meeting, on December 3rd, the entire group went to the countryside, broke through the base points, and promoted the entire county. The poor people in Yongbi Town sent a letter to the county magistrate, asking them to send someone to lead them to struggle quickly. Jia Guichen's mother, a militiaman from Nangu Yi, said happily: "Poor people from the south come to help poor people from the north to turn over. Poor people all over the world are one family." The poor masses throughout the county expressed a warm welcome to the support of the masses who have turned over from the southern front. The movement is about to begin. (Xuting)
