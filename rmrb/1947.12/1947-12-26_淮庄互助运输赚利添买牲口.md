　　Huaizhuang Mutual Aid Transportation Earns Profits to Buy Livestock
    [Report from this newspaper in Shahe] Huaisi Yi, the director of the farmers' association in Huaizhuang Village, Sixth District, called on everyone to pool shares for sideline production when launching the winter production campaign. However, no one did it, and everyone responded: "There is nothing to do." Huaisi Yi thought: If this continues, the village's winter production cannot be carried out. So, he decided to do it himself. He thought: Whether I make money or not, I can at least feed myself. He sold a bag of soybeans and a bag of sorghum as capital, bought two bags of millet, ground them into rice, and sold them in Xingtai City, earning four thousand yuan. He immediately went to mobilize the masses to pool shares again, but still no one believed him. He said: "If you don't believe me, I'll do it again, and you can see when I make money." The second time, he bought two more bags of millet and earned three thousand yuan this time. The Party branch secretary's mutual aid group saw that he had made a profit, and five people pooled 70,000 yuan in shares, bought eight bags of millet, and including transportation and grinding, they used seventeen workers in total and earned 45,000 yuan in total. They immediately distributed dividends, using the method of 30% for capital and 70% for labor. Labor shares were calculated by work points, without wages. After this distribution, they immediately pooled 240,000 yuan in shares again. From buying millet to selling rice, it took twenty-eight workers and earned 87,000 yuan. After this accounting and dividend distribution, it was very different from before. Twenty people came to request to pool shares, and suddenly 400,500 yuan was invested. Wang Jinglin's group of eighteen households also pooled 350,000 yuan and insisted on working with Huaisi Yi's group, and they agreed. With the expansion of the shares, just milling rice was not enough. The village's three stone mills could only grind eight bags of millet a day at most, and the capital could not be turned over. Huaisi Yi discussed with everyone: How can we find new production avenues? The result of the discussion was to engage in transportation and to establish a coal factory. First, they used 220,000 yuan to buy two mules, and they would sell them to whoever wanted them, but no one could afford them at the time, so they transported them within the group. Twenty-five of their thirty-eight households were hired poor peasants, and many households did not have livestock, making transportation difficult. So, they came up with a new method: For example, if Liu Ersuo wanted to buy a donkey, he could only come up with 50,000 yuan, and the group added 20,000 yuan to help him buy a donkey. The donkey was still used for transportation within the group, counting as 70,000 yuan in shares for dividends, with 20,000 yuan of the profits going to the group and 50,000 yuan going to the individual. When he earned enough money to repay the 20,000 yuan to the group, the donkey would belong entirely to Liu Ersuo. Similarly, they helped Niu Jihe buy half a cow. Now, in addition to buying millet and grinding rice, they also transport soybeans from the east to the west and rice from the south to the north, and they are also preparing to open a coal factory and continue to help hired poor peasants buy livestock.

　　淮庄互助运输赚利添买牲口
    【本报沙河讯】六区淮庄村，农会主任淮思义，在发动冬季生产运动时，号召大家集股搞副业，但是没人干，大家反映：“没啥可干。”淮思义想：要象这样，村上的冬季生产可搞不开，于是就自己下决心干，他想：赚钱不赚钱，怎样也能顾住个嘴。他卖了一布袋黄豆、一布袋高粱作本钱，买了两布袋谷子，回来碾成米，到邢台市卖了，赚下四千元。他马上就又去动员群众集股干，但是仍然没人相信，他说：“你们不信我再干一趟，赚了钱叫你们看看。”第二次，他又去买了两口袋谷子，这次赚了三千元。党长的互助组看见他得了利，有五个人就集起来七万块钱股金，买回来八口袋谷子，连运输，带碾卖，共用工十七个，共赚了四万五千元，马上就分红，办法是资三劳七，劳力股是按工计算，不赚工资。这样分了以后，他们当下就又集了二十四万元的股金，从买谷到卖米，用了二十八个工，赚钱八万七千元。这次结帐分红后，和从前可大不相同了，二十个人都来要求集股，一下子就入了四十万零五千元。王景林组十八户，也集了三十五万元，一定要求和淮思义组伙干，他们就答应了。股金扩大了，光搞碾米不行，全村三盘碾子，一天顶多才碾八口袋谷，资本不能周转，淮思义就和大家商量：怎样再找生产门路？讨论结果是搞运输，并再设立一个煤厂。先用二十二万元买了两个骡子，谁要就卖给谁，当时都要不起，就在组里运输。他们三十八户内有二十五户是雇贫农，不少户没有牲口，运输还很困难，他们就又研究出了新的办法：如刘二锁想买一个驴，他只能拿五万元，组里又给他添了两万元，买下一个驴，这驴就仍在组内运输，顶七万股金分红，两万红利归组内，五万红利归个人，等他赚下钱，还了组内的两万元，驴就全归了刘二锁。又象这样，帮助牛吉合买了半个牛。现在，除了买谷碾米外，还从东边往西运黄豆，从南往北运米，并且还在筹备开煤厂，还要继续帮助雇贫购买牲口。　（高孟、奎林、政民）
