　　Xu Zhou Poor People Secretly Spread Good News
　　The People's Liberation Army Has Demolished the Railways Around the City; Everyone Will Soon Be Able to Distribute Grain!
　　[Our newspaper's dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu region on the 27th] The citizens of Xuzhou are secretly spreading good news, causing great unease among the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The Chiang bandits in Xuzhou, amidst the large-scale counter-offensive by our People's Liberation Army, are displaying extreme panic. Bunkers and fortifications are scattered throughout the streets and in front of shops. The bandits are busy day and night checking household registrations and capturing citizens. All two hundred trucks in the city are equipped with machine guns, patrolling the streets day and night. The bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek secretly flew to Xuzhou on the 10th to deploy city defenses. Artillery positions and air-raid shelters have been added to the mountains surrounding the city. The citizens in the city are always secretly spreading the word: "The People's Liberation Army has demolished all the railways around the city. There aren't many soldiers in the city. This time, the Chiang bandits are finished." When the poor people in the city meet, they always smile secretly: "We won't go hungry when the Eighth Route Army comes. The grain in that big warehouse will be distributed to the poor." When the poor citizens mention the Eighth Route Army, they always talk about how to distribute property and grain, eagerly waiting for the People's Liberation Army to open up Xuzhou as soon as possible.

　　徐州穷人暗传喜讯
  　解放军扒了四外铁路
    大家不久就能分粮啦
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日电】徐州市民暗暗传喜讯，蒋家匪帮甚表不安。在我人民解放军大举反攻中的徐州蒋匪，呈现极度惶恐状态。市内各街口及铺门前碉堡及工事，星罗棋布，匪徒们日夜忙于检查户口及捕捉市民，市内所有两百辆卡车均设机枪，昼夜沿街巡逻，匪首蒋介石于十日秘密飞徐州布署城防，城周围各山均添设炮兵阵地及防空洞，城内市民总是偷偷的传着：“四外的铁路都叫解放军扒了，城内又没有多少兵，这回蒋匪可要完啦。”市内的穷苦人们见了总是暗笑一阵：“八路军来就不挨饿了，那大仓库的粮食要分给穷人啦。”穷苦的市民们一提到八路军，总是要谈论怎样分财分粮的事。日夜在盼望解放军早日将徐州打开。
