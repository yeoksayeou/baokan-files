　　North and South Tianhe Check Ideological Obstacles
    Clear Wages, Rectify Mutual Aid, and Winter Production Can Truly Start
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] After the base-point village cadres meeting in the second district of North and South Tianhe on November 18, after discussing and arranging the winter production work, the enthusiasm was still not great, and the meeting could not be promoted. After slowly checking and understanding, the following ideological obstacles were found: First, the accounts of the mutual aid group in the autumn harvest and autumn plowing were not cleared, or the wages and rice could not be obtained after the accounts were calculated, and the masses were not enthusiastic. Wang Shuanggui said: "Every day is either doing this or doing that, and I don't know what to do? The mutual aid group doesn't even calculate the accounts!" Wang Hai said: "Can I eat or drink these work points? What do I want them for?" Wang Gengcai said: "I can't be the leader of this group. We can't get together at the meeting. As soon as we meet, we quarrel. We don't have time to chase the accounts. The livestock are not fed, they are thin, and what else can we do for winter production!" Second, the idea of ​​seeing the big and not the small. North and South Tianhe went to the ×× department to order 50,000 catties of wheat, and each 100 catties had to pay 73 catties of flour. The Cao Linshui Brigade took 10,000 catties of wheat to the mutual aid group, and everyone shook their heads and said: "Can this production still be done? It's a loss!" North Tianhe distributed the wheat to the mutual aid groups, and they were all unhappy and said: "What are we doing with this? If Sanxi (Production Director) asks us to do it, let's do it for him!" Third, complacency. Li Haojing and Yang Jinfa in North Tianhe said: "We don't need to accumulate fertilizer for winter production. Our group has fertilizer, oil cakes, and sheep manure, so we don't need to accumulate fertilizer." Many other mutual aid groups also generally reflected this. There are also excuses that it is too cold to accumulate fertilizer. Fourth, dare not boldly order plans for spinning and weaving. The women in South Tianhe reflected: "We just spend the whole winter sewing clothes, making shoes, grinding, eating and drinking, and then it's over. What plans are there for spinning and weaving!" Women with young children said: "The children can't leave their hands, so how can we have time to spin and weave." Women who do not have children reflected: "Order less plans, but don't order them and fail to complete them, which would be embarrassing!" The women in North Tianhe also said: "The teacher is gone, no one will teach us, so how can we spin and weave?!" Because of these ideological problems, winter production was not promoted. South Tianhe ordered a five-day fertilizer accumulation plan a few days ago, but it failed. The solution to these ideological problems is: first let each group concentrate its efforts to calculate accounts, clear wages, and rectify mutual aid; in the rectification of mutual aid groups, check the "cultivate three, surplus one," clear minds, and raise enthusiasm for winter production. The Cao Linshui Brigade in South Tianhe and the Feng Genzhe Brigade in North Tianhe have carried out inspections, so that everyone realizes that winter production must be well organized in order to make up for the holes. The method of calculating accounts was also used to break through the complacency and the idea of ​​seeing the big and not the small. For example, Li Haojing in North Tianhe thought that there was no need to accumulate fertilizer. After inspection, it was found that five households had no fertilizer at all, and thirteen households lacked fertilizer for 130 mu of land. This alarmed the whole group, and a plan was made to complete the accumulation of ten caves of fertilizer. The Cao Linshui Brigade calculated the account of grinding flour, and found that pulling a cart of 500 catties of wheat can produce 75 catties of bran, which is enough for the labor cost. Grinding 10,000 catties of wheat can earn 90,000 yuan. After this calculation, everyone understood, and a plan was made: four people and four animals, four grinding discs were in charge of grinding flour, and four animals were pulling wheat. After the account was calculated, North Tianhe was also relying on wheat grinding flour. The women's spinning and weaving was to break through the idea that there are still many women who cannot wear cotton clothes. Zhang Cuize Group first made a plan to complete 80 catties of thread and 80 feet of cloth. Each group also began to make plans, and the whole village will complete 360 feet of cloth. The accumulation and transportation of fertilizer in the two villages has also started. In five days, North and South Tianhe had 87 laborers, piled 67 and a half caves, which could be used for more than 274 mu of land, and there were 51 people and 26 animals transporting outside.

　　南北天河检查思想障碍
    清理工资整顿互助冬季生产才真干开
    【本报长治讯】二区南北天河经过十一月十八日基点村干部会议，讨论布置了冬季生产工作后，劲头还是不大，开会下去推动不开。经慢慢的检查了解，发现有以下思想障碍：一、互助组秋收秋耕中的帐目没算清，或者算了帐得不上工资米，群众情绪不高。王双桂说：“每天不是干这就是干那，也不知干啥？互助组连个帐也不算！”王孩说：“我弄这些分票能吃还是能喝？我要这干啥？”王更才说：“咱当不了这个组长，开会也开不到一块，一开会就吵架，追算帐也没工夫，牲口没人喂，饿瘦啦，还弄啥冬季生产哩！”二、看大不看小的思想。南北天河去××部定了五万斤麦，每一百斤交七十三斤面，曹林水大队把一万斤麦子拿到互助组，谁见了也是摇摇头说：“这个生产还能干？赔钱哩！”北天河把麦子分配到各互助组，都不高兴的说：“弄这个干啥哩？三喜（生产主任）叫咱干就给人家干吧！”三、自满思想。北天河李好景、杨金发说：“搞冬季生产积肥哩，俺不，我这组都有肥，有油饼和羊粪，用不着积肥。”其他还有不少互助组也普遍这样反映。还有借口大冻啦，不能去积肥。四、纺织上不敢大胆订计划。南天河妇女们反映：“一冬天只顾缝衣服、做鞋、推碾、吃吃喝喝就过完啦，还订啥计划纺花织布哩！”累小孩妇女说：“孩子离不开手，有啥时间纺织哩。”没有孩子累手的妇女反映：“少订些计划，可不要订了完不成丢脸哩！”北天河妇女借口参军走了一个纺织老师，也都说：“老师走了，没人教，还能纺织哩？！”由于存着这几种思想问题，影响冬季生产推动不开，南天河前几天订了五天积肥计划，结果落了空。解决这些思想问题的办法是：先让各组集中火力算帐，清理工资，整顿互助；在整顿互助组中检查耕三余一，清醒头脑，提起冬季生产积极性。南天河曹林水大队，北天河冯根则大队，都进行了检查，使大家都认识到要好好组织冬季生产，才能补够窟窿。又用算帐办法打通了自满思想与看大不看小的思想，如北天河李好景认为用不着积肥，一经检查发现有五户完全没有肥，十三户就有一百三十亩地缺少肥料。这样惊醒了全组，订出要完成十个洞的积肥计划。曹林水大队把磨面算了一下帐，拉一车五百斤麦，能出七十五斤麸，够脚价，磨一万斤麦子可净赚九万元。这样一算都通了，订出计划：四个人四头牲口四盘磨管磨面，四头牲口拉麦子。北天河算过帐后也都在靠麦子磨面了。妇女的纺织是用现在还有好多妇女穿不上棉衣来打通了思想，张翠则组先订出完成八十斤线，八十丈布的计划，各组也开始订计划，全村要完成三百六十丈布。两村的积肥运输也动开了，五天中，南北天河有八十七个劳力，垒洞六十七个半，能上地二百七十四亩多，还有五十一个人，二十六头牲口出外运输。（生秀、亮鉴、令意、南天河通讯组）
