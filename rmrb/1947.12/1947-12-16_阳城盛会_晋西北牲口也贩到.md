[Report from our Taiyue Office on the 14th] To boost winter production and facilitate the exchange of goods, Yangcheng County held a fair starting on November 24th, lasting seven days and ending on the 30th. During the fair, business thrived throughout the city, with crowds thronging and all kinds of goods available. To address the difficulties faced by attendees, the trading company released large quantities of salt and cotton for sale, and widely advertised for the acquisition of homespun cloth and yellow silk. The county bank also provided 13.61 million yuan in loans to poor vendors, with an additional 7 million yuan in commercial loans. The Xingye Bank also issued 4.5 million yuan in loans. According to surveys conducted on the 27th and 28th, in addition to the usual 205 established merchants, there were 671 various vendors at the fair. Approximately 800 head of livestock were brought to the fair, with 101 head sold (including 15 mules, 6 horses, 50 donkeys, and 30 cattle). The South Gate Livestock Cooperative also sold most of the 40+ head of livestock they had recently purchased from northwestern Shanxi at the fair. Agricultural implements also sold quickly, including 576 carrying poles, 1,920 manure forks, as well as many other hoe handles, plow parts, animal halters, looms, and spinning wheels. Salt sales at the fair were slow, while 7,500 jin of cotton and over 520 bolts of homespun cloth were sold. There was also a significant exchange of various grains. Various businesses also saw increased activity compared to before the fair. For example, according to a survey of businesses on Yangcheng's Shizi Street, the Tongye Mutual Aid Society's average daily income before the fair was 72,000 yuan, while during the fair it was over 232,000 yuan. The Jixing Mutual Aid Society's average daily income before the fair was over 27,000 yuan, while during the fair it was 114,000 yuan per day.
