　　Changzhi Trains New Teachers
　　Over Two Thousand Children of Hired and Poor Peasants Now Enrolled
　　[Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] Changzhi County, in order to meet the cultural demands of peasants who have stood up, has decided to train a group of teachers from liberated peasants to genuinely serve the educational cause of the liberated peasants. Recently, a group of peasants with some literacy skills have been drawn from various villages to study in the county's simplified normal school. A total of one hundred and ten people officially started classes on December 11. The selection was based on village recommendations, review by responsible comrades at each base point, and then sent to the county by the district. The criteria were that they should be from the middle peasant class or lower, and not be targets of struggle. According to the statistics of the students at the school, there are 31 poor peasants, 2 extremely poor peasants, 20 lower-middle peasants, and 57 middle peasants. Many of them are cadres in the villages. The focus of their studies is to improve their literacy and strengthen class education. After experimentation, they were divided into two classes based on their literacy level. Everyone is in high spirits, and many people said that in the past, the landlords ran the schools, and we were not allowed to live in the schools. Now we can live in the schools too, and we must study hard.
　　[Another report] Changzhi County, since deciding on an educational policy that is oriented towards and serves hired and poor peasants, has, after more than a month of effort, according to statistics from eight school districts, a total of 3,634 school-age children of hired and poor peasants, of which 2,419 have already enrolled. On the 13th, a joint principals' meeting was convened to discuss and study how to continue implementing this policy, and the following was decided: 1. Start by inspiring the hired and poor peasants' desire for cultural liberation. Each village should have the hired and poor peasants recall the pain and losses they suffered in the past due to illiteracy, inspire their cultural demands, and actively send their children to school. 2. Solve the difficulties for children of hired and poor peasants to attend school. Because children of hired and poor peasants have not attended school in the past, and some have not fully turned over, they face difficulties in terms of books and stationery. Some are unable to leave their families to produce due to labor shortages. It is necessary to organize a large number of night schools and after-school study groups to organize the children of hired and poor peasants into learning as much as possible. 3. For the children of hired and poor peasants, especially those who are older, enlighten them by recalling that they could not go to school in the past and were bullied by landlord's children at school, so as to inspire their awareness and make them active in learning. Teachers should also change their views on poor children and strive to achieve good results, and examine their achievements based on the learning of children from hired and poor peasant backgrounds. 4. Inspire the hired and poor peasants to value education, establish school affairs committees dominated by hired and poor peasants, and launch a truly mass-based school-running movement.

　　长治培养新教员
  　雇贫儿童已有两千余入学
    【本报长治讯】长治县适应农民在文化上的翻身要求，决定培养一批翻身教员，真正为翻身农民的教育事业服务。近从各村抽调一批粗通文字的农民，到县里的简师班学习。共一百一十人，已于十二月十一日正式开学上课。在抽调上是由村里介绍，由各基点负责同志审查再由区保送至县。条件是中农以下成份，不要斗争对象。据到校学员成份统计，有贫农三十一人，赤贫二人，下中农二十人，中农五十七人。有许多在村上都是干部，在学习上以提高文化为主，加强阶级教育。经试验后按文化程度高低分做两班上课，大家学习情绪很好，有好多人说过去是人家地主办学校，咱们就不能住学校，现在咱也能住学校了，一定要好好学习。
    【又讯】长治县自决定教育方针面向雇贫，为雇贫服务，经月余的努力，现据八个学区统计，雇贫学龄儿童共三千六百三十四人，入学的已经有二千四百一十九人。十三日召集联合校长会议，讨论研究继续贯彻这个方针，并决定出：一、首先从启发雇贫农民的文化翻身要求入手，各村让雇贫回忆过去不识字所受的痛苦吃过的亏，启发起他们文化要求，积极的送子弟入学。二、解决雇贫子弟入学困难，因为雇贫农子弟过去没有入过学，还有的未翻透身，在书籍、文具上都感到困难，有的因家庭劳力困难在生产上离不开，要大量组织夜读生、校外学习小组等，尽量把雇贫子弟组织到学习中来。三、面向雇贫儿童，对较大一些的从启发他们过去不能上学校，在校受地主儿童欺负等，启发他的觉悟，使他在学习上积极起来。教员也要转变对贫苦儿童的看法，要教出成绩来，从雇贫儿童的学习上来检查成绩。四、启发雇贫农对教育重视，成立以雇贫为主的校务委员会，开展真正群众性的办学运动。
