    Taihang Administrative Office Organizes Masses for
    Voluntary Transport and Convenient Hauling, Achieving Two Goals at Once

    [Report from our Taihang office, 16th] The Administrative Office here, during the voluntary transport campaign, organized the masses to haul goods back while returning from errands ("shaobu jiao"). Military supplies such as homespun cloth and military shoes, which were planned to be moved, were systematically gathered along the transport routes. The work was assigned on a piece-rate basis, allowing the masses to earn money while greatly saving labor for the entire region, achieving two goals at once. According to statistics, the voluntary transport by the masses from 47 villages including Xiazhuang in She County, hauling homespun cloth, military shoes, towels, etc., from areas around Shahe and Cejing, totaled 120,618 jin. With a hauling price of 5 liang of millet per jin, this amounted to 37,693 jin of millet. This saved an estimated 1,200 livestock and 800 handlers (that would have been needed for dedicated transport), which, calculating five days (150 li) for a round trip, saved a total of 6,000 units of animal power and 4,000 units of manpower.

    太行行署组织群众
    义运捎脚一举两得
    【本报太行十六日电】此间行署，于义运中组织群众捎回脚。将准备调动的土布、军鞋等军需品，有计划的集中到运输线上，按支差发价，群众赚了钱，全区又大大的节省了劳力，做到一举两得。据统计仅涉县下庄等四十七个村义运群众，由沙河册井一带捎回土布、军鞋、毛巾等，共十二万零六百一十八斤，每斤脚价小米五两，共合米三万七千六百九十三斤。共节省了（再去搬运所需要的）牲口一千二百头，赶牲口人八百名，以往返五天（一百五十里）计，共节省了畜力六千个、人力四千个。
