　　Qinshui Arranges Winter Production
  　Emphasizing Grasping the Class Line
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 3rd] The Qinshui County Committee convened a meeting of all county, district, and village cadres on November 13th to arrange winter production. First, they reflected on the hiring-poor line in production. Many district and village cadres reflected that they had not paid attention to the leadership of the hired poor and solving their difficulties in the past. Some villages' cooperatives were even manipulated by feudal forces, or most of the shares were held by middle peasants and rich peasants. The Zhanghe Cooperative was once called the best cooperative, but feudal rich peasants held 300,000 yuan in shares in the cooperative. At the same time, cooperatives generally did not dare to lend money to the hired poor, fearing they would not be able to repay the debt. A hired poor man in a certain village wanted to borrow money to engage in transportation, asking for 5,000, but the cooperative only dared to lend 3,000. Conversely, a middle peasant asked for 5,000 and was lent 10,000. Many villages did not pay attention to hired poor women when developing textile production. According to statistics from the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, in the past two years, a total of 101 women weavers using shuttle looms were developed, of which 48 were middle peasants, 20 were targets of struggle, and only 33 were hired poor. The Huaizhuang Cooperative trained five people, and four of them were targets of struggle. They believed that the hired poor were stupid and could not learn, but in reality, they disliked the hired poor for having more production difficulties. Furthermore, many cooperatives hid targets of struggle without cleaning them out, which affected the leadership of the masses in production. After everyone's reflection and examination, the county committee determined that in the future, the organization of cooperatives should take the hired poor as the leading core, so that the surplus capital of the middle peasants can be combined with the labor of the hired poor, vigorously developing small-scale mutual aid cooperatives that combine agriculture and sideline occupations, and control the production of landlords. This winter will focus on the development of textiles, combined with transportation, earnestly solving all the difficulties of the hired poor in production this winter: (1) Cooperatives will tighten their operations and take out a portion of their funds to solve the difficulties of the hired poor. (2) The shares of targets of struggle will be confiscated and their membership will be revoked, and their shares will be lent to the hired poor as production funds. (3) Bank loans will be given priority to the hired poor, and the funds previously lent to targets of struggle will be immediately recovered and lent to the hired poor. (4) Organize carpentry cooperatives to manufacture textile tools for the hired poor, and specifically require the entire county to develop 10,000 spinners, 1,846 weavers, 18,059 spinning wheels, and 2,966 looms this winter. The first, third, and seventh districts will focus on the development of shuttle looms, while the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts will focus on improving technology, striving for balanced development in all villages.

　　沁水布置冬季生产
  　强调掌握阶级路线
    【本报太岳三日电】沁水县委会于十一月十三日召开全县区村干部会议，布置冬季生产。首先反省了生产中雇贫路线。许多区村干部反省出已往未注意雇贫领导与解决雇贫困难，甚至有些村庄的合作社被封建势力操纵，或者股金大部分是中农与富农的。张河合作社曾被称为最好的合作社，而封建富农便在该社入股三十万元。同时一般合作社不敢给雇贫贷款，唯恐还不起帐。某村合作社雇贫想借上钱去搞运输，开口五千，合作社只敢借三千。相反的，中农开口五千，便借给一万。许多村庄发展纺织不注意雇贫妇女。根据四、五、六、七区的统计，近两年来共发展拉梭机织妇一百零一人，其中中农四十八人，斗争对象二十人，雇贫仅三十三人。槐庄合作社培养五人，就有四个斗争对象，他们认为雇贫笨，学不会，其实是嫌雇贫生产困难多。并且许多合作社里隐藏了斗争对象，不加清洗，致影响领导群众生产。县委会根据大家的反省检查后，确定今后组织合作社应以雇贫为领导核心，使中农之剩余资金与雇贫之劳力相结合，大量发展农副业相结合的小型互助合作社，并管制地主生产。今冬则以发展纺织为主，结合运输，认真的解决今冬雇贫生产中的一切困难：（一）合作社紧缩业务，拿出一部分资金为雇贫解决困难。（二）没收斗争对象的股金，并开除其社籍，将其股金借给雇贫作生产资金。（三）银行贷款先尽雇贫，过去贷给斗争对象的款立即收回贷给雇贫。（四）组织木工合作社，为雇贫制造纺织工具，并具体要求全县今冬要发展纺妇一万人，织妇一千八百四十六人，纺车一万八千零五十九架，织机二千九百六十六架。一、三、七区以发展拉梭机为主，二、四、五、六区则以提高技术为主，争取各村发展平衡。
