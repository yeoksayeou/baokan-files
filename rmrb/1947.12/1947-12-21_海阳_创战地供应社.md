Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th. During the Haiyang siege, the frontline supply cooperatives organized in various districts near the battlefield created a new form of wartime supply that benefited both the military and the people. This ensured timely solutions to the needs of the troops, facilitated purchases for the masses, and stabilized wartime prices. The cooperative was jointly formed by the County Government's Industry and Commerce Section, the Chamber of Commerce, and stores to form a working group. Under the unified leadership of the County Support-the-Front Office, the original District Joint Cooperative served as the central cooperative, and village support-the-front supply cooperatives were established by organizing village cooperatives and merchants' capital. Each district reported market conditions and inventory numbers daily for mutual adjustment, exchanging surplus goods for insufficient goods. Goods that were difficult to procure were wholesaled by the supply cooperative stores to each central cooperative, which retained a portion and then issued the rest to the village supply cooperatives at the original price. Locally produced goods were purchased by the village supply cooperative, dispersed among households, and collected as needed. Thus, even though they were ten or twenty li from the front line, it did not affect the "empty fields" policy. If the troops were stationed in villages with cooperatives, the cooperative naturally became the supply cooperative. If the supply could not meet the demand, it would be adjusted at the central cooperative. The central cooperative's address was mostly located in the rear of the troops. Due to the establishment of this type of supply cooperative, during the siege of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Haiyang, cellophane noodles fell from 1,500 yuan per catty to 1,200 yuan, kerosene fell from 2,400 yuan per catty to 2,000 yuan, and other goods maintained their original prices.

  　创战地供应社
    【新华社华东十六日电】海阳围困战中，战地附近各区，组织之支前供应社，创造了军民两利的战时供应新形式，使部队所需能及时得到解决，并便利群众购买，稳定战时物价。该社由县府实业科、商会、商店联合组成工作组，统一在县支前办事处的领导下，以原区联社为中心社，并组织各村合作社及商人的资本成立村支前供应社。各区每天汇报行情及存货数目，以便互相调剂，以货物剩余部分换回不足部分，不易采办之物品由供应社商店批发给各中心社，除中心社留一部分外，再按原价发给村供应社。当地出产的物品，由村供应社买好，分散在各户，随要随集中。这样虽离火线一二十里，亦不影响空室清野。如部队住在有合作社的村庄，合作社即转为当然供应社。如供不应求即到中心社调剂。中心社社址大都设于部队后方所在地，由于这种供应社的建立，在海阳蒋匪被围期间，粉条由每斤一千五百元落至一千二百元，火油每斤两千四百元，落至二千元，其他物品均保持原价。
