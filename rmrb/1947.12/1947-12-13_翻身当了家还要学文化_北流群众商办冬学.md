    After Overthrowing the Old Order and Becoming Masters of Their Own Fate, People Still Need to Learn Culture
    Masses in Beiliu Discuss and Organize Winter School
    [Our newspaper's report from Licheng] Although the poor and landless peasants of Beiliu Village received land and houses in the land reform, they felt they were still one step behind in terms of culture. Village Chief Duan Sixian said, "It's difficult even for me to write a travel permit for everyone. This winter, we must learn to write travel permits, so that next year everyone doesn't have to ask others for help." Poor peasant Liu Youcai personally organized a discussion among poor and landless young men and women: After we overturned the old order last winter, what should we learn this winter? He Sanyu (female) said, "Being illiterate is like being blind. I spent 500 yuan as if it were 50 yuan when buying vegetables. I must learn culture." Li Ruankui (male) said, "In the past, my whole family was illiterate. We bought two mu of land with a 'dead deed,' and that feudal running dog deceived us by writing a 'dead deed' instead of a 'live deed.' Later, others redeemed the land, and we suffered a great loss. I must learn to write contracts." Based on everyone's urgent need for culture, they immediately organized night literacy classes for young men and women, with a total of three groups. Seventeen young men and seventeen young women participated, with the poor and landless as the core. On the evening of December 2nd, they convened a joint meeting of the middle and poor peasant associations and officially held the winter school ceremony. A winter committee was established on the spot, and groups discussed what to learn this winter. Liu Laohu said, "We run a mill, but we can't even find someone to keep accounts. I must learn to keep accounts." Young women like Zhang Shuangying also proposed, based on their own level of education, that they should learn to write diaries this winter, write five articles for the blackboard newspaper each month, and two articles for the county small newspaper. Old man Zhang Baoyou said, "We always say that peasants fought the war and now rule the country, but it's a problem if we are illiterate. I don't even recognize the words on the grain requisition slip. I must learn the words on the requisition slip." Then they discussed the learning methods. Shi Cuilian said, "We should still divide into small winter schools centered on production, combining learning with work. This way, we can be efficient, fast, and not delay production." Everyone unanimously agreed. The village was divided into four small winter schools. In addition to learning at any time within their production units, it was also stipulated that they would go to the small winter schools on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of each month to learn about current affairs, exchange experiences in the whole village on the 10th of each month, and make a summary every month to select learning models.

    翻身当了家还要学文化
    北流群众商办冬学
    【本报黎城讯】北流村贫雇农民在土改中虽然分到土地房屋，但感到在文化上还差一步，村长段四贤说：“我给大家开个路条也困难，今冬总要学会写路条，明年大家就不用求人。”贫农刘有才亲自组织贫雇男女青年讨论：咱们去冬翻了身，今冬应该学习啥？何三玉（女）说：“不识字真是有眼瞎子，我买菜拿五百元票子当五十元化，我总要学文化。”李软魁（男）说：“过去全家不识字，买了二亩死契地，叫那封建走狗把咱欺，写成死契活约，后被人家把地赎走吃了大亏，总要学会写契约。”根据大家对文化的迫切要求，当即组织了男女青年夜间补识班，共三个组，参加男青年十七名，妇女青年十七名，以贫雇为核心，于十二月二号夜召开了中贫农联合会，正式举行了冬学典礼，当场成立了冬委会，分组讨论今冬要学啥？刘牢虎说：“我们开的磨坊，连个记帐的也找不下，我总得学会记帐。”张双英等青年妇女，也根据自己文化程度，提出来今冬要学会作日记，每月要向黑板报写五篇稿，县小报二篇。老汉张保有说：“咱们每天说农民打江山坐天下，不识字这也是个困难，我连个派粮条都不认识，我总要把派条上那些字学会。”接着讨论出学的办法，石翠莲说：“咱还是以生产为中心划分小冬学，结合学习，齐人又快又不耽误生产。”大家一致通过，全村分设小冬学四处，除在本生产单位随时学习外，还规定三、六、九到小冬学学习时事，逢十全村交流经验，每月一总结，评选学习模范。
