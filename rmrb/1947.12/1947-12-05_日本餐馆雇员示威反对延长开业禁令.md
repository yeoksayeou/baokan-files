　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. dispatch from Tokyo: Representatives of 270,000 restaurants and 10,000 employees throughout Japan held a demonstration on the 29th of last month to oppose the Katayama government's extension of the restaurant business closure ban (note: this law was promulgated and implemented in June of this year, originally scheduled to expire at the end of December). The chairman of the demonstration committee declared: MacArthur Headquarters strongly supports the Katayama government's extension of this law. However, facts have proven that closing restaurants does nothing to suppress inflation or prevent rising prices; the demonstration representatives stated that they are determined to fight to overturn this law.

　　日本餐馆雇员示威反对延长开业禁令
    【新华社陕北一日电】东京讯：全日本餐馆二十七万家及雇员一万人之代表，于上月二十九日举行示威运动，反对片山政府延长餐馆开业禁令（按该法令系于今年六月间颁布实行，原定于十二月底满期者）。示威委员会主席宣称：麦克阿瑟总部极力赞助片山政府延长该项法令。然事实证明，封闭餐馆对于压制通货膨胀及阻止上涨之物价无济于事；示威代表表示决为推翻该项法令而奋斗。
