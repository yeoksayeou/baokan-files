　　Who Benefited?
　　Village Cooperative Shouldn't Encroach on Fruits of Struggle
　　[Our newspaper, Changzhi news] In Liujia Village, Third District, during winter production, it was discovered that sixteen tenant farmers and poor peasants lacked capital for production. Village cadres held a meeting to discuss the matter. Lai Xin, chairman of the Farmers' Association, said, "The government knows our village is wealthy and won't give us loans. Tenant farmers and poor peasants are having difficulties. What can we do?" Someone suggested, "The cooperative has fruits of struggle, the militia also has fruits of struggle, and the village treasury also has fruits of struggle. We should take them out to help the tenant farmers and poor peasants with production." Jin Tang and Shunqi said, "The fruits of struggle are the blood and sweat of the masses. They should be used to fill in the gullies and distributed to tenant farmers and poor peasants, not kept in the cooperative for distribution among all levels." Everyone calculated the cooperative's accounts: 76 new middle-peasant households, with shares of 133,000 yuan, averaging 1,750 yuan per household; 101 old middle-peasant households, with shares of 231,500 yuan, averaging 2,280 yuan per household; 10 rich-peasant households, with shares of 75,500 yuan, averaging 7,550 yuan per household; 16 rich-middle-peasant households, with shares of 58,000 yuan, averaging 3,620 yuan per household; and 28 struggle targets (landlords and rich peasants), with a total share of 95,500 yuan, averaging 3,400 yuan per household. They also calculated the dividends allocated to each class: New middle peasants received a total of 466,100 yuan in dividends, old middle peasants received a total of 828,770 yuan, rich peasants received 270,000 yuan, rich middle peasants received 197,600 yuan, and struggle targets received 341,900 yuan. Comparing these figures, it was clear that the shares and dividends of all classes were higher than those of tenant farmers and poor peasants. Keeping the fruits of struggle in the cooperative greatly disadvantaged the tenant farmers and poor peasants. Han Gou said, "Our thinking wasn't clear. We were seeking benefits for the landlords!" Everyone agreed that this provided a solution: take out these fruits of struggle to solve the difficulties of the tenant farmers and poor peasants. A total of 598,205 yuan in fruits of struggle was calculated.

　　[Another News] The Jiaojiazhuang Village Cooperative in the Sixth District of Changzhi has a flour mill and an oil mill, which were opened in April of last year and February of this year, respectively. Out of the village's one hundred households, thirteen are struggle targets, and eighty-seven are middle and poor peasant households. In the flour mill, fourteen households invested, with a total share of 61,000 yuan. The poor peasants' shares were only 24,500 yuan, accounting for 40% of the total shares. A total of fifty-four households invested in the oil mill, including 2,000 yuan from the school and 195,000 yuan from three outside cadres. Forty middle-peasant households invested over 562,000 yuan, while poor-peasant households invested only 47,500 yuan, accounting for only 5.9% of the total shares. The village cadres claim this is a cooperative for the whole village. They have given the cooperative use of grindstones, stone rollers, stone troughs, and large pots, etc., that the masses struggled for, as well as a five-room building and a sixteen-room tile building. Recently, they even had the cooperative cut down a large locust tree, the hard-earned fruit of the poor peasants’ labor, and a large locust tree, a village asset, at extremely low prices. Leading cadres should pay close attention to this disguised phenomenon of encroaching on the fruits of the poor peasants’ labor and must not allow the poor households to continue to suffer losses.

　　看谁沾了光？
  　村合作社不该侵用果实
    【本报长治讯】三区六家村，冬季生产中，发现有十六户雇贫没有生产本钱，村干部即开会讨论，农会主席来心说：“政府知道咱村富，不给咱贷款，雇贫有困难，咱有什么办法？”有人提出：合作社有斗争果实，民兵拿的也有斗争果实，村财政里也有斗争果实，应该拿出来帮助雇贫生产。金堂、顺气说：“斗争果实是群众的血汗，应该是填圪道分给雇贫，不应该放在合作社各阶层都分”。大家把合作社算了一下帐：新中农七十六户，入股洋十三万三千元，每户平均一七五○元；旧中农一百零一户，股洋二三一五○○元，每户平均二二八○元；富农十户，股洋七五五○○元，每户平均七五五○元；富中农十六户，股洋五八○○○元，每户平均三六二○元；斗争对象（地主富农）二八户，共入股洋九五五○○元，每户平均三四○○元。又算各阶层批红，新中农共批利四六六一○○元，旧中农共批洋八二八七七○元，富农共批洋二七○○○○元，富中农共批洋一九七六○○元，斗争对象共批红利三四一九○○元。这样对比看出，各阶层股金批红利都比雇贫多，把斗争果实放在合作社，雇贫吃了大亏。憨狗说：“咱思想不明确，给地主谋了利益啦”。大家都说：这就有了办法啦，把这些果实取出解决雇贫困难。共算出斗争果实五九八二○五元。　　　　（存孝、肥则）
    【又讯】长治六区焦家庄村合作社有粉坊、油坊两处，是去年四月和今年二月先后开的。全村一百户，有十三户斗争对象，八十七户中贫农。粉坊里有十四户入股，股金六万一千元，贫农股仅两万四千五百元，占总股金百分之四十。油坊投资者共五十四户，有学校二千元，三个外边干部十九万五千元；中农四十户股金洋五十六万二千余元，贫农股金四万七千五百元，仅占总股金百分之五点九。村干部说这是全村的合作社，把群众斗争出来的×磨、×碾、石槽、大锅等家具，及五间楼房、十六间瓦房归合作社使用，最近又将贫苦农民的血汗果实大槐树一株，和村公产大槐树一株，以极低价钱叫合作社伐了。这种变相的侵吞贫苦农民果实的现象，领导干部应很好注意，不能叫贫苦户继续吃亏下去。
