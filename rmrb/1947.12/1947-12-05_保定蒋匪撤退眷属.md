Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 3rd: After our army liberated Shijiazhuang and annihilated over 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Baoding were terrified and uneasy. The Baoding Pacification Commissioner's Office and various Party, government, military police, and secret service agencies have been sending their dependents to Beiping (Peiping). Chiang Kai-shek agency employees who wanted to escape but could not, secretly prepared plain clothes, planning to disguise themselves as merchants if necessary. Chiang Kai-shek police teams in outer strongholds of Baoding, such as Nandaran and Nangoutou, began moving supplies into Baoding city from the 15th and 16th of last month. Large capitalist merchants in the city, such as the China Textile Industries Corporation office, rushed to transport their stocks. The streets were crowded with vehicles and horses, in a chaotic state. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits forcibly conscripted a large number of laborers to dig the second city moat and the moat around the city day and night, and forced the demolition of all civilian houses within 400 meters outside the city wall and the second city moat. Work began on the south gate on the 17th of last month, and the residents complained bitterly.

　　保定蒋匪撤退眷属
    【新华社晋察冀三日电】我军解放石庄歼灭蒋匪二万余人后，保定蒋匪惊心丧胆惶恐不安。保定蒋匪绥靖公署办事处及党、政、宪、特各机关纷纷将眷属送往北平。欲逃不得的蒋匪机关职员，则秘密预备便衣，打算必要时化装商人，保定外围据点如南大冉、南沟头等地蒋匪保警队，于上月十五、六日起将物资搬往保定城内，城内官僚资本大商号如中纺办事处等，则争先恐后将存货运走。街上车马拥挤，乱成一片。蒋匪强征大量民夫，不分昼夜挖掘二道市沟及护城河，并强迫城墙及二道市沟外四百米以内之民房一律拆除，南关已于上月十七日开始动工，居民怨声载道。
