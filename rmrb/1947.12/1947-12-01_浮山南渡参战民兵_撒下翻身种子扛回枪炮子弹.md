　　Fushan Nantou Militiamen Join the War
  　Sowing the Seeds of Liberation and Carrying Back Guns, Cannons, and Bullets
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 27th] A battalion of Fushan militiamen crossed the Yellow River to the south on August 14th, following the Chen-Xie army in combat, and returned victoriously on October 30th. Over the course of two months, they escorted the wounded 13 times, escorted ammunition more than 20 times, guarded prisoners 15 times, pursued routed enemy soldiers 6 times, killed or wounded 4 bandits, and seized 96 rifles, 11 telephones, 3 pistols, over 10,000 rounds of ammunition, over 20 greatcoats, over 100 military uniforms, over 300 catties of gasoline, and 17 small cannon shells. In addition, they paid attention to mass work. When they were stationed in Focun, Shanzhou, comrades such as Zhu Tixiang and Zhang Dingyi formed four armed work groups to go deep into nearby villages to mobilize the masses to distribute grain and land. For example, when Zhu Tixiang's group mobilized the masses in Focun, they adopted the method of linking the bitterness of one person to the bitterness of another, guiding the suffering people to express their pain, and then linking the suffering of one person to the suffering of another, uniting 84 suffering people, struggling against the puppet county magistrate Zhang Kejun, and distributing 15 shi of grain, 800 to 900 zhang of cloth, over 40 quilts, over 10 blankets, over 200 bundles, and countless other furniture. They also adopted the method of distributing as they struggled, distributing the fruits to the masses and then promptly organizing village governments and peasant associations. Other groups also cultivated activists and cadres in their respective villages, sowing the seeds of struggle and igniting the flames of struggle. They truly felt that all the farmers in the world are one family, and they were warmly received wherever they went. When they left, the masses beat gongs and drums, seeing them off for more than a li, reluctant to part, and some of the core masses even shed tears.

　　浮山南渡参战民兵
  　撒下翻身种子扛回枪炮子弹
    【本报太岳二十七日电】浮山民兵一个营，于八月十四日南渡黄河，随从陈谢大军作战，十月三十日胜利归来。两个月来护送伤员十三次、护送弹药二十余次，看守俘虏十五次，追击溃兵六次，毙伤匪四名，缴获步枪九十六枝，电话机十一部，手枪三枝，子弹万余发，大衣二十余件，军衣一百余件，汽油三百余斤，小炮弹十七个；此外，还注意群众工作。他们在陕州佛村驻防时，由朱提祥、张定一等同志，组成四个武装工作小组，深入附近各村发动群众分粮分田。如朱提祥组，在佛村发动群众时，采用以苦串苦的办法，引导苦人诉出自己的痛苦，又以苦人串苦人，串通起八十四个苦人，斗争了伪县长张克俊，分到粮食十五石、布八九百丈、被子四十余条、毯子十余条、包袱二百多个，其他家具无数。并采用随斗随分办法，将果实分到群众手里后，及时组织起村政权和农会。其他各组，也都在各所在村培养出积极分子和干部，撒下了斗争种子，点起斗争火焰。他们真正感到天下农民是一家，走到那里也亲热；当他们走的时候，群众打着锣鼓，欢送一里多远，恋恋不舍，有些基本群众甚至流泪。
