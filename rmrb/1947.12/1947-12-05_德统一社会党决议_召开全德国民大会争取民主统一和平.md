It also called on all anti-fascist parties and democratic organizations to send representatives to the meeting. The agenda of the meeting is as follows: 1. Reports and debates on the German people's determination to strive for a just peace and a democratically unified Germany; 2. Election of a delegation to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference.
