Weekly Comprehensive War Report:

    East China:
    In the Jiao Dong Campaign, which lasted for over a month, we have achieved a decisive victory. After the People's Liberation Army (PLA) recovered Haiyang on the 11th, it recovered Laiyang City, the political center of the Jiao Dong liberated area, on the night of the 13th. All of the more than 10,000 defending enemy troops, including Chiang Kai-shek's main forces and security regiments, were annihilated without a single one escaping. At the same time, another PLA unit defeated eight brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's reinforcements, including the reorganized 64th Division, reorganized 9th Division, reorganized 8th Army (recently expanded from the reorganized 8th Division), and the New 74th Division, in the Shuigoutou area, 40 li southwest of Laiyang. From the 10th to the 13th, in four days, they killed, wounded, and captured more than 3,000 enemy soldiers. Prior to this, on the 8th, another PLA unit pursued the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek troops from Huang County in the Qinjia Village and Mating areas on the outskirts of Longkou City, annihilating over 500 enemy soldiers. The Jiao Dong Campaign, which lasted for over a month, extended the battle line for hundreds of li, developing from a blocking war to a long-distance pursuit war, and then to a large-scale encirclement and annihilation war. Now, except for a few precarious isolated strongholds along the narrow coastal strip from Longkou to Yantai and the northern coast of Weihaiwei, the vast Jiao Dong area has returned to the hands of the people. On the 12th, Chiang Kai-shek's "Central News Agency" was still boasting wildly: "The National Army is firmly defending Laiyang" and so on, but only one night later, Laiyang was captured by us; the "Central News Agency's" bragging was once again exposed as a lie. But the most tragic fate is yet to come; Chiang Kai-shek's troops will further suffer heavier and continuous blows from the People's Liberation Army, until they are finally wiped out within this tightly closed Jiao Dong Peninsula.
    The Central China southern front offensive has achieved significant victories. In the ten days from the 30th of last month to the 9th of this month, with the cooperation of local armed forces and the assistance of the broad masses of liberated peasants, the PLA, from north to south, successively destroyed the three lines of defense controlled by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in central Jiangsu, namely the Tai (xian) - Hai (an) - @ (Cha) line, the Tai (xing) - Huang (qiao), Ru (gao) - Jue (gang) line, and the Tai (xian) - Tai (xing) - Jing (jiang) - Tong (Nantong) - Hai (men) - Qi (men) line. All bridges and telephone lines on the highways were almost completely destroyed, and the entire Chiang Kai-shek's transportation system in central Jiangsu was paralyzed. In ten days, a total of over 6,000 Chiang Kai-shek regular army and local troops were annihilated, and over 50 Chiang Kai-shek strongholds were removed. Batches of reactionary regimes were also swept away, forcing Chiang Kai-shek's troops to shrink into a few isolated cities and a small number of strongholds. The vast rural areas were liberated and connected into one contiguous area. Under the shock of our offensive, Chiang Kai-shek's troops were terrified and attempted to piece together reinforcements to save their lives.
    Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan:
    Since the main forces of our PLA went south in August, this area has mainly intensified the work of clearing out the remaining enemies in the inner lines and consolidating and expanding the liberated areas, achieving great results. Isolated strongholds such as Yongnian and Yuanshi have been removed, and more than 20 cities such as Meng County, Qinyang, Xiangling, Xia County, and Yuncheng have been recovered. The vast area south of the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan has been liberated, completely compressing the enemy into marginal points and lines. The enemy has fallen into a purely defensive posture. North of the Longhai Railway, we have controlled 127 county towns, completely connected into one area, with a population of 30 million. In the past half month, our local internal line corps, local armed forces, and militia have actively launched a struggle to protect grain, taking the initiative to attack the enemy and achieving continuous victories. On the 4th, our Meng County Independent Battalion and the militias of Yangcheng and Jiyuan counties intercepted more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek's Meng County and Jiyuan "Security Regiments" that had fled to Mengjin and were attempting to cross the river and invade. They killed over 130 bandits, including Lei Mingxuan, the lieutenant colonel deputy commander, and captured over 90. On the same day, our another unit raided an outer stronghold outside the north gate of Yuncheng, annihilating an entire platoon of Lei Wenqing's unit and the Yi's security police force, killing and capturing 82. On the 6th, they ambushed over 700 Yan Xishan's bandit police force from Dongwang and Sanjiazhuang north of Anyi, completely defeating them, killing and capturing over 50. Our troops along the Tongpu Railway, in their struggle to protect grain, have maneuvered and attacked, annihilating a total of 580 bandits in 25 days of fighting since November, severely打击打打击阎阎阎匪匪匪抢抢抢粮粮粮凶焰凶焰凶焰。。
    Southern New District:
    The mass emancipation movement of distributing grain, equalizing land, and arming for self-defense is flourishing with the consolidation and development of the democratic government. In the new Su-Lu-Yu-Wan district, hundreds of thousands of people in Shangshui, Shangcai, Xiangcheng, and Runan counties have been involved in the struggle. Now, on the plains of more than 300 li south of the Sha River, Chiang Kai-shek's county and district ruling organizations have collapsed, and the orders of the patriotic democratic government are unobstructed. In the eastern Hubei area of ​​the Hubei-Henan-Anhui New District, the peasant land distribution struggle has been universally launched in 15 counties. From north of Macheng to the banks of the Yangtze River in Qichun, Huangmei, and Guangji, for four to five hundred li from north to south, peasant ranks fighting local tyrants and distributing spoils can be seen everywhere. The movement to distribute grain and wealth has developed from the initial actions of a few people to organized mass actions of hundreds and thousands of people, from single villages to joint actions of several or dozens of villages. In Linru, Baofeng, Luoning and other places in the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei New District, the masses are carrying out an emancipation struggle. In recent days, more than 200 people have voluntarily joined the army or organized guerrilla groups to fight against landlords and local despots.
    Northeast:
    The soldiers and civilians of eastern Hebei launched another major sabotage campaign against the Beining Railway. On the night of the 9th, a certain local corps of our army, in coordination with more than 2,000 militiamen from Ninghe and Fengrun counties, sabotaged six li of railway from Tianzhuang to Zhao Jilingzhuang, 35 kilometers southwest of Tangshan. On the night of the 10th, another unit of our army advanced to the section from Luan County to Changli, echoing Tianzhuang from east to west, and successively captured Zhugezhuang, Shimen, and Anshan stations, annihilating a part of the 8th Traffic Police Column of Chiang Kai-shek's troops and destroying 12 li of railway. On the morning of the 11th, troops from the 157th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 62nd Army and the 5th Traffic Police Column, each about 300 strong, harassed from Hetou and Guye, but were defeated by us, annihilating and capturing 165 enemy soldiers. The Chiang Kai-shek troops from the 151st Division and the local association units, besieged in the isolated city of Leting south of the Beining Railway, were frightened by the power of our army, abandoned the city and fled north. The city was then recovered by us.
    Chiang Kai-shek's troops, trapped in Jilin and Siping, are starving and freezing, and have been launching raids to seize grain for days, which have been effectively blocked by us, annihilating more than 2,100 enemy soldiers. On the 9th and 10th, our army annihilated a large part of three battalions of the 91st Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 71st Army and the Liaobei Security Regiment, a total of over 1,100 soldiers, in Dawai southwest of Siping and Taiping River east of Bamiancheng. From the 7th to the 9th, the Chiang Kai-shek troops from the 182nd Division of the 60th Army, the Provisional 21st Division, and the Provisional 52nd Division, a total of more than two regiments, launched raids to seize grain in Jiuzhan, Ertaizi, and other places northwest and southwest of Jilin. After being severely attacked by our army, a total of 404 enemy officers and soldiers below the rank of lieutenant were wounded, and 588 captured, including company commanders and below. On the 29th of last month, the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army captured Tongjiangkou northwest of Tieling, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 150 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers of the 22nd Division of the New 6th Army, including company commanders and below.

    胶东大战我取得决定性胜利
    南线新区群众运动蓬勃展开
    十一月十一日至十七日一周综合战报：
    华东：
    持续月余之胶东大战，我已获决定性胜利。解放军十一日收复海阳后，又于十三日夜收复胶东解放区政治中心莱阳城，守敌蒋匪主力及保安团队等一万余名悉数就歼，无一漏网。与此同时，解放军另部在莱阳西南四十里之水沟头一带击溃增援蒋匪整六四师、整九师、整八军（最近由整八师扩编）、新七四师等部共八个旅兵力，自十日迄十三日四天中，共毙伤俘敌三千余名。先此，八日另部我军追击黄县逃窜之蒋匪于龙口市郊秦家村、马亭一带，歼敌五百余。持续月余之胶东大战，战线延长数百里，由阻击战发展至长距离追击战，再发展至大规模围歼战。现除龙口至烟台、威海卫北海岸狭长一线几个摇摇欲坠的孤立据点外，广大胶东地区已重归人民之手。十二日蒋匪“中央社”犹在大肆吹牛：“国军固守莱阳”如何如何，但仅隔一夜，莱阳即为我攻克；“中央社”这一次牛皮又吹炸了。但最悲惨的命运还在后头，蒋匪必将进一步遭到解放军更惨重的连续打击，直至最后覆灭在这关紧了大门的胶东半岛之内。
    华中南线攻势已获得重大胜利。自上月三十日至本月九日之十天中，解放军在地方武装配合与广大翻身农民的援助下，由北而南，先后摧毁了蒋匪控制苏中的三道防线，即泰（县）海（安）＠（茶）线，泰（兴）黄（桥）、如（皋）掘（港）线，及泰（县）泰（兴）靖（江）通（南通）海（门）启（门）线，所有公路上之桥梁电话，几全部被毁，整个苏中蒋匪交通陷于瘫痪。十天中，共歼灭蒋匪正规军及地方部队共六千余众，拔除蒋匪据点五十余处，并扫除成批的反动政权，迫使蒋匪蜷缩几座孤城及少数据点内。广大农村获得解放，并连成一片。在我攻势声威震慑下，吓得蒋匪丧魂落魄，妄图拼凑增援救命。
    晋冀鲁豫：
    自八月间我各解放军主力南征后，该区主要在内线加紧肃清残敌，巩固与扩大解放区，获得很大成绩。拔除永年、元氏等孤立据点，收复孟县、沁阳、襄陵、夏县、郓城等城市二十余座，解放了冀鲁豫黄河以南广大地区，将敌完全压缩于边沿点线内，敌已陷于单纯防御态势。在陇海路北，我已控制一百二十七座县城，完全结成一片，拥有人口三千万。半月来我各地内线兵团及地武民兵积极展开护粮斗争，主动出击敌人，连续获得胜利。四日我孟县独立营及阳城、济源两县民兵阻击渡河北犯的流亡孟津之蒋匪孟县、济源“保安团”千余人，毙匪上校副总指挥雷明轩以下一百三十余名，俘九十余。同日晚我另部袭入运城北关外围据点，将敌雷文清一个排及流亡猗氏保警队全部歼灭，毙俘八十二名。六日又伏击出犯安邑以北东王、三家庄之阎匪保警队七百余，将其全部击溃，毙俘五十余名，同蒲沿线我军，在护粮斗争中机动出击，自十一月份以来二十五天战斗中共歼匪五百八十余，阎匪抢粮凶焰遭受重大打击。
    南线新区：
    分粮均地武装自卫的群众翻身运动，随着民主政权的巩固发展，正日益蓬勃开展。苏鲁豫皖新区商水、上蔡、项城、汝南诸县已有数百万人民卷入斗争。现沙河南岸纵横三百多里的平原上，蒋记县区统治机构已土崩瓦解，爱国民主政府的政令通行无阻。鄂豫皖新区之鄂东地区，农民分田斗争已在十五县中普遍展开，从麻（城）北到蕲（春）黄（梅）广（济）的长江岸边，南北四五百里地区，到处可见打土豪、分浮财的农民行列，分粮分财运动已由最初少数人的行动，发展到成百成千有组织的群众行动，由单个村发展至几个或几十个村的联合行动。豫陕鄂新区临汝、宝丰、洛（宁）南等地群众正在进行翻身斗争，连日已有二百余人自动参军，或组织游击小组和地主土顽斗争。
    东北：
    冀东军民再度向北宁路展开大破击战。九日晚，我某地方兵团配合宁河、丰润两县民兵两千余破击唐山西南三十五公里之田庄至赵鸡翎庄段铁路六里。我另部于十日晚挺进滦县至昌黎段，与田庄一线东西呼应，先后攻占朱各庄、石门及安山车站，歼蒋匪交通警察第八纵队一部，破坏铁路十二里，十一日上午蒋匪六二军一五七师及交警第五纵队各约三百余，分由河头、古冶出扰，被我击溃，歼俘敌一百六十五名。北宁路南乐亭孤城蒋匪一五一师及伙会各一部慑于我军声威，乃弃城北窜，该城当为我收复。
    困守吉林、四平两城饥寒交迫的蒋匪连日出动抢粮，遭我有力阻击，共歼敌二千一百余。九、十两日我军在四平西南之大洼及八面城以东之太平河，歼灭出动抢粮之蒋匪七一军九一师三个营大部及辽北保安团共一千一百余名。吉林蒋匪六十军一八二师一个团、暂二十一师及暂五二师共两个多团，七日至九日分向吉林西北及西南之九站、二台子等地抢粮，经我军迎头痛击，计伤匪尉官以下四百零四名，俘连长以下五百八十八名。内蒙人民自卫军上月二十九日攻克铁岭西北之通江口，毙伤俘蒋匪新六军二十二师连长以下一百五十余名。
