　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 4th. The people of Shijiazhuang, just rescued from dire straits, have suffered repeated and frantic bombings by Chiang bandits. To this day, Chiang-American bandit planes continue to harass them daily. Many innocent compatriots have been bombed to death, houses have been destroyed. The people's houses in the Fuxing Road East Entrance area of the city's First District have been reduced to ruins. Seventy or eighty houses on Chaoyang Road and Datong Street have collapsed. In a cave on the east side of a factory, forty or fifty ordinary people were hiding, and all were bombed to death in the cave. Luo Xiaozhao, a worker grinding wheat, had four of his family of five killed. Luo Xiaozhao himself was injured by the bombing. A civilian house was shaken down, and all ten members of the family were killed or seriously injured. The people of Shijiazhuang are not afraid but have unparalleled hatred for this inhuman atrocity of the Chiang bandits. Workers have joined the trade union one after another, and poor people have joined the poor people's groups. Millions of workers and poor citizens have participated in fire fighting and rescue and patrol teams, undertaking the work of protecting factories and investigating Chiang Kai-shek's remnants. Under the assistance of the democratic municipal government, the people of Shijiazhuang under the bombing are actively carrying out various recovery work with unparalleled enthusiasm. Shijiazhuang Municipal Middle School, the former Provincial Commercial Vocational School, the Municipal Private Shimen Middle School, Girls' Middle School, and Jianguo Middle School officially started joint classes on the 24th of last month. Elementary schools throughout the city have also resumed classes one after another, and shops have also resumed business. The democratic government also entrusted the trading company to set up two supply and sales offices in the city to supply and sell food to the citizens, and workers and poor people can get a 10% discount on purchases.

　　蒋美匪机暴行激怒石庄人民
    工人贫民组织起来积极进行恢复工作
    【新华社晋察冀四日电】刚从水深火热中拯救出来的石庄人民，迭遭蒋匪疯狂轰炸，迄今每天仍不断有蒋美匪机骚扰，许多无辜同胞被炸死，房屋被炸毁，市一区复兴路东口路等一带民房已成废墟，朝阳路大同街七八十间民房被炸塌，某工厂东侧一个地洞里，躲着四五十个老百姓，全被炸死在洞里，磨麦工人罗小皂一家五口被炸死四个，罗小皂本人则被炸伤。某家民房被震塌，全家十口被炸死或受重伤。石庄人民对蒋匪此种残无人性的暴行，不是害怕而是无比的仇恨，工人纷纷参加工会，贫民参加贫民小组，并有千万工友和贫苦市民参加消防救护及纠察队，担负着保卫工厂、清查蒋伪残余等工作。轰炸下的石庄人民在民主市政府协助下，正以无比的热忱积极进行各项恢复工作。石庄市立中学、前省立商科职业学校、市私立石门中学、女中、建国中学等已于上月二十四日正式开始联合复课。全市各小学亦纷纷复课，各商店铺亦恢复营业。民主政府并委托贸易公司在市内设供售市两处，供售市民食粮，工人贫民购买均可获九折优待。
