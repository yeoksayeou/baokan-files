　　Children Collect Firewood to Support the Resistance

　　[Our newspaper's Julu dispatch] All 58 male students of Dazhangzhuang Elementary School in the Second District, led by their teachers, actively collected firewood to support the resistance, so that the soldiers at the front could fight the Chiang bandits with greater peace of mind. Everyone enthusiastically volunteered. University students over the age of thirteen pledged to collect 80 to 90 catties of firewood per day, while those under twelve pledged to collect 45 to 50 catties of firewood per day. At that time, everyone also reported the specific amount they had completed. Everyone was determined to help solve the problem of firewood shortage for impoverished families of those resisting [the enemy] this winter. Many active students were discovered during the firewood collection. For example, Wang Zhenshan, who is only twelve years old, collected 70 catties of firewood a day. Wang Yanmin, who is only thirteen years old, pledged to collect 70 catties of firewood a day, but ended up collecting 95 catties. In one day, all 58 students collected a total of 3,600 catties of firewood. All the students were very happy. (Yong Xian)
