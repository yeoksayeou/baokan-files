Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi, 29th. Correspondent Han Yun reports: Farmers in the new districts are actively joining the People's Liberation Army on their own initiative. During the first liberation of Nanzhao City earlier this month, over twenty farmers from that county joined the army, bringing their own weapons from home. As a certain unit moved through southwestern Henan, people along the way requested to join the army. A certain regiment accepted fifteen farmers into its ranks in succession. Niu Daitang, a 22-year-old poor peasant from a village in Fangcheng, used to flee everywhere to avoid being conscripted by the Chiang bandits. This time, he traveled all the way to Yangcezhen in Biyang to find the Liberation Army and join up. Another farmer, Ding Wenshan, automatically carried a stretcher for five miles when the Liberation Army passed through his village. When it was time for a stretcher shift change and he was asked to return home, he requested to join the army. In areas along the northern front that have been liberated for a longer period and where the masses have been initially mobilized, joining the army is even more enthusiastic. In a village north of the Luo River under the jurisdiction of Yiyang, the masses vied to join the army, and in some cases, two brothers competed with each other to enlist. In a certain sub-district along the Luo River, more than 800 people have already joined local armed forces and militia.

　　豫西新区农民自带武器参军
    【新华社豫鄂陕前线二十九日电】随军记者寒云报导：新区农民纷纷自动参加人民解放军，月初第一次解放南召城时，该县就有二十多个农民由家里自带武器参军。某部在豫西南活动中，沿路都有人请求参军。某团先后就接受了十五个农民入伍。方城某村二十二岁的贫农牛代唐，过去到处逃避蒋匪抓丁，而这次一直跑到泌阳的羊册镇找到解放军参军。另一农民丁文山，当解放军由他村里经过时，自动抬担架走了五里，担架换班时，要他回去，他便请求入伍。北线解放较久，群众初步发动之地区，入伍更形踊跃。宜阳所属洛河北岸某村，群众争相参军，且有兄弟两人互争参军的。洛河沿岸某分区已有八百余人参加地方武装及民兵。
