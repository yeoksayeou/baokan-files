　　Yexian Militia Launches Propaganda War
　　Attacks Behind Enemy Lines to Dissolve "Secret Societies"
　　Villagers in Wuzhi County Spontaneously Resist Chiang

　　[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Wan Weimi and other traitors and puppets in the Sixth District of Yexian County deceived and forced the masses to organize "secret societies" to resist us. Guocun, Liyuan, and other villages, because no one was in the society, sent 500 people to eat there for three days. The masses in each village, under deception and coercion, organized themselves into secret societies. At that time, our Sixth District neglected the work of winning over and disintegrating the enemy's secret societies, and simply adopted armed attacks. As a result, we transferred out and couldn't penetrate.
　　On the evening of October 31st, the Sixth District Militia Work Team, in coordination with the Ninth District of Anyang, divided into three routes to attack behind enemy lines, and the enemy was frightened away from strongholds such as San Shilipu and Liyuan. Then, a propaganda war was launched, shouting to the enemy and the masses behind enemy lines about the victory of our great counter-offensive and opposing the enemy's looting of grain and conscription. To the members of the "secret societies," we said: "The enemy forces you to join the society, you are at the front in battles, you don't get food or drink, you have to stand guard, and you can't produce. Who are you doing this for?" In this battle, we obtained one grenade and two homemade pistols. We explained our policy to the three captured members of the "secret societies": "Those forced to join are declared innocent," and then immediately released them.
　　From our actual actions, the members of the "secret societies" recognized our policy towards them. The next day, when we went behind enemy lines again, many villages contacted us and communicated with us, and stopped fighting us. At the same time, the enemy became panicked and concentrated in one stronghold, which greatly facilitated our work.
　　As a result, the situation in the Sixth District was reopened, and the morale of cadres and militiamen was even higher. (Zhang Yusheng)
　　[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Wuzhi] After the enemy occupied Mulandiandian and the breach of the Dafen River embankment in the Seventh District of Wuzhi, it became a guerrilla zone. Chiang Kai-shek's miscellaneous troops constantly impersonated the Eighth Route Army to disturb and rob the masses. The masses knew that the Eighth Route Army was for the people and would not rob things. On the night of the 8th of this month, more than ten Chiang bandits robbed the masses in a certain village. As soon as they left the village, they were attacked by the masses with homemade guns and cannons. The enemy fled in panic, and two yellow cows and many clothes were intercepted. (Fu Jintang)

　　邺县民兵展开宣传战
    出击敌后瓦解会门
    武陟某村群众自动抗蒋
    【本报讯】顽伪汪怀泌等，在我邺县六区欺骗与强迫群众组织“会门”，抵抗我们。郭村、黎园等村，因没人在会，即派了五百人去吃了三天。各村群众在被骗被迫的情况下，都把会门组织起来。我六区当时对敌人会门，忽视了争取与瓦解工作，单纯采取了武装打击，结果弄得转移出来，插不进去。
    十月三十一日晚，六区民兵武工队，配合安阳九区，分三路打回敌后，三十里铺、黎园等据点，将敌吓跑，遂即展开宣传战，向敌人及敌后群众喊话，讲我们大反攻胜利消息，反对敌人抢粮抓丁，对会门说：“敌人强迫你们在会，打仗在前，吃喝轮不上咱，又叫站岗，又不叫生产，你们是为的谁？”这次战斗，得手榴弹一个，土手枪两枝，对捉住的三个会门，讲明了我们的政策：“强迫在会宣布无罪”就马上放回。
    会门从我们的实际行动中，认清了我们对会门的政策，第二天我们又到敌后，好多村纷纷和我们接头通气，不再和我们打了。同时敌人倒恐慌起来，都集中在一个据点住，大大的便利了我们开展工作。
    这样一来，六区的局面重新打开，干部和民兵的情绪更加高涨起来。（张玉生）
    【本报武陟讯】武陟七区从敌占木栾店与大樊河堤决口后，即成为游击区。蒋匪杂牌不断冒充八路军扰乱抢劫群众，群众知道八路军是为人民，不会抢东西。本月八日夜十余蒋匪到某村抢了群众，刚出村被群众用土枪、土炮乱打，敌仓惶逃跑，截下黄牛两头，和许多衣服。（傅金堂）
