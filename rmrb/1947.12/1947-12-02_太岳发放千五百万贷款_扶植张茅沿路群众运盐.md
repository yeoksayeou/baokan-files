　　Taiyue Issues 15 Million Loan
  　Supporting People Along Zhangmao Road Transporting Salt
    [This newspaper Taiyue 29th dispatch] The Taiyue Jinan Bank has issued 15 million in local currency to support the people along the Zhangdian-Maojindu highway in transporting salt. Before the war, the people in this area transported large quantities of salt to Henan and Shaanxi provinces every winter, accounting for 60 percent of the salt produced in the salt ponds. However, after the Japanese invasion, and more recently, the Kuomintang bandits' frantic looting, all the transportation livestock were looted and transportation equipment was destroyed. Therefore, the Jinan Bank issued loans to restore local transportation. Currently, all bank cadres have gone deep into the villages to conduct investigations, determined to ensure that this loan truly reaches the hands of poor and hired peasants. According to the investigation, the area is 110 li away from the Yuncheng salt ponds, and a round trip takes only two days. Each animal can carry 180 to 200 jin, and a round trip can earn 6,000 yuan. If a peasant household borrows 80,000 yuan from the bank and prepares another 50,000 yuan to buy an animal, they can repay the principal in just two months. On average, they can earn a profit of 200,000 yuan this winter in three months, and can also increase the number of livestock by 450 to 500 head.

　　太岳发放千五百万贷款
  　扶植张茅沿路群众运盐
    【本报太岳廿九日电】太岳冀南银行，以本币一千五百万元，扶植张（店）、茅（津渡）公路一带群众运输食盐。战前该地群众，每年冬季即大量运输食盐至河南陕西两地，达盐池出盐百分之六十，但在日寇侵占以后，近又加蒋匪之疯狂掠夺，所有运输牲口被抢一空，运输用具亦遭破坏，因此冀南银行发放贷款恢复当地运输。现银行全体干部，已深入各村进行调查，决使此一贷款真正发到贫雇农手中。据调查，该地距运城盐池一百一十里，有两天即可来回，每一牲口以驮一百八十至二百斤计，往返一趟便可赚洋六千元。一户农民如在银行贷款八万元，再自备五万元买一牲口，只要两个月就可还本，平均今冬三月便可得利二十万元，又可增加牲口四百五十至五百头。
