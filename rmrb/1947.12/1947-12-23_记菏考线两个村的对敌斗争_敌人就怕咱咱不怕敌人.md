A Record of the Struggle Against the Enemy in Two Villages on the He-Kao Line
The Enemy Fears Us, But We Do Not Fear the Enemy

Zhangdiquan and Jiepai villages, located in the northwest corner of the fifth district of Kaocheng, are only eight or nine li away from the enemy stronghold of Zhuangzhai, and the He (Ze) - Kao (Cheng) highway passes outside the west gate of Zhuangzhai. The two villages are only one li apart from each other east to west. A long time ago, the Yellow River branched out in this area, and the people built dikes to prevent flooding, so two dikes connected the two villages from west to east. These two villages were originally old liberated areas. Since falling into the hands of the Kuomintang last autumn, one day in July, a company of the Kuomintang's 429th Regiment, in coordination with local bullies, sneaked into Zhangdiquan village and forcibly demanded 3,000 jin of wheat. The villagers had no choice but to scrape together 1,000 jin, suppressing their anger and speaking kindly to the enemy to settle the matter. Who knew that when the enemy left, they suddenly grabbed twelve women. Two young women were raped in the western fields, covered in mud. Han Xueli, an activist in the village, saw this and his eyes were filled with anger. He could no longer endure it. He immediately dug out a locally made gun from a water pit and fired at the enemy along the main street. The enemy, not knowing what was happening, panicked and desperately fled west, abandoning ten women. After this fight, the guns in Zhangdiquan were revealed, and the villagers began to fight the enemy openly. A few days later, activists Han Xueshu, Han Xueli, and others led the villagers in a struggle against six evil landlords, including Yang Zhangyu, seizing floating wealth of 1,800 jin of wheat, one and a half shi of corn and sorghum, seven heads of sorghum, fifty jin of cotton, and many dowries and clothes. They struggled in the morning and distributed the loot in the afternoon, finishing only after supper. After the distribution, some villagers were worried, fearing that the enemy would come later and it would all be over, but most villagers said, "If we want to stand up, we have to risk everything!" The next day, Jiepai village also began to struggle against floating wealth. Four militiamen stood guard in the fields. Five landlords were kept in one house. Activists led the masses to bring the landlords' floating wealth to the street. In the afternoon, Han Shangyi, the puppet town chief of Baimao, attacked with forty people. When everyone saw the enemy approaching, they hid most of the floating wealth. After the enemy entered the village, they saw things all over the street and shouted wildly, "If anyone finds another thing, I will execute them!" and injured villager Wang Si. At this time, Han Xueli from Zhangdiquan ran to the north dike and fired several shots at Jiepai, then ran to the south dike and fired several shots at Jiepai. Subsequently, comrades from the county brigade came to reinforce them and fought all the way to the north gate of Jiepai, causing the enemy to flee. From then on, the enemy paid special attention to these two villages. The villagers of these two villages broke with the enemy. Local bandits attacked Zhangdiquan five or six times a day, but were all repelled and never managed to enter the village. One day, three enemies carried three bundles of sorghum stalks, with guns hidden inside. As soon as they entered the north side of Jiepai, Han Xueli turned to the northeast corner of Jiepai, "Bang, bang,..." firing several shots. The enemies were so frightened that they fled in disarray. Village cadres and the masses were constantly vigilant against the enemy. In the actual struggle, the masses deeply felt the importance of armed struggle, so they obtained several more guns for the militia. The combat effectiveness of the militia was strengthened. One morning, eight local bandits came out, with three people in front carrying baskets pretending to be visiting relatives, and five people covering them from behind, attempting to go to the Jiepai area to arrest people and loot things. As soon as they reached outside the north gate of Jiepai, our militia battalion attacked them. The militiamen of Jiepai could no longer bear it and immediately took out their hidden guns, rushing up like tigers. The enemy scattered in all directions. After this fight, the guns in Jiepai were also revealed. Because this village was very close to the enemy, and the enemy would come to retaliate, the Kaocheng county district cadres immediately instructed the Jiepai militia and village cadres to be especially vigilant. Around the first watch of the night, the militiamen and village cadres were staying in the Beijie Hutong and had not yet gone to sleep. Suddenly, they heard a sound from the door of Wang Yisan's nearby courtyard. Wang Junshan, the chairman of the peasant association, looked out over the wall and saw several people entering Wang Yisan's house. He immediately led everyone to rush out and encountered the enemy in the middle of the hutong. The militiamen fired two shots, and the enemy retreated to the street and also opened fire with rifles. Comrade Wang Junshan rushed to the street and threw a grenade at the enemy, shouting loudly, "Everyone get up quickly, the plainclothes team (local bandits) are here to steal livestock and arrest people!" Seeing the situation was bad, the enemy ran away. The Zhangdiquan militia ran to reinforce them and chased the enemy for a while. After this fierce battle, the morale of the militia and the masses was very high. They were even more confident in defending their village, and their vigilance was also greatly improved. Not long after, also in the middle of the night, the armed first and fourth detachments of the puppet Cao County Third District and the puppet district headquarters, totaling more than a hundred people, had already rushed through the West Street and opened the doors of several households, attempting to arrest people and loot things. After our militia discovered this, they launched an attack in two shifts. Wang Junshan and several others rushed to Shidao Street and hid, firing in all directions. Militia squad leader Wang Xiuling and several others rushed to the west of the village, encircling the enemy's rear. With this inside and outside attack, the enemy panicked, seeing who could flee the fastest, and dropped two bayonets, two pairs of shoes, and five or six grenades. … These two villages soon formed a joint defense, and Xüquan also joined the joint defense. The three villages formed an iron wall, not only protecting the lives and property of the villagers, but also protecting the safety of many liberated villages behind them.

　　记菏考线两个村的对敌斗争
  　敌人就怕咱咱不怕敌人
    考城五区西北角的张堤圈和界牌两村，离庄砦敌据点只八、九里路，菏（泽）考（城）公路就从庄砦西门外穿过。这两村东西相离只一里路。很久年代以前，黄河在这一带发了一个岔子，人民就修堤防水，于是两道堤由西而东把两个村连接起来了。这两个村原是老解放区，自去秋沦为蒋占区后，七月有一天，张堤圈的群众正忙着做活，蒋匪四二九团一个连配合土顽窜到这村，强迫要麦子三千斤，群众没办法，东凑西凑弄了一千斤，忍着愤怒向敌人说好话才算了事。谁知敌人走时，一下子抓走了十二个妇女，走到西地里两个青年妇女就被强奸了，弄得满身是泥。这个村里的积极分子韩学立看到了，气得眼里冒火，他再也不能忍受，立即从水坑里扒出藏的一枝本地造枪，顺着大街向敌人开了火，敌人摸不清是怎回事就乱了群，拼命的向西逃窜，丢下了十个妇女。这样一打，张堤圈的枪公开了，也就从此揭开盖跟敌人拼。过了几天，积极分子韩学书、韩学立等领导全村群众，斗争了杨章雨等六家恶霸地主，清出浮财麦子一千八百斤、玉蜀黍和高粱一石五斗、蜀子七头、棉花五十斤，还有很多嫁妆和衣服。午前斗了午后就分，一直分到喝罢汤才完。分后有些群众恐慌，怕以后敌人来了不完，但多数群众说：“要想翻身就得霍上干！”第二天界牌村也开始了斗浮财，四个民兵均下地里站上岗，五家地主被控制在一个屋里，积极分子领导着群众把地主的浮财弄到街上，午后伪白茅镇长韩尚义，带着四十个人攻来了，大家一看敌人快来到，就把大部浮财嗡了，敌人进村后，看到满街是东西，狂暴的喊：“你们谁再找一件东西，我都枪毙你们！”并打伤村民王四。这时张堤圈韩学立跑到北堤上，向界牌打几枪，又跑到南堤上向界牌打几枪，随后，县大队的同志增援来了，一直打到界牌北门上，敌人逃窜了。从此以后，敌人对这两个村就特别注意了，这两个村的群众和敌人撕破了脸，土顽们一天向张堤圈进攻五六次，都被打退，始终没能进到村里。有一天有三个敌人扛着三捆高粱秆，里面包着枪，刚进到界牌北边，韩学立就转到界牌东北角了，“叭、叭，…………”几枪，敌人吓得屁滚尿流的窜了，村干和群众时刻警惕着敌人。在实际斗争中，群众深深感到武装斗争的重要，就又弄了几枝枪给民兵，民兵战斗力强了，一天早晨，土顽八人出来，头里三个人提着篮子假装走亲戚的，五个人在后边掩护，企图到界牌一带抓人抢东西，刚走到界牌北门外，我民兵营就打上了，界牌的民兵再也忍不住了，立即将藏着的枪拿出来，象猛虎一样扑上去，敌四分五散了，这样一打，界牌的枪也公开了。因这村离敌人很近，敌人会来报复，考城县区干部马上指示界牌民兵村干，要特别警惕，到晚上约一更天的时候，民兵村干在北街胡同里住，都还没有睡，忽然听得近院王义三的门响了一声，农会主任王均山从墙上向外一看，几个人正向王义三家里进，他立即领导大家向外冲，在胡同中间和敌人碰了头，民兵“叭，叭”打了两枪，敌人退到街上也打开排子枪，王均山同志冲到街上，向敌人打了一个手榴弹，就高喊：“大家快起来，便衣队（土顽）来拉牲口抓人咧！”敌人见势不好，就跑了，张堤圈的民兵跑步赶来增援，又把敌人追了一阵，在这次激烈的战斗胜利后，民兵和群众的斗争情绪非常高涨，坚持本村胜利信心更强，警惕性也更提高了。不久，也是一个深夜里，伪曹县三区武装一、四中队和伪区部共百多人，已经冲过了西街，并打开了几家老百姓的门子，企图抓人抢东西，我民兵发觉后，分两班出击，王均山等几个人冲到十导街藏下，向四面打枪，民兵班长王秀领等几个人冲到村西，包抄敌人的后路，这样里外一打，敌人炸了群，看谁窜的快，并掉下了两把刺刀、两双鞋、五六个手榴弹。……这两个村不久就组成了联防，徐圈也加入了联防。三个村组成了一道钢铁的墙壁，不仅保护了本村群众的生命财产，而且保护了后面许多解放村庄的安全。　（冀鲁豫分社）
