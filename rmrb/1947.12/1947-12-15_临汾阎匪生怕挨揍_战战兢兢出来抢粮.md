    [This dispatch from Taiyue, 13th] The Linfen Yan bandits' invasion to seize grain was carried out with trembling and utter disarray. On the evening of the 20th of last month, more than 30 members of the Yan bandits' township public office self-defense force went to Beixi Village in the Second District to seize grain. Afraid of our army's attacks, they didn't take the main road but instead wandered erratically through the fields. Upon arriving at the village, they didn't shout or knock on doors. Instead, they climbed over walls and stealthily groped around in the dark all night. After looting 17 households, they didn't speak along the way and weren't allowed to cough. Upon hearing a dog bark in Jia'ye Village, they were utterly terrified and fled in panic until they reached Zhoujiazhuang (three li from Linfen City) before resting. It is said that the enemies inside Linfen City haven't been able to eat a full meal for a long time. The market price of wheat has risen to 800,000 yuan in Jiang currency per shi, and sweet potatoes cost 1,000 yuan per jin. Although the market price is high, the masses have already been looted bare, and there is no grain for sale. The enemies can't even get sweet potatoes to eat. The Yan bandits plan to seize another 10,000 shi of grain. Our local armed forces are actively mobilizing to protect the people's grain. On the 29th of last month, they defeated more than 30 Yan bandits who were setting out from Zhaizhuang to seize grain. We captured eight enemies and seized two carts full of grain and vegetables, one horse, and one pig. We suffered no casualties.

    临汾阎匪生怕挨揍
    战战兢兢出来抢粮
    【本报太岳十三日电】临汾阎匪出犯抢粮，战战兢兢，狼狈不堪。上月二十日晚，阎匪乡公所自卫队三十余人，到二区北席村抢粮，他们惧怕我军打击，不走正路，从地里绕着乱走，到村中也不打抢，不叫门，从墙上爬进，拆开窗户小偷般黑摸一夜，抢了十七家后，沿途不说话，也不准咳嗽，在贾爷村听见狗咬，便吓得一塌糊涂。仓惶而逃，一直跑到周家庄（离临汾城三里）才休息下来。据说临汾城内的敌人很久就不能吃一顿饱饭，麦子每石市价涨到蒋币八十万元，红薯每斤一千元。市价虽高，群众早已被抢光，那有粮食出卖，敌人就连红薯也吃不上。阎匪计划再抢粮一万石，我地方武装正积极出动保卫人民粮食，上月二十九日，即将翟庄出发抢粮阎匪三十余人击溃，我俘敌八名，并缴获满载粮食蔬菜的大车两辆，马一匹，猪一口，我无伤亡。
