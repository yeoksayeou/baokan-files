[Taixing Dispatch, 1st of the month] In the week-long struggle to protect grain from November 13th to 19th, our local armed forces and vast militia in Northern Henan and Central Shanxi won successive victories, killing over 200 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers, including returning landlord captains and company commanders, capturing 242 alive, seizing 3 machine guns, 2 machine gun barrels, 1 small cannon, 1,550 rounds of ammunition, and 5 head of livestock. On the Northern Henan front: We also captured 10 strongholds, including Zhangmen west of Xinxiang, and Qianhou Lizhu in Tangyin. After the Yan Xishan bandit's "water inundation" to seize grain was crushed by us, they only dared to make small-scale disturbances. We have already proactively penetrated into their heartland. On the night of the 15th of this month, over 20 enemy "National Soldiers" and puppet township officials stationed in Shixiang Village, Tai'gu, secretly went to Xincun, 8 li from the city, to seize grain. On the way, they were ambushed by our district troops and militia pre-positioned in Xincun, and all the enemies were wiped out. A total of 5 were killed or wounded, 16 captured, and 1 machine gun, 1 small cannon, 12 rifles and carbines, and 250 rounds of ammunition were seized. On the 17th, over 30 Yan Xishan bandits from the 9th Column stationed in Menggao Village attempted to seize grain in Dabaicun and were again killed or wounded 5, captured 4 alive, and seized 1 machine gun, 4 rifles, and over 300 rounds of ammunition. The enemy was defeated and fled back to their stronghold. In both battles, we suffered no casualties. The traitors and bullies who advanced into our Tangyin in Northern Henan suffered severe blows from us in a week, with 270 killed or captured. Moreover, due to the liberation of more than ten villages and towns such as Qianhou Lizhu and Daxia Qingshan, the ferocity of their encroachment has been greatly reduced, and they are terrified of our attacks. The enemies in Anyang and Xinxiang also dare not go far to seize grain. In a week, our militia forces, under the slogan of "fight in and persist on the spot," used tactics such as encirclement, forced attack, and sabotage explosions, killing and capturing over 200 enemy traitors, bullies, and special agents. On the 17th of this month, the Yexian and Anyang militia jointly thoroughly destroyed the highway from Yangjiajing in the north to Beitian Village in the south, and launched a strong attack on the puppet township government in Beicun, rushing into the village and killing and capturing over 20 enemies, seizing 1 gun. On the night of the 14th, over 500 returning landlord bandits stationed in Zunguitun, Anyang, went to Yangqi Village, which we were holding behind enemy lines, to seize grain. The enemies said arrogantly, "There is no need to be afraid of seizing grain in Yangqi Village, there are only a dozen militiamen there." Before entering the village, they were attacked from all sides by our militia from several routes, shouting and killing in unison. The enemies were thrown into chaos and scattered in all directions. We killed or wounded 19, including a company commander, and captured over 20, seizing 4 rifles. The four district work teams and militia in Xinxiang have been operating in the areas of Yuanzhuang and Dongguo Village, 8 li from the city. In three days, they captured over 90 traitors, bullies, landlords, triad bosses, and black gunners, and distributed 3 million yuan of the traitor bully's property to the local masses in Dakuai Village, killing 8, including the Chenbao Township police squad leader, and seizing 3 guns and some ammunition. Over 40 members of the enemy's joint defense association attempted to encircle our work team operating in Dongguo Village, but were repelled by the powerful firepower of our machine guns. Some jumped into the ditch and took off their wet clothes, fleeing naked. Now the enemy in the city is very panicked, spreading rumors that the outskirts are full of Eighth Route Army soldiers.
