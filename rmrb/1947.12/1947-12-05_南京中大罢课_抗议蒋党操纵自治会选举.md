  　Protesting Chiang Party's Manipulation of Student Union Elections
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th】 Chiang's party's conspiracy to manipulate student union elections in various universities has been exposed. Students at Nanjing Central University are on strike to protest. According to an Associated Press report on the 28th: Central University is on strike, protesting that Kuomintang Youth Corps members hijacked ballot boxes, beat several election officials, and prevented the election from proceeding during the student union election. Striking students told the Associated Press reporter: The Chiang Party is using Kuomintang Youth Corps members in various universities to manipulate student unions, attempting to use this to obstruct future just student movements. After the violence occurred, the Chiang Party's Guidance Department ordered the student union to cease all activities. This unreasonable request has been solemnly rejected by the striking students.
