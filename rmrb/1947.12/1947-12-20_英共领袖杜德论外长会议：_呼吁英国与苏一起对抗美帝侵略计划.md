    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 14th: (Delayed) London - Harry Pollitt, a leader of the British Communist Party, published an article in the Daily Worker last month on the 25th, demanding that the Foreign Ministers' Meeting restore international cooperation on the basis of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. Pollitt pointed out: The Foreign Ministers' Meeting faces two paths. One path is that the four powers reach an agreement and work together to implement the wartime guarantees and promises regarding the future of Germany. This would mean jointly concluding a peace treaty with Germany, realizing a unified and democratic Germany within its current borders, eliminating militarism and Nazism, developing Germany's peaceful economy while destroying its war potential, fully paying reparations, and the four powers jointly managing the Ruhr economy. The other path is that the current "Anglo-American offensive" undermines the meeting, and, according to the "Truman Doctrine" and "Marshall Plan," conducts a reactionary separate peace. This would mean an open rupture in cooperation between Western countries and the Soviet Union, with Western countries separately organizing a puppet government in Western Germany to dismember Germany. The choice between these two paths involves not only the future of Germany but also the future of Europe and the relations between the great powers, as well as world peace. Pollitt also pointed out that the Ruhr issue is the central issue, stating: The Ruhr's steel production capacity is still 19.2 million tons per year. Compared to Britain's steel production of 13 million tons this year and France's production of 6 million tons, it is clear that it remains a powerful industrial center in Western Europe in terms of potential. The democratic future of Germany and the restoration of the European economy require the Ruhr to be taken out of the hands of the old German trust tycoons and Anglo-American monopolists and handed over to the four powers for joint management. Pollitt strongly stated: The plan of American monopoly capitalists to develop Western Germany and make it an industrial base for aggression against Western Europe particularly harms the interests of British industry. Pollitt also called for: Britain should resolutely stand with the Soviet Union to resist the American plan and strive for a peaceful solution agreed upon by the four powers. We must fight to restore international democratic cooperation. Only in this way can we ensure peace.

    英共领袖杜德论外长会议：
    呼吁英国与苏一起对抗美帝侵略计划
    【新华社陕北十四日电】伦敦讯：（迟到）英共领袖之一杜德，上月二十五日在工人日报发表专论，要求外长会议在雅尔塔与波茨顿协定基础上恢复国际合作。杜氏指出：外长会议面对着两个途径，一个途径是四强获致协议携手共进，实行战时对于德国前途的保证与诺言。这将意味着共同缔结对德和约，实现目前边界之统一的民主德国，清除军国主义与纳粹，发展德国和平经济而毁灭其战争潜力，充分支付赔偿以及四强共管鲁尔经济。另一个途径是目前的“英美攻势”破坏了会议，按照“杜鲁门主义”“马歇尔计划”的方针，进行反动的单独媾和。这将意味着西方诸国与苏联合作的公开破裂，西方各国单独的组织西部德国傀儡政府，以肢解德国。这两条途径的抉择不仅涉及德国的前途，而且涉及欧洲与列强关系以及世界和平的前途。杜德又指出鲁尔问题为中心问题称：鲁尔生产钢铁能力现仍为每年一千九百二十万吨，以与英国今年钢产量一千三百万吨及法国产量六百万吨相较，显然在潜力上依然是强大的西欧工业中心。德国民主的前途与欧洲经济的复原，要求将鲁尔由旧日德国托拉斯巨子与英美独占家手中取出交给四国共管。杜德力称：美国独占资本家发展西部德国，使其成为侵略西欧的工业基地底计划，特别打击了英国工业的利益。杜氏并呼吁：英国应坚决的与苏联站在一起，对抗美国计划，以争取四强一致协定的和平方案。我们必须为恢复国际民主合作而奋斗，只有这样才能确保和平。
