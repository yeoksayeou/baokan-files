　　Democratic Government Loans Millions
　　Helping Yongnian Disaster Victims Produce
　　[Reported by our Jinnan correspondent on the 28th] To support small-scale commercial production for disaster victims in Yongnian Chengguan, our democratic government recently allocated 10,154,500 yuan, combining relief efforts to distribute funds to various streets, lending to hardworking citizens engaged in production. The loan method is based on poor people's groups, separately mobilizing poor people to register their population, property, and occupation, requesting loan amounts and their intended use, following the mass line, and submitting them to the joint meeting of poor people's group leaders for review, discussion, and approval before lending. Guan Fuchang's family of four in North Street were bedridden with hunger and illness before the loan, and the whole family relied on relief grain. After receiving a loan of 10,000 yuan, they sell fried dough sticks, selling fifty or sixty a day, earning five or six hundred yuan, enough to buy four kilograms of rice, and can eat millet porridge and cabbage every day. Sister-in-law Fuchang said with a smile: "If the comrades hadn't come to save us, our family of four would have starved to death." Old man Ding Ruzhen, an old shopkeeper at the head of North Guan Bridge, said: "I used to have eight or nine brick houses and ran a shop. When the Japanese occupied the area, the business was ruined. When the Chiang army was here, all the houses were torn down, forcing me to live in this small shack where I can't even stand up. This time I borrowed 30,000 yuan to sell peanuts and cigarettes, and I can earn 1,400 yuan a day, enough to buy ten kilograms of rice. Three people use five kilograms, and there are still five kilograms left over." To prevent some people from "living from hand to mouth" and "relying solely on relief," the leadership specifically proposed to fully lead the masses to overcome the famine through production. On the 18th of this month, various streets held meetings to come up with ideas, and everyone put forward their personal production plans. Everyone spoke with great enthusiasm. Ma Du of East Street said: "I, alone, can spin four liang of thread from morning till night, earning 200 yuan in labor, enough to buy one and a half kilograms of rice. Drinking three meals of thin porridge a day is enough to support myself." Ma Shangde, who sells vinegar and oil, said: "My family of four borrowed 50,000 yuan to do this small business, and every day we can earn enough to eat millet, noodle soup, and yellow cornbread. My wife has become strong, and she can also spin and weave." Under this influence, the North Street Children's Corps voluntarily proposed a production competition. More than forty of them gather at school every night to sleep, and at dawn, they urge each other to get up and sell fruits and jujube cakes to the market and streets. After breakfast, they divide into shifts to hold rafts to pick up firewood outside the dike. Twelve-year-old Cao Fuchang earned fifteen kilograms of rice (equivalent to 2,000 yuan) by selling fruit for four days, and also picked up more than 200 kilograms of firewood. They are all working harder than the next.

　　民主政府贷款千万元
  　扶助永年灾民生产
    【本报冀南二十八日电】我民主政府为了支持永年城关灾民小本商业生产，日前特拨款一○、一五四、五○○元，结合救济工作，分别发放各街，贷给勤于生产的劳苦市民。贷款办法是以贫民组为主，分别号召贫民自报登记人口、财产、职业，要求款数及用途，走群众路线，交贫民组长联席会审查、评议、批准后，即行贷给。北街关福昌家四口人，贷款前饿病在床，一家人吃救济粮。贷款一万元后，卖油条，一天卖五六十根，赚五六百元，能买四斤米，每天能吃小米饭和白菜。福昌嫂笑着说：“要不是同志来救命，俺家四口人都得饿死。”北关桥头上老店家丁汝真老汉说：“俺以前有八九间砖房，开着个店，日本占领时，买卖毁了；蒋军在时，房都给拆平了，逼得俺住这一间站不起来的小窝铺。这次我贷款三万元，卖花生、烟卷，每天能赚千四百元，能买十斤米，三个人用五斤，还能余五斤。”领导上为了防止部分群众“吃了上顿不管下顿”和“单纯依靠救济”现象，特提出全力领导群众生产渡荒工作。本月十八日各街纷纷召开想办法会议，每人提出个人的生产计划，大家发言异常热烈。东家街马杜氏说：“我一口人，起早搭黑，能纺四两线子，挣手工二百元，能买斤半米。一天喝三顿糊糊，满能养活自己。”卖醋油的马尚德说：“我四口人，贷了五万元，作这个小卖买，每天能赚上小米、面汤、黄窝子吃。把俺老婆养壮了，她也能纺能织。”在这影响下，北街儿童团自动提出生产竞赛。他们四十来人每夜都集中在学校睡觉，黎明便互相督促着起来，去发果子、枣糕到市场和大街去卖，早饭后他们便分班撑着筏子到堤外去拾柴。十二岁的曹福昌四天卖果子赚了十五斤米（合二千元），还拾二百多斤柴，他们一个比一个干的有劲。
