　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 23rd. The stretcher team of × County, Fifth Sub-district, helps the peasants in the newly liberated areas to stand up. Eight hundred and forty-seven stretcher bearers from the third and fourth districts of the county, after receiving the task from the × Column, arrived at a village in southeast Yucheng to gather. At that time, the task had not yet arrived. All the team members went separately to the masses to publicize the counter-offensive situation, introduce the situation of the liberated areas and the personal emancipation. The masses in the village complained one after another, telling of the crimes of the township chief Shao Degui and the Bao chief Hou ××. Shao was a local landlord and great tyrant, with more than two qing of land and fifty steel guns. Hou had more than one qing of land. Both of them forcibly occupied the property of the masses when the enemy occupied the area. They also relied on their power to bully women and harm several lives. The masses hated them to the bone. This time, when our army arrived, they both fled with the enemy. After the stretcher bearers mobilized the masses, more than 400 people gathered automatically to distribute the property of the Shao and Hou families, distributing more than 7,000 jin of grain, more than 200 jin of cotton, 50,000 jin of firewood, 300 cotton clothes, more than 20 bolts of white cloth, two head of cattle, two pigs, and many other farm tools, wooden utensils, etc.

    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】五分区×县担架队，帮助新区农民翻身。该县三、四区担架队员八百四十七名，从×纵接受任务后，到达虞城东南一村庄集中，当时任务没有来到，全体队员便分头向群众宣传反攻形势，介绍解放区的情况和个人翻身的情况，该村群众便纷纷诉起苦来，诉说乡长邵德贵及保长侯××的罪行。邵是当地地主大恶霸，有土地两顷多及钢枪五十枝，侯有地一顷多，都是当敌人占领时强占群众的。他俩并仗势欺压民女，害过几条人命，群众恨入骨髓，这次我大军一到，他俩都随敌逃跑。群众经担架员发动，自动集合了四百余人，到邵侯两家分财，共分了粮食七千余斤、棉花二百余斤、烧柴五万斤、棉衣三百件、白布二十余匹、牛两头、猪两口，还有其他农具、木器等很多。
