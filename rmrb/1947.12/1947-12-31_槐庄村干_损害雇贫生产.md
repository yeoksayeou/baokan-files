　　Huai Zhuang Village Cadres
  　Damage Production by Hired Labor and Poor Peasants
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 29th dispatch] The Huai Zhuang village cadres in Qinshui have serious bureaucratic tendencies and disregard the winter production difficulties of hired laborers and poor peasants. The Huai Zhuang village cadres, after returning from a meeting in the district on November 20th, convened a meeting of all village system cadres on the 26th to arrange winter production. At the meeting, village chief Chang Huaizhi and political director Cui Yujie first conveyed the current situation, arranged production, and explained that this winter production would be led by hired laborers and poor peasants, with middle peasants participating, and landlords' production would be controlled, etc. Then, discussions were conducted by "Lü" (a historical administrative unit), and cadres were assigned to lead, stipulating a meeting reporting system. After the meeting, Farmers' Association Chairman Wang Yujie went to the 2nd Lü for a walk, and village chief Chang Huaizhi went to the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Lü. On December 5th, a reporting meeting was convened, totaling 27 spinning and weaving groups organized, with 167 participants. On the 14th, another urging meeting was convened, saying: "Go back and work hard!" On the 19th, three people from the loan work team went to the village to distribute loans and went to the hired laborers and poor peasants to understand the situation. Except for the 4th and 5th Lü which were better, the 1st Lü had four spinning and weaving groups, the 2nd Lü had four spinning and weaving groups, and the 3rd Lü had eight spinning and weaving groups. The transportation team was also organized, but it was completely a formality. There was neither spinning and weaving nor transportation. Only a few households were doing their own spinning and weaving. The hired laborers and poor peasants in the village were not only not mobilized, but were threatened by the landlords. For example, Li Xiaoheng, a hired laborer and poor peasant in the 3rd Lü, went to control the landlord Qin Liyuan, but was scolded loudly: "Do you know who I am? You still control me!" Xiaoheng was so scared that he dared not say another word. The difficulties of hired laborers and poor peasants in production were not solved at all. For example, the poor peasant Tian Baolei opened a small shop on the roadside, and could have kept a few more guests and livestock to earn a few more money, but because he didn't have the capital to buy grass, he didn't dare to keep more, so the daily earnings were only enough for daily food. The poor peasant Tian Luhui harvested three catties of cotton this autumn, and wanted to take it to be carded on December 20th, but could not borrow the money to do so. Blacksmith Guo Yinbao did not have the capital to buy iron, and could only work half a day a day. The village cadres did not see the difficulties of these people, and spent all day doing unimportant trivial things, abandoning the leadership of production. For example, Public Security Director Tian Zhichang often said: "If we don't lead, people still won't know how to produce?" After discovering these problems, the loan work team reorganized and led production.

　　槐庄村干
  　损害雇贫生产
    【本报太岳二十九日电】沁水槐庄村干部官僚主义严重，漠视雇贫农冬季生产困难。槐庄村干部，于十一月二十日由区上开会回来，二十六日召开了全村各系统干部会议，布置冬季生产，会中首由村长常怀智、政治主任崔玉杰传达了时事，布置生产，并说明今冬生产由雇贫领导，中农参加，管制地主生产等，然后以闾为单位进行讨论，同时干部也分工领导，规定了会议汇报制度。会后农会主席王玉杰到二闾走了一圈，村长常怀智到二、三、五闾走了一趟，在十二月五日就召开了汇报会议，共计组织了二十七个纺织组，参加人数一百六十七人，十四日又召开了一次督促会说：“回去好好干吧！”十九日贷款工作队三个人到该村发放贷款，深入雇贫了解了一下情况，除四、五闾较好外，一闾纺织组四个，二闾纺织组四个，三闾纺织组八个，运输队也组织起来了，但完全是形式，既没有纺织，又没有运输，只有几户各干各的纺织。该村雇贫不仅没有发动起来，反而受地主的威胁。如三闾雇贫农李小恒去管制地主秦立元，反被大骂说：“你知道我是什么人？你还管制我哩！”吓得小恒再也不敢哼气。雇贫农生产中的困难，根本没有解决。如贫农田保雷，在大路口上开一座小店，本能多留几个客人及牲口多赚几个钱，但因没有本钱买草不敢多留，所以每天赚的只够每天吃。贫农田禄会今秋收了三斤棉花，十二月二十日想拿去弹，但一直借不下钱不能去弹。铁匠郭银宝没有本钱买铁，一天只能做半天活，而村干部没有看见这些人的困难，成天干些不关重要的零碎事情，放弃对生产的领导，如公安主任田治昌常常说：“不领导人家还不知道生产？”贷款工作队发现这些问题后，才重新领导组织生产。
