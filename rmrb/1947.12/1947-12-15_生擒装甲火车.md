    Capturing an Armored Train Alive
    Ri Hong
    During our army's joint attack on the central core fortifications of Shijiazhuang, the Third Battalion of the "Meritorious Service Unit" engaged in a fierce struggle with an enemy armored train. After the "Meritorious Service Unit" advanced from the southeast and reached the station, the enemy retreated westward. We pursued and crossed the railway in victory. However, the company commander of the Seventh Company and two machine gun squads were left in the northeast corner to consolidate their position and contain the enemy. Suddenly, they heard the whistle of a locomotive. The Seventh Company commander guessed it must be an armored train, so he immediately climbed the ladder of a warehouse rack at the station and reached the top of a two-story foreign-style building. Sure enough, he saw a column of white smoke and an armored train rushing straight towards our position from the north like a giant snake. The atmosphere immediately became tense. The Seventh Company commander didn't have time to climb down the ladder, so he jumped directly from the roof and urgently ordered the liaison officer to quickly recall the Third Platoon to intercept the train. He himself grabbed a machine gun and climbed back onto the roof, standing there and firing fiercely at the oncoming locomotive. At the same time, Bai Fengxi of the machine gun squad set up his machine gun and lay down on the track, firing head-on at the enemy train. In addition, with the coordination of the battalion headquarters and the machine guns of the Eighth and Ninth Companies, armor-piercing rounds rained down on the locomotive from three sides. In an instant, the train stopped abruptly, panting heavily.
    At this moment, the Third Platoon Leader personally led the Ninth Squad and rushed over, hiding in the red wall next to the road. They gave the train another barrage of explosive grenades. The Seventh Company commander said, "The train is just spewing white smoke and dripping urine (leaking water), it won't move anymore." The armored train's boiler had been damaged. Just then, the enemy machine guns and cannons on the train opened fire on our position. The Seventh Company commander decided to charge the train. Young soldier Huang Xingui was the first to brave the enemy machine gun fire and leap over the station's barbed wire, climbing onto the locomotive. War hero Xu JinKui and the company commander also successively rushed into the carriages. The sound of grenades and explosions enveloped the train. The entire enemy company was compressed into one carriage, which was precisely where the enemy company commander was located. They relied on the armored steel plates of the carriage to continue firing at us, refusing to surrender. Thereupon, Zhang Guichen, the Third Battalion Commander, who was personally directing the battle, immediately ordered the Ninth Company to prepare to blow up the carriage. Soldier Wang Benxian approached the carriage and completed the preparations. A deafening "boom" was heard, and amidst the smoke, Wang Benxian grabbed a gun hole on the carriage and jumped up to disarm the enemy. However, the enemy pushed a grenade out of the gun hole. He quickly let go, jumped off the train, and lay down, avoiding injury.
    Deputy Political Instructor Hu said to Wang, "Blow it up again." Wang Benxian, braving the enemy machine gun and grenade fire, calmly made preparations for the second time. Following another, even more violent explosion, the earth shook and the sky trembled. The carriage tilted, falling to the side of the road, with the rails standing straight up. Wang Benxian took the lead, followed by all the soldiers of the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Companies who rushed forward, capturing all the enemy soldiers who had not been killed in the explosion alive. An enemy tank on the train that had not been used in time also became a gift to us.

    生擒装甲火车
    日红
    在我军会攻石庄市中心区核心工事时，立功部三营与敌铁甲列车发生一场激烈的搏斗。立功部由东南突进车站后，敌向路西退却，我乘胜追越铁路。但在东北角仍留下七连连长及两个机枪班巩固阵地以箝制敌人。忽然听见车头汽笛的吼叫，七连连长猜想一定是铁甲列车来啦，便马上攀上车站货架梯子，爬到两丈多高的洋房顶，果见白烟滚滚，一列装甲火车风驰电掣，象巨蛇一样从北直向我阵地驶来，空气立刻紧张起来。七连长来不及从梯子上下来，就直从房顶上涌身跳下，急令通讯员速调三排转回阻击，他自己就抓起一挺机枪，又翻上房顶，立着向冲过来的车头猛射，同时机枪班的白凤喜也架起机枪卧在铁轨上，迎头向敌车射击。此外加上营部及八、九连机枪的配合，穿甲弹象骤雨般从三面喷向车头，刹那间，列车猛然停止了，粗重的喘着气。
    此时正好三排长亲自带领九班也赶来，隐在路旁的红墙里边，又给列车一顿猛烈的炸药手榴弹，七连长说：“列车只会冒白烟滴搭尿（漏水），不动弹啦”。装甲火车的水锅被打坏了。正在这时，列车上的敌机枪和钢炮向我阵地开火了，七连长决心向列车冲锋，年轻战士黄新贵首先冒着敌机枪弹一跃跳过了车站铁丝网攀上了火车头，功臣续金魁和连长等也相继冲进车箱，手榴弹声和爆炸的烟绕着列车冲腾起来，敌人一个连全部被压缩在一个车箱里，这个车箱正是敌连长的所在地，他们凭借车箱的装甲钢板继续向我射击，拒绝投降。于是，亲临指挥的三营营长张贵臣马上命令九连准备，把这个车箱炸掉，战士王本现爬近车箱，做完了准备工作。只听见“轰”然一声，随着烟幕，王本现一手攀住车箱上的枪眼，就跳上去缴枪，敌人却从枪眼往外塞出一个手榴弹，他赶快松手，跳下车来卧倒，没有受伤。
    胡副政指对王说：“再炸它”。王本现冒着敌机枪手榴弹火力沉着的又做好第二次准备工作。接着比刚才更猛烈一声轰响，天震地动，车箱一歪，倒在路旁，铁轨直竖起来，王本现一马当先，随后七、八、九连全体战士一涌上去，将没炸死的敌人全体活捉了，一辆放在列车上没来得及用的敌坦克也成了送给我们的礼物。
