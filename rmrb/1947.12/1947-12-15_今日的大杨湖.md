Today's Dayang Lake

Dayang Lake, this is where Chiang Kai-shek's army commander Zhao Xitian was captured alive by General Liu Bocheng. However, at that time, the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire did not completely destroy the landlord feudal forces, allowing Chiang Kai-shek and the local landlords to launch a joint offensive against the peasants later. In order to control the Heze-Kaifeng road, the enemy set up a stronghold at Shuiniu Li, eight miles north of Dayang Lake. Subsequently, the fleeing landlords "Dong Erbianshi," "Zhou Erxun," "Yang Dade," and "Yang Erduantui" all returned, carrying out land and grain seizures and murdering villagers.

Of the 220 households in Dayang Lake, more than 100 were military families, and it used to be an anti-Japanese stronghold. This spring, land reform was carried out. When the review began, the village's most heinous landlord, Du Xinbao, and his father colluded with stubborn bandits and, on the 24th day of the seventh lunar month, captured more than 50 villagers and military family members. He and the other eight landlords moved their property to the Chiang-occupied area. Subsequently, enemy plainclothes teams constantly came out to capture people and loot grain, making it impossible for the masses to live, and they fled to the base areas. Of the total population of 1,224 in Dayang Lake, almost all except the 83 landlord family members who fled to the Chiang-occupied areas with Du Huitian, Du Xinbao, and others, fled to the base areas.

Now, only a handful of nine people remain in Dayang Lake, all of whom are old men and women. Among the masses captured by the enemy, two military family members were killed, two are missing, and nine are imprisoned by the enemy in the stronghold. The masses who fled to our base areas said sadly to our cadres, "We were too complacent about the landlords in the past."

Even so, the fighting spirit of the peasants in Dayang Lake has not been completely crushed. They collectively asked the democratic government to issue guns to fight against Chiang's army and the reactionary landlords. Our government responded to their request, and the Heze Gengsheng District Third Joint Defense Team was thus organized. They and other brother joint defense teams operate around the enemy strongholds. They wear plain clothes, and the reactionary armed forces of the landlord "Dong Erbianshi" also wear plain clothes. They almost meet and open fire every day. Local people say, "Chiang Kai-shek's army can't defeat our regular army, and the enemy's plainclothes team can't stand up to our people's armed forces." On the 29th day of the ninth lunar month, the Third Joint Defense Team, in coordination with local troops, captured seven enemy plainclothes team members, including deputy Wang Keming, alive in Baizhai, and killed or wounded six enemies. During the battle, a member of the Dayang Lake Joint Defense Team, nicknamed Yao, rushed up and hugged an enemy tightly. They are avenging the masses in their village and want to recapture their hometown from the enemy.

    今日的大杨湖
    一山·景还
    大杨湖，这就是蒋匪军师长赵锡田被刘伯承将军活捉的地方，但当时人民解放军的炮火并没有完全把地主封建势力摧毁，使蒋匪与当地地主以后能向农民进行了联合进攻。敌人为了控制菏考路，在大杨湖北八里的水牛李按上了据点，接着逃亡地主“董二扁食”“周二训”“杨大得”“杨二短腿”都回来了，对农民进行倒地倒粮，杀害村民。
    大杨湖二百廿户人家，就有一百多家军属，过去曾是一座抗日堡垒。今年春天进行了土地改革，当进入复查时，这村罪大恶极的地主杜心保及其父与顽匪勾结，于阴历七月二十四日，抓去这村群众与军属五十余人，他即同其余八家地主搬运财物到蒋占区去。接着，敌人便衣队不断出来抓人与抢粮，群众无法生活，纷纷逃到根据地来。大杨湖共一千二百二十四口人，除随杜惠田、杜心保等跑到蒋占区的八十三口地主家外，几乎全部都逃来了根据地。
    现在大杨湖只剩了有数的九口人，都是老头和老太婆。其余被敌捉去的群众中，两个军属被杀了，两个人失踪了，还有九个人被敌人监禁在据点内。逃到我根据地来的群众，他们见到我干部就沉痛的说：“我们过去对地主太麻痹了。”
    虽说如此，大杨湖的农民们的斗志并没有完全被打下去，集体向民主政府要求发枪，要去与蒋军和反动地主打仗。我政府答复了他们的要求，菏泽更生区第三联防队，就是这样组织起来了，他们同其他弟兄联防队，一同活动到敌据点周围，他们穿着便衣，地主“董二扁食”的反动武装也穿便衣，差不多每天都要碰头开火，当地群众说：“蒋匪军打不过我们的正规军，敌人便衣队也顶不住我们的人民武装。”阴历九月二十九日，第三联防队配合地方部队，在白寨活捉了敌便衣队副王克明等七名，毙伤敌六名，战斗时大杨湖联防队有个队员小名叫要的，上去死抱住一个敌人。他们在为本村群众报仇，要把自己的家乡从敌人手中夺回来。
