    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government has decided to fully accept the "Outline Land Law of China" promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on October 10th as the land law of the Border Region. In order to effectively implement this land law, the following proclamation is hereby issued:

    "The 'Outline Land Law of China' promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China this year (1947) on October 10th conforms to the needs of completing the land revolution, establishing the people's political power, and realizing a New Democratic New China. It has been warmly embraced by the broad masses of people across the country and, of course, is fully applicable to the land reform in our Border Region. Now, it is decided by this government:

    1. To fully accept the 'Outline Land Law of China' as the land law of this Border Region, resolutely support it, and earnestly implement it.

    2. In order to ensure that the implementation of the 'Outline Land Law of China' is suitable for the actual conditions of this Border Region, in addition to the 'Supplementary Measures for the Implementation of the Outline Land Law of China in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region' already formulated by this government and to be promulgated separately, each administrative region may also formulate specific implementation measures suitable for the actual conditions of each region, but must not violate the principles of the 'Outline Land Law of China' and the supplementary measures of this government, as well as the demands and interests of the peasant masses; and must be approved by this government.

    3. All previous laws, regulations, and rules issued by this government and its subordinate governments that conflict with the 'Outline Land Law of China' and the supplementary measures of this government are hereby repealed.

    4. Any individual, group, or organization that violates, undermines, or resists the 'Outline Land Law of China' and the supplementary regulations of this government, and engages in activities that obstruct the peasant movement, sabotage land reform, and infringe upon the people's democratic rights; or, in the implementation of the 'Outline Land Law of China,' uses their position to engage in corruption, practice favoritism, act against the rules to protect landlords and rich peasants, oppose farm laborers, poor peasants, and rural workers, cheaply buy, encroach upon, or steal the fruits of struggle, will be handed over to the People's Court and severely punished according to law; in particular, those who use violence to resist or sabotage will be resolutely suppressed and eliminated.

    5. Heads of government organs at all levels (including public enterprises) who deliberately condone or shield the aforementioned criminal acts of staff members of their respective organs and subordinate lower-level organs shall also be subject to legal sanctions."
