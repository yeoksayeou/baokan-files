　　[This dispatch from Taiyue, dated the 29th of this month] On the eve of the New Year, the Kuomintang-Yan Xishan bandit troops' controlled areas in Linfen, Pingyao, and Jiexiu are displaying increasing panic and disarray. The Kuomintang currency is plummeting, prices are skyrocketing, wheat has risen to over one million yuan per stone, flour is three hundred thousand yuan per bag, corn is three thousand two hundred yuan per jin, pork is twenty-four thousand yuan per jin, oil is thirty-two thousand yuan per jin, and salt is five thousand yuan per jin. The Linfen bandit chiefs, Feng Yingzhou and Liang Peihuang, have dispatched "inspection teams" to arrest merchants and civilians en masse, forcibly lowering prices. At the train station alone, forty large and small vendors were arrested, but the rising trend continues unchecked. The soaring prices are rising in a straight line because the People's Liberation Army is constantly besieging and attacking the bandit troops in the area. The citizens all anticipate the imminent collapse of the bandit troops. As soon as they get Kuomintang currency, they buy goods, and the market is flooded with paper money. The Kuomintang-Yan Xishan bandit troops in Linfen are in extreme panic. They are forcing merchants, civilians and apprentices to go outside the city to increase fortifications, and have razed villages such as Yangjiazhuang and Lushizhuang in the north of the city, attempting to eliminate the People's Liberation Army's support for the attack, forcing the people to be displaced in hunger and cold. In the Yan Xishan bandit controlled areas of Pingyao and Jiexiu, in order to seize grain, they are implementing the "guillotine policy", the "clubbing policy", and the "axe policy". In Jiguo Village, Pingyao, more than forty farmers, including Hei'er, were killed by Yan Xishan's "Struggle Corps". Thousands of people have fled to the liberated areas to seek refuge. The people in the Yan Xishan bandit controlled areas have four hopes: first, that the People's Liberation Army will come to rescue them; second, that Yan Xishan will die soon; third, that the "Rural Teams" and "Struggle Corps" will be eliminated soon; and fourth, that it will get dark (Yan Xishan bandits dare not go out when it is dark).

　　临汾平遥匪军更加恐慌混乱
    【本报太岳二十九日电】新年前夕的临汾、平遥、介休蒋阎匪军统治区，更呈恐慌混乱，蒋币暴跌，物价狂涨，小麦每石已涨至百余万元，白面每袋三十万元，玉黍蜀每一斤三千二百元，猪肉每斤两万四千元、油每斤三万二千元、盐每斤五千元，临汾匪首丰瀛洲、梁培璜曾派出“稽查队”大肆逮捕商民，强制物价下跌，仅在火车站上即捉大小商贩四十人，但涨势仍如脱羁之马。物价之狂跃奔腾直线上升，原因系因人民解放军不断对该地匪军围困打击，市民都预感匪军即快垮台，蒋币一到手就购买货物，票子充斥市面。临汾蒋阎匪军已恐慌到极点，强迫商民学徒出城增修工事，已将城北杨家庄芦师庄等村庄平毁，企图扫除人民解放军进攻依托，迫使人民在饥寒中流离失所。平、介阎匪抢粮中施行：“铡刀政策”、“乱棍政策”、“斧头政策”，平遥冀郭一村即被阎匪“奋斗团”杀死农民黑儿等四十余人，现有千余人逃来解放区避难。阎匪统治区人民有四盼：一盼人民解放军去救他们，二盼阎锡山早死，三盼“乡村”、“奋斗团”早被消灭，四盼天黑（天黑时，阎匪可不敢外出活动）。
