Shanghe Fifth District Stretcher Team

    Well-Organized, Highly Disciplined

    The Shanghe Fifth District stretcher team has the following characteristics: First, it has a strict organization. Fifty stretchers are manned by a total of 220 civilian laborers, 8 militiamen, 2 supply personnel, 5 cooks, 5 communication personnel, 1 doctor, and 1 civilian cadre. There is a central team headquarters, divided into three detachments and six squads. Each stretcher forms a group, totaling fifty groups. Each squad has a farmers' association organization, with the chairman and committee members all democratically elected. The committee members carry stretchers just like everyone else. Second, there is a meeting and reporting system. Each stretcher group holds a daily self-criticism meeting, and wartime meetings are held anytime, anywhere. After completing a task, a major review meeting is held. Each squad holds a group leader joint meeting every five days; the central team and detachments hold a reporting meeting every ten days. The farmers' association is active, the Party organization is sound, and a unified Party leadership is implemented. Third, there are bulletin boards and merit books. The squad registers merits every five days. The squad has a propaganda department, consisting of five to seven people, who also serve as merit recording committee members. In such a healthy environment, the team members' morale is very high, and they give the masses a good impression. Zhang Xiumei of Hubuzhai in the Fifth District voluntarily requested to serve as a stretcher-bearer, saying, "My son joined Liu Deng's army and went south, performing meritorious service for the people. This time I'm a stretcher-bearer to strive for meritorious service and compete with my son." He led his village's stretcher group, and when stationed in Yangcun, they helped the masses harvest corn, grind flour, plaster houses, collect firewood, and carry water. When they left, the masses were reluctant to part with them and saw them off outside the village. The stretcher group from Chaihezhai proposed conditions for earning merit and challenged the Second Stretcher Team (Shanghe Sixth District). The conditions are: 1. When stationed, abide by local customs, help the masses chop grass, collect firewood, pick vegetables, grind flour, do propaganda, and use the feedback from the villagers as a standard for earning merit; 2. Regardless of whether marching day or night, listen to commands, do not fall behind, do not crowd, and do not make noise; 3. Bravely advance after receiving a task and resolutely complete it, carry the wounded steadily and gently, provide water and food to the wounded, and those who receive the support of the wounded will be used as one of the criteria for evaluating merit.

    尚和五区担架队
    组织严密纪律良好
    尚和五区担架队，有如下特点：一、有严密的组织。五十付担架共民工二百廿名、民兵八名、供给员二名、炊事员五名、通信员五名、医生一名、民干一名，设有中队部，下分三个分队、六个小队，每付担架为一组，共五十组，每小队皆有农会组织，主任和各委员都是民选的，委员和大家一样抬担架；二、会议汇报制度。每一付担架每天开一次生活检讨会，战时随时随地召开，完成一段任务后，开大检讨会。各小队每五天召开一次组长联席会；中队与分队十天召开一次汇报会。农会活跃，党的组织建全，并实行了党的一元化领导。三、有门板报和记功簿。小队五天登记一次功劳，小队设有宣传部，五人至七人组成，并兼记功委员。在这样健全的生活下，队员们情绪十分饱满，并给群众以良好的印象。五区户部砦的张秀梅，自动要求出担架，他说：“我儿子随刘邓大军南下，为人民立了功，我这次出担架争取立功，与儿子比赛。”他领着他村担架组，在杨村住时，给群众收打玉蜀黍、推磨、泥房子、拾柴、担水，临走时，群众对他们恋恋不舍，送出村外。拆合砦的担架组，提出了立功条件，和担架二中队（尚和六区）挑战，条件是：一、在驻地时，遵守当地群众风俗习惯，帮助群众铡草、拾柴、采菜、推磨、作宣传，根据驻村群众反映做立功标准；二、不管白天黑夜行军时，听指挥、不掉队、不拥挤、不喧哗；三、接了任务勇敢前进，坚决完成任务，抬伤号要稳抬、轻放，给伤号端水送饭，得到伤号拥护者，作为评功标准之一。
