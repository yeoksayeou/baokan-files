	"Cultivating Three, Surplus One" Cannot Be Generalized
	Investigation of Three Villages in the Second District of Yuanchao
	Poor Peasants Average One Month of Grain Shortage
	[This Newspaper Reports] In the past year, the leadership in production in the Second District of Yuanchao has lacked a clear class line. It was only spoken of increasing production, but who increased production? Who achieved "cultivating three, surplus one"? The thinking was vague. After this investigation, in the three villages of Beilizhuang, Ximengcun, and Xibeizhangji, there were 136 poor peasants cultivating a total of 508.8 mu of land, averaging 3.74 mu per person. The total annual harvest was equivalent to 26,608.5 jin of rice, averaging slightly more than 195 jin per person. From October of this year to the end of April next year, based on the minimum living standard of one jin of millet per person per day, there is still a one-month grain shortage after paying public grain. This proves that the conclusion of "cultivating three, surplus one" cannot be obtained by averaging across the entire village. (Jinan Daily)

    耕三余一不能笼统
    元朝二区三村调查
    贫农平均缺粮一月
    【本报讯】元朝二区一年来的生产，在领导上阶级路线是不明确的，光说增产、谁增产？谁达到“耕三余一”？在思想上是模糊的。经过这次调查，北李庄、西孟村、西北张集三个村，贫农一百三十六人，共耕种地五百零八亩八分，每人平均地三亩七分四。全年收成共折米二万六千六百零八斤半，每人平均一百九十五斤强。从今年十月至明年四月底，每人每天，以最低生活水平一斤小米算，除交公粮，尚缺一个月的口粮。从此证明，耕三余一结论，是不能全村平均笼统得出的。  （冀南日报）
