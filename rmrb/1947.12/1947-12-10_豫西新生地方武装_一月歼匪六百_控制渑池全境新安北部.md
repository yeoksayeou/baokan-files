　　Taiyue Telegram from our newspaper on the 6th of this month: The new local armed forces in western Henan have achieved victory in suppressing bandits, eliminating more than 600 bandits in one month and stabilizing revolutionary order. At the beginning of November, when Chiang's bandits transferred reinforcements from northern Shaanxi and invaded eastward from Tongguan in an attempt to open the Longhai Railway, the local remnant bandits and the "Miaodao Society" and other special agent organizations also actively cooperated. However, they were severely cracked down upon by our local armed forces in a series of suppressions. First, at dawn on November 19, a unit of the local armed corps in western Henan, in coordination with local guerrillas, surrounded the notorious bandit gangs of Ye Lao Lu and Wang Dian Ge from Yiyang, numbering more than 500, in the Wangyuegou and Niegou areas, 50 miles west of Yiyang. After three hours of fighting, they were completely defeated, with nearly 200 bandits killed, wounded, and captured. The vast areas of Yuquan, Hancheng, and Sanxiang on the north bank of the Luohe River were thus stabilized. Another unit of our local armed corps also defeated the Wang Mingjiang bandit gang in the Gongqianzhen area (70 miles southeast of Shanxian) on the 17th, killing and capturing more than 20 bandits. The remaining bandits fled towards Shanxian. All the bandits in the northern parts of Xin'an and Mianchi were also largely eliminated by our forces. Only a small number of remnant bandits fled to the Tiehmen line in Xin'an, and our army immediately pursued them to Tiehmen. Chiang Kai-shek's Mianchi County Magistrate Wang Kaiki and his bandit troops, numbering several hundred, infiltrated the Shangxia Hongchang area, 10 miles northwest of Tiehmen, on the 19th, but were immediately intercepted by us. They quickly turned around and fled, and our army closely pursued them to the Black Tiger Bridge, 5 miles west of Tiehmen, where they were completely annihilated, and more than 200 bandits were captured. On the 21st, the Liu Songnian bandit gang, with more than 100 members, combined with several hundred members of the "Miaodao Society" and infiltrated Caocun and Zhifang (50 miles northwest of Xin'an). They were also surrounded and annihilated the next day, and more than 200 were captured alive.
　　After suffering severe blows from our forces, the bandit chiefs Qin Huaiyu, Chiang Kai-shek's eleventh district commissioner, Wang Kaiki, the magistrate of Mianchi County, Guo Zhi, the magistrate of Xin'an County, and Liu Hansan and Deng Yuru held an emergency meeting in Xin'an on the 25th, attempting to re-invade northern Xin'an and Mianchi. However, on the 27th, Zhang Bohua and Deng Yuru's bandit troops, numbering more than 400, combined with several hundred members of the "Miaodao Society," were repelled as soon as they advanced to Nianping, with 24 bandits killed and wounded. On the 28th, a unit of our army took the initiative to encircle and annihilate the 4th Brigade of the Xin'an Self-Defense Force (only more than 20 people), which had fled to Huangbailing, completely annihilating them and capturing 19 bandits, including the brigade commander and deputy brigade commander Wang Baoyi and Wang Xianying, and killing 2 bandits. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Xin'an and Mianchi counties have been compressed by our forces into a small area along the Tiehmen line in Xin'an and near Hengshui. The entire territory of Mianchi and the vast area of northern Xin'an are still under our control, and the encirclement and annihilation of the remaining bandits is continuing.
