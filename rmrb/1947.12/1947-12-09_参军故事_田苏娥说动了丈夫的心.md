　　Enlistment Story
  　Tian Sue'e Persuades Her Husband
    Ji Lu Yu Branch
    Tian Sue'e from Zhang Yi Village in the Sixth District of Puyang, after several enlistment mobilization meetings, expressed her attitude at a women's meeting, wanting to play a model role in encouraging her husband to join the army. On the 15th evening, she coaxed the children to sleep, and after waiting for a while, her husband, Chang Xinxi, finally returned from a meeting outside. "Why did the meeting last until this hour!" Sue'e asked. "Mobilizing for enlistment, it took a long time"; Chang Xinxi seemed impatient. Sue'e continued to ask, "How many of your militiamen are willing to go?" Xinxi said, "We discussed it for a long time, and everyone said that old Jiang should be defeated and we should join the army, but no one said they would go!" "Are you willing to go?" Sue'e pressed him. "In principle, I should go, but I just don't want to fight!" Hearing Xinxi's words, Tian Sue'e explained the reasoning that fighting was forced by old Jiang, and said, "Think about those two years, when we went to Shanxi to escape famine, we were hungry and cold all day long, and the children cried all day long. Now we have been allocated nine mu of land, and we have food and clothing. Can we live a good life if we don't kill old Jiang? ......" "I also know this, but now that we just have a bowl of rice, I still want to have a couple of years of family reunion!" "I think so too, but can we rest assured if we don't defeat old Jiang?" When we escaped famine to Shanxi, you were forced to become a soldier for Yan Xishan, and you even asked me to marry someone else. Didn't you talk about family reunion then!" As she spoke, she straightened the quilt, preparing to sleep. Chang Xinxi was thinking, and then fell asleep. In the quilt, she started murmuring again: "Have you ever had this quilt in the past two years? When we escaped famine to Shanxi, the three of us shared a tattered bed sheet! When Jiang's Fifth Army was here, you were so scared that you hid in the fields all day long, did you ever have a peaceful sleep? Now the house doesn't leak anymore, don't forget the pain once the wound is healed! ......" All night, Tian Sue'e kept talking, and Chang Xinxi kept thinking. At dawn, Chang Xinxi put on his clothes and said, "I am determined to sign up." "I'm just afraid you don't have the guts!" Tian Sue'e said with a smile. After breakfast, six people had already signed up at the militia meeting. Xinxi lowered his head, his face flushed, his heart pounding, unable to make up his mind. "Sign up, I don't want to leave home; don't sign up, I feel unreasonable and ashamed! If we can't avenge and eliminate Jiang, we will never have a good life; my wife said those things again! ......" After the meeting, Xinxi still stood there thinking blankly, and reluctantly walked home slowly, thinking, "I'll talk about it at the next meeting." Tian Sue'e saw him come back with a sad face, but deliberately said, "I heard you signed up?!" Xinxi blushed and said shyly, "The meeting was over before I could sign up!" "Humph, if I were a man, I would have signed up at the first meeting. Seeing that old Jiang is about to be finished, it will be too late if we don't strike a blow now! In the future, I will also take a train and take a trip to the south! ......" "Do you think I won't go? I didn't get a chance this morning, I will definitely sign up this afternoon." "Don't say any more, just wait to wear new socks and new shoes. Don't worry about the work at home, I will take care of the children. Let's make some dumplings." Tian Sue'e said, half mocking, half comforting.
    On the morning of the 19th, at the enlistment meeting in front of the Tiefo Temple, more than a thousand men, women, and children from the whole village were present. Tian Sue'e and Chang Xinxi walked hand in hand from the crowd to the stage, and the audience immediately burst into warm applause. Tian Sue'e said with a smile, "In order to defeat old Jiang and live a good life, I am sending my husband to join the army, and I don't need everyone to take care of the work at home." Chang Xinxi also raised his voice and said, "I am determined to defeat old Jiang, the scoundrel, and I guarantee I won't desert. I won't go home until I kill old Jiang." In the deafening slogans, Chang Xinxi walked to the new recruits' reception tent, and Tian Sue'e walked to the new military dependents' reception tent.

　　参军故事
  　田苏娥说动了丈夫的心
    冀鲁豫分社
    濮阳六区张仪村田苏娥，经过几次动员参军会后，便在一次妇女会议上表明了态度，要起模范作用，动员丈夫去参军。十五日晚上，她哄小孩睡下了，等了一会，她丈夫常心喜才由外面开会回来，“怎么到这时候才开完会！”苏娥问。“动员参军啦，弄了半天”；常心喜带着不耐烦的样子。苏娥接着往下问：“你们民兵有几个愿意去？”心喜说：“讨论了半天，都说老蒋应该打，应该参军，可是谁也没说去！”“你愿意去不？”苏娥追着问。“按理应该去，就是不愿意打仗！”田苏娥听了心喜这话，把打仗是老蒋逼的道理说了一遍，又说道：“你想想那二年，咱上山西逃荒成天受饥挨饿，小孩成天哭，现时分了九亩地，有吃有穿了，不杀死老蒋咱能不能过好日子？………”“我也知道这个道理，可是刚端上饭碗，还愿意团团圆圆过二年哩！”“我也是这样想，可是不打倒老蒋能放心不？”上山西逃荒时，逼的你非当阎锡山兵不行，还叫我再走一家，那时你也不说团圆啦！”她一面说，一面将被子伸好，准备要睡了。常心喜一面思想着，就睡下了。在被窝里，她就又咕噜起来：“前二年你盖过这被子吗？山西逃荒时咱三口伙盖一个破铺底！蒋五军在这时，吓的你成天去地里躲，睡过安生觉没有？这时房子也不透风啦，可不要好了疮疤忘了痛呀！………”一夜，田苏娥不断的说，常心喜不断的想。天明了，常心喜一面穿衣，一面说：“我是一定要报名。”“就怕你没胆！”田苏娥笑着又追了一句。早饭后，民兵会上已有六个报了名。心喜低着头，脸上直发烧，心里跳动着，拿不定主意，“报名吧，不愿离家；不报名，又觉没理，丢人！不能报仇灭蒋，永远过不好日子；老婆又说了那些话！……”散会了，心喜还呆着脸想着，不得已也慢慢走回家去，心想：“下次开会再说吧”。田苏娥见他愁眉苦脸的回来，但却故意的说：“听说你报名了？！”心喜红了脸，羞怯怯的说：“没等上我报，就散会啦！”“哼，我要是男子汉，头一次开会就报上啦。眼看老蒋快完了，再不打一锤就晚了！将来也坐坐火车，上南边转一圈！……”“你知道我不去吗？上午没等上，下午一定报”，“别说啦，等着穿新袜子新鞋吧，家里活请放心啦，小孩由我照管。咱包顿饺子吃吧。”田苏娥一面讥讽，一面安慰的说着。
    十九日上午，铁佛寺庙前参军大会的会场上，全村一千多男女老少都到齐了，田苏娥和常心喜手拉手的从人群中走到台子上，全场马上响起一阵热烈的掌声，田苏娥笑着说道：“为的打倒老蒋过好日子，我送丈夫参军，家里活我也不用大家照顾。”常心喜也扬起嗓子说：“我一心去打老蒋这个孬孙，保险不开小差，打不死老蒋不回家。”在震天的口号声中，常心喜走到新战士招待棚里，田苏娥走到新军属招待棚里。
