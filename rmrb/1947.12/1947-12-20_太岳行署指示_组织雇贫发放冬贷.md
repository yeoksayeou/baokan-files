Taiyue Administrative Office Directive
Organize and Employ the Poor to Issue Winter Loans
Review the Past to Clarify the Direction
Distribute 70,000,000 Yuan in Winter Loans

[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 18th] The Taiyue Administrative Office allocated 70,000,000 Yuan for winter production loans. On the 10th of this month, the Administrative Office held a meeting in its residence with the county heads and bank managers from the Second and Fourth Special Districts to study how to fully loan the 70,000,000 Yuan to the impoverished masses in areas with poor harvests, and to organize production to achieve prosperity. The discussions at the meeting were enthusiastic. First, the shortcomings of past loan work were strictly examined. The main problem was a blurred mass perspective, failing to follow the route of employing and supporting the poor. More loans were given to cadres, cooperatives, and those with middle-peasant and above status. For example, the director of the Armed Forces Committee of a certain village in Jincheng took out a loan to invest and share dividends, and the village instructor took out a loan of 200,000 Yuan to buy sheep. There were even cadres who took out loans to gamble. Conversely, some cadres excessively emphasized the purpose of loans to the masses. For example, in a certain village in the Third District of Jincheng, the masses borrowed 100,000 Yuan, and the cadres forcibly compelled them to buy two head of livestock. The masses had neither spare funds nor sufficient financial resources, making it difficult to purchase. This forced the masses to run around everywhere without being able to buy any. Later, they had to reluctantly buy two bad livestock in Gaodu Town. They could neither plow the fields nor grind the flour, instead saddling the masses with a burden. The bank's loan procedures were complicated. When the masses applied for loans from the bank, they couldn't find a shop guarantor in the city and couldn't get the loan, resulting in many trips to the city for nothing. Last year, the cadres of Dashe Village in Jiyuan County even loaned part of the funds to the targets of struggle. When the masses overthrew the targets of struggle, the bank realized this and asked the targets of struggle for the money. At that time, they were questioned by the masses: "Why didn't you lend us the money?" The Yangcheng County United Cooperative once used the masses' loans for cooperative business. The Tongyi Village Cooperative took out a loan and then asked the targets of struggle to run an iron furnace. Not only did it fail to achieve any results, but it also ruined the cooperative. There were also errors in the United Cooperative's personnel employment. The Second District United Cooperative employed more than 20 people, and the Sixth District United Cooperative employed 18 people, but only one person was used to support the facade of the United Cooperative's credit department. All of these things have created many difficulties and unnecessary concerns for the impoverished masses in obtaining loans, such as being afraid to borrow because they fear they cannot repay. As the masses in Jincheng complained to us: "We are always called upon for errands, we can't escape the burdens, we don't get to share the good fruits, and we don't get loans! Public and private shops look down on us!" In the past, we also made many innovations in our loan work. For example, Comrade Jing Yitao of the Wangwu Bank repeatedly inspected the villages after lending money to the masses to understand what the masses were doing and how they were doing it after receiving the loans. The Jincheng Bank created the method of "going far and coming near," where bank cadres went to the villages to lend money to the masses in villages far from the bank, and the masses went to the bank themselves to borrow money in villages near the bank. At the meeting, it was also determined that the policy for winter production loans was: temporary work teams composed of strong cadres from the county and district should go deep into the villages to directly issue loans. If loans flow into the hands of non-impoverished people, those responsible should be investigated and disciplined. Regarding the organization of mass production, the Industry and Tax Bureau, trade companies, banks, and other departments should be responsible for their respective duties according to their work nature to vigorously help the masses solve various difficulties.

[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 18th] The Taiyue Administrative Office issued a decision on winter production loans on December 10, the summary of which is as follows:

In order to effectively solve the difficulties of the impoverished and help the impoverished organize production, the Border Region Government has allocated 70,000,000 Yuan in production loans to the impoverished in our region. In order to ensure that the loans are given to the impoverished, the following decisions are made:

(1) Only by enlightening the impoverished, raising their awareness of production, and meeting their demands for production loans can we ensure that the loans are given to the impoverished.

The purpose of the loans is to organize the impoverished for production, so that the impoverished can benefit and truly solve their difficulties. Therefore, it is wrong to think that lending the money is the end of the matter, or to not be serious or responsible for the impoverished. Therefore, loans should not only be lent out, but also combined with labor to play a role. On the other hand, loans should mobilize and organize the impoverished into loan committees to be responsible for evaluation, understand the demands of the impoverished through the impoverished class, and lay the foundation for land reform. Therefore, loans are not only a favorable condition for production, but also a preparation for land reform.

(2) Due to the lack of a clear impoverished perspective among general cadres, due to the possible conflicts in thinking and emotions between village cadres and village cooperatives regarding loans, due to the short period of time, many tasks, few cadres, and mixed thoughts, coupled with the sluggish flow of materials, unstable prices, low profits from textile production, and narrow sales channels, as well as the approaching Lunar New Year and the impending land reform work, in order to successfully complete this task, governments at all levels and systems must allocate personnel and vigorously organize loan work teams to go directly to the villages, delve into the impoverished, and carry out work to overcome the tendency of not going deep into the impoverished and simply considering loan work as the work of the bank or the government. At the same time, we must also recognize the favorable conditions for loans. First, they meet the demands of the impoverished. Second, general cadres have initially established an impoverished perspective and explored the route of employing and supporting the impoverished. Third, impoverished organizations have been established. Therefore, as long as we enlighten the impoverished's production enthusiasm and loan demands, all the above difficulties can be solved.

(3) When carrying out work, in addition to unifying forces for work, government departments at all levels and systems, financial and economic departments, the Cooperation Committee, and county and district united cooperatives should also clarify the division of labor. In terms of trade, we should organize material exchanges, control prices, report on market conditions, and lead the masses to open up the Northwest trade route. In addition to organizing transportation trading agencies, the industry and commerce system should also organize planned horse and mule fairs and transform temple fairs to promote material circulation and solve the production difficulties of the masses. In addition to organizing agricultural credit loans, the banking system should also conduct regular inspections. If it is found that there are non-impoverished loans or old loans, they should be recovered and lent to the impoverished. The financial departments should combine with economic and trade departments and banks, and organize financial and economic forces in certain places when necessary to stabilize prices. The United Committee and county and district united cooperatives should combine with the Industry and Tax Bureau to transform small shops and mule and horse shops that retain personnel, and try to organize transit cargo depots to help the masses solve difficulties such as "goods dying at the destination."

(4) In order to complete the above tasks, unify the policy, unify understanding, unify forces, and unify steps. Under the unified leadership of each county, treat it as a central task for a concentrated effort and carry it out effectively. At the same time, we must pay close attention to inspection, emphasize discipline, reward those who have made achievements, and punish those who have lent to the wrong targets. This work should be completed by the end of this month, and a summary report should be submitted to the Administrative Office by January 15 next year.

In addition, a few specific issues are raised for reference:

1. The loan target must be the impoverished, including lower-middle peasants who have not yet been emancipated and lower-middle peasants who have been emancipated. Loans may not be given to blank villages that have not been mobilized. 2. The purpose is basically for production, but in form, it can be used in various ways according to the specific conditions of each county, district, and village, and should not be mechanically restricted. 3. The interest rate should be 1.5% per month as stipulated, not 2%, in order to take care of the impoverished. 4. The scope of the loans should be based on villages with a foundation of work, those seriously destroyed by the enemy, those with poor harvests due to disaster this year, and impoverished areas. More loans should be given to villages with more impoverished people. Resolutely implement the principle of focusing on key areas and oppose the idea of ​​equal distribution. 5. The procedures should be simple, and it is best to lend the money directly to the village. The "going far and coming near" method of the Jincheng Branch can be promoted. 6. How to find the impoverished? The impoverished find the impoverished. Only the impoverished can recognize the impoverished, understand the difficulties of the impoverished, and experience the suffering of the impoverished. They can stand on the position of the impoverished to solve the problems of the impoverished. Therefore, we must boldly trust the impoverished and build this policy on the basis of the impoverished's awareness. Mass problems can only be solved by the masses. The view of looking upwards and relying solely on the public is wrong. On the mass side, we should try our best to overcome difficulties and rely on our own efforts. On the public side, we should think of various ways and organize various forces according to the existing conditions to try our best to help the masses solve their difficulties.

    太岳行署指示
    组织雇贫发放冬贷
    检讨过去明确方针
    分发冬贷七万万元
    【本报太岳十八日电】太岳行署拨发七万万元冬季生产贷款。行署于本月十日，在驻地召开二、四专区各县县长、银行经理等干部会议，研究七万万元贷款如何完全贷给歉收贫瘠地区之雇贫群众，组织生产致富。会中发言踊跃，首先严格检查过去贷款工作中的缺点，主要是群众观点模糊，没走雇贫路线，贷款给干部、合作社、中农以上成份者更多。如晋城某村武委会主任，拿贷款入股分红，村指导员贷款二十万元，买了羊。甚至还有干部贷款赌博的。反之，有的干部对群众贷款过分强调用途，如晋城三区某村群众贷款十万元，干部硬强制其买两头牲口，群众既无游资结合，财力不足，购买困难，致使群众到处奔跑买不到，后来只得在高都镇免强买下两头坏牲口，既不能犁地，又不能磨面，反给群众背了个包袱。银行贷款手续复杂，群众向银行贷款，到城里找不到铺保，贷不上，来回白跑路的事很多。去年济源大社村干部，竟把贷款一部贷给了斗争对象，当群众斗倒斗争对象时，银行才发觉，向斗争对象讨款，当时遭到群众质问：“为什你们不把款贷给我们呢？”阳城区联社，曾把群众的贷款搞了合作社业务，通义村合作社贷了款，又叫斗争对象搞铁炉，不仅没搞出成绩来，反把合作社搞垮了。联合社用人也有差错，二区区联社用了二十余人，六区区联社用了十八人，但在联社信用部只用一人支持门面。如此种种，都给雇贫群众贷款造成了许多困难及不必要的顾虑，如不敢借贷，怕还不起。正如晋城群众埋怨我们说：“支差有咱，负担漏不了咱，好果实分不给咱，贷款轮不到咱！公私商店瞧不起咱！”我们过去在贷款工作中也有不少创造。如王屋银行景一涛同志贷给群众款后，他还到村再三检查，了解群众贷款后做什么，怎样做。晋城银行创造了“远去近来”的办法，距银行远的村，银行干部到村去给群众贷款，距银行近的，群众自己到银行去贷。会上，并确定冬季生产贷款方针为：由县区坚强干部组成临时工作队，深入村里直接发放贷款，贷款如流于非雇贫手中，查出后应追究责任，并要受到纪律处分。关于组织群众生产问题，工税局、贸易公司、银行等部门，均按工作性质分别责任，以大力帮助群众解决各种困难。
    【本报太岳十八日电】太岳行署于十二月十日发出关于冬季生产贷款的决定，摘要如下：
    为切实解决雇贫困难，帮助雇贫组织生产，边府特拨给我区雇贫生产贷款七万万元，为保证把款贷给雇贫，特作如下决定：
    （一）雇贫贷款只有启发雇贫，提高雇贫生产自觉与生产贷款的要求，才能保证把款贷给雇贫。
    贷款目的是为了组织雇贫生产，使雇贫有利可图，确实解决雇贫困难。因此，把款贷出就完事，不对雇贫认真负责或不负责到底的观点，是不对的。所以，贷款不仅是贷出去，而且要使贷款与劳力结合起来，发挥作用。另一方面，贷款要发动雇贫、组织雇贫贷款委员会，负责评议，透过雇贫阶层，了解雇贫要求，打下土改基础。因此，贷款不仅在生产上是有利的条件，而且是土改的准备工作。
    （二）由于一般干部雇贫观点不明确，由于村干部与村合作社在贷款上思想情绪可能有抵触，由于期间短、任务多、干部少、思想杂，再加上物资不畅流，物价不稳，纺织赚钱少，销路狭，以及旧历年关已不远，土改工作快来到，在这些条件下，为胜利完成这一任务，政府各级各系统必须抽调人员，大力组织贷款工作队，直接到村，深入雇贫，进行工作，克服不深入雇贫以及把贷款工作单纯认为是银行或政府的工作等倾向。同时，也要认识贷款的有利条件，首先，适合雇贫要求。其次，一般干部初步建立雇贫观点，摸索到雇贫路线。第三，已建立了雇贫组织。因此，只要启发雇贫生产情绪与贷款要求，上述一切困难均可迎刃而解。
    （三）在进行工作时，政府各级各系统，除统一力量进行工作外，财经部门与合委会、县区联社还要明确分工，贸易上，要组织物资交流，掌握物价，报导商情，带领群众打通西北贸易路线。工商系统除组织运输交易介绍所外，有计划的组织骡马大会，改造庙会，以促进物资流通，解决群众生产困难。银行系统除组织农信贷外，还应该随时检查，如发现有非雇贫贷款，或旧有贷款，收回后均应贷给雇贫。财政部门要与经济贸易、银行结合，必要时在一定地方组织财经力量，平抑物价。联合委会、县区联社要结合工税局改造留人小店、骡马大店，并尽量组织转运货栈，帮助群众解决“货到地头死”等困难。
    （四）为完成上述任务，统一方针，统一认识，统一力量，统一步调，在各县的一元化领导下，当成突击的中心任务，确实进行。同时，要抓紧检查，强调纪律，有成绩的奖，贷错对象的处分。这一工作限于本月底贷完，明年一月十五号总结报告行署。
    另外几个具体问题，提出如下意见，作为参考：
    一、贷款对象一定是雇贫，未翻身的下中农与翻身后的下中农均包括在内。未发动过的空白村可以不贷。二、用途，基本上是用于生产，但形式上可根据各县、区、村具体条件，多种多样使用，不要机械限制。三、利息按规定月利一分半，不要二分，是为了照顾雇贫。四、贷款面要根据工作有基础的、敌人摧毁严重的、今年灾荒歉收的以及贫瘠地区村庄，雇贫多的要多贷，坚决实行重点主义，反对平均分配思想。五、手续要简，最好能把款直接贷到村。晋城支行“远去近来”的办法可以提倡。六、如何找雇贫？以雇贫找雇贫，只有雇贫才能认识雇贫，了解雇贫困难，体验雇贫的痛苦，能站在雇贫立场解决雇贫问题。所以我们要大胆相信雇贫，把这一方针建筑在雇贫的自觉基础上。群众问题只有群众解决，眼睛向上，单纯依靠公家的观点是不对的。群众方面，应尽力克服困难，自力更生。公家方面，应根据现有条件，想尽各种办法，组织各种力量，尽力帮助群众解决困难问题。
