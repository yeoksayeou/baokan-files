Mobilizing the Masses by Sparking Fires
  Correspondence from the Yu-Xi (Western Henan) Military Campaign
    Wen Cen
    The "Military Campaign Work Team" of the Yi-Luo Special Prefecture in Western Henan arrived in Zhongyu Village, Luoning South County, on September 19th and began "mobilizing the masses by sparking fires"—regardless of whether they stayed for three days or two, they immediately began work to mobilize the masses. In addition to following the military's movements, our second team stayed in Xiaoyuan Village for two and a half days, in Dongxi Wang Village, Zhao Village, the Chen Song area for two days, and in Hongling for two days, leaving Luoning on October 14th to follow the military east. During the six and a half days of work, fires were lit in all the villages mentioned above. The masses created many experiences in their actions, and they have been initially mobilized and organized. The situations in Xiaoyuan, Zhao Village, and Chen Song Village are reported below:
    (1) Mobilizing the Masses Through Grain Lending and Distribution
    Xiaoyuan is a poor village with thirty to forty households. Only two households in the village do not rent land to cultivate, and three households are destitute and do not cultivate any land at all. The rest all rent land in other villages. The village has a total of about 190 mu of self-cultivated dry and irrigated land, and rents in about 204 mu of dry and irrigated land. On average, each person has only about six fen of dry land and less than one fen of irrigated land of self-cultivated land. Most families rely on "eating green" (eating unripe corn cobs in the fields). Some households have even eaten all of their own autumn crops before they are ripe! Some do not even have "green" to eat anymore.
    In the days before our army recovered Luoning, the enemy was still frantically conscripting soldiers and sending laborers. In addition to building fortifications in the city, they also ordered each township to build a central village within a set timeframe for "sealing grain" (meaning paying enough grain silver). The suffering of the masses had reached an extreme point, and they really could not live any longer. When we arrived in the village, we immediately held a mass meeting, reported the victory news, and announced the government's three current policies: stop paying rent and interest, borrow grain from wealthy households to eat, borrow wheat seeds, and distribute the autumn crops of fleeing despotic landlords. After a day of individual visits and investigations, we found more than ten activists who were not only willing to approach us and report materials on treacherous despots, but also urgently requested that we take them to the homes of wealthy households to borrow grain.
    The next day, we decided to go to the Wei family in Dayuan Village, a neighboring village, to borrow grain. When we first left the village, there were only about ten people, but the number continued to increase on the road. (Some people in the village, seeing them leave, also grabbed their sacks and followed!) When we arrived in Dayuan Village, there were forty-seven people. Some who were afraid to participate had secretly gone to Dayuan first, and when they saw that everyone was taking action, they joined in. Some households sent both men and women, young and old. The targets of the grain borrowing, the Wei brothers, had both served as district chiefs and secretaries in the county government in the stubborn area, and had committed many evil deeds, which the masses hated extremely. When the masses arrived, the men in their family had all fled, leaving only some women at home. At first, the cadres led the negotiation to borrow grain and distribute it to the masses. Later, the masses in Dayuan Village also requested to participate, and the number of people increased, pushing the cadres out of the way. The masses took the initiative to load grain and search for hidden grain everywhere. During this action, many people cursed the Wei family while distributing grain and complaining about their suffering. Some immediately wrote a couplet on their gate: "Brother district chief, younger brother district chief, brothers district chief; Big dead dog, small dead dog, big and small dead dogs."
    This time, leading the masses to borrow and distribute grain developed into a mass struggle against the homes of despotic landlords. After the masses in both villages obtained grain, clothing, and furniture, their morale was extremely high. That night, Xiaoyuan Village spontaneously began to discuss the issue of dividing autumn crops and asked the cadres: "Dare we divide the landlord's bamboo garden?" We immediately helped them organize a peasant association and told them: "Now the peasant association is in charge. Everyone can do whatever they want, as long as everyone is willing to do it and dares to do it!" The masses said excitedly: "We are not afraid of anything, as long as we don't violate the laws of our government, which we don't understand!"
    That night, we received a notice from our superiors: "Depart at five o'clock tomorrow morning!" We reluctantly left the masses in Xiaoyuan Village.
    (2) Sparking Fires and Collecting Grain in Zhao Village
    On the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, we marched to Zhao Village, where our main task was to collect grain for the army. We applied the experience of sparking fires in Xiaoyuan in the past, and immediately carried out propaganda and mobilization among the masses upon arrival. We quickly discovered that the masses in this village hated the despotic self-defense team leader, He Shouren, and decided to deal with the He family. Zhao Village is a market town, and that day happened to be market day, so many people from nearby villages who came to the market also participated in the struggle against "Team Leader He's" family, which had an even greater impact.
    While the masses were snatching things to distribute, they said angrily: "You forced us to go hungry to build a central village for you. Now the day has come for us to get ahead!"
    After the initial mobilization of the masses, the activists discovered in the actions were first organized into a poor peasant group. They quickly told us that there were more than ten wealthy households in the village, such as ××, with grain reserves (the village has more than 500 households in total). We then convened a grain borrowing meeting of eleven "good households" and proposed a task of borrowing fifty shi (each shi is 500 jin) of grain. They immediately reported forty-five shi. Later, they themselves proposed two more good households with grain reserves, and a total of thirteen households stockpiled the borrowed grain in one day.
    (3) The Fire is Burning, Everyone Hurry Up and Come Help!
    Chen Song Village has more than 230 households, and there are extremely many poor households. Most of them rent land to cultivate, but they cannot rent enough land. As a result, more than 150 households make a living by grinding tofu, more than 40 households weave bamboo products to sell, and more than 30 households are boatmen (Chen Song is a ferry crossing on the south bank of the Luo River). These three types of people are extremely poor. "Without money, there is no power, and poor households are households that suffer." Therefore, they suffer the most oppression. When we arrived in the village, two cadres and one correspondent, three people, worked for two days, and the fire was lit.
    On the day we arrived in the village, after propaganda at the mass meeting and individual visits after the meeting, we specifically convened a "Three-More Meeting" in the evening (more tofu grinders, more bamboo weavers, more boatmen). Four to five hundred people attended, and we discovered activists while complaining about their suffering, and also learned about the despotic targets.
    A poor peasant named Li Zhi'an was detained in the Zhao Village Township Office (forty to fifty people who had been conscripted were detained together) on the day before the recovery of Luoning, and was prepared to be escorted to the city the next day. That day, he entrusted a "favor" to guarantee that he could go home for one night, and come back to go to the city early the next morning. However, the next day, he heard that our army had entered Luoning City, and he still couldn't believe it. He ran to the city overnight to see, and happened to encounter the troops capturing a company commander of the military service section (in charge of capturing soldiers) in the city and handing him over to the masses to struggle against. Li Zhi'an also knew this bad egg. He was extremely happy, and also joined the struggle to vent his anger. He didn't dare tell anyone after returning home. After he participated in the "Three-More Meeting," he first came to find our cadres, talked a lot about the situation in the village, and finally said: "I was taken away by the Central Army. If you had come one day later, I would have been finished. Now I am not afraid of anything!"
    Another person named Zhang Zhong, who sells tofu, and his brother found our cadres to complain about the hatred of his wife being raped by the despotic guarantor, and asked to avenge him. The despotic guarantor, Wei Shengfu, befriended the Japanese captain when the Japanese were here. He served as a guarantor for a year and a half, got rich by relying on enemy forces, and did all kinds of evil. He had raped twenty to thirty women in the village. Once, he went to Zhang Zhong's house and saw Zhang Zhong's brother grinding tofu in the yard. He shot at him casually but did not kill him. Zhang Zhong's brother escaped, and he entered the room and raped Zhang's wife. After that, he often went to his house. Even one day, when both Zhang Zhong and his wife were working in the field, Wei sent someone to call Zhang's wife back, and Zhang had to swallow his anger. This time, when he saw the "Eighth Route Comrades," he asked for revenge.
    After a very short period of brewing overnight, it was decided to first struggle against Wei Shengfu. Early the next morning, Wei was detained, struggled against first, and then his property was distributed.
    On the morning of October 2nd, the enemy entered Luoning City, but dared not stay for a day, and fled overnight that afternoon. The landlords and despots who were waiting for the situation to change were greatly disappointed this time. The masses' emotions were not affected in the slightest. On the contrary, they were even more convinced of the victory of our army and resolutely stated: "The landlords are looking forward to the arrival of the Central Army every day, to scare us. Now that their Central Army has come, they didn't even dare to stop for a day, and quickly ran away. They can't stand here either, what are we afraid of! The Eighth Route Army has gained a firm foothold this time and is settling down in Western Henan! Everyone hurry up and come help!"

　　走马点火发动群众
  　豫西随军工作通讯
    闻岑
    豫西伊洛专署“随军工作队”，九月十九号到了洛（宁）南县中峪村，开始了“走马点火”——不管停留三天两天，均立即进行发动群众——的工作。除随军行动外，我们二队在小原村住了两天半，在东西王村、赵村、陈宋一带，住了两天，在红岭住了两天，十月十四号离开洛南随军东行。在这进行工作的六天半中间，上述诸村的火都点着了。群众行动中创造出不少经验，群众已初步的发动与组织起来了。兹就小原、赵村、陈宋三个村的情形报导如下：
    （一）借粮分粮发动了群众
    小原是一个穷村，有三四十户人家，全村未租别人地种者二户，赤贫未种地者三户，其他全都租种外村的土地。全村自耕水旱地共约一九○余亩，共租入水旱地约二○四亩。自耕地每人平均起来，旱地不过六分，水地不足一分。大部人家均靠“吃青”（吃地里尚未成熟的玉茭棒子。）有些户甚至自己的一点秋庄稼，等不到熟，就已吃光了！连“青”也没得吃的了。
    我军收复洛宁的前几天，敌人还在疯狂抓壮丁，派民夫，除修城里工事外，还每乡修一个中心寨子，并限期“封粮”（即交足粮银的意思）群众苦痛已极，实在到了无法再活下去的地步了。我们到村即召开群众大会，报告了胜利消息之后，即宣布政府当前的三项政策：停交租息，向大户借粮吃，借麦种，分逃亡恶霸地主的秋庄稼。经过一天的个别访问调查，即发现积极分子十余人，不仅敢于接近我们，诉说奸霸材料，而且迫切要求我们带着去大户家借粮。
    次日即决定去邻村大原村韦家去借粮。初出村时群众仅十余人，在路上即不断增多。（村中有些人看他们走了，也就拿着布袋随后跟来了！）到大原村时，人数是四十七人。原来有些不敢参加的却绕道先到了大原，看大家干起来了，他们就也参加了。有些户男女老少都来了。借粮对象韦家弟兄二人均当过顽区长及县政府秘书，作恶多端，群众极为痛恨。群众到时，他家男人都逃跑了，只剩一些妇女在家。开始由干部带领，交涉借粮，分给群众。后来大原村的群众，也纷纷要求参加，人愈来愈多，干部就被挤掉了。群众自己动手装粮食，到处找藏粮。在这一行动中，不少群众一边分粮一边诉苦咒骂韦家，有人当即在其大门上写了一付对联：“兄区长弟区长兄弟区长；大死狗小死狗大小死狗。”
    这次由领导群众借粮分粮，发展成为群众性的斗争恶霸地主的家。两村群众拿到了粮食衣物家具后，情绪极为高涨。小原村当晚即自动酝酿分秋问题，并问干部：“我们敢不敢把地主的竹园子分了？”我们当即帮助他们组织起农会，告他们：“现在是农会当家，大家愿意怎干就怎干，只要大家愿意干，敢干就行！”群众很兴奋的说：“我们啥都不怕，只要不犯咱们政府的法，我们都不懂啊！”
    这天夜里我们接到上级通知：“明晨五点钟出发！”我们恋恋不舍的离开了小原村的群众。
    （二）点火筹粮在赵村
    在八月中秋的前一天，我们行军到了赵村，主要任务是筹借军队食粮。我们应用过去在小原点火的经验，到的这天立即向群众进行了宣传动员，很快就发现了这村群众痛恨的恶霸自卫团队长贺寿仁，即决定搞贺家。赵村是一个集市，这天恰逢集，附近很多村子的赶集群众也都参加了斗争“贺队长”的家，所以影响更大了。
    群众一面抢着分东西，一面气愤地说：“你逼着我们饿着肚子去给你修中心寨，现在可熬到我们出头的日子了！”
    经过群众的初步发动，将行动中所发现的积极分子先组织起贫农组来。他们很快的告诉我们，该村大户尚有××等十余家有存粮（全村五百多户），我们就召集了十一家“好户”的借粮会议，提出借粮五十大石（每石五百斤）的任务，他们即自动报了四十五石，后来他们自己又提出两户有存粮的好户，一共十三户一天就把借粮屯起来了。
    （三）火燃起来了，大家赶快赶来干吧。
    陈宋村有二百三十多户人家，穷户极多，大部均租地种，租地也租不到足够的地，因之磨豆腐为生者有一百五十多户，编竹货卖的有四十多户，船夫三十多户（陈宋是洛河南岸一个渡口）。这三种人均极端贫苦，“没钱就没势，穷户就是受气户”，所以他们受压迫也最利害。我们到该村去两个干部一个通讯员，三个人工作了两天，火就燃起来了。
    到村的那天，经群众会上宣传与会后个别访问之后，晚上就专门召开了一个“三多会”（磨豆腐多、编竹货多、船夫多。）到会四五百人，诉苦中发现积极分子，也了解了恶霸对象。
    一个贫农叫李治安，在收复洛宁的前一天，正他被扣押在赵村乡公所（抽壮丁抓走的四五十人都押在一起），准备次日即往城里押送。这天他托了“人情”保住他回家住一晚，次日一早再来去城里，可是第二天听说咱们军队打进了洛宁城，他还不敢相信，连夜跑到城里去看，恰遇部队在城里捉着一个兵役科（管抓兵的）的连长，交给群众斗争。李治安也认识这个坏蛋，他高兴极了，也跟着参加了斗争，出了出气，回家后还不敢告人说。他参加了“三多会”之后，就先来找咱们干部，谈了很多该村情况，最后表示：“我是被中央抓走了的人，你们要晚来一天我就算完了，现在我啥也不怕啦！”
    另外一个叫张忠，是个卖豆腐的，弟兄二人找着咱们干部诉说他妻子被恶霸保长强奸的仇恨，要求替他报仇。恶霸保长韦生福，老日在时他与日本大队长交了朋友，连任保长一年半，依靠敌人势力发了家，无恶不作，该村妇女被他强奸了的有二三十人之多。他有一次到张忠家去，看到张忠哥哥正在院中磨豆腐，他随手一枪未将人打死，张忠哥哥被逃跑了，他即进房将张妻强奸了，以后就时常去他家。甚至有一天张忠夫妻二人均在地里做活，韦即派人把张妻叫回，张亦只好忍气吞声。这次见到“八路同志”，即要求报仇。
    经过夜晚很短时间的酝酿，就决定先斗韦生福。次日一早即将韦扣起，先斗争了他，然后分了他的财产。
    十月二号上午敌人进了洛宁城，一天也没敢停留，下午就又连夜逃走了。地主恶霸们等着变天的，这次大失所望，群众情绪不仅未受丝毫影响，反而更加相信我军之胜利，并坚决表示：“地主们天天盼望中央军来，吓唬我们，现在他们的中央军来了，一天都不敢停，就赶快跑了。他来也站不住脚，咱们怕啥！八路这次是站稳了，要在豫西安家哩！大家都赶快来干吧！”
