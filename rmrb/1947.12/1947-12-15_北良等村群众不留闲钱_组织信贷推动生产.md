    【Report from this newspaper in Neiqiu】In order to vigorously support winter production and solve the problem of production funds for poor peasants and hired laborers, Beiliang, Mengcuntun, Shutan, and other five villages have organized credit departments and have already achieved results. At the joint meeting of village cooperative chairmen in the Second District, most villages pointed out: The peasants who have turned over want to engage in production but lack capital, or cannot turn over capital due to insufficient capital, which affects the vigorous development of winter production. Wang Lan of Beiliang Village immediately said: "Our village has organized a credit department, and after a month of activity, this problem has been initially resolved." He immediately introduced it at the conference: "After our village conducted a household-by-household planning and accounting after the autumn harvest, many households did not have enough grain to eat and had to carry burdens, which was due to a lack of capital. Later, I discussed with the cadres and the masses to turn dead money into active money and dead objects into active objects, and organized credit activities. The whole village totaled 109 people who invested 70,000 yuan, the cooperative withdrew 100,000 yuan, and the bank assisted with 85,000 yuan, totaling 255,000 yuan, which means that everyone is active. If you have money, deposit it to get profit, and if you don't have money, borrow it to earn money, which is convenient for yourself and everyone else, benefiting both labor and capital. The loan principle is mainly to support agricultural and sideline production and textile industry. Since it was organized on August 21, in the one and a half months of activity until the beginning of October, 9 households deposited 120,250 yuan, 3 households borrowed loans to buy cattle, 4 households bought agricultural tools, 4 households engaged in textile industry, 3 households engaged in transportation, 2 households engaged in commerce, and 4 other households, totaling 20 households, borrowed 174,000 yuan. The transportation alone earned a profit of 82,700 yuan, and the others are still active and have not yet been accounted for. The masses earned a profit of 68,760 yuan from deposits, and the cooperative earned a profit of 111,760 yuan. Everyone is active, and the masses happily said, 'Our village also has a small bank.'" After the introduction, everyone felt that this was a very good method, and immediately 11 villages including Dameng Village wanted to establish credit departments, and 15 villages including Liangyuan Store wanted to organize credit cooperatives to specifically solve the problem of production funds for the masses.
    Under the slogan of "the more you invest, the more you earn," Mengcuntun opened up the minds of the masses, and men and women competed to raise funds, investing 10 shi, 3 dou and 4 sheng (city shi) of grain and 42,250 yuan in one night. Out of 125 households in the village, 108 households joined the shares, accounting for 86.3% of the total number of households. From the perspective of the population, 154 men, women and children became shareholders of the credit cooperative. It also stipulated the method of combining deposit change stock (that is, deposits are calculated according to capital together with the dividends earned within five months when the deposit is more than five months), stock change deposit, and stock deposit (the cooperative distributes dividends according to shares at the time of settlement, such as withdrawing shares before the time of settlement, interest is earned according to deposits), which is convenient for deposit and withdrawal without any restrictions, and borrowing and repayment are also free. Everyone put forward the slogan that this winter, we must achieve "no idle people in the village and no idle money in hand." At the same time, this organization also closely linked the cooperative with the masses, and the masses realized that the cooperative is their own economic organization.
    After discussion, the masses in Nanling Village realized that organizing credit activities is both beneficial and convenient. Those with money can deposit and get interest, and those without money can borrow loans for production. Men, women and children have already invested 79,000 yuan, and they are still continuing to invest.
    Hushutan focused on labor and used the poor and hired laborers as the backbone in organizing transportation, earning petty money and organizing credit activities to engage in production on a large scale. The whole village gathered 130,000 yuan in shares, with you contributing 3,000 and him contributing 2,000, and the interest rate was uniformly set by the masses. The next day, military family member Lü Shani borrowed a loan to engage in sideline business and has now started operations.
    The masses in Changfeng Village invested 50,000 yuan and 60 jin of cotton. The cooperative took out another 200,000 yuan, totaling 250,000 yuan, to vigorously support the textile industry, concentrate the scattered idle funds, solve a major problem in winter production, and both labor and capital can get the benefits they deserve, so that everyone is active and everyone benefits, and winter production will be vigorously developed.

    组织信贷推动生产
    【本报内邱讯】为了大力扶植冬季生产和解决贫雇群众的生产资金困难，北良、孟村屯、树滩等五村槲已组织了信用部，并已作出了成绩。在二区村合作社长联席会议上，大部村提出：翻身农民想闹生产缺少本钱，或者因资本少周转不开，影响了冬季生产的大力开展。北良村王兰当即说：“俺村组织了信用部，经一月来活动，这个问题已得到初步解决。”他马上就在大会上作了介绍：“俺村秋后经过挨户订按家计划大算帐后，每户收粮不够吃，担担挑挑的人很多，就是缺本钱，后来我和干部群众商量，把死钱变成活钱，把死物变成活物，组织了信用活动，全村共计一百零九人入股七万元，合作社又抽出十万元，银行又扶助了八万五千元，共二十五万五千元，即作到了人人都活动，有钱就存把利得，没钱去贷把钱赚，自己方便，大家方便的劳资两利。贷款原则主要是扶植农副业生产和纺织。自八月二十一日组织起来，到十月初八一个半月的活动时间，就有九户存款十二万零二百五十元，贷款买牛三户，买农具四户，纺织四户，搞运输的三户，干商业的两户，其他四户，共二十户，贷款十七万四千元，只运输一项计算就得到红利八万二千七百元，其他还在活动未算帐。群众存款得利六万八千七百六十元，社里得利十一万一千七百六十元。作到了人人活动，群众高兴的说：“咱村也有了小银行了。”介绍后，大家都感到这是一个很好的办法，当即有大孟村等十一个村子要成立信用部，梁原店等十五个村要组织信用社，来具体解决群众生产资金困难。
    孟村屯在“入的多赚的多”的口号下，打通了群众的思想，男女竞赛集资，一晚上入粮食十石三斗四升（市石），入款四万二千二百五十元，全村一百二十五户，就有一百零八户入了股，占总户数百分之八十六点三，从人口上看，即有男女老少一百五十四人成了信用社的股东。并规定了存变股（即存款在五个月以上时，在五个月内所得之红利一并按资本计算）、股变存的股存相结合（合作社结帐时按股分红，如不到结帐时抽股按存款得利）办法，存取方便，不受任何限制，借还也随便。大家提出了口号，今冬要作到“村中无闲人，手中无闲钱”，同时，这样组织后也密切了合作社与群众的关系，群众认识了合作社是自己的经济组织。
    南岭村群众经过讨论，大家认识了组织信用活动又有利又方便，有钱的存了款得了利，无钱的又能贷款去生产，男女老少已入款七万九千元，现还在继续入。
    槲树滩在组织运输中以劳力为主，以贫雇为骨干，赚下零钱组织了信用活动，好大搞生产。全村你三千他两千，共集股十三万元，统一由群众订出了利息。第二天，军属吕沙妮即贷了款去搞副业，现已开始活动起来。
