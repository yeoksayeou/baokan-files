　　▲The peasants of Shuangliao (newly established county) on the north bank of the Liao River, who began to achieve emancipation after the Summer Offensive, organized armed work teams to cross the river and conduct expeditions in the Autumn Offensive, helping the masses in the marginal areas of Lishu and Changbei (newly established county, north of Changtu) on the south bank to achieve emancipation. They first defeated the local bandits and unearthed the landlords' guns and ammunition. The armed work team members described the emancipation of the masses on the north bank and explained the "Outline Land Law of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" at mass meetings, calling on the masses to rise up for revenge and distribute land. At the meeting, they also led poor peasants to distribute a large number of winter clothes.
    ▲The peasants of Faku, who were liberated after the Autumn Offensive, combined with the local armed forces to launch a political offensive in order to clear the obstacles to emancipation, universally confiscating the landlords' armed forces and rural black guns. In five days, they seized 1,836 rifles, 709 grenades, and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition.
    ▲In the area of ​​Bamiancheng, the newly liberated area is adjacent to the Chiang bandit area, and there are many bandits. The masses "held a gun in one hand and distributed land in the other," and opened large-scale training courses for poor and hired peasants to train a large number of activists to take the lead in distributing land. In one month, 38 administrative villages have been opened up, with 70,000 people involved in the emancipation movement, and 17 administrative villages have been taken over by the poor and hired peasants. The county's armed forces have expanded fourfold.
    ▲The peasants in the newly recovered areas in the southern section of the China Changchun Railway have set off a raging fire of emancipation. In Yingkou, after the democratic government announced the land policy in more than 30 villages and firmly supported the masses, the enthusiasm of the masses was high. At a mass meeting in Sunjiatun, an old man, Chai Xuanmin, grabbed his local tyrant relatives on the spot and went on stage to accuse the "Seven Tigers" and "Eight Wolves" of seizing his daughter-in-law. More than 100 people in Huanjiatun village captured the local tyrant landlord Sun Caiyun and paraded in a column, shouting "Seek justice and revenge." In the grain distribution movement in various villages, each household received up to one stone and two dou. In the emancipation movement, 137 emancipation heroes emerged. Currently, peasants in more than 30 villages are holding a celebration meeting for emancipation, holding high the banner of "Great Emancipation of Peasants" and "Poor People Want to Be Masters," and after the meeting, 150 young adults signed up to join the army.
    ▲The peasants of the Shen (Yang) Tie (Ling) Fu (Shun) United County, who have consistently adhered to the struggle against the enemy, first overthrew the landlord Wang Laoheshang and recovered more than 900 mu of land. The movement has spread to various places, and now it has become one with the mass movement in Qingyuan and Kaiyuan.
    ▲In the newly liberated villages of Funing County, Jidong, 109 villages and 84 marginal villages have successfully carried out land distribution movements in the past month and a half. The poor and hired peasants have begun to master political power. The peasants of the whole county have obtained more than 85,000 mu of land, more than 8,900 houses, and 2.3 million jin of grain, more than 600 liang of silver, and seized many landlords' weapons and more than 3,300 rounds of ammunition. A large number of emancipated peasants poured into the army. In more than a month, 4,500 young adults joined the army in companies and platoons. 22 stretcher teams were organized with a total of 1,318 stretchers. In addition, more than 10,000 emancipated peasants participated in the war.
