Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 15th, commenting that the Soviet Union's currency reform and the abolition of rationing were "major events of the greatest economic and political significance." "The implementation of currency reform and the abolition of consumer goods rationing are indispensable conditions for increasing the value of the ruble, promoting further development of trade, prospering the national economy, and improving the people's living standards, and will sweep away the last remnants of war." The editorial pointed out: "Countries typically need to reform their currencies after a war. After this great war, as after the First World War, capitalist countries have experienced long-term currency chaos, rising prices, falling real wages, increased unemployment, and shrinking production. The bourgeoisie always tries to overcome the post-war economic crisis at the expense of the working masses. In imperialist countries, monopoly capitalists even want to use the so-called Marshall Plan to save themselves from panic at the expense of other countries. However, the Soviet Union's currency reform is completely different, and its result is to give the ruble full value, increase its purchasing power, thereby increasing the real income of working people and improving their living standards. Labor productivity will be further improved as a result, and the Five-Year Plan will be accelerated." The editorial forcefully stated: "The Soviet monetary system, based on a socialist planned economy, is the most solid and stable currency in the world. The new currency will play the most important role in the historical mission of the Soviet people completing the transition from socialism to communism." The editorial continued: "The Soviet Union was able to completely abolish the rationing system only one year after an unprecedentedly brutal war and the rare drought that followed. This is a new proof of the victorious realization of Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan." The editorial pointed out: The original ration price of second-class black bread was 3.4 rubles per kilogram, but after the abolition of rationing, it is sold for only 3 rubles. The prices of food and daily necessities have fallen by two to three times, and the new Five-Year Plan stipulates that retail prices in 1950 must be reduced to 28% of pre-war levels. Conversely, in capitalist countries, compared with wartime, the rationing of sugar, fat and meat in Britain has been reduced by about 20%, and bread and potatoes, which were not rationed during the war, are now rationed. France's bread ration has been drastically reduced twice this year, from 300 grams per day to only 200 grams. In the United States, the price of major commodities has risen by 40% in one year. These facts fully prove the great superiority of the socialist economic system over capitalism." The editorial finally forcefully stated: "The abolition of the rationing system will further enrich the strength of our great country's victorious march towards communism."
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Moscow dispatch: After the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party issued orders to reform the currency and abolish rationing, the Soviet Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade also promulgated decrees to implement currency reform and unify national retail prices. From the early morning of the 16th, the people of the entire Soviet Union went to special exchange offices set up by the National Bank in various places to exchange new currency. There were 1,160 exchange offices in Moscow alone, with 5,000 people participating in the assistance work. Crowds were everywhere, but the order was excellent. The new currency is divided into seven types: 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 3, and 1 ruble. At the same time, state-owned stores across the country also began to sell various foods and consumer goods at unified new prices. Since the war, this is the first time that such a variety of goods, abundant in quantity, low in price, and freely available for purchase, have appeared on the open market. People competed to choose and purchase. Since the second half of this year, in preparation for the abolition of the rationing system, the Ministry of Trade has followed the instructions of the Council of Ministers and opened 12,090 new stores in various places, and transported a large number of goods to the stores in preparation for timely supply to the market. In addition, 2.5 million copies of the unified price list of food and consumer goods were printed and delivered to stores across the country before the evening of the 15th. *Pravda* wrote an article on the 16th, stating: "The Soviet people sincerely thank the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government for their tireless concern for the people's welfare. The Soviet people congratulate each other on the arrival of this happiness."

    真理报论货币改革及废除配给

    【新华社陕北十八日电】莫斯科讯：真理报十五日发表社论，评论苏联货币改革及取消配给制，乃“具有最巨大经济政治意义的重要事件”。“实行货币改革、废除消费品配给制，是为了提高卢布价值，促进贸易进一步发展，以繁荣国民经济、改善人民生活所不可或缺的条件，并将清扫战争的最后残迹。”社论指出：“各国在战争以后通例均需改革货币，此次大战以后，一如第一次大战以后一样，各资本主义国家都发生了长期的货币紊乱、物价上涨、实际工资跌落、失业增加及生产萎缩等情形，资产阶级总竭力以工人群众为牺牲，来克服战后经济的危机。在帝国主义国家，独占资本家更想用所谓马歇尔计划，以牺牲他国而挽救自身的恐慌。但苏联的货币改革，却与之绝然不同，其结果在于予卢布以十足价值，提高其购买力，从而增加劳动人民的实际收入，并改善其生活水准。劳动生产力将因此而更为提高，五年计划将因此而加速完成”。社论力称：“以社会主义计划经济为基础的苏联货币制度，是世界上最巩固、最稳定的货币。新货币将在由苏联人民完成自社会主义过渡到共产主义的历史使命中，扮演最重要的角色。”社论继称：“苏联在空前惨烈的大战与随之而来的稀有荒旱之后，仅仅一年，即能全部废除配给制。这是斯大林战后五年计划胜利实现的新证明”。社论指出：原配给价格为每公斤三点四卢布的二等黑面包，在配给取消后仅售三卢布。食物与各项日用品的价格都跌落两三倍，而新五年计划规定一九五○年的零售价格须降底至战前百分之二十八。反之在资本主义国家与战时相比，英国食糖、脂肪与肉类的配给量竟减少百分之二十左右，而战时未实行配给的面包与洋芋等，现在已行配给。法国面包配给量今年已两度猛减，从每天三百公分减至只有二百公分，在美国主要货物一年内已上涨了百分之四十。这些事实，充分证明社会主义经济制度远超过资本主义的巨大优越性。”社论最后力称：“取消配给制，将进一步充实我们伟大国家胜利迈向共产主义的力量。”
    【新华社陕北十八日电】莫斯科讯：自苏联部长会议与联共中央下令改革货币与废除配给制后，苏联财政部与贸易部亦分别颁布实施货币改革与统一全国零售价格之法令。自十六日清晨起，全苏人民即分赴各地国家银行特设之兑换所兑换新币，莫斯科一地即有兑换所一千一百六十处，有五千人参加协助工作，到处拥满人群，但秩序极佳。新币计分一百、五十、二十五、十、五、三及一卢布等七种。同时，全国各国营商店亦开始按照统一之新价格出售各种食物及消费品，自战时以来，此尚为公开市场上第一次出现如此花色繁多、数量丰富、价格低廉而能自由购买之货品，人民竞相选择争购。今年下半年以来，贸易部为准备配给制之废除，已遵部长会议之训令，在各地开设新商店一万二千零九十所，并将大量商品运集各商店，以备及时应市。又印就统一之食品与消费品价格表二百五十万份，于十五日晚间以前送达全国各地商店。真理报十六日特撰论称：“苏联人民衷心感谢永不疲倦关心人民福利之布尔什维克党与苏联政府，苏联人民均为此一幸福之来临而互相庆贺”。
