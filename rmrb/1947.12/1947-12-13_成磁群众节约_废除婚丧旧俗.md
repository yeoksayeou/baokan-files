    Masses in Chengci Practice Thrift;
    Abolish Old Customs in Weddings and Funerals
    [Our Hebei-Henan Correspondent, 11th] The Third District of Chengci is abolishing old customs in weddings and funerals and practicing thrift. In light of this year's poor harvest, the district held a village cadre meeting on November 1st, calling for thrift and pointing out some serious wasteful practices. For example, Wu Fusheng's brothers, wealthy peasants from the Huatang anti-Japanese family, spent over 400,000 yuan on a wedding, and Yuan Fengming from Beigou village spent over 100,000 yuan on a daughter-in-law. The call pointed out that in order to survive the spring famine, weddings and funerals should be thrifty, breaking away from wasteful old customs. After this call was relayed to the villages, it was enthusiastically supported by the liberated masses. For example, Yuan Shuchen, a poor peasant from Dongxiangyi village, said regretfully: "Why didn't the higher-ups promote thrift earlier! After my mother died, the neighbors all said that my mother didn't enjoy any blessings when she was alive, and now that we've been liberated and have land, shouldn't we take care of things well? I was afraid the neighbors would laugh at me, so even though the children and adults didn't eat or drink well, I bought a coffin and burial clothes, each costing more than 20,000 yuan, the hired band cost 7,000 yuan, and buying paper horses, carriages, wine, cigarettes, etc. cost more than 110,000 yuan, which really made things difficult for me. Previously, eight people only had three mu of land, but this year we were liberated and divided up 22 mu. I just said things would be okay, but one mother's funeral sold all 19 bags of peanuts and still left me in debt." On November 10th, Zhang Lanting, a middle peasant from the village, responded to the call for thrift when his father died, using his own wood to make a small coffin, using his old clothes that he was wearing to make burial clothes, and didn't buy any paper horses or carriages. His nephew, who was in a band, wanted to come and play music, but he declined, saying, "People have changed the old customs, it would be shameful to use a band." Including other expenses, he saved at least 120,000 yuan. Also, Tian Chun from the village and Li Zhenbao from Hecun village originally planned to use a band and sedan chair to marry their wives. After the call for thrift, they didn't use them, each saving 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Li Lvyu said: "Now it's good. Like in the past, Li Mandong, a poor man, arranged a marriage for his daughter in Shacun, Guangping County, but because of the extravagance of the big wedding, the Shaguo family thought the small wedding was not respectable enough, and it was put off for eight years. See how difficult that was!" Now, most villages in the Third District have changed the old wasteful customs of weddings and funerals and are implementing thrift measures.

    成磁群众节约
    废除婚丧旧俗
    【本报冀南十一日电】成磁三区废除婚丧旧俗，实行节约。根据今年歉收，该区于十一月一日召开全区村干会，号召节约，并指出一些严重的浪费现象。如化唐富农抗属吴富生兄弟结婚，花费四十余万元，北沟村袁凤鸣娶儿媳花十余万元。号召指出，为渡过明春灾荒，遇有婚丧，要节省，打破浪费旧规矩。这号召传达到村后，翻身群众热烈拥护。如东乡义村贫农袁书臣后悔的说：“上级怎不早提倡节约呢！我母亲一死。邻家都说俺娘活着没享什么福，如今翻身有了法，还不好好办吗？我怕邻家笑话，那怕孩子大人不吃不喝，买了个棺材和送老衣，各花两万多元，叫的响器七千元，乡亲帮忙吃了四十多斤馒头，买纸扎车马、酒烟等费十一万多元，可把我难死了。先前八口人只有三亩地，今年翻身分了廿二亩，刚说可有法了，一遭母丧，把十九布袋花生卖完，还塌了一身窟窿。”十一月十号中农张兰廷的爹死了，响应节约号召，用自己的树合了一个小材，随身穿的旧衣拆洗一下作送老衣，也没买纸扎车马，他外甥本是响器班人，要来吹打，也辞下了，并说：“人家都改了旧规矩，咱再使响器还丢人哩。”加上其他费用顶少省十二万元。又该村田春的与河中村李真保娶媳妇，原说定响器、花轿。号召节约后，也不用了，各省六七万元。李吕有说：“现在可好。象过去穷人李满洞给广平县沙村的闺女订了婚，因大娶浪费，沙窝又嫌小娶不面子，直搁了八年。你看那时多么作难？”现三区大部分村子，都已改变了婚丧浪费旧规矩，实行节约办法了。
