Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party jointly issued an order on the 15th to implement currency reform and abolish the rationing system for food and daily necessities. The order, jointly issued by Stalin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and Zhdanov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, was implemented on the 16th. Its main contents are:

    (A) Currency Reform: Starting from the 16th of this month, new rubles of 1947 will be issued. Old currency will be uniformly exchanged for new currency within one week from the 16th to the 22nd (extended to the 29th for remote areas). Old currency will be invalid after the deadline. The exchange rate between old and new currency is set as follows: 1. Cash currently circulating in the market and held by the people will be exchanged for new currency at a rate of ten to one; (2) Deposits in savings banks and state banks will be exchanged at a rate of one to one for amounts up to 3,000 rubles, at a rate of three to two for the balance above 3,000 rubles up to 10,000 rubles, and at a rate of two to one for the balance above 10,000 rubles. This differential exchange rate will maintain the original amounts of the vast majority of Soviet people's deposits. Simultaneously with the currency reform, all government bonds issued in the past, except for those issued this year, will be converted into unified reconstruction bonds to be issued next year. Old bonds will be converted into new bonds at a price of three to one of the face value from May 3rd to August 3rd next year. During the currency reform process, wages, military pay, scholarships, pensions, relief funds, and subsidies in December will not be affected and will be issued in new currency at the original amounts.

    (B) Abolition of Rationing for Necessities: Starting from the 16th of this month, all food and daily necessities will be sold in open trade without rationing coupons. The country will implement retail prices uniformly stipulated by the government to replace the current dual-price system of commercial prices and ration prices. According to the new unified prices, bread will be 12 percent lower than the original ration price, grains will be 10 percent lower, and as much as two and a half times lower than the original commercial price. The prices of other foods such as fish, meat, sugar, and fruits will generally maintain the original ration price level. The prices of daily necessities are set slightly higher than the excessively low ration prices, but three and a half times lower than commercial prices.

    The order provides a very detailed explanation of the implementation of currency reform and the abolition of rationing, stating that during the four years of arduous patriotic war, the Soviet state had to issue more paper money to cope with huge expenditures in order to maintain a large army and develop the war industry, resulting in a large increase in currency circulation and a large reduction in people's necessities. At the same time, the German invaders also issued counterfeit currency in the vast occupied areas, further exacerbating the currency situation. However, the Soviet government always maintained the prices of food and daily necessities under the rationing system unchanged, ensuring the basic needs of the people and preventing inflation from endangering the economic foundation of the Soviet state. However, the black market prices of goods rose by ten to fifteen times due to the increased gap between supply and demand. Speculators took advantage of the huge difference between the two prices and the large amount of counterfeit money in circulation to manipulate and profit, harming the people. Today, the recovery of industry and the bumper harvest of agriculture have enabled the Soviet Union to restore open trade and unified prices and abolish rationing. However, if the excessive currency left over from the war is not cleared, it will create excessive demand from the people and promote price increases, and it will also enable those who made fortunes during the national crisis to continue hoarding and speculating. Therefore, currency reform must be implemented simultaneously, with new currency of full value replacing old currency of low value and counterfeit currency still in circulation. The order also points out that currency reform is a common practice in various countries after the war, but the Soviet currency reform is completely different from the currency reform in capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, the reform will inevitably lead to a huge increase in the prices of consumer goods, thereby reducing the real wages of the working people, increasing the number of unemployed, and shifting the consequences of the war and the main burden of currency reform to the working people. On the contrary, the Soviet currency reform will not only cause no harm to the working people, but the real wages of the working people will greatly increase due to the sharp fall in the prices of consumer goods. This reform will help increase the material welfare of the working people, promote the development of trade, and the prosperity of the national economy, and strengthen the power of the Soviet state.

    社会主义比资本主义无限优越
    斯大林日丹诺夫下令改革币制
    苏联人民生活提高两倍
    工业恢复农业丰收废除配给制
    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议与联共中央委员会，于十五日联合下令实行货币改革，并废除粮食与日用品配给制。命令由苏联部长会议主席斯大林与联共中央书记日丹诺夫联名公布，于十六日起实行。其主要内容为：
    （甲）货币改革部分：自本月十六日起，发行一九四七年新卢布，旧币统限于十六日至二十二日一周内（边远地区延至二十九日），兑换成新币，过期作废，旧币与新币之兑换率定为：一、凡现在市场流通，以及人民手中所持有之现款，按十比一比率兑换新币；（二）存放于储蓄银行与国家银行之存款，凡数在三千卢布以下者按一比一，数在一万卢布以下者，除其中三千卢布外，余额以三比二比率兑换新币，数在一万卢布以上者，除其中一万卢布外，统按二比一比率兑换新币。此项差等兑换率，将保持绝大多数苏联人民之存款的原有数额。与货币改革同时，政府过去所发行之一切公债，除今年发行者外，均将折换定明年发行之统一复兴公债，旧公债定于明年五月三日至八月三日按票面三比一之价格折换成新公债。在货币改革过程中，即十二月之工资、军俸、奖学金、养老金、恤金及津贴等，均不受影响，而以新币按原数发给之。
    （乙）废除必需品配给制部分：自本月十六日起，一切食品与日用品在公开贸易场合下出售，而无需配给券。全国实行由政府统一规定之零售价格，以代替现行之商业价格与配给价格之双重价格制。按照新统一价格，面包将较原配给价格减低百分之十二，谷物降低百分之十，较原商业价格减低达两倍半，其他食品如鱼肉、糖、果等，大体维持原配给价格水平。至日用品价格，规定略高于过低之配给价格，而较商业价格减低三倍半。
    命令对实行货币改革及取消配给制加以极详尽之解释，说明在四年艰巨之爱国战争时期，苏维埃国家为维持大量军队及发展战争工业，而不得不增发纸币，以应付浩大之开支，结果使货币流通量大为增加，人民必需品大为减缩；同时，德寇更在广大之侵占区滥发伪币，使通货情形更为恶化。但苏联政府始终使粮食与日用品配给制价格维持不变，确保人民之基本需要，而未令通货膨胀危及苏维埃国家之经济基础。但货物之黑市价格，则因供求差额之增大，而高涨至十倍到十五倍之多。投机分子乃利用两种价格间之巨大差异，与大量流通之伪钞，操纵牟利，贻害人民。时至今日工业之恢复与农业之丰收，已使苏联能恢复公开贸易与统一价格并取消配给制。但如不清除战时遗下之过量通货，将造成人民之过份需求，而促使物价上涨，且能使发国难财者仍得囤集居奇；因此，必须同时实行货币改革，以十足价值之新币代替价值低下之旧币与仍在流通之伪币。命令并指出：货币改革乃各国在大战后之通例，但苏联之货币改革与资本主义国家之货币改革绝然不同，在资本主义国家中，改革结果必然引起消费品价格之巨大上涨，因而减低劳动人民之实际工资，增加失业人数，使战争后果与货币改革之主要负担转嫁于劳动人民身上；而苏联之货币改革，对劳动人民不仅丝毫无损，反之，劳动人民之实际工资将因消费品价格之猛跌而大为增加。此项改革将有助于劳动人民物质福利之增进，有助于贸易之发展，与国民经济之繁荣，并加强苏维埃国家之力量。
