Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu-Wan Frontline, 27th: A frontline reporter reports on the intimate and harmonious relationship between the education community of Xuchang and the People's Liberation Army, saying: After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, Director Liu of the political department of a certain unit personally went to Xuchang Middle School to explain the various policies of the People's Liberation Army and the Outline Land Law. He paid great attention to comforting the teachers and students who were frightened during the fighting. A teacher from Linru Middle School was wounded by the Chiang bandits, and the People's Liberation Army provided treatment. The next day (the 17th), teachers from the entire city held a discussion meeting, attended by more than 150 teachers. During the meeting, many teachers requested that the People's Liberation Army provide them with books and newspapers from the liberated areas to read. On the same day, students from Xuchang Middle School and comrades from the People's Liberation Army held a friendly basketball match. On the 18th, the People's Liberation Army held an exhibition of photographs of the victory in the patriotic self-defense war and books and newspapers from the liberated areas. Students came to visit in an endless stream, and they lingered in front of the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The photographs of "The Annihilation of the Chiang Bandit's Rapid Column in Lunan" and "The Great Victory of Menglianggu" were the most popular. At the request of the education and knowledge circles, the exhibition was extended for three days and moved to the streets. At the exhibition, books such as "On Coalition Government" and "On Protracted War" were borrowed completely. Teachers and students from various schools tirelessly inquired about the education situation in the liberated areas from the comrades of the People's Liberation Army. Students from several county-affiliated primary schools even grabbed the comrades of the People's Liberation Army and asked them to give them stamps from the liberated areas as souvenirs. An educated youth named Qian Shuhua ran away from home and insisted on joining the People's Liberation Army. A student named Li from Xuchang Middle School also requested to join the army. At the celebration meeting for the liberation of Xuchang, a teacher from a simplified normal school, after watching plays such as "Escaping from the Palace of the King of Hell" and "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," exclaimed that the artistic level of the liberated areas was so high that it was far beyond what people in the Chiang-controlled areas could imagine.

　　许昌各学校师生与我军亲密融洽
  　许多知识青年要求参军
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十七日电】前线记者报导许昌教育界与解放军亲密融洽情形称：解放军入城后，某部政治部刘主任曾亲至许昌中学讲解人民解放军各项政策及土地法大纲。对战斗中受惊师生备加抚慰。临汝中学一位教员被蒋匪击伤，解放军代为治疗。第二天（十七日）全市教师即召开座谈会，出席教师一百五十余人。席间许多教师向解放军提出要求供给彼等解放区书报阅读。是日许昌中学学生与解放军同志举行友谊篮球赛。十八日解放军举行爱国自卫战争胜利照片与解放区书报展览会。来往参观的学生，络绎不绝，每至毛主席、朱总司令像前，均恋恋不去。“鲁南蒋匪快速纵队之歼灭”与“孟良崮大捷”照片最受欢迎。在教育知识界要求下，展览会延续了三天，并迁至街头举行。在展览会上，“论联合政府”、“论持久战”等书均被借阅一空，各校教员学生向解放军同志不厌其详的探询解放区教育情况。几个县中附小的学生还拉住解放军同志要求送他们解放区邮票，留作纪念。知识青年钱淑华从家里偷跑出来，一定要参加解放军。许中学生李某等亦要求参军。在解放许昌庆祝大会上，简易师范某教员看了“逃出阎王殿”、“兄妹开荒”等剧后，惊叹解放区艺术水平之高，已远非蒋管区人士所能想象。
