Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 7th. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, various trade unions in the city were successively established with the assistance of the democratic government. There are now more than ten trade unions, including railway, electricity, telephone, ordnance repair, textile, flour, printing, transportation, uniform, brick, and woodworking. Under the leadership of the trade unions, workers are actively carrying out various restoration works. Their common slogan is: "Protect our factories and machinery, and actively prepare for resumption of production!" More than 80% of the electrical workers have voluntarily signed up to join the trade union. Under the slogan of "turning darkness into light," some workers have set out in batches to the Qiaodong area to carry out repairs. The transportation trade union has organized 150 horse-drawn carts, 30 handcarts, and 60 rickshaws, ready for transportation. Members of the sanitation workers' union have begun to clean the streets and toilets. Nearly 10,000 railway workers in Shijiazhuang have joined the trade union, reaching 7,000 people; more than 100 workers have voluntarily joined the vigilante corps, armed with the guns and other weapons they have searched out, and are undertaking the glorious task of protecting the new order of the factory. With the food relief provided by the municipal government, the workers' lives have been initially resolved. Under the leadership of the trade union, the ordnance repair workers actively launched the "donate public property" movement. Li Jingui, a hand grenade worker, has contributed all of his preserved 1,600 jin of saltpeter and sulfur, 200 jin of black explosives, 580 hand grenades, and other large amounts of equipment. The uniform factory vigilante corps has discovered a clothing factory of the 32nd Division, which contains thousands of coats and shoe materials, and thousands of catties of grain. On the 17th, the workers of the Daxing Yarn Factory established a temporary representative meeting, and a total of 34 representatives were elected. The meeting resolved to: establish a trade union, organize a vigilante corps to protect the factory and workshop from destruction by Chiang Kai-shek's planes and enemy agents, and establish a cooperative to help solve the workers' living difficulties. Two people from the Zhengyi Flour Company established a temporary staff union and established ten groups. During the war, the workers of the factory always insisted on protecting the machinery and equipment; after the war, the workers voluntarily carried out sorting and inventory of materials. Under the continuous bombing of the Chiang-American aircraft, the telephone workers still actively persisted in repairing the wires and machines.
