    [This dispatch from our newspaper’s correspondent in Taihang, dated the 15th] With the strong requests of the broad masses behind enemy lines, the local armed forces and militia of Xiuwu and Huojia have twice returned to their hometowns, liberated dozens of villages, re-established guerrilla base areas behind enemy lines, and crushed the counterattacks of over a thousand Chiang bandits from the 38th and 41st Divisions. During the Qin-Bo Campaign in early July this year, except for the isolated strongholds of Xiuwu and Huojia, the vast rural areas of Xiu (wu), Huo (jia), and Wu (zhi) were completely liberated. On August 12th, they were re-occupied by Chiang bandit troops. On the night of the 20th of last month, our Xiu-Huo Column, in coordination with the county militia and government, advanced in multiple routes behind enemy lines, sweeping across dozens of villages in the Xiu, Huo, and Wu triangle area, including Yangyuefeng, Chengfeng, Nanjia, Yaoqiying, and Yangcun. Wherever our troops arrived, the Chiang bandit township offices and local bullies and puppet armed forces were in a state of panic, fleeing at the sight of us. We killed over 50 enemies, captured 96 alive, seized 3 machine guns, 24 rifles, and 2,000 rounds of ammunition. On the 25th, the 366th Regiment of the Chiang bandit 41st Division, in coordination with part of the 38th Division of the puppet Wuzhi Security Regiment, launched a two-pronged counterattack against us, but were defeated by one of our units. The enemy abandoned 22 corpses and fled in a panic. A total of over 50 enemies were killed or wounded, 16 were captured, and 2 machine guns, 9 rifles and carbines, over 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and a quantity of military supplies were seized.
    When the masses heard that their own army had returned, they rushed home from the fields, and the army and people reunited, filled with joy. We immediately announced the distribution of grain and land, as well as a lenient policy towards puppet bao and jia personnel, self-defense corps members, and deceived elements. The masses' struggle sentiment was extremely high, and they actively accused the despots of their atrocities. The Chiang bandits' extortions from the masses were shocking. According to statistics from Chen Di Village for September and October alone, grain and money had been levied three times, with 48 catties of wheat and 10,000 yuan being extracted per mu of land. In addition, conscription was even more serious. After our troops advanced into the area, the Chiang puppet township offices and home return corps members who had fled were too frightened to engage in any activities.

    修获武军民二次打回老家
    重建敌后游击根据地
    歼灭蒋匪百余解放村庄数十
    【本报太行十五日电】修获武地方武装及民兵，在敌后广大群众请求下，二次打回老家，解放村庄数十个，重建敌后游击根据地，并粉碎蒋匪三十八师、四十一师千余人之反扑。今年七月初沁博战役中，除修武、获嘉两孤立据点外，修（武）获（嘉）武（陟）广大乡村全获解放，八月十二日复被蒋匪侵占。上月二十日夜，我修获纵队配合该县民兵、政权，分数路挺进敌后，横扫整个修、获、武三角地带之杨约峰、程封、南贾、姚旗营、杨村等数十村，我军所到之处，蒋匪乡镇公所及土顽伪武装恐慌万状，望风逃窜。我毙敌五十余、生俘敌九十六名、缴机枪三挺、步枪二十四枝、子弹二千发。二十五日，蒋匪四十一师三六六团，配合伪武陟保安团三十八师一部，分两路向我反扑，为我某部击溃，敌遗尸二十二具，狼狈窜回。共毙伤敌五十余，俘十六名，缴机枪二挺、步马枪九枝、子弹二千余发、军用品一部。
    群众听说自己军队返回，纷纷由野外回家，军民重聚，欢欣万分。我当即宣布分粮分田，及对伪保、甲人员、自卫团、上当分子宽大政策，群众斗争情绪极高，纷纷控诉奸霸暴行。蒋匪勒索群众，骇人听闻，仅据陈堤村九、十两月统计，已派粮款三次，每亩地已出麦四十八斤、款一万元，再加上抓丁，更其严重。我军挺进该区后，流亡之蒋伪乡公所还乡团等均已吓得不敢活动。
