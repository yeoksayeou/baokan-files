(Jilu Yu Daily News, 8th) After the concentration of new soldiers in Puyang, the county committee issued a special notice on supporting the army, pointing out that the work of supporting the army is one of the main tasks after the conscription movement. Minor daily life problems of new military families, such as fetching water, weeding, and paving the ground, should be regularly taken care of, and attention should be paid to solving various difficulties. All districts pay close attention to this work. Now, each village in the Sixth District has organized a committee to provide preferential treatment to military families. At the meeting to celebrate the sending off of new soldiers in Cai Wanghe Village, the masses proposed to solve all the difficulties of the military families, ensuring that the military families would not leave an acre of land uncultivated and would not have difficulty getting water. Most of the villages in the Fourth District have organized groups to comfort military families. After learning about the difficulties of the military families during the visits of the comfort group in Wuling Village, they immediately solved them. For a military family member who was in confinement, the women of the comfort group immediately provided her with three catties of cotton and made a quilt, and also made seven pairs of shoes and eight pairs of socks for other military families. Students fetch water for military families every day. The comfort group of Xitaishang Village visits military families in shifts every day, and the village cadres personally fetch water and grind flour for the military families. The military families said, "This is even better than when my son was at home!" The Xiguan team held a forum for military families, which made the military families further understand the reason that life cannot be good without overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek.

　　濮阳群众关心解决军属困难
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】濮阳新战士集中后，县委会特发出优军通报，指出优军工作为参军运动后主要工作之一，对新军属日常生活上的零星问题，如打水、锄草、垫地等，应该固定有人做，要注意解决各种困难。各区对这一工作都很注意，现在六区各村均组织有优待军属委员会，蔡王合村在欢送新战士大会上，群众提出解决军属一切困难问题，保证军属不荒一亩地，吃水不作难。四区大部村庄组织了慰问军属团，武陵村慰问团在慰问中，了解军属的困难后，即马上解决。有一个坐月子的军属，慰问团妇女就马上给他弹了三斤棉花、做了被子等，又给其他军属做了七双鞋，八双袜子。学生每天给军属打水。西台上村慰问团，每天分班到军属家慰问，村干又亲自给军属打水推磨，军属说：“这比俺儿子在家还好哩！”西关组开了军属坐谈会，使军属进一步了解不打倒蒋介石不能好过的道理。
