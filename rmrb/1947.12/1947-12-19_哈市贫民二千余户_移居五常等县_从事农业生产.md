Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th -- The first group of over two thousand three hundred impoverished citizens of Harbin, having received enthusiastic assistance from poor peasant farmers and the democratic government in rural areas, began relocating to Weihe, Wuchang, and other counties in Songjiang Province at the beginning of this month to engage in agricultural production. After deciding on the resettlement locations, each county sent representatives to Harbin to welcome the migrants, conducting in-depth visits to various streets and neighborhoods to inform them of the conditions in their new homes. They were told that upon arrival, the migrants would receive land, firewood would be readily available, and as long as they worked diligently, establishing a stable life would not be a problem. The migrants were very pleased to hear this. Before departure, they held resettlement meetings for days, formulating moving plans and discussing how to engage in agricultural production in the countryside. Various district streets and relatives bid farewell to the migrants, holding send-off gatherings, gifting them with dry food, cotton clothing, cotton hats, and other presents, and screening movies and performing Yangko dances to give them a warm send-off. The Harbin Immigration Committee also specially dispatched cadres, doctors, and nurses to escort them to various counties by train, car, and horse-drawn carriage free of charge. Based on the principle of free association, the migrants formed groups of five households, platoons of twenty-five households, and battalions at the county level, adjusting labor to facilitate mutual assistance in production. Along the way, young adults were responsible for transportation, while young women were responsible for taking care of luggage and the elderly, weak, women, and children. The first group of five hundred and eighty households migrating to Weihe departed from Harbin by train on the evening of the 8th. When they arrived at their destination the next day, the station was already crowded with representatives from the county's farmers' associations, women's associations, children's corps, and militia who had come to welcome them. As the migrants disembarked, the local villagers helped carry children and luggage, warmly arranged for the migrants to board horse-drawn carriages, and guided them to the warm houses and heated kang beds that had been prepared in advance.
