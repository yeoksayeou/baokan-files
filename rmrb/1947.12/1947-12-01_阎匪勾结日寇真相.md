　　The Truth About Yan Bandit Colluding with Japanese寇

　　It has been two and a half years since the Japanese寇 surrendered, but in the small area of central Shanxi, there is still a fully armed Japanese "Imperial Army" co-ruling this Chinese land with the Yan bandits, continuing to massacre and persecute the Chinese people.

　　Since August 1945, when the Yan bandits openly cooperated with the Japanese寇, the Japanese troops in Shanxi have undergone three "reorganizations." Initially, the Japanese army only retreated from some areas to the Taiyuan, Datong, and Zhengtai railway lines, still openly maintaining the appearance of the "Imperial Army," until January 1946, when they began to disguise themselves for reorganization. According to the "Special Compilation No. 2" telegram from the Yan bandit's headquarters to the Japanese "Post-War Liaison Department" on January 12, 1946, which was seized by the People's Liberation Army, it openly stated: "The reorganized Japanese army will be used as demonstration troops for mobile decisive battles in emergencies... They are organized into eight special task forces, serving as guard troops directly under the Second War Zone Commander's Headquarters." Regarding the formation of the special task forces, according to the order "Otsu Collection, Staff 甲 Secret No. 6" of the Japanese army in Shanxi on March 17, it stated: "Each regiment is assigned a Japanese battalion, all of whom are Japanese officers and soldiers. The other two battalions are Chinese, with Japanese serving as instructors. The first regiment is reorganized from the First Brigade, the second regiment from the Fifth Independent Garrison Unit... the seventh regiment from the Second Independent Brigade, and the eighth regiment from the Fourth Independent Garrison Unit." At the same time, a "Railway Guard Team" was established. Because Japanese officers, soldiers, and Japanese nationals were eager to return to their country at that time, the Yan bandits and the main Japanese war criminals in Shanxi, relying on the Yan-Japanese joint special organization HeMou Company, carried out activities among the Japanese army and Japanese nationals with higher treatment to win them over, and spread rumors that "the Eighth Route Army is destroying transportation. If you want to return to your country, you can only join the railway guard team and assist Shanxi in suppressing bandits." At that time, a total of five guard battalions, one civil engineering team, one communication repair team, and one mountain artillery company were established, unified into one general team, with Zhao Chengshou (逆賊) as the commander and Japanese Major General Fujimoto (changed Chinese name to Dong Xiufeng) as the chief of staff. According to Japanese soldier Kakita Tsutomu and others, captured by the People's Liberation Army last March, the battalion commanders were filled by officers of the rank of 佐 or higher, county advisors, and mine police chiefs, etc. The company commanders were filled by former deputy section chiefs of the police department, and the squad leaders were filled by detachment chiefs, etc. The guard team members included personnel from the former North China Transportation Company's police department and general local personnel. The civil engineering team members and communication repair team members included personnel from the North China Transportation Company's engineering department and the electrical stock department of the company, etc. The company commanders were all colonels or lieutenant colonels, the squad leaders and platoon leaders were majors or captains, and the team members were lieutenants or second lieutenants.

　　Last year, the Yan bandits further reorganized the Japanese battalions in the special task forces and the railway guard teams into nine battalions of the "Shanxi Security Force," with Zhao Chengshou (逆賊) as the commander and former commander of the 14th Brigade of the Japanese Army, Minamoto Izumi, as the deputy commander, cooperating with the Yan army to be responsible for guarding key points. The first, third, fourth, and sixth battalions were stationed around Yangqu, the second battalion in Xinzhou, the fifth battalion in Yangquan, and the seventh, eighth, and ninth battalions in Datong. During the Zhengtai campaign in May this year, the fifth battalion in Yangquan, with more than 400 people, was completely disarmed by the People's Liberation Army.

　　After the Zhengtai and Fenxiao campaigns this year, the Yan bandits deeply felt the lack of their mobile forces. In July, they reorganized the Japanese "Security Force" into a field force, established as a division, called the "4173 Unit," directly under the command of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters. The commander was Major General Ueno, and it had five battalions: Bao 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, renamed the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth regiments. According to the Japanese military doctor Tsuyuki Kiyosaku, who recently surrendered to us, the division headquarters is currently stationed outside Xiaodongmen in Taiyuan, and the director of the political department's intelligence department is Ogawa; the first regiment is also stationed outside Xiaodongmen, and the commander is Oda; the second regiment is stationed in Xin County, and the commander is Inoue (former advisor of Wutai County); the headquarters of the third regiment and the third battalion are stationed in the cotton mill in Beiguan, Yuci, the first battalion is stationed in Wangcun, the second battalion is stationed in the Yuanguo power plant, and the commander is Nagatomi; the fourth regiment is stationed in Xishan, Taiyuan, and the commander is Furuya (former advisor of Shijiazhuang City); the sixth regiment is stationed in the oxygen factory in Xishan, Taiyuan, and the commander is Nunokawa. The seventh, eighth, and ninth battalions in Datong were reorganized into the "Datong General Team of the Shanxi Provincial Field Army," with Japanese Colonel Hayashi Yutaka (changed Chinese name to Chen Banshan) as the general commander and Goshi Gyunosuke (changed Chinese name to Wu Wei, former commander of the Japanese Gui Sui Garrison) as the deputy general commander. It has seven, eight, nine, and fourteen infantry battalions and a mechanized battalion. The infantry battalion has three infantry companies and a machine gun company. The commander of the seventh battalion is Sano, the commander of the eighth battalion is Yamauchi, the commander of the ninth battalion is Yoshii, and the commander of the tenth battalion is Ohori. There are 700 Japanese soldiers. Many Chinese soldiers have been added, and the entire team has about 3,000 people.

　　In addition to the Japanese army, there are also a large number of Japanese instructors in the Yan bandit army and military training institutions. According to Ogitsubo Yoshiyuki, a Japanese soldier who surrendered to the People's Liberation Army this year, there are 549 Japanese in the Yan bandit's Provincial Defense Army Training Group in Taiyuan. Among them, the Japanese instructor team has 240 people, and the special training team has 250 people. In addition, there are also a large number of Japanese instructors in the Xishan Training Group's armored team in Taiyuan, and they are responsible for 元泉 Lieutenant General and 赤星 Major General, etc. In the Yan army, there are not only Japanese instructors, but also Japanese serving as commanders. For example, the deputy commander of the 19th Regiment of the Yan Army is Japanese Okada, and the machine gun team is attached to Japanese Taka Shige (already changed Chinese name to Guo Buqing). Ogitsubo once served as the lieutenant deputy company commander of the Provincial Defense Army and carried an appointment letter with "Ji Zi No. 70." According to Tsuyuki Kiyosaku, there are six Japanese soldiers in the Yan bandit's 49th Division, among whom 富田 serves as a lieutenant colonel staff officer in the division headquarters.

　　The Yan bandits serve the Japanese soldiers meticulously, showing everywhere that the Japanese soldiers are still slave owners reigning over the Chinese people. According to Hoshino Hidetoshi, in addition to the Japanese army being promoted by two or three grades according to their original ranks, Japanese soldiers are all lieutenants or second lieutenants, at least warrant officers. The Yan army's families are not given allowances, while the Japanese army's families can receive subsidies. On the food regulation table for March 1947 of the Japanese Army Security Fifth Battalion, Chinese soldiers receive 22.5 jin of corn and 15 jin of millet per month, while Japanese receive 22.5 jin of rice and 13.2 jin of white flour. Japanese also have special rations every month, including 1 jin of salt, 2 jin of soy sauce, 3 jin of soy sauce, 2 jin of dried fish, 2 jin of kelp, 0.5 jin of sugar, 30 packs of cigarettes, 1 bottle of beer, and 10 liang of Japanese sake per person. Japanese residences have water and electricity supply, and Japanese can watch movies for free. In order to prevent the Japanese army from missing their motherland, the Yan bandits found Chinese wives for a large number of Japanese soldiers and officers. There are special pensions and "consolation ceremonies" for those who died in battle. Of course, all these superior slave-owner lives of the Japanese soldiers are gradually being destroyed under the blows of the People's Liberation Army against the Yan-Japanese bandits (according to Yoshida Akira, a Japanese soldier captured by our Jin-Sui Liberation Army, the Japanese soldiers now have to eat sorghum every day and must go out to loot and transport coal themselves).

　　In addition to the Yan-Japanese joint operations, a large number of Japanese soldiers are also distributed in the Yan bandits' various political, economic, cultural, and special agent agencies, and all hold high positions. All these facts fully prove that the United States and Chiang have repeatedly promoted that all the Japanese prisoners and Japanese nationals in China have been withdrawn, which is a complete lie. The Chinese people all know that since the day the Japanese soldiers surrendered, under the instruction of American imperialism, the Chiang-Yan bandits colluded with all the mortal enemies of the Chinese people, including the enemy and the traitors, to form an anti-communist and anti-people allied force to maintain their traitorous dictatorship and enslave the Chinese people. Obviously. The Chinese people will eventually settle accounts with these Chiang-Yan-Japanese war criminals. The date for them to repay this huge blood debt is not far away. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　阎匪勾结日寇真相
    日寇投降已二年半了，但在晋中狭小地区，还有一支全付武装的日本“皇军”与阎匪共同统治着这块中国土地，继续屠杀迫害中国人民。
    自一九四五年八月阎匪公开与日寇合作后，山西日寇曾有三度“改编”，初时日军仅由部分地区收缩至太原、大同正太沿线，仍然公开保持“皇军”面目，直至一九四六年一月始开始伪装加以整编。据解放军缴获之阎匪长官部四六年一月十二日致日本“善后联络部”的“特编字第二号”代电中，即公然称：“整编日军为示范部队紧急时使用于机动决战方面。………编为八个特务团，作为二战区司令长官部直属警卫部队”。特务团的编成，据缴获之山西日军三月十七日“乙集参甲密第六号”命令内称：“每团配属一日本营，全为日兵官兵。另两营为中国人，由日人任教官，一团由第一旅团改编，二团由第五独立警备队改编，……七团由独立第二旅团改编，八团由独立第四警备队改编”。同时又有“铁道护路队”的成立。因当时日军官兵及日侨归国心切，阎匪与山西日主要战犯，乃依当时阎日联合特务组织合谋社在日军与日侨中活动以较高的待遇拢络，并造谣“八路军破坏交通，要想归国只有参加护路队，协助山西剿匪”。当时共成立五个护路大队，一个土木工程队，一个通讯抢修队，一个山炮中队，统一为一总队，由赵逆承绶兼司令，日人藤本（改华名董秀峰）少将任参谋长，据去年三月解放军俘虏之日军柿田勤等供称：各大队长由佐级以上军官、县顾问、矿山警务队长等充任，中队长由前警务段之副段长充任，小队长为分遣所长等充任，护路队员有原华北交通公司警务系的人员及一般地方人员，土木工程队员及通讯抢修队员有华北交通公司工务系人员，及该公司电气股人员等。中队长的官阶都是上校或中校，小队长分队长是少校或上尉，队员是中尉或少尉。
    去年，阎匪又进一步将留晋日寇特务团中之日本营与铁道护路队，统一整编为“山西保安队”九个大队，由赵逆承绶兼司令，原日军第十四旅团长元泉馨任副司令，协同阎军担负守备要点之责。一、三、四、六大队驻阳曲一带，二大队驻忻州，五大队驻阳泉，七、八、九大队驻大同。今年五月正太战役，阳泉之第五大队四百余人，曾全部被解放军缴械。
    今年正太、汾孝两战役后，阎匪深感其机动兵力缺乏，七月乃将日军“保安队”又改编为野战部队，建制为一个师，称“四一七三部队”，直接受太原绥署指挥。指挥官为上野少将，辖保一、二、三、四、六五个大队，改称一、二、三、四、六团。据日前向我投诚之日军军医露木清作供称：该师师部现驻太原小东门外，政治部情报主任为小川；一团亦驻小东门外，团长为小田；二团驻忻县，团长为井上（原五台县顾问）；三团团部及三营驻榆次北关纺纱厂，一营驻王村，二营驻源涡发电厂，团长为长富；四团驻太原西山，团长为古屋（原石门市顾问）；六团驻太原西山酸素工厂，团长为布川。在大同的七、八、九大队则改编为“山西省野战军大同总队”，总队长为日人林丰大佐（改华名陈半山），副总队长为五味牛之助（改华名武威，原日寇归绥警备队长），下辖七、八、九、十四个步兵大队与一个机械化大队。步兵大队下辖三个步兵中队及一个机炮中队，七大队长佐野，八大队长山内，九大队长吉井，十大队长尾壕。共日兵七百外。补充中国兵亦甚多，全总队共约三千人。
    除日军外，阎匪军及军事训练机关中更有大批日本教官，据今年向解放军投诚之日军荻坪义幸称：在太原之阎匪省防军集训团中，即有日人五百四十九人。内日本教官队二百四十人，特训队二百五十人。其余太原之西山训练团机甲队等，亦有大批日本教官，并由元泉中将及赤星少将等负责。阎军中则不只有日本教官，且有日人任指挥官。如阎军第十九团副团长为日人冈田，机枪队附为日人高重（已改华名郭步青），荻坪即曾任省防军之中尉副连长，并携有“集字第七十号”任命状一纸。又据露木清作称：阎匪四十九师则有日军六人，其中富田于师部任中校参谋。
    阎匪对日寇的供奉无微不至，处处表现着日寇依然是君临中国人民头上的奴隶主。据星野秀敏说：除日军按其原阶级提升两三级外，日兵皆为中尉、少尉，至少是准尉。阎军家属不发给养，而日军家属则可领得津贴。日军保安五大队之民国三十六年三月份粮食规定表上，中国兵每月为包米二十二斤半，小米十五斤，日人则为大米二十二斤半，白面十三斤二两。日人每月尚有特殊配给，包括每人盐一斤，酱二斤，酱油三斤，干鱼二斤，海带二斤，糖半斤，烟卷三十盒，啤酒一瓶，日本酒十两，日人住宅有水电供给，日人可免费看电影。阎匪为使日军不怀念祖国，为大批日兵与日军官找中国老婆，战死尚有特别抚恤与“慰灵祭”。当然，日寇这一切优越的奴隶主生活，已在解放军对阎日打击下日趋破灭（按：据被我晋绥解放军俘获的日寇吉田晃供称，现在日寇已每日不得不吃高粱，必须自己步行出外掠夺，搬运煤炭）。
    除了阎日共同作战外，大批日寇同样分布在阎匪的各种政治、经济、文化以及特务机构中，且均高踞要职。这一切事实，完全证明过去美蒋一再宣传中国日俘、日侨业已全数撤尽一点，乃系漫天大谎。中国人民全都深知，自日寇投降之日起，在美帝国主义授意下，蒋阎匪帮即勾结一切中国人民的死敌，包括敌寇汉奸，组成反共反人民的同盟军，以维持其卖国独裁统治，奴役中国人民。显然。中国人民最后必将一起清算这批蒋阎日战犯。他们偿付这一大笔血债的日期已是不远了。（新华社）
