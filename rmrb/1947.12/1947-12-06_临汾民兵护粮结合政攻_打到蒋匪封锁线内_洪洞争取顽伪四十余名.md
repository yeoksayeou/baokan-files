　　Taiyue, 4th of this month—This newspaper reports: During the Linfen Fourth District militia's grain protection campaign, combined with political offensives, on November 6th and 7th, they repelled the Yan bandits after they looted grain in Lianli Village. On the 18th, they proactively moved into the East and West Wang Villages within the Chiang-Yan blockade line, driving away the puppet village government and repelling a part of the Chiang bandit's 204th Regiment reinforcements. Then, they posted propaganda and painted slogans in the East and West Wang Village area. On the 20th, they held a mass meeting in the East and West Konghe area to publicize the news of the great counter-offensive victory. They also encountered a part of the enemy's 204th Regiment, consisting of more than 200 people, in Dongwang Geduo. After our brave assault, the Chiang bandits were routed and fled. On the 21st, in coordination with the Hongdong Expeditionary Force, they ambushed the bandit's heart, Xin Zhuangdian. The next day, the Yan bandits set out in different directions to loot grain. When their vanguard entered the ambush circle, we fired our guns and bullets together, repelling them, capturing four bandits, and seizing four rifles. On the night of the 23rd, we once again moved into the West Wang Village and Goulishang within the bandit blockade line, capturing four Yan bandit informants and one plainclothes member of the 204th Regiment.
　　This newspaper reports: The new areas of Hongdong Chengguan Railway Line and the Lin-Hong border are launching a political offensive against the enemy. In order to expand the results, the comrades in the county decided to establish a separate political offensive team, absorbing village cadres from this area to participate, because these people are familiar with the masses and have social connections, and the masses are not afraid to tell the truth. At the beginning of the work, they first went through the basic masses to understand the situation of the puppet and stubborn personnel, and investigate how these people got in, whether it was long-term or short-term? As officials or soldiers? Volunteered or forced? ... Then, they learned about the composition of their families, their personal thoughts, whether they were die-hard or timid and wanting to escape. According to preliminary statistics, there are a total of 175 stubborn households in each village. In addition to holding general mass meetings in various villages to publicize the great counter-offensive, they then went deep into the homes of stubborn family members or held individual talks, using the method of talking about the situation and explaining the pros and cons. According to different situations, they patiently persuaded them, explaining that our policy is lenient and that turning back is the shore. But shells don't have eyes and won't be lenient. Those who don't come back are willing to die with Chiang Kai-shek. Many stubborn family members have had their thoughts broken through. One stubborn old man said to us: "Now I know my son has gone the wrong way!" One basic member, whose son was forced by the village to serve in the stubborn service team, personally went to the service team to call him back, complaining that his son did not return. In just over ten days, he successively won over eight stubborn personnel who returned, and another six or seven were preparing to return. More than thirty students escaped back from Chengguan.

　　临汾民兵护粮结合政攻
    打到蒋匪封锁线内
    洪洞争取顽伪四十余名
    【本报太岳四日电】临汾四区民兵护粮战中，结合政治攻势，于十一月六、七两日，击退阎匪在联里村抢粮后，又于十八日，主动活动到蒋阎封锁线内之东西王村，将伪乡村公所打跑，并击退了蒋匪二○四团一部援兵。然后就在东西王村一带张贴宣传品，涂写标语。二十日，又在东西孔河一带召开群众大会，宣传大反攻胜利消息。又在东王圪垛与敌二○四团一部二百余人遭遇，经我奋勇冲击，把蒋匪打得落荒而逃。二十一日，又配合洪洞远征队，设伏于匪之心脏辛庄店，第二天阎匪分路出发抢粮，待其尖兵进入伏击圈内时，我即枪弹齐发，将其击退，并俘匪四人，缴步枪四枝。二十三日夜，我再次活动到匪封锁线内的西王村、沟里上，抓回阎匪情报员四名，二○四团便衣一名。
    【本报讯】洪洞城关铁路线、临洪边界等新区正向敌展开政攻，县里同志为了扩大成绩，决定单独成立一个政攻小组，吸收本地区村干部参加，因这些人和群众熟悉有社会关系，群众不害怕敢说实心话。工作开始时，是先经过基本群众，了解伪顽人员的情况，调查这些人是怎么进去的，是长期的还是短期的？当官还是当兵？自投的还是逼迫的等。……然后再了解他们家庭的成份，个人的思想，死心塌地的或者胆小逃跑的。据初步统计各村顽属共一百七十五户。除一般的在各村召开群众大会宣传大反攻外，接着就是深入顽属家中或个别谈话，以讲形势说利害的方式。根据不同的情况，耐心劝解，说明我们的政策是宽大的回头是岸。但是炮弹没长眼窝，不会宽大。不回来的人就是甘心和蒋介石一块儿死。有很多的顽属思想被打通了。一个顽属老汉对我们说：“现在才知道我儿走错了路啦！”有一基本群众，他的儿子是被村里强迫送到顽服务队当兵，他就亲自到服务队去唤，埋怨他儿子不回来，十几天的工夫先后争取回来的顽方人员有八名，还有六七个也准备回来，城关逃回的学生就有三十余人。
