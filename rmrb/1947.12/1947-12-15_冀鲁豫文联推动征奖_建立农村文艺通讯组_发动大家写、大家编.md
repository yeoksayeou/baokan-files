	JiluYu Federation of Literary and Art Circles Promotes Submissions and Awards
	Establishes Rural Literary and Art Correspondent Groups
	Mobilizes Everyone to Write and Edit
	[Report from our JiluYu Office] Since November 1st, the JiluYu Federation of Literary and Art Circles, jointly with Pingyuan Literature and Art and Xin Di Pictorial, has launched a "Submission and Award" campaign with a prize of 200,000 yuan, calling for the expansion of writing and painting activities. The scope of submissions is broad, including popular works in folk forms (such as clapper talks, folk tunes, stories, lotus ballads, scripts, news, etc.), works by artists (such as "zhuizi," "yangqin" tunes, "yangpian" lyrics, propaganda posters, and "gaodiao" operas, etc.), and literary works (such as poetry, novels, reportage, and dramas, etc.). In just one month since the launch of the campaign, over a hundred manuscripts and dozens of paintings have been received. To respond to this movement and strengthen editing work, comrades from various associations of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles have formed three editing groups and gone to the countryside to participate in land reform work, face the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and strive to reflect reality. They have also established rural literary and art correspondent groups in the districts and villages they visit, mobilizing everyone to write and paint. Many primary school teachers, rural cultural workers, and artists who previously dared not write or paint have now taken up their pens. Comrades from the Federation of Literary and Art Circles are experimenting with writing works in new chapter novels, popular poetry, "zhuizi," "gaodiao" operas, lotus ballads, and clapper talk forms that the masses can sing, perform, and understand. On December 1st, the district party committee transferred more than seventy cultural and educational assistants and primary school teachers from various counties to establish a rural literary and artistic work training class, with the Federation of Literary and Art Circles responsible for professional guidance, with the aim of training rural cultural cadres and improving blackboard newspapers, radio broadcasts, rural drama movements, singing, and other work, so that the budding literary and art can be developed on a large scale.
