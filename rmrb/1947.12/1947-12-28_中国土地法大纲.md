The farmers' association shall prohibit anyone from arbitrarily slaughtering livestock, cutting down trees, destroying farm tools, water conservancy, buildings, crops, or other items, and engaging in theft, seizure, private gifting, concealment, burial, dispersal, and sale of these items for the purpose of hindering fair distribution; violators shall be subject to the trial and punishment of the people's court.

　　Article 15: In order to ensure that all measures in the land reform conform to the interests and will of the overwhelming majority of the people, the government is responsible for effectively guaranteeing the democratic rights of the people, ensuring that peasants and their representatives have full power to freely criticize and impeach all cadres at all levels at various meetings, and have full power to freely remove and elect all cadres in the government and farmers' organizations at various appropriate meetings. Those who infringe upon the above-mentioned democratic rights of the people shall be subject to the trial and punishment of the people's court.
