　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: New York dispatch: U.S. bigwigs and merchants are making speculative deals amidst soaring prices, causing prices to rise even more uncontrollably. According to the New York Times on the 14th, the United States is experiencing a severe steel shortage, and since 40 percent of industries rely on steel as a raw material, a large-scale black market for steel has emerged in New York. At least two thousand people are engaged in this black market speculation, making huge profits by selling at prices three to four times higher than the official prices. Government officials are also participating in this speculation. For example, Truman's compensation problem advisor, California oil magnate Pauley, is engaged in large-scale food speculation. With speculative merchants stirring up trouble, U.S. prices have risen to new peaks. According to the conservative Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of December, the wholesale price index for all goods has risen to a new high of 161 (with 1926 as 100), a sharp increase of about 30 percent compared to the same period last year. The bureau's aforementioned index was 157.1 in mid-June and 158.1 in late September.

　　美国今年物价涨百分之三十
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】纽约讯：美国达官巨商在物价飞腾声中，正大做其投机生意，致使物价更如脱缰之马。据纽约时报十四日载称：美国由于钢料奇缺，而工业中百分之四十又以钢为原料，以致纽约现已发现有广大之钢黑市，从事此项黑市投机者至少有两千人，他们以高于公开价格三、四倍之售价，牟取巨利。政府官员亦有参加此项投机者，如杜鲁门之赔偿问题顾问加州大油商鲍莱，即从事大笔粮食投机。在投机商人兴风作浪之下，美国物价已涨至新的顶峰。据保守的劳工统计局公布，截至十二月份为止，一切货物之批发价格指数已涨至一六一（以一九二六年为一百）的新高度，较去年同期猛增百分之三十左右。该局上述指数在六月中旬为一五七点一，九月下旬为一五八点一。
