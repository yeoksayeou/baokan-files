　　Machang Iron and Wood Workers Mutual Aid
　　Earning 450,000 Yuan in Half a Month
　　[Report from our Lucheng correspondent] After the autumn harvest in Machang, blacksmiths Gao Yongkui and Han Anbao observed that over thirty hired poor workers in the village were not organized for mutual aid, making it difficult for them to find substantial work and often unable to secure even small jobs. Consequently, they collaborated to organize mutual aid among the village workers. To address the shortage of funds, they also accepted a commission from the military industry department to manufacture twenty large carts, priced at 200,000 Yuan each, receiving an initial payment of 2 million Yuan. This greatly boosted everyone's morale. On December 1st, fifteen ironworkers and fifteen woodworkers began mutual aid, establishing a cart repair and manufacturing factory. The profit distribution was tentatively set at 20/80 (80% for the workers, 20% for capital). The iron and wood workers formed five large groups, with one group specializing in odd jobs and the other four groups focusing on repairing and manufacturing large carts. They have now been formally working for half a month, manufacturing two large carts with a net profit of 140,000 Yuan, repairing sixteen large carts with a net profit of eight shi of grain, and earning a net profit of 150,000 Yuan from odd jobs, totaling a net profit of 450,000 Yuan. In the future, they will be able to manufacture one large cart every two days, earning a net profit of 70,000 Yuan. The workers live, work, and rest together, and their morale is very high. Woodworker Bai Wantang said, "With mutual aid, we don't have to worry about furniture materials. There are also rewards for those who do more work and do it well, so who wouldn't work hard?"
