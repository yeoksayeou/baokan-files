Some Opinions on Winter Production Loans
Shuang Qing, Yun Ting

I. Examining Our Class Line Through Loan Inspections:

(1) In past loan inspections, due to a lack of clarity regarding the class line for loans, inspections generally focused on the impact of the loans, the amount of private capital involved, and the intended use of the funds. Insufficient attention was paid to the class background of the borrowers, leading to a serious deviation from the pro-poor peasant and farm laborer line in lending practices. For example, in Nanhui Mountain Village in Lincheng County, out of a total of 240,000 yuan in loans, households targeted for struggle received 100,000 yuan. In Buyao Village, out of 219,000 yuan in loans, two old middle peasant households received 130,000 yuan, averaging 65,000 yuan per household, while 15 poor peasant and farm laborer households received 89,000 yuan, averaging just over 5,000 yuan per household. In Liang Village, out of 315,000 yuan in loans, ten old middle peasant households received 180,000 yuan, one household that was targeted for struggle received 10,000 yuan, and eight poor peasant and farm laborer households received only 125,000 yuan. In Changfeng Village in Neiqiu County, out of 150,000 yuan in loans, three old middle peasant households received 46,000 yuan, averaging over 15,000 yuan per household, while 13 poor peasant and farm laborer households received 104,000 yuan, averaging 8,000 yuan per household. In Zhijiao Village, out of 72,000 yuan in loans, two middle peasant households received 41,000 yuan. From the above, it is clear that the bias in our lending practices is significant.

(2) In the past, in order to stimulate the masses to organize and engage in production, it was proposed that loans should be given to organized groups such as mutual aid teams and weaving groups. However, whether this approach aligns with the class line needs further examination. For example, in a group led by Wang Jia Hui and Wang Kui Xian in Lincheng, out of a total of eight members, seven were households targeted for struggle, and one was a middle peasant, receiving 20,000 yuan in loans. The Wang Xue group received 20,000 yuan in loans, of which households targeted for struggle accounted for two, middle peasants three, and poor peasants one. According to a survey of Dongdong, in eight weaving groups, middle peasants accounted for 19 members, and poor peasants and farm laborers accounted for 15, receiving 94,000 yuan in loans. In eleven men's mutual aid groups, middle peasants accounted for 28 members, and poor peasants and farm laborers accounted for 18, receiving 117,700 yuan in loans. Generally, the profit-sharing method in these groups is based on work points. For example, in three weaving groups in Dongdong, middle peasants received 340 work points, while seven poor peasant and farm laborer households received 190 work points. In three men's mutual aid groups, middle peasants received 232 work points, while eight poor peasant and farm laborer households received 120 work points. The above situation shows that middle peasants not only make up the majority in the groups, but also receive the majority of work points, even including some households targeted for struggle. This requires us to carefully examine the composition of mutual aid groups to ensure that loans truly serve the production needs of poor peasants and farm laborers.

(3) Lending through cooperatives (credit cooperatives) has undoubtedly achieved considerable success in some respects, but oversight cannot be relaxed. For example, in the Fourth District of Neiqiu, 5 million yuan in supplementary loans were issued this winter through cooperatives, but after inspection, it was found that apart from a few villages where loans were given to the masses, most of the funds were taken by the cooperatives for commercial production. In Qiaojiazhuang Cooperative in Lincheng, 100,000 yuan in loans were also used for cooperative turnover. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect whether cooperatives are serving the poor peasants and farm laborers.

II. What are the Reasons for the Non-Poor Peasant and Farm Laborer Line?

The main reason for these shortcomings is the lack of clarity regarding the class line for loans. For example, the emphasis on the purpose and duration of the loan makes some poor peasants and farm laborers afraid of not being able to repay it on time, and they dare not boldly apply for loans. If it is stipulated to buy livestock, the poor peasants and farm laborers cannot afford it, which suits the needs of the middle peasants. Although the loan term does not necessarily require repayment on time, the poor peasants and farm laborers do not understand this. It can be said that our loan "methods" have not allowed the poor peasants and farm laborers to truly grasp and understand them. In addition, the emphasis on combining with floating capital in loans favors the middle peasants who have more floating capital. Therefore, in the future, we must use a class perspective to improve our loan work.

III. How to Correct the Bias in Loans?

(1) We should first start with poor peasants and farm laborers to conduct loan inspections, and carry out mass loan inspection work with poor peasants and farm laborers as the backbone. If it is found that households targeted for struggle have used loans, they should be immediately recovered. Middle peasant loans should be persuaded and mobilized to be recovered as much as possible, so as to first meet the loan requirements of poor peasants and farm laborers.

(2) If the members of a mutual aid group are all poor peasants and farm laborers, loans can be given to the group as a unit. Otherwise, loans should be given to poor peasants and farm laborers individually, who can then combine their loans with the capital of middle peasants and engage in mutual aid production.

(3) Loans should be given through cooperatives, but inspections should be carried out to establish the idea that cooperative cadres serve poor peasants and farm laborers, or to transform the leadership composition of the cooperatives. Finally, I propose that our village cadres in the district should seriously conduct loan inspections with the idea of solving the financial difficulties of poor peasants and farm laborers.

    对冬季生产贷款的几点意见
    双庆、云亭
    一、从检贷中看我们的阶级路线：
    （一）过去检查贷款中，由于对贷款的阶级路线不明确，所以在检查贷款中，一般的是看贷款的作用大小，私资多少，用途怎样。贷款户成份注意不够，以致形成了贷款中严重的非贫雇路线。例如临城南灰山全村贷款二十四万元，斗争对象五家贷款十万元。补要村贷款二十一万九千元，贷给老中农二户款十三万元，每户平均六万五千元，雇贫十五户贷款八万九千元，每户平均五千多元。梁村贷款三十一万五千元。老中农十户贷款十八万元，被斗一户贷款一万元，贫雇八户贷款才占十二万五千元。内邱常丰村贷款十五万元，老中农三户贷款四万六千元，每户平均一万五千余元，贫雇十三户贷款十万零四千元，每户平均八千元。支角村贷款七万二千元，中农二户即贷去四万一千元。从以上可以看出我们贷款中的偏向是很大的。
    （二）过去贷款，为刺激群众组织起来进行生产，这样也曾提出贷款应贷给有组织的如互助组、纺织组等，但从阶级路线来看是否对头尚须研究。例如临城王家辉、王魁贤组统计，共八人，被斗户即占七人，中农一人，贷款二万元。王学组贷款二万元，其中被斗户占二人，中农三人，贫农一人。据东洞的调查，纺织组八个，中农占十九人，贫雇占十五人，贷款九万四千元。男人互助组十一个、中农占二十八人、贫雇占十八人，贷款十一万七千七百元。而这些组一般的分红办法均是按工票计算的、例如东洞三个纺织组统计，中农八人得工票三百四十分，贫雇七户得工票一百九十分，男互助组三个，中农八人得工票二百三十二分，贫雇八人得工票一百二十分。以上情况可以看出，中农不仅在组内占多数，而分票也同样占多数，甚至里边包括一部被斗户。这样就须我们认真进行检查互助组的成份，作到贷款真正为贫雇生产服务。
    （三）通过合作社贷款（信用社），在好的一方面当然取得了不少成绩，但另一方面也不能放松检查。例如内邱四区，今冬通过合作社补贷五百万元，但经检查，除少数村庄贷给群众外，大部被合作社拿去作了商业生产，临城乔家庄合作社贷款十万元，也都用到合作社周转，因此，必须检查合作社是否为贫雇服务。
    二、非贫雇路线的原因在那里：
    产生这些缺点的原因，主要由于贷款的阶级路线不够明确，如：贷款强调用途，强调期限，使得有些贫雇怕到期还不了，而不敢大胆贷款，如规定买牲口，贫雇买不起，适合了中农要求，贷款期限虽不是到期非还不行，但贫雇是没有体会了这一点，这也可以说我们的贷款“办法”，没有让贫雇真正掌握与了解。另在贷款中强调结合游资，但中农游资多，结合了游资，即贷给了中农，因此，今后我们必须以阶级的眼光，去改进我们的贷款工作。
    三、如何纠正贷款中的偏向问题。
    （一）应首先从贫雇入手进行贷款检查，开展以贫雇为骨干的群众性的检查贷款工作。在检查中发现被斗户占用贷款者，应马上收回。中农贷款应根据实际情况，说服动员，尽量收回，首先满足贫雇贷款要求。
    （二）互助组贷款，如组内都是贫雇，可以组为单位贷款，否则应贷给贫雇个人，贫雇拿上贷款，再去结合中农资金，结合互助生产。
    （三）通过合作社贷款，但应进行检查，树立合作干部为贫雇服务的思想，或改造合作社领导成份。最后提议我区村干部，应以为解决贫雇生产资金困难的思想，去认真进行检查贷款。
