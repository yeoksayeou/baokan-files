    The Masses of Luzhai Cherish Soldiers, Warriors Can Head to the Front Lines with Peace of Mind
    [Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 14th] After 113 young and strong men from Luzhai Village, Hua County, signed up to join the army, the masses actively prepared to give preferential treatment to military families. Village cadres held meetings to discuss and decided to ensure that the new soldiers would have no worries. Women cadres proposed helping military families make clothes, shoes, and socks, and specifically calculated the future production and life of each family member. Qian Yuting, the head of the poor peasant group, said: "People are shedding blood and risking their lives on the front lines. In all conscience, we should take extra care of military families." Fang Yunzhang stated that if military families had any problems, no matter morning, noon, dusk, or midnight, even if they came ten times a day, he would not find it troublesome. The father of old military family member Qian Shaozan said with emotion: "If anyone has no conscience and doesn't need care, give me a few more military families to take care of. I guarantee I'll fetch water for them." Zhang Jinli volunteered: "Shouzhen has joined the army, and there's no one at home. I guarantee I'll help him fetch water, sweep snow, and repair any collapsed walls or houses at any time." At the village's preferential treatment meeting, the masses unanimously proposed: "Going to the front lines means leaving home and sacrificing the small for the sake of the large. Anyone with a conscience should take care of military families, actively engage in production, and not just make empty promises." Each street and mutual aid group automatically vowed: "We would rather go hungry ourselves than let military families suffer." Women also said: "If military families are sick or giving birth to children, we guarantee we will cook and take care of them, serving them as attentively as our own family members." Therefore, the new soldiers were also reassured. They swore to the masses at the meeting: "We are determined to fight Old Chiang when we get to the front lines, obey orders and not violate discipline, not desert, and not return to Luzhai Street until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown." They also proposed mutual competition and inspection between the front and rear, and signed a three-way contract. On the 29th, the whole village enthusiastically saw off the new soldiers, who went to the district to gather with smiles.

    路砦群众优军好
    战士放心上前线
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】滑县路砦村一百一十三名青壮年报名参军后，群众积极酝酿优军，村干开会商量，决心使新战士心里没挂牵。妇女干部提出帮助军属做衣服、鞋、袜，并具体合算了每个家属今后的生产和生活，贫农组长钱玉亭说：“人家上前线拼命流血，凭良心对军属应加照顾。”方云章表示军属有了事，不管早晨、上午、黄昏、半夜，一天找十趟，保险不嫌麻烦。老军属钱少赞的父亲感动的说：“谁没良心，我不用照顾，再分给我几家军属，我保管给挑水吃。”张进力自报说：“守真参军，家里没人，我保险帮他打水、扫雪、墙倒屋塌随时修盖。”在全村优军大会上，群众一致提出：“上前线离家、舍小为大家，有良心就得照顾军属，积极生产，光空口说话不为凭。”各街各互助组自动立誓：“自己挨饿也不叫军属作难。”妇女也说：“军属有病或生养小孩，俺保证做饭侍候周到，和自己人一样端尿盆。”因此，新战士也放了心，他们在大会上向群众宣誓说：“去前方决心打老蒋，服从命令不犯纪律，不开小差，不打倒蒋介石不回路砦街。”又提出前后方互相竞赛检查，订立下三连单。二十九日，全村群众欢送新战士，新战士欢笑着到区去集合。
