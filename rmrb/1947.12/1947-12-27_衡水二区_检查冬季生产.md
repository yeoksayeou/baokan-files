　　Hengshui Second District
  　Inspects Winter Production
    [This newspaper's Jinan dispatch from the 25th] The Hengshui Second District convened a joint meeting of district cadres to inspect the achievements and shortcomings in organizing sideline production in the past six months. Of the 83 natural villages in the district, 75 have established cooperatives. Most of the masses in the villages have moved from calculating accounts by household to focusing on production. For example, the writing brush and ink workshops, oil presses, cotton ginning, and weaving industries in Dongkaihe Village and Wangxuzhuang, the comb workshops and improved spinning carvers' workshops in Kangjiayao, and the sugar workshops and cart transportation industries in Kangxinzhuang have solved many livelihood difficulties for poor peasants. The active sideline production in these villages is partly due to the historical situation of limited land and a large population (many poor peasants) and the foundation of handicraft industry, but mainly because the leading cadres are from poor families and understand the difficulties of poor masses during the spring famine. Shortcomings include: an inspection of the 60 weaving rooms in the district revealed that poor peasants accounted for a minority except in the aforementioned seven villages, the leadership of village cadres was also insufficient, and there were also villages where the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households did not have enough food to eat, had no strength or means for production, and were worried about not being able to survive the spring famine, eagerly hoping that cadres would solve their problems. From this, they deeply realized that in the past, they were only satisfied with the form of production and the small number of achievements obtained, and did not experience the difficulties of poor peasants in production. After research, it was decided to make a major change in work style, and everyone expressed their attitude to organize the production of poor masses, braving the snow to go deep into the countryside.

　　衡水二区
  　检查冬季生产
    【本报冀南二十五日电】衡水二区召开区干联席会，检查半年内组织副业生产中的成绩与缺点，全区八十三个自然村，已有七十五村建立合作社，各村群众从按家算帐中，大部走向生产。如东开河村及王许庄的笔墨作坊、油坊、弹轧、纺织业，康家窑的篦子作坊、纺线改良车木作铺，康辛庄糖坊、大车运输业，这些生产，解决了贫农不少生活困难。这几村的副业生产活跃，一方面是由于历史上地少人多（贫农多）有手工业基础，主要是由于领导干部为贫民，了解贫苦群众的春荒困难。缺点方面：全区六十个纺织窨子，检查除上述七个村子外，贫农占少数，村干领导的也不够，还有的村老弱孤寡户粮食不够吃，生产无力量无办法，愁着春荒过不去，渴望干部去解决。由此深刻认识过去只满足于生产形式和获得的少数成绩，而没体验到贫农生产中的困难。研究后决定在作风上大转变，个个表明了自己要组织贫苦群众生产的态度，冒雪深入了农村。
