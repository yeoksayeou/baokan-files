Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th. The Northeast Administrative Committee, in order to vigorously implement streamlining and savings, and to fully support the front lines, recently issued measures for economizing during the New Year holidays, stipulating that during both the old and new Lunar New Years, frontline combat troops will receive New Year's expenses of one *jin* of pork and three meals of fine grain per person; rear-area organs and troops will receive half a *jin* of pork and two meals of fine grain (the rear-area organs of all troops are the same). All units, except for their own mess halls and when troops invite nearby residents to eat, are not allowed to host, give gifts, or entertain in any other way, and are even more strictly forbidden from accepting gifts from the common people. Violators will be treated as engaging in waste and corruption. In addition to organizing evening parties, all organs and troops are not allowed to put on plays or mobilize the masses to organize *Yangge* dance teams, so as to avoid wasting manpower and resources and hindering work.

　　东北政委会通令
  　过年不得浪费
  　不准请客送礼招待
    【新华社东北二十七日电】东北行政委员会，为厉行整编节约，全力支援前线，顷颁发过年节约办法，规定各部队机关在新旧两次年节中，前方战斗部队发过年费每人猪肉一斤，细粮三餐；后方机关部队发猪肉半斤，细粮两餐（各部队后方机关同）。各单位除自己会餐，部队可邀请就近居民吃饭外，不准其他请客、送礼及招待等，更不准接受老百姓礼物，违者将以浪费与贪污论。各机关部队除组织晚会外，不准另外演戏及动员群众组织秧歌队，以免浪费人力物力，妨害工作。
