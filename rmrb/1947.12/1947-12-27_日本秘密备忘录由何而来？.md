　　What is the Origin of the Japanese Secret Memorandum?
    The revelation by "World Report" weekly of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's "outrageous" demands regarding the peace treaty with Japan is not surprising. These arrogant demands are the inevitable result of the U.S. imperialists' consistent support for Japanese reactionaries after the war. Since MacArthur has spared no effort to protect the reactionary forces in Japan, the so-called Allied powers' non-interference in Japanese politics directly implies the open resurgence of Japanese militarism. The absence of controls on Japan's foreign trade, and the maintenance of a four million-ton merchant fleet (equivalent to the pre-July 7th Incident tonnage), means the restoration of Japan's economic aggression in East Asia and its competition in the world market. Unrestricted production, and the retention of islands such as South Sakhalin, the Kuriles, Ryukyu, and Ogasawara, signifies the preservation of Japan's military aggressive potential and military bases for foreign expansion. Armed police also means the barbaric and bloody suppression of the democratic forces of the Japanese people by the old Japanese rulers.
    It has been less than two and a half years since Japan's surrender, yet it has already become so rampant. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for this. If the U.S. had not violated the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements by implementing a unilateral policy of sole control over Japan; if MacArthur had not merely issued some empty directives on the surface, while actually supporting the reactionary forces in Japan, allowing them to continue to rule behind the scenes; if the U.S. did not regard Japan as its "industrial factory in East Asia," as an experienced broker for U.S. monopoly capital to exploit the people of China and Southeast Asian countries; if the U.S. did not use Japan as a "strategic springboard" against the Soviet Union; if the U.S. were not opposing the four-power veto and considering a separate peace treaty with Japan; in short, if U.S. imperialism were not betraying its promises and attempting to tear up the important agreements that laid the foundation for world peace, attempting to dominate the world, then the Japanese reactionaries would never have dared to make such "outrageous" demands.
    Regarding the peace treaty with Japan, is there not some degree of understanding and tacit agreement between Japan and the U.S.? Are the Japanese reactionaries' outrageous demands not due to some kind of instigation from the American reactionary MacArthur himself? This cannot but raise suspicion. Not long ago, the dispute in the Japanese cabinet caused by the dismissal of Rikizo Hirano, and the turmoil in the parliament over the nationalized coal mine bill, concealed a conspiracy by the Japanese reactionaries led by Kijuro Shidehara and Shigeru Yoshida—the large financial clique and bureaucratic group—to attempt to overthrow the cabinet and dissolve the parliament, in order to seize the opportunity to re-emerge and seize power. This conspiracy is not unrelated to the U.S. announcement that a peace conference with Japan will be held next year; these ambitious reactionaries want to come to power themselves so as to attend the conference and obtain peace terms that are more favorable to them. They understand that as Chiang Kai-shek, this incompetent American slave, faces collapse, the American reactionaries' need for them is increasing daily. Therefore, they have become even more "outrageous." It is not that "Japan will try to alienate the U.S. and the Soviet Union," but that the U.S. policy of supporting Japanese reactionaries and its imperialist policy of attempting to dominate the world have brought about such a memorandum.

### 日本秘密备忘录由何而来？

　　日本秘密备忘录由何而来？
    “世界报导”周刊揭露了日本外务省关于对日媾和的“放肆”的要求，这消息并未引人惊异，这种狂妄的要求正是美帝国主义者战后一贯扶植日本反动派的必然结果。麦克阿瑟既然竭力保护了日本的反动势力，所谓盟国不得直接干涉日本政治，就意味着日本军国主义之公开的重新抬头。日本对外贸易不受管制，和保有四百万吨的商船队（即七七事变前的吨数），就意味着日本对于东亚经济侵略和在世界市场上的竞争之恢复。生产不受限制，以及保持南库页岛、千岛、琉球、小笠原群岛等岛屿，就意味着日本军事侵略潜力和对外扩张的军事基地之保全。武装警察也意味着旧日本统治者对于日本人民民主势力之野蛮的血腥的镇压。
    日本投降还不到两年半，就居然猖狂起来，这完全应由美国政府负责。如果美国不违反雅尔塔、波茨顿协议，实行片面的单独对日管制政策；如果麦克阿瑟不是仅仅表面上发布一些空洞的训令，而实际上却扶持日本的反动势力，让他们在幕后依然统治；如果美国不把日本当作其“东亚的工业工厂”，当作美国独占资本榨取中国和南洋各国人民的有经验的经纪人；如果美国不把日本作为反苏的“战略跳板”；如果美国不是反对四强否决权，并在考虑对日单独媾和；总之，如果美国帝国主义不是背信弃义企图撕毁奠定世界和平基础的重要协议，企图独霸世界；那末，日本反动派断然不敢提出这样“放肆”的要求。
    关于对日和约，日美之间难道没有某种程度的谅解和默契吗？日本反动派的放肆的要求，难道不是由于美国反动派麦克阿瑟自己的某种授意吗？这是不能不令人怀疑的。不久以前日本内阁中以平野力三去职问题引起的纠纷，以及议会中争论国营煤矿法案的风波，幕后隐伏着以币原、吉田为首的日本反动派——大财阀大官僚集团企图倒阁与解散议会，以便乘机重新出面执掌政权的阴谋。这个阴谋又和美方宣称明年召开对日和会不无联系；这班反动派的野心家，想自己上台，以便出席和会，取得对他们更加有利的媾和条件。他们懂得，当蒋介石这个无能的美国奴才面临崩溃的时候，美国反动派对于他们的需要便与日俱增。因此，他们便更加“放肆起来”，不是“日本将试图离间美苏”，而是美国扶助日本反动派的政策，和企图独霸世界的帝国主义政策才招来了这样一个备忘录。
