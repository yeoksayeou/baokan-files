*Taiyue Xinhua Daily* Editorial Calls for Seizing the Time to Lead Winter Production
[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 30th] The *Xinhua Daily* here published an editorial yesterday entitled "Seize the Time to Lead Winter Production," which stated in part:

The Three Autumns campaign is over, and winter production should be promptly carried out. Due to the largely poor harvests in our region during the summer and autumn seasons, and the dying struggle of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs to seize grain, a spring famine in certain areas is inevitable next year. Because of the leap month this year and an early spring next year, the start of spring plowing will also be early, so the time for winter production is not long. The former indicates that winter production is not only an essential path for some areas with good harvests to achieve "cultivate three, surplus one," but more importantly, it is the fundamental key to supporting the front lines and overcoming the spring famine. The latter indicates that in leadership, winter production must seize every moment, organize all kinds of labor, including men, women, full and part-time labor, in the gaps between participating in the war and land reform, and intensify efforts without missing any opportunity.

How should it be carried out? First, it should be recognized that this year's widespread poor harvests make winter production even more important than in any previous year. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the mentality of waiting (for participation in the war, re-examination, loans) and complacency among some cadres and the masses, and to strengthen the leadership of the masses, change the past perception of agricultural slack season, and establish the concept of "busy winter" this year. This is a concrete test of the mass viewpoint and serving the masses, and should not be taken lightly or ignored in the slightest. On the mass side, we must overcome the situation of making little money from spinning and weaving, no sales for transportation, and "could afford to eat but not wear last year, can afford to wear but not eat this year," and not give in to difficulties. We must recognize that "running around gets you full, walking to eat is always better than sitting and eating," and also recognize that: the long view must be taken, a small stream must flow for a long time, and although spinning and weaving make little money, they can both keep you warm and feed you. We must use the method of calculating the year to make up for the losses, and break through the paralyzed thinking of cadres and the masses. In areas with good harvests (such as Changzi and Tunliu), we must put forward the slogans "better and better," "good agriculture and good sideline occupations," and "achieve cultivate three, surplus one," and overcome complacency. Regarding spinning and weaving raw materials, transportation funds, it should be basically solved by absorbing idle funds and small-scale transportation from the masses, and overcome the "waiting" mentality.

Second, winter production should be carried out with a center and focus. To implement leadership, each county, district, and village should, in addition to determining the center and grasping the key points according to local production conditions, say that throughout our region, this winter should focus on spinning and weaving, and transportation. In spinning and weaving, we must launch the "ten catties of cotton" campaign, implement the slogan "every household spins cotton, groups organize cloth," and in particular, we should generally pay attention to technology, improve tools, and improve quality. Spinning women and weaving women should maintain an appropriate proportion, develop separately as needed, complete the call to "organize 50% of women aged twelve to fifty," and carry out the spinning and weaving movement widely and on a large scale.

In terms of transportation, we should actively call on the masses to organize transportation and sales, open small cooking shops, large donkey and horse shops, with convenient forage, rice and noodles, and advocate the style of "look small for profits, think for the masses who carry burdens," to solve the problem of transportation food and lodging. On the other hand, industry, commerce, trade, banks, and cooperatives should have basic points for setting up warehouses and promote "transaction transportation introduction offices" to overcome the difficulty of "goods dying at the destination," to facilitate the smooth flow of materials.

Regarding the production of essential handicrafts, in addition to our region being self-sufficient, the general requirement is to improve quality and organize exports. The region's native cloth, Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Gaoping's iron goods, as well as salt, mountain goods, medicinal materials, etc., should all actively find ways to open up sales channels. Regarding woolen fabrics, cotton fabrics, towels, and paper, we should actively reward, exchange experiences, organize and carry out competitions and visits, so as to learn from each other and improve quality. In addition, organizing the masses to open up trade routes in the Northwest (Northwest Shanxi, Shaanxi, Suiyuan and Mongolia), exporting large quantities of native cloth, and exchanging for large numbers of livestock can not only solve the sales of cloth, but also overcome the difficulty of livestock in agriculture.

Third, in order to overcome the spring famine and prepare favorable conditions for spring plowing, in addition to grasping production, we should also carry out thrift and fertilizer accumulation. We should learn from the Qinyuan Production Committee's call for the "three accumulation movement" and overcome the style of extravagance and waste. We must implement slogans such as "coarse vegetables for half a year's food, prepare to overcome the spring famine," "one donkey dung egg, one bowl of millet rice," and "accumulate firewood and charcoal in winter, reduce spring plowing difficulties."

Finally, in terms of leadership, it must be truly unified, and at the same time, it must be based on hiring the poor as the backbone, implement the mass line, proceed from the most urgent needs of the masses according to different local conditions, organize banks, cooperatives, etc., lead the masses, help the masses solve specific problems, prevent administrative orders and the formalism of mutual aid groups, and at the same time, use methods such as role models and meritorious service to launch competitions to mobilize the masses. On the other hand, only by truly mobilizing the masses to overcome the "paralysis and waiting" mentality and truly recognizing the importance of winter production can a mass production movement be created. In short, we must seize the time to lead winter production, and overcome the two deviations of laissez-faire and doing everything for the masses.

### 太岳新华日报社论号召  抓紧时间领导冬季生产

　　太岳新华日报社论号召
    抓紧时间领导冬季生产
    【本报太岳三十日电】此间新华日报昨日以“抓紧时间领导冬季生产”为题，发表社论，略谓：
    三秋运动已过，冬季生产即应抓紧进行。我区由于夏秋两季大部歉收，蒋阎匪帮垂死抢粮，造成明年一定地区的春荒。由于今年闰月明春春浅，又决定了春耕开始要早，冬季生产时间不长。前者说明冬季生产不仅是某些年成好的地区实现“耕三余一”所必经之途，而更重要的是支援前线克服春荒的基本关键；后者说明，冬季生产在领导上必须抓紧一切时间，在参战、土改空隙中，组织男女全半及其他各种劳力，不放松任何机会去加紧进行。
    怎样进行呢？首先应该认识，今年普遍歉收，冬季生产比过去任何一年就更加重要，因此必须克服某些干部与群众中的等待（参战、复查、贷款）、松懈歇一歇的思想，加紧领导群众，转变过去农闲的认识，建立今年“冬忙”的观念。这是群众观点与为群众服务的具体考验，不应该丝毫麻庳和忽视。在群众方面要克服纺织赚钱少、运输没销路以及“去年吃起穿不起，今年穿起吃不起”向困难低头的情形，我们要认识“跑一跑饱一饱，走吃总比坐吃好”，还要认识：日子要长算，细水要长流，纺织虽然赚钱少，既可穿暖又吃饱。要用算年成补窟窿的办法，打通干群麻庳思想，在年成好的地区（如长子、屯留），要提出“好上加好”、“农业好副业好”、“实现耕三余一”的口号，克服自满情绪。关于纺织原料运输资金，基本上应从群众中吸收游资与点滴运输来解决，克服依靠“等待”的观点。
    其次，要有中心、有重点的去进行冬季生产。贯彻领导，各县区村除根据当地生产条件，确立中心，掌握重点外，在我全区说，今冬以纺织、运输为中心，纺织上要展开“十斤花”运动，贯彻“家家纺花、组组织布”的口号，尤其应该普遍注意讲究技术，改良工具，提高质量。纺妇织妇要保持适当比例，根据需要分别发展，完成“组织妇女十二至五十岁百分之五十”的号召，普遍的大量的开展纺织运动。
    在运输方面，应积极号召群众组织运输运销，开设起火小店、驴马大店，草料方便，米面俱全，倡导“利要看小，为担挑群众着想”的作风，解决运输食宿问题。另一方面，工商、贸易、银行、合作社，应有基点的设立货栈，推广“交易运输介绍所”以克服“货到地头死”的困难，便于物资畅流。
    关于手工业必须品的生产，除我区自给自足外，一般要求提高质量，组织出口。全区之土布，晋（城）、阳（城）、高（平）之铁货，以及食盐山货，药材等，均应积极设法打开销路。关于毛织、棉织、毛巾、纸张，均应积极奖励、交流经验，组织开展竞赛、参观，借以互相观摩提高质量。此外，组织群众打通西北（晋西北、陕西、绥蒙）贸易路线，大量输出土布，换回大批牲口，这不但可以解决布的销路，而且克服了农业上牲口困难。
    再次，为克服春荒、准备春耕有利条件，除抓紧生产外，还应该进行节约积肥，应学习沁源生产委员会“三积运动”的号召，克服铺张浪费的作风，我们要把“糠菜半年粮，准备渡春荒”、“一颗驴粪蛋，一碗小米饭”、“冬季积柴炭，春耕少困难”等口号贯彻下去。
    最后，在领导上要确实一元化起来，同时要以雇贫为骨干，贯彻群众路线，根据各地不同条件，从群众最迫切的需要出发，把银行、合作社等都组织起来，带领群众、帮助群众解决具体问题，防止行政命令与互助组的形式主义，同时要运用表模立功展开竞赛等办法，把群众动员起来。另一方面，只有真正动员群众克服“麻庳、等待”思想，切实认识冬季生产重要，才能造成群众性的生产运动。总之，我们对冬季生产要抓紧时间进行领导，克服放任自流与包办代替的两种偏向。
