　　Huainan Chiang Kai-shek Bandits' Tyranny is as Fierce as a Tiger
    Exorbitant Sums for Public Funds and Conscripted Labor
    People's Families Ruined and Living as if in Hell
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th] The Shanghai Observer Weekly, Volume 3, Issue 11, published a Huainan dispatch, describing the various miseries of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas of Huainan. The article stated: "Since the breaching of the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou in the 27th year of the Republic [1938], the Yellow River's waters flooded into the Huai River, and the fields and villages of Huainan were submerged. When the water receded in winter, the remaining houses were on the verge of collapse, and the fields were covered in yellow sand, desolate beyond measure. This year, after the closure of Huayuankou, farmers moved back to cultivate the land; however, they lacked plowing cattle and seeds. Some farmers borrowed seeds at high interest rates, but they were hit by floods. Shou County, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, and Xuyi counties have become extensive disaster areas again. Although the northern bank of the Huai River embankment was barely built, the southern bank was blocked by a certain Sun, a "National Assembly representative" from Anhui Province (of the Chiang bandits), because the construction of the southern embankment required a new road to be built through Sun's private land, so Sun obstructed it, causing a huge disaster in this year's autumn floods. The levies and exactions of the (Chiang bandit) townships have not been washed away by the floodwaters; farmers who have harvested nothing still have to pay taxes as urgently as possible. The (Chiang bandit) county government, the special commissioner's office, and passing troops, every organ wants something, with numerous items, such as 'Civil Servant Living Subsidy,' 'Veteran Living Expenses,' 'Office Expenses,' 'Entertainment Expenses,' etc. The average monthly tax per mu of land in rural public funds alone is 20,000 yuan (in Chiang currency). The so-called 'Entertainment Expenses' are for the (Chiang bandit) township government to welcome and send off 'officials' and to contact local gentry. Each 'entertainment' always involves lavish feasts with meat and fish for three days. When the township thugs (bandit gang henchmen) cannot find a single grain or blade of grass in the farmers' homes, they take the person to 'see the blockhouse,' lock them in the bunker, and starve and beat them. The family has to ask the gentry to intercede for their release and are given a deadline to pay the money, even if it means selling their sons and daughters, they must pay off this '阎王帳' [Yama's debt, i.e., an inescapable debt]. Recently, the (Chiang bandit) townships and bao [neighborhood watch units] are conscripting soldiers and officially spending money to buy 'vagrants' to fill the quota. The method of substitution is that each conscript costs 5 million yuan at market price. Each time conscription occurs, each household has to pay more than 100,000 yuan. After these purchased conscripts are 'inspected,' the Chiang bandit receiving organs often take money from the conscripts' families to buy their release, and then arbitrarily arrest people in the countryside, creating chaos. Predatory land annexation is proceeding rapidly. Zhang Ziyan, the manager of the Chiang bandit Huainan Coal Mine, has already acquired hundreds of mu of land. (Chiang bandit) military officers and bureaucrats stationed elsewhere also often use the ill-gotten gains they have extorted to buy land. Nowadays, many poor farmers in the Huainan countryside dare not stay at home, lock their doors, and the whole family flees. It is estimated that about one-third of the rural population in Huainan has been forced to leave their homes due to (Chiang-created) floods, apportionments, and conscription. Many refugees are forced to work as coolies in the Huainan Coal Mine of (Chiang bandit) bureaucratic capital. The miners' wages are only 8,000 yuan per shift, and the foreman has to exploit 2,000 yuan. They usually have to be careful to please the foreman, and if they are slightly displeasing, they will be fired. The mine shafts, which are dozens of zhang [1 zhang = 3.3 meters] deep, often collapse, burying miners alive. The number of miners buried alive in a single incident is as high as dozens, and the (Chiang bandit) mine only provides a coffin for burial. Families are only given 200,000 to 300,000 yuan as so-called 'compensation'. Huainan under (Chiang bandit) tyranny has become a living hell.

　　淮南蒋匪苛政如虎
    公款壮丁费动辄十余万
    人民家破人亡如居地狱
    【新华社陕北三十日电】沪观察周报三卷十一期载淮南通讯，叙述淮南蒋区人民的种种惨状。该文称：自民国二十七年花园口黄河堤，黄水入淮，两淮田园庄屋，尽被淹没；冬日水落，残屋欲倒，田里尽是黄沙一片，荒凉异常。今年花园口合龙后，农民迁回耕种；但缺乏耕牛、种子，有的农民借高利贷购买种子，但却遭水灾。寿县、凤台、怀远、凤阳、盱眙诸县又成广泛灾区。建筑淮河堤防，北岸虽勉强筑成，但南岸则被（蒋匪）皖省“国大代表”孙某所阻，因修南堤须筑新道通过孙某私人土地，孙某遂横加阻挠，致今年秋泛酿成巨灾。（蒋匪）乡里的摊派苛捐并未为洪水带去，毫无收获的农民还必须偿付急如星火的征敛。（蒋匪）县府、专署、过往军队，任何机关都要，名目繁多，有什么“公务员生活补助费”、“荣兵生活费”、“办公费”、“招待费”等，单单乡村公款平均每月每亩地就要摊上（蒋币）两万元。所谓“招待费”是（蒋匪）乡公所对“官长”送往迎来，联络各方士绅而用的。每次“招待”，总是大鱼大肉盛筵三日。收款的乡丁（匪帮爪牙）在农民家里搜不出一粒粮、一根草时，便把人带去“看炮楼子”，关在碉堡里一饿二打，家属只好找士绅说情放出来，限日交钱，那怕是卖儿卖女，也要还清这“阎王帐”。近来（蒋匪）各乡保征壮丁官行花户筹款买“游民”。抵充的办法，每名壮丁时价五百万元，征集一次，每家花户要摊出十余万元。这些买来的壮丁“验收”后，蒋匪接受机关又常常得壮丁家属的钱予以买放，再到乡间任意抓人，弄得鸡飞狗跳墙。掠夺式的土地兼并急剧地进行着，蒋匪淮南煤矿经理张子晏竟已置地数百亩之多。（蒋匪）旅外军官和官僚也常把搜刮的黑心钱买地。如今淮南农村多少穷苦农民不敢在家存身，把门一锁，全家流亡。估计淮南农村因（蒋造）水灾，摊派抽丁等而被迫弃家出走的约占农村人口三分之一。很多流亡者被迫跑到（蒋匪）官僚资本之淮南煤矿做苦工，矿工每工工资仅八千元，而工头要剥削去两千元。平时更须善秉工头的眼色办事，稍不适意，就会被开除。深达数十丈的窑洞，常有塌倒活埋矿工的惨剧发生，被埋矿工一次多至数十人，（蒋匪）矿方仅给一付棺材葬殓。有家的也只给二、三十万元所谓“抚恤”了事。（蒋匪）苛政下的淮南，已成人间地狱。
