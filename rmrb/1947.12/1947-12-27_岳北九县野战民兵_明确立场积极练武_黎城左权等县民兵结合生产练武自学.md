　　Yuebei Nine Counties' Field Militia
  　Clarify Standpoint, Actively Practice Martial Arts
  　Licheng, Zuoquan and Other Counties' Militia Combine Production with Martial Arts and Self-Study
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th dispatch] The field militia companies of nine counties in the Yuebei sub-district have successively carried out large-scale winter military training, further improving their political and military qualities. The martial arts training surge involves 52 field militia companies from nine counties including Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, Zhaocheng, Qinyuan, Anze, Tunliu, and Changzi, totaling approximately 6,000 people (Qinxian not included in the statistics). All counties have universally proposed: during the rectification and training, the first priority is to enable the militia to take a step forward politically, focusing on the education of various basic policies, clarifying the class standpoint, and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Militarily, the focus is on familiarizing themselves with company tactics, nighttime operations, guard duty, sentry duty, ambushes, blocking warfare, basic knowledge of air defense, aiming and shooting, and grenade throwing and explosions. Organizationally, on the 18th of this month, the first branch of the Military Commission instructed all counties that during the rectification and training, the following should be achieved: (1) Members who belong to the targets of struggle must be completely purged, establish a core of poor hired peasants, and establish an activist group. The leadership must pay attention to cultivating the activism of poor hired peasants; (2) Cadres of squads, platoons, and companies who do not separate from production must all be appointed from among the poor hired peasants, especially fugitive soldiers and cadres must be completely purged; (3) Retired cadres and honorably discharged soldiers, because these comrades' physical strength does not meet the requirements of field operations, must be mobilized to leave the field company and let them take on other work; (4) Those who are unwilling in the field company, or who only hold the name and do not do practical work, must also be resolutely purged. This instruction has begun to be implemented in the companies. Each county has formulated a plan to achieve results in the entire martial arts training movement within 20 days.
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 25th dispatch] The militia of Yushe, Licheng, Zuoquan and other counties, in order to improve combat skills and better support the southward advance of the large army, have universally launched a martial arts self-study movement combined with winter production. The content of the martial arts training is all currently urgently needed skills such as shooting, grenade throwing, bayonet fighting, air defense, camping, utilizing terrain and ground objects, guarding prisoners, and rescuing wounded soldiers on the front line. The militia of all villages in Licheng have formed martial arts training groups according to various production natures, formulated plans, and carried out martial arts training. The militia of Cheyuan Village returned from participating in the war in northern Henan, deeply feeling that their combat skills were not proficient enough, hindering them from killing more enemies. Thirty-two militiamen immediately organized three martial arts training groups and opened three martial arts training grounds. They got up before dawn to throw grenades and aim. Each group proposed competition conditions: new militiamen throw grenades 40 meters, and old militiamen are no more than 3 meters away from the target. They are determined to learn how to disassemble and assemble rifles, recognize parts, and learn to use terrain while cutting firewood or transporting goods in the mountains during the day. The militia of Sancangou Village have the greatest enthusiasm for martial arts training and the best integration with production. The slogan is: go wherever you go, practice wherever you practice. When resting from cutting firewood, they use carrying poles as guns to aim and throw stones as grenades, and practice air defense; at home, they study how to bury mines while grinding tofu. Zhao Huzi injured his right arm throwing grenades, so he used his left arm to throw. Han Jiude never leaves his grenades, going wherever he goes and throwing wherever he throws. Li Shuangxi has increased his throw from 26 meters to 30 meters and learned how to bury mines. The militia of Shui'ao Village in Zuoquan proposed "Practicing martial arts doesn't eat at home, production makes money to get rich". Twenty-one militiamen were all organized to transport coal to Wencheng, resting once every seven days and practicing martial arts at home. Zhang Lichang from Shecheng in Yushe said: "We poor hired peasants must not only learn how to fight, but also improve our culture." Under his leadership, 40 militiamen have learned an average of 10 new characters each. Jia Huzi didn't know a single character in the past, but now he has recognized more than 80 characters. The militia of Xiahuancun in Licheng established a literacy class, stipulating that they learn whatever they do, and launched a literacy competition. Currently, martial arts training is being carried out on a large scale. In order to make martial arts training more in-depth and widespread, the Second Sub-district Military Commission and the Military Commissions of Licheng and other counties have issued instructions, pointing out that because a large number of militiamen have joined the army, and a large number of young and middle-aged people have joined the militia, martial arts training is even more important. During martial arts training, attention should be paid to discovering and cultivating the activism of poor hired peasants. When practicing martial arts, honorably discharged soldiers and experienced old militiamen should be hired as teachers.
