Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 15th: The Shijiazhuang Garrison is currently engaged in a "check discipline, check thought" campaign. Director Zhou of the unit emphasized to all officers and soldiers that they should attach great importance to construction work and not allow any destruction. At the same time, they should promote the glorious tradition of hard work and frugality of the people's army and oppose corruption and hedonistic thinking. After entering the city, there should be no change in eating, clothing, or living compared to before entering the city. Establish a clear understanding that "workers and poor people are the masters of the house" and help them to turn over. All officers and soldiers must rigorously examine, criticize, and struggle against all acts of destruction, violations of discipline, and certain corrupt and hedonistic thoughts, and formulate concrete plans to abide by discipline and mobilize the masses. During the inspection, some soldiers confessed to thoughts of "strolling around" and "picking up sheep bones" (meaning picking up bargains) after entering the city. For example, Liu Chunhai, a soldier from the first company of a certain unit, wanted to exchange his grain coupons and vegetable money for better food. Sun Lianji, a soldier from the same company, said, "There's so much white flour in the warehouse, why do we keep eating millet and suffering this foreign hardship?" With everyone's help, these soldiers' thinking has undergone a great transformation. They corrected the erroneous idea that "committing minor violations of discipline after entering the city is nothing." Individual cadres of some agencies confessed to buying cheap goods, "picking up sheep bones," and tending towards extravagance after entering the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 15th: Revolutionary order in Yuanshi urban area has been quickly established. After the democratic county government entered the city with the army, it immediately mobilized the people in the city and surrounding areas to clear away the traces of war and investigate disaster victims to provide relief. During the siege, our army, while annihilating the bandit Wei Yonghe, made every effort to protect the lives and property of the people. When the Wei bandits retreated from the outer city to the inner city, they coerced the people of the outer city to enter the city. When our army entered the western outer city, seeing that the people's property and furniture were scattered everywhere, our army immediately strictly protected them, and no one was allowed to move any of the people's lost property without authorization. Therefore, the restoration of the city's appearance was extremely rapid. The citizens highly praised our army's good discipline.

    反对腐化享受思想
    元氏城区建立革命秩序
    【新华社晋察冀十五日电】石庄警卫部队正展开“查纪律、查思想”运动。该部周主任向全体干部战士强调提出，应高度重视建设工作，不准丝毫破坏，同时发扬人民军队艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，反对腐化享受思想。入城后，在吃穿生活上不准与入城前有所改变，树立明确的“工人贫民当家作主”思想，帮助他们翻身。全体干部战士必须对一切破坏与违反纪律及某些腐化享受思想，进行严厉检查、批评与斗争，并订出遵守纪律，宣传组织群众的具体计划。在检查中，部分战士检讨出入城后之“游逛”、“拣羊骼”（意即拣便宜）思想。如某部一连战士刘春海将粮票菜金要出换好的吃，该连战士孙连计说：“仓库存那么多白面，为什么还净吃小米干饭，受这个洋罪。”在大家帮助下，这些战士思想有很大转变。纠正了一般同志入城后“犯点小纪律，没有什么”的错误观念。个别机关干部检讨出入城后买便宜、“拣羊骼”与趋向奢侈的现象。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十五日电】元氏城区革命秩序已迅速建立，民主县政府随军入城后，立即发动城内与城关人民，扫除战争遗迹，调查灾民进行救济。此次攻城战中，我军一面歼灭魏匪永和，一面全力掩护人民的生命财物。魏匪由城关退入城内时，曾将城关人民胁迫入城。我军攻入西关，见人民之财物家具到处散失，我军当即严加保护，所有人民散失财物均不准擅动。故市容恢复极为迅速。市民非常称赞我军良好纪律。
