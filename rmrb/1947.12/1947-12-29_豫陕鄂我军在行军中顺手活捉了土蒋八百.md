Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 26th: A front-line reporter, Di Qian, reports: While en route to the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army swept through local Chiang Kai-shek forces. In three days and three nights of marching, fighting as they went, they annihilated 800 local Chiang Kai-shek soldiers at the cost of only three minor injuries. The vanguard of the head unit arrived at Sanchiaotang Town, Jia County, on the night of the 11th and captured the bandit village chief, Li Shilin, and 138 others. The next night, while marching to the Xiang (Cheng) Xu (Chang) highway, the Chiang bandit Lushan Security Regiment, which was fleeing north, mistook our troops for Chiang's army. They approached intimately, and when we shouted "Disarm or die!" more than 200 people obediently laid down their weapons. On the 13th, they surrounded the Xiangcheng Security Regiment near Fancheng Town, near Xuchang. As soon as the fighting started, the enemy scattered and fled. Three telephone operators from a certain regiment fired a shot and shouted two sentences, and 38 members of the security team surrendered. Feng Lairou, a cook from a certain regiment headquarters, carried an oil load into a village to find a place to cook and captured five Chiang bandit grooms, five horses, and seven boxes of ammunition. The cook squad of a certain battalion headquarters, led by Quartermaster Wu Zhian, and with the cooperation of several participating militiamen, disarmed a police station of 46 people. Three communications soldiers from the unit went to the railway to deliver a letter and captured eight scattered artillerymen and a complete mortar at the station. In total, they captured 798 local Chiang Kai-shek soldiers alive in three days, seized five artillery pieces of various types, eight machine guns of various types, 662 rifles and carbines, and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. We suffered only three minor injuries.
