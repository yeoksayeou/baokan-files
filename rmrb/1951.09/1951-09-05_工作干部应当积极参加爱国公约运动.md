This issue of our journal publishes an article written by Comrade Huang Zheng, the factory director of the Lüda Jinzhou Textile Factory, titled "Patriotic Public Agreements Improved My Leadership Work." The central idea of this article is: working cadres should actively participate in the patriotic public agreement movement to improve their leadership work and lead the masses forward under the banner of patriotism. The author, based on his own experience and the experience of other leaders in the Jinzhou Textile Factory in formulating and implementing patriotic public agreements, points out: "Facts prove that the patriotic public agreements of leading cadres are not only a powerful weapon for improving leadership work, but also directly affect the patriotic public agreement movement of the masses. Therefore, leading cadres should not only formulate patriotic public agreements, but also formulate them well, implement them well, and check them strictly, so as to set an example for the masses." We believe that these opinions are entirely correct and should be followed in all regions.

Currently, the leading organs and working cadres in many places attach importance to the work of leading the people to formulate and implement patriotic public agreements. The leading organs and working cadres in many places, including those of the Chinese Communist Party, other democratic parties, the People's Government, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and other groups and institutions, not only actively lead the people they are connected with to formulate and implement patriotic public agreements, but also personally participate in the formulation and conscientiously implement patriotic public agreements. It is by relying on their exemplary role and active leadership in the patriotic public agreement movement of the masses that patriotic public agreements have been rapidly promoted among the broad masses of the people and have played a huge role in promoting the advancement of various reforms and construction work. However, there are still some leading organs and working cadres in some places and units who do not sufficiently recognize the significance of promoting patriotic public agreements and adopt a laissez-faire or perfunctory attitude towards the leadership of this work. Some leading organs and working cadres of the Party, government, and Youth League believe that the formulation and implementation of patriotic public agreements is a matter for ordinary people, and they only need to direct and urge others to formulate and implement patriotic public agreements, as their own patriotism is "not a problem"; therefore, they exclude themselves from the patriotic public agreement movement, believing that there is no need to promote patriotic public agreements in the departments they manage, nor is there a need to formulate and implement patriotic public agreements themselves. Obviously, this view is completely wrong. This association's "Call for Promoting Patriotic Public Agreements, Donating Aircraft and Artillery, and Giving Preferential Treatment to the Families of Martyrs and Soldiers" issued on June 1 this year clearly pointed out that the formulation and implementation of patriotic public agreements is a long-term self-education movement for all the people, and there should be no so-called exceptions; because this document emphasized: "We suggest that all people from all walks of life, all factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, streets and rural areas, all workshops, production groups and study groups in factories, all production mutual aid groups and study groups in rural areas, all work departments in institutions, all departments or classes and groups in schools, and even all families and other production and work units, formulate specific patriotic public agreements or amend the original agreements according to their own business, centering on the Resist America, Aid Korea movement; and elect leaders and establish a regular leading core to lead everyone to realize these agreements." The People's Daily editorial published on June 2 this year, entitled "Widely Formulate and Conscientiously Implement Patriotic Public Agreements," further pointed out that Communist Party members, Youth League members, and staff members of the People's Government should not only formulate and implement patriotic public agreements, but also "should play a leading and exemplary role in the formulation and implementation of patriotic public agreements."

Some leading organs and working cadres in some places and units have shown a tendency of detachment from the masses and coercion, not only in other work, but also in patriotic movements (including the movement to promote patriotic public agreements). The ideological source of this tendency lies in the fact that the working cadres of these organs do not recognize that any revolutionary and construction undertaking is the cause of the people themselves, and must rely on the conscious, active and joint efforts of hundreds of millions of people; it lies in the fact that these comrades mistakenly believe that the success of the revolutionary and construction undertaking depends on the special merits of one or a few people, and therefore they think that they can override the masses and use coercive methods to promote work, instead of being willing or knowing how to rely on the masses and use propaganda and persuasion methods to promote work. Therefore, the formulation and implementation of patriotic public agreements will be a good medicine to cure their shortcomings of detachment from the masses and coercion. Doing so will help them truly understand the necessity of promoting work through propaganda methods, strengthen their mass viewpoint, and make them understand that they must never detach themselves from the masses.

Some working cadres of the People's Government and the Party's local organizations, especially working cadres of economic departments, have developed a paralyzing thought that the world is already peaceful and a decadent tendency of not asking about politics after the basic victory of the People's Liberation War. The results of political tests held in some places have proved that the understanding of the situation and the current political struggle of ordinary working cadres of some higher-level organs is not as good as that of district-level cadres, and that district cadres are not as good as rural cadres and activists among the masses, and the understanding of economic work cadres is the worst. Therefore, it is obvious that first educating and leading working cadres to formulate and implement patriotic public agreements can help the Party and the People's Government to overcome the erroneous tendency of some working cadres not asking about politics, so that the effect of the Party and the government's leadership work can be fundamentally improved and the accelerated development of various tasks can be promoted.

### 工作干部应当积极参加爱国公约运动

    工作干部应当积极参加爱国公约运动
    本刊本期发表了旅大金州纺织厂厂长黄正同志所写的“爱国公约改进了我的领导工作”一文。这篇文章的中心思想，就是：工作干部应当积极参加爱国公约运动，借以改进自己的领导工作，并在爱国主义的大旗下领导群众向前进。作者根据自己以及金州纺织厂其他领导人员订立和执行爱国公约的经验指出：“事实证明，领导干部的爱国公约，不但是改进领导工作的有力武器，而且它直接影响群众的爱国公约运动。因此领导干部不但要订立爱国公约，而且要订立得好，执行得好，检查得严，以作群众的榜样。”我们认为，这些意见是完全正确的，各地都应该这样做。
    目前许多地方的领导机关和工作干部，对于领导人民订立和执行爱国公约的工作是重视的，许多地方的领导机关和工作干部，包括中国共产党的和其他各民主党派的、人民政府的、中国新民主主义青年团的以及其他团体、机构的领导机关和工作干部，不但积极地领导他们所联系的人民群众订立和执行爱国公约，而且亲自参加订立并身体力行地贯彻执行爱国公约。就是依靠他们在人民群众的爱国公约运动中的模范作用和积极领导，爱国公约已在广大人民中迅速推广起来，并且发挥了推动各项改革和建设工作前进的巨大作用。但是仍然有一些地方和一些单位的领导机关和工作干部，对推行爱国公约的意义认识不足，对于这个工作的领导采取放任或敷衍的态度。有些党的、政府的和青年团的领导机关和工作干部，认为订立和执行爱国公约，这是普通老百姓的事情，自己顶多只要指手划脚地去督促别人订立和执行爱国公约就行了，至于自己的爱国，那是“不成问题”的；因此他们就把自己列在爱国公约运动之外，认为既不必在自己管理的部门中推行爱国公约，自己也不必订立和执行爱国公约。显然，这种意见是完全不对的。今年六月一日本会“关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召”曾经明确地指出，订立和执行爱国公约是一个全体人民的长期的自我教育运动，不应该有所谓例外；因为这个文件曾经强调地说：“我们建议全国所有各界人民、各工厂、企业、机关、学校、街道和农村，工厂中的各个车间、生产组和学习组，乡村中的各个生产互助组、学习组，机关中的各个工作部门，学校中的各个院系或班、组，以至各个家庭和其他各种生产工作单位等，都按照自己的业务，围绕着抗美援朝运动，订出具体的爱国公约，或增订原来的公约；并且选出领导人，建立经常的领导核心，领导大家来实现这些公约。”人民日报在今年六月二日发表的题为“广泛订立并认真执行爱国公约”的社论，并曾进一步地指出：共产党员、青年团员和人民政府的工作人员不但应该订立和执行爱国公约，而且“应该在订立和执行爱国公约中起带头作用和模范作用”。
    有些地方和单位的领导机关和工作干部，不但在其他工作中，而且就是在爱国运动（包括推行爱国公约的运动）中也表现了一种脱离群众的强迫命令的倾向。这种倾向的思想根源在于这些机关的工作干部不认识任何革命和建设事业都是人民群众自己的事业，都必须依靠千百万群众的自觉的积极的共同努力；在于这些同志错误地认为革命和建设事业的成功是依靠他们一个人或少数人的特殊功劳，因而他们就以为自己可以凌驾群众和使用强迫命令的方法来推动工作，而不愿意或者不懂得依靠群众和使用宣传说服的方法来推动工作。因此，订立和执行爱国公约，将是医治他们这种脱离群众的强迫命令的毛病的良药，这样做，将会帮助他们切实地认识用宣传的方法来推动工作的必要，加强他们的群众观点，使他们懂得无论如何不要脱离群众。
    有些人民政府的和党的地方工作干部，尤其是经济部门的工作干部，在人民解放战争取得基本胜利以后，曾滋长了一种认为天下已经太平的麻痹思想和不问政治的腐朽倾向。若干地方举办的政治测验的结果证明，有些上级机关的普通工作干部对时局和当前政治斗争的认识竟不如区级干部，区干部又不如乡村干部和群众中的积极分子，而以经济工作干部的认识为最差。因此，很明显，首先教育和领导工作干部订立和执行爱国公约，就可帮助党和人民政府去克服有些工作干部的不问政治的错误倾向，从而就可以在根本上提高党和政府的领导工作的效果，推动各项工作的加速发展。
