Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 20th: Over one million workers and employees in Italian government agencies and state-owned enterprises held a massive 24-hour general strike on the 19th to protest the government's refusal to accept their demands for wage increases and subsequent wage adjustments in line with price increases.

This general strike was decided on the 14th by a joint meeting of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Italian Labor Union of the right-wing Social Democratic Party, the Italian Confederation of Labor Unions of Working People of the Christian Democratic Party, and independent civil service unions. This is the third general strike held by Italian civil servants this year, following the two general strikes on May 8th and June 22nd.

At midnight on the 19th, all activities of the national state-owned railways ceased; trains running on various lines stopped after reaching the next major station. The Associated Press acknowledged that "this railway standstill is the most serious since 1920." At the same time, work in telegraph offices, telephone offices, and post offices came to a complete halt. More than 90 percent of the staff in the agencies under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of the Treasury participated in the strike. Seventy percent of the workers and employees in enterprises under the Ministry of National Defense and naval and army factories refused to go to work. Hardly anyone went to work in various government departments.

Despite Acting Prime Minister Pella's vigorous intimidation of the strikers and the mobilization of thousands upon thousands of fully armed police and soldiers to suppress the strike, the general strike proceeded extremely smoothly throughout the country, and the workers demonstrated a high degree of unity. On the morning of the 19th, strikers in Rome, disregarding the suppression of large numbers of military police on the streets, held a grand rally at the Adriano Theatre. Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, and Pastore, Secretary of the Italian Confederation of Labor Unions of Working People, affiliated with the Catholic Church, both delivered speeches at the rally.

The day before the strike, Vittorio held a press conference to explain the purpose of the strike. He pointed out that since January 1950, the cost of living in Italy had risen by 13 percent; therefore, government employees had to fight for corresponding wage increases. All the working people of Italy support this struggle because they know that the government's continuous attacks on the living standards of civil servants, railway employees, teachers, and employees of all state institutions foreshadow a general attack on the already low living standards of workers in all sectors of the Italian economy.

    抗议政府拒绝增加工资的合理要求
    意政府机关百余万工人和雇员总罢工
    全意铁路邮电部门停止活动二十四小时
    【新华社二十日讯】罗马消息：意大利政府机关和国营企业的一百多万工人和雇员，在十九日举行了声势浩大的二十四小时总罢工，抗议政府拒绝接受他们所提增加工资并在今后随时按照物价调整工资的要求。
    这次总罢工，是意大利总工会、右翼社会民主党的意大利劳工联盟、基督教民主党的意大利劳动人民工会联合会和独立的公务员工会这几个组织的联席会议在十四日决定的。这是意大利公务员继五月八日和六月二十二日两次总罢工以后，在今年举行的第三次总罢工。
    十九日零时，全国国营铁路的一切活动都停止；奔驰在各线路上的火车在到达了下一个大车站后就停止下来。合众社承认：“这次铁路的停顿是一九二○年以来最严重的一次。”同时，电报局、电话局和邮政局的工作完全停顿。邮电部、财政部和国库部所属各机构百分之九十以上的工作人员参加了罢工。国防部所属各企业和陆海军工厂百分之七十的工人和雇员都拒绝上工。政府各部门也都没有什么人去上班。
    尽管代理总理皮齐阿尼向罢工者大肆恫吓，并动员了成千成万全副武装的警察和士兵来镇压罢工，但是总罢工在全国各地都进行得极为顺利，工人们表现了高度的团结一致。十九日晨，罗马的罢工者又不顾大批宪警在街头弹压，在阿达里亚诺剧院举行了盛大集会。意大利总工会总书记维多里奥和天主教的意大利劳动人民工会联合会书记巴斯托，都在会上发表了演说。
    在这次罢工前一天，维多里奥曾举行记者招待会，说明这次罢工的目的。他指出：从一九五○年一月以来，意大利的生活费用已上涨了百分之十三；因此，政府雇员不得不为争取工资的相应提高而斗争。意大利的全体劳动人民都支持这个斗争，因为他们知道：政府对公务员、铁道员工、教师和一切国家机构的雇员的生活水平的不断进攻，就是预示着不久就要对意大利各业劳动者本来已经很低的生活水平实行总进攻。
