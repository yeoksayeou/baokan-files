    Fengtai Locomotive Depot Completes Clearing of Working Capital; More Than Two-Thirds of Surplus Materials Transferred to Tianjin Railway Administration for Unified Allocation

    The Tianjin Railway Administration's Fengtai Locomotive Depot has completed its clearing of working capital, revealing a serious phenomenon of stockpiled funds. The materials stockpiled by the depot could supply three locomotive depots of the same size. These stockpiled materials are mostly obsolete and scrap materials, with a total value of approximately 2 billion yuan. When the Fengtai Materials Factory was reorganized in April 1950, the depot moved a large number of materials and scrap materials from the factory to its own depot, without considering the overall interests, only seeking "special convenience when needed," thus creating the phenomenon of stockpiling state funds and freezing materials.

    The concrete manifestation of this lack of an overall perspective is "excessive requisition and misuse." The depot's annual material budget exceeds the actual consumption of materials. The material supply plan does not match reality; many materials needed, such as boiler tubes, are not available, causing work stoppages due to lack of materials. On the other hand, a large number of materials cannot be used, such as the inclined wedges of locomotives, which can last for more than ten years. There is also blind production in the manufacturing of materials; for example, there is a stockpile of 1.3 billion yuan worth of cast copper and cast iron materials for locomotive parts.

    Before the depot cleared its working capital, this waste of materials seriously hindered the establishment of the economic accounting system. In the past, the specifications and dimensions of materials did not match the actual situation; for example, two-inch iron was recorded as one inch in the material ledger. When the factory received it for use, it also recorded it as one inch, so the material consumption quota was inaccurate. Some material prices were incorrect; the cost of manufacturing a dry steam pipe pad was only a few hundred yuan, but the bureau-set material price was 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The inaccuracy of material prices also affected the accuracy of cost calculation.

    After clearing its working capital, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot has basically eliminated the phenomenon of massive material stockpiles. More than two-thirds of the surplus materials have been transferred to the Tianjin Railway Administration for unified allocation. The depot's material budget is also accurate; the past situations of inventory surpluses and deficits, and off-the-books items no longer exist.

    The Fengtai Locomotive Depot's investigation of materials and clearing of working capital went through multiple procedures. At the beginning of 1951, when the depot was studying the economic accounting system, it discovered the serious situation of frozen materials. In the first quarter, it began to request the return of some materials to the materials factory. In April, it mobilized more than 70 people to form an investigation team; however, it only conducted a three-day, quick inspection, and the work was not thorough enough. Recently, the depot established a working capital verification committee to carry out a comprehensive inventory, and discovered another 172 obsolete items and various off-the-books items.

    The Fengtai Locomotive Depot's experience in clearing working capital proves that the phenomenon of stockpiling funds in some railway units is serious. To change this unreasonable situation, detailed work must be carried out. It would be obviously wrong to think that "past investigations have been conducted" and to not attach importance to this clearing of working capital. (People's Railway News)

### 丰台机务段流动资金清理完毕  多余三分之二的材料划归天津铁路管理局统一调配

    丰台机务段流动资金清理完毕
    多余三分之二的材料划归天津铁路管理局统一调配
    天津铁路管理局丰台机务段流动资金清理完毕，发现积压资金的现象相当严重。该段积压的材料，可以供给同等规模的三个机务段使用。这些积存的材料，大部是呆料和旧废料，总值约二十余亿元。一九五○年四月丰台材料厂改组时，该段将该厂大批材料和旧废料搬到自己段内，不考虑整体利益，只求“用的时候特别方便”，因此造成积压国家资金和冻结材料等现象。
    这种缺乏整体观念的思想的具体表现，就是“多要滥用”。该段每年材料预算，都超过实际用料的消耗量。材料供应计划不符实际，许多要用的材料如烟管等则没有，造成停工待料现象。另一方面，大批材料又使用不上，如机车的直斜铁可以用十年以上。在材料的制造上也存在着盲目生产的现象，如机车配件铸铜铸铁料一项就积压了十三亿元。
    在该段未清理流动资金以前，这种材料浪费的现象严重地妨碍了经济核算制的建立。过去材料规格、尺寸与实际情况不符，本来是二寸的铁，材料账上却写一寸，工厂领去使用，也照一寸出账，所以材料消费定额就不准确。有些材料价目不对，自己制造的干汽管子垫的成本仅几百元，而局定的料价却要四、五千元。由于料价的不正确，也影响成本计算的准确性。
    丰台机务段清理流动资金以后，基本上消灭了大量材料的积压现象。多余的三分之二以上的材料，已划归天津铁路管理局统一配用。该段材料预算也准确了，过去点盈点亏、账外品等情况已不存在。
    丰台机务段清查材料和清理流动资金是经过多次手续的。一九五一年初，该段学习经济核算制时就发现了冻结材料的严重情况，第一季度并开始要求将一部分材料退还材料厂。四月间又发动七十余人组成清查小组；但仅以三天时间，突击检查，工作不够细致。最近该段成立核定资金委员会，开展全面清点工作，又发现呆料一百七十二项和账外品多种。
    丰台机务段清理流动资金的经验证明：铁路上某些单位积压资金的现象是严重的。要改变这种不合理的情况，必须进行细致的工作。如果认为“过去清查过”而不重视此次清理流动资产的工作，那显然就是错误的。（人民铁道报）
