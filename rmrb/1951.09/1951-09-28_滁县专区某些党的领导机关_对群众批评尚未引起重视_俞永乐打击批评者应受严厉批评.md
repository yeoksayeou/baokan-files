    Certain Party Leadership Organs in Chuxian Prefecture
    Have Not Paid Attention to Mass Criticism
    Yu Yongle Should Be Severely Criticized for Suppressing Criticism

To the Editor:

    Since the CCP Central Committee issued the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals," it has aroused much attention to criticism and self-criticism among cadres and the masses in Chuxian Prefecture, Wanbei. However, some party leadership organs have not fully supported the criticism of the people, nor have they promptly educated those who have been criticized, urging them to reply publicly. Some cadres or departments that have been criticized also lack a correct understanding of the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, believing that public self-criticism in newspapers will make them lose "face" and "prestige"; believing that after being criticized, "it is enough to correct it quietly"; some even excuse themselves, unwilling or refusing to make public self-criticism. In the four months since April of this year, the Chuxian Prefecture newspaper "Chuxian Newsletter" has continuously published 54 reader criticisms, but apart from a few criticized individuals who have made public self-criticism or replies, 42 have not received replies. Particularly serious is Yu Yongle, instructor of the Nengren Township in Luqiao District, Dingyuan County, who has refused to accept criticism three times in a row and suppressed the critic. The May 7th issue, No. 168 of the "Chuxian Newsletter" published Zhao Yu Shi's (i.e., Zhao Changfu) criticism of the Nengren Township government in Dingyuan Luqiao District for failing to distribute 700 jin of relief grain (at that time, the district suffered a severe disaster), and pointed out that "relief grain is urgently needed by disaster victims to survive, and no one should withhold it without reason. It is hoped that the district will promptly check it." However, after being criticized, the township instructor Yu Yongle not only did not correct the mistake but instead suppressed the critic. The May 25th issue, No. 174 of the "Chuxian Newsletter" published another letter from Zhao Changfu, in which he said: "Your newspaper published my criticism in the May 7th issue,… After Yu Yongle saw it, he not only did not correct it, but also scolded and threatened me. I was ready to write to you on the 9th, but I was afraid that if you published this letter in the newspaper, wouldn't I be scolded even more severely? So I didn't write to you until now. He is still scolding me: 'You are not a party member, what qualifications do you have to write to the party newspaper? You need to make a deep self-examination!' At the same time, he also wants to put me in a detention room.…" However, Yu Yongle still refused to accept criticism. The July 6th issue, No. 188 of the "Chuxian Newsletter" published a criticism from reader Zhi Nong: "After Zhao Changfu's letter about the Nengren Township instructor suppressing the critic was published in your journal, Yu Yongle not only did not accept it, but instead flew into a rage and said: 'Who wrote it, who is responsible!' He said a lot of angry words. I think Zhao Changfu's criticism is basically correct. It is a fact that Nengren Township withheld the relief grain and did not distribute it downwards.… It is hoped that the Luqiao District Committee will help him recognize his mistake so as to avoid greater losses in future work, and it is hoped that Comrade Yu Yongle will reply publicly in the 'Chuxian Newsletter.…" However, for this kind of bad tendency of refusing to accept criticism and repeatedly suppressing the critic, the CCP Dingyuan County Luqiao District Committee had not publicly expressed its attitude or seriously dealt with it as of August 26. Judging from these many cases of refusing to make public self-criticism or reply to criticism in the newspaper, it shows that the party leadership organs in Chuxian Prefecture have not paid enough attention to the CCP Central Committee's decision. Now, I am telling you about the above situation, hoping that you can help solve it.

        Reader Luo Ming

Editor's Note: Judging from the situation reflected by the reader Luo Ming, the understanding of certain party leadership organs in Chuxian Prefecture regarding public criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals is quite vague. This has objectively fueled the bad tendency of resisting criticism; damaged the prestige of the party and government among the people. This cannot be tolerated. Yu Yongle's behavior of suppressing the critic is completely wrong. The local relevant departments should conduct a thorough investigation and handle it promptly.

    滁县专区某些党的领导机关
    对群众批评尚未引起重视
    俞永乐打击批评者应受严厉批评编辑同志：
    自中共中央发布“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”后，在皖北滁县专区已引起很多干部与群众对批评与自我批评的重视。但是某些党的领导机关，还没有全力支持人民群众的批评，也没有及时地对被批评者进行教育，督促被批评者公开答复。而一些被批评的干部或部门，对于批评与自我批评的精神也还缺乏正确的认识，认为在报纸上进行公开的自我批评会失掉他们的“面子”和“威信”；认为受到批评后“只要悄悄改正就是了”；甚至有人原谅自己，不愿或拒绝公开检讨。从今年四月份以来的四个月中，滁县专区的报纸“滁县通讯”连续发表了五十四篇读者批评来稿，除少数被批评者已公开检讨或答复外，尚有四十二件没有得到答复。其中特别严重的是定远县炉桥区能仁乡指导员俞永乐，连续三次拒绝批评，并打击批评者。五月七日一六八期“滁县通讯”上刊登有赵遇时（即赵昌富）批评定远炉桥区能仁乡乡政府有七百斤救济粮未发下去（当时该区灾情严重）的错误，提出“救济粮是灾民迫切需要度命的东西，任何人不得无故扣下不发。希望该区迅速检查一下”。但该乡指导员俞永乐受到批评后，不但不纠正，反而打击批评的人。五月二十五日一七四期的“滁县通讯”上又刊出赵昌富的来信，信中说：“贵报在五月七日刊登了我………的批评稿件，………俞永乐看见后，不但不纠正，还对我痛骂和威胁。我在九号就准备写信告诉你们，但又怕你们在报上发表这封信，那我不是更要受他的痛骂吗？所以我直到现在才写信给你们。他现在还骂我：‘你不是党员，有什么资格给党报写稿呢？你要深刻检查！’同时，他还要关我的禁闭室。……”但是，俞永乐还是拒绝批评。七月六日的一八八期“滁县通讯”上又刊出读者智侬写的批评稿件：“赵昌富同志写的能仁乡指导员打击批评的人一信，在贵刊发表后，俞永乐不但不接受，反而大发脾气说：‘那个写的，那个要负责任！’说了很多气话。我认为赵昌富同志的批评基本上是正确的，能仁乡扣住救济粮未往下发是事实。…………希望炉桥区委帮助他认识错误，以免今后工作中遭受更大损失，并希望俞永乐同志在‘滁县通讯’上公开答复。……”但是，对于这种拒绝批评，一再打击批评者的恶劣倾向，中共定远县炉桥区委员会直至八月二十六日尚未公开表示态度，严肃处理。从这许多拒绝在报上公开检讨或答复批评的情形看来，说明了滁县专区党的领导机关对中共中央的决定还未引起足够的重视。现在，我将上述情况告诉你们，希望你们能够帮助解决。        读者  罗明
    编者按：从读者罗明反映的情况来看，滁县专区某些党的领导机关对于在报纸刊物上进行公开批评与自我批评的认识是相当模糊的。这在客观上已经助长了抗拒批评的恶劣倾向；损害了党与政府在人民群众中的威信。这是不能被容许的。俞永乐打击批评者的行为，是完全错误的。当地有关部门应切实调查，迅速处理。
