The Experience of Participating in the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival
Chinese Youth Delegation

The Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival was held in Berlin from August 5th to 19th. This was a great victory for the world's youth in defending peace and opposing the danger of a new war. The festival was attended by 25,000 youth representatives from 104 countries around the world, as well as 2 million young people from all over Germany. The festival fully demonstrated the strong desire of young people around the world to strengthen friendship and unity for peace, and gave a powerful rebuff to the sinister conspiracies of the warmongers who attempt to drag young people into a world war.

The Chinese Youth Delegation participated in this festival to inform young friends around the world of the Chinese youth's contribution to world peace and the Chinese youth's strong determination to unite with young people around the world and contribute all their strength to defend peace. The Chinese Youth Delegation also held many carnivals with young people from all over the world in Berlin, exchanged experiences in the struggle to defend peace, and greatly strengthened the friendship and unity between Chinese youth and world youth.

All members of the Chinese Youth Delegation, except for the performing arts troupe that was invited to stay temporarily in the German Democratic Republic and will go to the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries to perform, have returned to China. Now, we will give a brief report to the young friends of China on our participation in the festival.

Chinese Youth Made Full Preparations

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chinese youth are forever loyal to the cause of peace. Therefore, we attach great importance to participating in the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival. Chinese youth selected a youth delegation of 332 people, including combat heroes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, labor models of industry, transportation, and Huai River governance, representatives of Chinese ethnic minorities and religious youth, youth work cadres, basketball and volleyball teams, and a performing arts troupe including opera troupes, singing troupes, orchestras, dance troupes, and acrobatic troupes. In addition, there were members of the Chinese children's team participating in the "Young Pioneers Republic" camp in Berlin.

The process of preparing for the festival was a period of active development of the Chinese movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. During this period, all Chinese youth contributed all their strength to the cause of peace in the battles on the front lines and in the patriotic production movement in the rear. Members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the broad masses of young people played an active role in the signature and voting campaigns calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact and opposing the arming of Japan. This work was the best gift from Chinese youth to the Peace Festival. The selection of literary and artistic programs and the competition for basketball and volleyball players began in March this year. On "May Fourth" this year, a joint performance of literary and artistic programs and a national basketball and volleyball competition were held in Beijing. In order to let young friends around the world understand the growth of New China and the efforts of Chinese youth for peace, we also prepared an exhibition of 400 large photos. In addition, all Chinese youth prepared many politically significant gifts for young peace fighters from various countries, including cloisonn√© plates painted with peace doves, brocades woven with portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Pieck, and Chairman Mao, peace dove badges and carvings. A particularly noteworthy gift was the vase made from captured American artillery shell casings by the youth of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Chinese youth have made full preparations for participating in the festival.

The Festival is a Great Victory for Defending Peace
and a Serious Battle

The convening of the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival, as World Federation of Democratic Youth President Billinguer said in his report to the WFDM Council, is a powerful demonstration of the friendly unity of young people from all countries around the world in the struggle to defend peace and oppose the instigators of a new world war; the festival is a gathering and assembly of youth representatives from all countries, all nations, all with different political views, different religious beliefs, and thousands of youth organizations. All young men and women are united in the desire to fight for their common cause: peace!

A peaceful gathering of peace-loving youth is not a simple or easy task. The US and British imperialists and warmongers, who are actively expanding their armaments, arming West Germany and Japan, and frantically preparing for war, harbor extreme fear and hatred for the ever-surging world people's peace movement. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the difficulties that young people from many capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries will encounter in sending their representatives to participate in such a great peace demonstration. Some countries in France, Italy, and South America used police to attack and prevent young people from participating in the festival; the governments of the United States, France, Italy, India, Burma, Syria, Iran, Israel, and Japan did not issue passports to young people attending the festival. In Iran, a dozen young people were killed and injured by reactionaries. Two thousand young representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and Switzerland encountered unreasonable obstruction from the US occupation authorities while passing through Austria on their way to Berlin. US troops barbarously beat them with rifle butts and even stabbed them with bayonets, giving them no food or water. Two girls were surrounded on the railway and were run over by a train, and twelve representatives were injured. The border of West Germany was full of sentry posts. In the Hof district of West Germany, armored vehicles opened fire and killed three German youths. A young man named Werner Dieg, from a social democratic organization, was also driven into the Elbe River and drowned on the border. On the Bavarian border, West German police attacked 300 young people going to Berlin. One person was killed, many young people were injured, and hundreds of young people were arrested. In addition, the US imperialists also allocated 600,000 US dollars from the "Marshall Plan" to the so-called "West Berlin Independent Trade Union Organization" specifically for the purpose of sabotaging the festival. They sent a special agent organization called "Free Parliament" to Berlin to do sabotage work, and they spread a large number of rumors, such as saying "1.2 million young people have gone to West Berlin" and "there is no food to eat in East Berlin." They sent special agents to try to poison the representatives' food.

These facts not only show how savage and shameless the enemies of peace are, but also show how brave and resourceful the young representatives of these countries must be and how many serious difficulties they must overcome to reach Berlin. Therefore, the peace-loving youth of these countries must undergo the most serious struggles to participate in the festival.

All the sabotage conspiracies of the reactionaries were finally completely bankrupt in the face of the youth's determination to defend peace. Their shameless atrocities aroused the unparalleled anger and protest of the broad masses of young people and the people, and sparked a movement to assist the persecuted. Many young people were obstructed many times, but still tried their best to come to Berlin. Some disguised themselves and crossed the border separately, and some swam across the river. Representatives from all European and Asian countries, 38 colonial countries and 17 Latin American countries participated in the festival. Three thousand representatives came from France, one thousand from Britain, and sixty from the United States, and the Italian youth, in response to the reactionary government's ban, increased the original one thousand representatives to one thousand and three hundred. Under the barbaric oppression of the Adenauer reactionary government, more than 35,000 young people from West Germany broke through numerous blockades and fought all the way to Berlin.

Among the young people who came to Berlin were young workers, young farmers, students, young staff, and young artists. Their political inclinations included: Communists, Socialists, Liberals, Republicans, Radicals, Monarchists, Conservatives, etc. Their religious beliefs included: various denominations of Catholicism and Christianity, Buddhists, Muslims, and Orthodox believers. They represented sports, culture, student, artist clubs, travelers, and humanitarian organizations, and so on. So many young people with different political and religious beliefs came to Berlin to participate in the festival, which proves that the World Federation of Democratic Youth's policy is correct: in order to oppose the danger of a new war and defend world peace, it is necessary to unite widely all young people with good intentions and who oppose war, regardless of their political inclination, religious belief, or social component. Facts have proved that the desire for peace is so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people that it has emitted an irresistible and huge force of unity and combat.

This festival had 22 more countries and 15,000 more representatives than the Second Festival held in Budapest two years ago. These newly added countries established contact with the World Federation of Democratic Youth for the first time. This powerfully illustrates that the world's peace forces have greatly increased and are still increasing day by day.

The Great Progress and Efforts of German Youth

The victory of the festival is not only manifested in the participation of so many young representatives from various countries around the world, but also in the fact that it can be successfully convened in Berlin. Because the US imperialists are stepping up their arming of West Germany in order to create a world war, Berlin has become the forefront of the struggle between peace forces and US imperialism in Europe.

Liberated by the Soviet army and with the help of the Soviet Union's great internationalist spirit, under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party and President Pieck, the youth of the German Democratic Republic have made extremely significant progress. They have turned from the poison of fascist national hatred to love for peace and love for the people of all countries. The great progress and efforts of the German youth and the German people are one of the main factors for the smooth convening of the festival in Berlin.

In order to prepare for the festival, the Free German Youth completed huge organizational work. They mobilized young workers in state-owned industries to complete their tasks an average of 19 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by a total of 6,200,9195 workdays. German youth held 100,000 peace conferences and mass rallies in one and a half months, with more than 3,715,000 people participating. They launched 4,145,839 young people to jointly sign letters to Stalin, guaranteeing that German youth will defend peace to the end. During the movement, 390,583 young men and women and teenagers joined the Free German Youth League and the Young Pioneers, and 1,056,998 young people studied "On the Foundations of Leninism." In order to prepare for the convening of the festival in Berlin, German youth newly built many sports fields, such as the Stalin Avenue Gymnasium (accommodating more than 6,000 people), which they completed in 141 days, a project that would normally take two years. They also completed many swimming pools, gymnasiums, and rubble-clearing work. German youth often mobilized 2,000 young workers from various places to form construction teams to participate in construction projects in Berlin. German youth decorated the streets and venues of Berlin very beautifully, and everywhere was filled with a festive atmosphere. They prepared dormitories for 25,000 foreign youth guests and arranged accommodation for 1.5 million young people from various places. During the festival, they had to prepare 350,000 liters of food every day - and 750,000 liters of food every day from August 10th to 13th. In order to transport young people from various places to Berlin, 592 special trains were opened and 6,000 trucks were mobilized. Ten thousand women in Berlin participated in cutting potatoes every day. These huge organizational tasks formed a heated political mobilization for the German youth and the German people to fight for peace. Young representatives from various countries thanked the German youth for their very warm and thoughtful hospitality. All peace-loving youth around the world will feel even more that the truth of peace is an invincible force because of the great progress of the German youth.

We Expressed the Determination of Chinese Youth to Always be Loyal to the Cause of Peace

Here, we will talk about the situation after the opening of the festival.

The eastern part of Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, became a carnival city during the two weeks of the festival. The streets were crowded with young representatives from various countries with different skin colors and clothing. The flags of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Student Union, and various countries were flying everywhere; peace slogans in various languages were hung everywhere, and portraits of Stalin and leaders of the people of various countries were posted everywhere; enthusiastic songs and cheers of friendship filled the air; art performances and sports competitions were held simultaneously in many places.

In addition to the opening and closing ceremonies of the festival, which were two extremely grand mass gatherings, on August 12th, two million German youth held a great march and demonstration against the arming of West Germany and demanding the conclusion of a treaty this year. During the festival, many peace gatherings were also held, mainly: the "Demonstration of Support for Young Women Peace Fighters" by 50,000 young women (9th), the "Youth Conference for Outstanding Achievements in Collecting Peace Signatures" (10th), "Colonial Youth Day" (16th), "World Student Day" (also the 5th anniversary of the founding of the International Student Union, 17th). In addition, the 11th World Student Summer Games, with 2,000 athletes from 42 countries participating, was also held in Berlin at the same time. All these gatherings brought together the voices of peace-loving youth from all over the world into one huge voice: Peace! Friendship! Oppose the danger of a new war! Immediately conclude a five-power peace pact!

The Chinese Youth Delegation participated in all these peace gatherings and faithfully expressed the determination of Chinese youth to always be loyal to the cause of peace.

At the opening ceremony held at the Ulbricht Stadium on August 5th, the stands and aisles that could accommodate 80,000 spectators were crowded with people. Delegations from various countries entered the venue in alphabetical order of the country's name. The Soviet, Chinese, and Korean delegations were greeted with the warmest cheers from the crowd. The cheers of "Long live Stalin!" and "Long live Mao Zedong!" continued endlessly. After speeches by World Federation of Democratic Youth President Billinguer, International Student Union President Groman, German Democratic Republic President Pieck, and Soviet Youth Delegation Leader Mikhailov, Chinese Youth Delegation Leader Feng Wenbin addressed the conference, bringing the respect and congratulations of Chinese youth to peace fighters from all over the world. He especially reported on the most important contribution made by Chinese youth to defending world peace - the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and emphasized the personal experience of Chinese youth: "Peace cannot be begged for, peace must be won." In his report, he told young people around the world that imperialist colonialists in the East were increasingly approaching complete bankruptcy. He represented the Chinese youth in guaranteeing to the world youth that the Chinese youth would contribute all their strength to the cause of peace.

At the closing ceremony on August 19th, the youth of the five major powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, China, Britain, and France, walked at the forefront of the parade. At this meeting, Comrade Feng Wenbin once again delivered a speech on behalf of the Chinese youth. He pointed out the great victory of the festival and pointed out that the festival greatly improved the determination and confidence of the Chinese youth and young friends around the world to fight side by side to defend world peace. At the same time, he firmly stated that Chinese youth and the Chinese people would never tolerate the US imperialists concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan and reviving Japanese imperialism. Chinese youth resolutely demanded the immediate conclusion of a five-power peace pact and would always be loyal to the cause of peace.

The oath at the closing ceremony even more concentratedly expressed the will of peace fighters from all over the world. The oath was short and very powerful. In the name of two million young people from 104 countries, it swore to do everything possible to prevent the outbreak of a new war, strengthen the friendship and peaceful cooperation between the people and youth of all countries, consolidate and expand the unity of youth, and strive for the movement to conclude a five-power peace pact.

"We swear! We swear! We swear!" The ending of this oath, repeated three times, was a solemn announcement to the world in dozens of different languages on Marx-Engels Square in Berlin. Its voice will resound throughout the world. It will enable young peace fighters around the world to gain greater strength from it, and will make the warmongers tremble in front of it!

The great march of two million German youth held on August 12th powerfully demonstrated the determination of the German youth and the German people to oppose the arming of West Germany and strive for the conclusion of a treaty within the year. The marching crowd constantly cheered the young representatives of various countries, while holding high slogans such as "No soldiers for Adenauer," "Not a penny for re-militarization," and "American soldiers get out." They also held up slogans thanking the Soviet Union and learning from Soviet youth. The procession of 35,000 young people from West Germany received the warmest welcome. They held up the slogan "Germany must be unified." Among them were young peace fighters who had bravely landed on Helgoland Island, which was used as a bombing practice target by the British Air Force, and raised the German flag high, and young peasant representatives from the Main River Basin, who protested against turning their fields into American shooting ranges. This great review of German youth peace forces, which lasted eight hours, once again demonstrated the firm will of the German youth to strive for a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, and to strive for peace and international friendship and unity.
