The Experience of Participating in the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival
Chinese Youth Delegation

The Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival was held in Berlin from August 5th to 19th. This was a great victory for the world's youth in defending peace and opposing the danger of a new war. The festival was attended by 25,000 youth representatives from 104 countries around the world, as well as 2 million young people from all over Germany. The festival fully demonstrated the strong desire of young people around the world to strengthen friendship and unity for peace, and gave a powerful rebuff to the sinister conspiracies of the warmongers who attempt to drag young people into a world war.

The Chinese Youth Delegation participated in this festival to inform young friends around the world of the Chinese youth's contribution to world peace and the Chinese youth's strong determination to unite with young people around the world and contribute all their strength to defend peace. The Chinese Youth Delegation also held many carnivals with young people from all over the world in Berlin, exchanged experiences in the struggle to defend peace, and greatly strengthened the friendship and unity between Chinese youth and world youth.

All members of the Chinese Youth Delegation, except for the performing arts troupe that was invited to stay temporarily in the German Democratic Republic and will go to the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries to perform, have returned to China. Now, we will give a brief report to the young friends of China on our participation in the festival.

Chinese Youth Made Full Preparations

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chinese youth are forever loyal to the cause of peace. Therefore, we attach great importance to participating in the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival. Chinese youth selected a youth delegation of 332 people, including combat heroes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, labor models of industry, transportation, and Huai River governance, representatives of Chinese ethnic minorities and religious youth, youth work cadres, basketball and volleyball teams, and a performing arts troupe including opera troupes, singing troupes, orchestras, dance troupes, and acrobatic troupes. In addition, there were members of the Chinese children's team participating in the "Young Pioneers Republic" camp in Berlin.

The process of preparing for the festival was a period of active development of the Chinese movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. During this period, all Chinese youth contributed all their strength to the cause of peace in the battles on the front lines and in the patriotic production movement in the rear. Members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the broad masses of young people played an active role in the signature and voting campaigns calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact and opposing the arming of Japan. This work was the best gift from Chinese youth to the Peace Festival. The selection of literary and artistic programs and the competition for basketball and volleyball players began in March this year. On "May Fourth" this year, a joint performance of literary and artistic programs and a national basketball and volleyball competition were held in Beijing. In order to let young friends around the world understand the growth of New China and the efforts of Chinese youth for peace, we also prepared an exhibition of 400 large photos. In addition, all Chinese youth prepared many politically significant gifts for young peace fighters from various countries, including cloisonné plates painted with peace doves, brocades woven with portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Pieck, and Chairman Mao, peace dove badges and carvings. A particularly noteworthy gift was the vase made from captured American artillery shell casings by the youth of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Chinese youth have made full preparations for participating in the festival.

The Festival is a Great Victory for Defending Peace
and a Serious Battle

The convening of the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival, as World Federation of Democratic Youth President Billinguer said in his report to the WFDM Council, is a powerful demonstration of the friendly unity of young people from all countries around the world in the struggle to defend peace and oppose the instigators of a new world war; the festival is a gathering and assembly of youth representatives from all countries, all nations, all with different political views, different religious beliefs, and thousands of youth organizations. All young men and women are united in the desire to fight for their common cause: peace!

A peaceful gathering of peace-loving youth is not a simple or easy task. The US and British imperialists and warmongers, who are actively expanding their armaments, arming West Germany and Japan, and frantically preparing for war, harbor extreme fear and hatred for the ever-surging world people's peace movement. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the difficulties that young people from many capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries will encounter in sending their representatives to participate in such a great peace demonstration. Some countries in France, Italy, and South America used police to attack and prevent young people from participating in the festival; the governments of the United States, France, Italy, India, Burma, Syria, Iran, Israel, and Japan did not issue passports to young people attending the festival. In Iran, a dozen young people were killed and injured by reactionaries. Two thousand young representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and Switzerland encountered unreasonable obstruction from the US occupation authorities while passing through Austria on their way to Berlin. US troops barbarously beat them with rifle butts and even stabbed them with bayonets, giving them no food or water. Two girls were surrounded on the railway and were run over by a train, and twelve representatives were injured. The border of West Germany was full of sentry posts. In the Hof district of West Germany, armored vehicles opened fire and killed three German youths. A young man named Werner Dieg, from a social democratic organization, was also driven into the Elbe River and drowned on the border. On the Bavarian border, West German police attacked 300 young people going to Berlin. One person was killed, many young people were injured, and hundreds of young people were arrested. In addition, the US imperialists also allocated 600,000 US dollars from the "Marshall Plan" to the so-called "West Berlin Independent Trade Union Organization" specifically for the purpose of sabotaging the festival. They sent a special agent organization called "Free Parliament" to Berlin to do sabotage work, and they spread a large number of rumors, such as saying "1.2 million young people have gone to West Berlin" and "there is no food to eat in East Berlin." They sent special agents to try to poison the representatives' food.

These facts not only show how savage and shameless the enemies of peace are, but also show how brave and resourceful the young representatives of these countries must be and how many serious difficulties they must overcome to reach Berlin. Therefore, the peace-loving youth of these countries must undergo the most serious struggles to participate in the festival.

All the sabotage conspiracies of the reactionaries were finally completely bankrupt in the face of the youth's determination to defend peace. Their shameless atrocities aroused the unparalleled anger and protest of the broad masses of young people and the people, and sparked a movement to assist the persecuted. Many young people were obstructed many times, but still tried their best to come to Berlin. Some disguised themselves and crossed the border separately, and some swam across the river. Representatives from all European and Asian countries, 38 colonial countries and 17 Latin American countries participated in the festival. Three thousand representatives came from France, one thousand from Britain, and sixty from the United States, and the Italian youth, in response to the reactionary government's ban, increased the original one thousand representatives to one thousand and three hundred. Under the barbaric oppression of the Adenauer reactionary government, more than 35,000 young people from West Germany broke through numerous blockades and fought all the way to Berlin.

Among the young people who came to Berlin were young workers, young farmers, students, young staff, and young artists. Their political inclinations included: Communists, Socialists, Liberals, Republicans, Radicals, Monarchists, Conservatives, etc. Their religious beliefs included: various denominations of Catholicism and Christianity, Buddhists, Muslims, and Orthodox believers. They represented sports, culture, student, artist clubs, travelers, and humanitarian organizations, and so on. So many young people with different political and religious beliefs came to Berlin to participate in the festival, which proves that the World Federation of Democratic Youth's policy is correct: in order to oppose the danger of a new war and defend world peace, it is necessary to unite widely all young people with good intentions and who oppose war, regardless of their political inclination, religious belief, or social component. Facts have proved that the desire for peace is so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people that it has emitted an irresistible and huge force of unity and combat.

This festival had 22 more countries and 15,000 more representatives than the Second Festival held in Budapest two years ago. These newly added countries established contact with the World Federation of Democratic Youth for the first time. This powerfully illustrates that the world's peace forces have greatly increased and are still increasing day by day.

The Great Progress and Efforts of German Youth

The victory of the festival is not only manifested in the participation of so many young representatives from various countries around the world, but also in the fact that it can be successfully convened in Berlin. Because the US imperialists are stepping up their arming of West Germany in order to create a world war, Berlin has become the forefront of the struggle between peace forces and US imperialism in Europe.

Liberated by the Soviet army and with the help of the Soviet Union's great internationalist spirit, under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party and President Pieck, the youth of the German Democratic Republic have made extremely significant progress. They have turned from the poison of fascist national hatred to love for peace and love for the people of all countries. The great progress and efforts of the German youth and the German people are one of the main factors for the smooth convening of the festival in Berlin.

In order to prepare for the festival, the Free German Youth completed huge organizational work. They mobilized young workers in state-owned industries to complete their tasks an average of 19 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by a total of 6,200,9195 workdays. German youth held 100,000 peace conferences and mass rallies in one and a half months, with more than 3,715,000 people participating. They launched 4,145,839 young people to jointly sign letters to Stalin, guaranteeing that German youth will defend peace to the end. During the movement, 390,583 young men and women and teenagers joined the Free German Youth League and the Young Pioneers, and 1,056,998 young people studied "On the Foundations of Leninism." In order to prepare for the convening of the festival in Berlin, German youth newly built many sports fields, such as the Stalin Avenue Gymnasium (accommodating more than 6,000 people), which they completed in 141 days, a project that would normally take two years. They also completed many swimming pools, gymnasiums, and rubble-clearing work. German youth often mobilized 2,000 young workers from various places to form construction teams to participate in construction projects in Berlin. German youth decorated the streets and venues of Berlin very beautifully, and everywhere was filled with a festive atmosphere. They prepared dormitories for 25,000 foreign youth guests and arranged accommodation for 1.5 million young people from various places. During the festival, they had to prepare 350,000 liters of food every day - and 750,000 liters of food every day from August 10th to 13th. In order to transport young people from various places to Berlin, 592 special trains were opened and 6,000 trucks were mobilized. Ten thousand women in Berlin participated in cutting potatoes every day. These huge organizational tasks formed a heated political mobilization for the German youth and the German people to fight for peace. Young representatives from various countries thanked the German youth for their very warm and thoughtful hospitality. All peace-loving youth around the world will feel even more that the truth of peace is an invincible force because of the great progress of the German youth.

We Expressed the Determination of Chinese Youth to Always be Loyal to the Cause of Peace

Here, we will talk about the situation after the opening of the festival.

The eastern part of Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, became a carnival city during the two weeks of the festival. The streets were crowded with young representatives from various countries with different skin colors and clothing. The flags of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Student Union, and various countries were flying everywhere; peace slogans in various languages were hung everywhere, and portraits of Stalin and leaders of the people of various countries were posted everywhere; enthusiastic songs and cheers of friendship filled the air; art performances and sports competitions were held simultaneously in many places.

In addition to the opening and closing ceremonies of the festival, which were two extremely grand mass gatherings, on August 12th, two million German youth held a great march and demonstration against the arming of West Germany and demanding the conclusion of a treaty this year. During the festival, many peace gatherings were also held, mainly: the "Demonstration of Support for Young Women Peace Fighters" by 50,000 young women (9th), the "Youth Conference for Outstanding Achievements in Collecting Peace Signatures" (10th), "Colonial Youth Day" (16th), "World Student Day" (also the 5th anniversary of the founding of the International Student Union, 17th). In addition, the 11th World Student Summer Games, with 2,000 athletes from 42 countries participating, was also held in Berlin at the same time. All these gatherings brought together the voices of peace-loving youth from all over the world into one huge voice: Peace! Friendship! Oppose the danger of a new war! Immediately conclude a five-power peace pact!

The Chinese Youth Delegation participated in all these peace gatherings and faithfully expressed the determination of Chinese youth to always be loyal to the cause of peace.

At the opening ceremony held at the Ulbricht Stadium on August 5th, the stands and aisles that could accommodate 80,000 spectators were crowded with people. Delegations from various countries entered the venue in alphabetical order of the country's name. The Soviet, Chinese, and Korean delegations were greeted with the warmest cheers from the crowd. The cheers of "Long live Stalin!" and "Long live Mao Zedong!" continued endlessly. After speeches by World Federation of Democratic Youth President Billinguer, International Student Union President Groman, German Democratic Republic President Pieck, and Soviet Youth Delegation Leader Mikhailov, Chinese Youth Delegation Leader Feng Wenbin addressed the conference, bringing the respect and congratulations of Chinese youth to peace fighters from all over the world. He especially reported on the most important contribution made by Chinese youth to defending world peace - the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and emphasized the personal experience of Chinese youth: "Peace cannot be begged for, peace must be won." In his report, he told young people around the world that imperialist colonialists in the East were increasingly approaching complete bankruptcy. He represented the Chinese youth in guaranteeing to the world youth that the Chinese youth would contribute all their strength to the cause of peace.

At the closing ceremony on August 19th, the youth of the five major powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, China, Britain, and France, walked at the forefront of the parade. At this meeting, Comrade Feng Wenbin once again delivered a speech on behalf of the Chinese youth. He pointed out the great victory of the festival and pointed out that the festival greatly improved the determination and confidence of the Chinese youth and young friends around the world to fight side by side to defend world peace. At the same time, he firmly stated that Chinese youth and the Chinese people would never tolerate the US imperialists concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan and reviving Japanese imperialism. Chinese youth resolutely demanded the immediate conclusion of a five-power peace pact and would always be loyal to the cause of peace.

The oath at the closing ceremony even more concentratedly expressed the will of peace fighters from all over the world. The oath was short and very powerful. In the name of two million young people from 104 countries, it swore to do everything possible to prevent the outbreak of a new war, strengthen the friendship and peaceful cooperation between the people and youth of all countries, consolidate and expand the unity of youth, and strive for the movement to conclude a five-power peace pact.

"We swear! We swear! We swear!" The ending of this oath, repeated three times, was a solemn announcement to the world in dozens of different languages on Marx-Engels Square in Berlin. Its voice will resound throughout the world. It will enable young peace fighters around the world to gain greater strength from it, and will make the warmongers tremble in front of it!

The great march of two million German youth held on August 12th powerfully demonstrated the determination of the German youth and the German people to oppose the arming of West Germany and strive for the conclusion of a treaty within the year. The marching crowd constantly cheered the young representatives of various countries, while holding high slogans such as "No soldiers for Adenauer," "Not a penny for re-militarization," and "American soldiers get out." They also held up slogans thanking the Soviet Union and learning from Soviet youth. The procession of 35,000 young people from West Germany received the warmest welcome. They held up the slogan "Germany must be unified." Among them were young peace fighters who had bravely landed on Helgoland Island, which was used as a bombing practice target by the British Air Force, and raised the German flag high, and young peasant representatives from the Main River Basin, who protested against turning their fields into American shooting ranges. This great review of German youth peace forces, which lasted eight hours, once again demonstrated the firm will of the German youth to strive for a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, and to strive for peace and international friendship and unity.

    参加第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的经过
    中国青年代表团
    第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节已于八月五日至十九日在柏林举行。这是当前全世界青年为保卫和平、反对新的战争危险的一次伟大的胜利。这次联欢节有全世界一百零四个国家的二万五千青年代表，以及来自德国各地的二百万青年参加。联欢节充分表现了全世界青年为和平而加强友谊团结的强烈愿望，并且给予企图把青年拖入世界大战的战争贩子的罪恶阴谋以极有力的回击。
    中国青年代表团参加本届联欢节，把中国青年对世界和平所作的贡献，以及中国青年愿意和全世界青年团结一致、为保卫和平贡献出自己一切力量的坚强决心，告诉了全世界青年朋友。中国青年代表团并在柏林和全世界各国青年举行了多次的联欢，互相交流了保卫和平的斗争经验，大大加强了中国青年与世界青年的友谊团结。
    中国青年代表团全体团员除文工团应邀暂时留在德意志民主共和国并将赴苏联和东欧人民民主国家表演外，已经先后返国。现在把我们参加联欢节的经过，向全中国青年朋友作一简略的报告。
    中国青年做了充分的准备工作
    中国青年在毛泽东主席的教导下，是永远忠实于和平事业的。因此，我们十分重视参加第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的工作。中国青年选派了由三百三十二人组成的青年代表团，其中包括了中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的战斗英雄，工业的、交通事业的和治淮的劳动模范，中国各民族的和宗教青年的代表，青年工作的干部，篮球队、排球队，以及包括有歌剧队、演唱队、乐队、舞蹈队、杂技队等的文工团。此外，还有参加柏林“少年先锋队共和国”露营的中国少年儿童队队员。
    筹备联欢节的过程，正是中国抗美援朝运动积极展开的时期。在这一时期内，全中国青年在前线的战斗中和后方的爱国主义生产运动中，为和平事业贡献出自己全部的力量。在要求订立五大国和平公约和反对武装日本的签名和投票中，中国新民主主义青年团团员和广大青年起了积极的作用。这些工作，就是中国青年对和平联欢节的最好的献礼。选拔文艺节目和篮排球队选手的比赛，从今年三月就开始了。今年“五四”并曾在北京举行了文艺节目的联合大演出和全国篮排球的比赛。为了让世界青年朋友了解新中国的成长和中国青年为和平的努力，我们还准备了有四百张大幅照片的展览会。此外，全中国青年为各国青年和平战士准备了许多富有政治意义的礼品，其中有画着和平鸽的景泰蓝盘子，有织着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、皮克和毛主席像片的织锦，有和平鸽的徽章和雕刻。特别值得提到的礼品，还有中国人民志愿军的青年把缴获的美国炮弹筒所改制成的花瓶。
    中国青年对于参加联欢节是做了充分的准备工作的。
    联欢节是保卫和平伟大的胜利
    和严重的战斗
    第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的召开，正像世界民主青年联盟主席比林格尔在世界民主青联理事会的报告中所说的，它是全世界各国青年在保卫和平反对新的世界战争的挑拨者的斗争中友好团结的一个有力的示威；联欢节是一切国家、一切民族、
    一切有着不同的政治见解、不同的宗教信仰、以及千千万万青年团体的青年代表们的聚会和集结。所有的男女青年都在为了保卫他们的共同事业的斗争的愿望下团结起来了，这一个共同的事业就是：和平！
    爱好和平的青年们的和平的联欢不是一件简单的、轻而易举的事。正在积极扩充军备、武装西德和日本、疯狂地准备着战争的美英帝国主义和战争贩子们，他们对日益汹涌澎湃的世界人民的和平运动怀着极端的恐惧和仇恨，因此，许多资本主义国家、殖民地半殖民地国家的青年们，要派出他们的代表，来参加这样一个和平大示威，会遇到怎样的困难，是不难理解的。法国、意大利和南美的一些国家用警察袭击和阻拦参加联欢节的青年；美国、法国、意大利、印度、缅甸、叙利亚、伊朗、以色列以及日本等国家的政府对于出席联欢节的青年不发护照。伊朗有十几名青年被反动派打死打伤。英、法、意、瑞士的两千名青年代表，在经过奥地利前往柏林的途中，遇到美国占领当局的无理阻拦，美国军队野蛮地用枪托殴打，甚至用刺刀来刺伤他们，不给他们饭吃，不给他们水喝。两个女孩子被包围在铁路上因而被火车轧伤，十二个代表被打伤。西德的边境上布满了岗哨。西德豪夫（Hof）区，装甲车开枪打死三个德国青年。一个名叫魏纳·地格的社会民主党组织中的青年，也在边境上被赶入易北河淹死。在巴伐利亚边界上，西德警察袭击三百个去柏林的青年。有一人被杀害，有许多青年受伤，有数百名青年被捕。除此以外，美国帝国主义者还从“马歇尔计划”里拨款六十万美元，交给所谓“西柏林独立工会组织”，专门作破坏联欢节的费用。他们派出叫做“自由议会”的特务组织到柏林来做破坏工作，他们散出大批谣言，例如说“一百二十万青年都到西柏林去了”，“东柏林没有饭吃”。他们派出特务企图在代表的食物里放毒。
    这一些事实不仅说明了和平的敌人是怎样的野蛮无耻，同时也说明了这些国家的青年代表，要有怎样的勇敢和机智、克服多少严重的困难才能到达柏林。因此，这些国家的爱好和平的青年要参加联欢节，必须经过最严重的斗争。
    反动派的一切破坏阴谋，终于在青年保卫和平的决心面前完全破产了。他们的无耻暴行，激起了广大青年和人民的无比愤怒和抗议，并掀起了援助被迫害者的运动。许多青年经过多次的阻拦，但仍然想尽方法来到柏林。有的分散化装过境，有的从河里游泳过来。所有的欧洲亚洲国家，三十八个殖民地国家和十七个拉丁美洲国家都有代表参加联欢节。有三千代表从法国来，一千从英国来，六十人从美国来，而意大利青年为了答复反动政府的禁令，反把原来的一千名代表增加到一千三百名。在阿登纳反动政府野蛮压迫下的西德青年，冲过重重封锁，一路战斗来到柏林的还有三万五千多人。
    来到柏林的青年当中，有青年工人，青年农民，学生，青年职员，青年艺术家。他们的政治倾向有：共产主义者，社会党人，自由派，共和派，激进派，君主政体派，保守派等。他们的宗教信仰有：天主教和基督教的各派，佛教徒，回教徒以及正教徒。他们代表了体育、文化、学生、艺术家俱乐部，旅行家以及人道主义者的组织等等。这样多的政治宗教信仰不同的青年，来到柏林参加联欢节，证明了世界民主青年联盟的方针是正确的；这一方针就是：为了反对新的战争危险，保卫世界和平，就必须把一切具有善良愿望、反对战争的青年，不问他们的政治倾向、宗教信仰和社会成份，广泛地团结起来。事实已经证明：和平的愿望已是如此的深入人心，它已发出了不可抗拒的巨大的团结力量和战斗力量。
    这次联欢节比起前年在布达佩斯召开的第二届联欢节，增多了二十二个国家和一万五千名代表。这些新增加的国家是第一次和世界民主青年联盟建立了联系。这就有力地说明了世界和平力量有了巨大的增长，并且还在日益增长当中。
    德国青年伟大的进步和努力
    联欢节的胜利，不只是表现在有这样多的世界各国青年代表参加，而且表现在能够顺利地在柏林召开这一事实上。因为美帝国主义者正为了制造世界战争而加紧武装西德，柏林在欧洲就形成为和平力量与美帝国主义斗争的前哨阵地了。
    被苏联军队所解放并在苏联伟大的国际主义精神的帮助下，在德国统一社会党和皮克总统的领导下，德意志民主共和国青年有了极重大的进步。他们已经从法西斯民族仇恨的毒害下转向热爱和平、热爱各国人民了。德国青年和德国人民的伟大进步和努力，是联欢节能够在柏林顺利召开的主要因素之一。
    自由德国青年为了准备联欢节，完成了巨大的组织工作。他们动员在国营工业中的青年工人平均每人提前完成任务十九天，总共超额完成了六百二十万零九千一百九十五个工作日。德国青年在一个半月中举行了十万次和平会议和群众大会，有三百七十一万五千多人参加。他们发动了四百十四万五千八百三十九个青年共同署名写信给斯大林，保证德国青年将保卫和平到底。在运动中，有三十九万零五百八十三名男女青年和少年参加了自由德国青年联盟和少年先锋队，有一百零五万六千九百九十八个青年学习了“论列宁主义基础”。德国青年为了准备在柏林召开联欢节新建立了许多运动场，例如他们一百四十一天就完成了一座需时二年才能完工的斯大林大街的体育馆（可容六千多人）。他们还完成了许多游泳场、体育馆和清理废墟的工作。德国青年经常动员了各地的二千名青年工人组织成建设队在柏林参加建设工程。德国青年把柏林的街道和会场布置得很美丽，到处充满了节日的欢乐气氛。    他们为外国的二万五千青年客人准备了宿舍，为各地来的一百五十万青年布置了住所。他们在联欢节期间每天要准备三十五万公升的粮食，——而八月十日到十三日每天要供应七十五万公升的食品。为了运送各地青年到柏林来，专门开了五百九十二列专车，动员了六千辆载重卡车。柏林市每天有一万名妇女参加切削马铃薯。这些巨大的组织工作，形成了德国青年和德国人民为和平而斗争的热烈的政治动员。各国青年代表都感谢德国青年十分热情而周到的招待。全世界爱好和平的青年都将因德国青年的伟大进步而更感到和平的真理是不可战胜的力量。
    我们表达了中国青年永远忠实
    于和平事业的决心
    这里，我们就说到联欢节开幕后的情况。
    德意志民主共和国首都柏林的东部，在联欢节的两周间成了狂欢的城市，街头上拥挤着各种肤色各样服装的各国青年代表。到处飘扬着世界民主青年联盟、国际学生联合会和各国的旗帜；到处悬挂着各种文字的和平的标语，到处张挂着斯大林像和各国人民领袖像；到处洋溢着热情的歌声和友谊的欢呼；艺术表演和体育竞赛同时在许多处举行。
    除了联欢节的开幕典礼和闭幕典礼这两次极盛大的群众集会以外，八月十二日举行了二百万德国青年反对武装西德、要求在今年内缔结和约的伟大游行示威。在联欢节期间，还举行了许多次的和平集会，主要的是：五万女青年的“声援女青年和平战士示威大会”（九日），“征集和平签名有卓越成绩的青年大会”（十日），“殖民地青年日”（十六日），“世界学生日”（同时是国际学生联合会成立五周年纪念日，十七日），此外，四十二个国家两千名运动员参加的第十一届世界学生夏季运动会，也同时在柏林举行。所有这些集会，把全世界爱好和平的青年的声音，汇集成一个巨大无比的声音，这就是：和平！友谊！反对新的战争危险！立即缔结五大国和平公约！
    中国青年代表团参加了所有的这些和平集会，并忠实表达了中国青年永远忠于和平事业的决心。
    在八月五日乌布利希运动场举行的开幕典礼上，可容八万观众的看台和过道都挤满了人，各国代表团按照国名的字母次序进入会场，苏联、中国、朝鲜代表团受到群众最热烈的欢呼，“斯大林万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”的欢呼持久不息。在世界民主青年联盟主席比林格尔、国际学联主席格罗曼，德意志民主共和国总统皮克和苏联青年代表团长米哈依洛夫讲话之后，中国青年代表团团长冯文彬同志向大会讲话，他把中国青年向全世界青年和平战士的敬意和祝贺带给大会，他特别报告了中国青年为保卫世界和平所做的最重要的贡献——抗美援朝运动，并着重说明了中国青年的切身经验：“和平不能哀求，和平必须争取”。他在报告中告诉全世界青年：帝国主义殖民主义者在东方已经日益接近澈底的破产了。他代表中国青年向世界青年保证，中国青年将为和平事业贡献出自己的一切。
    在八月十九日的闭幕典礼上，苏中美英法五大国的青年走在游行队伍的最前列，在这次会议上，冯文彬同志再一次代表中国青年发表讲演，他指出了联欢节的伟大胜利，指出了联欢节大大提高了中国青年与全世界青年朋友为保卫世界和平并肩而战的决心和信心。他同时又坚决表示中国青年和中国人民，绝对不能容忍美帝国主义者单独对日媾和，重新复活日本帝国主义。中国青年坚决要求立即缔结五大国和平公约，并永远忠实于和平事业。
    在闭幕式上的宣誓，更把全世界青年和平战士的意志集中地表现出来了。誓词简短而十分有力。它以一百零四个国家的二百万青年的名义宣誓要尽自己全部力量防止新战争的爆发，加强各国人民和青年的友谊与和平合作，巩固与扩大青年的团结，为缔结五大国和平公约的运动而努力。
    “我们宣誓！我们宣誓！我们宣誓！”这重复了三次的誓词的结尾，是以数十种不同语言在柏林的马恩广场上向全世界的庄严宣告。它的声音将响彻全世界。它将使全世界青年和平战士从它获得更大的力量，并将使战争贩子们在它的前面发抖！
    在八月十二日举行的二百万德国青年大游行，极有力地表现了德国青年和德国人民反对武装西德、争取年内缔结和约的决心。游行的队伍不断地向各国青年代表欢呼，同时高举着“不给阿登纳当兵”，“不为重新军国主义化出一个钱”，“美国兵滚回去”的标语口号。他们还举着感谢苏联、向苏联青年学习的标语。三万五千名西德青年的队伍受到最热烈的欢迎。他们举着“德国必须统一”的标语。他们当中有曾经英勇地在被英国空军用作轰炸练习目标的黑尔郭兰岛上登陆并高悬起德国国旗的青年和平战士，有美因河流域的青年农民代表，他们抗议把他们的田地变为美国的打靶场。这次继续了八小时的德国青年和平力量大检阅，再一次表明德国青年争取统一、和平与民主的德国，为争取和平与国际友好团结的坚定意志。（未完待续）
