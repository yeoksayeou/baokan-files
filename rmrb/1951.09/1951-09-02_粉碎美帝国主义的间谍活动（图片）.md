    (I) In March 1948, U.S. special agent leader Paul Ruegg (former U.S. Embassy in China, Colonel Military Attaché in the Beiping Military Attaché Office) instructed Li An-tung (an Italian Fascist Party member who had consistently engaged in activities harmful to the people since coming to China in 1919) to collect intelligence for him and engage in espionage.
    (II) After accepting the order from his American master, Paul Ruegg, Li An-tung launched a large-scale operation, recruiting Japanese special agent Ryuichi Yamaguchi as an informant. He also directed Maddi Nori (Italian), Weizhi (French), Zheli (Italian), Gansner (German), Ma Xinqing (Beijing resident) and others, who were serving as special agents and spies for the U.S. government, to collect intelligence on our liberated areas' military, political, and economic affairs.
    (III) After the liberation of Beijing, Paul Ruegg continued to instruct Li An-tung to use his position as the Beijing agent of the Tianjin Lao Shichang Company as a cover for espionage activities. Li An-tung then instructed Ryuichi Yamaguchi to probe the resumes, addresses, telephone numbers, and car numbers of the heads of our Central People's Government, representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and those in charge of the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, compiling them into cards in order to carry out sabotage activities at opportune moments.

    粉碎美帝国主义的间谍活动

    （一）一九四八年三月，美国特务头目包瑞德（前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官）指使李安东（一九一九年来中国后就一贯作危害人民活动的意大利法西斯党党员）为他收集情报，进行间谍活动。
    （二）李安东接受了他的美国主子包瑞德的命令后就大肆活动，收罗日本特务山口隆一充当情报员。又指挥充当美国政府特务间谍的马迪懦（意大利人）、魏智（法国人）、哲立（意大利人）、甘斯纳（德国人）、马新清（北京市人）等，搜集有关我解放区军事和政治经济的情报。
    （三）北京解放后，包瑞德继续指使李安东，用天津老世昌公司北京代理人身份做掩护，进行间谍活动。李安东又指使山口隆一刺探我中央人民政府首长、中国人民政治协商会议代表及中国共产党、各民主党派、人民团体负责人的履历、住址、电话和汽车号码，制成卡片，伺机进行破坏活动。
