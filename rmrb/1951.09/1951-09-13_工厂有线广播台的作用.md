    The Role of Factory Wired Broadcasting Stations
    Meng Wen
    Since the General Administration of News of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Establishing a Radio Network" in April last year, the cultural and educational departments of many factories and mines have begun to establish radio stations or wired broadcasting stations in their units in accordance with the decision. These wired broadcasting stations generally operate dozens or hundreds of loudspeakers, broadcasting their own programs and relaying programs related to workers from local People's Broadcasting Stations on time. In many units, listening to the radio has become closely integrated with the political and cultural life of the broad masses of workers.

    Factory wired broadcasting stations have played a significant role in conducting current affairs propaganda, exchanging advanced experiences, and stimulating workers' production enthusiasm. They are not only welcomed by the broad masses of workers but also valued by Party, government, and trade union leadership organs at all levels. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the East China Industrial Department, the East China Textile Administration Bureau, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and other provincial and municipal governments and trade unions have all issued decisions and notices on establishing radio networks (stations) in factories and mining enterprises.

    Based on the facts of the past year or so, wired broadcasting stations in factories, mines, and enterprises have played a significant role in inspiring workers' production enthusiasm, assisting cultural and political learning, assisting factory management, and carrying out cultural and recreational activities.

    I. Inspiring the Production Enthusiasm of the Broad Masses of Workers. Loudspeakers installed in workshops or shops are excellent tools for propaganda and mobilization. The military representative of a factory under the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company called on everyone on the broadcast station last "August 1st" to celebrate Army Day by increasing production. As a result, the output the next day set the factory's highest record. The production situation of Shanghai Zhengtai Rubber Factory was not good in the past. The Liberation Daily and the Labor Daily had successively criticized it, but because most of the workers were illiterate, it did not have much effect. After the factory's broadcasting station was established, it repeatedly explained the criticisms in the newspaper to the workers. All the workers in the factory conducted criticism and self-criticism based on the broadcast and formulated a labor agreement, which greatly improved the production situation. The sand-turning workers of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau Electric Repair Factory created a new record for eliminating trachoma. The broadcasting station broadcast it in a timely manner. The fitters were anxious when they heard it and decided to create a new record. As a result, they exceeded the task by 11 percent. Thanks to the timely praise and encouragement from the broadcasting station, the entire factory completed the production task ahead of schedule. The Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory's broadcasting station played a major role in the factory's production competition. After the broadcasting station continuously praised Cui Jingfen, an inspector, and Shan Yuzhen, a cloth folder, who worked actively, all the workshops in the factory immediately sorted out the accumulated cloth for half a month. The amount of cloth sized per machine in the sizing room immediately increased from 300 pieces to 403 pieces per day.

    In the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea and Defend Our Homes and Country, the broadcasting station carried out current affairs propaganda and organized workers to launch challenge matches on the broadcasting station, which effectively promoted production. After the broadcasting station of a factory under the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company broadcast the news that the Chinese People's Volunteers had achieved their first major victory in Korea, the workers said after hearing it: "The front uses artillery, and we supply materials." With the workers' efforts, the production that day created the highest record. The broadcasting station of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau's Inspection Section combined its central work, and the vehicles repaired at the factory in December, No. 13665, were repaired within 10 hours on the same day, 86 hours ahead of the prescribed standard time, setting a new record.

    Factories in Shenyang, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places have organized workers' production competitions through broadcast rallies and wired broadcasting stations in various units, and have achieved remarkable results. The broadcast rallies held by the Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station alone, with the assistance of wired broadcasting stations in various factories, attracted more than 100 production units into the production competition upsurge, ensuring the completion of the production tasks for the first quarter of this year.

    II. Conducting Current Affairs Explanations and Assisting Political and Cultural Learning. Because there are many illiterate workers, it is difficult to read books and newspapers. For example, 80 percent of the workers in Jingxing mines are illiterate or have very little literacy. If all the workers in each unit are gathered to hold a factory-wide workers' meeting to explain current affairs and convey notices, it will not only delay production but also waste time. The broadcasting station solves this problem. When a factory under the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company opened, Minister Wang Daohan and others from the Ministry of Industry personally went to the broadcasting station to congratulate the workers. The workers said: "It is really convenient to have a broadcasting station. You don't have to run to assemble, it doesn't delay production time, and you can still listen to reports." Chairman Liu Changsheng of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions' speech on the People's Broadcasting Station was relayed by more than 50 factory broadcasting stations and listened to by more than 20,000 workers. The broadcasting station of Shanghai Service No. 2 Factory completed the task of mobilizing workers to donate 1 percent of their wages to relieve unemployed workers in one day. The person in charge of the factory said: "We haven't had time to mobilize yet, but everyone has completed the task. The broadcasting station is really great!" After the broadcasting station of Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing and Distribution Factory publicized the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai in early May last year, many workers immediately ran to the trade union to donate money. At the state-owned Shanghai No. 10 Cotton Textile Factory, special agents disguised as activists were arrested. The workers were unaware of the truth and discussed it one after another. The factory's broadcasting station immediately used radio dramas, dialogues, storytelling, and other forms to explain the incident, clarifying the truth and thereby improving the workers' political vigilance.

    In the literacy campaign, broadcasting stations in Tangshan Zhaogezhuang, Linxi, Qixin Magnetic Factory, and other places cooperated with workers' spare-time schools to conduct broadcast literacy. Teachers wrote the words on the blackboard under each loudspeaker, and the announcers taught them, which was very successful. In just a few months, some illiterate workers at the Qixin Magnetic Factory learned more than 300 words.

    III. Assisting Factory Management and Guiding Specific Work. All notices, announcements, and speeches are broadcast through the broadcasting station, which is fast, convenient, and effective. When the Shenyang Fuel Factory held "Night Air Defense Exercises," the inspection team reported the inspection work to the factory director by telephone. The factory director directed in the broadcasting room: "Group ×× moves quickly, does not leak light, very good," "Group ×× windows leak light," "Group ×× moves too chaotically," everyone could hear it and correct the shortcomings in time. The workers all said: "The broadcasting station has become our air defense headquarters!" Before some factories established broadcasting stations, everything had to be written on the blackboard newspaper. As a result, workers often did not pay attention, and meetings were often not fully attended. With a broadcasting station, everyone can hear it as long as they find a suitable time to broadcast it. The broadcasting station of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau's Inspection Section broadcasts the names of the disciplinary teams during meal times. Whoever hears their name prepares and ensures that they arrive on time. Liu Zhenying, a military university student, wrote a letter to the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory to find his sister Liu Zhenlan. Two people from the personnel department searched the list of 4,000 workers for a day but could not find her, but after broadcasting it once on the broadcasting station, the person had already arrived when a record was finished playing and was about to broadcast it for the second time. Last year, when raising winter clothes, Zhaogezhuang Mine did not hold many meetings. It mainly relied on broadcasting. After the workers learned about the significance of raising winter clothes from the broadcast, they automatically donated more than 20 million yuan.

    Hang Huilan from the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory returned from Moscow. She went to the broadcasting station to say hello to all the workers and report her thoughts. Workers who have opinions on administrative management write letters to the broadcasting station, and the trade union and administration also broadcast replies on the broadcasting station. In the past, workers at the Qiqihar No. 4 Clothing Factory waited for the general meeting to solve their problems, and the workers were very dissatisfied. Now that there is a broadcasting station, they can answer questions at any time, and everyone is very happy. One month, they received 84 rationalization proposals.

    IV. Assisting the Broad Masses of Workers in Carrying Out Cultural and Recreational Activities. Wired broadcasting stations have greatly enlivened the cultural and recreational activities of workers in various factories, mines, and enterprises. Many broadcasting stations relay song teaching programs from local People's Broadcasting Stations or broadcast such programs themselves, solving the difficulty of teaching songs in the unit. The broadcasting station of the Shanghai People's Printing Factory relays the song teaching programs of the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, enabling more than 1,000 workers to learn many new songs and establishing a broadcast orchestra and a broadcast drama troupe, uniting cultural and recreational activists around the factory's broadcasting station. When Shanghai Silk Spinning No. 1 Factory studied democratic management, it composed a song and repeatedly taught it on the broadcasting station. Everyone learned the song and understood the meaning of democratic management. The broadcasting station of Qiqihar Caustic Soda Factory enlivened the lives of workers through various forms of cultural and recreational activities. Before the broadcasting station was established, some workers often went to the streets and small restaurants or went for a stroll in the evening when they had nothing to do. After the broadcasting station was established, few people went to the streets, and everyone became addicted to listening. More than 300 people from the state-owned Shanghai No. 10 Cotton Textile Factory expressed their opinions to the broadcasting station, and most of them requested to broadcast more local operas and revolutionary songs. In the entertainment programs organized by the factory broadcasting station of Shanghai State Cotton No. 10 Factory, workers took turns singing a section, everyone was enthusiastic, and finally a Yue opera group was established. The broadcasting station of the Shanghai People's Printing Factory introduces new movies every week and gives away preferential tickets at the same time, which is very popular.

    The role of wired broadcasting stations in factories and mines is very significant. Radio has entered the lives of Chinese workers and is carrying out large-scale propaganda and education work.

    工厂有线广播台的作用
    孟文
    去年四月中央人民政府新闻总署发布“关于建立广播收音网的决定”以后，许多工厂、矿山的文教部门，就按照决定，开始在本单位建立了收音站或是有线广播台。这些有线广播台，一般的都带动几十个或百来个喇叭，按时播送他们自己的节目和转播各地人民广播电台有关职工的节目。在许多单位，收听广播已经同广大职工的政治文化生活紧密地结合了起来。
    工厂有线广播台在进行时事宣传、交流先进经验，和鼓动职工生产情绪方面，都起了很大的作用。它不但受到广大职工的欢迎，而且得到了各级党政和职工领导机关的重视。东北总工会、东北人民政府工业部、中共上海市委宣传部、上海总工会、华东工业部、华东纺织管理局、天津市人民政府、市总工会及其他省市政府和工会等，都曾发布了在厂矿企业中建立收音网（站）的决定与通知。
    根据一年多来的事实，工厂、矿山、企业中的有线广播台，在鼓舞职工的生产热情，帮助文化、政治学习，辅助工厂管理和开展文艺娱乐活动等方面，都起了很大的作用。
    一、鼓舞广大职工的生产热情。装置在工房或车间里的喇叭，是出色的宣传鼓动工具。上海钢铁公司某厂军代表，去年“八一”，在广播台上号召大家以提高生产来庆祝建军节，结果第二天产量即创该厂的最高纪录。上海正泰橡胶厂过去生产情况不好，解放日报和劳动报，曾先后提出批评，但由于工人们多不识字，不起多大作用。该厂广播台建立后，将报上的批评，反复的向工友们解说，全厂职工，根据广播进行了批评与自我批评，订立了劳动公约，大大改善了生产情况。齐齐哈尔铁路局电务修缮厂翻沙组工友，创出了消灭沙眼的新纪录，广播台及时广播了，钳工组一听着了急，决心要创出新纪录，结果超过任务百分之十一。由于广播台及时表扬鼓励，全厂提前完成生产任务。天津棉纺四厂广播台在该厂生产竞赛中起了很大作用。广播台连续表扬了积极工作的验布工人崔静芬和叠布工人单玉珍以后，该厂各车间马上将半月来积压的布匹都给整理好了，浆纱间每天每台机子从浆三百匹布立即提高到四百零三匹。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，广播台进行了时事宣传和组织工友在广播台展开挑战应战，有力地推动了生产。上海钢铁公司某厂广播台广播了中国人民志愿军在朝鲜取得首次大捷的消息后，工人们听了说：“前方用大炮，我们供材料。”工人们一鼓劲，那一天的生产创造了最高纪录。齐齐哈尔铁路局检车段的广播结合了中心工作，十二月入厂修理的车辆攵一三六六五号，当天十小时内就修理好了，比规定标准时间提前八十六小时，创造新纪录。
    沈阳、天津、上海等地工厂，通过广播会和各单位的有线广播台，组织职工生产竞赛，都得到了显著的成绩。仅沈阳人民电台举办的广播会，在各工厂有线广播台的协助下，就有百余生产单位投入了生产竞赛热潮，保证完成了本年第一季度的生产任务。
    二、进行时事讲解和帮助政治文化学习。因为工人中文盲比较多，阅读书报感到困难，如井陉各矿工人们有百分之八十是不识字和识字很少的。如把各个单位工人都集合起来召开全厂工人大会，讲解时事，传达通知，既耽误生产，又浪费时间。有了广播台，就解决了这个问题。上海钢铁公司某厂在开幕时，工业部汪道涵部长等亲自到广播台向工人道贺，工友们说：“有了广播台真便利，不要跑步集合，不耽误生产时间，一样听报告。”上海总工会刘长胜主席在人民电台的讲话，有五十多个工厂广播台转播，有二万多工人收听。上海服务二厂的广播台，在一天内完成了拿百分之一的工资救济失业工人的动员任务。工厂负责人说：“我们还没有来得及动员，大家倒完成任务了，广播台真行！”天津汽车制配厂广播台去年五月初宣传响应全国总工会号召救济上海失业工人以后，立刻就有许多工友跑到工会去捐钱。国营上海第十棉纺织厂里逮捕了以积极面貌出现的特务分子，工友不明真相，纷纷议论，该厂广播台马上针对这件事用广播剧、对话、说书等形式，进行解释，使真相大白，因而提高了工人的政治警惕性。
    在识字运动中，唐山赵各庄、林西、启新磁厂等广播台配合工人业余学校，进行了广播识字。教员把字写在每个喇叭下面的黑板上，由播音员来教，很有成绩。启新磁厂在短短的几个月中，有的文盲工友就认识了三百多字。
    三、帮助工厂管理与指导具体工作。凡是通知、布告、讲话，通过广播台，既迅速又方便，效果很大。沈阳燃料厂在举行“夜间防空演习”的时候，检查组用电话向厂长报告检查工作情况，厂长在广播室里指挥：“××组动作快，不漏光，很好”，“××组窗户漏光”，“××组动作太乱”，大家都能听到，并及时纠正缺点。工友们都说：“广播台变成了我们防空司令部啦！”有些工厂在建立广播台之前，有什么事情都要写在黑板报上，结果，工友们多不注意，开会时常常到不齐。有了广播台之后，只要找个适当时间广播一下，大家全都听到了。齐齐哈尔铁路局检车段广播台，在吃饭的时候，广播纠察队的名单，谁听到了自己的名字谁就准备好，管保按时候到齐。军大学生刘振英写信到国营上海第一棉纺织厂找他妹妹刘震兰，人事科两个人在四千工友名册中查了一天没查出，可是在广播台上播了一遍，一张唱片放完正要播第二遍的时候，人已经来了。去年在捐募寒衣时，赵各庄矿就没有开过几次会，主要靠广播，职工们从广播里知道了捐募寒衣的意义后，就自动地捐款两千多万元。
    国营上海第一棉纺织厂杭惠兰从莫斯科回来，她就到广播台去给全厂职工问好，并且报告她的感想。工人们对行政管理有了意见，就写信给广播台，工会和行政也在广播台上播音答复。齐齐哈尔市第四被服厂，过去工友提意见都等到开大会时一块解决，工人挺不满意。有了广播台可以随时解答了，大家挺高兴，有一个月就收到合理化建议八十四件。
    四、辅助广大职工开展文化娱乐活动。有线广播台大大活跃了各工厂、矿山、企业工人的文化娱乐活动。很多广播台转播当地人民广播电台的教歌节目或者自己播送这样节目，解决了该单位教歌的困难。上海人民印刷厂广播台转播上海人民广播电台教歌节目，使一千多工人学会了许多新歌，并且成立了广播乐团和广播剧团，把文娱工作的积极分子团结在工厂广播台周围。上海绢纺一厂学习民主管理时，编了一首歌在广播台上反复教唱，大家把歌学会了，民主管理的意思也弄懂了。齐齐哈尔火碱厂广播台通过各种文娱形式活跃职工生活，在未建立广播台前，有的工友晚间没事，常上街进小馆或是蹓跶玩去，有了广播台后，很少有人上街了，大家都听上瘾了。国营上海第十棉纺织厂有三百多人向广播台提出了意见，大多数要求多播地方剧和革命歌曲。上海国棉十厂工厂广播台组织的娱乐节目中，工友们你挑我唱一段，我挑你唱一段，大家兴致勃勃，最后成立了越剧组。上海人民印刷厂的广播台每周介绍新电影，同时赠送优待券，很受欢迎。
    工厂、矿山的有线广播台的作用是很显著的，无线电已走进我国工人的生活中，并执行着巨大规模的宣传教育工作。
