The public security officer of Baodun Village, Jingxian County, uses deceptive means
Forces Shen Meizi to marry his younger brother
Relevant departments should quickly investigate the situation and handle it appropriately
In Shangfang Village, First District, Jingxian County, Southern Anhui Province, public security officer Wang Dakuaizi and Women's Federation Director She Meini and others used deceptive means to force the woman Shen Meizi to marry Wang Xiaokuaizi, which seriously violated the principle of freedom of marriage.

Shen Meizi is twenty-one years old this year. When she was three years old, she became a child bride in Xu Xiaomao's family in Baodun Village. She terminated the marriage contract last October. Soon, She Meini, the director of the Women's Federation in Baodun Village, introduced Shen Meizi to Wang Dakuaizi, the village's public security officer, to discuss marriage. Meizi thought Dakuaizi was a good person, so she agreed to the marriage. Last October, the Wang family prepared to hold a wedding and asked Meizi to go to the district government with her fiancé to obtain a marriage certificate. However, the fiancé was not Dakuaizi, but Xiaokuaizi. Xiaokuaizi is Dakuaizi's younger brother and has ascites. When Meizi saw that the person had changed, she did not collect the marriage certificate. After returning home, Kuaizi's mother forced Meizi to hold a wedding with Xiaokuaizi; Meizi firmly refused, but unable to resist, she reluctantly got married. Meizi was very dissatisfied, and her mother-in-law beat her up for this, and cursed: "Buying fields produces rice, marrying a daughter-in-law is to have a son!" Meizi couldn't bear the anger and asked the village cadres to divorce. The village cadres said: "We introduced you to get married, and now you want us to get you divorced. It's not easy for us to manage. You go to the district!" Meizi ran to the district, and the district cadres said: "You got married without a marriage certificate, looking down on the government. You didn't go through us to get married, so we don't care now. You go and find the village cadres to solve it!" Meizi had no choice but to run back to her parents' home. As soon as she entered the door, her father said: "Why are you back again? Go back quickly!" Meizi stayed for two days and returned to her husband's house. When her mother-in-law saw her, she immediately stripped her clothes off, locked the door, and beat her severely, leaving her covered in injuries. A few days later, she couldn't bear it anymore at her husband's house and returned to her parents' home again. She said to her father: "I would rather die than go to my husband's house again." Meizi's father said: "I can't support you either. Now there is freedom of marriage. If you want a divorce, go and get it yourself!" Meizi found Chen Wenying, the chairman of the Women's Representative Conference in Shangfang Village, and asked for help in resolving the marriage issue. Chen Wenying took Meizi to the district. The district cadres said that Meizi got married in the Sixth District and they didn't know the situation, so she should go to the Sixth District to solve it. In this way, Meizi's marriage problem has been dragging on until now and has not been resolved.

The act of Baodun Village Public Security Officer Wang Dakuaizi and Women's Federation Director She Meini deceiving Shen Meizi is illegal and should be punished; the district and village government cadres' failure to support Meizi's divorce request and their mutual evasion of responsibility is also an irresponsible attitude. The Sixth District People's Government of Jingxian County should make a review and quickly handle Meizi's marriage problem.

    泾县宝墩村公安员采用欺骗手段
    强使沈梅子和他弟弟结婚
    有关部门应迅速查明情况适当加以处理
    皖南泾县一区上坊村公安员王大胯子、妇联会主任佘妹妮等采用欺骗手段迫使妇女沈梅子与王小胯子结婚，严重违反婚姻自主的原则。
    沈梅子今年二十一岁，三岁时给宝墩村徐小毛做童养媳，去年十月解除了婚约。不久，宝墩村妇联会主任佘妹妮将沈梅子介绍与该村公安员王大胯子认识，谈论婚事。梅子见大胯子人还不错，就答应了婚事。去年十月，王家准备办喜事，便让梅子到区政府与未婚夫领取结婚证书。但是，未婚夫不是大胯子，却变成了小胯子。小胯子是大胯子的弟弟，有大肚子病。梅子见换了人，没领结婚证书。回家后，胯子的母亲强迫梅子与小胯子举行婚礼；梅子坚决不肯，但抵抗不过，就马马虎虎地结了婚。梅子很不满意，他婆婆为此痛打了她一顿，还骂道：“买田生稻子，讨媳妇为了抱儿子！”梅子受气不过，便向村干部提出离婚要求。村干部却说：“我们给你介绍结婚，现在又叫我们给你办离婚，我们不好管，你到区里去吧！”梅子跑到区里，区干部说：“你们结婚不领结婚证，看不起政府，结婚也不经过我们，现在我们不管，你去找村干部解决！”梅子没办法，跑回了娘家。一进门，她父亲就说：“你怎么又回来了？赶快回去！”梅子住了两天，又回了婆家。婆婆见了，马上把她的衣服剥光，关起门来毒打，打得遍身是伤。几天以后，她在婆家实在受不住了，又回到娘家。她对父亲说：“死也不到婆家去了。”梅子父亲说：“我也不能养活你，现在婚姻自由，你要离婚，你自己去离吧！”梅子找到上坊村妇女代表会主席陈文英，请求帮助解决婚姻问题。陈文英带梅子到区里，区干部说梅子是在六区结的婚，情况不了解，要她还是到六区去解决。就这样，梅子的婚姻问题一直拖到现在还没有解决。
    宝墩村公安员王大胯子与妇联会主任佘妹妮欺骗沈梅子的行为，是违法的，应该受到处分；区、村政府干部不支持梅子的离婚要求，互相推诿，也是一种不负责任的态度。泾县第六区人民政府应作检讨，并迅速处理梅子的婚姻问题。
