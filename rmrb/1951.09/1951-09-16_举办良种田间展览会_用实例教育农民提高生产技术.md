    Hold Field Exhibition of Improved Varieties
    Educate Farmers with Examples to Improve Production Technology
    The Nanjing Seed Station of the Seed Management Office of the East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Suburban Administrative Office of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government held a "Field Exhibition of Improved Rice Varieties" in mid-August in the fields where the "Zhongnong No. 4" improved rice variety was planted in the western suburbs of Nanjing. The crops in this field grew exceptionally well, with long and large rice ears containing many grains (each ear had more than three hundred grains), almost twice as many as the old varieties. Hundreds of red and green flags were inserted around the exhibition field, and explanatory signs were placed at the head of the field, indicating the records of cultivation and fertilization, with dedicated personnel responsible for explanations. Nearly two thousand farmers visited during the three days. This exhibition is a new way to promote improved varieties. It powerfully educated the visiting farmers with facts that to achieve increased production, it is not enough to rely solely on deep plowing and careful cultivation; it is necessary to select superior varieties. For example, a farmer in Xiaowei Village who insisted on planting the old rice variety "Deng Deng Qi" applied sixteen loads of yellow manure to his two mu of land, weeded twice, and plowed three times and harrowed six times, but the yield per mu was still two to three hundred jin less than that of the new variety (estimated). Therefore, I suggest: First, I hope that agricultural and forestry departments and relevant agencies in various regions will hold more such vivid "field exhibitions" in the future so that the superior varieties of various crops can be rapidly promoted. Many farmers still hold old views on improving field operation methods and adopting new varieties. For example, there is a rice variety in northern Jiangsu called "Dafengguang" (Great Scenery). Before the grains mature and are harvested, the grains fall off easily when encountering a strong wind, but ordinary farmers still like to plant it because it has certain advantages (such as more grain), thinking that "it is the business of the God of Heaven to blow a strong wind, and no one can control it." As the saying goes, "It is not to be afraid of not knowing the goods, but to be afraid of not comparing goods." This "field exhibition" is an exhibition of "comparing goods." The farmers who visited this exhibition immediately booked the new variety. They said: Putting in the same effort, investing the same capital, and receiving double the interest, who wouldn't do such a good thing? Second, I hope that students and experts from various agricultural colleges can participate in such exhibitions and provide better scientific operation methods so that improved varieties can have greater yields in the future. Vigorously promoting improved varieties and improving operation methods will bring about a great change in China's economic construction.

### 举办良种田间展览会  用实例教育农民提高生产技术

    举办良种田间展览会
    用实例教育农民提高生产技术
    华东农林部种子管理所南京种子站和南京市人民政府郊区行政办事处，于八月中旬，在南京西郊种植
    “中农四号”水稻良种的田地里举办了“良种水稻田间展览会”。这块田里的庄稼长得特别好，稻穗子长，粒大且多（每个穗子都有三百多粒稻子），比旧种稻粒几乎多一倍。展览田场四周插了数百面红绿彩旗，田头上插着说明牌，标明耕种施肥的记录，并由专人负责讲解。在三天中，前往参观的农民近两千人。这种展览会是推广良种的一个新方式。它用事实强有力地教育了参观的农民，要达到增产的目的，单靠深耕细作还不行，必须要选种优良的品种。例如小圩村有一个坚持种旧稻种“等等齐”的农民，他的两亩地上，上了十六担黄粪，除草二次，三耕六耙，每亩地收获量仍比新种少收二百斤到三百斤（估计数）。因此，我建议：一、希望各地农林部门与有关机关，在今后多举办这种活生生的“田间展览会”，使各种农作物的优良品种得以迅速推广。许多农民在改善田间操作方法与采用新品种上，还保有旧观点。如苏北有一种稻种叫“大风光”，在结实收割前，一遇大风就掉粒，但一般农民因为它有某些优点（如结实较多），还很喜欢种它，认为“刮大风是天老爷的事，谁也管不了”。俗语说：“不怕不识货，就怕货比货”，这种“田间展览会”就是一个“货比货”的展览会。参观过这次展览会的农民，都立即预约了新种。他们说：出一样力气，下一样本钱，收双倍利息，这样的好事谁不干？二、希望各农业专科学校的学生与专家，能参与这样的展览会，提供更好的科学的操作方法，使良种在今后能有更大的收获量。大力推广良种，改善操作方法，将使新中国的经济建设起一个很大的变化。
