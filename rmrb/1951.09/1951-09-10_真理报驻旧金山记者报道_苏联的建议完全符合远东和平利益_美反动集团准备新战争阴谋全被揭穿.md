    Truth Newspaper Correspondent in San Francisco Reports

    Soviet Proposals Fully Accord with the Interests of Peace in the Far East
    US Reactionary Groups' New War Conspiracy Fully Exposed
    Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: TASS Moscow, September 8th - The Truth newspaper published today an article by its San Francisco correspondent, Filipov, entitled "The Tricks of the Enemies of Peace Are Exposed".

    Filipov wrote: The entire process of the San Francisco conference once again confirmed that the purpose of the conference was in no way related to the issue of maintaining peace. The sole purpose, according to the organizers' plan, was to sign and seal the separate peace treaty with Japan drafted by the United States and Britain. This treaty was not for a peaceful resolution of the Japanese problem, but for preparing and launching a new war in the Far East.

    The objective determined the means they chose. The American ruling clique greatly violated the procedures for preparing a peace treaty with Japan as determined by the Potsdam Agreement, subordinating the preparation of the treaty to its aggressive conspiracy, and continued to do so illegally and brazenly at the San Francisco conference.

    The author further pointed out: Whether during the preparation period of the San Francisco conference or during the conference itself, American representatives have continuously made remarks to influence the countries invited to participate in the conference. At the same time, American diplomats exerted off-site pressure on the representatives attending the conference, forcing them to agree to sign the peace treaty with Japan drafted by Washington and London. American newspapers made no secret of the fact that two days before the opening of the conference, Acheson and Dulles, representatives of the American delegation, earnestly "admonished" the delegations of several countries.

    The purpose of the backstage activities of American diplomats was also to force the representatives attending the conference to accept the rules of procedure for the conference manufactured by the American and British delegations.

    American newspapers openly admitted that the rules of procedure adopted at the meeting were aimed at hindering the activities of the Soviet delegation. However, no matter how hard the organizers of the conference tried, they still failed to prevent the Soviet delegation from speaking. The speech by Gromyko, the head of the Soviet delegation, received great attention from all the representatives at the conference.

    Filipov continued: The Soviet representative revealed the true meaning of the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan. He convincingly proved that this treaty did not provide any guarantees against the revival of Japanese militarism or against Japan being transformed into an aggressive country, but rather created the preconditions for the revival of Japanese militarism and the repetition of Japanese aggression.

    The draft, under the pretext of self-defense, stipulates that Japan and the United States form an aggressive military alliance. At the same time, it paves the way for Japan to participate in other Far Eastern aggressive blocs created under the aegis of the United States in the future.

    This draft treaty, manufactured in the State Department, does not contain any provisions on the democratization of Japan or guarantees of the democratic rights of the Japanese people.

    The economic clauses of the draft are aimed at making Japan economically dependent on foreign monopoly capital (mainly American), which has already acquired many privileges during Japan's occupation. At the same time, the draft peace treaty ignores the legitimate demands of countries that have suffered from Japanese occupation for compensation for damages suffered.

    On the instructions of the Soviet government, the Soviet delegation submitted amendments to the draft treaty proposed by the US and British governments for consideration by the conference. The Soviet proposals take into account the genuine interests of all countries that participated in the war against Japan, as well as the interests of the Japanese people. These proposals fully conform to the task of seeking a peaceful resolution in the Far East and help to strengthen the cause of world peace.

    Therefore, the attention of the conference was immediately focused on the statement of the Soviet delegation, which is not surprising. In the lounges and in the press, people were enthusiastically discussing this statement. Even the reactionary American newspapers could not silence this discussion. No matter how the American newspapers tried to distort the essence of the Soviet proposals, the news in the newspapers showed the serious anxiety caused by the statement of the Soviet delegation among the American ruling groups and the impression created by the speech.

    Filipov concluded by saying: Some countries, including Arab countries, although they did not dare to openly oppose this US-British draft peace treaty with Japan, expressed secret dissatisfaction; the press expects the United States to exercise new pressure on these countries.

### 真理报驻旧金山记者报道  苏联的建议完全符合远东和平利益  美反动集团准备新战争阴谋全被揭穿

    真理报驻旧金山记者报道
    苏联的建议完全符合远东和平利益
    美反动集团准备新战争阴谋全被揭穿
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日电：真理报今日发表该报驻旧金山记者费利波夫的文章，题为“和平敌人的诡计被揭穿了”。
    费利波夫写道：旧金山会议的整个进程再次证实，会议的目的是与维护和平的问题毫不相干的。会议的唯一目的，依照其组织者的策划，就是在美英两国制造的单独对日和约草案上签字盖章，这个和约并不是为了和平解决日本问题，而是为了在远东准备和发动新战争。
    目的决定了他们所选择的手段。美国统治集团大大违反了波茨坦协定所确定的准备对日和约的程序，使和约的准备工作从属于它的侵略阴谋，在旧金山会议上，仍然继续这样非法地蛮干。
    作者更指出：无论在旧金山会议的准备期间，或者是在会议当中，美国代表都不断地发表言论，影响被邀参加会议的国家。同时，美国外交官又对出席会议的代表施以会外压力，迫使他们答应签署华盛顿和伦敦制就的对日和约。美国报纸毫不掩饰：在会议开幕前两天，艾奇逊和美国代表团代表杜勒斯谆谆地“训诫”若干国家的代表团。
    美国外交人员的幕后活动，目的也是在于迫使参加会议的代表接受美国和英国代表团制造的会议议事规则。
    美国报纸公开承认，会上通过的议事规则，目的在于阻挠苏联代表团的活动。然而，不管会议的组织者费了多大的力气，他们仍未能阻止苏联代表团的发言。苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯的发言，受到了会议全体代表的极大重视。
    费利波夫继续说：苏联代表揭露了美英对日和约草案的真正意义。他令人信服地证明，这个和约根本谈不到保证防止日本军国主义的复活及防止日本被变为侵略国家，而是制造了日本军国主义复活及日本侵略重演的先决条件。
    这个草案以自卫为藉口，规定日本和美国结成侵略性的军事联盟。同时为日本铺平了道路，使它今后能够参加在美国卵翼下创立的其他远东侵略集团。
    这个在国务院里制造的和约草案，其中并没有关于日本民主化的条款或是关于日本人民的民主权利的保证。
    草案的经济条款，其宗旨是使日本在经济上倚赖外国垄断资本（主要是美国的），它们在日本被占领期间已经取得不少特权了。同时，和约草案无视曾遭受日本占领之害的国家索取遭受损害的赔偿的合法要求。
    苏联代表团奉苏联政府的训令，对美国和英国政府提出的和约草案，提出了修正案供大会考虑。苏联的建议考虑到全体曾参与对日作战国家的真正利益，同时也考虑到日本人民的利益。这些建议完全符合求得远东和平解决的任务，并有助于加强世界和平的事业。
    因此，会议的注意力马上集中在苏联代表团的声明上，实在是不足为奇的。在休息室内和新闻界，人们都在热烈地讨论这个声明。即使美国的反动报纸也不能使这种讨论静下来。不管美国报纸如何企图歪曲苏联建议的本质，但报纸上的消息却说明了苏联代表团的声明在美国统治集团当中引起的严重焦虑以及这个发言所造成的印象。
    费利波夫最后说：某些国家，包括阿拉伯国家在内，虽然不敢公开反对这个美英的对日和约草案，但是却表示了暗中的不满；报界预料美国将对这些国家行使新的压力。
