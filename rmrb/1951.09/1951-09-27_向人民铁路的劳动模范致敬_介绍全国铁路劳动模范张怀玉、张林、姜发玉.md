Saluting the Labor Models of the People's Railway
    —Introducing National Railway Labor Models Zhang Huaiyu, Zhang Lin, and Jiang Fayu
    The 467 delegates attending this National Railway Labor Model Representative Conference are all outstanding models who have made remarkable achievements in the construction of the people's railway over the past two years. Many of them have displayed a high degree of creativity, many have diligently studied advanced Soviet experiences, and many have united the worker masses, so they have all greatly increased production and performed their work exceptionally well.
    Zhang Huaiyu, a sand-molding worker at the Jinan Railway Factory, is an excellent representative of workers who have demonstrated creativity, improved tools, and increased production efficiency. He improved the tool for making sand molds for type B brake shoes, simplifying the work and increasing production nearly tenfold compared to the prescribed standard. Type B brake shoes are essential equipment for braking train cars. Because these parts rub against the wheels when stopping, they are easily worn and consumed in large quantities. The original standard for the Jinan Railway Factory was 15 boxes per person per day, which was already nearly double the 8 boxes per person per day during the Japanese puppet regime, but it was still not enough to meet demand. Zhang Huaiyu thought, "I am a member of the New Democratic Youth League, I should take the lead in increasing the production of brake shoes!" But he did not immediately think of improving production tools. At first, he used the method of increasing labor intensity, and when the daily output increased from 15 boxes to 96 boxes, the labor intensity had reached its limit and could not be increased further. At this time, Wang Changhua of the Jiulonggang Factory created a new record of 120 boxes. Only then did Zhang Huaiyu think:
    "Brute force won't work, we need to improve the tools to make further progress!" So he began to study the improvement of tools and increased production to 103 boxes again. But he still couldn't catch up with Wang Changhua. Zhang Huaiyu pondered day and night. He first analyzed how many movements were involved in making a box of brake shoes (two pieces), and which movements were unreasonable and should be eliminated. He calculated that there were a total of fourteen movements, and found that it was time-consuming to put the two wooden molds twice when making the bottom sand mold, and it was also time-consuming to compact the sand and level the sand around after putting the wooden molds in place. Then he focused on studying how to eliminate these time-consuming movements. After more than ten days of thinking and experimenting, Zhang Huaiyu finally came up with the idea of ​​nailing the two wooden molds to a wooden board with everyone's help in December last year. With this wooden board, the wooden mold for making two brake shoes only needs to be put in once, and it is tight without compacting the sand, and the surrounding sand is flat without scraping. The number of movements was reduced from fourteen to nine, and the time was greatly saved. Once, he made 240 boxes in one day. Now he can often maintain a record of 160 boxes per day, and the brake shoes he casts have no sand holes. In the past, the production of their entire group of thirteen people was still in short supply, but now only three people can produce enough to use. Zhang Huaiyu's method has been推广 (tuī guǎng - promoted) to railway factories in Tangshan, Changxindian, Qingdao, Puzhen, etc. The daily output of each factory has increased from 20 boxes per person to 150-160 boxes.
    Zhang Lin, Assistant Director of the Personnel Department of the China Changchun Railway Bureau and introducer of the Kovalev work method, is a model of actively learning advanced Soviet experiences to improve production. He is a worker cadre cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party and a disabled person who has nearly lost his eyesight in the Liberation War. But he still worked hard to learn the advanced Soviet experience in running railways from Soviet books and newspapers and from Soviet experts. He often thought: The people's railway is a socialist enterprise, and it can only be run well quickly by working hard to learn from the Big Brother. Therefore, he regarded learning from the Soviet Union as a political task. Although his eyes were nearly blind, he was inspired by Paul Kochakin and came up with the idea of ​​using a special magnifying glass to read books and newspapers word by word. Although he often spent the whole Sunday reading, he often only read four or five pages, but he was not discouraged. There were many places in Soviet books and newspapers that he did not understand and needed to ask Soviet experts for advice. Last winter, Zhang Lin went to Dalian on a business trip. While sitting on the train reading "The Steam Whistle" (a Soviet newspaper), he suddenly found an article introducing the Kovalev work method. As soon as he saw it was an introduction to advanced experience, he used his special magnifying glass to read it word by word. Although the train was shaking, it was as if a magnet on the "Steam Whistle" had attracted him, and he concentrated on reading it for ten hours until he finished the article. After returning to Harbin, Zhang Lin immediately ran to the Soviet expert and asked the Soviet expert to re-explain the Kovalev work method to him. Then he translated the article into Chinese, obtained the consent of the leaders of the China Changchun Railway Bureau, and printed and distributed it to the front lines. He saw that there was no movement a month after the article was distributed, so he personally went to the Harbin Railway Factory to make a report and mobilize everyone to learn. When Li Shusen, the director of the mechanical branch of the factory, achieved results in the Zhu Shiqing group by implementing the Kovalev work method, he suggested that the China Changchun Railway Bureau send Li Shusen and others to various sub-bureaus to make reports. He believed that only when everyone adopted this method and achieved results could it be considered a true learning of this method. Therefore, while organizing reports, he also wrote articles in newspapers to promote it. It was very difficult for him to write articles about learning advanced Soviet experience. Not only did he have to think about the entire content and structure, but he also had to think about every sentence and word in his mind, and then dictate it to others to record. Then he had to carefully study it and ask Soviet experts to correct it, so he often lost sleep for several nights to write an article. But he received great rewards and comfort: all units of the China Changchun Railway Bureau universally adopted this method and achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from January to May of this year, after the units of the China Changchun Railway Bureau adopted the Kovalev work method, they discovered and promoted a total of two hundred and several dozen excellent operation methods, which generally improved production efficiency. For example, the output of oxygen cylinder caps at the Harbin Railway Factory increased by 668 percent. Other state-owned enterprises in Northeast China have also achieved great results after promoting the Kovalev work method.
    Jiang Fayu, the company commander of the Railway Technical Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, is an outstanding example of being good at relying on the masses, absorbing and mobilizing the wisdom of the masses, and doing a good job. Before starting a job, he often holds meetings to study and carefully plan before starting to do it. So they have never done rework. Once, they used a train to pull the blasted steel beam on a certain bridge, but because the steel beam was stuck by the bridge pier, it took three whole nights to pull it open. So he held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" and asked everyone to think of a way. A squad leader suggested using splints to support the joint of the steel beam, and then using a winch to lift it. As a result, they adopted this method and pulled the steel beam open. Jiang Fayu attached great importance to improving the political and technical level of the masses to give play to the wisdom of the masses, so as to enrich his own wisdom. In the tense war environment on the Korean front, he often used his spare time to give lessons to the soldiers, explaining scientific knowledge of engineering. He also organized new and old soldiers to study in the way of apprenticeships, and also organized "study inspection teams" to conduct regular supervision. So the soldiers in his company are very resourceful, and therefore their company is called the "Zhuge Liang Company." Jiang Fayu relied closely on the Zhuge Liangs in the company to complete the work tasks. Once, a railway bridge was shaken by a bomb explosion, and on the 30-meter-long bridge, two steel rails with sleepers became a large bow,甩出 (shuǎi chū - flung out) of their original position. The inside of the bow was still on the bridge, but the outside was甩出 (shuǎi chū - flung out) of the bridge, and the vertex was more than one meter away from the bridge edge on the same side. How can we straighten this big bow and put it back in its original position! Jiang Fayu wanted to remove the steel rails and re-lay them, but how could he remove the side甩出 (shuǎi chū - flung out) of the bridge body that was in the air? And if it is removed and re-laid, it will take a lot of time, what should we do if we interrupt the urgent military transportation? Jiang Fayu was very anxious. Just then, a soldier - an old track worker Liu Peigang came up with a solution. He said, "Company Commander, haven't you told us about the principles of mechanics?" He pointed to the steel rail on the inside of the bow and said:
    "Put steel splints underneath, then use a pry bar to pry, and pull with a rope, this one will come over, and that one and the sleepers will come over with it, and it will be straight when it comes over!" Jiang Fayu adopted this suggestion and quickly restored the railway bridge to traffic.
    The railway workers of New China, like Zhang Huaiyu, Zhang Lin, and Jiang Fayu, wholeheartedly use all kinds of methods to improve production efficiency and transportation efficiency and run the people's railway well. They are the meritorious servants of the people, and they are respected by the people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    向人民铁路的劳动模范致敬
    ——介绍全国铁路劳动模范张怀玉、张林、姜发玉
    出席这次全国铁路劳动模范代表大会的四百六十七位代表，都是两年来人民铁道建设工作中功绩卓著的模范。他们之中许多人发挥了高度的创造精神，有许多人认真地学习了苏联先进经验，有许多人则团结了工人群众，所以他们都使生产大为提高，工作非常出色。
    济南铁路工厂翻砂工人张怀玉就是工人发挥创造性，改进工具，提高生产效率的优秀代表人物。他改进了制造乙型闸瓦砂模的工具，使工作由繁到简，从而使产量比规定标准提高了约近十倍。乙型闸瓦是火车车辆制动的必要设备，这种机件因为停车时要和车轮摩擦，容易磨损，所以消耗数量很大。济南铁路工厂原定标准是每人每天生产十五箱，这已经比日伪时期的每人每天生产八箱提高了将近一倍，但还是供不应求。张怀玉心里想：“我是新民主主义青年团员呀，应该带头提高闸瓦产量！”但他并不是一下子就想到了改进生产工具。开始时，他是用提高劳动强度的办法，当日产量从十五箱一直提高到九十六箱时，劳动强度已发挥到顶点，就再不能提高了。正在这个时候，九龙岗工厂的汪长华创造了一百二十箱的更新纪录。张怀玉这才想到：
    “蛮干不行，要改良工具才能更进一步！”于是他就开始研究改进工具，并再次把产量提高到了一百零三箱。但是仍然赶不上汪长华。张怀玉又日夜苦思。他首先分析作一箱闸瓦（两块）有多少动作，有那些动作不合理应该省去。于是他计算出一共有十四个动作，并发现其中以作底砂模时，两块木型要分两次放，耗费时间，放好木型后要把砂子砸紧和把四周的砂子刮平，也很费时间。接着他就着重研究怎样把这些费时间的动作省去。经过十来天的思索和试验后。去年十二月张怀玉终于在大家的帮助下想出了把两块木型钉到一块木板上的办法。有了这块木板后，作两块闸瓦的木型只用一次放，而且不用砸砂子就紧了，四周的砂子不用刮也就平了。动作由十四个减到九个，时间就大为节省了。有一次，他一天就作了二百四十箱。现在他经常能保持每天一百六十箱的纪录，而且铸出的闸瓦没有砂眼。过去他们全组十三人生产还供不应求，而现在只三个人生产就用之不尽了。张怀玉的这个方法已经推广到唐山、长辛店、青岛、浦镇等铁路工厂，各厂都由过去每人日产二十箱提高到了一百五六十箱。
    中长铁路局人事助理局长、郭瓦廖夫工作方法的介绍者张林是积极学习苏联先进经验提高生产的典范。他是一个中国共产党培养成的工人干部，在解放战争中双目已近失明的残废者。但是他仍然刻苦努力地从苏联书报上和向苏联专家们学习苏联办铁路的先进经验。他常常想：人民铁道是社会主义性质的企业，只有努力向老大哥学习才能很快地办好，因此他把向苏联学习当成政治任务看待。虽然他的眼睛已近失明，但是他受到保尔·柯察金的鼓舞，想出了用特号放大镜来一个字一个字看书报的办法。虽然他经常在星期日整天手不释卷，却往往只能看四、五页，但是他并不灰心。苏联书报上有许多他看不懂的地方需要向苏联专家请教。去年冬天，张林出差到大连去，坐在火车上看汽笛报（苏联报纸），他突然发现上面有一篇介绍郭瓦廖夫工作方法的文章。他一看见是介绍先进经验，就用他的特号放大镜一字一字地看。虽然火车直摇幌，但是好像那张汽笛报上有一块磁石把他吸住了一样，他聚精会神地一口气看了十个钟头，直到把那篇文章看完。回到哈尔滨后，张林立即跑到苏联专家那里，请苏联专家再把郭瓦廖夫工作方法给他重讲一遍。接着他就把那篇文章翻译成中文，得到中长路局领导人员的同意，印发到各现场去。他看见文章发下去后一个月并无动静，于是他又亲自到哈尔滨铁路工厂去作报告，动员大家学习。当该厂机械分厂厂长李树森在朱世清小组试行郭瓦廖夫工作方法产生效果后，他又建议中长铁路局派李树森等人到各分局去作报告。他认为只有大家采用了这个方法，并且收到了效果，才算是真正学到了这个方法。所以他一面组织报告，一面又在报纸上写文章宣传。他写学习苏联先进经验的文章是非常困难的，不仅要把全篇内容、结构想好，而且要把每句每字都在脑子里想好，然后口述给旁人记录。然后还要仔细研究并请苏联专家校正，所以往往写一篇稿子就要失眠几个晚上。但是他得到了莫大的报酬和安慰；中长铁路局各单位都普遍地采用了这个方法，而且收到巨大效果。根据今年一至五五个月的不完全统计，中长铁路局各单位采用郭瓦廖夫工作方法后，一共发现与推广了二百几十种优良操作方法，使生产效率普遍提高。如哈尔滨铁路工厂制氧气瓶帽的产量就提高了百分之六百六十八。东北其他国营企业推行郭瓦廖夫工作方法后也收到了很大效果。
    中国人民志愿军铁道技术部队姜发玉连长是善于依靠群众，吸收和发动群众智慧，搞好工作的突出榜样。在一件工作开始以前，他经常要召开会议研究，把计划周密地订好然后才开始做。所以他们从来没有作过返工活。有一次，他们在某桥上用火车拉被炸断的钢梁，因为钢梁被桥墩卡住了，所以用了整整三个夜晚也没有拉开。于是他就召开“诸葛亮会”请大家想办法。某班长建议用夹板垫起钢梁的接头缝，再用卷扬机起。结果他们采用这个办法把钢梁拉开了。姜发玉很重视从提高群众的政治水平和技术水平上来发挥群众的智慧，以丰富自己的智慧。在朝鲜前线的紧张的战争环境中，他还时常利用空隙时间给战士们上课，讲解工程的科学知识。他又组织新老战士以师傅带徒弟的办法进行学习，还组织了“学习检查小组”进行经常的督促。所以他连里的战士们都很有办法，也因此他们的连被称为是“诸葛亮连”。姜发玉就是紧紧地依靠连里的诸葛亮们完成工作任务。有一次一座铁桥因受炸弹爆炸震动的影响，在三十公尺长的桥身上，两条钢轨带着枕木变成一张大弯弓，甩出原来位置。弯弓的里侧还在桥上，外侧却甩出桥外，顶点离同侧桥沿达一公尺多远。怎么才能把这张大弯弓搬直放回原来的位置呢！姜发玉想把钢轨拆掉重铺，但是甩出桥身凌空的一面怎么好拆呢？并且拆了重铺要耽误很多时间，中断紧急的军事运输怎么办呢？姜发玉很焦急。正在这时一个战士——老线路工人刘佩钢想出办法来了。他说：“连长，你不是给我们讲过力学原理吗？”他指着弯弓里侧的那根钢轨说：
    “在下面垫上钢夹板，再用橇棍拨，用绳子拉，这根过来，那一根和枕木就会随着过来，过来了也就直了！”姜发玉采纳了这个意见，很快就使铁桥恢复了通车。
    新中国的铁路工人，就像张怀玉、张林和姜发玉
    一样，一心一意地用尽各种办法来提高生产效率和运输效率，把人民铁路办好。他们是人民的功臣，他们受到人民的尊敬。（新华社）
