    The Yangtze Daily launched a discussion on the issue of Jin Shanhai's thought on July 31st and concluded on September 21st. During this discussion, the editorial department received 143 letters from readers. These readers, with a serious and responsible attitude, analyzed and criticized the nature, origins, and harmfulness of Jin Shanhai's erroneous thinking, and also put forward suggestions for correcting Jin Shanhai's erroneous thinking. Many readers also examined their own thinking in connection with the matter. Jin Shanhai himself also reflected on his behavior with everyone's help. This ideological discussion has great educational significance for cadres. The Yangtze Daily editorial department published a "Summary of the Discussion on Jin Shanhai's Thought" on September 21st.
    The so-called Jin Shanhai thought refers to a kind of individualism that grew among a small number of Communist Party cadres after the national revolutionary victory, characterized by seeking fame, status, and enjoyment, and being unwilling to work diligently. Party member Jin Shanhai was a staff member of the Central and Southern China School for Honored Revolutionary Soldiers. In order to pursue "higher status and more salary," he used the excuse of wanting to study at a Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School to achieve his personal goals. The leading organization did not approve this. As a result, he confronted the organization, disobeyed organizational assignments, and refused to continue working at the School for Honored Revolutionary Soldiers. Therefore, Jin Shanhai's problem is actually the problem of transforming a Communist Party member with serious petty-bourgeois individualism, and it is a problem of purifying the Party.
    The Yangtze Daily editorial department's summary pointed out: Jin Shanhai's motives and purposes for participating in the revolution were impure. He joined the Party in order to "seek an official position" and hoped to "become a company-level cadre, carry a pistol, and return to his hometown to lord it over the people." Although his individualistic thinking had been educated by the Party for a long time after he joined the Party, it had not been thoroughly transformed. It temporarily lay dormant in difficult environments, and then grew and was exposed in the victorious situation of the revolution. His past thought was only "not returning home without being a company-level cadre," but now it was "wanting to be a big cadre and get more salary." He also mistakenly divided revolutionary work into two types: promising and unpromising. When a job position met his personal goals, he worked hard (such as when he served as the secretary of the Youth League branch committee of the school), otherwise, he slacked off, became emotional, complained, and disobeyed organizational decisions (such as when the school's political department needed cadres, he firmly refused to do it). He haggled over personal gains and losses. When the organization promoted others but not him, he jealously ridiculed and said, "I don't know how to flatter, if I knew how to flatter, I would have been promoted long ago." He was arrogant, conceited, and looked down on people, regarding old cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds as "bumpkins" who "know nothing," and new cadres as "opportunists" who "infiltrated the revolutionary ranks." He refused criticism and self-criticism, and rarely accepted other people's opinions. Whoever criticized him, he would write down their names in order to seek revenge.
    As a Communist Party member, one must be determined to strive for the realization of the communist system, and in any environment, not retreat, not betray, not surrender to the enemy, and bravely persist in the struggle throughout one's life. Therefore, all Party members must put the public interests of the people, that is, the interests of the Party, above their personal interests, and the personal interests of Party members must be subordinate to the public interests of the people and the Party. Party members are the servants of the people, not the "masters" of the people. All Party members must wholeheartedly serve the people, otherwise, they cannot be Communist Party members. Obviously, Jin Shanhai had no understanding of the Party's great goals. What he constantly thought about was "getting promoted and getting rich," "bringing honor to his ancestors," "returning home in glory," and "lording it over the people." A person with strong individualistic thoughts cannot sacrifice everything and persist in the revolution to the end. Facts have proven that Jin Shanhai wavered on the battlefield and wanted to desert, and had the shameful thought of saving his own life. During the land reform, he shielded his landlord uncle and prepared to "sue" the peasants and the local people's government.
    In our Party organization, the majority of Party members unconditionally contributed everything they had to the Party and the people in the past arduous struggles, and continue to struggle for the cause of the Party and the people after the national revolutionary victory. However, there is another group of Party members who, although they also contributed to a certain extent in the past struggles, have gradually lost the position of a Communist Party member in the victorious situation. They have forgotten the ultimate goal of a Communist Party member to strive for the realization of socialism and communism in China. They often use the work they have done in the past as "capital" to demand personal fame, status, and enjoyment from the Party, and cover up these dirty personal attempts with all kinds of nice-sounding terms. Once their personal desires cannot be satisfied, they become emotional, complain, and are unwilling to work diligently. These thoughts, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said, "if not transformed, do not possess or do not fully possess the conditions of a Communist Party member." Jin Shanhai belongs to this type of person.
    The Yangtze Daily's discussion on Jin Shanhai's thought educated many Communist Party members or revolutionary cadres, requiring everyone to establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people, and at all times take the interests of the Party, that is, the interests of the people, as their own interests. When personal interests conflict with the overall interests, they should unhesitatingly abandon personal interests and submit to the overall interests, and work happily and persistently. This is the basic condition that a Party member must possess.
    Jin Shanhai's thought is a reflection of petty-bourgeois individualistic thought within the Party. This kind of thought is illegal within the Communist Party. In order to maintain the ideological unity and purity of the Party, it is absolutely necessary to thoroughly criticize Jin Shanhai-style thinking.

### 介绍长江日报关于“金山海思想”的讨论

    介绍长江日报关于“金山海思想”的讨论
    长江日报自七月三十一日起展开了关于金山海思想问题的讨论，至九月二十一日结束。在这次讨论中，编辑部共收到读者一百四十三件来信。这些读者都以严肃认真的态度，对金山海错误思想的性质、根源、危害性，作了分析和批判，同时提出了纠正金山海错误思想的意见。不少读者并联系自己的思想进行了检查。金山海本人也在大家帮助下做了反省。这次思想讨论，对干部的教育意义很大。长江日报编辑部已于九月二十一日发表了“关于金山海思想讨论的总结。”
    所谓金山海思想，就是在全国革命胜利后，少数共产党员干部中，滋长的一种闹名誉、闹地位、要享受、不安心工作的个人主义思想。党员金山海是中南荣誉军人学校的工作人员。他为了追求“更高的地位，拿更多的薪金”，藉口要进工农速成中学学习来达到个人目的。领导机关不批准。于是他就与组织对抗，不服从组织分配，不肯继续做荣誉军校的工作。因此，金山海的问题，实际上是改造有严重的小资产阶级的个人主义的共产党员的问题，是纯洁党的问题。
    长江日报编辑部的总结指出：金山海参加革命的动机和目的是不纯的，他为了“寻求一官半职”，希望“当连级干部，挂支驳壳枪，回到家乡骑在人民头上耍耍威风”才参加党的。这种个人主义思想在他入党之后虽经党长期教育，但并未能得到彻底改造。在艰苦的环境中暂时潜伏起来，在革命的胜利形势下，便滋长与暴露出来。他过去的思想只是“不当连级干部不回家”，现在却“要当个大干部，拿更多的薪金”。他并错误地把革命工作分成为有前途的和无前途的两种，当工作岗位符合他个人的目的时，他就干得起劲（如担任该校青年团分委会工作时），否则消极怠工，闹情绪，发牢骚，不服从组织决定（如正当该校政治处需要干部时，他坚决不肯干）。他斤斤计较个人的利害得失，当组织提拔别人不提拔他时，就嫉妒嘲笑说：“我不会拍，会拍早就提升了。”他骄傲自大，看不起人，把工农出身的老干部看成是“你知道个啥”的“土包子”，把新干部看成“投机分子”“混进革命阵营”。他拒绝批评和自我批评，对别人的意见很少虚心接受，谁批评他，他便记下人家的名字，以便寻机报复。
    做为一个共产党员，必须抱定为实现共产主义制度而奋斗的决心，在任何环境下不退缩、不叛变、不投敌、终身英勇地坚持斗争。因此，一切党员必须把人民群众的公共利益，即党的利益摆在个人利益之上，党员的个人利益必须服从人民的党的公共利益。党员是人民的勤务员，不是人民的“老爷”，一切党员必须全心全意为人民群众服务，否则就不能做共产党员。显然，金山海对党的这样伟大的目的是毫无认识的，他所念念不忘的是“升官发财”“光宗耀祖”“衣锦还乡”“骑在人民头上耍耍威风”。有着浓厚的个人主义思想的人，是不可能牺牲自己的一切，坚持革命到底的。事实证明：金山海在战场上曾经动摇想开小差，存在着可耻的保命思想。在土地改革中，他曾袒护地主叔父，准备“控告”农民和当地人民政府。
    在我们党的组织里，大多数党员在过去艰苦斗争中，为党为人民无条件地贡献了自己的一切，在全国革命胜利之后，继续为党的为人民的事业奋斗。但另有一部分党员，他们虽在过去的斗争中也尽了一定的力量，但在胜利形势之下，却逐渐地丧失了一个共产党员的立场。他们忘记了一个共产党员要争取在中国实现社会主义和共产主义制度的最终目的。他们往往以过去所作的一点工作为“资本”，向党闹个人名誉、地位和享受，并用种种好听的名词，掩盖着这些个人企图的肮脏东西，一旦不能满足个人的欲望时，就闹情绪、发牢骚、不安心工作。这些思想正如刘少奇同志所说：“如果不加以改造，是不具备或不完全具备一个共产党员的条件的。”金山海便是属于这一类型的人。
    长江日报关于金山海思想的讨论，教育了许多共产党员或革命干部，要求大家树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，每时每刻都要以党的也就是人民的利益为自己的利益，当个人利益与整体的利益发生矛盾时，应毫不犹豫地放弃个人利益服从整体的利益，并愉快地、坚持不懈地进行工作。这是一个党员必须具备的起码的条件。
    金山海的思想，是小资产阶级个人主义思想在党内的反映。这种思想在共产党内是不合法的。为了保持党在思想上的统一和纯洁，彻底批评金山海式的思想，是完全必要的。
