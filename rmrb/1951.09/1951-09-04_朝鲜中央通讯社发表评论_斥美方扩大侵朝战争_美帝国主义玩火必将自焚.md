Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 1st, titled "U.S. Imperialists are Playing with Dangerous Fire," denouncing the U.S. aggressors for sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations and attempting to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea. The commentary writes: The Korean armistice negotiations have been suspended for several days due to the provocative actions of U.S. imperialism. This latest suspension of negotiations is the result of U.S. imperialism's efforts to create difficulties, hinder the smooth progress of negotiations, and attempt to sabotage the outcome of the negotiations.

The commentary points out: The entire process of the negotiations shows that our side, on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, has made various concessions in order to reach an agreement. Conversely, the U.S. side has created various conspiracies and tricks to delay and sabotage the negotiations. The commentary points out: The U.S. side agreed to start armistice negotiations not because it genuinely desired peace, but because of the pressure of public opinion and the military failures of the interventionist troops. From the very first day of the negotiations, the U.S. side put forward various demands aimed at delaying the negotiations. The U.S. military command attempted to use the Kaesong negotiations as a smokescreen for its preparations to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea. As soon as the negotiations began, Ridgway and Van Fleet went to the front lines. Subsequently, the interventionist troops launched attacks in many areas of the front. According to the confessions of enemy prisoners of war, Ridgway ordered Van Fleet during the negotiations to strengthen the front, replenish troop losses, and supply the front-line troops with the weapons and ammunition needed for frequent attacks. Our side also found on a prisoner a call to arms issued to all officers and soldiers of the puppet army by the commander of the First Corps of the puppet army, namely, Baek Sun-yup, the representative of the Syngman Rhee bandit army currently participating in the Kaesong negotiations. It read: "Do not expect peaceful negotiations in Kaesong; the meeting can only benefit us in buying time to prepare new forces." The U.S. proposal to set the military demarcation line sixty kilometers north of the 38th parallel also shows that the U.S. side does not want peace, but wants to expand the aggression. Today, after the U.S. armed forces not only violated the Kaesong neutral zone, but also bombed and shelled the residence of our delegation, Ridgway not only does not want to investigate the responsibility for this action by the U.S. side, but instead wants to frame others, attempting to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the negotiations onto us.

The commentary points out that the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the peace-loving people of the world are closely watching the Kaesong negotiations, and denounces the provocative actions of the U.S. warmongers who want to maintain a tense international situation and expand the flames of war in the Far East. The commentary says: The U.S. imperialists who are playing with the fire of sin will inevitably suffer a miserable defeat. U.S. imperialism, which attempts to enslave the freedom-loving people of Asia, will, if it does not abandon its aggressive intentions, learn the lesson of playing with fire and burning itself from the people of Asia.

    斥美方扩大侵朝战争
    美帝国主义玩火必将自焚
   【新华社三日讯】朝鲜中央通讯社一日发表题为“美帝国主义者玩着危险之火”的评论，痛斥美国侵略者破坏朝鲜停战谈判，企图继续并扩大侵朝战争。评论写道：朝鲜停战谈判由于美帝国主义的挑衅行为已经中止了数天。谈判的又一次中止是美帝国主义竭力制造困难，妨害谈判顺利进展，力图破坏谈判的结果。
    评论指出：谈判的整个过程说明，我方在和平解决朝鲜问题的道路上，为达成协议，作了各种让步。相反地，美方为拖延和破坏谈判，制造了各种阴谋诡计。评论指出：美方不是因为真正愿望和平，而是因为舆论的压力和干涉者军队在军事上的失败，才同意开始举行停战谈判。从谈判的头一天起，美方就提出了力图拖延谈判的各种要求。美军统帅部企图利用开城谈判，作为它准备继续并扩大侵朝战争的烟幕。谈判刚开始，李奇微和范佛里特就到了前线。其后，干涉者的军队在战线的许多地区发动了攻击。据敌军俘虏供认：李奇微曾命令范佛里特在谈判期间加强前线，补充部队人员损失，并把进行频繁的攻击所需要的武器、弹药供给第一线部队。我方并从一个俘虏的身上，搜出了伪军第一军团军团司令官、即目前参加开城谈判的李承晚匪军代表白善烨给伪军全体官兵的号召。其中写道：“不要期待开城和平谈判，会议只能有利于我们争取时间来准备新的力量。”美方所提把军事分界线设在三八线以北六十公里的提案同时也说明了美方不要和平，而要扩大侵略。今天，在美国的武装力量不但侵犯了开城中立区，而且在炸射了我们代表团住所之后，李奇微不仅不想查究美方这种行动的责任，反而想嫁祸于人，企图把破坏谈判的责任推卸到我们身上。
    评论指出朝鲜人民、中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民，都密切地注视着开城谈判，并痛斥要保持紧张国际形势和扩大远东战火的美国战争贩子们的挑衅行为。评论说：玩弄着罪恶之火的美帝国主义者一定要遭到惨败的。企图变亚洲爱好自由的人民为奴隶的美帝国主义者，如果不放弃其侵略企图，就将从亚洲人民这里取得玩火自焚的教训。
