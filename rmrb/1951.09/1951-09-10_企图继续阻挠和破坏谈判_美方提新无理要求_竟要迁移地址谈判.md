Xinhua News Agency, September 9th—Due to irrefutable evidence of continuously violating the Kaesong neutral zone and sabotaging the armistice negotiations, the U.S. side has now proposed a new method of relocating the negotiation site, attempting to continue to obstruct and sabotage the negotiations. As early as August 25th, the New York Times absurdly advocated "moving the meeting site from Kaesong to a more neutral place." Following this, according to a United Press report from Tokyo on September 2nd: "Ridgway may propose a new location for the ceasefire negotiations." This unreasonable demand by the U.S. side has been formally put forward in Ridgway's notice to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, on the 6th. In this reply to the protest letter issued by Generals Kim and Peng on the 1st regarding the United Nations forces' aircraft intrusion into the Kaesong neutral zone for a murder bombing, Ridgway once again demonstrated an extremely unreasonable attitude. He did not respond to the request made by Generals Kim and Peng for a serious and responsible handling of the provocative acts by the United Nations forces in repeatedly violating the Kaesong neutral zone, but instead put forward this new unreasonable demand to relocate the negotiation site for the armistice talks. In the notice, Ridgway completely ignored the well-known fact that the armistice negotiations had been stalled due to the U.S. side's sabotage of the Kaesong neutral zone, but said: "Continued use of the current Kaesong meeting site will inevitably lead to further interruptions of our armistice negotiations." Therefore, "I suggest that the liaison officers of both sides immediately meet on the bridge at Panmunjom to discuss the selection of a new meeting site that will allow the negotiations to continue without interruption." In order to achieve this absurd proposition put forward by Ridgway, the U.S. side has fabricated rumors that our side has long had armed forces in the Kaesong neutral zone. An Associated Press dispatch from the western Korean front on the 8th fabricated the rumor that: "The United Nations side learned today that...after the Communists 'agreed' on July 15th to make Kaesong a truly neutral zone, most of a Chinese division remained in Kaesong." It also said that "In addition to the large number of Communist troops in the Kaesong area, there are now Communist tank units." This approach by the U.S. side is clearly an attempt to achieve its ulterior motives of continuing to obstruct and sabotage the armistice negotiations.

    企图继续阻挠和破坏谈判
    美方提新无理要求  竟要迁移地址谈判 【新华社九日讯】由于不断侵犯开城中立区、破坏停战谈判的罪证确凿，无法抵赖，美方现又提出了迁移地址进行谈判的新办法，企图借此继续阻挠和破坏谈判。早在八月二十五日，纽约时报即荒谬地主张“把会议地点从开城移到更为中立的地方”。在这以后，据合众社东京九月二日电称：“李奇微可能提出新的地点进行休战谈判。”美方这一无理要求，在李奇微六日给朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀两位将军的通知中已正式提出。李奇微在这个答复金、彭两将军一日为联合国军飞机侵入开城中立区进行谋杀轰炸向李奇微发出的抗议书的通知中，再次表现了极端蛮横无理的态度。他没有回答金、彭两将军关于联合国军屡次破坏开城中立区的挑衅行为作认真负责处理的要求，却提出了这一迁移地址进行停战谈判的新的无理要求。李奇微在通知中完全抹煞了因美方破坏开城中立区致使停战谈判陷于停顿的众所周知的事实，却说什么：“继续使用目前的开城会议地址不可避免地会使我们的停战谈判再遭中断。”因此，“我建议双方的联络官立即在板门店的桥上会晤，商讨选择一个能使谈判继续进行而不致中断的新会址的问题。”为了达到李奇微提出的这一荒谬主张，美方又制造了所谓我方在开城中立区早有武装部队的谣言。美联社八日发自朝鲜西线的一则消息造谣说：“联合国方面今天获悉，……在七月十五日共产党‘同意’使开城成为真正中立区以后，仍有一个中国师的大部分留在开城。”又说什么“在开城地区除了共方的大量部队以外，现在还有共方的坦克部队。”美方这种作法，显然企图借此达到其继续阻挠和破坏停战谈判的不可告人的目的。
