    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 30th: Washington sources believe that the U.S. government's decision to indefinitely delay the Kaesong talks to prepare for a large-scale offensive is closely related to the upcoming San Francisco conference to sign the peace treaty with Japan. U.S. government officials fear that more countries will oppose signing the treaty, because countries participating in the San Francisco conference might consider the Korean armistice talks a sign of American weakness.

    The United States is even more fearful after the Soviet Union accepted the invitation and the governments of India, Burma, and other countries announced their opposition to the U.S.-made treaty.

    The United States attempts to prevent European and Asian countries participating in the San Francisco conference from demanding that a new draft of the peace treaty with Japan be drawn up with the participation of the Soviet Union and People's China by continuing the Korean War.

    However, any such talks that could strengthen world peace are currently unacceptable to the U.S. government. Truman's vehement anti-Soviet speech in Detroit and the U.S. government's refusal to sign the Five-Power Peace Pact are proof of this.

    The main reason the U.S. government strongly opposes any peace talks and strongly opposes a peaceful resolution to the Korean War is that it fears that under public pressure, the U.S. government might be forced to relax its military buildup movement and stop preparing for war. This is contrary to the interests of the monopoly enterprises that dominate American foreign policy.

    美国害怕各国反对单独媾和
    亟图破坏朝鲜谈判扩大战争
    【新华社一日讯】电通社华盛顿八月三十日讯：华盛顿人士认为：美国政府决定无限期拖延开城会谈以准备一次大规模进攻的决定，与即将到来的签订对日和约的旧金山会议有密切关系。美国政府人士恐怕会有更多国家反对签订和约，因为参加旧金山会议的国家可能认为朝鲜停战谈判是美国孱弱的表示。
    在苏联接受了邀请，印度、缅甸等国政府宣布了反对美制和约以后，美国更加恐惧。
    美国企图以继续朝鲜战争的方法，来防止参加旧金山会议的欧洲和亚洲国家要求在苏联和人民中国的参加下拟订新的对日和约草案。
    但是，任何可以加强世界和平的这类会谈，目前不可能为美国政府所接受。杜鲁门在底特律发表激烈的反苏演说以及美国政府拒绝签订五大国和平公约两件事情可为证明。
    美国政府极力反对任何和平会谈以及极力反对和平解决朝鲜战争的主要理由是：恐怕在公众的压力下，美国政府可能被迫松弛整顿军备运动并且停止备战。而这是违反左右美国外交政策的垄断企业的利益的。
