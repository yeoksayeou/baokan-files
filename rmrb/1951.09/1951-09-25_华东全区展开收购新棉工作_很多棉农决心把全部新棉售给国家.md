    East China Region Fully Launches New Cotton Purchase
    Many Cotton Farmers Resolve to Sell All New Cotton to the State
    The East China region has fully launched its new cotton purchase work. From late August to the 15th of this month, cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas of East China have purchased more than 7.8 million jin of ginned cotton. New cotton produced in Nanhui, Taicang, and other counties in the Sunan Administrative Region has been successively transported to Shanghai.

    This year, the cotton field area in the entire East China region has expanded by 45% compared to last year, and the estimated output has increased by 47% compared to last year, approaching the pre-war production level. Currently, cotton farmers in various parts of the region are launching a patriotic collective cotton selling campaign of "pick quickly, dry quickly, sort quickly, sell quickly." Many cotton farmers and cooperative members are writing letters to Chairman Mao, reporting their plans and determination to sell all new cotton to the state. In many places in Yuyao, Xiaoshan, and Haining counties in Zhejiang Province, cotton farmers are establishing collective cotton selling organizations by village and competing with each other. They preliminarily grade and classify the cotton in advance, and then sell it to the cooperatives by village and group in turn. In some areas, cooperative cadres and staff of state-owned cotton, yarn, and fabric companies have also launched a patriotic competition of "collect quickly, gin quickly, pack quickly, transport quickly." This not only saves cotton farmers a lot of labor, but also greatly improves the efficiency of cooperative purchases. The Huashan District Cooperative cotton collection station in Xiaoshan County, due to collective sales by members, only takes an average of three minutes for each cotton farmer to sell cotton, from inspection and weighing to payment.

    The supply of materials to farmers in the cotton-producing areas of East China has been greatly strengthened. For example, state-owned trading companies in the Yancheng and Huaiyin areas of northern Jiangsu have formed joint material supply stations in the cotton-producing areas, implementing direct transportation to facilitate cooperatives to replenish various goods at any time and supply farmers.

    华东全区展开收购新棉工作
    很多棉农决心把全部新棉售给国家
    华东区收购新棉工作全面展开。华东产棉区合作社从八月下旬到本月十五日的半个多月中，已收购皮棉七百八十多万斤。苏南行署区南汇、太仓等县所产新棉已陆续运到上海。
    今年华东全区棉田面积较去年扩大百分之四十五，估计产量比去年增加百分之四十七，接近于抗战前的生产水平。目前全区各地棉农正在展开“快摘、快晒、快拣、快卖”的爱国主义集体售棉运动，很多棉农和合作社社员写信给毛主席，报告将全部新棉售给国家的计划和决心。浙江省余姚、萧山、海宁等县许多地方棉农以村为单位建立集体售棉组织，互相比赛。他们事先将棉花初步评级分类，然后分村分组依次出售给合作社。有些地区合作社干部与国营花纱布公司收花人员也进行了“快收、快轧、快打包、快运”的爱国主义竞赛。这样不但节省了棉农大量人工，而且使合作社收购效率大大提高。萧山县龛山区合作社收花站，由于社员集体送售，平均每个棉农售棉时从检验、过秤到交付货款，只需三分钟。
    华东产棉区农民的物资供应工作已大为加强，如苏北盐城、淮阴专区各国营贸易公司分别组成产棉区的联合物资供应站，实行直线运输，便于合作社随时补进各项货品，供应农民。（新华社）
