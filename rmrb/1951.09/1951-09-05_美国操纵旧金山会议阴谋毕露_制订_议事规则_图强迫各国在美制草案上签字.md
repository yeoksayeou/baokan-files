    U.S. Conspiracy to Manipulate San Francisco Conference Fully Exposed
    Formulating "Rules of Procedure" to Force Countries to Sign U.S.-Made Draft
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] The U.S.'s arrogant attitude in attempting to manipulate the San Francisco conference and force countries to sign and endorse the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan is becoming increasingly absurd. On the 1st, the U.S. State Department published a booklet entitled "Background of the Peace Conference with Japan." It openly stated: The San Francisco conference is merely "a signing conference, not a negotiating conference... The main business in San Francisco will be signing the treaty (referring to the U.S.-made draft peace treaty with Japan) that everyone agrees on."
    At the same time, the U.S. is colluding with its main puppet states to formulate unreasonable "rules of procedure" in order to prevent the Soviet Union and representatives from countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia from proposing fair peace treaty proposals at the conference, and to suppress objections from other countries' representatives to the U.S.-made draft. According to a United Press San Francisco dispatch, "diplomatic circles" said on August 30th: "Representatives of the United States and major allies have reached an agreement on general rules of procedure." The so-called "rules of procedure" will stipulate that "each country's speaking time will be limited, and no prolonged debate will be allowed unless they are prepared to leave." Prior to this, the Wall Street's main mouthpiece, "The New York Times," revealed on August 24th that the United States had formulated a set of "strict" rules for the San Francisco conference. According to the rules, "amendments to the (U.S.-made) treaty are prohibited," and the rules of procedure "allocate one hour to each delegation to express formal opinions on the treaty, and after that, no further debate can be made until all other delegations have spoken." The "New York Times" admitted that these rules are intended to force the countries participating in the conference to sign and endorse the U.S.-made draft, "implementing the U.S.'s opinions."

    美国操纵旧金山会议阴谋毕露
    制订“议事规则”图强迫各国在美制草案上签字
    【新华社四日讯】美国力图操纵旧金山会议，强迫各国在美英对日和约草案上签字画押的专横态度，愈来愈荒唐。一日，美国国务院发表题为“对日和会背景”的小册子。它公开地说：旧金山会议只是“签字的会议，不是谈判的会议……在旧金山的主要事务将是在大家同意的和约（按指美制对日和约草案）上签字。”
    同时，美国正勾结它的主要仆从国家，制订无理的“议事规则”，以便阻挠苏联以及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国代表在会议上提出公正的对日和约的建议，并压制其他国家代表对美制草案提出反对的意见。据合众社旧金山消息透露，“外交界人士”八月三十日说：“美国与各主要盟国的代表们对于一般议事规则已经获致协议”，所谓“议事规则”将规定“每一国家的发言时间都有一定限制，不准延长辩论，除非他们准备走开。”在此以前，华尔街的主要喉舌“纽约时报”在八月二十四日曾经透露，美国已经为旧金山会议制订了一套“严格的”规则。根据该规则，“禁止对（美制）和约提出修正案”，议事规则“分配给每一代表团对和约发表正式意见的时间是一小时，此后，要等到一切其他代表团都发了言之后，才能再作辩论”。“纽约时报”承认：这些规则是为了强迫参加会议的国家在美制草案上签字画押，“实行美国的意见”。
