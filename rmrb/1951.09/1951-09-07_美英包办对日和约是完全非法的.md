The United States, in order to openly and on a large scale rearm Japan and continue and expand its war of aggression in Asia, has intensified its efforts to independently conclude a peace treaty with Japan since its defeat in the war of aggression against Korea. In this sinister act, the United States has received the support of the British government. On August 13th of this year, the U.S. and British governments announced the final version of their unilaterally formulated draft peace treaty with Japan, which seriously infringes upon the sovereignty and interests of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries. On the 4th of this month, they convened an illegal peace conference with Japan in San Francisco, openly excluding the People's Republic of China. This action by the U.S. and British governments to monopolize and control the peace treaty with Japan is absurd and completely illegal, and it is absolutely unacceptable to the people of China, the Soviet Union, other Asian countries, and all peace-loving people around the world.

The peace treaty with Japan is the inevitable result of the victory in the war against Japan, and the victory in the war against Japan was mainly achieved by China and the Soviet Union and the people of Asia through long and heroic struggles, paying incalculable sacrifices and costs. Although the United States and Britain were forced to go to war against Japan after the Pearl Harbor incident in December 1941, they were not active throughout, and therefore contributed relatively little to the victory in the war against Japan. Not only that, but historical facts also record that the countries that suffered long-term harm and threats from Japanese aggressors in the past were mainly China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries, while the United States and Britain once helped Japan's aggression. Therefore, no matter from which aspect, the peace treaty with Japan must be jointly prepared, drafted, and signed by all countries that participated in the war against Japan with troops, including China and the Soviet Union, and should never be monopolized by the U.S. and British governments alone.

The following historical facts are sufficient to prove our assertion.

	I. China's Contribution to the War Against Japan

The Chinese people have suffered miserably from imperialist aggression in the past century. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japanese imperialism became the most important threat to the Chinese people, and this situation continued until Japan's surrender in August 1945. The Chinese people have suffered from Japanese aggression for such a long time in the past, and defeated the Japanese aggressors with huge sacrifices in a difficult and protracted war. Naturally, they have the greatest say in the peace treaty with Japan. If the United States insists on illegally剥奪ing the Chinese people's right to speak on this issue that is most closely related to their interests, it powerfully proves that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people after Japan's surrender.

	(1) The Existence of Japanese Imperialism Was the Root Cause of China's Disasters

Just by looking back at the historical relationship between China and Japan in the past seventy years, people will realize that the Chinese people absolutely cannot allow Japan to become an aggressive country again. From the bloody historical lessons that the Chinese people have learned from the relationship between China and Japan over the past seventy years, we know that any aggressive and adventurous action by Japan will inevitably harm China first.

Since the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the aggressive and adventurous policy of Japan's reactionary ruling group has consistently targeted China as its primary goal. On July 20, 1927, the then Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi publicly announced in a memorial to the Emperor: "If you want to conquer the world, you must first conquer China," and said: "This is the legacy of Emperor Meiji, and it is also a necessary condition for the existence of our Japanese Empire." Marshall, in his two-year (1943-1945) report as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, also considered this arrogant so-called "Tanaka Memorial" to be "the blueprint for Japanese policy."

The "Tanaka Memorial" said: "...Stealing the legacy of Emperor Meiji, the first stage is to conquer Taiwan, and the second stage is to conquer Korea," and "the third stage is to destroy Manchuria and Mongolia," which is a prerequisite for "conquering China." For more than seventy years, Japanese imperialism has implemented aggression against China in accordance with this "legacy of Emperor Meiji." Japan's aggression against China has intensified step by step, and the suffering of the Chinese people has deepened accordingly. In 1894, Japan launched the Sino-Japanese War,夺去ing Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from China; in 1905, after Japan defeated Tsarist Russia, it seized the lease of Lushun and Dalian in China and划ing the northeast of China as its sphere of aggression; in 1914, Japan took advantage of its participation in the Allied Powers in the First World War to seize the aggressive privileges of German imperialism in Shandong; in 1915, Japan put forward the Twenty-One Demands to China, which would have destroyed China; on September 18, 1931, Japan launched a war of aggression against Northeast China and occupied the four northeastern provinces of China; on January 28, 1932, Japan launched a war of aggression in Shanghai; in 1935, Japan invaded North China, established the puppet "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Government," and signed the "He-Umezu Agreement" with the Kuomintang traitorous government, which infringed upon China's territorial sovereignty; on July 7, 1937, Japan launched a full-scale war of aggression against China, until it was thoroughly defeated in August 1945. This series of historical facts shows the special relationship between the Chinese people and the Japanese issue, that is: if Japan's aggressive forces are not completely eliminated, China's security will not be guaranteed for a day, and the Chinese people will not be able to live a peaceful and stable life.

	(2) The Chinese People's Protracted Resistance Fundamentally Shook Japan's Aggression Plan

The Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan began with the "September 18th Incident" in 1931. The official U.S. historical document—President Roosevelt's message to the U.S. Congress on December 15, 1941, declaring war on Japan, also stated: "Japan's aggression began in Manchuria in 1931." Since then, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have waged a resolute resistance against the Japanese aggressors. Although there have been many difficulties and twists and turns, the Chinese people's resistance to Japanese aggression has not been interrupted, and they launched a full-scale war of resistance on July 7, 1937, and persisted until the final victory.

The Chinese people not only launched the earliest and persisted the longest in the war against Japan, but also resisted all of Japan's aggressive forces independently in the arduous battles for more than ten years before December 7, 1941. During that long period, the U.S. and British governments tried to sacrifice China to compromise with Japan, and constantly sold a large amount of war materials to Japan, strengthening Japan's aggressive forces against the Chinese people, thereby increasing the difficulty of the Chinese people's resistance to Japanese aggression.

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to the long-term accumulation of strength by the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan, they were able to launch a local counter-offensive against the enemy in the enemy's rear battlefield between 1943 and 1944. According to incomplete statistics in 1944, in that year, the Chinese people fought more than 20,000 battles against the enemy in the enemy's rear battlefield, killing and wounding more than 220,000 enemy and puppet troops, capturing more than 60,000 enemy and puppet troops, defecting 30,000 puppet troops, recovering 18 county towns, attacking 47 county towns, recovering more than 80,000 square kilometers of land, and liberating 12 million compatriots. The Chinese people's attacks and blows against the Japanese invaders during this period greatly reduced the burden of the U.S. and Britain in the Pacific.

The Chinese people's protracted resistance has long consumed and damaged the Japanese invaders' aggressive forces. According to statistics released by the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, the Chinese enemy's rear battlefield (excluding the Northeast) wiped out more than 527,000 Japanese troops during the eight-year War of Resistance, including more than 520,000 killed and wounded, and nearly 7,000 captured and surrendered; if the casualties, captures, and defections of puppet troops are included, the loss of enemy and puppet troops in the seven and a half years from September 1937 to March 1945 reached more than 1.36 million. As for the financial and material resources paid by the Japanese invaders to continue the war of aggression in the Chinese people's protracted war of resistance, they were also very huge. The Japanese invaders' military budget for the war against China was 2.5 billion yen in 1937, 4.85 billion yen in 1938, 4.605 billion yen in 1939, 5.46 billion yen in 1940, and 11.48 billion yen in 1941; in 1942, it increased to 18 billion yen. The consumption of such huge, year-long military expenses caused serious difficulties in Japan's wartime economy. In addition, in order to achieve the goal of "supporting the war with war," the Japanese invaders invested heavily in the so-called "development" plan after occupying most of Northeast, North, and Central China. The five-year "construction" plan in the puppet Manchukuo cost 1.5 billion yen per year, and the four-year "development" plan in North and Central China cost 2 billion yen per year. However, these so-called "development" plans of the Japanese invaders were severely damaged due to the continuous attacks of the Chinese liberated areas on the enemy-occupied areas. The U.S. Information Service's book "War Against Japan" also stated: China "Guerrillas operate behind enemy lines, they can contain the enemy and prevent the enemy from gaining complete political consolidation and economic development in the conquered areas." This made the Japanese invaders' plan to "support the war with war" completely crushed.

The Japanese invaders originally hoped to achieve "quick victory and quick settlement," "using Chinese to control Chinese," and "supporting the war with war" in China, making China its "supply base for the Greater East Asia War." However, what they gained in the war of aggression against China was such huge and endless consumption and losses in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, which inevitably fundamentally shook their overall aggressive plan.

	(3) China Was the Main Battlefield in the War Against Japan

All historical facts of the war against Japan prove that China was the main battlefield against Japan from beginning to end; the blows that the Chinese people gave to the Japanese aggressors in long, repeated, and arduous battles were the most important condition for achieving victory in the war against Japan.

After Japan launched a full-scale offensive against China in July 1937, it consistently deployed the most troops on the Chinese battlefield in the past years of fighting and was constantly forced to increase them. After the war began in 1937, Japan's troops in China reached about 500,000, increasing to 680,000 in 1938, and 860,000 in 1939 (the above figures do not include the Northeast). By June 1941, in order to cooperate with the Hitler bandits and prepare to launch an offensive against the eastern border of the Soviet Union at any time, Japan greatly increased its troops to Northeast China, making its total number of troops in China reach more than 1.7 million that winter. Among them, more than 600,000 fought in the Chinese mainland, and another 400,000 engaged in the cruel war of "suppression" against the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. After December 7, 1941, although Japan started a war with the U.S. and Britain in the Pacific, it did not reduce its troops in China, but increased them from time to time. As of August 1945, Japan's total combat troops outside the mainland were more than 3.2 million for the army and more than 400,000 for the navy, of which the army in the Chinese region (including the Northeast and Taiwan) was 2,073,000 and the navy was 102,000; if the troops in the Northeast and Taiwan are excluded, there were also 1,173,000 army and 35,000 navy on the Chinese mainland battlefield; in addition, there were 254,000 army and 67,000 navy in Korea; and the troops fighting the U.S. and Britain on the Pacific islands were very limited in number. Is this not enough to prove that China was the main battlefield in the war against Japan; the Chinese people shouldered the main responsibility in the war against Japan?

On the Chinese battlefield, the main responsibility for fighting against Japan was undertaken by the Chinese people's army and the local armed forces in the liberated areas led by the Communist Party of China. The Chinese people's army, with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army as the main force, entered the enemy's rear from the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, launched a counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders, recovered many places in North and Central China, and posed a serious threat to the Japanese invaders' offensive. Due to the great development of the guerrilla war behind enemy lines, after the Japanese invaders occupied Wuhan and Guangzhou in October 1938, a strategic stalemate appeared on the Chinese battlefield, and the Japanese invaders could no longer advance. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government adopted the reactionary policy of passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism; the Japanese invaders stopped the strategic offensive on the frontal battlefield, implemented political inducement to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, and put the main pressure on the enemy's rear battlefield to attack the Chinese people's army that was conducting guerrilla warfare in their rear. Therefore, the enemy's rear battlefield resisted most of the forces of the Japanese invaders and puppet troops, becoming the main front of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the process of the War of Resistance after October 1938, the enemy's rear battlefield always resisted about 60% or so, up to 75% of the invading Japanese army and more than 90% of the puppet troops; if the Japanese and puppet troops are combined, the enemy's rear battlefield always resisted more than 80% of the enemy and puppet forces. This fact can even be seen from the official materials of the Japanese invaders at that time. For example, the comprehensive report of the North China Dispatch Army Headquarters of the Japanese invaders in 1943 stated: "Most of the enemies are the CCP army, which is the opposite of the Chiang army. In 15,000 battles in half a year, the CCP fought in 75% of them. In the 2 million enemy troops in the battles, more than half are CCP troops." Therefore, China's great contribution and glorious achievements in the war against Japan mainly belong to the Chinese people led by the Communist Party of China.

China's War of Resistance Against Japan was a true people's war. Under the correct leadership of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people overcame the crisis of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary faction's surrender and compromise with Japan in the War of Resistance Against Japan, consolidated and expanded the anti-Japanese national united front, developed their own armed forces, and thus continuously achieved brilliant victories. In the eight years of the full-scale War of Resistance, the Chinese people's armed forces expanded and strengthened year by year. Among them, the main forces, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, had only 92,000 people in 1937, but by 1940, they had become a powerful force of 500,000 people. By August 1945, the number had more than doubled, totaling 1,297,000. At the same time, there were more than 20,000 troops in the South China Anti-Japanese Column, which was established and developed in 1938, totaling 1,318,000. In addition to the main forces, the liberated areas also mobilized and organized local guerrillas and people's armed forces (militia and people's self-defense forces) to rely on and cooperate with the main forces to conduct extensive guerrilla warfare against the enemy. According to statistics in 1944, the militia in the liberated areas of China was more than 1,685,000, and it increased by more than 1 million to more than 2,687,000 in August 1945; as for the people's self-defense forces, according to statistics in March 1945, there were more than 10 million people. Such a powerful people's armed force attacked and besieged the enemy everywhere on the vast enemy's rear battlefield, making the enemy fall into the vast ocean of the people's war, where they could be destroyed at any time, and could not extricate themselves. The Japanese invaders could not but acknowledge the unparalleled power of this people's war in their serious defeat. The "Shinpei," the organ of the General Headquarters of the North China Dispatch Army of the Japanese invaders, once said in an editorial published in September 1943: "The characteristics of the CCP are various, and the most essential characteristic is their people's armed forces. If the characteristics of modern warfare are the total national power war, then the characteristics of the CCP's combat are the most thorough modern warfare."

Because the Chinese people realized Mao Zedong's brilliant strategic policy of the people's war, after eight years of hard fighting, they recovered most of the land occupied by the Kuomintang reactionary government behind enemy lines (the Kuomintang lost more than 1.44 million square kilometers of land during the War of Resistance), established and consolidated 19 large liberated areas with an area of 956,000 square kilometers (including the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region), liberating nearly 100 million of the 260 million people in the occupied areas. What is particularly important is that these liberated areas are all the most important strategic areas in the country. All the important cities in the country occupied by the Japanese invaders, such as Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, Taiyuan, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Wuhan, Anqing, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, etc., were all surrounded by our army; all the thousands of miles of coastline and important ports in the country were within our army's control and range of activities. This situation made it impossible for the Japanese invaders to solve the war, no matter how many troops they continued to deploy on the Chinese battlefield, but instead they became more and more deeply involved.

Since the Japanese invaders regarded China as the main battlefield of their war of aggression, and "conquering China" as the primary and prerequisite condition for their "conquering the world," their continuous defeats on the Chinese battlefield inevitably became the most important and serious reason for their final and complete collapse.

	(4) The Chinese People's Huge Sacrifices in the War of Resistance

The great contributions and glorious victories of the Chinese people in the war against Japan were exchanged for heroic fighting and bloodshed. The huge sacrifices and costs paid by the Chinese people in the war against Japan to win their own national independence and survival and to ensure peace and security in Asia and the world cannot be compared with those of the U.S., Britain, and other countries.

In the eight years of arduous war, according to incomplete statistics in March 1945, the number of Chinese people's soldiers who bled and sacrificed to fight the enemy and defend the motherland reached more than 446,700 for the main forces alone; the sacrifice figures of the militia and people's self-defense forces who were awe-inspiring, would rather die than surrender, and fought the brutal enemy to the last minute are not included.

The Japanese aggressors were extremely barbaric enemies. They adopted inhuman large-scale massacres and destruction against the Chinese people's heroic resistance, attempting to make the Chinese people submit in the face of brutal methods. After the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan entered a strategic stalemate in October 1938, the Japanese invaders carried out long-term, repeated, and cruel "sweeps" against the Chinese enemy's rear battlefield. Each "sweep" used superior forces; their "sweep" methods included the so-called "iron wall encirclement, capture and surprise attack, vertical and horizontal sweeps, reverse electric shock, and repeated selection." Wherever the Japanese invaders went during the "sweep," they systematically implemented the "three alls policy" of burning all, killing all, and robbing all, and created "no-man's land" hundreds of kilometers long and tens of kilometers wide on the border of the puppet Manchukuo and Wutai Mountain in Shanxi, attempting to eliminate the living conditions of the Chinese people's army. Moreover, in order to "block," "divide," and "nibble" the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, the Japanese invaders demolished large numbers of people's houses and farmlands, forced the people to build bunkers and trenches, making the people's lives extremely painful.

The Japanese invaders' inhumane war in the enemy's rear caused the Chinese people in the enemy's rear to suffer unparalleled deaths and property losses. According to incomplete statistics published by the Yan'an Liberation Daily on January 14, 1946, and thereafter, in the eight-year War of Resistance, the number of people massacred by the Japanese invaders in the eight liberated areas of Jin-Sui, Jin-Cha-Ji, Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji-Re-Liao, Taihang, Shandong, Huaihai, and Su-Wan alone reached 3,040,172, the number of able-bodied men captured reached more than 3,398,000, the number of houses burned down totaled more than 17,837,800, the number of livestock lost (excluding the Taihang area) was more than 15,867,100, the number of grains lost (excluding the Taihang area) was more than 617,110,000 shi, the number of agricultural tools lost (excluding the Taihang and Ji-Lu-Yu areas) was more than 45,515,900, and the number of clothing lost (excluding the Taihang and Ji-Lu-Yu areas) was more than 82,834,800.

In addition, the Japanese invaders carried out crazy massacres and looting everywhere in the occupied areas they controlled and conquered, and barbarously bombed and destroyed Chinese cities ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government. In all the major Chinese cities occupied by the Japanese invaders, they wantonly burned, killed, raped, and plundered, committing shocking bloody crimes. Among them, the Nanjing Massacre committed by the Japanese invaders aroused the anger of the people of the world. According to the indictment of Matsui Iwane, commander of the Japanese expeditionary army that captured Nanjing, by Australian prosecutor Mullen of the Far East International Tribunal: "After the fall of Nanjing, the Japanese killed Chinese civilians by cruel means in six weeks, totaling 260,000 to 300,000. The Japanese army raped Chinese women 20,000 times, including those as young as nine and as old as seventy-three." In other major cities, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of Chinese people were killed by the Japanese invaders. These blood debts are also unforgettable to the Chinese people.

As for the Japanese invaders' destruction of Chinese industry, it was also unprecedented. According to the investigation of the Economic Department of the former Kuomintang reactionary government, after the "August 13th" incident, 2,375 factories were destroyed in Shanghai; outside Shanghai, the number of factories destroyed registered with the Economic Department of the Kuomintang reactionary government alone reached 1,465, totaling 3,840. This was a serious damage to the already small number of industries in China.

In addition, the huge number of Chinese people who died due to the crimes of the Japanese invaders experimenting with and using bacteriological weapons and using poison gas in China cannot be calculated.

In short, the Japanese aggressors brought unprecedented disasters to the Chinese people in the war of aggression against China, like a hateful plague. According to incomplete statistics, more than 10 million Chinese people died due to the war in the eight-year War of Resistance. During the same period, the loss of Chinese public property and war expenses was worth about 30 billion U.S. dollars, and the loss of private property was worth about 20 billion U.S. dollars, totaling 50 billion U.S. dollars.

All these facts show that the Chinese people suffered huge sacrifices and made great contributions in the war against Japan, and show that the Chinese people were one of the most important forces in defeating Japanese imperialism. This role and status of the Chinese people in the war against Japan can never be erased or ignored by anyone.

	II. The Soviet Union's Contribution to the War Against Japan

U.S. imperialism is attempting to deny the decisive role played by the Soviet Union in the war that finally defeated Japan, but as Marshal Stalin said in his "Message to the People" issued on September 2, 1945, for the victory in the war against Japan: "For the sake of victory, we, the Soviet people, have spared no effort and labor." Since the "September 18th Incident," the Soviet Union has consistently打击ing Japan's aggression. After July 7, 1937, it used its political, economic, and military power to assist the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan. On August 9, 1945, it participated in the war against Japan with troops, destroying the Japanese aggressors' elite Kwantung Army, enabling the Allied countries to achieve the final victory in the war against Japan. The Soviet Union made immortal contributions in the war against Japan.

	(1) Japanese Imperialism Has Consistently Been Hostile to the Soviet Union

Japanese imperialism has consistently been hostile to the Soviet Union, playing the role of anti-Soviet gendarme in the East in the imperialist camp, and using this to win the concessions of the U.S. and Britain to its policies of aggression against China and Asia. Japan's aggressive policy was to realize its dream of dominating Asia first and then dominating the world in the adventure of actively opposing the Soviet Union on the one hand and actively attacking the people of Asia on the other.

The "Tanaka Memorial," which Marshall called "the blueprint for Japanese policy," contained a passage that read: "The fate of the Japanese Empire is destined to clash with Russia. In order to control Manchuria, it may be necessary to deal with Russia on the Mongolian grassland; the Empire should station heavy troops in northern Manchuria, and Russia will naturally not take it lightly and will inevitably send troops to interfere, so we can find a formal excuse to start a war." Since the success of the October Revolution in Russia, Japan has been looking for and creating excuses to attack the Soviet Union in order to侵夺 the Soviet Union's Far East territory.

In 1918, shortly after the Soviet Union established a socialist state, Japan organized the imperialist armed intervention against the Soviet Union in the East, occupying Soviet Far East territory for four years; in July 1938, Japan launched an offensive against the Soviet Union's Lake Khasan area from Northeast China. After being subjected to a powerful counter-offensive and heavy casualties by the Soviet army, it was forced to cease the fire; in May 1939, Japan launched another offensive against the Khalkhin Gol area in the People's Republic of Mongolia from the Northeast, attempting to break into the Soviet Outer Baikal region and cut off the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Soviet army and Mongolian army fought side by side, repelling the Japanese invading army. After four months of fierce fighting, the Japanese invading troops were completely surrounded and annihilated. The two battles of Lake Khasan and Khalkhin Gol severely taught the Japanese aggressors a lesson, making them afraid to easily invade the Soviet Union for a long time.

	(2) Actively Assist China's War of Resistance, Contain a Large Number of Japanese Troops

Based on its firm peaceful diplomatic policy, the Soviet Union has consistently actively assisted countries that have been invaded. Stalin said at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on March 10, 1939: "We are peaceful, friendly, and good-neighborly relations with all countries bordering the Soviet Union... We assist nations that have been invaded and are fighting for their national independence."

Since the "September 18th Incident," the Soviet Union has always stood firmly on the side of the Chinese people, supporting the Chinese people's anti-Japanese struggle. In 1932, when the "January 28th Incident" broke out, the Soviet Union more actively suggested resuming the Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations that had been interrupted due to the hostile policy of the Kuomintang reactionary government; Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov officially stated on December 12 of the same year, the day Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations were restored: "The Soviet Union morally, spiritually, and emotionally completely sympathizes with China and is willing to provide all necessary assistance."

In September 1934, after the Soviet Union was invited to join the League of Nations, Litvinov, on behalf of the Soviet government, formally condemned Japan as an aggressor state at the conference. In those long and dark days when Japanese aggressors were trampling on the sacred territory of Northeast and North China, the Soviet Union was the only one in the international community to issue such a just voice, spiritually encouraging the Chinese people's resistance to the Japanese aggressors.

After the outbreak of the July 7th War of Resistance, the Soviet Union was the earliest and most active in assisting China. On August 21, 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression treaty, and on June 16, 1939, they signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. This treaty was the first truly equal and mutually beneficial commercial treaty signed by China and foreign countries in nearly a century. At the same time, from 1937 to 1940, the Soviet Union repeatedly loaned China huge sums of money, totaling 306,385,800 U.S. dollars, and converted these loans into munitions, which were continuously supplied to China. The aircraft, tanks, and many other weapons in the early stage of China's War of Resistance came from this source. In addition, the Soviet Union sent many military experts to help China, and the Soviet people organized a volunteer air force to participate in the war in China, fighting side by side with the Chinese people to打击 the Japanese aggressors. More than 100 Soviet volunteer air force warriors, including heavy bomber squadron leader Kurishenko and fighter squadron leader Rakhmanov, sacrificed their precious lives in combat for the cause of the Chinese people's War of Resistance. This precious friendship will never be forgotten by the Chinese people.

This political, military, and financial assistance from the Soviet Union played an extremely important role in the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan. China's financial and material resources were quite difficult at the beginning of the War of Resistance, so the Soviet Union's assistance to China at that time greatly strengthened the Chinese people's resistance forces.

During this period when the Soviet Union actively assisted China in the War of Resistance (1937-1940), China was fighting against Japan alone; therefore, this assistance was also an important contribution of the Soviet Union in the war against Japan during that period.

After the Soviet Union entered the Great Patriotic War on June 22, 1941, to resist the treacherous offensive of the Hitler bandits, the Soviet Union never slackened its vigilance against Japanese imperialism. The Soviet Union maintained a strong force of 40 divisions on its eastern border throughout the four years from 1941 to 1945, containing the entire strength of the Japanese elite Kwantung Army. This means that although the Soviet Union did not participate in the war against Japan at that time, the Soviet Union greatly facilitated the war against Japan by China, the U.S., and Britain because it contained a large number of Japanese troops.

The Japanese aggressors actively prepared for an offensive against the Soviet Union. In the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Plan" formulated by the Japanese National Policy Research Association in 1941, there was a chapter entitled "The Future of Soviet Territory," which stipulated that Germany and Japan would jointly divide the Soviet Union, and stipulated that the border between Germany and Japan would be demarcated by Omsk. After Hitler Germany began its offensive against the Soviet Union, Japan gathered troops in Northeast China, preparing to wait for a favorable opportunity to realize its dream of joining forces with the Hitler bandits in Omsk.

In June 1941, the Japanese Kwantung Army in the Northeast totaled 480,000 people, but by September 1 of the same year, it had increased to 1 million people, and was equipped with 5,000 artillery pieces, 1,000 tanks, and 1,000 aircraft. If the troops concentrated in Korea, Inner Mongolia, and Southern Sakhalin Island are added, then the number of troops that Japan prepared to use to deal with the Soviet Union at this time would account for half of its total ground forces (the total number of the Japanese army at that time was 2.1 million). In August 1942, after the Hitler bandits launched the Battle of Stalingrad, the Japanese invaders once again strengthened their forces in the Northeast, reaching 1.1 million people (the total number of the Japanese army at that time was 2.4 million); and they also established two staff headquarters: one was the Northern Line Staff Headquarters in Qiqihar, and the other was the Eastern Line Staff Headquarters in Mudanjiang.

The above facts clearly show that Japan had waited for the fall of Moscow or Stalingrad, but the favorable opportunity waited for by the Japanese aggressors did not occur. The Hitler bandits retreated in Moscow and then suffered a tragic defeat in Stalingrad. However, the Japanese aggressors did not completely abandon their criminal plan to attack the Soviet Union because of this. Until 1945, they still maintained nearly 1 million troops in the Northeast and Korea.

From 1941 to 1945, the Soviet Union contained the entire strength of the Japanese elite Kwantung Army during the most difficult period of the Great Patriotic War, making an important contribution to the war against Japan. This is an important and undeniable fact.

	(3) The Soviet Union's Participation in the War Against Japan Led to Japan's Defeat and Surrender

On February 11, 1945, when the Soviet Union was still fully engaged in the war against Germany, it agreed at the Yalta Conference held by the leaders of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan after defeating Hitler Germany. The Yalta Agreement stipulated: "The leaders of the three great powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain agree that the Soviet Union will participate in the Allied side in the war against Japan within two or three months after Germany's surrender and the end of the European war."

On May 8, 1945, the Soviet Union achieved complete victory in the war against Germany, putting the Japanese aggressors in a state of isolation and despair worldwide. The Japanese fascist government also began to feel this situation. On the one hand, they decided at the "Imperial Conference" on June 9, 1945, to prepare for a "decisive battle" to "maintain the national polity and defend the imperial land," and on the other hand, they requested the Soviet Union to mediate for peace in the Far East, engaging in diplomatic deception to delay time and avoid surrender. The Soviet Union, faithful to its obligations to the Allies, rejected Japan's request and declared war on Japan on August 9, 1945. On August 10, the People's Republic of Mongolia also declared war on Japan and participated in the war against Japan alongside the Soviet army.

Starting from August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union, with its powerful army, air force, and Pacific Fleet, participated in the war against Japan and launched a fierce offensive against the Japanese Kwantung Army in the Northeast. The Soviet Red Army, with the force of thunder, broke through the Japanese army's defenses and destroyed the Japanese army's resistance. In the 1

    美英包办对日和约是完全非法的
    高集
    美国为了要公开地大规模地重新武装日本，以便继续和扩大在亚洲的侵略战争，自从侵朝战争遭受挫败以来，即加紧单独对日媾和的活动。在这一罪恶行为上，美国得到了英国政府的支持。美英政府在本年八月十三日公布了它们片面制订的严重侵害中苏两国及亚洲其他国家的主权与利益的所谓对日和约草案定本，本月四日已在旧金山召开了公然将中华人民共和国排斥在外的非法的对日和会。美英政府这种包办把持对日和约的行动是荒谬绝伦的，完全非法的，是中国、苏联和亚洲其他国家人民及全世界一切爱好和平的人民绝对不能承认的。
    对日和约是对日战争胜利的必然的结果，而对日战争的胜利主要是由于中苏两国和亚洲人民经过长期英勇的斗争，付出难以计算的牺牲与代价而取得的。美英两国虽于一九四一年十二月珍珠港事件后被迫对日作战，但始终是不积极的，因而对于取得对日战争的胜利，贡献是比较小的。不仅如此，历史的事实也同时记载着：过去受日本侵略者长期侵害和威胁的也主要是中苏和亚洲其他国家，美英两国却曾经助长日本的侵略，所以不论从那一方面说，对日和约都必须由包括中苏在内的所有曾以军队参加对日作战的国家来共同准备、拟制和签订，而决不应由美英两国政府来单独包办。
    下面所叙述的历史事实就足以证明我们的这个论断。
        一、中国在对日战争中的贡献
    中国人民在过去一百年来惨遭帝国主义的侵略，在一八九四年中日战争以后，日本帝国主义成为中国人民最主要的威胁，这种情势一直继续到一九四五年八月日本投降为止。中国人民在过去如此长期地遭受着日本的侵害，并在艰苦而持久的战争中以巨大牺牲击败了日本侵略者，自然就在对日和约上有着最大的发言权。如果在这个与中国人民利害关系最大的问题上，美国一定要非法剥削中国人民的发言权，那就十分有力地证明：美帝国主义是中国人民在日本投降后最凶恶的敌人。
        （一）日本帝国主义的存在，曾是中国灾难的
                    根源
    只要回溯一下中日两国最近七十余年来的历史关系，人们就会认识到：中国人民是绝对不能允许日本重新成为侵略国家的。从过去七十余年的中日关系中，中国人民所得到的血的历史教训，就是：日本任何侵略冒险的行动，首先遭害的必然是中国。
    自一八六八年明治维新之后，日本反动统治集团的侵略冒险政策，就一贯地以中国为其首要目标。一九二七年七月二十日当时日本首相田中义一，在向日皇所提出的奏摺里曾公开宣布：“如欲征服世界，必须先征服中国”，并说：“此乃明治大帝之遗策，是亦我日本帝国在存立上必要之条件。”对于这个狂妄的所谓“田中奏摺”，马歇尔在他任美国陆军参谋总长期间所做的两年度（一九四三—一九四五）报告书里，也认为是“日本政策的蓝本”。
        “田中奏摺”说：“……窃明治大帝之遗策，第一期征服台湾，第二期征服朝鲜”，而“第三期之灭亡满蒙”，又为“征服中国”之先决条件。七十多年来，日本帝国主义就是按照这个“明治大帝之遗策”对中国实行侵略的，日本对中国的侵略一步比一步加紧，而中国人民的苦难也就随之日益加深。一八九四年日本发动了中日战争，夺去了中国的台湾和澎湖列岛等地；一九○五年，日本战败沙皇俄国之后，攫去了对中国旅顺、大连的租让权，并将中国东北划为它的侵略势力范围；一九一四年，日本以自己是参加第一次世界大战的协约国方面为藉口，乘机攫取了德国帝国主义在山东的侵略特权；一九一五年，日本向中国提出了灭亡中国的二十一条件；一九三一年九月十八日，日本发动了侵略中国东北的战争，占领了中国东北四省；一九三二年一月二十八日，日本在上海发动了侵略战争；一九三五年，日本侵略中国华北，成立伪“冀东防共自治政府”，并与国民党卖国政府订立了侵害中国领土主权的“何梅协定”；一九三七年七月七日，日本发动了全面侵略中国的战争，一直至一九四五年八月被澈底击败为止。这一连串的历史事实，说明了中国人民在对日问题上的特殊关系，那就是：日本的侵略势力一日不被彻底剔除，中国的安全便一日得不到保障，中国人民便不能过和平安定的生活。
            （二）中国人民持久抗战，根本动摇了日本的
                        侵略计划
    中国人民抗日战争，是从一九三一年的“九一八”开始的。美国官方的历史文件——罗斯福总统于一九四一年十二月十五日向美国国会所提出的对日宣战咨文上，也曾说过：“日本之侵略，系于一九三一年在满洲开始”。从那时候起，中国人民就在中国共产党的领导下，对日本侵略者进行了坚决的抵抗，以后虽然经过许多困难和曲折，但是中国人民对日本侵略的抵抗并没有中断，并在一九三七年七月七日发动了全面抗战，一直坚持到最后胜利。
    中国人民对日作战不但发动最早、坚持最久，而且在一九四一年十二月七日以前十年多的艰苦战斗中，以独力抗击了日本的全部侵略力量。在那个漫长的岁月中，美英政府曾力图牺牲中国以与日本妥协，并不断地以大量作战物资卖给日本，加强了日本对中国人民的侵略力量，因而也就增加了中国人民抵抗日本侵略的困难。
    在太平洋战争爆发以后，由于中国人民在抗日战争中长期地积聚了力量，因而在一九四三年至一九四四年间，就能在敌后战场上对敌转入局部反攻。根据一九四四年不完全的统计，在那一年，中国人民在敌后战场上对敌作战达两万余次，毙伤敌伪军二十二万余人，俘虏敌伪军六万余人，伪军反正三万人，收复县城十八座，攻入县城四十七座，光复国土八万余平方公里，解放同胞一千二百万。中国人民在这个时期对日寇的进攻和打击，曾大大减轻了美英在太平洋上的作战负担。
    中国人民的持久抗战，长期地消耗与损伤了日寇的侵略力量。据中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会发表的统计，中国敌后战场（东北未计算在内）在八年抗战中，消灭日寇兵力达五十二万七千余人，其中包括毙伤五十二万余人，俘虏与投诚的近七千人；若连伪军的伤亡、俘虏与投降反正的数字计算在内，仅自一九三七年九月至一九四五年三月的七年半中，敌伪兵力的损失即达一百三十六万余人。至于日寇为了在中国人民的持久抗战中继续进行侵略战争而支付的财力、物力也是十分巨大的。日寇对华作战的军事预算，一九三七年为二十五亿日元，一九三八年为四十八亿五千万日元，一九三九年为四十六亿零五百万日元，一九四○年为五十四亿六千万日元，一九四一年为一百一十四亿八千万日元；
    一九四二年则增至一百八十亿日元。这样巨大的、累年的军事费用的消耗，曾造成日本战时经济的严重困难。此外，日寇为了达到“以战养战”的目的，在占领中国的东北、华北和华中的大部分土地以后，曾以大量的投资进行了所谓“开发”计划，计伪满的五年“建设”计划费用每年为十五亿日元，华北、华中四年“开发”计划费用每年为二十亿日元。而日寇的这些所谓“开发”计划，也都由于中国解放区战场对敌占区的不断进攻而遭受到严重的破坏。美国新闻处所编“对日战争”一书中，也曾说过：中国“游击队在敌后行动，他们能够牵制住敌人，并且阻止敌人在征服的地方获得政治的完全巩固和经济开发。”这样就使得日寇“以战养战”的计划也被彻底粉碎了。
    日寇原来期望在中国“速战速决”、“速和速结”、“以华制华”、“以战养战”，使中国成为它的“大东亚战争兵站基地”，然而它在侵略中国的战争中所得到的，却是在人力、物力和财力方面如此巨大而又无尽的消耗与损失，因而就不能不使得它的全盘侵略计划发生根本的动摇。
        （三）中国是对日作战的主要战场
    对日作战的全部历史事实证明了：中国自始至终是对日作战的主要战场；中国人民在长期反复的艰苦战斗中，所给予日本侵略者的打击，是对日战争取得胜利的最重要的条件。
    日本于一九三七年七月对中国发动全面进攻以后，在历年作战中，始终在中国战场上投放了最多的兵力，并不断被迫增加。在一九三七年开战后，日本在中国的兵力曾达到五十万人左右，一九三八年增加至六十八万人，一九三九年为八十六万人（以上数字东北未计在内），而至一九四一年六月以后，日本为了配合希特勒匪徒，准备随时向苏联东部边疆发动进攻，曾向中国东北大量增兵，使其在中国兵力总数在那年冬天达到一百七十余万人。其中的六十万余人对中国内地作战，另有四十万人则从事“讨伐”中国东北抗日联军的残酷战争。在一九四一年十二月七日以后，日本虽在太平洋上与美英开战，但并没有因此而减少它在中国的兵力，反而时有增加。以一九四五年八月的情形而论，当时日本在本土以外的全部作战兵力，陆军为三百二十余万人，海军为四十余万人，其中在中国地区的（包括东北和台湾）陆军为二百零七万三千人，海军十万二千余人；如将东北及台湾的兵力除外，在中国内地战场上，也有陆军一百一十七万三千人，海军三万五千余人；此外在朝鲜有陆军二十五万四千人，海军六万七千余人；而在太平洋各岛屿与美英作战的兵力则为数极为有限。这种情形，难道还不足以证明：中国是对日作战的主要战场；中国人民担负了对日作战的主要责任吗？
    在中国战场上，对日作战的主要责任又是由中国共产党所领导的中国人民的军队和解放区的地方武装所担任起来的。以八路军、新四军为主力的中国人民军队，从对日抗战一开始便进入敌后，对日寇展开了反进攻，收复了华北、华中许多地方，予日寇的进攻以严重的威胁。由于敌后游击战争的巨大发展，在一九三八年十月日寇占领武汉、广州以后，中国战场上便出现了战略相持阶段，日寇已经再不能前进了。这时，蒋介石反动政府采取了消极抗日、积极反共的反动政策；而日寇方面则停止了对正面战场的战略进攻，对蒋介石国民党实行政治诱降，并以主要的压力放在敌后战场，来进攻在他们后方进行游击战争的中国人民的军队。因而敌后战场便抗击了日寇和伪军的大部分力量，成为抗日战争的主要战线。在一九三八年十月以后的抗战过程中，敌后战场便始终抗击着百分之六十左右、最高达百分之七十五的侵华日军及百分之九十以上的伪军；如果把日伪军合计起来，则敌后战场所抗击的始终为敌伪兵力的百分之八十以上。这一事实，甚至可以从当时日寇官方材料中看出来。如日寇华北派遣军司令部所发表的一九四三年度综合报导中，即曾说过：“敌大半为中共军，与蒋军相反。在半年交战一万五千次中，和中共作战达七成五。在交战的二百万敌军中，半数以上也都是中共军。”因此，中国在对日战争中的伟大贡献与光荣战绩，主要是属于中国共产党所领导的中国人民方面的。
    中国的抗日战争是真正的人民战争。在毛泽东和中国共产党的正确领导下，中国人民在抗日战争中克服了蒋介石反动派对日投降妥协的危机，巩固和扩大了抗日民族统一战线，发展了自己的武装力量，因而不断地取得辉煌的胜利。在全面抗战的八年中，中国人民的武装力量累年扩大增强，其中主力部队八路军和新四军在一九三七年时只有九万二千人，到了一九四○年就已成为五十万人的强大部队，到一九四五年八月人数又增加了一倍多，计有一百二十九万七千余人，同时还有一九三八年建立和发展的华南抗日纵队两万余人，共合为一百三十一万八千余人。除了主力部队之外，各解放区还动员和组织了地方游击队和人民武装（民兵和人民自卫队），以与主力部队互相依靠，互相配合，对敌进行广泛的游击战争。根据一九四四年的统计，中国各解放区的民兵为一百六十八万五千余人，至一九四五年八月又增加了一百万余人，为二百六十八万七千余人；至于人民自卫队，根据一九四五年三月的统计，约在一千万人以上。如此强大的人民武装力量在广大的敌后战场上，到处袭击敌人，围困敌人，使敌陷于随时有灭顶之灾的人民战争的汪洋大海之中，而不能自拔。这种人民战争的无比威力，日寇在自己的严重失败中也不能不加以确认。日寇华北派遣军总司令部机关报“神兵”在一九四三年九月所发表的一篇社论中就曾这样说过：“中共的特点是各种各样，而最本质的特点就是他们的民众武装。如果近代战争特点是国民总力战的话，那末，中共战斗的特点，是最彻底的近代战争。”
    由于中国人民实现了毛泽东天才的人民战争的战略方针，经过八年苦战，在敌后光复了国民党反动政府所沦陷的大部分国土（国民党在抗战时期共丧失国土一百四十四万余平方公里），建立和巩固了面积达九十五万六千余平方公里的十九个大解放区（包括陕甘宁边区），使二亿六千万沦陷人口中将近一万万人得到了解放。尤其重要的是：这些解放区都是全国最重要的战略地区，所有为日寇所占领的全国重要城市，如北平、天津、保定、太原、济南、青岛、徐州、郑州、洛阳、开封、武汉、安庆、南京、镇江、上海、杭州、广州等，均处在我军包围之中；所有全国几千里海岸线和重要港口，均在我军控制和活动范围之内。这种形势就使得日寇虽然在中国战场上继续不断地投放了大量兵力，然而却不但不能解决战争，反而愈陷愈深。
    日寇既然以中国为其侵略战争的主要战场，同时并以“征服中国”为其“征服世界”的首要的和先决的条件，那末它在中国战场上的不断失败，就必然成为它最后完全崩溃的最重要和最严重的原因。
            （四）中国人民在抗战中的巨大牺牲
    中国人民在对日战争中的伟大贡献和光荣胜利，是以英勇战斗和流血牺牲所换取来的。中国人民为争取自己民族的独立生存与保障亚洲及世界的和平安全，在对日战争中付出的这种巨大的牺牲与代价，绝不是美英等国所能比拟的。
    在八年的艰苦战争中，为了打击敌人、保卫祖国而流血牺牲的中国人民战士，据一九四五年三月的不完全的统计，仅主力部队的伤亡数字即达四十四万六千七百余人；至于那些大义凛然、宁死不屈、与残暴的敌人战至最后一分钟的民兵和人民自卫队的牺牲数字，还未计算在内。
    日本侵略者是野蛮绝顶的敌人，它对中国人民的英勇抵抗曾采取了惨无人道的大规模屠杀和毁灭手段，企图使中国人民在残暴手段面前屈服。在一九三八年十月中国抗日战争进入战略相持阶段以后，日寇即对中国敌后战场进行了长期反复的残酷“扫荡”。每次“扫荡”都用了优势的兵力；其“扫荡”办法，有所谓“铁壁合围、捕捉奇袭、纵横扫荡、反转电击、辗转抉剔”。日寇在“扫荡”所到之处，都有计划地实行了烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光政策”，在伪满边境及山西五台等地还制造了长数百公里、宽数十公里的“无人区”，企图消灭中国人民军队的生存条件。并且，日寇为了“封锁”、“分割”、“蚕食”敌后抗日根据地，曾大批拆毁人民房屋田园，鞭使人民修筑碉堡、壕沟，使人民生活陷于极端痛苦之中。
    日寇在敌后所进行的灭绝人性的战争，使敌后中国人民遭受到了无比巨大的生命死亡与财产损失。据延安解放日报一九四六年一月十四日及其以后所发表的不完全的统计，在八年抗战中，仅晋绥、晋察冀、冀鲁豫、冀热辽、太行、山东、淮海、苏皖等八个解放区，被日寇所屠杀的人民即达三百零四万零一百七十二人，被捕去的壮丁达三百三十九万八千余人，被烧毁的房屋共一千七百八十三万七千八百余间，损失牲畜（缺太行区）一千五百八十六万七千一百余头，损失粮食（缺太行区）六亿一千七百一十一万余石，损失农具（缺太行、冀鲁豫）四千五百五十一万五千九百余件，损失被服（缺太行、冀鲁豫）八千二百八十三万四千八百余件。
    此外，日寇在它所控制和征服的占领区，也到处进行了疯狂的屠杀与掠夺，并对蒋介石反动政府所统治的中国城市曾加以野蛮的轰炸与破坏。日寇在它所侵占的中国各大城市，无不恣意烧杀与奸淫掳掠，犯下了惊人的血腥罪行。其中日寇在南京的大屠杀，尤使世界人民为之震怒。据远东国际法庭澳大利亚检察官穆澜对攻陷南京之日本派遣军司令官松井石根的总公诉书称：“南京失守后，日本在六周内，以残酷手段杀害的中国平民，计达二十六万至三十万人。日军奸淫了中国妇女计二万人，其中有年仅九岁及年达七十三岁者。”在其他各大城市，遭日寇残杀的中国人民也都有数万以至数十万。这些血债，也是中国人民所绝不能忘记的。
    至于日寇对中国工业的摧残，也是空前未有的。据前国民党反动政府经济部的调查，“八一三”后，上海被毁工厂达二千三百七十五家；上海以外，仅在国民党反动政府经济部注册的被毁工厂数，亦达一千四百六十五家，两者合计为三千八百四十家。这对于在中国本来已经很少的工业，是一个严重的损害。
    此外，由于日寇在中国实验和使用细菌武器、使用毒气等罪行，而引起的中国人民巨大死亡数字，更是无法加以计算的。
    总之，日本侵略者在侵略中国的战争中，像可憎的瘟疫一样，给中国人民带来了亘古未有的巨大灾难。据不完全的统计，在八年抗战中，中国人民因战争而死亡者达一千万人以上。在同一时期中，中国公共财产及战费的损失约值三百亿美元，私人财产的损失约值二百亿美元，两项合计达五百亿美元。
    所有这些事实都说明中国人民在对日战争中曾遭受巨大的牺牲并作了伟大的贡献，说明中国人民是战胜日本帝国主义的最重要力量之一。中国人民在对日战争中的这种作用和地位，决不是任何人所能抹杀或忽视的。
        二、苏联在对日战争中的贡献
    美帝国主义企图否认苏联在最后击败日本的战争中所起的决定性的作用，但是正如斯大林大元帅在一九四五年九月二日为对日战争胜利而发表的“告民众书”中所说的：“为了胜利，我们苏联人民是没有吝惜过力量和劳动的。”自“九一八事变”以后，苏联就一贯地打击着日本的侵略，在一九三七年七月七日以后，又以其政治的、经济的和军事的力量援助中国人民的抗日战争，并于一九四五年八月九日以军队参加对日作战，摧毁了日本侵略者的精锐部队关东军，使同盟国家对日战争得到了最后胜利。苏联在对日作战中作了不朽的贡献。
            （一）日本帝国主义一贯敌视苏联
    日本帝国主义一贯地敌视苏联，充当着帝国主义阵营在东方反苏宪兵的角色，并以此来邀得美英两国对它侵略中国和亚洲政策的让步。日本的侵略政策，就是要在一面积极反苏，一面积极进攻亚洲人民的冒险中，来实现它先独霸亚洲然后独霸世界的迷梦。
    被马歇尔称为“日本政策的蓝本”的“田中奏摺”，其中有一段这样的话：“日本帝国的命运注定要和俄国交锋。为了掌握满洲，将可能与俄国在蒙古草原上周旋；帝国应屯重兵于北满，俄国自不能等闲视之，必然出兵干涉，如此我们即可找到正式开战的藉口。”自俄国十月革命成功以后，日本就一直在寻找和制造进攻苏联的藉口，以侵夺苏联远东的领土。
        一九一八年，在苏联建立了社会主义国家之后不久，日本就在东方组织了帝国主义对苏联的武装干涉，侵占苏联远东国土达四年之久；一九三八年七月，日本从中国东北发动对苏联哈桑湖地区的进攻，在遭受到苏军的有力反攻和重大伤亡后，被迫停战；一九三九年五月，日本又从东北发动对蒙古人民共和国境内哈勒欣河地区的进攻，企图突入苏联外贝加尔湖地区，切断西伯利亚铁路干线。苏军与蒙古军队并肩作战，迎击了日本侵略军，在经过四个月的激烈战斗后，日军入侵部队被全部包围歼灭。哈桑湖和哈勒欣河两次战役严重地教训了日本侵略者，使它长期地不敢轻易侵犯苏联。
            （二）积极援助中国抗战，牵制大量日本兵力
    根据坚定的和平外交政策，苏联一贯地积极援助被侵略的国家。斯大林在一九三九年三月十日的第十八次联共（布）党代表大会上说：“我们与所有与苏联交邻的国家都是和平亲近善邻的关系……我们援助遭受侵略而为本国独立奋斗的民族。”
        “九一八事变”以后，苏联始终坚定地站在中国人民方面，支持中国人民的抗日斗争。一九三二年
    “一二八事变”爆发，苏联更积极建议恢复因国民党反动政府的敌视政策而中断了的中苏邦交；苏联外长李维诺夫并于同年十二月十二日即中苏恢复邦交的那一天正式表示：“苏联在道义上、精神上、感情上完全同情中国，并愿尽一切必要的援助。”
    一九三四年九月，苏联应邀加入国际联盟后，李维诺夫代表苏联政府在大会上正式谴责日本为侵略国。在日本侵略者践踏着中国东北和华北神圣领土的那个很长的黑暗日子里，在国际上只有苏联发出这样正义的声音，在精神上鼓励了中国人民对日本侵略者的反抗。
    七七抗战爆发以后，苏联援助中国最早，也最积极。一九三七年八月二十一日苏联与中国签订了互不侵犯协定，一九三九年六月十六日又签订了中苏通商航海条约，这个条约是近百年来中国与外国订立的第一个真正平等互惠的商约。同时，自一九三七至一九四○年间，苏联屡次贷给中国以巨额借款，总数共达三亿零六百三十八万五千八百美元，并将这些贷款折为军火，源源供给中国。中国抗战初期的飞机、坦克和其他许多武器，都是由此而来的。此外，苏联还派了许多军事专家来帮助中国，苏联人民并组织了志愿航空队来华参战，与中国人民并肩打击日本侵略者。其中有一百多位苏联志愿空军勇士，包括重轰炸机大队长库里申科和战斗机大队长拉赫曼诺夫，在作战中，为了中国人民的抗战事业而献出了他们宝贵的生命。这种珍贵的友情是中国人民所永不能忘记的。
    苏联对中国这种政治、军事和财政的援助，在中国人民抗日战争中发生了极为重要的作用。中国在抗战开始时，财力、物力是相当困难的，因而苏联那时对中国的援助，就大大地加强了中国人民的抗战力量。
    在苏联积极援助中国抗战的这个期间（一九三七——一九四○），中国是在单独对日作战；因此，这种援助也就是苏联在那个期间在对日作战中的重要的贡献。
    在一九四一年六月二十二日苏联为反抗希特勒匪徒背信弃义的进攻，而进入了伟大的卫国战争之后，苏联也从来没有松懈对日本帝国主义的戒备。苏联在一九四一至一九四五这四年中，始终在东部边境保持了四十个师的强大兵力，箝制了日本精锐部队关东军的全部力量。这就是说，虽然当时苏联并没有参加对日作战，但由于苏联牵制了日本大量的兵力，大大地便利了中国与美英的对日战争。
    日本侵略者曾积极准备了对苏联的进攻。在日本国家政策研究会于一九四一年所拟订的“大东亚共荣圈计划”中，有一章是“苏维埃领土的未来”，其中规定着德日两国共同瓜分苏联，而且规定着德日两国的国境线以鄂木斯克为界。在希特勒德国开始进攻苏联之后，日本便在中国的东北集结兵力，准备等待有利时机，以实现它与希特勒匪徒会师鄂木斯克的梦想。
        一九四一年六月，在东北的日本关东军共计四十八万人，可是到了同年的九月一日，已增加到一百万人，并配备了五千门大炮，一千辆坦克，一千架飞机。如果再加上集中在朝鲜、内蒙古和南库页岛的军队，那么这时候日本准备用以对付苏联的兵力，就要占它地面部队总数的一半（当时日本陆军总数是二百一十万人）。一九四二年八月，希特勒匪徒发动斯大林格勒大战之后，日寇又重新加强其在东北的兵力，人数达一百一十万人（当时日本陆军总数为二百四十万）；并且还成立了两个参谋部：一为齐齐哈尔的北线参谋部，一为在牡丹江的东线参谋部。
    上面的事实显然地说明了：日本曾经等待过莫斯科或者斯大林格勒的陷落，不过日本侵略者所等待的这样有利的时机并未发生。希特勒匪徒在莫斯科溃退了，其后又在斯大林格勒遭到悲惨失败。但是日本侵略者并没有因此而完全放弃了它进攻苏联的罪恶计划，一直到一九四五年时，它依然在东北、朝鲜保持了将近一百万的兵力。
    一九四一年至一九四五年，苏联在卫国战争最艰苦的时期，也牵制了日本精锐部队关东军的全部力量，对于对日战争作了重要贡献。这是一个重要的、不可忽视的事实。
            （三）苏联对日参战，促成日本的失败和投降
    一九四五年二月十一日，苏联还在全力对德作战的时候，即在美英苏三国领袖举行的雅尔达会议上，同意在击败希特勒德国后参加对日作战。雅尔达协定中规定：“苏美英三强领袖同意，在德国投降及欧洲战争结束后两个月或三个月内苏联将参加同盟国方面对日作战”。
        一九四五年五月八日，苏联在对德战争中取得了完全的胜利，使日本侵略者在全世界范围内陷于孤立与绝望的地步。这种形势，日本法西斯政府也开始感觉到了。他们一面在一九四五年六月九日的“御前会议”上，决定“为维护国体，保卫皇土”而准备“决战”，一面又向苏联提出调停远东和平的请求，进行外交的欺诈，以拖延时间，避免投降。苏联忠实于对盟国的义务，拒绝了日本的请求，并于
    一九四五年八月九日对日宣战。八月十日，蒙古人民共和国也对日宣战，并以军队与苏军并肩参加对日作战。
    一九四五年八月九日起，苏联以强大的陆空军与太平洋舰队参加对日作战，向在东北的日本关东军展开了猛烈的攻势，苏联红军以雷霆万钧的力量，突破了日军的防线，摧毁了日军的抵抗。在八月九日至二十二日的十四天内，苏军以迅速勇猛的战斗，在中国东北境内向前推进了五百公里至九百五十公里，解放了全部东北、库页岛南部和千岛群岛。日本的关东军在这一猛烈的打击下迅速瓦解。由一九四五年八月九日至九月九日这一个月的期间，向苏军投降的日军官兵达五十九万四千人，被击毙的达八万多。日寇的伤亡总数，在六十七万四千人以上。
    苏联的参战和对日本关东军的毁灭性的打击，促成了日本的投降。在苏联参战以前，日本侵略者还打算凭借着中国的东北和朝鲜为其后方，来进行“本土决战”的，因此在本土和东北保持了它大部分的兵力。当时日本的全部兵力为七百五十万，在本土、东北和朝鲜的共四百八十余万（内中有一百二十万是海军）。苏联的参战，使日本“决战”的计划澈底破产。苏军迅速摧毁了日本的精锐的主力部队关东军，迅速解放了东北和朝鲜，因而剥夺了日本进行“决战”的一切凭借，而使它不得不屈服投降。
    上面的事实无可争辩地证明：苏联的参战最后改变了远东的形势，缩短了战争，对结束对日战争作了最重要的贡献。（未完待续）
