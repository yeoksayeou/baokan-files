Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th. The New York "Worker's Daily" editorial wrote: The peace treaty with Japan, drafted by Wall Street lawyer Dulles and Acheson, is a "diplomatic 'Pearl Harbor'" for the American people. It means a greater danger of war for the United States. The paper said: Washington politicians have committed the crime of endangering US security, damaging US reputation, and endangering the lives of millions of Americans.

The paper continued: By concluding such a treaty, the United States has incurred the hatred of the majority of mankind. The editorial also said: This treaty has not been approved by the Japanese people. The Japanese people hate this kind of deal, "This kind of deal would never be approved by the people if a referendum were held, of course Washington and Yoshida would never dare to hold such a vote. ...The fact is that Acheson's deal must be imposed on the Japanese people by force, no less than the various deals with the fascist Franco, the fascist Tito, and the Greek royalist fascists."

The paper concluded: "We have been pushed a big step closer to national disaster, and the people must work harder than ever to fight for peace."

    美“工人日报”痛斥单独对日和约
    并指出杜勒斯之流已经危害了美国安全
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】纽约“工人日报”社论写道：华尔街律师杜勒斯和艾奇逊拟定的对日和约，对美国人民来说，是“外交上的‘珍珠港事件’”。它对美国意味着更大的战争危险。该报说：华盛顿的政客们已经犯了危害美国安全、毁坏美国名誉、危及美国千百万人生命的罪行。
    该报继续说：由于缔结这样一个条约，美国惹起了人类大多数的仇恨。社论又说：这个条约决没有得到日本人民的赞同。日本人民仇视这种勾当，“这种勾当如果举行一次公民投票，是决不会得到人民的赞同的，当然华盛顿与吉田都根本不敢举行这种投票。……事实是艾奇逊的勾当是必需要以强力才能加在日本人民身上的，其强制的程度决不亚于和法西斯佛朗哥、法西斯铁托及希腊保皇法西斯分子的各种勾当。”
    该报在结语中说：“我们已经被人推了一大步，更接近民族灾难了，人民必须用比以前更大的努力来争取和平。”
