Comrades,

    Let me, on behalf of the China Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association and the Chinese people, warmly welcome you back to the country to participate in the second National Day celebration of our great motherland.

    Comrades, in order to combat the world's most barbaric American imperialist aggression, for the sake of our motherland's security, and to help our neighbor, the Korean people, you resolutely crossed the Yalu River and went to the forefront of Resist-America Aid-Korea.

    Comrades, thanks to the heroic joint fight of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, brilliant victories have been achieved in the past year, a large number of enemies have been annihilated, and the fierce flames of American imperialist aggression have been severely hit.

    Comrades, with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, you have made great contributions to the great cause of defending world peace. Your great and just actions have won the high respect and warm support of the Chinese people and even the people of the world. The China Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association has mobilized all the people of the motherland to vigorously support you, and is currently carrying out patriotic pacts, donating weapons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The people of the whole country have made the Resist-America Aid-Korea work their top priority. Patriotic pacts are being universally and deeply implemented in factories, rural areas, business circles, students, and all corners. As of now, the weapon donation, for fighter planes alone, has reached two thousand four hundred and eighty-one. The work of giving preferential treatment to military families is also continuing.

    Comrades, you are here to celebrate the National Day of the motherland. National Day is the fruit of your victory. Your participation in the National Day means that you have seen the fruit of victory created under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. On behalf of the China Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association, I extend my cordial greetings and pay my highest respects to you, and wish the great Resist-America Aid-Korea War a final victory.
