Beijing China Construction Company's Experiences in Opposing Foremen
By Shi Zhendong, Chairman of the Trade Union of China Construction Company

    The China Construction Company originally used the method of organizing engineering teams to abolish the foreman system. The company recruited workers, organized them into teams according to their trades, and elected representatives from each team to directly sign collective piece-rate contracts with the company. Workers' wages were democratically assessed according to the company's established grades, and then directly paid to the workers by the company. On the surface, this system seemed to have overthrown the foreman system. However, when we began to organize on-site trade unions, we found that the foremen's exploitation and oppression of workers still existed.

            Foremen Cruelly Exploit Workers

    Regarding the issue of wages, because the company used the collective piece-rate system, the foremen first played tricks with the number of workers. One method was that a foreman would occupy a share of the wages as soon as he arrived at a construction site, and even after he left, this quota would still have to be reserved for him. A foreman at the New Urban District construction site went to Tianjin to take on work, and the workers still had to reserve a share for him. Another method was to exploit apprentices. Foremen brought many apprentices and falsely reported them as skilled workers, which also exploited other workers. At the Ministry of Culture construction site, foreman Yang Xi reported four apprentices who had only been learning for a few months as earning the same wages as skilled workers, but these apprentices did not receive this money. The foreman told the apprentices: "This is what I asked for you to earn more." He forced the apprentices to hand it all over to him, and then he would issue each person a "subsidy" of 20,000 yuan per month.

    The foremen also wanted to grab a share of the extra bonuses earned through collective piecework. On the one hand, they demanded "hardship money" from the workers, and on the other hand, they forced the workers to elect the foreman and his cronies as "labor models," who would receive 20% of the bonus stipulated by the company's piece-rate system. For example, foreman Yang Fengxi at a certain construction site, who usually only used his mouth and didn't lift a finger, often asked the workers to elect him as a "first-class labor model." Some foremen even openly took more. For example, foreman Zhang Guangyi took one million yuan for himself out of a bonus of more than two million yuan. They also cruelly exploited workers in managing meals. For example, foreman Jing Xueru, in managing the meals of 130 workers, employed two accountants and four cooks. These few people ate and drank heavily with the workers' meal expenses every day. In just ten days, they spent 997,000 yuan of the food expenses, while giving the workers salted vegetables and corn buns, costing only 5,000 yuan per day. Worker Li Guangcai worked for ten days and was told he owed the foreman more than 1,800 yuan when settling accounts.

    The foremen also politically dominated the workers. If a worker wanted to join the trade union, the foreman would say that the worker was "disobeying leadership" and dismiss him on the pretext. When the company developed long-term workers, and the workers wanted to participate, the foreman would first say: "With a trowel stuck in your waist, you earn a lot of money. If you join the engineering team, they won't let you go home." Seeing that this didn't work, they would dismiss several workers first, making others afraid. The workers had no choice but not to mention joining.

    To do a good job of engineering, workers must be thoroughly liberated from the rule of the foremen. Therefore, we resolved to launch an anti-foreman movement.

        Mobilize Workers to Isolate Foremen

    The key to the victory of the anti-foreman struggle is to mobilize the masses of workers and isolate the foremen. We roughly used four methods to mobilize workers and win them over from the rule of the foremen:

    1. The company explicitly stipulated that foremen had no right to dismiss workers, and the company's dismissal of workers must also be approved by the trade union. Although foremen can certainly exploit many loopholes in the implementation of this provision, having this provision means that foremen dare not dismiss workers on a large scale; exploiting loopholes is always illegal and cannot be done every day. In this way, the prestige of the trade union is improved, and workers can easily approach the trade union.

    2. After collecting materials on the foremen, help the workers publicly settle accounts with the foremen for exploitation, defeat the foremen's prestige, raise the workers' awareness, and increase the workers' determination to struggle.

    3. Explain the state's policies to the workers and foremen, stating that foremen will not be allowed to exploit workers again, and workers can rely on the government and trade unions to find employment in the future.

    4. In places where the foremen's power is particularly strong and the workers are difficult to mobilize, we first temporarily transfer the foremen away from the construction site, mobilize the workers, and then transfer them back, where the workers can hold a meeting to accuse him. If there are few workers at a construction site, workers from several construction sites can be gathered together to hold a meeting, which not only shows greater strength, but also educates more workers and foremen.

        Treat Large and Small Foremen Separately

    In the struggle, our policy towards the foremen is: those with serious crimes are sent to the court for judgment according to law; the "system is opposed, but the technology is used" for small and medium foremen (foremen in the construction industry are mostly skilled workers with certain skills). We recognize that the main force for completing the project is the workers, not a few foremen. Therefore, we resolutely launched an anti-foreman struggle in twenty construction sites.

    In the past four months, we have eliminated twenty-three foremen. Facts have proven that after the foremen are eliminated, the project continues as usual, and the more thoroughly the foremen are eliminated, the higher the workers' enthusiasm for production, the better the project quality, and the more materials are saved. After opposing the foreman at the Bank of Communications construction site, the workers created a new record of mixing a plate of cement in two minutes, and the "honeycomb" was also the least.

            Several Issues Worth Noting

    From our experience in the anti-foreman struggle, I think there are several issues worth raising for future attention:

        1. After the foremen are eliminated, the patriarchal leadership style of the on-site technical management cadres will immediately be opposed by the workers. Because these people have relied on the foremen to manage the workers for many years, they originally had a feeling of "if the foremen are opposed, there will be no one to rely on." When the workers raise some opinions, they feel even more that it is "difficult to lead" and that "there is trouble with the trade union." Not only do they not support the trade union, but they also stand in opposition to the trade union, which greatly weakens the force of the struggle against the foremen. Therefore, before opposing the foremen, they must be well united and educated to enlighten them to recognize the power of the workers; after opposing the foremen, they must be helped to change their leadership style and establish a democratic management system.

    2. After opposing the foremen, further ideological education must be carried out among the workers to let them know that basic construction is a major plan for the country for a hundred years, and doing a good job of construction means loving the country and resisting America and aiding Korea.

    3. Attention must be paid to solving the workers' living welfare, safety, and health issues to consolidate the workers' enthusiasm.

    4. After initially opposing the foremen, we must not relax when the foremen counterattack. How much effort they use to counterattack, we will use that much effort to defeat them again. Special care should be taken of the workers brought by the foremen, so that "opposing the foremen does not result in workers leaving." That would give other foremen the opportunity to exploit loopholes and may somewhat affect the allocation of labor. (Originally published in "Worker's Daily")

    北京中国建筑公司反把头的经验
    中国建筑公司工会主席  师振宗
    中国建筑公司，原先是用组织工程队的办法来废除把头制度的。公司招来工人，按工种编队，按队选出代表，和公司直接订立集体计件包工合同。工人的工资，根据公司规定的等级，民主评定，然后由公司直接发到工人手里。这种制度，表面看来，好像已把把头制度打倒了。可是，当我们开始组织现场工会的时候，却发现把头对工人的剥削和压迫，照旧存在。
            把头残酷剥削工人
    关于工资问题，因为公司用了集体计件的办法，把头首先是在人数上来打主意：一种办法是，把头到一个工地就占一份工资，他走了还得留着这个名额。新市区工地把头到天津包活去了，工人也得给他留一份。再一种办法是，从徒弟身上剥削，把头带了许多徒弟，硬报技工，这也就剥削了其他工人。文化部工地把头杨喜四个才学了几个月的徒弟都和技工挣同样工资，但这些钱徒弟并得不到。把头对徒弟说：“这是我叫你多挣的。”逼着徒弟一齐交给他，他再每月发给每人两万元“津贴”。
    集体计件得到的超额奖励，把头们也要捞一把，他们一方面向工人要“辛苦钱”，一方面逼着工人选举把头和把头的亲信作“劳动模范”，坐得公司规定的计件中百分之二十的奖金。如某工地把头杨凤喜，平日只动嘴不动手，常叫工人选他当“头等劳动模范”。有些把头甚至公开多拿。如把头张广义，在二百多万元的红利中，自己就拿一百万。在办伙食上他们也残酷地剥削工人。例如把头荆学儒，在管理一百三十人工人的伙食中，用了两个管账的，四个伙夫。他们几人，每天用工人的伙食费大吃大喝，十来天中，还分着花了伙食款九十九万七千元，每天给工人吃咸菜、窝头，每天要算五千元。工人李广才干了十天，算账时倒找把头一千八百多元。
    把头们在政治上也统治着工人。工人要加入工会，把头就说工人“不服从领导”，借故开除。公司发展长期工，工人想参加，把头先说：“瓦刀腰中一插，挣的工钱又大，参加工程大队，人家不叫回家。”看看不行，就先下手开除几个工人，使其他人害怕。工人只好不提参加的话。
    要搞好工程，就要使工人彻底从把头统治中解放出来，因此，我们决心展开反把头运动。
        发动工人孤立把头
    反把头斗争胜利的关键是发动工人群众，孤立把头。我们大致用了四种方法来发动工人和从把头统治下争取工人：
    一、公司明文规定把头没有解雇工人的权，公司解雇工人也要经工会同意。这一条实行中把头固然有许多空子可钻。但有了这个规定，把头决不敢大批开除；钻空子总是不合法的，也不能天天钻。这样工会威信提高了，工人就容易靠近工会。
    二、搜集到把头材料后，帮助工人公开地向把头算剥削账，打倒把头威风，提高工人觉悟，增加工人斗争决心。
    三、向工人和把头交代国家的政策，提出决不容许把头再剥削工人，工人以后可以依靠政府和工会找到职业。
    四、把头势力特别大的地方，工人不好发动，我们先把把头暂时调离工地，发动起工人，再调他回去，由工人开会控诉他。如工地工人少，可集中几个工地的工人一齐开，既显得力量大，又可更多地教育工人和把头。
        大小把头分别处理
    我们在斗争中，对待把头的方针是：罪恶大的送法院依法判决；对中小把头就“反他的制度，用他的技术”（建筑业的把头多是技工出身，有一定的技术）。我们认清完成工程的主要力量是工人，不是几个把头，因此，坚决地在二十个现场中展开了反把头斗争。
    四个月来，我们已经反掉了二十三个把头。事实证明，反掉了把头以后，工程照常进行，而且，把头反得愈彻底的地方，工人生产热情愈高，工程质量愈好，材料节约愈多。交通银行工地反把头后，工人创造了两分钟拌一盘洋灰的新纪录，“蜂窝”还最少。
            值得注意的几个问题
    从我们的在反把头斗争中，我觉得有几个问题值得提出来今后注意：
        一、把头反掉了，现场技术管理干部那套家长式的领导作风就立刻会遭到工人的反对。这些人由于多年依靠把头管理工人，本来就有“反了把头没有依靠了”的感觉，工人再给提点意见，更觉“不好领导”，觉得“有了工会就有了麻烦”，不但不支持工会反而和工会对立，这就大大削弱了向把头斗争的力量。因此，反把头以前，要很好地团结和教育他们，启发他们认识工人的力量；反了把头以后，要帮助他们改变领导作风，树立民主管理制度。
    二、反了把头，要进一步给工人进行思想教育，让工人知道：基本建设是国家的百年大计，搞好建设就是爱护国家，就是抗美援朝。
    三、要注意解决工人生活福利、安全卫生等问题，才能巩固工人热情。
    四、初步反掉把头后，把头反攻过来时，不能松劲。他用多大气力反过来，我们就用多大气力再给他打下去。并对把头带来的工人，要特别加以照顾，不要弄得“反掉把头，走了工人”。那样会给其他把头钻空子的机会，也可能多少影响劳动力的调配。（原载“工人日报”）
