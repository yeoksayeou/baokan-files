    North China County Magistrate Conference
    Investigations and Studies Conducted During Two Months of Preparation
    [This newspaper dispatch] The preparatory work for the first North China County Magistrate Conference convened by the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government had one very prominent feature: the in-depth investigation and research work and the study movement of documents on democratic regime construction.
    In mid-July, while the North China Affairs Department issued a notice convening the meeting, stipulating that governments at all levels should organize cadres to study important documents on the construction of democratic regimes, combined with the inspection and summarization of the work of the People's Representative Conference and preferential treatment work; at the same time, the preparatory committee also sent four inspection teams to various places to investigate. This aroused the attention of various localities to the preparatory work for the meeting. In addition to promptly instructing the special districts, cities, and county people's governments to actively prepare for the county magistrate conference, the Shanxi Provincial Deputy Chairman Wang Shiying and Civil Affairs Director Zhang Xuan personally led working groups to Linfen, Yuncheng, and other counties to systematically conduct investigations and research and summarize work experience. Jin Cheng, Deputy Chairman of Hebei Province, gave a study report on the construction of democratic regimes to cadres, and the Provincial People's Government held several reporting meetings to promote the study of the People's Daily editorial on this issue by government cadres at all levels and conducted work reviews. Other provincial people's governments also attached importance to the preparation for this meeting. All special districts and county regime work cadres in the North China region, with the exception of a very few areas that suffered severe floods, insect plagues, or droughts, persisted in their studies. Some counties adopted the method of combining document study with visits, convening symposiums of representatives from all walks of life, symposiums of labor models, and various forms of investigation meetings, which yielded great results. In August and September, the heads of various localities took charge, personally took action, and generally summarized the work of regime construction and preferential treatment work. More than 300 written summaries, investigation reports, and study reports submitted by various localities to the North China Affairs Department fully reflected the actual situation and work experience of various counties, which will play a significant role in the success of this North China County Magistrate Conference.
    Facts have proven that this method of preparing for meetings makes the process of meeting preparation a process of improving cadres' ideological understanding, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and practically promoting work. Since 1949, all counties and banners in the North China region have generally convened multiple People's Representative Conferences. Most county people's governments generally complete major tasks through the People's Representative Conference, uniting people from all walks of life. Cadres and the people attach great importance to the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference, so various work tasks can be completed more effectively. Especially recently, various localities have vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries, and most counties have submitted this work to the People's Representative Conference for thorough discussion. Some cadres and people's representatives even took the case files of counter-revolutionary criminals to the countryside to solicit public opinions, mobilize the masses to assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionary activities, and achieved particularly significant results. The political awareness of the broad masses of people is increasing day by day; the People's Government has fully realized democracy for the people and dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries. This fact shows that state power is already firmly in the hands of the people, and the people have gained rich experience in exercising state power.
    However, it must be pointed out that many cadres do not pay enough attention to the People's Representative Conference, simply thinking that "the People's Representative Conference can complete central tasks" and "can publicize policies," without fully recognizing that it is a basic national system. Therefore, some counties have turned the People's Representative Conference into ordinary cadre meetings, not caring about the people's own affairs, not paying attention to the proposals of the people's representatives, and lacking full consultation. In the election of representatives, some counties still have shortcomings such as closed-doorism and formalism. However, during this study process, cadres re-studied Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, and the "Organizational Regulations for County People's Representative Conferences," and carried out criticism and self-criticism in conjunction with the People's Daily editorials and reports on regime construction work. As a result, cadres' ideological understanding of regime construction work has been improved. Many commissioners and county magistrates have written study心得 [xinde, reflections], summarized their own work experience, and initially realized the importance of national democratization. In the past month or so, the People's Representative Conferences held in Mancheng and Tongxian counties in Hebei Province, Linfen in Shanxi Province, and other key experimental counties have overcome the aforementioned major shortcomings. All of these illustrate that this study of regime construction documents and work inspection and summary has sufficiently prepared the ideological groundwork for the North China County Magistrate Conference.

    华北县长会议
    在两个月筹备期间进行了调查和学习
    【本报讯】中央人民政府华北事务部召开的华北第
    一次县长会议的筹备工作，有一个最显明的特点，就是进行了深入的调查研究工作和开展了民主政权建设工作文件的学习运动。
    七月中旬，华北事务部一方面发出召开会议的通知，规定各级人民政府应组织干部学习民主政权建设工作的重要文件，结合检查与总结人民代表会议工作和优抚工作；同时筹备委员会还派出四个视察组分赴各地考察，因而引起了各地对会议准备工作的重视。各省人民政府除及时指示专区、市和县人民政府应积极做好县长会议准备工作外，山西省副主席王世英、民政厅长张?轩曾率领工作组亲赴临汾、运城等县，系统地进行调查研究，总结工作经验。河北省副主席金城给干部作了民主政权建设学习报告，省人民政府并召开了多次汇报会议，推动了各级政府工作干部学习人民日报有关这个问题的社论，并作了工作检讨。其他各省人民政府也都重视这次会议的准备工作。华北全区各专区和各县政权工作干部，除极少数发生严重水灾、虫灾、旱灾的地区外，都坚持了学习。有些县采取学习文件与访问结合的办法，分别召开了各界代表座谈会、劳动模范座谈会及各种形式的调查会，收效很大。八、九两月，各地由首长负责，亲自动手，普遍总结了政权建设工作和优抚工作。各地送交华北事务部的书面总结、考查报告及学习报告达三百多件，充分地反映了各县的实际情况及工作经验，对开好这次华北县长会议将发生很大作用。
    事实证明：这种筹备会议的方法，使会议准备的过程就是一个提高干部思想认识、开展批评和自我批评、实际推动工作的过程。华北全区各县、旗，自一九四九年以来，已普遍召开过多次人民代表会议，多数县人民政府一般地都把重大工作通过人民代表会议、团结各界人民共同去完成。凡是人民代表会议的决议，干部与人民都很重视，因而各种工作任务能够完成得更好。特别是最近期间，各地大张旗鼓镇压反革命，大多数县份把这一工作提交人民代表会议周密讨论。有的干部和人民代表还携带反革命罪犯的案卷下乡，征求群众意见，发动群众协助政府肃清反革命活动，成绩尤为显著。广大人民的政治觉悟日益提高；人民政府充分实现了对人民的民主和对于反革命分子的专政。这一事实说明国家政权业已牢固地握在人民手中，人民行使国家政权也已经取得丰富经验。
    但是必须指出，不少干部对人民代表会议还不够重视，单纯地认为“人民代表会议能完成中心工作”，“能宣传政策”，而没有充分认识到它是国家的基本制度。因此有些县把人民代表会议开成了普通干部会议，不关心人民自己的事务，不重视人民代表的提案，缺乏充分的协商。在代表选举上，有的县还存在着关门主义和形式主义等缺点。但在这次学习过程中，干部重新学习了毛主席的“论人民民主专政”、刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话和“县人民代表会议组织通则”等文件，同时结合人民日报有关政权建设工作的社论和报道，开展了批评和自我批评。因此，干部对政权建设工作的思想认识提高了。许多专员、县长都写了学习心得，总结了自己工作中的经验，初步体会了国家民主化的重要性。最近一个多月来，河北省满城、通县、山西临汾等重点试验县召开的人民代表会议，已克服了前述各项主要缺点。这些都说明了，这次建政文件的学习和工作检查总结，已经相当充分地为华北县长会议做好了思想准备工作。
