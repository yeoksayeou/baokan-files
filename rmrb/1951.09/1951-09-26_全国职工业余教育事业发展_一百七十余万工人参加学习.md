The spare-time education program for workers has developed nationwide, with over 1.7 million workers participating in learning. The spare-time education undertaking for workers in various regions has seen significant development.

Spare-time education for workers in various regions has played a significant role in improving the political, cultural, and technical levels of workers. Illiteracy among workers has been greatly reduced. For example, after a year of study, more than 4,000 of the more than 10,000 employees in four mines and eleven factories in Fushun City can read popular newspapers and periodicals and write simple practical texts. A large number of workers who have received spare-time cultural education have participated in various spare-time technical studies. Fushun Coal Mine alone has more than 700 spare-time school students who have been recommended to technical schools for further study. The Jiang'an Bridge Factory of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration established technical classes in its spare-time school to train junior technicians, which tripled work efficiency. In the past year, more than 800 apprentices at the Anshan Machine Repair Factory in Northeast China were promoted to formal workers after completing spare-time technical studies. Xie Shishan, a worker at the Dalian Fisheries Company Ice Plant, was promoted from an ordinary technical worker to factory director because of his hard work in learning culture and mastering modern technology.

Workers in various regions have shown a high degree of consciousness in their studies. In Shanghai alone, more than 6,000 learning models have emerged. Workers in Xi'an, Yantai, and Fushun Coal Mine have listed persistence in learning as one of the challenge and response conditions for patriotic production competitions. Through the political education of spare-time schools, general students can play an active role in production, and many backward workers have changed their work attitudes. Most of them are able to actively respond to various calls in the school and enthusiastically participate in movements such as increasing production and donating. Last winter, more than 2,000 students in Shanghai signed up to participate in military cadre schools, and more than 3,000 students participated in winter defense work. The Second District Workers' Spare-Time School in Changsha City, Hunan Province, because of its usual attention to current affairs and political education in cultural education, 64 of the school's 350 students signed up to participate in military cadre schools.

Since the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened the First National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education last September, various regions, in accordance with the spirit of the meeting, have established and improved workers' spare-time education committees at all levels, with the government education departments taking the lead, and corrected the past deviations in workers' spare-time education, such as the lack of unified leadership or laissez-faire. In terms of work guidelines, except for some factories and mines that still need to carry out a certain period of political enlightenment education for employees, most of them have clearly focused on cultural education. Various localities have also mobilized a large number of workers to enroll in schools by means of enlightenment methods such as workers complaining about illiteracy, and have encouraged teachers' teaching enthusiasm. In terms of teaching methods, most localities have paid attention to overcoming the shortcomings of demanding "formalization," and have adopted methods such as teaching in pitheads, factories, and docks, and flexibly adjusting class schedules to adapt to workers' production time and living conditions. In industries with greater mobility, auxiliary methods such as self-study tutoring, mutual teaching and learning, and the "little teacher" system are used to make up for the lack of regular teaching time. However, various localities have also actively corrected chaotic phenomena such as the lack of a definite study plan, organization, system, textbooks, and fixed teachers. In this way, workers' spare-time education in various regions has gradually moved from development to consolidation. In Northeast China, more than 425,000 workers have participated in spare-time learning, and most of them have developed the habit of regular study. Most of the workers' spare-time schools in Jiangxi Province have established systems such as leave, attendance, examination, and reward. In Changsha, Hunan Province, more than 90% of the students in spare-time schools do not miss classes.

In the work of spare-time education, there are still some deviations and problems. For example, some spare-time schools only conduct current affairs and political education, neglecting cultural education, while others only conduct cultural education, without infiltrating or combining with current affairs and political education. There is also a certain degree of disconnection between technical education and cultural education. Many places, eager for quick results, often set up workers' technical schools before workers' cultural levels have improved, so that teaching has not achieved the desired results. The leadership organizations of some enterprises lack unified planning for various tasks, and there are also shortcomings in arbitrarily working overtime in production competitions, so the spare-time teaching time is not guaranteed. Many cadres and activists in factories and mines cannot persist in learning because they have too many concurrent positions. In addition, the curriculum and length of study of spare-time schools in various regions lack unified standards, and there is also a lack of planned and systematic leadership for teaching business, so the general teaching quality is poor. In some places, spare-time schools have a shortage of teachers due to the surge in students, and school funding has also experienced certain difficulties. Some teachers do not have a sufficient understanding of the prospects of workers' education and are not at ease in their work due to low pay. These problems are being studied and resolved.

    全国职工业余教育事业发展
    一百七十余万工人参加学习
    全国各地参加业余文化学习的工人已超过一百七十万人。各地职工业余教育事业已有很大发展。
    各地职工业余教育在提高工人的政治、文化和技术水平上起了很大作用。工人中文盲已大见减少。如抚顺市四个矿、十一个厂的一万多职工经过一年学习后，已有四千多人能阅读通俗报刊和写简单应用文字。受到业余文化教育的工人群众大量参加各种业余技术学习，单抚顺煤矿就有七百多个业余学校的学员被保送到技术学校去学习。郑州铁路管理局江岸桥梁厂在业余学校里创办技术班培养了初级技术人员，使工作效率提高了三倍。东北鞍山机器修理厂在去年一年中就有八百多学徒经过业余技术学习后，被提升为正式工人。大连渔业公司制冰厂工人谢世山，因努力学文化，掌握了现代化技术，已从一个普通技术工人升为厂长了。
    各地工人在学习中表现了高度的自觉性，上海一地就涌现出学习模范六千余人。西安、烟台、抚顺煤矿的工人把坚持学习列为爱国主义生产竞赛的挑战应战条件之一。经过业余学校的政治教育，一般学员都能在生产中起积极作用，不少落后工人转变了工作态度。他们大都能够积极响应学校里的各种号召，踊跃地参加增产捐献等运动。去冬上海并有二千余学员报名参加军事干部学校，三千多学员参加了冬防工作。湖南长沙市第二区职工业余学校因平时注意在文化教育中进行时事、政治教育，该校三百五十余学员里就有六十四名报名参加军事干部学校。
    自去年九月中央人民政府教育部召开第一届全国工农教育会议后，各地遵照会议精神，纷纷以政府教育部门为主，建立与健全了各级职工业余教育委员会，纠正了过去职工业余教育工作中缺少统一领导或自流等偏向。在工作方针上，除了某些尚需向职工进行一定时期政治启蒙教育的厂、矿外，一般的都明确地以文化教育为重点。各地并以文盲诉苦等启发方式，动员了大批工人入学，并激励了教师的教学情绪。在教学方式上各地大多注意克服强求“正规”的缺点，曾采取了坑口、工场、码头教学和灵活调整班次等办法，以适应职工生产时间及居住情况。在流动性较大的行业中又采用自学辅导、互教互学、小先生制等辅助方式，以弥补正规教学时间的不足。但各地也积极地纠正了无一定学习计划、组织、制度、课本及无固定教员等混乱现象。这样，各地职工业余教育逐渐由发展走向巩固。东北各地参加业余学习的工人已有四十二万五千余人，一般的已养成了经常学习的习惯。江西省的职工业余学校，大都已建立了请假、考勤、考试、奖励等制度。湖南长沙的业余学校学员不缺课的要占到百分之九十以上。
    在业余教育工作中，也还存在着若干偏向和问题。如有的业余学校单纯进行时事、政治教育，偏废了文化教育，有的又单纯进行文化教育，不渗透或结合进行时事、政治教育。技术教育与文化教育也存在着某种程度的脱节现象。不少地方因急于求成，往往等不到工人文化水平提高，就举办工人技术学校，使教学未能收到应有效果。有些企业的领导组织对各项工作缺乏统一的筹划，加上生产竞赛中又有任意加班加点的缺点，因而业余教学时间没有保证。很多厂、矿的干部和积极分子因兼职太多，无法坚持学习。另外，各地业余学校的课程、学制缺乏统一的标准，对教学业务也缺少有计划、有系统的领导，因此一般教学质量较差。有些地方业余学校因学生激增，教员缺额甚多，学校经费也发生一定的困难。有些教员对职工教育事业前途认识不足，且因待遇低而不安心工作。这些问题正在研究解决中。（新华社）
