The donation movement of the Zhengzhou business community stagnated for a period from July to early August. In early August, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce conducted a review and found that the main reason for the stagnation of the movement was that the Federation of Industry and Commerce had not promptly inspected and promoted the movement for increased production and donations. As a result, some industrialists and businessmen who had been active in the early stages of the movement gradually slackened their enthusiasm due to the lack of continuous encouragement and assistance; another part of industrialists and businessmen did not yet understand the significance of the three major appeals of the General Association for Resistance Against America and Aid Korea, and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, in view of these shortcomings, held a representative meeting of the business community with preparation and vigorously carried out mobilization and organization work. In this way, the enthusiasm of the city's industrialists and businessmen for increasing production and donations was greatly increased. The original plan to donate two fighter planes was changed to guaranteeing the donation of three fighter planes and striving to donate four; on August 31, 7,000 people from 83 industries across the city held a grand parade to pay their donations collectively, and paid more than 820 million yuan on that day; 15 industries and more than 100 industrial and commercial households in the city began planned management, initially setting off a upsurge of increased production and donations.

The experience gained by the Zhengzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce is very good and worthy of learning from all regions. When carrying out their work, the Zhengzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce did not adopt the method of simply urging or relying on administrative orders. Instead, they first obtained the guidance and assistance of the leading organs, organized a large number of cadres to conduct in-depth publicity and investigation, and helped industrialists and businessmen formulate plans for increasing production and donations; then, at the representative meeting of the business community, they made a report on everyone's thoughts, corrected the incorrect understanding of some industrialists and businessmen, pointed out the favorable conditions for the improvement of business in the second half of the year, introduced the typical experience of increasing production and donations, and mobilized industrialists and businessmen to revise patriotic covenants and formulate plans for increasing production and donations. Finally, a special committee was established to inspect and promote the work of increasing production and donations. Local Federations of Industry and Commerce should absorb the experience of Zhengzhou City, conduct an inspection of the donation movement (first of all, the leadership should be inspected), and continue to promote this movement. In particular, areas where the donation movement has become slack should pay attention to correcting it in time.

    郑州工商联推动增产捐献的经验是正确的
    郑州市工商界的捐献运动在七月份到八月初曾一度停滞。八月上旬市工商联作了检查，发现运动停滞的主要原因是工商联没有及时地检查推动增产捐献运动。结果，使一些在运动初期表现积极的工商业者，因缺乏继续不断的鼓励与帮助，情绪逐渐松懈；另一部分工商业者还不了解抗美援朝总会三大号召的意义，抱着观望等待的态度。工商联在人民政府领导下针对这些缺点，有准备地召开了工商界代表会议，并大力进行动员组织工作。这样，全市工商业者增产捐献的热情大大提高，将原来献战斗机两架的计划，改为保证献战斗机三架，争取献四架；八月三十一日全市八十三个行业七千人举行了集体缴款的盛大游行，当天就缴款八亿二千余万元；全市有十五个行业和百余工商户开始了计划经营，初步掀起了增产捐献的热潮。
    郑州市工商联所取得的这些经验是很好的，值得各地学习。郑州市工商联进行工作时，他们不是采取简单催促或依靠行政命令的办法，而是首先取得领导机关的指导与帮助，组织大批干部深入进行宣传与调查，并帮助工商业者制订增产捐献计划；然后在工商界代表会议上，针对大家的思想作了报告，纠正了部分工商业者的不正确认识，并指出了下半年业务好转的有利条件、介绍了增产捐献的典型经验，发动工商业者修订爱国公约与订立增产捐献计划。最后并建立了专门委员会来检查、推动增产捐献工作。各地工商联应该吸取郑州市的经验，把捐献运动作一检查（首先要检查领导），继续推进这一运动。特别是捐献运动已发生松懈现象的地区，更应该注意及时纠正。
