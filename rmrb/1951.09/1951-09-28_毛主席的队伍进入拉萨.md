    Chairman Mao's Troops Enter Lhasa
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Shenying

    On September 9th, the warm sun shone on the Lhasa Plain, and the golden roof of the Potala Palace reflected a brilliant light. The vanguard of the People's Liberation Army's troops entering Tibet, having crossed thousands of mountains and rivers, entered Lhasa City, the seat of the Tibetan local government, amidst the cheers of the people on this day.

    When the People's Liberation Army reached the Lhasa River, ten miles from Lhasa City, the people of Lhasa City could not wait to gather in groups at the PLA's tents on the river beach to observe. They carefully observed every move of the commanders and fighters, carefully scrutinizing the "August 1st" insignia on the soldiers' hats, and even curiously watched the soldiers when they ate and washed their faces. They wanted to see what Chairman Mao's troops were really like.

    The Tibetan local government set up a welcome station in the suburbs, erecting huge white tents. Early on the morning of the 9th, dozens of officials, including the Kalon in red and yellow brocade robes, and representatives of the three major monasteries in red clothing, had arrived at the welcome station to greet them. The people of the city flocked to the suburbs like a stream from all directions. People wore white clothing and held colorful umbrellas; the women wore green robes with colorful vests on top and exquisite belts around their waists. It is said that this beautiful clothing was introduced by Princess Wencheng during the Tang Dynasty. The people of Lhasa wore this beautiful clothing to welcome their own army. When the neat and majestic troops entered the city, the officials of the Tibetan local government and the representatives of the three major monasteries immediately presented hadas to Commander Wang Qimei of the People's Liberation Army. The streets were blocked by crowds of people, and the walls of many lush *linka* (parks) were also crowded with thousands of Tibetans in festive attire. It was the season when chrysanthemums were in full bloom in Lhasa, and the city looked particularly beautiful. Countless colorful chrysanthemums were arranged on the top windows of each square flat-roofed house, and countless crowds were squeezed behind the blooming flowers, all vying to watch the procession through the streets, admiring the five-star national flag and the giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu at the front of the procession. They all cheered for Chairman Mao's troops coming to Lhasa.

    As the troops passed through the prosperous Barkhor Street around the city, the soldiers sang "The East is Red," and some people in the crowd along the street joined the soldiers in singing in Tibetan. After the liberation of Qamdo, the people of Lhasa learned this song praising their leader. The Tibetans praised, saying, "We have never seen such a neat, majestic, and disciplined army." They shouted loudly, "Liberation Army Yabao Re!" (Lhasa language for very good).

    Chairman Mao's troops brought infinite joy to the people of Tibet. When the troops passed through the city and settled in the barracks, crowds of people were still squeezed in front of the gate to watch. Until dusk, there were still large groups of people on the streets vying to see the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet posted by the People's Liberation Army.

### 毛主席的队伍进入拉萨

    毛主席的队伍进入拉萨
    新华社记者  赵慎应
    九月九日，暖和的太阳照耀着拉萨平原，布达拉宫上面的金顶，映射出灿烂的光芒。人民解放军入藏部队的先遣部队翻越了千山万水，这一天，在人民的夹道欢迎中，进入了西藏地方政府所在地拉萨城。
    当人民解放军进抵距拉萨城十里的拉萨河边时，拉萨城内的人民都急不可待地成群结队跑到河滩解放军的帐篷前参观。他们认真地观察指挥员和战斗员们的一切举动，仔细端详着战士帽子上的“八一”帽徽，甚至连战士们吃饭洗脸时也都好奇地围着看。他们要看看毛主席的队伍到底是什么样子。
    西藏地方政府在郊区设立了欢迎站，搭起了巨大的白色帐篷。九日清早，穿着红黄色锦袍的噶伦以下几十名官员，以及穿着红色服装的三大喇嘛寺代表已到欢迎站迎候，市内的人民像流水一般从各处拥向城郊。人们都穿上白色服装，打着各色的花伞，妇女们穿上绿袍，袍上面还套上各种彩色的背心，腰中束着精致的带子。这美丽的服装，据说还是唐太宗时文成公主入藏时传来的。拉萨人民就穿起这美丽的服装，来欢迎自己的军队。当整齐雄壮的部队进入城内时，西藏地方政府的官员及三大寺的代表立即向解放军王其梅司令员敬献哈达。大街上被拥挤的人群阻塞了，许多树木茂密的林卡（公园）的园墙上，也已挤着成千的穿着盛装的藏胞。这时正是拉萨菊花盛开的日子，拉萨城显得格外美丽，各家方形平房的顶上窗口，都排着无数的各色菊花，在盛开的花朵后面也挤着无数的人群，他们都争先地望着通过大街的队伍，目不转睛地瞻仰着队伍前面的五星国旗和毛主席、朱总司令的巨像，他们都欢呼着毛主席的队伍来到拉萨。
    当部队通过繁荣的环城巴阁街时，战士们唱起“东方红”的歌子，街旁的人群中有人用藏语与战士们合唱起来。在昌都解放后，拉萨人民就学会了这个歌颂自己领袖的歌子。藏民们都称赞着说：“从来没有见到这样整齐雄壮，纪律严明的队伍。”他们大声的喊“解放军牙堡热”（拉萨语很好的意思）。
    毛主席的队伍给西藏人民带来了无限喜悦，当部队通过市区到兵营住下时，门前还是挤着观看的人群，直到傍晚街头还有大堆的人争着看解放军张贴的和平解放西藏办法的协议。
