    Recently, discussions on how to create images of heroic figures have unfolded in some domestic newspapers and periodicals. The discussions currently underway in Soviet literary and art circles on this matter are of great help to us.
    The Soviet "Literary Gazette" published an article by Ososkov on July 30 entitled "The Image of Bolshevik Leaders," raising the question of how to treat the leaders of the Bolshevik Party in literary works. The author of the article believes that every work should clearly depict vivid and prominent images of Bolshevik leaders, because in the real life of the Soviet people building communism, there is nothing more important than the Leninist-Stalinist Bolshevik leadership. The broad masses of Soviet people love and demand to learn the political leadership style and methods of Party workers in arduous construction. The author mentioned that many writers have correctly portrayed the image of Party leaders in their works. For example, Sholokhov's portrayal of Davydov and Pavlenko's portrayal of Voropaev left a deep impression on readers. Next, the author analyzed works that successfully portrayed the image of Bolshevik leaders: such as Gurbatov's "Donbass," Kapusto's "In the Central Region," and Nikolaeva's "Harvest." However, the author pointed out that not all works have been successful in this regard, and many attempts to portray Party workers in recent literary works have failed. They not only failed to portray the multifaceted and intensive work of Party workers well; instead, they portrayed them in a formulaic, unnatural, and even dry manner. Therefore, it makes people feel that these Party workers cannot influence people's destiny and do not seem like leaders. At the same time, the author believes that for writers, Party workers should be lively, thoughtful, enthusiastic, with joys and sorrows, achievements and mistakes. Ososkov's analysis of this issue is worthy of attention from our literary and art workers.

    苏联文艺界展开讨论如何创造布尔什维克领导者的形象问题
    最近在国内有些报刊上，已展开了如何创造英雄人物形象的讨论。关于这个问题，苏联文艺界正在进行的讨论，对我们有很大帮助。
    苏联“文学报”七月三十日发表了奥梭斯柯夫的“布尔什维克领导者的形象”一文，提出文学作品中如何处理布尔什维克党的领导者的问题。该文作者认为每部作品都应该明确地描写出布尔什维克领导者的生动的突出的形象。因为在苏联人民建设共产主义的现实生活中，再没有比列宁斯大林式的布尔什维克领导更重要的东西。广大的苏联人民都热爱并要求学习党的工作者在艰巨的建设中的政治领导作风和方法。作者谈到许多作家在他们的作品中正确地表现了党的领导者的形象。如萧洛霍夫所写的达维多夫，巴甫连科所写的伏罗帕耶夫，给了读者深刻的印象。接着，作者分析了比较成功地表现布尔什维克领导者形象的作品：如郭尔巴托夫的“顿巴斯”、卡普斯托的“在中央区”、尼科拉耶娃的“收获”。但是作者指出：并不是所有的作品在这方面都获得了成功，近年来的文学作品中很多表现党的工作者的企图都失败了。他们不但没有很好地表现党的工作者的多方面的、紧张的工作；而是公式地、不自然地、甚至枯燥地描写着的。因此，使人觉得这些党的工作者不能够影响人们的命运，不像是领导者。同时，作者认为：对作家来说，党的工作者应当是生气勃勃的、有思想的、热情的、有快乐与忧愁、有成就与错误的人。奥梭斯柯夫对这一问题的分析，是值得我们文艺工作者重视的。
