To the respected Chairman Mao:

We minority nationalities, under the rule of feudal oppression, lived lives like cattle and horses. Especially during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the so-called "Five Races Together" was completely a policy of assimilation, such as forcing us to cut our hair, change our clothes, and in some areas, prohibiting us from speaking our own languages. This was simply to exterminate our races. In order to consolidate the "Jiang" family dynasty's position and the wealth of a few large families, they carried out anti-people and counter-revolutionary suppression, constantly conscripting soldiers, dispatching civilian laborers, and extorting all kinds of exorbitant taxes, which was especially severe for us minority nationalities. We struggled on the brink of death, toiling all year round, unable to get enough to eat and wear!

Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have finally seen the light of day and been freed from shackles and chains. Brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups have shown unprecedented solidarity, unity, mutual assistance, and fraternity. Moreover, the government gives us minority nationalities special care and consideration. Our representatives participate in all national meetings and policy measures, and our opinions are used to solve problems. In the past, some of our compatriots in certain areas could not afford clothes to wear, and "eating salt was like celebrating the New Year." Occasionally, when we went to the city to do business, we would be discriminated against by the Han compatriots, who would cheat us by using large scales and small measures. Now, the Communist Party has come, and trade teams transport salt and all necessities deep into the countryside to facilitate us, and at the same time, they help us sell our local products, and use uniform standard scales and measures, without deceiving the old and the young, and mostly adopt a method of not making a profit or even losing money for us. Our lives have been initially improved.

Chairman Mao, you are like the sun, shining on the earth, making everyone feel warm. We sincerely and supremely thank you for your kindness and guarantee to hold the meeting well, accept the tasks given by the conference, and return to our hometowns to earnestly do a good job in trade, and convey to the broad masses to work hard to increase production and resolutely support the front lines.

Chairman Mao, we will forever march forward under your banner! On the occasion of the grand opening of the unprecedented National Ethnic Trade Conference, we, the representatives, especially extend our highest respects and heartfelt greetings to you.

We wish you good health!

    西南区出席全国民族贸易会议代表团向毛主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    我们少数民族，在封建压迫的统治下，度着牛马的生活，尤其在国民党反动派统治期间，所谓的“五族共和”，完全是一种同化政策，如像逼迫我们剪发、改装及有些地区禁止说本族语言等类的事，这简直是要灭亡我们的种族。它为了要巩固“蒋”家皇朝的禄位及几大家族的发财，进行反人民反革命的镇压，不断的拉壮丁、派民伕及一切苛捐杂税的勒索，对我们少数民族格外厉害，我们在这恶劣的死亡线上挣扎，终年劳苦，不得温饱！
    现在，我们在共产党的领导下，才得看见天日，解除了枷锁铁链，各兄弟民族表现了空前的巩固团结、互助友爱，并且政府对我们少数民族，特别优待照顾，国家一切会议及政策措施，都有我们各族的代表参加，依我们的意见来解决问题。过去，我们有些地区的同胞，衣服穿不上，“吃盐当过年”，偶到城里做生意，就要遭受大汉族同胞的歧视呼一吓二的用大秤小斗进行剥削；如今，共产党来了，有贸易小组运盐及一切必需品深入农村方便我们，同时又帮我们推销土产，并且使用一律标准的秤斗，老少无欺，对我们多半采取不赚钱或者赔本的办法。我们的生活，已得到了初步的改善。
    毛主席，你好比太阳，普照着大地，使我们每一个人的身上都感到温暖。我们至诚无上的感谢你的恩情，保证开好会议，接受大会给予的任务，各回到自己的家乡，认真搞好贸易工作，并转达广大的群众努力增加生产、坚决支援前线。
    毛主席，我们永远在你的旗帜下迈步前进！欣逢空前的全国民族贸易会议隆重开幕的今天，我们几个代表特向你致以崇高的敬礼和衷心的慰问。
    敬祝你的身体健康！
