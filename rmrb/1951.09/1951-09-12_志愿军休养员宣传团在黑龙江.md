    Volunteer Army Recuperating Soldiers Propaganda Team in Heilongjiang
    Zhang Hengxuan
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association organized a propaganda team of forty-one Volunteer Army recuperating soldiers, who went to various cities, counties, towns, and some rural areas to give reports to more than 693,000 people and held discussions with more than 153,000 people. These brave warriors, who were gloriously wounded or became ill in order to defend the people of the motherland and world peace, took on the task of conducting propaganda to the people of the motherland during their recuperation. Their selfless patriotism has further deepened the love of the people of the province for the Volunteer Army. Wherever the recuperating soldiers went, they were warmly welcomed by the local people. Thousands upon thousands of people braved the scorching sun and heavy rain to welcome or send them off from afar. When the recuperating soldiers arrived in Tai'an, the welcomers waited for them in the dark, drenched in rain. In Heihe, a border town in northern China, more than 2,000 people held high red flags to welcome the recuperating soldiers, and slogans such as "Welcome our most beloved people" and music resounded together. Many farmers in Suileng County traveled more than thirty miles to listen to the reports of the recuperating soldiers.
    In towns and villages, in crowded halls or sun-drenched squares, as long as the recuperating soldiers were present to speak, the masses listened attentively until the end of the report and were reluctant to leave. Children walking on the streets would salute the recuperating soldiers when they met them. An old man with impaired vision in Haibei Town groped his way to the residence of the recuperating soldiers, wanting to "touch the comrades with his own hands to see if their bodies were strong." People from all over presented flags and gifts to the Volunteer Army. In one month, the recuperating soldiers' propaganda team received more than 230 pennants, more than 6,400 letters of慰问, and more than 14,000慰问 items and large amounts of慰问 money.
    The reports made by the recuperating soldiers of the propaganda team based on their personal experiences moved all the listeners. Cadres in Keshan County, after hearing the recuperating soldiers say: "In the battles between the Volunteer Army and the enemy, whenever the battle was at its fiercest and most brutal, the soldiers would shout: Comrades, look back! Behind us is the motherland! We must fight to the end to defend the motherland and the people of the motherland!" The Volunteer Army's high degree of patriotism inspired them. After returning to their offices, they put forward the slogan "Look Forward," determined to learn from the Volunteer Army and overcome all difficulties in their work. On the same day that employees of six factories in Zhaozhou heard the report, they went back to hold meetings to review their work, examine their shortcomings, and revise their patriotic pledges. The business community in Zhaozhou wrote to the Volunteer Army saying: We will definitely support you with our donations and ensure that the "Zhaozhou" fighter plane takes off as soon as possible by paying our donations in full by the end of September. After listening to the reports, many people asked to increase the amount of their donations; many areas immediately inspected and improved the work of preferential treatment. Wang Weixin, the village head of Northeast Village in the Seventh District of Zhaoyuan, said: "I didn't do a good job of代耕 work, and the more I listened to the report, the sadder I felt." After returning to the village, he immediately launched an inspection of the 代耕 work.
    The recuperating soldiers demonstrated an extremely serious and responsible spirit in their work. Before their departure, they first conducted seven days of study, researched the characteristics of the work in the province and the ideological situation of the masses, repeatedly studied "what to talk about" and "how to talk about it," and wrote out speaking outlines and carefully organized the speaking materials. Then, they conducted two days of collective trial lectures before being divided into groups to work in various places. In their work, they paid attention to listening to the opinions of local leading organs and the masses, and held review meetings after each report to study and improve their work. They engaged in propaganda work with the spirit of combat, overcame various difficulties, and completed the propaganda task.
    The Resist America, Aid Korea Association at all levels in Heilongjiang Province also attached great importance to the work of the recuperating soldiers propaganda team. The province and various cities and counties formulated detailed and meticulous plans. In advance, the main points of propaganda, the methods of organizing and mobilizing the audience, as well as the time, place, and number of participants in the report meetings were all prepared according to the plan. The responsible comrades of the Heilongjiang Provincial Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association personally guided the work of the propaganda team, and sent eleven cadres to assist the eleven groups of the propaganda team to report to various places. Leading cadres of various cities and counties personally led the masses to welcome and send off the propaganda team and presided over the meetings. In their work, they also provided the propaganda team with information at any time, so that they could carry out propaganda focusing on the main issues in the thinking of the masses at that time and place, so that the work of the propaganda team could play a greater role.

    志愿军休养员宣传团在黑龙江
    张恒轩
    黑龙江省抗美援朝分会，组织了四十一名志愿军休养员，成立宣传团，分赴各市县城镇和一部分农村，向六十九万三千多人作了报告，又与十五万三千余人举行了座谈。这些为了保卫祖国人民、为了保卫世界和平而光荣负伤或致病的勇士们，在他们的休养期间，担负起了向祖国人民进行宣传的任务。他们这种忘我的爱国精神，更加深了全省人民对志愿军的热爱。休养员们不论走到什么地方，都受到了当地人民的热烈欢迎。成千成万的群众，冒着烈日、淋着大雨，走出很远来欢迎或欢送他们。休养员到泰安的时候，欢迎者在黑夜里淋着雨等候他们。在祖国北方边疆的黑河，两千多人高举着红旗来欢迎休养员，“欢迎我们最可爱的人”等口号声和乐声响成一片。绥棱县许多农民，走了三十多里地来听休养员的报告。
    在城镇和乡村，在拥挤的厅堂里或炎日晒着的广场上，只要休养员出席讲话，群众都是聚精会神地直到听完报告还依依不散。大街上走的儿童们，一遇到休养员就敬礼。海北镇一位双目失明的老人，摸索着找到休养员的住处，他要“亲手摸摸同志们，看同志们的身体结实不”。各地人民都向志愿军献旗和献礼。一个月中，休养员宣传团收到了锦旗二百三十多面，六千四百多封慰问信，还有一万四千多件慰问物品和大批慰问金。
    宣传团的休养员根据切身经验所作的报告，感动了所有的听众。克山县的机关干部，听到休养员说：“在志愿军和敌人作战中，每当战斗最激烈、最残酷的时候，战士们都高喊着：同志们，回头看看！后面就是祖国啊！我们要为保卫祖国，保卫祖国人民战斗到底！”志愿军这种高度爱国的精神激励了他们。他们回机关后提出了“向前看”的口号，决心向志愿军学习，克服工作中的一切困难。肇州有六个工厂的职工，在听过报告的当天，就回去开会检查了工作，检讨了自己的缺点，修订了爱国公约。肇州工商界向志愿军写信说：我们一定以努力捐献来支援你们，保证在九月底缴清捐款，使“肇州号”战斗机早日起飞。许多群众在听报告后，要求增加自己的捐献数字；许多地区立刻检查、改进了优抚工作。肇源七区东北村村长王维新说：“我没做好代耕工作，越听报告，心越难过。”他回村之后，立即发动了检查代耕的工作。
    休养员们在工作中表现了极度认真负责的精神，他们出发之前，首先进行了七天的学习，研究了全省工作特点和群众的思想情况，反覆学习了“讲什么”和“怎样讲”，并写出讲演提纲，精密组织了讲演材料。而后又进行了两天的集体试讲，才分组到各地去工作。工作中他们注意听取各地领导机关与群众的意见，每次报告之后都举行检讨会，研究改进工作。他们以作战的精神来从事宣传工作，克服了各种困难，完成了宣传任务。
    黑龙江省各级抗美援朝分会，也极为重视休养员宣传团的工作。全省和各市县，分别制订了周密详细的计划。事先把宣传要点，组织动员听众的办法，以及报告会举行的时间、地点、参加人数等，都按计划作了准备。黑龙江省抗美援朝分会负责同志并亲自指导宣传团的工作，又派干部十一人协助宣传团的十一个组到各地去报告。各市、县的领导干部，亲自领导群众欢迎欢送宣传团并主持会议。工作中并随时向宣传团供给情况，使他们能针对当时当地群众思想中的主要问题进行宣传，因而使宣传团的工作能起更大的作用。
