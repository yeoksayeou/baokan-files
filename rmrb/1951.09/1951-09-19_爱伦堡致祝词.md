Ehrenburg's Congratulatory Message

Dear Mr. Soong Ching Ling:

    I am fortunate to have been entrusted with the task of awarding you the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace." Dear Mr. Soong Ching Ling, you have made many contributions to the cause of peace. You have fought tirelessly to make your great motherland—which for a long time was the territory of foreign plunderers—a bastion of freedom and peace in Asia. The path of your life has inspired all honest people, wherever they live. The path of your life can be taken as a noble example. In the years when the forces of darkness were rampant and the cowardly furled their flags or sided with the enemy, you stood up bravely to defend human dignity and the just peace. In the darkest of times, you remained true to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great legacy. You have always been loyal to your people. The losses suffered by China in the struggle for freedom were significant. You, dear friend, have advocated the great cause of healing the wounded, rescuing the dying, and caring for orphans and widows in order to relieve your compatriots. Through years of tireless work, you have helped the Chinese people heal the wounds of war. You have written countless passionate, inspiring, and encouraging articles, and I dare say that in the difficult days of repeated trials, you helped the Chinese people continue to fight and heal the wounds in their hearts.

    The committee representing peace-loving friends from all over the world, while awarding you the highest honor, in addition to your own merits, which cannot be further praised, would like to particularly point out the significant role of your people in the cause of defending peace. The history of China is a great and complex one, in which countless chapters are written in the blood of the people, with many great inventions and the people's sufferings. This nation had long idealized a just world. China's excellent thinkers have opposed tyrannical forces, wars of aggression, and enslavement. More than two thousand years ago, the great poet Qu Yuan shouted out the voice of justice: he cherished freedom and peace and despised the high salaries pursued by court officials. The philosopher Mo Di condemned wars of aggression, pointing out that the victory of the aggressor is the mark of the aggressor's failure. Does it still need to be explained what great world significance the victory of the Chinese people, who finally realized the ideals of their poets and thinkers and defeated foreign aggressors and their lackeys, has? This is the victory of peace, which representatives of seventy countries cheered at the Paris and Warsaw Peace Conferences.

    Now, foreign aggressors are plotting to enslave the hearty and brave Korean people. The sons and daughters of great China—the Volunteers defending the cause of peace—have stepped forward to help the people of this country who are fighting for their independence. Their selfless merits and their sacrifices will surely be recorded in history as examples of brotherly love, courage, and true love of peace.

    As a Soviet writer, I would like to say that I am awarding a medal bearing the image of Stalin to a woman of whom the Chinese people are proud. Let this fact be further proof of the love and deep respect of the Soviet people for the Chinese people! In history, there have been many alliances between countries built on deception, suspicion, and trickery, and these alliances, like marriages for money, cannot withstand the slightest test. But there is another kind of alliance, one that is built on trust, truth, and honesty. Such is the alliance between our two countries. The consolidation and eternal existence of this alliance is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the forces of peace over the forces of war.

    Mr. Soong Ching Ling: I believe that when people learn of your award, not only our two countries but also peace-loving friends all over the world will be delighted. I believe that the men and women who are being enslaved or who are exploring their own paths all over the world, neighboring India and distant Mexico, the men and women of blood-stained Vietnam and truly people's France, will all look at you with admiration. I believe that the mothers and wives of the American soldiers who have been sent by those unconscionable people to conquer Korea, and the ordinary women of America, are watching with longing the strength of China, which is helping to restore peace in Asia, and its peace-loving deeds. I believe that the ordinary people of Japan, after the shameful farce in San Francisco, are also congratulating you—a fighter against Japanese militarists and a friend of Japanese workers, dear Mr. Soong Ching Ling.

    Please allow me to add a few words in a personal capacity: I am honored to be entrusted with the task of awarding you the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace." This gives me the opportunity to see the land that is truly one of the cradles of human civilization, to see the people who are building a new life on this historically rich land under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the most outstanding son of the Chinese people, and this allows me to shake your hand, dear Mr. Soong Ching Ling.

    Please allow me to congratulate you on behalf of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee for Strengthening International Peace, the Soviet Peace Committee, and in my personal capacity: Dear friend, I wish you energy, good health, happiness, and victory over the forces of darkness.

    I am giving you a medal bearing the image of the greatest friend of your motherland, a faithful friend, a staunch friend, the person on whom people on all five continents of the world place their hopes. I know that your life's work is worthy of wearing a medal bearing the image of Stalin.

专栏：

    爱伦堡致祝词亲爱的宋庆龄先生：
    我很幸运地担负起了授给您以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的任务。亲爱的宋庆龄先生，您对和平事业曾有过很多的贡献。为了使您的伟大的祖国——它在很长时期成了外国掠夺者的领地——成为亚洲的自由与和平的堡垒，您曾坚强地战斗不息。您的生活的道路使一切正直的人们——不论他们生活在那里，都得到了鼓舞。您的生活的道路可以奉为崇高的榜样。当着黑暗势力气焰万丈，胆怯者卷起旗帜或投靠敌人的年代里，您曾挺身为保卫人类的尊严，保卫正义的和平而英勇战斗。在最黑暗的年代里，您始终忠实于孙中山先生的伟大遗训。您始终忠实于自己的人民。在争取自由的斗争中，中国所遭受到的损失是重大的。您，亲爱的朋友，为了救济自己的同胞，倡导了救死扶伤，抚育孤儿寡妇的伟大事业。您以多年的不倦的工作，帮助了中国人民医治战争的创伤。您曾写过无数篇充满热情、激励和鼓舞的文章，因此我敢说，在经历多次考验的艰难的日子里，您曾帮助中国人民继续斗争，医治他们的心灵上的创伤。
    代表着世界各国爱好和平的友人们的委员会，在授您以最崇高的褒奖的同时，除了对您本人的，对之不可能再作谀辞的功勋之外，还要特别指出贵国人民在保卫和平事业中的重大作用。中国的历史是一部伟大而又复杂的历史，其中有无数篇章都是用人民的鲜血写成的。其中有许许多多伟大的发明和人民的灾难。这一民族在很久以前就理想过一个正义的世界。中国的优秀的思想家曾经反对残暴势力，侵略战争和奴役。在两千多年以前伟大诗人——屈原就喊出了正义的呼声：他珍重自由与和平，鄙视宫廷显宦所追逐的厚禄。哲学家墨翟谴责侵略战争，他指出：侵略者的胜利正是侵略者失败的标志。终于实现了自己的诗人和思想家们的理想，战胜了外来的侵略者及其走狗的中国人民的胜利具有何等重大的世界意义，这还需要说明吗？这是和平的胜利，七十个国家的代表，在巴黎和华沙和平大会上都欢呼过这一胜利。
    现在，外国的侵略者正在图谋奴役豪爽的、英勇的朝鲜人民。伟大的中国的儿女——保卫和平事业的志愿军挺身而出援助这一正在为自己的独立而战斗的国家的人民。他们的大公无私的功勋，他们的牺牲定将作为兄弟友爱，英勇果敢与真正热爱和平的范例载入史册。
    作为一个苏联作家，我想说，我是在把镌有斯大林像的奖章授给一位使中国人民引以自豪的妇女。让这一事实成为苏联人民对中国人民的热爱与深厚敬意的又一次的证明吧！历史上国与国之间有过不少建筑在欺骗、猜忌、诡计的基础上的同盟，这种同盟与以金钱为目的的结婚一样，是经受不起最起码的考验的。但是有另外一种同盟，这种同盟是建立在信任、真实和诚实的基础上的。我们两个国家的同盟就是这样的。这一同盟的巩固与永恒存在是和平力量战胜战争势力的最可靠的保证。
    宋庆龄先生：我相信，当人们得知您获奖以后，不仅是我们两国而且全世界的和平友人都要欢欣鼓舞的。我相信，全世界正在被奴役的或正在探求自己的道路的男人和女人们，比邻的印度和遥远的墨西哥，染遍鲜血的越南与真正的人民的法国的男人和女人们，都要向您投以钦羡的目光。我相信，被那些丧尽天良的人们派去征服朝鲜的美国兵士的母亲和妻子们，美国的普通的妇女们，都以渴望的心情注视着有助于恢复亚洲和平的中国的力量及其爱好和平的事实。我相信，日本的普通人民，在旧金山的丑剧演出之后，他们也在祝贺您——反对日本军国主义者的战士与日本劳动者的友人，亲爱的宋庆龄先生。
    请容许我以个人的名义补充几句，我以自己能担负起授给您以“加强国际和平”斯大林奖金的任务而感到荣幸。这使我有机会看到了名符其实是人类文明的摇篮之一的土地，看到了在中国人民最优秀的儿子毛泽东的领导下，在历史悠久的土地上建设新的生活的人民，这使我能够和您握手，亲爱的宋庆龄先生。
    请容许我以加强国际和平斯大林国际奖金委员会的名义，以苏联拥护和平委员会并以个人名义向您祝贺：亲爱的朋友，祝您精力充沛，身体健康，精神愉快并战胜黑暗势力。
    我交给您一枚奖章，奖章上镌有您的祖国最伟大的朋友，忠实的朋友，忠实不渝的朋友，全世界五大洲的人们都把希望寄托在这个人的身上，我知道，您的一生事业是值得佩带镌有斯大林像的奖章的。
