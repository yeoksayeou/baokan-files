Latin America Does Not Want War

In the international tense situation where the United States is trying to expand its war of aggression, peace fighters from Latin American countries will hold the American Peace Conference next month to launch a new struggle to strengthen the movement of people in Latin American countries to stop war and defend peace.

The cruel plunder of US imperialism and its agents has caused severe disasters to the people of Latin American countries. Since the United States launched the Korean War, according to official statistics alone: due to rising prices, the cost of living in Brazil has increased by 12 percent, Argentina by 17 percent, Bolivia's cost of living increased by one-third, and Chile by 40 percent. Unemployment is also growing everywhere. Therefore, large-scale strike movements have spread almost throughout Latin America. US imperialism, for the needs of war, is stepping up the plunder of war industrial raw materials from Latin American countries, and is increasingly aggressively demanding cannon fodder from Latin American countries.

US imperialism's attempt to drag Latin American countries into a new war makes the responsibilities of peace fighters in Latin American countries even greater. They must strengthen the struggle against colonialism, war, and poverty, and strive for more people to participate in the struggle to defend peace. This American Peace Conference will surely expand and unite the peace forces of the Latin American people, and make the United States' plan to launch a new war suffer more difficulties.

Big Thieves and Petty Thieves

For the people of West Germany, the American occupiers are a robber who seizes by force. They openly use the "Schuman Plan" and the "Pleven Plan" to incorporate West German armed forces into the "European Army", forcing West Germany's resources and manpower to serve its aggressive plans. At the same time, the American occupiers are also secretly engaging in petty theft, stealing the artistic treasures of the German people.

According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin on September 21, the American authorities are transporting exhibits from the Munich Art Gallery to Salzburg (in Austria), and from there to the United States. The telegram also pointed out that the removal of famous paintings from Munich was carried out without the knowledge of the German people.

People know that a robber who robs in broad daylight disdains to steal chickens and dogs at night. However, the American occupiers in West Germany are both a big thief and a petty thief, which clearly illustrates that the United States today is a mixture of arrogance and meanness in the world.

    拉丁美洲不要战争
    在美国力图扩大侵略战争的国际紧张局势中，拉丁美洲各国的和平战士将于下月举行美洲和平大会，展开新的斗争，以加强拉丁美洲各国人民制止战争、保卫和平运动。
    美帝国主义及其代理人的残酷掠夺，已使拉丁美洲各国人民遭受严重的灾祸。自从美国发动朝鲜战争以来，仅据官方的统计：由于物价的高涨，巴西的生活费用增加了百分之十二，阿根廷增加了百分之十七，玻利维亚的生活费用增加达三分之一，智利达百分之四十。失业现象也到处增长。因此，声势浩大的罢工运动差不多已遍及拉丁美洲。美帝国主义为了战争的需要，正加紧掠夺拉丁美洲各国的战争工业原料，并且越来越凶恶地向拉丁美洲各国索取炮灰。
    美帝国主义力图把拉丁美洲各国拖入新的战争之中，这就使得拉丁美洲各国和平战士的责任更加重大。他们必须加强反对殖民地化、战争与贫困的斗争，并争取更多的人民参加到保卫和平的斗争中来。这次美洲和平大会必将使拉丁美洲人民的和平队伍更加扩大和团结，而使美国发动新战争的计划遭受到更多的困难。
    大盗和小偷
    对于西德人民，美国占领者是一个强取豪夺的大盗，它公开地以“舒曼计划”和将西德武装编入“欧洲军”的“普利文计划”，强使西德的资源和人力，为它的侵略计划服务。同时，美国占领者又在偷偷摸摸地干着小偷行径，窃取了德国人民的艺术宝藏。
    据塔斯社九月二十一日自柏林发出的电讯报道，美国当局正在把慕尼黑艺术陈列馆的展览品运往萨尔斯堡（在奥地利），再从那里把它们运到美国去。在这个电讯中并且指出：运走慕尼黑的名画是瞒着德国人民进行的。
    人们知道，白画抢劫的大盗是不屑于在黑夜偷鸡摸狗的，而美国占领者在西德却既是一个大盗又是一个小偷，这就十分明白地说明了：美国今天在世界上正是这样一个蛮横无理与卑鄙下流的混合物。
