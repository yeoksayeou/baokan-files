Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 24th: Czechoslovakia is widely introducing the culture and art of New China. "Daughters of China," the first film exchanged between China and Czechoslovakia, has been screened in major cities across Czechoslovakia since the 21st. The film is dubbed in Czech and has a total of 19 copies. The three cinemas in Prague that are screening the film have been extremely crowded with audiences in recent days. To celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Czechoslovak Oriental Institute and the Czech-Chinese Friendship Association are jointly hosting five consecutive lectures to introduce the construction of New China, Chinese literature, and the writer Lu Xun.

Prior to this, the Oriental Department of the Czech Ministry of Culture and Propaganda held the "Chinese Art" exhibition. The exhibits included ancient Chinese paintings, sculptures, New Year pictures, and oil paintings, which were warmly welcomed by the Czech people. In order to give more people the opportunity to visit, the exhibition was extended by one month. Recently, the gifts given by the Chinese youth delegation to the Czech youth delegation when they participated in the World Youth and Students for Peace Festival in Berlin have also been displayed in the exhibition window in Wenceslas Square, the most bustling area in Prague. Exquisite brocade flags, commemorative badges, vases, and photos of Chinese youth life have attracted many viewers.

    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】捷克斯洛伐克广泛介绍新中国的文化和艺术。中国和捷克斯洛伐克交换的第一部名片“中华女儿”，已于二十一日起在捷全国各大城市放映。这个影片配有捷语对白，共有十九个拷贝。布拉格放映该片的三家电影院连日观众极为拥挤。为了迎接中华人民共和国成立两周年纪念日，捷克斯洛伐克东方学院和捷中友协正在连续主办五次演讲会，介绍新中国建设、中国文学和作家鲁迅。
   在此以前，捷文化与宣传部东方司曾举办了“中国艺术”展览会。展览品包括中国古画、雕刻、年画、油画等，受到捷人民的热烈欢迎。为了让更多的人有机会参观，展览会曾延期一月闭幕。最近我国青年代表团在柏林参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节时送给捷青年代表团的礼物，也已陈列在布拉格最热闹的瓦克拉夫斯基广场的展览窗里。精制的锦旗、纪念章、花瓶和我国青年生活的照片，吸引了许多观众。
