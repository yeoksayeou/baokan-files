Relying on the Working Class to Run the People's Railway Well
— An Introduction to the National Railway Exhibition

Why has the People's Railway been able to recover and develop so rapidly? A concrete and vivid answer can be found at the National Railway Exhibition. This exhibition is located in the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, and is quite large in scale, consisting of six exhibition rooms. These six exhibition rooms contain a total of 600 models and objects, 500 pictures and charts, and more than 1,100 photographs. The content includes: the restoration of the People's Railway since liberation, the main equipment of the People's Railway, the achievements of workers' inventions and creations and the study of advanced Soviet working methods, the heroic deeds of workers in the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the improvement of workers' cultural and welfare life, and newly built routes and new lines under survey. The exhibition everywhere shows the achievements made by all departments of the People's Railway in learning from advanced Soviet experience, and at the same time, the third room - workers' inventions and creations and rationalization proposals - is the prominent center of the entire exhibition. The third room displays the rich wisdom of Chinese railway workers and eloquently illustrates the great achievements that state enterprises have obtained by relying on the working class.

Among the exhibits in the third room, a large number of machines and production tools amazed the audience. These machines or tools were either created and imitated by railway workers themselves, or improved by them. Their common feature is that they improved production efficiency and saved the country a lot of wealth. For example, the screw rolling machine designed and manufactured by Zhao Rongsheng, a worker at the Huangguantun Railway Machinery Factory, saved the country a lot of foreign exchange. Railway machinery factories use many small screws of one to two and a half points. In the past, only Shanghai had screw rolling machines in China, but they were foreign goods and in small quantities, so most of the small screws used by the Northeast Railway Machinery Factory in the past were bought from foreign countries. The screw rolling machine designed by Zhao Rongsheng can produce 44 screws per minute, and the cost is cheaper than buying foreign screws, so with this screw rolling machine, you don't have to buy foreign screws. The rail splitting machine created by Duan Shangjian, director of the scrap material branch of the Harbin Railway Factory, replaced manual operation, increased work efficiency by more than six times, and can save the country more than 22 million yuan per year. In the past, when the branch factory reused scrap rails, it used manpower to split the rail bottom, rail core, and rail top, and then separately pressed them into round iron, flat iron, or angle iron. Using manual splitting, 21 people could only split three tons per day, and the rail core often had waste products. Using a rail splitting machine, 18 people can split 18 tons per day. The rail splitting machine not only mechanized this heavy manual operation, but also directly rolled the split steel into round iron, flat iron, angle iron and other materials, and eliminated waste products. Sun Lianwang of Tangshan Railway Factory transformed the heavy oil copper furnace, which increased the daily copper melting volume by 60%, while the oil consumption for melting one ton of copper was reduced by 42%, which can save the country 130 million yuan a year. In the past, the copper water melted from this copper furnace was not clear, and the finished product had many pinholes and was fuel intensive. Sun Lianwang, who operated the furnace, found that this was due to insufficient furnace temperature. He suggested to the administration to increase the refractory bricks in the furnace from 3.5 inches to 7.5 inches, and to expand the diameter of the fire hole in the furnace chamber from 2 inches to 4 inches. As a result, not only did the furnace temperature increase and the copper water became clear, and the pinholes in the finished product were greatly reduced, but also the output was greatly increased. In this exhibition room, other amazing things are the exhibits about railway workers improving work methods and improving work efficiency. For example, Northeast Railway loading and unloading workers improved the method of loading cars, adding wooden fences and pillars to the freight cars, and helping cargo owners improve cargo packaging and loading methods, so that the cargo loading volume of the vehicles was greatly increased. For example, when loading bean cakes, a train car could only load 9 tons in the past, but now it can load 25 tons. In the past five months, the average cargo loading volume of Northeast Railway vehicles has increased by 22.6%. This can increase national income by about 10.5 billion yuan per year. In this exhibition room, another eye-catching thing is the exhibit on railway workers improving labor organization, thereby increasing work efficiency. For example, the Gaozi work area of the Nanjing Engineering Section of the Shanghai Railway Administration used to have workers who did not divide their work and did whatever they saw, so the efficiency was very low. This year, worker Wang Shuangqing took the lead in learning the Soviet Nefedov track maintenance method, changed the labor organization, and divided all work into several steps: investigation, preparation, basic work, and finishing work. In the basic work, all manpower was divided into eleven groups according to their respective specialties, so that everyone could be specialized, and work efficiency was greatly improved. In the past, it took a person in this work area 75 minutes to replace a sleeper, but now it only takes 40 minutes; it took a person 107 minutes to replace a rail in the past, but now it only takes 58 minutes. In the past, the entire line was repaired twice a year, and the quality was not good. Now, because the work is done thoroughly, it only needs to be repaired once, which can save 1,600 man-days per year.

There is a corner in this exhibition room that is worth a special mention. There are some locomotive parts on display there. These parts are made of ferrous metal, which does not look beautiful, but they especially attract the appreciation of visiting experts and technicians. Because these parts used to be made of non-ferrous metals, which were very expensive. This year, the Ministry of Railways issued a call, requesting all factories to find ways to manufacture them with ferrous metals, in order to save the country's scarce non-ferrous metal resources. Now, railway machinery factories in Harbin, Changxindian, and other places have initially successfully trial-produced them. Changxindian has used ferrous metals to make 43 kinds of parts, which can save 300 million yuan in costs per year. Harbin Machinery Factory has also made 17 kinds of parts, which can save 18.52 million yuan per year.

In the past two years, the People's Railway has achieved great achievements by relying on the working class, and the living welfare of the broad masses of railway workers has also been improved with the restoration and development of the People's Railway. The statistics charts of the exhibition show that throughout the country, the railway department has established 1,013 workers' cultural palaces or clubs and 813 libraries. This summer, in three months, the national railway department screened nearly 2,000 movies and performed 3,350 dramas. From August last year to April this year, 31,000 people in six bureaus and eleven factories within the customs enjoyed maternity subsidies, and more than 3,000 elderly workers enjoyed old-age subsidies. Thirty-seven sanatoriums and rest homes have been established in the national railway department. The Xingcheng Sanatorium alone has treated more than 1,000 patients, and the number of medical personnel throughout the railway has increased by 54%.

The most exciting last exhibition room vividly shows the audience the new construction of the People's Railway and the beautiful prospects for the future railway construction of New China. Here, several large models show that the construction of the three new lines of Chengdu-Chongqing, Tianshui-Lanzhou, and Laiwu-Zhenjiang is progressing in dangerous terrain. Here, neon lights appear on a large map as two long yellow lines. These two yellow lines, like two giant crawling insects, one from Baichengzi on the Northeast Siping-Taonan line through Inner Mongolia extending to Lanzhou in the Northwest, and the other from Yumen in the Northwest via Lanzhou southward through Guizhou and turning to Hunan and connecting to the Hunan-Guizhou Railway. These two large crawling insects are the seven new lines that have been surveyed and are under survey, with a total length of 5,173 kilometers. These new lines will carry the hopes of the people, and in the near future, will open up the rich Northwest and Southwest, and connect the country's railways into a large arterial network connecting the East, West, North, and South.

    依靠工人阶级，办好人民铁路
    ——全国铁路展览会介绍
    人民铁路为什么能够飞快地恢复发展？这可以从全国铁路展览会得到具体而生动的解答。这个展览会设在北京市劳动人民文化宫，规模相当宏大，由六个展览室构成。在这六个展览室中一共展览着模型实物六百件，图画、图表五百件，和照片一千一百多件。内容包括：解放以来人民铁路修复情况，人民铁路主要设备，职工的发明创造和学习苏联先进工作方法的成效，职工在抗美援朝中的英勇斗争事迹，职工文化福利生活的改善情况，新建路线和正在勘测中的新线。展览会到处都显示出人民铁路各部门在学习苏联先进经验上所获得的成绩，同时以第三室——职工的发明创造和合理化建议为整个展览会中突出的中心。第三室显示着中国铁路工人的丰富智慧，并雄辩地说明国家企业依靠工人阶级所获得的巨大成果。
    在第三室里的展览品中，大量的机器和生产工具使观众赞叹不已。这些机器或工具不是由铁路职工自己创制、仿制出来的，就是经过他们改进过的。它们的共同特点就是提高了生产效率，为国家节省了大量财富。如由皇姑屯铁路机厂工人赵荣生设计制成的搓螺丝机，为国家节省了大量的外汇。铁路机厂用一分到两分半的小螺丝很多，过去国内只上海有搓螺丝机，但是外国货而且数量很少，所以东北铁路机厂过去用小螺丝大部是买外国货。赵荣生设计的搓螺丝机每分钟能生产四十四个螺丝，成本比买外国螺丝便宜，所以有了这个搓螺丝机就可以不买外国螺丝了。哈尔滨铁路工厂利材分厂厂长段尚俭创制的钢轨劈裂机，代替了手工操作，使工作效率提高了六倍多，每年可以为国家节省两千二百多万元。过去该分厂改用废钢轨时是用人力把钢轨的轨底轨心和轨顶劈开，然后再分别压成圆铁、扁铁或角形铁。这样用手工劈，每天二十一个人只能劈三吨，轨心还常有废品。使用钢轨劈裂机每天十八个人就能劈十八吨。钢轨劈裂机不只把这一笨重的手工操作机械化了，并且又能直接把劈开的钢材压延成圆铁、扁铁、角铁等材料，还消灭了废品。唐山铁路工厂孙连旺改造的重油化铜炉，使每天熔铜量提高百分之六十，而化一吨铜的用油量却减少百分之四十二，一年可以为国家节省一亿三千万元。这台化铜炉过去化出的铜水不清，成品砂眼很多，而且费油。操作该炉的孙连旺研究出这是由于炉温不够的原故。他就建议行政把炉内的耐火砖由三点五吋加高到七点五吋，把炉膛的过火孔直径由二吋扩大到四吋。结果不仅炉温提高铜水清了，成品的砂眼大为减少，而且产量也大为提高。在这个展览室里，另一些使人惊讶的东西，是关于铁路职工改进工作方法，提高工作效率的展览品。如东北铁路装卸工人改进了装车的方法，在货车上加木栏，加立柱，并帮助货主改善货物捆包和装车方法，使车辆的装货量大为增加。如装豆饼，过去一个车皮只能装九吨，现在能装二十五吨。五个月来，东北铁路车辆的货物装载量平均提高了百分之二十二点六。每年可以为国家增加收入约一百零五亿元。在这个展览室里引人注目的又一些东西，是铁路职工改进劳动组织因而使工作效率提高的展览品。如上海铁路管理局南京工务段高资工区，过去工人不分工，见活就作，所以效率很低。今年由工人王双庆带头学习了苏联的聂菲铎夫养路法，改变了劳动组织，把所有工作分为调查、准备、基本工作、整理工作几个步骤，在基本工作中把所有人力按各人的特长分为十一个小组，使所有的人都能专业化，工作效率即大大提高。过去该工区一个人换一根枕木需要七十五分钟，现在只要四十分钟；一个人换一根钢轨过去要一○七分钟，现在只要五十八分钟。以往每年全部线路修两遍，质量还不好，现在因为工作做得彻底，只要修一遍，每年可以节省人工一千六百个。
    在这个展览室有一角落是值得特书一笔的。那里陈设着一些机车零件。这些零件是用黑色金属制成的，看起来并不漂亮，但它们特别引起参观的专家和技术人员的欣赏。因为这些零件过去都是需用有色金属制造的，价值很贵。今年铁道部曾提出号召，要求各厂设法用黑色金属来制造，以节省国家稀有的有色金属的富源。现在哈尔滨、长辛店等铁路机厂都已初步试制成功。长辛店已用黑色金属制成四十三种零件，一年可以节省成本三亿元。哈尔滨机厂也制成十七种零件，一年可节省一千八百五十二万元。
    两年来人民铁路依靠工人阶级取得了巨大的成就，而广大铁路职工的生活福利也随着人民铁路的恢复发展而得到了改善。展览会的统计图表说明：在全国范围内，铁路部门已建立了一千零十三处职工文化宫或俱乐部，八百十三处图书馆。今年夏季三个月全国铁路部门共放映了将近两千次电影和演出了三千三百五十次戏剧。从去年八月到今年四月，关内六局十一厂，有三万一千多人享受了生育补助金的待遇，三千多老年工人享受着养老补助金的待遇。在全国铁路部门已经设立了三十七处疗养所和休养所，仅仅兴城疗养所一处已经治疗了一千多患者，全路医疗人员则增加了百分之五十四。
    最使人兴奋的最后一个展览室，生动地向观众展示着人民铁路的新建设，和未来新中国铁路建设的美丽远景。在这里，几个大模型表明成渝、天兰、来镇三新建线路的工程正在险恶的地形中进展。在这里，霓虹灯从一张大地图上现出两条黄色的长线，这两条黄线，像两条巨长的爬虫，一条从东北四洮线上的白城子经过内蒙延伸到西北的兰州，另一条从西北的玉门经兰州向南经贵州而转至湖南和湘黔路衔接。这两条大爬虫就是已经勘测和正在勘测的共长五千一百七十三公里的七条新线。这些新线将带着人民的希望，在不久的未来，开拓富饶的大西北和大西南，并把祖国的铁路线联结成为一个沟通东西南北的大动脉网。（新华社）
