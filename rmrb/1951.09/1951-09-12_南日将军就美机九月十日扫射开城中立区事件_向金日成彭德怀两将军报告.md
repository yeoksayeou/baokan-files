Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 11th: General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation, has submitted the following report to Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai regarding the incident of United Nations Command aircraft strafing the Kaesong Neutral Zone on September 10th:

    At 1:35 PM on September 10th, a United Nations Command military aircraft once again intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone and carried out machine gun strafing, hitting residences of local residents in the Manyue-ri area near the conference site. Forty-two bullet marks have been found, of which fourteen hit houses, landed outside or inside walls, thirteen on the road, and fifteen in vegetable gardens. More than ten machine gun bullets and casings were found near the bullet marks. More than ten machine gun casings were also found near Songgyungwan, north of Kaesong. The details of the investigation are reported in sections as follows:

    (1) Within one hour of the incident, our liaison officer began notifying the other side via radio telephone at 2:25 PM and, on behalf of our chief delegate, lodged a verbal protest with the other side. However, due to a malfunction in the other side's radio, communication was not completed until 3:27 PM. At 6:30 AM, the other side agreed via radio telephone to meet with our liaison officer at Panmunjom at 9:00 AM for a joint on-site investigation. At 9:00 AM sharp, the other side's investigation personnel arrived at Panmunjom, where they were guided by our translator to meet with our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen. The other side's investigation personnel, led by Colonel Daley, proceeded to the scene of the incident, Manyue-ri, after initial discussions to begin the on-site investigation.

    (2) The liaison officers of both sides first investigated near and inside two houses at 336-5 Manyue-ri and 309 Manyue-ri, which were struck by aircraft machine gun fire, and successively examined more than twenty bullet marks and checked the bullets and casings near the bullet marks. All the bullet marks on the walls, piercing the houses, and landing on the road and in the vegetable gardens, showed that they were the result of aircraft strafing several hours earlier. During the on-site investigation, the other side repeatedly sought various excuses to deny the responsibility they could not escape. When starting to investigate a bullet impact inside a house, Colonel Daley claimed that the bullet impact inside the house might have been the result of someone firing a machine gun from the roof. The other side's personnel climbed onto the roof and claimed that there was a crack in one of the roof tiles. Our liaison officer pointed out that the wide range of bullet marks clearly could not have been caused by machine gun fire from the roof, and that the crack on the roof was obviously the result of aircraft machine gun fire. Colonel Daley also believed that individual bullet marks penetrating the house did not clearly indicate the direction of the shooting, and claimed that the shooting directions of the bullets were not the same. Our liaison officer pointed out that the shooting directions indicated by all the bullet marks were generally consistent, and that individual bullet marks penetrating the house with less clear direction were obviously caused by hitting hard walls, causing the direction to change. Colonel Daley then claimed that the shooting angles displayed by the bullet marks were all around 30 to 40 degrees, and that the angle of aircraft strafing was unlikely to be so small. Our liaison officer immediately pointed out that aircraft strafing could very well create angles of 30 to 40 degrees, and that there was no reason to say that aircraft strafing could not create angles of 30 to 40 degrees, and that the generally consistent angles displayed by all bullet marks further showed that the strafing came from the same aircraft. When examining bullet marks on the wall, Colonel Daley found some old rifle shooting marks and claimed that the machine gun bullet marks may also have been caused by rifle shooting. Our side immediately pointed out that there were rifle marks everywhere in Kaesong, and that it could not be inferred from this that the aircraft machine gun bullet marks were also caused by rifle shooting. When examining bullet marks in the vegetable garden, initially, because the soil was loose and the bullet penetration was deep, the bullets in the bullet marks could not be found immediately. Colonel Daley even claimed that other bullets may have been placed on the ground and that the bullets must be dug out from under the ground to prove that the bullets were fired by aircraft machine guns. However, when a bullet was dug out from under another bullet mark, Colonel Daley claimed that he did not personally see the bullet being dug out from the ground. When our liaison officer proposed digging out other bullet marks, Colonel Daley said it was not necessary. Finally, Colonel Daley claimed that although all the evidence may have been caused by aircraft strafing, it could not prove that it was a United Nations Command aircraft; and said, "Unless I was personally here at the time, I have no way to be sure." Our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, pointed out: "In this case, the only way is that you fell from the plane at that time and landed here."

    (3) However, the testimonies of local residents confirmed Colonel Daley's questions, confirming the other party's inescapable responsibility. At Colonel Daley's selection, the liaison officers of both sides successively questioned Choi Ki-jeong and Woo Heung-bok, residents of 336-5 Manyue-ri, and Kim Bok-soon, a resident of 309 Manyue-ri. All three clearly stated that they were awakened by aircraft machine gun strafing at night and clearly heard the sound of the aircraft. Kim Bok-soon said that she had personally seen the firelight when aircraft machine gun fire hit the house. Choi Ki-jeong pointed out that since the Kaesong negotiations began, only US military aircraft had been to Kaesong and had carried out bombing near the conference site. Just as the two sides were conducting an on-site investigation, United Nations Command military aircraft repeatedly intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone. After our liaison officer sternly pointed this out, the other side still denied it. When the first aircraft was seen, it claimed that it was fifteen miles away. When the second aircraft appeared, it claimed that it was six to eight miles away. The third time, when five of the other side's aircraft approached the airspace above the investigation site, they claimed that they were at least five miles away. Our liaison officer pointed out that the last time the aircraft circled in the sky, it was less than five kilometers away from the investigation site. The on-site investigation ended at 1:40 PM. Our liaison officer repeatedly suggested that any local residents could be questioned as much as possible, but the other side said it was no longer necessary. The other party took away three bullets and a bag of black powder from the bullet impact on the wall.

    (4) The meeting resumed at the conference site at 3:00 PM. Our liaison officer took out the aircraft machine gun casings found near Songgyungwan, north of Kaesong, and requested the other side to continue to conduct a joint on-site investigation with our side, but the other side insisted that there was no need for further investigation, only marked the approximate location on the map and took away one casing, with the letters LS43 on the bottom.

    (5) Colonel Daley finally tried to deny the United Nations Command's responsibility for this aircraft strafing, claiming that he was only there to investigate the facts and was unwilling to draw any conclusions, and that conclusions could only be made after analyzing the investigation facts and checking the radar reports. Our liaison officer pointed out that all physical and testimonial evidence had fully proven the fact that the other side's aircraft had intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone and carried out strafing, and declared that, on the order of the chief delegate, a serious verbal protest was first lodged with the other side, and all rights to make demands were reserved. The meeting ended at 3:55 PM.

    (6) The intrusion into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone and the carrying out of machine gun strafing by a United Nations Command military aircraft at 1:35 PM on September 10th was another serious provocative act by the United Nations Command in repeatedly violating the Neutral Zone Agreement. The United Nations Command not only refused to deal with these serious incidents of repeatedly violating the agreement in a responsible manner, but also proposed changing the meeting address on the pretext that Kaesong was within our territory, attempting to escape their responsibility for these serious provocative incidents. On the other hand, they continued to violate the Neutral Zone Agreement and constantly created serious incidents. The other side's serious provocative action on September 10th once again proved that the other side deliberately sabotaged the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement and obstructed the armistice talks, making it impossible for them to resume.

    南日将军就美机九月十日扫射开城中立区事件
    向金日成彭德怀两将军报告
    【新华社开城十一日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军已就联合国军飞机于九月十日扫射开城中立区事件，向金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员提出报告如下：
    九月十日一时三十五分联合国军军用飞机一架，又一次侵入开城中立区上空施行机枪扫射，击中会场附近满月里地方居民的房屋。已发现弹痕四十二处，其中击中房屋、弹落于墙外或屋内者十四处，路上十三处，菜园中十五处，在弹痕附近并发现机枪弹头与弹皮十余枚。另在开城以北成均馆附近发现机枪弹壳十余枚。兹分段报告调查详情如下：
    （一）事件发生后一小时之内，我方联络官即于二时二十五分开始以无线电话通知对方，并代表我方首席代表向对方提出口头抗议，但以对方电机发生故障，直到三时二十七分方始通话完毕。六时三十分对方通过无线电话约定在九时前来板门店与我方联络官会晤，共同进行实地调查。九时正对方调查人员到达板门店，由我方翻译引导至会场与我方联络官张春山上校及柴成文中校会晤。对方调查人员以戴罗上校为首，经过初步的会谈，双方即赴出事地点满月里地方，开始实地调查。
    （二）双方联络官首先在为飞机机枪所击中的满月里三三六番地五号，及满月里三零九番地两所房屋附近及屋内进行调查，先后共查勘弹痕二十余处，并检查了弹痕附近的弹头与弹皮。所有击中墙壁，洞穿房屋以及落于路上和菜园里的弹头、弹皮以及各处的弹痕，都显示是数小时以前飞机扫射的结果。对方在实地调查中，一再寻求各种藉口来抵赖对方所不能逃避的责任。在开始调查一处屋内中弹情况时，戴罗上校声称，屋内中弹处可能是有人在屋顶上以机枪扫射的结果，对方人员并爬上屋顶宣称，屋顶上瓦片有一处裂痕。我方联络官指出各地弹痕范围之广，显然不可能是由屋顶上机枪扫射所造成的，而屋顶上的裂痕更显然是飞机机枪扫射的结果。戴罗上校又认为个别洞穿房屋的弹痕不能明显表明射击的方向，并声称：各个子弹的射击方向并不相同。我方联络官指出：所有弹痕所显示的射击方向大体上均一致，而个别穿透房屋方向不甚明确的弹痕，显然是由于击中坚硬墙壁致使方向有所转折。戴罗上校继又声称，弹痕所显示的射击角度均在三、四十度左右，而飞机扫射角度不大可能如此之小。我方联络官当即指出飞机扫射完全可能造成三、四十度的角度，说飞机的扫射不能造成三、四十度的角度是没有任何理由的，而所有弹痕所显示的角度大体上一致，更显示扫射系出自同一飞机。在检查墙壁上弹痕时，戴罗上校发现有个别陈旧的步枪射击痕迹，声称，机枪弹痕可能也是步枪射击所致。我方当即指出开城到处都有步枪的痕迹，决不能因此而推断飞机机枪弹痕亦属步枪射击所致。在检查菜园中弹痕时，起初因为土松弹深，未能立即发现弹痕中的弹头，戴罗上校竟据此称其他弹头都可能是安置在地面上的，必须从地面下挖出弹头才能证明子弹系由飞机机枪所射击。但当在另一处弹痕下挖出弹头时，戴罗上校却又声称，并未亲眼看见弹头系自地下挖出。当我方联络官提出另挖弹痕时，戴罗上校却又表示并无必要。最后戴罗上校声称，一切证据虽然可能是由飞机扫射所致，但不能证明是联合国军的飞机；并称“除非我当时亲自在这里，否则我没有方法可以确定”。我方联络官张春山上校指出：“在这种情况下，唯一的办法是当时你从飞机上掉了下来，落在此地”。
    （三）但是当地居民的作证，都肯定地答覆了戴罗上校，确定了对方无可逃避的责任。在戴罗上校的选择下，双方联络官曾先后询问了满月里三三六番地五号居民崔基鼎与禹兴福及满月里三零九番地的居民金福顺，三人都明确声称在夜间为飞机机枪扫射所惊醒，并清楚听见飞机声。金福顺称她曾亲眼看见飞机机枪击中房屋时所发生的火光。崔基鼎并指出自从开城谈判会议以来，只有美军方面的飞机到过开城，并曾在会场附近施行轰炸。正当双方进行实地调查时，联合国军军用飞机又一再侵入开城中立区上空，经我方联络官严词指出后，对方仍矢口抵赖。第一次看见有飞机时声称相隔有十五英里。第二次飞机出现时，称相隔六至八英里。第三次当对方飞机五架逼近调查地点上空时，声称相隔至少五英里。我方联络官指出最后一次飞机在上空盘旋时，距离调查地点上空连五公里也不到。实地调查在下午一时四十分结束。我方联络官一再提出可以尽量询问任何当地居民，但对方声称已无必要。对方取去弹头三枚，墙上中弹处黑粉一包。
    （四）下午三时在会场复会。我方联络官取出在开城以北成均馆附近所发现的飞机机枪弹壳，要求对方继续与我方进行共同实地调查，但对方坚持已无继续调查的必要，仅在地图上划明大概位置并取去弹壳一枚，弹壳底面有LS43的字样。
    （五）戴罗上校最后依然企图抵赖联合国军方面对于此次飞机扫射的责任，声称此来仅在调查事实，不愿作任何结论，并称必须在分析调查事实，并查考雷达报告后才能作出结论。我方联络官指出所有物证和人证都已经充分证明对方飞机侵入开城中立区上空施行扫射的事实，并声明奉首席代表之命，向对方先行口头提出严重抗议，并保留一切要求的权利。会议在下午三时五十五分结束。
    （六）九月十日一时三十五分联合国军军用飞机侵入开城中立区上空，施行机枪扫射是联合国军方面一再破坏中立区协议中的又一次严重挑衅行动。联合国军方面不但对于他们一再破坏协议的严重事件拒绝予以认真负责的处理，反而一方面藉口开城是在我方阵地之内的事实，提议更换开会地址，企图逃脱他们对于这些严重挑衅事件的责任。而另一方面继续破坏中立区协议，不断制造严重事件。九月十日对方再次的严重挑衅行动，又一次证明对方蓄意破坏开城中立区协议，并阻挠停战会议使之无法恢复。
