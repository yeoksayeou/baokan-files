Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th - According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency on the 23rd, the morale of officers and soldiers of the so-called United Nations forces is declining daily, due to the protracted negotiations in Kaesong and the bleak prospects for the war.

The report stated that recently, on the Eastern Front, a company commander of the 2nd Battalion, 38th Regiment, 2nd Division of the U.S. Eighth Army led forty American officers and soldiers to surrender. They all said that they surrendered because they saw no hope for an end to the Korean War, and the protracted negotiations in Kaesong only strengthened their long-brewing determination to surrender.

The platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon of F Company said that he and his friends decided to surrender because he felt that death was imminent every day, and it would be a meaningless and shameful death. When they heard that the U.S. government was using the Kaesong negotiations as a delaying tactic to prepare for a new offensive, he decided to surrender without hesitation.

The prisoner of war said that he was sincerely grateful for the care provided to prisoners of war by the North Korean authorities. He also wanted to tell his relatives, friends, and compatriots in Pomona, California, that he hoped they would not follow in his footsteps and come to Korea. He said that in any case, their situation in Korea was hopeless.

    侵朝战争前途黯淡
    美军一批集体投降
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜中央通讯社二十三日报道：所谓联合国部队的军官与士兵的士气已日趋消沉，这是由于开城谈判的拖延不决和战争前途的黯淡。
    报道称，不久以前在东线上，曾有美军第八军第二师第三十八团第二营的某连长率领四十个美国官兵投降。他们都说，他们之所以投降，是因为他们看到朝鲜战争没有结束的希望，而开城谈判的拖延不决，也只有加强他们酝酿已久的投降的决心。
    F连第二排排长说，他和他的朋友们决定投降，是因为他每天都觉得死亡就要临头，而且是毫无意义的可耻的死亡。当他们听说美国政府利用开城谈判作为准备新攻势的缓兵之计的时候，他就毫不犹豫地决定投降。
    这个战俘说，他对于北朝鲜当局对于战俘的照顾，表示衷心的感激。他还愿意告诉波摩纳（加利福尼亚）城的他的亲戚朋友与同胞们，希望他们再不要蹈他的覆辙到朝鲜来。他说无论如何，他们在朝鲜的处境是没有希望的。
