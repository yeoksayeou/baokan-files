The Huai River basin has begun its autumn harvest. From eastern Henan and southern Henan to northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, the vast fields are filled with sorghum, cotton, soybeans, and sesame. The sorghum is topped with red and plump ears, and the cotton bolls burst with snow-white blossoms. Now, the farmers in the Huai River basin are busy cutting down the sorghum and picking cotton.

The farmers in the Huai River basin are overjoyed with the bumper harvest, like the blooming cotton bolls. Farmers in low-lying areas that were flooded year after year are telling everyone they meet, "This year's crops are good." For many years, many farmers in the Huai River basin plowed and planted every spring, and the land was equally fertile, but they often could not wait for the crops to mature, and could not wait for the autumn harvest after sowing the seeds into the soil. A flood or a heavy rain would wipe out a year's hard work. Now, in the mature crop fields, farmers are dancing lightly with sickles; groups of women picking cotton are singing and chatting.

This summer, farmers on the Huai River Plain have already harvested a good crop of wheat. The average yield of wheat in eastern and southern Henan was 27 jin per mu more than last year. In Yancheng, Wuyang, Xihua, Shangshui, Suiping, Shangcai, Xincai, Luoshan and other counties, which used to suffer from the flooding of the Huai River and its tributaries, the total wheat output last year was only 362 million jin, but this year it is 714 million jin. In the old Wangpo, Wu Songhu and other low-lying areas that have been flooded for years, the yield of wheat this year is as high as 300 jin per mu. The same is true in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu: Fuyang Prefecture in northern Anhui harvested about 1 billion jin of wheat this year, and Gaoyou County in northern Jiangsu harvested 200 jin of wheat per mu this year, with a maximum of 400 jin.

Many farmers are now saying that the autumn crops have large ears and full grains, which are the best crops in many years. The sorghum in Fuyang area of northern Anhui yields 150 to 200 jin per mu. It is estimated that the total output of wheat, sorghum, soybeans, sesame, mung beans and other crops in the summer and autumn seasons in the Suxian Prefecture, which suffered the most from floods for years, will be 3 billion jin, more than double that of last year. The cotton in eastern Henan and northern Anhui is generally good this year. The jute in various parts of northern Anhui and the tobacco in Fengyang have good harvests: jute yields 150 to 250 jin per mu, and good yields are 300 jin; the yield of tobacco in Fengyang is almost three times that of last year. As for the rice in Gaoyou County, northern Jiangsu, although the harvest this year is not as good as last year, many low-lying fields that were not planted in the past were planted this year because the Huai River was repaired this year, and the harvest was still good.

One hundred and seventy villages and more than one million mu of fertile land in Suxian, Lingbi, Sixian, and Suixi (newly established county, northwest of Suxian) counties have been flooded and unharvested year after year due to low-lying terrain. This year, the Sui River was dredged, making it easier to drain water, and a bumper harvest was achieved across the board. Eight hundred thousand mu of low-lying fields in Shouxian and Huoqiu on the south bank of the Huai River were not flooded this year because of the Runheji flood storage project, and they also had a bumper harvest. There are many such places in the Huai River basin, where one season of harvest was not guaranteed in previous years. Taking Yingshang County as an example: Yingshang is located at the confluence of the Ying River and the Huai River. Last year, 1.41 million mu of farmland in 113 villages out of the county's 128 villages and 1.75 million mu of farmland were flooded, and 80% of the population became disaster victims. This year, Yingshang had a bumper harvest in both summer and autumn. Pengji Township in the county has been suffering from floods every year since the Yellow River breached at Huayuankou, and there has not been a good harvest for a year. This spring, a sluice gate was built at the nearby Changlin Lake, making it easier to drain water from the township's farmland. The summer wheat yield was 300 jin per mu. It is estimated that the township will harvest 3.8 million jin of grain more than in normal years in the summer and autumn seasons.

This year is the first year of comprehensively harnessing the Huai River after Chairman Mao put forward the slogan "The Huai River must be harnessed well," and the disastrous years in the Huai River basin are gone forever. This year's bumper harvest is because there were no serious floods in the Huai River basin, the Huai River did not overflow, and the problem of difficult drainage of accumulated water during the rainy season was largely solved. This is of course due to the harnessing of the Huai River, to the construction of flood storage reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River, the solid dikes of the Huai River, the dredging of many tributary channels, and the opening of drainage ditches in the waterlogged depressions.

"Fengyang is a good place," and the Huai River basin was originally a famous "granary" in our country. Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breached the Huayuankou of the Yellow River, this "granary" has been silted up, with accumulated water difficult to drain, resulting in so-called "major disasters in heavy rain, minor disasters in light rain, and droughts without rain." The "granary" has long been unworthy of its name. For many years, farmers have had no confidence in the harvest of seeds sown in the soil. Now, their years of negative emotions towards production have been swept away, and their enthusiasm for production has increased a hundredfold. With the victory of harnessing the Huai River, our country will have a more prosperous "Huai River granary." (Xinhua News Agency)

    第一年治淮工程已有显著功效
    淮河流域今年夏秋两季丰收
    淮河流域已开始秋收。从豫东、豫南到皖北、苏北，辽阔的原野上是一片高粱、棉花、大豆和芝麻。高粱顶着红而肥大的穗子，棉桃盛放朵朵雪白。现在，淮河流域的农民，正在忙于放倒高粱和采摘棉花。
    淮河流域获得丰收的农民心花怒放，像朵朵棉桃的怒放一样。那些连年遭水淹的低洼地区的农民，更是逢人便说：“今年好庄稼。”多年了，淮河流域的许多农民，每年春天一样春耕，一样播种，土地也同样是肥沃的，但是，他们把种子播入土中却往往盼不到庄稼成熟，盼不到秋收，一场大水或一场大雨，一年的辛苦就付之流水了。现在，在成熟的庄稼地里，农民轻快地飞舞着镰刀；成群结队的摘棉花的农妇们有说又有唱。
    今年夏天，淮河平原上的农民已经收了一季好麦子。豫东、豫南的小麦，每亩平均比去年多收二十七斤。往年常遭淮河干河和支河泛滥的郾城、舞阳、西华、商水、遂平、上蔡、新蔡、罗山等县，去年小麦总产量只有三亿六千二百多万斤，今年有七亿一千四百多万斤。连年水淹的老王坡、吴宋湖等低洼地区，今年每亩小麦的产量高到三百斤以上。皖北、苏北也一样：皖北阜阳专区今年收了约十亿斤小麦，苏北高邮县一带，今年小麦每亩收二百斤，最高有收到四百斤的。
    现在的秋庄稼，许多农民又说，穗大籽满，是好些年来没有的好庄稼。皖北阜阳一带的高粱，每亩收一百五到二百多斤。连年水灾最重的宿县专区，今年夏秋两季小麦、高粱、大豆、芝麻、绿豆等作物，据估计能收三十亿斤，比去年多一倍还多。豫东、皖北今年的棉花一般也不错，皖北各地的黄麻和凤阳的菸叶是好收成：黄麻每亩收一百五十斤到二百五十斤，好的收三百斤；凤阳菸叶的收成，差不多是去年的三倍。至于苏北高邮县一带的水稻，虽然今年的收成不如去年，但因今年修了淮河，往年不栽秧的许多低田今年也栽了秧，而且收成还不错。
    宿县、灵璧、泗县、濉溪（新设县，在宿县西北）等县有一百七十个乡一百多万亩良田，只因地势低洼年年被淹年年不收，今年濉河疏浚了，这些地方排水容易，普遍丰收。淮河南岸寿县和霍邱有八十万亩低田，因为今年修了润河集蓄洪工程，没有被淹，也丰收了。这样的地方在淮河流域是很多的，往年是一年一季收成也没有保证的。以颍上县为例：颍上在颍河和淮河会流的地方，全县一百二十八乡一百七十五万亩耕地，去年淹了一百十三乡一百四十一万亩，百分之八十的人口成了灾民。今年，颍上夏秋两季都丰收了。该县彭集乡，自从黄河在花园口决口以来，年年遭水灾，没有一年好收；今年春天，附近的长林湖修了一座水闸，全乡耕地排水容易，夏天的麦子每亩收了三百斤。夏秋两季，估计全乡能比平常年成多收三百八十万斤粮食。
    今年是毛主席提出“一定要把淮河修好”以后，根治淮河的第一年，淮河流域的灾难年月已一去不复返了。今年丰收是因为淮河流域没有发生严重的水灾，淮河没有泛滥，雨季积水难排的问题也大部解决了。这当然要归功于治淮，归功于淮河的上游和中游都修了蓄洪水库，淮河的堤防坚固，许多支流的河道疏通了，而且积水的洼地还开了排水沟。
    “凤阳本是好地方”，淮河流域原是我国著名的“粮仓”。这个“粮仓”自从蒋匪掘开黄河的花园口以来，弄得河道淤塞，积水难排，造成所谓“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾”，“粮仓”早已名不符实了。多年来，农民对播入土中的种子没有收获的信心。现在，他们多年的对生产的消极情绪已一扫而光，生产热情百倍增高。随着治淮胜利，我国将有一个更加富庶的“淮河粮仓”。（新华社）
