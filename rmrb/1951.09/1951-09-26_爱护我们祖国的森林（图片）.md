Binding the ends of railroad ties with wire can prevent them from cracking due to wind and sun exposure. This is a scene of the Sujiatun Anticorrosion Plant in Northeast China binding wood.

Pushing wood into an anticorrosion cylinder and injecting anticorrosion oil under pressure can extend the service life of wood by several to more than ten times. This is a scene of the Hadawan Anticorrosion Plant in Northeast China performing anticorrosion treatment on railroad ties.

Our country's remote areas have many forests, but because of the vastness of our territory, forest area accounts for only five percent of the total land area. Coupled with inappropriate distribution and transportation difficulties, it is far from enough to mitigate natural disasters and supply the needs of national construction. This is a natural forest in Northeast China. If it can be well managed and protected, and rationally harvested and utilized, it will contribute to our country's national basic construction.

The log rafting operations in various forest areas of Northeast China, with the help of Soviet experts, have learned the advanced Soviet experience of "early preparation and early action," breaking away from the past reliance on heaven with the idea of "rafting when the water is good, and waiting when the water is low." This has increased rafting efficiency by more than three times. This is a scene of logs being rafted down the Songhua River to a transfer station and being dragged ashore by horses.

In order to save the country's timber, bamboo heads, reeds, or other fibrous plants should be used as raw materials for papermaking as much as possible. This is a scene of the Zhufuoan Paper Mill in Huoshan, Northern Anhui, soaking bamboo in a pool as a raw material for papermaking.

Burning the surface of electric welding piles for about three minutes (surface carbonization) and then applying tar can extend their service life. This is a scene of the Yiyang Highway Bureau in Hunan Province carrying out electric welding anticorrosion.

At present, many of our country's forests have suffered huge losses due to unfortunate fires. Therefore, universally establishing fire prevention and forest protection organizations and launching mass forest protection movements is the primary and serious task in forest protection work. This is a watchtower established by the Yabuli Lumber Mill in Northeast China, which can detect situations in time and prevent the spread of fire.

Widely establishing and expanding fire-fighting equipment and fire prevention tools in forest areas is a necessary condition for forest protection work. This is fire prevention equipment for forest protection in the Xing'an Mountains Forest Area of Inner Mongolia.

Accepting the advanced Soviet logging experience, implementing lower stump heights and utilizing treetop wood greatly reduces timber losses. In last winter's logging, the stump heights in various forest areas in Northeast China were generally reduced to below 30 centimeters, most forest areas were reduced to 30 centimeters, and a few places were reduced to 10 centimeters (such as the First Operation Section of the Tangyuan County Bureau in Northeast China). This is a scene of workers from the Yichun Forest Administration in Northeast China logging with reduced stump heights.

In timber transportation work, mobilizing tens of thousands of people to go to the mountains is a very complex organizational and mass work. Therefore, strengthening the organization of animal-powered timber transportation is an important key to ensuring the completion of the transportation task. This is a scene of using livestock to transport timber up the mountains in the Nanyi Forest Area of Northeast China.

Using tractors to transport timber instead of cattle and horses is an advanced method of timber transportation, and the timber transportation rate is three times higher than that of animal power. This advanced timber transportation method has now been partially adopted in the forestry industry in Northeast China. This is a scene of tractors transporting timber at the Wumin River site of the Yichun Forest Administration in Northeast China.

Afforestation on barren hills can prevent floods from destroying fields. This is a scene of farmland in Tianshui, Gansu, being submerged by sand and stones washed down by floods due to the lack of forests on the mountains, causing great losses to farmers.

Establishing windbreak forest networks can fundamentally transform natural conditions and eliminate wind and sand disasters. This is a windbreak forest network that has been growing for a short time near Xinle and Xingtang counties in Western Hebei. Because the trees have already played a role in preventing wind and sand, the crops are growing very vigorously.

Reward universal afforestation to eliminate barren mountains, and especially encourage the planting of various fast-growing trees. The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee is working to realize the plan of eliminating barren mountains and greening Hubei in ten years. This is a scene of the Wuchang Forest Farm cultivating a large number of nurseries.

Burning fertilizer with fire near forest areas often causes forest fires, which is the main cause of forest destruction. This is a scene of farmers in a forest area in East China burning fertilizer with fire, affecting the trees.

Grazing livestock near forest areas is also one of the reasons for forest destruction. This is a scene of sheep destroying trees in the Longwang Gully of Longnan, Tianshui, Gansu.

Indiscriminate logging and using logging to solve local financial problems are the greatest harm to the country's timber resources. This is a scene of indiscriminate logging in a forest area in East China.

After the timber is concentrated by locomotives on forest railways, it is promptly supplied to various parts of the country in need. This is a scene of locomotives transporting timber.

    爱护我们祖国的森林
    将枕木的两端用铁丝捆住，可以避免枕木因风吹日晒而开裂。这是东北苏家屯防腐厂进行捆木的情形。
    将木材推进防腐圆筒，加压注入防腐油，可以延长木材使用年限从几倍到十几倍。这是东北哈达湾防腐厂进行枕木防腐的情形。
    我国的僻远地区有着许多森林，但是由于我国国土的辽阔，森林面积仅占国土面积的百分之五，加上分布得不适当和运输的困难，因此远不足以减免天然的灾害和供给国家建设的需要。这是东北的自然林，如果能管理和保护得好，而又能合理的采伐和利用，将有助于我国国家基本建设。
    东北各地林场的流送作业，在苏联专家帮助下，学习了苏联“早准备、早动手”的先进经验，打破了过去“水好则流，水小则等”的靠天思想，这样使得流送效率提高了三倍多。这是经松花江流送到转运站的木材，用马拖上岸的情形。
    为了节省国家木材，应尽量利用竹头、芦苇或其他纤维植物作造纸原料。这是皖北霍山诸佛庵纸场将竹子泡在水池中，作为造纸的原料。
    电焊桩部表面用火烤焦（表面炭化）约三分钟后，加送焦油，可以延长使用年限。这是湖南益阳公路局进行电焊防腐的情形。
    目前我国有不少的森林已因不幸的火灾而造成了巨大的损失。因此普遍建立防火护林的组织和发动群众性的护林运动，是护林工作中的首要和严重的任务。这是东北牙不力制材场设立的瞭望台，可以及时发现情况，防止火势蔓延。
    广泛建立和扩充林区的消防设备、防火工具，是护林工作的必要条件。这是内蒙兴安岭林区护林的防火工具。
    接受苏联采伐的先进经验，实行降低伐根和利用梢头木（树梢上的木头），大大地减少了木材的损失。在去年的冬季的采伐中，东北各林场的伐根普遍降低到三十公分以下，大部林区降低到三十公分，也有少数地方降低到十公分（如东北汤原县局第一作业所）。这是东北伊春森林管理局的工人，降低伐根的采伐情形。
    在木材搬运工作中，动员几万人马上山，是一个非常复杂的组织工作和群众工作。因此，加强畜力运材的组织工作，是保证搬运任务完成的重要关键。这是东北南义林区用牲口上山搬运木材的情形。
    利用拖拉机代替牛马套子运输木材，是一种先进的运输木材方法，运材率要比畜力高三倍。现在东北林业，已部分地采用了这种先进的运材方法。这是东北伊春森林管理局乌敏河现场拖拉机运材的情形。
    荒山造林，可以防止洪水冲毁田地。这是甘肃天水因为山上缺乏林木，所以洪水冲下的沙石淹没了田地，造成农民的很大损失。
    建立防风林网可以根本改造自然条件，杜绝风沙灾害。这是冀西新乐、行唐县附近生长不久的防风林网，由于树林已经起了防风沙的作用，庄稼长得非常兴旺。
    奖励普遍造林，消灭山荒，特别鼓励营造生长迅速的各种林木。中南军政委员会农林部为了实现十年消灭山荒，绿化湖北的计划。这是武昌林场大量培育苗圃的情形。
    在林区附近引火烧肥，结果常常引起森林火灾，是造成森林破坏最主要的原因。这是华东某林区附近的农民引火烧肥，波及林木的情形。
    在林区附近放牲畜，也是森林被毁坏的原因之一。这是甘肃天水陇南龙王沟羊群破坏树木的情形。
    滥砍乱伐，以伐木来解决地方财政问题，都是对国家木材资源的最大危害。这是华东某林区滥砍乱伐后的现象。
    木材经森林铁路的机车集中后，及时地供应全国各地需要。这是机车拉运木材的情形。
