Xinhua News Agency, September 15th:

    French "Tonight" reporter Bertrand reported from Kaesong on the 14th: Washington's conspiracy in the Korean issue has once again failed. This conspiracy originally planned for Van Fleet to seize through force a large part of the 12,000 square kilometers of land that Joy had demanded at the negotiating table. After a month of bloody battles, Van Fleet did not even capture one hundred square kilometers on the entire front. His boastful bragging a month ago has now been replaced by the feeble lament of "I welcome any offensive by the Communists."
    For several weeks, the United States attempted to obtain at the conference table what they had failed to obtain by force. By mid-August, this attempt had failed, so Van Fleet came to reverse the situation and attempted to seize through military means what he had not obtained in the conference. At the same time, Ridgway's headquarters began its series of assassination plots, attempting to force the Korean-Chinese representatives to leave Kaesong and interrupt the negotiations. Only after Van Fleet's offensive and the conspiracy to drive the Korean-Chinese representatives out of Kaesong had clearly failed, did the U.S. side for the first time, not sincerely, acknowledge their actual responsibility for the shelling incident on the 10th.
    The setbacks suffered by the U.S. side on every front have left them stunned and distressed. Van Fleet, with the racist arrogance of American soldiers, wailed: There are Caucasian experts on the front lines. He dares not think about the fact that his elite troops in the Iron Triangle area were repelled by Asians, and that his jet planes, including the latest and best-performing British planes, were shot down by Korean pilots flying MiG aircraft. He also dares not think about the fact that in the past two months, his air force has had planes shot down by ground fire every day. He says: There must be white-skinned people, there are Caucasians on the front lines.
    Van Fleet understands in his heart that his soldiers want to go home. Washington should also understand this. Prisoners captured in early September, when answering the question of why they surrendered, said: They believe this is the only way to go home quickly. One prisoner summarized everyone's words, saying: "With our superiors acting the way they are, we only have one way to escape the war, and that is to have you drive us out of Korea, the sooner the better. The more of us who surrender, the sooner we will be driven out." The vast majority of them are afraid of having to spend another winter here. With such low morale in the army, how can you launch a major offensive and win a victory? Van Fleet has lost a large number of his troops and already understands this.
    Opposite his demoralized army on the entire Korean battlefield is an army where everyone knows why they are fighting, and is completely convinced of the justice of their cause of fighting for their country and defending their borders. It is these people who have made Joy's boast at the conference table that his air force controls North Korea all the way to the Yalu River a laughingstock. In order to cover up Van Fleet's losses, the U.S. side published astronomical figures of air force destruction of vehicles, but this does not change the nature of the resistance encountered by the U.S. military in this offensive in the slightest. Supplies are still being continuously transported to the front lines. The power of the air force cannot render the main highways useless, not even for one night, even though these highways have to pass through numerous bridges. These are all realities that the situation forces the U.S. side to consider.

    美方会场讹诈与战场进攻全遭失败
    【新华社十五日讯】法国巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌十四日自开城报道：华盛顿这次在朝鲜问题上玩弄的阴谋还是失败了。这个阴谋原来计划要范佛里特以武力攫取乔埃在会议桌上所要求的一万二千平方公里土地的一大部分。经过一个月的血战，范佛里特在整个战线上连一百平方公里都没有夺到手。他一个月前大言不惭的吹牛，昨天已代之以“我欢迎共产党的任何攻势”这样无力的哀鸣了。
    美国有几个星期曾企图在会议桌上取得他们用武力未能得到的东西。到八月中旬，这种企图失败了，于是范佛里特就来扭转局面，又企图用军事手段来夺取在会议上没有得到的东西。同时，李奇微总部开始了它一连串的谋杀行动，想迫使朝中代表离开开城，使谈判中断。一直到范佛里特的攻势和把朝中代表赶出开城的阴谋都显然遭到失败之后，美方才第一次不是真心诚意地承认了他们对十日扫射事件事实上应负的责任。
    美方在每一条战线上所遭到的挫败使它们目瞪口呆，苦恼得很。范佛里特以美国军人所怀的种族主义的骄横，哇哇地叫喊着：前线有高加索种的专家。他不敢去想一想：他的精锐部队在铁三角地带是被亚洲人击退的，他的喷气式飞机，其中还有英国最新式的性能最好的飞机在内，也是被驾驶米格式机的朝鲜人击落的。他也不敢去想一下：过去两个月中他的空军天天都有飞机被地面炮火击落。他说：一定是有白皮肤的人，前线上有高加索种人。
    范佛里特心中明白，他的士兵想回家。这一点华盛顿也应该是明白的。九月初捉到的俘虏在答覆他们为什么投降的问题时说：他们认为这是能赶快回家的唯一的路。有一个俘虏概括了大家的话，他说：“照我们的上级那样搞法，我们只有一条路脱离战争，那就是让你们把我们赶出朝鲜，愈快愈好。我们投降的人愈多，我们被赶出去的日子也就来得愈快。”他们绝大部分人都害怕还要在这里过一个冬。军队的士气这样，你怎能发动大攻势打胜仗呢？范佛里特损失了他的大量的军队，已经明白这一点了。
    在整个朝鲜战场上和他这支士气衰败的军队相对峙的，是这样一支军队；那里面的每个人都知道他为什么而战，完全确信自己为祖国、为保卫自己的边疆而战的事业的正义性。就是他们这些人，使乔埃在会议桌上吹嘘他的空军控制着北朝鲜直到鸭绿江的话，成了笑柄。美方为了掩盖范佛里特的损失，发表了一些空军击毁车辆的天文数字，但是这并不能使美军这次攻势所受到的抵抗的性质有丝毫两样。供应品还是源源不断地运到前线。空军的威力并不能使主要的公路失去作用，即使一个晚上也不能，虽然这些公路还得通过许许多多桥梁。这些都是形势迫使美方不能不考虑的一些现实。
