Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The movement of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China to increase production and practice economy, with a value equivalent to five million tons of grain, has achieved great results. To date, the total value of increased production and savings planned by various enterprises has exceeded the value of ten million tons of grain. Various enterprises are now actively mobilizing all employees to strive to unleash their creativity and tap the industrial potential for the specific plans of their units.

The increase in production and savings of five million tons of grain was proposed by Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, at the urban work conference convened by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in May this year. He called on enterprises in Northeast China to tap industrial potential in addition to completing the original production plan for this year, and to increase production and savings for the country with a value equivalent to five million tons of grain. State-owned and public enterprises in Northeast China responded to this call and specifically studied the production, capital, cost, and other aspects of their units, and formulated plans to increase production and practice economy. According to the plan, the total value of increased production and savings of state-owned enterprises this year will reach more than ten million tons of grain, exceeding the original task of increasing production and practicing economy by one-fold.

Currently, factories and mines are deeply mobilizing the masses of employees to transform this plan of increasing production and practicing economy into the conscious action of all employees. Many advanced examples have emerged in various factories and mines in increasing output, improving quality, reducing costs, saving capital, and improving labor productivity. The nationally renowned Ma Hengchang Group of a certain machine factory has formulated a plan for the group to increase production and save wealth worth thirty tons of grain in the second half of this year, and has made considerable achievements in maximizing equipment utilization. The group previously worked eight hours a day, and the effective running time of the machine was three hours and forty minutes, which has now been increased to five hours and thirty minutes. In terms of reducing defective products, the group promoted the increase of the finished product rate from 99.5% to 99.75% throughout the workshop. Zhang Wenfu Group of the oil extraction department of the Shengli Oil and Rice Mill in Changbei County, Liaoxi Province, created a new national record in the movement to increase production and practice economy in early August, with an oil extraction rate of 13.9% (13.9 jin of oil from 100 jin of soybeans). The whole group can increase the value of wealth equivalent to 100,760 jin of grain by the end of the year. Li Jingkun, a technician at a certain mining machinery factory, transformed the milling cutter, improving work efficiency by 24 times. The output of each milling machine can increase the value of wealth equivalent to 466 tons of grain in the last four months of this year. Employees of a certain factory proposed 157 rationalization proposals in 20 days, of which more than 50 were considered by the leadership to be adopted and have been successfully tested. The rationalization proposal on the transformation of the furnace alone, after implementation, improved product quality by 5% and increased output by 42.2%, with a monthly increase in wealth equivalent to more than 300 tons of grain.

In recent months, many factory and mine workers have reported good news to Chairman Gao Gang with new achievements on the production front. They listed the possible conditions for their units to achieve the plan of increasing production and practicing economy, expressing their determination to complete the plan. The report of all the employees of a certain cement plant stated: Due to the development of potential capabilities, their factory had completed the nine-month production task one month ahead of schedule, the quality of cement had also been improved, and the cost had been reduced by 10%. Therefore, they were confident in completing the plan of increasing production and saving wealth equivalent to 55,800 tons of grain. A letter from all the employees of the forging workshop of a certain machine repair factory stated that everyone in their workshop had used their brains to tap potential capabilities and formulated personal plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and these plans were very practical and specific. The first-class products produced by the workshop in the recent month have been increased to 99.6%, and the output has exceeded the plan by 308%.

This movement of increasing production and practicing economy by the working class in Northeast China is of extremely great significance. Because the movement of increasing production and practicing economy will not only further improve the operation and management of Northeast China's industry, but also the value of 10 million tons of grain created can be used to greatly develop production. Ten million tons of grain can be used to equip 32 new-style spinning mills with 50,000 spindles, or can be used to establish a power station with a power of 800,000 kilowatts, or can be used to purchase more than 213,000 sets of new-style animal-drawn agricultural machinery and tools (each set includes 17 kinds of agricultural tools for spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting); if used for national defense construction, it can purchase more than 4,500 jet fighters.

### 国营企业依靠职工发掘工业潜在能力  东北计划增产节约总值达千万吨粮食  用之于国防建设可购喷气式战斗机四千五百架

    国营企业依靠职工发掘工业潜在能力
    东北计划增产节约总值达千万吨粮食
    用之于国防建设可购喷气式战斗机四千五百架
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】东北各国营企业增产节约价值等于五百万吨粮食的运动，已有巨大成绩。到目前为止，各企业计划增产节约的价值的总和已超过了一千万吨粮食的价值。各企业单位现正积极动员全体职工，努力发挥创造性，发掘工业的潜在能力，为本单位的具体计划而奋斗。
    增产节约五百万吨粮食，是中共中央东北局书记、东北人民政府主席高岗在今年五月中共中央东北局召开的城市工作会议上提出的。他号召东北各企业要在完成今年原订生产计划以外，发掘工业潜在能力，为国家再增产与节约价值等于五百万吨粮食的财富。东北各国营、公营企业纷纷响应了这一号召，并具体研究了本单位的生产、资金、成本等方面的情况，制订了增产节约计划。根据计划，各国营企业今年增产节约的总值，共计可达一千万余吨粮食，已超过原订增产节约任务的一倍。
    目前，各厂、矿正深入动员职工群众，使这一增产节约计划变成全体职工的自觉行动。各厂、矿在增加产量、提高质量、降低成本、节约资金、提高劳动生产率等方面，已涌现许多先进事例。全国闻名的某机器厂马恒昌小组，订出了该组今年下半年增产节约价值等于三十吨粮食的财富的计划，并已在发挥设备运用率方面有相当成绩。该组以前每天工作八小时，机器的有效转动时间是三点四十分钟，现在已提高到五点三十分钟。在减少废品方面，该组推动全车间把成品率由百分之九十九点五提高到百分之九十九点七五。辽西省昌北县胜利制油米厂制油部张文富小组，在增产节约运动中，于八月初创造了出油率达百分之十三点九（一百斤大豆制油十三斤九两）的全国新纪录，全组至年底可增产价值等于十万零七百六十斤粮食的财富。某矿山机械厂技术员李静崑改造了铣刀，提高工作效率二十四倍，每台铣床的产量，在今年最后四个月中可增产价值等于四百六十六吨粮食的财富。某厂职工在二十天中，提出一百五十七件合理化建议，其中五十多件经领导上研究认为可以采用，并已试验成功。仅关于改造熔炉的一项合理化建议，实行后提高产品质量百分之五，提高产量百分之四十二点二，每月增加的财富等于三百多吨粮食。
    数月以来，许多厂矿的职工纷纷以生产战线上的新成就向高岗主席报捷。他们列举本单位实现增产节约计划的可能条件，表示自己完成计划的决心。某水泥厂全体职工的报告中说：他们厂由于发挥潜在能力，九个月的生产任务已提前一个月完成，水泥的质量也提高了，成本降低了百分之十。因此，他们有信心完成增产节约价值等于五万五千八百吨粮食的财富的计划。某机器修理厂锻造车间全体职工的信中说，他们车间的每个人，都开动脑筋，发掘潜在能力，制订了个人的增产节约计划，这些计划都很切实具体。该车间最近一个月生产的一级品，已提高到百分之九十九点六，产量超过计划百分之三百零八。
    东北工人阶级的这一增产节约运动是有极其重大的意义的。因为增产节约运动不仅将进一步提高东北工业的经营管理工作，而且所创造的一千万吨粮食的价值，可以用来大大发展生产。一千万吨粮食可以用来装备拥有五万枚纱锭的新式纱厂三十二所，或可建立拥有八十万瓩电力的发电站，或可购买新式马拉机械农具二十一万三千余套（每套包括春耕、夏锄、秋收的各种农具十七件）；如果用之于国防建设，就可购买喷气式战斗机四千五百余架。
