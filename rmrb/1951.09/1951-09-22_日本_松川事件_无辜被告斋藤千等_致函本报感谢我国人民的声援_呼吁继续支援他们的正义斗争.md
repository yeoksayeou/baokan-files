Editor's Note: Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" innocent defendants Saito Sen, Kobayashi Genzaburo, Nikaido Takeo, Hamasaki Futao, and Kikuchi Takeshi have written to this newspaper to express their gratitude for the sympathy and support given to them by the people of our country, and to call on the Chinese people to continue to support their just struggle. These letters were delayed in transit, and are only now being translated and published. From these letters, we can see the heroic spirit of the Japanese working class in the struggle against the US-Japanese reactionaries. We hereby express our infinite respect to them. The Chinese people will do their utmost to support their heroic struggle until final victory.

(1)
We extend our heartfelt respect and deep gratitude to the People's Daily in Beijing, which guides the liberation of the Asian people and provides us with important pointers for defending peace and opposing aggression. Since the beginning of this year, you have constantly given us deep friendship and strong support full of comrade-like love, and all twenty of the innocent defendants and their families in the "Matsukawa Incident" are deeply moved.

We will submit an appeal to the Sendai High Court before July 23. If it is accepted, a second trial can be held to clarify the truth; if it is rejected, we will be sent to the gallows. We are now at a critical juncture of life and death. It is said that a separate peace treaty with Japan will be signed in San Francisco in September. According to this "treaty," Japan will openly become a military base for US imperialism, an aggressive base for attacking your country and the Asian people, and the Japanese nation will be reduced to slavery and destruction.

The "Matsukawa Incident" struggle is one of the important opportunities to break the US illegal separate peace conspiracy. We have been doing our best to fight, writing accusatory letters and appeals constantly until our eyes are blurred, our hands are sore, and our arms are numb. The "million signatures demanding acquittal" and the movement to raise one million yen in struggle funds for the "Matsukawa Incident" in Japan are facing various pressures and difficulties, and whether they can be completed in time has reached the most important stage. Therefore, on behalf of the twenty of us, I ask you through your newspaper to request strong support from all the brothers in China.

First, we ask the Chief Judge of the Sendai High Court, Suzuki Teijiro, to hold a second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" to clarify the truth, declare the twenty of us innocent, abolish the original judgment, and defend Japan's independence and peace.

Second, we want to tell Judge Suzuki not to succumb to the power behind him, to uphold Japan's national dignity and the honor of the motherland to the end, and to oppose the conspiracy to turn Japan into a military base for attacking China and the Asian people, even at the cost of his life.

This needs to be done in August, as it will be too late after the appeal is rejected. In any case, please ask all the brothers in China to give us comprehensive assistance and support through your newspaper.

The Korean armistice talks are proceeding due to the sincere efforts of the Chinese and Korean people. In such a real situation, we firmly believe that if the Japanese people unite as one and advance together with the Asian people, they will surely be able to smash US imperialism's aggression, and we will be able to get out of prison in independence and peace.

Although we are constantly writing letters in prison to demand a comprehensive peace treaty, the withdrawal of all occupation forces, opposition to rearmament, and the signing of a peace pact by the five major powers, it still falls short of what is needed. However, only through struggle can we achieve victory and liberation. If we do not fight, we will lose everything. We eagerly hope for great support from the Chinese people to smash the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism and win the victory of peace and independence!

On behalf of the twenty of us, I shake hands tightly with the Chinese people and ask for support!

(2) To the Beijing People's Daily:

The great voice of the people's protest has come across the sea like a storm!

US imperialism and its running dogs fabricated an "incident" that had nothing to do with us and arrested the twenty of us. In order to make the Japanese people cannon fodder, they are suppressing the Japanese people and their parties in the same way as the past Japanese fascists, and want to impose completely unjustified charges on the working people.

The great Chinese people's storm-like protests will surely clarify the facts.

We believe that the day will come when today's judges will be judged.

We believe that Chinese brothers are concerned about us.

We believe that truth will ultimately prevail and that the people are the final judges.

We fight strongly for Japan's independence and peace.

Chinese brothers, we hope that you will fight strongly for the construction of a new China.
Kobayashi Genzaburo, January 27

(3) To the Comrades of the Beijing People's Daily:

I feel supremely happy to send greetings to the comrades from Japan and shake your hands tightly.

I congratulate the Chinese comrades on the great victories you have achieved in difficult situations, and I pay tribute to you for reporting true news to the world every day. We deeply appreciate your protests against the treacherous verdict in the "Matsukawa Incident" and your demands for the acquittal of the twenty of us. The strong support and encouragement of the comrades has increased our confidence and courage. I feel infinite hatred for the class enemy, and I am proud to be fighting as a revolutionary soldier in an increasingly fascist Japan. I vow to overcome all difficulties and fight to the end, and I send my respects to the comrades from prison.
Nikaido Takeo, January 23

(4) To the Beijing People's Daily and the Chinese Electrical Workers' Union, Liulihe Cement Plant, Seamen, Coal Mines, Machine Manufacturing, Postal, Telecommunications, Education, and Transportation Unions, and forwarded to all the People of China:

The tyrannical enemy—the reactionary ruling class—has finally been seen by us as completely inhuman, and the court has also been controlled by black hands and has become treacherous. As a result of the public trial on December 6 last year, we were sentenced. Because we are Communists and trade union members, these lackeys have imprisoned the twenty of us on the pretext of the "Matsukawa Incident." The lackeys, prosecutors, and police used all means to force us to confess and madly fabricated false facts.

A hundred interrogations have not produced any proof, but have instead proven that we are innocent and have nothing to do with the so-called "Matsukawa Incident." But these lackeys ignored these facts.

Our anger and hatred for this verdict are growing more and more intense, and at the same time, our confidence and courage in the final victory shining on the people are also growing stronger. We are determined to fight decisively.

Chinese comrades: we express our heartfelt gratitude for your protests and your great encouragement to us. In order to repay your expectations and to defend the truth and the peace and independence of all peoples, we vow to fight to the end to win the second trial.
Hamasaki Futao, January 23

(5) To the Comrades of the Beijing People's Daily:

We were arrested because of a conspiracy incident created by the imperialists. We rose up to fight against the treacherous fascist trial. We must overthrow the shameless verdict and fight resolutely to the end for truth and justice.

The reactionary ruling class trampled on truth and justice and arbitrarily sentenced us to crimes including the death penalty. The government-controlled radio stations and newspapers made false and slanderous propaganda full of contradictions. Over the past year, I have personally experienced that in today's Japan, the trial is not a trial, and the prosecutor's indictment is not the prosecutor's indictment, but rather the reactionary ruling class controls everything and arbitrarily declares us guilty. If there were judges with a little conscience, if they had clarified this unjust "incident", then they could not have sentenced us to such an unjust crime. However, the running dogs of the Yoshida reactionary cabinet have arbitrarily and illegally sentenced us like mental patients.

Who needs this "incident"? I don't need to say it. The reactionary ruling class created a big conspiracy to suppress the Japanese Communist Party and the trade unions in order to drive the Japanese people to engage in another cruel war, which has already been clearly revealed.

We will continue to fight until this gang of thugs and their lackeys cannot survive in the world. With full confidence and courage, we are constantly advancing on the revolutionary road in order to realize a wonderful free and happy society like the Soviet Union as soon as possible.

We firmly believe that truth will surely prevail, and we will fight to the end for national independence!
Kikuchi Takeshi (19 years old), January 26

    日本“松川事件”无辜被告斋藤千等
    致函本报感谢我国人民的声援
    呼吁继续支援他们的正义斗争
    编者按：日本“松川事件”无辜被告斋藤千、小林源三郎、二阶堂武夫、滨崎二雄、菊池武五人，先后写信给本报，对我国人民给他们的同情与支援表示感谢，呼吁中国人民继续支援他们所进行的正义斗争。这些信件由于辗转传递，致迟至现在始译出发表。从这些信件中，可以看到日本工人阶级在反对美日反动派的斗争中的英雄气概，我们谨在此对他们表示无限的敬意。中国人民将以最大努力支援他们的英勇斗争，直到最后胜利。
    （一）
    我们向指导亚洲人民的解放、给予我们保卫和平反对侵略的重要指针的北京人民日报致衷心的敬意和深挚的谢忱。从今年年初开始不断地给了我们洋溢着同志热爱的深厚友情和强力支援，我们二十名“松川事件”无辜被告和家属全都深深地感动了。
    我们将在七月二十三日以前，向仙台高等裁判所提出上诉书。如果被接受了，那就可以举行第二审使真象大白；如果被拒绝了，我们就要被送上绞刑台。现在我们已经是站在生死关头了。听说九月在旧金山签订单独对日和约，依据这个“和约”，日本将公开地变成美帝国主义的军事基地，变成进攻贵国和亚洲人民的侵略基地，日本民族将沦于奴隶与毁灭的命运。
    “松川事件”的斗争，是打破美国非法单独媾和阴谋的重要契机之一。我们一直在尽全力进行斗争，眼花、手酸、腕臂发麻地继续不断在写控诉信和呼吁书。日本国内对“松川事件”展开的“百万人签名要求无罪释放”和募集百万日圆斗争资金的运动，由于种种压迫和困难，时间上能否来得及，已经到了最重要的阶段。因此，我代表我们二十人托你们通过贵报，请求全中国的弟兄们给我们强有力的支援。
    第一、为我们要求仙台市仙台高等裁判所铃木祯次郎裁判长举行“松川事件”第二审，判明真实，宣布我们二十人无罪，废除原判决，保卫日本的独立与和平。
    第二、为我们告诉铃木裁判长，要他绝对不要向他背后的权力屈服，严守日本的民族尊严和祖国名誉到底，不惜生命去反对变日本为进攻中国及亚洲人民的军事基地和侵略基地的阴谋。
    这需要在八月里做到，如果在上诉被拒绝后就迟了。无论如何，请通过贵报请求全中国的弟兄们给我们全面的协助和支援。
    朝鲜的停战谈判，由于中朝人民的真诚努力而进行着。在这样的现实情况中，我们坚决确信：如果日本全国人民团结一致，和亚洲人民共同前进，那就一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，我们也就可以在独立与和平中出狱。
    我们在狱中虽然不断借写信进行要求全面媾和、撤退全部占领军、反对重新武装及要求五大国缔结和平公约的斗争，但到底还赶不上需要。可是，唯有倚靠斗争才能获得胜利和解放，如果不斗争，就要失去一切。我们热望来自中国人民的巨大支援，以粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，争取和平与独立的胜利！
    谨代表我们二十人与中国人民紧紧地紧紧地握手，并请求支援！
    宫城县仙台市宫城刑务所  斋藤千
    七月十八日
    （二）北京人民日报：
    伟大的人民抗议的声音越过大海、暴风雨一样的来临了！
    美帝国主义及其走狗制造和我们毫无关系的“事件”，把我们二十人逮捕。他们为了要使日本人民充当炮灰，就和过去的日本法西斯同样地对日本人民及其政党加以镇压，要把完全冤枉的罪名强加在劳动人民的身上。
    伟大的中国人民暴风雨般地抗议，一定能把事实弄明白的。
    我们相信今天的裁判者被裁判的日子，就要来到了。
    我们相信中国弟兄们关切着我们。
    我们相信真理最后必获胜利，人民才是最后的裁判者。
    我们坚强地为日本的独立与和平而斗争。
    中国的弟兄们，盼你们坚强地为建设新中国而斗争。    
  小林源三郎一月二十七日
    （三）北京人民日报的同志们：
    从日本向同志们问候，我感到无上的喜悦，向你们紧紧地握手。
    我祝贺中国同志们在困难的情势下取得了伟大的胜利，并对你们每天向全世界报道真实新闻表示敬意。我们深深感谢你们这次对“松川事件”卖国判决提出的抗议和无罪释放我们二十人的要求。同志们的强大支援和鼓励，增加了我们的信心和勇气。我对阶级敌人涌出无限的憎恨，为自己在日趋法西斯化的日本作为革命战士而斗争的光荣感到骄傲，并宣誓今后克服一切困难斗争到底，谨从狱中向同志们致敬。    二阶堂武夫一月二十三日
    （四）北京人民日报及中国电业工会、琉璃河水泥厂、海员、煤矿、机器制造、邮政、电信、教育、运输工会并转中国人民诸君：
    暴虐的敌人——反动统治阶级，终于被我们看出他们是毫无人心的，法庭也被黑色魔手掌握而卖国奴化了。去年十二月六日公审的结果，判决了我们。因为我们是共产党员，又是工会会员，所以这帮奴才们就假借“松川事件”为名，把我们二十人陷入狱中拘禁着。卖国奴才们的爪牙检事、警察，使用所有的手段强迫我们招供，疯狂地捏造虚伪的事实。
    一百次的审问没有得到任何证明，反过来证明了我们是冤枉、与所谓“松川事件”毫无关系。但是这帮奴才们却不理会这些。
    我们对这个判决的愤怒与憎恶，愈来愈剧烈以至恨入骨髓，同时对于辉耀在人民头上的最后胜利的信心和勇气也愈来愈坚强。我们决心断然进行斗争。
    中国同志们：你们为我们提出的抗议和给我们巨大的鼓励，我们全体由衷地表示谢意。为了答谢你们的期望，为了保卫真理和所有人民的和平与独立，我们宣誓斗争到底，以争取第二审的胜利。
    滨崎二雄  一月二十三日
    （五）北京人民日报的同志们：
    我们因帝国主义者制造的阴谋事件而被逮捕。我们奋起和卖国的法西斯裁判进行斗争。我们要推翻无耻的判决，为真理和正义而坚决斗争到底。
    反动统治阶级蹂躏了真理和正义，横暴地宣判我们包括死刑的罪刑。御用的广播电台和报纸，作出充满矛盾的虚伪的诬蔑宣传。这一年来，我亲身体验到在今天的日本，裁判不是裁判，检事公诉不是检事的公诉，而是反动统治阶级一手掌握、任意宣告我们有罪。假如是有一点良心的法官，假如他们把这冤枉的“事件”判明，那就不能对我们判决这样冤屈的罪刑。但是，吉田反动内阁的走狗，精神病患者一样地横暴地非法地判决了我们。
    这“事件”对谁是必要的呢？已不用我说了。反动统治阶级为了镇压日本共产党和工会，以驱使日本人民再从事冷酷的战争而制造的大阴谋，这已经是明白地显示出来了。
    我们继续斗争，一直到这伙暴徒及其爪牙不能在全世界生存为止。我们为了早日实现像苏联那样美好的自由幸福的社会，满怀信心和勇气，坚强地在革命的道路上不断迈进。
    我们确信真理必定胜利，我们为民族的独立斗争到底！
    菊池武（十九岁）  一月二十六日
