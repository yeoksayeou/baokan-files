    Welcoming the Volunteer Army Representatives Back to the Front Lines

    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army representatives, Comrade Chai Chuanruo and nine other comrades, have victoriously completed their work tasks and are about to leave the motherland and return to the Korean front. We extend our infinite respect to the representatives who have worked diligently in various parts of the country for the past six months, and express our cordial greetings and warm farewell! We extend our lofty revolutionary salute to all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are fighting on the Korean front to defend our great motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

    The propaganda activities of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army representatives in various parts of the country have achieved significant results. Since being invited back to China in February and March this year, under the leadership of the China Peace Committee and local branches, and under the guidance and assistance of leadership organs and people's organizations at all levels, the Volunteer Army representatives have reported to people in various regions about the heroic struggles on the Korean front; promoted the great patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side; publicized the great efforts of the people of the motherland in supporting the Korean front; promoted the steel-like fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples; and also exposed and condemned the unprecedentedly brutal crimes of the American imperialist aggressor troops in Korea. They have greatly inspired the people of the motherland's determination and confidence to love their country and support the Volunteer Army in defeating the American aggressors; promoted the motherland's movement to increase production and donations for resisting America and aiding Korea and other central tasks; and especially, they have emotionally connected the inseparable flesh-and-blood relationship between the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people on the Korean front! They are now about to return to the front, carrying the unparalleled enthusiasm of the 475 million people of the motherland who care for the Volunteer Army, and the ironclad guarantee of full support for the Volunteer Army.

    Over the past six months, the Volunteer Army representatives have traveled more than 102,000 li across 172 cities and counties and vast rural areas in 24 provinces across the country; met with 10.25 million people, delivered radio speeches to more than 34.5 million organized listeners, and used radio recordings, newspapers, pamphlets, meetings, and other methods to report to the people across the country about the heroic struggles on the Korean front. In addition, the Volunteer Army representatives also visited Mao Zedong and Commander Peng Dehuai's hometown – Xiangtan, visited the old revolutionary bases of Fujian, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and other provinces, visited the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, the Southwest, and the Northwest, and widely contacted people from all walks of life, including workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers, youth, women, children, and people from the cultural, industrial, commercial, and religious circles. The people of the whole country regard it as supreme glory to be able to meet with the Volunteer Army representatives, hear their reports, and touch them. Wherever the Volunteer Army representatives went, the streets were packed, and the crowds were overwhelming; from the Bohai Bay to the Pamir Plateau, from Inner Mongolia to the southwestern border, regardless of ethnicity, class, gender, or age, the people everywhere showed inspiring love and heartfelt concern for the Volunteer Army; especially workers, peasants, students, women, and children, all regarded paying tribute to the Volunteer Army as a strong political demand, and all called the Volunteer Army "the most beloved people."

    The reason why the people love the Volunteer Army so much is, of course, not accidental. First of all, it is because our heroic Volunteer Army, on the Korean battlefield, bravely, resourcefully, arduously, and fearlessly fought alongside the Korean People's Army, constantly defeating the most powerful, most dangerous, and most vicious American aggressors in the imperialist camp, making the people of the whole country truly realize how strong our country and people's strength has become, and giving the people of the whole country and the world steel-like determination and confidence in stopping aggression and safeguarding peace. Secondly, it is because our great victory in resisting America and aiding Korea has stopped the American aggressors' conspiracy to burn the flames of war to our country, protected the fruits of victory of our people, and protected our people's peaceful and happy lives. People are aware of this kind of happiness, and know where the happiness comes from. Therefore, people can't help but express their love for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and its representatives from the bottom of their hearts. Thirdly, the fundamental reason is that the liberated Chinese people, under the teachings of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have realized that they are the masters of the country; they hate the American aggression against Korea, the occupation of our Taiwan, and the destruction of peace in the Far East to the bone; and they express their heartfelt admiration and gratitude for the selfless heroic acts of the most outstanding children of our people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—on the Korean front, and the great victories they have achieved.

    The masses of the people throughout the country are further uniting ideologically and politically to become a tremendous force for defeating the American aggressors. Now we can see very clearly: the Volunteer Army attributes the glory of the victory at the front to our great motherland and people; and our people place the hope of their happy lives on the Volunteer Army. The people of our country are all shouting a voice: "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, Defend Peace in the Far East and the World!"

    Today, the movement of our people to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country has achieved great success. In terms of donating aircraft alone, as of September 21, it has reached 2,481. The people of our country are never satisfied with the achievements they have made, and will never be proud of them. On the contrary, we see that the American aggressors have repeatedly sabotaged the Kaesong armistice negotiations, illegally convened the San Francisco Conference, unilaterally signed the illegal "Japanese Peace Treaty," long-term occupied Japan and intensified the arming of Japan, completely exposing their lack of sincerity for peace. Therefore, we must strengthen the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, strengthen our national defense construction, and unite the people of all Asia and the world to smash all the conspiracies of American imperialism. All our compatriots must make persistent efforts and give full support to our most beloved people on the Korean front!

    We ask the Volunteer Army representatives to bring the unified hope of the people of the motherland to every Volunteer Army comrade on the Korean front after returning to the Korean front, and bring the deepest friendship of the Chinese people to the Korean people and the heroic People's Army. Dear Volunteer Army comrades! You are on the forefront of defending the motherland, defending the Far East, and defending world peace. The people of the whole of China and the peace-loving people of the world are watching you with admiration, placing the hope of peace and happiness on you, and supporting you with all their strength! In front of you is the world's most ferocious, most dangerous, and most cunning enemy, the utterly vicious American imperialists and their accomplices. The lesson of the Kaesong negotiations tells us that the American aggressors are unscrupulous and shameless, and they only recognize force. Therefore, in order to defend our great motherland, in order to defend peace in the Far East and the world, we must be ready at all times to continue to give the mad aggressors heavier blows. Only in this way will we force the aggressors to recognize the power of the people. Only in this way can we achieve the great goal of defending peace.

    欢送志愿军归国代表重返前线
    中国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若等十位同志，已经胜利地完成了他们的工作任务，就要离开祖国重返朝鲜前线了。我们谨以无限的敬意，向半年以来在祖国各地辛勤工作的各位代表同志，表示亲切的慰问和热烈的欢送！向正在朝鲜前线为保卫我们伟大祖国、保卫远东与世界和平的中国人民志愿军全体同志们，致以崇高的革命敬礼！
    中国人民志愿军归国代表在全国各地的宣传活动，是有重大成绩的。志愿军各位归国代表，从今年二、三月间应邀回国以来，在中国人民抗美援朝总会和各地分会的领导之下，在各级领导机关和人民团体的指导和协助之下，向各地人民报告了朝鲜前线英勇斗争的情况；宣传了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的伟大爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的精神；宣传了祖国人民支援朝鲜前线的伟大努力；宣传了中、朝人民亲密团结的钢铁般的战斗友谊；同时也揭露和控诉了美帝国主义侵略军在朝鲜史无前例的残暴罪行。他们极大地鼓舞了祖国人民热爱祖国、支援志愿军战胜美国侵略者的决心和信心；推动了祖国人民抗美援朝的增产捐献运动和其他中心工作；特别是把祖国各族人民和朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民之间的血肉不可分离的联系，从情感上更加紧密地连结起来了！他们现在又要带着祖国四亿七千五百万人民关怀志愿军的无比的热情，和全力支援志愿军的铁的保证，回到前线去了。
    志愿军归国代表同志们半年以来走遍全国二十四省的一百七十二个市县和广大乡村，行程十万二千余里；和一千零二十五万人见了面，向三千四百五十多万有组织的听众作了广播讲演，并且运用了广播录音、报刊、小册子、开会传达等方式，向全国人民报告了朝鲜前线英勇斗争的事迹。此外，志愿军归国代表还访问了毛主席和彭司令员的故乡——湘潭，访问了福建、江西、贵州等老革命根据地，访问了内蒙古、西南、西北各族人民，广泛地接触了工人、农民、革命军人、青年、妇女、儿童和文化界、工商界、宗教界等各方面的人物。全国人民都以能和志愿军代表见面，听到志愿军代表的报告，和抚摸志愿军代表而引以为无上光荣。志愿军代表所到之处，万人空巷，人山人海；从渤海湾到帕米尔高原，从内蒙古到西南的边防，不分民族、阶级、男女老幼，人民对志愿军处处表现了令人感奋的热爱和衷心关怀之情；尤其是工人、农民、学生、妇女和儿童，都把向志愿军致意，当成是一种强烈的政治要求，都把志愿军称做“最可爱的人”。
    人民之所以如此热爱志愿军，当然不是偶然的。首先是因为我们英勇的志愿军在朝鲜战场上，勇敢、机智、艰苦、无畏地和朝鲜人民军在一起，不断地打败了帝国主义阵营中最强大、最危险、最恶毒的美国侵略者，使全国人民真正认识了自己的祖国和人民的力量已经发展得多么强大，使全国和全世界人民，对制止侵略、保卫和平的事业，有了钢铁般的决心和信心。其次是因为我们抗美援朝的伟大胜利，阻止了美国侵略者把战火燃烧到我国来的阴谋，保卫了我国人民的胜利果实，保卫了我国人民和平幸福的生活。人们意识到了这一种幸福，并且知道了幸福是从那里来的，因而，人们从内心里不自禁地表现了对中国人民志愿军及其代表的热爱。第三，根本的原因是解放了的中国人民在共产党和毛主席的教导下，认识了自己是国家的主人；对于美国侵略朝鲜、霸占我国台湾、破坏远东和平的罪行，恨之入骨；而对于我国人民最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜前线为了反抗美国侵略者的忘我的英雄行为，和所取得的伟大胜利，表示衷心的钦佩与感激。
    全国人民群众正在从思想上和政治上进一步团结起来成为战胜美国侵略者的巨大力量。现在我们可以看得很清楚：志愿军把前线胜利的光荣，归之于我们伟大的祖国和人民；而我国人民则把自己幸福生活的希望寄托给志愿军。我们全国人民都呼喊着一个声音：“抗美援朝，保家卫国，保卫远东与世界和平！”
    今天，我国人民的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动已获得了巨大的成就。单就捐献飞机一项来说，到九月廿一日为止已达二四八一架。我国人民决不满足于已有的成绩，决不因此而骄傲。相反的，我们看到美国侵略者一次再一次地破坏开城停战谈判，非法召开旧金山会议，片面签订非法的“对日和约”，长期占领日本和加紧武装日本，完全暴露了它们缺乏和平诚意。因此我们就更要加强抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争，加强我们的国防建设，团结全亚洲和全世界的人民，来粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋。我们全国同胞一定要再接再厉，全力支援在朝鲜前线的我们最可爱的人！
    我们要求志愿军代表回到朝鲜前线以后，把祖国人民的一致的希望带给朝鲜前线每一个志愿军同志，把中国人民对朝鲜人民最深厚的友情带给朝鲜人民和英勇的人民军。亲爱的志愿军同志们！你们处在保卫祖国、保卫远东、保卫世界和平的最前线，全中国和全世界爱好和平的人民，都以钦敬的目光在看望着你们，都把和平与幸福的希望寄托在你们的身上，并且都在用全力支援着你们！在你们的面前，是全世界人民最凶恶、最危险、最狡猾的敌人，是穷凶恶极的美帝国主义者及其帮凶。开城谈判的教训告诉我们，美国侵略者是丧尽天良和不顾羞耻的，他们除了武力不认识一切。因此，为了保卫我们伟大的祖国，为了保卫远东和世界的和平，我们必须随时准备继续给疯狂的侵略者以更沉重的打击。只有这样，才会迫使侵略者认识人民的力量。只有这样，才能实现保卫和平的伟大目的。
