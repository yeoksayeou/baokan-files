The third meeting of the Anhui North Huai River Project, held to determine the 1952 Anhui North District Huai River Project, has concluded.

In addition to the members of the Huai River Management Committee stationed in Bengbu and the heads of various departments, responsible comrades from the Huai River Command Headquarters in various regions and key counties, as well as farmer representatives familiar with the situation, attended the meeting. After Zeng Xisheng, Deputy Director of the Huai River Management Committee, reported on the spirit of the Second Huai River Management Meeting of the Central Ministry of Water Resources and the instructions of Premier Zhou Enlai, in-depth research and discussion were carried out based on the central government's intentions and the specific conditions in northern Anhui. The meeting lasted for five days (August 29 to September 2) and established a specific plan for the 1952 Huai River Project in the Anhui North District. A construction plan is currently being further developed.

This meeting was planned under the principles of increasing flood storage to reduce flood peaks, managing inland rivers to further reduce waterlogging, and combining these efforts with solving irrigation problems where possible. Due to a considerable understanding of the root causes of the Huai River's problems, especially with the valuable opinions provided by farmer representatives familiar with the situation, the meeting was very fruitful. First, in terms of flood storage, not only can the task of increasing flood storage by 3 billion cubic meters of water as required by the Central Ministry of Water Resources be completed, but it can also be greatly exceeded (by about 1 billion cubic meters), and it can also be combined with solving irrigation problems in vast areas. The basic requirement for the 1951 Huai River Project was to achieve "no disaster in light rain, reduced disaster in heavy rain"; the 1952 project will not only develop further on this basis, but also focus on solving the phenomenon of "drought in the absence of rain." At the same time, due to the expansion of large and small flood storage areas on the vast ground, the flow of inland rivers will also be reduced accordingly. For example, the Tang, Hui, Tuo, and North Fei rivers in the Suxian area can reduce the flow by 300 to 400 cubic meters per second due to the development of ditches, moats, ponds, and weirs, thereby reducing a lot of engineering work; the same is true for other areas such as Liu'an, Fuyang, and Chuxian. This is another step forward in the 1952 Huai River Project. This progress was achieved under the slogan of "combining dredging with ditches, moats, ponds, and weirs, combining flood storage with irrigation, combining dike repair with dike protection, and combining Huai River management with general farmland water conservancy projects."

After the plan was determined, the meeting discussed the characteristics of the 1952 project, pointed out the advantages and difficulties, determined the ways to overcome the difficulties, clarified the direction of efforts to complete the project, studied the prices, and roughly allocated the funds for each section. After the meeting, various preparations were intensified, with key construction scheduled for September and full-scale deployment in October.

In total, the official Huai River project will involve more than 100 million cubic meters of earthwork in 1952. If the projects such as digging ponds, building weirs, building dams, and digging ditches are added, it will exceed 300 million cubic meters of earthwork, which is about twice as much as in 1951. The scale and scene of the Huai River project this winter and next spring can be imagined.

Since the end of the 1951 Huai River project, the four areas along the Huai River in northern Anhui have started preparations for the 1952 Huai River project. After the second Huai River meeting in northern Anhui, various places drafted the 1952 project plan from bottom to top, and preliminary surveys and measurements were carried out for the main projects, which have now been largely completed. In mid-June, the Fuyang Special District Huai River Command sent three survey teams and one survey team to Taihe, Boxian, Fengtai and other counties to measure the West Fei River, Zhao Wang River, Wu Jia River, Ci River and other river courses and conduct the entire culvert and culvert survey, which was successfully completed in mid-July. In July, the Huai River Management Committee sent another survey team to Menghe River and Honghe River for survey. Suxian Special District began to send two teams in June to measure the Tanghe River, Tuohe River, Anhe River, and Huihe River, which were completed by the end of July. Chuxian Special District and Liu'an Special District have also completed the measurement of the Lao Dang River and other river courses that need to be dredged. Since this year's project is larger than the 1951 project, the number of cadres must not only be increased, but also improved in terms of political, technical, and professional levels. Various places followed the instructions of the Huai River Management Committee. After the completion of the project, in addition to retaining some cadres to do flood control work, the others were concentrated for training. By summarizing and checking the advantages and disadvantages and experiences and lessons in past work, and combining rectification studies and business studies, the level of cadres was improved. For example, the Fuyang Special District has trained more than 2,000 cadres in collection, finance, and health work since June, and the Suxian Special District has trained more than 4,000 people, and the Chuxian Special District has also trained more than 600 people. This work has not yet ended.

Currently, various places are carrying out specific planning and design and construction design in accordance with the general requirements of the third meeting of the Huai River in Northern Anhui, as well as mobilizing and organizing migrant workers and other tasks. Key construction will be carried out in September, and full-scale construction will begin in October. (Wanbei Daily)

### 第二年度皖北治淮工程确定  加大蓄洪，整理内河，工程比第一年度约大一倍  皖北沿淮各地第二年度工程下月将普遍动工

    第二年度皖北治淮工程确定
    加大蓄洪，整理内河，工程比第一年度约大一倍
    皖北沿淮各地第二年度工程下月将普遍动工
    为了确定皖北区一九五二年度治准工程而举行的皖北治淮第三次会议，已经结束。
    这次会议除驻蚌埠治准委员会委员、各部首长参加外，并到有各专区治淮指挥部和各重点县的负责同志以及熟习情况的农民代表。在治淮委员会副主任曾希圣报告中央水利部第二次治淮会议决定的精神和周恩来总理的指示后，即根据中央意旨和皖北具体情况展开了深刻的研究和讨论。会议共历时五天（八月二十九日至九月二日），订定了皖北区的一九五二年度治淮工程的具体规划，现正进一步订定施工计划中。
    这次会议，是在加大蓄洪减低洪峰、整理内河进一步减少内涝并结合解决可能解决的灌溉问题的原则下，进行规划的。由于对淮患症结已有相当了解，特别是各熟习情况的农民代表提供了许多宝贵的意见，因而会议的收获是很大的。首先表现在蓄洪方面，不仅可以完成中央水利部所要求的增蓄三十亿立方公尺洪水的任务，并且可以大为超过（约可多蓄十亿立方公尺左右），还可以结合解决广大地区的灌溉问题。一九五一年度治淮基本要求是达到“小雨免灾、大雨减灾”；一九五二年度不仅在这一基础上更为发展，而且着眼于解决“无雨旱灾”的现象。同时由于在广大地面上大小蓄洪范围的扩大，因而内河流量亦随之减少。如宿县专区之唐、浍、沱、北淝等河，因为沟洫塘堰的发展，即可减少三百到四百个秒立方公尺的流量，随而减少了不少工程；其他如六安、阜阳、滁县等专区也均如此。这是一九五二年度治淮工程上又一进步。这个进步是在“疏浚与沟洫、塘堰相结合，蓄洪与灌溉相结合，修堤与护堤相结合，治淮与普遍的农田水利工程相结合”的口号下获得的。
    在规划确定之后，会议又讨论了一九五二年度工程的特点，指出了有利与困难的所在，确定了克服困难的办法，明确了完成工程的努力方向，研究了方价，大概的分配了各工段的经费。会后即加紧进行各种准备，约计九月重点施工，十月全面展开。
    总计淮河正式工程在一九五二年度有一亿土方以上，如加挑塘、筑堰、打坝、开挖沟洫等工程，则在三亿土方以上，比一九五一年度约大一倍。今冬明春治淮工程的规模和场面，由此即可想见。
    一九五一年度治淮工程结束时起，皖北沿淮四个专区就都着手进行一九五二年度治淮的各项准备工作。在皖北第二次治淮会议后，各地即由下而上地草拟一九五二年度工程计划，主要的工程预先进行勘察和测量，目前已大部完成。阜阳专区治淮指挥部六月中旬派出三个测量队及一个查勘队到太和、亳县、凤台等县，测量西淝河、赵王河、武家河、茨河等河道和进行整个涵闸、涵洞的查勘工作，七月中旬已告胜利完成。七月间治淮委员会另派一查勘队到蒙河、洪河查勘。宿县专区六月份开始派二个队测量唐河、沱河、安河、浍河等河道，七月底已告完成。滁县专区、六安专区也已将老荡河等需要疏浚的河道测量完毕。由于本年度的工程比一九五一年度更大，干部不仅要在数量上增加，而且要在政治、技术、业务水平上提高，各地即遵照治淮委员会指示，工程结束后，除留一部分干部做防汛工作外，其他分别集中训练。通过总结与检查过去工作中的优缺点和经验教训，并结合整风学习及业务学习，使干部的水平提高一步。如阜阳专区自六月份起已集训收方、财务、卫生工作等干部二千多人，宿县专区则集训了四千多人，滁县专区也已集训六百多人。目前这项工作还没有结束。
    现各地正根据皖北治淮第三次会议总的要求，紧张进行具体的规划设计和施工设计，及动员组织民工等其他各项工作。九月份重点施工，十月份普遍动工。（皖北日报）
