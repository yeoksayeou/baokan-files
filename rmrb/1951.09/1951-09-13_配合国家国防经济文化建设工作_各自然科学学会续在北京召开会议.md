Following the instructions of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, these societies discussed and established their respective tasks of conducting research and developing China's scientific work under the guideline of cooperating with the national defense, economic, and cultural construction.

The Chinese Physical Society Discussed
The Allocation of Physics Textbooks for Universities and Middle Schools

The first National Congress of the Chinese Physical Society was held from August 12th to 17th. More than 70 people attended, including representatives from general and branch societies, and observers. After listening to the reports and instructions from government leaders, as well as five special reports on physics work by Yu Guangyuan, Ye Qisun, Wu Youxun, and others, the conference, after heated discussions, determined that the future direction of Chinese physics should be to improve on the basis of popularization, to popularize under the guidance of improvement, and to combine theory with practice. At the same time, it also discussed the allocation of physics textbooks for universities and middle schools, the content and compilation of textbooks, the manufacturing and supply of physics teaching equipment and instruments, the teaching system and the reform of physics courses, and made a "Summary of Physics Teaching Discussions." Finally, the conference unanimously and enthusiastically elected Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, Academician A.F. Ioffe of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and S.A. Shorin, Chairman of the Soviet Stalin Prize Committee, as honorary members.

In addition, the conference discussed and passed more than ten important proposals, including resolutions on the national aquatic resources survey and how to train oceanographic and limnological cadres.

The Chinese Entomological Society Determined that Doing a Good Job
in Pest Control is the Current Central Task

The first National Congress of the Chinese Entomological Society opened on September 1st and closed on September 6th. More than 40 people attended, including representatives of members from various regions, representatives of research, education, and pest control stations, and observers. During the seven-day meeting, the conference clarified that the central task of the Entomological Society at this stage is to do a good job in pest control and to strive to assist the government in achieving a fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation. In the future, the work of the society will focus on: cooperating with and assisting the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, and other relevant research institutions, and calling on members to do more research on applied entomology, especially on pests such as locusts, rice borers, cotton aphids, and rice gall midges, and to seek effective prevention and control methods; compiling and printing entomological journals, books, and the Chinese insect atlas and entomological literature catalogs; assisting the Science Popularization Bureau in carrying out entomological science popularization work; investigating and training entomological specialists and entomologists, and helping them carry out entomological research. Finally, all the representatives of the conference, in order to report on the construction of new China and the progress of entomological research to entomological workers around the world, and to call for the defense of world peace, unanimously adopted an open letter to entomological workers in various countries.
