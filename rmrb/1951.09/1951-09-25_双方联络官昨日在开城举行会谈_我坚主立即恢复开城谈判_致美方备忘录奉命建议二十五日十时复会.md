Xinhua News Agency, 24th: French *Ce Soir* reporter Philippe Baechtold reported from Kaesong on the 24th: Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai ordered their liaison officers this morning to meet with the U.S. liaison officers at Panmunjom to discuss the date and time of the formal meeting. This was mentioned in the prompt reply to Ridgway's letter on Sunday, which was given to the U.S. liaison officer at 8:00 AM local time this morning. The Korean and Chinese side firmly demanded that past incidents be properly handled and that similar incidents be guaranteed not to occur in the future, while pointing out that such matters can only be resolved by the delegations, and not by liaison officers as Ridgway requested.

The liaison officers from both sides met at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM this morning. The U.S. team was led by Captain Kenney. After a brief exchange of views on the meeting location, the liaison officers from both sides went to Kaesong at the suggestion of Colonel Zhang. The meeting was held in the Kaesong conference hall and lasted for about an hour. Ridgway's liaison officers flatly refused to discuss determining the time and date for the immediate resumption of the armistice negotiations. They insisted on discussing a series of "conditions" for resuming the talks proposed by Ridgway.

Prior to this, Ridgway's liaison officers had attempted to avoid receiving Kim Il-sung's reply this morning. At first, they pretended not to understand the phone call asking them to come to Panmunjom at 8 o'clock to pick up the reply. They insisted that they understood it to be 10 o'clock, even though the phone call was repeated dozens of times. Later, they finally admitted that they understood the phone call; at first, they flatly refused to come to Panmunjom, saying: "We plan to pick up the reply when the liaison officers meet at 10 o'clock." Later, the Korean and Chinese side issued the most severe warning to them, saying that if they did not receive this important letter, they would be held responsible; only then did they agree to come. Their helicopter landed in the nearly ripe millet fields, raising dust a few minutes before 8 o'clock. The Korean and Chinese side requested the U.S. liaison officer to send the reply to Ridgway as soon as possible, and suggested that the liaison officers from both sides hold a meeting at 10 o'clock to determine the time and date of the formal meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 24th: This reporter learned from the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers that at 8:00 AM on September 24th, our liaison officer handed over the letter from Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai to General Ridgway to the opposing liaison officer at Panmunjom, and according to the reply from Generals Kim and Peng, invited the opposing liaison officer to Panmunjom at 10:00 AM on September 24th to discuss the date and time for resuming negotiations in Kaesong. At 9:30, the opposing liaison officer notified our side by radio telephone that they agreed to hold a meeting of liaison officers from both sides at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, met with the opposing liaison officers, Captain Kenney and Captain Mulroney, at Panmunjom. After discussions between the two sides, it was decided to hold talks at the Kaesong conference venue. After the talks began, our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, suggested immediately entering into consultations regarding the date and time for resuming negotiations in Kaesong, but Captain Kenney raised the so-called conditions for resumption of the meeting, which had already been fundamentally rejected by Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai. Colonel Zhang Chunshan immediately pointed out sternly that Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai had clearly stated that in order to avoid hindering the progress of the armistice negotiations, negotiations should be resumed immediately in Kaesong, and that the unresolved incidents and the agreement to stipulate and guarantee the strict neutralization of the Kaesong area should be handled by an appropriate body formed by agreement of the delegations of both sides. Our liaison officers were only authorized to discuss the date and time for resuming negotiations in Kaesong. Captain Kenney then replied that the UN forces liaison officers were not only authorized to discuss the date and time for the resumption of the meeting, but also authorized to discuss other conditions related to the resumption of the meeting, and suggested that another liaison officer meeting be held at 10:00 AM on September 25th. Colonel Zhang Chunshan reiterated that in order to quickly resume the armistice negotiations desired by the people of the world, the opposing liaison officer should immediately discuss the date and time for resuming negotiations in Kaesong. At 6:00 PM on September 24th, Colonel Zhang Chunshan handed over a memorandum to the opposing liaison officer at Panmunjom, specifically suggesting that the representatives of both sides formally resume the armistice negotiation meeting at 10:00 AM on September 25th, according to the order of our chief representative. The full text of the memorandum is as follows:

Zhang Chunshan's memorandum to Kenney: "I have reported the progress of this morning's meeting with you to our chief representative. Our chief representative reiterated that Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai's letter to General Ridgway repeatedly pointed out that the resumption of the Kaesong armistice negotiations is what the people of the world desire, and that the Kaesong armistice negotiations should be resumed immediately without further discussion of the conditions for resuming negotiations. Regarding the unresolved incidents and the stipulation of specific, strict, and mutually satisfactory conditions for neutralizing the Kaesong area, they can be handled by an organization to be established by agreement between the two parties at the first meeting after the resumption of negotiations in Kaesong. Liaison officers have no right to handle such issues. I am also not prepared to discuss any such issues with you. I am only authorized to discuss the date and time for resuming negotiations in Kaesong with you. Given that you stated at today's liaison officer meeting that your side is also willing to discuss the date and time for resuming negotiations, I am ordered by our chief representative to suggest that the representatives of both sides resume the meeting at 10:00 AM on September 25th. Please report to your chief representative immediately and hope that you will give a reply before 10:00 AM tomorrow. If our side has not received your consent reply by 10:00 AM tomorrow, I will meet with you at 10:00 AM tomorrow to continue discussing the date and time for resuming negotiations in Kaesong, and only discuss the date and time for resuming negotiations in Kaesong."

    双方联络官昨日在开城举行会谈
    我坚主立即恢复开城谈判
    致美方备忘录奉命建议二十五日十时复会
    【新华社二十四日讯】法国今晚报记者贝却敌二十四日自开城报道：金日成和彭德怀两将军今晨命令他们的联络官在板门店和美方联络官举行会议，讨论正式会议的日期和时间问题。今天早晨本地时间八时交给美方联络官的对李奇微星期日来信的迅速复信中说到这件事。朝中方面坚决要求适当处理过去的事件，并保证将来不致发生类似事件，同时指出这种事情只能由代表团解决，而不能如李奇微所要求的那样由联络官解决。
    双方联络官于今晨十时在板门店会晤。美方小组是由肯尼率领的。双方联络官在就会议地点问题简单交换意见以后，按张上校的建议前往开城。会议在开城会议厅中举行，历一小时许。李奇微的联络官断然拒绝讨论确定立即恢复停火谈判的时间与日期问题。他们却坚持要讨论李奇微所提出的恢复和谈的一连串“条件”。
    在此以前，李奇微的联络官今晨曾企图避不接受金日成的复信。起先他们假装听不懂要求他们在八点钟到板门店来取复信的电话。他们硬说听懂的是十点钟，虽然电话重覆了几十次。后来他们终于承认听懂了电话；起先他们断然拒绝到板门店来，他们说：“我们打算在联络官在十点钟会晤时去取复信。”后来朝中方面对他们提出最严厉的警告说，如果他们不接这个重要的信件，他们应负责任；这时他们才答应前来。他们的直升飞机在八点之前几分钟扬着灰尘在快要成熟的小米谷田当中着陆。朝中方面要求美方联络官把复信尽快发给李奇微，并建议双方联络官在十时举行会议，以决定正式会议的时间与日期。
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本社记者由朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团获悉：九月二十四日上午八时，我方联络官将金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员致李奇微将军的信件在板门店递交对方联络官，并根据金、彭两将军的复信，邀请对方联络官于九月二十四日上午十时在板门店洽商在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间。九时三十分对方联络官以无线电话通知我方，同意于上午十时在板门店举行双方联络官会议。上午十时我方联络官张春山上校，柴成文中校与对方联络官肯尼上校及穆莱上校，在板门店会晤。经过双方讨论后，决定在开城会场进行会谈。会谈开始后，我方联络官张春山上校建议立即进入关于在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间的洽商，但肯尼上校却提出了早已为金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员所根本拒绝讨论的所谓复会的条件。张春山上校当即严词指出，金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员已经明白声明：为了避免妨碍停战谈判的进行，应即在开城恢复谈判，而将未了事件及规定和保证开城区中立化的严格的协议，由双方代表团协议组成的适当机构去处理。我方联络官仅被授权来洽商在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间。肯尼上校旋即答称：联合国军联络官不仅被授权讨论复会的日期与时间，且亦被授权讨论其他有关复会的条件。并建议在九月二十五日上午十时再行举行联络官会议。张春山上校再度声明为了迅速恢复举世人民所企望的停战谈判，对方联络官应即洽商在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间。九月廿四日下午六时张春山上校在板门店送交对方联络官备忘录一份，根据我方首席代表的命令，具体建议双方代表在九月二十五日上午十时正式恢复停战谈判会议。备忘录全文如下：
    张春山致肯尼备忘录：“我已经将今日上午我与你会谈的经过，报告我方首席代表。我方首席代表再度强调指出金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员的致李奇微将军信中曾一再指出，恢复开城停战谈判为举世人民所切望，开城停战谈判应立即恢复，而无需再去讨论恢复谈判的条件。关于未了事件和规定具体的严格的而又为双方满意的使开城区中立化的条件，则可在开城谈判恢复的第一次会议上由双方协议组织一个机构去处理，联络官无权处理此类问题。我亦不准备和你讨论任何有关此类问题，我只被授权和你洽商在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间。鉴于你在今日的联络官会议中曾经声明你方也愿意讨论恢复谈判日期和时间，我奉我首席代表之命，建议双方代表在九月二十五日上午十时复会，请你立即报告你方首席代表，并望你在明日上午十时以前给予答复。如果在明日十时以前我方仍未取得你方的同意的答复，则我将在明日十时和你会晤，继续讨论在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间，并仅仅讨论在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间。”
