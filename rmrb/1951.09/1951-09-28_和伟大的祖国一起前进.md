    Advancing with the Great Motherland
    Lou Bangyan, Professor of Political Science, Peking University

    It has been more than thirty months since Beijing was liberated, and the People's Republic of China is now a full two years old. In these days, I have seen and heard many people I had never seen or heard before, and countless things I had never imagined. The country, which was once an abstract concept to me, has now become a concrete, great motherland that I wholeheartedly love. Like everything new around me, a new me is also being created. In this process of creation, the old will die, and the new will grow, so the process of creation is inevitably also a process of struggle. For more than two years, I have fought many hard battles in my mind. When I broke free from an old idea, I felt a sense of liberation and excitement. Now, I am still fighting hard battles. The vigorous future of the great motherland gives me the courage and confidence to constantly strive to break free from all old ideas and liberate myself.

    I used to be a naive person, which was determined by my background and the education I received in the past. After coming to Beijing in 1946, I saw the world, and I suddenly realized that in the world we live in, fierce struggles are universally happening and unfolding in every corner. People at the time called Peking University a "semi-liberated area." Right here, I personally experienced many struggles of young students and revolutionary intellectuals. In these struggles, I was moved, I threw myself into these struggles in different ways, and I also said a lot of words that were enough to provoke the reactionary rulers to persecute me. This does not mean that I was very revolutionary from that time on. Not at all. Because I received a colonial education in the Shanghai concession since I was a child, and then received a long-term bourgeois education, although the oppression of imperialism often aroused my hatred for imperialism, I was still immersed in bourgeois democracy. I must admit that before liberation, I was basically a reformist. This is manifested in: although I scolded Chiang Kai-shek's rule, what I was hoping for was only a political situation in which the Communist Party could exist legally on the surface, but the power was actually controlled by a small number of people. The deep-rooted poison of bourgeois education limited my ability to understand the issues of revolution, political power, and imperialism from a class perspective. I never seriously thought about the truth that Chairman Mao once pointed out: "All middle forces, if they do not belong to this side, belong to that side." I was blinded by the disguised neutrality and vainly pursued a "third road" that did not exist at all.

    Countless new things in the new country appeared before our eyes, making me wake up as if from a nightmare. I was pulled from the sky to the ground. Like many intellectuals influenced by bourgeois education, I used to be detached from reality, and therefore detached from the masses. I never cared about what kind of society China was, but instead worshiped some deceptive tricks of foreign bourgeois rulers in politics. Thus, I believed that the methods used by foreign bourgeois rulers to enslave the people could be moved to China without any changes to solve China's problems. As a result, I disregarded the class essence of political power, mistakenly praised the superficial phenomenon of "party politics" under bourgeois democracy, and vaguely believed that laying down weapons to reason with the reactionary ruling class and slowly persuading them was an effective approach, without knowing that this was tantamount to surrendering, succumbing, and willingly accepting slavery. Everything in the new country has educated me, made me realize the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and made me understand that only by targeting China's social reality is it a path we can take. In the past, I had unrealistically said some beautiful words, or stood aside and said some sarcastic remarks, seriously committing the mistakes of foreign dogmatism and objectivism.

    In the past two years, I have had several opportunities to study in different forms. Political study at the beginning of liberation was one kind, studying at the North China People's Revolutionary University was another kind; in addition, I also participated in the East China Land Reform Visiting Group and the Ding County Special District Inspection Team in Hebei Province. These opportunities made it possible for me to recognize myself and criticize my past incorrect thoughts. These opportunities also allowed me to personally experience the vigorous anti-feudal struggle and patriotic production increase movement of the peasant masses. I came into contact with reality, and therefore truly came into contact with the masses. I felt my own insignificance and discovered this truth: without the masses, everything will fall through. In this spirit, I sought to improve my relationship with my classmates and colleagues, so that my teaching gradually achieved better results. In the same spirit, in addition to pure teaching, I also participated in various mass movements and actively strived to do some mass work, first of all trade union work. On the surface, the time I spent on narrow professional work was obviously reduced, but what I learned in mass work was many extremely valuable things that could not be learned elsewhere. I fully believe that if I cannot go deep into the broad masses and throw myself into every movement, I will never be able to grasp reality, never be able to practice in person, and I will remain a useless person despite being full of dogma.

    "The changes are developing so fast that many people feel sudden and feel the need to relearn. This mood of people is understandable, and we welcome this kind and demanding attitude to relearn." I am one of the people Chairman Mao pointed out who once lingered over other things and today have awakened and are changing their minds. I must thank the Communist Party for the education it has given me directly and indirectly, and I must also thank the comrades for their warm encouragement and help. All of this gives me greater courage to fight against the dark side of my thinking, constantly transform myself, and train myself to be a more useful person to the motherland in my current or future positions, until I am a comprehensive fighter for the cause of communism.

    Advancing with the great motherland! This is the path for each of us.

### 和伟大的祖国一起前进

专栏：庆祝建国两周年

    和伟大的祖国一起前进
    北大政治系教授  楼邦彦
    北京已解放了三十多个月，中华人民共和国也整整两周岁了。在这些日子里，我看到听到不少过去从未看到听到过的人和无数过去从未想像到的事。过去对我曾是一个抽象的国家，现在已变成具体的、伟大的、使我衷心热爱的祖国了。如同四周围一切新的东西，一个新的我也正在创造中。在这个创造的过程中，旧的将死亡，新的在滋长，因此创造的过程必然同时也是斗争的过程。两年多以来，我曾经在思想上打过不少苦仗，当我从一个旧的思想里挣脱出来时，我所感到的是一种被解放的兴奋愉快的情绪。现在，我也还在打着苦仗，伟大祖国的蓬勃前途给予我勇气和信心，不断努力从一切旧的思想里挣脱，解放出来。
    我曾经是一个思想幼稚的人，这是我的出身和过去所受的教育所决定的。一九四六年来到北京以后，我看到了世界，我这才恍然认识到，在我们生活的世界里，普遍地在每一角落都发生而且展开着剧烈的斗争。人们在当时称北京大学为“半解放区”，就在这里，我亲身经历过许多次青年学生和革命知识分子的斗争。在这些斗争中，我受了感动，我以不同的方式投入了这些斗争，也曾讲了不少足以引起反动统治者对我迫害的话。这并不是说从那时起我就已经很革命了。完全不是这样。我因为自幼受了上海租界内的殖民地教育，往后又受了长期的资产阶级教育，尽管帝国主义的压迫往往激起我对帝国主义的痛恨，但我还是沉醉于资产阶级的民主。我应该承认，解放以前，我基本上是一个改良主义者。这表现在：我虽则痛骂过蒋介石的统治，但所企盼到临的只是一种共产党可以在表面上合法存在，而政权实际上还是操在少数人手中的政治局面。根深蒂固的资产阶级教育的毒素，限制了我以阶级的观点从本质上去了解关于革命、政权、国家、帝国主义等等的问题。我的确从未认真地思考过毛主席所曾指出的“一切中间势力，不附属于那一方面，就附属于这一方面”的道理，我为伪装的中立所蒙蔽，徒然落空地去追求一条根本不存在的“第三条道路”。
    新国家的无数新事物呈现在我们眼前，使我像从一场恶梦中惊醒过来一般。我从天空中被拉到地上来了。如同很多受了资产阶级教育影响的知识分子，我过去一向是脱离实际的，因而也是脱离群众的。我从不理会中国是怎样一个社会，反而去崇拜外国的资产阶级统治者在政治上的一些欺骗勾当，于是认为外国的资产阶级统治者用来奴役人民的一套办法，可以原封不动地搬到中国来解决中国的问题。其结果是：我漠视了政权的阶级本质，错误地颂扬资产阶级民主下的“政党政治”的表面现象，糊涂地认为放下武器去同反动统治阶级讲道理、慢慢地进行说服是一个有效的做法，而不知道这无异是投降、屈服、甘受奴役。新国家的一切教育了我，使我认识到把马列主义普遍真理和中国革命实际结合起来的毛泽东思想的伟大，使我明白了只有针对着中国的社会实际，才是我们一条走得通的道路。过去我曾不切实际地说过一些漂亮话，或站在一边地说过一些风凉话，严重地犯了洋教条主义和客观主义的毛病。
    在两年中，我得到好几次不同形式的学习机会。初解放时的政治学习是一种，进华北人民革命大学学习又是一种；此外，我还参加了华东区土地改革参观团和河北省定县专区视察组等工作。这些机会使我有可能认识自己并批判过去的不正确思想，这些机会又使我亲身体会了农民群众的轰轰烈烈的反封建斗争和爱国丰产运动。我接触到了实际，因此也就真正接触到了群众。我感到自己的渺小，发现了这一条道理：离开了群众，一切将都会落空。我本着这个精神，来求我和同学与同事间的关系的改进，从而使我的教学逐步得到了更好的效果。我本着同样的精神，在单纯的教学以外，又参加到各种群众运动中去，并积极争取做一些群众工作，首先是工会工作。在表面上看，我从事于狭义业务的时间显然是减少了，但我在群众工作中所学习到的，却是在别处所学习不到的许多极其宝贵的东西。我完全相信，我若不能深入广大群众中去，投入每一运动中去，我将永远不能掌握实际，永远不能亲身实践，我将尽管满腹教条而永远是一个无用的人。
    “事变是发展得这样快，以至使很多人感到突然，感到要重新学习。人们的这种心情是可以理解的，我们欢迎这种善良的要求重新学习的态度。”我就是毛主席所指出的曾经留恋过别的东西、今天已经觉悟过来而正在换脑筋的人们中的一个。我必须感谢共产党直接间接给予我的教育，也必须感谢同志们的热情的鼓励与帮助。所有这些使我具有更大的勇气，来同我思想的黑暗面作斗争，不断改造自己，把自己锻炼成在目前或在将来其他岗位上一个对祖国更有用的人，直至一个全面的为共产主义事业而奋斗的战士。
    和伟大的祖国一起前进！这是我们每一个人的道路。
