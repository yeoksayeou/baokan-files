(Xinhua News Agency, 21st) In the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our heavy industry has been restored and developed on a dilapidated foundation. Many pieces of equipment that were destroyed or shelved for years have been repaired and put into production. The imbalances in equipment within enterprises have been changed, and the production capacity of various factories and mines has been greatly improved. Two enterprises near the capital have increased their production to two to three times the highest output during the period of Japanese occupation and Kuomintang rule due to improved equipment utilization rates. In 1950, the major products of the national state-owned heavy industry departments all exceeded their planned targets. The total annual output value of twenty-one major products increased by 2.25 times compared to 1949. Among them, the steel industry increased by 294 percent, the non-ferrous metals industry increased by 190 percent, the chemical industry increased by 90 percent, the electrical appliance industry increased by 289 percent, and the machinery industry increased by 241 percent. In the first half of 1951, the total output value of the above industries (plus the building materials industry) reached 103 percent of the planned target, accounting for 72.2 percent of the total value for the entire year of 1950, and exceeding the same period last year by 44 percent.

Several factories or products have already exceeded previous highest annual production records. For example, a certain steel plant's pig iron production in 1950 exceeded the previous highest annual production by 79.5 percent, and in 1951, it will exceed it by 300 percent. A certain cement plant had already exceeded its target by 1 percent in 1949 (actually eight months), exceeded it by 221 percent last year, and will exceed it by 248 percent this year.

In the past two years, our heavy industry has produced a large number of products to meet the needs of industrial, transportation, and farmland water conservancy construction, and has created many new products, becoming an important force for the recovery and development of our industry and agriculture.

Railway steel rails, which had never been produced during the Kuomintang rule, were manufactured in the people's steel plants in the first year of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan had longed for for forty years, has begun to be laid with their own steel rails and was opened to traffic between Chongqing and Yongchuan on September 1 this year.

The development of industry directly depends on the increase in machinery industry production. Since liberation, our machinery industry has no longer been limited to repairing or manufacturing small machines. This year, China has begun to manufacture complete sets of textile machinery for the first time, and this year's products can supply half of the machinery needed for new textile units this year, and the entire amount can be replenished by the first quarter of next year. This is a great joyous event in the history of Chinese machinery manufacturing. The successful manufacturing of automobiles by the Tianjin Automotive Assembly Plant on the 19th of this month is another joyous event. According to incomplete materials, the machinery industry has manufactured more than 270 important new products in the past two years. For example, electric motors, which could only be made at 300 horsepower in the past, can now be made at 1,000 horsepower; transformers, which could only be made at 2,000 kVA in the past, can now be made at 6,000 kVA. Tractors, track motorcycles (for railways), drilling rigs, steel wire recorders, train air brakes, small locomotives, etc., which were not produced in the past, can now be manufactured. The quality of many products has improved. Soviet experts who have come to China believe that many products in Shanghai are sufficient to be ranked as world-class without inferiority. For example, the precision of one of the new products, the universal grinder, has reached the international standard of one hundred thousandth of an inch.

With the increase in output and quality, the cost of various products has been continuously reduced. For example, the price of cement used to be equivalent to a bag of flour for every 85 kilograms of cement, but last year the price for cement orders was reduced by 30 percent.

In the past, complex sluice gate components were never manufactured domestically. However, in order to cooperate with the country's water conservancy construction and to save the tens of millions of farmers on both sides of the Huai River from perennial flooding, more than 100 steel, machinery, and hardware factories in Shanghai accepted the arduous task of manufacturing the flood control sluice gate components for the Huai River. The components of this sluice gate are massive and very complex. The four-ton hydraulic press used to control the switches alone requires 168 sets. As a result, all the components were manufactured and installed on schedule before the flood. The Huai River farmers who had not harvested a crop for eight years were able to eat the grain they grew this year, which is inseparable from the huge contributions made by heavy industry. Agricultural tool factories and machine factories in various regions have produced many waterwheels and agricultural machinery to supply farmers to improve production. In the spring and summer of last year, the Northeast region manufactured more than 59,300 new-style agricultural implements. The North China directly affiliated factories of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry produced more than 11,900 waterwheels for farmers from last year to this year. The Second Factory of the Jinan Industrial Bureau also manufactured more than 10,000 Liberation-style waterwheels in the one-year period from March of last year to April of this year. Chemical factories and pesticide factories in various regions are actively producing chemical fertilizers and pesticides for farmers. This spring alone, the cooperatives in North China, East China, Central South, and Northwest China supplied farmers with 10,000 tons of chemical fertilizers. Last year, more than 30 kinds of chemical pesticides were promoted throughout the country, totaling more than 1,380 tons. In the suburbs of Beijing, the use of pesticides to control vegetable pests on tens of thousands of acres has achieved significant results. This year, the production volume of chemical pesticides has increased in various regions. The arsenic mines in Hunan Province alone can produce more than 20,000 dan of red sodium this year to control underground pests.

The People's New China is not only vigorously carrying out the recovery work of heavy industry, but also has begun several new constructions with emphasis. In order to meet the needs of national defense construction and economic construction, large-scale factories and mines will appear successively in the next few years.

(Xinhua News Agency, 23rd) In the past two years, the national light industry has achieved some development from adjustment and reorganization. According to past market rules, the first half of the year is generally considered the off-season, but this rule has begun to be broken in the first half of this year. Compared with the second half of last year, the output of various light industries has increased in the first half of this year. Automobile tires increased by 99 percent, rubber shoes increased by 55 percent, paper making increased by 25 percent, industrial belting leather increased by 43 percent, and machine-made sugar increased by 21.5 percent. The firecracker industry, which once had serious sluggish sales last year, has seen a general increase in output in various regions in the first half of this year. East China and Tianjin have increased to more than 300 percent. Other industries such as cultural, educational, instrumentation, and daily necessities have developed more vigorously this year. Taking Shanghai as an example, the average monthly output of fountain pens last year was about 110,000 dozens, and the production and sales volume has reached 400,000 dozens in July and August this year. In the enamel industry, the production and sales volume of washbasins in the first half of this year have increased by more than 60 percent compared with last year. The output of flashlight, thermos bottle, soap, and household chemical product industries has also increased significantly.

In addition to the increase in output, public and private light industries in various regions have also made some achievements in improving quality and reducing costs. In the past two years, the tensile strength, break rate, and whiteness of domestically produced roll paper have been improved. The quality of automobile tires is also constantly improving. The quality of industrial belting leather and textile leather is relatively high, which used to rely on foreign supply, but now it can basically be self-sufficient. The quality of firecrackers in various regions has been significantly improved in terms of waste stems, break rate, and ignition point after the implementation of the inspection system. The production cost of the factories under the Paper Industry Management Office of the Central Ministry of Light Industry decreased by an average of 2.34 percent in the first half of 1951, and the ten factories under the Tianjin Public Industry Administration Bureau reduced their costs by an average of 5.32 percent throughout last year.

The basic reasons for such recovery and development of light industry are the increased purchasing power of farmers after the land reform and the increased needs of economic construction and national defense construction.

These achievements are also inseparable from the high enthusiasm of the working class. After the movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and democratic reform, workers in various regions have signed patriotic pacts and launched labor competitions.

Light industrial workers in the Northeast enthusiastically responded to the call of Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, to increase production and save resources for the country, which is equivalent to 5 million tons of grain. The workers of the First Branch of the Sixth Paper Mill improved the mechanical equipment, changing from reverse pulping to forward pulping, which greatly improved the quality, with first-class products accounting for 90 percent, the paper machine speed increased, and the output also increased. Zhang Wenfu's team at the Liaoxi Changbei Oil Factory created a new record of 13.9 kilograms of oil per 100 kilograms of soybeans in August. Zhang Shuyun, a female worker at the Tianjin Hengda Cigarette Factory, concentrated the wisdom of the masses and created new working methods, which greatly improved production efficiency. The working class in Shanghai has also created many brilliant achievements in the patriotic labor competition.

In the case of a large increase in the need for light industrial products, some regions have found that some light industrial products cannot meet the demand. Therefore, light industrial enterprises in various regions are expanding or building new ones. Especially after the National Industrial Conference this spring, the enthusiasm of various regions for investing in local industry has greatly increased, and most provinces and cities in the major administrative regions of the country are generally developing local industry. For example, Shanxi Province has nearly 20 new factories under construction or being planned this year. Each special zone in Guangdong Province is preparing to build rosin, oil pressing, sugar making, sack, and pulp factories this year. Investment companies and private capitalists in various regions are also gradually increasing their investment in light industry. For example, Beijing Xingye Investment Company and Tianjin Investment Company have successively invested in the operation of Yili Food Factory and Shoufeng Flour Factory. Many cotton yarn businesses in Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places have recently changed their business to invest in light industrial production such as papermaking, cultural and educational products, food, and nail making. Many small, poorly equipped, and long-dormant private paper mills in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have recently been restoring and expanding their equipment.

At present, China's light industry has the conditions for further recovery and partial development. However, in order to lay the foundation for the development of light industry and prepare for large-scale construction in the future, public and private light industries across the country must steadily move forward under the planned leadership of the People's Government, avoid blindness, and in the current situation where the supply of raw materials for light industry is still difficult, it is necessary to increase the production of raw materials and save the use of raw materials, and pay attention to the processing and utilization of domestic local and special products, so that China's light industry can gradually move towards a path of self-reliance, independence, and prosperity.

    工人阶级积极生产加强国防恢复经济
    我国工业建设两年来成就辉煌
    重工业已能制造许多过去中国从未制造过的产品
    轻工业产量和质量都大为增进并纷纷扩充或新建
    【新华社二十一日讯】在中华人民共和国成立后的两年中，我国重工业已在残破的基础之上恢复发展起来。许多被破坏或多年搁置的设备已经修复生产；企业内部某些设备上的不平衡现象已经改变，因而各厂矿的生产能力都大为提高。首都附近的两个企业，由于设备利用率提高，生产已超过日寇和国民党统治时期最高产量二倍到三倍。一九五○年，全国国营重工业部门的主要产品都超额完成了计划。二十一种主要产品的年产总值和一九四九年比较，增加了二点二五倍，其中钢铁工业增加百分之二百九十四，有色金属工业增加百分之一百九十，化学工业增加百分之九十，电器工业增加百分之二百八十九，机器工业增加百分之二百四十一。一九五一年上半年，上述各业（另加建筑材料工业）的产量总值，达预定计划的百分之一百零三，为一九五○年全年总值的百分之七十二点二，与去年同期相较则超过百分之四十四。
    若干工厂或产品已经超过了以往的最高年产纪录。例如某钢铁厂的生铁产量一九五○年即超过过去最高年产量百分之七十九点五，而在一九五一年将超过百分之三百。某水泥厂在一九四九年（实际是八个月）即已超过百分之一，去年则超过百分之二百二十一，今年将超过百分之二百四十八。
    两年来，我国重工业针对工业、交通建设和农田水利建设的需要生产了大量产品，并创造出许多新产品，成为我国工业和农业赖以恢复发展的一个重要力量。
    铁道钢轨，在国民党统治时期从未制作过，但是仅仅在中华人民共和国成立的第一年中就在人民的钢铁厂里生产出来。四川人民渴望四十年的成渝铁路，已经用自己的钢轨开始铺设，并于今年九月一日在重庆永川之间通车。
    工业的发展直接依赖于机器工业生产的提高。解放以来，我国机器工业已不是只能修理或制造小机器了。今年我国已经第一次开始制造全套纺织机械，并且今年的产品就可以供应本年度新建纺织单位所需机器的半数，到明年第一季就可全部补足。这是中国机械制造史上的一件大喜事。本月十九日天津汽车制配厂自制汽车成功，又是另一件喜事。根据不完全的材料，机器业在两年来已制造了二百七十多种重要的新产品。例如：电动机，过去只能做三百马力的，现在已能做一千马力的；变压器，过去只能做两千千伏安的，现在已能做六千千伏安的。过去没有生产过的拖拉机、查道摩托车（铁路用）、探钻机、钢丝录音机、火车风闸、小火车头等现在都可以制造了。许多产品的质量已有提高。来到中国的苏联专家认为上海的许多产品足以列入世界第一流而无逊色。如新产品之一的万能磨床，精密度已经达到十万分之一吋的国际标准。
    随着产量与质量的提高，各种产品的成本已在不断地降低。如水泥价格过去一直是八十五公斤水泥相当一袋面粉，而在去年水泥订货的价格就降低了百分之三十。
    过去国内从来没有制造过复杂的水闸机件，但是为了配合国家的水利建设，为了使淮河两岸连年受灾的一千几百万农民免于水患，上海一百多家钢铁、机器、五金工厂接受了制造淮河防洪水闸机件的艰巨任务。这个水闸的机件是大量的而且是很复杂的。仅用来管开关的四吨重的油压机就需要一百六十八套。结果，全部机件如期在洪水前制好并安装完毕。已经八年没有收过秋的淮河农民今年能够吃到自己种的粮食，是和重工业所作巨大贡献分不开的。各地农具制造厂和机器工厂生产了许多水车、农业机械，供应农民提高生产。去年春夏两季东北区就制造了新式农具五万九千三百多件。中央重工业部华北直属工厂从去年到今年，为农民生产了水车一万一千九百多辆。济南工业局第二厂在去年三月到今年四月的一年多中，也制造了解放式水车一万多辆。各地化学工厂和农药厂积极地为农民生产化学肥料和农药等。今春只经过华北、华东、中南、西北各地合作社供应农民的化学肥料就有一万吨。去年全国曾推广化学农药三十余种，总数在一千三百八十吨以上。北京郊区一带使用农药防治蔬菜害虫数万亩，已收到显著效果。今年各地化学农药的生产量都有增加，只湖南省的砒矿，今年就可以生产治地下害虫的红钠二万余担。
    人民新中国不仅大力进行着重工业的恢复工作，而且已经有重点地开始了若干新建设。为了适应国防建设和经济建设的需要，规模宏大的厂矿即将在今后数年内陆续出现。
    【新华社二十三日讯】两年来全国轻工业已从调整改组中取得了部分的发展。依照过去市场规律，上半年一般是所谓淡季，但今年上半年这一规律已经开始打破。和去年下半年比较，今年上半年各种轻工业产量都有增加。计汽车轮胎增加了百分之九十九，胶鞋增加百分之五十五，造纸增加百分之二十五，工业用轮带革增加百分之四十三，机制糖增加百分之二十一点五，去年滞销情况一度很严重的火柴工业今年上半年各地的产量都普遍增加。华东区和天津都增加到百分之三百以上。其他如文教、仪器、日用品等工业，今年更蓬勃发展。以上海市为例，去年自来水笔产量平均每月十一万打左右，今年七、八月间产销量已达到四十万打。搪瓷工业中面盆的产销量今年上半年都较去年增加百分之六十以上。手电筒、热水瓶、肥皂、家用化学品工业等产量也都有显著增加。
    除了产量增加外，各地公私营轻工业在质量的提高和成本的降低上亦有了一些成绩。两年来，国产卷筒纸的拉力、断头率和白度都有改进。汽车轮胎的质量亦不断提高。工业用轮带革及纺织用革的品质较高，过去向赖国外供应，现在基本上已能自给。各地火柴品质，自执行检验制度后，在废梗、断头率、发火点各方面都有显著的改进。中央轻工业部造纸工业管理处所属各厂生产成本一九五一年上半年平均降低百分之二点三四，天津公营工业管理局所辖十个工厂去年全年平均降低成本百分之五点三二。
    轻工业得到这样的恢复和发展，基本原因是土地改革后农民购买力提高，以及经济建设和国防建设的需要增加。
    这些成就也是和工人阶级劳动热情的高涨不可分开的。经过了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、民主改革等运动，各地工人纷纷签订了爱国公约，开展了劳动竞赛。
    东北轻工业工人热烈响应了东北人民政府主席高岗为国家增产节约等于五百万吨粮食财富的号召。造纸六厂一分厂工人改进了机械设备，由过去的逆上浆改为正上浆，使质量大为提高，一等品占到百分之九十，抄纸车速提高了，产量也增加了。辽西昌北制油厂张文富小组在八月份创造了每百斤大豆出油十三斤九两的新纪录。天津恒大烟厂女工张淑云集中了群众智慧，创造了新的工作方法，使生产效率大为提高。上海工人阶级在爱国主义劳动竞赛中也创造了许多光辉的成绩。
    在轻工业品需要大量增加的情况下，各地已发现某些轻工业品供不应求的现象。因此，各地轻工业企业正在纷纷扩充或新建，尤其在今春全国工业会议以后，各地对地方工业投资积极性更大为高涨，全国各大行政区多数省市正普遍发展地方工业。如山西省今年新建和正在筹建的新厂就有近二十个单位。广东省各专区今年筹备新建的就有松香、榨油、制糖、麻袋、纸浆等厂。各地投资公司及私人资本家对轻工业的投资亦正在逐渐增加，如北京兴业投资公司、天津投资公司已先后投资经营义利食品厂和寿丰面粉厂等。上海、武汉等地许多棉纱商业最近都纷纷改业投资造纸、文教、食品、制钉等轻工业生产。上海、天津等地许多小型的设备不全停顿已久的私营造纸厂最近都在恢复和扩充设备。
    目前中国轻工业已经具备了进一步恢复和局部发展的条件。但为了奠定轻工业发展的基础并为今后大规模的建设作好准备工作，全国公私营轻工业还必须在人民政府有计划的领导下，稳步前进，避免盲目性。在目前轻工业原材料供应尚有困难的情况下，必须增加原材料的生产和节约原材料的使用，并注意国内土、特产的加工利用，使中国轻工业能逐渐走向自力更生，独立繁荣的道路。
