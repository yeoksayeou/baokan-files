    The North China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition is actively preparing. From the current progress of the exhibition's preparatory work, it can be seen that the exhibition will directly and comprehensively promote material exchange between urban and rural areas, between provinces, between North China and other major administrative regions, and between domestic and foreign entities this autumn and winter and next spring. The exhibition will feature seventeen pavilions, including industrial and commercial improvement, inter-regional (exhibiting products from provinces outside North China), material exchange services, agricultural production materials, agricultural improvement, mountain dried and fresh goods, medicines, aquatic products, animal products, economic crops, grain, cotton, cotton textiles, overcoming disasters, handicrafts, daily necessities, and heavy industry. In these pavilions, one can systematically see the landscape of material exchange in North China and the output, production period, origin, use, specifications, prices, and sales channels of various agricultural and sideline products and local specialties. The agricultural product pavilions will use various physical objects, examples, and charts to illustrate the achievements and experiences in promoting improved varieties, improving agricultural techniques, and overcoming disasters.
    In order to organize large-scale transactions through the exhibition, the preparatory committee has established a material exchange committee. The transaction amount is expected to reach one trillion yuan. The Material Exchange Committee is currently actively carrying out various preparatory works. In addition to formulating specific measures to simplify taxation with the Tianjin Tax Bureau, they have also convened symposiums with various industries together with the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, calling on and helping them formulate sales plans. Currently, ninety-eight industry units have submitted purchase and sales plans to the conference, with a total value of over 4.4 trillion yuan. The banking sector has also been mobilized to serve the conference transactions. They will add three temporary sub-offices, fifteen service stations, and several mobile service stations. Various preparatory works for organizing transactions are also underway in the provinces of North China. Shanxi Province has submitted purchase and sales plans worth more than 360 billion yuan to the conference. Other provinces will also submit purchase and sales plans soon. The preparatory committee has also invited major administrative regions to send trade delegations to Tianjin to organize material exchanges on a national scale.
    The conference venue is located at the Tianjin Racecourse, covering an area of approximately 20,000 square meters.

    华北区城乡物资交流展览会正积极筹备
    准备通过展览会组织大规模的交易
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会正在积极筹备中。从目前大会正进行中的筹备工作情况中，可以看出展览会将直接而全面地推动今年秋冬两季和明年春天城乡之间、各省之间、华北地区和其他大行政区之间以及国内外的物资交流工作。展览会筹设工商业改进、区际（展览华北区以外的各省产品）、物资交流服务、农业生产资料、农业改进、山干鲜货、药物、水产、畜产、经济农作物、粮食、棉花、棉织品、战胜灾害、手工业、日用品、重工业等十七个展览馆。在这些展览馆中可以系统地看到华北、内蒙物资交流的面貌，各种农业副业产品和土产特产品的产量、产期、产地、用途、规格、价格和销路等情况。各农产品展览馆将用各种实物、实例和图表说明推广优良品种，提高农作技术，战胜灾害的成绩和经验。
    为了通过展览会组织大规模的交易，筹备委员会特设立物资交流委员会。交易额准备争取达到一万亿元。物资交流委员会现正积极进行各种准备工作。他们除与天津税务局拟定了简化税收的具体办法外，还会同天津市工商业联合会、天津市人民政府工商局召集了各行业的座谈会，号召和帮助他们制定推销计划。现已有九十八个行业单位将购销计划送交大会，这些购销计划总值达四万四千余亿元。银行界也已动员起来为大会交易服务。他们将加设临时分理处三处，服务站十五处及若干流动服务站。华北区各省为组织成交的各项准备工作也正在紧张进行中。山西省已将三千六百多亿元的购销计划送到大会。其他各省最近也可将购销计划送来。筹委会还邀请各大行政区派遣贸易代表团到天津，以便在全国范围内组织物资交流。
    大会会址设天津跑马场，占地约两万平方米。
