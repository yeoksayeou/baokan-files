Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army combat heroes' delegation to the National Day celebration was warmly welcomed by the people of both Korea and China along the way as they returned home from the front lines of Korea.

In a certain place in Korea, a pear vendor, upon seeing that Kang Hanting, a model health worker from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, was wearing the "Military Service Medal" awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, immediately rushed to shake his hand and offered him pears to eat. In a certain village, an old man in his sixties treated the honored guests with great hospitality. He specially went to the field to get potatoes and peppers, and the old woman took out her treasured peppercorns to cook for the heroes. When the Volunteer Army heroes wanted to pay for the vegetables, the old man refused to accept, gesturing at the house and saying, "If it weren't for you, we wouldn't even have a house to live in!" Only after the heroes repeatedly explained did the old man accept two hundred Korean won.

After returning to the motherland, the heroes were even more warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the motherland. At the welcome party held by people from all walks of life in Northeast China, Zhang Xiushan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, praised the Volunteer Army heroes as "meritorious servants of peace-loving people all over the world" in his welcoming speech. Mr. Guan Mengjue, representative of various democratic parties in the Northeast region, said: "The heroes' arrival in Beijing will add glory to the National Day and glory to the Chinese people." At the welcoming banquet, Ma Chunyu, a combat hero of the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, raised his glass to toast the Volunteer Army heroes and expressed his desire to learn from the Volunteer Army's patriotism and internationalism, and that he was prepared to contribute everything he had to defend the great motherland whenever the country needed him.

    志愿军英雄代表团归国途中备受欢迎
    【新华社二十七日讯】中国人民志愿军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表团自朝鲜前线返国时，沿途受到朝中人民的热情欢迎。
    朝鲜某地一个卖梨的小贩看到志愿军某部模范卫生员康汉廷佩有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国赠予的“军功章”时，马上争着和他握手，并请他吃梨。某里一位六十多岁的老大爷殷勤款待贵宾。他特地跑到地里弄来马铃薯、辣椒，老大娘并拿出珍藏的花椒给英雄们做菜。志愿军英雄们要付给菜钱时，老大爷拒绝接受，他比量着房子说：“要是没有你们，我们连房子也住不成了！”英雄们一再解释后，老大爷才收下二百元朝鲜币。
    英雄们回到祖国后，更受到祖国各界人民的热烈欢迎。东北各界人民欢迎晚会上，人民解放军东北军区张秀山副政委在致欢迎词中称誉志愿军英雄们是“全世界爱好和平人民的功臣”。东北区各民主党派代表关梦觉先生说：“英雄们到北京，将为国庆节增添光荣，将为中国人民增添光荣。”欢宴会上，人民解放军东北军区战斗英雄马春雨举杯向志愿军英雄们致敬，并表示要好好学习志愿军的爱国主义与国际主义精神，当祖国需要的时候，他准备随时为保卫伟大的祖国而贡献出个人的一切。
