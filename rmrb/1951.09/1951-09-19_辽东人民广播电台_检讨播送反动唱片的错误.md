Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Liaodong People's Broadcasting Station
    Self-Criticism for Broadcasting Reactionary Records
    To the Editors:
    The People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page on August 29th published Comrade Wang Qi's criticism of our station's broadcasting of the reactionary Peking opera record "Zhu Lian Zhai" on August 15th. We sincerely accept this criticism.
    Last May and June, our station's editorial department, in accordance with the Central Broadcasting Administration's instructions regarding the broadcasting of Peking opera records, conducted a review of all old opera records. That review was not thorough enough, and some Peking opera records that should not have been broadcast (such as "Zhu Lian Zhai") were not weeded out and continued to be broadcast. This shows that we still lack a serious and responsible attitude towards the people's broadcasting undertaking.
    After reading Comrade Wang Qi's comments, we immediately convened a meeting of all comrades in the editorial department to conduct a self-examination. We have identified several ways to improve our work: (1) To conduct a study and discussion of the initial review results throughout the station, and then, in conjunction with the work of each department, conduct a comprehensive review. (2) To thoroughly re-examine all existing Peking opera records. We will compile a list of records that we do not understand and submit them to the Provincial Department of Culture and Education for review. Other records, such as Western music, will also undergo a thorough review. (3) The comrades responsible for managing records must strengthen their professional studies. The broadcasting team must make the study and research of record content a regular part of their professional learning.

### 辽东人民广播电台  检讨播送反动唱片的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    辽东人民广播电台
    检讨播送反动唱片的错误编辑同志：
    八月二十九日人民日报“读者来信专页”登载了王岐同志对于我台八月十五日播送的内容反动的京剧唱片“珠帘寨”的批评，我们诚恳接受。
    去年五、六月间，我台编辑科曾按照中央广播事业局关于播送京剧唱片的指示，把所有旧剧唱片进行过一次检查。那次检查不够澈底，有些不应播的京剧唱片（如珠帘寨）并没有被检查出去，还在继续播送。这说明我们对人民广播事业还缺乏认真负责的态度。
    看了王歧同志的意见，我们立即召开编辑科全体同志会议，进行检查。确定了若干改进工作的办法：（一）把初步检查结果，在全台进行一次学习讨论，再结合各科工作，作一次普遍检查。（二）把现有的京剧唱片澈底进行清查一次。把我们不懂的唱片，列出清单，送交省文教厅审查。其他西乐等唱片，也要进行一次澈底清查。（三）负责管理唱片的同志要加强业务学习。播音组要把研究及学习唱片内容，作为经常业务学习内容之一。
