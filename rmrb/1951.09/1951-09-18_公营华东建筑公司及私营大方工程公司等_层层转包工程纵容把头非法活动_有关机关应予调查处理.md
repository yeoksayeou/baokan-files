    State-owned Huadong Construction Company and Private Dafang Construction Company, etc.
    Subcontracting Projects at Multiple Levels and Conniving with Foremen in Illegal Activities - Relevant Authorities Should Investigate and Deal with This

    The construction project of a certain factory in Taiyuan City is mostly undertaken by the state-owned Huadong Construction Company, the private Dafang Construction Company, and private firms such as Bao Fuju and Xue Shunji. These construction companies and firms mostly came here from Shanghai and Nanjing. In the process of construction, they violated local government decrees and the collective contract between labor and management in the Taiyuan City construction industry, openly engaging in multi-layered subcontracting, causing serious losses to the state and subjecting workers to the feudal exploitation of foremen.

    The private ironworks Bao Fuju and Xue Shunji jointly contracted the cold work engineering (i.e., steel structure engineering) for the metalworking and forging workshops of a certain factory, with a contract price of approximately 1.8 billion yuan. However, the total capital of these two ironworks does not exceed 56 million yuan. Fearing that they would have difficulty completing the task due to insufficient funds, the owner entrusted the state-owned Huadong Construction Company to manage it on their behalf, paying 6% of the construction cost to Huadong Construction Company as management fees. Huadong Construction Company took the management fees but did not assume its due responsibilities, still allowing Bao Fuju and Xue Shunji to subcontract the project and engage in illegal exploitation. Bao Fuju and Xue Shunji subcontracted the riveting engineering, originally priced at 2.45 million yuan per ton, to Yang Julong, Qin Chang, Song Fuxin, and other three ironworks at 1.85 million yuan per ton; these three ironworks then subcontracted it to the workers at 700,000 yuan per ton. The projects undertaken by Huadong Construction Company itself were also not directly managed, but similarly subcontracted out. For example, rebar tying, concrete, and other projects were subcontracted to "large team leaders" Sheng Xiaogou, Zhang Atao, Gu Xiangbao, Shen Rulang, Luo Xihua, and others; the "large team leaders" then subcontracted these projects to "small team leaders" Tian Yongqian, Zhao Jingwen, Fu Zhaohong, Huang Gengsheng, Shen Xigen, and others. Workers under the Huadong Construction Company's Luo Xihua "large team" had to hand over 30,000 yuan to the "large team leader" for every one million yuan they earned in wages. Dafang Construction Company contracted carpentry work to Xu Longquan, originally estimated at 2,250 workdays, with a wage of 24,000 yuan per workday. After Xu Longquan contracted this project, he only used 1,900 workdays, making a huge profit of 8.4 million yuan. Zhou Bingyuan contracted Dafang Construction Company's project in Taiyuan, but he himself was in Nanjing, entrusting Shen Heshun to manage the Taiyuan project on his behalf. Zhuang Dehua has contracted projects in Nanjing, Wuhu, Tangshan, Yuci, and other places, and he himself never goes to the construction site to work.

    The above situation was discovered during our inspection. We hope to attract the attention of relevant authorities and ban all kinds of illegal activities in the construction industry.

    公营华东建筑公司及私营大方工程公司等
    层层转包工程纵容把头非法活动
    有关机关应予调查处理编辑同志：
    太原市某厂建设工程，大部分是由公营华东建筑公司、私营大方工程公司、以及私营鲍福记、薛顺记等厂商承做。这些建筑公司和厂商，多由上海、南京来此。他们在施工过程中，违反当地政府的法令及太原市建筑业劳资双方的集体合同，公然进行层层转包，使国家受到严重损失，使工人受着把头的封建剥削。
    私营鲍福记、薛顺记铁工厂联合承包某厂金工、锻工等厂房冷作工程（即钢铁结构工程），包价约十八亿元。但这两家铁工厂的资金总额并不超过五千六百万元。业主见到他们资金过少，恐难完成任务，便委托公营华东建筑公司代为管理，并以造价的百分之六交华东建筑公司作为管理费用。华东建筑公司拿了管理费用，并没有担负应负的责任，仍旧听任鲍福记、薛顺记将工程转包，进行非法剥削。鲍福记、薛顺记将原价二百四十五万元一吨的打铆钉工程，以每吨一百八十五万元转包给杨聚隆、勤昌、宋复鑫等三家铁工厂承做；这三家铁工厂又以每吨七十万元，包给了工人。华东建筑公司本身承做的工程，也不是直接经营管理，同样是转包出去。如扎铁、混凝土等工程，均分别转包给“大组长”盛小狗、张阿桃、顾祥宝、沈如郎、罗锡华等人；“大组长”又将这项工程转包给“小组长”田永谦、赵景文、傅兆红、黄根生、申喜根等人。华东建筑公司罗锡华“大组”的工人，每挣一百万元的工资，就得交给“大组长”三万元。私营大方工程公司包给许龙泉的木工，原估计二千二百五十个工，每工工资两万四千元。许龙泉包到此项工程后，只用了一千九百个工，获暴利八百四十万元。周炳元包了大方工程公司在太原的工程，但他本人却在南京，把太原的工程就托沈和顺代为掌管。庄德华在南京、芜湖、唐山、榆次等地都包有工程，自己根本不到工地劳动。
    以上情况，是我们在检查中发觉的。希望引起有关机关的重视，取缔建筑业中种种非法行为。
