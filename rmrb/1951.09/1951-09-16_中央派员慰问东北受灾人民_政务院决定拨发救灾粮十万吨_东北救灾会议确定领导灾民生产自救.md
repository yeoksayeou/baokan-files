    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th – The Central People's Government's Northeast Flood Disaster慰問团 (Comfort Mission), led by团长 (Head) Fu Zuoyi and副团长 (Deputy Head) Chen Qiyuan, with a total of 29 members, arrived in Shenyang on the 11th from Beijing and will go to various disaster areas in the coming days to comfort the disaster-stricken people. At the same time, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has decided to allocate 60,000 tons of relief grain and approved the allocation of 40,000 tons of relief grain by the Northeast People's Government, a total of 100,000 tons of grain, to relieve the disaster-stricken people in Northeast China and help them carry out production for self-relief. In addition, the China People's Relief Administration has also decided to allocate a large number of winter clothes to aid the disaster-stricken people in Northeast China.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th – In order to further relieve the people in the Liaoxi flood-stricken area, the Northeast People's Government recently convened a flood disaster relief conference. The conference decided that the future disaster relief policy is: under the organization and leadership of the government, the people in the disaster area will carry out production for self-relief; and all localities will mobilize social forces for mutual assistance. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, pointed out at the meeting: with the existing conditions in Northeast China, we can completely ensure that the people in the disaster area have food, clothing, and good production.

    The meeting considered that the people's governments and the military at all levels in the flood-stricken area have contributed to disaster relief. When the floods arrived, governments at all levels led the people to actively protect the dikes and relocate people in areas that might be flooded. The governments and military in the flood-stricken areas rescued 130,000 disaster victims from the floods and made proper arrangements for them. After the flood receded, the government led the people to drain water for planting vegetables, repair houses, dig for property, and collect agricultural tools, and has begun to lead the disaster victims to engage in sideline production and strive to salvage the autumn harvest of some of the still-recoverable fields. Therefore, the current disaster situation has stabilized. The Liaoxi Provincial People's Government has also formulated a production plan for the disaster victims. According to this plan, each disaster victim can produce a minimum of 300 jin of grain this winter and next spring.

    After discussing the disaster relief guidelines, policies, and organizational leadership work, the conference conducted meticulous research and made decisions on the issuance of loans, as well as the collection and distribution of relief materials such as grain, winter clothing, and lumber. The conference also emphasized that the disaster areas should further investigate the disaster situation, understand the living and production needs of the disaster victims, so as to provide effective relief. Cadres should deeply understand the ideological situation and difficulties of the disaster victims, conduct propaganda and education on production for self-relief among the disaster victims, and help them find solutions; the bureaucratic tendency of work not being thorough enough should be prevented and opposed.

    中央派员慰问东北受灾人民
    政务院决定拨发救灾粮十万吨
    东北救灾会议确定领导灾民生产自救
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】中央人民政府所派遣的东北水灾慰问团，在团长傅作义、副团长陈其瑗率领下，全团二十九人已于十一日由北京到达沈阳，日内即赴各灾区慰问受灾人民。同时，中央人民政府政务院已决定拨发救济粮六万吨，并批准由东北人民政府拨发救济粮四万吨，共十万吨粮食救济东北受灾人民，扶助他们进行生产自救。此外，中国人民救济总会亦决定拨发大批寒衣，援助东北受灾人民。
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】为进一步救济辽西水灾区人民，东北人民政府最近召开了水灾救济会议。会议决定的今后的救灾方针是：在政府的组织领导下，灾区人民生产自救；并由各地发动社会力量互助互济。东北人民政府林枫副主席在会上曾指出：以东北现有的条件来说，我们完全可以做到使灾区人民有吃有穿和搞好生产。
    会议认为：水灾区各级人民政府和军队对救灾都有功劳。洪水到来的时候，各级政府曾领导人民积极护堤，迁移可能被淹地区的人民。洪水成灾地区的政府和军队从洪水中共救出灾民十三万人，并且都作了妥善的安置。洪水一退，政府就领导人民进行排水种菜、修理房舍、挖寻财物和收集农具等善后工作，并已开始领导灾民进行副业生产和争取一部还可能挽救的田禾的秋收。因此，目前灾情已告稳定。辽西省人民政府并已订出了灾民生产计划，根据这个计划，今冬明春每一灾民最低可生产三百斤粮食。
    会议于讨论救灾的方针、政策和组织领导工作之后，对于发放贷款，以及筹集和发放粮食、寒衣、木料等救济物资，都作了缜密的研究和决定。会议并强调提出：灾区应进一步调查灾情，了解灾民的生活需要与生产需要，以便切实的救济。干部应深入了解灾民的思想情况和困难，对灾民进行生产自救的宣传教育，并帮助灾民想办法；应防止和反对工作不深入的官僚主义的偏向。
