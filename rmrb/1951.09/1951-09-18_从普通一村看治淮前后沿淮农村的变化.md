In the first year of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River, new scenes have already appeared in the vast rural areas of the Huai River Basin. Yutan Village in Fengyang County, northern Anhui Province, is just an ordinary village among these millions of villages.

"Fengyang is originally a good place," but because the reactionary rulers over the years only cared about exploiting the people and were unwilling or unable to repair the Huai River, and even destroyed the Huai River, Fengyang, like most places along the Huai River, "suffered famine in nine out of ten years." The disasters left by the reactionary rulers continued to harm the people on both sides of the Huai River for two years after liberation.

Fengyang Yutan Village is a village along the Huai River. The entire village has 204 households, 1,097 people, 2,885 mu of farmland, 74 livestock, and 1,062 houses. During the flood in July last year, the entire village had 2,400 mu of autumn crops submerged, 874 houses collapsed, and 40 shi of stored grain and most of the clothing and farm tools were washed away. At that time, the water was so fierce that some people did not have time to escape and climbed to the tops of trees and houses. In the midst of the wind and waves and in a very critical situation, the county chief and district chief of the People's Government personally led rescue boats and rescued them to the highlands and settled them properly.

After the water receded last year, the masses returned to the village and had no way to live. They had no seeds to plant. The People's Government promptly sent people to distribute seeds for replanting late autumn crops: 600 jin of rapeseed, 50 jin of cabbage seed, 800 jin of buckwheat seed, 100 jin of radish seed, and 10,044 jin of wheat seed; it also distributed relief grain: 1,530 jin of rice, 1,230 jin of salt, 3,400 jin of sorghum, and 180 jin of bean cake; in addition, 800 pieces of clothing and 2,700 jin of grass were distributed. There were also sideline production grains: 2,955 jin of mung beans for flour mills, 742 jin of sorghum, 1,000 jin of rice for transportation funds, and 7,700 reeds. In this way, the masses in the village launched a production and disaster relief movement, replanting late autumn crops and wheat; in sideline production, they also earned 2,223 jin of rice.

They have suffered from the Huai River for years. Therefore, as soon as the People's Government called for the harnessing of the Huai River, 194 able-bodied men and women from the entire village formed a Huai River Harnessing Team and actively participated in the Huai River Harnessing effort. In the winter and spring repairs last year and this year, they won the title of Model Team three times in a row, and 19 people were rated as individual models. In the Huai River Harnessing work, they received a total of 85,240 jin of rice in wages. In this way, they smoothly survived the famine and had no difficulty until the summer harvest.

This year, the village's 2,019 mu of wheat fields harvested a total of 430,390 jin. After the wheat harvest, the entire village built 32 new houses and 310 small huts, bought 24 cattle and 26 donkeys, and each household also added farm tools and clothing. Their lives will get better and better. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they will use their own strength to conquer all the disasters left by the reactionary rulers in history!

    从普通一村看治淮前后沿淮农村的变化
    根治淮河的第一年，淮河流域广大农村已经出现了新光景。皖北凤阳县俞滩村，就是这千百万农村中的普通的一个村子。
    “凤阳本是好地方”，可是由于历年反动统治者只顾剥削人民，却不肯也不会修淮河，甚至破坏淮河，凤阳就和淮河沿岸大部分地方一样，“十年倒有九年荒”。反动统治者留下的灾难，直到解放后的两年间仍然害着淮河两岸的人民。
    凤阳俞滩村是沿淮河的一个村子，全村二百零四户，一千零九十七人，田地二千八百八十五亩，牲畜七十四条，房子一千零六十二间。去年七月洪水暴涨时，全村被淹没了二千四百亩秋庄稼，被冲倒八百七十四间房屋，损失存粮四十石，衣物农具大部被冲走。当时水势凶猛，群众有的来不及逃走，爬到树梢房顶。正在风浪交加、万分危急的情况下，人民政府的县长和区长都亲自带领抢救船来了，把他们抢救到岗上，妥善地安置下来。
    去年水落后，群众回到村里，生活没有办法，要种地没有种籽。人民政府及时派人发下了补种晚秋的种籽：油菜籽六百斤，白菜籽五十斤，荞麦籽八百斤，萝卜籽一百斤，麦种一万零四十四斤；还发下了救济粮：米一千五百三十斤，食盐一千二百三十斤，高粱三千四百斤，豆饼一百八十斤；此外还发放了衣服八百件，草二千七百斤。另外还有副业生产粮：粉坊绿豆二千九百五十五斤，高粱七百四十二斤，贩运资金米一千斤，芦苇七千七百个。这样，该村群众就开展了生产救灾运动，补种了晚秋和麦子；在副业生产中，还赚到米二千二百二十三斤。
    他们历年受着淮河的害，所以，人民政府一号召修淮河，全村男女一百九十四个整劳力就组成一个治淮分队，积极参加治淮。在去年冬修和今年春修中，他们连续三次获得了模范分队的称号，还有十九个人被评为个人模范。在治淮工作中，他们共得工资米八万五千二百四十斤。这样就顺利地度过了灾荒，直到夏季丰收没有一点困难。
    今年全村二千零十九亩麦田，共收获四十三万零三千九百斤。麦收后，全村共盖新房三十二间、小庵子三百十个，买牛二十四条、驴二十六条，每家还添置了农具、衣服。他们的日子将要越来越好。在共产党和人民政府的领导下，他们将用自己的力量征服历史上反动统治者遗留下来的一切灾患！
