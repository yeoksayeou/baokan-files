    Subjectivism Causes Trouble
    Suzhou Nanmen Bridge Reworked Midway

    To the Editor:
    The Nanmen Bridge project in Suzhou City, due to the bureaucratic style of the leading cadres and the empiricism of the engineering designers, commenced blindly without proper and thorough design. This resulted in a mid-project change of plans, delaying the project by more than three months and wasting over 100 million yuan in construction funds.

    Before the project started, the leading cadres and engineering designers did not conduct serious investigation and research. Relying solely on their narrow past experience in bridge construction, they assumed that the soil quality on both banks of the Nanmen Bridge to be built would be similar to that of the bridge on the city's outer moats. They rashly decided on the project plan and started construction in February this year. The original plan was to build the bridge foundation with wooden piles and stones, and the bridge piers and deck in the river with reinforced concrete. The total length of the bridge was set at 26 meters, and the bridge deck 3.7 meters above the water level. As a result, when the bridge foundation on the south side was being constructed, the soil at the bottom of the river was found to be loose, and the water level outside the dam rose, threatening to breach the earthen dam. Dozens of small wooden piles were added, but this did not help. It was then necessary to redrive over one hundred large wooden piles. In this dam construction project alone, the delay was more than a month, and the loss was more than 30 million yuan. After the pile driving project on the south bridge foundation began, it was discovered that the south bank, up to four meters below the water level, was still cinders, and the soil was six or seven times looser than the north bank. Only after asking the local masses was it learned that the construction site of the south bridge foundation was the mouth of an inner river flowing into the canal sixty years ago. The leading comrades then realized that hasty construction had caused trouble and had to change the plan mid-project. The original plan of using wooden piles and stones for the south bank bridge foundation was now changed to reinforced concrete; the bridge length was increased to 28 meters; and the bridge deck was raised to four meters above the water surface. Because of the change in plans and the addition of materials, the completion date of the entire project was delayed by more than three months compared to the original plan; the original total project cost of 580 million yuan now requires more than 700 million yuan to complete.

### 主观主义坏了事  苏州南门大桥中途返工

    主观主义坏了事
    苏州南门大桥中途返工编辑同志：
    苏州市建设的南门大桥工程，由于领导干部存在着官僚主义，工程设计人员存在着经验主义，没有正确周密的设计，就盲目动工，致中途改变工程计划，使工程延期三个多月，浪费建设资金一亿多元。
    工程施工前，领导干部和工程设计人员，没有进行认真的调查研究，只凭过去造桥的狭隘经验，以为拟造中的南门大桥两岸土质，大概与原来城外的几条城河大桥两岸的土质相仿，就贸然决定工程计划，于今年二月开始施工。原定计划是桥基用木桩石头建造，河中桥桩桥面用钢骨水泥建造；桥身全长二十六公尺，桥面距水位三点七公尺。结果大桥南面的桥基施工时，因河底土质松软，坝外水位又已高涨，土坝就有破裂之势，加打小木桩数十根后，也无济于事，于是被迫重打大木桩一百多根。这样，单在筑坝一项工程中，就延长了一个多月，损失三千多万元。南面桥基打桩工程开始后，发现南岸距水位四公尺以下仍是煤屑质，土质松软程度，较北岸还差六七成。经向当地群众询问，才发现南面桥基建设地点，在六十年前是一条内河流入运河的出口处。领导同志至此才感到草率施工坏了事，不得不中途改变计划。原来南岸桥基用木桩石头，现在改用钢骨水泥；桥长增至二十八公尺；桥面加高距离水面至四公尺。因为改变计划，增添了材料，全部工程完成日期较原定计划推迟三个多月；原定全部工程费用五亿八千余万元，现在需要七亿多万元才能完成。
