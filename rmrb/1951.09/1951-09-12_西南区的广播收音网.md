According to the Chongqing Xinhua Daily of August 30th, small and medium-sized cities in the Southwest provinces and regions have universally established broadcast radio networks. These networks have played a certain role in carrying out patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, conveying government policies and decrees, and promoting production. They have enhanced the political awareness of the broad masses and enriched the cultural life of the people.

According to incomplete statistics from Guizhou, West Sichuan, South Sichuan, North Sichuan, and East Sichuan provinces and regions (excluding Chengdu and Guiyang), a total of 259 broadcast radio stations have been established in various special districts and counties. Many areas with power generation equipment have also established wired broadcasting stations. In the work of establishing broadcast radio stations, the Southwest People's Broadcasting Station and the West Sichuan, South Sichuan, and Guizhou People's Broadcasting Stations have successively held training classes for announcers, training 360 announcers for radio stations in various places.

Every day, the announcers at radio stations in various places can transcribe important news and government decrees broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station and quickly disseminate them to the masses through various means such as mimeographed newspapers, blackboard newspapers, large-character posters, and rooftop broadcasts. They also organize the masses to listen to important programs on the radio. For example, among the 40 radio stations in the North Sichuan area, 12 stations have mimeographed newspapers, and 23 stations have blackboard newspapers; among the 48 radio stations in the West Sichuan area, 22 stations publish regular or irregular mimeographed newspapers. Many propaganda organizations and agencies, groups, factories, and schools in various places have promptly obtained propaganda and learning materials from the radio stations. It is estimated that more than 1.2 million people in the Southwest are affected by radio propaganda through radio stations every day.

Because radio stations can promptly disseminate news and organize the masses to listen to important programs, the propaganda effect is significant. Most of the announcers from radio stations in various places reported to the Southwest People's Broadcasting Station that the news they transcribed, especially the news about resisting America and aiding Korea, was greatly welcomed by local cadres and the masses after being disseminated in various ways. Many people, after obtaining materials from blackboard newspapers, mimeographed newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, etc., told their families, relatives, and neighbors, becoming "volunteer propagandists." In some places, after hearing the news of the nationwide donation movement, a donation craze was immediately launched locally.

The broadcast radio network has also played a certain role in promoting work and helping cadres learn. The Xichong County Radio Station in North Sichuan disseminated the notice from the Southwest Region Grain Administration regarding this summer's grain requisition work, which helped the local grain requisition work. Many radio stations organize local cadres and students to listen to "learning lectures"; cadres in Xinjin County, West Sichuan, carry oil lamps and notebooks to the radio station every night to listen to "The History of Social Development."

At present, although the work of the broadcast radio network in various parts of the Southwest Region has made great achievements, there are still many problems. The most important is that the propaganda departments of the Chinese Communist Party and the government's cultural and educational departments in some places do not provide enough leadership to this work. Many radio stations lack funding and cadres, and some places even casually transfer announcers to other jobs. The cultivation, leadership, and education of announcers must be strengthened. More importantly, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda network over the radio network, as well as the mutual cooperation between the radio network and other propaganda organizations, have not yet been resolved.

    西南区的广播收音网
    据八月三十日重庆新华日报载，西南各省、区的中小城市，普遍建立了广播收音网，在进行抗美援朝爱国主义宣传、传达政府政策法令、推动生产等各方面都起了一定的作用，提高了广大人民的政治认识，丰富了人民群众的文化生活。
    据贵州、川西、川南、川北、川东等五个省、区的不完全统计，各专区和县（成都、贵阳两市未列入）共建立了广播收音站二百五十九个。不少有发电设备的地区，并已建立有线广播站。在建立广播收音站的工作中，西南人民广播电台和川西、川南、贵州人民广播电台，都先后举办了收音员训练班，为各地收音站训练了收音员三百六十名。
    各地收音站的收音员，每天都能抄收人民广播电台播发的重要新闻和政府法令，通过油印报、黑板报、大字报、屋顶广播等各种方式，迅速地传播到群众中去；并组织群众收听广播中的重要节目。如川北区的四十个收音站中，有十二个站办了油印报，二十三个站办了黑板报；川西区的四十八个收音站，有二十二个站出版了定期的或不定期的油印报。各地许多宣传组织和机关、团体、工厂、学校，都从收音站及时地取得了宣传和学习的资料。估计西南各地通过收音站受到广播宣传影响的群众，每天达一百二十万人以上。
    因为收音站能及时传播消息并组织群众收听重要节目，宣传效力很大。大多数地方的收音员给西南人民广播电台的报告中都说，他们所抄收的新闻，特别是有关抗美援朝的消息，通过各种方式传播出去之后，受到了当地机关干部和人民群众的很大欢迎。许多人从黑板报、油印报、屋顶广播等等获得材料之后，就转告家人、亲友和邻舍们，成了“义务宣传员”。有的地方收听到全国人民展开捐献运动的消息后，立即在当地掀起了捐献热潮。
    广播收音网在推动工作和帮助干部学习方面也起了一定的作用。川北西充县收音站传播了西南区粮食管理局关于今年夏季征粮工作中的通知后，帮助了该地的征粮工作。很多收音站都组织当地干部和学生收听“学习讲座”；川西新津县干部每晚提着油灯带着笔记本到收音站去收听“社会发展史”。
    目前西南区各地的广播收音网工作虽然有了很大成绩，但存在的问题还很多。最主要的是有些地方的中国共产党的宣传部门与政府文教部门对这一工作的领导还不够。许多收音站缺乏经费和干部，有的地方甚至随便把收音员调去作其他工作。对收音员的培养、领导与教育还须加强。更重要的是中国共产党的宣传网对于收音网的领导，以及收音网与其他宣传组织的互相配合问题，还没有解决。
