Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The U.S. draft of the peace treaty with Japan and the conspiracy to rearm Japan have met with widespread dissatisfaction and opposition in Asian countries and Australia, which suffered from the aggression of Japanese imperialism during the war.

Shortly after the second publication of the U.S. draft of the peace treaty with Japan on July 12, Huang Mingjian, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a statement on July 20, protesting the conspiracy of the U.S. and British governments to hold a peace conference to conclude a separate treaty. The statement particularly emphasized that only the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the legitimate representative of the Vietnamese people when signing the peace treaty with Japan. Vietnamese people's organizations and public opinion unanimously condemned the U.S. draft of the peace treaty with Japan and the U.S. "invitation" to the Bao Dai puppet to participate in the San Francisco conference. The Vietnamese people expressed unparalleled anger at the U.S. policy of separate peace with Japan, and they could not forget the atrocities of the Japanese fascists who starved two million Vietnamese people to death during their occupation of Vietnam.

In India, the Indian government formally sent a note to the United States on August 23, stating that the Indian government opposed the U.S. draft treaty and refused to participate in the San Francisco conference. Prior to this, vast mass organizations in India, including the All-India Trade Union Congress, the All-India Farmers' Union, and the All-India Students' Federation, all declared that they would never accept the U.S. draft and were determined to strive for a genuine peace treaty with Japan. Prominent figures in India, such as Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, Basu, Communist member of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, Mrs. Aruna Asaf Ali, leader of the Left Socialist Party, and novelist Dr. Mulk Raj Anand, all issued statements condemning the U.S. separate peace with Japan and the aggressive conspiracy to rearm Japan. Newspapers in various places increasingly criticized the U.S. draft treaty and its overbearing attitude. The "Hindustan Standard" recently said: "The U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan extends the Monroe Doctrine far into the Eastern Hemisphere and virtually cancels Japan's status as an independent country."

The U.S. draft was similarly rejected in Burma. The Burmese government also decided to refuse to attend the San Francisco conference. Following the meeting against the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan hosted by the Burmese Supporters of World Peace Conference on August 12, on August 25, representatives of twenty political parties and organizations, including the Burmese Supporters of World Peace Conference, the Burmese Workers and Peasants Party, and the People's Peace Front, and about 1,000 people from all walks of life, including workers, businessmen, students, and women, held a mass rally in Yangon against the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan. Yu Baying, a member of the Central Committee of the Workers and Peasants Party, said at the meeting that the Burmese people only need a peace treaty with Japan that is beneficial to the peace of Burma and Asia, and the Burmese people are determined to continue to struggle for this.

In Indonesia, the Indonesian Communist Party first issued a statement on July 27, severely criticizing the U.S. draft of the peace treaty with Japan. The influential Islamic newspaper "Abadi" also pointed out in its editorial on August 20 that the U.S. draft "is entirely for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the United States in the Far East." At the same time, the call for opposition to the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan is also very common in the Indonesian Parliament. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Jakarta, "parliamentary sources" said on August 27 that only 20 percent of the members of the Indonesian Parliament supported signing the U.S. peace treaty with Japan.

The U.S. draft is equally unpopular in the Philippines. The Filipino people will never forget the massacre by the Japanese invaders under the command of Yamashita Tomoyuki. Amidst the Filipino people's passionate opposition to the U.S. draft of the peace treaty with Japan, the "League of Free Youth" held a grand demonstration of 5,000 people in Manila on July 17, and the masses burned the portrait of the war monger Dulles, expressing their protest against the draft treaty he drafted.

The mass movement against the U.S.-made draft of the peace treaty with Japan and the U.S. rearmament of Japan is also growing in Australia. Under the initiative of the Committee Against Rearming Japan, a mass protest meeting against the rearmament of Japan was held in Sydney on July 24. Following this, a national patriotic protest week against arming Japan was held from August 12 to 18. During this week, many union members stopped work and remained silent for a few minutes to protest the U.S. draft of the peace treaty with Japan. On the last day of the protest week, a mass meeting of 2,000 people was held in Melbourne. The meeting decided to send a representative to Prime Minister Menzies to request Australia to refuse to sign the U.S. draft of the peace treaty with Japan. Now, the Committee Against Rearming Japan is launching a voting campaign "Do you agree with rearming Japan?" Tens of thousands of ballot papers are being distributed in factories and workshops in New South Wales. Prior to this, more than 15,000 people had signed to express their opposition to rearming Japan.

The U.S. draft of the peace treaty with Japan is so unpopular in the Far East and even the world that even the British "Times" of August 29 said in frustration: "The current situation is that the eve of the San Francisco conference has become an unhappy eve." The newspaper sadly admitted: "Count the ardent supporters of U.S. policy, and there is only Japan."

### 不能容许美国重新武装日本  亚澳各国人民反对美制对日和约

    不能容许美国重新武装日本
    亚澳各国人民反对美制对日和约
    【新华社二日讯】美国对日和约草案和重新武装日本的阴谋，已在战时曾经遭受日本帝国主义侵略之害的亚洲各国以及澳大利亚，遭到普遍的不满和反对。
    在美国对日和约草案于七月十二日第二次公布之后不久，越南民主共和国外交部长黄明鉴即于七月二十日发表声明，抗议美英两国政府为缔结单独和约而准备举行和会的阴谋。声明特别强调指出：在签订对日和约时，唯有越南民主共和国政府才是越南人民的合法代表。越南的人民团体和舆论一致斥责美国对日和约草案和美国“邀请”保大傀儡参加旧金山会议。越南人民对美国单独对日媾和的政策，表示无比的愤怒，他们忘不了日本法西斯分子占领越南期间曾使两百万越南人民饿毙的暴行。
    在印度，印度政府已于八月二十三日正式照会美国，声明印度政府反对美国的和约草案，并拒绝参加旧金山会议。在此以前，印度的广大群众组织，包括全印总工会、全印农民联盟、全印学生联合会，都宣告它们决不接受美国草案，决心争取真正的对日和约。印度的著名人士，如：全印和平理事会主席赛福丁博士、西孟加拉省立法议会共产党议员巴苏、左翼社会党人的领袖阿鲁娜·阿萨夫·阿里夫人、小说家莫尔克·拉吉·安纳达博士等，纷纷发表谈话，谴责美国单独对日媾和、重新武装日本的侵略阴谋。各地报纸愈来愈多地批评美国的和约草案及其横蛮的态度。“印度斯坦旗报”最近说：“美制对日和约是将门罗主义远远地伸延到东半球来，并且实际上取消了日本的独立国的资格。”
    美国的草案在缅甸也同样地遭受拒斥。缅甸政府也决定拒绝出席旧金山会议。继八月十二日缅甸拥护世界和平大会所主持的反对美制对日和约会议之后，八月二十五日，缅甸拥护世界和平大会、缅甸工农党、人民和平阵线等二十个政党、团体的代表和工人、商人、学生、妇女各界人士约一千余人，又在仰光举行了反对美制对日和约群众大会。工农党中央委员宇巴迎在会上说：缅甸人民只需要一个对缅甸与亚洲和平有益的对日和约，缅甸人民坚决为此继续斗争。
    在印尼，印尼共产党首先在七月二十七日发表声明，严厉地抨击美国对日和约草案。有影响的回教日报“阿巴第”报在八月二十日的社论中也指出：美国的草案“完全是为了保障美国在远东的利益”。同时，反对美制对日和约的呼声，在印尼议会中也很普遍。据美联社雅加达讯，“议会方面人士”八月二十七日说：印尼议会议员中只有百分之二十是赞成参加美国对日和约签字的。
    美国的草案在菲律宾同样不得人心。菲律宾人民永远忘不了在山下奉文指挥下日寇的大屠杀。在菲律宾人民反对美国对日和约草案的激昂情绪下，“自由青年联盟”曾于七月十七日在马尼拉举行了五千人的盛大示威游行，群众并焚毁了战争贩子杜勒斯的肖像，表示他们对他所起草的和约草案的抗议。
    反对美制对日和约草案和美国重新武装日本的群众运动，也在澳大利亚日益增长。在反对重新武装日本委员会的发起之下，七月二十四日在悉尼举行了反对重新武装日本的群众抗议大会。接着，从八月十二日至十八日又举行了全国反对武装日本爱国抗议周。在这一周内，许多工会会员都曾停工静默数分钟，抗议美国对日和约草案。抗议周结束那一天，墨尔本举行了有两千人参加的群众大会。大会决议派遣代表向孟席斯总理要求澳大利亚拒绝在美国对日和约草案上签字。现在，反对重新武装日本委员会正在发起“你是否赞成重新武装日本”的投票运动。成千成万的投票纸正在新南威尔士洲的工厂和工场开始散发。在此以前，已有一万五千人以上签名表示反对重新武装日本。
    美国对日和约草案在远东以至全世界是如此地不得人心，甚至八月二十九日的英国“泰晤士报”都在沮丧地说：“当前的情况就是：旧金山会议的前夕成了不欢的前夕。”该报悲哀地承认：“数一数美国政策的热烈拥护者吧，那就只有日本了。”
