    Eliminating Morbid and Ugly Images on the Opera Stage
    Ma Shaobo
    The stage images of Chinese opera have a healthy, beautiful, and correct side; they also have a morbid, ugly, and distorted side. Although the health or morbidity, beauty or ugliness, correctness or distortion of opera primarily lie in its ideological content, they must be expressed through corresponding images. What are the morbid, ugly, and distorted images on the old opera stage?
            First, Bound Feet
    The stage presentation of bound feet mainly involves "qiao gong" (literally "stilts work", referring to the special shoes and gait of women with bound feet). This is a concentrated expression of the historical oppression and humiliation of Chinese women, resulting in physical disability. The barbaric destruction of women by feudal rulers is a stain on the history of our Chinese nation and should not be artistically represented at all, let alone appreciated as art. Some people say, "Qiao gong cannot be changed, small feet are very beautiful." This undoubtedly reflects the thinking of the feudal ruling class. This kind of thinking is absolutely unacceptable. After abolishing "qiao", some people worry that the dance movements of female roles will become stiff as a result. This concern is also superfluous. Many actors have not practiced "qiao gong", but their movements are not ugly or stiff; on the contrary, they are very healthy and natural. Some people say: "I used to practice 'qiao gong' and suffered a lot, and the audience welcomed us very much; now that I don't wear 'qiao', will the audience not welcome us?" This kind of thinking is also wrong. Mr. Wang Yaoqing and Mr. Mei Lanfang voluntarily abolished "qiao gong" very early on, and the audience has always welcomed them!
    It is undoubtedly correct that small feet should not be represented, and "qiao gong" should be abolished. Therefore, the small-foot shoe vamps used in plays such as "Picking up the Jade Bracelet" to demonstrate needlework should naturally be changed. Wouldn't it be perfectly acceptable to change this to making clothes? Furthermore, phrases in drum lyrics that praise "golden lotuses" and "lotus steps" should also be deleted or revised.
        Second, Lewdness and Obscenity
    This means that some actors perform expressions of love between men and women in a very vulgar manner. "Feet picking and eyes moving," wearing fake nipples, wearing a dudou (a traditional Chinese undergarment), shaking bed curtains, and pointing two index fingers up and down; such as the obscene and vulgar language in "Iron Bow Marriage" during the "matching up" and "jealousy" scenes; some actors prominently and exaggeratedly portray the psychology of spring fever on stage, as in plays such as "Hong Niang," "Great Splitting Coffin," "Battle of Wancheng," and "Widow Ma Opens a Shop." This kind of obscene performance, although mainly determined by the script, the actor's performance method and attitude often play a decisive role. Some actors also perform "Yutangchun" and "Imperial Stele Pavilion" with exaggerated expressions and unseemly lewdness, catering to the low tastes of some backward audiences. The actors themselves are delighted when they hear these backward audiences cheering and applauding, and they are not ashamed! This kind of performance is harmful and must be reformed.
            Third, Superstition and Terror
        "Exploring Yin Mountain" and "Touring the Six Palaces" are the most typical examples. These plays mainly promote "cyclic retribution", terrifying and fooling the people through the images of evil spirits and ghosts in the underworld. Some people say: "Sun Wukong causing havoc in the Heavenly Palace can be performed, why can't causing havoc in the Underworld be performed?" We believe that the Underworld will only produce the effect of terror and superstition and should not be put on stage. Some viewers in the past had superstitious ideas, and seeing these concrete images of Black and White Impermanence, Ox-Head and Horse-Face, etc., will only deepen their impressions, even mistakenly believing in their real existence; young people and children who were previously unaware of the "Underworld" will inevitably have a shadow of superstition cast on their minds, which is absolutely unacceptable!
    Some people say: "To break superstition, we must specifically perform superstitious images and openly criticize them." This is obviously wrong. Because the Underworld is only a feudal and backward ideology, not an objective existence, how can putting these superstitious images on stage have the effect of breaking superstition! We have no reason to put these superstitious and terrifying images on the people's stage again. It is reasonable to resolutely eliminate it. For example, in the play "Zhong Kui," the hanged ghost, the shoe ghost, the big-head ghost, and the small-head ghost fill the stage with a ghastly atmosphere and ghostly shadows. This must be resolutely abolished.
        Fourth, Cruel Torture and Murder
    There are also many performances of cruel punishments and barbaric killings in operas, such as the rolling on nail boards in "Nine Watch Nights," the opening of the guillotine in "The Case of Chen Shimei," the skinning in "Fengbo Pavilion," the breaking of the belly and flowing of intestines in "Jiepai Pass," the cutting open of the chest and gouging out of the heart and eye-scorching in "King Zhou and Daji," Li Gang beating the court in "Qingyang Map," tearing off the legs of the treacherous Ma Lan; Yao Gang in "Huang Yidao" cutting off a woman's leg and using it as a combat weapon, even putting the small foot of the severed limb to his nose to smell! Dian Wei in "Battle of Wancheng" using two corpses to replace weapons, Yan Peizhang in "Five Martyrs" catching the enemy and gouging out his eyes and eating them. There are also performances in some black shop dramas of slaughtering people like cattle and sheep, wrapping human meat into dumplings. Performances such as these must be resolutely abolished.
        Fifth, Spanking
    Spanking realistically on stage is also very ugly. In "Rainbow Pass," making jokes while spanking is the most typical bad example; the image of crawling on a bench to be beaten in "Double Afraid Wife" seriously hurts national self-esteem! Of course, spanking is a type of ancient Chinese punishment, and it can be said to be the most common; however, this ugly image has been used by British and American imperialists as a laughing stock to distort and ridicule the Chinese people. We believe that spanking should generally not be done on stage and can be moved to backstage, such as the beating of Xiao En in "Fishing and Killing the Family" and the beating of Wang Ping in "Cutting Ma Su." These are all handled very well. In fact, moving the beating backstage not only does not harm the plot but also strengthens the depth of the performance. Because it is necessary to explain the reality of having been punished, the actor must strengthen the depth of the performance through singing, words, and expressions. The performance of Xiao En in the section "Angry with that LÃ¼ Ziqiu" is like this.
            Sixth, Kowtowing
    Kowtowing is a type of ancient Chinese etiquette, but this etiquette is mostly used by subordinates to superiors, especially by the oppressed to the oppressors. On stage, the image of the laboring people kowtowing like pounding garlic is often portrayed. The oppressors will never show "Please accept my bow" to the oppressed, unless they are in dire straits and beg the oppressed to die in their place (such as "A Pinch of Snow").
    On the opera stage, the laboring people kowtowing to the reactionary feudal rulers happens far too often! For example, in "June Snow," Dou E suffered such a deep and unjust grievance that she still had to kneel and bow to the executioner when she was executed, which is truly embarrassing.
        Seventh, Braids
    Men shaving their heads and wearing braids was a shameful symbol left over from the Manchu era for national oppression and assimilation of the Han people. Before the Manchu army entered the Pass, they began to force the Han people to submit and surrender, using shaving the head as a sign of surrender. The order was: "People in all places outside the city should quickly shave their heads and surrender. Those who are willing to shave their heads and surrender should come to pay their respects to the Emperor!..." (See Secret Records of Manchu Archives). After entering the Pass, during the Shunzhi period, the head-shaving order became even stricter, such as: "...Now inside and outside is one family, the ruler is like a father, and the people are like sons. Father and son are one body, how can they be different? If they are not unified, they will ultimately be of two minds, would they not almost be people of a foreign country?... From now on, after the announcement, inside and outside the capital, the time limit is ten days. In the provinces directly under the jurisdiction, the time limit is also ten days after the official documents arrive. All must be ordered to shave their heads! Those who comply are the people of our country, and those who hesitate are the rebels who disobey the orders and will be severely punished. Those who avoid and cherish their hair and argue with clever words will never be lightly forgiven! The local civil and military officials must strictly inspect and verify, and those who repeatedly submit memorials on this matter, wanting to retain the Ming system in the areas that have been determined and not follow the system of our dynasty, will be killed without pardon." (See Complete Account of the Manchus Deceiving the Chinese). It can be seen how severely the Han people suffered under the forced surrender order of "Keep the hair, lose the head; keep the head, lose the hair." Therefore, this is by no means a matter of custom, but a shameful symbol of national oppression.
        Eighth, Unscientific Martial Arts
    Martial arts are inherently dangerous, but as a result of long-term hard study and practice, the danger will be avoided considerably because of accuracy. The tradition of diligence, bravery, and hard work of the Chinese people is also reflected in the martial arts of opera. They will never shrink back due to the danger. But this refers to the general situation of practicing martial arts; as for individual martial arts that are very dangerous, very barbaric and cruel, harmful to the health of actors, and very ugly in image, such as ankle-breaking and somersaulting in the clouds, they should be resolutely eliminated. Another type is martial arts performance that is divorced from the plot, such as the performance of street performance in "Four Heroes Village." Compared with the performance of "San Cha Kou" where martial arts are closely integrated with the plot, the failure and success are most obvious. Furthermore, the way of fighting is extremely unrealistic. I think it can be researched and improved to integrate it well with the plot, that is to say, to make it truly a dramatic art. If it is impossible to combine with the plot, it is best to put it in the acrobatic troupe in order to preserve this skill. Because fighting on stage, despite the need for artistic exaggeration, must always conform to reality. It is absolutely impossible for the two sides to exchange weapons in turn like a game. Some people say: This is a performance of fighting, then this performance is not like the situation described in old novels, and what is the meaning of performing "fighting"! In addition, such as
    "Comical Fighting," "Somersaulting Over the City," etc., are not correct performance methods and often degenerate into vulgarity. Even general performances are often like this. When expressing thinking or anxiety, they always tap the forehead lightly with their fingers. This is reasonable, but in this case, the actors always have subordinate movements, such as rubbing the buttocks while tapping the forehead. What does this mean! This type of ugly performance format is certainly unrelated to martial arts, but it should also be studied and revised.
            Ninth, Blowing the Nose
    Blowing one's nose on stage is an expression of extremely dirty and backward habits. The most typical example is in "Double Shake Association", where someone blows his nose, and
    another person said: "Don't throw away the snot! This thing is better than a magical elixir, it can nourish yin, strengthen the kidneys, and replenish vitality!" This kind of boring banter simply causes people's physiological nausea. It is also a bad habit for some actors to spit on the stage at will. In addition, performing urination, defecation, drinking urine, and eating feces on the opera stage is really extremely dirty! I think this kind of performance should be eliminated. The act of blowing one's nose when groping in the dark in dramas such as "Daming Mansion," "Erlong Mountain"
    "Clever Chain" and "Cross Slope" should also be changed.
        Tenth, Ugly Facial Makeup
    The facial makeup of Chinese opera should not be completely obliterated. Its origin, it is said, dates back to the early days of Tang and Song dynasty drama. The shows were performed in public squares. In order to help the audience recognize the faces of the characters and distinguish their personalities, it gradually developed. This exaggerated technique is not only found in facial makeup, but also in the music, singing, recitative, dance, and costumes of opera. This is an important indication that Chinese opera came from the people, from the fields to the court. Facial makeup is basically acceptable. However, some facial makeups are really too ferocious and ugly, such as "broken face," "crooked face," "ghost face," the intricately complex "three-piece tile flower," insulting the laboring people's
    "tofu block" etc. In addition, there are those with feudal superstitious components, such as the crescent moon on Bao Zheng's facial makeup (symbolizing judgment of the underworld at night), the dragon shape under Zhao Kuangyin's facial makeup left eyebrow (symbolizing imperial status), the Tai Chi diagram on Jiang Wei's facial makeup (indicating that Jiang Wei is good at using yin and yang eight trigrams), and the tiger character on Yang Qilang's facial makeup (symbolizing the descent of the Black Tiger) etc. All of these should be appropriately deleted, simplified, or modified according to specific circumstances.
        Eleventh, Unreasonable Costumes
    The costumes of old operas generally lack a precise costume design system due to the lack of directing work, so they are often dressed very unreasonably. The play tells the story of Qin, Han, Tang, Song, and Ming, but there are often characters wearing Manchu costumes appearing on stage. It is difficult to distinguish the changes in Chinese historical costumes very specifically and accurately on stage, but it is always possible to achieve a general distinction at present. It is said that dressing yamen runners, prison guards, escorts, procuresses, lo mao (a derogatory term for foreign devils), and even blind people and doctors in Qing costumes is to show contempt for these people; even so, this should be fundamentally changed now. Because such a performance is completely meaningless and is only an unnecessary and unwarranted insult; moreover, the contempt for these people at that time was clearly the view of the feudal ruling class. To take a step back, even if these people are not good, are they not worse than reactionary rulers who eat people! Moreover, some of them, such as blind people, are an unfortunate physiological disability, and if this contemptuous meaning is still retained in the appearance, it would be a great insult and injury.
        Twelfth, Stagehands
    This is a backward phenomenon that has existed in the style of Chinese opera stage for many years. The stage performances are historical stories and ancient characters, but letting modern characters, or green-clothed small hats, or bald-headed short jackets, or cadre uniforms, appear on the stage makes the ancient and modern times chaotic on one stage, which not only destroys the plot but also seriously damages the integrity of the art form. Therefore, I believe that in order to maintain the cleanliness and perfection of the stage image and the formality and seriousness of the stage style, stagehands must be hidden. Many newly compiled dramas have already done this completely. It is not very difficult to avoid stagehands appearing on the stage in old dramas either. Stagehands have only two main tasks on stage: one is to arrange tables and chairs; the other is to help actors change costumes and remove headdresses on the spot. It is not very difficult to change these tasks. It is also really unreasonable for the characters in the play to have to fly over a cushion when kneeling and bowing. According to my guess, probably when performing in the countryside, the stage was made of earth or wooden boards, and kneeling down would easily get the clothes dirty, so it was always necessary to lay a cushion when kneeling, bowing, or falling. This is completely reasonable; today, when performing in the theater, the stage is covered with carpets, and it is still necessary to fly the cushion, which is completely unnecessary.
    I say this not because I don't want stagehands and stagehand work, but only to ask that this work be placed behind the scenes. The work of stagehands is part of the stage work, it is the work of the backstage, and it should not be seen by the audience. As long as you use your brain more, the difficulties can be completely overcome.
    We have been brewing the problem of hiding stagehands in the opera stage for many years, and we have also made some attempts. It should be said that we have had successful experiences. In the past, some people said that "the play cannot be performed" or "the audience will not accept it" if the stagehands do not appear, but now facts have given strong persuasion. After the play starts, no one except the characters in the play should show up and run around on the stage. The band also finds a way to hide, so that the stage will be clean, reasonable, and perfect.
            Thirteenth, Walking Corpses
    In old opera performances, it is common to see people come back to life after they die. After a character dies, the actor gets up and leaves the stage in the identity of the actor. After Jiao Bing and Murong Lie in "Yangping Pass" are stabbed to death by Zhao Yun, they actually perform "returning to the yang world" and leave the stage. It is said that there is such a joke in a certain city: After a strong man killed a corrupt official, he ordered him: "Corpse, retreat!" So the corpse obediently stood up, made a face to the audience, and retreated according to orders. This is the so-called walking corpse. The unreasonableness of this performance is self-evident. Don't think that the audience is used to it and that you can just stick to your old ways and not make reforms.
            Fourteenth, Drinking on Stage
    Drinking on stage naturally has its reasons: to protect the voice. However, there will not be too much singing work in each play. Is it possible to drink water after leaving the stage? I think it is completely possible. In "Three Halls Trial," the singing work of the female role is very heavy. We have had many comrades and actors do experiments. It is completely possible not to drink water. This is just a matter of habit. Undoubtedly, drinking on stage also destroys the plot. In short, drinking and stagehands have the same bad effects of interrupting the plot and making the stage chaotic, which should be resolutely avoided.
        Fifteenth, Stage Manager
    The stage manager was originally a kind of supervision of the performance of the apprentice by the master, a manifestation of responsibility for the drama. Originally, the person in charge of the stage was backstage, usually inside the stage door, to support and take care of the actor's performance. Now it is more appropriately called "Stage Supervisor". However, now some stage managers actually show up on the stage, and some even stand in front of the stage, looking around proudly, and advertising widely: So-and-so is personally in charge of the stage. This is not good. This is more unreasonable than the appearance of the stagehands.
            Sixteenth, Grabbing Gags and Making People Laugh
    It is also a bad phenomenon for actors to grab gags. As a result, it either distorts history or slanders reality. When someone plays Wang Po, when she colludes with Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing, she introduces them like this: "This is Comrade Ximen Qing" and "This is Comrade Pan." It is really boring for Chong Gongdao to say things like: "I am so-and-so's godfather!" What is even worse is that some people perform "Creek Emperor Village" and the female roles are frivolous with each other, saying: "Don't underestimate her! She has been stamped by foreigners!" What does this mean! Is it that being insulted by imperialism is considered a glorious gift! This self-deprecating attitude cannot be tolerated. Today's society has completely changed, and the audience has completely changed. They demand that patriotism be expressed everywhere in art. Our artists were oppressed by the three great mountains of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism in the old society. They were so oppressed that they could not turn over or lift their heads. Some people even had to cater to the low tastes of the reactionary class. But today is the era of people's liberation, and artists have turned over and are loved and respected by the people. Therefore, they must lift their heads, respect themselves, and love themselves. However, some people are still self-deprecating even today, and even compare themselves to turtles on stage and curse themselves as worthless, with the purpose of winning a smile from a few backward audiences. This cannot be tolerated. I believe that the fundamental reason for unprincipled grabbing of gags and low-level jokes is the result of artists not studying politically, which should be changed quickly.
            Seventeenth, Vulgar Gimmicks
    Some troupes improperly arrange sets and props, showing off their strangeness and victory with "real snakes on stage", "real cattle on stage", etc. This style is not good. The "Tianhe Match" performed by the Li Wanchun Troupe this year, in addition to "real wells and real water, fire from empty basins, lotus flowers all over the stage, magpies all over the stage, Weaver Girl swimming, watermelon piles of characters, real birds on stage, real cattle on stage..." also has "real background" plus film screenings, which can be said to be the most typical example. I remember that a troupe in Beijing performed "Tianhe Match" last year, and it was also "real cattle on stage." After the cowherd finished singing Daoban inside, the cow did not come out when he went on stage. Several stagehands pushed the cow's butt out. The cowherd sang half of "Wawa Tune" and was dragged back by the cow. So the stagehands used force to push it out again. The cow was frightened and restless on the stage, and finally defecated a pile of feces. The stagehands quickly took out a dustpan and broom to sweep away the feces! The stage was extremely embarrassed, and the audience laughed! When leaving the stage, the cow would not leave the stage again, and the stagehands still used force to push it in. May I ask, does such "real cattle on stage" help the performance of the drama, or does it destroy the performance of the drama? Is it really as some people say: "In the mountains and rivers, the real cattle appear, which is extremely beautiful and very freehand!" General Peking opera performances rely on real objects, such as writing with a pen, drinking with a cup, rowing with a paddle, and killing with a knife, but isn't there already a big difference between all these and real things! This is to artistically exaggerate or beautify the real things according to the conditions and needs of the stage. Some things that cannot be expressed on stage are never forced to be expressed. For example, if "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger" also has "real tiger on stage", then I am very worried that "the tiger will eat Wu Song". For example, Peking opera performs riding a horse, only using a horsewhip and using dance to express the riding posture, never "real horse on stage". If someone insists on using "real horse on stage", it will become a circus. For example, if a marshal and eight generals are on horseback at the same time, please ask, how can this stage be able to accommodate it! The proper use of scenery and props undoubtedly helps the performance of the drama. Improper use of it often causes serious damage to art! So I think that arrangements such as "real cattle on stage" and "added film screenings" are the same vulgar gimmicks as installing nickel-plated spinning wheels with electric lights in "Spinning Cotton", and are by no means art. It makes the stage chaotic, destroys the plot, damages the art, is a regressive tendency, and is not the correct path, which should be corrected.
    The performance methods, attitudes, and styles of old opera, that is, the various barbaric, terrifying, obscene, slavish, and vulgar expressions that exist in the backward aspects of the stage image, are as described above. All of these politically insult one's own nation and hurt the self-esteem of our Chinese people; artistically, they make the Chinese opera art with excellent traditions suffer dust. Opera reform work certainly focuses on improving the ideological content, but if the dirty dust on the face is not wiped clean, it is impossible to make the face of Chinese opera reach a healthy and perfect state!
    Therefore, every drama worker with patriotic ideas should be duty-bound to raise the work of clarifying the stage image to the principle of patriotism for understanding and practice without hesitation. I think that signing a patriotic convention should be one of the important contents.
    Naturally, clarifying the stage image is also an extremely serious and meticulous work. It is necessary to analyze concretely according to scientific attitudes, and must not be hasty and reckless. The existing backward stage images can be roughly divided into two categories in terms of treatment: one is to eliminate them without reservation, as mentioned above; the other is to selectively discard them after scientific analysis, such as deleting the phenomenon of cruel torture, which refers to those who are cruelly tortured, such as the separation of the head and body, the beating of blood and flesh, as well as the scorches, oil pans, scorpion pools, skinning, knife chopping on the face, nailing into the top of the head, cutting open the chest and gouging out the heart, and dissecting the abdomen to test flowers. It is not to eradicate the use of torture on stage, the question is to avoid the brutal and terrifying influence and achieve the due effect of drama. That is to say, to see if it is used accurately and appropriately. The improvement of facial makeup is also to remove the dross and keep the essence, not to abolish it indiscriminately; kowtowing is also to reduce it as much as possible, not to kneel and worship on the stage at all; braids are a shameful symbol of national oppression, there is no need to show off in every way, but it is not to say that Wu Sangui and Zeng Guofan should not keep braids either. Shi Dakai, Wei Changhui and others grew their hair before the Jintian Village Uprising. As for the improvement of martial arts, costumes, and colored heads, we should preserve and develop their basic excellent achievements, and modify or abolish their backward and ugly parts. The first category mentioned above needs to be resolutely changed, while the second category needs to be carefully changed. Hesitation and carelessness are wrong attitudes to all work, and the opera reform work will naturally be no exception. Even a moment of carelessness will produce bad results!
    In the above situation, due to the opera reform work in the past two years, many changes have been made, and some new healthy and beautiful images worthy of attention have begun to be created. However, the fact that many morbid, ugly, and distorted stage images still exist to some extent, and even seriously, on some stages is still a fact that cannot be ignored.
    Our opera circles not only need to strive for the health, beauty, and correctness of the ideological content of opera, but also must strive for the health, beauty, and correctness of the stage image at the same time!
    Therefore, every drama worker with patriotic ideas should be duty-bound to recognize and practice the work of clarifying the stage image from the principle of patriotism without hesitation. I think that the signing of the patriotic convention should be one of the important contents.
