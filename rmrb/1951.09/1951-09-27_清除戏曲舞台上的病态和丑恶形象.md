    Eliminating Morbid and Ugly Images on the Opera Stage
    Ma Shaobo
    The stage images of Chinese opera have a healthy, beautiful, and correct side; they also have a morbid, ugly, and distorted side. Although the health or morbidity, beauty or ugliness, correctness or distortion of opera primarily lie in its ideological content, they must be expressed through corresponding images. What are the morbid, ugly, and distorted images on the old opera stage?
            First, Bound Feet
    The stage presentation of bound feet mainly involves "qiao gong" (literally "stilts work", referring to the special shoes and gait of women with bound feet). This is a concentrated expression of the historical oppression and humiliation of Chinese women, resulting in physical disability. The barbaric destruction of women by feudal rulers is a stain on the history of our Chinese nation and should not be artistically represented at all, let alone appreciated as art. Some people say, "Qiao gong cannot be changed, small feet are very beautiful." This undoubtedly reflects the thinking of the feudal ruling class. This kind of thinking is absolutely unacceptable. After abolishing "qiao", some people worry that the dance movements of female roles will become stiff as a result. This concern is also superfluous. Many actors have not practiced "qiao gong", but their movements are not ugly or stiff; on the contrary, they are very healthy and natural. Some people say: "I used to practice 'qiao gong' and suffered a lot, and the audience welcomed us very much; now that I don't wear 'qiao', will the audience not welcome us?" This kind of thinking is also wrong. Mr. Wang Yaoqing and Mr. Mei Lanfang voluntarily abolished "qiao gong" very early on, and the audience has always welcomed them!
    It is undoubtedly correct that small feet should not be represented, and "qiao gong" should be abolished. Therefore, the small-foot shoe vamps used in plays such as "Picking up the Jade Bracelet" to demonstrate needlework should naturally be changed. Wouldn't it be perfectly acceptable to change this to making clothes? Furthermore, phrases in drum lyrics that praise "golden lotuses" and "lotus steps" should also be deleted or revised.
        Second, Lewdness and Obscenity
    This means that some actors perform expressions of love between men and women in a very vulgar manner. "Feet picking and eyes moving," wearing fake nipples, wearing a dudou (a traditional Chinese undergarment), shaking bed curtains, and pointing two index fingers up and down; such as the obscene and vulgar language in "Iron Bow Marriage" during the "matching up" and "jealousy" scenes; some actors prominently and exaggeratedly portray the psychology of spring fever on stage, as in plays such as "Hong Niang," "Great Splitting Coffin," "Battle of Wancheng," and "Widow Ma Opens a Shop." This kind of obscene performance, although mainly determined by the script, the actor's performance method and attitude often play a decisive role. Some actors also perform "Yutangchun" and "Imperial Stele Pavilion" with exaggerated expressions and unseemly lewdness, catering to the low tastes of some backward audiences. The actors themselves are delighted when they hear these backward audiences cheering and applauding, and they are not ashamed! This kind of performance is harmful and must be reformed.
            Third, Superstition and Terror
        "Exploring Yin Mountain" and "Touring the Six Palaces" are the most typical examples. These plays mainly promote "cyclic retribution", terrifying and fooling the people through the images of evil spirits and ghosts in the underworld. Some people say: "Sun Wukong causing havoc in the Heavenly Palace can be performed, why can't causing havoc in the Underworld be performed?" We believe that the Underworld will only produce the effect of terror and superstition and should not be put on stage. Some viewers in the past had superstitious ideas, and seeing these concrete images of Black and White Impermanence, Ox-Head and Horse-Face, etc., will only deepen their impressions, even mistakenly believing in their real existence; young people and children who were previously unaware of the "Underworld" will inevitably have a shadow of superstition cast on their minds, which is absolutely unacceptable!
    Some people say: "To break superstition, we must specifically perform superstitious images and openly criticize them." This is obviously wrong. Because the Underworld is only a feudal and backward ideology, not an objective existence, how can putting these superstitious images on stage have the effect of breaking superstition! We have no reason to put these superstitious and terrifying images on the people's stage again. It is reasonable to resolutely eliminate it. For example, in the play "Zhong Kui," the hanged ghost, the shoe ghost, the big-head ghost, and the small-head ghost fill the stage with a ghastly atmosphere and ghostly shadows. This must be resolutely abolished.
        Fourth, Cruel Torture and Murder
    There are also many performances of cruel punishments and barbaric killings in operas, such as the rolling on nail boards in "Nine Watch Nights," the opening of the guillotine in "The Case of Chen Shimei," the skinning in "Fengbo Pavilion," the breaking of the belly and flowing of intestines in "Jiepai Pass," the cutting open of the chest and gouging out of the heart and eye-scorching in "King Zhou and Daji," Li Gang beating the court in "Qingyang Map," tearing off the legs of the treacherous Ma Lan; Yao Gang in "Huang Yidao" cutting off a woman's leg and using it as a combat weapon, even putting the small foot of the severed limb to his nose to smell! Dian Wei in "Battle of Wancheng" using two corpses to replace weapons, Yan Peizhang in "Five Martyrs" catching the enemy and gouging out his eyes and eating them. There are also performances in some black shop dramas of slaughtering people like cattle and sheep, wrapping human meat into dumplings. Performances such as these must be resolutely abolished.
        Fifth, Spanking
    Spanking realistically on stage is also very ugly. In "Rainbow Pass," making jokes while spanking is the most typical bad example; the image of crawling on a bench to be beaten in "Double Afraid Wife" seriously hurts national self-esteem! Of course, spanking is a type of ancient Chinese punishment, and it can be said to be the most common; however, this ugly image has been used by British and American imperialists as a laughing stock to distort and ridicule the Chinese people. We believe that spanking should generally not be done on stage and can be moved to backstage, such as the beating of Xiao En in "Fishing and Killing the Family" and the beating of Wang Ping in "Cutting Ma Su." These are all handled very well. In fact, moving the beating backstage not only does not harm the plot but also strengthens the depth of the performance. Because it is necessary to explain the reality of having been punished, the actor must strengthen the depth of the performance through singing, words, and expressions. The performance of Xiao En in the section "Angry with that Lü Ziqiu" is like this.
            Sixth, Kowtowing
    Kowtowing is a type of ancient Chinese etiquette, but this etiquette is mostly used by subordinates to superiors, especially by the oppressed to the oppressors. On stage, the image of the laboring people kowtowing like pounding garlic is often portrayed. The oppressors will never show "Please accept my bow" to the oppressed, unless they are in dire straits and beg the oppressed to die in their place (such as "A Pinch of Snow").
    On the opera stage, the laboring people kowtowing to the reactionary feudal rulers happens far too often! For example, in "June Snow," Dou E suffered such a deep and unjust grievance that she still had to kneel and bow to the executioner when she was executed, which is truly embarrassing.
        Seventh, Braids
    Men shaving their heads and wearing braids was a shameful symbol left over from the Manchu era for national oppression and assimilation of the Han people. Before the Manchu army entered the Pass, they began to force the Han people to submit and surrender, using shaving the head as a sign of surrender. The order was: "People in all places outside the city should quickly shave their heads and surrender. Those who are willing to shave their heads and surrender should come to pay their respects to the Emperor!..." (See Secret Records of Manchu Archives). After entering the Pass, during the Shunzhi period, the head-shaving order became even stricter, such as: "...Now inside and outside is one family, the ruler is like a father, and the people are like sons. Father and son are one body, how can they be different? If they are not unified, they will ultimately be of two minds, would they not almost be people of a foreign country?... From now on, after the announcement, inside and outside the capital, the time limit is ten days. In the provinces directly under the jurisdiction, the time limit is also ten days after the official documents arrive. All must be ordered to shave their heads! Those who comply are the people of our country, and those who hesitate are the rebels who disobey the orders and will be severely punished. Those who avoid and cherish their hair and argue with clever words will never be lightly forgiven! The local civil and military officials must strictly inspect and verify, and those who repeatedly submit memorials on this matter, wanting to retain the Ming system in the areas that have been determined and not follow the system of our dynasty, will be killed without pardon." (See Complete Account of the Manchus Deceiving the Chinese). It can be seen how severely the Han people suffered under the forced surrender order of "Keep the hair, lose the head; keep the head, lose the hair." Therefore, this is by no means a matter of custom, but a shameful symbol of national oppression.
        Eighth, Unscientific Martial Arts
    Martial arts are inherently dangerous, but as a result of long-term hard study and practice, the danger will be avoided considerably because of accuracy. The tradition of diligence, bravery, and hard work of the Chinese people is also reflected in the martial arts of opera. They will never shrink back due to the danger. But this refers to the general situation of practicing martial arts; as for individual martial arts that are very dangerous, very barbaric and cruel, harmful to the health of actors, and very ugly in image, such as ankle-breaking and somersaulting in the clouds, they should be resolutely eliminated. Another type is martial arts performance that is divorced from the plot, such as the performance of street performance in "Four Heroes Village." Compared with the performance of "San Cha Kou" where martial arts are closely integrated with the plot, the failure and success are most obvious. Furthermore, the way of fighting is extremely unrealistic. I think it can be researched and improved to integrate it well with the plot, that is to say, to make it truly a dramatic art. If it is impossible to combine with the plot, it is best to put it in the acrobatic troupe in order to preserve this skill. Because fighting on stage, despite the need for artistic exaggeration, must always conform to reality. It is absolutely impossible for the two sides to exchange weapons in turn like a game. Some people say: This is a performance of fighting, then this performance is not like the situation described in old novels, and what is the meaning of performing "fighting"! In addition, such as
    "Comical Fighting," "Somersaulting Over the City," etc., are not correct performance methods and often degenerate into vulgarity. Even general performances are often like this. When expressing thinking or anxiety, they always tap the forehead lightly with their fingers. This is reasonable, but in this case, the actors always have subordinate movements, such as rubbing the buttocks while tapping the forehead. What does this mean! This type of ugly performance format is certainly unrelated to martial arts, but it should also be studied and revised.
            Ninth, Blowing the Nose
    Blowing one's nose on stage is an expression of extremely dirty and backward habits. The most typical example is in "Double Shake Association", where someone blows his nose, and
    another person said: "Don't throw away the snot! This thing is better than a magical elixir, it can nourish yin, strengthen the kidneys, and replenish vitality!" This kind of boring banter simply causes people's physiological nausea. It is also a bad habit for some actors to spit on the stage at will. In addition, performing urination, defecation, drinking urine, and eating feces on the opera stage is really extremely dirty! I think this kind of performance should be eliminated. The act of blowing one's nose when groping in the dark in dramas such as "Daming Mansion," "Erlong Mountain"
    "Clever Chain" and "Cross Slope" should also be changed.
        Tenth, Ugly Facial Makeup
    The facial makeup of Chinese opera should not be completely obliterated. Its origin, it is said, dates back to the early days of Tang and Song dynasty drama. The shows were performed in public squares. In order to help the audience recognize the faces of the characters and distinguish their personalities, it gradually developed. This exaggerated technique is not only found in facial makeup, but also in the music, singing, recitative, dance, and costumes of opera. This is an important indication that Chinese opera came from the people, from the fields to the court. Facial makeup is basically acceptable. However, some facial makeups are really too ferocious and ugly, such as "broken face," "crooked face," "ghost face," the intricately complex "three-piece tile flower," insulting the laboring people's
    "tofu block" etc. In addition, there are those with feudal superstitious components, such as the crescent moon on Bao Zheng's facial makeup (symbolizing judgment of the underworld at night), the dragon shape under Zhao Kuangyin's facial makeup left eyebrow (symbolizing imperial status), the Tai Chi diagram on Jiang Wei's facial makeup (indicating that Jiang Wei is good at using yin and yang eight trigrams), and the tiger character on Yang Qilang's facial makeup (symbolizing the descent of the Black Tiger) etc. All of these should be appropriately deleted, simplified, or modified according to specific circumstances.
        Eleventh, Unreasonable Costumes
    The costumes of old operas generally lack a precise costume design system due to the lack of directing work, so they are often dressed very unreasonably. The play tells the story of Qin, Han, Tang, Song, and Ming, but there are often characters wearing Manchu costumes appearing on stage. It is difficult to distinguish the changes in Chinese historical costumes very specifically and accurately on stage, but it is always possible to achieve a general distinction at present. It is said that dressing yamen runners, prison guards, escorts, procuresses, lo mao (a derogatory term for foreign devils), and even blind people and doctors in Qing costumes is to show contempt for these people; even so, this should be fundamentally changed now. Because such a performance is completely meaningless and is only an unnecessary and unwarranted insult; moreover, the contempt for these people at that time was clearly the view of the feudal ruling class. To take a step back, even if these people are not good, are they not worse than reactionary rulers who eat people! Moreover, some of them, such as blind people, are an unfortunate physiological disability, and if this contemptuous meaning is still retained in the appearance, it would be a great insult and injury.
        Twelfth, Stagehands
    This is a backward phenomenon that has existed in the style of Chinese opera stage for many years. The stage performances are historical stories and ancient characters, but letting modern characters, or green-clothed small hats, or bald-headed short jackets, or cadre uniforms, appear on the stage makes the ancient and modern times chaotic on one stage, which not only destroys the plot but also seriously damages the integrity of the art form. Therefore, I believe that in order to maintain the cleanliness and perfection of the stage image and the formality and seriousness of the stage style, stagehands must be hidden. Many newly compiled dramas have already done this completely. It is not very difficult to avoid stagehands appearing on the stage in old dramas either. Stagehands have only two main tasks on stage: one is to arrange tables and chairs; the other is to help actors change costumes and remove headdresses on the spot. It is not very difficult to change these tasks. It is also really unreasonable for the characters in the play to have to fly over a cushion when kneeling and bowing. According to my guess, probably when performing in the countryside, the stage was made of earth or wooden boards, and kneeling down would easily get the clothes dirty, so it was always necessary to lay a cushion when kneeling, bowing, or falling. This is completely reasonable; today, when performing in the theater, the stage is covered with carpets, and it is still necessary to fly the cushion, which is completely unnecessary.
    I say this not because I don't want stagehands and stagehand work, but only to ask that this work be placed behind the scenes. The work of stagehands is part of the stage work, it is the work of the backstage, and it should not be seen by the audience. As long as you use your brain more, the difficulties can be completely overcome.
    We have been brewing the problem of hiding stagehands in the opera stage for many years, and we have also made some attempts. It should be said that we have had successful experiences. In the past, some people said that "the play cannot be performed" or "the audience will not accept it" if the stagehands do not appear, but now facts have given strong persuasion. After the play starts, no one except the characters in the play should show up and run around on the stage. The band also finds a way to hide, so that the stage will be clean, reasonable, and perfect.
            Thirteenth, Walking Corpses
    In old opera performances, it is common to see people come back to life after they die. After a character dies, the actor gets up and leaves the stage in the identity of the actor. After Jiao Bing and Murong Lie in "Yangping Pass" are stabbed to death by Zhao Yun, they actually perform "returning to the yang world" and leave the stage. It is said that there is such a joke in a certain city: After a strong man killed a corrupt official, he ordered him: "Corpse, retreat!" So the corpse obediently stood up, made a face to the audience, and retreated according to orders. This is the so-called walking corpse. The unreasonableness of this performance is self-evident. Don't think that the audience is used to it and that you can just stick to your old ways and not make reforms.
            Fourteenth, Drinking on Stage
    Drinking on stage naturally has its reasons: to protect the voice. However, there will not be too much singing work in each play. Is it possible to drink water after leaving the stage? I think it is completely possible. In "Three Halls Trial," the singing work of the female role is very heavy. We have had many comrades and actors do experiments. It is completely possible not to drink water. This is just a matter of habit. Undoubtedly, drinking on stage also destroys the plot. In short, drinking and stagehands have the same bad effects of interrupting the plot and making the stage chaotic, which should be resolutely avoided.
        Fifteenth, Stage Manager
    The stage manager was originally a kind of supervision of the performance of the apprentice by the master, a manifestation of responsibility for the drama. Originally, the person in charge of the stage was backstage, usually inside the stage door, to support and take care of the actor's performance. Now it is more appropriately called "Stage Supervisor". However, now some stage managers actually show up on the stage, and some even stand in front of the stage, looking around proudly, and advertising widely: So-and-so is personally in charge of the stage. This is not good. This is more unreasonable than the appearance of the stagehands.
            Sixteenth, Grabbing Gags and Making People Laugh
    It is also a bad phenomenon for actors to grab gags. As a result, it either distorts history or slanders reality. When someone plays Wang Po, when she colludes with Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing, she introduces them like this: "This is Comrade Ximen Qing" and "This is Comrade Pan." It is really boring for Chong Gongdao to say things like: "I am so-and-so's godfather!" What is even worse is that some people perform "Creek Emperor Village" and the female roles are frivolous with each other, saying: "Don't underestimate her! She has been stamped by foreigners!" What does this mean! Is it that being insulted by imperialism is considered a glorious gift! This self-deprecating attitude cannot be tolerated. Today's society has completely changed, and the audience has completely changed. They demand that patriotism be expressed everywhere in art. Our artists were oppressed by the three great mountains of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism in the old society. They were so oppressed that they could not turn over or lift their heads. Some people even had to cater to the low tastes of the reactionary class. But today is the era of people's liberation, and artists have turned over and are loved and respected by the people. Therefore, they must lift their heads, respect themselves, and love themselves. However, some people are still self-deprecating even today, and even compare themselves to turtles on stage and curse themselves as worthless, with the purpose of winning a smile from a few backward audiences. This cannot be tolerated. I believe that the fundamental reason for unprincipled grabbing of gags and low-level jokes is the result of artists not studying politically, which should be changed quickly.
            Seventeenth, Vulgar Gimmicks
    Some troupes improperly arrange sets and props, showing off their strangeness and victory with "real snakes on stage", "real cattle on stage", etc. This style is not good. The "Tianhe Match" performed by the Li Wanchun Troupe this year, in addition to "real wells and real water, fire from empty basins, lotus flowers all over the stage, magpies all over the stage, Weaver Girl swimming, watermelon piles of characters, real birds on stage, real cattle on stage..." also has "real background" plus film screenings, which can be said to be the most typical example. I remember that a troupe in Beijing performed "Tianhe Match" last year, and it was also "real cattle on stage." After the cowherd finished singing Daoban inside, the cow did not come out when he went on stage. Several stagehands pushed the cow's butt out. The cowherd sang half of "Wawa Tune" and was dragged back by the cow. So the stagehands used force to push it out again. The cow was frightened and restless on the stage, and finally defecated a pile of feces. The stagehands quickly took out a dustpan and broom to sweep away the feces! The stage was extremely embarrassed, and the audience laughed! When leaving the stage, the cow would not leave the stage again, and the stagehands still used force to push it in. May I ask, does such "real cattle on stage" help the performance of the drama, or does it destroy the performance of the drama? Is it really as some people say: "In the mountains and rivers, the real cattle appear, which is extremely beautiful and very freehand!" General Peking opera performances rely on real objects, such as writing with a pen, drinking with a cup, rowing with a paddle, and killing with a knife, but isn't there already a big difference between all these and real things! This is to artistically exaggerate or beautify the real things according to the conditions and needs of the stage. Some things that cannot be expressed on stage are never forced to be expressed. For example, if "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger" also has "real tiger on stage", then I am very worried that "the tiger will eat Wu Song". For example, Peking opera performs riding a horse, only using a horsewhip and using dance to express the riding posture, never "real horse on stage". If someone insists on using "real horse on stage", it will become a circus. For example, if a marshal and eight generals are on horseback at the same time, please ask, how can this stage be able to accommodate it! The proper use of scenery and props undoubtedly helps the performance of the drama. Improper use of it often causes serious damage to art! So I think that arrangements such as "real cattle on stage" and "added film screenings" are the same vulgar gimmicks as installing nickel-plated spinning wheels with electric lights in "Spinning Cotton", and are by no means art. It makes the stage chaotic, destroys the plot, damages the art, is a regressive tendency, and is not the correct path, which should be corrected.
    The performance methods, attitudes, and styles of old opera, that is, the various barbaric, terrifying, obscene, slavish, and vulgar expressions that exist in the backward aspects of the stage image, are as described above. All of these politically insult one's own nation and hurt the self-esteem of our Chinese people; artistically, they make the Chinese opera art with excellent traditions suffer dust. Opera reform work certainly focuses on improving the ideological content, but if the dirty dust on the face is not wiped clean, it is impossible to make the face of Chinese opera reach a healthy and perfect state!
    Therefore, every drama worker with patriotic ideas should be duty-bound to raise the work of clarifying the stage image to the principle of patriotism for understanding and practice without hesitation. I think that signing a patriotic convention should be one of the important contents.
    Naturally, clarifying the stage image is also an extremely serious and meticulous work. It is necessary to analyze concretely according to scientific attitudes, and must not be hasty and reckless. The existing backward stage images can be roughly divided into two categories in terms of treatment: one is to eliminate them without reservation, as mentioned above; the other is to selectively discard them after scientific analysis, such as deleting the phenomenon of cruel torture, which refers to those who are cruelly tortured, such as the separation of the head and body, the beating of blood and flesh, as well as the scorches, oil pans, scorpion pools, skinning, knife chopping on the face, nailing into the top of the head, cutting open the chest and gouging out the heart, and dissecting the abdomen to test flowers. It is not to eradicate the use of torture on stage, the question is to avoid the brutal and terrifying influence and achieve the due effect of drama. That is to say, to see if it is used accurately and appropriately. The improvement of facial makeup is also to remove the dross and keep the essence, not to abolish it indiscriminately; kowtowing is also to reduce it as much as possible, not to kneel and worship on the stage at all; braids are a shameful symbol of national oppression, there is no need to show off in every way, but it is not to say that Wu Sangui and Zeng Guofan should not keep braids either. Shi Dakai, Wei Changhui and others grew their hair before the Jintian Village Uprising. As for the improvement of martial arts, costumes, and colored heads, we should preserve and develop their basic excellent achievements, and modify or abolish their backward and ugly parts. The first category mentioned above needs to be resolutely changed, while the second category needs to be carefully changed. Hesitation and carelessness are wrong attitudes to all work, and the opera reform work will naturally be no exception. Even a moment of carelessness will produce bad results!
    In the above situation, due to the opera reform work in the past two years, many changes have been made, and some new healthy and beautiful images worthy of attention have begun to be created. However, the fact that many morbid, ugly, and distorted stage images still exist to some extent, and even seriously, on some stages is still a fact that cannot be ignored.
    Our opera circles not only need to strive for the health, beauty, and correctness of the ideological content of opera, but also must strive for the health, beauty, and correctness of the stage image at the same time!
    Therefore, every drama worker with patriotic ideas should be duty-bound to recognize and practice the work of clarifying the stage image from the principle of patriotism without hesitation. I think that the signing of the patriotic convention should be one of the important contents.

### 清除戏曲舞台上的病态和丑恶形象

    清除戏曲舞台上的病态和丑恶形象
    马少波
    中国戏曲的舞台形象，有它的健康、美丽、正确的一面；也有它的病态、丑恶、歪曲的一面。虽然戏曲的健康或病态，美丽或丑恶，正确或歪曲，主要是在于它的思想内容；但是却必然要通过相应的形象表现出来。旧剧舞台有那些病态的、丑恶的、歪曲的形象呢？
            第一、小脚
    舞台上表现小脚主要的是跷工。这是集中地表现中国历史上妇女被压迫被屈辱以致生理残废的病态。封建统治者野蛮地摧残妇女，是我们中华民族历史中的一个污点，根本不应把它通过艺术来表现，更不应该当作艺术来欣赏。有的人说，“跷工改不得，小脚很好看”。这无疑的是封建统治阶级思想的反映。这种思想是绝对要不得的。废跷以后，有人耽心旦角舞蹈的身段，会因而僵硬起来，这种顾虑，也是多余的。有好多演员并没有练过跷工，而身段并不难看，也并不僵硬，相反地倒很健康自然。有的人说：“我过去练跷工，吃了很多苦，观众对我们很欢迎；现在不踩跷了，观众会不会不欢迎了呢？”这种想法也是错误的。王瑶卿、梅兰芳先生都是从很早就自动地废了跷工的，观众不是一直欢迎他们么！
    不应该表现小脚，跷工应该废掉，是无疑的了。因此，“拾玉镯”等剧表演女红的小脚鞋帮，自然也应该改掉，在这里改成做衣服，不是完全可以的么！再如鼓词中歌颂“金莲”、“莲步”之类的词句，也应该删改。
        第二、淫荡猥亵
    这就是说，有的演员表演男女情爱十分下流。“足挑目动”、戴奶头、戴肚兜、摇帐子、两个食指比上比下；如“铁弓缘”中的“配上”“吃醋”之类的淫词秽语；有的演员在舞台上突出地夸张地刻划思春心理，如“红娘”“大劈棺”“战宛城”“马寡妇开店”等剧，都有这种情况。这种淫亵的表演，虽然主要是决定于剧本，但是演员表演方法和表演态度，也往往有其决定的作用。有的演员演“玉堂春”“御碑亭”也演得眉飞色舞，淫荡之状不堪入目，以此迎合某些落后观众的低级趣味，演员本身听到这些落后观众的起哄喝采，反而欣然自得，不以为羞！这种表演是有害的，必须改革。
            第三、迷信恐怖
        “探阴山”“游六殿”是最典型的例子。这类戏主要是宣传“循环报应”，通过阴曹地府厉魂恶鬼的形象，恐吓人民，愚弄人民。有的人说：孙悟空闹天宫可以演，为什么闹地府不能演呢？我们认为阴曹地府，只会发生恐怖迷信的效果，不应搬上舞台。部分观众过去就有迷信思想，看到这些黑白无常、牛头马面之类的具体形象，只有使他加深了印象，甚至误信其真实存在；过去对“阴曹地府”毫无所知的青年和小孩子们看了，也必然在他们的心灵上，罩上迷信的暗影，这是绝对要不得的！
    有人说：“要破除迷信，必须把迷信的形象具体地表演，公开地批判。”显然这是错误的。因为阴曹地府只是封建落后的意识形态，并不是客观存在，把这些迷信的形象搬演出来，如何会收到破除迷信的效果呢！我们没有任何理由再要把这些迷信恐怖的形象在人民的舞台上搬现。把它坚决革除，是合理的事。如演“钟馗”一剧，吊死鬼、靴子鬼、大头鬼、小头鬼，满台是鬼，真是鬼气森森，鬼影幢幢。这是必须坚决废除的。
        第四、酷刑凶杀
    戏曲中表现残酷的刑罚和野蛮的杀害也是不少的，如“九更天”中的滚钉板、“铡美案”中的开铡、“风波亭”中的剥皮、“界牌关”中的肚破肠流、“纣王与妲己”中的开膛剜心，炮烙剜眼，“庆阳图”中的李刚打朝，把奸佞马兰的腿撕断；“黄一刀”中的姚刚把女人的腿劈断，当作战斗的武器，甚至把断肢的小脚，放到鼻子上闻臭！“战宛城”中的典韦拿两个尸体代替兵器，“五人义”中的颜佩章捉住敌人剜出眼珠，并且吃掉。还有在一些开黑店的戏中表演把人和牛羊一样宰割，包人肉扁食，诸如此类的表演是必须坚决废除的。
        第五、打屁股
    在台上一五一十地打屁股，也是非常丑恶的。如“虹霓关”中，打着屁股开玩笑，是最典型的坏例子；“双怕婆”中爬在板凳上挨打的形象，是多么严重地伤害着民族的自尊心！固然，打屁股是中国古代刑罚的一种，也可以说是最普通的一种；但是，这种丑恶的形象，曾经被英美帝国主义者拿来作为歪曲与讥讽中国人民的笑柄。我们认为一般不应在台上打，可以移到暗场去打，如“打渔杀家”之打萧恩，“斩马谡”之打王平，都是处理得很好的。其实移在暗场打，非但于剧情无损，反而加强了表演的深刻性，由于需要交代受过刑的真实，演员就必须从唱词、从表情加强表演的深度。如萧恩
    “恼恨那吕子秋”的一段表演，就是这样的。
            第六、磕头
    磕头是中国古代的一种礼节，但是这种礼节多是用在下对上，特别是被压迫者对压迫者。在舞台上常常表现劳动人民叩头如捣蒜的形象。压迫者对被压迫者，除非在万分急难之中乞求被压迫者为他替死的时候，是决不会表现“请上受我一拜”的（如“一捧雪”）。
    在戏曲舞台上劳动人民给反动的封建统治者磕头实在出现得太多！比如“六月雪”，窦娥蒙了那样深沉的不白之冤，就刑的时候，还要给刽子手跪拜，这实在是难堪的。
        第七、辫子
    男子剃发留辫子，是满清时代为了民族压迫，同化汉族留下来的一种可耻的记号。满军入关之前，就开始强迫汉人屈服降顺，以剃发作为归降的标志，如下令：“外城各地方之人速宜剃发归降，凡愿剃发归降者，宜来叩见皇上！……”（见满清卷档秘录）。入关之后到顺治年间，剃发令更严，如：“……今中外一家，君犹父也，民犹子也，父子一体，岂可违异；若不划一，终属二心，不几为异国之人乎？……自今布告之后，京城内外，限旬日，直隶各省地方，自部文到后亦限旬日，尽令剃发！遵依者为我国之民，迟疑者同逆命之寇，必置重罪。若规避惜发，巧辞争辩，决不轻贷！该地方文武各官，皆当严行察验，若有复为此事渎进冒奏，欲将已定地方仍存明制，不随本朝制度者，杀无赦”。（见满夷猾夏始末记）。可见在“留发不留头，留头不留发”的逼降令之下，汉族人民遭受了如何严重的凌辱。因此，这决不是什么习俗问题，而是民族压迫的一种可耻的标志。
        第八、不科学的武工
    武工本身是带有危险性的，但是长期的苦学苦练的结果，会因准确而相当地避免了危险。中国人民勤劳勇敢的传统，反映在戏曲的武工中也是如此，绝不会因有危险性而就退缩不前。但是这是指一般的练工情况；至于个别的，十分危险、十分野蛮残酷、伤害演员健康的、形象非常丑恶的武工，如摔踝子、云里翻之类，则应坚决革除。另一种是脱离剧情的武工表演，如“四杰村”卖艺式的表演，这和“三岔口”武功紧密结合剧情的表演，对照起来，失败与成功，最为明显。再如打出手，表演战斗极不真实，我想，还是可以研究改进，使其很好地结合剧情，也就是说，使其真正成为戏剧艺术。如果结合剧情不可能，为了保留这种技艺，最好放到杂技团里去。因为舞台上打仗，尽管需要艺术上的夸张，也总得符合真实，决不可能敌我两方，游戏一样地轮流交换武器。有人说：这是表现斗法，那么这样表现也并不像旧说部所描写的那样的情况，而且表现“斗法”又有什么意义呢！此外，如
    “滑稽开打”，“跟斗过城”等等，都不是正确的表演方法，常常流于庸俗。即如一般的表演，也往往如此，表现思考或者焦虑的时候，总是用手指轻弹前额，这是合理的，但是遇到这种情况，演员总是有从属性的动作，如一面弹额，一面揉摩屁股，这有什么意思呢！这一类的丑化的表演格式，当然与武工无关，但也应该加以研究修改。
            第九、擤鼻涕
    舞台上的擤鼻涕，是一种极肮脏落后习惯的表现。最典型的例子是在“双摇会”中，有人擤鼻涕，另
    一人则说：“鼻涕不要丢了！这个玩意儿胜过灵丹圣药，可以滋阴健肾补元气！”这种无聊的插科打诨简直引起人们生理上的恶心了。有的演员在台上随地吐痰，也是不好的习惯。此外，在戏曲舞台上表演撒尿屙屎、喝尿吃屎，实在是肮脏之极！我以为这种表演，都应该革除。“大名府”“二龙山”
    “巧连环”“十字坡”等剧中摸黑时的擤鼻涕的动作，也应该改掉。
        第十、丑恶的脸谱
    中国戏曲的脸谱不应该一律抹煞。它的来源，据说是从唐宋戏剧发韧时期起，在广场里演戏，为了帮助观众认清角色面目，辨别人物性格，逐渐发展而来的。这种夸张手法，不仅脸谱，戏曲的音乐、歌唱、念白、舞蹈、服装都有着这一共同特点，这是中国戏曲来自民间从田野到庙堂的重要轨迹。脸谱基本是可以采用的。然而，有些脸谱，实在是过于狰狞和丑化，如“破脸”“歪脸”“鬼脸”，构图琐碎复杂的“花三块瓦”，侮辱劳动人民的
    “豆腐块”等等；再则是带有封建迷信成分的，如包拯脸谱的月牙（象征夜断阴）、赵匡胤脸谱左眉下的龙形（象征帝王身份）、姜维脸谱的太极图（表明姜维善用阴阳八卦）、杨七郎脸谱的虎字（象征黑虎下凡）等等，这一切均应根据具体情况适当的删除，或是简化，或者修改。
        第十一、不合理的服装
    旧戏曲的服装，由于缺乏导演工作，一般没有精确设计服装的制度，因此往往扮的很不合理。戏演的是秦、汉、唐、宋、明的故事，而常有穿着满清服装的人物出场。本来把中国历史上的服装的变化，要在舞台上十分具体准确的区别清楚，是很困难的；但是，目前总是可以作到大体的区分。据说把衙役、禁卒、解差、老鸨、捞毛、以至盲人、医生等扮成清装，是为了对这类人表示轻蔑；即使如此，现在也应该加以根本改变了。因为现在这样表现已经是完全没有意义，只是一种不必要也不应该有的侮辱而已；而且在当时对于这些人的轻蔑，也显然是封建统治阶级的看法。退一步说，这类人即使不好，难道比吃人的反动统治者还不好么！况且其中有的如盲人是一种不幸的生理的残废，现在假如还从扮相上保留着这种轻蔑的意义，那就是绝大的侮辱和伤害了。
        第十二、检场
    这是中国戏曲的舞台作风多年存在的落后的现象。舞台上表演的是历史故事、古代人物，而让现代的人物，或青衣小帽，或光头短褂，或着干部制服，在台上出现，显得一台之上，古今杂乱，不仅破坏了剧情，也严重地伤害了艺术形式的完整。因此，我认为为了舞台形象的干净与完美，舞台作风的正规与严肃，检场人员是必须隐蔽的。现在有好多新编的戏，已经完全这样作了。旧戏避免检场人出场，也并不十分困难。检场人在台上不外两个主要的工作，一为安排桌椅；一为帮助演员当场换装、卸头面。这些工作，改变一下，并不是多么困难的事。剧中人跪拜时，必须飞过一个垫子，也实在是不合情理；据我推测，大概当年在农村演戏的时候，台面是土的或是木板的，跪下来容易把衣服弄脏，因此凡是跪拜、摔跌，总是要铺垫一下才好，这是完全有理由的；而今天在剧场中演戏，台上铺着地毡，也必须飞垫子，就完全是不必要的了。
    我这样说，并不是不要检场的人和检场的工作，只是要求把这一工作放在幕后。检场的工作，是舞台工作的一部分，是后台的工作，不应该让观众看见才对。只要多动脑筋，困难是完全可以克服的。
    关于戏曲舞台上隐蔽检场工作的问题，我们已经酝酿了好多年了，也曾经作了一些尝试，应该说还是有了成功的经验。过去有人说检场不出场“戏无法演”或者“观众会不接受”等等说法，现在通过事实，已经给予有力的说服了。开戏之后，除了剧中人外，任何人都不要在台上出头露面，跑来跑去。乐队也想办法隐蔽起来，这样才会使得舞台面干净、合理、完美。
            第十三、走尸
    在旧戏表演中，常常见到人死了以后又活了。角色死后，以演员的身份爬起来下场。“阳平关”中的焦炳、慕容烈被赵云抢挑身亡之后，竟然表演“回阳”下场。听说某城市还有这样的一个笑话：一个壮士把一个赃官杀死之后，就命令他：“尸首退下！”于是这具尸首就乖乖地站了起来向观众作个鬼脸，依命退下了。这就是所谓走尸。这种表演的不合理，是不待说的。不要以为观众习惯了“见怪不怪”了，而就故步自封不加改革。
            第十四、饮场
    饮场自然有它的理由：是为了保护嗓音。但是每场戏的唱工总不会太多，下场后再喝水是否可以呢？我以为是完全可以的。“三堂会审”一场，旦角的唱工是很繁重的，我们有好多位演员同志作过试验，不喝水完全可以，这也只是一个习惯的问题。无疑的，饮场也是破坏剧情的。总之，饮场和检场，同样有间断剧情和使舞台紊乱的不良效果，是应该坚决避免的。
        第十五、把场
    把场，原来是师父对弟子的一种演出的监督，一种对戏剧负责的表现。本来把场的人是在后台，一般的是在上场门的里面，来扶持照顾演员的演出。现在改称为“舞台监督”就更为名符其实；但是现在有的把场人竟在舞台上出头露面了，有的甚至站在前台，顾盼自雄，广告上扩大宣传：某某人亲自把场，这是不好的，这比检场的人出场，更不合理。
            第十六、抓哏逗笑
    演员抓哏，也是不好的现象。其结果，不是歪曲历史，就是污蔑现实。有人饰演王婆，当她给潘金莲与西门庆勾搭的时候，她这样介绍：“这是西门庆同志”，“这位是潘同志”。再如崇公道说：“我是某人的干爸爸”之类，实在无聊！更糟的是有的人演“溪皇庄”，旦角互相轻薄，这样说：“你别小看她！她是经外国人打过戳子的！”这是什么意思呢？难道受了帝国主义的侮辱，还认为是光荣的恩赐么！这样自轻自贱的态度，是不能容许的。今天的社会完全变了，观众也完全变了，他们要求艺术中处处表现爱国主义。我们艺人在旧社会受着帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义三座大山的压迫，压得翻不得身，抬不起头来，甚至有的人不得不迎合反动阶级的低级趣味。但是今天是人民解放的时代，艺人已经翻身，受到人民的喜爱和尊重了。因此，就必须抬起头来，自重自爱；然而，有些人直到今天，还在自轻自贱，甚至还在台上把自己比作王八，把自己骂得狗屁不值，目的在博得少数落后观众一笑，这是不能容许的。我认为无原则的抓哏逗笑低级取闹的基本原因，是艺人在政治上不学习的结果，是应该很快改变的。
            第十七、恶俗的噱头
    有些剧团不恰当地安排布景和道具，以“真蛇上台”、“真牛上台”等等炫奇斗胜，这种作风是不好的。李万春剧团今年演出的“天河配”，除了“真井真水、空盆出火、满台莲花、满台喜鹊、织女游泳、西瓜堆字、真鸟上台、真牛上台……”之外还有什么“实地背景”加映电影，可以说是最典型的例子。记得北京去年有一剧团演出“天河配”，也是“真牛上台”，牛郎在里面唱完了倒板，出场时牛不出来，几个检场人推着牛屁股推将出来，牛郎出场唱了半截“娃娃调”，又被牛拖了回去，于是检场人又使力地推了出来，牛在台上惊慌失措，焦躁不安，终于屙了一堆粪，检场人连忙拿出簸箕扫帚大扫其粪！台上尴尬不堪，台下哄堂大笑！下场时牛又不下场，还是几个检场人使力地推了进去。试问，如此“真牛上台”是有助于戏剧的表演呢，还是破坏了戏剧的表演呢？是不是真如有人所说的“山光水色之中，真牛出现，美丽之极，写意的很呢！”京剧表演一般的是借助于实物，如写字用笔，饮酒用杯，摇船用桨，杀人用刀，但是，所有这些，与真实的东西之间，不是已经有了很大的差异么！这就是把真实的东西根据舞台的条件和需要，加以艺术的夸张或者说是美化了。有的舞台上不可能表现的，绝不勉强表现。比如“武松打虎”假如也来个“真虎上台”，那么我很耽心会演出“虎吃武松”。再如京剧表演骑马，只是用一根马鞭，运用舞蹈表现骑姿，决不用“真马上台”，如果有人一定要用“真马上台”，那就变成马戏团了。比如一个元帅八员大将一同上马，请问，这个台子如何能够放得开呢！布景道具用的恰当，无疑的它是有助于戏剧的表演，用的不恰当，则对于艺术往往给以严重的伤害！所以我认为“真牛上台”“加演电影”之类的安排，与“纺棉花”中装设电灯的镍镀纺车之类，是同样恶俗的噱头，绝不是艺术。使得舞台上七乱八糟，破坏剧情，损伤艺术，是一种倒退的倾向，不是正确的道路，是应该予以纠正的。
    旧戏曲的表演方法、态度、作风，也就是舞台形象在落后方面所存在的各种野蛮的、恐怖的、猥亵的、奴化的、庸俗的表现，概如上述。所有这些，在政治上是侮辱自己的民族，伤害我们中国人民的自尊心的；在艺术上，则使得中国具有优秀传统的戏曲艺术蒙受了灰尘。戏曲改革工作，固然着重改进的是思想内容，但是，如果不把脸上的肮脏的灰尘洗擦干净，想使中国戏曲面貌达于健康完美的境界，是绝不可能的！
    因此，每一位具有爱国主义思想的戏剧工作者，都应是责无旁贷的，毫不犹豫地把澄清舞台形象的工作，提到爱国主义的原则来认识和实践，我想，订立爱国公约，这应是重要的内容之一。
    自然，澄清舞台形象，也是极其严肃细致的工作，要照科学的态度具体分析，绝不可潦草和鲁莽。目前所存在的落后的舞台形象，在处理上大体可分两类：一为毫无保留的革除的，已如上述；一为必须经过科学分析分别扬弃的，如删除酷刑现象，是指刑之酷者，如铡得身首异处，打得血肉横飞，以及炮烙、油锅、虿盆、剥皮、刀劈面门、钉入头顶、开膛剜心、剖腹验花之类。并非要在舞台上根绝用刑，问题在于避免凶残恐怖的影响，而又达到戏剧应有的效果。也就是说看是否用的确切恰当。脸谱的改进，也是去芜存菁，不是不分青红皂白，一律废除；磕头，也是尽量减少，不是在舞台之上全不跪拜；辫子，是民族压迫的耻辱的记号，不必去百般炫耀，但，决不是说吴三桂、曾国藩之流，也不要留辫子，石达开、韦昌辉等在金田村起义之前就蓄起发来了。至于武工、服装、彩头的改进，则更应保留与发展其基本优秀的成就，修改或废除其落后、丑恶的部分。上面谈的第一类最需要坚决改，第二类则需要细心改，犹豫动摇粗心大意对于一切工作都是错误的态度，戏曲改革工作自然不会例外，偶一不慎，都会产生恶果！
    以上情况，两年来，由于进行戏曲改革工作，已经有了很多的改变，并已开始创造出若干值得重视的新的健康美丽的形象。但是，不少的病态、丑恶、歪曲的舞台形象，还在某些舞台上某种程度地存在着，甚至严重地存在着，也还是不可忽视的事实。
    我们戏曲界就不仅需要为戏曲思想内容的健康、美丽和正确而奋斗，而且必须同时为舞台形象的健康、美丽和正确而奋斗！
