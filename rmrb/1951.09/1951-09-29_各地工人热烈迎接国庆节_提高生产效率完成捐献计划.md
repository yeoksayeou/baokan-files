Workers Across the Country Enthusiastically Welcome National Day
Increase Production Efficiency and Complete Donation Plans

    Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory
    Advance Completion of the "Yaohua Workers" Airplane Donation

    The workers of Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory completed their donation of the "Yaohua Workers" airplane two and a half months ahead of schedule, in celebration of National Day. As a result, they received praise from the city's branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association.

    In order to complete this task, all factory employees launched a movement to improve technology and increase production. Worker Wang Fulong from the repair shop responded to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and successfully modified the "cage mill," estimating that it would save 144 workdays per year. He continued to research and soon had new improvements, which could save another 96 workdays per year. Li Changling, a lathe operator in the same shop, adopted the Soviet high-speed cutting method, increasing the speed of machining railway car wheel tires by six times. Zhao Zengxiang, a brick maker in the refractory materials shop, adopted the advanced production method of the Soviet Guo Walyov, increasing the number of bricks produced from 600 to 1,100 per day. The employees of the glass workshop decided to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule to welcome National Day and increase the strength of Resist America, Aid Korea. As of September 23, the workshop had completed 98.4% of the plan and is expected to complete this year's annual task on September 28. (Shi Xiangrong)

    Zhejiang Xiaoshan Railway Parts Factory
        Constantly Creating New Records

    Since the launch of the patriotic red flag competition at the Zhejiang Xiaoshan Railway Parts Factory, many new records have been created based on the improvement of labor organization and operating methods. The factory employees also launched a gift-giving movement to celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    In the axle and wheel workshop, the electric welding team used to spend six hours welding a wheel hole. After adjusting the labor organization (originally two people worked together to weld one electric welding head, now changed to one person welding one, and reducing miscellaneous tasks such as hammering iron wire), Chen Runze first created a new record of four hours and thirty minutes. Yang Baojin (a member of the Communist Youth League) and Dong Weiliang continued to shorten it to four hours and five minutes. Soon, Yang Baojin created the highest record of two hours and fifty minutes.

    In order to greet National Day with practical actions, the factory's trade union called on all teams to launch a gift-giving movement. The fitter third team of the mechanical workshop was the first to respond to the call of the trade union. After a heated discussion, they proposed to over fulfill the production of ten sets of C-type brake cylinders as a gift for National Day. The team also challenged all other teams in the factory. The axle and wheel workshop immediately responded to the challenge, proposing to guarantee to exceed the highest historical record and produce 30 more pairs of wheels, and to ensure the quality reaches 99%. The sand casting workshop, the repair shop machine repair team, the boiler team, and the electrical team also put forward specific conditions for the challenge. Now a wave of gift-giving has been launched throughout the factory, and quick reports of challenges and responses are spreading everywhere. The workers are welcoming National Day with enthusiastic and intense emotions.

    National Datong Coal Mine Ma Liu Hai Team
        Overfulfills Production Plan

    The multi-hole rapid tunneling team led by Ma Liuhai, a national labor model from the state-owned Datong Coal Mine, is creating greater production achievements and completing the team's increased production and donation plan ahead of schedule to welcome the great National Day of the motherland. After concrete discussions and research, all team members re-revised the team's patriotic pact and signed a collective contract with the administration. After the team members revised the patriotic pact in August, their enthusiasm for labor became even higher. All team members unanimously proposed: To guarantee the creation of a new record of 350 meters per month, and strive for 400 meters, as a gift to celebrate National Day. The team decided to complete the 3.25 million yuan donation plan ahead of schedule in September and strive to over fulfill the production task. In the thirty-one working days from mid-August to early September, the team of twelve (after Ma Liuhai went to the Qingdao Sanatorium in the second half of the month, leaving eleven) tunneled a total of 479 meters and 88 centimeters in a roadway three meters wide and two meters high, for a total of 317 workdays, with an average progress of one meter, 51 centimeters, and 4 per workday, exceeding the quota by 116.29 percent.

    Datong Machinery Factory Workers Increase Production
        Efficiency

    All employees of the Chahar Provincial Datong Machinery Factory enthusiastically launched a labor competition to welcome National Day, and have continuously created new records. The fitter department made iron cotters (necessary when assembling walking plows). Initially, the most they could make per workday was 120. After the department foreman Li Sheng and workers Ge Changcai and Chi Fengshan worked hard to research and create a cotter-making machine, the output per workday increased to 1,774, increasing efficiency by 14 times. In the past, the ironwork department could only make 150 V-shaped screws per furnace per day. After foreman Wang Xiangjin created a machine for manufacturing this type of product, 1,800 pieces could be completed per day, increasing efficiency by 11 times. Other examples include the casting department making walking plowshares. In the past, the scrap rate per workday was 50 percent. After Jiang Yuxiang and two others improved the technology, the quality of finished products increased to 95 percent. (Research Office of the CPC Datong Municipal Committee)

    Tangshan Many Factory and Mine Workers Guarantee
        To Overfulfill the September Production Task

    In order to celebrate the second anniversary of National Day, many factory and mine workers in Tangshan have set conditions to ensure that practical actions are taken as gifts for National Day. In addition to guaranteeing the completion of the September production task on schedule, the workers of the Tangshan Railway Factory will produce one locomotive and one passenger car, and eleven freight cars before September 30 as gifts for National Day. The Tangshan Power Plant is developing a movement to exploit potential capacity, based on a new record of 414 days of safe power generation. In order to commemorate the great National Day, they decided to officially compete with the Qingdao Power Plant to reduce coal consumption from zero o'clock on October 1. The 325 teams of Huaxin Yarn Factory guaranteed to conduct a comprehensive inspection and revision of the patriotic pact before National Day. They also planned to expand and promote the Hao Jianxiu work method to welcome National Day. In addition, workers at Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory, Desheng Porcelain Factory, and Zhongshan Factory are all exceeding the September production quota to welcome National Day.
