How the People's Congresses of Yushe and Yangqu Counties, Shanxi, Handle Proposals

Zheng Xiuying

The Yushe County People's Congress collects proposals before the meeting and, to facilitate processing, issues proposal forms to ensure that each proposal is addressed. The method is as follows: the Standing Committee, together with relevant government departments, forms a proposal sorting group to classify and study the proposals in advance and put forward preliminary opinions. During the People's Congress, a proposal review committee (generally including the original sorters) is formally established to conduct reviews, and then submitted to the presidium for research and decision. Important issues are submitted to the general assembly for discussion; general inquiries are answered by the general assembly; general suggestions are transferred to relevant government departments for handling or reference; those that cannot be handled or need to be postponed are explained at the meeting. From the sixth People's Congress onwards, proposal forms were printed and distributed (divided into two columns: one for the reasons for the proposal and the proposed handling opinions, and the other for the general assembly's answers or the implementation status after handling, to be returned to the original proposer). In this way, each proposal is addressed and resolved, making the people's representatives feel satisfied. Proposals have been increasing day by day. For example, a total of 539 proposals were received from the first to the sixth meetings, 215 at the sixth meeting, and 363 at the seventh meeting.

The Yangqu County People's Congress organizes forces to earnestly implement the proposals after they are passed. They have also established specific methods and systems for the handling and inspection of proposals: (1) Since the second People's Congress, a system has been established where the county People's Government reports on the handling of proposals from the previous meeting at each meeting (distributed to representatives of each district for circulation). (2) The government convenes meetings of relevant departments every month and invites representatives to participate to inspect the implementation of proposal handling by each department. (3) After the fifth meeting, the county's leading comrades more clearly realized that earnestly handling proposals is one of the keys to holding a successful People's Congress, and formulated the "Yangqu County People's Government's Measures for Handling Proposals from People's Representatives of All Circles." It stipulates various specific methods for handling proposals. Representative symposiums are also held in districts, where district offices report on the handling of proposals in their districts and solicit representatives' opinions on the handling of proposals. As a result of this, the masses felt very satisfied, and the representatives said: "The county and district attach importance to it, and the problem is easy to solve." At the fifth People's Congress, a representative from Lijia Gou in the Sixth District proposed that six children had died in his village due to an epidemic in four days. The representative from Foutangping Village reflected that the primary school teacher Wang Yueliang had a bad style and was incompetent. The People's Government accepted the representatives' opinions and immediately sent a doctor to Lijia Gou overnight; at the general assembly on the fourth day, it was announced that Wang Yueliang would be dismissed. As a result, the representatives and the masses felt that "speaking works," "the representative meeting solves problems," and "the government is truly serving the people wholeheartedly." It inspired the representatives' sense of ownership and established the representatives' prestige among the masses. Before each meeting, the masses entrust their proposals to the representatives; the representatives also try their best to collect proposals from the masses. As a result, a total of 1394 proposals were received at the sixth meeting (of which 751 were answered, 532 were handled, and 111 could not be handled). This approach effectively educated cadres, improved work, and strengthened the ties between the people and the government.

    山西榆社、阳曲两县人民代表会议是怎样处理提案的？
    郑秀英
    榆社县人民代表会议在会前搜集提案，并为了便于处理起见，制发提案纸，作到案案有交代。其办法是：由常委会会同政府有关部门，组成提案整理组，事先加以分类研究，提出初步意见。开代表会时，再正式产生提案审查委员会（一般吸收原整理人参加）进行审查，然后交主席团研究决定。凡重要的问题即交大会讨论；一般询问事项由大会解答；一般建议事项转政府有关部门办理或参考；不能办或需缓办者则在会上加以解释。第六次代表会起，印发了提案纸（分两栏：一是提案理由及处理意见，一是大会对提案的解答内容或处理后执行情况，退回原提案人）。这样，提案件件有交代，有着落，使群众代表均感到满意。提案就日益增多起来。如第一至第六次会议共收到提案五三九件，第六次会议为二一五件，第七次时增至三六三件。
    阳曲县人民代表会议于提案通过后，组织力量认真贯彻执行。他们对提案的处理检查还定出了具体办法与制度：（一）从第二次人民代表会议起，建立了在每次会上由县人民政府报告对上次会议提案的处理情况（印发每区代表传阅）的制度。（二）政府每月召集有关部门开会并请代表参加，检查各部门对提案处理的执行情况。（三）第五次会议之后，县领导同志更明确认识到认真处理提案是开好人民代表会议的关键之一，制定了“阳曲县人民政府关于各界人民代表会议提案处理办法”。规定出处理提案的各项具体办法。并分区召开代表座谈会，由区公所报告本区提案处理情况，征求代表对提案处理的意见。这样作的结果，使群众感到很满意，代表们说：“县、区都重视，问题好解决了。”第五次人民代表会议上六区李家沟代表提出，该村在四天中因流行病死了小孩六个；佛堂平村代表反映了该村小学教员王月亮作风不好，不称职。人民政府接受了代表的意见，立即派医生星夜赶赴李家沟；在第四天大会上宣布将王月亮撤职。这样做的结果，代表和群众都感到“说话顶事”，“代表会解决问题”，“政府真是全心全意为人民办事”。启发了代表的主人翁思想，树立了代表在群众中的威信。每次会议前，群众都把自己的提案交付代表；代表也尽量向群众搜集提案。结果在第六次会议时共收到提案一三九四件（其中解答的七五一件，已办的五三二件，不能办的一一一件）。这一作法有力地教育了干部，改进了工作，密切了人民与政府的联系。
