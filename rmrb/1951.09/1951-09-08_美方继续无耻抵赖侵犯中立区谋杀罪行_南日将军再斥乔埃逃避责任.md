Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 6th: General Nam Il's reply to Joy's letter of September 4th regarding the continuous murder of our military police is as follows:

To Vice Admiral Joy, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Your letter of September 4th regarding the incidents of your South Korean troops continuously murdering our military police on August 19th and August 30th has been received. No amount of fact-denying tactics can absolve your side of the serious responsibility for the above two incidents. Our side has ample human and material evidence to prove your inescapable responsibility. Your letter once again confirms that your side has no intention of dealing with the aforementioned serious incidents in a serious and responsible manner, and therefore it is absolutely unsatisfactory.

	General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 6th: General Nam Il's reply to Joy's letter of September 4th is as follows:

To Vice Admiral Joy, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Your letter of September 4th regarding the continuous intrusion of your military aircraft into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, and the dropping of flares over the Neutral Zone on August 29th, has been received. Your side's serious responsibility for the above-mentioned incidents cannot be absolved by your letter denying everything regardless of the facts. Furthermore, you must bear the serious responsibility for your military aircraft continuing to intrude wantonly into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone after August 29th up to the present day. Your letter is absolutely unsatisfactory.
