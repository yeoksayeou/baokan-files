Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 3rd: TASS reports: The United States, Australia, and New Zealand signed the so-called "Tripartite Security Treaty" in San Francisco on September 1st. This tripartite military agreement was announced in July. Foreign newspapers at the time pointed out that this agreement was a "mini-Pacific Pact," the purpose of which was to establish a Far East aggressive bloc similar to the North Atlantic Group.

    The American ruling clique attempts to portray the above-mentioned tripartite treaty as a guarantee of the security of these countries, and to ease the dissatisfaction of the Australian and New Zealand people with American policies, which aim to restore Japanese militarism as the main attacking force of the United States in the Far East. In fact, not only does this treaty not provide any guarantee to those countries that they will no longer be threatened by Japanese aggression, it does not even mention such a threat. This is because the United States wants to sign a military agreement with Japanese reactionaries to supplement this treaty. The United States plans to assign the task of the core of the Pacific Group to Japan through this military agreement.

    The above-mentioned treaty is actually to link Australia and New Zealand more closely with the United States' aggressive policy in Asia. This is confirmed by the special provisions of the treaty, which stipulate that these countries have the obligation to intensify the movement to expand armaments. Another task of this treaty is to further separate Australia and New Zealand, the largest dominions of Great Britain in the Far East, from the British Empire.

    美澳新签订侵略军事协定
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社纽约三日讯：美国、澳大利亚和新西兰九月一日在旧金山签订了所谓“三国安全条约”。这个三国军事协定是在七月间公布的。当时的外国报纸已经指出这个协定是“小太平洋公约”，其目的是为了成立和北大西洋集团相类似的远东侵略集团。
    美国统治集团企图把上述的三国条约说成是这些国家安全的保障，企图缓和澳大利亚和新西兰人民大众不满美国政策，这种政策的目的是要恢复日本军国主义作为美国在远东的主要攻击力量。事实上，这个条约中不仅没有使那些国家获得不再受日本侵略威胁的任何保证，甚至根本没有提到这种威胁。这是因为美国想和日本反动派签订一个军事协定来补充这个条约，美国计划通过这个军事协定，把太平洋集团核心的任务派给日本。
    上述条约实际上是为了使澳大利亚和新西兰与美国的亚洲侵略政策联系得更紧密些。这一点可从这个条约的特别条款中得到证实，这一条款规定这些国家有加紧进行扩张军备运动的义务。这个条约的另一个任务是使英国在远东最大的自治领——澳大利亚和新西兰，和大英帝国分离得更远。
