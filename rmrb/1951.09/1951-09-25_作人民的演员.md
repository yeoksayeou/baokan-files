To Be an Actor of the People
Xin Fengxia

The People's Republic of China has been established for two years. Celebrating this second National Day in Beijing is the most exciting and joyous thing. But to speak of my feelings about this festival, I cannot help but recall the bitterness of my life over the past twenty years. Because if I had not been able to endure any of the past hardships, I would not have the happiness of today.

I grew up in Tianjin. My cousin was a female warrior in Peking Opera. Her parents died early, and she grew up with my parents, so she was like my own sister. I loved singing opera since I was a child, so I practiced with my sister from the age of eight; but my father always opposed it, saying, "If my sister sings opera, our whole family will lose face with her. Every day we are worried. When she goes to the theater to perform, we are anxious at home!" My sister would say, "My father is old, and my younger siblings are still young. If I get married, what will happen to this family?"

My father had always opposed me learning opera. I went to school until I was fourteen, and when my sister got married and went to the south, the family's life became difficult. I then formally learned Ping opera. I had loved drama since I was a child, but I really started learning opera from that time. For the sake of the family's life, my father no longer opposed it. In the past, we in the opera business were all doing it for a living.

I was truly happy that I could learn opera. Relying on the foundation I had built since I was eight years old, I started performing on stage at the age of fifteen. Once I actually started performing, I understood why my father had opposed it. What I encountered and suffered was completely different from what I had imagined in my heart when I was learning opera. Starting to perform meant starting a hard life, a truly difficult life!

From then on, I bore the burden of supporting the family. In order to eat, I had to go to the theater to perform. Every day was like passing through the gates of hell: local gangsters, crooked-hatted officials and special agents, came to the backstage in unknown numbers every day. They would lie down on their backs in the dressing room. Sometimes they would get drunk and vomit all over the room, even on the costumes. I was so angry that I wanted to die, but I still had to smile and say, "It's okay." After they left, I would cry and curse, but I didn't dare to be loud. These were all very ordinary things.

Because the cost of living in Tianjin was too high, and the money I earned was not enough to eat, I went to Qingdao to perform for the first time. When I set off, I didn't dare to get on the train with my baggage carrier and supporting actors, fearing that the railway police would cause trouble. In the end, I couldn't avoid it. After the train started, the baggage carrier came to find me from another carriage. I saw my costumes thrown all over the train, and the enemy and puppet police beat my mother. As soon as they saw me, they told me to sing on the train, to stand and sing "Widow Ma Opens a Shop." I cried at the time, but I had to sing even while crying, and it only ended when they were satisfied. I thought to myself that people who sang opera were miserable, and I would never dare to go out again. In Qingdao, I suffered even greater insults and more anger from the traitors and running dogs, but I was even more afraid of the station and the train, and I didn't dare to return to Tianjin.

After Japan surrendered, American soldiers came to Qingdao. They made even more trouble, watching plays without buying tickets and beating people at will. It was impossible to perform anymore, and my whole family relied on selling costumes to survive. Finally, my mother, my sister, and I took a boat back to Tianjin. Unexpectedly, things were still the same in Tianjin. I really couldn't understand why I was still suffering after the victory? Before the liberation of Tianjin, seven or eight Kuomintang people forcibly moved into my house, occupying four rooms. They came back in the middle of the night every day, and my family didn't dare to close the gate. If we closed it, they would beat and scold people, beating my sixty-year-old father so that he didn't dare to come out of the house. They would defecate and urinate in the house; they ate all the rice in my house and burned all the firewood. My sister and I both hid in relatives' homes. They only left when liberation was imminent.

The day after the liberation of Tianjin, my mother picked me up and brought me home. On Nanma Road, I saw many People's Liberation Army soldiers. My mother said, "Let's walk with our heads down, be careful they get angry and beat people!" At this time, three PLA soldiers came up from behind and said to my mother, "Old woman, I'll hold the child for you, you come with us, there are mines buried by the enemy on the road that have not been completely dug up yet." When we heard these words, we couldn't even speak. The PLA soldiers supported my mother all the way and sent us home. We were so grateful that we wanted to cry.

My mother said, "Times have changed!"

After liberation, the theaters in Tangshan came to pick me up to perform, and I had to get on the train again. My mother asked the person who came to pick us up, "Should we still get on the train separately?" The person said, "It's okay to get on the train together, it's not like it used to be." We had never seen such a peaceful train before, and we also saw the new society on the train.

On the train, I heard people call us a new name for the first time: "Literary and Art Workers."

The Tangshan Cultural and Art Department helped us a lot. They also invited me to participate in the first Congress of Literary and Art Workers in Tangshan. I didn't dare to go. Although I went later, I was always afraid in my heart, feeling that I was not qualified. When they asked me to speak, I didn't dare to speak; I sat in my seat and didn't dare to move. I was both happy and surprised.

In 1949, my whole family moved to Beijing, and people invited me to perform at the Wanshengxuan Theater in Tianqiao. I was worried that if I performed in Tianqiao, it would be difficult to perform in the city. Later I learned that today's Tianqiao is truly a place where the working people are concentrated; the attendance is good, and the order is also good. With the cultivation and help of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and various aspects, we performed many new plays, such as "Liu Qiao Sues," "Nine Pieces of Clothing," "The White-Haired Girl," "Xiao Erhei Gets Married," and "Hatred as Deep as the Sea," which the audience all liked very much. In the past, most Ping operas were mostly erotic. We slowly replaced the backward old operas with healthy new operas. We retained and promoted the healthy parts of the old operas.

Since October of last year, under the leadership of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, we changed our original "Fengming Troupe" to the "Capital Experimental Ping Opera Troupe" and moved to a theater in the city to perform. The Cultural and Art Department led us to cooperate with new literary and art workers to stage "The Little Son-in-Law," which promoted the new Marriage Law. In order to cooperate with the political task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, we used our own experiences as content and compiled and performed "Deep Hatred in the Sea of Art," and the new "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," which were all warmly welcomed by the audience. We often performed new plays in factory areas, and for the sake of resisting America and aiding Korea, we held a charity performance every week.

I have infinite gratitude and infinite love for the new society. I deeply felt the loveliness of my motherland and people. I participated in the Beijing Municipal Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the National Opera Conference, and the first Beijing Municipal Congress of Youth Representatives. I am striving to be a glorious member of the Communist Youth League and a glorious member of the Communist Party in the future. I am no longer shy and no longer afraid. I spoke at the meetings, expressing my feelings and hopes.

I hope that I can improve my political thought and cultural level. Because of the low level of political thought and culture, our progress in business and art is limited. My comrades in our troupe and I have been performing for two and a half years without rest since liberation; due to excessive physical fatigue, we lack sufficient time for study and observation. But we are still trying our best to learn. At the Opera Conference, Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the Central Committee, introduced me to Premier Zhou, who said, "Comrade, you are Xiao Qin, you must study hard." I am studying hard. Thinking that in the old society we were afraid to see people, and we didn't dare to say a word wherever we went; we were also afraid of our colleagues in the opera world. Only when we got home after the show every day, and closed the door, did we dare to take a breath. Compared with today, we have certainly made progress. But because of the low level of culture and thought, I feel that there are still many things in me that have not been liberated; there are still concerns, and there are still backward thoughts left over from the old society. I have to study harder to make further progress.

I struggled hard from the darkness and suffering. If there were no Communist Party, no Chairman Mao, I would not have today. We are celebrating the second anniversary of the National Day. I have also been performing in Beijing for two years. Today I have a good life and a good future, and my gratitude is endless. I hope that the audience who have cared for us for the past two years will give us more guidance, and that our wise leaders and comrades in the literary and art circles will help us and cultivate us better. I guarantee that I will learn with an open mind and study my profession diligently, so that I can unite more closely with the broad masses and make progress together, to be a true actor of the people.

专栏：庆祝建国两周年

    作人民的演员

    中华人民共和国成立两年了。在北京过这个第二届国庆节是叫人最兴奋最快活的事情。可是叫我说我对这节日的感想，就不能不使我又想起过去二十多年生活的酸苦。因为假如我没能熬过往时任何的一次苦难，我就得不到今天的幸福。
    我生长在天津。我的堂姐是唱京戏刀马旦的。她的父母早亡，跟着我爹我妈长大，所以跟我亲姐姐一样。我从小也爱唱戏，所以八岁就跟我姐练工；可是爸爸老是反对，说：“姐姐唱了戏，咱们一家子全都跟她丢人。每天提心吊胆，她上园子演戏，我们在家揪心！”姐姐就说：“爸爸年纪大了，弟弟妹妹都小，我要是结了婚，这一家可怎么办呢？”
    爸爸一直是反对我学戏的。我在学校念书到十四岁时候，姐姐结过婚到南方去了，家里生活没法子，我就正式学评戏。我是从小就喜爱戏剧的，但真正学戏还是从那时候开始。为了家里的生活，父亲不再反对。过去我们干戏这一行，都是为了生活。
    我真能学戏了，我是打心里高兴的。仗着我自从八岁练工的根底，我十五岁就登台唱戏。这一真唱戏，我才明白父亲为什么反对唱戏了，所遇到的和受到的和我学戏的时候心中想的完全不同了。开始唱戏，就开始了苦日子，真难过的苦日子呀！
    从此我负担了一家的生活，为了要吃饭，不能不上园子唱戏。每天就好像过鬼门关一样：地痞流氓，歪带帽子的官面特务，每天后台不知来多少。他们到扮戏的屋里就仰面朝天一躺。有时候喝醉了吐的满屋子都是，行头上也吐满了，我气得要死，可是还得陪笑说：“没关系。”他们走了我就哭起来骂起来，可又不敢大声。这都是最平常的事情。
    因为天津的生活水平太高，挣的钱不够吃的，我第一次出门到青岛去唱戏。动身的时候，我不敢和我的跟包的和帮角的一起上车，怕的是车上的警务段找麻烦，结果可还是躲不了，车开以后，跟包的从另外一节车上找我来了。我看见我的行头扔得满车都是，敌伪的警察把我娘也打了。他们一见着我，就叫我在车上唱，叫我站着唱“马寡妇开店”。当时我就哭了，哭了也要唱，唱到他们满意了才算完。我心里想唱戏的人是苦到家了，往后再也不敢出门了。在青岛受的是汉奸走狗们的更大的侮辱，更多的气，可是更怕车站和火车上的这一关，也不敢回天津。
    日本投降之后，青岛来了美国兵。闹得更凶，看戏不买票，见人就打，实在不能唱戏了，我们全家指着卖行头过日子。最后我跟我娘我妹妹坐船回到天津。不想到了天津仍是那样，我实在想不通，为什么胜利了还受气呢？天津解放之前，有七八个国民党人强住到我家里，占了四间房子。每天半夜三更回来，我家的大门不敢关上，关上他们就打人骂人，打得我六十岁的爹不敢出屋来。他们就在屋里大小便；把我家的米吃光，柴火烧光。我和我妹妹都躲到亲戚家去住。临到解放他们才走。
    天津解放第二天，我娘接我回来。在南马路上看见很多解放军，娘说：“咱们低着头走，留神他们生气打人！”这时后边走来三个解放军，对我娘说：“老大娘，我给您抱着孩子，您跟我们走，这路上有敌人临走埋的地雷还没有挖尽呢。”我们听了这话，连话也说不出来了。解放军一直搀着我娘，送我们到家，我们感激得要哭出来。
    我娘说：“这年月可变了！”
    解放以后，唐山的园子来接我唱戏，又得上火车。我娘问来接我们的人说：“我们还是单上车吧？”人家说：“一起上车没关系，如今不像以前那样了。”我们都从没见过这么平安无事的火车，在火车上也看见了新社会。
    在火车上，我第一次听见人家叫我们一个新鲜的名字：“文艺工作者”。
    唐山的文艺处帮我们很多忙。又约我参加了唐山第一次的文艺工作者代表大会。我不敢去。后来虽然去了，但是一直心里害怕，觉得自己不够资格，要我讲话，我没敢讲；我坐在我的位子上不敢动，我是又喜又惊。
    一九四九年我全家搬到北京，人家约我在天桥万盛轩唱戏。我心里顾虑着在天桥唱了，就很难在街里唱了。后来我才知道今天的天桥真正是劳动人民集中的地方；上座好，秩序也好。在北京市文教局文艺处和各方面的培养帮助下，我们演出了很多新戏，像“刘巧告状”，“九件衣”，“白毛女”，“小二黑结婚”，“仇深似海”，观众都非常喜欢。过去的评戏大都是色情的居多，我们慢慢把健康的新戏代替了落后的旧戏，旧戏里的健康的部分我们保留并且发扬它。
    从去年十月，我们由市文艺处领导，把我们原来的“凤鸣剧社”改为“首都实验评剧团”，移到市内的剧场演出。文艺处领导我们和新文艺工作者合作，上演了宣传新婚姻法的“小女婿”，为了配合镇压反革命的政治任务，用我们自己的经历作内容，编演了“艺海深仇”，和新的“牛郎织女”，这些戏都得到观众热烈的欢迎。我们经常在工厂区演出新戏，为了抗美援朝，我们每星期举行一次捐献义演。
    对新社会我有无限的感激，无限的喜爱。我深深感到了我的祖国和人民的可爱。我参加了北京市文艺工作者代表大会，参加了全国戏曲工作会议，参加了北京市首届青年代表大会。我正在争取作一个光荣的青年团员，作未来的光荣的共产党员。我不再害羞也不再害怕了。我在会上都讲了话，说出了我的感想和希望。
    我希望我能提高我的政治思想和文化水平，由于政治思想和文化水平低，就限制了我们在业务上艺术上的进步。我和我们剧团的同志们自从解放以后已经作了两年半没有休息的演出；因为身体的过度疲劳，在学习和观摩方面都缺少充分的时间。可是我们仍是尽量争取学习的。在戏曲工作会议上，中央文化部沈雁冰部长介绍我见周总理，总理说：“同志，你就是小芹，你要好好地学习。”我是在好好学习的。想到在旧社会里我们见到人就害怕，到那儿也不敢多说一句话；就是对自己戏曲界的同行也是害怕的，只有每天散戏回家，关上房门时才敢喘一口大气。比起今天我们当然是进步了。可就是因为文化和思想水平低，我觉得自己身上还有很多没有解放的东西；还是有顾忌，还有旧社会留下的落后的思想。这都得更努力学习才能使我更进一步。
    我是从黑暗里苦难里苦苦挣扎过来的。假如没有共产党，没有毛主席，我就没有今天。我们庆祝国庆两周年。我来北京唱戏也是两周年。今天我有了美好的生活，有了美好的前途，我的感激是说不完的。我希望两年来爱护我们的观众更多地指教我们，我们的贤明的领导者及文艺界的同志们更好地帮助我们，培养我们。我保证我虚心学习，精研业务，让我和广大的群众更亲密地结合起来一同进步，作一个真正的人民的演员。
