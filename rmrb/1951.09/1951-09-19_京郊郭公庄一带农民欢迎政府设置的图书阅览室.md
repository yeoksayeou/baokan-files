To the Editorial Board:

The peasants, after achieving liberation, are in urgent need of cultural nourishment, and they are thirsting for new culture. From what I understand, they most enjoy reading literary works with new content. For example, the library in Fengtai Town, in the 12th District of suburban Beijing, used to be located in Fengtai Town, and many peasants would come from far away to borrow books and periodicals. To make it easier for the peasants to read, the government specifically moved the library to Guogongzhuang, which has been very well received by the peasants. Many peasants, even after a day's work, still run to the library to borrow literary books to read. Tai Ziyu Village in the district, because it is far from Fengtai Town, finds it inconvenient to borrow books, but the students in the village school all love literary books. Sometimes, when they can't borrow books, they read the Korean dispatches in the newspapers, which everyone finds very interesting and educational. In the reading group in Machang Village, an old lady, after listening to someone read Ma Feng's novel "Marriage," clapped her hands and said with a smile: "In the past, I was a 'bookworm,' and I couldn't move when I heard storytellers. Today, I realize that the storytellers of the past mostly told feudal superstitions, and some were even reactionary. A novel like 'Marriage' today is truly about our own peasant affairs, and I love listening to novels like this!" From these examples, we can see how much the peasants love new literature and art, and the fact proves that literary works are a powerful weapon for educating the peasants. Literary and artistic workers should create more works with patriotic content suitable for peasants to read, in order to educate the peasants.

Editor's Note: The two reader letters published above reflect the peasants' urgent need for cultural entertainment after achieving liberation. These demands illustrate the importance of popularizing literature and art and should be brought to the attention of literary and artistic workers and publishing and distribution organizations. The Beijing Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association has printed more than 150 types of new Quyi popular editions, totaling more than 800,000 copies, since the end of 1949. The content mainly features workers, peasants, and soldiers, including lyrics, fast-clapper tales, comic dialogues, and short plays. Each book costs more than one hundred yuan. They are sold by Xinhua Bookstore, local vendors, Beijing temple fairs, and Baowentang in Damo Factory in Beijing, and are available for workers and peasants to read and perform. Their approach is worth promoting.

### 京郊郭公庄一带农民欢迎政府设置的图书阅览室

专栏：读者来信

    京郊郭公庄一带农民欢迎政府设置的图书阅览室编辑同志：
    翻身后的农民迫切需要文化食粮，他们对于新文化是如饥如渴的。据我的了解，他们最喜欢读一些新内容的文艺作品。如京郊十二区丰台镇的阅览室，原在丰台镇上，许多农民都从很远的地方来这里借阅书刊。政府为了照顾农民阅读方便，特把阅览室迁移到郭公庄，很受农民们的欢迎。许多农民虽然干了一天活，还是跑到阅览室借文艺书看。该区太子峪村因离丰台镇远，借阅不太方便，但村民校的学员们都很喜欢文艺书，有时借不到书就读报纸上的朝鲜通讯，大家很感兴趣，也从中受到了教育。马厂村读报组里有一位老太太听别人读完马烽的小说“结婚”时，拍手笑着说：“过去我是‘书迷’，听见说书的就走不动道，今天我才知道过去的说唱多是封建迷信，有的是反动的。像今天的小说‘结婚’，才真正是咱农民自己的事儿呢，像这样的小说我才爱听哩！”从以上这些事例看来，农民是多么热爱新文艺，而且事实证明文艺作品是教育农民的有力武器。文艺工作者应多创作适合于农民阅读的爱国主义内容的作品，以教育农民。

    编者按：上面发表的两封读者来信，反映了翻身农民对于文化娱乐的迫切要求。这些要求说明文艺普及工作的重要，应引起文艺工作者和出版、发行机关的注意。北京大众文艺创作研究会自一九四九年底到现在，已印行了一百五十多种，八十多万册新曲艺普及本，内容以表现工农兵为主，其中有唱词、快板、相声、小戏等。每本一百多元。由新华书店、各地小贩、北京庙会、北京打磨厂宝文堂销行，可供工农阅读、演唱。他们的这种做法是值得提倡的。
