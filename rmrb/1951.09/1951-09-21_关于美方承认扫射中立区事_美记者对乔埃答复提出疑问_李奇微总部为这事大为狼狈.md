    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th. According to the New York "Daily Worker," the New York "Herald Tribune" published a dispatch from its Tokyo correspondent McConnell on the 13th. The dispatch questioned Joye's reply to General Nam Il regarding the US aircraft strafing the Kaesong neutral zone on September 10th, saying: "Joye's reply has raised questions here: Why was the fact that Allied aircraft flew over the neutral zone not reported to higher authorities for action? ... Once the radar identified the bomber pilot, was he warned to leave the Kaesong area? If the pilot received a warning that he was over Kaesong, or knew of the navigational error before strafing, why wasn't his report upon his return immediately given to the Fifth Air Force officers for action?"
    The questions raised by McConnell have greatly embarrassed the US side. According to a Dentsu News Agency dispatch from New York on the 18th, McConnell said on the 15th that he and CBS reporter Herman received a warning from Allen, the head of Ridgway's headquarters press office. Allen said, "Don't forget which side you're on."
    The New York "Daily Worker" pointed out in its editorial on the 13th that the "Herald Tribune" reporter provided clues to a conspiracy against peace in Korea. The "Daily Worker" said: "McConnell's report stated in plain English that the machine gun strafing could not have occurred without the active participation of unknown army personnel in the conspiracy." The newspaper said, "It is precisely because of this insidious situation that the ceasefire negotiations almost broke down."

    关于美方承认扫射中立区事
    美记者对乔埃答复提出疑问
    李奇微总部为这事大为狼狈
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】据纽约“工人日报”载纽约“先驱论坛报”十三日发表该报记者麦康奈尔的东京电讯，该电讯就乔埃承认美机九月十日扫射开城中立区致南日将军的答复提出疑问说：“乔埃的答复，在此间引起了这样的问题：为什么连盟国飞机飞临中立区的上空一事也不报告给高级当局以便采取行动？……在雷达一旦确定了轰炸机飞行员的身份后，有没有警告他离开开城地区？如果飞行员接到他已在开城上空的警告，或者在扫射之前已经知道犯了航行差错，那末他飞行回来后提出的汇报为什么不立刻交给第五航空队军官以便采取行动？”
    麦康奈尔所提出问题，已使美方大为狼狈。据电通社纽约十八日讯：麦康奈尔在十五日说，他和哥伦比亚广播公司的记者赫尔曼接到了李奇微总部新闻处处长艾伦的警告。艾伦说：“不要忘记你们是在那一方面。”
    纽约“工人日报”在十三日的社论中指出：“先驱论坛报”记者提供了反对朝鲜和平的阴谋的线索。“工人日报”说：“麦康奈尔的报道用普通的英语说明了：没有未知名的陆军人员积极地参与阴谋，就不可能发生机枪扫射的事件。”该报说：“正是由于这种阴险的事态，停火谈判才几乎遭到破坏。”
