Grammar and Rhetoric Talks (Lecture 4)
　　　　Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi

Third Section Predicate

The predicate and the subject are not properly matched. It is necessary that A is B to use the word "is". This seems like a pointless statement, but many sentences are wrong because they ignore this extremely simple principle. It is true that we have some idioms that conflict with this principle, such as "Who is the chairman of today's meeting?" A "meeting" cannot be a "chairman." "This case is Zhang San's plaintiff and Li Si's defendant." A "case" cannot be a "plaintiff" or a "defendant." But the reason why idioms are idioms is that they do not allow for analogy. The following sentences are all specious.

(1) Because we are a country led by the working class. (Book)
(2) Understanding that peasants and workers have the same pitiful fate. (Book)
(3) But in fact, the problem is only just beginning here. (Journal)
(4) I feel that this reply, and the investigation and handling of these problems, are a kind of irresponsible attitude. (Letter) (1) Should say "Our country is led by the working class." (2) Should say "The fate of peasants and workers is equally tragic" (Using "pitiful" to describe "fate" is not as good as using "tragic"). (3) Should say "This is only the beginning of the problem." (4) Should change "is" to "expresses." The following sentences are not even "specious."

(5) Obviously, the task facing translators is the question of how to improve the quality of translation work. (Journal)
(6) But this kind of reclamation and cultivation work is the labor of the peasants, neither the landlord's money nor the landlord's ruling power. (Newspaper)
(7) The People's Liberation Army's achievements in January of this year are the most brilliant month since the two-and-a-half-year Liberation War. (Journal) (5) "Task" cannot be a "question," one of the two must be removed. (If "question" is removed, "how" must also be cancelled, and the word "的" must be moved before "quality.") (6) "Work" cannot be "labor," "money," and "power," it should be said "What completes this kind of...work is..." (7) Should say "January of this year was the month with the most brilliant achievements in the two-and-a-half-year Liberation War." ("People's Liberation Army" can be omitted, the achievements of the Liberation War of course refer to the achievements of the People's Liberation Army; "since the two-and-a-half-year Liberation War" is also inappropriate.)
(8) All Shanghai citizens are tightly grasped by two emotions, one is painful memories, and the other is angry shouts. (Journal)
(9) The creation, invention, and improvement of these machines and tools have all been doubled, several times, or even dozens or hundreds of times for the improvement of production efficiency. (Journal)
(10) Such repeated courses certainly increase the burden on the students, and are a great contradiction to the health problems of young people. (Journal)
(11) Any government, when it begins to oppose the progressive forces in the country, is also the signal for its own collapse. (Journal) (8) "Memories" and "shouts" cannot be called "emotions," and there is no other word to summarize these two behaviors. This sentence can only be changed to "All Shanghai citizens, on the one hand, evoke painful memories, and on the other hand, issue angry roars" ("Shouts" is inappropriate). (9) The incoherence is very obvious, and it is very easy to change: "...increased production efficiency by one time, several times...". I don't understand why the author didn't adopt such a clear and straightforward statement, and had to twist and turn so much. ("Creation" and "invention" are the same thing, one is enough; "数" and "几" are used randomly, and there is no reason for it, "几" should be used uniformly.) (10) Neither "courses" nor the entire first clause can be a "contradiction," nor can they contradict "problems." It can only be said "is in contradiction with the policy of paying attention to the health of young people." ("Increased the burden on the students" should also be changed to "...a lot of burden" or "greatly increase...") (11) "Government" cannot be a "signal." This sentence should delete "when it" and "when," and change "也正是" to "那就是". Finally, there are two examples that can illustrate that improper matching of predicate and subject can produce meanings that are different or even contrary to the original meaning.

(12) But in this negotiation, I personally experienced that the rumors of imperialism and the Kuomintang are completely not facts. (Newspaper)
(13) The work itself is a great excitement and confidence for us. (Journal) (12) Saying that "the rumors of imperialism and the Kuomintang" are not "facts" is equivalent to saying that they did not spread rumors. Is this really what the author meant? Should say "The words of imperialism and the Kuomintang are all rumors, completely not facts." (13) Saying that "this work" is "a great excitement and confidence for us" is also completely not what the author meant. Should change "就是给" to "就给了".

"是" and "的". It was mentioned in the fourth paragraph of the first lecture that "是" and "的" are used together in sentences with adjectives as predicates, such as "那是危险的". Similarly, "是……的" is also often used in sentences with verbs as the main component of the predicate, such as "你是知道的" "我是不去的". Generally speaking, sentences using "是……的" have a heavier tone and stronger certainty than sentences that do not use them; therefore, whether or not to add "是……的" is sometimes worth considering. We will not discuss this now, but only point out one thing: "是" and "的" must be used in coordination. (There are also cases where only "是" is used, with a heavier tone than when used together, such as "我是不去"; there are also cases where only "的" is used, with a lighter tone than when used together, such as "你知道的" - these will not be discussed here.) The following two sentences have "是" but no "的":

(14) There are many Liao Dynasty city sites and aristocratic tombs in this area. (Journal)
(15) The preparatory meeting of the four foreign ministers is to determine the scope of the matters to be discussed at the four foreign ministers' meeting. (Journal) (14) If you want a slightly heavier tone than usual, you should add a "的" to coordinate with the word "是"; if there is no need to add weight, the word "是" is redundant. (15) It is not narrating the process of the preparatory meeting, but explaining its task, so "是……的" is needed, but you cannot just use the word "是" without using the word "的". ("将要讨论的范围" should be "将要讨论的事项的范围", because the foreign ministers' meeting will discuss substantive matters, and the preparatory meeting will discuss the scope of these matters.) The following two sentences have "的" but no "是":

(16) The survival of Korea is closely related to the safety of China. (Journal)
(17) Individual help and education for individual league members and young workers with heavier ideological burdens or who are fragile is extremely insufficient. (Journal) (16) It should be used with an emphasized tone, and since there is "的" at the end, the word "是" in front is indispensable. The word "有" can be optional, maybe it would be better to cancel it, rather than using "关联" as a noun, it is better to let it be a verb. (17) Either add a "是" or cancel "的". When the predicate is an adjective, the difference in tone between adding "是……的" or not is limited.

The following three sentences are another situation:

(18) The propaganda and mobilization work in the factory is an important part of the Party's work, it is the Party's use of political work methods to educate employees, improve employees' awareness, encourage employees' production enthusiasm, turn the Party's various policies in the enterprise into practical activities of the masses, and ensure the completion and exceeding of production plans. (Book)
(19) The democratic forces defending world peace have become not only developing in the socialist Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and colonial and semi-colonial countries, but also developing in various capitalist countries. (Journal)
(20) Turning oneself, who originally had no right to accept surrender, into having all the rights to accept surrender. (Book) The second "是" in (18), following the above text, should have a noun as a predicate, but it does not. If this clause is changed to "is the political work of the Party to educate employees...exceed production plans", such a long modifier is also not acceptable. I am afraid that we can only remove the word "是" and change it to "The Party wants to use the method of political work ("方法" is inappropriate) to educate employees...". (19) uses "成为", (20) uses "变成", the functions of these two verbs are similar to but not the same as the word "是", they require the structure before and after to be consistent, if the subject is a noun, the predicate can only be a noun. But the predicates of these two sentences are both verbs. In fact, there is no need to use "成为" and "变成" here, (19) can be changed to "Now not only...", (20) can be changed to "Make...enjoy...".

    语法、修辞讲话（第四讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第三段  表语
    表语和主语配合不当。必须甲事物是乙事物，才能用“是”字。这好像是句废话，可是许多句子犯错误，就因为忽视这个极其浅显的道理。不错，我们有一些跟这个原则冲突的习惯语，例如“今天这个会是谁的主席？”“会”不能是“主席”。“这个案子是张三的原告，李四的被告，”“案子”也不能是“原告”和“被告”。但习惯语之所以为习惯语，就在于不容许援例。下面这些句子都是似是而非的。
    （一）因为我们是工人阶级领导的国家。（书）
    （二）懂得农民与工人是同样可怜的命运。（书）
    （三）可是事实上，问题从这里才仅仅是一个开始。（期）
    （四）我觉得这个答复，和对这些问题的调查处理，都是一种不负责任的态度。（信）（一）该说“我们的国家是工人阶级领导的”。（二）该说“农民与工人的命运是同样悲惨的”（用“可怜”形容“命运”，不如用“悲惨”）。（三）该说“这仅仅是问题的开始”。（四）该把“是”改做“表示”。底下的句子就连“似是”也谈不上了。
    （五）显然，摆在翻译工作者面前的任务就是如何提高翻译工作质量的问题了。（期）
    （六）可是这种开垦和耕耘的工作是农民的劳动力，既不是地主的钱，也不是地主的统治权势。（报）
    （七）本年一月份解放军战绩，是两年半解放战争以来最辉煌的一个月。（期）（五）“任务”不能是“问题”，两个必须去掉一个。（如果去掉“问题”，“如何”也得连带取消，“的”字得挪在“质量”之前。）（六）“工作”不能是“力”“钱”和“权势”，应该说“完成这种……工作的是……”。（七）应该说“本年一月份是两年半以来的解放战争中战绩最辉煌的一个月”。（“解放军”可省，解放战争的战绩当然是指解放军的战绩；“两年半解放战争以来”也不妥。）
    （八）所有上海的市民都被两种情感紧紧抓住，一种是沉痛的回忆，一种是愤怒的呐喊。（期）
    （九）这些机器、工具的创造、发明与改进，对生产效率的提高都是一倍、数倍、以至几十倍数百倍。（期）
    （十）这样重复的课程当然增加了同学们很大的负担，对于青年的健康问题是个极大的矛盾。（期）
    （十一）任何一个政府，当它开始同国内进步的力量作对时，也正是它自己要崩溃的信号。（期）（八）“回忆”和“呐喊”不能叫做“情感”，也没有别的词能概括这两个行为。这一句只能改做“所有上海的市民，一方面唤起沉痛的回忆，一方面发出愤怒的吼声”（“呐喊”不妥）。（九）的不通非常明显，改起来也极容易：“……把生产效率提高了一倍、几倍……”。不懂作者为什么不采取这样清清爽爽的说法，要那么扭来扭去。（“创造”和“发明”是一件事，用一个够了；“数”和“几”乱用，也没有道理，应一律用“几”。）（十）无论是“课程”还是整个的第一分句，都不能是“矛盾”，也不能跟“问题”发生矛盾。只能说“跟注意青年健康的政策是矛盾的”。（“增加了同学们很大的负担”也应改做“……很多负担”或“大大地增加……”）（十一）“政府”不能是“信号”。这一句应删去“当它”和“时”，把“也正是”改做“那就是”。最后，有两个例子可以说明表语和主语配合不当，能产生跟本来意思不同甚至相反的意义。
    （十二）但是在这一次谈判中亲身体验到，帝国主义与国民党的造谣完全不是事实。（报）
    （十三）他这个工作的本身就是给我们很大的激动和信心。（期）（十二）说“帝国主义与国民党的造谣”不是“事实”，等于说他们没有造谣。难道作者的意思真是这样吗？应该说“帝国主义与国民党的话都是谣言，完全不是事实”。（十三）说“这个工作”就是“给我们很大的激动和信心”，也完全不是作者的意思。应该把“就是给”改做“就给了”。
      “是”和“的”。第一讲第四段里说起过，“是”和“的”配合起来，用在谓语为形容词的句子里，如“那是危险的”。同样，“是……的”也常常用在谓语以动词为主要成分的句子里，例如“你是知道的”“我是不去的”。一般地说，用“是……的”的句子比不用的句子，语气重些，肯定性强些；所以要不要加“是……的”，有时候值得斟酌。我们现在不讨论这个，只指明一件事：“是”和“的”要配合起来用。（也有单用“是”的，语气比合用的更重，如“我是不去”；也有单用“的”的，语气比合用的轻些，如“你知道的”——这些，这里也不讨论。）下面这两句有“是”无“的”：
    （十四）这一带是有许多辽代城址和贵族的坟墓。（期）
    （十五）四国外长会议预备会议，是决定四国外长会议将要讨论的范围。（期）（十四）假如要比平常语气略重，应该加个“的”字跟“是”字配合；假如无须加重，“是”字就是多余的。（十五）不是叙述预备会议的经过，而是说明它的任务，所以“是……的”是需要的，但是不能光用“是”字，不用“的”字。（“将要讨论的范围”应为“将要讨论的事项的范围”，因为外长会议要讨论的是实质事项，预备会议讨论的才是这些事项的范围。）下面这两句有“的”无“是”：
    （十六）朝鲜的存亡与中国的安危有密切关联的。（期）
    （十七）对个别思想负担较重或脆弱的团员及青工，个别帮助与教育极不够的。（期）（十六）是应该用加重的语气的，后面既有“的”，前面的“是”字必不可少。“有”字倒可有可无，也许取消了好些，与其把“关联”当名词用，不如让它做动词。（十七）要就加个“是”字，要就取消“的”字。谓语是形容词的时候，加“是……的”与否，语气轻重相差有限。
    底下三句是另外一种情形：
    （十八）工厂中的宣传鼓动工作是党的重要工作的一部分，是党用政治工作的方法教育职工，提高职工觉悟，鼓舞职工生产情绪，把党在企业中的各种政策变成群众的实际活活，保证完成并超过生产计划。（书）
    （十九）保卫世界和平的民主力量，成为不仅在社会主义苏联、人民民主国家、殖民地半殖民地国家里发展，也在各资本主义国家里发展。（期）
    （二十）把本来没有受降权利的自己，变成享有受降的全部权利。（书）（十八）的第二个“是”字，顺着上文下来，后面应该有一个名词做表语，但是没有。如果把这个分句改成“是党教育职工……超过生产计划的政治工作”，这么长的附加语也不行。恐怕只能去掉“是”字改做“党要用政治工作的方式（“方法”不妥）教育职工……”。（十九）用“成为”，（二十）用“变成”，这两个动词的作用跟“是”字相近而不相同，它们要求前后的构造一致，如果主语是名词，表语也只能是名词。但是这两句的表语都是动词。其实这里不必用“成为”和“变成”，（十九）可以改做“现在不仅……”，（二十）可以改做“使……享有……”。
                                         （本段完，全文未完）
