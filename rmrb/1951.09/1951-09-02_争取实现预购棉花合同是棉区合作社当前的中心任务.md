Striving to Fulfill Pre-Purchase Cotton Contracts is the Central Task of Cotton-Producing Area Cooperatives
    Liang Yao
    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government signed an agreement on pre-purchasing cotton to develop pre-purchase cotton business. Since March of this year, cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas have actively launched a campaign to sign pre-purchase cotton contracts. In the past six months, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and through the active efforts of cooperative cadres at all levels, as of the end of August, incomplete statistics show that the four major administrative regions of North China, East China, Northwest China, and Central and South China have signed pre-purchase contracts for 4.9 million dan of ginned cotton, exceeding the estimated quantity required by the Ministry of Trade. At present, the work of signing pre-purchase contracts has come to an end. The central task of cooperatives in cotton-producing areas from now on is to collect the pre-purchased cotton on time and hand it over to the state. The work of recovering pre-purchased cotton includes a series of complex organizational tasks such as cotton purchasing and processing, clearing advance payments in kind, and supplying repayment materials. In order to successfully complete this task, cooperatives in cotton-producing areas should pay attention to the following key tasks:
            Strengthen Unified Organizational Leadership
    Experience from this spring's pre-purchase cotton work and cotton purchasing and storage work has shown that areas that attach importance to organizational leadership have better work results. For example, the Northwest China Cooperative has overfulfilled its pre-purchase task due to its emphasis on this work; conversely, the Henan Province Cooperative neglected this work and only completed 6.7% of the task. In carrying out the work of recovering pre-purchased cotton, cooperative cadres should clearly understand the importance of fulfilling pre-purchase contracts and purchasing cotton, make thorough plans and careful arrangements, and actively organize forces to carry out purchasing work according to the tasks. Combined with patriotic education, cotton farmers should be thoroughly publicized and mobilized to explain the practical reasons why recovering pre-purchased cotton is beneficial to both the country and cotton farmers, so as to raise their political awareness and enable them to fulfill pre-purchase contracts and deliver cotton on time on a conscious and voluntary basis. All of the above work must be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, in close combination with other relevant departments. In order to strengthen the connection between various departments, unify work steps, facilitate market management, and promote work, it is necessary to form a "Pre-Purchase Cotton Acquisition Committee" under the leadership of the Party and the government, in conjunction with relevant departments such as industry and commerce, trade, public security, agriculture, and banking. Cooperatives at all levels in cotton-producing areas should actively promote the establishment of this institution and carry out purchasing work with its assistance, promotion, and specific guidance. On purchase prices, cooperatives should reach a consensus with cotton yarn and cloth companies, stipulating local purchase prices in accordance with the Central Trade Ministry's new cotton purchase price regulations to ensure the actual income of cotton farmers. Close cooperation should be carried out in the work to prevent the occurrence of competitive purchasing to stabilize the market.
        Take Sound Grassroots Cooperatives as the Focus of Purchasing
    Establish Purchasing Organizations in Primary Markets
    Cooperatives in cotton-producing areas should implement the principle of hierarchical division of labor and responsibility. Large administrative region cooperatives and provincial cooperatives mainly strengthen leadership, unify planning, and control the implementation of plans; special district and county cooperatives are responsible for specific organization and guidance; grassroots cooperatives actually implement purchasing work. In areas where cooperatives are established with market towns as the center, grassroots cooperatives should be relied upon as purchasing organizations. In areas where there are only village cooperatives but no cooperatives established with market towns as the center, county cooperatives should organize several village-level cooperatives to jointly establish purchasing stations. In cotton-producing areas where there are only county cooperatives but no grassroots cooperatives have been established, the county cooperative may establish several cotton collection stations in each county, according to the purchasing task and taking into account the convenience of cotton farmers in delivering cotton, without violating the principle of economic accounting. Due to the increase in purchasing organizations, a large number of accountants, graders, stackers, weighers, warehouse keepers, and other staff are needed, especially accountants and graders.
    The source of these personnel can be solved by relying on Party and government departments to adopt methods of transfer training, recruitment, and temporary employment. The Anhui North District Cooperative temporarily hired experienced old merchants and fair old farmers to solve the difficulty of grading cadres. However, these personnel should be loyal and reliable, and be given short-term training. In addition to imparting technical knowledge and methods, special attention should be paid to policy education to establish the concept of serving the people. At present, Shandong, Hebei, Pingyuan, Anhui North and other provinces and regions have paid attention to the training of graders, and have trained more than 3,000 grading cadres (no attention has been paid to training accounting cadres), but other regions have not actively prepared for this work and should quickly find ways to remedy it.
            Do a Good Job in Materials Supply Work
    Coordinating the supply of materials needed by cotton farmers with the purchase of cotton is a very important task, which not only affects the stability of prices after the autumn harvest, but also directly affects the progress of the work of recovering pre-purchased cotton. In order to strengthen this work, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives has signed a material supply agreement with the Central Trade Ministry, under which the trade departments are responsible for supplying materials such as grain, fertilizer, coal, salt, yarn, kerosene, and general merchandise. The supply departments of the cooperatives are responsible for supplying cotton farmers in two ways: (1) Those who have signed sales agency contracts with specialized companies will continue to use the sales agency method. (2) Those who have not signed sales agency contracts will be directly operated by the cooperative, with regional price differences controlled by the cooperative, and profits and losses borne by the cooperative. In order to achieve planned material supply, in addition to earnestly soliciting the opinions of members at the members' congress, understanding the needs, and formulating detailed plans, attention should also be paid to the role of "order forms." In order to ensure supply according to "order forms," a work of revising or supplementing "order forms" should be carried out immediately according to the state's supply capacity, the cooperative's own operating strength, and appropriate consideration of cotton farmers' requirements. In addition, cooperatives should pay attention to the use of local handicraft products to open up sources of goods and meet the needs of cotton farmers (especially the needs of production materials), which is also very important.
    Clearing the advance material for pre-purchased cotton is also work related to material supply, and should be handled in a timely manner. When pre-purchasing cotton, cooperatives, in accordance with the provisions of the pre-purchase cotton agreement, took into account the actual difficulties of cotton farmers and prepaid a portion of materials to cotton farmers (grain, coal, salt, and fertilizer, etc.). When cotton farmers deliver cotton, the cooperative is responsible for clearing it up. The principles of clearing are: (1) The prepaid grain should be cleared separately according to the financial and trade systems, and it is best to uniformly transfer it to trade grain for settlement. (2) The prepaid materials should be converted into cotton at the current local price and returned to the state. In carrying out this work, attention should be paid to the local specific situation, to prevent both the tendency of granting favors and the tendency of forcing recovery regardless of the actual difficulties of cotton farmers. Only in this way can a good foundation be laid for next year's pre-purchase work.
            Vigorously Organize Cotton Processing Work
    In order to ensure the supply of raw cotton according to the state's cotton use plan, cotton processing work should be vigorously organized. According to the amount of cotton pre-purchased by each cooperative and the state's cotton demand, the Central Trade Ministry has formulated a raw cotton demand plan, requiring cooperatives to supply raw cotton according to the plan without delay. Therefore, how to organize forces to complete this plan on schedule is the main purpose of the cooperative's organization of processing this year. Cooperatives should grasp the following links in organizing cotton processing: (1) Give full play to the existing processing capacity, and if conditions permit, machine processing plants can be built; (2) Widely organize the processing tools and labor force of the masses, and try to implement centralized management for supervision and inspection; (3) The fine variety seed cotton that has been pre-purchased in the fine variety breeding area can be processed by the agricultural department according to the spirit of the joint decision of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the Central Ministry of Agriculture, so as to avoid the loss of fine varieties; (4) If all processing capacity cannot complete the state's cotton use plan on schedule, seed cotton should be delivered directly to the cotton yarn and cloth company to avoid delaying the needs of the yarn mill.
    At present, in the organization of processing work, the provincial cooperatives of North China and East China have made considerable preparations. As of the end of July, statistics show that East China has organized a total of 11,707 manpower and power ginneries of various types and 22 baling machines. North China has also organized 17,750 manpower ginneries, 1,463 power ginneries, and 402 baling machines, and is still continuing to organize. This preparation is very necessary, and other regions should also step up their efforts.
                                ×  ×  ×
    Now that new cotton has begun to be marketed, cooperatives at all levels in cotton-producing areas should universally deploy work level by level through meetings. It is necessary to actively organize purchasing forces, give full play to the role of state-owned trade as an assistant, and ensure the completion of the purchase of pre-purchased cotton.

    争取实现预购棉花合同是棉区合作社当前的中心任务
    梁耀
    全国合作总社与中央人民政府贸易部为了开展预购棉花业务，曾订立预购棉花协议书。从今年三月份起，各产棉区合作社就积极地开展了订立预购棉花合同的运动。半年以来，在共产党和人民政府领导下，经过各级合作社干部积极努力，截至八月底的不完整统计，华北、华东、西北、中南四大行政区共签订了四百九十万担皮棉的预购合同，超额完成了贸易部的预计要求数量。目前签订预购合同工作已告一段落。今后产棉区合作社的中心工作，是要把已经预购的棉花，按时收回交给国家。收回预购棉花的工作，包括棉花的收购及加工、预付实物的清理和偿付物资的供应等一系列的复杂的组织工作。为了顺利完成这项任务，产棉区合作社应注意以下几项主要工作：
            加强统一的组织领导
    从今春开展预购棉花工作和购棉储棉工作中证明，凡是重视组织领导的地区，工作成绩就较好。如西北区合作社，就由于重视这一工作，而超额完成预购任务；相反，河南省合作社忽视了这一工作，仅完成任务的百分之六点七。在进行收回预购棉花工作中，应该使合作社干部明确认识履行预购合同、收购棉花的重要意义，周密计划和认真布置，根据任务积极组织力量展开收购工作。对棉农要结合爱国主义教育，深入宣传动员，说明收回预购棉花对国家对棉农都有利的实际道理，以提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们在自觉自愿的基础上，履行预购合同，按时交棉。以上这些工作必须在党和政府的统一领导下，与其他有关部门密切结合进行。为了加强各部门间的联系，统一工作步调，便于市场管理和推动工作，在党和政府领导下，结合工商、贸易、公安、农业、银行等有关部门组成“预购棉花收购委员会”是有必要的。产棉区各级合作社应积极促进这一机构的成立，并在它的协助、推动和具体指导下开展收购工作。在收购价格上，合作社应与花纱布公司取得一致，根据中央贸易部新棉收购牌价规定当地的收购牌价，以保证棉农实际所得。在进行工作中应密切配合，严防争购现象的发生，以稳定市场。
        以健全的基层社为收购重点
    设置初级市场的收购机构
    产棉区合作社应贯彻逐级分工负责的方针。大行政区合作社及省合作社主要是加强领导，统一计划及掌握计划的执行；专区及县合作社负责具体组织指导；基层社实际执行收购工作。在以集镇为中心建立合作社的地区，应依靠基层社为收购机构。在仅有村合作社而未以集镇为中心建立合作社的地区，由县合作社组织几个村基层社联合成立收购站。在只有县社而还没有建立基层社的棉区，县社可根据收购任务，照顾棉农送棉的便利，在不违反经济核算的原则下，每县适当设立几个收花站。由于收购机构的增加，就需要大批的会计、分级、倒堆、过秤、看库等工作人员，尤其是会计人员和分级人员。
    这些人员的来源问题，可以依靠党政部门采用调训、招收和临时雇用的办法加以解决。皖北区社临时雇用有分级经验的旧商人和公正老农，解决了分级干部的困难。但这些人员应求得忠诚可靠，并加以短期训练，除灌输技术知识和方法外，应特别注意政策的教育，以树立为人民服务的观点。目前山东、河北、平原、皖北等省区已经注意分级人员的训练工作，共训练了三千多个分级干部（还未注意训练会计干部），但其他地区对这一工作，尚未见积极进行准备，应该迅速设法补救。
            办好物资供应工作
    配合收购棉花供应棉农所需物资是一件很重要的工作，不仅关系秋后的物价稳定，同时直接影响预购棉花的收回工作的进行。为了加强这项工作，全国合作总社已与中央贸易部签订了供应物资协议，由贸易部门负责供给粮食、肥料、煤、盐、纱布、煤油、百货等物资。合作社的供应部门则采用两种方式负责供应棉农：（一）已与专业公司订立代销合同者，仍采用代销的办法。（二）未订代销合同者，由合作社直接经营，地区差价归合作社掌握，盈亏由合作社负责。为达到有计划地办理物资供应，除认真在社员代表会上征求社员意见、了解需要情况、制定周密计划外，还应重视“订货单”的作用。为了保证按照“订货单”进行供应，应该根据国家的供应能力、合作社自有的经营力量和适当照顾棉农要求，立即进行一次修正或补订“订货单”的工作。此外，合作社应注意运用地方手工业产品，以开辟商品来源，满足棉农的需要（尤其是生产资料方面的需要），也是很重要的。
    清理预购棉花预付物资工作，也是与供应物资有关的工作，应该及时处理。合作社在预购棉花时曾根据预购棉花协议书的规定，照顾棉农实际困难，预付给棉农一部分物资（粮食、煤、盐和肥料等）。这批预付物资，在棉农送交棉花时，合作社要负责加以清理。清理的原则是：（一）预付的粮食应按财政和贸易两个系统分别清理，最好能统一转为贸易粮，以便结账。（二）应把所预付的物资按当时当地牌价折合成棉花归还国家。在进行这一工作时要注意当地具体情况，既要防止恩赐观点，又须防止不顾棉农实际困难的强迫收回的偏向。这样才能为明年的预购工作打下良好基础。
            大力组织棉花加工工作
    为了保证根据国家的用棉计划供应原棉，应大力组织棉花加工工作。根据各社预购棉花的数量和国家需棉情况，中央贸易部已拟订了原棉需用计划，要求合作社不误时宜的按计划供应原棉。因此，如何组织力量按期完成这项计划，是今年合作社组织加工的主要目的。合作社组织棉花加工应掌握以下几个环节：（一）充分发挥现有的加工能力，如果条件具备，可建设机器加工厂；（二）广泛组织群众的加工工具和劳动力，尽力施行集中管理，以便进行监督和检查。（三）在良种繁殖区已经预购的良种籽棉，可根据全国合作总社与中央农业部联合决定的精神，由农业部门加工，以免良种散失。（四）所有加工能力如不能按期完成国家用棉计划时，应直接向花纱布公司送交籽棉，以免贻误纱厂需要。
    目前在组织加工工作上，华北、华东各省社都已有了相当准备，截至七月底统计，华东区已组织人力的动力的各式轧花机共一万一千七百零七台，打包机二十二架。华北区也组织人力轧花机一万七千七百五十台，动力机一千四百六十三台，打包机四百零二架，并仍在继续进行组织中。这种准备工作是很必要的，其他地区也应加紧进行。
                                ×  ×  ×
    现在新花已经开始上市，产棉区各级合作社应普遍地通过会议方式，逐级布置工作。要积极组织收购力量，充分发挥国营贸易的助手作用，保证完成预购棉花的收购工作。
