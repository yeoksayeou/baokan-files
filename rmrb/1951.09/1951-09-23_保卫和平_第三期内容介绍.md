Texts discussing this issue include the editorial "Asia and World Peace" written by Pierre Cot, the news material "Korean Armistice Negotiations, Reactions of Western Countries" written by the magazine's editorial department, "The Brutalities of the American Army in Korea" narrated to the magazine by two democratic women from Latin America, Ms. Vasquez and Mrs. Hernandez, "The Views of the Indian People on the Korean War" by the famous Indian doctor Dr. Edward, "True Peace" by French writer Oehler, "The American Friends Service Committee on America's Asian Policy," "The Vietnam War and the Peace Treaty" by Léon Kahn, and "Indonesia" by Roy Phayans. Claude Roy's "On Our Understanding of Asia" introduces China's glorious ancient culture, and Israel Epstein's "Five Million Peasants Change China's Geography" introduces the great Huai River harnessing project currently being undertaken by the Chinese people. In addition, "Blood and Oil" written by the magazine's editorial department exposes the historical facts of British and American imperialism occupying the oil mining rights of Iran, a country in western Asia, and introduces the Iranian people's just struggle against the plunderers. Baron's short story "Oil Political Strife" describes the ugly features of a small group of politicians in Iran who sell themselves out. Hikmet, the great Turkish poet who was recently released from prison, reports to the magazine on the painful lives of the Turkish people under the rule of foreign imperialism and the reactionary government of their own country, and points out that brutal persecution cannot stop the Turkish people's struggle for survival.
　　Regarding the issue of opposing German rearmament, Gordon Schaffer, in "Obscuring Tactics," states many proposals recently put forward by the German Democratic Republic for a peaceful resolution of the current tense situation; "The Three Musketeers of Concentration Camps" written by Jules Depauna depicts the disasters inflicted by the Hitler gang on peaceful people during World War II.
　　This issue of the magazine also publishes the resolutions of the Helsinki meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and the talks of the representatives who participated in the meeting. There are also two articles on international trade and economic exchange: "Peaceful Coexistence and Independent Trade are Inseparable" and "The International Economic Conference in Moscow."
