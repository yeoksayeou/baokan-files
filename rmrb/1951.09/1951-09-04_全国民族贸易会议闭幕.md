Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: The first National Ethnic Trade Conference concluded on August 31st. Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, delivered a speech at the closing session.

Subsequently, Yao Yilin, Deputy Minister of Trade of the Central People's Government, delivered a summary report of the conference. In his report, he pointed out that under the guidance of the policy of national unity stipulated in the Common Program, the trade work in various minority areas across the country has made great achievements in improving the lives of all ethnic groups, restoring the agricultural and pastoral production of all ethnic groups, and promoting national unity. In the future, state-owned trading companies in minority areas should, under the leadership of the local people's government and in coordination with the various economic departments of the people's government, rely on the people of all ethnic groups to continue to carry out material exchanges in minority areas. State-owned trading companies should also expand the commercial network in minority areas according to the specific conditions of each region; help places with conditions to form cooperatives; help various minority areas to restore and establish regular commercial fairs, and set up branches or mobile teams of state-owned trading companies in these fairs. State-owned trading companies and the industrial and commercial administrative departments of local people's governments should strengthen the management of fairs in terms of listed prices and administrative management, unite legitimate private merchants, and prevent and oppose the economic plunder and deception of minority people by certain private merchants. State-owned trading companies should implement a price policy that takes into account both public and private interests, and is fair and reasonable in minority areas, taking into account the interests of production, transportation, sales, and consumption, so as to ensure the smooth flow of goods. When implementing price policies, it is necessary to support certain handicraft production in a planned way according to needs and possibilities, so as to reduce the supply difficulties of certain materials caused by inconvenient transportation in certain minority areas. In order to improve the specifications and quality of native and special products in minority areas to expand sales, quality price differences should be implemented. In addition, state-owned trading companies should also actively train trade work cadres of minority nationalities.
    The closing ceremony ended after representatives of various ethnic groups from the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Suiyuan Province presented flags to the conference.
