Party Life

    The Yuci Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened the first district-wide rural propaganda cadre representative meeting on August 25th. The meeting enabled all propaganda cadres to understand the working method of addressing the ideological problems of the masses through their daily life and production issues, thereby raising the political consciousness of the masses in order to transform the Party's propositions into the actual actions of the broad masses. Conversely, it also meant reflecting the ideological problems of the masses to the higher-level Party organizations, serving as a reference for the Party to decide and revise its work guidelines and plans. In order to specifically illustrate this point, the meeting introduced the work experience of Du Huasheng, a propaganda cadre representative from Beihouyu in Pingding, and the experience of the Madiyu branch. Du Huasheng, in response to the backward thinking of farmer Wang Zhanlu, propagated the principle of "never forgetting the Communist Party after liberation," guiding Wang Zhanlu to conduct a recollection and comparison of the old and new societies, raising Wang Zhanlu's class consciousness, and transforming this negative element into a positive one. When leading the propaganda network, the Madiyu branch implemented the method of "three transmissions and three investigations," which meant transmitting the content taught by the propaganda station, the central tasks determined by the higher levels, and the content of newspapers to the broad masses; and thoroughly investigating and reporting to the branch the progress of propaganda work, the degree of mass acceptance, and the thoughts and demands of the masses. In this way, the Party and the masses communicated effectively. These work experiences greatly enlightened the propaganda cadres attending the meeting. The meeting also made the propaganda cadres understand that they should adopt various methods to attract the masses' attention to national and village affairs, and to do a good job in various tasks.

    In addition, the meeting determined that the basic content of the propaganda cadres' work recently should be the propaganda of the leadership of the working class and the people's democratic dictatorship. Currently, the following work should be carried out among the masses: (1) Criticizing the erroneous views of underestimating the role of industry, underestimating the role of cities, and "the countryside supporting the cities." To this end, the meeting organized representatives to visit factories, so that they could specifically understand the greatness of large-scale machine production and the working class, in order to return and propagate to the masses the role of industry, the role of the working class, the role of cities, the prospects of national industrialization, and the idea that agricultural production should strive for this prospect. (2) Correctly propagate current events, publicize the balance of power between the two major camps in the world, so that the masses understand that imperialism is bound to die, and socialist countries and people's democratic countries are bound to win. Publicize the great achievements of socialist countries' construction and the happy life of the working people. (3) Educate farmers to correctly understand the relationship between the individual and the country. Explain that the current country is the people's own country, and everyone must cherish it. (4) Propagate the glory of labor and the future of labor. Explain that in the past, labor was for others, but now, after the land reform, labor is for oneself, labor created the People's Republic of China, and labor will create a happier society. (5) At present, we should focus on resolving the ideological problems in the movement of increasing production and making donations and checking patriotic pacts, in order to promote the progress of the movement. Finally, the meeting decided to strengthen ideological leadership and organizational leadership over the propaganda network.

    Editor's Note: Helping propaganda cadres understand the nature, tasks, and methods of propaganda work is the key for the Party committee to lead the propaganda cadres to do their work well. The propaganda cadre representative meeting convened by the Yuci Prefectural Committee initially solved this problem. Party organizations in various places should convene such meetings to solve some fundamental problems for the propaganda cadres.

    榆次地委召开的宣传员代表会议
    中共榆次地方工作委员会在八月二十五日召开了全区第一次农村宣传员代表会议。会议使全体宣传员懂得了进行工作的方法，即通过群众日常的生活、生产问题，解决群众的思想问题，提高群众的政治觉悟，以便把党的主张变成广大群众的实际行动。反转来又把群众的思想问题反映给上级党组织，作为党决定、修改工作方针与计划的参考。为了具体地说明这个问题，会上介绍了平定北后峪宣传员代表杜华胜、麻地峪支部的工作经验。杜华胜针对农民王占禄的落后思想，宣传了“翻身不忘共产党”的道理，引导王占禄进行了新旧社会的回忆对比，提高了王占禄的阶级觉悟，使这个消极分子变为积极分子。麻地峪支部在领导宣传网时，实行了“三传三查”的办法，就是把宣传传授站传授的内容、上级确定的中心工作、报纸上的东西传达给广大群众；把宣传工作的进行情况，群众接受程度，群众思想和要求，调查清楚，报告支部。这样，就使党和群众通了气。这些工作经验，给予到会的宣传员以很大启发。会议又使宣传员懂得了应当采用各种各样的方法，吸引群众关心国事、关心村事，作好各项工作。
    此外，会议确定最近应以宣传工人阶级的领导、人民民主专政等作为宣传员工作的基本内容。目前要在群众中进行以下工作：（一）批判轻视工业作用，轻视城市作用，及“农村养活城市”等错误观点。为此，会议组织各代表参观了工厂，使他们具体了解了大机器生产和工人阶级的伟大，以便回去向群众宣传工业的作用，工人阶级的作用，城市的作用，国家工业化的前途，农业生产要为这个前途而奋斗等等的思想。（二）正确地宣传时事，宣传世界两大阵营的力量对比，使群众懂得帝国主义必然死亡，社会主义国家和人民民主国家必然胜利。宣传社会主义国家建设的伟大成就以及劳动人民的幸福生活。（三）教育农民正确地认识个人和国家的关系。说明现在的国家是人民自己的国家，大家必须爱护它。（四）宣传劳动光荣和劳动前途。说明过去劳动为别人，现在土地改革后，劳动为自己，劳动创造了中华人民共和国，劳动还要创造更幸福的社会。（五）目前应着重解决增产捐献及检查爱国公约运动中的思想问题，以推动运动前进。最后，会议决定对宣传网要加强思想领导、加强组织领导。
    编者按：帮助宣传员了解宣传工作的性质、任务和方法，是党委领导宣传员做好工作的关键。榆次地委召开的宣传员代表会议，初步解决了这个问题。各地党组织都应当召开这种会议，为宣传员解决一些根本的问题。
