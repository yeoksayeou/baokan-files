    Letters Home Report Friendship
    ——"From the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea" - Part 1——
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Prague Wu Wentao

    This year, on an early summer night, I was staying in Stalin Port on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. By summer, I had returned to the Baltic Sea beach in Poland, which I had visited a year before. In between, there were more than three thousand miles, involving Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other countries. However, I didn't feel the exoticism in the general sense. It was like getting along with brothers and sisters, although differences in language, customs, etc., did realistically exist.

    First of all, whether in the midst of滔滔discussions or in relatively understanding situations, I could always understand the love people had for Chairman Mao in the language I used.

    I don't know how many people have asked such a simple question: "Have you ever seen Comrade Mao Zedong with your own eyes?" It was as if my saying "I have" would mean that they had seen him too. Newspaper editors couldn't find a biography of Chairman Mao, so they translated and published the materials from "Red Star Over China" to satisfy readers' requests.

    Everywhere, workers, peasants, and intellectuals studying Chairman Mao's works told me their experiences: Cadres who had participated in the anti-German guerrilla warfare highly praised Chairman Mao's works on strategic and tactical issues. Someone said:
    "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has been read several times. Someone read "On Practice" and said that it was as profound and easy to understand as Stalin's philosophical works. Someone firmly remembered the vivid analogy of Wu Song fighting the tiger and the three main experiences of the Chinese revolution in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." ... Some of these were stipulated by the central committees of the brother parties for cadre study, and some were studied automatically by themselves or in groups. Their common goal was to enrich themselves with the rich experience of the Chinese revolution summarized by Chairman Mao.

    When you hear the marching masses chanting Chairman Mao's name together with the names of their national leaders and the world people's teacher Stalin, when you see workers, even members of remote agricultural cooperatives, enthusiastically approving Chairman Mao as one of the honorary chairmen at a conference to reward labor heroes, or when pedestrians encounter a Chinese delegation that they can identify and wave, shouting "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!"..., you will immediately experience a most sublime respect. This is to express gratitude to Chairman Mao for leading the Chinese people to liberation, and this is to praise the People's China, which has stood tall in the East as a giant, defending world peace on the front line for the past two years!

    The appearance of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea has made the people of these countries raise their eyebrows and exhale. It is obviously not enough to simply interpret their surging support for Korea as general sympathy. Their slogans read: "The Chinese and Korean People's Armies are also shedding blood and fighting for us to be able to build socialism here with peace of mind!" The prestige of the Chinese People's Volunteers heroes is so far-reaching that a middle peasant from a Hungarian cooperative told me the following story himself: Last winter, reactionary Catholics and rich peasant elements secretly threatened him, saying, "Hey! The American army is going to fight in Korea today, will it come here tomorrow? It's better not to join the agricultural cooperative!" So, when many people joined the cooperative, he hesitated a little, until the end of last year when the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army defeated the American aggressors, he deeply realized that his political understanding was lagging behind and resolutely joined the cooperative and worked very actively. As for the reactionaries? They had to disappear in the face of the people's victory!

    I have seen that in the past year or so, the fraternal feelings of love and hate being consistent and sharing the same enemies and friends between our country and the Eastern European brother countries have been enriched by the strengthening of economic and cultural exchanges.

    I remember that last year in a factory in the German Democratic Republic, I saw this slogan: "The quality of products is the foundation of our trade with Moscow and Beijing!" This year, in a factory in Czechoslovakia, the workers pointed out to me that those machines were made for China and expressed that this was their glory. The task of a worker in a Hungarian factory was to specifically print Chinese characters on the boxes of goods shipped to China. He was very interested in this work, but he never understood the meaning of the row of large characters printed. He was convinced that trade between them and our country would develop day by day, and he wanted to ask the factory director to hire someone to teach Chinese. When I told him that the row of words was "Handle with Care," he jumped up and said that this was his first lesson in learning Chinese. Today, people in Eastern Europe who are learning Chinese with the same purpose or to learn more about New China are no longer rare.

    People in Warsaw told me with great interest that they could already buy Chinese silk and rice in their stores. In Prague, people were discussing: "With Chinese tea, why do we have to use US dollars to buy coffee?" The elders and brothers in our homeland who grow peanuts probably never imagined that housewives who were lining up in long queues, waiting to buy one kilogram of shelled peanuts, which they hadn't tasted in more than a decade, for 300 crowns (approximately 120,000 RMB), were saying with gratitude: "What we don't have, the Soviet Union and China can supply us!" In other words, people clearly understand that with the infinite resources of the Soviet Union and China, there is no need to fear the so-called blockade of US imperialism. This is why the exhibits at the Leipzig Fair and the Prague International Exhibition made people feel so powerful. The development of our country's industry in the past year has been like a spring thunder, giving people a shocking excitement. People not only look forward to our raw materials, not only crave our bananas, oranges, and other fruits that are not produced in Eastern Europe, but also envy many of our industrial products. Because all the brother countries are vying to invite them for exhibition, these exhibits are still traveling around the countries!

    Equally valued are our cultural exhibitions, movies, and performances by cultural troupes. People say that "Daughter of China" and "Steel Soldier" are good works that embody the revolutionary qualities and integrity of the Chinese people and have universal educational significance; and from "Daughter of China" to "Steel Soldier," it marks the progress of our country's cultural undertakings in the past year. In Poland, our acrobatic troupe received unanimous praise. These things, together with books, photos, and news reports, are the source for Eastern European brother countries to understand all aspects of the lives of our people. People's hope is nothing but "more publicity and reporting, more and more."

    In my contact with people from all walks of life in Eastern European countries, women asked about the situation of women in New China, young people inquired about the lives of our young people, writers talked about Chinese works..., I remember: Ma Hengchang, Tian Guiying and these names have been mentioned more than once. Workers and cadres in the Danube-Black Sea Canal project area in Romania asked about our Huai River management plan bit by bit, wanting to know the impact of this project on our national economy and people's livelihood after its completion, just as they clearly understood the significant impact of the completion of their canal on the Romanian economy.

    When I was in a thousand-foot-deep coal mine in Upper Silesia, Poland, talking with miners with safety lamps, they asked me point-blank about the highest mining record of Chinese miners, and asked me to convey their greetings to their Chinese industry brothers. I wanted to write down their experience in improving production. Some said it was based on organization, some said it was based on mechanization, and another young man said: "Comrade, please write this: The most important thing is that everyone clearly realizes that one more ton of coal is not just an increase in our wages, but also makes our People's Poland stronger!" He also told me that he had been selected as a Polish representative to the Berlin Peace Youth Festival and wanted me to sign his diary so that he could take it to visit the Chinese miner representatives.

    A Bulgarian cooperative farmer is an old hand at planting cotton. He is concerned about the cooperative movement of our country's farmers and is more willing to exchange experiences with our cotton farmers through correspondence so as to jointly increase cotton production and strike at American imperialism. The reason is as he said, "Now other people's democratic countries produce less cotton, do you want American cotton? Then you have to accept Wall Street's conditions for national subjugation."

    I would like to take this opportunity to report on the situation of overseas Chinese living in Eastern Europe. In these countries, there are from three or five to dozens of them. The vast majority of them were forced to drift to Europe more than a dozen or even decades ago due to hunger and cold, doing small business or relying on acting for a living, and their situation was extremely miserable. It is not difficult to imagine the discrimination of the old rulers against them. The Kuomintang's "black market ambassadors" and "Omega ladies" (Note: named after smuggling Swiss watches under the cover of diplomatic passports) were even more specialized in exploiting them, until the establishment of the Eastern European people's democratic regimes, they were able to obtain the social status of ordinary people; the liberation of the motherland made them feel that they could hold their heads high in front of others. This is why when they heard about the surging patriotic donation movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in their motherland, they also actively participated.

    I know a overseas Chinese with the surname Tang living in Hungary, he is an artist and often goes to other countries to perform. In his letter to his wife (a Hungarian), he often told her to educate their nine-year-old son Tangshan to love the liberated motherland. Last year, Tangshan ranked first in the whole class and was selected as a model student. When answering the teacher's question "Who is your leader? Which countries are your country's neighbors?" all the Hungarian children, of course, wrote Comrade Rakosi..., but Tangshan wrote: "Our leader is Mao Zedong." "Our neighboring countries are the Soviet Union, Korea, Vietnam, and India." He told me that his biggest wish is that one day he can return to his motherland, which he has never seen, with his whole family and serve the motherland!

    A visit of more than a month has given me a great education—an education in internationalism and patriotism, making me experience the glory of being a people of Chairman Mao. Thanks to the selfless help of the Soviet Union, these brother countries have already walked ahead of us, and we should learn from them. There is such a saying circulating here: "Ask us about the population of the family? 800 million!" This is their relationship with the great Soviet Union, this is their relationship with us - the New China under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

    Whether it is Sofia or Warsaw, Tirana or Berlin, they are tens of thousands of miles away from the capital of our motherland. This distance does not exist at all in our thoughts and feelings. Only in one sense does it proudly exist, that is, the enormous scale of the victory of Marxism-Leninism on Earth, and the powerful invincibility of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.

### 家书报友情 ——“从黑海到波罗的海”之一——

    家书报友情
    ——“从黑海到波罗的海”之一——
    新华社驻布拉格记者  吴文焘
    今年，一个初夏的夜里，我旅居在保加利亚黑海滨的斯大林港。到暑天，我又回到一年前曾经游览过的波兰的波罗的海滩头。这中间，是三千多里的路程，有保、罗、匈、捷、波等国别。但是，我感觉不到一般意义上的异国情调，总像是在和兄弟姊妹们相处，虽然语言、习俗等的差异，都现实地存在着。
    首先，不管在滔滔的议论中，或在相对会意的场合，我随时都可以领会人们对我所使用的一种语言——对于毛主席的热爱。
    不知道有多少人问过这样一个朴素的问题：“你可曾亲眼看见过毛泽东同志？”好像我说“见过”就等于他们也见过了似的。报纸的编辑找不到毛主席的传记，就译载“西行漫记”里的材料，来满足读者的要求。
    到处，研究毛主席著作的工农和知识分子向我谈出他们的体验：参加过抗德游击战争的干部们对毛主席关于战略战术问题的著作极为称赞。有人说：
    “在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”已经读过好几遍了。有人读了“实践论”，说它像斯大林的哲学著作那样深入浅出，容易理解。有人牢记着“论人民民主专政”中武松打虎的生动比喻和中国革命的三件主要经验。……这，有的是兄弟党中央规定的干部学习的，有的是自己或在小组中自动研究的。他们一致的目的是：用毛主席所总结的丰富的中国革命的经验来丰富自己。
    当你听到游行的群众把毛主席的名字和他们本国领袖与世界人民的导师斯大林的名字连起来欢呼时，当你看到工人们，甚至偏远的农业合作社社员在奖励劳动英雄的大会上热烈通过毛主席为名誉主席之一时，或者，当走路的人遇到他们所能识别出来的中国代表团，而喊着“毛泽东！毛泽东！”来招手示意时……，你会立刻体验到一种最崇高的敬意，这是表示感激毛主席领导中国人民得到解放，这是歌颂两年来人民中国在以巨人的姿态巍立在东方保卫世界和平的最前线！
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的出现，使得这些国家的人民扬眉吐气。如果把他们所展开的风起云涌的援朝运动单单解释为一般的同情，那显然是不够的。他们的标语写着：“中朝人民军也是在为我们能安心在这里建设社会主义而流血奋斗！”中国人民志愿军英雄们的声威是这样远播着，一个匈牙利合作社的中农亲自告诉我这样的故事：去年冬天，反动天主教和富农分子暗中向他恐吓说：“嘿！美军今天去打朝鲜，明天会不会来这里呢？还是不加入农业合作社为妙啊！”这样，在很多人入社的时候，他就有些迟疑，直到去年年底中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军打垮了美国侵略者的进攻，他才深悟自己的政治认识落后，坚决入了社，而且劳动得非常积极。至于反动分子们呢？他们不得不在人民的胜利面前消声敛迹了！
    我看到：一年多来，我国和东欧兄弟国家间憎爱
    一致、敌友与共的手足之情，更由经济文化的加强交流而充实起来。
    记得，去年我在德意志民主共和国一个工厂里，看到这样一条标语：“生产品的质量，是我们和莫斯科、北京交易的基础！”今年，在捷克斯洛伐克某工厂里，工人们指给我看那些机器是为中国造的，并表示这是他们的光荣。匈牙利某工厂一个工人的任务，是专门在运往中国的货品箱上刷印中国字。他对这项工作很感兴趣，但始终不了解印的那排大字的意义。他认定他们和我国之间的贸易会日益发展，就想要求厂长请人教中文。当我告诉他那排字是“小心轻放”时，他跳着说这是他学中文的第一课。今天，抱着和这个同样的目的或为了更多地了解新中国而学中文的人，在东欧已经不是稀有的了。
    华沙的人们兴致勃勃地向我说：在他们的商店里，已经可以买到中国的丝绸和大米了。在布拉格，人们议论着：“有了中国茶，我们何必用美金去买咖啡呢？”祖国种花生的父老兄弟们，大概不会料想到：在排着长长的队伍、等着以三百克朗（约合十二万人民币）购买一公斤十几年来未曾尝到的带皮落花生的主妇们，在用感激的口吻说：“我们没有的，苏联和中国都可以供给我们！”换句话说，人们清楚了解：有了苏联和中国的无限富源，就不怕美帝国主义的所谓封锁。这就是为什么我们在莱比锡博览会和布拉格国际展览会上的展览品，那样使人感到力量。一年来我国工业的发展，更像一声春雷似的，给人以一种吃惊的兴奋。人们不仅盼望着我们的原料，不仅渴望着我们的香蕉、橘子之类东欧不生产的水果，而且还在羡慕着我们很多的工业品。由于各兄弟国家都争着请去展览，到现在，这些展览品还在周游列国呢！
    同样受到珍视的，是我们的文化展览品、电影和文工团的表演等。人们说：“中华女儿”和“钢铁战士”这些片子，是体现中国人民革命品质和气节的、富有普遍教育意义的好作品；而从“中华女儿”到“钢铁战士”，又标志着一年来我国文化事业进步的里程。在波兰，我们的杂技团得到了一致的好评。这些东西再加上图书、照片和新闻通讯，是东欧兄弟国家了解我国人民各方面生活的来源。人们的希望没有别的，只是“宣传报道的东西更多些，更多些。”
    在我和东欧各国各界人士的接触中，妇女们询问关于新中国妇女的情形，青年们打听我们的青年的生活，作家谈中国的作品……，我记得：马恒昌、田桂英这些名字，曾经不止一次地被提到过。罗马尼亚多瑙河——黑海运河工程区的工人和干部们，一点一滴地问我们的治淮计划，想知道这个工程完成后对于我们国计民生的影响，正像他们清楚了解他们的运河告成时，对于罗马尼亚经济的重大影响
    一样。
    当我在波兰上西里西亚一个千尺深的煤井里，打着安全灯和矿工们谈话时，他们劈头就问我国矿工采掘的最高纪录，同时要我代为问候他们的中国同业兄弟。我想写下他们提高生产的经验。有的说是靠组织，有的说是靠机械化，又有一个青年说：“同志，请这样写：最重要的是大家清楚地意识到：多一吨煤，不只是我们的工资增加，而且是我们的人民波兰更加富强！”他还告诉我，他已被选为波兰出席柏林和平联欢节的代表，要我替他在日记本上签个名，以便拿着去拜会中国的矿工代表。
    一个保加利亚的合作农民是植棉老手。他关心着我国农民的合作运动，更愿和我国棉农们通讯交换经验，以便共同增产棉花，打击美国帝国主义。原因就像他所说的，“现在其他各人民民主国家产棉较少，要美棉吗？那就得接受华尔街的亡国条件。”
    我愿意趁这个机会报告一下住在东欧的侨胞的情况。在这几个国家里，他们有三、五至数十人不等。绝大多数是十几年前，甚至几十年前迫于饥寒，流落到欧洲来，作点小买卖或靠演技为生的，情景极为凄苦。旧的统治者们对他们的歧视，是不难想像的。国民党的“黑市大使”和“亚米茄夫人”（按：由利用外交护照作掩护，私运瑞士手表得名）们，更专门压榨他们，直到东欧人民民主政权建立，他们才得到了一般人的社会地位；祖国的解放，才使得他们感觉在别人面前能够抬起头来。这就是为什么当听到祖国澎湃的抗美援朝爱国捐献运动时，他们也踊跃参加了。
    我知道一个住在匈牙利的唐姓的侨胞，他是一个艺人，常到别国去表演。他在给他夫人（匈牙利人）的信里，经常嘱咐她要教育九岁的儿子唐山热爱解放了的祖国。去年，唐山在全班考了第一名，被选为模范学生。在回答教员所出的题目“你们的领袖是谁？你们国家的邻居是何国？”的时候，所有的匈牙利小朋友们，当然都写了拉科西同志……，唐山却写着：“我们的领袖是毛泽东。”“我们的邻国是苏联、朝鲜、越南和印度。”他和我说，他最大的愿望，就是有一天能和全家回到他没有见过面的祖国，为祖国服务！
    一个多月时间的访问，使我受到很大的教育——国际主义、爱国主义的教育，使我体验到作一个毛主席的人民的光荣。由于苏联的无私帮助，这些兄弟国家已经走在我们前面，我们应当向他们学习。有这样一句话在这里流行着：“问我们家庭的人口吗？八万万！”这就是他们和伟大苏联的关系，这就是他们和我们——毛主席领导下的新中国的关系。
    不论索非亚或华沙，地拉那或柏林，都和我们祖国的首都遥距数万里。这个距离，在我们之间的思想情感上，是根本不存在的。只有在一种意义上，它昂然存在着，那就是马列主义在地球上胜利的巨大规模，和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的强大无敌。
