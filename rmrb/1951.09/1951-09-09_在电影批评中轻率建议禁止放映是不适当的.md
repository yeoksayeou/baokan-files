    In Film Criticism, Lightly Suggesting a Ban on Screenings is Inappropriate
    Recently, in readers' letters to this newspaper regarding film criticism, and in some film reviews published in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other local newspapers, there have been rash suggestions to ban the screening of certain films. This is inappropriate. This thinking stems from a lack of understanding of the principled distinction between the Party and the People's Government's attitude towards films with reactionary content and films with erroneous and flawed content but not reactionary content. For the former, because it is anti-people and illegal, strict measures to ban screenings should be adopted; for the latter, because it belongs to erroneous thoughts and shortcomings within the people, criticism and self-criticism should be adopted, and administrative orders to ban screenings should not be adopted. However, some film critics and newspaper editors do not understand or are not good at grasping this basic principle, and rashly suggest banning screenings in their criticisms, showing a simplistic and crude attitude towards ideological work. The Tianjin Daily recently published two criticisms of the films "New Grievances of the Boudoir" and "Blood Sea of Vengeance." The former severely criticized the film company for "irresponsible and indiscriminate distribution and copying," and "hoped that the authorities would take effective measures"; the latter also said that the Tianjin Daily had criticized the film for three consecutive days, but failed to attract "the attention of the film industry leadership," etc. It is entirely necessary for these articles to criticize the films themselves, but it is inappropriate to make suggestions for administrative measures beyond criticism. Some of the letters related to film criticism received by this newspaper also expressed this idea of simply "banning" certain films. This phenomenon should attract the attention of newspaper editors and film critics.

### 在电影批评中轻率建议禁止放映是不适当的

    在电影批评中轻率建议禁止放映是不适当的
    最近从读者给本报的有关电影批评的来信中，以及发表在上海、天津和其他地方报纸上的一部分电影批评中，有轻率提出禁映某些影片的建议。这是不适当的。这种思想，是由于不了解党和人民政府对待内容反动的影片，与对待内容有错误和有缺点，但不反动的影片，所采取的态度有原则性的区别而产生的。对于前者，因为它是反人民的、非法的，所以要采取严格禁演的措施；对于后者，因为它是属于人民内部的错误思想和缺点，所以要采取批评与自我批评的方式，而不能采取行政命令禁演的方式。但有些电影批评者和报纸编辑，却不明了或不善于掌握这个基本原则，而在批评中轻率建议禁映，表现了对待思想工作的一种简单化的粗鲁的态度。天津日报最近发表了两篇对“新闺怨”、“血海仇”两影片的批评。前一篇严厉指责影片公司“不负责任的滥发行、滥拷贝”，“希望当局作有效的处置”；后一篇也说天津日报曾连续三天对该影片进行了批评，未能引起“电影业领导方面的重视”等等。这些文章对影片本身提出批评，是完全需要的，但连带提出采取批评以外的行政措施的建议，就不妥当了。本报收到的一部分有关电影批评的来信中，也表现了这种要求简单地“禁演”某些影片的思想。这种现象，应引起报刊编辑及电影批评者的注意。
