Now I will report to the conference on the development of the independent reform movement of the Catholic Church in Beijing and some ideological issues related to our independent reform movement.

Some people say: Chinese Catholicism is a religion and has nothing to do with imperialism, nor has it been a tool for imperialist aggression against China. There are no imperialist elements in Catholicism.

Is this statement and view factual? We have countless historical facts and evidence to prove that this statement and view are completely untrue. Catholicism is a religion, but after Catholicism entered China, imperialism followed, and imperialism quickly turned Catholicism into a sharp weapon for aggression against China. The large-scale imperialist aggression against China began with the Opium War in 1840, but as early as 1807 to 1830, British missionaries Morrison, German missionaries GÃ¼tzlaff, and American missionaries Bridgman came to China one after another, selling opium and gathering intelligence. The American missionary Bridgman said, "We who preach in China do so more for political reasons than for religious reasons." American imperialism was the first to openly use religion to invade China. In 1844, the Treaty of Wanghia, which the United States forced China to sign, included "the United States has the right to preach in the five treaty ports." If imperialism did not use religion as a tool for aggression, why would it include the right to preach in a treaty of aggression against China? Preaching is not a national matter, why should it be included in a treaty between countries? In 1858, American Minister William Bradford Reed said in a letter to American Secretary of State Lewis Cass: "I must mention the efforts made by those associated with missionaries and missionary movements, which are very important to the interests of our country (the United States). Without their help, I would simply be unable to fulfill my responsibilities here. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to them for their help and constant valuable advice." Imperialism not only relied on churches and missionaries to scout, gather information, and act as vanguards of aggression, but also used the Chinese people's resistance to the oppression of foreign missionaries as an excuse to launch armed aggression. In 1897, German imperialism occupied Shandong under the pretext of the so-called "Juye Incident." The "Yiwunlu" published by the Shanghai Catholic Church at that time openly stated: "This occupation of Jiaozhou Bay, under the pretext of the murder of missionaries, is in fact a long-planned scheme." The older generation of Catholics in Beijing can still remember the invasion of China by the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, the year of the Boxer Rebellion. At that time, Waldersee, the commander of the Eight-Nation Alliance, clearly stated in his notes the fact that imperialism used Catholicism as a tool for aggression. He said: "Most of the information about the interior was obtained with the help of Catholic priests, and this help came from their willingness. However, Bishop Favier (Bishop of the Xishiku Church in Beijing), a very experienced and intelligent bishop, unfortunately left China for Rome a few days ago. Before leaving, he instructed his representative, Bishop Jarlin, to do his best to help me. Therefore, when Count Yorck advanced to Zhangjiakou, many priests accompanied the army to assist."

Like the facts mentioned above, there are countless examples in the hundred-year history of imperialist aggression against China; it can be said that every action of imperialist aggression against China has the participation of imperialist elements in our Catholicism. Perhaps some people think that this is the history of the past, and the current Catholicism is not like this. This view is also not in accordance with the facts. During the period of Japanese aggression against China and the period when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang ruled China, and even during the Liberation War and after liberation, there are countless facts proving that Catholicism was used by imperialist elements as a tool to invade China and oppose the Chinese people. The major espionage case cracked by the Jizhong Liberated Area People's Government in Zhangjiazhuang, Xian County, in 1947 was committed by Catholic Deputy Bishop Shang Jianxun and four other foreign priests and one Chinese priest. They spied on information, set up private radio stations, provided intelligence to American spies, and lured the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to attack the liberated areas. The armed rebellion organization "Catholic Patriotic Corps" cracked in Shijiazhuang in April 1949 was a counter-revolutionary group organized by a large number of Catholic priests. They gave the US-Chiang planes bombing targets, killing and wounding more than 130 people in Shijiazhuang alone. The case of Catholic Bishop Ford cracked in Meixian County, Guangdong this year, the case of Catholic priest Ge Weide cracked in Gui Sui, and Madi Nuo in the case of Li Andong and others who conspired to armed riots cracked in our Beijing, these imperialist elements in Catholicism either spied on information to supply to Japanese and American aggressors, or hid military supplies and weapons, or participated in the conspiracy of armed riots. A large number of foreign priests were also found with intelligence and military supplies and weapons. These are all facts before our eyes, known to all Catholics and representatives. From these facts, we can see what our Catholicism has been ruined into by these imperialist elements! Based on these criminal facts, can we still say that imperialism has not used our Catholicism as a tool for aggression? Can we still say that there are no imperialist elements in our Catholicism? Can we still say that our Catholicism should not be reformed, should not eliminate these filth, and should not break contact with imperialism?

Some people say: Even if there are these imperialist elements and other bad elements, such as secret agents, traitors, bullies, and hooligans, in Catholicism, they are only personal problems and have nothing to do with our entire Catholicism. Is this view correct? I think this is incorrect, wrong. Since Catholicism is a religion that spreads the truth of God, it will never allow these bad elements to do evil and let them contaminate our religious cause. There is an idiom that says, "A piece of stinking meat spoils the whole pot of soup." We must not allow these bad elements to turn our Catholicism into a group that betrays the motherland and the Chinese people. This is a very clear principle.

Some people also say: Reform is "splitting the church," "destroying the church," and will go to hell, lose the soul, and is "apostasy." This is exactly the nonsense used by those imperialist elements to threaten us and obstruct our participation in the reform movement. From the facts mentioned above, we can see that if Chinese Catholicism is not reformed and the imperialist elements and all evil forces are not eliminated, it will completely become an instrument of imperialist aggression; if we Catholic members do not participate in the reform movement, we will inevitably fall into the clutches of demons and unknowingly become the pawns of imperialism and the sinners of the Chinese nation. This is precisely splitting our Catholicism from China, making our Catholic members betray the Chinese people. This should go to hell, this is losing the soul. How can a Chinese who does not love his country and listens to the dictates of imperialism still be said to have a soul? From beginning to end, our Bible does not have a single sentence prohibiting our believers from loving their motherland. God will never send a patriotic believer to hell; on the contrary, being able to love one's motherland and compatriots is qualified to enter heaven. Those who betray the motherland and listen to the deception and instructions of imperialism should fall into hell, not ascend to heaven, and are truly soulless.

Some people think that Catholics should not speak out about the sins of others and should not accuse the priests who are imperialist elements. Is this view correct? I think it is incorrect, wrong. Like the sinful acts committed by those imperialist elements, what it harms is not only our Catholicism, but also our country and all the people of China. If we do not expose their crimes, then we ourselves are also committing a crime, that is, we agree with them invading China and oppressing the Chinese people. It is entirely appropriate for us to expose their crimes. This is our sacred duty. Does our Catholicism allow people to commit crimes, but not allow others to stop these criminal acts? Does our Catholicism
   Is it a religion that only allows imperialism to invade China, but does not allow the Chinese people to resist aggression? Do imperialist elements have the right to destroy China by taking advantage of Catholicism, and Chinese patriotic Catholics do not have the right to expose their crimes and defend their motherland?

Some people think that we Catholics only believe in God and do not participate in political activities. This idea is exactly the result of being deceived by imperialist elements and falling for their tricks. The many historical facts and cracked counter-revolutionary cases I just mentioned can prove that imperialist elements in Catholicism not only participate in political activities, but also participate in all imperialist aggression activities, including armed aggression. The scum of Catholicism, Yu Bin, was a secret agent and running dog of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang government. Libere, who was just expelled, praised Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and served the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Who can say that they do not participate in political activities? They prohibit us Chinese Catholics from participating in political activities, only one meaning, is not allowed us to love the country, only allowed them to do activities to invade China, not allowed us to participate in activities to love the motherland.

All the above-mentioned incorrect statements and views, although they have existed in the minds of our Catholics, are mainly the result of those imperialist elements deceiving us for a long time. Now we have improved our awareness through study, our eyes have been opened, and nothing can deceive us. With the help of the government and the people of the whole country, we have been liberated from the clutches of imperialism. This is our victory and the victory of the people of the whole of China.

Our victory did not come easily, it was achieved through struggle with imperialism, and with the help and support of the broad masses of the people. Imperialist elements have used all kinds of threats and inducements to obstruct and undermine our reform movement, and even now, they are still obstructing and undermining it. They will never be reconciled to their own failure. As long as they exist for one day, they will not stop their evil acts of undermining our reform movement, undermining our motherland, and harming our Chinese people. Therefore, we must continue to work hard, first of all, to eliminate all imperialist elements, secret agents, spies and all bad elements from our Catholicism. We must make Chinese Catholicism completely sever ties with imperialism.

We have been liberated from the clutches of imperialism, and we now have the freedom to love our country. Any Catholic, as long as he is Chinese, should love China and defend China. We have realized that imperialism, especially American imperialism, is the enemy of our Chinese people, and we should actively participate in all patriotic activities, participate in the great movement to resist America, aid Korea, and love our country, participate in all the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and support our government, abide by all the policies and laws of the government, and respond to all the calls of the government.

We Catholics have been deceived and anesthetized by imperialism for a long time. Although we are now beginning to be aware, there are still many remaining poisons of imperialism in our minds. We must study hard, thoroughly eliminate these remaining poisons in our thinking, improve our political awareness, strengthen our national self-confidence and self-esteem, love our motherland and love our people, actively participate in the country's construction work, and strive to build a free and happy new China.

This is the current task of our patriotic Catholics. As long as we can unite the vast number of Catholics and unite the vast number of people, we will surely continue to win, and our struggle goals will definitely be achieved.
