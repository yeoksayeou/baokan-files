Now I will report to the conference on the development of the independent reform movement of the Catholic Church in Beijing and some ideological issues related to our independent reform movement.

Some people say: Chinese Catholicism is a religion and has nothing to do with imperialism, nor has it been a tool for imperialist aggression against China. There are no imperialist elements in Catholicism.

Is this statement and view factual? We have countless historical facts and evidence to prove that this statement and view are completely untrue. Catholicism is a religion, but after Catholicism entered China, imperialism followed, and imperialism quickly turned Catholicism into a sharp weapon for aggression against China. The large-scale imperialist aggression against China began with the Opium War in 1840, but as early as 1807 to 1830, British missionaries Morrison, German missionaries Gützlaff, and American missionaries Bridgman came to China one after another, selling opium and gathering intelligence. The American missionary Bridgman said, "We who preach in China do so more for political reasons than for religious reasons." American imperialism was the first to openly use religion to invade China. In 1844, the Treaty of Wanghia, which the United States forced China to sign, included "the United States has the right to preach in the five treaty ports." If imperialism did not use religion as a tool for aggression, why would it include the right to preach in a treaty of aggression against China? Preaching is not a national matter, why should it be included in a treaty between countries? In 1858, American Minister William Bradford Reed said in a letter to American Secretary of State Lewis Cass: "I must mention the efforts made by those associated with missionaries and missionary movements, which are very important to the interests of our country (the United States). Without their help, I would simply be unable to fulfill my responsibilities here. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to them for their help and constant valuable advice." Imperialism not only relied on churches and missionaries to scout, gather information, and act as vanguards of aggression, but also used the Chinese people's resistance to the oppression of foreign missionaries as an excuse to launch armed aggression. In 1897, German imperialism occupied Shandong under the pretext of the so-called "Juye Incident." The "Yiwunlu" published by the Shanghai Catholic Church at that time openly stated: "This occupation of Jiaozhou Bay, under the pretext of the murder of missionaries, is in fact a long-planned scheme." The older generation of Catholics in Beijing can still remember the invasion of China by the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, the year of the Boxer Rebellion. At that time, Waldersee, the commander of the Eight-Nation Alliance, clearly stated in his notes the fact that imperialism used Catholicism as a tool for aggression. He said: "Most of the information about the interior was obtained with the help of Catholic priests, and this help came from their willingness. However, Bishop Favier (Bishop of the Xishiku Church in Beijing), a very experienced and intelligent bishop, unfortunately left China for Rome a few days ago. Before leaving, he instructed his representative, Bishop Jarlin, to do his best to help me. Therefore, when Count Yorck advanced to Zhangjiakou, many priests accompanied the army to assist."

Like the facts mentioned above, there are countless examples in the hundred-year history of imperialist aggression against China; it can be said that every action of imperialist aggression against China has the participation of imperialist elements in our Catholicism. Perhaps some people think that this is the history of the past, and the current Catholicism is not like this. This view is also not in accordance with the facts. During the period of Japanese aggression against China and the period when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang ruled China, and even during the Liberation War and after liberation, there are countless facts proving that Catholicism was used by imperialist elements as a tool to invade China and oppose the Chinese people. The major espionage case cracked by the Jizhong Liberated Area People's Government in Zhangjiazhuang, Xian County, in 1947 was committed by Catholic Deputy Bishop Shang Jianxun and four other foreign priests and one Chinese priest. They spied on information, set up private radio stations, provided intelligence to American spies, and lured the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to attack the liberated areas. The armed rebellion organization "Catholic Patriotic Corps" cracked in Shijiazhuang in April 1949 was a counter-revolutionary group organized by a large number of Catholic priests. They gave the US-Chiang planes bombing targets, killing and wounding more than 130 people in Shijiazhuang alone. The case of Catholic Bishop Ford cracked in Meixian County, Guangdong this year, the case of Catholic priest Ge Weide cracked in Gui Sui, and Madi Nuo in the case of Li Andong and others who conspired to armed riots cracked in our Beijing, these imperialist elements in Catholicism either spied on information to supply to Japanese and American aggressors, or hid military supplies and weapons, or participated in the conspiracy of armed riots. A large number of foreign priests were also found with intelligence and military supplies and weapons. These are all facts before our eyes, known to all Catholics and representatives. From these facts, we can see what our Catholicism has been ruined into by these imperialist elements! Based on these criminal facts, can we still say that imperialism has not used our Catholicism as a tool for aggression? Can we still say that there are no imperialist elements in our Catholicism? Can we still say that our Catholicism should not be reformed, should not eliminate these filth, and should not break contact with imperialism?

Some people say: Even if there are these imperialist elements and other bad elements, such as secret agents, traitors, bullies, and hooligans, in Catholicism, they are only personal problems and have nothing to do with our entire Catholicism. Is this view correct? I think this is incorrect, wrong. Since Catholicism is a religion that spreads the truth of God, it will never allow these bad elements to do evil and let them contaminate our religious cause. There is an idiom that says, "A piece of stinking meat spoils the whole pot of soup." We must not allow these bad elements to turn our Catholicism into a group that betrays the motherland and the Chinese people. This is a very clear principle.

Some people also say: Reform is "splitting the church," "destroying the church," and will go to hell, lose the soul, and is "apostasy." This is exactly the nonsense used by those imperialist elements to threaten us and obstruct our participation in the reform movement. From the facts mentioned above, we can see that if Chinese Catholicism is not reformed and the imperialist elements and all evil forces are not eliminated, it will completely become an instrument of imperialist aggression; if we Catholic members do not participate in the reform movement, we will inevitably fall into the clutches of demons and unknowingly become the pawns of imperialism and the sinners of the Chinese nation. This is precisely splitting our Catholicism from China, making our Catholic members betray the Chinese people. This should go to hell, this is losing the soul. How can a Chinese who does not love his country and listens to the dictates of imperialism still be said to have a soul? From beginning to end, our Bible does not have a single sentence prohibiting our believers from loving their motherland. God will never send a patriotic believer to hell; on the contrary, being able to love one's motherland and compatriots is qualified to enter heaven. Those who betray the motherland and listen to the deception and instructions of imperialism should fall into hell, not ascend to heaven, and are truly soulless.

Some people think that Catholics should not speak out about the sins of others and should not accuse the priests who are imperialist elements. Is this view correct? I think it is incorrect, wrong. Like the sinful acts committed by those imperialist elements, what it harms is not only our Catholicism, but also our country and all the people of China. If we do not expose their crimes, then we ourselves are also committing a crime, that is, we agree with them invading China and oppressing the Chinese people. It is entirely appropriate for us to expose their crimes. This is our sacred duty. Does our Catholicism allow people to commit crimes, but not allow others to stop these criminal acts? Does our Catholicism
   Is it a religion that only allows imperialism to invade China, but does not allow the Chinese people to resist aggression? Do imperialist elements have the right to destroy China by taking advantage of Catholicism, and Chinese patriotic Catholics do not have the right to expose their crimes and defend their motherland?

Some people think that we Catholics only believe in God and do not participate in political activities. This idea is exactly the result of being deceived by imperialist elements and falling for their tricks. The many historical facts and cracked counter-revolutionary cases I just mentioned can prove that imperialist elements in Catholicism not only participate in political activities, but also participate in all imperialist aggression activities, including armed aggression. The scum of Catholicism, Yu Bin, was a secret agent and running dog of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang government. Libere, who was just expelled, praised Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and served the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Who can say that they do not participate in political activities? They prohibit us Chinese Catholics from participating in political activities, only one meaning, is not allowed us to love the country, only allowed them to do activities to invade China, not allowed us to participate in activities to love the motherland.

All the above-mentioned incorrect statements and views, although they have existed in the minds of our Catholics, are mainly the result of those imperialist elements deceiving us for a long time. Now we have improved our awareness through study, our eyes have been opened, and nothing can deceive us. With the help of the government and the people of the whole country, we have been liberated from the clutches of imperialism. This is our victory and the victory of the people of the whole of China.

Our victory did not come easily, it was achieved through struggle with imperialism, and with the help and support of the broad masses of the people. Imperialist elements have used all kinds of threats and inducements to obstruct and undermine our reform movement, and even now, they are still obstructing and undermining it. They will never be reconciled to their own failure. As long as they exist for one day, they will not stop their evil acts of undermining our reform movement, undermining our motherland, and harming our Chinese people. Therefore, we must continue to work hard, first of all, to eliminate all imperialist elements, secret agents, spies and all bad elements from our Catholicism. We must make Chinese Catholicism completely sever ties with imperialism.

We have been liberated from the clutches of imperialism, and we now have the freedom to love our country. Any Catholic, as long as he is Chinese, should love China and defend China. We have realized that imperialism, especially American imperialism, is the enemy of our Chinese people, and we should actively participate in all patriotic activities, participate in the great movement to resist America, aid Korea, and love our country, participate in all the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and support our government, abide by all the policies and laws of the government, and respond to all the calls of the government.

We Catholics have been deceived and anesthetized by imperialism for a long time. Although we are now beginning to be aware, there are still many remaining poisons of imperialism in our minds. We must study hard, thoroughly eliminate these remaining poisons in our thinking, improve our political awareness, strengthen our national self-confidence and self-esteem, love our motherland and love our people, actively participate in the country's construction work, and strive to build a free and happy new China.

This is the current task of our patriotic Catholics. As long as we can unite the vast number of Catholics and unite the vast number of people, we will surely continue to win, and our struggle goals will definitely be achieved.

    北京市天主教革新运动中的几个问题
    （北京市天主教各堂革新委员会主任联席会代表张英魁在北京市天主教革新代表会议上的报告摘要）
    我现在要把我们北京市天主教的自立革新运动的发展经过和有关我们自立革新运动的一些思想问题向大会作报告。
    有人说：中国的天主教是宗教，与帝国主义没有关系，也没有做帝国主义侵略中国的工具，天主教中没有什么帝国主义分子。
    这种说法和看法是不是事实呢？我们有数不尽的历史事实和证据来证明这种说法和看法是完全不合事实的。天主教是一个宗教，但是天主教进入中国之后，跟着进来的就是帝国主义，而且帝国主义很快地就把天主教变成侵略中国的一个利器。帝国主义大规模地侵略中国，是从一八四○年鸦片战争开始的，但是远在一八○七年到一八三○年，英国的教士玛利逊、德国的教士郭子立、美国的教士裨治文等人就陆续来到中国，一面贩卖鸦片，一面刺探情报。美国的传教士裨治文说过这样的话：“我等在中国传教之人，与其说是由于宗教的原因，毋宁说是由于政治的原因。”美帝国主义是第一个公开利用宗教来侵略中国的。一八四四年美国强迫中国订立的望厦条约，就写上“美国在通商五口有传教权”。试想帝国主义如果不利用宗教作为侵略的工具，为什么要把传教的权利订在侵略中国的条约上呢？传教并不是国家的事，为什么要订在国与国之间的条约中呢？一八五八年美国公使列卫廉在一封给美国国务卿盖斯的信中说过这样的话：“我必须提及传教士与传教运动那些有关系的人，他们所作的努力，对于我国（美国）的利益，是非常重要的，没有他们的帮助，我在这里就简直无法履行我的责任。为了他们的帮助和经常的可贵的忠告，我愿意乘此机会向他们表示谢意。”帝国主义侵略中国不仅依靠教会和教士来打前站、探消息、作侵略先锋，而且也利用中国人民反抗外国传教士的压迫，作为发动武装侵略的藉口。一八九七年德帝国主义假借所谓“巨野教案”侵占我国的山东。当时上海天主堂所出版的“益闻录”就公然这样说：“此次占据胶澳，借端于教士被戕一事，实则深谋远虑积有日矣。”我们北京市年长一辈的教友，还能记得一九○○年，即庚子年的八国联军侵略中国之役。当时八国联军的统帅瓦德西在他的笔记中，就把帝国主义利用天主教作侵略工具的事实，说得明明白白。他说：“所有内地消息之探知，余多赖天主教神甫之助，而且此种帮助，系出自彼等情愿，惟其中极为老练聪明之主教樊国梁（Farier 北京西什库教堂主教），不幸已于数日以前，前往罗马，离开中国。临行之时，曾训令彼之代表加林（Jarlin）主教务须尽力助余。因此，约克（Yorck）伯爵进兵张家口之时，曾有许多神甫随营效力相助。”
    像前面所说的这些事实，在一百年来帝国主义侵略中国的历史中，是举不胜举的；可以说帝国主义侵略中国的每一个行动，都有我们天主教中的帝国主义分子参加。也许有人以为这是过去的历史，现在的天主教就不是这样了，这种看法也同样不合事实。在日本侵略中国的时期和蒋介石匪帮统治中国的时期，而且就在解放战争当中和解放之后的现在，也有无数的事实，证明天主教被帝国主义分子用来作侵略中国和反对中国人民的工具。一九四七年冀中解放区人民政府在献县张家庄破获的大间谍案，就是天主教副主教尚建勋和其他四个外国神甫、一个中国神甫所作的。他们刺探情报、私设电台，以情报供给美国间谍，勾引蒋介石匪军进攻解放区。一九四九年四月在石家庄破获的武装暴动组织“公教报国团”，就是一大批天主教神甫所组织的反革命团体，他们给美蒋飞机指示轰炸目标，仅仅在石家庄一地，即炸死炸伤人民一百三十多人。今年在广东梅县破获的天主堂主教福尔德案，在归绥破获的天主堂司铎葛维德案，在我们北京破获的李安东等阴谋武装暴动案中的马迪懦，这批天主教中的帝国主义分子，不是刺探情报供给日本和美国侵略者，就是隐藏军火武器、参加武装暴动的阴谋。还有一大批外国籍的神甫，也被搜出情报和军火武器，这都是摆在我们眼前的事实，是各位教友、各位代表所知道的。从这些事实可以看出，我们天主教已经被这些帝国主义分子糟踏成什么样子了！根据这些罪恶的事实，我们还能说帝国主义没有把我们天主教当作侵略的工具吗？我们还能说我们天主教中没有帝国主义分子吗？我们还能说我们天主教不应该革新、不应该扫除这些污秽、不应该与帝国主义切断联系吗？
    有人说：天主教中即使有这些帝国主义分子和其他的坏分子，如特务、汉奸、恶霸、流氓，也只是他们个人问题，和我们整个天主教不发生关系。这种看法对不对呢？我以为这是不对的，错误的。因为天主教既然是一个宗教，是传播天主的道理的，就决不允许有这些坏分子来作恶，让他们来沾污我们的宗教事业。有一句成语说：“一块臭肉坏了满锅汤。”我们决不能允许这些坏分子把我们的天主教弄成背叛祖国、背叛中国人民的团体，这是很明白的道理。
    又有人说：革新就是“裂教”、“灭教”，就要下地狱，就要丧失灵魂，就是“叛教”。这正是那些帝国主义分子用来威胁我们、阻挠我们参加革新运动的胡说。从前面所说的事实，我们可以看出，如果中国的天主教不革新，不清除帝国主义分子和一切恶势力，就将完全成为帝国主义的侵略工具；我们天主教教友如果不参加革新运动，也难免不堕入魔手，不知不觉成为帝国主义的爪牙、中国民族的罪人。这才正是把我们天主教从中国分裂出去，使我们天主教教友背叛中国人民，这才应该下地狱，这正是丧失灵魂。一个中国人不爱自己的国家，听信帝国主义的支配，难道还能说他是有灵魂的吗？我们的圣经从头到尾没有一句是禁止我们教徒爱自己祖国的，天主决不会把一个爱国的信徒降入地狱；相反的，能够爱自己的祖国和同胞，才有资格进入天堂，那些背叛祖国听信帝国主义的欺骗、指示的人，才应该堕入地狱，不得升入天堂，才真正是没有灵魂的。
    有人以为天主教徒是不应该讲出别人的罪恶，不应该控诉作为帝国主义分子的神甫的。这种看法对不对呢？我以为是不对的，是错误的。像那些帝国主义分子所作的罪恶行为，它所危害的不仅仅是我们天主教，而且是我们的国家、我们全中国的人民。我们如果不揭发他们的罪行，那就是我们自己也犯了罪，那就是我们同意他们侵略中国、压迫中国人民。我们揭发他们的罪行，是完全应该的，这是我们的天职。我们天主教难道是允许人们犯罪，却不允许别人阻止这些犯罪行为的吗？我们的天主教难道是
    一个只准许帝国主义侵略中国，而不允许中国人民反抗侵略的宗教吗？帝国主义分子难道有权利假借天主教胡作非为来破坏中国，而中国的爱国教友就没有权利揭发他们的罪行、保卫自己的祖国吗？
    有人以为我们天主教徒只是信仰天主，是不参加政治活动的。这种想法正是受了帝国主义分子的欺骗，上了他们的当。我刚才讲过的许多历史事实和破获的反革命案件，都可以证明天主教中的帝国主义分子，不仅参加政治活动，而且参加一切帝国主义的侵略行动，包括武装侵略在内。天主教中的败类于斌就是蒋介石匪帮政府的特务走狗，刚被驱逐的黎培里曾经颂扬过蒋介石匪徒，而且替蒋介石匪帮服务。谁能说他们是不参加政治活动的呢？他们禁止我们中国教友参加政治活动，只有一个意义，就是不许我们爱国，只许他们做侵略中国的活动，不许我们参加爱祖国的活动。
    所有上面这些错误的说法和看法，虽然在我们教友的思想中存在过，但这主要是由于那些帝国主义分子长期欺骗我们的结果。现在我们经过学习，觉悟提高了，眼睛睁开了，什么也不能欺骗我们了。我们在政府和全国人民的帮助之下，从帝国主义魔爪中解放出来了，这是我们的胜利，也是全中国人民的胜利。
    我们的胜利不是轻易得来的，是经过与帝国主义作斗争，而且是得到广大人民的帮助、支持，才得到的。帝国主义分子曾经使用一切的威胁利诱手段来阻挠与破坏我们的革新运动，直在现在，他们还在阻挠与破坏。他们对于他们自己的失败是决不会甘心的，只要他们还存在一天，就不会停止他们破坏我们革新运动、破坏我们祖国和危害我们中国人民的罪恶行为。因此，我们必须继续努力，首先是从我们天主教中清除一切帝国主义分子、特务、间谍和一切坏分子，我们必须使中国的天主教与帝国主义完全断绝关系。
    我们已经从帝国主义的魔爪下解放出来了，我们现在有了爱国的自由。任何一个天主教徒，只要他是中国人，就应该爱护中国、保卫中国。我们已经认识到帝国主义、尤其是美帝国主义，是我们中国人民的敌人，就应该积极地参加一切爱国活动，参加伟大的抗美援朝爱国运动，参加抗美援朝的一切工作，并且拥护我们的政府，遵守政府的一切政策法令和响应政府的一切号召。
    我们天主教教友是受过帝国主义的长期欺骗与麻醉的，我们现在虽然开始觉悟了，但是我们的思想上还残存着帝国主义不少的余毒，我们必须好好地学习，澈底扫清这些思想的余毒，提高我们的政治觉悟，加强我们的民族自信心、自尊心、热爱祖国、热爱人民，积极参加国家的建设工作，为建设自由、幸福的新中国而奋斗。
    这就是我们爱国的天主教教友当前的任务。只要我们能团结广大的教友、团结广大的人民，我们一定会继续胜利，我们的奋斗目标是一定能够达到的。
