Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

The "Hebei Education" Society and the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Education

Review of Errors in the Article "What Ethnic Minorities Does China Have?"

(I) Review by the "Hebei Education" Society

The People's Daily pointed out a severely flawed article, "What Ethnic Minorities Does China Have?" in the book review section on June 17th, which appeared in the fourth volume, third issue of "Chahar Education." The "Cultural Life" column on July 8th also published a review by the "Chahar Education" Society. This erroneous short article originally appeared in our "Hebei Education," so we bear even greater responsibility.

"Hebei Education" was founded in October 1949 and adopted the aforementioned short article from the "Mass Knowledge" column on the second page of the "Worker's Daily" on September 12th of the same year as filler material. Although we were significantly lacking in knowledge about ethnic minorities, many derogatory and discriminatory names had already been corrected in numerous documents. Yet, this article still used them. We should have recognized its errors and refrained from using it. Instead, we blindly trusted the Worker's Daily and reprinted it as is, causing the error to spread and circulate. To call it carelessness is too lenient. This is truly a disregard for our minority brothers and sisters, and a serious political error. After the first issue was published, the Geography Teaching and Research Group of Xingtai Normal School sent a letter with suggestions for corrections, which drew our attention. For the sake of caution, we sent this letter to North China University at the time, asking them to review it. The Geography Research Group of North China University also provided a detailed response, with many corrections to the opinions of the Geography Teaching and Research Group of Xingtai Normal School. By this point, we were deeply aware of the complexity of the issue and did not dare to consider the letter from North China University as a definitive conclusion. Therefore, we did not publish it, intending to wait for the future, and have shelved it ever since. The error in the original article was confirmed. Even if the two correction documents could not be immediately taken as definitive conclusions, they would at least stop the spread of the original error and spark discussion, so that correct information and explanations could be obtained. We did not actively seek a solution, but instead used the method of shelving it to wait. This not only failed the concern of the two research groups of Xingtai Normal School and North China University, but also illustrates our lack of a sense of responsibility to the broad masses of readers, and especially an unforgivable crime against ethnic minorities. The basic reason for this is that we lack a political sense of responsibility, our political and ideological level is too low, and we have not properly understood the ethnic policy. "Hebei Education" should strengthen its political and ideological content in the future, which is a matter currently under consideration. In addition to redoubling our efforts in political and professional studies, we should also improve our review of manuscripts and our work systems.

(II) Review by the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Education

"Hebei Education" is a guiding publication for cultural and educational work in our province and is extremely important, a point we often mention in our work. But in reality, our emphasis has been far from sufficient. Our ideological leadership has been inadequate, our political thought has been paralyzed, and we lack a strict manuscript review system. We rarely paid attention to the filler short articles in the publication. This is the main reason for the errors made by "Hebei Education." In the future, we must learn from the past, strengthen our leadership over departmental publications, especially improving ideological and political leadership and strictly reviewing manuscripts. In accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on rectifying various publications, we will earnestly improve our leadership over publications.

Review Regarding the Factory's Wheat Receiving Issues

After reading the criticisms in the July 30th People's Daily regarding the problems encountered by farmers in the Beijing suburbs during the factory's receipt of summer grain, we immediately convened all employees to seriously study and conduct a review:

1.  First, we felt that our preparations for receiving wheat were far behind the surge in enthusiasm of the masses to deliver grain and the rapid passage of time. Based on last year's experience, the masses took a long time to deliver wheat, and we did not feel any difficulties or other problems in our work. But we failed to recognize that the political awareness of the farmers has been generally enhanced in the movement to resist America and aid Korea this year. We originally expected to start receiving wheat on July 10th, but some villages delivered it as early as July 4th. Although we urgently purchased wheat-holding tools and mobilized and organized employees after arranging the summer grain requisition, we were caught off guard by the large quantity and small space, which caused dissatisfaction among the farmers. This is the result of dealing with today's new situation and new problems with old experiences, and we committed the mistake of narrow empiricism. 2. When problems arose, we did not devise ways to change our working methods in a timely and effective manner based on the actual situation, but continued to cope with the original plan. The farmers had already suffered hardships by rushing over day and night and deserved encouragement. But we insisted on opening the scales at 6:30 a.m., which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. When Village Chief Qi Bingwu had a dispute with the cadre stationed at the factory from the 13th District over unloading wheat, we did not resolve the issue, but stood by and did nothing, lacking a spirit of actively taking responsibility for our work. Through this study, we realized that this was a manifestation of a lack of a mass perspective and disregard for the suffering of the farmers, which must be corrected urgently.

Due to the above errors, we produced the bad consequences of wasting time and troubling the people, causing a bad influence among the masses. Through this work inspection, we are willing to sincerely accept the criticism. In addition to remembering the lessons learned and improving our work, we offer our apologies to the grain-transporting farmers and village cadres.		Beijing New Flour Mill No. 2

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    “河北教育”社暨河北省文教厅
    对“中国有那些少数民族”一文错误的检讨
   （一）“河北教育”社的检讨
    人民日报在六月十七日的图书评论里指出了“察哈尔教育”四卷三期的一篇有严重错误的文章——“中国有那些少数民族”，七月八日“文化生活”栏又发表了“察哈尔教育”社的检讨。这一错误的短文原来是载在我们“河北教育”上的，因此我们更要负责。
        “河北教育”创刊于一九四九年十月，采用了同年九月十二日“工人日报”第二版大众知识栏里的上述短文作为补白。我们虽然相当缺乏关于少数民族的知识，但许多污蔑歧视少数民族的名称是早在不少文件中已被纠正了的，此文仍然沿用，便应该确认其有错误而不予采用，乃竟盲目地信赖工人日报，照样转载，使错误散布、流传。说是粗心大意，未免太自恕了，这实在是对少数兄弟民族的忽视，犯了严重的政治错误。创刊号发出之后，邢台师范地理教学研究小组就曾来信提出补正意见，这才引起注意；为慎重起见，曾把这封信寄给当时的华北大学，请他们审阅。华北大学地理研究组也曾详作答复，对邢台师范地理教学研究组的意见，又有不少补正。到这时，我们已深感这一问题的复杂，对华北大学的来信也未敢遽认为定论，因而不曾予以发表，意将有待于将来，就一直搁置到现在。原件的错误是肯定了的，两个补正文件即使不能遽作定论，至少也会停止原件错误的散播，引起大家的讨论，那末，正确的资料和解说是可以得到的。我们不积极地寻求解决，而用搁置的办法来等待。这不仅辜负了邢台师范和华北大学两个研究组的关怀，更说明了我们对广大读者的缺乏责任心，对少数民族尤其是不可宽恕的罪过。其所以致此的基本原因，乃是由于我们的政治责任感太缺乏，政治思想水平太低，没有很好地领会民族政策。“河北教育”今后应加强政治性和思想性，已是当前正在考虑的问题。我们除了百倍努力于政治学习业务学习之外，更当在审改稿件上和工作制度上有所改进。
    （二）河北省文教厅的检讨
    “河北教育”是我省文教工作方面的指导刊物，本极重要，我们也常在工作中提到这一点。但实际上我们的重视是十分不足的，思想领导不够，政治思想麻痹，又缺乏严格审稿制度，对刊物中补白性的短文很少注意审查；这是“河北教育”犯错误的主要原因。今后我们一定接受过去的教训，加强对机关刊物的领导，特别是提高思想政治领导，严格审稿工作；根据中央关于整顿各种出版刊物的指示的精神，认真地改进我们对刊物的领导工作。
    北京市新建面粉二厂
    关于该厂收麦问题的检讨
    读七月三十日报载北京市郊区农民对本厂接受夏征小麦所发生问题的批评后，当即召集厂内员工认真学习，并进行检讨：
    一、首先，我们感到收麦的准备工作，远赶不上群众踊跃交粮情绪的高涨及时间的迅速。根据去年的经验：群众交麦时间较长，在工作上倒没感到有什么困难和发生其他问题；但没认识到今年的农民群众在抗美援朝运动中政治认识的普遍提高。原预计七月十日才可开始收麦，结果有的村七月四日就送来了。虽然在布置夏征工作后，急购盛麦工具，动员组织员工，但因数量多，地址小，一拥而来，措手不及，致使农民不满。这是以过去旧经验，处理今天新情况下的新问题的结果，犯了狭隘经验主义的毛病。二、问题发生了，我们还没有根据实际情况，及时、有效地设法改变工作方法，而仍是抱着原计划来应付。本来，农民星夜赶来，已颇受劳苦，理该得到鼓励；而我们却坚持早六点半开秤，招致群众不满。村长齐丙武因卸麦与十三区驻厂干部发生争议时，我们也没有解决了这个问题，束手旁观，缺乏对工作积极负责的精神。经过这次学习，认识了这是缺乏群众观点、漠视农民疾苦的表现，亟应纠正。
    由于以上的错误，产生了误时、劳民的恶果，造成了群众中的不良影响。经此次工作检查，愿意诚恳地接受批评。除记取教训、改进工作外，并向运粮的农民及村干部致歉意。		北京新建面粉二厂
