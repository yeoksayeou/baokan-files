Reader's Letter

To the Editorial Staff of the Shanghai News Daily:

Shanghai has been liberated for more than two years, and the progress in all aspects has been astonishing. However, the advertisements for operas and films in Shanghai newspapers are still vulgar and lack ideological content, which has a very bad influence on the masses. For example, the advertisements in the Shanghai News Daily on August 31, 1951, included "Blood and Tears of Hatred," a Hong Kong production starring "big star" Li Lihua. The advertisement featured a "glamorous" woman with "jewelry and expressive eyes" from the "Hong Kong school," and the film's content was described as "blood debts piling up like mountains, hatred as deep as the sea." Another advertisement was for the Cantonese opera "A Notorious Reputation Earned in Brothels," a "Master Ma's literary masterpiece." There was also the slapstick comedy "Little Taoist Arrives in Shanghai" with "tens of thousands of jokes and overwhelming gags." The content of such film and theater advertisements should be quickly improved.

Editor's Note: Paying attention to the ideological nature and seriousness of film and theater advertisements and descriptions is one of the important tasks of advertising departments of newspapers, theaters, and film distribution organizations in various regions. The letter "Film Advertisements Should Be Serious" from reader Dong Juxian published in the "People's Literature and Art" weekly of this newspaper on March 11th, offered some specific opinions on this issue. The opinions of comrades Chen Bingkun and Deng Su, published in today's newspaper, are also worthy of attention.

    上海新闻日报应改善影剧广告编辑同志：
    上海解放已经两年多了，两年多来各方面的进步是可惊的。但是上海报纸的戏曲、电影广告还是很庸俗、缺乏思想性，给群众很坏的影响。如一九五一年八月三十一日上海新闻日报上的广告，有香港出品、“大明星”李丽华主演的“血泪仇”。广告上出现的是一个“珠光宝气，眉目传情”的“港派”艳妇，影片内容说是“血债积如山、仇恨深似海”。另外有粤剧“马派文艺名剧”“赢得青楼薄幸名”。还有“笑料成千成万，噱头排山倒海”的滑稽剧“小道士到上海”等。这样的影剧广告内容，是应该迅速改善的。

    编者按：注意影剧广告和说明内容的思想性、严肃性，是各地报纸广告部门和影剧院以及影片发行机关的重要任务之一。三月十一日本报“人民文艺”周刊登载的读者董聚贤同志的来信“电影广告应当严肃”，曾对这个问题提过一些具体的意见，今日本报刊载的读者陈炳堃、邓速两同志的意见都是值得重视的。
