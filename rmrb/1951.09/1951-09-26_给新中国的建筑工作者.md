    To the Construction Workers of New China
    Senior Technician and Engineer of the Excavating Machine Team at the Volga-Don Canal Construction Project in the Soviet Union
    Xie Ming·Pulekhanov
    Dear Comrades:
    My friends and I, who are working on the Volga-Don Canal construction project, extend our heartfelt congratulations to you and wish you new achievements in your labor for the happiness of the glorious Chinese people.
    All the people of the Soviet Union and all honest people in the world are celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China with you. Humanity will never forget this day, because on October 1, 1949, our planet became brighter and more joyful. On this day, the great, free Chinese people, under the leadership of their heroic Communist Party and wise leader Mao Zedong, stood shoulder to shoulder with the powerful Soviet people who are fighting for peace and building communism.
    Dear friends, we are greeting your great festival by safeguarding peace in the spirit of Stakhanov. The architects of the Volga-Don Navigation Canal, like all the people of the Soviet Union, are striving to increase the wealth of the motherland and consolidate the power of the Soviet state, which defends world peace, through their outstanding work.
    I am writing this letter to you after the end of today's work.
    Today, our team excavated 5,000 cubic meters of soil from the riverbed. There are a total of five people in our team. That is to say, each person excavated 1,000 cubic meters of soil. And our excavator team, consisting of seventeen people, will complete 2 million cubic meters of earthwork on the canal project this year. The state has entrusted us with such powerful technology. Dear friends, I firmly believe that in the near future, you will have the same technology. Because we have seen that the national economy and culture of the People's Republic of China are developing rapidly. We are sincerely happy. The young industry of free China will quickly equip its builders with walking excavators, powerful cranes, and other sophisticated machines that can replace the labor of thousands of people. Soviet engineers and workers are willing to help you realize this wish as soon as possible.
    We are building the Volga-Don Navigation Canal, linking the five seas of the Soviet Union into a transportation system, and irrigating 2.75 million hectares of arid land. The construction of the canal will be completed two years ahead of schedule. This project has become possible thanks to the tenacious labor of the Soviet people and the rapid development of our technology.
    In the spring of 1952, ships will sail along the Volga-Don Canal. By that time, we will be working on new great construction projects. Perhaps we will be opening up canals to the desert, or we will be engaged in the construction of powerful hydroelectric power stations. In our great motherland, there are many buildings, and the labor of their builders is respected by the vast people. We rejoice in this because our labor increases the wealth of the people, makes the lives of the Soviet people happier, and consolidates world peace.
    I believe that the joy of constructive labor will appear in the hearts of the builders of hydraulic engineering projects on the Yellow River, the Huai River, and other rivers. The workers in cities and villages all over China, building new factories and houses, new clubs and kindergartens, will similarly feel this joy of free labor for the happiness of their motherland.
    We are peaceful people, engaged in peaceful work. We want to cultivate forests in the desert, connect the Hai Rivers, and cultivate fruitful harvests in the fields and gardens. However, we who are engaged in peaceful work are keenly watching the war conspiracies of the British and American imperialists who are aggressing against Korea, thereby threatening the security of the great China and the Soviet Union. But no matter how vicious the ambitious people who crave world hegemony are, they will eventually fail. The heroic Korean people, with the assistance of the staunch Chinese People's Volunteers, will drive the invaders out of their land. The forces fighting for peace are growing and consolidating.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Glory belongs to the great Chinese people, their heroic Communist Party, and their wise leader Mao Zedong!
    Long live Comrade Stalin, the great leader of all working people and the standard-bearer of peace! (Attached picture)

    给新中国的建筑工作者
    苏联伏尔加河——顿河运河建筑大走动掘凿机技师长、工程师
    谢明·普列哈诺夫亲爱的同志们：
    我和在伏尔加河——顿河运河建筑工程中工作的朋友们，衷心地祝贺你们，并希望你们在为光荣的中国人民的幸福的劳动中，获得新的成就。
    全体苏联人民和世界上一切正直的人们，都和你们一起庆祝中华人民共和国成立的节日。人类永不会忘记这个日子，因为一九四九年十月一日在我们星球上变得更灿烂了、更愉快了。在这一天，伟大的自由的中国人民，在自己的英勇的共产党和英明的领袖毛泽东领导下，和为和平而战斗并建设着共产主义的强大的苏联人民并肩地站起来了。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们以斯塔哈诺夫的精神守卫和平，来迎接你们的伟大节日。伏尔加河——顿河通航运河的建筑师们，也像全苏联人民一样，尽力以自己卓越的工作增加祖国的财富，巩固守卫全世界和平的苏维埃国家的威力。
    我给你们写这封信，是在今天的工作结束以后。
    今天，我们一班从河床中掘出了五千立方米的泥土。我们这一班总共有五个人。这就是说，每一个人挖出了一千立方米泥土。而由十七个人组成的我们的掘凿机全队，今年在运河工程上将完成二百万立方米的土工。国家把这样有力的技术交给了我们。亲爱的朋友们，我坚定不移地相信，在不久的未来，你们将会有同样的技术。因为我们看到了中华人民共和国的国民经济和文化正在飞速地发展着。我们衷心地高兴。自由中国的年青的工业，将以走动掘凿机、强有力的起重机和其他能够代替千人劳动的完善的机械，把自己的建筑者迅速地装备起来。苏联的工程师和工人愿意帮助你们尽快地实现这个愿望。
    我们正在建筑着伏尔加河——顿河航行运河，把苏联的五个海联结成一个运输系统，而且能够灌溉干旱的二百七十五万公顷土地。运河的建筑工程比原定时期要提前两年完成。依靠苏联人民的顽强的劳动和我们技术的迅速发展，这项工程已经成为可能。
    一九五二年春天，船只将会沿着伏尔加河——顿河运河航行。到这个时候，我们将会为新的伟大的建筑工程工作。也许，我们将要把运河开拓到沙漠去，或者我们将会从事强有力的水力发电站工程的建筑。在我们伟大的祖国里，有许多建筑物，它的建筑者的劳动被广大人民所尊敬。我们的劳动增加人民的财富，使苏联人民的生活更幸福，使全世界的和平更巩固，我们以此而欢欣。
    我相信，建设性劳动的愉快会出现在黄河、淮河和其他河流建设水力工程的建筑者的心中。工人们在全中国的城市和乡村里，建筑新的工厂和房屋，新的俱乐部和幼稚园，他们同样地会感觉到这种为自己祖国幸福的自由劳动的愉快。
    我们是和平的人们，从事和平的工作。我们要在沙漠上培植起森林，把海河联结在一起，在田野上和花园里培植出丰硕的收获。但是，从事和平工作的我们，锐敏地注视着侵略朝鲜从而威胁着伟大的中国和苏联安全的美英帝国主义分子的战争阴谋。但是，渴望世界霸权的野心家无论怎样狠毒，他们终会失败的。英勇的朝鲜人民在刚毅的中国志愿军的协助下，会把侵略者从自己的土地上清除出去的。争取和平的斗争力量在增长着和巩固着。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    光荣属于伟大的中国人民、他的英勇的共产党及其英明的领袖毛泽东！
    全体劳动人民的伟大领袖、和平的旗手斯大林同志万岁！（附图片）
