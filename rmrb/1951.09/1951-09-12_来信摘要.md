Letter to the Editor Summaries

    Writing Official Documents Should Focus on Popularization
    Government documents are an important tool for conveying policies and laws. Since liberation, great progress has been made in popularizing official documents. For example, the "Eight Rules of Agreement" posted everywhere at the beginning of liberation were easily understood by the common people and had a great effect.

    However, recently we have seen some documents that use many classical Chinese words and terms like "顷奉" (qǐng fèng - "recently received"), "等因" (děng yīn - "and so on"), and "仰即" (yǎng jí - "you should immediately") from the "official document format." Not only are these documents incomprehensible to many ordinary people, but even cadres with lower levels of education find them difficult to understand. I believe that if this phenomenon continues to develop, it will affect the connection between the government and the masses. I suggest that governments at all levels educate the personnel responsible for drafting official documents, and strive to make the writing of official documents popular and easy for everyone to understand.

    Revolutionary Martyrs Monument Should Be Respected
    I often go to Tiananmen Square. Seeing the Revolutionary Martyrs Monument in the square, I feel infinite admiration for the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the cause of the people's revolution. However, I often see many people casually sitting and playing on the base of the Revolutionary Martyrs Monument. I think this is very wrong and shows disrespect for the martyrs. We built the Revolutionary Martyrs Monument to commemorate the heroic deeds of the revolutionary martyrs; we should all respect and cherish the Martyrs Monument. I hope everyone will consciously pay attention to this, and the relevant authorities should stop any behavior that disrespects the Martyrs Monument.

    来信摘要
    写公文应注意通俗化
    政府的文件是传达政策法令的一种重要工具。解放以来，公文通俗化有了很大成绩。如初解放时，各处张贴的“约法八章”，老百姓很容易看懂，效果很大。
    但是，最近我们又看到有些文件，用了很多文言的词句和“公文程式”中的“顷奉”、“等因”、“仰即”等字眼。这些文件，不但很多老百姓看不懂，就是文化程度较低的干部也不容易看懂。我认为，这种现象如果发展下去，就会影响政府和群众的联系。我建议各级政府对负责公文起草的人员进行教育，写公文时要尽量做到通俗化，使大家容易看懂。

    应该尊敬革命烈士纪念碑
    我经常到天安门广场去。看到广场上的革命烈士纪念碑，我对为人民革命事业而牺牲的烈士们感到无限崇敬。但是，我又常常看到有许多人随便坐在革命烈士纪念碑的碑基上玩闹。我认为，这是非常不对的，是不尊敬烈士的表现。我们建立革命烈士纪念碑，是为了纪念革命烈士们的英勇业迹；我们大家就应该尊敬和爱护烈士纪念碑。希望大家自觉地注意这一点，有关机关并应对不尊重烈士纪念碑的行为加以制止。
