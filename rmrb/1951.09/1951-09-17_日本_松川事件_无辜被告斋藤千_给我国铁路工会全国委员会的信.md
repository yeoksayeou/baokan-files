Editor's Note: On December 6, 1950, the Fukushima District Court, under the rule of the Yoshida reactionary government, the running dogs of American imperialism in Japan, illegally sentenced 20 members of the Japanese Communist Party and patriotic workers to prison terms under the pretext of the so-called "Matsukawa Train Derailment Incident" that occurred on August 17, 1949. This verdict by the Yoshida reactionary government is a criminal act that violates the Potsdam Proclamation and seriously endangers the basic rights of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people; it is a shameful means by the American and Japanese reactionaries to maintain their precarious rule in Japan and suppress democratic forces in Japan. The following letter is from Saito Sen, an innocent victim of the "Matsukawa Incident," to Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Railway Workers' Union of China. From this letter, one can fully see the great spirit of the members of the Japanese Communist Party and the working class and their infinite confidence in the final victory. The second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" will be held on October 23 this year. Saito Sen and his comrades express their determination to fight resolutely for victory. They have the support of the Japanese working class, the broad masses of Japanese patriotic people, and peace-loving people all over the world. They will severely strike at the conspiracy of the American and Japanese reactionaries to turn Japan into a military base and colony.

To Comrade Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Railway Workers' Union of China:

On January 25, 1951, at the Miyagi Prison, we saw the telegram of encouragement sent by your committee to the United Committee of the Japan National Railway (hereinafter referred to as "JNR") Union and forwarded to the 20 of us. We were deeply grateful and excited to receive such strong support and encouragement from you while in the dark and cold prison. In particular, your encouragement and help to us ten JNR workers made us feel very happy, close, and warm.

As is well known, this train derailment incident (i.e., the "Matsukawa Incident") is a major political conspiracy by the American and Japanese reactionaries in implementing their anti-people and anti-communist policies. In summary, this incident, which occurred at 3:10 a.m. on August 17, 1949, can be judged to have the following purposes:

\t1. The American and Japanese reactionaries created the Shimoyama and Mitaka incidents in an attempt to force the implementation of staff reductions in the national railways based on the "Fixed Number Law" (referring to the reactionary legislation that forces a fixed number of employees within state-owned enterprises, established in May 1949) and to undermine the unity of the workers. However, after the staff reductions, Communist Party members and progressive workers remained at their posts, rebuilt new organizations, and opposed the intensification of labor, thus gradually uniting with the entire people to launch struggles. The effect of the staff reductions was very small. Under the circumstances at the time, this conspiracy by the traitor Yoshida was also a necessary means to force the implementation of staff reductions in the postal and telecommunications unions.

\t2. The Fukushima Branch of the National Railway Union stood at the forefront of the struggle against staff reductions and to defend the national railways, especially actively opposing the investment of "U.S. Aid Counterpart Funds," which gradually invaded the JNR from 1949. As is well known, if the railways are subjected to the control of foreign capital, it means that a country's industry, economy, and the politics based on them will also be manipulated by foreign capital, and thus the country will become a colony or semi-colony of foreign capital. This is a typical feature of the era of imperialism. Therefore, we fought under the slogan of "Opposing the ‘Manchukuo-ization’ of the JNR" (referring to the railways occupied by Japanese imperialism in South Manchuria before the war).

Because of the Fukushima Management Department Incident on July 4, 1949 (Note: To oppose staff reductions, about 1,000 members of the JNR Union collectively negotiated with the head of the Fukushima Management Department on the night of July 4, but due to the order of U.S. occupation army Lieutenant Colonel Shagner, about 300 policemen from Fukushima City came to suppress them, forcing the negotiations to end. At that time, we lined up neatly, led by the union flag, and withdrew singing the Internationale. For this reason, Suzuki Shin, Takeda Hisashi, Okada Yoshimatsu, and I were arrested and prosecuted, but never brought to public trial) and the uncovering of the unreasonable incident at Ida Station on July 7 (According to the resolutions of the National Union Congress in April and the branch congress in May, the task was to uncover the unreasonable behavior of railway cadres, because democratizing and clarifying job positions was the central task of the struggle at the time. I, along with about 20 workers, went to Ida Station to investigate the truth of the unreasonable behavior and the oppression of union members and unreasonable staff reductions by station cadres, and in order to eliminate these phenomena, we concluded a contract with the station cadres, thus incurring a search by the CIC—i.e., the U.S. military intelligence department. I was arrested on July 13. After a week-long hunger strike, I was released on bail in August and prosecuted. Among these 20 people, Akama Katsumi, who was considered one of the parties involved in the Matsukawa Incident, was also prosecuted, but the public trial has not yet begun), almost all the cadres of the Fukushima Union branch were arrested and imprisoned.

To go back a little further:

On June 30, 1949, the "Taira Incident" occurred (the incident in which armed police officers suppressed mine workers in Taira City who were defending the Communist Party wall newspaper, and 150 defendants persisted in the struggle during the public trial). In connection with this, in Fukushima City, there was the Red Flag Incident of the Prefectural Government (on June 30, workers and citizens held a parade near the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly to oppose staff reductions and demand the protection of national industry and the sale of grain on credit. Inside the Prefectural Assembly, workers from the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Factory of the Japan National Railway raised the red flag and the union flag for the first time. This arrest incident also became the beginning of the Matsukawa Incident. The workers from the Matsukawa Factory Union of the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Factory of the Japan National Railway who participated in this parade all became defendants in the "Matsukawa" Incident). In Koriyama City, there was the Koriyama City Hall Parade Incident (To protest the suppression incident in Taira City, workers, centered on JNR workers in Koriyama City, protested to the city hall, which became the beginning of the Matsukawa Incident. After the first trial, eight of the ten people illegally arrested were convicted but given suspended sentences, and two were acquitted). In Wakamatsu City, there was the Hirota Steel Incident (Comrade Yamaguchi, the chairman of the Mitsubishi Hirota Steel Union, engaged in collective negotiations to oppose the factory's staff reductions and concluded a "no staff reduction" contract with the factory manager, but was later forced to abandon it by the military government. To demand the release of Chairman Yamaguchi, who was detained in the Wakamatsu Police Station, workers, centered on Japan National Railway workers, held a demonstration). For these organized provocation and suppression incidents jointly directed by the American and Japanese reactionaries and planned and executed by the Fukushima Prefectural Police Station, the Fukushima Branch of the National Railway Union, on the one hand, fully refuted them, and on the other hand, attacked the enemy's weaknesses, and carried out struggles against foreign capital invasion and staff reductions, to defend the national railways, to "oppose the 'Manchukuo-ization' of the JNR," and to expose unreasonable incidents.

The central goal of all these struggles was to "fully implement the Potsdam Proclamation," to achieve "national independence," "comprehensive peace," and "opposition to military bases."

In prison, we (Takeda Hisashi, Okada Yoshimatsu, Akama Katsumi, and myself at Fukushima Prison) conducted hunger strikes for a week to ten days to oppose unreasonable suppression and arrests. As a result of the struggle, on August 3, 1949, Takeda, Okada, and I were released on bail for 10,000 yen each, and Akama was released on August 1 with a bail of 10,000 yen paid by the Fukushima Branch of the National Railway Union (this money was related to the "Matsukawa Incident" because during the trial, the prosecutors and traitorous judges insisted that Akama had done the work of derailing the train).

On August 6 and 7, at the Fukushima Branch Congress of the National Railway Union held in Koriyama City, the democratization alliance members (a group of right-wing social democrats, referred to as "Mindo"), who advocated driving out the laid-off union members, and the unity faction, who opposed this proposal, engaged in fierce debates. The final result was that conscientious union members withdrew from the meeting and continued to fight against the violence of "Mindo."

In this way, the Fukushima Branch of the National Railway Union and the Matsukawa Factory Union of the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Factory Workers' Union continued to struggle and became the core of the democratic forces in Fukushima Prefecture struggling for "independence and peace," thus clearly becoming the biggest obstacle to the implementation of fascist policies by imperialism. Therefore, the reactionaries did everything in their power to suppress, imprison, and destroy us.

The purpose of listing the above facts in detail is to hope that you can correctly grasp the situation at that time. Please forgive me.

From the facts of the Koriyama Parade Incident, which was the beginning of the Matsukawa Incident, the arrest and imprisonment of the cadres and workers of the Fukushima Branch of the Japan National Railway Union, and the Red Flag Incident of the Prefectural Government, it can be clearly seen that this was part of an organized and purposeful political conspiracy. From the triumphant situation of the prosecutors themselves in court, it can also be seen that most of their suppression plans have achieved their purpose. But one point that their plan failed was that they were unable to destroy the basic organization, party organs, and party functions of the Japanese Communist Party. The investigation documents, forged by the prosecutors and judges as evidence of the Matsukawa Incident, stated: "The Japanese Communist Party converted millions of cash, and the defendants on the Tokyo Shibaura side each received tens of thousands of yen as rewards for derailing the train" (evening of August 17, 1949). Therefore, the purpose of the plan drafted by the imperialists was obviously to suppress and destroy the Japanese Communist Party and make it illegal. Not only that, as the subsequent development of the situation showed, they wanted to make Japan a military base for invading Korea and antagonizing the People's Republic of China (invading Taiwan, bombing the Northeast, etc.). Today, it is clear that this is a major conspiracy of the so-called "imperialist world war plan of aggression."

It would be very fortunate for us if these facts could be told to all the brothers in China through your committee.

× × ×

Now I am preparing to criticize and introduce my own situation: Because I was a soldier in China, especially in Manchuria (now the Northeast), for five years, and lived in Dongning, Suifenhe, Harbin, Liaoyang, Haicheng, Fengtian (Shenyang), and other places, and had an unforgettable relationship with the railway. To give two or three examples: Such as changing the double track to a single track between Dalian and Dashiqiao, laying the Fengshan Line, building a wooden bridge (a preparatory bridge for the iron bridge) over the Juliuhe River on the Fengshan Line, changing the wide gauge (1.514 meters) at Suifenhe Station to the standard gauge (1.435 meters), and doing work on projects such as changing the gauge of freight cars. It is a pity that at that time I did not know that I was a tool of Japanese imperialism, and I even thought that it was very possible to realize the "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof, Construction of a Kingly Way and Paradise," so I did the above-mentioned work on the railway. Not long after the end of the war, I transferred to Korea, and did transportation work between Cheonan and Daejeon, where the Korean people are now fighting. I returned to my motherland in October 1945. My mother, wife, and eldest daughter, who was born in the Haicheng Army Hospital, also returned to the country stark naked. Only then did I gradually understand the aggressive and plundering nature of Japanese fascism and the Emperor system. So I felt deeply distressed, and after half a year of careful consideration, I figured it out. I decided that it was necessary to eliminate "poverty and unemployment" from society and create a world for the working people. That was my true work in life. So I returned to my original job on the Japan National Railway and worked as a freight clerk at Fukushima Station. While vowing to dedicate my life to the working people, I united the youth and organized the "National Railway Youth Association" at my job and was elected as the chairman. Later, most of the people who participated in this association became the backbone of the Fukushima Branch of the Japan National Railway Union, and almost all became Communist Party members, and fought for the democratization, independence, and peace of Japan. I am very proud of this. Suzuki Shin, Abe Ichiji, Takeda Hisashi, Ninomiya Yutaka, and other comrades who participated in the "National Railway Youth Association" have become the core of the Fukushima Branch of the Japan National Railway Union. Therefore, the union cadres of the Fukushima Branch are all young people. Although they have many shortcomings, they are quite active in action, so they have achieved remarkable results in democratizing all work. It is not difficult to understand that these union cadres will not go unnoticed by the enemy, and it is not without reason that the imperialists concentrate their efforts to suppress them.

In the course of about fifty days from July to August 1949, I had three indictments, Takeda, Okada, and Suzuki had two each, and Abe was fined six months (but suspended) under the Ashida Ordinance in 1948, plus two for the Matsukawa Incident. From this, it can be seen that the persecution of the enemy is very blatant. In the summer of 1948, Takeda was persecuted by being interrogated twelve times under the threat of a pistol for saying that Japan's railways were occupied by foreigners. These facts alone can explain what the American and Japanese reactionaries have done and are doing in Japan.

For this reason, I became a Communist Party member, and my wife also joined the party. In the struggle of the Matsukawa Incident, my mother also joined the party. (This process is recorded in the May 1950 issue of "New World.") The whole family has been able to fight for the independence and peace of Japan. The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union have now joined hands to become the bulwark of world peace and the mainstay of the peace-loving democratic forces of the people all over the world. These facts give us infinite and powerful encouragement and support. I, my mother, and my wife cannot but express our heartfelt gratitude to you as the Chinese people, especially to the Chinese railway worker brothers who are fighting on the railway like me. There is a very deep comradely friendship and trust between us. I am sorry for taking up so much space to talk about my personal affairs, but I would like to express my friendship to the Chinese brothers. Please forgive me.

× × ×

We are now receiving warm encouragement from peace-loving and conscientious people all over the world—especially the brothers in the People's Republic of China—and are further consolidating our confidence in victory, preparing to strive for victory in the second trial. According to recent reports, this case has been transferred to the Sendai High Court and is scheduled to be presided over by a judge named Suzuki. We will never fail the great support of the hundreds of millions of people united in the cause of world peace, truth, and democracy. We are prepared to fight resolutely to the end, regardless of any sacrifice. If we bow our heads to the tyranny of the imperialists, then they will surely launch a third world war to kill the people. We must not be afraid of sacrifice to smash these fascist bandits. We must not ignore the use of Japan as a base for invading your country and Korea and a powder keg for a third world war to strangle the people. We will spare no sacrifice to stop this atrocity and continue the struggle in response to the expectations, friendship, encouragement, and support of the international proletariat.

Chinese railway worker comrades! Although we are obstructed by cold thick walls, iron doors, and iron bars, we are flowing with boiling blood and have close and strong unity with you and the working class all over the world and the people fighting for independence, peace, and democracy. We have the belief in "the happiness of fighting and the happiness of victory" that the great Lenin educated us in. We can fight with the infinite and powerful encouragement and support of you and the people all over the world. We sincerely believe that it is glorious and happy.

We, the Japanese working class, will surely win! We will surely win in the "Matsukawa Incident"! Comrades! We swear that we will turn the words "justice can be victorious, and truth will also be victorious!" into reality and make resolute efforts to live up to your expectations and support.

As we finish writing this report with a feeling of gratitude, we express our heartfelt respect for the unity and struggle of the great Chinese people, and our deep respect and gratitude for the great Chinese working class, which stands at the forefront of the Chinese people and is the core of the strength of the Chinese people, fighting for the construction of New Democracy and the defense of world peace.

Sincerely shout "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of China!"

January 25, 1951, at Miyagi Prison, Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan

    日本“松川事件”无辜被告斋藤千
    给我国铁路工会全国委员会的信
    编者按：一九五○年十二月六日，美帝国主义在日本的走狗吉田反动政府统治下的福岛地方裁判所，借口一九四九年八月十七日发生的所谓“松川列车颠覆事件”，非法地将二十名日本共产党党员和爱国工人判处徒刑。吉田反动政府这一判决是违反波茨坦公告、严重危害日本工人阶级与日本人民的基本权利的罪恶行为；是美日反动派为了维系它们在日本的垂危的统治，镇压日本民主力量的可耻手段。下面这封信，是“松川事件”的无辜被难者斋藤千给我国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯的信。从这封信里，可以充分看出日本共产党党员和工人阶级的伟大气概和对最后胜利的无限信心。“松川事件”的第二审将于今年十月二十三日举行，斋藤千和他的战友们表示他们将坚决展开斗争，争取胜利，他们有着日本工人阶级、广大日本爱国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支援，他们将严厉地打击美日反动派将日本变作军事基地和殖民地的阴谋。中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯同志：
    一九五一年一月二十五日在宫城刑务所看到了贵委员会寄给日本国营铁路（简称国铁）工会统一委员会转给我们二十人的鼓励电报。我们在黑暗冰冷的狱中，接到诸位强有力的支援和鼓励，衷心表示感激和兴奋。特别是诸位对我们十名国铁工人的鼓舞和帮助，使我们感觉到非常愉快、亲密和温暖。
    如所周知，这个列车颠覆事件（按即“松川事件”）是美日反动派在执行反人民反共的凶恶政策中的一大政治阴谋。概括说来，一九四九年八月十七日上午三点十分发生的这一事件，可以判断为有下列几个目的：
    1、美日反动派制造下山、三鹰事件是企图根据“定员法”（按指强迫限定国营企业机构内职工一定额数的反动立法，一九四九年五月成立）强迫实行国营铁路的裁员，破坏工人的团结。但裁员以后，共产党员和进步工人仍旧停留在岗位上，重建新组织并反对加强劳动强度，因此逐渐和全体人民团结在一起展开了斗争。而裁员后的效果是很微小的。在当时情况下，吉田卖国贼的这一阴谋对于强迫邮电工会实行裁员也是很必要的手段。
    2、国营铁路工会福岛支部当时站在反对裁员、保卫国营铁路斗争的最前列，特别是积极反对自一九四九年逐渐侵入国铁的“美援对等资金”的投资而展开了斗争。如所周知，如果铁路遭受外国资本的支配就意味着一国的工业、经济和以此为基础的政治，也要被外国资本所操纵，因而这个国家就成为外国资本的殖民地或半殖民地了。这就是帝国主义时代典型的特征。因此我们就在“反对国铁‘满铁’（按指战前日本帝国主义在南满占有的铁道）化”的口号下进行了斗争。
    由于一九四九年七月四日的福岛管理部事件（按指：为了反对裁员，约一千名国铁工会会员于七月四日夜集体向福岛管理部长进行交涉，但由于美国占领军沙格能中校的命令，福岛市约三百名警察前来镇压，迫使交涉中止。当时我们整齐地排好了队伍，以工会会旗为前导，唱着国际歌退走了。以此为理由，铃木信、武田久、冈田良松和我被逮捕起诉，但一次也没公审过）及至七月七日，因揭发伊达站不合理的事件（根据四月的工会全国大会和五月的支部大会的决议，揭发铁路干部不合理的行为，因为使工作岗位民主化明朗化是当时斗争的中心任务，我曾和约二十名工人一同到伊达站调查不合理行为的真实情况以及车站的干部对工会会员的压迫和不合理的裁员等事，并且为了消灭这些现象和车站干部订立了契约，因此遭到CIC——即美军情报部的搜查，我于七月十三日被捕。进行一星期的饥饿反抗，于八月保释后被起诉。这二十名当中，被认为松川事件当事人之一的赤间胜美君，他也被起诉了，但尚未开始公审），福岛工会支部的干部几乎全部被捕入狱。
    再把时间拉长一点谈：
    一九四九年六月三十日发生“平事件”（武装警官镇压平市保卫共产党壁报的矿山工人的事件，有一百五十名被告在公审时坚持着斗争），与此相关联的，在福岛市有县政府红旗事件（六月三十日，在福岛县的议会附近，工人市民举行游行反对裁员，要求保卫国家产业和赊卖粮食，在县议会内由日本国营铁路东京、芝浦电气工厂的工人们第一次挂起了红旗和工会旗，这一逮捕事件也成了松川事件的肇端，参加这一游行的日本国营铁路东京芝浦电气工厂松川工场工会的工人们都成为“松川”事件的被告），在郡山市有郡山市署游行事件（为了抗议平市的镇压事件，以郡山市国铁工人为中心的工人们向市署提出了抗议，这成为松川事件的肇端，第一审完了，被非法逮捕的十名中，有八名判罪，但缓期执行，有二名无罪），在若松市有广田制钢事件（三菱广田制钢工会的工会委员长山口同志，为反对厂方裁员进行集体交涉，并和工厂厂长订立了“不裁员”的契约书，但后来又被军政府强迫放弃了。为了要求释放被拘押于若松警察署的山口委员长，以日本国营铁路工人为中心的工人，举行了示威游行）。对于这些由美日反动派联合指挥、由福岛县警察署计划和执行的有组织的挑拨和镇压事件，国营铁路工会福岛支部一方面全力驳斥，一方面攻击敌人的弱点，进行反对外资侵入和裁员、保卫国营铁路“反对国铁‘满铁’化”和揭发不合理事件的斗争。
    这一切斗争的中心目标是为了“完全履行波茨坦公告”、“民族独立”、“全面媾和”和“反对军事基地化”。
    在狱中，我们（福岛刑务所有武田久、冈田良松、赤间胜美、我本人等）进行了一周至十天的饥饿抗议，反对无理镇压和逮捕。斗争的结果，在一九四九年八月三日，武田、冈田、我化了一万元保释金出狱，赤间由国营铁路工会福岛支部垫出了一万元保释金（这笔钱和“松川事件”发生了关系，因为审判时检事和卖国奴法官硬说赤间做了使列车颠覆的工作）于八月一日出所。
    八月六日、七日，在郡山市召开国营铁路工会福岛支部大会时，主张把被裁的工会会员赶出去的民主化同盟分子（右翼社会民主主义者的集团，简称“民同”）和反对这一主张的统一派经过激烈的争论，最后的结果是有良心的工会会员退出会场，继续和
    “民同”的暴力进行斗争。
    这样，国营铁路工会福岛支部，东京、芝浦电气工厂工人联合会松川工场工会一面继续斗争，一面成为福岛县为争取“独立与和平”而斗争的民主势力核心，这样显然的就成为帝国主义推行法西斯政策的最大障碍物，因此反动派们用尽全力对我们实行镇压、下狱和破坏。
    详举以上事实的目的是希望能使你们正确地掌握当时的情况，尚请原谅。
    从作为松川事件肇端的郡山游行事件、日本国营铁路工会福岛支部干部工人被逮捕下狱和县政府红旗事件的事实中，可以明显地看出，这是有组织有目的大政治阴谋的一部分，从检事本人在法庭上得意的情形也可以看出他们的镇压计划大部分已达到了目的。但他们计划失败的一点就是没有能够破坏日本共产党的基本组织、党机关及党的机能。他们列举了平事件以来的事件，非常明显地是企图使日本共产党非法化。做为松川事件的证据而为检事法官所伪造的调查书上写着：“日本共产党化了数百万的现金，东、芝方面的被告每人都接到了使列车颠覆的酬劳金数万元”（一九四九年八月十七日傍晚）。因此，帝国主义者们所拟计划的目的，显然地是要镇压和破坏日本共产党，并使其非法化，不仅如此，正如以后事态发展所表现的，他们为了使日本成为侵略朝鲜并与中华人民共和国为敌（侵略台湾，轰炸东北等）的根据地而使它军事基地化。在今天可以明显看出，这乃是所谓“帝国主义者侵略世界战争计划”的一大阴谋。
    这些事实如能通过贵委员会告诉全中国的弟兄们，对我们是很幸运的。
    ×    ×    ×
    现在准备一面批判一面介绍一下我自己的事情：因为我曾在中国，特别是满洲（现在的东北）当了五年军人，住过东宁、绥芬河、哈尔滨、辽阳、海城、奉天（沈阳）等地，和铁路有一段忘不了的关系。举其二、三事谈：如在大连——大石桥间把双线改为单线，铺设奉山线，在奉山线的巨流河上架木桥（做铁桥的预备桥），把绥芬河站内的宽轨（一公尺五一四）改为标准轨（一公尺四三五），将货车改轨等工程中做过工，很遗憾的是当时我并不知道自己是做了日本帝国主义者的工具，而且还认为这是很有可能实现“八紘一宇建设王道乐土”的，所以才做了上述的那些铁道上的工作。战争结束不久，转到了朝鲜，在现在朝鲜人民战斗着的天安—大田间做运输工作。一九四五年十月回祖国，我的母亲、妻子及在海城陆军病院生的长女也都赤光光的回国了，至此才渐渐明白了日本法西斯和天皇制的侵略强盗本质。于是我深深感到苦恼，经过半年的深思熟虑才想通了，结果下了决心，认为必须从社会上消灭“贫困和失业”创造一个劳动人民的世界，才是我一生的真正工作，于是回到原来的工作岗位日本国营铁路上，在福岛站当货运员；一面发誓把一生献给劳动人民，一面在工作岗位上团结青年阶层、组织“国营铁路青年会”并被选为会长。以后参加这个会的大部人员都成为日本国营铁路工会福岛支部的中坚，也几乎全成为共产党员，而为日本的民主化、独立和平而斗争，这一点我很堪自慰。参加“国营铁路青年会”的铃木信、阿部市次、武田久、二宫丰诸同志，他们已经成了日本国营铁路工会福岛支部的核心。所以福岛支部的工会干部，完全是青年。虽然他们的缺点很多，但在行动上相当活跃，因此在使一切工作民主化上获得了显著的成绩。不难了解，这些工会干部是不会不被敌人注意的，而帝国主义者们集中力量镇压他们也不是没有缘故的。
    在一九四九年七月至八月约五十天的工夫当中，我的起诉书有三张，武田、冈田、铃木二张，阿部在一九四八年根据芦田政令被罚刑六个月（但缓期执行）还有松川事件的二张。由此可见敌人的迫害是非常露骨的。一九四八年夏，武田因为说了一句日本的铁路被外国人所占有的话，就遭受到十二次在手枪的威吓下被查讯的迫害。仅仅这些事实，就可以说明在日本的美日反动派做了一些什么并正在做些什么。
    由于这个原因，我成了共产党员，妻也入了党，在松川事件的斗争中，母亲也入了党。（这个经过载在一九五○年五月份的“新世界”中）一家全体能够一直为了日本的独立、和平而斗争。中华人民共和国和苏联，现在已并肩成为拥护世界和平的堡垒及全世界人民爱好和平民主力量的中坚。这些事实给与我们无限的有力的鼓舞和支援。我和母亲、妻子，对于作为中国人民的你们，不能不衷心感谢，特别是对和我一样同在铁路上斗争的中国铁路工人兄弟们，存在着非常深切的同志般的友爱和信赖。谈我个人的事情占了很长的篇幅，很是对不住，因为想对中国的兄弟们申述友情，还请见谅。
    ×    ×    ×
    我们现在从全世界爱好和平和有良心的人民——特别是中华人民共和国弟兄们接到了充满温暖的鼓励而更巩固了胜利的信心，准备在第二审中争取胜利。根据最近的报告，本案已移交仙台高等裁判所，并内定以铃木某为裁判长，我们决不辜负团结在爱好世界和平、真理和为民主主义而奋斗中的数亿人民的伟大支援，我们准备不顾任何牺牲而坚决斗争到底。假如我们向帝国主义者的暴虐低头，那么他们一定会发起第三次世界大战来杀害人民的。我们必须不怕牺牲来粉碎这些法西斯匪徒们。我们绝不能忽视使日本成为侵略贵国和朝鲜的基地及第三次世界大战的火药库以扼杀人民的，我们决不惜牺牲来阻止这个暴行以回答国际无产阶级的期待、友情、鼓励和支援而继续斗争下去。
    诸位中国铁路工人同志！我们之间纵然被冰冷的厚墙、铁门、铁格子障碍着，但我们却奔流着沸腾的热血，和你们以及全世界的劳动阶级及为独立和平和民主主义而奋斗的人民们有着紧密的坚强的团结。我们具有伟大的列宁所教育我们的“战斗的幸福和胜利的幸福”的信念，我们能在诸位和全世界人民无限有力的鼓励和支援下进行斗争。正衷心认为光荣和幸福的。
    我们日本工人阶级一定会胜利的！我们在“松川事件”中也一定会胜利的！诸位同志！我们宣誓一定要把“正义是能战胜的，真理也会战胜的！”的话变为事实，为符合诸位的期待和支援做坚决的努力。
    当我们把这报告用充满感谢的感情写完的时候，对伟大的中国人民的团结和奋斗衷心表示敬意，对成为中国人民力量的核心站在中国人民的前列、为新民主主义的建设和拥护世界和平而斗争的伟大的中国工人阶级深表敬意和谢意。
    衷心高喊中国的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
