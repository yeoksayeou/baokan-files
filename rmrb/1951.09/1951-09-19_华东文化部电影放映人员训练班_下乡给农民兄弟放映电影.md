    East China Culture Department Film Projectionist Training Class
    Goes to the Countryside to Show Films to Farmer Brothers

    Comrade Editor:
    In order to expand the organization of projection teams, the East China Culture Department entrusted the South Jiangsu Cultural Education Institute to host a film projectionist training class this summer. I am one of the trainees. After more than two months of study, we are about to go to the four regions of Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Southern Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu to conduct mobile screenings and show New China's films to our farmer brothers. After we learned the theory in the classroom, in order to connect with practice, we went to the suburbs of Wuxi City for internship screenings. During the screening, an old farmer, Wang Xinggen, said, "Chairman Mao is so good, he sent a film team to our doorstep!" An old woman, Wang, who had never seen a movie, said excitedly, "Chairman Mao cares about us so much, teaching us to overthrow feudalism and dig out the roots of poverty, and now he is sending us movies to watch. How can we thank him enough!" From this, we deeply realized the laboring people's love and gratitude for the leader and their enthusiastic demand for cultural entertainment. We must work hard to do a good job in the countryside screening work.

    华东文化部电影放映人员训练班
    下乡给农民兄弟放映电影编辑同志：
    华东文化部电影处为了扩大放映队的组织，今年暑假托苏南文化教育学院主办了一个电影放映人员训练班。我是其中的一个学员。我们经过了两个多月的学习，即将分赴皖南、皖北、苏南、苏北四区进行巡回放映工作，把新中国的影片演给农民兄弟看。当我们在课堂学习了理论以后，为了联系实际，我们曾到无锡市郊区进行实习放映。放映时，一个年老的农民王杏根说：“毛主席真好啊，他派电影队上门来啦！”一个从来没有看过电影的王大娘更是激动地说：“毛主席这样关心我们，教我们推翻封建，挖出穷根，现在又送电影给我们看，我们要怎样来感谢他老人家哩！”从这里使我们深切地体会到劳动人民对领袖的热爱和感激，和对文化娱乐的热烈要求。我们要努力做好下乡的放映工作。
