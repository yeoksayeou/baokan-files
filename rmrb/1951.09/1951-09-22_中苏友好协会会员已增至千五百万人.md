Xinhua News Agency: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country, in accordance with the spirit of the First National Work Conference last year, have vigorously carried out internationalist propaganda and education work on Sino-Soviet friendship in close connection with the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and have also achieved significant development in their organization. According to recent incomplete statistics, the number of members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country has reached 15,031,377, an increase of nearly four times compared to 1950. Workers and peasants account for a large proportion of the membership. In cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, worker members account for 36.3 percent. In the Southern Sichuan District and Hunan Province, peasant members account for more than 70 percent of the total local membership. Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations have been established in the following places across the country: four major administrative regions, 48 provinces, cities, and administrative districts equivalent to provinces, 74 provincial cities, one autonomous region (Inner Mongolia), 1,126 counties, and 26,073 units such as government offices, factories, schools, streets, and rural areas. In Northeast and North China, more than one-half of the rural areas have established organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The only places where organizations have not yet been established are the two major administrative regions of East China and Northwest China, Xikang Province, the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Taiwan, which is yet to be liberated.

In the past year, Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions have generally corrected the tendencies of closed-doorism and isolated work. In many places, Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations have absorbed local heads of people's organizations to participate in the executive committees and have assisted various people's organizations in establishing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association work committees within their own organizations, thus greatly expanding the scope of work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations. Many local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations have united a large number of activists and overcome the difficulties of insufficient funding and lack of cadres. For example, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in Beijing, Lüda, Shenyang, Harbin, Tieling, Tangshan, and Shanxi have trained 5,000 activists through training courses in the past year. The Tangshan Sino-Soviet Friendship Association regularly holds symposiums for activists, arranges work, and organizes them to study. These activists are enthusiastic about providing voluntary service and have become the main force in promoting various tasks.

    中苏友好协会会员已增至千五百万人
    【新华社讯】全国各地中苏友好协会依照去年第一次全国工作会议决定的精神，密切结合抗美援朝运动大力进行了中苏友好的国际主义宣传教育工作，在组织上也已获得重大发展。根据最近不完全统计，全国中苏友好协会会员已达一千五百零三万一千三百七十七人。比一九五零年增加了近四倍。会员中，工人和农民的比重较大。北京、天津、上海、武汉等市的工人会员占百分之三十六点三。川南区及湖南省的农民会员都占当地会员总数的百分之七十以上。全国已建立中苏友好协会组织的地方计有：四个大行政区，四十八个省、市和相当于省的行署区，七十四个省属市，一个自治区（内蒙），一千一百二十六个县以及二万六千零七十三个机关、工厂、学校、街道、农村等单位。东北、华北两地，二分之一以上的农村都已建立了中苏友好协会的组织。目前尚未建立组织的地方，省、市以上的仅有华东、西北两大行政区，西康省、西藏自治区及待解放的台湾。
    在这一年中，各地中苏友好协会一般都纠正了关门主义和孤立进行工作的偏向。不少地方中苏友好协会都吸收当地各人民团体负责人参加干事会，并协助各人民团体在其内部建立了中苏友好协会工作委员会，因而使中苏友好协会的工作范围大大推广。许多地方的中苏友好协会团结了大批积极分子，克服了经费少、干部缺的困难。如北京、旅大、沈阳、哈尔滨、铁岭、唐山及山西等地中苏友好协会一年来通过训练班培养的积极分子达五千人，唐山市中苏友好协会定期召开积极分子座谈会，布置工作，组织他们进行学习。这些积极分子都热心义务服务，成为推动各项工作的主要力量。
