    "Steel Warrior Cao Xiquan" Educated Me
    To the Editor:

    The Korean dispatch "Steel Warrior Cao Xiquan" published in your newspaper deeply moved me. A dauntless warrior like Cao Xiquan, forged in the flames of war, is precisely the kind of person I admire most.

    At the same time, it made me understand two things.

    First, it made me more deeply appreciate that the people's army is not only a brave and skilled army, but also an army with a high degree of political awareness. They know why they are fighting, so they fight with superhuman courage. Like the steel warrior Cao Xiquan, in the severe cold of thirty degrees below zero, with his feet frozen and peeling, he still insisted on a rapid march for a day and a night, and even used his hands instead of his feet to crawl a full thirty *li*, completing the battle task assigned to him by the people to eliminate the American invading army. How could the American invading army, with its demoralized soldiers and wavering morale, not suffer a tragic defeat in the face of our heroic soldiers?

    Second, it made me realize how a spirit of revolutionary heroism is nurtured and carried forward in our volunteer army. Before crossing the Yalu River, the steel warrior Cao Xiquan made up his mind to strive for meritorious service and become a combat model in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. When his body suffered the cruel torture of nature, and when he accepted arduous combat tasks on the front line, he consistently demonstrated a noble and indomitable will. "Steel Warrior Cao Xiquan" once again profoundly educated me. I will study hard and be ready to dedicate myself to the motherland at any time.

### “钢铁战士曹希泉”教育了我

    “钢铁战士曹希泉”教育了我编辑同志：
    你报刊载的朝鲜通讯“钢铁战士曹希泉”一文，使我受了很深刻的感动。像曹希泉这样在战火中锻炼出来的不屈不挠的勇士，正是我最崇敬的人物。
    同时，它使我明白了两个东西。
    第一、使我更深刻地体会到人民的军队不但是一支英勇善战的军队，而且是一支具有高度政治觉悟的军队。他们晓得为何而战，所以打起仗来，就有超人的勇敢。像钢铁战士曹希泉，在零下三十度的严寒天气，脚被冻得脱了皮，仍坚持一天一夜的急速进军，而且用手代足，整整爬了三十里，完成人民交给他的消灭美国侵略军的战斗任务。士气涣散、军心动摇的美国侵略军，在我们英勇的战士面前，怎能不遭受悲惨的失败？
    第二、使我体会到一种革命英雄主义的思想，是怎样在我们的志愿军中滋长和发扬光大。钢铁战士曹希泉在跨过鸭绿江前夕，就下了争取立功，当个抗美援朝的战斗模范的决心；当他的肉体遭受到自然残酷的折磨的时候，当他在火线上接受了艰巨的战斗任务的时候，自始至终，一直表现着一往无前的崇高意志。“钢铁战士曹希泉”再一次深刻地教育了我。我将努力学习，随时准备着献身祖国。
