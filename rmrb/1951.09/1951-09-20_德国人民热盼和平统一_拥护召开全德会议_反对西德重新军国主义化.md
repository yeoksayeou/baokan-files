Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 18th: The statement issued by Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic and the letter from the People's Chamber to the Bonn Federal Assembly have been warmly supported by the broad masses of the people throughout Germany.

News from all parts of the German Democratic Republic proves that countless social organizations and broad sections of the people are enthusiastically supporting the People's Chamber's proposal to convene an All-German Conference to hold free and democratic elections throughout Germany and accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The National Front of Democratic Germany held conferences in various cities and districts on September 16, where representatives from all walks of life discussed various ways to implement the proposals of the People's Chamber. The National Front conferences held in various places have become a manifestation of unity and unanimous demand for peace and unity in Germany. In mass meetings held in various enterprises in recent days, the working people unanimously and warmly supported the proposals of the People's Chamber. Workers, engineers, and technicians have all set new production guarantees for the cause of peace.

The Central Bureau of the Free German Trade Union Federation wrote to the leadership of the West German Trade Union Federation and its members and staff, urging them to support the proposals of the People's Chamber. The trade union leadership of the Thalmann Factory in Magdeburg wrote to the production committee of the Krupp Factory in Essen, urging Essen workers to participate in the struggle against West German remilitarization and actively support the proposal to convene an All-German Conference.

The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, representing millions of German youth, issued a letter to German youth, expressing enthusiastic support for the Grotewohl statement and the People's Chamber proposals, and calling on them to use all methods to prevent the proposed measures of recruiting West German youth as cannon fodder, and to strengthen the ranks of youth to fight for peace and German unity.

People from all walks of life in West Germany also universally support the Grotewohl statement and the proposals of the People's Chamber. Pastor Niemöller, head of the Hessian Evangelical Church, said that he fully agreed with the proposals of the government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. Niemöller said: The speedy realization of these proposals can end the division of Germany and guarantee a bright future for the German people. Dr. Hambeck, a doctor in Nuremberg, said: He believes that the recent letter from the People's Chamber is proof of a sincere determination to reach mutual understanding and a sign of the German Democratic Republic government's desire to peacefully resolve the German question. Dr. Belmanns, a lawyer in Nuremberg, said: He believes that the new proposals are the only path that can ultimately lead to the establishment of a unified government, and Adenauer's consistent refusal to hold negotiations with East Germany is completely wrong.

The people of West Berlin also support Grotewohl's statement and the proposals of the People's Chamber. The conference of the National Front of Democratic Germany in Berlin-Neukölln (in the American occupation zone) passed a resolution stating: "The representatives of the residents of Neukölln attending the conference guarantee that they will do their utmost to promote the realization of the proposals of the People's Chamber." All the representatives attending the conference of the National Front in Berlin-Tiergarten (in the British occupation zone) called on all German patriots to unite in action to ensure the early realization of the People's Chamber proposals.

    德国人民热盼和平统一
    拥护召开全德会议
    反对西德重新军国主义化
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥发表的声明和人民议会致波恩联邦议会的信件获得全德国广大人民的热烈拥护。
    来自德意志民主共和国各地的消息证明，无数的社团和广大阶层的人民都热诚拥护人民议会关于召开全德会议以便在全德国举行自由民主的选举并加速缔结对德和约的建议。民主德国全国阵线于九月十六日在各市、区举行了大会，各界代表在大会上讨论了各种实现人民议会建议的办法。各地所举行的全国阵线大会变成了团结一致要求德国和平和统一的表现。在各企业最近几天所举行的群众大会上，劳动人民一致热烈拥护人民议会的建议。职工们、工程师与技师们都为和平事业定下了新的生产保证。
    自由德国工会联合会中央局写信给西德工会联合会的领导机构及该会会员和职员，敦促他们支持人民议会的建议。马格德堡台尔曼工厂的工会领导机构写信给埃森克虏伯工厂的生产委员会，敦促埃森工人参加反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争，并积极支持召开全德会议的建议。
    代表数百万德国青年的自由德国青年联盟中央委员会发表告德国青年书，表示热烈拥护格罗提渥声明和人民议会建议，并号召用一切方法阻止拟议中的招募西德青年充当炮灰的措施，加强青年的队伍为和平与德国的统一而斗争。
    西德各阶层人民也普遍拥护格罗提渥声明和人民议会建议。黑森福音教会会长尼莫勒说他完全同意德意志民主共和国政府和人民议会的建议。尼莫勒说：这些建议的尽速实现可以终止德国的分裂，并保证德国人民美好的将来。纽伦堡医生哈姆贝克博士说：他认为人民议会最近的信件是诚挚地决心达成相互谅解的证明，也是德意志民主共和国政府要和平解决德国问题的愿望的表示。纽伦堡律师柏尔曼斯博士说：他认为新建议是最后能导向创立统一的政府的唯一道路，阿登纳过去一贯拒绝与东德举行谈判是完全错误的。
    柏林西区人民也都拥护格罗提渥的声明和人民议会的建议。民主德国全国阵线柏林新科隆区（在美国占领区）的大会通过决议称：“出席大会的新科隆区居民代表保证他们用最大努力促成人民议会建议的实现。”出席全国阵线柏林蒂尔加登区（英国占领区）大会的全体代表号召一切德国爱国分子联合行动起来以求人民议会的建议早日实现。
