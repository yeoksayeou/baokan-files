    A Successful Session of the District People's Representative Conference
    ——Introducing the Experience of the Fourth Session of the First District People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality
    Song Dalei, Xu Gongmin
    The Fourth Session of the First District People's Representative Conference of Beijing's Second District, convened in mid-August, has exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elected the District Head, Deputy District Head, and members of the District Government. This is a first in Beijing or in the urban districts of major cities nationwide. The key to the success of this election in the district lies in trusting the masses, promoting democracy, and boldly mobilizing the masses. This is reflected in the bottom-up generation of candidates and in the adoption of necessary measures to overcome the temporary lack of familiarity among various strata of urban residents.

    Before the meeting, a few members of the district's consultative committee disagreed with the bottom-up nomination method proposed by the groups. They feared that it would "fail to take into account all strata and the characteristics of the district" and that it would "put forward inappropriate candidates." Among the representatives to the District People's Representative Conference, there were many incorrect views and doubts about democratic elections. Some wondered, "The District Head and Deputy District Head are doing quite well, so why should we re-elect them?" Others questioned, "Can people other than cadres serve as members of the District Government? If they are elected as members, will they have to leave production and join the government?" In order to unify the guiding ideology, the district convened two sessions of the District Consultative Committee before the meeting. After repeated debates, they finally unified their views on democratic elections. Then, separate forums were held for representatives from different strata, such as workers, cultural and educational circles, healthcare, industry and commerce, and street residents, to explain the significance of the democratic election and related issues. This dispelled everyone's doubts and conducted preliminary deliberations on the candidates. This practice of paying attention to the ideological problems of cadres and the masses beforehand and resolving them in a timely manner is an important step in the success of this democratic election in the district.

    The election in the district went through repeated deliberations and in-depth discussions. First, the groups nominated candidates, and then adopted methods such as "sending students," "inviting teachers," and "sending materials" to exchange, introduce, and understand the candidates. Each group sent people to listen in and visit other groups, and then reported back to their own group; or invited people to come to their group to introduce the detailed history and work performance of a candidate; or wrote the exemplary deeds of the candidates nominated by their group into written materials and distributed them to other groups for reference. This allowed each group to learn from each other's strengths and come up with a more comprehensive list of candidates, including many non-representatives and non-consultative committee members. After the presidium comprehensively sorted it out, it sent the list of candidates jointly nominated by most groups to each group for further discussion, and at the same time called on the representatives to carefully consider, "speak boldly, say whatever you have to say." Therefore, the discussions in each group were more enthusiastic and in-depth than before, and the candidates were repeatedly studied and compared, and criticism and self-criticism were launched. The achievements and shortcomings of the candidates (including cadres and activists) in their daily work were pointed out and strictly reviewed. The representatives said, "We must carefully weigh the candidates, and choose the better from the good ones," "If you have something to say, you must say it, don't keep it to yourself," achieving "knowing everything and saying everything without reservation." The representatives were in high spirits. Some insisted on participating in the discussion despite their illness; some sleep-talked about electing the district head; some groups delayed their meal times; and some street residents' groups discussed until 12 o'clock in the evening in order to consider appropriate candidates before adjourning. After the second round of discussions in each group, the presidium summarized everyone's opinions and put forward a formal list of candidates. At the same time, since no suitable candidates were nominated from the street residents, the presidium specially recommended a candidate. The list of candidates was submitted to the conference for approval before the voting election. This method of generating candidates in the district fully promoted democracy and was unanimously supported by all the representatives. This is the decisive key to the success of this democratic election in the district.

    In this election in the district, due to the high level of education of urban residents, a method of anonymous joint voting was adopted. The election results were very good, the votes were very concentrated, and the elected government members included people from all walks of life, taking into account the characteristics of the district. Among the fifteen members, six were government workers, two each from people's organizations, workers, and industry and commerce, and one each from cultural and educational circles, medical circles, and street residents. The representatives and people from all walks of life expressed great satisfaction. However, the district also had some shortcomings in this election, the most important of which was that the pre-election publicity and education work was not extensive and in-depth enough.

    一次成功的区各界人民代表会议
    ——介绍北京市第二区一届四次各界人民代表会议的经验
    宋大雷、徐功敏
    北京市第二区于八月中旬召开的一届四次各界人民代表会议，已代行了人民代表大会职权，选出正、副区长和区政府委员。这在北京市或全国各大城市的城区中都还是第一次。该区这次选举的成功经验是信任群众，发扬民主，大胆放手发动群众。这表现在由下而上的产生候选人，以及采取必要的办法克服城市居民各阶层间暂时还存在着的互不熟悉的困难。
    会议召开前，该区协商委员会中有少数协商委员不同意自下而上小组提名的选举方法。唯恐“照顾不到各阶层，照顾不到本区特点”，“提出不妥当的人选”。在区各界人民代表会议的代表中间，则存在着很多对民主选举的不正确的看法和怀疑。有的以为“区长和副区长都挺好，为什么还要改选呢？”有的则怀疑：“干部以外的人是否能担任区政府的委员？被选成委员以后，是否要脱离生产参加政府工作？”为了求得领导思想的统一，该区在会前曾先后召开了两次区协商委员会，经反复争论，终于统一了对民主选举的看法。然后又分别召开了工人、文教、卫生、工商和街道居民等不同阶层的代表座谈会，说明此次民主选举的意义和有关问题。解除了大家的疑问，并对候选人作了初步酝酿。这种事前注意了解干部和群众的思想问题及时加以解决的作法，是该区这次民主选举做得好的一个重要步骤。
    该区这次的选举，经过了反复酝酿、深入讨论。先由各小组提出候选人，然后采取“留学”“请老师”“送材料”等办法，彼此交流、介绍、了解这些候选人的情况。各组互派人去旁听、访问，回来再向本组报告；或者请人到本组来介绍某一候选人的详细历史和工作表现；或者把本组提出的候选人的模范事迹写成书面材料，分送各组参考。这样就使各组能够取长补短，提出了包括很多非代表和非协商委员的、较为全面的候选人名单。主席团综合整理后，把多数组共同提出的候选人的名单发交各组进一步讨论，同时号召代表们慎重考虑，“大胆发言，有什么说什么”。因此各小组的讨论比以前更为热烈深入，把候选人反复研究比较，而且展开了批评和自我批评。候选人（包括干部和积极分子）平日工作的成绩和缺点，都被大家指出来，进行了严格的审查。代表们说：“咱们要把候选人认真的称一称，从好的里头挑更好的”，“心里有话，就要说出来，别存着”，作到了“知无不言，言无不尽”。代表们的情绪很高涨，有的带病坚持参加讨论；有的睡觉说梦话还喊选区长；有的组耽误了吃饭时间；有的街道居民组为了考虑适当的人选而讨论到深夜十二时才休会。各小组第二次讨论完毕后，由主席团综合大家的意见提出正式候选人名单；同时由于街道居民中没有提出适当的人选，特由主席团推荐了一个候选人。候选人名单交大会通过后进行投票选举。该区这种候选人产生办法，充分地发扬了民主，获得全体代表一致拥护。这是该区这次民主选举能够成功的决定关键。
    该区这次选举，由于城市居民文化程度较高，采取了无记名联记投票方法。选举结果很好，选票很集中，而且选出的政府委员包括了各界人士，照顾到该区的特点。十五名委员中有政权工作者六名，人民团体、工人和工商界各二人，文教界、医务界和街道居民各一名。代表和各界人民都表示非常满意。不过该区在这次选举中也有一些缺点，最主要的是会前的宣传教育工作不够广泛和深入。
