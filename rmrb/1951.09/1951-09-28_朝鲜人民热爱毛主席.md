The common cause of the Chinese and Korean people against the American aggressors has increased the friendship between the two peoples a hundredfold. The appearance of the Chinese People's Volunteers and their high degree of internationalism have been deeply admired by the Korean people. The Korean people's respect for the great Chinese nation and their gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers are concentrated in their cheers and love for Chairman Mao.

This spring, I had just crossed the Yalu River, in the rear far from the front line, under the shade of trees by the roadside, when I suddenly heard the song "The East is Red" sung in Chinese; I saw a group of girls around ten years old walking over, they happily shouted "Mao Zedong Mansei (Long Live)," on those innocent faces, there appeared a kind and trusting color, their eyes radiating admiration and love. Later, at every gathering attended by Korean comrades, on the ruins of many destroyed towns and villages close to the front line, I heard them sing "The East is Red," "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China," and other of the motherland's most popular songs in not very proficient Chinese. Many times, I watched this touching scene: the singers gazed into the distance, their voices filled with heartfelt respect, their eyes expressing confidence in victory.

The Chinese People's Volunteers have received the most enthusiastic reception in every region of Korea. In most cases, because the two sides do not speak the same language, the Korean people shout "Long Live Mao Zedong" to express their gratitude when they see the Volunteers. Whenever the Volunteers meet the People's Army on the battlefield, the troops resound with shouts of "Stalin! Mao Zedong! Kim Il-sung!" And at the joint gatherings of the Volunteers, the People's Army, and the Korean people, people always sing "The East is Red" and "Glory to Stalin" and "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" together.

Korean revolutionaries have long been familiar with Chairman Mao, and from Chairman Mao's brilliant works, they have come to understand that he is their most trusted mentor and friend. This July, on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, a comrade from the Workers' Party said: "Now I see in the newspapers that many countries are translating Comrade Mao Zedong's works, but we in Korea translated them a long time ago." Many of Chairman Mao's works have been translated into Korean, and various pamphlets have been published in large quantities, especially "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," and "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," which have been most widely distributed. The Workers' Party's newspaper, "Rodong Sinmun," and the Party's magazine, "Kulloja," promptly translated and published the works of Chairman Mao and his close comrades-in-arms Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and others. Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party," "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," and "On Internationalism and Nationalism" have had an important influence on Korean comrades. Members of the Korean Workers' Party and non-Party cadres attach great importance to studying Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese issue courses at the Workers' Party School teach all of Chairman Mao's works; in general schools, when discussing colonial, semi-colonial, and national issues, they also talk about Chairman Mao's scientific predictions and revolutionary theories. When I talked to several Korean writers, they all said that Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" pointed out the correct path for their creative work.

After the "August 15th" liberation in 1945, Korean revolutionaries, regardless of the suppression and persecution by the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, also published a large number of Chairman Mao's works in South Korea. In 1947, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was published in Seoul. Because Chairman Mao's works were widely circulated, many books had several translations. In July and August of that year, the anti-Communist measures of the American-Rhee bandit gang intensified, and the Workers' Party was forced to go underground. Chairman Mao's works continued to be published and distributed in secret. Even in prisons, imprisoned revolutionary patriots could see Chairman Mao's works, which encouraged their fighting will. Comrade Ryu Chu-un, a member of the Workers' Party who was arrested and imprisoned by the reactionaries, recalled that they often studied Chairman Mao's books in prison. Another comrade, Lee Kwang-seok, who was arrested and imprisoned in Seodaemun Prison in Seoul at the same time as him, said: "At that time, we had to recite Comrade Mao Zedong's 'Combat Liberalism' every morning, and we always ate after we finished reciting it." Comrade Ryu Chu-un is an old revolutionary in Korea who spent eighteen years in reactionary prisons. He said that fifteen years ago, in Hamhung Prison, he suddenly obtained the Chinese Communist Party's "August 1st Declaration," from which he learned about the proposal for an anti-Japanese national united front. He said: "At that time, many of us were very excited, even more happy than seeing food after being hungry for a few days. From then on, we realized even more the correctness and greatness of Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership."

In 1948, guerrilla warfare broke out in various parts of South Korea. Chairman Mao's works on guerrilla warfare and strategic tactics, and the rich experience of the Chinese Communist Party in conducting guerrilla warfare, became the classics for the Workers' Party to launch and lead guerrilla warfare. A Korean comrade who had participated in guerrilla warfare recalled that the Party printed Chairman Mao's works and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's works on guerrilla warfare and distributed them to guerrilla cadres and fighters to read. They told the story of General Lee Hyun-sang, a member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and a recipient of the First Class National Flag Medal, who led the guerrilla team in Mount Jiri and always carried two books with him during the arduous war: one was "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and the other was Chairman Mao's "Strategic Problems of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare". General Lee is nearly fifty years old, and the "Lee Hyun-sang Guerrilla Team" he led was one of the earliest guerrilla teams established in South Korea. It operated in Gyeongsangnam-do, Jeollabuk-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do, and was the largest guerrilla base in South Korea.

In the regular units of the People's Army, the officers and soldiers' love for Chairman Mao is growing day by day. An officer of the People's Army told a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the anniversary of the Korean War: "Now in our army, all those who can understand Chinese books are trying to read the works of Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De on strategy and tactics, as well as Comrade Liu Shaoqi's 'On the Party' and other famous works. Many of them have been translated into Korean and are used as teaching materials for our cadres." A certain army group specially printed and distributed Chairman Mao's hand-written "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" to the entire army; the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention Song" has become one of the popular songs in the People's Army. The officers and soldiers of the People's Army have gained unlimited confidence because of the joint operations of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and they realize that Stalin and Mao Zedong are the most outstanding strategists in the world today; the Chinese People's Volunteers are armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's strategic thought.

Today, Chairman Mao is known to all the Korean people, and they often greet him and bless him with gratitude and care. Chairman Mao's portraits and commemorative badges with Chairman Mao's image are the most popular gifts among the Korean people. Large portraits of Chairman Mao are hung at all gatherings of the Korean army and people. In many remote villages, in the branches of the Workers' Party and in the homes of farmers, you can see portraits of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao and Stalin and Kim Il-sung's portraits are hung together, kindly watching over the victory of the Korean people. In front of these portraits, you can often hear songs sung in not very proficient Chinese:

"You are the lighthouse, illuminating the ocean before dawn!
You are the helmsman, steering the direction of navigation!..."

### 朝鲜人民热爱毛主席

    朝鲜人民热爱毛主席
    穆欣
    中朝人民反对美国侵略者的共同事业，使素来就洋溢在两国人民间的情谊百倍地增长。中国人民志愿军的出现及其高度国际主义的精神，深深地受到朝鲜人民的感佩。朝鲜人民对于伟大的中华民族的崇敬，对于中国人民志愿军的感激的心情，集中地体现于他们对毛主席的欢呼与热爱。
    今年春天，我刚刚渡过鸭绿江，在远离前线的后方，在公路旁的一片林荫下，忽然听到用中国话唱着“东方红”的歌声；看见一群十岁上下的女孩子走过来，她们高兴地喊着“毛泽东满赛（万岁）”，在那天真的小脸上，浮现着亲切和信赖的颜色，眼睛里放射出敬慕和热爱的光辉。以后，在每一个有朝鲜同志参加的集会上，在那紧靠前线许多被毁的城镇乡村的废墟上，我都曾听见他们使用不很熟练的中国话唱着“东方红”、“没有共产党就没有新中国”，和其他几支祖国最流行的歌。有好多次，我注视着这种感人的景象：歌唱者凝视着远方，声音里充满着衷心的崇敬，眼睛表达出胜利的信心。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜每个地区，都受到最热诚的接待。在大多数场合，由于双方语言不通，朝鲜人民一见到志愿军，就喊“毛泽东万岁”来表达他们的谢意。当志愿军每次在战场上和人民军会师时，部队中就响起“斯大林！毛泽东！金日成！”的一片欢呼声。而在志愿军与人民军、朝鲜老百姓联欢的集会上，人们总是把“东方红”和“光荣归于斯大林”“金日成将军之歌”在一块儿连着唱。
    朝鲜的革命者很早就熟知毛主席，他们从毛主席光辉的著作中，领会到他是他们最可信赖的导师与朋友。今年七月，中国共产党诞生三十周年时，劳动党的一位同志说：“现在看报上说，许多国家正在翻译毛泽东同志的著作，我们朝鲜早就翻译过来了。”毛主席的许多著作都已译成朝鲜文字，各种单行本大量出版，尤以“新民主主义论”、“论联合政府”、“论人民民主专政”等发行最广。劳动党的机关报“劳动新闻”和党的机关杂志“劳动者”月刊，都及时译载毛主席及其亲密战友刘少奇、周恩来、朱德等同志的著述。刘少奇同志“论党”、“论共产党员的修养”，以及“论国际主义与民族主义”等著作，对朝鲜同志有重要的影响。朝鲜劳动党的党员和非党干部都很重视研究毛泽东思想。劳动党党校的中国问题课目中讲授的全是毛主席著作；一般学校中讲到殖民地、半殖民地、民族问题时，也都要讲到毛主席的科学预见和革命理论。我和几位朝鲜作家谈起来，他们都说，毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，给他们指出了正确的创作道路。
        一九四五年“八·一五”以后，朝鲜的革命者不顾美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮的镇压与迫害，在南朝鲜也大量出版过毛主席的著作。一九四七年在汉城出版了“毛泽东选集”。因为毛主席的著作流行广，许多书有好几种译本。当年七、八月美李匪帮反动措施变本加厉，劳动党被迫转入地下，毛主席著作仍继续用秘密的方式出版和销行，甚至在监狱中，被囚禁的革命志士也能看到毛主席的著作，这些著作曾鼓舞了他们的斗争意志。曾被反动派逮捕入狱的劳动党党员柳丑运同志回忆说：他们经常在监狱里学习毛主席的书。另外一位和他在同一时期被捕关进汉城西大门监狱的李光锡同志说：“当时我们每天早晨都要背诵毛泽东同志的‘反对自由主义’一文，总是背完才吃饭。”柳丑运同志是朝鲜的老革命家，前后曾在反动派监狱里过了十八年。他讲十五年前在咸兴监狱里，有一天突然得到中国共产党的“八一宣言”，从中得知关于抗日民族统一战线的主张。他说：“当时我们许多人都很兴奋，比饿了几天见到饭时还高兴。从那时起便更认识到毛泽东同志领导方针的正确与伟大。”
    一九四八年，南朝鲜各地普遍爆发了游击战争，毛主席关于游击战争与战略战术的著作，中国共产党进行游击战争的丰富经验，就成了劳动党人发动和领导游击战争的经典。曾经参加游击战争的朝鲜同志回忆说：党把毛主席这些著作和朱总司令关于游击战争的著作印出来，发给游击队的干部和战士阅读。他们讲到这样的一个故事：在智异山领导游击队的劳动党中央委员、一级国旗勋章获得者李铉相将军，多年来在艰苦的战争中始终带着两本书：一本是“联共党史”，另外一本就是毛主席的“抗日游击战争的战略问题”。李将军已年近五十，他所领导的“李铉相游击队”，是南朝鲜最早建立的游击队之一。活动于庆尚南道、全罗北道和忠清北道，是南朝鲜最大的一块游击根据地。
    在人民军正规部队里，指战员对毛主席的热爱与日俱增。人民军某军官在朝鲜战争周年时向新华社记者说：“现在我们军队中，凡能看懂中国书籍的，都试阅读中国人民领袖毛泽东主席和朱德总司令有关战略战术的著作，以及刘少奇同志的“论党”等名著。其中有许多已翻译成朝鲜文，作为我们干部的教材。”某军团特地把毛主席手订的“三大纪律、八项注意”印发全军；“三大纪律、八项注意歌”已成为人民军中流行歌曲之一。人民军指战员由于中国人民志愿军的并肩作战而增长了无限信心，他们认识到：斯大林、毛泽东是当今世界上最卓越的战略家；中国人民志愿军是用马克思列宁主义与毛泽东战略思想武装起来的。
    今天，毛主席已是朝鲜人民全体所共知的了，他们时常带着感激与关怀的心情问候他，祝福他。毛主席的像片和有毛主席像的纪念章，是朝鲜人民所最欢迎的礼物。朝鲜军队和人民群众的一切集会上，都有毛主席的大幅画像悬挂着。在许多偏僻的村庄，在劳动党支部和农民的家里都可以看到毛主席的画像。毛主席和斯大林、金日成的像挂在一块儿，亲切地注视着朝鲜人民的胜利。在这些画像跟前，时常可以听到用不很熟练的中国话唱的歌声：
   “你是灯塔，照耀着黎明前的海洋！
    你是舵手，掌握着航行的方向！……”（附图片）
