    Sichuan Observations
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ding Xuesong
    Sichuan was fully liberated at the beginning of last year. In this short period of a year and a half, through movements such as suppressing bandits and eliminating local bullies, rent reduction and deposit refunds, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and resisting America and aiding Korea, Sichuan's feudal reactionary forces have been severely hit, and the masses have been mobilized. This time, as I accompanied the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea for Comfort Visits to the Chongqing and Chengdu areas, what I heard and saw deeply impressed me that the urban and rural atmosphere of Sichuan has been completely renewed, quite different from what I saw in Sichuan fifteen years ago. Among them, the following things impressed me the most.
            I. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway
    Along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, we could hear residents singing a song from the bottom of their hearts: "The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway runs trains, everyone laughs and rejoices. Children twist and dance the yangko, and old women watch with smiling faces. Forty years of longing have come true, and the people's country will last for ten thousand years!"
    Their joyous singing has its historical origin.
    The call to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway began in 1906. For more than forty years, successive reactionary rulers used the guise of railway construction to suck the blood and sweat of the people, but did not lay even half a rail. After liberation, in order to build the great southwest, the People's Government, under conditions of numerous tasks and heavy difficulties, decided to start the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and dispatched the People's Liberation Army Southwest Garrison as the vanguard, and also mobilized more than 100,000 unemployed workers and emancipated peasants as the main force of the road construction. Thus, from Chongqing to Chengdu, on the land of undulating mountains, gullies, and a length of 530 kilometers, this magnificent labor army composed of workers, peasants, and soldiers, opened mountains and filled ditches, and launched a heroic struggle against the mountains and rivers. By July 1st of this year, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been opened to traffic from Chongqing to Yongchuan, it can be opened to traffic to Neijiang by the end of the year, and it can be fully completed next year.
    The emancipated peasants of Sichuan actively participated in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as masters of the country. When the government issued the call for road construction, the number of peasants who volunteered to participate in the road construction greatly exceeded the number needed. Originally, sleepers were a major difficulty. Although there are many trees in Sichuan, they are all three to four hundred miles to a thousand miles away from the railway, and felling and transportation are very problematic. However, the government relied on the strength of the peasants and completed all the required sleepers ahead of schedule. When some areas had flash floods that washed the sleepers into the river, the peasants along the river automatically jumped into the river to retrieve the sleepers and send them back to their original location, and not a single sleeper was missing. This year's Spring Festival, the migrant workers broke the customs of previous years and spontaneously initiated "No going home for the Spring Festival." Those peasants who originally planned to get married in the first month also proposed "Not going home until the train is running." Even the dumb Diao Shaozhou, who had not spoken a word for eight years, opened his mouth and said, "I will never go home until the task is completed."
    Diao Shaozhou is a peasant in Yongchuan County. Eight years ago, he bit off his tongue to avoid being drafted into the army and became mute. Although he slowly recovered and could speak, he still pretended to be deaf and mute and never spoke. After liberation, he received a series of benefits, and he also personally saw the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army leading the way in road construction and the cadres of the People's Government personally leading the migrant workers in opening mountains and digging earth, and he was deeply moved. At a team meeting, he suddenly spoke and said, "I will never go home until the task is completed. The world has been turned upside down, and we poor people dare to speak today." Now he is a model migrant worker and a representative of the county migrant workers' representative conference. He often says to people, "The Communist Party is the parents of us poor people."
    In the course of road construction, the migrant workers also showed amazing wisdom. At first, they didn't know how to open mountains, set off cannons, or strike hammers. Now, not only can everyone exceed the standard workload every day, but they have also created many new records. For example, Yan Shaogui, a master of drilling blast holes, can drill 24 meters of blast holes a day, which is six times more efficient than the average person. Xie Quanjia's team invented a new blasting method, which can save six taels of explosives per cubic meter of rock. Their creations and inventions have saved a huge amount of manpower and materials for the road construction project. Engineer Lu, who had participated in the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway survey and planning work before liberation, said with emotion, "What could not be done in the past with so much money and time can now be done with less money and time."
    Sichuan peasants are not only enthusiastic about road construction, but also enthusiastic about road protection. I saw many road protection team members on the Yu-Yong line. Among them are young and middle-aged men, young women carrying babies on their backs, and old women with bound feet in their fifties. They guarded their railway in shifts day and night. An old road protection woman said to me, "Before American imperialism is eliminated, we must strictly guard against the sabotage of bandits and secret agents." Their slogan is: "Not to lose a single rail spike." The women's road protection team members often sweep the long roadbed as clean as their own homes, sort out the ballast, clean the ditches, and pull out any weeds they see by the side of the road. Li Wangshi of Jianshe Village, Renhe Township, Ba County, was patrolling the railway on May 13 when it was raining heavily. She found that the embankment at 24 kilometers and 200 meters had collapsed and the rails were suspended in the air. She hurriedly gathered other team members, and while notifying the locomotive depot, she ran towards the direction of the oncoming train, and thus stopped the train from afar, avoiding an accident. The Sichuan people's love for trains and railways is very natural, because they have been longing for them for more than forty years, but it was not until today, until after the establishment of the People's Government, that they really saw trains speeding between the Bashan and Shu rivers. Therefore, we can also hear such songs everywhere along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway: "The People's Government loves the people! The kindness of the Communist Party cannot be described!" "The people's railway is built by the people! The people's railway is protected by the people! The people's country will last for ten thousand years..."
            II. An Ordinary County
    Forty miles from Chengdu, there is a new county with a population of 110,000 called Xinfan. Before liberation, this was a den of bandits, and on average, one hundred ordinary people had to support two and a half "banglaoers" (i.e., bandits) on a regular basis. Every evening, peasants from the surrounding villages would bring their cattle to the city for the night, because the city was more populous and powerful, and the risk of being robbed was slightly less, so the county town was also known as "cow pen." In Xinfan County, 12 percent of the people were coerced and deceived into joining the Gelaohui secret society. There were four major despots in the county who colluded with bandits and secret societies... In the past, people lived in suffering, but today all this has completely changed.
    The day we arrived in Xinfan County was at sunset. I saw on the roads around the county town (rural roads built by the peasants themselves after liberation), peasants and peasant women wearing new cloth clothes walking home from the market in the city in twos and threes. In the baskets, back baskets, and chicken carts they were carrying, were all kinds of necessities for production and life bought from the city. They had money bags hanging around their waists. They walked home, talking and laughing freely, no longer worried about being robbed by bandits. According to County Chief Cao, since the rent reduction and deposit refund, the public and private shops in the city have been booming. Blacksmith shops and farm implement shops have increased. The state-owned department store used to sell 300,000 to 400,000 yuan a day, but now it sells an average of 3 to 4 million yuan a day, and goods are often in short supply.
    The western Sichuan plain was originally the richest area in Sichuan, but this year's situation is even more special. In the boundless green rice fields, the rice seedlings are dense and strong. The peasants talked leisurely: "Chairman Mao has come, and the sky has changed. This year's crops are the best in more than a decade. At least fifty more catties of grain will be harvested per mu." County Chief Cao told us that after the rent reduction and deposit refund, the peasants in the county received an average of 395 catties of rice as the fruits of victory. The peasants invested 37 percent of these fruits of victory in production. This year, the county bought a total of 335 head of cattle, more than 42,000 pieces of agricultural implements, more than 1 million catties of fertilizer, and more than 9,000 pigs. The fields this year were ploughed two inches deeper than last year, and twice as much fertilizer was applied. The government's leadership was also very timely. In the past, based on the peasants' experience, they would not start transplanting rice until the night-blooming cereus was in full bloom. This year, they transplanted 30 to 40 percent of the rice when the night-blooming cereus was just beginning to bloom. The government led the construction of water conservancy projects, and the peasants also automatically dug ditches and canals. This year, Xinfan County dug a total of 73 large and small ditches and canals. This year, a widespread pest control campaign was also launched. These are the reasons for this year's bumper harvest.
    With the rise of economic life, the peasants' cultural demands have also increased. The number of children enrolled in school this year has doubled compared with the year before; the adult reading groups and literacy classes are also expanding and developing day by day.
    Such a good life needs to be well defended. After the three major calls of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea were issued on June 1, the people of Xinfan County quickly launched a campaign to increase production and donate. The county's leading organs initially estimated that the county could donate one artillery piece, but after discussions at the county people's representative conference and among the peasants in the villages, the peasants unanimously wanted to donate a fighter plane. Their reason was that the grain produced this year alone exceeded the value of a fighter plane, and they also made additional plans to increase production and donate, such as women replacing men in the fields to pick out weeds, men pushing carts, weaving rain hats, straw hats, straw sandals, and raising more livestock. They said, "Now the government thinks of everything very carefully when it makes a call. We can donate without emptying our pockets, and instead increase our income."
    Xinfan County is just an ordinary county among the dozens of counties in western Sichuan. From here, I saw the new face of the emancipated peasants in the new area.
    III. Study Sessions Replace "Dragon Gate Arrays"
    In the past, Sichuan people liked to sit in teahouses and set up "dragon gate arrays," sitting in the teahouse with a pipe in their hands when they had nothing to do, talking about everything from ancient and modern times, Chinese and foreign countries, firewood, rice, oil, and salt, to the shortcomings of Zhang and the virtues of Li... endlessly. This time, in Chongqing, I saw that there were not many teahouses, and even fewer people sitting idly in teahouses setting up "dragon gate arrays." But I saw another phenomenon.
    The nights in Chongqing in July are unusually hot and humid. After 9 o'clock, I was walking on the street and saw that the cultural and educational halls and the streets and alleys were full of people, some listening to lectures and some holding discussions. According to comrades from the cultural and educational hall, the number of students participating in social education classes in Chongqing is now more than the number of students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Every day (it is said that from August it will be changed to twice a week) after dinner, they move their stools and automatically gather to wait for the teachers to come to class. Some working people, because of the difficulty of getting kerosene for lamps at home, still sit under the street lights to learn to write after 11 o'clock. In addition to social education classes, they also use speech contests, political tests, and blackboard newspapers to carry out education, thereby clarifying some confused ideas among the citizens.
    The content of their study is coordinated with current events and political tasks. For example, in July, they studied the three major calls of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea (in coordination with the communication reports of the delegation to Korea for comfort visits), the 30th anniversary of the Party, and the "August 1" Army Day.
    When the representatives of the returning volunteers, Ji Bingqian and others, reported in various parts of Sichuan, many peasants often came from more than a hundred miles away to listen to the lectures. When the representatives of the comfort delegation to Korea went to make communication reports, they came to welcome them with gongs and drums and yangko dances with great interest, and listened to the reports for two or three hours in the hot sun. Not only were they very orderly during the meetings, but they also sang enthusiastically when the meetings were over. I saw an old woman in her fifties also singing "Heroic and High-spirited" and the Internationale.
    In the suburbs of Chengdu, I met an old woman in her forties or fifties who stopped passers-by and asked: What does "resisting America," "aiding Korea," and "American paper tiger" mean. If the person being asked could not answer, she would enthusiastically explain it to him.
        IV. Seeing the Sky After the Clouds Have Cleared, Thanking Chairman Mao!
    This year's "March 8" International Women's Day, women in various parts of Sichuan generally held an unprecedented demonstration parade, with nearly 400,000 people participating in Chongqing City alone. Among them were nuns, believers, and nuns, as well as old women in their seventies and eighties.
    In the liquidation struggle, the women ruthlessly struggled against the landlords and despots. They not only united the women in their own camps very closely, but also educated the women of the landlords and despots, asking them to perform meritorious service for the people. As a result, many wives or daughters of landlords, despots, and even bandits were mobilized to struggle against their husbands or fathers, and to confess the secrets of their families. In the bitterness-speaking movement, women, because they suffered the most in the past, had the most touching content in their accusations. Li Qingyun in the Seventh District of Chongqing gave birth to a total of eighteen children, but in order to squeeze milk for the children of the landlord, seventeen of her own children starved to death. When she accused the landlord of squeezing her milk dry and forcing her to starve her own children to death without even paying her wages, who could not be angry?
    Through various struggles, the women of Sichuan have been organized. Almost all adult women have joined the Women's Federation; women members account for 40 percent of the peasant associations; women account for one-third of the members of the armed self-defense forces. Like men, they hold guns and stand guard, and capture bandits. In Xinfan County, I met Huang Chuanxiu, a famous female hero in western Sichuan who suppressed bandits, the chairman of the Fanjiang Township Peasant Association, and the captain of the county women's armed self-defense force. In the movement to eliminate bandits, eliminate local despots, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, she led the female self-defense team members to assist the government in capturing 48 secret agents and bandits. She once led the militiamen in a rainy night to chase five or sixty miles away and capture six bandits and secret agents. After these bandits and secret agents were publicly tried and sentenced by the government, she carried out the execution by shooting. From Xinfan to Chengdu, you can see female self-defense team members carrying guns and wearing bullet belts across their chests on guard along the way.
    The Sichuan women after emancipation have dispelled the dependent idea of "marrying a man for clothes and food." In production and learning, many heroes have emerged. During this year's spring ploughing, many women learned to plough the fields; during transplanting, they organized collective transplanting teams. The female workers in the factory are also constantly improving their skills. They are learning culture as greedily as hungry and thirsty people. The number of women participating in social education classes in Chongqing City has reached 340,000. Women account for more than 60 percent of the members of rural reading groups and literacy classes. Chen Huiru, a 51-year-old worker's family member, began studying in April last year. On this year's "March 8" International Women's Day, she was already able to write articles for the "Chongqing Women" magazine.
    The women of Sichuan have automatically broken down superstitions. They removed the shrines and Bodhisattvas and pasted pictures of Chairman Mao. They pointed to these Bodhisattvas and said, "I have worshipped you for a lifetime, but I have not received any benefits; today, as soon as Chairman Mao came, we saw the sky after the clouds cleared, and we really turned ourselves over." Now, in the vast areas of the southwest, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have become an inspiring force. At a struggle meeting, a woman was a little timid in front of the broad masses and dared not speak. A woman next to her pushed her and pointed to the image of Chairman Mao and said, "What are you afraid of? With Chairman Mao here, you can just speak boldly!" Another time, in a village, several peasants were arguing over the distribution of the fruits of victory. The director of the peasant association came and said, "Think about it, who gave us the fruits of victory? How can you be worthy of Chairman Mao by arguing like this?..." A few words quelled the dispute.
    Today in Sichuan, if you talk to any working people about their emancipation, they will sincerely tell you: "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we ganren (i.e., poor people) wouldn't have the days we have today!"

### 四川见闻

    四川见闻
    新华社记者  丁雪松
    四川是去年初全部解放的。在这仅仅一年半的时间内，经过剿匪反霸、减租退押、镇压反革命和抗美援朝等运动，四川的封建反动势力已受到沉重的打击，群众亦已发动起来。记者这次随中国人民赴朝慰问团前往重庆、成都一带，耳闻目见，深感四川的城乡气象已焕然一新，与我十五年前所见的四川大不相同。而其中给我印象最深的有以下几件事情。
            一、成渝铁路
    沿成渝路两旁，我们随处可以听到居民从心眼儿里唱出一支歌曲：“成渝铁路跑火车，人人欢笑喜连天。娃儿扭起秧歌舞，老婆婆望着笑颜开。四十年的相思已如愿，人民的江山万万年！”
    他们所以这样欢愉地歌唱，是有它历史的源渊的。
    修筑成渝铁路的呼声，始于一九○六年。四十余年来，历代反动统治利用兴修铁路这一幌子，吮吸着人民的血汗，却没有铺上半根钢轨。解放后不到半年，人民政府为建设大西南，在百端待举、重重困难的条件下，决定动工修筑成渝铁路，并派遣人民解放军西南驻军作开路先锋，另外动员了十余万失业工人和翻身农民作为修路的主力。这样，从重庆到成都，在山峦起伏、沟河满布、长达五百三十公里的土地上，这支由工、农、兵组成的声势雄伟的劳动大军，开山填渠，对山岭和江河展开了英勇的斗争。到今年七月一日，成渝铁路已从重庆通车到永川，年底可以通车到内江，明年就可以全部完成。
    四川翻身农民以主人翁的姿态，积极参加了成渝铁路的修建。当政府发出修路的号召后，自愿参加修路的农民大大超过了需要的人数。原来枕木是一个大困难。四川树林虽多，但离铁路都在三四百里至一千里以外，砍伐和运输很成问题。但政府依靠了农民的力量，提前完成了所需要的全部枕木。当某些地区因山洪暴发将枕木冲到江里去时，沿江的农民自动跳到江里将枕木捞起来送回原地，原来的枕木一根也没有少。今年春节，民工打破了历年的习俗，自动发起“春节不回家”。那些原订正月结婚的农民，也提出“不见火车通车不回家”。连八年未讲过一句话的哑吧刁绍周也开了口，他说：“不完成任务我决不回家。”
    刁绍周是永川县的一个农民，八年前因躲壮丁将舌头咬断，成了哑吧。后虽慢慢痊愈可以讲话了，但他仍装聋作哑，一直没讲过话。解放后，他受到了一连串的好处，在筑路队里又亲眼看见解放军的指战员领头修路，人民政府干部亲自带领民工开山挖土，他深受感动。在一次小组会上他突然发言说：“不完成任务我决不回家，如今的世界翻了底，我们苦命的人今天亦敢讲话了。”现在他是一个模范民工，县民工代表会议的代表。他常对人说：“共产党是我们苦命人儿的爹娘。”
    在修路中，民工们还表现了惊人的智慧。起初，他们开山、放炮、打锤都不会。现在不仅每人每天都能超过标准工，而且还创造了不少新纪录。如打炮眼的能手严绍贵，一人一天能打炮眼二十四公尺，比一般人的效率提高六倍。谢全家小组发明了新放炮法，每公方石头可节省炸药六两。他们的创造和发明，使得修路工程节省了巨大的人力和物资。曾经在解放前参加过成渝铁路勘察计划工作的陆工程师感慨地说：“过去花了多少钱和多少时间作不到的事，现在花的钱和时间不多，事情却作成了。”
    四川农民不仅热心修路，而且还热心护路。我在渝永线上看见不少护路队员。他们之中有青壮年的男子，背着娃娃的年青妇女，也有五十多岁的小脚女人。他们夜以继日地轮班守护着自己的铁路。一个护路的老大娘对我说：“在美帝国主义还未消灭的时候，我们要严防土匪特务的破坏。”他们的口号是：“不丢失一个道钉。”妇女护路队员，经常像打扫自己的家园一样把长长的路基打扫得干干净净，整理道碴，清理水沟，见到道旁有一点杂草就拔掉。巴县仁和乡建设村李王氏，在五月十三日下大雨时，她仍在铁道上巡逻。她发现二十四公里二百公尺处，土方下坠，钢轨悬空了。她赶忙召集其他队员，一面通知机务段，一面迎着火车开来的方向跑去，就这样远远地拦住了火车，避免了发生事故。四川人民这样热爱火车和铁路的心情是十分自然的，因为他们已经渴望了四十多年，但直到今天，直到人民政府成立以后，才真正见到火车开始在巴山蜀水之间飞驰。因此，我们在成渝铁路沿线也到处可以听到这样的歌声：“人民政府爱人民呀！共产党的恩情说不完！”“人民的铁路人民修呀！人民的铁路人民护！人民的江山万万年……。”
            二、普通一县
    离成都四十里，有一个十一万人口的新繁县。解放前这里是一个土匪窠子，平均一百个老百姓要经常养两个半“棒老二”（即土匪）。每天傍晚，四乡的农民都把牛牵到城里去过夜，因为城里人多势壮，被抢劫的危险稍少一些，因此县城又名“牛圈”。在新繁县，有百分之十二的人民被胁迫欺骗参加了袍哥会门。县里有与土匪、会门勾结的四大恶霸……。过去人民是生活在苦难中，但今天这一切都完全改变过来了。
    我们到新繁县那天，正是日落西山的时候。我看到县城周围的公路上（解放后农民自己修的乡村公路），三三两两地走着从城里赶集回乡的、穿着新布衣服的农夫和农妇。在他们挑着、背着或推着的箩兜、背兜和鸡公车里，装的是从城里买来的各种生产和生活的必需品。他们的腰里挂着钱袋。他们谈笑自若地走回家去，再不忧虑土匪的抢劫了。据该县曹县长告诉我，自减租退押后，城里的公私商店都生意兴隆。铁匠铺、农具店增加了。国营百货公司过去一天卖三四十万元，现在平均每天要卖三四百万，货物还常常是供不应求。
    川西坝子本来是四川最富庶的地区，但今年的情况更是特别。在一望无际的绿油油的稻田里，稻秧茂密粗壮。农民怡然自得地谈论着：“毛主席来了天也变了。今年的庄稼是十几年来所没有的，一亩田最少要多打五十斤谷子。”曹县长告诉我们，经过减租退押以后，该县农民平均每人得到三百九十五斤米的胜利果实。农民将这些胜利果实的百分之三十七投入了生产。该县今年共买进了耕牛三百三十五头，农具四万二千余件，肥料一百多万斤，猪九千余只。今年的田比去年普遍深耕二寸，多上了一倍的肥料。政府领导也很及时。往年凭农民的经验，要夜合花盛开的时候才开始插秧，今年在夜合花初开时就插了三四成。政府领导兴修水利，农民也自动开沟挖渠。新繁县今年一共开了大小沟渠七十三条。今年还普遍展开了灭虫运动。这些就是今年要丰收的原因。
    随着经济生活的上升，农民的文化要求也提高了。该县入学儿童今年比前年增加了一倍；成人的读报组、识字班也在一天天扩大和发展。
    这样的好日子是需要好好保卫的。六月一日抗美援朝总会的三大号召发出后，新繁县的人民很快展开了增产捐献运动。县的领导机关当时估计该县可以捐献一门大炮，但经县人民代表会议和各乡的农民讨论后，农民却一致要捐献一架战斗机。他们的理由是，仅靠今年地里增产的粮食已超过一架战斗机的数字，并且他们每家又另订了增产捐献计划，如女人代替男人下田择稗子，男人推车，编?笠、草帽、草鞋，多养家畜等。他们说：“现在政府提出每一个号召都想得顶周到，既捐献了，又不掏腰包，反倒增加了收入。”
    新繁县不过是川西几十个县份中的一个普通的县。我从这里看到了新区翻身农民的新的面貌。
    三、学习会代替了“龙门阵”
    过去，四川人爱坐茶馆，摆“龙门阵”，没有事抱着烟杆往茶馆一坐，古今中外、柴米油盐、张长李短……摆个不休。这次我在重庆，看见茶馆不多了，闲坐在茶馆里摆“龙门阵”的人更少。但我却看见另一种现象。
    重庆的七月之夜，异常闷热。九点以后我在街上散步，还看见文教馆和大街小巷的街沿上坐满了人，他们有的在听讲，有的在开讨论会。据文教馆的同志谈：现在重庆参加社教班的学员，比大、中、小学的学生还多。他们在每天（据说从八月起要改为每周两次）晚饭后，就搬着凳子自动集合起来等教员上课。有些劳动群众因家里灯油困难，十一点以后还坐在路灯下学写字。除社教班外，他们还用讲演竞赛、政治测验、黑板报等方式进行教育，由此澄清了市民中的某些糊涂思想。
    他们学习的内容，是与时事和政治任务相配合的。如七月份内他们学习了抗美援朝总会的三大号召（配合赴朝慰问团的传达报告）、党的三十周年和“八一”建军节等问题。
    当志愿军归国代表嵇炳前等在四川各地报告时，许多农民常常是从一百多里外赶来听讲。当赴朝慰问团的代表去作传达报告时，他们兴致勃勃地打着锣鼓、扭着秧歌赶来欢迎，并在大太阳下听两三个钟头的报告。他们不仅在开会时很守秩序，散会时还热情地唱歌。我曾看到五十多岁的老大娘也在唱“雄纠纠气昂昂”和国际歌。
    在成都郊外，我曾碰见一位四五十岁的大娘，遇见过路的行人，她就拦住问：什么叫“抗美”、“援朝”和“美国纸老虎”。如果被问者答不出来，她就给他热心地解释一遍。
        四、拨云见天，感谢毛主席！
    今年“三八”节，四川各地妇女普遍举行了一次空前的示威大游行，仅重庆市就有近四十万人参加。其中有尼姑、教徒和修女，亦有七、八十岁的老太婆。
    在清算斗争中，妇女们对地主恶霸毫不留情地作了斗争。她们不但把自己阵营的妇女团结得很紧，而且还对地主恶霸家的女人进行教育，要她们为人民立功。因而许多地主、恶霸乃至土匪的老婆或女儿被动员起来向她们的丈夫或父亲进行斗争，坦白出自己家里的隐秘。在诉苦运动中，妇女因为过去受苦最多，因此控诉的内容亦最感人。重庆七区李庆云一共生了十八个娃儿，但是为了给地主的孩子挤奶，把自己的娃儿饿死了十七个。当她控诉地主在挤干了她的奶，迫她饿死了自己的娃儿而竟不给工钱时，谁能不愤怒呢。
    经过各种斗争，四川的妇女组织起来了。成年的妇女差不多全参加了妇联会；农会里有百分之四十的女会员；武装自卫队队员中三分之一是妇女。她们与男人一样，持枪放哨，捉拿土匪。在新繁县，我会见了川西著名的剿匪女英雄、繁江镇农会主席、县妇女武装自卫队的大队长黄传秀。在清匪、反霸与镇压反革命运动中，她领导女自卫队员，协助政府擒获了四十八名特务土匪。她曾经在一个雨夜里，亲自带着民兵追赶到五六十里路外抓回了六个土匪、特务。这几个土匪、特务经过公审和政府判决后，由她执行了枪决。从新繁到成都，沿途都可以看见背着枪、胸前挂着子弹带的女自卫队员在放哨。
    翻身后的四川妇女，打消了“嫁汉嫁汉穿衣吃饭”的依赖思想。在生产和学习中，涌现了不少英雄。今年春耕时，许多妇女学着犁田；插秧时她们组织了集体插秧队。工厂的女工也不断提高着技术。她们像饥渴者一样贪婪地学习着文化。重庆市参加社教班的妇女已达三十四万人。农村读报组和识字班的成员中，妇女占了百分之六十以上。五十一岁的工属陈慧如去年四月开始学习，今年“三八”节时，她已能给“重庆妇女”杂志写稿。
    四川妇女已自动破除了迷信。她们把神龛和菩萨撤掉贴上毛主席的像片。她们指着这些菩萨说：“我供了你一辈子，但没得到一点好处；今天毛主席一来我们就拨云见天，真正翻了身。”现在，在西南的广大地区，共产党和毛主席已成为鼓舞人心的力量。在一次斗争会上，一个妇女面对着广大人群有点胆怯，不敢讲话，旁边的一个妇女推她一把，指着毛主席的像说：“怕什么，有毛主席在，你只管大胆的说呀！”又有一次在一个村上，几个农民为分配胜利果实争吵起来。农会主任来了，说：“想想看，是谁给我们的胜利果实？你们这样吵对得起毛主席吗？……”几句话就平息了这场纷争。
    今天在四川，你和任何一个劳动人民谈起他们翻身的事，他都会恳切地告诉你：“要不是共产党和毛主席，那有我们干人（即穷人）今天的日子！”
