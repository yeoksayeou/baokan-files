    Red Pine Used as Fuel, Decayed Timber Left to Rot
    Serious Waste of Timber in the Lesser Khingan Mountains Forest Area

To the Editor:

    This summer, we went to the forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains for an internship. In the forest areas of Yichun, Nanyi, and Dailing, we saw some instances of timber wastage:

    In the Nanyi forest area, a lot of logs were felled and piled up in the storage yards, but they couldn't be transported out. After being eroded by rainwater, over time, the surface and heartwood had begun to rot, making them almost unusable for construction. However, the local Forest Industry Bureau, in order to "complete the task" and "clear the storage yard," mixed this kind of timber with good timber and allocated them all to user units. (Editor's note: If this kind of timber can still be used as construction material after removing the decayed parts, the forestry authorities can process it to remove the decay and allocate it to material-needing departments. Material-needing departments should also make the best use of it in the spirit of saving timber.) It is said that even today, a large batch of logs felled during the puppet Manchukuo period are still stored in the Dailing storage yard, left to rot. In the rivers beside the forest railways in the forest area, many thick red pines are also left unattended (because they were too thick and large, causing derailments and being abandoned). If someone were to count the amount of wood rotting in the northeastern forest area, the number would be astonishing.

    In various work stations in the forest area, the firewood used for cooking and heating is all good red pine. We felt very uncomfortable when we saw a worker using a large axe to split these woods at a work station. We immediately went to dissuade him, but the worker replied: "There is plenty of wood in the mountains, why not burn the good stuff!" This sentence fully represents the thinking of a significant number of people in the forest area. Indeed, in the forest area, red pine is used to build work sheds, red pine is used for the sleepers of the forest railway, and even red pine boards are used to build a toilet!

    In addition, the logs piled up on the banks of the Nanyi River and Yongcui River in Dailing are often washed away by floods. The residents downstream retrieve them and keep them as their own. This bad habit of "whoever retrieves it owns it" is completely open, and the Forest Industry Bureau is clearly aware of it but does not ask about it.

    Today, the victorious motherland is unfolding economic construction everywhere, and timber is an indispensable building material. However, the forests of the motherland are not as "inexhaustible" as we used to imagine. During this internship, we all saw with our own eyes that the trees on the mountains of the Lesser Khingan Mountains have been almost cut down. Especially in places with convenient transportation, there are no trees left, and even the tops of the mountains are bare, exposing rocks! And the country's afforestation efforts are just beginning, and the days when trees grow into usable timber are still far away. Therefore, we, the students who are determined to devote ourselves to the country's forestry cause, firmly support the State Council's wise decision on saving timber. We hope that the Northeast Forest Industry General Bureau will thoroughly investigate the above facts and strictly prohibit the waste of every inch of the motherland's timber!

### 红松作了燃料陈材任其腐朽  小兴安岭林区严重浪费木材

    红松作了燃料陈材任其腐朽
    小兴安岭林区严重浪费木材编辑同志：
    今年暑假我们到小兴安岭的森林里去实习，在伊春、南义、带岭各林区里看到有一些浪费木材的现象：
    在南义林区里有很多原木被采伐下来，堆集在积材场里，运不出去。经过雨水的浸蚀，日子久了，表面和树心已开始腐烂，差不多不能供建筑用了；而该地森林工业分局为了“完成任务”和“清理积材场”，也就把这种木材搭配在好材里，一齐拨运到使用单位。（编者按：这种木材如去掉腐朽部分以后还可作为建筑器材，林业机关是可以经过加工去腐调拨给需材部门的。需材部门也应本节约木材的精神尽量加以利用。）据说直到今天，在带岭的积材场里还存放着不少的一批伪满时代采伐下来的原木，任它腐烂。在林区的森林铁道旁边的河水里，也遗留着很多的粗大红松（因为太粗太大压翻了车而被遗弃下来的）没人去管。倘若有人将东北林区中所腐烂的木材统计一下，这一笔数字一定是惊人的。
    在林区的各个作业站，煮饭、取暖所烧的木柴，也全是很好的红松。在一个作业站看到一位工人用大斧去劈这些木材时，我们心里十分难受。当时即去劝阻，但那位工人回答说：“山里木头有的是，为啥不烧好的！”这句话充分代表了林区不算小的一批人的思想。事实也是如此，在林区盖一间工棚子是用红松，森林铁路的枕木更是红松，甚至修一个厕所也是用红松板子！
    另外，在带岭的南义河、永翠河两岸堆集的原木，时常因为水大而被冲走。下游的居民打捞上来就归了私人所有。这种谁捞归谁的恶习完全是公开的，森林工业局也明知不问。
    在今天，胜利了的祖国到处正在展开着经济建设，木材是绝不可缺的一部分建筑材料。而祖国的森林，并不像我们以前所想像的那么“取之不尽，用之不竭”。在这次实习中，我们都亲眼看到小兴安岭山上的树木已经采伐得差不多了。尤其是一些交通运输方便的地方，已经没有树了，甚至山顶上光秃秃地露出岩石来了！而国家的造林事业才在开始着手，树木长大成材可以利用的日子又远得很。所以，我们这些立志献身祖国森林事业的学生们，坚决拥护政务院关于节约木材的英明决定。我们希望东北森林工业总局澈底检查以上这些事实，严禁浪费祖国的一寸木材！
