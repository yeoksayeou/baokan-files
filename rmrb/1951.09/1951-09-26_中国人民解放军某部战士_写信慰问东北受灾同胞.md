Editor's Note: Kaiyuan and Tieling counties in Liaoxi Province suffered from floods in mid-August. Recently, Yan Yichang and four other comrades from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army sent a letter of condolence, expressing great concern and sympathy for the compatriots in the Northeast who suffered from the floods. The original letter is published below:

Dear compatriots in the disaster area:

We are all very concerned to read in the newspapers that our compatriots in the Kaiyuan and Tieling areas have suffered from floods. Although the government made great efforts to rescue people during the flood, and later set up many shelters to accommodate the people in the disaster areas, there may still be minor difficulties. We hope that you will not bow your heads in the face of difficulties; you must find various ways to overcome all the difficulties that exist before you. Now the government and the people are allocating and donating clothes, money, and rice to help you. From this, we can see how concerned the Chinese people after liberation are about their compatriots who have suffered disasters. This flood was mainly caused by mountain torrents in the upper reaches of the Liao River, which is also rare in decades. But we believe that floods will gradually decrease in the future. You can understand this by looking at the achievements of the Huai River harnessing project in northern Anhui this year.

Now, in addition to donating a few clothes and shoes, the five of us also hope that we will work together to fight against the enemy who is destroying our construction - American imperialism and natural disasters. Finally, we wish you all the best in overcoming difficulties and rebuilding your homes as soon as possible.

        A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Yan Yichang Liu Binghan Huang Yulin Wu Ximing

    中国人民解放军某部战士
    写信慰问东北受灾同胞
    编者按：辽西省开原、铁岭两县，于八月中旬遭受水灾。中国人民解放军某部，言以昌等五同志最近寄来慰问信一件，对东北遭受水灾的同胞寄以莫大的关怀和同情。现将原信发表如下：亲爱的受灾同胞们：
    从报纸上看到开原和铁岭一带的同胞遭受了洪水的灾害，我们每一个同志都十分关心。虽然政府在洪水泛滥时期，曾经大力抢救，以后又设了许多收容所，收容灾区同胞；但是，小的困难可能还会有，希望你们不要在困难面前低头；要想各种办法，克服眼前所存在的一切困难。现在政府和人民都在拨发和捐献衣服和钱米帮助你们，从这里看出了解放后的中国人民对自己受灾的同胞是多么关心。这次的水灾主要是辽河上游山洪暴发所造成的，也是数十年所少见的。但是我们相信以后水灾是会逐渐减少的。你们看看皖北今年治淮工程的成就，就可以了解到这一点。
    现在我们五个同志除了捐送几件衣服和鞋子外，还希望我们共同努力，向破坏我们建设的敌人——美帝国主义和自然灾害作斗争。最后敬祝你们早日克服困难重整家园。
