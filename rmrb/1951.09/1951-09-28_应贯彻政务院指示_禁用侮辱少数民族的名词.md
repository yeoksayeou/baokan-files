    Should Implement the State Council's Directive
    Ban Terms Insulting Ethnic Minorities

    After the Central People's Government's State Council issued a directive on May 16th this year regarding the handling of terms, place names, steles, and plaques with discriminatory or insulting content towards ethnic minorities, it was warmly supported by ethnic minority compatriots in the Southwest. However, up to this day, some government organs in the southwestern provinces and regions have not given sufficient importance to this directive of the State Council. Some terms and place names with insulting connotations towards ethnic minorities, such as "Woni," "Mahei," and "Pingyi County," are still being used; many works that insult ethnic minorities, such as the "Yunnan Travel Notes" published by Zhonghua Book Company, "Scattered Notes on the Yunnan Border" published by the Commercial Press, and "Southwest Customs and Scenery" published by the Times Book Bureau, and forty or fifty other such books, are still being sold openly. This undesirable phenomenon has aroused dissatisfaction among some ethnic minority compatriots. Therefore, I hope that all localities can thoroughly examine the implementation of the directive issued by the State Council on May 16th this year, formally prohibit or correct those terms, place names, etc., that have insulting connotations towards ethnic minorities; stop selling those books that are still being sold that insult ethnic minorities; so that these behaviors left over from history that harm ethnic feelings and hinder ethnic unity can be thoroughly corrected from now on.

    应贯彻政务院指示
    禁用侮辱少数民族的名词
    今年五月十六日，中央人民政府政务院关于处理带有歧视或侮辱少数民族性质的称谓、地名、碑碣、匾联的指示公布后，西南少数民族同胞热烈拥护。但是，直到今天为止，西南各省区某些政府机关，对于政务院这一指示还没有足够的重视。一些带有侮辱少数民族性质的称谓和地名，如“窝尼”，“麻黑”、“平彝县”等，依然还在继续沿用；许多侮辱少数民族的著作，如中华书局的“云南游记”、商务印书馆的“滇边散记”、时代书局的“西南风情记”等四、五十种，照旧公开出售。这种不良现象，已引起部分少数民族同胞的不满。因此，我希望各地能彻底检查一下执行今年五月十六日政务院颁发的那个指示的情形，把那些带有侮辱少数民族性质的称谓和地名等等，正式予以禁止或改正；停止出售那些尚在继续出售的侮辱少数民族的书籍；使这些历史上遗留下来的有损民族感情、妨害民族团结的行为，从此得到彻底的纠正。
