Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Central People's Government's General Administration of Press and Publication convened the first National Publishing Administration Conference from August 27th to September 4th. Representatives attending the conference included representatives from the General Administration of Press and Publication and the news and publication bureaus of major administrative regions, news and publication offices of provinces (municipalities), representatives from the People's Publishing House, Xinhua Printing Factory, Xinhua Bookstore, and central specialized publishing houses, representatives from the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the propaganda departments of major administrative regions, as well as representatives from relevant central government agencies who were invited to participate.

Ye Shengtao, Deputy Director of the General Administration of Press and Publication, delivered a report entitled "Striving to Improve the Quality of Publications" at the opening of the conference. In summarizing the publishing work of the past year, Deputy Director Ye emphasized the irresponsible and unserious work style currently existing in publishing, which must be earnestly corrected. He called on all publishing workers to strive to improve the quality of publications, to strengthen the publication and distribution of popular reading materials, and to publish a large number of financial and economic, scientific and technological publications to meet the high tide of national economic construction. At the opening of the conference, Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, attended and delivered a speech. He pointed out that the main task of the people's publishing undertaking is ideological struggle. We must thoroughly eliminate old ideas and strive to publicize new ideas. All publishing workers should further improve this work. In the past two years, publications on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have made considerable progress in both quality and quantity, making a significant contribution to ideological reform across the country. We should further strengthen ideological education and further expand the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. To achieve this, we must strengthen the seriousness and planning of the publishing industry.

Deputy Director Ye requested the representatives to prepare the following tasks after returning: First, formulate the publishing plans for the whole province, the whole region, and the whole country for 1952, mainly the topic selection plan; second, strengthen the leadership of public and joint public-private publishing industries and eliminate the current lack of leadership; third, strengthen the leadership and management of private publishing industries and eliminate the speculative phenomena of private publishers and the anarchic and unplanned phenomena of the publishing industry; fourth, pay attention to training publishing cadres; fifth, guide reading campaigns and launch book review work; and sixth, strengthen the system of requesting instructions and reporting.

Deputy Director Ye's concluding report was unanimously approved by all representatives.
