    People's Representative Conferences Must Value Proposals
    Liu Jingxiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government
    Vice Chairman Liu said in his speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing: "If the representative conference discusses and resolves more issues among the people, and if the government committee and consultation committee it elects can faithfully implement the resolutions of the representative conference, then we can imagine that it will further enhance its prestige among the people, and it will have taken a big step forward in the construction of the people's democratic power." This is a very important instruction. During our inspection of several counties in Chahar Province, we deeply felt that whether the People's Representative Conference values the handling of proposals is a crucial aspect of whether the People's Representative Conference can be held successfully.
    In and after the People's Representative Conference, the people generally discuss and earnestly implement state affairs and major tasks of various periods with enthusiasm because this is in line with the people's requirements. This is particularly evident in the work of resisting America, aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. However, this alone cannot satisfy the hopes and demands of the masses, and the handling of people's proposals must also be valued.
    The masses' proposals are a concrete manifestation of the people's enthusiastic reflection of their opinions to the government and their request to solve certain problems. Therefore, even if it is an individual issue, it is a major issue in the lives of the local masses and must be properly resolved in a timely manner. For example, residents of District One of Xuanhua said in a proposal: "When you were fighting guerrilla warfare, you needed us in the mountains, but now that you have come down from the mountains, you have forgotten us." Later, the local people's government sent people to assist them in production and solved their salt shortage, and the local masses said with satisfaction: "Now we have no more opinions!" This not only boosted the enthusiasm of the masses and strengthened the connection between the government and the people, but also enhanced the people's trust in the People's Representative Conference and promoted the people's enthusiasm for managing state affairs. Some counties have paid attention to the handling of proposals, thereby strengthening the role of the People's Representative Conference and the democratic influence of the entire conference.
    However, most counties currently have a bias towards not valuing the proposals of representatives. For example, the people of Dongbali Village in Huailai County have repeatedly requested, through their village representatives, a reasonable solution to the village's water use problem, but the local government has not valued the demands of the masses, resulting in a delay in resolving the issue to this day. The local people are extremely dissatisfied and have stopped submitting proposals ever since. Furthermore, many Hui people in Shacheng in the same county requested to run their own primary school and asked the government to subsidize the start-up costs, which was raised at the People's Representative Conference, but was not resolved, which also had a very negative impact. The result of the People's Representative Conference not valuing the resolution of the people's urgent demands is that the people and representatives become disinterested in the People's Representative Conference, and the number of proposals decreases daily. In Huailai County, since the Third People's Representative Conference exercising the functions of the People's Congress received 381 proposals, the number has decreased repeatedly, and by the Sixth Conference, there were only five or six. (The decrease in proposals, in a certain period, can be said to be a normal phenomenon, because after the government solves a large number of people's problems, the proposals at the People's Representative Conference will decrease accordingly. But this is not the case in Huailai County). The number of attendees has decreased gradually, from 181 at the Third Conference to an estimated less than 100 at the Sixth Conference.
    This situation is exactly as Chairman Mao described in "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work" on January 27, 1934: "After the Tingzhou City Workers' and Peasants' Representative Conference was re-elected, more than 100 representatives, because several meetings only discussed expanding the Red Army and mobilizing transport teams, completely ignoring the lives of the masses, later became unwilling to attend meetings, and the meetings could not be convened. What about expanding the Red Army and mobilizing transport teams? Therefore, there were very few achievements." Here, isn't the historical lesson of the Tingzhou City Workers' and Peasants' Representative Conference precisely what we should be vigilant about and urgently need to correct today?
    In order to respect the people's democratic rights and make the People's Representative Conference truly become the organ of power for the people to manage the affairs of the state and their own affairs, at each People's Representative Conference, in addition to resolving the central topics, appropriate handling and explanation must be given to the proposals of the people's representatives. Neglecting the handling of the people's proposals is as wrong as neglecting the discussion of the government's central tasks. Proposals of an inquiry nature should be explained; those that need to be specifically resolved or requested for instructions should be resolved after the meeting, in addition to explaining them at the meeting, and the results of the resolution should be notified to the representatives at any time; proposals that cannot be handled or need to be postponed must also be explained to the representatives, and the Standing Committee should frequently contact the representatives, absorb the opinions of the people's representatives, and actively and frequently resolve them. Only in this way can we continuously increase the enthusiasm of the people to manage state affairs, strengthen the connection between the government and the people, and consolidate the People's Representative Conference to move towards institutionalization.

### 人民代表会议必须重视提案

    人民代表会议必须重视提案
    中央人民政府内务部秘书处长  刘敬修
    刘副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话中说：“如果代表会议又讨论了和解决了人民中间更多的问题，它所选举的政府委员会和协商委员会又能忠实履行代表会议的决议，那末，我们就可以想象：它将在人民中更加提高自己的威信，它在人民民主政权的建设过程中就已前进了一大步”。这是一个十分重要的指示。我们这次到察哈尔省几个县视察，深感人民代表会议是否重视提案的处理，乃是人民代表会议能否开好的一个重要环节。
    在人民代表会议中及会议后，人民对于国家的事务和各个时期的重大工作，一般是热情讨论认真执行的；因为这是符合人民要求的；特别在抗美援朝、镇压反革命工作中，表现得异常明显。但仅仅如此并不能满足群众的希望和要求，还须重视人民提案的处理。
    群众的提案，是人民向政府热情反映自己的意见，要求解决某种问题的具体表现，因此即使是个别问题，但在当地群众生活中却是一个大问题，必须及时地予以适当解决。例如宣化一区居民在提案中说：“过去打游击的时候，你们在山上要我们，现在你们下了山就忘了我们。”以后当地人民政府派人协助他们生产，并解决了他们的食盐困难，当地群众满意地说：“现在我们没意见了！”这样不但鼓舞了群众的热情，密切了政府与人民之间的联系，而且增强了人民对人民代表会议的信任，促进了人民管理国家事务的积极性。一部分县注意了提案的处理，从而加强了人民代表会议的作用和整个会议的民主影响。
    但目前大部县份存在着不重视代表的提案偏向。例如怀来县东八里村人民，数度通过本村代表要求合理解决该村的用水问题，可是当地政府没有重视群众的要求，以致延搁至今未能解决。当地人民极为不满，从此以后就不再提提案了。又如该县沙城有很多回民曾要求自办小学，请求政府补助开办费，在人民代表会议上提出，结果亦未得到解决，影响也很不好。人民代表会议不重视解决人民迫切要求的结果，就使人民和代表对人民代表会议不感兴趣，提案日见减少。怀来县自从第三次人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权收到三八一件提案后，便迭次减少，到第六次会议时只有五、六件了。（提案的减少，在一定的时期，可以说是正常的现象，因为政府大量地解决人民的问题以后，人民代表会议上的提案自会相应减少。但怀来县的情况就不是这样）。出席人数，逐次减少，第三次会议为一八一人，第六次会议的人数据估计将不到百人。
    这种情况恰像毛主席于一九三四年一月二十七日在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”中所述：“汀州市工农代表会议改选了以后，一百多个代表，因为几次会都只讨论扩大红军和动员运输队，完全不理群众生活，后来就不高兴到会了，会议也召集不成了。扩大红军，动员运输队呢？因此也就极少成绩”。在这里，汀州市工农代表会议的历史教训，不正是我们今天应该警惕和急需纠正的吗？
    为了尊重人民民主权利，使人民代表会议真正成为人民管理国家和自己事务的权力机关，在每次人民代表会议上，除解决中心议题外，对于人民代表的提案必须做适当的处理和交代，忽视人民提案的处理和忽视政府中心任务的讨论同样是不对的。提案属于询问性质者应给予解释；需要具体解决或请示处理者，除在会上说明外，并于会后进行解决，把解决的结果随时通知代表；对不能办理或须缓办的提案，也须向代表说明原委，交代清楚，并使常务委员会经常地与代表取得联系，吸收人民代表的意见，主动地经常地给予解决。这样才能不断地增进人民管理国家事务的积极性，加强政府与人民的联系，巩固人民代表会议使之向制度化方向迈进。
