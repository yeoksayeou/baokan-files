Answering Readers' Questions About the Korean Armistice Negotiations

(1) Question: What is the current situation of the Korean armistice negotiations?

Answer: The Korean armistice negotiations have been suspended for more than ten days since August 23.

The suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations was entirely caused by a series of provocative actions planned by the American side. On August 19, a group of armed personnel from the American and Rhee bandit troops illegally infiltrated the Kaesong neutral zone, attacked our military police responsible for guarding the Kaesong neutral zone, shot and killed Yao Qingxiang, the platoon leader of our military police, and seriously wounded Wang Renyuan, one of our soldiers. After General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, lodged a serious protest against this despicable murder by the American side on the same day, the American side not only refused to provide a reasonable solution to this incident, but also further invaded the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone with aircraft on the night of August 22, bombing and strafing our delegation's residence. This was a more serious provocative incident than the August 19 incident, and it showed that the American side had decided to sabotage the progress of the Korean armistice negotiations. Under these circumstances, the Korean armistice negotiations could not, in fact, continue, so our delegation had to announce the suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations from August 23, to await a responsible handling of this serious incident by the American side.

Although our side has repeatedly urged the American side to quickly handle these two incidents responsibly, the American side still insists on an arrogant and unreasonable attitude, refusing to provide a responsible solution to these two incidents, and is intensifying its provocative actions. On the morning of August 25 and at 6:00 a.m. on August 30, armed personnel of the US and Rhee bandit troops again attacked the Kaesong neutral zone, and murdered our military police Yang Xianzhe and Zhang Renfeng and seriously wounded our military police Zheng Zhongnan in the attack on the 30th. American aircraft violated the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone twelve times in the eight days from August 23 to 30, and dropped two bombs over General Nam Il's residence in Bingkudong in the Kaesong neutral zone at 0:30 on September 1. The US side, on the one hand, refused to reasonably resolve the two incidents of August 19 and August 22, and on the other hand, continued to carry out new provocative actions, the purpose of which was obviously to prevent the Korean armistice negotiations from resuming quickly.

(2) Question: Why did the American side adopt such a barbaric method of sabotage against the Korean armistice negotiations?

Answer: The reason why the American side adopted barbaric and despicable means of assassinating our delegation to sabotage and obstruct the Kaesong negotiations is, first, to attempt to create pressure through intimidation and assassination in order to seize Korean territory. From the beginning of the Korean armistice negotiations to the present, the United States has adopted an arrogant, unreasonable, and stubborn attitude. Since the negotiation meeting began to enter substantive discussions on July 26, the United States has proposed to set the military demarcation line between the two sides north of the 38th parallel and deep within our positions, forcing our side to withdraw from its existing positions for a total of approximately 12,000 square kilometers, that is, to allow the United States to seize another 12,000 square kilometers of Korean territory. After this absurd and unreasonable demand was resolutely rejected by our side, the US side carried out crazy provocations outside the meeting, and finally attempted to force our side to submit by means of assassinating our delegation. Second, it is to continue to create a tense atmosphere in Korea and the entire international situation, in order to create pressure on the US Congress and the US puppet countries, forcing the US Congress to pass a huge military budget, forcing the US puppet countries to accept the illegal US-made separate peace treaty with Japan, and forcing them to continue to intensify their arms expansion and war preparations.

(3) Question: Since the American side has adopted such a crazy attitude of sabotage towards the Korean armistice negotiations, what attitude should we adopt?

Answer: We sincerely advocate a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and at the same time, we are prepared for the enemy to break off negotiations. We are not afraid of the enemy breaking off negotiations. In that case, we will force the enemy to accept peace by crushing its offensive. Of course, as long as there is any possibility of resolving the Korean issue through negotiations, we will still strive for this possibility, in order to show the world our utmost sincerity and expose all the despicable and barbaric bandit behavior of American imperialism. This will make the American side more politically isolated, and will make the peace-loving Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world more clearly recognize the true face of the American aggressors as being hostile to peace and disregarding credibility, thus enabling us to gain broader sympathy from the people of the world.

(4) Question: Under the circumstances of the American side's crazy sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations, what is our task?

Answer: At present, our task is first and foremost to fully expose the truth of the American aggressors' crazy and shameless sabotage of the Korean negotiations to the people of the country and the world, so that the people of the country and the world can more clearly recognize that American imperialism is an irreconcilable enemy of the Chinese and world people. The US side may launch larger-scale provocative offensives and crazy aggression at any time. Therefore, the most important task of our people is to fully strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, fully support the solemn stance adhered to by the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the negotiations, and implement the call of the joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations to achieve the goal of defeating the American aggressors through long-term struggle.

### 关于朝鲜停战谈判答读者问

    关于朝鲜停战谈判答读者问
    （一）问：现在朝鲜停战谈判的情况怎样？
    答：朝鲜停战谈判从八月二十三日以来，已经停顿十多天了。
    朝鲜停战谈判的停顿，完全是美国方面有计划地用一连串的挑衅行动所造成的。八月十九日，美李匪军的一部分武装人员非法潜入开城中立区，袭击担任开城中立区警卫任务的我方军事警察，枪杀我方军事警察排长姚庆祥，重伤我方战士王仁元。当日，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军对于美国方面这一卑鄙的谋杀行为提出严重抗议以后，美国方面不但拒绝对这一事件作合理的解决，且更进一步于八月二十二日夜以飞机侵入开城中立区上空，以我方代表团住址为目标，肆行轰炸与扫射。这是比八月十九日的事件更严重的一次挑衅事件，它表明了美国方面已决心破坏朝鲜停战谈判的进行。在这种情形下，朝鲜停战谈判事实上已无法继续下去，因此，我方代表团乃不得不宣布朝鲜停战谈判会议从八月二十三日起停会，以等待美国方面对这一严重的事件作负责的处理。
    虽然我方曾一再督促美国方面对这两次事件迅速作负责的处理，但美国方面至今仍坚持蛮横无理的态度，拒绝对这两次事件作负责的解决，而且，还在变本加厉地继续它的挑衅行动。八月二十五日晨及三十日上午六时美、李匪军武装人员又袭击了开城中立区，并于三十日的袭击中谋杀了我方军事警察杨显泽与张仁凤，重伤我方军事警察郑重男。美国飞机在八月二十三日至三十日的八天中又连续十二次侵犯开城中立区上空，并于九月一日零时三十分又一次在开城中立区冰库洞南日将军住所上空投弹两枚。美国方面一方面拒绝合理解决八月十九日和二十二日夜两次事件，一方面又不断出以新的挑衅行动，其目的显然是为了使朝鲜停战谈判无法迅速恢复进行。
        （二）问：美国方面为什么要对朝鲜停战谈判采取这种野蛮的破坏办法呢？
    答：美国方面所以采取谋杀我方代表团的野蛮卑鄙的手段来破坏和阻挠开城谈判，第一，就是妄想用恫吓和谋杀的手段来造成压力，掠取朝鲜的领土。从朝鲜停战谈判开始到现在，美国一直采取蛮横无理，又臭又硬的态度，自七月二十六日谈判会议开始进入实质问题的讨论以后，美国就提出要把双方军事分界线设在三八线以北深入我方阵地以内，使我方退出现有阵地共约一万二千余方公里，也就是使美国再夺取朝鲜领土一万二千方公里的极端荒谬的要求。在这种荒谬无理的要求受到我方坚决拒绝以后，美方就在会外施行疯狂挑衅，最后竟以谋杀我方代表团的手段，企图迫使我方屈服。第二，就是要继续造成朝鲜和整个国际局势的紧张空气，来造成对美国国会和美国仆从国家的压力，迫使美国国会通过庞大的军事预算，迫使美国仆从国家接受非法的美制对日和约，并迫使他们继续加紧扩军备战。
        （三）问：美国方面既然对朝鲜停战谈判采取这种疯狂的破坏态度，我们应当采取什么态度呢？
    答：我们是真诚地主张朝鲜问题和平解决的，同时我们也准备敌人破裂谈判。我们是不怕敌人破裂谈判的，在那种情形下我们要以粉碎敌人的进攻来迫使敌人接受和平。当然，只要还有任何以谈判方式来解决朝鲜问题的可能，我们就仍然争取这种可能，以便向全世界表示我们的仁至义尽的态度，并且暴露美帝国主义的一切卑鄙野蛮的强盗行为。这将造成美国方面在政治上更加孤立，会使爱好和平的中朝人民和全世界人民更加认清美国侵略者仇视和平不顾信义的真面目，因而会使我们获得全世界人民更加广泛的同情。
    （四）问：在美国疯狂破坏朝鲜停战谈判的情况下，我们的任务是什么？
    答：目前我们的任务，首先就是要在全国和全世界人民的面前尽情揭露美国侵略者疯狂无耻地破坏朝鲜谈判的真相，使全国和全世界的人民都能更清楚地认识美国帝国主义是中国和世界人民不可调和的敌人。美方随时都有可能发动更大规模的挑衅进攻和疯狂侵略，因此，我们全国人民最重要的任务，就是全力加强抗美援朝运动，全力支持朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团在谈判中所坚持的严正立场，并执行各民主党派各人民团体联合宣言的号召，以长期的奋斗来达到击溃美国侵略者的目的。
