    [This newspaper report] The Beijing Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the Beijing Democratic Youth Federation, and the Beijing Student Federation jointly held a welcome rally at the Working People's Cultural Palace on the 16th to welcome the Chinese Youth Delegation returning from the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival. More than 5,000 youth representatives from all walks of life in the capital attended.

    The meeting began with a welcome speech by Yang Bozhen, Secretary of the Beijing Committee of the Youth League. He expressed warm welcome and respect to the delegation members who had returned victoriously on behalf of the youth from all walks of life in the capital.

    Feng Wenbin, leader of the Chinese Youth Delegation, reported on the delegation's participation in the festival. He said: The delegation shouldered the glorious mission given by the youth and people of the whole country. The delegation told youth friends all over the world about the contribution Chinese youth have made to world peace, and the firm determination of Chinese youth to unite with youth all over the world and contribute all their strength to defend peace; at the same time, the delegation saw the great strength of youth all over the world in defending peace, saw the great progress and efforts of German youth, and exchanged experiences in the struggle to defend peace with them. This has greatly strengthened the friendship and unity between Chinese youth and youth all over the world. We are firmly convinced that the struggle of youth all over the world to defend peace will surely achieve final victory.

    Comrade Feng Wenbin described the deep friendship and respect expressed by youth all over the world for Chinese youth during the festival. He said: At every celebration, the names of "Stalin" and "Mao Zedong" aroused long applause and cheers. The artistic performances of Chinese youth also won lofty honors. In the literary and artistic competition with the participation of thirty-two countries, the dance of Chinese youth won the first prize, and the composition of "People All Over the World are of One Heart" won the second prize. Because the youth of the whole country and the delegation actively prepared for and participated in the festival with excellent results, they also won the "Unity Award" awarded by the International Committee of the Festival. The delegation also received many gifts from youth from various countries. All the glory and achievements of Chinese youth in the festival should first of all belong to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party who led the Chinese people and Chinese youth to great victory.

    Feng Wenbin then pointed out: The festival is a tremendous victory for youth all over the world in defending peace, and a powerful blow to the evil conspiracy of warmongers who attempt to drag youth into a new world war. He called on the youth of the whole country to strengthen their efforts to defend peace and fulfill their increasingly heavy responsibilities in the cause of world peace.

    After the meeting, the members of the Chinese Young Pioneers team who participated in the "Young Pioneers Republic" camping in Berlin and the Bulgarian children's summer camp performed various wonderful artistic programs.

    中国青年代表团团长冯文彬报告了代表团参加联欢节的经过。他说：代表团肩负全国青年和人民给予的光荣任务。代表团把中国青年对世界和平所作的贡献，以及中国青年愿意和全世界青年团结一致，为保卫和平贡献出自己一切力量的坚强决心，告诉了全世界青年朋友；同时代表团看见了世界青年保卫和平的巨大力量，看见了德国青年伟大的进步和努力，并与他们互相交换了保卫和平的斗争经验。这就大大加强了中国青年和世界青年的友谊与团结。一致坚信全世界青年保卫和平的斗争是一定可以得到最后胜利的。
    冯文彬团长叙述了联欢节中全世界青年对中国青年表示深厚的友谊与尊敬的情形。他说：在每次联欢会上，“斯大林”、“毛泽东”的名字引起长时间的鼓掌和欢呼。中国青年的艺术表演也获得了崇高的荣誉。在三十二个国家参加的文艺竞赛里，中国青年的舞蹈得到了一等奖，“全世界人民心一条”的作曲得了二等奖。因全国青年和代表团积极地筹备和参加联欢节成绩优异，又获得联欢节国际委员会所颁发的“团结奖”。代表团还收到了各国青年送给我们很多的礼物。所有中国青年在联欢节中的光荣和成就，首先应该属于领导中国人民和中国青年获得伟大胜利的毛主席和中国共产党。
    冯文彬团长接着指出：联欢节是全世界青年保卫和平的极巨大的胜利，并予企图把青年拖入新世界大战的战争贩子的罪恶阴谋一次极有力的打击。他号召全国青年加强保卫和平的努力，完成自己在世界和平事业中日益加重的责任。
