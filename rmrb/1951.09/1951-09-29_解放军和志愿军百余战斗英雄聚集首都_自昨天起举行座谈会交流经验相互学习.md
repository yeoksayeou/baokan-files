Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The People's Liberation Army combat hero National Day observation representatives and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army combat hero National Day observation delegation have gathered in the capital, Beijing.

There are ninety-seven Volunteer Army combat heroes and various models, some of whom are combat heroes in combat companies, some are model drivers and model stretcher bearers on the transportation line, and some are model medical workers and model office workers. Among them are Guan Chonggui, a combat hero who killed or wounded more than fifty enemies and shot down an enemy plane in one day; Tan Bingyun, an anti-tank hero who destroyed three enemy tanks and one vehicle in eight hours; Liu Xingwen, a Miao youth combat hero who killed or wounded more than ten enemies in his first battle; Yang Lian, the nationally renowned mountain climbing hero Di; Jiang Shuhua, a model nurse who rescued fifteen wounded soldiers at the risk of enemy aircraft strafing while ill; and Wang Renshan, a model driver who drove safely for 30,000 miles.

There are sixty-one combat heroes and work models from the People's Liberation Army's Army, Air Force, and Navy, including combat heroes, bandit suppression heroes, military industry labor models, troop production models, and learning models. Many of them attended or were present at the National Combat Heroes Representatives Meeting held last year; today, they are coming again with new achievements from the past year to participate in the National Day celebration and to see Chairman Mao, whom they miss. Among these combat heroes are Shen Xu, one of the first tank drivers to be trained and a tank hero who performed meritorious service in the Jinan Campaign; Liu Sihu, the nationally famous bayonet fighting hero; Li Hong, a naval class B learning model who quickly mastered modern technology through hard work and practice; Cheng Yuanmao, a hero of Tashan; and Cai E, a young combat hero.

In the battles, production, learning, and various tasks of the past two years, especially in the construction of a modern national defense force, many new heroes and models have emerged. Naval combat hero Wang Daming once led a small boat on the motherland's sea to disrupt an enemy fleet, and Air Force hero Liu Yaozong participated in the flight that broke through the "air restricted zone" of the Kangzang Plateau. In addition, there are Zhang Qingxiang, a model engineer who participated in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway; Wang Yaorong and Pang Yungao, bandit suppression heroes; Liu Huanqi, an Air Force pilot learning model; and Cui Hanqing, a paratrooper learning model, and others.

The Volunteer Army and People's Liberation Army combat heroes and models have been holding symposiums since today to exchange experiences and learn from each other.
