To the Editor:

    The People's Daily published an article I wrote criticizing the basic construction of the Yangquan Mining Bureau on July 6, 1951. Some parts of this report were inconsistent with the facts.

    The inaccuracies are as follows:

    1. The report stated: "The Fourth Mine built eight workers' dormitories, but all were demolished because another project needed the land." The actual situation is that the other project has not yet started, and the houses have not yet been demolished.

    2. The report stated: "Nearly 1,000 meters of culvert foundations were completely abandoned due to design changes." The fact is that only 196 meters were abandoned.

    3. The report stated: "In 1950, the total additional budget was 4,774,000 catties of millet." In reality, part of this was added due to the increase in projects.

    4. The report stated: "New houses built at the Fourth Mine in the autumn of 1950 collapsed in the spring of this year." The fact is that the partition walls inside the houses collapsed, but the houses did not collapse.

    What is especially serious is that the manuscript was not reviewed by Comrade Wang Jinlin, Secretary of the Yangquan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and I added his name without authorization, which was completely wrong.

    The fundamental reason for the above serious errors is my low level of political thought and the serious individualistic thinking I had when writing the manuscript. When the newspaper called long distance to check the details of the manuscript, I was excited about the publication of the article and still did not consider the adverse consequences of inaccurate reporting. The motivation for the report was incorrect, and there were many shortcomings in the writing process:

    1. I only conducted a general investigation, relying only on hearsay without in-depth interviews.

    2. When looking at the materials, I just skimmed through them without using my brain. For example, the Yangquan Mining Bureau's summary report combined the additional budget and the newly built projects. When I looked at the report, I only saw that the first few items were additional budget projects, and I carelessly copied the total amount, saying that the additional budget was mostly due to waste.

    I should apologize to the readers and the Yangquan Mining Bureau for these inaccuracies in my report.

    Han Yongshou

    Editor's Note: Any information reflected to the Party newspaper must be absolutely true; otherwise, it will damage the Party newspaper's credibility among the people. Although Han Yongshou's report on the basic construction of the Yangquan Mining Bureau was mostly true, some parts were not. The thinking throughout the reporting process was impure. In particular, using the name of the Party Committee Secretary without authorization is not just a matter of ideological style, but a violation of organizational discipline. Comrade Han Yongshou should more thoroughly examine his thinking and correct his mistakes.

### 韩永寿关于阳泉矿务局基本建设报道部分失实的检讨

专栏：读者来信

    韩永寿关于阳泉矿务局基本建设报道部分失实的检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报一九五一年七月六日发表了我写的一篇批评阳泉矿务局基本建设的稿子。这篇报道有些地方与事实不符。
    与事实不符的有以下几点：
    一、报道中说：“四矿修建了八栋工人宿舍，就因另一工程需要这一块地基而全部拆除。”实际情况是另一工程尚未动工，房子还没有拆除。
    二、报道中说：“近千公尺涵洞根基，也因设计改变而全部废弃。”事实是只有一百九十六公尺废弃。
    三、报道中说：一九五○年总共追加预算小米四百七十七万四千斤。实际上其中有一部分是因为增加工程而追加的。
    四、报道中说：“四矿一九五○年秋季建的新房今年春季即有倒塌的。”事实是房子里边的隔墙有倒塌的，房子并未倒塌。
    尤其严重的是该稿并未经中共阳泉区委书记王金林同志看过，我竟擅自加上了他的名字，这是完全不应该的。
    造成上述严重错误的根本原因是我的政治思想水平太低，写稿时有严重的个人主义思想。当报社打来长途电话查对稿件情况时，我只为了稿件能够发表而兴高采烈，仍然没有考虑到不真实的报道所产生的不良后果。报道的动机不正确，在写作过程中就有很多缺点：
    一、只有泛泛地调查，只根据听说的材料，没有深入采访。
    二、看材料时走马看花，没有开动脑筋。比如阳泉矿务局的总结报告是把追加预算和增建的工程写在一起的，我看报告时只看了前几项是追加预算的工程，就马马虎虎地把总数照抄下来，说追加预算大部是因浪费所致。
    我的报道中有这些与事实不符的地方，我应该向读者和阳泉矿务局道歉。
    韩永寿
    编者按：向党报反映任何情况必须绝对真实；不然，就会损害党报在人民中的威信。韩永寿关于阳泉矿务局的基本建设的报道虽然大部分是真实的，可是，也有一些地方是不真实的。就整个报道过程来说，思想是不纯的。特别是冒用党委书记的名义，就不止是一个思想作风问题，而是违犯组织纪律的行为。韩永寿同志应该更澈底地检查自己的思想，改正自己的错误。
