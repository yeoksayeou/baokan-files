Party Life

    The Wuhan Municipal People's Government Party Group, the Health Bureau General Branch Committee, and Communist Party members Song Ying (Deputy Director of the Wuhan Health Bureau) and Zhou Jifang (former Deputy Mayor of Wuhan Municipality) should be punished for suppressing public criticism and seriously violating party organizational discipline.
    The sequence of events is as follows:
    On September 1, 1950, cadres from the medical departments under the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Health Bureau used the pseudonym "Chen Jie" to write a letter to Chairman Mao, exposing a series of errors in the work of Song Ying, the deputy director of the Health Bureau. For example, when Song concurrently served as the director of the Municipal Hospital, she refused to admit acute patients from the southward-bound army, resulting in the deaths of some patients due to lack of medical treatment; and she searched the pockets and dormitories of the hospital's staff and workers. The letter also stated that cadres from various departments under the Health Bureau had raised many opinions about Song Ying's errors in meetings or in writing; and had written letters to the Yangtze River Daily and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, but no action or reply had been seen.
    After receiving this letter of accusation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to be responsible for inspection and handling. The Wuhan Municipal Committee then ordered Song Ying to conduct a self-criticism based on this letter of accusation. Although Song Ying also wrote a self-criticism report, the self-criticism was extremely superficial; and in the self-criticism, she first emphasized her "achievements," such as how the Wuhan municipal health institutions during the takeover period were "incomplete and dilapidated," and how she "grasped the principles of takeover and achieved rapid resumption of work," and so on. Precisely because of this, Song Ying liked praise, not criticism. But under the urging of higher authorities, she had to deal with the self-criticism perfunctorily. So Song Ying made a general self-criticism: "Insufficient reliance on the masses and trust in the masses," "rigid working methods, mechanical execution of systems," "insufficient implementation of a clear class line in work," with the reasons for the errors being "no experience in large-scale medical and political management work," and "bureaucracy and事務ism existed in the work." Finally, she said that these errors "had been reviewed during the democratic inspection last winter" and "had been gradually corrected in the work." After making the above superficial self-criticism, Song Ying made detailed defenses against the discrepancies between Chen Jie's letter of accusation and the facts. She either pushed the responsibility to the objective environment, or said that it did not conform to the facts, or said that it had nothing to do with her. But she avoided talking about some specific facts that could not be refuted, such as the death of acute patients due to cumbersome hospital procedures, the search of staff dormitories, and other serious issues.
    The Wuhan Municipal People's Government Health Bureau General Branch Committee, instead of urging Song Ying to examine and correct these errors and her erroneous attitude of rejecting criticism, made the erroneous decision to "track down the accuser." On October 28th last year, the General Branch Committee called Wang Shouzheng, Ji Kaifu, Ma Jun and other non-party cadres from the Wuhan Second Hospital to the Health Bureau, and used intimidation and other means to try to find out who wrote the letter of accusation. Afterwards, Ji Kaifu and others wrote to the Wuhan Municipal Committee Discipline Inspection Commission to accuse this illegal behavior. Excerpts are as follows:
    "...Director Song Ying, Secretary Chen Gang, Secretary Jiang, Director Zhang Jie, etc. pointed to a letter written to Chairman Mao and said to me: 'You wrote this, right?!' I replied: 'I didn't write this.' Director Zhang immediately said: 'They (referring to Wang Shouzheng, etc.) said you wrote it.' And said: 'You are a member of the Communist Youth League, you must be honest, if you wrote it, you should admit it, it doesn't matter much.' I said: 'I didn't write it. If you don't believe me, you can compare the handwriting.' Director Song said: 'It's not a matter of admitting or not. Young people should be honest, there is no big deal in saying it, at most a general meeting will be held for self-criticism.' I said: 'I can't admit something I didn't do.' They said again: 'You say who wrote it, don't have any worries, don't push it on each other.' In the end, because there was no result in confrontation and questioning, Wang Shouzheng was left in the bureau."
    Wang Shouzheng's report stated:
    "...Director Zhang led me to a room. As soon as I entered the door, Director Song said: 'If you wrote it, you wrote it, why not admit it! You three are pushing Zhang San on Li Si, it's unbelievable, why are you playing this trick on us.' I was about to argue when Director Song said again: 'Don't try to be slick in front of us, we have already understood, don't argue! Don't worry, honestly tell me who wrote it, you have no responsibility at all if you say it.' I asked them to find the witness, and Secretary Jiang readily agreed: 'We can call him immediately.' But Director Song said again: 'What's the use of that, even if the person comes, he won't admit it, isn't that unbelievable?' I said: 'You are all Communist Party members, and you are all our leaders, why are you putting labels on us arbitrarily and biting down on us?' The argument ended without any result."
    Such bad behavior by Song Ying and the Health Bureau General Branch Committee completely violates the central government's regulations: "Party leading organs and cadres at all levels must adopt a warm welcome and firm protection of the revolutionary attitude towards criticism reflecting the opinions of the masses, and oppose the bureaucratic attitude of ignoring, restricting publication, and attacking, retaliating, and ridiculing critics." (Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications). Therefore, when Wang Shouzheng and others accused Song Ying and others of "violating human rights and the law," they said: "Anyone can write a letter to their leader Chairman Mao to report some things and criticize some people. Why are Director Song and others dissatisfied with this and use various means to investigate the writer and force us to admit it?" Finally, they asked to "clear this injustice" and "guarantee human rights."
    Afterwards, although the Health Bureau General Branch Committee also admitted that this was wrong, they did not sufficiently recognize the seriousness of this error, so they did not correct it in fact.
    The Communist Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government also adopted an erroneous attitude towards this matter. After the Song Ying incident was accused, the Wuhan Municipal Committee also instructed the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government that it was necessary to check the work of the Health Bureau. However, as can be seen from the letter of Communist Party member Zhou Jifang (Deputy Mayor of the Wuhan Municipal Government and a member of the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government) to the Wuhan Municipal Committee Discipline Inspection Commission, the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government did not truthfully check the work of the Health Bureau according to the letter of accusation, but avoided the important and focused on the trivial, and vaguely proposed to check the "class line of medical work." The Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government did not, as Stalin said: "Even if the criticism only includes five to ten percent of the truth, then this kind of criticism should also be welcomed, listened to carefully, and grasp its healthy core." Instead, it supported the erroneous behavior of lower-level cadres in suppressing public criticism. Therefore, the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government repeatedly emphasized in its letter to the Wuhan Municipal Committee Discipline Inspection Commission that "we believe that the accusation does not conform to the facts" and "the accuser is not well-intentioned." Although the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government also admitted that "the work of the Health Bureau has shortcomings," it also said: "This letter must not be used as a basis for checking the work of the Health Bureau" and "it is definitely not because someone comes to sue that we come to check." This attitude is obviously wrong. Therefore, it was not until February 28th of this year that an enlarged meeting of the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government was held to check the work of the Health Bureau. It would be more appropriate to say that it was a "defense" rather than a "check." This can be seen from their letter to the Wuhan Municipal Committee Discipline Inspection Commission. First, they said that "the work of the Health Bureau has problems" and "various parties have many opinions on the hospital, but they were not checked in time" and "we should bear a major responsibility." But then they scolded the writer of the letter of accusation and affirmed that this letter of accusation was written by a certain party member. Therefore, they wanted to criticize this "anonymous slander" behavior and threatened that it was "illegal" and that it was "violating the principles of discipline," thereby "legalizing" their erroneous behavior of suppressing criticism. Communist Party members can directly raise their opinions to a certain party member, and they can also accuse a certain party organization or a certain party member of errors to the central government. Even if the anonymous letter was indeed written by a party member, the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government and the General Branch Committee of the Health Bureau should humbly review it. This exactly illustrates that the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government, the General Branch Committee of the Health Bureau, Zhou Jifang, Song Ying and others lack democratic style and have a serious bureaucratic work style.
    Song Ying and the Wuhan Municipal Government Party Group and the Health Bureau General Branch Committee's suppression of public criticism and arrogant attitude of disregarding the party organization, although repeatedly criticized and educated by the Wuhan Municipal Committee, have never seriously conducted a review. It was not until early July of this year that Song Ying reluctantly made a second review after the strict criticism of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China. However, Song Ying still adopted an attitude of resisting criticism in this review. Song Ying said that she "still did not know the reason" why the party organization asked her to make another review, and therefore "could not figure it out" in her thoughts and was "very distressed spiritually." The Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government was still making excuses in its letter of review to the Wuhan Municipal Committee on July 13th. Although Song Ying "has major problems in her work style, she has made great progress since the rectification campaign." It also said: "Everyone (?) cannot figure out the anonymous accusation problem within the party." "If it is said that anonymous accusation is due to a lack of democracy, then party members should also have a fighting spirit." Therefore, they advocated that "criticism should be given to certain party members for their lack of fighting spirit." This erroneous attitude of the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government caused the problem to drag on until mid-August without any result. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to the Wuhan Municipal Committee and its Discipline Inspection Committee on August 16th, asking them to seriously deal with this issue. It specifically pointed out that Song Ying should be given appropriate punishment for violating party discipline; the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Government and the General Branch Committee of the Health Bureau should make a profound written review and report the handling results to the Central China Bureau by the end of August.

    武汉市卫生局副局长宋瑛等严重压制群众批评应受处分
    中共武汉市人民政府党组与卫生局总支委员会、共产党员宋瑛（武汉市卫生局副局长）、周季方（原武汉市人民政府副市长）二同志压制群众批评，严重地违反了党的组织纪律。
    事情的经过是这样的：
    一九五○年九月一日，武汉市人民政府卫生局所属医务部门的干部，曾用“陈颉”这个化名，写信给毛主席，揭露卫生局副局长宋瑛工作上的一连串的错误。如宋兼任市立医院院长时，拒收南下大军急症病员，因而个别病员不及医治而死；并搜查医院职员工人腰包和宿舍等。信中同时说明：卫生局所属各部门干部，对宋瑛的这些错误，曾在会议上或书面提过不少意见；并向长江日报及武汉市人民政府写过信，但都未见处理或答覆。
    中共中央接获此控告信后，即指示中共武汉市委员会负责检查处理。武汉市委员会即令宋瑛根据此控告信进行检讨。虽然宋瑛也写了检讨报告，但检讨极其浮浅；并在检讨中首先强调自己的“功劳”，例如接管时期的武汉市卫生机构，是怎样“残缺不全，破烂不堪”，由于她“掌握了接管原则，作到迅速复工”等等。正因为如此，宋瑛喜欢的是表扬，而不是批评。但在上级督促之下，又不得不应付检讨一下。于是宋瑛笼统地检讨：“依靠群众、信任群众不够”，“工作方式生硬，执行制度机械”，“工作中贯彻明确的阶级路线不够”，错误原因是“对大规模的医政管理工作没有经验”，“工作中存在着官僚主义和事务主义”。最后又说，这些错误“在去冬民主检查时，已作了检讨”，并且“都已在工作中逐渐纠正”。宋瑛在作了上述浮浅的检讨之后，便对陈颉控告信中的与事实有出入的地方，即进行详尽的申辩，她不是将责任推之于客观环境，就是说与事实不符，或者说与自己无关。但对于无法置辩的一些具体事实，例如因医院手续繁琐造成急病员死亡，搜查职工宿舍等等严重问题避而不谈。
    武汉市人民政府卫生局总支委员会，对宋瑛这些错误和拒绝批评的错误态度，不仅不督促宋瑛检讨改正，相反地作出“追查控告人”的错误决定。去年十月二十八日，总支委员会将武汉市第二医院中的非党干部王守正、纪凯夫、马骏等三人叫到卫生局，采用威吓等手段，企图查出写控告信的人。事后，纪凯夫等曾向武汉市委纪律检查委员会写信控告这种违法行为，现摘录如下：
    “……宋瑛局长、陈刚秘书主任、姜秘书、张洁主任等指着一封写给毛主席的信，对我说：‘这是你写的吧？！’我回答说：‘这不是我写的。’张主任立刻说：‘他们（指王守正等）说是你写的。’又说：‘你是青年团员，要老老实实，是你写的就应该承认，没有多大关系。’我说：‘不是我写的。不信，可以对笔迹。’宋局长说：‘不是承认不承认。青年人应该老实，说出来没有多大关系，顶多开个大会检讨检讨。’我说：‘不是我做的事，我是不能承认的。’他们又说：‘你说究竟是谁写的，不要有顾虑，不要互推。’最后因对证、追问无结果，便将王守正留在局里了。”
    王守正的报告中说：
    “……张主任将我引至一室内，一进门，宋局长便说：‘是你写的就是你写的，何必不承认！你们三人张三推李四，活见鬼，何必对我们耍这套把戏。’我正要申辩，宋局长又说：‘不许你在我们面前耍滑头，我们早就明白了，不要辩吧！你不要顾虑，真诚地告诉我是谁写的，说出来你一点责任都没有。’我要求他们找出证明人，姜秘书满口答应：‘可以马上打电话叫他来。’但宋局长却又说：‘那有什么用处，人来了他又不承认，那不是活见鬼吗？’我说：‘你们都是共产党员，又都是我们的领导人，为什么给我们乱戴帽子，一口咬定呢？’争论到最后仍无结果。”
    宋瑛及卫生局总支委员会的这种恶劣行为，完全违背了中央所规定的：“党的各级领导机关和干部必须对于反映群众意见的批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度，而反对对群众批评置之不理、限制发表和对批评者实行打击、报复与嘲笑的官僚主义态度。”（中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定），因此王守正等三人向武汉市委纪律检查委员会控告宋瑛等“违犯人权和法纪”的行为时说：“任何人都可以写信给自己的领袖毛主席，报告一些事情，批评一些人，为什么宋局长等，对这表示不满，并用各种手段追究写信人，逼迫我们承认？”最后他们要求为其“洗此不白之冤”，“给予人权保障”。
    以后，卫生局总支委员会，虽然也承认了这是不对的，但对这一错误的严重性还认识不足，因此并未从事实上来改正。
    武汉市人民政府的共产党党组，对此事也采取了错误的态度。宋瑛被控事件发生后，武汉市委亦曾指示武汉市政府的党组，需要检查卫生局的工作。但是从共产党员周季方（武汉市政府副市长、武汉市政府党组成员之一）给中共武汉市纪律检查委员会的信中可以看出，武汉市政府党组并没有实事求是地按照控告信检查卫生局的工作，而是避重就轻、避实就虚地大而无当地提出要检查“医务工作的阶级路线”。武汉市政府党组，不是按照斯大林所说的：“即令批评只包括着百分之五到百分之十的真理，那么就是这种批评也应该欢迎，细心地倾听，抓住其中健全的核心。”而是支持下级干部的压制群众批评的错误行为。所以武汉市政府党组在给武汉市委纪律检查委员会的信中，一再强调“我们认为控告的与事实不符合”，“控告人不是善意的”。虽然武汉市政府党组也承认“卫生局的工作是有缺点的”。但是又说：“决不能以此信作为检查卫生局工作的凭据”，“决不是因人家来告一状，而就来检查”。这种态度显然是错误的。因此一直拖到今年二月二十八日才召开武汉市政府党组扩大会议，对卫生局工作作了检查。说是“检查”，倒不如说是“申辩”更恰当些。这可以从他们给武汉市委纪律检查委员会的信中看出，先说“卫生局的工作是有毛病的”，“各方面对医院有很多意见，没有及时检查”，“我们应负重大责任”。但是接着对写控告信的人责骂，并肯定地说这封控告信是某党员写的。因此，要批评这种“匿名诬告”的行为，并威吓说这是“不法”的，这是“违反纪律原则”的，借此把自己压制批评的错误行为“合法化”起来。共产党员既可以直接对某一个党员提出自己的意见，又可以向中央控告某一党组织或某一党员的错误，即使写这封匿名信的真是一个党员，武汉市政府党组，卫生局总支委员会亦应虚心检讨。这正说明了武汉市政府党组，卫生局总支委员会、周季方和宋瑛等缺乏民主作风，有严重的官僚主义作风。
    宋瑛及武汉市政府党组、卫生局总支委员会的压制群众批评，无视党组织的傲慢态度，虽经武汉市委会一再批评教育，但始终没有认真地进行检讨。一直拖到今年七月初，宋瑛始在中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会的严格批评之后，勉强作了第二次检讨。但是宋瑛在这次检讨中仍是采取抵抗批评的态度。宋瑛说：她对党组织要她再作检讨“尚不知是何原因”，因而思想上“想不通”，“精神上是十分苦闷的”。武汉市政府党组在七月十三日给武汉市委的检讨信中也仍然是在强词辩解，宋瑛虽然“在作风上有重大毛病，但自整风以后，大有进步”。又说：“对党内匿名控告问题，大家（？）在思想上是闹不通的。”，“如说匿名控告是由于不民主，但党员也应有斗争性。”于是他们主张对某些党员“缺乏斗争精神这一点上应给予批评”。武汉市政府党组这种错误态度，使问题拖延到八月中旬，仍无结果。中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会，于八月十六日又给武汉市委及其纪律检查委员会发出指示，要他们严肃地处理这一问题。并具体指出：对宋瑛违反党的纪律的错误应给予适当的处分；武汉市政府党组、卫生局总支委员会应作出深刻的书面检讨，限期于八月底将处理结果报告中南局。
