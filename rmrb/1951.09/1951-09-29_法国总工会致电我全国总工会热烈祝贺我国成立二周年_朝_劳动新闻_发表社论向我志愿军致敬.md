Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The French General Confederation of Labor's General Secretary, Frachon and Le Leepart, sent a telegram to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to congratulate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The telegram is as follows:

Beijing All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Dear Comrades:

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are very honored to express to you and all Chinese workers the warmest and most friendly congratulations from the French workers.

French workers hope that their Chinese brothers will achieve the greatest success in economic development. They appreciate these successes, because for them, in their daily struggle against class enemies, it is a kind of encouragement.

These successes, coupled with the successes of the workers of the Soviet Union and other People's Republics, and the successes of the workers in imperialist countries who are fighting to protect their economic and social interests and peace, are a powerful contribution to strengthening the forces of the democratic peace camp.

French workers greatly admire the calmness, composure, and determination of the People's China in the face of intensified provocations by the imperialists. They are also strengthening the struggle for human peace, freedom, and independence every day.

On behalf of the French workers, we pay tribute to the heroic Chinese people and their wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the brave soldiers of the People's China. They are fighting with their Korean brothers, with weapons in hand, against the imperialist aggressors; they will surely be victorious. On behalf of the French workers, we pay tribute to the heroes who sacrificed themselves in the struggle for peace and freedom.

Dear Comrades! We assure you: our friendship is indestructible. Finally, we extend our friendly greetings to you!

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 27th entitled "The Korean People's Respect and Love for the Chinese People's Volunteers," stating: The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the just war against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples—the ferocious American imperialist aggressor troops—have been tirelessly displaying heroic spirit together with the Korean People's Army. This has made the Korean people's respect and love for the Chinese People's Volunteers increasingly high.

The editorial wrote: The commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteers, armed with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, have consistently demonstrated iron-like conscious discipline and noble moral qualities. Therefore, from the very first day of welcoming the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people, with supreme gratitude and respect, unanimously rose up to support their work. The brotherly fighting friendship forged with blood by the people of China and Korea through a long history has been increasingly consolidated in the struggle against our common enemy.

The editorial concluded: The American imperialists' barbaric war of aggression against our country is continuing fiercely. The people of China and Korea are inflicting heavy blows on the American imperialist aggressors on Korean territory. All the Korean people and the Korean People's Army must further develop patriotic enthusiasm and fight more heroically. We must pay warm tribute to the heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and further do a good job in supporting the front, to love and support them.

    在中华人民共和国宣布成立第二周年的时候，我们非常荣幸的向你们以及所有的中国工人表示法国工人最热烈最友爱的贺忱。
    法国工人希望中国的弟兄们在经济发展上获得最伟大的成功。他们为这些成功而赞赏，因为这对他们每天和阶级敌人所进行的斗争说来，是一种鼓励。
    这些成功，加上苏联以及其他人民共和国工人的成功，又再加上为保护他们经济社会利益与和平而斗争的帝国主义国家工人们的成功，对于加强民主和平阵营的力量，是一种强有力的贡献。
    法国工人非常钦佩人民中国面对着帝国主义者加倍挑衅时的沉着、冷静和坚决。他们也每天都在加强着争取人类和平、自由与独立的斗争。
    我们代表法国工人向英勇的中国人民和他们英明的领袖毛泽东同志致敬，向人民中国勇敢的战士致敬。他们与他们朝鲜的弟兄们在一起，拿着武器，为反对帝国主义侵略者而斗争；他们一定能够得到胜利。我们代表法国工人，向在争取和平自由斗争中牺牲的英雄致敬。
    亲爱的同志们！我们向你们保证：我们的友谊是永不可灭的。最后，我们向你们致以友爱的敬礼！法国总工会总书记法拉商勒里普（签字）

    社论写道：中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员以高度的爱国主义和国际主义思想武装起来，一贯地表现了钢铁般的自觉的纪律和崇高的道德素质。因此，朝鲜人民从迎接中国人民志愿军的头一天起，就以无上的感激和尊敬，一致奋起进行了支援他们的工作。朝中两国人民通过长期的历史，以鲜血结成的兄弟般的战斗友谊，在反对我们的共同敌人的斗争中已日益巩固。
    社论最后说：美帝国主义者对我国的野蛮的侵略战争，正在继续激烈地进行着。朝中两国人民正在朝鲜领土上予美帝国主义侵略者以沉重的打击。全朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军要更高度地发挥爱国热忱，更英勇地战斗。我们要向英雄的中国人民志愿军指战员致以热烈的敬意，要进一步做好支援前线的工作，来爱护和支援他们。
