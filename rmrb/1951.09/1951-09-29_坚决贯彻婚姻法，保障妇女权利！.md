    Since the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, remarkable achievements have been made. The broad masses of young men and women, especially women, have raised their consciousness and waged a fierce struggle against the feudal marriage system. Unreasonable marriage problems in society have been partially resolved; free marriage and democratic and harmonious new families have gradually emerged, thereby further enhancing the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of men and women. However, on a national scale, the degree of implementation of the Marriage Law is still very uneven; in some areas, the degree of implementation is not enough, and in some areas, it has not been implemented at all. Therefore, phenomena such as arranged and mercenary marriages, abuse or beating of women, and interference with men and women's freedom of marriage still exist universally. The phenomenon of women being abused and murdered or forced to commit suicide due to marriage and family problems is very serious. From the facts reported from various places, it can be seen that the number of women abused and committing suicide in various places is alarming, and the oppression suffered by women is cruel. This not only violates women's human rights and freedom, but also directly affects the unity of the people and affects the country's production and construction and social order. We must not tolerate the continued existence of this unreasonable phenomenon.

    In the new China where the revolution has been won and the people have been liberated, women's rights have been protected by government laws. Why do serious phenomena of harming women continue to occur? This is mainly due to the evils left over from the feudal social system, but at the same time, it is also because the cadres of party organizations, government agencies, and people's organizations in many areas lack a correct understanding and frequent publicity of the spirit of the Marriage Law. It must be pointed out that although China's thousands of years of feudal social system has been overthrown, the remnants of feudal ideas on marriage issues and women's issues still exist universally. The broad masses still retain the feudal idea of "men are superior to women" and the bad habits of "feudal patriarchs" and "husband power." Therefore, they strictly restrict women's participation in social and political activities, especially when women demand freedom of marriage, they regard it as "outrageous" and carry out all kinds of cruel persecution. This precisely demonstrates the fierce resistance of the remaining feudalism to the new-democratic marriage system. And many of our cadres, especially grassroots cadres, because they themselves are also influenced by the remnants of feudal ideas, and at the same time have not seriously studied the Marriage Law, lack sufficient understanding of the important political significance of the Marriage Law. Therefore, they often accommodate the backward ideas of the masses or fall behind the level of consciousness of the masses. For example, some cadres dare not publicize the Marriage Law, fearing that it will "cause divorce and chaos in the world"; some distort the Marriage Law on marriage issues involving themselves or related to themselves in order to achieve personal goals; some illegally deprive women of their freedom of divorce under the cover and disguise of "poor and hired peasant viewpoints"; some adopt an indifferent attitude towards the implementation of the Marriage Law; turn a blind eye to illegal acts of interfering with men and women's freedom of marriage and abusing and murdering women, and fail to investigate and deal with incidents of abusing and murdering women in a timely manner; and a few cadres even personally interfere with the masses' freedom of marriage, illegally forcing men and women who demand freedom of marriage to parade through the streets; and even privately establish courts and use torture to beat women.

    All these facts show that some cadres, no matter how heroic and resolute they are in other revolutionary struggles, as long as they are invaded by reactionary feudal ideas, they will still leave the people's position and objectively become defenders of the feudal system, thus directly and indirectly fueling the reactionary arrogance of discrimination and oppression against women, and even being utilized by counter-revolutionary class elements. These cadres must understand that any behavior that discriminates against and oppresses women is a reactionary idea. This idea directly harms the interests of women, seriously weakens the strength of the laboring people's unity against the enemy. People with this kind of thinking will not understand the great role of the broad masses of women in the revolutionary struggle and national construction, and they will not understand that women should and must have equal economic and political status as men, and that women are fully capable of having the same work efficiency as men to participate in various social activities and production activities.

    Now, in order to eliminate the phenomenon of abuse, murder, and persecution of women and implement the Marriage Law, we must launch a resolute and thorough struggle against all feudal ideas that discriminate against and oppress women. First of all, we must launch a struggle against the remnants of feudal ideas among cadres and vigorously raise the political awareness of men and women. Facts have proved that as long as the leading cadres of party organizations, government agencies, and people's organizations pay attention to and strengthen political and ideological education, they can correctly implement the marriage policy and correctly publicize it to the people, and the implementation of the Marriage Law will achieve remarkable results. Conversely, if this is not the case, then cadres are prone to various deviations in the implementation of the Marriage Law, and women's struggle for freedom of marriage will not receive due support and guarantee.

    The instructions issued by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, as well as the joint notice issued by five people's organizations to further assist the government in implementing the Marriage Law, are very important and practical needs. People's governments at all levels and people's organizations should conscientiously study and implement them. Party organizations at all levels should be responsible for supervising and inspecting the implementation; leading organs of judicial, civil affairs departments, and people's organizations such as workers, peasants, women, and youth at all levels should lead their subordinate cadres to systematically arrange the study of the Marriage Law, correctly grasp the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, launch a movement to inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law throughout the country, punish criminals who abuse and murder women, inspect the work style of cadres, and eliminate the remnants of feudal ideas of cadres themselves. Cadres who violate the law should be punished according to law; bureaucratic work styles that disregard the interests of the people and suppress the reasonable demands of the masses should be strictly criticized and publicly reviewed. People's organizations at all levels have the responsibility to mobilize the masses to report incidents of abuse and murder of women.

    To thoroughly eliminate all remnants of feudal ideas, we must also launch universal and in-depth publicity and education to the broad masses of men and women. In addition to regularly educating the masses in conjunction with trial, registration, and mediation work, judicial, civil affairs departments, and people's organizations in various places should contact and cooperate with the propaganda and education departments, and plan to mobilize and organize forces to use various propaganda tools and adopt various propaganda methods to vigorously expose the crimes of the feudal marriage system and publicize the benefits of the new-democratic marriage system; oppose abuse and beating of women, promote equality between men and women and freedom of marriage, and vigorously support the masses' struggle for freedom of marriage. Local newspapers, periodicals, news agencies, and radio stations should closely combine with the actual situation of the implementation of the Marriage Law and conduct publicity through specific events; local literary and art workers should use various literary and artistic forms to carry out literary and artistic activities and popularly publicize the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, especially being good at educating the masses through typical examples so that the masses can establish new families of democracy and harmony and unity and production. We must make efforts in all aspects to improve the political awareness of cadres and the people and strive to implement the Marriage Law!

### 坚决贯彻婚姻法，保障妇女权利！

    坚决贯彻婚姻法，保障妇女权利！
    中华人民共和国婚姻法公布实施以来，获得了显著的成绩。广大的青年男女特别是妇女群众提高了觉悟，向封建婚姻制度进行了激烈的斗争。社会上不合理的婚姻问题部分地得到了解决；自由婚姻与民主和睦的新家庭逐渐出现，从而更提高了男女人民的政治积极性及生产积极性。但是，就全国范围来说，婚姻法贯彻执行的程度还是很不平衡的；有的地区贯彻执行的程度很不够，有的地区根本没有贯彻执行下去。因此，包办和买卖的婚姻，对妇女的虐待或打骂，对男女婚姻自由的干涉等不合理现象，仍然普遍地存在着。妇女群众因为婚姻和家庭问题而被虐杀及被迫自杀的现象是十分严重的。从各地报道的事实中，可以看到各地妇女被虐杀及自杀的数目是惊人的，妇女所遭受的压迫是残酷的。这不仅侵犯了妇女的人权自由，而且直接影响了人民内部的团结，影响了国家的生产建设和社会秩序。我们决不能容忍这种不合理的现象继续存在。
    在革命已经获得胜利、人民已经翻身了的新中国，妇女的权利得到了政府法律的保护，为什么还会继续发生残害妇女的严重现象呢？这主要地固然是由于封建的社会制度遗留下来的恶果，但同时也是由于许多地区党的组织、政府机关和人民团体的干部对婚姻法的精神缺乏正确的认识与经常的宣传。必须指出：中国几千年的封建社会制度虽然已被推翻，但是在婚姻问题和妇女问题上的封建思想的残余仍然普遍地存在。广大的群众至今还保留着“男尊女卑”的封建思想，还保存着“封建家长”和“夫权”统治的恶习。因此他们对于妇女参加社会政治活动严加限制，尤其是对于妇女要求婚姻自由，更认为“大逆不道”，加以种种残酷的迫害。这正是表现了残余的封建主义思想对新民主主义婚姻制度的剧烈反抗。而我们的不少干部，特别是基层干部，因为本身也受了封建残余思想的影响，同时又没有认真学习婚姻法，对于婚姻法的重要政治意义认识不足，因而他们往往迁就了群众的落后思想，或落在群众觉悟程度的后面。如有的干部不敢宣传婚姻法，怕“引起离婚，天下大乱”；有的在牵涉到自己或与自己有关系的婚姻问题上，就曲解婚姻法，以求达到个人目的；有的在“贫雇观点”掩盖和伪装下，非法剥夺了妇女离婚的自由；有的对于婚姻法的执行采取漠不关心的态度；对于干涉男女婚姻自由、虐杀妇女的非法行为熟视无睹，对虐杀妇女的事件不及时追查与处理；还有少数干部竟亲身干涉群众婚姻自由，非法强迫要求婚姻自由的男女游街示众；甚至私立法庭，动刑拷打妇女。
    这一切事实都说明，有些干部不论在其他革命斗争中怎样英勇坚决，但只要被反动的封建思想所侵袭，就仍然会离开人民的立场，客观上成为封建制度的维护者，因而直接间接地助长了歧视和压迫妇女的反动气焰，甚至为反革命阶级的分子所利用。这些干部必须懂得任何歧视和压迫妇女的行为，都是一种反动的思想。这种思想直接危害妇女群众的利益，严重地削弱了劳动人民团结对敌的力量。有这种思想的人，就不会了解广大妇女群众在革命斗争和国家建设中的巨大作用，他们就不会了解妇女群众应该也必须和男子一样地获得平等的经济地位和政治地位，妇女完全能够平等地具有和男子同等的工作效能，来参加各种社会活动和生产活动。
    现在为了消灭虐杀和迫害妇女的现象，贯彻婚姻法，我们必须向一切歧视和压迫妇女的封建思想，展开坚决的彻底的斗争。首先要在干部中展开反对封建残余思想的斗争，用大力提高男女人民群众的政治觉悟。事实证明：只要党的组织、政府机关和人民团体的领导干部，注意和加强了政治思想教育，就能够正确地执行婚姻政策并正确地向人民进行宣传，婚姻法的执行就会有显著的成绩。反过来，如果不是这样，那末，干部在执行婚姻法中就容易发生各种各样的偏差，妇女争取婚姻自由的斗争就得不到应有的支持与保障。
    中央人民政府政务院所发布的关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示，以及五个人民团体为进一步协助政府贯彻执行婚姻法的联合通知，是非常重要和切合实际需要的。各级人民政府，人民团体，应切实研究执行。各级党的组织，应负责督促检查执行的情况；各级司法、民政机关和工人、农民、妇女、青年等人民团体的领导机关，应领导所属干部有系统地布置学习婚姻法，正确掌握婚姻法的基本精神，在全国范围内展开一个检查婚姻法执行情况的运动，并惩办虐杀妇女的罪犯，检查干部的工作作风，肃清干部本身的封建残余思想。对于违法的干部，应依法惩处；对于漠视人民利益、压制群众合理要求的官僚主义作风，应进行严格的批评，并公开进行检讨。各级人民团体有责任发动群众，对于虐杀妇女的事件进行检举。
    要彻底肃清一切封建残余思想，还必须向广大的男女群众展开普遍和深入的宣传教育。各地的司法、民政机关、人民团体除了结合审判、登记和调解工作，经常向群众进行教育以外，应与宣传教育部门联系和配合，有计划地动员和组织力量，运用各种宣传工具，采取各种宣传方式，大张旗鼓地揭露封建婚姻制度的罪恶，宣传新民主主义婚姻制度的好处；反对虐待和打骂妇女，提倡男女平等、婚姻自由，大力支持群众争取婚姻自由的斗争。各地报纸、刊物、通讯社、广播电台，都应该密切结合婚姻法执行的实际情况，通过具体事件，进行宣传；各地文学艺术工作者，应该运用各种文艺形式，展开文艺活动，通俗地宣传婚姻法的基本精神，特别要善于通过典型事例来教育群众，使群众都能建立民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭。我们必须从各方面努力，提高干部和人民群众的政治觉悟，为贯彻执行婚姻法而努力奋斗！
