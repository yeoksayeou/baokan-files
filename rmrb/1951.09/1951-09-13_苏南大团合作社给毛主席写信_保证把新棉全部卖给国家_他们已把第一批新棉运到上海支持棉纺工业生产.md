Su Nan Datuan Cooperative Writes Letter to Chairman Mao
Guaranteeing to Sell All New Cotton to the State
They Have Already Transported the First Batch of New Cotton to Shanghai to Support Cotton Textile Industrial Production

The Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Nanhui County, Su Nan District, which transported the first batch of new cotton to Shanghai on September 3rd, held its fourth members' representative meeting on September 5th. At this meeting, all the representatives wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, resolutely guaranteeing to sell all new cotton to the state. The full text of the original letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

On June 8th, we wrote to you, guaranteeing to sell all our stored cotton to the state. Now we are reporting to you that we have not only achieved this goal, but have also begun to sell new cotton. In the three months of June, July, and August, Datuan District sold a total of more than 5,750 dan of stored cotton, exceeding the original plan by 185 percent. Everyone also signed pre-sale cotton contracts with the cooperative, with the contracted cotton accounting for 97.6 percent of the planned output. At the end of August, new cotton began to enter the market, and the cooperative took in more than 300 dan of new cotton within a week. On September 3rd, our first batch of new cotton was transported to Shanghai by the cooperative.

Chairman Mao: Our actions are completely conscious and voluntary. Because we know that we are not selling cotton to others, but to the state. With a large amount of cotton, the state can enable factories to produce more cloth to meet the needs of our farmers and the people of the whole country, and at the same time stabilize prices. We also know that only by providing the state with sufficient industrial raw materials and building a strong industry can the production of farmers be truly developed. For more than two years since liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government have led us to distribute land, defeat feudal forces, help us organize our own cooperatives, stipulate reasonable cotton-grain price ratios, and call on us to "become rich by loving the country and planting more cotton." The cooperative has also helped us fertilize, remove insects, drain water, and fight drought. Therefore, although our cotton has recently suffered from a typhoon, the quality is still better than in previous years, and the output has exceeded last year. Now our bumper harvest is guaranteed, and we are living better than before.

Chairman Mao: We will never forget your kindness for generations to come! We resolutely guarantee to you:

1. As soon as the new cotton is picked, it will be dried, cleaned, and sold to the state.
2. Sell cotton collectively by village and batch, and encourage storing cotton in the cooperative.
3. Next year, we will produce more cotton to support the industrial construction of our great motherland and consolidate the national defense of our great motherland.

We wish you good health!

The Fourth Members' Representative Meeting of the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Nanhui County, Su Nan District, respectfully submitted by 298 representatives.

September 5th

Xinhua News Agency

The Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Su Nan District has transported the first batch of newly purchased cotton to Shanghai to support cotton textile industrial production. After overfulfilling the task of purchasing and storing cotton in June, the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Nanhui County then signed 478 new cotton sales contracts with all cotton farmers (including members and non-members), totaling more than 4.78 million jin of pre-purchased seed cotton, accounting for 97.6 percent of this year's planned cotton output in Datuan District. In addition, the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative also accepted order forms from 7,879 cotton farmers (there are a total of 8,318 cotton farmers in the district), guaranteeing to provide them with production materials and daily necessities such as grain, salt, fertilizer, and agricultural tools in a timely manner. When signing sales contracts and order forms with cotton farmers, the cooperative also emphasized the great significance of "quick harvesting, quick picking, quick ginning, and quick selling" for supporting national industrial production. Therefore, recently after the new cotton came on the market, cotton farmers have automatically organized themselves to pick cotton collectively, picking one boll at a time, and quickly sending it to the cooperative. From August 26th to September 3rd, the cooperative purchased a total of 36,307 jin of medium-grade seed cotton (including 58 jin of medium-grade lint). After rapidly processing the purchased new cotton in cooperation with the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company, the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative transported the first batch of new cotton to Shanghai on September 3rd, the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

When the first batch of new cotton was shipped, more than 200 representatives of all members gathered at the wharf to send it off. People from all walks of life in Datuan Town and workers from the Maoxin Yarn Factory also sent representatives and cultural troupes to the wharf to send it off. The Secretary of the Datuan District Committee of the Communist Party of China spoke to everyone at the wharf, calling on the member representatives to go back and mobilize cotton farmers to continue to quickly pick and sell cotton to ensure that the country's cotton textile factories can produce quickly to meet the needs of national defense and the needs of the people. After the new cotton was shipped, the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a cooperative members' representative meeting in the People's Auditorium. At the meeting, cotton farmer representatives unanimously expressed their guarantee to mobilize all cotton farmers in the district to quickly sell and store all new cotton.

    苏南大团合作社给毛主席写信
    保证把新棉全部卖给国家
    他们已把第一批新棉运到上海支持棉纺工业生产
    九月三日把第一批新棉运到上海的苏南区南汇县大团供销合作社，九月五日举行了第四届社员代表会议。在这次会议上，全体代表写了一封信给毛主席，坚决保证将新棉全部卖给国家。原信全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    六月八日我们曾写信给您，保证把全部存棉卖给国家。现在我们向您报告：我们不但达到了这个目标，并且已经开始卖出新棉。在六、七、八三个月中，大团区一共卖出存棉五千七百五十多担，超过原定计划百分之一百八十五。大家还和合作社订了预售棉花的合同，订合同的棉花占计划产量的百分之九十七点六。八月底新棉开始上市，合作社在一个星期内就收进新棉三百多担。九月三日，我们的第一批新棉已经由合作社运到上海去了。
    毛主席：我们的行动，完全是自觉自愿的。因为我们知道：我们不是把棉花卖给别人，而是卖给国家。国家有了大量棉花，可以使工厂多生产布匹，供应我们农民和全国人民的需要，同时也可因此稳定物价。我们也知道：只有供给国家充分的工业原料，建设起强大的工业，农民的生产才能真正的得到发展。解放两年多来，共产党和人民政府领导我们分得了土地，打垮了封建势力，帮助我们组织了自己的合作社，规定了合理的棉粮比价，号召我们“爱国发家，多种棉花”，合作社还帮助我们施肥、除虫、排水、抗旱，因此我们今年的棉花，虽然最近受到一次台风的灾害，但品质仍比往年好，产量也超过了去年。现在我们的丰收已有了保证，我们的日子已过得比从前更好了。
    毛主席：您这些恩情是我们子孙万代也忘不掉的啊！我们坚决向您保证：
    一、新棉一采下来，马上晒干、拣净，全部卖给国家。二、分村分批集体售棉，并鼓励把棉花存入合作社。三、明年还要生产更多的棉花，支援我们伟大祖国的工业建设，巩固我们伟大祖国的国防。祝您身体健康！
    苏南区南汇县大团供销合作社第四届社员代表会议二九八个代表敬上
    九月五日
    苏南区大团供销合作社已将第一批收购的新棉运到上海，支持棉纺工业生产。南汇县大团供销合作社在六月份超额完成了购、储存棉任务后，接着便与全体棉农（包括社员与非社员）签订了四百七十八件包销新棉合同，总计预购籽棉四百七十八万多斤，占今年大团区棉花计划产量的百分之九十七点六。此外，大团供销合作社又接受了七千八百七十九户棉农的订货单（全区共有八千三百一十八户棉农），保证及时供应他们粮食、盐、肥料、农具等生产资料和生活资料。在与棉农签订包销合同和订货单时，该社又着重宣传“快收、快摘、快轧、快售”对支持国家工业生产的重大意义，因此，最近新花登场后，棉农便都自动地组织起来，集体摘花，有一朵摘一朵，迅速地送到合作社里来。从八月二十六日开始到九月三日为止，合作社共收购了中级籽棉三万六千三百零七斤（包括中级皮棉五十八斤）。大团供销合作社协同国营花纱布公司迅速将收购的新棉进行加工后，便在九月三日抗日战争胜利六周年纪念日，向上海运出了第一批新棉。
    当第一批新棉起运时，全体社员代表二百多人齐集埠头欢送，大团镇各界人民和懋新纱厂的工人，也都派出代表和文工团，赶到埠头欢送。中共大团区区委书记在埠头上向大家讲话，号召社员代表回去动员棉农继续迅速摘花卖花，保证国家的棉纺工厂能够迅速生产，以应国防需要和人民的需要。新棉起运之后，大团供销合作社在人民会堂召开了合作社社员代表大会。会上棉农社员代表一致表示保证动员全区棉农迅速地售储全部新棉。
