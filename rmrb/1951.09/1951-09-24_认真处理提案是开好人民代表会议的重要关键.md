Seriously handling proposals and valuing the opinions and vital demands of the people are crucial keys to holding successful People's Representative Conferences. The People's Representative Conferences in Yuci and Yanggao counties provide beneficial examples.

From November of the year before last to June of this year, Yanggao County in Chahar Province held seven People's Representative Conferences. When the People's Representative Conference was first established in the county, it took the handling of people's proposals quite seriously, and as a result, the conferences were held relatively well. The first People's Representative Conference had more than 130 proposals, and the second conference had more than 60. Both conferences had a Proposal Review and Handling Committee, responsible for organizing and reviewing proposals brought by representatives, and handling them by category. Representatives and the people were very satisfied with this serious and responsible attitude of the working cadres. In particular, at the second conference, representatives criticized the second district chief of the county for illegal and derelict behavior in destroying forests and beating cadres. After investigation, the county People's Government confirmed the facts and dismissed the district chief. This greatly strengthened the representatives' sense of ownership and trust in the People's Representative Conference. Some representatives said: "This is truly the people being the masters!" However, the leading cadres of the county did not clearly recognize in their minds that handling proposals was one of the main contents of the People's Representative Conference, and also a crucial key to close the ties between the People's Government and the people. They only regarded the People's Representative Conference as a place for the government to deploy work. Therefore, since the third conference, they have only paid attention to how to implement and deploy tasks, and did not actively solicit proposals. The conference agenda was very tight, and the Proposal Review and Handling Committee was not established, effectively cancelling the "handling proposals" item. As a result, many representatives did not have the opportunity to raise the proposals they brought at the third and fourth conferences. Without the proposals being handled, the representatives lacked confidence in the People's Representative Conference. Some representatives said, "There is no way to explain to the masses when we go back," and some said, "It's useless to propose, I won't propose anymore." The enthusiasm of the representatives to attend the conferences was greatly affected, and in addition, the meeting notices were issued late, and appropriate solutions were not provided for the transportation of some elderly and female representatives living in rural areas, so many representatives were absent from each meeting.

The situation in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, was the opposite of that in Yanggao County. In the first few People's Representative Conferences held in the county, little consideration was given to the demands of the people, and even when considered, there was a lack of serious and responsible spirit. The conference only gave comprehensive and general answers to the proposals from the people, and focused on the propaganda and explanation of policies. The representatives felt that the proposals they raised were not specifically resolved, and they became indifferent to the conference, and the number of absentees gradually increased. For example, 62 representatives were absent from the fifth conference, accounting for more than one-third of the representatives who should have attended. After investigation and research, the leading cadres of the county discovered that one of the main reasons was the failure to specifically and promptly solve the urgent problems raised by the people. Therefore, the handling of proposals was improved at the sixth and seventh conferences. Proposals that needed to be specifically resolved were handled separately, in order of urgency and importance, after being explained at the meeting. All proposals from both conferences were compiled and printed into a booklet, with the names of the original proposal village and proposer noted at the end of each case, and distributed to each representative and village, so that representatives and the people could understand the handling of proposals. The results of the handling were reported at the next meeting. From then on, the representatives felt that meetings could solve problems, and the number of absentees gradually decreased. The representatives reflected: "We can explain it well when we go back," "Every word we say counts, we are truly the masters of our own affairs." When the people saw that the representative conferences could solve the major problems they raised in production and life, they became more supportive of the People's Representatives and the People's Government. For example, after the representatives raised the opinion that the waterwheels lent to the farmers of Mingqian Town in the county by the government last year were "not strong and not suitable," the county People's Government immediately notified the relevant departments to handle it. The local farmers said one after another: The representatives can really solve problems, this time the representatives have done a great thing for us.

### 认真处理提案是开好人民代表会议的重要关键

    认真处理提案是开好人民代表会议的重要关键
    认真处理提案，重视人民群众的意见和他们的切身要求，是开好人民代表会议的重要关键之一。榆次、阳高两县人民代表会议提供了有益的例证。
    察哈尔省阳高县从前年十一月到今年六月，先后开过七次人民代表会议。该县刚建立人民代表会议时，对处理人民提案比较认真，因此会议开得比较好。第一次人民代表会议有提案一百三十多件，第二次会议有提案六十多件。这两次会议都设有提案审查处理委员会，负责整理和审查代表带来的提案，并分门别类加以处理。代表和人民群众对于工作干部的这种认真负责态度感到十分满意。特别是在第二次会议上，代表们对于该县第二区区长破坏林木和打骂干部的违法失职行为提出批评，县人民政府调查属实后，即将该区区长撤职。这件事大大加强了代表的主人翁感觉和对人民代表会议的信任。有些代表说：这才是人民作主！但是该县领导干部没有在思想上明确认识到处理提案是人民代表会议的主要内容之一，也是密切人民政府与人民群众间联系的重要关键之一。他们只把人民代表会议当作政府布置工作的场所。因此自第三次会议以后，他们就仅仅注意如何贯彻布置任务，不主动地去征集提案。会议议程排得很紧，也不设立提案审查处理委员会，实际上取消了“处理提案”这一项内容，这样在第三、四次会议上很多代表就没有机会提出他们所带来的提案。提案没有处理，代表们对人民代表会议就缺乏信心。有的代表说“回去没办法向群众交代”，有的代表说“提了不顶事，再也不提了”。代表出席会议的积极性受到了很大影响，加以开会通知发得迟，对一些住在农村的年老和妇女代表来去的交通工具也未适当解决，因此每次会议都有不少代表缺席。
    山西省榆次县的情形正好与阳高县相反。该县最初几次召开人民代表会议时，很少考虑人民群众的要求，即便考虑，也缺乏认真负责的精神。会议对来自人民群众中的提案只作综合笼统地解答，而且偏重于政策方面的宣传解释。代表们感到所提提案得不到具体解决，对会议也就表示淡漠，缺席的逐次加多。如第五次会议缺席的代表达六十二人，占应出席代表的三分之一以上。该县领导干部经过调查研究后，发觉主要原因之一是没有具体、及时地解决人民群众提出来的迫切问题。因此，在第六、第七次会议上改进了提案的处理办法。须要具体解决的提案，除在会上说明外，会后即分别缓急轻重依次办理。这二次会议都把所有提案汇印成册，案尾都注明原提案村庄和提案人姓名，分发给每一代表和各村，以便代表和人民群众了解提案处理情形。下次举行会议时，又将处理结果提出报告。从此代表觉得开会能解决问题，缺席的逐渐减少。代表们反映：“咱们回去好交代”，“咱们说一句，顶一句，这真是当家作主人了。”人民群众看到代表会议能够解决他们提出的生产和生活上的重大问题，他们对于人民代表和人民政府也就更加拥护。如去年政府贷给该县鸣谦镇农民的几辆水车，代表提出“不坚固又不适用”的意见后，县人民政府即通知有关部门予以处理。当地农民群众纷纷说：代表真能解决问题，这次代表替咱们办了大事。
