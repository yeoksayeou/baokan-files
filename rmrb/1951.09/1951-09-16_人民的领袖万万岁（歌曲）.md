    Long Live the People's Leader
    Words by Guo Moruo
    Music by He Luting
  Note: This song is adapted from several folk songs of ethnic minorities. The whole song is divided into two sections: the first sixteen bars are the first section; the last nine bars are the second section. When singing, the emotion of the first section is intimate and respectful; the emotion of the second section is enthusiastic and joyful. Starting from the sentence "Long live, long live," the emotion should gradually strengthen and reach a climax. Pay attention to the transition of emotions between the front and the back, and do not be abrupt. The "?" on the last note is a sustain mark, and the last note can be appropriately prolonged according to the needs of the emotion. (Sun Shen)

    人民的领袖万万岁
    郭沫若  编词
    贺绿汀  作曲
  说明：这首歌词是根据少数民族的几首民歌改编的。全曲分两段：前十六小节是第一段；后九小节是第二段。唱时，第一段的感情是亲切的，崇敬的；第二段的感情则是热烈的和愉快的。从“万岁万岁”一句开始，情绪应当逐渐加强而达到高潮。前后转换感情的地方，须注意不要突然。最后一个音上的“?”是延长记号，唱时可依据情绪的需要，把最后一个音适当地延长。（孙慎）
