    Asian Students in the US Hold Symposium
    Opposing US-Imposed Treaty with Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, dated 19th] According to a Telepress dispatch from New York on the 17th, the University Intercollegiate Committee of the Asia Society sponsored a symposium on the Treaty with Japan. At the meeting, Asian students studying in the United States and Japanese-American students agreed with Asian opinions opposing the US-engineered Treaty with Japan. Burmese, Indian, and Japanese students currently studying in New York spoke at the symposium, reporting on the deep resentment their countries' people feel towards the US government's actions in forcing the treaty through. Indian student Bhattacharya criticized the narrow attitude taken by the US government in attempting to make all governments unquestionably submit to its position, describing the American attitude as "one of the worst factors in the international situation." Japanese-American Suzuki reported to the symposium that the Japanese people widely oppose the signing of this treaty. Suzuki said: "The Japanese people oppose this treaty most because they will suffer the most from it." He pointed out that the costs of Japan's re-militarization and the loss of trade with the Soviet Union and China will be two burdens forcibly imposed on the people by the treaty. Suzuki said that Japanese Buddhist and Christian groups also oppose this treaty.
    [Xinhua News Agency] Telepress, Melbourne, 17th: Cliff Evatt, Chief Secretary of the Government of New South Wales, Australia, recently said in a speech at a protest rally in Newcastle that the US Treaty with Japan is a "sinister and vicious treaty," "violating humanity, democracy, and natural justice."
