    The Democratic Reform Movement Deepens in Wuhan
    Facts Prove that Democratic Reform Does Not Hinder Production;
    Production Has Increased Significantly After Preliminary Reform.
    The democratic reform movement in Wuhan is gradually deepening and expanding. Forty-two larger state-owned and private factories and enterprises in the city have undergone or are undergoing democratic reform. Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill and Zhenhuan, Shenxin, Yuhua and other cotton mills have gone through the stage of democratic struggle against feudal remnants and the stage of democratic unity through internal criticism and self-criticism, and have entered the stage of democratic construction of consolidating organizations and establishing systems. Jianghan Shipbuilding Company and other units are also about to enter the stage of democratic unity. After the democratic struggle, most of these forty-two factories and enterprises carried out labor insurance card registration work, further raising the political consciousness of workers, exposing feudal remnants who had infiltrated the ranks of workers, and purifying the internal ranks. Since late July, the democratic reform movement has gradually expanded to medium and small factories, as well as the construction, lightering, and manure industries.

    Medium and small factories in Wuhan are scattered, with poor safety and hygiene, and strong feudal characteristics. Therefore, when carrying out the democratic reform movement, the general approach is to start by solving the specific problems that workers most urgently need to solve, then carry out the struggle to eliminate feudal remnants, and focus on reforming certain feudal systems. For example, the Sui Feng Packing Factory first solved the problems of "rent" and "rice subsidies" before launching the democratic reform movement.

    Struggle separately, handle separately.
    In the process of democratic struggle and democratic unity, most of the leading cadres of factories and enterprises in Wuhan are able to adopt a fighting method that adheres to principles while being flexible, based on the specific situation. Especially during the democratic struggle, under the unified and correct leadership of the Party, workers adopted the method of separate struggles and separate handling. The workers held accusation meetings to accuse the chief culprits of their crimes and demanded that they be handed over to the judicial organs for handling according to law. For general feudal remnants, workers held reasoning meetings to conduct reasoning struggles; and suggested that the factory administration or the capitalists demote, transfer, reduce wages, or place these people under the supervision of workers. For feudal pawns and lackeys who were of worker origin, the workers conducted criticism through criticism meetings and asked them to make self-criticisms; after these people admitted their mistakes, they were encouraged to produce well.

    The issues of handling feudal remnants and changing certain systems were resolved through the administrative side or the factory management committee in state-owned enterprises, and through labor-capital consultation in private enterprises. Factories and enterprises that have undergone preliminary democratic reform have mostly mobilized the workers, united the technicians and staff, strengthened the relationship between the leadership and the masses in state-owned factories and enterprises, and strived for the sympathy and support of the capitalists in private factories and enterprises.

            After overthrowing feudal remnants, workers
                actively care about production.
    When Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, Yuhua, Zhenhuan and other cotton mills carried out criticism and self-criticism during the democratic unity stage, most of the opinions raised by the workers were related to production. The opinions raised by the workers of No. 1 Cotton Mill mainly fell into three categories: the first category of opinions was about business management, accounting for the majority; the second category of opinions was about the work of the trade union and the style of leading cadres; the third category of opinions was about the phenomenon of technicians and staff being irresponsible for production and their undemocratic style. In the first category of opinions, the main issues were production plans, production responsibility system, shift handover system, the connection between upper and lower processes, inspection system, reward system, and raw material supply. Eighty percent of the opinions raised by the workers of the private Yuhua Cotton Mill were about production. This shows that after the working masses overthrew the feudal remnants, promoted the spirit of being masters of their own affairs, they actively cared about production and put forward reasonable suggestions.

    The production efficiency of factories and enterprises in Wuhan that have undergone preliminary democratic reform has gradually improved. The twenty-hour spindle yield of Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill has increased by about 1%, and the strand breakage in the roving room of the North Plant has decreased by 55%. The spindle yield of Yuhua Cotton Mill in June also increased by 0.3% compared with May. In the weaving room of Zhenhuan Cotton Mill, cadres and technical workers jointly studied and improved many tools, increasing the output and quality of cloth. The output per machine has now increased to about 50 yards. Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, private Yuhua Cotton Mill, etc., are now promoting the advanced operation method of Hao Jianxiu, a female cotton spinner from Qingdao, to reduce the rate of returned flowers. After struggling against feudal remnants, workers at Jiang'an Iron Factory studied technology, improved tools, and constantly created new records. Fan Zhongzhi, a technical worker at the mechanical workshop, invented a movable cutter, which eliminates the need to use a lathe for installing water pumps, and can be done manually, thus extending the life of the water pump and increasing work efficiency by 32 times. This reflects that after the preliminary change in production relations, the productive forces are developing smoothly.

        Consolidate achievements and continue to advance!
    At present, factories and enterprises that have entered the third stage of the democratic reform movement—the democratic construction stage—are improving the organization of trade unions and factory management committees, establishing a production responsibility system, signing contact contracts, establishing a democratic management system based on the production responsibility system, and preparing to clean up assets and verify funds; workers and staff of various factories and enterprises that have entered the second stage—the democratic unity stage—are conducting criticism and self-examination to further enhance the sense of being masters of their own affairs and brewing to reform certain old systems. The Enterprise Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also held a forum for enterprise cadres on August 17 to arrange the democratic unity work of various factories.

    武汉民主改革运动逐步深入
    事实证明民主改革不会妨碍生产，
    在初步改革后生产就已经显著提高。
    武汉市的民主改革运动，正在逐步深入和扩大。全市已经进行或正在进行民主改革的较大的国营私营工厂企业达四十二个单位。武汉第一纱厂和震寰、申新、裕华等纱厂，已经经过反对封建残余势力的民主斗争阶段和内部批评与自我批评的民主团结阶段，进入整顿组织、建立制度的民主建设阶段。江汉船舶公司等单位也将要进入民主团结阶段。这四十二个工厂企业大多数在民主斗争以后，进行了劳动保险卡片登记工作，进一步提高了工人的政治觉悟，检举了混入工人队伍里的封建残余分子，纯洁了内部。自七月下旬起，民主改革运动已逐步扩展到中、小工厂，以及建筑、驳划、粪便三个行业。
    武汉市中、小工厂地址很分散，安全卫生差，封建性大，所以在开展民主改革运动时，一般的是从解决工人最迫切需要解决的具体问题入手，然后贯彻肃清封建残余分子的斗争，并着重改革某些封建制度。如穗丰打包厂就是在开展民主改革运动以前，首先解决了“房租”和“米贴”的问题。
    分别斗争，分别处理。
    在民主斗争和民主团结的进程中，武汉市各工厂企业的领导干部，大多能根据具体的情况，采取坚持原则而又灵活运用的斗争方式。特别是在民主斗争时，工人们在党的统一的正确的领导下，采取分别斗争、分别处理的办法。工人们召开控诉大会，控诉首恶分子的罪恶，并要求把他们送交司法机关依法处理。工人们对一般的封建残余分子，则召开说理大会，进行说理斗争；并建议工厂行政方面或资方把这些人降职、调职、减少工薪，或由工人加以管制。对于工人出身的封建爪牙、狗腿子等，工人们就以批评会的方式，进行批评，并让他们作检讨；在这些人承认错误以后，鼓励他们好好生产。
    关于处理封建残余分子以及改变某些制度等问题，在国营企业是经过行政方面或工厂管理委员会来解决的，在私营企业是经过劳资协商来解决的。经过初步民主改革的工厂企业，大多发动了工人，团结了技师和职员，在国营工厂企业密切了领导方面和群众的关系，在私营工厂企业并争取了资方的同情和支持。
            斗倒封建残余以后，工人
                积极关心生产。
    武汉第一纱厂、裕华、震寰等纱厂，在民主团结阶段进行批评与自我批评时，工人们所提的意见，绝大部分是属于生产方面的。第一纱厂工人提出的意见中，主要有三类：第一类意见是关于经营管理的，占最多数；第二类意见是对工会工作和领导干部作风的意见；第三类意见是批评技师和职员对生产不负责任的现象和他们的不民主的作风。在第一类意见中，主要是关于生产计划、生产责任制、交接班制、上下工序的联系问题、检查制度、奖励制度，以及原材料供应问题等。私营裕华纱厂工人提出的意见中，百分之八十是关于生产的。由此可见，工人群众在斗倒了封建残余势力以后，发扬了主人翁的精神，便积极地关心生产，并提出了合理的意见。
    武汉市经过初步的民主改革的工厂企业，生产效率已经逐渐提高。武汉第一纱厂的二十小时锭扯已经提高了百分之一左右，北厂摇纱间的股线，减少百分之五十五。裕华纱厂的锭扯六月份也比五月份提高了百分之零点三。震寰纱厂的布机间，干部和技术工人共同研究，改进了许多工具，提高了布的产量和质量。每台车的产量，现已提高到五十码左右。武汉第一纱厂、私营裕华纱厂等，现正推行青岛纺纱女工郝建秀的先进操作方法，减少回花率。江岸铁工厂在斗争了封建残余势力以后，工人钻研技术，改进工具，不断创造了新纪录。机械场的技术工人范忠志发明了一个活动绞刀，使水泵上扣，不要上车床，用人力绞就行，因而能延长水泵的寿命，并提高了工作效率三十二倍。这反映了生产关系初步改变以后，生产力正在顺畅地发展。
        巩固成果，继续前进！
    目前已进入民主改革运动的第三阶段——民主建设阶段的工厂企业，正在健全工会和工厂管理委员会的组织，建立生产责任制，订立联系合同，确立在生产责任制基础上的民主管理制度，准备进行清理资产，核定资金；已进入第二阶段——民主团结阶段的各工厂企业的工人职员正在进行批评和检讨，进一步提高主人翁的感觉，酝酿改革某些旧的制度。中共武汉市委员会企业部并在八月十七日召开了企业干部座谈会，布置了各工厂的民主团结工作。（本报武汉记者站）开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处和耀华玻璃厂
