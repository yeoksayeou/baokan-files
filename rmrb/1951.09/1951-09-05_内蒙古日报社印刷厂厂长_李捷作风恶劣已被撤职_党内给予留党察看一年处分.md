Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

	Regarding Inner Mongolia Daily Printing Factory Director
	Li Jie Dismissed for Terrible Conduct; Given One-Year Probation Within the Party
Editor:
	The letter published in the People's Daily's Readers' Letters column on March 23rd, criticizing Director Li Jie of our printing factory, is fundamentally accurate in its factual assertions. We hereby respond with the following review and handling of the matter:

	Li Jie comes from a worker background, but his non-proletarian ideological consciousness is quite serious. He is dictatorial, implements a patriarchal leadership style, and exhibits vile conduct such as selfishness and retaliatory attacks.

	Li Jie has engaged in improper relationships with women several times in the past, creating a very bad influence among the workers. Instead of adopting a self-critical attitude towards these errors, Li Jie concealed them from the organization and covered up his mistakes. He often retaliated against those who reported and exposed his wrongdoings.

	Li Jie's selfish behavior is also severe, and he has undermined the system for his own benefit. He had himself, his wife, and his wife's classmates' photos developed in the phototypesetting section, wasting over 400,000 yuan of public property. Li Jie's wife did not abide by labor discipline, frequently arriving late and leaving early, and did not perform the menial tasks that apprentices should. When others reported this, Comrade Li Jie ignored it and tore up the report.

	During the Chahar Province Labor Model Conference this February, Li Jie arbitrarily fabricated model deeds in order to become a labor model, such as claiming that the use of hemp oil to replace ink oil, which had already been tested and applied by others, was his own "invention," and exaggerating production achievements.

	Comrade Li Jie's errors demonstrate that his non-proletarian ideological consciousness has developed to an extremely serious degree and has severely damaged the Party's prestige among the workers and revolutionary interests. In order to uphold Party discipline and give him an opportunity to correct his mistakes, the Party has decided to place him on probation within the Party for one year and administratively remove him from his position as Deputy Minister of the Management Department and Director of the Factory.

	The occurrence of Li Jie's mistakes also indicates that our newspaper has serious shortcomings in its leadership. First, our political principles are insufficient; we did not promptly launch ideological struggles, only seeing the positive aspects while not paying enough attention to shortcomings and errors, and our criticism was not strict enough. Second, our democratic style is inadequate; criticism and self-criticism have not been well developed, thereby undermining the enthusiasm of our comrades.

	The original letter of criticism contains the following inaccuracies. The letter stated: "Apprentice Lu Yusheng, unable to withstand the factory director's threats, bought 10,000 yuan worth of mercury to commit suicide by poisoning." Lu Yusheng was dissatisfied with his work (typecasting) and requested a job transfer several times. He was criticized for his inappropriate request and had considered such an act, but did not actually buy 10,000 yuan worth of mercury to prepare for suicide. In addition, the criticism letter's statements that typecasting section "Deputy Head Huang Chunxue attempted to hang himself," "Wang Shufang joined the Party simply because she introduced a spouse to Director Li Jie," and "Section Head Zhao Jingfang forced Zhang Haishan to work overtime, causing him to fall ill" are all somewhat exaggerated.

### 内蒙古日报社印刷厂厂长  李捷作风恶劣已被撤职  党内给予留党察看一年处分

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    内蒙古日报社印刷厂厂长
    李捷作风恶劣已被撤职
    党内给予留党察看一年处分编辑同志：
    三月二十三日人民日报读者来信栏刊载批评本社印刷厂李捷厂长的信，其中所指出的李捷同志的错误，基本事实都是对的，现将检查及处理结果答复如下：
    李捷是工人出身，但是非无产阶级思想意识相当严重：独断独行，实行家长式的领导，并有自私自利报复打击等恶劣作风。
    李捷过去曾经几次搞不正当的男女关系，在工人群众中造成很坏的影响。李捷对这些错误，不是采取自我批评的态度，而是隐瞒组织，掩盖自己的错误。对于反映与揭发他的错误行为的人，常常进行打击报复。
    李捷的自私自利行为也很严重，并为此而破坏制度。他曾在照像制版股洗自己和爱人以及他爱人同学的像片，耗费公家财产四十余万元。李捷的爱人不遵守劳动纪律，经常迟到早退，又不做学徒应做的零活。别人汇报后，李捷同志毫不在意并将汇报撕毁。
    今年二月察哈尔省召开劳动模范大会时，李捷为了当劳动模范竟任意捏造模范事迹，如早经别人试验应用的大麻子油代调墨油，李捷说是自己的“发明”，并夸大生产成绩。
    李捷同志的错误，说明他的非无产阶级思想意识已发展到极严重程度，并已严重地损害了党在工人群众中的威信和革命的利益。为了严肃党的纪律，并予以改正错误的机会，党内决定予以留党察看一年的处分，行政上撤消其经理部副部长及工厂厂长的职务。
    李捷错误的发生，也说明了我们报社领导上有严重的缺点。一是政治原则性不够，没有及时开展思想斗争，只看见成绩的一面，而对缺点和错误重视不够，批评也不够严格。二是民主作风不够，批评与自我批评未能很好地开展，因此也就损害了同志们的积极性。
    原批评信有以下几点是与事实有出入的。批评信中说：“学徒吕玉生因不堪厂长威胁，买了一万元的水银欲服毒自杀”。吕玉生因对自己工作（铸字）不满，几次要求调动工作，因他要求不当曾受到批评。被批评后曾经有过这种念头，实际并未买一万元水银准备自杀。此外，批评信中所说铸字股“副股长黄春学欲悬梁自缢”、“王淑芳就因为给李捷厂长介绍了爱人，所以入了党”，及“股长赵景芳强迫张海山加班因而病倒”的说法，都有些夸大。
