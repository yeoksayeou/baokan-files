    Resolutely Oppose Corporal Punishment of Students
    To the Editor:
    After reading "Corporal Punishment of Students Occurs Continuously in Various Parts of Chahar Province" in the "Cultural Life Trends" column on August 27th, I have some opinions:
    New Democratic education opposes imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Corporal punishment, a feudal method of managing students, must be strictly prohibited. However, in some areas of Chahar Province, corporal punishment of students has occurred continuously: some students were beaten until their noses were bruised and their faces were swollen; some were even tied up with ropes; some were made to sit in solitary confinement. This crude and barbaric method will destroy children's physical and mental health, and turn them into timid, cowardly, and blindly obedient people, causing immeasurable losses to the new society. This behavior is not only forbidden by the people's government's education policy but also cannot be tolerated by the new society's morality.
    Teachers should know that children are the treasures of the country. The concrete manifestation of teachers serving the people is to serve children wholeheartedly. Teachers should care about children's lives, correct their own behavior, and influence them with their actions; they should study children's psychology and persuade them with reason; so that children can be educated to become new people with strong character, brave, lively, loving the motherland, loving the people, and obeying the truth.
    I suggest that those teachers who have treated children with crude and barbaric behavior should conduct deep self-reflection, and should strengthen their study of relevant education policies and laws, study teaching methods, and improve their ideological and professional levels to improve their teaching work. At the same time, I hope that comrades in the education field and people from all walks of life can severely expose these criminal acts against children and wage a resolute struggle against feudal disciplinary methods, so as to completely abolish corporal punishment nationwide.

### 坚决反对体罚学生

    坚决反对体罚学生编辑同志：
    读了八月二十七日“文化生活动态”栏“察南各地连续发生体罚学生事件”后，我有一些意见：
    新民主主义教育是反对帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本主义的教育，对于封建的管理学生的方法——体罚，是要严格禁止的。而察南某些地区竟连续发生体罚学生事件：有的把学生打得鼻青脸肿；有的竟用绳索捆绑学生；有的让学生坐禁闭。这种粗暴的野蛮的方法，会摧残儿童的身心，把儿童教养成为胆小、懦怯、盲从的人，给新社会造成的损失是无穷的。这种行为不但为人民政府教育政策所不许，也为新社会道德所不能容忍。
    教师应该知道，儿童是国家的财宝。老师们为人民服务的具体表现，就是全心全意地为儿童服务。教师应该关心儿童的生活，端正自己的行为，用行动去影响他们；要研究儿童的心理，用道理去说服他们；以便将孩子们教养成为具有坚强性格，勇敢、活泼，热爱祖国，热爱人民，服从真理的新人。
    我建议：那些曾经用粗暴和野蛮的行为对待过儿童的教师，应该进行深刻的反省，并且要加强学习有关教育的政策和法令，学习教学方法，提高自己的思想水平和业务水平，来改进自己的教学工作。同时希望教育界同志们和社会人士，均能严厉揭发这些对待儿童的犯罪行为，向封建的管训方式做坚决斗争，以求在全国范围内，彻底废除体罚。
