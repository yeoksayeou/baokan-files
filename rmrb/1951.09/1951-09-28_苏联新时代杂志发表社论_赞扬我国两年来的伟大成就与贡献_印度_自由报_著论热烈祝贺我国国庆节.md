Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 27th. The New Times magazine, published on the 26th, featured a huge photo of Chairman Mao in celebration of our National Day and published an editorial entitled "The People's Republic of China in the Past Two Years." The editorial stated: "In the past two years, the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong, have fundamentally transformed the country's political and social systems. This semi-colonial country, which not long ago was wantonly ruled by foreign imperialism, has become a truly free and independent country. This country, which was divided for a long time by warlord civil wars, has become a unified country. Feudal oppression and reactionary systems have been replaced by people's power and a truly democratic system. Centuries of backwardness have given way to progress in the economic and cultural fields. Social conditions that trapped the people in eternal poverty have been replaced by a new social order that has opened the way for a rapid increase in the people's happiness." The editorial then listed the great achievements of New China in various fields and emphasized that: An awakened China has only begun to grow and is not yet an adult. However, even its initial steps are giant strides forward. From the first day of its birth, the People's Republic of China has had to wage a fierce struggle against US imperialism. US imperialism has attempted to isolate China diplomatically, blockade it economically, and finally turned to open aggression. It would be absurd and ridiculous if anyone seriously thought that they could ignore a country with a population almost twice that of the United States, Britain, and France combined. The editorial concluded by emphasizing the role of Sino-Soviet friendship, saying: "This great friendship is a bulwark of peace in the Far East and a guarantee of further success and prosperity for the People's Republic of China."
    This issue of New Times magazine also published an article entitled "Life in New China," introducing the achievements of New China in the past two years.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 27th. The Bengali daily "Freedom" in Calcutta, India, published an editorial on September 22nd, warmly congratulating our National Day. The editorial stated: "October 1st this year is the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. For the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, this day is a day of historical significance."
    The editorial described the victory of the Chinese people against imperialism, the achievements of land reform, and the enormous construction work carried out by New China. The editorial pointed out that the Chinese people are no longer plagued by hunger, cold, and especially unemployment, and that "everywhere is filled with joy."
    The editorial continued: "Today, on the land of China, human glory is boundless. There, the Asian people have stopped the various barbaric acts of the war mongers, thereby victoriously defending the ideal of Asian freedom. Thousands upon thousands of volunteers have set off from there to Korea, sharing weal and woe with the Korean people like brothers. Hundreds of thousands of tons of grain have been shipped from there to relieve famine-stricken India. This China is New China. This is the new country under the leadership of the Communist leader Mao Zedong. This is why October 1st is such an epoch-making day."
    The editorial concluded: China warmly welcomes Indian people to offer congratulations at the glorious celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Chinese people's organizations have directly sent invitations to famous leaders and individuals of various mass organizations in India. Some Indian representatives have already set off for Beijing. This day is also a day of joy for the Indian people. We hope that these Indian representatives can bring the sincere congratulations of the Indian people there. Let the people of these two great ancient Asian countries unite and smash all the conspiracies of the imperialist bandits on Asian land! Let the increasingly consolidated friendship between the people of these two countries make peace on the Asian continent unbreakable!

    苏联新时代杂志发表社论
    赞扬我国两年来的伟大成就与贡献
    印度“自由报”著论热烈祝贺我国国庆节
    【新华社莫斯科二十七日电】二十六日出版的新时代杂志为庆祝我国国庆，特刊登了毛主席的巨幅照像，并发表了题为“两年来的中华人民共和国”的社论。社论说：“两年来伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东为首的中国共产党的领导下，根本改造了国家的政治制度和社会制度。这个不久以前还被外国帝国主义放肆地统治的半殖民地国家，已经变成了真正自由和独立的国家。这个长期受军阀内战分裂的国家已成为统一的国家了。封建的压迫和反动的制度，已经为人民政权和真正民主制度所代替。千百年的落后已让位于经济和文化方面的进步。陷人民于永世贫穷的社会条件，已为新的社会秩序所代替了，这种新的社会秩序为迅速地增进人民的幸福开辟了道路。”社论接着历举了新中国在各方面的伟大成就，并强调说：觉醒了的中国只不过是开始成长，还没有成年。但是，即使它最初的步伐，也是大踏步前进的。中华人民共和国从诞生的第一天起，就得对美帝国主义进行激烈的斗争。美帝国主义曾企图在外交上孤立中国，在经济上封锁中国，最后并转而实行公开的侵略。假如有人当真以为，可以忽视这样一个人口比美、英、法三国加起来几乎还要多一倍的国家，那的确是荒谬可笑的。社论最后强调中苏友谊的作用说：“这个伟大的友谊是远东和平的堡垒，是中华人民共和国进一步成功和繁荣的保证。”
    本期新时代杂志并发表了题为“新中国的生活”的论文，介绍新中国两年来的成就。
    【新华社新德里二十七日电】印度加尔各答孟加拉文日报“自由报”于九月二十二日发表社论，热烈祝贺我国国庆节。社论说：“今年十月一日是中华人民共和国成立二周年纪念日。对全世界人民说来，特别是对亚洲人民说来，这一天是具有历史意义的一天。”
    社论叙述了中国人民反对帝国主义的胜利、土地改革的成就以及新中国所进行的巨大的建设工作。社论指出：中国人民已不受饥、寒、特别是失业的侵扰，“到处都是喜洋洋的”。
    社论接着说：“今天在中国的国土上，人的光荣是无限的。在那里，亚洲人民制止了战争贩子的种种横蛮无理的行为，从而胜利地保卫了亚洲自由的理想。成千成万的志愿军从那里开往朝鲜，和朝鲜人民像兄弟般地共患难。数以十万吨计的粮食从那里运出救济闹饥荒的印度。这个中国是新中国。这是共产党领袖毛泽东领导下的新国家。这就是十月一日之所以是划时代的一天的原因。”
    社论在结语中写道：中国热诚欢迎印度人士在中华人民共和国成立二周年的光荣的庆祝会上致祝词。中国的人民团体已直接给印度各群众团体的著名领袖和个人发了请帖。有些印度代表已启程前往北京。这一天也是印度人民欢欣鼓舞的一天。我们希望这些印度代表能够把印度人民的衷心的祝贺带到那里。让这两个伟大的亚洲古国的人民团结一致，粉碎帝国主义强盗在亚洲土地上的一切阴谋诡计吧！让这两个国家人民之间的日益巩固的友谊使亚洲大陆上的和平成为牢不可破的吧！
