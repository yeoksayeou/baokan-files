    The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain Calls on the British People to Be Vigilant Against the American Conspiracy to Expand the War of Aggression Against Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th] Reuter's London, 14th: The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement today calling on the British people to be vigilant against new American attempts to expand the Korean War. The statement said: "At the very beginning of the negotiations, the American generals put forward the demand to acquire North Korean territory north of the 38th parallel, attempting to undermine the negotiations by this method. From the beginning, these Americans have used the negotiation period to intensify the criminal bombing of peaceful Korean residents and prepare for new offensives. Even the location of the ceasefire negotiations was bombed by American planes, and their shameless attempts to deny this action finally had to be abandoned." The statement warned: "Now the clamor to launch a new aggressive offensive to conquer Korea has been raised again. The threat of expanding the war to China is increasing." The Executive Committee called for "a strong expression of public opinion again" to "stop actions that undermine the peace talks." The statement concluded by calling for an end to the Korean War, a ceasefire based on the 38th parallel, and the recall of all British troops in Korea.

    英共执行委员会号召英国人民
    警惕美国扩大侵朝战争的阴谋
    【新华社十五日讯】电通社伦敦十四日电：英国共产党执行委员会今天发表声明，号召英国人民警惕美国扩大朝鲜战争的新企图。声明说：“美国将军们在谈判一开头的时候，就提出取得三八线以北的北朝鲜领土的要求，企图用这种方法来破坏谈判。这些美国人自始就利用谈判期间来加紧对朝鲜和平居民进行罪恶的轰炸和准备新攻势。甚至停火谈判的地址也遭到美国飞机轰炸，而且他们抵赖这种行动的无耻企图也终于不得不放弃。”声明警告说：“现在发动新的侵略攻势来征服朝鲜的叫嚣又发出来了。把战争扩大到中国去的威胁已在增加着。”执行委员会号召“舆论再作出有力的表示”，以“制止破坏和谈的行动。”声明结语要求结束朝鲜战争，以三八线为基础实行停火并召回英国在朝鲜的全部部队。
