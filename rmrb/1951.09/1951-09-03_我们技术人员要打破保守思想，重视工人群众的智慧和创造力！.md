    We Technicians Must Break with Conservative Thinking and Value the Wisdom and Creativity of the Working Masses!
    Wang Erxiang, Acting Technician of Qingdao State-owned Sixth Cotton Mill

    I am honored to have participated in the summarization and promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. This work greatly inspired and educated me, corrected some incorrect understandings in my past thinking, and improved me politically, technically, and in management work. In this work, I have the following understandings and experiences:

    Hao Jianxiu's achievement of reducing roller-lapping waste was discovered as early as last year, but it did not attract my attention. It wasn't until the higher-ups discovered this achievement and asked me to summarize her work experience that I became anxious. I usually spend all day spinning around in the circle of routine affairs, rarely paying attention to work methods. During the summarization, I had two incorrect understandings in my thinking: (1) Aiming too high and shying away from practical work, thinking, what value could reducing a few ounces of waste have? Isn’t this making a mountain out of a molehill? (2) Subjectively believing that Hao Jianxiu could produce less roller-lapping waste than others simply because she had a good work attitude, was responsible, and did a good job of cleaning – simply "diligent." Under the control of such thinking, I naturally would not delve into the problem deeply. Therefore, I only talked to a few people to understand the situation and then sat in the office to write the summary. How could such a rough and irresponsible work attitude produce a correct summary? Therefore, I listed the previously reported "Three Diligences and Three Quicknesses" as the first point in the summary. The four words "Three Diligences and Three Quicknesses" vulgarized Hao Jianxiu's work method, causing everyone to misunderstand it, which caused great obstacles in promoting the work, resulting in irreparable losses. Thinking back, it is truly painful! Why did this happen? Today, to rigorously criticize it, it is primarily due to the lack of a mass perspective and the failure to establish the idea of relying on the working masses to do a good job in production. If we could value the creativity of the workers, then Hao Jianxiu's record of reducing roller-lapping waste should have attracted our attention long ago, and we should have conducted good research and summarization. We would never have dragged it out for several months, nor would we have summarized the "Three Diligences and Three Quicknesses"!

    Secondly, I also had the thought of not trusting the working masses. After Hao Jianxiu's work method was scientifically analyzed and summarized, I had some preliminary understanding of it. For example, the past system of timed cleaning and timed inspection of cleaning had a certain effect in the past. However, with the improvement of workers' awareness, in today's production, it not only loses its effect but also hinders the development of production. Regarding this matter, I had concerns, thinking that if Hao Jianxiu's work method were implemented and timed cleaning and inspection were abolished, would anyone not even do the cleaning work? What would happen if this were the case? The facts have told me that through this promotion work, the workers all excitedly said: "In the past, we were required to do certain work at certain times, and we had to finish it no matter whether we had time or not, which made us sweaty and exhausted and delayed production. This time, we have truly become the masters of the machines!" As a result, work enthusiasm was improved, and the machines were often kept clean. These facts have educated me that if we still have conservative ideas and do not unite the masses and rely on the workers, it is impossible to do a good job in production. At the same time, it also makes me deeply realize that Hao Jianxiu's work method is scientific and meets the requirements of production development.

    In the past, I also had a wrong understanding, that when I encountered difficulties in promotion work, I would sometimes feel frustrated, thinking that it was difficult to lead and manage. Through this promotion work, I studied technical and production problems with the workers every day, which made me deeply realize that today's leadership style should be to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses to study every problem. We should be good at gathering the experience of the masses, analyzing it, raising it to the level of theory, and then guiding practice; we cannot use purely technical viewpoints to rigidly transplant things from books to work. In promoting the work, we must also repeatedly explain to the masses why we do this and what the benefits are, so that everyone has a clear understanding in their thinking, so that the work can be smoothly promoted. We must also deeply understand what difficulties there are in promoting the work, and when we encounter difficulties, we must study and overcome them in a timely manner. This will not only be supported by the masses, but more importantly, it can give full play to the production enthusiasm of the masses.

    In this work, I not only clearly recognized the above problems, but also deeply realized that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method promotion movement not only has significant value in reducing roller-lapping waste, increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs, but also helps us learn how to concentrate advantages, eliminate disadvantages, and create a set of scientific operating methods, making the work regular and giving us a clear understanding and clear goals to strive for; and more importantly, it has raised the level of thinking in the process of ideological struggle. Especially for us technicians, it has a great educational significance. It makes us abandon conservative ideas, change the past idea of underestimating labor, and recognize the infinite wisdom of the working masses, thus making us clearly recognize that only by closely relying on the working masses can we do a good job in production. In the future, I must study the Hao Jianxiu Work Method well, break away from the circle of bureaucracy, and step up the study of politics and technology to build our great motherland.

### 我们技术人员要打破保守思想，重视工人群众的智慧和创造力！

    我们技术人员要打破保守思想，重视工人群众的智慧和创造力！
    青岛国营第六棉纺厂代理技师  王尔骧
    我很荣幸地参加了郝建秀工作法的总结和推广工作。这次工作大大地启发与教育了我，并纠正了我过去思想上一些不正确的认识，使我在政治上、技术上及管理工作上，都提高了一步。在工作中我有以下几点认识和体会：
    郝建秀同志少出皮辊花的成绩，早在去年就发现了，但一直没有引起我的重视。直到上级发现了这个成绩，要我总结她的工作经验时，我才着了急。我平时一天到晚在事务圈子里打转转，很少注意工作法。在总结的时候，思想上有这样两种不正确的认识：（一）好高鹜远，没有脚踏实地的来进行工作，认为少出几两花能有多大价值？未免是小题大做。（二）主观地认为郝建秀能比旁人出皮辊花少，无非是劳动态度好，工作负责，清洁工作干得好，“勤快”而已。在这样的思想支配下，当然就不会去深入钻研问题，因此仅仅找了几个人谈谈，了解一下情况，就坐在办公室写起总结来了。这种粗枝大叶不负责任的工作态度，那能写出什么正确的总结来呢？因之又把以前报上登载过的“三勤三快”列在总结中的第一条。“三勤三快”这四个字庸俗化了郝建秀的工作法，使大家错误地认识了郝建秀工作法，因此在推进工作当中起了极大的阻碍作用，使工作遭受了不可弥补的损失。回想起来真是痛心得很！为什么会这样呢？今天严格地来批判一下，这首先是由于没有群众观点，没有树立起依靠工人群众搞好生产的思想。要是能够重视工人的创造性，那末郝建秀少出皮辊花的纪录，早就该引起我们重视，而去很好地进行研究与总结，绝不会拖拉了好几个月，也不会再总结出个“三勤三快”了！
    其次，我还有不相信工人群众的思想。郝建秀工作法经过科学分析总结出来之后，我对郝建秀的工作法有了些初步的认识。例如过去的定时清洁和定时检查清洁的制度，在过去是有它一定作用的。可是，随着工人觉悟程度的提高，在今天的生产中，它不但失去了作用，而且还会阻碍生产的发展。对于这件事我却存在着顾虑，认为实行了郝建秀工作法，取消了定时清洁和检查，这样一来，会不会有人连清洁工作都不干了？要是有这样情形，那可怎么样办？事实告诉了我，通过这次推广工作，工人们都兴奋地说：“过去规定什么时候干什么活，不管你有没有时间也得把它干完，累得满身大汗，还耽误了生产，这回我们可真正当了机器的主人了！”因之提高了工作热情，机器还经常保持着清洁。这些事实教育了我，要是还存在着保守思想，不去团结群众依靠工人，要想来搞好生产，那是不可能的。同时也使我深深地体会到郝建秀工作法是科学的，是合乎生产发展的要求的。
    我在过去还有一个错误的认识，就是在推广工作中碰到了困难，有时就想不开，认为难于领导，不好管理。通过了这次的推广工作，每天都和工人们在一起研究技术和生产上的问题，使我深深地体会到：今天的领导方式，应当是虚心地倾听群众的意见，来研究每一个问题。应当善于把群众的经验集中起来，加以分析，提高到理论上，再去指导实践；而不能用单纯技术观点，把书本上的东西硬生生地搬到工作中去。在推进工作中还必须向群众反复地说明为什么要这样做，这样做有什么好处，使每个人在思想上有了明确的认识，这样才能使工作顺利地推进。在工作推进中有那些困难也要深入地了解，遇到困难要及时地加以研究克服。这样不但会受到群众的拥护，更重要的是更能发挥群众的生产积极性。
    在这一次工作中，我不仅明确地认识了以上的几个问题，同时也深深地体会到：郝建秀工作法的推广运动，不仅是在减少皮辊花、增加产量、提高品质、减低成本上有重大的价值，而且还帮助我们学习如何集中优点，去掉缺点，搞出一套科学的操作方法，使工作规律化，使我们心中有数，有了明确的奋斗目标；同时更重要的是在思想斗争过程中提高了思想水平。尤其是对我们技术人员，有着极大的教育意义，它使我们丢开了保守思想，改变了过去轻视劳动的想法，认识了工人群众的无穷智慧，因而使我们明确地认识了：惟有紧紧地依靠工人群众才能搞好生产。今后我一定要好好地学习郝建秀工作法，摆脱事务主义的圈子，加紧学习政治和技术，来建设我们伟大的祖国。
