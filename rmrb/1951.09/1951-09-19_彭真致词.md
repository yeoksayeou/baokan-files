Peng Zhen's Speech

Gentlemen, Comrades, Guests:

    We warmly congratulate Mr. Soong Ching Ling on gloriously winning the Stalin Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples"! We sincerely thank the Soviet Committee for Stalin Prizes "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples," named after the great Stalin, for the encouragement given to the Chinese people!

    Mr. Soong Ching Ling is an outstanding representative of the peace-loving and democratic Chinese people. She has waged a long-term and resolute struggle for the cause of peace and democracy, and together with the people of the whole country led by the great Chairman Mao Zedong, has waged an arduous and outstanding struggle. This struggle was carried out under the banner of the great Stalin and is part of the struggle of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union to defend peace. Mr. Soong Ching Ling's receipt of the Stalin International Prize is her personal glory and the glory of the Chinese people.

    At present, the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace is at a crucial period. On the one hand, the camp of peaceful countries has grown unprecedentedly, and the movement of the people in capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries to defend peace is rising; on the other hand, the enemies of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism and its lackeys—in order to step up open preparations for a new world war, have begun to restore Japanese militarism, have begun to rearm West Germany, and have violated international agreements and human justice, hastily and unreasonably signed the U.S.-made Japanese peace treaty, shamelessly and openly destroying the Korean armistice negotiations, and persisting in its aggression against Korea and our country. However, this death throes of the imperialists will never be able to save them from defeat. On the contrary, the internal contradictions of the imperialist countries are becoming increasingly acute, and the division and mutual struggle between the ruling groups of the imperialist countries are also becoming increasingly fierce. At the same time, their crimes of provoking world war, undermining world peace, and expanding aggression have aroused the growing dissatisfaction of the people of these imperialist countries and the people of the invaded countries, thus making the warmongers increasingly isolated. Therefore, we can assert that they will inevitably encounter more and more serious difficulties; they will inevitably encounter more and more heavy blows from the people who defend peace.

    Our people love peace. For the cause of peace and democracy in our motherland, for the cause of peace and democracy in defending the Far East and the world, we have already made great contributions in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we suffered huge losses that are difficult to calculate with numbers and difficult to describe with words. Therefore, we have the undeniable right to participate in the preparation and decision-making of all issues related to peace in the Far East and the world, especially the issue of formulating a peace treaty with Japan. All illegal acts and attempts that ignore this right of our country are unanimously opposed by the people of the whole country and will inevitably suffer the blows they deserve.

    In order to defend world peace and the security of our motherland, we are wholeheartedly carrying out the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Since the Chinese People's Volunteers participated in the war on the Korean front, they have cooperated with the Korean People's Army to annihilate more than 300,000 U.S. and Rhee's invading troops, including 140,000 U.S. troops. The people of the whole country have enthusiastically donated thousands of aircraft for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. At present, the nationwide movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is continuing to deepen and develop. We firmly believe that we will be able to bring the Korean War to a victorious end.

    Now, the strength of our people in defending peace is rapidly continuing to grow, and the strength of the whole world in defending peace is also rapidly continuing to grow. We can assert that the history of the world must advance according to the will of the peace-loving people, not according to the delusions of the warmongers, and the final victory must belong to the world's people who defend peace. Peace will surely triumph over war.

    Long live the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Long live Marshal Stalin!

    彭真致词各位先生，各位同志，各位来宾：
    我们热烈地祝贺宋庆龄先生光荣地获得了“加强国际和平”斯大林奖金！我们衷心感谢以伟大的斯大林的名字来命名的苏联“加强国际和平”奖金委员会所给予中国人民的鼓舞！
    宋庆龄先生是爱好和平、民主的中国人民的一个杰出的代表。她为了和平民主事业进行了长期的坚决的斗争，和伟大的毛泽东主席所领导的全国人民在一道，进行了艰苦卓越的斗争。这种斗争，是在伟大的斯大林旗帜下进行的，是以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营保卫和平斗争的一部分。宋庆龄先生荣获斯大林国际奖金，是她个人的光荣，也是中国人民的光荣。
    现在，全世界人民保卫和平的斗争，正处在紧要的时期。一方面，和平国家的阵营已经空前壮大，资本主义国家和殖民地，半殖民地国家的人民的保卫和平运动正在高涨；另一方面，全世界人民的敌人——美国帝国主义和它的仆从们为了加紧公开准备新的世界战争，已经开始恢复日本的军国主义，开始重新武装西德，并且违反国际协定和人类正义，匆忙地蛮不讲理地签订了美制对日和约，恬不知耻地公开破坏朝鲜停战谈判，坚持它对朝鲜和对于我国的侵略。但是，帝国主义者这种垂死的挣扎，决不能挽回他们的失败。相反的，帝国主义各国内部的矛盾正在日益尖锐化，帝国主义各国统治集团之间的分化和相互间的斗争也正在日益激烈化。同时，他们挑拨世界战争、破坏世界和平及扩大侵略的罪行，已经引起这些帝国主义国家本国的人民和被侵略国家人民日益增涨的不满，因而使战争贩子们日益陷于孤立。因此，我们可以断言，它们必将遭遇到愈来愈严重的困难；必将遭遇到保卫和平的人民所给予的愈来愈沉重的打击。
    我国人民是热爱和平的。我们为了祖国的和平民主事业，为了保卫远东和世界的和平民主事业，在八年抗日战争中，在反对美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的斗争中，在抗美援朝的斗争中，已经作了伟大的贡献；在抗日战争时期，我们曾遭受过难以用数目字来计算，也难以用言语来形容的巨大的损失。因此，我们对于一切有关远东和世界和平的问题，特别是关于制订对日和约问题，具有任何人所不能否认的参与准备和参与决定权。一切无视我国这种权利的非法行为和企图，都是我们全国人民所一致反对的。必将遭受到它所应受的打击。
    我们为了保卫世界和平，保卫我们祖国的安全，正在万众一心地进行着伟大的抗美援朝斗争，我国人民志愿军参加朝鲜前线作战以来，已经配合朝鲜人民军歼灭了美李侵略军三十余万，其中有美军十四万。全国人民为了抗美援朝已经热烈地捐献了数以千计的飞机。目前，全国抗美援朝运动，正在继续深入和发展着，我们坚信我们一定能够使朝鲜战争胜利地结束。
    现在，我国人民保卫和平的力量正在迅速地继续壮大着，全世界保卫和平的力量也正在迅速地继续壮大着。我们可以断言：世界的历史，一定是按照着爱好和平人民的意志前进的，一定不是按照战争贩子们的妄想前进的，最后的胜利一定属于保卫和平的世界人民。和平一定会战胜战争。
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营胜利万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
