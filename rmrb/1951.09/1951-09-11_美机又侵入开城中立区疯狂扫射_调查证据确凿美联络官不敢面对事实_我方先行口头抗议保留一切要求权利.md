Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th – At 1:35 PM on September 10th, another U.S. aircraft intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone and strafed the Manyue-ri area near the armistice negotiation site. This is the third serious provocative incident involving U.S. aircraft, following those on August 22nd and September 1st. After this strafing incident occurred, our side immediately lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side via radiotelephone, and subsequently delivered a written protest from our chief representative, General Nan Ri, to the U.S. side. After the U.S. liaison officer arrived, both sides departed at 9:45 AM to conduct a joint investigation, which concluded at 1:40 PM. The investigation results proved that three houses were struck by machine gun fire from U.S. aircraft, with a total of twenty bullet marks: seven on the walls, three at the base of the walls, three piercing the houses, and seven in the vegetable garden. Ten bullet casings and bullets were discovered. During the investigation, the U.S. liaison officer attempted to deny the responsibility for the U.S. aircraft's strafing, claiming that someone may have been shooting from the rooftops, rather than from the aircraft. However, after questioning three homeowners, they all indicated that they heard the sound of an aircraft when they were being strafed. During the on-site investigation, U.S. aircraft repeatedly intruded into the airspace above the Kaesong Neutral Zone. The U.S. liaison officer brazenly lied on the spot, claiming that the U.S. aircraft were outside the airspace of the Kaesong Neutral Zone. After the investigation concluded, the two sides reconvened at the negotiation site at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The U.S. liaison officer, using the excuse that "this trip is only to investigate the facts and is unwilling to draw any conclusions," refused to face the conclusive evidence. At this time, our liaison officer also pointed out the U.S. aircraft machine gun casings found in Chengjunguan, north of Kaesong, proving on the spot that the casings and bullets were completely consistent. Our liaison officer immediately pointed out that both witness testimony and physical evidence have proven the fact that the other party's aircraft carried out the strafing. And declared: On behalf of our chief representative, General Nan Ri, I would like to lodge a preliminary verbal protest to the other party, and reserve all rights to make demands.

    美机又侵入开城中立区疯狂扫射
    调查证据确凿美联络官不敢面对事实
    我方先行口头抗议保留一切要求权利
    【新华社开城十日电】九月十日一时三十五分，又有美国飞机一架侵入开城中立区，并在停战谈判会址区附近的满月里地方施行扫射。这是继八月二十二日和九月一日两次事件后美国飞机又一次的严重挑衅事件。这次扫射事件发生后，我方即以无线电话向美方提出严重抗议，随后并以我方首席代表南日将军的书面抗议一件递交美方。美方联络官来到后，双方即于九时四十五分出发进行共同调查，一时四十分调查结束。调查的结果证明，共有房屋三间为美国飞机以机关枪射中，弹痕共有二十处，计墙上七处，墙根三处，洞穿房屋三处，菜园内七处，弹壳弹头共发现有十个。在调查时美方联络官力图狡赖美国飞机施行扫射的罪责，声称可能系有人在屋顶上射击，而非由飞机上扫射。但经过先后询问屋主三人，他们均指出被扫射时曾听见飞机响声。实地调查时，美国飞机又数次侵入开城中立区上空。美方联络官，竟当场撒谎，声称美方飞机系在开城中立区以外上空。调查结束后，下午三时双方在谈判会场复会。美方联络官以“此行仅在调查事实不愿作任何结论”为藉口，拒绝面对证据确凿的事实。此时我方联络官又指出另在开城以北城均馆地方所发现的美国飞机用以扫射的机关枪弹壳，当场证明，弹壳和弹头完全符合。我方联络官当即指出：人证物证均已证明对方飞机施行扫射的事实。并声明：奉我方首席代表南日将军之命，向对方先行口头抗议，并保留一切要求的权利。
