    In the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, alongside exposing the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, extensively and deeply publicizing Sino-Soviet friendship, and combining this with various different tasks to organize the masses to learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, is of great significance to raising the victorious confidence of the national people in the struggle against imperialism and promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Facts have proven that wherever attention is paid to publicizing Sino-Soviet friendship, the masses more profoundly recognize that the Soviet Union is a staunch bastion of world peace and a loyal friend of the Chinese people, thereby increasing their determination and confidence in resisting American aggression. In various tasks, the masses are also encouraged to learn from the Soviet example. For example, in participating in the movement of military cadre schools, many young people in Xifeng County, Liaodong Province, proposed to "learn from the Soviet hero Ilya and embark on the glorious post of defending the country." The nine hundred and sixty-three workers in Lingshan, Quyang County, Hebei, said in their oath to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association: "Since we are joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, we must become true defenders of peace. We must guarantee the realization of the patriotic pact, and we must follow the example of our Soviet comrades." Because the publicity of Sino-Soviet friendship has played a direct role in raising the political consciousness of the masses and promoting various tasks, various places have generally paid attention to this work.
    However, some places have not given sufficient attention to the publicity of Sino-Soviet friendship, or have not closely integrated the publicity of Sino-Soviet friendship with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. The former is manifested in: some places have not seized every opportunity to publicize Sino-Soviet friendship in a planned manner, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations of some organs and groups have not been able to play a greater organizational role. The latter is manifested in: although some places have paid attention to exposing the ugliness of the United States, they have not adequately publicized the strength of the Soviet Union and its peace policy, lacking planning and systematicness, and failing to sharply contrast the two major camps to educate the masses. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations in some places, because they are busy with general Resist America, Aid Korea work, have relaxed the propaganda and organizational work on Sino-Soviet friendship. In the great Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations in individual places are still busy with general picture exhibitions and other work, and have not closely integrated it with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. All these shortcomings are caused by a failure to correctly understand the relationship between the publicity of Sino-Soviet friendship and the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, and must be seriously overcome.
    Publicizing Sino-Soviet friendship is an important part of the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education movement. To do this work well, all regions, organs, groups, and units must work together and take action. Some people think that this is only the business of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. This view is wrong. There is no doubt that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is responsible for organizing and promoting this work; but the organization at all levels of this association and all other propaganda and education institutions also have the responsibility to promote this work, which is related to the highest interests of our country and people. To this end, all people's organizations and other units should quickly establish and improve the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Working Committee, and establish regular work to publicize Sino-Soviet friendship. On May 3 this year, the headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, together with various people's organizations, issued a notice on working together to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship work in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Since then, some people's organizations have established Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Working Committees and started work in accordance with the spirit of the notice; however, many groups have not paid more attention to this work, and have not more actively mobilized their members to participate in various activities of Sino-Soviet friendship. This situation should be changed quickly.
    In the work of publicizing Sino-Soviet friendship, we believe that local newspapers should play an important role. They should systematically publicize the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and its great achievements in peaceful construction, as well as its loyal and selfless assistance to the Chinese people, and contrast this with the imperialist camp's policy of aggression, darkness and corruption, and consistent aggression against China, in order to effectively educate the people. At the same time, we should widely introduce the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in various construction undertakings, widely publicize the cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union and the activities of the broad masses of members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various parts of our country, in order to enhance Sino-Soviet friendship.
    Secondly, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various places should fully mobilize their organizations at all levels (that is, not just send a few cadres), closely combine with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, strengthen the publicity of Sino-Soviet friendship, and overcome the bias of only being busy with general affairs work and relaxing the publicity of Sino-Soviet friendship, so that the publicity work of Sino-Soviet friendship is regularized. And through in-depth publicity and education work, a large number of Sino-Soviet Friendship Association members should be developed. Some people who do not understand the mass line, who only know how to work hard on their own on weekdays, but do not know how to assign specific tasks to the broad masses of members and lead them to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship work, think that there are few Sino-Soviet Friendship Association cadres, and the more members there are, the more difficult it is. This view is wrong and should be corrected.

    结合抗美援朝运动，加强关于中苏友好的宣传
    在抗美援朝运动中，与揭露美帝国主义的侵略阴谋同时，广泛深入地宣传中苏友好，并结合各种不同的业务，组织群众学习苏联的先进经验，对提高全国人民反对帝国主义斗争的胜利信心和推进抗美援朝运动，都有极大的意义。事实证明，凡是注意宣传中苏友好的地方，群众就更深刻地认识了苏联是世界和平的坚强堡垒，是中国人民的忠诚朋友，因而提高了反对美国侵略的决心和信心。在各种工作中，群众也都以学习苏联的榜样来鼓励自己。例如在参加军事干部学校的运动中，辽东省西丰县的许多青年都提出要“学习苏联英雄依里亚，走上卫国保家的光荣岗位上去”。河北曲阳县灵山的九百六十三个工人，在参加中苏友好协会的誓词中说：“既然参加中苏友好协会，就要成为一个真正的和平保卫者。我们要保证爱国公约的实现，我们要向苏联的工友们看齐。”由于宣传中苏友好已对提高群众的政治觉悟，推动各种工作起了直接的作用，所以各地一般都注意了这一工作。
    但是也有些地方，对宣传中苏友好还没有给予足够的重视，或者没有把宣传中苏友好与抗美援朝运动密切结合起来。前者表现为：有些地方没有抓住每一时机，有计划地宣传中苏友好，若干机关、团体的中苏友协组织还未能发挥其更大的组织作用。后者表现为：有些地方虽然注意了揭露美国的丑恶，却对苏联的强大力量以及她的和平政策宣传不够，缺乏计划性、系统性，不善于尖锐地对比两大阵营，以教育群众。有些地方的中苏友协组织，因为忙于一般的抗美援朝工作，放松了关于中苏友好的宣传和组织工作，个别地方的中苏友协组织在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，仍然忙于一般的图片展览等工作，而没有使之与抗美援朝运动密切结合起来。所有这些缺点，都是因为没有正确认识宣传中苏友好与抗美援朝运动的关系而产生的，必须认真加以克服。
    宣传中苏友好，是抗美援朝宣传教育运动的重要内容之一。要作好这一工作，必须各地区、各机关、各团体、各单位群策群力，一齐动手。有人认为这只是中苏友协的事情，这种看法是不对的。毫无疑问，中苏友协要负责组织和推动这一工作；但本会各级组织和其他一切宣传教育机构也有责任推行这一关系我们国家和人民最高利益的工作。为此，各人民团体及其他单位应该很快建立与健全中苏友协工作委员会的组织，并建立经常宣传中苏友好的工作。今年五月三日，中苏友好协会总会曾联合各人民团体，发布了关于结合抗美援朝运动，协力开展中苏友好工作的通知。此后，有些人民团体根据通知的精神，建立了中苏友协工作委员会，展开了工作；但许多团体还没有对这一工作给以更大的注意，没有更积极地发动自己的会员参加中苏友好的各种活动。这种状况应该迅速加以改变。
    在宣传中苏友好的工作中我们认为各地报刊应起重要的作用，它们应当有计划地宣传苏联的和平外交政策及其和平建设的伟大成就，以及对中国人民忠诚无私的援助，以之与帝国主义阵营的侵略政策、黑暗腐朽及始终侵略中国对照起来，借以有效地教育人民群众。同时，应该广泛地介绍苏联在各种建设事业中的先进经验，广泛地宣传中苏两国文化的交流以及我国各地中苏友协广大会员群众的活动，借以增进中苏友谊。
    其次，各地中苏友好协会，应把自己的各级组织充分动员起来（即不是只派出几个干部），密切结合抗美援朝运动，加强中苏友好的宣传，克服只忙于一般的事务工作，而放松中苏友好宣传的偏向，使中苏友好的宣传工作经常化。并经过深入的宣传教育工作，大量发展中苏友协会员。有些不懂得走群众路线，平日只知自己努力工作，却不知给广大会员分配具体工作，并领导他们开展中苏友好工作的人认为中苏友协干部很少，会员越多越没办法。这种看法是错误的，应加以纠正。
