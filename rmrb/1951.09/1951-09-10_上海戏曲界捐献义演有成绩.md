    Shanghai Opera Circle's Donation Performance Achieves Results
    Under the leadership of the "Shanghai Literary and Art Circles Support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Branch," the Shanghai opera circle enthusiastically launched a donation performance movement in response to the June 1st call, to donate airplanes and cannons. From July 17th, in just a month and a half, thirteen opera genres (Beijing Opera, Shanghai Opera, Yue Opera, Jianghuai Opera, Pingtan, Comic Opera, Changxi Opera, Magic and Dance, Northern Jiangsu Storytelling and Drumming, Shanghai Storytelling, Yangzhou Opera, Cantonese Opera, Street Performers) have given over two hundred charity performances, donating 1.5 billion RMB and completing the task of donating the first fighter plane.
    The most touching thing in this movement is the enthusiasm and efforts of the veteran artists. Veteran artists from Beijing Opera, Shanghai Opera, Pingtan, and acrobatics took the lead in performing, setting a good example. Female artists are gloriously walking in the front of the movement. The Pingtan circle not only performed charity performances, but also organized propaganda teams to go deep into the neighborhoods to promote the cause. These performances show the love of the liberated Shanghai opera artists for the great motherland and the love for the Chinese People's Volunteers who defend peace.
    There are also some shortcomings in the movement. The main one is that the seriousness of some performance content is not enough. Beijing Opera once jokingly performed cross-dressing; the joint charity performance of Shanghai Opera exaggerated the backward and dark side of the petty bourgeoisie; the joint charity performance of Yue Opera was also incomplete in art and had a tendency of formalism. Of course, compared to the achievements, these shortcomings are secondary and are being improved.

    上海戏曲界捐献义演有成绩
    上海戏曲界在“上海文艺界抗美援朝支会”的领导下，热烈展开了响应六一号召、捐献飞机大炮的义演运动。自七月十七日起，不过一个半月时间，已有十三个剧种（京剧、沪剧、越剧、江淮剧、评弹、滑稽、常锡戏、魔技歌舞、苏北评话鼓书、沪书、维扬戏、粤戏、街头艺人）义演二百多场，捐献了人民币十五亿元，完成了第一架战斗机的任务。
    在这次运动中最动人的事例，是老艺人们的热情与努力。京剧、沪剧、评弹和杂技界的老艺人，都率先演出，起了良好的带头作用。女艺人们更是光荣地走在运动的前面。评弹界不仅义演，而且组织宣传队深入里弄宣传。这些表现了翻了身的上海戏曲艺人们对伟大祖国的热爱，对保卫和平的中国人民志愿军的热爱。
    在运动中也有着一些缺点，主要的是若干演出内容的严肃性不够。京戏曾玩笑地反串演出；沪剧的联合义演过分夸张了小市民落后阴暗的一面；越剧的联合义演在艺术上也是不完整的，有公式主义的倾向。当然，比起成绩来，这些缺点是次要的，而且也在改进之中。
