Supplying the Large Needs of Various Industries, Transportation, Water Conservancy, and Agriculture
This Year, China's Machine Industry is Unprecedentedly Prosperous
Promoting High-Speed Cutting Methods Will Greatly Improve Production Levels

From 1950 to 1951, China's machine industry experienced an important transformation process, from having no work to becoming busy, from chaos and fragmentation to being more connected and organized, and from being basically a repair industry to being able to manufacture complete sets of machines.

This year, the machine industry has seen an unprecedented boom in Chinese history. In the North China region, both public and private machine factories were the quietest last year, but this year they have been running at full capacity, and some private factories are so busy that they often work overtime day and night. In the Northeast region, state-owned factories had product backlogs last year, but this year they have not only sold out their inventories, but even running two shifts day and night feels insufficient to meet the needs. Factories in East China, especially private ones, called on the government for support last year, but this year the orders are so crowded that even orders for next spring and even summer are fully booked. The production value of the national state-owned machine industry in the first half of this year has reached 90 percent of the total for last year. The total number of employees in state-owned machine factories increased by 23 percent at the end of June this year compared to the end of last year. Private factories have not only increased workers in their original factories, but also opened many new ones. As for labor productivity, just in terms of the state-owned sector, it increased by 46 percent in the first half of this year compared to last year, and will certainly increase further in the second half of the year.

Over the past year, the machine industry has made very significant contributions to the national economy.

For railway construction, the machine industry supplied water supply equipment such as boiler feed pumps and water cranes, repair equipment such as axle drop supports, and common materials such as passenger cars, freight cars, flat cars, and dump trucks. The supply of these products is very large. It is particularly worth mentioning that the machine industry has begun to produce diesel pile drivers needed for bridge construction, mobile air compressors needed on construction sites, track inspection motorcycles for track inspection, and essential products for controlling trains, very precise and difficult-to-make train air brakes, and train wheel axles of extremely high quality requirements.

For water conservancy projects, the machine industry supplied a large number of drainage pumps and cement mixers used on construction sites, and the most outstanding complete set of steel gates weighing more than 1,400 tons manufactured for the Huai River project.

For the textile industry, the production of complete sets of cotton spinning machines, from opening to fine spinning, has begun this year, with a large quantity. This year, the manufacture of flax spinning machines has also begun.

For mines, this year more varieties of machines have been supplied, such as various lift pumps, various capacity air compressors, various types of blowers, as well as high-quality rock drills and pneumatic shovels. In addition, coal cutting machines, drilling machines, and small locomotives have been trial-manufactured.

For agriculture, a large number of farm tools, a large number of new-style waterwheels, and a large number of irrigation pumps have been manufactured. What is particularly important is that completely self-made tractors have appeared.

For transportation, this year supplied an unprecedented number of auto parts, and manufactured high-quality cylinder parts, batteries, and spark plugs and other difficult-to-make equipment. This year, complete cars and motorcycle bicycles have also been produced, allowing us to see the budding of our own automobile manufacturing industry.

In order to widely supply the needs of factories, mines, and agricultural production, this year the machine industry produced various power machines, such as 300-horsepower stationary diesel engines, 100-horsepower mobile diesel engines, large steam engines, new-style boilers, various gasoline engines, and various coal gas engines.

Machine tools are one of the main products of the machine manufacturing industry. This year, thousands of machine tools have been produced. These include casting molding machines, air hammers, steam hammers, shears, punches, presses, all-gear lathes, heavy-duty lathes for turning steel rolling rollers, hexagonal lathes, vertical lathes, automatic lathes, screw machines, universal milling machines, electric shapers, large gantry planers 5 meters long, horizontal boring machines, precision universal grinders, etc. In addition, many difficult-to-make machines have been produced, such as high-vacuum vacuum pumps, hydraulic presses, and long-web paper machines. Many of these machine tools and machines are fine products that have been manufactured this year after multiple trials.

In addition to large machines, this year also produced various fine tools and instruments, such as various ball bearings, various hobbing cutters, micrometers, and standard gauge blocks. These products are sufficient to show that our manufacturing level has been considerably improved.

The above are just a few of the major aspects of the machine industry's contribution this year. According to incomplete statistics, more than 270 new products have been produced by the national machine industry by the end of June, and new products are continuing to be produced after June.

In order to supply the greater demands for machines from industry and agriculture when the high tide of economic construction arrives, the Northeast machine industry has universally promoted the Soviet high-speed cutting method, and since May this year, it has also begun to be promoted in various parts of China proper. According to materials from various places, the efficiency of machine tools using the high-speed cutting method has increased by five to six times to more than twenty times. The production efficiency of the Tianjin Machine Factory and the Tianjin Auto Parts Factory, which have widely promoted the high-speed cutting method, has increased by two times throughout the factory. There is no doubt that after the Soviet high-speed cutting method is universally promoted in our country, the production level of our machine industry will be greatly improved.

    供应各种工业和交通、水利、农业的大量需要
    今年我国机器工业空前繁荣
    推行高速切削法将使生产水平飞跃提高
    从一九五○年到一九五一年，中国机器工业经历了重要的转变过程，从没有活作变成忙碌起来，从紊乱和零散转到联系和组织得比较紧凑，从基本上是修配业进到了能够制造成套的机器。
    今年，机器工业出现了中国历史上空前的繁荣景象。华北区的公私营机器厂，去年是生意最清淡的，今年已经开足了工，有些私营工厂还忙得经常日夜加班。东北区的国营工厂在去年还有产品积压现象，今年不仅已经把库存产品卖光，而且开了昼夜两班还感到赶不上需要。华东的工厂，特别是私营的，去年吁请政府扶助，今年的订货却挤得连明年春季、甚至夏季的订货都排满了。全国国营机器业的生产价值，今年上半年已经达到去年全年的百分之九十。国营机器厂的职工总数，今年六月底比去年年底增加了百分之二十三。私营工厂不但原来的工厂增加了工人，而且开业家数也很多。至于劳动生产率，单就国营方面的说，今年上半年比去年提高了百分之四十六，下半年当然还要提高一些。
    一年来，机器工业对于国民经济所作的贡献非常巨大。
    对于修建铁道，机器工业供给了给水设备如锅炉给水泵、水鹤之类，修车设备如落轴支重机，常用器材如客车、货车、平车、斗车等等。这些产品的供给量都是很大的。特别值得提出的是，机器工业已开始出产建桥所需的柴油打桩机、工地需用移动式空气压缩机、查路用的查道摩托车和控制火车的必需品、非常精密难作的火车风闸、品质要求极高的火车轮轴等。
    对于水利工程，机器工业供给了大量的排水泵和工地上用的洋灰搅拌机，和最出色的为治淮工程制造的，重达一千四百多吨的整套钢铁闸门。
    对于纺织工业，今年开始出产了完整的成套的棉纺机，从清花到精纺，无不俱备，并且数量很大。今年又开始制造了麻纺机。
    对于矿山，今年供给了品种更多的机器，像各种扬程水泵、各种容量的空气压缩机、各种型式的鼓风机，还有品质很好的凿岩机和风铲等等。除此以外，并且试制出来了割煤机、钻探机和小机车。
    对于农业，制造了大批的农具，大批的新式水车，和数目很大的灌溉水泵。特别重要的是完全自制的拖拉机已经出现。
    对于交通事业，这一年供给了空前多的汽车配件，制造出了品质优良的汽缸配件、电瓶和火花塞等难作的器材。今年并出产了整部的汽车和摩托脚踏车，使我们看到了自己的汽车制造业的萌芽。
    为了广泛地供应工厂、矿山和农业生产的需要，今年机器业生产了各种动力机，如三百匹马力的固定式柴油机、一百匹马力的移动式柴油机、大型的蒸汽机、新式锅炉、各式汽油机和各式煤汽机。
    工作母机是机器制造业的主要生产品之一。今年出产了数以千计的工具机。这里面有铸造制型机、空气锤、蒸气锤、剪机、铳机、压力机、全齿轮车床、重型车制轧钢辊子的大车床、六角车床、立式车床、自动车床、螺丝机、万能铣床、电动牛头刨床、五公尺长的大龙门刨床、横摚床、精密万能磨床等。另外还出产了不少难做的机器，如真空度很高的真空泵、水压机、长网式造纸机等。这些机床和机器很多都是在今年经过多次试制而后制成的精良出品。
    除开大型机器以外，今年还出产了各种精细的工具仪表，如各种滚珠轴承、各种滚刀、千分尺和标准量块等。这些出品都足以说明我们的制造水平已有相当的提高。
    以上这一些，只是机器工业今年所作贡献的几个主要方面。据不完全的统计，全国机器工业的新产品，到六月底已经在二百七十种以上，六月以后，新产品还在继续出产着。
    为了供应经济建设高潮到来时工农业对于机器的更大量的要求，东北机器工业已经普遍地推行了苏联的高速切削法，今年五月以后关内各地也开始推行。根据各地材料，采用高速切削法的机床的效率已提高五、六倍到二十几倍，广泛推行高速切削法的天津机器厂和天津汽车制配厂全厂的生产效率已提高了两倍。无疑问的，苏联高速切削法在我国普遍推行后，我国机器工业的生产水平就将飞跃地提高一步。（新华社）
