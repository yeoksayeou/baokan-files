    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th. While the United States is convening the San Francisco Conference in an attempt to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, it has instructed its Japanese lackey, the Yoshida government, to illegally order the arrest of eighteen Japanese Communist Party leaders, headed by Shiino Etsuro, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party Provisional Central Guidance Department, on the 4th. This is another serious atrocity committed by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries since the illegal "purge" of all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on June 6th of last year, in violation of the Potsdam Proclamation regarding the encouragement of democratic forces in Japan.
    The Yoshida government's excuse for arresting the JCP leaders is that the JCP is "engaging in anti-occupation activities." The Yoshida government insists that the JCP's opposition to a separate peace treaty and rearmament is a "crime." As of the 4th, those illegally arrested include JCP Central Committee alternate member Iwata Eiichi, Sakanma Ichiro (member of the House of Representatives), JCP Inspector Yamanobe Kentaro, Councilor Hosokawa Karo, Representative Kamimura Susumu, as well as Horie Muraichi and Fukumoto Kazuo, seven people in total. The police are continuing to search for the other eleven. At the same time, agents and police of the Yoshida government also searched the JCP Provisional Central Guidance Department in Tokyo and regional committees throughout the country, as well as the residences of Shiino Etsuro and others.
    Since MacArthur illegally "purged" all twenty-four members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, headed by Tokuda Kyuichi, on June 6th of last year, the attacks and persecution of the vanguard of the Japanese working class—the Japanese Communist Party—by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have become increasingly intensified. Communist Party members of parliament, such as Todoro Katsumi, Taniguchi Zentarou, and Kawakami Kanichi, have been illegally "purged" or deprived of their seats. Thousands of JCP members and other progressive workers have been dismissed from various business sectors. More than 1,700 progressive newspapers and periodicals, including the JCP Central Committee's organ, Akahata, have been shut down. Simultaneously with the closure of newspapers and periodicals, the reactionaries took the opportunity to arrest JCP members and other progressive people on a large scale. However, the Japanese Communist Party and democratic forces have not retreated in the slightest because of this. Under the leadership of the JCP, the movement of the Japanese people against separate peace and rearmament is growing stronger. On the eve of the San Francisco Conference, this patriotic movement is surging, seriously striking at the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to conclude a separate peace. The purpose of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in launching this new atrocity on the opening day of the San Francisco Conference is clearly to attempt to break up the leadership organs of the JCP once again, and to suppress the angry protests of the Japanese people against the signing of the U.S.-British treaty with Japan. However, this action by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries only exposes their fear in the face of the increasingly powerful people's forces, and will surely arouse more powerful opposition from the Japanese people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th. The Japanese Communist Party parliamentary group lodged a strong protest with the Yoshida government on the 4th, protesting the Yoshida government's illegal order on the 4th to arrest eighteen Japanese Communist Party leaders such as Shiino Etsuro. The protest accused the mass arrest of JCP leaders as a "conspiracy by the Yoshida government to suppress the opposition party in order to force the American-made treaty upon the Japanese people." The protest pointed out: "Shigeru Yoshida and his subordinates are attempting to use force to suppress the people's fervent hope for an overall peace treaty." The protest declared: The Japanese Communist Party stands at the forefront of the Japanese people, fighting for the liberation of the Japanese people from the shackles of imperialism, and is prepared to fight the Japanese reactionary forces to the end.
    The protest was delivered to the Ministry of Justice, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office, and the police station by JCP members of the House of Representatives Kazahaya Hachijuni and Karasawa Toshiko.

### 美日反动派在旧金山会议开幕日制造新的暴行  竟非法下令逮捕椎野悦郎等日共领袖  日共国会议员团向吉田提出强硬抗议

    美日反动派在旧金山会议开幕日制造新的暴行
    竟非法下令逮捕椎野悦郎等日共领袖
    日共国会议员团向吉田提出强硬抗议
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：美国在召开旧金山会议企图缔结单独对日和约的同时，竟指使其日本走狗吉田政府，在四日非法下令逮捕以日本共产党临时中央指导部主席椎野悦郎为首的十八名日共领袖。这是美、日反动派自去年六月六日非法“整肃”日本共产党全体中央委员以来，违反波茨坦公告关于鼓励日本民主势力的规定的又一严重暴行。
    吉田政府逮捕日共领袖的藉口是日共“从事反占领活动”，吉田政府硬说日共反对单独和约和重新武装的活动是“犯罪”。截至四日为止，被非法逮捕的有日共中央委员会候补委员岩田英一、砂间一良（众议员），日共监察委员山边健太郎，参议员细川嘉六，众议员上村进，以及堀江邑一和福本和夫七人。警察对其他十一人正在继续搜捕中。同时，吉田政府的特务和警察还搜查了东京日共临时中央指导部和全国各地区委员会以及椎野悦郎等人的住宅。
    自去年六月六日麦克阿瑟非法“整肃”以德田球一为首的日本共产党全体二十四名中央委员以来，美、日反动派对日本工人阶级先锋队——日本共产党的进攻和迫害，就日益变本加厉。国会中的共产党议员听涛克己、谷口善太郎和川上贯一先后被非法“整肃”或褫夺议席。成千的日共党员及其他进步职工被从各个企业部门解雇。包括日共中央机关报赤旗报在内的进步报刊，被封闭的达一千七百家以上。与封闭报刊同时，反动派并乘机大肆逮捕日共党员和其他进步人士。但是，日本共产党和民主力量并不因此而有丝毫畏缩。在日共领导下，日本人民反对单独媾和与重新武装的运动日益壮大。在旧金山会议召开的前夕，这一爱国运动更是汹涌澎湃，严重地打击美、日反动派单独媾和的阴谋。美、日反动派在旧金山会议开幕日发动这次新的暴行，其目的显然是妄图再次打散日共的领导机关，压制日本全国人民对签订美英对日和约的愤怒抗议。但是，美、日反动派这种行动，只是暴露出它们在日益强大的人民力量面前的恐惧，必将激起日本人民更有力的反对。
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：日本共产党国会议员团四日向吉田政府提出强硬抗议，抗议吉田政府四日非法下令逮捕椎野悦郎等日本共产党十八名领袖。抗议书斥责大批逮捕日共领袖是吉田“政府镇压反对党的阴谋，以便强使日本人民接受美制和约”。抗议书指出：“吉田茂及其部属正企图用武力压制人民对全面和约的热烈希望”。抗议书宣称：日本共产党站在日本人民的前列，为从帝国主义的束缚下解放日本人民而斗争，并准备与日本反动势力斗争到底。
    抗议书是由日共众议员风早八十二和柄泽敏子递交法务府、东京市区检察署以及警察局的。
