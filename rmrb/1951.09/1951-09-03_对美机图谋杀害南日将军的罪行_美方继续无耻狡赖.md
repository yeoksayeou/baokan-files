Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 2nd: A special correspondent for this agency reports: The incident on the morning of September 1st at 00:30 where U.S. military aircraft bombed the Kaesong Neutral Zone was yet another premeditated and vicious plot by the U.S. side to murder our delegation's chief representative, General Nam Il. The two bombs dropped by U.S. military aircraft in this surprise attack landed in the rice paddies and hills south of Damiao Dong, near Bingku Dong, two and a half miles northeast of Kaesong, only 600 meters from the residence of our chief representative. As a result of the investigation conducted on the same day by reporters accompanying liaison officers from both sides to the scene, it was discovered that the bombs dropped by the U.S. aircraft were medium-sized explosive fragmentation bombs. The craters left by the bombs upon explosion were five meters in diameter and one meter deep, with the bomb casing being 6.7 millimeters thick. The bombs dropped by U.S. aircraft on the night of the 22nd were small fragmentation bombs, but this time they used medium-sized explosive fragmentation bombs. The U.S. side's vicious plot to murder our chief representative is now even more clearly exposed. After dropping bombs at 00:30 on September 1st, U.S. aircraft continuously intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone eight more times and circled over the bombing site. These eight intrusions occurred at: 01:35, 01:50, 02:05, 02:10, 02:55, 03:00, 03:10, and 05:15. Our liaison officers, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, notified the U.S. liaison officers of the above bombing and intrusion situation via radio telephone at 05:45, urging the other side to come to the scene for investigation immediately. After several urgings, approximately four hours later, U.S. liaison officers Colonel Kinney and Major Mulloy led an investigation team, accompanied by several U.S. reporters, to the scene. This investigation began at 10:40 and ended at 12:30. At 13:37 in the afternoon, liaison officers from both sides exchanged opinions on the investigation results, and the meeting adjourned at 14:30. Throughout the entire investigation process, the U.S. liaison officers, as in the previous investigation (on the night of the 22nd), tried in every possible way to quibble about their crimes. Kinney asserted from the outset that the bomb craters may have been the result of exploding fuses placed in the ground, and there was no evidence to prove that the craters were caused by bombs dropped from aircraft. Our liaison officers collected fragments of the bombs and pointed out conclusive evidence such as the craters and the surrounding new soil, the smoke-blackened crops, and the pierced trees, questioning Kinney: If this wasn't caused by bombs, what was it? Local residents Liu Yansun, Cao Taifu, Li Jingchun, and Li Heji also clearly testified that they all clearly heard the sound of aircraft dropping bombs at the time, and that the aircraft circled overhead after dropping the bombs before flying south. At this point, even the extremely cunning Kinney had to admit that the traces were caused by bombs dropped from military aircraft.

After Kinney's pre-prepared quibbles were refuted by irrefutable facts, he continued to quibble. Kinney's quibbles were full of contradictions. At one point, he said: The United Nations Command radar station did detect an "unidentified" aircraft operating in the area at the time and place of this morning's bombing. But then he said: If it was indeed bombed by an aircraft, then it was your aircraft that did it. His only reason was the so-called "United Nations Command does not know the location of General Nam Il's residence." Kinney's absurd and preposterous nonsense about the Chinese and Korean side's own aircraft bombing its own chief representative cannot deceive anyone. As for Kinney's quibble that the U.S. side did not know the new location of General Nam Il, after our liaison officers cited the fact that U.S. aircraft had continuously intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone and carried out reconnaissance since August 22nd, Kinney had no answer and finally said unreasonably: "Obviously, the conclusions of both sides will not be the same." The liaison officers of our delegation have written a report on the results of this investigation and interviews with local residents, which will soon be published to the world. During the investigation, our liaison officers requested the other side to proofread the interview records. The U.S. liaison officer's answer was: "I have no interest in your records." This fully exposes the U.S. side's rogue attitude of daring not face the facts and insisting on unreasonable denial.

    对美机图谋杀害南日将军的罪行
    美方继续无耻狡赖
    【新华社开城二日电】本社特派记者报道：九月一日清晨零时三十分美国军用飞机轰炸开城中立区的事件，是美方又一次图谋杀害我方代表团首席代表南日将军的有计划的毒辣阴谋。美方军用飞机在此次偷袭中投掷的两枚炸弹，落于开城东北二英里半冰库洞附近大庙洞以南的稻田和山坡上，两弹距我方首席代表住处仅六百公尺。记者当日随双方联络官赴现场调查结果，发现此次美机投掷之炸弹为中型爆炸杀伤弹，炸弹落地后爆炸之弹坑直径为五公尺，深达一公尺，弹皮厚者为六点七公厘。上次美机于二十二日夜投掷之炸弹为小型杀伤弹，此次则改用中型爆炸杀伤弹。美方居心杀害我方首席代表的毒辣阴谋，至此更加清楚地暴露出来。美机于九月一日零时三十分投掷炸弹后，又接连八次侵入开城中立区上空，并在轰炸地点上空盘旋。这八次侵袭时间为：一时三十五分，一时五十分，二时零五分，二时十分，二时五十五分，三时，三时十分，五时十五分。我方联络官张春山上校柴成文中校于五时四十五分将上述轰炸及侵袭情况以无线电话通知美方联络官，促请对方即来现场调查。经过数次催促，约四小时后，美方联络官肯尼上校穆莱上校才率一调查组并随带美方记者数人前来，这次调查从十时四十分开始，到十二时三十分结束。下午一时三十七分，双方联络官就调查结果交换意见，至二时三十分散会。美方联络官在整个调查过程中和在上次（二十二日夜里）调查时一样，多方为自己的罪行进行诡辩。肯尼一开始就认定：炸弹坑可能是在地内放置炸弹用引线爆炸的结果，并无证据证明是非飞机投掷的炸弹炸成的弹坑。我方联络官检取破碎的弹片并指出弹坑及其周围的新土、薰有黑烟的庄稼、被穿透的树木种种确凿的证据，责问肯尼：这不是炸弹炸的是什么？当地居民柳彦孙、曹泰福、李景春和李鹤姬四人亦确切证明，他们当时都清楚听到飞机投弹的响声，而且飞机投弹后曾在上空盘旋，以后才向南飞去。至此，就连狡诈无比的肯尼也不得不承认这是军用飞机投掷的炸弹所造成的痕迹。
    肯尼事先准备好的狡辩被铁的事实驳倒之后，仍继续进行狡辩。肯尼的狡辩矛盾百出。他一忽儿说：在今晨轰炸的地点和时间联合国军雷达站确侦得有一架“来历不明”的飞机在活动。但他一忽儿又说：如果确是飞机炸的，那也是你们的飞机炸的。他唯一的理由是所谓“联合国军并不知道南日将军的住处”。肯尼的这一套所谓中朝方面自己的飞机轰炸自己的首席代表的荒谬绝伦的鬼话，是决不能欺骗任何人的。至于肯尼所谓美方不知南日将军新址的诡辩，在我方联络官列举八月二十二日以后美机不断侵入开城中立区并实行侦察的事实后，肯尼也无言对答，最后只好横蛮无理地说：双方的结论显然是不会一样的。我方代表团联络官已将此次调查结果及向当地居民的访问写成报告，即将公布于世。在调查过程中，我方联络官曾提请对方将访问记录进行校对。美方联络官的回答是：“我对你们的记录没有兴趣。”这就充分暴露了美方不敢面对事实而坚持无理抵赖的无赖态度。
