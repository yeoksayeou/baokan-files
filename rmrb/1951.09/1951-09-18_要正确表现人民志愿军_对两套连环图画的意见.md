    To Correctly Depict the People's Volunteer Army
    -- Opinions on Two Sets of Serial Pictures

To the Editor:

    In the recently published seventh issue of "Lianhuanhua Bao" (Serial Picture Newspaper), there are two sets of serial pictures that I believe have errors and shortcomings. One set is "Fearless Warriors," compiled and drawn by Chen Xinghua, and the other is "Female Nurse Saves Wounded in Fire," compiled by Tang Dejian. "Fearless Warriors" depicts the heroic deeds of Li Chaoxing, a liberated farmer in Changbai Mountain, who joined the Volunteer Army to bravely fight the enemy. In this set of pictures, the author distorts the patriotic motivation for Li Chaoxing's heroic participation in this great struggle. The caption reads: "Li Chaoxing is a liberated farmer in Changbai Mountain on the banks of the Yalu River. Last year, he built several houses in preparation for marriage, but one afternoon, they were destroyed by American imperialist planes." As a result, he angrily went to his fiancée and said, "I want revenge! I want to join the Volunteer Army to kill the American devils!" Thus, Li Chaoxing joined the Volunteer Army and went to fight the American devils solely for this reason. In the author's writing, the world-renowned, just action of our Volunteer Army becomes merely an act to achieve personal revenge. This is a great distortion of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. As is well known, the reason our Volunteer Army can participate so heroically in the great struggle to support Korea is because they possess a lofty spirit of patriotism and internationalism. In order to defend the security of the motherland and world peace, and to repel the American imperialist aggression in Korea, they bravely and tenaciously fought the enemy. In extremely difficult circumstances, they were able to overcome difficulties with a revolutionary optimistic spirit and persevere until victory. How noble are their qualities! They are loved and respected by all the Chinese people and the people of the world, and "the most beloved people" has become their resounding name. The Chinese people are proud to have the Volunteer Army! However, the author has made a distorted depiction of these respectable and lovable people, which is very inappropriate. At a time when the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has deeply penetrated all parts of the country, and the patriotic and internationalist thinking of the people of the whole country has been unprecedentedly enhanced, touching deeds are emerging everywhere. The author is blind and deaf to these new thoughts and feelings generated among the people. This is a manifestation of the author's failure to delve deeply into the life of the masses' struggle.

    "Female Nurse Saves Wounded in Fire," compiled by Tang Dejian, depicts the heroic rescue of the wounded and diligent care of the wounded by Wang Ying (a Communist Party member), a female nurse in the Volunteer Army, on the battlefield. Once, a ward was bombed and set on fire by enemy planes. Although this ward was not Wang Ying's responsibility, she bravely rushed into the raging fire several times to rescue many wounded soldiers, and finally fainted. Therefore, her superiors awarded her a major merit. Such heroic behavior is indeed worthy of praise, but the author only captures some superficial phenomena for presentation, without expressing the essence of the hero from the character's thoughts and feelings, which makes the work extremely poor in ideological content. In the work, we can only see Wang Ying acting mechanically, and we cannot see her lofty inner activities. What is supporting her heroic behavior? Not a trace can be found in the picture. Such a heroic character does not give the reader a sense of intimacy at all. Such a work cannot achieve the purpose of educating the masses.

### 要正确表现人民志愿军——对两套连环图画的意见

    要正确表现人民志愿军
    ——对两套连环图画的意见编辑同志：
    最近出版的第七期“连环画报”上，有两套连环图画，我认为它们是有错误和缺点的。一套是陈兴华编绘的“无畏的勇士”，一套是唐德鉴编的“女护士火中救伤员”。“无畏的勇士”描写长白山中一个翻身农民李朝兴参加志愿军英勇杀敌的事迹。在这套画里，作者对李朝兴为什么英勇参加这一伟大斗争的爱国行动，作了歪曲的描写。画的说明这样写道：“李朝兴是鸭绿江边长白山中的一个翻身农民，去年盖了几间房子预备结婚，谁知一天下午，被美国鬼子的飞机炸毁了。”于是，他就气愤地去找他的未婚妻说：“我要报仇，我要参加志愿军去杀美国鬼子！”就这样，李朝兴仅仅为了这个原因便参加了志愿军，打美国鬼子去了。在作者笔下，我们举世闻名的志愿军的伟大的正义的行动，变成了仅仅为达到个人报仇的目的的行为，这对中国人民志愿军是很大的歪曲。如所周知，我们的志愿军所以能够英勇无比地参加支援朝鲜的伟大斗争，是因为他们具有崇高的爱国主义和国际主义的精神。他们为了要保卫祖国的安全，保卫世界和平，击退美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略，他们英勇地和顽强地同敌人作战，在极艰苦的环境里能以革命的乐观主义精神克服困难，坚持到斗争胜利，他们的品质是多么高贵呵！他们受到全中国人民，以及全世界人民的爱戴和尊敬，“最可爱的人”已经成为他们的响亮的名字。中国人民以有志愿军而感到骄傲！但是作者却对这些可敬可爱的人物作了歪曲的描写，这是很不应该的。在抗美援朝运动已经深入到全国各处，全国人民的爱国主义和国际主义的思想已空前提高的时候，到处都出现着感人的事迹，对于人民群众中产生的这种新的思想感情，作者竟不见不闻，这是作者不深入群众斗争生活的表现。
    唐德鉴编的“女护士火中救伤员”，描写一位志愿军的女护士王颖（共产党员），在战地里英勇地抢救伤员和辛勤地照顾伤员的事情。有一次，一个病房被敌机轰炸烧着了，虽然这个病房不是王颖负责的，但她却勇敢地冒着烈火几次冲进去抢救很多伤员，最后昏倒了。因此，上级给她记大功一次。这样英勇的行为，的确是值得歌颂的，但作者只抓取了一些表面现象加以陈述，而不从人物的思想、感情去表现英雄的本质，这使得作品的思想性极贫乏。我们在作品中只能看到王颖机械地活动着，看不到她的崇高的内心活动。究竟她的英勇行为是什么支持着的，在画里找不到一点踪迹。对这样一个英雄人物，使读者没有一点亲切之感，这样的作品是达不到教育群众的目的的。
