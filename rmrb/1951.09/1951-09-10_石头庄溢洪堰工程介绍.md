    Shitou Zhuang is located in Changyuan County, Pingyuan Province. The Yellow River here is historically the "bean curd waist," prone to breaches. The primary purpose of constructing a diversion weir here is to control excessively large floods on the Yellow River and alleviate the threat of flooding downstream.

    Since the people began to manage the Yellow River, the dikes have become stronger year by year. However, relying entirely on dikes to defend against floods has limited effectiveness. The current highest standard for flood defense by the Yellow River dikes is a flow of 18,000 cubic meters per second at Shaan County. However, according to past hydrological records, the Yellow River's flow at Shaan County reached 23,000 cubic meters per second in 1933, and 29,000 cubic meters per second in 1942 (although this peak was high, it was short in duration, and the flood volume was smaller than in 1933). Currently, our country is busy with production and construction. If the Yellow River were to experience a massive flood like those of 1933 or 1942, causing breaches and inundations, the impact would be significant. A breach on the north bank could lead to a change in course, flowing into the sea at Tianjin. A breach on the south bank would not only inundate vast plains, but also jeopardize the great project of harnessing the Huai River. To ensure that the Yellow River remains trouble-free, the only solution is to build flood storage reservoirs upstream. However, reservoirs cannot be built in the short term.

    Constructing a diversion weir at Shitou Zhuang is an effective way to prevent the Yellow River from causing trouble before upstream reservoirs are built. After this project is completed, it can guarantee that the Yellow River flood flow is 23,000 cubic meters per second at Shaan County, and strive to ensure that the Lin-Huang Dike and the Jin Dike do not collapse when the flow at Shaan County reaches 29,000 cubic meters per second. The diversion weir, also known as a spillway dam, is located on the north bank of the Yellow River, 1,500 meters long and 49 meters wide. The main weir is 2.9 meters high and is constructed using stone, sand, cement, wooden piles, and other materials. A control dike connected to the main dike is built along the front edge of the weir, which can withstand floods with a flow of 18,000 cubic meters per second or less. Once the flood flow exceeds 18,000 cubic meters per second, the control dike can be actively opened, diverting the excess flow from the diversion weir to reduce the burden on the river channel. This weir can divert a flow of 5,000 to 6,000 cubic meters per second, directing it to the area between the Lin-Huang Dike and the Jin Dike (the flood detention area) on the north bank of the Yellow River, and then back into the Yellow River between Zhang Zhuang and Taocheng Pu in Shouzhang County. It is approximately 160 kilometers from Shitou Zhuang to Taocheng Pu. The floodwater in the river channel takes only one and a half days to travel from Shitou Zhuang to Taocheng Pu. The diverted water flows more slowly, taking seven or eight days to reach Taocheng Pu. The Yellow River rises and falls quickly. Each time the water rises, the high water level only lasts for about three days. By the time the diverted floodwater reaches Taocheng Pu and rejoins the Yellow River, the water level in the Yellow River has already dropped, the tense situation has passed, and there will no longer be a serious threat to the downstream dikes.

    The work of building the diversion weir is also great and arduous. More than 45,000 technicians and laborers, and more than 2,000 cadres participated. The total amount of materials needed for the entire project weighed more than 250,000 tons, all transported from distant places such as Northeast China and Wuhan. Some residents in the flood detention area had to be relocated. For the benefit of the entire nation, they also supported this wise measure of the Central People's Government. The government has also made thorough arrangements for their relief and resettlement.

    In order to complete this huge project in a short period of more than three months to protect the construction of the people's motherland, all cadres and employees displayed a high degree of patriotic zeal. They braved the heat, disregarded the wind and rain, overcame all difficulties, and worked day and night. This great diversion weir was finally completed on August 20th.

    石头庄溢洪堰工程介绍
    新华社记者  君谦
    石头庄在平原省长垣县。黄河到这里正是历史上易于决口的“豆腐腰”。在这里修溢洪堰的主要目的，是控制黄河发生的过大洪水，解除下游的洪水威胁。
    自从人民治理黄河以来，堤防一年比一年更坚固。但是完全依靠堤防来防御洪水，其效能是有限制的。现在黄河堤防所能防御的洪水的最高标准是陕州流量一万八千秒公方，可是，根据过去水文记录，黄河在一九三三年，陕州的流量曾达到二万三千秒公方，一九四二年曾达到二万九千秒公方（这次水峰较高，可是时间较短，洪水量比一九三三年小）。现在我国正忙于生产建设，如果黄河发生一次像一九三三年或一九四二年那样巨大的洪水，闹出决口泛滥的乱子，那就影响很大。如果在北岸决口，可能改道到天津入海，如果在南岸决口，不只要淹没广大的平原，连根治淮河的伟大工程都有遭到失败的危险。要使黄河保证不出乱子，只有在上游修好蓄洪水库以后。但是，水库不是在短期内可以修成的。
    在石头庄修溢洪堰，就是在黄河上游修建水库以前，防止黄河出乱子的有效办法。这个工程完成以后，可以保证黄河洪水在陕州流量二万三千秒公方，并争取在陕州流量到二万九千秒公方的时候，确保临黄堤和金堤不溃决。溢洪堰又名滚水坝，在黄河北岸，长一千五百公尺，宽四十九公尺，主堰高二点九公尺，用石料、砂子、洋灰、木桩等工料筑成。堰的前沿筑有一条和大堤相接的控制堤，可挡一万八千秒公方以下的洪水。一旦洪水流量超过了一万八千秒公方，就可主动地开放控制堤，使超过的流量从溢洪堰分出，以减轻河槽的负担。这个堰能分出五千到六千秒公方的流量，使之流于黄河北岸临黄堤和金堤之间（滞洪区），到寿张县张庄和陶城铺之间，再归入黄河。石头庄到陶城铺约一百六十余公里，河槽里的洪水由石头庄到陶城铺只需一天半的时间。分出的水流得慢，到陶城铺需七八天的时间。黄河水涨得快也落得快，每次涨水，高水位的洪水不过持续三天左右，当分出的洪水到陶城铺再归入黄河时，黄河的水位已经下降，紧张的形势已成过去，对下游的堤坝已不致再有严重的威胁了。
    修溢洪堰的工作也是伟大而艰巨的，参加的技工和民工有四万五千多人，干部有两千多人，全部工程所需的工料共重二十五万吨以上，都是远从东北、武汉等地运来的。滞洪区中有部分居民须迁出，为了国家全体的利益，他们同样拥护中央人民政府这一英明的措施。政府对于他们也作了周密的救济和安置。
    为了在短促的三个多月内完成这个巨大工程，以保卫人民祖国的建设事业，全体干部、员工发挥了高度爱国主义热忱。他们不避酷热，不顾风雨，克服一切困难，日夜赶修。这个伟大的溢洪堰，终于在八月二十日全部修成了。
