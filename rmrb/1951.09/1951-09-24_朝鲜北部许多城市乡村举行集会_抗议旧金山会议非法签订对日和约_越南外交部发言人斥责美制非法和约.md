(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 22nd) According to TASS, Pyongyang, September 22nd: Many cities and villages in northern Korea are holding rallies to protest the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan signed at the San Francisco Conference. Resolutions passed at these rallies, and speeches delivered by workers, staff, farmers, and People's Army soldiers, expressed the great indignation of the entire Korean people towards this new conspiracy of the American imperialists against peace-loving people, especially against Japan's neighbors.

    The workers and staff congress of the factory headed by Kim Kuk-man (transliteration) passed a resolution saying: "After signing the peace treaty with Japan manufactured by the American imperialists, they want to legalize the revival of Japanese militarism and turn Japan into an aggressive country and their tool. Agreeing to this behavior is betraying humanity. That is why we, the ordinary people of Korea, strongly protest the peace treaty with Japan and will do everything in our power to prevent Japan from being transformed into a center of aggression in the Far East and a base for preparing another war against freedom-loving people."

    The resolution passed at a farmers' rally in a village in South Pyongan Province said: The peace treaty with Japan passed at the San Francisco Conference is a criminal act against our people. We want to join our voices of protest with the voices of all freedom-loving countries, and condemn the illegal actions of the US and British governments.

(Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 22nd) According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement at a press conference on the 18th, protesting the separate peace treaty with Japan signed by the US and British imperialists and their vassals and puppets, and declared this illegal treaty invalid. The spokesperson said: The separate peace treaty with Japan violates international agreements such as Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam, and violates the will of the Asian people and the legitimate interests of the Japanese people. The US and British imperialists signed this separate treaty with Japan for the purpose of preparing for a new war and reviving Japanese militarism. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world are sternly protesting this separate treaty.

    The spokesperson solemnly declared: "The Vietnamese people, who have suffered from the aggression of Japanese fascists, strongly protest this treaty and consider it nothing more than a scrap of paper. The Vietnamese people believe that the signature of the puppet Tran Van Huu is completely invalid."

    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社平壤二十二日讯：朝鲜北部的许多城市和乡村都在举行集会，抗议旧金山会议非法签订的单独对日和约。在这些集会上通过的决议，和工人与职员、农民及人民军战士所发表的演说，都表示出全体朝鲜人民对于美帝国主义者这种对爱好和平的人民，特别是针对日本邻国的新阴谋的极大愤慨。
    金国满（译音）任厂长的工厂工人与职员大会通过一项决议说：“美帝国主义者想在签订了他们制造的对日和约以后，把复活日本军国主义合法化，把日本变成一个侵略国家和他们的工具。同意这种行为就是出卖人类。这就是为什么我们朝鲜普通人民强烈抗议对日和约，并将竭尽全力不让日本被变为远东的侵略中心以及准备另一次反对爱好自由人民的战争基地。”
    在平安南道一个村的农民集会上通过的决议说：旧金山会议所通过的对日和约，是反对我国人民的罪恶行为。我们要把我们抗议的呼声和一切爱好自由的国家的呼声汇合在一起，斥责美英政府的非法行动。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南民主共和国外交部发言人于十八日在招待记者会上发表谈话，抗议美英帝国主义者及其附庸和傀儡所签订的单独对日和约，并声明这个非法的条约是无效的。发言人说：单独对日和约违反开罗、雅尔塔、波茨坦等国际协定，违反亚洲人民的意志和日本人民的正当利益。美英帝国主义者与日本签订这一单独和约，目的是准备新战争并复活日本军国主义。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民都严正抗议这个单独和约。
    发言人严正声明：“曾受日本法西斯主义者侵略之害的越南人民，强烈地抗议这个条约，认为它不过是一张废纸。越南人民认为傀儡陈文友的签字，完全无效。”
