A factory in Northeast China has achieved significant results in its quality inspection campaign. By mobilizing veteran workers and technicians, 91% of the identified problems have been quickly resolved. The factory's defective product rate in July decreased by 4.22% compared to the first half of the year. This alone results in monthly production increases and savings for the nation equivalent to the wealth of over 600 tons of grain. Furthermore, one particular technical improvement alone saves the nation over 160 million yuan monthly.

The factory's quality inspection campaign entered the problem-identification phase in early July. All employees submitted a total of 2,486 relatively important issues (statistics from two departments missing). After analysis and research by the administration, these were consolidated into 1,141 items and assigned to various departments for resolution.

Since most product quality defects were caused by shortcomings in technical operations, departments first adopted the Kovalev work method, incorporating the experience of veteran workers to revise operating procedures. All workshops held forums with veteran workers, praising their rich technical experience, encouraging them to demonstrate their technical "tricks," and explaining them on the spot, thereby formulating or revising technical operating procedures. Some workshops put up large banners reading "Invite Zhuge Liang out of Wolonggang," to encourage the enthusiasm of veteran workers. Veteran worker Master Chen from the Fifth Workshop proactively exchanged ideas with other veteran workers before the demonstration, studying how to demonstrate and explain, thus making the demonstration very exciting and insightful for the workers. After the demonstration, workers said, "The old master's skills are impressive, he has the solutions," so workshops began to call for veteran masters to take action. In a few days, veteran workers participated in demonstrating their "tricks." The administration organized technicians to conduct research during the veteran workers' demonstrations, collect these "tricks," mobilize the workers to discuss, supplement, and revise them, and finally, after review and approval by the factory management, new operating methods were created. In just seven days, five workshops in the factory had revised their technical operating procedures.

For certain problems that could not be solved by the Kovalev work method, the factory further adopted a prize-winning proposal approach to mobilize employees to put forward rationalization proposals. The administration divided the critical production problems of the factory into 25 topics, and combined with the critical problems proposed by various workshops, a total of 125 topics were assigned to employees for research and resolution. In this rationalization proposal campaign, the leadership also paid special attention to the backbone role of veteran workers. The slogan "Three veteran workers make one Zhuge Liang" resonated throughout the factory. As a result, over 97% of the factory's veteran workers participated in this campaign. They freely formed 105 groups, gathering together to study topics during meals and discussing how to solve problems in the dormitory on Sundays. Veteran worker groups in the Second and Third Workshops were responsible for solving one or two topics each. Among the topics in the Third Workshop, "eliminating reverse processing" was a major challenge, but the group of three veteran workers, Zhou Changtai, and others, after 15 days of painstaking research, finally created a "reverse processing adjuster" to eliminate reverse processing and ensure operational safety. In over two weeks, all employees submitted a total of 187 rationalization proposals, solving 91 topics.

While holding technical demonstrations and prize-winning proposals, the factory also organized a group of technicians to be responsible for several major tasks throughout the factory. For example, a key problem group was formed to cooperate with the technical research groups of technicians and veteran workers in various workshops to be responsible for solving key quality problems; a Kovalev work method promotion group was formed to be responsible for revising technical operating procedures during technical demonstrations, etc.

In the quality inspection campaign, the factory's method of combining the rich technical experience of workers with scientific knowledge educated technicians and workers alike. Technicians said, "These two months are worth two years of university," and new workers said, "These few weeks are as good as several years of apprenticeship," while veteran workers, thanks to the help of technicians, also learned a lot of theoretical knowledge. The enthusiasm of all employees for learning technology has been greatly improved. The factory has now organized 88 regular technical learning organizations, and 85% of young workers have participated in technical learning.

### 东北某工厂质量检查收效很大  减少废品每月可为国家节省六百多吨粮食的财富  只某一项技术改进每月就能节约一亿六千多万元

    东北某工厂质量检查收效很大
    减少废品每月可为国家节省六百多吨粮食的财富
    只某一项技术改进每月就能节约一亿六千多万元
    东北某工厂在质量大检查运动中，由于发动了老工人和技术人员，使揭发出的问题百分之九十一已迅速解决。该厂七月份废品率已较上半年减少百分之四点二二，仅此一项每月就可为国家增产节约等于六百多吨粮食的财富。在技术改进中，只某一项改进，一个月就可以为国家节约一亿六千多万元。
    该厂的质量检查运动，在七月初进入揭发问题阶段。全体职工共提出比较重要的问题二千四百八十六件（缺两个科的统计），经过行政方面分析研究，合并成一千一百四十一条，分别交由各部门负责解决。
    由于产品质量上的毛病大部是技术操作上的缺点所造成，各部门在解决这些问题时，首先采用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，吸收老工人经验修订操作规程。各车间都召开老工人座谈会，表扬他们在技术上的丰富经验，发动他们表演自己技术中的“窍门”，并当场讲解，从而制订或修改技术操作规程。有的车间挂起“请诸葛亮出卧龙岗”的大标语，鼓舞老工人的情绪。第五车间老工人陈师傅在表演之前主动和其他老工人交换意见，研究怎样表演和讲解，因此表演得很精彩，使工人都看得出神。表演后，工人说：“老将一伸手，办法就有”，于是各车间纷纷提出请老将出马的口号。几天里，老工人都参加表演了自己的“窍门”。行政方面组织了技术人员在老工人表演过程中进行研究，把这些“窍门”集中起来，发动工人群众讨论、补充和修正，最后经厂部审核批准，就作成新的操作方法。这样只七天工夫，该厂五个车间都把技术操作规程修订好了。
    对于某些非郭瓦廖夫工作方法所能解决的问题，该厂进一步用课题悬赏办法，发动职工群众提合理化建议。行政方面把全厂生产上的关键问题划分成二十五个课题，连各车间所提出的关键问题一共合成一百二十五个课题，交给职工研究解决。在这一合理化建议运动中，领导方面也特别重视老工人的骨干作用。厂内到处响着“三个老工人合成一个诸葛亮”的口号。所以全厂百分之九十七以上的老工人都参加了这一运动。他们一共自由结合成一百零五个小组，吃饭时凑在一起研究课题，星期天在宿舍里也讨论如何解决问题。第二、第三车间老工人小组，都负责解决一两个课题。第三车间的课题中“消灭倒活”是个大难题，但是周昌泰等三个老工人结合的小组经过十五天的苦心研究，终于创造“倒活调整器”消灭了倒活，还保证了操作时的安全。在两个多星期中，全体职工共提出合理化建议一百八十七件，解决了九十一个课题。
    与举行技术表演和课题悬赏同时，该厂并组织一部分技术人员负责全厂性的几个主要工作。如组成关键问题小组，配合各车间技术人员和老工人的技术研究组，负责解决质量关键问题；组成推广郭瓦廖夫工作方法组，负责在技术表演中修改技术操作规程等。
    该厂在质量检查运动中，把工人的丰富技术经验和科学知识相结合的办法，教育了技术人员，也教育了工人。技术人员表示：“这两个月顶上两年大学”，新工人表示：“这几个星期赶上当几年学徒”，而老工人由于得到技术人员的帮助，也学得了许多理论知识。全体职工学习技术的热情都提高了，现在该厂已组织了八十八个经常的技术学习组织，青年工人有百分之八十五参加了技术学习。
