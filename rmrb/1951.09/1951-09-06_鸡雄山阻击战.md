    Chicken Ridge Blocking Action
    Xu Zhongshao, Xing Zengxian
    The Chicken Ridge blocking action was a glorious battle. The heroes of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, with a small force, carried out blocking and counterattacks for seventeen days and nights, defeating the successive attacks of the 35th Regiment of the US 25th Division and the 29th Regiment of the ROK 9th Division, killing or wounding about a thousand enemy soldiers, and hindering the enemy's northward advance. The Second Company of a certain unit achieved brilliant results in this battle, and the leading organ of the Chinese People's Volunteers specially awarded it the honorary title of "Chicken Ridge Blocking Action Hero Company".
    Chicken Ridge is north of Kimhwa City, about 600 meters high, and at the foot of the mountain is the intersection of several highways. The invading US and ROK bandit troops launched continuous fierce attacks with superior forces coordinated by land and air, starting from June 10th. The first to attack was the 35th Regiment of the US 25th Division. The strength used by the regiment increased from a platoon to a company, and then to a battalion, and attacked continuously for six days, but our army's position remained unshaken. On June 16, the enemy dispatched eight aircraft, eight tanks, and ten howitzers, and launched a fierce attack in coordination with infantry. Four volunteer heroes, led by Zhang Shengkun, a model Communist Party member and leader of the third combat team of the eighth squad, defended the forward positions and bravely repelled three attacks by the enemy's vanguard. During the enemy's fourth attack with two platoons of troops, Zhang Shengkun used clever ambushes in cooperation with comrades from two other squads to kill or wound more than 30 enemy soldiers. On another position, the heroes of a squad destroyed two enemy tanks and killed or wounded more than 30 enemies. Although the enemy's artillery fire was very fierce that day, not a single enemy infantryman was able to climb the mountain. After ten days of fierce fighting, our army inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, with 102 clearly visible to the soldiers alone. Seeing that things were not going well, the American devils drove the ROK puppet army to the front lines to act as cannon fodder, while they retreated behind to hold the line. The ROK puppet army launched attacks with entire companies, entire battalions, and even entire regiments, while the US artillery fired volleys in support. The fate of these puppet soldiers was even more tragic than that of their masters, with hundreds of corpses lying in front of our forward positions, but they still had not opened a path to the summit of Chicken Ridge.
    Sometimes, after the enemy seized a position of our army with superior forces, the heroes would recapture it with a sudden counterattack. The daylight counterattack of the Third Platoon, which earned a collective first-class merit, is one example.
    One day, the puppet 9th Division used two battalions to attack the 507 Heights in the east of Chicken Ridge. After inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, the defending troops retreated. Immediately afterwards, the Third Platoon took advantage of the enemy's unsteady footing and immediately counterattacked. Political Instructor Wei Qingxian led 36 heroes, advancing through the grass and woods. They skillfully avoided the shells beside them and the enemy planes overhead, and went straight to the bottom of the 507 Heights, divided into two groups and pounced up. The enemy was lying on the top of the mountain resting, never dreaming that we would counterattack so quickly. When they realized that things were not going well, the grenades of the assault heroes had already exploded over their heads, and the submachine guns of the soldiers had already pointed at their chests. After the heroes captured the first hilltop, they immediately rushed to the second hilltop. The enemy was utterly defeated by this sudden attack, scattered and fled, some were taken prisoners, and in just twenty minutes, the volunteer heroes recaptured the 507 Heights and crushed an entire enemy battalion.
    The Second Company, which was awarded the honorary title of "Chicken Ridge Blocking Action Hero Company", demonstrated tenacious independent combat spirit after being divided and surrounded by superior enemy forces. It shattered the enemy's division and encirclement with brave counterattacks and killed and wounded a large number of enemies. All the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers held a grand celebration meeting on August 12 to congratulate the heroic company and heroes who had made meritorious contributions in the battle.

    鸡雄山阻击战
    徐中绍  邢增宪
    鸡雄山的阻击战是一次光辉的战斗。志愿军某部的勇士们在十七昼夜间，以少数兵力进行阻击与反击，击溃了美军第二十五师第三十五团与李伪军第九师第二十九联队的轮番进攻，杀伤敌军约千人，阻滞了敌人的北犯。某部第二连在这次战斗中战绩辉煌，志愿军领导机关特授予“鸡雄山阻击战斗英雄连”的光荣称号。
    鸡雄山在金化城北，高约六百公尺，山下是几条公路的交叉点。北犯的美李匪军从六月十日起，以陆、空配合的优势兵力发起连续猛攻。首先进攻的是美军第二十五师第三十五团。该团使用的兵力从一个排增加到一个连，又增加到一个营，连续攻了六天，我军阵地屹然未动。六月十六日敌人出动八架飞机、八辆坦克和十门榴弹炮，配合步兵发起猛烈的进攻。据守在前沿阵地上，以模范共产党员第八班第三战斗小组长张胜坤为首的四位志愿军勇士，奋勇打退敌人先头兵力的三次进攻。在敌人以两个排的兵力发起第四次攻击时，张胜坤用巧妙的伏击配合另两个小组的战友杀伤敌人三十多名。在另一阵地上的一个班的勇士，炸毁了敌坦克二辆，并杀伤了三十多个敌人。这一天敌人的炮火虽然十分猛烈，但是敌人的步兵没有一个能够爬上山。经过了十天的激烈战斗，我军大量地杀伤了敌人，仅战士们看得清楚的就有一百零两个。美国鬼子见事不妙，就驱使李伪军来挡头阵，自己退到后面压阵去了。李伪军以整连整营直到整团的兵力发起进攻，美军的大炮发射着排炮助战。这些奴才兵的命运比他们的主子更为悲惨，在我前沿阵地前的尸首摆了好几百个，可是还没有打开冲上鸡雄山山顶的道路。
    有时敌人以优势兵力夺去了我军一处阵地后，勇士们又以突然的反击把它夺回来。荣立集体一等功的第三排的白昼反击战就是一个例子。
    有一天，伪九师用两个营兵力强攻鸡雄山东部五零七高地，守备部队给敌人以大量杀伤后撤退下来。紧接着，第三排趁着敌人还未站稳脚，马上就反击上去。政治指导员魏庆先率领三十六个勇士，在草丛树林中前进。他们巧妙地躲避过身旁的炮弹与头上敌机的侦察，直奔到五零七高地下面，分成两路猛扑上去。敌人正在山顶上躺着休息，做梦也没想到我们反击得这样快。当他们发觉不妙的时候，突击勇士们的手榴弹已经在他们头上炸开，战士们的冲锋枪也已经指到他们的胸口上。勇士们夺下了第一座山头后，立刻乘胜奔向第二座山头。敌人被这一突然攻击打得落花流水，四散奔逃，有的当了俘虏，仅仅二十分钟，志愿军勇士们就夺回了五零七高地，并打垮了敌人一个整营。
    荣膺“鸡雄山阻击战斗英雄连”光荣称号的第二连，在被优势敌人分割包围后，各排、班、小组都表现了顽强的独立作战精神，以勇猛的反击粉碎敌人的分割包围，杀伤了大量敌人。志愿军某部全体指战员曾于八月十二日举行隆重的庆功大会，为战斗中有功的英雄连队与功臣们贺功。
