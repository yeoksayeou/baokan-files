    “Breach in the City Wall (Between City and Countryside)” – Seen at Dongcheng Root
    (Sketches of the Capital, No. 13)
    By Shao Yu
    The ancient city wall,
    How many years have you separated the city and the countryside!
    Entering the city, leaving the city, it’s practically passing a checkpoint!
    Who knows when the city gate will be closed,
    Then, the city will lack grain and vegetables,
    And the countryside won’t even have a place to buy sickles!
    The rulers are creating poverty and disaster,
    And are afraid that workers and farmers will join hands,
    They feel that the city walls are still too short and there are too many gates.
    ×    ×    ×
    Now,
    People walking,
    Just feel that the high city wall is not as good as a flat road!
    There is so much interaction between the city and the countryside,
    The city gates are not enough!
    From east to west,
    From south to north,
    How many breaches have been opened in the city walls!
    Outside the breaches is a countryside that has been turned upside down.
    Agricultural products are transported in from there,
    And industrial products are transported out from here.
    What a picture full of sunshine and bright prospects for life!

    “城豁口（城乡之间）”——东城根所见
    （首都速写之十三）
    邵宇作
    古老的城墙，
    你把城市和乡村隔开多少年！
    进城，出城，简直是过关哪！
    说不定什么时候城门一关，
    那么，城里就缺粮食、没青菜，
    乡下连镰刀也没处买了！
    统治者在制造贫困和灾难，
    又怕工人、农民拉起手来，
    他们觉得城墙还太矮，门也太多了。
    ×    ×    ×
    现在哪，
    走路的人，
    就觉得高城不如平路好！
    城乡的交往多，
    城门不够用了！
    从东到西，
    从南到北，
    打开多少个城墙的豁口啊！
    豁口外面是一片翻身了的农村。
    农产品从那运进来，
    工业品又从这运出去。
    这是一幅多么充满着阳光和生活远景的图画！
