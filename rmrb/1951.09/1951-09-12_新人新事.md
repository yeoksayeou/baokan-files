    Yao Shutang, District Chief of Guanlibao District, Shenyang, Bravely Fights Floods and Protects Dikes with His Body
    Editor:
    In mid-August, continuous rain fell in the suburbs of Shenyang City, and the water level of the Hun River rose sharply, soon overflowing the dikes everywhere. Yao Shutang, the district chief of Guanlibao District in Shenyang City, personally inspected the dikes in the rain and guided the flood control work. One evening, District Chief Yao and several other comrades were returning from inspecting the dikes in Xinkaihe Village when they heard the sound of water gurgling at the bottom of the dike between Jianshetun and Zhangdangbao Village. He held up a lantern and looked down, discovering a large opening in the bottom of the dike caused by the water. If this opening was not blocked in time, there would be a risk of the dike collapsing. At that time, District Chief Yao, on the one hand, called for people to come and repair it, and on the other hand, he did not hesitate to jump down the riverbank and use his body to block the water opening. Then, two other comrades also jumped down. When the repair team arrived, District Chief Yao and the other two were already trapped in the mud and water, becoming mud men. This incident moved all the people who came to repair the dikes. They rushed to get District Chief Yao out first and then began to repair the dikes nervously. Before long, the water opening was blocked. District Chief Yao's responsible work attitude and heroic dike-protecting spirit are truly worthy of learning.

    Wang Shunyi, "Model of Rescue" of a Certain Unit of the Volunteer Army
    Comrade Wang Shunyi, a medical orderly of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, rescued the wounded day and night during the second phase of the Fifth Battle, and became ill due to overwork and suppuration of his foot after being pierced. The higher-ups told him to go to the sickbay to recuperate. During his recuperation, he still actively worked, enduring his own pain to take care of other sick and wounded soldiers, and came up with many ways to solve the difficulty of lacking medical supplies. After the end of the Fifth Battle, the unit was ordered to transfer. When passing over a bridge in a certain area, in order to safely pass through the enemy's artillery blockade line, the troops advanced in a dispersed manner. When Comrade Wang Shunyi was crossing the bridge, he saw several wounded soldiers lying under the bridge, so he disregarded the enemy's artillery fire and his own pain, and bravely went down the bridge to rescue them. He continuously carried eleven wounded soldiers out of the danger zone, and skillfully retreated to the side of the road, applying medicine and bandaging the wounded. Wang Shunyi himself was even more ill due to excessive hunger and fatigue. But he did not consider these, and still insisted on taking in the wounded along the way. Later, he led nine wounded soldiers to find the unit, one of whom was seriously injured and could not walk. Wang Shunyi carried him for twenty-six miles and finally reached the destination. Comrade Wang Shunyi is not afraid of hardship, actively finds ways to overcome difficulties, rescues the sick and wounded, promotes a high degree of class love, and demonstrates the excellent qualities of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The higher-ups specially awarded him the honorary title of "Model of Rescue".

    Model Family of a Volunteer Army Soldier
    Xu Lamei (Youth League member) is a labor model in Yaoshanggou Village, Wuxiang, Shanxi. She is twenty-two years old this year. Her husband, Han Jianghe, is a labor model in the same village. This spring, Han Jianghe joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Xu Lamei went to the army to visit her husband. They reunited for four days, and the troops were preparing to move. On the one hand, Xu Lamei encouraged her husband to study hard, fight bravely, and complete the glorious task of defending the country and protecting the home; on the other hand, she took the lead in calling on the family members of the Volunteer Army in the troops to actively participate in production and support the front lines when they returned home. The unit immediately notified the village government of Yaoshanggou Village of Xu Lamei's exemplary action of this high degree of patriotism, and the honorary title of "Model Volunteer Army Family Member Xu Lamei" immediately spread. Xu Lamei is the deputy leader of the production mutual aid group in the village. She leads many women to participate in labor, carefully and responsibly helping everyone learn agricultural techniques such as hoeing and seeding. Before the spring plowing this year, they found that the amount of fertilizer was less than the originally planned number of loads. She led many women to sweep sheep manure on the hillside every afternoon, exceeding the plan. When she returns home, she not only takes care of housework but also motivates her parents-in-law to make progress together. Under her enthusiastic promotion and encouragement, her mother-in-law was elected as the village's sanitation model, and her father-in-law was also elected as a labor model in coal mining production. The whole family is full of harmony and hard work.

    八月中旬，沈阳市郊阴雨连绵，浑河水位骤涨，很快就普遍漫堤。沈阳市官立堡区区长姚树棠，亲自冒雨检查河堤，指导防汛工作。一天晚上，姚区长和另外几个同志从新开河村检查河堤归来，行至建设屯与张当堡村中间时，听到堤底处有水潺潺作响。他提灯下望，发现堤底被水冲开一个大口子。这个口子如不及时堵住，将有破堤的危险。当时姚区长一面招呼人前来抢修，一面自己毫不犹豫地跳下河堤，用身体堵在水口上。接着，另外两个同志也跟着跳了下去。当抢修队赶来时，姚区长等三人已被陷在泥水里，变成了泥人。这件事感动了全体来抢修河堤的人们。他们抢先换出姚区长后，就紧张地抢修起来。不长时间，水口就被堵上了。姚区长这种工作负责，英勇护堤的精神，实在值得学习。

    志愿军某部“救护模范”王顺义
    志愿军某部卫生员王顺义同志，在五次战役第二阶段中，不分昼夜地抢救伤员，劳累过度，加上脚被刺破化脓而得了病。上级叫他到病号队里去休养。他在休养期间仍积极工作，忍受着自己的痛苦，来护理其他伤病员，并想出很多办法解决医药用品缺乏的困难。五次战役结束后，该部奉命转移。在经过某地大桥时，为了安全通过敌人炮火封锁线，部队就分散前进。王顺义同志在过桥时，看见桥下躺着几个伤员，便不顾敌人的炮火和自己的痛苦，奋勇下桥抢救。他连续把十一个伤员背出危险区，并机动地撤至公路旁边，给伤员敷药、包扎。王顺义自己因过度饥饿和疲劳，病更加重了。但他毫不考虑这些，在途中仍坚持收容伤员。后来，他领着九名伤员找部队，其中有一个重伤员不能走，王顺义背着他走了二十六里路，终于到达目的地。王顺义同志不怕艰苦，积极想办法克服困难，救护伤病员，发扬了高度的阶级友爱精神，表现了中国人民志愿军的优秀品质。上级特授以“救护模范”的光荣称号。
