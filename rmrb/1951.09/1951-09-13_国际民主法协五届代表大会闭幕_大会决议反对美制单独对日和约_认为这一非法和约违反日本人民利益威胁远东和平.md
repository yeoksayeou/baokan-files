Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th: The Fifth Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, which opened in Berlin on the 5th, closed on the 9th. After heated discussions, the Congress adopted resolutions on the reports of the two agenda items: "The International Association of Democratic Lawyers Fights for Peace" and "The International Association of Democratic Lawyers Fights to Defend Human and Civil Rights and Against the Revival of Fascism."

The resolution adopted by the Congress on the report of the first agenda item stated: The International Association of Democratic Lawyers firmly opposes the peace treaty imposed on the Japanese people by U.S. imperialism, believing that this treaty violates the interests of the Japanese people and is a threat to the security of the people of the Far East and Asian countries. The resolution also supports the just demands of the people of all countries to immediately cease foreign military intervention in Korea, peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and punish war criminals; it demands the prohibition of atomic, bacterial, chemical, and radioactive weapons, and all other weapons of mass destruction, and declares the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal. The resolution concludes by expressing support for the proposal of the major powers to reduce all armaments by one-third, and demands that aggressive war be recognized as the most serious international crime. The Congress also endorsed the definition of "aggression" from the Second World Peace Congress, namely "the heinous act of a country using its armed forces first against another country, regardless of pretext, is aggression."

The resolution adopted by the Congress on the report of the second agenda item stated: The International Association of Democratic Lawyers calls on democratic legal workers around the world to expose the fascist nature of the administrative, legislative, and judicial systems implemented in the United States and other capitalist countries, and to expose these systems as being used against forces for peace and democracy and to aid war preparations. The resolution calls for intensified struggle against fascist laws and the reactionary offensive against the democratic freedom rights of the working people.

The Congress also passed a resolution in support of the persecuted in colonial, semi-colonial, and dependent countries, and a resolution calling on democratic legal workers around the world to sign the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers.

The Congress re-elected the leadership, with Pritt re-elected as President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and Nordmann re-elected as Secretary-General.
