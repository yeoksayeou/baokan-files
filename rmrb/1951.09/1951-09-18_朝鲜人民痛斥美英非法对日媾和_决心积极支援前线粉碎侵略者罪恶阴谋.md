Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 17th: Pyongyang newspapers have been publishing statements and talks by people from all walks of life in Korea for several days, unanimously denouncing the illegality of the US-UK separate peace with Japan. Kim Chang-jun, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland Front, said on the 14th: The US-UK separate peace with Japan has once again exposed the war policy of the American aggressors to the people of the world. This treaty has aroused the indignation of the people all over the world who oppose war and yearn for peace, and first of all the indignation of the Japanese people, because the Japanese people are demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty. The Korean people firmly oppose the so-called peace treaty with Japan illegally signed in San Francisco, and the reason for this is very clear. The revival of Japanese militarism is obviously a great threat to peace in the Far East. The San Francisco conference actually excluded the Chinese people, who had carried out armed struggle to resist Japanese aggression, and countries such as India and Burma, which had the most direct interest in the peace with Japan, did not participate. This shows that the US-UK peace treaty has no legitimacy, but is merely a unilateral treaty. The Korean people, who clearly understand the aggressive nature of the US-UK peace treaty with Japan, unanimously declare that the US-UK peace treaty is invalid.

Railway worker Zhao Chunwu said: It is not difficult to imagine what kind of results this treaty will lead to. We Korean workers lived under the swords and guns of Japanese militarism for half a century and can never allow Japanese militarism to revive. We warmly support the legitimate proposal made by the Soviet representative to ban Japanese rearmament to ensure peace, and resolutely oppose the US-UK imperialists' concocted "peace treaty" with Japan.

Clerk Kim Song-eung said: The mention of Japanese imperialism fills me with hatred. Our generation has suffered the trampling and ravages of the Japanese invaders, and we must never let our next generation suffer the same pain. I must transform my infinite hatred for the US-UK aggressive bandits into strength, and together with my compatriots across the country, use practical actions to smash the aggressors' heinous conspiracy.

Youth Li Qixun said: The Chinese people, who waged a long-term war of resistance against Japan and made the greatest sacrifices, were excluded from the conference, and the great Soviet Union did not sign the treaty. This ugly farce of a separate peace with Japan is of course illegal. We Korean youth are determined to actively carry out the work of supporting the front lines, smash the schemes of the US-UK aggressors, and strengthen the forces defending peace.

    朝鲜人民痛斥美英非法对日媾和
    决心积极支援前线粉碎侵略者罪恶阴谋
    【新华社平壤十七日电】平壤各报连日刊载朝鲜各界人民的声明和谈话，一致痛斥美英单独对日媾和的非法。朝鲜祖国战线中央书记局长金昌俊十四日发表谈话说：美英单独对日媾和这件事，再一次向全世界人民暴露了美国侵略者的战争政策。这一条约引起了反对战争、渴望和平的全世界人民的激愤，首先引起了日本人民大众的激愤，因为日本人民是要求缔结全面和约的。朝鲜人民坚决反对在旧金山非法签订的所谓对日和约，其理由是很清楚的。日本军国主义的复活，显然是对远东和平的很大威胁。旧金山会议竟将曾为反抗日本侵略而进行武装斗争的中国人民排斥在外，而与对日媾和最有切身利害关系的印度、缅甸等国也没有参加，这就说明美英对日和约没有任何合法性，而只是片面的条约。清楚地了解美英对日和约的侵略本质的朝鲜人民，一致宣告美英对日和约是无效的。
    铁路工人赵春五说：这种条约将引起什么样的结果，是不难想像的。我们朝鲜工人曾在半个世纪中生活在日本军国主义的枪刀下，绝不能容许日本军国主义复活。我们热烈支持苏联代表所提的禁止日本重新武装以保障和平的正当建议，坚决反对美英帝国主义者所包办的对日“和约”。
    职员金松应说：一提起日本帝国主义，我就禁不住切齿痛恨。我们这一代曾饱受日寇的践踏和蹂躏，绝不能让我们的下一代再受同样的痛苦。我一定要把我对美英侵略强盗的无限憎恨化为力量，和全国同胞一起，用实际行动来粉碎侵略者的罪恶阴谋。
    青年李七勋说：长期进行过抗日战争而且牺牲最大的中国人民竟被排斥在会议以外，伟大的苏联也没有在条约上签字，这种单独对日媾和的丑剧当然是非法的，我们朝鲜青年决心积极进行支援前线的工作，粉碎美英侵略者的诡计，加强保卫和平的力量。
