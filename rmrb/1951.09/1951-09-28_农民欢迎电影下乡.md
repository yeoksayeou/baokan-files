    Farmers Welcome Movies to the Countryside
    To the Editor:
    This time, I went to the old liberated areas in the countryside with the film team of the Central Delegation to show movies. Everywhere we went, farmers from sixty, seventy, or even a hundred *li* away came to watch. Some old men and women who could not walk had people carry them to see the films. Each show had thousands of viewers, and at most there were more than 20,000 people. In the ten counties of the Lüliang District alone, there were more than 250,000 viewers. Many farmers had never seen a movie before, and they were really happy to see sound movies this time. Some old people said, "Chairman Mao sent people to show sound movies, which has broadened our horizons." The farmers were even happier to see Chairman Mao on the screen. The films we brought this time, "Heroes of Lüliang" and "Happy Farmers," both depict the lives and struggles of farmers, and are most welcomed by the farmers. Some newsreels, showing how workers produce and how they carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, are also welcomed by the farmers. From this, it can be seen how much the farmers need movies to be shown in the countryside! We should make our best efforts to organize film projection teams to go to the countryside to show movies regularly.

### 农民欢迎电影下乡

    农民欢迎电影下乡编辑同志：
    我这次随中央访问团的电影队到老解放区农村放映电影。每到一处，六、七十里甚至百里以外的农民，都跑来看。有些走不动路的老头、老太太，叫人背着来看。每场观众都是几千人，最多的时候竟有二万多人。单是吕梁区十个县的观众，就有二十五万多人。许多农民从来没见过电影，这次看到了有声电影，真是高兴。有些老人说：“毛主席派人来放有声电影，给我们长见识来了。”农民们在银幕上看见了毛主席，更是高兴。我们这次带去的“吕梁英雄传”、“农家乐”，都是表现农民生活与斗争的影片，农民最是欢迎。有些新闻片，表现工人怎样生产和怎样进行抗美援朝运动，也受到农民的欢迎。由此看来，农民是多么需要电影下乡啊！我们应该尽最大的努力，组织电影放映队经常到农村去放映。
