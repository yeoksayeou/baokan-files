    Our Great Motherland
    Today is the 20th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. On this day in 1931, the Japanese invaders launched an armed attack in Northeast China. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek adopted a policy of non-resistance and offered the Northeast to the Japanese bandits. Patriotic people in the Northeast, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, established the Anti-Japanese United Army and persisted in the war of resistance. This is a scene of the Anti-Japanese United Army marching in the ice and snow. (Oil painting by Yang Jiao)

    我们伟大的祖国
    今天是“九一八”二十周年。一九三一年的这一天，日本侵略者在我国东北，发动武装进攻。卖国贼蒋介石采取不抵抗主义，把东北奉送给日寇。东北爱国志士，在中国共产党的领导下建立了抗日联军，坚持抗战。这是抗日联军在冰天雪地中进军的情形。（油画，杨角作）
