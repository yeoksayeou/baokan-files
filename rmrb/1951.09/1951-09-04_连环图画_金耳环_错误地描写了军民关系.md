    Comic Strip "Golden Earrings" Erroneously Depicts Army-People Relations
    To the Editor:
    I recently saw the comic strip "Golden Earrings" (original author Wei Ming, compiled and drawn by Qian Yu Fan), first published in October 1950 by Shanghai Huaming Bookstore, and I think it has a major error. In order to portray the People's Liberation Army's excellent discipline and army-people relations, the author erroneously depicts a PLA squad stationed in Beiwang Village near Bengbu, living in the home of a Landlord surnamed Lin, and sweeping the latrine, cleaning the pigsty, and moving boxes for the landlord's family to win the landlord's "love." I believe the author has distorted the PLA's position and misunderstood army discipline and army-people relations. Because landlords are our class enemies, not part of the people, there is no question of army-people relations between us and the landlords. The People's Liberation Army is an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought and with a high degree of class consciousness, certainly not a team without a class position as depicted by the author. Therefore, this is a very bad comic strip.

### 连环图画“金耳环”错误地描写了军民关系

    连环图画“金耳环”错误地描写了军民关系
    编辑同志：
    最近看到上海华明书店一九五○年十月初版的连环图画“金耳环”（原著者微明、编绘者钱予凡），我觉得是有很大的错误的。作者为了描写人民解放军的优良纪律和军民关系，竟错误地描绘了人民解放军某班战士驻在蚌埠附近北王庄的时候，住在林姓大地主家中，并替地主家打扫茅房、清洁猪圈、搬箱笼等去争取地主家的“爱戴”。我认为作者是歪曲了解放军的立场，错误地理解了军队纪律和军民关系。因为地主是我们的阶级敌人，并不是人民中的一部分，我们和地主之间谈不上什么军民关系。解放军是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的、有高度阶级觉悟的军队，绝不是作者所描写的那样没有阶级立场的队伍。因此这是一本很坏的连环图画。
