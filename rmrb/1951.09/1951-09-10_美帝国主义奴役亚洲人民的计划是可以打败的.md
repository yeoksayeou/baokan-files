    The San Francisco Conference, manipulated single-handedly by American imperialism with the aim of enslaving the Asian people, has come to a hasty close on September 8th. The conference itself and the "Treaty of Peace" with Japan "passed" by the 48 countries, including the United States and Britain, are equally absurd.
    The San Francisco Conference cannot be called a peace conference with Japan in three senses. First, major Asian countries, first and foremost China, which fought against Japan for the longest time and resisted the most Japanese invading forces, and India, the Asian power second only to China in population, did not participate in the conference. On the contrary, the vast majority of the countries participating in the conference had never fought Japan at all and were not Asian countries. Second, the conference was not a conference at all. No discussion was allowed at the conference. Apart from the just statements made by the representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia at the meeting, the so-called conference was in fact just a small group of signatories obeying the United States government unconditionally signing American documents. Third, as we have repeatedly pointed out in the past, the so-called treaty prepared by the United States is not a treaty of peace at all, but a treaty preparing for a new war. It is not the independence of Japan, but the continuation of the state of enslavement of Japan; it is not the demilitarization of Japan, but the revival of Japanese militarist forces under American control; it is not the guarantee of the security of the Asian countries that have been subjected to Japanese aggression, but the threat to the security of these countries.
    Gromyko, the head of the Soviet delegation, thoroughly exposed the essence of this illegal conference in his speech at the San Francisco Conference on September 5. Gromyko justly pointed out that the People's Republic of China must participate in the peace conference with Japan, and that the peace treaty with Japan must stipulate China's sovereignty over Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and the Nansha Islands. Gromyko, on behalf of the Soviet government, put forward thirteen proposals to amend the draft of the US-British peace treaty with Japan. These proposals include fair claims on the issues of the territory of the People's Republic of China, the territory of the Soviet Union , the territory of Japan, the foreign troops stationed in Japan, Japanese reparations, the approval procedures for the peace treaty with Japan, the democratization of Japan, the demilitarization of Japan, and the development of Japanese peaceful industry. The Soviet proposals were of course not discussed and passed by the San Francisco Conference, but the people of China, Japan, Asia, and the world can recognize that only the Soviet Union is the true leader in defending peace in the East and the world. In contrast to the Soviet Union, the US government's heinous acts of trying to enslave the Asian people and endanger world peace at the San Francisco Conference show that it is exactly the same as the Japanese imperialists six years ago, and is the mortal enemy of all the Chinese people, the mortal enemy of all the Asian people, and the mortal enemy of all the people in the world.
    But people should not only see the ferocious appearance of American imperialism, but also see its essence of heading for collapse. The American imperialist plan to conquer Asia and enslave the Asian people is dangerous, but also fragile. This is because:
    First, American imperialism has completely ignored the lessons of the defeat of Japanese imperialism. It has forgotten that even at that time, when the entire Asian continent, except for the Asian part of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the small people's liberation areas in China, was still in darkness, the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries invaded by Japan united together and, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, still defeated Japanese imperialism and shattered the Japanese imperialist's mad plan to conquer China and Asia. The defeat of Japanese imperialism proves a truth: as long as we Asian people bravely rise up to resist under correct leadership and obtain the assistance of the Soviet Union and the working classes of capitalist countries, any ferocious imperialism can be completely defeated. The reason why American imperialism is bound to be unlucky is that it has not and cannot recognize this truth.
    Second, American imperialism has completely disregarded the extremely huge changes in the world and Asian situation after the defeat of Japan. Only the blind and the mad would not see that today's world and today's Asia are completely different from the world and Asia before Japan's surrender, and that the face of the world and Asia has changed greatly. Just as Hitler's defeat in Europe marked a new era in Europe, the defeat of Japanese imperialism marked a new era in Asia. Inspired by the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the people of Asian countries have rapidly awakened and united. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the birth of the People's Republic of China, the birth of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and their victorious struggles, mark the fundamental transformation of Asia's historical destiny. In addition, the struggles of the people in the Philippines, Malaya, Indonesia, Burma, India and other places against imperialism have also made great progress, and the people in Iran and other countries in West Asia are also carrying out struggles against imperialism. This is the picture of Asia today, which has changed and continues to change. The reason why American imperialism is bound to be unlucky is that it has not and cannot recognize this huge change in the Asian situation, and that it has not and cannot recognize the irresistible force of the Asian people in striving for independence and liberation.
    Third, American imperialism has not only completely ignored the lessons of the defeat of Japanese imperialism, but also completely ignored the lessons of its own failure to implement its aggressive plan to enslave the Asian people after Japan's surrender. The history of the development of the Asian situation in the six years since Japan's surrender is a history of the bankruptcy of the American plan to invade Asia. But the U.S. government has not learned any lessons from the six years of historical records. Although its plan of aggression against China has completely gone bankrupt, it is still invading Korea and occupying Taiwan, attempting to make a comeback to invade China. Then, its plan to conquer Korea and further attack China was also declared bankrupt by the counterattack of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, but to this day, it is still doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage the Kaesong armistice negotiations desired by the people of the world, it is still insisting on a separate peace with Japan, rearming Japan, and still insisting on invading Asia. But today, the people of all Asia have increasingly clearly realized that imperialism is a plague in Asia, and the people of all Asia are no longer willing to suffer the disasters caused by this plague of imperialism.
    Fourth, American imperialism not only ignored the tremendous changes in the Asian situation after the failure of the Japanese invading forces, but also completely ignored the tremendous changes in the domestic situation in Japan after the failure of the Japanese invading forces. The United States' brazenly convening a peace conference with Japan that excludes the People's Republic of China, and implementing a separate peace treaty with Japan opposed by China, the Soviet Union, India, Burma, and the new democratic countries (whose total population accounts for the majority of Asia and the world), cannot cause any actual changes in the situation in Japan, but only legitimizes its actions of arming Japan and enslaving Japan. Therefore, this can never solve any problems in Japan, nor can it bring any benefits to Japan. Wars of aggression have brought disaster to the people of Japan, and the outcome of the war for the Japanese people is actually equivalent to the loss of their country. Japan has in fact become a colony of the United States. May I ask: Under such circumstances, no matter how insane, treacherous and sycophantic the Japanese reactionaries are, will the Japanese people still believe that serving as cannon fodder for American imperialism to launch a war of aggression against their Asian brothers will bring them any benefits?
    It is very clear that Asian affairs should be managed by the Asian people themselves, and imperialism must not be allowed to manage them. The American government, which only represents a small handful of multi-millionaires like Morgan, Rockefeller, DuPont, and Mellon, wants to cross the Pacific Ocean for ten thousand kilometers to dominate and enslave more than half of the world's population in Asia. This is a madman's plan, which is completely unreasonable no matter how you say it, and it is completely unworkable no matter how you say it.
    The people of all China and all Asia unite to defeat the American imperialist plan to enslave the Asian people!

### 美帝国主义奴役亚洲人民的计划是可以打败的

    美帝国主义奴役亚洲人民的计划是可以打败的
    美帝国主义一手操纵的以奴役亚洲人民为目的的旧金山会议，已经在九月八日匆匆收场了。这个会议本身以及它所“通过”的美英等四十八个国家的对日“和约”，同样是荒谬绝伦的。
    旧金山会议在三个意义上完全不能称为什么对日和会。第一，主要的亚洲国家，首先是对日作战最久和抗击日本侵略军最多的中国，以及人口仅次于中国的亚洲大国印度，没有参加这个会议。相反，参加这个会议的绝大多数国家，根本没有和日本作战过，也不是亚洲国家。第二，这个会议根本不是什么会议。会议上不允许任何讨论。除了苏联、波兰、捷克三国的代表在会上作了正义的声明以外，这个所谓会议事实上只是一小群听命于美国政府的签名人在美国的文件上无条件签名罢了。第三，如我们过去所已经一再指明的，美国准备的所谓和约，完全不是什么和约，而只是准备新战争的条约。不是日本的独立，而是日本的奴役状态的继续；不是日本的非军国主义化，而是日本军国主义势力在美国控制之下的复活；不是受过日本侵略的亚洲国家的安全的保障，而是这些国家的安全的威胁。
    苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯九月五日在旧金山会议上的演说，透彻地揭露了这一非法会议的本质。葛罗米柯公正地指出对日和会必须有中华人民共和国参加，指出对日和约必须规定中国在台湾、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛、南威岛的主权。葛罗米柯代表苏联政府提出了修改美英对日和约草案的十三项建议。这些建议包括关于中华人民共和国的领土、苏联的领土、日本的领土、外国在日本的驻军、日本的赔偿、对日和约的批准手续、日本的民主化、日本的非军国主义化、日本和平工业的发展等问题的公正的主张。苏联的建议当然不能被旧金山会议所讨论和通过，但是中国、日本、亚洲和世界各国的人民，由此可以认识，只有苏联才是保卫东方和世界和平的真正领袖。和苏联相反，美国政府在旧金山会议中的力图奴役亚洲人民、危害世界和平的罪恶行为，说明它和六年以前的日本帝国主义一模一样，是全中国人民的死敌，是全亚洲人民的死敌，也是全世界人民的死敌。
    可是人们不应该只是看到美帝国主义穷凶极恶的外表，而看不到它的走向崩溃的实质。美帝国主义征服亚洲、奴役亚洲人民的计划是危险的，但也是脆弱的。这是因为：
    第一，美国帝国主义完全没有注意到日本帝国主义败亡的教训。它忘记了就是在那时，在整个亚洲大陆，除了苏联亚洲部分、蒙古人民共和国和中国的狭小的人民解放区以外，还是一片黑暗的时候，中国人民和亚洲其他被日本侵略国家的人民团结起来，在苏联的援助之下，仍然打败了日本帝国主义，粉碎了日本帝国主义征服中国和亚洲的疯狂计划。日本帝国主义的败亡证明一个真理，这就是：只要我们亚洲人民在正确的领导下勇敢地起来反抗，并取得苏联及资本主义各国工人阶级的援助，任何凶恶的帝国主义都是完全可以打败的。美帝国主义所以一定要倒霉，就是因为它没有而且不可能认识这个真理。
    第二，美帝国主义完全无视了日本败亡后世界和亚洲情势的极端巨大的变化。只有瞎子和疯子才会看不见：今天的世界和今天的亚洲，已经完全不是日本投降以前的世界和亚洲了，世界和亚洲的面貌已经大大改变了。和希特勒在欧洲的失败标志了欧洲的新时代一样，日本帝国主义的失败标志了亚洲的新时代。受了以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的鼓舞，亚洲各国人民已经迅速地觉悟起来和团结起来。中国人民解放战争的胜利和中华人民共和国的诞生，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的诞生和胜利的斗争，标志着亚洲历史命运的根本转变。除此以外，菲律宾、马来亚、印尼、缅甸、印度等地人民反对帝国主义的斗争也有了很大的发展，亚洲西部的伊朗和其他国家的人民也正在进行反对帝国主义的斗争。这就是变化了和继续变化着的亚洲今天的图景。美国帝国主义所以一定要倒霉，就是因为它没有而且不可能认识亚洲局势的这个巨大变化，就因为它没有而且不可能认识亚洲人民争取独立和解放的不可抗拒的力量。
    第三，美帝国主义不仅完全忽视了日本帝国主义败亡的教训，而且也完全忽视了它自己在日本投降后推行奴役亚洲人民的侵略计划的失败教训。日本投降后六年以来亚洲形势的发展史，就是一部美国侵略亚洲计划的破产史。但是美国政府并没有从六年的历史纪录中取得任何教训。尽管它在中国的侵略计划已经完全破产，它仍然侵略朝鲜、霸占台湾，企图卷土重来侵略中国。接着，它的征服朝鲜并进一步进攻中国的计划也在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的反攻之下宣告破产了，但是直到今天，它仍然千方百计地阻挠和破坏为全世界人民所属望的开城停战谈判，它仍然坚持单独对日媾和、重新武装日本，仍然坚持侵略亚洲。但是在今天，全亚洲人民都已经日益清楚地认识，帝国主义在亚洲就是一种瘟疫，全亚洲人民都再也不愿意遭受帝国主义这种瘟疫所加给自己的灾祸了。
    第四，美国帝国主义不但无视了日本侵略势力失败后亚洲情势的巨大变化，而且也完全无视了日本侵略势力失败后日本国内情势的巨大变化。美国的悍然召开排除中华人民共和国在外的对日和会，和实行签订为中国、苏联、印度、缅甸和各新民主国家（这些国家的总人口占了亚洲和世界的大多数）所反对的单独对日和约，并不能造成日本情况的任何实际变化，而不过是把它武装日本和奴役日本的行为合法化罢了。因此，这决不能解决日本的任何问题，也决不能给日本带来任何好处。侵略战争曾经给日本的人民带来了灾难，战争的结局对于日本人民来说实际上等于亡了国，日本已经在实际上变成了美国的殖民地。试问：在这种情况下，不管日本反动派如何丧心病狂，卖国媚外，日本人民还会相信为美国帝国主义充当炮灰去发动侵略亚洲兄弟的战争会给他们带来什么好处吗？
    事情很明白，亚洲的事务应该由亚洲人民自己来管，而决不能容许帝国主义来管。仅仅是代表了摩根、洛克菲勒、杜邦、梅隆这样一小撮大富翁的美国政府，想要越过一万公里的太平洋来支配和奴役亚洲的占全人类半数以上的人口，这是一种疯子的计划，这无论怎样说都是完全没有道理的，无论怎样说都是完全行不通的。
    全中国和全亚洲人民团结起来，打败美国帝国主义奴役亚洲人民的计划！
