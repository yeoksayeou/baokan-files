Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 7th. Our correspondent reports: The American air force, which specializes in bombing peaceful towns and slaughtering peaceful residents, has been severely punished by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. In the ten months since the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army began fighting side by side (October 25th of last year to August 25th of this year), according to incomplete statistics, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies have shot down and damaged 1,482 American aircraft (including a small number belonging to the British Commonwealth Air Force under American air force command), including 1,070 shot down and 412 damaged. Counting only the American aircraft shot down, this is equivalent to more than fourteen fighter squadrons of the American air force (one fighter squadron is calculated as seventy-five aircraft). Most of the enemy personnel in these downed enemy aircraft have either lost their lives or been captured by our army. This massive loss of personnel and aircraft is a major blow to the American aggressors who boast of so-called "air superiority." While the enemy blindly boasts of "air superiority," they cannot help but be alarmed by the ever-increasing threat of our army's anti-aircraft fire. An article in the American "Time Magazine" published on July 30th admitted: "United Nations" aircraft are shot down by our army at an average rate of three to five per day.

Since the Third Campaign, our army has launched a mass anti-aircraft shooting movement, organizing various light and heavy weapons for anti-aircraft shooting, and constantly gaining experience in actual combat, thus increasing the number of enemy aircraft shot down and damaged day by day. During the First, Second, and Third Campaigns, according to incomplete statistics, our army shot down 17 enemy aircraft and damaged 1, totaling 18. During the Fourth Campaign (January 25th to April 21st), according to incomplete statistics, 457 enemy aircraft were shot down and 28 were damaged, totaling 485, averaging slightly less than 5.6 enemy aircraft shot down or damaged per day. From the start of the Fifth Campaign (April 22nd) to June 25th, according to incomplete statistics, 323 enemy aircraft were shot down and 154 were damaged, totaling 477, averaging slightly more than 7.3 enemy aircraft shot down or damaged per day. In the two months from June 26th to August 25th, although there were no large-scale campaigns, our army's ability to fight in the air increased even more. According to incomplete statistics, 273 enemy aircraft were shot down and 229 were damaged during this period, totaling 502, with an average of slightly more than 8.2 enemy aircraft shot down or damaged per day. This average is the highest peak of the number of enemy aircraft shot down or damaged per day in the above-mentioned campaign stages. From the simple statistics above, it can be seen that our army's strike against the American air bandits is becoming heavier and heavier. The glorious achievements of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army in anti-aircraft shooting can illustrate how our army's anti-aircraft shooting achievements are obtained. This unit shot down and damaged 83 enemy aircraft (including 56 shot down) with anti-aircraft weapons and light and heavy machine guns and automatic rifles in less than two months, and has been rewarded with commendations by the leading organs of the Volunteer Army. This unit had very little experience in anti-aircraft shooting when it first entered the Korean battlefield. However, these people's fighters overcame all difficulties and launched a competition to learn technology and shoot down airplanes. Everyone set out a meritorious service plan to shoot down airplanes, thus creating a series of brilliant records.

Among the anti-aircraft shooters of the Korean People's Army, many "Heroes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" have emerged. Byun Ik-doo, the squad leader of a certain anti-aircraft machine gun unit of the People's Army, was awarded the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" on July 5th, and he and his squad have already created the brilliant achievement of shooting down 34 enemy aircraft. From mid-July to the end of July, Byun Ik-doo shot down three enemy bombers by himself.

The heroic anti-aircraft shooters of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies despise the enemy's self-proclaimed "air superiority." Whether on the front lines or in the rear, the anti-aircraft shooters deeply realize that the American flying thieves are very crazy before being attacked, and they are extremely brutal to the peaceful people who have no resistance; but once they are punished, their crazy arrogance plummets. In front of our army's anti-aircraft shooters, these American flying thieves are a bunch of cowards. When four or five come, and one is shot down, the rest dare not linger and flee in panic. When the flying thieves discover that our certain anti-aircraft firepower is strong, they fly high and dare not perform the dive "skills" they used when slaughtering defenseless women and children.

### 中朝人民军队并肩作战十个月来  击落击伤敌机千四百余架  狂吹“空中优势”的美侵略者遭重大打击

    中朝人民军队并肩作战十个月来
    击落击伤敌机千四百余架
    狂吹“空中优势”的美侵略者遭重大打击
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】本社记者报道：擅长于轰炸和平城镇屠杀和平居民的美国空军，遭到朝中人民军队的严重惩罚。自我国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战以来的十个月中（去年十月二十五日至今年八月二十五日），据不完全的统计，朝中人民军队击落击伤美国飞机（其中包括少数属于美国空军指挥的英联邦空军飞机）达一千四百八十二架，内击落一千零七十架，击伤四百一十二架。仅以被击落的美国飞机计算，即等于美国空军十四个多战斗机大队（一个战斗机大队按七十五架计算）。这些被击落的敌机中的敌军人员，绝大部分均已丧命，或被我军俘掳。这种大量人员和飞机的损失，是给狂吹所谓“空军优势”的美国侵略者的一个重大的打击。敌人一方面瞎吹“空军优势”，可是又不得不为我军日益加强的对空射击火力的威胁而感到惊慌。今年七月三十日出版的美国“时代杂志”的一篇文章上就供认：“联合国军”飞机每天平均有三架至五架被我军击落。
    自从第三次战役以后，我军开展了群众性的对空射击运动，组织各种轻重火器进行对空射击，并在实战中不断地取得了经验，因而击落击伤敌机的数目日益增加。在一、二、三次战役期间，据不完全统计，我军击落敌机十七架，击伤一架，共十八架。第四次战役期间（一月二十五日至四月二十一日），据不完全统计，击落敌机四百五十七架，击伤二十八架，共四百八十五架，平均每日击落击伤敌机五点六架弱。自第五次战役开始（四月二十二日）至六月二十五日，据不完全统计，击落敌机三百二十三架，击伤一百五十四架，共四百七十七架，每日平均击落击伤敌机七点三架强。自六月二十六日至八月二十五日的两个月中，虽然没有进行大规模的战役，但是我军对空作战的能力却愈益增加。据不完全统计，在这个期间敌机被击落达二百七十三架，被击伤达二百二十九架，共五百零二架，每日平均被击落击伤的敌机达八点二架强。这个平均数字是上述各战役阶段中每日击落击伤敌机数字的最高峰。从上面简单的统计数字中可以看出，我军对美国空中强盗的打击是一次比一次沉重了。志愿军某部对空射击中的光辉战绩，可以说明我军对空射击的成绩是怎样得来的。这一支部队在不到两个月的时间内，用高射武器和轻重机枪、自动步枪击落击伤敌机八十三架（其中击落五十六架），曾经受到志愿军领导机关的记功的奖励。该部在刚进入朝鲜战场时是很少有对空射击经验的。但是这些人民战士排除一切困难，展开了学技术与打飞机的竞赛。每个人都订出了打飞机的立功计划，从而创造了一连串的光辉的纪录。
    朝鲜人民军的对空射击手中，涌现出很多的“朝鲜人民共和国英雄”。人民军某高射机枪部队小队长边益斗曾在七月五日荣获“朝鲜人民共和国英雄”称号，他和他的小队已经创造了击落敌机三十四架的辉煌战绩。七月中旬到七月底，边益斗一人即击落了三架敌人的轰炸机。
    英勇的朝中人民军队对空射击手们蔑视敌人自吹自擂的所谓“空军优势”。不论是在前线或后方，对空射击手们深深地体会到：美国飞贼在没有受到打击前是非常疯狂的，对付无抵抗力的和平人民更是凶残无比；但当他一受到惩罚后，疯狂的气焰就一落千丈了。在我军对空射击手面前，这些美国飞贼是一群懦夫。来了四五架被打掉一架后，其余的就不敢恋战，仓皇逃窜。当飞贼们发现我某处对空射击火力强时，就飞得高高地再也不敢表演他们在屠杀手无寸铁的妇孺时所用的俯冲“绝技”了。
