Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: In the past two years, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, national industrial and mining hygiene work has made significant achievements. The number of illnesses and injuries in various factories and mines has been greatly reduced, and the health of workers has also been improved.

　　In the past two years, the Central People's Government has successively promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations and various safety and hygiene laws. The health department of the Central People's Government, the health organizations of major administrative regions and provinces and cities, and some industrial departments have established specialized leading bodies for industrial and mining hygiene. Grassroots health organizations have been universally established in industrial and mining areas across the country. Taking the industrial and mining sector in Northeast China as an example, in 1950, the region had four health departments, thirteen health sections, sixteen hospitals and six branch hospitals, two clinics, two hundred and sixty-five health centers, forty-one first-aid stations, twenty-four amateur sanatoriums, twenty-seven nurseries, and thirty-six midwifery stations. Recently, the region is undergoing a major reform in its organizational structure, namely, abolishing health centers within factories and establishing health clinics, specializing in health promotion and education, first aid, and labor hygiene supervision.

　　The number of health personnel in factories and mines across the country has also increased significantly. According to a recent survey of 17,312 factories and mines nationwide, there is an average of one formal physician for every 880 employees. According to statistics from Northeast China, the ratio of industrial and mining health personnel to the number of employees was 1:122.4 in 1949 and 1:84.2 in 1950. In order to accelerate the training of industrial and mining health personnel, seven health technical schools have been established in Northeast China alone. In addition, Central South China and cities such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Shenyang are planning to train factory health workers.

　　The temperature, humidity, ventilation equipment, etc., of general industrial and mining workplaces have been significantly improved. For example, in Tianjin State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 2, the temperature in the yarn factory workshop has dropped from 104 degrees Fahrenheit in the past summer to 94 degrees, and the temperature in the cloth factory workshop has dropped from 95 degrees to 83 degrees. The ventilation volume of mines such as Jingxing, Jiaozuo, Datong, and Yangquan is approximately four cubic meters per person per minute on average. Shanghai Kailin Paint Factory, No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, Taiyuan Tobacco Factory, and other factories have added airtight and spraying devices and improved ventilation equipment, thereby reducing most of the harm to workers' bodies from lead dust and aniline vapor.

　　In order to improve workers' health knowledge, most factories and mines across the country have planned safety and health publicity and education. For example, Qishuyan Railway Factory of Shanghai Railway Administration launched a safety and health campaign in August last year, adopting various methods to carry out publicity and education, so that workers consciously abide by labor discipline and cultivate good hygiene habits. Another example is Nanjing Yongli Alkali Factory, which has ten minutes of "pre-diagnosis education" every day and a weekly health broadcast, and uses comic strips and blackboards for publicity. Factories and mines across the country also combined publicity and education with vaccination, health check-ups, and improvement of environmental hygiene, and mobilized workers to establish various safety and health systems and covenants.

　　Due to the attention and efforts to improve safety and hygiene in various industrial and mining areas, the number of illnesses and injuries in various factories and mines has been greatly reduced in the past two years. According to statistics from 1950, the number of deaths among coal mine workers nationwide decreased by 15% compared to 1949, and the number of injuries decreased by 25%; the mortality rate of coal mine workers nationwide decreased by 35%, and the injury rate decreased by 57%. For example, although there were severe epidemics of cerebrospinal meningitis, relapsing fever, typhoid fever, dysentery, and other infectious diseases in Northeast China last year, very few workers were infected. According to statistics from the region, the incidence of trauma among employees dropped from 8.7% in 1949 to 6.8% in 1950; the mortality rate dropped from 3.8% in the first half of 1949 to 0.78% in 1950. At the same time, due to the increase in medical equipment and the continuous improvement of the political and technical level of medical personnel, the cure rate has also gradually increased.

    全国工矿卫生工作两年来有显著成绩
    【新华社十六日讯】全国工矿卫生工作，两年来在中央人民政府的正确领导下，已有显著的成绩。各厂矿的疾病和伤亡人数大大减少，工人的健康状况也得到改善。
    两年中，中央人民政府曾先后公布了劳动保险条例及各种安全卫生法令。中央人民政府卫生部、各大行政区和各省市的卫生组织及一部分工业部门都建立了专门的工矿卫生领导机构；全国工矿区普遍建立了基层卫生组织。以东北区工矿部门为例，该区在一九五零年即设有四个卫生处、十三个卫生科、十六个医院和六个分院、两个门诊部、二百六十五个卫生所、四十一个急救站、二十四个业余休养所、二十七个托儿所、三十六个助产站。最近该区在组织机构方面正进行重大改革，即撤销工厂内卫生所，成立保健室，专门从事保健宣传教育、急救及劳动卫生监督等工作。
    全国各地厂矿的卫生人员也都大量增加。根据全国一万七千三百一十二个厂矿最近的调查，平均八百八十个职工中有一个正式医师。工矿卫生人员和职工人数的比例，根据东北地区的统计一九四九年是一比一百二十二点四，一九五零年是一比八十四点二。为了加紧培养工矿卫生人员，仅东北一地已成立了七个卫生技术学校，此外中南区及天津、上海、青岛、沈阳等城市均有计划地在训练工厂保健员。
    一般工矿作业场的温湿度、通风设备等都有了显著的改进。如天津国营棉纺二厂，纱厂的车间温度，在今年夏季由过去华氏一百零四度降到九十四度，布厂的车间温度由九十五度降到八十三度。井陉、焦作、大同、阳泉等矿井的通风量平均每人每分钟约为四立方公尺。上海开林油漆厂、第一印染厂、太原烟草厂等均增添了密闭及喷雾装置，改善了通风设备，因而减除了大部分铅粉飞尘与阿尼林蒸气对工人身体的危害。
    为了提高工人的卫生知识水平，各地厂矿大部分都有计划地进行了安全卫生的宣传教育。如上海铁路管理局戚墅堰铁工厂，在去年八月间曾展开安全卫生运动，采取各种方式进行宣传教育，使工人自觉地遵守劳动纪律和培养良好的卫生习惯。再如南京永利錏厂，每日有十分钟的“候诊教育”，每周有一次卫生广播，并利用连环画及黑板报进行宣传。各地厂矿并结合宣传教育进行预防接种、健康检查、改善环境卫生等工作，同时发动工人建立各种安全卫生制度和公约。
    由于各地工矿对安全卫生的重视与努力改进，两年来，各厂矿的疾病和伤亡人数大大减少。据一九五○年的统计，全国煤矿职工死亡人数比一九四九年降低了百分之十五，负伤人数降低了百分之二十五；全国煤矿职工死亡率降低了百分之三十五，负伤率降低了百分之五十七。如去年东北各地虽然发生了剧烈流行的脑脊髓膜炎、回归热、伤寒、赤痢等传染病，但工人患者极少。据该区统计，职工的外伤发生率，由一九四九年的百分之八点七，降到一九五零年的百分之六点八；死亡率由一九四九年上半年的百分之三点八，降到一九五零年百分之零点七八。同时由于医疗设备的增设与医务人员的政治与技术水平的不断提高，治愈率也逐渐增高。
