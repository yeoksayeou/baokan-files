    Cotton Trial Planting Successful in Southern Heilongjiang Province
    The successful trial planting of cotton in the southern part of Heilongjiang Province, located north of 45 degrees north latitude, is now being steadily promoted. This is another new achievement in agricultural production in Northeast China after the land reform.
    Due to the cold climate, Heilongjiang Province was previously considered unsuitable for growing cotton. After liberation, under the government's policy of rewarding cotton planting, many farmers successively studied and tried to grow cotton. Last year, the cotton trial-planted by farmers in Zhaoyu, Baicheng, Tailai and other counties in the southern part of the province generally yielded good harvests. For example, Ai Rongjiu, a farmer in Zhaoyu County who has been trial-planting for many years, achieved a yield of 41 jin of ginned cotton per mu; Sun Tingxun, a farmer in Baicheng County, produced 15 jin of ginned cotton from just over one fen of land, with both yield and quality reaching or exceeding the general level of the South Manchurian cotton area. This fact not only shattered the decadent theory of "cotton cannot be grown north of 42 degrees north latitude" during the puppet Manchukuo regime, but also greatly encouraged farmers' enthusiasm and confidence in growing cotton.
    The people's governments at all levels in Northeast China attach great importance to this new production endeavor. This spring, the southern counties of the province specifically convened cotton planting research conferences. In addition to helping farmers solve problems such as cotton seeds and fertilizers, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also sent technical cadres to guide farmers in trial planting cotton. Therefore, this year, the number of trial planting households has spread to twelve counties, with a total of 2,320 mu of trial planting cotton fields. These cotton fields, due to the farmers' careful cultivation, have generally grown well. Most of them have now flowered and are producing bolls, and it is estimated that each mu will produce at least 50 to 80 jin of seed cotton. In order to promote the work carefully, the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry recently specially invited Professor Feng Zefang of Nanjing University, a well-known cotton expert in China, and others to visit the cotton-producing area. Professor Feng, based on the Michurin theory and his own years of research, believes that cotton suitable planting areas can be gradually shifted northward through human improvement and cultivation. He observed the cotton plants, cotton bolls, boll shapes, and boll colors, and believed that they all met the standards. Given the previous situation where each trial planting household averaged about 20 jin of ginned cotton per mu, he believes that the cotton production in this area is almost the same as the national standard yield. In the future, as long as the cultivation techniques and soil and climate conditions are properly mastered, and promotion is carried out steadily, cotton planting in the southern part of Heilongjiang Province has great prospects.
    (Xinhua News Agency) Note: Taonan, Kaitong and other places in southern Heilongjiang Province have relatively thin soil and do not produce much grain. The success of cotton planting will have a huge impact on the prosperity of the rural economy and the improvement of farmers' lives. To this end, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry will organize representatives of farmers from various counties to visit cotton-producing areas in the near future in order to steadily promote cotton planting work next year.

### 黑龙江省南部地区试种棉花成功

    黑龙江省南部地区
    试种棉花成功
    位置在北纬四十五度以北的黑龙江省南部地区试种棉花成功，现正稳步进行推广，这是东北在土地改革后农业生产上的又一新的成就。
    黑龙江省由于气候较冷，过去一直被认为不能种棉。解放后，在人民政府奖励植棉的政策下，许多农民相继研究试种棉花。去年，该省南部的瞻榆、白城、泰来等县农民试种的棉花，收成普遍良好。如试种多年的瞻榆县农民艾荣久，每亩产量达皮棉四十一斤；白城县农民孙廷勋种一分多地即产十五斤皮棉，产量和质量都达到或超过南满棉区的一般水平。这一事实，不但打破了伪满时“北纬四十二度以北不能种棉”的陈腐论调，并大大地鼓舞了农民种棉的热情和信心。
    东北各级人民政府对于这一新的生产事业极为重视。今年春天，该省南部各县专门召开了种棉研究会。省农林厅除协助农民解决棉籽、肥料等问题外，还派出技术干部指导农民试种棉花。因此，今年试种农户遍及十二个县，试种棉田共达二千三百二十亩。这些棉田，由于农民的加意培育，作物普遍生长良好，现大部都已开桃吐絮，估计每亩最少能产籽棉五十斤到八十斤。东北人民政府农林部为慎重进行推广工作，最近特聘请国内著名棉作专家南京大学冯泽芳教授等多人，前往该产棉地参观。冯教授根据米邱林学说及自己多年的研究，认为棉花适种地区是可以用人力改良培育而逐渐北移的。他观察了棉株、棉桃、桃形、桃色等，认为都合乎标准。鉴于以往各试种户每亩平均产皮棉二十斤左右的情况，他认为该地的产棉量比全国标准产量差不多。今后只要适当掌握耕作技术及土壤、气候等条件，稳步加以推广，在黑龙江省南部植棉很有前途。
    按：黑龙江省南部洮南、开通等地，土地较薄，产粮不多，植棉成功后，对于繁荣农村经济及改善农民生活将发生巨大作用。为此，该省农林厅将于最近组织各县农民代表前往产棉地参观，以便明年稳步推广植棉工作。（新华社）
