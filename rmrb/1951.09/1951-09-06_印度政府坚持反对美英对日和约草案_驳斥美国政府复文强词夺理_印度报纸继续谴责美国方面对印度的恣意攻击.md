Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: New Delhi dispatch: The Indian government, in a note to the U.S. government on August 28 regarding the peace treaty with Japan, replied to the U.S. government's reply on August 26 to the Indian government's note refusing to participate in the San Francisco conference. In the note, the Indian government persisted in its views on the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and refuted the sophistical arguments in the U.S. government's reply.

Regarding the sovereignty of the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands, the Indian note refuted the arguments in the U.S. reply, saying: "Although the Indian government suggested returning sovereignty over the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands to Japan, it does not oppose the surrender terms of the Potsdam Proclamation. The U.S. government itself has pointed out that such terms allow for the addition of small islands to the main islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, over which Japan can exercise sovereignty, by agreement."

The Indian note refuted the U.S. reply's argument that failure to sign the "U.S.-Japan Military Agreement" would leave Japan "in a state of complete defenselessness," saying: "The Indian government believes that there is no basis for drawing such a conclusion from anything they have said." "The Indian government does not understand why Japan would have a so-called 'period of complete defenselessness'."

Regarding the Taiwan issue, the Indian note reiterated India's position, stating: "The Indian government suggests that in accordance with international obligations, the treaty should explicitly stipulate the return of Taiwan to China." "The Indian government has believed in the past, and still believes, that declaring Taiwan's return to China will help create conditions for achieving stability in the Far East."

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: New Delhi dispatch: Indian newspapers continue to publish commentaries supporting the Indian government's opposition to the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan and condemning the arbitrary attacks by the U.S. side on India. The "Bombay Chronicle" wrote in an editorial on the 1st: "Almost every time India and the United States have any differences of opinion on any international issue, some Americans invariably use vulgar, trivial, and disgusting language and attitudes to harp on the issue of lending wheat, and make wild statements about motivations." The newspaper pointed out: "The various vulgar ridicules about lending wheat to India are actually a dangerous confession by those Americans who have guilty consciences. They make people think of the question: Is lending wheat meant to exchange for India's self-respect and freedom?"

The "National Standard" stated in an editorial on the 1st: "As long as the United States unreasonably demands that India accept its foreign policy as the price of friendship, or accuses India of harboring hostility whenever India raises questions about certain aspects of this policy, mutual understanding is impossible."

The "Indian Express" stated in an editorial on the 1st: "The root cause of the recent U.S.-India relations lies in the intolerance of others' independent views."

    印度政府坚持反对美英对日和约草案
    驳斥美国政府复文强词夺理
    印度报纸继续谴责美国方面对印度的恣意攻击 【新华社四日讯】新德里消息：印度政府在八月二十八日致美国政府关于对日和约的照会一件，答复美国政府八月二十六日对印度政府拒绝参加旧金山会议的照会的复文。印度政府在照会中坚持它对美英对日和约草案的意见，并反驳了美国政府复文中强词夺理的辩论。
    关于琉球和小笠原群岛的主权问题，印度照会反驳美国复文的辩论说：“印度政府虽然建议归还日本对琉球和小笠原群岛的主权，却并不反对波茨坦公告的投降条款。美国政府自己曾指出，这种条款容许以协议方式把一些小岛加入日本得以行使主权的本州、北海道、九州、四国诸岛。”
    印度照会反驳美国复文所谓不签订“美日军事协定”则将使日本“陷于毫无防御的状态”的论点说：“印度政府认为没有任何根据可以从他们所说的任何话中得出这种结论。”“印度政府不明了，为什么日本竟会有所谓‘完全无防御状态的时期’。”
    关于台湾问题，印度照会重申印度的主张说：“印度政府建议遵照国际义务，和约中应明白规定把台湾归还中国。”“印度政府过去曾经认为、现在也仍然认为：宣布台湾归还中国，将有助于创造在远东求得安定的条件。” 【新华社四日讯】新德里消息：印度报纸继续发表评论，拥护印度政府反对美国对日和约草案，并斥责美国方面对印度的恣意攻击。“孟买纪事报”一日社论写道：“差不多每当印度和美国对任何国际问题的看法有任何分歧的时候，一定有些美国人会用粗俗、无聊、可厌的言语和态度大吹贷小麦的事，而且信口开河地说动机如何如何。”该报指出：“关于贷小麦给印度一事的种种粗俗的嘲弄，实际上就是那些心里有鬼的美国人的危险的招供。他们使人们想到这样一个问题：难道贷小麦是为了换取印度的自尊和自由吗？”
    “民族旗帜报”一日社论说：“只要美国一天无理要求印度接受它的外交政策，作为友谊的代价，或者每当印度对这种政策的某些方面提出疑问，美国就指责印度怀有敌意，那么互相谅解是不可能的。”
    “印度快报”一日社论说：“不容别人有独立见解，就是最近美国对印关系的症结所在。”
