    A Model of Insisting on Education in Disaster Areas Through Revolutionary Methods
    ——An Introduction to the Anhui Northern Anhui Disaster Area Education Exhibition Section of the First National Elementary Education Exhibition
    To cooperate with the first National Elementary Education and Normal Education Conference, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government simultaneously held the first Elementary Education Exhibition. The exhibition displayed more than 10,000 exhibits sent by major administrative regions and provinces and cities. These included various teaching aids, teaching materials, textbooks, children's works, toys, summaries of teaching experiences, educational materials, and photos and statistical charts of various school activities for primary schools and kindergartens. These exhibits fully demonstrated the rapid development of elementary education in New China, and also demonstrated the high enthusiasm and creativity of educators. The most prominent were the exhibits sent from the severely affected areas of northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu.
    In northern Anhui, due to the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and years of natural and man-made disasters, people's lives were miserable and education stagnated. However, since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, educators in the disaster areas of northern Anhui, in the face of extremely serious disaster conditions, have closely relied on the masses, used revolutionary selfless spirit, and persisted in education while engaging in production and disaster relief. The more than 30 kinds of wild vegetable specimens on display at the exhibition were the main food collected by teachers and children in the disaster area.
    Xuyi is one of the severely affected areas in the Chuxian Prefecture of northern Anhui. However, the elementary education workers in Xuyi County came up with various methods to insist on implementing the educational policy of "fully integrating production and disaster relief, flexibly using various teaching forms and methods, and appropriately adjusting educational funding expenditures to achieve consolidation and persistence of primary education in disaster areas," creating many miracles of persisting in education in disaster areas.
    From a set of comic strips, we can see the actual situation of persisting in education in Xuyi County, northern Anhui, during the famine. This set of paintings vividly portrays the spirit of educators in Xuyi County persisting in running schools during the famine. They overcame the past formalistic and detached-from-the-masses teaching methods; convened meetings of the school board, enthusiastic educationists, and parent representatives to study and discuss ways to persist in elementary education, mobilize children to attend school, and propose to children's parents a guarantee: to lead children to study and engage in production at the same time. At the same time, they put forward slogans such as "The wild is a university, production and reading will help survive the disaster," and "Reading while grazing cattle is beneficial for literacy," so that children's parents realized that literacy for students would not hinder production. In this way, this outdoor university was established. Therefore, the school organized various study groups according to children's daily production habits for production learning, such as the "grass picking group," "mat weaving group," "vegetable picking group," "medicine digging group," and "herding and reading group," etc. In terms of teaching methods, they were also determined according to the disaster situation and the needs of the masses. Most of them adopted methods such as "half-day system," "alternate-day system," and mobile literacy and outdoor teaching, with students going wherever the teacher went. Children who arrived first would put up a red flag as a sign of concentration; children who arrived later would use this to find the gathering target, and the teacher would use the rest time for teaching. Therefore, wherever the red flag was planted, that was the classroom.
    Under the slogan of production and disaster relief, although many difficulties were overcome, it was still impossible to do a good job in teaching without teaching aids or learning tools. Teachers used their wisdom and revolutionary enthusiasm to create many teaching aids. These teaching aids may look rough and simple, but they solved the difficulties in teaching. For example, in mathematics teaching, they created wooden tangrams, clay abacuses, bamboo abacuses, etc. In natural science teaching, there were self-made periscopes, self-made electromagnet models, self-made lunar eclipse models, self-made water pressure testers, self-made globes, and various mechanics toys. For example, the children of Lifengqiao Elementary School in Xuyi County did not have money to buy pens, so Banqiao Elementary School in Mengcheng County and neighboring brother schools sent them self-made "reed pens," "goose feather pens," "wooden fountain pens," "dog hair brushes," and "bamboo pens," etc. At the same time, they also used charcoal, yellow soil, red soil, black soil, and coal as writing tools, or made various chalks with a little manual work. Although their teaching and learning tools were so simple, the students' grades were not lowered as a result. These teaching aids and students' homework were all displayed at the exhibition. Life in the disaster area was so hard and tense, but the children's cultural and recreational activities were very active. They used various waste materials, such as paper scraps, rags, wood, cigarette cases, eggshells, bamboo, etc., to make many toys. In short, teachers and students tried their best to enrich children's cultural and recreational activities.
    In the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, educators in the disaster areas mobilized the masses to write letters of sympathy and make comfort bags to express the love of the people, teachers, and children in the disaster areas for the great motherland and the volunteer army comrades. Their spirit of persisting in work educated us that only when the people's educators are truly working with a revolutionary spirit can they come up with various ways to overcome all difficulties and create excellent results.

    用革命的办法坚持灾区教育的范例
    ——第一次全国初等教育展览会皖北灾区教育展览部分的介绍
    为了配合全国第一次初等教育及师范教育会议，中央人民政府教育部同时举办了第一次初等教育展览会。展览会上陈列着由各大行政区、各省市送来的展览品一万余件。其中包括有小学及幼儿院各种教学用具、教材、教科书、儿童作品、玩具，教学经验总结、教育资料，以及学校各种活动照片、统计图表等。这些展览品，充分地说明了新中国初等教育的飞跃发展，同时也表现了教育工作者们高度的积极性与创造性。其中最突出的，是皖北、苏北重灾区送来的展览品。
    在皖北，由于过去国民党反动派的长期统治，和历年的天灾人祸，人民生活痛苦，教育工作停滞不前。但是，解放以来，在共产党领导下，皖北灾区教育工作者，在极严重的灾情下，紧紧地依靠群众，以革命的忘我精神，一面生产救灾，一面坚持教育工作。展览会中陈列着的三十多种野菜标本，便是灾区教师们和孩子们所采集的主要食物。
    盱眙是皖北滁县分区的重灾区之一，但盱眙县的初等教育工作者，却想出种种办法，坚持执行了“全力结合生产救灾、灵活运用各种教学形式和方法，适当的调剂教育经费开支，以达巩固与坚持灾区小学教育”的教育方针，创造了许多坚持灾区教育的奇迹。
    从一套连环画上，我们可以看到皖北盱眙县在灾荒中坚持教育工作的实际情况。这套画生动地表现了盱眙县教育工作者在灾荒中坚持办学的精神。他们克服了过去形式主义的、脱离群众的教学方法；召开了校董会与热心教育人士及家长代表会议，研究和讨论坚持小学教育工作的办法，动员儿童入学，并向儿童家长提出保证：领导儿童一边学习，一边生产。同时，又提出“野外是个大学堂，生产读书度灾荒”、“放牛带读书，识字有好处”等口号，使儿童家长认识了学生识字决不妨碍生产。这样，这个野外的大学堂就办起来了。于是，学校就根据儿童日常生产习惯编为各种学习小组，进行生产学习，如“拾草组”、“编席组”、“挑菜组”、“挖药组”以及“牧读团”等。在教学方式方法上，他们也是根据灾情和群众的需要来决定的。大多是采用“半日制”、“间日制”及巡回送字与野外教学等方法，学生到那里，先生到那里。先去的儿童，将红旗插起，作为集中的标志；后去的儿童便以此而寻找集合目标，先生就利用休息时间进行教学。因此，红旗插到那里，那里就是教室。
    在生产救灾的口号下，虽然克服了不少困难，但是，要搞好教学，没有教学用具，没有学习工具也是不行的。教师们便运用自己的智慧和革命的劳动热情，创造了许许多多教学用具。这些教学用具，看起来是粗糙简单的，但是它们却解决了教学上的困难。比如在数学教学方面，创制了木制七巧板、泥制算盘、竹制大算盘等。在自然课教学方面，有自制潜望镜、自制电磁铁模型、自制月蚀模型、自制水压试验器、自制地球仪、以及各种力学的玩具。又如盱眙县立丰登桥小学的儿童们没有钱买笔，蒙城县板桥小学和临近的兄弟学校便给他们送去自制的“芦笔”、“鹅毛笔”、“木制钢笔”、“狗毛制毛笔”、“竹笔”等；同时，他们自己还用木炭、黄土、红土、黑土、石炭等作为书写的工具，或稍加人工制成各种粉笔。虽然，他们的教学和学习用具这样简陋，但是学生的成绩并未因此而降低。这些教学用具及学生们的作业，全部陈列在展览会上。灾区的生活是这样的艰苦和紧张，但是儿童们的文化娱乐活动很活跃。他们利用各种废物，如纸片、破布、木头、纸烟盒、蛋壳、竹子等，制造了许多玩具。总之，教师和学生们，想尽了种种办法，来充实儿童们的文化娱乐活动。
    在抗美援朝运动中，灾区的教育工作者发动群众写慰问信，做慰问袋，以表示灾区人民、教师和儿童们对伟大祖国和志愿军同志们的热爱。他们这种坚持工作的精神教育了我们，一个人民的教育工作者，只有当他们真正怀着一种革命的精神进行工作时，他们才能够想出种种的办法来克服一切的困难，创造出优良的成绩。（吴洛）
