Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 4)
    Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi

    Sixth Paragraph Subject-Predicate Phrases

    In the second paragraph of the first lecture, we have already given a simple explanation of the nature of subject-predicate phrases, and in the fourth paragraph, we also gave many examples. The subject-predicate phrase is a very useful grammatical form; like all useful things, it is inevitable that it will be overused. The following is a categorized explanation.

    The word "的" should be deleted. Regarding subject-predicate phrases, the first thing to remember is that it is only a phrase, and cannot be used as a sentence. The following two sentences make this mistake:

    (1) The promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China has been a year. (Newspaper)

    (2) Unexpectedly, in March of this year, the price drop gradually stabilized later. (Work)

    These two sentences add the word "的" between the subject and the predicate, forming a phrase, so these two sentences become without a verb. Not only that, the meaning of (2) also changes. It is not "price" that is stable, but "drop" that is stable. (1) should be changed to "has been promulgated for a year." (2) should remove the word "的". Let's look at these three sentences:

    (3) It is also necessary to equip several sets of children's books, popular books, pictorials, etc., for the use of the general public and children. (Periodical)

    (4) It even controls the "materials" without conducting research, further hindering other experts and scholars from conducting research. (Periodical)

    (5) What deserves our gratitude the most... is the arrival of Soviet epidemiologists and the Soviet anti-epidemic expedition designated by the Soviet government at the request of the Chinese People's Government. (Periodical)

    Here, "application," "conduct," and "arrival" are all the second verb in the second type of complex predicate (see paragraph 4 of the first lecture), and the word "的" cannot be added before them. The reason for this error is that two structures are regarded as one thing:

    (A) Waiting for -- [their failure]

    (B) Supply -- them -- application.

    In formula (A), "they" is the subject of "failure," but not the object of "waiting"; the object of "waiting" is the sentence form "their failure," which can be changed into a phrase by adding the word "的." In formula (B), "they" is the subject of "application," and also the object of "supply." "They apply" here is not a sentence form, and cannot form a phrase. Therefore, the word "的" in (3), (4), and (5) should be removed. There is no need to add "着" after "hinder" in (4). (5) "Designate... arrival" is still inappropriate, it can be changed to "assign... to China", but it is not as good as "sent…". The two "Soviet" at the end should also be deleted. The experts and expedition team sent by the Soviet government are of course Soviet, is it necessary to say? The word "的" in the following two sentences can be used or not:

    (6) Due to the dynastic turmoil and climate humidity, almost all contemporary paintings were destroyed. (Periodical)

    (7) Chief Captain Jiang Yaode repeatedly mentioned in his conversation with the author that the research spirit of Soviet friends is worthy of admiration and learning. (Periodical)

    The subject-predicate phrases in these two sentences are the objects of "due to" and "mention," and the word "的" is used well. However, the word "的" can also be added between "dynastic" and "turmoil" in (6) without being added. For the sake of syntactic neatness, there is no need to add "的" between "climate" and "humidity." ("Suffered destruction" is not as good as "all destroyed.") (7) uses the word "的" twice in a row. Since the second "的" is optional, it is better to delete it.

    The initiative of the verb should be restored. The verbs in the subject-predicate phrases in the following sentences are all in the passive sense:

    (8) The use of language by Mr. Lao She is worth learning from. (Newspaper)

    (9) Starting to implement Stalin's great plan to change nature, with the establishment of a series of protective forest zones, the vast cultivated land can avoid drought. (Newspaper)

    (10) The experience of the past year proves that the destruction of the old marriage system, replaced by the new marriage system stipulated in the Marriage Law, is as fierce a struggle as other social reforms. (Newspaper)

    (11) The current semester has already begun, and the teaching of Chinese history in middle schools may involve lecturing on the history of the Yuan Dynasty in a month or two. (Newspaper)

    (12) The formulation of this new classification method for books and materials should not only accommodate the past and adapt to the present, but also need to recruit the future. (Periodical)

    Various languages do not like to use passive voice too much, because passive voice is not as natural and powerful as active voice. This is true for verbs in sentences, and also for verbs in phrases. For this reason alone, the subject-predicate phrases in these five sentences should be avoided; in addition, the latter three sentences have other problems. (8) should be changed to "Mr. Lao She's use of language" or "Mr. Lao She's skill in using language." (9) should be changed to "Establish a series of..." (Also, "great" is newly created, it is better to use "great"; "can" is also unnecessary, the word "can" is enough.) (10) "Destroy" and "replace" should be parallel, but now they cannot be smoothly connected, far inferior to "destroying the old marriage system and replacing it with...". From a formal point of view, the above three sentences cannot be regarded as wrong. (11) and (12) are different. From a formal point of view, the subject of "make" is "teaching," and the subject of "accommodate" and so on is "formulation." How does this make sense? Therefore, these two phrases are more unacceptable than the previous three sentences. (11) should be changed to "Middle schools teach Chinese history, and in a month or two, they will be talking about the history of the Yuan Dynasty." (12) should be changed to "This time the formulation...classification method (or: the...classification method formulated this time) should not only be able to accommodate the past and adapt to the present, but also be able to take care of the future" ("Recruiting the future" is difficult to understand).

    Subject-subordinate phrases should be used instead. The following three sentences use subject-predicate phrases, posing and being very unnatural.

    (13) The soaring prices locked the people's necks with iron chains, and the cruel conscription and grain collection sucked the people's blood dry. (Newspaper)

    (14) The Soviet Union organized archaeological work when building the Moscow subway. They hope that the brilliance of their achievements can also appear in our capital. (Newspaper)

    (15) The author answered this question in another novel "Virgin Land" soon after it was raised. (Work)

    Should be changed to "cruel conscription and grain collection," "brilliant achievements," "the questions raised here." The following sentence does not need to reverse the order within the phrase, but "regarding" should be added in front to clarify the meaning.

    (16) This kind of criticism is actually still inevitable to become an insult to the author. (Book)

    Seventh Paragraph Extraclausal Components and Similar Phenomena

    Extraclausal Components. Extraclausal components were mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the first lecture. This is a commonly used format in our Chinese language, but there are appropriate and inappropriate ways to use it. The following are examples of appropriate use:

    (1) Seventeen or eighteen-year-old children, teach them to chew on "Das Kapital" and "Anti-Dühring." (Mao)

    (2) Those who like to talk about this kind of empty theory should extend a finger and scrape their faces. (Mao)

    (3) Some people, I see that they are too much trouble for us, I feel sorry, but they always say with a smile, "I like to work." (Teach)

    (4) Eliminating classes, eliminating state power, eliminating the party, all mankind must follow this path, the problem is only time and conditions. (Mao)

    (5) Her three children, one works in the People's Liberation Army, one is a nurse, and one is studying architecture.

    This format is applied, either due to passive reasons, that this component is relatively long and cumbersome to place in its original position; or due to active reasons, to make this component prominent, or to facilitate connection with the previous text; most of the time, both reasons are combined. When applying this format, a pronoun is generally used in the original position, such as "he" and "they" in the first three examples; there are also those that are not pronouns, such as the latter two examples. However, "this path" in (4) refers to the "eliminating classes" etc. above, and the three "one"s in (5) refer to the "three children" above, and the connection between the front and the back is very clear.

    The following two sentences are not very appropriate in adopting the extraclausal format:

    (6) Like Zhang Huichun's experience, I believe there may have been such an incident. (Newspaper)

    (7) The model worker Ji Haoran is remodeling the vacuum cleaner and bamboo pulp machine. After Zhao Guoyou gave him enthusiastic encouragement, Ji Haoran has now completed it ahead of schedule. (Periodical)

    "This kind of incident" in (6) can be omitted. Delete the word "的" in (7), and let this extraclausal component become a clause, and the whole sentence will be more fluent. Contrary to these two sentences, the following sentence is an example of a extraclausal format that should have been used but was not:

    (8) It is now more prominently important to attract the people to openly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers and periodicals, and to educate party members, especially party cadres, to make self-criticism on these shortcomings and errors in newspapers and periodicals. (Newspaper)

    The subject of this sentence is very long (sixty-one words), and a "这" should be added before "today" to turn the original subject into an extraclausal component. In this way, the organization of the whole sentence will be clearer. (Compare with the second example in paragraph 7 of the first lecture.)

    Detached Components. Some sentences have a component at the beginning that is not only independent of the sentence structure, but also not connected to any word in the sentence, and cannot be regarded as an extraclausal word. Let's call it a "detached component" for now. Of course, detachment is only in terms of form: in terms of meaning, it is inseparable from the rest of the sentence. For example:

    (9) In this matter, the Chinese people have too much experience. (Mao)

    Here, "this matter" is equivalent to "in this matter" or "regarding this matter." This format is one of the vivid and lively syntaxes in our spoken language, but it must be used with caution. The following four sentences are not used properly.

    (10) All this, when I watched Mr. Lao She's another play "Fang Zhenzhu" performed, made me recall the old experiences one by one. (Newspaper)

    (11) Regarding these questions, when we arrived in Qingpu County, where seventeen local tyrants were killed in five days, the actual situation we understood was this... (Periodical)

    (12) The so-called big fight refers to fighting on a worldwide scale and fighting for a long time, but in these two situations, what is obviously unfavorable is US imperialism, not us. (Periodical)

    (13) Some factories and mines also change quotas and plans at will, making workers feel that this kind of screw-tightening policy cannot meet the administrative requirements no matter how hard they try. (Draft)

    (10) should say "All this...made me...". (The "了" in "watched" is not appropriate, it should be removed.) (11) should say "Regarding these questions". (12) should say "These two situations are obviously unfavorable to US imperialism rather than unfavorable to us." (13) should say "This is a screw-tightening policy."

    Another type of detached component is like this:

    (14) According to most people, there will not be too much rain this year.

    (15) According to Mongolia's past traditions, those who cause fires in the grasslands should be executed. (Periodical)

    The meaning here is "according to most people's opinion" "according to Mongolian traditional customs" ("past" can be omitted); it can also be said that "most people's opinion is" "Mongolian traditional customs are". The following three sentences are similar to this format but should not adopt this format.

    (16) After more than twenty days of work, I have gained a lot. (Newspaper)

    (17) A large number of model workers emerged during the production meritorious campaign in May this year. (Periodical)

    (18) I think that the group life occupies a very important part in the help that Geda gave me in the matter of self-transformation. (Newspaper)

    "In" should be added in (16) and (17)..." ". (18) should add "Speaking of" at the beginning. Or add "one of them" before "a very important part" to make the detached component at the beginning of the sentence an extraclausal word. (The "着" in "occupies" is redundant, and "occupies" and "part" do not correspond. Either "occupies ... position" or "is ... part".)

    Detached Subject-Predicate Phrases. In ancient times, subject-predicate phrases could be used as a clause, such as: "When the Great Way is practiced, the world is for the common good." But we know that the subject-predicate phrase in modern language is less of a revival of the ancient format and more of an input of foreign grammar. Generally, it is only used as a subject, object, or predicate complement, and is not often used to replace a clause in a complex sentence. Therefore, the subject-predicate phrases in the following three sentences make people feel disorganized and unsettled.

    (19) France's disastrous defeat in the Vietnam War, its only urgent requirement is to hope that the US will come to the rescue, not others. (Periodical)

    (20) However, due to the complexity of the ethnic situation, coupled with the shortness of time, this work can only be said to be the beginning of learning. (Periodical)

    (21) For the collection of reference materials, whether solicited or ordered, in order to obtain better results, it is necessary to first put in some solid effort on the interview of the materials. (Periodical)

    (19) can be changed to "France's disastrous defeat in Vietnam". (20) can be changed to "But because the ethnic situation is complex, plus the time is short". (21) can be changed to "Collecting reference materials". This sentence has other problems. The following should be changed to "Whether using solicitation or ordering, in order to obtain better results, it is necessary to first put in some solid effort on the interview of the materials". The following sentence seems勉强 can be.

    (22) The general explanation for the weakness of commentary work is the lack of cultivated writing cadres. (Newspaper)

    But it is better to change it to "The reason why commentary work is weak", which is a format inherited from classical Chinese and still commonly used in modern times to replace clauses with phrases.

    Non-Detached Components. There is a format that looks like a detached component, but it is not. For example:

    (23) Every coal well and passage, the supporting pillars are all steel-reinforced concrete. (Newspaper)

    (24) The Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Group, after a long period of political and cultural study, has improved its class consciousness. (Periodical)

    (23) "Every coal well and passage" is the subject of the sentence, and the predicate is a sentence form. (24) is the same, but the predicate has two parts, the second of which is a sentence form. (See examples 38, 39, and 40 in paragraph 4 of the first lecture.)

    The following are two ambiguous examples.

    (25) After liberation, under the leadership of the people's government, all restoration and construction work in Jinggang Mountain has been vigorously carried out. (Periodical)

    (26) In the Shanghai opera circle, it is precisely "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, there is another village with bright flowers", and an infinitely bright future unfolds before our eyes. (Periodical)

    (25) A "In" should be added at the beginning, or changed to "After liberation, under the leadership of the people's government, all...of Jinggang Mountain." (26) "Its" should be added before "before our eyes" to connect it with "Shanghai opera circle" and make it an extraclausal word.

    Extraclausal components, detached components, and sentence forms as predicates are all inherent, lively, and vivid formats in our language, but they must be used very carefully. If you are not careful, some words will become disorganized and unsettled. There is often only a slight difference between using them appropriately and inappropriately. When you are not sure, it is better to adopt a more clearly organized syntax. (End of this section, the full text is not finished)

    语法、修辞讲话（第四讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第六段  主谓短语
    在第一讲的第二段里，我们对于主谓短语的性质已经有简单的说明，在第四段里也举了好些例子。主谓短语是个很有用的语法形式；跟所有有用的东西一样，也不免有用得太滥的情形。下面分类说明。
    应该删去“的”字。关于主谓短语，第一要记住，它只是一个短语，不能把它当句子用。下面这两句就是犯了这个错误：
    （一）中华人民共和国婚姻法的公布已经一年了。（报）
    （二）出人意料的，今年三月，物价的下跌，后来慢慢地稳定。（作）这两句在主语和谓语中间加上个“的”字，做成短语，于是这两个句子就变成没有动词了。不但这样，（二）的意思也变了，不是“物价”稳定，而是“下跌”稳定了。（一）应改为“已经公布了一年了”。（二）应删去“的”字。再看这三句：
    （三）还要配备若干套的儿童书、通俗书、画报等等，供给一般群众和儿童们的应用。（期）
    （四）甚至把持着“材料”并不进行研究，更阻碍着其他专家、学者们的进行研究。（期）
    （五）最值得我们感谢……的是苏联政府应中国人民政府之请，指定苏联流行病专家和苏联防疫远征队的到来。（期）这里面的“应用”“进行”“到来”都是第二类型的复杂谓语里的第二个动词（见第一讲第四段），前面不能加“的”字。所以会有这种错误，是因为把两种结构看成一种东西：
    （甲）等待——【他们失败】
    （乙）供给——他们——应用。（甲）式的“他们”是“失败”的主语，但不是“等待”的宾语；“等待”的宾语是“他们失败”这个句子形式，这是可以加个“的”字改成短语的。（乙）式的“他们”是“应用”的主语，同时又是“供给”的宾语，“他们应用”在这里不是一个句子形式，不能成短语。所以（三）（四）（五）的“的”字都要取消。（四）的“阻碍”之后不必加“着”。（五）“指定……到来”还是不妥，可以改做“指派……来华”，但不如“派来了”。后面两个“苏联”也应该删去，苏联政府派的专家和远征队当然是苏联的，还用说？底下这两句里的“的”字可用可不用：
    （六）由于历代动乱及气候的潮湿，几乎所有当时的绘画遭受毁灭。（期）
    （七）蒋耀德总队长对笔者的谈话中一再提到苏联朋友的研究精神的值得敬佩与学习。（期）这两句的主谓短语是“由于”和“提到”的宾语，“的”字是用得不错的。但是（六）的“历代”和“动乱”中间也可加“的”字而没有加，为了句法整齐，“气候”和“潮湿”中间也就不必加“的”。（“遭受毁灭”不如“都毁了”。）（七）连用两个“的”字，既然第二个“的”字可有可无，不如删去。应该恢复动词的主动性。底下这些句子的主谓短语里的动词都是被动意义的：
    （八）老舍先生语言的运用，值得我们好好学习。（报）
    （九）开始执行斯大林改变自然的壮伟的计划，以一系列的防护森林地带的建立，使广大的耕田得能避免旱灾。（报）
    （十）一年来的经验证明，旧婚姻制度的摧毁，代之以婚姻法规定的新的婚姻制度，和其他的社会改革一样，是剧烈的斗争。（报）
    （十一）本学期已经开始，中学校本国史的教学，可能一两个月里面要作元史的讲授。（报）
    （十二）这次新的图书资料分类法的制定应该不仅是容纳过去，适应现在，更需要罗致未来。（期）各种语言都不喜欢多用被动式，因为被动式不及主动式自然而有力。句子里的动词是如此，短语里的动词也是如此。单单为了这一点，这五句里的主谓短语就应该避免；除此以外，后三句还有别的毛病。（八）应改为“老舍先生的运用语言”或“老舍先生运用语言的技巧”。（九）应改为“建立一系列的……”。（又，“壮伟”生造，宜用“伟大”；“得能”也不必，“能”字已够。）（十）“摧毁”和“代”应该平行，现在弄得不能顺顺当当地连接，远不如“摧毁旧婚姻制度而代之以……”。以上三句，单从形式上看，还不能算错，（十一）和（十二）就不同了，从形式上看，“作”的主语是“教学”，“容纳”等等的主语是“制定”，这怎么讲的通呢？所以这两个短语比前面三句更要不得。（十一）该改做“中学校教授本国史，一两个月里就要讲到元史”。（十二）该改做“这次制定……分类法（或：这次制定的……分类法），不仅要能容纳过去，适应现在，还要能照顾将来”（“罗致未来”费解）。
    应该改用主从短语。底下这三句用主谓短语，装腔作势，非常不自然。
    （十三）物价飞涨的铁链锁住了人民的脖子，徵兵徵粮的残酷抽干了人民的鲜血。（报）
    （十四）苏联修建莫斯科地下铁道时组织了考古工作。他们成绩的辉煌希望也能在我们的首都出现。（报）
    （十五）这个问题的提出，作者不久就在另一部小说“处女地”中予以解答。（作）应该改做“残酷的征兵征粮”“辉煌的成绩”“这里提出的问题”。底下这一句无须颠倒短语内部的次序，但是应该在前面加“对于”，意思才能明确。
    （十六）这种批评其实仍然不免成为作者的侮辱。（书）
    第七段外位成分和类似的现象
    外位成分。第一讲的第五段里提到过外位成分。这是我们汉语常用的一种格式，但是也有用得恰当不恰当的分别。底下这些是用得恰当的例子：
    （一）十七八岁的娃娃，教他们啃“资本论”“反杜林论”。（毛）
    （二）好谈这种空洞理论的人，应该伸出一个指头向他刮脸皮。（毛）
    （三）有些人，我看见他们为我们太麻烦了，我感到抱歉，他们可总是笑着说，“我喜欢工作”。（教）
    （四）消灭阶级，消灭国家权力，消灭党，全人类都要走这一条路的，问题只是时间和条件。（毛）
    （五）她的三个孩子，一个在解放军里工作，一个是护士，一个在学建筑。应用这个格式，或是由于消极的原因，这个成分比较长，放在本位上嫌笨重；或是由于积极的原因，要使这个成分突出，或是便于和上文联络；多半是两种原因兼而有之。应用这个格式，一般是在本位上用个代词，如前三例的“他”和“他们”；也有不是代词的，如后二例。但（四）的“这一条路”指上面“消灭阶级”等等，（五）的三个“一个”指上面的“三个孩子”，前后的联系是很明白的。
    下面这两句采用外位的格式就不很恰当：
    （六）像张惠春的遭遇，我相信可能有过这种事件。（报）
    （七）劳模计浩然正在改装的吸尘机及打竹浆机，赵国有给了他热烈的鼓励后，现在计浩然已提早把它完成了。（期）（六）的“这种事件”可省。（七）删去“的”字，让这个外位成分变成一个分句，全句就更加流畅了。跟这两句相反，底下这句是应该用而没有用外位格式的例子：
    （八）吸引人民群众在报纸刊物上公开地批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，并教育党员，特别是党的干部，在报纸刊物上作关于这些缺点和错误的自我批评，在今天是更加突出地重要起来了。（报）这一句的主语很长（六十一个字），应该在“在今天”前面加个“这”，让原来的主语变成外位成分。这样，全句的组织就更加清楚些。（比较第一讲第七段第二例。）
    游离成分。有些句子的头上有一个成分，不但独立在句子组织之外，并且不跟句子里边的哪一个词联系，不能算是外位语。这，我们姑且管它叫“游离成分”。当然，游离只是就形式说：就意义说，它跟句子的其余部分是分不开的。例如：
    （九）这件事，中国人民的经验是太多了。（毛）这里的“这件事”等于“在这件事上”或“关于这件事”。这种格式本是我们口语里生动活泼的句法之一，可是用起来得小心。底下这四句用得不妥。
    （十）这种种，在我看了老舍先生另一个剧本“方珍珠”演出的时候，把旧日的经历一一回想起来。（报）
    （十一）这些问题，当我们到了在五天里打死十七个恶霸地主的青浦县，我们所了解的实际情况是这样的……（期）
    （十二）所谓大打，那就是指全世界范围内的打和长期的打，但这两种情况，显然不利的是美帝国主义而不是我们。（期）
    （十三）也有些厂矿，随便更改定额与计划，使工人感到，这种拧螺丝政策，费多大劲也达不到行政上的要求。（稿）（十）应该说“这种种……使我把……”。（“看了”的“了”字不妥，要去掉。）（十一）应该说“关于这些问题”。（十二）应该说“这两种情况显然是不利于美帝国主义而不是不利于我们”。
    （十三）应该说“这是一种拧螺丝政策”。
    另一种游离成分是这样的：
    （十四）一般人的看法，今年的雨水不会太多。
    （十五）蒙古过去的传统习惯，在草地里引起火
    灾的要处死刑。（期）这里的含义是“依照一般人的看法”“根据蒙古的传统习惯”（“过去”可省）；也可以说是“一般人的看法是”“蒙古的传统习惯是”。底下这三句是类似这种格式而不应该采取这种格式的。
    （十六）二十余天的工作，我收获了不少。（报）
    （十七）今年五月间的生产立功运动，涌现了大量的劳动模范。（期）
    （十八）革大在自我改造这一件事情上对我的帮助，我想小组生活占着很重要的部分。（报）（十六）和（十七）都应该加“在”……“中”。（十八）应该在头上加“讲到”。或是在“很重要的部分”之前加“其中”，让句子头上的游离成分成为外位语。（“占着”的“着”是多余的，“占”和“部分”也不相应，要就是“占………地位”，要就是“是……部分”。
    游离的主谓短语。主谓短语在古代可以当一个分句用，如：“大道之行也，天下为公。”可是我们知道，现代语里的主谓短语，与其说是古代格式的复活，毋宁说是外国语法的输入。一般的情形是只用它做主语、宾语、表语，不大用来代替复合句里的分句。因此，下面这三句里的主谓短语使人觉得脱离组织，无着落。
    （十九）法国在越南战争的惨败，它唯一急迫的要求是希望美帝来救急，而不是其他。（期）
    （二十）但是民族情况的复杂，加上了时间的短促，这次工作只能说是学习的开端。（期）
    （二一）参考资料的搜集，不论是征求或订购而来的，要想得到较好的收获，必须对于资料采访要首先踏实的下一番工夫。（期）（十九）可改为“法国在越南惨败”。（二十）可改为“但是因为民族情况复杂，加上时间短促”。（二一）可改为“搜集参考资料”。这一句还有别的毛病，底下应改为“无论是用征求的方式还是用订购的方式，要想得到较好的收获，必须首先对于资料的采访着着实实地下一番的工夫”。底下这一句似乎勉强可以。
    （二二）评论工作的贫弱，一般的解释是缺乏有修养的写作干部。（报）但是不如改为“评论工作之所以贫弱”，这是从文言继承过来而现代还通用的用短语代分句的格式。非游离成分。有一种格式，看上去像是游离成分，其实不是。例如：
    （二三）每一个煤井和通道，支撑的柱子全是钢骨水泥的。（报）
    （二四）马恒昌先进生产小组，经过长久的政治和文化学习，阶级觉悟提高了。（期）（二三）的“每一个煤井和通道”是句子的主语，谓语是一个句子形式。（二四）也是同样的，只是谓语有两个部分，其中第二个是一个句子形式。（参阅第一讲第四段三八、三九、四十例。）底下是两个似是而非的例子。
    （二五）解放后的井冈山，在人民政权领导之下，一切恢复和建设工作都已大力展开。（期）
    （二六）上海戏曲界，正是“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”，无限光明的前途展开在眼前。（期）
    （二五）应该在头上加个“在”字，或是改做“解放后，在人民政权领导之下，井冈山的一切………”。（二六）应该在“眼前”之前加“它的”，用来和“上海戏曲界”联系，使它成为外位语。
    外位成分、游离成分、句子形式作谓语，这些都是我们语言里固有的活泼生动的格式，但是使用起来要非常当心。一不小心就会有一些词语变成无组织，无着落。用得恰当不恰当，相差往往只在几微之间。没有把握的时候，宁可采取组织比较更明显的句法。（本段完，全文未完）
