    Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: Chairman of the Hiroshima Peace Conference in Hiroshima, Kakuta Hideo, issued an "Appeal from Hiroshima," opposing the San Francisco Conference which threatens peace, and demanding the convocation of a comprehensive peace conference. The full text of the appeal is as follows:
    --Responding to the wishes of the 200,000 dead who sleep in Hiroshima, under the oppression and interference of the enemies of peace--
    The current rulers of Japan are preparing to participate in the San Francisco Conference, which attempts to rearm Japan, to conclude military treaties, and to permanently deliver Japan into the hands of foreign troops.
    If we permit this to happen, world peace will be threatened, and Japan will encounter a permanently shameful history.
    We, the peace defenders from all over Japan who came to Hiroshima on the anniversary of the atomic bombing, do not want the tragedy of Hiroshima to repeat itself. We appeal to all people who demand lasting peace and national independence:
    Oppose the San Francisco Conference that is about to threaten peace and lead to the demise of our nation!
    Demand the immediate convocation of a peace conference including all countries, based on the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China.

            Chairman of the Hiroshima Peace Conference, Kakuta Hideo, August 6, 1951

    广岛和平会议主席
    发出“来自广岛的呼吁”
    不希望广岛悲剧重演，要求持久和平与民族独立
    【新华社九日讯】日本广岛和平会议主席加久田秀雄发出“来自广岛的呼吁”，反对威胁和平的旧金山会议，要求召开全面和平会议。呼吁书全文如下：——响应在和平敌人的压迫和干涉之下，在广岛长眠的二十万死者的愿望——
    目前日本的统治者正在准备参加企图重新武装日本的旧金山会议，以缔结军事条约以及将日本永久断送在外国军队的手里。
    假如我们对此加以容许，世界和平将受到威胁，日本将遇到永久可耻的历史。
    我们，于原子弹日前来广岛的全日本和平保卫者，不希望广岛悲剧重演，我们呼吁要求持久和平与民族独立的全体人民，——
    反对行将威胁和平并导致我们民族灭亡的旧金山会议！
    要求立即召开在美、苏、英、中外长会议基础上，包括各个国家在内的和平会议。
            广岛和平会议主席加久田秀雄  于一九五一年八月六日
