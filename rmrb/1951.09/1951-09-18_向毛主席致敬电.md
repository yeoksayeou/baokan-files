Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

We are now reporting to you that the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee has been officially established today. After four months of arduous struggle, we have achieved today's victory. Our fellow Catholics have generally raised their political awareness, distinguished between friend and foe, resolutely severed relations with imperialism, and implemented self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. On August 30th, we signed and issued a declaration demanding that the government expel the imperialist element, Archbishop Riberi. The overwhelming majority of Catholics in the city signed, demonstrating the determination and enthusiasm of Beijing's Catholics to resist imperialism, love the country, and love the Church. This movement has won the support of all Catholics. We now assure you that we have the confidence to do a good job in resisting imperialism, loving the country, and loving the Church. We are determined to sever all ties with imperialism, eliminate imperialist influence, respond to all calls from the People's Government at any time, and stand with the people of the whole country to accomplish the great task of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country with practical actions. Now, we hereby report to you on behalf of all Catholics in Beijing, and wish you good health.

With the highest respect!

The Inaugural Assembly of the Chinese Catholic Beijing Reform Committee

September 17, 1951
