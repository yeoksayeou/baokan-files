Ridgway's Reply of the Seventeenth

To Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    I have received your letter of September 12th. Every accusation contained in your letter has been thoroughly investigated. These investigations have confirmed that the United Nations Command has not, I repeat, has not been involved in any incidents of violating the neutral zone, except for the one incident that occurred on September 10th. The results of these thorough investigations have been previously communicated to your side, demonstrating the objective and responsible attitude of the United Nations Command towards violations of the neutral zone agreement. You indicate in your letter a desire to resume negotiations, and I must remind you that the negotiations were suspended by your order since August 23rd. I reiterate my concern for reaching a just and honorable military armistice. If you now intend to terminate your suspension of the armistice negotiations as announced on August 23rd, I remain prepared to order my liaison officers to meet on the bridge at Panmunjom to discuss mutually satisfactory conditions for resuming armistice negotiations.

    General of the Army, United States of America, Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, Matthew B. Ridgway
            September 17, 1951

    李奇微十七日的覆信朝鲜人民军金日成最高司令官中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员：
    你们九月十二日的来信收到了。你们信中包含的每一个指控，都已经过彻底调查。这些已证实联合国军并未，我重复并未，牵涉于任何破坏中立区的事件，只除了九月十日所发生的那一事件。这些彻底调查的结果，前此都已通知你方，它表示出联合国军对于中立区协议的破坏所持的客观与负责的态度。你们在来信中提示着恢复谈判的愿望，我必须提醒你们，谈判是由你方下令而自八月二十三日起中止的。我再次强调我对于一个公正而光荣的军事停战的达成的关心。假如你们现在有意终止你方在八月二十三日所宣布的停战谈判的中止，我依然准备命令我的联络官到板门店的桥上会晤讨论可使双方满意的恢复停战谈判的条件。
    美国陆军上将联合国军总司令李奇微
            一九五一年九月十七日
