Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 26th -- The Australian people, in the referendum held on the 22nd, have victoriously crushed the reactionary Menzies government's plot to outlaw the Communist Party and deprive the people of their democratic rights. Of the more than four million citizens who participated in the vote, the majority expressed opposition to the Menzies government's arrogant demand for authorization to amend the constitution to declare the Communist Party illegal. The Menzies government originally intended to use this to fabricate public opinion and implement fascist legislation to attack the Communist Party of Australia, various democratic organizations, and all peace-loving people. However, the results of the vote show that the Menzies government, in its anti-communist vote which it orchestrated, failed to obtain either a majority of the total votes or a majority of the votes in most states of the country. It suffered a complete and utter defeat in the two conditions necessary for it to enact anti-communist legislation.

The victory of the Australian people in this referendum not only makes it impossible for the Menzies government's fascist plans to be realized, but is also tantamount to a vote of no confidence in it, and politically discredits it. Therefore, according to the Associated Press, the Australian reactionaries "felt very frustrated" by the failure suffered in the referendum. At the same time, according to Reuters, Menzies himself had to admit that in the face of the strong will of the Australian people to defend democratic freedom, he could no longer blatantly promote fascist policies, and he sadly stated: "As the outcome of the vote shows, I will have one hand tied behind my back to fight the Communist Party."

The Communist Party of Australia issued a statement, pointing out the great significance of this vote: the failure of the Menzies government in the anti-communist referendum is a powerful blow to the Australian reactionaries and the United States' war plans in the Pacific. Dixon, Chairman of the CPA, said: "The vote cast by the Australian people is a vote to safeguard freedom and peace. This vote will strengthen the Australian people's struggle for peace and democracy."

The Communist Party of Great Britain, in a statement issued on the evening of the 22nd, pointed out: "The defeat of the anti-communist referendum by the Australian people is an important victory in the struggle for democracy and a warning to reactionaries everywhere." The statement said: "Despite the flood of anti-communist slander and vilification, the fact that the people rejected Menzies' fascist proposals is a setback for Menzies' war policy. ... All peace-loving and democratic people around the world will draw courage and inspiration from this victory."

    澳大利亚人民在公民投票中
    击败孟席斯政府反共阴谋
    澳共赢得广大人民拥护
     【新华社二十六日讯】悉尼消息：澳大利亚人民在二十二日举行的公民投票中，已胜利地粉碎了孟席斯反动政府企图取缔共产党和剥夺人民的民主权利的阴谋。在全体四百多万参加投票的公民中，大多数表示反对孟席斯政府要求授权它修改宪法以宣布共产党为非法的狂妄要求。孟席斯政府原想借此假造民意，实行法西斯立法，以打击澳大利亚的共产党、各民主组织和一切爱好和平的人民，但是，投票的结果表明：孟席斯政府在它一手策划的反共投票中，既未能获得总票数的大多数，又未能在全国大多数州中获得多数票，在它为制定反共立法所必需的两个条件上都遭到了完全的惨败。
    澳大利亚人民在这次公民投票中的胜利，不仅使孟席斯政府的法西斯计划无法实现，而且等于对它投了一次不信任票，而使它在政治上威信扫地。因此，据合众社透露：澳大利亚反动派对于公民投票中遭受的失败“感到非常沮丧”。同时，据路透社透露，孟席斯自己也不得不承认，在澳大利亚人民保卫民主自由的强大意志面前，他已无法明目张胆地推行法西斯政策，他悲哀地表示：“就投票的结果看来，我将要有一只手被缚在背后来与共产党进行斗争。”
    澳大利亚共产党发表声明，指出这次投票的重大意义说：孟席斯政府在反共的公民投票中所遭到的失败，对于澳大利亚反动派和美国在太平洋的战争计划是一个有力的打击。澳共主席狄克逊说：“澳大利亚人民所投的票，是维护自由与和平的票。这次投票将加强澳大利亚人民争取和平与民主的斗争。”
    英国共产党在二十二日晚发表的声明中指出：“澳大利亚人民击败反共的全民投票，是争取民主的斗争中一个重要的胜利，同时也是对各处反动派的一个警告。”声明说：“尽管反共毁谤和污蔑多得像洪水一样，人民还是拒绝了孟席斯的法西斯建议，这一事实是孟席斯战争政策的挫败。……全世界爱好和平与民主的人们都将从这个胜利中得到勇气和鼓舞。”
