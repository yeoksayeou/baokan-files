How to Sing Two Songs for National Day
Sun Shen

The first song, "Ode to the Motherland," has already been sung in parades by workers and students in the North China region. The melody is smooth and bright, making it a relatively good song for promoting patriotism. The entire song expresses boundless pride and enthusiasm, singing of our beautiful and great motherland, brave and hardworking people, and the happy and wonderful new society. The whole song is divided into two sections: before the 28th measure is the first section; from the 29th measure to the repeat sign (:‖) is the second section. The first section should be full of fervent and joyous emotions, and the second section should be sung cheerfully and lively, without changing the tempo before and after. The overall rhythm is strong and must be carefully grasped.

The second song, "People of the World Are of One Heart," won second prize in the song competition at the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival. This song vividly expresses the new, revolutionary optimistic feelings of the Chinese people and their confidence in defending world peace. The melody has a distinct national style and has become widely popular in China, proving that it is loved by the masses. When singing, the tempo should be slightly faster, and the whole song should have momentum. The lyrics "Mao Zedong, Stalin" in the ninth and tenth measures should convey a feeling of jubilation; in the eleventh and twelfth measures, they should be sung with affection. The lyrics "Strive for people's democracy, strive for lasting peace, people of the world are of one heart!" are the core of the whole song and should be emphasized when singing. The word "照" [zhào, shine] in the 20th measure was originally one beat, but has now been changed to two beats for ease of singing during parades. (Image attached)

    国庆节唱的两首歌曲的唱法
    孙慎
    第一首歌——《歌唱祖国》，已在华北地区的工人和学生中间游行。曲调流畅、嘹亮，是宣扬爱国精神的歌曲中较好的一首。全曲展现着无限的骄傲和热情，歌唱我们美丽、伟大的祖国，勇敢勤劳的人民和幸福美好的新社会。全曲分两段：第二十八小节以前是第一段；自第二十九小节到反复记号（：‖）处是第二段。第一段要充满热烈、欢腾的情绪，第二段要唱得愉快，活泼，前后速度不要变换。整个节奏是强烈的，须注意把握。
    第二首歌——“全世界人民心一条”，已在第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节歌曲竞赛中荣获二等奖。这首歌生动地表现了中国人民新的、革命乐观主义的感情和保卫世界和平的信心，曲调具有鲜明的民族风格，并已在国内广泛流行，证明是群众所喜爱的。唱时速度要稍快，全曲须有气势。歌词“毛泽东，斯大林”一句，在九、十小节上是欢呼的感情；在十一、十二小节上要唱得亲切。歌词“争取人民民主，争取持久和平，全世界人民心一条！”是全曲的中心所在，唱时要突出。第二十小节的“照”字处，原为一拍，为便于游行时唱，现改为两拍。（附图片）
