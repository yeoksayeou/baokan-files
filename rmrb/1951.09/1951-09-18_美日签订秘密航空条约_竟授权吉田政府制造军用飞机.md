Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington, 14th: Reliable sources here say that Japan is about to open two international air routes: Tokyo-San Francisco and Tokyo-Indonesia-Karachi. It is understood that the opening of these routes will be based on a secret treaty concluded between the US State Department and the Japanese Yoshida government before the signing of the "peace treaty" with Japan in San Francisco on September 8.

Some of the largest American airlines, especially "Air Transport Company," are participating in organizing the Japanese air routes and providing funding.

The secret clauses of the treaty authorize the Japanese government to produce military aircraft, especially bombers, in factories that ostensibly manufacture civilian aircraft. The reason why the United States allows Japan to build huge "Constellation" passenger planes is here. This production can easily be used as a smokescreen to cover the production of "Flying Fortress" bombers.

The factories of Japan's largest aircraft manufacturer, "Kawanishi Aircraft Company," together with American aircraft manufacturers, have already begun producing passenger and military aircraft.

It is reported that because of fear of strong protests from Australia and Asian countries against the aviation treaty, the State Department insisted that the news of Japan's first international airline should only be made public after the San Francisco conference was over.

    美日签订秘密航空条约
    竟授权吉田政府制造军用飞机
    【新华社讯】电通社华盛顿十四日讯：此间可靠人士说：日本行将开辟东京——旧金山和东京——印尼——喀喇蚩这两条国际航空线。据悉，这些航路的开辟将是根据一项秘密条约，这个秘密条约在九月八日旧金山签署对日“和约”以前美国国务院与日本吉田政府之间就缔结了。
    参加组织日本航线并供给经费的有最大的美国航空公司，特别是“航空运输公司”。
    该条约的秘密条款，授权日本政府在表面上规定制造民用飞机的工厂生产军用飞机，特别是轰炸机。美国之所以准许日本建造庞大的“星座”式客机，其原因就在这里。这种生产很容易作为烟幕来掩盖“飞行堡垒”式轰炸机的生产。
    日本最大的飞机制造公司“川西航空机制作所”的各厂，会同美国飞机制造公司，都已经在开始生产客机与军用机了。
    据悉，因为害怕澳大利亚与亚洲国家激烈抗议航空条约，所以国务院坚主只有在旧金山会议开会完毕以后，才能把日本的第一个国际航空公司的消息公诸于世。
