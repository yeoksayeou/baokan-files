Brief Commentary on Party Life

    Correct Work Attitude
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his article "On the Self-Cultivation of a Communist Party Member": Communist Party members should be "in their ideology, only have the interests and goals of the Party and Communism, and no individual goals and private plans independent of the Party." "Do not compare with others in terms of enjoyment, but compare with others in terms of the amount of revolutionary work and arduous struggle." Luo Yunzhang's revolutionary deeds demonstrate this noble quality of a Communist Party member. He said: "Nothing is more distressing than not having work, only work is happiness." This is the attitude towards revolution that a Communist Party member should have.
    Within the revolutionary ranks, there are indeed some others who, in contrast to Luo Yunzhang, always like to put personal interests ahead of the Party's interests, hesitating and weighing gains and losses. If these comrades do not correct their faults, they will never be able to do a good job for the Party and the people. We should learn from Luo Yunzhang's attitude towards revolutionary work, eliminate all non-proletarian thoughts, and strive for a higher standard for Party members.
    We Must Pay Attention to Labor Protection in Small Factories
    The serious neglect of labor protection in factories and enterprises with fewer than 100 employees in some cities is a widespread issue that deserves attention. According to statistics from the Shanghai Labor Bureau, in the first eight months of this year, more than 3,000 workers in small factories in the city were injured or killed in work-related accidents (more than 70 deaths, 2,941 minor and major injuries). Casualties are most common in cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, machinery, electrical machinery, smelting, papermaking, dyes, and municipal industries, with the most serious problems being in papermaking and dye industries. Among the three thousand accidents, except for seven cases of irresistible disasters, all were accidents caused by negligence. Some were injured or killed due to the lack of protective equipment and safety systems; some were injured or killed due to poor equipment and equipment that had not been repaired for a long time; some were injured or killed due to inadequate inspection and inspection systems that were mere formalities; some were injured or killed due to the lack of sound production management systems and insufficient technical safety education; some were injured or killed due to excessive working hours and improper operation. Many workers in the chemical industry, such as paper mills and enamel factories, suffer from lung diseases. Some factories do not even have basic sanitary facilities, and it is difficult for workers to relieve themselves. Many small factory workers do not even have a place to sleep. Workers at the Dahua Printing Factory sleep on piles of paper, on the ground, and on machines at night, and apprentices even sleep in garbage heaps next to the toilet. Therefore, many small factory workers have complained: "The big factories have turned over, but our small factories have not yet turned over."
    The Party organizations in the areas where these factories are located should pay serious attention to the above situations. Party organizations must earnestly give workers the greatest care in their lives, and must never ignore the workers' basic legitimate interests. According to the Common Program, they must resolutely support the workers in their struggle for their due rights.

    党的生活简评
    正确的工作态度
    刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”一文中指出：共产党员应该是：“思想意识中，只有党的、共产主义的利益和目的，没有自己离党而独立的个人目的和私人打算”。“不与别人计较享受的优劣，而与别人计较革命工作的多少和艰苦奋斗”。罗云章的革命事迹表现了共产党员这一崇高的品质。他说：“没有工作最使人苦恼，只有工作才是快乐”，这是共产党员应当具有的对革命的态度。
    在革命队伍内，确实有另外一些人，他们同罗云章相反，考虑问题总是喜欢把个人利益放在党的利益前面，瞻前顾后，计较得失。这些同志如果不改正自己的毛病，是永远不会也不可能给党和人民作好工作的。我们应当学习罗云章对革命工作的态度，肃清一切非无产阶级的思想，为党员的更高标准而斗争。
    必须重视小型工厂的劳动保护
    若干城市中百人以下的工厂企业中，存在着严重的忽视劳动保护现象，这是一个普遍值得注意的问题。据上海劳动局统计：今年八个月中，该市小型工厂职工因工伤亡达三千多人（死七十多人、轻重伤二九四一人）。伤亡事故以棉纺、染织、机器、电机、冶炼、造纸、染料、市政等最多，问题最严重的是造纸、染料等工业。在三千多件事故中，除七件为不可抗拒的灾害外，都是责任事故。有的因无防护设备、无安全制度而伤亡的；有的因设备不良和设备年久失修而伤亡的；有的因检查不周和检查制度流于形式而致伤亡的；有的因没有健全的生产管理制度、技术安全教育不够而伤亡的；有的因工作时间过长和操作法不当而伤亡的等。化学工业中的造纸厂和搪瓷厂，工人得肺病的很多。有些工厂连起码的卫生设备也没有，工人大小便都成问题。许多小厂工人甚至没有地方睡觉，大华印刷厂的工人，晚上就睡在纸堆上、地上、机器上，学徒竟睡在厕所旁边的垃圾堆里。因此，有许多小厂的工人们就反应：“大厂翻身了，我们小厂还未翻身”。
    以上这些情况值得各个工厂所在地区党组织严重注意。党的组织要切实地给工人生活以最大的关怀，绝对不能漠视工人起码的合法的利益，要根据共同纲领坚决地支持工人为他们应得的权利而进行斗争。
