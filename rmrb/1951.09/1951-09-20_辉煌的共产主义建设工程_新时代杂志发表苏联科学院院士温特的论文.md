Glorious Communist Construction Projects
*New Era* Magazine Publishes Article by Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Winter

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The latest issue, number 34, of *New Era* magazine published an article by Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Winter entitled "Glorious Communist Construction Projects," detailing the great significance of the Soviet Union's construction of huge hydroelectric power stations on the Volga, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers, as well as the excavation of canals and irrigation ditches in Turkmenistan, Southern Ukraine, and Northern Crimea, for the further development of the Soviet Communist construction cause and the national economy.

Winter described the development of electrical engineering in the Soviet Union since the October Revolution, saying: The young Soviet state inherited a very backward power industry from Tsarist Russia. The total generating capacity of Russian power stations slightly exceeded one million kilowatts, with an annual electricity generation of 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours, ranking fifteenth among electricity-producing countries in the world. After the end of the civil war in 1920, the power generation of all power stations operating in the Soviet Union had dropped to 500 million kilowatt-hours. The national electrification plan formulated in 1920 stipulated the construction of 30 new power stations with a total generating capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts within ten or fifteen years. In this way, the total national electricity generation would increase to 8.8 billion kilowatt-hours. This plan was overfulfilled by 1932. Today, the development of electricity production has exceeded the planned target by fifteen times! The Soviet Union ranks first in Europe and second in the world in electricity production, and its rate of development exceeds that of all capitalist countries! The Soviet Union's annual electricity generation is now nearly 100 billion kilowatt-hours, equivalent to 200 times that of 1920.

Winter continued: The water conservancy projects undertaken by the Soviet Union last year mark a new stage in accomplishing the historical task of laying the material and technical foundation for communist society. The scale of these water conservancy projects is exceptionally large. The total generating capacity of the hydroelectric power stations to be completed in the next five or six years will be 4.22 million kilowatts, equivalent to four times the total generating capacity of the existing hydroelectric power stations in South American countries. The generating capacity of the world's largest hydroelectric power stations—the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations—both exceed the generating capacity of the largest hydroelectric power stations in the United States—the Grand Coulee Dam or the Boulder Dam. The generating capacity of each of the new Soviet hydroelectric power stations also exceeds the total generating capacity of the other 20 hydroelectric power stations in the United States, which were built by the United States over several decades. The annual electricity generation of the new Soviet hydroelectric power stations is more than 22 billion kilowatt-hours, equal to the total electricity generation of all power stations in Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain, equivalent to 20 times the electricity generation of all hydroelectric power stations in the United Kingdom, one and a half times more than France, and greater than the electricity generation of all power stations in Italy.

Winter pointed out: 22 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity is of great importance to the Soviet national economy. The Volga River will become one of the world's largest waterways. Currently, the industrial output of the Volga River basin accounts for about 50 percent of the country's total industrial output, with 65 million hectares of arable land and 67 million hectares of forests, and more than 1,500 wharves. After the completion of the new hydroelectric power stations, cheap electricity will enable factories along the river to carry out mass production at low cost and facilitate the transportation of goods to all parts of the country. The hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River will stimulate the industrial development of the regions adjacent to the Volga River basin and will become the base for large-scale electrification of Moscow, the Central Black Earth Region, and other more remote regions. They will meet the electricity needs of electrometallurgical and electrochemical industries and facilitate the further development of synthetic rubber, artificial fiber, plastics, paints, dyes, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and other industries.

Huge industries will be established to process agricultural products produced from 28 million hectares of newly irrigated land. This land is larger than the combined area of the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark. It is equivalent to nine times the total irrigated land in the Nile River basin, which has been developed for thousands of years, and equal to three and a half times the land area developed by the United States over hundreds of years. On these newly irrigated lands, the wheat harvest is much larger than that of Canada (Canada's wheat harvest does not exceed 110 million quintals annually), and much larger than the wheat production of France, Italy, Argentina, and Spain. The harvest of other crops is also very large, because these areas have 300 days of sunshine and no frost each year, and some crops can be harvested twice or more each year. The development conditions for livestock and poultry breeding are particularly good. The wheat, rye, rice and other grains, vegetables, fruits, meat, and dairy products produced in these areas are enough to feed 100 million people.

The new power stations will enable widespread electrification of agriculture. In the vast irrigated fields, there will be tractors and combine harvesters powered by electricity. Electricity will be used freely in agriculture. The new hydroelectric power stations will solve many problems related to waterway transportation, and the work of connecting Moscow and the seas of the European part of the Soviet Union by water will be completed. The oil and fish of the Caspian Sea, the coal of the Donbass, the timber of the North, the metal and machinery of the Urals, and the grain of the Volga River basin will be transported to all parts of the country by a single waterway system. In the areas adjacent to hydroelectric power stations and transmission lines, electrified railway lines with huge transportation capacity will be built. The new power stations will further improve working conditions, facilitate urban construction, enable widespread use of electricity in every household, and in short, make the lives of the Soviet people more comfortable. The peaceful orientation of Soviet economic development stands in sharp contrast to the militaristic spirit that characterizes capitalist countries' economies.

Winter then discussed the development prospects of Soviet power engineering, pointing out that electricity will be the main factor in future power resources. Stalin's communist construction plan for the next fifteen years requires no less than 250 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is 500 times the electricity generation at the beginning of the implementation of the All-Russian Electrification Plan. However, the Soviet Union is a country with unlimited power resources. The Soviet Union has a total of 108,500 rivers. It is estimated that building power stations on 1,500 rivers could achieve a total generating capacity of 300 million kilowatts, with an annual electricity generation of more than 2.7 trillion kilowatt-hours. The Soviet Union's water resources are almost four times that of the United States and seven times that of Canada. The Soviet Union also ranks first in the world in power resources such as coal, oil, peat, and timber. The Soviet system and high level of technology guarantee exceptionally rapid progress in the widespread utilization of these abundant power sources.

The further electrification of the Soviet national economy makes it necessary to further develop automatic control and electrical control. Some power stations are now automated to the point that they do not need on-site staff at all and are completely controlled from remote locations. In the future, linking all power plants in the Soviet Union into a single grid will enable centralized control of national power generation and electricity distribution. In communist society, a person will control vast power resources like a magician and manage automatically operating factories.

Winter emphasized that the great communist construction projects to be completed in the next five years will lay the foundation for even greater communist construction projects. Soviet scientists are developing even larger-scale plans. One of the most fascinating tasks is to seize vast lands that are currently useless from nature. One-seventh of the Soviet Union's territory is still desert or semi-desert. Scientists are studying how to introduce large amounts of river water into desert areas and turn them into fertile fields. An even more lofty task is to eliminate perennial ice封状况 in more than one-third of the country's territory, change the climate, establish modern cities, and build industries, farms, and railways. The rapid development of Soviet power resources will enable us to build mechanical factories that seem like fantasies today.

At the same time, atomic energy will play a significant role in future mechanical engineering. It will not only be used in huge mechanical engineering projects or to build canals and dams, but also to produce cheap electricity, which will have a beneficial impact on all sectors of the Soviet economy and further reduce the heavy physical labor of the people in urban and rural areas.

Winter concluded: When the difference between mental and physical labor is gradually eliminated and all the people of the country are able to dedicate themselves to highly creative activities, the Soviet Union will unfold new and infinitely beautiful prospects. Now, all the people of the Soviet Union are contributing their strength to the great communist construction projects with unparalleled enthusiasm.

    辉煌的共产主义建设工程
    新时代杂志发表苏联科学院院士温特的论文
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：据塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近出版的第三十四期新时代杂志发表了苏联科学院院士温特的题为“辉煌的共产主义建设工程”一文，详细论述苏联在伏尔加河、第聂伯河及阿姆河畔建造巨大的水电站，以及在土库曼、南乌克兰和北克里米亚等地开凿运河及灌溉水渠，对苏联共产主义建设事业和国民经济进一步发展的重大意义。
    温特叙述了苏联十月革命以来电力工程的发展情况，他说：年青的苏维埃国家从沙皇俄国接收过来的动力工业是非常落后的。俄国电力站的总发电能力稍稍超过一百万瓩，每年发电量十六亿瓩时，在全世界生产电力的国家中占第十五位。一九二○年内战结束后苏联全国一切开工的电力站的发电量，曾经降低到五亿瓩时。一九二○年制定的全国电气化计划，规定在十年或十五年内建设三十座新电力站，总发电能力为一百五十万瓩。这样，全国总发电量将增加到八十八亿瓩时。到一九三二年这个计划便超额完成了。到了今天，电力生产的发展已超过了计划规定的目标十五倍，苏联在电力生产方面已占居欧洲第一位和世界第二位，在发展的速率上超过了一切资本主义国家！苏联每年的发电量已将近一千亿瓩时，相当于一九二○年的二百倍。
    温特接着说：苏联去年着手进行的水利工程，在完成奠立共产主义社会的物质与技术基础这个历史任务中，标志出一个新的阶段。这些水利工程的规模是异常庞大的。将在今后五、六年内落成的水电站，总发电能力为四百二十二万瓩，相当于南美洲各国现有水电站总发电能力的四倍。世界上最大的水电站——古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站的发电能力，都超过美国最大的水电站——大河床水闸或鲍尔德水闸的发电能力。苏联各个新的水电站的发电能力也超过美国其他二十座水电站的总发电能力，而这些电站是美国在几十年内建立起来的。苏联的新水电站每年的发电量在二百二十亿瓩时以上，等于丹麦、芬兰、荷兰、比利时和西班牙的全部电力站的总发电量，相当于英国一切水电站的发电量的二十倍，比法国多一倍半，也大于意大利一切电力站的发电量。
    温特指出：二百二十亿瓩时的电力，对于苏联国民经济具有巨大的重要性。伏尔加河将成为世界上最大的水道之一。现在，伏尔加河流域的工业产量约占全国工业总产量的百分之五十，它有六千五百万公顷的可耕地和六千七百万公顷的森林，有一千五百多个码头，新的水电站落成后，低廉的电力将使沿河一带的工厂以低廉的成本进行大量生产，并便于把货物运往全国各地。伏尔加河畔的水电站将刺激伏尔加河流域相邻的区域的工业的发展，并且将成为莫斯科、中央黑土地带及其他更遥远区域的大规模电气化的基地。它们将满足电力冶金和电力化学工业所需要的电力，并便利于人造橡胶、人造纤维、塑胶、油漆、染料、肥料、制药及其他工业的进一步发展。
    庞大的工业将建立起来，替二千八百万公顷的新灌溉土地所出产的农产品加工。这片土地比英国、比利时、荷兰、瑞士和丹麦加在一起还要大，它相当于已经发展了几千年的尼罗河流域全部灌溉土地的九倍，等于美国发展了几百年的土地面积的三倍半。在这些新灌溉土地上，小麦的收成比加拿大的要大得多（加拿大的小麦收成每年不超过一亿一千万生丁纳），比法国、意大利、阿根廷、西班牙的小麦产量都要大得多。其他农作物的收成也很大，因为这些地区每年有三百天是有太阳和没有霜雪的日子，若干农作物每年可以收割两次或两次以上。牲畜和家禽饲养事业的发展条件特别好。这些地区生产的小麦、裸麦、大米和其他谷物、菜蔬、水果、肉类和牛奶制品，足够供养一亿人民。
    新的电力站将使农业广泛电气化。在广阔的灌溉田野上，将出现由电力推动的拖拉机和收割联合机。农业上将自由地使用电力。新的水电站将解决许多关于水道运输的问题，由水路把莫斯科和苏联欧洲部分各海接连起来的工作将要完成。里海的油和鱼、顿巴斯的煤、北方的木材、乌拉尔的金属和机器、伏尔加河流域的五谷，将由单一的水道系统运到各地。在毗连水电站和输电线的地区，将建造有巨大运输能力的电气化铁路线。新的电力站将进一步改善工作条件，便利于城市建设，使家家户户能够广泛使用电力，总之将使苏联人民的生活更加舒适。苏联经济发展的和平倾向和作为资本主义国家经济特征的军国主义精神恰成相反的对照。
    温特接着论述苏联动力工程的发展前途，他指出：电力将是未来动力资源的主要因素，斯大林为今后十五年规划的共产主义建设计划，就需要不下于二千五百亿瓩时的电力，这是开始实行全俄电气化计划时期发电量的五百倍。但是，苏联是有着无限动力资源的国家。苏联共有十万八千五百条河流，据估计在一千五百条河流上建设电力站，总发电能力就可以达到三亿瓩，每年发电量可以达到两万七千多亿瓩时。苏联水力资源差不多是美国的四倍和加拿大的七倍。在煤、石油、泥炭、木材等动力资源上，苏联也占居世界的首位。苏维埃制度和高度的技术水平，保证在广泛利用这些丰富的动力来源上能够有异常迅速的进步。
    苏联国民经济的进一步电气化，使得自动控制和电力控制的进一步发展成为必要，现在，有些电力站已经自动化到了这种地步，它们根本不需要现场工作人员，完全从遥远的地方加以控制。将来把苏联一切电力厂联结成一个单一的网，将能集中控制全国发电并分配电力。在共产主义社会中，一个人将像魔术师一般，控制着庞大的动力资源，管理着自动开工的工厂。
    温特强调说：在最近五年内完成的伟大的共产主义建设工程，将为未来更伟大的共产主义建设工程奠定基础。苏联科学家正在制订规模更为庞大的计划。使人心醉的任务之一是把目前无用的广大土地从大自然中夺取过来。苏联有七分之一的领土仍旧是沙漠或半沙漠地带，科学家正在研究把大量的河水引入沙漠地带，把它们变成肥沃的田地。更崇高的任务是在国内三分之一以上的领土内消除常年的冰封状况，改变气候，建立现代化的城市，建设工业、农场和铁路。苏联动力资源的迅速发展将使我们能够建立在今天看来是空想的机械工厂。
    同时，原子能在未来的机械工程上将起着重大的作用。它将不但使用在庞大的机械工程上面，或建造运河和水闸，而且要用来生产廉价的电力，这些电力将使苏联各经济部门受到有利的影响，进一步减轻城乡人民笨重的体力劳动。
    温特结语说：当脑力劳动和体力劳动的差异逐渐消灭，全国人民都能够献身于高度创造性的活动时，苏联将展开新的无限美好的远景。现在，苏联全体人民都以无比的热情，为伟大共产主义建设工程贡献他们的力量。
