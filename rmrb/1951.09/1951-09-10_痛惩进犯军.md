	Severely Punishing the Invading Army
	Xiong Long, Ye Lin
	During the armistice negotiations, the American invading army, which constantly provoked attacks, suffered heavy casualties from the People's Army of Korea and China, which was waiting in full battle array.

	The reporters visited a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed in the northeast area of ​​Kimhwa. In the latter half of July, the enemy poured more than 20,000 shells and hundreds of bombs and incendiary bombs on this line of defense, and launched 18 attacks with a platoon to a battalion of troops on the forward small hill positions of this unit, which had only a few troops. However, the unit still held the original position of half a month ago, the only difference being that the dirty blood of the invading army soaked the soil in front of the position. In the fighting at the forward positions alone, the outpost units of this unit killed or wounded more than 500 enemies, and shot down or damaged four enemy planes. Only after our army completed the task of annihilating the enemy did it voluntarily withdraw from some small hills.

	The volunteer soldiers were determined to teach the adventurous bandits who invaded with severe blows. A certain squad, stationed on the forefront of a small hill on the 602.2 high ground, with the cooperation of friendly neighboring units, successively defeated many attacks by a U.S. military company to a battalion, killing or wounding more than 210 enemies in two days, creating a glorious example of annihilating a large number of enemies with a small number of troops. In the fierce battle on the first day, they killed or wounded more than 70 enemies with grenades and rifles, and defeated five fierce attacks by an enemy company. At night, the squad, disregarding fatigue, strengthened its fortifications to prepare for the battle on the second day. At dawn the next day, these strong fortifications withstood the bombardment of more than a thousand enemy shells. Then the soldiers confronted the attack of a battalion of enemy troops. After the enemy's second attack was defeated, the enemy became angry and reorganized its forces, launching another attack under the cover of various artillery fire. At this time, the squad had been reduced from the original nine people to three people. Under the calm command of squad leader Li Hongkui, the three of them each guarded a main direction, throwing rows of grenades into the enemy crowd, which was only more than 20 meters away. The machine gun shooter Cong Ruqi, who had previously shot down an enemy plane with thirteen bullets and was awarded the title of Special Class Hero on the spot, held his machine gun and fired fiercely. When the machine gun malfunctioned, he picked up grenades and fought alongside the infantry until his abdomen was injured and blood soaked his clothes. He kept throwing grenades. With the cooperation of friendly neighboring units, they finally repelled the enemy's last attack. In two days, they killed or wounded more than 210 enemies with grenades, 60mm mortars, rifles, and light machine guns. Other supporting firearms also killed or wounded more than 40 enemies.

	At another position, the reporters interviewed soldiers Yang Fangjian and Cheng Yunjie from the 5th Company of a certain unit. They and their comrades-in-arms guarded a hilltop position. On July 25, from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., the enemy used fifteen heavy artillery pieces to fiercely bombard the position they were guarding, with a total of more than 5,000 shells falling in eight hours. However, the squad was concealed in strong fortifications, and there were no casualties. When the shelling stopped and a platoon of enemies launched an attack, Yang Fangjian and Cheng Yunjie, who were stationed on the forefront, suddenly opened fire and shot down seven enemies, and the rest of the enemies retreated completely. On the night of July 25, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, the 3rd Platoon of the 6th Company of a certain unit recaptured the three hilltops that had been occupied by the enemy during the day with swift action. In less than two hours, the entire platoon killed more than 20 enemies, wounded more than 30 enemies, and captured four enemies, returning victoriously. The two squads of the platoon were awarded the collective First Class Merit.

    痛惩进犯军
    熊隆、野林
    在停战谈判期中，不断挑衅进攻的美国侵略军遭到了严阵以待的朝、中人民军队的重大杀伤。
    记者曾访问了据守在金化东北地区的志愿军某部。七月后半个月中，敌人向这一线阵地倾泻了两万发以上的炮弹和数百枚炸弹和烧夷弹，并以一排到一营的兵力对只有极少数兵力的该部前沿小山头阵地举行了十八次进攻；然而该部仍据守着半个月以前的原阵地，不同的只是进犯军的污血浸透了阵地前沿的泥土。仅在前沿阵地的战斗中，该部的前哨部队就杀伤了敌人五百多个，还打落打伤四架敌机。直到我军完成了歼敌任务后，才主动撤离了一些小山头。
    志愿军战士们决心用严重的打击来教训冒险进犯的盗匪。坚守在六○二点二高地最前沿一个小山头上的某班，在友邻部队配合下，接连打垮了美军一个连到一个营的多次进攻，在两天内杀伤了二百一十多个敌人，创造了以少数兵力歼灭大量敌人的光辉战例。在第一天激烈的战斗中，他们用手榴弹和步枪杀伤了敌人七十多，打垮敌人一个连的五次猛扑。夜间该班不顾疲劳，又加强了工事，准备迎接第二天的战斗。翌日拂晓，这些强固的工事抵住了敌人千余发炮弹的轰击，接着战士们又迎击了一个营敌人的攻击。当敌人的二次进攻被打垮了以后，敌人恼羞成怒，又重新组织了兵力，在各种炮火掩护下再度发起攻击。这时该班已由原来的九个人减少到三个人了。在班长李洪奎的沉着指挥下，他们三个人每人坚守着一个主要方向，将一排又一排的手榴弹投向相距不过二十多公尺的敌人群中。前三天曾以十三发子弹打落了一架敌机而当场被奖为特等功臣的机枪射手丛汝启，抱着机枪猛烈扫射；机枪发生了故障，就拿起手榴弹与步兵一起拚杀，直到腹部受伤，鲜血渗透了衣服，他还是不停地打手榴弹。在友邻部队配合下，他们终于打退了敌人最后一次的进攻。两天来他们以手榴弹和六零炮、步枪、轻机枪杀伤敌人二百一十多个，其他配合的火器也杀伤了敌人四十多。
    在另一个阵地上记者又访问了某部五连战士杨方建和程云杰。他们和同班的战友守在一个山头阵地上。七月二十五日那天，从早晨七点钟一直到下午三点钟，敌人用十五门重炮向他们所守的阵地猛烈排射，八小时内共落弹五千多发，可是该班隐蔽在坚固的工事里，无一伤亡。当炮击停止，一个排的敌人发起攻击时，据守在最前沿的杨方建和程云杰突然开火打倒了七个敌人，其余的敌人全部退下去。七月二十五日夜间，在猛烈的炮火掩护下，某部六连三排以迅速的动作接连夺回了白天被敌人占去的三座山头。不到两小时，全排即打死敌人二十多，打伤敌人三十多，俘敌四名胜利而归。该排的两个班记了集体的一等功。
