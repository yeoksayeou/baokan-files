New People, New Things in New China

	I Saw the Strength of Liberated Women During the Land Reform Movement
To the Editor:
	I am a housewife nearly fifty years old. I participated in the Southwest Land Reform Work Team. In the three and a half months, I received a profound education. I believe that the land reform movement is the only way to women's liberation. The broad masses of housewives should pay close attention to this movement and participate in this work as much as possible.

	What impressed me most was the people's love for Chairman Mao. This noble emotion educated me.

	When I came into contact with the peasants, I often encountered sincere and amiable old and young women who enthusiastically asked me: "Elder sister, you are from Beijing, have you seen Chairman Mao?" "Is Chairman Mao healthy?" "Does Chairman Mao also wear a gray cadre uniform?" Yang Dama, the 64-year-old mother of the village chief of the 11th Village of Yunmen Township, Hechuan County, Sichuan, one day took my hand and walked to the front of the rostrum, pointing to Chairman Mao's portrait and asked me: "Chairman Mao works so hard for us poor people, has his hair turned white?" Another day, a young mother brought three children to the meeting and sincerely asked me: "Elder sister, I ask you, does Chairman Mao love children?" "Of course!" I smiled and nodded to her. A happy smile appeared on her face.

	Secondly, I realized the greatness of the strength of liberated women.

	Zhao Xingyu, a 37-year-old woman representative and labor model from the Fifth Village of Qujia Township, Hechuan County, was the most active member in the rent reduction and deposit refund movement and the land reform movement. She suffered the deepest oppression from the landlords, so she was the most resolute in resisting the landlords. She told me that when she was eight years old, her father was so exploited by the landlords that he could not make a living, so he sold her to a landlord's family to be a child bride. When she was only eleven years old, the landlord called her to do unpaid labor. Once, the landlord's daughter lost a red hat and accused her of stealing it, forcing her almost to jump into the pond. She said indignantly: "Elder sister, you can't imagine the suffering of the poor in the countryside! A poor person's life is not worth an old hat in the landlord's house!" She also said: "Today, Chairman Mao led us to turn ourselves over. In the future, we must repay the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" She also told me that she had never studied before, but now that she has attended a literacy class, she can write six characters. I asked her what those six characters were. She said to me with a happy mood: "Three characters are my own name, and the other three characters are 'Chairman Mao'."

	Zhao Xingyu has a high degree of love for the motherland and Chairman Mao. Therefore, she has continued to create exemplary deeds in the village. One night, it suddenly rained heavily. Zhao Xingyu was afraid that the village granary would leak, so she went to check in the middle of the night, braving the heavy rain. From the flashing lightning, she found that a large tree had fallen on the roof of the warehouse. She thought to herself: "Guarding the warehouse and protecting the grain is the responsibility of the people." So she immediately mobilized more than ten men and more than ten women to move the fallen tree and cover the tiles in the heavy rain. The grain of the Fifth Village was therefore not damaged, and it won the title of "Grain Protection Model Village."

	The Fourth District of Hechuan County built a large-scale warehouse in Yunmen Town. There were more than 3,000 wooden boards to be transported from the Fifth Village of Qujia Township. The superiors instructed that the task should be completed in one day. The villagers thought that the round trip was forty miles and it could not be done. Zhao Xingyu immediately mobilized more than 540 men, women, and children in the entire village to transport all the wooden boards to the town on time. She herself carried four boards at a time. The district government therefore issued the village a "Labor is Glorious" banner. From these deeds, I felt the greatness of the strength of liberated women! And I deeply realized that Chinese women must actively participate in the revolutionary struggle and actively participate in land reform in order to strive for their complete liberation.

	When Floods Ravaged Xinmin County, Liaoxi
	The People's Liberation Army Rescued More Than 4,000 People
To the Editor:
	Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, suffered a flood last month, and more than half of the villages were flooded. All the comrades of a certain unit of our People's Liberation Army who were familiar with the water actively assisted the local people's government in rescue. After four days and nights of efforts, a total of more than 4,800 flood victims were rescued.

	In the rescue work, the PLA comrades showed a high degree of class friendship. The bugler of a certain battalion had not eaten for two days due to illness, but he still resolutely participated in the rescue and was very active. In the difficult situation of rapid water flow, unfamiliar terrain, and poor boating skills, the PLA comrades showed the greatest wisdom and bravery; many comrades jumped into the water, swimming and pulling the boat at the same time. The victims were very grateful and said: "Without you, how could we have survived!" The PLA comrades also gave their own dry food to the victims. An old lady in her eighties said: "The People's Liberation Army is really the army that loves the people the most."

	The old lady is right. We should be proud to have such a good army!

	"Youth Shunting Team" at Sujiatun Station
	Safe Shunting of 140,000 Couplings

	The Dai Tiangeng shunting team is the youngest shunting team at Sujiatun Station. The team consists of six people (four youth league members), the oldest being 24 years old and the youngest 18 years old. This team was only cultivated in March last year. Since they took on the shunting work, they have not had an accident for 580 days. They have created an excellent record of safe operation of 140,000 couplings. They are the most outstanding and advanced "Youth Shunting Team" at Sujiatun Station.

	The Dai Tiangeng shunting team regularly holds youth league and trade union group meetings. Every day after or before handing over, they spend half an hour reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of the day's work, studying how to improve the work, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. They also strengthen the contact work with the drivers, so that everyone works particularly "well together", so they can achieve continuous shunting of 140,000 couplings without accidents.

	The Dai Tiangeng shunting team humbly learns from the advanced Soviet experience - Katayev and Rungerhar's shunting method, using the method of segmented disassembly to accelerate the operation time; and can use classification lines flexibly, using empty lines or idle parts of the line to sort out the train and arrange the order of the train. They correctly grasped the operating speed, so it takes an average of only 17 minutes to disassemble each train. Their work is constantly rising and moving forward. In April of this year, the task was completed by 110%, in May the task was completed by 126%, in June the task was completed by 132.5%, and in July the task was completed by 143%. Although their work achievements have been increasing month by month, they have not had any arrogance and complacency. Recently, their group also proposed to achieve 600 days without accidents and safe operation of 150,000 couplings to celebrate National Day.

	Zhenjiang Locomotive Depot Water Supply Station
	Strengthening Inspection and Repair Work, 500 Days Without Accidents

	The Water Supply Station of Zhenjiang Locomotive Depot in Southern Jiangsu has created a glorious achievement of 500 days without accidents. On April 10, 1950, Wang Pansheng, the water supply stoker of the station, was paralyzed with thought and negligent in his work. He fell asleep while on the night shift, causing the train to run out of water and causing a 10-minute delay. After that, the station formulated various operating systems. In the winter of 1950, insulation work was done in advance before the severe cold. In October 1950, the upper water crane supplied water slowly, only adding one ton of water per minute. Therefore, the water supply train could not depart on time. After research by the water supply workers, it was believed that this was because the water supply pipe was blocked, and they immediately told the engineering section to repair it; as a result, a one-foot-long piece of rotten wood was found in the pipe. In April of this year, Mao Mingsong, the duty water supply driver, carefully checked during the handover and found that there was something wrong with the water source, and immediately notified the engineering section to repair it, eliminating the danger of water shortage in the entire station's water crane. In response to the Red May Labor Competition, in order to prolong the life of the boiler, the workers sorted out the water source and water quality, and went underwater four times to salvage aquatic plants, salvaging a total of 2,500 kilograms. All the workers in the station actively worked and created a glorious achievement of 500 days without accidents. Now they are working hard to strive for 600 days without accidents.

    我在土地改革运动中
    看到翻身妇女的力量编辑同志：
    我是一个将近五十岁的家庭妇女，这次参加了西南土地改革工作团，在整整三个半月中，我受到深刻的教育，我觉得土地改革运动，正是妇女解放的必由之路。广大的家庭妇女应该十分关心这个运动，尽可能参加这个工作。
    首先使我感触到的是群众对毛主席的热爱，这种崇高的情感教育了我。
    当我和农民接触时，经常遇到诚恳可亲的老少妇女热情地问我：“大姐，你是从北京来的，看见毛主席没有？”“毛主席健壮吗？”“毛主席也穿灰色干部服吗？”四川合川县云门乡十一村村长的母亲杨大妈，六十四岁了。一天，她牵着我的手，走向主席台前，指着毛主席的像问我：“毛主席为我们穷人办事，太辛苦了，他老人家的头发白了没有？”又有一天，一位年轻的母亲，带了三个小孩来开会，她诚挚地问我：“大姐，我问你，毛主席爱不爱小孩子？”“当然爱哪！”我笑着向她点点头。一种幸福的笑容泛上她的脸。
    其次，我体会到翻身妇女力量的伟大。
    合川县渠嘉乡五村妇女代表、劳动模范赵兴玉，三十七岁，她是减租退押运动和土地改革运动中最积极的分子。她受地主的压迫最深，所以反抗地主最坚决。她告诉我：她八岁时，父亲被地主剥削得不能生活，就把她卖到一家地主家当童养媳。她仅十一岁，就被地主叫去作无代价的劳役；有一次，地主的女儿有一顶红色帽子不见了，赖她偷去，逼得她几乎跳了池塘。她激愤地说：“大姐，你那里想得到乡下穷人的痛苦啊！一条穷人的活命，抵不上地主家的一顶旧帽子！”她又说：“今天毛主席领导我们翻了身，今后要好好报答共产党，报答毛主席！”她还告诉我，她过去没有读过书，现在上了民校以后，已经能够写六个字了。我问她是那六个字？她带着愉快的心情向我说：“三个字，是我自己的姓名，还有三个字，就是‘毛主席’。”
    赵兴玉对祖国对毛主席有高度的热爱，因此，她在村子里继续不断地创造出模范事迹。一天夜里，天忽然下大雨，赵兴玉怕村中粮库漏雨，半夜三更，冒着大雨去看。从闪闪的电光中，她发现有一棵大树倒在仓库的屋顶上。她心想：“守仓护粮，是人民的责任。”于是即刻动员了十多个男人，十多个妇女，在大雨中把倒下的树移开，并把瓦片盖好。五村的粮食因此没有损坏。获得“保粮模范村”的称号。
    合川县第四区在云门镇上建立大规模的仓库，有三千多块木板，要从渠嘉乡五村运去。上级指示要在一天中完成任务。村民都以为来回路程四十里，办不到。赵兴玉立刻动员了全村的男女老幼五百四十余人，按时把全部木板运送到镇上。她自己一次就背四块。区政府因此发给该村一面“劳动光荣”的旗帜。从这些事迹中，我感到翻身妇女力量的伟大！并深刻认识到：中国妇女必须积极参加革命斗争，积极参加土地改革，才能争取自己彻底解放。

    辽西新民县洪水泛滥时
    解放军营救四千余人脱险编辑同志：
    辽西省新民县上月遭受水灾，半数以上村庄被淹。我人民解放军某部全体谙水同志积极协助当地人民政府抢救，经四昼夜努力，共抢救四千八百余灾民脱险。
    该部解放军同志在抢救工作中，表现了高度的阶级友爱精神。某营司号员因病两天没有吃饭了，但仍坚决参加抢救，并很积极。在水势很急、地形生疏、划船技术不好的困难情况下，解放军同志们表现了最大的智慧和勇敢；许多同志跳下水去，一面泅水一面拉船。灾民十分感激地说：“没有你们，我们怎能活了啦！”解放军同志更把自己带的干粮送给灾民们吃。一位八十多岁的老太太说：“解放军真是最爱老百姓的军队。”
    老太太的话很对。我们应该为我们有这样好的军队而骄傲！
    罗慕法苏家屯车站“青年调车组”
    安全调车十四万钩
    戴天更调车组，是苏家屯车站最年青的一个调车组。全组六个人（四个青年团员），年龄最大的二十四岁，最小的十八岁。这个组是在去年三月间才培养起来的。他们自从担任调车工作以来，至今已五百八十天未出事故。创造了安全作业十四万钩的优良成绩。他们是苏家屯站最优秀最先进的“青年调车组”。
    戴天更调车组经常召开青年团和工会的小组会。他们每天在交班后或接班前，用半小时时间，检讨当天工作中的优缺点，研究如何改进工作，并展开批评和自我批评。他们也加强和司机的连络工作，使得大家干得特别“合手”，所以能做到连续溜放十四万钩不出事故。
    戴天更调车组很虚心地学习苏联先进经验——卡达也夫，和润格哈尔的调车法，利用分断解体办法，加速了作业时间；并能活用分类线，借用空线或线路的空闲部分，整理列车并编组列车的顺序。他们正确地掌握了作业速度，因此解体列车每列平均只需十七分钟。他们的工作是不断上升前进的。今年四月份完成任务百分之一百一十，五月份完成任务百分之一百二十六，六月份完成任务百分之一百三十二点五，七月份完成任务百分之一百四十三。虽然他们的工作成绩逐月提高，但却丝毫没有骄傲自满的情绪。最近他们小组又提出了要做到六百天无事故，安全作业十五万钩，来庆祝国庆节。

    镇江机务段给水所
    加强检修工作五百天无事故
    苏南镇江机务段给水所已经创造了五百天无事故的光荣成绩。一九五○年四月十日，该所给水司炉王盘生思想麻痹，工作疏忽，值夜班时打瞌睡，使列车缺水，造成晚点十分钟的事故。此后，该所即订出各项作业制度。一九五○年冬季，在严寒时期前，事先就做好保温工作。一九五○年十月间，上行水鹤给水缓慢，每分钟只能加水一吨。因此，给水列车不能正点开出。后经给水工友研究，认为这是因为送水管有阻塞，当即告诉工务段来修理；结果发现管内有一尺多长朽木一段。今年四月间，值班给水司机毛明松，交接班时小心检查，发现水源有毛病，即通知工务段修理，消灭了全站水鹤缺水的危险。迎接红五月劳动竞赛中，工友们为了延长锅炉寿命，整理了水源、水质，曾四次下水捞水草，共捞出二千五百公斤。该所全体工友积极工作，创造了五百天无事故的光荣成绩。现在正努力争取六百天不出事故。
