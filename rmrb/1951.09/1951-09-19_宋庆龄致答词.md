Chairman, Mr. Ehrenburg, Mr. Neruda, Gentlemen:

　　In the struggle to defend world peace, I am only striving to fulfill my personal responsibility to humanity. To be awarded the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations" is, for me personally, an infinitely honorable event in the course of my life. In particular, to be associated with the great name of Stalin, to be listed alongside those men and women who have written their names in the glorious pages of history for the struggle to defend peace, is a special and supreme honor. I am deeply moved. This will be an unforgettable moment for me, one that I will cherish forever.

　　I will always remember this evening, I will always hold it dear, not only for my personal sake, but because this honor belongs to the Chinese people. Defending peace is not something that any individual can accomplish alone. An individual only represents the wishes and hopes of the masses, and unites and acts together with them. Therefore, I accept this award as a representative of the Chinese people, who for a hundred years, especially in the last thirty years, have seen their own land and the lands of their neighbors ravaged by war more than once. I accept this award as a member of a nation who, since October 1, 1949, has tasted the joy of liberation, national unity, and the tremendous development of unprecedented peaceful construction. I accept this award as a representative of one-quarter of humanity, whose experience tells them that they must firmly unite with peace fighters all over the world.

　　The Chinese people have fully demonstrated their position. More than 223 million Chinese people have signed the Stockholm Appeal; 344,053,057 people, accounting for 72.4% of the total population, have signed in support of the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact; 339,903,092 people, accounting for 71.5% of the total population, have voted against the United States rearming Japan. If people feel that these numbers are not convincing enough, then they can come and see for themselves the tremendous achievements that the Chinese people have made in rebuilding our country. These works undoubtedly demonstrate how much we cherish peace. If in just a few years, we can liberate hundreds of millions of peasants, increase agricultural production to the point of self-sufficiency and beyond, if we can create conditions for the complete recovery and development of industry and commerce, if we can simultaneously carry out huge infrastructure projects, just imagine how much we could do in an environment of lasting world peace! In such an environment, the future of the new China is infinitely bright!

　　Because we sincerely need peace, we have also fully demonstrated our determination and courage to defend peace. Together with our Korean comrades-in-arms, the Chinese People's Volunteers have fully demonstrated that we will not hesitate to shed blood for this noble goal. For peace, there is no greater expression than this, and it also demonstrates our firmness, determination, and infinite power in resisting imperialist aggression, and demonstrates our unity and readiness to resist at any time when our territory is threatened.

　　In our great struggle to build our country, resist American aggression, and defend our homes and country, the Chinese people have fully understood who is always on our side and always cares for us with enthusiasm. Our peasants and workers call Soviet friends "elder brother" and Stalin the greatest leader of all peaceful forces. This is perfectly justified. This close connection was formed during the long years of our revolutionary struggle. Now, our unity with the peace-loving Soviet people is more solid than ever; our respect and love for the great leader of the Soviet Union has also increased immeasurably.

　　This indestructible unity is built on the foundation of our shared belief in people's power and lasting peace. Like the brightest new star rising in the sky, this historic combination has changed the entire international relationship. This historic combination marks the unprecedented unity of vast lands and peoples, including the Soviet Union, China, and other progressive countries, under the banner of peace. This historic combination includes the amazing achievements of the Soviet Union over the past thirty-three years, and the rapid rise of China and other people's democratic countries in recent years. The fundamental strength of this struggle for peace is unmatched in the world. We can repeat and affirm that the forces of peace will surely win the final victory.

　　We live in this vast and bright land, but at the same time, there is also a dark side to this world, where darkness and suspicion are produced, where war and destruction are clamored for. The unpopular and irrational American rulers enslave some countries. The funds that those governments allocate to people's welfare and cultural undertakings have been repeatedly reduced to meager handouts, while the expenses paid for armaments have reached astronomical figures. A small number of monopolistic capitalists laugh with glee because they have obtained huge profits. But the broad masses of people are trapped in the abyss of suffering, emaciated and haggard. At the same time, democracy there is distorted and manipulated. People's leaders are thrown into prison and treated the same as ordinary criminals, simply because they have thoughts, because they sincerely call for peace. At the same time, due to the planned creation of hatred by a few rulers, the unity of the people is divided and weakened, especially in the United States, even leading to the "legal" murder of Willie McGee and others, whose crime was that they were people of color.

　　But the patience of the people is limited. Even in that mad and insidious land, the light of peace and reason is bravely piercing the darkness and repelling the countercurrent. No matter how the warmongers persecute, they cannot do as they please even in the lands they control. America's financial giants and generals can wave their whips and force their governments to obey, but whether they can drive the people to carry out their aggressive policies is another question. The people will roar, the people will protest. Because the people fear war, the people hate war. The people need peace.

　　The recent elections in France and Italy show that people cannot use the symbol of gold to write the word truth. Those governments backed by the United States and their fascist parties used all sorts of methods, including cheating and fraud, controlling voting machines, threatening and bribing, and even blatantly using violence. Even so, the people of these two countries still cast a large number of votes for the domestic parties that advocate democracy and peace. In Spain, more than one million workers went on strike to protest the hunger caused by Franco's rule and the illegal act of joining the Atlantic Treaty. In heroic Spain, the cry of "Eliminate Fascism!" spread throughout many cities. In Japan and West Germany, people have clearly expressed their refusal to be cannon fodder for America's arrogant plan to conquer the world. In the United Kingdom, the voice of protest is also growing. The people have unanimously expressed their indignation at the government officials' servile behavior in acting as accomplices of the United States. In the colonies and semi-colonies, profound changes are also unfolding. It shows that the oppressed people all over the world have realized that their struggle for independence is directly related to world peace, and they have understood that a threat to any one nation is also a threat to another.

　　Similarly, we can also see that in the United States itself, although the people have not yet been fully organized, they have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the ruling group of Wall Street. We have seen the people's joy at the removal and downfall of war criminal MacArthur, we have heard their support for the call for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, they have responded to Congressman Johnson's proposal and Malik's speech at the United Nations. This support is entirely spontaneous, and news blockades and the wanton distortions of the so-called free press cannot hide this fact. Even radio commentators, columnists, and public opinion polls controlled by monopolistic capital have had to admit that the people are eager for the end of the Korean War. Religious figures, professors, workers, and the five thousand delegates to the American Peace Congress - all show that the American people, like the people of the world, are demanding peace. As the number of casualties in Korea continues to increase, as more young people are forced to put on military uniforms and be sent to Europe and Asia, the mothers, fathers, and wives of America are becoming more anxious and more concerned. They have further realized the necessity of striving for world peace and have expressed their thoughts. However, the destroyers of peace are unwilling to hear the word "peace," and they are frantically stepping up preparations for war. They are intensifying fascist agitation at home and stifling any resistance. They are molding young people into fascist beasts and then preparing to unleash them abroad. They are insatiable, they are violating the will of their own people and the people of other countries, and they are trying to launch a war. They are determined to crush the sovereignty of the people, determined to ruthlessly strangle the people's desire for a peaceful life of unity and cooperation. This is their evil attempt, their mad conspiracy.

　　But Stalin tells us that in such times, war is not inevitable. We can still avoid this terrible danger if the people take the task of defending peace into their own hands. When we see that all the people around us love peace and desire peace, we know that this is the truth. But we must turn this truth into action. We must organize broad sponsorship of the belief in world peaceful coexistence, regardless of political, national, or religious beliefs. If the ordinary men and women of the world, those who have suffered the pain of war, unite and demand that sincere negotiations replace the use of force to resolve international disputes, then we will not have war. This belief and action can be realized, as long as the program of the World Peace Council receives the widest attention and consideration; as long as the importance of the Five-Power Peace Pact receives universal recognition. The people, with a united voice, can clear the way for the peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the world. At that time, all mankind will live only to create and enjoy the fruits of labor. We must carry this struggle to its final success.

    宋庆龄致答词主席：爱伦堡先生，聂鲁达先生，诸位先生：
    在保卫世界和平的斗争中，我只是努力尽着我个人对人类所应负的责任。能够因此而被授予“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金，对我个人说来，在人生的历程当中，不能不说这是一件无限荣幸的事，特别是能够和斯大林的伟大名字连在一起，能够那些为了保卫和平的斗争而将他们的姓名写在历史的光辉书页上的男女们列在一起，更是一个特殊的无上的光荣。我深深地受到了感动。这将是我终生难忘、永远珍爱的一个时辰。
    我将永远记得今天这个晚上，我将把它长系心头，这不仅是为了我个人的缘故，而是为了这个光荣是属于中国人民的。保卫和平不是任何个人所能够完成的事。个人只是代表了人民大众的心愿和希望，并且和他们联合起来一致行动。因此，我是以中国人民的一个代表来接受这个奖金的，中国人民在一百年来，特别是近三十年来，曾经看见他们自己的和他们邻邦的土地不止一次被战争所蹂躏。我是以这样一个民族的一分子来接受这个奖金的，从一九四九年十月一日起，他们已经尝到解放的欢欣，全国的统一，以及史无先例的和平建设事业的巨大发展。我是以人类四分之一的代表来接受这个奖金的，他们的经验告诉他们，他们必须坚决地和全世界的和平战士团结在一起。
    中国人民充分地表明了他们的主张。中国人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的，已达二亿二千三百万人以上；签名拥护缔结五强和平公约的，已达三四四、○五三、○五七人，占全人口百分之七十二·四；投票反对美国重新武装日本的，达三三九、九○三、○九二人，占全人口百分之七十一·五。如果人们觉得这些数字的说服力还不够，那么可以亲自来看看中国人民在重建我们国家中所取得的巨大成就。这些工作无疑问的说明了我们是何等宝贵和平。如果我们在短短几年内，能够解放亿万农民、提高农业生产量到自足和超过的程度，如果我们能够为工商业创造全部恢复和发展的条件，如果我们能够同时进行巨大的基本建设，试想，我们在
    一个长久的世界和平的环境里，我们将能够做多少事啊！在这样一个环境中，新中国的前途是无限光明的！
    由于我们衷心需要和平，我们也充分表明了我们具有保卫和平的决心和勇气。和朝鲜战友们在一起，中国人民志愿军充分表现出，为了我们这一崇高的目标，我们是不惜流血的。为了和平，没有比这更伟大的表现，同时这也表现了我们抵抗帝国主义侵略时的刚毅坚定、力量无穷，表现出当我们领土遭受威胁时的同仇敌忾，随时抗击。
    在我们建设国家、抵抗美国侵略、保家卫国的巨大斗争中，中国人民已经充分明了，谁是永远站在我们一边，永远热烈关心着我们的。我们的农民和工人称呼苏联友人为“老大哥”，称斯大林为一切和平力量的最伟大的领袖。这是有充分的道理的。这个紧密的联系是在我们的革命斗争悠长岁月中形成的。现在，我们与爱好和平的苏联人民的团结，是比过去更巩固了；我们对苏联伟大领袖的敬爱也无比地增强了。
    这一不可摧毁的团结，是建筑在我们对人民政权与持久和平具有共同信念的基础之上的。就像在天空，升起了一颗最光亮的新星一样。这一历史性的结合变更了整个国际关系。这一历史性的结合标志了有史以来从未有过的广大土地和人民，包括苏联、中国和其他进步国家，已经在和平的旗帜下，团结起来。这一历史性的结合包括了苏联在过去三十三年来的惊人成就，与中国以及其他人民民主国家的近几年内的迅速的勃兴。这一和平斗争的根本力量是举世无匹的。我们可以重复肯定，和平的力量必将获得最后的胜利。
    我们生活在这一大片广大的光明土地上，但同时存在于这个世界上的，还有那黑暗的一面，那儿产生着黑暗和猜疑，那儿叫嚣着战争和毁灭。那不获人心的、丧失理性的美国统治者奴役着一些国家。那些政府拨作人民福利和文化事业的经费已经一再减削、成为微薄的施舍，而为军备所支付的费用，却达到了天文学的数字。少数独占资本家们欢欣狞笑，因为他们获得了大量的暴利。但广大的人民却陷于痛苦的深渊，消瘦憔悴。同时在那儿，民主也遭受到歪曲和播弄。人民的领袖们被投入牢狱，遭受和普通罪犯同样的待遇，其原因不过是为了他们具有思想，为了他们真诚地呼吁和平。同时，由于少数统治者有计划地制造仇恨，人民的团结也遭到分裂和削弱，特别是在美国，甚至造成了“合法”谋杀威利·麦基他们的事件，罪状是为了他们是有色人种的缘故。
    但是人民的忍耐是有限度的，即使是在那疯狂的阴险的土地上，和平和理智光芒也在勇敢地刺穿黑暗，击退逆流。无论战争贩子们怎样进行迫害，即使在他们自己控制的土地上，他们也不能畅所欲为。美国的金融巨头兼将军们可以挥舞皮鞭，叫他们的政府就范，但他们能不能驱使人民去执行他们的侵略政策，那是另一个问题。人民要怒吼，人民要抗议。因为人民惧怕战争，人民厌恨战争。人民需要和平。
    最近法国和意大利的选举，表明了人们是无法用金元的符号来书写真理这个字的。那些以美国作后台老板的政府及其法西斯党羽，运用了种种方法，包括舞弊作假，控制投票机器，威胁利诱，甚至明目张胆地施行暴力。即使这样，这两个国家的人民依旧向他们国内的主张民主和平的政党投了大量的选票。在西班牙，一百万以上的工人为了反对佛朗哥统治所造成的饥饿和抗议加入大西洋公约的非法行为而举行了罢工。在英勇的西班牙，许多城市里传遍了“消灭法西斯主义！”的呼声。在日本和西德，人民明显地表示了他们拒绝充当美国征服世界的狂妄计划的炮灰。在英国，抗议的呼声也日益增高。对于政府官吏的奴颜婢膝，甘作美国帮凶，人民一致表示愤慨。在殖民地和半殖民地，深刻的变化也正在展开。它表明了全世界的受压迫者已经认清了他们的争取独立的斗争和世界和平是有直接关联的，他们已经懂得加于任何一个民族的威胁，必然也是加于另一民族的。
    同样，我们也可以看见，在美国本国内，人民虽则还没有充分组织起来，但他们也向华尔街的统治集团表示了不满。我们看到人民对战犯麦克阿瑟被撤职下台所表示的快慰，我们听到了他们对要求和平解决朝鲜问题的呼吁的支持，他们响应了国会中的约翰逊的提案，以及马立克在联合国的演说。这个支持是完全自发的，新闻封锁和所谓自由报纸的肆意歪曲，都不能掩盖这一事实。即使是在独占资本控制下的广播评论家、专栏作家、民意测验，也不得不承认人民急切希望朝鲜战事的结束。宗教家们、教授们、工人们、美国和平大会的五千代表们——都表示美国人民正和全世界人民一样是要求和平的。当朝鲜的伤亡数字继续增加的时候，当更多的青年人被迫穿上军装、被遣派到欧洲和亚洲去的时候，美国的母亲们、父亲们、妻子们是更加焦急，更加挂虑了。他们已更进一步认识到争取世界和平的必要，并且将他们的思想吐露出来。然而，和平的破坏者们是不愿听到“和平”这个字的，他们正在疯狂加强备战。他们正在国内加强法西斯主义的煽动，加强对任何反抗的窒息。他们把青年模造成法西斯野兽，然后准备将他们纵放国外。他们贪得无厌，他们违背了自己国内的人民和其他国家人民的意愿，企图发动战争。他们一心要粉碎人民的主权，一心要无情地绞杀人民要求团结合作的和平生活的愿望。这就是他们的罪恶企图、疯狂阴谋。
    但是斯大林告诉我们，在这样的时候，战争不是不可避免的。我们依旧可以避免这可怕的危险，如果人民把保卫和平的任务掌握在自己手中的话。当我们看见我们周围所有的人民都爱好和平、愿望和平的时候，我们知道这是真理。但是我们必须把这个真理化为行动。我们必须不分政治、民族和宗教信仰，组织对世界和平共处的信念之广泛的赞助。如果全世界的普通男女，那些身受战争痛苦的人们，团结一致，要求用诚意的谈判来代替用武力来解决国际间的纷争，那么我们就不会有战争。这一信念和行动是能够实现的，只要使世界和平理事会的纲领，获得最广泛的注意和考虑；只要使五强缔结和平公约的重要性，获得普遍的承认。人民以一致的呼声能够清除道路，使世界各国人民和平共居。那时候整个人类将只为创造和享受劳动的成果而生存。我们必须将这一斗争进行到最后成功。
