"World Knowledge" Publishes Article Commemorating Thälmann

Thälmann was a great German revolutionary, leader of the German Communist Party, and heroic anti-fascist fighter. He was assassinated by the Hitler gang on August 18, 1944, at the Buchenwald concentration camp. August 18th of this year marked the seventh anniversary of Thälmann's death. The "World Knowledge" published on September 1st contains an article by President Wilhelm Pieck entitled "Thälmann – The Prototype of Young Peace Fighters" to commemorate this great leader of the German people and peace fighter.

President Pieck's article recounts how Thälmann joined the ranks of the working-class struggle early in his life and became a leader of the workers' movement. During the First World War, Thälmann became a fighter against imperialist war. In 1920, he moved from the German Independent Social Democratic Party to the German Communist Party, was elected to the Central Committee of the German Communist Party in 1922, and was elected Chairman of the German Communist Party in 1925. During this period, he led the German people's great struggle against fascism. From March 1933, he spent eleven and a half years in Hitler's torture chambers. All the torture and torment could not defeat Thälmann's will. This loyal fighter for the cause of the Party and the people did not waver for a second in prison and fought until the last moment of his life.

President Pieck's article concludes by calling on the German people and all peace-loving people around the world to learn from Thälmann's fighting spirit. He wrote: "Thälmann's name is a signal for those who demand peace, whether in Germany, in Europe, in the Soviet Union, in Asia, in the Americas, or in other countries, wherever there are peace-loving people."

    “世界知识”刊载纪念台尔曼的文章
    台尔曼是德国伟大的革命家，德国共产党领袖，英勇的反法西斯的战士。他于一九四四年八月十八日在布赫瓦特集中营被希特勒匪帮所暗杀。今年八月十八日是台尔曼逝世七周年纪念日。九月一日出版的“世界知识”刊载威廉·皮克总统所撰的题为
    “台尔曼——年青的和平战士的典型”一文，以纪念这位伟大的德国人民的领袖与和平战士。
    皮克总统的文章叙述台尔曼早年就加入了工人阶级斗争的行列，并成为工人运动的领导者。在第一次世界大战期间，台尔曼又成为一个反对帝国主义战争的战士。一九二○年他从德国独立社会民主党转入德国共产党，一九二二年被选为德国共产党的中央委员，一九二五年被选为德国共产党的主席。在这一期间，他领导了德国人民反对法西斯主义的伟大斗争。从一九三三年三月起，他在希特勒的拷刑室里度过整整十一年半，一切折磨和拷打都不能挫败台尔曼的意志。这位党和人民事业的忠贞战士，在狱中一秒钟也没有动摇过，一直斗争到他生命的最后一刻。
    皮克总统的文章最后号召德国人民和全世界爱好和平的人们学习台尔曼的斗争精神。他写道：“台尔曼的名字是要求和平的人们的信号，这些人无论在德国，在欧洲，在苏联，在亚洲，在美洲或其他国家，只要是在有爱好和平的人们的地方。”
