Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 22nd: This reporter has learned that two days after the reply from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Ridgway was sent on September 20th, at 6:15 this morning, the United Nations Command notified our delegation by telephone that it would send important documents at 9:00 a.m. today. However, a few minutes later, they suddenly notified us of the cancellation. The other side's wavering clearly indicates that Tokyo and Washington are attempting to play some new tricks.

    美方又企图玩新花样
    昨晨美方以电话通知我方宣称将送来重要文件，数分钟后忽又通知取消。
   【新华社开城二十二日电】记者获悉：在金日成彭德怀两将军致李奇微复函于九月二十日送出的两天之后，在今晨六时一刻，联合国军方面以电话通知我方代表团，宣称将于本日上午九时送来重要文件。但数分钟后，忽又通知取消。对方如此摇摆不定显然是东京与华盛顿间又在企图玩什么新的花样。
