    Self-Criticism Regarding Handling of Tax Evasion Issues

    To the Editor:
    We sincerely accept the criticism made by Comrade Wu Heqian in the "Readers' Letters" section of the People's Daily on September 5th regarding our improper handling of the tax evasion issue at the Junxian County Post Office. We now report the situation and the results of the handling as follows:

    I. We only learned after receiving the report from the Junxian County Post Office that the bureau had evaded stamp tax totaling 162,485 yuan. This is the result of our neglecting political study, neglecting national policies and laws, and failing to recognize the important significance of tax work. In our letter to the Junxian County Post Office, we only stated: "The Provincial Bureau has a clear regulation that taxes should be paid in accordance with regulations. Since your office does not implement the system, this fine cannot be reimbursed." At the same time, we sent a letter to the local leading authorities, stating that the Junxian County Post Office director's work style was rough and careless and his education level was low, and that he did not intentionally evade taxes, requesting that the fine be reduced. This shows that we did not proceed from political principles in handling the issue.

    II. In order to correct the above errors, we agree with the tax bureau's principle of imposing a fine of ten times the amount of the evaded tax on the Junxian County Post Office, and we have asked the Junxian County Post Office director to make a thorough self-criticism on this issue again. We have also notified all post offices in the region to pay attention to this matter.

### 平原省邮政管理局  关于处理漏税问题的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    平原省邮政管理局
    关于处理漏税问题的检讨编辑同志：
    我们诚恳接受人民日报九月五日“读者来信专页”登载的吴合谦同志对我们处理浚县邮局漏税问题不当的批评。今将情况与处理结果报告如下：
    一、我们接到浚县邮局报告后，才知道该局曾漏贴印花税十六万二千四百八十五元。这是我们忽视政治学习，忽视国家政策法令，不认识税收工作的重要意义的结果。在我们发往浚县邮局的信件中，只说明：“省局有明文规定，应照章纳税，你处既不执行制度，故不能报销此项罚金。”同时又给该地领导机关一信，说明浚县邮局局长作风粗枝大叶，文化程度较低，并非有意漏税，请求从轻罚款。这说明了我们在处理问题上不是从政治原则出发的。
    二、为纠正上述的错误，我们同意税局对浚县邮局漏税罚款十倍的处理原则，重新让浚县邮局局长对此问题作深刻检查。并通报全区各地邮局，对此事引起注意。
    平原省邮政管理局
