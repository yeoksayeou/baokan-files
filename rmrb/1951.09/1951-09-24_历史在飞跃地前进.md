History is Advancing by Leaps and Bounds
Wu Yaozong

In the past two years, history seems to have been driving on a fast track, transforming our ancient country completely in an instant. It's as if we have suddenly moved from a dilapidated, collapsing house into a magnificent and beautiful mansion, and we know that we ourselves are the masters of this mansion. Although the mansion is only in its initial stages, it already fills us with admiration and wonder, beyond our control. To express my personal experiences in the past two years today is truly not an easy task.

First of all, I deeply feel that the suffering endured by the Chinese people for thousands of years has been fundamentally and permanently relieved. For over a hundred years, imperialism has invaded us, but today it has been driven out by us. With the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, the former tyrannical and terrifying rule, and the inhumane feudal exploitation, have also been eliminated. The earth-shattering land reform is about to eradicate the feudal exploitation system of thousands of years from its roots throughout the country. A few days ago, I went to the suburbs of Shanghai to visit the land reform. I saw the peasant masses angrily accusing a ferocious landlord; I saw this landlord, who used to be like a wolf and a tiger, bowing his head before the masses today; I saw the liberated, proud peasants, in control of their own destiny, preparing to work hard for the construction of New China. I participated in the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Revolutionary Case Review Committee. I have read some case files about counter-revolutionary elements, and the crimes they committed are almost unimaginable. For thousands of years, no one dared to question the local bullies and evil gentry, corrupt officials and bureaucrats who rode on the backs of the people. For more than a hundred years, the reactionary forces directly commanded by imperialism have also run amok. However, today they have been judged by the people and sanctioned by the law.

Not only has the suffering of the people been relieved, but the happiness of the people has also been fully guaranteed in the multi-faceted construction of New China. The inflation that has threatened us for more than a decade has been curbed. The Huai River basin, which used to suffer from disasters every year, has actually had a bumper harvest this year. We used to be short of grain every year, but now we actually have surplus grain to transport to foreign countries. After liberation, I passed the Huai River Bridge, which was destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, several times, and I almost thought that repair was impossible. However, in less than a year, the bridge was actually repaired. On the Shanghai market, I see new constructions every day. Not long ago, the Shanghai Native Products Exchange Exhibition deeply made me realize that even under the imperialist blockade, we still have sufficient strength to be self-reliant.

We have not only achieved brilliant achievements on the economic front, but we have also achieved great victories on the ideological front. Under the leadership of the great Mao Zedong Thought, in the widespread and in-depth movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the broad masses of the people have recognized the detestable nature of imperialism, the loveliness of the motherland, and the unconquerable strength of the Chinese people. We no longer hear the pessimistic and unambitious arguments of "there is no reason if China does not perish"; on the contrary, the people of the whole country have expressed full confidence in the construction of New China. In several international conferences, I saw international friends with a sense of justice admire and love New China; in every large-scale demonstration procession in the country, especially in this year's Shanghai "May Day" celebration in which more than 80% of the citizens participated, I saw the infinitely bright future of New China shining from the confident, organized, and led masses.

The suffering of the Chinese people has begun to be relieved, and the great construction of New China has begun. This is all due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The correctness, meticulousness, and ingenuity of this leadership are almost unbelievable. A complete set of theories, facing a complex and ever-changing situation, yet the inevitable evolution of everything can be accurately, sometimes almost flawlessly, calculated. I have read Liu Bowen's "Shaobing Song" before, which was nothing more than some subjective fantasies. Today, what the Communist Party gives us is a scientific ideological method typified by Chairman Mao's "On Practice." This set of ideological methods has already achieved victory in China and will also achieve victory in the world. The Chinese Communist Party, after thirty years of struggle, after the arduous and heroic "Long March," after the unyielding War of Resistance Against Japan, and after the invincible War of Liberation, its strength has been proven to the people of China and the world. The future of New China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, is absolutely no problem. In my experience over the past two years, what I admire most is the Communist Party's policy of the united front. The Communist Party is sincerely cooperating with everyone outside the party, including us religious believers, on the basis of the common program. On this common foundation, we are all comrades-in-arms, all members of the same family. The Communist Party's spirit of serving the people has also given me a deep impression, and at the same time makes us, who call ourselves Christians, feel very ashamed. The recent discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun" has further made me realize the serious, scientific, and meticulous attitude of the Communist Party in handling ideological issues.

Finally, from the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Christianity, I recognized the comprehensiveness of the Chinese revolution. If imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China were not overthrown, the renewal of Christianity would be impossible. But today, after these three enemies have been overthrown, Christians throughout the country have generally awakened. They have begun to recognize the ferocious face of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, they have recognized the fact that imperialism uses Christianity to carry out aggression, and they have expressed their determination to sever ties with imperialism and eliminate the influence of imperialism in thought and action. In the year or so since the publication of the Christian Reform Declaration, Christians in various places have enthusiastically participated in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, showing unprecedented patriotic enthusiasm. The ongoing accusation of imperialist elements and Christian scum across the country has enabled Christianity to liquidate its past history of more than 140 years and embark on a bright future. Up to now, nearly 300,000 people have signed the Reform Declaration, accounting for one-third of the Christians in the country. With the development of the reform movement, many Christians have gained a deeper understanding of the face of New China, the essence of the new regime, and the government's religious policy. They know that only in the people's New China can Christianity have a healthy development and obtain true freedom.

History is advancing by leaps and bounds. If imperialism still wants to use despicable means and frenzied aggression to destroy our newborn, great, and lovable People's Republic of China, it will only accelerate its own demise.

专栏：庆祝建国两周年

    历史在飞跃地前进
    吴耀宗
    这两年来，历史好像开着快车，使我们这个古老的国家，在瞬息之间，完全改变了它的面貌。我们好像从一个破烂的，将要倒塌的房子，忽然走进一个宏伟美丽的大厦，并且知道我们自己就是这个大厦的主人。大厦虽然只是初具规模，但已经使我们赞叹惊奇，不能自己。今天要我表达在过去两年中自己亲身的体验，那实在不是一件容易的事。
    首先，我深深地体验到中国人民几千年来所受的痛苦，是已经根本地、永远地解除了。一百多年来帝国主义侵略我们，但今天它已经被我们赶出去了。随着国民党反动政权的崩溃，从前暴虐恐怖的统治，惨无人道的封建剥削，也跟着消灭了。天翻地覆的土地改革，即将在全国把几千年封建剥削的制度从根铲除。前几天我到上海市郊区去参观土地改革，我看见农民群众，对一个凶恶的地主忿怒的控诉；我看见这个过去如狼似虎的地主，今天在群众面前低头；我看见翻了身的、骄傲的农民，掌握了自己的命运，准备着为新中国的建设而努力。我参加了上海市反革命案件审查委员会。我曾经翻阅过一些关于反革命分子的案卷，他们所犯的罪恶，有些是几乎不能想像的。几千年来，骑在人民头上的恶霸豪绅、贪官污吏是没有人敢过问的。一百多年以来，在帝国主义直接指挥下的反动力量，也是横行无忌的。但是，今天他们受了人民的审判，受了法律的制裁。
    不但人民的痛苦解除了，在新中国多方面的建设中，人民的幸福也有了充分的保障。十几年来一直威胁着我们的通货膨胀被制止了。每年受灾的淮河流域，今年居然能够丰收。以前我们每年缺粮，而现在我们居然有剩余的粮食运到外国。解放后，我曾经几次走过被蒋匪帮炸毁了的淮河大桥，我几乎认为修理是不可能的。然而，在不到一年当中，桥居然修好了。在上海的市面上，我每天都看到新的建设。不久以前，在上海举行的土产交流展览大会，使我深深地体验到：就是在帝国主义封锁之下，我们还是有充分的力量自力更生的。
    我们不但在经济的战线上有了辉煌的成就，我们在思想的战线上也获得了巨大的胜利。在伟大的毛泽东思想的领导下，在普遍深入的抗美援朝运动中，广大的人民群众认识了帝国主义的可恨，认识了祖国的可爱，认识了中国人民不可征服的力量。我们不再听见“中国不亡无天理”的那种悲观的、没有志气的论调；相反地，全国人民都表示了对新中国建设的充分信心。在几次国际会议里面，我看见具有正义感的国际友人们对新中国的推崇与热爱；在国内每一个大规模的示威游行行列里，尤其是在今年上海“五一”节百分之八十以上市民参加的庆祝集会中，我看见从有信心，有组织，有领导的群众里闪耀出来的，新中国无限光明的前途。
    中国人民的痛苦开始解除了，新中国伟大的建设开始进行了，这都是由于中国共产党的领导。这个领导的正确细致巧妙几乎使人难于置信。一套完整的理论，面临着一个复杂的，千变万化的情况，然而一切事情必然的演变，都能够准确地、有时几乎是丝毫不爽地被计算出来。我以前看过刘伯温的“烧饼歌”，那不过是一些主观的幻想。今天共产党所给我们的却是一套以毛主席的“实践论”为典型的科学的思想方法。这一套思想方法已经在中国取得胜利，也将在全世界取得胜利。中国共产党经过三十年的奋斗，经过艰苦卓绝的“长征”，经过百折不挠的抗日战争，经过无坚不摧的解放战争，它的力量已经在全中国、全世界人民的面前证明了，新中国的前途，在共产党领导之下，是绝对没有问题的。在我过去两年的经验中，尤其使我佩服的，是共产党统一战线的政策。共产党是同党外一切的人，包括我们宗教信徒，在共同纲领的基础上，诚心诚意地合作的。在这个共同基础之上，我们都是战友，都是一家的人。共产党为人民服务的精神也给了我一个深刻的印象，同时使我们自称为基督徒的，感到非常的惭愧。最近关于“武训传”的讨论，更使我体会到共产党处理思想问题的严肃的、科学的、丝毫不苟的态度。
    最后，从基督教的三自革新运动中，我认识了中国革命的全面性。如果在中国的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义没有被打倒，基督教的革新是不可能的。但是今天，在这三个敌人被推翻以后，全国的基督徒都普遍地觉醒起来了。他们开始认识了帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义穷凶极恶的面目，他们认识了帝国主义利用基督教来进行侵略的事实，并且在思想上和行动上表示了割断与帝国主义的联系，肃清帝国主义影响的决心。在基督教革新宣言发表后的一年多当中，各地的基督徒热烈地参加了抗美援朝运动，表现了空前的爱国热诚。现在正在全国开展的对帝国主义分子和基督教败类的控诉，使基督教清算了它过去一百四十多年的历史，走上了光明的前途。到目前为止，在革新宣言上签名的，已将近三十万人，占全国基督徒的三分之一。随着革新运动的发展，许多基督徒对新中国的面貌，对新政权的本质，对政府的宗教政策，都有了进一步的认识。他们知道：只有在人民的新中国，基督教才能有健全的发展，才能获得真正的自由。
    历史是飞跃地前进着。如果帝国主义还想用卑鄙的手段和疯狂的侵略来破坏我们这个新生的、伟大可爱的中华人民共和国，它就只有加速它自己的灭亡。
