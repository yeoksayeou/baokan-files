    Newspapers and Periodicals Should Use the Method of Factual Comparison to Deeply Propagandize the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

    To the Editor:
    Newspapers and periodicals using concrete facts, especially the method of comparison, to expose the darkness and corruption of imperialist countries, and to introduce the thriving new atmosphere of people's democratic countries, is one of the best ways to educate the broad masses of readers. For example, the articles "I Was Sentenced to Death" and "A Memoir of a Liberated Peasant in Democratic Germany," published in the 24th volume, issues 2, 3 and 5 of "World Knowledge," are some good examples. The author of the former article, an American black man named Wells, exposed the crimes and darkness of the American imperialist system through the concrete facts of how he was innocently arrested, imprisoned, and sentenced to death under the "American civilization" system, enabling readers to deeply realize the essence of American imperialism—not "civilization," but barbarism. The latter article introduced a liberated peasant in Democratic Germany named Peter Mann, who, after the land reform, was allocated land and housing, and was building a happy life with his family. This allows readers to appreciate how happy the people are in democratic countries. Using such a clear comparative method for propaganda can not only stimulate the hatred of the broad masses of the people towards imperialism and their love for socialist countries and people's democratic countries, but also clearly point out why we must oppose imperialism and why we must take the path of people's democracy and socialism. Although many newspapers and periodicals have also published some such articles, they are still not systematic and specific enough. Therefore, I suggest that national newspapers and periodicals publish more articles and dispatches in this regard using the method of factual comparison, which will be more helpful to in-depth propaganda and education on the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and strengthening national defense.

    报刊应多用事实对比方法
    深入宣传抗美援朝运动编辑同志：
    报纸、刊物通过具体的事实，特别是以对比的方法，来揭露帝国主义国家的黑暗腐败，介绍人民民主国家欣欣向荣的新气象，是教育广大读者的最好方法之一。像“世界知识”二十四卷二、三期与五期上分别刊载的“我被判处了死刑”和“记民主德国的一个翻身农民”两文，就是一些较好的例子。前一篇文章的作者——美国黑人韦尔斯，通过他自己如何在“美国文明”制度下，被无辜地逮捕入狱，判处死刑等具体事实，揭露了美帝国主义国家制度的罪恶与黑暗，使读者深刻地认识到美帝国主义的本质——不是“文明”，而是野蛮；后一篇文章则介绍了民主德国的一个翻身农民——彼得·曼，在土地改革后，分得土地房屋，建设着美满的家庭的幸福生活。使读者体会到在民主国家的人民是多么的幸福。用这样显明对比的方法进行宣传，不仅可以激发广大人民对帝国主义的仇恨，和对社会主义国家及人民民主国家的热爱，同时更可以清楚地指明为什么要反对帝国主义，为什么必须走人民民主和社会主义的道路。许多报刊虽也发表了一些这样的文章，但仍不够系统和具体。因此，我建议全国报刊多用事实对比的方法刊载这方面的文章、通讯，更会有助于深入抗美援朝运动和加强国防的宣传教育。
