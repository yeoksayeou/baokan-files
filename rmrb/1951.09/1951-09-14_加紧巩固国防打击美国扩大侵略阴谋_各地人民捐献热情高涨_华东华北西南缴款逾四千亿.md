The working class of Shanghai increased production to donate funds that have already reached 17.7 billion yuan by the 21st of last month, which can buy nearly twelve fighter planes and already accounts for more than 23% of the original donation plan (50 fighter planes). All employees of the Shanghai private Zhabei Hydropower Company decided to donate one fighter plane separately from the proceeds of increased production. Workers at the Nanjing private Shenchang Machinery Factory completed the patriotic production contract ahead of schedule and donated 50% of the bonuses earned. They have already paid over 4.28 million yuan, more than double the original plan. Workers at the Huaihe Salt Field in Subei District have already paid over 990 million yuan, completing two-thirds of the original donation plan. People from all walks of life in Su County Prefecture, Wanbei, have paid half of the original six-month donation plan. Among them, the people of Yongcheng County have overfulfilled the donation plan for one fighter plane.
    [Our Newspaper] People in various provinces and cities in North China, as well as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Shenyang, continue to donate funds to purchase weapons and carry out donation campaigns.

The total amount paid by the people of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, has reached over 9.317 billion yuan, close to completing the city's plan to donate six fighter planes and one anti-aircraft gun by the end of September (the city has pledged to donate a total of twelve fighter planes and one anti-aircraft gun). Moreover, since the continuous provocative incidents of the US aggressors sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, the enthusiasm of the city's people to support the front line has been even higher, and in the latter half of August, the payment reached over 2.7 billion yuan. Workers in Tangshan have pledged to donate three fighter planes, and the payment is close to the value of two planes.

The people of the city have now paid 21.2 billion yuan, reaching 38% of the total target of 38 fighter planes, and are currently striving with greater efforts to complete two-thirds of the total donation target before National Day. With great enthusiasm, the working class of the city responded to Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government's call to "increase production and save wealth equivalent to 5 million tons of grain"; and combined this task with the donation campaign, thereby improving technical level, improved business management, created more wealth for the country, and also ensured the completion of the donation plan. The number of payments made by workers in the city was 3,393,116,000 yuan. Farmers in the suburbs of the city increased their income by protecting seedlings, eliminating pests, raising chickens and pigs, and engaging in more sideline businesses, so that the donation plan could be completed.
