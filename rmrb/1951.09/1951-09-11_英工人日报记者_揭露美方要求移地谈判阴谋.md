Xinhua News Agency, September 9th—Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker" in London, reported from Kaesong on the 7th: From the action of American jet fighters diving over Kaesong today for a show of force, it can be seen that Ridgway is ready to make good on his boast that continuing negotiations in Kaesong "will inevitably lead to further interruptions of the negotiations." The purpose of this violation of the neutrality agreement is to support, with practical actions, the American conspiracy to sabotage the negotiations by proposing a new location for the armistice talks. This proposal is the fourth strategic move by the United States to make the negotiations impossible. The first was to present territorial demands at the meeting that the other side could not accept, while denying these demands outside the meeting. The second was to hide these demands in subcommittees when they began to leak out. The third was to bomb the Korean-Chinese delegation and launch shooting wars in the neutral zone when this trick was about to fail. Ridgway's new idea and the arrogant tone of his reply are, in fact, demanding that the Korean-Chinese side bear the responsibility for the American side's blatant act of sabotaging the meeting with bombs and machine guns, that the Korean-Chinese side, regardless of the conclusive evidence, politely say that the Americans are innocent, and that they bow to the insidious American demand to choose a new location. There is nothing wrong with Kaesong as the meeting place; what is wrong is the American intention. No matter where the negotiations are held, if the United States is not sincerely willing to stop the war based on the principles proposed by Malik, which the whole world considers fair and reasonable, there will be no result.

Xinhua News Agency, September 10th—Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker" in London, reported from Kaesong on the 9th: When Ridgway's planes and troops do not intrude, everything here is peaceful. The bustling little market in the center of the city is piled high with peaches and apples. Women and sun-tanned children sit on the riverbank washing clothes. Bearded old farmers and young women tend the sturdy yellow ears of grain and the tall purple sorghum. The patrolling police maintain order very well, and I can walk around the neutral zone without encountering any danger. But someone is telling the world that this small place is full of troops and tanks, and that fully armed "irregular forces" are still active at will. Every reason and rumor from the American side contradicts the previous one. Only one thing is absolutely certain: they have absolutely no sincerity in making the armistice negotiations a success.

### 英工人日报记者  揭露美方要求移地谈判阴谋

    揭露美方要求移地谈判阴谋
    【新华社九日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿七日自开城报道：从美国喷气战斗机今天在开城上空俯冲示威的行动中可以看见，李奇微已准备把他所吹嘘的继续在开城举行谈判“不可避免地会使谈判再遭中断”这句话兑现了。这次破坏中立协议的用意，是想以实际行动来支持美国这次提出的在新地址举行停战谈判的破坏谈判的阴谋。这个建议是美国使谈判无法进行的第四次战略行动。第一次是在会上提出对方不能接受的领土要求，同时又在会外否认有这种要求。第二次是当这种要求开始泄露时，把这些要求藏到小组委员会中。第三次是当这一手也眼看要失败了的时候，就轰炸朝中代表团，并在中立区内发动射击战。李奇微的新主意和他的复电所用的蛮横口吻，事实上是要求朝中方面承担美方明目张胆地以炸弹和机枪破坏会议的行径的责任，要朝中方面不管证据确凿，还是客客气气地说美国人没有罪，并且向美国选择新地址的阴险的要求低头。以开城为会址并没有任何错误，错的是美方的意图。不管到什么地方去谈判，如果美国不是真心诚意愿意依据马立克所提出而且全世界都认为公正合理的原则停战，那就什么结果都不会有。
    【新华社十日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿九日自开城报道：当李奇微的飞机和军队不来侵扰的时候，这里的一切都是和平的。城中心的热闹的小市场上，堆满了桃子和苹果。妇女和皮肤晒得黝黑的小孩子坐在河岸边上捣衣，蓄须的老农和青年妇女，照顾着茁壮的黄色的谷穗和高大的紫色的黍子。巡逻警察把秩序维持得极好，我可以在中立区内到处走动，不会遇到任何危险。但是却有人在向全世界说：这样一块小小的地方充满了军队和坦克，武装齐全的“非正规部队”仍在任意活动。美方的每一种理由和谣言都和以前矛盾，只有一件事是绝对肯定的，那就是他们完全没有使停战谈判成功的诚意。
