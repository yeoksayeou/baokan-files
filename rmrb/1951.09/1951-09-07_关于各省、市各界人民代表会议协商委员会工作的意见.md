    Opinions on the Work of People's Representative Conference Consultation Committees in Various Provinces and Cities
    (Adopted by the 25th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on July 19, 1951)

I. Among the provincial and municipal consultation committees that have contacted the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, some have begun to exercise the functions and powers of the local committees of the National Committee, some have initially established their own institutions, and have carried out the following aspects of work to varying degrees:
    1. Cooperate with the government in preparing for the People's Representative Conference.
    2. After the closing of the People's Representative Conference, organize the representatives to convey the resolutions of the representative conference to people from all walks of life in various ways, maintain regular contact with the representatives, accept their opinions, and collect the opinions of the people through them, and promptly reflect them to the People's Government.
    3. Review documents and draft laws submitted by the government for deliberation.
    4. Assist the government in mobilizing the people to participate in various movements, such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
    5. Initiate and promote the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages to conduct current affairs education and policy study.

The above activities have achieved considerable success and preliminary experience.

II. However, it should also be pointed out that, since the consultation committee is a new creation and lacks experience, some places are not familiar with it or do not attach enough importance to it, so it is inevitable that it becomes a formality and cannot play its due role well. The common shortcomings of the consultation committees in various places are the lack of regular and comprehensive work. Some have almost no work other than holding People's Representative Conferences and consultation committee meetings; although some have activities other than holding People's Representative Conferences and consultation committee meetings, they lack planning and initiative, and therefore lack regularity. Often, when things come to a head, they are very busy for a while, rush through it, and the activities are suspended again. Or, although there are some regular activities, the scope is not wide enough and the content is not rich enough. There are often more activities to cooperate with the government in promoting policies and laws, while there is insufficient initiative in contacting the people and reflecting the people's opinions and needs; there is more assistance to the government's work, while there is little unified front work to assist the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages in uniting and making progress.

It should also be pointed out that in some places, there are some incorrect or inappropriate views and practices regarding the relationship between the consultation committee and certain relevant parties, especially in the relationship with the government. For example, some local governments regard it as a subordinate organ of the government and issue instructions or orders to it. Some places regard the consultation committee as a representative body, and all the work that the government wants to do must be submitted to the consultation committee for approval or ratification. In addition, in some places, the work and meetings of the consultation committee are mixed up with the work and meetings of the government, or they handle the work of the government on its behalf, or they relax their own responsibilities. Furthermore, in some places, the relationship between the consultation committee and the local United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties and people's organizations is still somewhat unclear.

III. The main reason for the above problems is insufficient understanding, insufficient attention, or partial emphasis on the nature and role of the consultation committee. The consultation committee is a political consultation organ of the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages, and it is also a united front organization that unites the democratic classes through the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages. Therefore, the task of the consultation committee is, on the one hand, to assist the government in contacting and mobilizing the people, reviewing and promoting policies and laws; and on the other hand, to strengthen the work of uniting and promoting progress among the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages, and through them to unite and educate the people of the democratic classes. These two tasks are inseparable. If one aspect is missing, the task is not complete; if this aspect is missing, the work of the other aspect will not be done well. In its relationship with the People's Government, it should be clear that the consultation committee is not a political power organ, nor is it a subordinate organ of the government, but a consultation and suggestion organ. Its relationship with the government is a relationship of consultation, suggestion, and assisting the government in contacting the people and promoting work. In its relationship with the democratic parties and people's organizations, the consultation committee is not their leading organ, but their consultation and cooperation organ. It consults on all matters of common concern or mutual interest to the democratic parties and people's organizations, reaches agreements, and jointly promotes them, without interfering in their internal affairs. The relationship between the consultation committee and the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party is also a relationship of consultation and cooperation. The United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party will certainly do its best to assist the work and activities of the consultation committee.

IV. Based on the above understanding of the nature of the consultation committee and the actual experience of various places, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences in Provinces" and Article 10 of the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences in Cities," the work of the consultation committee is specifically listed as follows:
    1. Through the representatives of the People's Representative Conference and the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages, assist the People's Government in implementing the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference and understand their implementation.
    2. Through the representatives of the People's Representative Conference and the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages, assist the People's Government in contacting the people, soliciting and reflecting the people's opinions.
    3. Review documents and proposals submitted by the government for deliberation.
    4. Systematically collect materials on political law, finance and economy, culture and education, health, urban construction, religious affairs, and other aspects, conduct research, and put forward opinions for the government to adopt.
    5. Separately or jointly convene symposiums of people from all walks of life to assist the People's Government in explaining policies and laws and soliciting opinions on policies and laws.
    6. Accept the people's suggestions, inquiries, requests, appeals, and criticisms, and be responsible for handling them appropriately, ensuring that they are addressed and accounted for.
    7. Assist and promote the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages to participate in various people's revolutionary movements and construction work. At present, it is especially necessary to plan to organize work groups, visiting groups, inspection groups, etc., to participate in the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
    8. Organize current affairs seminars and study sessions to assist the representatives of the People's Representative Conference, the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages in learning about current affairs, policies, and theory.
    9. Assist the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages in solving mutually related problems and strengthening their unity and cooperation.
    10. Provide possible assistance to the development of the democratic parties and the training of cadres.
    11. Cooperate with the People's Government in preparing for the next People's Representative Conference.

The provincial and municipal consultation committees that exercise the functions and powers of the local committees of the National Committee shall also perform the tasks stipulated in the various clauses of Article 4 of the "Decision of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Local Committees."

In order to successfully complete the above work and tasks, the provincial and municipal consultation committees must appropriately improve their organization. At present, the institutions of some consultation committees are too incomplete and too inadequate, which is also one of the reasons for the lack of regular work. Therefore, the consultation committees in various places should establish and enrich secretariats (offices) and other institutions, equip full-time cadres, and establish various committees (such as: political law, finance and economy, urban construction, culture and education, health, religious affairs, etc.) according to the needs of local work, and absorb the participation of members of the consultation committee and representatives of the People's Representative Conference.

### 关于各省、市各界人民代表会议协商委员会工作的意见

    关于各省、市各界人民代表会议协商委员会工作的意见
    （一九五一年七月十九日中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会第二十五次会议通过）一、迄今已与人民政治协商会议全国委员会发生联系的省、市协商委员会中，有些已开始代行着全国委员会地方委员会的职权，有些已初步地建立起自己的机构，并或多或少地进行了下列各方面的工作：
    1、协同政府筹备人民代表会议。
    2、在人民代表会议闭幕之后，组织各代表以各种方式向各界人民传达代表会议的决议，经常与各代表联系，接受他们的意见，并经过他们搜集人民的意见，及时反映给人民政府。
    3、审议政府交议的文件和法案。
    4、协助政府动员人民参加各种运动，如抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命等等。
    5、发起并推动各民主党派、人民团体、民主人士进行时事教育和政策学习。以上的活动都获得相当的成绩和初步的经验。二、但也应该指出，由于协商委员会是一个新的创造，还没有多少经验，有些地方对它还不够熟悉，甚至不够重视，因而往往不免流于形式，不能够很好地发挥其应有的作用。各地协商委员会普遍存在的缺点，是缺乏经常的和全面的工作。有的除了举行人民代表会议和协商委员会的会议以外，几乎再没有什么工作；有的除举行人民代表会议和协商委员会会议外虽还有一些活动，但缺乏计划性与主动性，因而也就缺乏经常性，往往事到临头，大忙一阵，突击过去，活动又呈停顿。或则虽有些经常活动而范围不够宽广，内容不够丰富，往往对于配合政府推行政策法令这一方面的活动较多，而主动地联系人民，反映人民的意见和需要则不足；对于协助政府的工作较多，而对于协助各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士团结进步的统一 战线工作则很少。
    还应该指出，有些地方，对协商委员会和某些有关方面的关系上，特别在和政府的关系上，存在着若干不正确的或不恰当的看法和作法。如有的地方政府把它看成是政府的隶属机关，对它颁发指示或命令。有的地方把协商委员会看成代议机关，凡是政府要作的工作都要提交协商委员会通过或追认。又如有的地方协商委员会的工作和会议与政府的工作和会议搅在一起，或则代办了政府的工作，或则放松了本身的职责。此外，有些地方协商委员会在与当地中共统一战线工作部和各民主党派、人民团体的关系上，也还有些模糊不清。三、产生上述这些问题的主要原因是对于协商委员会的性质和作用认识不足，重视不够或有所偏重。协商委员会是各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士的政治协商机关，又是经过各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士去团结各民主阶级的统一战线组织。因此协商委员会的任务是一方面要协助政府联系和动员人民，审议和推行政策法令；又一方面要加强各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士的团结进步工作，经过他们去团结和教育各民主阶级的人民。这两方面的任务是不可分离的。缺了一个方面，任务就不完全；缺了这一方面，另一方面的工作也就做不好。在同人民政府的关系上，应该明确：协商委员会不是政权机关，也不是政府的隶属机关，而是协商、建议机关，它对政府的关系是协商、建议和协助政府联系人民推动工作的关系。在同各民主党派和人民团体的关系上，协商委员会不是它们的领导机关。而是它们的协商和团结合作的机关，协商各民主党派和人民团体的一切带共同性的或互相有关的事情，取得协议，共同推行，而不干涉它们的内部事务。协商委员会与中共统一战线工作部之间，也是协商和团结合作的关系，中共统一战线工作部自当尽量协助协商委员会的工作和活动。四、兹依据上面关于协商委员会的性质的了解和各地实际经验，按照省各界人民代表会议组织通则第九条和市各界人民代表会议组织通则第十条的规定，将协商委员会的工作具体列举如下：
    1、经过人民代表会议代表及各民主党派、人民团体、民主人士，协助人民政府实行各界人民代表会议的决议，并了解其执行情况。
    2、经过人民代表会议代表及各民主党派、人民团体、民主人士，协助人民政府联系人民，征求并反映人民意见。
    3、审议政府交议的文件和议案。
    4、有系统地搜集政治法律、财政经济、文教卫生、市政建设、宗教事务及其他方面的材料，进行研究，提出意见，供政府采择。
    5、分别地或联合地召集各界人士的座谈会，协助人民政府解释政策法令并征求对于政策法令的意见。
    6、接受人民的建议、询问、要求、申诉与批评，并负责加以适当的处理，务使有着落有交代。
    7、协助与推动各民主党派、人民团体、民主人士参加各种人民革命运动及建设工作。目前尤要有计划地组织工作团、参观团、视察团等，参加抗美援朝、土地改革及镇压反革命的三大运动。
    8、组织时事座谈会和学习会，协助人民代表会议代表、各民主党派、人民团体、民主人士进行时事的、政策的和理论的学习。
    9、协助各民主党派、人民团体、民主人士解决相互有关的问题，加强其团结与合作。
    10、对各民主党派的发展及训练干部等工作予以可能的协助。
    11、协同人民政府筹备下届各界人民代表会议。代行全国委员会地方委员会职权的省、市协商委员会，并须执行“中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会关于地方委员会的决定”第四条各款所规定的任务。省、市协商委员会为要很好地完成上述的工作和任务，必须适当地健全自己的组织。现在有些协商委员会的机构太不健全，太不充实，也是缺乏经常工作的原因之一。因此各地协商委员会应建立与充实秘书处（室）等机构，配备专职干部，并根据当地工作情况的需要，成立各种委员会（如：政治法律、财政经济、市政建设、文教卫生、宗教事务等），吸收协商委员会委员及各界人民代表会议的代表参加工作。
