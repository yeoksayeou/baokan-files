Editor's Note: Weak ideological leadership is the main shortcoming in current education work. Educational administrative leading organs at all levels are mostly busy with administrative affairs all day long, but lack a clear head on major issues concerning guidelines, policies, and educational thought, and have not spent enough time considering them. This deserves serious attention. The preliminary examination by the Education Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee on neglecting political and ideological nature is fruitful. It is hoped that responsible comrades of education administrative departments in major administrative regions, provinces, and cities can also conduct an in-depth examination in this spirit.

Education work is an activity in the ideological field, a process of cultivating talents for the construction of a new China, and the work of educating revolutionary descendants; its political and ideological nature is extremely prominent and rich. However, the Northwest Education Department, as the educational administrative leading organ in the Northwest region, has long been trapped in the quagmire of事務主義(事務主義), busy every day, entangled in the circle of administrative affairs, lacking a clear head on major policy issues and ideological issues related to education, failing to give them full consideration, serious research, and timely handling. It has done a very poor job in how to systematically and regularly carry out the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in schools at all levels, systematically transform and improve the thinking of teachers, students, and staff, actively carry out the United Front work of culture and education in the education sector, and enrich the political and ideological content of teaching materials in a timely manner in coordination with the development of revolutionary movements and national construction. Precisely because we have not grasped political and ideological issues tightly, political and ideological issues in schools at all levels still exist quite seriously today, two years after liberation.

Where is our 事務主義(事務主義) style manifested? The main thing is that our work lacks initiative and planning, dealing with whatever comes our way; we do not distinguish clearly enough between the size, importance, urgency, and priority of things; we grasp small problems tightly, and let go of big problems; we use our strength evenly, and our work lacks focus; there are deployments, but no inspections; things are done slowly and inefficiently; the system is not strict enough, and some things are shirked; the division of labor is not clear enough, and cadres are unevenly busy and idle; there is not enough contact between units, and official documents are often in transit; carelessness, a handicraft approach, and a guerrilla style still exist strongly. For example, the departmental affairs meeting is the highest decision-making body of the department, but it lacks political and ideological content. In the past six months, the Communist Party members held twenty departmental affairs meetings, discussing a total of seventy-five issues, of which only thirty-two were related to policy issues. The issues submitted by various offices to the departmental affairs meeting for resolution are mostly administrative and technical issues. Incoming and outgoing official documents should be a tool for reflecting the situation and guiding work, but they have not played their due role. Although the old "waiting for instructions" cliché has been broken, the content is generally empty and discusses matters in isolation, rarely mentioning policy or ideological principles to solve problems. Taking March of this year as an example, a total of 327 documents were issued, of which 268 were about general administrative matters, accounting for 81% of the total, and only 59 had policy and business guidance, accounting for 19% of the total. Since the beginning of this year, many reports have come from various places, but each unit is crying out that they do not have time to study them carefully. Many reports are locked in drawers and no one cares about them; some are answered with a few harmless words, and that is considered completing the task; some important issues are dragged on and on, so that they lose their timeliness. We have also constantly sent working groups down to understand the situation and discover problems, but they cannot see the big problems, and the small problems are not raised to the level of principles, and they can rarely provide valuable information as a basis for the leadership to guide the work. For example, Xi'an No. 1 Middle School in Shaanxi Province is a contact school designated by the Secondary Education Office. Personnel were sent to understand the teaching of Chinese language and political science, to participate in last year's year-end assessment, and to participate in the mobilization work of military cadre schools, but the reactionary thoughts of Tian Hanwen (Tian Hanwen is a Chinese language teacher at Xi'an No. 1 Middle School, who openly slandered the land reform and the leaders of the Chinese people in front of students, and colluded with a small number of reactionary teachers to attack progressive teachers, students, and school administrators. - Editor's note) were never discovered, and although there was some knowledge of the disunity between publicly funded students and self-funded students, it was always felt that the problem was not big, and the Shaanxi Culture and Education Department and the school were not assisted in solving it in a timely manner. Again, in March of this year, when the Xinjiang Culture and Education Department conducted a "major confidentiality inspection" in schools in Dihua City, it caused dissatisfaction among the masses because of deviations in the way it was carried out. When this happened, our working group was there, and they did not offer any opinions at the time, and did not report the true situation after returning to the department.

Due to the 事務主義(事務主義) style and 麻痺(麻痺) in political thought, we failed to adopt a serious attitude towards the serious political and ideological problems existing in school work, and to deal with them in a timely manner. This spring, a small number of reactionary elements in the Northwest Medical College opposed Communist Party members, Youth League members, and activists, and openly disrupted the order of the school. At that time, we adopted an insufficiently serious attitude towards this issue, which was a manifestation of a lack of political responsibility.

The farmer's cultural textbooks compiled by the Northwest Education Department were compiled in May 1950. The results of this inspection show that the political and ideological nature in farmer's cultural education is quite weak. The basic shortcoming is a purely literacy point of view, which is not combined with the political goals of the Party and the country today and tomorrow, and one-sidedly caters to some backward elements in the ideological consciousness of farmers. For example, the first lesson of the first book, "People," only mentions "people" and "farmers" in the text, and forgets the workers as the leading class. Although the following lessons mention things like "workers, farmers, workers work, farmers farm"... there is still a lack of ideological education with the working class as the leader and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation.

In encouraging farmers to work and produce, there is a lack of political and ideological guidance, and only a one-sided catering to the psychology of farmers to "get rich and satisfy the status quo," ignoring the correct relationship between production labor and national economic construction. Emphasizing personal and family interests, ignoring the collective interests of the country, such as "If you want to get rich, work hard," "If you want to live a good life, everyone works together to produce, there are many kinds of side businesses, if you want to get rich, don't be lazy," "If you want to get rich, hurry up and plant more trees." Another example is that the lesson "Strive for Production" is written like this: "...work hard in production all year round, you can't eat it all and you can't wear it all, the warm bed is really happy, men, women, old and young really like it." There is a lack of the idea that farmers actively advance under the leadership of the working class to build the motherland. (Although some revisions were made in the reprint, it is still not perfect.)

"Northwest Education Newsletter" is the guiding publication of the Northwest Education Department. The basic shortcoming of its content is that it is not closely enough linked to reality, and it often falls behind political and ideological movements. For example, the criticism of the "Wu Xun Spirit" has not been launched, which shows that we have not seriously organized discussion and criticism of this serious ideological issue.

The Northwest Education Department is the highest leading organ of education in the Northwest. Our main task is to guide education in the Northwest politically, ideologically, and professionally, and our weakness is precisely the weakness of political and ideological nature. For two years, we have deeply felt that our leadership cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation. If we do not catch up quickly, our work cannot be carried out.

What is the cause of 事務主義(事務主義)? There are certainly many objective reasons, but the main reason is that we lack sensitivity in politics and have no foresight about new things; the second is ideological laziness. When dealing with problems, most comrades avoid difficulties and choose ease, avoid the important and choose the light, unwilling to rack their brains and work hard, stopping after scratching the surface, and having a beginning but no end. The third is the lack of a complete and scientific working method. Although we are constantly thinking of ways and seeking improvements, we lack the spirit of implementing them to the end.

Tracing the ideological roots, we believe that the complacency of some veteran cadres and the sojourner mentality of new cadres, the empiricism of some veteran cadres and the formalism of new cadres, are all important factors that produce 事務主義(事務主義) and bureaucracy.

The improvement methods in the future: mainly to strengthen the study of political theory, improve the level of political thought, and implement the patriotic convention in the work to improve the working methods.

    为什么我们的教育工作搞不好？
    ——西北军政委员会教育部关于忽视政治性与思想性的初步检查
    编者按：思想领导薄弱是当前教育工作中的主要缺点。各级教育行政领导机关，多是成天忙于行政事务工作，对于有关方针政策和教育思想的重大问题，反而缺乏清醒的头脑，没有用足够的时间去加以考虑。这是值得严重注意的。西北军政委员会教育部关于忽视政治性与思想性的初步检查，是有收获的。希望各大行政区各省市教育行政部门负责同志也能本此精神，进行一次深入的检查。
    教育工作是思想领域的活动，是新中国建设人才的培育过程，是教育革命后代的工作；它的政治性和思想性是极为突出，极其丰富的。可是作为西北区教育行政领导机关的西北教育部，却长期陷在事务主义的泥坑里，每天忙忙碌碌，纠缠在事务行政的圈子里，对有关教育的重大政策问题和思想问题，缺乏清醒的头脑，未能加以充分的考虑，认真研究，及时处理。对如何有系统地经常地在各级学校里进行马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的宣传，有计划地改造和提高教职员生的思想，主动地在教育界开展文教统一战线工作，及时地配合革命运动和国家建设的发展情况，去充实教材的政治思想内容等等方面，都作得很差。正因为我们对政治思想问题抓的不紧，所以在解放两年后的今天，各级学校的政治思想问题还是相当严重地存在着。
    我们的事务主义作风表现在什么地方呢？主要是工作缺乏主动性和计划性，遇到什么，应付什么；事情的大小轻重、缓急先后，分得不够清楚；小的问题抓的紧，大的问题放的松；平均使用力量，工作缺乏重点；有布置，无检查；办事拖拖拉拉，工作效率不高；制度不够严密，有些事情互相推诿；分工不够明确，干部忙闲不均；各单位之间的联系不够，公文常在旅行；粗枝大叶、手工业方式和游击作风还浓厚的存在着。如部务会议是本部的最高决策机构，但缺少政治内容和思想内容。最近半年中共开过二十次部务会议，讨论的问题共七十五件，其中有关政策性的问题只有三十二件。各处提交部务会议解决的问题多半是些行政技术性的问题。来往公文应是反映情况指导工作的一种工具，可是没有发挥其应有的作用，旧的“等因奉此”的滥套虽然被打破了，可是内容一般是空空洞洞，就事论事，很少提到政策或思想原则上去解决问题。以今年三月为例，共发文三百二十七件，其中关于一般事务性的占二百六十八件，占总数的百分之八十一，带有政策性和业务指导性的只有五十九件，占总数的百分之十九。今年以来，各地的报告来得不少，而各单位却喊叫没有时间去认真研究。有许多报告被锁在抽屉里无人过问；有些则不关痛痒地批答几句，就算完成了任务；有些重要问题一拖再拖，以致失掉了时间性。我们也曾不断地派遣工作组下去了解情况，发现问题，但大的问题看不见，小的问题提不到原则上来，很少能提供有价值的资料，作为领导上据以指导工作的根据。如陕西省西安一中是中等教育处指定的联系校，曾派人去了解过语文教学、政治教学，参加过去年的年终鉴定和参加军事干部学校的动员工作，但对田汉文（田汉文是西安一中语文教员，在学生面前公开诬蔑土地改革，诬蔑中国人民领袖，并与少数思想反动的教员纠合一起，打击进步教员、学生和学校行政人员。——编者）等的反动思想始终未发觉，对公费生与自费生的不团结问题，虽略有所知，但总觉得问题不大，没有及时协助陕西文教厅和学校去解决。又如今年三月间，新疆文教厅在迪化市各学校进行“保密大检查”时，因为进行的方式方法有偏差，引起群众的不满。这件事情发生时，我们的工作团正在那里，他们当时既不提出意见，回部后又不汇报真实情况。
    由于事务主义的作风和政治思想上的麻痹，对学校工作中所存在的严重的政治思想问题，未能采取严肃认真的态度，及时加以处理。如今春西北医学院内有少数反动分子，反对共产党员和团员、积极分子，公然扰乱学校的秩序。当时我们对这个问题采取了不够认真的态度，这是缺乏政治责任心的表现。
    西北教育部编写的农民文化课本，系在一九五○年五月间编成，这次检查的结果，发现对农民文化教育中的政治性与思想性是相当薄弱的。基本缺点是一种纯识字观点，没有和党与国家的今天和明天的政治目标结合起来，片面地迁就农民思想意识中的某些落后成份。如第一册第一课“人”，在课文中仅提到“人民”和“农民”，而将作为领导阶级的工人忘记了。虽然以后的课文里提到了如“工人、农民、工人做工、农民种地”……但仍然缺少以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的思想教育。
    在鼓励农民劳动生产方面，缺乏政治思想的指导，而只是片面地迎合农民“发家致富，满足现状”的心理，忽视了生产劳动与国家经济建设的正确关系。强调个人与家庭利益，忽视了国家的集体利益，如“要想发家勤劳动”，“要想日子过得好，大家动手齐生产，各种副业多得很，要想发家没偷懒”，“要想发家致富，赶快多栽树木”。又如“努力生产”一课是这样写的：“……一年四季勤生产，吃不尽来穿不完，热炕真快活，男女老少真喜欢”。缺少农民在工人阶级的领导下积极前进建设祖国的思想。（在再版时虽曾作了某些修改，但仍不够完善。）
    “西北教育通讯”是西北教育部的指导刊物。它的内容的基本缺点是联系实际不够，往往落在政治思想运动的后面。如对“武训精神”的批判，一直没有展开，这说明我们对这一严重的思想问题，没有认真地去组织讨论和批判。
    西北教育部是西北教育事业的最高领导机关，我们的主要任务，是从政治上、思想上和业务上去指导西北的教育工作，而我们的工作弱点恰恰是政治性和思想性的薄弱。两年以来，我们已深深地感觉到我们的领导赶不上客观形势的发展，如不急起直追，我们的工作是无法开展的。
    事务主义产生的原因是什么呢？客观原因固然很多，但主要是由于我们在政治上缺乏敏感，对新事物没有预见；其次是思想上的怠惰，一般同志在处理问题时多是避难就易，避重就轻，不肯绞脑汁，下苦工，浅尝辄止，有头无尾。第三是缺乏一套完整的科学的工作方法，我们虽然不断地在想办法，求改进，但缺乏贯彻到底的精神。
    从思想根源上去追究，我们以为某些老干部的自满情绪和新干部的作客思想，某些老干部的经验主义和新干部的形式主义，都是产生事务主义和官僚主义的重要因素。
    今后的改进办法：主要是加强政治理论学习，提高政治思想水平，并在工作中贯彻爱国公约，改进工作方法。
