    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 12th: Our frontline reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are continuously annihilating large numbers of enemy effectives in blocking and counter-attack battles. From September 1st to 5th, the Korean-Chinese People's Army eliminated over 8,800 enemy troops. Among them, more than 4,200 were American troops and more than 4,500 were Rhee's puppet troops. During these five days, the Korean-Chinese People's Army also shot down or damaged 58 enemy aircraft in the skies over the front and rear. In order to cover up the disastrous defeats of the American invading army and Rhee's puppet army, Van Fleet issued a statement on the 4th, raving about his so-called "limited offensive" launched on the eastern front; but in reality, what he got was the death, injury, and capture of a large number of his soldiers, and this defeat continues to increase with the continuous adventurous attacks of the US-Rhee forces. The powerful Korean-Chinese People's Army continues to inflict heavy blows on the enemy on the line of mountains north of Yangkou and Linshui on the eastern front, and on the other hand, launches powerful local attacks on the western front. On the 5th, a certain unit of our army launched a local attack on the Deokseong-ri to Neunggok line west of Lianchuan. After four hours of heroic fighting, it annihilated most of the two companies of the US Cavalry First Division entrenched on the line, and routed and killed most of the enemy troops coming to support from Matian, Lianchuan. On the 6th, a certain unit launched a local attack on the Western Mountain and Douliu Peak line south of Pingkang. These two mountainous areas are the main peaks of the area the enemy boasted about as the "Iron Triangle Area". However, in a day and night of fierce fighting, the unit captured these two peaks and nearby highlands, and annihilated most of the two companies of American troops stubbornly resisting on the heights, killing and wounding more than 300 of them. In the battle, the unit also repulsed twelve fierce attacks by the enemy coming to support from Tieyuan and Jinhua, causing them heavy casualties. On the same day, another unit of our army launched a surprise attack on the Hyeonjeo and 338.1 high ground, 20 kilometers southwest of Tieyuan. In just one and a half hours of fierce fighting, it annihilated most of an American company that had invaded the area, killing and wounding more than 110 of them and capturing 11 enemy soldiers. Our army also eliminated many enemy troops in local attacks in other areas.

    中朝部队不断进行阻击战与反击战
    五天歼敌八千八百余名
    在前线后方共毁伤敌机五十八架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军不断在阻击战与反击战中大量歼灭敌人有生力量。自九月一日到五日，朝中人民军队又歼灭敌军八千八百余名。其中美军占四千二百余名，李伪军占四千五百余名。在这五天中，朝中人民军队并在前线与后方的上空击落击伤敌机五十八架。为掩饰美国侵略军和李伪军的惨重败绩，范佛里特曾在四日发表声明，狂吠其在东线发动的所谓“有限攻势”；但他在实际上所得到的是其大批士兵的死伤和被俘，而且这种败绩随着美李军的不断冒险进攻而在继续增加。强大的朝中人民军队一面在东线杨口、麟蹄以北的一线山头上继续痛击敌军，另一面在西线举行有力的局部攻击。五日，我军某部向涟川以西德寺里至陵谷一线进行局部攻击，经四小时英勇战斗，将盘踞该线的美军骑兵第一师两个连大部歼灭，并击溃和大部杀伤了由涟川麻田出援的敌军。六日，某部又向平康以南的西方山、斗流峰一线进行局部攻击。这两个山地是敌人夸耀为“铁三角地区”的主要高峰。但在一昼夜的激战中，该部攻克了这两个高峰及其附近高地，并将据险顽抗的美军两个连大部歼灭，杀伤其三百余人。在战斗中该部并击溃由铁原、金化来支援的敌人的十二次猛攻，使其遭受重大的伤亡。同日，我军另部猛袭铁原西南二十公里的岘低和三三八点一高地，仅历一个半小时的激战，就将侵入该地的美军一个连大部歼灭，计杀伤其一百十余名，俘敌十一名。我军在其他地区的局部攻击中也歼灭了很多敌军。
