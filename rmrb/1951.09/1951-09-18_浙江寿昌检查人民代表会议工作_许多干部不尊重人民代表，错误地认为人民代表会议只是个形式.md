    Zhejiang Shouchang Inspects People's Representative Conference Work
    Many Cadres Disrespect People's Representatives, Erroneously Believing the People's Representative Conference is Just a Formality
    In order to strengthen the construction of democratic power and strive to have the Shouchang County All-Circles People's Representative Conference exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress in the second half of the year, the Shouchang County People's Government of Zhejiang Province and the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of the county, starting from August 19, combined the study of Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "Speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality" with an inspection of the work of the People's Representative Conference over the past year.
    Shouchang County was liberated in May 1949. From October of the same year to August of this year, a total of five county-level People's Representative Conferences of all circles have been held. The results of these conferences, in addition to further strengthening the unity of people from all strata, strengthening the ties between the government and the people, and correcting the undemocratic work style of cadres, the greatest gain was the implementation of the government's policies and the removal of ideological concerns among the masses in the new district such as "fear of a second land reform," "fear of standing out," and "fear of borrowing without repaying." However, the county found in this inspection that some cadres, especially cadres at the district and township levels, have not regarded the People's Representative Conference as a basic national system, and there are narrow views and purely utilitarian views, disrespecting the People's Representatives, mistakenly believing that the People's Representative Conference is just a formality. For example, Yang Ziyu, Deputy District Chief of Datong District, reviewed, "In the past, we did not pay attention to representatives, and felt that convening the People's Representative Conference was a matter for the county People's Government and had nothing to do with us." Some cadres reviewed, "In the past, I always thought that we could complete the task without these representatives. A hundred sentences from the representatives are not as useful as one sentence from us." These cadre comrades were also unwilling to participate in the People's Representative Conference when they became representatives. On average, one-third of the cadre representatives were absent from each meeting. They rarely studied documents on political power construction on weekdays. The district chiefs of each district only read Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "Speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality" because they were going to report to the county this time.
    Because these erroneous ideological understandings existed among the cadres, and the leading comrades of the county did not promptly check and correct them, there were many shortcomings in the county's People's Representative Conference: First, more representatives were designated than elected, and more township cadres served as representatives. Before and after the election of representatives and the convening of meetings, there was little publicity and education to the masses. Therefore, many people still do not know what the People's Representative Conference is for, and do not care about or value the People's Representative Conference. Some people are unwilling to be representatives, such as the carpenters and blacksmith representatives in Datong District who said, "We have to work and don't have time to be representatives." Therefore, one-half of the county's representatives are ineffective. Second, more tasks are assigned to representatives at the People's Representative Conference, and fewer problems raised by the masses are solved. The county, district, and township People's Governments rarely contact representatives on weekdays to help them convey and implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference. The District Chief of Genglou District said in his review: "In the past, the district leaders never helped the representatives to implement the spirit of the meeting. Representatives with a strong sense of responsibility can actively contact the district, while those without a strong sense of responsibility just go home and that's it." In addition, individual cadres arbitrarily detained and controlled People's Representatives. For example, Shiping Township in Hangtou District controlled the enlightened gentry Cheng Shougen, a People's Representative, in the same way as other landlords (Editor's Note: This is an illegal act that violates the personal rights of the People's Representative and should be checked and corrected; if the situation is serious, the cadres who made the mistake should be disciplined).
    The county believes that in order to hold a good People's Representative Conference in the future, the leadership must pay attention to it, strengthen democratic education for cadres and the masses, select representatives well, and respect the opinions of the representatives, seriously and responsibly handle proposals, and help representatives convey and implement resolutions.

    浙江寿昌检查人民代表会议工作
    许多干部不尊重人民代表，错误地认为人民代表会议只是个形式
    浙江省寿昌县人民政府和该县中共县委会为了加强民主政权建设工作，争取在下半年使县各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权，从八月十九日开始结合刘少奇副主席“在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话”一文的学习，检查了一年多来人民代表会议的工作。
    寿昌县于一九四九年五月解放，自同年十月到今年八月共召开了五次县各界人民代表会议。这些会议召开的结果，除已进一步加强各阶层人民的团结，密切了政府与人民的联系，纠正了干部不民主的作风外，最大的收获是贯彻了政府的政策，解除了新区群众“怕第二次土地改革”、“怕冒尖”和“怕有借无还”等思想顾虑。但是该县在这次检查中发现，有些干部，特别是区乡两级干部还没有把人民代表会议当成国家的基本制度，存在着狭隘观点和单纯使用观点，不尊重人民代表，错误地以为人民代表会议只是个形式。如大同区副区长杨子余检讨说：“过去我们不重视代表，觉得召开人民代表会议是县人民政府的事，与咱没有关系。”有的干部检讨说：“过去，我总是认为没有这些代表一样完成任务，代表说一百句，还不如我们说一句管事。”这些干部同志当了代表，也不愿去参加人民代表会议，每次会议平均有三分之一的干部代表缺席。他们平日很少学习政权建设的文件，各区区长因为这次要去县汇报，才看了一下刘少奇副主席“在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话”。
    由于干部中存在着这些错误的思想认识，而该县领导同志也没有及时检查纠正，因此该县人民代表会议有不少缺点：第一，代表指定的多，选举的少，乡干部当代表的多。在选举代表和召开会议前后，很少向群众进行宣传教育。因此许多群众还不知道人民代表会议是干什么的，对人民代表会议不关心，不重视。有的人不愿意当代表，如大同区的木匠和铁匠代表说：“我们要做工，没工夫当代表。”所以，该县全部代表中有二分之一不起作用。第二，在人民代表会议上向代表布置任务的时候多，群众提出来的问题解决得少。县、区、乡人民政府平日很少和代表联系，帮助他们传达和贯彻人民代表会议的决议。更楼区区长在检讨中说：“过去区领导同志从来没有帮助代表去贯彻过会议精神。责任心比较强的代表能主动和区联系，责任心不强的回家就算了。”此外，个别干部随便扣押管制人民代表，如航头区石屏乡就将人民代表开明士绅程寿根同其他地主一样管制起来（编者按：这是一种侵犯人民代表人身权利的违法行为，应予检查纠正；若情况严重时，应给犯错误的干部以处分）。
    该县认为今后要开好人民代表会议，必须领导上重视，加强对干部和群众的民主教育，选好代表，并应尊重代表的意见，认真负责处理提案，帮助代表传达和贯彻决议。（张文楷）
