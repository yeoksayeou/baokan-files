    Strive to fulfill the task of accumulating wealth for the country in excess!
    Many enterprises in Shenyang actively exploit potential capabilities
    Workers in Shenyang are actively responding to Comrade Gao Gang's call at the Urban Work Conference of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at the end of May, mobilizing all forces, exploiting industrial potential, and striving to fulfill the political task of accumulating wealth for the country in excess. Since June, they have been conducting major quality inspections, combining increased production with donation-based patriotic pledges, investigating the potential capabilities of enterprises, making careful calculations, and proposing goals. Currently, most enterprises have successively formulated plans for increasing production and practicing thrift. Due to major quality inspections, improvements in the political and technical levels of employees, and improvements in enterprise management, the industrial potential is being continuously discovered and organized into a huge material force, greatly enhancing employees' confidence in completing the plans for increasing production and practicing thrift.
    After the Second Machine Tool Plant's plan for increasing production and practicing thrift was assigned by the higher authorities, some employees lacked confidence, believing that the higher authorities' assigned tasks were not based on actual conditions, the requirements were too high, and it was impossible to complete them. Later, leading cadres organized forces to conduct in-depth investigations and first discovered that the machine utilization rate was only 54%, and there was still huge untapped potential; the utilization rate of a certain furnace in the sixth workshop of the plant was only 67%. Simply the potential of this machine utilization rate, if fully utilized, could increase production and save 5,000 tons of grain. Secondly, in the first workshop of the Second Machine Tool Plant, it was discovered that many parts left over from last year's gantry planer, two-ton steam hammers that should have been installed but were not, wheel bands that had been made but not yet put into storage, and four tons of copper tiles that were over-received for fear of producing defective products, etc., were found to have accumulated capital equivalent to 14,000 tons of grain. It was also found that the scrap rate was very high, and the machine processing workshop wasted more than 10,000 machine-hours per month (machine-hour means one machine working for one hour); the reserve of materials and stagnant materials in the warehouse exceeded the quota by 30%. Once these potentials were discovered and mastered by the masses, the plant's plan for increasing production and practicing thrift exceeded the original plan by two-thirds. Another example is the Smelting Plant: Due to in-depth study of the spirit of the Urban Work Conference and serious learning from the advanced experience of the May 3rd Factory, the ideological leadership of employees was strengthened, and employees were mobilized to conduct in-depth investigations and careful accounting, enabling employees to find ways to exploit potential capabilities. For example, the copper blast furnace tuyere group discussed the method of completing increased production and thrift: First, control the furnace temperature; second, stabilize the wind pressure and air volume; third, prevent air leaks, backdraft, and poor ventilation. Doing the above three points well can increase the metal recovery rate, reduce costs, and ensure safe production without accidents, and overfulfill the group's plan to increase production and save 320 tons of grain. Furthermore, careful accounting made employees clear about how much the quality of various products would be improved, how much the quantity would be increased, and how much the cost would be saved, which would increase the wealth of the country, making the action goals of each employee clear and giving them a direction to exert their efforts. Therefore, after more than a month of deliberation, education, investigation, careful accounting, and plant-wide discussions from top to bottom and from bottom to top on the plan for increasing production and practicing thrift, all employees of the plant signed a collective contract in mid-August, guaranteeing to overfulfill the task of 115,900 tons.
    After the above efforts, many enterprises have begun to make preliminary achievements. For example, the working capital of the Second Machine Tool Plant has been reduced by 10 billion yuan in July. The turnover period of working capital in the Sixth Paper Mill in July has decreased from 92 days (June) to 76.8 days, and it is planned that the average turnover period for the whole year will be reduced from 144.8 days in 1950 to 99.4 days this year; the first-grade products in the paper-making workshop of the plant have been increased from 76% to 100%; the machine utilization rate of the second branch of the plant has been increased by 7.2%. The residual carbon rate of cylinder oil in the Chemical Plant has been reduced from 6.2% to 5.113%. The oil content of soap in the Hydrogenated Oil Plant has been reduced from 52% to 32%. The rebar products of the Eighth Machine Tool Plant have been improved from 35% reserved products to 100% qualified products. The Smelting Plant has overcome technical equipment difficulties and has begun to produce refined copper. These all show that once the potential capabilities in industry are discovered and mastered by the working masses, they become a huge material force.
    The discovery and exploitation of these great industrial potential and the creativity of workers in Shenyang are carried out on the basis of gradual establishment of democratic reforms and new enterprise management systems, improvement of the political and technical levels of employees, and gradual improvement of working conditions and material life. The reason why these potential capabilities can be rapidly developed into huge material forces in enterprises is: first, because enterprise leaders have carried out extensive and in-depth ideological mobilization, making the vast number of employees understand the great political significance of over-fulfilling the task of 5 million tons of grain for the country in consolidating national defense, developing the economy, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, thereby stimulating the patriotic labor enthusiasm, creativity, and initiative of the vast number of employees, and organizing them into specific action plans in a timely manner. This is the result of the close and vivid combination of political work and economic work in enterprises. Second, enterprise leaders have conducted in-depth investigations and research, made careful calculations, discovered the potential capabilities in enterprises, and mobilized employees to repeatedly study the methods of realizing the plan from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and recognized the specific goals of the struggle of all employees. Third, the advanced work methods of Kovalev are promoted in enterprises, technical management and the work of sections and offices are improved, technical personnel are organized to go deep into the site to integrate the advanced operating experience of workers, improve the technical and theoretical level of workers, and strictly implement technical operating procedures. Fourth, the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests in the enterprise management, and the collective contract system, make the development of production and the improvement of workers' working conditions and material life correctly combined, thereby promoting and maintaining the continuous upsurge of labor enthusiasm.
    However, at present, the work of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in organizing employees to exploit the huge potential capabilities of industry is only in the initial stage. At present, there are still many ideological concerns among employees, and they lack experience. For example, if they want to exploit potential capabilities, they do not know where to start? What is the core of the plan for increasing production and practicing thrift? How to correctly combine many current tasks? Therefore, it is necessary to further mobilize the masses, dispel ideological concerns, conduct detailed investigations and planning, and closely integrate them with various current tasks, so that the potential of industry can be better exploited and more effectively transformed into a material force.

    为给国家完成超额积累的任务而斗争！
    沈阳许多企业积极发挥潜在能力
    沈阳工人积极响应高岗同志五月末在中共中央东北局城市工作会议上的号召，正动员一切力量，发挥工业潜在能力，为给国家超额积累财富的政治任务而斗争。他们从六月份开始，经过质量大检查，结合增产捐献订立爱国公约，调查企业潜在能力，精打细算，提出奋斗目标，到目前多数企业已先后订出增产节约计划。由于多数企业经过了质量大检查，和职工政治、技术、水平的提高，企业管理的改进，工业潜在能力正在不断地被发掘与被组织成为巨大的物质力量。大大地增强了职工完成增产节约计划的无限信心。
    机器二厂增产节约计划由上级分配后，部分职工缺乏信心，认为上级分配任务不根据实际情况，要求太高，无法完成。后来领导干部组织力量深入调查，首先发现：机器运转率只达百分之五十四，尚有巨大潜力没有发挥；该厂第六车间的某种炉运用率也只发挥了百分之六十七。单是这种机器运用率的潜力，如能充分发挥，就能增产节约五千吨粮食。其次，在机器二厂第一车间，发现生产过程中积压了许多去年作龙门刨剩余部件，和应装而未装的二吨汽锤，及已作好而尚未入库的轮带，以及为怕出废品而多领的四吨铜瓦等等，合计积压资金一万四千吨粮食。又发现废品率很高，机器加工车间每月浪费一万多台时（台时即一台机器工作一小时）；仓库中储备材料和呆滞材料，超过定额百分之三十。这些潜力一经发掘并为群众所掌握，该厂增产节约计划，便超过了本厂第一次原计划三分之二。再如冶炼厂：由于深入研究城市工作会议精神，和认真学习五三工厂先进经验，加强了职工思想领导，和发动职工深入调查算细账，使职工找到了发挥潜在能力的方法。如铜鼓风炉鼓风口组讨论完成增产节约方法是：第一要控制炉温；第二稳定风压风量；第三要防空风、防里风口、防通风不良。作好以上三点，就可提高金属回收率，降低成本，和保证安全生产不出事故，与超额完成该组增产节约三百二十吨粮食的计划。再则，由于算细账，使职工明确了各类产品质量提高多少，数量增加多少，成本节约多少，就可以给国家增加多少财富，使每个职工行动目标明确，摸到了使劲的方向。因之，该厂经过一个多月的酝酿教育、调查、算细账、全厂从上而下和从下而上的讨论研究增产节约计划，全厂职工并于八月中旬签订了集体合同，保证超额完成十一万五千九百吨任务。
    经过了以上种种努力，许多企业已开始做出了初步成绩。如机器二厂七月份流动资金已减少一百亿元。造纸六厂七月份流动资金周转期已由九十二天（六月份）降为七十六点八天，并计划全年平均周转期由一九五○年的一百四十四点八天，今年降为平均九十九点四天；该厂抄成车间，一级品已由百分之七十六，提高到百分之百；该厂二分厂机器运转率，已提高百分之七点二。化工厂汽缸油残炭率，已由百分之六点二降至百分之五点一一三。硬化油厂肥皂含油量，由百分之五十二降至百分之三十二。机器八厂的盘条产品，由百分之三十五保留品，已提高为百分之百合格品。冶炼厂克服了技术设备困难，已开始出产精铜。这些都说明了工业中潜在能力一经发掘和为工人群众所掌握便变为巨大的物质力量。
    这些伟大工业潜在能力与工人创造力的发掘与发挥，在沈阳是经过了民主改革与企业新管理制度逐渐建立，和职工政治、技术、水平的提高，以及劳动条件、物质生活逐渐改善的基础上进行的。这些潜在能力在企业中所以能迅速发挥成为巨大物质力量，第一是由于企业领导干部进行了广泛深入的思想动员，使广大职工了解为国家超额完成五百万吨粮食任务，对巩固国防、发展经济、巩固工农联盟、巩固人民民主专政的重大政治意义，从而激发了广大职工的爱国劳动热情，和创造性与积极性，并及时加以组织成为具体的行动计划。这是企业中政治工作与经济工作紧密生动地结合的结果。第二是由于企业领导干部进行了深入的调查研究，精打细算，发掘企业中的潜在能力，并发动职工从上而下和从下而上地反覆研究实现计划的方法，认清全体职工奋斗的具体目标。第三是由于企业中推广郭瓦廖夫的先进工作方法，改进技术管理与科、室工作，组织技术人员深入现场综合工人先进操作经验，提高工人的技术理论水平和严格贯彻技术操作规程。第四是企业管理方面贯彻了公私兼顾的奖励政策和集体合同制，使发展生产与改善工人劳动条件和物质生活正确地结合起来，从而推动与保持劳动积极性的不断高涨。
    但目前沈阳市总工会组织职工发挥工业巨大潜在能力的工作，还仅在开始的阶段。目前职工中还存在着许多思想顾虑，而且缺乏经验，如要发挥潜在能力不知应从何下手？增产节约计划不知抓住什么中心？当前许多工作不知如何正确结合？因之，还得更深入地发动群众，打消思想顾虑，细密地调查、计划，使与当前的各种工作紧密地结合起来，才能使工业潜在力更好地发挥，更有效地变为物质力量。（张力克）
