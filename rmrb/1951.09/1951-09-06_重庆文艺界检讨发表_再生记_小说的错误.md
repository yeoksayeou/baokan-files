    Chongqing Literary and Art Circles Conduct Self-Criticism Regarding the Publication of the Novel "Regeneration"
    The "Xinhua Literature and Art" supplement, issue number seven (published in the Chongqing "Xinhua Daily" on August 19th), edited by the Chongqing branch of the All-China Federation of Literary Workers Associations, published three articles containing self-criticism and criticism regarding the reactionary novel "Regeneration." The self-criticism article from the Chongqing "Xinmin Daily" editorial department pointed out that, due to the editorial department's low political and ideological level and insufficient attention to the seriousness of the people's news undertaking, it had opened up a market for the sale of counter-revolutionary literature. Ai Wu's "Our Self-Criticism" from the Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles (FLAC) pointed out the serious situation of the FLAC's lack of ideological leadership over literary and artistic creation: Liu Sheng'ya, the author of "Regeneration," was a staff member of the FLAC, and the leading comrades of the FLAC not only did not read his novel beforehand, but even did not bother to take a look at it after the novel was published. As a result, during the high tide of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, a novel defending counter-revolutionary elements was serialized for two or three months. The "Xinhua Literature and Art" editor's article "Discussion on 'Regeneration'" summarized the situation of carrying out mass literary and artistic criticism of "Regeneration" and solemnly pointed out: This criticism has made us even more painfully aware that Chongqing's literary and art circles have not made enough efforts in literary and artistic criticism. In the future, we must mobilize and organize the broad masses to carry out literary and artistic criticism work. Only by resolutely implementing the mass line on the literary and artistic front can we improve the ideological level of literary and artistic criticism and push literary and artistic work forward. The extremely lax ideological errors of the Chongqing literary and artistic circles and their experiences and lessons should arouse the vigilance and attention of literary and artistic workers throughout the country.

    重庆文艺界检讨发表“再生记”小说的错误
    中华全国文学工作者协会重庆市分会主编的副刊“新华文艺”第七期（载八月十九日重庆“新华日报”）登载了三篇有关反动小说“再生记”的检讨和批评的文章。重庆“新民报”编辑部的检讨文章指出由于编辑部政策、思想水平低，对待人民新闻事业的严肃性重视不够，以致替反革命文学开辟了贩卖市场。重庆市文联艾芜同志的“我们的检讨”一文指出了文联对文艺创作缺乏思想领导的严重情况：“再生记”的作者刘盛亚是文联机关的工作人员，文联的领导同志不仅在事先未看他的小说，甚至在小说发表之后连看都不曾看一下。以致在镇压反革命运动的高潮当中，使为反革命分子辩护的小说连载两三月之久。“新华文艺”编者“关于‘再生记’的讨论”一文总结了对“再生记”展开群众性文艺批评的情况，并且严正地指出：由这次批评，更痛感到重庆文艺界对文艺批评工作的努力不够。今后必须发动和组织广大群众进行文艺批评工作，只有在文艺战线上坚决贯彻群众路线，才能提高文艺批评的思想水平，把文艺工作向前推进一步。重庆文艺界思想极端麻痹的错误和他们的经验教训应该引起全国各地文艺工作者的警惕和注意。
