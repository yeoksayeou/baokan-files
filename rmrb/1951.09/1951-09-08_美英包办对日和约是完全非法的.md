The US-UK-brokered Peace Treaty with Japan is Completely Illegal

III. The Performance of the US and UK in the War Against Japan

Prior to the "Pearl Harbor Incident" on December 7, 1941, the US and UK were in fact accomplices of the Japanese aggressors. After December 7, 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the US and UK were forced to join the war against Japan, but their actions were consistently unenthusiastic. It was not until around the time the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan with its military forces that the United States, as a means, used atomic bombs to massacre the peaceful people of Japan, stealing the fruits of victory in order to end the war under conditions favorable to US imperialism.

(I) The US and UK Were Accomplices of the Japanese Aggressors

Because the US and UK consistently attempted to use Japan as an anti-Soviet gendarme in the East and as a vanguard for imperialist aggression against China, they politically appeased and compromised with Japan after it launched its war of aggression against China on September 18, 1931, in order to satisfy its aggressive ambitions. At the same time, they provided Japan with financial, economic, and strategic material assistance. This approach by the US and UK greatly fueled Japan's aggressive arrogance and strengthened its aggressive power.

Regarding Japan's occupation of Northeast China, the basic attitude of the US and UK at the time was to "recognize Japan's interests in Manchuria" (Lytton Commission Report) and to instruct China's traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government to implement a "policy of non-resistance." At the time, US Ambassador to Japan Forbes, in a "memorandum" delivered to Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara, stated: "The Government of the United States... has advised the Chinese Government to take a compromise step, and recognizes the proposal of the Executive Yuan (referring to the 'League of Nations' Executive Yuan) as part of the basis...." At the time, US Ambassador to the UK Dawes even defended Japanese aggression, saying: "In order to protect the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents, it is only natural and unavoidable for Japan to send troops to Manchuria." In 1932, when Japan attacked Shanghai during the "January 28th Incident," the US and UK, in conjunction with France and Italy, recognized Japan's freedom of action in Northeast China, instructed the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government to accept the terms of a ceasefire and troop withdrawal, and concluded the "Shanghai Truce Agreement," which damaged Chinese sovereignty.

The purpose of the US and UK governments at the time was extremely clear: to sacrifice Northeast China to encourage Japan's attack on the Soviet Union, and at the same time to hope that Japan's aggressive actions would stop in Northeast China, in order to facilitate their monopoly of the Chinese mainland. Therefore, after Japan occupied Jinzhou on January 2, 1932, US Secretary of State Stimson sent the so-called "Non-Recognition Doctrine" note to both China and Japan on January 7 of the same month. This "Non-Recognition Doctrine" was not actually opposed to Japan's aggression against China, but rather to prevent Japan from hindering American aggressive interests. The US State Department's supplementary statement released on January 8 of the same year for the Stimson Note made it very clear: "(1) The United States has no intention whatsoever of interfering with Japan's legal treaty rights in Manchuria; (2) It does not intend to interfere with Japan's resolution of any incidents, but these incidents must not damage American rights...."

The US and UK's financial and material support for Japan's war effort was one of the main driving forces behind Japan's war. Lenin pointed out in 1920: "Japan has the possibility of plundering the countries of the East, the countries of Asia, but without the assistance of other countries, it does not have the financial and military independence." The historical facts of Japan's aggression against China and various Asian countries have proven the correctness of Lenin's scientific conclusion.

After Japan occupied Northeast China, the United States, under the pretext that "an embargo on arms is not beneficial to China," gradually increased its exports of war materials to Japan. After the Chinese people launched a full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan on July 7, 1937, the United States used the "cash-and-carry" law to facilitate assistance to Japan, while restricting China from purchasing American arms. Because at that time, the Chinese coast had been armed and blockaded by the Japanese Navy, "carry" was completely impossible for China. For Japan, the United States purchased raw materials such as gold, silver, and raw silk plundered from China, so that Japan could obtain huge amounts of foreign exchange to "cash-and-carry". According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, in 1931, Japan's imports from the United States accounted for 27.7 percent of its total imports, and by 1939, according to statistics from the US Department of Commerce, US exports to Japan had increased to 48 percent of Japan's total imports. War materials accounted for the majority of US exports to Japan, and their proportion increased year by year. In 1937, war materials in US exports to Japan accounted for 53 percent, in 1938 it increased to 63 percent, and in the first nine months of 1939 it increased again to 71 percent. From January 1937 to September 1940, the total value of US war materials exported to Japan was more than 650 million US dollars. As for the UK, although it was slightly inferior to the US in this regard, it also did its best. In 1939, for example, war materials exported by the British Empire to Japan accounted for 22.12 percent of Japan's total imports of war materials.

Every dollar or pound earned by the US and UK from each batch of war materials assisted to Japan was stained with the blood of the Chinese people who resisted Japan, and after the Pearl Harbor incident, Japan used these war materials to carry out the massacre of the peoples of the US, the UK and Southeast Asia.

The US and UK were such accomplices in Japan's acts of aggression.

Moreover, the US and UK, during that long period when the Chinese people were fighting the War of Resistance Against Japan alone, constantly conspired to ruin the Chinese people's struggle to defend their national independence, in order to ease the contradictions between them and Japan in the struggle to dominate Asia. This shameless practice of the US and UK reached its peak between 1940 and 1941, due to Japan's active deployment to advance southward. In July 1940, the British Churchill government accepted Japan's demands and announced the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road, China's external passage in the southwest, for three months, "prohibiting the transportation of ordnance, munitions, gasoline, automobiles, and railway equipment." In December 1940, the United States began secret negotiations with Japan on the so-called "adjustment of US-Japan relations." According to the diary of Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe at the time: The United States stated in this negotiation that it could "advise" the "'Chiang regime' to merge with the 'Wang regime'," and have the US-Chiang "recognize Manchukuo" in exchange for Japan's guarantee of "not advancing southward by force." At the same time, for the strategic materials in the Southwest Pacific that Japan hoped to obtain, "the United States should provide assistance and support."

The US conspiracy and the contradictions between the US and Japan are very obvious. The US hoped to jointly control China and share special rights in the Pacific with Japan on the premise that Japan actively opposed the Soviet Union, while Japan wanted to monopolize Asia and refused to give in. As a result, the US policy of compromise was exchanged for Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

(II) Weak in the War Against Japan, Speculating and Taking Advantage

After the US and UK were forced to join the war against Japan on December 7, 1941, their performance throughout the entire war was characterized by weak combat, speculation, and various pretexts to deceive the world's people and shirk combat burdens. This inglorious performance of the US and UK is completely incomparable with the loyal efforts and brilliant contributions of China and the Soviet Union in the war.

In the first few days of the war, the US and UK suffered heavy losses due to Japan's surprise attack. This was a natural result of the long-term appeasement and compromise of the US and UK with Japan. From December 1941 to June 1942, the US and UK forces retreated steadily, allowing Japan to sweep across half of the Pacific in half a year and obtain abundant war materials to continue and expand its war of aggression.

From December 1941 to June 1943, during this year and a half, the US and UK, except for making a defense against Japan's eastward advance at Midway Island in the Pacific, did not engage in any more serious battles with Japan. Marshall, in his two-year (1943-1945) report during his tenure as Chief of Staff of the US Army, had to admit: "In all conscience, we Americans did very little to solve the difficulties at that critical time (referring to 1942)."

Of course, the US and UK also tried to explain to the world's people that their weak combat at that time was because they were "concentrating on dealing with the European war" (see Marshall's two-year report mentioned above), but in fact they did everything possible to delay the opening of the second front in Europe. Obviously, the so-called "concentrating on dealing with the European war" is completely self-deception. The US and UK cannot shirk the blame for their weak combat in the early stages of the war.

The United States has made a great fanfare about its "island-hopping" offensive in the Pacific and its "air operations" against Japan. This is also a kind of "air and sea superiority" theory that the United States has always exaggerated. But in fact, the actual effect of this air and sea offensive in the war against Japan was very limited.

Regarding the "island-hopping offensive," Marshall himself said: "In the early days, our offensive against Japanese-occupied areas was slow and painful. To Americans, if we had to fight as bloody as on the Papuan coast of New Guinea or on Guadalcanal, using what is commonly called the 'island-hopping tactic' to fight the Japanese, it seemed that it would take many years."

(See the two-year report quoted above) As for the effect of the "air operations"? The US air raids on Japan were only carried out on a larger scale continuously after March 1945, and according to the report of the US Strategic Bombing Survey, the extent of the damage to Japan's military industry due to air raids was extremely slight. Taking steel production as an example, the damage to milled iron production was only 3 to 5 percent, open-hearth steel ingots only 2 percent, and steel plates 1 percent. According to the statistics released by the Japanese Army Ministry and Navy Ministry, the number of aircraft owned by the Japanese Army and Navy in August 1945 increased three times compared with December 1941, that is, the Army aircraft increased from 3,000 to 10,000, and the Navy aircraft increased from 1,200 to 5,886. From this, it can be seen that the US "air operations" against Japan did not cause much damage to Japan's combat capability either.

The US’s combat efforts worth boasting about are only like this.

Of course, we do not deny that the US offensive in the Pacific has made considerable progress. However, this progress was achieved under the circumstances that China and the Soviet Union contained a large number of Japanese troops. Moreover, when the war entered a more difficult stage, the United States immediately retreated in the face of difficulties and adopted a "wait-and-see" policy.

In the battles to attack Iwo Jima in February 1945 and Okinawa at the end of March, the United States suffered greater losses due to the stubborn resistance of the Japanese army, with 39,000 dead and wounded. The American generals felt that "the war is really going to be difficult." (Marshall's two-year report) Therefore, in order to avoid sacrifices, the United States made up its mind to speculate and take advantage, and attempted to use China and the Soviet Union to conduct a decisive battle against Japan, while it would "stand by" (see Marshall's testimony on May 11, 1951), and seize the fruits of victory in the final stage. In his testimony before the US Senate on May 11, 1951, Marshall revealed this unspeakable and shameful plan of the United States. He said: The United States "had considered the issue of attacking the Japanese islands, but later abandoned this plan" because "we must imagine suffering heavy casualties." At this critical juncture, "the US Chiefs of Staff in 1945 believed that it was 'very important' to have the Soviet Union participate in the war against Japan and fight against the Japanese forces in Manchuria and Korea." The United States thus shed its war burden, and after the Battle of Okinawa, it "waited and watched" until the Soviet army joined the war and Japan failed and surrendered.

(III) The Nuclear Blackmail

On August 6 and 8, 1945, in order to bluff and seize the fruits of victory in the war against Japan, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, and vigorously exaggerated the propaganda, saying that it was the main reason for prompting Japan to surrender early. This propaganda by the United States is completely inconsistent with the facts. In fact, the two atomic bombs dropped by the United States only caused many peaceful residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be killed, and did not play any role in defeating Japan. Even the extremely anti-Soviet and anti-communist US warmonger Chennault admitted this truth. He published a statement in the New York Times on August 15, 1945, saying: "The Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was a decisive factor in accelerating the end of the war; even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, the result would still be the same."

Truman and the US generals had been notified of the Soviet Union's decision to participate in the war against Japan on August 9, 1945, at the Potsdam Conference, which began on July 17 of the same year. On July 26, the Japanese government refused to accept the Potsdam Proclamation urging Japan to surrender; therefore, the Soviet Red Army's thunderous strike was about to descend on the Japanese aggressors. In the eyes of the American generals, this situation was unfavorable to them. Because the United States was deeply afraid that the Soviet Union's great victory in the war against Japan would have an adverse effect on the US plan to monopolize Japan and continue to control Asia after the war, it hurriedly decided to use the atomic bomb when the war situation was obviously desperate for Japan, in order to use it as a blackmail tool to seize the fruits of victory in the war against Japan and strengthen the US aggressive position in Asia after the war.

The atomic bomb blackmail, which the United States has vigorously touted as its top achievement in the war against Japan, is so bloody and so despicable!

(IV) The US and UK Separate Peace Treaty with Japan is Illegal and Therefore Invalid

The historical facts mentioned above show that China and the Soviet Union were the main victorious countries in the war against Japan; without the efforts of the people of China and the Soviet Union in fighting, the victory in the war against Japan would have been completely impossible.

However, the separate peace treaty with Japan brokered by the US and UK and the San Francisco conference forcibly convened by the US openly excluded the People's Republic of China, which had fought the war against Japan for the longest time and made the greatest contributions and sacrifices. The US and UK have consistently rejected the just proposals made by the Soviet Union, another major victorious country, regarding the peace treaty with Japan since 1947 with their arrogant and unreasonable attitude. In addition, the US and UK have also completely ignored the opinions of Asian countries and other countries that participated in the war against Japan with their military forces. This arrogant action by the US and UK governments to exclusively broker a peace treaty with Japan is unreasonable and absurd.

The content of the draft peace treaty with Japan unilaterally formulated by the US and UK governments is also absurd. This draft peace treaty with Japan allows Japan to rearm without restriction, allows US occupying forces to continue to be stationed in Japan, allows the US to "trusteeship" Japanese territories such as the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, the Iwo Jima Islands, Nishinoshima, Okinotori Island, and Minami-Tori-shima, attempts to deprive China of its territorial sovereignty over Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and the Nansha Islands, attempts to deprive the Soviet Union of its sovereignty over the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin Island, and attempts to erase the legitimate rights of countries that have been occupied and damaged by Japan to demand compensation from Japan. All of these are serious infringements on the sovereignty and interests of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries, and directly endanger peace in the Far East and the world. This shows that the US-UK peace treaty with Japan is not a peace treaty at all, but an aggressive and war treaty that only serves the interests of US imperialism.

The arrogant actions of the US and UK in exclusively brokering the peace treaty with Japan and the content of the draft peace treaty with Japan unilaterally formulated by them directly violate the Joint Declaration of the United Nations signed by the US, UK, Soviet Union, and China on New Year's Day in 1942, the Cairo Declaration jointly signed by China, the US, and the UK on December 1, 1943, the Yalta Agreement jointly signed by the US, UK, and Soviet Union on February 11, 1945, the Potsdam Proclamation jointly participated in by the US, China, the UK, and the Soviet Union on July 26, 1945, the Potsdam Agreement jointly signed by the Soviet Union, the US, and the UK on August 3, 1945, and the resolution on the basic policy toward defeated Japan passed by the countries of the Far Eastern Commission on June 19, 1947. The Joint Declaration of the United Nations clearly stipulated: "Each government signing this declaration undertakes to cooperate with the governments of the signatory countries and not to conclude a separate armistice agreement or peace treaty with the enemy country." The Potsdam Agreement stipulated that the preparation and drafting of the peace treaty with the enemy country must be carried out by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Five Great Powers. The Cairo Declaration stipulated that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands must be returned to China, and declared that the three major allies (referring to China, the US, and the UK) "have no intention of expanding their territory." The Yalta Agreement stipulated that the Kuril Islands, southern Sakhalin Island, and all adjacent islands must be handed over to and returned to the Soviet Union. The Potsdam Proclamation stipulated that "the occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn immediately after a government that is inclined toward peace and responsible is established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people." and declared that the Allies "have no intention of enslaving the Japanese people or destroying their country." The resolution of the Far Eastern Commission on the basic policy toward defeated Japan stipulated: "Guarantee that Japan will no longer become a threat to world peace and security," "Japan should be completely disarmed and its armaments completely eliminated. And completely eliminate the power of its military and the influence of militarism; strictly ban all systems that manifest militarism and the spirit of aggression." Since the US and UK governments have violated and destroyed these international agreements, the US-UK peace treaty with Japan is completely illegal.

Since the US-UK separate peace treaty with Japan is so absurd, it can only arouse widespread anger and firm opposition from the people of China, the Soviet Union, Asian countries, and the Japanese people. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of our country, issued a statement on August 15, declaring: "The Central People's Government believes that the preparation, drafting, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan, without the participation of the People's Republic of China, regardless of its content and results, are illegal and therefore invalid." The governments of India and Burma have also expressed their firm opposition to the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan and have refused to attend the San Francisco conference. As for the Soviet Union's firm opposition to the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan and its proposals on the peace treaty with Japan issue, it was stated in the "Opinion of the Soviet Government on the US Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" sent by the Soviet government to the US government on May 7 of this year and the note sent by the Soviet government to the US government on June 10 of this year regarding the peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet government's decision to attend the San Francisco conference this time is to put forward its own peace treaty with Japan proposals and to fight for these proposals. Therefore, under this situation, even if the United States uses coercive means to manipulate its European and American puppets and the lackeys of Asia to reluctantly sign a peace treaty with Japan in a pretentious manner, such a treaty is completely invalid and will not work. In addition to arousing greater anger from the people of China, the Soviet Union, other Asian countries, and all peace-loving people in the world, thereby making US imperialism more politically isolated, US imperialism will definitely not get more.

The US and UK imperialists must know that today's Asia is no longer the Asia before the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, and the whole world is no longer the world of the past. The era of imperialism doing whatever it wants is gone forever.

The people of China, the Soviet Union, Asia, and Japan must firmly unite and jointly struggle to smash the US-UK separate peace treaty with Japan that is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, threatens the Asian people, and enslaves the Japanese people! With our firm efforts, the US-UK separate peace treaty with Japan and the US imperialist plot to use this peace treaty to massively arm Japan can be completely shattered. (To be continued)

    美英包办对日和约是完全非法的
    高  集
        三、美英在对日战争中的表现
    在一九四一年十二月七日“珍珠港事件”以前，美英实际上是日本侵略者的帮凶；一九四一年十二月七日日本偷袭珍珠港以后，美英两国始被迫参加对日作战，但它们的行动始终是不积极的。直到苏联以军队参加对日作战前后，美国才以投掷原子弹屠杀日本和平人民，作为手段，盗窃胜利果实，以便使战争在有利于美国帝国主义的条件下结束。
            （一）美英是日本侵略者的帮凶
    由于美英一贯地企图利用日本充当帝国主义东方的反苏宪兵，并使其充当帝国主义侵略中国的先锋，因而美英在日本于一九三一年九月十八日发动侵略中国的战争之后，一面在政治上对日极力绥靖妥协，以满足其侵略野心，一面又在财政经济和战略物资上给日本以援助。美英的这种做法，曾大大助长了日本的侵略气焰，并加强了它的侵略力量。
    对于日本之侵占中国东北，美英当时的基本态度是：“承认日本在满洲之利益”（李顿调查团报告书），和指示中国蒋介石卖国政府执行“不抵抗政策”。当时美国驻日本大使福白斯在向日本外务大臣币原递交的“节略”中说：“本国政府……曾劝中国政府采取妥协步调，并承认以日本政府提案为部分的基础之行政院（按指“国联”行政院）提案……。”当时美国驻英大使道斯更为日本侵略辩护说：“为保护日侨生命财产的安全起见，日本在满洲进兵是理所当然，不可避免的。”在一九三二年“一二八”日本进攻上海时，美英又与法意联合，承认日本在中国东北的行动自由，授意蒋介石卖国政府接受停战撤兵条件，订立损害中国主权的“淞沪协定”。
    美英政府当时的目的是极其显然的，就是以牺牲中国的东北来鼓励日本对苏联的进攻，同时也希望日本的侵略行动停止在东北，以便利它们对中国内地实行独占。因此，在日本于一九三二年一月二日进占锦州之后，美国国务卿史汀生就于同月七日向中日两国发出了所谓“不承认主义”的照会。这个“不承认主义”，实际上并不是反对日本对中国的侵略，而是要日本不要妨碍美国的侵略利益。美国国务院于同年一月八日为史汀生照会发表的补充声明中，即说得很清楚：“（一）美国丝毫无意干涉日本在满洲合法条约的权利，（二）不拟过问日本解决任何事件，惟此次事件，不得破坏美国权利……。”
    美英对日本作战物资和财政上的资助，是日本进行战争的主要动力之一。列宁在一九二○年就曾指出过：“日本有了掠夺东方各国、亚细亚各国的可能，但是没有其他国家底援助，它就没有财政上和军事上独立的力量。”日本侵略中国及亚洲各国的历史事实，证明了列宁这一科学论断的正确性。
    在日本侵占中国东北之后，美国即在“禁运军火不利于中国”的藉口下，对日输出作战物资就逐年增加，至一九三七年七月七日中国人民展开全面抗日战争之后，美国又以“现购自运”法案来便利对日本的资助，而限制中国购买美国军火。因为那时中国沿海已被日本海军武装封锁，“自运”对于中国来说，是完全不可能的。而对于日本，美国则收购其从中国掠夺来的黄金、白银和生丝等原料，以使日本获得用以“现购”的巨额外汇。据日本大藏省的统计，一九三一年时，日本自美国的输入额占其输入总额的百分之二十七点七，而至一九三九年时，据美国商务部的统计，美国输日物资已增到占日本输入总额的百分之四十八。在美国输日的物资中，作战物资占了大部分，并且其比重还逐年增加，一九三七年美国输日物资中的作战物资占百分之五十三，一九三八年增至百分之六十三，一九三九年前九个月再增至百分之七十一。从一九三七年一月至
    一九四○年九月，美国输日作战物资总值在六亿五千万美元以上。至于英国，在这一方面虽然略逊于美国，但也曾尽力而为。以一九三九年来说，英帝国输给日本的作战物资，占日本全部作战物资输入的百分之二二点一二。
    在美英资助日本的每一批作战物资所赚回的每一个美元或英镑上，都是沾满了对日抗战的中国人民的鲜血的，而且在珍珠港事变之后，日本又利用了这些作战物资进行了对美英和东南亚人民的屠杀。
    美英在日本的侵略行为上就是这样的一个帮凶。
    而且不止如此，美英在中国人民单独进行抗日战争的那一个漫长的时期中，时时都曾阴谋着断送中国人民保卫祖国独立的斗争，来缓和它们与日本争夺统治亚洲的矛盾。美英这种无耻的做法，在一九四○年以后至一九四一年间，由于日本积极布置南进而发展到了最高峰。一九四○年七月，英国邱吉尔政府接受日本的要求，宣布封锁当时中国在西南的对外通路滇缅路三个月，“不许运输军械、军火、汽油、汽车和铁路器材。”一九四○年十二月，美国即与日本开始接洽所谓“调整美日邦交”的秘密谈判。据当时日本首相近卫文麿日记的记载：美国在这一商谈中，曾表示可由美国来“劝告”“‘蒋政权’与‘汪政权’合并”，并由美蒋“承认满洲国”，来换得日本“不武力南进”的保证，同时，对于日本所希望获得之西南太平洋战略物资，“美国方面应给以协助与支持”。
    美国的阴谋与美日的矛盾是很显然的，美国是希望在日本积极反苏的前提下与日本共同控制中国，分享太平洋的特权，而日本则要独占亚洲，不肯让步；因而美国的妥协政策，就换来了日本对珍珠港的突然袭击。
            （二）对日作战不力，投机取巧
    美英在一九四一年十二月七日被迫参加对日作战后，在全部战争过程中的表现，是作战不力，投机取巧，并以各种藉口来欺骗世界人民，卸脱作战负担。美英这种不光荣的表现，与中苏两国在战争中的忠诚努力与光辉贡献是完全不能相比的。
    在开战的最初几天内，由于日本的偷袭，美英曾遭受到惨重的损失。这是美英长期对日绥靖妥协的一个自然结果。由一九四一年十二月至一九四二年六月，美英军队节节败退，使日本在半年之内便席卷了半个太平洋，获得了丰富的作战物资，以继续进行和扩大侵略战争。
    由一九四一年十二月至一九四三年六月，这一年半中，美英在太平洋上除了在中途岛对日本的东进做了一次招架外，就没有与日本进行过较为严重的战斗。马歇尔在他任职美国陆军参谋总长期间所作的两年度（一九四三—一九四五）报告书内，也不得不承认：“凭良心说，在那危殆的时候（按指一九四二年），却敌解难之功，我们美国实在很少出力。”
    当然美英也曾试图向世界人民辩解，说它们的那时作战不力是因为“专心在应付欧洲战争”（见前举马歇尔两年报告书），但事实上它们在欧洲却是尽一切可能迁延开辟第二战场。显然的，所谓“专心在应付欧洲战争”，完全是自欺欺人之谈。美英在战争初期的作战不力之罪，是无法卸脱的。
    美国对它们在太平洋所进行的“越岛进攻”和对日本所进行的“空中作战”，曾经加以大吹大擂。这也是美国一贯夸大宣传的“海空优势”论的一种。但事实上，这种海空攻势在对日作战中所起的实际效果，实在是很有限的。
    关于“越岛进攻”，马歇尔自己也曾说过：“在初期，我们向日本占领区进攻，是迟缓而痛苦的。在美国人看来，如果我们必须像在新几内亚的巴布亚海岸或在瓜达康纳尔那般血战，采用一般人所称的‘越岛战术’，与日本人决战，似乎还要许多年。”
    （见前引两年报告书）至于“空中作战”的效果呢？美国对日空袭是在一九四五年三月以后，才连续以较大的规模进行，而据美国战略轰炸调查团的报告，日本军需工业因空袭而遭受破坏的程度是极为轻微的。以钢铁生产而论，铣铁生产的破坏只有百分之三到百分之五，平炉钢块只有百分之二，钢板百分之一。又据日本陆军省和海军省发表的统计数字，日本陆海军保有的飞机数目，在一九四五年八月比一九四一年十二月时增加了三倍，即陆军飞机由三千架增加到一万架，海军飞机由一千二百架增加到五千八百八十六架。由此可以看出，美国对日的“空中作战”也并未使日本的作战能力受到很大伤害。
    美国所值得夸耀的作战努力不过如此。
    当然，我们也并不否认美国在太平洋的攻势曾经获得相当的进展。不过这种进展是在中苏两国牵制了日本大量兵力的情形下得到的。而且，当战争进入比较艰苦阶段的时候，美国立即知难而退，采取了“观望”政策。
    美国在一九四五年二月进攻琉璜岛和三月底进攻琉球的战役中，由于日军的顽固抵抗，遭受了较大的损失，死伤三万九千人。美国的将军们感觉到“战事真是要艰难起来了。”（马歇尔两年度报告书）因此，为了避免牺牲，美国便立定投机取巧的决心，企图利用中苏对日进行决战，而自己则“袖手旁观”（见马歇尔一九五一年五月十一日作证发言），并且在最后阶段乘机来窃据胜利果实。马歇尔在一九五一年五月十一日在美国参议院的作证发言中，透露了美国这一不可告人的可耻计划。他说：美国“曾考虑进攻日本各岛的问题，但以后放弃了这个计划”，因为“我们必须想像遭受很大的死伤。”而在这个关头上，“美国各参谋长们在一九四五年认为，使苏联参加对日战争而与满洲和朝鲜的日军作战是‘非常重要的’”。美国就这样卸脱了它的战争负担，在琉球战役以后，一直“观望”到苏军参战，日本失败投降为止。
                （三）原子弹的讹诈
    在一九四五年八月六日和八日，美国为了虚张声势，夺取对日战争的胜利果实，向日本广岛和长崎投掷了两颗原子弹，并且极力夸大宣传，把它说成是促使日本提早投降的主要原因。美国的这种宣传，是完全不符合事实的。实际上，美国所投掷的这两颗原子弹，只是使广岛和长崎的和平居民被炸死很多，对于战胜日本是不起什么作用的。这一真理，甚至极端仇苏反共的美国战争贩子陈纳德也是承认的，他在一九四五年八月十五日的纽约时报上发表谈话说：“苏联参加对日作战是战争加快结束具有决定性的因素；即使原子弹没有投掷，结果仍是一样。”
    苏联在一九四五年八月九日参加对日作战的决定，杜鲁门和美国的将军们在同年七月十七日开始举行的波茨坦会议上就已得到通知了。七月二十六日，日本政府拒绝接受促令日本投降的波茨坦公告；因而苏联红军雷霆万钧的打击就要降临在日本侵略者的身上了。在美国的将军们看来，这情形对于他们是不利的。因为美国深怕苏联在对日战争中的伟大胜利，会对美国在战后独占日本，继续控制亚洲的计划发生不利的影响，所以它便在战局对日本显然已经绝望的情形下匆忙地决定使用原子弹，以便把它当作一种讹诈手段，来夺取对日战争的胜利果实，加强美国战后在亚洲的侵略地位。
    被美国极力说成为它在对日战争中头等功绩的原子弹讹诈，就是如此的血腥，如此的可鄙！
    （四）美英单独对日和约是非
            法的，因而是无效的
    上述的历史事实说明了：中苏两国是对日战争的主要战胜国；没有中苏两国人民的努力作战，对日战争的胜利是完全不可能的。
    然而，美英包办的单独对日和约及美国强制召开的旧金山会议，却公然将对日作战最久、贡献与牺牲最大的中华人民共和国排斥在外；对于另外一个主要战胜国苏联自一九四七年以来屡次提出的关于对日和约的公正主张，美英又一贯以其蛮横无理的态度加以拒绝。此外，美英也一概无视亚洲各国及其他以军队参加对日作战国家的意见。美英两国政府这种单独包办对日和约的蛮横行动，是毫无道理的，荒谬绝伦的。
        美英两国政府片面制订的对日和约草案的内容，同样也是荒谬绝伦的。这个对日和约草案，允许日本无限制地重新武装，允许美国占领军继续留驻日本，允许美国“托管”日本领土琉球群岛、小笠原群岛、琉璜列岛、西之岛、冲之鸟岛及南鸟岛等地，企图剥夺我国对台湾、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛及南威岛的领土主权，企图剥夺苏联对千岛群岛及库页岛南部的主权，并企图抹杀曾受日本占领及损害的国家要求日本赔偿的正当权利。所有这些，都是严重侵害中国、苏联及亚洲其他国家的主权和利益的，并且是直接危害远东及世界和平的。这就表明，美英对日和约，决不是什么和平条约，而只是服从于美帝国主义利益的一个侵略和战争条约。
    美英单独包办对日和约的蛮横行动和它们片面制订的对日和约草案的内容，都直接违反由美、英、苏、中等国于一九四二年元旦共同参加签订的联合国家共同宣言，一九四三年十二月一日由中、美、英共同签订的开罗宣言，一九四五年二月十一日由美、英、苏共同签订的雅尔达协定，一九四五年七月二十六日由美、中、英、苏所共同参加的波茨坦公告，一九四五年八月三日由苏、美、英共同签订的波茨坦协定，及一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会各国所通过的对投降后日本之基本政策的决议等庄严的国际协定。联合国家共同宣言曾明确规定：在该宣言上签字的“每一政府承允与宣言签字国政府合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定与和约。”波茨坦协定规定对敌国和约的准备与拟制必须由五大国外长会议负责进行。开罗宣言规定台湾及澎湖列岛必须归还中国，并宣布三大盟国（指中美英）“无拓展领土之意”。雅尔达协定规定千岛群岛、库页岛南部及邻近一切岛屿须交予及交还苏联。波茨坦公告规定“依据日本人民自由表示之意志成立一倾向和平及负责之政府后，同盟国占领军队当即撤退。”并宣布盟国“无意奴役日本民族或消灭其国家”。远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策的决议规定：“保证日本不再成为世界和平与安全之威胁”，“日本应完全解除武装与军备。并完全消灭其军部权力与军国主义之影响；严格取缔一切表现军国主义与侵略精神之制度。”美英两国政府既然已违背和破坏了这些国际协定，因而美英对日和约就是完全非法的。
    美英单独对日和约既然如此荒谬绝伦，当然只能激起中苏及亚洲各国人民与日本人民普遍的愤怒与坚决的反对。我国中央人民政府外交部长周恩来已于八月十五日发表声明，宣布：“对日和约的准备、拟制和签订，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其内容和结果如何，中央人民政府一概认为是非法的，因而也是无效的。”印度及缅甸政府也表示坚决反对美英对日和约草案，并已拒绝出席旧金山会议。至于苏联对美英对日和约草案的坚决反对态度，及关于对日和约问题的主张，是早在今年五月七日苏联政府致美国政府的“苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见书”及今年六月十日苏联政府致美国政府的关于对日和约的照会中表明了。苏联政府这次决定出席旧金山会议，就是为了提出自己的对日和约建议并为此建议而奋斗。所以，在这种情况下，即使美国以强制手段操纵其欧洲、美洲的傀儡及亚洲的保大之流，勉强地装样子地签订出一个对日和约，这样的和约也是完全无效的，行不通的。这除了激起中苏两国和亚洲其他国家的人民及全世界一切爱好和平的人民更大的愤怒，从而使美帝国主义在政治上更加孤立以外，美帝国主义是绝对得不到更多的东西的。
    美英帝国主义必须知道：今天的亚洲已经不是一九三一年“九一八”以前的亚洲，整个世界已不是过去的世界了。帝国主义为所欲为的时代已一去不复返了。
    中苏和亚洲人民及日本人民必须坚决团结起来，为粉碎美英帝国主义敌视中苏、威胁亚洲人民，奴役日本人民的美英单独对日和约而共同奋斗！在我们的坚决努力下，美英单独对日和约及美帝国主义企图利用这个对日和约大规模武装日本的阴谋是完全可以被粉碎的。（续完）
