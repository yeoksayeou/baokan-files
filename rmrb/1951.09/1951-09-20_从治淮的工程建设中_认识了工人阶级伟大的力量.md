Recognizing the Great Power of the Working Class from the Huai River Project Construction
Zhang Liao, Special-Class Huai River Model Worker, Xiping, Henan

    The Huai River project began in October of last year. I immediately signed up and mobilized 150 young and strong farmers to form a civilian labor squad. I was selected as the instructor. At first, we worked at Wu Song Lake, and later we worked on the depression storage project at Lao Wangpo. In our work, under the leadership of the Party and the efforts of our fellow civilian laborers, we successfully completed our tasks each time. When the Lao Wangpo project came to an end, I was named a Huai River model worker, and our squad was also awarded the title of Model Squad. The Lao Wangpo project ended at the time of wheat harvest. I heard at the construction site that the Shiman Reservoir project was very urgent, and if it could not be completed before the big flood season, the entire project would be damaged by a major flood. Therefore, I mobilized 80 young and strong civilian laborers from my township and organized a shock squad with Dingzhuang Township in the neighboring township to go to Shiman to help with the work. The Shiman Reservoir was finally successfully completed before the big flood season arrived.
    In the Huai River project, I particularly felt the greatness of the worker brothers. Concrete facts resolved my erroneous thinking that "the Communist Party is a peasant party" (Comrade Zhang Liao is a Communist Party member). At the construction site, there were electric lights, rails, mountain openers... everything; some of these things, I hadn't even heard of in the past. These machines are in the hands of the worker brothers, and they are all made by them. If it weren't for the worker brothers taking the lead in the construction, relying solely on our farmers' carrying baskets, hoes, and iron shovels, it would be impossible to complete the Shiman Reservoir project in five or ten years. This made me understand a truth: if farmers want to live a good life, they must unite with the worker brothers, with the worker brothers leading the way in front, and us farmers supporting the team from behind, and all difficulties can be overcome. (Reported by Gao Zhen)

    "If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading the Huai River project,
    we wouldn't even have food to eat"
    Li Laohua, Special-Class Huai River Model Worker, Fuyang Prefecture
    Last July, it rained continuously, and our Jianshe Township was surrounded by floods. Most of the crops were flooded, and some houses were washed away. People had no food or drink, and no place to live. However, the rain continued to fall. At that time, everyone was worried and said, "Heaven is going to harm us, we only have one way to die."
    The people's savior - Chairman Mao knew about this situation, and he was determined to fundamentally control the Huai River. This news spread to our township, and people were so happy that they jumped up. Under Chairman Mao's great call, I led more than 400 people to work on the Huai River embankment. I was determined: "I will not go home until the Huai River is controlled!" I took the lead in working actively on the Huai River embankment; during rest, I explained the importance of hygiene to everyone, helped the civilian laborers with washing clothes and cooking, and tried my best to solve the difficulties in the lives of the civilian laborers. At this time, my child was very sick, and my family sent me three letters in a row urging me to go back, but I did not go back. I am a member of the Youth League, and I want to perform meritorious service for the people. I truly performed meritorious service, and I was named a model worker in the spring Huai River project.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries, led by Chiang Kai-shek, breached the Huayuankou Yellow River embankment in 1938, flooding our hometown. Since then, our fields have always been flooded nine out of ten times. We had no food or drink, and the reactionary government constantly plundered us. Now the Communist Party has come, helping us poor people to turn over, and leading us to control the Huai River. After only one year of controlling the Huai River, the crops are already growing very well. Wang Shiqing of Dama Village in our township has twelve mu of land. In the past, eleven mu were always in the water every year, but this year none of it was flooded. In the past, he had no way to make a living, but this year he took 427 jin of grain to join the cooperative. He said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao controlling the Huai River, we wouldn't even have food to eat." Now everyone is singing: "Don't forget the Communist Party when you turn over, don't forget Chairman Mao when you are happy." Everyone said that they wanted to thoroughly respond to Chairman Mao's call: "We must repair the Huai River well." (Reported by Liu Shengzhong)

    The Communist Party has come, and everything has changed
    Wu Jiayin, Huai River Model Worker, Huoqiu, Northern Anhui
    Our village is called Dawutaizi Village, with a total of 96 households, 406 people, and
    1376 mu of land. Most of the people in the village are poor and hired peasants. My family of six has sixteen mu of land. I am now the propaganda committee member and construction committee member of the township farmers' association.
    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, most of the people in our village were suffering people. Every month, we had to pay more than a dozen donations, and the crops we harvested were not enough to hand over to them. The most terrible thing was drafting soldiers. The young people in the village did not dare to produce at home and ran around to avoid it. In addition, there were floods every year, so the fields in the village were barren or abandoned, and we never harvested good grain.
    The first major flood in our village was in 1930. There was a Zhangjia Weizi village six or seven li south of our village. There was a big landlord in that village named Zhang Xiangchen. He had a private feud with the local tyrant Shi Jichuan on the south bank of the Henan River. On the night of June 6th that year, the river rose sharply. Shi Jichuan wanted to use water to wash away Zhangjia Weizi, so he sent four small boats to breach the embankment at Linshuiji. As a result, millions of people suffered. It is said that the water head was about a zhang high and rushed straight to our village, drowning thirty or forty people. Now there are more than 300 mu of flying sand land south of our village, which was formed at that time. The Zhang and Shi families were relatives of each other, and they reconciled in less than a year. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek breached the Huayuankou Yellow River embankment, and our village was flooded every year. In addition, bandits rampaged, and there were exorbitant taxes, conscription, and rent collection. We have not had a good day for more than ten years. I still remember that before 1938, we could harvest 200 jin per mu, but after that, it was getting worse every year, and we could only harvest 50 or 60 jin per mu. At that time, the reactionaries also
    "Controlled the Huai River", but their purpose of "controlling the Huai River" was to take the opportunity to make a fortune. At that time, the civilian laborers ate their own food and did the government's work, and they were also beaten and scolded. Old men like Wu Jiye and Xue Yifang in our village broke their backs during the dam pressure at that time. Those fake Baojia chiefs, section chiefs, and embankment chiefs all made a lot of money from it. Jiang Zipan of Jiangji, for example, used the embezzled money to buy 49 qing of land in one year.
    Now our village has changed. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we called on to repair the Huai River. In just one year, our village had a great harvest this year, with an average yield of 240 jin per mu. There are no exorbitant taxes, no landlord exploitation, and we are motivated to produce. Every family in our village is happy and everyone is happy. We are now reclaiming the flying sand land that has been barren for more than ten years, and we are also building schools, preparing to send children to school during the day and adults to night school at night. We have turned over politically and economically, and we must also turn over culturally. Almost everyone in our village has bought new clothes this year. In the past, it was good enough not to starve to death.
    Controlling the Huai River is everyone's business. Chairman Mao is determined: "We must repair the Huai River well." None of us do not support it. I went to the embankment during the winter repair last year, and I went to the embankment again during the spring repair this year, and I also became a group leader. This spring, we repaired the Xiage embankment, and it was the first time I had seen such a big embankment. I thought to myself: how long will it take to repair such a big embankment? However, with the joint efforts of workers and peasants, it was completed in May. At the celebration meeting in Huoqiu County, our group was named a special model group, and we were also awarded a big water buffalo. I was also named a first-class Huai River model worker. Later, I went to a meeting in the prefecture, and the superiors encouraged us to continue to strive to be a model. I think we poor people can only have a good life under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Looking at the situation in our village, we have food and clothing and don't have to worry at all. I must continue to strive to be a model, rely on the masses everywhere, increase grain production, donate airplanes and cannons, defeat the American devils, and defend our good times.

    从治淮的工程建设中
    认识了工人阶级伟大的力量
    河南西平特等治淮模范  张辽
    去年十月间治淮工程开始，我立刻报名参加，并动员了年青力壮的农民一百五十人，组成一个民工中队。我被选为指导员。开头我们在吴宋湖工作，以后又到老王坡作洼地蓄洪工作。在工作中，在党的领导和民工兄弟们的努力下，每次都胜利完成了任务。老王坡工程告一段落，我被评为治淮模范，我们中队也得了模范中队的称号。割麦子的时候，老王坡工程结束了。我在工地听说石漫滩水库工程很紧，若在大汛以前不能完工，发了大水，全部工程都要受到损失；于是我又动员俺乡青壮年民工八十人，与邻乡丁庄乡组织成一个突击中队，前往石漫滩帮助工作。石漫滩水库终于在大汛未到前胜利完成了任务。
    在治淮工作中，我特别感觉到工人兄弟的伟大。具体的事实，解决了我的“共产党是农民党”的错误思想（张辽同志是共产党员）。工地上，电灯、铁轨、开山机……应有尽有；这些东西，俺过去有的连听也没有听说过。这些机器掌握在工人兄弟手里，都是他们制造出来的。要不是有工人兄弟带头修建，就凭我们农民的抬筐、镢头、铁铣，修筑石漫滩水库工程五年、十年也别想完成。这使我明白了一条道理，农民要想过好日子，就得和工人兄弟联合起来，前面由工人兄弟领着，后面咱农民拥着队，啥困难都可克服。（高真记）
    “要不是毛主席领导治淮，
    俺连饭也吃不上”
    阜阳专区特等治淮模范李劳华
    去年七月阴雨连绵，俺们建设乡被大水包围，庄稼大部被淹，有些房子也被冲倒了。人们没有吃喝，没有住处。可是，雨还是不停地下着。那时，人人发愁，都说：“天要害人，俺们只有死路一条。”
    人民的救星——毛主席知道了这种情形，他下决心，要根治淮河。这消息传到俺乡，人们都喜欢得跳了起来。在毛主席的伟大号召下，我带动了四百多人，到淮河堤上作工。我下定决心：“不治好淮河不回家！”我在淮河堤上带头积极做工；在休息时和大家讲解清洁卫生的重要，帮助民工洗衣裳做饭，尽量想法解决民工生活上的困难。这时，我的小孩病的很重，家里一连三封信催我回去，但我没有回去。我是个青年团员，我要为人民立功。我真正立了功，我在春季治淮中被评为模范。
    国民党反动派头子蒋介石在一九三八年扒开花园口黄河堤，淹了我们的家乡，从此以后，俺们的田地总是十种九淹。我们没有吃喝，反动政府还不断搜刮我们。如今共产党来了，帮俺穷人翻身，领导俺们治淮。治淮才一年，庄稼已经长的很好了。俺乡大马庄王士清有十二亩地，过去每年总有十一亩在水里，今年一点没淹。往年他生活没办法，今年却拿了四百二十七斤粮食在合作社入了股。他说：“要不是毛主席治淮，俺连饭也吃不上。”现在到处唱着：“翻身不忘共产党，幸福莫忘毛主席。”大家都表示要彻底响应毛主席的号召：“一定要把淮河修好”。（刘省中记）
    共产党来了，啥都变样了
    皖北霍邱治淮模范    吴家印
    俺村叫大吴台子村，共有九十六户，四百零六人，
    一千三百七十六亩地。村里人大部是贫雇农成份。俺家六口人，有十六亩田。俺现在是乡农会宣传委员和建设委员。
    在国民党反动统治时代，俺村大部分都是受苦人，每月要出十几回捐项，收的庄稼还不够交给他们。最可怕的是拉壮丁，村里的年青人都不敢在家生产，到处跑着躲避。又加上年年闹水灾，所以村里田地荒的荒，丢的丢，没有收过好粮食。
    俺村第一次闹大水是一九三○年。俺村南边六、七里有个张家圩子，那村里有个大地主叫张相臣。他和河南岸的恶霸施继川有私仇。那年六月初六日夜里，河水大涨。施继川想用水冲掉张家圩子，就派了四个小划子，到临水集扒开河堤。这一来，可把千百万老百姓害苦了。那水头听说有丈把高，直冲到俺村，光是人就被淹死三、四十口。现在俺村南边有三百多亩飞沙地，就是那时冲成的。张、施两家是儿女亲家，不到一年又和好了。一九三八年，蒋介石扒开了花园口黄河堤，俺村更是年年遭淹。再加上兵匪横行、苛捐杂税、抽壮丁、要租子，十几年来我们没有过一天好日子。我还记得，在一九三八年以前，我们每亩地能收二百斤，以后一年不如一年，每亩只能收五、六十斤了。那时反动派也
    “治淮河”，但他们“治淮河”的目的是借机会发财。那时民工吃的是自己的饭，干的是官家的事，还要受打挨骂。俺村吴继业、薛义方等老大爷，就是那时打坝压驼了腰的。那些伪保甲长、段长、堤长都从中大捞油水，像蒋集的蒋自潘，光在一年间，就用贪污的钱，买了四十九顷田。
    现在俺村可变了样了。在毛主席领导下，号召修淮河，不过一年，俺村今年就来了个大丰收，每亩平均产二百四十斤。没有苛捐杂税，没有地主剥削，俺们生产有劲了。俺村家家高兴，户户快乐。现在正在开垦那荒了十几年的飞沙地，还正在修建学校，准备白天给孩子们上学，晚上俺们成年人上夜校。俺们在政治上、经济上翻了身，在文化上也要翻过身来。俺村的人，今年差不多都置了新衣裳。要是往年，不饿死就算是好的了。
    治淮是大家的事，毛主席下决心：“一定要把淮河修好”。俺们没有一个不拥护的。去年冬修时，我就上堤了，今年春修，我又上了堤，还当了小组长。今年春天修的是下格堤，我还是第一次见这么大的堤。我先想：这么大的堤，什么时候能修好呢？可是在工农联合努力下，五月里就完成了。在霍邱县开庆功大会时，我们小组被评为特等模范组，还奖给我们一头大水牛。我个人也被评为一等治淮模范。后来又到专区开会，上级鼓励我们继续争取模范。我想我们穷人，只有在共产党毛主席的领导下才有好日子过，看一看俺村情景，有吃有穿，一点也不用愁啦。我一定要再继续争取模范，处处依靠群众，多增产粮食，捐献飞机大炮，打倒美国鬼子，保卫咱们的好光景。
