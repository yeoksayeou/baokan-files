Lifting a Stone Only to Drop it on One's Own Feet

On September 23rd, the reactionary Menzies government of Australia suffered a shameful defeat in the national vote attempting to outlaw the Australian Communist Party. This is another powerful blow by the Australian people against the Menzies government's anti-people measures.

The Australian Communist Party has waged unremitting struggles against the Menzies reactionary government's pursuit of the American policy of aggression and its betrayal of the interests of the Australian people. The Menzies government has continuously carried out illegal persecution against the Australian Communist Party. In April of last year, it submitted to parliament the so-called "Menzies Bill" to outlaw the Australian Communist Party. However, this reactionary measure of the Menzies government immediately met with strong opposition from the Australian people, and triggered a huge wave of strikes across the country. Under the enormous pressure of the people, the Australian High Court ruled in March of this year that the "Menzies Bill" was unconstitutional and declared it invalid. The Menzies government did not learn a lesson from that failure, and on July 5th of this year, it submitted a new bill to parliament, requesting a national vote to decide on amending the constitution to ban the Australian Communist Party. In this national vote, the Menzies government lifted a stone only to drop it on its own feet, suffering an even more miserable defeat.

This fact shows that the broad masses of the Australian people are firmly united around the Australian Communist Party. The victory of the Australian Communist Party and the people in this struggle is also a victory for the Australian people in defending peace.

    搬起石头砸了自己的脚
    九月二十三日，澳大利亚孟席斯反动政府在妄图宣布澳大利亚共产党为非法的全国投票中，遭到了可耻的失败。这是澳大利亚人民对孟席斯政府反人民措施的又一次有力的打击。
   澳大利亚共产党为反对孟席斯反动政府追随美国侵略政策，出卖澳大利亚人民利益而进行了不懈的斗争。孟席斯政府对澳大利亚共产党曾不断进行非法迫害，在去年四月即曾向议会提出宣布澳大利亚共产党为非法的所谓“孟席斯法案”。但是孟席斯政府的这一反动措施，立即遭到澳大利亚人民的强烈反对，在全国激起了巨大的罢工浪潮。在人民巨大的压力下，澳大利亚最高法院在今年三月判定“孟席斯法案”违反宪法，宣告无效。而孟席斯政府并没有在那一次失败中取得教训，又于今年七月五日，向议会提出新法案，要求举行全国投票，以决定修改宪法来取缔澳大利亚共产党。在这一次全国投票中，孟席斯政府是搬起石头砸了自己的脚，遭到了更为悲惨的失败。
   这一事实说明了，澳大利亚的广大人民是坚决地团结在澳大利亚共产党的周围的。澳大利亚共产党及人民在这一斗争中的胜利也是澳大利亚人民保卫和平的一个胜利。
