    Hebei Shunyi County Second District Cadre Song Wenfu
    It is Wrong to Encourage the Masses to Cut Down Forests to Survive Famine
Editor:
    When I was at my home in Lianzhuang Village, Second District, Shunyi County, Hebei Province at the end of March and beginning of April this year, I saw that the masses in this village and the surrounding villages, such as Dongshuiquan Village, Xishuiquan Village, and Hezhuangying Village, were massively and indiscriminately felling trees. Most of the pine, cypress, poplar, and willow trees had already been cut down. It is said that this indiscriminate felling began at the beginning of January this year and is still going on now. The county People's Government has not yet stopped it. The reason is this: Most villages in the Second District of Shunyi County have suffered from famine for years, and the people's lives are very hard. Comrade Song Wenfu, a cadre in the Second District, went to several villages, such as Dongshuiquan Village, at the beginning of this year and saw that the disaster was more serious. Instead of actively leading the masses to engage in production for self-salvation, he distributed the trees that had been confiscated from the landlords and belonged to the farmers' association during the land reform to the masses (even the landlords got a share), encouraging the masses to cut down trees and sell them to survive the famine, thus causing the phenomenon of indiscriminate felling of trees by the masses.
    I believe this practice is extremely wrong, and the relevant authorities should immediately investigate and deal with it, and quickly stop this behavior that harms the long-term interests of the country.

    河北顺义县二区干部宋文富
    鼓励群众伐林度荒是错误的编辑同志：
    今年三月底四月初，我在河北顺义县二区联庄村家里的时候，看到本村及周围几个村，如东水泉村、西水泉村、河庄营村，群众都在大量地滥伐林木，松、柏、杨、柳等树已大部被砍尽。这种滥伐，据说今年一月初就开始了，直到现在还在进行，县人民政府至今没有加以制止。原因是这样：顺义县二区大部村庄连年遭受灾荒，群众生活很苦。二区区干部宋文富同志，今年年初到东水泉村等几个村，看到灾情较重，他不积极领导群众生产自救，却将土地改革时没收地主归农会所有的树木分给群众（连地主也分得一份），鼓励群众砍树出售度灾荒，因而造成群众滥伐林木的现象。
    我以为这种作法是极端错误的，有关机关应即进行调查处理，迅速制止这种危害国家长远利益的行为。
