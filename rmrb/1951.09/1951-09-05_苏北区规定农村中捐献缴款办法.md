Editor's Note: Currently, various regions have begun or are about to begin the autumn harvest. After the autumn harvest, the broad masses of farmers will enthusiastically donate grain to purchase airplanes and cannons. Therefore, properly collecting the grain donated by the masses of farmers and promptly converting it into cash to purchase airplanes and cannons and depositing it into the People's Bank of China is something that leading bodies in various regions should pay close attention to and prepare for early. The methods stipulated by the Northern Jiangsu District not only conform to the spirit of our association's June 7th notice but also take into account the actual situation in rural areas, which is worthy of reference by various regions.

In order to solve the difficulties in donation and payment in rural areas, the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the People's Bank of China, the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the China Grain Company, and the Northern Jiangsu Cooperative Union held a joint meeting on July 27th. The meeting believed that the movement to donate airplanes and cannons is currently developing from cities to rural areas, and farmers in various regions are actively formulating plans to increase production and donate enthusiastically. However, due to the dispersion of rural areas and inconvenient transportation, it is bound to be difficult to make unified payments to the bank. In addition, there is a lack of currency in rural areas, and it is necessary to convert grain before donating. In order to solve the above difficulties, after discussion and research, the following regulations were made:

   I. Starting from August, all district and township cooperatives in northern Jiangsu will be entrusted as collection agencies for farmers' donations for airplanes and cannons.

  II. In order to take care of the lack of currency in rural areas, donors can pay with grain. It is recommended that various regions collect this grain collectively from cooperatives on a natural village basis. The cooperative will convert the grain into Renminbi at the grain company's listed price based on the type and quantity of grain and issue a receipt in the prescribed format. When farmers pay donated grain, they should focus on the main grains of the production area, such as rice in paddy field areas, corn, soybeans, sorghum, and wheat in dry land areas, and cotton in cotton field areas. The grain type, quality, wastage, and transportation costs of the donated grain received by the cooperative shall be handled in accordance with the previous standards for the Grain Company's entrustment of the cooperative to receive grain.

  III. The donations received by the cooperative must be paid to the People's Bank of China on a regular basis, and the amount of grain received converted into Renminbi should be reported to the county People's Bank of China in exchange for a unified receipt. At the same time, a table should be made and reported to the county cooperative headquarters and the county grain company, listing the type, quantity, and unit price of the grain received. The grain should be handed over to the grain company, and a consignment relationship should be established between the two parties. However, the cash for this grain should be allocated by the county grain company to the county People's Bank of China for deposit. This report should be made no more than once every ten days. If the amount of donations received within the specified number of days exceeds 10 million yuan, a report should be made to the county at any time. Each time the cooperative reports the amount of donations, a copy should also be sent to the district and township organs in charge of donation work.

  IV. The donated grain received by the cooperative shall be dispatched uniformly by the county grain company and shall not be transported by itself. If the county grain company does not transport it temporarily, each cooperative should be responsible for temporary storage within its capacity. If there are difficulties in warehousing and storage, the local government should help solve them.

   V. In order to facilitate farmers' donation payments, contributors can pay their half-year donation plan in one or two installments after the autumn harvest. The village, township, district, and county levels are responsible for publicizing the amount of donations monthly. The Northern Jiangsu Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association will announce the donation amount of each county and city and each special district in Northern Jiangsu in the Northern Jiangsu Daily on the fifth of each month. The Resist America, Aid Korea Associations of each county and city and each special district are required to telegraph the classified donation amount of the previous month to the Northern Jiangsu Resist America, Aid Korea Association before 10:00 PM on the third of each month.

    苏北区规定农村中捐献缴款办法
    编者按：目前各地已开始或即将开始秋收，广大农民在秋收后将热烈捐献粮食来购买飞机大炮。因此，妥善地收缴农民群众捐献的粮食并及时把它变成购买飞机大炮的现款缴入人民银行，是各地领导机关应该密切注意，早为筹划准备的事。苏北区所规定的办法，既符合本会六月七日通知的精神，又照顾了农村的实际情况，值得各地参考。
    为解决农村中的捐献缴款困难，苏北区抗美援朝分会、中国人民银行苏北分行、中国粮食公司苏北分公司、苏北合作社联合社于七月二十七日举行联合会议。会议认为：目前捐献飞机大炮运动正由城市向农村发展，各地农民纷纷订立增产捐献计划，踊跃捐献。但由于农村分散，交通不便，统一向银行缴款势必发生困难，加之农村中货币缺乏，需变换粮食始能缴纳捐款。为了解决上述困难，经讨论研究后，作出了如下几点规定：
    一、从八月份起，委托全苏北所有设在农村中之区、乡合作社，同时为各地农民捐献飞机大炮款项的代收机关。
    二、为照顾农村中货币缺乏，捐献者可以缴纳粮食。此项粮食，建议各地以自然村为单位向合作社集体缴纳，由合作社根据粮食种类、数量，按粮食公司牌价折合人民币填发规定式样之收据。农民缴纳捐献粮时，应以产地主要粮食为主，如水田地区的稻子，旱田地区的玉米、黄豆、高粱、麦类，棉田地区的棉花等。合作社收进捐献粮之粮种成色及蚀耗、转运费用等均按已往粮食公司委托合作社收进标准办理。
    三、合作社所收进之捐献款项须定期缴解人民银行，并将收进粮食折合人民币数字，报告县人民银行换取统一收据。同时，并制成表册向县合作总社、县粮食公司报告收进之粮种及数字与单价；粮食交粮食公司，双方建立代购关系；但此项粮食之现金由县粮食公司拨款交县人民银行入库。此项报告最多不得超过十天一次；如在规定天数内所收进之捐献数字满一千万元以上时，得随时向县报告。合作社每次上报捐献数字时，应同时抄送一份给所在地之区、乡主持捐献工作的机关。
    四、合作社所收进之捐献粮食，统由县粮食公司调度，不得自行转运。如县粮食公司暂不转运，各合作社应在可能范围内负临时保管之责。在设仓保管中如遇有困难，由地方政府帮助解决。
    五、为照顾农民捐献缴款方便起见，可由认购者在秋收登场后，将半年的捐献计划作一次或两次缴纳。并责成各村、乡、区、县四级每月向人民公布一次。苏北区抗美援朝分会于每月五日在苏北日报上公布苏北各县市、各专区上月份捐献数目。要求各县市、各专区抗美援朝分会于每月三日下午十时前将上月份捐献数目分类电报苏北抗美援朝分会。
