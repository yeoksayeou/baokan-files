    “Fighting Enemy Aircraft” Enhanced My Confidence in Fighting the Enemy
    To the Editor:
    After reading the Korean dispatch "Fighting Enemy Aircraft" (by Li Yizhen) published in the People's Daily on September 6th, I was very excited and thrilled. I seemed to see the enemy planes raging over the skies of Korea being shot down one after another by our heroic volunteers. Thinking that in less than two months, our volunteers shot down or damaged 83 enemy planes, what a great achievement this is!
    In the face of the courageous Chinese People's Volunteers, the "naval and air superiority" boasted by U.S. imperialism is nothing more than that. I thought of what General Peng Dehuai said in his article published on the "August 1st" Army Day: "The Chinese People's Volunteers have begun to establish a fairly strong people's artillery and people's air force. When we establish and use these technical arms, our combat effectiveness will be significantly enhanced, and we will achieve greater victories!"
    In the distant south of the motherland, I extend my highest respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers who are defending the motherland, defending world peace, and standing on the front line of the anti-aggression struggle!

### “与敌机作斗争”一文增强了我对敌斗争的信心

    “与敌机作斗争”一文增强了我对敌斗争的信心编辑同志：
    我读了九月六日人民日报发表的朝鲜通讯“与敌机作斗争”（李翼振作）后，非常振奋与激动。我仿佛看到肆虐在朝鲜上空的敌机，被我们英勇的志愿军一群群、一架架地打下来。想到在不到两个月的时间里，我们的志愿军就打落打伤了八十三架敌机，这是多么伟大的功绩啊！
    在勇猛的中国人民志愿军面前，美帝国主义所自夸的“海空军优势”，不过如此而已。我想到彭德怀将军在“八一”建军节发表的文章中所说的话：“中国人民志愿军已开始建立起相当强大的人民炮兵和人民空军。当我们建立和使用这些技术兵种时，我们的战斗力就会显著地加强，就会取得更大的胜利！”
    我在遥远的祖国的南方，向保卫祖国、保卫世界和平，站在反侵略斗争最前线的中国人民志愿军，致以最崇高的敬礼！
    胡明纲
