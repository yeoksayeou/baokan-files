    Dumuxiang in Huoqiu County, Northern Anhui Province, suffered from the Huai River floods last summer, resulting in a complete loss of crops. In the first phase of the Huai River project last winter and this spring, the people of the township participated in the project, receiving a large amount of wages in the form of rice, and thus survived the spring famine. Because the river was managed, all the crops were planted. This year, at the wheat harvest, the average yield per mu was 280 jin, and the total grain harvest in the township was more than 2.25 million jin. Based on a consumption of three jin of grain per person per day, this is enough to sustain the township's 4,300 people for nearly six months.

    After the Kuomintang breached the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou in 1938, this area experienced major flooding on average once every three years, each time washing away all the crops. The land was eroded by the floodwaters. The Kuomintang conscripted most of the able-bodied men, and the Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes and the landlords' cruel exploitation weighed heavily on the masses. Therefore, there was a common saying at the time: "You don't know if you'll be alive tomorrow morning." The masses had no way to produce and no desire to produce. From 1943 to 1948, the average yield per mu per year decreased to 160 jin. The whole township suffered from famine every year, and the masses lived a life worse than animals.

    When the Huai River project began, the township had a total of 1,300 laborers, who voluntarily signed up to participate in the project. Everyone unanimously expressed, "We will not go home until the Huai River is well managed." After participating in the Huai River project, the lives of the masses in the township improved. Each participant in the Huai River project, in addition to eating their fill, could still save two jin of rice to take home every day. For example, the production model Liang Suzhen, whose family of seven cultivated seven mu of poor land, never had enough grain to eat each year. After last year's flood, it was even worse. After the Huai River project began, four laborers in her family participated in the project, and they could save eight jin of grain every day. Through last year's winter repairs and this year's spring repairs, they saved more than 700 jin of grain, which they have not yet finished eating.

    After the Huai River project began, farmers saw that production was guaranteed, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. However, the majority of the main labor force in Dumuxiang participated in the Huai River project, and most of those remaining in the township were women and children, resulting in serious difficulties in spring plowing. Therefore, the township put forward the fighting slogan "Neither can we delay the Huai River project, nor can we delay spring plowing." Under the leadership of the local people's government, the remaining semi-laborers were organized by village to implement mutual aid in cultivation. Between villages and between groups, those participating in dike construction and those farming at home universally launched challenge competitions. The migrant workers on the dike assured the township, "We will not be truant, we will not cheat, and we will not go home until the Huai River is well managed"; those producing at home assured the migrant workers, "We will not leave a single mu of land uncultivated, we will not let a single person starve to death, and we will not waste the Huai River grain brought back by the migrant workers." In this way, spring plowing was done well, and the Huai River project was also done well. The Huai River project team led by Wu Jiayin, a farmer in the township, was also rated as a special-class model team. During the spring repair project, the group reached 6.3 cubic meters of earth moved per person per day. In agricultural production, the township also produced production models. For example, the 54-year-old activist Ding Qilan led women and children in production during spring plowing and challenged her son and the migrant workers. She said, "Don't think I'm old, with Chairman Mao's leadership, I can do anything." At the merit-awarding conference of labor model representatives in the Liuan Special District, she was rated as a production model for the entire special district. Wu Jiayin, who persisted on the Huai River project for seven months, was very happy to see the boundless good crops in his hometown when he returned, and said: "I didn't expect the women and children to do such a good job with the crops! Look at this endless stretch of soybeans and sweet potatoes... it's so pleasing, if the dike hadn't been built well in the spring, all the crops in the township would have been flooded again (there was a big flood in July). Now it's good, the Huai River has been managed well, and our good days are yet to come!"

### 杜母乡在治淮中变了样子

    杜母乡在治淮中变了样子
    皖北霍邱县杜母乡去年夏天遭受淮河水灾，全乡籽草无收。去冬今春第一期治淮工程中，该乡人民参加了治淮工程，得到大批工资米，度过了春荒。因为治了河，庄稼全部种上了。今年麦收时，每亩平均产粮二百八十斤，全乡共收粮食二百二十五万余斤，以每人每天需三斤粮食计算，已够维持全乡四千三百人将近六个月的生活。
    一九三八年国民党扒开花园口黄河堤以后，这里平均三年一次大水，每次大水都把庄稼淹得籽草不收。田地都被大水冲薄了。国民党把壮丁大部抽走了；国民党的苛捐杂税和地主的残酷剥削，又重重地压在群众的头上。因此，当时流行着一句俗话——“早上不知晚上死”，群众没有办法生产，也没有心情生产。一九四三年到一九四八年间，每年每亩地的平均产量，降低到一百六十斤。全乡年年闹灾荒，群众过着牛马不如的生活。
    在治淮工程开始时，全乡共有一千三百个劳动力，自动报名参加这个工程。大家一致表示：“不修好淮河不回家”。参加治淮工程以后，该乡群众的生活有了办法。每个参加治淮的人，除自己吃饱以外，每天还可剩下二斤米带回家。如生产模范梁素珍，一家七口人，种七亩坏地，每年收粮都不够吃。去年大水后更是没有办法。淮河工程开始后，她家四个劳动力都参加了治淮工程，每天可剩余八斤粮食。经过去年的冬修和今年的春修，他们共剩了七百多斤粮食，到现在还没有吃完。
    治淮工程开始后，农民眼看生产有了保障，生产情绪大大提高了。但杜母乡大部主要劳动力参加了治淮工程，乡里剩下的多是妇女儿童，春耕生产存在着严重困难。于是该乡提出“既不能耽误治淮，更不能耽误春耕”的战斗口号。在当地人民政府的领导下，以村为单位，将剩下的半劳动力组织起来，实行互助耕种。各村之间，各组之间，参加筑堤的和在家种地的，普遍展开了挑战竞赛。上堤民工向乡里保证：“不开小差，不偷巧，不治好淮河不回家”；在家生产的向民工们保证：“不荒一亩地，不饿死一个人，不浪费民工们带回来的治淮粮。”这样，就把春耕搞好了，也把淮河工程作好了。该乡农民吴家印所领导的治淮小组，且被评为特等模范小组。该组在春修工程中，每人每天抬土曾达到六点三公方。在农业生产上，该乡也出现了生产模范。如五十四岁的积极分子丁其兰老大娘，春耕时带领妇女儿童进行生产，并向她的儿子和民工挑战。她说：“别看我年纪大，有了毛主席的领导，我什么都能干。”在六安专区的劳动模范代表评功大会上，她被评为全专区的生产模范。在淮河工程上坚持了七个月的吴家印回来时，看到家乡一望无际的好庄稼，十分喜欢地说：“想不到妇女儿童把庄稼搞得这样好！你看这一眼望不到边的黄豆呀、红薯呀……多喜欢人，要不是春上把堤打好了，全乡的庄稼一定又淹光了（七月间曾涨大水）。这回好啦，把淮河治好了，我们的好日子还在后头呢！”
