    Northwest Begins Purchasing New Cotton
    State-Owned Trading Companies Have Continuously Transported Large Quantities of Materials to Cotton-Producing Areas
    New cotton from the cotton-producing areas of Northwest China has entered the market. In the southern regions of Shaanxi Province, cotton matured earlier, and the amount of new cotton entering the market has reached 70% of the total. Under the slogan of "purchase, package, and transport immediately," state-owned trading companies and cooperatives are carrying out purchasing work according to planned schedules. After undergoing patriotic education on selling and storing cotton, cotton farmers in various areas are selling the cotton they have harvested to the state at any time. Cotton farmers in the Yunyang District of Sanyuan County, central Shaanxi, immediately ginned and delivered 2,000 jin of new cotton to the cooperative after harvesting it. State-owned trading companies in Chenggu and other counties in southern Shaanxi can purchase more than 15,000 jin of new cotton daily.
    This year, the cotton field area in the Northwest region has expanded by about 10% compared to last year, and the cotton is generally growing well. The total output is expected to exceed last year's by a factor of one. To complete the purchasing tasks in a timely manner and supply the needs of yarn factories, the relevant departments in the Northwest region have made full preparations for purchasing new cotton. A cotton purchasing guidance committee has been established in the entire region, responsible for supervising, inspecting, and uniformly allocating purchasing resources. The Trade Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, has stipulated the purchasing prices for major distribution centers in cotton-producing areas and formulated cotton management measures and plans for unified purchasing and overall supply of materials. In addition to expanding organizations at all levels for large-scale purchasing, the State-Owned Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company has also signed consignment purchasing contracts with other state-owned trading companies and cooperatives. For private cotton firms, the State-Owned Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company, in addition to organizing them to purchase on its behalf, also recruits their cotton inspection technicians to participate in the purchasing work. The State Bank has also launched cotton storage services. Local Chinese Communist Party organizations and People's Governments are also vigorously carrying out patriotic cotton selling publicity work. To supply the material needs of cotton farmers after selling cotton, state-owned trading companies have continuously transported large quantities of prepared materials to cotton-producing areas. In areas without state-owned trading organizations, the supply of materials is the responsibility of cooperatives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西北开始收购新棉
    国营贸易公司已把大批物资陆续运到产棉地区
    西北产棉区新棉业已上市。陕西省南部地区棉花成熟较早，新棉上市量已达全部棉花上市量的百分之七十。国营贸易公司和合作社在“随收购、随打包、随转运”的口号下，正按照预定计划展开收购工作。各地经过爱国主义售棉储棉教育的棉农，都将他们摘收的棉花随时卖给国家。陕西中部三原县云阳区棉农刚收下二千斤新棉，马上轧好送到合作社。陕西南部城固等县国营贸易公司每天可收新棉一万五千多斤。
    西北区棉田面积今年较去年扩大百分之十左右，棉花生长普遍良好，预计总产量可超过去年一倍。为了及时完成收购任务，供给纱厂需要，西北区各有关部门曾作了充分的收购新棉的准备工作。全区棉花采购指导委员会已经成立，负责督促检查及统一调配收购力量。西北军政委员会贸易部已根据中央人民政府贸易部的指示，规定了产棉区各主要集散地的收购价格，并制定了棉花管理办法和统一收购、统筹供应物资的计划。国营花纱布公司除已扩大各级组织以便大量收购外，并与其他各国营贸易公司、合作社订立了委托代购合同。对于私营花行，国营花纱布公司除组织他们代购外，并吸收其棉花检验技术人员参加收购工作。国家银行也开展了储棉业务。各地中国共产党组织、人民政府也大力进行爱国售棉的宣传工作。为供应棉农出售棉花后的物资需要，各国营贸易公司已将准备好的大批物资陆续运到产棉区。没有国营贸易机构的地区，物资供应由合作社负责。（新华社）
