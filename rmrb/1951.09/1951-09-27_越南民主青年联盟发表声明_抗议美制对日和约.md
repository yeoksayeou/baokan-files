    Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report from North Vietnam on September 23rd: People from all walks of life in Vietnam have expressed their most indignant protest against the signing of the separate U.S.-Japan peace treaty by the United States. The Executive Committee of the Vietnamese Democratic Youth League recently issued a statement vehemently protesting the separate U.S.-Japan peace treaty signed in San Francisco by the U.S. imperialists and their vassal states. The statement emphasized that this separate treaty is invalid because the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which played a decisive role in the war to defeat Japanese fascism, did not sign the treaty. The statement said: "The Vietnamese Democratic Youth League, representing Vietnamese youth who fought against Japanese fascists and are now fighting against French fascists, pledges to unite more closely with the world's democratic youth and the people of all countries in order to smash the war plots of the U.S. imperialists and their vassals."

    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十三日讯：越南各阶层的人民对美国单独对日和约的签字，提出了最愤慨的抗议。越南民主青年联盟执行委员会最近发表声明，猛烈抗议美帝国主义者和他们的仆从国家在旧金山签订单独对日和约。声明着重指出：这个单独和约是无效的，因为在击败日本法西斯主义的战争中起决定性作用的苏联和中华人民共和国都没有在这个和约上签字。声明说：“越南民主青年联盟代表曾与日本法西斯进行斗争现在又与法国法西斯分子进行斗争的越南青年，保证将与世界民主青年和各国人民更紧密地团结起来，以便粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的仆从的战争阴谋。”
