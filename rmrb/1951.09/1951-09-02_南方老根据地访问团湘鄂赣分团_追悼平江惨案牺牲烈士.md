    The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi sub-group of the Central People's Government's Southern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group held a memorial meeting on August 18th in Jiayi Township, Pingjiang County, Hunan, to commemorate martyrs such as Kuang Zhengkun, who were murdered by the Kuomintang bandit gang in the Pingjiang Massacre, and revolutionary martyrs of the Pingjiang Old Revolutionary Base. More than 500 people attended the memorial meeting, including representatives of the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary servicemen, families of revolutionary workers, representatives of emancipated peasants, and people from all walks of life. The Pingjiang Massacre occurred on June 12, 1939, when Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang attacked the New Fourth Army's rear guard office in Pingjiang, brutally murdering Kuang Zhengkun and seven other martyrs.

    The family members of the martyrs who died in the Pingjiang Massacre, including Kuang Zhengkun's son, Kuang Mingtao, sent a special telegram to Chairman Mao. The telegram recounted the suffering they endured under the Kuomintang reactionaries, saying: "The Kuomintang reactionaries repeatedly came to our home to search and loot, even taking rags and scraps. They also called us 'Communist wives' and 'Communist children,' saying they would exterminate us. But we were proud of this. Because Communists are the most progressive and noble people in the world, we feel infinitely honored to be the family members of Communists." They then reported on their happy lives after liberation under the care and help of the People's Government, and then said: "What excites us especially is that Yang Zhuben, one of the heinous KMT secret agents and murderers who committed the Pingjiang Massacre and slaughtered revolutionary patriots, has been executed in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Today, the Central Visiting Group held a memorial meeting at the Martyrs' Cemetery in Jiayi Ridge. This reminds us of the reactionaries' atrocities and deepens our hatred for the enemy. Therefore, we must respond to your call, carry forward the revolutionary tradition; we must actively participate in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and promote production, play an exemplary leading role in the movement, and strive for greater glory to repay your deep concern for us."

    南方老根据地访问团湘鄂赣分团  
    追悼平江惨案牺牲烈士
    八月十八日，中央人民政府南方老根据地访问团湘鄂赣分团，在湖南平江县嘉义乡举行追悼平江惨案遭国民党匪帮杀害的?正坤等烈士暨平江老根据地革命烈士大会。参加追悼会的有革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属的代表、翻身农民代表及各界人士五百余人。平江惨案发生于一九三九年六月十二日，蒋介石匪帮袭击新四军驻平江后方留守处，惨杀?正坤等八烈士。
    平江惨案殉难烈士家属、?正坤烈士的儿子?鸣涛等特致电毛主席。电文中诉述他们受国民党反动派摧残的情形说：“国民党反动派无数次到我们家里来搜索抢劫，连破衣烂布都抢走。并且还说我们是“共党婆”、“共党崽”，说要把我们斩尽杀绝。但我们却以此为荣。因为共产党人是世界上最进步最高尚的人，我们能作共产党人的家属，也感到无上光荣。”他们接着报告了解放后他们在人民政府的关怀、帮助下的幸福生活，然后说：“使我们特别兴奋的是：万恶的蒋匪特务、制造平江惨案屠杀革命志士的凶手之一杨柱本已在镇压反革命运动中被枪决了。今天，中央访问团在嘉义岭烈士墓前举行了追悼大会。这使我们回想起反动派的暴行，更加深了我们对敌人的仇恨。因此，我们一定要响应你的号召，发扬革命传统；我们要积极参加抗美援朝，镇压反革命及生产运动，在运动中起模范带头作用，争取更大的光荣，来回答你对我们这样深切的关怀。”（新华社）
