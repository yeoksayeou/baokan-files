Introducing the Discussion in New Hunan Daily on the Thought of Li Sixi
    Long Mu
    Starting from July 18th, New Hunan Daily initiated a discussion on "Li Sixi Thought" in the newspaper. This issue was raised based on a specific analysis of the actual work in rural Hunan and the main problems in the thinking of cadres. As of this writing, the discussion has been going on for more than a month, with good results, and is continuing to be widely and deeply discussed.
    The so-called "Li Sixi Thought" refers to a kind of lax and complacent thinking that appeared among rural cadres after the completion of land reform. Li Sixi was originally a poor farmhand who worked as a long-term laborer for more than ten years and suffered a lifetime of hardship before he married and had children after liberation. During the land reform, he worked very actively and was elected secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. But after the land reform was completed and he was allocated land, he was unwilling to work anymore and just wanted to go home and concentrate on production. When cadres tried to persuade him, he became anxious and cried, saying, "I suffered all my life without land. Now that I have been allocated land, I am satisfied. Why should I continue to do revolution?" This kind of thinking among peasant cadres was quite common. In rural North China, after the land reform was completed and Chiang Kai-shek was driven away, this "theory of revolutionary success" also emerged among district and village cadres. Some people who had been very active gradually became political mediocrities, content with "thirty acres of land, an ox, a wife, children, and a warm bed." The party organizations in North China used great effort to fight against this kind of thinking. In areas where land reform has been completed, it is necessary to pay attention to the emergence of this kind of thinking and correct and overcome it through education.
    New Hunan Daily decided to hold this discussion because it saw that although this kind of thinking was not yet the majority among all cadres, it had already caused serious consequences in rural work. The newspaper pointed out that due to the existence of this kind of thinking, "many village cadres want to 'take long leave,' resign, and some even leave without the approval of their superiors, packing up their bedding and leaving. No one is in charge of village work. … With the cadres like this, the peasants are even less motivated, and universally relax control over the landlords. This situation naturally facilitates the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries. At the end of April, illegal landlords in the fifth district of Hanshou, a township that had already undergone land reform, launched an armed rebellion, causing heavy losses to the people. In April and May, counter-revolutionaries in the countryside spread rumors, poisoned people, and committed arson, becoming even more rampant." After May 1st, the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea gradually penetrated the countryside, but it did not reverse this situation. Obviously, if this phenomenon is not changed and this kind of thinking is not overcome, it will cause our work to stagnate and greatly damage the achievements we have already made. It is an important ideological task to wage a resolute struggle against this backward thinking of complacency.
    Because the issue was raised pertinently, the New Hunan Daily's discussion on Li Sixi Thought achieved good results. Many village cadres and peasants expressed their opinions, held discussion meetings, and conducted self-criticism. Many county and district party secretaries and county and district heads also wrote articles and letters to the newspaper to participate in the discussion. On August 25th, Wang Shoudao, Second Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, also wrote a paper entitled "Criticize Li Sixi Thought and Strengthen Cadre Ideological Education." The discussion is continuing to deepen based on Comrade Wang Shoudao's paper. This discussion reflects a series of issues that deserve widespread attention.
    This discussion exposed the prevalence and various manifestations of the so-called "Li Sixi Thought." Many rural cadres and peasants examined their own "Li Sixi Thought": they mistakenly believed that "the land reform is completed, everything is fine," as if this was the success of the revolution. They relaxed their vigilance against class enemies, thinking that "the world is at peace" and they could "bury themselves in production." They regarded revolutionary work as a "burden," thinking that it should be "done in shifts," and that "there are many poor and lower-middle peasants, why should I be the only one to suffer." There were many different forms. The discussion analyzed the root causes of this kind of thinking. In his paper, Comrade Wang Shoudao pointed out that those with Li Sixi Thought have a narrow political vision and do not understand that the Chinese people today must continue the new democratic revolution to the end, and will inevitably move towards the bright future of socialism in the future. Therefore, after being allocated land, they "are satisfied with the status quo, unwilling to continue to work hard to strive for a better future, only see their current personal interests, bury themselves in production, do not care about national affairs, and do not care about politics." They cannot see that class enemies still exist, that American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and all domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces still exist, and that it is necessary to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, strive for lasting world peace, and advance towards socialism and communism in order to have a truly permanent liberation. They "lost their revolutionary vigilance and fighting will, disarmed themselves, and gave the enemy an opportunity to exploit." The emergence of this kind of erroneous thinking is not accidental. "Li Sixi Thought is by no means unique to Li Sixi himself. It is a narrow, selfish, and backward thinking of small private producers that Chinese peasants have developed under the long-term dispersed small-scale peasant economy." To criticize the erroneous "Li Sixi Thought" is to use the thought of Marxism-Leninism to overcome the backward thinking of peasant small producers. Chairman Mao pointed out that "the serious problem is to educate the peasants." This kind of ideological struggle within the people is of great significance.
    Li Sixi Thought has its class roots. However, the main reason for allowing this kind of thinking to develop is that in practical work, ideological education for rural cadres and peasants has been neglected, and the political orientation in rural work has been ignored. Some letters in the discussion reflected the serious shortcomings in this regard. According to Comrade Chen Bingzhi, Secretary of the Fourteenth District Committee of Xiangyin County: "For example, in the land reform, the main method used by working cadres to mobilize the masses was simply to use economic interests to motivate them. The ideological mobilization was not enough, so that the enthusiasm of village cadres declined with the completion of the land reform. Some district cadres only publicize current interests and neglect long-term interests; some only publicize personal interests and neglect the interests of the entire revolution, making the selfish ideas of the peasants more and more serious." These comrades abandoned the ideological and political content of practical work, and in their work, they departed from ideological leadership, and as a result, instead of overcoming erroneous and backward thinking, they even helped to foster this kind of thinking. This is precisely a serious manifestation of not asking about political orientation. In his paper, Comrade Wang Shoudao pointed out: Many cadres "do not understand the important significance of strengthening political and ideological education, are accustomed to using shock work methods to carry out work, and are not good at enlightening and raising the ideological awareness of the masses in their work; they are often satisfied with completing tasks in form and numbers in a certain time and place, neglecting the political purposes and long-term interests of various tasks, and are not good at connecting various tasks with the general line and general policy of the revolution to educate village cadres." This is precisely the manifestation of not asking about political orientation in various works, and it is also the main reason for allowing Li Sixi Thought to develop. This discussion in the New Hunan Daily specifically proves the necessity of "attaching importance to the ideological education of cadres...and conducting systematic and regular education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought for cadres in various struggles."
    Due to the neglect of ideological education for cadres, an erroneous leadership method will arise. The discussion in the New Hunan Daily reflected that some village cadres regard revolutionary work as a "burden" and advocate "doing it in shifts." For these phenomena, poor leadership methods must also bear a certain responsibility. Some leading organs "only require village cadres to complete heavy work tasks, but do not specifically guide and help them solve various difficulties in their work; when village cadres make some mistakes in their work, they cannot patiently educate, persuade, and help them correct them, but simply criticize and blame them. They also lack due consideration, care, and concern for their family life and production difficulties. All of this makes them feel that they are 'getting no credit for their efforts' and are 'being criticized from three sides' (leadership criticism, mass criticism, and criticism from their wives at home), 'it is better to quit as soon as possible'." Even when discussing and criticizing Li Sixi Thought, some people still believe that the reason why village cadres are slack is because "the tasks are not heavy enough" and advocate using the method of "压任务" [putting pressure through assigning tasks] to overcome it. Can this kind of crude bureaucratic leadership method still be tolerated? This discussion in the New Hunan Daily specifically illustrates the necessity of improving the leadership methods for village cadres. And the fundamental key to achieving this improvement lies in strengthening ideological and political leadership; overcoming the simple task view, and placing the strengthening of cadres' ideological and political level and the improvement of their work ability in the primary position.
    In the discussion on "Li Sixi Thought," the New Hunan Daily powerfully criticized the narrow and backward thinking developed by a part of rural cadres due to the living conditions of small producers with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which is very necessary. Chairman Mao taught us that we must "educate ourselves and transform ourselves on a nationwide and overall scale with democratic methods, so that we can break away from the influence of internal and external reactionaries (this influence is still very great now and will exist for a long time and cannot be quickly eliminated), transform the bad habits and bad ideas we have acquired from the old society, not allow ourselves to go on the wrong path guided by the reactionaries, and continue to advance towards socialist society and communist society." This is a serious task on the ideological front. The criticism of "Li Sixi Thought" is a part of this self-education and self-transformation work of important significance.
    After the New Hunan Daily launched the discussion on Li Sixi Thought, it has received certain effects. Opposing Li Sixi Thought has become the battle cry of village cadres, a weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and whoever has the idea of simply engaging in production to get rich will be criticized with it. Therefore, after discussing this issue in many places, the slack thinking of village cadres was corrected, and the village cadres who had already carried their luggage home returned to the township office, and those who were uneasy also became settled. Some also formulated patriotic covenants, "guaranteeing to resolutely carry on to the end and never slack off." At the same time, improving the leadership methods for village cadres and strengthening political and ideological education have attracted the attention of many county and district leading organs. Many district and township cadres have also begun to attach importance to improving their ideological level and have seized the study of the history of the Communist Party of China, which is currently underway.

    介绍新湖南报关于李四喜思想的讨论
    龙牧
    新湖南报从七月十八日起在报纸上展开了关于“李四喜思想”的讨论。这个问题是根据湖南农村实际工作和干部思想中的主要问题的具体分析而提出的。迄至执笔时止，讨论已进行了一个多月，有了很好的成绩，还在继续广泛而深入地讨论着。
    所谓“李四喜思想”是指在土地改革完成后，出现在农村干部中的一种松懈麻痹思想。李四喜原是一个贫苦的雇农，做了十多年的长工，受了一辈子苦，解放后才娶妻生子。在土地改革中，他工作非常积极，并当选为青年团支部书记。但土地改革完成后，他分了田，便不愿再工作，而只想回家去专门搞生产了。干部去劝说他时，他竟急得哭起来，说：“我一生受苦没得田，现在分了田，我已经心满意足了，还要干革命干什么？”农民干部中的这种思想是有相当大的普遍性的。华北农村中土地改革完成并打走了蒋介石之后，区村干部中也产生了这种“革命成功论”，有些本来很积极的人渐渐变成了政治上的庸人，满足于“三十亩地一头牛，老婆娃娃热炕头”的生活。华北的党组织曾用很大的力量和这种思想斗争。在已经完成土地改革的地区注意这种思想的萌生，通过教育来纠正和克服这种思想是很必要的。
    新湖南报决定举行这个讨论，就因为看到这种思想在全体干部中虽然还不是多数，但已在农村工作中造成了严重的后果。该报指出，由于存在着这种思想，“许多乡村干部要‘请长假’，辞职不干，有的甚至不经过上级批准，就卷起被窝自己走了。乡村工作没有人管。……干部这样，农民更提不起劲来，普遍放松管制地主。这种情形自然便利反革命分子的破坏活动。四月底，汉寿五区已经过土地改革的乡不法地主武装暴乱，使人民受到很大的损失。四五月间，农村反革命分子造谣、放毒、纵火，更猖狂了。”五一以后，抗美援朝爱国主义运动逐渐深入农村，但还没扭转这种情势。显然，这种现象如果不改变，这种思想如果不克服，就会使我们的工作停滞不前，而且会大大地损害已有的成绩。和这种苟且偷安的落后思想进行坚决的斗争，是一个重要的思想工作。
    由于问题提得切中要害，新湖南报关于李四喜思想的讨论获得了良好的成绩。许多乡村干部和农民群众发表了意见，开了讨论会，进行了自我批评。有许多县、区委书记和县、区长也给报纸写稿写信，参加讨论。八月二十五日，中共湖南省委第二书记湖南省人民政府主席王首道同志也写了题为“批判李四喜思想加强干部思想教育”的论文。讨论正根据王首道同志的论文继续深入开展下去。这个讨论反映了一系列的问题，值得引起普遍的重视。
    这个讨论暴露了所谓“李四喜思想”的普遍程度和各种表现形式。许多农村干部和农民检讨了自己的“李四喜思想”：他们误认为“土改完成、万事大吉”，似乎这便是革命成功了。他们放松了对阶级敌人的警惕，认为“天下太平”，可以“埋头生产”。他们把革命工作看做一种“负担”，认为应该“轮流干”，“贫雇农很多，为什么要我一人吃亏”。种种形式不一而足。讨论中分析了这种思想产生的根源。王首道同志在他的论文中指出：这些有李四喜思想的人，他们政治眼光狭小，不了解今天中国人民是要把新民主主义革命继续进行到底，将来还必然要走向社会主义的光明前途，因此在分了田地之后，他们就“满足于现状，不愿继续努力工作去争取更美好的将来，只看到目前的个人利益，埋头生产，不关心国家大事，不过问政治”。他们看不清阶级敌人还存在，美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮及一切国内外反革命势力还存在，必须巩固人民民主专政，争取世界持久和平，并向社会主义和共产主义前进，才能有真正永久的翻身。他们“丧失了革命的警惕性和斗争意志，解除了自己的武装，给敌人以可乘之机”。这种错误思想的产生不是偶然的，“李四喜思想决不是李四喜个人所特有的，这是中国农民处在长期分散的小农经济的生产方式下，所养成的一种小私有生产者的狭隘、自私的落后思想。”批评错误的“李四喜思想”，就是以马克思列宁主义的思想去克服农民小生产者的落后思想。毛主席指出“严重的问题是教育农民”，这种人民内部的思想斗争，是有重要意义的。
    李四喜思想是有其阶级根源的。但是放纵这种思想发展起来的主要原因，是在实际工作中忽视了对农村干部和农民群众的思想教育工作，是由于农村工作中的不问政治倾向。讨论中有一些信件反映了这一方面的严重缺点。据湘阴县第十四区区委书记陈秉芝同志说：“譬如在土地改革中，工作干部发动群众的主要方法就是单纯用经济利益去鼓动，思想发动很不够，以致乡村干部的热情随着土地改革完成而低落下来了。有些区干部只宣传目前利益，忽视长远利益；有些只宣传个人利益，而忽视了整个革命的利益，使农民的自私观念越来越厉害了。”这些同志在工作中抛弃了实际工作的思想和政治内容，在工作中离开了思想领导，结果不是克服错误落后的思想，甚至反助长这种思想。这正是不问政治倾向的严重表现。王首道同志在他的论文中指出：有许多干部“不了解加强政治思想教育的重要意义，习惯于用突击工作方式来进行工作，而不善于在工作中启发与提高群众的思想觉悟；他们往往满足于一时一地在形式上数字上完成任务，忽视各项工作的政治目的与长远利益，不善于将各项工作与革命的总路线总方针联系起来去教育乡村干部”。这正是各种工作中的不问政治倾向的表现，也就是放纵李四喜思想发展起来的主要原因。新湖南报的这个讨论具体地证明了“重视对干部的思想教育工作……在各种斗争中，对干部进行系统的、经常的马列主义和毛泽东思想的教育”的必要性。
    由于忽视对干部的思想教育，就会产生一种错误的领导方法。新湖南报的讨论中反映出有一些乡村干部视革命工作为“负担”，主张“轮流干”。对于这些现象，不好的领导方法也要负一定的责任。有一些领导机关“只要求乡村干部去完成繁重的工作任务，而不去具体指导和帮助他们解决各种工作中的困难；当乡村干部在工作中犯了一些错误时，又不能耐心地进行教育说服帮助改正，只是单纯地批评指责。对他们的家庭生活与生产困难也缺乏应有的体贴、关怀和照顾。所有这些，就使他们感到‘费力不讨好’，‘三头受气’（领导批评、群众批评、回家老婆也批评），‘不如早日下场’”。甚至在讨论批判李四喜思想时，仍有人认为乡村干部之所以松气，是由于“任务压得不够”，主张用“压任务”的方法来加以克服。这种粗暴的官僚主义的领导方法，难道还能够容忍么？新湖南报的这个讨论具体地说明了改善对乡村干部的领导方法的必要性。而实现这种改进的根本关键，是在于加强思想政治领导；克服单纯的任务观点，把加强干部的思想政治水平和提高其工作能力放在首要的地位。
    新湖南报在关于“李四喜思想”的讨论中，用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想有力地批判了在一部分农村干部中由于小生产者的生活条件而养成的狭隘落后的思想，这是非常必要的。毛主席教导我们，要“在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展”。这是思想战线的严重任务。关于“李四喜思想”的批判就是这种有重要意义的自我教育和自我改造工作中的一部分。
    新湖南报关于李四喜思想的讨论展开之后，已经收到了一定的效果。反对李四喜思想已成为乡村干部的战斗口号、批评和自我批评的武器，谁有单纯生产发家的思想，就以此进行批评。因此许多地方讨论了这个问题后，纠正了乡村干部的松气思想，原来已背着行李回家了的乡村干部重回乡公所，不安心的也安心了。有的并订出爱国公约，“保证坚决干到底，决不松气”。同时，改善对乡村干部的领导方法，加强政治思想教育，已经引起了许多县区领导机关的注意。许多区乡干部也开始重视提高自己的思想水平，抓紧了正在进行中的中国共产党党史的学习。（新华社）
