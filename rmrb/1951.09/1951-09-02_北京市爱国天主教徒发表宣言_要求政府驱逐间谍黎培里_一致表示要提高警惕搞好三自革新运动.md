[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Beijing Catholics have issued a declaration demanding that the government permanently expel Libri, a degenerate element within the Catholic Church, an imperialist element, and a spy, from China. As of August 31st, over eight thousand Catholics had signed the declaration.

The imperialist element Libri, the Vatican's "ambassador" to the Kuomintang reactionary government, arrived in China on December 14, 1946. He consistently used the Chinese Catholic Church to oppose the Chinese people. During the Liberation War, in coordination with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, Libri openly declared that the Catholic Church would assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "nation-building work" and deployed counter-revolutionary work in various important dioceses. At the same time, he intensified the development of the Catholic Church's reactionary secret organization – the "Legion of Mary" – in various places, engaging in sinful counter-revolutionary activities. After the liberation of Nanjing, he continued to maintain contact with reactionary imperialist organizations, colluding with and shielding foreign spies, and inciting Catholics to resist the People's Government. His crimes have been successively exposed by patriotic Catholics in various places. The American government's special agent and spy, Maddie Nao, was sentenced to life imprisonment in Beijing. Maddie Nao was Libri's "Beijing representative," further confirming that the pawns dispatched by Libri were doing evil throughout China, serving American imperialism, and antagonizing the Chinese people. The broad masses of patriotic Catholics in Beijing are extremely resentful of Libri's crimes and have been holding meetings, issuing declarations, and launching signature campaigns for days, resolutely demanding that the People's Government drive Libri out of China.

The patriotic Catholics in various districts of Beijing denounced Libri's crimes in their declarations. The declaration of the Catholics of the East Church in the First District stated: "We good Catholics have been severely persecuted by him (referring to Libri) for a long time. He made us forget our motherland and turn our backs on the people, living an ignorant life under his sinister clutches." The declaration stated: "Now we are awake and know that our motherland is lovable, and we must protect our motherland; we also know that the Catholic Church in China should be run by Chinese Catholics themselves. We hate imperialism and hate the imperialist element Libri even more. All of us Catholics resolutely demand that the government drive the imperialist element Libri out of China." The Catholics in the Third District, in their declaration, exposed Libri's crimes of colluding with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and resolutely opposing the Chinese people's cause of liberation. The declaration revealed that after the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, Libri organized the counter-revolutionary organization "Legion of Mary," using the Catholic Church as a cover to carry out destructive activities against the Chinese people in various places. Libri repeatedly issued so-called "orders" and "instructions" hostile to the Chinese People's Government to the Chinese Catholic Church and threatened all patriotic and law-abiding bishops, priests, and Catholics in the Catholic Church with means such as "deprivation of divine authority" and "abandonment," obstructing them from participating in the Catholic Church's patriotic reform movement and the Chinese people's patriotic activities to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In their declarations, the Catholics in the Catholic churches in various districts of Beijing unanimously demanded that the People's Government resolutely expel the imperialist element in the Catholic Church, Libri, from Chinese territory immediately, and not allow him to use the Catholic Church to undermine the cause of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people any longer.

Patriotic Catholics in various districts of Beijing are now enthusiastically signing the declaration demanding that the government expel Libri, which is a high tide in the patriotic reform movement of Catholics in Beijing. Many Catholics affixed their seals and signatures to the declaration, solemnly expressing their determination to expel Libri. Li Baojuan, a Catholic student from the Zhuxin Primary School attached to the Guang'an Catholic Church in the Eighth District, said when signing: "My pen is a gun, and I must drive Libri out of China." Hundreds of orphans and Catholics who had been oppressed by imperialism for many years at the Renci Church in the Fifth District, when signing the declaration demanding Libri's expulsion, raised their fists and shouted: "We will no longer be oppressed by imperialism!" After signing, the Catholics at the Hebochang Catholic Church in the Sixth District applauded for a long time, expressing their excitement.

The enthusiastic situation in the signature campaign demanding that the government expel Libri shows that the patriotic enthusiasm and political consciousness of the Catholics in Beijing have been greatly improved. They recognize that expelling the imperialist element and spy in the Catholic Church, Libri, from China is the duty of patriotic Catholics; it is not only not apostasy, but also protecting the Catholic Church, maintaining the purity of the Catholic doctrine, and preventing it from being contaminated by imperialist elements and special agents and spies. Mrs. Zhou, a Catholic at the Niupaizi Hutong Catholic Church in the Third District, said to others signing: "Libri is not a 'papal envoy' at all, he is just a special agent and spy ringleader; you see, in the recent special agent and spy cases cracked in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places, many special agents and spies were under his command." Xu Wenlu, a priest at the West Church in the Fourth District, said: "In the past, I was deceived by imperialism and thought that expelling Libri was related to religious dogma, but now I realize that Libri is an imperialist element, and Maddie Nao is his accomplice. We cannot let these degenerates stay in the Catholic Church in China and undermine our country, we should drive them out." A Catholic who pedaled a rickshaw said: "Regardless of whether he is an envoy or not, if he is an imperialist element, I will have to drive him out of China. The bad guys in the church spread rumors that it is a sin to sign and bombard the 'envoy', but in fact, bombing imperialist elements and spies is not only not a sin, but also a patriotic action." Catholics Zhang Yishou and others, after many people signed, said: "We must not only resolutely expel the imperialist element Libri, but also heighten our vigilance in the future and not allow bad elements to lurk in the Catholic Church, and strive to improve the Three-Self Reform Movement."

    北京市爱国天主教徒发表宣言
    要求政府驱逐间谍黎培里
    一致表示要提高警惕搞好三自革新运动
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市天主教徒发表宣言，要求政府将天主教中的败类、帝国主义分子和间谍黎培里，永远驱逐出中国。在宣言上签名的天主教徒，到八月三十一日为止，已达八千余人。
    帝国主义分子黎培里，是梵蒂冈教廷派驻国民党反动政府的“公使”，于一九四六年十二月十四日来到中国。一贯利用中国天主教会反对中国人民。在解放战争期间，黎培里为配合蒋匪作战，曾公然宣称天主教要辅助蒋介石匪帮的“建国工作”，并到各个重要教区布置反革命工作。同时加紧在各地发展天主教的反动秘密组织——“圣母军”，进行反革命的罪恶勾当。南京解放后，他继续与帝国主义的反动组织保持联系。并勾结与掩护外国间谍分子，煽动天主教徒对抗人民政府。他的罪行已经陆续被各地爱国的天主教徒所揭发。美国政府特务间谍马迪懦在北京被判处无期徒刑，马迪懦是黎培里的“北京代表”，更证实黎培里所派遣的爪牙，在中国各地为非作恶，给美帝国主义服务，与中国人民为敌。北京市广大的爱国天主教徒对黎培里的罪行痛恨万分，连日举行会议，发表宣言，展开签名运动，坚决要求人民政府把黎培里赶出中国去。
    北京市各区的爱国天主教徒，在宣言中控诉黎培里的罪行。第一区东堂天主教徒的宣言中说：“我们善良的教友，长时期受着他（指黎培里）的严重迫害，他使我们忘掉了祖国，背离了人民，在他的阴谋魔掌下，过着愚昧的生活。”宣言说：“现在我们清醒了，知道我们祖国的可爱，我们要保护自己的祖国；也知道中国的天主教要中国教友自己来办。我们痛恨帝国主义，更痛恨帝国主义分子黎培里，我们全体教友坚决要求政府把帝国主义分子黎培里赶出中国去。”第三区的教徒们，在宣言中检举黎培里勾结美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，坚决反对中国人民解放事业的罪恶。宣言中揭露黎培里在中国人民革命胜利之后，组织反革命团体“圣母军”，以天主教为掩护，在各地进行反对中国人民的破坏活动。黎培里曾向中国天主教会屡次发布敌视中国人民政府的所谓“命令”、“指示”，并以“摘神权”，“被弃绝”等为手段，威胁天主教中一切爱国守法的主教、神甫和教徒们，阻挠他们参加天主教的爱国革新运动和中国人民抗美援朝的爱国活动。北京市各区天主教堂的教徒们，在宣言中一致要求人民政府，坚决把天主教中的帝国主义分子黎培里，立即驱逐出中国国土，不容许他再利用天主教来破坏中华人民共和国和中国人民的事业。
    北京市各区爱国天主教徒现正踊跃在要求政府驱逐黎培里的宣言上签名，这是北京市天主教徒爱国革新运动的一次高潮。许多教徒在宣言上盖章画押，郑重表示驱逐黎培里的决心。第八区广安天主堂附设铸新小学的公教学生李宝娟在签名时说：“我的笔就是一枝枪，一定要把黎培里赶出中国去。”第五区仁慈堂受帝国主义压迫多年的几百个孤儿和教徒，在要求驱逐黎培里出境的宣言上签名时，举拳高呼：“我们再不受帝国主义的压迫了！”第六区河泊厂天主堂的教徒们在签名以后，全体作长时间鼓掌，表示他们兴奋的心情。
    在要求政府驱逐黎培里的签名运动中的热烈情况，说明北京市天主教徒们的爱国热情和政治觉悟是大大的提高了。他们认识了驱逐天主教中的帝国主义分子、间谍黎培里出中国，是爱国天主教徒应尽的责任；不仅不是叛教，并且正是爱护天主教，保持天主教教义的纯洁，使它不被帝国主义分子和特务间谍的沾污。第三区牛排子胡同天主堂的教徒周太太，对其他签名的人说：“黎培里根本不是什么‘教廷公使’，他只不过是个特务间谍头子；你们看，最近北京、天津各地破获的特务间谍案子中，好多特务间谍都是受他指挥的。”第四区西堂神甫徐文禄说：“以前我受帝国主义的蒙蔽，认为驱逐黎培里是牵连教义的，现在我认清了，黎培里就是个帝国主义分子，马迪懦是他的帮凶，这些败类，不能让他们留在中国的天主教中破坏咱们的国家，应该把他们撵出去。”一个蹬三轮的教徒说：“管他公使不公使，是帝国主义分子我就得轰他滚出中国去。教中的坏蛋们造谣说，签名轰‘公使’有罪，其实轰帝国主义分子、间谍不仅没罪，并且是爱国行动。”教徒张义寿等候许多人签名之后说：我们不但要坚决驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里，以后还要提高警惕，不许天主教中潜伏坏分子，努力搞好三自革新运动。
