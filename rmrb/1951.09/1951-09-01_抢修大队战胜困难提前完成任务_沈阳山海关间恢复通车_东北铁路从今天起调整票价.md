The Shenyang-Shanhaiguan Railway flood damage repair project was completed at 10:00 AM on the 29th, and the Shenshan line officially resumed passenger and freight transport in the afternoon. The Shenshan line, from Gaotaishan Station to Masanjia Station, suffered from flash floods from the Liao River on the 17th, with 276 breaches along a 28-kilometer section of the line, and the 30-meter-wide roadbed of Juliuhe Station was also destroyed. The Shenshan line was thus interrupted. Yu Guangsheng, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Railways stationed in the Northeast, and Deputy Special Commissioner Su Mei, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene and formed an emergency repair team of more than 6,700 employees from 65 units within the jurisdiction. The emergency repair team worked for nine days and nights, overcoming various difficulties, rebuilding five bridges, and filling 271 sinkholes, completing the repair task two days ahead of schedule according to the Ministry of Railways' instruction to restore traffic by September 1st. Thus, all lines in the Northeast that suffered from flood damage have been fully repaired and reopened to traffic. (Xinhua News Agency)

After the unification of the national currency, in order to unify ticket prices inside and outside the customs, the ticket prices of Northeast Railways (including the Chinese Changchun Railway) have been adjusted with the approval of higher authorities, starting from September 1st of this year. Passenger ticket prices (including express tickets, student season tickets, and sleeper tickets) will increase by 10%, that is, based on the current basic ticket price in the Northeast of 98.53 yuan per person per kilometer, it will be adjusted to 109 yuan. The baggage freight rate will be reduced by 37.2%, that is, from 1.74 yuan per kilogram per kilometer to 1.1 yuan per kilogram per kilometer. The adjusted baggage freight rate is now in line with the current freight rates of the northern and southern railways. (Iron)

    抢修大队战胜困难提前完成任务
    沈阳山海关间恢复通车
    东北铁路从今天起调整票价
    沈（阳）山（海关）铁路水害抢修工程已于二十九日上午十时竣工，下午沈山线即正式恢复客货运输。沈山线自高台山站到马三家站间曾于十七日遭受辽河山洪水害，在二十八公里长的一段线路上被冲开二百七十六个缺口，巨流河站的三十公尺宽的路基亦被毁坏。沈山线遂告中断。铁道部驻东北特派员余光生、副特派员苏梅闻讯后，即赶赴现场，在管内六十五个单位中组成了六千七百余名员工的抢修大队。抢修大队历时九昼夜，克服种种困难，重建桥梁五座，填平水坑二百七十一个，按铁道部限九月一日修复通车的指示，提前两天完成抢修任务。至此东北境内遭受水害的线路已全部修复通车。（新华社）
    全国货币统一后，为统一关内外票价，东北铁路
    （包括中国长春铁路）票价经上级核准，自今年九月一日起加以调整。旅客票价（包括加快票，学生定期票，睡铺票价）增加百分之十，即按东北现行基本票价，每人每公里九八点五三元，调整为一○九元。行李运价率减低百分之三十七点二，即由每公斤每公里一·七四元减为每公斤每公里一·一元。调整后的行李运价率，已与北、南方铁路现行运价率划一。（铁）
