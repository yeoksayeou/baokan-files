    Beijing Catholic Weiran Hutong Parish Reform Committee
    Writes to Chairman Mao, Endorsing the Government's Expulsion of Archbishop Riberi
    Resolutely Drawing a Line with Imperialism, and Doing a Good Job in the Catholic Reform Movement

    Respected Chairman Mao:
    We Catholics have long been threatened, bullied, numbed, and fooled by imperialist elements cloaked in religious garb. We have endured their oppression with anger and shame, with nowhere to complain. Today, with your wise leadership, our Catholic believers have raised our awareness. With the support of the people of the whole country, we Catholics have stood up and waged a resolute struggle against the imperialist elements, exposed their false charitable masks, and revealed their true hideous faces. We Catholics have removed ideological obstacles, recognized the distinction between the enemy and ourselves, and embraced the motherland. We thank you for your kindness and love towards us. The People's Government, representing the will of the entire Chinese people, expelled Archbishop Riberi, the American imperialist spy whom we hate to the core, from China on September 4th. This makes us rejoice and be encouraged. We thank the government for standing up for us, so that we will no longer be oppressed by imperialist elements. In a mood of heartfelt gratitude and extreme excitement, we write to you to pay our most lofty respects. We assure you: we must resolutely unite, never compromise with imperialism, and take practical actions to eliminate the reactionary forces and counter-revolutionary elements within Catholicism, and do a good job in our Catholic Reform Movement. We want to stand together with the people of all China, and under your wise leadership, fight to the end for the construction of our motherland. Finally, we sincerely wish you good health! Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

    给毛主席写信拥护政府驱逐黎培里
    坚决和帝国主义划清界限，搞好天主教革新运动敬爱的毛主席：
    我们天主教徒过去长期受着身披宗教外衣的帝国主义分子的威胁欺凌，麻痹愚弄。我们含怒忍羞地受着它们的压迫而没有地方去申诉。今天，有了您英明的领导，我们天主教徒提高了觉悟。在全国人民的支援下，我们天主教徒站起来和帝国主义分子进行了坚决的斗争，揭破了它们的假慈善面具，使它们露出了本来的狰狞面目。我们天主教徒解除了思想上的障碍，认清了敌我界限，投向祖国的怀抱。我们感谢您对我们的恩爱。人民政府代表全中国人民的意志，在九月四日把我们恨入骨髓的美帝国主义的间谍黎培里驱逐出中国去。这使我们欢欣鼓舞。我们感谢政府给我们做主，使我们再不受帝国主义分子的欺压。我们在衷心感谢和极端兴奋的情绪下，写信向您致最崇高的敬礼。我们向您保证：我们要坚决团结起来，永远不与帝国主义妥协，并以实际行动来肃清天主教内的反动势力和反革命分子，搞好我们天主教革新运动。我们要和全中国人民站在一起，在您英明的领导下，为祖国的建设事业而奋斗到底。最后，我们谨祝您身体健康！中国共产党万岁！北京市天主教魏染胡同教区革新委员会
