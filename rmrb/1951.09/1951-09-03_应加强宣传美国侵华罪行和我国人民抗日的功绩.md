    Should Strengthen Propaganda on American Crimes of Aggression Against China and the Merits of Our People's Resistance Against Japan
    To the Editor:
    American imperialism convened the San Francisco Conference, attempting to legitimize the so-called "peace treaty with Japan," which aims at permanently occupying Japan and preparing for a war against China and the Soviet Union. It also vainly attempted to deny the great struggle of the Chinese people against Japanese imperialism since the September 18th Incident and deny the right to speak for a great power with a population of 475 million. Its arrogance and unreasonableness have reached their extreme. At the same time, it sabotaged the Kaesong neutral zone, murdered our military police, and even plotted to assassinate our delegation participating in the negotiations, and even reversed black and white, categorically denying the facts of the murder and bombing witnessed and heard by millions of people in Kaesong. Its shamelessness and rascality have also reached their extreme. Today, we should recognize that American imperialism has become so狂暴愚蠢卑鄙龌龊 violent, stupid, despicable, and filthy that it surpasses the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists. Compared with Hitler, the barbarity and cruelty of the Truman clique are in no way inferior, and their shamelessness and rascality are even worse. Not only that, but the recent evil conspiracy of American spies Li Andong, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, and others, who were executed in Beijing, to assassinate our national leaders, fully demonstrates the enemy's sinister, vicious, and vile nature. In dealing with such an enemy, we must not have the slightest illusion or the slightest relaxation. We must be vigilant at all times, strictly prevent麻痹 paralysis, and use practical actions to support the government, support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and crush all the despicable conspiracies of American imperialism!
    In order to make the people of the whole country deeply aware of the enemy's nature and to thoroughly eliminate the residual influence of the enemy's past deceptive propaganda, we should further expand the propaganda on the historical facts of American imperialism's consistent aggression against our country. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, it initially helped Japan attack China, then aided the Jiang bandits in attacking the people, and under the banner of joint resistance against Japan, seized our country's sovereignty from the traitorous Jiang bandit gang government. This series of crimes needs to be fully exposed. At the same time, the historical facts of the Chinese people's resolute resistance against Japan and defeating the Japanese invaders under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party also need to be more widely publicized. Only in this way can the true face of history be fully revealed. We must let the people of the whole country and even the world fully recognize two historical truths: American imperialism has consistently invaded China; the Japanese imperialists were defeated by the Chinese people. The United States' separate peace treaty with Japan is illegal and is a great insult to the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never tolerate such unreasonable behavior.

    应加强宣传美国侵华罪行和我国人民抗日的功绩编辑同志：
    美帝国主义召开旧金山会议，企图把目的在于永久占领日本，准备反对中苏战争的所谓“对日和约”合法化，还妄想一手遮天否认中国人民从九一八以来的反抗日本帝国主义的伟大斗争，否认有四亿七千五百万人口的大国的发言权；其狂妄悖理已经到了极点。同时，它又破坏开城中立区，杀害我方军事警察，甚至图谋杀害我方参加谈判的代表团，还颠倒黑白矢口否认开城千万人所眼见耳闻的谋杀轰炸的事实；其无耻无赖也达到了极点。我们今天应该确认：美帝国主义已经是狂暴愚蠢卑鄙龌龊到了超过德意日法西斯的程度；比起希特勒来，杜鲁门之流的野蛮残忍是毫无逊色，而无耻无赖更有过之而无不及。不仅此也，最近在北京处决的美国特务李安东、山口隆一等的企图暗害我国元首的罪恶阴谋，又充分显出了敌人的阴险狠毒与下流已到了什么地步。对付这样的敌人，我们万不能存丝毫的幻想与丝毫的松懈；我们必须时刻警惕，严防麻痹，并且用实际行动来拥护政府，拥护周外长声明，粉碎美帝国主义的一切卑鄙阴谋！
    为了使全国人民深刻认识敌人的本质，并且澈底肃清敌人过去欺骗宣传的残余影响，我们应该更加扩大宣传美帝国主义一贯侵略我国的罪恶史实。尤其是抗战时期中它始而帮助日本进攻中国，继而援助蒋匪进攻人民，并在共同抗日的旗号下从卖国的蒋匪帮政府手中攫取我国主权，这一连串罪行更需要充分地揭露。同时，中国人民在中国共产党领导下坚决抗日打垮日寇的史实也还需要更广泛的宣传。这样才能使历史的真正面目完全显现。我们要让全国乃至全世界人民充分认识两条历史真理：美帝国主义一贯侵略中国；日本帝国主义是中国人民打败的。美国单独对日媾和是非法的，是对中国人民的极大侮辱，中国人民决不能容忍这种无理行为。北京大学  金克木
