Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 30th: The Soviet people are enthusiastically supporting the resolution of the Soviet Peace Committee on launching a signature campaign for a declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. Workers, collective farmers, scientists, and cultural workers in various regions have held rallies to discuss this resolution and unanimously expressed their support for the World Peace Council's declaration. At a mass rally held at the Moscow Machine Building Factory, lathe operator Simagin said: "The resolution of the Soviet Peace Committee is in line with the interests of the Soviet people. The Soviet people are engaged in peaceful communist construction, and they will enthusiastically sign the peace pact declaration." Shchigatulov, a rolling mill worker at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad, said: "The voice of the Soviet people demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact will merge with the great voice of 450 million people around the world participating in the signature campaign. For the victory of peace, we must step up production and unite more closely around the great standard-bearer of peace, Stalin." The workers of the Kiev Traffic Signal Machine Factory also expressed their willingness to actively participate in the signature campaign for the peace pact declaration at a mass rally.

Many famous Soviet writers, Stakhanovite workers, and collective farmers have published articles in newspapers to defend peace and have called on the Soviet people to participate in the signature campaign. The famous writer Sholokhov said: "All working people oppose war and demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. The brave hearts of the Soviet people have been tested in the great battles to defend the cause of Lenin and Stalin. The joint efforts of the people of the world will surely defend peace." The famous composer Shostakovich said that the world peace movement is a great force against the instigators of new wars, and all Soviet cultural workers should actively participate in the signature campaign.
