    Supporting Gromyko's Speech and Opposing the US-Made Treaty with Japan

    (I) Editor:

    Gromyko delivered a righteous and forceful speech at the San Francisco conference on September 5th. With irrefutable logic, he explained the great contributions of the Soviet Union and Asian countries—especially China—in the long Anti-Japanese War. He pointed out that the basic principle for concluding a treaty with Japan is to ensure that Japan does not become an aggressive fascist again, and, inseparably related to this, to establish a democratic order in Japan. Gromyko relentlessly exposed the shameless conspiracy of the US-made treaty with Japan. US imperialism attempts to restore fascist rule and militarism in Japan through the "signing" of the "treaty," dreaming of enslaving the Japanese people and turning them into cannon fodder for launching new wars. Gromyko also put forward five amendment clauses and eight new clauses proposed by the Soviet Union regarding territorial reparations, preventing US imperialism from continuing to station troops in Japan, and restricting Japan's military buildup. This fair and reasonable proposal represents the demands of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of the world. We firmly support it. We will never recognize the absurd "treaty" concluded with Japan by US imperialism and its follower countries. We will use all our actions to support Gromyko's solemn proposal and strive for the realization of a genuine and comprehensive treaty with Japan.

    (II) Editor:

    After reading the speech of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko at the San Francisco conference, I sincerely thank the Soviet Big Brother for upholding justice. As the speech said, "In the struggle against Japanese aggression, the Chinese people defended their independence and shouldered the main burden of resisting this aggression. They made an inestimable contribution to the struggle against Japanese militarists, thereby accelerating the final victory of freedom-loving people." The Chinese people, after a long and arduous war of resistance, achieved victory thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party and the assistance of the Soviet Big Brother. Today, US imperialism openly wants to rearm Japan, and we resolutely oppose it. We support Premier Zhou's solemn statement and Gromyko's truthful suggestions on behalf of the Soviet Union regarding the treaty with Japan. In my work, I will work doubly hard to ensure that, under the leadership of my superiors, the sidewalk repair survey work in Tianjin's First and Tenth Districts is completed as soon as possible, and the survey record form must be carefully calculated.

    (III) Editor:

    After seeing Gromyko's speech at the San Francisco conference on September 5th, I felt deeply relieved. Every sentence and every word of this righteous and forceful speech contains infinite power, thoroughly exposing the truth about the US-British draft treaty with Japan and the San Francisco conference! The conspiracy tactics consistently used by US imperialism have once again been exposed to the peace-loving people of the world.

    The US imperialist draft treaty with Japan is absurd and outrageous. It is perfidious and violates previous international agreements, attempting to achieve the ambition of indefinitely enslaving Japan in order to invade Asia and the Far East and dominate the world. But this absurd dream cannot be realized. The peace and democracy camp headed by the socialist Soviet Union is growing unprecedentedly day by day, which is an irresistible force. The Chinese people have bravely stood up under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao. We have enough power to smash any aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism!

    Despite the mad barking and biting of US imperialism, this treaty cannot have any effect, because this signing is illegal. As early as August 15th, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai had already solemnly declared: "The draft treaty with Japan proposed by the US and British governments is a draft that undermines international agreements and is fundamentally unacceptable," and "The San Francisco conference is also a conference that abandons international obligations and is fundamentally unrecognisable." This fully represents the attitude of all the Chinese people towards the US-British treaty with Japan and the San Francisco conference.

    Therefore, through this incident, we have a clearer understanding of the wolfish aggressive nature of US imperialism. So we must better carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, vigorously increase production and donations, consolidate our national defense forces, support our volunteer army, eliminate more enemies, break off the claws of US imperialism, and win the victory in the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea as soon as possible in order to defend the lasting peace of the world.

    (IV) Editor:

    After studying Premier Zhou's statement on August 15th, we unanimously realized that the US imperialist's creation of the draft treaty with Japan is an illegal act that violates the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation. The US imperialist conference held in San Francisco on September 4th to sign the treaty with Japan openly excluded the People's Republic of China, which had made the greatest contribution to the Anti-Japanese War. Through this conference, we have further recognized the vicious conspiracy of US imperialism. It attempts to legally occupy Japan for a long time and continue to occupy our country's Taiwan and the Penghu Islands after the treaty is signed. And it妄想 use Japan's manpower, material resources and bases to launch a new war of aggression, threatening Asia, invading China, and destroying world peace.

    We unanimously expressed our firm support for Premier Zhou's statement and our full support for the just proposal of Soviet representative Gromyko on September 5th. And decided to take practical actions to improve work efficiency, ensure the implementation of the patriotic convention, continue to deepen the propaganda of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and complete the task of increasing production and donations ahead of schedule, in order to strengthen national defense forces, and unite the peace-loving people of the world to completely smash the aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism and defend the permanent peace of the world.

### 拥护葛罗米柯演说反对美制对日和约

    拥护葛罗米柯演说反对美制对日和约
    （一）编辑同志：
    葛罗米柯九月五日在旧金山会议上发表了义正词严的演说。他以无可辩驳的逻辑，说明了苏联和亚洲各国——特别是我国在长期抗日战争中的伟大贡献。指出对日缔结和约的基本原则，是确保日本不再变为侵略的法西斯主义者，以及与此相关而不可分的必须建立日本的民主秩序。葛罗米柯无情地揭露了美制对日和约的无耻阴谋，美帝国主义想借“和约”的“签订”恢复日本法西斯统治和军国主义，梦想奴役日本人民，将他们变作发动新战争的炮灰。葛罗米柯又提出了苏联关于领土赔款，制止美帝国主义在日本继续驻军，限制日本增军等五项修正条款和八项新添条款。这个公正合理的建议，代表了中国人民、日本人民以及全世界人民的要求，我们坚决拥护。我们决不承认美帝国主义及其仆从国家对日缔结的荒谬“和约”。我们要用一切行动支持葛罗米柯严正的建议，为实现真正的全面对日和约而奋斗。

    （二）编辑同志：
    我读了苏联副外长葛罗米柯在旧金山会议中的演说，衷心感谢苏联老大哥声张正义，正如演说中所说“中国人民在反抗日本侵略的斗争中，保卫自己的独立，肩负起反抗这种侵略的斗争的主要负担，他们对反对日本军国主义者的斗争作了无可估计的贡献，从而加速了爱好自由的人民的最后胜利”。中国人民经过长期的艰苦抗战，由于共产党毛主席的正确领导和苏联老大哥的援助，取得了胜利。今天，美帝国主义竟公然要重新武装日本，我们坚决反对。我们拥护周外长庄严声明及葛罗米柯代表苏联关于对日和约的真理建议。在工作上我要加倍努力，保证在上级领导下，把天津市一区和十区的便道补修勘查工作早日完成，做勘查纪录表一定精打细算。

    （三）编辑同志：
    我看到葛罗米柯九月五日在旧金山会议上的演说之后，从内心里感到痛快。这篇义正词严的演说，每一句话，每一个字，都含着无穷的力量，痛快淋漓地揭穿了美英对日“和约”草案和旧金山会议的真相！美帝国主义一贯使用的阴谋伎俩，又一次在全世界爱好和平人民的面前被揭穿了。
    美帝国主义的对日“和约”草案是荒谬绝伦的。它背信弃义违反了历次国际协定，企图实现无限期奴役日本，以达到侵略亚洲和远东并霸占全世界的野心。但这种荒唐的梦想是不能实现的。以社会主义苏联为首的和平民主阵营是一天天地空前壮大起来，这是一股不可抗拒的力量。中国人民在中国共产党和英明领袖毛主席的领导下勇敢地站立起来了，我们有足够的力量粉碎美帝国主义任何的侵略阴谋！
    尽管美帝国主义疯狗般地乱叫、乱咬，这个和约毫不能发生任何效力，因为这次签字是非法的。早在八月十五日我国周恩来外长就已经庄严声明过：“美英两国政府所提出的对日和约草案是一件破坏国际协定基本上不能被接受的草案”，“旧金山会议也是一个背弃国际义务基本上不能被承认的会议”。这完全代表了我全中国人民对待美英对日和约及旧金山会议的态度。
    因此，我们通过这一事件，更加清楚地认识了美帝国主义豺狼性的侵略本质。所以我们要更好地展开抗美援朝运动，大力增产捐献，巩固国防力量，支援我们志愿军，消灭更多的敌人，打断美帝国主义的侵略魔爪，早日取得抗美援朝战争的胜利，以保卫世界的持久和平。

    （四）编辑同志：
    我们学习了周外长八月十五日的声明以后，一致认识到美帝国主义一手制造对日和约草案，是一件破坏开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告的非法行为。美帝国主义九月四日在旧金山召开的签订对日和约的会议，竟公然将在抗日战争中功绩最大的中华人民共和国排斥在会外。通过这次会议我们更认清了美帝国主义的恶毒阴谋，它企图在和约签定后，便可自认合法的长期占领日本和继续霸占我国的台湾和澎湖诸岛。并妄想利用日本的人力、物力和基地发动新的侵略战争，威胁亚洲、侵略中国，破坏世界和平。
    我们一致表示坚决拥护周外长的声明，和全力支持九月五日苏联代表葛罗米柯正义的建议。并决定以实际行动来提高工作效率，保证实行爱国公约，继续深入抗美援朝的宣传，提前完成增产捐献的任务，以加强国防力量，并团结全世界爱好和平的人民，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，保卫世界永久的和平。铁道部材料局支工会人事秘书小组
