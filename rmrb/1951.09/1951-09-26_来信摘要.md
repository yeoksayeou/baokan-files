Letter Excerpts

	The Meizhuang Cooperative in Fengrun sells goods with inaccurate scales;
	Public suggestions are not corrected.
	Since the merger of the Meizhuang Village Cooperative in the Twelfth District of Fengrun County, Hebei Province, with the Gaotuo and Zhaojiakou first-class cooperatives this spring, individual salespersons often sell goods with inaccurate scales (sometimes short, sometimes excessive). The masses have a lot of opinions about this careless style.
	On August 21st of this year, I bought 30,000 yuan worth of fertilizer at the cooperative, which should have been 14 jin and 4 liang according to the market scale. When I carried it back and weighed it with several scales, I found it was short 1 jin and 12 liang. Later, I carried it back to the cooperative and they made up the difference after I explained the situation. The cooperative manager said that the salesperson had misread the scale and would pay more attention in the future. Such things happened several times later. For example, Song Ruchen bought 10 jin of fertilizer at the cooperative and got 5 liang extra. Sun Lianxiang and Song Xizhong each bought 10 jin and were short half a jin. This proves that the salespersons of the cooperative have a careless style and have not corrected it well based on the opinions of the masses.

	The People's Hospital in Shulu County, Hebei Province,
	is irresponsible for patients' lives.
	This summer, I took three children from Beijing back to my parents' home in Xincheng Town, Shulu County, Hebei Province, to visit relatives. After arriving in Xincheng Town, my third daughter suddenly fell ill with diarrhea, fever, drowsiness, nausea, and loss of appetite. I took her to the local People's Hospital for treatment. Dr. Zhang of the hospital thought it was a minor fright and not important. The next day, seeing that her condition was not good, I took her to the People's Hospital again. Dr. Zhang prescribed a dose of medicine, which made the diarrhea worse. Two days later, the child was very ill, but Dr. Zhang did not hurry to check the condition, only gave a few packages of ready-made medicine, and that was it. I asked him to diagnose in detail, and if the condition was serious, to rush back to Beijing to save her life. But Dr. Zhang guaranteed: "It's just a minor fright, nothing, don't worry, it will be fine in a few days." At this time, my second daughter also fell ill, with the same symptoms as the third daughter. I asked Dr. Zhang to treat her again. After examining her, he determined that it was transmitted by the third daughter, saying that she could take the little girl's medicine and there was no need to prescribe another prescription. Although I don't understand medicine, I have never heard that fright can be contagious. That very night, the third daughter died. I immediately rushed back to Beijing and sent the second daughter to Peking University Hospital for treatment, and she is still not out of danger.
	The health and lives of the tens of thousands of people in Shulu County depend on the People's Hospital for protection. I hope that the People's Hospital of Shulu County will investigate Dr. Zhang and similar instances of irresponsibility for patients' lives, so that similar incidents will not happen again.

	Suggestions for Promoting Hospital Appointment Systems
	The Beijing People's Third Hospital has adopted the advanced Soviet experience and implemented an appointment system for outpatient services. I think this system is very good and should be promoted. In the past, it took me about two and a half hours from registration to the end of the consultation each time I went to see a doctor. But since the implementation of the appointment system, each of my two consultations has only taken 25 minutes, saving me more than two hours each time.
	Although this system is good, some comrades often do not go to see the doctor at the time agreed with the doctor, which affects the doctor's plan for seeing patients and also affects other patients from seeing the doctor on time. Therefore, I suggest that comrades who see a doctor abide by the appointment system, go to the hospital on time, and at the same time, the hospital can also stipulate certain methods to ensure that the appointment system can be well implemented.

    来信摘要
    丰润么庄合作社卖货斤秤不准
    群众提出意见也不改正
    河北省丰润县第十二区么庄村合作社今春与高坨、赵家口头等合作社合并后，个别售货员卖货，常常斤秤不准（有时不足，有时多余），群众对这种粗枝大叶的作风很有意见。
    我今年八月二十一日在该社买三万元肥田粉，按市秤应给十四斤零四两多。我背回去借了几杆秤对称，发现短少一斤十二两。后来我又背回合作社，经说明后给我补上了。合作社经理说是卖货员看错了秤，以后要多注意。这类事情后来又发生几次，如宋汝臣到该社买十斤肥田粉，多了五两，孙连祥、宋锡忠各买十斤，又都缺少半斤。由此足证该社的售货员有粗枝大叶作风，并没有根据群众的意见很好的纠正。

    河北束鹿县人民医院
    对病人生命不负责任
    今夏我由北京带三个孩子回河北束鹿县新城镇娘家省亲，到新城镇后，我的第三个女儿突然患病，泻肚、发烧、昏睡、恶心、不进饮食。我把她抱至当地人民医院就诊。该院张大夫认为是小儿惊吓，无关紧要。第二天我看她病情不好，又抱至人民医院，张大夫开了一剂药，服后肚泻更厉害了。过了两天，孩子病得不像样了，而张大夫不赶快检查病况，只给了几包现成的药，就算了事。我要求他详细诊断，如果是病情严重，就火速赶回北京挽救生命。但张大夫一口保证：“小儿惊吓，没什么，你放心，过几天定会好。”这时我的第二个女孩也病了，病情跟三女完全一样。我又请张大夫诊治。他检查之后，断定是三女传染的，说分吃小女的药就行了，不用另开方。我虽不懂医理，但从未听说惊吓还会传染的。就在当晚，三女死了。我立即赶回北京，将二女送进北大医院就诊，至今尚未脱离危险期。
    束鹿县千万人民的健康及生命，是仰仗人民医院来卫护的。我希望束鹿县人民医院对张大夫及类似张大夫此种对病人生命不负责任的事情，加以检查，使以后不再有同样的事情发生。

    建议推广医院门诊预约制
    北京市人民第三医院接受苏联的先进经验，实行了门诊预约制。我觉得这个制度很好，应该推广。过去我去看一次病，从挂号到看病完结，大约要两个半钟头的时间。但实行了预约制后，我两次看病，每次都只要二十五分钟，每次节省了两个多钟头的时间。
    这个制度虽然好，但因有些同志常常不按与医生所约定的时间前去看病，影响了医生看病的计划性，也影响了其他患者按时就诊。因此我建议看病的同志们遵守门诊预约制度，按时到院看病，同时院方也可规定一定的办法，保证门诊预约制能很好执行。  读者  陈文学
