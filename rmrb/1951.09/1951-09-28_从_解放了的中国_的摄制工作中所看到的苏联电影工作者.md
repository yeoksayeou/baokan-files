What I Saw of Soviet Filmmakers During the Production of "Liberated China"
Zhou Libo

Because I participated in the production of the film "Liberated China," which later won the Stalin Prize, I spent a whole year with Soviet filmmakers. This year, spent first in Beijing and then in Moscow, is deeply memorable and worth savoring.

The Soviet filmmakers sent to China were all excellent artists. They worked diligently for a year, embracing the spirit of internationalism and love for China, in order to depict the life and struggle of the Chinese people and their leaders.

The director of "Liberated China," Gerasimov, was a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and a People's Artist of the Soviet Union who had won the Stalin Prize several times. He came from a working-class background in the Urals. His works possess profound ideological depth. His bald head and sparkling eyes made it clear at a glance that he was a clever man accustomed to contemplation. He was also a passionate artist, his fiery enthusiasm cloaked in a mantle of clear reason.

He accepted the task of portraying the new China. But to portray the new China, it was necessary to narrate its origins, to concisely record the history of the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders leading the Chinese people in a long struggle. This was a very important, but also very large and difficult-to-express theme. Especially the historical part, events have passed, and it is difficult to find the action-oriented image of the characters, and the action of the characters is the soul of the art of film. Without characters, only scenery, without action and plot, only static things, this is a difficult subject to deal with in the art of film.

Based on the script repeatedly revised by the leading comrades, and through the close cooperation of Gerasimov and everyone, this film was finally produced. It truthfully, succinctly, and vividly portrays the new China and its origins.

In order to understand China, Gerasimov always had many Russian books about China on his bedside table, and after work during the day, he would read at home.

Thinking and reading are indispensable preparatory work for those engaged in art. We often see some young comrades who have rich life experiences, or have stayed in factories and rural areas for a long time, but still can't write anything. This is because they have not made ideological preparations, do not have the artistic vision, and cannot see things in reality. To have an artistic vision, one must do a lot of ideological and artistic preparatory work to sharpen one's eyes, be good at seeing problems, and also be good at thinking in images.

Gerasimov's preparatory work was not limited to thinking and reading, but also to diligent conversation. He talked with leading comrades in the central and local governments many times. I remember that on the way to Jiangxi, we were in the same car as Comrade Zhang Yunyi. One day, we were chatting in the dining car, and Comrade Zhang Yunyi mentioned Chairman Mao's work style. Gerasimov listened carefully and was very interested. He was deeply interested in all conversations about the history of our Party and other situations.

In addition to talking with leading comrades, he also talked with some ordinary working comrades and participated in some symposiums. All this was to make this film well.

We talked a lot together. We talked about land reform, Yan'an, martyrs, the Long March, and stories and writings of Chairman Mao. Once, we talked about Chairman Mao's sentence: Two big mountains are pressing on the heads of the Chinese people: feudalism and imperialism. Gerasimov laughed enthusiastically: "How vivid this sentence is!" Later, he wrote this sentence into the commentary of the film, and skillfully expressed it with artistic pictures.

In the entire part of the film depicting the old China, Gerasimov used Chairman Mao's above-mentioned sentence as the ideological foundation.

In order to reflect feudal oppression and the struggle against feudalism, the film focuses on depicting land reform. At that time, land reform was being carried out near Beijing, and they filmed it nearby. It is said that when the land reform footage was sent to Moscow, it was praised as much as the footage of Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Square.

The historical facts of the imperialists bullying China are too numerous to record. If it were before liberation, we could have filmed the British and American warships on the Huangpu River, and the thousands of kinds of atrocities committed by British constables and American soldiers against the Chinese people. But after liberation, the British and American warships on the Huangpu River have already fled, and the various atrocities of British constables and American sailors are no longer seen on the Chinese mainland.

One day, I happened to mention that I had been in prison in the Shanghai Western Prison. Gerasimov happily said that this was important material. He personally took the photographer to see the shooting location, angle, and background one day in advance, and went to shoot the next day. Thus, this huge ten-story prison built in China by the Anglo-American imperialist group was left in this film as a vestige of the invading claws of Anglo-American imperialism. This will deeply touch the people in the colonies who are still suffering under the claws of imperialism.

In the anti-imperialist section, there is also the tragic scene of American planes bombing Shanghai. Gerasimov also selected footage from past black-and-white films of British and American patrolmen supervising executions and shooting Chinese people. These will make our people always and firmly remember the blood debts of the Anglo-American aggressors.

The Soviet comrades paid great attention to the tradition of patriotism in Chinese history, and attached great importance to the artistic creation of labor. The gold plaque of "Righteous Spirit of Heaven and Earth" in the Yue Temple, the magnificent Forbidden City, the beautiful Temple of Heaven, the Great Wall, and the majestic stone Buddha were all incorporated into the film as the excellent moral traditions and artistic heritage of the Chinese people.

In the long struggle history of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Chairman Mao, there are countless moving deeds. In order to express these heroic deeds and shoot these commemorative sites, the Soviet comrades went to the vicinity of Jinggang Mountain, to Chairman Mao's hometown, to Nanchang, Ruijin, and Yan'an, and shot many precious materials. It is a pity that some commemorative sites are not easy to express in documentary films. For example, Jinggang Mountain is the earliest revolutionary base established by Chairman Mao, and it has epoch-making significance in the history of the Chinese revolution. But if you only shoot the static peaks and cliffs on the mountain, and let the vast number of people who have not been to Jinggang Mountain see it, what is the difference between it and the mountains and cliffs in other places? After considering it, Gerasimov, in addition to using a panorama of Jinggang Mountain, also inserted an oil painting, so that the historical event of the meeting of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in Jinggang Mountain was expressed.

When we arrived in Yan'an, we saw many valuable commemorative sites, but some were destroyed by the Chiang bandits, and some were not cleaned up. The three stone kilns in Zaoyuan where Chairman Mao lived were not destroyed because the Chiang bandits did not know that they were Chairman Mao's former residence, but they were empty. What furniture did Chairman Mao have when he lived there? How was it arranged? We have no way of knowing. The only person who had been to Chairman Mao's home before and was still in Yan'an last year was the commissioner of the Yan'an Prefectural Office. We arranged the interior furnishings of Chairman Mao's former residence based on his memories and preserved it in this film.

There are very many pleasant images of liberated China, and it is relatively easy to shoot, but where to start from thousands of clues? What to focus on? Gerasimov grasped the important materials of workers' and peasants' labor, the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, culture and art, and the defense of peace, and succinctly and vividly expressed the main dynamics of the new China.

The Soviet photographers made meticulous preparations even when shooting a very short scene, and never acted rashly. They made full investigations in advance of the places they were going to shoot. They carefully studied and carefully considered the light and dark, angle, composition, and background of the picture. Some of them did not like to use light handheld Eymo cameras, but preferred to use a heavy camera. Although this camera was heavy, it had wooden legs supported on the ground when shooting, so it would not shake, and the picture taken would not tremble at all, and the situation of the picture "dancing" that they often ridiculed would not occur.

Music and sound are also organic parts of the film, and must be well coordinated to make them a harmonious whole with the picture. In the scene of the May 30th Massacre, there were gunshots in the sound, the gunshots of imperialists massacring Chinese demonstrators. We felt that the gunshots were weak. Nesterov, who recorded the sound, said that the May 30th Massacre was a kind of memory in this film. If the gunshots were too loud, people would feel that it was a real event in front of them. The gunshots must be vague to show that it is a recollection of a distant past.

After a year of efforts by Chinese and Soviet film workers, "Liberated China" was successfully produced. Now this film has won the glorious First Class Stalin Prize. This is the glory of Chairman Mao, the glory of all the people of the new China he led to liberation, and it is also another clear symbol of the indestructible and deep friendship between China and the Soviet Union. In the process of making this film, my contribution was very small. Attached to the end, I also received a lofty award. Here, in addition to expressing personal gratitude, I would like to express my deep gratitude and lofty respect to all the Soviet comrades who participated in the work of this film.

Finally, let us bless Stalin and Chairman Mao, and wish them longevity. (Attached picture)

    从“解放了的中国”的摄制工作中所看到的苏联电影工作者
    周立波
    因为参加了后来获得斯大林奖金的影片“解放了的中国”的摄制工作，我和苏联电影工作者相处了整整一年。先在北京，后在莫斯科的这一年间的日子，是深深地值得纪念，值得回味的。
    派来中国的苏联电影工作者都是优秀的艺术家。他们抱着热爱中国的国际主义的精神，为了表现中国人民及其领袖的生活和斗争，辛勤地工作了一年。
        “解放了的中国”的编导格拉西莫夫是苏联最高苏维埃代表，是获得了几次斯大林奖金的苏联人民艺术家。他是乌拉尔工人出身。他的作品具有深刻的思想性。光秃的头顶和闪烁的眼睛，使人一看就知道是一位惯于思索的聪明的人物。他又是一位热情奔放的艺术家，他的火一样的热情包裹在明晰的理性的外衣里。
    他接受了表现新的中国的任务。但要表现新中国，必需叙述她的由来，必需概括地、简洁地记述中国共产党及其领袖领导中国人民进行长期斗争的历史。这是一个非常重要，但也非常庞大，不易表现的主题。尤其是历史的部分，事件过去了，很难找到人物的行动性的形象，而人物的行动正是电影艺术的灵魂。没有人物，光有景色，没有行动和情节，只有静止的事物，这在电影艺术上是难于处理的题材。
    凭着领导同志再三修改了的脚本，经过格拉西莫夫和大家密切的合作，这部影片终于制成了。它真实，扼要，而又生动地表现了新的中国和她的由来。
    为着了解中国，格拉西莫夫的床头桌上总是摆着许多关于中国的俄文书籍，白天的工作完了以后，他就在家里阅读。
    思索和阅读，是从事艺术的人的不可缺少的准备的工作。我们常常看见一些年青的同志，生活经历很丰富，或是在工厂和农村里呆了很久，但还是写不出东西，这是因为他们没有思想的准备，没有艺术的眼力，在现实里看不出东西来的缘故。要有艺术的眼力，必须要做思想上和艺术上的许多准备的工作，使得自己的眼睛锐敏起来，善于看问题，并且也善于作形象的思索。
    格拉西莫夫的准备工作，不只限于思索和阅读，也勤于谈话。他找中央和地方的领导同志谈过许多次。记得我们去江西的路上，和张云逸同志同车，有一天，在餐车里闲谈，张云逸同志提到了毛主席的工作作风，格拉西莫夫用心听着，很感兴趣。凡是关于我们党的历史以及其他一切情形的谈话，他都感到浓厚的兴趣。
    除了和领导同志谈话以外，他也找一些普通的工作同志谈话，参加一些座谈会，这一切，都是为了制好这影片。
    我们在一起，谈得很多。我们谈土地改革，谈延安，谈烈士，谈长征，谈毛主席的故事和著作。有一次，我们谈到了毛主席的这句话：在中国人民的头上压着两座大山：封建主义和帝国主义。格拉西莫夫热情地笑道：“这话多么生动呵。”往后，他把这句话写进了影片的解说里，并且用艺术的画面巧妙地把它表现出来了。
    在影片的整个描写旧中国的部分，格拉西莫夫是用毛主席的上述这句话作为思想的基础的。
    为了反映封建压迫和反对封建的斗争，影片着重地描写了土地改革。那时候，北京附近正在进行着土地改革，他们就近拍制了。据说，土地改革的画面送到莫斯科去时，曾和天安门上的毛主席的镜头
    一样地受到赞扬。
    帝国主义者欺压中国的史实，是罄竹难书的。要是在解放以前，我们可以拍摄黄浦江上的英美的军舰，可以拍摄英国巡捕和美国兽兵欺压中国人民的千万种暴行。但解放以后，黄浦江上的英美的军舰已经逃跑了，英国巡捕和美国水兵的种种暴行在中国大陆上也看不到了。
    有一天，我偶然提到我在上海西牢坐过牢。格拉西莫夫欢喜地说，这是重要的材料。他亲自带着摄影师先一天去看好了拍摄的地点，角度和背景，第二天就去拍摄了。于是，英美帝国主义集团在中国修建的这座有十层楼房的巨大的监狱，作为英美帝国主义的侵略魔爪的遗痕，留在这影片里了。这会使得那些至今还在帝国主义魔爪之下遭受灾难的殖民地的人民发生深刻的感触的。
    在反帝的篇幅里，还有美机轰炸上海的凄惨的场面，格拉西莫夫又从过去的黑白片的材料里，选取了英美的巡警监刑和枪杀中国人民的镜头，这些，都会使得我们的人民，永远地、牢牢地记住英美侵略者们的血债的。
    苏联同志非常注重中国历史上的爱国主义的传统，非常重视劳动的艺术的创造，岳庙的“乾坤正气”的金匾，壮丽的故宫，优美的天坛，伟大的长城和雄伟的石佛，这些，都被当作中国人民的优良的道德传统和艺术遗产，摄入了影片。
    中国共产党和他的领袖毛主席的长期的斗争历史中，有无数可歌可泣的事迹。为了表现这些英雄的事迹，拍摄这些纪念地点，苏联同志到过井冈山附近，到过毛主席的家乡，到过南昌、瑞金和延安，拍摄了许多珍贵的材料。可惜的是，有些纪念地，不容易在记录电影里表现。比方，井冈山是毛主席建立的最初的革命根据地，它在中国革命历史上是有划时代的意义的。但要是光拍了山上的静止的峰峦和崖石，让广大的没有到过井冈山的人们看着，它和其他地方的山峦和崖石有什么区别呢？格拉西莫夫考虑到最后，除了用一幅井冈山的远景以外，还插了一张油画，这样，就把毛主席和朱总司令在井冈山会师的历史事件表现出来了。
    我们到了延安，看到了许多可贵的纪念地，可是有的被蒋匪毁坏了，有的没有收拾。毛主席住过的枣园的三面石窑，因为蒋匪不知道是毛主席故居，没有被毁，但里面空空荡荡，毛主席居住时，有些什么家具？怎么样摆设的？我们都无从知道。从前到过毛主席家里，去年还在延安的，只有延属分区的专员，我们就根据他的回忆，布置了毛主席故居的室内的陈设，并且把它保存在这影片里了。
    解放了的中国的愉快的图景是非常之多的，拍摄也比较容易，但是千头万绪，从那里着手？着重一些什么呢？格拉西莫夫抓住了工人和农民的劳动，中国和苏联的友谊，文化艺术和保卫和平这些重要的材料，扼要而生动地表现了新的中国的主要的动态。
    苏联的摄影师们，即使是拍摄一个极短的画面也要作细密的准备，从来不草率从事。他们对于将去拍摄的地方都在事先作了充分的调查。关于画面的明暗，角度，构图和背景，他们无不精心研究，细致推敲。他们中间有的人不爱用轻便的手提的爱姆机，宁愿使用一种笨重的摄影机，这种机子，虽说笨重，但在摄影的时候，有木脚支在地面上，不会抖动，拍出来的画面一点也不会颤动，不会发生他们常常嘲笑的画面“跳舞”的情况。
    音乐和音响，也是影片的有机的部分，必须配合得很好，要使它们和画面成为一个和谐的整体。五卅惨案那场面，音响里有帝国主义者屠杀中国示威群众的枪声，我们嫌枪声低弱，录音的聂斯捷洛夫说，五卅惨案在本片里是一种回忆，要是枪声太大了，就会使人感到它是眼前的现实的事件，必须使枪声朦朦胧胧的，这才显出它是对于遥远的过去的事情的回想。
    经过中苏两国的电影工作者一年的努力，“解放了的中国”拍制成功了。现在这部影片获得了光荣的一等斯大林奖金，这是毛主席的光荣，是他领导解放的新中国的全体人民的光荣，也是中苏两国的不可摧毁的深厚的友谊的又一鲜明的标志。在这片子的制作过程中，我出力是很微小的，附于骥尾，我也获得了崇高的奖励，在这里，除了表示个人的感激之外，并向参加这个影片的工作的全体苏联同志谨致深深的谢意和崇高的敬意。
    最后，让我们祝福斯大林和毛主席，愿他们万寿无疆。（附图片）
