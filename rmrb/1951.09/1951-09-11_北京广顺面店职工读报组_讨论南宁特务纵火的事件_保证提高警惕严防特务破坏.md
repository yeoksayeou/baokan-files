    Beijing Guangshun Noodle Shop Employees' Reading Group
    Discusses the Nanning Special Agent Arson Incident
    Guarantees to Improve Vigilance and Strictly Prevent Special Agent Sabotage

To the Editor:

    After our reading group read the letter "Leading Cadres of the Lai Zhen Duan Materials Factory of the Hengyang Railway Bureau Have Paralyzed Thinking, Special Agents Arson Causes Serious Losses" in the "Readers' Letters" column of the August 29th People's Daily, we thought it was a very serious issue and conducted a discussion.

    During the discussion, everyone's hatred for counter-revolutionary elements increased. In this Nanning special agent arson incident that caused the explosion of the ammunition depot, more than 470 houses were collapsed, more than 400 residents were killed and injured, and more than 1,700 people were affected by the disaster. What a serious loss to the people! This once again tells us that counter-revolutionary elements are the mortal enemies of the people, and they want to harm our interests all the time.

    Therefore, everyone deeply realized that: complacency can ruin major events. We must always be vigilant and wage a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionary elements; only by thoroughly eliminating complacency can we live a peaceful life. The explosion incident mentioned in the above letter was caused by the "breathing a sigh of relief" and complacent thinking of the leading cadres of the Laizhen Duan Materials Factory of the Hengyang Railway Bureau, which allowed the special agents to take advantage of the loopholes. Otherwise, this incident could have been completely avoided.

    As the letter said: "We must seriously accept this bloody lesson, improve our vigilance, and eliminate complacent thinking." All comrades in our reading group realize that: although we have suppressed many counter-revolutionary elements in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, as long as imperialism exists for one day, its conspiracies and sabotage activities will not stop. We guarantee that we will continue to improve our vigilance, resolutely assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and defend our happy life.

### 北京广顺面店职工读报组  讨论南宁特务纵火的事件  保证提高警惕严防特务破坏

    北京广顺面店职工读报组
    讨论南宁特务纵火的事件
    保证提高警惕严防特务破坏编辑同志：
    我们读报组读了八月二十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏“衡阳铁路局来镇段材料厂领导干部思想麻痹，特务纵火造成严重损失”的来信后，认为这是一个很严重的问题，就进行了一次讨论。
    在讨论中，大家更增加了对反革命分子的痛恨。在这次南宁市特务纵火引起炸药库爆炸事件中，房屋震塌四百七十余间，居民死伤四百余人，受灾人达一千七百多个，这是人民多么严重的损失！这再一次告诉我们，反革命分子是人民的死敌，它们无时无刻不想来危害我们的利益。
    因此，大家更深刻地认识了：麻痹思想会坏大事。我们必须随时提高警惕，与反革命分子作坚决的斗争；只有澈底肃清麻痹思想，我们才能过安生日子。上述来信中所说的爆炸事件，就是因为衡阳铁路局来镇段材料厂领导干部有了“松一口气”的麻痹轻敌思想，才会被特务钻了空子。否则，这个事件是完全可以避免的。
    正如来信中所说：“我们必须认真地接受这次血的教训，提高警惕性，扫除麻痹思想。”我们读报组全体同志都认识到：虽然在镇压反革命运动中我们已经镇压了很多反革命分子，但是，只要帝国主义存在一天，它的阴谋破坏活动是不会停止的。我们保证一定要继续提高警惕，坚决协助政府镇压反革命，巩固人民民主专政，保卫我们的幸福生活。
