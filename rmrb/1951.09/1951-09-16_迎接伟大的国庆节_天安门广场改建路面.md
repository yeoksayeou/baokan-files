    Welcoming the Great National Day
    Tiananmen Square Road Reconstruction
    [This newspaper dispatch] To welcome the great National Day, Tiananmen Square is undergoing its third renovation. The first opening of this square was on the eve of the founding ceremony in 1949. At that time, the main task was to remove trees and dismantle the flower beds in the middle of the road surface, and only a temporary treatment was done to the road surface. The second renovation was before the National Day last year, when the ornamental columns and stone lions were moved, a reviewing stand was built on the north side, and only a rough asphalt road was paved on the south side. During the "May 1st" this year, when the parade passed through the square, the road surface softened due to the warm weather and the large number of people, which affected the progress of the parade. The main project of the third renovation of Tiananmen Square this year is to convert the road surface to a rigid pavement.
    The construction project started on August 24th, and because time is short, it must be completed by September 20th. Therefore, more than 1,700 workers were mobilized, including 1,100 stonemasons from Wuqiao, Quyang, Yuanshi, Shunyi and other places. This project uses stone slabs, cylinder bricks, and cement bricks to pave 13,290 square meters of road surface, which is a large scale. The workers accepted this glorious task and highly demonstrated their patriotic enthusiasm. They worked diligently day and night to welcome the great National Day of the motherland. The entire project is progressing very smoothly and is expected to be completed on schedule. (Jin Xin)

    迎接伟大的国庆节
    天安门广场改建路面
    【本报讯】为了迎接伟大的国庆节，天安门广场正在进行第三次修建。第一次开辟这个广场，是一九四九年开国典礼前夕，那时主要是拔除树木和折除路面中间的花池子，对路面仅仅作了临时处理。第二次修建是去年国庆节前夕，移动华表和石狮，在北面修建观礼台，对南面的道路只铺修了一条粗糙的沥青路。今年“五一”节，游行队伍通过广场时，因天暖人多，路面软化，曾经影响了游行队伍的行进。今年天安门广场的第三次修建，主要工程是把路面改修为刚性路。
    修建工程于八月二十四日开工，因时间近促，须赶在九月二十日完工。因此动员了工人一千七百多人，其中来自吴桥、曲阳、元氏、顺义等地的石工达一千一百人。这次工程是用石板、缸砖和洋灰砖铺修一万三千二百九十平方公尺的路面，规模很大。工人们接受了这一光荣任务，高度地发挥了爱国热情，他们日夜辛勤地劳动，来迎接祖国伟大的国庆节日。整个工程进行得非常顺利，预计可按期完工。（靳新）
