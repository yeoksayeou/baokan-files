According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily of August 28th, the teachers, students, and staff of the Seventh-day Adventist China Training Institute in Qiaotouzhen, Zhenjiang, and the Seventh-day Adventist Jiangzhe Training Institute in Shanghai (note: "Training Institute" is a pseudonym for schools run by the Adventist Church) held an accusation meeting in Shanghai on August 26th. They accused American imperialism of using the Adventist Church to poison Chinese youth and exposed the consistent counter-revolutionary activities of the loyal American imperialist running dogs Lin Yao-xi, General Secretary of the China General Conference of the Adventist Church, He Bing-duan, Secretary of the Education Department of the China General Conference, and Shen Xu-cheng, manager of the Signs of the Times Press, demanding that the People's Government handle them according to the law.

The Seventh-day Adventist China General Conference has a 50-year history, and all its work is directed by the Adventist Church Global General Conference in Washington. It is one of the tools used by American imperialism to carry out aggressive activities against China. After Christian figures across the country enthusiastically launched a patriotic reform movement from September of last year, the leaders of the Adventist Church continued to spread reactionary ideas. When various Shanghai church groups enthusiastically carried out accusation movements, the Adventist Church leaders still insisted on a reactionary stance, threatening believers and preventing them from carrying out accusations. These facts aroused great dissatisfaction and anger among the broad masses of awakened patriotic and religious believers, who rose up to accuse American imperialism and its running dogs of their counter-revolutionary crimes.

At the accusation meeting on the 26th, Wu Fang-cheng, a student of the China Training Institute, and Tian Ya-ge, a teacher, and Qiu Guang-hua, a student, of the Jiangzhe Training Institute, exposed the anti-people words and deeds of He Bing-duan, a running dog of American imperialism. He Bing-duan had expressed his intention to oppose communism to the end in his sermons. He Bing-duan had slandered the People's Government's policies for providing relief to the flood victims in northern Anhui, and spread rumors that "at least half the people will starve to death after the revolution succeeds in the future." He arrogantly prevented teachers and students from organizing trade unions and student unions, threatening them with "dismissal" and "suspension." When students rose up in December 1950 to protest Austin's shameless remarks and put up patriotic slogans such as "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country," He Bing-duan and other American imperialist elements regarded it as "rebellious" behavior. He openly said at a board meeting: "It is absolutely forbidden to talk about American aggression against China in this school, and anti-American and aid-Korea activities are absolutely prohibited." Zeng Yue-lan, Yao Wen-tian, and Peng Hua-guan, students of the China Training Institute, accused Shen Xu-cheng, a running dog of American imperialism, of his crimes, saying: Before liberation, Shen Xu-cheng consistently suppressed students at the school, colluded with bandits, special agents, landlords, and local bullies, and spread anti-communist remarks in the Qiaotouzhen school. After the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, he accepted the instructions of American imperialism and colluded with Hua Xuan-lou, a counter-revolutionary special agent and pseudo-speaker of Jurong County, to organize an illegal armed "American僑護校队" (protection of school team for overseas Americans), equipped with carbines, rifles, grenades, and other weapons, plotting armed resistance, and colluding with reactionary military officers to steal people's property, military vehicles, etc. After liberation, he shielded and concealed Hua Zi-shu, a reactionary landlord, while preventing students from organizing student unions, saying that students who patriotically joined the army "were seduced by the devil." Lin Yao-xi used all kinds of malicious lies to carry out anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda to believers, inciting and provoking believers to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government; and openly opposed the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement.

In addition, according to an article titled "Accusing American Imperialism of Using the Seventh-day Adventist Church to Invade China," published in the Shanghai Liberation Daily on August 28th by Peng Xiang-sheng, chairman of the student union of the China Training Institute, the administrative and economic power of the Seventh-day Adventist China General Conference was completely controlled by American imperialist elements. In the past, most of the executive committee members of the China General Conference were American imperialist elements, and the few other Chinese were also loyal running dogs of American imperialism. Not only was the China General Conference like this, but almost every federation and every district conference was also completely controlled and manipulated by American imperialist elements. These American imperialist elements are all wolves in sheep's clothing. They wear religious cloaks to carry out espionage activities in China, collect intelligence, and spread ideological poisons. For example, Gan Sheng-dian, an American imperialist element, lived in Northeast and North China for many years. Under the guise of missionary work, he did intelligence gathering work. After he returned to the United States, the U.S. State Department transferred him to specialize in translating information related to China. Another example is Shu Ya-ge, an American imperialist element, who went to Qinghai under the pretext of preaching in the border areas of China, secretly set up a short-wave radio station, communicated with the United States and Shanghai, and engaged in espionage intelligence work; after he returned to the United States, he took off his pastor's cloak and worked for the U.S. government, specializing in drawing maps of the topography of the northwestern border of China. Another example is Jiang Sen, an American imperialist element, who has been active in western China for many years. He not only colluded with the reactionary government to smuggle a large amount of goods, but also collected information about our country. His whereabouts were very secretive. Once, he and military personnel from the American Embassy drove directly into the inland areas of western Sichuan. In addition, Miller, an American imperialist element who served as the president of the Seventh-day Adventist China General Conference and the director of the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital for a long time, colluded with reactionary government officials and often interacted with war criminals Kong Xiang-xi, Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and others. American imperialist elements and their running dogs spread reactionary ideological poisons through various works and affiliated institutions run by the Adventist Church. For example, "Signs of the Times Monthly," under the guise of evangelism, frequently spread reactionary remarks such as anti-communism, anti-Sovietism, and "the end of the world." Xu Hua, a running dog of American imperialism, when he was the editor of "Signs of the Times Monthly," even published "Atomic Bomb and the End of the World," hyping up the American imperialist atomic bomb. Bai Ren-sheng, the former president of the Seventh-day Adventist China General Conference and an American imperialist element, ordered most of the Western missionaries to withdraw to Hong Kong on the eve of Shanghai's liberation, and moved the Seventh-day Adventist China General Conference to Hong Kong, leaving behind Luo Wei, Shi Yuehan, Di Guanglian and other American imperialist elements to lurk in Shanghai to carry out reactionary activities. Bai Ren-sheng deployed most of the Western missionaries who withdrew from China in countries neighboring southeastern China. In his report to the Seventh-day Adventist Global General Conference, he openly said:
"Temporarily distribute them in these countries until the day comes when they can return to China." Luo Wei, Shi Yuehan, Di Guanglian, and other American imperialist elements who stayed in Shanghai, along with their loyal running dogs Xu Hua, Lin Yao-xi, and others, actively carried out reactionary activities. They controlled the Adventist Church, attacked the progressive forces in the church, and prevented and sabotaged the unionization of employees at the church's "Signs of the Times Monthly" office. In the summer of 1950, Luo Wei and others left Shanghai, and Xu Hua, Lin Yao-xi, and other running dogs of American imperialism still faithfully implemented the instructions of American imperialism, not only refusing to sign the reform declaration initiated by Mr. Wu Yaozong and others, but also issuing a declaration in October of last year to counter the reform declaration. In order to rule and enslave the youth of the Adventist Church, American imperialism specially established many schools. These schools were not registered with the Chinese government, did not comply with Chinese government laws and regulations, and were not even called schools, but were called so-called "Training Institutes." American imperialism used the Training Institutes to instill ideological poisons into the youth of our country, wanting students to only remember "heaven" and the United States; it was illegal for students to read progressive books, students with patriotic ideas were considered "dangerous elements," and those who organized student unions to engage in patriotic activities were bound to be expelled. Peng Xiang-sheng was expelled from the China Training Institute in this way.

    基督复临安息日会是美帝国主义的侵略工具
    临辉
    据上海解放日报八月二十八日载，基督复临安息日会镇江桥头镇中华三育研究社、上海江浙三育研究社（按三育研究社即安息日会主办的学校的假名）的师生员工等于八月二十六日在上海举行了控诉大会，控诉美帝国主义利用安息日会毒化中国青年的罪行，并揭露了美帝国主义的忠实走狗安息日会中华总会总干事林尧喜、中华总会教育部干事何秉端、时兆报馆经理沈绪成等一贯的反革命活动，要求人民政府依法处理。
    基督复临安息日会中华总会已有五十年历史，一切工作受在华盛顿的安息日会全球总会指挥，是美帝国主义对中国进行侵略活动的工具之一。全国各地基督教人士从去年九月相继热烈展开爱国革新运动后，安息日会的领导人仍在继续传播反动思想。当上海各教会团体热烈开展控诉运动时，安息日会领导人仍坚持反动立场，威胁教徒，阻止他们进行控诉。这些事实激起广大觉悟了的爱国爱教教徒的极大不满和愤怒，他们即纷纷起来控诉美帝国主义及其走狗爪牙的反革命罪行。
    在二十六日的控诉会上，中华三育研究社学生吴方城，江浙三育研究社教员田雅各、学生邱光华等揭露了美帝国主义走狗何秉端的反人民言行。何秉端在讲道中曾表示要反共到底。何秉端曾污蔑人民政府对救济皖北水灾的方针，并造谣说“将来革命成功后至少要饿死一半人”。他狂妄地阻止教师，同学组织工会和学生会，以“解聘”和“停学”来威胁。当一九五○年十二月同学们起来抗议奥斯汀无耻谰言和张贴“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的爱国标语时，何秉端等美帝国主义分子即认为是“叛逆”行为，何在董事会上公然说：“在这个学校中绝对不准讲美国侵略中国的言论，绝对禁止抗美援朝活动。”中华三育研究社学生曾悦兰、姚文田、彭华冠控诉美帝国主义走狗沈绪成的罪行说：沈绪成在解放前就一贯在校压迫同学，勾结匪特地主恶霸，在桥头镇学校内传播反共言论。解放军渡江后，他接受美帝国主义指使，曾勾结反革命特务分子句容县伪参议长华选楼组织非法武装“美侨护校队”，配备有卡宾枪、步枪、手榴弹等武器，阴谋武装反抗，并串通反动军官盗卖人民财产军用汽车等；解放后，他又包庇隐匿反动地主华子舒，一面则阻止同学组织学生会，说爱国参军的同学“是受了魔鬼的引诱”。林尧喜曾用种种恶毒的谎言向教徒进行反苏反共宣传，煽惑挑拨教徒和共产党、人民政府对立；并公然反对三自革新运动。
    此外，据中华三育研究社学生会主席彭湘生八月二十八日在上海解放日报发表的题为“控诉美帝国主义利用安息日会侵略中国的罪行”的文章揭露：安息日会中华总会的行政及经济大权完全把持在美帝国主义分子的手中，过去中华总会执行委员中大多数都是美帝国主义分子，其他极少数中国人也是美帝国主义的忠实走狗。不但中华总会如此，每一个联合会，每一个区会，也几乎完全由美帝国主义分子把持和操纵。这些美帝国主义分子都是披着羊皮的狼，他们披着宗教外衣在中国进行特务活动，收集情报，散布思想毒素。如美帝国主义分子甘盛典在我国东北华北住了多年，他借传教为名，作刺探情报的工作，在他回国之后，美国政府国务院就把他调去专管有关中国情报的翻译工作。又如美帝国主义分子舒雅各以到中国边疆传教为名，跑到青海，私设短波无线电台，与美国及上海通消息，作间谍情报工作；他在回国后，就脱去了牧师外衣，在美国政府工作，专门绘制中国西北边疆地势的地图。再如美帝国主义分子蒋森，他在华西一带活动多年，他不但勾结反动政府，大量走私，而且还收集我国情报。他的行踪非常诡秘，有一次他和美国大使馆的军事人员一起，开了汽车直入我国西康内地。此外，长期担任安息日会中华总会会长，和上海卫生疗养院院长美帝国主义分子米勒耳勾结反动政府官僚，常和战犯孔祥熙、孙科、张群等来往。美帝国主义分子及其走狗，并通过安息日会所办的各种工作及各种附属机构，散布反动思想毒素。如“时兆月报”以传教为名，经常散布反共反苏、“世界末日”等反动言论。美帝国主义走狗徐华在任“时兆月报”编辑时，竟出版了“原子弹与世界末日”，为美帝国主义的原子弹大加吹嘘。安息日会前中华总会会长、美帝国主义分子柏仁生在上海解放前夕，命令所有大部分西教士撤退香港，并把安息日会中华总会也搬到香港去，另留下罗威、史约翰、狄光廉等美帝国主义分子潜伏在上海进行反动活动。柏仁生把大部分由中国撤退的西教士布置在邻近中国东南各国内，他在向安息日会全球总会的报告中公开地说：
    “把他们暂时分布在这些国家中，等到将来可以回到中国的日子。”留在上海的罗威、史约翰、狄光廉等和他们的忠实走狗徐华、林尧喜等，则积极进行反动活动，他们控制了安息日会，打击会中的进步力量，阻止和破坏该会“时兆月报”馆的职工组织工会。一九五○年夏罗威等离开上海，美帝国主义走狗徐华、林尧喜等仍忠实地执行美帝国主义的指示，非但拒绝在吴耀宗先生等发起的革新宣言上签名，并且还在去年十月间发表了一个宣言，与革新宣言对抗。美帝国主义为了统治及奴化安息日会的青年，特地办了许多学校，这些学校不向中国政府立案，不遵守中国政府法令，也不叫学校，而叫所谓“三育研究社”。美帝国主义利用三育研究社向我国青年灌注思想毒素，要学生只记得“天国”和美国；学生读进步书籍是犯法的，有爱国思想的学生即被认为是“危险分子”，组织学生会搞爱国活动的，那一定要开除，彭湘生即是在中华三育研究社被这样开除的。
