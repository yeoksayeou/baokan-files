This year, China's production of flue-cured tobacco leaves will greatly exceed the original plan, ensuring the supply of raw materials for the national cigarette industry. Currently, tobacco farmers in the major tobacco-producing areas across the country have already harvested and marketed their early-season tobacco, and are now harvesting and curing late-season tobacco.

The main provinces and regions producing flue-cured tobacco in China are Henan and Shandong. In previous years, due to inconvenient transportation, tobacco prices fell, and farmers mostly converted tobacco fields to grow grain crops, resulting in a sharp decline in flue-cured tobacco production, and the cigarette industry generally experienced difficulties with raw materials. This situation did not change last year, and the area planted with tobacco and the output of flue-cured tobacco nationwide did not recover to pre-war levels. This year, the People's Government called for planting more industrial raw material crops, and tobacco farmers in various places responded enthusiastically, with a sudden increase in the planting area. This year, the tobacco field area in Henan Province exceeded the pre-war figure. Linqu County in Shandong Province alone planted 100,000 mu of tobacco leaves, also exceeding the pre-war level.

This year, from planting to harvesting tobacco, farmers have waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters. In the spring, Henan Province experienced drought, and 20% to 50% of the early-season tobacco seedlings cultivated by farmers died due to drought. Farmers finally exceeded this year's planned planting area by using methods such as transferring seedlings and planting more late-season tobacco. When planting tobacco, there was a lack of rain, so farmers repaired wells and carried water to plant tobacco. This year in May, anthracnose broke out in tobacco seedlings in Changge, Xiangcheng, Jiaxian, Dengxian and other areas of Henan Province. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Henan Provincial People's Government sent technicians carrying large quantities of medicines and sprayers to the countryside to universally prevent and control the disease, which stopped its spread. In Shandong Province, there were also many cases of green mold, waist rot, and leaf spot diseases in tobacco fields in July and August. As for aphid damage, it was relatively serious in some tobacco fields in Henan, Shandong and other provinces and regions. Under the leadership of the People's Government, farmers vigorously eliminated and controlled the pests, and the reduction in production was limited. The early-season tobacco in Henan Province, with the exception of a few areas where production was reduced, generally yielded 150 to 200 jin per mu, and the late-season tobacco can yield 150 jin per mu. In Shandong Province and northern Anhui, the average yield per mu of tobacco fields can reach 160 jin.

This year, the People's Governments in various tobacco-producing areas have vigorously helped farmers solve the difficulties of lacking fertilizer for planting tobacco and lacking charcoal for curing tobacco. This year, Henan Province lent 8.7 billion yuan to tobacco farmers in Xuchang Prefecture and transported more than 100,000 tons of coal to Xuchang Prefecture. Currently, state-owned tobacco companies in various tobacco-producing areas are vigorously purchasing new tobacco from farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 今年我国烤烟产量超过计划  卷烟工业原料供应有了保证

    今年我国烤烟产量超过计划
    卷烟工业原料供应有了保证
    今年我国烤烟叶的产量将大大超过原订的计划，这就保证了对全国卷烟工业的原料供应。现在全国主要产烟区烟农已将早烟烤出应市，并正在收烤晚烟。
    我国主要产烤烟的省区是河南和山东，前几年因交通不便，烟叶跌价，农民多把烟田改种了粮食作物，以致烤烟产量大减，卷烟工业普遍感到原料困难。去年这一形势并未转变过来，全国种烟的面积和烤烟的产量，都没有恢复到战前的水平。今年人民政府号召多种工业原料作物，各地烟农热烈响应，种烟面积骤然增加，河南省今年的烟田面积超过了战前的数字，山东省临朐县一县就种了十万亩烟叶，也超过了战前水平。
    今年从种烟到收烟，农民都和自然灾害作了顽强的斗争。春天河南省天旱，农民培育的早烟烟苗被旱死的达百分之二十，多的达百分之五十。农民用调济烟苗、多种晚烟的办法，终于超过了今年计划的种烟面积。种烟时缺雨，农民就修水井，担水种烟。今年五月，河南省长葛、襄城、郏县、邓县一带的烟苗发生炭疽病，河南省人民政府农林厅派技术人员携带了大批的药剂和喷雾器下乡普遍防治，才制止了炭疽病的蔓延。山东省各地烟田，在七、八月间发生青花病、腰烂病、斑病的也不少。至于蚜虫为害，在河南、山东以及其他省区的部分烟田，都比较严重，经人民政府领导农民大力除治，减产有限。河南省的早烟除少数减产外，一般每亩收一百五十斤到二百斤，晚烟每亩可收一百五十斤。山东省和皖北区的烟田，平均每亩都可收一百六十斤。
    今年，各产烟区人民政府，都曾大力帮助农民解决种烟缺肥料、烤烟缺炭的困难。河南省今年贷给许昌专区烟农的贷款即达八十七亿元，运往许昌专区的煤炭达十万多吨。现在，各产烟区国营烟草公司都在大力收购农民的新烟。（新华社）
