Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 31st – The following is the full text of the protest letter from General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation, to Joye:

To: Vice Admiral Joye, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

At 6:00 AM on August 30th, our military police personnel Zheng Zhongnan, Yang Xianzhe, and Zhang Renfeng were resting in Tantongli within the Kaesong Neutral Zone when they were attacked by more than ten members of the South Korean forces in your side's uniforms and were taken towards your side's position. While proceeding to a small hill near the Kaesong-Munsan railway, your South Korean forces opened fire, murdering Yang Xianzhe and Zhang Renfeng. Zheng Zhongnan was injured and escaped. When our military police pursued your South Korean forces, another group of armed personnel from your side who had invaded the Kaesong Neutral Zone provided machine gun cover for the South Korean forces, who retreated southeast along the railway. Your armed personnel did not withdraw from the Neutral Zone to your side's position until 2:30 PM.

Following the serious incident on August 19th in which your armed personnel murdered our military police, your side has, on the one hand, distorted the facts and tampered with the liaison officer's investigation results, attempting to portray the South Korean forces in military uniforms as non-regular personnel unrelated to your side in order to shirk your undeniable serious responsibility. On the other hand, your armed personnel have continued to unscrupulously engage in provocative acts. Incidents of your armed personnel firing into the Neutral Zone and invading the Neutral Zone have been increasing daily. Even at 6:10 AM on August 30th, your armed personnel fired into Panmunjom within the Neutral Zone. And on August 30th, your armed personnel once again murdered our military police personnel. These incessant and intolerable provocative actions once again demonstrate your side's determination to violate the agreement and continue to create incidents. Regarding the serious incident on August 30th in which your armed personnel illegally invaded the Neutral Zone, murdered our military police personnel Yang Xianzhe and Zhang Renfeng, and wounded Zheng Zhongnan, as well as the provocative actions of your armed personnel constantly firing into the Neutral Zone, I lodge the most serious protest to you and firmly demand that you severely punish the murderers and thoroughly guarantee that your side will not engage in any further violations of the agreement.

    美方再次侵入中立区杀害我方军事警察
    南日将军向乔埃提出最严重抗议
    坚决要美方严惩凶手保证不再破坏中立区协议
   【新华社开城三十一日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军给乔埃的抗议书，全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃海军中将：
    八月三十日上午六时，我方军事警察人员郑重男、杨显泽、张仁凤在开城中立区以内炭洞里地方正在休息中，时为你方身着军服的南朝鲜部队十余人所袭击，并被押向你方阵地。行至开城、汶山间铁路附近小山上时，你方南朝鲜部队开枪射击，谋杀了杨显泽与张仁凤，郑重男负伤逃脱。当我方军事警察向你方南朝鲜部队追击时，你方侵入开城中立区内的另一部分武装人员，更以机枪掩护南朝鲜部队沿铁路向东南方向撤退。直至下午二时三十分，你方武装人员才从中立区撤向你方阵地。
    在八月十九日你方武装人员谋害我方军事警察的严重事件之后，你方一方面歪曲事实，篡改联络官调查结果，企图将穿着军服的南朝鲜部队，说成是与你方无任何关系的非正规人员，以推卸你方无可推卸的严重责任。另一方面，你方武装人员依然继续肆无忌惮地不断进行挑衅的行为。你方武装人员向中立区内射击，以及侵入中立区以内的事件竟日益增加。即在八月三十日上午六时十分，你方武装人员还向中立区以内板门店射击。而你方武装人员在八月三十日竟再一次谋害我方军事警察人员。这种毫无休止，不可容忍的挑衅行动，再次证明你方破坏协议，继续制造事件的决心。对于八月三十日你方武装人员非法侵入中立区，谋害我方军事警察人员杨显泽、张仁凤，枪伤郑重男的严重事件，以及你方武装人员不断向中立区以内射击的挑衅行为，我向你提出最严重的抗议，并坚决要求你严格惩办凶手，并彻底保证你方不再发生破坏协议的任何事件。
    朝鲜人民军中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军
    一九五一年八月三十一日
