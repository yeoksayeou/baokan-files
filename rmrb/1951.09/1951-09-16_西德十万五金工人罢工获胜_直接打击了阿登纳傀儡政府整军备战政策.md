Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th dispatch: The strike of 105,000 metalworkers in Hesse, West Germany, demanding wage increases, which had bravely persisted for half a month, ended provisionally on the 13th with partial victory. The capitalists of 90 factories have agreed to the demand of 15,000 workers in those factories for a wage increase of 12 pfennigs per hour. The "Industrialists Association," which had originally refused wage increases, has reopened negotiations with the remaining workers to discuss wage increase issues.

This strike swept through metal factories in major industrial cities of Hesse. Since the strike began on August 27, the number of participants has increased from 35,000 to over 100,000. This strike directly hit the Adenauer government's rearmament policy. A strike leader in Frankfurt said: "We have long recognized that our demand for higher wages is inextricably linked to the issue of re-militarization and the Adenauer government's anti-people policy."

During the strike, the United States and the Bonn authorities, along with capitalists and right-wing trade unions, jointly attempted to split the strike movement on several occasions, but they all failed. In Kassel, American officers attempted to conclude a special contract with 400 workers at the "Henschel Locomotive Factory" to repair American military vehicles, but this was rejected by the central strike committee. In Hanover, capitalists and right-wing trade unions also attempted to weaken the strike front by concluding special contracts with workers in individual factories, but they were unsuccessful.

### 西德十万五金工人罢工获胜  直接打击了阿登纳傀儡政府整军备战政策

    西德十万五金工人罢工获胜
    直接打击了阿登纳傀儡政府整军备战政策
    【新华社十五日讯】柏林消息：西德黑森州十万五金工人要求增加工资的大罢工在英勇坚持半个月以后，已于十三日取得部分胜利而暂告结束。九十个工厂的资方已经同意了各该厂所属一万五千名工人所提每小时增加工资十二芬尼的要求；原来拒绝增加工资的“工业家联合会”已经与其余的工人重开谈判讨论增加工资的问题。
    这次罢工席卷了黑森州各主要工业城市的五金工厂。从八月二十七日罢工开始以后，参加罢工的人数自三万五千人增加到十万人以上。这次罢工直接打击了阿登纳政府的整军备战政策。法兰克福的一个罢工领袖说：“我们早已认识到我们提高工资的要求与重新军国主义化问题和阿登纳政府的反人民政策有着不可分割的联系。”
    在罢工期间，美国和波恩当局与资方及右翼工会曾联合起来屡次企图分裂罢工运动，但是都遭受到了失败。在卡塞尔，美国军官曾企图与“汉金尔机车工厂”的四百名工人缔结一个修理美国军车的特别合同，但是，遭到了罢工中央委员会的拒绝。在哈诺，资方与右翼工会也曾企图通过与个别工厂工人缔结特别合同的办法来削弱罢工阵线，但是都未成功。
