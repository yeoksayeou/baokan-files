    In the Land Reform Movement
    Communist Party Members Must Firmly Support the Peasants
    Xuan Rong, Deputy Director of the South China Regional Committee of the Seamen's Union, Punished for Losing Class Standpoint
    Xuan Rong (Note: Xuan pronounced Xuan), Deputy Director of the South China Regional Committee of the Seamen's Union and a Communist Party member, lost his class standpoint and attacked the peasant movement during land reform. This lesson should serve as a warning to all Party cadres in land reform areas.

    Xuan Rong was from Xuan Village, District 3, Enping County, Guangdong, and came from a seamen worker background. He joined the Party during the Great Revolution and had been away from his hometown for over a decade. This time, upon returning to Enping, he was surrounded by landlords. He took a letter written for him by a landlord to County Head Zheng Dingnuo, claiming that cadres were deviating in the execution of policies, and that he had returned to his hometown this time to "do something for the masses." Zheng Dingnuo reminded him at the time to be careful not to be exploited by feudal forces, but he ignored this advice.

    After returning to his village, Xuan Rong convened a so-called "Workers and Peasants Mass Meeting" in Sheng Tang Market, and notified County Head Zheng Dingnuo and all district and township cadres of the Third District, who were then attending a district and township cadres meeting at the district government, to attend and "listen to the opinions of the masses." Zheng Dingnuo did not go, and only District Head Gu Jiang and a cadre surnamed Liang attended from the district and township cadres. At the meeting, District Head Gu Jiang realized that this "Workers and Peasants Mass Meeting" was jointly attended by merchants and peasants from Sheng Tang Market. He immediately expressed his opinion, explaining that most of the merchants in Sheng Tang Market were also landlords and rich peasants, and it was inappropriate to have them meet together with the peasants. Therefore, a "Merchants' Meeting" was held first. This meeting ended after speeches by Xuan Rong, Gu Jiang, and a trade union representative who was present. This was followed by the "Peasants' Meeting".

    Although the merchants of Sheng Tang Market did not attend this "Peasants' Meeting," it was in fact arranged and controlled by landlords. For example, Cen Yong, a landlord who also engaged in commerce, sent someone to ride a bicycle to Shi Tang Village, twenty miles away from Sheng Tang Market, to summon his henchmen to attend the meeting. Many landlords from far away from Sheng Tang Market also gathered in Sheng Tang Market early in the morning and made secret arrangements. Therefore, after Xuan Rong spoke, landlords, local bullies, and their relatives and henchmen who had been struggled against by the peasants began to "complain" in a planned way. For example, landlord henchman Feng Lin "accused" the head of the Panji Village Peasants' Association of "holding two positions and receiving double pay, with four people using seven guns." The peasants who attended the meeting, unprepared and seeing that the meeting was disorganized, left one after another. In the end, only one hundred and several dozen landlords, local bullies, and their relatives and henchmen were left shouting there. The next day, Xuan Rong took these voices of the landlords as "mass opinions" and returned to Guangzhou.

    As a result, the landlord class regained its power and嚣张 (qiāozhāng) in front of the peasants, shouting loudly: "Xuan Rong is also supporting us!" Xu Jiesheng, a local bully from Puwu Village, Xiliang Township, who had previously dominated the public hall, seized people's land, and acted tyrannically, had already bowed his head and agreed to compensate forty dan of grain when he was liquidated by the peasants last year. At this time, he stubbornly stated: "The grain cannot be handed over. Kill me if you want to kill me, arrest me if you want to arrest me!" The landlords in Dajiang Township were even more arrogant, even wanting to "publicly try" the township government staff, plotting to overthrow the township government. They also spread rumors: "The district is going to arrest the heads of the Peasants' Associations!" "The district is going to hold dismissal meetings!" "Landlords are going to become officials!" The emotions of the village cadres fluctuated, and the peasants who had actively opposed the local bullies in the past also felt deeply uneasy due to fear of the landlords' counterattack.

    In this situation, the district leadership held a district and township cadres meeting on February 16. County Head Zheng Dingnuo personally attended and offered assurances: "The People's Government will definitely support the peasants!" The local bully Xu Jiesheng, who stubbornly resisted compensating the peasants for their losses, was detained, and the landlords who were in arrears of public grain were ordered to hand over the public grain within a time limit. At the same time, it was decided to rectify the grass-roots organizations in conjunction with the struggle against local bullies, which initially stabilized the emotions of the peasants and cadres.

    After the CCP Guangdong Central Local Committee and the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau learned of Xuan Rong's erroneous behavior in losing his standpoint, they made serious criticisms of Xuan Rong and gave him the disciplinary action he deserved. Xuan Rong also made a self-criticism.

    在土地改革的运动中
    共产党员要坚定地支持农民   
    海员工会华南区委员会副主任禤荣丧失阶级立场受到处分
    海员工会华南区委员会副主任、共产党员禤荣（按：禤音喧）在土地改革中丧失了阶级立场，打击了农民运动，这个教训值得所有在土地改革地区的党员干部警惕。
    禤荣是广东恩平县三区区村乡禤村人，海员工人出身，大革命时代参加了党，离乡已十多年。这次回到恩平，受了地主包围，他拿着地主给他写的信去见县长郑鼎诺，说干部执行政策有偏差，所以他这次回乡要“为群众做点事”。当时郑鼎诺即曾提醒他，要注意勿为封建势力利用，但他不理不睬。
    禤荣回到乡间后，在圣堂墟召开所谓“工农群众大会”，并通知县长郑鼎诺和当时正在区政府开区乡干部会议的第三区全体区乡干部去参加，“听取群众意见”。郑鼎诺未去，区乡干部也只有区长顾江和一个姓梁的干部去参加。开会时，区长顾江发觉了这个“工农群众大会”是圣堂墟的商人和农民一齐开的，当即表示意见，说明圣堂墟的商人，大部分兼地主、富农，让他们和农民一齐开会是不妥当的。因此先开了“商人大会”。这个大会在禤荣、顾江和列席大会的工会代表相继讲话后就结束了。接着就开“农民大会”。
    圣堂墟的商人虽然没有参加这个“农民大会”，但这个大会实际上是由地主布置并控制掌握的。如兼营商业的地主岑永，即叫人骑自行车到离圣堂墟二十里的石塘村叫他的爪牙来开会。许多离圣堂墟很远的地主，也一早就到圣堂墟集中，作了秘密布置。因此在禤荣讲话后，被农民斗争过的地主、恶霸以及他们的亲属、爪牙，就有计划地在会上“诉”起“苦”来。例如地主爪牙冯麟就“控告”了盘记村农会长“一身兼两职双薪，四个人用七条枪”。到会的农民因为事前无准备，又见这个会开得不成样子，一个接一个地走了。最后只剩下一百几十个地主恶霸和他们的亲属爪牙在那里叫嚣。次日，禤荣就带着这些地主之音作为“群众意见”回广州去了。
    这一来，地主阶级又威风起来了，在农民面前大肆叫嚣：“禤荣也撑我们的腰！”西良乡朴屋村恶霸徐捷盛，过去霸管公堂，夺人田产，横行霸道，去年被农民清算时，已低头答允赔偿四十担谷。这时却横蛮地表示：“谷是没有得交了，要杀就杀，要捉就捉吧！”大江乡的地主则更为嚣张，竟要“公审”乡政府工作人员，阴谋推翻乡政权。并放出谣言：“区上要捉农会长了！”“区上要开撤职会议了！”“地主要做官了！”乡村干部的情绪波动起来了，过去积极反对恶霸的农民，也因害怕地主反攻而深感不安。
    在这种情况下，区的领导机关于二月十六日召开了区乡干部会议，县长郑鼎诺亲自参加，并提出保证：“人民政府一定撑农民的腰！”当将顽抗赔偿农民损失的恶霸徐捷盛扣押起来，并令拖欠公粮的地主限期交清公粮，同时决定结合反恶霸斗争整顿基层组织，初步安定了农民和干部的情绪。
    当中共粤中地方委员会和中共中央华南分局获悉禤荣丧失立场的错误行为后，即对禤荣提出严正批评，并给予应得的纪律处分。禤荣也作了自我检讨。
