Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: According to TASS, the proposal by Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, and the resolution of the People's Chamber to convene an all-German conference to hold all-German elections and accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany have aroused great repercussions in public opinion in Western European countries.

Progressive public opinion in France, Britain, and other countries warmly supports Grotewohl's statement. The French newspaper *l'Humanité* said: Grotewohl's proposal is a proposal for the peaceful resolution of the German question. It opposes the plan decided by the Washington meeting of the three foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France to restore the fascist defense forces and conclude a separate peace with German revanchists, and seeks to avoid war and unify Germany. The United States suggests that Germany continue Hitler's policies, while Grotewohl suggests fighting for peace within the scope of a unified Germany. Therefore, Grotewohl's proposal immediately received the most enthusiastic response from the broad masses of people in West Germany. *Ce Soir* pointed out that the unreasonable and hostile policy of the Bonn "government" in West Germany in adhering to its rejection of Grotewohl's proposal will inevitably expose its intention to maintain the division of Germany and help turn West Germany into a dangerous base for a world war in the eyes of the West German people.

The British *Daily Worker* published an editorial pointing out that Grotewohl's proposal is the only way to peace, while the Washington Conference's decision to arm German revanchists is to plunge the whole world into war. The newspaper called on the British people to take immediate action to fight against the Washington Conference decision, which is the sacred responsibility that every British patriot must bear for the nation.

The French bourgeois newspapers cannot obliterate the great significance of Grotewohl's proposal. All newspapers in Paris had to unanimously publish the news of Grotewohl's statement and the People's Chamber resolution on September 17. Although British bourgeois public opinion tried to minimize the significance of Grotewohl's proposal, it could not conceal its fear and unease that the Washington Conference's plan to arm West Germany would be severely hit by Grotewohl's proposal. The Bonn correspondent of *The Observer* said in commenting on Grotewohl's statement: The content of this proposal is more practical than previous ones. *The Manchester Guardian* said with concern: Adenauer should not simply reject this proposal immediately, this proposal is worth exploring.

    格罗提渥建议和平解决德国问题
    法英进步舆论表示热烈拥护
    资产阶级报纸也无法掩饰其恐惧和不安
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社消息：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥声明及人民议会决议所提出的召开全德会议以举行全德选举并加速缔结对德和约的建议，在西欧各国舆论中引起极大的反响。
    法、英等国进步舆论热烈拥护格罗提渥的声明。法国《人道报》说：格罗提渥的建议是和平解决德国问题的建议。它反对华盛顿美英法三外长会议所决定的恢复法西斯国防军、与德国报复分子单独媾和的计划，而要避免战争，统一德国。美国建议德国继续希特勒的政策，而格罗提渥却建议在统一的德国的范围内为和平而斗争。因此格罗提渥的建议立刻在西德广大人民中获得最热烈的响应。《今晚报》指出：西德波恩“政府”坚持其拒绝格罗提渥建议的无理的敌对政策，就必然要在西德人民面前暴露它意图维持德国分裂状态、并帮助把西德变成世界战争的危险基地的面目。
    英国《工人日报》发表社论指出：格罗提渥建议是走向和平的唯一途径，而华盛顿会议武装德国复仇主义者的决议是要把全世界抛入战争。该报号召英国人民立刻行动起来，为反对华盛顿会议决议而斗争是每一个英国爱国者为了民族所必须负起的神圣责任。
    法国资产阶级报纸无法抹煞格罗提渥建议的重大意义，巴黎各报在九月十七日都不得不一致刊登了格罗提渥声明和人民议会决议的消息。英国资产阶级舆论虽然力图缩小格罗提渥建议的意义，但是却掩饰不了它们因为华盛顿会议武装西德计划将受到格罗提渥建议的严重打击而感到的恐惧和不安。《观察家》报驻波恩记者在评论格罗提渥声明时说：这次建议的内容要比以前几次提出的都更为实际。《曼彻斯特卫报》忧虑地说：阿登纳不应简单地立即拒绝这个建议就了事，这个建议是值得探讨的。
