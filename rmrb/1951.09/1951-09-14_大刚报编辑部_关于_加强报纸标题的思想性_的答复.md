    Reply Regarding "Strengthening the Ideological Nature of Newspaper Headlines"

    To the Editors:
    The criticism made by Comrade Sun Xingran in the People's Daily on August 7th regarding the headline of our newspaper's June 22nd editorial (namely, "The Death of the Chinese People is the Pleasure of the Imperialist Elements!") is correct. The main idea of that editorial was to point out the planned conspiracy of the imperialist elements to murder the Chinese people, so as to arouse the hatred of the broad masses of the people against the imperialist elements; however, the headline of the editorial did not completely express this main idea, and therefore it appeared one-sided and lacked ideological nature. We sincerely accept Comrade Sun Xingran's criticism and are conducting education within the editorial department to strengthen the ideological nature of the newspaper. In the future, whether it is a news item or an article, we will strive to ensure that the headline can express a complete ideological nature.

### 大刚报编辑部  关于“加强报纸标题的思想性”的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    大刚报编辑部
    关于“加强报纸标题的思想性”的答复编辑同志：
    八月七日人民日报发表的孙星燃同志对我报六月二十二日一篇社论标题（即“中国人民的死亡是帝国主义分子的愉快！”）的批评，是正确的。本来那篇社论的主题思想，是要指出帝国主义分子有计划的阴谋杀害中国人民，借以激起广大人民对帝国主义分子的仇恨；但社论的标题却没有把这个主题思想完整地表现出来，因此就显得片面，缺乏思想性。我们诚恳地接受孙星燃同志的批评，并且正在编辑部进行加强报纸思想性的教育。以后无论是新闻或文章的标题，一定力求能表现出完整的思想性。
