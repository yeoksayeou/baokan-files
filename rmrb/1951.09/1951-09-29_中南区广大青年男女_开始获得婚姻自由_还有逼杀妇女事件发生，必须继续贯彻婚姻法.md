The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China has brought happiness to the broad masses of young men and women in the Central-South Region. They marry independently and live happy lives. According to incomplete statistics, from January to April this year, more than 23,600 young men and women in the region registered for marriage with local people's governments. After the publicity of the Marriage Law in Yongning County, Guangxi, in the second district alone, 23 young men and women married independently from March to June this year. According to statistics from 34 townships in Zhengzhou Special District, Henan Province, 469 widows remarried independently in half a year. Chen Guiying, a widow in Wuning County, Jiangxi Province, who had been widowed for twelve years, said after her marriage: "Chairman Mao saved me. I must produce well to repay Chairman Mao." A woman in Jigong Temple, Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, who had been widowed for more than ten years, had never produced well, but on the second day of her marriage, she went to work in the fields with her husband. After understanding the benefits of the Marriage Law, many elderly people no longer interfere with their children's marriages. Some mothers-in-law and husbands who often abused women have also changed their attitudes after being educated by the Marriage Law and dare not abuse women anymore. Some criminals who abused and killed women have been punished by law.

The promulgation of the Marriage Law has enabled women who have suffered from feudal marriage systems to dare to rise up and fight against unreasonable marriage systems. According to incomplete statistics from the Judicial Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, from January to May this year, judicial departments at all levels in the region accepted a total of 32,881 marriage cases, accounting for more than 60% of all civil cases in the region. Among these marriage cases, divorce cases reached 25,972, most of which were filed by women who were most severely oppressed by unreasonable marriage systems. In the marriage cases accepted by the People's Court of Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, in ten months, 84.3% of the divorce cases were filed by women. In Hubei Province, a 28-year-old "waiting-for-husband bride" took her eight-year-old husband to the court and divorced. Some young men and women found satisfactory partners after divorce, and their enthusiasm for production increased accordingly. Yuan, from Canghai Township, Youfang District, Wuchang County, Hubei Province, was often abused by her husband and had no intention of producing. After divorcing and marrying independently, she actively produced and became a production model. Liu He and his wife in Pohu Township, Changge County, Henan Province, had disagreements and divorced. Both found suitable partners, and both families were very enthusiastic about production.

However, in many areas, especially in rural areas, due to the strong influence of feudal ideology and customs, the phenomena of buying and selling, arranged marriages, early marriages, adopting child brides, drowning infants, bride kidnapping, and interfering with the freedom of widows to marry still exist seriously, and even incidents of forcing and abusing women to death occur. According to incomplete statistics, in eight counties of Changsha Special District, Hunan Province, from May to August last year, 99 women were forced to death due to marriage problems; in Huaiyang Special District, Henan Province, 212 women were abused to death in less than a year; in Shangqiu Special District, Henan Province, more than 30 women committed suicide due to marriage problems from January to April this year; in Huang'an County, Hubei Province, 14 women were forced to death in July and August last year. The occurrence of these unfortunate events is mainly because some local people's governments do not pay enough attention to the Marriage Law. They have not seriously carried out publicity and education on the Marriage Law among cadres and the masses, and have not dealt with many incidents of infringing on women's freedom of marriage in a timely and reasonable manner. Some local cadres (especially district and village cadres) even openly resisted the Marriage Law and directly interfered with women's freedom of marriage. In response to the above situation, the Central-South Military and Political Committee issued an order on August 24 regarding the implementation of the Marriage Law. The order requires people's governments at all levels to universally and deeply carry out publicity and education on the implementation of the Marriage Law, and to regard the implementation of the Marriage Law as one of the important daily tasks. Those who violate the Marriage Law and cause persecution, abuse, and other criminal acts must be severely punished according to law. In addition, the Civil Affairs Department and the Judicial Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee have also recently issued circulars on the implementation of the Marriage Law, criticizing some cadres' various erroneous views on the Marriage Law and the deviations in handling mass marriage cases. The Preparatory Committee of the Central-South Democratic Women's Federation has recently printed more than 48,000 copies of publicity materials on marriage issues, and sent cadres to the families of workers in Daye, Hubei to deeply understand marriage issues and conduct publicity on the Marriage Law at the same time.

    中南区广大青年男女
    开始获得婚姻自由
    还有逼杀妇女事件发生，必须继续贯彻婚姻法
    中华人民共和国婚姻法给中南区广大青年男女带来了幸福。他们自主结婚，过着愉快生活。据不完全统计，全区在今年一月至四月，就有二万三千六百多对青年男女到各地人民政府办理结婚登记。广西邕宁县经过婚姻法的宣传后，仅第二区在今年三月至六月就有二十三对青年男女自主结婚。河南省郑州专区三十四个乡的统计，在半年中就有四百六十九个寡妇自主结婚。江西武宁县守了十二年寡的陈桂英结婚后说：“毛主席救了我，我一定好好生产，报答毛主席。”河南省郑州市鸡公寺一个守了十来年寡的妇女，一向不好好生产，在结婚的第二天就和丈夫一道到地里去干活。许多老年人在懂得婚姻法的好处后，都不再干涉儿女的婚事了。有些经常虐待妇女的婆婆和丈夫，在经过婚姻法的教育后，也改变了态度，不敢再虐待妇女了。有些虐待和杀害妇女的凶犯，已受到了法律的制裁。
    婚姻法的公布，使遭受封建婚姻制度迫害的妇女敢于起来向不合理的婚姻制度作斗争。据中南军政委员会司法部的不完全统计，自今年一月至五月，全区各级司法部门共受理婚姻案件三万二千八百八十一件，占全区民事案件的百分之六十以上。在这些婚姻案件中，离婚案件达二万五千九百七十二件，其中绝大多数是受不合理的婚姻制度压迫最重的妇女提出来的。江西省南昌市人民法院在十个月中受理的婚姻案件，由女方提出离婚的占百分之八十四点三。湖北省曾有一个二十八岁的“望郎媳”带着八岁的丈夫到法院去离了婚。有些青年男女离婚后找到了满意的对象，生产情绪就随着提高了。湖北省武昌县油房区沧海乡袁氏，经常受丈夫虐待，无心生产，离婚后自主结了婚，积极生产，当了生产模范。河南省长葛县坡胡乡刘合与妻子感情不合，离婚后双方都找到了合适的对象，两家生产情绪都很高。
    但在许多地区，特别是在农村中，由于封建思想和习俗的强烈影响，仍然严重地存在着买卖、包办、早婚、收童养媳、溺婴、抢婚、干涉寡妇婚姻自由等现象，甚至发生逼杀、虐杀妇女的事件。据不完全统计，湖南省长沙专区八个县，在去年五月至八月，就有九十九个妇女因婚姻问题被迫致死；河南省淮阳专区不到一年中，被虐杀的妇女达二百十二人；河南省商邱专区今年一月至四月有三十多个妇女因婚姻问题自杀；湖北省黄安县去年七、八两个月就有十四个妇女被迫致死。这些不幸事件的发生，主要是由于某些地方人民政府对婚姻法还不够重视，他们没有在干部和群众中认真地进行婚姻法的宣传教育，对当地发生的许多侵犯妇女婚姻自由的事件没有及时地、合理地加以处理，有些地方干部（特别是区、村干部）甚至公开抵抗婚姻法，直接干涉妇女婚姻自由。针对上述情况，中南军政委员会在八月二十四日发布了关于贯彻婚姻法的命令。命令要求各级人民政府普遍深入地进行贯彻实施婚姻法的宣传教育工作，并把贯彻执行婚姻法作为日常重要工作之一。对有违抗婚姻法以致造成迫害、虐杀等犯罪行为者必须依法严加惩处。此外，中南军政委员会民政部和司法部也在最近发出了贯彻执行婚姻法的通报，批判了某些干部对婚姻法的各种错误看法以及在处理群众婚姻案件中的偏差。中南民主妇女联合会筹备委员会在最近印发了四万八千多份婚姻问题宣传资料，并派干部到湖北大冶的职工家属中去深入了解婚姻问题，同时进行婚姻法的宣传。（新华社）
