To the Editors:

The people's film industry is developing. Many films, in order to depict the great Liberation War and the lives of workers and peasants, require the assistance of troops, workers, and peasants in their production. I believe that as long as films are educational for the people, they should be given full assistance. However, it has now been discovered that some films distort real life and have no educational significance for the people, and yet troops, workers, and peasants participate in the performances. The recently released "March of the Married Couple" in Beijing is one example. Therefore, I suggest that in the future, units assisting in performances should pay attention to the content of the films, and if the content is not good, they should not participate in the performance.

    协助演出的单位应注意影片的内容编辑同志：
    人民电影事业正在发展，有许多影片中为了描写伟大的解放战争，及工人、农民的生活，在摄制中需要部队、工人、农民的协助演出。我认为只要是对人民有教育意义的影片，是应该给以全力协助的。可是现在发现一些影片是歪曲现实生活、对人民没有教育意义的，也有部队、工人、农民参加演出。如最近在北京上映过的“夫妇进行曲”就是一例。所以我建议今后协助演出的单位，应注意影片的内容，如内容不好，就不应该参加演出。
