    Insults to Ethnic Minority Compatriots Are Not Allowed
    —A Critique of a Comic Book
    I have seen the comic book "The 25,000 Li Long March" (tenth edition, March 1951) printed by the East China Bookstore in Shanghai. Although the words "Revised Edition" are printed on the cover, I believe it still has some serious shortcomings:
    Page 49 of the book narrates that the Red Army entered the large grasslands on the border of Sichuan, Xikang, and Qinghai. It depicts several ethnic minority compatriots holding knives and guns, pointing at a Red Army soldier on a mountain top. The explanatory text reads: "It often rains, making it difficult to walk, and there are also barbarians attacking." Another page depicts two ethnic minority compatriots leading the Red Army, with the text: "Later, several barbarians acted as guides, and they finally left the grasslands." Calling ethnic minorities "barbarians" and referring to ethnic minority areas as "barbarian places" is a discriminatory and insulting term used by the Kuomintang reactionary government's Han chauvinists. Today, when all ethnic groups are equal, mutually helpful, and united in friendship, it is necessary to review and correct the error of printing such erroneous terms in books and spreading them widely.
    The book also contains some other errors, such as the distorted depiction on page 51 of Red Army soldiers casually pulling up the masses' radishes to eat in the fields. Also, on page 58, an enemy soldier being pursued by the Red Army has a red star painted on his hat, blurring the distinction between friend and foe.
    In general, the author lacks understanding of this glorious and great army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Long March. The author treats the revolutionary deeds as mere anecdotes, neglecting the revolutionary tasks of the Red Army during the Long March and its relationship with ethnic minorities. I believe that the author should strictly examine and correct this comic book, which distorts the revolutionary deeds of the Red Army and insults and discriminates against ethnic minorities.

### 不容许侮辱少数民族同胞——对一本连环画的批评

    不容许侮辱少数民族同胞
    ——对一本连环画的批评
    我看到了上海华东书店印行的一本连环画“二万五千里长征”（一九五一年三月第十版）。虽则封面上已经印有“修正本”字样，但是我认为它还有一些严重缺点：
    该书第四十九页叙述红军走进了四川西康青海边境的大草原，画了几个少数民族同胞手里拿着刀枪指划着一个山头上的红军，说明文字为：“天又常常下雨，这样难走的地方，还有蛮人来袭击”。另外一页上画的两个少数民族同胞给红军带路，写的是“后来有几个蛮人做向导，才走出大草原”。把少数民族称为“蛮人”，把少数民族地区称为“蛮人地方”，是国民党反动政府大汉族主义者歧视和侮辱少数民族的称呼，在各民族已经平等互助团结友爱的今天，还把这种错误的称呼印在书上广为传播是应该检讨和纠正的。
    该书在另一方面也有些错误的地方，如第五十一页上歪曲地描写了红军随便在地里拔群众的萝卜吃。又第五十八页上一个被红军追击的敌兵帽子上画了一颗红星，弄得敌我不分。
    总的说来，作者对于中国共产党领导下的这支光荣伟大的军队和伟大的长征，是缺乏认识的。作者只将革命的事迹当成一般的奇闻轶事来处理，而忽视了红军在长征中的革命任务，及与少数民族的相互关系。我认为作者对这本歪曲红军的革命事迹、侮辱歧视少数民族的连环画，应加以严格检讨与纠正。  武少芳
