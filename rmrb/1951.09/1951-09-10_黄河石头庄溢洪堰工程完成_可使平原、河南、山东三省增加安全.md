    Huanghe (Yellow River) Shitou Zhuang Diversion Weir Project Completed
    Increased Safety for the Provinces of Pingyuan, Henan and Shandong
    The Shitou Zhuang diversion weir, which controls excessive flows of the Huanghe (Yellow River), was completed in August. Shitou Zhuang is located in Changyuan County, Pingyuan Province. After the diversion weir is completed, even if an abnormal flood of 23,000 cubic meters per second occurs in the Huanghe (Yellow River), it can ensure the safety of the banks along the Huanghe (Yellow River) and reinforce the Jin embankment, reduce disasters, and ensure the smooth progress of New China's economic construction.
    The fundamental elimination of the Huanghe (Yellow River)'s water disasters must wait until the completion of water storage reservoirs and other fundamental projects in the upper reaches of the Huanghe (Yellow River). Before this, if an abnormal flood occurs in the Huanghe (Yellow River), such as the 23,000 cubic meters per second flood in 1933 and the 29,000 cubic meters per second flood in 1942, the existing dikes cannot defend against them. To this end, the Central People's Government approved this spring the Huanghe (Yellow River) Water Conservancy Commission's plan to build a diversion weir in Shitou Zhuang, Changyuan County, Pingyuan Province, to control abnormal floods in the Huanghe (Yellow River). The diversion weir is 1,500 meters long, and the front of the weir has a control dike closely connected to the main dike. If the flood flow exceeds the capacity and drainage efficiency of the river channel, the control dike, which blocks general floods, can be actively opened to divert 5,000 to 6,000 cubic meters per second of flow between the banks along the Huanghe (Yellow River) and the Jin embankment, to reduce the burden on the river channel and dikes and ensure safety.
    This arduous project began in May and was fully completed by August 20, using a total of approximately 1.5 million man-days. More than 2,500 cadres at all levels participated in the project's leadership work, and a total of more than 45,000 technicians and laborers participated. The completion of this project will not only increase the safety of the three provinces of Pingyuan, Henan, and Shandong in the lower reaches of the Huanghe (Yellow River), but also reduce the threat of floodwaters to the vast farmlands in northern Jiangsu and Hebei.
    To celebrate the completion of this great project, the Pingyuan Provincial Huanghe (Yellow River) Flood Control Headquarters held celebration ceremonies and commendation meetings at the construction site on August 22 and 23. More than 20,000 workers, laborers, and cadres participated in the conference, and more than 2,000 of them were selected as models and honorably received awards from Liu Zhongrui, Director of the Central Ministry of Water Conservancy, at the conference.

    黄河石头庄溢洪堰工程完成
    可使平原、河南、山东三省增加安全
    控制黄河过大流量的石头庄溢洪堰，已于八月修成。石头庄在平原省长垣县，溢洪堰修成后，黄河即使发生二万三千秒公方的异常洪水时，也能确保临黄堤，固守金堤，减少灾害，保证新中国的经济建设顺利推进。
    根本消除黄河的水患，须待黄河上游的蓄水库等治本工程完成以后。在此以前，黄河如果发生异常洪水，如一九三三年的二万三千秒公方流量的洪水和一九四二年的二万九千秒公方流量的洪水时，就不是现在的堤防所能防御的。为此，中央人民政府今春批准了黄河水利委员会在平原省长垣县石头庄修建溢洪堰以控制黄河异常洪水的方案。溢洪堰长 一千五百公尺，堰的前沿有一条紧联大堤的控制堤。如遇洪水流量超过河槽的容受量和排泄效能，即可主动将挡一般洪水的控制堤开放，分出五千到六千秒公方的流量于临黄堤和金堤之间，以减轻河道和堤防的负担，保障安全。
    这一艰巨的工程于五月开始，到八月二十日已全部完成，用人工共约一百五十多万个。参加工程领导工作的各级干部达二千五百多人，技工和民工共达四万五千多人。这一工程的完成，不仅黄河下游的平原、河南、山东等三省可以增加安全，苏北、河北等地的广大农田，也可以减轻黄水的威胁。
    为了庆祝这一伟大工程的完成，平原省治黄总指挥部曾于八月二十二日及二十三日在工地上举行庆祝典礼和庆功表模大会。参加大会的有工人、民工和干部等共两万多人，他们之中有二千多人被评选为模范，在大会上光荣地受到中央水利部代表刘钟瑞司长颁发奖品。（新华社）
