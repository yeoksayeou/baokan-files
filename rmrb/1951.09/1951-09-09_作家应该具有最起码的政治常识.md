    Writers Should Possess the Most Basic Political Common Sense

    Literary and art workers must earnestly study politics; no one would object to this principle. But in reality, this is often not the case. Even in some works, it can be seen that our writers still lack the most basic political common sense in certain areas. For example, in Wang Yaping's poems, such phrases appear: "Workers are the vanguard of the proletariat" (see the poem "Ode to Giants" in the poetry collection "Youthful China," published by the Cultural Work Press), "Aid Korea, beat the American bandits, the revolution is a great success!" ("Little Hero Catches a Spy," published in "Current Affairs Handbook," Issue 15). These are just examples picked at random. There is no need to do much analysis here. In fact, even an ordinary worker, farmer, or student would know who the vanguard of the proletariat is, that workers are the proletariat, and under what circumstances the revolution can be considered a "great success"—these are all basic political common sense. However, in the works of our people's writers, such unbelievable statements, lacking the most basic political common sense, have appeared. If this is not a printing error, it can very well illustrate how seriously some of our writers lack political study.

    This should be a good lesson for all writers who are unwilling to seriously study politics. To be a people's writer in name and in fact, to shoulder the responsibility of portraying the people's lives and educating the people, one must earnestly study politics; there can be no pretense or falsehood in this.

    作家应该具有最起码的政治常识
    文艺工作者必须认真地学习政治，这个道理是不会有人反对的。但在实际上，情形往往不是这样。甚至在有些作品里，可以看出，我们的作家在某些地方还很缺乏最起码的政治常识。如在王亚平的诗中就有这样的词句出现：“工人是无产阶级的先锋”（见诗集“青春的中国”中的“巨人颂”一诗，文化工作社出版），“援朝鲜，打美贼，革命大告成功。”（“小英雄捉特务”，载“时事手册”第十五期）这些只是信手拈来的一例。在这里是用不着多作什么分析的。事实上，即使是一个普通的工人、农民或者是学生，也都会知道谁是无产阶级的先锋，也都知道工人就是无产阶级，也知道在什么情况下，革命才算“大告成功”这类基本的政治常识的。但是，在我们人民作家的作品里，却出现了这样令人难以置信的，缺乏最起码的政治常识的语句。这里假若不是印刷中的错误，就很可以说明我们的某些作家多么严重地缺乏政治学习。
    对于一切不肯认真学习政治的作家们，这应该是一个很好的教训。要作一个名符其实的人民的作家，要担负起表现人民生活和教育人民的责任，就必须切实学习政治，这是半点做作不得、虚假不得的。
