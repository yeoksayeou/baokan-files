皖南 (Wan Nan) State-Owned Tongguan Mountain Construction Company

    Leading Cadres Lose Their Standpoint and Actually Protect Feudal Headmen

    Editor Comrade:
    In late June, the Anhui South Chizhou Special District Federation of Trade Unions sent cadres to assist the Anhui South Federation of Trade Unions working group to the Tongguan Mountain Construction Company in Tongling County (state-owned, directly under the leadership of the East China Industrial Department; the main responsible persons of the company are Wang Kejing, Li Yaozhong, and Shi Zhengzhen; there are more than 1,200 employees in various industries, mainly engaged in burning brick kilns and breaking stone blocks) to investigate the living conditions of the workers. The results showed that the feudal headman system still existed in the company's construction, and the workers lived a painful life under the exploitation of the feudal headmen.

    Workers Work at Least Thirteen Hours a Day
    Wages are Insufficient for Living, and No One Cares About Illnesses

    The construction projects of the company, both in the past and now, are contracted to thirty-three large and small headmen. Workers have to work at least thirteen or fourteen hours a day, but the monthly salary is only 130,000 to 140,000 yuan. Apart from eating, they cannot solve the problem of clothing, and even have no money to buy yellow tobacco and straw sandals, let alone take care of family life. The workers live in grass sheds, and when it rains, the room is flooded with sewage, and the workers sleep on damp and moldy bunks. In July, more than ten workers fell ill because of this. The company and the headmen never care about sick workers. A worker named Wang Wenkui was sick for more than ten days and did not recover. Therefore, he requested to go home to recuperate. After several requests, the headman gave him 30,000 yuan (and the workers also raised 40,000 yuan for him), and sent him on a boat in the pouring rain. Workers have no washbasins or bathtubs. Workers who make brick blanks work in the sun all day, but there is no cool shed for them to rest in. Originally, the workers managed their own meals, costing 2,300 yuan per day; later, the headmen forced the workers to eat collectively, costing 3,500 yuan per day, but in reality, each person only got 2,600 yuan per day.

    Headmen's Exploitation Reaches Half of the Project Price
    And Illegally Deprives Workers of Personal Freedom

    In the past five or six months, the company contracted the large and small stone excavation project worth 245 million yuan to Jiang Shengji Sand Factory. Jiang Keju, the manager of Jiang Shengji Sand Factory, subcontracted the project to the workers and signed a "contract" with the workers, openly extracting 23 percent of the total project price. Moreover, when converting grain prices, he illegally exploited 20 percent of the workers' wages. Jiang Keju took more than 50 percent of the project price in this project (a huge amount of 120-130 million yuan), and other large and small headmen also exploited workers' wages from tens of thousands to tens of millions of yuan. The Tongguan Mountain Construction Company only cares about contracting out the project and does not care about the serious exploitation suffered by the workers. Another large headman named Li Hua exploited the workers' hard-earned money of more than 50 million yuan when he left Tongguan Mountain.

    The headmen not only cruelly exploit the workers, but even deprive them of their personal freedom. The headman Chu Yutang said to the workers: "I will catch you back wherever you go!" The worker Wang Xiliang found a job on another construction site by himself, but was forced back by the headman. Workers Wang Xiangming, Ji Baoren, and others asked Chu Yutang for wages, but Chu not only did not pay them, but also said that Wang et al. were "inciting strikes" and were "spies." Therefore, he fired three workers on the spot.

    Company Leaders Seriously Lose Their Standpoint
    Obstructing Workers' Struggle Against Feudal Headmen

    The main reason why such serious feudal headman exploitation exists in the company's subordinate work areas is that the company's leadership lacks a clear understanding of the idea of relying on the working class. When the working group went to the company to work, the company's leadership not only did not assist, but instead obstructed it and openly favored the headmen. The working group used the workers' spare time to hold several worker symposiums and a staff meeting (mainly to carry out grievance education). Shi Zhengzhen, one of the main responsible persons of the company, was furious when he learned about it, saying that the working group should not hold meetings to delay production (the meeting was held at night and did not hinder production). Shi Zhengzhen openly favored the headmen, saying: "Boss Chu (referring to the headman Chu Yutang) is a good person. He has saved a lot of money for the public and has lost 7-8 million yuan of his own capital." Recently, the workers refused to sign a "contract" with the headmen, and Shi Zhengzhen said that he would fire the workers who were unwilling to sign this "contract."

    The leadership of the Tongguan Mountain Construction Company does not actively lead and educate the workers to launch a struggle against the feudal headmen, but instead favors the headmen and consciously hinders the working group from carrying out necessary work among the workers. This is a serious manifestation of losing the class standpoint. We hope that the company's leadership will conduct a profound review, and we hope that relevant parties will pay attention to this issue.

    Illegal Building Factories in Shijiazhuang Engage in Speculation and Cause Serious Harm
    The Local Government Should Immediately Ban Them

    Editor Comrade:
    I would like to talk to you about the activities of some speculative building contractors in the construction industry in Shijiazhuang City.

    Since the national economic situation has basically improved, the number of construction projects in Shijiazhuang City has been increasing day by day. Especially since this spring, the construction industry in the city has reached a very busy level. Many owners went to the construction company and pleaded repeatedly, but no one agreed to take on their projects. Under such circumstances, new building firms have developed greatly, and the construction industry has become one of the most prosperous industries in Shijiazhuang.

    Some Building Factories Lack Funds and Do Not Understand Technology
    Speculate in Subcontracting Projects and Engage in Illegal Activities

    In addition to the two larger public building companies, "Shidai" and "Zhongguo," there are forty-nine other building firms in Shijiazhuang City. Of course, many of these forty-nine building contractors are legitimate building contractors, but there are indeed many firms that are speculative in nature. Among these forty-nine building contractors, the persons in charge of thirteen of them are completely laymen in construction. Their original occupations or identities were: electric grinding industry, theater owner, accountant, teacher, student, restaurant owner, stonemason, and house framer, etc. The building factories run by these people sometimes have good helpers, and there are fewer problems; otherwise, disputes arise constantly.

    Some building contractors, after obtaining a registration certificate from the Shijiazhuang Construction Bureau and the Industry and Commerce Bureau, do not operate in this city at all in order to evade inspection and avoid exposing themselves, but contract projects in far away places. For example, Xin Da Building Factory is contracting in Yangquan, Heng Hua Building Factory is contracting in Wei County, Xin Zhong Building Factory is contracting in Niangziguan, and Li Ming Building Factory is contracting in Yanhui.

    Some building factories are approved as third-class building factories when they are registered, and it is stipulated that they should have more than 5 million yuan in funds, and because of the lack of funds, there are certain restrictions on contracting projects. However, even this small amount of funds is sometimes just an empty check. When verifying the funds, they come up with various ways to substitute. On the one hand, there is a lack of funds, and on the other hand, they contract large projects. For example, Xing Hua Building Factory was originally approved as a third-class building contractor, but they actually contracted a large project of several hundred million yuan from a certain logistics department, which far exceeded their capital and technical limits.

    There are also some building factories that have not been approved and registered by the Construction Bureau (about seven according to the survey) that are also contracting projects in the same way. Some are using old registration certificates that should have been revoked to contract projects in other places, or openly hang up signs in this city to solicit business.

    Speculative Building Contractors Combine with Feudal Headmen
    Causing Losses to the State and Seriously Exploiting Workers

    These speculative building contractors have neither sufficient capital nor sufficient technology. When they contract projects, they have the attitude of "making a quick buck." If they make a profit, the state will suffer losses (the main owners are state agencies and enterprises); if they fail and collapse, the state will suffer even greater losses. The new houses built by the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office mostly leak rain; the warehouses of a certain military region logistics department collapsed due to rain and have been rebuilt repeatedly; after the houses of the Dazhong Iron Factory were completed, inspections revealed as many as nine major defects; these have already caused great losses to public and private owners. Some have even caused greater losses to the state because the contractors directly owe or deceive (for example, Xin Zhong Building Factory owed a certain logistics department more than 100,000 kilograms of millet, and the manager of the factory absconded, and this debt has not been recovered until now).

    In terms of exploiting workers, speculative building contractors and feudal headmen use each other. After speculative contractors contract a project, they often rely on feudal headmen to subcontract the project for construction. For example, Rong Ju Building Factory contracted a certain stone cave project and then subcontracted it to the foreman Cui Yushan. When Cui Yushan contracted from Rong Ju Building Factory, it was forty-two catties of rice per cubic meter of stone; when Cui Yushan contracted to the workers, he only gave twenty-five catties of rice per cubic meter of stone. With one transfer, Cui Yushan got seventeen catties of rice on each cubic meter of stone project. In this way, in the projects contracted by speculative building contractors, workers are subject to serious exploitation by feudal headmen.

    Closely Cooperate to Oppose the Feudal Headman System
    Banning Speculative Behavior of Building Contractors

    The contracting system in the construction industry is closely related to speculative building contractors and feudal headmen. Banning the speculative behavior of building contractors is to cooperate with the current struggle against feudal headmen in the construction industry, so this work is very important. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Government agencies have done some work on this work in the past, but the problem has not been resolved. This is because: First of all, the government management departments believe that there are many construction projects and few skilled workers at present, and the old contracting system cannot be abolished and a new system cannot be established all at once, and they believe that it is naked dancing for government departments to work hard alone. Therefore, they have relaxed the management and education of the construction industry ideologically.

    The construction industry trade union has not done enough class education among workers to oppose feudal headmen and speculative building contractors. Therefore, the struggle between construction workers and these feudal headmen and speculative building contractors has not yet reached a sufficient scale. More importantly, the general departments or individuals engaged in construction are directly hindering the elimination of speculative building contractors and the reform of the contracting system. They often only want to save trouble, be quick, and save money. As soon as they find a building contractor, they always say how much money I have, how many houses I want, and I want to move in at what time. They are completely laymen themselves, and they do not pay attention to the experience and lessons that have been published in the newspapers, let alone carefully study the situation of the contractors. They always feel that: it doesn't matter if I am a layman, you have a contract in my hand (as a result, when something goes wrong, the contract does have legal effect, but it cannot offset the debt or plug the holes in the house). What public building factories cannot do, private building contractors promise; what legitimate building contractors cannot do, speculative building contractors promise, and they are very happy instead. Therefore, they can easily find speculative building contractors to contract projects.

    Based on the above situation, I believe that the current work of banning speculative building contractors and further transforming the construction industry in Shijiazhuang City should first be that all relevant parties cooperate with each other and unify their steps, from strictly handling the registration of building contractors to gradually abolishing the contracting system. This can very powerfully cooperate with the struggle against the feudal headman system in the construction industry.

    The above is just a personal opinion, put forward for reference by relevant parties, and hope to attract the attention of relevant parties to this issue.

### 废除封建把头制；取缔投机建筑商！

    废除封建把头制；取缔投机建筑商！
    皖南国营铜官山建筑公司
    领导干部丧失立场竟然包庇封建把头编辑同志：
    六月下旬，皖南池州专区工会办事处，曾派出干部协助皖南总工会工作组到铜陵县铜官山建筑公司（国营，直属华东工业部领导，该公司的主要负责人为王克兢、李耀中、史正镇，共有各业职工一千二百余人，主要工作是从事烧砖窑和打石块），去调查工人生活情况，结果发现该公司施工中封建把头依然存在，工人在封建把头剥削之下过着痛苦生活。
    工人每日工作至少十三小时
    薪资不够生活疾病无人过问
    该公司的建筑工程，过去和现在都是包给三十三个大小把头进行的。工人每日最少要工作十三、四小时，但每月得到的工资仅有十三、四万元，除了一个人吃饭外，不但穿衣服问题解决不了，甚至连买黄烟、草鞋的钱也没有，更无法照顾家庭生活。工人们住的是草棚，一下起雨来，室内污水横流，工人就睡在潮湿发霉的铺板上；七月份就有十多个工人因此病倒了。公司和把头对有病工人是从来不过问的。有一个叫王文魁的工人病了十多天，不见痊愈，因此他请求回家休养，经过几次要求，把头给了他三万元（另外工人们也给他凑了四万元），就在倾盆大雨的日子里将他抬上了轮船。工人们没有脸盆、澡盆。作坯子（砖坯）的工人整天在暴日下工作，却没有一个休息的凉棚。原先工人自搞伙食，每天吃二千三百元；以后把头强迫工人集体吃饭，每天要吃三千五百元，实际上每天每人只吃到二千六百元。
    把头剥削达工程价款之半
    并非法剥夺工人人身自由
    五、六个月以来，该公司将价款二亿四千五百万元的大小石方工程，先后包给蒋生记砂厂，蒋生记砂厂经理蒋克举又将此项工程转包给工人；并和工人订定“合同”，从全部工程价款中公开抽取百分之二十三的费用。而且在粮款折价时，他又非法剥削了工人百分之二十的工资。蒋克举在这项工程中总共夺取工程价款的百分之五十以上（共一亿二、三千万元之巨），其他大小把头又从中剥削工人工资数十万到数千万元不等。铜官山建筑公司只要自己将工程出包了就算完了，对工人所受到的这样严重的剥削，根本不加过问。另一个名叫李华的大把头，当他离开铜官山时，竟剥削了工人血汗共五千多万元。
    把头不但残酷地榨取工人，甚至连工人的人身自由也给剥夺了。把头褚玉堂向工人说：“你们走到那里我也要把你们抓回来！”工人王希良自己到另一工地找工作，结果被把头强迫回来了。工人王向明、纪宝仁等向褚玉堂要工资，褚不但不给工资，反说王等是在“鼓动罢工”，是“特务”，因此当场就开除了三个工人。
    公司领导干部严重丧失立场
    阻碍工人反封建把头的斗争
    该公司所属工区所以存在着如此严重的封建把头剥削，该公司领导方面对依靠工人阶级的思想不明确是最主要的原因。工作组到该公司进行工作时，该公司领导方面不但不予协助，反而居中阻挠，公然袒护把头。工作组曾利用工人业余时间开了几次工人座谈会和一次职工大会（主要是进行诉苦教育），该公司主要负责人之一的史正镇知道了，对工作组大发脾气，说工作组不该开会耽误生产（大会是在晚上开的，并未妨碍生产）；史正镇并公然袒护把头说：“褚老板（指把头褚玉堂）人好，替公家省了不少钱，自己还赔了七、八百万元的本。”最近工人曾拒绝与把头签订“合同”，史正镇即表示要开除不愿在这“合同”上签字的工人。
    铜官山建筑公司的领导方面，不积极领导教育工人展开反对封建把头的斗争，反而袒护把头，并有意识地阻挠工作组在工人中进行必要的工作，这是严重地丧失了阶级立场的表现，我们希望该公司的领导方面进行深刻的检讨，并希望有关方面对这个问题加以重视。
    中共皖南池州地方委员会  小平
    石家庄不法建筑厂进行投机为害严重
    当地政府应即加以取缔编辑同志：
    我想和你谈一谈关于石家庄市的建筑业中某些投机建筑厂商的活动情况等问题。
    自从全国经济情况基本好转以来，石家庄市的建筑工程一天比一天增多。尤其是今年春季以来，全市的建筑业达到了忙得不可开交的程度。有不少的业主跑到建筑公司经过再三的恳求之后，结果还是没有人应承他的工程。在这种情况下，新的建筑厂号大大地发展起来了，建筑业成了石家庄最兴盛的行业之一。
    某些建筑厂资金不足不懂技术
    投机转包工程，进行非法活动
    全石家庄市除了“时代”和“中国”两家较大的公营建筑公司以外，其余共有四十九户建筑厂号。这四十九户建筑厂商中当然很多都是正当的建筑厂商，但确也有不少的厂号，是具有投机性质的。这四十九户建筑商中有十三家的负责人对建筑根本是外行，他们原来的职业或身份是：电磨业、戏院老板、会计、教员、学生、饭馆老板、石匠、搭房架子的等。这些人所主持的建筑厂，有时找到好帮手，问题就少些；否则就不断发生纠纷。
    有些建筑厂商在石家庄建设局和工商局领得登记证后，为了逃避检查，避免露马脚，根本就不在本市营业，而是在很远的地方去承包工程。如新大建筑工厂是在阳泉包工，恒华建筑工厂是在威县包工，新中建筑工厂是在娘子关包工，立铭建筑工厂是在岩会包工。
    有些建筑厂，登记时批准为三等建筑厂，规定应有资金五百万以上，因为资金少，承包工程也有一定的限制。但是就是这样少的资金，有时也是一张空头支票，验资时，他们想出种种办法来顶替。一方面是资金不足，另一方面又包大工程，如兴华建筑工厂，本来经批准为三等建筑商，但是，他们竟承包了某后勤部几亿元的大工程，远超过了他们的资本和技术的限度。
    还有一部分未经建设局批准登记的建筑厂（据调查约七家），也在照样包揽工程，有的用着已经应该缴销的旧登记证，在外埠包工，或公然在本市挂着招牌，招揽生意。
    投机建筑厂商与封建把头结合
    造成国家损失并严重剥削工人
    这些投机建筑商，既没有足够的资本，又缺乏足够的技术，他们承包工程时，抱着“捞一把”的态度。他们捞着了，国家就受了损失（主要业主都是国家机关和企业）；他们捞不着而垮台时，国家则要受到更大的损失。石家庄专署建筑的新房屋大部漏雨；某军区后勤部的仓房，被雨淋倒，一再重修；大众铁庄的房屋建成之后经检查竟有九处重大毛病；这些，都已经使公私业主受到了很大的损失。有的更因为承包商直接亏欠、拐骗（如新中建筑工厂亏欠某后勤部小米十万多斤，该厂经理潜逃，这项亏款到现在还无从追索），而使国家受到更重大的损失。
    在剥削工人方面来说，投机建筑商与封建把头互相利用。投机商承包下工程以后，往往是依靠封建把头，把工程转包出去施工。例如荣聚建筑工厂承包了某处石洞工程以后，又转包给包工头崔玉山。崔玉山向荣聚建筑工厂承包时是四十二斤米一石方；崔玉山包给工人时，每石方只给二十五斤米。一转手间，崔玉山就在每一石方工程上得到十七斤米，这样，在投机建筑商承包的工程中，工人都受到封建把头的严重剥削。
    密切配合反封建把头制度
    取缔建筑厂商的投机行为
    建筑业中的包工制度和投机建筑商以及封建把头是密切相连的，取缔建筑商的投机行为，就是配合了目前建筑业中反对封建把头的斗争，所以这一工作是非常重要的。对于这一工作，石家庄市政府机关过去是做了一些工作，但还没有解决问题。这是因为：首先是政府的管理部门，他们认为：目前建筑工程多，技术工人少，一下子去不了旧的包工制度，也建立不起来新的制度，认为只是政府部门努力，那是裸体跳舞。因此，从思想上就放松了对建筑业的管理及教育。
    建筑业工会方面，在工人中进行反对封建把头，反对投机建筑商的阶级教育，确也做得不很够，因此，建筑业工人和这些封建把头及投机建筑商之间的斗争，也还没有足够的规模。更重要的，一般进行建设的部门或私人，更是直接妨碍着取缔投机建筑商和改革包工制，他们往往只图省事，图快，图省钱。一找到建筑商，总是说我有多少钱，我要多少房子，我要在什么时间就住进去。自己根本外行，也不注意报上已发表过的经验教训，更不用心研究承包者的情况。总觉得：我外行不要紧，你有合同在我手里（结果出了事情，合同确有法律效用，但是不能抵补欠款，也塞不住房子上的漏洞）。公营建筑厂不能做的，私营建筑商答应了；正当建筑商不能做的，投机建筑商答应了，他们反而很高兴。因此他们很容易找到投机建筑商承包工程。
    根据以上情况，我认为目前石家庄市取缔投机建筑商并进一步改造建筑业的工作，首先应该是各有关方面都配合起来，互相合作，统一步调，从严格办理建筑厂商的登记到逐渐取消包工制。这样就可以很有力地配合反对建筑业中封建把头制度的斗争。
    以上仅是个人的一点意见，提出来供有关方面参考，并希望能引起有关方面对这一问题的注意。
