The health work in various national minority areas across the country has been initially launched and has made significant achievements in the past two years.

Before liberation, under the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the health conditions in various national minority areas were extremely poor, various diseases were rampant, and the population reduction rate reached an alarming level. After the founding of the Central People's Government in October 1949, it first used its great strength, with the assistance of Soviet experts, to quickly extinguish the plague that occurred in Inner Mongolia and Chahar North. In 1950, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government allocated 10 million catties of millet as subsidies for health undertakings in minority areas; in 1951, it allocated more than 9.3 million catties of millet as free medical expenses for the people of various minority nationalities. In January of this year, the Nationalities Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government jointly notified major administrative regions that various specialized courses and secondary medical schools established in medical colleges across the country should specially enroll students from minority nationalities.

The plague in Inner Mongolia used to be very serious. In 1947, more than 13,000 people died, and in 1948, more than 1,500 people died. After liberation, the People's Government established specialized institutions to mobilize the masses to actively carry out prevention and control, and many areas have basically stopped the occurrence of the plague. In 1950, only 22 cases of plague occurred in Inner Mongolia, with 17 deaths. In Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan Province, venereal disease is the disease that harms the people the most. 30% to 80% of the people in various pastoral areas suffer from venereal diseases, and the fertility rate has generally decreased. In individual villages in Inner Mongolia, there are no children under the age of fifteen in the entire village. In response to this situation, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government has determined that the prevention and treatment of syphilis is the focus of health work, established three syphilis prevention and treatment stations, two banner prevention and treatment centers, and ten prevention and treatment sub-centers, and trained a large number of health cadres. Up to now, the stations have examined 14,643 syphilis patients, cured 3,990, and 4,758 are currently being treated. Last summer vacation, more than 70 teachers and students from the Peking University School of Medicine formed a "Syphilis Eradication Team" to work in the Mongolian areas of Suiyuan, which greatly promoted the prevention and treatment of syphilis in the local area. The work of syphilis prevention and treatment has had a significant impact on population birth. From last year to May of this year, the population born in the areas of Chen Barag Banner in Inner Mongolia that have undergone syphilis prevention and treatment has increased by 146 people.

In the Northwest region, Qinghai Province has newly established nine county health centers in Huangzhong, Huzhu, and Dulan after liberation. Xinjiang Province has carried out medical education for secondary medical staff and nurses. Last year, the province sent more than 30 young people from various ethnic groups to study at Peking University School of Medicine and Tianjin Military Medical University. The Health Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee sent an epidemic prevention team to Alxa Banner in Ningxia Province to carry out venereal disease prevention and treatment work, which has made great achievements. The 7th Detachment of the General Epidemic Prevention Team of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has worked in 14 ethnic minorities in Gansu and Qinghai for nine months since July last year, treating 123,000 patients in initial and follow-up visits, vaccinating more than 10,000 people, and training more than 800 midwives and a group of epidemic prevention cadres. The Health Group of the Central Northwest Visiting Group traveled with the group to Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang and other provinces, investigating the health conditions of various places and the medical and health needs of various ethnic groups, and donated medicines and equipment worth 1.5 billion yuan to the people of various ethnic groups.

During the visit, the health group of the Central Southwest Visiting Group, together with the health workers in the Southwest region, treated 26,572 illnesses for the people of various ethnic minorities in Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces, donated a large number of medicines to the people of various ethnic groups, and opened a number of short-term primary health personnel training courses in various places. Up to now, governments at all levels in the Southwest have organized 26 mobile medical and epidemic prevention teams and two medical teams, which regularly go deep into various ethnic minority areas to work. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province and the Tibetan areas where various ethnic groups live together, 16 county-level public health centers and health clinics have been restored and established one after another in the past year. When the health workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army passed through various ethnic minority areas, they also carried out health work locally. After the signing of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government successively sent three medical working groups to Tibet to investigate health and medical conditions, carry out medical work, and allocate 4 billion yuan for medical expenses for the Tibetan people.

The Health Group of the Xiangxi Visiting Group of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee treated and vaccinated more than 16,500 people in the Miao, Yi and other ethnic minority areas in 14 counties including Yongshui and Fenghuang, and cooperated with local people's governments to train more than 200 vaccinators. Not long after the liberation of Hainan Island, the People's Government established a health center in the minority autonomous region in Wuzhi Mountain, and then established health centers in various counties. The 4th Detachment of the Guangdong Provincial Epidemic Prevention Brigade stationed in Hainan Island has entered the minority areas of Wuzhi Mountain twice to assist the local medical and epidemic prevention work.

In the past two years, the medical and epidemic prevention teams in various ethnic minority areas have gone wherever there are diseases, and have gone deep into remote areas, making many achievements. Health work in ethnic minority areas has not only initially improved the medical and health conditions of various ethnic groups, but also promoted the unity of various ethnic groups. Recently, the National Ethnic Health Conference convened by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government in accordance with the decision of the Government Affairs Council has determined the direction and tasks of ethnic health work, and health work in ethnic minority areas will be further expanded in the future.

    全国少数民族地区两年的卫生工作
    全国各少数民族地区的卫生工作，两年来已初步展开，并作出了显著的成绩。
    解放以前，在国民党反动政府残酷的压迫和剥削下，各少数民族地区的卫生情况是非常恶劣的，各种疾病严重地流行，人口减少率达到惊人的程度。一九四九年十月中央人民政府成立后，首先就以极大的力量，在苏联专家的协助下，迅速扑灭了内蒙、察北所发生的鼠疫。一九五○年，中央人民政府财政部拨发小米一千万斤，作为少数民族地区卫生事业补助费；一九五一年又拨小米九百三十余万斤，作为免费替各少数民族人民治病的费用。今年一月，中央人民政府民族事务委员会、卫生部、教育部曾联合通知各大行政区，在全国各医学院开办的各种专修科及中级医士学校中，应特别招收少数民族学生。
    内蒙区的鼠疫，过去流行的情况很严重，一九四七年曾死亡一万三千余人，一九四八年曾死亡一千五百余人。解放后，经人民政府设立专门机构发动群众积极进行防治，许多地区已基本上停止了鼠疫的发生。一九五○年内蒙区只发生了鼠疫病例二十二例，死亡十七人。在内蒙区及绥远省，性病是危害人民最大的疾病。各游牧地区的人民百分之三十到八十患有性病，生育率普遍降低。内蒙个别村庄，全村没有十五岁以下的孩子。针对这种情况，内蒙区自治政府确定了以防治梅毒为卫生工作的重点，建立了三个梅毒防治站，两个旗的防治所，十个防治分所，并培养了大批卫生干部。到目前，各站所已检查梅毒患者一万四千六百四十三人，治愈三千九百九十人，现正在治疗的有四千七百五十八人。去年暑假，北京大学医学院师生七十余人组成的“驱梅大队”到绥远蒙民地区工作，对当地的梅毒防治，起了很大的推动作用。梅毒防治工作已对人口的出生发生了显著的影响。从去年到今年五月，内蒙陈巴尔虎旗经过梅毒防治的地区，出生的人口就增加了一百四十六人。
    西北区青海省在解放后新设立了湟中、互助、都兰等九个县卫生院。新疆省开展了中级医士、护士的医学教育工作。该省去年曾派各民族青年三十多名，分别入北京大学医学院和天津军医大学学习。西北军政委员会卫生部派防疫队到宁夏省阿拉善旗进行性病防治工作，作出很大的成绩。中央人民政府卫生部防疫总队第七大队从去年七月起，在甘肃、青海的十四个少数民族中工作了九个月，治疗初诊复诊患者十二万三千人，种痘一万余人，训练了接生员八百余人和一批防疫干部。中央西北访问团卫生组，曾随团遍历甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等省，调查各地卫生情况和各族人民医药卫生的要求，并曾以价值十五亿元的药品器材赠送给各族人民。
    中央西南访问团的卫生组在访问期间，曾会同西南区的卫生工作人员，为西康、云南、贵州等省的各少数民族人民治疗疾病二万六千五百七十二次，赠送了大批药品给各族人民，并曾在各地开办了一些短期的初级卫生人员训练班。到目前为止，西南各级人民政府已组织了二十六个巡回医疗防疫队和两个医疗组，经常深入各少数民族地区工作。西康省的藏族自治区及各族杂居的西藏地区，一年来已先后恢复和建立了十六个县的公立卫生院和卫生所。中国人民解放军的卫生工作人员经过各少数民族地区时，也曾在当地展开卫生工作。西藏和平解放的协议签字后，中央人民政府卫生部曾先后派出三个医疗工作组赴西藏调查卫生医药情况，进行医疗工作；并拨款四十亿元作藏族人民医疗费用。
    中南军政委员会湘西访问团的卫生组，曾在永绥、凤凰等十四个县的苗、彝等少数民族地区，为一万六千五百多人治疗疾病和种痘；并协同各地人民政府训练了种痘员二百余人。海南岛解放不久，人民政府即在五指山设有少数民族自治区卫生所，后又分别在各县设立卫生所。驻在海南岛的广东省防疫大队第四分队，曾两次进入五指山少数民族地区，协助当地作医疗防疫工作。
    两年来，各少数民族地区的医疗防疫队是那里有病就到那里，深入边远地带，作出了很多成绩。少数民族地区的卫生工作不但初步改善了各族人民中的医药卫生情况，也促进各民族团结。最近中央人民政府卫生部依照政务院决定召开的全国民族卫生会议，确定了民族卫生工作的方针、任务，少数民族地区卫生工作今后将进一步展开。（新华社）
