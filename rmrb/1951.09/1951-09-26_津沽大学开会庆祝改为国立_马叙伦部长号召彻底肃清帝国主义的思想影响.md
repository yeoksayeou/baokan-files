    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 25th: Tianjin's Jin沽University held a grand celebration yesterday with over 1,600 faculty, staff, and students to mark the school's transition to a national university and to hold a reception ceremony. Ma Xulun, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, Zhang Zonglin, Deputy Director of the Higher Education Department, Huang Jing, Mayor of Tianjin, Huang Songling, Director of the Municipal Cultural and Educational Committee, Li Zhuchen, former Chairman of the University's Board of Directors, and Zhou Shutao, former Director, attended the meeting to provide guidance.

    Huang Songling, Chairman of the conference, delivered the opening remarks, followed by the handover ceremony. Li Zhuchen, the former Chairman of the Board of Directors, presented the transfer document to Minister Ma Xulun. Minister Ma then spoke amid enthusiastic applause. He first congratulated Jin沽University on becoming a national university and extended cordial greetings to all faculty and students. Minister Ma then put forward three instructions on how to run Jin沽University well in the future: First, it is necessary to clearly recognize the government's policy of running universities, which is to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate and educate advanced construction personnel. Second, it is necessary to continue to vigorously eliminate imperialist slave ideology and cultivate patriotism. Jin沽University has been greatly influenced by imperialist ideology in the past, and this ideological toxin must be thoroughly eliminated. Third, all faculty, staff, and students should unite under the leadership of the president, regardless of religious belief, gender, or age, and, in accordance with the people's education policy, work together to run Jin沽University well and cultivate a large number of advanced construction personnel who love the motherland and serve the people wholeheartedly for the country. Finally, Minister Ma, on behalf of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, announced that Mr. Zhang Guofan had been nominated as the President of Jin沽University and Mr. Li Baozhen as the Vice President. Mayor Huang Jing extended congratulations to the faculty, staff, and students of the university on behalf of the people of the city and thanked the Board of Directors for their many beneficial educational works. He called on all faculty, staff, and students to continue their efforts to thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialism, strengthen patriotic education, improve their physical fitness, and develop towards a regular national university. Li Zhuchen, the former Chairman of the Board of Directors, pointed out in his speech that the faculty and students of Jin沽University have achieved great victories in the struggle against imperialism since liberation. After the establishment of the Board of Directors, partial reforms were carried out. Now the level of awareness of the faculty and students has been further improved. In view of the fact that higher education must be handled by the government, the Board of Directors applied to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government to take over the university. Now that the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has approved it, we express our firm support. Zhang Guofan, the newly appointed President of the University, and representatives of the University's Trade Union and Student Union unanimously expressed in their speeches that they would resolutely respond to the call of the leaders and strive to build a regular national university.

    津沽大学开会庆祝改为国立
    马叙伦部长号召彻底肃清帝国主义的思想影响
    【新华社天津二十五日电】天津津沽大学师生员工一千六百余人于二十五日隆重举行庆祝该校改为国立大学及接收典礼。中央人民政府教育部部长马叙伦、高等教育司副司长张宗麟、天津市人民政府市长黄敬、文教委员会主任委员黄松龄、该校前董事长李烛尘、前董事周叔弢等均到会指导。
    大会主席黄松龄致开会词后，即举行接交仪式。由该校前董事长李烛尘将移交书呈给马叙伦部长，接着马部长在热烈掌声中讲话。他首先祝贺津沽大学改为国立大学并向全校师生致亲切的慰问。接着，马部长对今后如何办好津沽大学提出三项指示：首先要明确认清政府办高等学校的方针，这个方针就是要用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想来培养教育高等建设的人材。其次，要继续大力肃清帝国主义的奴化思想，培养爱国主义思想。津沽大学过去曾经受过不少帝国主义思想的影响，这种思想毒素必需彻底加以肃清。第三，全体师生员工应该不分宗教信仰，不分男女老幼，大家团结在校长的领导下，本着人民教育的方针和政策，大家同心协力办好津沽大学，为国家培养大批热爱祖国、全心全意为人民服务的高等建设人材。最后，马部长并代表中央人民政府教育部宣布，已经提请任命张国藩先生为津沽大学校长，李宝震先生为副校长。黄敬市长代表全市人民向该校师生员工致贺，向作了许多有益的教育工作的董事会致谢。他号召全体师生员工继续努力，彻底肃清帝国主义的影响，加强爱国主义教育，好好锻炼身体，向正规的国立大学发展。该校前董事长李烛尘在讲话中指出，津沽大学师生解放后在反对帝国主义斗争中取得很大胜利。成立董事会以后，又进行了局部的改革。现在师生觉悟程度更加提高。董事会鉴于高等教育必需交由政府办理，所以申请中央人民政府教育部接办。现在中央人民政府教育部已经批准，我们表示坚决拥护。该校新任校长张国藩及该校工会、学生会代表在讲话中一致表示坚决响应各位首长的号召，为建设一座正规的国立大学而努力。
