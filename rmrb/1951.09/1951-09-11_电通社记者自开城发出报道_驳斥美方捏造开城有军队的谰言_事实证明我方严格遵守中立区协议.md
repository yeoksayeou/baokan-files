Xinhua News Agency, 10th. A dispatch from Kaesong by Telecommunications Agency reporter Shen Jiantu on the 9th: Despite Ridgway's threats that negotiations will be "interrupted again" and his blatant aerial and ground actions to undermine the neutrality of Kaesong, the Kaesong neutralization agreement is still being strictly observed by the Korean and Chinese sides. A certain authoritative source here declared: Unless Washington breaks off the negotiations, we will strictly abide by the Neutral Zone Agreement. Rumors that there are "tanks" and "the main force of a division" in the neutral zone are fabricated to support Ridgway's argument for finding a new meeting place, in order to create new obstacles in the path of resuming negotiations.

During the two-plus weeks of interrupted negotiations, I did not see any visible increase in neutral zone police personnel. Today I drove through the entire city and its suburbs in a jeep, and I did not see a single heavy machine gun or anti-aircraft gun, even though Ridgway's troops are using this as an opportunity to undermine the Neutral Zone Agreement from the air and ground. In the eight days since the second bombing of the neutral zone by American planes on September 1 (from September 1 to September 8), American planes flew over Kaesong 139 times without being fired upon.

The only tanks I could see were abandoned in the fields and along the roads, with their turrets and tracks blown off. They were painted with white stars and the words "United States of America," and "Assembled July 1950." I saw many such "United States of America" tanks abandoned along the road on my way from Pyongyang to Kaesong.

In the streets and crowded markets, there is no sign of weapons. Farmers in white robes are working in the fields, mostly women. Mothers are bathing their children and washing clothes by the clear streams and waterfalls. The winding and gnarled pine trees, the quaint and picturesque thatched cottages, and the shouts of playing children, all present a peaceful picture. Only the roar of American jets and bombers disrupts this peaceful scene.

However, Ridgway's threat to create more incidents to prove that Kaesong is not an ideal meeting place casts a shadow over the peaceful scene. Ridgway's despicable refusal to deal with the incidents of his air force and ground forces violating the neutral zone foreshadows that any new location will not yield good results. If the U.S. side lacks sincerity, resuming negotiations will not produce any results. Only by prohibiting American planes from flying over Kaesong and punishing Ridgway's troops who violate the neutral zone on the ground can this sincerity be demonstrated.

    电通社记者自开城发出报道
    驳斥美方捏造开城有军队的谰言
    事实证明我方严格遵守中立区协议
    【新华社十日讯】电通社记者沈建图九日自开城报道：尽管李奇微发出谈判将“再遭中断”的威胁和采取公然破坏开城中立的空中与地面行动，但开城中立化协议仍然受到朝中方面的严格遵守。此间某权威人士宣称：除非华盛顿使谈判破裂，我方将严格遵守中立区协议。有“坦克”与“一师军队的主力”在中立区的谣言，是捏造出来支持李奇微要求另找会议新地点的论据的，以便在恢复谈判的道路上设置新的障碍。
    在谈判中断的两个多星期中，我看不到中立区警察人员有任何可以看得见的增加。今天我乘吉普车经过全城和郊外，我看不到一挺重机关枪或一门高射炮，虽然李奇微的军队正是利用这一点，从空中和地面来破坏中立区的协议。美国飞机在九月一日第二次轰炸中立区后的八天中（自九月一日至八日），飞越开城上空一百三十九架次，没有受到过一发炮火的射击。
    我所能够看到的坦克只是抛弃在田野里和道路旁炮塔与履带已被炸掉的坦克。它们漆着白色的星徽和“美利坚合众国”，“一九五○年七月装配”的字样。我在平壤赴开城的途中看到了不少这种抛弃在道旁的“美利坚合众国”的坦克。
    在街上和拥挤的市场里，看不到一件武器。穿白袍的农民在田里劳作，其中多半是妇女。母亲们在清水淙淙的河边和瀑布边给孩子们洗身和浣洗衣服。曲折多节的松树，古雅如画的茅屋，嬉戏的儿童的喊叫，这一切，呈现出一幅和平的图画。只有美国喷气机与轰炸机的隆隆之声才破坏了这幅和平的画面。
    但是，李奇微威胁要制造更多的事件来证明开城不是理想的开会地点，使和平的景象笼罩着一层阴云。李奇微卑鄙地拒绝处理他的空军与地面部队侵犯中立区事件的经过，预示着任何新地点也不会有好结果。如果美方没有诚意，恢复谈判也不会有结果的。只有禁止美国飞机飞临开城上空，惩办地面上侵犯中立区的李奇微军队，才能表现这种诚意。
