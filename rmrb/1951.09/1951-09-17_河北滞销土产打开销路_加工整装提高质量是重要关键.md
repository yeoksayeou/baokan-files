Hebei's Overstocked Native Products Find Sales Outlets: Processing, Packaging, and Improved Quality are Key

    Most of the overstocked native products in Hebei Province have found sales outlets after being processed, packaged, and improved in quality. More than a dozen types of native medicinal materials, such as Bupleurum, Anemarrhena, Scutellaria baicalensis, and Codonopsis pilosula, which were overstocked in Tongxian, Handan, Shijiazhuang and other regions, have been selling well in East China, South China, and other places after processing and packaging; and have turned losses into profits. For example, the Handan freight industry processed Bupleurum and divided it into three grades: upper, middle, and lower. It was bundled and transported to Hankou, where the price of Bupleurum per catty increased from 1,000 yuan to 2,500 yuan, and 15,000 catties were quickly sold. In the past, persimmon cakes in this area were usually strung together and thrown around, covered in dirt, which was extremely unsanitary and affected sales. Last winter, after being processed and packaged in baskets with paper padding, they were well received by customers and are now selling smoothly. Minerals in the mountainous areas of the province, such as Ying stones from Fangshan County and asbestos from Changping County, have been mined by the masses for a long time but could not be sold. The local supply and marketing cooperatives organized the masses to process asbestos into asbestos thread, asbestos rope, and asbestos paper; and Ying stones were combined with other native raw materials to make more than 40 kinds of utensils such as plates, cups, bowls, and bottles, which were in great demand. In addition, the province's mountainous areas produce more than 20 million catties of black dates annually, which are often overstocked, but after the local state-owned wine industry monopoly company used them to brew jujube wine, the sales problem has been fundamentally solved. In addition, sweet potatoes from Tangshan area and water chestnuts from Hejian area have been processed into vermicelli or noodles, which facilitates sales and preservation. Wood and stone products from the mountain goods have also found sales outlets after being processed and manufactured.
    Through the processing and packaging of native products, the weight of some native products has been reduced, thus saving transportation costs and reducing costs. Although the price of Picrasma quassioides in Tongxian Prefecture of the province is equal before and after processing, the weight is reduced by five times after processing, and the transportation cost is also reduced by five times.
    In order to ensure the specifications and quality of goods, state-owned professional companies and cooperatives in the province have now formulated trademarks for some native products. For example, in the processing and packaging of native cloth and pockets, the length, width, warp and weft density, and certain weight are strictly controlled, and dozens of trademarks such as "Crane Brand," "Cannon Car," and "Battleship" have been created, which are sold to Northeast China and Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and other places. The white melon seeds of the Provincial Native Products Company have gained a reputation in Hankou after being processed, packaged in boxes, and trademarked. When local vendors buy goods, they bargain based on the trademark without unpacking the goods. Private merchants with the same quality goods as the company (such as white melon seeds), are difficult to sell even at a 10% lower price because they do not have trademarks. Now the province has driven many private merchants to create trademarks according to the company's processing and packaging methods.
    In promoting slow-selling goods, the province, in addition to widely educating farmers and merchants to start from long-term interests, establish standard samples, and ensure production specifications, has also established many processing factories. The province's cooperatives have 50 processing factories with thousands of workers; Huairou, Miyun and other counties in Tongxian Prefecture have established nine native medicine processing cooperatives, and have driven the masses to form seventeen native medicine processing groups. Twenty-eight freight companies in Handan Town, under the leadership of the town's Native Products Promotion Committee, established a "Native Products Finished Product Inspection Group," which is specifically responsible for checking the sales specifications of each household. When goods with adulteration or reduced quality are found, they are stopped from being sold or criticized in a circular, which also has a great effect.

    河北滞销土产打开销路
    加工整装提高质量是重要关键
    河北省的滞销土产，经过加工整装，提高质量后，大部分已打开销路。通县、邯郸、石家庄等专区滞销的柴胡、知母、黄芩、党参等十几种土产药材，经过加工整装后，已畅销华东、华南等地；且已变赔钱为赚钱。如邯郸货栈业将柴胡加工后，分成上、中、下三种，捆装运销汉口，每斤柴胡价由一千元提到二千五百元，很快销出一万五千斤。该地柿饼过去习惯穿串，到处乱扔，遍是泥土，极不卫生，致影响销路。去冬经过加工装篓，周围垫纸，就受到顾客欢迎，现已畅销无阻。该省山地的矿产，如房山县的英石，昌平县的石绵，虽群众开采已久，但不能销售。该地供销社即组织群众将石绵加工制成石绵线、石绵绳、石绵纸等；英石与其他土产原料结合制成盘、杯、盂、瓶等四十多种器具后，都感供不应求。又该省山地年产黑枣两千多万斤，常年滞销，但该地国营酒业专卖公司用以酿制枣酒后，销路已获得根本解决。此外，唐山专区的白薯，河间一带的荸荠等，由于加工制成粉条或粉面，都便利了出售与保存。山货中之木货、石货等，经过加工制造后，也得到销路。
    通过土产加工整装后，减轻了某些土产重量，因而节省了运费、降低了成本。该省通县专区皮硝加工前后虽折合价格相等，但加工后重量减低了五倍，运费也减低五倍。
    为保证货品规格、质量，该省各国营专业公司、合作社目前已将有些土产制定了商标牌号。如土布、口袋在加工整装中，严格掌握长度、宽度、经纬密度及一定重量等，并创造“鹤牌”“炮车”“战舰”等数十种商标牌号，行销东北及绥远、内蒙古自治区等地。省土产公司的白瓜子，经过加工装箱创立牌号后，在汉口已取得信誉，该地小贩买货时即凭牌号讲价，不再拆包看货。私商与公司同等质量的货物（如白瓜子等），因无牌号，低价百分之十尚难出售。现在该省已带动许多私商按照公司的加工包装办法创造牌号。
    该省在推销冷背货中，除广泛教育农民、商贩从长远利益出发，树立标准货样，保证生产规格外，并建立许多加工工厂。该省合作社已有加工工厂五十个，工人数千名；通县专区怀柔、密云等县，已建立九个土药加工合作社，并带动群众组成十七个土药加工组。邯郸镇二十八户货栈业，在该镇土产推销委员会领导下，成立了“土产成品检查组”，专负责检查各户销货规格，发现掺假或降低质量的货物时，即停止其出售或通报批评，作用亦很大。
