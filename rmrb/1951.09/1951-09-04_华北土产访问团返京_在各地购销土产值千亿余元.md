    The North China Native Products Visiting Group has completed its visits to major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangzhou and returned to Beijing. The group's trip lasted for more than two months. During the visits, the group signed 238 trade contracts and agreements with state-owned companies, cooperatives, and private industrial and commercial sectors in various regions, with a total trade value of 115 billion yuan. They sold a large amount of unsalable native products from North China and helped neighboring regions sell some of their unsalable goods, greatly promoting the exchange of materials between regions.

    The visiting group purchased and sold a large quantity of native products, specialty products, and industrial products in various regions. In northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and southern Anhui, a total of 37 native product exchange contracts and agreements were signed, with a total value of over 11.3 billion yuan. They sold beans from Shanxi and Pingyuan, rapeseed from Chahar and Suiyuan, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, rush mats, potato flour, raisins, and black melon seeds from Hebei, as well as various special handicrafts from Beijing. At the same time, they also ordered a large quantity of bamboo products and pressed salted duck from Nanjing (30 tons ordered by Tianjin, 10,000 ordered by Hebei), as well as tea, alum, and palm bark from southern Anhui. In Shanghai, the visiting group participated in the East China Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference. At the conference, 156 contracts and agreements were signed with public and private enterprises in various regions, with a total value of 95.3 billion yuan. Many unsalable native products from North China, such as natural alkali, straw braid, forsythia, and anemarrhena, were sold. Black dates and small red dates, and pigs were in short supply. By the time they arrived in Hankou, the general native products of North China had been basically sold out, so only agreements and contracts worth 8.2 billion yuan were signed in Hankou. Most of these were exchanges of unsalable medicinal materials with the Central South region. The visiting group also learned that fruits, mountain products, and vegetables from North China, such as grapes, Ya pears, cherries, chestnuts, persimmon cakes, honey peaches, apples, walnuts, almonds, smoked dates, Chinese cabbage, garlic, and Baotou cabbage, could be sold to Guangdong or exported from Guangdong. Medicinal materials that can be sold to Guangdong include Huai yam, rehmannia root, skullcap, licorice, anemarrhena, atractylodes, and ephedra. Native products from Guangdong such as bananas, sugarcane, pineapples, lychees, fresh oranges, olives, star anise, bamboo products, arsenic, rosin, cane sugar, and some aquatic products are also needed in North China.

    In the two months of work, the group gained the following experiences: (1) A native product visiting group organized by provinces and cities with large administrative regions as units plays a great role in long-distance purchases and sales. In this way, regions can exchange what they have for what they lack, which has a good effect on the exchange of materials. (2) The activities of the visiting group should be combined with local native product exhibition and exchange conferences, accept the unified leadership of the conference, consider the key points of business according to the conference's guidelines and plans, and expand transactions through the conference. This makes it easier to attract business. (3) The visiting group should make detailed purchase and sales plans before departure. The management idea must be to both sell and buy, not just sell without buying. Native products must have samples. When promoting unsalable goods, they should be sold with popular goods or sold on credit or on a trial basis to make it easier to close deals. When dealing with private merchants, be careful, calculate accounts clearly, and earnestly achieve mutual benefit, with realistic prices and mutual trust. (4) Publicity should focus on business and be carried out with emphasis. Publicity should be realistic and have scientific explanations. (5) Emphasize the unified leadership of the visiting group, prevent localism between regions and departments, emphasize unity, division of labor, take care of all aspects, and do a good job.

    At present, the native products of East China, Central South, and especially North China have been basically sold out, and the promotion work has gradually become standardized. Except for a few kinds of native medicinal materials (such as Glauber's salt and bupleurum), most of them have sales channels. The question for the future should be how to guide the production of native products in a planned way. This is worthy of attention by the relevant parties. (Finance)

    华北土产访问团返京
    在各地购销土产值千亿余元
    华北土产访问团已从南京、上海、汉口、广州各大城市访问完毕，返回北京。该团此行共历两月余。在访问中，该团与各地国营公司、合作社和私人工商界订立了二百三十八件贸易合同和协议，贸易总额达一千一百五十亿元，销出了大量的华北滞销土产，并帮助邻区推销了一部分滞销货，大大促进了地区间的物资交流。
    访问团在各地大量采购和推销了土产品特产品和工业品。在苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南等地，签订土产交换合同及协议共三十七件，总值达一百一十三亿余元。推销出山西、平原的豆类，察绥的菜籽，河北的红薯、辣椒、蒲包及土豆粉、葡萄干、黑瓜子等，和北京的特种手工艺品多种。同时也订购了南京大量的竹货、板鸭（天津订三十吨，河北订购一万只），及皖南的茶叶、明矾、棕皮等。在上海，访问团参加了华东土产展览交流大会，会上与各地公私企业签订合同及协议共一百五十六件，总值即达九百五十三亿元，华北滞销的土产，如天然碱、草帽辫和连翘、知母等都销出不少，乌枣、小红枣、毛猪等则是供不应求。到汉口时，华北一般土产已基本销尽，故仅在汉口订了价值八十二亿的协议和合同。其中大部分是和中南区交换的滞销药材。访问团同时了解了华北的水果、山货、蔬菜，如葡萄、鸭梨、樱桃、栗子、柿饼、密桃、苹果、核桃、杏仁、薰枣、大白菜、大蒜、包头菜等，都可销到广东或从广东出口，药材中能销到广东的有怀山药、生地、黄苓、甘草、知母、苍术及麻黄等。广东土产如香蕉、甘蔗、菠萝、荔枝、生柑、橄榄、大茴、竹货、信石、松香、蔗糖及部分水产物也是华北所需要的。
    该团在两个月的工作中，获得以下几点经验：（ 一）以大行政区为单位由各省市组织起来的土产访问团，进行远距离购销作用很大。这样，可互通地区间有无，对物资交流起到好的效果。（二）访问团的活动要和各地土产展览交流大会相结合，接受大会的统一领导，根据大会方针计划，考虑业务重点，通过大会扩大交易。这样易兜揽生意。（三）访问团出发前要作出详细的购销计划。经营思想必须是又卖又买，不能光卖不买。土产必须有样品，推销滞销货时应以热货带冷货或赊销试销，才易成交。和私商来往，要仔细，算清账目，切实做到两利，价格实在，双方讲信用。（四）宣传要围绕业务，有重点地进行。宣传要实事求是，有科学说明。（五）要强调访问团的统一领导，防止地区间和部门间的本位主义思想，强调团结，分工负责，照顾全面，作好工作。
    目前，华东、中南、特别是华北的土产已基本销完，推销工作也已逐渐步入正规，除少数几种土产药材（如皮硝、柴胡等）外，一般都有了销路，今后的问题应是如何有计划地指导土产的生产问题，这是值得有关方面加以重视的。（财）
