Model cotton grower Qu Yaoli of Shanxi Province has exceeded last year's highest national yield per unit area. Qu Yaoli's mutual aid team planted a total of 48 mu of cotton this year. Thanks to careful cultivation, the cotton seedlings grew well. The team has now started harvesting new cotton. Field yield assessments estimate that the 48 mu of cotton fields (including 6 mu of dry land) will produce a total of 26,160 jin of seed cotton, an average of 545 jin per mu, more than double last year's average yield of 258 jin. Among them, Qu Yaoli's own 20 mu of cotton fields (all irrigated land) will produce an average of 790 jin of seed cotton per mu; two mu of land will produce more than 830 jin of seed cotton per mu, exceeding the highest national cotton field unit area yield (745 jin) he created last year by about 90 jin.

In response to the state's call to sell and store cotton, the team signed a cotton pre-sale contract with the Yarn and Cloth Company as early as this summer. The team has now sold 1,100 jin of new cotton.

Qu Yaoli wrote to Chairman Mao before National Day. The full text is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

The National Day of the motherland is approaching, and I am indescribably happy.

I am already 48 years old this year. More than ten years ago, I was still a poor peasant. At that time, I thought, "As long as you work, you will get rich," and always wanted to "make a fortune" from growing cotton. In 1941, I tried planting five mu of "S" cotton. Because I had no experience, I only harvested 50 jin of ginned cotton; but the Japanese invaders forcibly requisitioned 150 jin of cotton per mu, and the cotton growers were forced to buy cotton in the market to pay the levy. The following year, I was still not discouraged and planted another four mu, and the yield per mu increased slightly. The Japanese invaders lowered the price of cotton, which was not as cost-effective as growing grain. In 1945, Yan Xishan replaced the rule of the Japanese invaders and extorted the people in the same way. Each jin of ginned cotton was only worth a little more than three jin of wheat, which was not even enough to cover the cost of fertilizer and seeds, and they also robbed me of four livestock. From then on, I never wanted to grow cotton again.

After liberation, the People's Government called on us to grow cotton, provided loans, water carts, guidance on cotton planting techniques, and stipulated reasonable cotton-grain price ratios, and I regained the motivation to grow cotton. Last year, the cotton I grew created the highest record for cotton production in the country. Not only is my life getting better day by day, but the government also gave me rewards. When I received the "Model of High Yield" certificate from the Provincial People's Government, I was really indescribably happy! I know from my own experience that without such a great people's motherland, there would be no happiness for the working people.

This year, my cotton has another bumper harvest. After careful evaluation, the average yield per mu exceeds last year's bumper harvest record by 45 jin, and two mu can exceed last year's by 91 jin. When I see the snow-white cotton all over the ground, I think of our country. Chairman Mao! You think, how can I not love such a motherland? In order to protect our homes and defend our country, I donated ten dan of wheat from the increased production to buy airplanes and cannons. I will continue to work hard in the future!

I have reviewed with the comrades of the mutual aid team more than once that our understanding and love for the motherland are not enough, and our understanding of the role of urban-rural mutual assistance and the working class elder brothers is even worse. In the past, we only knew how to grow cotton to get rich, and stubbornly waited for a high price at home for the surplus cotton, regardless of the interests of the country. This summer, when the People's Government called for the sale of cotton, we sold the stored cotton. Although I and our entire team received the "Model of Cotton Sales" flag from the County People's Government, I really felt ashamed! Now we have gradually realized the importance of the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural mutual assistance for consolidating the motherland, and are determined to make doing a good job in urban-rural mutual assistance one of our patriotic covenants, and ensure timely supply of industrial raw materials. This year, in order to shorten the time for the state to purchase raw cotton, the entire team has signed a contract with the state-owned Yarn and Cloth Company to ensure that new cotton is sold as soon as it is harvested; and we have made a plan to pick and sell all the cotton in fifty days. Our mutual aid team also plans to expand the cotton fields to 60 mu next year (48 mu this year), accounting for 44 percent of the team's cultivated land area, and strive to produce more cotton. I believe that our Chinese peasants have sufficient strength to support the development of industry in the motherland and do not need any "aid" from imperialism.

I would also like to report to you on one more thing: although we have only implemented labor mutual assistance for half a year, it has proven that collective labor is much better than working alone. This spring was dry, and everyone was worried that they would not be able to plant cotton. It happened to rain during Grain Rain, and our mutual aid team immediately started to seize the opportunity to sow the seeds while the soil was still wet. Including soaking and mixing the seeds, the entire team sowed 43 mu in one day, accounting for 93 percent of the total cotton fields. If it hadn't been for the timely mutual assistance, how could our cotton fields have grown better than others? In the summer, cotton aphids appeared, and our entire team mobilized 18 men, women, and children to wipe out the cotton aphids in two days, protecting the growth of the cotton seedlings. We are following the direction you pointed out, implementing labor mutual assistance. In the past half year, we have not only developed agricultural production, but also made progress in my thinking.

Another benefit of labor mutual assistance is that it has brought out everyone's wisdom. I have some cotton planting experience, and in the past I always thought that my method was good and it was not easy to accept scientific knowledge. The farm proposed that 4,000 cotton seedlings could be left per mu, but I always thought it was too dense, not allowing air to circulate and not seeing sunlight. Later, I personally visited the farm, and the problem of air and sunlight could be completely solved with two rows dense and two rows sparse. This changed my conservative thinking and increased the cotton harvest. At first, I didn't quite believe in the effect of cotton oil soap in killing aphids, but after the team's experiment, the effect was very good. Many problems have been solved through collective research in the team. For example, team member Ye Dianwa believed that his land was thin and did not need to be topped; after everyone's field research, they believed that his land was not thin, and if the branches and leaves were not topped, they would grow wildly. He accepted everyone's opinions and topped in a timely manner, increasing the yield of each mu of dry land from 90 jin of seed cotton to 180 jin. In order to strive for a bumper harvest, Gao Jindong wanted to apply 1,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. After everyone's research, his land was fertile, and if more fertilizer was applied, the leaves and stems would grow too vigorously, and the cotton bolls would fall off, so he stopped applying fertilizer, resulting in a harvest of 600 jin per mu. Therefore, several of our households are very interested in the mutual aid team. Our team will continue to learn and master scientific and technological knowledge, and I believe that the yield per unit area of our cultivated land will increase year by year.

We deeply feel how happy it is to live in the new China under your leadership. I love our motherland, and I want to defend our motherland!

With highest respect!

    每亩产棉八百余斤创全国新纪录
    曲耀离上书毛主席报告丰产成绩
    保证新棉随收随卖，支援祖国发展生产
    山西省植棉模范曲耀离今年棉田单位面积产量已超过去年全国最高纪录。曲耀离互助组今年共种棉四十八亩，由于精耕细作，棉苗始终生长良好。现该组已开始收摘新棉。经田间评产估计，全组四十八亩棉田（内有六亩旱地），共可产籽棉二万六千一百六十斤，平均每亩五百四十五斤，超过去年每亩平均产量二百五十八斤的一倍以上。其中，曲耀离自己的二十亩棉田（均为水地），每亩平均可产籽棉七百九十斤；内有二亩地，每亩可产籽棉八百三十斤以上，超过去年他所创造的全国棉田单位面积最高产量（七百四十五斤）九十斤左右。
    该组为响应国家售棉储棉的号召，早在今年夏天，即与花纱布公司签订了棉花预售合同。现该组已陆续售出新棉一千一百斤。
    曲耀离于国庆节前上书毛主席。全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    祖国的国庆节快到了，我心里说不出的高兴。
    我今年已经四十八岁了，十多年前我还是一个贫农；那时我认为“只要劳动，就会富裕”，总想从种棉中“发财”。一九四一年我试种了五亩斯字棉，因为没经验，共摘皮棉五十斤；而日寇每亩就强征棉花一百五十斤，种棉的人被迫到集镇买棉交征。第二年我仍不死心，又种了四亩，每亩产量略有增加，日寇又把棉价压低，还不如种粮食合算。一九四五年，阎锡山代替了日寇的统治，一样地勒索人民，每斤皮棉仅合三斤多小麦，连肥料种籽的花费都不够开销，前后还抢走了我四匹牲口。从此我再也不愿种棉花了。
    解放后，人民政府号召种棉，贷款，贷水车，指导种棉技术，规定合理棉粮比价，我才又提起劲头来种棉。去年我种的棉花创造了全国棉花丰产的最高纪录。不但我的光景一天天上升，政府还给我奖励。当我接到省人民政府给我的“丰产模范”奖状时，心里真是说不出的喜欢！我从自己亲身经历中懂得：没有这样伟大的人民的祖国，就不会有劳动人民的幸福。
    今年我的棉花又丰产，经仔细评产，每亩平均超过去年丰产纪录四十五斤，有二亩可超过去年九十一斤。我看见满地雪白的棉花，就想起我们的国家。毛主席！你想，我怎能不爱这样的祖国呢？为了保家卫国，我从增产中捐献了小麦十石买飞机大炮。今后我还要继续努力！
    我不只一次和互助组的同志们检讨，我们对祖国的认识和爱护还很不够，对于城乡互助和工人老大哥的作用认识更差。过去我们只知种棉发家，把余棉放在家里硬等大价钱，而不顾国家利益。今夏人民政府号召售棉时，我们才把存棉卖掉。我和我们全组虽得到县人民政府的“售棉模范”奖旗，真使我感到惭愧！现在我们已经逐渐认识到工农联盟、城乡互助对于巩固祖国的重要，决心把做好城乡互助当作我们的爱国公约之一，保证及时供应工业原料。今年，我们为了缩短国家收购原棉的时间，全组已与国营花纱布公司订立合同，保证新棉随收随卖；并且做出计划，在五十天内将所有棉花摘完卖完。我们互助组明年还准备把棉田扩大为六十亩（今年四十八亩），占全组耕地面积百分之四十四，争取生产更多的棉花。我相信我们中国农民有充分力量支援祖国发展工业，不需要帝国主义的任何“援助”。
    再向你报告一件事，我们实行劳动互助虽只半年，已经证明集体劳动比单干要好的多。今春天旱，大家都发愁种不上棉。谷雨时可巧落了雨，我们互助组就一齐动手抢湿下种，连泡拌种籽，全组一天即播种四十三亩，占全部棉田的百分之九十三。不是互助种的及时，我们的棉田怎会比别人的长得好呢？夏季生了棉蚜，我们全组又动员男女老少十八个人，两天就把棉蚜扑灭，保护了棉苗的成长。我们走你指示的方向，实行劳动互助，半年来不仅发展了农业生产，且使我思想上也前进了一步。
    劳动互助，对我们的另一个好处是发挥了大家的智慧。我多少有些种棉经验，过去总觉得自己的办法就不错，不容易接受科学知识。农场提出每亩地可以留棉苗四千株，我总认为太稠，不透空气，见不到阳光。后来我亲自参观了农场，两行稠、两行稀，便完全可以解决空气和阳光的问题，这使我的保守思想有了转变，多收了棉花。对棉油皂灭蚜的效果，开始我也不太相信，经过组里试验，效果很好。很多问题经过组里集体研究得到了解决。如组员叶典娃认为自己地薄，不需打切；经大家田间研究，认为他的地并不薄，不打切枝叶就会发狂。他接受了大家意见，适时打切，每亩旱地由九十斤籽花增产到一百八十斤。高进东为了争取丰产，每亩要追肥一千斤，经大家研究，他的田地肥沃，再追肥叶茎长得太旺，棉桃就要脱落，所以不再追肥，结果每亩地收到六百斤。因此，我们几户对互助组都很有兴趣。我们组要再学习与掌握科学技术，相信我们耕地的单位面积产量会年年增加。
    我们深深感到生活在您领导下的新中国是多么幸福，我热爱我们的祖国，我要保卫我们的祖国！
    致以崇高敬礼！
