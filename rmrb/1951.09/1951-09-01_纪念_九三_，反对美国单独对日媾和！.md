    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th. Shenyang, Lushun, and other places are actively preparing to commemorate the "September 3rd" Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

The association also decided to hold a Sino-Soviet people's get-together to entertain Soviet experts who helped Northeast China's economic construction.

    The Jiusan Society Notifies Local Organizations and Members
    Unite the Broad Masses of People in Cultural, Educational, and Scientific Circles
    Oppose the US-UK Draft Peace Treaty with Japan
    [Report from this newspaper] The Jiusan Society, with September 3rd having been designated by the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council as the day of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, has issued a notice to all local organizations to hold grand celebrations in connection with the society's history. The notice stated: "After eight years of arduous resistance, the Chinese people, thanks to our great ally the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan and its dispatch of troops to the Northeast to annihilate one million Japanese Kwantung Army troops, forced the Japanese fascist aggressors to surrender unconditionally. This great victory proves that the Chinese people are not to be insulted, and the sacred unity of the Chinese and Soviet people is enough to destroy any imperialist aggression." The notice pointed out: "Now, in order to realize its evil conspiracy of a separate peace treaty with Japan, US imperialism and its subservient countries have scheduled the illegal peace conference with Japan in San Francisco on September 4th, and have excluded China, which fought against Japan for the longest time, made the greatest sacrifices, and contributed the most, from the conference. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this kind of perfidy by US imperialism, which vainly attempts to exclusively seize the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, thereby using Japan as its military base for aggression against China and aggression against the world, and undermining peace in the Far East and the world." The Society calls on all its members to unite the broad masses of people in cultural, educational, and scientific circles, resolutely oppose the absurd US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan, and unite with the broad masses of peace-loving people in Japan, Asian countries, and countries around the world to jointly oppose this illegal and unreasonable evil act of US imperialism and strive for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.
    In addition to following the instructions of the headquarters to mobilize various branches and grassroots groups to launch discussions on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, the Beijing branch of the society has scheduled a celebration meeting for all members in Beijing on September 2nd to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Various branches and grassroots groups have launched discussions on US imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan and its sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations, and have unanimously expressed their determination to spare no effort to oppose US imperialism's evil conspiracy to use the illegal peace treaty with Japan to openly arm Japan and pave the way for launching a new war of aggression.
                                        Jiusan Society, August 31, 1951
    Mr. Chen Shaokuan, Naval Elder, Speaks Out
    Condemning the Illegal Separate Peace Treaty with Japan by the US and Britain
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 31st. Mr. Chen Shaokuan, a naval elder and currently the chairman of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Association, spoke to this agency's reporter on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, regarding the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan by the United States and Britain. Mr. Chen Shaokuan was one of the receiving officers of the then Chinese government when the Japanese devils surrendered. He said: As pointed out in the repeated statements of Minister Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government regarding the peace treaty with Japan, the return of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China has been clearly stipulated in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration. After the surrender of Japan, they were recovered by the then Chinese government, which is a fact known to the world. US imperialism violated international agreements, occupied our territory of Taiwan after the start of the war of aggression against Korea, and attempted to formalize its occupation in the form of a US-made peace treaty with Japan. The Chinese people cannot tolerate this barbaric behavior of the United States. We must liberate Taiwan. General Chen Shaokuan had personally inspected the South China Sea Islands before the War of Resistance Against Japan. He said: Nansha Island and the Xisha Islands, like the entire Nansha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Dongsha Islands, have always been Chinese territory. Since the Qing Dynasty, the Chinese navy has repeatedly gone to survey them, and the Chinese navy has often patrolled the waters around Nansha Island and the Xisha Islands. Although they were once occupied by Japan during the War of Resistance Against Japan, they were all recovered by the then Chinese government after Japan surrendered. Nansha Island and the Xisha Islands have historically been Chinese territory, just as the Hawaiian Islands are now US territory, which has been recognized by the people of the world. Nansha Island and the Xisha Islands must not be allowed to be invaded by any imperialism in any way. He said: The huge sacrifices made by the Chinese people since the Japanese imperialists' armed invasion of our country on September 18, 1931, until the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan must be compensated. The evil intentions of British and American imperialism to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, rearm Japan, and attempt to take Japan as its base and arsenal for aggression against Asia, and to take the Japanese as cannon fodder for aggression against the people of Asia, will definitely not be realized.
    General Zuo Quan's Son Writes a Letter to the Nation's Revolutionary Martyrs' Families
    Calling for Strengthening Resistance Against US Aggression and Aiding Korea, Consolidating National Defense
    Resolutely Smash the US Conspiracy to Arm Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th. Zuo Shan, the son of the heroic anti-Japanese General Zuo Quan, wrote a letter to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers across the country on the eve of the "September 3rd" victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The original letter is as follows: Dear families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, and families of staff:
    My father, General Zuo Quan, former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eighth Route Army, the predecessor of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, died heroically in the Qingzhang River battle in Taihang Mountain, Shanxi Province, on the front line of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1942. For nine years, like thousands upon thousands of families of martyrs who have lost their parents, siblings, children in the war, I have buried my hatred in my heart and can never forget it! Especially as the "September 3rd" Commemoration Day of Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan arrives, it reminds me that my father's revenge has not yet been avenged, the bloodstains of the martyrs are still fresh, many places destroyed by the Japanese devils have not been fully restored, and the ferocious US imperialism disregards the warnings of the Chinese people, and releases the murderers of our loved ones, the Japanese war criminals, batch after batch, sends troops to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and now blatantly concludes a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearms Japan, and hands the butcher knife of killing to the Japanese reactionaries again, and let it kill peaceful people again. The robber behavior of US imperialism has aroused infinite anger and hatred in our hearts!
    Dear family members! As long as we recall the brutal crimes of the Japanese devils, we must not let US imperialism rearm Japan, and we must not let the American and Japanese robbers carry out the "three-all policy" on our free territory again. Take my hometown, Liling County, Hunan Province, for example. There are 8,000 households in the county that suffered heavily in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and more than 10,000 people were killed. Many places are covered with bones, such as on the mountain in Bali'ao, Sanlian Township, there are more than 30 bodies of people collectively slaughtered by Japanese robbers.
    The great and lovable motherland was exchanged for the blood of revolutionary martyrs. We must not let imperialism trample on our territory again. We must take practical patriotic actions and resolutely smash the US conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan! We must increase production and continue to strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and consolidate national defense forces. We believe that the powerful force of the Chinese people will give the US robbers as heavy a blow as it gave the Japanese devils and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Imperialism is bound to die. Let us inherit the revolutionary spirit of heroic struggle of the martyrs and avenge the revolutionary martyrs who died and the countless affected compatriots! Fight to defend our motherland and build a happy future! Zuo Shan

    九三学社通知各地方组织和社员
    团结广大文教科学界人士
    反对美英对日和约草案
     【本报讯】九三学社以九月三日业经中央人民政府政务院规定为抗日战争胜利日，特通告各地方组织联系该社历史举行盛大庆祝。通告称：“中国人民经过八年艰苦抗战，最后由于伟大友邦苏联宣告对日作战并出兵东北歼灭了一百万日寇关东军，迫使日本法西斯侵略者无条件投降。这个伟大的胜利证明了中国人民是不可侮的，中苏两国人民的神圣的团结，足以摧毁任何帝国主义的侵略”。通告指出：“现美帝国主义及其仆从国家为实现其单独对日媾和的罪恶阴谋，定九月四日在旧金山召开非法的对日和会，且将对日作战最久牺牲最大贡献最多的中国排斥于该项和会之外。中国人民对美帝国主义此种背信弃义，妄想独占抗日战争胜利果实，从而利用日本为其侵略中国、侵略世界的军事基地，破坏远东及世界和平的严重罪行，绝对不能容忍”。该社号召全体社员团结广大的文教科学界人士，坚决反对荒谬绝伦的美英对日和约草案，并联合日本、亚洲各国及世界各国广大爱好和平的人民，一致起来反对美帝国主义此种违法悖理的罪恶行为，争取全面对日媾和”。

    我海军耆宿陈绍宽发表谈话
    斥责美英非法单独对日媾和
     【新华社福州三十一日电】中国海军耆宿现任福建省抗美援朝分会主席陈绍宽将军于抗日战争胜利日六周年前夕，就美英两国非法单独对日媾和对本社记者发表谈话。陈绍宽将军是日寇投降时当时中国政府受降官之一。他说：正如我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长关于对日和约问题屡次声明中所指出的台湾与澎湖列岛之归还中国，已在开罗宣言和波茨坦宣言中明确规定，日本投降后，已为当时中国政府所收回，乃是举世共知之事。美帝国主义违反国际协定在侵朝战争开始后霸占了我国领土台湾，并企图用美制对日和约形式把他的霸占长期化起来，中国人民是不能容忍美国这种蛮横行为的。我们一定要解放台湾。陈绍宽将军在抗日战争前曾亲赴南海诸岛巡视过。他说：南威岛与西沙群岛正如整个南沙群岛及中沙群岛、东沙群岛一样，向来是中国领土。自满清以来，中国海军曾历次前往勘察，并经常有中国海军在南威岛及西沙群岛一带洋面巡逻。抗日时期虽一度被日本占领，但日本投降后已为当时中国政府全部收回。南威岛与西沙群岛历为中国领土正如现在夏威夷岛是美国领土一样，已为全世界人民所公认。南威岛与西沙群岛绝对不容许任何帝国主义用任何方式加以侵略。他说：自一九三一年九月十八日日本帝国主义武装侵略我国以来到抗日战争胜利时止，我国人民付出的巨大牺牲一定要得到偿还。美英帝国主义单独对日媾和重新武装日本，企图拿日本作为其侵略亚洲的基地与兵工厂，拿日本人作为侵略亚洲人民的炮灰的罪恶打算，是一定不能实现的。
    左权将军之子写信给全国烈军属
    号召加强抗美援朝巩固国防
    坚决粉碎美国武装日本阴谋
   【新华社长沙三十日电】英勇殉国的抗日名将左权将军的儿子左山，在“九三”抗战胜利日前夕，写信给全国革命烈士家属和革命军人家属们。原信如下：亲爱的革命烈士家属、军人家属及工作人员家属们：
    我的父亲是中国人民解放军前身——八路军副总参谋长左权将军，一九四二年我的父亲在抗日前线山西太行山清漳河战役中英勇牺牲了。九年来，我也像成千成万在战争中失去自己父母、兄弟姊妹、子女的烈士家属们一样，一直把仇恨埋在心底，一天也不能忘记！特别是在“九三”抗战胜利纪念节到来的时候，想起了我父亲的仇还未报，烈士们的血迹犹殷，许多被日寇摧毁的地方还没有完全恢复，而凶恶的美帝国主义却不顾中国人民的警告，擅自一批一批地释放杀害我们亲人的凶手——日本战犯，派遣军队占领我们的国土台湾，现在更明目张胆地单独对日媾和，重新武装日本，又把杀人的屠刀交给日本反动派，让它重新来杀害和平的人民。美帝国主义的强盗行为，激起了我们心中无限的愤怒和仇恨！
    亲爱的家属们！只要我们回想一下日寇的残暴罪行，我们就决不能让美帝国主义重新武装日本，决不能让美日强盗在我们自由的领土上再来施行“三光政策”。就拿我的故乡湖南醴陵县来说，全县在抗日战争中受害较大的有八千户，被害者在一万人以上，许多地方白骨累累，如在三联乡八里坳的山上，就有被日本强盗集体屠杀的三十多具尸体。
    伟大可爱的祖国是革命烈士们用鲜血换来的，我们决不能让帝国主义再来践踏我们的国土，我们要以实际的爱国行动，坚决粉碎美国单独对日媾和的阴谋！我们要增加生产，继续加强抗美援朝工作，巩固国防力量。我们相信中国人民的强大力量，将会给美国强盗像给日寇、蒋匪帮一样以沉重的打击，帝国主义是一定要死亡的。让我们继承先烈英勇奋斗的革命精神，为死难的革命烈士及无数受害的同胞复仇！为保卫自己的祖国，和建设幸福的将来而奋斗！  左山
