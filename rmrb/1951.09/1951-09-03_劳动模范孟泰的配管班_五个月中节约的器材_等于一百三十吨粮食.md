    Labor Model Meng Tai's Pipe Fitting Team
    Five Months of Saved Materials
    Equal to 130 Tons of Grain
    The pipe fitting team led by Meng Tai, a labor model at a state-owned iron smelting plant in Northeast China, saved materials and expenses equivalent to more than 130 tons of grain in five months this year, becoming a model for cherishing and conserving state materials in Northeast China.
    During the puppet Manchukuo regime, workers at the iron smelting plant where Meng Tai worked often secretly threw good materials into scrap iron piles to resist oppression and exploitation by the Japanese invaders. After the Kuomintang took over, due to the corruption and embezzlement of the receiving personnel, machines were often stolen and damaged, and various damaged equipment and parts were abandoned everywhere. After liberation, in order to ensure the early resumption of production in the factory, the workers launched a campaign to contribute materials in the early stages of resumption of work and collected all usable materials in the factory. Meng Tai, who had more than 30 years of work experience, was one of the most active in this movement at that time.
    The pipe fitting team led by Meng Tai is responsible for repairing water pipes, air pipes, and steam pipes of the iron smelting blast furnace. During the repair work, the factory was very short of materials, and some workers in the team initially held a negative and wait-and-see attitude. Meng Tai, on the one hand, criticized this waiting mentality, and on the other hand, used his own hands and brains to come up with ideas from the scrap iron piles. He patiently sorted out the usable parts one by one, repaired them, and indeed solved many difficulties. Therefore, he further encouraged everyone to give play to their sense of responsibility as masters and actively look for materials. Under his mobilization, workers found many useful materials in the scrap iron piles accumulated over the years. Seeing that they had solved the difficulties of resuming work with their own hands, the workers' morale was very high. Regardless of the wind and rain, they went to turn over the iron piles, repair parts, and install pipes, so that the blast furnace was finally repaired on time. Subsequently, they repaired the pipes of the second and third blast furnaces. Now, all the parts of the cooling equipment of each blast furnace that has resumed production in the factory have been solved in this way.
    For the past three years, the spirit of cherishing and conserving state materials of the pipe fitting team led by Meng Tai has remained consistent. The materials they collected not only ensured the needs of resumption of work, but also had a large amount of savings. These saved materials filled a small house, which the workers affectionately called "Meng Tai's Warehouse." Whenever a construction task is assigned, they first open this "warehouse" to find suitable materials, and try not to go to the factory's large warehouse to collect materials. Usually, they use their spare time to enrich this "warehouse." Therefore, its storage has always been inexhaustible and inexhaustible for several years. In the first five months of this year, they took a total of ten tons of iron pipes and 7,487 various parts from this "warehouse," while they only took four tons of iron pipes and 744 various parts from the factory's large warehouse, which saved the country a lot of materials.
    The pipe fitting team led by Meng Tai not only achieved remarkable results in saving materials, but they are also extremely responsible for the work of installing pipelines. Everyone conscientiously implemented the slogans of "three guarantees" and "four diligences" put forward by Meng Tai. The "three guarantees" are: guarantee no water leakage, no air leakage, and no gas leakage; the "four diligences" are: diligence in watching, diligence in walking, diligence in inspecting, and diligence in repairing. Therefore, although many of the pipe parts they repaired were assembled using waste materials, no accidents have occurred in the past few years. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 劳动模范孟泰的配管班  五个月中节约的器材  等于一百三十吨粮食

    劳动模范孟泰的配管班
    五个月中节约的器材
    等于一百三十吨粮食
    东北某国营炼铁厂劳动模范孟泰所领导的配管班，在今年五个月中，节约各种器材费用等于一百三十多吨粮食，成为东北爱护和节约国家器材的模范。
    在伪满统治时，孟泰所在炼铁厂的工人为了反抗日寇的压迫和剥削，常常暗地把好器材抛到废铁堆里。在国民党接收后，由于接收人员的贪污腐败，机器常被盗卖和破坏，各种损毁的设备和零件遗弃遍地。解放以后，工人们为了保证工厂早日恢复生产，曾在复工初期展开献纳器材运动，并在厂内搜集一切可资利用的器材。有着三十多年工龄的孟泰，当时就是这一运动中最积极的一个。
    孟泰所领导的配管班，担任修理炼铁高炉的水管、风管和蒸气管等工作。在进行修复工作中，厂内器材非常缺乏，最初班内有些工人抱着消极等待的态度。孟泰一方面批判这种等待情绪，一方面自己动手动脑，从乱铁堆上打主意。他耐心地把可用的零件一件件清理出来，加以修理，果然解决了不少困难。于是，他进一步地鼓励大家发挥主人翁的责任感，积极寻找器材。在他的动员下，工人在多年的废铁堆里找出了许多有用的器材。工人看到自己动手解决了复工的困难，情绪非常高涨，不论刮风下雨，都去翻铁堆，修零件和安管道，使高炉终于按时修好。随后，他们又修复了第二座、第三座高炉的管道。现在该厂业已恢复生产的每座高炉的冷却设备的全部零件，就都是这样解决的。
    三年以来，孟泰所领导的配管班爱护和节约国家器材的精神始终如一。他们搜集的器材不仅保证了复工的需要，还有大批积蓄。这些积蓄的器材堆满了一间小屋，工人们亲密地称它为“孟泰仓库”。每当修建任务分配下来的时候，他们就首先打开这个“仓库”去寻找合适的器材，尽量不到工厂的大仓库去领材料。平常他们利用工作的余暇来充实这个“仓库”。因此，几年来它的贮藏总是取之不尽，用之不竭。今年头五个月中，他们从这个“仓库”取出的器材，总计有铁管十吨、各种零件七千四百八十七件，而他们从工厂大仓库领用的，却只有铁管四吨、各种零件七百四十四件，这就给国家节省了大量的器材。
    孟泰所领导的配管班不仅在节约器材上成绩卓著，他们对于安装管道的工作也极为负责。大家认真地执行了孟泰所提出的“三保”、“四勤”的口号。“三保”是：保证不漏水、不漏风、不漏气；“四勤”是：勤看、勤走、勤检查、勤修理。所以，尽管他们修理许多管道的零件都是利用废物装配起来的，但几年来却从没有发生一件事故。（新华社）
