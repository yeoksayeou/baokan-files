"Beijing History" Contains Political Errors
To the Editor:

The book "Beijing History" (compiled by Huang Pingsun, published by Shanghai Ziyue Society, second edition in April 1951, upper volume) contains serious political errors. Take the article "Beijing's Scientific Movement and Scientists" (written by Hu Xiansu) for example; it mistakenly introduces reactionary figures such as Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, and Weng Wenhao.

Now, let's see how the author introduces these degenerates!

What kind of person is Hu Shi? The author says: "Among the professors at Peking University, the most well-known is Hu Shi. His person and his deeds are widely known, so I will not introduce them again..." Finally, he says: "Future historical commentary will probably only remember him as the initiator of the New Culture Movement, while his academic achievements will be quite limited..." Regarding Hu Shi's compromising and reactionary essence, the author only lightly mentions that "as for his political and economic thoughts, they are very backward." What kind of New Culture Movement did Hu Shi "initiate"? The Chinese New Culture Movement, which began with the May Fourth Movement, was a cultural movement of a new democratic nature, belonging to a part of the world proletariat's socialist new cultural revolution. The pragmatist Hu Shi, representing the bourgeois intellectuals, on what basis can it be said that he led this New Culture Movement? History has already reached a conclusion on this issue.

And Fu Sinian, the author says, is "Hu Shi's top student... a stalwart of the May Fourth Movement, who studied at the University of London and the University of Berlin in Germany..." As for the evaluation of this reactionary figure, it is: "He is a man of means, fond of wielding power, and many people fear him. He is good at debate and has a sharp writing style. He once served as a 'Legislative Member,' where he showed his talents. He is not a pure scholar who single-mindedly devotes himself to learning." From these few short sentences, it can be seen that the author does not particularly detest this reactionary element; his only dissatisfaction is that Fu Sinian does not "single-mindedly devote himself to learning."

As for Weng Wenhao, he is: "Mr. Weng has broad knowledge and is rich in administrative talent... After entering politics, when he served as Minister of Economic Affairs, he greatly benefited the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the victory, the situation deteriorated, and it is a pity that he could not foresee the signs and act accordingly..." Weng Wenhao was an important member of the Kuomintang government, but the author says that he "greatly benefited the War of Resistance Against Japan"(!). Isn't this too strange!

Not only are domestic reactionary figures introduced in this way, but the author is also "deeply grateful" for the cultural aggression of American imperialism against China. In the last section of this article, the author specifically introduces the "China Education and Culture Fund Board." Here, the author tells us that this fund is the remaining balance of the Boxer Indemnity returned by the United States, and lists the names of American directors such as Monroe and Dewey. Then, he describes the scope of the Boxer Indemnity's use as "developing scientific knowledge" (?) and "promoting cultural undertakings of a permanent nature" (?), as well as the establishment of a certain library in a certain year and month, the establishment of a certain research institute in a certain year and month... and "funding young scientists to study in Europe and the United States," etc. Finally, the author gives a heartfelt praise: "It has been of great help to the development of China's scientific undertakings." The fact that American imperialism used these things to carry out cultural aggression is not even mentioned here! In his view, America is so "generous" and "friendly"!

### “北京史话”内容有政治错误

    “北京史话”内容有政治错误编辑同志：
    “北京史话”一书（黄萍荪编，上海子曰社发行，一九五一年四月再版，上编）的内容有着严重的政治错误。就拿“北京的科学运动与科学家”（胡先骕作）这篇文章来说吧，它错误地介绍了胡适、傅斯年和翁文灏等反动人物。
    现在，我们看看作者是怎样介绍这些败类的吧！
    胡适是一个什么样的人物呢，作者说：“北京大学诸教授中最知名者，当推胡适，其人其事，世多知者，不再介绍。……”最后说：“将来历史上之评论，恐怕只是新文化运动之倡导人，而学术上之成就，则殊有限。……”对于胡适的妥协与反动的本质，只轻描淡写地说了一句“至于其政治经济思想，则甚落后”。究竟胡适“倡导”了什么新文化运动呢？从“五四”开始的中国新文化运动，是新民主主义性质的文化运动，属于世界无产阶级的社会主义新文化革命的一部分。代表资产阶级知识分子的实验主义者胡适，凭什么说他领导了这个新文化运动呢？对这个问题历史早已有了定论。
    而傅斯年呢，作者说是“胡适的大弟子，……为五四运动健将，曾至伦敦大学，德国柏林大学研究……”至于对这个反动人物的评语，却是：“为人有手腕，喜弄权，人多畏之，善辩说，文笔犀利，曾为‘立法委员’，甚露头角，盖非纯粹专心治学之笃学士。”就这么短短的几句，也可看出作者对这个反动分子并不怎样嫉恶；他所不满意的只是傅斯年不“专心治学”。
    至于翁文灏，则是：“翁氏学问广博，富有行政才，……从政后任经济部长时，对于抗日战争，裨益甚大。胜利以后，局势日非，不能见几而作，殊为可惜。……”翁文灏是国民党政府的重要人员之一，而作者却说他“对于抗日战争，裨益甚大”（！）这不是太令人奇怪吗！
    不但对国内反动派的人物是这样介绍，而且关于美帝国主义对中国的文化侵略，作者也是“感恩备至”的。在这篇文章的最后一节中，作者特别介绍了“中华教育文化基金董事会”。这里，作者告诉我们说，这笔基金是美国退回的庚子赔款余额，并把美国董事孟禄、杜威等人的名字举了出来。接着就叙述庚子赔款用途范围是什么“发展科学知识”
    （？），什么“促进有永久性质之文化事业”
    （？），以及某年某月该会设立什么图书馆，某年某月创办什么调查所……还有“资助青年科学家赴欧美各国留学”等等。最后作者给了一句衷心的赞语：“对于中国科学事业之发展，有莫大之帮助。”对于美帝国主义利用这些来进行文化侵略的事实，在这里连影子也没有！在他看来，美国是多么的“慷慨”、“友善”！
