    “Always Remember Chairman Mao's Words!”
    After receiving Chairman Mao's reply letter, the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs in the Chengxi District of Suzhou City guaranteed to cherish their honor, actively engage in production, and work diligently.
    On July 21st, one hundred and sixty-one families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs in the Chengxi District of Suzhou City, Southern Jiangsu, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to thank the government for its warm care and to report on the work of the Revolutionary Family Association. On August 7th, the Secretariat of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, on behalf of Chairman Mao, wrote back a letter encouraging everyone to cherish the honor of being family members of revolutionary soldiers, actively participate in production and work, and become role models for the masses in various movements. When this letter was solemnly delivered to the Chengxi District Revolutionary Family Association by the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 16th, all the comrades present felt extremely honored by Chairman Mao's reply and enthusiastically cheered and applauded.
    On August 18th, Chengxi District held a representative meeting of all revolutionary soldiers' and martyrs' families in the district to review and discuss preferential treatment work. When the chairman of the meeting announced that Chairman Mao had sent a letter, everyone was extremely excited. They read Chairman Mao's letter several times, and everyone listened carefully. Everyone unanimously thanked Chairman Mao for his concern and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, actively participate in production and work, and become role models for the masses in various tasks. Wu Lin-ti, a model military family member, said: "I will firmly remember Chairman Mao's words, actively engage in production and work. I am the leader of the Women's Federation group, and I guarantee to lead all the women in the group to do a good job in production, catch more pests, strive for a bumper harvest, and donate airplanes and cannons. I will maintain my honor and strive to add glory to glory." Yang A-da, a military family member from Pan Nan Township, said: "In the past, whenever I had a little difficulty, I would ask the government for relief. After listening to Chairman Mao's words, I felt very ashamed. In the future, I guarantee not to have any dependent thoughts, to conscientiously implement the patriotic pact, and to work hard in production." All one hundred and sixty-one families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs in Chengxi District organized a heated discussion to study how to live up to Chairman Mao's expectations. Kong A-jin, a military family member from Shuangdong Township, immediately took action upon hearing Chairman Mao's encouragement to actively engage in production. He got up early in the morning to go to the fields to weed and catch pests, and mobilized all the women in the group to catch insects together. All the revolutionary soldiers' and martyrs' families unanimously decided to display Chairman Mao's letter with great care, saying: "We must always remember Chairman Mao's words!"

    “永远记住毛主席的话！”
    苏州市城西区烈军工属收到毛主席的复信后，保证珍视光荣，积极生产，努力工作。
    苏南苏州市城西区一百六十一户烈军工属，为了感谢政府热心照顾，并报告革命家属分会的工作情况，在七月二十一日写了一封信给毛主席。八月七日，中共中央办公厅秘书室代表毛主席写来一封回信，鼓励大家珍视革命军人家属的光荣，积极参加生产和工作，并在各种运动中成为群众的表率。当这封信在八月十六日由中共苏州市委员会郑重地送到城西区革命家属分会的时候，所有在场同志都为毛主席的回信而感到无比光荣，大家热烈地欢呼鼓掌。
    城西区在八月十八日召开全区烈军工属代表会议，检查和讨论优抚工作。当会议主席报告毛主席有信来了的时候，大家都兴奋极了。他们把毛主席的信读了好几遍，大家都细心地倾听。大家一致感谢毛主席的关心，并表示要听毛主席的指示，积极参加生产和工作，并在各种工作中成为群众的表率。模范军属吴琳珶说：“我要牢牢地记住毛主席的话，积极生产和工作。我是妇女联合会组长，我保证领导全组妇女搞好生产，多捉害虫，争取多收，捐献飞机大炮。我要保住我的光荣，争取光荣上面加光荣。”盘南乡军属杨阿大说：“以前我有一点小困难，就要找政府救济。听了毛主席的话，我感到很惭愧。以后保证不存依赖思想，好好执行爱国公约，努力生产。”城西区全区一百六十一户烈军工属，有组织地展开了热烈讨论，研究怎样才能不辜负毛主席的希望。双东乡军属孔阿金，听到毛主席鼓励他们积极生产，马上就行动起来，一早起身下田拔草、捉害虫，并动员全组妇女一起捉虫。全体烈军工属们一致决议要把毛主席的来信珍重地陈列出来，他们说：“我们要永远记住毛主席的话！    ”苏州市城西区人民政府  叶万钟
