Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: Newspapers in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries have unanimously condemned the United States for manipulating the San Francisco conference and signing a separate peace treaty with Japan as an illegal act. The Soviet "Pravda" published a commentary by Oliekhov on the 11th, stating that the purpose of the so-called "peace treaty with Japan" is to implement the large-scale aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism, primarily to invade the great Chinese people, invade the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving people. The author pointed out that any agreement related to Asian issues cannot be legal or effective without the participation of the most important major country in Asia - the People's Republic of China. Due to disagreement with the US-British draft treaty, India and Burma, which rank second in Asia in terms of territory and importance, also refused to participate in the San Francisco conference. The author also pointed out that the treaty signed in San Francisco does not and cannot have legal force because the Soviet Union did not sign it. The author concluded that the vast majority of people in Asian countries - more than one billion - oppose the illegal "treaty." All peace-loving people oppose and will never recognize this "treaty."
    The Korean "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 8th, stating that the draft treaty proposed by Washington and passed by the San Francisco conference will also be a piece of waste paper that has nothing to do with the people of the whole of Asia who hope for peace and security in Asia, and has nothing to do with peace-loving people all over the world, headed by the great Soviet people. Because the people of all Asia (including the Japanese people) and peace-loving people all over the world resolutely oppose and deny the hypocritical and illegal peace conference held in San Francisco.
    The Polish "People's Tribune" stated that the attendance and speeches of the Soviet, Polish, and Czechoslovak delegations thwarted the imperialists' plan to resolve issues privately among themselves. The exposure of the aggressors will further strengthen the ranks of people around the world who oppose war makers, oppose preparations for war, oppose launching another war, and strive for lasting peace.
    The Romanian "Spark" newspaper pointed out that the San Francisco conference ended with the complete bankruptcy of its initiators, the US and British imperialists. The United States and Britain manipulated this conference to make it a real masquerade, trying to prove that people supported their draft treaty. However, no imperialist trick can hide the fact that representatives from China, India, and Burma did not attend the conference. The newspaper added that the speech by the head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, has become a powerful accusation against the US imperialists' evil plans regarding Japan. The people of Asian countries and all people in the world can see from the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the San Francisco conference the only correct way to achieve peace in Japan and safeguard peace and security in the Far East.
    The Hungarian "People's Voice" newspaper's editorial on the 11th stated that the signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan is a provocation to peace-loving humanity around the world and a sabotage of the cause of peace. The Soviet Union exposed the aggressive goals of the US imperialists at the San Francisco conference, thus making a great contribution to the cause of peace.

    苏联和人民民主国家报纸
    一致斥责美国非法签订单独对日和约
    【新华社十二日讯】苏联和人民民主国家的报纸，一致斥责美国操纵旧金山会议，签订单独对日和约的非法行为。苏联“真理报”十一日刊载奥列贺夫的评论说：所谓“对日和约”的目的是实行美帝国主义大规模的侵略阴谋，首先是侵略伟大的中国人民，侵略苏联和一切爱好和平的人民。作者指出：任何与亚洲问题有关的协定，如果没有亚洲第一个最重要的大国——中华人民共和国参加，都不能是合法的，也不会是有效的。由于不同意美英和约草案，在版图和重要性上居亚洲第二位的国家——印度和缅甸，也拒绝了参加旧金山会议。作者还指出：在旧金山签订的和约并没有而且也不可能有合法的力量，因为苏联并没有签字。作者最后说：亚洲各国绝大多数的人民——超过十亿人——反对非法的“条约”。一切爱好和平的人民反对并且永远不会承认这个“条约”。
    朝鲜的“民主朝鲜”报八日发表社论说：旧金山会议通过的华盛顿所提出的和约草案，也将是和希望亚洲和平安全的全亚洲人民毫不相干的废纸，而且与以伟大的苏联人民为首的全世界爱好和平的人民也没有任何关联。因为全亚洲人民（包括日本人民在内）和全世界爱好和平的人民，都坚决反对和否认在旧金山举行的虚伪而非法的和会。
    波兰的“人民论坛报”说：苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表团的出席及其演说，挫败了帝国主义者在它们中间私下解决问题的计划。侵略者的被揭露，将更加壮大全世界反对战争制造者、反对准备战争、反对发动另一次战争和争取持久和平的人民的队伍。
    罗马尼亚的“火花报”指出：旧金山会议以它的发起人美英帝国主义者的完全破产而告结束。美英两国操纵这次会议，使其成为一次真正的假面跳舞会，它们想证明人们是拥护它们的和约草案的。但是，任何帝国主义的诡计都不能掩盖中国、印度和缅甸的代表都没有出席会议的事实。该报又说：苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯的演说已成为对美帝国主义者关于日本的罪恶计划的强有力的控诉。亚洲各国人民和全世界所有的人民从苏联在旧金山会议上所提出的建议中，可以看出缔造日本和平与维护远东和平与安全的唯一正确道路。
    匈牙利的“人民之声报”十一日的社论说：单独对日和约的签订是对全世界爱好和平的人类的挑衅，是对和平事业的破坏。苏联在旧金山会议上揭发了美帝国主义者的侵略目的，从而对和平事业作了巨大的贡献。
