    National Forestry Administration Conference Concludes
    Determines Strict Prevention of Forest Fires as Top Priority for Forestry Work
    The National Forestry Administration Conference, convened by the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government on the 11th of this month in Beijing, concluded on the 20th. The main purpose of this conference was to determine the national forestry work plan for 1952, and to discuss issues related to forest protection, afforestation, logging, forest product utilization, and cadre training. The participating representatives also extensively exchanged views on long-term forestry construction work in the future.
    In his concluding report to the conference, Liang Xi, Minister of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government, emphasized that the basic characteristics of China's current forest situation are: insufficient resources, increasing demand, and the loss and waste of trees still existing seriously. China's existing forest area accounts for only about 5 percent of the country's land area, and forest areas are mostly located in remote and isolated areas, making it difficult to transport timber. Some areas neglect the organization and leadership of the masses in protecting forests, allowing them to burn and reclaim land, which often causes serious forest fires. These situations not only cause natural disasters to frequently endanger agricultural production, but also affect the country's future industrial construction. Therefore, Minister Liang emphasized that the future forestry work policy must adopt all effective measures to protect forests and mountains, and put strict prevention of forest fires as the top priority in forestry work. Forestry cadres at all levels must actively help mountain people develop mountain production, and fundamentally solve the problem of forest and mountain protection. At the same time, in order to supply the country's future construction timber, it is necessary to rapidly develop natural forest areas, lay forest railways, and engage in rational logging to increase timber supply; on the other hand, it is necessary to rapidly carry out large-scale afforestation, boldly mobilize the masses, and vigorously promote cooperative afforestation. In order to achieve the above policy, the meeting decided to further mobilize the masses to strengthen forest protection work in 1952, increase forest protection agencies and necessary fire prevention equipment, implement the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on saving timber, and strictly manage logging operations and timber acquisition. Secondly, in addition to building water source forests in the four major rivers, including the Huai River, the Yellow River, the Liao River, and the Yongding River, it was also decided that wherever there are barren mountains and wastelands, as long as there is soil, water, people, and seedlings, afforestation bases should be gradually established to prepare for large-scale afforestation. In order to ensure the implementation of these plans, investigation work will be organized in a planned way in 1952, and a large number of forestry cadres will be trained, with special attention paid to training forestry labor models and activists, to lay a solid foundation for long-term forestry construction work.

    全国林业行政会议闭幕
    确定严防山火为林业工作头等任务
    中央人民政府林垦部本月十一日在北京召开的全国林业行政会议已于二十日闭幕。这次会议，主要是确定一九五二年全国林业的工作计划，讨论有关护林、造林、伐木、林产利用和干部训练等问题。与会代表并就今后长期的林业建设工作广泛交换意见。
    中央人民政府林垦部梁希部长在会议总结报告中着重指出，当前我国森林情况的基本特征是：资源不足，需要日广，而林木的损失与浪费情况仍然严重存在。我国现有的森林面积仅占国土面积百分之五左右，林区又多在偏僻边远地带，木材运不出来。有的地区忽视组织与领导群众保护森林，听其烧荒、垦荒，常常引起严重的森林火灾。这些情况，不仅使天灾经常危害农业生产，而且影响到国家将来的工业建设。因此，梁部长强调指出：今后的林业工作方针，必须采取一切有效办法护林、护山，把严防山火列为林业工作中的头等任务。各级林业干部必须主动地帮助山区群众开展山区生产，从根本上解决护林、护山问题。同时，为了供应国家今后建设用材，必须一方面迅速开发天然林区，铺设森林铁道、从事合理采伐，以增加木材供应量；另一方面，必须迅速进行大规模造林，放手发动群众，大力推行合作造林。为了实现上述方针，会议决定在一九五二年内进一步发动群众加强保护山林工作，增设护林机构和防火的必要设备，贯彻中央人民政府政务院关于节约木材的指示，严格管理采伐业务与木材收购。其次，除在淮河、黄河、辽河、永定河等四大河流营造水源林外，并决定凡有荒山荒地的地方，只要有土、有水、有人、有种苗，就要逐步建立造林据点，给大规模造林作好准备工作。为了保证这些计划的实现，一九五二年将有计划地组织调查工作，并大量培养林业干部，特别注意训练林业劳动模范与积极分子，为长期的林业建设工作打下坚强的基础。（新华社）
