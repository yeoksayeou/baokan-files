Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 26th: "Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 24th entitled "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is an Invincible Force." The editorial stated: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has been fighting alongside the Korean People's Army for eleven months under the banner of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country." The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has exemplified patriotism and internationalism, joining hands with the heroic Korean People's Army to shoulder the historical task of defending the peace of the East and the world, and has established great meritorious service. Its glorious achievements will be forever brilliant and immortal.

The editorial pointed out: Under extremely difficult conditions, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have demonstrated that they are an invincible force. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has displayed a high degree of heroism, overcome the American military's superiority in equipment, victoriously carried out battles, and continuously strengthened its own forces. The source of its strength lies in the fact that it is composed of the true sons and daughters of the Chinese people, inheriting the glorious traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which grew and was tempered in the long struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, and arming itself with the patriotism and internationalism of loving its own people and all mankind; it has the backing of the 475 million Chinese people under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the 30 million Korean people who are fighting heroically for the freedom and independence of their motherland, and it is supported and endorsed by freedom-loving people all over the world. Therefore, it is invincible.

The experience gained by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield has further enhanced and developed its combat strength. In the battles with the mercenary troops of American imperialism, it has fully demonstrated superior tactics, causing the American aggressor army to suffer repeated defeats.

The editorial concluded: If American imperialism wants to continue its war of aggression against Korea, then it will inevitably suffer an even more tragic defeat in the face of the united people of Korea and China and the heroic armed forces of the two peoples.

    “民主朝鲜”发表社论
    赞扬我人民志愿军
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】“民主朝鲜”报二十四日以“中国人民志愿军是不可战胜的力量”为题，发表社论。社论说：中国人民志愿军在“抗美援朝保家卫国”的旗帜下和朝鲜人民军并肩作战已十一个月了。中国人民志愿军模范地发挥了爱国主义和国际主义精神，和英勇的朝鲜人民军携起手来，负起保卫东方与世界和平的历史任务，建立了伟大的功勋。它的光荣业绩将永远灿烂不朽。
    社论指出：在极端艰难困苦的条件下，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军表现出它们是不可战胜的力量。中国人民志愿军发挥高度英雄主义精神，克服美军装备上的优势，胜利地进行着战斗，而且不断地加强自己的力量。它的力量的泉源就在于它是真正的中国人民的儿女组成的，它继承了曾在长期反抗国内外敌人的斗争中成长锻炼出来的中国人民解放军的光辉传统，以爱护本国人民和全人类的爱国主义和国际主义精神武装自己；它有着在伟大的中国共产党领导下的四亿七千五百万中国人民和为自己祖国的自由独立而英勇斗争的三千万朝鲜人民做它的后盾，并且受着全世界爱好自由人民的支持和声援。因此，它是不可战胜的。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上所取得的经验，更加增强和发展了它的战斗力量。在和美帝国主义雇佣兵的战斗中，它充分地发挥优越的战术，使美国侵略军屡遭惨败。
    社论最后说：如果美帝国主义要继续进行侵朝战争，那么，它在团结起来的朝、中两国人民和两国人民的英雄武力的面前，一定要遭到更悲惨的失败。
