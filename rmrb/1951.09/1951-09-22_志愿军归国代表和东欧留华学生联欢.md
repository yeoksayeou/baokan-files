Xinhua News Agency, 20th — Representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to China today held a discussion and get-together with Eastern European People's Democratic Republic students at Tsinghua University. The representatives of the Volunteer Army returning to China who attended were Chai Chuanruo, Ji Bingqian, Gao Chao, Dong Lefu, Zhang Fu, Li Jitao, and Wang Yougen, along with twenty-one students from Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary.

Polish student Kleiman, Romanian student Jiang Dongni, Czechoslovak student Fass, Bulgarian student Maudoshu, and Hungarian student Mei Weijia spoke successively. Mei Weijia said in newly learned Chinese: "When we read the newspaper every morning, we always want to see the reports of the Korean War first. We firmly believe that the Chinese and Korean people will surely win, because we have personally seen that New China is becoming stronger and more powerful day by day, and people all over the world are standing behind them."

At the meeting, Eastern European young students gave books, letters of sympathy, commemorative badges and other gifts to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Among them, seventeen letters of sympathy were written in Chinese characters.

Chai Chuanruo recounted the joy and excitement of the front-line soldiers when they received gifts from peace-loving people around the world. He said, "The warm support of the people of the world has further strengthened our determination and confidence in defending world peace."

The meeting was filled with fervent international friendship.
