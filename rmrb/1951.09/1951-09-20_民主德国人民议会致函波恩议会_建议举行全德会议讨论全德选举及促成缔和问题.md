    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, Eighteenth: According to TASS, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a special session on the 15th. After approving the statement made by Prime Minister Grotewohl at the meeting, it adopted a letter to the Federal Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany, signed by the Presidium of the People's Chamber and the chairmen of various parties. The letter suggested that representatives from East and West Germany hold an all-German conference to discuss the holding of all-German elections and the issue of promoting the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.
    The letter pointed out: Germany is facing a serious crisis, and imperialist aggressors are attempting to plunge Germany into a horrific catastrophe. The German people demand peace. Their wishes and rights are to restore German unity, maintain peace, develop the economy for the welfare of the people, and demand the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to guarantee their true sovereignty and national independence, so that the occupying forces of all countries withdraw from Germany. In order to realize the people's wishes before it is too late, Germans should come together and negotiate to reach an agreement between East and West Germany.
    The letter concluded: "For the sake of the fate and future of our nation, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic suggests to the Federal Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany: to hold a joint all-German conference with the participation of representatives from both East and West Germany, in order to make decisions on the following two issues:
    1. On the issue of holding free all-German elections to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany; 2. On the issue of promoting the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. We on this side are prepared to hold negotiations with West German representatives in a spirit of sincerely seeking agreement, and believe it is necessary to hold an all-German conference in the German capital of Berlin as soon as possible."

    民主德国人民议会致函波恩议会
    建议举行全德会议讨论全德选举及促成缔和问题
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国人民议会十五日举行特别会议，在批准格罗提渥总理在会上所发表的声明以后，通过由人民议会主席团及各党派主席签署的一封给德意志联邦共和国联邦议会的信，建议东西德双方代表举行全德会议，讨论举行全德选举及促成缔结对德和约问题。
    这封信指出：德国正面临严重的危机，帝国主义侵略势力正企图把德国投入惨绝人寰的浩劫中。德国人民要求和平，他们的愿望和权利是恢复德国的统一，维持和平，为了人民的福利而发展经济，并要求早日缔结对德和约，以保证他们的真正主权与民族独立，使各国占领军撤出德国。为了在这时机还不太晚的时候实现人民的愿望，德国人应该聚首一堂，为求得东西德之间的协议而进行谈判。
    这封信最后说：“为了我们民族的命运和前途着想，德意志民主共和国人民议会向德意志联邦共和国联邦议会建议：举行东西德双方代表参加的全德联合会议，以便就以下两个问题作出决定：
    一、关于举行全德的自由选举以建立统一、民主与爱好和平的德国的问题；二、关于促成缔结对德和约的问题。我们这一方面已准备本着真诚求得协议的精神与西德代表举行谈判，并认为有必要尽早在德国首都柏林举行全德会议。”
