    The 35th issue of "New Times," published on August 29th of this year, contained an article by Rapitsky entitled "Who Rules America?" The following is a summary: The "Compass Daily" recently published a letter from Welch, sent from Chicago, which stated: "...The State Department's policies originate in the offices of the Socony Mobil Oil Company. From there, it goes to the Pentagon, where it is approved by senior army and navy officers. Once it reaches the Secretary of State's office, it becomes Truman's policy and must be passed immediately by Congress without any damage. When the Rockefeller consortium issues an order to enact new laws or treaties to protect its foreign exploitation, the big and small members of the Senate and House of Representatives are dutifully obedient." This statement is not an exaggeration. A few facts can illustrate the oil monopoly capital's control over American foreign policy. The key position of Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been occupied year after year by Senator Connally from the oil-producing state of Texas; the Democratic leader in the Senate is McFarland from Arizona, whose agent is Senator Lyndon Johnson from Texas—all of whom are servants of the Rockefeller consortium. Most officials in the State Department are directly or indirectly affiliated with oil companies. Secretary of State Acheson's close relationship with Socony Mobil Oil is well known. The Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Near Eastern, South Asian, and African affairs (regions of direct interest to oil monopoly capital) is McGhee, who, according to "U.S. News & World Report," made a fortune in the oil business in Louisiana. The Chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, Nitze, is the former Vice President of Dillon, Read & Co., which has been developing oil businesses in the Near East since the war. Finally, there is Nelson Rockefeller, a direct descendant of Rockefeller, who has been Assistant Secretary of State for many years, in charge of American policy in Latin America. As for Dulles, one of the veterans in formulating American foreign policy, behind him, in addition to his own Sullivan & Cromwell firm and an international nickel company, is the Rockefeller consortium.

    Of course, the monopoly capital that shares the spoils in the State Department is not limited to the oil industry, to be fair. We can point out that Under Secretary of State Webb represents an aircraft company, Assistant Secretary of State Perkins is linked to the interests of the chemical industry, and so on.

    The Rockefeller consortium has the most significant influence in the various institutions of foreign policy, while the Morgan consortium controls the various institutions that control military production. Wilson, the former general manager of Morgan's General Electric Company, is the economic dictator of the United States.

    Agents of the major American monopoly capital corporations occupy important positions in American economic and domestic affairs. They have legalized a system that amounts to plundering public funds, thereby earning staggering profits on arms orders. These profits are the result of soaring prices of goods needed for the expansion plan, for example, since the outbreak of the Korean War, nickel has risen by 750%, rubber by 300%, tin by 125%, zinc by 110%, copper by 100%, cotton by 40%, the cost of heavy bombers has nearly quintupled, and the cost of transport aircraft has doubled.

    The Pentagon symbolizes the alliance between reactionary military cliques and financial oligarchs. The head of the Pentagon is Marshall, who obtained this position because of his close relationship with the Morgan and Rockefeller consortia (Translator's note: Marshall has resigned as Secretary of Defense). His right-hand man, Lovett, is a partner in Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Air Force Secretary Finletter is a member of the American Bankers Association, and Army Secretary Pace is a partner in Pace, Davis & Pace, a company that specializes in serving monopoly capital. Senior generals and admirals are mostly closely related to financial oligarchs. Eisenhower, who commands the armed forces of the Atlantic group, is a favorite of the Rockefeller consortium. Van Fleet, who was recently appointed commander of the Eighth Army in Korea, is the son of a railway tycoon. He became famous in Greece for suppressing the people's liberation movement, which is why he was transferred to Korea.

    谁统治着美国？
    今年八月二十九日出版的“新时代”第三十五期，载有拉皮茨基所作“谁统治着美国”一文，摘要如下：“指南针日报”不久以前发表了惠尔希从支加哥寄来的一封信，其中说：“……国务院的政策是起源于美孚油公司的各办事处的。它从那儿转到五角大楼，获得陆海军高级官员的签准。它一到国务卿办公室，就成为杜鲁门的政策，必须毫无损伤地立即通过国会。当洛克菲勒财团交下命令，要订立新法律或是条约来保护它的国外剥削的时候，参众两院的大小议员们是奉命唯谨的。”这话并不算过分。几件事实就可以说明石油独占资本控制美国对外政策的情况。参院外交委员会主席这一个关键的职位，年年是由产油的得克萨斯州的参议员康纳利占据的；参院的民主党领袖是亚利桑那州的麦克法兰，他的代理人是得克萨斯州参议员林顿、约翰逊——这些都是洛克菲勒财团的仆役。国务院的大多数官员是直接或间接地和各石油公司有关联的。国务卿艾奇逊跟美孚油公司的密切关系不消说了。管理近东、南亚和非洲（对石油独占资本有直接利害关系的地区）的事务的助理国务卿是麦克希，据“美国新闻和世界报道”说，他就是做路易斯安那州的石油生意发了大财的。国务院的政策设计顾问委员会主席尼兹是狄龙——瑞德公司的前副总经理，这家公司战后就在近东发展着石油事业。最后还有洛克菲勒的嫡裔纳尔逊、洛克菲勒，多年来一直做着助理国务卿，掌管拉丁美洲方面的美国政策。至于制订美国对外政策的老手之一杜勒斯，则在他的背后，除了他自己的塞立凡、克仑威尔公司和一家国际镍公司之外，还有洛克菲勒财团。
    当然，在国务院分肥的独占资本，说得公平些，并不限于石油业。我们可以指出副国务卿韦伯代表着一家飞机公司，助理国务卿波金斯联系着化学工业的利益等等。
    洛克菲勒财团在对外政策的各机构中有着最显著的影响，摩根财团则把持着控制军事生产的各个机构。摩根系通用电气公司前总经理威尔生就是美国的经济独裁者。
    美国独占资本的各大公司的代理人占据了美国经济和内政方面的重要职位。他们使一套等于抢劫公共资金的制度合法化了，从而在军火定单上赚取非常惊人的利润。这些利润就是扩军计划所需要的商品价格飞涨的结果，例如自从侵朝战争爆发以来，镍上涨了百分之七五○，橡胶——百分之三○○，锡——百分之一二五，锌——百分之一一○，铜——百分之一○○，棉花——百分之四○，大轰炸机的成本涨了将近五倍，运输机的成本则涨了一倍。
    五角大楼象征着反动军人集团和财政寡头的联盟。五角大楼的首领是马歇尔，他就靠他跟摩根财团和洛克菲勒财团的密切关系，获得了这个职位（译者按：马歇尔已辞国防部长职）。他的得力助手罗维特是布郎兄弟哈里曼公司的合伙人。空军部长芬立脱是美国银行公会会员，陆军部长佩斯是专为独占资本经营业务的佩斯台维斯佩斯公司的合伙人。陆海军高级将领们大都和财政寡头有着密切的关系。统率大西洋集团武装部队的艾森豪威尔是洛克菲勒财团的宠儿。不久前被任为朝鲜第八军司令的范佛里特，是一个铁路大老板的儿子。他在希腊因镇压人民解放运动而出名，这才被调到朝鲜来的。
