I Was Elected Deputy District Head
By Huang Yuehua, Deputy District Head of the Fifth District of Beijing

When the chairman announced from the podium that I was the deputy district head, I couldn't believe my ears. I felt like I was in a dream, my head was spinning, and my ears were buzzing. Everyone was applauding, and my heart was almost jumping out of my chest. I held onto Auntie Su's hand tightly. She said softly, "Don't be afraid, take courage. We have Chairman Mao, we have the Communist Party..."

I recall my life over the past eleven years, and I want to tell all my sisters how the old society trapped me in the abyss of darkness and how the new China cultivated me into a useful person.

Before the War of Resistance, I was a university graduate, and my husband, Wu Zhaofa, was a biologist. We worked together in the laboratory, paying no attention to politics, thinking that science alone could save the country. At that time, I dreamed of becoming a scientist like my husband. The Japanese occupation of Beijing shattered all my dreams. We were trapped in Beijing, and life became more difficult day by day, and we had more and more children. I had to return to the family from the laboratory. From five o'clock in the morning to eleven o'clock at night, I was busy washing clothes, cooking, twisting hemp ropes, and making shoe soles. We ate mixed flour, red sorghum rice, and pickled mustard greens every day. My seven children were all yellow and thin and often sick. The children who were originally in school also dropped out because they couldn't afford the tuition.

In those dark and impoverished days, we did not lose courage and hope, and we looked forward to the arrival of victory.

When we heard the news of Japan's surrender, we were so excited. My children ran into the street with small flags, desperately trying to welcome the Kuomintang army. However, in just a few days, our excitement turned into disappointment. What we welcomed were a group of beasts and their master, the American bandits. They only knew how to oppress us and rob us. I felt extremely painful, even more uncomfortable than during the occupation. I felt darkness all around me. At that time, I didn't know that the liberated areas led by Chairman Mao were a beacon of light.

Beijing was liberated, and our lives immediately became stable. However, we were not as excited as when Japan surrendered, because we had been fooled too badly that time. This time we had to observe very calmly to see whether this government was serving the people or oppressing the people like the Kuomintang.

Like many others, I was first educated by our People's Liberation Army. When we were first liberated, three soldiers of the People's Liberation Army lived in my house. Their actions made our whole family feel, "I never thought there would be such a good army in the world." They made me feel comforted and gave me hope for China's future. In April of the year before last, my eldest child joined the army and went south, and I was very happy because I knew he would receive a good education in the army. In the autumn of the year of liberation, my children, who had been out of school for five years, all passed the entrance exams. I began to brush up on the biology I had put aside for eleven years and started reading the newspaper again.

One day, the cultural and educational section of the district sent me a letter hoping that I would serve as a teacher at the night school. At that time, how happy I was! I thought: I, who had been suppressed at home for eleven years by the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries, am now valued by the People's Government and have the opportunity to come out to work. However, I immediately felt uncomfortable, because I found that I didn't understand anything anymore. Eleven years of family life had made my mind and intelligence regress. I became very timid. I was like a prisoner who had been locked up in prison for eleven years. Chairman Mao suddenly opened the prison door and told me to go out. I jumped up with joy, but I immediately realized that my legs were weak and my eyes had been in the dark for too long, and I couldn't open them when I saw the sunlight. However, I must go out, because outside is the sun. I thought of what the revolutionary leader said: "Study, study, and study again." I ran to the cultural and educational section and told them everything about my situation. I said: Although I cannot take on this job at present, I must prepare to take it on. In this way, I studied earnestly and enthusiastically. Every day, I read the newspaper from the first word to the last; I attended every mass meeting convened by the police station. When a person who has been locked up for a long time sees the door being opened, even running out will feel too slow!

Last August, I was invited to participate in the first district people's representative meeting in the Fifth District. I saw with my own eyes how humbly the government leaders accepted the opinions and demands put forward by the people and how seriously they studied various problems in their work. I deeply realized that the people are the masters of the country. I deeply felt the government's love for the people.

Since then, I have participated in street work and served as a member of the women's representative conference of the Third Police Station, and later I was promoted to deputy director. Last winter, I heard that seven million people in the Huai River disaster area had no clothes to wear, which made me very anxious. I thought: Fortunately, there is this motherly government leading everyone to save those seven million people. If it were the Kuomintang, even if seventy million people froze to death, they wouldn't care. Every day, I followed Comrade Shao, a district representative, to collect winter clothes and learned his propaganda methods in my work. It was dark at night, and Representative Shao always sent me home. Since I participated in mass work, every time I could meet a few smiling faces in the nearby alley, they talked to me very kindly, and the children often ran over to surround me, and I felt unspeakable happiness in my heart. This happiness can never be bought with millet! I often think: How happy the socialist society should be! To get to that society quickly, everyone must come out and work hard. In the past year, many sisters around me who had been buried in their families for a long time have come out to work with us one after another. My children, except for those who are not old enough, are all members of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers. What makes me happiest is that every night, my husband works until late at night, making biological specimen slices. Although this will delay his research work, when he thinks that so many young students need this kind of thing, he continues to make it. He handed over all the remuneration he received from making biological specimen slices to me and sent it to the police station to donate airplanes and cannons to defend our country.

I recall that in the past year of mass work, I have received so much help, friendship, knowledge, and happiness, but what have I done for the people? I have no ability, how can I serve the people of the entire Fifth District? I went to District Head Gu De and told him all my shortcomings. Comrade Gu De said: "If the volunteers only considered their shortcomings and difficulties and only considered that they had no planes or tanks before they set off, could they win the battle?" He also asked me: "What did you do when you had difficulties in your work before?" I said: "Consult with others." He asked again: "What do you do when you encounter something you can't do?" I said: "I go to the masses, and whoever can do it, I will ask him to do it." He said: "You should do the same in the future. Relying on the masses, you will not be afraid of anything, and our Party and the People's Government will lead you and help you." After listening to his words, I thought of the countless difficulties and hardships that the Communist Party had gone through, and I thought of the scene when I had just walked out of the gate a year and a half ago. I made up my mind, and I said to Comrade Gu De: "I am willing to learn."

Editor's Note: Huang Yuehua is forty-six years old this year, from Suzhou, Jiangsu. In 1931, she graduated from the Department of Biology of Soochow University in Suzhou and taught middle school for two and a half years. She came to Beijing in 1935. After marriage, she assisted her husband, Wu Zhaofa, in doing research work in the laboratory until the start of the War of Resistance. During the period of Japanese puppet and Kuomintang reactionary rule, she was forced to give up her research work and engage in domestic labor. After liberation, she was attracted by the new society and participated in street work. She set an example in the work of issuing public bonds and collecting winter clothes, playing a exemplary role. In the autumn of 1950, she was invited to be a district representative of the Fifth District of Beijing. She worked very steadily, studied humbly, and solved problems for the masses. Due to her efforts and mobilization of the masses, the 19th Reading Room was established in the Fifth District, and women's lectures were held, inviting comrades from relevant agencies to give political lessons, health knowledge, and children's education. Now the number of listeners has grown from twenty to more than one hundred. She also played a leading role in the work of donating to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In February 1951, she was elected as the deputy director of the Women's Representative Conference of the Third Police Station in the Fifth District. At the first Fourth Session of the People's Representatives of All Circles in the Fifth District of Beijing held in August, she was elected as the Deputy District Head of the Fifth District.

    我当选了副区长
    北京市第五区副区长  黄月华
    当主席台上宣布我是副区长的时候，我不能相信自己的耳朵，我好像在梦里一样，头晕晕的，耳朵里嗡嗡的，大家都在鼓掌，我的心几乎要跳出来。我紧抓着苏大妈的手。她轻轻地说：“不要怕，鼓起勇气来，有毛主席，有共产党………。”
    我回想起自己十一年来的生活，我要告诉所有的姐妹，旧社会怎样把我陷在黑暗的深渊，新中国怎样把我培养成有用的人。
    抗战以前，我是一个大学毕业生，我的丈夫武兆发是个生物学家。我们一同在实验室里工作，对政治不闻不问，以为光凭科学就可以救国。那时，我梦想自己也和丈夫一样成为一个科学家。日本侵占北京，粉碎了我的一切梦想。我们沦陷在北京，生活一天比一天困难，孩子也越来越多。我只好从实验室回到家庭。每天从早晨五点钟到夜晚十一点，我忙着洗衣，作饭，搓麻绳，纳底子，我们每天吃混合面、红高粱米和腌芥菜。我的七个孩子，都是又黄又瘦，常常生病。原来上学的孩子也都因为缴不上学费而失学了。
    在那黑暗而贫困的日子里，我们并没有丧失勇气和希望，我们盼望着胜利的到来。
    当我们听到日本投降的消息的时候，我们曾是那样的兴奋。我的孩子拿着小旗拼命地往街上跑，去欢迎国民党的军队。可是，不几天，我们的兴奋就变成了失望，我们欢迎来的是一群野兽和它的主子美国强盗。他们只会压迫我们，抢劫我们。我心里痛苦极了，比沦陷时期还难受。我觉得四周都是黑暗。那时候我还不知道毛主席领导的解放区，已是一片光明。
    北京解放了，我们的生活马上就安定下来。可是我们没有像日本投降时那样兴奋，因为那一次我们受骗受得太厉害了。这一次我们要很冷静地观察，要看看这个政府到底是为人民服务的呢，还是像国民党那样欺压人民的。
    我和许多人一样，首先是从我们的解放军那里受到了教育。刚解放的时候，曾经有三个解放军住在我的家里。他们的行动使我们全家都感到：“从来没想到过世界上会有这样好的军队。”他们使我心里感到安慰，感到中国前途有希望。前年四月，我的大孩子参军南下，我是很高兴的，因为我知道他将会在部队里受到良好的教育。解放那年的秋天，我失学了五年的孩子们都考进了学校。我开始温习搁下了十一年的生物学，重新看起报来。
    有一天，区里文教科给我来了一封信，希望我出来担任夜校的教员。当时，我是多么高兴啊！我想：被日本鬼子和国民党反动派压在家里十一年的我，今天受到人民政府的重视，有出来工作的机会了。可是，立刻我就难受了起来，因为我发觉自己已经什么也不懂了。十一年的家庭生活使得我的脑力和智慧都退步了。我变得非常胆小了。我好像一个在监狱里关了十一年的囚犯，毛主席忽然把监门打开了，叫我出去。我高兴得跳起来了，可是我立刻发觉腿是软的，眼睛在黑暗里呆得太久了，见了太阳光一下睁不开来。可是，我一定要走出去，因为外面就是太阳。我想到革命领袖说过的“学习，学习，再学习”。我跑到文教科，把我的一切情况都说了。我说：虽然目前我还担任不了这个工作，但我一定要准备担任起来。这样，我就认真地热情地学习着。每天，我把报纸从第一个字读到最末一个字；派出所召集的每一次群众会，我都参加。当一个长期被关闭着的人，见到大门被打开的时候，就是跑步出去也会嫌慢的啊！
    去年八月我被邀请参加五区第一次区人民代表会议。我亲眼看见政府的首长是多么虚心地接受人民提出的意见和要求，多么认真地研究工作中的各种问题。我深深体会到人民是国家的主人。我深深感到政府对于人民的爱护。
    从此，我参加了街道工作，担任了第三派出所妇女代表会议的委员，后来被推为副主任委员。去年冬天，我听说淮河灾区有七百万人民没衣穿，可把我急坏了。我想：幸亏有这个慈母似的政府领着大伙去救那七百万人民，要是国民党，冻死七千万，他们也不放在心上呀。我每天跟着区代表邵同志出去募寒衣，并在工作中学习他的宣传方法。晚上道黑，邵代表总是送我回家。从我参加群众工作后，每次我都能在附近的胡同碰见几张笑迷迷的脸，他们很亲切地和我谈话，周围的孩子也常常跑过来围着我，我心里感到说不出的快乐。这些快乐决不是用小米能买得到的！我经常想：社会主义社会该是多么幸福啊！要快快走到那个社会，就得每一个人出来努力工作。一年来，我周围许多长期被埋没在家庭里的姐妹，都陆续出来和我们一块工作了。我的孩子们，除了不够年龄的，全都是青年团员和少年儿童队队员。最使我高兴的，是每天晚上，我的丈夫工作到深夜，作生物标本切片。虽然，这将耽误他的研究工作，但他想到有那么多青年学生需要这种东西，他就继续作下去了。他把所有作生物标本切片得来的报酬，交给我送到派出所，捐献飞机大炮，保卫我们的祖国。
    我回想在过去一年的群众工作中，我得到了这么多的帮助、友爱、知识和快乐，可是我替人民作了什么呢？我什么能力也没有，怎么能给全五区的人民办事呢？我去找区长顾德同志，把自己的缺点都告诉了他。顾德同志说：“倘使志愿军出发以前，尽考虑缺点、困难，尽考虑没有飞机、坦克，能打胜仗吗？”他又问我：“你以前在工作中有困难的时候，怎么办的？”我说：“找别人商量。”他又问：“遇到你不会办的事你怎么办？”我说：“我到群众中去找，谁能作，就请他去作。”他说：“以后你也这样办，依靠群众就什么都不怕，并且我们的党和人民政府会领导你，帮助你的。”我听了他的话，想到共产党曾经度过无数的艰难困苦，想起我一年半以前刚刚走出大门时的情景。我决定了，我对顾德同志说：“我愿意学习。”
    编者按：黄月华今年四十六岁，江苏苏州人，一九三一年在苏州东吴大学生物学系毕业，曾教过二年半中学。一九三五年来北京。结婚后，即协助她的丈夫武兆发在实验室里作研究工作，直到抗战开始。日伪和国民党反动统治期间，她被迫放弃研究工作，从事家庭劳动。解放后，她被新的社会所吸引，参加街道工作，在发行公债、募集寒衣工作中以身作则，起了模范作用。一九五○年秋天她被邀请为北京市五区区代表，工作很踏实，虚心学习，为群众解决问题。由于她的奔走、努力和发动群众，在五区成立了第十九阅览室，又举办了妇女讲座，请有关机关的同志讲政治课、卫生常识、儿童教育等，现在听讲的已由二十人发展到一百多人。在抗美援朝捐献工作中她也起了带头作用。一九五一年二月被选为五区第三派出所妇女代表会议副主任委员。在八月举行的北京市第五区第一届第四次各界人民代表会议上，被选为第五区副区长。
