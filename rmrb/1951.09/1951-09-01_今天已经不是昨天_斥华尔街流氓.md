    Today is No Longer Yesterday
    -- Denouncing the Hooligans of Wall Street

    In the war to resist and defeat Japanese fascism, the Chinese people, who endured the longest and hardest struggle, made the greatest sacrifices, and contributed the most, will celebrate their victory day nationwide on September 3rd; while September 4th is the opening day of the San Francisco Conference, instigated by American imperialism, that openly antagonizes the Chinese people and the people of the world. Every Chinese person, as long as they think about this situation even slightly, cannot help but feel anger.
    The days when the Chinese people fought cruelly against Japanese fascism have not passed long ago. The "blockade ditches" and "blockade walls" built by the Japanese invaders still remain in our fields in some places; many villages burned and razed by the Japanese invaders have not yet fully recovered; many people who fought against the Japanese invaders still have scars on their bodies; and many local cadres still suffer from back pain caused by living in tunnels and wild pits. The faces of our murdered relatives, comrades, women, and children still appear before our eyes from time to time. … We have not forgotten all this, and we will never forget it. We are very clear about what kind of hardships we have experienced and what significant price we have paid. We also know how loyally and spiritedly the Chinese people and their armed forces, under the leadership of the Communist Party, fought and made brilliant contributions to the world's anti-fascist war!
    I personally experienced those turbulent struggles with our army. We spent the most difficult years of the War of Resistance against the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's attacks. The Japanese invaders’ "kill all, burn all, loot all" policy to destroy the conditions for our army's survival is unforgettable for life. Whenever the Japanese invaders "mopped up," smoke and fire filled the sky, and even entire villages and towns were burned to the ground. The enemy would not leave you even a small thatched hut. The village where I lived had been burned more than a dozen times. They even smashed your bowls and snatched away your broken shoes and tattered cotton wadding. In the fields, on the roadsides, in the reed marshes, and on the trees, there were dead people everywhere, and even the wells were filled with corpses. I have personally seen elderly people whose bodies were scorched red and black by the sun, and I have also seen the corpses of children who were stabbed to death with dirt in their mouths, they died in pain, biting into the dirt. However, this inhumane cruelty of Japanese fascism did not make the great Chinese people submit. The Chinese people engaged in a decisive battle with them that never stopped for a minute. Although the years were barren and food was scarce at the time, the troops and the people persevered together, filling their stomachs with black beans, leaves, grass roots, wheat seedlings, and ground pears, and fighting tirelessly. Sometimes, in order to take care of the people, the troops would rather endure hunger and leave the leaves for the people. Often, on the way back from battle, many soldiers would faint on the ground due to physical exhaustion. I also remember that at that time, there were many tall machine gunners with large appetites, but because they were Communist Party members, they always let others eat more during meals, and they only ate a little bit themselves, so that they fell down during marches and battles due to weakened physical strength. But then they struggled to get up and charge and shoot at the enemy. This is a brief picture of their arduous battle with the enemy with an indomitable fighting will. Finally, under the guidance of the correct policies, strategies, and tactics of the Party and Chairman Mao, they fought tenaciously and flexibly, annihilated the enemy, and fatally weakened the Japanese fascists' combat power. In the area where I was stationed, under the command of General Yang Chengwu, battles such as the "Great Longhua Annihilation Battle," the "Yansukou Cliff Annihilation Battle," and the famous "Huangtuling Siege Battle" were fought, in which the enemy's so-called "flower of a famous general," Lieutenant General Abe, was killed by us in that battle. These great annihilation battles, as well as the later "Hundred Regiments Offensive," made the enemy panic and fear. Especially due to Chairman Mao's wise strategic policy, the heroic masses, in the heart of the enemy, in the star-studded enemy strongholds and bunkers, created a miracle of people's war in history. Such as landmine warfare, tunnel warfare, joint village operations, and various ever-changing surprise attacks, made it difficult for the enemy to move an inch in the sea of people's war. This made the enemy-occupied areas shrink day by day, and the liberated areas expand day by day. The great Chinese people, in this way, fought with perseverance and extraordinary heroism as fighters on the anti-fascist front, constantly crushing the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracies of surrender and compromise, and finally, with the decisive assistance of the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to Northeast China, achieved victory in the national War of Resistance Against Japan. This glorious contribution of the Chinese people to the anti-fascist war will forever illuminate the history of our great motherland and the history of world humanity! It will always be praised by the people of the world!
    However, the American imperialists insist on obliterating the glorious history of our War of Resistance Against Japan in order to realize their bloody goal of rearming Japan and launching a world war. Here I would like to ask the hooligans of Wall Street and all the shameless followers: The blood shed by the Chinese people, our universally recognized glorious contribution, can it be erased by the rogue methods of you few insignificant scoundrels? What reason do you have to do this? What right do you have to do this? This can only show your ugliness and shamelessness in front of the people of the world! It shows that you are the most despicable rogues and hooligans! And this will tell every Chinese that you are forever their mortal enemies! At the same time, I must also say: You can certainly exclude this great population of 475 million people from the San Francisco Conference, but unfortunately, you cannot exclude them from the earth. They will, together with the people of the world, forever hate you, despise you, until you are buried in the grave.
    I must also tell you: The Chinese people have gained valuable experience in the War of Resistance Against Japan. One of these experiences is: No matter how strong the enemy is, no matter how difficult and tortuous our path is, the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party Mao Zedong and with the assistance of the friendly Soviet Union are great and invincible. The fate of Japanese imperialism is a ready-made example for you. Moreover, I would like to remind you that today is not yesterday. Today's world is not yesterday's world, and today's China is not yesterday's China. The weight of our fists today is different from the weight of yesterday. Since we were able to defeat the Japanese invaders yesterday, we will make you fail more miserably than the Japanese invaders today. Even if you add a character to your aggressive camp, you will only have one more gravedigger. In the Kaesong negotiations, you actually regarded the Chinese and Korean people's forbearance in striving for peace as something that could be deceived. Your shamelessness and barbarity have long been intolerable. The Chinese people warn you: We have already discerned your conspiracies and tricks, we have already understood all your tricks. If you still want to fight, naturally more houses will be allowed to be built in the Korean prisoner-of-war camps. The rope of justice is waiting for you, this small group of war criminals!

    今天已经不是昨天
    ——斥华尔街流氓
    魏巍
    在抵抗和击败日本法西斯的战争中，经过最长期的艰苦奋斗、牺牲最大、贡献最多的中国人民，九月三日全国将庆祝自己的胜利日；而九月四日，就是美帝国主义主使的公然以我国人民及世界人民为敌的旧金山会议的开幕日。每一个中国人，只要稍微想一下这种情形，都忍不住自己的愤怒。
    中国人民与日本法西斯残酷战斗的日子，并没有过去很久。日寇所修的“封锁沟”、“封锁墙”，在有些地方仍残留在我们的田野里；许多被日寇焚烧、平毁的村庄，还没有完全恢复；许多跟日寇作战过的人，身上依然留着伤痕；许多地方干部，在地道中、在野洼里所得的腰疼病，至今还没有好。我们的被杀的亲人、同志、妇女、儿童的面影依旧时时闪现在我们面前。……这一切，我们并没有忘记，也是永远不会忘记的。我们很清楚：我们经过的是什么样的艰难困苦，我们付出的是什么样重大的代价。我们更知道，在共产党领导下的中国人民及其武装部队，是以何等的忠心与气魄进行战斗，给世界反法西斯战争以辉煌的贡献！
    我曾经跟我们的军队一起，亲身经历了那些惊涛骇浪般的斗争。在日寇和蒋介石的夹击中，我们度过了抗战最艰苦的年月。日寇毁灭我军生存条件的“三光政策”，是令人毕生难忘的。每逢日寇“扫荡”的日子，到处是烟火弥天，甚至整个村镇都烧光了，敌人连一间小小的茅棚都不给你剩下。我所住过的村庄，就被烧过十几遍之多。他们连一只碗也给你砸碎，连一双破鞋，一卷破棉絮都给你抢走。田野上、大道边、苇坑里、大树上，到处是被杀死的老百姓，连水井里都堆满了尸体。我亲眼看到过，尸体被晒得焦红乌黑的老年人，也见过被刺死的孩子的尸体，嘴里衔着土块，他是在临死前衔着土块疼死的。然而日本法西斯这种灭绝人性的残酷，并没有使伟大的中国人民屈服。中国人民同他们进行着一分钟都不停止的决死的战斗。虽然当时又年景荒旱，食粮不足，但部队和人民一起坚持下去，以黑豆、树叶、草根、麦苗、地梨充饥，战斗不懈。有时，为了照顾老百姓，部队宁可忍饥挨饿，还把树叶给老百姓留着。往往在战斗的归途上，有许多战士因为身体不支而昏倒在地。我还记得，当时有许多个子高大的机枪射手，饭量很大，但因他们是共产党员，开饭总让别人多吃，自己只吃一点点，以致因为体力削弱在行军作战中跌倒。可是他们接着又挣扎着爬起向敌人冲锋、射击。这就是他们以不屈不挠的战斗意志，同敌人苦战的简要图画。终于他们在党和毛主席正确的政策与战略战术的指导下，顽强而灵活地进行战斗，歼灭敌人，致命地削弱了日本法西斯的作战力量。在我所在的那个地区，在杨成武将军指挥下就打过如“大龙华歼灭战”、“雁宿崖歼灭战”、以及著名的“黄土岭围攻战”等等，使敌人所谓“名将之花”的阿部中将，在该役中被我们击毙。这些伟大的歼灭战以及后来的“百团大战”，都使敌人惶恐畏惧。特别由于毛主席英明的战略方针，使得英勇的人民群众，在敌人的心脏里，在星罗棋布的敌人的据点和碉堡中，创造了历史上人民战争的奇迹。如地雷战、地道战、联村作战以及千变万化的各种奇袭，使敌寇在人民战争的大海中寸步难行。这样使得敌占区日渐缩小，解放区日渐扩大。伟大的中国人民，就是这样以反法西斯战线上艰苦卓绝、英勇卓绝的战士的姿态，坚忍不拔地战斗，并不断粉碎国民党反动派的投降妥协的阴谋，最后，终于在苏联出兵东北的决定性的援助下，取得了全国抗日战争的胜利。中国人民反对法西斯战争的这种辉煌贡献，将永远照耀着我们伟大祖国的历史和世界人类的历史！将永远被世界人民所赞颂！
    可是，美帝国主义者，却硬要抹煞我们抗日战争的光荣历史，以便实现他重新武装日本发动世界战争的血腥目的。我这里请问华尔街的流氓们及一切无耻的随从者：中国人民所流的鲜血，我们被公认的辉煌贡献，难道是你们几个渺小的无赖之徒用流氓手段所能勾消的吗？你们有什么理由这样做？有什么权利这样做？这只能在全世界人民的面前，说明你们的丑恶和无耻！说明你们是最可卑的无赖和流氓！而且这将告诉每一个中国人，你们永远是他们的死敌！同时，我还必须说：你们固然可以把这伟大的四亿七千五百万人民排除在旧金山会议以外，然而遗憾得很，你却并不能把他们排除在地球之外，他们将和全世界的人民一起，永远地仇视你们，卑视你们，直到你们被埋葬到坟墓为止。
    我还必须告诉你们：中国人民在抗日战争中已经取得了宝贵的经验。这经验的一条就是：不管敌人是多么强大，不管我们的道路是多么艰险、曲折，然而在共产党毛泽东领导下、在友邦苏联的援助下的中国人民是伟大而不可战胜的。日本帝国主义的下场，就是给你们摆的现成的样子。而且，我还要提醒一点，就是今天不是昨天。今天的世界不是昨天的世界，今天的中国也不是昨天的中国，今天我们的拳头的重量，已不同于昨天的重量。既然我们能在昨天战胜日寇，在今天也就会使你们失败得比日寇还要悲惨。即使你们的侵略阵营里增加一个脚色，你们也不过多一个殉葬者而已。在开城谈判中，你们居然以中朝人民争取和平的忍让态度为可欺。你们的无耻和蛮横早已经令人不能容忍。中国人民警告你们：我们已经洞悉你们的阴谋鬼计，我们已经清楚你们所有的一些伎俩，你如果还要打，自然朝鲜俘虏营的房子是会被允许多增加几间的。正义的绞绳正在等待你们这一小群战犯！
