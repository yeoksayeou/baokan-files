    Taiyuan City Factory Nurseries Achieve Success

    To the Editor:

    In the past two years, the work of factory nurseries in Taiyuan City has significantly improved along with the development of production. According to statistics: in October 1949, there was only one nursery in the city, caring for 24 children; now there are eleven nurseries in the city, caring for 182 children. There have also been great improvements in equipment, with most having cribs, cradles, strollers, and toys. Management and care have also become increasingly scientific, with set times for eating, drinking, resting, and playing, so the children are very healthy and lively. Female workers with children can send their children to the nursery and concentrate on production. A female worker at Jinsheng Textile Factory said, "Since we have the nursery, I can weave more than one extra yard of cloth a day."

    To improve the work of the nurseries, the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions held a nursery work conference on September 3rd. The meeting summarized two main experiences. Everyone agreed that to run the nurseries well: first, it is necessary to strengthen the political and professional education of the childcare workers, to establish their spirit of serving the childcare cause, and to improve their work enthusiasm; second, to regularly hold forums for childcare workers and the children's mothers to conduct discussions and criticism, and to study how to improve the work. In addition, specific plans were proposed for the leadership of the nurseries: a nursery management committee should be formed by cadres responsible for the nurseries administratively, union labor insurance committee members, female worker committee members, representatives of the childcare workers, representatives of the children's mothers, and doctors. If a nursery cares for more than 20 children, a full-time director should be appointed; if it cares for fewer than 20 children, a part-time director may be appointed. This plan will be specifically studied by the Women Workers Department of the City Federation of Trade Unions in conjunction with relevant departments, and it is recommended that it be adopted and implemented. Regarding the issue of nutritional subsidies for children, industrial systems such as the textile union have already found solutions, while for the cared-for children in other units, the City Federation of Trade Unions has decided to use a portion of the welfare fund to solve the problem. Other issues such as regular health checks for children and organizing mutual visits and learning for childcare workers have also been appropriately resolved.

### 太原市工厂托儿所办理有成绩

    太原市工厂托儿所办理有成绩编辑同志：
    太原市两年来的工厂托儿所工作，已经随着生产的发展，有了显著的提高。据统计：一九四九年十月全市仅有一个托儿所，受托儿童二十四人；现在全市已有十一个托儿所，受托儿童增至一百八十二人。设备方面亦大有改善，一般的都设有小床、摇篮、推车、玩具等。在保育管理上，也逐渐科学化，吃饭、喝水、休息、玩耍都有一定时间，因而孩子们都非常健壮、活泼。有孩子的女职工，把孩子送到托儿所，自己就能安心生产。晋生纺织厂的女工说：“自从有了托儿所，我一天就能多织一码多布。”
    为了办好托儿所，太原市总工会于九月三日召开了托儿所工作会议。在会议中，总结出两点主要的经验。大家认为要办好托儿所：第一，要加强对保育员的政治教育和业务教育，树立其为保育事业服务的精神，提高他们的工作积极性；第二，要经常召开保育员、儿童母亲座谈会，展开讨论和批评，研究改进工作。此外，对托儿所的领导问题，提出了具体的方案：由行政上负责托儿所的干部、工会劳保委员、女工委员、保育员代表、儿童母亲代表、医生等组成托儿所管理委员会；托儿所受托儿童在二十人以上的，应设专职所长，不足二十人的得设兼职所长。这一方案，将由市总工会女工部协同有关部门具体研究，建议采纳执行。关于儿童营养补助问题，纺织工会等产业系统已有解决办法，其余单位的受托儿童，则决定由市总工会用福利金一部分解决。其他如定期给儿童进行健康检查，组织保育员相互参观、学习等问题，都得到了适当的解决。
