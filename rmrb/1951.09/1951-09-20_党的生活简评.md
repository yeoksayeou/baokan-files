    Brief Commentary on Party Life
    Strengthening the Party's Propaganda Work in the Democratic Reform Movement

    To effectively implement the democratic reform movement, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization work. On September 15th, the Wuhan Changjiang Daily published the different approaches of the Luhe City Committee in Henan and the Lingling County Committee in Hunan regarding the propaganda work of the democratic reform movement. The approach of the Luhe City Committee was correct. They organized and mobilized all the reporters, propagandists, and reading groups in the city, using various propaganda forms and methods to vigorously promote the democratic reform movement. This propaganda immediately achieved significant results and positive responses. The awareness of the working class has been universally enhanced, exposing all the conspiracies of the counter-revolutionary elements to win over and deceive, and mobilizing all forces to participate in the democratic reform movement. At the same time, the ideological fluctuations of some industrialists and merchants caused by rumors and sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements have also been stabilized after the propaganda. Lingling County adopted the opposite approach. They only carried out studies on democratic reform within the trade unions, without extensive propaganda and mobilization. Therefore, after the movement was launched, people from all walks of life in the city were inquiring everywhere, listening to hearsay, and failing to obtain a clear and correct understanding of the democratic reform policy. In addition, lurking counter-revolutionary elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, causing ideological confusion among some people. Some people mistakenly believed that "rural land reform distributes land and fruits, and urban democratic reform distributes houses and cloth." A phenomenon of excessive eating and drinking also occurred among merchants. Lingling County has now begun to correct this deviation.

    Carrying out the democratic reform movement is a fierce class struggle. Therefore, it is not only necessary to fully mobilize the working masses to resolutely fight these feudal and reactionary forces to the end, but also to mobilize all revolutionary forces in society to sympathize with and support the democratic reform movement. Facts have proved that the democratic reform movement proceeds smoothly in areas where this is done. Therefore, to comprehensively carry out the democratic reform movement, propaganda work on democratic reform should be carried out vigorously in a planned, organized, and systematic manner.

    党的生活简评
    加强党在民主改革运动中
    的宣传工作要有效地贯彻民主改革运动，必须进行广泛的深入的宣传动员工作。九月十五日武汉长江日报上，登载了河南漯河市、湖南零陵县党委对于民主改革运动宣传工作的不同作法。漯河市党委的作法是正确的。他们组织动员了全市所有的报告员、宣传员、读报组，利用各种宣传形式与方法，大张旗鼓地宣传民主改革运动。这样的宣传立刻得到了显著效果和良好反应。工人阶级觉悟普遍提高，揭发了反革命分子一切拉拢欺骗的阴谋，动员了各方面力量投入民主改革运动。同时，由于反革命分子造谣破坏所引起的部分工商业者的思想波动，经宣传后，也稳定了下来。零陵县则采取了相反的作法，他们只是在各工会内展开有关民主改革的学习，而没有广泛地进行宣传动员，因而运动展开后，城内各界人民到处探听，道听途说，对民主改革政策得不到清楚、正确的了解，加以潜伏的反革命分子乘机造谣，遂引起部分群众的思想混乱。有些人误认为“农村土地改革分田分果实，城市民主改革分房子分布”。商人中也发生了大吃大喝的现象。现在零陵县已经开始纠正这一偏向。
    开展民主改革运动，是一场激烈的阶级斗争。因此不仅仅要充分发动工人群众，坚决与这些封建的反动势力斗争到底；而且还要发动社会上的一切革命力量，使之同情与赞助民主改革运动。事实证明，凡是这样做的地区，民主改革运动就进行得顺利。因此，要全面开展民主改革运动，就应当有计划、有组织、有系统地大张旗鼓地进行民主改革的宣传工作。
