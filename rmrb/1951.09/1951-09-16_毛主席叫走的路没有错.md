Reader's Letters:

    "Chairman Mao's Path is Not Wrong"
    We responded to the call from higher authorities, treated the aphids, and achieved a bumper harvest. Comrade Editor:
    I have been farming for decades, and in the past I only knew "you don't need to learn how to farm, just do what others do." When encountering natural disasters, I never thought of solutions. This year, at the beginning of summer, aphids appeared on the cucumbers and beans, and everyone was helpless, so they had to pull out the seedlings.
    When the rice seedlings were about to spike, insects appeared again. At this time, the District People's Government held a cadre meeting to convey the matter of killing insects. The masses had no confidence. We old farmers also believed that there was no way to kill the aphids. We figured that this year's autumn harvest was over! The cadres repeatedly mobilized, and the school teachers helped households to mix the medicine. I thought: Anyway, there will be no harvest, so let's mix the medicine. Who knew that the medicine really worked! When it was sprayed on the crops, the little black bugs all died stiff! At this time, I felt a pang in my heart, thinking of the cucumbers and beans some time ago, and even more of the great famine in the 31st year of the Republic of China. If we had today's People's Government and today's good cadres at that time, how much less suffering would we have endured! The reactionary government really ruined us!
    The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are really leading everything correctly. This autumn we have a bumper harvest! From this, it can be seen that only the Communist Party is the savior of the people, and the path that Chairman Mao is leading is not wrong. Our country is really good, and we must cherish our country and not let the American devils invade.

### “毛主席叫走的路没有错”

    “毛主席叫走的路没有错”
    我们响应上级号召，治了蚜虫，得了丰收。编辑同志：
    我种了几十年庄稼，过去只知道“庄稼活不用学，人家咋着咱咋着”。碰上一些天灾，从也不去想法。今年开夏，黄瓜、豆角上生了蚜虫，大家没有法，只好把豆角、黄瓜的秧子拔了。
    谷秧快出穗的时候，又生了虫。这时区人民政府召开干部会，传达杀虫的事。群众都没有信心。我们这几个老庄稼人，也认为啥法也治不死蚜虫。心里捉摸今年秋收完蛋啦！干部们一再动员，学校的教员又挨户帮助配药，我想：反正是没收成啦，配药就配药吧。谁知道药水真管事，洒到庄稼上，小黑虫都直挺挺的死啦！这时我心里猛一酸，想起了头些时的黄瓜、豆角，更想到民国三十一年遭受的大灾荒。那时候要是有今天的人民政府，有今天的好干部，我们该少受多少罪啊！反动政府真把我们糟踏坏啦！
    共产党、毛主席真是领导得样样都对，今年秋季丰收啦！由这看来，只有共产党才是人民的救星，毛主席叫走的路没有错。咱们这国家真是好，咱们真要爱护国家，不让美国鬼子来侵略。
