Conscientiously Handle Proposals from People's Congresses
Deputy Mayor of Baoding City, Ding Tingxin

Editor's Note: Proposals from People's Congresses reflect the people's various demands and their opinions on government work. Attaching importance to and conscientiously handling people's proposals is a key link in holding successful People's Congresses. From the news and articles on political power construction that have been published in this newspaper, we can see that the People's Governments in many places attach importance to the people's proposals and handle them responsibly, thereby further strengthening the ties between the People's Government and the people, and establishing the prestige of the People's Congresses among the masses. However, the People's Governments in many places adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the people's proposals. Before the People's Congresses convene, they neither widely collect proposals from the masses, nor seriously handle the proposals raised by the representatives during the meeting. The proposals that have been reviewed and approved by the meeting are not handled in a timely manner, nor are they explained to the people. Individual places even simply cancelled the proposal review committee. As a result, the People's Congresses in many places are held worse each time than the last. Today, the experience of Baoding City, Hebei Province, in handling proposals published in this newspaper is very good. People's Governments in various places should attach importance to this experience and refer to it to improve the handling of people's proposals.

Conscientiously handling proposals from People's Congresses is an important part of holding a successful meeting. For more than two years, we have made achievements in this regard, but upon strict inspection, there are still many shortcomings. From this period of practical work experience, the following issues need to be studied.

I. The collection of proposals must give the representatives sufficient time to go deep among the masses and mobilize them widely. In this way, the demands of the broad masses can be reflected in the meeting. The representatives are also extremely serious about this. Comprehensive ways to collect proposals well in Baoding City include:

(1) Convening symposiums with people from all walks of life, this method is used more often among citizens.

(2) Collecting according to organizational systems, such as workers proposing level by level through trade union organizations, industry and commerce discussing by industry, and teachers and students mobilizing all teachers and students to hold meetings in groups to propose proposals.

(3) Representatives collect from the masses separately, and then jointly study and propose.

It is precisely because the representatives collect proposals so seriously that the vast majority of proposals reflect the urgent demands of the broad masses. For example, in May of last year, when industry and commerce were in a downturn, it was also more difficult for the broad masses of citizens to seek production and livelihood avenues. At the People's Congress convened at that time, among the 264 proposals, 33 proposals were made to solve the problems of citizens' producers, accounting for 12.7% of all proposals. The People's Congress convened in December of the same year focused more on proposals to implement the rent policy and vigorously build houses.

II. The review of proposals must be serious and conscientious, each case must be accounted for, and a proposal review committee including representatives from all walks of life must be organized to review proposals in groups and categories. In the early stage, the review opinions were mostly vaguely put forward as "submitted to the government for reference" or "submitted to the government for research and handling." It was unclear whether to handle it or not. The representatives did not agree with this review method. Some worker representatives once proposed: "Say how to handle it, just say how to handle it, just a vague proposal, there is no way to check it later." After continuous improvement, the review opinions put forward later were required to be as clear and specific as possible. If it can be handled, it will be submitted to the competent department for handling; if it cannot be handled or is postponed, the reasons for not handling or postponing it will be explained. If the original intention of a proposal is unclear, or because the situation is not understood enough, and the review opinion cannot be determined, it is necessary to exchange opinions with the original proposer in advance to avoid perfunctory and hasty handling.

III. After the proposals are reviewed, they are submitted to the plenary meeting for approval in writing. We have adopted two methods: the plenary meeting reviews each item one by one and the group discusses first and then passes it at the plenary meeting. Experience has proved that the latter method saves time and enables representatives to express their opinions widely. However, in the process of group discussion, the group review is often more hasty due to time constraints, so that sometimes after the plenary meeting passes, individual people raise different opinions. The solution to this is to resolve it quickly at the conference if it can be resolved quickly at the conference. If the debate is endless, the proposal review committee and the representatives who raise different opinions will fully exchange opinions outside the meeting, and then submit it to the conference for approval when they are consistent.

IV. Once the proposal is passed and submitted to the government for implementation, it must be handled quickly if it can be handled; if it cannot be handled or is postponed, it must be patiently explained to the original proposer after the meeting; those that have been handled must be explained to the representatives in a timely manner. Although the Municipal People's Government has inspected this, there are still many shortcomings, which are reflected in: some of those who can handle it are not handled in a timely manner, and there is a phenomenon of delay; those who have handled it are generally reported in writing or orally at the next meeting, and there is a lack of timely explanation; those who cannot handle it or are postponed have not been patiently explained, which has caused dissatisfaction among the representatives. Individual proposals have been continuously proposed by representatives.

V. Regarding the procedures for submitting proposals, the original method passed by the representatives' meeting was that one representative made a proposal and another representative seconded it. Later, I felt that this approach was not good, so I changed it to accept all proposals, no matter where they came from, as long as they were sent by representatives, to show respect for the people's opinions. This is beneficial to strengthening the connection between the government and the people. But at the same time, the proposal procedures should be explained to the representatives, requiring them to widely go deep into the masses to collect, so as to reflect the opinions of the masses to the representative meeting through the representatives. The benefits of doing this are:

1. After the proposals are studied and considered by the representatives, they can more centrally raise problems and propose specific implementation methods. This greatly improves the quality of the proposals, and some obviously unmanageable proposals (such as students asking to take the train for free), the representatives explain to them and explain the reasons, and after obtaining their consent, they will not propose them.

2. Representatives go deep into the masses to collect, and the proposals are more extensive.

3. The proposals are further strengthened through the representatives to strengthen the connection between the representatives and the masses.

    认真处理人民代表会议的提案
    保定市副市长  丁廷馨
    编者按：人民代表会议的提案，反映着人民的各种要求和他们对政府工作的各种意见。重视和认真处理人民的提案，是开好人民代表会议的一个主要环节。从本报已发表的有关政权建设的新闻和文章中，我们可以看出许多地方的人民政府对人民的提案是重视的，并认真负责地加以处理，因而进一步密切了人民政府与人民的联系，树立了人民代表会议在群众中的威信；但是也有许多地方的人民政府对人民的提案采取了敷衍了事的态度，在人民代表会议开会以前既不广泛地在群众中收集提案，开会期间对代表提出的提案也不严肃认真地加以处理，经过会议审查通过的提案也不及时办理，并向人民作交代。个别地方甚至干脆取消了提案审查委员会。结果许多地方的人民代表会议一次开得不如一次。今天本报所发表的河北省保定市处理提案的经验是很好的。各地人民政府应重视这一经验，参照改进对于人民提案的处理。
    认真处理人民代表会议的提案，是开好会议的重要内容之一。二年多以来，我们在这方面是有成绩的，但严格检查起来，还有不少缺点。从这一段实际工作体验中，下列几个问题，有提出研究之必要。
    一、提案的搜集，必须给代表充分的时间，深入群众，广泛发动。如此，广大群众的要求，才能反映到会议以上。代表对此也极为认真。综合保定市收集提案较好的方式，计有：
    （1）召集各界人民座谈会，在市民中多用此项办法。
    （2）按组织系统搜集，如工人按工会组织逐级提出，工商界以行业为单位讨论，教员学生动员全体师生分组开会讨论，提出提案。
    （3）代表分头到群众中搜集，然后共同研究提出。
    正因为代表搜集提案如此认真，因之绝大多数提案，反映了广大群众的迫切要求。如去年五月，正当工商业处于不景气之际，广大市民谋取生产生活门径也较困难。当时召开的人民代表会议，在二百六十四件提案中，提出解决市民生产者达三十三件，占全部提案百分之十二点七。同年十二月召开的人民代表会议，则以贯彻房租政策，大力修建房屋的提案占比重较大。
    二、提案的审查，必须严肃认真，案案有交代，组织包括各界代表参加的提案审查委员会，分组分类审查。初期审查意见多是笼统地提出“交政府参考”，或“交政府研究办理”。究竟是办是不办，交代不清。代表不同意这种审查办法，有的工人代表曾提出：“要怎么办，就说怎么办，只是笼统地提出，以后没法检查”。经不断改进，后来所提审查意见，尽量要求明确具体。能办者，即行提出交主管部门办理；不能办或缓办者，即说明不办与缓办理由。遇有某一提案，原意不明，或因了解的情况不够，不能肯定审查意见时，要和原提案人先行交换意见，反对敷衍了事，草率处理。
    三、提案审查后，用书面方式提交全体会议通过。我们曾采用大会逐条审查及先由小组讨论再到大会通过两种办法。经验证明，后一办法比前一办法既省时间，又使代表能够广泛发表意见。不过在小组讨论过程中往往因时间限制，小组审查比较草率，以致有时全体通过后，个别的却又提出不同意见。对此解决办法，在大会能迅速解决者，即在大会解决，倘如争论不休，则在会外由提案审查委员会与提不同意见的代表充分交换意见，趋于一致时再提到大会通过。
    四、提案一经通过，交到政府执行，能办的要抓紧时间迅速办理；不能办或缓办的，会后仍须向原提案人耐心解释；已办者要及时向代表交代。市人民政府虽对此进行过检查，但仍有不少缺点，这表现在：能办者有的办理不及时，存有拖延现象；已办者一般都是下次会议书面或口头报告，缺乏及时交代；不能办或缓办者未做到耐心解释，以致引起代表不满。个别提案，代表曾连续提出。
    五、提出提案的手续问题，原在代表会议通过的办法，是代表一人提议，另外一个代表附议。以后感觉这种作法不好，改为所有提案不管来自何方，只要是通过代表送来的一律接受，以示对人民意见的尊重。这对加强政府与人民联系上是有好处的。但同时应对代表说明提案手续，要求代表广泛地深入群众中去搜集，以便把群众意见通过代表反映到代表会。这样作的好处：
    1、提案经过代表研究考虑，能较集中地提出问题，且能提出具体的实施办法。这样大大提高了提案的质量，一些显然不能办的提案（如学生要求免费坐火车），代表对其进行解释，说明理由，经本人同意后，即不提出。
    2、代表深入群众搜集，提案广泛性更加增大。
    3、提案经过代表，进一步加强代表与群众的联系。
