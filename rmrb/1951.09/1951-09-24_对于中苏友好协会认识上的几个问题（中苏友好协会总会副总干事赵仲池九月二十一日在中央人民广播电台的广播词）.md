Comrades:

Today, I want to talk to you about several questions regarding the understanding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, especially concerning its nature and basic tasks.

The National Association of Sino-Soviet Friendship was established on October 5th two years ago. Before the establishment of the National Association, Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations had already been established in individual places such as Dalian and Harbin in the Northeast, but as a national mass organization, it only has two years of history. Over the past two years, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has greatly developed. Currently, all provinces in the country except Xikang and Tibet have formally established organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and individual places are actively preparing. In addition, about three-fifths of the counties across the country have also established organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, with more than 16 million members. Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda and education work is regularly carried out throughout the country. Therefore, I think everyone is familiar with this organization. However, some basic issues of this organization are still not well known to some people due to its short history. Here, I would like to introduce to you what kind of organization the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association basically is and what its main tasks are.

First, let’s talk about the nature of this organization.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in his report at the founding meeting of the National Association of Sino-Soviet Friendship that the purpose of establishing the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association "is to enhance and consolidate the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to promote the exchange of all wisdom and experience between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union." Obviously, enhancing and consolidating the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and promoting the exchange of all wisdom and experience between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, will inevitably greatly strengthen the strength of the world peace and democracy camp and benefit our country's construction in all aspects. Therefore, "Sino-Soviet friendship" reflects the will and requirements of all the Chinese people. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should be everyone's organization, the organization of all the Chinese people, not the organization of a few people. According to the resolution of the First National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, all Chinese people who enjoy civil rights, as long as they agree with the purpose of the association, are willing to promote Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from the Soviet Union, regardless of party affiliation, religious belief, and gender, can join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as members. From this, we can also see that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a very broad united front mass organization, including all democratic classes, all nationalities, and people with various beliefs in the Chinese people. It is not only the representatives of these people, but should be mass-based. All these people, as long as they are willing to promote Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from the Soviet Union, can join as members of this organization.

Second, then, what are the basic tasks of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association?

The resolution of the First National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association once pointed out that its basic task "is to educate the broad masses in the spirit of internationalism, enhance their understanding of the Soviet Union, and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union," that is to say, its daily main work is propaganda and education work for the broad masses. This propaganda and education work is based on Sino-Soviet friendship internationalism, and it widely introduces to our people the situation of the Soviet Union in politics, economy, culture, social life, and other aspects, and their rich knowledge and advanced experience in various aspects. Through these introductions, people will see a great and beautiful prospect, that is, the prospect of the highest ideal of human beings, the communist society. Therefore, this kind of propaganda and education for our people is also a vivid communist propaganda and education through concrete things.

This is a great and arduous task. In order to carry out this work, it is necessary to have a good understanding and study of the ideological situation of the people in various places regarding the above-mentioned issues, and it is necessary to seriously expose and refute the rumors and slanders of imperialism, the Kuomintang remnants, and all anti-Soviet sabotage elements against the Soviet Union and on the issue of Sino-Soviet friendship. We must not forget that imperialism, the Kuomintang remnants, and their lackeys are slandering the Soviet Union every day, sowing discord between the friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union. Because they know that if the Chinese people's understanding of the Soviet Union is improved and the friendly unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union is strengthened, the unity of the people of the world will have a stronger foundation, which will lead to the downfall of imperialism and its lackeys.

In addition, in order to carry out this great and arduous work, it is also necessary to strive to overcome the narrow nationalism that has been caused by the deception and incitement of the Kuomintang reactionaries among our people. Of course, the emergence of this narrow nationalism is related to the historical conditions in which our people have suffered from imperialist aggression for a long time in the past. But there is no doubt that some doubts and concerns about the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship arising from this will affect the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, which is incompatible with internationalism. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out systematic propaganda and explanation from the fundamental perspective of scientific socialism and the Soviet socialist system, combined with the thinking of the masses, in order to further consolidate and develop the friendship of the broad masses towards the Soviet Union.

Although our propaganda and education task is so huge, we should never just carry out some abstract, programmatic, or slogan-like propaganda and education to the masses, but should make full use of various propaganda tools in various forms, whether in written, oral, pictorial, or other artistic forms, so that the masses can accept it more easily, improve the masses step by step, and gradually solve the ideological problems of the broad masses.

Third, what I have said above is the nature and basic tasks of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. But up to now, these basic issues are still not fully known to everyone. Sometimes, it is occasionally encountered that some people are not clear about these issues, and some even have misunderstandings. This is partly because the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is a newly established organization and its history is not too long; on the other hand, it is also because the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association itself has not done enough propaganda and explanation on these issues. These vague understandings and misunderstandings usually encountered are as follows:

The first is insufficient understanding of the significance and tasks of this organization. They believe that since this organization is so broad, there is no difference between having it and not having it, joining it and not joining it. They often worry that there are already many organizations in the masses, and the masses often suffer from too many meetings, so they think that it is not necessary to establish this organization or not necessary to join this organization.

This understanding is wrong. The broad masses demand to participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association because its purpose and aim can and should represent the will and demands of the vast majority of our people. Therefore, its organizational members should never be limited to a few people or a few activists, as we have already discussed earlier. Secondly, it is also a fact that there are many organizations and many tasks in the masses, but it should be affirmed that the propaganda and education of Sino-Soviet friendship, understanding the Soviet Union, and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union are also indispensable tasks for our people. The problem is how to better carry out this propaganda and education work in this specific situation, that is, how to combine these propaganda and education tasks with the central tasks of various organizations at that time and place. The experience of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in many places has proved that adopting the policy of combining the central tasks of the local organizations to carry out the work can effectively carry out the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and at the same time greatly strengthen and promote the progress of the central tasks of the local organizations.

In addition to what has been said above, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should also make full use of the masses' spare time and rest time. This can also eliminate some of the above-mentioned concerns, because the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is carried out through various forms, including various cultural and artistic activities. Past experience has proved that films, pictures, picture albums, short plays, and other things related to Sino-Soviet friendship and introducing the Soviet Union are not only good things for the masses to learn Sino-Soviet friendship internationalism, but also good things for the masses' spare time activities and cultural entertainment activities. From the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various places, the masses are very welcome to these forms of propaganda and education. In this way, we can make full use of the masses' spare time and rest time to carry out work, so that the masses are educated unconsciously. Of course, in addition to these, some specialized activities and meetings related to Sino-Soviet friendship should also be held among the masses, but there should not be too many, too many will easily become a burden to the masses.

The second misunderstanding is that seeing the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as a united front organization, they think that this organization is mainly engaged in united front work. This is incorrect. According to this view, it is believed that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association does not have to become a mass organization, it only needs to recruit some representatives from all aspects, and the daily work only needs to do some upper-level liaison and communication activities. We say that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is of a united front nature, but its members are not just some upper-level figures, its organization must be mass-based, and its basic work must be the propaganda and education work of the masses.

The third misunderstanding is that seeing the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association mainly engaged in propaganda and education work and cultural and artistic activities, they think that this organization should mainly include some people engaged in propaganda, education, culture, and art work, who are intellectuals, and it is not necessary to absorb the broad masses of workers and peasants.

Yes, in today's China, people engaged in propaganda, education, culture, science, and art work are mainly intellectuals. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should absorb and unite these people well, and make them bear certain practical responsibilities, which is of great significance and should never be ignored. But it cannot be concluded from this that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should only include intellectuals. If this is the case, the work of people engaged in cultural, educational, scientific, and artistic work will also lose its place and object. This understanding is also completely contradictory to the mass nature of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association mentioned above.

The fourth is to misunderstand the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as an entertainment group, feeling that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is just a fun place. People who have this misunderstanding mostly see only on the surface that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association often organizes some cultural and artistic activities, and organizes some cultural welfare undertakings combined with their own work and business. Therefore, they have an incorrect understanding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and blur its nature and basic tasks. But on the other hand, we should also point out that the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in individual places lacks the necessary political content and the ideological nature is not enough. This shortcoming must be paid attention to and overcome. In addition, we should also note that this kind of propaganda and education work on Sino-Soviet friendship internationalism must be multi-faceted, avoiding the indiscriminate use of preaching methods regardless of the target, but must adopt appropriate forms for ideological and political work according to the level and specific ideological situation of the general masses, otherwise these work activities will not have greater significance.

Although these vague understandings and misunderstandings are not very common, they also have a certain representativeness. We should clarify these vague views and misunderstandings. More importantly, all Sino-Soviet friendship workers and all people who agree with Sino-Soviet friendship should think of more ways to positively and actively explain clearly to the broad masses some basic issues related to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, that is, the issue of the nature of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its basic tasks, so that the broad masses can participate in large numbers in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the cause of Sino-Soviet friendship.

    对于中苏友好协会认识上的几个问题
    （中苏友好协会总会副总干事赵仲池九月二十一日在中央人民广播电台的广播词）同志们：
    今天我想跟大家谈一谈对于中苏友好协会认识上的几个问题，特别是关于它的性质和基本任务的问题。
    中苏友好协会总会是在前年十月五号成立的。在总会成立以前，像东北的大连、哈尔滨个别地方已经建立了中苏友好协会组织，可是做为一个全国性的群众团体来说，还只有两年的历史。两年以来，中苏友好协会的工作有了很大的发展，目前全国各省除西康、西藏以外，都已正式建立了中苏友好协会的组织，个别地方正在积极筹备；此外全国大约有五分之三的县份也都建立了中苏友好协会的组织，会员已经有一千六百万人以上。全国各地经常进行着中苏友好的宣传教育工作。因此我想，大家对这个组织是熟悉的。但是对于这个组织的一些基本问题，因为历史短，有一些人还是不大知道的。这里就向大家介绍一下：中苏友好协会基本上是一个什么样的组织和什么是它的主要任务。
    第一，先讲一下这个组织的性质。
    刘少奇会长在中苏友好协会总会成立大会的报告里边说，成立中苏友好协会“其目的就是要增进与巩固中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和合作，促进中苏两大民族的一切智慧和经验的交流”。很明显的，增进与巩固中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和合作及促进中苏两大民族的一切智慧和经验的交流，就必然会大大的加强了世界和平民主阵营的力量和有利于我国各方面的建设。因此，“中苏友好”是反映了全中国人民的意志和要求的。因此，中苏友好协会，也就应该是大家的组织，全中国人民的组织，而不是某些少数人的组织。按照中苏友好协会第一次全国工作会议的决议所指出的，凡一切享有
    公民权的中国人民，只要他赞成本会宗旨，愿意增进中苏友好、学习苏联的，不分党派、宗教信仰和性别都可以参加中苏友好协会为会员。从此我们也可以看出：中苏友好协会是一个极广泛的统一战线的群众组织，包括中国人民中的各民主阶级，各民族，具有各种信仰的人们，也不仅是这些人们中的代表人物，而应当是群众性的。所有这些人们，只要愿意增进中苏友好、学习苏联，都可以参加为这个组织的成员。
    第二，那么，中苏友好协会的基本任务是什么呢？
    中苏友好协会第一次全国工作会议的决议中曾经指出，它的基本任务“是以国际主义的精神教育广大群众，增进他们对苏联的认识，学习苏联的先进经验”，也就是说，它日常的主要工作，是对广大群众的宣传教育工作。这种宣传教育工作，是以中苏友好国际主义为内容的，是向我国人民广泛地介绍苏联在政治、经济、文化、社会生活以及其他各方面的情况，和他们在各方面的丰富知识和先进经验的。通过这些介绍，会使人们看到一种伟大的美丽的远景，也就是人类最高理想的共产主义社会的远景。因此对我国人民的这种宣传教育，也是一种活的通过具体事物的共产主义的宣传教育。
    这是一项伟大而艰巨的工作。为了进行这个工作，就要很好地了解和研究各地人民群众对于前边所说的一些有关问题的思想情况，就必须针对帝国主义、国民党残余匪帮及一切反苏破坏分子对苏联和在中苏友好问题上的造谣诽谤，进行严肃的揭露驳斥工作。我们不能忘记，帝国主义、国民党残余匪帮和他的走狗却是天天在诽谤苏联，挑拨离间我们中苏两国人民的友好团结。因为他们知道，中国人民对苏联的认识提高了，中苏两国人民的友好团结加强了，就使得全世界人民的团结有了更强固的基础，这样就会使帝国主义和它的走狗们垮台。
    此外，为了要进行这项伟大而艰巨的工作，还必须努力克服在我国人民中间由于国民党反动派的欺骗煽惑所造成的狭隘民族主义思想。当然，所以产生这种狭隘民族主义思想，是和我国人民过去长期遭受到帝国主义侵略所处的历史条件有关的。但是毫无疑问的，因此而产生的一些对苏联和中苏友好的怀疑和顾虑，会影响到中苏两国人民的友好与合作，这是和国际主义不相容的。因此必须从科学社会主义的思想和苏联社会主义制度出发，结合着群众的思想，有系统地从根本上进行宣传解释，以便更加巩固和发展广大群众对苏联的友谊。
    我们的宣传教育任务虽然是这样巨大，但我们决不该因此就对群众只进行一些抽象的、纲领或口号式的宣传教育，而是要通过各种各样形式，充分使用各种宣传工具，不论是文字的、口头的、图片的以及其他各种艺术形式的，使群众更容易接受，一步一步地提高群众，才能逐步地解决广大群众中的思想问题。
    第三，上边我所讲的，就是中苏友好协会的性质和基本任务。但是到现在为止，这些基本问题还不是为大家所完全知道的。有时，倒是偶然可以碰到一些人们对这些问题还不大清楚，有的甚至还存在着误解。这种原因，一方面是由于中苏友好协会这个组织还是新成立的，历史并不太久；另一方面，也还由于中苏友好协会本身在这些问题上宣传解释的不够。这些模糊的认识和误解，通常碰到的有下边几种：
    第一种是对这个组织的意义和任务认识不足。他们认为这个组织既是这样广泛，那么有和没有，加入和不加入就没有什么区别了。他们往往顾虑现在群众中组织已经很多，群众往往苦于开会太多，于是便认为不一定要成立这个组织或不一定要加入这个组织了。
    这种认识是不对的。广大群众要求参加中苏友好协会，还是因为它的目的和宗旨，能够并且应当代表我国人民绝大多数的意志和要求。所以它的组织成员绝不应当限制在少数人当中或者限制在少数积极分子当中，这在前边我们已经谈过了。其次，群众中组织很多工作任务很多，这也是事实，但是应该肯定，中苏友好、认识苏联和学习苏联先进经验的宣传教育，也是我国人民不可少的任务。问题只是在这种具体情况下如何能更好地进行这种宣传教育工作，也就是如何使这些宣传教育任务和当时当地各个组织的中心任务结合的问题。许多地方中苏友好协会的经验已经证明，采取结合所在地所在组织的中心任务进行工作的方针，就很有效地进行了中苏友好协会的工作，同时也大大加强和推动了所在地所在组织的中心任务的进行。
    除了上边所谈的以外，中苏友好协会的工作还应当充分利用群众业余活动的时间和休息时间来进行。这样也可以消除前面所说的一些顾虑，因为中苏友好协会的工作是通过各种形式，包括各种文化艺术活动的形式来进行的。过去的经验已经证明：有关中苏友好介绍苏联的电影、图片、画报、短剧以及其他等等，不但是群众学习中苏友好国际主义的很好的东西，而且也是群众业余活动文化娱乐活动中很好的东西，从各地中苏友好协会的工作中看，群众是非常欢迎这些宣传教育形式的。这样我们便可以充分利用群众业余活动时间和休息时间进行工作，使群众不知不觉地受到教育。当然除了这些以外，在群众中一些专门性的有关中苏友好的活动、会议等等也应该有，但是不应当过多，过多了就容易成为群众的一个负担。
    第二种误解是看到中苏友好协会是一个统一战线的组织，就以为这个组织主要是进行统一战线工作。这是不正确的。根据这样的看法，认为中苏友好协会就可以不必成为群众性的组织，只罗致些各方面的代表人物，而日常工作只做些上层联络交际活动就够了。我们说，中苏友好协会是统一战线性质的，但它的成员不只是一些上层人物，它的组织必须是群众性的，它的基本工作必须是群众的宣传教育工作。
    第三种误解是看到了中苏友好协会主要是进行宣传教育工作和文化艺术活动，就认为这个组织里面主要应当包括一些从事宣传教育文化艺术工作的人们，是知识分子，而不必吸收广大工农劳动人民了。
    是的，在现在的中国，从事宣传教育文化科学艺术工作的人们主要是知识分子出身的，中苏友好协会应当很好的吸收团结这些人，并且使他们负担一定的实际责任，这是有很大意义的，绝不应当忽视。但也不能因此就得出结论说中苏友好协会只应当包括知识分子。如果这样，从事文化教育科学艺术工作的人们的工作也便失去了场所和对象。这种认识和上边说的中苏友好协会的群众性也是完全抵触的。
    第四种是把中苏友好协会误解成一个娱乐性的团体，觉得中苏友好协会只是一个好玩的地方。有这种误解的人，多半是只从表面上看到中苏友好协会经常办一些文艺活动，举办一些与自己的工作和业务结合的文化性的福利事业。因此就对中苏友好协会发生一种不正确的了解，而把它的性质和基本任务模糊起来。但另一方面我们也应该指出来的，就是个别地方的中苏友好协会的工作缺少必要的政治内容，思想性还不够。这个缺点是必须注意克服的。另外我们也还要注意到，就是这种中苏友好国际主义的宣传教育工作必须是多方面的，避免不看对象千篇一律地用说教方式来进行工作，而必须根据一般群众的水平和具体思想情况采用适当的形式进行思想、政治工作，不然这些工作活动也就没有更大的意义了。
    以上这些模糊的认识和误解虽然不是很普遍的，但也有它一定的代表性。我们应当澄清这些模糊的看法和误解，更重要的是一切中苏友好工作者和一切赞成中苏友好的人们，更多想办法从正面积极地向广大群众解释清楚有关中苏友好协会的一些基本问题，就是关于中苏友好协会的性质和它的基本任务的问题，使广大群众大量地参加到中苏友好协会和中苏友好的事业中来。（新华社）
