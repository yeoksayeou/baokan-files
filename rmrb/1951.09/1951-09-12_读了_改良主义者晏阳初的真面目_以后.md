Reader's Letters

	After reading “‘Reformer’ James Yen's True Colors”
	To the Editor:
	After reading Mr. Xiao Ma's letter "'Reformer' James Yen's True Colors" published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on September 3, I thoroughly recognized the reactionary nature of James Yen and the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement (hereinafter referred to as the Mass Education Movement) he founded, clarifying more than 20 years of confused thinking.
	As early as 1929, I was influenced by James Yen's four major educations (literature and art, livelihood, health, and citizenship) theory and two major goals (eliminating illiteracy, creating new citizens), and founded the "Zhuoxian Mass Education Promotion Association." I worked hard for eight years until the Lugouqiao Incident in 1937 when the county seat fell and I reluctantly gave up. At that time, I also wrote a summary of more than 20,000 words - "Experience Talk on Mass Education in the Past Eight Years," which was published in the "Education Magazine" of the Commercial Press at that time. During these eight years, I did a lot and saw a lot (visited Dingxian). In the end, what did I get? The broad masses of working people still lived in suffering. We spent a lot of manpower and material resources, but it was like throwing stones into the sea, only causing a little ripple on the surface, and the result was "drawing water with a bamboo basket, all in vain."
	The people of the Mass Education Movement fled to Changsha, and after the Changsha fire, they moved to Chongqing, engaging in rural construction and so-called experimental zones. This long period of time turned my hair gray and my illusions disappeared. I went from believing in the theory of the Mass Education Movement to wavering and finally negating it.
	Without revolutionary means to change social relations, attempting to transform society with the power of "education" on the basis of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society is truly foolish and ridiculous. This idealistic and confused theory deceived me for a long time. Now I finally understand!
	In the past, I was also extremely vague about James Yen's reactionary nature of clinging to imperialism. I knew that James Yen often ran to the United States, supposedly to "raise funds" for the Mass Education Movement. The Mass Education Movement has always relied on US dollars to survive; without "fundraising," it could not survive. In Dingxian, he often boasted about this, saying that "the Mass Education Movement does not rely on any warlords, neither Cao Kun's, Zhang Zuolin's money, nor Chiang Kai-shek's money," as if he were very "noble." In fact, he had already completely leaned towards Chiang Kai-shek's embrace and became a running dog of US imperialism. The fact is very clear: without leaning towards Chiang Kai-shek, the Mass Education Movement could not hang its signboard; without being a running dog of US imperialism, Wall Street bosses would not be "generous."
	In the past, I did not understand these things. On the contrary, I thought that James Yen had not become a high-ranking Kuomintang official for decades (in fact, he had also served as a senator) and had always devoted himself to mass education, being an "educational expert with integrity and ambition." At the same time, I admired those American "philanthropists" who were "generous" and "benevolent." Now, this "magic lantern" is completely dismantled. The US imperialists "donated money" to James Yen precisely to use the beautiful cloak of "mass education" in an attempt to paralyze the Chinese people and maintain the reactionary regime of its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang. This is one of the old tricks of US imperialism in invading China, and it is also a concrete manifestation of the collusion between imperialism and feudalism. James Yen just acted as this "broker" and "running dog." After liberation, he still hid in the United States as a "broker" and "running dog" who did evil to the end, continuing his anti-people cause. This makes people see his reactionary nature even more clearly.

### 读了“‘改良主义者’晏阳初的真面目”以后

专栏：读者来信

    读了“‘改良主义者’晏阳初的真面目”以后编辑同志：
    九月三日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了萧马先生“‘改良主义者’晏阳初的真面目”的信件，读了之后，我澈底认识了晏阳初和他所办的中华平民教育促进会（以下简称平教会）的反动本质，澄清了积累二十多年的糊涂思想。
    远在一九二九年，我就受到晏阳初的四大教育（文艺、生计、卫生、公民）理论和两大目标（除文盲、作新民）的影响，并且创设了“涿县平民教育促进会”。我一气干了八年，直到一九三七年芦沟桥一声炮响，县城沦陷，才忍痛地放下手。那时，我还写了一篇两万多字的总结——“八年来民众教育经验谈”，在当时商务印书馆的“教育杂志”上发表。这八年中，自己作得不算少，看得也不算少
    （到定县参观）。归根到底，得到了什么？广大的劳动人民仍旧生活在苦难中。我们费了不少的人力物力，但好像在大海里抛石子一样，仅仅在水面上起了一点点的小波动，结果是“竹篮打水一场空”。
    平教会的人逃到长沙，长沙大火，又迁到重庆，搞起了乡村建设和什么实验区等等。这漫长的时间，使我头发斑白了，幻想消失了。对平教会的理论，由相信而动摇，终于否定。
    不用革命手段来改变社会关系，妄图在半封建半殖民地社会的基础上以“教育”力量来改造社会，那真是太愚蠢可笑了。这种唯心的糊涂理论，欺骗了我很长时间。我现在才恍然大悟了！
    对晏阳初依附帝国主义的反动本质，我在过去也是极其模糊的。知道晏阳初常常跑美国，据说是为平教会“募捐”。平教会向来是靠美金生活的，不“募捐”便不能生存。在定县的时候，他常以此自豪，说什么“平教会不依靠任何军阀，既不要曹锟、张作霖的钱，也不要蒋介石的钱”，好像是很“清高”似的。实际上他早已不折不扣地倒向蒋介石的怀抱，作了美帝国主义的走狗。事实很明白：不倒向蒋介石，平教会便不能挂招牌；不作美帝国主义的走狗，华尔街老板便不会“慷慨解囊”的。
    过去，我理解不到这些。反认为晏阳初几十年没作国民党的大官（实际他已兼了参政员），始终致力平民教育，是个“有气节有事业心的教育专家”。同时也钦佩美国那些“仗义疏财”、“乐善好施”的“慈善家”。现在，这“西洋镜”完全拆穿了。美帝国主义者“捐钱”给晏阳初，正是利用“平民教育”美丽的外衣，企图来麻醉中国人民，维持它的走狗蒋介石匪帮的反动政权。这是美帝国主义侵略中国故技之一，也是帝国主义与封建主义互相勾结的具体内容之一，晏阳初恰好作了这一名“掮客”“走狗”。解放后，他仍躲在美国作一名作恶到底的“掮客”“走狗”，继续进行其反人民的事业。这就使人更清楚地看出他的反动本质。    张学铭
