    Written to the Patriots of New China
    Soviet Hero A. Malexiyev

    Editor's Note: This is an article written by Soviet hero A. Malexiyev to celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of our country. A. Malexiyev is the protagonist of the famous Soviet novel "A Real Man" and the movie "Steel Will," which are widely circulated in our country. His strong, resolute fighting spirit and heroic achievements in the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union have long been extolled by the Chinese people. In this article, he expresses his infinite love for New China and gives Chinese people and Chinese youth enthusiastic fighting encouragement.

    On the great National Day of the Chinese people, I would like to extend warm congratulations to all my Chinese friends.

    The working people of the People's Republic of China, having taken their destiny into their own hands, are building a happy new life. Like the Soviet people, they are staunch supporters of peace and friendship among all nations. The signatures of over 344 million Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals on the declaration supporting the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers demonstrate this. This is also evidenced by a letter I recently received from a Chinese youth, Xie Yanwei (transliteration), a student at Yali Middle School in Changsha, Hunan Province.

    Xie Yanwei wrote in his letter: "We decided that everyone should write letters to our international friends, to those who are fighting for peace. This matter has ignited like a flame in our school, and our classmates are writing letters to Asia, Africa, the Americas, Europe, and the Pacific countries. I learned about your name from Polevoi's novel 'A Real Man,' so I am writing to you today."

    What makes me feel most gratified in this letter is that this young Chinese friend speaks to me as if to a soldier in the army of peace, a fighter for peace.

    People in every corner of the world understand that we, the Soviet people, have the strength to defend our sacred land and the great achievements of the October Socialist Revolution, and no imperialist robber can intimidate us. And we ourselves are a people of free and peaceful labor. We are engaged in communist construction, and we have many pleasant creative undertakings. The great Stalin teaches us to be staunch supporters of peace. That is why I stood on the podium of the First World Peace Congress held in Paris in April 1949, representing Soviet youth, calling on all kind people to use all their strength and means to defend peace. That is why, as a participant in the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw in November 1950, I made the same call at mass rallies in the cities of New Democratic Poland.

    Why do the Chinese working people need peace? The Chinese youth Xie Yanwei answered this question.

    Xie Yanwei wrote: "The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique colluded with the American and British imperialists to oppress the people. Under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime, we lived a miserable life, living like beasts of burden, with nowhere to complain. Only after the People's Liberation Army liberated Changsha were we able to breathe freely. We now have our own people's country and our own people's government. We eagerly look forward to peace, because only with peaceful construction can we improve our living standards and heal the wounds of war."

    The Soviet people understand the Chinese working people's desire for peace very well. We are very pleased with the achievements of the Chinese people in developing their country's economy and culture. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in just two years, the Chinese working people, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, have made remarkable achievements in building their new democratic country. The dreams of the Chinese workers are being realized, and great undertakings unprecedented in Chinese history are being accomplished.

    In the People's Republic of China, factories and mines that were previously destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits have now been restored. We receive this news with great joy. Enterprises in the hands of Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists have now become the property of the people and are serving to improve the well-being of all working people. The pride of Chinese patriots when talking about the achievements of their truly people's country is familiar and understandable to me, a Soviet person. I understand the feelings of another student from Yali Middle School in Changsha, Liu Xuehua (transliteration), who affectionately reported to me in his letter:

    "Our construction undertakings are developing by leaps and bounds. For example, the power plant in the city where I live, without any changes in equipment, is supplying five times more electricity than before liberation. The Yellow River has harmed the people for thousands of years, but now we have repaired its embankments."

    Dear Liu Xuehua, I am happy with you for all these achievements. The achievements of the Chinese peasants, who obtained the land they had dreamed of for many years from the People's Government, are great. Chinese peasants are no longer slaves of landlords and rich peasants! Only a People's Government that understands the urgent needs and hopes of the broad masses of working people can launch extensive irrigation work throughout the country and begin implementing a massive plan to increase yields and fight floods.

    The People's Government has opened up broad avenues for the Chinese working people to approach knowledge, science, and art. Primary and secondary schools, secondary technical schools, and higher vocational schools are being increased everywhere, creating conditions for all Chinese children and young people to have the opportunity to study. You, the students of Yali Middle School in Changsha, also feel the great concern of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party for the development of education every day.

    Live and learn. The great leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, have more than once called on workers and peasants to study, constantly enrich themselves, and broaden their horizons.

    The desire to learn and the desire to constantly enrich oneself have become national characteristics of the Soviet people. For example, I used to be an Air Force pilot, but now I am sitting at my desk again. I am now a third-year student at the Higher Party School. We know that in New China, more and more adults are also demanding to study, and now there are millions of workers and staff members studying in adult schools in their spare time alone.

    From the letters of my Chinese friends, I also feel that none of them will forget the conspiracies of the American and British imperialists, the instigators of a third world war, who have already massacred large numbers of Korean women, old people and children.

    Xie Yanwei wrote to me in his letter: "American imperialists have ignited the flames of war in Korea and are trying to extend it to the borders of China. The aggressors must be met with a powerful blow."

    Chinese patriots correctly believe that helping the Korean people fight against American and British interventionists is also defending the borders of New China. "Resist America, Aid Korea!" That's what the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers are saying.

    The feelings of being closely linked to the fraternal Korean people, the love for the motherland, the irreconcilable hatred for the enemy, and the great aspiration to defend peace have led the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean battlefield.

    "I have firmly and unequivocally decided to participate in the national defense construction of our country and step onto the glorious post of defending our homeland." My friend Liu Xuehua, these words of yours particularly moved me. Allow me, a person who deeply understands the sacred responsibility of defending the motherland, to wish you the courage and perseverance to overcome all difficulties and never give up. Allow me to shake your hand tightly, the hand of thousands upon thousands of patriots of free New China like you and Xie Yanwei. (Attached picture)

### 写给新中国的爱国者

专栏：

    写给新中国的爱国者 
    苏联英雄  阿·马列西耶夫
    编者按：这是苏联英雄阿·马列西耶夫为庆祝我国建国二周年而写的文章。阿·马列西耶夫是在我国广泛流传的苏联著名小说“真正的人”和电影“钢铁意志”的主人公。他在伟大的苏联卫国战争中所表现的坚强刚毅的战斗精神和英雄业迹早已为我国人民所传诵。在这篇文章里，他表示了对新中国的无限热爱并给中国人民和中国青年以热情的战斗鼓舞。
    在中国人民的伟大的国庆日，我愿向我所有的中国朋友们，致以热烈的祝贺。
    中华人民共和国的劳动人民，已经把自己的命运掌握在自己手里，正建设着幸福的新生活，他们同苏维埃人一样，是各民族和平友好的坚定不移的拥护者。三亿四千四百余万中国工人、农民、劳动知识分子在拥护五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上的签名，说明了这一点。不久以前我接到的中国青年谢延维（译音）寄给我的信，证明了这一点，他是湖南省长沙市雅礼中学的学生。
    谢延维信里写道：“我们决定每个人都要写信给我们的国际朋友，给那些为争取和平而斗争的人们。这件事情在我们学校里就像火焰一般地燃烧起来，我们同学们向亚洲、非洲、美洲、欧洲和太平洋各国写信。我从波列伏依的小说“真正的人”里知道了您的名字，所以在今天写信给您。”
    在这封信里，最使我感觉快慰的是这位中国的青年朋友对我讲话，就像对待一个和平军队的士兵、对待一个为和平而斗争的战士一样。
    全世界每个角落的人们都很明白：我们苏联人民是有力量保卫自己的神圣的土地和十月社会主义革命的伟大成就的，任何帝国主义强盗都吓不倒我们。而我们自己则是自由的和平劳动的人民。我们正在从事共产主义建设，我们有着许多令人愉快的创造性的事业。伟大的斯大林教导我们：要成为始终不渝的和平拥护者。这就是为什么我要在一九四九年四月巴黎举行的第一届世界和平大会的主席台上，代表苏维埃青年，呼吁一切善良的人们用一切力量和方法来保卫和平的原因。这就是为什么我在一九五○年十一月，作为在华沙举行的第二届世界和平大会的参加者，在新民主主义的波兰各城市中的群众大会上发出同样的呼吁的原因。
    为什么中国劳动人民需要和平呢？中国青年谢延维答复了这个问题。
    谢延维写道：“蒋介石反动集团和美英帝国主义者勾结起来压迫人民。在蒋介石反动政权的统治下，我们过着悲惨的日子，过着牛马一样的生活，而无处诉苦。直到人民解放军解放长沙，我们才能够自由地呼吸了。我们现在有着自己的人民国家和自己的人民政府。我们热烈盼望和平，因为只有和平建设，才能提高我们的生活水平，才能治愈战争带来的创伤。”
    苏联人民很了解中国劳动人民对于和平的渴望。中国人民在发展自己国家的经济和文化中的成就，使我们感到非常喜欢。自中华人民共和国成立以来，两年光景，中国劳动人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，已经在建设自己的新民主主义的国家中，获得了卓越的成就。中国的劳动者的梦想在实现着，中国历史上空前未有的伟大事业在完成着。
    在中华人民共和国，以前被日本侵略者和国民党匪帮破坏了的工厂和矿坑，现在都已经恢复了。这项报道，我们是怀着巨大的喜悦来接受的。掌握在国民党官僚资本手中的企业，现在变成了人民的财产，并且正在为提高全体劳动人民的幸福而服务。中国的爱国者在谈到自己的真正人民的国家的成就时的自豪心情，对于我，一个苏维埃人，是亲切的，是可以理解的。我了解长沙雅礼中学的另一个学生刘雪华（译音）的感情，他在给我的信中向我亲切地报道说：
    “我们的建设事业正在突飞猛进地发展着。例如，我所居住的城市里的发电厂，在设备没有任何变更的情况之下，比解放前多供应了五倍的电力。黄河千年来为害人民，现在我们培修了它的堤岸。”
    亲爱的刘雪华，我和你一起为这所有的成就而高兴。中国农民，从人民政府手里取得了多年梦想的土地，他们的成就是伟大的。中国农民再也不是地主和富农的奴隶了！只有理解广大劳动大众的迫切需要和希望的人民政府，才能在全国展开广泛的灌溉工作，开始实行提高收获率和与水灾进行斗争的巨大计划。
    人民政府为中国的劳动人民打开了接近知识、科学和艺术的广阔道路。到处都在增设中小学校、中等技术学校和高等专科学校，使中国所有儿童、青年都能够有学习的条件，正在创设着。你们，长沙雅礼中学的学生们，也日常感觉到人民政府和中国共产党对于发展教育的巨大关怀。
    活到老，要学到老。劳动人民的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林不止一次地号召工人和农民学习，经常地充实自己，扩大自己的视野。
    渴望学习，渴望经常地充实自己，已变成了苏联人民的民族特点。譬如我过去是空军驾驶员，可是现在又重新坐在书桌旁了，我现在是最高党校三年级的学员。我们知道，在新中国也有愈来愈多的成年人民要求学习，而现在仅在业余时间学习的成年人学校中，便有数百万职工在学习。
    从我的中国朋友们的来信里，我也感觉到，他们中间没有一个人会忘记美英帝国主义者、第三次世界大战挑拨者们底阴谋，这些家伙已经大批地屠杀了朝鲜妇女、老人和孩子。
    谢延维写给我的信中说：“美帝国主义者在朝鲜燃起了战火，并企图把它延烧到中国的国境上来，对于侵略者是永远需要报以有力的打击的。”
    中国的爱国者正确地认为：帮助朝鲜人民与美英干涉者进行斗争，同时也就是保卫新中国的国境。“抗美援朝！”中国人民志愿军的战士们都这么说。
    与兄弟般的朝鲜人民休戚相关的感情，对于祖国的热爱、对于敌人的不共戴天的仇恨，以及保卫和平的宏愿，使中国人民志愿走上了朝鲜战场。
    “我已经坚决地、毫无疑虑地决定参加我国的国防建设，踏上保家卫国的光荣岗位。”我的朋友刘雪华，你的这几句话，使我特别激动。允许我，一个深知保卫祖国这种神圣责任的人，祝你有不畏一切艰难、百折不回的勇敢和刚毅的精神。允许我紧握你的手，紧握成千成万像你和谢延维一样的、自由新中国的爱国者的手。（附图片）
