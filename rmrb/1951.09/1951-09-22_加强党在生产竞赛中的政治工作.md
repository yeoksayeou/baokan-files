    Strengthening Political Work of the Party in Production Competitions

    In state-owned enterprises, many factories and mines have paid attention to the Party's political work, educating workers to actively participate in production competitions, giving play to production enthusiasm, and improving production efficiency. However, some factories and mines have neglected the Party's political work, simply using material rewards to stimulate workers' production enthusiasm. Baoxing Coal Mine in Xuanhua City, Chahar Province, made such mistakes when carrying out the Red Flag competition. As a result, although the mine once improved the enthusiasm of the workers and staff and some model production groups emerged, its foundation was based on the pursuit of bonuses. Therefore, after the bonuses were distributed, the production competition stagnated. Even, due to the unreasonable method of giving rewards, it caused some disunity among the workers. Later, although the mine made a review of this, it still did not pay attention to strengthening the Party's political work.

    Jiawang Coal Mine in Shandong also made such mistakes. When the mine arranged this year's production tasks and responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang team, it did not pay attention to guiding workers to learn the characteristics of the Ma Hengchang team in breaking technological conservatism, eliminating the remnants of guildism, etc., but proposed: creating a record of 100 tons of coal mining with wind picks, a star steel pen as a bonus; 150 tons, a swimming watch as a bonus; 200 tons, a ten-tube radio as a bonus. Once this simple material reward method was proposed, the cadres below had many opinions and focused their attention on calculating the prizes. As a result, the income from increased production was not enough to cover the expenses of the prizes.

    It is undeniable that correct material rewards are one of the methods to promote production competitions; but this must be carried out on the basis of the Party's political work in order to effectively develop and consolidate the workers' production enthusiasm and creativity. Therefore, workers should be educated to understand the consistency of improving production efficiency with the interests of the working class. Only when workers create higher production records and create more wealth for the country can the workers' material life be improved day by day along with the country's prosperity. Therefore, simple material rewards are wrong, because this not only cannot improve the workers' class consciousness, but also promotes the economism of some backward workers.

    All factories and mines must strengthen the Party's political work in production competitions, and base material rewards on the Party's political work in order to improve the production enthusiasm and political awareness of workers and staff.

### 加强党在生产竞赛中的政治工作

    加强党在生产竞赛中的政治工作
    在国营企业中，有不少的厂矿注意了党的政治工作，教育工人积极参加了生产竞赛，发挥了生产积极性，提高了生产效率。但有部分厂矿忽视党的政治工作，单纯使用物质奖励的方法刺激工人的生产情绪。察哈尔宣化市宝兴煤矿就曾在开展红旗竞赛时，发生过这样的错误。结果该矿虽曾一度提高了职工的劳动热情，并且出现了一些生产模范小组；但其基础却是建立在追求奖金上，因而在发奖以后，生产竞赛就停滞下来了。甚至因给奖的方法不合理，还造成了工人间的某些不团结现象。后来该矿虽然对此作了检查，但仍没有注意加强党的政治工作。
    山东贾汪煤矿也曾发生过这样的错误。该矿在布置今年生产任务及向马恒昌小组应战时，不注意引导工人学习马恒昌小组打破技术保守观念，肃清行会主义思想残余等等的特色，而提出：风镐采煤创一百吨纪录，奖金星钢笔一枝，一百五十吨奖游泳表一只，二百吨奖十个灯的收音机一架。这种单纯物质奖励的办法一经提出，下面干部意见纷纷，把注意力集中在计较奖品上面去了。结果，增产的收入，还不够奖品的开支。
    不可否认，正确地进行物质奖励，是推动生产竞赛的方法之一；但这必须是在党的政治工作的基础上来进行，才能有效地发挥和巩固工人的生产积极性和创造性。因此，应该教育工人懂得生产效率的提高与工人阶级的利益的一致性，只有工人们创造更高的生产纪录，为国家创造更多的财富，工人的物质生活才能随着国家的富强而日益改善。所以单纯的物质奖励是不对的，因为这不仅不能提高工人的阶级觉悟，反而助长了部分落后职工的经济主义观点。
    所有厂矿企业在生产竞赛中，均必须加强党的政治工作，把物质奖励建立在党的政治工作的基础上，以提高职工的生产热情与政治觉悟。
