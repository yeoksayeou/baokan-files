    A Happy Holiday for Progressive Humanity Worldwide
    Soviet Stalin Prize Winner, Engineer Fedor Kovalev
    Editor's Note: This is a letter from Fedor Kovalev, a Soviet Stalin Prize winner and engineer at the Moscow "Proletarian Victory" factory, congratulating China on its National Day. Kovalev's name is well-known to the Chinese people, especially Chinese workers, because the "Kovalev Work Method" he created has been promoted in many factories in China, increasing the productivity of Chinese workers several times over. Dear friends!
    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me to extend my warm greetings to you and wish you the greatest achievements in the construction of a new life. The glorious second anniversary is not only a happy holiday for the Chinese people, but also a happy holiday for progressive humanity worldwide.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution dealt a devastating blow to the imperialist aggressive camp and increased the strength of peace, democracy, and socialism. New China is the great guardian of peace and independence for the nations of the East and a loyal ally of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    The Soviet people are paying close attention to the peaceful development of the People's Republic of China, which has achieved great success under the leadership of the Communist Party and its long-tested leader, Mao Zedong. The face of old China is rapidly disappearing. What is being built and firmly established in its place is a new people's China, a new democratic system and laws, which have liberated the ordinary people.
    The Soviet people are excited about every victory of the Chinese working people in the cause of national democratic reform, and they will always be willing to give the Chinese people—the great warriors defending world peace—any help for their happiness.
    Dear friends! Hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world support the Soviet Union's policy of peace and are engaged in an indomitable struggle to establish lasting world peace. Honest people around the world are filled with a firm determination to crush the vile plans of the warmongers who are trying to launch a bloody massacre in Europe and the Far East. Soviet-Chinese friendship is a powerful force for ensuring peace in the Far East. This friendship is also of great significance for maintaining world peace.
    The Chinese people have made a firm vow to defend peace. More than 344 million people have signed the World Peace Council's declaration in support of the Five-Power Peace Pact.
    The Soviet people are waging a heroic and indomitable struggle for the conclusion of a peace pact. National conferences of peace supporters are currently being held throughout our country. Soviet workers, peasants, intellectuals, and young men and women unanimously support the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact. The textile workers of the "Proletarian Victory" factory also welcomed this historic document with joy and excitement.
    "Peace will surely triumph over war!" "Consolidate peace with all our strength!"—they declared in response to the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact.
    The textile workers in our factory, like the workers in other enterprises, are increasing the output of their products day by day in the struggle to defend peace. "To give the motherland more textiles is our contribution to the cause of defending world peace," everyone says.
    Our factory is the pioneer in scientifically summarizing and promoting the Stakhanovite method of labor (i.e., what our workers usually call the "Kovalev Work Method"—Xinhua News Agency note). Now all our shifts and workshops are working according to the Stakhanovite method. Every worker is absorbing the experience of outstanding producers and using it on their own machines.
    The collective Stakhanovite method of labor enables our factory to continuously increase productivity and overfulfill production plans. The output of textiles is constantly increasing. In July of this year, we supplied the state with 21 percent more finished fabrics than in July 1950. Labor productivity in textiles increased by 14.5 percent during the same period.
    At the beginning of 1951, when the workers embarked on the Stakhanovite peace work shift, they agreed to complete the annual plan on December 27. Now, after discovering new production reserves, they have revised this deadline and decided to set the date for the completion of the annual plan on December 17.
    The method of scientifically summarizing and promoting the Stakhanovite method of labor, which originated in the "Proletarian Victory" factory, has been widely applied in all industrial sectors and has achieved tremendous economic results. Today, there is no factory in the Soviet Union that is not using this method. We would be extremely pleased if this method could achieve such widespread application and produce outstanding results in your industry as well.
    Dear friends! The great standard-bearer of peace, the leader of the working people of the world, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, wrote in his reply to Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan:
    "The Chinese people and their Liberation Army, regardless of the conspiracies of the Kuomintang, played a tremendous role in eliminating the Japanese imperialists. The struggle of the Chinese people and their Liberation Army greatly facilitated the task of defeating the Japanese aggressor forces.
    There is no doubt that the indestructible friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is now and will continue to be for the cause of ensuring peace in the Far East and opposing all aggressors and warmongers."
    Let us further consolidate our friendship—the guarantee of world peace.
    A fraternal salute to the great Chinese people on the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the government of the Chinese people and Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great warrior for world peace!

    全世界进步人类快乐的节日
    苏联斯大林奖金获得者工程师  费道尔·郭瓦廖夫
    编者按：这是苏联斯大林奖金获得者莫斯科“无产阶级胜利”工厂的工程师费道尔·郭瓦廖夫祝贺我国国庆的来信。郭瓦廖夫的名字已为我国人民特别是我国工人所熟识，因为他所创造的“郭瓦廖夫工作方法”，已在我国许多工厂里推广着，并且在推广中使我国工人的生产效率提高了数倍。亲爱的朋友们！
    在中华人民共和国成立二周年之际，请允许我向你们致热烈的敬礼，并祝贺你们在新生活建设中获得最大的成就。光荣的二周年纪念不但是中国人民快乐的节日，也是全世界进步人类快乐的节日。
    中国革命的胜利，给了帝国主义侵略阵营一个毁灭性的打击，增加了和平、民主和社会主义的力量。新中国是东方各民族和平与独立的伟大守护者，是苏联和人民民主国家的忠实的盟友。
    苏联人民对于中华人民共和国的和平发展给与极密切的注意，这个国家在共产党及其久经考验的领袖毛泽东的领导之下获得了巨大的成就。旧中国的面貌正在迅速地消灭。代之而起和牢不可破地树立起来的，是新的人民的中国和新的民主制度和法律，这些制度和法律已经把普通人民解放出来了。
    苏联人民为中国劳动人民在国家民主改革事业中的每一个胜利而兴奋，他们永远愿为中国人民——保卫世界和平的伟大战士——的幸福而给与他们任何帮助。
    亲爱的朋友们！全世界千百万普通人民都拥护苏联的和平政策，而为建立世界持久和平进行着百折不挠的斗争。全世界正直人们充满了坚强的决心，一定要粉碎妄图发动欧洲和远东的血腥大屠杀的战争贩子的卑污计划。对于保障远东和平，苏中友谊是一个强大的力量。这个友谊对于维护世界和平也有极大的意义。
    中国人民已经为保卫和平作了坚定的誓约。三亿四千四百余万人已经在拥护五大国缔结和平公约的世界和平理事会的宣言上签了名。
    苏联人民正为缔结和平公约进行着坚苦卓绝和百折不挠的斗争。在我们全国，现在正召开拥护和平的代表会议。苏联工人、农民、知识分子和男女青年一致拥护世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言。“无产阶级胜利”工厂的纺织工人也以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接了这个历史性的文献。
    “和平一定战胜战争！”“用一切力量巩固和平！”——他们在响应缔结和平公约的宣言时这样宣称。
    我厂纺织工人也像其他企业的工人一样，在拥护和平的斗争中逐日增加生产品的产量。“给祖国更多的纺织品，就是我们对于保卫世界和平事业的贡献”——每一个工人都这样说。
    我厂是科学地概括和推广斯达哈诺夫劳动方式的方法（即我国工人通常所说的“郭瓦廖夫工作方法”——新华社注）的首创者。我们现在各班、各个车间都按照斯达哈诺夫的方式在劳动。每一个工人都在吸收优秀生产者的经验，并在自己的车床上利用这些经验。
    集体斯达哈诺夫劳动方法使我们工厂能够不断地提高生产率，超额完成生产计划。纺织物产量不断地增加。今年七月我们供给国家的成品织物比一九五零年七月增加了百分之二十一。纺织方面的劳动生产率在同一时期增加了百分之十四点五。
    一九五一年初，工人走上斯达哈诺夫和平工作班的时候，曾经约定要在十二月二十七日完成全年计划。现在他们发现了新的生产后备力之后，就修改了这期限，决定把全年计划完成的日子定为十二月十七日。
    诞生在“无产阶级胜利”工厂的科学概括和推广斯达哈诺夫劳动方式的方法，已经在一切工业部门里广泛应用，并获得了巨大的经济效果。如今苏联已经没有一个工厂不在利用这种方法了。如果这种方法在你们工业中也能获得这样普遍的应用和产生卓越的成果，我们将引为极大的欣慰。
    亲爱的朋友们！伟大的和平旗手、全世界劳动人民的领袖约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇·斯大林在抗日战争胜利六周年之际给中国人民领袖毛泽东的复电中写道：
    “中国人民及其解放军不顾国民党的阴谋，在消灭日本帝国主义者的事业中起了巨大的作用。中国人民及其解放军的斗争，大大地便利了击溃日本侵略力量的事业。
    无庸置疑，苏联和中华人民共和国的不可摧毁的友谊，在现在和将来都是为着保证远东和平，反对一切侵略者及战争贩子的事业的。”
    让我们进一步巩固我们的友谊——世界和平的保证。
    在中华人民共和国成立二周年纪念日向伟大的中国人民致兄弟的敬礼！
    中国人民的政府和中国人民的领袖毛泽东万岁！
    世界和平的伟大战士约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇·斯大林万岁！		斯大林奖金获得者工程师  费道尔·郭瓦廖夫（附图片）
