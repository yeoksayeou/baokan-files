The Miao people of Baiyun District, Sanjiang County, Guangxi Province, have organized supply and marketing cooperatives with the help of the People's Government, improving their lives. Baiyun District is a mountainous area inhabited by Miao people, with a total population of about 35,000. In the past, the abundant fir, tung oil, tea, honey, and other local products of the Miao Mountains could not be sold; the few daily-use industrial products imported into the mountains were very expensive due to severe exploitation by merchants. For example, the general price difference between Rongxian County's Chang'an Town and Baiyun, only 100 miles away, was more than double. As a result, the Miao compatriots in the mountainous areas often lacked oil and salt, and their lives were very difficult. In view of the above situation, the local People's Government assisted the Miao people in organizing supply and marketing cooperatives, which supplied necessities and promoted the sale of agricultural and sideline products according to different seasons and the needs of the members. This spring, when the Baiyun District People's Government organized farmers to produce to overcome the famine, the cooperative transported 15,800 hoes and sickles to supply the members. From February to June this year, during the peak season for the sale of local products in the Miao Mountain area, the cooperative purchased more than 50,000 catties of tung oil, more than 1,500 catties of tea, and fir timber worth 300 million yuan, as well as many other local products from its members. In May, Baiyun District was short of rice, and the price of rice suddenly rose several times. In addition to buying a large amount of grain from Guizhou Province, the cooperative also borrowed some grain from the local People's Government to supply its members. The necessities supplied by the cooperative to its members were cheaper than those sold by private merchants. For example, a sickle sold for 4,500 yuan by merchants, while the cooperative sold it for only 4,000 yuan. The cooperative also paid higher prices for local products than the merchants. For example, the cooperative purchased tung oil for 78,600 yuan per 100 catties, which was 10,600 yuan higher than the merchants' purchase price. In addition, members could exchange a chicken, a duck, or a few eggs for rice, oil, salt, and other daily necessities at the cooperative at any time, which provided a lot of convenience for the members.

    After the establishment of the cooperative, the lives of the Miao people in Baiyun District have greatly improved. Taking Bangyang Village, which has the most cooperative members, as an example, the goods purchased by the cooperative members in the cooperative in the past six months were equal to the total purchase volume of all farmers in the village last year. Yang Wenguang, a member, bought only 30 catties of salt last year, but bought 30 catties in just six months this year; the number of agricultural tools used also increased by four pieces compared with the first half of last year, and cotton yarn increased by five catties. This spring, each of his family of seven wore a new set of clothes. Because the Baiyun Cooperative solved many difficulties for the local Miao compatriots, it has won the support of the Miao compatriots. When the cooperative was first established, only 560 people joined the cooperative, but by the end of July this year, the number of members had increased to more than 7,000, and the capital had increased from the original 13.06 million yuan to 74.47 million yuan.

    广西省三江县白云区苗族人民供销社有成绩
    广西省三江县白云区苗族人民在人民政府的帮助下组织了供销合作社，改善了生活。白云区是苗族人民聚居的苗山山地，全区约有三万五千苗民。历年来苗山丰富的杉木、桐子、茶叶、蜂蜜等土产销不出去；输入山内的微少日用工业品，又因商人严重的中间剥削而价格高昂。例如由融县长安镇到白云仅一百里路，两地一般物价即相差一倍以上。因此，山区苗族同胞常常断油、缺盐，生活很苦。当地人民政府根据上述情况，即协助苗族人民组织了供销合作社，由合作社根据不同季节和社员需要来供应必需品，推销农、副产品。今春白云区人民政府组织农民生产度荒时，合作社即运来一万五千八百把锄头和镰刀供应社员。今年二月到六月是苗山区土产出销时期，合作社收购社员所产的五万多斤桐子，一千五百多斤茶叶，价值三亿元的杉木，还有许多其他的土产。五月间，白云区缺米，米价突然上涨几倍，合作社除由贵州省买来大批米粮外，又向当地人民政府借一部分粮食供给社员。合作社供给社员的必需品，价钱都较私商便宜。如镰刀一把商人卖四千五百元，合作社只卖四千元。合作社收购土产也比商人的收购价格要高。如合作社收购桐子每百斤七万八千六百元，比商人的收购价格高一万零六百元。此外，社员还可以随时拿一只鸡、
    一只鸭、几个鸡蛋到合作社换回米、油、盐等日用必需品，使社员得到不少方便。
    合作社成立后，白云区苗族人民大大改善了生活。以合作社社员最多的邦阳村为例，半年来合作社社员在合作社买的货物等于去年一年全村农民购买量的总数。社员杨文广去年一年只买三十斤盐，今年半年就买了三十斤；用的农具也比去年上半年增多四件，棉纱增多五斤。今春他全家七口每人都穿了一套新衣。白云合作社因为替当地苗胞解决了许多困难，深得苗胞拥护。该社刚成立时，只有五百六十人入股，至今年七月底，社员已增加到七千多人，资金也由原来的一千三百零六万元增加到七千四百四十七万元。（新华社）
