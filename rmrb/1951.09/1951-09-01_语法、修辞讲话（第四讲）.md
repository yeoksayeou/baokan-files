Grammar and Rhetoric Talks (Lecture 4)

Lecture 4: Structure

Regarding sentence structure, a general outline was presented in the first lecture. Now, discussing structure doesn't aim to fill in that outline with a detailed picture, but rather to highlight key points and discuss common errors in structure. Before diving into sectional discussions, let's first clarify what to pay attention to in order to minimize structural issues in sentences.

First, distinguish between the main components and the subordinate elements. "Subject - Verb - (Object)" or "Subject - (Verb) - Predicate" constitutes the main structure of a sentence, with all modifiers being subordinate elements. Avoid placing what should be the main components within the subordinate elements, and don't let elements that can only be subordinate become the main components. Especially, don't allow flourishing subordinate elements to obscure your vision, preventing you from seeing the incompleteness of the main structure.

Second, recognize the underlying connections. The relationships between the various parts of the main structure, and between modifiers and the words they modify, are all connections. Even components that don't appear connected on the surface (such as appositives) have underlying connections. This is generally easy to grasp. However, sentences often contain omitted components and inverted word order, which can make the connections less obvious and lead us astray. We can't overcorrect by filling in every word that can or should be omitted, or reversing every word order that can or should be reversed, making every sentence stiff, rigid, and cumbersome. We must sharpen our eyes, paying attention not only to what's visible but also to what's hidden. What should be connected should not be separated, and what should be separated should not be connected. Above all, maintain coherence from beginning to end, and don't change course halfway through.

Finally, be honest and avoid flowery language. Many people are unwilling to be straightforward when they pick up a pen. They always feel that directness, like speaking, can hardly be considered writing, as writing needs to be "crafted." Making sentences complex is one way to "craft" writing. The result is often a failed attempt, leading not to complexity but to confusion. Dishonesty in writing generates many problems, which will be discussed in detail in the fifth lecture. Here, it's simply stated that this is also a cause of structural confusion.

First Section: Subject

Having a Subject, Lacking a Predicate. Generally, sentences consist of two parts: the subject and the predicate. Among these two parts, the predicate is particularly important. Sentences with a predicate but no subject are quite common in Chinese, while sentences with a subject but no predicate are almost nonexistent. These rare exceptions only occur in dialogues, such as "What is your honorable surname?" "Where is my hat?" In continuous language, whether spoken or written, such incomplete formats are never used. However, the following sentences suffer from the defect of a missing predicate.

(1) The importance of increased grain and cotton production to our country is not only because China's agricultural economy is proportionally large but also because we have historically relied on large imports of grain and cotton. (Newspaper)
(2) He lived on the front lines, traveled all over the country, and with his works, contributed to the motherland and humanity, he is one of the most respected writers in the Soviet Union. (Teaching material)
(3) It can be seen to what extent the attitude of concern and responsibility for the working class is weak. (Book)

(1) completely lacks a predicate. What about the "importance"? There is no explanation. "The importance of" should be changed to "is of great importance," or better yet, "is very important." The latter two sentences are not completely without predicates, but they all lack the main component that can serve as a predicate. (2)'s second "he" is followed only by the adverbial verb "with." What about "with his works"? It's missing. The comma after "works" should be removed, and "as" should be added. In (3), the word "to" cannot serve as the main component of the predicate here, and it's impossible to think of any other word that can be added before "to." The only option is to move "weak" up, making "weak to what extent" comprehensible. However, "attitude" cannot be "weak," so further modification is needed. It should be changed to "...the concern and responsibility are weak to what extent."

Having a Predicate, Lacking a Subject. "Legal" subjectless sentences are quite common in Chinese, so "illegal" subjectless sentences are often encountered. What makes a subjectless sentence legal? Consider these examples:

(4) "When did you arrive?" - "(I) just arrived."
(5) "This one?" - "(He is called) Li Dagang! My old classmate."
(6) I know a doctor, (he) is very experienced in treating this disease.
(7) Listening to his own footsteps and the light sound of the cart springs, he forgot everything. (Lao She)
(8) More than twenty years ago, "Peking Man" was discovered in Zhoukoudian.
(9) As a result of the inspection, two reds were missing, and one black was extra.
(10) It's time, I should go.

In these examples, the subject of (4) and (5) is omitted due to being "present in the context," the subject of (6) is omitted due to being "carried over," the subject of "listening" in (7) is omitted due to being "understood from below," and the subject of (8) is omitted due to being "generic." In (9), "missing" and "extra" usually don't require subjects, and "it's time" in (10) doesn't require a subject in this context.

However, the following sentences do not meet the above conditions and are therefore illegal. The underlined verbs are missing subjects.

(11) After this change, brought about rapid and vigorous development of the newspaper. (Newspaper)
(12) Due to her such good grades, received praise from all the villagers and was awarded the Order of Lenin. (Periodical)
(13) Speaking of the degree of skill reached by the author, is relatively mature and meticulous. (Newspaper)
(14) Since the beginning of summer, another twenty townships have suffered hail damage, and the affected population is more than 38,600. (Draft)
(15) On October 14th, with the aim of learning from the aviation department, our blackboard newspaper was also launched. (Periodical)
(16) When the work team began to assemble, most were apprehensive, such as being afraid that the doors of the masses would not open, afraid that the masses would ignore them, or that mass meetings would not be able to be held, afraid that representatives would not be produced, showing insufficient estimation of the level of awareness of the masses. (Periodical)

In fact, these sentences are not actually without subjects; they are simply poorly organized, failing to place the words that should be the subject in the subject position. (11) should be changed to "This change brought about..." or "After this change, the newspaper had..." (12) should be changed to "Due to her such good grades, she received..." (13) According to general practice, the word omitted before "is" is "degree," but that doesn't make sense. What makes sense is "skill," so simply saying "The author's skill is relatively mature and meticulous" would suffice. The original sentence deliberately tries to sound sophisticated but is actually incoherent. (14) should say "Another twenty townships suffered hail damage." (15) obviously imitates the sentence structure of (7), borrowing the "we" below as the subject of "with," but the subject below is not "we" but "blackboard newspaper," so this sentence is very awkward (as if the blackboard newspaper is holding a learning heart). The second half of the sentence should be changed to "we also launched a blackboard newspaper."

In (16), "showing" might seem to follow the subject "most" from above, but according to the meaning of this sentence, the subject of "showing" should be the three "fears" mentioned earlier. "These all" should be added before "showing." "Showing" is best changed to "indicating."

Mismatch between Subject and Predicate. In the second lecture, we talked about "incompatibility between predicate and subject," which refers to inappropriate word choice that requires replacement. "Mismatch" here means that the words are correct, but the arrangement is incorrect, and the meaning is incomprehensible, requiring structural adjustment. For example:

(17) China's cotton production has never been self-sufficient. (Newspaper)
(18) The discovery of the world-renowned "Peking Man," for example, was sorted out from this material. (Periodical)
(19) The history of the National Library of Paris is said to have been founded by the French King "Charles V the Wise" in 1364. (Periodical)
(20) The reactionary government's act of surrendering to the enemy and selling out North China, despite the protests of the Beijing students in two demonstrations and the unanimous opposition from all levels of the country, was still completely oblivious. (Periodical)

(17) What cannot be self-sufficient is "cotton," not "production"; (18) what was sorted out is "Peking Man," not "discovery"; (19) what was founded is "the library," not "the history"; (20) what is completely oblivious is "the reactionary government," not "the act": so it is said to be incomprehensible. It's easy to fix; just delete these four redundant words along with the preceding "of" and "of." The following three sentences are slightly different:

(21) They insist on working six hours every day. (Periodical)
(22) Due to the limitation of space, these valuable materials had to be reluctantly omitted. (Periodical)
(23) The liberation of the Chinese people has brought about fundamental changes in ethnic relations. (Periodical)

(21) "Work" cannot insist, it is "they insist on working." (22) "The limitation of space" cannot reluctantly omit, it is the editor who "because of the limitation of space" had to reluctantly omit. (23) "The liberation of the Chinese people" has not undergone changes, it is "brought about fundamental changes in ethnic relations."

(24) People's memories of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu unanimously praise their hardship and simplicity. (Periodical)
(25) The key to women's work is that first, class education should be carried out to cultivate and absorb a large number of female workers, cadres, and activists to participate in trade union work. (Periodical)
(26) The way this production mobilization meeting is held must first be fully prepared in advance in terms of content. (Book)

(24) "Memories" cannot "praise," (25) "the key" cannot "carry out," (26) "the way of holding" cannot "have preparation." These three sentences are suitable for changing the preceding phrases into clauses: (24) "When people recall Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu," (25) "To do a good job in women's work," (26) "To hold a good production mobilization meeting."

(27) Our teaching activities, our learning life, must realistically correct errors and shortcomings under constant examination and constant criticism. (Periodical)
(28) In China, the tool for expressing language still requires more laborious learning of writing, which should be said to be a layer of difficulty compared to European and American writers. (Teaching material)

To have "activities" and "life" "correct errors and shortcomings," to have "the tool" "require learning of writing," is all unreasonable. (27) can be changed to "must place our...under constant examination and criticism." (28) can be changed to "In China, the tool for expressing language—writing—still requires more laborious learning, so Chinese writers can be said to have a layer of difficulty compared to European and American writers."

(29) The lives of some of the working people have been significantly improved, some have been initially improved, and some are completing the conditions for improving their lives. (Periodical)
(30) This problem has delayed a lot of work, caused some unnecessary misunderstandings, and also caused some resentment. (Periodical)

These two sentences each have three verbs, the first of which can match the subject, but the subsequent ones are sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect. (29) Saying "The lives of the working people...are completing the conditions for improving their lives," (30) Saying "This problem...caused misunderstandings...caused resentment," is not very appropriate. (29) can be changed to "Some of the working people have seen significant improvements in their lives, some have seen initial improvements, and some are creating conditions for improvement." (30) can change "caused" to "led to" and "caused" to "stirred up."

Subject Repetition. There are often some other words between the subject and the main verb. Sometimes the author forgets that there was already a subject before and adds another one later. For example:

(31) Suburban farmers, in order to resist America and aid Korea, they picked grain before dawn and waited in front of the district government, lining up to rush to hand in public grain. (Periodical)
(32) This does not need to be introduced, anyone can guess that this is Simonov's wife. (Teaching material)
(33) Pukou Wharf, which became a transportation hub for goods between the North and South, from 1947 to 1949, ten docks collapsed six in two years. (Periodical)

(31) should remove "they." (32) Remove the "this" at the beginning. Or remove the second "this" and add "of" at the end—still a bit roundabout, so the first change is cleaner. (33) The second "wharf" should be removed.

Implicit Subject Change. In general, if the next verb has no subject, we understand that it is the same as the subject of the previous verb. But this is not always the case. For example:

(34) Playing with me are many children... we are all of similar age, but in terms of seniority, (they) are at least uncles, and some are even great-grandfathers. (Lu Xun)
(35) They wrote and sent it with great effort, their purpose is for us to see it, but how dare (we) watch it? (Mao)

This is where Chinese is less rigid in form. As long as it doesn't mislead, such lively sentences should be welcomed. (See examples 8 and 9 in the first lecture, paragraph 6.) But the following sentences cannot be defended with this reason. The underlined verbs have changed subjects.

(36) Huang Maoniu suggested that the director should go to the doctor immediately, but he was refused and instead asked him to hurry up and rent a sedan chair. (Teaching material)
(37) Economic aggression is invisible, but it is more fierce than military aggression, and the harm is deeper. (Composition)
(38) Thanks to the leadership of the People's Government, the national yarn factories launched a patriotic production competition, rushed to increase the production of 20-count yarn, and properly managed the cotton yarn market, the cotton yarn storm did not break out. (Periodical)
(39) Mao Caiming, a local tyrant in Mochang Township, Changshu, served as the puppet township chief for twenty years, acted recklessly, and the farmers he killed reached twenty-four, and raped five women. (Periodical)
(40) Currently, mastering Chinese characters is a very difficult task. To be able to streamline them in the square shape, then it can become the language of literature. (Teaching material)

These sentences all have the potential to be misunderstood, although the author's true intention is not difficult to understand. (36) should change "he was refused" to "the director refused his suggestion." (37) should change "the harm" to "it is harmful." (38) should change "and" to "at the same time, the government." (39) can change "and raped five women" to "the women he raped numbered five," but it's best to change "the farmers he killed" to "killed farmers." (40) Starting from the second clause, it should be changed to "To be able to streamline Chinese characters, then they can become the language of literature." (But what exactly it means to streamline Chinese characters is still not easy to understand.)

Implicit subject change is one of the important factors causing language confusion and should be given special attention. (End of this section, full text incomplete)

    语法、修辞讲话（第四讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第四讲结构
    关于句子的结构，第一讲里已经钩勒了一个轮廓。现在来讲结构，并不是要把这个轮廓填补成一幅详细的图画，而是要挑出几个重点来，讨论结构方面常见的错误。在分段讨论之前，先说明应该注意哪几件事情，就能使句子的结构少出毛病。
    第一，要分别主干和枝叶。“主语——动词——
    （宾语）”，或是“主语——（动词）——表语”，这是句子的主干，一切附加语是枝叶。不要把应该做主干的东西放在枝叶里，也不要让只能做枝叶的东西变成主干，尤其不要让茂盛的枝叶遮蔽你的眼睛，看不见主干的残破。
    第二，要认清潜伏的脉络。主干的各部分之间的联系，附加语和被附加语之间的联系，这些都是脉络，甚至表面上不相连接的成分（如外位语），也有脉络相通。这本来是不难把握的。可是句子里常常有省略的成分，有倒转的次序，因而脉络有时候不太显明，就会把我们引入歧途。我们又不能因噎废食，把可以省略应该省略的字全都补出来，可以倒转应该倒转的次序全都改过来，使每个句子都死死板板，笨重不堪。我们只有把眼睛擦亮，不但照顾明处，还要照顾暗处。该连的地方不能断，该断的地方不能连，尤其要能首尾照应，不要半路上变卦。
    最后，要老实，不要使花腔。许多人提起笔来就不肯老实。总觉得，像说话似的直来直往能算是文章吗？文章要“做”。把句子弄复杂是“做”文章的方法之一。结果常常是画虎不成，不是复杂而是混乱。写文章不肯老实，会生出许多毛病，第五讲要来正面讨论，这里只是说明这也是结构混乱的原因之一。
    第一段主语
    有主语，缺谓语。一般句子都有主语和谓语这两个部分。这两个部分之中，谓语尤其重要：有谓语没有主语的句子在汉语里还常常看到，有主语没有谓语的句子可说是绝无仅有。这极少的例外只在对话的时候出现，如“贵姓？”“我的帽子呢？”在连贯的语言里，无论口头或是书面，都不会有这种残缺的格式的。可是底下这些句子就犯了谓语残缺的毛病。
    （一）粮棉增产对于我们国家的重要性，不但因为我国农业经济比重大，而且因为历来依靠大量粮食棉花进口。（报）
    （二）他生活在前线，跑遍了全国，他以他的作品，对祖国对人类的贡献，他是苏联最被尊敬的作家中的一个。（教）
    （三）可见对工人阶级的关心负责的态度到何等的薄弱程度。（书）（一）完全缺谓语，“重要性”怎么样，毫无交代。应该把“的重要性”改做“有极大的重要性”，更好是改做“非常重要”。后两句不是完全没有谓语，但是都缺少可以做谓语的主要成分的东西。（二）的第二个“他”字后面只有一个副动词
    “以”，“以他的作品”怎么样呢？没有了。应该在“作品”后面去掉逗号，加“作为”。（三）的“到”字在这里不能作为谓语的主要成分，而且也想不出有什么别的字可以加在“到”的前头。只能把“薄弱”移上来，“薄弱到何等程度”是讲得通的。但是“态度”是不能“薄弱”的，还要修改。应该改做“……的关心和负责薄弱到何等程度”。
    有谓语，缺主语。“合法的”无主语的句子在汉语里相当普通，因而“不合法的”无主语句子也就常常可以遇到。怎样就是合法的无主语句？且看这些例子：
    （四）“你几时到的？”——“（我）刚到。”
    （五）“这一位？”——“（他叫）李大刚！我们老同学。”
    （六）我认得一位大夫，（他）治这个病极有经验。
    （七）听着自己的脚步，和车弓子的轻响，他忘记了一切。（老舍）
    （八）二十多年前，在周口店发现了“北京人”。
    （九）检查的结果，少了两个红的，多了一个黑的。
    （十）到时候了，我该走了。
    这里面，（四）和（五）的主语因“当前”而省略，（六）因“承上”而省略，（七）的“听着”的主语因“蒙下”而省略，（八）的主语因“泛指”而省略。（九）的“少”和“多”是照例不要主语的，（十）的“到”是在这个场合不要主语的。
    可是底下这些句子不合于上面的条件，所以是不合法的。加点的是缺少主语的动词。
    （十一）经过这个改变，带来了报纸的迅速而有
            生气的发展。（报）
    （十二）由于她这样好的成绩，得到了全庄庄员
            的赞扬，荣获了列宁勋章。（期）
    （十三）就作者技巧所达到的程度〔说〕，是比
            较成熟细致的。（报）
    （十四）入夏以来，又遭受二十个乡的雹灾，受
            灾人口有三万八千六百余人。（稿）
    （十五）十月十四日，抱着向航空系学习的心，
            我们的黑板报也创刊了。（期）
    （十六）工作队开始集中时，大多数是有顾虑
            的，如怕群众的门打不开，怕群众不理，或
        群众大会开不起来，怕代表产生不出，表现
        对群众觉悟程度估计不足。（期）其实这些句子倒不是当真没有主语，是组织得不好，没有把应该做主语的词语放在主语的位置上。（十一）应该改做“这个改变带来了……”或“经过这个改变，报纸有了……”。（十二）改做“由于这样好的成绩，她得到了……”。（十三）按一般的习惯，“是”字前面省略的是“程度”，但这是讲不通的。讲得通的是“技巧”，那么只要说是“作者的技巧是比较成熟细致的”就得了。原句故意装腔作势，反而不通了。（十四）应该说“又有二十个乡遭受雹灾”。（十五）显然是模仿（七）的句法，借用下面的“我们”做“抱着”的主语的，但是底下的主语并不是“我们”，而是“黑板报”，于是这一句就很别扭了（仿佛是黑板报抱着学习的心）。应该把下半句改做“我们也创刊了黑板报”。
    （十六）的“表现”似乎可以说是接着上面的主语“大多数”，但是按这句话的意思。“表现”的主语该是上文的三“怕”，应该在“表现”之前加“这些都”。“表现”，最好改做“表示”。
    主语和谓语配合不当。在第二讲里我们讲到过“谓语和主语不相应”，那是指用词不妥，应该更换。这里所说“配合不当”，是说字眼没错，可是安排得不对，意思讲不通，需要调整结构。例如：
    （十七）我国棉花的生产，一向不能自给。（
            报）
    （十八）如轰动世界的“北京人”之发现，就是
            这种材料里整理出来的。（期）
    （十九）巴黎国立图书馆的历史，据说是一三六
        四年由法国国王“聪明查理第五”建立基础
            的。（期）
    （二十）反动政府对敌屈服，出卖华北的行为，
        虽经北平学生两次游行示威，表示抗议，与
        全国上下一致的反对，而却毫无觉悟。（期）（十七）不能自给的是“棉花”，不是“生产”；（十八）整理出来的是“北京人”，不是“发现”；（十九）建立基础的是“图书馆”，不是“历史”；（二十）毫无觉悟的是“反动政府”，不是“行为”：所以说是讲不通。改起来很容易，只要把这四个多余的词和前面的“的”和“之”删掉就是了。底下三句不同些：
    （二一）她们每天工作坚持六小时。（期）
    （二二）篇幅的限制只好把这些宝贵的题材割爱
                了。（期）
    （二三）中国人民的解放在民族关系上起了基本
            的变化。（期）
    （二一）“工作”不会坚持，是“她们坚持工作”。
    （二二）“篇幅的限制”不会割爱，是编者“因为篇幅的限制”，只好割爱。（二三）“中国人民的解放”并没有起变化，是“使民族关系起了基本的变化”。
    （二四）人们关于毛主席与朱总司令的回忆，都
        异口同声的一致推崇他们的艰苦、朴素。
            （期）
    （二五）女工工作的关键，首先应进行阶级教
        育，培养并吸收大批的女工干部和积极分子
            参加工会工作。（期）
    （二六）这个生产动员大会的开法首先在内容上
        一定要事先有充分准备。（书）（二四）“回忆”不会“推崇”，（二五）“关键”不会“进行”，（二六）“开法”不会“有准备”。这三句宜于把前面的短语改做分句：（二四）“人们回忆毛主席和朱总司令的时候”，（二五）“要做好女工工作”，（二六）“要开好生产动员大会”。（二七）我们的教学活动，我们的学习生活，必
    须在不断的检查和不断的批评之下，实事求
    是地纠正错误和缺点。（期）
    （二八）表达言语的工具在中国却还需要更费力的文字上的学习，这比起欧美的作家应该可以说是多了一层困难。（教）要“活动”和“生活”去“纠正错误和缺点”，要
    “工具”去“需要文字上的学习”，都是说不过去的。（二七）可以改做“必须把我们的………放在不断的检查和批评之下”。（二八）可以改做“在中国，表达言语的工具——文字，却还需要更费力的学习，所以中国的作家比起欧美的作家来，可以说是多了一层困难”。
    （二九）劳动人民的生活有些得到了显著的改善，有些得到了初步的改善，有些则正在完成着改善生活的条件。（期）（三十）这个毛病耽误了多少工作，发生了一些不必要的误会，也生些闲气。（期）
    这两句的主语各有三个动词，头一个都能跟主语配合，以后就有对有不对了。（二九）说“劳动人民的生活………正在完成着改善生活的条件”，（三十）说“这个毛病……发生误会………生闲气”，都不大妥当。（二九）可以改做“劳动人民有些在生活上得到了显著的改善，有些得到了初步的改善，有些则正在创造改善的条件”。（三十）可以把“发生”改做“引起”，把“生”改做“惹出”。
    主语重复。主语和主要动词之间常常有些别的词语，有时候作者忘了前面已经有了一个主语，又在后面再来一个。例如：（三一）郊区农民为了抗美援朝，他们天不亮就挑了粮食守候在区政府的门前，排着队抢缴公粮。（期）
    （三二）这是不需要介绍谁都可以猜出这就是西蒙诺夫的夫人。（教）
    （三三）成为南北物资集散枢纽的浦口码头，从一九四七年到一九四九年，两年中十个码头竟崩塌了六个。（期）
    （三一）应该去掉“他们”。（三二）去掉头上的“这是”。或是去掉第二个“这”，在最后加“的”——还是有点绕口，不如第一种改法干净。（三三）该去掉第二个“码头”。
    暗中更换主语。一般的情形，如果下一个动词没有主语，我们的了解是它跟上一个动词的主语相同。但是实际上不完全如此。例如：（三四）和我一同玩的是许多小朋友………我们
    年纪都相仿，但论起行辈来，（他们）却至
        少是叔子，有几个还是太公。（鲁）（三五）他们辛辛苦苦地写了，送来了，其目的
    是要我们看的，可是（我们）怎么敢看呢？
        （毛）这是汉语不太拘泥形式的地方。只要不让人误会，这种生动活泼的句子是应该受欢迎的。（参阅第一讲第六段八、九两例。）但是下面这些句子就不能用这个理由来辩护。加点的是已经换了主语的动词。
    （三六）黄毛牛?建议主任应该即到医生那里去，但他被拒绝了，反而要他赶快去租滑竿。（教）
    （三七）经济侵略是无形的，然而却比军事侵略更凶猛，受害也更深。（作）
    （三八）由于在人民政府领导下，全国纱厂掀起爱国的生产竞赛热潮，突击增产二十支纱，并对纱布市场进行了适当的管理，棉纱风潮才没有爆发起来。（期）
    （三九）常熟莫城乡恶霸毛才明，当过二十年的伪乡镇长，横行不法，被他杀害的农民达二十四人，强奸妇女五人。（期）
    （四十）在目前，驾驭方块字是一件很难的工作，在方块的字形中要能使它流线型化，然后才成为文学的语言。（教）
    这些句子都有让人误会的可能，虽然作者的真意不难明白。（三六）应该把“他被拒绝了”改做“主任拒绝了他的建议”。（三七）应该把“受害”改做“为害”。（三八）应该把“并”字改做“同时政府”。（三九）可以把“强奸妇女五人”改做“被他强奸的妇女有五人”，但是最好是把“把他杀害的农民”改做“杀害农民”。（四十）从第二分句起，应该改做“要能使方块字流线型化，才能使它成为文学的语言”。（但是使方块字流线型化究竟是什么意思，还是不容易明白。）
    暗中更换主语，是造成语言混乱的重要的因素之一，应当特别注意的。（本段完，全文未完）
