    Current Health Work Tasks in Minority Areas
    He Cheng
    China's minority ethnic groups, having suffered long-term oppression and plunder by internal and external reactionary rulers, have experienced countless disasters and lived impoverished lives, leading to the continuous spread of diseases and a gradual decrease in population. The dire consequences of this situation have threatened the very survival of some minority groups.
    Based on materials collected by the Central Ministry of Health regarding the health conditions in minority areas, we recognize that carrying out health work in these areas is an urgent and pressing matter.
    Since the liberation of various minority ethnic regions on the mainland, the establishment of health work has gradually begun. The health institutions specifically restored or newly built for minority ethnic groups include 92 health centers and 24 hospitals in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, and 40 medical teams in Suiyuan, Northwest, Southwest, and Inner Mongolia. The incidence of plague in Inner Mongolia has been greatly reduced, with the 1950 rate being only about one-thousandth of the 1947 rate. The prevention and treatment of venereal diseases in Inner Mongolia has achieved results in some areas, and the population has been increasing. Thousands of primary and intermediate health workers have been trained in various regions, and a number of young people are studying at medical colleges in Beijing, Tianjin, Northeast China, and Southwest China. The arrival of health personnel has been welcomed by people of all ethnic groups, thus greatly enhancing the work enthusiasm and confidence of all health personnel.
    Following the decision of the Government Administration Council, the Central Ministry of Health convened the National Ethnic Health Conference in Beijing on August 23rd. Representatives of various ethnic groups gathered together to summarize experiences and formulate the guiding principles and tasks for future ethnic health work. The conference unanimously agreed that ethnic health work is one of the important tasks in minority areas. While there are many reasons for the decrease in population and the decline in health levels among minority groups, these phenomena can be overcome through the continuous efforts of health workers. Based on the urgent demands of ethnic health work and the current level of human, material, and financial resources, the elimination of venereal diseases, the prevention and treatment of malaria, and the promotion of maternal and child health should be the three major priorities of ethnic health work. Starting with the prevention and treatment of these diseases will not only gradually reduce their threat to the health of minority peoples, but also promote overall health work through the prevention and treatment of these diseases.
    Of course, we should not abandon the prevention and treatment of other diseases. All localities must still prevent the occurrence and spread of certain diseases according to specific conditions, adapting to local circumstances and the times. In order to accomplish the above-mentioned health work tasks, we must take the following specific measures:
    First, health institutions in minority areas are incomplete. Although some health institutions have been established and several mobile medical and epidemic prevention teams have been sent since liberation, they are still far from meeting the needs. In order to carry out future health work in minority areas, a set of health institutions should be established from top to bottom in a planned and step-by-step manner to carry out regular administrative and professional work. Those professional ethnic health institutions that have not been established or are incomplete, from the central to the local levels, should be gradually established or enriched. For special needs, some institutions for the prevention and treatment of specific diseases, such as venereal disease prevention stations and malaria prevention stations, should be established in minority areas. In pastoral areas, mobile health work teams and mobile medical and prevention teams should be established when infectious diseases are prevalent.
    In addition to fixed business institutions, in order to combine health work with mass movements and exert a greater, more universal, and more in-depth effect, mass associations—such as venereal disease prevention associations and malaria prevention associations—should be formed in minority areas under the leadership of local leading cadres, with the participation of representatives from labor, agriculture, youth, women, and other groups.
    Second, there is a severe shortage of health cadres from minority ethnic backgrounds. It is impossible to solve the health problems of minority groups with the existing forces. Therefore, we must call on health personnel from the interior to serve in minority areas and appropriately resolve their material benefits and opportunities for further study. At the same time, we must cultivate ethnic health cadres from minority groups.
    Health cadres in minority areas should unite closely and strive to do a good job in ethnic health work.
    In addition, due to the low cultural level and lack of health knowledge among minority groups, the superstition of ghosts and gods by many, and the presence of bad habits, we should vigorously carry out health propaganda work. However, in propaganda, we must pay attention to gradual progress and not be too hasty.
    Health work among minority groups is a heavy task for the health departments, but it is also an urgent and glorious task. Under the reactionary rule of the past, health work among minority groups was not valued, which was natural. Under today's people's regime, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, this work will receive the care and support of the People's Government and will definitely be done well. The success of plague prevention and treatment in Inner Mongolia, and the population increase after the prevention and treatment of syphilis in Chen Barag Banner and Solon Banner, are some good examples. We should summarize these good experiences and promote them. At the same time, we must face the difficulties before us, such as the lack of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and the insufficient experience in ethnic health work. Therefore, we must be down-to-earth, move forward steadily, and avoid the impatient disease of rushing for quick results and aiming too high.
    Since health work is a heavy task, health personnel should take the initiative to obtain the assistance of various parties, organizations, and groups, and the Party and government organs and mass organizations in various minority areas should regard guiding, assisting, and supporting health work as their own political task. Furthermore, minority areas are mostly located in border regions, so the work in minority areas—including health work—has important significance for consolidating national defense and should not be ignored.
    Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct ethnic policy, all ethnic groups in the country have been liberated and are united as never before, thus opening up a broad road for establishing ethnic health work in various minority areas. The National Ethnic Health Conference has determined certain guiding principles and tasks for health workers. As long as health workers can serve the minority groups wholeheartedly, our future will be infinitely bright.

    当前少数民族地区的卫生工作任务
    贺诚
    我国少数兄弟民族，由于过去长期地遭受内外反动统治者的压迫与掠夺，经历了无数的灾难，过着穷苦的生活，以致疾病不断流行，人口逐年减少，其恶果所趋，已经威胁到某些少数民族的生存了。
    根据中央卫生部所搜集的少数民族地区卫生状况的材料，使我们认识到：开展少数民族地区卫生工作，乃是刻不容缓的事。
    自大陆上各少数民族居住地区先后解放以来，已逐步地开始了建立卫生工作，计专为少数民族恢复和新建的卫生机构，在青海、内蒙、新疆地区有卫生院九十二所、医院二十四所，在绥远、西北、西南、内蒙地区有医疗队四十队。内蒙的鼠疫发病率，已大为减少，一九五○年的发病率，只约等于一九四七年的千分之一，内蒙的性病防治工作，在个别地区已收得成效，人口已在增加。在各区培养了成千的初级和中级卫生工作者，并有一批青年在北京、天津、东北、西南各医学院学习。卫生人员所到之处，受到各族人民的欢迎，因此大大地提高了各卫生人员的工作热情与信心。
    中央卫生部遵照政务院的决定，于八月二十三日在北京召开了全国民族卫生会议，聚集了各民族代表于一堂，总结了经验，制订了今后民族卫生工作的方针与任务。会议一致认为民族卫生工作，是少数民族地区的重要工作任务之一。少数民族人口减少、健康水平降低的原因固然甚多，但只要卫生工作人员不断地努力，这种现象是可以克服的。根据少数民族卫生工作的迫切要求及现阶段的人力、物力和经济条件，应当以扫除性病、防治疟疾及推行妇幼卫生作为少数民族卫生工作的三大重点。从防治这些疾病着手，既可逐步地减少其对少数民族人民健康的威胁，并可经过对这些疾病的防治，推动全盘卫生工作。
    当然，我们不应当放弃对其它疾病的防治工作。各地仍须根据具体情况，因地制宜，因时制宜地防止某些疾病的发生和蔓延。为了完成上列卫生工作任务，我们必须作如下的具体措施：
    第一，少数民族地区的卫生机构是不健全的。解放以后，虽然先后建立了一些卫生机构及派去若干流动性的医疗防疫队等，但距离需要还很远。为了开展今后少数民族地区卫生工作，应有计划地有步骤地从上到下建立一套卫生机构，作经常的行政与业务工作。自中央以至地方，其未成立专业的少数民族卫生机构或已成立但不健全者，均应逐步成立或充实起来，并为特殊需要，应在少数民族地区建立若干防治一定疾病的机构，如性病防治站、疟疾防治站等。在游牧地区，传染病流行时，建立流动性的卫生工作队与巡回医防队等。
    除固定的业务机构外，为使卫生工作与群众运动结合起来，发挥更大、更普遍与更深入的作用，应在少数民族地区，在当地主要领导干部主持之下，分别组成有工、农、青、妇等团体代表参加的群众性协会——性病防治协会，防疟协会等。
    第二，少数民族出身的卫生干部，非常缺乏，以现有的力量，解决少数民族的卫生工作问题，是不可能的。因此必须号召内地卫生人员到少数民族地区去服务，并适当地解决其物质待遇与进修问题。同时，培养少数民族的民族卫生干部。
    少数民族地区的卫生干部，应当紧密地团结起来，为做好民族卫生工作而努力奋斗。
    此外，由于少数民族文化水平低，卫生知识缺乏，许多人迷信鬼神，还有不良习惯，因此，我们应该大力进行卫生宣传工作。但在宣传中，必须注意由渐而进，不能操之过急。
    少数民族中的卫生工作，乃是卫生部门一个繁重的任务，但又是一个急迫而光荣的任务。在过去反动统治下，少数民族的卫生工作得不到重视，那是自然的。在今天的人民政权下，在共产党毛主席领导下，这一工作将得人民政府的关怀与支持，是一定能够做好的。内蒙地区鼠疫防治工作的成功，陈巴尔虎旗及索伦旗防治梅毒后人口的增加，就是一些很好的例子。我们应当把这些好的经验总结起来，推广出去。但同时我们必须正视摆在我们面前的困难，如人力的缺乏，和物力、财力的困难，民族卫生工作经验还不够等。因此我们必须脚踏实地，稳步前进，力避急于求成，好高骛远的急躁病。
    卫生工作既是一件繁重的工作，卫生人员就应主动地去取得各党派，机关、团体的协助，而各少数民族地区的党政机关、群众团体，则应当以指导、协助、支持卫生工作作为自己的政治任务。再者，少数民族地区多在边疆，因此少数民族地区的工作——卫生工作也在内，有着巩固国防的重要意义，不可忽视。
    在毛主席正确的民族政策指导之下，全国各民族获得了解放，并空前的团结起来了，因而为在各少数民族地区建立民族卫生工作，开辟了康庄大道；而全国民族卫生会议又为卫生工作者确定了一定的方针任务。只要卫生工作者，能全心全意为少数民族服务，我们的前途将是无限远大的。
