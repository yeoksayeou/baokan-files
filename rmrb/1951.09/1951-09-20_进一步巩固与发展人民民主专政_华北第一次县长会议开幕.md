    Further Consolidate and Develop the People's Democratic Dictatorship
    The First North China Conference of County Chiefs Opens

    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] The first North China Conference of County Chiefs opened in Beijing on the 19th. Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government; Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Dong Biwu and Huang Yanpei, Vice Premiers of the Government Administration Council; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission and Commander of the North China Military Region; Tan Pingshan, Director of the Central People's Supervision Commission; Zhang Xiruo and Peng Zemin, Deputy Directors of the Political and Legal Committee; and responsible leaders of various central departments attended to provide guidance.

    In addition to discussing the overall work tasks for North China this winter and next spring, the central task of this conference is to discuss further consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship, promoting and improving the system of county-level people's representative conferences, consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front, and strengthening the leadership of governments at all levels. The conference will also conduct a thorough inspection and arrangement of preferential treatment work.

    The conference began with an opening speech by Liu Lantao, Minister of the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government. He pointed out that the first North China Conference of County Chiefs is a pioneering event in the history of North China. He said, "The important work tasks in North China at present are to further deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, continue to suppress counter-revolutionaries, winter production and material exchange, serious production and disaster relief, vigorously support the Korean front, the people's winter school movement, strengthen urban work, and the land reform throughout Suiyuan Province, etc. In order to accomplish these important tasks, we must mobilize and rely on the strength of the broad masses of people from all walks of life, and we must rely on the powerful strength of the people's democratic united front regime. Most importantly, we must conscientiously convene the people's representative conferences, which are sufficient to unite the people from all walks of life to carry out work together, and quickly implement the exercise of the functions and powers of the county people's congress by the county people's representative conferences. Only in this way can we more broadly and closely connect the people of all democratic classes politically and organizationally, elect county chiefs, deputy county chiefs, and members of the county people's government, so that the people's representative conference becomes the highest organ of power in the locality and more effectively completes all major affairs of the state and the people."

    Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, said in his speech: The North China democratic regime has a history of more than ten years. It played a great role in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the People's Liberation War, and it has extremely rich experience. At present, the important work tasks in the North China region are to carry out various construction works, especially to do a good job in agricultural production, which requires mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of people to work together and advance in a planned manner.

    Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, explained in detail the nature and role of the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference in his speech. He said: The Standing Committee is a permanent organ that connects the people, reflects their opinions, and assists the government in its work during the adjournment of the People's Representative Conference. It is an organization of the people's democratic united front. Doing this work well will make the system of the People's Representative Conference more sound and consolidated.

    Huang Yanpei, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council, said: The basic work of political power construction is to convene the People's Representative Conference well and unite the people from all walks of life to work together. Therefore, it is necessary to promote democracy, widely absorb the opinions of the masses of the people, achieve mutual exchange and integration, reach a consensus, and then smoothly complete various work tasks.

    Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the North China Military Region, emphasized the importance of current national defense construction in his speech. He asked the people's democratic governments at all levels in North China to further rely on the people, give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, and consolidate national defense and complete various construction projects in combination with various tasks.

    Tan Pingshan, Director of the People's Supervision Commission, said: If the People's Representative Conference is convened conscientiously, the power of the people can be greatly exerted, and all central tasks can be carried out smoothly.

    Zhang Xiruo, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee, pointed out in his speech: The democratic political construction work in the North China region has made great achievements, and the people's representative conferences at all levels and from all walks of life have initially taken shape. The main task at present is how to strengthen and consolidate the existing achievements, overcome shortcomings, and improve cadres' understanding of the importance of political power construction so as to better use it to do a good job in various major tasks.

    The conference will listen to and discuss Minister Liu Lantao's "Report on Further Strengthening the County People's Representative Conference," Minister Xie Juezai of the Ministry of Internal Affairs' "Report on Conscientiously Strengthening Preferential Treatment Work," and Secretary Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Report on Developing Agricultural Production in North China."

    Attending the conference were county chiefs or deputy county chiefs from various counties (banners) in North China, commissioners or deputy commissioners from various special districts, chairmen or vice chairmen of the people's governments of various provinces, and relevant responsible cadres of the people's governments of Beijing and Tianjin. Major administrative regions also sent personnel to participate. In addition, there were more than 570 cadres from relevant agencies and organizations at the central and North China levels.
