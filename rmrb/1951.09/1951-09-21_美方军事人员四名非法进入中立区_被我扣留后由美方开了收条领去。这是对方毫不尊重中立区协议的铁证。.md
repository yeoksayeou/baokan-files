Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th. This reporter learned from the Korean-Chinese delegation that at 2:30 PM on September 18th, four military personnel from the United Nations forces, in violation of the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement, entered the Panmunjom area of the Kaesong Neutral Zone in a truck and were detained by our military police in the neutral zone. After clarifying the facts, our liaison officer notified the other party's liaison officer at 6:30 PM, agreeing to jointly handle this violation of the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement in Kaesong at 9:00 AM on September 19th. On September 19th, the two liaison officers met and interrogated the military personnel. Our liaison officer solemnly pointed out to the other party's liaison officer that, according to the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement, the road in the neutral zone from Panmunjom Bridge to Kaesong is only for the use of the United Nations forces delegation. The United Nations forces military personnel who entered Panmunjom were obviously not members of the United Nations forces delegation, and their actions in entering the neutral zone were clearly in violation of the agreement and illegal. Our liaison officer also stated that, on the order of our chief representative, the other party should pay serious attention to this obvious violation of the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement, and demanded that the other party strictly abide by the agreement in the future and prevent similar incidents from happening again. After the other party agreed to take disciplinary action against the perpetrators, our side handed over the four military personnel of the other party who had illegally entered the neutral zone, along with their trucks and belongings, to the other party's liaison officer.

Furthermore, First Sergeant Luo Guangxin, Private First Class Bian Wanzhu, Bian Jixie, and family member Li Mingzhu, the military personnel of the other party who illegally entered the neutral zone, claimed that they were members of the Field Epidemic Prevention Team of the South Korean Army Headquarters. They also claimed that they had encountered sentries from the United Nations forces before reaching Panmunjom Bridge, but the United Nations forces sentries did not stop them. This shows that the United Nations forces have not communicated to their troops the need to respect the Kaesong Neutral Zone.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Correspondent Shen Jiantu of the Telegraphic News Agency reported from Kaesong on the 19th: "You reap what you sow." - This is a major lesson from the investigation conducted by the liaison officers in Kaesong today. During the investigation, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Edwards signed a receipt to take back the four South Korean soldiers under the command of Ridgway who were arrested on the spot yesterday afternoon when they entered the neutral zone from the U.S. front.

Because the four South Korean soldiers exposed the U.S. side's unbelievable attitude of treating the neutral zone agreement like worn-out shoes, the U.S. officer had to admit for the first time that the neutral zone had been violated on the ground. In broad daylight, Ridgway's guards actually allowed four South Korean soldiers wearing U.S. uniforms and helmets to enter the neutral zone along the road used by U.S. delegation personnel to travel to and from the conference site in a 1.5-ton truck. This incident made it clear what a series of incidents of Ridgway's ground forces invading the neutral zone, which the U.S. side has always denied, were all about.

The Korean-Chinese liaison officer handed over the four South Korean soldiers and the truck to the U.S. officer, and stated at the same time that the U.S. delegation should pay serious attention to ensuring that such incidents do not happen again. No matter how clearly the agreement stipulates, the U.S. side can violate the agreement if it does not have the sincerity to implement it; this incident is a prominent example. Shortly before this incident, Ridgway's headquarters emphasized that it had taken "every possible precaution" to avoid invading the neutral zone.

    美方军事人员四名非法进入中立区
    被我扣留后由美方开了收条领去。这是对方毫不尊重中立区协议的铁证。
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社记者自朝中代表团方面获悉：九月十八日下午二时三十分联合国军军事人员四人，违反开城区中立化协议，乘卡车一辆进入开城中立区板门店地方，当被中立区内我方军事警察扣留。我方联络官在查明事实情况以后，即于下午六时三十分通知对方联络官，约定在九月十九日上午九时在开城共同处理这一违反开城区中立化协议的事件。九月十九日双方联络官会晤，并向该等军事人员讯问后，我方联络官即郑重向对方联络官指出：根据开城区中立化协议，自板门桥至开城的中立区内的公路，只供联合国军代表团人员使用，而此次进入板门店的联合国军军事人员，显非联合国军代表团人员，其进入中立区内的行动，显然是违反协议的，非法的。我方联络官并声明奉我方首席代表之命，就对方此次显然违反开城区中立化协议事件，提请对方严重注意，并要求对方以后严格遵守协议，不再发生类似事件。经对方应允对其肇事人员采取纪律制裁行动后，我方即将非法进入中立区的对方军事人员四人，及其所属卡车物品全部交由对方联络官领去。
    又据非法进入中立区的对方军事人员一等上士罗光信、一等兵边万洙、边基燮、军属李明洙声称：他们系南朝鲜陆军本部野战防疫队队员。并称：到达板门桥以前曾遇见联合国军方面的哨兵，而联合国军方面的哨兵并未加以拦阻。可见联合国军方面对其部队应尊重开城中立区一事，并未加以传达。
    【新华社二十日讯】电通社记者沈建图十九日自开城报道：“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。”——这是联络官今天在开城进行的调查的一大教训；在进行调查中，美方爱德瓦兹中校签写收条，把在昨日下午从美方战线进入中立区时当场被捕的李奇微手下的四名南朝鲜士兵领回去了。
    由于四名南朝鲜士兵暴露了美方把中立区协议当作敝屣一样的令人难以置信的态度，美方校官不得不第一次承认在地面上侵犯中立区的行为。在光天化日之下，李奇微的警卫部队竟然允许四名穿美军制服、戴钢盔的南朝鲜军队乘一吨半卡车沿美方代表团人员来往于会址区的道路进入中立区。这次事件使人看清楚了美方一向抵赖的李奇微地面部队侵犯中立区的一连串事件究竟是怎么一回事。
    中朝方面的联络官已将四名南朝鲜士兵和卡车交给这位美国校官，同时并声明，要美方代表团严重注意确保这样的事件不再发生。不管协议规定得怎样清楚，美方如果没有诚意执行这个协议，就可以破坏这个协议；这个事件就是一个显著的例子。在这个事件发生以前不久，李奇微总部还强调说它已采取了“每一种可能的预防措施”以避免侵犯中立区。
