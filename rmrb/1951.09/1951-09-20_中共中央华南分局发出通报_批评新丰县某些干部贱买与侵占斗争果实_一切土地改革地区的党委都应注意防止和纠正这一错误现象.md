    The CCP Central Committee South China Sub-Bureau Issues Circular
    Criticizing Certain Cadres in Xinfeng County for Selling Struggle Fruits Cheaply and Occupying Them
    Party Committees in All Land Reform Areas Should Pay Attention to Preventing and Correcting This Erroneous Phenomenon
    The CCP Central Committee South China Sub-Bureau issued a circular on August 31st, criticizing the erroneous behavior of land reform work team members in Xinfeng County, Guangdong, for purchasing and occupying the fruits of the struggle of the masses at low prices. The circular pointed out: This erroneous behavior will inevitably cause serious dissatisfaction among the masses, damage the prestige of the Party and the People's Government, and will seriously corrupt the ideology of Party members and cadres.
    According to a report from the CCP Xinfeng County Committee: Since the launch of the rent reduction and deposit refund, and the suppression of bandits and local bullies movement in Xinfeng County, among the 250 cadres participating in land reform in the county, 77 people have purchased and occupied the fruits of the rent reduction and deposit refund struggle at low prices. For example, Zheng Fanzeng from the Third District, while working in Changfeng in the First District, secretly misappropriated 210,000 yuan in people's currency, a two-qian gold ring, and a suitcase from the fruits of the struggle with former peasant association cadres. Furthermore, Lu Gantang of Yanta Village in the First District entrusted someone to buy mosquito nets, sheets, and other items at a low price, originally valued at 200,000 yuan in people's currency, but only paid 45,000 yuan. This situation is extremely serious. This is a disguised form of corruption in violation of discipline. This behavior has seriously damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses, and the masses have already voiced criticism. After discovering the above situation, the Xinfeng County Committee immediately launched criticism and self-criticism among the cadres and publicly admitted their mistakes to the masses, which has largely resolved the problem. This is absolutely necessary. In order to profoundly educate the personnel who have made mistakes and other personnel, the South China Sub-Bureau pointed out that disciplinary action must be taken against those whose circumstances are serious and the masses are extremely dissatisfied with.
    Similar situations have also occurred in other land reform areas in South China. Therefore, the South China Sub-Bureau instructed all localities to implement the "Eight Disciplines Regarding Cadres During Land Reform" of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, to correct and prevent cadres from occupying or disguisedly occupying the fruits of the masses' struggle, and suggested to people's governments at all levels: In the recent enlarged cadre meeting or other meetings, there should be a serious review of whether cadres have occupied the fruits of the masses' struggle. If so, these cadres should be educated and allowed to conduct self-examination so that they can recognize the seriousness of this mistake. At the same time, they should be dealt with according to the seriousness of the circumstances: ordinary cadres who directly purchase the fruits of struggle from the peasant association at low prices should all return the original items and make a public self-criticism to the masses, admitting their mistakes; individual individuals with serious circumstances must be given appropriate punishment.

    中共中央华南分局发出通报
    批评新丰县某些干部贱买与侵占斗争果实
    一切土地改革地区的党委都应注意防止和纠正这一错误现象
    中共中央华南分局，在八月三十一日发出通报，批评广东新丰县土地改革工作队员贱价购买与侵占群众斗争果实的错误行为。通报指出：这种错误行为，必定会引起群众严重不满，破坏党与人民政府的威信，且将严重地腐蚀党员干部的思想。
    据中共新丰县委报告：新丰县自开展退租退押、清匪反霸运动以来，在全县二百五十名参加土地改革的干部中，有七十七人贱价收买与侵占退租退押的斗争果实。如第三区郑范增在第一区长丰工作时，即与旧农会干部秘密挪用斗争果实人民币二十一万元、二钱重金戒指一只、皮箱一只。又第一区雁塔村吕甘棠托人贱买蚊帐、被单等件，原值人民币二十万元，但只交了四万五千元。这种情况是极端严重的。这是违反纪律的变相贪污行为。这种行为严重地破坏了党和人民政府在群众中的威信，群众对此已提出批评。新丰县委发现上述情况后，当即在干部中展开批评与自我批评，并向群众公开承认错误，使大部问题获得解决，这是完全必要的。为了深刻地教育犯错误的人员以及其他人员，华南分局指出，对情节严重、群众极为不满的分子，必须给以纪律处分。
    华南其他土地改革地区亦有类似情况，因此华南分局指示各地必须贯彻中南军政委员会“关于干部在土地改革时期的八项纪律”，纠正与防止干部侵占或变相侵占群众斗争果实的现象，并向各级人民政府建议：在最近召开的扩大干部会议或其他会议上，应当认真检查有无干部侵占群众斗争果实的现象，如有，即应对这些干部进行教育，并让他们进行检讨，使其认识这种错误的严重性，同时根据情节轻重，分别予以处理：一般干部从农会直接贱价购买斗争果实者，一律退回原物，并向群众公开进行检讨，承认错误；对个别情节严重的分子，必须给以适当处分。
