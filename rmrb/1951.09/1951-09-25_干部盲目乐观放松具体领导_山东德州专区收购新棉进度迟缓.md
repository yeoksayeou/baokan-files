Editor's Note: The fundamental reason for the slow progress in purchasing and storing new cotton in Dezhou Prefecture is that many cadres are blindly optimistic in their thinking, thus relaxing specific leadership. These cadres believe that farmers will sell cotton themselves and that the work of purchasing and storing new cotton can be easily completed. Therefore, they do not carry out in-depth political mobilization of farmers, do not resolutely fight against the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants, and do not carry out a series of organizational work in terms of personnel allocation, processing, and material supply. In this way, the task of purchasing and storing new cotton cannot be completed smoothly. All cotton-producing areas should seize the favorable opportunity of the new cotton market, learn from the experiences and lessons of purchasing and storing old cotton in June, July, and August, overcome existing shortcomings, and strive to complete this task of great significance to the national economy and people's livelihood.

The work of purchasing and storing new cotton in Dezhou area, Shandong Province, is developing day by day. The purchase volume of local cooperatives and cotton yarn cloth companies is gradually increasing. At the beginning of September, the daily purchase was more than 100,000 jin (seed cotton, same below), increasing to 300,000 to 400,000 jin around the 5th, and further increasing to more than 500,000 jin on the 9th. However, the progress of the acquisition work in this area is still very slow, and the amount acquired is only one-tenth of the actual harvest of cotton farmers, which should be noted. After the new cotton was put on the market in late August, the Dezhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Prefectural Finance and Economics Committee separately deployed the work of purchasing and storing new cotton, and reorganized the New Cotton Purchasing and Storing Committee on the basis of the original organization for purchasing and storing old cotton. The secretary of the Prefectural Committee and the deputy director of the Prefectural Finance and Economics Committee served as the director and deputy director, respectively, and cadres from various departments such as cotton yarn cloth companies and cooperatives were transferred to Wuqiao and other places to assist in the development of base point work; and specific instructions were given to relevant business departments to make appropriate preparations and cooperation. For example, the cotton yarn cloth company added three offices in Dongguang, Quti (Jiyang), and Yancheng (Qihe), totaling sixteen cotton collection points including last year, and specifically divided the acquisition market with the cooperative. The whole district entrusted 432 grass-roots societies to carry out agency purchase business. Most counties have reorganized new cotton purchasing and storing committees and offices, and convened district and township cadre meetings and cotton farmer representative meetings at the township level for deployment. After carrying out patriotic ideological education, the cotton farmers in Chengguan District of Linyi proposed the slogan of "sell quickly, store quickly" in the revision of the patriotic convention. According to the statistics of various county cooperatives and cotton yarn cloth companies in the past ten days (as of September 8), about 2.1 million jin of new cotton have been purchased. However, there are still many shortcomings in this stage of work, and the acquisition progress of each county is very slow, especially in Wuqiao, Dongguang and other counties. Because it is not sufficiently combined with other central tasks, it has not been quickly implemented to the villages. The amount purchased in the whole district is far from the actual harvest of cotton farmers. At present, the "first spray" of root flowers is almost picked, and a large number of "middle spray" flowers (cotton in full bloom) will soon be on the market. If each mu has harvested 10 jin of new cotton, the whole district can pick at least 20 million jin of new flowers, but only more than 2 million jin have been purchased now (as of the 8th), accounting for only 10% of the actual harvest of cotton farmers. This is a problem that deserves serious attention. There are five main reasons for this phenomenon:

    (1) Cadres have blindly optimistic emotions and neglect the political mobilization of cotton farmers. Some cadres have failed to properly analyze and study the objective and subjective conditions for completing the purchase and storage of cotton, and have blindly optimistic emotions, thus ignoring the central link of fully mobilizing the masses. They believe that "when the cotton comes down, the cotton farmers have to sell the cotton." There is no need for much mobilization, and the cotton farmers will sell the cotton. Some cadres, seeing that some cotton farmers are selling cotton in order to urgently sell cotton in exchange for needed goods, believe that political mobilization can be relaxed. For example, the Sangyuan and Caowa cooperatives in Wuqiao County collect about 20,000 jin of cotton per day, and a section chief of the county cooperative association even believes that "the phenomenon of cotton farmers not selling cotton is individual." However, in fact, the amount purchased in the county (about 400,000 jin) accounts for only 10% of the actual harvest of cotton farmers. It is precisely because of such blindly optimistic emotions that the ideological education and political mobilization of cotton farmers have been relaxed, and the masses have not been fully mobilized. Many cotton farmers have picked cotton, but they do not sell it or sell very little. It is estimated that the farmers in Ningjin County have harvested 3.9 million jin of new cotton, but the county has only purchased more than 260,000 jin of seed cotton from September 1 to 9, less than 7% of the total.

    (2) Failure to organize sufficient forces to fully acquire new cotton. Some leading cadres are blindly optimistic about the purchase and storage of new cotton. Therefore, they only attach importance to leading the relevant business departments, and relax the organization of all party and government forces to fully implement this work. For example, when organizing forces to go to various counties to assist in the work this time, only 20 cadres were drawn from the four departments of cotton yarn cloth companies, cooperatives, banks, and oil companies, which is less than one-tenth of the strength organized during the previous period of purchasing and storing old cotton. Some local party and government leaders still have the idea of letting business departments be solely responsible. When encountering other central tasks, they squeeze out the cotton purchasing and storing work and push it to the business departments to do it themselves. The cotton purchasing and storing committees of the counties have not yet made a written report to the cotton purchasing and storing committee of the prefectural committee and the special office, which has led to a lack of communication between the upper and lower levels and a failure to exert the due strength. The cotton purchasing and storing committee of the special office has also failed to play its due role.

    (3) The organization of processing work is very weak. At the beginning of the cotton purchasing and storing work, leaders at all levels had realized that organizing processing was an important issue, but they still underestimated its seriousness. The original plan of the whole district was to organize 56 cotton ginning plants by cotton yarn cloth companies and cooperatives, with a total of 5,818 cotton ginning machines, but at present, these two departments have only organized more than 2,500 machines, which is far from the total requirement; Wuqiao County has not yet concentrated a cotton ginning machine. This has resulted in a large backlog of seed cotton in various places because it cannot be ginned, even though not much cotton has been collected.

    (4) Material supply cannot keep up with actual needs. In terms of material supply, the relevant business departments have also underestimated the new situation. The grain company initially lacked initiative and careful planning, and believed that there was no problem with grain supply. After the new cotton acquisition began, farmers urgently needed to purchase grain, but the grain company was slow to dispatch due to transportation restrictions, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, and a decoupling of market prices from listed prices, causing small fluctuations in grain prices in some areas. Some grain companies do not understand the important significance of close cooperation in acquisition work, and have the idea of being reluctant to sell. The most serious is the director of the Shanghe Grain Office, who took a confrontational attitude towards the resolution of the county finance and economics committee to quickly transfer grain to supply the market, and went home without the approval of the finance and economics committee, abandoning leadership and causing market grain price fluctuations.

    (5) Relaxing market management, private merchants take the opportunity to carry out illegal activities. Although market management in various places has been strengthened and some results have been achieved by taking the opportunity, the illegal cotton collection activities of private merchants still exist. For example, in Yancheng, Qihe County, more than 2,000 jin of cotton were put on the market on September 3, and 50% of it was taken away by private merchants raising prices. Some private merchants ostensibly obey market management, but secretly come up with some tricks to carry out acquisitions secretly. For example, Shanghe found many women on the market to buy cotton; other areas also have similar disguised acquisition phenomena.

    The above situation has attracted the attention of some places and has been improved to some extent, but it still needs to be greatly improved.

### 干部盲目乐观放松具体领导  山东德州专区收购新棉进度迟缓

    干部盲目乐观放松具体领导
    山东德州专区收购新棉进度迟缓
    编者按：德州专区购储新棉进度迟缓的基本原因，是许多干部思想上盲目乐观，因而放松了具体领导。这些干部认为农民自己会卖棉花，购储新棉的工作可以轻易完成，于是不对农民进行深入的政治动员，不和奸商的非法活动进行坚决的斗争，不在人力配备、加工、物资供应等方面，进行一系列的组织工作，这样，购储新棉的任务，当然就不能顺利完成了。各产棉区应该抓紧新棉上市的有利时机，接受六、七、八月间购储陈棉的经验教训，克服现存的缺点，争取完成这一对国计民生有重大意义的任务。
    山东德州地区新棉购储工作日益展开。当地合作社与花纱布公司的收购量逐步增加，九月初每日收购十余万斤（籽棉，下同），至五日前后增至三、四十万斤，九日更增至五十余万斤。但该区收购工作的进展还很迟缓，已收购数量仅及棉农实际收获量的十分之一，这是应该引起注意的。八月下旬新棉登市后，中共德州地委及专署财政经济委员会即先后分头布置新棉购储工作，并在原有购储陈棉组织的基础上，重组购储新棉委员会，由地委书记、专署财政经济委员会副主任分任正副主任，并抽调花纱布公司、合作社等各部门干部，分赴吴桥等地协助开展基点工作；并具体指示有关业务部门，进行适当的准备与配合。如花纱布公司增设了东光、曲堤（济阳）、晏城（齐河）三个办事处，连去年共有十六个收棉点，并和合作社具体划分收购市场，全区共委托四百三十二处基层社展开代购业务。多数县都重组购储新棉委员会与办公室，分别召开区、乡干部会议和以乡为单位的棉农代表会议，进行布置。临邑、商河等县购棉储棉工作已很快贯彻至村。临邑城关区棉农于进行爱国主义思想教育后，在修订爱国公约中，提出“快卖、快存”的行动口号。据各县合作社与花纱布公司近十天来统计
    （截至九月八日），已收购新棉约在二一○余万斤。但这一阶段工作，还存在许多缺点，各县的收购进度是十分迟缓的，特别是吴桥、东光等县，由于与其他中心任务结合不够，至今尚未很快贯彻至村。全区收购数量与目前棉农实际收获量相差很远。目前一般“头喷”根花已快摘尽，大量的“中喷”花（盛放时期的棉花）即将上市，如以每亩已拾新棉十斤计，全区至少可拾新花二千万斤以上，而现在仅收购了二百余万斤（截至八日止），只占棉农实际收获量的百分之十。这是一个值得引起严重注意的问题。产生这种现象的主要原因有五：
    （一）干部存在盲目乐观情绪，忽视对棉农的政治动员。有些干部对完成购储棉的主客观条件没能很好地加以分析研究，存在着盲目乐观情绪，因而忽略了充分发动群众的中心环节。他们认为“棉花下来了，棉农得卖棉花。”用不着怎么动员，棉农就会把棉花卖出来。有些干部看到部分棉农因急需卖棉换回需用物品，而纷纷出售棉花的现象，就认为可以放松政治动员。如吴桥县桑园、曹洼合作社每天收棉花二万斤左右，该县合作总社某股长竟认为：“棉农不卖棉花的现象是个别的。”但实际上该县收购数量（四十万斤左右）仅占棉农实际收获量的百分之十。正是由于存在着这样的盲目乐观情绪，所以就放松了对棉农的思想教育与政治动员，未能充分地把群众发动起来。很多棉农虽拾有棉花，却不出卖或出卖的很少。宁津县现在估计农民已收下新棉有三百九十万斤，而该县自九月一日至九日仅收购籽棉二十六万余斤，不及总数百分之七。
    （二）没有组织足够的力量，全力收购新棉。某些领导干部对新棉购储工作存在盲目乐观情绪，因此，他们只重视领导各有关业务部门，而放松了组织全体党政力量，全力贯彻这一工作。如这次组织力量分赴各县协助工作时，仅在花纱布公司、合作社、银行、油脂公司等四部门抽调二十个干部，尚不及前一时期购储陈棉时所组织的力量的十分之一。有些地方的党、政领导干部还存在着让业务部门单独负责的思想，遇到其他中心任务，就把购棉储棉工作挤掉，推给业务部门自己去做。各县购棉储棉委员会还没有正式向地委、专署购棉储棉委员会作过一次书面报告，致使上下不通气，不能发挥应有的力量。专署购棉储棉委员会同样没有发挥应有的作用。
    （三）组织加工工作十分薄弱。在购棉储棉工作开始时，各级领导干部虽已认识组织加工是个重要问题，但对其严重性仍估计不足。全区原计划由花纱布公司与合作社组织人力轧花厂五十六处，计轧花车五千八百一十八盘，但目前这两个部门只组织了二千五百多盘，距离总的要求很远；吴桥县至今还没有集中起一个轧花车。这就使得各地目前虽收花不多，但因轧不出来，积压很多籽棉。
    （四）物资供应赶不上实际需要。在物资供应上，有关业务部门对新情况的估计也是不足的。粮食公司开始缺乏主动与周密计划，认为粮食供应无问题。新棉收购开始后，农民急需购买粮食，而粮食公司则因受运输条件的限制，一时调度迟缓，供求失调，市价与牌价脱节，造成部分地区粮价发生小的波动。部分粮食公司对于密切配合收购工作的重要意义认识不够，存在惜售思想。最严重的是商河粮食办事处主任，对县财政经济委员会决定迅速调运粮食供应市场的决议，采取对抗态度，竟不经财政经济委员会批准迳自回家，放弃领导，造成市场粮价波动。
    （五）放松市场管理，私商乘机进行非法活动。目前各地市场管理上虽已加强，并乘机取得某些成效，但各地私商的非法收棉活动，还是存在着的。如齐河县晏城，在九月三日集上共上棉二千多斤，即被私商抬价收去百分之五十。有的私商表面上服从市场管理，但却暗地里想出一些花样偷偷进行收购。如商河发现很多妇女登市购棉；其他地区也有类似化形收购的现象。
    以上情况，目前有些地方虽已引起注意，并已有所改进，但仍须继续大力改进。
