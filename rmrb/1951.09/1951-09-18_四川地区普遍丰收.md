	Sichuan Province has basically completed its autumn harvest. With the exception of a very few areas that experienced a slight reduction in yield, the harvests in the four administrative regions of Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan averaged 80% to 90% of expectations. Crops such as cotton and sugarcane have not yet been fully harvested and are not included in these figures. In the Chengdu Plain of Western Sichuan, the average yield of more than five million mu of rice reached 450 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 700 jin, an increase of 10% compared to previous years. The yields of sorghum, corn, and beans in various areas also increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year. In the Southern Sichuan region, the counties along the Yangtze River saw 90% rice yields and 100% sorghum yields. According to farmers, this is an unprecedented harvest in the past twenty years.

	This year's autumn harvest was generally timely and swift, typically ending ten days earlier than last year. Especially in areas where land reform has been completed, the vast majority of farmers are extremely enthusiastic about production, universally putting forward the slogan of "harvest quickly, thresh quickly, dry quickly, and put into storage quickly." Currently, farmers in various areas are drying and winnowing their grain, preparing to pay agricultural tax and complete their donation plans. Farmers in Meishan County, Western Sichuan, have already donated rice worth more than 800 million yuan from their increased production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川地区普遍丰收
    四川地区秋收已基本结束，除了极个别地区稍有歉收外，川东、川西、川南、川北四个行政区的收获平均有八成至九成。棉花、甘蔗等作物目前尚未收毕，不计在内。川西成都平原的五百多万亩水稻，平均每亩产量达四百五十斤，最高的七百斤，比往年增产一成。各地的高粱、玉米和豆类亦较去年增产一成至二成。川南区长江沿线各县稻谷九成，高粱十成，据农民反映此为二十年来所未有的丰收。
    今年的秋收普遍做到了及时、迅速。一般比去年提前十天结束。特别是完成土地改革的地区，广大农民生产情绪极为高涨，普遍提出“快割、快打、快晒、快入仓”的口号。现各地农民正将谷子风干、扬净，准备缴纳公粮和完成捐献计划；川西眉山县农民，已从增产中捐献了共值八亿元以上的稻谷。（新华社）
