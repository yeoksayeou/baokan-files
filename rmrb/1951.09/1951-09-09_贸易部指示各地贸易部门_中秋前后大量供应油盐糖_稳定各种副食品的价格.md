    Ministry of Trade Directs Local Trade Departments
    to Supply Large Quantities of Oil, Salt, and Sugar Around the Mid-Autumn Festival
    Stabilizing the Prices of Various Non-staple Foods

    As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions to the trade departments of local people's governments to stabilize the prices of non-staple foods around the Mid-Autumn Festival. The instructions require state-owned trading companies in various regions to supply large quantities of staple foods such as rice and flour, as well as non-staple foods such as oil, salt, and sugar, at listed prices. The instructions also require state-owned native produce, general merchandise, retail, and trust companies, as well as cooperatives, to expand their business scope, appropriately develop retail businesses, and provide as much as possible commodities such as oil, salt, sugar, fruits, meats, vermicelli, alkali noodles, and pastries. When stabilizing prices before and after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the trade departments of local people's governments may convene relevant private merchants from various industries to discuss and announce the prices of various non-staple foods, requiring merchants to supervise each other and practice the patriotic pact; and call on the people in the cities to report illegal merchants who hoard goods or refuse to sell them at any time.
