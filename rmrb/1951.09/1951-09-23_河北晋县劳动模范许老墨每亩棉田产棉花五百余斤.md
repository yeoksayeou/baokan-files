Hebei Jin County Model Worker Xu Laomo Yields Over 500 Jin of Cotton Per Mu

    Beipengjia Village in Jin County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, has been evaluated by village cadres and model workers as a high-yield cotton planting village in the county. This year, Beipengjia Village planted a total of 1,845 mu of cotton, accounting for 70% of the village's total cultivated land area. Calculated based on the cotton bolls that have already grown, the village can harvest an average of 220 jin of seed cotton per mu. The nine mu of cotton belonging to labor model Xu Laomo are growing particularly well. His cotton fields have 1,800 cotton seedlings per mu, with an average of 22.5 cotton bolls per seedling. If there are no unexpected disasters in the future, he can guarantee a harvest of over 500 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    What are the main reasons why Beipengjia Village has been able to become a high-yield cotton planting village in the county?

    First, before sowing this spring, each household in the village, led by village cadres, Communist Party members, and labor models, formulated patriotic high-yield plans. At that time, Xu Laomo's cotton planting plan was to produce 600 jin of seed cotton per mu; other village cadres and cotton farmers also formulated plans for 300, 400, or 500 jin respectively. Subsequently, cadres and the masses put forward the slogan of learning from labor model Xu Laomo, and a patriotic high-yield movement was launched throughout the village between households, the masses, and cadres.

    In order to achieve his cotton planting high-yield plan, labor model Xu Laomo often went to the county farm to learn scientific cotton management techniques. Under his leadership, Beipengjia Village established a cotton planting technology group to specifically guide the villagers in managing cotton fields using scientific methods. Under his and the technology group's guidance, the village's cotton farmers learned new techniques such as pest control, pruning, topdressing, intertillage, and earthing-up, and changed many old management methods.

    In early July this year, in order to promote the village's cotton planting experience and cotton field management methods, the Jin County People's Government organized village cadres and labor models to visit the village in the fields twice and held discussions to exchange experiences. The 103 village cadres and labor models from five districts and forty villages in the county unanimously evaluated Beipengjia Village as a high-yield cotton planting village in the county. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office has awarded the village a silk banner and a sprayer. Recently, the Commissioner's Office convened 90 labor models from various counties in the prefecture to form a visiting group, which departed on the 10th of this month to visit Beipengjia Village in person, in order to promote Beipengjia Village's cotton planting experience and cotton field management methods throughout the prefecture.

    河北晋县劳动模范许老墨每亩棉田产棉花五百余斤
    河北省石家庄专区晋县北彭家庄，已被全县村干部和劳动模范评定为全县植棉丰产村。北彭家庄今年共种棉花一千八百四十五亩，占全村总耕地面积百分之七十。按现在已长成的棉桃计算，全村平均每亩可摘籽棉二百二十斤。劳动模范许老墨的九亩棉花长得特别好，他的棉田每亩有一千八百棵棉苗，平均每棵有二十二点五个棉桃，今后如无意外灾害，每亩可保证摘籽棉五百余斤。
    北彭家庄所以能够成为全县植棉丰产村，主要的原因是什么呢？
    首先，在今年春季播种前，该村各户都在村干部、共产党员和劳动模范带头下，订出了爱国丰产计划。当时许老墨的植棉计划是每亩产籽棉六百市斤；其他村干部和棉农也分别订出三百、四百或五百斤的计划。接着，干部和群众提出向劳动模范许老墨看齐的口号，全村户与户、群众和干部便展开了爱国丰产运动。
    劳动模范许老墨为争取实现植棉丰产计划，常到县农场学习管理棉花的科学技术。在他的领导下，北彭家庄成立了植棉技术小组，专门指导全村群众用科学办法管理棉田。全村棉农在他和技术组的指导下，学会了除虫、整枝、施追肥、中耕、培土等新技术，改变了许多旧的管理方法。
    今年七月初，晋县人民政府为了推广该村的植棉经验和管理棉田的方法，曾先后两次组织村干部和劳动模范至该村进行田间参观，并举行座谈，交流经验。全县五个区、四十个村、一百零三个村干部和劳动模范，一致评定北彭家庄是全县植棉丰产村。石家庄专署已奖给该村锦旗一面、喷雾器一架。最近专署又召集全专区各县劳动模范九十人，组成参观团，于本月十日出发，至北彭家庄实地参观，以便把北彭家庄的植棉经验和管理棉田的方法推广到全专区。（孙振何、赵公武、任心顺、耿英、任健）
