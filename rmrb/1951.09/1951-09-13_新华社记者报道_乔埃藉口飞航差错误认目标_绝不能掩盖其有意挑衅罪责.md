Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th: A reporter from this agency reports: In his letter to General Nam Il today, Joye, the chief representative of the United Nations Command for armistice negotiations, said that the UN aircraft strafing the Kaesong neutral zone at 1:35 PM on September 10th was because the American pilot "made an aerial strafing attack on a target he mistakenly identified due to air navigation error." Joye thought that this would absolve the U.S. side of the guilt of deliberately creating a provocative incident.

However, Joye's approach cannot deceive anyone with a little common sense. Kaesong is a vital transportation hub. The wide, Class A highway from Pyongyang to Seoul passes through here. To its north is a very high mountain, the peak of which is the demarcation ridge of the 38th parallel, and to its southeast is the Imjin River. Such a geographical situation is easy to identify from the air, even at night. Moreover, on the night of the U.S. aircraft strafing incident, there were no clouds over Kaesong. How could the American pilot strafe "because of a navigation error"? Did the American pilot not know where Kaesong was, or that the agreement on the neutralization of Kaesong had been established as early as July 14th? The answer is: either the U.S. side does not take the Kaesong neutralization agreement seriously, and therefore did not order the UN forces to be bound by this agreement; or the U.S. side has been deliberately undermining the Kaesong neutralization agreement, and therefore has repeatedly sent troops to kill our military police in Kaesong, and sent planes to bomb and strafe the residences of our negotiating representatives. One of the two must be true. However, Ridgway has repeatedly stated that he has ordered his troops to "abide by the agreement." Therefore, the U.S. aircraft strafing incident on September 10th, like the 170 sorties of U.S. aircraft violating the neutral zone since August 17th, was deliberately created by the U.S. side, and not due to "air navigation error" by American pilots.

It should also be pointed out that Joye said in his letter that the American pilot "made an aerial strafing attack on a target he mistakenly identified." What exactly was the "target he mistakenly identified"? When reporters accompanied investigators from both sides to the strafing site on the 10th, they saw that the "target mistakenly identified" by the American pilot was a Korean civilian house. Could it be that the American pilot mistook this civilian house for the so-called "Communist division-sized unit" or "tank unit" fabricated by the U.S. side a few days ago? Reporters have learned from Kaesong residents in the past few days that the U.S. and Rhee troops on the Imjin River front have recently threatened Kaesong residents, saying things like "The United Nations forces are about to attack" and "Don't testify for the Communists." Is one of the purposes of the U.S. aircraft strafing Kaesong civilian houses also to intimidate the people of Kaesong? This question needs to be truthfully confessed by Ridgway Headquarters.

The Ridgway Headquarters statement that radar detected that the aircraft was one from the 3D Bomber Group is another strange tale. Why can radar not only determine the nationality of the aircraft, but also the unit to which the aircraft belongs? Why could radar not indicate anything during the previous two U.S. aircraft bombings of the Kaesong neutral zone? The only reasonable answer is: both this time and the previous two U.S. aircraft bombings and strafings were premeditated by the U.S. Air Force, and the so-called radar detection is just an arbitrarily distorted excuse.

Ridgway Headquarters wants to feign a "confession" this time to cover up previous denials. This cannot succeed. On the contrary, this can only prove that the U.S. Air Force was responsible for the previous two bombings and strafings of the Kaesong neutral zone, as well as the many previous aircraft infringements over the Kaesong neutral zone. Because of this, even though U.S. radar detected the existence of the aircraft, the U.S. Air Force was able to ignore it.

    乔埃藉口飞航差错误认目标
    绝不能掩盖其有意挑衅罪责
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社记者报道：联合国军停战谈判首席代表乔埃在今日给南日将军的信中说，九月十日一时三十五分联合国军飞机扫射开城中立区，是美国飞行员“因为飞航差错而向被他误认的目标作空中扫射攻击”。乔埃以为，这样一来就可以推卸美方有意制造挑衅事件的罪责了。
    但是乔埃这种手法不能瞒过稍有常识的人。开城是交通要道，从平壤至汉城的宽大的甲级公路经过这里，它的北面有一座很高的大山，山顶就是三八线的分界岭，它的东南方是临津江。这样的地理形势，即使在夜间也很容易在空中辨认出来。何况发生美机扫射事件的当夜，开城上空没有云层，美国飞行员怎么会“因为飞行差错”而扫射起来呢？难道美国飞行员根本不知道开城在什么地方，根本不知道早在七月十四日即已成立的关于开城中立化的协议吗？答案是：或者美方根本不把开城中立化协议当作一回事，因此也就没有命令联合国部队受这个协议的约束；或者美方一直就蓄意破坏开城中立化协议，因此，就一而再地派部队杀害开城我方军事警察，派飞机轰炸扫射我方谈判代表住处。二者必居其一。但是，李奇微早就口口声声说，他已命令他的部队“遵守协议”了。因此，九月十日美机扫射事件，如同八月十七日以来美机一百七十架次侵犯中立区事件一样，是美方蓄意制造的，并非美国飞行员“因为飞航差错”。
    还应当指出，乔埃来信说，美国飞行员“向被他误认的目标作空中扫射攻击”。试问什么是“被他误认的目标”呢？记者于十日随双方调查人员到美机扫射地点采访时看到，被美国飞行员“误认的目标”是一间朝鲜民房。难道美国飞行员竟把这间民房误认为前些日子美方捏造的所谓“共产党整师部队”或“坦克部队”吗？记者这几天从开城居民口中得知，临津江前线的美李军队最近恫吓开城居民，说什么“联合国军就要进攻的”、“不要替共产党作证”。美机扫射开城民房，其目的之一是不是也为的要恫吓开城人民呢？这个问题是需要李奇微总部从实招认的。
    李奇微总部声明雷达侦察出飞机是3D轰炸机大队的一架飞机。这又是一个奇谈。雷达为什么不但能判明飞机所属的国别，而且能判明飞机所属的队别呢？为什么以前两次美国飞机轰炸开城中立区时，雷达却什么也不能指明呢？唯一合理的答复是：无论这一次和前两次的美国飞机的轰炸扫射，都是美国空军的预谋，所谓雷达的侦察不过是一个被任意歪曲的藉口罢了。
    李奇微总部想装模作样用这一次的“坦白”来掩饰以前历次的抵赖，这是不可能成功的。相反，这只能证明以前两次轰炸扫射开城中立区和以前多次侵犯开城中立区上空的飞机，无一不是美国空军的飞机。正因为这样，尽管美国雷达侦知了飞机的存在，美国空军才能够置之不问。
