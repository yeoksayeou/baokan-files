    Vigorously Develop Broadcasting Work Among Workers
    Radio broadcasting has entered the lives of our country's working people. It is conducting propaganda and education work on a huge scale. This is a major victory on our country's cultural front.
    Since the News Administration issued the "Decision on Establishing a Radio Network" in April last year, the connection between China's People's Broadcasting and the urban and rural working people has improved significantly. In the past year or so, 15,200 radio stations and listening groups have been established across the country, including 2,254 in small towns. It is estimated that every county has a radio station, except for a few counties in the southwest. There are currently 14,260 radio operators in the country, 866 counties have published blackboards, and 458 counties have published mimeographed newspapers. In the past year or so, about 2,000 wired broadcasting stations have been established across the country, about 1,000 of which are in factories. From March to May of this year, all broadcasting stations across the country, on the basis of the above, held 89 anti-US aggression and aid Korea and suppression of counter-revolution broadcast conferences and recorded broadcasts, with 36 million listeners. They received more than 2.8 billion yuan in donations and other cash and in-kind items, as well as more than 100,000 telephone calls and letters.
    The impact of the People's Broadcasting on urban working people is particularly significant. Broadcasting in factories, mines, and other enterprises has proven to be a powerful weapon for conducting ideological education, promoting production, and carrying out cultural and recreational activities. Forty-nine People's Broadcasting stations across the country have special employee programs, broadcasting 75 times a day, totaling 41 hours and 15 minutes. In many factories, mines, and enterprises, thousands of employees listen to the radio every day, study, and organize production movements under the influence of broadcasting to achieve the goal of increasing production. Listening to the radio has become an indispensable part of the cultural life of the vast majority of employees. Wired broadcasting stations in factories, mines, and other enterprises have played a huge role in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolution, and in the patriotic labor emulation campaign, and have received attention from all parties. During this period, the number of wired broadcasting stations in factories increased dramatically. At the end of last year, there were only eight wired broadcasting stations in Shenyang factories, but by August of this year, the number had increased to 96; in Tianjin, there were 73 in January of this year, but by August, the number had increased to 156; in Shanghai, there were 84 in February of this year, but by June, the number had increased to 282. The rapid increase in wired broadcasting stations in factories shows the importance attached to broadcasting by factory leading organs and the urgent need for broadcasting by employees.
    However, just as the development of China's People's Broadcasting has not yet met the requirements of the vast majority of Chinese people, the development of factory radio networks has not yet met the requirements of the vast majority of employees and the needs of the production movement. As the leading class of the country, a large number of the working class still do not have listening equipment and cannot hear the radio. The radio network has not yet been universally established in all factories, mines, and other enterprises; some of those that have been established have not been effectively managed and utilized; there are still many large and small problems in the organization, leadership, and daily work of factory radio networks. All of these problems urgently need to be solved. In order to further develop worker broadcasting work, so as to further improve the class consciousness of workers and promote the production movement, the "Decision on Establishing a Radio Network in Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" jointly issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the News Administration is indeed a timely and significant measure. Trade unions at all levels and local People's Broadcasting stations should regard the implementation of the above decision as the current political task.
    In the past year or so, various places have had several important experiences in establishing factory radio networks. In order to implement the above decision, these experiences are worth paying attention to.
    First, is the issue of the main tasks of wired broadcasting stations in factories, mines, and enterprises. Experience has shown that wired broadcasting stations that simply broadcast administrative and trade union announcements and simply rebroadcast programs from local People's Broadcasting stations have all failed. The task of factory wired broadcasting stations should be to organize various broadcasting programs, cooperate with the production, learning, and cultural and recreational activities of the unit, complete the specific tasks assigned by the administrative authorities, and rebroadcast programs related to employees from the People's Broadcasting station, with the organization of their own programs as the main focus. Factory broadcasting programs should be closely combined with the production tasks of the unit and the current ideological situation of the employees, and use various forms, such as production news and production good news, current affairs explanations and reading newspapers, as well as technical lectures, health knowledge, and literary and artistic programs to carry out propaganda and mobilization. In the labor emulation campaign, broadcasting should directly play a role in mobilizing and guiding, closely cooperate with production tasks, comprehensively reflect production conditions, promptly introduce advanced experiences and conduct criticism and commendation, and can organize labor models from the factory and activists from various tasks to make broadcast speeches. The timing of factory broadcasting programs should be fixed as much as possible according to the opinions of leaders and the masses; the form should be as short, popular and lively as possible. Allegro, crosstalk, dialogues and other literary and artistic forms are the most suitable and popular for workers who have finished their intense labor.
    Second, the factory wired broadcasting station should have a certain organizational structure and working system, should be presided over by a special person, should establish listening groups and communication groups among the employees, and closely cooperate with various propaganda organizations and cultural and entertainment organizations in the unit, especially to obtain the support of party propagandists in the unit. Experience has shown that wired broadcasting stations that do this have achieved success, otherwise they will not be able to persist. Worker broadcasting is the worker's own business and must rely on the workers themselves to do it. It is necessary to do a good job of mobilization. First of all, the employees must be mobilized, and then followed by arduous and meticulous organizational work, and attention should be paid to constantly absorbing the opinions of the masses to improve their programs, so as to consolidate and develop the radio organization. If workers are not active in listening and contributing, worker broadcasting will not be able to persist.
    Third, factory wired broadcasting stations that have received the support of the trade union and the local People's Broadcasting station have developed, otherwise, they will encounter various difficulties. Trade unions in various places should pay attention to this work and should regularly discuss and periodically check factory broadcasting work. The cultural and educational departments of trade unions should regard broadcasting work as one of the most important tasks. People's Broadcasting stations in various cities should regard doing a good job of worker broadcasting as their most important task at present. For this purpose, they should transfer capable cadres to help factories, mines, and enterprises establish radio networks and solve the difficulties they encounter in terms of technology and equipment; they should run worker broadcasting training classes to train worker broadcasting cadres (in this regard, Shanghai Station has achieved very good results); they should improve and strengthen their employee programs. In large cities such as Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin, when conditions permit, specialized worker broadcasting stations should also be established, and a worker broadcasting committee should be jointly established with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the major industrial trade unions.
    The implementation of the "Decision on Establishing a Radio Network in Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" will inevitably greatly contribute to strengthening worker education, improving worker awareness, and inspiring worker production enthusiasm, and these are necessary conditions for consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship and establishing a strong national defense force and economic force. The Party committees in all factories must pay attention to this work. In units that have not yet established a radio network, they should establish it as much as possible through the trade union and administrative departments; in units that have already established it, they should strengthen its leadership, such as assigning capable cadres to participate in the work, formulating and reviewing the principles and content of broadcasting propaganda, and periodically studying and checking its work, and promptly summarizing its experience.

    大力开展工人中的广播工作
    无线电广播已走进我国劳动人民的生活中。它正进行着巨大规模的宣传教育工作。这是我国文化战线上一个重大的胜利。
    自从去年四月新闻总署发布“关于建立广播收音网的决定”之后，我国人民广播事业与城乡劳动人民的联系，即有了显著的改进。一年多来，全国已设立了一万五千二百个收音站和收听小组，内中小城镇的二千二百五十四个，估计除西南少数县份外，已可作到每县均有收音站。全国现有收音员一万四千二百六十人，有八百六十六个县出了黑板报，四百五十八个县出了油印报。全国一年多来又设立了约二千座有线广播台，内工厂的约一千座。本年三月至五月间，全国各广播台，就在上述的基础上，举行了关于抗美援朝镇压反革命的广播大会和录音广播八十九次，听众三千六百万人，收到捐款二十八亿余元和其他现金实物等多件，电话信函十余万件。
    人民广播事业对城市劳动人民的影响，尤其显著，广播在工厂、矿山和其他企业中，已经证明是进行思想教育、推动生产和开展文化娱乐的有力武器之一。全国有四十九个人民台办了专门的职工节目，每天播音七十五次，共四十一小时十五分。在许多工厂、矿山、企业中，每天有成千成万的职工收听广播，进行学习，并在广播影响下组织生产运动，达到提高生产的目的。收听广播已成为广大职工文化生活中不可缺少的一部分。工厂、矿山和其他企业中的有线广播台，在抗美援朝镇压反革命和爱国主义劳动竞赛运动中，都发挥了巨大作用，受到了各方的重视。在这期间，工厂有线广播台有了惊人的增加。沈阳工厂有线广播台去年年底仅八座，今年八月已增加到九十六座；天津今年一月为七十三座，八月已增加到一百五十六座；上海本年二月为八十四座，六月即增加到二百八十二座。工厂有线广播台的迅速增加，说明工厂领导机关对广播的重视和职工对广播要求的迫切。
    但是，正如中国人民广播事业的发展远没有满足中国广大人民的要求一样，工厂广播收音网的发展，也远没有满足广大职工的要求与生产运动的需要。作为国家领导阶级的工人阶级，现在还有很大数量的一部分人没有收听设备，不能听到广播。广播收音网还没有普遍地在所有的工厂、矿山和其他企业中建立起来；已建立起来的，又有一部分还没有有效地加以管理与利用；工厂广播收音网的组织、领导和日常工作还存在着许多大小的问题，所有这些都是迫切需要解决的。为着进一步开展工人广播工作，以便更进一步地提高工人的阶级觉悟和推进生产运动，中华全国总工会与新闻总署联合发布的“关于在全国工厂、矿山、企业中建立广播收音网的决定”，确实是一个及时的有重要意义的措施。各级工会和各地人民广播电台，应该把实行上述决定，作为当前的政治任务。
    一年多来，各地在建立工厂广播收音网过程中，有过几个重要的经验。为着贯彻上述决定，这几个经验是值得注意的。
    第一、是关于工厂、矿山、企业中的有线广播台的主要任务的问题。经验证明了，凡是单纯播送行政、工会方面的文告，单纯转播当地人民台的节目的有线广播台，都遭到失败。工厂有线广播台的任务，应该是组织各种广播节目，配合本单位的生产、学习、文化娱乐的进行，完成行政当局交付的特定工作，并转播人民广播电台与职工有关的节目，而以组织自己节目为主。工厂广播节目，应密切结合本单位的生产任务和职工当前的思想情况，利用各种形式，如生产消息与生产捷报，时事讲解与读报，以及技术讲座、卫生常识、文艺节目等进行宣传鼓动。在劳动竞赛中，广播应直接地起鼓动与指导作用，紧密地配合生产任务，全面地反映生产情况，及时地介绍先进经验和进行批评表扬，并可组织本厂劳动模范，及各种工作的积极分子作广播讲话。工厂广播节目的时间应尽可能根据领导与群众的意见加以固定；形式应尽量做到短小、通俗和生动，快板、相声、对话等文艺形式，对那些做完了紧张劳动的工人是最合宜最受欢迎的。
    第二、工厂有线广播台应有一定的组织机构和工作制度，应有专人主持，应在职工中成立收听小组与通讯小组，和本单位的各种宣传组织、文娱组织互相配合密切合作，特别是取得本单位中的党的宣传员的支持。经验证明了，凡是这样做的有线广播台都获得成绩，否则就无法坚持。工人广播是工人自己的事情，必须依靠工人自己去做。必须做好动员工作。首先是把职工发动起来，而后继以艰苦细致的组织工作，并注意不断地吸收群众的意见以改进自己的节目，以巩固和发展收音组织。工人收听和投稿不积极，工人广播就不可能坚持下去。
    第三、工厂有线广播台凡是得到工会和当地人民广播电台的支持的，就得到发展，否则，就会遇到种种的困难。各地工会应该重视这一工作，应经常讨论定期检查工厂广播工作。工会文教部门，应将广播收音工作，作为重要工作之一。各城市人民广播电台应把办好工人广播作为当前最主要的任务，为此应抽调得力干部，帮助工厂、矿山、企业建立广播收音网，解决他们在技术和器材方面遇到的困难；应开办工人广播训练班，培养工人广播干部（在这一方面，上海台已获得很好的成绩）；应提高和加强他们的职工节目。在上海、沈阳、天津等大城市，当条件具备时，还应该设立专门的工人广播台，并与市总工会和各主要产业工会，共同成立工人广播委员会。
    “关于在全国工厂、矿山、企业中建立广播收音网的决定”的贯彻执行，必然大大有利于加强工人教育，提高工人觉悟，和鼓舞工人生产热情，而这些正是巩固与发展人民民主专政，建立强大国防力量与经济力量的必要条件。各工厂中共党委，必须重视这一工作。在还没有建立广播收音网的单位，应尽可能地通过工会和行政部门把它建立起来；在已建立了的单位，应加强其领导，如配备得力干部参加工作，制订与审查广播宣传的方针与内容，和定期研究检查它的工作，及时总结它的经验。
