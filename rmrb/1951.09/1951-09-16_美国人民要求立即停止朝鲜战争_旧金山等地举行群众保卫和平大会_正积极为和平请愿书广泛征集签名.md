Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 11th (TASS): The "American Peace Crusade" organization announced that its headquarters has received many messages from all over the country, proving that the movement demanding an immediate end to the Korean War has gained widespread response among the American people.

San Francisco recently held a grand mass rally to preserve peace. Prominent West Coast lawyer Harry Bridges and black community leader Ms. Clark gave speeches at the meeting. A campaign to widely collect signatures for peace petitions is also underway there. Similar movements have been carried out or are underway in Baltimore (Maryland), Detroit (Michigan), and Milwaukee (Wisconsin). In Louisville (Kentucky), the local people launched a movement to distribute postcards to Truman among the masses, demanding an immediate end to military operations in Korea. Many people signed these postcards and sent them to Truman. In Salem (Oregon), 1,000 open letters to Lie were distributed, demanding a ban on war propaganda.

The "American Peace Crusade" organization also announced that it has received many letters from all over the country, describing that rural residents are equally concerned about the movement demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and are actively participating in this movement.
