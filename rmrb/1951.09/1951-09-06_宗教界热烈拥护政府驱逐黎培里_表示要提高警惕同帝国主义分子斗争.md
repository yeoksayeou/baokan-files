Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 5th: Patriotic Catholics and Christians, along with people from all walks of life in Nanjing, warmly support the Nanjing Military Control Commission's wise measure to permanently expel Riberi from our country.

On the 4th, when the Nanjing Public Security Bureau was carrying out the Military Control Commission's order to expel Riberi, patriotic Catholics in Nanjing were holding a meeting to organize the preparatory committee for the Nanjing Catholic Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement Promotion Association. When they heard the news, everyone was overjoyed and unanimously cheered that the government had removed the heavy stone weighing on their heads, clearing a major obstacle for the future Three-Self Reform Movement. Li Weiguang, Acting Bishop of the Nanjing Catholic Diocese, told reporters: "The government has removed this big stone for us, clearing a stumbling block for our Three-Self Reform Movement. We are truly overjoyed." He pointed out that the reason why the Catholic reform movement in various dioceses could not be carried out quickly was mainly because this stone of Riberi was pressing down on the believers, preventing them from turning over. He believes that Riberi's crimes of sheltering spies and engaging in espionage activities are the actions of imperialist elements and not the actions of a Catholic "Shepherd." On the afternoon of the 5th, patriotic Catholics held a forum where everyone agreed that this was a great victory in the anti-imperialist struggle of Catholics. Sun Chifang and Wang Hao, members of the preparatory committee for the Catholic Promotion Association, said that Riberi was an imperialist spy and a bully within the Catholic Church. The government's expulsion of Riberi removed a great harm for us and dealt a heavy blow to imperialism. Everyone deeply felt the greatness and lovability of the motherland from this event. Catholic Li Rulin pointed out that this was a major turning point for Catholics in the past century. In the past, we always kowtowed when we saw foreigners, but now we have driven out such a leading imperialist element. This shows that the Chinese people have truly stood up. Li Ruose, a believer who had been deprived of his right to religious activities by Riberi's henchman Tang Huimin, was even more excited. He said that only after the imperialist elements are driven away can believers have true freedom of belief. He also exposed Riberi's crime of instructing imperialist elements of the former "Loving Infant Home" to sell Chinese children. In addition, everyone pointed out that although Riberi has been driven away, we must still be vigilant against imperialist elements hidden within the church and resolutely carry out the Three-Self Reform Movement. The meeting also resolved to write a letter to Chairman Mao to express their respect. To celebrate this great victory, Catholics are actively preparing to hold a celebration parade on the 6th.

Christians throughout the city also supported the Nanjing Military Control Commission's order to expel Riberi with great excitement. The Nanjing Christian Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement Promotion Committee issued a written statement that day, stating that Christians throughout the city are determined to unite closely with patriotic Catholics and continue to eliminate the remaining forces and influence of imperialism within the church. Heads of various Christian organizations also expressed their opinions, unanimously stating that this is not only a victory for the Catholic anti-imperialist struggle, but also a victory for Christianity. Shao Jingsan, General Secretary of the China Christian Council, Cheng Zhiyi, President of Jinling Theological Seminary, Zheng Ruquan, General Secretary of the YWCA, and others all stated that they must take active actions under the leadership of the Communist Party to sever all ties with imperialism.

Workers, peasants, women, youth students, and cultural figures in Nanjing gathered on the 5th to support the government's removal of harm for the people and to support the patriotic movement of Catholics.

Local organizations of various democratic parties jointly issued a statement supporting the People's Government's just measures to expel the imperialist element Riberi, believing that this fully meets the demands of the Chinese people.

Shanghai Religious Circles Believe that the Expulsion of Riberi is a Great Encouragement to the Patriotic Movement of Believers

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 5th: Shanghai religious circles warmly support the Nanjing Military Control Commission's legitimate measure to order the permanent expulsion of Riberi from the country. Hu Wenyao, President of Aurora University and a Catholic, said that this matter is a great encouragement to the patriotic movement of believers. We extremely support the fair handling of the Nanjing Military Control Commission. Hu Wenyao said that imperialist elements will again falsely claim that "religious persecution" has arrived. I hope that believers will not blindly believe them, because what the Nanjing Military Control Commission expelled was an imperialist element, not a Shepherd. I hope that our Chinese clergy will awaken as soon as possible, no longer be deceived by imperialist elements, and work together with the people of the whole country to strive to safeguard national security and world peace. Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Christian Resist America, Aid Korea, Three-Self Reform Movement Committee, said that Riberi, wearing a religious cloak, engaged in espionage activities in our country. This event fully proves how insidious and vicious imperialism is in using religion as a pretext to carry out aggression against our country. Today, the exposure of Riberi's crimes and the Nanjing Military Control Commission's just handling of him should be a powerful lesson for Catholics and Christians throughout the country. This matter deepens our understanding of imperialism, raises our vigilance against imperialism, and thoroughly eliminates the forces and influence of imperialism within Catholicism and Christianity.

Tianjin Patriotic Catholics and Christians Believe that a Major Obstacle to the Reform Movement has been Removed

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 5th: Patriotic Catholics and Christians in Tianjin warmly support the Nanjing Military Control Commission's measures to permanently expel the imperialist element Riberi. The city's Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association held a forum for Chinese priests and believers. Wu Kezhai, Director of the Association, pointed out in his speech that all the criminal activities of imperialist elements within Tianjin Catholicism were carried out under the instructions of Riberi. As early as 1947, Riberi came to Tianjin and gave imperialist elements within Tianjin Catholicism a plan for reactionary activities. In 1948, he again instructed the imperialist element Wen Guibin to organize the "Legion of Mary" reactionary organization. After the liberation of Tianjin, he continued to actively instruct and fund the "Legion of Mary" to carry out sabotage activities. Catholics in Tianjin have continuously held accusation meetings for a month, demanding that Riberi be expelled from the country. The measures of the Nanjing Military Control Commission fully meet the requirements of the vast number of Catholics in Tianjin. Wu Kezhai also called on Catholics throughout the city to be more vigilant in the future, continue to fight against imperialism and its running dogs, and thoroughly realize the Three-Self Reform Movement. Zhao Zhenya, Acting Bishop of the Tianjin Catholic Diocese, expressed his full support for the measures of the Nanjing Military Control Commission and expressed his gratitude to the government. Father Zhang Jizhong said that Riberi repeatedly undermined our reform movement. This time, the government expelled him, removing a major obstacle to the reform movement! Father Ma Wenbin said that Riberi came to Tianjin in 1947 to "inspect." Chinese priests asked him to reorganize church affairs, but he refused to meet with Chinese priests and held secret meetings with imperialist elements every day. At that time, I was very strange. It turned out that he was not here to handle church affairs, but to carry out reactionary activities. Priests Shi Daohong, Li Depei, Xu Zhiyuan, Sun Junde, Wang Xier, Liu Yagu, Wang Sixian, Luo Luyi, Fu Xinglin, Yue Shude, Zhang Bendu, Miao Yinchuan, Du Bingyi, Li Shouqian, Wang Zongyu, and others spoke one after another, unanimously supporting the permanent expulsion of Riberi. Wu Jiansheng, a professor at Tianjin University, Fan Enkun, Principal of Sacred Heart Girls' High School, and teachers and students from schools such as Fahan and the attached high school of Tianjin University also expressed their opinions, supporting the expulsion of Riberi. Trainees of the Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association held a forum, unanimously supporting the measures of the Nanjing Military Control Commission.

Huo Peixiu, a Christian pastor in Tianjin, and Yang Xiaopeng, General Secretary of the Tianjin YMCA, unanimously pointed out that the correct measures of the Nanjing Military Control Commission have strengthened everyone's courage to fight against imperialism. Everyone must resolutely eliminate the imperialist elements hidden within Christianity.

Beijing Catholic North Church District Reform Committee Represents 3,000 Believers in Support of Government Measures

This newspaper reports: The Reform Committee of the North Church District of the Chinese Catholic Church in Beijing recently issued a written opinion on behalf of more than 3,000 Catholics in the district, supporting the Nanjing Military Control Commission's order to expel the imperialist element Riberi from the country. The written opinion is as follows:

Yesterday (the 5th), we learned from the newspaper that the Nanjing Military Control Commission had expelled the loyal running dog of American imperialism, the head of the imperialist spies wearing a religious cloak, Riberi, from the country. We were very excited after seeing this news. Several months ago, the broad masses of the people across the country and our patriotic Catholic believers signed petitions demanding that the government expel this imperialist spy chief. Now, our request has been fulfilled. The villain Riberi has been permanently expelled from the country by our People's Government. This is another serious blow to the American imperialists. It is also another great victory for our Three-Self Reform Movement.

For a hundred years, we Catholics have suffered from the oppression and anesthetization of imperialists, and we have been unable to catch our breath. In the process of more than two years after liberation, through learning and personal experience, our awareness has gradually increased, we have distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, we have recognized the greatness and lovability of the motherland, and we have seen the ugly face of imperialism, which has increased our hatred for imperialism. However, just as our patriotic Catholics launched the Three-Self Reform Movement, the imperialist element Riberi and his running dogs dared to openly obstruct and sabotage this movement, and colluded with the running dog Madi Nuo to carry out anti-communist and anti-people sabotage activities. This is absolutely intolerable to every patriotic Catholic. We believe that the Nanjing Military Control Commission's judgment to expel Riberi from the country is the minimum punishment that our People's Government should give to this imperialist running dog.

Riberi is chased away, and our Three-Self Reform Patriotic Movement has achieved initial victory. This does not mean that all the imperialist elements and their running dogs in our Catholic Church have been completely eliminated. Facts have proved that the imperialist elements and their running dogs lurking in various dioceses will not stop their sabotage activities because of Riberi's expulsion. In the future, we must work harder to learn, improve our political level, always be vigilant, and learn from the struggle against Riberi, strengthen organization, unite closely, and further eliminate all imperialist elements and their forces and influence within the church. We represent more than 3,000 believers in the North Church District and guarantee to continue to struggle for the thorough completion of the Three-Self Reform Patriotic Movement, and respond to all the calls of the government with practical actions to complete the great task of resisting America and aiding Korea.

    宗教界热烈拥护政府驱逐黎培里
    表示要提高警惕同帝国主义分子斗争
    南京天主教和基督教教徒认为这是反帝斗争的胜利
    【新华社南京五日电】南京市爱国天主教徒、基督教徒和各界人民，热烈拥护南京市军事管制委员会将黎培里永远驱逐出我国国境的英明措施。
    四日南京市公安局执行军管会驱逐黎培里命令时，南京市爱国天主教徒正开会组织天主教三自革新运动促进会筹备委员会。当他们听到这一消息后，大家都欣喜若狂，一致欢呼政府替他们搬掉了压在头上的大石头，为今后三自革新运动扫除了一个大障碍。天主教南京区代理主教李维光对记者说：“政府替我们把这块大石头搬掉了，就为我们三自革新运动清除了一个绊脚石，我们真是万分高兴。”他指出：各教区的天主教革新运动之所以不能迅速开展，主要是黎培里这块石头压在教徒头上不能翻身。他认为：黎培里掩护间谍分子，进行间谍活动的罪恶，是帝国主义分子，根本不是天主教的“神长”。五日下午，爱国天主教徒举行了座谈会，大家都认为这是天主教徒反帝斗争的伟大胜利。天主教促进会筹备委员会孙持芳、汪皓等都说：黎培里是帝国主义的间谍，是天主教内的恶霸，政府驱逐了黎培里，就是为我们除了一个大害，而对于帝国主义却是一个沉重的打击。大家都从这件事情中，深深体会到祖国的伟大可爱，教徒李汝霖指出：这是近百年来天主教徒的一次大翻身。过去我们见到外国人总是叩头，现在却把这样的头号帝国主义分子赶出去了，这就说明我们中国人民真正翻身了。曾经被黎培里指使其走狗唐惠民剥夺宗教活动权利的教徒李若瑟更加兴奋，他说：只有把帝国主义分子赶走以后，教徒才有真正的信仰自由。他并揭露了黎培里指使前“慈爱育婴院”帝国主义分子出卖中国儿童的罪恶。此外，大家并指出：黎培里虽然被赶走了，但还要警惕隐藏在教会内部的帝国主义分子，坚决搞好三自革新运动。会上并决议上书毛主席致敬。为了庆祝这一伟大胜利，天主教徒们正积极准备六日召开庆祝游行大会。
    全市基督教徒亦以万分兴奋的心情，拥护南京市军管会驱逐黎培里的命令。南京市基督教三自革新运动促进委员会当天发表书面声明称：全市基督教徒决与爱国天主教徒紧密团结，继续清除教会内的帝国主义残余力量和影响。基督教各团体负责人亦纷纷发表意见一致表示这不但是天主教反帝斗争的胜利，也是基督教的胜利。中华基督会总干事邵镜三、金陵神学院院长诚质怡、女青年会总干事郑汝铨等都表示：一定要在共产党领导下，采取积极行动，割断与帝国主义的一切联系。
    南京市工人、农民、妇女、青年学生和文化界人士均于五日集会，拥护政府为民除害，支援天主教徒的爱国运动。
    各民主党派地方组织联合发表声明，拥护人民政府驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里的正义措施，认为这完全符合中国人民的要求。
    上海宗教界认为驱逐黎培里对教徒爱国运动是一大鼓励
   【新华社上海五日电】上海宗教界热烈拥护南京市军事管制委员会下令永远驱逐黎培里出国境的正当措施。震旦大学校长天主教徒胡文耀说，这件事对于教友爱国主义运动，是一个很大的鼓励。我们极端拥护南京军管会的公正处理。胡文耀说，帝国主义分子又将妄说“教难”来了，我希望教友不要盲目听信，因为南京军管会所驱逐的是一个帝国主义分子，不是驱逐一位神长。我希望我国籍神长们及早觉悟，不再受帝国主义分子的欺蒙，与全国人民共同努力，为保卫祖国安全、世界和平而奋斗。中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新委员会筹备会主席吴耀宗说，黎培里披着宗教外衣，在我国进行间谍活动，这一事件充分证明了帝国主义是如何阴险毒辣地假借宗教名义，对我国进行侵略。今天黎培里的罪行的揭发，和南京市军管会对他的正义处理，应当是对全国天主教徒和基督教徒一个有力的教训。这件事使我们加深对帝国主义的认识，提高对帝国主义的警惕，澈底地肃清帝国主义在天主教和基督教内的势力和影响。
    津爱国天主教徒和基督教徒认为排除了革新运动大障碍
   【新华社天津五日电】天津市爱国的天主教徒和基督教徒，热烈拥护南京市军管会永远驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里的措施。该市天主教革新运动促进会召开了中国神甫教徒座谈会。该会主任委员吴克斋在讲话中指出：天津天主教内帝国主义分子的一切罪恶活动，都是在黎培里指示下干出来的。早在一九四七年，黎培里就曾经来天津，给天津天主教内的帝国主义分子布置反动活动的计划。一九四八年他又指示帝国主义分子文贵宾组织“圣母军”反动组织。天津解放后，他继续积极指示并资助“圣母军”进行破坏活动。天津市天主教徒一个月来曾不断召开控诉会，要求把黎培里驱逐出境。南京市军管会的措施，完全符合天津广大教徒的要求。吴克斋并号召全市教徒今后要更加提高警惕，继续和帝国主义及其走狗做斗争，澈底实现三自革新运动。天主教天津教区代理主教赵振亚表示完全拥护南京市军管会的措施，并向政府表示感谢。张济众神甫说：黎培里一再破坏我们的革新运动，这次政府把他驱逐了，排除了革新运动的一大障碍！马文斌神甫说：一九四七年黎培里曾到天津来“视察”，中国神甫要求他整理一下教务，他却拒绝接见中国神甫，天天和帝国主义分子举行秘密集会。当时我很奇怪。原来他不是来办教务，是来进行反动活动的。石道宏、李德培、徐志远、孙峻德、王洗耳、刘亚古、王思贤、罗鲁易、傅兴霖、岳树德、张本笃、苗印川、杜秉彝、李守谦、王宗禹等神甫纷纷发言，一致拥护永远驱逐黎培里。津沽大学教授吴健生、圣功女中校长范恩锟及法汉、津沽附中等学校师生，也纷纷表示意见，拥护驱逐黎培里。天主教革新运动促进会学习班学员举行了座谈会，一致拥护南京军管会的措施。
    天津市基督教牧师霍培修、天津市基督教青年会总干事杨肖彭一致指出：南京市军管会这一正确措施，更加强了大家对帝国主义斗争的勇气，大家要坚决肃清隐蔽在基督教内的帝国主义分子。
    京天主教北堂区革新委员会代表三千教徒拥护政府措施
    【本报讯】北京市中国天主教北堂区革新委员会顷代表该区三千余天主教徒发表书面意见，拥护南京市军管会下令驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里出国境。书面意见如下：
    昨天（五日）我们从报纸上知道了南京市军管会已将美帝国主义的忠实走狗，披着宗教外衣的帝国主义间谍头子黎培里驱逐出国境。我们看到了这个消息后万分兴奋。好几个月以前，全国广大人民和我们天主教爱国的教友就纷纷签名要求政府把这个帝国主义的间谍头子驱逐出去，现在，我们的要求已经实现了。黎培里这个坏蛋被我们的人民政府永远驱逐出国境去了。这对于美帝国主义者是又一次严重的打击。也是我们三自革新运动的又一次伟大的胜利。
    百年来我们天主教徒遭受帝国主义者的压迫和麻醉，一直是喘不过这口气来。在解放后二年多的过程中，我们经过了学习及亲身的体会，觉悟逐步提高了，分清了敌我，认识了祖国的伟大和可爱，并看清楚了帝国主义的丑恶面目，增加了我们对帝国主义的仇视。但是，正当我们爱国的天主教徒展开了三自革新运动之际，帝国主义分子黎培里及其走狗竟敢公然阻挠与破坏这个运动，并串通走狗马迪懦进行反共反人民的破坏活动。这是每一个爱国的天主教徒绝对不能容忍的。我们认为：南京军管会将黎培里驱逐出国境的判决，是我们人民政府对这个帝国主义走狗的起码应有的处罚。
    黎培里是叫我们撵走了，我们的三自革新爱国运动得到了初步胜利，这并不等于我们天主教内的帝国主义分子及其走狗们全部肃清，事实证明，潜伏在各教区的帝国主义分子及其走狗也并不会因为黎培里的驱逐而停止他们的破坏活动。今后我们更要努力学习，提高我们的政治水平，时时加以警惕，更要从反对黎培里的斗争中取得经验教训，加强组织，紧密团结，更进一步的肃清教内的一切帝国主义分子及其势力和影响。我们代表北堂区三千多教友，保证为澈底完成三自革新爱国运动而继续奋斗，并以实际行动来响应政府一切号召，完成抗美援朝的伟大任务。
