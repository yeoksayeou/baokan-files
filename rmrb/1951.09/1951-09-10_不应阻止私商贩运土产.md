    Private Merchants Should Not Be Prevented from Transporting Native Products
    In many counties of the Nanzheng Special District in Shaanxi Province, trade companies restrict private merchants from purchasing native products and arbitrarily raise prices, which seriously violates the policy of free domestic trade. Since the Nanzheng Special District vigorously purchased and sold native products and carried out urban-rural material exchange this spring, the trade companies and cooperatives in various counties have actively purchased native products, which is correct. However, they have not played the role that state-owned trade companies should play in leading and uniting the vast number of private merchants to complete the task of urban-rural material exchange, but have adopted the method of打击(dǎjī) or restricting private merchants, which is wrong. For example, some trade companies, in order to compete with private merchants in purchasing, do not hesitate to破坏(pòhuài) the state's price policy and raise prices. More seriously, some county industry and commerce sections do not approve 行商(xíngshāng) going to the countryside to purchase native products, or approve them to go to places where they cannot buy goods. Some, although approved to go to the countryside, are subject to various restrictions from trade companies. Some public procurement units even directly interfere with and prevent private merchants from transporting and selling native products. These are all undesirable phenomena.
    This shows that some cadres in the industry and commerce administrative departments and state-owned trade departments still lack a correct understanding of the policy of free domestic trade; they do not understand that state-owned trade organizations should lead and encourage private capital to invest in commercial activities in urban-rural exchange, because today's state-owned trade and cooperative organizations are far behind the needs of the people. Taking the purchase of native products as an example, there are many types of native products, the areas are wide, and the quantities are large, so it is very important to organize private merchants to purchase and sell native products. State-owned trade organizations should never打击(dǎjī) legitimate private merchants from a price point of view, or restrict the legitimate activities of private merchants from an administrative management point of view; they should encourage private merchants to carry out urban-rural material exchange work everywhere.

    不应阻止私商贩运土产
    陕西省南郑专区许多县的贸易公司，限制私商收购土产，任意抬高价格，严重地违反了国内贸易自由的政策。该专区自今春大力购销土产，开展城乡物资交流工作以来，各县贸易公司与合作社积极收购土产，这是正确的。但是，他们没有起到国营贸易公司应有的领导与团结广大私商完成城乡物资交流任务的作用，而是采取打击或者限制私商的办法，这是错误的。如有些贸易公司为了与私商竞争收购，不惜破坏国家的价格政策，抬高价格。更严重的，有的县工商科不批准行商下乡收购土产，或者给批准到买不到货的地方去。有的虽批准下乡了，但又受到贸易公司的多种限制。有的公营采购单位，甚至直接干涉和阻止私商运销土产。这都是不应有的现象。
    这就表示：某些工商行政部门及国营贸易部门的干部至今对国内贸易自由政策仍缺乏正确了解；他们不了解国营贸易机构应领导与鼓励私人资本投向城乡交流的商业活动中去，因为今天的国营贸易与合作社的机构设置远赶不上人民的需要。即以收购土产来说，土产的种类多，地区广，数量多，组织私商购销土产是很重要的。国营贸易机构决不应该从价格上打击正当私商，从行政管理上限制私商的正当活动；应该处处鼓励私商进行城乡物资交流的工作。
