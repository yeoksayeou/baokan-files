Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd—In its Arctic invasion base in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, American imperialism has incorporated 85,000 Japanese officers and soldiers into the US military for military training. It is now preparing to transport one million Japanese to Alaska under the guise of "immigration" to replenish the region's war-preparedness manpower.

According to a dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency in Ottawa on September 10th: American officers arriving in Canada from Alaska revealed that over 85,000 Japanese officers and soldiers are being used as part of the American military and are undergoing military training in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. These Japanese officers and soldiers are Japanese prisoners of war captured by the US military in Burma, Malaya, Vietnam, Java, Sumatra, and other islands north of Australia in 1944 and 1945. At the end of 1946, the American military authorities sent them to Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, where some were used to build airfields, roads, and other military facilities for the US military. Several thousand others were used as experimental subjects for gas and germ weapons. Their fate is unknown to outsiders. After launching the war of aggression against Korea, the United States incorporated these Japanese prisoners of war into the US paratrooper and Marine Corps units in the region and are now being trained at US Air Force and Naval bases. According to the American officer who revealed the information, these trained Japanese officers and soldiers are closely monitored by the US military police and are not allowed to communicate with the outside world. Some Japanese prisoners of war attempted to escape unsuccessfully and were sent to military court; there has been no news since.

Another report from the Hong Kong reactionary newspaper "Observatory" on August 10th from Tokyo revealed: "The Japanese government is currently planning to immigrate one million people to Alaska." It is said that this move is related to the "Japanese provision of manpower" clause in the secret provisions of the rumored "US-Japan military agreement." The report stated: "Not long ago, the State Department in Washington suddenly sent two advisors, Dutton and Griffoth, to Japan, ostensibly to inspect Japanese agriculture and forestry, but in reality, they held secret consultations with the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese government. After they returned to the United States, the Allied Headquarters Natural Resources Bureau notified the Japanese government that Japan could immediately prepare for immigration to Alaska." The report also stated: "In the past, American defense in Alaska focused on strengthening air force bases. Due to manpower limitations, the army has generally been quite empty. This time, Japan is transferring a large amount of manpower, which indicates that Alaska has obtained what it lacked."

    在北极侵略基地阿拉斯加和阿留申群岛
    美帝国主义积极利用日军备战
    并打算把百万日本人民运送阿拉斯加供美军驱使
     【新华社二十二日讯】美国已在北极侵略基地中的阿拉斯加及阿留申群岛将为数八万五千名的日本官兵编入美国军队实行军事训练，现更准备以“移民”为掩护运送一百万日本人前往阿拉斯加充实该地的备战人力。
    据电通社渥太华九月十日电：由阿拉斯加抵加拿大的美国军官透露：现有八万五千余名日本官兵被作为美国军队的一部分，在阿拉斯加及阿留申群岛受军事训练。这些日本官兵系一九四四年及一九四五年美军在缅甸、马来亚、越南、爪哇、苏门答腊以及澳大利亚以北的其他岛屿俘获的日本军俘虏。一九四六年末美国军事当局把他们送到阿拉斯加及阿留申群岛，一部分被用来为美军修建飞机场、公路及其他军事设备。另数千人则被用来作为瓦斯武器及细菌武器的实验物，他们的命运如何，外人不得而知。美国在发动侵朝战争之后，就将这些日本战俘编入该地区的美军伞兵队及海军陆战队，现在正在美国空军和海军基地受训练。据透露消息的美国军官称：这些受训的日本官兵由美国军事警察严加监视，不得与外界通信；有些日本战俘试图逃跑未遂被送军事法庭，迄无消息。
    另据香港反动报纸“天文台”报八月十日东京消息透露：“目前日本政府计划移民一百万到阿拉斯加去。”据说此举与传说中的“美日军事协定”秘密条款中“日本提供人力”一项规定有关。消息称：不久以前，“华盛顿国务院突然派了达顿、格里福两名顾问到日本，表面上说是视察日本的农林，实际上与盟军总部及日本政府有所密商。当他们回美之后，盟军总部天然资源局便通知日本政府说：日本可即准备移民阿拉斯加”。消息又称：“在阿拉斯加，美国过去的防务是着重空军基地的增强，陆军方面由于人力限制，一般说来是相当空虚的；这次日本移去大量人力，正表示阿拉斯加得到了它缺乏的东西。”
