    Impressions and Thoughts on Visiting China
    Yuan Donggen, Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China
    People's China, bravely advancing at the forefront of the Asian people's national liberation movement and a powerful link in the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, is forcefully striking at the US imperialist policy of aggression in the Far East.
    Just two years ago, the imperialists still dreamed of turning China into their eternal commodity market; however, today's China is no longer the old China under the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, at the mercy of imperialist aggression. Today's China is a new China, vigorously moving towards prosperity and strength under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and implementing the people's democratic dictatorship.
    The 475 million Chinese people, united under the banner of the great Mao Zedong, have firmly grasped political power in their own hands and are powerfully safeguarding Far Eastern security and world lasting peace. The lofty patriotism and indomitable fighting spirit of the Chinese people are infinitely moving.
    During our 44-day visit to China, the Korean People's Delegation personally experienced the immense power of our unity. The Chinese brothers, holding high the righteous banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland," displayed a high degree of patriotism and internationalism in this nationwide movement that is beyond description. The limitless power displayed by the Chinese brothers in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has made every comrade in our delegation proud.
    Today, the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland" movement, which is unfolding vigorously throughout China, is a manifestation of the patriotic spirit erupting from the heart of every person. This movement shows the Chinese people's infinite trust and support for their leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. The Chinese working people, living under a new era and a new system, have launched an even more enthusiastic patriotic production struggle through the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland movement. We saw this everywhere.
    The Shanghai Bicycle Factory used to produce 400 bicycles per month. After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, it produced 1,000 bicycles per month, and now it can produce 1,700. Workers in state-owned enterprises in the Northeast are launching a great mass movement to increase production and save wealth equal to 5 million tons of grain for the country.
    Chinese peasants, who have become masters of the land, are organizing mutual aid teams and fighting for increased production, and they have achieved great success. In particular, when we heard that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan had longed for for more than 40 years, would be completed in a short period of time, we once again felt how enormous the patriotic strength of the Chinese working people dedicated to the motherland is.
    For the sake of the economic development and the strengthening of the national defense of their motherland, the Chinese working people are striving for the fruits of their labor in accordance with the specific patriotic pledges made in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. At the same time, the Chinese working people, displaying patriotism in their labor struggle, are constantly and voluntarily going to the Korean battlefield to aid the just war of the Korean people. This is extremely moving to me. An old man in Songjiang Province, who was 53 years old, volunteered to enlist in the Volunteer Army, but was not approved because of his age. The next day, he shaved off his beard and finally came to the Korean front. Now, the Chinese brothers all consider it a supreme honor to come to the Korean battlefield, and they are rushing to demand to go to the front line of Resist America, Aid Korea. What particularly impressed us was the love of the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers for their motherland. They unanimously said: The enemy of the Korean people is the enemy of the Chinese people, and the enemy of the people of the whole world. Today, the Korean people are suffering the pain we once suffered. Since we understand this, how can we stand by and watch? My son, my husband, my daughter, are all doing what they should do. When we heard these words, the blood in our hearts seemed to boil like molten iron.
    Not only that, but today's Chinese people have a high degree of political awareness. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, they are victoriously carrying out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and land reform movements. The high political consciousness of the Chinese people can be seen from the following examples: the Chinese people, regardless of men, women, old or young, automatically participate in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries with high vigilance. Promoting the economic development of the motherland and strengthening the national defense, the Chinese people, with the heroic posture of peace fighters, are enthusiastically launching a signature campaign to demand the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers and oppose the rearmament of Japan. Today, the Chinese people believe that it is their infinite glory to dedicate their creative labor and wisdom wholeheartedly to the motherland in all departments, including politics, economics, and culture. The Chinese people have also shown their internationalism in the struggle to defend peace. In a word, we have gained such confidence from the current struggle of the Chinese people, who have taken political power into their own hands: the strength of the unity between our two peoples of Korea and China is rapidly strengthening. The power of this unity is a link in the powerful and invincible strength of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union.
    Now, we are returning to our motherland full of even stronger confidence in the victory of the war against America. We will report to all the Korean people in detail everything we have seen and experienced in China. We will convey to the Korean people the friendship given to us by the Chinese people, so as to further strengthen the unity between the two peoples of Korea and China and promote the victory of our common struggle.
    Our two peoples of Korea and China have had deep brotherly friendship forged with blood. Our two countries are connected by a border. When Japanese imperialism rampantly invaded the mainland, we united and achieved victory. Today, we are fighting side by side in the struggle against America, striving for a more glorious victory. However, the enemy is cunning. It has not yet bowed its head to us, and the enemy is frantically creating more cruel atrocities. We Korean people want to tell our Chinese brothers: we are encouraged by your glorious victories in the struggle to strengthen national defense and the high degree of patriotism and internationalism with which you have vigorously participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. We vow to wage a more courageous struggle for our final victory. The mad enemy, with bombs, poison gas, and germ warfare, cannot weaken our indomitable fighting will. We must learn from your example of overthrowing foreign imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary bandits and building a people's China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. We must overthrow US imperialism, defend the independence of our motherland, and contribute to the cause of maintaining Asian security and world peace, to repay the Chinese people for their assistance to us. We must win victory and become a model for oppressed nations to oppose the heinous imperialist aggression and strive for national independence and freedom.
    As we are about to welcome the glorious second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we would like to extend our warm congratulations and respect to the Chinese brothers and their wise leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, who are closely united under the banner of the great Mao Zedong. Let us further strengthen the invincible force formed by the Korean and Chinese people in the victorious advance of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, and eliminate the aggressors!

    访问中国的印象与感想
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长  元东根
    站在亚洲人民的民族解放运动最前列英勇前进的人民中国，作为以苏联为首的和平民主阵营有力的一环，正有力地打击着美帝国主义对远东的侵略政策。
    仅仅在两年以前，帝国主义者还梦想变中国为其永远的商品市场；然而，今天的中国已不是任凭帝国主义侵略的蒋介石国民党反动统治下的旧中国了。今天的中国，乃是在以伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党领导下生气勃勃地迈向富强繁荣道路，实行人民民主专政的新中国。
    在伟大的毛泽东的旗帜下团结一致的四亿七千五百万中国人民，已经把政权坚强地掌握在自己的手中，有力地保卫着远东安全与世界持久和平。中国人民的崇高的爱国主义热忱与不屈不挠的斗争精神，令人无限感动。
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团在访问中国的四十四天中，亲自体会到我们团结起来的力量是何等巨大。高举着“抗美援朝保家卫国”的正义旗帜的中国兄弟们，在这一全民性的运动中所发挥的高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神，是无法用言语来形容的。中国兄弟们在抗美援朝运动中所发挥出来的无限的力量，使得我们代表团的每一个同志都感到骄傲。
    今天，在全中国如火如荼地展开着的“抗美援朝保家卫国”运动，是从每一个人的心脏里迸发出来的爱国主义精神的表现。这一运动显示了中国人民对自己领袖毛泽东主席的无限信赖与拥戴。生活在新时代、新制度下的中国劳动人民，通过抗美援朝保家卫国运动，更加热烈地展开了爱国主义生产斗争。我们到处都看到了这一点。
    上海自行车工厂过去每月生产四百辆自行车，抗美援朝运动展开后，每月就生产一千辆，现在已经能够生产一千七百辆了。东北国营企业的工人们正在展开伟大的群众运动，为国家增产与节约价值等于五百万吨粮食的财富。
    业已成为土地的主人的中国农民，纷纷组织互助组，为增产而斗争，他们已获得了巨大的成就。特别是当我们听说四川人民渴望了四十余年的成（成都）渝（重庆）铁路的敷设工程，在短时期内即将竣工时，使我们再一次感到中国劳动人民献给祖国的爱国主义力量是多么巨大。
    为了自己祖国的经济发展和国防力量的加强，中国劳动人民正按照在抗美援朝运动中所订立的具体的爱国公约，争取劳动的成果。同时在劳动斗争中发挥着爱国主义精神的中国劳动人民，不断地自愿到朝鲜战场来，援助朝鲜人民的正义战争。这一点使我极为感动。松江省一个年已五十三岁的老人自愿要求报名参加志愿军，但因为年老而未被批准。第二天，他就剃光了胡须，终于到朝鲜前线来了。现在，中国的兄弟们都认为到朝鲜战场来是无上的光荣，都争先恐后地要求上抗美援朝的前线。特别给我们以深刻印象的，是中国人民志愿军家属对自己祖国的热爱。他们一致说：朝鲜人民的仇敌就是中国人民的仇敌，也就是全世界人民的仇敌。今天，朝鲜人民正遭受着我们曾经遭受过的痛苦，我们既然了解这一点，怎么能袖手旁观呢？我的儿子、我的丈夫、我的女儿，都做着应该做的事情。当我们听到这话时，我们的心胸里的血液就好像熔铁液似地沸腾着。
    不仅如此，今天的中国人民在政治上已有了高度的觉悟。他们在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，胜利地进行着镇压反革命和土地改革运动。中国人民政治觉悟之高，从下列实例中就可以看出：中国人民不分男女老幼，都以高度的警惕性自动参加镇压反革命运动。促进着祖国的经济发展和加强国防力量的中国人民，更以和平斗士的雄姿，热烈地展开了要求五大国缔结和平公约和反对重新武装日本的签名投票运动。今天，中国人民认为在政治、经济、文化等各部门，把自己创造性的劳动和智慧热诚地献给祖国，是自己无限的光荣。中国人民在保卫和平的斗争中又显示了他们的国际主义精神。一句话，我们从把政权掌握在自己手中的中国人民目前的斗争中，得到了这样的自信心：我们朝中两国人民的团结力量，正在急遽地加强着。这一团结的威力，是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的强大无比的力量的一环。
    现在，我们满怀着更加强烈的对抗美战争的胜利信心回到祖国了。我们将向全朝鲜人民详细地报告我们在中国所看到、所体验到的一切事情。我们将向朝鲜人民传达中国人民给予我们的友情，以进一步加强朝中两国人民的团结，促进我们共同斗争的胜利。
    我们朝中两国人民本来就有着用鲜血结成的兄弟般的深厚友谊。我们两国的国境相连。在日本帝国主义猖狂地侵犯大陆时，我们就曾经团结起来，取得了胜利。今天，我们在抗美斗争中并肩作战，正在争取着更光辉的胜利。但是，敌人是狡猾的。它还没有向我们低头，敌人正在疯狂地制造着更残酷的暴行。我们朝鲜人民要告诉中国的兄弟们：我们为你们在加强国防力量的斗争中所取得的光辉胜利和有力地奋起参加抗美援朝运动的那种高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神所鼓舞。我们宣誓：要为我们的最后胜利，进行更勇敢的斗争。疯狂的敌人用炸弹、毒瓦斯和细菌武器，都不能削弱我们不屈不挠的斗争意志。我们要学习你们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下打倒外来帝国主义和蒋介石反动匪帮、建设人民中国的榜样。我们要打倒美帝国主义，保卫祖国的独立，以之贡献于维护亚洲安全与世界和平的事业，报答中国人民对我们的援助。我们一定要争取胜利，要成为被压迫民族反对凶恶的帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立自由的模范。
    当即将迎接光荣的中华人民共和国成立二周年的时候，我们谨向紧紧地团结在伟大的毛泽东旗帜下的中国兄弟及其英明的领袖毛泽东主席，致以热烈的祝贺和敬意。让我们在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的胜利行进中，进一步加强朝中两国人民结成的不可战胜的力量，消灭侵略者！（新华社）
