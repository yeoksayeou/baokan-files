Fuqing Township Work Team Cadre Cong Ruike of Anxi County, Fujian Province
Interfered with Marriage Freedom and Forced Two People to Death
The Government Sentenced Him to Five Years in Prison According to Law

Cong Ruike, a cadre of the Fuqing Township Work Team in Anxi County, Fujian Province, seriously violated the Marriage Law, interfered with the freedom of marriage, and forced two people to death. He has been sentenced to five years in prison.

Guan Bairen, a resident of Fuqing Township, was 32 years old and made a living by peddling. After his wife died, he was left with two children who were difficult to care for, which often affected his production. Chen ?, a widow, was 24 years old this year, of poor peasant background, and lived in the same residential group as him. The two often helped and cared for each other, and gradually developed feelings. They had requested to register for marriage with the district chief, who agreed. However, some cadres and masses had strong feudal ideas and hindered this matter. They thought of going to the district to register their marriage three times, but the head of the residential group refused to issue a letter of introduction. Later, it was delayed by the busy farming season.

In May of this year, work cadre Cong Ruike went to work in the countryside and learned about this situation. Not only did he not help them solve this problem, but he also convened a meeting of township cadres to discuss so-called "punishment methods." Township cadres suggested that Guan Bairen and Chen ? should make a public apology and write a letter of repentance. Cong Ruike said that their love affair was serious and that they were "big idlers," and proposed two ways to deal with it: one was to make them wear two-and-a-half-foot-high paper hats with the words "idlers" written on them and parade through the streets, with Chen ? beating a gong and Guan Bairen confessing his mistakes; the other was to make them wear two-and-a-half-foot-high paper hats with the words "idlers" written on them and clean the entire township. They were to choose one of these two methods and were required to examine themselves and report on their ideological situation every day before the execution. The two of them had to break off relations immediately.

Chen ? refused to accept these two methods. Cong Ruike came up with another method, requiring them to push down two large stone pillars. These two large stone pillars were very heavy and required one or twenty people to push them down. Chen ? knew that this method was even more impossible to complete, so she requested that they be allowed to "admit their mistakes" in public and then be allowed to marry. Cong Ruike refused. Chen ? left in disappointment and sighed, "Then I have no choice but to die!" So, she and Guan Bairen went to the mountains to collect poisonous herbs to prepare for suicide.

Seeing that several attempts to deal with the situation had been ineffective, Cong Ruike summoned Chen ? on May 16 to parade through the streets. Chen ? falsely claimed that her mother-in-law was ill, ran away, and told Guan Bairen about the situation. Guan Bairen was plowing the fields and, upon hearing this, agreed to commit suicide with Chen ?.

In the evening, Cong Ruike convened a township cadre meeting in the name of "anti-idlers." Although Guan Bairen was not a cadre, he was also called to the meeting. Guan Bairen was afraid and left the meeting before it was over. After returning, the two felt that they were in a dilemma and had no way out, so they both took the poison heartbreak grass on the same night to commit suicide. After the masses discovered it, they wanted to give emergency treatment, but Chen ? was already dead. Guan Bairen also refused to take the antidote, saying it was "too late." On the verge of death, he told the surrounding masses: "If there are any fair working comrades in the future, please tell them that we were forced to commit suicide."

After Guan Bairen and Chen ? committed suicide, the masses were very dissatisfied with Cong Ruike's illegal actions. The County People's Government and the Jinjiang Prefectural Office, together with the Jinjiang Prefectural Office of the Preparatory Committee of the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, went to investigate and proved that the situation was true. According to Article 26 of Chapter 8 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China and the instructions of the East China Military and Political Committee on conscientiously implementing the New Marriage Law, the Provincial People's Court has sentenced Cong Ruike to five years in prison and instructed Anxi County to handle the matter. The Jinjiang Prefectural Office also issued a circular calling on governments at all levels to learn from this lesson, conscientiously publicize and resolutely implement the Marriage Law.

Jia Xiangju, a Woman from Yuanjiacun, Eighth District, Qihe County
Forced to Commit Suicide Due to Abuse by Her Mother-in-Law and Husband
The District Government Did Not Handle This Case

Jia Xiangju, a woman from Yuanjiacun, Yuanjia Township, Eighth District, Qihe County, Shandong Province, was forced to hang herself on September 3 because she could not bear the abuse of her mother-in-law and husband. Before her suicide, she had complained to the township and village governments about the abuse she suffered, but did not receive the protection she deserved. After her suicide, the district government only buried the body and did not investigate the matter.

Jia Xiangju was 18 years old. In 1949, she was married to Hao Maozhi by her father's arrangement. Hao Maozhi's father was a counter-revolutionary who did all kinds of evil, and he was executed by the People's Government a few months after Jia Xiangju's marriage. Hao Maozhi's mother, Hao Wei, complained that her daughter-in-law had "bad luck" and often found excuses to beat and scold her. Hao Maozhi was a hooligan who had a mistress outside and often beat and scolded Jia Xiangju. Jia Xiangju suffered greatly and became ill. In June of this year, she returned to her parents' home to recuperate. She lived in her parents' home for two months and returned to her husband's home on August 30. Hao Wei blamed her for staying at her parents' home for too long and, on the pretext that a ring was lost (actually stolen by Hao Maozhi to give to his mistress), allowed her son Hao Maozhi to beat Jia Xiangju severely, leaving her with injuries all over her body. After being beaten, Jia Xiangju asked the township government to resolve the matter, but to no avail. Village cadre Wei Yunshang (Hao Wei's nephew) also reprimanded Jia Xiangju, saying, "You are the daughter-in-law of the Hao family and should obey the Hao family's discipline. Otherwise, you can go hang yourself..." Jia Xiangju felt that there was no way out, so she hanged herself to death on the morning of September 3.

After the incident occurred, the township reported to the district government. After sending someone to understand the situation, the district government only buried Jia Xiangju's body, but did not pursue the matter. District cadre Feng Jinsheng even said to those who requested that the case be handled: "She deserved to die, this is nothing." The murderers, Hao Wei and her son, are still at large. The masses are very dissatisfied with this. Jia Yanmei, a woman from Dadaicun in the district, said: "The government often holds meetings, saying that men and women are equal and marriage is free, but now they don't care at all when a woman is forced to death!"

In order to resolutely implement the Marriage Law, the County People's Government should immediately handle this matter to educate the cadres and masses of the county and reverse the bad influence.

Xu Wengao, Deputy Township Chief of Gongbei Township, Huai'an County
Violated the Marriage Law and Abused His Wife Xu Guihua
Editor:
The Marriage Law has been promulgated for more than a year, but some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the Marriage Law and continue to do things that seriously violate the Marriage Law. This is a noteworthy situation. Now we are telling you about Xu Wengao, the deputy township chief of Gongbei Township, Yanbei District, Huai'an County, Subei, who abused his wife Xu Guihua.

Xu Guihua is the director of the Women's Federation of Gongbei Township. She often participates in social activities. Xu Wengao is very dissatisfied with her because of this and often beats and scolds her. At the beginning of August this year, Sun Gui, director of the Yanbei District Women's Federation, mobilized Xu Guihua to go to the County to help with the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. After the work was completed, Xu Guihua went home, and Xu Wengao beat her severely. At the end of August, when Xu Wengao went to the district, Sun Gui said to him: "Xu Guihua has a great desire to make progress and has a promising future. You should help her and cultivate her well." When Xu Wengao returned home, he beat Xu Guihua severely again and said, "You still want to make progress? Want to become a cadre? I won't let you go to meetings. Every time you go out, I will beat you. Let's see if you still want to become a cadre!"

Xu Wengao, as a township cadre, has such serious feudal ideas. He still wants to keep women in the kitchen and make them forever appendages of men. His barbarous beating and scolding of women is even more of an illegal act. Cadres should become models for implementing the Marriage Law. Xu Wengao's behavior has a very bad influence among the masses. Therefore, we suggest that the Huai'an County People's Government should stop his illegal behavior and take appropriate action. At the same time, the Huai'an County People's Government should strengthen the publicity and education of the Marriage Law in order to implement it.

Suggest Local People's Publishing Houses
Publish a Large Number of Popular Marriage Law Readers
Editor:
Recently, newspapers in various places have published many materials about women being subjected to various forms of persecution under the feudal marriage system. This shows that widely publicizing the Marriage Law is still a serious issue.

However, the cultural level of the majority of rural cadres and farmers is still very low, making it difficult to study the various documents related to the Marriage Law that have been issued in the past. Therefore, I suggest that local People's Publishing Houses publish a large number of various booklets, using forms that the masses love to see and hear, such as ditties, clapper talks, songs, popular illustrations, flower drums, and dramas, to publicize the Marriage Law on a large scale. In this way, farmers will easily understand it. This can play a great role in the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law. Facts have proven that in the past, in the publicity of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, books in the above-mentioned forms were welcomed by the broad masses of the people and played a great role. For example, the "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishment of Counter-revolutionaries," published by the East China People's Publishing House in May of this year, was welcomed by readers and generally improved the vigilance and political awareness of the masses, achieving great results. It is hoped that local People's Publishing Houses will pay attention to this work.

    深入宣传婚姻法！坚决贯彻婚姻法！
    福建安溪县福春乡工作组干部丛瑞科
    干涉婚姻自由逼死两条人命
    政府依法把他判处徒刑五年
    福建省安溪县福春乡工作组干部丛瑞科，严重违反婚姻法，干涉婚姻自由，逼死两条人命，已被判处徒刑五年。
    福春乡乡民官百忍，三十二岁，靠挑贩为生。其妻死后，留下了两个孩子，无人照顾，常常影响他的生产。寡妇陈?，今年二十四岁，贫农成份，和他同在一个居民小组里。他们两人经常互相帮助，互相照顾，逐渐有了感情。他们曾向区长要求登记结婚，区长也同意了。但部分干部和群众封建思想浓厚，阻碍这件事。他们三次想到区里登记结婚，但居民小组长却不肯打路条。以后又碰上农忙季节，这件事便耽搁下来。
    今年五月间，工作干部丛瑞科下乡工作，了解了这种情况。他不但不帮助他们解决这个问题，反而召开乡干部会议，讨论所谓“处罚办法”。乡干部建议要官百忍、陈?两人当众认错，写悔过书。丛瑞科却说他们两人恋爱问题严重，是“大二流子”，提出了两个处理办法：一个是让他们两人戴二尺半高写有“二流子”的纸帽游街示众，并要陈?打锣，官百忍坦白错误；一个是让他们两人戴了二尺半高写有“二流子”的纸帽，替全乡大扫除。这两个办法让他们自选一项，并让他们两人在执行前天天检讨，汇报思想情况。两人还必须立即断绝关系。
    陈?拒绝接受这两个办法。丛瑞科又想出一个办法，要他们将两根大石柱推倒。这两根大石柱很重，须一、二十人才能推倒。陈?知道这办法更不能完成，便请求让他们当众“认错”，然后允许他们结婚。丛瑞科不允。陈?失望退出，并叹息说：“那我只有去死了！”于是，她和官百忍便到山上采集毒草，准备自杀。
    丛瑞科看见数次处理无效，便于五月十六日把陈?召去游街。陈?假称婆婆生病，逃了出去，并把这种情形告诉官百忍。官百忍正在耕田，听了这件事，便和陈?相约自杀。
    晚上，丛瑞科又以“反二流子”为名召开全乡干部会议。官百忍虽非干部，亦被叫去开会。官百忍害怕，会未开完便退出会场。回去后，两人感到进退两难，无路可走，便于当晚同服断肠草自杀。群众发觉后，欲待急救，陈?已经死了。官百忍亦拒绝吃解毒药，说是“迟了”。临死时，他对周围群众说：“今后如有公正的工作同志来时，请告诉他，我俩是被迫自杀的。”
    官百忍和陈?自杀后，群众对丛瑞科的不法行为很不满。该县人民政府、晋江专署会同省民主妇女联合会筹备会晋江专区办事处前往调查，证明情况属实。省人民法院根据中华人民共和国婚姻法第八章第二十六条的规定及华东军政委员会关于认真贯彻新婚姻法的指示，已判处丛瑞科徒刑五年，指令安溪县办理。晋江专署并发出通报，号召各级政府接受这一教训，认真宣传并坚决贯彻婚姻法。

    齐河县八区袁家庄妇女贾象菊
    不堪婆母丈夫虐待被迫自杀
    该区政府对此案竟不加处理
    山东省齐河县八区袁家乡袁家庄妇女贾象菊，因不堪婆婆及丈夫虐待，在九月三日被迫上吊自杀。她在自杀前，曾向乡、村政府申诉她受虐待的情况，但没有得到应有的保护。她自杀后，区政府只把尸体埋了，并没有追究这件事。
    贾象菊现年十八岁。一九四九年，她在父亲包办下，与郝茂之结婚。郝茂之的父亲是个无恶不作的反革命分子，他在贾象菊结婚数月后，即被人民政府枪决。贾象菊的婆婆郝魏氏就埋怨儿媳“命不好”，经常找借口打她骂她。郝茂之是个流氓，在外有姘妇，也经常打骂贾象菊。贾象菊饱受蹂躏，积累成病，于今年六月间回娘家养病。她在娘家住了两个月，于八月三十日回婆家。郝魏氏嫌她住娘家时间长了，藉口丢了一个戒指（实际上是郝茂之偷去送给姘妇了），纵使其子郝茂之把贾象菊毒打一顿，打得贾象菊全身是伤。贾象菊被打后，就向乡政府要求解决这件事，但无结果。村干部魏允胜
    （郝魏氏的侄子）并训斥贾象菊说：“你是郝家的儿媳，应该服郝家管教。要不，你去吊死……。”贾象菊感到没有路走，就在九月三日上午自缢而死。
    事件发生后，该乡即报告区政府。区政府派员了解了一些情况后，仅把贾象菊的尸首埋了，但并未追究此事。区干部冯金声竟对要求处理该案的人说：“她自己该死，这个算不得什么。”凶手郝家母子至今仍逍遥法外。群众对此很不满。该区大代村妇女贾延美说：“政府经常开会，说什么男女平等、婚姻自由，现在妇女被逼死了全不管！”
    为了坚决贯彻婚姻法，该县人民政府应立即处理这件事，以教育全县干部群众，挽回不良影响。

    淮安县拱北乡副乡长许文高
    违反婚姻法虐待妻子许桂华编辑同志：
    婚姻法颁布已经一年多了，但某些干部对婚姻法还没有足够的认识，还不断做出一些严重违犯婚姻法的事情。这是一个值得注意的情况。现在我们把苏北淮安县盐北区拱北乡副乡长许文高虐待他妻子许桂华的事情告诉你们。
    许桂华是拱北乡妇女联合会主任。她时常参加社会活动。许文高因此对她很不满意，经常打骂她。今年八月初，盐北区妇女联合会主任孙桂同志动员许桂华到县里帮助做拥军优属工作。工作结束后，许桂华回家，许文高就将她毒打一顿。八月底许文高到区时，孙桂向他说：“许桂华很有进步要求，有培养前途，将来可以参加工作。你要很好帮助她，培养她。”许文高回到家里，又狠狠地打了许桂华一顿，并说：“你还想进步？想当干部？我就不让你去开会。你出去一回，我就要打你一回。看你还想当干部不？”
    许文高身为乡干部，竟有这样严重的封建思想。他还想把妇女关在厨房里，永远做男子的附属物。他蛮横地打骂妇女，更是一种违法行为。干部应当成为执行婚姻法的模范。许文高这种行为，在群众中的影响是很坏的。因此，我们建议淮安县人民政府应制止他这种违法行为，并应进行适当的处理。同时，淮安县人民政府应加强婚姻法的宣传教育，以便贯彻执行婚姻法。
    青年团苏北淮安县委员会黄培干、徐飞
    建议各地人民出版社
    大量出版婚姻法通俗读物编辑同志：
    最近各地报纸刊载了许多关于妇女在封建婚姻制度下遭到各种迫害的材料。这说明广泛宣传婚姻法还是一个严重的问题。
    但目前广大农村干部和农民的文化水平还很低，很难学习过去所出各种有关婚姻法的文件。因此，我建议各地人民出版社大量出版各种小册子，以小调、快板、歌谣、通俗图解、花鼓、话剧等群众喜闻乐见的形式，大规模宣传婚姻法。这样，农民就容易看懂了。这对婚姻法的宣传和贯彻，可以起很大作用。事实证明：过去在抗美援朝和镇压反革命的宣传中，上述形式的书籍都受到了广大人民的欢迎，起了很大作用。譬如今年五月华东人民出版社的一本“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例图解通俗本”，就受到读者的欢迎，普遍提高了群众的警惕性和政治认识，收到了很大效果。希望各地人民出版社重视这个工作。
