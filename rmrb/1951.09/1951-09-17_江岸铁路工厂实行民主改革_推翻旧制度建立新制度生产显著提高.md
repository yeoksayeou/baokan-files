The Jiang'an Railway Factory of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration has achieved significant results by carrying out democratic reforms in conjunction with production and the implementation of economic accounting.

This factory began preparing for the implementation of economic accounting in April of this year, before the democratic reforms. However, because the remnants of feudal forces in the factory had not been thoroughly eliminated, bad elements were secretly active, dampening workers' enthusiasm for production and suppressing their creativity. For example, when worker Fan Zhongzhi invented a pipe cutting machine, bad elements directly told him, "No matter how you invent, it won't be as good as the American one!" They threw the machine he invented outside and never used it. Fan Zhongzhi suffered such a serious blow that he dared to be angry but didn't dare to speak out. During the trial implementation of economic accounting, the shortcomings of the factory's production management system were also exposed. For example, work responsibilities were not clear, coordination between units was insufficient, and there was often a phenomenon of mutual buck-passing. Some employees had the mindset of "work when there's work, wait when there's no work." Therefore, in May of this year, the factory decided to conduct a supplementary democratic reform in conjunction with production and the implementation of economic accounting.

    **Establishing a New System in the Democratic Reform**

During the democratic reform movement, the factory crushed the remnants of feudal forces, and the enthusiasm of the workers for production was unprecedentedly high. They urgently demanded improvement of the management system. The factory decided to carry out democratic reform in conjunction with the establishment of a new management system. For example, in the forging workshop, the system of division of labor and responsibility for cadres was implemented during the democratic reform, freeing the workshop director, who used to be busy all day long, from the circle of事務主義 [事務主義:roughly translated as "事務 ism", with 事務 meaning routine administrative or clerical work, and the implication that one is getting bogged down in it]. After the implementation of the mechanical responsibility system in each workshop, the workers cherished the machines as they cherished their own lives. Old worker Yu Yongxiang said, "The steam hammer is my lifeline, and I must protect it well to prevent it from being sabotaged by special agents." Before using the steam hammer at work, the workers would carefully check it. The oil sludge on the steam hammer, which no one had bothered with for years, was wiped off. The steam hammer used to often break down, but now it doesn't. The workers said, "The steam hammer is much younger!"

Before the democratic reform, the factory had conducted time-study work, but because the workers in the forging and wheel workshops had not treated this work with a sense of ownership, they were afraid that if the working hours were determined, the work would be too tight, and it would not be beneficial to them, so the time-study work was difficult to carry out. In the democratic reform movement, the workers' political awareness continued to improve, and they realized that time-study was a necessary task for the implementation of economic accounting, and it was beneficial to both the country and individuals. Because the masses of workers consciously participated in this work, it made this work proceed smoothly. When the preliminary time-study was carried out, the factory had 13,268 pieces of work in July, setting a new record. This played a great role in accurately determining the working hours.

The factory widely promoted the job responsibility system, the shift handover system, and the inspection responsibility system in the democratic reform movement, thus ensuring the good quality of the products. For example, the scrap rate of forgings dropped from 35% to 2%. In order to reverse the phenomena of "waiting for work," "rework," and waste of working hours, the mechanical and locomotive workshops, in particular, signed liaison contracts with relevant units and established new management systems such as three-person mutual aid groups and workshop director coordination meetings. Therefore, the work of the mechanical and locomotive factories has made new progress. The time for repairing locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars has been shortened.

    **Democratic Reform Makes Production Leap Forward Continuously**

The factory's employees were encouraged by the political emancipation in the democratic reform movement, and they gave full play to their initiative and creativity. The entire factory did not affect production because the democratic reform took up some production time. On the contrary, production made significant progress. On the basis of the masses having been mobilized, the factory put forward the slogan "Strive to implement economic accounting," and each workshop established accounting organizations that independently calculated costs, which further stimulated production and strengthened the cost concept of employees. In the upsurge of democratic reform, the entire factory promoted movements against material waste, working hour waste, and defective products. The mechanical workshop mobilized the masses to inspect toolboxes, and each team in the workshop handed in surplus tools and cotton and grease sufficient for two months. Each workshop also paid attention to the use of waste materials: the boiler workshop used waste pipes to manufacture more than 2,300 kilograms of welding rods in August alone. The foundry used 30% of copper scrap in each furnace opening. The mechanical workshop accumulated more than 4,800 kilograms of copper scrap in July. Each workshop also implemented assembly line operation methods, strengthened the connection between units, and tightened the operation procedures, so that the production tasks were overfulfilled. In May, the factory only completed 85.7% of its locomotive task. In the democratic reform movement, in June and July, it completed 112.5% each month. In May, the passenger car completion rate was 150%, while in June, it over-fulfilled by 304%. The passenger cars and freight cars that left the factory in June and July could be delivered to the section after one test run. The number of days in the factory and the average working hours per unit of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars have been significantly reduced each month. The material preparation team of the repair shop increased its monthly output from 10,000 sets of screws to 17,000 sets.

In terms of worker invention and innovation, Fan Zhongzhi, who had his invention of a pipe cutting machine suppressed by bad elements in the past, became active again in the democratic reform movement. He created an adjustable tap wrench for threading water pump spouts, which increased work efficiency by 32 times. He also continued to study and improve the pipe cutting machine. Han Xunjie of the forging workshop improved the mold for forging rope shackles, increasing work efficiency by 30%. Workers in the boiler workshop improved the method of electric welding screw stays. Originally, each boiler required 12 hours of work, but now it only takes 9 hours.

    **The Promotion of New Working Methods Has Been Effective**

During the democratic reform movement, the factory timely tested advanced working methods, which played a certain role in production. Since May, it has learned from the advanced working experience of the Ma Hengchang group, and five Ma Hengchang-style groups have emerged. The Ma Hengchang-style Hou Yusheng group in the foundry implemented the job responsibility system and the inspection system, and established a technical research association. As a result, the group has overfulfilled its tasks for four consecutive months. In June, it completed seven furnaces' worth of work with only six furnaces, ensuring that the product quality reached 95% of the standard, becoming a banner for production in the factory. After the Yang Sanbao group in the boiler workshop formed a three-person mutual aid group during the democratic reform, the number of rivets increased from 100 per day by six workers to 252. The Zhou Zunhua group in the locomotive workshop implemented an assembly line operation method, which made it possible to complete three days' worth of work in half a day. Yan Fabin, director of the locomotive workshop, said: "During the democratic reform, the implementation of the assembly line operation method gave me a clear idea of the number of locomotives and guaranteed the date of the locomotive leaving the factory." When the Yu Fushun group of the wheel workshop communicated the learned high-speed cutting method to the factory, some workers believed that the lathes were old and worried that the machine would break down if it ran too fast, and some believed that the work efficiency was higher than before and were satisfied with the status quo, so the high-speed cutting method was not quickly promoted. In the democratic reform movement, the workers' understanding changed, and they hoped to learn advanced working methods.

    **Carry out the Patriotic Increase Production and Donation Movement**

In the democratic reform movement, the employees further realized the aggressive nature of American imperialism, actively responded to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, and proposed "Starting from June, donate one day of voluntary labor each month, and donate all the money to purchase airplanes and cannons until the victory in Korea." The workers encouraged each other: "Produce more and overthrow American imperialism sooner!" The passenger car workshop took the lead in producing an extra passenger car on the voluntary labor day. In order to produce more cars, the locomotive workshop also rushed to repair live parts. On the voluntary labor day on August 26, they rushed to repair a locomotive and sent it off for a test run, and delivered another locomotive to the section after the test run. The amount of donations from the entire factory in June and July reached more than 63.47 million yuan.

    江岸铁路工厂实行民主改革
    推翻旧制度建立新制度生产显著提高
    郑州铁路管理局江岸工厂进行民主改革时，结合着生产和推行经济核算制，已经做出了显著的成绩。
    今年四月，该厂未进行民主改革时，就试行了经济核算制的准备工作。但由于该厂封建残余势力没有澈底肃清，坏分子暗中活动，打击了工人生产情绪，压制了工人的创造性。如工人范忠志发明割管机，坏分子直接向他说：“你怎样发明也不如美国的好！”把他发明的机器丢到场外，始终不用。范忠志受到这样严重的打击，敢怒而不敢说。在试行经济核算制中，该厂生产管理制度的缺点也暴露出来了。如工作责任不明确，各单位联系不够，经常发生互相推诿的现象，有些职工存在着“有活就干，没活就等”的思想。今年五月该厂遂决定结合生产和实行经济核算制，进行民主改革的补课。
    在民主改革中建立新的制度
    在民主改革运动中，该厂打垮了封建残余势力，职工生产情绪空前提高。他们迫切要求改进管理制度。该厂决定把民主改革结合着建立新的管理制度来进行。如锻工场在民主改革中，实行干部分工负责制，使过去成天忙来忙去的场主任，摆脱了事务主义的圈子。各场实行机械负责制后，工人爱护机器，像爱护自己的生命一样。老工人余永祥说：“汽锤是我的命根子，要好好地保护它，免得被特务破坏。”工人上班使用汽锤前，都要仔细检查。几年没有人过问的汽锤上的油泥都擦掉了。从前汽锤常发生故障，现在也不发生了。工人们说：“汽锤又年青多了！”
    在民主改革前，该厂曾进行查定工时工作，但因为锻工和车轮二场的工人还没有以主人翁的态度来对待这一工作，他们害怕查定了工时，工作太紧，对自己没好处，所以查定工时工作很难展开。在民主改革运动中，工人政治觉悟不断提高，已认识到查定工时是实行经济核算制必需的工作，是对于国家和个人都有利益的事情。由于工人群众自觉地参加了这个工作，就使得这个工作顺利地展开了。当查定初步工时时，该厂七月份有一万三千二百六十八件活，创造了新纪录。这样对于正确地查定工时起了很大作用。
    该厂在民主改革运动中广泛地推广作业负责制，交接班制和检查负责制等，因而保证了产品质量的良好。如锻制品废品率，由百分之三十五降到百分之二。为了扭转“等活”、“返工”和浪费工时等现象，以机械、机车二场为主，分别向有关单位，订立了联系合同，并建立了三人互助小组、工长碰头会等新的管理制度。因此机械和机车二厂的工作就有新的进展。修理机车、客车和货车的时间都缩短了。
    民主改革使生产不断跃进
    该厂职工在民主改革运动中，受到政治翻身的鼓舞，发挥了积极性和创造性。全厂并未因民主改革占去一部分生产时间而影响生产，相反的，生产上有了显著的进步。在群众已经发动起来的基础上，该厂提出“为贯彻经济核算制而奋斗”的口号，各场建立了单独计算成本的会计机构，进一步刺激了生产，加强了职工的成本观念。全厂在民主改革的热潮中，推动了反材料浪费、反工时浪费、和反废品等运动。机械场发动群众抽查工具箱，该场各小组均交出了多余的工具和足够二个月用的棉丝和油脂。各场并注意到利用废料：锅炉场于八月份一个月内，用废管子制造了二千三百多公斤焊条。铸工场每次开炉都利用了百分之三十的铜屑。机械场七月份积蓄了铜屑四千八百余公斤。各场并实行流水作业法，加强了各单位的联系，严密了作业的程序，使得生产任务超额完成。该厂五月份机车只完成任务百分之八十五点七，在民主改革运动中，六、七月份，均完成百分之一百一十二点五。五月份客车完成百分之一百五十，而六月份超额完成百分之三百零四。六、七月份出厂的客车和货车，试运一次，就都可交段。机车、客车和货车的在厂日数及每台平均工时，每月均有显著缩减。修配场的制材组，由月产一万套螺丝，达到了月产一万七千套。
    在工人创造发明上，过去发明割管机被坏分子压制的范忠志，在民主改革运动中，又积极起来。他创造了套水泵嘴子丝扣的活动丝锥绞刀，把工作效率提高了三十二倍。他还继续研究改进割管机。锻工场韩勋界改进锻制绳栓的模具，提高工作效率百分之三十。锅炉场工人改进了电焊螺撑头的方法，原来每台锅炉要工作十二小时，现在只要九小时。
    推行新工作方法已经有了成效
    该厂在民主改革运动中，及时地试行先进工作方法，对生产起了一定的作用。从五月份起，学习马恒昌小组的先进工作经验，出现了五个马恒昌式小组。铸工场的马恒昌式的侯雨生小组，实行了作业负责制，和检查制，并成立技术研究会，因此该组连续在四个月中，都超额完成任务，六月份只用六炉就完成七炉的活，保证产品质量达到标准的百分之九十五，成为全厂生产上的旗帜。锅炉场杨三保小组在民主改革中成立三人互助组后，由六个工一天铆一百个钉，增加到二百五十二个。机车场周遵华小组，实行了流水作业法，使得三天的活能在半天内完成。机车场主任阎法斌说：在民主改革中，实行了流水作业法，使我心中有了数，可以保证机车出厂的日期了。”当车轮场于福顺小组将学得的高速切削法向厂内进行传达时，某些工人认为车床老，怕车开快了出毛病，有的认为现在工作效率比从前高，满足现状，以致高速切削法没有很快地推广。在民主改革运动中，工人认识转变，希望学习先进工作方法。
    开展爱国主义增产捐献运动
    在民主改革运动中，职工们进一步认识了美帝国主义的侵略本质，积极响应抗美援朝总会发出的号召，提出“从六月份起，每月义务劳动一日，将所得的钱全部捐献购买飞机大炮，直到朝鲜胜利为止。”工友们互相鼓舞着：“多生产，早打倒美帝国主义！”客车场首先在义务劳动日里多做出一辆客车。机车工场为着多出车，也抢着修复活件，在八月二十六的义务劳动日里，赶修了一台机车出厂试运，并将另一台机车试运后交段。全厂六、七两月捐献数字即达六千三百四十七万余元。
