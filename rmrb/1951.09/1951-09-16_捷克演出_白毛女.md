Czech Performance of "The White Haired Girl"
Zheng Yunqin

The opera "The White Haired Girl" was performed in Ostrava, Moravia, Czech Republic in January of this year. On February 24th, the Czech Military Theater staged it again in Prague, achieving even better results than the first performance in Ostrava. Czech audiences warmly welcomed the drama from New China, because it serves the people and is an art closely integrated with the lives of the people.

When the Military Theater decided to stage this play, they encountered many problems that needed to be solved. First of all, the actors, directors, and stage workers were unfamiliar with Chinese life, and their understanding of the actual situation of the Chinese people's struggle was insufficient. The question before them was how to further understand the past and present heroic struggles of the Chinese people. Before the rehearsal work even started, they selected and read many Chinese novels, news reports, and books on Chinese history, politics, economics, and military affairs, and watched some new Chinese films. These were of great help to them.

The actors also carefully and meticulously studied the stage script to understand the situation of the Chinese countryside and the lives of the peasants at that time. The actress Chalamostova, who played Xi'er, carefully read the Czech translation of the script, deeply experiencing the mental and physical pain Xi'er suffered when her father, Yang Bailao, died from poisoning and she was forced to work as a servant in the Huang family; as well as her resilience and strong personality when she escaped from the Huang family and lived in a cave. Therefore, her portrayal of Xi'er is simple, lovely, and strong.

The Military Theater's production of "The White Haired Girl" did not completely follow the style of Chinese drama; to make it easier for Czech audiences to accept, some parts were staged in the Czech style. The Czech version of "The White Haired Girl" uses the most popular vocabulary in Czech today, avoiding foreign vocabulary. Some dialect parts have been modified.

However, some customs and clothing styles are adopted from China. In this regard, the Chinese Embassy in the Czech Republic provided a lot of assistance during their rehearsal process. For example, the initial design of the actors' costumes adopted the styles of ancient Chinese clothing from hundreds of years ago. After suggestions from the embassy staff, it was changed to modern clothing. In the first scene, Dachun wears the clothes of a farmer from northern China and a white towel on his head; in the later scene, he wears the uniform of the People's Liberation Army. Also, the embassy staff explained the ceremonies of weddings and funerals and other celebrations, the etiquette of treating people in feudal society, and even many details of life, such as the way Chinese people drink tea, the posture of holding wine glasses, and the etiquette of welcoming and seeing off guests, so that they could suit the needs of the plot. In the first scene of the first act, Xi'er celebrates the New Year at home, buys white bread, makes dumplings, and other New Year customs, which were also rehearsed after explanation and modification.

The stage design is also mainly based on Chinese scenery. Miroslav Koli was responsible for the design work, and Aris Pfulsky was responsible for the set construction. They attempted to show the characteristics of China and studied the characteristics of Chinese stage installations. "The White Haired Girl" has some transition scenes that only use two curtains and no scenery, such as Xi'er escaping from the Huang family and Huang Shiren chasing after her. This time, the Military Theater used a revolving stage, which was handled very well.

On the first night of the performance of "The White Haired Girl" at the Czech Military Theater in Prague, the audience included senior Czech government officials, members of the Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party, model soldiers, artists, industrial and agricultural shock workers, and farmers from collective farms. Everyone expressed a warm welcome and love for the play. Czech collective farm farmers used to live in hunger and poverty under the oppression of landlords, so they understood the plot of "The White Haired Girl" the most. After watching "The White Haired Girl," a Slovakian farm woman recalled her past life. She said: "When we lived under the oppression of landlords a few years ago, we were the same as the Chinese peasants shown on the stage." Every time the play reached the last scene, when the peasants on the stage shouted "Long live the Chinese Communist Party," the audience burst into thunderous applause. At the close of the play, the audience stood up together and enthusiastically shouted "Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!" The cheers lasted for a long time.

In the past, the Czech people saw in old Chinese dramas gentle Chinese women with bound feet and high-ranking officials with strong feudal ideas. They had never seen true heroes in Chinese history on the stage. However, the new opera "The White Haired Girl" tells the Czech people about the Chinese people, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, who are engaged in heroic struggles, and their struggle life, which are the points to be emphasized in the future. After the Military Theater performed "The White Haired Girl," the Czech newspapers responded and attached great importance to the performance. "Czech Life" published an article saying: "Today, the role of the performance of 'The White Haired Girl' is even greater. The heroic struggle of the Chinese people has become a struggle to defend world peace. The 'White Haired Girl' staged by the Military Theater in Prague brings the Czech people a sketch of the new life of the Chinese people and provides rich struggle experience, enhancing the deep friendship between the two countries that are jointly fighting for the cause of socialism and striving for world peace." After watching the play, Czech Minister of Education Niedli said: "Watching 'The White Haired Girl' makes us more aware and closer to the struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao." Deputy Minister of Culture and Propaganda Zivoni said: "We can see from this play that the art of New China serves the people and is closely integrated with the lives of the people."

Through continuous cultural exchanges, the people of the two countries have gained a better understanding of each other and enhanced their friendship and unity.

    捷克演出“白毛女”
    郑韵琴
    捷克摩拉维亚州俄斯特拉发城于今年一月间演出中国歌剧“白毛女”，二月二十四日，捷克军人剧院在布拉格又连续上演，比第一次在俄斯特拉发城上演时获得更好的效果。捷克观众热烈欢迎新中国的戏剧，因为它是为人民服务的，而且是和人民生活紧密结合着的艺术。
    当军人剧院决定排演这个戏时，他们遇到了许多必须解决的问题。首先，演员、导演、舞台工作者就不熟悉中国的生活，对于中国人民斗争生活的实际情况的了解，也是不够的。摆在面前的问题是如何进一步了解中国人民过去与今天英勇的斗争生活。在排演工作还未开始时，他们选读了许多中国的小说、通讯报道，以及中国历史、政治、经济、军事方面的书籍，观摩了一些中国新电影。这些对他们有很大的帮助。
    演员也从认真而细心地研读舞台脚本中，去了解当时中国农村的情况和农民的生活。饰演喜儿的演员查拉莫斯托娃精读译成捷语的剧本，深刻体验喜儿当她父亲杨白劳服毒死后，她被迫到黄家当丫头时，精神上与身体上所受到的痛苦；以及她逃出黄家在山洞生活时的坚韧毅力和坚强个性。因此，她饰演的喜儿的形象是朴实可爱，但又是坚强的。
    军人剧院排演“白毛女”并不完全依照中国戏剧的风格；为使捷克观众容易接受，在某些部分是以捷克的风格来排演的。“白毛女”的捷语本在语言方面是采用捷克今天最流行的语汇，避免那些外国的语汇。一些方言部分都修改了。
    但一些风俗习惯以及服装的式样等，是采用中国的。在这一方面，中国驻捷克大使馆在他们排演过程中曾给予不少帮助。譬如最初演员服装的设计，是采用几百年前中国古代衣服的样式，经过大使馆人员建议，就改为现代的服装。大春第一场穿的是中国北方农民的衣服，头上围了白头巾，后一场穿人民解放军的制服。又如杨白劳死后及黄世仁结婚等场面的婚丧喜事的仪式，及封建社会中待人接物的礼节，甚至许多生活细节，如中国人喝茶的方式，拿酒杯的姿势，欢迎客人与送走客人的礼貌等，大使馆人员都加以解释，使能适合剧情的需要。第一幕第一场，喜儿在家过年，买白面包饺子等过年的风俗习惯，也是经过说明、修正，然后才排演出来的。
    舞台设计也是以中国的布景为主。米罗斯拉夫·柯里担任设计工作，亚里斯·普甫尔斯基担任制景工作，他们企图表现出中国的特色，便研究了中国舞台装置的特点。“白毛女”有一些过场戏，只用二道幕，没有布景。如喜儿逃出黄家，黄世仁在追逐的途中等。这次军人剧院上演时是应用旋转舞台，处理得很好。
    “白毛女”在捷克布拉格军人剧院演出的第一天晚上，观众有捷克政府高级官员、捷克共产党中央委员、模范军人、艺术家、工业农业的突击队员及集体农场的农民，大家对这个戏都表示热烈地欢迎与喜爱。捷克集体农场农民以前也是在地主压迫下过着饥饿穷困的生活，因此他们最了解“白毛女”剧中的情节。有一个斯洛伐克农妇看过“白毛女”后，回想起她过去的生活。她说：“几年前我们在地主压迫下生活时，和舞台上所表现的中国农民是一样的。”戏每演到最后一幕时，舞台上的农民高呼“中国共产党万岁”，台下掌声雷动。闭幕时，观众一齐站立起来，热烈高呼中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁。欢呼之声经久不息。
    过去捷克人民从中国旧戏中见到的是缠小脚的恬静的中国妇女，和封建思想浓厚的达官显人，在舞台上没见过中国历史上真正的英雄。但新歌剧“白毛女”告诉捷克人民的是在毛泽东同志领导下进行英勇斗争的中国人民，和他们的斗争生活，这些是今后所要着重表现的。军人剧院演出“白毛女”后，捷克的报刊都有反应，异常重视这个演出。“捷克生活”发表文章说：“在今天看来，‘白毛女’演出的作用更大，中国人民这种英勇的斗争已成为保卫世界和平的斗争了。军人剧院在布拉格上演的‘白毛女’带给捷克人民一幅中国人民新生活的速写，同时提供了丰富的斗争经验，增强这两个共同为社会主义事业及争取世界和平而奋斗的国家的深厚的友谊。”捷克教育部长尼耶德利在观剧后说：“看了‘白毛女’，使我们对中国人民在毛主席领导下所进行的斗争更加了解和接近了。”文化部与宣传部副部长齐佛尼说：“我们从这个剧中看出新中国的艺术是为人民服务而且与人民的生活紧密结合着。”
    通过了不断的文化交流，两个国家的人民得到更多的互相了解，也增强相互间的友谊与团结。
