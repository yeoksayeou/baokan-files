    Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Self-Criticism on Editing "History of the New Democratic Revolution (Study Material)"
    The "Cultural Life" column of the People's Daily on August 16th criticized that the "History of the New Democratic Revolution (Study Material)" published by Xinchao Bookstore in July this year and the "Reference Materials on the History of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution" published by the Commercial Press in April this year were 90 percent identical, essentially one book published twice. This error should be my responsibility, because both books were compiled under my direction. This is an error of individualism and liberalism. Such an error completely loses the serious attitude of a revolutionary theoretical worker, and I should make a profound self-examination of my work style.    Hu Hua

    关于编辑“新民主主义革命的历史（学习资料）”的自我检讨
    人民日报八月十六日“文化生活”栏中，曾批评到今年七月间新潮书店出的“新民主主义革命的历史（学习资料）”与今年四月间商务印书馆出的“中国新民主主义革命史参考资料”，百分之九十雷同，实际上是一书两印。这个错误应由我负责，因为两书都是在我的主持下编出的。这是一种个人主义、自由主义的错误。像这样的错误是完全失去了一个革命理论工作者的认真严肃的态度，我应该对自己的作风作深刻的检讨。    胡华
