Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The valiant resistance of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies has inflicted serious casualties on the U.S. military's adventurous advances. The Associated Press admitted on the 24th that the U.S. military's battle to seize a peak on the eastern front ended in failure after paying a heavy price, so much so that the peak was regarded as "Heartbreak Ridge." The Associated Press stated: on the 23rd, after the first four failed attacks, "the thirteen remaining men of a platoon began a final charge toward the summit. Only three men made it through the Communist mortar and grenade fire blockade" and wearily climbed to the peak of "Heartbreak Ridge." That U.S. battalion "was reduced to three-quarters of its regular strength due to casualties."

However, the peak that the U.S. aggressor forces captured with such heavy casualties was retaken by the Korean People's Army the next day. The Associated Press sadly said: "The highest peak of "Heartbreak Ridge," which U.S. infantry captured after a desperate battle last night, was lost again today to the counterattacking North Korean Communists."

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 26th: Our front-line reporter reports: Disregarding the heavy losses suffered on the eastern front, the U.S. aggressor forces and the Syngman Rhee's puppet army launched another adventurous offensive on the central front, which was also met with a head-on blow by our army. On the 21st, U.S. and Syngman Rhee's forces, with eight battalions of infantry, supported by sixteen aircraft, more than sixty tanks, and more than fifty artillery pieces, fiercely attacked our line of defense, which stretched for twenty-five kilometers from Fangtong-ri northeast of Kimhwa to the west bank of the North Han River. A unit of our army bravely fought back and bombarded the enemy's tanks with fierce artillery fire, causing the enemy heavy losses. A part of our army guarding the high ground south of North Pyong Hill continuously repelled eight charges by two enemy companies under the cover of aircraft and artillery. After repelling three enemy charges, the enemy launched another fierce attack with a battalion force against another high ground defended by one of our units, the unit met them head-on with fierce firepower, the enemy suffered more than a hundred casualties, and immediately fled south in a panic. In the battle on the 21st, a unit of our army annihilated more than one thousand and ninety enemy soldiers and destroyed fifteen enemy tanks. The enemy's fierce attack on the 21st has been repelled by our army. In the area west of Kimhwa, a unit of our army also repelled the enemy's attack under the cover of aircraft and tanks on the 21st, killing or wounding more than one hundred enemy soldiers and destroying two enemy tanks.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The so-called "spearhead attack" by tank units, which the invading U.S. military has recently touted greatly, has suffered another disastrous defeat under the powerful hammering of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. A message reported on the 23rd by Hanson, a reporter for the U.S. United Press who has always touted the U.S. aggressor forces, described the embarrassing situation when a U.S. tank task force on the central Korean front was defeated. He had to admit that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies "were too strong"; in that battle, "the Communist forces bombarded the Allied task force with all kinds of shells for nearly ten hours. Mortars, artillery, anti-tank guns, sniper fire, rocket launchers, and even "Buffalo" anti-tank rifles all bombarded the M-4 Sherman tanks. Several tanks were destroyed, and some people were killed or wounded. The exact number of casualties cannot be revealed."

Hanson's report also exposed a characteristic of the U.S. aggressor forces: extreme arrogance and self-confidence before being attacked and extreme panic after being attacked. Describing the course of that battle, he said: "The tanks crossed the front line at dawn and entered the valley. ... A tank captain said on the radio: 'I see some direct-fire guns, we will hit them hard.' What tank crews fear most is the flat trajectory fire of anti-tank guns. In a moment, a cry of surprise rang out on the radio: 'What's going on?' Not far in front of the lead tank, a fatally wounded M-4 tank spewed orange-red flames and thick smoke from its turret. ... The tanks were blocked and could not advance, and were forced to retreat. We carried out two air attacks, followed by a long artillery bombardment. The tanks moved out again. I waited to see, but the Communist forces remained in their positions. The U.S. military was blocked again and forced to retreat for replenishment."

"The order came: 'Use all the tanks. Use all the artillery and aircraft as much as possible.' The aircraft attacked twice more. Then came the artillery bombardment, and the tanks also participated in the bombardment. It seemed that no part of the Communist fortifications had not been bombarded. But this time, we lost the bet again. The tanks came out for the third time. The tanks were blocked again. Finally, the order came to retreat." Hanson concluded by quoting a U.S. aggressor officer as saying: "Today was a really hard day."

### 朝鲜东线中线敌军冒险进攻遭惨重损失  中线美军吹嘘的坦克部队“劈入战”在我锤击下惨败

    朝鲜东线中线敌军冒险进攻遭惨重损失
    中线美军吹嘘的坦克部队“劈入战”在我锤击下惨败
    【新华社二十六日讯】朝中人民军队的坚强阻击战，予冒险进犯的美军以严重伤亡。美联社二十四日承认：美军在夺取东部前线一个高峰的战斗中，在付出惨重代价后卒以失败而告终，以致该高峰被目为“伤心岭”。美联社称：二十三日，美军“在前四次的进攻失败之后，一排人中全部剩下来的十三个人，开始向山顶进行最后的冲锋。仅仅有三个人冲过共军迫击炮和手榴弹的火力封锁线”。疲惫地爬上了“伤心岭”山峰。该营美军“由于伤亡而减少到正规编制人员的四分之三”。
    但是，美国侵略军以这样大的伤亡才夺到的山峰，在第二天就被朝鲜人民军夺回来了。美联社伤心地说：“美军步兵昨夜经过拼死作战后占领的
    “伤心岭”的最高峰，今日又丢给进行反击的北朝鲜共军了。”
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略军和李伪军不顾在东线遭受的惨重损失，又在中部前线发动冒险进攻，这个进攻同样遭到我军迎头痛击。二十一日，美、李军以八个营的步兵在飞机十六架、战车六十余辆和大炮五十余门的配合下，猛犯我金化东北芳通里到北汉江西岸二十五公里长的一线阵地。我军某部奋勇迎击，并以猛烈炮火轰击敌军战车，使敌军遭受重大损失。扼守在北平岭以南高地的我军一部连续击退敌军两个连在飞机、大炮掩护下的八次冲锋。扼守另一个高地的我军某部击退敌军三次冲锋后，敌军复以一个营兵力猛攻，该部以猛烈火力迎头痛击，敌军伤亡百余名，当即狼狈南逃。在二十一日的战斗中，我军某部共计消灭敌军一千零九十多名，击毁敌战车十五辆。敌军二十一日的猛犯已被我军击退。在金化以西地区，二十一日我军某部也击退敌军在飞机、坦克掩护下的进攻，杀伤敌一百余人，击毁敌战车二辆。
    【新华社二十六日讯】侵朝美军最近大事吹嘘的所谓坦克部队“劈入战”，在朝中人民军队的有力锤击下遭到了又一次的惨败。一向替美国侵略军吹嘘的美国合众社记者韩森二十三日报道的一条消息，曾描述了朝鲜中线美军某坦克特遣部队被击溃时的狼狈相。他不得不承认：朝中人民军队“太强了”；在该次战斗中，“共军以各式各样的炮弹向盟军特遣部队轰击历时几达十小时。迫击炮、大炮、反坦克炮、狙击火力、火箭炮，甚至是“水牛”式反坦克来复枪齐向M——4薛尔曼式坦克轰击。有几辆坦克被击毁了，死伤了一些人。死伤的精确数字不能透露。”
    韩森的报道同时暴露了美国侵略军的一个特点：即在未遭打击前的狂妄自信与在遭到打击后的极度慌乱。他在描述那次战斗的经过时说：“坦克在天明时越过前线进入山谷。……一个坦克队长在无线电里说：“我看到某种直接射击的炮，我们要痛击他们。”坦克手最惧怕的是反坦克炮的平射火力。一忽儿，无线电里大惊地嚷道：“怎么回事？”在领队坦克前面不远的地方，一辆受致命伤的M——4式坦克从它的塔里喷出橙红的火焰和浓密的烟雾。……坦克受阻不能前进，被迫退回了。我方进行了两次空中攻击，随后又进行了长时的炮轰。坦克再次出动。我等着瞧，可是共军仍然留在他们的阵地上。美军再次受阻而被迫后撤整补。”
    “命令来了：‘把所有的坦克用上去。尽可能把所有的大炮和飞机都用上去。’飞机又来攻击了两次。随后就是大炮轰击，坦克也参与轰击。看来好像共军的工事没有一处没有受到轰击。可是，这回又赌输了。坦克第三次出来了。坦克又被阻住了。最后命令来了叫撤退。”韩森最后引美国侵略军的一个军官的话作结说：“今天真是苦日子。”
