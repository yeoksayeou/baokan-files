    Resolutely Oppose the United States Rearming Japan
    Jiang Xueshan, Commander of the "Tashan Hero Regiment" of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    September 3rd is the sixth anniversary of the victory of our country's War of Resistance Against Japan. When I recall the scene six years ago when the Japanese fascists were defeated and surrendered, the joy and excitement of the people and soldiers across the country was beyond description. At that time, the people of Asia and even the whole world who loved peace and freedom were also cheering for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In order to achieve this victory, we shed a lot of blood. I am Jiang Xueshan, the commander of the Tashan Hero Regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and also a veteran of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In thirteen years of combat, I was wounded six times; in the war against Japan, I lost my left eye, and even now there is still a bullet in my left leg bone that cannot be taken out. We will never forget these hatreds!
    As we celebrate the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, American imperialism dares to disregard the opposition of the people of China, Asia, and the world, and convenes a conference in San Francisco to sign a so-called peace treaty with Japan, attempting to forcibly sign a separate peace treaty with Japan, attempting to accelerate the rearming of Japan in an open and "legal" form, and make Japan a tool for American imperialism to carry out aggression in Asia. Today, when I recall the tragic scenes of the heroic sacrifices of many comrades during the eight years of the War of Resistance, my hatred for American imperialism is even more intense. I remember that in the winter of 1942, the Japanese invaders used tens of thousands of troops to carry out a so-called torch blockade and iron-arm encirclement "mopping-up" operation in the Jiaodong area of Shandong. This resulted in the Mashishan Massacre, in which nearly a thousand soldiers and civilians were killed. But the Chinese people will never yield. At that time, my regiment charged back and forth, leading more than 1,800 people out of the enemy's encirclement. Chen Ziying, the former chief of staff of my regiment and a member of the Communist Party, was unfortunately wounded and captured. His heroic and unyielding behavior in front of the enemy is something I will never forget. When the enemy asked him, "Are you an officer of the Eighth Route Army?" he said sternly, "I am not only a commander of the Eighth Route Army, but also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. What can you do to me!" After he finished speaking, he picked up a wooden stick and struck the enemy who was questioning him. His story of generous sacrifice gave our troops new strength. After more than a month of hard work by the military and civilians, we finally smashed this heinous "mopping-up" operation by the enemy. What I cannot forget is the heroic and tragic story of the Shuidao battle in the autumn of 1944. Shuidao was an important stronghold for the enemy to extend southward from Muping City into our Jiaodong base area, blocking the connection between our eastern and western sea areas at that time. The fortifications were high and the trenches were deep, and the defenses were solid. The enemies here often went to the countryside to burn, kill, rape, and plunder, committing all kinds of evil. When the troops heard the news of the suffering people writing to the leaders for help, the passionate desire to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service reached its peak. At that time, I was a company commander. After the battle began, the soldiers I led and all the troops participating in the attack rushed up like tigers. No matter how high the fortifications were, how deep the trenches were, or how fierce the firepower was, it could not thwart our confidence in victory. In the enemy's fire net, the bridge over the trench had just been built when it was broken by the enemy's artillery fire. At this time, the comrades who were building the bridge were anxious and jumped into the waist-deep trench, using their shoulders to carry the broken bridge so that the troops could pass. Then, the assault team opened a gap and stormed into the middle level of the bunker. Because the enemies in the lower level of the bunker had not been eliminated, the stubborn enemies fired wildly at them from above and below. Only six heroes of the assault team were left, but they were still very calm and full of confidence in victory. With a loud bang, they detonated the explosives from inside the bunker, dying together with the enemy. The battle ended in victory, and a small team of Japanese troops was completely annihilated, and six enemies were captured alive. The heroes of the Shuidao battle assault team were outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. Their spirit of daring to sacrifice for the greatest interests of the people will be immortal! It will always give us the greatest strength! Comrades, compatriots, can we not be indignant when we see the shameless behavior of American imperialism in separately concluding peace with Japan and rearming Japan today? We finally won the victory after eight years of hard-fought resistance against Japan. Can we allow American imperialism to rearm Japan and come to harm us again? This kind of conspiracy of American imperialism is something that we Chinese people will never allow.
    American imperialism, determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people, directly directed and aided the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch a large-scale offensive against the Chinese people after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, vainly attempting to seize the fruits of the Chinese people's victory through its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, and replace the Japanese fascists' former position in Asia; but its dream was shattered. The Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, fought heroically, and in the four-year Liberation War, annihilated more than 8 million of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops equipped by American imperialism. The victorious establishment of New China proves that the strength of the Chinese people is invincible. Take the Tashan Hero Regiment that I lead as an example. In the Jinzhou campaign in the autumn of 1948, we responded to the call of the Party, and in order to cut off the enemy's retreat and ensure the complete annihilation of the enemy troops guarding Jinzhou and several other isolated strongholds, the troops turned to the enemy's rear, cut off the main artery of communication between inside and outside the Pass—the Beining Railway, quickly seized Tashan (a small station five or six miles from the sea between Jinxi and Gaoqiao Town), and fought fiercely for six days and nights, repelling the joint offensive of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's naval, land, and air forces. Like a copper wall and iron wall, we blocked the five divisions, seven divisions, and even the twelve divisions that American imperialism sent to Chiang Kai-shek with warships to reinforce Jinzhou, ensuring that the troops completely annihilated the 120,000 enemy troops guarding Jinzhou and captured the enemy corps commander Fan Hanjie alive; as a result, we quickly annihilated all the enemy troops guarding the Northeast, entered the Pass, went south, and cooperated with brother troops across the country to liberate all of China.
    In the four-year Liberation War, we eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, liberated the Chinese mainland, and shattered American imperialism's dream of replacing the Japanese fascists and turning China into its colony; but American imperialism is still not reconciled to its defeat. In June of last year, it launched the war of aggression against Korea, dreaming of first destroying Korea and then attacking the Chinese people and the people of Asia. However, the great victories repeatedly achieved by the Chinese and Korean peoples in the Korean battlefield have shattered its dreams. In addition to expressing our infinite indignation at the despicable behavior of American imperialism in separately concluding peace with Japan, we are determined to take practical actions to support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on August 15. We Chinese people have always advocated peace and have made significant contributions to it; but we are also never afraid of war, and we know what methods to use to strive for and defend peace. If American imperialism dares to provoke a larger-scale war of aggression, it will surely be battered and bloodied and accelerate its own demise!

    坚决反对美国重新武装日本
    中国人民解放军塔山英雄团团长  江雪山
    九月三日是我国抗日战争胜利第六周年纪念日。当回想起六年前日本法西斯被我们打败投降的时候，全国军民欢欣鼓舞的情形是无法用言语形容的。当时亚洲以至全世界爱好和平、自由的人民，也都为抗日的胜利而欢呼。为了取得这个胜利，我们曾流了许多的鲜血。我是中国人民解放军塔山英雄团团长，也是抗日战争中的一个老战士。在十三年的战斗生活中，我负伤六次；在对日作战中，我失去了一只左眼，并且直到现在还有一颗子弹留在我的左腿骨上取不出来。这些仇恨我们是永远不会忘记的！
    当我们庆祝抗日战争胜利六周年的时候，美帝国主义竟敢不顾中国、亚洲以及全世界人民的反对，在旧金山召开签订所谓对日和约的会议，企图强制签订单独对日和约，企图以公开和“合法”的形式，加速重新武装日本，使日本成为美帝国主义在亚洲实行侵略的工具。今天我回想起八年抗战中，多少同志英勇牺牲的悲壮情景，越发增加了我对美帝国主义的仇恨。我记得在一九四二年的冬天，日寇以数万之众对山东的胶东地区，实行了所谓火把封锁、铁臂合围的大“扫荡”。造成马石山惨案，殉难军民近一千人，但中国人民是永远不会屈服的。当时我团往返冲杀，连续带领一千八百多名群众，从敌人的合击圈内突了出来。我团前参谋长、共产党党员陈子英同志，不幸负伤被俘，他在敌人面前那种英勇不屈的英雄行为，是我永远不会忘记的。当敌人问他：“你是八路军的军官吗？”他声色俱厉地说：“我不光是八路军的一个指挥员，还是中国共产党的党员，你们能把我怎么的！”说完就地拾起一条木棍，朝着问话的敌人劈头打了下去。他慷慨就义的故事，给了我们的部队以新的力量。在军民奋战之下，经过一个多月的时间终于粉碎了敌人这次罪恶的“扫荡”。尤其使我不能忘记的，是一九四四年秋天水道战斗中的英勇悲壮的故事。水道是敌人从牟平城向南伸入我胶东根据地，封锁当时我东、西海区联系的重要据点。堡高沟深，设防坚固，这里的敌人时常下乡烧杀奸淫，无恶不作。当部队听到受害人民上书首长求救的消息时，杀敌立功的激昂情绪达到了顶点。那时我当连长。战斗开始后，我带领的战士和所有参加攻击的部队，和猛虎一样地冲了上去。任你堡高沟深，任你火力猛烈，也挫折不了我们的胜利信心。在敌人的火网之中，过壕的桥刚刚架好，便被敌人的炮火打断了。这时架桥的同志一看急了眼，跳进水深及腰的壕沟里，用肩扛着断桥让部队通过。接着突击队便打开一个缺口，从碉堡中层突击进去。因为碉堡下层的敌人未肃清，顽抗的敌人便上下以火力疯狂地夹击他们。突击队的英雄们只剩下六个人了，可是他们仍然镇静得很，充满了胜利的信心。一声巨响，他们从堡内拉响了炸药，和敌人同归于尽。战斗胜利结束，将一小队日军全部消灭，并活捉了六个敌人。水道战斗突击队的英雄们，是中国人民优秀的儿女，他们为了人民的最大利益勇于牺牲的精神，将永垂不朽！将永远给我们以最大的力量！同志们，同胞们，我们今天看到美帝国主义单独对日媾和，重新武装日本的无耻行为，能不气愤吗？我们经过八年艰苦抗战好容易取得了胜利，难道能让美帝国主义重新武装日本再来残害我们吗？美帝国主义的这种阴谋，是我们中国人民坚决不能允许的。
    决心与中国人民为敌的美帝国主义，在抗日战争胜利之后，直接指使与援助国民党反动派向中国人民大举进攻，妄图通过它的走狗蒋介石来夺取中国人民的胜利果实，并代替日本法西斯过去在亚洲的地位；但它的这个美梦破灭了。中国人民在毛主席和共产党领导之下英勇战斗，在四年解放战争中消灭了由美帝国主义亲手装备的蒋匪帮军队八百多万人。胜利地建立了新中国，这证明中国人民的力量是无敌的。拿我所带领的塔山英雄团来说吧，在一九四八年秋天解放锦州战役中，我们响应了党的号召，为了切断敌人退路，保证全歼锦州和其他几个孤立据点的守敌，部队转到敌后，斩断了当时蒋匪关内外联系的大动脉——北宁路，迅速抢占了塔山（锦西、高桥镇之间，离海五、六里的一个小车站），血战六昼夜，击退了蒋匪海陆空军的联合进攻，铜墙铁壁似地堵住了由美帝国主义替蒋匪用兵船运来增援锦州的五个师、七个师，以至最后运到的十二个师的兵力，保证部队全歼锦州十二万守敌，活捉了敌人兵团司令范汉杰；由此迅速全歼东北守敌，进关南下，配合全国兄弟部队解放全中国。
    在四年解放战争中，我们消灭了蒋匪帮，解放了中国大陆，粉碎了美帝国主义代替日本法西斯变中国为其殖民地的梦想；但美帝国主义仍然不甘心于自己的失败，在去年六月间发动了侵朝战争，梦想先灭亡朝鲜，然后进攻中国人民和亚洲人民。可是中、朝人民在朝鲜战场所屡次取得的伟大胜利，粉碎了它的美梦。我们除了对美帝国主义单独对日媾和的卑鄙行为表示无限愤慨外，我们坚决要以实际行动，拥护周恩来外交部长八月十五日的声明。我们中国人民一贯主张和平，并为它作了重大贡献；但我们也决不惧怕战争，我们知道用什么方法来争取和保卫和平。如果美帝国主义胆敢挑动更大规模的侵略战争，它必将碰得头破血流，加速走进它自己的坟墓！
