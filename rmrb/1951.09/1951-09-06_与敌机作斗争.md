    Fighting Against Enemy Aircraft
    Li Yizhen
    Recently, I visited a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that achieved brilliant results in fighting against enemy aircraft. In less than two months, this unit shot down and damaged 83 enemy aircraft. The Volunteer Army leadership awarded the unit a collective merit citation.
    In order to launch a mass anti-aircraft firing campaign, before the start of the spring counter-offensive, the unit's headquarters ordered its subordinate units to "Organize all firearms to fire at enemy aircraft!" The unit's political department also called on the entire army to actively shoot down aircraft and strive to earn merit. After this, various units formulated plans for shooting down aircraft, and competitions were launched between platoons and squads.
    On April 23rd, the second day of the spring counter-offensive, the unit shot down its first aircraft. On that day, a certain anti-aircraft machine gun company of the unit had just arrived at its station and had not yet built fortifications when six enemy aircraft came into the air, circling over several nearby hilltops looking for targets. At this time, only one anti-aircraft machine gun of the second squad of the first platoon was set up. Gunner Gao Yuncheng held the machine gun tightly, watching the course of the aerial bandits with his eyes fixed. A few days ago, he was just practicing aiming, but now he was really going to fight the enemy aircraft. He nervously turned the muzzle of the gun, following the enemy aircraft's flight. The enemy aircraft got closer and closer, and the fuselage became larger and larger. He pulled the trigger at once, but the bullets went wide, and the aircraft just swept over his head. While Gao Yuncheng was feeling annoyed, the enemy aircraft circled around and flew over again. This time, Gao Yuncheng calmed down, opened his eyes wide, and waited calmly for the opportunity to shoot, calculating the speed and distance of the enemy aircraft's flight in his mind. When he fired his bullets the second time, he hit the aircraft's belly squarely. The enemy aircraft immediately emitted a puff of black smoke, flipped over twice, emitted white smoke, and then burst into flames and fell to the south of the mountain. All the comrades in the company shouted. Zheng Jinming, the deputy platoon leader of the first platoon, and several soldiers excitedly ran in the direction where the aircraft had fallen. The enemy aircraft fell beside a river ditch and was shattered. Deputy Platoon Leader Zheng and others searched nearby. Suddenly, an American devil crawled out of a broken air-raid shelter and knelt down in front of everyone, holding his gun with both hands, sweat streaming down his face. This was the enemy aircraft observer, Golding Jack. The enemy aircraft pilot, Schuder Melvin, was also captured alive by a friendly unit on the same day.
    The company and gunner Gao Yuncheng immediately received commendations from their superiors, and the news quickly spread throughout the entire unit, further increasing the confidence of officers and soldiers in all units to shoot down aircraft. Anti-aircraft machine guns, light and heavy machine guns, and even rifles from various units fired at enemy aircraft, and good news of shooting down enemy aircraft kept coming. A certain anti-aircraft artillery company's first and second platoons each shot down two enemy aircraft with eleven shells; a certain anti-aircraft machine gun company shot down four enemy aircraft in two days; a certain company, Qu Xiuxi's squad, shot down four enemy aircraft; Zheng Jinming, deputy platoon leader of a certain company's first platoon, shot down an enemy aircraft with three anti-aircraft machine gun bullets; when a certain regiment captured the command post of the US 38th Regiment's first battalion, they shot down a helicopter attempting to rescue enemy officers with collective firing; Yang Zhengui, a heavy machine gunner of a certain company, shot down a twin-engine bomber with ten bullets...
    From these victories, the unit quickly gained experience in anti-aircraft firing and increased its confidence even more. In the heroic battle against enemy aircraft, a certain anti-aircraft machine gun company shot down seven enemy aircraft and damaged five. During the Battle of Daedong-ri on April 30th, enemy aircraft strafed and bombed the company's position all day long. A bomb destroyed the base of a machine gun in the second squad, and the tool bag next to the machine gun was riddled with shrapnel. Machine gun bullets swept down like a string of pearls, and several holes were shot through the trouser legs of Ji Xirong, the first platoon leader. However, none of the gunners in each squad left their posts. They wiped the dust off their faces, rubbed their eyes, and still raised their heads high, never relaxing their fire on the diving enemy aircraft. At 9:00 a.m., Ji Xirong shot off a large piece of metal from the wing of an enemy aircraft; twenty minutes later, Deputy Platoon Leader Zheng Jinming also hit the right wing of another aircraft. In the afternoon, gunner Yu Mingwu shot down an enemy aircraft. After this, the enemy aircraft dared not fly to their position again.
    Afterwards, the unit frequently deployed anti-aircraft weapons in a planned manner to form a tight air fire network, thus achieving even greater results. In the second stage of the spring counter-offensive, a certain unit of the Volunteer Army had already inserted into the enemy's heart and launched fierce battles. In order to ensure that follow-up troops could move during the day, the unit erected countless anti-aircraft weapons in an area more than thirty li long. As soon as enemy aircraft flew into this area, they encountered fire from all directions and were beaten into a chaotic spin. After several aircraft were shot down, whenever enemy aircraft flew into this area, they either flew high to pass over or detoured away in a panic. From May 17th to 21st, in five days, this area shot down ten enemy aircraft and damaged ten. This ensured the timely movement of follow-up troops.
    On another occasion, a certain anti-aircraft artillery company heroically defended a bridge over the Imjin River between Saoning and Liancheon. On that day, enemy aircraft attempted to destroy the bridge to prevent our troops from advancing, flying in three times a day. The last time, six aircraft came and frantically dropped bombs on the bridge. The bombs fell into the river, stirring up huge water columns. Many bombs also fell on the anti-aircraft artillery position. The rocks thrown up by the explosions bruised the cheeks and eye sockets of gunner Du Lianyou, but he still bravely persisted in passing shells. A heavy bomb exploded twenty meters away from the gun, and rubble and soil splashed onto the anti-aircraft gun and the gunners. Another gasoline bomb exploded in front of the position, and the burning gasoline smoke made people nauseous, tearful, and difficult to observe, but the gunners ignored everything and calmly aimed. Second gunner Meng Shaoxue fired ten shots in succession, and one enemy aircraft emitted smoke and fell down with a somersault. In this battle, the bridge over the Imjin River remained standing.
    In this way, during the spring counter-offensive and the ten-day blocking battle, this unit shot down and damaged a total of eighty-three enemy aircraft—of which fifty-six were shot down. (Xinhua News Agency)

    与敌机作斗争
    李翼振
    最近我访问了在与敌机作战中获得辉煌战绩的志愿军某部。这个部队在不到两个月的时间中，打落打伤敌机八十三架。志愿军领导机关为该部记了集体功。
    为了展开群众性的对空射击运动，在春季反击战开始前，该部司令部就命令所属部队“组织一切火器向敌机开火！”该部政治部也号召全军积极打飞机，争取立功。此后，各部队就纷纷订立了打飞机的计划，排班间也展开了打飞机的竞赛。
    四月二十三日，春季反击战开始的第二天，该部打下了第一架飞机。那一天，该部某高射机枪连刚赶到驻地，还未构筑工事，空中就来了六架敌机，在附近几个山头上盘旋着找寻目标。这时只有一排二班的一挺高射机枪架起来了，射手高云成同志握紧机枪，目不转睛地注视着空中强盗的航向。前几天他还只是试试瞄准，如今真正要和敌机搏战了。他很紧张地跟随着敌机的飞行转动着枪口。敌机越来越近，机身越来越大，他一下扣动了扳机，子弹打偏了，飞机刚好从头顶掠过去。高云成正在懊恼的时候，敌机绕了一圈又飞过来了，高云成这一次沉住了气，睁大了眼睛，镇静地等待着射击时机，心里计算着敌机飞行的速度和距离。当他第二次射出子弹的时候，刚好打中飞机的腹部。敌机顿时冒出一股黑烟，翻了两个筋斗，又冒着白烟，接着就冒火燃烧起来，落向山的南边去了，全连的同志都叫起来了。一排副排长郑金明和几个战士兴奋地朝着飞机落下的方向跑去。敌机落在河沟旁边，已经跌碎。郑副排长等就在附近搜索。忽然一个美国鬼子从一个破防空洞里钻了出来，在大家面前跪下，双手举着枪，吓得汗珠直往下淌，这是敌机观察员戈丁杰克。敌机驾驶员舒德·梅尔芬也在当天被友邻部队活捉了。
    该连和射手高云成，马上得到上级的记功表扬，这个消息也就迅速传遍了整个部队，更加提高了各部指战员打飞机的信心。各部的高射机枪、轻重机枪甚至步枪都对敌机开了火，击落敌机的捷报不断传出来。某高射炮连一、二排各用十一发炮弹击落敌机二架；某高射机枪连两天就击落敌机四架；某连屈秀喜一个班击落敌机四架；某连一排副排长郑金明以三发高射机枪子弹打落敌机一架；某团在攻占美军第三十八团一营的指挥所时，以集体的射击，打下一架企图营救敌人军官的直升飞机；某连重机枪射手杨振贵，以十发子弹击落双引擎轰炸机一架……。
    从这些胜利中，该部迅速取得了对空射击的经验，也更加提高了信心。某高射机枪连在与敌机英勇作战中，一连击落敌机七架，击伤敌机五架。在四月三十日道德里战斗中，敌机整日不停地在该连阵地上扫射投弹。炸弹把二班一挺机枪的座脚炸坏了，机枪旁边放着的工具袋被弹片打得稀烂。机枪子弹像连珠似地狂扫下来，一排长纪希荣的裤管被射穿了好几个洞。但是各班的射手没有一个离开岗位，他们擦擦脸上的尘土，揉揉眼睛，仍旧高昂着头，一刻不放松对俯冲下来的敌机射击。上午九时，纪希荣把敌机机翼打掉下一大块金属片；隔了二十分钟，副排长郑金明也打中了另一架飞机的右翅膀。下午射手余明武打下来了一架敌机。这以后敌机就不敢再飞到他们的阵地上来了。
    以后，该部经常把高射武器有计划地布置起来，组成严密的空中火网，因而获得更大的战果。在春季反击战第二阶段的作战中，志愿军某部已经插入敌人心脏展开激烈的战斗。为了保障后续部队能够白天运动，该部在三十多华里长的地区，架起了无数的高射火器，敌机一飞到这里，就遇到从四面八方射来的炮火，被打得团团乱转。在打下几架以后，敌机一飞到这个地区，不是升高而过，便是狼狈地绕道而去。从五月十七日到二十一日五天中，这个地区就击落敌机十架，击伤十架。这样就保证了后续部队及时的运动。
    另一次，某高射炮连英勇地保卫了朔宁与涟川之间的一座临津江大桥。当日，敌机妄图炸毁这座桥梁，阻止我部队前进，一天飞来三次，最后一次来了六架，疯狂地向桥上投弹。炸弹落在江中，激起巨大的水柱。高射炮阵地上也落下不少炸弹，炸起的石块把炮手杜连有的脸颊眼窝打青肿了，但他仍勇敢地坚持传送炮弹。一个重磅炸弹在离炮二十公尺处爆炸了，碎石土块扑上高射炮和炮手们的身上。又一个汽油弹在阵地前炸开了，燃烧着的汽油烟使人发呕、流泪，难以观察，但炮手们不管一切，仍沉着瞄准。二炮手孟少学连发十炮，一架敌机冒了烟，一个筋斗翻落下来。在这次战斗中，临津江上的大桥屹然未动。
    就这样，在春季反击战及十天阻击战中，这个部队一共击落、击伤了敌机八十三架——其中击落五十六架。（新华社）
