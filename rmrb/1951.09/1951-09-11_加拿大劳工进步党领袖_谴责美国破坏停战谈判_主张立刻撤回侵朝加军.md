Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th. According to a Toronto report in the New York "Daily Worker" on the 4th, Tim Buck, leader of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, said that the Truman administration's "deliberate provocations caused the breakdown of the Korean armistice negotiations," thus "seriously endangering world peace." Commenting on the Truman administration's reneging on its promise of a ceasefire at the 38th parallel, Buck said: "The Canadian government must be forced not to follow the United States' policies in Korea and the Far East. Canada must clearly express its support for a ceasefire at the 38th parallel in Korea. Canada must demand that our Canadian soldiers immediately return home from Korea."

    谴责美国破坏停战谈判
    主张立刻撤回侵朝加军
    【新华社布拉格十日电】据纽约“工人日报”四日多伦多讯，加拿大劳工进步党领袖布克说：杜鲁门政府“故意挑衅，使朝鲜停火谈判破裂”，因此“严重地危害了世界和平”。布克在评论杜鲁门政府背弃在三八线上休战的诺言时说：“必须迫使加拿大政府不追随美国在朝鲜及远东的政策。加拿大必须明白表示赞成在朝鲜的三八线上停火。加拿大必须要求我们加拿大的士兵立刻从朝鲜回国。”
