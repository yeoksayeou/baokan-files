Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published an article titled "Critique of Speculative Publishers' Speculative Publications" in the "Cultural Life" section on page three on August 16th, Xin Chao Bookstore submitted a self-criticism on August 17th, and a second self-criticism on August 19th. Excerpts from these two self-criticisms are published below.

    We fully accept the criticism of our bookstore in the People's Daily "Cultural Life" section on August 16th. Our self-criticism is written below:

    First, due to the errors of the leaders, our overall publishing direction in the past was basically speculative and opportunistic, solely for the purpose of making profits. We took advantage of the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to learn about politics and policies after liberation, and compiled a variety of speculative books to exploit this gap. Our motives were impure and extremely wrong.

    Second, we often handled manuscripts very carelessly. There was no editorial department in the store. The selection of some manuscripts was based solely on the political stance or social status of the introducer or author/translator; some were only slightly proofread before being sent to print. Sometimes, even after errors appeared in the books, we ourselves were unaware of them after publication. This shows our lack of seriousness towards publishing work and our irresponsibility towards the people. This approach is completely unacceptable.

    The following measures will be taken:

    One, "Elementary Course in Social Science" contains serious errors of principle and will be recalled in full immediately. "History of French Imperialist Aggression Against China" is disorganized and chaotic, and its distribution will be stopped immediately.

    Two, from today onwards, we will re-examine all published books and handle them separately, aiming to complete this task in the short term.

    Three, regarding the overall direction of our store, we will take the following measures: thoroughly reorganize the leadership of our store; and organize an editorial committee to effectively improve our work.

### 新潮书店关于出版工作的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    新潮书店关于出版工作的检讨
    编者按：本报八月十六日第三版“文化生活”栏发表“评投机出版商的投机出版物”一文以后，新潮书店在八月十七日曾送来一篇检讨，八月十九日又交来第二次检讨。现将这两篇检讨的内容节录发表如下。我们完全接受八月十六日人民日报“文化生活”栏对我店的批评，现将我们的检讨写在下面：
    第一、由于领导人的错误，我们过去出版的总方向基本上是投机取巧，单纯以营利为目的。我们利用广大人民在解放后要求学习政治、政策的热潮，就剪编了多种的投机书来钻这个空子。我们的动机是不纯正的、极端错误的。
    第二、我们对于来稿的处理经常是很轻率的。店内并无编审部的组织。一部分文稿只凭介绍人或著译者的政治立场或社会地位来作取舍的标准；一部分亦仅略加校阅即行付排。有时书中出了错误，甚至在出版后连我们自己也还不知道。这表示我们对于出版工作的不严肃，对于人民的不负责任。这种作风完全是要不得的。
    今后的处理办法：
    一、“社会科学初级教程”内容有严重的原则性错误，即日全部收回。“法帝侵华史”内容芜杂零乱，即日起停止发行。
    二、即日起，我们将已出各书全部重新检查，分别处理，拟在短期内完成。
    三、对于我店总的方向，我们将作以下的处理：澈底改组我店领导机构；并组织编审委员会，切实改进工作。
