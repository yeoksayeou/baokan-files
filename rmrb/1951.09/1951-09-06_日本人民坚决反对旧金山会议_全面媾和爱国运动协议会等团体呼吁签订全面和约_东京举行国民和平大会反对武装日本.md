Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: TASS, September 4th: Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council has submitted an appeal to the delegations participating in the San Francisco Conference, emphasizing that more than five million Japanese people have stood up in support of signing a comprehensive peace treaty, and that "the majority of Japanese people resolutely oppose the San Francisco Conference."

The appeal points out that Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and his entourage cannot represent the will of the Japanese people, and even if Yoshida signs the peace treaty, the Japanese people will never recognize it. The appeal states: "Almost all Asian countries, including China, India, and Burma, oppose the San Francisco Conference. We, together with them and the people of all peace-loving countries in the world, demand that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China immediately convene a comprehensive peace conference."

Yoshida Shiji, Chairman of the All-Japan Industry-Specific Trade Union Conference, on behalf of the Japanese working class, sent a letter to Soviet delegation leader Gromyko, hoping that the San Francisco Conference would "discuss the various draft peace treaties submitted by the countries that participated in the war against Japan, and that all these countries should sign a peace treaty based on international agreements – including the Potsdam Proclamation." Yoshida Shiji pointed out that without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China, "the conference will not be successful." He believes that the United States' refusal to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China to the conference is "unfair and illegal."

The letter also stated: "The Anglo-American draft treaty, which aims to rearm Japan and maintain American military bases in Japan, will endanger world peace and deprive the Japanese people of their national independence. Therefore, the Japanese people resolutely oppose the Anglo-American draft treaty."

The "Metal Worker" newspaper said that the National Steel Workers' Union of Japan had issued a statement firmly opposing the American-made peace treaty with Japan. The "All Delivery News" newspaper said that the National Union of Transport Workers of Japan had issued a similar statement, emphasizing that "the American-made draft peace treaty does not conform to the wishes of the Japanese people."

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Tokyo Dispatch: Amidst the surging emotions of the Japanese people opposing a separate peace, the "Japan National Peace Promotion Conference" held a "National Peace Conference" at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo on the 1st. Approximately sixty groups, including the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and its affiliated unions, and religious organizations, participated in the conference. The conference passed a declaration stating: "We oppose signing a treaty that would subordinate Japan to a certain country and deepen the current world crisis." The declaration also opposes the rearmament of Japan and demands that no military agreements be concluded with foreign countries.

After the meeting, the conference attendees, including disabled veterans from the last war, held a demonstration. The slogans raised by the demonstrators accused Yoshida, the head of the Japanese delegation to the San Francisco Conference, of being an American puppet, opposed a military alliance against the Soviet Union, and demanded the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with all countries that had fought against Japan, including the Soviet Union and People's China. The slogans also pointed out that the Anglo-American version of the peace treaty to be signed at the San Francisco Conference would plunge Japan into a new war.

    日本人民坚决反对旧金山会议
    全面媾和爱国运动协议会等团体呼吁签订全面和约
    东京举行国民和平大会反对武装日本
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社四日讯：东京消息：日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会已向参加旧金山会议的各代表团提出呼吁书，强调指出五百万以上的日本人民已挺身而出拥护签订全面和约，“大多数日本人民都坚决反对旧金山和会”。
    呼吁书指出：日本首相吉田茂和他的一行人员并不能代表日本人民的意志，纵然吉田在和约上签字，日本人民也永远不会承认。呼吁书说：“几乎所有的亚洲国家，包括中国、印度和缅甸，都反对旧金山和会。我们和它们以及全世界一切爱好和平国家的人民一道，要求美国、英国、苏联和中华人民共和国立即召开全面和会。”
    全日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治代表日本工人阶级致函苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯，希望旧金山会议“讨论参加对日作战各国所提出的各种不同的和约草案，所有这些国家应根据国际协定——包括波茨坦公告——来签订和约”。吉田资治指出：没有中华人民共和国的代表参加，“大会不会成功”。他认为美国拒绝邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加会议是“不公平和不合法的”。
    该信又说：“以重新武装日本与保持美国在日本的军事基地为目的的美英和约草案，将危及全世界的和平，并剥夺日本人民的民族独立。所以日本人民坚决反对英美和约草案。”
    “金属劳动者”报说：日本全国钢铁工人工会曾发表声明，坚决反对美制对日和约草案。“全递新闻”报说：日本交通工人全国工会曾发表同样声明，该声明强调指出：“美制对日和约草案不符合日本人民的愿望”。
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：在日本人民反对单独媾和的激昂情绪下，“日本推进和平国民会议”一日在东京靖国神社举行了“国民和平大会”。参加大会的有日本工会总评议会及其所属工会、宗教团体等约六十个团体。大会通过宣言说：“我们反对签订一个将使日本从属于某一个国家，并将加深目前世界危机的和约。”宣言并反对日本重新武装，要求不与外国缔结任何军事协定。
    会后，大会群众，包括上次大战的残废军人在内，举行示威游行。示威者所举的标语指责日本出席旧金山会议的代表团团长吉田是美国傀儡，反对一个对付苏联的军事联盟，并要求与一切曾与日本作战的国家，包括苏联和人民中国，签订一个全面的对日和约。标语并指出：准备在旧金山会议签订英美版的对日和约，将使日本卷入新战争的漩涡。
