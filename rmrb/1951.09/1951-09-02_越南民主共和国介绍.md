On September 2, 1945, under the leadership of the Dongyang Communist Party (i.e., the Indochinese Communist Party) and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people broke free from the shackles of imperialism that had bound them for decades and established their own people's state – the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In August 1945, when Japanese imperialism announced its unconditional surrender, the Vietnamese people had already established people's armed forces and political power in the guerrilla war against Japanese imperialism and its French collaborators, creating vast liberated areas in six provinces of North Vietnam. This laid the foundation for the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At that time, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Independence League, led by the Communist Party, decided to convene the All-Vietnam People's Congress in preparation for welcoming the new stage of finally defeating Japanese imperialism, and to prepare for the liberation of all of Vietnam. When this congress was convened on August 15 in Tan Trao, Tuyen Quang Province, North Vietnam, it received the news of the unconditional surrender of Japanese imperialism. The meeting immediately decided to issue an order for a nationwide general uprising and established the National General Uprising Committee (i.e., the "National Liberation Committee"). The people across the country responded enthusiastically to the general uprising order. On August 19, the Vietnamese people liberated Hanoi, the capital of North Vietnam. Bao Dai, the "Annam Emperor" supported by Japanese imperialism, was forced to abdicate on August 24. Subsequently, Saigon and the provinces of South Vietnam were also liberated. This is the famous "August Revolution." On September 2, Chairman Ho Chi Minh broadcast the Declaration of Independence in Hanoi, proclaiming the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The newly born Democratic Republic of Vietnam was re-invaded by imperialism just three weeks after its founding. On September 23, French colonial troops, assisted by British troops, returned to Vietnam. Before reinforcements from mainland France arrived in large numbers, French imperialism adopted a policy of negotiating on the one hand and encroaching on the other, and signed an agreement with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in March 1946, recognizing Vietnam as an independent country with its own government, army, and finances. However, in December of the same year, French imperialism broke its promise and launched a full-scale offensive against Vietnam. Under the call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people took up arms and bravely resisted, and have persisted to this day.

In the six years of war, the strength of the Vietnamese people has grown day by day. The Vietnamese people and the Vietnam People's Army have halted the large-scale offensives of the French army. From the beginning of the war to the present, the Vietnam People's Army has annihilated 175,000 French troops. The French army was forced to defend several isolated cities such as Hanoi, Saigon, and Haiphong. From last September to now, the Vietnam People's Army has won four consecutive major victories in Cao Bang-Lang Son, the midlands, the coastal mining area, and Ninh Binh Province in North Vietnam, annihilating more than 20,000 French troops and completely liberating many strategic locations on the border of North Vietnam. This has brought about a major change in the situation on the North Vietnamese battlefield. The main base area for the Vietnamese people's resistance in northern North Vietnam has been further consolidated. The main position of the French army—the Red River Delta—has become even more isolated.

Since its establishment, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has not only achieved brilliant victories militarily, but also made great achievements politically. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has passed a democratic constitution and carried out important democratic reforms. Land reform has been carried out nationwide. 22,931 hectares of land formerly belonging to French colonists and Vietnamese traitors have been distributed to landless farmers. Land rent has been generally reduced by 25 percent. The number of workers and peasants participating in government work is increasing day by day. The most significant achievement in culture and education is the elimination of 13.55 million illiterate people.

This February, the Vietnam Workers' Party, guided by Marxism-Leninism, was declared established. It has won the support of the broad masses of the people. The program of the Labor Party correctly stipulates the tasks, guidelines, and policies of the Vietnamese people's revolution, which is a powerful guarantee for the final victory of the Vietnamese people. This March, Vietnam's two united front organizations—the Vietnam Independence League and the Vietnam National United Association—merged to form the Vietnam National United Front. This has further strengthened the great unity of the Vietnamese people. At present, the Vietnamese people across the country are actively preparing for a general counter-offensive. Patriotic emulation campaigns have been launched throughout the country to strive for the large-scale annihilation of the enemy and increased production.

The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has given the Vietnamese people tremendous encouragement. Last year, China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and other Eastern European People's Democratic countries successively announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, demonstrating the great sympathy and support of the people of all countries for the Vietnamese people's revolution.

On the other hand, after its defeat in China, U.S. imperialism has increasingly intensified its interference in Vietnam, attempting to turn Vietnam into a military base for aggression against New China and suppression of the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia. In just five months, from August 1950 to January 1951, the United States gave the French colonialists 150 aircraft and other munitions. U.S. military missions are actively operating in Saigon. During the Korean armistice talks, the notorious warmonger, New York Governor Thomas Dewey, visited Saigon to study the so-called "possibility of providing rapid military and economic assistance to Indochina."

Recently, U.S. imperialism has brazenly announced its invitation to the puppet emperor Bao Dai and the puppet regimes of Laos and Cambodia to send representatives to the San Francisco peace treaty conference, attempting to obliterate the Vietnamese people's anti-Japanese achievements and their sacred right to participate in the peace treaty with Japan. As everyone knows, the infamous Bao Dai is an "emperor picked up from the garbage heap" by the French. When the Japanese invaders occupied Vietnam, Bao Dai acted as a puppet of Japanese imperialism. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, France took over this puppet from the Japanese. During World War II, it was the entire Vietnamese people under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh who took up arms and fought bravely against the Japanese invaders. It is obvious that Bao Dai has absolutely no right to represent the Vietnamese people. Hoang Minh Giam, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a statement on July 20 this year, pointing out that only the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the sole legitimate representative of the Vietnamese people when signing the peace treaty with Japan.

Although U.S. imperialism uses all kinds of methods to interfere in Vietnam and support the French colonialists and their lackeys, it can never save them from their approaching doom. The 21 million Vietnamese people, firmly united around the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, have ample determination and confidence to completely defeat the American interventionists and the French colonialists.

    越南民主共和国介绍
    一九四五年九月二日，越南人民在东洋共产党（按即印度支那共产党）和胡志明主席领导下，冲破了数十年来帝国主义的镣铐，建立了人民自己的国家——越南民主共和国。 一九四五年八月，日本帝国主义宣布无条件投降时，越南人民已在反对日本帝国主义及其法国合作者的游击战争中建立了人民武装和政权，他们在北越的六个省建立了广大的解放区。这就为越南民主共和国的成立奠定了基础。当时，共产党领导的越南独立同盟中央委员会为迎接最后击败日本帝国主义的新阶段的到来，曾决定召开全越人民代表大会，准备解放全越南。这大会于八月十五日在北越宣光省的新潮召开时，就得到了日本帝国主义无条件投降的消息。会议立即决定颁发全国总起义的命令，并成立了全国总起义委员会（按即“民族解放委员会”）。全国人民热烈地响应了总起义命令。八月十九日，越南人民解放了北越首府河内。日本帝国主义扶植的“安南皇帝”保大于八月二十四日被迫宣告退位。接着，西贡和南越各省也相继解放。这就是有名的“八月革命”。九月二日，胡志明主席在河内广播独立宣言，宣告越南民主共和国的成立。
    新生的越南民主共和国在其成立三星期后，就遭到帝国主义的再度侵犯。九月二十三日，法国殖民军在英国军队的协助下卷土重来越南。当从法国本土调来的援军还未大量到达的时候，法帝国主义曾采取一面谈判、一面蚕食的政策，并于一九四六年三月和越南民主共和国政府签订协定，承认越南有自己的政府、军队和财政的独立国家。但到了同年十二月，法帝国主义就背信弃义，向越南进行全面进攻。越南人民在胡志明主席的号召下，拿起武器奋起抗战，一直坚持至今。
    在六年的战争中，越南人民的力量一天天强大。越南人民和越南人民军，已经制止了法军的大规模进攻。从战争开始到现在，越南人民军共歼灭了法军十七万五千人。法军被迫困守河内、西贡、海防等几个孤立的城市里。去年九月到现在，越南人民军在北越高平—谅山、中游、沿海矿区和宁平省接连打了四次大胜仗，歼灭法军二万多人，完全解放了北越边境的许多战略要地。这使北越战场的形势起了重大的变化。北越北部越南人民抗战的主要根据地更加巩固了。法军的主要阵地——红河三角洲则更加孤立了。
    越南民主共和国自成立以来，不仅在军事上获得光辉的胜利，在政治上也获得了伟大的成就。越南民主共和国已通过了民主的宪法，进行了重要的民主改革。土地改革已在全国范围进行。二万二千九百三十一公顷以前属于法国殖民者和越奸的土地已经分配给无地的农民。地租普遍降低了百分之二十五。工人和农民参加政权工作的人数日益增加。在文化教育方面最显著的成就是消灭了一千三百五十五万的文盲。
    今年二月，以马列主义为指导原则的越南劳动党宣告成立。它获得了广大人民的拥护。劳动党的纲领正确地规定了越南人民革命的任务、方针、和政策，这是越南人民取得最后胜利的有力保证。今年三月，越南的两个统一战线组织——越南独立同盟和越南国民联合会进行合并，成立越南国民联合战线。这更加加强了越南全国人民大团结。目前越南全国人民正在积极准备总反攻。全国各地展开了爱国主义的竞赛运动，为大量歼灭敌人和增加生产而努力。
    中国人民革命的胜利，给越南人民以莫大的鼓励。去年，中国、苏联、朝鲜及东欧各人民民主国家相继宣布和越南建立外交关系，表现了各国人民对越南人民革命的莫大同情和支持。
    另一方面，美帝国主义在中国失败后，日益加紧了对越南的干涉，力图把越南变为侵略新中国和镇压东南亚民族解放运动的军事基地。仅在一九五○年八月至一九五一年一月五个月中，美国就给了法国殖民者一百五十架飞机和其他军火。美国的军事代表团正积极在西贡活动。朝鲜停战谈判期间，恶名昭著的战争贩子、美国纽约州州长杜威曾到西贡，研究所谓“迅速给印度支那军事和经济援助的可能性”。
    最近，美帝国主义又悍然宣布邀请傀儡皇帝保大和老挝、柬埔寨的傀儡政权派遣代表参加旧金山对日和约会议，妄图抹煞越南人民的抗日功绩和参加对日媾和的神圣权利。大家知道：臭名远扬的保大是法国从“垃圾堆里捡起来的皇帝”。在日寇占领越南时，保大充当了日本帝国主义的傀儡。日寇投降后，法国又从日寇手中接收了这个木偶。在第二次大战期间，拿起武器和日寇英勇作战的是胡志明主席领导下的越南全体人民。保大绝对无权代表越南人民，是显而易见的。越南民主共和国政府外交部部长黄明鉴已在今年七月二十日发表声明，指出在签订对日和约时，只有越南民主共和国政府，才是越南人民唯一合法的代表。
    尽管美帝国主义用尽种种方法干涉越南，支持法国殖民者及其走狗，但是它绝不能挽救他们日趋灭亡的命运。坚固地团结在越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席周围的二千一百万越南人民，有着充沛的决心和信心彻底击败美国干涉者和法国殖民者。
