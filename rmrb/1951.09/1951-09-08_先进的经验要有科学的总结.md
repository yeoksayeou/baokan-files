    Advanced Experiences Require Scientific Summarization
    During the Red May production competition last year, Hao Jianxiu, a female worker at the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, achieved remarkable results in reducing roller cotton waste. At the time, some people thought it was nothing more than a good work attitude and being more diligent than others, not worthy of special attention. It wasn't until February of this year that the factory began to summarize Hao Jianxiu's experience. After two summaries, they believed that Hao Jianxiu's work method was "three diligences and three fasts—diligent eyes, seeing quickly; diligent legs, running quickly; diligent hands, connecting quickly." The summary was wrong, and the promotion work also failed. Later, a special committee was organized by the labor union and the administration to re-summarize, and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union also sent people to participate. After careful and meticulous measurement and research, combining the theoretical knowledge of engineers, the technical experience of workers, and Soviet experience, a correct and scientific summary of Hao Jianxiu's work method was made. This summary process fully illustrates: (1) Without a true understanding in thought of the great creativity of the liberated working masses, a correct summary of advanced experience cannot be made; (2) Simply looking at the superficial phenomena in a formalistic way, coupled with subjective assumptions, also cannot produce a correct summary of advanced experience; (3) With advanced experience, but without scientific summarization, without elevating the experience to a systematic theory, then this advanced experience cannot be improved or promoted.
    In various production departments, new records are constantly emerging. Many workers and technicians who create new records have received attention and rewards; however, many of the advanced experiences they have created have not been seriously and scientifically summarized. Hidden within this are the most valuable and inexhaustible treasures of our great motherland. Many comrades leading production and labor union comrades think that everyone who creates new records in production is "nothing more than a good work attitude and being more diligent than others." This kind of thinking is very harmful. Failure to change this thinking will stifle and bury the productive forces that could be further developed!

### 先进的经验要有科学的总结

    先进的经验要有科学的总结
    去年红五月生产竞赛中，国营青岛第六棉纺织厂女工郝建秀就创造了少出皮辊花的显著成绩。当时，有些人认为无非是劳动态度好、比别人勤快而已，不值得特别重视。到今年二月，该厂才开始总结郝建秀的经验。总结了两次，都认为郝建秀的工作法就是“三勤三快——眼勤，看得快；腿勤，跑得快；手勤，接头快”。总结作错了，推广工作也就失败了。以后又由工会、行政方面组织专门委员会重新总结，纺织工会全国委员会也派人参加，经过仔细认真地测定、研究，把工程师理论知识和工人技术经验以及苏联经验结合起来，才把郝建秀工作法作出了正确的科学的总结。这个总结的过程充分说明了：（一）在没有从思想上真正认识解放了的工人群众的伟大创造力的时候，就作不出先进经验的正确总结；（二）只是形式主义地从表面现象看一下，加上主观主义的推断，也作不出先进经验的正确的总结；（三）有了先进的经验，没有科学的总结，没有把经验提升为系统的理论，那么，这先进经验就无法提高，无法推广。
    在各个生产部门，不断地出现新的纪录。有许多创造新纪录的工人和技术人员，受到了重视和奖励；可是，他们创造的不少先进经验，却还没有被认真地加以科学的总结。这里面蕴藏着我们伟大祖国的最可贵的发掘不尽的宝藏。许多领导生产的同志和工会工作同志，把生产上的一切创造新纪录的人都认为“无非是劳动态度好、比别人勤快而已”，这种想法是非常有害的。不改变这种想法，就会把可能更加发展的生产力窒息了，埋没了！
