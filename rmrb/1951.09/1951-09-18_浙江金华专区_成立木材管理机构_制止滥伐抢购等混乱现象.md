    Zhejiang Jinhua Prefecture

    Establishes Timber Management Organization
    To Stop Indiscriminate Logging, Panic Buying, and Other Chaotic Phenomena
    In order to implement the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on conserving timber, the Jinhua Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Zhejiang Province established the "Jinhua Prefecture Timber Harvesting and Purchasing Management Committee" on August 22, responsible for the unified management of timber harvesting and purchasing work in the entire prefecture.
    Mountainous areas in Jinhua Prefecture account for 75 percent of the total land area of the prefecture, but mature forests in areas with relatively convenient transportation have been almost completely cut down. Due to the lack of unified management methods for harvesting and purchasing work in various counties and districts, chaotic phenomena such as indiscriminate logging and panic buying have occurred. In order to stop this phenomenon, the Prefectural Administrative Office issued instructions on August 17, stipulating that all counties should strictly implement the forest harvesting management regulations promulgated by the East China Region; on the 21st and 22nd, it issued instructions on conserving timber in conjunction with the Prefectural Finance and Economics Committee. The instructions required all counties to immediately inspect the harvesting and use of trees. All purchases that had been approved by the Prefectural Commissioner's Office but had not yet been completed were to be suspended pending inspection. Existing timber that has already been felled is not allowed to be transported out without a transportation certificate from the local county-level government or above. The instructions also required people's governments at all levels, farmers' associations, troops, institutions, and schools to immediately organize study and discussion of the State Council's instructions on conserving timber and the People's Daily editorial on August 17, "Resolutely Stop Wasteful Behavior of National Timber Resources." A mass movement for conserving timber should be launched, so that every household is aware and everyone cherishes forests and conserves timber. Furthermore, vigorously mobilize the masses to carry out forestry construction such as forest protection, afforestation, and forest cultivation.

    浙江金华专区
    成立木材管理机构
    制止滥伐抢购等混乱现象
    浙江金华专署为贯彻中央人民政府政务院关于节约木材的指示，已于八月二十二日成立了“金华专区木材采伐收购管理委员会”，负责统一管理全专区木材采伐与收购工作。
    金华专区的山地面积占全专区土地面积的百分之七十五，但交通较为便利地方的成材森林已快被砍完了。由于各县、区在采伐与收购工作上缺乏统一管理的办法，致发生滥伐、抢购等混乱现象。为制止这种现象，专区行政公署曾于八月十七日发出指示，规定各县严格执行华东区颁布的森林采伐管理办法；又在二十一、二十二两日，与专区财政经济委员会分别发出关于节约木材的指示。指示中要各县立即检查林木采伐及使用情况，凡经过专署批准而还没有完成采购的一律暂停，听候检查。已经砍伐下来的现存木材，没有当地县级以上政府的搬运证明书就不准运出；指示中并要各级人民政府、农民协会、部队、机关、学校等对政务院关于节约木材的指示及人民日报八月十七日“坚决制止浪费国家木材资源的行为”的社论，立即组织学习讨论。展开群众性的节约木材运动，务使家喻户晓，人人爱护森林、节约木材，并进一步地大力发动群众进行护林、造林、育林等林业建设。
