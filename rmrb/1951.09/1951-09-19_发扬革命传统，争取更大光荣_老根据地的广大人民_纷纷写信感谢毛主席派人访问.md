Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory
The Broad Masses of People in Old Revolutionary Base Areas
Write Letters Thanking Chairman Mao for Sending People to Visit

We Have Made Great Progress Since Liberation
We Still Strive to Avoid Complacency and Seek Further Progress
Dear Chairman Mao:

The visiting delegation you sent has arrived in our Changgang Township. We thank you for your concern for us. Now, let me report to you the situation in our township since liberation.

Changgang Township has been liberated for over two years. Under your leadership and the leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, we have successively carried out the struggle against local bullies, land reform, the great production movement, the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and have achieved great results.

In the struggle against local bullies and land reform, through our accusations and the judgments of the people's government, the biggest feudal evil bully heads in the area, Liu Yuanzun, Zhong Chuanyao, and Zhong Shigen and his sons, were executed. Seventeen feudal landlord households were also overthrown. We won back our land from the landlord class, and we were allocated over 700 piculs of rice, 19 head of cattle, and other various means of production.

Our land has returned home, and we are working on our own land. We have built water conservancy projects and carried out drought resistance and pest control. The people of Xingguo County have decided to donate an "Xingguo" aircraft. Every household in our township has signed a patriotic production increase pledge to increase production by engaging in more sideline occupations, fish farming, pig raising, intensive cultivation, and meticulous farming. We originally planned to increase production by 15 million yuan, but we have now reached 28 million yuan. We hope that the "Xingguo" aircraft will soon fly to Korea to assist our heroic volunteers in annihilating the invading army of U.S. imperialism, consolidating our victory, and safeguarding world peace forever. Precisely for this purpose, we have also earnestly carried out the work of giving preferential treatment to revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, and disabled veterans. Since this spring, we have contributed 1,800 substitute labor days, and 143 households have received preferential treatment.

Dear Chairman Mao, we have made great progress in all aspects in the two years since liberation. But we strive to avoid pride and complacency, and we will surely seek further progress. We will surely respond to your call to "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory," using such actions to thank you for your concern. Wishing you good health!

The Entire Working People of Changgang Township, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province

We Eliminated the Feudal System
We Received Land and Became Masters of the Country
Dear Chairman Mao:

We are the representatives of the Old Revolutionary Base Area Representative Meeting of Xingan County, Jiangxi Province, formerly part of the Central Soviet Area. We thank you for your concern for the people in our old revolutionary base area. We represent all the people in the old revolutionary base area of Xingan County and extend to you our highest respects!

All seventy-five of us representatives participated in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army or the Soviet government in 1933. We have sweated and bled for the revolution. Since you led the Red Army north to resist Japan, many revolutionary comrades here have been brutally murdered by the Kuomintang reactionaries over the past dozen years. We struggled through extremely difficult environments. The Kuomintang reactionaries and their pawns, the landlord bullies, set fire to houses and tore them down, raped, and plundered, and seized all the land that you led everyone to distribute in the Jiangxi Soviet Area. Thinking of it now, everyone hates them very much!

In 1949, the People's Liberation Army you led fought heroically and liberated this area again. The people of Xingan County saw the light of day again and shouted, "Dawn has broken!" After liberation, under the leadership of the people's government, we eliminated the feudal exploitation system, received land, had houses to live in, had clothes to wear, and became masters of the country. Those counter-revolutionaries who deserved to be killed were killed, those who deserved to be imprisoned were imprisoned, and those who deserved to be supervised were supervised. None of them were allowed to speak or act recklessly. However, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, wanting to destroy our happy life and construction projects. We must do a good job in production, donate aircraft and artillery, do all our work well in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and resolutely assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, defeat the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and defend our fruits of victory.

Chairman Mao: We have nothing else to repay your concern, only to resolutely respond to your call: "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory." We guarantee that in all our work, we will carry forward the same spirit of hard work as we did in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, lead the masses, and complete our tasks. Chairman Mao! We have received the precious gifts you sent us. We are as happy as if we were seeing you in person. We will preserve these precious gifts forever. Finally, on behalf of the people in the old revolutionary base area of the entire Xingan County, we extend to you our highest respects once again!

"Seeing the Comrades of the Visiting Delegation
Is Like Seeing You in Person"
Dear Chairman Mao:

You care for the people in our old revolutionary base area and sent a visiting delegation to our area. We feel very honored. When we see the comrades of the visiting delegation, it's like seeing you in person.

Chairman Mao: In 1927, you personally led us in revolution here, and we were allocated land. Since you led the Red Army north to resist Japan, we have lived under the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, suffering the severe persecution of the reactionaries Xiao Fei Jiabi and the feudal evil landlord bullies. The land that we had been allocated was all taken back by them. Houses were burned down, and farm tools and cattle were looted. The reactionaries said that we were "bandits" and beat, hanged, and killed us indiscriminately every day, driving us to the point where we could not live in our homes.

Chairman Mao: Since you left here, we have been looking forward to you and the Red Army returning every day. In August 1949, Suichuan was liberated, and our own army truly returned. In the two years since liberation, under your leadership, we have actively participated in various revolutionary struggles—land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and other movements. We eliminated the feudal land system, became our own masters, actively engaged in production, and our lives are improving day by day. Here, we express our heartfelt gratitude to you! We must use practical actions to thank you. We must firmly remember your instructions, "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory!" We guarantee that in the future, we will play a leading and exemplary role in the revolutionary struggle and production and construction, unite the broad masses, and do everything well for the people.

Respectfully wishing you good health! And extending to you revolutionary greetings!

All the Old Red Army Soldiers of Xiluo, Fifth District, Suichuan County, Jiangxi Province

The People of Xibaipo Village, Jianping County
Constantly Think of Chairman Mao
Dear Chairman Mao:

I grew up in the overturn-the-landlord struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party and you. I remember before liberation, we only ate chaff and wild vegetables, but now we have surplus grain every year. One of my uncles is over fifty years old and has been a bachelor for most of his life. After the liberation, he got married. These are things that have never happened before.

Chairman Mao: The people in our village often think of the scenes when you lived here and are constantly thinking of you. My uncles and my seventy-year-old grandmother often ask me to write letters to greet you on their behalf. I was afraid of writing poorly and hadn't written yet, but I received your letter and you even sent someone to see us, which moved everyone in the village.

When I came to write this letter, an old woman said to me: "Tell Chairman Mao in the letter that I have a shortcoming, and I'm really sorry to him! That year when Chairman Mao lived in our village, there was a movie being shown, and because it was very crowded, some of us women with children couldn't see it, so I was unhappy. From then on, when people from the organizations came to borrow things from me, I got angry and wouldn't lend them. But after a few days, they showed the movie again for everyone, and we watched it. Every time I think about this, I feel like I was very wrong. Tell Chairman Mao that I want to resolutely correct my shortcomings."

Chairman Mao, we cannot repay your kindness. We can only do our best to move in the direction you have indicated, respond to all your calls, step up production, practice intensive cultivation and meticulous farming, and ensure that everyone does their job well. We will follow your instructions: "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory."

Respectfully wishing you good health!

Yan Tao, Xibaipo Village, Jianping County, Hebei Province

We Will Always Remember Your Words
These Are the Guiding Principles of Our Actions
Respected Chairman Mao:

In mid-August, the people in the old revolutionary base areas of Zhenghe, Songxi, and Shuiji counties in Fujian Province heard the news that the Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Delegation you sent was about to arrive here, and all of our people were eagerly looking forward to it. Sure enough, in late August, the visiting delegation arrived here and convened a meeting of representatives of the people and revolutionary martyrs' families and disabled workers in the old revolutionary base areas of Zhenghe, Songxi, and Shuiji counties, attended by more than 300 representatives. When we saw the comrades of the visiting delegation you sent, it was like seeing you in person. We were so happy that tears flowed from our eyes. We deeply know that you are very concerned about the lives and struggles of the people in our old revolutionary base areas. We sincerely thank you for your concern for us, and at the same time, we are also concerned about you day and night, concerned about the development of the Communist Party, concerned about the growth of the People's Liberation Army, and concerned about the new victories of the Chinese people's revolution.

Beginning in 1930, our old revolutionary base area has been carrying out revolutionary struggles under the leadership of the Communist Party. In 1933, we established the Soviet government and our own army here and implemented land reform. After the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the revolutionary struggle of the people in our old revolutionary base area entered a more difficult, arduous, cruel, and acute stage. But we still adhered to the struggle steadfastly. No matter how brutal and cruel the enemy was, our hearts were always with the Communist Party. We firmly believed that with your leadership, the revolution would surely be victorious.

Dear Chairman Mao: This time, you sent us an inscription, calling on us to "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory." We will always remember your words in our hearts. These are the guiding principles of our actions. We guarantee to you:

We will definitely use the spirit of overcoming difficulties and hard work in the past to rebuild our homes that were destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries with our own hands.

We will definitely invest all the relief grain issued by the government into production. We want to be self-reliant and never rely solely on government relief. We will definitely respond to your call with practical actions, work hard in production, actively do a good job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, donate aircraft and artillery, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and thoroughly implement land reform.

After the meeting, we will definitely bring your call and your concern for us to all the people in the old revolutionary base areas and every household of revolutionary martyrs' families and disabled workers, so that we can all execute your call together: "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory" to answer your concern for us! Wishing you good health!

The People and Representatives of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families and Disabled Workers in the Old Revolutionary Base Areas of Zhenghe, Songxi, and Shuiji Counties, Fujian Province

We, the Families of Martyrs, Military Dependents, and Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers,
Guarantee to Advance Forever Under Your Leadership
Respected Chairman Mao:

You care for us, the families of martyrs, military dependents, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and sent a visiting delegation to comfort us, tell us about the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the construction of the motherland, and also asked us with care and consideration about our production and lives, fearing that we would be frozen or hungry. Your concern for us moved us to tears. Seeing the comrades of the visiting delegation you sent is like seeing you. This visit gave us great comfort and encouragement, made us deeply appreciate the glory of being families of martyrs, military dependents, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and gave us infinite strength. We will definitely take your motherly feelings back to the village and tell all the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and all the people, so that everyone will be happy.

Chairman Mao: Please rest assured. Our production and life, under the leadership and help of the local government and with the care of the masses in the whole village, have been rising day by day. Some of our households had no houses or land in the past, but in the past few years, under your leadership, we have been allocated land and houses. For those who have no labor, the village also cultivates the land for them, and the planting is also doing well. Individual households still have some minor difficulties in clothing. But judging from the current situation, the crops this year are growing very well, and a good harvest is in sight; we can all wear new clothes next year.

Dear Chairman Mao: We can never forget your concern, we must respond to your call, "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory." We guarantee to you: We, the families of martyrs, military dependents, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, will never fall behind under your leadership. We will strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and strive to drive the American devils out of Taiwan and Korea as soon as possible. Finally, let us shout to you from afar: Long live Chairman Mao!

    发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣
    老根据地的广大人民
    纷纷写信感谢毛主席派人访问
    解放后我们有了很大进步
    我们仍力戒骄傲再求前进亲爱的毛主席：
    你派出的访问团，已来到我们长岗乡了。我们感谢你对我们的关怀。现在，我们把我乡在解放以来的情况向你报告一下。
    长岗乡解放两年多了。在你和各级党委、各级人民政府的领导下，我们先后进行了反霸斗争，土地改革，大生产运动，抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命等工作，获得了很大的成绩。
    在反霸斗争和土地改革中，经过我们的控诉和人民政府的判决，把当地最大的封建恶霸头子刘远嶟、锺传瑶、锺世艮父子等枪决了。十七户封建地主也斗倒了。我们从地主阶级手中争回了自己的土地，分得了七百多石稻谷，十九头耕牛，和其他各种生产资料。
    我们的土地回了家，我们在自己的土地上劳作。我们兴修了水利，进行了抗旱灭虫。我们兴国县全县人民决定捐献“兴国号”飞机，我们全乡每户都订了爱国增产公约，以多搞副业、养鱼、养猪、精耕细作来增加生产。我们原计划增产一千五百万元，现已达到二千八百万元。我们希望“兴国号”飞机很快地飞到朝鲜去，协助我们英勇的志愿军，歼灭美帝国主义的侵略军，巩固我们的胜利，保卫世界永久和平。也正是为了这个目的，我们又认真地进行了优待革命烈、军属和荣誉军人的工作。今年春季起，我们献了一千八百个代耕工，有一百四十三户受到了优待。
    亲爱的毛主席，解放两年多以来，我们在各方面都有很大进步。但我们力戒骄傲自满，我们一定再求进步。我们一定响应你的号召，“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，用这样的行动来答谢你对我们的关怀。祝你身体健康！
    江西省兴国县长岗乡全体劳动人民
    我们消灭了封建制度
    分得土地做了国家的主人亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是前中央苏区江西新淦县老根据地代表会的代表们，我们感谢您对我们老根据地人民的关怀。我们代表新淦县老根据地全体人民，向您致最崇高的敬礼！
    我们七十五名代表，都是在一九三三年参加过工农红军或苏维埃政府工作的。我们曾为革命出过汗、流过血。自从您率领红军北上抗日后，在这十几年中，这里很多革命同志，被国民党反动派残酷地杀害了。我们在极艰苦的环境中奋斗过来。国民党反动派及其爪牙地主恶霸放火拆屋，奸淫抢劫，把您在江西苏区时领导大家分得的田地，都夺去了，到现在想起来，人人都痛恨万分！
    一九四九年您领导的人民解放军英勇战斗，又解放了这个地区——新淦县的人民重见天日，高呼“天亮了”！解放后，我们在人民政府领导下，消灭了封建剥削制度，分得了田地，有屋住，有衣穿，做了国家的主人。我们对那些反革命分子，该杀的杀了，该关的关了，该管的管了，一个都不准乱说乱动。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗国民党残余匪帮，还继续与中国人民为敌，想破坏我们的幸福生活和建设事业。我们一定要搞好生产，捐献飞机大炮，做好一切抗美援朝工作，并坚决协助政府镇压反革命。打败美帝国主义的侵略，保卫我们的胜利果实。
    毛主席：我们没有什么别的东西来报答您的关怀，只有坚决响应您的号召：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣。”我们保证在各种工作中，发扬以前在工农红军中那样艰苦的精神，带动群众，完成任务。毛主席！您送给我们的珍贵的礼物，我们已经收到了。我们像见到您的面一样地高兴。我们要永远保存这些珍贵的礼物。最后，我们代表新淦全县老根据地的人民再向您致最崇高的敬礼！
    江西省新淦县首届老根据地代表会全体代表
    “看到了访问团的同志
    就好像看到了您一样”亲爱的毛主席：
    您关怀我们老根据地的人民，派访问团到我们这里来。我们感到非常光荣。我们看到访问团同志，就好像看到您一样。
    毛主席：一九二七年，你在这里亲身领导我们革命，我们分得了土地。自从你领导红军北上抗日后，我们生活在蒋介石匪帮的反动统治下，受尽反动派萧匪家璧及封建恶霸地主的严重残害。我们分到的土地曾全被他们倒算回去。房屋被烧毁了，农具、耕牛被抢走了。反动派说我们是“土匪”，天天乱打、乱吊、乱杀，赶得我们不能在家安身。
    毛主席：自你离开这里后，我们天天盼望着你和红军回来。一九四九年八月，遂川解放了，我们自己的军队真正回来了。解放二年来，在您的领导下，我们积极地参加各种革命斗争——土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝等运动。我们消灭了封建的土地制度，自己当了家作了主，积极生产，生活一天一天的改善了。在这里，我们向您致衷心的感谢！我们要用实际行动来答谢您。我们一定要牢牢记住你的指示，“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣！”我们保证今后在革命斗争和生产建设事业中，起带头作用和模范作用，团结广大群众，办好一切人民的事。
    敬祝身体健康！并向您致革命的敬礼！

    建屏县西柏坡村人民
    时时想念毛主席亲爱的毛主席：
    我是在共产党和您的领导下，在翻身斗争中长大起来的。记得在解放前，我们尽是吃糠咽菜，现在年年有馀粮了。我的一个伯伯五十多岁了，大半辈子打光棍，翻身后，他就结婚了。这都是从来未有过的事。
    毛主席：我们村上的人们时时想起您在这里住时的情景，时时在惦记着你。我的叔叔伯伯们和我七十岁的老奶奶都常常要我写信代他们问候你。我怕写不好，还未写，但是却接到了你的信，并且还派了人来看我们，乡亲们个个很感动。
    当我来写这封信时，有一位老大娘对我说：“信上要告诉毛主席，我有个缺点，真对不住他呀！那年毛主席在咱村上住时，有一次演电影，因为人很挤，我们一些带孩子的妇女没看到，我就不高兴。从此机关上的人来借我的东西时，我就发脾气，不借给。可是不多几天，又给大家演了一次电影，我们看了。每次想起这件事，就觉得自己太不对。告诉毛主席，我要坚决纠正自己的缺点。”
    毛主席，你的恩情我们无以报答，只有尽我们最大的努力，朝着你所指示的方向，响应你的一切号召，加紧生产，作到精耕细作，并保证各人把各人的一切工作作好。我们听从你的嘱咐：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。
    敬祝身体健康！
    河北省建屏县西柏坡村  阎涛
    我们永远记住您的话
    这是我们行动的指针敬爱的毛主席：
    八月中旬，我们福建省政和、松溪、水吉三县老根据地的人民，听到您派遣的南方老根据地访问团即将到达我们这里的消息，我们全体人民都兴高采烈地盼望着。果然，八月下旬，访问团就到达我们这里，并召开了三百多个代表参加的政和、松溪、水吉三县老根据地人民及烈军工属代表会议。我们看到您派来的访问团的同志，就好像看到您本人一样。我们高兴得流出眼泪。我们深深地知道，您是十二分关怀着我们老根据地人民的生活和斗争。我们衷心感谢您对我们的关怀，同时我们也是日日夜夜关心着您，关心着共产党的发展，关心着人民解放军的壮大，关心着中国人民革命的新胜利。
    从一九三○年开始，我们这块老根据地就在共产党的领导下进行着革命斗争。一九三三年，我们这里就建立了苏维埃政府和自己的军队，并实行了土地改革。从红军北上抗日后，我们这块老根据地人民的革命斗争就进入更困难、更艰苦、更残酷、更尖锐的阶段。但是我们仍然是坚强不屈地坚持斗争。不管敌人是如何的残暴和惨酷，我们的心一直向着共产党。我们坚信，有您的领导，革命就一定要胜利的。
    亲爱的毛主席：这次您送给我们题词，号召我们
    “发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，我们把您的话永远记在心头，这是我们行动的指针。我们向您保证：
    我们一定用过去克服困难艰苦奋斗的精神，用我们自己的双手来重建我们被国民党反动派所破坏的家园。
    我们一定把政府发下的救济粮全部投入生产中去。我们要自力更生，决不单纯依靠政府救济。我们一定以实际行动来响应您的号召，努力生产，积极做好抗美援朝工作，捐献飞机大炮，坚决镇压反革命，澈底实行土地改革。
    开完会后，我们一定把您的号召和您对我们的关怀带给全体老根据地人民和每一户烈军工属，让我们大家一齐来执行您的号召：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”来回答您对我们的关怀！祝您健康！

    老根据地人民及烈军工属代表会议
    我们烈属军属和革命残废军人
    保证在您的领导下永远前进敬爱的毛主席：
    您关心俺们烈属、军属、革命残废军人，派了访问团来慰问俺们，告诉俺们抗美援朝运动和祖国建设的情形，又关怀体贴地问俺们的生产和生活怎样，怕俺们受了冻挨了饿。您对俺们的关心，使俺们感动得流下泪来。俺们见了您派来的访问团同志，就和见了您一样。这次访问给俺们很大的安慰和鼓舞，使俺们更深地体会到烈属、军属和革命残废军人的光荣，给俺们增加了无限的力量。俺们一定把您那慈母一样的心情，带回村去告诉所有烈属军属、革命残废军人和全体人民，让他们大家都高兴。
    毛主席：请您放心。俺们的生产和生活在当地政府的领导帮助下，在全村群众的照顾下已逐日上升。俺们当中有些户过去没有房子、没有地，几年来在您的领导下都已分到了土地和房屋。没有劳动力的，村里又给代耕着，种的也都不错。个别户在穿衣上还有一些小困难。但是就现在看，今年的庄稼长的很好，丰收在望；俺们来年就都可以穿上新衣裳。
    亲爱的毛主席：俺们永远也不能忘记了您的关怀，俺们一定响应您的号召，“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，俺们向您保证：俺们烈属、军属和革命残废军人在您的领导下是永远不会落后的。俺们将加强抗美援朝的工作，争取早日把美国鬼子赶出台湾和朝鲜去。最后，让俺们遥远地向您高呼：毛主席万岁！
