    Zhejiang's Mid-Season Rice Harvest 20% Higher Than Last Year
    Sichuan's Rice Crop Expected to Yield 80-90% Harvest

    Xinhua News Agency: Zhejiang Province has achieved another bumper harvest of mid-season rice, with yields universally 20% higher than last year. As of late August, various parts of the province had begun harvesting mid-season rice in succession, with the Jininhua Special District, which started reaping earlier, having already completed the harvest. The average yield of mid-season rice in each county of the special district was 486 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 920 jin per mu. The entire special district will yield more than 270 million jin than last year. This bumper harvest has made the farmers who newly received land particularly happy. Farmers who previously had no land now have their houses piled high with golden rice. They excitedly said, "Before, after the autumn harvest, we were busy paying rent to the landlords, but now we are all busy selling grain to the cooperatives!"

    Xinhua News Agency: A bumper harvest of rice is expected in the Southwest Region. This year, the four administrative districts of eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and northern Sichuan planted more than 54.7 million mu of rice, with an expected harvest of approximately 80% to 90%. The average yield of rice in western Sichuan is expected to be 420 jin per mu. In some areas of Guizhou and Xikang provinces, the rice has already headed due to even rainfall. Currently, farmers in the region are actively purchasing agricultural tools and other supplies in preparation for the harvest. Farmers in eastern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and northern Sichuan have already begun harvesting rice.

    浙江省中稻又获丰收，收成普遍比去年高二成。八月下旬，该省各地已陆续开始收割中稻，开镰较早的金华专区已经收割完毕。该专区各县中稻每亩平均收四百八十六斤，最高的达到九百二十斤，全专区比去年能多收二亿七千多万斤。这次丰收使新分得土地的农民特别高兴。从前没有土地的农民，现在屋子里都堆满了金黄色的稻谷。他们兴奋地说：“从前秋收以后我们就忙着向地主交租，现在却都忙着向合作社卖谷呢！”
