The People Who Create Miracles
    ——In Memory of the Workers and Laborers at the Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate Construction Site

    Three months ago, twelve red characters, as large as tabletops, shone on the Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate construction site: “Ensure the Project is Completed on Time, Send Good News to Chairman Mao.” This was the battle cry of the more than 40,000 workers, laborers, technicians, and cadres building the gate, and it was also the source of infinite power.

    In mid-June, when the “River-Blocking Gate” project was progressing to its most intense stage, it suddenly started raining heavily. For the sake of the project, the workers of the Cement Brigade persisted in operating the mixers and pushing the small iron wheelbarrows full of cement at top speed. The harder it rained, the greater their enthusiasm. Worker Gu Xilang’s leg was cut by a reinforcing bar, leaving an inch-long gash, and Xu A Mao’s foot was bruised. Fearing that going back to apply medicine would delay them, they simply tore strips of cloth from their clothes to bandage the wounds and insisted on working. They said:
    “No difficulty can scare us workers. We will definitely not leave the construction site for minor injuries.”

    The flood season was approaching day by day, and the task became more urgent. The Huai River Harnessing Committee issued a solemn call: “Guarantee completion before the flood season,” “Only success is allowed, failure is not,” “Be heroes of the people, not criminals of the people.” Every unit and every individual worked with even greater intensity.

    Zhang Zhongshan, of the Third Squad of the Stonework Brigade, was an old worker in his fifties. He usually carried stones, specifically looking for large ones weighing two hundred catties. As a result, people called him "Old Man Red." During work, a boil the size of an egg grew on his stomach. After the doctor operated on him, he told him that he would need to stay in the hospital for at least seven days. However, he arrived at the construction site one day after the operation. The squad leader asked him why he was working so hard. He said: “Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, my family has suffered from floods year after year. The Kuomintang also conscripted men and collected donations, leaving me without a single day of peace. Today, I have been allocated land, and my son has also married a wife. I am willing to live honestly for another fifty years and enjoy the good days of the new world. I cannot allow floods to mess with us again."

    After days of continuous rain, the river water suddenly rose by three feet, and the "River-Blocking Dam" closure project became the overriding task. Leading cadres decided to rush the closure overnight in the rain. Soldiers from the Fifth Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army guarding the construction site also voluntarily participated in the closure project. "Comrades! Keep up the good work! Carry stones this year, carry bags of wheat next year!" the soldiers encouraged the laborers. Upon hearing this, the laborers unanimously replied: "In order to repair the Huai River, we will definitely give our all." After three days and nights of labor, all the workers, laborers, and soldiers successfully completed the closure task at dawn on "July 1st." After completing the closure task, everyone began to carry out the intense gate construction project. Young soldier Zhu Changfa, who had just returned from the battalion headquarters after delivering a letter on a hot day, was already very tired. The squad leader and comrades asked him to rest, but he insisted on carrying stones at the construction site. Sun Xueqin, a laborer from the transportation brigade, couldn't even go home when his mother died. Communist Youth League member Wang Fucai received a letter from home asking him to go home to get married, but he said: "Marriage is a small matter, harnessing the Huai River is a big matter. I will not go home to get married until the dam is repaired." In this way, after three months of day and night labor, the diversion sluice gate project was finally completed victoriously before the flood season.

    "Repair the gate, hang red flowers, model heroes are praised by everyone." At the celebration meeting, decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers and resounding with gongs and drums, there were more than eight hundred heroes wearing red ribbons. They all emerged from this project. They are the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland, the people who conquer nature and create miracles. The people warmly congratulate them, because they have responded to Chairman Mao's model with practical actions: "We must harness the Huai River well."

    创造奇迹的人们
    ——追记润河集分水闸工地的工人和民工
    羡泉
    三个月前，在润河集分水闸工地上闪耀着桌面大的十二个红字：“工程不误期，喜报送给毛主席。”这是建闸的四万余工人、民工、技术人员和干部们的战斗口号，也是无穷力量的泉源。
    六月中旬，当“拦河闸”工程进展到最紧张的阶段，天却忽然下起大雨来。洋灰大队的工人们，为了工程的需要，却始终坚持地开着拌和机，推着盛满洋灰的小铁轮车飞跑，雨下得愈紧，大家的劲头也愈大。工人顾西朗的腿，被钢筋划破了寸把长的口子，徐阿毛的脚碰破了，他们怕回去上药耽误时间，只是撕破衣襟布扎住，坚持干活。他们说：
    “什么困难都不能把我们工人吓倒，受点轻伤绝对不下工地。”
    汛期一天天迫近，任务一天比一天紧。治淮委员会提出了“保证汛期前完工”、“只许成功，不许失败”、“要做人民的功臣，不做人民的罪人”的庄严号召。每个单位、每个人都更百倍紧张地干了起来。
    石工大队三中队的张仲山，已是五十多岁的老工人。他平时扛石头，专找二百斤重的大石块。因此人们都叫他“老来红”。工作中，他肚子上长了个鸡蛋大的毒疮，医生给他开刀后，告诉他，至少要七天才能出院。他却在开刀后一天就到了工地上。中队长问他为什么这样拼命干？他说：“从民国二十年起，我家就连年遭受水灾，国民党还抽丁捐款，弄得我没过一天安生日子；今天我分到了土地，儿子也娶上了媳妇，我愿意老老实实地再活五十年，过过新世道的好日子，不能让洪水跟咱再捣乱。”
    连日阴雨，河水陡涨三尺，“拦河坝”的堵口合龙工程已成为压倒一切的任务。领导干部决定冒雨连夜突击堵口，守卫工地的解放军某团五连战士也自动参加了堵口工程。“同志们！加油呵！今年扛石头，明年扛麦袋！”战士们这样鼓励着民工们，民工们听了就一致回答：“为了把淮河修好，我们一定拿出我们全部的力量。”全体工人、民工、战士经过了三昼夜的劳动，在“七一”的黎明，胜利地完成了堵口任务。完成堵口任务后，全体人员又开始进行紧张的建闸工程。青年战士朱长发，大热天从营部送信刚回来，本来已经很疲乏，班长和同志们都叫他休息，他坚决要到工地上扛石块。搬运大队的民工孙学勤，母亲死了也顾不得回家。青年团员王福才家里来信要他回家去结婚，他却说：“结婚是小事，治淮是大事，不把闸坝修好，就不回家结婚。”这样经过三个月来日日夜夜的劳动，分水闸工程终于在汛期前胜利竣工了。
    “修好闸，挂红花，功臣模范人人夸”。在张灯结彩锣鼓喧天的庆功会上，有八百多位披红挂花的功臣们。他们全是在这次工程中涌现的。他（她）们是祖国的优秀儿女，是征服自然创造奇迹的人们。人民热烈地庆贺他们，因为他们是用实际行动响应了毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的模范。
