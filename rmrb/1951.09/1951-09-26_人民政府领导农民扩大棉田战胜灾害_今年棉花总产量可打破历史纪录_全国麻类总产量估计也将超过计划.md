    Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: The major cotton-producing areas across the country are now picking cotton, and new cotton is already on the market. According to the estimation of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, judging from the planting area of cotton this year, the growth of cotton, and the existing harvest situation, if no more unexpected disasters occur, the average cotton yield per mu will increase by three jin of ginned cotton compared to last year, and the total national output may exceed the original plan and break historical records.
    In order to ensure the supply of China's textile industry, this spring, farmers across the country responded to the call of the People's Government and expanded cotton planting. Therefore, this year China's cotton planting areas have expanded throughout the country, even to many places in Heilongjiang Province north of 45 degrees north latitude, where cotton has been tried. The cotton field area in the past cotton-producing areas has been further expanded, with cotton fields in Hebei Province alone reaching 17.96 million mu. This year's national cotton field planting area also exceeds the plan, and the expansion of cotton fields is the basic reason for increased production.
    Throughout the summer, the cotton seedlings in various places generally grew well. Cotton farmers took great care in their management to strive for a bumper harvest. However, this year some cotton fields in some areas suffered from drought, and almost all cotton fields in the country suffered from cotton aphids. In North China, especially Hebei Province, the severity of cotton aphid damage this year exceeded any previous year. Only after the People's Government issued a large number of medicines and sprayers, and led the farmers to vigorously eliminate and control them, did they save the cotton field harvest. Judging from the current situation, the cotton area in southern Shanxi is the best. Irrigated cotton fields can harvest 250 to 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, and dry land can harvest 150 jin. The cotton fields of the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group in Jie County can harvest an average of 540 jin of seed cotton per mu. The cotton fields in Shijiazhuang, Handan, Hengshui and other areas of Hebei Province can harvest 200 jin of seed cotton per mu. The cotton area in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, also had a good harvest this year, generally being able to harvest more than 250 jin per mu in irrigated cotton fields and 120 jin in dry land. The cotton output in Hubei cotton area this year will be much higher than last year. In the provinces of Pingyuan and Shandong, a few cotton fields have reduced production due to insect pests or rain disasters, and some have even completely failed, but most cotton fields will have a good harvest. Cotton fields around Xinxiang and Anyang will have a bumper harvest. The cotton fields around Shanzhou in Henan Province have a bumper harvest, and other places can reach the planned output. The cotton in northern Anhui is also better than last year. The cotton in northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, and coastal Zhejiang was destroyed by typhoons, and except for Zhejiang's bumper harvest, the rest can only reach the average yield. In addition, the cotton fields in Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces in Northeast China, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces in Northwest China, various provinces and regions in Southwest China, and provinces south of the Yangtze River are all considerable this year; among them, except for Hunan and Jiangxi, where the harvest is not good due to drought, the rest of the places are good.
    Now, except for some areas in Northeast and Northwest China, all places have started large-scale cotton picking, and many cotton farmers have expressed that they will sell all the new cotton to the state.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: This year, the main hemp-producing areas in the country, such as Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, have achieved bumper harvests of hemp production. The highest yield of jute in Zhejiang is 500 jin per mu, and the highest yield of kenaf is more than 600 jin, with an average of about 300 to 400 jin. The improved hemp in Jiangxi Province yields an average of more than 300 jin per mu. The hemp in Yongfeng County, Jiangxi Province, has a maximum yield of 530 jin. It is estimated that the total output of hemp fiber in Jiangxi Province this year can reach 230,000 dan, an increase of one time compared with last year. In addition, jute in southern Jiangsu can yield 250 to 300 jin per mu, and ambary hemp in northern Anhui can yield 200 jin per mu. The hemp in North China is also good this year. Kenaf in Xinxian and Xingxian areas of Shanxi Province yields about 240 jin per mu, and kenaf in Hebei Province yields about 270 jin per mu. Due to the spring drought, each mu of kenaf in Pingyuan Province can only harvest 50 to 60 jin. The kenaf planted on a trial basis in Gansu and Ningxia in the Northwest this year is growing well and may have a bumper harvest. It is estimated that the amount of hemp harvested in Northeast China this year can also be self-sufficient.
    The above-mentioned various coarse fiber hemps are the raw materials for machine-woven burlap bags. In the past, due to the lack of raw materials, China often imported burlap bags from abroad. This year, the People's Government called for expanding the planting of industrial raw material crops, and the area planted with hemp has increased in various places; the sowing area of hemp throughout the country has exceeded the plan a lot, and it is estimated that the total output will also exceed the plan.

    人民政府领导农民扩大棉田战胜灾害
    今年棉花总产量可打破历史纪录
    全国麻类总产量估计也将超过计划
    【新华社二十四日讯】全国主要产棉区目前均已收摘棉花，新棉已经上市。据中央人民政府农业部估计，就今年种棉面积、棉花生长情况和已有的收获情况来看，如果不再发生意外的灾害，每亩棉田平均将比去年增产三斤皮棉，全国总产量可超过原订计划，并打破历史纪录。
    为了保证供应我国纺织工业的需要，今年春天，全国农民响应人民政府的号召，扩大植棉。因此，今年我国种棉地区扩及全国，连北纬四十五度以北，黑龙江省的许多地方都试种了棉花。过去的产棉区棉田面积更加扩大，河北一省的棉田即达一千七百九十六万亩。今年全国棉田种植面积亦超过计划，棉田扩大是增产的基本原因。
    整个夏天，各地棉苗生长情况一般是好的。棉农莫不加意经营，争取丰收。但是，今年部分地区的棉田曾遭遇旱灾，几乎全国的棉田都发生过棉蚜。华北，特别是河北省，今年棉蚜为害的严重程度超过以往任何一年，经人民政府发出大批药剂和喷雾器，领导农民大力加以除治，才挽救了棉田的收获。就目前的情况来看，晋南棉区最好，能够灌溉的棉田每亩可收籽花二百五十斤到三百斤，旱地可收一百五十斤。解县曲耀离互助组的棉田平均每亩可收籽棉五百四十斤。河北省石家庄、邯郸、衡水等地区的棉田，每亩可收籽花二百斤。陕西关中棉区今年收成也好，一般能灌溉的棉田，每亩可收二百五十斤以上，旱地可收一百二十斤。湖北棉区今年产量将超过去年很多。平原、山东两省的棉田，都有少数因虫害或雨灾减产，甚至有完全失收的，但大部分棉田将获得好收成。新乡、安阳一带的棉田将得到丰收。河南省陕州一带的棉田丰收，其他各地可达到计划产量。皖北的棉花今年也比去年好。苏北、苏南、浙江沿海一带的棉花，因受台风摧毁，除浙江丰收外，其余只能达平年的产量。此外，东北辽东、辽西等省，西北甘肃、宁夏、新疆等省，西南各省区和长江以南各省今年棉田都不少；其中除湖南、江西因旱收成不好以外，其他各地都不错。
    现在除东北和西北部分地区外，各地都已大规模收摘棉花，许多棉农表示要把全部新棉卖给国家。
    【新华社二十四日讯】今年全国主要产麻区浙江、江西等省的麻产都得到了丰收。浙江黄麻每亩最高收五百斤，洋麻最高收六百斤以上，平均约三、四百斤。江西省的改良麻，平均每亩收三百多斤。该省永丰县的麻，最高收五百三十斤。估计江西全省今年麻皮总产量可达二十三万担，比去年增产一倍。此外，苏南区的黄麻每亩可收二百五十斤到三百斤，皖北区茼麻每亩可收二百斤。华北各省今年的麻也不错，山西省忻县、兴县一带的洋麻每亩约产二百四十斤，河北省的洋麻每亩约产二百七十斤。平原省因春旱，每亩洋麻只能收五、六十斤。西北甘肃、宁夏今年试种的洋麻，生长良好，可能丰收。东北今年麻的收获量，估计也能自给。
    上述各种粗纤维麻类，为机织麻袋的原料。过去由于原料缺乏，我国常自国外输入麻袋。今年人民政府号召扩大播植工业原料作物，各地种麻面积都增加了；全国麻类的播种面积超过计划很多，估计总产量也将超过计划。
