The CCP North Sichuan Regional Committee is currently paying attention to strengthening the political and ideological education of farmers. In early August, the committee held its first regional propaganda work conference, focusing on studying the ideological situation of farmers after the land reform, and taking the strengthening of ideological education for farmers as one of the major tasks of propaganda work in the future.

In the areas of North Sichuan Region where land reform has been completed, the political consciousness of farmers has generally improved, and they have enthusiastically launched the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and engage in patriotic production. A vigorous new atmosphere has emerged in the countryside. However, due to insufficient ideological education for farmers, an erroneous ideological tendency of "everything is fine after land reform" and "only willing to produce, not interested in politics" has begun to grow among farmers. Some rural cadres have even developed the idea of "changing shifts," believing that since the land reform is completed, the revolution has succeeded, farmers will produce on their own, and we should take a break.

The North Sichuan Region Propaganda Work Conference studied these ideological situations and decided to strengthen the political and ideological education of farmers in both the areas where land reform has been completed and the areas where land reform is underway. The education methods are: First, large-scale rotational training of rural cadres, and educating the vast number of farmers through rural cadres. It is planned to rotate and train 120,000 rural cadres this winter and next spring. Second, establish and improve the propaganda network, and use the propaganda network as an important organizational form for regularly educating farmers. In addition, ideological education will be carried out through mass learning organizations such as farmers' night schools and reading groups during the inspection and revision of patriotic covenants.

### 中共川北全区宣传工作会议  决定加强对农民的思想教育

    中共川北全区宣传工作会议
    决定加强对农民的思想教育
    中国共产党川北区委员会现正注意加强对农民的政治思想教育工作。该会于八月上旬曾召开第一次全区宣传工作会议，着重研究了土地改革后的农民思想情况，并把加强对农民的思想教育作为今后宣传工作的重大任务之一。
    川北区完成土地改革地区的农民政治觉悟普遍提高，热烈地展开了抗美援朝、镇压反革命和爱国生产运动。农村中出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。但由于对农民的思想教育不够，农民中开始滋长着一种“土地改革完成，万事大吉”，“只愿生产，不问政治”的错误思想倾向。有些农村干部更产生了“换班”的思想。他们认为：土地改革完成了，革命成功了，农民自己会生产，我们该歇一歇了。
    川北区宣传工作会议研究了这些思想情况，决定在土地改革完成地区和正在进行土地改革的地区，都加强对农民的政治思想教育。教育方法：第一、大规模轮训农村干部，通过农村干部教育广大农民。计划在今冬明春轮训十二万农村干部。第二、建立和健全宣传网，把宣传网作为经常教育农民的重要组织形式。此外，在检查与修订爱国公约中，通过农民夜校、读报组等群众学习组织进行思想教育。
