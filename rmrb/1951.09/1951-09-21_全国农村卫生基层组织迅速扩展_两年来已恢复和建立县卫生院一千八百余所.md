    Rapid Expansion of Rural Health Organizations Nationwide
    Over 1,800 County Health Centers Restored and Established in the Past Two Years
    In the past two years, rural health organizations at the grassroots level nationwide have been rapidly restored and established, and rural health work is gradually unfolding.
    The county health center has been the focus of strengthening and developing rural health organizations at the grassroots level over the past two years. According to statistics, as of April 1951, 1,841 county health centers had been restored and established nationwide, accounting for 84.3 percent of the total number of counties in the country; many provinces and regions, such as Zhejiang, Shandong, Hunan, Shaanxi, Hebei, the entire Northeast region, and four administrative offices in Sichuan, now have health centers in every county. In the past, the vast number of farmers across the country were long threatened by epidemics and diseases and could not receive health and medical care. During the more than 20 years of reactionary Kuomintang rule, the highest statistical figure for county health centers nationwide was 1,445. These health centers actually only provided some medical services to a small number of wealthy people in the county towns, and about half of these health centers were severely damaged before liberation in various places. For example, in the entire Northwest region, only 52 county health centers remained at the time of liberation; all of the original county health centers in Henan Province were destroyed. The county health centers restored and established in the past two years are not only much more numerous than during the Kuomintang rule, but also have greatly improved in terms of equipment. According to statistics, the number of beds in county health centers has increased by 121.8 percent compared to the highest statistics during the Kuomintang rule, and the number of county health workers has increased by 46 percent.
    Establishing rural health organizations at the grassroots level is a prerequisite for carrying out rural health work. Therefore, in April 1951, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Strengthening and Developing National Health Organizations at the Grassroots Level," and in May, the National Medical and Administrative Work Conference adopted the "Implementation Measures for Strengthening and Developing Rural Health Organizations at the Grassroots Level." However, the country's financial and economic situation is still difficult at present, and there is a severe shortage of health cadres. Therefore, we can only engage in restoring and focusing on the construction of county health centers, district health stations, and specialized prevention and treatment stations; in addition, we must organize the masses to establish cooperative medical and preventive institutions.
    The organization of district health stations hardly existed during the Kuomintang rule. In the past two years, although the focus of rural health organization construction has been on restoring and establishing county health centers, considerable attention has also been paid to the work of establishing district health stations. According to incomplete statistics as of April 1951, there are already 953 district health stations nationwide. In individual regions, such as the Northeast and other health experimental counties, some administrative villages have established health sub-stations or health stations. In the North China region, the organization of medical and pharmaceutical cooperatives is widespread, and this type of organization has played a significant role in medical and preventive work.
    According to incomplete statistics, 115 specialized prevention and treatment stations (institutes) for various diseases, 425 maternal and child health stations (teams), 39 maternal and child health centers, 536 midwifery stations, and 114 medical and epidemic prevention teams, health engineering teams, etc., have been established nationwide (including urban and industrial and mining areas). These institutions are mainly located in areas where infectious diseases are prevalent, disaster areas, and ethnic minority areas, and have made great achievements in preventing and controlling various diseases, carrying out rural maternal and child health, assisting in the establishment of health organizations at the grassroots level in various places, and training primary health cadres.
    Mass health organizations are an important organizational form for relying on the masses and serving the masses. At present, the organization of health committees (or epidemic prevention committees) at all levels below the county is very common. This type of organization plays a significant role in curbing the prevalence of epidemics and carrying out seasonal health campaigns. In addition, mass organizations of health personnel, such as health workers' associations or medical and pharmaceutical federations, have been established in more than 50 percent of the counties in the Northeast and other regions. These organizations have exerted great strength in educating, reforming, and uniting health personnel, improving their professional level, and assisting the people's government in carrying out epidemic prevention and health care work.
    The establishment of rural health organizations at the grassroots level has first of all achieved great results in the prevention and control of epidemics. Secondly, it has also played a certain role in carrying out maternal and child health work, improving environmental and personal hygiene, increasing the masses' health knowledge, and reducing the incidence and mortality of diseases.

### 全国农村卫生基层组织迅速扩展  两年来已恢复和建立县卫生院一千八百余所

    全国农村卫生基层组织迅速扩展
    两年来已恢复和建立县卫生院一千八百余所
    两年来，全国农村卫生基层组织正迅速恢复与建立中，农村卫生工作也正逐步展开。
    县卫生院是两年来健全与发展农村卫生基层组织的重点。据统计，截至一九五一年四月，全国已恢复和建立的县卫生院有一千八百四十一所，占全国总县数百分之八十四点三；许多省区如浙江、山东、湖南、陕西、河北、东北全区和四川的四个行署现在每县都有卫生院。过去全国广大农民长期受着疫疠和疾病的威胁，得不到卫生医药的照顾。国民党反动政府统治的二十多年中，全国县卫生院的最高统计数字是一千四百四十五所。这些卫生院实际上只是为县城中少数富有的人做了一点医疗工作，而这些卫生院在各地解放前，约有半数遭到了严重的破坏。例如西北全区在解放时，只剩下县卫生院五十二所；河南省原有的县卫生院，全部遭受破坏。两年来，恢复和建立的县卫生院不仅比国民党统治时期增加很多，而且在设备上也有很大的改善。据统计，县卫生院的床数较国民党统治时期的最高统计增加了百分之一百二十一点八，县卫生工作人员数增加了百分之四十六。
    建立农村卫生基层组织是开展农村卫生工作的先决条件。因此，中央人民政府卫生部于一九五一年四月发布了《关于健全和发展全国卫生基层组织的决定》，五月全国医政工作会议并通过了《健全与发展乡村卫生基层组织实施办法》。但目前国家财政经济仍处于困难情况，卫生干部又很缺乏，因此只能从事恢复和重点建设县卫生院、区卫生所和专业性的防治站所；另外，组织群众建立合作性质的医疗预防机构。
    区卫生所的组织，在国民党统治时期几乎是没有的。两年来，农村卫生基层组织的建设重点虽然放在恢复与建立县卫生院上，但对建立区卫生所的工作也相当重视。据截至一九五一年四月的不完全统计，全国区卫生所已有九百五十三所。个别地区，如东北及其他地区的卫生实验县中，已有部分行政村建立了卫生分所或卫生站。华北地区普遍地有医药合作社的组织，这种组织在医疗和预防工作上都起了很大的作用。
    专业性的防治机构，据不完全统计，全国（包括城市及工矿区）已建立各种疾病的防治站（所）一百一十五个，妇幼保健站（队）四百二十五个，妇幼保健所三十九所，接生站五百三十六个，医疗防疫队、卫生工程队等一百一十四个。这些机构主要设立在传染病流行地区、灾区和少数民族地区，在防治各种疾病、开展农村妇幼卫生、协助各地建立卫生基层组织、培养初级卫生干部等方面，都有很大的成绩。
    群众性的卫生组织，是依靠群众并为群众服务的重要组织形式。目前县以下的各级卫生委员会（或防疫委员会）的组织是很普遍的。这种组织对于遏止疫病的流行，开展季节性的卫生运动，有很大的推动作用。此外，卫生工作者协会或医药联合会等卫生人员的群众团体，在东北各县和其他地区百分之五十以上的县都建立起来了。这些组织在教育、改造和团结卫生人员，提高他们的业务水平，协助人民政府开展防疫保健工作等，都发挥了很大的力量。
    农村基层卫生组织的建立，首先在疫病的防治上，收到了很大的效果。其次，在开展妇幼卫生工作，改善环境卫生和个人卫生，提高群众的卫生常识，减少疾病的发生率和死亡率方面，也起了一定的作用。
