    Strengthen the Publicity and Education of the Marriage Law
    The letters concerning marriage issues published in today's newspaper once again illustrate that many rural cadres still harbor serious feudal ideas and confused concepts regarding marriage. They adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards incidents of interference with freedom of marriage and maltreatment of women; some even directly interfere with others' freedom of marriage and directly maltreat women. Their actions have created extremely bad influence among the masses. For example, the Eighth District People's Government of Qihe County, Shandong Province, ignored the case of Jia Xiangju, a woman from Yuanjia Township in the district, who was forced to commit suicide. The local masses were very dissatisfied. Jia Yanmei, a woman from Dadaicun in the district, said: "The government often holds meetings, saying things like equality between men and women and freedom of marriage, but now they don't care at all when a woman is forced to death!" Xu Wengao, the deputy head of Gongbei Township in Huai'an County, Northern Jiangsu, abused his wife, and Cong Ruike, a cadre from Anxi County, Fujian, interfered with freedom of marriage, driving two people to their deaths, which are direct criminal acts violating the Marriage Law. Such serious incidents are not isolated cases nationwide.
    The confused thoughts of cadres and the masses regarding marriage issues must be clarified, and the Marriage Law must be implemented. Leading organs in various regions should strengthen the education of the vast number of cadres on the Marriage Law, and through them, conduct in-depth publicity of the Marriage Law to the masses. This is the key to implementing the Marriage Law. Governments at all levels should seriously handle incidents of cadres violating the Marriage Law that have already occurred in accordance with the law, and use typical facts to educate all cadres and the masses. Only in this way can the Marriage Law be effectively implemented and a new democratic marriage system be established.

### 加强婚姻法的宣传教育

    加强婚姻法的宣传教育
    今天本报发表的几篇关于婚姻问题的来信，再一次说明了仍有很多乡村干部，在婚姻问题上，还有严重的封建思想和糊涂观念。他们对干涉婚姻自由和虐待妇女的事件，采取袖手旁观的态度；甚至直接干涉他人婚姻自由，直接虐待妇女。他们这种行动，在群众中造成的影响是极恶劣的。如山东齐河县八区人民政府，对该区袁家乡妇女贾象菊被迫自杀一案，竟置之不理。当地群众非常不满。该区大代村妇女贾延美就说：“政府经常开会，说什么男女平等、婚姻自由，现在妇女被逼死了全不管！”苏北淮安县拱北乡副乡长许文高虐待自己的妻子，福建安溪县干部丛瑞科干涉婚姻自由逼死两条人命，更是直接侵犯婚姻法的犯罪行为。而这种严重事件，在全国范围内并不是个别的。
    干部、群众关于婚姻问题的混乱思想必须澄清，婚姻法必须贯彻实施。各地领导机关应该对广大干部加强婚姻法的教育，通过他们向群众进行深入的婚姻法宣传，这是贯彻婚姻法的关键。各级政府对于已经发生的干部违反婚姻法的事件，应该依法认真处理，并用典型事实教育全体干部和群众。这样，才能有效地贯彻婚姻法，建立新民主主义的婚姻制度。
