    "Preparing to Be a Mother" Book Contains Poisonous Elements; Should Cease Publication
    To the Editors:
    "Preparing to Be a Mother," one of the books in the "Mother and Child Series" published by Shanghai Home Publishing House, is a book containing poisonous elements.
    For example, the article "Reducing Maternal Mortality Rate" in the book promotes how the American imperialist educational authorities—the Health Bureau of Flint, Michigan—are "excellent," and how the Obstetrics Research Association and the Maternal Health Foundation are enthusiastic about "social service work." The editor even says in the editor's note at the end of the article: "This kind of work in caring for mothers and implementing maternal education is related to every family. China urgently needs to launch and promote this kind of work, and hopes that people from all walks of life can pay attention to it." As we all know, the United States' cultural, educational, and health work serves the bourgeoisie, and the poor working people cannot enjoy it. However, the author of this article openly praises it and asks us to "learn" from it. Can this be tolerated?
    For example, the article "New Methods of Conception" says that a woman named Betty could not get pregnant because she had a "husband's temperament," which hindered her pregnancy. Later, her husband insisted that she give up her job and stay at home to adopt a child; as a result, she became more "feminine" and soon became pregnant. This is the "new method of conception"! Is this kind of open advocacy of women giving up their jobs and returning home to get pregnant in any way consistent with the provision of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that "women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life"?
    Furthermore, the article "Unraveling the Mystery of Infertility" says: "If a family has no children, the parents-in-law will scold the daughter-in-law for being unfilial, and the husband will also use this as an excuse to marry a concubine." The article "New Methods of Conception" says, what is a "good husband"? It is one who has "a good position and gorgeous clothes." May I ask, do these fallacies conform to the laws and morals of New China in any way!
    In short, "Preparing to Be a Mother" is an extremely harmful book. The "Mother and Child Series" of Home Publishing House has a considerable sales volume, and many of the other books also have the same serious errors. In order to prevent the spread of various erroneous ideas, I believe that Home Publishing House must re-examine and deal with these books and conduct a thorough review.

### “做母亲的准备”一书含有毒素应停止发行

    “做母亲的准备”一书含有毒素应停止发行编辑同志：
    上海家出版社发行的妇幼丛书之一“做母亲的准备”，是一本含有毒素的书。
    例如，该书“减低产妇死亡率”一文，就是宣扬美国密歇根州芙林特城美帝国主义的教育当局——健康局如何“良好”，产科研究会和产妇健康基金会是如何热心于“社会服务工作”的。编者更在文末的按语中说：“这一类照顾产妇和实施母职教育的工作，与每一家庭可说都有关系。中国实在急切需要发动和推进这一类的工作，希望社会人士，能够注意及之。”众所周知，美国的文教卫生工作是为资产阶级服务的，穷苦的劳动人民是享受不到的，而该文作者竟如此公然为它吹嘘，并要我们向它“学习”，这难道是可以容忍的吗？
    又如，该书“受孕新法”一文说，有个名叫贝蒂的妇女，因有“丈夫气”，妨碍了她的怀孕；后来她的丈夫坚持要她放弃工作，留在家里，领个义子；于是她就更“女性化”，不久就怀孕了。这就是“受孕新法”！这一种公开宣传妇女放弃工作回到家里去的“受孕新法”，难道与中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的“妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利”的规定，有丝毫相同之点吗？
    再如，该书“解剖不生育之谜”一文说：“一个家庭没有孩子，为公婆的会骂媳妇不孝，为丈夫的也会藉口娶一个小老婆。”该书“受孕新法”一文说，什么是“不错的丈夫”呢？就是他有“一个很好的职位，华丽的服装”。试问这种谬论难道与新中国的法律和道德有丝毫符合之处吗！
    总之，“做母亲的准备”是一本极端有害的书籍。家出版社的妇幼丛书，颇有销路，而除此之外，其他各书中很多也都有着同样严重的错误。为了杜绝各种错误思想的传播，我认为家出版社必须将这些书籍重新加以审查处理，并进行深刻的检讨。
