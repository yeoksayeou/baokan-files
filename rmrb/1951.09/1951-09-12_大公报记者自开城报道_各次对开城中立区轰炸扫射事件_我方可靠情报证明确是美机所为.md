    *Ta Kung Pao* Reporter Reports from Kaesong
    Our Reliable Intelligence Proves US Aircraft Were Responsible for All Bombing and Strafe Attacks on the Kaesong Neutral Zone

    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th] *Ta Kung Pao* reporter Zhu Qiping filed a dispatch from Kaesong on the 11th: The reporter has just learned from authoritative sources that our side has obtained reliable intelligence confirming that the bombing and strafing incidents in the Kaesong neutral zone on August 22nd, September 1st, and September 10th were indeed carried out by US aircraft. The intelligence also confirms that the so-called stationing of an entire division of our troops and tank units in Kaesong is purely fabricated by the US side, with the aim of using this as a pretext for US aircraft to conduct bombing and strafing raids on the Kaesong neutral zone at night. The US side's despicable and barbaric bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone is intended to threaten and intimidate our side into submitting to its unreasonable demands regarding the military demarcation line proposed at the negotiation meetings. After the serious provocative incidents of US aircraft bombing and strafing the Kaesong neutral zone occurred, the US side repeatedly stubbornly, yet contradictorily, denied that their aircraft had bombed or strafed the Kaesong neutral zone, even ridiculously claiming that these incidents were "deliberately manufactured" by our side. However, now, after the investigation of the strafing incident in Kaesong by the US "United Nations Command" liaison officer and journalists on September 10th, the truth has come to light, and it is impossible for the US side to deny it any longer. Therefore, after the investigation on the 10th, US officers had no choice but to have Colonel Welch, a press officer of Ridgway, declare: "The news about a large number of communist troops remaining in the Kaesong neutral zone during the ceasefire negotiations has not been confirmed."

    大公报记者自开城报道
    各次对开城中立区轰炸扫射事件
    我方可靠情报证明确是美机所为
    【新华社十一日讯】大公报记者朱启平十一日开城专电：记者顷自权威方面获悉：我方已获有可靠情报，证实八月二十二日、九月一日及九月十日各次对开城中立区的轰炸、扫射事件都确实是美方飞机所为。情报亦证实：所谓开城驻有我方整师部队及坦克部队，亦纯系美方捏造，其目的是要以此作为美国飞机于夜间出动对开城中立区实行轰炸扫射的藉口。美方卑鄙野蛮地以飞机轰炸开城中立区之目的，是为了威胁和恫吓我方对其在谈判会议中所提出的关于军事分界线的无理要求屈服。美方飞机轰炸、扫射开城中立区的严重挑衅事件发生后，美方曾一再死硬地、但又是矛盾百出地否认他们的飞机曾轰炸扫射开城中立区，甚至荒唐无比地声称这些事件是我方“故意制造”出来的。但是现在经过九月十日美方“联合国军”联络官及新闻记者来开城调查扫射事件后，真相已经大白，美方要想狡赖已经不可能了。因此，美方军官在十日调查后，就只好由李奇微的新闻处官员魏尔奇上校声明说：“关于在停火谈判期间有大批共军留驻在开城中立区的一条消息没有得到证实。”
