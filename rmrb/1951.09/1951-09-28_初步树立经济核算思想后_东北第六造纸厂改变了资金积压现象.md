After the Sixth Northeast Paper Mill of the Northeast Light Industry Bureau began to value business management, the phenomenon of capital accumulation gradually changed. In the past, the factory did not pay attention to capital management, never studied ways to improve capital management, and whenever it ran out of funds and materials, it would ask for them from higher authorities, and in large quantities. However, it did not manage well the capital occupied during the production process. The factory did not care about product sales, believing that product sales were the responsibility of higher authorities and had nothing to do with the factory itself. In the second half of last year, the factory implemented independent accounting and established settlement relations with the bank, but the relations with the higher authorities were not resolved. It received materials from higher authorities without paying, and it did not turn over the financial tasks that should have been turned over on time. Under the dominance of this supply-based thinking, the serious phenomenon of capital accumulation and poor capital turnover occurred. Last year, the factory's stagnant capital was equivalent to the average material needs of forty-two days.

Lack of Economic Accounting Thinking Led to Serious Capital Accumulation

The factory did not store materials according to production needs, resulting in a large accumulation of materials. The factory's production plan was unrealistic, resulting in the accumulation of 150 tons of flax and hemp pulp, 130 tons of waste cotton, 535 tons of cement, and about 75 tons of steel. Most of the materials transferred from basic construction to production could not be used for production and had to be accumulated. For this reason, 700,000 red bricks and 20 tons of iron were accumulated.

The failure to pay attention to economic accounting resulted in many products not being sold, resulting in a large accumulation of capital. In the second half of last year, the factory produced ticket paper that was uneven in thickness, resulting in the accumulation of more than 200 tons; whiteboard paper was accumulated about 300 tons because the paper surface was uneven; and Grade A and B wood-free paper was accumulated more than 170 tons because the thickness was too great. This stagnant capital was equivalent to the factory's output of thirty-eight days.

Strengthening Economic Accounting Education and Starting to Pay Attention to Capital Management

In August of last year, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held an industrial conference, which criticized this lack of economic accounting thinking. In September of last year, during the rectification movement, the factory put forward the slogan of opposing waste and practicing thrift, and began to pay attention to capital management. In February of this year, the Northeast Light Industry Bureau held a joint meeting of factory directors. In accordance with the spirit of the meeting, based on last year's experience and lessons, the factory actively studied the laws and theories on capital management, and conducted research in light of the actual situation of the factory. It also convened a factory management committee to study capital management issues, made a resolution on how to accelerate the turnover of working capital, and reported to workshop directors and section cadres to criticize the supply system thinking. Therefore, this year the factory has made significant progress in capital management. Last year, the average capital turnover of the factory was 2.09 times, or 172 days; at the end of the first quarter of this year, the turnover accelerated to 2.98 times, or 120 days; and at the end of the second quarter of this year, the turnover accelerated further to 3.89 times, or 92 days, an average increase of 85.2 percent compared with last year. The amount of working capital occupied this year has also obviously decreased. Compared with the amount occupied at the end of last year as the base, the amount occupied in the first quarter of this year decreased by 37.8 percent, and in the second quarter by 41.2 percent.

Actively Clean Up Inventory Materials

After the above study and discussion, the factory carried out a series of tasks in business management. First, the factory thoroughly cleaned up the inventory of accumulated materials this year and formulated a disposal plan. At the end of last year, although the factory had conducted a clean-up of accumulated materials, it only cleaned up the main materials, and the accumulation of all materials was not fully understood. At the beginning of this year, the factory's reserve funds accounted for 53.8 percent of the total funds. Calculated according to the factory's production needs in January of this year, it was enough for 139 days of use, which shows that this reserve period was too long. The factory discovered this waste and stipulated the reserve quota of main materials according to the material consumption quota, and checked the inventory materials based on this reserve quota. Those exceeding the quota were disposed of. Those below the quota were replenished. For general consumables without a quota, they were checked according to their regular inventory and monthly income and expenditure dynamics. In order to thoroughly clean up the inventory materials, the factory mobilized workers and technicians to cooperate with warehouse management personnel to do this work. Through such cleaning, the factory found that the capital occupied by stagnant materials reached 42 percent of the factory's reserve funds at the beginning of this year. It can be seen that cleaning up inventory materials is very important for accelerating capital turnover.

Do a Good Job in the Procurement of Seasonal Materials

Secondly, the factory paid attention to improving the procurement methods of seasonal materials. In the past, the factory's approach to seasonal materials was to "purchase them all at once and use them gradually," resulting in the accumulation of a large amount of capital. Having learned this lesson, the factory changed this capital-binding method. In addition to maintaining a regular reserve, it signed contracts with suppliers based on daily production needs, stipulating "successive deliveries, completion within a time limit, and daily settlement," which not only did not accumulate a large amount of capital, but also saved a lot of expenses and losses. For example, when purchasing straw this year, the use of this new procurement method reduced capital accumulation by more than 590 million yuan. Credit reduction reduced the interest paid on credit by more than 4 million yuan. The reduction in the natural loss rate by 11 percent saved 69 million yuan. Because the goods were delivered on the same day and unloaded directly to the production workshop, 33 million yuan was saved in factory transportation costs. This can save more than 100 million yuan in expenses.

Pay Attention to Shortening Transportation Time

Strengthening transportation management and shortening transportation time are issues that must be paid attention to in order to reduce capital accumulation. In the past, the factory's transportation tools, except for automobiles which were controlled and distributed by the supply section, were managed by each branch factory, and the supply section could not directly distribute them. Therefore, it was necessary to hire additional vehicles every month to transport materials. In terms of railway transportation, the transportation personnel only had a simple transportation perspective, did not understand the production situation, did not distinguish between priorities, and waited for the railway bureau to give cars. In response to these shortcomings, the factory first decided to unify the management of transportation tools by the supply section, which greatly improved transportation efficiency and no longer needed to hire external vehicles, saving more than 5 million yuan in transportation costs every month. There were also improvements in railway transportation. After the transportation task was assigned, they immediately set off and immediately went through the procedures for picking up and consigning goods at the pick-up location to ensure that the goods were transported back within the prescribed time limit, which shortened the transportation time and reduced the accumulation of capital by more than 230 million yuan. In addition, the reporting system for transportation personnel was strengthened. For example, after transportation personnel accepted a task with a large transportation volume, they reported the completion of the task to the factory on a daily basis to avoid a large amount of capital being accumulated in the transportation process.

Strengthen Sales Work and Reduce Product Accumulation

Strengthening sales work and strictly implementing contracts are the keys to avoiding product accumulation. Last year, the factory's accumulated products were completely resolved in the first quarter of this year with the help of the Northeast Industrial Department and the Light Industry Bureau through production and sales contracts. This year, the factory's products have basically not experienced accumulation. The main key is to carry out production under the state's unified production plan and to carry out distribution under the unified distribution plan, and to strictly implement the sales contract system. In order to prevent over-produced products from being accumulated, at the beginning of each month, based on the trend of production development, the over-produced quantity for the month is estimated and the higher authorities are requested to allocate them in advance. In addition, strengthen communication with users and solicit users' opinions on products at any time in order to make timely improvements. This has resulted in the factory's product capital occupation amount at the end of the second quarter of this year being reduced to only one-quarter of the occupation amount at the end of last year.

Strictly Implement Income and Expenditure Plans

Strictly implement income and expenditure plans and strengthen the control of working capital expenditures. For the past six months, the factory has basically followed the plan in terms of financial income and expenditure. Expenses that are not planned are not allowed to be spent. At the beginning, the factory's plan was not accurate, and many difficulties occurred, but the management and use of working capital still played a good role. Later, in order to further correct the income and expenditure plan, the factory formulated financial management methods and implemented them to workshops and departments through the factory management committee. In order to effectively use and adjust funds, a ten-day income and expenditure plan was also established. This played a significant role in the use of funds. Therefore, the factory has been able to repay bank credit on time and complete the tasks of submitting payments on schedule for the past six months.

### 初步树立经济核算思想后  东北第六造纸厂改变了资金积压现象

    初步树立经济核算思想后
    东北第六造纸厂改变了资金积压现象
    东北轻工业管理局第六造纸厂重视经营管理以后，过去积压资金的情况就逐渐改变了。该厂过去不注意资金管理工作，从不研究改进资金管理的办法，没有经费和材料了，就向上级要，而且要的很多。但对生产过程中所占用的资金，却不很好地加以管理。该厂不关心产品的推销，认为推销产品是上级的事情，与自己工厂没有关系。去年下半年该厂实行了独立会计，和银行建立了结算关系，但和上级的来往关系却没有解决。向上级领料不缴款；应该上缴的财政任务不按期上缴。在这种供给制思想支配下，该厂资金积压和周转不灵的严重现象就发生了。去年该厂呆滞的资金，相当四十二天的平均材料需要量。
    缺乏经济核算思想，资金积压现象严重
    该厂不根据生产需要来储备材料，因此积压了大量的材料。该厂的生产计划不切实际，积压了线麻和麻浆一百五十吨，废棉一百三十吨，水泥五百三十五吨，钢材约七十五吨。该厂从基本建设方面转到生产方面的材料，大部分不能用于生产，只得积压下来。因为这个原因，积压了七十万块红砖和二十吨铁。
    不注意经济核算的结果，使许多产品销不出去，因此积压的资金是很多的。去年下半年，该厂制造的车票纸因厚度不匀，积压了二百多吨；白板纸因纸面不平，积压了三百吨左右；甲、乙模造纸因厚度太大，积压了一百七十多吨。这笔呆滞的资金，相当该厂三十八天的产量。
    加强经济核算的教育，开始注意资金管理
    去年八月，中共中央东北局召开工业会议，批判了这种缺乏经济核算的思想。去年九月在整风运动中，该厂提出反对浪费，厉行节约的口号，开始重视资金管理工作。今年二月东北轻工业管理局召开厂长联席会议，该厂依照会议的精神，根据去年的经验教训，积极地学习了关于资金管理的法令和理论，并联系该厂实际情况进行研究。还召开工厂管理委员会，研究了资金管理问题，作了关于怎样加速流动资金周转的决议，并向车间主任和各科干部作报告，批判供给制思想。因此，今年该厂在资金管理上就有了显著的进步。去年该厂资金平均周转二点零九次，一百七十二天；今年第一季末周转加速，达到二点九八次，一百二十天；今年第二季末周转更加速到三点八九次，九十二天；比去年平均提高周转率百分之八十五点二。今年流动资金占用额亦显然减少，如以去年末占用额作基数来比较，今年第一季占用额就减少百分之三十七点八，第二季减少百分之四十一点二。
        积极清理库存材料
    经过上述学习讨论，该厂在经营管理上做了一系列的工作。首先，该厂在今年彻底清查了库存积压材料，并制定了处理计划。去年年底，该厂虽做过一次清理积压材料的工作，但只清理了主要的材料，对于全部材料的积压情况，还不完全了解。今年年初，该厂储备资金竟占资金总额的百分之五十三点八，如以今年该厂一月份生产需要来计算，足够一百三十九天之用，由此可见，这个储备期是太长了。该厂发现了这种浪费情况，就根据材料消费定额，规定了主要材料的储备定额，并以这个储备定额为根据，检查库存材料。对于超过定额的，就加以处理。对于低于定额的，则加以补充。对于一般没有定额的消耗材料，就根据其经常的库存量和每月收支动态，来进行检查。为了彻底地清理库存材料，该厂动员了工人和技术人员，配合仓库管理人员，来做这一工作。通过这样的清理，该厂发现呆滞材料所占用的资金竟达该厂今年年初储备资金的百分之四十二。由此可见，清理库存材料，对于加速资金周转是很重要的。
        做好季节性材料的采购工作
    其次，该厂注意了改进季节性材料的采购办法。过去该厂对季节性材料是“一次购齐，陆续使用”，因此积压大量资金。该厂接受了这个教训，就改变了这个束缚资金的办法，除了保有经常的储备量外，根据每天生产需要，和货主签订“陆续交货，限期交齐，当日结算”的合同，这样既不会大量积压资金，还节省了很多费用和损失。如今年采购稻草时，用这种新的采购方法，就使资金少积压五亿九千余万元。因为信贷减少而减付信贷利息四百余万元。因为自然耗损率减少百分之十一，节省了六千九百万元。因为当日交货，直接卸至生产车间，节省厂内运输费三千三百余万元。这样就能节省开支一亿余元。
    注意缩短运输时间
    加强运输管理和缩短运输时间，是减少资金积压必须注意的问题。该厂运输工具，过去除汽车由供应科掌握分配外，马车均由各分厂管理，供应科不能直接分配，因此，每月均需另外雇车运料。在铁路运输方面，运输员只有单纯的运输观点，不了解生产情况，不分轻重缓急，铁路局给车就运，不给车就等着。针对这些缺点，该厂首先决定由供应科统一管理运输工具，使运输效率大为提高，再不需雇用外车，每月节省运费五百多万元。铁路运输也有改进，在运输任务布置下来以后，就马上出发，到达提货地点立即办理提货托运等手续，保证在规定限期内把货物运回，这样就缩短了运输时间，减少积压资金二亿三千余万元。此外，还加强了运输员的汇报制度，如运输员接受了运输数量多的任务后，逐日将任务完成情况报厂，以免大量资金积压在运输过程中。
    加强推销工作，减少产品积压
    加强推销工作，严格执行合同，是避免产品积压的关键。去年该厂积压的产品在东北工业部与轻工业管理局的帮助下，通过产销合同，在今年第一季内全部解决了。今年该厂的产品，基本上没有发生积压现象，其主要关键是在国家统一生产计划下进行生产，在统一分配计划下进行分配，并严格执行推销合同制度。为了使超产产品不致积压，在每月初旬根据生产发展的趋势，推算出本月超产数量，提前请求上级分配。此外，加强与用户的联系，随时征求用户对于产品的意见，以便及时改进。这就使得该厂今年第二季末产品占用资金额降低到仅等于去年底占用额的四分之一。
    严格执行收支计划
    严格执行收支计划，加强流动资金支出的控制。该厂半年来在财务收支方面，基本上是按照计划办事的。没有计划的费用，一律不准开支。在开始时，该厂订的计划不确切，发生了不少困难，但对于流动资金的管理和运用，还是曾起了不少好的作用。后来该厂为了进一步使收支计划正确，就制订了财务管理办法，经过工厂管理委员会贯彻到车间及各部门去。为了有效地运用和调剂资金，还建立了旬收支计划。这在资金运用上起了很大的作用。因此，该厂半年来对银行信贷，能按时偿还；对上缴任务，也能按期完成。
