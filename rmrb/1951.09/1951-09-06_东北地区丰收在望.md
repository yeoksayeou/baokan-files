    Northeast China Region Anticipates a Bumper Harvest

    Farmers in various parts of Northeast China, amidst the patriotic production increase campaign, have successively overcome various natural disasters since the spring plowing season, completed the spring sowing and summer hoeing plans on schedule, implemented deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and carried out technical improvements such as fertilization and seed selection. Currently, except for some flood-affected areas, crops are growing vigorously. Cotton topping and pruning have been completed, with plants generally reaching over two feet in height, laden with cotton bolls, and a bumper harvest is anticipated. According to recent typical investigations, the average cotton yield per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen Chinese mu) in Liaodong Province this year is expected to exceed last year's 118 jin (seed cotton). Liaoxi Province is also expected to exceed last year by a significant amount. Some cotton bolls have already begun to burst with fiber. Cotton farmers are smiling and preparing to welcome the cotton harvest. Many mutual aid teams in cotton-producing areas have written letters to factories, thanking the worker brothers for timely manufacturing of medicines and equipment to help them eliminate pests, ensure a bumper harvest, and expressing their intention to sell all the cotton to the state. This year, rice is growing more vigorously than last year, generally exceeding three feet in height, with rice ears uniformly emerging. Sorghum in various regions generally reaches about seven and a half feet in height, with ears seven to eight inches long, and has begun to blush. Corn generally bears two large cobs, and the red silks have generally turned black. Millet is over three feet tall, with ears generally over six inches long, and the grains are generally firm and full.
    According to recent typical investigations in various regions, the average harvest for the entire region this year is expected to be over 80%. For example, Liaodong Province is expecting a 90% harvest, and it is preliminarily estimated that the province's total grain output has exceeded the original planned figure. Liaoxi Province, except for a few flood-affected counties and districts, is expected to have at least an 80% harvest. Jilin Province, which had the most abundant harvest last year, has even stronger crops in the eastern region this year than last year, with the lowest rice yield being 5,400 jin per hectare. Songjiang Province is also expected to have an average harvest of over 90%. According to a typical investigation in Linkou County of this province, the average yield per hectare is 4,800 jin for corn, 3,900 jin for sorghum, 3,200 jin for millet, and 2,100 jin for soybeans, all significantly exceeding last year. Heilongjiang Province, which experienced a more severe spring drought this year, is also expecting an average harvest of 70% to 80%. The main crop in Rehe Province is millet, and this year's yield per hectare is expected to be 200 jin more than last year.
    Encouraged by the anticipated bumper harvest, farmers in various regions are actively carrying out fertilizer accumulation and seed selection, making material preparations for striving for an even greater bumper harvest next year.

    东北地区丰收在望
    东北各地农民在爱国主义丰产运动中，接连战胜了春耕以来的各种自然灾害，按时完成了春播与夏锄计划，实行了深耕细作，贯彻了施肥选种等项技术的改进工作，目前除部分水灾地区外，庄稼生长旺盛。棉花打尖打杈已全部结束，一般每株高达二尺以上，棉桃累累，丰收在望。据最近典型调查，辽东省今年棉花每垧（一垧合十五市亩）平均产量可超过去年一百一十八斤（籽棉），辽西省亦能比去年超过很多。部分棉桃现已开始裂絮，棉农喜笑颜开，正准备迎接棉花丰收。产棉区很多互助组，纷纷写信给工厂，感谢工人弟兄及时制造药械协助他们消灭了虫害，保证了丰收，并表示要把棉花都卖给国家。今年水稻比去年长得更旺，一般已三尺多高，稻穗普遍抽齐。各地高粱一般均高达七尺半左右，穗长七寸到八寸，已开始晒红米。苞米一般均挂两个大棒，红缨普遍转黑。谷子高三尺多，穗长普遍在六寸以上，谷粒普遍坚实饱满。
    根据最近各地典型调查，今年全区年成平均可望八成以上。如辽东省有九成年景，据初步估计，全省粮食总产量已超过原计划数字。辽西省除少数水灾县区外，最低的可望有八成年景。去年最丰收的吉林省，今年东部地区庄稼比去年还强，其中水稻每垧产量最低的也有五千四百斤。松江省平均也可有九成多年景。据该省林口县典型调查，苞米每垧平均产量四千八百斤，高粱三千九百斤，谷子三千二百斤，大豆二千一百斤，都超过去年很多。今年春旱较严重的黑龙江省，平均也有七成到八成年景。热河省主要作物为谷子，今年每垧可比去年多打二百斤。
    在丰收在望的鼓舞下，目前各地农民正在积极进行积肥选种，为明年争取更大的丰收作好物质准备。
