Reader's Letter:

    We must eliminate the influence of the "Wu Xun Spirit"
    To the Editor:
    After studying the documents criticizing Wu Xun, all teachers, students, and staff of Wu Xun Complete Primary School in Linqing Town have significantly improved their ideological understanding and urgently request the town government to promptly dispose of all Wu Xun relics in our school and change the school's name. Since the first publication of documents criticizing Wu Xun in the newspapers, it has immediately aroused the concern and attention of all teachers and students in our school, especially the teachers. Subsequently, under the leadership of Principal Li Yuetang, we discussed the Wu Xun issue, which has given us a further understanding of Wu Xun, this historical sinner. We have come to know that Wu Xun's begging for the sake of establishing schools was not for poor children, and he never intended to do anything for poor children. Begging was merely a concrete manifestation of his hooliganism, laziness, and parasitic ideology. When Wu Xun embarked on his so-called "begging to establish schools," it was precisely when peasant leader Song Jingshi was leading peasants in the Linqing, Tangyi, and Guantao areas in a movement against grain taxes and levies, giving the corrupt Qing army and the cannibalistic landlord armed forces – the Liulin Band – a heavy blow. At this time, Wu Xun was precisely bowing and kowtowing to these enemies of the peasant class, and playing many despicable and lowly tricks to deceive the masses. How can such a shameless degenerate who willingly relied on class enemies, walked the enemy's path, and served as the enemy's slave be worthy of being called a role model for people? This is simply a great insult to us. Now our school is a school for the masses, a school that serves the children of workers and peasants, and a school that serves the cause of New Democratic cultural education under the leadership of the Communist Party. Our school must no longer be named after "Wu Xun," this shameful name. All thirty members of our staff and more than one thousand students request the local people's government and cultural and educational leading organs to promptly eliminate all existing Wu Xun relics in our school and change the name of our school to completely eliminate the residual influence of the Wu Xun spirit.
    All staff and students of Wu Xun Complete Primary School, Linqing Town, Hebei Province

### 我们要肃清“武训精神”的影响

    我们要肃清“武训精神”的影响编辑同志：
    我们临清镇武训完小全体师生员工，在学习了关于批评武训的文件之后，思想认识有了显著提高，迫切地要求我镇人民政府迅速处理我校所有武训遗迹与更换我校的校名。自报纸上第一次登载了批评武训的文件以后，立刻引起了我们全校师生，尤其是教员同志们的关怀与注意，此后即在校长李岳堂同志的领导下，讨论了武训问题，使我们对于武训这个历史罪人，已有了进一步的认识。我们已知道武训的要饭兴学，并不是为了穷孩子，而且他从来就没替穷孩子打算过，要饭不过是他的流氓、懒惰与寄生思想的具体表现。当武训走向所谓“行乞兴学”的时候，正是农民领袖宋景诗领导农民在临清、堂邑、馆陶一带进行抗粮抗捐运动，给腐败透顶的满清军队与吃人的地主武装——柳林团以沉重的打击的时候，而武训这时恰好在给这些农民阶级的敌人作揖磕头，还玩了许多卑鄙下贱的花样以迷惑群众。像这种甘心依靠阶级敌人，走敌人的道路，当敌人的奴才的无耻败类，又怎样能配称人们的榜样呢？这简直是对我们莫大的侮辱。现在我们学校是人民大众的学校，是为工农子弟服务的学校，是在共产党领导之下为新民主主义文化教育事业服务的学校，我们的学校决不能再以“武训”这个可耻的名字来命名了。我们全体员工三十名，学生一千余人，要求当地人民政府文教领导机关迅速取消我校内现存的一切武训的遗迹，更换我们学校的名字，来彻底肃清武训精神的残余影响。
    河北省临清镇武训完小全体员工学生
