Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation movement, the Chinese working class, under the fighting slogan of "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the weapon," has initiated a vigorous patriotic production upsurge. Chinese textile workers have further proposed their specific slogans of "One loom is one cannon, one spindle is one gun" in the patriotic production movement. They know that only by producing more, donating more, and building strong economic and national defense forces can we smash the aggression of American imperialism. Only by winning the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea, can we build a prosperous and strong New China, and improve the lives of the people and ourselves. The textile workers across the country have launched patriotic labor competitions with high patriotic enthusiasm. In the past winter, some areas launched a movement to donate weapons. In January of this year, textile workers in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin voluntarily donated wages to purchase airplanes, and this movement was fully launched in Qingdao. With the rising tide of patriotism, the labor competition in the textile system has entered a new stage. In addition to the widespread launch of group competitions in factories across the country, all employees in Northeast China, Tianjin, and Qingdao, as well as some employees in Shanghai and Southwest China, have also participated in regional competitions. Over the past few months, through this labor competition, textile production has achieved great results. In the first quarter of this year, national state-owned cotton textile mills completed 110.06 percent of the cotton yarn task and 106.96 percent of the cotton cloth task. Other wool, linen, silk weaving, knitting, printing and dyeing, machinery, chemical, and bobbin factories have been able to complete their tasks on time, and many factories have overfulfilled their tasks month after month. Some silk reeling factories in southern Jiangsu have created a new record of four A’s in silk reeling quality (silk reeling quality has more than ten grades, which were previously expressed in English letters such as ABC, with A being the best quality. In the past, the general quality only reached one or two A’s. In January of this year, the quality of Wuxi Huachang Silk Factory reached four A’s, the highest record in the country – Xinhua News Agency note).

In the labor competition, the masses of workers and staff have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity. In the first quarter alone, 3,228 rationalization proposals were put forward in various places, which played a great role in improving production. In particular, the creation of the Hao Jianxiu work method in Qingdao State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 6 pointed out a new direction for improving textile production. Chinese textile production will produce more wealth for the country and save more social labor due to the creation of this work method, thus further strengthening the power to resist America and aid Korea. In short, resisting America and aiding Korea has become the driving force of the production movement, and the masses of workers and staff have closely integrated resisting America and aiding Korea with production.

In the patriotic movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending the nation, the textile trade union organizations at all levels, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have done a lot of work and achieved great results. However, our trade union work is not done enough, the education work is not deep and wide enough, and it has not made every worker and staff member realize the important significance of resisting America and aiding Korea from their own lives. They are not good at closely integrating the general task of resisting America and aiding Korea with various tasks. Some trade union cadres isolate resisting America and aiding Korea, and regard resisting America and aiding Korea and doing a good job in production as two different things. A factory in March this year carried out the movement to resist America and aid Korea in a vigorous manner, but it was not well integrated with production. The substandard cloth rate was always around 3.3 percent. After discovering this shortcoming, they simply emphasized anti-substandard cloth and launched a "major cleanup" in the factory, sweeping away the slogans and cartoons of resisting America and aiding Korea. They did not combine resisting America and aiding Korea to make the masses realize the political significance of anti-substandard cloth and its close relationship with every employee, so as to eliminate substandard cloth. Instead, they proposed that "The factory director is anxious to cry, the engineer is anxious to scratch his head, and everyone should quickly find a way to eliminate substandard cloth." As a result, the masses' level of political understanding was not improved, and production could not develop steadily on the basis of mass consciousness. Taking the donation of airplanes and cannons as an example, some cadres did not have a clear understanding of the significance of increasing production and donating, and simply thought that donation was "taking money out of their pockets." They failed to lead the workers to formulate specific plans for increasing production and donating, resulting in the disconnection between donation and increased production. Due to the insufficient integration of resisting America and aiding Korea with production and the lack of clear understanding of increasing production and donating, the patriotic conventions lacked specific content. Not only were they not good at closely integrating resisting America and aiding Korea with production, but they were also not specifically integrated with the lives of the masses. Some cadres, in leading production, did not pay enough attention to improving labor conditions, and failed to use the power of the masses to assist the administration or capitalists to improve labor conditions according to today's economic conditions, thus affecting the health of workers. The occurrence of this situation is due to the trade union's insufficient attention to the health of workers on the one hand, and the lack of a strong mass perspective on the part of administrative cadres on the other hand. They do not know that appropriately improving labor conditions is an important factor in doing a good job in production. In terms of using the hardship member subsidy to help members solve their living difficulties, the trade union organizations in Qingdao, Tianjin, Wuhan and other places have done a better job, won the support of the members, and closely linked the trade union with the members. This is a concrete manifestation of our trade union's concern for the lives of workers. However, some places believe that the hardship member subsidy decided by the Second National Committee is too small, and simply deposit the money in the bank, while others transfer it to office expenses or cultural and recreational expenses. They do not know that allocating 20 percent of the membership fee has exhausted the greatest strength of our textile trade union today, and this money should be used to play its due role. They do not know that the improvement of the lives of workers and staff is to be achieved gradually by doing a good job in production and exerting all possible forces, but they fantasize about improving their lives very well all at once. Some of our cadres have not clearly realized that in today's situation, it is the most practical way to gradually improve the lives of workers by exerting the power of the masses. The masses have realized today's difficulties and know that they must concentrate all their strength to resist America and aid Korea. Their requirements for life are not high, and even partial improvements are satisfactory to the masses. However, some cadres will not proceed from reality to meet the legitimate demands of the masses, so our trade union is divorced from the masses. In short, there are still shortcomings in our work in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and these shortcomings must be overcome in order to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

The movement to resist America and aid Korea has achieved great victories. Over the past ten months, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have eliminated more than 200,000 invading troops of the United States and its accomplices, forcing American imperialism to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to hold armistice negotiations. However, American imperialism has not changed its aggressive policy because of its defeat. American imperialism is still not sincere about peace negotiations, and at the same time, it openly stated that it will continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan and actively arm Japan. The security of the motherland is still under serious threat. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea and smash the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism. We should know that our victory today has been achieved through arduous struggle. Only by continuing to wage a resolute struggle and smashing the aggression of American imperialism can we achieve lasting peace. Continuing to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea and striving for the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea is the primary political task of the people of the whole country, and it is also the primary political task of our textile workers. We must continue to mobilize all textile workers to fight to complete this task, and we must closely integrate political tasks with economic tasks, and contribute all the strength of textile workers in the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

Therefore, we must carry out patriotic and internationalist education more deeply and extensively, further improve the class consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of textile workers, and make every textile worker know the important significance of resisting America and aiding Korea, and clearly recognize the greatness of the power of the Chinese people. Since the Chinese people can overthrow the rule of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek in China and establish their own regime, they can win the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea, defend the fruits of the revolutionary victory, and build an independent and prosperous New China. Regularly conduct current affairs education, report the heroic deeds of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in defeating the enemy, and make all textile workers know that in order to protect the security of the motherland and the happy life of the people of the motherland, the Chinese People's Volunteers endure all hardships and bravely fight on the front line in Korea, and have won great victories. We in the rear should actively produce, give full play to the working class's spirit of "enduring hardship first and enjoying happiness later," and fully support them to eliminate the invading troops of American imperialism and its accomplices.

Deeply launching patriotic labor competition, producing more, and donating more are the most effective practical actions for our textile workers to resist America and aid Korea. The textile trade union should be familiar with the entire production situation and raw material situation, and formulate production and conservation plans according to the requirements of the state. The trade union should organize rationalization proposals, summarize mass creations, vigorously promote advanced experience, increase production, and practice strict economy. At present, raw cotton is still insufficient. In cotton textile factories, the trade union should vigorously promote the Hao Jianxiu work method. Hao Jianxiu is an outstanding worker cultivated after liberation. Because she has a high sense of responsibility of the working class, humbly learns, and is good at absorbing the advantages of others and abandoning her own shortcomings, she has created a set of scientific fine yarn work methods. The main characteristic of Hao Jianxiu's work method is to rationalize the work process, so as to save time and energy, save raw materials, reduce costs, extend the life of machines, and increase production. Hao Jianxiu's work method is the product of the struggle between progress and backwardness, and it is the concentrated expression of the advantages in the work of fine yarn workers. This is an innovation in Chinese textile production. If all the fine yarn workers in the country can reach the level of Hao Jianxiu, they can produce 44,460 more pieces of yarn a year. All employees of Qingdao State-owned Cotton No. 2 Factory have formulated a plan to learn Hao Jianxiu's work method, increase production, and practice strict economy. The increased production and savings in half a year can buy a fighter plane. If all the employees of cotton textile factories across the country are like Qingdao State-owned Cotton No. 2 Factory, learn Hao Jianxiu's work method, and formulate a plan to increase production and practice strict economy, then the increased production and savings of cotton textile factories across the country in a year can buy 150 to 200 fighter planes. All textile workers and trade union cadres should study Hao Jianxiu's work method well, incorporate the learning of Hao Jianxiu's work method and the plan to increase production and practice strict economy into the patriotic convention, make it a specific plan for patriotic competition, further launch patriotic competition, create more wealth for the country, and enhance the power to resist America and aid Korea.

The Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union has achieved great results and rich experience in summarizing and promoting Hao Jianxiu's work method. This is worthy of praise. The textile trade union organizations at all levels should learn from their experience and push our work forward.

In the patriotic competition movement, the trade union should organize the masses to assist the administration or capitalists in reforming the wage system, changing the labor organization, reducing the levels of management institutions, measuring quotas, implementing economic accounting, and reducing costs, so that our textile production can create more wealth for the country. This is the task of the administration or capitalists, and it is also the task of our trade union. This is our economic task, and it is also our political task.

In order to do a good job in production and enhance the power to resist America and aid Korea, it is necessary to gradually improve the necessary labor conditions and welfare facilities according to the continuous improvement of the production level. Do not forget that ensuring the health of workers and staff is of decisive significance for the development of production. Under the current circumstances, our lives cannot be fully improved, and we can only focus on effectively improving the labor conditions that endanger the health of workers and staff, and running welfare undertakings that are most urgently needed by the majority of the masses. Too high workshop temperature and poor safety devices pose the greatest threat to the health of workers and staff, and also have the greatest impact on production. These labor conditions must be effectively improved to reduce diseases and work-related injuries and deaths. Over the past year, state-owned factories in Northeast China, Tianjin, and Qingdao, as well as private factories in Tianjin, have attached importance to the health of workers and staff, installed ventilation equipment, reduced temperature and humidity, and increased safety devices, which has improved the production enthusiasm of workers and staff. In the past, the temperature and humidity of the cloth yard of Qingdao No. 1 Factory were too high (it once exceeded 100 degrees last year), which directly affected the production mood of workers and staff. The administration and the trade union spent a lot of effort to install ventilation equipment to reduce the temperature (from more than 100 degrees to about 90 degrees) and humidity (to 70 to 75 degrees). After the temperature and humidity were reduced, the masses of workers and staff were so happy that they shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" in the workshop. Diseases were reduced, the attendance rate was greatly increased, the substandard cloth rate was greatly reduced, and the output was increased. This shows that reducing temperature and humidity has a great impact on production. Installing ventilation equipment to reduce temperature and humidity costs a little money, but it does not cost much. As long as there is a correct design and the limited money is used appropriately, the temperature and humidity can be reduced. The idea that the factory building is not good and the equipment is not good, and that labor conditions cannot be improved without building another factory building and replacing new machines is wrong. As long as the administration or capitalists are truly concerned about the health of workers and staff and concerned about production, even if the factory building is simple and the equipment is not good, labor conditions can be improved under the existing conditions. Running spare-time sanatoriums and nutrition canteens costs less money and yields great results, and the masses of workers and staff are most satisfied. This is the most effective way to restore the health of workers and staff, and such welfare undertakings should be vigorously carried out. Yingkou Textile Factory has run welfare undertakings such as spare-time sanatoriums and nutrition canteens, which have restored the health of workers and staff with weak bodies, increased the attendance rate to more than 97 percent, increased production, and reduced medical expenses. According to the experience of Northeast China, running spare-time sanatoriums and nutrition canteens not only does not increase costs, but reduces costs. Qingdao runs spare-time sanatoriums, spending only a small amount of money to buy beds, washbasins, etc., and the houses are squeezed out of the original staff dormitories. The factory directors are willing to give up their own houses in order to run the sanatoriums. This is a manifestation of the factory directors' concern for the lives of the workers, which is worthy of praise. This fact shows that as long as the administration has a mass perspective, is truly concerned about the lives of the workers, and recognizes the country's economic situation, the difficulty of finding houses to run spare-time sanatoriums can be overcome. The idea of only focusing on profits and not caring about the health of workers and staff is foolish, it is really "losing both the lady and the army." In addition to the administration or capitalists effectively improving labor conditions, the trade union should vigorously organize mass forces to implement mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of the masses in their daily lives. The mutual assistance fund is the best organizational form for solving the difficulties of the masses by exerting the power of the masses. At the same time, the economic power of the trade union should be brought into play to help members in difficulty to solve their difficulties. Twenty percent of the subsidy must be used to subsidize members in difficulty, of which 50 percent must be used for infant food subsidies and cannot be used for other purposes. Today, we are resisting America and aiding Korea on the one hand and preparing for construction on the other hand. The country still has economic difficulties and the lives of the people have not been generally improved. Textile workers should not make excessive demands. Because our working class has become the leading class of the state power and the status of the working class has undergone fundamental changes, the government has vigorously stabilized prices and implemented the labor insurance regulations, and our lives are much better than in the past. Of course, our lives today are not completely satisfactory, and we must gradually improve our lives under the conditions of continuously improving production. All textile workers should highly give play to the working class's spirit of "enduring hardship first and enjoying happiness later," concentrate their efforts on building a strong national defense force, strive for the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, and create our happy living conditions. The final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea is the greatest welfare for the working class. The trade union should, on the one hand, effectively persuade the workers not to make and insist on excessive demands, and on the other hand, effectively care for the lives of workers and staff. At the same time, it should resolutely oppose the bureaucratic style of the administration or capitalists who violate labor laws and do not care for the lives of workers, and also oppose the bureaucratic style in the work of the trade union. It is necessary to stand firm on the working class's position and protect the interests of the working class. Only such a trade union can be supported by the masses of workers and staff and become a strong pillar of the people's government.

Combining current affairs education and patriotic competition to strengthen cultural education and strive to basically eliminate illiteracy in three to five years (now only two to four years) is a task that has been put forward long ago. Eliminating illiteracy and improving the cultural level of workers and staff are of great significance for improving technical level, management ability, and cultivating a large number of talents for national economic construction. We must seize all possible opportunities, use all possible manpower and material resources, and carry out organized and planned spare-time cultural education to strive to eliminate illiteracy among textile workers as soon as possible. Jinzhou Textile Factory has basically eliminated illiteracy, which is worthy of praise. The experience of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union in eliminating illiteracy is successful, and all localities should learn from their experience.

Strengthening the grassroots organizations of the textile trade union and strengthening the leadership of the textile trade union organizations at all levels are a powerful guarantee for completing the above tasks. It is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of members to thoroughly investigate and report counter-revolutionary elements, protect factories, and purify the trade union organizations. In the work of strengthening the grassroots organizations, special attention should be paid to strengthening group life, cultivating model workshops and model factories, and cultivating or promoting a large number of worker cadres and technical talents.

We are in the midst of a great struggle against the aggression of American imperialism and for the defense of the security of the motherland and world peace. The tasks of the textile trade union are arduous and the work is difficult. All cadres of the textile trade union should study hard, improve their political level, ideological level, and professional level, establish a democratic work style, do a good job in trade union work, and unite all textile workers under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to fight to complete the national production tasks, build a strong economic and national defense force, smash the aggression of American imperialism, strive for the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, and build an independent and prosperous New China!

    把抗美援朝运动与改进生产密切结合起来
    ——在八月二十一日中国纺织工会全国委员会首届第三次全体会议上的报告
    陈少敏
    抗美援朝保家卫国运动开展以后，中国工人阶级在“工厂就是战场，机器就是武器”的战斗口号下掀起了轰轰烈烈的爱国生产热潮。中国纺织工人在爱国生产运动中更进一步提出了自己的“一台布机一尊炮，一根锭子一杆枪”的具体口号。他们知道只有多生产、多捐献，建设强大的经济力量和国防力量，才能粉碎美帝国主义的侵略。获致抗美援朝的最后胜利，才能建设富强的新中国，才能改善全国人民和自己的生活。全国纺织工人以高度的爱国热情展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛。去冬某些地区即展开了捐献武器的运动。今年一月上海、青岛、天津纺织工人自动捐献工资购买飞机，这一运动在青岛曾经全面展开。随着爱国热潮的高涨，纺织系统中的劳动竞赛走上一个新的阶段。除各地工厂普遍展开小组竞赛外，东北、天津、青岛三地全体职工以及上海、西南部分职工还参加了地区之间的竞赛。几个月来，经过这一劳动竞赛，纺织系统的生产已经获得很大成绩。今年第一季全国国营棉纺织厂棉纱完成任务百分之一一零点零六，棉布完成任务百分之一零六点九六，其他毛、麻、丝织、针织、印染、机械、化工、梭管等厂都能按时完成任务，有许多厂月月超额完成任务。苏南有的缫丝厂缫丝品质创造了四A（缫丝质量有十余等级，过去习惯用ABC等英文字母表示，A是质量最好者。过去一般质量只达一两个A，今年一月无锡华昌丝厂质量达到四A，为全国最高纪录——新华社注）的新纪录。
    在劳动竞赛中职工群众发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。仅仅在第一季各地就提出合理化建议三二二八件，这对改进生产起了很大的作用。尤其是国营青岛棉纺织厂第六厂郝建秀工作法的创造，给改进纺织生产指出一个新的方向。中国纺织生产将因这一工作法的创造给国家生产更多的财富，节省更多的社会劳动力，因而也更增强了抗美援朝的力量。总之抗美援朝已成为生产运动的动力，职工群众已经把抗美援朝和生产密切地结合起来了。
    在抗美援朝保家卫国这一爱国运动中，纺织工会各级组织在共产党的领导下，做了许多工作，而且获得重大成绩。但是我们工会工作还做得不够，教育工作不够深入和广泛，还没有使每个工人职员从切身生活认识到抗美援朝的重要意义，还不善于把抗美援朝这一总任务与各种工作密切结合起来。某些工会干部把抗美援朝孤立起来搞，把抗美援朝与搞好生产当作两件事来做。某厂今年三月抗美援朝搞得轰轰烈烈，但没有和生产很好地结合，次布率始终在百分之三点三左右，在发现了这个缺点以后，又单纯强调反次布，全厂来了一个“大扫荡”，把抗美援朝的标语漫画等扫荡得一干二净。他们不是结合抗美援朝，使群众认识反次布的政治意义及与每个职工的切身关系，从而消灭次布，而是提出“厂长急得要哭，工程师急得挠头，大家快想办法消灭次布”。结果群众的政治认识水平没有提高，生产也不能在群众自觉的基础上稳步发展。以捐献飞机大炮来说，某些干部对增产捐献的意义认识不够明确，单纯地认为捐献就是“掏腰包”，未能领导工人具体地订出增产捐献计划，致使捐献与增产脱节。由于抗美援朝与生产结合不够，对增产捐献认识不明确，因而爱国公约缺乏具体内容。不仅不善于使抗美援朝和生产密切结合，而且与群众生活也没有具体结合起来。有些干部在领导生产中，对于改善劳动条件重视不够，未能根据今天的经济条件，发挥群众力量协助行政或资方改善劳动条件，因而影响工人健康。这种情形的发生，一方面由于工会对工人健康重视不够，另一方面是由于行政干部群众观点不强所致。他们不晓得适当改善劳动条件是搞好生产的重要因素。在使用困难会员补助费帮助会员解决生活困难这方面，青岛、天津、武汉等地工会组织做得比较好，得到了会员的拥护，密切了工会和会员的关系，这是我们工会关心工人生活的具体表现。但是有些地方却认为二次全国委员会决定的困难会员补助费太少，干脆把钱存在银行里去，有的则移作办公费或文化娱乐费。他们不知道从会费中拨出百分之二十，已经尽到我们纺织工会现有的最大力量，应该使这笔钱发挥它应有的作用。他们不知道职工生活的改善是要通过搞好生产，发挥各方面可能发挥的力量逐步达到，却幻想一下子即把生活改善得很好。我们有些干部还没有清楚地认识到在今天的情况下，发挥群众力量逐步改善工人生活是最实际的办法。群众已经认识到今天的困难，知道要集中一切力量来抗美援朝，对于生活方面的要求并不高，即使是部分的改善，群众都是满意的。但是有些干部却不会从实际出发满足群众的正当要求，因此我们工会便脱离了群众。总之，在抗美援朝运动中我们的工作还存在着缺点，这些缺点必须加以克服，才能使抗美援朝运动深入一步。
    抗美援朝运动已取得巨大胜利。十个月来朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军消灭了美国及其帮凶的侵略军二十余万，迫使美帝国主义接受苏联的建议举行停战谈判。但是美帝国主义并没有因遭受失败而改变其侵略政策。美帝国主义对和平谈判仍毫无诚意，同时公开表示要继续霸占我们的领土台湾，并且积极武装日本。祖国的安全仍受着严重的威胁。因此必须继续加强抗美援朝力量，粉碎美帝国主义侵略阴谋。应该知道，我们今天的胜利是经过艰苦斗争得来的。只有继续进行坚决的斗争，粉碎美帝国主义侵略，才能得到持久和平。继续加强抗美援朝运动，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利，是全国人民的头等政治任务，也是我们纺织工人的头等政治任务。我们必须继续动员全体纺织工人为完成这一任务而奋斗，必须使政治任务和经济任务密切结合，在抗美援朝运动中贡献纺织工人的全部力量。
    因此，我们必须更深入更广泛地进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育，进一步提高纺织工人的阶级觉悟和爱国热忱，使每个纺织工人都知道抗美援朝的重要意义，清楚认识中国人民力量的伟大。中国人民既然能推翻美蒋在中国的统治，建立自己的政权，就能取得抗美援朝的最后胜利，保卫革命胜利的果实，建设独立富强的新中国。经常进行时事教育，报告朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军英勇战胜敌人的事迹，使全体纺织工人知道中国人民志愿军为了保卫祖国的安全，为了祖国人民的幸福生活，忍受一切艰苦在朝鲜前线英勇作战，获得了伟大的胜利。我们在后方就应积极生产，发挥工人阶级“吃苦在先，享乐在后”的精神，全力支援他们，消灭美帝国主义及其帮凶的侵略军。
    深入展开爱国主义劳动竞赛，多生产，多捐献，就是我们纺织工人抗美援朝的最有效的实际行动。纺织工会应熟悉整个生产情况和原料情况，根据国家要求制订生产节约计划。工会应组织合理化建议，总结群众创造，大力推广先进经验，增加生产，厉行节约。目前原棉还不充足，在棉纺织厂中工会应大力推广郝建秀工作法。郝建秀是解放以后培养出来的优秀工人，由于她具有工人阶级高度的责任心，虚心学习，并善于吸取别人的优点，扬弃自己的缺点，创造了一套科学的细纱工作法。郝建秀工作方法的主要特点就是使工作过程合理化，以节省时间和精力，节约原料，降低成本，延长机器寿命，增加生产。郝建秀工作法是进步和落后斗争的产物，是细纱工人工作中优点的集中表现，这是中国纺织生产上的革新。假如全国细纱工人都能达到郝建秀的水平，一年可以多生产四四四六○件纱。青岛国棉二厂全体职工已制订学习郝建秀工作法、增加生产、厉行节约的计划，半年内增产节约所得可购买战斗机一架。假如全国棉纺织厂职工都像国营青岛棉纺织厂第二厂一样，学习郝建秀工作法，订出增产节约计划，那末一年工夫全国棉纺织厂增产节约所得即可购买一百五十至二百架战斗机。全体纺织工人和工会干部，都应好好学习郝建秀工作法，把学习郝建秀工作法、增产节约计划订到爱国公约中去，使之成为爱国竞赛的具体计划，进一步展开爱国竞赛，为国家创造更多的财富，增强抗美援朝力量。
    纺织工会青岛市委员会在总结与推广郝建秀工作法的工作中取得了重大成绩和丰富经验。这是值得表扬的。纺织工会各级组织应好好学习他们的经验，把我们的工作推进一步。
    在爱国竞赛运动中，工会应组织群众协助行政或资方改革工资制度，改变劳动组织，减少管理机构层次，测定定额，实施经济核算，减低成本，使我们纺织生产为国家创造更多的财富。这是行政或资方的任务，同时也是我们工会的任务，这是我们的经济任务，同时也是我们的政治任务。
    为了搞好生产，增强抗美援朝力量，必须有计划地根据生产水平的不断提高，逐步改善必要的劳动条件和福利设施。不要忘记保障职工身体健康，对于发展生产是有决定意义的。在目前情况下，我们的生活还不可能全部改善，只能有重点地切实改善危害职工健康的劳动条件，举办大多数群众最迫切需要的福利事业。车间温度过高，安全装置不良，对职工健康危害最大，对生产影响也最大。这些劳动条件必须切实加以改善，以减少疾病和因工伤亡。一年来东北、天津、青岛国营厂以及天津私营厂重视了职工身体健康，安装通风设备，降低温度、湿度，增加安全装置，提高了职工生产积极性。青岛一厂布场过去温度、湿度过高（去年曾超过一百度），直接影响职工生产情绪，行政和工会花了很大精力安装通风设备，降低了温度（从百余度降到了九十度左右）和湿度（已降到七十至七十五度）。温度、湿度降低后，职工群众高兴得在车间里喊“毛主席万岁”。疾病减少，出勤率大大提高，次布率大大降低，产量提高。这说明降低温度、湿度对生产的影响是很大的。安装通风设备降低温度、湿度是要花一点钱的，但是花钱并不很多，只要有正确的设计，使有限的钱用得恰当，是可以降低温度、湿度的。那种认为厂房不好，设备不好，非另盖厂房，换新机器，不能改善劳动条件的思想，是错误的。只要行政或资方真正关心职工健康，关心生产，即便厂房简陋，设备不好，也能在现有条件下改善劳动条件。举办业余疗养所和营养食堂，花钱少，收效大，职工群众最满意。这是恢复职工身体健康最有效的办法，这样的福利事业应大力举办。营口纺织厂举办了业余疗养所和营养食堂等福利事业，使身体弱的职工恢复了健康，出勤率提高到百分之九十七以上，生产增加，医药费则减少。根据东北的经验，举办业余疗养所和营养食堂，不仅没有增加成本，反而降低了成本。青岛举办业余疗养所，仅花少量的钱购买床铺、脸盆等，房子都是从原有职员宿舍中挤出来的。厂长们为了举办疗养所情愿让出自己所住的房子，这是厂长关心工人生活的表现，是值得表扬的。这一事实说明只要行政上有群众观点，真正关心工人生活，认识国家经济情况，举办业余疗养所的房子困难是可以克服的。那种只顾盈利不顾职工身体健康的思想是愚蠢的，真是“赔了夫人又折兵”。除行政或资方切实改善劳动条件外，工会应大力组织群众力量实行互助，解决群众日常生活上的困难。互助基金会就是发挥群众力量解决群众困难的最好的组织形式。同时应发挥工会的经济力量，帮助有困难的会员解决困难。百分之二十的补助费必须切实用以补助困难会员，其中百分之五十要用在婴儿食品补贴方面，不能移作他用。我们今天是一面抗美援朝一面准备建设，国家还有经济困难，人民生活还未普遍提高，纺织工人不应提出过高的要求。由于我们工人阶级成了国家政权的领导阶级，工人阶级的地位起了根本变化，政府大力稳定物价，实施劳动保险条例，我们的生活已比过去好多了。当然我们今天的生活还不能令人完全满意，我们还要在不断提高生产的条件下逐步改善我们的生活。全体纺织工人应该高度发挥工人阶级“吃苦在先，享乐在后”的精神，集中力量建设强大的国防力量，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利，创造我们美满的生活条件。抗美援朝的最后胜利，是工人阶级的最大福利。工会应一方面切实说服工人不要提出和坚持过高要求，一方面要切实关心职工生活，同时要坚决反对行政或资方违反劳动法令，不关心工人生活的官僚主义，也反对工会工作中的官僚主义，要站稳工人阶级立场，保护工人阶级利益。这样的工会才能为职工群众所拥护，才能成为人民政府的有力支柱。
    结合时事教育、爱国竞赛，加强文化教育，争取在三年至五年（现在只有两年至四年）内基本上消灭文盲，这是早已提出的任务。消灭文盲，提高职工文化水平，对于提高技术水平，管理能力，大量培养国家经济建设人材具有重要意义。我们必须争取一切可能的机会，利用一切可能的人力、物力，有组织有计划地开展业余文化教育，争取早日消灭纺织工人中的文盲。金州纺织厂已基本上消灭了文盲，这是值得表扬的。纺织工会旅大市委员会消灭文盲的经验是成功的，各地应好好学习他们的经验。
    健全纺织工会基层组织，加强纺织工会各级组织的领导，是完成上述任务的有力保证。必须发动广大会员群众切实清查，检举反革命分子，保卫工厂，纯洁工会组织。在健全基层组织这一工作中，应特别注意健全小组生活，培养模范车间、模范厂，大量培养或提拔工人干部、技术人材。
    我们正处在反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国安全和世界和平的伟大斗争中，纺织工会的任务是繁重的，工作是艰苦的。纺织工会全体干部应该努力学习，提高政治水平、思想水平和业务水平，树立民主作风，做好工会工作，团结全体纺织工人在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，为完成国家生产任务，建设强大的经济力量和国防力量，粉碎美帝国主义侵略，争取抗美援朝最后胜利，建设独立富强的新中国而奋斗！
