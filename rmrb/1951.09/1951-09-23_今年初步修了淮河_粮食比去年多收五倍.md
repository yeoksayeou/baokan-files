    Preliminary Repair of the Huai River This Year: Grain Harvest Increased Fivefold Compared to Last Year

    Editor:
    I am the township head of Daqiao Township, Weishi County, Henan Province. Our Daqiao Township is surrounded by low-lying land on three sides and highland on two sides, facing the Kanggou River to the east. Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang blew up the Huayuankou Yellow River levee, the originally silted river channels have become even more difficult for water to flow through, resulting in years of flooding. I remember that in thirteen years, we only harvested two wheat seasons and two autumn harvests. Out of the 300 households in the entire village, 100 households fled as refugees with their entire families, and 50 households had some members flee. Among those who stayed in their hometowns, eight out of ten families had little to eat and borrowed a lot of debt, making life very difficult. After liberation, the People's Government led us in production for self-relief. From last year to this year, our township has been loaned 41,000 catties of grain, and those who fled as refugees have slowly returned. Last year, Chairman Mao called for harnessing the Huai River. This spring, the river here was dredged, and we overcame the difficulties. The wheat harvest this year was good, yielding five dou per mu (25 catties per dou), and even the worst yielded two dou. Our lives are much better than before. My family has seven people and 22 mu of land. Last year, we harvested a total of 650 catties of grain. After harnessing the Huai River this year, we can harvest 3,800 catties, a fivefold increase compared to last year. I think, today we have the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who led us to dredge the river channels, saving our fields from flooding and saving our lives. In the future, I must work hard and respond to Chairman Mao's call: "We must repair the Huai River well."

### 今年初步修了淮河  粮食比去年多收五倍

    今年初步修了淮河
    粮食比去年多收五倍编辑同志：
    我是河南省尉氏县大桥乡的乡长。俺大桥乡三面是凹地，两边是岗地，东面临康沟河。自从蒋介石匪帮炸开花园口黄河大堤，使原来淤塞的河道水更不能下行，所以连年遭到水患。我记得十三年中，只收了两季麦，两季秋。全村三百户人家，全家逃荒出去的即有一百户，逃出去一部分的也有五十户。留在家乡的十家有八家没啥吃，都借了很多债，生活非常痛苦。解放后，人民政府领导我们生产自救，从去年到今年，贷给俺乡四万一千斤粮，逃荒出去的人慢慢都回来了。去年毛主席号召治淮，今年春天俺这里的河挖通了，我们才度过了难关。今年麦季收的不错，每亩可以收到五斗（每斗二十五斤），最差的也能收二斗。我们的生活就比以前好的太多了。我家七口人，二十二亩地，去年一共收了六百五十斤粮食，今年治淮以后，可以收三千八百斤，比去年增加了五倍。我想，今天有了共产党、毛主席，领导俺们挖通河道，使俺们的田地不再受淹，就是把俺们的命救出来了。我今后一定要好好工作，响应毛主席的号召：“一定要把淮河修好”。
