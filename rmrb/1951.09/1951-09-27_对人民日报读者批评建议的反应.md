The Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Shaoyang Prefectural Committee
Handling the Illegal Activities of Cadres at the Xinhua Black Tea Factory

Editor,

The "Readers' Letters" page of the People's Daily on August 29th published a letter from the Xinhua County Twelfth District People's Government criticizing the poor work style and illegal behavior of certain cadres at the Hunan Xinhua Black Tea Factory, along with our investigation and response to this matter. The editor, in an editor's note, criticized our response. After studying it, we agree with those opinions.

Certain staff members of the Xinhua Black Tea Factory forcibly borrowed and rented surplus houses and associated furniture confiscated from landlords by the Yangmuzhou Township Farmers' Association and oppressed the masses, effectively protecting the landlords. However, we did not seriously criticize or diligently handle these cadres' poor work style and illegal behavior, but instead considered the issue to be a "dispute" between the Yangmuzhou Farmers' Association and the Xinhua Black Tea Factory. Clearly, our understanding of this matter was incorrect, and this objectively condoned certain elements violating laws and regulations. We should conduct a deep self-criticism on this.

We are now informing you of our handling decisions for this case:

(1) The Xinhua Black Tea Factory did not adopt a proactive and assisting attitude towards the farmers' righteous actions in demanding the struggle against the local tyrant landlord Chen He'ang, but instead perfunctorily dealt with the masses, which in effect protected the local tyrant landlord. Comrade Ma Shoushan, Secretary of the CPC Xinhua County Twelfth District Committee, fearing it would affect the tea factory's business, agreed not to hand over the local tyrant landlord Chen He'ang to the farmers for handling, which was also without principle. Therefore, the Xinhua Black Tea Factory and Comrade Ma Shoushan should both conduct self-criticism on this. Chen He'ang is currently still working at the Changsha Black Tea Factory as the head of the business section. We suggest that the Hunan Provincial Tea Company dismiss him and hand him over to the government of his original domicile for handling.

(2) Lian Guanwu, a staff member of the Xinhua Black Tea Factory, treated the mother of military dependent Liu Chunshan with a poor attitude, implying to the on-duty security personnel to drag her out. This barbaric and unreasonable behavior is completely wrong. Therefore, Lian Guanwu should conduct a self-criticism on this and apologize to Liu Chunshan's mother. We suggest that the factory administration give him a demerit.

(3) Zhou Jingmin, Deputy Director of the Xinhua Black Tea Factory, discovered that someone was stealing landlord's farm tools that had been confiscated by farmers, but did not report it to the Farmers' Association. In July 1950, without the permission of the Farmers' Association, he privately removed the seals from the confiscated landlord's house and moved his family to live there, occupying the furniture in the house. Wang Kun, the factory director, at the end of March of this year, without the permission of the Farmers' Association, took advantage of the township cadres attending a meeting at the district government to instigate Wang Zhenqiu, the person in charge of the general affairs section, to privately remove the seals of the Farmers' Association and occupy the houses confiscated by the Farmers' Association. In addition to returning all the seized gains to the masses within a time limit and apologizing to the masses, we also suggest that the factory's higher-level leading authorities impose administrative disciplinary actions on Zhou Jingmin and Wang Kun.

Inspection of Errors in the Reprinting of Customs Law by the South China Materials Exchange Guidance Committee

Editor,

The letter from the Press Secretary's Office of the General Administration of Customs published in the People's Daily on August 16th, stating that "the South China Materials Exchange Guidance Committee should not arbitrarily abridge national laws and regulations," is a correct criticism. The situation and handling process are reported as follows:

In June, the South China Materials Exchange Guidance Committee, because the Central South Native Products Exchange Conference was about to be held, printed the book "Introduction to Guangdong Native Products and Specialty Products" for the purpose of publicizing and promoting Guangdong native products and specialty products. In order to make private merchants understand the laws and regulations and facilitate the promotion of native products and specialty products, the "Customs Law of the People's Republic of China" was attached to the end of the book. At that time, the editor who compiled and printed the book was careless in his work and published a section of the Customs Law excerpted by a comrade, and the comrades who reviewed it did not carefully proofread it due to the rush of publication. This bad phenomenon of abridging national laws and regulations is very harmful. After we discovered it, we have notified the South China Materials Exchange Guidance Committee to delete the section on the "Customs Law of the People's Republic of China" in the existing books, and sent letters to various places to notify the cancellation of this section, and ordered the editor to conduct a deep self-criticism.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    中共邵阳地委纪律检查委员会
    处理新化红茶厂干部违法事件编辑同志：
    八月二十九日人民日报“读者来信专页”，发表了新化县第十二区人民政府批评湖南新化红茶厂某些干部的恶劣作风及不法行为的来信，和我们对这一事件的调查和答复。编者在按语中，批判了我们的答复。经过研究，我们同意那些意见。
    新化红茶厂某些职员，强借、强租杨木洲乡农会没收地主的多余房屋和随房家具，并欺压群众，实际上起了包庇地主的作用。但我们对这些干部的恶劣作风与犯法行为，没有进行严肃批判和认真处理，反而认为杨木洲农会与新化红茶厂是“闹纠纷”。显然，我们对这个问题的认识，是错误的，这在客观上是纵容了某些违法乱纪的分子。我们对此应作深刻检讨。
    现在将我们对这一案件的处理决定告诉你们：
    （一）新化红茶厂对农民要求斗争恶霸地主陈鹤昂的正义行动，没有采取积极协助的态度，而是敷衍搪塞群众，这实际上是包庇了恶霸地主。中共新化县第十二区委员会书记马寿山同志，怕影响茶厂业务，同意不将恶霸地主陈鹤昂交给农民处理，也是毫无原则的。因此，新化红茶厂与马寿山同志对此都应进行检讨。陈鹤昂现在仍在长沙红茶厂工作，任业务股长，我们建议湖南省茶叶公司把他开除，并交由其原籍政府处理。
    （二）新化红茶厂职员练冠吾，以恶劣态度对待军属刘春山的母亲，暗示值班警卫人员将她拖出去，这种野蛮无理的行为是完全错误的。因此，练冠吾应对此进行检讨，并应向刘春山的母亲道歉。我们建议该厂行政上给以记过处分。
    （三）新化红茶厂副厂长周靖民发现有人偷窃已被农民没收的地主农具等物，但不向农会报告；一九五○年七月间，他又不经农会允许，私自启去被没收的地主房屋的封条，将眷属搬进去居住，并占用该房家具。该厂厂长王堃于今年三月底不经农会允许，趁乡干部在区政府开会时，主使事务股负责人王振球，私自启去农会封条，占用农会没收的房屋。周靖民、王堃两人，除了应将所侵占的果实限期如数退还群众及向群众道歉外，我们并建议该厂上级领导机关予以行政纪律处分。

    关于华南物资交流指导委员会
    翻印海关法发生错误的检查编辑同志：
    人民日报八月十六日发表海关总署新闻秘书室关于“华南物资交流指导委员会不应任意把国家法令删节”一信，这种批评是很对的。兹将事情发生情况及处理经过报告如后：
    六月间，华南物资交流指导委员会因中南土产交流会议即将召开，为宣传和推销广东土产和特产起见，编印了“广东土特产介绍”一书，并为使私商明了法令，便于推销土产、特产品，将“中华人民共和国海关法”附在书后。当时编印该书的编辑人，工作上粗枝大叶，竟将一位同志节录下来的海关法登载，而审核的同志也因出版仓卒，没有细心校阅。这种删节国家法令的恶劣现象，是非常有害的。我们发现后，已通知华南物资交流指导委员会，将现有存书内“中华人民共和国海关法”一节删去，并去函各地通知取销此一篇幅，并着令编辑人作深刻检讨。
