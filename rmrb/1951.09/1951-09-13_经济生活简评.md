Economic Life Brief Comments

    Blind groping will not lead to good materials supply work
    Some cadres in the materials departments of the Tianjin Railway Administration do not investigate the actual situation and do materials supply work behind closed doors, which wastes a lot of materials. In October of last year, the Tianjin Vehicle Factory of the bureau submitted more than two hundred wheels to the materials section of the bureau, saying: These wheels have pinholes and cannot be used. The materials section sealed up all the wheels it received, preparing to transfer them to the Ministry of Railways. In August of this year, when the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways came to the bureau to investigate materials work, they found that many of the wheels that had been sealed for ten months could be used. In these ten months, some factories of the bureau were shut down because they did not have wheels, and the materials section of the bureau was busy purchasing wheels everywhere, but did not check whether the sealed materials could be used. How much loss has this bureaucratic work style of not investigating and researching caused the country!
    Some cadres engaged in materials work in the bureau said: "What we do is just supply work." They have a "serving others" mentality, so they lose their enthusiasm and initiative for work. When supplying materials, they do not check the quality of the materials, but simply "supply" them after they pass through their hands; in this way, some materials become "dead stock" (stock in the warehouse, unusable) because they do not meet the specifications. Some cadres engaged in materials work also believe: "Using materials is the business of the production department." They regard their work as isolated, so they do not consult with the production department when buying materials. As a result, many of the materials purchased are stockpiled because they are not suitable. Doing work in this way is actually worse than not doing work at all. We should constantly remind staff with this kind of thinking and style: it is no longer acceptable to use the "old rules" of the enemy and puppet bureaucratic institutions to do the work of the people's enterprises! We have become the masters of the country, and we must act like masters when doing things. It is certainly easier for us to do materials work behind closed doors, but for the entire people's enterprise, it will cost much more!

    瞎摸是做不好材料供应工作的
    天津铁路管理局有些材料部门的干部不调查实际情况，关门做材料供应工作，这样就把许多材料浪费了。去年十月该局天津车辆工厂把所存的二百多个车轮上缴给该局材料处，对材料处说：这批车轮有砂眼，不能用。材料处接到这批车轮就通统封存起来，预备转移给铁道部。今年八月，铁道部材料局到该局调查材料工作时，发现这批封存了十个月的车轮中有很多是可以使用的。在这十个月中，该局有些工厂因为没有车轮而停工，该局材料处到处奔忙，购置车轮，却没有看看这批被封存的材料到底能不能用。这种不调查研究的官僚主义作风，使国家遭受了多大损失！
    该局有些做材料工作的干部说：“我们干的就只是供应工作。”他们存在着一种“伺候别人”的思想，所以就丧失了工作的积极性和主动性，供应材料时不检查材料的质量，只是经一下手，“供应”出去就算完事；这样，有些材料因为不合规格，就成了“呆料”（呆在库里，无处可用的料）。还有一些做材料工作的干部认为：“用材料是生产部门的事情。”他们把自己的工作看成是孤立的，所以买材料时也不和生产部门商量。结果，买来的材料有许多因为不适用而积压起来。这样做工作，实际上简直比不做工作还要糟糕。应该不断地提醒有这种思想作风的工作人员：现在还要拿过去给敌伪官僚机构办事的“老规矩”来做人民企业的工作，是不行了！我们做了国家的主人翁，就得拿出主人翁的态度做事。关着门做材料工作对自己说固然很省事，可是，对整个人民企业来说，可就不知要多费多少事了！
