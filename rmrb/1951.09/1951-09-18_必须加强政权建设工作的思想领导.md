Must Strengthen Ideological Leadership in Political Power Construction
Wang Guozhen, Commissioner of Baoding Special District, Hebei

    In the past year or so, the people's representative conferences of each county in Baoding Special District, with the exception of Gaoyang and Anxin counties, have generally convened six to eight times. Some were well-held, but in most cases, the connection between the county people's government and the people's representatives, and between the people's representatives and the broad masses, was not close enough after the meetings. A representative from Gu'an County criticized these meetings as "blown away by the wind," happening only sporadically. In the democratic political power construction process of the past two years, there has been a basic situation: when the leadership from top to bottom emphasizes and urges closely, the people's representative conferences can be convened on time; this spring and summer, due to poor supervision and inspection, some counties did not pay attention; since July, in preparation for the North China County Head Conference, the Special Commissioner's Office and county leading organs studied documents on democratic political power construction, and combined this with inspection and summarized the work of political power construction. The Special Commissioner's Office and the counties have again begun to pay attention to this work. In July and August, the counties mostly held a people's representative conference; Gaoyang and Anxin decided to convene people's representative conferences in early September. This situation proves that the realization of a people's democratic system for the broad masses not only requires a sound organizational form and system but also requires the leading organs to regularly value and strengthen ideological leadership.

    The Special Commissioner's Office sent cadres to participate in the people's representative conferences of Mancheng, Qingyuan, and Xushui counties, and sent cadres to thirteen villages in Rongcheng, Xushui, Mancheng, Qingyuan, and other counties to visit resident county representatives and conduct inspections among the masses. They found that one of the important reasons why the people's representative conferences at the county, district, and village levels are still not sound is that cadres and representatives still have deviations in their understanding of the people's representative conferences. This is mainly manifested in:

    The leading organs of the Special Commissioner's Office and the counties do not have a deep understanding of the people's representative conferences as an indispensable national system. Some leading cadres in the counties believe that holding people's representative conferences is "circuitous and too slow," and not as direct as holding cadre meetings, and thus relaxed their leadership over the people's representative conferences, or regarded convening people's representative conferences as a shock task, and rarely took the initiative to regularly and systematically inspect and summarize this work; some counties had not convened a people's representative conference in eight months. These phenomena show that they have not yet realized that only by gradually improving the people's representative conferences and raising the democratic awareness of the broad masses can the construction of the country be fully guaranteed.

    Some departments and cadres believe that holding good people's representative conferences is a matter for the "government heads and civil affairs departments" and has little to do with themselves, and they are indifferent to this basic national system. They neither combine their department's work to study how to exert the power of the people's representative conferences nor actively publicize and reflect the situation of the people's representative conferences. Some departments cannot relate to reality when studying documents on the construction of people's democratic political power, which fully exposes their lack of concern for political power construction on weekdays, and they do not regard the realization of this basic national system as everyone's responsibility, especially the responsibility of cadres.

    The "left-leaning closed-door thought" is relatively serious among some village-level cadres. Some village cadres consider themselves meritorious and look down on the representatives elected by the people, believing that the people's representative conferences are "a formality, a show." After the county representative from Dongbailu Village, Xushui County, returned to the village and talked about the situation of the people's representative conference, it aroused the resentment of some cadres in the village: "Forget it, don't give us a political lesson, we know everything!" A county representative from Xiaojinying was dismissed by the village cadres because of a disagreement with the village cadres. A cadre from Yulinzhuang Village, Yi County, heard that the people's representative conference had power and authority, so he chased back the representative elected by the masses and went to the meeting himself. These phenomena show that some cadres have a wrong understanding of the people's representatives and the people's representative conferences. For these cadres, repeated and patient education must be carried out to enable them to correctly recognize and respect the democratic rights of the people, establish a mass viewpoint, and organize and unite the broad masses ideologically and politically to do a good job.

    The elected people's representatives come from all walks of life, and their political level and ideological situation are also different. Although some representatives have already spoken their minds and done a good job, most of the people's representatives have ideological concerns, encounter difficulties in their work, and need help to solve them. Some representatives have not paid attention to or lack ways to establish close ties with the broad masses. Some masses, after being elected as representatives, have few ways to work and completely push the work to the village cadres. For example, Lei Yongping, a county representative from Xinzhuang, Rongcheng, handed the draft and documents he brought back from the people's representative conference to the village cadres and ignored them. Some representatives felt that they were useless and did not carry out any activities after the meeting. In addition, a large number of representatives have a unclear understanding of their work duties and powers, and they also regard themselves as village cadres. A worker representative from Beiguan Village, Rongcheng County, does all kinds of work, weighing grain when collecting public grain, and running errands when calling people to meetings. A 64-year-old female representative from Wujitai Village, Xushui County, is very active in her work and takes care of everything. The masses said, "Big and small things must be found with the old representative, and they cannot be solved without finding her." These representatives are indeed very enthusiastic and have done a lot of specific administrative work; however, they have paid little attention to how to exert organizational power. Most representatives are not clear about what kind of working relationship they should establish with county, district, and village organs and cadres, and what working methods should be adopted, and they request help to solve this.

    Because the leading organs, cadres, and people's representatives still have many deviations in their understanding of political power construction work, because the people's representative conference work itself still has many shortcomings, and because some masses still have a vague understanding of the nature of the people's representative conference, in the future, on the one hand, we should pay attention to the people's representative conference from top to bottom and constantly supervise and inspect it; at the same time, we must also pay attention to strengthening democratic education for the broad masses in the patriotic movement.

    How to strengthen ideological leadership in political power construction work? According to the experience of the past and recent two months, it must be:

    (1) The leading organs of the Special Commissioner's Office and the counties must attach importance to studying the important documents on the construction of people's democratic political power and study the specific experiences introduced in the newspapers. Only when the leading organs and cadres attach importance to it and the ideological level is improved can they summarize and analyze the situation and discover problems, and seek solutions.

    (2) When convening a people's representative conference, one day or half a day should be used to specifically report and discuss how to understand the people's representative conference and how to hold a good people's representative conference? Qingyuan County, under the direct leadership of the Provincial People's Government, convened a forum with 36 people's representatives participating and spent three days specifically discussing how to hold a good people's representative conference. Xushui County used one day to report and discuss the understanding of cadres and representatives on the people's representative conference at the people's representative conference convened in August. The advantage of doing this is that it can summarize the ideological situation of leading cadres, general cadres, and representatives at each stage, and exchange work experience to arouse the attention of leading organs and cadres and improve the ideological level of cadres and representatives. For example, Xushui County had not registered the names of representatives attending the meeting in the past. Because the meeting convened in August studied the representative meeting, it attached importance to this work. The county leading cadres also held separate forums with sixty absent representatives to convey the resolutions of the people's representative conference. This made the absent representatives understand their responsibilities and increased their political enthusiasm.

    (3) The leading organs of the Special Commissioner's Office and the counties should regularly and purposefully send cadres to go deep into the rural areas to conduct key visits and hold small forums to understand the thinking and work of the people's representatives, understand the understanding of cadres and the masses on the people's representative conference, understand the relationship between cadres and representatives, and study them in order to draw lessons and improve work. In August, the Special Commissioner's Office coordinated with county and district cadres from Rongcheng, Xushui, and other counties to do this. It was found that most representatives complained that the leading organs did not contact them enough and that they did not know how to work. At the same time, it was also found that some representatives worked very well. For example, the county representative from Zhangwang Village convened a village people's representative conference after returning to the village to convey the resolutions and put forward specific guarantees for the realization of the resolutions. The village cadres said that with the help of the county representative, our work has been better promoted. It is also a very important leadership method to introduce the correct working methods of these representatives to other representatives and improve their ideological understanding.

    必须加强政权建设工作的思想领导
    河北保定专区专员  王国珍
    一年多来，保定专区各县人民代表会议，除高阳、安新二县外，一般都召开过六次到八次会议。有些开得很好；但大多数是会后县人民政府与人民代表之间、人民代表与广大群众之间的联系很不密切。固安县一位代表就曾批评过这种会议是“风吹云散”，一阵一阵的。在近二年来的民主政权建设过程中，有一个基本情况，即当自上而下重视并督促得紧的时候，人民代表会议就能按时召开；今年春夏因督促检查得差，有些县就不注意了；从七月以来为准备华北县长会议，专署、县领导机关学习了民主政权建设文件，结合着检查，总结了政权建设工作，专署和各县又重视起这一工作来了。七、八月份各县大都开了一次人民代表会议；高阳、安新决定在九月上旬召开人民代表会议。这种情况证明，实现一个广大人民的人民民主制度，不但需要有一套健全的组织形式和制度，还必须领导机关经常重视并加强思想领导。
    专署曾派干部参加了满城、清苑、徐水三县的人民代表会议，派干部到容城、徐水、满城、清苑等县的十三个村，对驻村县代表进行了访问和在群众中进行了检查，发现县、区、村三级人民代表会议之所以还不健全的重要原因之一，是干部、代表对于人民代表会议的认识还有偏差。主要表现在：
    专署、县领导机关对于人民代表会议是不可缺少的国家制度认识不深刻。有些县的领导干部认为开人民代表会“绕湾，太慢”，不如开干部会直接了当，而放松了对人民代表会议的领导，或把召开人民代表会议当成一个突击任务，并且很少主动地经常地系统地检查总结这一工作；有的县八个月没开过一次人民代表会议。这些现象，都说明了他们还没认识到只有逐步健全了人民代表会议，提高了广大人民的民主觉悟，才能使国家建设取得充分的保证。
    有的部门和干部认为开好人民代表会议是“政府首长和民政部门”的事，与自己关系不大，对这国家的基本制度漠不关心。他们既不结合本部门的工作研究如何发挥人民代表会议的力量，也不主动地宣传和反映人民代表会议的情况。有的部门在学习人民民主政权建设文件时不能联系实际，这充分暴露了他们平日不关心政权建设的情况，并没把实现这一国家的基本制度看成是人人有责，特别是干部的责任。
    部分村级干部中“左倾关门思想”比较严重。有些村干部以功臣自居，看不起人民选出来的代表，认为人民代表会议是“闹形式，摆样子”。徐水县东白露村县代表回去与村干部讲了讲人民代表会议的情况，惹起了该村某些干部的反感：“算了，你别给我们上政治课了，我们都知道！”肖金营一位县代表因与村干部闹了点意见，便被村干部撤了职。易县榆林庄村一个干部听说人民代表会议有职有权，便把群众选出的代表追回来，自己去参加会议。这些现象都说明了某些干部对于人民代表和人民代表会议持有错误的认识。对于这些干部，必须反复地耐心地进行教育，使他们正确地认识并尊重人民民主权利，树立起群众观点，把广大人民从思想上、政治上组织起来，团结起来，把工作作好。
    当选的人民代表来自各个阶层，其政治水平和思想情况也不一样。虽然有些代表已作到知无不言，工作也作得很好，但是，大部分的人民代表有思想顾虑，工作中遇到困难，需要帮助他们解决。有些代表还没注意或缺少办法与广大群众取得密切的联系。有的群众当选代表后，工作很少办法，便把工作完全推给了村干部。如容城新庄县代表雷永平开完人民代表会议后，把带回的草案与文件向本村干部一交就不管了。有些代表觉着自己不顶事，会后也没进行什么活动。另有大批代表对工作职权认识不清，把自己也当成了村干部。容城县北关村一位工人代表什么工作也干，收公粮时提秤，开会时跑腿叫人。徐水县武吉台村一位妇女代表，六十四岁了，工作很积极，什么事也管。群众说：“事大事小得找老代表，不找到她解决不了。”这些代表确是非常热情，作了很多具体的行政工作；但是对于怎样发挥组织力量就注意得很差。多数代表对于自己应与县、区、村机关干部建立什么工作关系，应当采用什么工作方式，还不太清楚，要求帮助解决。
    由于领导机关、干部、人民代表对于政权建设工作的认识还有不少偏差，由于人民代表会议工作本身还存有不少缺点，由于有些群众对于人民代表会议的性质认识得还很模糊，所以今后一方面应自上而下地重视人民代表会议，并不断进行督促和检查，同时，还必须注意在爱国主义运动中加强对广大群众的民主教育。
    怎样加强政权建设工作的思想领导呢？根据过去和最近两个月的经验来看，必须是：
    （一）专署、县的领导机关必须重视学习人民民主政权建设的重要文件，和研究报纸上所介绍的具体经验。领导机关和干部重视了，思想水平提高了才能总结分析情况和发现问题，求得解决办法。
    （二）召开人民代表会议时，应用一天或半天的时间，专门报告和讨论怎样认识人民代表会议，怎样开好人民代表会议？清苑县在省人民政府直接领导下，曾召开了有三十六位人民代表参加的座谈会，用三天时间专门讨论了怎样开好人民代表会议的问题。徐水县在八月份召开的人民代表会议，用一天时间报告和讨论了干部和代表对人民代表会议的认识。这样作的好处，是能把每一阶段中领导干部、一般干部以及代表的思想情况总结一下，交换工作经验，以引起领导机关和干部的重视，提高干部和代表的思想水平。如徐水县过去没有登记过出席会议的代表名单，八月份召开的会议因为研究了代表会议，便重视了这一工作。县领导干部还分头对六十位缺席代表召开了片的座谈会，传达了人民代表会议的决议。这样就使缺席的代表明白了自己的职责，提高了政治热情。
    （三）专署、县的领导机关应经常有计划、有目的地派出干部深入农村进行重点访问和召开小型座谈会，了解人民代表的思想和工作情况，了解干部与群众对人民代表会议的认识，了解干部与代表的关系，并加以研究，以便吸取经验，改进工作。八月间专署协同容城、徐水等县的县、区干部这样作了一下，发现多数代表埋怨领导机关与他们联系不够，自己不知道如何工作。同时也发现了有的代表工作得很好，如张旺村县代表回村后先开村人民代表会议，传达决议，并提出实现决议的具体保证。村干部说，有了县代表的帮助，我们的工作更好推动了。我们应将这些代表的正确工作方法介绍给其他代表，提高他们的思想认识，也是很重要的领导方法。
