Brief Commentary on Cultural Life

    Zhang Hai, Director of the Theoretical Education Department of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, introduced the basic situation and teaching experience of the Wuhan Municipal机关 Marxism-Leninism Night School over the past four months in the Yangtze Daily on September 1st. From this introduction, we can see that the Marxism-Leninism Night School is one of the good ways to systematically train theoretical teachers for government organizations; and to run such a night school well, teachers are a prerequisite. Although the Central China Lecturers Group has initially solved this problem, there are still many problems because all lecturers are part-time. However, as Comrade Zhang Hai said: "Because it is a school of the Party, relying on the leadership of the Party, relying on the consciousness of the broad masses of party members and cadres, and relying on the encouragement and guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought," everyone not only started the night school but also persisted in it. In fact, the school currently has 543 formal students and 405 auditors. They are all on-the-job party member cadres selected by various units, more than half of whom are section-level cadres. After more than four months of study, the students generally believe that they have improved in terms of policy thinking and theory. For example, some comrades said: In the past, studying theory was "sitting uncomfortably, reading hurt their eyes, and thinking gave them headaches," and they didn't get any benefits as a result; now, they "sit steadily, read more, and think further." These facts prove that the Marxism-Leninism Night School should be established, can be established, and can be persisted in.

    应当有计划地培养领导理论学习的骨干
    中共中央中南局理论教育处处长张海同志，在九月一日的长江日报上，介绍了武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜间学校四个月来的基本情况及教学经验。我们从这一介绍中看出：马克思列宁主义夜校是有计划地培养机关理论教员的良好方式之一；而要办好这样的夜校，教师又是一个先决条件。中南讲师团虽然已经初步解决了这个问题，但由于所有讲师都是兼职的，因而问题还是不少。不过正如张海同志所说的：“因为它是党的学校，凭借着党的领导，凭借着广大党员干部的自觉，凭借着马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的鼓舞和引导”，大家就不但把夜校办起来了，而且坚持下来了。事实上，目前该校共有正式学员五四三人，旁听生四○五人。他们都是各单位选派来的在职党员干部，其中半数以上是科长级的干部。经过四个多月的学习，学员们普遍认为自己在政策思想上和理论上都提高了一步。譬如有些同志说：从前学习理论是“坐得腰痛、看得眼痛、想得头痛”，结果还得不到什么好处；现在则是“坐得稳、看得多、想得远”了。这些事实证明，马克思列宁主义夜校是应该办、可以办而且是能够坚持下去的。
