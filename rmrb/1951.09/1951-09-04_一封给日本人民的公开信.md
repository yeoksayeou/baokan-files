An Open Letter to the Japanese People
Guo Moruo

Japanese workers, farmers, students, progressive intellectuals, and all other patriotic friends:

I am writing this open letter to you as an old friend who received higher education in Japan and lived there for a full twenty years. I believe your country is again at a most dangerous juncture. You, who are truly thinking of the country, should more actively rise up, unite, organize, and do your best to save it.

The "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan," unilaterally drafted by the United States and its servant Britain, has been announced and is preparing to be signed at a meeting in San Francisco on September 4th. Your Yoshida government is showing an attitude of being flattered by this favor and has decided to participate and accept this one-sided treaty. This is what I feel: your country is again at a most dangerous juncture.

The "Draft Peace Treaty" is fundamentally illegal. It thoroughly violates all international agreements, violates the interests of the people of the world, and especially adopts an absolutely hostile attitude towards us, the Chinese people. It obliterates all our efforts during the eight years of the War of Resistance, denies our legitimate right to jointly draft the treaty, and fundamentally rejects our right to sign the treaty. This arrogant and arbitrary imperialist attitude is absolutely intolerable to us, the Chinese people. On August 15th, our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai already issued a solemn statement: "The preparation, drafting, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan, without the participation of the People's Republic of China, will be considered illegal and therefore invalid by the Central People's Government, regardless of its content and outcome." This precisely represents the righteous voice of all the Chinese people, and just people all over the world are warmly responding.

But we can understand why the American ruling class is eager to sign such an illegal, one-sided peace treaty with Japan and why it is particularly hostile to our People's Republic of China. After the end of World War II, the Axis countries that fought for colonies were defeated, and capitalist countries with large colonies such as Britain and France were also weakened in the war, thus triggering the ambition of American imperialists to dominate the world. In order to satisfy this ambition, the American imperialists have performed countless crazy tragicomedies in the past six years. But their madness has suffered the heaviest blow in front of the Chinese people. First of all, it was the success of the Chinese people's revolution. We completely wiped out the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was heavily supported by the United States, from the mainland, and completely expelled the American aggression forces that had been in place for more than a hundred years. Last June, the United States launched a war of aggression against Korea and endangered the security of our motherland. The Chinese people could not stand idly by, so they initiated the organization of the Volunteer Army to aid the Korean people in resisting aggression, driving the American aggressor army back from the Yalu River to the 38th parallel. This is the basic reason why the American imperialists are particularly hostile to the Chinese people today, and it is also the basic reason why the American imperialists in the East want to further collude with the Japanese Zaibatsu and militarists, conclude a one-sided treaty, and intensify the arming of Japan. The American imperialists in the East want to use the Japanese militarists and Zaibatsu as cat's paws to retrieve chestnuts from the fire for them. We can understand this. This is precisely the wishful thinking of the American imperialists. But today, under such a clear situation, are there still patriotic Japanese people who can willingly be cannon fodder for the American rulers and refuse to rise up and actively resist?

The Yoshida government is a government fostered under the wings of the American rulers. It represents the interests of the American rulers and the Japanese Zaibatsu and militarists, not the interests of the Japanese people. The Yoshida government and the remnants of the Japanese militarists and Zaibatsu may have used such reasons to deceive you: taking advantage of the opposition between the two major camps in the world, taking advantage of the contradictions between the United States and Britain and China and the Soviet Union, it may be possible to side with the United States and Britain and revive Japan. Such words are not easy to say publicly in Japan. But I dare to believe that the Japanese reactionaries will inevitably use Hitler's old tricks, using a very tempting fantasy to induce the trust of the Japanese people and paralyze the opposition of the Japanese people.

The Japanese people, like us Chinese people, are a diligent, brave, and patriotic nation. But the Japanese Zaibatsu and militarists once stole your patriotism to satisfy their greedy desires and caused you great disasters. More than a decade ago, they called for "Showa Restoration" and launched a large-scale war of aggression against China and the Pacific War under the title of "Mikuni no Tame" ("For the Motherland"), which almost destroyed your country. Today, the blood debts of the old war have not yet been settled, and the Japanese militarists and Zaibatsu are obviously going to use you again under the instruction of American imperialism. But your country today is controlled by American imperialists. If you want to engage in war again, wouldn't it only be said to be "for America"?

To revitalize Japan, there is only hope by taking the people's route. Although we Chinese people have a deep blood feud with the Japanese militarists and Zaibatsu, we have always cherished brotherly friendship with the Japanese people. As long as the Japanese people truly become the masters of Japan, China and Japan will definitely be able to achieve satisfactory friendly cooperation.

Japan's fate today, undeniably, is the same as our China's fate before liberation, and has basically become a colony of the United States. Under such circumstances, the Japanese reactionaries' demand for "revival" is exactly the same as Chiang Kai-shek's era's shouting for "revival," which is completely a dream. During the period from 1933 to 1941, Hitler's Germany was still able to take advantage of opportunities and run rampant for a while, but today's Japan does not have this condition. Japan is already a colony of the United States, which is fundamentally different from Hitler's Germany. Moreover, even if the Japanese reactionaries, under the control of the United States, still "revive," can they have the confidence to oppose the combined forces of China, the Soviet Union, and all the people of Asia? This is something that the old Japan, which accumulated decades of strength, could not possibly accomplish. Moreover, Hitler's "revival" is precisely a lesson from the past. The Third Reich "revived" by Hitler collapsed before the Soviet people. Today's China is different from the old China. Today's Asia is different from the old Asia. With the great strength of the Soviet people plus the strength of the Chinese people and the Asian people, what will be the future of the dreamed-of "Second Empire Japan"?

We have long had precautions. On February 14, 1950, we, China and the Soviet Union, already had the signing of the "Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance." The goal of the treaty clearly stipulates that in order to "consolidate lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world," in order to "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or other countries colluding with Japan in aggressive acts in any form." We have long foreseen that the collusion between American imperialists and Japanese reactionaries would reach such a point today, and it will become even more in-depth, so we have already taken precautions. We welcome the resurgence of the Japanese people. The Japanese people, like all peace-loving working people in the world, must obtain a happy life of democracy and freedom, and they will eventually obtain it. But the "resurgence of Japanese imperialism," for our own security, for the security of Asia and the world, and also for the security of the Japanese people, we cannot but do our best to oppose it. Then, we can clearly assert: if the situation progresses according to the reactionary's agenda, the future of the imaginary "Second Empire Japan" will undoubtedly be even more tragic than the future of Hitler's Third Reich!

Japanese friends, this is not alarmist talk, this is a scientific prediction, a reality as clear as fire. Therefore, in order to avoid this tragic future, in order to avoid the future massive bloodshed of the Asian people and the people of the world, we believe that the Japanese people have an absolute necessity: to quickly rise up, unite, organize, resist the treasonous acts of the reactionary faction of their own country and the criminal plans of the American imperialists. As long as the Japanese people unite and resolutely resist, even if the illegal, ghostly peace treaty with Japan is signed, it will be invalid.

Japanese friends, you all know that only the power of the people is the greatest irresistible force. We, the Chinese people, have put forward the freshest practical evidence. We, the Chinese people, fought for more than a hundred years to win the independence and freedom of our motherland, and finally, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, won glorious liberation. The traitorous treaties that have harmed the country and the people, such as the "Sino-US Commercial Treaty," concluded by successive reactionary governments, especially the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the imperialists, have not all become waste paper today, when the people are the masters? Our experience in struggle is very valuable and worth your absorption. The struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism, should become your guide to action today. American imperialism is our mortal enemy, and it should also be your mortal enemy. American imperialists are the most selfish, the most cruel, the most despicable, and the most hypocritical. It was none other than the American imperialists who dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not for the needs of the anti-fascist war, but purely for the needs of imperialist hegemony! It is none other than the American imperialists who have occupied Japan for six years, bullying and oppressing the Japanese people in a domineering way! You should be clearer than we are about the "benevolence" of the American imperialists to the Japanese people. Therefore, today's answer to the demands of American imperialists should be to go in the opposite direction. What it welcomes, we will never welcome, what it does not welcome, we absolutely welcome. This is an extremely simple but extremely correct guide to action. As long as the Japanese people unite and act under such a policy, it will show your great strength and strive for the realization of the people's Japan. The lasting peace and universal security of Asia and the world can also be further guaranteed.

Work hard, all patriotic friends in Japan! At this dangerous juncture, work hard to save your country! Strive together to realize the people's Japan! Strive together to oppose American aggression and defend world peace! I salute you with revolutionary brotherly respect!

### 一封给日本人民的公开信

    一封给日本人民的公开信
    郭沫若日本的工人、农民、青年学生、进步的知识分子和其他一切爱国的朋友们：
    我现在要以一个在日本受过高等教育、前后住了整整二十年的旧友的资格，向你们写出这一封公开信。你们的祖国，我认为，又临到了最危险的关头了。你们是真正为国家着想的人，你们应该更积极地振奋起来，团结起来，组织起来，尽力地从事挽救。
    美国和它的仆从英国所单独拟订的“对日和约草案”已经公布了，而且准备以九月四日在旧金山开会签订。你们的吉田政府正表示着受宠若惊的态度，决定去参加，并接受这个片面的和约。这就是我所感觉着的：你们的祖国又临到了最危险的关头。
    “和约草案”是根本不合法的，它彻头彻尾违反了一切国际协定，违反了世界人民的利益，尤其是对于我们中国人民采取着绝对敌视的态度。它把我们抗战八年的努力全部抹杀了，否定了我们共同草拟和约的合法权利，并根本拒绝了我们签订和约的权利。这种专横恣肆的帝国主义的态度，是我们中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。八月十五日我们的外交部周恩来部长已经发表了严正的声明：“对日和约的准备、拟制和签订，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其内容和结果如何，中央人民政府一概认为是非法的，因而也是无效的。”这正是代表我们全中国人民的正义的呼声，全世界公正的人民都在热烈地响应。
    但美国统治阶级要急于签订这样不合法的片面对日和约，而且要特别仇视我们中华人民共和国，我们倒是能够理解的。二次大战结束后，为争取殖民地而战的轴心国家被击溃了，英法等有大量殖民地的资本主义国家也在战争中被削弱了，因而便诱发了美帝国主义者独霸世界的野心。为了满足这项野心，美帝国主义者在六年期间所表演出的疯狂的悲喜剧是数不清的。但他们的疯狂，在中国人民面前遭受了最沉重的打击。首先是我们中国人民革命的成功，我们把美国所大力扶持的蒋介石匪帮从大陆上完全肃清了，把一百多年来的美国侵略势力也完全驱逐了。去年六月，美国发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，并危害到我们祖国的安全，我们中国人民不能置之不理，故又发起了志愿军的组织，援助朝鲜人民抗战，把美国侵略军从鸭绿江边赶回到了三八线。这就是美帝国主义者在今天要特别仇视我们中国人民的基本原因，也就是美帝国主义者在东方要更进一步和日本的财阀军阀勾结，缔结片面和约，加紧武装日本的基本原因。美帝国主义者在东方是想利用日本的军阀财阀作为猫脚爪，替他们从火中取栗，这是我们所能理解的。这正是美帝国主义者的如意算盘。但在今天，在这样明如观火的情势之下，爱国的日本人民难道还有人能甘心做美国统治者的炮灰，而不肯振奋起来积极地进行反抗的吗？
    吉田政府是在美国统治者羽翼之下扶植起来的政府。它所代表的是美国统治者和日本财阀军阀的利益，而不是日本人民的利益。吉田政府和日本军阀财阀的残余分子可能曾以这样的理由来蒙蔽你们：利用世界上两大阵营的对立，利用美英和中苏之间的矛盾，不妨倒在美国和英国的一边，把日本复兴起来再说。这样的话在日本是不好公开说出来的。但我敢于相信，日本反动派必然是袭用希特勒的故技，用一个很有诱惑力的幻想，来诱致日本人民的信赖，麻痹日本人民的反对。
    日本人民，和我们中国人民一样，是勤劳、勇敢、而富于爱国心的民族。但日本的财阀和军阀曾经盗用了你们的爱国心来满足他们贪婪的欲望而使你们遭受到极大的灾难。十几年前它们号召着“昭和维新”，在“御国之为”（“Miknni no Tame”“为了祖国”）的题目之下发动了大规模的侵华战争和太平洋战争，使你们的祖国几乎覆灭了。今天旧战争的血债还未清算，日本的军阀财阀显然又在美帝国主义的指使下要来利用你们了。但你们的祖国今天是操纵在美帝国主义者手中，假如你们再要从事战争，那岂不是只好说是“为了美国”吗？
    要使日本复兴，只有走人民的路线才有希望。我们中国人民对于日本的军阀财阀虽然有着血海深仇，但对日本人民是向来怀着兄弟般的友谊的。只要日本人民真正做了日本的主人，中日两国是一定能够实现圆满的友好互助的。
    日本今天的命运，无可讳言，已同于我们中国未解放前的命运一样，基本上已成为美国的殖民地了。日本反动派在这样的情势之下要求“复兴”，也就和蒋介石时代高喊“复兴”的一样，完全是梦想。在一九三三年到一九四一年期间，希特勒德国还能利用机会，猖獗一时，但是今天的日本却没有这种条件。日本已经是美国的殖民地，这是和希特勒德国根本不同的。而且即使日本反动派在美国的支配之下，仍然“复兴”了起来，又难道能有自信敌对中苏两国和亚洲人民全体的力量吗？这是旧时代的日本积蓄了几十年的力量所没有可能办到的事。而且希特勒式的“复兴”正好是一个前车之戒。希特勒所“复兴”的第三帝国是在苏联人民之前溃灭了。今天的中国已经不同于旧日的中国。今天的亚洲已经不同于旧日的亚洲。在苏联人民的大力之上再加上中国人民和亚洲人民的力量，梦想中的“第二帝国日本”的前途究竟会是怎样呢？
    我们是早就有了未雨的绸缪的。在一九五○年二月十四日我们中苏两国之间已经有了“友好同盟互助条约”的缔订。条约的目标明白规定着，为了要“巩固远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全”，为了要“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其它用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”。我们早就预料到美帝国主义者和日本反动派的勾结会达到今天这样的地步，而且会更加深入的，故我们已经早为之防。日本人民之再起，我们是欢迎的。日本人民，和全世界爱好和平的劳动人民一样，必须得到民主自由的幸福生活，而且终究是要得到的。但“日本帝国主义之再起”，我们为了自己的安全，为了亚洲和世界的安全，也为了日本人民的安全，却不能不用尽全力来反对。那吗，我们可以明白地断言：假使局面照着反动派的日程进展下去，假想中的“第二帝国日本”的前途，毫无疑问，会比希特勒的第三帝国的前途还要悲惨！
    日本的朋友们，这不是危辞恫胁，这是科学性的预言，是明如观火的现实。故尔为了免掉这种悲惨的前途，为了免掉亚洲人民和世界人民未来的大量流血，我们认为日本人民是有绝对的必要：迅速地振奋起来、团结起来、组织起来，反抗本国反动派的卖国行为和美帝国主义者的罪恶计划。只要日本人民一致起来坚决地反抗，非法的鬼蜮的对日和约即使签订了，它也无效。
    日本的朋友们，你们都知道，只有人民的力量才是最伟大的不可反抗的力量。我们中国人民就提出了一个最新鲜的实证。我们中国人民为争取祖国的独立自由斗争了一百多年，而终于在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导之下，获得了光荣的解放。历来的反动政府，特别是蒋介石匪帮，和帝国主义者所缔结的祸国殃民的卖国条约，例如“中美商约”之类，在人民作了主人的今天，不是都成为了废纸吗？我们的斗争经验是很可宝贵的，是值得你们吸取的。反对帝国主义的斗争，尤其反对美帝国主义，在今天应该成为你们的行动指南。美帝国主义是我们的死敌，也应该是你们的死敌。美帝国主义者是最自私、最残忍、最卑劣、最伪善的。不是为着反法西斯战争的需要，仅仅为着帝国主义霸权的需要，在广岛和长崎投了两枚原子弹的，不是别人，正是美帝国主义者！占领日本六年，横行霸道地欺侮压迫日本人民的，不是别人，正是美帝国主义者！美帝国主义者对于日本人民的“恩惠”，你们应该比我们更加清楚。故在今天对于美帝国主义者的要求的回答，就应该是反其道而行。它所欢迎的，我们决不欢迎，它所不欢迎的，我们绝对欢迎。这是一个极简单而却极正确的行动指南。日本人民只要在这样的方针之下，一致团结起来，行动起来，那便会表现出你们的伟大力量，而争取到人民日本的实现。亚洲的和世界的持久和平与普遍安全也就可以得到更进一步的保障了。
    努力吧，全日本的爱国的朋友们！在危险的关头努力挽救你们的祖国！为实现人民日本而一致奋斗！为反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平而一致奋斗！我向你们致革命的兄弟的敬礼！
