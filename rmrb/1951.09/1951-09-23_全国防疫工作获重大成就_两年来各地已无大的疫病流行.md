Major achievements have been made in national epidemic prevention work. For the past two years, there have been no major epidemics in various parts of the country, and the incidence and mortality rates of several severe infectious diseases such as smallpox, cholera, and plague have been significantly reduced.

According to statistics, since the spring of 1950, 180 million people nationwide have been vaccinated against smallpox. In the Northeast region, the number of people vaccinated has reached 90% of the region's population. The number of smallpox cases in the region in the first half of this year decreased by 92% compared to the second half of last year. Cities such as Beijing, Lushun-Dalian, Yingkou, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Xiamen, and Guangzhou have had no cases of smallpox for the past two years.

Cholera was introduced to China in 1820 and has occurred annually since then. The last major epidemic was in 1946. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 54,197 cholera patients were found throughout the country in 1946, with 15,460 deaths. Imperialist scholars falsely claimed that cholera epidemics had a cyclical nature, with a major epidemic occurring every three to five years. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, thanks to strengthened traffic quarantine, drinking water disinfection, environmental sanitation, and early preventive injections, no cases of true cholera have occurred in the past two years, and the number of cases of typhoid and dysentery has also decreased.

Prevention and control stations have been established in the eight plague-prone areas of Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Chahar, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Yunnan, mobilizing the masses to catch rats and eliminate fleas on a large scale. In the past two years, Northeast China and Inner Mongolia alone have caught 50 million rats. In Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Chahar and other historically plague-stricken areas, the spread of plague was first controlled last year. The number of cases in Inner Mongolia last year was 22, equivalent to about one-thousandth of the incidence rate in 1947. From January to June this year, the total number of cases nationwide has been 447, a decrease of 78% compared to the same period last year. The cure rate for plague across the country has also increased by 20% compared to last year.

Soviet experts and Soviet epidemic prevention teams have provided great assistance to our country in epidemic prevention work. For example, when plague occurred in Chabei in the winter of 1949, the Soviet epidemic prevention team not only helped to stop the spread of the plague, but also enabled our epidemic prevention personnel to learn advanced epidemic prevention experience.

As of now, health agencies at all levels across the country have organized 115 epidemic prevention teams ranging in size from a dozen to more than a hundred people, and established 135 epidemic prevention stations (professional epidemic prevention stations not included in the statistics). Basic-level health organizations have been established in most key epidemic prevention areas, enabling the epidemic prevention movement to spread from local areas to all areas. Due to the development of basic-level health organizations and the expansion of the epidemic prevention movement, the people's awareness of health work has generally increased, and epidemic situations in various places can be reported in a timely manner. During the epidemic prevention movement, major cities and vast rural areas across the country have carried out work to improve environmental sanitation, such as repairing sewers, improving water sources, building toilets, removing garbage, and strengthening food management. The filling of the Longxugou in Beijing and the Chilong River in Tianjin, two places where filthy water had accumulated, are prominent examples.

In particular, in the past two years, the central government and various regions have promptly organized epidemic prevention teams to go deep into disaster areas in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, the Pingyuan area, Hebei, Henan, and Chahar, as well as river engineering areas such as the Huai River and the Yi River, to carry out epidemic prevention work, ensuring the health of tens of millions of people in disaster areas and millions of laborers. Medical and health institutions in various places have also successively organized volunteer epidemic prevention teams and international medical and epidemic prevention teams to go to the Korean front to carry out epidemic prevention work for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The Seventh Brigade of the Central Epidemic Prevention General Team went to areas inhabited by Tibetans and Mongolians in Gansu and Qinghai to carry out epidemic prevention and treatment work. In addition, the teachers and students of the Peking University Medical College and the Chinese Union Medical College organized anti-venereal disease teams during the summer vacations this year and last year to go to the grasslands of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia to assist local people's governments in carrying out venereal disease prevention and control work.

Significant results have also been achieved in the prevention and control of chronic infectious diseases such as kala-azar and Japanese schistosomiasis. In the past two years, more than 100,000 patients have been cured in areas where kala-azar is prevalent, such as Shandong, Pingyuan, and northern Jiangsu, and specialized prevention and control stations have been established. In order to prevent tuberculosis, 850,000 children in 82 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Nanjing, and Xi'an have been vaccinated with BCG.

In order to ensure the supply of vaccines and serums for epidemic prevention work, the health agencies of the central government and major administrative regions have expanded the production of biological products. The output of biological products is now more than ten times higher than during the reactionary government era. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国防疫工作获重大成就
    两年来各地已无大的疫病流行
    全国防疫工作获重大成就。两年来全国各地已无大的疫病流行，并且几种烈性的疫病，如天花、霍乱、鼠疫等的发病率与死亡率已显著减低。
    据统计，自一九五零年春季起到目前止，全国已有一亿八千万人种了牛痘，其中东北区种痘人数已达全区人口百分之九十。该区今年上半年发生天花的人数较去年下半年减少了百分之九十二。北京、旅大、营口、秦皇岛、烟台、厦门、广州等城市，两年来根本未发生天花病例。
    霍乱是一八二零年传入中国的，以后曾年年发生。最后一次大流行是在一九四六年。据不完全统计，一九四六年全国各地共发现霍乱病人五万四千一百九十七人，死亡一万五千四百六十人。帝国主义学者妄称霍乱流行是有周期性的，三、五年必有一次大流行。自中央人民政府成立以来，由于加强了交通检疫，饮水消毒，环境卫生以及早期预防注射等工作，两年来未发生一个真性霍乱病人，同时减少了伤寒与痢疾的发病人数。
    在东北、内蒙、察哈尔、福建、浙江、江西、广东、云南八个鼠疫流行中心区，均设立了防治所，发动群众大量捕鼠、灭蚤。前年和去年只东北和内蒙两地就捕鼠五千万只。在东北、内蒙、察哈尔等几处历史上的疫区，去年首先控制了鼠疫的流行。内蒙去年全年发病数二十二人，约合一九四七年发病率的千分之一。今年一至六月全国发病人数到目前止共四百四十七人，较去年同期发病人数减低了百分之七十八。全国各地对鼠疫的治愈率也较去年提高百分之二十。
    苏联专家和苏联防疫队在防疫工作上给我国很大的帮助。如察北一九四九年冬季发生鼠疫，苏联防疫队不仅帮助制止了鼠疫的蔓延，并且使我国防疫人员学到了先进的防疫经验。
    全国各级卫生机关，到目前为止已组织了从十余人到百余人不等的防疫队一百一十五队，建立防疫站（所）一百三十五个（专业性的防疫站未统计在内）。各防疫重点地区大部分都建立了基层卫生组织，使防疫运动由局部地区向全面展开。由于全国卫生基层组织的发展和防疫运动的扩大，人民对卫生工作的认识普遍提高，各地发现疫情都能及时报告。在防疫运动中，全国各大城市及广大乡村开展了改善环境卫生工作，如修整下水道，改良水源，修建厕所，清除垃圾，加强饮食管理等。北京的龙须沟和天津的赤龙河两处秽水聚积地的填垫就是显著的例子。
    特别是两年来中央和各地区都及时地组织了防疫队，深入苏北、皖北、平原、河北、河南、察哈尔等地灾区，以及治淮、导沂等河工地区开展防疫工作，保障了数千万灾区人民和数百万民工的健康。各地医疗卫生机构并先后组织了志愿防疫队、国际医防队去朝鲜前线，为中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军进行防疫工作。中央防疫总队第七大队曾赴甘肃、青海的藏族、蒙族集居地区进行防疫和治疗工作。此外，北京大学医学院、中国协和医学院两校师生在今年和去年暑假里都组织了抗梅队，去绥远、内蒙草原，协助地方人民政府开展性病防治工作。
    对慢性传染病如黑热病、日本住血吸虫病等的防治工作也收到很大效果。两年来在山东、平原、苏北等黑热病流行地区，已治愈十余万病人，并设立了专业防治所。为了预防结核病，在北京、上海、沈阳、南京、西安等八十二个城市的儿童中，接种卡介苗计八十五万人。
    为保障防疫工作中疫苗、血清的供应，中央及各大行政区的卫生机构都扩大了生物制品的生产工作。现在生物制品的产量超过了反动政府时代的十倍以上。（新华社）
