    (II) Emphasizing the Payment and Collection Work of Weapon Donations
    The progress of payment and collection work for weapon donations is currently uneven across the country. In some areas, due to the emphasis placed on leading the payment work and viewing it as a decisive link in the entire weapon donation movement after the formulation of increased production and donation plans, concrete assistance was provided to the people in formulating payment plans and resolving difficulties. This ensured that the original donation plans could be completed as scheduled. For example, by September 5th, the industrial and commercial circles of Dalian had paid more than half of the total planned donation amount, and they guaranteed to complete all payment work by the end of October. In Wuxi, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, and other places, some units adopted the method of collective payment, which involved joint consultation to determine a unified time, which could both supervise and check each other, and save time and manpower. In Wuxi, eighty-three industries and businesses collectively paid the first installment of donations in late August. However, in some areas, due to a lack of leadership in the payment work, serious backwardness exists. For example, the industrial and commercial circles of Jilin City pledged to donate three fighter planes, originally planning to pay 1.8 billion by the end of August, but actually only paid 133.3 million, less than one-tenth of the original plan.
    Closely related to the payment work is the collection work. Although some areas have partially completed the payment work, the lack of leadership in the collection work has resulted in a large amount of funds not being promptly submitted to the People's Bank of China. For example, eight institutions, including the North China People's Revolutionary University in Beijing, either locked the donations in safes, or mixed the collected donations with their own institutional funds; like the North China People's Revolutionary University, they had 700 million in donations that were not submitted in a timely manner, but were deposited in the bank in their own name. Even more serious is that some places have seen instances of embezzlement and corruption of people's donations. According to the Shanxi Daily on August 7th, the Linfen Prefectural Commissioner's Office and its individual subordinate agencies used 9.44 million yuan of donations to buy prize-linked savings bonds. In Xian County and Cang County in Hebei, Jiangling, Xiaogan, and Luotian counties in Hubei Province, and individual units in Dihua City, Xinjiang, individual personnel were found to have embezzled the patriotic donations of the people. Although these facts are isolated, they are serious and must be dealt with promptly. Collection agencies and collectors in various places must implement the regulations in the Association's June 7th notice regarding the prompt transfer of donations to the People's Bank of China, and the monthly public announcement to the people of the collection of donations at each level, strictly prevent illegal acts of embezzlement or misappropriation of patriotic donations, and treat the payment and collection work of weapon donations seriously and solemnly.

    （二）重视捐献武器的交款收款工作
    捐献武器的交款收款工作，目前在全国各地发展的情况是不平衡的。有的地方由于重视了交款工作的领导，把交款工作看作是增产捐献计划订立后整个捐献武器运动的一个决定性的环节，具体地帮助人民群众制订交款的计划和解决困难，这样便保证了原来的捐献计划能够如期完成。如大连工商界至九月五日为止，交款总数已达计划捐献总数的二分之一强，并保证十月底全部完成交款工作。无锡、武汉、郑州、石家庄等地若干单位采取了集体交款的办法，这种办法是共同协商，确定统一的时间，既可相互督促检查，又能节省时间和人力。无锡工商界八十三个行业于八月下旬集体交纳了第一期捐款。但有的地方，由于交款工作缺乏领导，交款工作存在着严重的落后状态。如吉林市工商界认捐战斗机三架，原计划在八月底交十八亿，实际上才交了一亿三千三百余万元，不及原计划的十分之一。
    和交款工作密切有关的是收款工作。有的地方虽然交款工作已经部分完成，但由于收款工作缺乏领导，致使大批款项未能及时送交中国人民银行。如北京华北人民革命大学等八个机关，他们有的是把献款锁在保险柜里；有的将收到的献款和自己的机关经费混在一起；像华北人民革命大学，他们有献款七亿元，没有及时上缴，而用自己的名义存入了银行。更严重的是有些地方发生了挪用、贪污群众献款的事实。据八月七日山西日报载称：临汾专署及其个别所属机关用捐款九百四十四万买了有奖储蓄奖券。河北献县、沧县，湖北省江陵、孝感、罗田等县，新疆迪化市的个别单位都发现了个别人员贪污人民群众爱国献款的事实。这些事实虽然是个别的，但是是严重的，必须迅速地加以处理。各地收款机关和收款人员必须执行本会六月七日通知中关于将捐款迅速解交人民银行，和每月把收缴献款情况逐级向人民群众公布一次的规定，严防贪污或挪用爱国捐款的不法行为，认真严肃地对待捐献武器的交款收款工作。
