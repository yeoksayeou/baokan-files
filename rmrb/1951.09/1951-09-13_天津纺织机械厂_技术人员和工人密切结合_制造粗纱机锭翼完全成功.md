Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory
    Technicians and Workers Closely Collaborate
    Manufacturing Roving Frame Flyers Completely Successful
    Technicians and workers at the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, under the North China Textile Administration Bureau, closely collaborated and successfully manufactured roving frame flyers. The flyer is a major component of the roving frame, accounting for over fifteen percent of the roving frame's manufacturing cost. In the past, China did not have complete tools for manufacturing flyers and could only produce them manually, resulting in poor quality and quantity. Therefore, most of the required flyers were imported from capitalist countries. This situation greatly hindered the development of China's textile industry. After receiving the task of customizing roving frames from the Central Textile Industry Department in September of last year, the leading cadres of the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory called on all employees to overcome technical difficulties, break the imperialist blockade, and actively trial-produce flyers. During the trial production process, workers put forward many rationalization proposals, which were analyzed and studied by technicians before being implemented. Some of these proposals corrected errors in the work of the technicians, and others were perfected by the technicians' additions. This not only reversed the conservative thinking of individual technicians, but also effectively combined theoretical guidance with operational experience. After more than four months of effort, more than forty kinds of tools necessary for manufacturing flyers were finally created. Then, in May of this year, the flyer was officially trial-produced successfully. According to preliminary tests, the quality of the flyer has exceeded the standards of some imported goods in the past.

    天津纺织机械厂
    技术人员和工人密切结合
    制造粗纱机锭翼完全成功
    华北纺织管理局天津纺织机械厂技术人员与工人密切结合，制造粗纱机锭翼成功。锭翼为粗纱机的一个主要机件，占制造粗纱机成本的百分之十五强。过去我国没有完整的制造锭翼的工具，只能用手工制造，产品的质和量都很差。因此，所需锭翼大都是从资本主义国家输入。这种情况对我国纺织工业的发展妨碍很大。去年九月，天津纺织机械厂接到中央纺织工业部定制粗纱机的任务后，该厂领导干部号召全体职工克服技术困难，粉碎帝国主义的封锁，积极试制锭翼。在试制过程中，工人们提出了很多合理化建议，由技师加以分析研究，然后实行。这些建议，有的纠正了技师在工作上的错误，有的经过技师的补充而更加完美。这一方面扭转了个别技师的保守思想，另方面使理论指导与操作经验很好地结合了起来。经过四个多月的努力，终于创造出制造锭翼所必需的四十多种工具。接着，今年五月锭翼正式试制成功。据初步试验，锭翼品质已超过过去一些进口货的标准。
