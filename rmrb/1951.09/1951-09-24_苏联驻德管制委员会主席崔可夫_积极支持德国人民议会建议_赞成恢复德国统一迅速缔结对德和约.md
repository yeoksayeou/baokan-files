Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: According to the TASS news agency, a reporter from the German News Agency asked Chairman Chuikov of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany about the attitude of the Soviet Control Commission regarding the proposal by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to the Bonn Parliament to convene an all-German conference to hold all-German elections and accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Chuikov replied that he believed that the People's Chamber's proposal expressed the legitimate desire of the people's elected representatives to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany and to ensure lasting peace and Germany's independent existence. The German people and their elected bodies have the right to undertake the cause of restoring German unity based on democratic and peaceful principles, and they also have the right to express their opinions on the need to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty. This right of the German people is directly stipulated by the Potsdam Conference decisions. The existing division of Germany cannot and should not continue. The German people, supported by peace-loving people of all countries, can eliminate this division through their own efforts.

Chuikov pointed out that the People's Chamber's proposal to hold an all-German conference to discuss the demand for accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty is undoubtedly just. Joint action by representatives from East and West Germany on this issue can greatly contribute to the peaceful resolution of the German question and the preparation and signing of a peace treaty with Germany. It must be noted that countries occupying West Germany, which are now attempting to replace the conclusion of a peace treaty with empty declarations about so-called "ending the state of war," must take into account the opinions of the German people, who have an indisputable right and the support of peace-loving people.

Chuikov finally declared that the Soviet government has always been in favor of restoring Germany's unity based on democratic and peaceful principles, and is in favor of the swift conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, followed by the withdrawal of all occupation forces. Therefore, any efforts made by representatives from East and West Germany in this regard will receive the most active and absolutely selfless support from the Soviet Union.

    苏联驻德管制委员会主席崔可夫
    积极支持德国人民议会建议
    赞成恢复德国统一迅速缔结对德和约
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：德意志通讯社记者就德意志民主共和国人民议会向波恩议会提出召开全德会议以举行全德选举并加速缔结对德和约的建议，向苏联驻德管制委员会主席崔可夫提出问题，询问苏联管制委员会对于这个建议的态度。崔可夫答复说：他认为，人民议会的这个建议，表达了人民选出的代表们所怀抱的建立统一、民主及爱好和平的德国以及确保持久和平与德国的独立生存的合理愿望，德国人民以及他们所选出的机关，有权利把根据民主与和平原则恢复德国统一的事业担当起来，而且，他们也有权利就必须加速缔结和约一事，提出自己的意见。德国人民的这种权利，是直接由波茨坦会议的决定所规定的。德国现存的分裂局面，不能而且不应该继续下去。受到爱好和平的各国人民支持的德国人民，依靠他们自己的努力，能够把这种分裂局面消除。
    崔可夫指出：人民议会关于举行全德会议以讨论加速缔结和约的要求的建议，无疑是公正的。东德和西德代表在这个问题上采取联合一致的行动，可以大有助于和平解决德国问题和准备与签订对德和约。必须注意：现在企图用关于所谓“结束战争状态”的空洞声明来代替缔结对德和约的占领西德的国家，必须考虑到德国人民的意见，德国人民有着无可争辩的权利以及爱好和平人民的支持。
    崔可夫最后宣称：苏联政府过去和现在都赞成根据民主与和平的原则恢复德国的统一，并赞成迅速缔结对德和约，随后撤退一切占领军。因此，东德和西德代表在这方面所作的任何努力，一定会得到苏联的最积极的、绝对大公无私的支持。
