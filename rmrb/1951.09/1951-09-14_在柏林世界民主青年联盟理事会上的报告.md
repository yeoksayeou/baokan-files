Feng Wenbin

Editor's Note: Following the conclusion of the 3rd World Youth and Student Festival for Peace, the World Federation of Democratic Youth convened its council meeting in Berlin from August 21st to 24th. A total of 215 youth organizations from 91 countries participated and attended. The agenda included: discussing the achievements of the 3rd World Youth and Student Festival for Peace, the tasks of youth in strengthening unity and safeguarding peace, the convening of the International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights, and the approval of new member organizations joining the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Thirty-six new member organizations from twenty-six countries applied for membership, including ten countries that were engaging with the World Federation of Democratic Youth for the first time. Following approval, the number of countries participating in the World Federation of Democratic Youth increased to 84, with over 72 million members. The youth representatives from various countries unanimously affirmed the great achievements of this festival, expressed their determination to unite and safeguard peace and prevent new war dangers, and passed resolutions on the achievements of the festival and the convening of the International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights next year. The Chinese youth delegation attending this council meeting was composed of Feng Wenbin, Wu Han, Rong Gaotang, Qu Tangliang, Zhao Fusan, Qian Dawei, etc., with Feng Wenbin as the head of the delegation. The following is Feng Wenbin's report to the council.

Dear friends,

This council meeting is convened immediately following the 3rd World Youth and Student Festival for Peace. The victory of this festival in the cause of world youth unity and safeguarding peace is unprecedented. More than 26,000 young people from 104 countries, as well as 2 million young Germans, regardless of differences in nationality, language, political or religious belief, or social status, unanimously and strongly expressed their desire to safeguard peace, and in particular, they resolutely demanded the immediate conclusion of a five-power pact guaranteeing the peaceful coexistence of all countries, and will mobilize all forces to launch this movement. This is a powerful blow and demonstration against the warmongers who are actively preparing for a new world war. Its impact is extremely significant, and it will inevitably be expanded and deepened as the youth representatives of various countries convey it upon their return home.

Our Chinese youth delegation fully agrees with the report made by the President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Billinguer, at the council meeting, agrees with his assessment of the festival, and agrees with the future work policies he proposed in his report. Chinese youth will make every effort to expand and deepen the impact of the festival.

So, what is the harvest that the festival has given to Chinese youth?

First of all, it has greatly strengthened the determination and confidence of Chinese youth in jointly defending world peace with youth from all over the world. The festival demonstrated that peace is an invincible force. Peace can unite all good people and youth, and can mobilize the broadest masses to fight against the enemies of peace. At the festival, we saw that our friends who are fighting for peace are all over the world. We saw the great achievements of our role models, the Soviet youth, nurtured by the great Stalin, in peaceful construction, and their achievements in culture and art have already powerfully demonstrated what a happy life the socialist system will bring to mankind. We saw the great achievements of the German people and German youth, under the leadership of President Pieck, in opposing the arming of West Germany and striving for the democratic, unified, and peaceful unification of their motherland. We saw the great determination and fighting spirit of the Korean and Vietnamese youth who are engaged in arduous struggles against imperialism to win national independence. We also saw that the struggles of young peace fighters in every corner of the world are developing victoriously. And our Chinese youth representatives, the young labor models and young combat heroes in our delegation, especially the young combat heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers, were welcomed and loved by peace-loving young friends from all over the world.

We had many enthusiastic gatherings with young friends from all over the world in Berlin. Under this high spirit of internationalism united for peace, we deeply felt that we are in the mighty ranks fighting to defend peace, and this ranks will become more and more extensive and more powerful after the festival.

Secondly, the festival played an important role in promoting the exchange of cultural and artistic programs among the youth of various countries. The cultural and artistic programs of Chinese youth were welcomed by the youth participating in the festival. In the future, the young cultural and artistic workers of New China will strive even harder in the direction of combining ideology and artistry for the struggle for peace, democracy and people's liberation, and for serving the working people.

At the same time, at the festival, Chinese youth enthusiastically and sincerely told young peace fighters all over the world of their determination and confidence in loving peace and being willing to contribute all their strength to peace. The Chinese people and Chinese youth love peace. Our liberation struggle over the years was precisely to realize a peaceful and constructive social condition for a better future. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the help of the people of various countries, especially the Soviet people, we have achieved victory. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in order to enhance and consolidate the forces for defending peace, our achievements in production and construction have been remarkable. For example, in terms of industrial construction, most of our industrial production has recovered to the level before the Anti-Japanese War (and China has been in a state of war for the fourteen years since the Anti-Japanese War). The steel and textile industries have even exceeded their original levels. New factories are being built, and new railways are being opened up. Young workers and adult workers across the country, under the banner of patriotism, have launched a heated production movement. For example, the Liu Lifu production team of the Communist Youth League members in Dalian completed an average of more than 280% of their monthly tasks at the beginning of this year, and completed eight months of production tasks in three months. Last year, there were 17,113 young workers in the Northeast region alone who created new records. Our agricultural production, because of the completion of land reform for nearly 300 million people, has enabled farmers to increase their income by 7.5 million tons of grain every year. The great increase in farmers' enthusiasm for production has led to significant development in agricultural production. Our cotton production has exceeded the level before the Anti-Japanese War, and grain not only stopped the situation of needing to import for many years, but can also be exported. The scale of New China's water conservancy projects is greater than any period in history. This year alone, the harnessing of the Huai River mobilized 2.2 million people to work simultaneously. The development of education is extremely significant. 1.25 million workers have entered spare-time schools, and 25 million farmers have entered winter schools. Taking Northeast as an example, the number of middle school students has increased by 172.5% compared with the period of reactionary rule, and the increase in elementary school students is even more rapid. The number of elementary school students across the country has reached more than 37 million. The beautiful prospects for our peaceful construction are very bright and splendid.

However, our desire for peaceful construction is not tolerated by the American aggressors. The American aggressors, who deliberately sabotage world peace, are following the old path of the Japanese imperialists, first invading the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and leading the war of aggression from Korea to the Chinese border. They directly invaded our Taiwan, and they rudely strafed and bombed our people. In this way, the peace of the East and the world is facing the danger of being destroyed by the American warmongers. The Chinese people and Chinese youth, who have long struggled against imperialism, deeply know that peace cannot be obtained by begging and waiting. Peace must be won. Therefore, in order to defend the East and prevent the peace of the world from being destroyed, the Chinese people have shouldered the most important task of defending peace - we were forced to organize volunteers and the Korean People's Army to resist the aggression of American imperialism side by side. From the first day of the Korean War, the Chinese people and youth have advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. During the same period, 343.8 million Chinese people and youth signed a petition calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, and more than 200 million people participated in peace parades. The goal of the movement requires that the entire nation should be "familiar with" resisting America and aiding Korea. Precisely because Chinese youth understand that supporting Korea is defending our hometown and motherland, and is defending Eastern peace and world peace; precisely because our struggle to defend peace is just, on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea, countless youth in the volunteer army have demonstrated the highest degree of heroism and self-sacrifice. And the fact has proven that the seemingly powerful American imperialists, under the resistance of the Chinese and Korean people, and under our correct strategy of eliminating their effective strength regardless of the gains and losses of cities, have suffered more than 200,000 American soldiers killed and wounded. This most powerfully proves to the people of the world that imperialism can be defeated. Of course, the American aggressors have shown insincere procrastination in the current Korean armistice negotiations, but as Peng Dehuai, commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, said: "If the other party has no sincerity for peace and deliberately puts forward unreasonable demands, resulting in the failure of the peace talks, then the situation of the war will not be wonderful for the other party."

In short, the determination of the Chinese people to defend Eastern and world peace cannot be shaken in the slightest. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the people. Peace will surely defeat war.

Chinese youth are certainly excited by the victory of the festival, and the encouragement given to Chinese youth by the youth of various countries because of Chinese youth's contribution to peace also makes us very excited, but at the same time makes us feel the importance of the responsibility of the Chinese people and youth, who account for a quarter of the world's population, in the cause of defending world peace. The warmongers, who are enemies of peace, are frantically engaged in an arms race and actively arming West Germany. Recently, they have been constantly increasing the transfer of American troops to West Germany, creating a war atmosphere in Europe. In the East, their conspiracy to arm Japan and attempt to revive Japanese fascism is also being intensified. These conspiracies tell us that the danger of war is still very serious. The efforts of young peace fighters must be stepped up. The people and youth of the world must not allow the revival of German imperialism. And the Chinese people and youth, who fought a bloody battle with Japanese imperialism for eight years, will never recognize any "peace treaty" with Japan that excludes the People's Republic of China, nor will they allow the resurgence of Japanese militarism. The daydream of American imperialism will inevitably suffer a complete and shameful defeat in the face of the peace-loving people.

Chinese youth firmly support the proposal to sign a five-power peace pact and are willing to fight to mobilize more youth to participate in this movement. And this movement is precisely combined with expanding and deepening the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

Chinese youth will always be loyal to the cause of peace, so it was in the past and so it is now, and so it will be in the future.

The unity of Chinese youth is expanding and strengthening. The Chinese New Democratic Youth League has developed to 4.35 million members. Chinese youth are firmly with the youth of the world, under the banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, with the Soviet Lenin and Stalin Communist Youth League as their role model, to strive for the great cause of lasting peace and the bright future of youth, first of all, the cause of peace, to fight to the complete victory.

Long live the unity of the youth of the world!
Long live the World Federation of Democratic Youth!
Long live peace!
Long live the great Stalin, the flag-bearer of world peace!

    在柏林世界民主青年联盟理事会上的报告
    一九五一年八月二十二日
    冯文彬
    编者按：世界民主青年联盟，在第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节闭幕后，于八月二十一日至二十四日在柏林召开理事会，参加与列席的共有九十一个国家二百一十五个青年组织的代表。议程为：讨论第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的成就，青年在加强团结保卫和平斗争中的任务，国际保卫青年权利大会的召开以及批准新会员组织加入世界民主青年联盟等。申请加入的有三十六个新会员组织，分属二十六个国家，其中有十个国家是第一次与世界民主青年联盟发生接触。这些组织经批准加入后，参加世界民主青年联盟的国家增至八十四个，会员在七千二百万以上。出席的各国青年代表，一致肯定了本届联欢节的伟大成就，表示了团结一致保卫和平与制止新的战争危险的决心，并通过了关于联欢节的成就与明年召开国际保卫青年权利大会的决议。出席这次理事会的中国青年代表团由冯文彬、吴晗、荣高棠、区棠亮、赵复三、钱大卫等组成，冯文彬任团长。下面是冯文彬在理事会上的报告。亲爱的朋友们：
    本届理事会是紧接着世界青年与学生第三届和平联欢节而召开的。这次联欢节在世界青年的团结与保卫和平事业上的胜利是空前的。来自一百○四个国家的二万六千多青年，以及德国二百万青年，不管民族、语言、政治、宗教信仰、社会地位的不同，一致强烈地表示了保卫和平的愿望，特别是他们坚决要求立即缔结保证各国人民和平共存的五大国公约，并将动员一切力量展开这一运动，这是对正在积极准备新的世界大战的战争贩子们一个有力的打击和示威。它的影响是极重大的，而且必将因各国青年代表们回国后的传达而更广泛更深入地展开。
    我们中国青年代表团完全同意世界青年联盟主席比林格尔在理事会上所作的报告，同意他对联欢节的估价，以及他报告中所提出的今后工作的方针。中国青年将以一切的努力来扩大与加深联欢节的影响。
    那么，联欢节所给予中国青年的收获是什么呢？
    首先，大大加强了中国青年与全世界青年共同保卫世界和平的决心与信心。联欢节表现了：和平，是不可战胜的力量。和平，能够把一切善良的人民和青年联结在一起，并能够动员最广泛的群众来和和平的敌人斗争。我们在联欢节里，看到了我们为和平斗争的友人遍布于全世界。我们看到了伟大的斯大林所抚育出来的我们的榜样苏联青年们在和平建设中获得巨大的成就，而他们在文化艺术方面的成就，就已经十分有力地显示出社会主义制度将带给人类以何等幸福的生活。我们看到了德国人民和德国青年在皮克总统领导下反对武装西德和争取祖国民主、统一、和平获得了巨大的成绩。我们看到了为反对帝国主义进行着艰苦战斗的朝鲜和越南青年争取民族独立的伟大决心和战斗精神。我们也看到了世界每一角落青年和平战士的斗争正在胜利地发展起来。而我们中国的青年代表们，我们代表团中的青年劳动模范和青年战斗英雄，特别是中国人民志愿军的青年战斗英雄，到处受到各国爱好和平的青年朋友们的欢迎与热爱。
    我们和世界各国青年朋友在柏林进行了多次热情的联欢。在这种为和平而团结的高度国际主义精神下，使我们深深地感到：我们是处在为保卫和平而斗争的强大的行列之中，而这个行列在联欢节之后将日益变得更加广泛和更加强大起来。
    其次，联欢节在各国青年文化艺术的交流上起了重要的推动作用。中国青年的文化艺术节目，获得了参加联欢节的青年的欢迎。今后新中国的青年文化艺术者将向着为和平、民主与人民解放斗争、为劳动人民服务的思想性与艺术性相结合的方向更加努力前进。
    同时，中国青年在联欢节里，热情而诚恳地把自己热爱和平，并愿为和平贡献出一切力量的决心和信心，告诉了全世界青年和平战士。中国人民和中国青年是热爱和平的，我们多年来的解放斗争正是为了实现一个和平建设美好将来的社会条件。我们在毛泽东和中国共产党领导下，在各国人民特别是苏联人民帮助下取得了胜利，在中华人民共和国成立以来，为了增强并巩固保卫和平的力量，我们的生产建设成绩是显著的，举例来说，在工业建设方面，我们大部分工业生产已恢复到抗日战争以前的水平（而抗日战争以来的十四年中国都是处在战争的环境中），钢铁和纺织工业还超过了原来的水平。新的工厂正在兴建，新的铁道正在开辟。全国青年工人和成年工人一道，在爱国主义旗帜下掀起热烈的生产运动，例如大连的青年团员刘立富生产小组，今年初每月平均完成任务百分之二百八十以上，三个月完成了八个月的生产任务。去年仅东北区创造新纪录的青年工人即有一万七千一百十三人。我们的农业生产，因为已有近三亿人口土地改革的完成，使农民每年已经增多了七百五十万吨粮食的收入。农民的生产积极性的大大提高，使得农业生产获得显著发展。我们的棉花生产超过了抗日战争前的水平，粮食不仅停止了多年来需要进口的情况，而且可以输出。新中国水利工程规模的巨大，超过历史上任何时期，今年仅仅治理淮河曾动员二百二十万人同时兴工。教育的发展是极显著的，一百二十五万工人进入业余学校，二千五百万农民进入冬学。以东北为例，中学生的数目即比反动统治时期增加百分之一百七十二点五，小学生的增加更是极为迅速。全国小学生已达三千七百多万。我们和平建设的美好远景是十分光辉灿烂的。
    但是我们为和平建设的渴望却为美国侵略者所不甘心，蓄意破坏世界和平的美国侵略者走着日本帝国主义者的老路，首先侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并把侵略战争从朝鲜引向中国的边境，他们直接侵略我们的台湾，他们横蛮无理地扫射轰炸我们的人民，这样，东方和世界的和平就面临着被美国战争贩子破坏的危险。有着和帝国主义长期斗争经验的中国人民和中国青年，深知和平不能靠哀求和等待而获得，和平必须靠争取，因此，中国人民为了保卫东方和世界和平不致遭到破坏，就肩负起保卫和平最重大的任务——我们被迫组织志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩抵抗美帝国主义的侵略。而从朝鲜战争开始的第一天起，我们中国人民和中国青年就主张和平解决朝鲜问题，正在这同一时期，中国人民和青年就有三亿四千三百八十万人签名要求签订五强和平公约，参加和平游行的群众达到二亿以上。运动的目标要求达到全国人民对抗美援朝“家喻户晓”。正因为中国青年懂得支援朝鲜就是保卫我们的家乡和祖国，就是保卫东方和平与世界和平；正因为我们为保卫和平而斗争的正义性，在抗美援朝的前线上，志愿军中无数青年表现了最高度的英雄主义和自我牺牲精神。而事实已经证明，貌似强大的美帝国主义者，在中朝人民的抗击下，在我们消灭其有生力量而不计较城池得失的正确战略下，伤亡了二十万以上的美国士兵。这就最有力地在全世界人民面前证明了帝国主义是可以被打败的。固然美国侵略者在目前的朝鲜停战谈判中，表现了无诚意的拖滞，但正如中国人民志愿军总司令彭德怀说的：“如果对方并没有和平诚意，故意提出无理要求，致使和谈失败，那么，战争的形势对于对方就不会是美妙的。”
    总之，中国人民保卫东方与世界和平的决心是丝毫不能动摇的。我们坚决相信，胜利是一定属于人民的。和平一定能够战胜战争。
    中国青年固然因为联欢节的胜利而兴奋，而各国青年因中国青年对和平的贡献而给予中国青年以很大的鼓励，这也使得我们十分兴奋，但同时也使我们更感到占世界人口四分之一的中国人民和青年在保卫世界和平事业中责任的重大。以和平为敌的战争贩子们疯狂地进行军备竞赛，积极地进行武装西德，最近不断增调美国军队到西德，制造欧洲的战争气氛。在东方，他们武装日本企图使日本法西斯复活的阴谋活动，也在加紧进行中。这些阴谋活动告诉我们：战争的危险依然十分严重。青年和平战士的努力必须更形加紧。全世界人民和青年，决不能容许德国帝国主义的复活。而曾经和日本帝国主义血战八年的中国人民和青年，决不承认美国排除中华人民共和国之外的任何对日的“和约”，也决不容许日本军国主义的再起。美帝国主义的迷梦在和平人民的面前必将遭到彻底的可耻的失败。
    中国青年坚决支持签订五强和平公约的提议，并愿为动员更广大青年参加这一运动而斗争。而这一运动正是和扩大深入抗美援朝运动相结合着的。
    中国青年永远忠实于和平事业，过去和现在如此，将来也是这样。
    中国青年的团结正在日益扩大加强，中国新民主主义青年团已经发展到四百三十五万团员。中国青年坚决和全世界青年在一起，在世界民主青年联盟旗帜下，以苏联列宁、斯大林共产主义青年团作为自己的榜样，为争取持久和平与青年美好将来的伟大事业，首先是和平事业而奋斗到彻底胜利。
    全世界青年团结万岁！
    世界民主青年联盟万岁！
    和平万岁！
    世界和平旗手伟大的斯大林万岁！
