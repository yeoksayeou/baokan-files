Xinhua News Agency, 4th: People in major and medium-sized cities across the country warmly celebrate the sixth anniversary of the Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan and resolutely oppose the United States' unilateral peace treaty with Japan.

On September 3rd, memorial meetings were held in Shanghai, Chongqing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Zhangjiakou, Guihua, Baotou, Lanzhou, Yan'an, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Qingdao, Hefei, Changsha, Changde, Chengdu, Luzhou, Kunming, and other cities. Many cities' people commemorated the Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan with the practical action of increasing production and making donations. On "September 3rd," people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Baotou City paid donations totaling 1 billion yuan, completing half of the city's semi-annual donation plan. Dalian port workers, who had long been exploited by the Japanese invaders, spontaneously launched a production increase campaign at the beginning of July to welcome "September 3rd" and have now donated all of their extra income from the past two months, totaling more than 200 million yuan. Workers in factories and industries in Chengdu City paid off half of the "Chengdu Worker" aircraft donation before "September 3rd." After discussing the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations, farmers in Chengdu, Huayang, Guanghan, and other counties actively reviewed and revised their patriotic production increase plans.

At the "September 3rd" memorial meetings in many cities, representatives from all walks of life indignantly condemned the crimes of American and Japanese imperialism. In Luzhou, the Southern Sichuan District Political Consultative Committee published the "Investigation Report on the Atrocities of Japanese and American Imperialism in Southern Sichuan During the War Against Japan." People's representatives who had personally suffered from imperialist poisoning made accusations at the meeting, denouncing the shameless acts of American imperialism in unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan. Representatives from all walks of life in Chengde City sadly and angrily condemned the heinous crimes of the Japanese invaders in creating a "no-man's land" of 175,000 square miles in Rehe and western Liaoning. At the "September 3rd" rally in Ningbo City, which had been the target of plague bacteria dropped by Japanese warplanes, Qian Guifa, a winemaker who had contracted the plague that year, indignantly condemned the crimes of the Japanese invaders in massacring the Chinese people.

Some cities launched extensive publicity campaigns. The Guangzhou Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association began a publicity week on "Opposing the United States' Separate Peace Treaty with Japan" on September 4th. Publicity personnel throughout the city, some government cadres, and teachers and students on vacation have formed a publicity team of nearly 4,000 people to carry out planned publicity throughout the city. More than 100 municipal-level propagandists in Qingdao City made reports to the people of the city focusing on "Resolutely Opposing the United States' Separate Peace Treaty with Japan."

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: People in various parts of Northeast China warmly celebrate the "September 3rd" Victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the sixth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Northeast China.

On the 3rd, people in Shenyang, Harbin, Lushun-Dalian, Jilin, Qiqihar, Chengde, and other cities offered flowers and paid their respects to the Soviet Army Memorial Tower and the graves of Soviet martyrs, and swept the martyrs' cemeteries. Grand commemorative meetings were held everywhere. On the 3rd and 4th, the People's Governments and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations of major cities held Sino-Soviet people's get-togethers and receptions for Soviet friends. More than 1,500 people attended the memorial meeting in Shenyang, including the leaders of the Northeast People's Government, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and various democratic parties and people's organizations, combat heroes, labor models, and representatives from all walks of life. Safonov, the acting consul general of the Soviet Consulate General in Shenyang, was also invited to attend. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, pointed out in his speech that the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan was the result of the long-term struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and the dispatch of troops to Northeast China by the Soviet Army. However, American imperialism excludes our country from participating in the signing of the peace treaty with Japan and disregards the interests of the Soviet Union and Asian countries fighting against Japan, which is intolerable to all righteous people in the world. He said: The heroic people of Northeast China must implement the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and fight to the end to defeat American imperialism.

    在许多城市的“九三”纪念会上，各界人民代表激愤地控诉美、日帝国主义的罪行。在泸州，川南区政治协商委员会公布了“对日作战期间日、美帝国主义在川南暴行调查报告”，曾亲自遭受帝国主义毒害的人民代表在会上进行了控诉，痛斥美帝国主义片面对日媾和及重新武装日本的无耻行径。承德市各界代表悲愤控诉日寇曾在热河和辽西制造十七万五千方里的“无人区”的滔天罪行。在曾被日寇飞机撒放过鼠疫细菌的宁波市纪念“九三”集会上，当年曾染鼠疫的酿酒工人钱贵发激愤地控诉了日寇残杀中国人民的罪行。
    有些城市展开了广泛的宣传活动。广州市抗美援朝分会于九月四日开始举行“反对美国单独对日媾和”的宣传周，全市的宣传员、一部分机关干部及在假期中的教师、学生已组成了近四千人的宣传队伍，有计划地在全市进行宣传。青岛市一百多名市级宣传员分头以“坚决反对美国单独对日媾和”为内容向全市人民作报告。
