Beijing Central People's Hospital Achieves Results with New Encephalitis Treatment
Central Ministry of Health Notifies All Regions to Trial

[Reported by this newspaper] Beijing Central People's Hospital, in the process of treating epidemic encephalitis, has achieved good results by trialing the use of adult plasma or whole blood through intramuscular injection. It has been found that there is no specific treatment for epidemic encephalitis, resulting in a high mortality rate for the disease; last year, the mortality rate for patients in the Northeast and North China regions reached over 36%.

This year, among the 44 cases admitted to the Central People's Hospital within 40 days, 27 people did not receive plasma treatment, and 15 died; of the other 17 people who received plasma treatment, only one died. The treatment effect is quite good.

The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government believes that this treatment method is worth promoting and trialing, and urgently notified relevant departments in all regions on September 1st to trial it.

    北京中央人民医院试用脑炎新疗法见效
    中央卫生部通报各地试用
    【本报讯】北京中央人民医院在收治流行性脑炎的过程中，试用成人血浆或全血行肌肉注射治疗，效果良好。查流行性脑炎尚无特效疗法，因之该病的死亡率较高；去年东北区与华北区的患者死亡率达百分之三十六以上。
    今年中央人民医院在四十天内收治的四十四个病例中，有二十七人未用血浆治疗，死亡十五人；另十七人用血浆治疗，只死亡一人。治疗效果相当好。
    中央人民政府卫生部认为这种疗法有推广试用的必要，已于九月一日紧急通报各地有关部门试用。
