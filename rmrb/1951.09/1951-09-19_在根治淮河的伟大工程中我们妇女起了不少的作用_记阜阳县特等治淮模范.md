    In the Great Project of Radically Curing the Huai River, Our Women Played a Significant Role
    —A Record of Li Xiling, a Special-Class Huai River Control Model from Fuyang County
    Kang Cuilan's Talk
    When the Huai River control project started this spring, the laborers in my township (Zhao Ji Township, Huiliu District, Fuyang County) all organized their tools and prepared to go to the embankment. The director of our township's farmers' association saw that the spring project was a dredging project, more arduous than the dike repair in winter last year. To take care of the women's health, he decided not to let women go to the embankment. I felt very sad when I heard this news. Ever since the Kuomintang reactionaries breached the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou, our area has been flooded year after year. We survived only on pumpkins and sweet potato leaves. My family's situation was even worse. My grandmother was beaten to death by the landlord. My sister was dragged away by the reactionaries to repair the dike when she was fourteen years old, and her legs were so swollen that she couldn't wear cotton pants. Thinking of the past, I gritted my teeth with hatred. Now the Communist Party has come, and the poor have turned over. For the sake of the people living a good life, Chairman Mao is determined to control the Huai River. Controlling the Huai River is everyone's responsibility. I am a member of the Communist Youth League and in good health, so I must go to the embankment no matter what. I encouraged several young women members of the League and several strong young women to resolutely request to participate in the Huai River control. We expressed: "Women have turned over, and should participate in work the same as men. We will not come back until we complete the task!" The township head agreed to our request.
    Women played a significant role in the river works. Once the construction site froze over, and everyone was afraid to jump into the water. I thought, if I don't go down, the task won't be completed. So I took the lead and jumped in. The laborers in my township followed me into the water. It also motivated the laborers from other townships. Our women were very united with the men, and also helped the men wash clothes and dry quilts. Everyone's morale was very high. No one said they were tired, and everyone was determined to control the Huai River well.
    This May, at the county-wide commendation meeting, I was named a special-class Huai River control model, and the higher authorities awarded me a large yellow ox. I led the ox home,
    and along the way the masses said: "Chairman Mao is so good! In the past, women couldn't leave the house, but now women are the same as men. And being a model comes with a big yellow ox!"
    The scourge left by the Kuomintang reactionaries has now begun to be defeated by us. This year's harvest is the best in many years. Kang Zhuo's family in my township has six mu of land, four of which have not seen crops for years, but this year they have had a bumper harvest. He said: "Controlling the Huai River is so good, I will work harder even if it's more tiring." The crops in Kang Qichao's family have also grown to waist height. My family's eight mu of wheat, even in the best years, could only yield two shi, but this year it yielded three shi three dou six. The poor peasant Kang Qizhi's family has four people and originally only had two rooms, but after the bumper harvest, they built another kitchen room. The poor peasant Zhou Dengrong had six mu of land, and four mu used to be flooded every year, but this year not only was it not flooded, but he also had two bumper harvests. He said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to control the Huai River, bringing us happy days. I will guarantee increased production and donate airplanes and artillery." He has already donated his family's silver earrings.
    I have now joined the land reform work team. I must stand firm, resolutely fight the landlords to the end, and do a good job in land reform.

    在根治淮河的伟大工程中我们妇女起了不少的作用
    ——记阜阳县特等治淮模范
    康翠兰的谈话
    今年春季治淮工程开始时俺乡（阜阳县洄溜区赵集乡）民工都整理了工具，准备上堤。俺乡农会主任看到春季工程是疏浚工程，比去年冬天修堤艰苦，为了照顾妇女身体，决定不让妇女上堤。我听到这个消息，十分难过。自从国民党反动派扒开花园口黄河堤，俺们这地方连年受淹。只靠南瓜、红薯叶度命。俺家光景更惨。俺奶奶是被地主打死的。俺姐姐十四岁被反动派拉去修堤，腿被打肿了，穿不上棉裤。想起过去的事，恨得我咬牙。如今共产党来了，穷人翻了身。为了老百姓过好日子，毛主席下决心要把淮河治好。治淮是人人有责的。我是个青年团员，身体又好，无论如何也得上堤。我就鼓动了几个女青年团员和几个年青力壮的妇女，坚决要求参加治淮。俺们表示：“妇女翻了身，应该和男的一样参加工作，俺们不完成任务就不回来！”乡长答应了俺们的请求。
    在河工上，妇女是起了不小作用的。有一次工地上了冻，大家都不敢跳下水去。我一想，不下去完不成任务。我就带头跳了下去。俺乡民工都跟着下了水。也带动了其他乡的民工。俺们妇女和男的团结得非常好，还帮助男人洗衣服，晒被子，大家情绪都很高，谁都不说累，一心要治好淮河。
    今年五月，在全县评功大会上，我被评为特等治淮模范，上级奖给我一头大黄牛。我牵着牛回家，
    一路上群众都说：“毛主席真好呀！从前妇女出不了门，现在妇女和男的一样了。当了模范还得了一条大黄牛！”
    国民党反动派留下的祸根，如今被我们开始战胜了。今年的丰收是多少年来都没有的。俺乡康灼家六亩地，有四亩地年年不见庄稼，今年丰收了。他说：“治淮真好，再累点也要干。”康其朝家的庄稼也长到齐腰深了。俺家八亩麦子，往年再好也只能打二石多，今年却打了三石三斗六。贫农康其志家有四口人，原来只有二间房子，丰收以后，又盖了一间锅灶房。贫农周登荣六亩地，以前每年都要淹掉四亩，今年不但没淹，而且获得两季丰收。他说：“共产党、毛主席领导俺们治淮河，给俺们带来了欢乐日子，我要保证增产，捐献飞机大炮。”他已把他家的银耳坠捐献了出来。
    我现在已参加土地改革工作队了。我一定要站稳立场，坚决与地主斗争到底，把土地改革搞好。
