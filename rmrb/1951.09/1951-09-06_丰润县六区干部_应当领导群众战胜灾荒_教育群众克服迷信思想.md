To the Editor:
　　In early August, the villages of Shaliuhe, Zhangzhuangzi, Dougezhuang, and Xiaoliuzhuang in the Sixth District of Fengrun County, Hebei Province, suffered from drought and lack of rain. The villagers, following old superstitious methods, gathered in groups, beating drums and gongs to "pray for rain." Zhangzhuangzi and Dougezhuang "prayed for rain" for several days. Shaliuhe is the location of the district people's government, but the district leaders did not educate the masses about this, and instead all left under the pretext of going to work in the countryside. Xiaoliuzhuang "prayed for rain" on one day, and coincidentally it rained that night. Therefore, starting from August 19th, they performed operas for four days, reportedly spending more than one million yuan in Renminbi.

　　I believe that the local county and district leading organs turned a blind eye to the superstitious behavior of the masses and adopted a laissez-faire attitude, which is very wrong. In particular, the responsible comrades of the Sixth District People's Government avoided this matter under the pretext of going to work in the countryside, which is an even more irresponsible performance. The government has long put forward the slogan of "not relying on heaven for food" and "digging more wells to prevent drought," but the local leading organs have not organized the masses well to overcome natural disasters, but have allowed the development of superstitious and backward ideas. Especially when the opera was performed in Xiaoliuzhuang, the local leading cadres still did not care. This not only wasted the people's money, but more importantly, it expanded the propaganda of superstition, and its impact is very bad. Therefore, I hope that the local county and district leading organs will pay attention to this issue and review the past mistakes.

### 丰润县六区干部  应当领导群众战胜灾荒  教育群众克服迷信思想

    丰润县六区干部
    应当领导群众战胜灾荒  教育群众克服迷信思想编辑同志：
    河北省丰润县六区沙流河、张庄子、豆各庄、小刘庄等村八月上旬天旱缺雨。村民们照过去迷信的办法成群结队、锣鼓喧天地“求雨”。张庄子、豆各庄“求雨”好几天。沙流河是区人民政府所在地，区里领导干部对此竟不向群众进行教育，反而以下乡工作为名都走了。小刘庄当天“求雨”，晚上碰巧下雨了，因此由八月十九日开始唱戏四天，据说要花人民币一百余万元。
    我认为，当地县区领导机关对群众的迷信行为熟视无睹，采取了置之不理的态度，是非常不对的。尤其第六区人民政府负责同志以下乡工作为名来避开这件事，更是不负责任的表现。政府早就提出“不靠天吃饭”，“多打井防旱灾”的口号，但当地领导机关没有很好组织群众，战胜天灾，却容许了迷信落后思想的发展。尤其在小刘庄唱戏时，当地领导干部还是不闻不问。这不但浪费了人民的金钱，更重要的是扩大了迷信的宣传，其影响是很坏的。因此，我希望当地县区领导机关重视这个问题，并对过去的错误做法进行检讨。
