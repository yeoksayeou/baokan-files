Cultural Life Brief Review

    Newspapers Should Pay Attention to Criticizing the Tendency of Political Liberalism
    The rural art troupe led by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Culture and Education has a tendency to detach itself from politics and does not sing the song "Oppose the Armed Forces of Japan," which the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression calls on everyone to sing. They believe that this song has no artistic value. After this fact was revealed by Quan Wen, a reader of the Shanxi Daily, the newspaper organized a discussion on the issue. In the first week of the discussion, fifty letters were received from readers. These letters all criticized the rural art troupe's view that the song "Oppose the Armed Forces of Japan" had no artistic value and should not be sung, arguing that it was a manifestation of a lack of political enthusiasm, a neglect of the Chinese people's most urgent political task, a tendency to detach from the struggle and seek abstract "artistic value," and a failure to deeply understand the principle that art serves politics. When criticizing the erroneous thinking of the rural art troupe, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' Art Troupe, the Military and Political Art Troupe, and other art groups also examined their own purely technical viewpoints. For example, some people admired Zhao Dan's acting skills in the film "The Life of Wu Xun," believing that: "Although the political content is not good, the performance techniques should still be learned." This shows that some people still have many confused ideas about the relationship between politics and art. With everyone's help, the rural art troupe made a self-criticism. They realized that their mistake was serious liberalism and political and ideological paralysis, as well as an error in artistic thinking. The rural art troupe's mistake of detaching itself from politics deserves the attention and vigilance of every art group.
    
    A Correct View of Entertainment Should Be Established
    New China's films and dramas are not merely entertainment products, but tools for educating the people. Theater audiences must change their old, incorrect artistic appreciation tastes and establish new, correct entertainment views. However, according to readers' letters, some theater audiences are still using their outdated tastes to appreciate the people's new art, often applauding and cheering regardless of the plot. For example, when the Pingju opera "Little Son-in-Law" was performed, the love between the young couple Tian Xi and Xiang Cao in the play was opposed by their families and satirized by backward masses, and some audience members cheered. When the film "New Sons and Daughters of China" was screened, a group of Japanese devils went to surround the village where Hei Lao Cai lived, and some audience members momentarily felt it was lively and applauded. Some people even applauded and laughed at certain tragic scenes in the plays and films. These phenomena indicate, on the one hand, that some audiences in theaters still have incorrect entertainment views such as seeking amusement and watching the excitement, and on the other hand, that some audiences lack political and cultural literacy and public morality, resulting in chaos in the theater order. This phenomenon should attract the attention of the audience and the cinemas and theaters. Cinemas and theaters can also make full use of slides, loudspeakers, wooden signs, and other tools to educate the audience, so that this type of phenomenon does not happen again.

    文化生活简评
    报纸要注意批评政治上自由主义的倾向
    山西省人民政府文教厅领导的乡村文艺工作队，存在着脱离政治的倾向，不唱中国抗美援朝总会号召大家唱的“反对武装日本”歌曲。认为这首歌曲没有艺术上的价值。这一事实经山西日报读者全温揭发后，该报即组织了对这一问题的讨论。在开始讨论的第一个星期中，就收到五十封读者的信。这些信都批评乡村文艺工作队认为“反对武装日本”歌曲没有艺术价值而不唱的观点，是没有政治热情的表现，是对中国人民最迫切的政治任务的忽视，是一种脱离斗争寻找抽象的“艺术价值”的倾向；同时也是没有深刻认识艺术服务于政治的这一原则的表现。该省总工会文工团、军政文工团等文艺团体在批判乡村文艺工作队这一错误思想时，也检查了自己的单纯技术观点。譬如有的人崇拜电影“武训传”中赵丹的演技，认为：“政治内容虽然不好，表演的技术还是应该学习的。”这说明有些人对政治与艺术的关系，还存在许多糊涂观念。乡村文艺工作队经过大家的帮助，作了检讨。认识到自己的错误是严重的自由主义，和政治思想上的麻痹，也是文艺思想上的错误。乡村文艺工作队这一脱离政治的错误，值得每一个文艺工作团体重视和警惕。
    应该建立正确的娱乐观点
    新中国的电影、戏剧不是单纯的娱乐品，而是教育人民的工具。影剧院的观众必须改变旧的不正确的艺术欣赏趣味，建立新的正确的娱乐观点。但是，据读者来信反映，影剧院有些观众还在用自己陈旧的趣味欣赏人民的新艺术，他们常常不顾剧情，随意叫好鼓掌。像演评剧“小女婿”时，剧中青年男女田喜和香草的恋爱受到了家庭的反对，受到了落后群众的讽刺，有些观众就叫了好。放映影片“新儿女英雄传”时，一群日本鬼子去包围黑老蔡所住的村庄，有些观众一时感到热闹，也就鼓掌。甚至有人对剧影的某些悲惨场面，也鼓掌发笑。这些现象一方面说明了影剧院的一部分观众还存在着消遣、看热闹等不正确的娱乐观点，一方面也说明了某些观众政治和文化水平的低下与公共道德的缺乏，以致造成剧场秩序的混乱。这种现象应该引起观众们和电影院、剧场方面的注意。各电影院、剧场也可充分利用幻灯片、广播筒、木牌等工具对观众进行教育，使这类现象不要一再发生。
