    China National Department Store East China Branch Prepares Supplies for Autumn
    Mobile Teams Deliver Goods to Rural Areas
    The East China Branch of the state-owned China National Department Store has prepared supplies for the people of the entire region for the coming autumn. To adapt to the greatly increased purchasing power of farmers following this year's agricultural production increase, the company implemented its procurement plan for the third and fourth quarters ahead of schedule in the second quarter of this year, and appropriately expanded the procurement and sales plans for the third and fourth quarters. As a result, the company's procurement volume in the second quarter of this year was equivalent to 70 percent of the total procurement volume for the second, third, and fourth quarters of last year. The planned procurement volume for the third and fourth quarters of this year is nearly double the total procurement volume for the first half of the year, and more than three times the total procurement volume for the same period last year. The planned sales volume has also increased by more than 100% compared with the first half of the year and by more than 200% compared with the same period last year.

    In order to ensure timely supply, the China National Department Store East China Branch and state-owned cotton yarn and cloth, native produce, silk, petroleum, industrial equipment, and other companies, as well as cooperatives, have generally established supply relationships, signed supply and sales or consignment agreements, and systematically and purposefully encouraged the East China region's department store industry to increase production. By mid-August, the China National Department Store East China Branch had signed ordering and exclusive sales contracts with 319 private manufacturers and joint organizations (including nine joint organizations with more than 1,000 factories), with the payment for goods accounting for about a quarter of the company's total procurement payment.

    The number of supply agencies added by department stores in various parts of East China in the third quarter will increase by about a quarter compared to the original plan. Forty-nine new warehouses and business premises have been built. The supply of goods in economic crop areas has been strengthened. For example, state-owned trading companies in the cotton-producing areas of northern Jiangsu Province have organized twenty teams to go to the countryside to promote the sale of department store goods during the farmers' patriotic cotton sales and storage campaign. Most of the more than twenty new business units established in the area before September 10 were also located in cotton-producing areas.

    The China National Department Store East China Branch has now accelerated the transfer of various goods to the sales areas and has begun supplying them. Many local department store mobile teams have even adopted the method of delivering goods to customers' doorsteps to reduce the difficulty for farmers to purchase goods during the busy farming season.

    中国百货公司华东区公司备妥秋后供应物资
    流动小组把货物送到农村
    国营中国百货公司华东区公司秋后供应全区人民的物资已经准备就绪。为了适应今年农业增产后农民购买力大大提高的情况，该公司今年第二季度就已将第三、四季度的进货计划提前实施，并把第三、四季度的进货和销货计划适当扩大。这样，该公司今年第二季度的采购额就相等于去年第二、三、四三季总采购额的百分之七十。今年第三、四季度进货计划数比上半年进货总数增加近二倍，比去年同期进货总数增加三倍多。销货计划数也比上半年增加一倍多，比去年同期增加两倍多。
    为了保证及时供应，中国百货公司华东区公司和国营花纱布、土产、蚕丝、石油、工业器材等公司与合作社普遍建立了供应关系，订立了供销或代销协议，并且有计划、有重点地鼓励华东区百货业增产。到八月中旬止，中国百货公司华东区公司已和三百十九家私营厂商及联营组织（内九个联营组织有一千多家工厂）订立了订货和包销合约，货款占该公司总采购款额四分之一左右。
    华东区各地百货公司第三季度增设的供应机构将比原定计划增加四分之一左右。新建仓库、营业场所达四十九处。经济作物区的物资供应机构已经加强。例如，国营贸易公司在苏北产棉区农民爱国售棉储棉运动中，就已组织了二十个小组，下乡推销百货。该区九月十日以前新建的二十多个营业单位，也大部设置在产棉区。
    中国百货公司华东区公司现已将各项货品加速调运销地，开始供应。不少地方百货公司流动小组更采取送货上门的推销办法，减少了农忙中农民购货的困难。
