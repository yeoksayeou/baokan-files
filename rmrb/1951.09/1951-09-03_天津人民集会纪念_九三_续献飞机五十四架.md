Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 2nd: More than two thousand representatives from all walks of life in Tianjin held a "September 3rd" Commemoration Meeting for the 6th Anniversary of the Victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan today. Huang Huoqing, Deputy Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, recounted at the meeting the heroic resistance of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan with the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to the Northeast. He pointed out that the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan is an attempt to openly and "legally" carry out the conspiracy of arming Japan. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this action by American imperialism. Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, reported on the donation campaign in Tianjin. He pointed out that all sectors of Tianjin have already paid a total of 58 billion yuan in cash for weapon donations. In order to respond with practical actions to the provocative behavior of American imperialism in disrupting the Kaesong negotiations, representatives from all sectors have agreed, after consultation, to continue donating 54 airplanes on the principle of increasing production, improving management, and increasing income, bringing the total to 100 airplanes, including the 46 already pledged.
