Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th – The San Francisco Conference and the American-dictated "peace treaty" with Japan were the subjects of unanimous commentary in all major newspapers here yesterday. “Red Right Daily” wrote: It is hard to believe that the San Francisco Conference ever seriously discussed such an extremely important question as achieving peace – the question of a peace treaty with Japan. In fact, the San Francisco Conference was a farce staged by the United States and Britain. It once again abused the voting machine of the United States' vassal states. It was a farce for signing a "treaty" that has nothing to do with achieving peace in the Far East, and shamelessly and openly prepares for a new war in the Far East.

The newspaper further said: The Soviet delegation, supported by the Czechoslovak and Polish delegations, was in fact not only the spokesperson for the vast majority of the people of the Far East, but also the spokesperson for peace-loving people all over the world. The weakness of American imperialism has been exposed at the conference. Why did the United States, which organized the "conference," need to so barbarously suppress the principles of international law and the conventions of holding such a conference? Why did they have to refuse to discuss the proposals of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland? Why did they have to declare that the conference was not for discussion but only for signing as soon as they learned that the Soviet representative was going to San Francisco? All this shows that the American and British imperialists know very well that no one will support their criminal plans, not only ordinary people, but also many bourgeois governments refuse these plans. They had to take those barbaric measures because if they followed normal procedures, it would be clear how isolated their criminal plans in the Far East were.

“Labor Daily” emphasized that the American scheme for an aggressive treaty has been rejected by the majority of mankind. Those forty-nine countries that obediently voted in favor of the treaty must not only be responsible to their own people, but also bear a great responsibility to all mankind.

“People’s Daily” pointed out: It is a unilateral order harmful to the Japanese people. Its purpose is to oppose the people of Asian countries and oppose the Soviet Union. Its purpose is to form an axis of West Germany, Washington, and Tokyo, which the imperialists are manufacturing in the fascist style.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague News: The Czechoslovak Peace Committee passed a resolution at its meeting on September 12, protesting against the so-called peace treaty with Japan signed at the San Francisco Conference, and sent a telegram to the Japanese Peace Protection Committee to express its support.

The protest to Acheson said: "The Czechoslovak Peace Committee firmly opposes the American-made 'treaty' because it is not a peace treaty but a treaty preparing for a new war, which directly violates the basic agreement concluded by the Allied countries in the war against Germany and Japan. This is a conspiracy to suppress all efforts to strive for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact."

The protest also pointed out: "The initiators and signatories of this so-called treaty trampled on the inalienable right of the people of Asian countries to decide their own destiny, especially the inalienable right of the Chinese people who played the most important role in the fight against Japanese aggression. The fact that India and Burma did not attend the signing clearly shows the illegal nature and invalidity of this so-called treaty. The Soviet Union's refusal to sign this treaty is a manifestation of the condemnation of the separate peace treaty with Japan by all honest and peace-loving people in the world."

In a telegram to the Japanese Peace Protection Committee, the Czechoslovak Peace Committee guaranteed its support for the Japanese people's struggle to defend peace, and said: "We sympathetically watch the arduous struggle waged by your country's peace-loving people against the American occupation forces and their Japanese traitorous running dogs. We warmly congratulate your people on the heroic determination shown in collecting five million signatures in the country against the shameful American 'treaty'."

### 捷各大报纸斥责旧金山会议非法  揭露美制对日和约是准备新战争的条约  捷保卫和平委员会声援日本人民保卫和平的斗争

    捷各大报纸斥责旧金山会议非法
    揭露美制对日和约是准备新战争的条约
    捷保卫和平委员会声援日本人民保卫和平的斗争
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】旧金山会议与美国授意的对日“和约”为此间所有的大报昨天一致评论的题目。“红色权利报”写道：很难相信，旧金山会议曾认真地讨论过这样极其重要的关于获致和平的问题——对日和约问题。事实上，旧金山会议是一出美英的滑稽剧。它又一次地滥用了美国仆从国家的投票机器。它是一个为了签订一个与获致远东和平毫不相干的，无耻地、公开地准备远东新战争的“和约”的滑稽剧。
    该报进一步说：受到捷克斯洛伐克与波兰代表团所支持的苏联代表团，事实上不仅是绝大多数远东人民的发言人，而且是全世界爱好和平人民的发言人。美帝国主义的弱点在会议上已暴露无遗。为什么组织“会议”的美国需要这样野蛮地压制国际法的原则和举行这种会议的惯例呢？为什么他们不得不拒绝讨论苏联、捷克斯洛伐克与波兰的提案呢？为什么他们一得知苏联代表将去旧金山就不得不声称会议不是讨论，而只是签字呢？所有这些都表明：美英帝国主义者很了解，没有一个人会支持他们的罪恶计划的，不仅是一般人民，而且还有许多资产阶级政府都拒绝这些计划。他们之所以必须采取那些野蛮的措施，是因为如果按照正常的办法，就可以看出他们在远东的罪恶计划是多么的孤立。
    “劳动报”强调说：美国图谋侵略的和约受到了大多数人类的拒绝。那些驯顺地投票赞成和约的四十九个国家，不仅要对他们自己的人民负责，而且要对全人类负重大的责任。
    “人民报”指出：它是一种对日本人民有害的单方命令。其目的在于反对亚洲各国人民，反对苏联。它的目的在于结成帝国主义者正在仿照法西斯型式制造的西德、华盛顿与东京的轴心。
    【新华社讯】布拉格消息：捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会在九月十二日的会议上通过决议，抗议在旧金山会议上所签订的所谓对日和约，并致电日本拥护和平委员会表示声援。
    向艾奇逊提出的抗议说：“捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会坚决反对美制‘和约’，因为那不是和平条约而是准备新战争的条约，这直接违反盟国在对德、日作战中所缔订的基本协定。这是妄想压制争取缔结五大国和平公约的一切努力的阴谋。”
    抗议又指出：“这一所谓和约的发起者与签字者，践踏了亚洲各国人民决定他们自己命运的不可让与的权利，特别是在反对日本侵略的战斗中起了最重要作用的中国人民的不可让与的权利。印度与缅甸都未出席签字，这清楚地表明了这个所谓条约的非法性质和没有效力。苏联拒绝在这个条约上签字，这是全世界所有正直和爱好和平的人民都谴责单独对日和约的表现。”
    捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会在致日本拥护和平委员会的电文中，保证支持日本人民保卫和平的斗争，并说：“我们同情地注视着贵国爱好和平的人民对美国占领军和他们的日本卖国走狗所进行的艰难斗争。我们热烈地祝贺贵国人民在国内征集了五百万人的签名反对可耻的美国‘条约’所表现的英勇的决心。”
