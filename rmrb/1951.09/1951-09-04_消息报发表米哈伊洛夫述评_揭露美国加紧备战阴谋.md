Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 3rd: TASS, Moscow, September 1st - In his international commentary published in "Izvestia," commentator Mikhailov analyzed the "strategy" of the U.S. ruling clique, stating that while the U.S. government talks glibly of peace, it is, in fact, intensifying war hysteria and accelerating preparations for another war. The U.S. government's only response to the Soviet government's peace initiatives and the demands of people in various countries for the conclusion of a peace pact is to further worsen relations with the Soviet Union, further incite propaganda against the Soviet Union and against the peace-loving People's Republic of China, and encourage calls for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

Mikhailov pointed out that the essence of the "strategy" of the U.S. ruling clique is to reject all opportunities for a peaceful settlement of international problems, to obtain more dollars for the arms expansion movement, and to take other aggressive measures under the cover of completely unbelievable "defense" and unwarranted "danger." It is because of this "strategy" that the U.S. ruling clique rejected the proposal to conclude a peace pact, sabotaged the Paris Four-Power talks, and provocatively created various obstacles to the Kaesong talks for resolving the Korean conflict, etc.

Mikhailov continued: World newspapers correctly pointed out that the main reason why the U.S. government believes it is necessary to maintain an artificial state of tension at home and in international relations is to pass huge military plans and another tax increase bill before Congress adjourns in the fall. When Marshall spoke before the Congressional budget committee, he attacked the mood for peace that had arisen among the American people after the start of the Kaesong armistice talks. His primary consideration was, of course, the impact this sentiment might have on the amount of military appropriations. It is no coincidence that shortly after Marshall's visit to the Far East, General Ridgway's troops began to coordinate with the Kaesong talks by taking some provocative actions. Facts have proven that the U.S. ruling clique is not concerned about the smooth progress of the Kaesong talks when plans for further arms expansion are submitted to the U.S. Congress. They attempted to obstruct the Korean armistice talks, even at the cost of bombing the Kaesong neutral zone.

Their plan also stipulated that the situation in Korea should be worsened; otherwise, the U.S. position on the separate peace treaty with Japan would be even more unstable, and it would be more difficult to force Britain, France, and other countries, especially Pacific countries, to sign this treaty.

Mikhailov concluded by saying: The "strategy" of the U.S. ruling clique relies on artificial means such as war hysteria, hypocrisy, and lies. People in various countries who yearn for peace believe that the policy of the U.S. ruling clique is a policy of preparing for war and undermining international cooperation.

    消息报发表米哈伊洛夫述评
    揭露美国加紧备战阴谋
   【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：“消息报”评论家米哈伊洛夫在他所写的国际述评中，分析美国统治集团的“战略”说：美国政府侈谈和平，事实上却在加紧制造战争歇斯底里和加速另一次战争的准备。美国政府对于苏联政府的和平倡议与各国人民希望缔结和平公约的要求的唯一答复，是进一步恶化与苏联的关系，进一步煽动反对苏联、反对爱好和平的中华人民共和国的宣传，鼓励要求侵略苏联与人民民主国家的叫嚣。
    米哈伊洛夫指出：美国统治集团的“战略”的要旨是拒绝和平解决国际问题的一切机会，为扩张军备运动取得更多的美元，用完全没有人相信的“防御”、莫须有的“危险”的说法作掩护来采取其他的侵略措施。正是由于这个“战略”，美国统治集团拒绝了缔结和平公约的建议，破坏了巴黎四国代表的谈判，对解决朝鲜冲突的开城谈判挑衅地制造出各种各样的障碍等等。
    米哈伊洛夫继续说：世界报纸正确地指出，美国政府之所以认为必须在国内以及在国际关系上保持人为的紧张状态，主要是为了要国会在秋季休会以前通过庞大的军事计划和另一次增税的法案。马歇尔在国会讨论预算的委员会上发言时攻击美国人民在开城停战谈判开始后所产生的和平的情绪。他首先考虑的当然是这种情绪对于军事拨款数目可能造成的影响。在马歇尔访问远东后不久，李奇微将军的军队便开始以一些挑衅行动来配合开城谈判，这绝不是偶然的事。事实证明，在进一步扩军的计划提交美国国会的时候，美国统治集团是不关心开城谈判的顺利进展的。他们企图阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，甚至不惜采取轰炸开城中立区这种办法。
    他们的计划中也规定要恶化朝鲜的局势，否则，美国在单独对日和约问题上的地位将更不稳固，并且更难迫使英、法以及其他国家、特别是太平洋国家签订这个和约。
    米哈伊洛夫结语称：美国统治集团的“战略”依靠的是战争歇斯底里、虚伪、说谎这一类人为的办法。渴望和平的各国老百姓认为美国统治集团的政策是准备战争和破坏国际合作的政策。
