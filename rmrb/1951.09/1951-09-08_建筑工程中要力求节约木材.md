The Government Administration Council's "Directive on Saving Wood" issued on August 13th clearly pointed out the current situation of wood supply falling short of demand, requiring the entire country to practice strict economy in the logging and use of wood to prevent waste. The directive specifically stipulates: wood shall be uniformly planned and allocated by the state, with the Financial and Economic Committee of the People's Government at all levels responsible for controlling and strictly reviewing, prohibiting state-owned enterprises, institutions, and troops from logging wood and engaging in the buying and selling of wood; wood-using departments should adhere to the principle of economy, strive for economic rationality, use wood sparingly, reduce wood usage, and seek substitutes; and designate the People's Governments at all levels, relevant departments, and supervisory organs to conduct regular inspections, commend and reward those who have achieved results in saving wood, and punish those who violate the Government Administration Council's instructions and waste wood.

The wood problem has now become one of the important issues in the country, and earnestly saving wood is a matter of great urgency. The construction industry is a major consumer of wood. Therefore, how to practice strict economy and eliminate waste has become an urgent task for those engaged in the construction industry.

The Important Issue is to Practice Strict Economy

China's wood resources are very inadequate, with forests covering only five percent of the country's area. In order to control and transform nature, eliminate disasters, and at the same time ensure the supply for construction needs, it is necessary to vigorously carry out afforestation work in a guided and step-by-step manner. However, as the saying goes, "it takes ten years to grow a tree," and new trees cannot take effect immediately to meet construction needs. Therefore, the important issue at present is to practice strict economy.

In 1951, the Northeast region undertook about two-thirds of the national wood production task. According to the proportion of production and distribution in the Northeast, the wood needed for construction accounts for about four-tenths of the region's total wood production task. It can be seen that the amount of wood required for construction projects is very large. Wood is needed in almost every aspect of construction. To build a new China, we must first engage in basic construction projects. After the land reform, in order to meet the needs of the working people and exchange goods between urban and rural areas, it is necessary to carry out construction projects in transportation, water conservancy, storage and transportation, and local industrial construction in many aspects, and the demand for wood is increasing rapidly; but at present we are facing the difficulty of wood shortage. Therefore, it is very necessary and very urgent to practice strict economy in wood in construction projects.

Inspect Engineering Construction Plans and Designs

To practice strict economy and prevent waste, we must start with inspection and eliminate the root causes of waste from concrete facts. Engineering construction is carried out according to plans and design drawings, so we should start by inspecting plans and design drawings first. The engineering construction plan of each unit should be strictly reviewed by the Financial and Economic Committee of the People's Government at all levels. If the source of wood is not available, if too much wood is needed and cannot be supplied, it should not be approved; if not so much wood is needed and falsely reported and over-claimed, it should not be allowed. Construction design drawings should be checked by the construction engineering authority. The amount of wood required should be reduced to the lowest standard. The part of the construction design drawing that uses wood can be divided into two categories: structural and decorative. The structural part is the structure that is necessary to carry the building in construction. From this point of view, it seems that there are not many problems; in fact, it is still possible to save in many cases. The question is what standard we use to calculate the stress. Undoubtedly, the vast majority of designers currently base their standards on those of American and British capitalist countries. Then we need to check whether this specification is suitable for our current situation, so as to find out whether there is waste. At the same time, we must ideologically recognize: in the case that the workers' class consciousness has been improved, and they are engaged in construction work with a responsible attitude to the people, whether the safety rate that was specially increased in advance because of fear of not being serious enough during construction should be appropriately reduced. On the other hand, many of the standards of the United States and Britain are created by capitalists with the pursuit of commercial profits as the starting point, and these standards should be re-evaluated at present. Some of our designers still stipulate in the construction instructions that "the wood must be dry and free of knots, and the four sides and corners must be square." Many of our cadres mechanically carry out tasks according to these dogmas, resulting in waste. Some designers parrot foreign standards. As a result, they only recognize "foreign pine" as "standard" wood, and only recognize foreign pine as qualified wood for all wood in the construction part.

There are also many things worth studying in the decorative part of the building when measured by the principle of saving. For example, the size of the door and window frames does not necessarily have to follow the American and British standards, the accessories on the doors and windows can be saved or replaced with other materials, the wooden decorations of the patterns can be canceled... If we can seriously check, accumulate small amounts into large amounts, the wood saved will also be considerable.

Therefore, getting rid of capitalist influence in architectural design and quickly stipulating our own specifications and norms is one of the important prerequisites for saving wood.

Eliminate the Phenomenon of Wasting Wood in Construction

Construction is the work of completing products by using actual materials according to drawings. Saving in construction is a real saving. Good management in the construction site can effectively achieve results. Common waste phenomena in general workshops include: 1. Wood is piled up and handled carelessly, causing damage. 2. The distribution of materials does not meet the needs, using large materials for small purposes, and using long materials for short purposes. 3. Sawing materials is not carefully planned, picking them up at will and sawing them off arbitrarily, resulting in large waste and a lot of waste materials. 4. Burning usable wood as firewood. 5. Scaffolding materials (i.e., wood used to build scaffolding during construction), formwork (used for pouring cement), etc. are not carefully sorted out after use, and are arbitrarily demolished, increasing waste materials, etc.

In the workshop, the cherishing of wood materials should be treated the same as the cherishing of hardware materials, and the work of distributing wood materials should be treated the same as the work of distributing steel bars. It is worthwhile to spend a little more labor to sort out wood materials and use wood materials. And it should be stipulated the limit of wood consumption, strictly assessed, and the amount of materials used should be limited to the lowest standard.

Study Substitutes and Improve Usage Technology

Saving the use of wood in construction is an important task, but to solve the problem more comprehensively, it is also necessary to study substitutes and improve the usage technology to further solve the basic difficulty of our country's lack of wood.

Among the substitutes, bamboo is a material worth studying and promoting. For example, using bamboo to weave walls and ceilings, using bamboo frame structures for simple houses, using bamboo as scaffolding material, and using bamboo materials for some interior decoration. Larger sheds and factories can also consider using bamboo materials to meet their required performance. The East China People's Revolutionary University in Suzhou built an auditorium that can accommodate 3,000 people with bamboo, spending only 200 million yuan, which is a good example. Bitter bamboo can grow to a height of ten meters in more than a month and can be planted in large quantities. In the future, we should organize and carry out investigations, research and promotion work in this area.

In some cases, cement can replace wood. Prestressed concrete beams [Note 1] are more economical than wooden beams in some cases. Concrete piles can be considered instead of wooden piles. A certain motor factory designed by the East China Construction Engineering Company needs to drive about 3,000 foundation piles. After in-depth research, it was changed to drive cement piles. It can not only achieve better results, but also save 7% of the cost. This is a good example worthy of attention.

There are many aspects to consider to improve the technology of use. For example: 1. Concrete formwork is usually consumed after being reused two or three times. In the future, we should consider polishing the board surface and adding paint when necessary to reduce losses. 2. For larger concrete structure factories, if there are multiple identical roof trusses, we should consider prefabricating the roof truss formwork on the ground and then lifting it with a crane, which can not only save formwork and a large number of scaffolding materials, but also shorten the construction time. 3. The use of ring connection [Note 2] design in wood structure design is an important development for saving wood, and our country should conduct in-depth research and promotion and application. 4. The remaining materials in the construction should be carefully selected and used, which can also save a lot of wood consumption. 5. Collecting the short materials from the project and handing them over to the mechanized door and window factory to make materials for batch manufacturing of doors and windows is an excellent way to utilize waste. There are many ways to save wood. The above are just a few of them.

Relying on the Masses is an Important Link

Our country's current wood supply cannot meet the needs of construction, so saving wood has become a serious struggle task for us at present. To complete this task, it cannot be achieved simply by administrative orders. From small household firewood to railway sleepers, pit wood, and batch wood for construction, the contact surface is very broad. Therefore, we must rely on the masses, establish an ideological understanding of resolutely fighting for saving wood on the basis of the masses' conscious patriotism, organize and act together to fight against the phenomenon of wasting wood resources, and then can we complete the task. We must conscientiously study and resolutely implement the Government Administration Council's instructions on saving wood. All units that use a large amount of wood should be responsible for convening meetings and conducting reviews according to the instructions; specific resolutions should be made on the issue of saving wood in the future. Trade unions in construction enterprises should also pay close attention to conducting publicity and education for cadres and workers, improve their understanding of this serious issue, mobilize them to put forward more rationalization proposals, and incorporate saving and rationally using wood into patriotic covenants, so that saving wood becomes a mass work. Technical experts in various regions should give full play to their skills, research and create methods for saving wood, and put forward suggestions.

In order to overcome the current difficulty of wood supply falling short of demand, and in order to make the country's construction work progress more smoothly, we must mobilize the power of the broad masses to carry out this work.

[Note 1] Prestressed concrete beam - The biggest shortcoming of ordinary concrete is that it cannot withstand large tensile forces. The prestressed concrete beam is designed to consider the magnitude of the tensile force that the beam will bear in advance before the design, and then a certain number and specifications of steel wire ropes are placed in the beam model, and mechanically tensioned to a certain degree, and then concrete slurry is poured into the model. After a considerable period of time, the steel wire rope is loosened to become "prestressed concrete." This concrete has greater elasticity and can withstand loads without cracking.
[Note 2] Ring connection - The connection point of the wood structure is to embed a steel ring between the joint surfaces of two pieces of wood and penetrate them with small-diameter bolts, which is called "ring connection." Using this to replace the grooving and screw connection methods used in the past can reduce the loss of wood, and can maximize the bearing capacity of the wood, and can also use several small-sized pieces of wood instead of one large piece of material.

    建筑工程中要力求节约木材
    华东工业部华东建筑工程公司经理  夏行时
    政务院八月十三日发布“关于节约木材的指示”，明确地指出了目前木材供不应求的状况，要求全国对木材的采伐和使用厉行节约，防止浪费。指示中具体规定了：木材由国家来统一计划调拨，各级人民政府财政经济委员会负责掌握，严格审查，禁止各公营企业、机关、部队采伐木材和经营买卖木材；使用木材部门应本节约原则，力求经济合理，缓用，少用和找寻代用品；并指定各级人民政府各主管部门和监察机关经常进行检查，对节用木材有成绩者予以表扬奖励，对违反政务院指示，浪费木材者予以惩处。
    木材问题现在已成为全国的重要问题之一，认真节约木材已是刻不容缓的事。建筑工程是使用木材的大主顾。因此，如何厉行节约，消除浪费，已成为从事建筑业者当前的一个紧急的斗争任务。
    重要的问题在于厉行节约
    我国木材资源是很不充足的，森林面积只占全国面积的百分之五。为了控制和改造自然，消灭灾害，同时为了保证供应建设需要，就必须有领导有步骤地大力进行护林造林工作。但正如俗语所说的“十年树木”，新植树木以应建设需要，不是顷刻可以生效的。所以，目前的重要问题就在于厉行节约。
    一九五一年东北区担任全国木材生产任务约三分之二。根据东北生产分配的比重，供应建筑上需要的木材约占该区木材生产总任务的十分之四。可见建筑工程上需用的木材，数量是十分巨大的。建筑上几乎无一处不需要木材。建设新中国，首先要从事基本建设工程。土地改革以后，为了满足劳动人民的需要，交流城乡物资，就需要在交通、水利、储运以及地方工业建设上多方面地进行建筑工程，木材的需要量更迅速增加；而目前我们却面临着木材缺乏的困难。因此，在建筑工程中对于木材厉行节约，是十分必要的、十分迫切的。
    检查工程建筑计划和设计
    要厉行节约，防止浪费，须从检查着手，从具体事实上杜绝浪费的根源。工程建筑是根据计划和设计图样进行的，因此首先应从检查计划和设计图样开始。各单位工程建筑计划应由各级人民政府财政经济委员会负责严格审查，如果木材来源无着落，如果需用木材太多无法供应，就不应该批准；如果不需要那么多木材而虚报多领，就更不能容许。建筑设计图样应由建筑工程主管部门检查。把需用木材的数量，切实核减到最低标准。建筑设计图上使用木材部分可分为结构性的和装修性的两类。结构性的是承载建筑物在构造上必需的结构。从这一点上观察，似乎问题不多；事实上，在许多情形下也仍然是可以节省的。问题在于我们计算应力依据什么标准。无疑的，目前绝大多数的设计师是以美英资本主义国家的标准为依据的。那末就要检查一下这种规格是否适合于我们目前的情况，从而发现有无浪费。与此同时，必须从思想上认识：在工人阶级觉悟已经提高，他们用对人民负责的态度来从事建筑工作的情况下，是否应适当地减低事先恐怕施工时不够认真而特别加大的安全率。另一方面，英美的许多标准是资本家以追求商业利润为出发点而制造的，这些标准在目前应予以重新评价。我们有些设计人员在施工说明书中，仍然规定有“木料必须干燥无节疤，四边楞角必须方正”等字样。我们不少干部，就机械地根据这些教条执行任务，以致造成浪费。有些设计师生吞活剥地搬用外国标准。于是只认定“洋松”是合乎“标准”的木材，只认得洋松是建筑部分一切木料的合格木材。
    建筑的装修部分用节约的原则来衡量也有许多值得研究的地方。例如：门窗框子的尺寸不一定要照英美标准，门窗上的附件可以省用或改用其他材料，花描的木装饰可以取消……。如能认真检查，积小数成大数，所节省的木料也很可观。
    因此，在建筑设计上摆脱资本主义影响，从速规定我们自己的规格和规范，是节约木材的重要前提之一。
    消灭施工中的浪费木材现象
    施工是根据图样运用实际材料完成产品的工作。施工上的节约是实实在在的节约。施工工场上管理得好就能切实收到效果。一般常见的工场上浪费现象有：1、木料堆置和搬运不经心，造成损坏。2、配料不合需要，大材小用，长材短用。3、锯料不精打细算，随手拣到，任意锯断，浪费大，废料多。4、把可用的木料当柴烧。5、脚手料（即施工时搭架子所用的木料）、壳子板（灌洋灰用）等用后不细加整理，任意拆毁，增多废料等。
    工场上要把珍惜木料和珍惜五金材料同样看待，要把配木料工作和配钢筋工作同样处理。宁可稍多用些人工整理木料、利用木料，也是值得的。并且应当规定木料耗用限度，严加考核，限制用料至最低标准。
    钻研代用品和提高使用技术
    建筑上节省木料使用是件重要工作，但要比较全面地解决问题，还需要研究代用品和提高使用技术，以进一步解决我国缺乏木材的基本困难。
    代用品中竹子是值得钻研与推广的材料。例如：采用竹子编墙及平顶，简单房屋的采用竹架结构，采用竹作鹰架（即施工时搭的架子）材料，部分室内装修采用竹料等。较大的棚厂，也可以适合其需要性能，考虑改用竹料。苏州的华东人民革命大学用竹子盖了一座可容三千人的大会堂，只花了两亿元，是个很好的例子。苦竹一个多月即可长高十公尺，可以大量栽植。今后应有组织地展开这一方面的调查研究和推广工作。
    在某种情况下水泥是可以代替木材的。预应力混凝土梁〔注一〕在某种情况下较木梁经济。混凝土桩可以考虑代替木桩。华东建筑工程公司设计的某电机厂需要打基桩约三千根。经深入研究后，改打水泥桩。既可得较好的效果，而造价反节省了百分之七。这是值得注意的好例子。
    提高使用技术应考虑的问题方面很多。如：1、混凝土壳子板平常翻用两三次后就损耗完了。今后应考虑把板面刨光，必要时并加涂料，以减少损耗。2、较大混凝土结构的厂房，同式屋架如有多架，就应考虑将屋架壳子置平地预制而后用起重机吊起，非但可节省壳子板及大批鹰架材料，并且可以缩短建筑时间。3、木材结构设计中采用环结合〔注二〕设计，是节省木材的重要发展，我国尤应深入研究和推广应用。4、建筑中剩余材料应精心拣选利用，也能节省不少木材消耗。5、把工程上的短料收集拢来汇交机制门窗工厂作成批制造门窗的材料，是废物利用的极好出路。节约木材的办法是很多的，以上这些，不过是其中的几种。
    依靠群众是重要的环节
    我国目前的木材供应既无法满足建设上的需要，因此，节约木材便成为我们当前的一个严重的斗争任务。要完成这项任务，不是简单地用行政命令的办法就可以达到的。小自家用劈柴，大至枕木、坑木及建筑上的成批用材，接触面非常广。因此，就必须依靠群众，在群众自觉的、爱国主义的基础上，建立坚决为节约木材而奋斗的思想认识，组织起来，行动起来，一致和浪费木材资源的现象进行斗争，才能完成任务。我们必须切实学习并坚决执行政务院关于节约木材的指示。凡使用木材较多的单位，应由各该单位负责人员，根据指示，召开会议，进行检讨；对今后节用木材问题，作出具体决议。建筑企业中的工会，也应切实注意对干部和工人进行宣传教育，提高他们对这一严重问题的认识，发动他们多多提出合理化建议，把节约和合理使用木材订入爱国公约，使节约木材成为群众性的工作。各地区的技术专家们应充分发挥自己的本领，研究创造木材节约的方法，提出建议。
    为了克服目前木材供不应求的困难，为了使国家的建设工作比较顺利地前进，我们要动员广大群众的力量进行这个工作。
    〔注一〕预应力混凝土梁——普通混凝土的最大缺点为不能
            承受较大的拉力。预应力混凝土梁即在设计以前预
            先考虑梁承受拉力的大小，然后在梁模型内，置一
            定数量与规格的钢丝绳，用机械方法紧拉至一定程
            度，然后灌混凝土浆至模型内。待一相当时期后，
            放松钢丝绳，就成为“预应力混凝土”。这混凝土
            具有较大弹性，能承受荷重而不发生裂纹。
    〔注二〕环结合——木结构之结合点，用钢环嵌入两木材结
            合面之间，并贯串以小直径的螺栓，叫做“环结
            合”。用这来代替过去运用的刻槽及螺丝结合方
            法，可使木料减少损失，并可尽量发挥木材的承受
            能力，同时能利用数块小尺寸的木料代替一根大
            料。
