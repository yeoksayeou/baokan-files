Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. The United Nations Command has repeatedly created provocative incidents in the Kaesong neutral zone, deliberately sabotaging the armistice negotiations, but has also categorically denied the facts, attempting to deceive the people of the world. The testimony and material evidence in each provocative incident by the United Nations Command have irrefutably established the serious responsibility of the United Nations Command. The confessions of armed personnel of the United Nations Command recently captured by our side further expose the denials and lies of the United Nations Command.

The spokesman for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation now publishes the following materials based on the confessions of Kim Bong-deuk, a reconnaissance member of the South Korean army under the United Nations Command, and Park Rae-ryang, a member of the South Korean security team, who were captured by our side:

(1) On September 1, our military police personnel captured Kim Bong-deuk, a reconnaissance member of the South Korean army under the United Nations Command, who illegally invaded the neutral zone of Kaesong. According to his confession, Kim Bong-deuk, male, 30 years old, is a reconnaissance member of the South Korean army. He had illegally invaded the Tandong-ri area in the neutral zone four times for reconnaissance work, and directly participated in the action of murdering our military police personnel on August 30. When he illegally invaded the neutral zone for the fifth time, he was captured by our military police in Yangwon-ri. On August 29, Kim Bong-deuk sneaked into Dorasan-ri and learned that three military police personnel from our side were living in the home of Kim Chung-ryu, a resident of Tandong-ri, Cheonggyo-myeon, Kaepung-gun. That night at 9 p.m., he and ten reconnaissance members of the South Korean army, wearing military uniforms and carrying rifles, automatic rifles, and carbines, advanced towards Tandong-ri led by Kim Bong-deuk. They arrived at Tandong-ri at about 4 a.m. on the 30th, and entered Kim Chung-ryu's house at about 6 a.m., kidnapped three of our military police personnel, and murdered two of our military police personnel on the way back outside the neutral zone. One person escaped. Kim Bong-deuk, because it was already dawn, took off his military uniform, put it in a grass bag, and took it back to the reconnaissance team headquarters first.

(2) On September 3, our troops encountered ten members of the Changdan-gun security team from the South Korean side carrying rifles and submachine guns on a high ground near Weondong, northeast of Panmunjom outside the neutral zone. They immediately killed or wounded four of them and captured Park Rae-ryang. Park Rae-ryang carried two member dispatch certificates issued by the Changdan-gun security team in the U.S. military camp. Our troops have transferred Park Rae-ryang to our military police in the neutral zone because his confession involved the invasion of the neutral zone by the South Korean army under the United Nations Command and the murder of our military police personnel. According to his confession, Park Rae-ryang, male, 27 years old, lives in Jangpadong, Geumneung-ri, Changdan-gun, and is a member of the security squad of the South Korean army in Eoryong-ri, Jinseo-myeon, Changdan-gun, and is often active in the Weondong and Eoryong-ri areas. About two weeks before his capture, Park personally heard security team personnel say that the superiors were going to take back the military uniforms because they had fired at the Panmunjom neutral zone. About a week before his capture, Park also personally saw a helicopter land in Gamamdong. At that time, eight members of the South Korean army wearing military uniforms and holding weapons passed through the area from Panmunjom to the east. Two American officers who did not get off the plane, through the Korean interpreter who got off the plane, instructed the eight people, saying: "About a week ago, someone shot at a Chinese Communist army sentry. In the future, when you go inside to operate, you are not allowed to wear military uniforms." The shooting at the "Chinese Communist army sentry" mentioned by the U.S. military obviously refers to the incident of the South Korean army of the United Nations Command murdering our military police personnel on August 19.

According to the confessions of Kim Bong-deuk and Park Rae-ryang, it is once again confirmed that the armed personnel of the South Korean army under the United Nations Command invaded the Kaesong neutral zone and murdered our military police personnel on August 19 and August 30.

    被捕的李承晚匪军人员供认
    美方蓄意谋杀我军事警察
    美方矢口抵赖破坏停战谈判的阴谋完全被揭穿
    【新华社开城七日电】联合国军方面向开城中立区一再制造挑衅事件，蓄意破坏停战谈判，但又矢口抵赖事实，企图欺骗世界人民。每一次联合国军方面挑衅事件中的人证与物证，都已无可争辩地确定了联合国军方面的严重责任。近日我方捕获的联合国军方面武装人员的供词，更进一步地揭穿了联合国军的抵赖与谎言。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团发言人，现就我方所捕获的联合国军所属南朝鲜部队的侦察队员金凤得与南朝鲜治安队队员朴来良两人的供词，发表如下材料：
    （一）九月一日，我方军事警察人员在开城中立区内捕获非法侵入中立区的联合国军所属南朝鲜部队侦察队队员金凤得。根据其口供，该金凤得，男性，三十岁，系南朝鲜部队的侦察队员，前后曾四次侵入中立区内炭洞里地方进行侦察工作，并直接参加了八月三十日谋害我方军事警察人员的行动，当第五次又侵入中立区时，在阳原里地方为我军事警察所捕获。八月二十九日，金凤得曾潜往都罗山里，获悉开城中立区内军事警察人员三人居住在开丰郡青桥面炭洞里的居民金忠儒家中，遂在当晚九时与南朝鲜部队的侦察队员十人，身穿军服，携带步枪，自动步枪和卡宾枪，由金凤得领路向炭洞里前进，至三十日晨四时许到达炭洞里，约在六时左右进入金忠儒家中，绑走了我方军事警察人员三人，并于撤到中立区以外的途中，谋害了我方军事警察二人，另一人逃回。金凤得则因已天明，乃脱下军服，放在草袋中，先行带回侦察队本部。
    （二）九月三日我方部队在中立区外板门店东北远洞附近的高地，遭遇南朝鲜方面带有步枪及冲锋机枪的长湍郡治安队员十名，当即毙伤其四名，并捕获朴来良一名。朴来良带有美军阵地内长湍郡治安队所发给的队员派遣证两张。我方部队以其供词中涉及联合国军南朝鲜部队侵入中立区谋害我军事警察事件，已将朴来良移交中立区内我方军事警察。根据其口供，该朴来良，男性，二十七岁，家住长湍郡金陵里长坡洞，系长湍郡津西面鱼龙里南朝鲜部队的治安小队队员，经常活动于远洞与鱼龙里一带。朴在被捕前约两星期，曾亲自听见治安队人员声称，由于向板门店中立区射击，上级要把军衣收回。朴又在被捕前约一星期，曾亲眼看见直升飞机一架降落于甘岩洞，当时有身穿军服，持有武器的南朝鲜部队人员八人自板门店东行经过该处，未下机的美国军官二人，经由下机的朝鲜译员向该八人训诫说：“约一星期以前有人向中共军哨兵打枪，以后到里边去活动，不准穿军衣。”上述美军所称向“中共军哨兵”打枪事，显然是指八月十九日联合国军南朝鲜部队谋害我军事警察事件。
    根据金凤得与朴来良两人的供词，再度证实了八月十九日与八月三十日侵入开城中立区谋害我军事警察人员的，就是联合国军所属的南朝鲜部队武装人员。
