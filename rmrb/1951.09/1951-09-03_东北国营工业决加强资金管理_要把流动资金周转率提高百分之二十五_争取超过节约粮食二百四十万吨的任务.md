Northeast State-Owned Industry Resolves to Strengthen Capital Management
To Increase the Turnover Rate of Working Capital by 25%
Strive to Exceed the Task of Saving 2.4 Million Tons of Grain

The Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, responding to Chairman Gao Gang's call at the urban work conference, decided to increase the turnover rate of working capital from 1.6 times in 1950 to 2 times, shorten the turnover period by 45 days, and strive to exceed the task of saving 2.4 million tons of grain.

Some Achievements Have Been Made in Capital Management
But the Accumulation of Funds in Most Factories and Mines is Still Serious

In the past, Northeast state-owned industry had already made some achievements and gained some experience in capital management in some factories and mines. The prerequisites for these achievements were: in 1949, preliminary democratic reforms, asset inventory, anti-waste campaigns, new record movements, and quota management work laid the groundwork for economic accounting. In 1950, enterprises successively established independent accounting systems, initially determined working capital, implemented bank settlement and credit systems, promoted production-sales contract systems and procurement contract systems, launched self-sales businesses for various bureaus and companies, and established accounting reporting systems, enabling leading organs to grasp the financial situation of enterprises. Since the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held an industrial conference last August, leading cadres at all levels have gradually paid attention to financial management. However, the basic situation of working capital is still characterized by serious accumulation, excessively long turnover periods, and low efficiency of utilization, which is still not keeping pace with the requirements of the developing situation. The average turnover period in 1950 was 224 days, with an annual turnover of 1.6 times. The basic situation in the first half of this year was similar to last year, with half of the bureaus improving and half of the bureaus experiencing even longer turnover periods.

The reasons for the accumulation of funds are mainly that enterprises do not pay enough attention to working capital management and have not implemented fixed quota management of funds. Working capital plans are inaccurate, impractical, or simply non-existent, resulting in the spontaneous flow of funds management. At the same time, in terms of management methods, some supply system methods still exist, and enterprises have not been fully implemented, resulting in a continuous increase in the accumulation of funds.

Reserve Funds Account for More Than Half of the Total Funds
Product Accumulation Accounts for One-Fifth of the Total Funds

The most serious accumulation is in reserve funds, accounting for 52.7% of the total funds of factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department, which can be used for 172 days. Among them, the average ending balance of materials in the Electricity Bureau in the first quarter is enough for 915 days of use; the Coal Mine Bureau is also enough for 578 days of use. The main reason for the accumulation is the supply system thinking in material management, with the attitude of "preparing more than needed." Many material departments only manage supply and do not have strict management work. For example: there is no reserve quota, and they are not familiar with the inventory situation, resulting in unlimited and blind procurement; there is a lack of technical supply knowledge, resulting in inconsistent specifications or unqualified quality; there is insufficient communication with the planning department, and the supply plan is not changed in time when the production plan changes; or the planned consumption quota is set too high, and the actual consumption cannot be achieved, resulting in accumulation; production and construction are not completely separated, and construction materials are purchased with production funds; unusable materials left over from before liberation have not been disposed of in time, etc.

The second is product accumulation, accounting for 21% of the total funds of factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department, with an average accumulation of 48 days. The average accumulation in the Mechanical Bureau in the first quarter was four and a half months, in the Electrical Engineering Bureau it was 84 days, and in Benxi Coal and Iron Company it was 79 days. Industrial products are basically in short supply, but products are accumulated, which cannot but be attributed to insufficient subjective effort. For example, the quality is not good enough, the price is not appropriate, the combination of production and sales is not sufficient, they are not familiar with market supply and demand, and they have failed to actively and comprehensively organize and carry out sales activities.

In addition, the system of using banks as settlement centers has not been thoroughly implemented among various units, there is still commercial credit, enterprises themselves have too many outstanding accounts, and they are in arrears with the accumulation to be turned over, which has prolonged the turnover period. In terms of production funds, due to unsound production organization and the absence of a strict quota management system, a large amount of funds is also accumulated.

There are Sufficient Conditions for Accelerating Capital Turnover
Subjective Efforts Should Be Strengthened Immediately to Achieve It

The serious phenomenon of capital accumulation in Northeast state-owned industry at present urgently and prominently requires strengthening capital management. At the same time, this work can also be strengthened. Northeast state-owned industry has the conditions for accelerating capital turnover, such as the implementation of independent accounting in factories and mines in 1950 and the determination of funds; industrial products are basically in short supply and sell well; there are certain sources of material supply; the production of general factories and mines has been put on a normal track; there are guidelines, methods and some experience in working capital management; and more importantly, at the urban work conference of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Comrade Gao Gang has given clear instructions on this. Therefore, the core of the problem lies in how to eliminate ideological obstacles, strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses, and take concrete measures to respond to Comrade Gao Gang's call.

To do this work well, we must correct various erroneous ideas that hinder the acceleration of capital turnover. For example, the supply system thinking of "the more material reserves, the better," "prepare more than needed," "product sales are the responsibility of the higher authorities," and "waiting for customers to come to the door," the departmentalism thinking of "it is advantageous to delay turning over accumulation" and "rather be in debt than seek credit," and the simple production task viewpoint of "only caring about production and not financial costs." At the same time, we must do a good job in the turnover plan of working capital and make specific measures for implementing the plan; we must do a good job in the fixed quota of funds and implement management according to the quota; we must thoroughly implement enterprise management and overcome some of the existing supply system methods. Leading cadres at all levels should list accelerating capital turnover as one of the main tasks, and regularly convene meetings of relevant departments such as production, finance, materials, and sales to discuss and improve financial work. What is particularly important is to vigorously publicize the importance of accelerating the turnover of working capital and mobilize the masses of workers to put forward various methods to save national funds and promote the rationalization of production management.

    东北国营工业决加强资金管理
    要把流动资金周转率提高百分之二十五
    争取超过节约粮食二百四十万吨的任务
    东北人民政府工业部响应高岗主席在城市工作会议上的号召，决定将流动资金周转率自一九五○年的一点六次，提高至二次；缩短周转期四十五天；争取超过节约粮食二百四十万吨的任务。
    资金管理工作已有一些成绩
    多数厂矿资金积压仍然严重
    东北国营工业在资金管理工作上过去在部分厂矿已经做出了一些成绩，得到了一些经验。做出这些成绩的先决条件是：一九四九年，经过初步的民主改革、清理资产、反浪费、新纪录运动及定额管理工作，为经济核算制准备了条件。一九五○年中，各企业先后建立了独立会计制，初步确定了流动资金，实行了银行结算与信贷制度；推行了产销合同制与采购合同制，展开了各局公司的自销业务；并建立了会计表报制度，使领导机关能够掌握企业的财务状况。去年八月中共中央东北局工业会议之后，各级领导干部对财务管理工作已逐渐重视。但是，流动资金的基本状况仍是积压现象严重，周转期过长，运用效率低，还赶不上形势发展的要求。一九五○年的平均周转期为二百二十四天，全年周转一点六次。今年上半年的基本状况与去年相近似，其中半数的局有了好转，半数的局周转日期反而更加拖长。
    资金积压的原因，主要是各企业对流动资金管理重视不够，没有实行资金定额管理；流动资金计划不准确，不实际，或者根本没有计划，因而资金管理工作形成自流。同时，在管理方法上，还存在着若干供给制的办法，未能完全实行企业化，因而形成了资金积压的不断增加。
    储备资金占资金总额一半以上
    产品积压占资金总额五分之一
    积压现象最严重的是储备资金，占东北工业部所属各厂矿资金总额百分之五十二点七，可供一百七十二天的耗用。其中电业局第一季材料平均结存金额，够九百十五天用；煤矿局也够五百七十八天用。积压的主要原因是在材料管理工作中有供给制思想，宽打窄用。许多材料部门只管供应，没有严格的管理工作。例如：没有储备定额，又不熟知库存状况，以致无限量地盲目采购；缺乏技术供应的知识，以致规格不符，或质量不合；与计划部门联系不够，生产计划变更时，未及时变更供应计划；或计划消耗定额作大了，实际消耗不了，造成积压现象；生产与修建未澈底分清，以生产资金采购修建材料；解放前残留下的不能用的材料，未及时处理等。
    其次是产品积压，占东北工业部所属各厂矿资金总额百分之二十一，平均积压达四十八天。机械局第一季平均积压四个半月，电工局为八十四天，本溪煤铁公司为七十九天。工业产品基本不足，产品却积压起来，不能不归咎于主观努力不够。例如质量不够好，价格不适当，产销结合不够，不熟知市场供求情况，未能积极并多方面地组织与开展推销业务等。
    此外，各单位之间未能澈底执行以银行为结算中心的制度，仍有商业信用，企业本身悬账太多，并拖欠上缴积累，以致延长了周转期。生产资金方面，由于生产组织不健全，没有严格的定额管理制度，也大量积压着资金。
    加速资金周转已有充分条件
    应即加强主观努力争取实现
    东北国营工业目前资金积压的严重现象，迫切地、突出地要求加强资金管理工作。同时，这个工作，也是可能加强的。东北国营工业已具备了加速资金周转的条件，例如一九五○年各厂矿都实行了独立会计，确定了资金；工业产品基本上是供不应求，销路很好；材料供应已有一定来源；一般厂矿的生产已走上正常的轨道；流动资金管理上已有了方针、办法和若干经验；更重要的是在中共中央东北局城市工作会议上，高岗同志对此已作了明确的指示。因此，问题的中心就在于如何排除思想障碍，加强领导，动员群众，采取具体措施来响应高岗同志的号召。
    要把这个工作做好，必须纠正各种阻碍加速资金周转的错误思想。例如“材料储备越多越好”“宽打窄用”“产品推销是上级的事情”“坐候顾客上门”的供给制思想，“多拖欠上缴积累是占了便宜”“宁欠债务，不使信贷”的本位主义思想，以及“只管生产，不问财务成本”的单纯生产任务观点。同时，必须做好流动资金的周转计划，并作出执行计划的具体措施；必须做好资金定额，根据定额实行管理；必须澈底贯彻企业化，克服目前存在的某些供给制办法。各级领导干部应将加速资金周转列为主要工作之一，定期召集生产、财务、材料、推销等有关部门会议，讨论与改进财务工作。特别重要的是应大力宣传加速流动资金周转的重要意义，发动职工群众提出各种办法，以节约国家资金，促进生产管理的合理化。（东北工业部办公室）
