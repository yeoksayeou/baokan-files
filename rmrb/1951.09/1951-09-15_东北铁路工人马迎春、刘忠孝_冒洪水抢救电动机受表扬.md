    Northeast Railway Workers Ma Yingchun and Liu Zhongxiao
    Commended for Rescuing Electric Motors from Flood

Editor:
    During the period of the mountain floods in Kaiyuan and Tieling, Liaoxi Province, Northeast China, the people and railway workers in the affected areas organized rescue teams, using selfless spirit to protect and repair the people's railways. In this heroic struggle, many model deeds emerged, and the story of Ma Yingchun and Liu Zhongxiao rescuing electric motors is one such example.

    On the evening of August 15th, the Liao River breached its banks, and floodwaters flowed towards Tieling. At the railway water supply station in Tieling, there were two electric motors, one of 110 horsepower and one of 75 horsepower. These were valuable pieces of equipment for the railway bureau, and if these two electric motors were soaked in water, it would affect repair work. When the floodwaters approached the water supply station, the head driver of the water supply station, Comrade Ma Yingchun, and the driver Liu Zhongxiao, erected a crane to lift the electric motors and pumped the water seeping into the machine room. As a result of their intense and continuous work, they finally overcame the flood and protected these two electric motors.

    Comrades Ma Yingchun and Liu Zhongxiao, wholeheartedly protecting the electric motors, forgot to take care of their own families. As a result, their houses were destroyed, and their bedding, grain, and furniture were all washed away by the flood. They suffered personal losses, but looking at the rescued electric motors, they felt indescribable joy.

    The personnel from the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways who inspected the flood damage site learned about the deeds of Comrades Ma Yingchun and Liu Zhongxiao in rescuing the electric motors. They personally went to express their condolences, awarded them each 500,000 yuan as a bonus, and notified the responsible unit to compensate them for the personal losses they suffered as a result of rescuing the electric motors.

    东北铁路工人马迎春、刘忠孝
    冒洪水抢救电动机受表扬编辑同志：
    东北辽西省开原、铁岭山洪爆发期间，受灾区铁路沿线人民及铁路职工，曾组织了抢修队，以忘我的精神保卫与修复人民的铁路。在这一英勇的斗争中，曾出现了很多的模范事迹，马迎春、刘忠孝抢救电动机的事，就是其中的一例。
    八月十五日晚上，辽河决口，洪水向铁岭方向横流过来，驻在铁岭的铁路给水所里有着一百一十马力及七十五马力的电动机两架，这是铁路局的贵重器材，如果这两部电动机被水浸湿了，将要影响修理工作。给水所的司机长马迎春同志当洪水流近给水所的时候，和司机刘忠孝，一面架起吊车，将电动机架起来，一面将渗进机房的水抽出去，他们紧张地持续地工作的结果，终于战胜了洪水，保护了这两架电动机。
    马迎春和刘忠孝两同志，一心为了保护电动机而忘记了去照顾自己的家庭，因此他们家里的房子被冲坏了，被服、粮食、家具也全被水冲走了。他们私人受到了损失，但是他们看着被拯救出来的电动机，心里却有着说不出的高兴。
    铁道部东北特派员办事处视察水害现场的人员知道了马迎春、刘忠孝两同志抢救电动机的事迹，亲自去作了慰问，发给他们每人五十万元奖金，并通知主管单位负责赔偿他们两人因抢救电动机所受到的私人损失。
