Our Party has always attached importance to propaganda work and ideological and political work. The Chinese revolution, from "a single spark" to nationwide victory, is the development process of the widespread dissemination of Marxist-Leninist theory combined with the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, and the development process of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese revolution. This thought is the guiding ideology of the Chinese Communist Party and the pointer of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement.

In the Northwest region, in the past year, we have done a lot of work: we have completed land reform in an area with a population of seven million, launched the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries in the entire Northwest region, launched the production movement and other democratic construction work. One movement followed another, and every place, whether urban or rural, has undergone one or several heated mass movements. In these movements, party organizations at all levels have carried out large-scale mass propaganda work on current affairs, politics, and policies. In cadre education and school education, some propaganda and education work on the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has also been carried out. The broad masses of people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life have been mobilized to participate in the above-mentioned movements, and their political consciousness has been continuously improved in actual struggle. In this way, the ideological and political level of the broad masses of the people has been unprecedentedly improved. The people's political enthusiasm has begun to manifest itself in all work: workers are actively engaged in production, launching the Ma Hengchang group competition movement; farmers are enthusiastically joining the army and paying public grain; young students are enthusiastically taking up national defense posts, and two mobilizations to apply for military cadre schools have exceeded the planned targets; the industrial and commercial sectors are actively paying taxes; the religious circles have launched a reform movement against imperialist cultural aggression; and ethnic minorities in border areas have also participated in the great patriotic movement. This year, on May 1st, more than 17.7 million people in the entire Northwest participated in patriotic demonstrations and signed their names to support the conclusion of a peace pact and voted against arming Japan; among them were more than 4 million women. Since the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea issued the three major appeals, the upsurge of promoting patriotic pacts, donating airplanes and cannons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has been surging forward. With the enthusiastic support of the people, the work of the people's governments at all levels has been carried out very smoothly. This proves that once Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are combined with revolutionary practice and grasped by the people, they will become an endless material force that continues to grow and develop, driving the revolutionary cause forward.

The high tide of the political consciousness of the people has also educated all cadres and party members. In various works, the style of coercion and command has been greatly reduced. Everyone has gradually realized from actual tests that the method of political persuasion is the only correct and most effective working method for the Party to lead the masses of the people. The ideological and political level of the entire Party has been improved, and the work style has made great progress.

The Party's propaganda and education cause has also greatly developed recently. In terms of scale and scope, it has surpassed any period in the history of the Party in the Northwest region. Now, there are already more than 1,800 speakers, more than 12,000 propagandists, plus a large number of non-Party activists who have emerged in various movements, and the propaganda team formed by them is already a propaganda army of hundreds of thousands of people. This is a political force that regularly plays a role among the masses of the people and is a very valuable asset of the people themselves. During this period, we also began to learn how to organize and lead various propaganda forces and how to use radio, newspapers, and various literary and artistic activities to carry out propaganda work. In particular, various localities have created many new working methods in the mass struggle, and the experience is very rich. Various accusation meetings, reasoned struggle meetings, recollection meetings, and exhibitions are all very effective ways to enlighten the masses' ideological awareness with living people and real events. Going through various representative meetings, activist meetings, discussion meetings, and family meetings, combined with specific situations, explaining policies, arranging tasks, and commending model examples are the best methods to promote various works. Radio stations, reading groups, blackboard newspapers, and propaganda boards are good ways to regularly conduct current affairs and political propaganda to the masses. In ethnic minority areas, newspapers and periodicals in local ethnic languages ​​have been published, and a method combining trade teams and health teams has been adopted to make propaganda penetrate into nomadic areas. These facts all show that the Party's propaganda and education work has been greatly advanced.

However, this does not mean that our propaganda work on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has all been done very well and that there are no problems. No, there are still problems, and there are many very serious problems. Generally speaking, all our work now has propaganda, but much of the propaganda work is not done well, we are not good at conducting propaganda targeting the main ideological problems of the masses, and we are not good at making the propaganda of all specific work have the necessary ideological and political content. This is the main reason for the generalization and lack of depth of propaganda work. For example, in propaganda on selling cotton and storing cotton, we are not good at linking the personal interests of farmers with the overall interests of the country, and we cannot make farmers fully understand the great significance of selling cotton and storing cotton for supplying raw materials for the cotton textile industry, ensuring clothing for the military and civilians across the country, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidating national defense. Other works, such as the propaganda on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the propaganda on developing the production movement, and the propaganda on land reform, all have the same problems. This is the general trend in current mass propaganda work. In addition, some of our places and some of our works still ignore propaganda and have a commandist style. Our leadership over secondary and higher education and national education is very insufficient; in particular, the education of the vast number of cadres on the job is still very lax; we do not pay attention to studying theory and seriously studying the central government's policies, and we do not pay attention to summarizing work, and the tendency of empiricism is universal. Even the rich experience in propaganda and education work in recent times has not been seriously summarized. This has distanced the work of our Party's propaganda departments from the practice of the broad masses, and made the propaganda activities in the entire region unable to advance smoothly due to the lack of good guidance. Even in many departments and among the leading backbone of many places, an emotion of only caring about specific business and not asking about politics has grown. In their view, ideological and political work is only something that a few people in the Party's propaganda departments have to do, and others can ignore it. In the work they preside over, the principle is not high and the political atmosphere is weak. The purely technical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie and the vulgar liberalist style are invading the Party, and have already caused significant losses to many works. Aren't these all facts? Aren't these all very serious problems? These are all the results of the fact that the Party committees in various places still do not pay enough attention to the propaganda work of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and do not provide enough guidance and help to the comrades working in the propaganda departments.

The above is the basic situation of the Party's propaganda and education work in the Northwest region. When discussing the future propaganda and education work in the Northwest, we must never abandon these actual situations, but must closely combine these actual situations, conscientiously summarize the experience of propaganda and education work in this region, understand the current working environment and conditions, improve from the existing level, and move forward on the existing basis. This time, the Northwest Regional Propaganda Work Conference should do well in accordance with this spirit. The propaganda work conferences of various provinces and cities should also do in accordance with this spirit.

In the Northwest region, in recent times, what are the basic tasks of the Party's propaganda and education work, the basic tasks of the Party on the ideological front? It is: centering on continuing to deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries, continuing to carry out the land reform movement, carrying out the production movement, carrying out the religious reform movement and continuing to consolidate national unity, continuing to educate the entire people on patriotism and internationalism, education on class struggle, education on developing production, criticizing various erroneous thoughts that are not conducive to the people's democratic cause, and continuing to improve the ideological and political level of the entire Party, so as to mobilize the entire people to fight for the realization of the above-mentioned major tasks. All the above-mentioned work we want to do has ideological and political content. The tendency of empiricism that abandons or reduces ideological and political work and blindly carries out practical work must be corrected with great efforts; but we must also oppose the practice of carrying out empty ideological and political work away from various practical work.

The most important objects of our Party's propaganda and education work are still workers and farmers. We must effectively improve the propaganda and education work for the working class and farmers, so as to achieve the goal of improving the working class, leading the farmers forward, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The main part of the working class in the Northwest region is in the new areas, and has lived under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time. Although we have done some propaganda and education work for them after liberation, it is still far from enough. Various ideological influences of the reactionaries still exist among the workers, especially in many factories and enterprises, the old remaining reactionary forces still exist. In the recent period, we must make up for this lesson of launching the democratic reform movement in these factories and enterprises, so as to eliminate these remaining reactionary forces and eliminate the ideological influence of the reactionaries. In the future, with the development of economic construction, the ranks of the working class will inevitably have great development, and a large number of farmers, urban poor, and petty-bourgeois elements will enter the ranks of the working class. Our Party is the vanguard of the working class. We must conduct systematic education on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to all workers, so that the working class can have a high degree of political consciousness and better shoulder the responsibility of leading national construction. The farmers in the Northwest region live in different areas - there are old areas, new areas where land reform has been completed, new areas where land reform has not been carried out, and ethnic minority areas, and the situation is extremely complex. In the next two or three years, we must lead the farmers to resolutely complete land reform in all areas where land reform has not been carried out. However, we are now building a new democratic society, and in the future we will develop towards a socialist society and a communist society. Therefore, it is far from enough to only lead the farmers to complete land reform. In particular, with the completion of land reform and the development of economic construction, capitalist economic components will inevitably develop in both urban and rural areas, and the capitalist thoughts of the farmers will also develop accordingly. We must carry out political education for the farmers without stopping for a moment, so that the farmers trust the leadership of the working class, trust the worker-peasant alliance, and in various practical actions, support the specific policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government, gradually understand the bright and splendid prospects of agricultural socialization, and guide the farmers to continue to move on the correct path. These all require long-term arduous work.

The most important issue is to mobilize the entire Party to do propaganda work. No matter what work is done, it is necessary to conduct propaganda to the people, and to make the propaganda of various specific work have the necessary ideological and political content. Not only the propaganda department, organization department, united front work department and other departments of the party committees at all levels should do this, but also the party organizations in various people's organizations should do this, and the various departments of the people's governments at all levels, various undertakings and factories and mines' party organizations should also do this. It is necessary to oppose the tendency of only caring about business and not asking about politics. Without doing propaganda work, and without paying attention to ideological and political work, it will inevitably bring blindness to oneself, and even fall into the quagmire of pure technical work and lose the direction of advance; it will weaken the connection between the leadership and the masses, it will make the leadership lag behind the masses, and it will never be possible to do a good job in the specific work of a place or a department. The primary task of the leading organs is to conduct political leadership. Leading cadres at all levels and in all departments must regard themselves as political workers. It is necessary to educate all staff to learn the method of using propaganda to promote work, and to make everyone a party propagandist. It is necessary to regularly investigate and study the ideological trends of people from all walks of life, and constantly conduct ideological education to the people through various specific works, point out the direction, and lead the people to advance.

Regarding how to strengthen the Party's propaganda and education work, the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau and the Party Committees of various provinces and cities are currently studying in detail. I will now only put forward the following opinions on a few things that need to be done urgently:

One, strengthen theoretical education work. A group of senior cadres have now made their own plans and started to study the theoretical works of Marxism-Leninism and the theoretical works of Comrade Mao Zedong. The Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Ningxia Provincial Party Committees and the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee have all begun to train teachers for theoretical education. These must be persisted in, and actively prepared to launch a larger-scale study movement next year. At present, it is necessary to greatly promote the application of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to summarize work experience, explain practical problems, and overcome the tendency of empiricism.

Two, regularly issue propaganda points downwards. Not only should there be general propaganda points in each period, but also summarize the existing experience and write propaganda points for each important work. For example, for land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, religious reform, agricultural production, industrial production, trade work, cooperative work, water conservancy construction, insurance, savings and other work, the Party's propaganda departments should cooperate with the Party organizations of various competent departments to propose the main content, strategies, and methods of propaganda work, write them into points, and promptly send them down to educate the entire Party and do a good job in ideological and political work in various practical works.

Three, the movement to formulate patriotic covenants is the best way for the masses to conduct self-education and should be promoted universally. The most important thing is to formulate specific and feasible patriotic covenants based on enlightening the masses' awareness and after full consultation. In places where they have already been formulated, they should be inspected and summarized in a timely manner, the good experience should be promoted, and the shortcomings of formalism should be corrected.

Four, improve publishing work and provide a large number of popular readings for workers and peasants. The Northwest Grand Administrative Region-level organs have published dozens of kinds of publications, most of which are very thick, the articles are very long, they are rough and not refined, flashy and not practical, and even introduce erroneous views and working methods as good experience. With so many things, the cadres below cannot finish reading them and cannot digest them. And what they need most is often not available. It is necessary to rectify the existing various publications, remove those that are not well-run and dispensable; concentrate efforts to run a few of the most necessary ones; and greatly promote the compilation and printing of popular readings to meet the needs of the broad masses of workers and peasants. This matter should be strived to be done well in the near future. Various localities should also pay attention to this issue.

Five, improve school education and train worker-peasant activists. The Party Committees in various places must strengthen the leadership over school education. According to the instructions of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, actively and properly carry out the reform work of the education cause; unite and improve the broad masses of education workers to better serve the people's education cause. For the large number of worker-peasant activists who have emerged in the mass struggle, various appropriate methods must be adopted to train them, cultivate a group of party members, cultivate a group of cadres, and make the mass movement take root. This is extremely important. In areas where the work of reorganizing the Party's grassroots organizations has begun, it is necessary to combine the work of educating party members on communism and the Communist Party with the work of training and cultivating worker-peasant activists.

Six, strengthen the leadership over literary and artistic work. The literary and artistic circles in the Northwest are united and the work has been successful. The problem is that the Party's leadership on this front is still very weak. We have provided less help and not enough regular and specific guidance to the vast number of non-Party literary and artistic workers, which has affected the development and progress of literary and artistic work, which is a fact. How do we help and guide others? I think criticism is necessary; but the most effective method is to produce truly good works ourselves to play a demonstrative role, let others take a look, and guide them to learn from our advantages; and, if we discover good works from others, we should also commend them and promote them. However, precisely in this regard, our achievements are too few. In the vigorous movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the land reform movement, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, what have we written? Very little. There is a "Defending the Village Regime", which is performed in the countryside of Chang'an, and the masses admire it very much; but some of our comrades look down on it, and do not advocate it or promote it. Some of our famous writers have not had new works published for two or three years. In this way, how will we lead the work of the entire literary and artistic circles? It is hoped that the comrades of the relevant departments will first seriously discuss this issue and propose ways to improve it.

Seven, through newspapers and periodicals, launch criticisms of various erroneous ideas. The vulgar liberalist atmosphere exists in our ranks, making the Party's activities on the ideological front appear weak and powerless, and must be resolutely opposed. It is necessary to respond to the call of the People's Daily and continue to carry out criticisms of "The Life of Wu Xun". We must also learn the method of ideological criticism led by the People's Daily in launching criticisms of "The Life of Wu Xun", seize specific events of fundamental nature, and launch extensive discussions with a realistic spirit, guide in-depth analysis, draw clear and thorough conclusions, and use it to improve the level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought inside and outside the Party. In the recent period, we must launch necessary ideological struggles against the tendency of cadres in the Party not to ask about politics.

Eight, the Party committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership over propaganda and education work, help the propaganda departments improve their work level, and gradually enrich the working cadres of the propaganda departments. This time, Comrade Ma Mingfang personally participated in the propaganda work conference convened by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee to the end, and gave many important instructions, which greatly improved the work confidence of the cadres of the propaganda departments, which is a very good example. The working cadres of the propaganda departments should also improve their working methods, strengthen their connection with various departments, pay more attention to understanding the actual work situation of various aspects, focus on grasping the ideological and political work of the entire Party, regularly summarize experience, and improve the ideological and combat effectiveness of the propaganda departments' work, so as to make them powerful assistants to the Party committees.

It is hoped that everyone will consider these opinions, think of more ways, and make the Party's propaganda and education work be implemented conscientiously and smoothly here. This is extremely important for our Party's work today.

    为加强马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的宣传而斗争
    ——七月二十日在中共中央西北局干部会议上的报告
    习仲勋
    我们的党，向来是重视宣传工作，重视思想政治工作的。中国革命从“星星之火”到全国胜利，就是马克思列宁主义理论的广泛传布并与中国人民的革命斗争相结合的发展过程，就是毛泽东思想发扬广大并取得了伟大胜利的发展过程。毛泽东思想，就是马列主义和中国革命相结合的思想。这种思想是中国共产党的指导思想，是中国人民革命运动的指针。
    在西北地区，最近一年来，我们做了很多工作：在七百万人口地区完成了土地改革，在全西北地区开展了抗美援朝爱国运动和镇压反革命运动，开展了生产运动以及其它各项民主建设工作。一个运动紧接着一个运动，不论城市、乡村，每个地方都经过了一次或数次热烈的群众运动。各级党的组织，在这些运动中间，都进行了极大规模的时事、政治、政策的群众宣传工作。在干部教育和学校教育中，也进行了一些马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想基本理论的宣传教育工作。发动了各族、各界广大的人民群众，参加了上述各种运动，在实际斗争中，又不断地提高了人民的政治觉悟。这样，就使广大人民的思想政治水平空前地提高了。人民的政治热情已开始在一切工作中表现出来：工人积极生产，开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动；农民踊跃参军，缴纳公粮；青年学生热烈走上国防岗位，两次动员投考军事干部学校，都超过了规定的计划；工商界积极缴纳税款；宗教界开展了反对帝国主义文化侵略的革新运动；边疆地区各少数民族也都参加到伟大的爱国主义运动中来。今年“五一”节，全西北有一千七百余万人民参加了爱国大示威与签名拥护缔结和平公约，投票反对武装日本；其中有妇女群众四百余万。自抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优抚烈属军属的热潮，又在汹涌壮阔地开展起来了。在人民的热烈支持下，各地人民政府的各项工作，都进行得很顺利。这就证明马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想一经和革命实践相结合，为人民所掌握，就会变成不断生长着和发展着的无穷无尽的物质力量，推动着革命事业前进。
    人民群众政治觉悟的高涨，也教育了全体干部和党员。在各种工作中，强迫命令作风，大大减少了。大家从实际考验中，逐渐地认识了政治说服方法，才是党领导人民群众惟一正确的和最有效能的工作方法。全党的思想政治水平，获得了提高，工作作风有了很大进步。
    党的宣传教育事业，最近时期也有很大发展。就其规模与范围来说，是超过了西北地区党的历史上任何时期。现在，已经有了一千八百多个报告员，
    一万二千多个宣传员，再加上在各种运动中涌现出来的大批党外积极分子，由他们所形成的宣传队伍，已经是几十万人的宣传大军。这是党在群众中经常起作用的政治力量，是人民群众自己的非常宝贵的财产。我们在这一时期，又开始学会如何组织与领导各种宣传力量，如何运用广播、报纸和各种文艺活动进行宣传工作。特别是各地在群众斗争中，创造了很多新的工作方法，经验是非常丰富的。各种控诉会、说理斗争会、回忆会、展览会都是用活人活事启发群众思想觉悟的极有效的办法。经过各种代表会、积极分子会、座谈会、家庭会议，结合具体情况，讲解政策，布置任务，表扬模范事例，是推动各种工作的最好方法。广播收音站、读报组、黑板报、宣传牌等，是向群众经常地进行时事、政治宣传的好办法。在少数民族地区，出版了当地民族文字的报纸和刊物，并采取了和贸易队、卫生队相结合的方法，使宣传深入到游牧区去。这些事实都说明，党的宣传教育工作，是已经大大地推向前进了。
    可是，这并不是说，我们马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的宣传工作已经都做得很好了，已经没有什么问题了。不是的，仍然有问题，而且有很多很严重的问题。现在一般地说，我们的一切工作都是有宣传的，但其中有许多宣传工作做的不好，不善于针对人民群众的主要思想问题进行宣传，不善于使
    一切具体工作的宣传具有必要的思想性、政治性。这是形成宣传工作一般化和不深入的主要原因。如宣传售棉储棉，就不善于将农民的私人利益与国家整体利益联系起来进行宣传，不能使农民群众充分了解售棉储棉对于供应棉纺织工业原料，保证全国军民衣着，巩固工农联盟和巩固国防的重大意义。其他工作，如镇压反革命的宣传，开展生产运动的宣传，土地改革的宣传等，都存在着同样的毛病。这是目前群众宣传工作中的普遍倾向。此外，我们有些地方和有些工作，仍然忽视宣传，存在着命令主义作风。我们对于中等以上的学校教育和国民教育事业的领导，十分不够；特别是对广大在职干部的教育工作，还很松懈；不注意学习理论和认真研究中央的政策，不注意总结工作，经验主义倾向普遍存在。就连最近时期宣传教育工作方面的丰富的经验，也还没有认真地加以总结。这就使我们党的宣传部门的工作和广大群众的实践有了距离，使整个地区的宣传活动因得不到很好的指导而不能顺利前进。甚至在许多部门，许多地方的领导骨干中，已经生长着一种只管具体业务不问政治的情绪。在他们看来，思想政治工作，只是党的宣传部门少数人要做的事情，别的人是可以不管的。在他们主持的工作中，原则性不高，政治空气淡薄。资产阶级的单纯技术观点和庸俗的自由主义作风，正在侵入到党内来，并且已经使许多工作遭受重大的损失。这难道不都是事实吗？这岂不都是很严重的问题吗？这些，都是由于各地党委对于马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的宣传工作仍然重视不够，对于宣传部门工作同志的指导和帮助不够所产生的结果。
    以上，就是西北地区党的宣传教育工作的基本情况。我们在讨论今后西北宣传教育工作的时候，绝不可抛开这些实际情况，而是要密切结合这些实际情况，认真总结本地区宣传教育工作的经验，认识目前的工作环境和条件，从现有水平去提高，在已有的基础上往前进。这次，西北区宣传工作会议，就要很好地按照这个精神去做。各省、市的宣传工作会议，也要按照这个精神去做。
    在西北地区，最近时期，党的宣传教育工作的基本任务，党在思想战线上的基本任务，是什么呢？就是：围绕着继续深入抗美援朝运动和压镇反革命运动，继续开展土地改革运动，开展生产运动，开展宗教改革运动和继续巩固民族团结等项重大任务，继续向全体人民进行爱国主义与国际主义的教育，阶级斗争的教育，发展生产的教育，批判各种不利于人民民主事业的错误思想，并继续提高全党的思想政治水平，以便动员全体人民为实现上述各项重大任务而斗争。我们所要做的上述各项工作，无一不具有思想的、政治的内容。抛弃或降低思想政治工作而盲目地进行实际工作的经验主义倾向，必须用大力加以纠正；但也要反对那种离开各种实际工作去进行空洞的思想政治工作的做法。
    我们党的宣传教育工作最主要的对象，还是工人和农民。必须切实改进对工人阶级和农民的宣传教育工作，以达到提高工人阶级，领导农民前进，巩固工农联盟的目的。西北地区的工人阶级，其主要部分是在新区，是曾长期生活在国民党反动派的统治下的。解放后我们对他们虽做了一些宣传教育工作，但还十分不够。反动派的各种思想影响在工人群众中仍然存在，特别是在许多工厂企业中，旧的残余的反动势力仍然存在。最近时期我们就必须在这些工厂企业中补上开展民主改革运动这一课，以便清除这些残余反动势力，清除反动派的思想影响。今后，随着经济建设的发展，工人阶级的队伍也必然要有很大的发展，将有很大数量的农民、城市贫民、小资产阶级的分子走进工人阶级队伍中来。我们的党是工人阶级的先锋队。我们必须向所有的工人群众进行系统的马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的教育，以便使工人阶级具备高度的政治自觉性，更好地担负起领导国家建设的责任。西北地区的农民，是生活在不同地区的——有老区，有已完成土地改革的新区，有未经土地改革的新区，有少数民族地区，情况是极其复杂的。在今后两三年内，一切未经过土地改革的地区，我们都要领导农民坚决地完成土地改革。可是，我们现在是建设新民主主义社会，将来是要向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展的，因此，仅仅领导农民完成土地改革还是远远不够的。特别是随着土地改革的完成和经济建设的发展，不论在城市和乡村，资本主义的经济成份必然会有所发展，农民群众的资本主义思想也会随之发展起来。我们必须一刻也不停止地向农民进行政治教育，使农民信任工人阶级的领导，信任工农联盟，并在各种实际行动中，拥护共产党和人民政府的各项具体政策，逐步地认识农业社会化的光明灿烂的远景，引导农民继续走向正确的道路。这些，都是要经过长期的艰苦的工作的。
    最重要的问题，是动员全党都做宣传工作。不论做那一项工作，都要向人民作宣传，而且要使各项具体工作的宣传具有必要的思想的政治的内容。不仅各级党委员会的宣传部、组织部、统一战线工作部及其他部门要这样做，各人民团体中党的组织要这样做，各级人民政府的各部门、各事业机关和工厂、矿山的党的组织也都要这样做。要反对只管业务不问政治的倾向。不做宣传工作，不注意思想政治工作，就必然会给自己带来盲目性，以至陷入单纯技术工作的泥坑而迷失前进的方向；就会减弱领导同群众的联系，就会使领导落后于群众，也就绝不可能做好一个地方或一个部门的具体工作。领导机关的首要任务，就是进行政治领导。各地方、各部门的领导干部，必须把自己看作是一个政治工作者。要教育一切工作人员都学会用宣传来推动工作的方法，使他们每个人都成为党的宣传员。要经常调查研究各阶层人民的思想动态，不断地经过各种具体工作，向人民进行思想教育，指出方向，并领导人民前进。
    关于如何加强党的宣传教育工作，目前正在由西北局宣传部及各省、市党委详细研究。我现在只就目前迫切要做的几件事情，提出以下意见：
    一、加强理论教育工作。现已有一批高级干部，自定计划，开始学习马克思列宁主义的理论著作和毛泽东同志的理论著作。陕西、青海、宁夏省委、西安市委，都已开始训练理论教育的教员。这些，都要坚持下去，并积极准备好开展明年更大规模的学习运动。目前，就要大大提倡应用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，来总结工作经验，说明实际问题，克服经验主义倾向。
    二、经常向下发宣传要点。不仅每一时期要有一般的宣传要点，还要总结已有的经验，写出每项重要工作的宣传要点。如土地改革、镇压反革命、宗教革新、农业生产、工业生产、贸易工作、合作社工作、水利建设、保险、储蓄等等工作，都要由党的宣传部门协同各主管部门党的组织，提出宣传工作的主要内容、策略、方法，写成要点；并及时发下去，教育全党，做好在进行各种实际工作中的思想政治工作。
    三、订立爱国公约的运动，是人民群众进行自我教育的最好的方式，要普遍地推行。最重要的是必须在启发群众觉悟的基础上，经过充分酝酿，订立具体可行的爱国公约。已经订立的地方，要适时地检查、总结，推广好的经验，纠正形式主义的毛病。
    四、改善出版工作，大量供给工农群众的通俗读物。西北大行政区一级机关，出了几十种刊物，大都是本子很厚，文章很长，粗而不精，华而不实，甚而有将错误的观点和工作方法，也当作好的经验去介绍的。这样多的东西，底下的干部看不完，消化不了。而他们所最需要的东西，却又往往没有。必须将现有各种出版物加以整顿，去掉那些办得不好的和可有可无的；集中力量办好几种最必需的；并大大提倡编印通俗读物，以满足广大工农群众的要求。这件事情，应当争取在最近时期办好。各地方也要注意这个问题。
    五、改善学校教育工作和训练工农积极分子。各地党委必须加强对学校教育工作的领导。按照中央人民政府教育部的指示，积极地而又妥善地进行教育事业的改革工作；团结和提高广大的教育工作者，更好地为人民的教育事业服务。对于群众斗争中涌现出来的大量的工农积极分子，必须采取各种适宜的方式加以训练，培养出一批党员，培养出一批干部，并使群众运动生根。这是极为重要的。在开始整理党的基层组织的地区，一定要把向党员进行共产主义和共产党的教育的工作，与训练和培养工农积极分子的工作结合起来。
    六、加强对文学艺术工作的领导。西北的文学艺术界是团结的，工作是有成绩的。问题在于党在这个战线上的领导工作，还是很薄弱的。我们对于党外广大的文艺工作者帮助少，指导不够经常和具体，因而影响了文艺工作的发展和进步，这是事实。我们怎样去帮助和指导人家呢？我以为，批评是要的；但最有效的方法，是自己拿出真正好的作品来起示范作用，叫人家看一看，引导人家向我们的好处学习；并且，发现了人家的好的作品也同样去表扬，去推广。可是，恰恰在这方面，我们的成绩太少了。在轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动、土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动中，我们写出了什么东西呢？很少很少。有一个“保卫村政权”，在长安乡下演出，群众都很赞美；可是我们有些同志又瞧不起它，不去提倡，不去推广。我们有些著名的作家，有的已经两三年没有新作品问世了。这样，我们将怎样去领导整个文艺界的工作呢？这个问题，希望有关部门的同志们，先去认真讨论一下，提出如何改进的办法来。
    七、通过报纸、刊物，展开对各种错误思想的批判。庸俗的自由主义空气，在我们队伍中存在着，使党在思想战线上的活动显得软弱无力，必须坚决反对。要响应人民日报的号召，继续开展对“武训传”的批判。也要学习人民日报领导开展批判“武训传”的思想批评的方法，抓住带根本性质问题的具体事件，以实事求是的精神，展开广泛的讨论，引导进行深刻的分析，得出明确透彻的结论，用以提高党内外的马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的水平。最近时期，我们就要针对党内干部中不问政治的倾向，开展必要的思想斗争。
    八、各级党委都应加强对宣传教育工作的领导，帮助宣传部门提高工作水平，逐渐地充实宣传部门的工作干部。这次陕西省委召开的宣传工作会议，马明方同志亲自参加到底，并作了许多重要的指示，大大提高了宣传部门干部的工作信心，是一个很好的范例。宣传部门的工作干部，也要改进自己的工作方法，加强同各部门的联系，多多注意了解各方面的实际工作情况，着重掌握全党的思想政治工作，经常总结经验，提高宣传部门工作的思想性、战斗性，使之成为党委员会的有力的助手。
    这些意见，希望大家考虑一番，多多想出办法，使党的宣传教育工作在我们这里，认真地、顺利地实行起来。这对于我们今天全党的工作来说，是极其重要的。
