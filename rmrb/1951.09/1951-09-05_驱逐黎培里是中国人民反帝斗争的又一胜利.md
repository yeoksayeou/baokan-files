    Expelling Archbishop Riberi is Another Victory for the Chinese People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle
    Sun Dianwei
    The Nanjing Military Control Commission, accepting the common demands of the people of the whole country and patriotic Catholics, issued an order on September 4th to permanently expel the imperialist element, Archbishop Riberi, from our country's territory, who had remained in Nanjing after liberation to engage in sabotage activities. This is a significant victory for the Chinese people in their struggle against imperialism, particularly against imperialism's use of religion for aggression.
    Since arriving in China at the end of 1946 under the guise of "Apostolic Nuncio to China," Archbishop Riberi actively engaged in activities against the Chinese people. He wholeheartedly supported the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's anti-communist and anti-people civil war, claiming that "Only the Pope of the Catholic Church (referring to the Roman Pontiff) and the President of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang bandit Kai-shek) represent the hopes and interests of the vast majority of mankind in the world." As Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime neared collapse in 1947, Archbishop Riberi, through his reactionary propaganda tool – the Yishi Zhoukan (Social Welfare Weekly) – openly called on Catholics to organize a "Catholic Party" and a "Anti-Communist Crusade." After the liberation of Nanjing, Archbishop Riberi continued to remain on the territory of New China to engage in sabotage activities: he instructed his henchmen to establish and develop secret reactionary organizations – the Legion of Mary – in many areas; he colluded with and shielded other imperialist elements to carry out espionage and assassination activities. For example, in the recently adjudicated case of the American spy plot to bomb Tiananmen Square, one of the criminals, Ma Di-nuo, was Archbishop Riberi's representative in Beijing; he incited Chinese Catholics to resist the People's Government, and incited them to refuse to cooperate with their own government; he published and distributed a large number of reactionary books and periodicals, such as "The Terrible Communism," etc.; finally, he sabotaged the Chinese people's patriotic movements – the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and the Three-Self Reform Movement of Catholics.
    Archbishop Riberi's series of criminal activities were carried out under the guise of religion and under the instructions of US imperialism and the Vatican. Archbishop Riberi was merely the executor of US imperialism and the Vatican's use of religion to invade China. Therefore, the People's Government's announcement of the expulsion of Archbishop Riberi is not only a punishment for him personally, but more importantly, a blow to US imperialism and its tool of aggression, the Vatican. The people of the whole country and patriotic Catholics should learn from Archbishop Riberi's crimes and further recognize the heinous fact of US imperialism's use of religion to invade China.
    From the day he arrived in China, Archbishop Riberi treated the Chinese people with an attitude of oppression. In his letter to the bishops of various dioceses at the end of March this year, he was still issuing orders to Chinese Catholics, openly demanding that Chinese Catholics take his will as their own. His acts of aggression finally aroused the anger of patriotic Catholics in various places, who rose up to oppose him. However, Archbishop Riberi still attempted to use despicable means of intimidation and bribery to "suppress" the resistance of patriotic Catholics against him. When "suppression" proved ineffective, he instructed his lackeys to continue to treat Catholics with various methods of threats, on the one hand, and on the other hand, he cunningly attempted to shirk his various responsibilities for aggression.
    In the movement of Catholic masses against Archbishop Riberi, imperialist elements and their lackeys lurking in churches in various places came out to interfere, obstruct, and sabotage. For example, Yang Enlai, the German Bishop of Shandong, used so-called "divine power" to deprive Dong Wenlong, the Chinese Deputy Bishop who led Catholics in opposing Archbishop Riberi, of his "divine office" and "divine functions." Later, due to protests from Catholics, he revoked the "decree," but his sabotage did not stop. Another example is Dong Shizhi, Archbishop Riberi's loyal lackey, who openly delivered absurd speeches at gatherings of Catholics in Chongqing, making sophistry for Archbishop Riberi. These facts show that the actions of imperialist elements using religion for aggression are by no means an "isolated phenomenon." Therefore, it is necessary to continue to eliminate all imperialist elements and their lackeys hidden behind cassocks.
    From this struggle with Archbishop Riberi, patriotic Catholics should especially learn an important lesson, which is that they must change their past psychology of blind obedience. Due to long-term deception and propaganda by imperialism, Catholics have developed a habit of "blind obedience" to so-called "spiritual leaders" and "divine authority," losing their ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and to distinguish between good and bad. This blind obedience is very dangerous. Because the facts are very clear: Can an imperialist element like Archbishop Riberi be a good "spiritual leader"? The result of blindly obeying him is that one will be used by him and embark on a path of betraying the motherland and betraying the people. Therefore, patriotic Catholics throughout the country should firmly remember this lesson, change their attitude of blind obedience, oppose all imperialist elements and their lackeys who claim to be "spiritual leaders," and oppose the despicable conspiracies of those who have committed crimes under the guise of "divine authority."
    The People's Government, accepting the unanimous demands of the people of the whole country and patriotic Catholics, and based on conclusive evidence, has expelled Archbishop Riberi, who has harmed the Chinese people, from the country. This measure is very correct. The religious policy of the People's Government is to protect true freedom of belief, and it never forces people to believe in or oppose religion. However, it will never allow imperialism and its lackeys to use religion to engage in counter-revolutionary political activities, because such counter-revolutionary political activities have gone beyond the scope of belief, and they are not only harmful to the Chinese people, but also destructive to freedom of belief. Therefore, the People's Government cannot but strictly prohibit them. Facts have proved that the People's Government is the true defender of freedom of belief, the true defender of the interests of the people of the whole country, and the firm supporter of all patriotic and just actions. All patriotic and religious Catholics in China should unite more closely around the People's Government and continue to struggle for the thorough completion of the Three-Self Reform Movement.

    驱逐黎培里是中国人民反帝斗争的又一胜利
    孙殿伟
    南京市军事管制委员会接受全国人民和爱国天主教徒的共同要求，已于九月四日下令将解放以后仍留居南京进行破坏活动的帝国主义分子黎培里永远驱逐出我国国境。这是中国人民在反对帝国主义、特别是反对帝国主义利用宗教从事侵略的斗争中所取得的一个重大胜利。
    黎培里自一九四六年底以“教廷驻华公使”的名义来到中国以后，即积极地进行反对中国人民的活动。他曾经全力支持蒋介石匪帮反共反人民的内战，声称“只有天主教的教宗（指罗马教皇）和中华民国的大总统（指蒋匪介石），他们所代表的才是世界上最大多数的人类的希望与利益。”当一九四七年蒋介石的反动政权临近崩溃之际，黎培里通过他的反动宣传工具——益世周刊，公开号召天主教徒组织“天主教党”，组织“反共十字军”。南京解放以后，黎培里继续留在新中国的领土上从事破坏活动：他指使他的爪牙在许多地区建立和发展秘密反动组织——圣母军；他勾结和掩护其他帝国主义分子进行间谍暗害活动，例如最近判决的阴谋炮轰天安门的美国间谍案中，凶犯之一的马迪懦便是黎培里的驻北京代表；他煽动中国天主教徒与人民政府相对抗，唆使他们拒绝与自己的政府合作；他出版和散布大量的反动书刊，例如“恐怖的共产主义”等等；最后他又破坏中国人民的爱国运动——中国人民的抗美援朝运动，天主教徒的三自革新运动。
    黎培里的这一系列的罪恶活动，是在宗教外衣的掩护下进行的，是在美帝国主义和梵蒂冈的指示下进行的。黎培里只是美帝国主义和梵蒂冈利用宗教侵略中国的执行人罢了。因此，人民政府宣布将黎培里驱逐出境，不仅是对他个人的惩罚，更重要的是对美帝国主义及其侵略工具梵蒂冈的打击。全国人民和爱国天主教徒都应该从黎培里的罪证中吸取教训，进一步认识美帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国的这一罪恶事实。
    黎培里从到中国的那一天起，就是以压迫者的态度对待中国人民的。今年三月底他给各教区主教的信中，还是向中国天主教徒发号施令，公然要中国天主教徒以他的意旨为意旨。他的侵略罪行终于激起了各地爱国天主教徒的愤怒，纷纷起来反对。但是黎培里还想用威吓利诱的卑鄙手段来“镇压”爱国天主教徒对他的反抗。“镇压”无效，他一面指使他的走狗继续用各种威胁的办法来对待教徒，另一方面他又狡赖地企图推诿他的各种侵略罪责。
    在天主教徒群众反对黎培里的运动当中，潜伏在各地教会中的帝国主义分子及其走狗纷纷出来干涉、阻挠和破坏。例如山东德籍主教杨恩赉利用所谓“神权”，剥夺了领导教徒反对黎培里的华籍副主教董文龙的“神职”和“神功”，后来因教徒抗议，方才收回“成命”，但他的破坏仍未停止。又如黎培里的忠实走狗董世祉，公然在重庆市天主教徒的集会上发表荒谬演说，为黎培里作诡辩。这些事实说明：帝国主义分子利用宗教进行侵略的行动决不是什么“个别现象”，因此，必须继续肃清一切掩藏在袈裟后面的帝国主义分子及其走狗。
    从这次与黎培里的斗争当中，爱国天主教徒应该特别吸取一个重要的教训，这便是必须改变过去的盲从心理。由于长期地受着帝国主义的欺骗宣传，天主教徒对于所谓“神长”、“神权”养成了一种“盲目服从”的习惯，丧失了辨别是非、分清好坏的能力。这种盲从是十分危险的。因为事实非常明显：像黎培里这样的帝国主义分子，难道是一个善良的“神长”吗？盲从他的结果，便会被他利用，而走上背叛祖国、背弃人民的道路。因此，全国爱国的天主教徒们，应该牢牢地记住这个教训，改变盲从的态度，反对一切以“神长”自居的帝国主义分子及其走狗，反对那些犯了罪的人在“神权”的掩护下的卑鄙阴谋。
    人民政府接受全国人民和爱国天主教徒的一致要求，并根据确凿的罪证，将危害中国人民的黎培里驱逐出境，这一措施是十分正确的。人民政府的宗教政策是保护真正的信仰自由，决不强迫人信仰或反对宗教，但是也决不允许帝国主义及其走狗利用宗教来从事反革命的政治活动，因为这种反革命的政治活动已越出了信仰的范围，它不但对于中国人民是一种危害，对于信仰自由也是一种破坏，因此人民政府就不能不予以严格取缔。事实证明：人民政府是信仰自由的真正维护者，是全国人民利益的真正保卫者，是一切爱国和正义的行动的坚决支持者。全中国爱国爱教的天主教徒们应该更紧密地团结在人民政府的周围，为澈底完成三自革新运动而继续奋斗。
