    Textile Workers' Union Decides on Central Tasks for the Next Four Months
    Focus on Summarizing and Promoting Mass Innovation and Advanced Experience
    Textile Workers in Shanghai and Other Places Warmly Welcome the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
    The Third Plenary Session of the First National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union decided that the central task of the Textile Workers' Union in the next four months will be to summarize mass innovation and promote advanced experience—vigorously promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and at the same time assist the administrative side or the capitalists in reforming old enterprises and appropriately improve the lives of workers and staff. This National Committee meeting was held in Qingdao from August 21st to 28th. The committee members present listened to and discussed the report by Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Textile Workers' Union, on "Closely Combining Resistance to America and Aid to Korea with Improving Production," the report by Chen Weiji, Deputy Minister of the Central Textile Industry Department, on "Summary of the Work of the Textile Industry Department in the First Half of the Year and Work Tasks for the Second Half of the Year," and the report by Wang Boquan, Chairman of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union, on "Summarizing and Promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method." It was believed that in order to better complete the production tasks assigned by the state in the second half of this year, the Hao Jianxiu Work Method must be vigorously promoted while carrying out the democratic reform movement. Because the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is the best way to improve labor productivity. The meeting required textile unions at all levels to strive for the active support of the administration in promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and suggested that the Central Textile Industry Department issue a circular to its subordinates to vigorously promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Deputy Minister Chen Weiji expressed his acceptance of this suggestion. On the last day of the meeting, a brocade banner was awarded to the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union, the summarizer and earliest promoter of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, praising them as "a model of trade unions facing production." The meeting also awarded the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union and the Jinzhou Textile Factory Committee of the Textile Workers' Union with brocade banners each, because they had outstanding achievements in eliminating illiteracy among workers and staff.

    Textile workers in Shanghai, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiaxing and other places warmly welcome the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Since the news of Hao Jianxiu's creation of a new record of less cots waste spread to Shanghai, workers in various factories have been vying to read illustrated magazines introducing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and studying her every movement. Many advanced workers have automatically started operating according to the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and have achieved results. After Xu Huifang, a young member of the Communist Youth League and a worker in Class A of the Nantextile Factory of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, studied the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the average cots waste rate from August 13th to 25th was reduced from the average of 0.5 percent of the workshop to 0.182 percent. Zheng Lijuan, a worker at Yong'an No. 3 Factory, and Lu Xiubao, a worker at Gongyong Yarn Factory, and others have also initially learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, arousing the interest of workers in the same factory in learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Now research and promotion groups for advanced work methods have been established in these factories. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union has sent cadres to factories to help grassroots trade unions summarize the experience of advanced workers, so as to prepare for the large-scale promotion work that will be launched when the delegation going to Qingdao to study the Hao Jianxiu Work Method returns to Shanghai. In Changzhou, the trade union of Dacheng No. 1 Textile Factory selected the two advanced groups of Yang Qinfang and Min Qiaodi in the factory to start learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and eleven female workers learned it in seven days. The average cots waste rate of the Min Qiaodi group has been reduced from 1.7 percent to 0.31 percent, and the quality of yarn has also been improved. In addition, the advanced groups of Wuxi Lixin Yarn Factory and Jiading Jiafeng Yarn Factory have also started learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. (Xinhua News Agency)

    纺织工会决定今后四个月的中心任务
    以总结推广群众创造和先进经验为主
    上海等地纺织工人热烈欢迎郝建秀工作法
    中国纺织工会首届第三次全国委员会议决定纺织工会今后四个月内将以总结群众创造、推广先进经验——大力推广郝建秀工作法为中心任务，同时协助行政方面或资方改革旧企业并适当地改善职工生活。此次全国委员会议于八月二十一日至二十八日在青岛召开。到会委员听取和讨论了全国纺织工会陈少敏主席“把抗美援朝与改进生产密切结合起来”的报告和中央纺织工业部陈维稷副部长关于“纺织工业部上半年工作总结和下半年工作任务”的报告以及纺织工会青岛市委员会王伯泉主席“关于总结和推广郝建秀工作法”的报告，并认为为了更好地完成今年下半年国家所赋予的生产任务，必须在进行民主改革运动的同时，大力推广郝建秀工作法。因为郝建秀工作法是提高劳动生产率的最好方法。会议要求各级纺织工会努力争取行政上积极支持推广郝建秀工作法，并建议中央纺织工业部通令所属大力推广郝建秀工作法。陈维稷副部长表示接受这个建议。会议最后一天曾以锦旗一面奖给郝建秀工作法的总结者和最先推广者——纺织工会青岛市委员会，称誉他们是“工会面向生产的榜样”。会议还奖给纺织工会旅大市委员会及纺织工会金州纺织厂委员会锦旗各一面，因为他们在消灭职工文盲方面有卓越成绩。（新华社）
    上海、无锡、常州、嘉兴等地纺织工人热烈欢迎郝建秀工作法。自郝建秀创造少出皮辊花新纪录的消息传到上海后，各厂工人都争看介绍郝建秀工作法的画刊，研究她的每个动作。不少先进工人自动按照郝建秀工作法操作起来，并取得了成绩。上海国棉一厂南纺厂甲班工人青年团员徐惠芳学习了郝建秀工作法后，八月十三日到二十五日的平均皮辊花率就从该车间平均数字百分之零点五降低到百分之零点一八二。永安三厂工人郑丽娟和公永纱厂工人陆秀宝等也初步学会了郝建秀工作法，并引起同厂工人们学习郝建秀工作法的兴趣。现在这些厂子里已成立了研究与推广先进工作法小组。纺织工会上海市委员会已派了干部下厂，帮助基层工会总结先进工作者的经验，为前往青岛学习郝建秀工作法的代表团回到上海时即将大规模展开的推广工作作好准备。在常州，大成第一纺织厂工会选定该厂杨琴芳、闵巧娣两个先进小组开始学习郝建秀工作法，七天当中就有十一个女工学会了。闵巧娣小组平均皮辊花率已由百分之一点七降低到百分之零点三一，并且提高了纱的质量。此外，无锡丽新纱厂、嘉定嘉丰纱厂的先进小组也都开始了郝建秀工作法的学习。（新华社）
