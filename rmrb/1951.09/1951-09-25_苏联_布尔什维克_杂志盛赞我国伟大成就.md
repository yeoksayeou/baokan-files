Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 21st: The latest issue of the Bolshevik magazine published a lengthy article co-authored by Nikolai and Sherbakov: "The Achievements of the People's Republic of China." The article stated: "The Chinese revolution broke the chains of imperialism in its colonial rear and became a historical turning point for all Asian people enslaved by American, British, and other imperialisms. The People's Republic of China firmly stands in the camp of peace and democracy. The fraternal relationship between the Chinese and Soviet people is expanding and consolidating day by day. The most important content of their friendly alliance is the common struggle for peace, cooperation on the international stage, close economic ties, increasing Soviet assistance to China in technology and production, and beneficial exchanges between cultural and social groups of the two countries." The article then pointed out the fact that the imperialist camp, headed by the United States, is hostile to the People's China, especially the recent unilateral and illegal actions of the United States to exclude the People's Republic of China from participating in the drafting and signing of the peace treaty with Japan. The article said: "The process of the Kaesong talks has once again undoubtedly proved that the Chinese and Korean people hope for a peaceful resolution, while the American culprits who launched the bloody war are trying to undermine the talks and expand the flames of war in the Far East." After introducing in detail the achievements of New China in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, the article said: "The Soviet people eagerly wish the fraternal Chinese people further achievements in the cause of building a great and prosperous people's country and in the struggle to defend world peace."

    苏联“布尔什维克”杂志盛赞我国伟大成就
     【新华社莫斯科二十一日电】最近一期布尔什维克杂志发表了尼古莱和谢尔巴科夫合撰的长篇论文：“中华人民共和国的成就”。论文说：“中国革命打断了帝国主义在其殖民地后方的锁链，成了一切被美英及其他帝国主义奴役的亚洲人民的历史转折点。中华人民共和国坚定地站在和平民主的阵营中。中苏两国人民的兄弟关系一天天地扩大和巩固。他们的友好同盟的最主要内容，是争取和平的共同斗争、在国际舞台上的合作、经济上的密切联系、苏联在技术和生产方面对中国的越来越多的援助、和两国文化团体和社会团体的有益往来。”论文接着指出以美国为首的帝国主义阵营敌视人民中国的事实，特别是最近美国以片面和非法的行为排斥中华人民共和国参加对日和约的草拟和签订。论文说：“开城谈判的过程再度确凿无疑地证明中朝人民希望和平解决，而发动血腥战争的美国元凶祸首却力图破坏谈判，扩大远东战火。”论文在详尽地介绍了新中国在政治、经济、文化等方面的成就后说：“苏联人民热切地预祝兄弟般的中国人民在建设伟大的繁荣的人民国家的事业中，在保卫世界和平的斗争中获得进一步的成就。”
