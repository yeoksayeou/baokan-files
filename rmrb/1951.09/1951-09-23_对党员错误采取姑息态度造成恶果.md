    Taking a Lenient Attitude Towards Party Members' Mistakes Leads to Evil Consequences
    Some Party organizations, instead of adopting a proactive approach of education and timely correction toward the mistakes of certain Party members, have consistently been lenient and accommodating, leading their errors to develop to the point of being beyond redemption. The attitude taken by the Party organization of the Xianyang Military Subdistrict in Shaanxi towards the mistakes of Party members Zhou Youcai and Jia Baoshu is a clear example.
    Zhou Youcai and Jia Baoshu's mistakes were extremely serious. Although Zhou Youcai came from a poor peasant background and had over ten years of revolutionary struggle history, he did not seek progress but became corrupt and degenerate, even colluding with hooligans and opium dealers to sell and smoke drugs, and even recently attempted to desert. Jia Baoshu was also a cadre of over ten years, and also smoked drugs with opium dealers, having been caught multiple times by local public security personnel. Jia also privately used public funds. After the Party organization of the military subdistrict headquarters discovered the above situation, they did not handle it according to Party principles, but instead transferred them back for "persuasion." As a result, Jia Baoshu not only did not correct his mistakes but continued to smoke drugs. The erroneous behavior of Zhou and Jia seriously damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Army among the masses.
    The reason why Zhou and Jia committed such serious mistakes is mainly because of their poor personal qualities. In addition, they did not study regularly and carried the burden of being "old timers." Politically, they were already backward during the rural war environment. After entering the city, their individual desires for pleasure and corruption greatly developed, to the point of forgetting their roots and becoming degenerate, associating with hooligans and opium dealers, and completely losing the standpoint of a Communist Party member.
    Now, the Party organization of the Xianyang Military Subdistrict in Shaanxi has given Zhou Youcai the punishment of expulsion from the Party (the decision on Jia is not yet known). However, the evil consequences caused by their past tolerance and accommodation of mistakes are worthy of vigilance by Party organizations and every Party member in all regions. We should accept this lesson, resolutely correct various erroneous tendencies, and strive to maintain the purity and discipline of the Party and uphold the lofty standards of a Communist Party member.

### 对党员错误采取姑息态度造成恶果

    对党员错误采取姑息态度造成恶果
    有些党的组织，对待某些党员的错误，不是采取积极教育、及时纠正的态度，而是一贯的姑息、迁就，以致使他们的错误发展到不可救药的地步。陕西咸阳军分区的党组织，对党员周有财、贾宝树的错误所采取的态度，就是一个显明的例证。
    周有财、贾宝树的错误是非常严重的。周有财虽系贫农出身，虽有十多年的革命斗争历史，但不求进步，腐化堕落，竟至勾结流氓、烟贩，贩卖和吸食毒品，甚至在最近还企图开小差。贾宝树也是十多年的干部，也和烟贩在一块吸食毒品，曾被地方公安人员查获多次，贾并私自动用公款。军分区司令部的党组织发现上述情况后，不是按照党的原则进行处理，而是调回“劝解”。这样，贾宝树不仅不去改正错误，反而继续吸食毒品。周、贾二人的错误行为，严重地损害了党和人民军队在群众中的威信。
    周、贾二人所以发生这种严重错误，主要是因为他们个人的品质恶劣，加上平时不学习，背上“老资格”的包袱，在农村战争环境时，政治上就已经落后了，进入城市后，大大发展了个人享乐腐化思想，以至忘本变质，与流氓、烟贩同流合污，完全丧失了共产党员的立场。
    现在陕西咸阳军分区的党组织，已给周有财以开除党籍的处分（对贾的决定尚不知道），但是，过去他们对待错误的宽容迁就所造成的恶果，值得各地党组织和每一个党员警惕。我们应当接受这一教训，坚决纠正各种错误倾向，为保持党的纯洁性和纪律性，坚持共产党员崇高标准而斗争。
