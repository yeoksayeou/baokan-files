Party Life

    Tang Zhigao, the District Chief of the Sixth District of Lincheng County, Shandong Province, and a member of the Sixth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Lincheng County, interfered with the marriage of Zhang Xueshan and a widow, Ms. Yang, in Xinzhuang Village in the district and arbitrarily detained people, violating national laws.
    Ms. Yang, a widow from Xinzhuang Village, is 39 years old this year. She became a widow at the age of nineteen. Because her family lacked labor, she often asked Zhang Xueshan, a bachelor, to help with work. By 1949, Zhang Xueshan and Ms. Yang had developed feelings for each other, but they were afraid of gossip and did not dare to marry. In June 1950, Ms. Yang became pregnant. Afraid to live in the village, she and Zhang Xueshan moved to Longjiadian, Teng County, in August and lived together, making a living by doing small business. This spring, as the crackdown on counter-revolutionaries was in full swing, Zhang Xueshan and Ms. Yang feared that they would not be able to live in Teng County without a certificate from the Sixth District Office of Lincheng County. In June, they returned to the Sixth District of Lincheng to request the township government to process their marriage registration and provide a residence certificate. Zhang Yingtian, the township chief of Xinzhuang Township, reported Zhang Xueshan's request for registration to District Chief Tang Zhigao. Without talking to Zhang Xueshan and Ms. Yang, Tang Zhigao subjectively treated Zhang Xueshan as a counter-revolutionary and accused him of abducting a woman (Although Zhang Xueshan had worked as a cook in the puppet township government in 1947, the Lincheng County Party Committee later confirmed that he was definitely not a counter-revolutionary). He ordered the township cadres to take him back to the village for reflection and control and forbade him from marrying Ms. Yang. At the same time, he ordered the township chief to force Ms. Yang to marry Xie Hongbin, a cook in the District Office (who is over 50 years old this year). Ms. Yang firmly refused, saying, "If I am not allowed to marry Zhang Xueshan, then I will find someone outside." The township chief, under the instruction of Tang Zhigao, replied, "You can't just find someone randomly." At the same time, with the consent of District Chief Tang Zhigao, militiamen were sent to detain Ms. Yang at the District Office. During her detention, Tang Zhigao, through township cadre Zhang Shikuan and the director of the Women's Federation, forced Ms. Yang to remarry the cook, Xie Hongbin. Ms. Yang continued to refuse. Later, Ms. Yang approached Tang Zhigao three times, asking to marry Zhang Xueshan. Tang Zhigao still threatened her and refused to let her marry. More than ten days later, under coercion, Ms. Yang had no choice but to marry Xie Hongbin. At that time, the masses reflected: "People go to the District Office to register for marriage, and the District Chief messes it up; the District Chief forces women to marry his own cook, and that is not 'illegal'; who will dare to register for marriage in the district in the future?"
    In August, after the Lincheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this incident, it organized Shi Hongguang, secretary of the Lincheng County Committee of the Communist Youth League, Qi Ming, director of the County Women's Federation, Cao Wenjun from the County People's Government, and Ni Dongji from the County Party Committee to go to the district for investigation on the 20th. After hearing the news, District Chief Tang Zhigao tried every means to conceal the truth, asking Township Chief Zhang Yingtian to claim ignorance, saying, "As long as the district and township deny it, there will be no problem." He also said to the cook, Xie Hongbin, "You can say that marrying Ms. Yang was voluntary." He also made arrangements among the staff of the District Office and individual farmers. When comrades Ni Dongji and Shi Hongguang were investigating, they spoke with Tang Zhigao many times, but Tang denied knowing anything. It was not until Township Chief Zhang Yingtian, township cadre Zhang Shikuan, district public security officer Liu Nianxiang, district party secretary Zhang Chengdong, the village Women's Federation director, and the parties involved, Zhang Xueshan and Ms. Yang, as well as local residents, confirmed Tang Zhigao's illegal interference with marital freedom that Tang was forced to admit that there were errors in handling this case.
    The Lincheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the reason for Tang Zhigao's mistake stems from the remnants of feudal ideology. He did not realize that the reason why Zhang Xueshan and Ms. Yang did not register their marriage in the past was because they did not understand the Marriage Law, which was precisely the result of feudal marriage being involuntary. Tang Zhigao groundlessly said that he abducted a woman. He not only refused to register the marriage, but also abused his power and arbitrarily detained Ms. Yang, and forced her to marry Xie Hongbin of the District Office. This erroneous behavior endangers marital freedom, violates human rights, damages the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses, and hinders the implementation of the Marriage Law. After the incident, he not only failed to conduct a self-criticism, but also tried to cover up the truth and adopted a deceptive attitude towards the Party. Therefore, the higher-level Party committee decided to give Tang Zhigao a public warning, circulate a notice throughout the county (and report to the prefectural committee), and suggested that the government give him the due punishment. District Party Secretary Zhang Chengdong, who did not stop this in advance and did not report to the county party committee afterwards, was criticized. In addition, Zhang Yingtian and others were also criticized. The County People's Government also decided to give Tang Zhigao a demerit. The District Office was instructed to approve the marriage registration of Zhang Xueshan and Ms. Yang.

    山东临城六区区长汤志高滥用职权干涉婚姻自由
    山东临城县六区区长、中共临城县六区区委委员汤志高，干涉该区辛庄村张学善与寡妇杨氏的婚姻，并任意扣人，违反了国家法律。
    辛庄村寡妇杨氏，今年三十九岁。十九岁起就开始守寡，因家中缺乏劳动力，就经常找单身汉张学善帮助做活。到一九四九年，张学善与杨氏有了感情，但怕某些人们的议论，不敢结婚。一九五○年六月杨氏怀孕，不敢在村居住，便在八月间与张学善迁到滕县龙家店同居，靠做小生意过活。今年春天，各地大张旗鼓镇压反革命，张学善等因为没有临城县六区区公所的证明信，深恐不能在滕县居住，便在六月间一同回到临城六区，要求乡政府办理结婚手续和安家证明信。辛庄乡乡长张盈田便将张学善等要求登记的情况向区长汤志高作了报告。汤志高没有找张学善与杨氏谈话，便主观地将张学善当做反革命分子，并判他拐带妇女罪（张学善在一九四七年虽曾在伪乡公所当过伙伕，但已经临城县委事后查明，确非反革命分子。），令乡干部带回村中反省管制，不准与杨氏结婚。一面又令乡长强迫杨氏与区公所炊事员谢洪斌（今年已五十多岁）结婚。杨氏坚决不答应，说：“如果不准我和张学善结婚，那么由我到外面去找对象去。”乡长在汤志高授意下回答说：“你想随便找对象，不行。”同时，并经区长汤志高的同意，派民兵将杨氏送区公所管押。在羁押期间，汤志高通过乡干部张世宽、妇联主任强迫杨氏改嫁炊事员谢洪斌。杨氏继续拒绝。以后，杨氏曾找过汤志高三次，要求与张学善结婚。汤志高仍威吓她，不让她结婚。十多天之后，杨氏在威迫之下，不得已和谢洪斌结婚。当时，群众反映：“人家到区公所登记结婚，区长就胡搞；区长强迫妇女和自己炊事员结婚，就不“非法”了；以后谁敢到区里登记结婚？”
    八月间，中共临城县委会发现这一事件后，即于二十日组织青年团临城县工委书记师鸿光、县妇联主任齐明、县人民政府曹文俊、县委倪东吉等赴该区调查。区长汤志高闻讯后，乃多方设法隐瞒，要乡长张盈田推说不知道，并说：“只要区、乡推开，就没有问题。”又对炊事员谢洪斌说：“你可以说与杨氏结婚是双方自愿的。”他在区公所人员及个别农民中也进行了布置。倪东吉、师鸿光等同志在调查时，曾与汤志高谈话多次，而汤都推说不知道。直到乡长张盈田、乡干部张世宽、区公安员刘念乡、区委书记张成栋、村妇联主任及当事人张学善、杨氏，以及当地群众证实了汤志高干涉婚姻自由的违法行为以后，汤才被迫承认在此案的处理上有错误。
    中共临城县委会认为：汤志高发生这一错误的原因，系根源于残余的封建思想意识，他没有认识到：张学善与杨氏过去所以没有进行结婚登记，是由于他们不了解婚姻法，也正是封建婚姻不自主的结果。汤志高却毫无根据地说他拐带妇女，不仅不准予登记，更滥用职权，擅将杨氏扣押起来，又强迫她和区公所谢洪斌结婚。这种错误行为危害了婚姻自由，侵犯了人权，损害了党与人民政府在群众中的威信，使婚姻法的贯彻受到障碍。在事件发生后，他不但不进行检讨，反而多方掩饰，对党采取欺骗隐瞒的态度。因此上级党委决定给汤志高以当众警告处分，通报全县（并报地委），并建议政府给予应有的处分。该区区委书记张成栋对此事先不加制止，事后也不向县委报告，给予批评。此外，对张盈田等亦进行了批评。县人民政府亦决定给汤志高记大过一次的处分。对张学善、杨氏二人，则要区公所准予办理结婚手续。
