    Beijing Catholic Reform Committee Established Yesterday
    Delegates Angrily Accuse Imperialists of Using Religion to Invade China
    Determined to Deepen the Reform Movement and Thoroughly Eliminate Imperialist Elements from the Church
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Catholic Reform Representative Conference was held at the Fu Jen Catholic University auditorium on the 16th and 17th, and the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee was established.
    Four hundred and ninety representatives attended this reform representative conference. For the first time in history, they gathered to accuse imperialist elements of using religion to invade China and to discuss how to further deepen the Catholic reform movement in Beijing.
    On the morning of the 16th, the meeting began. Zhang Yingkui, a representative of the Joint Conference of Directors of the Catholic Reform Committees in Beijing, reported on the progress of the reform movement, stating: Our Beijing Catholic Church's autonomous, self-supporting, and self-propagating reform movement began in May of this year. Over the past four months, our vast number of patriotic Catholics, through learning, accusations, and struggle, and with the support of people from all walks of life, have finally enabled our reform movement to develop universally. To date, the number of Catholic believers and priests who have participated in our reform movement accounts for the vast majority of Catholics in the city. This is a victory for our reform movement and a victory for the liberation of Chinese Catholicism from the clutches of imperialism.
    He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government, addressed the meeting. He pointed out: The Beijing Catholic Church's self-reliance reform movement, starting from the broad masses of believers at the grassroots level, mobilized the masses, organized study groups and reform committees by district, and then expanded to establish a city-wide reform committee on this basis. This is the right way to do it, because it gives the self-reliance reform movement a relatively solid mass base. Speaking of the national Catholic reform movement, this is a very good experience. The whole country should learn from this experience. He called on Catholics to more actively participate in the various patriotic movements of the motherland, and to heighten their vigilance to smash the sabotage conspiracies of imperialist elements, and to thoroughly complete the Catholic reform movement.
    In the afternoon, Vice Mayor Wu Han personally attended the meeting and delivered a speech, and accepted the flag presented by the conference to the Municipal People's Government. His speech focused on explaining the religious policy of the People's Government and how believers should promote the spirit of patriotism. He called on all the representatives present to unite all Catholics under the patriotic banner of opposing imperialism, on the basis of the Common Program, to thoroughly complete the Catholic reform movement, and to build our great motherland even better together with the people of the whole country.
    The afternoons of the 16th and the morning of the 17th were for general speeches at the conference. Twenty-three representatives, including representatives of Catholics from various churches, priests, and monks, spoke. In their speeches, the representatives successively accused the imperialist elements within the Catholic Church and their running dogs of their crimes. Zhang Shouzhi, representative of the Dongjiaominxiang Catholic Church, Lu Duansheng, representative of the Weiran Hutong Catholic Church, Nan Mianzhi, representative of the Xiaojingchang Catholic Church, Gan Xinquan, representative of the Huizhaosi Catholic Church, and others all accused the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," which was hostile to the Chinese people within the Catholic Church, of its crimes, such as spreading reactionary rumors, forbidding Catholics from reading progressive books and the People's Daily, inciting Catholics to oppose the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, collecting intelligence for the American-Chiang bandit gang, and prohibiting young and children Catholics from joining the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers, etc. Zhang Shouzhi sadly accused his father, Zhang Hanxiang, of being a traitor and special agent. He said that his reactionary father was the chairman of the Beijing branch of the "Legion of Mary," who plundered farmers' property under the guise of church power, becoming a large landlord occupying dozens of hectares of land; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he colluded with the Japanese invaders to kill revolutionary cadres. In the past, under the long-term deception of his father, he never knew he had a motherland. He said: "He is not my father, but our enemy. I firmly demand that the People's Government severely punish him! I am now awake, I must be a true Chinese, and I am determined to do a good job in the reform movement!" Lu Duansheng, sixteen years old, who had been deceived into joining the "Legion of Mary" in the past, exposed the situation of the "Legion of Mary" undermining the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. He was determined to withdraw from that reactionary organization and asked the government to ban the "Legion of Mary." Wang Longguo, representative of the Changxindian Catholic Church, accused the crimes of Li Dejing, a traitor and local tyrant in a priest's robe. He said that Li Dejing relied on the power of the Japanese military police to oppress Catholics, seize women, and severely beat his brother, causing his brother to become mentally confused and later crushed to death by a train. After liberation, Li Dejing continued to be an enemy of the people, spreading rumors, distributing reactionary documents, and illegally setting up radio stations and hiding guns and ammunition. Lin Wucai and Mi Minhua, members of the Benevolence Hall, tearfully recounted the inhuman lives they had personally lived in the Benevolence Hall, which bore the sign of "Benevolence," and the inhuman crimes of the imperialist nuns who murdered Chinese orphans. Three worker Catholics were forced to bury more than 2,400 dead people for them. Lin Wucai's four-year-old little sister was also forced to work by the imperialist elements. The children could not get enough to eat, so they had to eat the locust beans that fell from the trees. Mi Minhua's mother was also tortured to death by imperialist elements in the Benevolence Hall. During their accusations, many representatives under the stage were wiping their tears, and they angrily shouted: "Avenge the children of our motherland who were victimized!" "Eliminate the evil forces in the church!" "Down with imperialism!"
    The representatives realized that this conference was the first real representative conference of Catholic believers in Chinese history, and this was the result of the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in liberating the whole of China. In their speeches, they expressed their gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. When Feng Bona, representative of Qinghe Town Church, Feng Xiuying, representative of Fu Jen Church, and Jiang Yuezhu, representative of Xitang Church, mentioned their gratitude to Chairman Mao in their speeches, they turned around and bowed deeply to Chairman Mao's portrait, and the representatives under the stage shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" Feng Xiuying tearfully recounted the experience of being persecuted by imperialist elements within the Catholic Church during the rule of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries, which resulted in her suffering from waist and leg pain and becoming disabled. She said: "Today, Chairman Mao is my parent, who gives me justice, and I dare to speak." She hoped that the Catholics would respond to all the calls of the government and follow Chairman Mao forever.
    The representatives also realized that now that the Catholic representative conference has been convened, this is only the beginning of the struggle; it is necessary to continue to deepen the reform movement and completely remove the imperialist elements from the Chinese Catholic Church. In their speeches, they successively demanded the rapid establishment of the "Beijing Catholic Reform Committee." Wang Yuxiang, representative of the Wangfuma Catholic Church, said: "We feel that the Catholic reform movement in Beijing needs a general leading body, so we ask the conference to immediately establish the 'Beijing Catholic Reform Committee,' so that our reform work can achieve more and greater victories." Jing Manyun, representative of the Fu Jen Church district, said: "All of our Catholics in the Fu Jen district ask to quickly establish a unified leadership reform organization. We firmly support it, obey it, and thoroughly eliminate the imperialist elements in the church!"
    Those who spoke at the conference also included Du Enlong, representative of Guang'anmen Catholic Church, Song Jingshan, Catholic priest of Fu Jen Church, Meng Huanyu, priest of Zhaodengyu Road Catholic Church, Jia Shoushan, representative of Beitang Church, Chen Mian, representative of Catholic believers in the Second District, Dong JingSan, seventy-three-year-old Catholic believer of Nantang Church, Shi Guozhi, representative of Dongtang Church, Jin Hongdao, representative of Nangangzi Catholic Church, Li Junwu, Vicar General of the Beijing Diocese, Shi Wenkui, representative of Beitang Church, and Lu Jianru, representative of Dongjiaominxiang Catholic Church.
    In the afternoon of the 17th, the meeting passed the "Resolution on Continuing to Deepen the Reform Movement," and elected 35 members of the city-wide reform committee, including Jia Zhenmin and Wang Longguo. The Beijing Catholic Reform Committee was established in warm applause.
    As soon as the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee was established, it received support and endorsement from Catholics and all aspects of the city. Representatives of the Catholic Fu Jen Church District and Xitang Church District, representatives of the Fu Jen University Labor Union, and representatives of Beijing Christianity all presented flags and speeches to the committee on the spot.
    In warm applause, the meeting finally passed the "Declaration of the Establishment of the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee" and the "Salute Telegram to Chairman Mao." At four o'clock in the afternoon, this historically significant representative conference of Beijing Catholicism concluded successfully in shouts of slogans. (By Yu Zhuzuo)

    北京市天主教革新委员会昨成立
    与会代表激愤控诉帝国主义者利用宗教侵略中国的罪行
    决心深入开展革新运动彻底肃清教会中的帝国主义分子
    【本报讯】北京市天主教革新代表会议于十六、十七两日在辅仁大学礼堂举行，成立了北京市天主教革新委员会。
    出席这个革新代表会议的代表有四百九十名，他们有史以来第一次聚集一堂，控诉帝国主义分子利用宗教侵略中国的罪行，商讨北京市天主教革新运动如何继续深入。
    十六日上午，会议开始。北京市天主教各堂革新委员会主任联席会的代表张英魁，报告革新运动的经过，略称：我们北京市天主教的自治、自养、自传革新运动，是从今年五月开始的。四个月来，我们广大的爱国教友经过学习、控诉和斗争，并且得到各界同胞的赞助，终于使我们的革新运动普遍地发展起来了。到现在为止，参加我们革新运动的天主教教友和神甫，人数已占全市教友的绝大多数。这是我们革新运动的胜利，是我们中国天主教从帝国主义的魔爪中解脱出来的胜利。
    中央人民政府文化教育委员会宗教事务处何成湘处长到会讲话。他指出：北京市天主教的自立革新运动，从下层广大教徒中发动群众，分区组织学习小组和革新委员会，然后在这基础上扩大建立全市性的革新委员会。这样做是对的，因为这使自立革新运动具有比较稳固的群众基础。对全国天主教的革新运动讲起来，这是一个很好的经验。全国都应该吸取这个经验。他号召天主教徒要更积极地参加祖国的各项爱国运动；并提高警惕，粉碎帝国主义分子的破坏阴谋，澈底完成天主教的革新运动。
    下午，吴晗副市长亲自到会讲话，并接受大会向市人民政府的献旗。他的讲话着重说明人民政府的宗教政策和教徒们应如何发扬爱国主义精神。他号召全体到会代表团结全体教友，在反对帝国主义的爱国旗帜下，在共同纲领的基础上，把天主教革新运动彻底完成，和全国人民一道把我们伟大祖国建设得更好。
    十六日下午和十七日上午为大会发言。发言的有各教堂教友代表与司铎、修士等二十三人。在发言中，代表们纷纷控诉了天主教内帝国主义分子及其走狗的罪行。东交民巷天主堂代表张守智、魏染胡同天主堂代表陆端生、小经厂天主堂代表南勉之、回照寺天主堂代表甘鑫泉等都控诉了天主教内与中国人民为敌的反动组织“圣母军”的罪恶事实，如散布反动谣言，不准教徒看进步书籍和人民日报，煽惑教徒反对中国共产党和人民政府，为美蒋匪帮搜集情报，禁止青年和儿童教徒入青年团和少年儿童队等。张守智沉痛地控诉他的当汉奸、特务的父亲张翰翔。他说，他的反动父亲是“圣母军”北京分会会长，假借教会势力掠夺农民财产，成为占有数十顷土地的大地主；在抗战期间曾勾结日寇杀害革命干部。过去在他父亲长期蒙蔽下，他一直不知道有祖国。他说：“他不是我的父亲，而是我们的敌人，我坚决要求人民政府严厉惩办他！我现在觉悟了，我一定要作一个真正的中国人，决心把革新运动搞好！”过去被骗加入了“圣母军”的十六岁的陆端生，揭露了“圣母军”破坏抗美援朝运动的情形，他决心退出那个反动组织，并要求政府取缔“圣母军”。长辛店天主教堂代表王龙国控诉披着神甫外衣的汉奸恶霸李德镜的罪恶。他说，李德镜倚仗日本宪兵的势力，欺压教友、霸占妇女，并毒打他的哥哥，使他的哥哥神智不清，后来被火车轧死了。解放以后，李德镜仍继续与人民为敌，散布谣言，散发反动文件，并私设电台，私藏枪枝、子弹等。仁慈堂教友蔺武才和蜜敏华，哭诉她们过去亲身在挂着“仁慈”招牌的仁慈堂内过的非人的生活，和帝国主义分子的修女们虐杀中国孤儿的惨无人道的罪行。有三个工人教友被强迫替他们埋的死人就有两千四百多个。蔺武才的四岁的小妹妹，也被帝国主义分子强迫着劳动。孩子们吃不饱，只好吃树上掉下来的槐树豆。蜜敏华的母亲也在仁慈堂内被帝国主义分子折磨死了。在她们控诉时，台下许多代表都在擦眼泪，他们愤怒地高呼：“为我们祖国被害的儿童报仇！”“肃清教会恶霸分子！”“打倒帝国主义！”
    代表们认识到：这次大会，是中国天主教有史以来第一次真正的教友的代表会议，这是中国共产党和毛主席英明领导解放了全中国的结果。他们在发言中纷纷表示感谢共产党和毛主席。清河镇堂代表冯伯那、辅仁堂代表冯秀英、西堂代表江月珠在讲话中，提到感谢毛主席时。都转过身去向毛主席的画像深深地鞠躬，台下代表就高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”冯秀英哭诉她过去在日本鬼子和国民党反动派统治时，受天主教内帝国主义分子迫害得下了腰疼、腿疼的疾病因而残废的经过。她说：“今天，毛主席是我的父母，给我作主，我敢说话了。”她希望教友们响应政府的一切号召，永远跟着毛主席走。
    代表们还认识到：现在天主教的代表会议是召开了，但这还只是斗争的开始；必须继续深入开展革新运动，把帝国主义分子彻底从中国天主教会内清除出去。他们在发言中纷纷要求迅速成立“北京市天主教革新委员会”。王驸马天主堂代表王玉祥说：“我们觉得北京市天主教的革新运动需要有一个总的领导机构，所以我们要求大会立即成立‘北京市天主教革新委员会’，这样，才能使我们的革新工作取得更多更大的胜利。”辅仁堂区代表景曼云说：“我们全体辅仁区教友要求赶快成立统一领导革新的机构，我们坚决拥护它，听从它，彻底把教会中的帝国主义分子肃清！”
    在大会上发言的，还有广安门天主堂代表杜恩隆、辅仁本堂神辅宋静山、赵登禹路天主堂神甫孟环禺、北堂代表贾寿山、第二区天主教教友代表陈绵、南堂七十三岁老教友董敬三、东堂代表师国芝、南岗子天主堂代表金宏道、北京教区副主教李君武、北堂代表史文奎、东交民巷天主堂代表卢建如等。
    十七日下午，会议通过“关于继续深入展开革新运动的决议”、选举出全市革新委员会委员贾振民、王龙国等三十五名，北京市天主教革新委员会在热烈的掌声中成立了。
    北京市天主教革新委员会一成立就受到全市天主教徒和各方面的支持和拥护，天主教辅仁堂区及西堂区代表、辅仁大学工会代表、北京基督教代表纷纷当场向该会献旗、献词。
    在热烈的掌声中，会议最后通过“北京市天主教革新委员会成立宣言”和“向毛主席致敬电”。下午四时，北京天主教这一具有历史意义的代表会议就在欢呼口号声中圆满闭幕了。（于诸左）
