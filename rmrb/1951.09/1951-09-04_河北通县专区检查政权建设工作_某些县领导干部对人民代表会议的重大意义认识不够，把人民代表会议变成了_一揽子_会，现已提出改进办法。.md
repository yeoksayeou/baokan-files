    Tongxian Special District, Hebei Province, Inspects Political Power Construction Work
    Some County Leaders Lack Sufficient Understanding of the Great Significance of the People's Representative Conference, Turning It into an "All-in-One" Meeting; Improvement Measures Have Now Been Proposed.
    The Tongxian Special Commissioner's Office of Hebei Province held a county magistrate meeting in early August to review the implementation of the People's Representative Conference system.
    Throughout the special district, each county has generally convened three to five People's Representative Conferences from last year to the present. Each conference discussed the issues most closely related to the interests of the people at the time and place, and indeed played a significant role in strengthening the connection between the People's Government and people from all walks of life and promoting various tasks. However, because some cadres (including leading cadres) lacked sufficient understanding of the great significance of the People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses, they turned the People's Representative Conferences into "all-in-one" meetings, with more cadres attending as observers than representatives attending. During the conference discussions, cadres spoke more and representatives spoke less. The meeting format was that the higher-ups spoke and the lower-ups listened, without fully developing the spirit of democracy. Some cadres mistakenly believed that holding a cadre meeting was easier than holding a People's Representative Conference, fearing trouble, so they did not convene People's Representative Conferences on schedule. Some regarded convening People's Representative Conferences as a good way to promote work and complete tasks, without recognizing that this is our fundamental national system and must be convened on schedule. Some mistakenly believed that People's Representative Conferences were for upper-level figures, so there was some formalism. When discussing issues, there was a lack of a serious spirit of discussion. Some believed that to realize working-class leadership, they must "take over everything." In addition, some village cadres and representatives had an unclear understanding of the powers of the representatives, which affected unity. For example, some village cadres suspected that representatives would report their shortcomings to the county leadership comrades, so they adopted an antagonistic attitude towards the representatives. When some representatives returned to the village to convey the resolutions of the meeting, the village cadres would say: "You brought back the task, you handle it yourself!" However, there were also individual representatives who were arrogant and conceited, and after returning to the village, they randomly picked on the village cadres.
    After the county magistrate meeting's review and discussion, everyone believed that it was necessary to hold the People's Representative Conferences well, and the following points should be done well: (1) Organize cadres at all levels to deeply study documents related to the construction of democratic political power, criticize all incorrect understandings of the People's Representative Conferences, and improve their ideological level. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct propaganda to the broad masses of the people so that everyone has a correct understanding of the People's Representative Conferences and establishes a sense of being the masters of the country.
        (2) Each meeting should be fully prepared, and the issues to be resolved should be printed and distributed to each representative in advance so that the representatives have sufficient time to consider and collect opinions from the masses. (3) The proposals should be collected in advance and reviewed one by one by the proposal review committee, and special explanations should be given at the meeting. Major issues that should be discussed should be handed over to the representatives for discussion and resolution. (4) After the meeting, county and district cadres should be well organized to assist the representatives in conveying the resolutions. (5) The election of representatives should be serious and earnest, overcoming all formalism or sloppiness. The masses should be mobilized in advance for full deliberation. Women representatives can be elected through women's organizations. (6) Establish a standing committee in a practical manner, set up full-time cadres, establish regular work, and strengthen contact with representatives. In addition, everyone believed that: the land reform work in the entire district has been completed, the masses have their own organizations, and their political awareness has been raised. In the autumn or winter of this year, the People's Representative Conferences of all circles in each county can exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress to elect county magistrates and government committees.

    河北通县专区检查政权建设工作
    某些县领导干部对人民代表会议的重大意义认识不够，把人民代表会议变成了“一揽子”会，现已提出改进办法。
    河北省通县专署在八月初召开了一次县长会议，检查了人民代表会议制度的执行情形。
    全专区从去年到现在，各县的人民代表会议普遍召开了三次到五次。每次会议都讨论了当时当地与人民利益关系最大的问题，对加强人民政府与各界人民的联系，推动各种工作，确实起了很大的作用。可是因为有些干部（包括领导干部在内）对各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会的重大意义认识不够，使人民代表会议变成了“一揽子”会，列席的干部比出席的代表还多。在会议讨论时，干部发言多，代表发言少。会议方式是上边讲下边听，没有充分发挥民主精神。有的干部错误地认为开人民代表会议不如干部会好开，怕麻烦，就不按期召开人民代表会议；有的把开人民代表会议看成是推动工作完成任务的好办法，没有认识到这是我们根本的国家制度，必须按期召开；有的错误地认为人民代表会议是给上层人物开的，所以有些形式主义。在讨论问题时，就缺乏认真讨论的精神；有的认为要想实现工人阶级领导，就必须“包办”。另外，有些村干部和代表对代表的职权认识不清，影响了团结。如有的村干部怀疑代表向县的领导同志反映他们的缺点，因此对代表采取对立态度。有的代表回村传达会议决议时，村干部就说：“你领来的任务，你个人办吧！”但也有个别代表自高自大，回村后乱挑村干部的眼。
    经过县长会议的检查与讨论，大家认为必须开好各界人民代表会议，应做好以下几点：（一）组织各级干部深入学习有关民主政权建设的文件，批判一切对各界人民代表会议不正确的认识，提高思想水平。同时要向广大人民进行宣传，使每个人对人民代表会议都有正确认识，树立起主人翁的思想。
        （二）每次会议要有充分的准备，事先把要解决的问题印发给每个代表，以便代表有充分的考虑和搜集群众意见的时间。（三）事先要把提案搜集好，由提案审查委员会一件一件审查，在会上作专门的交代。应讨论的重大问题，交代表讨论解决。（四）会后要好好组织县区干部协助代表传达决议。（五）选举代表要严肃认真，克服一切形式主义或马虎现象。事先要发动群众进行充分的酝酿。妇女代表可通过妇女团体去选举。（六）切实建立起常务委员会，设专职干部，建立起经常工作，加强与代表的联系。另外，大家认为：全区土地改革工作已经完成，群众有了自己的组织，提高了政治觉悟，在今年秋天或冬天，各县各界人民代表会议可以代行人民代表大会职权，选举县长和政府委员会。
