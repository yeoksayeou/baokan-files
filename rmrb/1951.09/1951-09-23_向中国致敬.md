    Homage to China
    By Pablo Neruda – China, for a long time, the image we saw of you was merely the one Westerners deliberately painted for themselves: you were so old, so withered, perpetually impoverished, an empty rice bowl, at the gate of an ancient temple. In the old China, blood was smeared on the walls, soldiers everywhere, coming and going, they robbed you as if entering a house without an owner. To the world, you were a peculiar flower covered in dust. At the temple gate, you held your empty bowl, watching us with your aged eyes. In Buenos Aires, portraits of you were sold, specially drawn for "educated" ladies. But in conferences, your marvelous voice suddenly appeared like a light long buried, in a flash. Everyone knew a smattering of your dynasties, they pursed their lips speaking of the Ming Dynasty, of porcelain, as if biting into a waxberry. They wanted us to believe that you were an uninhabited land, a country where only the clear wind blew into ancient temples, whispering and humming, entering the mountains and forests. They wanted us to believe that you were asleep, in a deep slumber, never to awaken. You were that "mysterious country," incomprehensible, profound and abstruse, a begging mother, wearing tattered silks. But, from each of your ports, sailed ship after ship laden with goods; and adventurers also sneaked in from there, vying for your wealth: minerals, ivory, followed by scheming, cruel exploitation, extortion, huge ships carrying away your blood, sweat, and marrow. But the world has changed dramatically. That portrait of your past is completely incorrect. Your aged dignity is beautiful, but no longer satisfies us. The Soviet flag flies in the wind, kissed by the smoke of gunfire. Truth penetrates the hearts of the people. Ah, China, we need you, across the barriers of the ocean, we hope to hear the singing of the wind on your land, now, it no longer whispers on the desolate roads.
    
    Mao Zedong appeared on China’s vast and endlessly troubled land, we saw his shoulders bathed in the sunlight of dawn. From distant America, our people listen to every ripple emanating from that calm mind. His footsteps advanced northward, directly to Yan'an, his clothes covered in dust, he advanced with dignity. From that time on, we saw millions of people rising on China's desolate land, young and old, they emitted innocent smiles.
            We saw life. You are no longer that ancient land, you are no longer the bright moon by the water, shining on the ruins of ghostly ancient buildings. Behind every rock lies a person, each person with a gun in their hand. Your people, though eating wild grass, without grain or water, work day and night, so that dawn may be born.
    
    You are not some mysterious jade of the Celestial Dynasty. You are like us, a pure and simple people, some wearing shoes, some barefoot, peasants and soldiers, rising from all directions, to defend their sacred rights, we see their faces are like ours, their working hands are also like our hands, we see them marching on the avenue. Your names are like ours, though yours are monosyllabic, they are as simple as the names of people everywhere. You march in unison, in the same direction, advancing with Mao Zedong, across the desert, across the snow, guarding the budding of spring.
    
    That tall giant grows step by step, boundless rice paddies, land, buildings, it attracts the attention of people all over the world: "How did you grow so fast, my brother!" But the enemy is also watching you. In New York, in London, in dark banks, people's pockets are fattened by blood. They are fearful, they discuss, suspecting each other: "Who is this?" That calm giant does not answer, he gazes at the vast and solid land, one hand eliminating sorrow and suffering, one hand holding the red wheat ears of tomorrow. He gazes at everything born of the earth, his face glowing, unfolding a smile, rippling like wind blowing through wheat waves, like golden stars shining in the blood shed by heroes, your national flag flying in the sky.
    
    Now, people all over the world clearly see that your vast land has been unified and united, you are as swift and powerful as a hurricane. Your sharp axe cuts down traitors, the light of victory pierces the enemy, ah, victorious republic, stretch out your arms to embrace the entire country, to lay the foundation for your lasting peace! On the other side of the ocean, gangs of bandits come running, they want to rob, they will surely receive their just deserts. They fly to Taiwan, bound by chains, to feed that nest of scorpions. They run to Korea, creating bloodshed, misery, suffering, and destruction, this is their usual trick: broken walls, tragically dead women. But, suddenly one day, came your strong and unparalleled volunteers, to carry out their mission for the sacred friendship of mankind. From ocean to ocean, from plain to snowy mountain, all the nations of the world look at you, ah, China! They say: "What a strong brother has appeared among us!" The people of the Americas bend over to cultivate in the ditches, hot machines control and surround them. The poor people of the tropics, the heroic miners of Bolivia, the workers on the vast lands of Brazil, and the shepherds of Patagonia [Note], they all look at you, the people's China, they all salute you! I, like them, send this kiss to your forehead. You are no longer that picture specially drawn for us in the past, your image is no longer a poor woman beside an ancient temple, but a strong warrior loved by the people, one hand holding the weapon of victory, one hand embracing a crescent-shaped bundle of grain, the fate of many nations resting on your shoulders.

    向中国致敬
    巴勃罗·聂鲁达一中国啊，长久以来，我们所看到的你的形象，只是西方人故意为他们自己描绘的：你是那样的衰老，你是那样的凋残，永远的贫困，一只空了的饭碗，在一所古庙门口。从前，在旧中国，鲜血涂在墙上，到处是兵士，出出进进，他们抢劫你，好像走进一所没有主人的房屋。对于世界，你是一朵蒙着尘土的奇花。在庙宇门口，你拿着你的空碗，用你的衰老的眼光注视着我们。在布宜诺斯·艾利斯，出售着你的肖像，那是为了“有教养的”太太们特别绘制的。可是在会议上，你的奇妙的语音忽然像长久被埋藏的光，一霎那出现。谁都一知半解地知道一些你们的历朝历代，他们抿着嘴唇说着明朝，说着瓷器，好像嘴里咬着一颗杨梅那样。他们要叫我们相信：你是一片无人的土地，一个这样的国家：在那儿只有清风吹进古庙，呜咽低吟，传入山林。他们要叫我们相信，你是睡着，作着沉沉的梦，永远不醒。你是那“神秘之国”，无法理解，深奥玄妙，一个乞食的母亲，穿着褴褛的绫锦。但是，从你的每一个港口，驶出了一艘一艘满载货物的船只；而冒险家们也从那里偷偷进来，争夺你的财富：矿产、象牙，接着是施展阴谋，残酷地剥削，榨取，巨大的船只将你的血汗骨髓捆载以去。但是世界发生了巨变。你的过去的那幅肖像已经完全不正确。你的衰老的庄严是美丽的，但已经不能满足我们。那苏维埃的旗帜在风中飞扬，受着炮火硝烟的亲吻。真理深入人心。啊，中国，我们需要你，越过重洋的阻隔，我们希望听到你土地上的风的歌唱，现在，它不再在旷野的道路上低吟。二毛泽东出现在中国的纵横辽阔的遭受无数次灾难的土地上，我们看见他的肩膀沐浴在黎明的阳光里。从遥远的美洲，我们的人民倾听着那平静的脑海中荡漾起来的每一个波浪。他的脚步向北方行进，直达延安，他的衣服满是尘土，他庄严地前进。从那时候起，我们看见中国的荒凉的大地上崛起了千百万人民，青年和老人，他们发出了天真的微笑。
            我们看见了生命。你不再是那古老的土地，你不再是那水边的明月，照在幽灵似的古代建筑的废墟上。每一块岩石后面伏着一个人，每一个人手里一枝枪。你的人民虽然吃着野草，没粮没水，但日以继夜地工作，为了使黎明诞生。三你不是什么天朝的神秘的翠玉。你就像我们一样，是纯洁朴素的人民，有的穿着鞋，有的光着脚，农民和士兵，从四面八方起来，保卫自己的神圣权利，我们看见他们的面容跟我们一样，他们的劳动的手，也跟我们的手一样，我们看见他们行进在大道上。你们的名字跟我们的一样，虽则你们的是单音，但它们跟各地人民的名字一样朴素。你们步伐一致，方向相同，和毛泽东一起前进，越过沙漠，越过雪地卫护着春天的萌芽。四那高大的巨人一步一步长大，无边无际的稻田、土地、建筑，它引起了全世界人民的注目：“你怎么长大得这样快，我的兄弟！”但是敌人也在望着你们。在纽约，在伦敦，在阴暗的银行里，人们的口袋被鲜血所养肥。他们恐惧，他们议论，相互猜疑：“这是谁？”那镇静的巨人不回答，他瞭望着广大的坚实的土地，一只手消灭了悲伤和苦难，一只手抱着明天的红色的麦穗。他瞭望着大地所生的一切，他的脸上容光焕发，展开一个微笑，像风吹拂麦浪似地荡漾，像金色的星星在英雄所流的鲜血里闪光，你们的国旗在天空飘扬。五现在，全世界人民都清楚看见，你的广大的国土已经统一团结，你像飓风一般迅猛有力。你的利斧砍向奸徒，胜利的光刺向敌人，啊，胜利的共和国，伸出你的手臂拥抱整个国土，为你的永久和平奠基！在海洋的另一边，跑来匪帮，他们想来抢劫，他们一定会得到应得的报应。他们飞向被锁链捆绑的台湾，去喂养那蝎子的巢穴。他们跑到朝鲜，制造流血，悲惨，痛苦和破坏，这是他们惯做的勾当：断墙残垣，惨死的妇女。但是，突然有一天，来到了你的坚强无比的志愿军，为了人类的神圣的友谊执行他们的任务。从海洋到海洋，从平原到雪山，世界各民族一起望着你，啊，中国！他们说：“我们当中出现了一个多么坚强的兄弟
  啊！”美洲的人民弯着腰在田沟里耕作，炽热的机器控制着，包围着他们。热带的贫苦人民，玻利维亚的英勇的矿工，宽广的巴西土地上的工人，还有巴塔冈尼亚〔注〕的牧羊人，他们都注视着你，人民的中国，他们都向你致敬！我和他们一样把这个吻送向你的前额。你再也不是过去那幅特别为我们而描绘的图画，你的形象再也不是古庙旁的一个贫苦的妇女，而是一个强壮的为人民所热爱的战士，一手握着胜利的武器，一手怀抱一束新月形的谷穗，许多民族的命运寄托在你的肩膀。
