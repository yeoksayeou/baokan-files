    Brief Commentary on Party Life

    Good Things Turned Into Bad Things

    Rural insurance is a measure to stimulate production and protect the interests of farmers. In the Southwest region, insurance programs have developed considerably in various places and are welcomed by farmers. However, due to the lack of strong supervision and leadership from Party organizations in various places, some inappropriate phenomena have been discovered. In some rural areas, insurance programs have become a burden for farmers. For example, after wooden boats in Guizhou were insured, freight rates became more expensive than those of automobiles. Some personnel in insurance companies have a simple "money-making" mentality, disregarding the actual and vital interests of the people and applying capitalist methods to the countryside. This not only damages the developing people's insurance事业 but also undermines the prestige of the Party and the government among the farmers. This deserves serious attention.

    In addition, some staff members apply urban work methods indiscriminately to the countryside, which is also incorrect. For example, patriotic savings are banking business in the city, and buyers of savings certificates are very enthusiastic, but in the rural areas of Southern Sichuan, it has become an administratively assigned "patriotic savings." This phenomenon is particularly serious in several counties.

    From this, it can be seen that the matter was originally a good thing, but it was turned into a bad thing by some cadres with erroneous ideological styles. The Southwest Region is currently correcting the above-mentioned phenomenon. The above-mentioned deviations should also attract the attention of cadres in other regions handling rural insurance and savings businesses. Party leading organs must supervise rural insurance work, savings businesses, and other work, and resolutely correct all deviations.

    党的生活简评
    好事情却做成了坏事情
    农村保险事业是刺激生产、保护农民利益的措施之一。在西南地区，各地保险事业已经有相当发展，受到农民的欢迎；但由于各地党的组织缺乏有力的监督和领导，已发现有某些不适当现象。在某些农村地区，保险事业成了农民的负担。例如贵州木船实行保险后，运费比汽车还贵。保险公司的某些人员有着单纯“赚钱”思想，不顾人民切身的实际利益，把资本主义的一套办法运用于农村，这不仅损害了正在发展着的人民保险事业，而且破坏了党和政府在农民中的威信，这是值得十分注意的。
    另外，有些工作人员把城市工作方法乱用于农村，这也是不对的。如爱国储蓄，在城市是银行业务，购买储蓄券者十分踊跃，到了川南农村却成了行政摊派的“爱国储蓄”了。这种现象在几个县内表现得特别严重。
    由此可见，事情本来是件好事情，却被某些存在着错误思想作风的干部做成了坏事情。西南区对上述现象正纠正中。上述偏向同样应引起其他地区办理农村保险事业以及储蓄业务的干部注意。党的领导机关一定要监督农村保险工作以及储蓄业务等等的其他工作，坚决纠正一切偏向。
