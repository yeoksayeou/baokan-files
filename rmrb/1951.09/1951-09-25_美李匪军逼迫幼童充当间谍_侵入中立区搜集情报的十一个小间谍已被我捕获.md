Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," reported from Kaesong on the 22nd: Today, eleven ragged children are sitting in the police station here – a group of people recently dragged into the United Nations spy agency. They are now in extreme juvenile sorrow, crying so much that people can't bear to look at them. One child kept saying, "They will treat my little brother the same way."

Two weeks ago, these children were still shining shoes or selling cigarettes on the streets of Seoul. One day, a South Korean soldier got out of a truck and said to them: "I want to take twenty-five children to an American military camp thirty miles away, where you will have a good business." So twenty-five children squeezed into the truck, but after traveling thirty miles, the truck continued to move forward and crossed the Imjin River. Only then did these children realize they had been deceived. When they arrived at the intelligence team headquarters of the Syngman Rhee army, someone told them that they had to sneak into the area near Kaesong to collect intelligence, or they would be shot. Their clothes and cigarettes were confiscated, and they were told to put on tattered clothes. They underwent ten days of "training," during which they were taught about tanks, armies, compasses, etc., and told that if they were arrested, they must pretend to be beggars, fishing children, or pretend to be playing. During the training, ten children managed to escape.

Three days ago, this group of children received final instructions. One child had to go to Kaesong alone, and the other children were sent in pairs to places further north. They were taught to remember that they belonged to the "First Detachment, First Branch of the 4863rd Unit" so that they could be identified when they returned. The first child crossed the boundary into the neutral zone just after dark, and was questioned by vigilant sentries. He could not give satisfactory answers to the sentries' questions, so he confessed the whole story. Within a few hours, the other ten children were also caught. The youngest of them was only twelve years old, and the oldest was no more than fifteen. The confessions made by these children separately were all the same; and admitted that their mission was to collect intelligence on the movement and transportation of troops, tanks, and ammunition, and report to the team headquarters. These children can no longer be sent back, because the Li puppet army will definitely kill them. The police in Kaesong told them that they would be sent to schools in North Korea to study.

This incident is another intrusion into the neutral zone by the United Nations forces. This time, they cruelly tore these children away from their families, which is an inhumane and immoral act, and a typical example of what the US military and the Li puppet army are doing here. Can the United Nations, an organization that talks highly of freedom and human rights, be proud of forcing children to be spies?

### 美李匪军逼迫幼童充当间谍  侵入中立区搜集情报的十一个小间谍已被我捕获

    美李匪军逼迫幼童充当间谍
    侵入中立区搜集情报的十一个小间谍已被我捕获
    【新华社二十四日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十二日自开城报道：今天在此地的警察派出所里坐着十一个衣衫褴褛的小孩子——最近被拉入联合国间谍机关的一批人。他们这时正陷入少年的极端悲哀之中，哭得让人们不忍看下去。有一个孩子不断地说：“他们也将同样地对待我的小弟弟。”
    两个星期以前，这群小孩子还在汉城市街上擦皮鞋或卖香烟。有一天，一个南朝鲜军人从一辆卡车上走下来，对他们说：“我要带二十五个孩子到三十里以外的一个美国兵营去，你们在那里会有一笔生意好做。”于是有二十五个孩子挤进了这辆卡车，但是到了三十里外的地方，卡车仍然向前行驶，并且开过了临津江，这些孩子们这才知道他们受了骗。到了李承晚军情报队队部，有人对他们说，他们必须潜入开城附近地区来搜集情报，否则就枪毙他们。他们的衣服和香烟等物品都被没收了，并且叫他们换上破烂的衣服。他们受了十天的“训练”，在那个期间有人教他们关于坦克、军队、指南针等的知识，并且告诉他们，假若被捕的话，他们必须假装是乞丐、打渔的小孩或者装作正在游戏的样子。在受训期间，有十个孩子设法逃走了。
    三天以前，这一批孩子得到了最后的指示。有一个孩子必须单独到开城，另外的孩子是两人一组，被派到更北的地方去。有人教他们记牢他们属于“第四八六三部队第一支队第一分遣队”，以便在他们回来的时候能够被识别。第一个孩子在天刚黑的时候越界进入中立区，受到警觉的哨兵盘查，他不能对哨兵的问题给予满意的答复，于是把整个的经过全盘吐露出来了。在几小时以内，另外的十个小孩也被抓起来了，他们之中最小的只有十二岁，最大的也不过十五岁。这些孩子们分别所作的供词全都相同；并且承认他们的任务是搜集关于军队、坦克及军火的调动与运输的情报，报告队部。这些孩子都不能再被送回去，因为李伪军是一定会把他们弄死的。开城的警察告诉他们说：将把他们送到北朝鲜学校去读书。
    这个事件是联合国军方面又一次侵入中立区。这一次他们残忍地使这些儿童生生地脱离他们的家庭，这是一种没有人性的不道德的行为，是美军和李伪军在此地所作所为的典型事例。难道联合国这个高谈自由和人权的组织能够以逼迫幼童当间谍而自豪吗？
