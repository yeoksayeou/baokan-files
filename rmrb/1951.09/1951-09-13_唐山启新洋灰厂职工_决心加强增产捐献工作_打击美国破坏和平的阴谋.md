    Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory Workers
    Resolve to Strengthen Production Increase and Donation Work
    to Strike at America's Conspiracy to Sabotage Peace
To the Editor:
    We, all the workers of the Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory, feel boundless anger at the shameless behavior of American imperialism in sabotaging the Korean armistice talks. Everyone unanimously expresses that we will strengthen the movement to increase production and make donations to consolidate national defense, support the front lines, and strike at the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.
    The workers of our factory have successively formulated plans to increase production and make donations, including them in the patriotic pledges. For example, the five groups of cement warehouse workers Zhu Dongyuan, Xu Zhongwu, Zhang Kexin, Liu Jinming, and Zhang Shu held a meeting on the morning of August 30 before starting work. At that time, the workers spontaneously donated more than 4.5 million yuan in cash. They revised the patriotic pledge, supplementing the content of increasing production and making donations. The original patriotic pledge stipulated donating one day's wages each month; this time, it was also decided to donate 20 percent of the monthly bonus for exceeding production quotas. They also decided to pour 10 percent more cement or load more cement cars after completing the daily task of pouring cement to increase production and make donations. The workers all said, "We must step up the fight against America and aid Korea, consolidate national defense, and give American imperialism a heavy blow!"
    Manufacturing group worker An Ruiqing said when he received his bonus for exceeding the quota in June and July, "This was brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I will always remember it in my heart. To defend this fruit of victory, we should step up support for the Volunteer Army and consolidate national defense. I have decided to donate 50 percent of my monthly bonus for exceeding the quota, starting in June."

    唐山启新洋灰厂职工
    决心加强增产捐献工作
    打击美国破坏和平的阴谋编辑同志：
    我们唐山启新洋灰厂全体职工对美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战谈判的无耻行为，感到无比的愤怒。大家一致表示要加强增产捐献运动，来巩固国防、支援前线，打击美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    我厂职工们已纷纷订出增产捐献计划，把它列入爱国公约中。如洋灰栈朱东元、许仲武、张克信、刘金铭、张树五个小组，在八月三十日早晨开工前，开了一次会。当时工友们就自动捐献了现款四十五万余元。他们修订了爱国公约，补充了增产捐献的内容。原来的爱国公约内订的是每月捐献一日工资；这次又决定要把每月超额奖金的百分之二十也捐献出来。他们又决定要多灌百分之十的洋灰，或在完成每天灌洋灰的任务后再多装洋灰车，来增产捐献。工友们都说：“咱们一定要加紧抗美援朝，巩固国防，给美帝国主义重重的打击！”
    制造组工友安瑞清在领到了六、七月的超额奖金时说：“这是共产党、毛主席带给我们的。我一定永远记在心里。我们要保卫这胜利果实，就应该加紧支援志愿军，巩固国防。我决定从六月份起，把每月超额奖金捐献百分之五十。”
