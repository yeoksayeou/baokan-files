Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 6th. A congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao from the Nanjing patriotic Catholics celebrating the victory in the struggle to expel the anti-imperialist Riberi: Respected Chairman Mao:

	We hereby report to you that the imperialist element Riberi, who has been weighing down on us for more than four years, has been ordered to be permanently expelled from the country by the Nanjing Military Control Commission. Our longing, and that of patriotic Catholics across the country, has been realized. How excited and grateful we are!

	All of us Catholics believe that this is a great victory in the anti-imperialist struggle within Catholicism, a major turning point for Catholics in nearly a century. The achievement of this victory, in addition to our own increased patriotic consciousness in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, is mainly due to the support of the broad masses of the people, the wise measures taken by the People's Government to safeguard national interests, and especially your ideological education in patriotism, which inspired us to advance victoriously! All of us Catholics express our heartfelt gratitude to you.

	All of us Catholics have further recognized from this struggle the imperialist conspiracy to use religion to invade China. Riberi was the most ferocious and insidious imperialist element. He shouted "supra-national," but actually engaged in espionage activities, organized the reactionary "Legion of Mary," and undermined the construction of the new China. Riberi kept saying "supra-political," but before liberation, he actively helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang carry out anti-people activities, and after liberation, he desperately incited Catholics to oppose the People's Government and tried to obstruct the patriotic movement of Catholics. We have deeply realized that the "supra-political" and "supra-national" touted by imperialist elements are merely a cover for carrying out counter-revolutionary activities.

	Now, although Riberi has been expelled, imperialist elements and their running dogs are still lurking inside the church, secretly carrying out sabotage activities, and the ideological influence of imperialism has not yet been eradicated among our Catholics. Therefore, our future tasks are still very arduous, and we must continue to heighten our vigilance and thoroughly eliminate imperialist elements and their ideological influence. But we firmly believe that under your wise leadership, the struggle of the Chinese people will always be victorious. Today, we patriotic Catholics in Nanjing held a celebration parade to expel Riberi, and all of us Catholics swore to you: We will definitely continue to strengthen patriotic education, resolutely fight against imperialist elements and their running dogs, eliminate the ideological toxins of imperialism, and do a good job in the Three-Self Reform Movement, to answer your love for us and the earnest expectations of the people of the whole country with our practical actions. We offer our highest respects!

    南京天主教徒电毛主席致敬
    【新华社南京六日电】南京市爱国天主教徒庆祝驱逐黎培里反帝斗争胜利大会致电毛主席致敬。电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们谨向您报告，压在我们头上四年多的帝国主义分子黎培里已由本市军管会下令永远驱逐出境了。我们和全国爱国教友的渴望实现了。我们是多么的兴奋和感激啊！
    我们全体教友都认为这是天主教中反帝国主义斗争的一大胜利，是近百年来天主教教友的大翻身。这个胜利的获得，除了我们自己在抗美援朝运动中爱国觉悟提高以外，主要是有赖于广大人民的支援，人民政府为维护国家利益的贤明措施，特别是您给我们的爱国主义思想教育，鼓舞了我们胜利前进！我们全体教友都对您表示衷心的感谢。
    我们全体教友都从这次斗争中，进一步认识了帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国的阴谋。黎培里就是最凶恶、最阴险的帝国主义分子。他口里喊着“超国家”，实际上进行间谍活动，组织反动的“圣母军”，破坏新中国的建设。黎培里口口声声说“超政治”，可是在解放以前，他是那样积极地帮助蒋介石匪帮进行反人民活动，而到解放以后，又拚命煽动天主教友反对人民政府，极力阻挠教友的爱国运动。我们已深深地认清了帝国主义分子所标榜的“超政治”、“超国家”，只不过是用来进行反革命活动的掩护而已。
    现在，黎培里虽然被驱逐了，但是帝国主义分子及其走狗，仍然潜伏在教会内部，暗中进行破坏活动，帝国主义的思想影响，在我们教友内还没有肃清。因此，我们今后的任务还很艰巨，还必须继续提高警惕，澈底肃清帝国主义分子及其思想影响。但是我们深信：在您的英明领导之下，中国人民的斗争永远是胜利的。今天，我们南京市爱国教友举行了驱逐黎培里的庆祝游行大会，我们全体教友向您宣誓：我们一定继续加强爱国主义教育，与帝国主义分子及其走狗进行坚决斗争，清除帝国主义的思想毒素，搞好三自革新运动，以我们的实际行动来回答您对我们的热爱和全国人民的殷望。敬致崇高的敬礼！
