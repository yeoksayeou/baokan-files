The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, are smoothly marching on the road of communist construction. The communist education of the working people is of decisive significance for accelerating our movement forward. The Party pays great attention to the promotion of Marxism-Leninism and the improvement of all ideological work.

In the arsenal of the Party used to lead ideological work, newspapers and periodicals occupy the most important position. The Bolshevik press is a powerful ideological weapon of the Party. Our newspapers and periodicals play a significant role in domestic socio-political life, in raising the socialist consciousness of the masses, and in the struggle to overcome the remnants of old ideas in people's minds.

The task of newspapers and periodicals, especially newspapers, in clarifying ideological issues is becoming increasingly important. The more widely and fully newspapers clarify ideological issues, the more they promote Marxism-Leninism, and the more they promote the prosperity of Soviet science, schools, literature, and art, the more powerful their impact on the masses will be. In order to successfully handle this most important responsibility, newspaper editorial departments should constantly be concerned with how Party organizations lead ideological work, and should be familiar with the life of scientific institutions, the life of universities and colleges, the life of middle schools and clubs, know what local publishing bureaus are publishing, what the theater programs are, and what literary and artistic workers' creative organizations are doing. The entire ideological work front should be within the newspaper's field of vision.

Unfortunately, many newspapers ignore this. The "Worker's Road Newspaper" in Smolensk province limits its activities to the clarification of current economic issues. Materials on ideological themes have disappeared from its pages. You cannot find articles by propagandists in the newspaper, nor vivid and interesting reports on the experience of the Party's political work and the life of cultural and educational organs. There are also serious shortcomings in the "Soviet Siberia Newspaper" in Novosibirsk province. This newspaper, published in the largest industrial and cultural center, hardly mentions the life of scientific research institutes and universities. In the newspaper, you cannot read about the activities of the provincial publishing bureau and the activities of local writers' organizations, theaters, and clubs.

It should be pointed out that even the central newspapers are studying the problems of ideological work less and less, irregularly, and superficially.

If a newspaper evades the clarification and study of ideological issues, it will not see the phenomena of ideological, political and cultural life, and will not fulfill its most important task. Such a newspaper cannot meet the growing demands of readers.

The broad and comprehensive clarification of ideological work in newspapers and periodicals is an inescapable matter. It requires newspaper workers to have appropriate cultivation and profound knowledge of things. This is why the responsibility of Party newspapers should be to constantly care about improving the political level and expanding the horizons of newspaper cadres.

Propagating Marxism-Leninism is the decisive condition for continuously improving ideological work and the basis for successfully solving the problem of the communist education of the working people. Millions of Party members and non-Party comrades are studying in political schools, study groups, or engaging in self-study. They, as well as propagandists, problem solvers, and speakers, are waiting for the newspaper's constant help. The central, republic, border area, and provincial newspapers should systematically publish articles by propagandists, answers to questions, the best speeches of propagandists, and answers to readers' questions.

In accordance with the Party's historic resolutions on ideological issues, newspapers and periodicals must fully promote the further development of Soviet literature. The people, the country, and the Party require literature to actively delve into all areas of our life, point out the high moral qualities of the Soviet people, and not only point out our present, but also reveal the future. Literature and art should help the Party and the government educate our people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, and should help educate the new generation to be brave people who believe in our cause, are not afraid of difficulties, and are prepared to overcome any obstacles.

Our newspapers should focus on maintaining a high degree of ideological content and Bolshevik Party spirit, and should wage a resolute and uncompromising struggle against all manifestations of bourgeois ideology, against political apathy and lack of ideological content. At the same time, some of our newspapers have made serious mistakes in clarifying ideological issues. For example, the "Red Ukraine Newspaper" of the Ukrainian Republic gave an incorrect evaluation of the opera "Bogdan Khmelnitsky" and did not notice the nationalistic tendencies in certain literary works. The "Socialist Kazakhstan Newspaper" of the Kazakh Republic also made mistakes in clarifying ideological issues.

Criticism and book reviews are a particularly important part of the newspaper's work on communist education. The editorial departments of republic, border area, and provincial newspapers should regularly publish book catalogs and articles on the most important literary works, and publish reviews of all publications of local publishing bureaus. It should be pointed out that the criticism and book reviews of many newspapers are unsatisfactory. The appearance of new book reviews is extremely accidental.

Newspapers should also systematically publish articles and reviews on new plays staged by local theaters. However, many newspapers rarely publish articles on drama. The theatrical essays and reviews that are published are still superficial and formulaic. These articles are often written by people who know little about art, and expert reviews of new plays are replaced by subjective and arbitrary reviews that do not correspond to the true meaning and level of the play.

Literature and art cannot develop without criticism. Criticism in newspapers and periodicals can help writers, playwrights, and theater workers to master the method of socialist realism, constantly improve their skills, and promote the creation of works with high ideological content and complete artistic value.

A newspaper editorial department can only successfully complete the task of clarifying ideological issues if it truly cares about expanding and consolidating its ties with Party activists, literary and artistic workers, and all Soviet intellectuals among the authors. Party newspapers should constantly bring newspapers into the struggle to further prosper socialist culture, turn the editorial department's attention to the Party's political and ideological issues, and truly turn newspapers into combat newspapers for mass political education.

Comrade Stalin taught that newspapers are the sharpest and most powerful weapon of our Party. Newspapers and periodicals have never completed such noble tasks in all of history as the Bolshevik newspapers and periodicals, and have never played such a social role. Bolshevik newspapers and periodicals are truly free, authentic, and principled newspapers and periodicals. Party organizations constantly improve the ideological level of newspapers and periodicals, which guarantees strengthening its role in the communist education of the masses and in the great cause of communist construction.

### 提高报刊在思想工作中的作用

    提高报刊在思想工作中的作用
    苏维埃人民在列宁——斯大林党的领导下，顺利地走着共产主义建设的道路。劳动人民的共产主义教育，对于加速我们运动前进有着决定性的意义。党对于马列主义的宣传，对于全部思想工作的提高，予以巨大的注意。
    在党用以领导思想工作的武库中，报刊占有最重要的地位。布尔什维克的报刊是党的强有力的思想武器。我们的报刊在国内社会政治生活中，在提高群众社会主义意识中，在争取克服人们意识中的残余的斗争中，均起着重大的作用。
    报刊，首先是报纸，在阐明思想问题方面的任务愈来愈加重了。报纸对思想问题阐明得愈广泛和愈充实，对马列主义的宣传做得愈多，愈能促进苏维埃科学，学校，文学和艺术的繁荣，那么它对群众的影响也就愈有力量。为了成功地处理这个最重要的责任，报纸编辑部应当经常地关心：党组织怎样领导思想工作，并且要熟悉科学机关的生活，高等学校的生活，中学校和俱乐部的生活，知道各地出版局出版的东西，剧院演奏节目怎样，文学和艺术工作者创作组织在做什么。全部思想工作战线应当在报纸的视野之内。
    可惜，许多报纸忽视了这个。斯摩棱斯克省的“工人道路报”，只用当前的一些经济问题的阐明把自己的活动范围限制起来。思想主题的材料从它的报面上消失了。你在报纸上碰不见宣传员的文章，党的政治工作经验和文化教育机关生活的生动的、有兴趣的通讯。新西伯利亚省的“苏维埃西伯利亚报”中也有严重的缺点。在最大的工业和文化中心区所出版的这张报纸中，关于科学研究院和高等学校的生活几乎一字未提。在报纸中不能读到关于省出版局活动的介绍和当地作家组织、剧院、俱乐部的生活的介绍。
    应当指出，甚至中央的报纸愈来愈少地，不正规地，浮浅地研究思想工作的问题。
    报纸如果逃避对思想问题的阐明与研究，就会看不见思想，政治与文化生活的现象，就不会完成自己最重要的任务。这样的报纸是不可能满足读者日益增长的要求的。
    报刊中广泛的和全面的阐明思想工作是一件不容推托的事情。它要求报纸工作者有适当的修养和对事物的深邃知识。这就是为什么党机关报的责任应当是不断关怀政治水平的提高和报纸干部视野的扩大。
    宣传马列主义就是不断提高思想工作的决定性条件，就是成功地解决劳动人民共产主义教育问题的基础。数以百万计的共产党员和非党同志在政治学校、学习小组里学习，或从事自学。他们以及宣传员、问题解答者、讲演者都等待着报纸的经常的帮助。中央的，共和国的，边区的以及省的报纸应当系统地发表宣传员的文章，问题解答，宣传员最好的演说和答读者问。
    依照党关于思想问题的历史性的决议，报刊要全力促进苏维埃文学的进一步发展。人民、国家、党要求文学积极地深入我们生活的全部领域，指出苏维埃人们的高度的道德品质，不仅指出我们的今天，而且也要揭示出明天来。文学和艺术应当帮助党和政府以苏维埃的爱国主义的精神教育我们人民，应当帮助把新一代教育成相信我们的事业，不怕困难，准备克服任何阻碍的勇敢的人。
    我们报纸应当专注地保持着高度的思想性，布尔什维克的党性，应当与资产阶级思想的一切表现、与不问政治和没有思想性作坚决的和不调协的斗争。同时，我们的某些报纸在阐明思想问题方面犯了严重的错误。如乌克兰共和国的“红乌克兰报”对歌剧“波格丹·赫美里茨基”曾予以不正确的评价，没有注意到某些文学作品中的民族主义的倾向。卡查赫共和国的“社会主义的卡查赫斯坦报”在阐明思想问题上也犯了错误。
    批评与图书评论是报纸关于共产主义教育工作的特殊重要部分。共和国，边区和省报的编辑部应当正规地发表书籍介绍目录和有关最重要的文学作品的文章，发表对地方出版局一切出版物的评论。应当指出，许多报纸的批评与图书评论是不能令人满意的。新书评论的出现是极偶然的。
    报纸也应当系统地登载对地方剧院上演的新剧的文章与评论。然而，许多报纸却很少发表关于戏剧的文章。所发表的戏剧论文与评论总还是浮浅与公式化的，这些文章时常是被一些对艺术懂得很少的人所写的，对新剧的内行评论被一些与该剧真正意义及水平不相吻合的，主观的和专断的评论代替了。
    文学和艺术没有批评就不能发展。报刊中的批评能够帮助作家，剧作家，剧院工作者去掌握社会主义现实主义的方法，不断提高技巧，促进创作具有高度思想性和完整艺术价值的作品。
    报纸编辑部只有在它真正关怀扩大与巩固自己与党积极分子中的、文学艺术工作者中和一切苏维埃知识分子中的作者的联系，才能成功地完成阐明思想问题的任务。党机关报应当经常地把报纸引入争取进一步繁荣社会主义文化的斗争中，把编辑部的注意力转向党的政治的、思想的问题方面，把报纸真正地变成群众政治教育的战斗机关报。
    斯大林同志教导说，报纸是我党最尖锐的，最强有力的武器。报刊在全部历史中还从未完成过像布尔什维克报刊这样高贵的任务，还从未起过这样的社会作用，布尔什维克报刊是真正自由的，真实的和原则的报刊。党组织不断地提高报刊的思想水平，便保证着加强它在群众的共产主义教育中，在共产主义建设的伟大事业中的作用。
