Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 15th: According to a TASS report from New York on September 13th, a grand demonstration and mass rally, attended by over 100,000 people, was recently held in Havana, the capital of Cuba, to protest the high cost of living and the Cuban government's inability to resolve the country's increasing economic difficulties.

    Speakers representing various political viewpoints delivered passionate speeches at the mass rally, attacking the government's corruption and incompetence and demanding the restoration of democratic freedoms in Cuba.

    Cuban police brutally attacked the rally. As a result, Rodriguez, the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Cuban Socialist People's Party, sacrificed his life. However, the rally continued and achieved great success.

    The Cuban Socialist People's Party distributed over 300,000 leaflets, putting forward a program for organizing a National Democratic Front, calling for the organization of a national united government to fight for peace, in order to solve Cuba's economic difficulties, which have been aggravated by Cuban President Socarrás's pursuit of a war policy.

    抗议古巴政府推行战争政策
    哈瓦那十万余人示威
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约十三日讯：古巴首都哈瓦那最近举行了有十万余人参加的盛大示威游行和群众集会，抗议生活费用的高涨以及古巴政府无法解决的该国日益增加的经济困难。
    代表各种政治见解的演说者都在群众大会上发表了激烈演说，攻击政府腐败无能并要求在古巴恢复民主自由权利。
    古巴警察野蛮地向大会进攻。古巴社会主义人民党书记处书记罗第盖兹因而牺牲生命。但是，大会仍继续进行并获得很大胜利。
    古巴社会主义人民党散发了三十余万份传单，提出组织民族民主阵线（前译全国民主阵线）的纲领，该纲领号召组织一个为和平而斗争的全民统一的政府，以解决因古巴总统苏加拉斯推行战争政策而加重了的古巴的经济困难。
