    Drainage Machines Bring a Bumper Harvest

    This year, over 30,000 mu of paddy fields in Yitai Embankment, Wuhu County, Southern Anhui Province, will reap a harvest unseen in the past twenty years. The reason for the bumper harvest is the construction of a joint public-private mechanical drainage project in the area this year. The land in Yitai Embankment is fertile, but due to its low-lying terrain, it is prone to waterlogging and disasters. In the twenty-five years since the embankment was built, it has suffered twenty floods. Last autumn, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Southern Anhui People's Administrative Office began discussing the establishment of a mechanical drainage project for Yitai Embankment with the Shanghai private enterprise China Agricultural Water Conservancy Company, and construction began in April this year. By the beginning of July, the mechanical drainage station in Yitai Embankment was fully completed. The station includes eight power engines with a total of 1,200 horsepower, capable of operating twenty-four 14-inch diameter water pumps, draining 400 tons of water per minute. This year in July, continuous heavy rains fell in the areas along the Yangtze River in Southern Anhui, with Yitai Embankment experiencing over 400 millimeters of rainfall, and the paddy fields accumulating two feet of water. After starting the water pumps, the accumulated water was completely drained in seven days. Currently, our country does not yet have the conditions to universally establish mechanical water conservancy projects; however, we should encourage private investment in key projects and joint operation with the state. At the same time, we should use existing examples to educate farmers about industry leading agriculture and the worker-peasant alliance, so that farmers can understand from concrete examples that agriculture cannot achieve great development without workers.

    排水机器带来了丰收
    皖南区芜湖县易太圩的三万多亩稻田，今年将获得二十年来未有的丰收。丰收的原因，是该地今年修建了公私合营的机械排水工程。易太圩土地肥沃，但因地势低洼，容易积涝成灾。该圩建圩二十五年，就遭了二十次水灾。去年秋天皖南人民行政公署农林处就开始和上海私营中国农田水利公司洽商举办易太圩机械排水工程，今年四月开始施工。七月初，易太圩的机械排水站就已全部完工。该站包括八台动力机，共一千二百匹马力，能开动二十四部十四吋口径的水泵，在每分钟内排水四百吨。今年七月，皖南沿长江地区连降暴雨，易太圩连续降雨四百公厘以上，稻田积水两尺深。开动了水泵，七天就把积水全部排除了。在目前，我们国家还没有普遍建立机械水利工程的条件；但应该鼓励私人有重点地投资和国家共同经营这样的工程。同时，应该用已有的实例向农民进行工业领导农业与工农联盟的教育，让农民从具体的事情认识到：农业要想大发展，离开工人就不行。
