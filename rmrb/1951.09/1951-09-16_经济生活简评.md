    Organizing Private Cotton Ginning for State Processing
    Strengthening Ideological Education for Them Is Necessary

    Ginning seed cotton into lint cotton is an important step in the cotton purchasing process. The success or failure of this work directly affects the progress of cotton purchasing and the timely supply of raw materials to the textile industry. This year, with the expansion of cotton fields and increased production, coupled with the urgency of the autumn purchasing tasks, most areas are experiencing a shortage of seed cotton processing equipment. Some cooperatives and textile companies in various cotton-producing areas have already undertaken specific work such as adding equipment and organizing processing capacity, which is very necessary. At the same time, local administrative departments should also organize private cotton ginning businesses to process cotton for the state, which is also a very important task. The Shitan District Cotton Purchasing Committee in Feidong County, Northern Anhui Province, organized all ginning businesses in the district into a joint operation to process cotton for the state through a meeting of all ginning businesses in the district before the widespread picking of new cotton. This benefits both the state and the private ginning businesses. The state can carry out seed cotton processing in a more planned manner, and the private ginning businesses can obtain reasonable profits through state-entrusted processing.

    After private cotton ginning businesses are organized, an important task to pay attention to is strengthening leadership over them. Because these ginning businesses are small handicraft operators or handicraft capitalists, they are accustomed to working independently in their business methods and are relatively conservative in technological improvements. Therefore, in joint operations, attention should be paid to their unity and cooperation and guiding them to appropriately improve their technology. At the same time, it is even more necessary to strengthen their patriotic education, so that they understand the consistency of individual interests with national interests, and consciously abide by state regulations for processing.

    New Cotton Purchasing Should Be Combined with Material Supply

    New cotton has been successively entering the market in Zhao County, Hebei Province, and is increasing daily. Because the Zhao County Grain Depot underestimated the situation of cotton farmers purchasing large quantities of grain after selling cotton, the amount of grain on the market was small and the supply could not keep up, so the grain price once rose. Due to the increase in grain prices, the cotton-grain price ratio also became unreasonable. Each catty of standard lint cotton could only be exchanged for 8.2 catties of millet (according to the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee's regulations, the cotton-grain price ratio is a minimum of 8.5 catties of millet per catty of standard lint cotton), which reduced the cotton farmers' interest in selling large quantities of cotton. Later, after the Shijiazhuang City Grain Company of the province instructed the Zhao County Grain Depot to vigorously supply and sell grain, the grain price stabilized, and the cotton-grain price ratio tended to be reasonable. This fact shows that material supply work must be combined with cotton purchasing work; otherwise, it will seriously hinder the completion of the cotton purchasing task, cause local price increases, and make the people dissatisfied with the government. This is a great loss for both the country and the people. Leading cadres of the people's governments in various cotton-producing areas should recognize that as a result of this year's expansion of cotton fields, grain fields will be relatively reduced, and this year's grain demand will inevitably increase compared with previous years. Therefore, the planned supply of grain has become one of the important keys to completing the cotton purchasing task. To do this work well, state-owned specialized companies should strive for consistent steps and close cooperation, combining purchasing and selling, and投放 and 回笼, to avoid local price fluctuations.

    组织私营轧花业为国家加工
    应加强对他们的思想教育
    把籽棉轧成皮棉是收购新棉工作中的重要环节之
    一。这件工作做得好坏，直接影响棉花收购工作的进行，和对纺织工业原料的及时供应。今年棉田扩大，产量增加，再加上秋季收购任务的紧迫，多数地区都有籽棉加工设备不敷应用的情况。各棉区若干合作社、花纱布公司等为了解决这个问题，已进行增添设备，组织加工力量等具体工作，这是很必要的。与此同时当地的行政部门还应组织私营轧花业为国家加工，这也是一件很重要的工作。皖北肥东县石塘区购棉委员会，在新棉普遍收摘以前通过全区轧花业户会议，把全区轧花机组织联营，为国家加工棉花，这样做对国家和私营轧花业都有好处，国家也可比较有计划地进行籽棉加工；私营轧花业通过国家的委托加工，得到了合理利润。
    在私营轧花业组织起来以后，应注意的一件重要的工作是加强对他们的领导。因为这些轧花业户是小手工业者或是手工业资本家，他们在经营方法上习惯单干，在技术改进上则比较保守。为此，在联营中就要注意他们之间的团结合作和领导他们适当地改进技术。同时，更需要对他们加强爱国主义教育，使他们知道个人利益与国家利益的一致性，自觉地遵守国家的规定进行加工。
    收购新棉要与物资供应相结合
    河北省赵县棉花市场新棉已陆续上市，并日有增多。赵县粮栈因为对于棉农卖棉后大量购买粮食的情况估计不足，因而粮食上市量少，供应不上，粮价
    一度上涨。由于粮价上涨，棉粮的比价也形成不合理，每斤标准皮棉只能换到八斤二两小米（按政务院财政经济委员会规定棉粮比价为每斤标准皮棉最低换八斤半小米），因而降低了棉农大量出售棉花的兴趣，后经该省石家庄市粮食公司指示赵县粮栈大力供应与出售粮食后，粮价才平稳起来，棉粮比价趋向合理。这一事实说明：物资供应工作必须与购棉工作相结合；否则，就会严重地妨碍购棉任务的完成，就会造成局部的物价上涨，人民对政府就会不满意。这对国家与人民都是很大的损失。各地产棉区人民政府的领导干部应当认识：由于今年扩大棉田的结果，粮田就要相对减少，今年粮食的需要量较往年必有增加，因而有计划地供应粮食就成为完成购棉任务的重要关键之一。为作好这一工作，国营各专业公司应力求步调一致，密切配合，作到收购与出售、投放与回笼相结合，以避免局部的物价动荡。
