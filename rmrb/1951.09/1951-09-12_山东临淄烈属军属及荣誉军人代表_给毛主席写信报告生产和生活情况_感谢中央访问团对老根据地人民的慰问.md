To the esteemed Chairman Mao:

The visiting group you sent has arrived in our county. Seeing the comrades of the visiting group is just like seeing you. In this hot weather, the visiting group, without fear of hardship, came to visit our lives, carefully inspected the work of substitute farming, told us about the current situation, and showed us movies, which really made us happy. Here, we, on behalf of all the revolutionary martyrs' families, revolutionary military families, and honored servicemen in the county, extend our cordial greetings to you and thank you for your concern for us.

Chairman Mao: You led the people of our country to defeat Japanese imperialism and crush the Kuomintang reactionaries, establishing a new China where the people are the masters. Our children or husbands, in order to defend their motherland and our fruits of victory, joined the People's Liberation Army or the Chinese People's Volunteers, standing on the front lines of national defense. We feel infinitely honored by this.

We would like to tell you about our situation. Since you led us in carrying out the land reform, our production has been developing day by day. We have learned production techniques such as seed soaking, seed selection, drought resistance, flood prevention, and pest control. In the future, we will participate in production even more actively. At the same time, the preferential treatment and substitute farming provided by the government and the masses have greatly helped our production and life. This year, all substitute farming groups and fixed substitute farming households have included substitute farming in their patriotic pledges. The substitute farming work has been done very conscientiously, the crops are growing very well, and the grain harvested is more than in previous years.

Dear Chairman Mao, we will never forget your concern for us. We will definitely respond to your call with practical actions. We will "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" in the movement to resist America and aid Korea and love our country. We wish you good health.

Representatives of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Revolutionary Military Families, and Honored Servicemen of Linzi County, Shandong Province

    给毛主席写信报告生产和生活情况
    感谢中央访问团对老根据地人民的慰问敬爱的毛主席：
    你派来的访问团已来到我县了，我们见了访问团各位同志，真和见了你一样。在这大热天，访问团不辞劳苦，来访问我们的生活，仔细地检查代耕工作，讲目前形势给我们听，演电影给我们看，真使我们高兴极了。在这里，我们代表全县革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和荣誉军人等，向你致以亲切的敬礼，感谢你对我们的关怀。
    毛主席：你领导我们全国人民，打败了日本帝国主义，又打垮了国民党反动派，建立了新中国，人民当家作了主人。我们的子女或丈夫，他们为了保卫自己的祖国，保卫我们的胜利果实，参加了人民解放军或人民志愿军，站在国防的最前线，对此，我们感到无上的光荣。
    我们很想把我们的光景告诉你听。自从你领导我们进行了土地改革以后，我们的生产就一天一天发展起来。我们学会了浸种、选种、抗旱、防涝、杀虫等等生产技术。今后，我们要更加积极地参加生产。同时，政府和群众对我们的优抚和代耕，更大大地帮助了我们的生产和生活，今年各代耕组和固定代耕户都把代耕订在爱国公约上，代耕工作做的很认真，庄稼长的都很好，打的粮食也比往年多了。
    亲爱的毛主席，你对我们的关怀，我们是时刻不会忘记的。我们一定用实际行动响应你的号召，我们要在抗美援朝爱国运动中“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。敬祝你身体健康。
    山东省临淄县革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、荣誉军人代表上
