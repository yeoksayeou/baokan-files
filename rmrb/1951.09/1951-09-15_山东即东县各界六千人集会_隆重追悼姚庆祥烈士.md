    【新华社济南十一日电】在开城中立区执行军事警察任务时被美、李匪军杀害的中国人民志愿军排长姚庆祥烈士的故乡山东省即东县（新设县，前误为济东县）各界人民六千余人，于八日在姚烈士的诞生地——姚家庄，隆重举行追悼姚庆祥烈士大会。各界人民代表均赶来参加大会。四乡人民抬着花圈，满怀着悲愤的情绪，前来参加。
    追悼会在肃穆的哀乐声中开始。在即东县人民政府县长言化午报告了姚烈士生前事迹与遇害经过后，山东省各界人民代表会议协商委员会副主席、山东省抗美援朝分会秘书长李澄之讲话，他愤慨地说：姚庆祥排长的牺牲，更加证明了美帝国主义的狡诈无耻和对谈判没有诚意。他号召大家化悲愤为力量，为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划、保卫祖国的安全与远东的和平而奋斗。新民乡代表唐承诺说：为了给姚烈士报仇，我乡已经修订了爱国公约与生产计划，明年要增加四万二千余斤粮食，把全乡原来的捐献计划再增加百分之二十一。他并建议把山东所捐献的飞机中的一架，命名为“姚庆祥号”。姚烈士的大姐在会上激愤地说：“我的兄弟是为了使朝鲜人民、中国人民和全世界人民能够过太平日子而牺牲的。我相信他的血是不会白流的，全世界人民一定会给我的兄弟报仇。”
    到会群众激昂地高呼：“反对美国破坏停战谈判！”“反对美国武装日本！”等口号。会后，即东县人民政府、山东省抗美援朝分会均分别抚恤了姚烈士的家属。
