Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 8th. The American aggressors' bandit behavior of repeatedly sabotaging the Kaesong negotiations has caused seething anger throughout the entire Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

A certain unit that fought from Yunshan to near Suwon, constantly and severely annihilating the American and Rhee bandit troops, the commanders and fighters of this heroic unit with illustrious battle achievements expressed deep indignation at the series of shameless acts by the American aggressors in sabotaging the armistice negotiations. More than 90 percent of the companies in this unit held discussion meetings, and the soldiers shouted angrily to severely punish the American murderers and avenge platoon leader Yao and other comrades who sacrificed or were wounded for the cause of peace. The unit commander received "Resolutions to Defend Peace" written by the companies. The resolution from the "Steel Company" stated: "If the American aggressors are determined to continue fighting, our company requests to undertake the most arduous combat missions."

Another "Resist America, Aid Korea Hero Company" thwarted eight attacks by more than a thousand enemy troops in a joint land-air operation during the Han River's south bank blocking battle. They also held discussion meetings by squad. All commanders and fighters of the company unanimously stated that they will strive for a second glorious red flag in the future struggle to defend peace.

The commanders and fighters of a certain unit that severely battered the US 10th Corps in the Changjin Lake area stated one after another: Our patience is limited, and we cannot tolerate the American bandits continuing to act so lawlessly and recklessly. The 6th Company of a certain unit, in a recent blocking battle, defended Height 818.9 south of Kimhwa, killing or wounding more than 600 enemies in eighteen days and nights. The company's commanders and fighters unanimously swore: to eliminate more invading troops, to avenge platoon leader Yao and comrades Yang Xianzhe, Zhang Renfeng, and others. Liu Shude, the machine gun platoon leader of a certain unit, said: "The American murderers who are stubbornly clinging to their course cannot escape the punishment of justice."

The newspapers of the various Volunteer Army units are publishing full pages of letters written by the soldiers. These letters call on comrades to polish their weapons, prepare themselves, resolutely smash the enemy's new military adventures, and fight to the end for a just peace in Korea.

    对美国一再破坏谈判的盗匪行为
    我志愿军全军怒不可遏
    坚决表示要粉碎敌人新的军事冒险
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】美国侵略者一再破坏开城谈判的盗匪行为，已使我志愿军全军上下怒不可遏。
    某部从云山打到水原附近，曾不断痛歼美李匪军。这个战功赫赫的英雄部队的指战员们对美国侵略者破坏停战谈判的一连串无耻行径深表愤慨。该部百分之九十以上的连队都举行了座谈会，战士们激愤的高呼严惩美国杀人犯，替姚排长和其他为和平事业而牺牲或负伤的战友们复仇。该部指挥员收到了各连队写的“保卫和平决心书”。“钢铁连”的决心书中写道：“如果美国侵略者决心要打下去，我连要求担当最艰巨的战斗任务”。
    另部“抗美援朝英雄连”曾在汉江南岸阻击战中粉碎了一千多敌人陆空联合的八次进攻。他们也以班为单位举行了座谈会。全连指战员们一致表示：要在今后保卫和平的斗争中，争取第二面光辉的红旗。
    曾经在长津湖地区痛打美军第十兵团的某部指战员们纷纷表示：我们的忍耐是有限度的，我们不能容忍美国强盗继续这样无法无天胡作非为。某部第六连在最近的阻击战中，据守金城以南八一八点九高地，十八昼夜杀伤敌人六百多名。该连指战员一致宣誓：要消灭更多的进犯军，为姚排长与杨显泽、张仁凤等战友复仇。某部机枪连排长刘树德说：“执迷不悟的美国杀人犯是逃不掉正义的惩罚的。”
    志愿军各部队的报纸均整版地刊登着战士们写来的信件。这些信件都号召战友们擦亮武器，作好准备，坚决粉碎敌人新的军事冒险，为争取朝鲜的公正的和平而斗争到底。
