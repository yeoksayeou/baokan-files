After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, Cangxian Special District, due to the attention paid by Party committees and people's governments at all levels to propaganda and education among the broad masses, and the reasonable handling of many marriage cases and disputes, has achieved considerable success in implementing the Marriage Law over the past year. According to statistics, in Bo Town alone, 488 young men and women married through free love or after obtaining parental consent through struggle in the past year. From January to June this year, the entire special district handled a total of 801 marriage cases. Renqiu, Bo Town and other places also paid attention to promoting new-style marriages and publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law. For example, when the civil affairs staff of Bo Town People's Government and the cadres of Cang Town Cultural Center got married, they invited the masses to participate in the wedding and promoted the Marriage Law, which had a great effect.

However, there are still many serious problems in some areas, and women's suffering is still quite deep. According to incomplete statistics, 47 women in the district were killed or committed suicide due to marital disputes in the first half of this year. Han Guozhen, a woman from Zhao Xiamatou Village, Third District, Jiahe County, was frequently beaten and scolded. She applied to the County People's Government for divorce and was granted a divorce; however, the man appealed to the Special District Court and at the same time asked the village cadres to persuade Han Guozhen to return home, deceiving her by saying, "I guarantee I won't beat or scold you again." The night Han returned home, she was hacked to death by the man with an axe. (The man has fled to escape punishment). In addition, the evil custom of mercenary marriage has not yet been completely eliminated, and the saying "When a daughter is married off, a yellow ox enters the door" (meaning the money from selling the daughter can buy a yellow ox) is still circulating. In some villages in northern Renqiu County, the groom must give the bride one hundred feet of cloth, and in some cases as much as ten shi of grain. The main reason for the above-mentioned serious phenomenon is that these areas have not seriously implemented the Marriage Law; some village cadres have a resistant attitude towards the Marriage Law and not only do not actively support the young men and women who are carrying out the anti-feudal struggle, but also attack them. According to a survey in Cang County, most of the incidents of women committing suicide over marriage problems occur in backward villages and villages with unsound women's organizations. In Sanlidi Village, Fifth District, Cang County, a young woman proposed a divorce, and the village cadres detained the woman for half the night. When a widow in Longguan Village, Hejian remarried, her father-in-law would not allow her to take her property, which was also met with sympathy from the village cadres.

In order to correctly implement the Marriage Law and overcome the serious phenomena of interfering with freedom of marriage and abusing and killing women, on August 22, Cangxian Special District convened an expanded conference of county and district women cadres with marriage issues as one of the main contents. It summarized the past work in implementing the Marriage Law and formulated a plan for improving future work. The Cangxian District Committee of the Communist Party of China re-issued relevant instructions on August 27, proposing: 1. Strengthen cadre education, correct cadres' (especially village cadres') and the masses' incorrect understanding of the Marriage Law, eliminate the erroneous idea that the Marriage Law is a "women's law" or a "divorce law" and that they do not dare to boldly publicize it, as well as the feudal idea and erroneous attitude that "a woman who proposes a divorce is dishonest and improper" and that they suppress marriage problems and do not deal with them fairly. A deep learning movement of the Marriage Law must be re-launched among cadres at all levels. The implementation of the Marriage Law should be regarded as a long-term task. 2. Launch extensive and in-depth publicity so that the Marriage Law, like other national laws, is known to every household and everyone. In order to enable the masses to fully understand and master the marriage policy, it is necessary to promote reporters and propagandists to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education through different forms and occasions, and refer to the experience of publicizing the Regulations on Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries to write the full text of the Marriage Law and its popular explanations on the walls of various places to attract the attention of the broad masses. In addition, according to existing experience, typical marriage cases and examples of happy marriages should be used to educate the masses. 3. Quickly, seriously, and reasonably resolve marital disputes. Each county should investigate past incidents of women being killed or committing suicide, clarify the situation, find out the causes, and handle them seriously. It is necessary to support women's reasonable divorce and marriage requests. In order to make the process of handling marital disputes a process of educating the masses and implementing the Marriage Law, methods such as mobile trials, public trials, and collective mediation can be adopted. Representatives of the Democratic Women's Federation should be invited to sit in on the trials.

### 沧县专区执行婚姻法已获成绩  仍须继续贯彻婚姻法

    沧县专区执行婚姻法已获成绩
    仍须继续贯彻婚姻法
    婚姻法颁布后，沧县专区由于各级党委和人民政府注意了对广大人民的宣传教育，并合理地处理了许多婚姻案件、婚姻纠纷，一年多以来，在贯彻执行婚姻法方面，已取得了不少成绩。据统计，仅泊镇一年来，经自由恋爱或经过斗争征得家长同意而结婚的男女青年达四百八十八人。今年一月到六月，全专区共处理婚姻案件八百零一件。任邱、泊镇等地，还注意提倡新式婚姻，宣传贯彻婚姻法。如泊镇镇人民政府民政科员、沧镇文化馆干部结婚时，都邀请群众参加婚礼，宣传婚姻法，效果很大。
    但是，目前在某些地区还存有不少严重问题，妇女的痛苦还相当深重。据不完全的统计，全区今年上半年因婚姻纠纷被杀或自杀的妇女有四十七人。交河县三区赵下码头村妇女韩国珍，因时常挨打受骂，曾向县人民政府申请离婚，并经判决离婚；但男方又到专区法院上诉，同时托村干部劝韩国珍回家，欺骗说“保证不再打骂”。韩回家当夜便被男方用斧头砸死。（男方已畏罪潜逃）此外，买卖婚姻恶习至今尚未彻底肃清，还流传着“闺女出聘，黄牛进门”（意思是卖闺女的钱可买一条黄牛）的说法。任邱县北部有些村庄，结婚男方须给女方一百尺布，多者达十石粮。造成上述严重现象的原因，主要这些地区是还没有认真贯彻执行婚姻法；某些村干部，对婚姻法抱着抵抗态度，不但不积极支持进行反封建斗争的青年男女，反而给以打击。据沧县调查，妇女为婚姻问题而自杀的事件，多半发生在落后村与妇女组织不健全的村庄。沧县五区三里堤村，一青年妇女提出离婚，该村干部把女方扣押了半夜。河间龙贯村一个寡妇改嫁，公公不让带财产，也得到村干部的同情。
    为正确贯彻婚姻法，克服干涉婚姻自由及虐杀妇女的严重现象，八月二十二日，沧县专区召开了以婚姻问题为主要内容之一的县区妇女干部扩大会议，总结了过去贯彻婚姻法的工作，订出了今后改进工作的计划。中共沧县地委复于八月二十七日发出有关指示，提出：一、加强干部教育，纠正干部（特别是村干部）、群众对婚姻法的不正确认识，肃清那些认为婚姻法是“妇女法”、“离婚法”，而不敢大胆宣传的错误思想，以及认为“女的提出离婚就是不老实不正派”，而对婚姻问题采取压抑，不作公平处理的封建思想和错误态度。在各级干部中要重新开展一个对婚姻法的深入学习运动。要把贯彻执行婚姻法，视为长期的工作任务。二、广泛深入地展开宣传，使婚姻法和其他国家大法一样作到家喻户晓，人人皆知。为使群众全面了解并掌握婚姻政策，就必须推动报告员、宣传员，通过不同形式与不同场合，进行广泛深入的宣传教育，并可参照宣传惩治反革命条例的经验，把婚姻法全文及其通俗解说，写在各地墙上，以引起广大人民的注意。此外，还应根据已有的经验，用典型的婚姻案件，以及美满婚姻的事例，教育群众。三、迅速、认真、合理地解决婚姻纠纷。各县应对以往妇女被杀、自杀事件进行调查，弄清情况，找出原因，认真处理。要支持妇女合理的离婚、结婚要求。为使处理婚姻纠纷的过程成为教育群众、贯彻婚姻法的过程，可以采取巡回就审，公开审讯，以及集体调解等办法。审讯时应请民主妇联代表陪审。
