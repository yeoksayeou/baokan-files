Xun Rong's Self-Criticism

\tI have been away from my hometown, Enping County, for ten years. Because of my strong hometown sentiments, I took leave this year during the Lunar New Year to visit relatives.

\tThis time, upon returning to my hometown, surrounded and urged by the "masses," without reporting to or requesting instructions from higher-level organizations, and without consulting the local Party committee, I only notified the local county government. On February 11th, I privately convened so-called merchant and business people's meetings and farmers' meetings in Shentang Market. At the time, I subjectively believed that the purpose of convening these two meetings was to publicize the policies of the Party and the People's Government and to answer some of the opinions and demands of the masses. However, because I did not understand the local situation, the landlord class and their lackeys and bad elements controlled the meeting. Landlords and bullies who had already been struggled against by the peasants even began to complain at the meeting, saying that the peasants had wrongly struggled against them. I unconsciously supported them, boosting the enemy's prestige and the arrogance of bad elements, which in reality struck a blow to the local peasants' fighting spirit and the prestige of local cadres, seriously damaging the local land reform work.

\tAfter this incident, I still did not realize that I had been surrounded by the landlord class and bad elements. I still thought my approach was basically correct. But after criticism and education from the Guangdong Central District Committee, the South China Sub-Bureau, and comrades, I realized my mistake. The nature of my mistake was not simply a matter of being unorganized and undisciplined, but of failing to distinguish between friend and foe and losing my class stand. Therefore, the mistake was serious, and I should admit my mistake to the people of Enping County.

\tAlthough I have participated in the revolution for more than twenty years, I have not studied hard enough, and bad ideas often trouble my mind. This incident, after the criticism and help from higher authorities and comrades, made me realize that my mistake was extremely serious. This proves that my policy level is too poor, and my organizational and disciplinary sense is severely lacking. It also proves that my position is unstable. The occurrence of this mistake was not accidental and should be examined from my consistent ideological style. First and foremost, my Party spirit is not strong, and my class stand is vague. I cannot recognize each person from a class standpoint, treating bad people as good people. Therefore, in daily performance, I only see the phenomena of things without recognizing their essence. I adopt a careless attitude in dealing with problems, just trying to get by. At the same time, in this matter, I put on the airs of an old Party member and veteran revolutionary cadre, which led to this serious mistake. Secondly, I have not studied enough. Chairman Mao once educated us: we are becoming unfamiliar with things we were once familiar with, and we are being forced to do things we are not familiar with. However, because my subjective efforts were insufficient, although I have participated in the revolution for more than twenty years, my cultural and political theory level is very low, and my understanding of policies is even worse. Not only could I not implement the policies and guidelines of the Party and the People's Government, but I stumbled and unconsciously harmed the interests of the people, which is extremely dangerous.

\tThrough the education from higher authorities and the help from comrades, I now understand the reasons for my mistake. I accept all criticisms and punishments given to me by the organization. From this mistake, I also realized several issues: First, only by bravely admitting my mistakes, facing them squarely, and exposing them completely and unreservedly can the organization prescribe the right medicine based on my mistakes to give me better education. At the same time, privately convening meetings is not allowed by organizational discipline; casually talking without organizational procedures is wrong. Secondly, in the future, under the leadership of the Party, I will consciously strengthen my study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improve my theoretical and policy level, so that I can correctly judge and handle problems. Third, I must always be vigilant in the future and handle problems with an attitude of being responsible to the people. When problems are discovered, investigations and studies must be carried out, the situation must be understood, a firm class stand must be taken, and the bad styles of carelessness, lack of organization and discipline, and self-righteousness must be opposed. I must improve my political sense of responsibility, improve my spirit of being responsible to the organization and to the people, to ensure that I do not make mistakes or make fewer mistakes in the future and improve my work.

Editor's Note: Chairman Mao said in his closing speech at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "War and land reform are the two 'tests' for all people and all parties in China during the period of New Democracy. Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and who stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary. Whoever only stands on the side of the revolutionary people in words but acts differently is a verbal revolutionary; only if one stands on the side of the revolutionary people not only in words but also in actions is one a complete revolutionary." Xun Rong did not stand on the side of the revolutionary people according to the Party's principles in the land reform movement but instead stood on the side of the landlord class. He treated landlords as "masses" and used his seniority and privileges to do "good" things for these "masses." Of course, this inevitably supported the landlords and struck a blow to the peasants. This action completely lost the class stand and political qualities of a Communist Party member.

In his self-criticism, Xun Rong has already admitted: "putting on the airs of an old Party member and veteran revolutionary cadre," "although participating in the revolution for more than twenty years, my political theory level is very low, and my understanding of policies is even worse," and "not studying hard enough, bad ideas often trouble my mind," etc. His lesson is great, and all comrades who have not yet firmly established their position should take this as a warning.

### 禤荣的自我检讨

    禤荣的自我检讨
    我离开家乡——恩平县已有十年了。因为我的乡亲观念很浓厚，就趁今年旧历年的机会，告假返乡探亲。
    这次回到家乡，就在“群众”的包围和要求下，没有报告请示上级组织，也没有和当地党委商量，只通知当地县政府一声，于二月十一日私自在圣堂墟召开所谓商民大会、农民大会。当时我主观上认为，召开这两次大会的目的是宣传党和人民政府的政策，并希望能答复群众的一些意见和要求。但是，因为我对当地情况不了解，竟被地主阶级及其狗腿子、坏分子控制了会场，已被农民斗争过的地主恶霸居然在大会诉起苦来，说农民斗错了他们。我便不自觉地替他们撑了腰，助长了敌人的威风，助长了坏分子的气焰，实际就是打击了当地的农民的斗争情绪，打击了当地干部的威信，严重地损害了当地的土地改革工作。
    这件事情发生后，我还没有发觉我已被地主阶级和坏分子所包围，我还以为我的做法基本上是对的。但经过粤中地委、华南分局及同志们的批评教育，我才认识到我的错误。我错误的性质不单纯是无组织、无纪律，而是敌友我不分、丧失阶级立场。因此错误是严重的，我应该向恩平县人民承认错误。
    我虽然参加革命已有二十多年，但因为我学习不努力，坏意识经常在我脑子里作怪。这件事情，经过上级与同志们的批评帮助，使我认识到我的错误是十分严重的。这证明我的政策水平太差，组织性和纪律性非常不够。同时亦证明我的立场是不稳的。这次错误的发生不是偶然的，应从我一贯的思想作风来检讨。首先是党性不强，阶级立场模糊。我不能从阶级立场出发去认识每一个人，将坏人也当作好人，因而在日常表现上，只看到事物的现象，没有认识到事物的本质；对问题的处理采取粗枝大叶的态度，得过且过。同时，在这件事情上，我摆出老党员、老革命干部的架子，致造成这次严重的错误。其次，是学习不够。毛主席曾教育我们：我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。但是，因为我主观的努力不够，虽然参加革命已二十多年，文化、政治理论水平却很低，对政策的了解更差，不但不能贯彻执行党和人民政府的政策路线，反而跌了跤子，损害了人民群众的利益都不自觉，这是极其危险的事。
    这次经过上级的教育和同志们的帮助，我已明白我犯错误的原因，我接受组织给我的一切批评和处分。从这次所犯错误中我也体会到几个问题：首先，只有勇敢地承认自己的错误，正视错误，毫无保留、毫无掩饰地将它暴露出来，组织上才能根据我的错误，对症下药，以便给我更好的教育。同时，私自召开大会，是组织纪律所不能容许的；不经组织手续随便夸夸其谈是不对的。其次，今后我在党领导下，自觉地加强学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，提高理论政策水平，才能正确地判断问题和处理问题。第三、今后要时刻提高警惕性，要用对人民负责的态度去处理问题。发现问题要调查研究，要了解情况，要站稳阶级立场，反对粗枝大叶、无组织、无纪律、自以为是的不良作风，提高政治责任心，提高向组织负责、向人民群众负责的精神，以保证今后不犯错误或少犯错误，将工作提高一步。
    编者按：毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议的闭幕词中说过：“战争和土改是在新民主主义的历史时期内考验全中国一切人们、一切党派的两个‘关’。什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。什么人只是口头上站在革命人民方面而在行动上则另是一样，他就是一个口头革命派，如果不但在口头上而且在行动上也站在革命人民方面，他就是一个完全的革命派。”禤荣在土地改革运动中没有按照党的原则站在革命人民方面，而是站在了地主阶级一边。他把地主当作“群众”，利用他的老资格和特权来为这些“群众”办“好”事。当然，这也就必然替地主撑了腰，打击了农民。这种行动完全丧失了共产党员的阶级立场和政治品质。
    禤荣在检讨中，已经承认：“摆老党员、老革命干部的架子。”“虽然参加革命已二十多年，但政治理论水平很低，对政策了解更差。”“学习不努力，坏意识经常在脑子里作怪。”等，他这个教训是很大的，一切尚未站稳立场的同志，均应以此为戒。
