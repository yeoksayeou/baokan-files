Party committees and trade unions in various regions have begun to arrange for workers' political education.

Conducting regular and systematic basic education in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought among the working masses, and continuously improving the political consciousness and class consciousness of the working masses, is the most important task in workers' education at present. In the past year, in workers' education in various regions, on the one hand, some factory and mining party organizations, administrative departments, trade unions, and youth leagues have neglected the leadership's thinking on workers' political education, and on the other hand, they have simply emphasized cultural education or technical education, without appropriately combining political education for the working class with cultural and technical education. Therefore, many deviations have occurred. However, after the party committees and trade unions in various regions have successively checked and criticized this erroneous thinking, the workers' political education work in various regions has been preliminarily improved. Party committees and trade unions in various regions have successively arranged plans or have begun to conduct systematic basic education in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought among workers.

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions on strengthening political education for industrial workers and has formulated specific plans. It pointed out that education in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought should be the main content of workers' political education in the future. At present, education on communism and the Communist Party is being carried out. The main target is industrial workers, especially workers in larger factories and mines. It is required that factories and mines with more than 500 people complete this education within one and a half years (at most two years) after the start of education. The education method is mainly spare-time learning, supplemented by rotational training. Spare-time learning is based on classroom lectures, supplemented by discussions. Education on communism and the Communist Party is planned to begin in December. Before December, education on the history of the workers' movement will be conducted to enable workers to recognize the revolutionary qualities and glorious revolutionary traditions of the Chinese working class, understand the leadership and flesh-and-blood relationship of the Chinese Communist Party with the Chinese working class, and improve the class consciousness of workers, so as to lay the foundation for carrying out education on communism and the Communist Party. At the same time, systematic reports on current affairs and policies should also be conducted among workers. The rotational training of employees in Hebei Province is mainly aimed at backbone members of industrial workers and grassroots trade union cadres who are not separated from production. In addition, time for political, cultural, and technical learning should be appropriately allocated, and full-time political instructors should be set up among workers. The Party committee must strengthen leadership and control over the political education of workers.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, based on the actual situation of workers in Beijing, have made workers' political education the most important task at present and have made specific plans to first carry it out in larger factories, mines, enterprises, and vocational schools for workers in various districts. Currently, Beijing People's Printing Factory, Mentougou Coal Mine, and other units have already started. Generally, it is stipulated that classes are held once a week for one hour each time, and the political class time is included in the current six hours of spare-time cultural learning per week. The textbook for the political class is the Party member textbook "Communism and the Communist Party." The teachers are cadres from various factories, mines, and districts. According to statistics from twenty-one factories and mines, the number of people participating in the study has reached more than 30,000.

The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, after summarizing the political study of textile workers in Tianjin, have decided to systematically and regularly conduct political education among all industrial workers in the city and in workers' vocational schools starting this fall.

In addition to the railway, ordnance, and steel plants in Shanxi Province conducting political training for employees separately, the Shanxi Provincial Staff and Workers School has also decided to set up workers' political training classes, and selected old technical workers, foremen, production team leaders, and model workers from various factories and mines to conduct rotational training in batches. The planned study time for each session is two months. Two sessions will be held this year, with 200 participants in each session. Next year, it is planned to expand to 500 participants per session and hold two sessions, striving to complete the rotational training of 5,000 industrial workers within three years. In addition, a cadre training class attached to the staff and workers' union will be held, with 80 people in each session and a time of three months; a professional training class for grassroots cadres who are not separated from production will be held, with 120 people in each session and a time of one to two weeks. Teaching content: The workers' political training class focuses on studying the history of social development, and the on-the-job cadre training class focuses on instilling education on the Communist Party, communism, and new democracy.

The Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has also recently formulated a "Two-Year Education Plan" on strengthening the political theory education of employees. It was decided to conduct education on the history of the workers' movement and the history of the Chinese Communist Party among employees from September to December. Later, systematic education on new democracy and communism will be conducted. The education method is mainly spare-time education, supplemented by short-term rotational training, and is led by the vocational education committees of various factories and mines.

In addition, the Tangshan Staff and Workers Cadre School has also formulated a political education plan (which has begun in mid-August), and staff and workers in Dalian in Northeast China, Hengyang in Hunan, and Xiangtan have also launched Party history studies.

    各地党委、工会开始布置进行工人政治教育
    向工人群众进行经常的系统的马克思、列宁主义——毛泽东思想的基本教育，不断提高工人群众的政治觉悟、阶级觉悟，是目前工人教育中最主要的任务。一年来各地在工人教育中，一方面因某些厂矿党组织、行政、工会、青年团的领导思想上对工人政治教育工作的忽视，一方面因单纯强调了文化教育或技术教育，而没有把对于工人阶级的政治教育与文化技术教育适当地结合起来，因此曾发生了不少的偏向。但经各地党委和工会先后检查和批判了这种错误思想后，目前各地工人政治教育工作已经有了初步的改进。各地党委和工会已先后布置计划或已开始向工人进行了系统的马克思、列宁主义——毛泽东思想的基本教育。
    中共河北省委已发出了关于加强产业工人政治教育的指示，并制订了具体的计划。指出马克思、列宁主义——毛泽东思想教育应该是今后工人政治教育的主要内容。目前是进行关于共产主义与共产党的教育。主要对象为产业工人，首先是较大厂矿的工人，要求五百人以上的厂矿，在教育开始后的一年半（最多两年）内完成此种教育。教育方法以业余学习为主，抽调轮训为辅。业余学习则一律以上课讲授为主，讨论为辅。关于共产主义与共产党的教育，准备于十二月开始。在十二月以前先进行职工运动史的教育，使职工认识到中国工人阶级的革命品质和光荣伟大的革命传统，认识中国共产党对中国工人阶级的领导和血肉相联的关系，提高职工的阶级觉悟，以打下进行共产主义与共产党教育的基础。同时在工人中还要进行关于当前时事政策的系统报告。关于河北省职工的轮训，则主要对象为产业工人中的骨干分子，及基层工会的不脱离生产的干部。此外要适当地分配政治、文化与技术学习的时间，并要在工人中设置专职的政治教员。对工人的政治教育，党委必须加强领导与掌握。
    中共北京市委和北京市总工会，根据北京市工人的实际情况，已经把工人政治教育工作做为当前最重要的任务，并已做出了具体计划，决定首先在较大的工厂、矿山、企业及各区职工业余学校内进行。目前已开始的有北京人民印刷厂、门头沟煤矿等单位。一般规定每周上课一次，每次一小时，政治课时间包括在目前每周六小时的业余文化学习时间内。政治课的教材采用了党员课本“共产主义和共产党”。教员则由各工厂、矿山、区的干部担任。据二十一个工厂矿山的统计，参加学习的人数目前已达三万余人。
    中共天津市委和天津市总工会在总结了天津纺织工人政治学习以后，已决定从今年秋季开始对全市产业工人，及在工人业余学校中普遍进行系统的经常的政治教育。
    山西省职工除铁路、兵工、炼钢厂已分别进行职工政治训练外，山西省职工学校并已决定开办工人政治训练班，抽调各工厂矿山的老技术工人、工长、生产小组长、劳动模范等分期进行轮训。计划每期学习时间为二个月。今年举办两期，每期参加学习的人数为二百名，明年上半年拟扩大为每期五百名，训练两期，争取在三年内完成五千名产业工人的轮训任务。此外在职工会附设干部轮训班，每期八十人，时间三个月；不脱离生产的基层干部专业轮训班，每期一百二十人，时间一周至两周。教学内容：工人政治训练班以学习社会发展史为主，在职干部训练班以灌输关于共产党、共产主义及新民主主义的教育为主。
    察哈尔省总工会最近也制订了关于加强职工政治理论教育的“二年教育计划”。决定自九月至十二月向职工进行职工运动史和中国共产党党史的教育。以后再系统地进行新民主主义和共产主义教育。教育方法以业余教育为主，短期轮训为辅，由各工厂矿山职工业余教育委员会领导进行。
    此外，唐山市职工干部学校也制订了政治教育计划（已自八月中旬开始），东北大连、湖南衡阳、湘潭等地职工亦均展开了党史学习。
