A Review of the Soviet Film "The Brave People"
He Luo

I finished watching "The Brave People" with pleasure and gratitude. This is a colorful sound film that brilliantly reflects the noble qualities, heroic spirit of the Soviet people, as well as the natural wealth of the Caucasus and their healthy, joyful lives. The story is filled with patriotic ideas.

From the poetic pasture life to the celebration of the war's victory, almost every scene is colorful, vivid, concise, and interesting. For example, the first shot is of the magnificent and majestic Caucasus Mountains. A rider rushes along the mountain road, bringing news of wolves attacking the horses. Suddenly, life is boiling over. Through wolf hunting, horse training, dancing, shooting, horse racing, etc., the audience is quickly introduced to all the important characters, laying the groundwork for future events and demonstrating that this nation and its people are indeed happy, great, and not to be taken lightly. Sure enough, when the German invaders came, regardless of men, women, old, or young, they resolutely took up the struggle. Some went to fight as guerrillas, some to work as transportation, some to engage in underground work in the occupied areas... each was so brave and resourceful. Especially at the final victory celebration, when we see the knights performing various stunts, the buglers blowing their proud horns, and the heroic people and horses adorned with red flowers, receiving the cheers of the crowd, it makes people deeply feel that the children personally cultivated by Lenin and Stalin not only have enough strength to protect their territory, but are also strong pillars for defending world peace.

The author's portrayal of heroic images and character depiction is successful.

For example, Vakhtang, the young horse herder, rider, and protagonist of the whole film, the growth of his heroic character is shown naturally and typically. Vakhtang first shows his talent at the horse race where he won the championship, but before that, we saw the characteristics of his character: when the wolves came to attack, when everyone else went out to fight, he also wanted to go, but the doctor asked him to stay and guaranteed with his head to watch the newborn foal, he obeyed the order; also, he publicly exposed the new horse trainer Berezhkov (a German spy) for his destructive horse training methods; his continuous hits in the shooting range; his diligent care for the foal. All these show that he already had good discipline, high vigilance, a strong sense of responsibility, and skilled techniques. Then, when the war came, all his strengths and advantages developed even further. Especially when we see him bravely remove the burning shells from the burning stable, rescuing eighteen valuable racehorses, discovering that spies are signaling to the German parachute troops and fighting with them, pursuing the enemy alone and getting injured, sneaking into the enemy's bathhouse to steal horses, jumping on the train to rescue the compatriots of the motherland... This series of thrilling actions makes people more aware of how solid and rich the content of a Soviet people's heroic qualities is! However, does such a description mean that Vakhtang is a rare perfect person? No, the author also writes about the other side of his true emotions: once, when other guerrillas were happily singing "Golden grassland, Soviet Russia, you are our beloved motherland..." Vakhtang was thinking of his lover, Nadia, and sighing. So his companion Hakim asked him—

Hakim: Why are you sighing again, Vakhtang? That's not good. Are you a soldier?
Vakhtang: Yes, a soldier.
Hakim: You are a soldier, Nadia is also a soldier. Think—what does the name Nadia mean? I hope you throw away Nadia. Why are you disappointed? Losing a horse is a pity, losing a friend is sad, but losing your responsibility, good brother, is shameful!
Vakhtang: I know it's shameful myself, Hakim, I'm sad.

This means that both oneself and one's lover are glorious soldiers, fighting for the motherland, and life is very fulfilling and meaningful. Even if they are separated from each other, why be sentimental? In fact, there is nothing wrong with missing one's lover, but one should have a correct attitude towards personal and collective interests. A passionate person, precisely because he cannot help but think of his lover, think of his hometown, think of his motherland, think of all lovely things, will be more motivated, more determined, more heroic, and more determined to fight to the end. Vakhtang is such a person. In fact, later he jumped off the train to save many female compatriots, didn't he save his lover as well? Therefore, writing about Vakhtang's emotional fluctuations not only does not detract from his heroic qualities, but on the contrary, adds to the authenticity of the character.

Also, the retired old coach of the ranch - Voronov and his granddaughter Nadia are also quite outstanding characters, and the film describes them very vividly.

Voronov refuses to admit he is old. At the critical moment of driving away the wolves, he whipped his horse and stopped the herd from running off the cliff, making a contribution. All these show the old man's patriotic enthusiasm and indomitable spirit. This can only explain that his amazing performance in underground work later was by no means accidental. As for Nadia, she is a smart, beautiful, and diligent girl. She loves Vakhtang, and Vakhtang loves her. They understand each other and encourage each other. When the enemy attacked, she also went underground, shuttling between urban and rural areas, delivering various important intelligence and instructions very vigilantly and secretly, and cursing the enemy agents when she was arrested.

What does it tell us through these three characters? It shows that Soviet heroes are everywhere. They are only representative roles among men, women, old, and young. Among them, although Vakhtang is more prominent, he is not some "superman". That is to say, when the author describes Vakhtang, he also makes people believe that others like Voronov, Nadia, and even Hakim, who are not very prominent, are completely the same in basic heroic qualities. Why? Because it is the same soil, the same seeds. Therefore, from here we can also see that the author's portrayal of heroic images and character depiction is quite successful because he also correctly reflects the social system that produced this hero, the living conditions that formed this character, and the strong leadership of the Party.

In the criticisms of the film in the Soviet "Pravda" and "Art Newspaper" and other newspapers and periodicals, it was pointed out that "The Brave People" is a thriller. The characteristic of this genre or style is "in the performance of the action itself and the tense scenes of the plot." That is to say, "to give the protagonists the opportunity to show their wit, courage, perseverance, insight, and ability to quickly and correctly determine the course of action in extremely complex situations." (Shening: Playwright's Notes) If it is not thrilling for the sake of thrills, not for the sake of interest, not pretentious, and deliberate mystification, but strictly adheres to the truth of life, vividly and truthfully shows the noble character of progressive human beings in the struggle for revolutionary interests, then this style is also very useful. "The Brave People" is an example. It can be said that it is a work combining realism and revolutionary romanticism. Indeed, like in the past War of Resistance Against Japan, the Liberation War, and now on the front lines of Korea, those countless thrilling stories and heroic acts of sacrificing oneself to blow up bunkers, climbing onto tanks to throw bombs, sneaking into enemy camps at night, capturing prisoners with wit, and fighting against special agents are all waiting for us to express them on the screen and on the stage. Therefore, we must learn this style well. Naturally, when using this style, the attitude should be very cautious. If you are not careful, you may forget the authenticity of life in pursuit of the tension and changes in the plot. Even "The Brave People" inevitably has this slight flaw: in addition to the Soviet playwright Shening pointing out that in the scene where the Germans were taking a bath and Vakhtang sneaked in to steal horses, the director inevitably described the enemy as "gentle and dull military children," for the same reason, when Voronov was in the crowd of Germans at the railway station, he suddenly drove his carriage and ran away, and the shooting did not hit him or even no one chased him a little, which was also somewhat unreal. Although the Germans were in a hurry to take the train and retreat at the time. Suppose it was changed to this treatment: the old man Voronov does not need to rush and leave the station and run, maybe it is more natural?

However, "The Brave People" is still a successful work. After watching this film with high ideological and artistic value, we have gained many benefits. At least it will give the audience this enlightenment: be prepared at any time, strive to make contributions, and on the post of defending peace and democracy, brave people are happy people.

    苏联影片“勇敢的人”评介
    何洛
    带着愉快和感激的心情，我看完了“勇敢的人”。这是一部五彩有声片，它卓越地反映出苏维埃人民的高贵品质，英雄气概以及高加索的天然财富和健康欢乐的生活图景。故事是充满着爱国主义的思想的。
    从诗意的牧场生活开始到庆祝战争的胜利为止，差不多每个场面都是那样的多彩、生动、简洁、有趣。譬如第一个镜头，就是那瑰奇、雄伟的高加索群山，山路上飞驰着一个报信的骑者，他带来了狼群袭击牧马的消息，于是整个生活沸腾了。通过打狼、练马、跳舞、射击、赛马等等，很快地便给观众介绍了全部重要的角色，埋下了未来事件的各种伏线，同时也显示出像这样的国家和人民，的确是幸福、伟大而不可轻侮的。果然，当德寇来侵犯的时候，不拘男女老少都坚决走上斗争的岗位了。有的去打游击，有的去作交通，有的去敌占区搞地下工作，……一个个都是那么勇敢、机智。特别是在最后庆祝胜利的大会上，当我们看到骑士们表演出各种绝技，号手们吹起了自豪的喇叭，英雄的人和英雄的马都披红戴花地接受着万众欢呼的时候，更使人深深地感到：由列宁和斯大林亲手培养出来的儿女们，不仅有足够的力量保护自己的疆土，而且也是捍卫世界和平的坚强柱石。
    作者在英雄形象的塑造上和人物性格的刻划上，是成功的。
    譬如伐夏——青年牧马者、骑手、全剧的主角，他的英雄性格的成长，表现得就很自然也很典型。伐夏初露头角是在第一次夺得了锦标的赛马大会上，但在这之前，我们就看到他的性格的特点了：如像当狼群来袭，全体出去赶打的时候，他也是想一同去的，但医生叫他留下，以脑袋担保，看守刚生下来的小马，他也就服从了命令；又如他当众揭发新来的练马者别列茨基（德寇的奸细）的带破坏性的练马方法；在射击场射击时的连发连中；对于小马的尽心抚养。这些都说明了他很早就具有良好的纪律性，高度的警惕性，责任心强，技术纯熟。接着战争一来，所有他的长处和优点便更加发展了。特别是当我们看到他奋不顾身地从着火的马棚中搬掉燃烧的炮弹，抢救出十八匹可贵的跑马，发现奸细给德寇降落伞部队打信号而与之撕打，单骑追敌受伤，潜入洗澡的敌群中盗马，跳上火车抢救祖国的妇女同胞……这一连串惊心动魄的行动，使人更加认识到一个苏维埃人民的英雄品质的内容是多么的坚实，多么的丰富！然而这样的描述，是不是就说伐夏便是一个稀世的完人了呢？不，作者也写出他真实情感中的另一面：某次当别的游击队员正愉快地唱着“金黄色的草原，苏维埃的俄罗斯，你是我们可爱的祖国，……”的时候，伐夏却在想念他底爱人—娜佳而唉声叹气了。于是他的同伴哈基姆问他—
    哈：你怎么又在叹气呀，伐夏，这样可不好，你是兵吗？
    伐夏：是兵。
    哈：你是兵，娜佳也是兵，你想——想娜佳这个名字有什么意义，希望你把娜佳丢掉吧，为什么你要失望呢？丢掉了马可惜，丢掉了朋友难过，可是把自己的责任丢掉了，好兄弟，可耻啊！
    伐夏：我自己也知道可耻，哈基姆，我心里难过。
    这就是说自己和爱人都是光荣的兵，都在为了祖国而斗争，生活都非常充实而有意义，就是彼此分离开了又何必感伤？！其实，怀念爱人没有什么不可以，但对待个人利益和集体利益应有正确的态度。一个热情的人，正因为不能不想到爱人，想到故乡，想到祖国，想到一切可爱的事物，他才会更加奋发，更加坚决，更加英勇，更加要斗争到底。伐夏也就是这样的人物。事实上，后来他跳车救下许多妇女同胞，不是连自己的爱人也一同救下了么？因此写出伐夏的这种感情上的波动，不但无损于他的英雄品质，相反，更增加了人物的真实性。
    还有，像牧场退休的老教练——伏罗诺夫以及他底孙女娜佳也是相当杰出的人物，影片对他们描写得也很生动。
    伏罗诺夫不服老，在赶狼的千钧一发的时候，跃马加鞭截住了快要奔下悬崖的马群而立了功，这些都显出了老人的爱国热情和刚毅精神。这也才能够说明以后他在地下工作中得到那样惊人的表现，决不是偶然的。至于娜佳呢，她是一个聪明、美丽、勤于学习的少女，她爱伐夏，伐夏也爱她。彼此了解，互相勉励。在敌人打来的时候，她也潜入地下活动，往来城乡之间，很机警而又很秘密地传递着各种重要的情报和指令，并在被捕的时候，痛骂敌寇特务。
    通过这三个人物，给我们说明什么呢？说明苏维埃的英雄所在皆是。他们不过是男女老少中的代表角色而已。其中如伐夏虽然更加突出些，但也不是一个什么“超人”。也就是说作者在描写伐夏的时候，也使人们相信其他如伏罗诺夫、娜佳乃至哈基姆一类不很显著的人物，在基本的英雄素质上是完全相同的。为什么呢？因为这是同样的土壤，同样的种子。因此，从这里我们还可以看到作者在英雄形象的塑造上和人物性格的刻绘上之所以得到相当的成功，就是因为他同时也正确地反映出产生这种英雄的社会制度，形成这种性格的生活情况和党的坚强的领导。
    在苏联“真理报”“艺术报”等报刊对本片的批评中，曾指出“勇敢的人”是一部惊险影片。它所具有的这种体裁或样式的特点是“在表现动作本身及情节的紧张场面”。也就是说，“给主人公们以机会去表现自己的机智、勇敢、坚忍、洞察力，及善于迅速正确地在极其复杂的情况中定夺方针。”（谢宁：剧作家手记）如果不是为惊险而惊险，不是为兴趣而兴趣，不是矫揉造作，故弄玄虚，而是严格遵守生活的真理，在紧张诱人的情节中，鲜明地、真实地表现出进步人类在为革命利益而斗争中的高贵品德，那末，这种样式也是很有用的。“勇敢的人”就是一个范例。可以说，它是现实主义和革命的浪漫主义结合的作品。的确，像过去抗日战争中、解放战争中以及现在朝鲜的前线，那些舍身炸碉堡，爬上坦克扔炸弹，夜摸敌营，智擒俘虏，反特务斗争等等说不完的惊险故事、英雄行为，不都有待我们在银幕和舞台上去表现吗？因此，我们必须要很好地学习这种样式。自然，在运用这种样式的时候，态度是应该非常慎重的，一不注意，就可能为追求情节的紧张、变化而忘却了生活的真实性。即如“勇敢的人”，也难免有这种微疵：这除了苏联的剧作家谢宁指出在德寇洗澡而伐夏潜往盗马的场面里，编导未免把敌人描写成为“温良、愚钝的军事顽童”外，同样的理由，当伏罗诺夫处身在火车站的德寇群中，忽然赶起马车就跑，而子弹的射击并没有对他命中甚至没有人去稍加追赶，也是有些不够真实的。虽说德寇在当时急于乘车溃退。假使改为这样的处理：老人伏罗诺夫不必发急而离开车站再跑，也许较为自然些吧？
    然而“勇敢的人”毕竟是成功之作。看完了这部思想性和艺术性都很高的片子，我们得到的益处颇多。至少它会给予观众这样的启示：随时准备，争取立功，在保卫和平民主的岗位上，勇敢的人就是幸福的人。
