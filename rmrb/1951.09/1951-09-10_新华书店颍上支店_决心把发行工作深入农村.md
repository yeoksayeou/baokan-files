Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of People's Daily

    Xinhua Bookstore Yingshang Branch, Anhui Province

    Determined to Deepen Distribution Work in Rural Areas

    To the Editors:

    We believe that the letter of criticism from Comrades Luye, Xiaozhou, and Xiaoding of the Communist Youth League Yingshang County Work Committee in Northern Anhui, published in the "Letters from Readers" section of the People's Daily on July 18, is entirely correct. The fact that Mao Zedong's portraits are not available in our county's rural areas shows that our distribution work is not done well and should be reviewed. In addition to sincerely accepting the opinions, we also guarantee that we will pay attention to rural distribution work in the future and fully supply portraits of revolutionary leaders and popular reading materials.

    The letter stated: "There are few portraits of Chairman Mao in the countryside of this county, and the prices are expensive." Regarding the price, we sell them according to the publisher's pricing. As for not being able to buy them (in the countryside), it is because we did not clearly recognize in the past that bookstores serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, when estimating the number of leader portraits and other books and periodicals to be sold, we only calculated how many agencies and schools there were in the county, and did not consider how many the masses needed at all. We also had a misconception that Yingshang is a heavily disaster-stricken area in Northern Anhui, and the masses have difficulty eating, so how could they have money to buy books? We did not see that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the lives of disaster victims have improved, and they love Chairman Mao even more, and they are willing to eat two fewer meals to buy a portrait of Chairman Mao to hang at home. Because our thinking lagged behind reality and lagged behind the masses, this serious phenomenon was caused.

    After the East China Distribution Conference, we have decided to reverse this bias. In July, we went deep into the rural areas and established three rural libraries in cooperation with the propaganda and education departments, and found six rural mobile suppliers. The Gongji Library sold sixty portraits of Chairman Mao in one day, and a total of 460 portraits of leaders in thirty days. According to the instructions of the Party Committee, and in conjunction with the land reform movement, we plan to distribute a large number of portraits of Chairman Mao, distributing 50,000 copies this year, and another 50,000 copies by the end of February 1952, so that each of the 100,300 households in the county has one copy. We are even more confident and determined to complete the plan because of the criticism written by Comrades Luye and others.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    决心把发行工作深入农村编辑同志：
    七月十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏内登载青年团皖北颍上县工作委员会绿野、小周、小丁三同志的批评信，我们认为这些意见完全是正确的。我县农村里买不到毛主席像，说明我们发行工作做得不好，应该检讨，我们除诚恳接受意见外，并保证今后注意农村发行工作，充分供应革命领袖像及通俗读物。
    信中说：“本县乡间毛主席像少，价钱贵。”价钱方面我们是根据出版家的定价而出售的，至于买不到（乡间），是因为我们过去没有明确地认识到书店是为工农兵服务的，因此估计领袖像及其他书刊销行份数时，只计算全县有多少机关学校，根本没有计划群众需要多少。我们还有一个错觉，认为颍上是淮北的重灾区，群众吃的就困难，那有钱来买书？没看到灾民在共产党领导下生活好转了，更热爱毛主席，情愿少吃两顿饭，也要买张毛主席像挂在家里。由于我们思想落后于现实，落后于群众，致造成这个严重的现象。
    华东发行会议后，我们已下决心扭转这个偏向。七月份深入农村，配合宣教部门建立了三个农村图书室，找了六个农村流动供应员。宫集图书室一天售出六十张毛主席像，在三十天共售领袖像四百六十张。根据党委指示，并计划结合土地改革运动，大量发行毛主席像，本年度发行五万张，到一九五二年二月底再发行五万张，要做到全县十万零三千户每家一张。承绿野等三同志写信批评，更加强了我们完成计划的信心和决心。
