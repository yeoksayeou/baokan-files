    My Views on the People's Representative Conferences of Various Counties in Ding County Prefecture
    Fan Wenxing, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Ding County Committee

    Ding County Prefecture, Hebei Province, governs twelve counties (with a population of 2.83 million). The entire prefecture has over 130,000 Communist Party members. Lixian County (in the east) witnessed the revolutionary armed struggle of the Gao-Li Uprising in 1931. Fuping, Quyang, and Xingtang, the mountainous western counties, served as the rear base for the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area. The constitutional movement in 1940 enhanced the people's democratic awareness, laying the foundation for political power construction. Anguo County established a People's Congress in February of last year, and Xinle County delegated the functions of the People's Congress to the People's Representative Conference in July of this year. In the past two years, each county has convened five to seven People's Representative Conferences, achieving certain successes in promoting democracy, improving cadre work style, and strengthening ties between the government and the people, which has powerfully advanced various tasks such as resisting America, aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the patriotic production increase movement. Business, industrial, and religious circles, which had previously been indifferent to current affairs, also participated in the movement to defend the homeland. Some long-standing cases that were difficult for the government to handle, such as the land concealment issue in Liuchang Village, Anguo County, which lasted for over a decade, were resolved after discussion and investigation by the People's Representative Conference. These achievements cannot be ignored. However, should we be complacent because of this? Absolutely not. Several fundamental shortcomings still exist in our political power construction work, which we must improve.

    After reading Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing and the People's Daily's commentary on democratic political power construction, I was greatly enlightened. I want to use this standard to measure the political power construction work in Ding County Prefecture. The following shortcomings in our work are obvious:

    (1) The People's Representative Conferences in various counties have not formed a fundamental system and are often convened hastily and temporarily under the urging of higher authorities, simply to arrange central tasks. From January to May this year, most counties did not convene People's Representative Conferences, and the standing committees were nominal and ineffective, making the work of the People's Representative Conference sporadic. Each time, it had to start from scratch.

    (2) There is a phenomenon of monopolizing the selection of representatives. The allocation of representative quotas does not have a fixed principle or standard and is often temporarily allocated before the meeting based on the nature of the work. During the election process, in some cases, cadres designated representatives or first determined targets, then ensured their election through organizational guarantees, followed by approval by the masses. Because cadres lack sufficient understanding of the importance of the united front and the distinction between the people's democratic dictatorship and the worker-peasant democratic dictatorship, and because they did not absorb the opinions of the majority, they often overemphasized the representation of poor peasants and hired laborers or politically pure peasants, neglecting the broadness of representation. Arbitrary replacement of representatives also occurred. The representative of She'er Village in Anguo County was called back after arriving in the county without explanation. Furthermore, excessive participation of cadres in the meetings and the poor democratic style of cadres have transformed the People's Representative Conference into a cadre meeting, mobilization meeting, or training class. Therefore, representatives reflected, "Those with red passes (referring to representatives) do not have as much power as those with yellow passes (referring to attending cadres)." Secondly, formalism in election procedures also occurred. Xinle County adopted the method of direct voting by voters last year, which proved to be very laborious, and the masses were not satisfied. Facts have proven that the method of direct voting is not suitable for the current rural areas. The key to doing a good job in election work lies in doing a good job of publicizing to the masses and fully deliberating and consulting among the masses. Direct or indirect hand-raising elections are not only easy to implement but also effective.

    (3) The meetings simply arrange central tasks without discussing proposals related to the lives of the masses. The second People's Representative Conference of Xinle County (with a total of 188 proposals) included proposals on policies, production, finance, culture, education, and health, as well as criticisms of leaders and reports of corruption. This shows that the masses care about and value the People's Representative Conference, but the leadership has adopted a bureaucratic attitude and provided irresponsible answers to the masses' proposals. Therefore, the representatives are doubtful and dissatisfied, feeling that they cannot give an account when they return. Of the 33 proposals from the representative assembly in Anguo County last February that were pending, none have been processed to date. A representative from Ding County proposed, "The city gate cave is about to collapse, and it is dangerous for people to pass by. It should be demolished." Such a task that should be done and is easy to do has neither been answered nor implemented by the government. Therefore, the masses are unwilling to make proposals. The county has a population of 700,000, and only 13 proposals were made at the sixth representative conference.

    Why do these problems occur? First of all, the leadership's thinking and methods are not keeping up with the needs of the new situation. The understanding of the point that "the People's Representative Conference is the fundamental system of the state" is not deep enough, and democratic political power construction is being set against the central tasks. Importance is attached to production leadership, and political power construction is neglected. It is believed that when there is too much work, the People's Representative Conference cannot be convened on time; it is believed that convening the People's Representative Conference will affect the work. They are accustomed to assigning tasks through the organization and relying on cadres, using simple methods such as Party resolutions and instructions from higher authorities, rather than humbly consulting with representatives on how to complete the work; they only seek the completion of tasks without paying attention to the quality of the work and its impact on the masses. After Ding County convened the People's Representative Conference to discuss the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the people actively rose up to help the government. For example, a fugitive counter-revolutionary criminal in Yaoyuntou was finally arrested and executed after being reported by the masses. Twenty-four villages in the second district of Xinle County submitted 117 reports and accusations. Facts show that if the People's Representative Conference in that county is held well, the work will be completed well. Political power construction plays a significant role in guaranteeing economic construction and other tasks. There is no contradiction between them; they complement each other.

    Secondly, being responsible to higher authorities and being responsible to the masses are set against each other. There are two types of tasks: one is the central task proposed by higher authorities based on the interests of the majority of the people, and the other is the problems that need to be solved in the lives of the local masses. Only caring about the central tasks and not caring about the lives of the masses is a manifestation of a weak mass perspective. Because if the problems in the masses' proposals are not resolved, everyone will not be interested in the People's Representative Conference and will become indifferent to the central tasks. Instead of examining themselves, the leadership mistakenly believes that the People's Representative Conference is not as effective as the cadre meeting. Some people believe, "In the future, the People's Representative Conference will only discuss major policies, and the specific central tasks will be implemented by the cadre meeting." This understanding is also incorrect. The shortcoming lies in not caring about the lives of the masses, not because the central tasks were discussed. The correct approach should be to solve both the central tasks and the problems in the lives of the masses, and to unify the two tasks.

    Again, the issue of the Party's leadership and the bold implementation of democracy is also an issue that cadres are ideologically entangled with. It should be affirmed that the Party's leadership and guarantee are necessary at all times, but this leadership is by no means like the Party's monopolistic and independent work in some places, first drawing rigid patterns and asking the masses to follow them; even forcing everyone to accept work plans that are not suitable for the situation. When the People's Representative Conference in Anguo County was conducting elections, if the candidates nominated by the mass representatives were not within the list determined by the Party organization, some Party member representatives would say no, but without explaining the reasons. Ma Li, a representative from Shaoguo, said, "The Party has already made arrangements. What is the use of elections?" These closed-door monopolistic phenomena must be resolutely overcome. The correct leadership is: Party members use patient persuasion to raise the awareness of the masses, humbly consult with the masses, and actively implement resolutions, turning the construction of democratic political power into a mass movement; even if individual deviations occur in some places, they can only be corrected through the masses and cannot be replaced. This is a delicate and arduous task. We must unify being responsible to the Party and being responsible to the people ideologically and methodologically, correct the tendency of closed-doorism, and prevent tailism.

    Holding the People's Representative Conference well and quickly enabling it to exercise the functions of the People's Congress is an urgent task. How can we improve the work of democratic political power construction? According to the experience of various counties, it is first necessary to solve the ideological problems of cadres in many ways. County leading cadres must seriously inspect and summarize the work of political power construction; organize cadres and Party members to study documents related to political power construction, and educate everyone on the mass perspective, democratic work style, and national political power construction. At the People's Representative Conference, conduct a mass inspection of the work of the People's Representative Conference, so that representatives can recognize their rights and obligations, and combine top-down improvement with bottom-up supervision. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the organization and work of the standing committee, and set up one to three full-time resident committee members to exercise the functions of the standing committee. Again, in addition to establishing a system for meetings and the election of representatives, it is also necessary to establish complete archives and strengthen inspection to ensure that all resolutions of the People's Representative Conference are fully implemented.

    我对定县专区各县人民代表会议的看法
    中共定县地委副书记  范文兴
    河北省定县专区辖十二个县，（人口二八三万人）。全区有共产党员十三万余人。（东部的蠡县）一九三一年曾暴发了革命的武装斗争——高蠡起义。西部山区的阜平、曲阳、行唐，为晋察冀抗日根据地的后方。全区经过一九四○年的宪政运动，人民的民主觉悟有了提高，为政权建设工作打下了基础。安国县在去年二月建立了人民代表大会，新乐县于今年七月由各界人民代表会议代行了人民代表大会职权。两年来各县都召开过五次至七次人民代表会议，在发扬民主，改进干部作风，密切政府与人民群众的联系等方面，都获得一定成绩，有力地推动了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、爱国丰产运动等各种工作。历来对时事冷淡的工商界、宗教界也参加了保家卫国的运动；政府很难处理的某些积案，如安国县流昌村十几年的瞒地问题，经人民代表会议讨论和调查后，也获得了解决。这些成绩是不可忽视的。但是我们是否可以因此而自满呢？绝对不可以。我们在政权建设工作中还存在着若干根本的缺点，这是我们必须加以改进的。
    我读了刘少奇同志在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话和人民日报发表的有关民主政权建设的评论，这给了我很大启示。我要用这一标准来衡量定县专区的政权建设工作。我们的工作中还存在以下缺点是显而易见的。
    （一）各县的人民代表会议，没有形成为基本的制度，常是在上级的督促下，单纯地为布置中心工作而临时仓促召开的。今年一月至五月，多数县份没有召开人民代表会议，常委会有名无实、形同虚设，使人民代表会议工作一开一散，下次又得从头谈起。
    （二）代表的产生有包办现象，分配代表名额没有一定原则标准，常是在会前根据工作性质临时分配。在选举过程中，有的是由干部指定或先确定目标再经过组织保证，然后群众通过。因为干部对统一战线的重要，人民民主专政和工农民主专政的区别认识不足，加上又没有吸收多数人的意见，就常发生偏重贫雇农成份或政治纯洁的农民，忽略了代表的广泛性。随意撤换代表的事也曾发生。安国舍二村的代表到县后，没说明理由又被叫回去。再加代表会上干部列席过多，干部民主作风差，使人民代表会议变质为干部会、动员会、训练班。因此，代表反映：“带红条的不如带黄条的（指列席干部）权力大。”其次，选举的形式主义偏向也曾发生过，新乐县去年采用了选民直接投票选举的办法，结果费劲很大，群众也不满意。事实证明，直接票选的办法，是不适宜于目前农村的。搞好选举工作的关键，在于做好对群众的宣传工作及群众中的充分酝酿、讨论协商。直接或间接的举手选举办法，不但易行，又有实效。
    （三）会议上单纯地布置中心工作，不讨论关于群众生活的提案。新乐县第二届人民代表会议（提案共一八八件），其中有政策、生产、财经、文化教育、卫生方面的提案，也有对领导提出批评，或检举贪污的提案，这说明群众对人民代表会议是关心重视的，但领导上却采取了官僚主义的态度，对群众的提案作了不负责任的解答。因此代表怀疑不满，感到回去没法交代。安国县去年二月代表大会提案待办的三三件，到现在一件也没有办到。定县代表提出：“城门洞快塌了，人走过时很危险，应拆掉。”这样一个应办又容易办的事情，政府既没答复也没执行。因此，群众都不愿提出提案了。该县有七十万人口，第六次代表会议上仅有提案十三件。
    为什么发生这些问题呢？这首先是领导思想和领导方法跟不上新形势的需要，对“人民代表会议是国家的根本制度”这一点体会不深，把民主政权建设和中心工作对立起来。重视生产领导，忽视政权建设。认为工作多了，人民代表会议就不能按期召开；认为开人民代表会议会影响工作。习惯于通过组织依靠干部，用党的决议、上级的指示等简单的方式分配任务，而不愿虚心地和代表商量完成工作的方法；只求任务的完成，不注意工作的质量和在群众中的影响。定县召开人民代表会议讨论了镇压反革命工作以后，人民积极地起来帮助政府，如尧纭头一个潜逃的反革命罪犯，经群众检举后终于逮捕归案执行枪决；新乐县二区二十四个村就提出检举和控诉书一一七件。事实说明：那县人民代表会议开好了，工作也就完成得好。政权建设工作对保证经济建设和其他各种工作有着重大作用，它们之间没有矛盾而是相辅而行的。
    其次是把对上级负责和对群众负责对立起来。任务有两种，一种是上级根据大多数人民的利益提出的中心工作，一种是当地群众生活中需要解决的问题。只管中心工作，不关心群众生活，是群众观点不强的表现，因为如果群众提案中的问题得不到解决，大家对人民代表会议就不感兴趣了，对中心工作也冷淡起来。领导上不检讨自己，反而错误地认为人民代表会议不如干部会起作用。有人认为：“以后人民代表会议只讨论大政方针，具体的中心工作由干部会来贯彻。”这种认识也是不对的，缺点在于不关心群众生活，而不是因为讨论了中心工作。正确的做法应该是：中心工作和群众生活问题都要解决，把两种任务统一起来。
    再次，对党的领导和放手实行民主，也是干部思想上纠缠不清的问题。应该肯定，任何时候都必须有党的领导和保证，但这种领导，决不是像某些地方的党内包办单干，先划出死板的图案叫群众照办；甚至还把不适合情况的工作计划，强制大家接受。安国县人民代表会议进行选举时，群众代表所提候选人不在党组织所确定的名单范围内，有的党员代表就说不行，可是没讲出道理来。烧锅代表马力说：“党早布置好了，还用选举干什么呢？”这些闭门包办现象，必须坚决克服。正确的领导是：党员用耐心说服的方式去提高群众觉悟，虚心地和群众商量，并积极执行决议，把民主政权建设形成群众性的运动；即使个别地方出了偏差，也只能通过群众去更改，不能代替修正。这是一个细腻而艰巨的工作，我们要从思想上和方法上把对党负责和对人民负责统一起来，纠正关门主义的偏向，防止尾巴主义。
    开好人民代表会议，并迅速地使之代行人民代表大会的职权，是一个迫切的任务。怎样把民主政权建设工作提高一步呢？根据各县的体验，首先必须从多方面解决干部的思想问题。县领导干部要对政权建设工作认真地进行检查总结；组织干部和党员学习有关政权建设的文件，向大家进行群众观点、民主作风和国家政权建设的教育。在人民代表会议上，对人民代表会议工作进行群众性的检查，使代表认清自己的权利和义务，使从上而下的改进和从下而上的监督结合起来。其次，要健全常委会的机构和工作，设专职驻会委员一至三人，行使常委会职权。再次，除会议、代表的选举必须形成制度外，还要建立完整的档案，并加强检查，保证人民代表会议决议全部实现。
