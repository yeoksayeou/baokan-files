Strengthen Political Study, Test Yourself in Practice!
—Lessons Learned from the Construction of the Jinan Textile Factory
Zhang Ruifeng, Engineer, Shanxi Provincial Textile Company

I participated in the construction of the Jinan Textile Factory, the first textile factory in Shanxi Province after liberation. Although the work I participated in was only a small part—the technical part of purchasing spinning machines and the design part of the frame layout project—I cannot stand aside and completely disassociate myself from the series of mistakes, large and small, that occurred in the basic construction work of the Jinan Textile Factory. Therefore, as an engineering technician, it is necessary and has positive significance for me to conduct a self-examination through this basic construction work.

Insufficiently Correct Understanding of Basic Construction Work

From the beginning, I did not pay enough attention to basic construction work, and did not recognize it as a major economic issue or a serious political issue; I did not regard it as a concrete step in the transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society. I simply and superficially regarded it as a technical issue, thinking, "Isn't it just building the houses early, buying and installing the machines early, and starting production early? Isn't it just the old way of building factories!" This is completely looking at the problem from the perspective of the bourgeoisie, not from the standpoint of the working class. In this way, bad tendencies such as a purely technical viewpoint, subjectivism, empiricism, and conservatism arose. Naturally, it manifested in the work as: no plan, no preparation, attending to one thing and losing sight of another, haste makes waste, dragging the work down, and resulting in many adverse consequences.

An Attitude That Is Not Upright Enough Toward the People's Construction Cause

My political consciousness was not raised enough, I did not establish a true sense of ownership early enough, I did not treat the people's construction cause with loyalty and honesty and wholeheartedly, but rather held an attitude of "every man sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and cares not for the frost on his neighbor's roof" to some extent. In my work, I regarded the division of labor as rigid and mechanical, only taking responsibility for my own part, and not paying enough attention to other people's parts. For example, in the work of purchasing spinning machines, my responsibility was to understand, identify, and synthesize the relevant technical aspects, and put forward opinions. I didn't pay much attention to other work such as bargaining and signing contracts, or I did pay attention, but I didn't help enough. In the part I was responsible for, I tried my best to do well. But this was not entirely an attitude of being responsible to the people, but rather had a bit of individualism in it. I thought that if I did well, I would be personally glorious, and if I didn't do well, I would be afraid of losing face. For example, in the frame layout design work, my work mood was not high enough or stable enough at that time. I was originally the director of the Taiyuan Woolen Mill. After being transferred to participate in this basic construction work, for a long time, I didn't know where my work was going to go—back to the Woolen Mill? To Jinan? Or somewhere else? On the one hand, I was still concerned about the work of the Woolen Mill, and on the other hand, I was participating in the design work of the Jinan Textile Factory. In addition, the residual hired-laborer mentality lurking in my mind was at work, so my work mood was very unstable. It manifested in the work as being passive, doing whatever was assigned, and waiting around when there was nothing to do. I didn't care enough about the situation of the Jinan Textile Factory. Should I not be responsible for the loss suffered in the work because I did not put in the strength that should have been put in?

No Complete Plan from Beginning to End

From the purchase of spinning machines to the frame layout design, I have not seen any plans from others, and I myself did not have any plans. I was just feeling my way forward in my work. Although in the course of the work, I did take the initiative to issue some lists and write some opinions, they were all fragmented and piecemeal, without a complete plan. Moreover, I often started from subjective wishes and rarely listened to the opinions of others. As a result, although no major mistakes occurred, the purchasing work was somewhat prolonged, and some small items were missed; the design work was also somewhat not completely in line with the actual situation.

Lack of Close Contact with Each Other

Our purchasing team in Shanghai, and the preparatory committee in Taiyuan, especially the construction team in Xinjiang, had very little contact, let alone close contact. Combined with the lack of planning for the entire basic construction work, there were quite a few things in the work that did not match up. For example, those who purchased spinning machines in Shanghai did not know that Jinan was going to set up a cloth factory, so there were no weft yarn spinning machines in the order for spinning machines. Later, when they learned that a cloth factory was to be set up, they quickly added weft yarn parts. However, it was impossible to verify whether these parts were actually made. Fortunately, the cloth factory was not set up temporarily, so that was that. For example, those who purchased spinning machines in Shanghai did not know the repair equipment and capabilities in Jinan, so they even ordered heavy spindles. Later, when they learned that Jinan's repair equipment was quite complete and its technical capabilities were not too low, they decided to make their own, and rushed to return them, which had already suffered some losses. For example, some materials Shanghai was preparing to start purchasing, but Taiyuan had already bought a large pile of them. There were many such repeated or omitted things.

Constantly Improve Understanding in Practice

After liberation, through political study, listening to political reports, being educated by the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, going to the factory for work inspection, participating in basic construction work inspection meetings, participating in technical meetings of engineering personnel, etc., my understanding gradually improved, my attitude gradually became upright, my work progressed, and my work style also changed. This made me deeply realize that an engineering technician has nothing without political understanding; if one does not study Marxism-Leninism, one will accomplish nothing. The changes in the things before my eyes in the past two years have already provided strong and unparalleled proof. In the future, I must definitely abandon the bad tendencies of the past, conscientiously study political theory, stand firmly on the working-class position, better serve the people, and strive for the future of socialism and even communism. On the basis of the initial improvement of ideological understanding, my understanding of basic construction has also become more upright. First of all, basic construction should be viewed farther, deeper, and wider, and should not be narrow, short-sighted, or superficial.

Basic construction is not simply an economic and technical issue, but even more a serious political issue, which itself embodies the country's industrial policy and the realization of the country's industrialization. Therefore, basic construction work is multi-faceted, constantly developing, and extremely complex and meticulous, and has an inseparable close relationship with all aspects. Any erroneous view of basic construction may lead to serious errors and losses.

Secondly, the work of basic construction must proceed from objective reality and move forward steadily; it cannot be based solely on subjective wishes, eager for quick success and instant benefits, act rashly, blindly take risks, and be fond of grand achievements. Before making a detailed investigation and careful study of various necessary economic conditions, political conditions, and other objective conditions, a preliminary design cannot be made; a detailed design cannot be made without the approval of a certain leading organ for the preliminary design; construction cannot begin without the approval of a certain leading organ for the detailed design. Moreover, from the beginning of the work, there must be preparation, steps, organization, leadership, systems, and discipline. That is to say, it must be standardized and rationalized. Basic construction work must strive for time in steady progress. An unstable and imprudent attitude will inevitably lead to errors.

If an engineering technician wants to make progress, I think he must have the above understanding. But correct understanding only solves half of the problem, and the more important half is in practice. The great motherland is increasingly moving towards brightness, and major construction work is waiting for technical personnel. Only through practice can we truly improve our understanding. Let us test ourselves in practice!

    加强政治学习，在实践中考验自己！
    ——从晋南纺织厂建厂工作中得到的教训
    山西省纺织公司工程师  张锐锋
    山西省解放后第一个纺织厂——晋南纺织厂的建设工作，我是参加了的。虽然我所参加的工作只是一小部分——采购纱机的技术部分与排车工程的设计部分，但是晋南纺织厂在基本建设工作中所发生大大小小一系列的错误，我是不能置身事外，完全脱离干系的。因此，作为一个工程技术人员的我，通过这一基本建设工作，做一番自我检查，是必要的，而且是有积极意义的。
    对基本建设工作认识不够正确
    一开始我就没有把基本建设工作重视起来，没有把它当作一个重大的经济问题、严重的政治问题来认识；没有当作是从新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会的具体步骤。只是简单地浅薄地把它当作一个技术问题看待，认为：“不过是早些把房子盖好，机器买好、装起，早日开工生产而已，还不是过去那一套旧的建厂办法！”这完全是从资产阶级的观点来看问题，而不是站在工人阶级的立场上看问题。这样，就产生了单纯技术观点、主观主义、经验主义、保守主义等不良倾向；表现在工作上，自然是：无计划，无准备，顾此失彼，欲速不达，把工作拖了下去，招致了许多不良后果。
    对人民建设事业的态度不够端正
    政治觉悟没有足够地提高，没有及早树立起真正主人翁的态度，没有忠诚老实全心全意地对待人民建设事业，而是多少抱着“各人自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜”的态度。在工作中把分工看作呆板机械的，只负自己应负的一段责任，对别人分工部分关心不够。比如在采购纱机工作上，我的责任是对有关技术方面的了解、鉴别、综合，并提出意见，对别的工作像讲价钱呀，定合同呀，我就不大关心了，或者也曾关心，但帮助不够大。在自己负责部分则是力求做好的。但这也不完全是对人民负责的态度，而有点个人主义成份在内，认为搞好了个人光彩，搞不好怕要丢面子。再如在排车设计工作上，那个时期我底工作情绪是不够高也不安定的。我原来是在太原毛织厂担任厂长的，从调出参加这一基本建设工作之后，好久好久我不知道我的工作要到那里——回毛织厂？到晋南？还是另到别的地方？一面心中还挂记着毛织厂的工作，一面又参加着晋南纺织厂的设计工作。再加脑子里潜伏着的残余雇佣观点作祟，因而工作情绪非常不安定。表现在工作上是处于被动，有什做什，没事待着。晋南纺织厂情况如何？我是不够关心的。本应加进去的力量，而没有加进去，工作上受到损失，自己还不应负责吗？
    从头到尾没有完整计划
    从采购纱机起到排车设计止，我没有看见过什么别人的计划，我自己也没有什么计划。我在工作中是走着看，看着走。虽然在工作进行中，也曾主动地开出了些单子，写出些意见，但都是零碎的、片断的，没有一个完整计划。而且每每从主观愿望出发，很少听取别人意见。结果，虽然没有发生什么大的错误，但采购工作总多少拖长了些时间，漏去了些零碎物件；设计工作也有些与实际情况不完全符合。
    相互之间缺乏密切联系
    我们到上海的采购组，与太原的筹备委员会，特别是与新绛的建厂组，不要说密切联系，就是一般的联系也很少。再结合上整个基本建设工作的没有计划，工作中对不上头的事儿是相当多的，例如：上海采购纱机的，并不知晋南还要设布厂，所以定购纱机中根本就没有纬纱精纺机。后来知道了要设布厂，赶快又补配纬纱零件。但是这些零件倒底做了没有，无法稽考。好在布厂暂时不设了，也就算了。再例如：上海采购纱机的，并不知晋南的修理设备与能力，所以定购纱机，连重铊也定上了。后来知道晋南的修理设备相当完备，技术能力也还不算太低，决定自做，赶着再退，已经吃了一些亏。再如：有些物料上海正准备开始采购，不想太原早已买下一大堆了。像这样重复了的或遗漏了的事儿是很多的。
    在实践中应不断提高认识
    解放后，经过政治学习，听取政治报告，受到抗美援朝运动的教育，到厂作工作检查，参加基本建设工作检查会议，参加工程人员的技术会议等等，
    自己的认识逐步提高，态度逐渐端正，工作有了
    进步，作风也有所改变。这使我深深体会到，一个
    工程技术人员如果没有政治认识，便没有了一切；
    如果不学习马克思列宁主义，便会一事无成。二年
    来眼前事物的改变，已经作了强烈无比的证明。今
    后必须肯定地抛弃过去的不良倾向，认真学习政治
    理论，站稳工人阶级立场，更好地为人民服务，为
    争取社会主义以至共产主义的前途而奋斗。在思想认识初步提高的基础上，我对基本建设的认识也端正一些了。首先，对基本建设应该看得远些，深些，宽些，而不能狭隘、近视、肤浅。
    基本建设不单纯是经济与技术问题，而更是一个严重的政治问题，它本身体现着国家工业政策与国家工业化的实现。因而基本建设工作是多方面的，是不断发展的，又是极其复杂细致的，和各方面有着不可分的密切联系的。对基本建设的任何错误看法，都可能招致严重的错误与损失。
    其次，基本建设的工作必须从客观实际出发，稳步前进；而不能单凭主观愿望，急于求成，轻率从事，盲目冒险，好大喜功。对各种必需的经济条件、政治条件以及其他客观条件，未做详确调查精密研究前，不能做初步设计；初步设计未经一定领导机关批准，不能做详细设计；详细设计未经一定领导机关批准，不得施工。而且工作一开始便须有准备、有步骤、有组织、有领导、有制度、有纪律。就是要正规化、合理化。基本建设工作必须在稳步前进中争取时间。不稳不慎的态度一定会招致错误。
    一个工程技术人员，如果要进步的话，我想必须要有以上的认识。但认识正确了，还只解决了问题的一半，更重要的一半是在实践。伟大的祖国日益走向光明，重大的建设工作在等待着技术人员。只有通过实践才能真正提高我们的认识。让我们在实践中来考验自己吧！
