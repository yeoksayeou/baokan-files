Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th. More than 3,000 patriotic Catholics in Nanjing and representatives from all walks of life held a celebration parade rally on the 6th to celebrate the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle to expel Archbishop Riberi.

    At the celebration rally, Li Weiguang, Acting Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Nanjing, Sun Chifang and Wang Hao, members of the preparatory committee of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, and Catholics Li Rulin, Cheng Shuxiu, and Cui Tianpei spoke successively. Li Weiguang emphasized that Riberi's so-called "super-political" and "super-national" were merely smokescreens for him to carry out the US imperialist aggression plan; Riberi's so-called "divine right" was a "divine right" serving US imperialism. Therefore, we patriotic Catholics will never be restricted by his "divine right," and our opposition to Riberi is a completely just action. Catholic representatives pointed out in their speeches that although Riberi has been expelled, there are still imperialist elements within the church. Therefore, they called on all Catholics to continue to heighten their vigilance and resolutely fight the imperialists and their running dogs to the end.

    Jin Shanbao, chairman of the Nanjing branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, and representatives of the people from all walks of life also spoke at the meeting, celebrating the victory of patriotic Catholics and encouraging them to continue their struggle and resolutely sever ties with imperialism and its ideological influence.

    The meeting passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao and an open letter to Catholics nationwide amid warm applause. Catholic representatives presented a banner to the Nanjing Municipal People's Government to express their gratitude for the government's support and love.

    A celebration parade was held after the meeting.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th. At the celebration rally for the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle to expel Archbishop Riberi, patriotic Catholics in Nanjing passed an open letter to Catholics nationwide. The original letter is as follows: Dear fellow Catholics, priests, monks, and nuns:

    After more than three months of resolute struggle against the imperialist element Riberi, we Catholics in Nanjing have finally achieved victory. The Nanjing Municipal Military Control Commission has accepted our request and permanently expelled Riberi from our country's borders on the 4th of this month. This is a victory for us Catholics in Nanjing, and also a victory for Catholics and people nationwide.

    Today, all of us Catholics in Nanjing held a grand celebration meeting and parade. At today's celebration meeting, we decided to write you a letter to report this good news to you, and also to briefly report to you the process of this struggle and our few experiences.

    The victory of our opposition to Riberi this time was achieved through arduous efforts. In this struggle against Riberi, the imperialist elements and their running dogs used all kinds of despicable and shameless means to threaten and sabotage us, saying that opposing Riberi was opposing the "divine superior," was "apostasy," would "go to hell," and would be "excommunicated," etc. Some of our Catholics also had a lot of ideological doubts because they had been deceived and blinded by imperialism in the past. Therefore, we must first resolutely smash the attacks of the imperialist elements and their running dogs. In the process of the struggle, we ideologically broke through two major barriers, one was the barrier of "super-national" and "super-political," and the other was the barrier of imperialist "divine right." We saw clearly that the so-called "super-political" of Riberi and his ilk was nothing more than a smokescreen for him to carry out reactionary political activities. In the past, the scum of Catholicism, Yu Bin and his ilk, actively colluded with the American Chiang Kai-shek bandits to participate in anti-people activities, but Riberi praised Yu Bin in every possible way, fearing that his reaction would not be strong enough; and today, when our vast number of Catholics want to rise up to love the country and break ties with imperialism, Riberi shamelessly comes to stop us and threatens us with "divine right." Isn't this point enough to expose Riberi's so-called "super-political" trick? We also see through that the "divine right" in the hands of Riberi and other imperialist elements has completely become their tool of aggression and their "magic weapon" for ruling and oppressing us Catholics. Riberi never used his "divine right" against the Catholic scum Yu Bin and his ilk, but today, when we rise up to love the country, he picks up this "magic weapon" and wants to strike us down. But Catholics, this imperialist "magic weapon" can no longer scare us awakened Catholics today.

    In this struggle against Riberi, we have learned a lot, mainly the following three points: First, we have realized that carrying out patriotic education among the vast number of Catholics is the key to our victory in the struggle. In the past, we were deceived by imperialism and did not know how to love the motherland, but instead loved the enemy, so that we could not distinguish between love and hatred. However, after the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea, we recognized the loveliness of the motherland and the people, and we distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and improved our courage and determination to fight. Secondly, we also realized that our struggle is not isolated. As long as we resolutely oppose the imperialist elements, we can obtain the support and assistance of the broad masses of people and the government, thus ensuring our victory. Third, we also deeply feel that only by launching a relentless, continuous struggle with imperialism can we eliminate the forces and influence of imperialism and implement the reform of Catholicism. Any illusion that imperialist elements will automatically retreat, as well as any attempt to achieve the goal of reform by gentle means, are harmful and unworkable.

    Dear fellow Catholics, priests, monks, and nuns: The big stone Riberi that was pressing on the heads of us Chinese Catholics has been pushed down by us. Although there are still some imperialist elements and their running dogs hiding in our church and carrying out sabotage in secret, and we must continue to heighten our vigilance and resolutely fight to the end, under the care and support of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, we believe that victory must belong to us patriotic Catholics. Catholics: Let us join hands closely and strive to purify our church and eliminate all imperialist elements and their ideological influence!

    南京天主教徒和各界代表举行游行大会
    欢庆驱逐黎培里的斗争胜利
    大会通过给全国天主教徒的一封公开信
    【新华社南京七日电】南京市爱国天主教徒和各界人民代表三千余人于六日举行庆祝游行大会，欢庆驱逐黎培里的反帝斗争的胜利。
    在庆祝大会上，天主教南京区代理主教李维光，天主教三自革新运动促进会筹备委员会委员孙持方、汪浩，教徒李汝霖、程树秀、崔天培等先后讲话。李维光着重指出黎培里所说的“超政治”、“超国家”，只是他执行美帝国主义侵略计划的烟幕；黎培里所说的“神权”，乃是为美帝国主义服务的“神权”，因此我们爱国教徒绝不受他的“神权”限制，我们反对黎培里是完全正义的行动。教徒代表们在讲话中都指出：黎培里虽被驱逐了，但教会内部还有帝国主义分子存在，因此他们号召全体教徒继续提高警惕，坚决与帝国主义及其走狗斗争到底。
    南京市抗美援朝分会主席金善宝及各界人民代表也都在会上讲了话，庆祝爱国天主教徒的胜利，鼓励他们继续奋斗，坚决割断与帝国主义的联系及其思想影响。
    大会在热烈的掌声中通过了向毛主席致敬电和给全国天主教徒的公开信。教徒代表向南京市人民政府致献锦旗，以表示感谢政府对他们的支持和爱护。
    会后举行了庆祝大游行。
    【新华社南京七日电】南京市爱国天主教徒在庆祝驱逐黎培里反帝斗争胜利大会上，通过给全国天主教徒的一封公开信，原信如下：亲爱的全体教友、神甫、修士、修女们：
    我们南京教友经过三个多月来与帝国主义分子黎培里的坚决斗争，终于得到了胜利。南京市军事管制委员会已接受我们的要求，于本月四日将黎培里永远驱逐出我国国境了，这是我们南京教友的胜利，也是全国教友和全国人民的胜利。
    我们南京全体教友今天举行了盛大庆祝会和游行。在今天的庆祝大会上，我们决定给你们写一封信向你们报告这个喜讯，同时也向你们扼要的报告一下这次斗争的经过和我们的几点体会。
    我们这次反对黎培里的斗争的胜利是经过了艰苦的努力才获得的。在这次反对黎培里的斗争中，帝国主义分子及其走狗们用尽了各种卑鄙无耻的手段来威胁破坏，说什么反对黎培里就是反对“神长”，是“叛教”，要“下地狱”，要被“开除教籍”等等，而我们部分教友由于过去受了帝国主义的欺骗蒙蔽，也有不少思想疑虑。因此我们首先要坚决打碎帝国主义分子及其走狗的进攻。在斗争过程中，我们思想上冲破了两个大关，一个是“超国家”、“超政治”的关，一个是帝国主义“神权”的关。我们看清了黎培里之流的所谓“超政治”，只不过是为他进行反动政治活动的烟幕罢了，过去的天主教的败类于斌之流积极勾结美蒋匪帮，参加反人民活动，但黎培里对于斌却是百般的称赞，惟恐他反动不力；而今天当我们广大教友要起来爱国，起来与帝国主义斩断联系的时候，黎培里却无耻的来阻止我们了，用“神权”来威吓我们了。就是这一点，黎培里所谓“超政治”的把戏，不是不戳自穿了么？我们也看穿了，掌握在黎培里等帝国主义分子手里的“神权”，已经完全变成了他们的侵略工具，变成了他们统治压迫我们教友的“法宝”。黎培里对于天主教败类于斌之流，从未用过他的“神权”，而今天当我们起来爱国的时候，他却拿起了这个“法宝”来，想把我们打下去。可是教友们，这个帝国主义的“法宝”，今天再也吓不倒我们觉悟了的天主教友了。
    在这次反对黎培里的斗争中，我们的体会是很多的，主要的有下面三点：首先我们体会到：在广大教友中开展爱国主义教育，是我们取得斗争胜利的关键。我们过去受着帝国主义的蒙蔽，不知道热爱祖国，反而热爱了敌人，以致爱憎不明，但是经过抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，认识了祖国和人民的可爱，我们就分清了敌我，提高了斗争的勇气和决心。其次，我们也体会到我们的斗争不是孤立的，只要我们坚决反对帝国主义分子，就能获得广大人民和政府的支持与援助，因而也就保障了我们的胜利。第三，我们也深深感到：只有与帝国主义展开毫不容情的继续不断的斗争，才可能肃清帝国主义的势力和影响，实行天主教的革新。任何希望帝国主义分子自动引退的幻想，以及企图以温和的方法达到革新目的的种种想法，都是有害的、行不通的。
    亲爱的全体教友、神甫、修士、修女们：压在我们中国天主教徒头上的一块大石头黎培里已经给我们推倒了。虽然在我们教会内部还掩藏着若干帝国主义分子及其走狗在暗中进行破坏，还必须继续提高警惕、坚决斗争到底，但在毛主席和人民政府的爱护和支持下，我们相信：胜利一定是属于我们爱国教徒的。教友们：让我们紧密地携起手来，为纯洁我们的教会，肃清一切帝国主义分子及其思想影响而奋斗吧！
