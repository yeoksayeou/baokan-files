Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese people are deeply dissatisfied with and opposed to the signing of the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

On September 9th, more than 20,000 leaflets protesting the separate peace treaty were distributed in Osaka. On the morning of September 8th, three monks began a hunger strike in the center of Tokyo to protest the arming of Japan and demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty. Residents of the Amami Islands, which are under U.S. trusteeship and separated from Japan, flew flags at half-mast for twenty days.

Japanese bourgeois newspapers admit that only the headquarters of the extremely reactionary Liberal Party is satisfied with the signing of the separate peace treaty. Another bourgeois political party, the National Democratic Party, is divided on this issue. Several groups, mainly the group headed by Tokutaro Kitamura, disapprove of the treaty. According to the *Mainichi Shimbun*, Kitamura said on the 10th: Yoshida's claim that the majority of the Japanese people hope to sign the security treaty is not in line with the facts. This treaty, which is unacceptable to Japan, is sufficient to cause instability in Asia.

The Japan Socialist Party is currently on the verge of splitting over the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. Right-wing socialists who were recently reinstated into the party after being purged are in favor of passing the "treaty" and the "security treaty," while "left-wing" elements, fearing that the party's influence among the working masses will be completely lost, oppose the "treaty" and the "security treaty." For example, Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the party's Central Executive Committee, publicly criticized the separate peace treaty and the "security treaty" on the 9th. He said: "This treaty is by no means a treaty of reconciliation and mutual trust as it is being promoted." He pointed out that the Japanese people's criticism of the Yoshida cabinet's diplomacy will increase over time. He said: "The provision added to the separate 'treaty' permitting the stationing of foreign armed forces in Japan will deepen the crisis in Asia and prevent Japan from restoring its sovereignty." He expressed concern about Japan's isolated position in Asia, saying that China, India, and Burma's failure to participate in the signing of the U.S.-made treaty means that "Japan is separated from Asia," and therefore Japan will not be able to be economically self-reliant. He also said that without the participation of these Asian countries, it will be difficult to resolve Asian problems. Referring to the "security treaty," Suzuki pointed out that this treaty forever binds Japan's hands and feet. Suzuki went on to say that no Japanese person wants to conclude this treaty.

Muto Takeo, chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which is influenced by the Socialist Party, also expressed his opposition to the separate peace treaty. He said that the separate peace treaty has failed to clearly terminate Japan's state of war. He believes that this treaty endangers Japan's fate.

Some of Japan's major bourgeois newspapers are also feeling confused and uneasy about the signing of the separate peace treaty. They are concerned that Japan will become isolated in Asia. The Tokyo *Asahi Shimbun* and *Mainichi Shimbun* both criticized Yoshida's speech at the San Francisco Conference. The *Mainichi Shimbun* said: "India and Burma did not attend the San Francisco Conference, so it is easy to assume that their absence has a subtle relationship with the security plan (referring to the 'US-Japan Security Treaty')." The newspaper believes that "how to promote friendship between Japan and these countries" is a "serious problem."

    日本人民反对美制单独和约
    大阪出现抗议传单奄美群岛居民挂半旗
    部分资产阶级政党和报纸也表示不满
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：日本人民对单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”的签订，深表不满和反对。
    九月九日，大阪出现了两万多张抗议单独对日媾和的传单。九月八日早晨，三个和尚在东京市中心开始绝食，抗议武装日本，要求缔结全面和约。由于被美国托管而和日本分离的奄美群岛的居民，悬挂了二十天的半旗。
    日本资产阶级的报纸承认，只有反动透顶的自由党的总部对签订单独对日“和约”表示满意。另外一个资产阶级政党——国民民主党——在这个问题上意见不一致，其中若干集团，主要是以北村德太郎为首的集团，不赞成这个条约。据《每日新闻》报道，北村十日说：吉田说日本全国大多数人民希望签订安全条约，这是不符合事实的。这个为日本所不能接受的条约足以引起亚洲的不稳定局势。
    日本社会党目前在对日和约问题上站在分裂的边缘。最近回到党里来的以前被整肃的右翼社会党人赞成通过这个“和约”和“安全条约”，而“左翼”分子由于担心该党在工人群众中的影响会完全丧失，则反对这个“和约”和“安全条约”。例如，该党中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎在九日公开抨击单独和约与“安全条约”。他说：“这个和约绝不像所宣传那样是重归于好和互相信赖的条约”。他指出：日本人民对吉田内阁外交的指责，将随着时间而增加。他说：单独“和约中所添的准许外国武装部队驻在日本的规定，将使亚洲的危机加深，并使日本不能恢复它的主权。”他忧虑日本在亚洲的孤立地位说：中国、印度和缅甸不参加签署美制和约，意味着“日本从亚洲分离开来”，因此日本将不可能在经济上自力更生。他又说：由于这些亚洲国家不参加，亚洲问题将很难获得解决。铃木在提到“安全条约”时指出：这个条约把日本的手脚永远捆住了。铃木接着说，没有一个日本人希望缔结这个条约。
    社会党影响下的日本工会总评议会的主席武藤武雄，也表示反对单独和约。他说：单独对日和约没有能够明确地终止日本的战争状态。他认为这个条约危害着日本的命运。
    日本的一些资产阶级大报，也对单独和约的签订感到惶惑不安。它们担心日本将在亚洲孤立起来。东京《朝日新闻》和《每日新闻》都抨击吉田在旧金山会议上的演说。《每日新闻》说：“印度和缅甸没有出席旧金山会议，因此很容易假定：它们的缺席与安全方案（按指‘美日安全条约’）是有微妙的关系的。”该报认为：“如何促进日本与这些国家的友谊”，是一个“严重的问题”。
