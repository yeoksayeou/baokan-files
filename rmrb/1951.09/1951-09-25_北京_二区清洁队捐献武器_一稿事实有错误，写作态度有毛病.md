    Beijing "Second District Cleaning Team Donates Weapons" Draft Has Factual Errors, Writing Attitude Has Problems
    Editor:
    The article published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 19, regarding the Beijing Second District Cleaning Team increasing production efficiency and donating airplanes and artillery, was written by Comrade Yao Meicheng, an official from the Propaganda Department of the Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, based on information provided by workers of the First Squad of the Cleaning Team. She wrote the draft in the name of the team without consulting the Cleaning Team, and then, without our consent, stamped it with the official seal and sent it to the newspaper in the name of the office. Several parts of this draft are inconsistent with the facts.
    (1) At that time, the reduction of working hours for the cleaning team workers was due not only to the workers' increased political awareness and work efficiency after receiving patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, but also to an objective reason: less garbage was produced by residents in the summer, making the cleaning team's work lighter; in the winter, it would not be possible to complete the tasks in the same amount of time.
    (2) At that time, the cleaning team had sixty-six people, and tasks could be completed in about five hours, but this was not true for all workers. Other workers had longer working hours due to different tasks.
    (3) The total number of workers in the team should be one hundred and ninety-eight. "Team Leader Zhang Fengyi" in the draft should be corrected to "Group Leader Zhang Fengyi."
    Comrade Yao Meicheng was careless in understanding the situation, treating partial information as the whole. This shows a lack of responsibility in her work. She misused the name of the cleaning team to write the draft and privately stamped the official seal to send the draft to the newspaper, which is an act of being unorganized and undisciplined. She has now made a self-criticism for the above errors. Our education for cadres is insufficient, and we lack inspection of work. The lack of a certain system in internal office work is also the cause of this error. We have conducted inspections and self-criticisms on this matter and have established some work systems to eliminate this undesirable phenomenon.

    Bai Wen, Propaganda Minister of the Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing

### 北京“二区清洁队捐献武器”一稿事实有错误，写作态度有毛病

    北京“二区清洁队捐献武器”一稿事实有错误，写作态度有毛病编辑同志：
    六月十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏所刊关于北京市第二区清洁队提高生产效率捐献飞机大炮一文，是中共北京市第二区委员会宣传部干事姚美成同志根据清洁队第一分队工人同志所谈情况写成的。她未征求清洁队同意，即用该队名义写稿，又未经我们同意，即盖了机关印戳，以机关名义寄给报社。这篇稿子有好几个地方与事实不符。
    （一）当时清洁队工人工作时间缩短，除了工人经过抗美援朝爱国主义教育，政治觉悟提高及工作效率提高的原因外，还有一个客观原因，即夏季居民出土少，清洁队工作较轻；到冬季就不能在同样工作时间内完成任务了。
    （二）当时清洁队有六十六人，五小时左右可完成任务，并非全体工人都能这样。其他工人同志因任务不同，工作时间较长。
    （三）该队全体工人应为一百九十八人。稿中“队长张凤仪”应更正为“组长张凤仪”。
    姚美成同志在了解情况时粗枝大叶，把部分情况作为全部情况。这是工作责任心不够的表现。她乱用清洁队名义写稿，又私盖公章向报社寄稿，这是无组织无纪律的行为。现在她对上述错误已经作了检讨。我们对干部教育不够，对工作缺乏检查，在机关内部工作上，缺乏一定的制度，也是造成这种错误的原因。我们对此已进行检查和检讨，并规定了一些工作制度，以消除这种不良现象。
    中共北京市第二区委员会宣传部长  白文
