Arming Japan to Invade Asia is a Consistent U.S. Policy
Zhuang Tao

On September 4th, the United States convened an illegal "peace conference" with Japan in San Francisco, excluding the People's Republic of China; on the 8th, under U.S. coercion, an illegal "peace treaty" with Japan was "passed" by 48 countries including the United States and the United Kingdom. The Chinese people, who persisted the longest, contributed the most, and sacrificed the most in the war against Japan, naturally have the greatest say in the Japanese peace treaty issue. The Chinese people cannot but express extreme indignation at the United States' barbaric act of excluding China and the Soviet Union and other major Asian countries from unilaterally concluding peace with Japan. The Chinese people have always advocated concluding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan on the basis of implementing the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements, in order to establish a democratic Japan, guarantee Asian peace, and free the more than one billion people of Asia from the threat of war. However, the central goal pursued by the United States and its vassal states in this separate peace with Japan is precisely what Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out in his statement on August 15: "To rearm Japan in order to continue and expand its war of aggression in Asia, and to step up preparations for a new world war." The United States' evil policy of rearming Japan and using Japan to invade Asia is not something that has just taken shape today, but a consistent U.S. policy towards Japan after the war, and an important component of the U.S.'s post-war global expansion policy.

(I) The Sinister U.S. Plot to Rearm Japan

As everyone knows, the United States' purpose in participating in the Pacific anti-fascist war was not to eliminate Japanese fascism, but to replace Japanese fascism and make itself the master of Asia. Therefore, after the end of World War II, the United States conspired to dominate Asia alone. However, the victorious end of World War II not only brought about fundamental changes in the world situation, but also fundamental changes in the Asian situation. The Chinese people achieved a great success in the national revolution on the basis of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and became the main force for safeguarding Asian peace. At the same time, the national liberation movements in other colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia are also flourishing. In order to achieve its goal of dominating Asia, the United States has taken various measures to suppress and obstruct the development of national liberation movements in Asian countries, and has attempted to gradually complete the encirclement of our country and the Soviet Union, preparing to launch new military adventures in order to finally establish its hegemony in Asia. In this way, Japan, which was once the only imperialist country in Asia, has become the most convenient tool for the United States to invade Asia. This is because:

First, the United States is too far away from Asia, and it is five thousand nautical miles from the west coast of the United States to Korea; while Japan faces the heartland of our country and the Asian territory of the Soviet Union. Our country and the Soviet Union are precisely the fortresses of democratic forces in Asia. Therefore, Japan's geographical location is in line with the United States' aggressive intentions.

Second, precisely because Japan was once the only imperialist country in Asia, and because its homeland did not become a battlefield during World War II, the losses were small, so Japan continued to maintain the largest naval and air force equipment and military industry in Asia after the war. According to the U.S. Strack report, in 1947, Japan had equipment capable of producing 8 million tons of steel ingots and 10 million tons of steel annually. In addition, there are various military facilities such as naval ports, airports, shipyards, and gasoline depots. These are also necessary for the United States to launch a war.

Third, during World War II, in order to maintain naval and land operations in a vast war zone from Northeast China to Java, Indonesia, and to prepare for homeland operations, Japan mobilized a maximum force of 7 million people, accounting for nearly one-tenth of Japan's total population at the time. Therefore, Japan is also the only country among the United States' Asian vassals that can provide a large number of cannon fodder. Japanese imperialism also formed a considerable number of fascist soldiers in the long-term war of aggression, which can be used by the United States.

The geographical location of Japan mentioned above, Japan's old naval and air force equipment, Japan's military industry, Japanese soldiers who can serve as cannon fodder, and Japanese fascist soldiers who can be used by the United States, have all become things that the United States must rely on to invade Asia. U.S. imperialism itself, due to its vast battlefields, long supply lines, and insufficient troops, cannot launch a large-scale war of aggression in Asia by relying on itself alone. Therefore, from the moment it occupied Japan, it harbored the sinister intention of arming Japan and turning Japan into a tool for invading Asia.

(II) How Was Japan Armed?

When MacArthur first occupied Japan, he issued a series of deceptive orders, partly due to pressure from the people and partly to make the Japanese ruling class obey. That is, to disband the Japanese navy and army, arrest war criminals headed by Tojo, deprive militarist elements of their civil rights, and in April 1946, publish Bowles' compensation report, advocating the removal of important industrial equipment capacity in Japan. This caused panic and confusion among the Japanese ruling class. After MacArthur implemented a temporary high-pressure policy against the Japanese ruling class in the early stage of the occupation, he gradually controlled Japan. When it initially controlled Japan, it began to arm Japan, turning Japan into a tool for invading Asia.

Since 1947, the U.S. policy of arming Japan has become increasingly obvious. Japanese imperialism made its fortune by relying on wars of aggression, so Japan's industry has always been highly dependent on wars of aggression and the plunder of colonies. After Japan surrendered, its industry almost collapsed due to the loss of war markets and the plunder of raw materials and funds from colonies. When Japan surrendered, the comprehensive production index of Japan's industry and mining was only 10% of that before the war. Originally, if Japan's politics and economy were thoroughly reformed at this time, and Japan's industry was turned to serve the broad masses of the people, then Japan's industry would achieve true prosperity. However, in order to restore Japan's military industry in order to arm Japan, the United States adopted a completely opposite policy at that time, that is, the policy of developing military bases and restoring military industry in parallel. In 1947, 30% of Japan's national expenditure was the U.S. occupation fee, of which nearly half was used for military construction. Therefore, in 1946 and 1947, the U.S. occupation forces used more than 30% of Japan's steel and pig iron production. In this way, the construction of military bases promoted the restoration of military industry, and the restoration of military industry expanded the construction of military bases. By 1948, Japan's steel production had recovered from 500,000 tons in 1946 to 1.11 million tons, more than doubling.

On the basis of this construction of military bases and restoration of military industry, the United States began to rebuild the Japanese army. In September 1947, MacArthur ordered the Japanese Katayama Cabinet to increase the number of Japanese police from 93,000 to 125,000, more than doubling the total number of police before the war. In May 1948, Japan established a disguised navy with 10,000 people, the Maritime Safety Agency. In order to facilitate the arming of Japan, the compensation plan has also become increasingly smaller. In March 1948, the United States put forward the Strack report. This report reduced the estimated amount of Japan's compensation to 40% of the Bowles plan. In May of the same year, the Draper report appeared, which further reduced the estimated amount of Japan's compensation to 15% of the Bowles plan. In order to use Japanese fascists as tools for arming Japan and enslaving the Japanese people, the United States began to release a large number of war criminals at this time. By November 1948, only 25 war criminals such as Tojo had been sentenced, and almost all other important war criminals had been released. These included Nishio Shuzo, former commander of the Japanese invading army to China, and Ayukawa Gisuke, former president of the Japanese Manchurian Heavy Industries Corporation. Okamura Neji, the executioner who had an irreconcilable hatred with the Chinese people, was also sent back to Japan by Chiang Kai-shek under MacArthur's order and protection.

After 1949, U.S. imperialism, due to its own increasingly serious economic panic, urgently wanted to seize the vast Asian market, so it adopted the Dodge Plan in Japan to accelerate the process of arming Japan. The Dodge Plan was formulated by U.S. banker Dodge, and its main points are three: First, increase taxes, freeze wages, and increase labor intensity to transfer the burden caused by arming Japan to the Japanese people, so that capitalists can make profits and open the way for U.S. monopoly capital to invest in Japan. Therefore, since 1949, U.S. private capital began to rapidly invest in Japan, controlling Japan's petroleum, electrical, rubber and other industries. Second, in the name of loans and relief, the U.S. transported unsalable commodities such as wheat and cotton to Japan, and then converted them into cash, which was controlled by the U.S. and invested in various important departments in Japan. In this way, the U.S. not only sold surplus commodities, but also controlled Japan's railway, electrical communication, electricity, steel, coal, shipping, banking and other economic lifelines. Third, concentrate funds and raw materials on developing basic industries directly related to war, such as railways, telecommunications, steel, and shipbuilding. In this way, after the Dodge Plan, Japan not only further became a U.S. colony, but also further became a U.S. military base. In 1949, Japan's steel production increased from 1.11 million tons in 1948 to 2 million tons, expanding by nearly one time. Therefore, in May 1949, the United States simply declared the cessation of compensation. In July 1949, MacArthur ordered the opening of oil refining factories along the Pacific coast of Japan and began to refine large quantities of gasoline for automobiles and aircraft.

With the rapid recovery of military industry, the construction of Japanese military bases has reached a considerable scale. From Hokkaido in northern Japan to southern Kyushu, there are U.S.-built air force bases everywhere. These bases have been connected into a network. The largest of these is Misawa Airport in northern Honshu. In terms of the navy, in addition to Japan's old four major naval ports, the United States has also built many new naval ports. In this way, by June of last year, the United States used Japanese bases to launch a war of aggression against Korea.

After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, Japan completely became the U.S. military's naval and air base and military supply base. Misawa Airport in northern Honshu, Japan, became the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Jet Squadron. The U.S. Air Force invading Korea set off from Japanese air bases to bomb peaceful cities in Korea and the border areas of Northeast China. The U.S. openly boasted that Yokosuka, the old naval base of Japan, was its only powerful naval base west of Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Navy invading Korea used these Japanese naval ports as bases to launch piratical attacks on the Korean coast. As for Tokyo, the political and economic center of Japan, it has become the command center for the U.S. war of aggression against Korea. Japanese factories manufacture a large number of military supplies for the U.S. military, such as guns, ammunition, military trucks, locomotives, rails, bridges, canned food, leather shoes, and sacks. As of recently, the U.S. has placed orders worth 320 million U.S. dollars with Japanese factories for the war of aggression against Korea. As of September last year, the number of Japanese personnel serving exclusively for the U.S. military had reached more than 140,000.

Because the United States has suffered continuous and serious setbacks in the war of aggression against Korea, since January of this year, the United States has sent Dulles to actively conspire to unilaterally conclude peace with Japan in order to arm Japan on a large scale in a legal form and openly use Japanese troops as cannon fodder for the U.S. invasion of Asia. Therefore, in the past six months, Dulles has spared no effort to use all kinds of shameless means of threats and inducements to pressure its vassal states to endorse its conspiracy to unilaterally conclude peace with Japan.

This is how Japan has been gradually armed under the rule of U.S. imperialism. Initially, the U.S. implemented a temporary high-pressure policy against the Japanese ruling class in order to control Japan, then began to arm after initially controlling Japan, and then used Japan as a base for invading Korea, and even today, it is preparing to turn Japan into a tool for invading Asia through a separate peace treaty. This series of events is the process of the U.S. arming Japan, and it is also the U.S.'s consistent policy towards Japan.

(III) Resolutely Oppose the U.S. Separate "Peace Treaty" with Japan and the Rearmament of Japan

The people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of Asian countries exchanged their blood and sacrifice for the victory in the war against Japan, and today the United States is rearming Japan with its separate "peace treaty" with Japan to be hostile to China and the Asian people, seriously threatening the security of China and other Asian countries. Therefore, the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of Asia resolutely oppose the U.S. separate "peace treaty" with Japan and its crime of rearming Japan. At the same time, the Japanese people are also launching a fierce movement demanding national independence and opposing the U.S. separate "peace treaty" with Japan. The reason why the Japanese people want to oppose the U.S. separate "peace treaty" with Japan is because this "treaty" directly harms the interests of the Japanese people. More than 60% of Japan's annual national expenditure is used for rearming military expenses, so the people have to bear extremely heavy taxes every year. Take 1949 as an example! The total amount of Japan's national expenditure in that year accounted for 60% of the national income. Therefore, the lives of the general workers and peasants are very painful. Let's take the year when the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea! Due to the huge expenditure of the Japanese national treasury and the result of compressing civilian production in order to supply the U.S. military needs, Japan's prices have soared. Japan's prices in April this year have risen by 50% compared with before the outbreak of the Korean War in June last year, while workers' wages have increased by only 9% on average. In order to maintain their lives, many workers have to sell their blood, some even selling blood twice a week until they die from excessive blood loss; some desperately work overtime to earn more wages, and some workers' extra working hours even increase to six hours a day. The same is true for farmers. At present, the burden of donations and taxes has averaged about a quarter of farmers' income. All the grain harvested by farmers through hard work every year, except for rations, is purchased by the government at a price that is half the cost, and some farmers have to buy grain from the black market to make up for the shortfall because the purchase amount is too high. Small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators are also in a desperate situation due to the continuous compression of people's purchasing power and the bankruptcy of peaceful industries. In 1949, 270,000 small and medium-sized industries across the country were forced to close down or change their professions. Therefore, the Japanese people have never stopped fighting for improving their own lives and for the peace, democracy, and independence of Japan for six years. Because of this, every act of aggression by U.S. imperialism against the Asian people must first launch a suppression of the Japanese people. Before and after the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Japanese people suffered severe persecution. Twenty-four members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party were illegally deprived of their civil rights, and more than 1,000 progressive newspapers and periodicals were closed down. The people completely lost their freedom of assembly, association, and speech, and the fascist reign of terror once again enveloped Japan. However, the persecution of U.S. imperialism cannot suppress the will of the Japanese people to fight for peace, independence, and democracy. Today, the signature for the conclusion of the Five-Power Peace Pact in Japan has reached more than 5 million; the signature for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty has reached more than 4.6 million. It can also be seen from this that, due to the improvement of the Japanese people's awareness and the strengthening of their strength, the U.S. plan to turn Japan into cannon fodder for invading Asia will inevitably encounter great difficulties. Moreover, due to Japan's own lack of resources and the loss of the colonies on which it has always relied, there are also great limitations on the United States in using Japan's old military industry. Therefore, as long as the Chinese people, the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world unite and fight together to defeat the U.S. imperialist plan of aggression in Asia, victory will surely belong to us!

    武装日本侵略亚洲是美国的一贯政策
    庄涛
    九月四日，美国在旧金山召开了排斥中华人民共和国在外的非法的对日“和会”；八日，又在美国的强制下“通过”了美英等四十八个国家的非法的对日“和约”。中国人民在对日作战中坚持最久、贡献与牺牲最大，在对日和约问题上当然有最大的发言权。美国排斥中苏两国及亚洲其他主要国家对日非法单独媾和的蛮横行为，中国人民不能不表示极大的愤怒。中国人民一贯主张在贯彻波茨坦公告以及其他国际协定的基础上，缔结全面的对日和约，以建立民主的日本，保障亚洲和平，使亚洲十万万以上的人民免除战争的威胁。但是美国和它的附庸国家，在这次对日单独媾和中所追求的中心目标，正是周恩来外交部长在八月十五日所发表的声明中所指出的：“重新武装日本，以便继续和扩大在亚洲的侵略战争，并加紧准备新的世界战争。”美国帝国主义重新武装日本，并利用日本来侵略亚洲的这一罪恶政策，并不是今天才形成的，而是战后美国对日本的一贯政策，也是战后美国世界扩张政策的一个重要组成部分。（一）美国重新武装日本的罪恶意图
    大家都知道，美国参加太平洋反法西斯战争的目的，并不是要消灭日本法西斯，而是要代替日本法西斯，使它自己成为亚洲的主人。因而在第二次世界大战结束以后，美国在东方就阴谋独霸亚洲。但是，第二次世界大战的胜利结束，不仅使世界形势发生了根本的变化，亚洲的形势也发生了根本的变化。中国人民在抗日战争胜利的基础上取得了全国革命的伟大成功，而成为保卫亚洲和平的主要力量，同时亚洲其他殖民地、半殖民地国家的民族解放运动也都在蓬勃发展。美国为了达到它独霸亚洲的目的，便采取各种手段来镇压与阻碍亚洲各国民族解放运动的开展，并妄图逐步完成对我国和苏联的包围，准备发动新的军事冒险，以最后建立它在亚洲的霸权。这样，曾经是亚洲唯一帝国主义国家的日本，便成了美国侵略亚洲最便利的工具。这是因为：
    第一，美国离开亚洲太远，从美国西海岸到朝鲜长达五千海里；而日本则遥对我国的心脏地带与苏联的亚洲疆土，我国和苏联正是亚洲民主力量的堡垒。所以日本所处的地理位置正符合美国的侵略意图。
    第二、正因为日本过去曾经是亚洲唯一的帝国主义国家，而且在第二次世界大战中，由于本土并未变为战场，所受损失不大，所以日本在战后继续保有亚洲最大的海空军设备与军事工业。据美国斯揣克报告，一九四七年日本拥有年产钢锭八百万吨、钢材一千万吨的设备能力。此外还有军港、飞机场、造船厂、汽油库等各种军用设备。这些又是美国发动战争时所必需的。
    第三、日本在第二次大战中，为了维持从我国东北到印尼爪哇这样辽阔战区的海陆作战，以及为准备本土作战，曾经动员到七百万人的最高兵力，占当时日本总人口的将近十分之一，所以日本也是美国在亚洲附庸国中唯一能提供大量炮灰的国家。日本帝国主义在长期侵略战争中还形成了一批为数不少的法西斯军人，可供美国驱使。
    以上所说的日本所处的地理位置，日本旧有的海空军设备，日本的军事工业，可以充当炮灰的日本兵力以及可供美国驱使的日本法西斯军人，都成了美国侵略亚洲所必需依靠的东西。美国帝国主义本身，由于它的战场广阔，供应线长与兵力不足，单依靠它自己是不可能在亚洲发动大规模侵略战争的。所以从它一占领日本的时候起，就怀着武装日本，变日本为侵略亚洲工具的罪恶的意图。
    （二）日本是怎样被武装起来的？
    当麦克阿瑟最初占领日本的时候，一方面由于人民的压力所迫，一方面为了使日本统治阶级就范，曾发出了一系列欺骗性的命令。那就是解散日本海陆军，逮捕以东条为首的战犯，剥夺军国主义分子的公权，在一九四六年四月，还发表了鲍莱的赔偿报告，主张撤除日本重要工业的设备能力。这样造成了日本统治阶级的恐慌与混乱。麦克阿瑟经过在占领初期时对日本统治阶级的暂时的高压政策以后，就逐渐控制了日本。当它初步控制了日本以后，就开始武装日本，变日本为侵略亚洲的工具。
    在一九四七年以来，美国武装日本的政策日益明显了。日本帝国主义是依靠侵略战争发家的，所以日本的工业一向对侵略战争与殖民地的掠夺有着高度的依赖。当日本投降以后，由于失去了战争市场和对殖民地的原料、资金的掠夺，日本的工业几乎趋于瓦解。当日本投降时，日本工矿业的综合生产指数，只有战前的百分之十。本来这时如果澈底改造日本的政治与经济，使日本的工业转而为广大人民服务，那么日本工业将取得真正的繁荣。然而为了恢复日本军事工业以便武装日本，当时美国就采取了完全相反的方针，那就是建设军事基地和恢复军事工业并行发展的方针。一九四七年，日本国家岁出的百分之三十是美国占领费，其中有将近一半用于军事建设，因此就在一九四六和一九四七两年，美国占领军使用了日本钢材、生铁产量的百分之三十以上。这样军事基地的建设推动了军事工业的恢复，军事工业的恢复又扩大了军事基地的建设。到一九四八年，日本的钢材产量，已由一九四六年的五十万吨恢复到一百十一万吨，增加了一倍多。
    在这一修筑军事基地与恢复军事工业的基础上，美国开始重建日本的军队。一九四七年九月，麦克阿瑟命令日本片山内阁，将日本的警察人数由九万三千人增到十二万五千人，超过战前警察总人数的一倍。一九四八年五月，日本又成立了拥有一万人的变相的海军，即海上保安厅。为了便于武装日本，赔偿的计划也越来越缩小了。一九四八年三月，美国提出了斯揣克报告。这一报告把日本赔偿的估价额，减到鲍莱计划的百分之四十。同年五月，又出现了德莱伯报告，这一报告又把日本赔偿的估价额，再进一步减到鲍莱计划的百分之十五。为了起用日本法西斯分子充当它武装日本与奴役日本人民的工具，这时美国开始大量释放战犯。到一九四八年十一月止，只有东条等二十五名战犯被判刑，其他重要战犯，几乎都已放完。其中包括前日寇中国派遣军司令西尾寿造，前日寇满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介。与中国人民有不共戴天之仇的刽子手冈村宁次，也在麦克阿瑟的命令与保护下，由蒋介石送返日本。
    一九四九年以后，美国帝国主义由于本身经济恐慌一天比一天严重，迫切地想夺取亚洲广大的市场，因此它在日本采取了道奇方针，以加速武装日本的过程。道奇方针是美国银行家道奇制订的，它的要点有三：第一就是增加税收，冻结工资，提高劳动强度，把因武装日本而造成的负担都转嫁到日本人民头上，使资本家有利可图，为美国独占资本投资日本开辟道路。所以一九四九年以来，美国私人资本开始迅速地投入日本，控制了日本的煤油、电气、橡胶等工业。第二，借贷款、救济之名，把美国卖不掉的小麦、棉花等商品运到日本后，就折成现款，归美国支配，投入日本各重要部门。这样美国既推销了过剩商品，又控制了日本的铁路、电气通信、电力、钢铁、煤炭、海运、银行等经济命脉。第三，就是集中资金、原料于发展铁路、电信、钢铁、造船等与战争直接有关的基本工业。这样经过道奇方针以后，日本不仅进一步成了美国的殖民地，也进一步成了美国的军事基地。一九四九年日本的钢材产量由一九四八年的一百十一万吨增至二百万吨，扩大了将近一倍。因此在一九四九年五月，美国干脆声明停止赔偿。一九四九年七月，麦克阿瑟更下令开放日本太平洋沿岸的煤油精炼工厂，开始大量提炼汽车、飞机用的汽油。
    随着军事工业的迅速恢复，这时日本军事基地的修筑也已达到相当规模。从日本北面的北海道直到九州南部，到处有美国修筑的空军基地。这些基地已经连成了一个网。其中最大的有本州北部的三泽机场。海军方面除日本旧有的四大军港以外，美国还修筑了不少新的军港。这样到去年六月，美国利用日本的基地发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争。
    美国发动侵朝战争以后，日本完全成了美军的海空基地与军需补给基地。日本本州北部的三泽机场，成了美国太平洋喷气式飞机大队的大本营。美国侵朝空军就是从日本的空军基地出发轰炸朝鲜和平城市和我国东北边境各地的。日本的旧海军基地横须贺，美国公开夸耀是它在珍珠港以西的唯一强大的海军基地。美国侵朝海军就以日本这些军港为根据地，向朝鲜沿岸发动海盗式的袭击。至于日本政治、经济的中心东京，更成了美国侵朝战争的指挥中心。日本的工厂则为美军制造枪炮、子弹、军用卡车、火车头、路轨、桥梁以至罐头、皮鞋、麻袋等的大量军需品。截至最近，美国为侵朝战争向日本工厂发出的订货已达三亿二千万美元。截至去年九月，日本专为美军服务的人员已达十四万人以上。
    由于美国在侵朝战争中连续遭到严重的挫败，因此自今年一月以来，美国便派杜勒斯四出活动，积极阴谋单独对日媾和，以便在合法的形式下大规模地武装日本，公开把日本的兵力作为美国侵略亚洲的炮灰。所以这半年来，杜勒斯不惜用尽各种威胁利诱的无耻手段，压迫它的附庸国家附和它的单独对日媾和的阴谋。
    日本就是这样在美国帝国主义的统治下，逐步武装起来的。开始，美国为控制日本而对日本统治阶级实施暂时的高压政策，接着初步控制日本以后，就着手武装，然后进而利用日本作为侵朝基地，一直到今天更准备经过单独媾和，把日本变为它侵略亚洲的工具，这一连串就是美国武装日本的过程，也是美国对日本的一贯政策。（三）坚决反对美国单独对日“和约”
    与重新武装日本
    中苏两国人民和亚洲各国人民曾以自己的流血牺牲，换得对日战争的胜利，而美国今天又以其单独对日“和约”来重新武装日本，以与中国与亚洲人民为敌，严重地威胁着中国和亚洲各国的安全，因此，中苏两国人民与亚洲人民坚决反对美国单独对日“和约”及其重新武装日本的罪行。同时，日本人民也正在炽烈展开要求民族独立、反对美国单独对日“和约”的运动。日本人民所以要反对美国单独对日“和约”，就是因为这个“和约”是直接损害日本人民的利益的。日本每年国家开支的百分之六十以上用于重新武装的军事费用，因此人民每年要担负极重的捐税。拿一九四九年来说，该年日本国家的开支总额，竟占全国国民所得的百分之六十。因此一般工农的生活都非常痛苦。拿美国发动侵朝战争的一年间来说吧！由于日本国库开支浩大，以及为供应美国军事需要而压缩民需生产的结果，造成日本物价飞腾，今年四月的日本物价，已比去年六月朝鲜战争爆发前上涨百分之五十，而工人的工资平均仅上涨百分之九。不少工人为了维持生活，不得不出卖自己的鲜血，有的甚至每星期卖二次血，一直到抽血过多而死亡；有的为多得一点工钱拼命加班，有的工人的额外劳动时间甚至加到每天六小时。农民也是一样，目前捐税的负担已平均占农民收入的四分之一左右。农民每年辛勤劳动所收获的粮食，除口粮外，全部由政府以低于成本一半的价格征购，有的农民因征购额太高，不得不向黑市买进粮食以弥补缺额。中小工商业者由于人民购买力被不断压缩，和平工业破产，也弄得走头无路。一九四九年全国有二十七万家中小工业被迫停闭或转业。所以日本人民六年来从未停止过为改善本身生活，为争取日本的和平、民主、独立而进行的斗争。正因为如此，美国帝国主义每一个对亚洲人民的侵略行动，同时必首先发动对日本人民的镇压。在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争的前后，日本人民曾遭受严重的迫害。日本共产党的二十四位中央委员被非法的剥夺公权，一千余家进步报刊被封闭。人民完全失去了集会、结社与言论的自由，法西斯的恐怖统治重又笼罩着日本。但是美国帝国主义的迫害丝毫不能压制日本人民为和平、独立、民主而斗争的意志。今天日本要求缔结五大国和平公约的签名已达五百余万人；要求缔结全面和约的签名已达四百六十余万人。从这里也可以看出，由于日本人民的觉悟提高与力量壮大，美国要把日本变成侵略亚洲的炮灰的计划，必将遭遇极大的困难。而且由于日本本身资源贫乏，又失去了一向所依赖的殖民地，美国在利用日本帝国主义旧有的军事工业上，也有极大的限制。所以只要中国人民，日本人民亚洲人民以及全世界人民团结起来，共同为击溃美国帝国主义在亚洲的侵略计划而斗争，那么胜利一定是属于我们的！
