    My ideological transformation over the past two years
    Zhu Jisheng

    Before liberation, I fancied myself a man of integrity, believing myself to be an industrialist and businessman without political affiliations. In the twenty-eight years of struggling to manage Renli Industrial Company, despite repeatedly competing with foreign businesses, my view was merely "industry for industry's sake, commerce for commerce's sake." I firmly believed that "industry could save the country," so I worked hard to produce and sell carpets and other handicrafts to earn foreign exchange. Later, I also wove woolen fabrics to resist foreign goods and stem financial losses. However, I failed to deeply understand the fundamental reasons for China's poverty and weakness. While fighting against foreign businesses, I also advocated borrowing funds from the United States and Britain to establish domestic industrial and mining enterprises. This proved that my understanding of the nature of imperialism was not clear enough.

    I studied in the United States for five years, and I unknowingly became poisoned by American imperialism. However, I was a patriot. When I returned to China after my studies, I was eager to do something for my country. I still remember: on my way back home, I eagerly looked forward to seeing the long-lost scenery of my motherland, but when I arrived at Wusongkou and the Huangpu River, I saw almost all foreign flags and foreign warships. I was very distressed. And when I got to the dock, the people who inspected the luggage were arrogant foreign customs officers, which made me even more sad and angry. However, at that time, I only hated the Japanese, British, and French invaders, and still had illusions about the United States. I did not know that it was the most insidious and vicious imperialist country. This pro-American and pro-American ideology existed until the time of liberation. Thinking about it now, I feel ashamed.

    During the warlord era and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the corruption of the government and the filth of society made me very disappointed. But I had trans-political, trans-class views, and lacked the courage for revolutionary struggle. Even during the occupation of Tianjin, I stayed in Tianjin, without struggling myself, and waited for the arrival of victory. After the Japanese surrender, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, politics were bad and the economy was chaotic, but I still held a reformist attitude towards national affairs, which was another big mistake.

    I thank my friend Liu Renshu (currently the manager of Tianjin Enterprise Company). Several months before the liberation of Tianjin, he sent me a long letter of more than ten pages from Shijiazhuang, detailing the new democratic economic policy, advising us industrialists and businessmen not to move around rashly, and pointing out the bright future of private enterprises after liberation. Although many of the things said in the letter were in line with my wishes, I still had some concerns and doubts.

    Tianjin was liberated, and the songs of victory awakened me. I personally saw the strict discipline and kind attitude of the People's Liberation Army. They loved each other with the children and played and sang together. More than a dozen young and lively soldiers lived in my house, and we got along very well. Over time, we became like a family. I went to my factory and saw that the workers had also become lively. However, in the early days of liberation, due to transportation difficulties, business declined sharply. Other factories had the same situation, and some even had serious labor-management disputes. I still remember that at that time, the managers of large factories in Tianjin gathered at the Industrial Association every afternoon to chat, and almost everyone had a belly full of complaints. We should thank Li Zhinan (currently the Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China). At that time, he came to the Industrial Association once or twice every week to understand our situation and help us solve various difficulties. We learned the correct policies of the Chinese Communist Party from him, and learned a lot of new knowledge from him. Our mood slowly improved, and our thinking gradually progressed.

    Three months after the liberation of Tianjin, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi personally came to Tianjin despite his busy schedule and held two long symposiums with the heads of several large enterprises. I was fortunate enough to participate. His sincere attitude moved me, and his profound explanations enlightened me. My emotions became more stable and turned to be positive. I once said to my factory employees: "I am fifty-six years old. The first twenty-eight years were my education period; the next twenty-eight years I worked almost entirely at Renli Industrial Company; now that we are liberated, our future is bright. I will live at least another twenty-eight years, study hard, and work with my comrades to expand our factory and build our great motherland." At that time, in order to support the government's policies and help the country's foreign exchange supply, I consulted the directors of Renli Industrial Company and voluntarily reported and registered a large sum of US dollars abroad to the People's Government, and transferred most of it back to the Bank of China. Subsequently, my colleagues and I jointly planned to build a new-style dried egg factory. In the process of preparing for the establishment of the factory, we received various encouragement and assistance from the government. We purchased a lot of steel equipment in Shenyang, but due to traffic congestion, we could not transport it to Tianjin for a while, and it seemed that the construction of the egg factory would be seriously delayed. I asked the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee for help. That night, Director Li Gengtao agreed to telegram relevant departments in Shenyang to find a way to transport our equipment to Tianjin as soon as possible, and I told him the tonnage. The next morning, I found that the tonnage I reported was wrong, and immediately called the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee to correct it. The Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee replied that their telegram had already been sent out at night. A few days later, the goods arrived. This shows how responsible the people's own government is! How quickly they do things! My confidence in our government has been strengthened since then.

    In the autumn of 1949, my colleagues in the industrial and commercial circles and I went to Dalian to visit the large-scale industrial exhibition and many factories. In Dalian, I participated in the celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The People's Square in Dalian seemed like a sea of red. The beautiful five-star red flag fluttered in the warm sunlight and refreshing sea breeze. Cheers were thunderous, and everyone was of one mind. I also shouted from the bottom of my heart: "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao!" When passing through Shenyang, we inspected several large factories. Dalian and Shenyang were liberated earlier, and the industry was relatively developed. The brilliant achievements of the democratic management system in the factories, as well as the practical manifestations of the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, educated me. I deeply realized the wisdom and strength of the proletariat; I also realized that industrialists and businessmen must rely on the masses in order to develop production and improve management well.

    In the spring of 1950, our factory also established a labor-management consultation meeting system. From then on, personnel welfare, safety and hygiene, production plans, and savings issues can be resolved through consultation meetings. At the meeting, the words and deeds of the union representatives often gave me a good education. The reason why our factory's production has been able to successfully shift from clothing wool to industrial wool over the past two years is due to the protection of the government's trade policy, the support and guidance of various user factories, and the active cooperation of our factory's employees, their efforts to improve technology, and improve quality. Recently, our factory launched a patriotic labor competition, which further improved the production mood of employees, created some new records, and produced labor models. Only under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China can the potential abilities of workers be brought into play!

    On the eve of the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, I still harbored fears of the United States, but the surging patriotic upsurge overwhelmed all my concerns, and I enthusiastically participated in the patriotic demonstrations and parades of the industrial and commercial circles and other circles in Tianjin. When we were praised by Chairman Mao, how glorious and excited I felt! I also participated in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, and witnessed the bloody crimes of burning, killing, raping, and looting committed by American imperialism in Korea, which made me hate, despise, and despise American imperialism even more. On the one hand, I saw the brutality, shamelessness, corruption, and depravity of the American bandits; on the other hand, I saw the heroic and strong, unyielding will of the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, as well as the spirit of perseverance, heroic struggle, and bloodshed sacrifice of the Chinese People's Volunteers. My confidence in the inevitable victory of this just war to resist America was greatly strengthened. This collective life, the life of marching, the life of the countryside, and the life of the battlefield gave me great training and testing in thought and spirit. In the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, the spirit of unity and mutual assistance and the style of consultation and criticism deeply moved me. At the same time, I also experienced the importance of leadership and discipline. Korea is a big classroom, and I learned a lot there and gained a lot. After returning from Korea, the movement to donate airplanes and cannons was launched. In order to actively respond to the call of the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea, Ling Qijun, a colleague from Renli Industrial Company who participated in the delegation with me, voluntarily donated the first airplane on behalf of Renli Industrial Company when we were in Beijing. When I gave reports on my visit to Korea in Beijing, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, Handan, and other places, the vivid reactions and patriotic enthusiasm of the audience moved and inspired me. I also realized that the people of the motherland today have truly stood up.

    The new society creates a new family. After liberation, my wife, Sun Banlu, also participated in the Family Women's Federation and the Democratic National Construction Association. She helped establish and operate the nursery of the Family Women's Federation. She also encouraged me before I went to Korea. At the beginning of the movement to donate airplanes and cannons, she took the lead in donating. Now she is helping with the preparations for the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition. My daughter, who just graduated from Yenching University, also voluntarily obeyed the government's unified assignment. The youngest boy, when he graduated from junior high school, although he was too young and did not meet the regulations, also wanted to sign up to participate in the military cadre school. When the children came home, they often talked and exchanged learning experiences and work experiences happily together. Sometimes my wife Banlu and I also participated. Chairman Mao's education for the younger generation makes parents completely assured. Not only that, but I can also learn from my children, and they often unceremoniously criticize my mistakes.

    I feel that I have not studied enough. Although I strive to make progress in the Democratic National Construction Association and in practical work, I always feel very empty. I still have many shortcomings that need to be overcome. I must humbly learn, work hard, strive for progress, and devote the energy of my remaining years to fighting for the construction of a new China!

    我两年余来的思想转变
    朱继圣
    解放以前，我自鸣清高，自以为是一个没有政治色彩的工商业者。在仁立实业公司惨淡经营的二十八年中，虽一再和外商竞争，但我的观点仅仅是“为工业而工业，为商业而商业”的。我深信“工业可以救国”，所以努力制销地毯等工艺货品，以争取外汇。继又织造呢绒哔叽，以抵制外货，杜塞漏卮。但是我不能深刻了解中国贫弱的根本原因，我在与外商斗争的同时，还主张借用美英资金来建立国内的工矿事业，这证明了我对帝国主义本质的认识是不够清楚的。
    我曾在美国留学五年，我不知不觉地中了美帝国主义的毒。但是我是一个爱国分子，留学回国时，很想为祖国做一番事业。我还记得：我在回国途中，热望再见久别的祖国风光，但一到吴淞口及黄浦江时，所见的几乎都是外国旗子和外国轮舰，我很痛心；及到码头，检查行李的，却又是傲慢的外国关员，我更伤心愤怒。但是，那时我所仇恨的，仅仅是日本、英国和法国侵略者，对美国还存在着幻想，还不知道它是最阴险最毒辣的帝国主义者，这个崇美亲美的思想，一直存在到解放的时候。至今思之，自觉惭愧。
    在军阀时代和国民党反动派统治时期，政府的腐朽和社会的污浊，使我非常失望。但我有着超政治、超阶级的观点，毫无革命斗争的勇气。即在天津沦陷期间，也留在天津，不自奋斗，而坐待胜利的到来。日寇投降以后，在国民党反动政府统治之下，政治恶劣，经济紊乱，但我对国事还抱着改良主义的态度，这又是一个很大的错误。
    我谢谢我的朋友刘仁术（现任天津市企业公司经理）。他在天津解放前的几个月，从石家庄转给我一封十几页的长信，详述了新民主主义的经济政策，劝告我们工商业者千万不要迁移乱动，并指明了解放后私营企业的光明前途。信内所说的种种，虽多合乎我的愿望，但我还存在着好些顾虑和疑惑。
    天津解放了，胜利的歌声唤起了我。我亲眼看见了人民解放军严明的纪律与和蔼的态度，他们与孩子们彼此相爱，共同玩唱。十几个年青活泼的战士曾住在我的家中，我们相处甚好，日久更像一家人一样了。我到我的工厂，看见工人们也活泼起来。但在解放初期，由于运输困难，营业锐减。别的工厂，也有同样的情况，有的更发生了严重的劳资纠纷。我还记得，那时天津大工厂的经理们天天下午到工业会聚首闲谈，几乎个个都有一肚子的牢骚。我们应该感谢李之楠（现任中共天津市委会统战部副部长），那时，他每星期都来工业会一两次，了解我们的情况，帮助我们解决各种的困难。我们从他那里懂得了中国共产党的正确政策，向他学习了好些新的知识，我们的情绪就慢慢地好转过来，我们的思想也逐渐进步了。
    天津解放三个月后，刘少奇副主席不辞辛苦地亲来天津，与几个大企业的负责人举行了两次时间甚长的座谈，我很幸运地也参加了。他诚恳的态度，感动了我；他深刻的讲解，启发了我。我的情绪更加稳定而转向积极了。我曾对我厂职工们说过：“我年已五十六了。头二十八年是我教养的时期；后二十八年我几乎全在仁立实业公司工作；现在解放了，我们前途光明，我至少还要活二十八年，努力学习，和同志们在一起来扩大我们的工厂，建设我们伟大的祖国。”当时，为了拥护政府的政策和帮助国家外汇的供应，我商请了仁立实业公司的董事，自动把存在国外的一大笔美金向人民政府报告登记，并把其中的极大部分调回到中国银行。随后，我与同事们共同计划建立一个新式的干蛋工厂。在筹设该厂当中，我们得到了政府的种种鼓励和协助。我们在沈阳采购了好些钢铁器材，但因运输拥挤，一时无法运到天津，眼看着就要严重地延误蛋厂的建设。我向天津市财政经济委员会请求帮助，当晚李耕涛主任应允电沈阳有关部门，设法把我们的器材尽先运到天津，我就把吨数告诉了他。翌晨我发现我所报的吨数错了，马上打电话向天津市财政经济委员会更正，天津市财政经济委员会回答说他们的电报已经在夜里拍出了。过了几天，货也到了。这可见人民自己的政府多么负责！他们办事多么迅速！我对我们政府的信心，从此更加坚定了。
    一九四九年的秋天，我和工商界同仁们到大连去，参观了规模宏大的工业展览会和好些工厂。在大连，我曾参加了中华人民共和国成立的庆祝大会。大连人民的广场，好像一片红色的海，美丽的五星红旗飘扬在和暖的日光和清爽的海风当中，欢声雷震，万众一心，我也从未有地由心里发出了欢呼：“中国共产党万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！毛主席万岁！”路过沈阳时，我们考察了几个大的工厂。大连、沈阳两市解放较先，工业比较发达，工厂里民主管理制度的辉煌成就，以及工人的积极性和创造性的实际表现，都教育了我。我深深地认识了无产阶级的智慧和力量；我也体会了从事工商业者，必须依靠群众，才能好好地发展生产，改善经营。
        一九五○年的春天，我厂也建立了劳资协商会议的制度。从此，人事福利、安全卫生、生产计划以及节约等问题，都可以通过协商会议来求得解决。在会议上，工会代表们的言行，常常给我以很好的教育。两年来，我厂生产所以能够胜利地由服装用呢转向工业用呢，是由于政府贸易政策的保护，和各用户工厂的支持和指导，以及我厂职工们的积极合作、努力改进技术、提高品质的结果。最近，我厂展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛，更进一步地提高了职工的生产情绪，创造了一些新的纪录，出现了劳动模范。只有在中国共产党正确领导之下，才能把工人潜在的能力发挥出来！
    抗美援朝运动发动的前夕，我还存着恐美思想，但汹涌澎湃的爱国高潮淹没了我一切的顾虑，我踊跃地参加了天津工商界和其他各界的爱国示威大游行。当我们得到毛主席赞许的时候，我感到何等光荣！何等兴奋！我又参加了中国人民赴朝慰问团，耳闻目睹了美帝国主义在朝鲜所犯的烧、杀、淫、掠等血腥罪行，使我对美帝国主义更加仇视、鄙视和蔑视。我一方面看见了美国强盗的残暴无耻和腐朽堕落；另一方面看见了朝鲜人民军和朝鲜老百姓的英勇坚强、不屈不挠的意志，以及中国人民志愿军的坚苦卓绝、英勇奋斗和流血牺牲的精神，我对这个抗美正义战争必胜的信心大大地加强了。这次集体的生活，行军的生活，农村的生活和战地的生活，不论在思想上和精神上，都给了我以极大的锻炼和考验。在中国人民赴朝慰问团内，大家团结与互助的精神和协商与批评的作风，深深地感动了我，同时我也体验到领导与纪律的重要。朝鲜是一个大课堂，我在那里学习了不少东西，收获很大。从朝鲜归来以后，捐献飞机大炮的运动展开了，我为了积极响应抗美援朝总会的号召，我和一起参加慰问团的仁立实业公司同事凌其峻在北京时即代表仁立实业公司自觉自愿地捐献了头一架飞机。我在北京、保定、石家庄、邢台、邯郸等处作赴朝慰问报告的时候，听众们生动的反应和爱国的热忱感动了我，鼓舞了我；我也体会到今日的祖国人民真是已经站起来了。
    新的社会造成新的家庭。解放后，我的爱人孙班录也参加了家庭妇女联谊会和民主建国会。对家庭妇女联谊会的托儿所，她曾帮助设立，也帮助经营。我去朝鲜前，她也鼓励了我。在捐献飞机大炮运动开始时，她就带头认捐。现在她正帮助进行华北区城乡物资交流展览会的准备工作。刚在燕京大学毕业的女儿也自愿服从政府的统一分配；最幼的男孩在初中毕业时，虽年纪太小，不合规定，也想去报名参加军事干部学校。儿女回家时，常常愉快地在一起谈论，交流学习的经验和工作的体会，有时我与我的爱人班录也参加了。毛主席对于青年一代的教养，使父母们完全可以放心。不仅如此，我还可以向儿女们学习，他们也常不客气地批评我的错误。
    我自觉学习不够，虽在民主建国会里和实际工作当中努力来求进步，但总感觉非常空虚。我还有不少缺点，尚待克服。我还要虚心学习，努力工作，来争取进步，尽我余生的精力，为建设新中国而奋斗！
