    The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Hebei Province inspected and summarized the work of increasing production and donations in the entire special district in late August. In the past three months, the donation campaign in Tangshan Special District has been successful. The people of various counties and the staff of the directly subordinate organs of the special district have pledged more than 15.4 billion yuan in Renminbi, exceeding the value of ten fighter planes. Among them, the pledged amounts in Luan County, Funing, Qian'an, Leting, Fengnan, Yutian, and Fengrun counties each exceeded or reached the value of one fighter plane. The total amount of payments has reached more than 6.097 billion yuan. The movement is still developing. At the beginning of the movement, a widespread publicity and education campaign was launched throughout the special district. In June, all counties in the region except Linyu held anti-US and aid-Korea representative conferences presided over by the Secretary of the CPC County Committee and Director of the Resist-US and Aid-Korea Branch, made resolutions on carrying out the donation movement, and formulated plans for increasing production and donations. In July, most villages in the region launched a campaign to increase production and donations.

    Judging from the inspection results at the end of August, although the current donation campaign has achieved the above-mentioned results, the following problems still exist:

    First, the development of the movement is uneven. In counties such as Luan County, Funing, Fengnan, Lulong, and Linyu, the popularity of the donation movement has almost reached every village and household. However, among the 580 villages in Fengrun County, 160 villages have not yet started this movement. The donation amounts also vary greatly between some counties and districts. For example, the population and economic conditions of Luannan and Zunhua counties are similar, but the pledged and paid amounts in Zunhua County are less than one-tenth of those in Luannan County. In the third district of Fengrun County, people from all walks of life pledged 110 million yuan and have actually paid 42 million yuan, but in the eighth district, the original pledge was 37.15 million yuan, and now only 360,000 yuan have been paid. Of course, absolutely average donation figures cannot and should not be advocated, but in areas with equal or similar economic and other conditions, the development of the movement should not be too different. Therefore, the donation movement in various places should seek a generally balanced development or a relatively balanced development, otherwise it will cause the enthusiastic masses in some areas to donate amounts exceeding their ability, affecting production and life; while the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses in other areas will not be fully utilized.

    Second, although the phenomenon of coercion and command in the movement has been repeatedly criticized and corrected by the leading organs, it continues to occur in some areas as the scope of the movement expands. At the beginning of the donation movement, the leading organs at all levels generally paid attention to publicity and education work to prevent the occurrence of coercion and command, so that the donation work did play a role in raising the political awareness of the masses and promoting production. However, deviations still occurred in some villages. For example, He Shaowen, the village chief of He Zhuangzi Village in the Fourth District of Luan County, said when mobilizing the masses to donate: "It won't work if you donate too little this time, three or two thousand is not worth writing down." Cadres in Hou Zhuangzi Village rigidly stipulated the minimum amount of donation for the masses. Cadres in Xin Zhuangzi Village first "planned" how much each person should donate, and then let the masses report themselves, and would not write it down if the reported figure did not reach the number they "planned." After the county and district leading organs criticized and corrected the deviations in these villages, similar phenomena occurred successively in some newly started villages. For example, in Da Wangzhuang in the Eighth District of Yutian, 5,000 yuan was apportioned per person according to the population. The donation figures for students at Da Wan Liushu Elementary School in the First District were calculated according to grade, 1,000 yuan for first grade, 3,000 yuan for third grade, and so on. This shows that correcting the coercive and commanding style of lower-level cadres is a task that requires constant attention. Only when the leading organs constantly conduct inspections, earnestly carry out education when deviations are found, and correct them in a timely manner can the movement be carried out smoothly.

    Third, donation work is a long-term political task for half a year. Some county and district leading cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of this and treat it as a blitz task, resulting in a serious phenomenon of being tight at the beginning and loose at the end. In the early stage of the donation movement, the counties generally grasped it tightly, mobilizing from top to bottom in a timely manner, holding meetings, making resolutions, and issuing instructions. After the work was launched, they paid attention to inspection, thus quickly setting off a mass movement of increasing production and donations throughout the special district. However, in July, especially after entering August, some counties relaxed or abandoned their leadership over the donation movement, blindly believing that: the broad masses had already pledged donation figures and made plans; the masses' patriotic enthusiasm was high, and they could complete the task sooner or later. For example, the leading organs of some counties did not understand the development of the movement for a long time, and even did not know the donation figures. Some counties transferred all the cadres managing donation work, and no one handled the daily work in the movement. Some counties knew that the donation work had stagnated, but did not actively try to promote it. What is especially noteworthy is that some counties only made resolutions on carrying out the donation work at the representative conference, while neglecting the specific leadership in the work, causing the donation work to fall into a state of drift. Some cadres even opposed the work of increasing production and donations to the current central task, believing that "the central work is so busy, how can there be time to do donations?" This seriously affected the healthy development of the donation movement. If this phenomenon is not corrected in time, it will not be possible to ensure the completion of the donation task, and even if the donation figures can be completed, it will reduce the political significance of the donation movement and lose the major role of continuing to improve the masses' awareness through the donation movement and promoting the current economic and cultural construction.

    In response to the above situation, the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed at the meeting of county committee members reporting their work in early September that the party committees at all levels must follow the instructions issued by the prefectural committee and the special district's Resist-US and Aid-Korea Branch on the donation work to achieve balanced development and the notice issued by the National Resist-US and Aid-Korea Federation on August 21 regarding the implementation of the plan to increase production and donations and pay donations on schedule. In September, special meetings should be held for discussion, and in conjunction with various tasks, in-depth communication, mobilization and comprehensive inspection should be carried out to promote people from all walks of life to realize the plan to increase production and donations on schedule and earnestly correct the current shortcomings. For districts and villages that have not yet carried out this movement, leadership should be strengthened, plans should be made quickly, and the movement should be launched; in areas where the masses have not been mobilized to formulate plans to increase production and donations, supplements should be re-ordered. For donation plans with excessively high targets proposed by some activists, after praising their patriotic enthusiasm, they should be appropriately advised to revise them so that the donation amount fully adapts to their economic conditions and living standards. In places where coercion, command and apportionment have occurred, cadres should be urged to re-launch this work, resolutely correct deviations, and educate the broad masses to correctly understand this movement.

    唐山专区检查捐献工作中发现的几个问题
    贺炳章、周振华、袁渤、平权
    中共河北省唐山地方委员会在八月底检查、总结了全专区前一阶段的增产捐献工作。三个月来，唐山专区的捐献运动是有成绩的。各县人民和专区直属机关工作人员，已认捐人民币一百五十四亿元以上，超过了十架战斗机的价值，其中滦县、抚宁、迁安、乐亭、丰南、玉田、丰润等七县的认捐数各超过或达到了一架战斗机的价值。缴款总额已达六十亿九千七百余万元。现在运动仍继续发展中。运动开始时，全专区曾普遍展开了宣传教育工作。六月间，除临榆外，全区各县都在中共县委书记兼抗美援朝分会主任的主持下召开了抗美援朝代表会议，作出了开展捐献运动的决议，制订了增产捐献计划。七月份，全区绝大部分村庄都开展了增产捐献运动。
    从八月底的检查结果来看，目前的捐献运动虽然有了上述成绩，但还存在着下列几个问题：
    第一，运动的发展不平衡。滦县、抚宁、丰南、卢龙、临榆等县，捐献运动的普及程度几已达到村村户户；而丰润县的五百八十个村中，尚有一百六十个村没有搞起这一运动。部分县、区之间，捐献数目也相差很大。例如滦南、遵化两县的人口和经济条件都相差不多，而遵化县的认捐数字与缴款数字都不到滦南县的十分之一。丰润县第三区各界人民认捐达一亿一千万元，已实缴四千二百万元，但第八区原认捐三千七百十五万元，现在仅缴三百六十万元。当然，捐献数字不能也不应该提倡绝对平均，但在经济条件和各方面条件相等或相近的地区，运动的发展是不应该相差太远的。因此，各地的捐献运动应当求得一般地平衡发展或比较地平衡发展，不然便会使某些地区热情很高的人民群众，捐献数额超过他们的能力，影响生产和生活；而另一些地区人民群众的爱国热情，却得不到充分的发挥。
    第二，运动中的强迫命令现象，虽然经过领导机关一再批评和纠正，但随着运动面的扩大，某些地区还在不断发生。捐献运动开始时，各级领导机关一般是注意了宣传教育工作，防止发生强迫命令现象，因而使捐献工作确实起了提高群众政治觉悟和推动生产的作用。但有些村庄仍然发生了偏向。如滦县四区何庄子村村长何绍文在动员群众捐献时说：“这回少了可不行，三千两千值不得动笔。”侯庄子村干部硬性规定群众捐献的最低额。新庄子村干部首先“计划”好谁要捐多少，然后由群众自报，报不到他们“计划”的数字就不给写。当县、区领导机关批评和纠正了这些村庄的偏向之后，在另外一些运动新开始的村庄又相继发生了类似的现象。如玉田八区大王庄实行按人口每人摊派五千元。一区大湾柳树完全小学的学生，捐献数字按年级计算，一年级一千元，三年级三千元，依此类推。这说明了要纠正下层干部的强迫命令作风，是一件需要经常注意的工作。只有领导机关不断地进行检查，发现偏向时认真进行教育，及时纠正，才能使运动顺利开展。
    第三，捐献工作是半年间的长期政治任务，有些县、区领导干部对此认识不足，而把它当作一个突击任务来作，因而发生了严重的前紧后松现象。在捐献运动的初期，各县一般都抓得很紧，及时地从上而下进行动员，召开会议，作出决议，发出指示；工作开展后并注意检查，因而迅速地掀起了全专区的群众性的增产捐献运动。但至七月份特别是进入八月份以后，有些县就放松或放弃了对捐献运动的领导，盲目地认为：广大群众已经自认了捐献数字，作出了计划；群众的爱国热情高，早晚也可完成任务。如有的县领导机关长时间不了解运动的发展情况，甚至连捐献数字也不知道。有的县把管理捐献工作的干部抽调一空，运动中的日常工作没有人处理。有的县明明知道捐献工作已经停滞不前，也不积极设法推进。尤其值得注意的，是有的县只在代表会上作出了开展捐献工作的决议，而忽略了工作中的具体领导，致使捐献工作陷于自流状态。还有某些干部把增产捐献工作与当前的中心任务对立起来，认为“中心工作这么忙，那有时间搞捐献哪”。这样，就严重地影响了捐献运动的健全发展。这种现象如不及时纠正，将不能保证捐献任务的完成，即使能完成捐献数字，也将减低捐献运动的政治意义，失去通过捐献运动继续提高群众觉悟程度，推动当前经济建设与文化建设的重大作用。
    针对上述情况，中共唐山地委在九月初各县县委委员汇报工作的会议上提出：各级党委必须按照地委和专区抗美援朝分会发出的关于捐献工作必须作到平衡发展的指示和抗美援朝总会八月二十一日发出的关于执行增产捐献计划，按期缴纳捐款的通知，在九月份召开专门会议进行讨论，并结合各种工作，进行一次深入的传达动员和全面检查，推动各界人民按期实现增产捐献计划，认真纠正当前的各种缺点。对于尚未开展这一运动的区、村，应加强领导，迅速地作出计划，开展这一运动；没有发动群众订立增产捐献计划的地区，应重新补订。对于某些积极分子提出的目标过高的捐献计划，要在表扬其爱国热情之后，适当地劝其修正，使捐献数目完全适应他们的经济条件与生活水平。对发生了强迫命令与摊派现象的地方，应督促干部重新去开展这一工作，坚决纠正偏向，教育广大群众正确地认识这一运动。
