Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th: Our front-line correspondent reports: From September 6th to 10th, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to inflict heavy losses on the invading enemy, eliminating over 5,200 enemy troops. In the skies over the front and the rear, our forces shot down or damaged 52 enemy aircraft, including six bombers shot down at night. In addition, our forces destroyed three enemy tanks.

	In the western front area, after our forces annihilated five U.S. companies in a local attack, the enemy hastily assembled over 2,000 infantry and 40 tanks, and under the cover of a large number of aircraft, continuously attacked the Western Hill, Doliu Peak, and Baideri front-line mountains that our forces had recently captured. A certain unit of our forces bravely countered with dense firepower, killing or wounding over 300 U.S. troops in the two days of fighting on the 8th and 9th.

	In the Kimhwa northeast area, another unit of our forces also valiantly repelled enemy attacks on two mountain areas, killing or wounding over 100 of them.

	In the mountainous and highland areas north of Hwacheon, Yanggu, and Inje on the eastern front, a certain unit of our forces continued to fiercely counterattack the invading enemy, often exchanging very small casualties for the victory of annihilating a large number of enemy troops. In a battle for a mountain 1,052 meters high northeast of Yanggu, a small number of our defending forces bravely repelled multiple attacks by an enemy battalion, killing or wounding over 200 of them, while suffering only 17 casualties.

	In order to achieve the goal of annihilating more enemy troops, our forces also conducted seesaw-style repeated contests for some mountain areas. On the 10th, an enemy regiment that frantically invaded the mountain area north of Inje attempted to seize the Huangji and Songyuyue front-line positions in one fell swoop. After inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, a certain unit of our forces took the initiative to transfer its position. On the 11th, our forces launched a heroic counterattack and completely defeated the enemy in four hours of fierce fighting. On the same day, after the enemy pieced together reinforcements, they attacked the area fiercely again. Our forces inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and then took the initiative to transfer. On the 12th, our forces counterattacked again, annihilating most of an enemy battalion in the mountains east of Songyuyue, and the front-line position was immediately returned to our hands. The frantically invading enemy also encountered fierce resistance from our forces in other mountain areas, suffering heavy casualties.

    朝中人民部队五天歼敌五千余
    在前线和后方又击落击伤敌机五十二架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】本社前线记者报道：自九月六日至十日的五天中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军继续痛歼犯敌，歼灭敌军五千二百余名。在前线与后方的上空，我军又击落击伤敌机五十二架，其中六架轰炸机是夜间被击落的。另外，我军并击毁敌坦克三辆。在西线地区，自我军在局部攻击中一举歼灭美军五个连之后，敌人又拼凑步兵二千余人与坦克四十辆在大量飞机的掩护下，连续进攻我攻克不久的西方山、斗流峰、柏德里一线山地。我军某部以密集火力奋勇迎击，在八、九日两天的战斗中，又杀伤美军三百余名。在金化东北地区，我军另部也英勇击退向两个山地进攻的敌军，并杀伤其一百多人。在东线华川、杨口、麟蹄以北的丛山高岭地区，我军某部继续以坚强的反击战痛击犯敌，常常以很小的伤亡换取歼灭大量敌军的胜利。在杨口东北一个高一千零五十二公尺的山地战斗中，我少数守军英勇击退一个营敌军的多次攻击，并杀伤其二百多名，而自己仅伤亡十七人。为了达到歼灭更多的敌军的目的，我军并在有些山地进行拉锯式的反复争夺战。十日，向麟蹄以北山地疯狂窜犯的一个团敌军，妄图一举攻占黄基、松鱼月一线阵地，我军某部给予敌军重大杀伤后，即主动转移阵地。十一日，我军发起英勇反击，在四小时激战中，将敌军全部击溃。当日敌军拼凑补充兵力后，复向该地猛攻，我军予敌重大杀伤后又主动转移。十二日，我军再度反击，在松鱼月以东山地将一个营敌军大部歼灭，该线阵地随即重入我手。疯狂进犯的敌军在其他山地也遭到我军的猛烈抗击，伤亡惨重。
