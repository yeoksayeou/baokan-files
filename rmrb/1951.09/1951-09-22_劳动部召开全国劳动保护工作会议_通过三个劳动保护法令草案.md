Xinhua News Agency, September 20th:

    The Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government convened the first National Labor Protection Work Conference from the 3rd to the 15th of this month. The conference discussed and approved three draft decrees related to labor protection, namely the draft of the Provisional Regulations on Factory Safety and Hygiene, the draft of the Provisional Measures for Restricting Overtime Work in Factories and Mines, and the draft of the Provisional Regulations on the Protection of Female Workers. During the conference, representatives from various regions reported on the progress of labor protection work and exchanged work experiences. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways, Chen Yu, Minister of Fuel Industry, Zhong Lin, Deputy Minister of Heavy Industry, He Cheng, Deputy Minister of Health, and Yi Lirong, Minister of Labor Protection of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended and delivered speeches, introducing the improvements in labor protection and industrial and mining hygiene in various departments over the past two years.

    The conference was summarized by Li Lisan, Minister of Labor. In his summary, Minister Li focused on explaining two issues. First, the principle of formulating labor protection decrees at present must be based on meeting needs while taking possibilities into account. During the Kuomintang rule, factories and mines in our country had almost no safety and hygiene equipment or systems, and the number of worker deaths and injuries or deaths due to illness was very high. Although this situation has improved since liberation, it is still far from meeting actual needs, so further vigorous improvements are urgently needed. On the other hand, due to the very weak foundation of labor protection work inherited from the old society, and under the current restrictions of the country's financial resources and technical equipment, some things that need improvement are difficult to achieve in the short term. Therefore, when formulating decrees, anything that cannot be done at present should not be stipulated. Second, the ideological obstacle to labor protection work at present is that some capitalists, staff, administrative cadres, and engineering technicians in some factories and mines still harbor the view of "only valuing machines and not people," or only valuing production and not safety. The working masses also generally have the habit of not paying attention to safety and hygiene (a habit forced upon them by the old society). Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen publicity and education on labor protection, so that capitalists, staff, and technicians understand that without doing a good job in labor protection, production cannot be improved. It is necessary to educate workers and raise their awareness of labor protection so that they understand that once an accident occurs, it will not only directly endanger their lives, safety, and health, but also affect production and cause losses to the country.

    Since the establishment of the Central People's Government two years ago, all regions have done a lot of work and made great achievements in labor protection, and the number of casualties among employees has been decreasing year by year. The national average monthly death toll in factories and mines in the first half of this year decreased by 28.2 percent compared with the average monthly death toll from May to December last year, and the number of serious injuries decreased by 26.2 percent. In the past two years, in addition to three comprehensive safety inspections in the Northeast, other regions have also conducted key or partial inspections, and promptly improved factory and mine safety work based on the inspection results. The safety equipment within the jurisdiction of the six administrations under the Ministry of Railways has installed more than 7,000 units in the past two years, an increase of four times compared to before liberation. The department plans to spend approximately 100 million catties of grain on labor protection, especially technical safety, this year. Currently, 70 percent of state-owned coal mines in East China and North China have mechanical ventilation equipment. State-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region have generally established technical security departments, with 2,590 cadres specifically responsible for technical security work. However, according to the requirements of the people's government's labor protection policy, the unfavorable situation of factory and mine safety and hygiene left over from old China has not been fundamentally changed nationwide. However, everyone has already noticed the importance of safety and hygiene in their thinking and has actually solved some problems, and this problem will be gradually and comprehensively resolved in the future. Therefore, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government convened this National Labor Protection Work Conference and formulated the above three decrees, in order to further improve labor protection work in various regions based on the decrees.

    劳动部召开全国劳动保护工作会议
    通过三个劳动保护法令草案
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府劳动部于本月三日至十五日召开了第一次全国劳动保护工作会议。会议讨论并通过了三个有关劳动保护的法令草案，即工厂安全卫生暂行条例的草案、限制工厂矿场加班加点暂行办法的草案和保护女工暂行条例的草案。会议期间，各地代表曾汇报劳动保护工作情况，交流工作经验。中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远、燃料工业部部长陈郁、重工业部副部长钟林、卫生部副部长贺诚和中华全国总工会劳动保护部部长易礼容均曾出席讲话，介绍了两年来各部门关于劳动保护工作和工矿卫生工作改进情况。
    会议由劳动部部长李立三作总结。李部长在总结中着重说明两个问题。第一，目前制定劳动保护法令，必须根据这样一个原则：既要满足需要，又要照顾可能。我国各厂矿企业在国民党统治时期几乎没有什么安全卫生设备和安全卫生制度，工人因工伤亡或因病死亡的数字是很大的；这种情况自解放以来虽有改进，但离实际需要还相差很远，因此亟须进一步大力改进。另一方面，由于旧社会遗留下来劳动保护工作的基础很微弱，在目前国家财力和技术设备等条件的限制下，有些虽然需要改进但一时还难以办到，因此在制定法令时，凡目前办不到的即不必规定。第二，目前劳动保护工作的思想障碍，是某些厂矿企业的资本家、职员、行政干部和工程技术人员中还残存着“只重视机器而不重视人”的观点，或只重视生产不重视保安的观点，工人群众中也还普遍存在着不注意安全卫生的习惯（这种习惯是在旧社会被迫养成的）。因此，必须加强劳动保护的宣传教育工作，使资本家、职员、技术人员懂得，不做好劳动保护工作，生产就不可能搞好；要教育工人，提高工人对劳动保护的认识，使工人懂得一旦发生事故，不但直接危害了自己的生命安全和身体健康，还要影响了生产，使国家受到损失。
    按中央人民政府成立两年以来，各地在劳动保护方面都作了很多工作，并有了不少成绩，职工伤亡人数已历年递减。全国各厂矿今年上半年每月平均死亡人数比去年五月至十二月每月平均死亡人数又减少了百分之二十八点二，重伤人数又减少了百分之二十六点二。两年来，除东北进行过三次全面性的保安大检查，其他各地也都进行了重点的或局部的检查，并根据检查结果及时改进厂矿安全工作。铁道部所属关内六个管理局辖区内的安全设备，两年来共安装了七千余处，比解放前增加达四倍之多。该部今年计划用于劳动保护特别是技术安全方面的经费约合一万万斤粮食。目前，华东、华北百分之七十的国营煤矿都有了机械通风设备。东北区国营厂矿已普遍设立了技术保安科，专门负责技术保安工作的干部达二千五百九十余名。但根据人民政府劳动保护政策的要求来说，旧中国遗留下来的厂矿安全卫生的不良情况在全国范围还没有基本改变过来，但大家在思想认识上已经注意到安全卫生的重要，并在实际上解决了一些问题，今后会逐渐地全面地解决这个问题。因此，中央人民政府劳动部特召开此次全国劳动保护工作会议，制定了上述三个法令，以期各地依据法令进一步改进劳动保护工作。
