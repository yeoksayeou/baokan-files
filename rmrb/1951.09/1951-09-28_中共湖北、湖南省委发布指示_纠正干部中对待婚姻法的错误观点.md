    CCP Hubei, Hunan Provincial Committees Issue Instructions
    Correct Erroneous Views on the Marriage Law Among Cadres
    Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, new atmospheres such as freedom of marriage, equality between men and women, and family harmony have begun to emerge in some areas of Hubei. However, interference with women's freedom of marriage and the abuse and maltreatment of women still exist seriously. In the Daye Special District, from January to June this year, 61 women were abused and maltreated to death, and 49 were injured. In the five counties of Baokang, Hongshan, Yicheng, Xiangyang, and Zaoyang in the Xiangyang Special District, 72 women died due to marriage problems in the past year (incomplete statistics). In the seventh district of Jiangling County, three women were forced to death in the four days from July 19 to 22.
    In these abuse cases, some were caused by rural cadres interfering with freedom of marriage. For example, the village chief of the seventh village of Huangyang Township, First District, Hanyang County, did not allow the widow Xiao Dongmei to marry her lover in Hankou but forced her to marry his son. Later, Xiao Dongmei's sister, Da Dongmei (women's committee member of the farmers' association), sent her sister to Hankou to get married. The village chief falsely accused Da Dongmei of colluding with landlords and wanted to expel her from the farmers' association. Da Dongmei had to call her sister back, but Xiao Dongmei insisted on not marrying the village chief's son, and the two sisters were forced to commit suicide by drowning. Some women committed suicide because they could not live due to abuse by their parents-in-law and husbands, and rural cadres did not support them, feeling that they had no way out.
    In order to implement the Marriage Law, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions requiring Party committees at all levels to correct the erroneous views of cadres on the Marriage Law. For example, regarding the Marriage Law as a "divorce law," believing that implementing the Marriage Law would cause "great chaos," would lead to detachment from the masses, and would affect work. Therefore, they dared not publicize the Marriage Law, dared not resolve marriage disputes, and even used various methods to interfere with and suppress the masses' reasonable demands for divorce and marriage. They failed to recognize that the basic spirit and purpose of the Marriage Law were to abolish the feudal marriage system of arranged marriages, forced marriages, male supremacy, and disregard for the interests of children, in order to establish new families that are democratic, harmonious, united, and have happy lives. Some women's reasons for requesting divorce are generally because they are dissatisfied with arranged marriages. This is the public resistance of awakened masses to the old system and should be supported. Therefore, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on cadres at all levels to earnestly study the Marriage Law, criticize various erroneous views, and, in conjunction with various movements, especially the land reform movement, implement the Marriage Law step by step and extensively and thoroughly publicize the Marriage Law to the masses. Only by actively raising the consciousness of the masses, implementing the Marriage Law, abolishing unreasonable marriage systems, and reasonably resolving marriage disputes can the broad masses of men and women, especially the broad masses of women, be liberated from the suffering of the feudal marriage system. Any attitude of compromise towards the feudal marriage system is wrong. At present, the focus of implementing the Marriage Law should be to strictly prohibit the occurrence of incidents of abuse against women and strictly prohibit cadres from interfering with freedom of marriage. Those who interfere should be subject to disciplinary action.
    The instructions pointed out that the implementation of the Marriage Law is a part of new democratic construction. Therefore, this is not only the work of the Women's Federation and government judicial departments but the task of the entire Party. Cadres of the entire Party should be mobilized to implement it under the unified leadership of the Party.
    The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also issued similar instructions, calling on the entire Party to resolutely implement the Marriage Law.

### 中共湖北、湖南省委发布指示  纠正干部中对待婚姻法的错误观点

    中共湖北、湖南省委发布指示
    纠正干部中对待婚姻法的错误观点
    自从婚姻法颁布以来，湖北某些地区已开始出现婚姻自由、男女平等、家庭和睦等新气象。但是干涉妇女婚姻自由与虐待残害妇女的现象仍严重存在。大冶专区自今年一月至六月，妇女被虐待残害致死者六十一人，受伤者四十九人。襄阳专区的保康、洪山、宜城、襄阳、枣阳五县，近一年来因婚姻问题而致死的妇女七十二人（不完全的统计）。江陵县七区自七月十九日至二十二日四天中，妇女被逼死三人。
    在这些被虐害的事件中，有一部分是因乡村干部干涉婚姻自由而造成的。如汉阳县一区黄阳乡七村村长不许寡妇小冬梅与她在汉口的爱人结婚，却强迫她嫁给自己的儿子。后来，小冬梅的姐姐大冬梅（农会妇女委员）送她妹妹到汉口结了婚，村长诬告大冬梅通地主，要把她开除出农会。大冬梅只好把她妹妹叫回来，但小冬梅坚持不和村长的儿子结婚，两姊妹被逼得投塘自杀。也有些妇女因公婆丈夫虐待，无法生活，乡村干部又不给撑腰，感到无路可走而自杀。
    中共湖北省委为贯彻执行婚姻法，特发布了指示，要求各级党委纠正干部对待婚姻法的错误观点。例如把婚姻法当作“离婚法”，以为执行婚姻法就要“大乱”，就要脱离群众，就要影响工作，因而不敢宣传婚姻法、不敢解决婚姻纠纷，甚至用各种方法来干涉压制群众离婚、结婚的合理要求。而未认识到婚姻法的基本精神和目的是废除包办强迫、男尊女卑、漠视子女利益的封建婚姻制度。是为了建立民主和睦团结生活美满的新家庭。有些妇女之所以提出离婚要求，一般是因为不满意包办的婚姻，这是觉悟了的群众对旧制度的公开反抗，应该予以支持。因此，中共湖北省委号召各级干部要认真学习婚姻法，批判各种错误观点，并结合各种运动，首先要结合土地改革运动，有步骤地贯彻执行婚姻法，广泛地深入地向群众宣传婚姻法。只有从积极方面提高群众觉悟，贯彻执行婚姻法，废除不合理的婚姻制度，合理解决婚姻纠纷，才能把广大男女特别是广大妇女从封建婚姻制度的苦痛中解救出来。任何对封建婚姻制度妥协的态度，都是错误的。目前执行婚姻法的重点，应是严禁虐害妇女事件的发生；严禁干部干涉婚姻自由，凡有干涉行为者应受纪律制裁。
    指示中指出：实行婚姻法是新民主主义建设的一部分。因此这不仅是妇联和政府司法部门的工作，而是全党的任务，应在党的统一领导下，动员全党干部贯彻执行。
    中共湖南省委亦发出同样的指示，号召全党坚决贯彻执行婚姻法。
