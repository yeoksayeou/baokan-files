    Editor,
    Comrade Shen Yaowen suddenly had a miscarriage on August 23rd, resulting in severe postpartum hemorrhage, and her condition was extremely critical. When she was sent to North China People's Hospital for treatment, she was already in a coma due to excessive blood loss. At that time, a blood transfusion was urgently needed, but a blood donor could not be found immediately. Zhang Qingling, the director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of the hospital, to save the patient, unhesitatingly performed an auto-transfusion of 150cc of blood, allowing the patient to escape danger. Dr. Zhang's high spirit of serving the people is extremely touching. Other doctors (such as attending physician Dr. Luo Shifang) and nurses in the hospital's Obstetrics and Gynecology Department also demonstrated a high degree of responsibility. This is a manifestation of the excellent qualities of medical workers in New China.
    I remember that more than a year ago, the People's Daily published criticisms from readers about North China People's Hospital. From the specific facts of the hospital's treatment of Comrade Shen Yaowen's illness, it can be seen that the hospital's work has made great progress in the past year.

    华北人民医院产妇科主任自动输血救治了病人编辑同志：
    沈耀文同志在八月二十三日突然流产血崩，情况十分危急。当送入华北人民医院治疗时，她因流血过多，已成昏迷状态。当时亟需输血，而一时又找不到输血人。该院产妇科主任张庆龄大夫为救病人，毫不迟疑地自动输血一百五十西西，病人得以脱离危险。张大夫这种高度为人民服务的精神是十分令人感动的。该院产妇科其他大夫（如主治医师罗世芳大夫）及护士同志们也发扬了高度的负责精神。这是新中国人民医务工作者优良品质的表现。
    记得在一年多以前，人民日报曾经发表过读者对华北人民医院的批评。从该院治疗沈耀文同志疾病的具体事实中可以看出，一年来该院的工作已经有了很大进步。    国际新闻局    孙源
