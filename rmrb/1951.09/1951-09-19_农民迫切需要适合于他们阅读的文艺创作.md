To the Editor:

In the old society, a type of script was popular in the countryside, many written in forms familiar to the people. Such as Peking Opera, Bangzi Opera, etc., each book with only three or two plays, four or five pages thick, selling for only a few copper coins. I remember that these scripts were mostly published by some private bookstores in Beijing. They were welcomed by the vast number of farmers who had a basic understanding of literacy at the time. However, many scripts contained pornographic and reactionary content, bringing much poison to the farmers.

Now, in many larger market towns in the countryside, such book stalls are gone. Most of the books sold in bookstores are thick, with high costs, and the content is not easily accepted by farmers. Some farmers say, "There is nowhere to buy a book." Some people write to friends in the city, asking them to buy old small scripts. Because, in fact, it is impossible for a farmer to run to the city to buy a small book, and it is not necessarily what they like to ask someone to buy it for them. I suggest that the publishing departments pay serious attention to this, and that writers create more works suitable for the needs of farmers, such as novels, short plays, and quick talks that are welcomed by farmers, printed in thin volumes, go deep into the countryside, especially remote areas, and provide a large amount of spiritual food to farmers to meet their cultural needs. Chairman Mao said, "The serious problem is to educate the peasants." This work is worth paying attention to.

### 农民迫切需要适合于他们阅读的文艺创作

    农民迫切需要适合于他们阅读的文艺创作编辑同志：
    在旧社会里，乡间曾流行一种剧本，很多是用人民所习惯的形式写成的。如京剧、梆子等等，每本仅有三、两出戏，四、五页厚，售价只几个铜板。记得这些剧本，大都是北京一些私人书店出版的。曾受到当时粗通文字的广大农民的欢迎。但有许多剧本内容是色情的、反动的，给农民带来不少毒害。
    现在，乡间许多较大的集镇上，这样的书摊都没有了。书店里售卖的书大部分是厚本的，成本高，内容也不易为农民所接受。有的农民说：“要买本书也没处买。”有的人给城里的朋友写信，托他买旧小剧本。因为，事实上，一个农民是不可能为买一本小书去到城里跑一趟，托人代买又不一定为自己所喜爱。我建议出版部门对此引起严重注意，作家们多创作适合农民需要的作品，如农民所欢迎的小说、短剧、快板等，印成薄本，深入农村，特别是偏远的地方，大量供应农民精神食粮，满足农民的文化要求。毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”这项工作是值得重视的。
