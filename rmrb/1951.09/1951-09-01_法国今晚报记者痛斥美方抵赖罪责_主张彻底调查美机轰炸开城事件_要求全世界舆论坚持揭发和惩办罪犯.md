Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The French "Tonight" reporter Béquet reported from Kaesong on the 29th: To prevent further loss of life in Korea, a thorough investigation of the bombing of Kaesong last Wednesday is essential. If the United States continues to refuse to do so, countries with troops in Korea, and all those concerned with maintaining peace, must insist on a scientific investigation of the facts. But action must be taken quickly. Syngman Rhee's personnel have begun to threaten the local people, saying that "in a few days" when their troops arrive here, they will kill five thousand people. They are using these words to warn the local people not to speak. But in any case, a fair investigation will prove the following three points: (1) It is true that aircraft bombed and strafed Kaesong on Wednesday night. (2) The attack was deliberately aimed at General Nam Il's headquarters and was carried out by highly skilled pilots. (3) The attacking aircraft dropped US-made fragmentation bombs and napalm bombs.

The U.S. military officer Kenny, who conducted the investigation, either did not have the technical ability to investigate, or lied, or both. The people of Kaesong can testify that bombing and strafing occurred, and expert inspection can confirm this. The next question is: which side did the aircraft belong to? Obviously, it is difficult to identify which side the pilots and aircraft belong to. But the bombs fell 200 yards from Nam Il's headquarters and 150 yards from the press center. Who would believe that there were such skilled pilots who could drop bombs so accurately in the dark, that a difference of only one second meant that either Nam Il and other representatives of the delegation would have been killed, or the entire press corps would have been wiped out.

These are irrefutable facts, no matter how much everyone in the U.S. ruling group, from Kenny to Truman, denies it. A reasonable conjecture is this: the helicopters that carry Kenny and other senior U.S. Air Force officers to a place hundreds of yards from Nam Il's residence every day have conducted multiple surveys of the very complex terrain around the residence. Only six days before this incident, North Korea finally received a written guarantee from the United States that their air force would no longer violate Kaesong's airspace. In fact, violations of Kaesong's airspace have continued to occur to this day. Kenny's report, on the such serious matter of the bombing attack, is doing everything possible to deceive the world. Kenny's deceptive report is merely a development of the deceptive tactics used by the U.S. side to muzzle their public opinion from the first day of the meeting. This incident is of the same type as the incident they created more than a year ago to provoke war here. Just like last June, Truman and his ilk are again acting in a flustered manner based on the same crudely fabricated "evidence." The U.S. side today, just as it did a year ago, wants to prevent the Koreans from presenting the facts. The facts and evidence are here. The Americans are guilty and cannot deny it, and the photos and documents are the evidence. Worldwide public opinion must persist in exposing and punishing the criminals. The only way to do this is to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation of the bombing of Kaesong.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st: French Paris "Tonight" reporter Béquet reported from Kaesong on the 29th: A U.S. aircraft seriously violated the neutral zone of Kaesong again this morning. This aircraft circled over Kaesong twice at 2:40 a.m., dropping flares near the conference site. This incident occurred after the U.S. side guaranteed on August 16th that no more aircraft would fly over Kaesong. This is another attempt to intimidate the residents of Kaesong, another indication of the U.S.'s contempt for all agreements, and it occurred six hours before Ridgway sent a notice refusing to continue the investigation of the bombing incident on the evening of the 22nd.

If Ridgway really believes his own claim that the bombing of Kaesong was "fabricated out of thin air," he should accept the challenge and send experts and reporters to make the truth known to the world.

What U.S. Liaison Officer Kenny saw on the evening of the 22nd was enough for him to understand that an aircraft did drop U.S. bombs in Kaesong. The reason why he refused to conduct a full investigation on the spot, refused to come again the next day, and has not come since, is here. The reason why Ridgway now refuses to investigate is also here.

Now that Ridgway has refused to conduct an investigation, other United Nations member states with troops in Korea must demand that experts from all fields—experts who can distinguish the types of bombs from the tail and fragments of the bombs, experts who can distinguish the countries that manufactured these bombs from the paint and steel on the bombs, chemists who can distinguish the types of napalm bombs and the date they were dropped, experts who can distinguish the height at which they were dropped from the wrinkles in the steel—investigate whether grenade craters were mistaken for bomb craters, and determine whether the air raid was "fabricated out of thin air." It is terrible that the issue of war and peace depends on the verbal reports of officers like Kenny. Here are documents and photos that are enough to prove that Kenny is an untrustworthy witness.

Ridgway's excuse for refusing to investigate is that the investigation would only delay the armistice negotiations. The Korean-Chinese side has made it very clear that negotiations cannot proceed without a satisfactory answer regarding the bombing incident on the evening of the 22nd. Therefore, Ridgway should bear full responsibility for delaying the negotiations. The whole world remembers very well that Ridgway interrupted the negotiations because Joy saw a few soldiers with weapons. Although that incident was purely technical and the Korean-Chinese side apologized within hours of the protest, Ridgway delayed the negotiations for a week. No one can be fooled by his hypocritical tears for delaying the negotiations now. The incident on the evening of August 22nd was not a technical violation of the agreement, but a despicable, premeditated murder that was carefully planned and skillfully executed, an incident that nearly killed the representatives of the Korean-Chinese countries. There is no doubt that the U.S. side hoped that this would automatically end the armistice negotiations. But the Korean-Chinese side has been correct and sincere from the beginning. They said before that incident: no matter what happens, their side will not stop the negotiations without proper procedures and investigation. They have adhered to this point, despite the fact that the other side's provocative actions have reached a climax. They are still prepared to continue the negotiations after this incident is properly handled. Regardless of how the handling is done or how it is carried out, one thing is certain: the attack on the evening of the 22nd must be investigated.

    法国今晚报记者痛斥美方抵赖罪责
    主张彻底调查美机轰炸开城事件
    要求全世界舆论坚持揭发和惩办罪犯
   【新华社三十日讯】法国今晚报记者贝却敌二十九日自开城报道：为了以后在朝鲜不致再有人牺牲生命，彻底调查上星期三的轰炸开城事件是十分必要的。如果美国继续拒绝这样做，派有军队在朝鲜的国家，以及所有关心维持和平的人，就必须坚持对事实进行科学的调查。但是必须迅速采取行动。李承晚的人员已开始威吓当地老百姓说：“不几天”他们的军队一到这里，就要把五千人都杀掉。他们用这种话来警告当地老百姓不要开口。但无论如何，公正的调查将会证明以下三点：（一）的确有飞机在星期三夜间轰炸并扫射开城。（二）这次袭击是蓄意以南日将军总部为目标，并且是由技巧高明的驾驶员驾驶的。（三）来袭的飞机曾投掷美制杀伤弹和凝固汽油弹。
    进行调查的美方军官肯尼上校，不是没有在技术上调查的能力，就是撒谎，或者两者兼备。开城人民可以证明有轰炸和扫射的事发生，专家的检查也可以证实这一点。下一个问题是：飞机是那一方面的呢？显然，驾驶员和飞机属于那一方面是难于识别的。但是炸弹是落在距南日总部二百码、距记者招待所一百五十码的地方。谁会相信有这样高明的驾驶员能在漆黑的夜里把炸弹投得这样巧，只消一秒钟之差，不是把南日和代表团其他代表炸死，就是把整个记者团炸光。
    以上是无法辩驳的事实，无论美国统治集团中从肯尼起到杜鲁门止每一个人怎样抵赖也没有用。一种合乎情理的揣测是这样的：天天载送肯尼以及美方其他高级空军军官到距离南日寓所几百码地方的直升飞机，曾对寓所周围的非常复杂的地形进行过多次勘察。在这个事件发生前不过六天，北朝鲜终于接到美方的书面保证说，他们的空军不再侵犯开城领空。实际上，侵犯开城领空的事一直连续发生到现在。肯尼的报告，在关于这次轰炸袭击的如此严重的问题上，极尽欺骗世界的能事。肯尼的骗人的报告，只不过是美方从会议开始第一天起箝制他们的舆论的欺骗手法的发展而已。这个事件，是和他们在一年多以前为了在这里挑动战争而制造的事件，属于同一类型的。和去年六月一样，杜鲁门之流又那样手忙脚乱地根据同样粗制滥造的“证据”动作起来了。美方今天也和一年前一样，想阻止朝鲜人提出事实。事实和证据就在这里。美国人罪证确凿，无法抵赖，照片和文件就是证据。全世界舆论必须坚持揭发和惩办罪犯。要做到这一点，唯一的办法，是对轰炸开城事件立即进行彻底调查。
    【新华社三十一日讯】法国巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌二十九日自开城报道：美机一架今日清晨又严重地侵犯了开城的中立区。这架飞机于早晨二时四十分在开城上空盘旋两周，在会址附近投下照明弹。这次事件发生在美方于八月十六日保证不再有飞机飞过开城之后。这是又一次企图恫吓开城居民的行动，是美国蔑视一切协议的又一次表示，而且是发生在李奇微送出通知拒绝继续调查二十二日晚轰炸事件的六小时以前。
    如果李奇微真的相信他自己的说法，说那次轰炸开城的事件是“无中生有”，他就应该接受挑战，派专家和记者来把真象公诸全世界。
    美方联络官肯尼在二十二日晚上看到的东西，也够他明了确有一架飞机在开城投了美国炸弹。他所以拒绝就地进行充分调查，第二天所以拒绝再来，以后也再不来，原因就在这里。李奇微现在所以拒绝调查，原因也在这里。
    现在李奇微既已拒绝进行调查，有军队在朝鲜的其他联合国会员国必须要求各方面专家——能够从炸弹的弹尾和碎片辨别出炸弹的种类、从炸弹上的油漆和钢质辨别出制造这种炸弹的国家的专家，能够辨别出凝固汽油弹的种类和投掷的日期的化学家，能够从钢上的皱纹辨别出投掷的高度的专家——调查是不是手榴弹坑被误认为炸弹坑，判断这次空袭是不是“无中生有”。让和战问题系在肯尼这样的军官的口头报告上，真是十分可怕的事。这里有文件和照片，足以证明肯尼是信不得的证人。
    李奇微拒绝调查的藉口是认为调查只会使停战谈判拖延下去。朝中方面说得很明白，如果得不到关于二十二日晚轰炸事件的满意答复，谈判是不能进行的。因此李奇微应对拖延谈判负完全责任。全世界记得很清楚，李奇微曾因乔埃看见几个带有武器的士兵就使谈判中断了。虽然那次事件纯粹是技术性的，而且朝中方面在对方提出抗议数小时之内就道了歉，但是李奇微却把谈判拖了一个星期。他现在对于拖延谈判的假惺惺的眼泪是谁也骗不了的。八月二十二日夜晚的事件不是一个技术性的破坏协议的事件，而是经过精心策划、巧妙执行的一个卑鄙的蓄意谋杀的事件，这次事件使朝中两国代表险遭不测。毫无疑问，美方希望这样一来会使停战谈判自动结束。但是朝中方面自始就是正确和诚恳的。他们在那次事件发生之前就说过：无论发生什么事件，他们这一方不会不经过正当的手续和调查使谈判停顿。他们坚守这一点，尽管对方的挑衅行为已达到登峰造极的地步。他们仍然准备在这次事件经过正当的处置之后继续举行谈判。不论处置的办法怎样，执行得怎样，有一件事是肯定的，就是：必须调查二十二日晚的袭击事件。
