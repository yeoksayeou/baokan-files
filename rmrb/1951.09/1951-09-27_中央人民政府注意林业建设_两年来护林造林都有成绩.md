The forestry construction in New China over the past two years has achieved much in forest protection, afforestation, logging, and cultivation of forestry talents. In old China, forests were only destroyed. Forestry construction only began after the Chinese people gained state power. In the past two years, the most important aspect of forestry construction has been forest protection, which means fighting against the destruction and damage of forests.

Our country's forest area accounts for only about five percent of the land area. Resources are insufficient and demand is increasing. Afforestation is certainly a long-term plan and very important. However, protecting existing forests is even more urgent. In the past two years, although forest fires and indiscriminate logging have not been completely stopped, the number of fires has been greatly reduced compared to before liberation, and indiscriminate logging has also been largely curbed. Mass forest protection organizations have been established in all major forest areas across the country. As of now, more than 20,000 forest protection groups or forest protection committees have been established by the people in forest areas, with the East China and Northeast regions having the most. The Northeast forest area also has forest protection police.

In terms of afforestation, the national afforestation task for 1950 was 1.77 million mu, and the result was more than 2.85 million mu completed (the previously published 1.63 million mu was an incomplete statistic), not including the more than 300 million trees planted sporadically by the masses. This year, the planned afforestation area nationwide is 70 percent larger than last year, and more than 83 percent has already been completed. In addition, the area of nationwide hillside closure for forest cultivation in the past two years totaled more than 7.8 million mu, of which the East China region (mainly Shandong Province) alone accounted for more than 3 million mu, nearly half of the total area of hillside closure for forest cultivation nationwide.

In terms of logging, the state-owned forest logging operations in the past two years have been mainly in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia, and both regions have overfulfilled the state-stipulated logging plans for two years. Because a reasonable logging system has been established, the phenomenon of waste in logging has also stopped. The two regions can save more than 700,000 cubic meters of wood for the country each year in logging. In addition, the use of ice roads to transport wood in various forest areas, and the artificial breaking of ice before the river water thaws to advance the flow of wood, have also reduced the loss of wood.

Our country is very short of forestry talents. For long-term construction, the forestry departments of the central and local people's governments have paid great attention to the training of forestry cadres in the past two years. The Northeast now has more than 2,000 cadres engaged in forest survey and forest exploration work. The Northwest has many cadres and students who have conducted on-the-spot surveys of forest resources in the Qinling Mountains, Xiaolongshan Mountains, Tao River Basin, and Bailong River Basin. In Central South and East China, many university professors and students have participated in forestry work. In the past two years, more than 3,000 forestry cadres and more than 6,000 students newly engaged in forestry work have been trained nationwide. In addition, the forestry departments of various universities and forestry technical schools have also developed.

Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, it has paid close attention to forestry construction. The people of the whole country, especially the peasants, have also generally recognized the importance of forest construction for agriculture and industry, and for national production and construction. Therefore, great achievements have been made in forestry construction in the past two years. In the work of forest protection and afforestation, mass forest protection and mass cooperative afforestation have played a great role. Mass cooperative afforestation can strengthen the planning of afforestation and improve the survival rate of seedlings, and can promote mass forest protection work. The area of new forests planted by mass cooperation in East China this spring accounted for more than 80 percent of its total afforestation. Cooperative afforestation in Central South also accounted for more than half this year. Since Hebei Province promoted cooperative afforestation, more than 100,000 mu of sandy wasteland has been planted with windbreak forest belts and forest networks. In the logging work, the logging workers in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions felled trees close to the ground, fully demonstrating their enthusiasm for cherishing national property.

### 中央人民政府注意林业建设  两年来护林造林都有成绩

    中央人民政府注意林业建设
    两年来护林造林都有成绩
    新中国两年来的林业建设，在护林、造林、采伐和培养林业人材等各方面都有很多成绩。旧中国对森林只有破坏，林业建设只是从中国人民取得国家政权后才开始的。两年来林业建设中最重要的一项就是护林，就是向摧残森林和破坏森林的现象作斗争。
    我国森林面积只占国土面积百分之五左右，资源不足，需用日广，造林固然是百年大计，非常重要，但是，保护现有的森林就更是刻不容缓的事情。两年来，在护林工作方面，虽然森林火灾和滥伐林木的现象还未完全停止，但是火灾的次数已较解放以前大为减少，滥伐林木的现象也已大部分被制止。全国各主要林区都已建立有群众性的护林组织。截至目前，由林区人民成立的护林小组或护林委员会已有两万多个，以华东和东北两区为最多，东北林区并有护林警察。
    在造林工作方面，一九五零年全国的造林任务是一百七十七万亩，结果完成了二百八十五万多亩
    （前发表的一百六十三万亩是不完全的统计），群众零星栽植的三亿多株树还不在此内。今年全国计划造林的面积比去年大百分之七十，现在已经完成了百分之八十三以上。此外，两年来全国封山育林的面积共七百八十多万亩，其中仅华东区（主要是山东省）就有三百多万亩，几占全国封山育林总面积的一半。
    在采伐方面，两年来国营森林的采伐事业主要在东北和内蒙，这两区两年都超额完成了国家规定的采伐计划。因为建立了合理的采伐制度，采伐中的浪费现象也停止了，两区每年在采伐上就可为国家节省七十多万立方公尺木材。此外，各林区利用冰道运材，和在河水解冻以前，用人工刨开冰块，提前流送，也减低了木材的耗损。
    我国林业人材很缺，为了长期建设，两年来中央和各地人民政府的林业部门，都很注意培养林业干部。东北现在已有两千多干部，在从事林野调查和森林勘测工作。西北已有很多干部和学生实地调查了秦岭、小陇山、洮河流域和白龙江流域的森林资源。中南和华东方面，都有很多大学教授和学生参加了林业工作。两年来全国训练了三千多名林业在职干部，六千多新参加林业工作的学生。此外，各大学的森林系和林业专科学校也有发展。
    中央人民政府一成立就很注意林业建设，全国人民特别是农民也普遍认识了森林建设对于农业和工业，对于国家生产建设的重要性。因此，两年林业建设才取得了很大的成就。在护林和造林的工作上，群众护林和群众合作造林起了很大的作用。群众合作造林可以加强造林的计划性和提高树苗的成活率，并可推进群众性的护林工作。华东区今春由群众合作所造的新林面积，即占其造林总数的百分之八十以上。中南区今年合作造林也占一半以上。河北省推广合作造林以来，已有十多万亩沙荒地植造了防风沙的林带和林网。在采伐工作上，东北和内蒙两区的伐木职工，有的贴地伐木，充分发挥了爱护国家资财的热情。（新华社）
