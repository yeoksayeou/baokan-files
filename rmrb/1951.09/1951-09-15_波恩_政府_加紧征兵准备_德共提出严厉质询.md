Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 14th: The West German Bonn "government" is recently intensifying its preparations for conscription, which has aroused strong opposition from the West German people. According to West German newspapers, Rohl, the Interior Minister of the Bonn "government," requested the Bonn "Parliament" Finance Committee last month to pay a sum of money for the purpose of "compiling a list of draftees." The Bonn "government's" conscription plan is to forcibly conscript all West German youths born between 1931 and 1934 (18 to 21 years old) into military service in mid-1952, in order to initially establish a mercenary army of 12 divisions of 250,000 men.

Regarding this conspiracy of the Bonn "government," the German Communist Party faction in the Bonn "Parliament" has raised stern questions, demanding that the Bonn "government" provide a public response. The questions raised are as follows:

    (1) Is the compilation of this list based on the task given by the Federal Chancellor and with his consent?

    (2) Which agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior is responsible for compiling this list?

    (3) Is the compilation of this list based on the orders of the Allied High Commissioners and with their consent?

    (4) What are the considerations for the Federal Chancellor's failure to submit this measure, caused by the re-militarization, to the Federal Parliament for approval? Why has the Federal Chancellor not informed the Federal Parliament of the secret compilation of this list until now?

    波恩“政府”加紧征兵准备
    德共提出严厉质询
    【新华社十四日讯】柏林消息：西德波恩“政府”最近正在加紧进行征兵的准备工作，此事已引起西德人民的强烈反对。据西德报纸透露：波恩“政府”内政部长勒尔上月曾向波恩“议会”财政委员会请求支付一笔经费，作为“编制壮丁名单”之用。波恩“政府”的征兵计划是在一九五二年中强迫征募所有一九三一至一九三四年出生（十八岁至二十一岁）的西德青年服兵役，以便初步建立起拟议中的十二个师二十五万人的雇佣军来。
    对于波恩“政府”这一阴谋，在波恩“议会”中的德国共产党党团已提出严厉的质询，要求波恩“政府”公开答复。质询中提出的问题如下：
    （一）编制这个名单是不是根据联邦总理所给予的任务和得到他的同意的？
    （二）联邦内政部的什么机构负责编制这个名单？
    （三）编制这个名单是不是根据盟国高级专员公署的命令和得到它的同意的？
    （四）联邦总理到现在为止还没有把这个因为重新军国主义化而引起的措施提交联邦议会批准，这是出于什么考虑？为什么直到现在联邦总理还不让联邦议会知道秘密编制这个名单的这件事情？
