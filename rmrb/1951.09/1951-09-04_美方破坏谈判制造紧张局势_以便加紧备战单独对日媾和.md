Xinhua News Agency, London, September 2nd: TASS reported from London on September 2nd: News reports clearly show that the American ruling clique is trying to disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations by various means and has adopted provocative methods such as bombing the Kaesong neutral zone.

The American ruling clique believes that it is now necessary to maintain a state of tension in order to intimidate public opinion and rush Congress (which will adjourn in September) to pass huge military budgets and tax increase bills, as well as the $8.5 billion "foreign aid" bill. In this regard, the British newspaper "Sunday Times" stated that a ceasefire would greatly affect people's minds, and said that some people are worried that Congress might reduce "defense" spending due to calming down. "New York Times" reporter Reston emphasized that officials fear a ceasefire in Korea mainly because it may relax the implementation of the rearmament plan in the United States and the Atlantic Alliance countries. Many American newspapers have indicated that the American ruling clique is worried that due to the end of hostilities in Korea, the domestic desire for peace in the United States may rise, and war hysteria may weaken.

The press pointed out that the American ruling clique is trying to break the Kaesong negotiations in order to increase tensions in the Far East, thereby forcing Britain, France, and other countries to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan. The purpose of this treaty is to rearm Japan and make it a US military base in the Far East.

    美方破坏谈判制造紧张局势
    以便加紧备战单独对日媾和
     【新华社三日讯】塔斯社伦敦二日讯：从报上消息可以清楚地看出，美国统治集团企图用各种办法使朝鲜停战谈判破裂，并且采取了像轰炸开城中立区和其他的挑衅方法。
    美国统治集团认为，现在必须保持紧张状态，以便恫吓舆论并使国会（国会将于九月间休会）匆匆通过庞大军事预算和增税法案，以及八十五亿美元的“援外”法案。关于这一点，英国报纸“星期日泰晤士报”说，停火将大大地影响人心，并说，有人担心国会可能因平静下来而减少“防务”支出。“纽约时报”记者莱斯顿强调说，官员们害怕朝鲜境内的停火，主要是因为这可能使整军计划的推行在美国和大西洋集团国家松弛下来。许多美国报纸表示：美国统治集团担心，由于朝鲜敌对行为的结束，美国国内希望和平的愿望可能高涨，而战争歇斯底里可能减弱。
    报界人士指出，美国统治集团力图破裂开城谈判，俾能增加远东的紧张状态，从而迫使英国、法国及其他国家签订单独对日和约。这个和约的目的是重新武装日本，使它成为美国在远东的军事基地。
