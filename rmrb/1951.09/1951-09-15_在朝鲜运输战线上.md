    On the Transportation Front in Korea

    Through the heavy snows of the Korean winter and the continuous rains of summer, day and night, the Chinese Railway Volunteer Aid Korea Brigade, together with the volunteer railway technical forces and Korean railway workers, fought bravely against enemy aircraft, completing arduous transportation tasks.

    The American aggressors, attempting to sever the transport and supply lines of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers through frenzied bombing, used tons of bombs day and night, indiscriminately bombing stations, bridges, lines, and vehicles on the Korean railway lines. But the transport and supply lines could not be cut. A certain locomotive was riddled with over three hundred holes by enemy aircraft. The face towel of driver and model worker Wang Jikui, which was hanging on the locomotive, had eight bullet holes in it, and even the stoker's coal shovel was broken. How did they face such danger? Wang Jikui said, "I would rather sacrifice myself than let the supplies for aiding Korea be destroyed by the American bandits!" His words represent the will of every railway soldier. It was this spirit of love for the motherland and the Korean people that supported them in overcoming all kinds of difficulties and ensuring that railway transport was not cut off.

    Repairing bridges is the top priority for our brave warriors.

    The conditions were difficult, and materials were lacking. Those who knew how to blacksmith borrowed blacksmith's furnaces from nearby Korean residents and searched for large quantities of scrap iron in the mines to make their own saws, spikes... On frozen rivers, the soldiers used picks to break open the ice layer and then plunged into the piercingly cold water to build trestles...

    This is one of the heroic deeds of the soldiers overcoming difficulties to repair bridges. When labor model Jiang Fayu and others were repairing a certain bridge, because the task was urgent, they worked on the site during the day in addition to working at night. One morning, when they were tying up a winch on top of a trestle, enemy aircraft suddenly appeared and strafed. At that time, two sets of braces were just tied, and they would fall apart if released. Jiang Fayu immediately told the others to take cover. He leaned against the crossbeam and held the large rope of the trestle tightly with both hands. The explosion of the bombs shook him violently, but he refused to let go. He persevered until the plane left, finally securing the trestle. The bridge was thus quickly repaired.

    Bridges cannot be destroyed completely; the soldiers repair them as soon as they are bombed. Whenever enemy aircraft bombed, soldier Cai You would repair the bridge. A certain river bridge was destroyed many times, but each time it was quickly repaired by the brave warriors. The warriors said, "Our bridges can never be completely destroyed!" The engineering team led by labor model Cao Guowang once completed the repair of thirteen bridges in a hundred and eighteen kilometers in a very short time. Many soldiers persisted in working day and night, enabling the bridges to open to traffic ahead of schedule. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, many bridges have been hit by an average of one or two bombs every day, but on top of the layers of large and small bomb craters, there still stand indestructible bridges, allowing trains loaded with supplies to continuously travel to the front.

    Over the past ten months, difficult and arduous conditions have made the heroes even stronger. When repairing a bridge, a certain engineering squad created a record of each person completing 24.9 cubic meters of earthwork per day, which was nearly five times higher than the upper-level regulations.

    In a moving letter to his wife, a volunteer engineer who went to Korea said, "...When I see these real heroes with their tired, bloodshot eyes, I am moved beyond words by these noble people who are striving for the happiness of mankind. I am determined to stick with them to the last moment." (Xinhua News Agency)

    在朝鲜运输战线上
    在朝鲜大雪纷飞的寒冬和霪雨连绵的夏天，在白日，在黑夜，中国铁路志愿援朝大队与志愿军铁道技术部队的战士们，和朝鲜铁路职工一起，日日夜夜地坚韧地与敌机相搏斗，完成了繁重的运输任务。
    美国侵略者妄想以疯狂的轰炸来切断朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的运输补给线，日日夜夜，空中强盗以成吨的炸弹，滥炸朝鲜铁道线上的车站、桥梁、线路、车辆，但是运输补给线是切不断的。某机车被敌机炸了三百多个窟窿，司机长劳动模范王吉魁的一条洗脸手巾挂在机车上，被机关枪打了八个枪眼，甚至司炉的煤铲都被打断了。可是他们怎样对待这样的危险呢？王吉魁说：“我宁肯牺牲自己，也不能让援朝的物资被美国强盗毁掉！”他的话代表着每一个铁路战士的意志。就是这种热爱祖国和朝鲜人民的精神，支持着他们克服了各种困难，保证铁路运输不被切断。
    抢修桥梁是我们勇士们头等的任务。
    条件是困难的，缺少材料，会打铁的人从附近朝鲜居民那里借来了铁匠炉，到矿山上去搜来大批废铁，自己赶造釟锯、道钉……。在结冰的江河上，战士们用镐砸开冰层，然后钻进刺骨寒冷的江水中去架设木马……。
    这是战士们克服困难抢修桥梁的英勇事迹之一。劳动模范姜发玉等在抢修某桥时，因为任务很急，除了夜间干活外，白天也上现场。有一天上午，当他们正在排架顶上绑卷扬机时，敌机突然临空扫射。当时有两付刚绑上，一放手就要散掉。姜发玉立刻叫其他的人去隐避，自己靠在横木上面，两手紧紧握住排架的大绳。炸弹的爆炸把他震得直愰，但是他死也不松手，他一直坚持到飞机走了，终于把排架绑牢。桥因此很快修复。
    桥是炸不断的，战士们随炸随修复。战士蔡有每当敌机轰炸一过，他就在桥上进行抢修了。某江桥被炸毁许多次，但是每一次都被勇士们迅速修复了。勇士们说：“我们的桥是永远炸不断的！”劳动模范曹国望所领导的工程队，有一次在极短时间内完成了一百十八公里中的十三座桥梁的抢修任务。许多战士日夜地坚持工作，使桥梁提前通车。从朝鲜战争爆发到现在，许多桥梁平均每天落一两个炸弹，但是在那重重叠叠大大小小的炸弹坑上面，仍然屹立着一座座不屈的桥梁，让满载物资的列车源源驶向前方。
    十个月来，艰难和困苦的环境，把英雄们锻炼得更坚强了。某工程小队在修桥时，创造每人每天做土方二十四．九立方的最高纪录，超过上级规定将近五倍。
    一个志愿赴朝的工程师给他爱人写的信中，非常动人地说：“……我一看到这些疲累的眼睛都充血的真正的好汉们，我就被这些崇高的为人类的幸福而奋斗的人们感动得说不出话，我决心和他们坚持到最后一刻。”（新华社）
