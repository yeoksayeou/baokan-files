    Emphasize and Strengthen Workers' Political Education

    Conducting systematic political education for the working masses, raising their class consciousness, and enabling them to recognize the position of the working class in state power today and its role in national construction, is one of the most important tasks of the Party and trade unions in various regions.

    Currently, there is a serious deficiency in worker's political education: a lack of regular, systematic education in the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, in some factories and mines, leading cadres in Party organizations, administrations, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League still exhibit a tendency to neglect political education, relax the Party's political work among the working masses, and disconnect practical work from political education. Furthermore, since the State Council issued instructions to strengthen the cultural education of workers and staff a year ago, some localities have failed to appropriately combine cultural education and political education in their leadership, even opposing them. As a result, worker's political education has shown a slackening trend in various places, resulting in a considerable number of workers still not fully understanding and embodying the social status of the working class today and the leadership power of the working class; their understanding of class is still vague, and they also lack a correct understanding of the relationship between the working class and the Communist Party.

    How should worker's political education be strengthened? We believe that the plan made by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC is basically correct and appropriate. At present, it is necessary to focus on educating workers about communism and the Communist Party to strengthen the working masses' correct understanding of the Party and the working class and to raise their class consciousness. Based on the preliminary experience of carrying out worker's political education in various places, the content of political education must be closely integrated with the actual lives of the working masses. Party committees and trade unions at all levels must adopt various methods to strengthen leadership and carry out political education for the working masses.

### 重视和加强工人政治教育

    重视和加强工人政治教育
    向工人群众进行系统的政治教育，提高工人群众的阶级觉悟，使工人群众认识到今天工人阶级在国家政权中所处的地位及其在国家建设工作中的作用，是目前各地党和工会的最主要的任务之一。
    目前在工人政治教育中，存在着一个严重的缺陷，就是对工人还缺乏经常的系统的马克思、列宁主义——毛泽东思想的基本教育。同时，在某些工厂矿山中，在党的组织和行政、工会、青年团的领导干部中，还存在着忽视政治教育、放松党在工人群众中的政治工作，以及实际工作与政治教育脱节的偏向。加以这一年来，自政务院颁布了加强职工文化教育的指示之后，有些地方在领导上没有能够把对于工人的文化教育与政治教育适当地结合起来，甚至把文化教育和政治教育对立起来。因此各地的工人政治教育便表现了一种松懈现象，致使相当数量的工人还不能完全了解和体现工人阶级今天所处的社会地位和工人阶级的领导力量；他们对于阶级的认识还是模糊的，同时对工人阶级与共产党的关系也还缺乏正确的认识。
    应如何加强工人的政治教育呢？我们认为中共河北省委所做的计划，基本上是正确和适当的。当前必须着重向工人进行共产主义与共产党的教育，这样才能加强工人群众对党和工人阶级的正确认识，提高他们的阶级觉悟。根据各地进行工人政治教育的初步经验，政治教育内容必须与工人群众的实际生活密切结合。各地党委和工会必须采用各种方法，加强领导与进行对工人群众的政治教育。
