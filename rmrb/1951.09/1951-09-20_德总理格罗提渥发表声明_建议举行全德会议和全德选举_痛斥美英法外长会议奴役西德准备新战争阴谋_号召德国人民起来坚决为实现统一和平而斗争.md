Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 16th: According to TASS, the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, made a statement in the People's Chamber on September 15th regarding the resolutions on the German question made at the Washington meeting of the US, British, and French foreign ministers. He suggested that the People's Chamber issue an appeal to the Bonn Federal Council to hold an all-German conference with representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to discuss: (1) the issue of holding free all-German elections to establish a German National Assembly; (2) the issue of accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Grotewohl's statement emphasized that the imperialists' preparations for launching a new world war have entered a decisive stage. At the foreign ministers' meeting in Washington, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France reached an agreement on three conditions for re-militarizing West Germany and including it in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These are: First, the United States, Britain, and France will retain the right to station armed forces in West Germany after the end of the occupation "to protect the Federal Republic"; second, the German army will participate in the "security system of the Atlantic Alliance countries"; and third, the Adenauer "government" will be granted "equal rights" in international affairs and "autonomy" in internal affairs, but the United States, Britain, and France will retain the right to interfere in West German affairs under the pretext of maintaining West German "security." Grotewohl analyzed and denounced these three resolutions. He pointed out that the so-called "defensive forces" to be stationed in West Germany to maintain West German security are a shameless deception of the German people. Hitler used exactly the same words when he began his offensive against the world. Making the German army participate in the North Atlantic Group means placing them in the position of colonial troops, using German youth as weapons in the hands of foreigners, and inciting the German people to kill each other. Without national unity, without concluding a peace treaty, and without the withdrawal of the occupying forces, it is impossible to restore Germany's complete sovereignty and freedom in foreign policy and foreign trade. He pointed out that the German people do not need "equal rights" to participate in preparations for a new war and to sacrifice on the battlefield; they only need equal rights with other nations so that they can develop peacefully in political, economic, and cultural aspects.

Grotewohl pointed out that the final stage of restoring German militarism and preparing for a new world war in Europe will come immediately after this Washington conference. Therefore, he called on the German people to mobilize and fight against this danger. He pointed out: "The war camp understands very well that without the German people, war plans in Europe cannot be realized. Therefore, the German people currently bear a decisive responsibility, and this responsibility cannot be evaded by any German."

Grotewohl reviewed the efforts made by the German Democratic Republic since its establishment to maintain Germany's peace and unity, and especially pointed out that the People's Chamber's proposal to the West German Federal Council on January 30th this year regarding the establishment of an all-German constitutional assembly is in line with the national interests of the German people. However, for several months, facts have proven that Adenauer does not want to reach an agreement between the people of East and West Germany, because this would prevent the re-militarization of West Germany. During this period, he has greatly restored West Germany's war potential, and preparations for restoring the German Wehrmacht are underway. Due to the signing of the Schuman Plan, the coal of the Ruhr and West Germany's heavy industry will be placed under the control of American war merchants. Grotewohl emphasized that the Bonn "government's" policy of re-militarizing West Germany will lead to the destruction of West German residents.

Referring to the San Francisco conference, Grotewohl pointed out that the recently concluded separate peace treaty with Japan is a warning to all peace-loving people. What was concluded with Japan was not a peace treaty, but a war treaty. He especially warned that the same situation could happen in a different guise to Germany in Washington. The Washington Conference communiqué has shown how sinister the plans are for further enslaving the peace-loving people of West Germany. He said: The Washington Conference retained in a very definite form the "special rights" of the United States, Britain, and France on the issues of Berlin and Germany (including the conclusion of a peace treaty and the unification of Germany). This is simply an indefinite extension of the effectiveness of the occupation regulations, and its only goal is to further hinder the unification of Germany and refuse to conclude a peace treaty with Germany until Germany is dragged into a new war.

Grotewohl said: The proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to convene an all-German constitutional assembly has been rejected by the Bonn government and the West German Federal Council, who believe that it is impossible to convene a conference on an equal footing because the population of the Federal Republic accounts for two-thirds of the total German population. Regarding this, Grotewohl said: The question is not which side will get the majority of votes, but only that an agreement is reached between the people of East and West Germany. Therefore, the number of people participating in the negotiations is not decisive for such a conference.

Grotewohl called on the political, mass, and social organizations of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to resolutely support the People's Chamber's call for convening an all-German conference in order to realize the demand for all-German elections for unity and peace. He asked all good people in East and West Germany to fight for mutual understanding and to save the German nation.

Grotewohl's speech was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause, and he received enthusiastic cheers from the entire audience at the end of his speech.

### 德总理格罗提渥发表声明  建议举行全德会议和全德选举  痛斥美英法外长会议奴役西德准备新战争阴谋  号召德国人民起来坚决为实现统一和平而斗争

    德总理格罗提渥发表声明
    建议举行全德会议和全德选举
    痛斥美英法外长会议奴役西德准备新战争阴谋
    号召德国人民起来坚决为实现统一和平而斗争
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林十六日讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥于九月十五日在人民议会中就华盛顿美、英、法三国外长会议关于德国问题的决议发表声明，建议人民议会向波恩联邦议会发出呼吁，举行有德意志民主共和国和西德代表参加的全德会议，讨论：（一）关于举行全德自由选举以成立德国国民议会的问题；（二）关于加速缔结对德和约的问题。
    格罗提渥的声明着重指出，帝国主义者为发动新的世界大战而进行的准备工作已进入决定性的阶段。在华盛顿的外长会议上，美、英、法三国政府已经在使西德重新军国主义化及把西德列入北大西洋公约的三个条件上得到了协议。这就是：一、美、英、法三国将保有权利，在终止占领以后，在西德留驻武装部队“以保护联邦共和国”；二、德国军队将参加到“大西洋联盟各国安全体系中”；三、阿登纳“政府”将得到在国际问题上的“平等权利”和内政上的“自主权”，但是美英法三国保有权利，在维护西德“安全”的借口下，干涉西德的事务。格罗提渥对这三点决议作了分析并加以痛斥。他指出：所谓要在西德留驻“防御部队”以维护西德的安全，是对德国人民的厚颜无耻的欺骗，当希特勒开始对全世界进攻时，他恰恰也用的是这样的词句。使德国军队参加北大西洋集团，就是把他们置于殖民军队的地位，作为外国人手中的武器，利用德国青年为新战争服务，发动德国人民自相残杀。如果没有国家的统一、不缔结和约、占领军不撤退，要恢复德国的完全主权和德国在外交政策上及对外贸易上的自由，是不可能的。他指出：德国人民不需要有参加新战争的准备工作和到战场上去牺牲的“平等权利”，他们只需要有和其他民族平等的权利，以便在政治、经济和文化等方面可以和平地发展。
    格罗提渥指出：紧接在这次华盛顿会议以后，恢复德国军国主义和在欧洲准备新的世界大战的最后的阶段就会来到。因此，他号召德国人民动员起来，对这种危险进行斗争。他指出：“战争阵营很了解，没有德国人民，在欧洲的战争计划就不可能实现，因此，德国人民目前就负有决定性的责任，而且这种责任是任何一个德国人都逃避不了的。”
    格罗提渥回溯德意志民主共和国自成立以来为了维护德国的和平与统一而作的努力，并特别指出：人民议会今年一月三十日向西德联邦议会所发出的关于成立全德立宪议会的建议是符合于德国人民的民族利益的。但是，几个月以来，事实已经证明，阿登纳不希望在东西德人民之间达成协议，因为这将阻止西德重新军国主义化。在这一期间，他已经使西德战争潜力大大地恢复起来，恢复德国国防军的准备工作也正在进行；由于签订了舒曼计划，鲁尔的煤及西德的重工业将置于美国战争贩子的支配之下。格罗提渥强调指出：波恩“政府”使西德重新军国主义化的政策将使西德居民遭到毁灭。
    格罗提渥在谈到旧金山会议时指出，最近缔结的单独对日和约对于全体爱好和平的人民是一个警告。与日本所缔结的不是和平条约，而是战争条约。他特别提出警告说：同样的情形也会变个花样在华盛顿对德国发生。华盛顿会议公报已经表明：为了进一步奴役爱好和平的西德人民而制定的计划是何等阴险。他说：华盛顿会议以十分确定的形式保留了美、英、法三国在关于柏林问题和德国问题（包括缔结和约和统一德国的问题）上的一些“特别权利”，这只不过是把占领法规的效力无限期地延长罢了，它的唯一的目标就是进一步阻碍德国的统一，拒绝缔结对德和约，直到把德国拖入新战争为止。
    格罗提渥说：德意志民主共和国人民议会关于召开全德立宪议会的建议遭到了波恩政府与西德联邦议会的拒绝，他们认为：不可能在平等的基础上召开会议，因为联邦共和国的人口占全德人口的三分之二。对于这一点，格罗提渥表示：问题不在于哪
    一方将得到多数票，问题只在于德国东部与西部人民之间达成协议，因此，参加谈判的人数对这种会议没有决定性的意义。
    格罗提渥号召德意志民主共和国与西德的各政治的、群众的与社会的组织坚决支持人民议会关于召开全德会议的呼吁，以便实现为统一与和平而举行全德选举的要求。他要求东西德国一切善良的人们，为达成互相谅解和拯救德国民族而奋斗。
    格罗提渥的演说屡次被暴风雨般的掌声所打断，演说结束时受到全场热烈的欢呼。
