Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: A part of the Northern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group of the Central People's Government visited Wangjiayu and Zhuanbi villages in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, in late August, where the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai had lived.

The farmers of Wangjiayu Village carefully preserved the items used by the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, the houses where Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai lived, and the basketball used by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. When Deputy Head of the Visiting Group Yang Xiufeng led the visiting group to the village, the farmers gathered in front of the house where Commander-in-Chief Zhu De lived and told the visiting group about the situation when the commander-in-chief lived there. Zhang Xishi, a 73-year-old farmer, said, "Commander-in-Chief Zhu De got up before dawn, he was really busy with his work. He loved children the most. During the New Year, when the children paid him New Year's greetings, he would give them lucky money."

When the farmers of Zhuanbi Village talked about the heroic Chief of Staff Zuo Quan, who had sacrificed his life, some people shed tears. Zhuanbi Village is located on a high mountain top, and there is no well in the village. When the Eighth Route Army Headquarters was stationed here, it dug five wells, which solved the problem of drinking water for the villagers. As soon as the farmers drank the water from these wells, they affectionately remembered the benefactors who dug the wells.

After the labor force of Wangjiayu Village was organized, eighty to ninety surplus laborers in the whole village went to work in factories. Looking at today's happy situation, the farmers missed Commander-in-Chief Zhu De even more. They repeatedly asked Deputy Head of the Visiting Group Yang Xiufeng to tell Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De: "We are determined to support the front line with all our strength and follow you forever."

    北方老根据地访问团一部
    访问朱总司令住过的王家峪村
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府北方老根据地访问团一部，在上月下旬访问了八路军总部和朱总司令、彭德怀副总司令曾住过的山西省武乡县王家峪、砖壁两村。
    王家峪村的农民细心地保存着八路军总部用过的物品，朱总司令、彭副总司令住过的房子和朱总司令打篮球用过的篮球。当杨秀峰副团长率领访问团到该村时，农民们纷纷集合到朱总司令住过的房子前面，向访问团人员叙述当年总司令住在这里时的情形。七十三岁的农民张习诗说：“朱总司令不等天明就起来了，他的工作真忙。他最爱小孩子，过年时孩子们给他拜年，他还要给压岁钱。”
    砖壁村的农民们谈起英勇牺牲了的左权参谋长时，有些人掉下了眼泪。砖壁村是在一个高山顶上，村里没有水井。八路军总部驻在这里时，曾打了五口井，给该村农民解决了吃水的困难。农民们一吃到这井里的水，就亲切地记起挖井的恩人。
    王家峪村的劳动力组织起来以后，全村有八、九十个剩余劳动力都到工厂里去工作。农民们看着今天的幸福光景，更加怀念朱总司令。他们再三托杨秀峰副团长告诉毛主席、朱总司令：“我们决以一切力量支援前线，永远跟随你们走。”
