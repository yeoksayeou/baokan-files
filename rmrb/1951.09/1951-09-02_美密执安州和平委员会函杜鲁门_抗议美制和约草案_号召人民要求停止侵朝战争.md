Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 1st: According to the New York "Daily Worker," the Michigan Peace Committee in the United States sent a letter to Truman protesting the U.S.-drafted peace treaty with Japan. The letter stated that the peace treaty proposed by the United States is not and cannot be "acceptable to the many countries that have suffered from the militarist aggression and plunder of Japanese imperialism."

The letter pointed out that the peace treaty proposed by the United States cannot guarantee peace because it does not prohibit the rearmament and militarization of this country that recently attempted to conquer the world; because it allows the United States to continue to occupy Japan, giving the United States superior military advantages for future (unnecessary) wars; because it fails to return Taiwan to China, ignores the territorial settlement stipulated in Casablanca, and permits the United States to occupy Pacific islands.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 1st: The New York "Daily Worker" reported on August 28th that the Michigan Peace Committee in the United States launched a chain letter campaign last week demanding that Truman immediately stop the Korean War. The Peace Committee called on every Michigan resident to write a letter to Truman, and to write the same letter to five friends, and to ask each of them to do the same. Continuing in this way, an initiator can reach hundreds of thousands of people with such letters in a very short period of time.

The chain letter said: "The number of American casualties in Korea continues to increase, and now exceeds 80,000. Millions of Korean men, women and children have sacrificed or are sacrificing themselves. While the American delegation is looking for excuses to undermine the armistice negotiations, American casualties continue to increase. I urge you to ask President Truman to stop this senseless slaughter. Let us have a ceasefire, withdraw from the 38th parallel, and then withdraw completely from Korea. Our country is the United States, not Korea."

    美密执安州和平委员会函杜鲁门
    抗议美制和约草案
    号召人民要求停止侵朝战争
   【新华社布拉格一日电】据纽约“工人日报”报道：美国密执安州和平委员会致函杜鲁门，抗议美制对日和约草案。信中说：美国所建议的对日和约不是也不可能是“许多遭受日本帝国主义的军国主义侵略及掠夺的国家所能接受的”。
    信中指出：美国所建议的和约草案不能保证和平，因为它并未禁止最近以前还曾企图征服世界的这个国家重新武装和军国主义化；因为它允许美国继续占领日本，给美国以优越的军事有利条件以便将来进行（不需要的）战争；因为它未能把台湾归还中国，忽视在卡萨布兰卡规定的领土处理办法，并且准许美国占领太平洋各岛屿。
   【新华社布拉格一日电】纽约“工人日报”八月二十八日报道：美国密执安州和平委员会上周发起写连锁信的运动，要求杜鲁门马上停止朝鲜战争。和平委员会号召每一个密执安州人写信给杜鲁门，并写同样的信给五个朋友而且要求他们每人也都这样做。这样不断连续下去，一个发起人就可以在很短时期内使几十万人收到这样的信。
    这封连锁信里面说：“美军在朝鲜的伤亡人数不断增加，现在已超过八万人了。几百万朝鲜男女及儿童已经牺牲或正在牺牲。在美国代表团为破坏休战谈判寻找藉口的同时，美军伤亡人数在继续增加。我请你要求杜鲁门总统停止这个无谓的屠杀。让我们停火，从三八线撤退，然后再完全撤出朝鲜吧。我们的国家是美国，不是朝鲜。”
