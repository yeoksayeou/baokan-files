The National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union held its third plenary session from August 27th to September 2nd, discussing and determining the organization's future work guidelines.

The meeting included a work report for the first half of the year by Liu Zijiu, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Union. He pointed out that in the past six months, under the leadership and assistance of the local Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party, local people's governments, and local trade union federations, educational union organizations in various regions have organized teachers and students to go deep into factories, streets, neighborhoods, courtyards, and rural areas, extensively carrying out patriotic propaganda and education on resisting America and aiding Korea. Educational workers across the country responded to the "June 1st" call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, enthusiastically donating planes and cannons, with pledged donations reaching 24 billion yuan. The number of educational union members nationwide has grown to nearly 490,000, and educational union organizations have been established in 69 provincial-level cities across the country. After clarifying the orientation towards teaching, trade union organizations at all levels vigorously organized and led teachers in political, professional, and cultural studies. Many regions have established teaching and research correspondence networks, professional tutoring classes, cultural spare-time schools, spare-time colleges, night universities, spare-time correspondence normal schools, and other spare-time continuing education organizations for teachers. In many regions, administrative organs have accepted the recommendations of the trade unions and appropriately improved the living conditions of teachers. Teachers in the Northeast region received two pay raises this year, with teachers' salaries generally increasing by about 40%. In the North China region, teachers in each province received an average wage increase equivalent to 30 kilograms of millet per month. To enable female teachers to concentrate on teaching, educational unions across the country have established 127 nurseries with breastfeeding facilities in the past six months, caring for 1,503 children. In addition, cooperatives, mutual aid societies, and group personal insurance promoted by trade unions in various regions have also helped teachers solve some of their living difficulties. After highlighting the above achievements, Liu Zijiu provided specific suggestions for future work. The meeting discussed his report, and participants agreed that future work should be improved on the existing basis, continuing to deepen the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, specifically formulate and thoroughly inspect patriotic covenants, and do a good job in the donation campaign. At the same time, systematic political education should be conducted for educational workers; existing achievements in professional learning and welfare work should be consolidated; and experiences in these areas should be summarized and promoted. Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union, gave instructions at the meeting on how to regularize the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea and how to strengthen patriotic and internationalist education for educational workers.
