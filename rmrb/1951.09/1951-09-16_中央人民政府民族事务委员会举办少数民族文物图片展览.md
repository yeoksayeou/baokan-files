The Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Pictures of Ethnic Minorities, sponsored by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, opened on the 10th of this month at the Hall of Central Harmony and Hall of Preserving Harmony in the Forbidden City. The exhibits include cultural relics, pictures, and models. The exhibited cultural relics include banners, handicrafts, daily necessities, production tools, local products, writings, musical instruments, weapons, embroidery, and clothing. There is a flintlock rifle presented by the Panchen Erdeni to Chairman Mao, which was used by the Tibetan people fifty years ago to resist British imperialist aggression, and a medium-sized Mongolian yurt sent by the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The pictures record the development of ethnic affairs and the living conditions of the various ethnic groups since the founding of the People's Republic of China, including the visits of the Central Ethnic Visiting Delegations, the visits of delegations from various ethnic groups to Beijing, the political construction of ethnic minorities, cadre training, the signing of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and colorful photographs of the lives of the Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, Yi, and Zhong ethnic groups, as well as the yet-to-be-liberated Gaoshan ethnic group. The exhibition also displays life models of the Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, and Yi ethnic groups, and broadcasts music and songs of various ethnic groups at regular intervals, vividly depicting the thriving lives of various ethnic minorities since liberation, fully demonstrating the correctness and greatness of Chairman Mao and the ethnic policies of the Central People's Government.
    The exhibition is scheduled to close on October 20th.
