    A Brief Review of Economic Life
    New Factories Should Not Be Blindly Constructed
    Local industries in various regions are vigorously developing. In this work, attention should be paid to avoiding blindness in production and capital construction, as well as tendencies toward localism.
    Shanxi Egg Industry Co., Ltd. (under the leadership of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Industry Department) was established in the spring of 1950, with a total of four egg factories at that time. The Shanxi Provincial Industry Department did not understand the national egg product production and sales situation, and only felt that the egg product production in 1949 was very profitable, so they wanted to open two more factories. In March 1950, the China Egg Product Company, based on the national egg product production and sales situation, suggested that the province should not set up new factories. However, the Shanxi Provincial Industry Department rejected this suggestion on the grounds that they could "find their own exports," and still decided to build two new egg factories. In May and June, the sales of egg products were very poor, and the leading cadres of the company also had disputes over the issue of building new factories, but the result was still the establishment of two new factories.
    In February of this year, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government convened a national egg product conference. Based on the egg product sales situation, it was stipulated that new factories should not start construction, and efforts should be made on the existing basis to reduce costs and improve quality. This conference also assigned specific production figures to various regions and provinces. After this conference, the Shanxi Egg Industry Company did not implement the decisions of the conference. The productive capacity of the company's original four old factories already exceeded the assigned figures by 40 percent, but they still started all six factories at the same time and decided that the production task would be 160 percent of the central allocation. From this incident, it is clear that the Shanxi Provincial Industry Department and the Shanxi Egg Industry Company have serious problems in both capital construction and egg industry management: not starting from the overall situation, not implementing the decisions of the conference convened by the Central Trade Department, and blindly engaging in disorderly work, which is very detrimental to the overall national economic construction. Local industries should be run, but they must be subordinate to the overall national production plan, and tendencies towards localism must not be allowed to exist. The relevant authorities should immediately examine and correct the mistakes of the Shanxi Egg Industry Company.

### 不应盲目地建设新厂

    不应盲目地建设新厂
    各地地方工业正在大力发展，在这个工作中，应注意避免生产上和基本建设上的盲目性和地方主义的倾向。
    山西省蛋业股份有限公司（归山西省人民政府工业厅领导）在一九五○年春天成立，那时共有四个蛋厂。山西省工业厅不了解全国蛋品制销情况，只觉得一九四九年蛋品生产利大，所以就想再开设两个厂。一九五○年三月间，中国蛋品公司曾根据全国蛋品制销情况，建议该省不要再设新厂。但是山西省工业厅以“自己找出口”为理由拒绝了这样的建议，仍决定新建两个蛋厂。到五、六月间，蛋品销路很不好，公司领导干部对于建新厂的问题，也有了争论，但结果仍是建立了两个新厂。
    今年二月中央人民政府贸易部召开了全国蛋品会议，根据蛋品销路情况，规定新厂不要开工，应在原有基础上努力，以求减低成本，提高质量。这次会议并给各地区、各省分配了具体的生产数字。这次会议结束后，山西省蛋业公司，并没有执行会议的决定。该公司原有的四个旧厂的生产力，本已超过分配数字百分之四十，但是他们还是将六个厂一齐开工，并决定生产任务为中央分配数字的百分之一百六十。从这件事情中，表现出山西省工业厅及山西省蛋业公司，无论在基本建设及蛋业经营方面，都存在着严重的问题：不从全局出发，不执行中央贸易部召开的会议的决定，盲目乱干，这对于整个国家经济建设是非常不利的。地方工业是应该办的，但必需服从整个国家的生产计划，决不能容许地方主义的倾向存在。对于山西蛋业公司的错误，有关机关应即检查纠正。
