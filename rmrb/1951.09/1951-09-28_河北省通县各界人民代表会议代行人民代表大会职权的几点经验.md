Several Experiences of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Tong County, Hebei Province, Exercising the Functions and Powers of the People's Congress
Li Jun

    Tong County, Hebei Province, convened its Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles on September 1st, exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress. It elected the county head, deputy county head, and government committee members, discussed and reviewed the government work report, and passed the resolution for the autumn and winter work of 1951. Because the leadership attached importance to it, the meeting was very successful, fully promoting democracy, satisfying the representatives, and resolving various issues relatively smoothly and satisfactorily. The main experiences of this meeting are as follows:

    I. Make good preparations before the meeting and select good representatives. A month before the meeting, the county convened a standing committee meeting to determine the number of representatives and the method of selection, and implemented it through various meetings. The county people's government printed a notice, and the standing committee of the Second People's Representative Conference of All Circles printed a propaganda outline and distributed it to all circles and villages. All propaganda forces in the county were mobilized, assigned to specific areas to take responsibility, and various forms of propaganda were used to widely carry out propaganda activities, quickly explaining the significance of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress and the method of generating representatives to the masses. In particular, people paid great attention to the election of the county head, with many saying, "We have never heard of electing a county head in all our lives! We must elect well this time!" Most people were very serious about electing representatives, and the representatives elected were mostly people with prestige and representativeness among the masses, surpassing the previous two People's Representative Conferences. This can also be seen from the large number of those not re-elected from the second conference: less than 50% were re-elected, and more than 50% were not re-elected. Most of those who were not re-elected this time were those who could not represent the opinions of the masses and were not active in their work; a few were those with improper conduct or unclear history. The masses believed, "We must elect good representatives to elect a good county head." The election method was based on election districts, with each election district having about 500 households; all villages that were election districts were directly elected, and most of the combined villages that were election districts were indirectly elected. The representatives felt honored, believing that they had never been masters of their own affairs like this before. When the representatives went to the county for the meeting, some villages performed Yangko dances to send them off. Ma Dequan, the imam of the Hui people in Yujiafu, personally led more than 200 Hui people to send off the representative He Rulan to the county. This further stimulated the enthusiasm of the representatives. Of the 493 representatives, none were absent except for six who asked for leave due to illness or special circumstances, and their enthusiasm remained high throughout. The grandfather of Wang Zengyi, a farmer representative from Brick Factory Village, died, but he did not ask for leave to go back until the county head was elected.

    II. Widely collect proposals before the meeting and seriously handle proposals during the meeting. Collecting proposals requires giving the representatives sufficient time and mobilizing them to go deep among the masses to widely collect them. Tong County combined collection with propaganda after the new representatives were generated. In mid-August, the county held representative symposiums in separate areas to explain the importance of collecting proposals, which aroused the representatives' attention to the proposals. Most representatives personally went to the masses to earnestly solicit proposals. A total of 1,740 proposals were received this time, twice as many as the second conference, most of which reflected the demands of the broad masses of the people. Of all the proposals, 592 were related to production and construction, 571 to finance and economy, 277 to culture, education, and health, and 169 to political, legal, and public security affairs. It can be seen that the most urgent problems that the masses currently demand to be solved are production, cultural education, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, which are in line with our policies. The county seriously and earnestly reviewed and handled these proposals. The method adopted was: first, the proposal review committee classified and sorted them out, and put forward handling opinions item by item, then submitted them to the group for repeated discussion and consultation, and then passed them at the conference. Facts have proved that this method saves time and can handle the problems satisfactorily. Most of the representatives said with satisfaction, "This time, we can explain it to the masses when we go back!" However, 100 proposals could not be processed because they were received late; some proposals were handled roughly, so they need to be further processed after the meeting, and the processing results should be answered to the representatives in writing. This will improve the representatives' enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, strengthen the representatives' prestige among the masses, and strengthen the connection between the representatives and the people's government.

    III. Fully promoting democracy and repeated consultation are the main keys to making the meeting successful. Before the meeting, the county organized cadres from county and district agencies to study the documents on democratic governance, solved the problem of cadres not paying attention to the representative conference, strengthened the democratic style, and overcame the style of pointing fingers, coercion, and rigidity. Most of the cadres attending the meeting humbly consulted with the representatives and were good at inspiring deliberation. The leadership was also humble and cautious, taking everything seriously, and everything had to go through repeated deliberation, consultation, and discussion before being put to a vote after opinions were fully agreed upon. This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the representatives and fully promoted democracy. Everyone at the conference and in the groups vied to speak and discuss enthusiastically, and those who did not speak originally also expressed their opinions. As the farmer representative Lang Haoxian said: "I originally thought we were called to be wooden stakes, and the government had the final say; now I know it's not like that at all. We discussed even small things again and again, it's really democratic!" The presidium also included representatives from all circles, and everything was done through the presidium. The leadership did not take over everything, making the representatives feel that they had duties and powers, and they tried their best to use their wisdom to powerfully promote the progress of the meeting.

    Electing the county head, deputy county head, and government committee members was the most glorious and solemn task of the conference, and the spirit of democratic consultation was also fully brought into play. The election method was: first, each circle or three or more people jointly proposed a list of candidates from each circle, which was submitted to the delegation for discussion and deliberation. After the opinions were generally consistent, it was determined as the candidate of each delegation. The presidium collected the list of candidates submitted by each delegation, and according to the number of votes, put forward a preliminary list of candidates, which was then sent to each delegation for deliberation and consultation. Only after more than half of the people agreed was it determined as the official candidate. The representatives were very satisfied with this election method and unanimously reflected: "We can elect whoever we want, it's really democratic!" Because ideological education on the united front was carried out among the representatives in advance, the newly elected government committee members included people from all walks of life.

    IV. The establishment of a contact system between the Standing Committee and the representatives is an important issue to strengthen the role of the representatives during the adjournment and to connect the representatives and the government. Because of the lack of such a system during the previous two People's Representative Conferences in the county, the Standing Committee rarely contacted the representatives, and the county and district cadres rarely took the initiative to help them. When the representatives had problems, they had nowhere to turn to in the county, and no one answered their letters. After discussion and consultation at this meeting, the contact system between the Standing Committee and the representatives was adopted, stipulating that the representatives of each circle and region should be divided into groups, and the members of the Standing Committee should participate in the representative group meetings by circles and regions, so as to facilitate regular contact. The Standing Committee holds a meeting once a month, and the representative group meeting is held before and after the Standing Committee meeting. Representatives and voters hold irregular meetings and maintain regular contact. The Standing Committee has a resident member and a full-time secretary during the adjournment, and establishes a registration, processing, and inspection book for letters and proposals, so as to process and answer them in a timely manner. It is stipulated that the Standing Committee directly answers the questions raised by the representatives in no more than five days, and forwards them to the government for processing in no more than seven days. The powers and functions of the representatives and the Standing Committee, and the relationship between the Standing Committee, the representatives, and the government are also stipulated. The establishment of this system is welcomed by the representatives.

    V. The organic combination of the conference and the group meetings. The leadership has grasped the principle of holding more group meetings and fewer conferences. Everything should be discussed and consulted in the group (ten to fifteen people, so that everyone can speak), and then passed at the conference after the opinions are agreed upon. Experience has proved that this not only makes it easier to play a democratic role, but also makes the problems deeper and solves them satisfactorily. For example, the work of handling proposals and investigating land and determining production was originally very complicated, but it was smoothly passed at the conference after full consultation within the group.

    VI. After the meeting, organize forces to implement and convey the resolutions. Only by implementing the resolutions well to the masses can they be turned into practical actions by the masses. In addition to printing the resolutions into single pamphlets and distributing them to each representative, the Standing Committee members and the county and district levels adopted the method of contracted responsibility by circles and regions to assist the representatives in conveying them. And be prepared to mobilize all propaganda forces, and widely carry out propaganda activities through various forms of propaganda, so as to make it known to every household and everyone, and to fully realize the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles.

    河北省通县各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的几点经验
    力军
    河北省通县于九月一日召开了第三届各界人民代表会议，代行了人民代表大会职权，选举了县长、副县长和政府委员，讨论审查了政府工作报告，通过了一九五一年秋冬工作决议。因为领导上重视，这次会议开得很好，充分发扬了民主、代表们很满意，各种问题解决的比较顺利圆满。这次会议的主要经验如下：
    一、会前作好准备工作，选好代表。该县在会前一个月就召开了常委会，确定了代表名额，产生办法，并通过各种会议进行贯彻，县人民政府印制了通告，第二届各界代表会议常委会印制了宣传提纲，发到各界各村。动员了全县所有宣传力量，分片包干负责，采用多种宣传形式广泛开展了宣传活动，把各界代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的意义、代表的产生办法等很快向群众交代清楚，特别是选举县长人民都很注意，许多人说：“多少辈子也没听说过选县长啊！这回可得好好选哪！”大部对选举代表很认真，选出的代表绝大部分是在群众中有威信有代表性的人物，胜过上两届人民代表会议。从二届代表大部落选也可以看出来：连选连任的还不足百分之五十，落选的占百分之五十以上。这次落选的人大部是不能代表群众意见，工作不积极的；少数是作风不正派、历史不清白者。群众认为：“必须选好代表，才能选好县长。”选举办法是以选区为单位，每个选区五百户左右；凡一村为一选区者都是直接选举的，联村为一选区者大部是间接选举的。代表们都感到光荣，认为：像今天这样当家做主历史上从来没有过。代表到县开会时，有的村扭着秧歌欢送，于家府回民教长马德泉亲自领着二百多回民欢送代表何汝兰上县。这样更激发了代表的积极性，四百九十三名代表，除六名因病或特别事故请假外，无一缺席，情绪始终饱满。砖厂村农民代表王增义的祖父死了，也不请假回去，直到把县长选出才回去。
    二、会前广泛搜集提案，会上认真处理提案。搜集提案必须给代表以充分时间，发动代表深入群众广泛搜集，通县在新代表产生后就结合宣传进行搜集。八月中旬该县曾分片召开代表座谈会，说明收集提案的重要性，引起代表们对提案的重视，大部代表亲自到群众中认真地征求提案。这次共收到提案一千七百四十件，比第二届多一倍，绝大部分反映了广大人民的要求。全部提案中，生产建设的占五百九十二件，财政经济的占五百七十一件，文教卫生的二百七十七件，政法公安的一百六十九件，可以看出群众当前迫切要求解决的主要是生产、文化教育、镇压反革命等问题，是和我们的政策相吻合的。该县十分严肃认真地审查与处理了这些提案，采用的办法是：先由提案审查委员会分类整理，逐条提出处理意见，再交小组反复讨论协商，然后再到大会通过。事实证明：这种办法又省时间又能处理的圆满。大部代表都心满意足地说：“这次回去，向群众好交代了！”但是这次有一百件提案因收到时间晚了未能处理出来；有的提案处理得粗糙，因此需要会后继续处理，把处理结果用书面答复代表。这样做会提高代表的积极性和责任心，加强代表在群众中的威信，密切代表与人民政府的联系。
        三、充分发扬民主，反复协商，是使会议开得好的主要关键。该县在会前曾组织了县、区机关干部学习民主建政文件，解决了干部不重视代表会的思想，加强了民主作风，克服了指手划脚、强迫、生硬的作风。与会的大部干部都虚心地和代表协商，善于启发酝酿。领导上也谦虚谨慎，郑重其事，一切事情都要经过反复的酝酿、协商和讨论，意见完全取得一致后，才付诸表决。这样就大大地激发了代表的积极性，充分地发扬了民主，大会小会都争着发言，热烈讨论，原来不发言的也都发表了意见。如农民代表郎浩先说：“原来我认为是叫我们当木头桩子，政府说了算；现在我才知道根本不是那样，不怕一个小事也商量了一回又一回的，真是民主了！”主席团中也包括了各界代表，一切事情都通过主席团去做，领导上不包办代替，使代表们感到有职有权，尽量发挥了自己的智慧，有力地推动了会议的进行。
    选举县长、副县长和政府委员是大会最光荣最庄严的任务，也充分发挥了民主协商的精神。选举办法是：先由各界或三人以上联署提出各界的候选人名单，交到代表团讨论酝酿，意见大体一致后，确定为各代表团的候选人。主席团把各代表团提出的候选名单集中起来，按票数多少提出一个初步的候选人名单，再发到各代表团酝酿协商，经过半数人以上同意，才确定为正式候选人。大会投票是采用无记名联记式投票法，投票时还可以选举候选人以外的人。代表对这种选举法很满意，一致反映：“爱选谁就选谁，真是民主！”由于事前对代表进行了统一战线的思想教育，新选出的政府委员包括有各阶层人物。
    四、制订了常委会与代表联系制度，这是加强代表在闭会期间的作用，沟通代表与政府之间联系的一个重要问题。该县在上两届人民代表会议期间因为缺少这样一个制度，常委会很少与代表联系，县、区干部也很少主动地帮助他们，代表们有了问题到县里没处投奔，来信也没人答复。这次会议经过讨论协商，通过了常委会与代表的联系制度，规定各界各地之代表划分小组，常务委员分界分地区参加代表小组会议，以便于经常联系。常委会每月开
    一次会，代表小组会在常委会议召开前后召开，代表和选民采取不定期的会议，经常联系。常委会在休会期间设驻会委员和专职秘书一人，并建立来信和提案登记处理检查簿，作到及时处理，及时答复，规定代表提出的问题，常委会直接作答复的不超过五天，转请政府处理的不超过七天。对代表与常委会的职权，常委会、代表与政府的关系也都加以规定。这一制度的建立，代表们都很欢迎。
    五、大会和小组会的有机结合。领导上掌握了多开小组会少开大会的原则，一切问题尽量在小组（十至十五人，这样发言才会普遍）内讨论协商，意见取得一致后再到大会上通过。经验证明：这样做不但更容易发挥民主作用，同时问题闹得深刻，解决得圆满。如处理提案，查田定产等工作，本来是很复杂的，在小组内经过充分协商，到大会上便很顺利的通过了。
    六、会后组织力量贯彻传达决议，只有把决议很好的贯彻到群众中去，才能变成群众的实际行动。该县除了把决议印成单行本，发给代表每人一册外，常务委员和县、区并分界分地采用包干负责办法，协助代表进行传达。并准备动员一切宣传力量，通过各种宣传形式广泛地开展宣传活动，以作到家喻户晓，人人皆知，把各界人民代表会议的决议圆满实现。
