    The Jin-Cha-Ji Sub-Group of the Central People's Government Northern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group visited Xibaipo Village in Jianping County (originally part of Pingshan County, Hebei Province, and established during the Anti-Japanese War), where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao lived, in the latter part of last month. In the autumn of 1947, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a land conference in the village and formulated the Outline Land Law. From the end of 1948 to the beginning of 1949, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu victoriously directed the world-renowned Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin Campaigns in the village. The Communist Party of China also held the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in the village. The farmers of the village felt immensely honored that Chairman Mao had led the people of the whole country in the village to achieve the final victory of the Chinese revolution. When the people of this glorious village learned that Chairman Mao was sending a visiting group to see them, everyone put on their new festival clothes, every household swept the streets, and they formed teams to welcome the visiting group with flags. The farmers specially led the visiting group to visit the former residences of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. To commemorate their leaders, people furnished the rooms where Chairman Mao lived according to their original appearance, and the desks were wiped clean. The farmers recalled with enthusiasm Chairman Mao's kind and amiable demeanor when he talked with them in the village. They inquired with concern about the health of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou, Commander-in-Chief Zhu and other leaders, and urged the visiting group to convey their gratitude to the leaders.

    访问毛主席住过的西柏坡村
    农民们叮嘱访问团向领袖们转致谢意
    【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府北方老根据地访问团晋察冀分团于上月下旬访问了中共中央机关和毛主席住过的建屏县（原为河北省平山县之一部，抗日战争时始设此县）西柏坡村。一九四七年秋，中共中央曾于该村召开过土地会议，制订了土地法大纲。一九四八年末到一九四九年初，毛主席和朱总司令在该村胜利地指导了世界闻名的辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役，中国共产党并于该村举行过第七届二中全会。该村农民都因毛主席曾在该村领导全国人民取得中国革命的最后胜利而感到无上光荣。这个光荣的村庄的人民，当他们知道毛主席要派访问团来看望他们时，人人都穿上了节日的新衣，家家打扫街道，结队举旗来欢迎访问团。农民们特地带领访问团去参观了毛主席及朱总司令的故居。人们为了纪念自己的领袖，把毛主席住过的屋子，依照当年的原样陈设起来，办公桌擦得干干净净。农民们充满热情地回忆着毛主席在这村与他们谈话时和蔼可亲的神采。他们关心地询问毛主席、刘少奇副主席、周总理、朱总司令等领袖们的健康并叮嘱访问团向领袖们转致谢意。
