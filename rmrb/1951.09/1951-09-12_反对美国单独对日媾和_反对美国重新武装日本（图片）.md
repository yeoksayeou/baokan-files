Opposing the U.S.'s separate peace treaty with Japan and opposing the U.S. rearming Japan has become the common demand of the Japanese people. These are workers in Tokyo, Japan, who, regardless of the risk of being dismissed and persecuted, are holding high the banner of "Immediately Conclude a Peace Treaty with the Five Great Powers" and participating in a demonstration.

Workers in Tokyo, Japan, held a May Day demonstration this year. This is a crowd of workers holding a banner that reads "Promote Overall Peace, Oppose Rearmament."

On May 30, 1950, the Japanese people held a demonstration. They are fighting with U.S. military police to oppose interference by the U.S. occupying forces.

Workers from various factories in Nagoya, Japan, set out to participate in the May Day demonstration in 1951.

Representatives of the Japan-China Friendship Association held portraits of Chairman Mao and participated in the May Day parade in 1951.

More than 4,000 university students in Tokyo, Japan, held a demonstration to protest the Yoshida government's illegal dismissal of progressive teachers.

Workers at the Hosaka Metal Factory in the Arakawa Ward of Tokyo, Japan, signed petitions in the factory to promote overall peace, oppose rearmament, and oppose turning Japan into a military base.

On the bridge next to the Oji Vocational Placement Office in Tokyo, Japan, a huge banner suddenly appeared that read: "Promote Overall Peace, Withdraw All Occupation Troops, Oppose Rearmament, Oppose Wage Cuts." Japanese unemployed workers who were seeking work in front of the placement office immediately started a signature campaign to promote overall peace and oppose rearmament.

Regardless of the brutal suppression by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, the Japanese people's struggle for overall peace and against rearmament is unfolding extensively. This is a group of young students from Tokyo participating in a May Day demonstration this year. These are Japanese veterans from World War II. Using their personal experiences, they composed lyrics and sang songs expressing their desire for peace and opposition to aggressive war.

On June 26th of this year, more than 200 representatives of disabled soldiers, representing 300,000 disabled soldiers nationwide in Japan, demonstrated in the Ginza district and in front of the National Diet Building in central Tokyo. They held up banners that read, "Compatriots! Do not follow the road we have taken." and "Oppose Rearmament." These disabled soldiers can only receive more than 2,000 yen per year from the reactionary government, which is not even enough for one month's living expenses in Japan today. The prosthetic leg of this disabled soldier has a sign hanging on it that reads: "Look! This leg was lost in the war and is worth six yuan (Note: Yen) a day." The text at the top of the picture means "Footsteps marching towards the anti-war road."

The Japanese Police Reserve Force has completely adopted American-style training. This is one of the training courses for the Japanese Police Reserve Force – practicing American-style map reading.

The Japanese Police Reserve Force, armed by the United States, is equipped with standard U.S. carbines. However, due to a lack of ammunition, all training is done with blank rounds.

As the U.S. imperialists continue to release war criminals, the Japanese fascist military uniforms that have long been despised are now being treated as rare treasures by Japanese second-hand clothing dealers. This symbolizes the gradual revival of Japanese fascist militarism.

    反对美国单独对日媾和
    反对美国重新武装日本
    缔结五大国和平公约和反对重新武装日本，已经成为日本人民的普遍要求。这是日本东京的职工，他们不顾随时有解雇和遭受迫害的危险，高举着“立刻缔结五大国和平公约”的旗帜，参加示威游行。
    日本东京的工人，在今年五一劳动节举行五一示威游行。这是举着“促进全面媾和，反对重新武装”标语牌的工人群众。
    一九五○年五月三十日，日本人民举行了示威游行。他们为了反对美国占领军的干涉，正和美国宪兵进行搏斗。
    日本名古屋各工厂的工人出发参加一九五一年五一示威游行的情形。
    日本日中友好协会代表举着毛主席像参加一九五一年五一示威大游行。
    日本东京四千余大学生举行反对吉田政府非法解聘进步教师的示威游行。
    日本东京荒川区保坂金属工厂的工人，在工厂中签名促进全面媾和，反对重新武装和反对把日本作为军事基地。
    在日本东京王子职业介绍分所旁的桥头上，忽然出现了“促进全面媾和、撤退全部占领军、反对重新武装、反对减低工资”的巨大标语。这时正在介绍分所前谋取工作的日本失业工人，立即进行了促进全面媾和、反对重新武装的签名运动。
    不顾美日反动派的残酷镇压，日本人民要求全面媾和、反对重新武装的斗争，正在广泛地展开。这是今年五一节时参加示威游行的东京的青年学生。这是第二次世界大战中的日本伤兵。他们以亲身经历编作歌词，唱出他们要求和平反对侵略战争的歌声。
    今年六月二十六日，代表日本全国三十万伤兵的二百多名伤兵代表，在东京中心区的银座和国民会议堂前示威游行。他们高举着“同胞们！不要再踏上我们的这路。”和“反对重新武装”的标语。这些伤兵每年只能从反动政府那里领到二千多日元，这一个数目在今天的日本还不够一个月的生活费。这个伤兵的假腿上挂着一个牌子，上面写着：“请看！这条为战争失去了的腿，一天得了六块钱（注：日元）。”图片上端文字的意思是“向反战道路迈进的足音。”
    日本警察后备队完全采取美式训练。这是日本警察后备队训练课程之一——练习美式阅读地图法。
    由美国一手武装起来的日本警察后备队是用普通的美制卡宾枪装备的。但是因为缺乏子弹，所以在训练时全是打空枪。
    随着美帝国主义的不断释放战犯，久已被人唾弃了的日本法西斯军人制服，又被日本估衣商作为稀有的珍物了。这就象征着日本法西斯军国主义正在逐渐地复活。
