Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th -- The Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued an order on September 4th to reclaim fourteen unhanded-over public properties of the former Shanghai French Concession. These are No. 179 Xizang South Road, No. 156 Puan Road, No. 476 Danshui Road, No. 248 Wuxing Road, No. 75 Jianguo West Road, No. 1195 Fuxing Middle Road, No. 691 and No. 700 Jianguo West Road, No. 47 Nanchang Road, No. 57 Nanchang Road, No. 30 Jianguo Middle Road, No. 294 Taiyuan Road (and the workers' residence opposite it), No. 68 and No. 70 Dihua South Road. All the above-mentioned properties were obtained by French imperialism by virtue of the privileges of unequal treaties in the past. Although the concessions in Shanghai had long been abolished, the French side had never returned the above-mentioned properties. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang government negotiated with the French side to recover the above-mentioned public properties, but due to the corruption and incompetence of the Kuomintang government, which consistently colluded with imperialism, although it pretended to negotiate for a year, it still achieved nothing. Now the Shanghai Military Control Commission has ordered the recovery of the fourteen public properties that have been verified.

    上海市军管会发布命令
    收回前法租界公产十四处
    【新华社上海八日电】中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会于九月四日发布命令，收回前上海法租界未移交的公产十四处。即西藏南路一七九号，普安路一五六号，淡水路四七六号，吴兴路二四八号，建国西路七五号，复兴中路一一九五号，建国西路六九一号及七零零号，南昌路四七号，南昌路五七号，建国中路三零号，太原路二九四号（及其对面工人住所），迪化南路六八号及七零号。上述各项产业均系过去法国帝国主义凭借不平等条约的特权取得的，其后上海的租界虽早已取消，但法方迄未交回上述产业。抗日战争胜利后，国民党政府曾与法方交涉收回上述公产，但由于国民党政府腐败无能，一贯勾结帝国主义，因此虽装模作样交涉一年之久，仍毫无结果。现上海市军管会已下令将已查明之公产十四处予以收回。
