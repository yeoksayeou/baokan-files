    Relying on the Party's Political Work
    Northwest Region Exceeds August Cotton Purchase Target
    Thanks to the reliance on the Party's political work and the strengthening of political education for farmers, the Northwest Region has achieved remarkable results in its cotton purchasing and storage work in August. According to statistics up to August 20, in addition to completing the originally assigned task of 12,000 dan, it exceeded the target by more than 1,800 dan.

    In June, the Northwest Region successfully completed its cotton purchasing and storage tasks, exceeding the original plan by 15.45 percent. However, in July, due to neglecting patriotic education for cotton farmers, the cotton purchasing task was not completed. After the Xi'an Masses Daily discovered this deviation, it immediately issued a criticism. Subsequently, the Party organization of the Northwest Financial and Economic Commission convened a special meeting for review. The Northwest Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company and the Northwest Trade Department successively dispatched work teams to various regions for inspection. The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also pointed out that the negligence of political work among farmers, as demonstrated by Party organizations in various regions during the cotton purchasing and storage work, was a major defect in the Party's leadership work, and urged everyone to attach importance to strengthening the Party's political work among farmers. Through continuous criticism and review, various regions in the Northwest Region have begun to attach importance to political work in cotton purchasing. For example, when Xingping County in Shaanxi Province began deploying cotton purchasing and storage work, it estimated that the county had 200,000 jin of stored cotton. However, after the Party and the government conducted patriotic propaganda and education work among cotton farmers, they purchased and stored more than 230,000 jin of cotton.

    These examples fully prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's instruction that "the serious problem is educating the peasants." Strengthening political work among farmers is a decisive link in the Party's work in rural areas.

    依靠党的政治工作
    西北区超额完成八月份购棉任务
    西北区八月份的购棉储棉工作，由于依靠党的政治工作，加强了对农民的政治教育，已收到显著成绩。据至八月二十日的统计，除完成了原布置任务一万二千担外，并超额完成了一千八百多担。
    西北区在六月份，曾胜利完成购棉储棉任务，并超过原计划百分之十五点四五；但七月份因忽视了对棉农进行爱国主义的教育，购棉任务就没有完成。西安群众日报发现这一偏向后，当即提出批评。之后，西北财政经济委员会党组织即召集专门会议进行检查。西北花纱布公司、西北贸易部均先后派出工作组到各地检查。中共中央西北局亦指出了在购棉储棉工作中，各地党组织所表现的轻视对农民的政治工作，是党的领导工作中的主要缺陷，要大家重视加强党对农民的政治工作。经过不断地批评和检查，西北区各地已开始重视购棉工作中的政治工作。例如陕西兴平县开始布置购储棉工作时，估计全县有存棉二十万斤；但党和政府对棉农进行了爱国主义的宣传教育工作后，却收购和储存了二十三万多斤棉花。
    这些实例，完全证明毛主席所指示的“严重的问题是教育农民”的正确性。加强对农民的政治工作，是党在农村中工作具有决定性的一环。
