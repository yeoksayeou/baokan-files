Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: Today, Soviet newspapers published numerous articles commemorating the sixth anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender and the end of World War II. "Red Star" published an essay by Major General Sapozhnikov. "Izvestia" published an article by the newspaper's international affairs commentator, Kudryavtsev.

Major General Sapozhnikov wrote: The Soviet army, under the leadership of the great commander Marshal of the Soviet Union Stalin, played a major role in eliminating the hotbeds of aggression in both the East and the West. The rapid offensive launched by the Soviet army completely crushed the main striking force of Japanese imperialism – the more than one million strong, heavily armed Kwantung Army. Now, the US ruling clique is trying by every means to belittle the role played by the Soviet Union in the war against Japan, but the whole world knows that even before participating in the war against Japan, from 1941 to 1945, the Soviet Union maintained nearly 40 divisions on the Manchurian border, containing the entire Kwantung Army and alleviating the burden on China and the United States in the war against Japanese militarism. The Soviet Union participated in the war against Japan exactly according to the time stipulated at the Yalta Conference, without any delay.

The heroic Soviet soldiers crushed 22 divisions of the Japanese army – the main force of the Japanese Kwantung Army – in Manchuria and captured about 600,000 Japanese officers and soldiers. Japan only surrendered after the Soviet army dealt a decisive blow to the Kwantung Army, a fact that cannot be concealed by American liars. As is well known, Japan still did not surrender even after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki with the aim of using terror tactics.

These facts undeniably prove that the Soviet Union played a decisive role in defeating Japanese imperialism and that the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan on August 9, 1945 greatly accelerated the end of World War II.

The author then pointed out that thanks to the defeat of fascist Germany and imperialist Japan – in which the Soviet Union played a decisive role – the historical victory of the great Chinese people became possible, and the Chinese people were forever freed from the shackles of foreign imperialism. The Soviet armed forces liberated the Korean people from the brutal colonial oppression of Japanese slave owners and freed other Asian peoples from the threat of being enslaved by Japanese imperialists. The Vietnamese people established their own independent democratic republic. In the six years since the defeat of imperialist Japan and the end of World War II, all peace-loving people, led by the great Soviet Union, have been waging a tenacious struggle to safeguard the peace won through war.

The author emphasized that after the end of World War II, the US ruling clique embarked on the path of undermining the Potsdam Proclamation on the elimination of Japanese militarism and the democratization of Japan. The Zaibatsu – the big monopoly capitalists who had always instigated Japan's war gambling – have, in violation of the Potsdam Proclamation, regained their dominant position in the Japanese economy. Major land, sea, and air bases on Japanese territory have been restored. More than 700 Japanese military factories have resumed production. Even according to official materials, the Japanese regular army has more than 250,000 officers and soldiers, which is equivalent to the number of field armies Japan possessed before it invaded China in 1937; this regular army has been re-established under the name of "police." According to foreign newspapers, the US occupation authorities have secretly ordered the Japanese government to immediately begin forming a million-man army. The Japanese navy is also being restored, and it now has more than 450 warships.

The United States is turning Japan into its colony and military base, and is using it as a bridgehead for its war of aggression against the freedom-loving Korean people.

Major General Sapozhnikov concluded: The Soviet government's proposal on the principles for concluding a peace treaty with Japan, put forward in its note of June 10, 1951, has received enthusiastic support from around the world. The people of the world demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan to ensure Japan's development in a peaceful and democratic direction and to guarantee the prevention of the recurrence of Japanese aggression. The Soviet Union, faithful to the principles of the wise Stalinist policy of peace, will continue to firmly defend peace and security in the Far East and the world.

Kudryavtsev wrote in Izvestia that the Soviet Union has always advocated the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, allowing the unlimited development of Japan's civilian industries and export sectors, and turning Japan into an independent, peace-loving, and democratic country. Now, the Soviet Union remains true to its policy of guaranteeing peace in the Far East. The head of the Soviet delegation to the San Francisco conference, Gromyko, said upon arriving in New York that the Soviet Union hoped that the peace treaty with Japan would lay the foundation for the establishment of normal relations between Japan and other countries (especially those most harmed by Japanese aggression), and thus lay the foundation for lasting peace in the Far East.

Kudryavtsev emphasized that, at the same time, the US government's policy toward Japan is to establish a new aggressive bloc in the Pacific, rather than restoring peace in the Far East. Now, the spearhead of US policy in Asia is mainly directed against the countries most deeply harmed by Japanese aggression. As US Supreme Court Justice Douglas said, the pillars of the US ruling clique are "the most corrupt elements in Asia," in other words, those who colluded with the Japanese occupiers during World War II and were despised by the broad masses of the people. This is not accidental.

Kudryavtsev said: The Soviet Union wants Japan to become an independent, peace-loving, and democratic country, and to cooperate with all other Asian countries for the sake of stable peace in the Far East. Kudryavtsev asked: Will the Japanese people allow the American imperialists to destroy the possibility of Japan's national rejuvenation (which was only obtained after the defeat of Japanese militarists in 1945)? The fact that 4,647,625 people of different ages, occupations, and political views in Japan had signed the declaration supporting the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing the rearmament of Japan by August 15 answers this question.

"Labor Daily," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," and other newspapers also published articles commemorating the sixth anniversary of the victory over militarist Japan.

### 苏联各报纪念战胜日本帝国主义六周年  重申全面缔和以确保日本民主化及远东和平的政策  指斥美国变日本为殖民地和军事基地破坏远东和平

    苏联各报纪念战胜日本帝国主义六周年
    重申全面缔和以确保日本民主化及远东和平的政策
    指斥美国变日本为殖民地和军事基地破坏远东和平
   【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：今天苏联各报刊载许多文章，纪念日本帝国主义无条件投降和第二次世界大战结束的六周年。“红星报”登载萨波日尼科夫少将的论文。“消息报”刊载该报国际问题评论员库德里雅夫采夫写的文章。
    萨波日尼科夫少将写道：伟大的统帅苏联大元帅斯大林领导下的苏联军队，对于消灭东方与西方的侵略温床都起了主要的作用，苏军发动的迅速的攻势，完全击溃了日本帝国主义的主要突击部队——一百多万武装到牙齿的关东军。现在，美国统治集团竟千方百计地力图贬低苏联在对日战争中所起的作用，可是全世界都知道，甚至在参加对日战争之前，从一九四一年到一九四五年苏联就在满洲边界上保持着近四十个师的兵力，牵制住了全部关东军，减轻了中国和美国在反对日本军国主义的战争中的负担。苏联一点不差地照着雅尔塔会议上规定的时间参加了对日战争，没有任何拖延。
    英雄的苏军战士在满洲击溃了日军二十二个师——日本关东军主力——并俘虏了日本官兵约六十万人。只是苏联军队对关东军施以决定性的打击以后日本才投降，这是美国说谎家所掩盖不了的事实。如所周知，甚至当美国抱着使用恐怖手段的目的在广岛和长崎投下原子弹以后日本还是没有投降。
    这些事实不容置疑地证明了：苏联对击溃日本帝国主义起了决定性的作用，也证明了苏联在一九四五年八月九日参加对日作战大大地加速了第二次世界大战的结束。
    作者继而指出：由于法西斯德国和帝国主义日本都被击溃了——苏联在这一方面起了决定性的作用——伟大中国人民的历史性的胜利才成为可能，中国人民才永远摆脱了外国帝国主义的枷锁。苏联武装部队从日本奴隶主的残酷的殖民压迫下解放了朝鲜人民，并使亚洲其他人民不再遭受被日本帝国主义者奴役的威胁。越南人民建立了他们自己的独立的民主共和国。在帝国主义日本被击溃，第二次世界大战结束以后的六年中，以伟大的苏联为首的一切爱好和平的人民一直在进行着维护这种用战争赢得的和平的顽强斗争。
    作者着重指出：但是在第二次世界大战结束以后，美国统治集团走上了破坏关于肃清日本军国主义和日本民主化的波茨坦公告的道路。一向策动日本的战争赌博的大垄断资本家——财阀，已经违反波茨坦公告，重新占据了日本经济的主要地位。日本领土上的主要陆、海、空军基地已经恢复。七百多个日本兵工厂已经复工。即使根据官方材料，日本正规军也有官兵二十五万名以上，和日本在一九三七年进攻中国以前拥有的野战军数量相等；这支正规军已在“警察”的名义下重新建立起来。据外国报纸报道，美国占领当局已密令日本政府立即着手成立一支一百万人的陆军。日本海军也在恢复中，这支海军现已拥有四百五十多艘军舰。
    美国正在使日本变成它的殖民地和军事基地，并且已在利用它作为对爱好自由的朝鲜人民进行侵略战争的桥头堡。
    萨波日尼科夫少将结语说：苏联政府在一九五一年六月十日的照会里提出的关于缔结对日和约的原则的建议，已受到全世界的热烈支持。全世界的人民都要求缔结全面的对日和约，以确定日本向和平民主的方向发展，保证防止日本侵略的重演。苏联忠于明智的斯大林和平政策的原则，将继续坚定地保卫和平和远东及全世界的安全。
    库德里雅夫采夫在消息报上撰文指出：苏联一向主张早日缔结全面的对日和约，让日本工业及出口的民用部门无限发展，使日本变成独立的爱好和平和民主的国家。现在，苏联仍然忠于它的保证远东和平的政策。苏联出席旧金山会议的代表团长葛罗米柯在抵达纽约时曾说，苏联希望对日和约会奠定日本与其他国家（特别是受日本侵略之害最重的国家）建立正常关系的基础，并从而奠定远东持久和平的基础。
    库德里雅夫采夫强调指出：与此同时，美国政府对日政策却是要在太平洋建立新的侵略集团，而不是恢复远东的和平。现在美国对亚洲政策的矛头主要是对着受日本侵略之害最深的国家。有如美国最高法院法官道格拉斯所说，美国统治集团的支柱是“亚洲最腐化的分子”，换句话说，就是那些在第二次世界大战与日本占领者勾结，而为广大人民群众所不齿的人们，这并不是偶然的。
    库德里雅夫采夫说：苏联要日本成为一个独立的、爱好和平的、民主的国家，为了远东稳固的和平而与其他一切亚洲国家合作。库德里雅夫采夫问道：日本人民会听任美国帝国主义者毁灭日本民族复兴的可能（这种可能是在一九四五年日本军国主义分子被击溃之后才得到的）吗？日本不同年龄、职业与政见的人们到八月十五日为止已有四百六十四万七千六百二十五人在拥护缔结全面和约、反对重新武装日本的宣言上签了名，这一事实就回答了这个问题。
    “劳动报”、“共青真理报”以及其他报纸也都刊载了纪念战胜军国主义日本六周年的文章。
