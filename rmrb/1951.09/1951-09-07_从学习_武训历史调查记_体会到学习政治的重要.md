    Realizing the Importance of Studying Politics from Learning "The History of Wu Xun"

    To the Editor:
    After reading "The History of Wu Xun" and Tang Lizhi's "Mirror of History," I discovered my past backwardness and, by correcting my misconceptions about Wu Xun, realized the importance of studying politics.

    I am a graduate of the Department of Mathematics and Physics at Xiamen University and have also studied the techniques of taming wild animals. Therefore, I considered myself extraordinary, looked down on studying, and thought my understanding was always correct and that I already knew everything others knew. So, frankly speaking, whether before or after Liberation, I didn't think Wu Xun had anything worthy of respect. However, I always thought and said this: regardless of Wu Xun's motives for establishing schools, since he did set up schools, his actions were always beneficial to people. What I meant was that "education itself has nothing to do with politics." Tracing the roots of this erroneous thinking, I cannot help but think of my principal, Dr. Sa Bendong (deceased, former president of Xiamen University). He told us at the time, "Not asking about politics while studying is the ultimate 'nobility'." Mr. Sa was one of the leading physicists in China in the past. He always used "super-class" and "purely technical" viewpoints to teach us, not knowing that this kind of thinking actually fell into the trap of the reactionary rulers, and people like me followed suit.

    Precisely because I was like this in the past, I thought Wu Xun was nothing good, but also nothing terribly bad. After the publication of "The History of Wu Xun," when my superior, Comrade Wu Zhiping, Deputy Director of the Park Management Committee, assigned me to study it, I thought: my views on Wu Xun are as described above, and all the discussions and criticisms are just the same old thing, not worth reading again. But because this time it was assigned by my superior, I read the article once. This reading was no small matter; it changed my past views. I realized that Wu Xun's motive for "establishing schools" was selfish, and that the "free school" itself served the feudal landlords, local tyrants, and evil gentry.

    I realized the actions of "Wu Xun, this professional beggar," and those "backers" he relied on by selling himself to them. I recalled that some people in Shanghai in the past, after extorting and plundering the people, also did some "relief" and "charitable" deeds to deceive the public. But these "do-gooders" were precisely the culprits who created disasters, poverty, and death. They were outwardly "gentle and refined," "benevolent and moral," but actually hypocrites in sheep's clothing. Wu Xun's "good deeds" belonged to this category. "The History of Wu Xun" clearly tells us this.

    I work in the zoo. After studying "The History of Wu Xun," I had the same feeling as Comrade Tang Lizhi: it not only corrected my erroneous "super-class" and "super-political" understanding, but also made me feel the importance of studying politics. In the future, I will intensify my studies and strive for progress in politics.

### 从学习“武训历史调查记”体会到学习政治的重要

    从学习“武训历史调查记”体会到学习政治的重要编辑同志：
    我读了“武训历史调查记”及汤礼治的“历史的镜子”，发现了自己过去的落后；并从纠正我对武训的错误认识中，体会到学习政治的重要。
    我是一个厦门大学数理系毕业生，还学过驯养野兽的技术。因此我自命不凡，轻视学习，自以为自己的认识都是对的，人家所知道的我都早已知道了。所以平心地讲，无论解放前或解放后，武训对于我并没有什么值得敬重的地方，不过，我终是这样想也这样说：不管武训兴学的动机怎样，他既办了学校，他的行为总是于人有利的。意思就是说：“教育本身与政治无关”。追朔起我这种错误思想的根源来，不能不想起我的校长萨本栋博士（已故，前厦门大学校长）。他当时对我们说：“读书不问政治，乃是无上‘清高’。”萨先生是过去中国有数的物理学家。他一向以“超阶级”、“纯技术”的观点来教我们，殊不知他这种思想实际上正上了反动统治者的圈套，像我这样的人也就跟着上了圈套了。
    正由于过去我这样，所以才会认为武训没有什么好，也没有什么大不了的坏。在“武训历史调查记”发表后，我的上级——公园管理委员会副主任委员武志平同志指定要我学习时，我却认为：我对武训的看法已如上述，一切的讨论批评还不是那一套，不值再读了。但因为这次是上级要我学习，才把这篇文章看了一遍。这一看可非同小可，使我改变了过去的看法。我认识了武训的“兴学”动机既是自私自利；而“义学”本身也是为封建地主土豪劣绅服务的。
    我认识了“武训这个职业乞丐的所作所为，以及他卖身投靠的那些“靠山”。我回想起过去上海有些人，对人民巧取豪夺之余，也曾做过一些“救济”、“乐善好施”的勾当，以迷惑人们的视听。可是这些“善行者”却正是制造灾难、贫困和死亡的罪魁。他们表面上“温文尔雅”、“仁义道德”，实际上却是披着羊皮的伪君子。武训的“善行”也正是属于这一类。“武训历史调查记”清楚地告诉了我们。
    我是在动物园中工作的人，学习了“武训历史调查记”之后，我和汤礼治同志有着同样的感觉，不但纠正了我的“超阶级”“超政治”的错误认识，并感到学习政治的重要。今后我要加紧学习，在政治上求得进步。
