Comrades, honored guests:
    The ceremony for Mr. Song Qingling's acceptance of the Stalin International Peace Prize has begun. First, we would like to express our warm congratulations. We also extend a warm welcome to Mr. Ehrenburg and Mr. Neruda, representatives of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee, who have come to China specifically to award the prize.
    The Stalin International Peace Prize was established on December 20, 1949, by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union authorized the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee, composed of representatives of democratic forces from all over the world, to select five to ten citizens from all countries who have made outstanding contributions to the struggle against aggressive war and the consolidation of world peace, and to award them this highest honor of the Stalin International Peace Prize on December 21st each year, the birthday of Marshal Stalin.
    The Stalin International Peace Prize Committee was formally established in Moscow in April this year and held its first meeting, selecting seven winners of the first Stalin International Peace Prize for 1950. Mr. Song Qingling is one of these seven world peace heroes.
    Mr. Song Qingling was a good assistant to Mr. Sun Yat-sen in his early years. After Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, she consistently stood on the side of opposing feudalism, imperialism, and fascism, and struggled for the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people. She has made great contributions to the welfare of Chinese children, the welfare of the Chinese people, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and the development of world peace. Therefore, she has received the unanimous nomination and decision of the Prize Committee.
    This is naturally an honor for Mr. Song Qingling personally, but it is also an honor for all of us Chinese people. This is a great encouragement to Mr. Song Qingling's efforts to oppose aggressive war and defend world peace, and it is also a great encouragement to all of us Chinese people.
    The Chinese people have had a hundred years of struggle against imperialist aggression. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, we have achieved today's peaceful and happy life. We deeply know that peace is very precious. In order to defend the security of the motherland, the peace of Asia and the peace of the world, the Chinese people have a strong determination, an unyielding and unified will that will not slacken in the slightest.
    Today happens to be the 20th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident." On this day of glorious celebration, reflecting on the tragic and painful day of twenty years ago is of great significance to us. Japanese imperialism was the most brutal aggressive force in Asia. It was defeated mainly due to the joint efforts of the Chinese and Soviet people. But today, American imperialism is fostering the remnants of Japanese imperialism to engage in Asian aggression again. The illegal Japanese Peace Treaty has been signed, and the US-Japan Security Treaty has followed. This is a treaty that is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, preparing for war, and threatening the Asian people and world peace. People all over the world who love peace must rise up and oppose it.
    For more than a year, the peace of Asia has already suffered from local destruction. The American imperialist war of aggression against Korea continues, and the Kaesong armistice talks have repeatedly suffered from the shameless and tyrannical obstruction of the American side, attempting to sabotage them.
    These facts clearly show that American imperialism needs war and does not need peace. The opposition between the two major camps in the world is clearer than ever today. The organizer and leader of the peace camp, the great Marshal Stalin, is constantly encouraging the people of all countries around the world to strive to maintain the cause of peace, while the chief culprit of the aggression camp, the American imperialists, are increasingly frantically baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, and revealing their ferocious true colors.
    But "what will be the result of this struggle between aggressive forces and peace-loving forces?" Marshal Stalin has already clearly told us:
    "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the warmongers succeed in trapping the masses of the people with a web of lies, deceiving the masses of the people, and dragging the masses of the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable."
    The Stalin International Peace Prize is a concrete embodiment of these precious instructions. We Chinese people warmly congratulate Mr. Song Qingling on receiving this highest honor, and sincerely wish to jointly accept these precious instructions through Mr. Song Qingling's acceptance of the honor.
    We must more bravely "take on the cause of maintaining peace," and work together with the great Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world to "defend this cause to the end."
    We firmly believe that the forces of peace will surely defeat aggressive war!

    郭沫若致开会词各位来宾、各位同志：
    宋庆龄先生接受斯大林国际和平奖金的典礼开始了，首先我们要表示热烈的庆贺。对于授予奖金专程来到中国的斯大林国际和平奖金委员会的代表爱伦堡先生和聂鲁达先生表示热烈的欢迎。
    斯大林国际和平奖金的设置是一九四九年十二月二十日苏联最高苏维埃所决定的。苏联最高苏维埃授权给由世界各国民主力量的代表所组成的斯大林国际和平奖金委员会，在每年十二月二十一日斯大林大元帅的诞辰，由世界各国的公民中推选出在反对侵略战争，巩固世界和平斗争中有杰出功勋者五人到十人，授予这最高荣誉的斯大林国际和平奖金。
    斯大林国际和平奖金委员会在今年四月在莫斯科正式成立，召开了第一次会议，推选了一九五○年度第一届斯大林国际和平奖金的得奖者七位，宋庆龄先生便是这七位世界和平功臣中的一人。
    宋庆龄先生早年是孙中山先生的很好的助手。孙中山先生逝世后，一贯地站在反对封建主义、反对帝国主义、反对法西斯主义的立场，为中国人民的解放事业而奋斗。对于中国儿童的福利，中国人民的福利，中苏两国人民的友好，世界和平事业的发展，有了很大的贡献。因此，她得到了奖金委员会一致的推选和决定。
    这自然是宋庆龄先生个人的光荣，但同时也是我们中国人民全体的光荣。这对于宋庆龄先生反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平的努力是很大的鼓励，同时对于我们全中国人民也是很大的鼓励。
    中国人民反对帝国主义的侵略已经有了一百年的斗争历史。我们在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的正确领导之下，争取到了今天的和平幸福的生活，我们深切的知道和平是很可宝贵的。为了保卫祖国的安全，亚洲的和平与世界的和平，我们中国人民具有着坚强的决心，不屈不挠决不丝毫松懈的统一的意志。
    今天适逢其会是“九一八”的二十周年纪念。在光荣庆祝的今天联想到悲愤沉痛的二十年前的今天，对于我们是很有意义的。日本帝国主义是亚洲最残暴的侵略势力，主要由于中苏两国人民的共同努力，把它打败了。但今天美帝国主义又在把日本帝国主义的残余分子扶植起来，再从事亚洲侵略了。非法的对日和约已经签订，美日的安全条约也跟着签了字，这是敌视中苏，准备战争，威胁亚洲人民、威胁世界和平的条约，全世界爱好和平的人民都要起来反对。
    一年多来，亚洲的和平早已遭受着局部的破坏，美帝国主义的侵朝战争还在继续，开城停战谈判屡次遭受着美方无耻横暴的阻挠而企图破坏。
    这些事实明白的表示着，美帝国主义是需要战争而不需要和平的。世界上两大阵营的对立，在今天是再鲜明也没有了。和平阵营的组织者和领导者，伟大的斯大林大元帅，经常不断地在鼓励全世界各国人民为维护和平事业而努力，而侵略阵营的罪魁，美帝国主义者愈来愈疯狂地张牙舞爪，横行霸道，露出了个凶暴的原形。
    但“侵略势力和爱好和平的力量之间的这一斗争，会有怎样的结果呢？”斯大林大元帅已经明白地告诉过我们：
    “如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那末战争就可能变得不可避免。”
    斯大林国际和平奖金正是这些宝贵指示的具体化。我们中国人民热烈的祝贺宋庆龄先生接受了这最高的荣誉，并诚恳地愿意通过宋庆龄先生的接受荣誉而共同接受这些宝贵的指示。
    我们要更勇敢地“将维护和平的事业担当起来”，与伟大的苏联人民和全世界爱好和平的人民共同奋斗，“把这一事业保卫到底”。
    我们坚决地相信：和平势力一定会战胜侵略战争！
