Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco Dispatch: The Japanese peace treaty conference opened here at the Opera House Building on the afternoon of September 4th.

Many of the countries represented by delegations invited to the conference by the U.S. government made no contribution whatsoever to defeating Japanese militarism. It is sufficient to point out that the representatives of Latin American countries account for nearly one-third of the total number of delegations. At the same time, the government of the People's Republic of China, whose 500 million people waged a long and arduous war against Japan and suffered enormous losses in this struggle, was excluded from the conference.

The government of India, another major Asian power, rejected the U.S. draft treaty and refused to participate in the conference. Burma also avoided participating in the conference. Therefore, in order to create the impression that Asian countries were participating in the conference, the United States invited the three puppets of Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai to participate in the conference.

The draft peace treaty was presented at the meeting. This draft was jointly formulated by the U.S. government and the British government in violation of the international obligations they undertook in Cairo, Potsdam, and Yalta. The purpose of this draft is clearly to further enslave Japan by U.S. monopoly capital and to restore Japanese militarism.

Even the American bourgeois newspapers cannot but essentially admit that the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan is aimed at aggression. For example, on the day before the opening of the conference, the New York Times reported that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with the current U.S. draft and strongly opposed explicitly prohibiting Japan from establishing an air force or navy in an international treaty.

The newspaper's reporter, Reston, wrote frankly on September 2nd: The United States intends to rebuild Japan's war power in order to eliminate the so-called "vacuum" that appeared in Asia after Japan's defeat. Reston harped on his clichés about the non-existent Soviet "threat," and under the cover of this cliché, he pointed out that the United States is prepared to risk rebuilding Japanese militarism, just as it is prepared to risk the revival of German imperialism in Europe.

Reston wrote: The Soviet Union faces the prospect that Japan will become more or less a permanent air base (of the United States – note by TASS) on the Asian flank of the Soviet Union, just as Britain is being used as the main base on the European flank of the Soviet Union.

Although the commentaries of the U.S. bourgeois newspapers all endorse the U.S. desire to force other countries to accept its revised treaty, the New York Times pointed out on September 2nd that many of the delegates attending the conference have longer memories of Japan and a deeper understanding of Japan than Americans, and they expressed alarm at the U.S. policy towards Japan.

This sense of alarm is also shared by all democrats in the world who oppose the U.S. separate draft peace treaty with Japan, which is also well known to everyone.

The Soviet government, which unswervingly defends the cause of peace, has decided to participate in the work of the conference. It has announced that it "will send its delegation to the San Francisco conference and will put forward the Soviet government's proposals on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan."

As some American newspapers have pointed out, this decision by the Soviet government has caused confusion among the U.S. ruling circles. The U.S. delegation publicly expressed fear that the speeches of the Soviet delegation at the conference and the suggestions made by the Soviet delegation on the peace treaty with Japan would arouse widespread comments and win the enthusiastic support of the people of all countries, especially the people of Asia. Therefore, it attempted to turn the conference into a mere formality of signing the treaty, and tried its best to prevent discussions on the treaty itself.

As can be seen from a dispatch from the New York Times correspondent in San Francisco on September 3rd, long before the opening of the San Francisco conference, the U.S. delegation began secret negotiations with the delegations of Western countries in an attempt to devise a conference procedure that, in the words of the reporter, would prevent "changes or discussions" of the U.S. draft treaty. The "draft rules of procedure for the conference" jointly drafted by the United States and Britain, which were circulated among the representatives before the opening of the conference, proved this point. The purpose of these rules is to prevent any changes to the U.S.-made separate draft peace treaty with Japan. In other words, its purpose is to turn the conference into a mere signing and ratification of the draft treaty forcibly put forward by the United States and Britain.

According to these rules, each delegation can speak for no more than one hour, and after that, it must wait until all delegations have spoken before speaking again. This means that each delegation can only speak once on the content of the U.S.-made draft treaty, because the United States plans to end the work of the conference within four days. In addition, these rules of procedure authorize the chairman of the conference to interrupt the speeches of representatives and even deprive them of their right to speak, and speeches answering questions are only allowed for five minutes.

The conference was opened by the acting chairman, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson.

Then, after welcoming speeches by San Francisco Mayor Robinson and California Governor Warren, President Truman followed with a speech.

The U.S. President's speech, in summary, mainly praised the activities of the U.S. occupation authorities stationed in Japan and the U.S.-made draft peace treaty with Japan, which, according to Truman, only pursued "peaceful" goals.

However, Truman immediately admitted that after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, the United States intends to allow Japan to join the "defense system" in the Pacific region. Everyone knows that the Pacific "defense system" being established by the United States is aimed at aggression.

Truman insisted that Japan must be rearmed. He also wanted to portray the future bilateral U.S.-Japan agreement, which stipulates that the United States has the right to station troops in Japan, as a "contribution" to guaranteeing world peace.

After Truman's speech, the conference adjourned.

### 阴谋使旧金山会议变成单纯签字工具  美国悍然限制与会各国发言权  美国公开表示害怕苏联提出合理建议

    阴谋使旧金山会议变成单纯签字工具
    美国悍然限制与会各国发言权
    美国公开表示害怕苏联提出合理建议
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社旧金山讯：九月四日下午，对日和约会议在此间歌剧院大厦开幕。
    许多应美国政府之邀出席会议的代表团所代表的国家，对于打败日本军国主义都是毫无贡献的。只要特别指出这一点就够了：拉丁美洲各国的代表占代表团总数的将近三分之一。同时，它的五亿人民对日本进行了长期艰苦的战争，并在这斗争中遭受非常巨大的损失的中华人民共和国的政府，却被排斥在会议之外。
    另一个亚洲大国印度的政府拒绝了美国的和约草案，拒绝参加这一会议。缅甸也避免参加这一会议。因此，为了造成一种亚洲国家参加会议的印象，美国就邀请了老挝、柬埔寨和保大三个傀儡参加会议。
    会上提出了对日和约草案，这个草案是美国政府和英国政府违背它们在开罗、波茨坦和雅尔塔所承担的国际义务而共同制订的。这个草案的目的很明显地是在于使美国垄断资本更进一步奴役日本，在于恢复日本军国主义。
    甚至美国资产阶级报纸实质上也不能不承认美国对日和约草案是以侵略为目的的。例如，在和会开幕的前一天，纽约时报报道说：美国参谋长联席会议同意美国目前的草案，极力反对以国际条约明文禁止日本建立空军或海军。
    该报记者莱斯顿在九月二日坦率地写道：美国打算重新建立日本的战争力量，以消除日本战败之后在亚洲出现的所谓“真空”。莱斯顿大弹其关于根本不存在的苏联“威胁”的滥调，在这种滥调的掩饰下指出，美国准备冒险重建日本军国主义，正如它准备冒险让德国帝国主义在欧洲复活一样。
    莱斯顿写道：苏联面临着这样的前景：日本将变为在苏联亚洲翼侧的多多少少是永久性的空军基地（美国的——塔斯社编者注），正如英国被利用作在苏联欧洲翼侧的主要基地一样。
    虽然美国资产阶级报纸的评论全都拥护美国强要其他国家接受它的修正的和约的意愿，但是“纽约时报”于九月二日指出，参加和会的许多代表，对日本的记忆比美国人久，对日本的认识比美国人深，他们对于美国的对日政策表示惊惶。
    世界上反对美国单独对日和约草案的一切民主人士，也都具有这种惊惶情绪，这也是大家都知道的事。
    坚持不渝地保卫和平事业的苏联政府决定参加和会的工作。它已经宣布了“将派遣它的代表团出席旧金山会议，并且将提出苏联政府关于对日和约问题的建议”。
    正如美国一些报纸所指出的，苏联政府这个决定引起了美国统治集团的混乱。美国代表团公开表示害怕苏联代表团在会上的演说与苏联代表团就对日和约提出的建议会引起广泛的评论，获得世界各国人民，首先是亚洲人民的热烈拥护。因此，它就企图使会议变成纯粹签署和约的表面手续，竭力阻止讨论和约本身。
    从纽约时报驻旧金山记者九月三日的消息中可以看出，早在旧金山会议开幕以前很久，美国代表团就开始与西方国家的代表团举行秘密谈判，企图拟出一种会议程序，这种程序用这个记者的话来说，可以防止“更改或讨论”美国的和约草案。会议揭幕前在代表间传阅的美国与英国共同草拟的“会议议事规则草案”证明了这一点。这种规则的目的是要防止对美制单独对日和约草案作任何更改，换句话说，它的目的是使会议变为单纯签字盖章批准美英所强行提出的和约草案。
    根据这种规则，每一代表团发言不能超过一小时，以后，它必须等待一切代表团全部发言后才能再发言。这就是说，每一代表团只能就美制和约草案的内容发言一次，因为美国计划在四天内就结束会议的工作。此外，这些议事规则授权会议主席可打断代表的发言，甚至剥夺他们的发言权，答复问题的发言只有五分钟。
    会议是由代理主席美国国务卿艾奇逊揭幕的。
    接着，在旧金山市长罗宾逊和加利福尼亚州州长华伦致词表示欢迎后，杜鲁门总统接着发表演说。
    美国总统的演说，归结起来，主要是称赞驻日本的美国占领当局的活动和美制对日和约草案，按照杜鲁门所说，和约草案只追求“和平的”目的。
    但是，杜鲁门又当即承认：在对日和约签订后，美国打算让日本加入太平洋区域的“防御体系”。大家知道，美国正在建立的太平洋“防御体系”是以侵略为目的的。
    杜鲁门力主必须重新武装日本。他也想把规定美国有权利在日本驻军的未来的日美双边协定说成保障世界和平的“贡献”。
    在杜鲁门演说后，和会会议休会。
