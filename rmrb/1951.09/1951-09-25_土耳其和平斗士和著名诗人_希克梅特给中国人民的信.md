Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 24th: A letter written to the Chinese people by Nazım Hikmet, Turkish peace fighter and famous poet, during the Berlin World Youth Festival. The text is as follows:

　　When I myself was very young, I became acquainted with the progressive communist youth of China. I was only nineteen years old at the time.

　　This acquaintance took place in Moscow, at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, named after Comrade Stalin. The Chinese youth went there to study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, without which it is impossible to victoriously carry out the struggle against imperialism, against their lackeys in their own country, for national independence and for the construction of a new life and for peace.

　　I and other Turkish youth in the same university went to Moscow for the same purpose. In the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, there were also youth from the various Eastern republics of the Soviet Union studying, and Marxist-Leninist theory armed them in socialist construction. In this way, we all became the best of friends. Just as in the entire Soviet Union, friendship existed in this university between people of all countries, nationalities, and races.

　　Among my Chinese friends at that time, many are now working in various responsible positions in great China; there were also many who sacrificed themselves in the People's Liberation War, in the guerrillas, and in the underground struggle. They sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the enemies of the Chinese people and the people of the world. In these few lines, I would like to once again express my love for them. After I returned to Turkey from Moscow, my thoughts were always with the Chinese comrades.

　　The people of all of Turkey constantly watch the struggle of the Chinese people with extremely excited wishes and expectations. For Turkish workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals, this struggle is also their own struggle for national liberation and independence, for happiness and peace. Therefore, the Turkish people read with great enthusiasm the poems and articles written by me and other Turkish comrades praising the heroic struggle of the Chinese people.

　　I would like to cite one fact as an example. My long poem "Posokonda and Spau" achieved unprecedented sales in Turkey, and this long poem depicts the heroic struggle of a Chinese youth.

　　In Turkey, everyone says that the victory of the Chinese people is a powerful blow to world imperialism, which is exactly what the Turkish people have been eagerly awaiting for a long time.

　　Even in prison, we were very concerned and familiar with what was happening in China. Our worker comrades, at great risk, organized the reception of radio broadcasts very cleverly and appropriately. Every night we could hear news about China broadcast by Radio Moscow.

　　In recent years, when I was imprisoned for a full ten years, when my health was getting worse and worse, the news from the front lines of New China gave me new strength. I wrote many poems about the heroic deeds of China.

　　At the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival in Berlin in August 1951, I met Chinese youth once again. I was very excited to see that they were all so happy and energetic and thriving. Of course, they could not be otherwise, because they are representatives of the Chinese people, who under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have won their national independence and are working hard for the happiness of their nation; because they are representatives of the great Chinese people who are providing righteous assistance in the liberation struggle of the freedom-loving Korean people.

　　China is already an invincible fortress of peace. The youth of all countries, nationalities, and races around the world welcome the Chinese youth with great love because they know that this is a powerful force in the invincible army of the peace camp.

　　At the festival, I also met with old Chinese comrades. I reminisced with them about the days we spent together at the Eastern University.

　　Once again, we recalled with great excitement every word Comrade Stalin said to us during his lectures.

　　We, old and young comrades, friends from different countries and nationalities, all who are fighting for national liberation, for democracy, freedom, for socialism, and for communism, know that Stalin is peace, Stalin is national liberation, Stalin is socialism, and Stalin is communism.

　　The name of Stalin is synonymous with everything that is most excellent, most beautiful, and most just.

　　I thank the Chinese journalists who gave me the opportunity to briefly express my love and respect for the Chinese people.

　　If the Chinese newspapers can publish these few lines, I would be happier than anything.

    土耳其和平斗士和著名诗人
    希克梅特给中国人民的信
   【新华社二十四日讯】柏林航讯：土耳其和平斗士和著名诗人希克梅特在柏林世界青年联欢节中写给中国人民的信。文如下：
   当我自己还很年青的时候，我就和中国进步的共产主义的青年相识了，我那时才十九岁。
   这个相识发生在莫斯科，在以斯大林同志命名的共产主义东方劳动大学。中国的青年到那里去是为了学习马克思—列宁主义的理论，没有它就不可能胜利地进行反对帝国主义，反对它们在本国的走狗，争取民族独立和建设新的生活以及争取和平的斗争。
   我和同在这一大学里的其他土耳其青年到莫斯科去，也是为了同一个目的。在共产主义东方劳动大学里，也有苏联各东方共和国的青年在那里学习着，在社会主义建设中马列主义的理论武装了他们。这样，我们都成了最要好的朋友。像在全苏联一样，在这所大学里也存在着各国人民间、各个民族和种族间的友谊。
   在我当时的中国朋友中间，有许多现在正在伟大的中国的各种负责岗位上工作；也有许多在人民解放战争中，在游击队中和在地下斗争中牺牲了。他们是在对中国人民与全世界人民的敌人进行斗争中牺牲的。在这几行文字中，我想再一次表示我对他们的热爱。当我从莫斯科回到土耳其以后，我的思念一直和中国的同志们在一起。
   全土耳其的人民经常以极兴奋的愿望和期待注视着中国人民的斗争。对土耳其工人、农民和进步知识分子来说，这一斗争也就是他们自己为争取民族解放和独立，争取幸福与和平而进行的斗争。因此，土耳其人民以极大的热情来读我和其他土耳其同志所作的歌颂中国人民英勇斗争的诗和文章。
   我想举一个事实作为例子来说明。我的一首长诗“泼索孔达和斯巴乌”，获得了在土耳其空前未有过的销数，这首长诗就是描写一个中国青年的英勇斗争的。
   在土耳其，大家都这样说，中国人民的胜利是对世界帝国主义的强有力的打击，这也正是土耳其人民所早就迫切地等待着的事。
   甚至在监狱里面，我们也是很关心和熟悉中国所发生的事的。我们的工人同志冒着极大危险，非常机灵地和妥善地组织收听无线电广播。每天晚上我们都能听到莫斯科电台所转播的关于中国的消息。
   最近数年来，当我在监狱里整整被关了十年的时候，当我的健康愈来愈恶化的时候，新中国前线传来的消息给了我新的力量。我写了许多有关中国英勇事迹的诗。
   一九五一年八月柏林第三次世界青年与学生和平联欢节中，我又一次和中国的青年会见了。我非常兴奋地看到他们都是那么幸福和那么朝气勃勃。当然，他们也不可能是别的，因为他们是在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下赢得了自己民族的独立并为自己民族的幸福而努力工作着的中国人民的代表；因为他们是在爱好自由的朝鲜人民的解放斗争中给与正义的援助的伟大中国人民的代表。
   中国已经是一个不可战胜的和平堡垒。全世界各个国家、民族和种族的青年都以极大的爱戴欢迎中国的青年，因为他们知道，这是和平阵线的无敌的大军中一支强有力的队伍。
   在联欢节中，我又与中国老同志会见了。我和他们回忆着在东方大学一起过的日子。
   我们又一次以极兴奋的心情回忆着斯大林同志对我们讲课时的每一个字。
   我们，老的和少的同志，各个不同国家不同民族的朋友，所有为民族解放、为民主、自由、为社会主义和为共产主义而斗争着的人们都知道，斯大林就是和平，斯大林就是民族解放，斯大林就是社会主义，斯大林就是共产主义。
   斯大林的名字就是一切最优秀的、最美好的、最正义的东西的同义语。
   我感谢中国的记者，他们给我机会能够简短地表达我对中国人民的热爱和敬意。
   如果中国的报纸能够刊载这几行文字，那是我最高兴不过的了。
