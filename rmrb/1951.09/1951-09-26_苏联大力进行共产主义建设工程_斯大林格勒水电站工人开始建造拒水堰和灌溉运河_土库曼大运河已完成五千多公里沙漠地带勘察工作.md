(Xinhua News Agency, September 24th) According to TASS: The Soviet Union's great communist construction projects are being vigorously carried out.

    Construction work at the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station is accelerating daily. In the main construction area on the left bank of the Volga River, hundreds of powerful excavators, tractors, and trucks are working, where concrete dams, sluice gates, and power plants will be built. Railroads and highways are being constructed on the right bank of the Volga River. Construction workers have begun building the hydroelectric station's water barrier and an irrigation canal over six hundred kilometers long. By the end of the year, the total earthwork will reach four million cubic meters, and more than a thousand tons of metal plates will be sunk into the bottom layer of the water barrier. Engineers have developed a new method for sinking metal plates into the water, increasing work efficiency fivefold and greatly accelerating the construction of the water barrier.

    At the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, in Stavropol, six kilometers from the construction site, enormous construction work is underway for a new city on the shores of the world's largest reservoir, "Kuibyshev Sea." Schools and kindergartens are being built in the city, preparing to enroll students this year. Once the "Kuibyshev Sea" is completed, the water level of the Volga River there will rise by twenty-six meters, and the existing city of Stavropol will be submerged.

    Construction workers on the Volga-Don Canal are striving to complete the excavation of the navigable canal connecting the Volga and Don rivers ahead of schedule and to build several irrigation canals. Powerful excavators are working day and night on the plains between Tsimlyansk and Rostov, where many canal beds will gradually extend into the Rostov Oblast steppes. Diggers are operating day and night on the 190-kilometer trunk canal from the Tsimlyansk Reservoir to the Proletarskaya village.

    At the Turkmen Main Canal, survey teams composed of geologists, topographers, soil and forestry experts have completed the survey work of over 5,000 kilometers of desert area in western Turkmenistan. They have formulated plans for irrigating pastures and irrigating land for planting feed crops, developed diagrams showing the nature of groundwater flow, and created new methods for using sunlight and wind power to distill saline groundwater. After a two-month survey in the eastern Turkmenistan region, the expedition team of the Fruit Cultivation Institute of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences has discovered the great potential of this region for fruit cultivation.

    The Soviet people warmly support the communist construction projects. More than one hundred large enterprises in the Sverdlovsk Oblast have participated in the socialist competition to complete orders needed for the early completion of the project. Thirty-five factories and twenty-eight scientific research and design institutions in Leningrad have participated in the construction work, and large quantities of wires, steel cables, lifting, and transportation equipment are constantly being transported to the construction areas. Workers at the Kirov Electric Power Plant are exceeding their work quotas by more than one and a half times every day, and they have contributed more than four hundred high-efficiency welding machines and instruments to the construction project. The Ural Heavy Machinery Plant has built the famous super dredger and automatic excavator. The dredger is equipped with a 7,000-horsepower generator and can dredge 1,000 cubic meters of mud per hour. The excavator weighs 1,200 tons, can dig trenches 35 meters deep, and dump the soil more than 100 meters away.

    苏联大力进行共产主义建设工程
    斯大林格勒水电站工人开始建造拒水堰和灌溉运河
    土库曼大运河已完成五千多公里沙漠地带勘察工作
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联伟大的共产主义建设工程正大力进行着。
    斯大林格勒水电站的建设工作正在日益加速。在伏尔加河左岸的主要工程地带，数百部强大的挖掘机、拖拉机和卡车正在工作着，那里将要建筑水泥堤坝、水闸和电力厂。伏尔加河右岸正在建造铁路和公路。建筑工人们已开始建造水电站的拒水堰和长达六百余公里的灌溉运河。到年底为止，土工总量将达四百万立方公尺，一千多吨金属板将沉入拒水堰底层。工程师们已研究出向水里沉下金属板的新方法，把工作效率提高到五倍，大大加速了拒水堰的建筑工作。
    在古比雪夫水电站，在距离工地六公里远的斯塔夫罗波尔，正在进行着巨大的建设工作，这就是世界最大的水库“古比雪夫海”岸边的新城市。城市内正建筑学校和幼稚园，准备今年招收学生。“古比雪夫海”完成后，那里伏尔加河的水位将提高二十六公尺，现有的斯塔夫罗波尔城将沉没海底。
    伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑工人正在努力争取提前完成开凿连接伏尔加河与顿河的通航运河，并建造若干灌溉水渠。强大的挖掘机正在齐姆良斯克至罗斯多夫一带的草原上工作，许多运河河床将来要逐渐伸展到罗斯多夫州草原上去。在齐姆良水库到普罗列塔斯卡雅村的一百九十公里的干线运河上，掘土机正在昼夜开动。
    在土库曼大运河，由地质学家、地形学家、土壤与森林学专家组成的勘察队，已完成了西土库曼五千多公里沙漠地带的勘察工作。他们已制定了灌溉牧场和灌溉种植饲料作物的土地的计划，制定了表明地下水流性质的图样，并创造了利用日光和风力蒸溜含盐的地下水的新方法。乌兹贝克科学院水果培育所的考察队，在东土库曼地区考察了两个月以后，已发现这个地区具有种植水果的巨大可能性。
    苏联人民热烈支持共产主义建设工程。斯维德洛夫斯克州一百多所大企业参加了提前完成工程所需的订货的社会主义竞赛。列宁格勒已有三十五家工厂和二十八个科学研究与设计机关参加建设工作，大批的电线、钢缆、起重及运输装备正不断运往建设地带。基洛夫电力工厂的工人每天的工作都超过他们工作定额一倍半以上，他们已为建设工程贡献了四百多件高效率的焊接机和仪器。乌拉尔重型机械制造厂已造出了著名的超级吸泥机和自动挖土机。吸泥机装有七千匹马力的发电机，每小时吸泥一千立方公尺。挖土机重一千二百吨，可挖掘三十五公尺深的壕沟，并把泥土倾卸到一百公尺以外的地方去。
