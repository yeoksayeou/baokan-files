Information About Song Jingshi
    Wang Zhulou

    The "Report on the Investigation of Wu Xun's History" published by the "Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team" narrates the revolutionary deeds of Song Jingshi, a peasant revolutionary leader in Shandong who lived at the same time as Wu Xun. This is an extremely valuable discovery. Inspired by it, I began to collect information about Song Jingshi. Old history books written from the standpoint of the ruling class often go to great lengths to slander and distort revolutionary figures and events. However, despite the slander and distortion, "true gold fears no fire," and "facts speak louder than words." In the lines and between the lines, and on the reverse side, it is still possible to see the truth of history. (Of course, it is often not completely sufficient.) Now I will write a summary of the information about Song Jingshi, hoping to play a role in "throwing a brick to attract jade."

    (1) Song Jingshi was born in Liuguanzhuang (now Xiaoliuguanzhuang) in Tangyi County, Shandong Province (now under the jurisdiction of Pingyuan Province). He learned boxing and martial arts from an early age and acquired good martial arts skills. Old history books say that he "first learned wrestling games, using his strength to dominate the village." [1] In 1854 (the fourth year of Xianfeng), he served as a soldier under Zhang Liangji, the Manchu Qing Shandong Governor. He also served as a coach in the home of Wu Zanhua in Wujiazhuang (Wu Xun's hometown) in Tangyi County for more than a year. In 1861 (the eleventh year of Xianfeng), he was a coach in the home of a man surnamed Han in Guan County. The social contradictions at that time became increasingly acute, and in that year, because he could not bear the oppression and harm of the ruling class, he united the majority of peasants, raised the flag of rebellion, and called themselves the "Black Flag." [2]

    (2) Wu Minhe was the nephew of Wu Zanhua, a Manchu Qing tribute student, and lived in the same village as Wu Xun. Inspired by Song Jingshi's revolutionary spirit, he also joined the revolutionary ranks and became the leader of a peasant revolutionary army. [3] Comparing Wu Minhe with Wu Xun further shows how ugly Wu Xun's act of relying on the landlord class to exploit the peasants was!

    (3) The brotherly troops who revolted at the same time as Song Jingshi (Black Flag) also included the peasant revolutionary armies of the Yellow, Red, Blue, White, Flower, Large Green, and Small Green Flags. Many of them never "surrendered" and fought resolutely to the end, such as Zhang Shanji of the Yellow Flag, Gao Laowen of the Red Flag, and Zuo Linming of the Blue Flag. Even Cheng Wujie (Cheng Wugu) of the White Flag was a female hero with strong fighting spirit and bravery. [4]

    (4) The peasant revolutionary army led by Song Jingshi used the black flag as a symbol, and there was also a red flag with the word "Song." After the uprising, in conjunction with the brotherly troops, they occupied the county towns of Qiu County, Guan County, Xin County, Guantao County, Yanggu County, Guancheng County, Tangyi County, Chaocheng County, Puzhou, Qinghe County, Quzhou County, Xinhe County, Guangping County, and many large and small towns in Shandong Province and Zhili Province (now Hebei Province) at that time, and established a vast base area. In the Battle of Shazhen, the Manchu Qing Daotai Mingxin and Prefect Qin Jilong were wounded and fell from their horses. In the Battle of Acheng, the Manchu Qing garrison commander Chen Zhaoxuan was killed. In the Battle of Wangjiahai, the Manchu Qing guerrilla Li Zhiyun was killed. In the Battle of Dachang, the Manchu Qing Deputy Dutong Chengbao was captured alive. (Old history books say: "Deputy Dutong Chengbao was wounded and fell from his horse, and was helped away by bandits, and returned the next day.") [3] They also killed the Manchu Qing Daotai Qin Jukui and the county magistrates of Zanhuang, Qinghe, Gaoyi, and Quzhou. The two great victories of Qingshui Town and Lier Village were even more glorious. Song Jingshi also personally led the troops into the county town of Wuyi, opened the prison, killed the Manchu Qing escort commissioner, and seized 20,000 taels of silver that had just been escorted from Tianjin to the Manchu Qing army. [5]

    (5) Regarding the issue of Song Jingshi's temporary "surrender," it can be seen that it was a "surrender" in name only, and in essence, he was always an enemy of the Manchu Qing soldiers and the Liulin Regiment. Just nine days after the so-called "surrender," the Manchu Qing Deputy Dutong sent Zhao Yulin and others to Song Jingshi to issue merit plaques, flags, and ammunition, and set a time limit for inspection. However, old history books say that "Yulin and others were almost killed." [2] Old history books also say that "Jingshi and others did not fight when they encountered bandits, but retreated while blowing their lips and roaring," [6] "Song Jingshi's name was surrender, but his intentions became more ferocious and rebellious," [7] "Song Jingshi pretended to request to be transferred to the camp, but secretly entrenched himself," [8] and "Jingshi sent his party member Liu Houde to ostensibly assist the government army in suppressing bandits, but secretly colluded with the bandits to support them." [1] (What the ruling class calls "ferocious and rebellious" is precisely strong in fighting spirit. Calling the peasant revolutionary army "bandits" or "rebels" is all slander). During the so-called "surrender," Song Jingshi actively expanded his strength. On one occasion, he publicly requested the Manchu Qing government to add 3,000 cavalry. The Black Flag's lineup later became even stronger, with more than 7,000 cavalry and infantry. The Manchu Qing emperors and civil and military officials knew that the so-called "surrendered people" were unreliable and fake, but they could do nothing about it. At that time, the common people ridiculed them as "raising a tiger for self-defense."

    (6) The Manchu Qing government tried its best to use conspiracies to lure Song Jingshi, and successively "awarded" the so-called "fifth-grade top cap and peacock feather," "Dusihammer and peacock feather," "deputy general" (twice), and "Baturu" titles, [9] but Song Jingshi was never moved and finally "rebelled." After Song Jingshi moved westward with the Manchu Qing soldiers, he twice publicly resisted the "orders" of the Manchu Qing commanders and led his troops back east. The first time was in March 1862 (the first year of Tongzhi). From Chenzhou, Henan Province, he led the cavalry and infantry teams and marched overnight to the Lanfeng County area. After counterattacking the Manchu Qing Deputy General Bayanga in Zhongmu County, he advanced towards the Jingshui Town area, but failed to achieve the goal of returning east. The second time was in November of the same year. He pulled out from Tongzhou, Shaanxi Province, crossed the Yellow River from Baimadu, passed through Jishan County, Jiangzhou Prefecture, Pingyang Prefecture, Zhaocheng County, and Xugou County in Shanxi Province, and entered the territory of Huolu County in Zhili Province, passing south through Nangong County and Zaoqiang County, until Linqing Prefecture in Shandong Province. This march took 23 days, passing through the four provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Zhili, and Shandong. The "government soldiers" and "local militias" in various places along the way did not dare to stop them, and the peasant revolutionary army marched mightily to its original base area.

    (7) Song Jingshi and the landlord class's armed forces (Liulin Regiment) were mortal enemies. Liu Changyou, a Manchu Qing commander, once reported to the Manchu Qing emperor: "The bandits in the Tangyi Liulin Regiment are all enemies, vowing to destroy the regiment before they are happy." [10] According to records, Song Jingshi attacked the Liulin Regiment a total of twelve times. In the second time, he killed the reactionary regimental leader and big landlord Yang Mingqian. In the fifth time, he used cannons to break the fence of Liulin. Old history books say that the Liulin Regiment "suffered many casualties and barely avoided being captured." [6] In the seventh time, he killed 113 regimental soldiers and surrounded the Liulin Regiment and Fanzhai Regiment with more than 1,000 cavalry and infantry, and seized more than 200 acres of ripe wheat.

    (8) The peasant revolutionary army killed the rich and helped the poor. Near the county town of Shou Zhang, they led the poor people to harvest the ripe wheat in the landlords' fields, taking two liters out of every dou, and giving eight liters to the poor people. In the four prefectures and counties of Tangyi, Xin County, Liaocheng, and Linqing, Song Jingshi ordered the landlords to divide half of the harvested wheat and grain to the tenants and half to the peasant revolutionary army's camps. [7] The general public was very protective of the peasant revolutionary army. When the peasant revolutionary army counterattacked the "government soldiers" in Sang'a Town, many women and children took wooden shovels and brooms to spread sand and soil to help the momentum. [11] That vivid feat is very worthy of being made into a beautiful painting or film.

    (9) The reactionary armed forces - the "foreign gun team" - manufactured and led by the British imperialist Kenai (Gnai) in Tianjin became accomplices of the Manchu Qing government and repeatedly invaded the peasant revolutionary army, causing considerable damage to the revolutionary forces. [12] Imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, and this is another powerful proof!

    (10) Regarding the ending of Song Jingshi, there are different statements. In addition to the information provided in the "Report on the Investigation of Wu Xun's History," old history books also say that "Song Jingshi led more than a hundred of his defeated and remnant people, escaped to Diao'e Ridge in Feicheng, and scattered their weapons. Song Jingshi only had Xia Qi with him, escaping to the mountains in the northeast," and "Song Jingshi and his brother Jingshu and nephew escaped to the mountains in the southeast." [13] Others say that "Song Jingshi, who was on the run, was reported by Pingyin County, Shandong Province, that the bandit leader Xue Faqi and others were searched and confessed that Song Jingshi was wearing a blue cloth cotton-padded jacket, posing as someone surnamed Kong, and riding a horse to escape into the mountains." [14] In fact, after the war situation changed in 1863 (the second year of Tongzhi), Song Jingshi defected to the Nian Army, united as one, and constantly fought against the Manchu Qing soldiers in Henan and Shandong. Moreover, when the main force of the Manchu Qing army was annihilated and the great executioner Senggelinqin, who had repeatedly devastated the revolutionary forces (the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Army), was killed on May 18, 1865 (April 24, the fourth year of Tongzhi), Song Jingshi also participated in the war. Old history books say: "In February of the fourth year of Tongzhi, the Nian chiefs Zhang Zongyu, Niu Laohong, and Ren Zhu colluded with the rebels Lai Wenguang and a large number of party members, fled to Weishi and Zhongmu in Henan, and approached the south bank of the Yellow River. The rebel Song Jingshi was also among them." [8] It also says: "On March 12, the fourth year of Tongzhi, Liu Changyou reported that... according to reconnaissance, Song Jingshi, after being defeated by government troops in Queshan, led more than 2,000 mounted bandits, divided into groups and hurried away, and claimed to return to Tangyi to avenge his former enemies. Senggelinqin's entire army tracked and chased closely... Now, according to reconnaissance, the bandits who fled to Caozhou from Kaocheng, Dingtao and other places include Song Jingshi. He claimed to return to Tangyi to seek revenge on the Liulin Regiment." [15] It also says: "In April of the fourth year of Tongzhi, Guorui reported that on April 26, relatives of Prince Senggelinqin, Fukejing'a and others, rushed to Ji and cried that on the 24th, the prince was pursuing the bandits at Gaolouji, west of Caozhou City,... The rebel saw our army and immediately lined up to resist. This time, the rebel crossed the river from Yuanlukou in Wenshang County and fled to the Shuitao area northwest of Yuncheng, colluding with the bandits in northern Yuncheng, gathering tens of thousands of cavalry and infantry, which was very fierce. After Senggelinqin supervised the army to repel them, he led the cavalry and infantry to pursue them. Unexpectedly, all the ambushers came out, and our army was surrounded by the bandits. The prince ordered the cavalry to break through, and finally led the defeated cavalry and infantry to Zha Huangzhuang, and was wrapped up layer by layer by the rebel. Senggelinqin led the cavalry and infantry to break through the bandit encirclement at night. The rebel pursued and attacked in large numbers, and the prince died in battle after exhausting his strength about ten miles west of Caozhou Prefecture... etc.... The emperor ordered the Grand Council... saying that although this group of bandits is a desperate enemy, there are well-known rebel chiefs such as Niu Laohong, Zhang Zongyu, Chen Da,? Song Jingshi, and Lai Wenguang, who are unusually cunning." [16] It also says: "In the second year of Tongzhi, Song Jingshi disguised himself and fled south, joining the Anhui Nian Army. In March of the fourth year, the Nian Army fled from Kaocheng and Dingtao to northeast Caozhou. Song Jingshi led 2,000 mounted bandits, claiming to return to Tangyi, and the entire border was alarmed. In April, Prince Seng chased the bandits in Caozhou and was ambushed and died. The Nian chiefs Niu Laohong, Zhang Zongyu, Chen Da?, Lai Wenguang, Song Jingshi and others gathered in Shuitao, colluding with local bandits in Yuncheng, with more than 100,000 cavalry and infantry, extending hundreds of miles from north of Caozhou to Pu and Fan, east to Juye and Jiaxiang, and west to Dongming and Dingtao. Hebei was greatly shocked." [17] These historical materials, on the one hand, are sufficient to serve as evidence that Song Jingshi joined the Nian Army and united as one, and on the other hand, illustrate the strength of the revolutionary troops.

    有关于宋景诗的资料
    王竹楼
    “武训历史调查团”所发表的“武训历史调查记”叙述了和武训同时的山东农民革命领袖宋景诗的革命事迹。这是一个极有价值的发现，我受到它的启示，就开始搜集有关于宋景诗的资料。站在统治阶级立场所写的旧史书，对于革命人物和事迹，常是极尽诬蔑和歪曲的，但是尽管诬蔑，尽管歪曲，“真金不怕火炼”，“事实胜于雄辩”，在它的字里行间，在它的反面侧面，仍然能够看得出历史的真相。（当然常是不够完全的。）我现在把有关于宋景诗的资料摘要地写出几项来，希望能够起些“抛砖引玉”的作用。
    （一）宋景诗出生于山东省堂邑县（今属平原省）的刘官庄，（即现在的小刘贯庄），从小学习拳棒，学得一身好武艺。旧史书说他“初习角羝戏，以膂力雄一乡”。〔一〕于一八五四年（咸丰四年），曾在满清山东巡抚张亮基部下当兵。又曾在堂邑县武家庄（武训的家乡）武赞化家里充当教练，不只一年。于一八六一年（咸丰十一年），在冠县一个姓韩的家里当教练，当时的社会矛盾日益剧烈，他就在这年因为不甘忍受统治阶级的压迫与危害，联合了多数农民，举旗起义，号称“黑旗”。〔二〕
    （二）武敏合，是满清贡生武赞化的侄子，和武训住在一村，因为受了宋景诗革命精神的感召，也投入革命阵营，而且作了一支农民革命军的率领者。〔三〕用武敏合与武训作一个对比，更显示出来武训投靠地主阶级剥削农民的种种事实，是如何的丑恶了！
    （三）和宋景诗（黑旗）同时起义的兄弟部队，还有黄、红、蓝、白、花、大绿、小绿各旗的农民革命军。其中有许多始终没“投降”而坚决斗争到底的，如黄旗张善继、红旗郜老文、和蓝旗左临明等。更有白旗的程五姐（程五姑），则是斗志坚强英勇善战的女英雄。〔四〕
    （四）宋景诗所领导的农民革命军是用黑旗做标志，而另有“宋”字红旗。起义以后，联合着各兄弟部队，曾占据邱县、冠县、莘县、馆陶县、阳谷县、观城县、堂邑县、朝城县、濮州、清河县、曲周县、新河县、广平县等县城，和当时山东省直隶省
    （今河北省）许多的大小乡镇，建立了广大的根据地。沙镇一战，打得满清道员明新和知府秦际隆落马受伤。阿城一战，杀死满清守备陈兆烜。王家海一战，杀死满清游击李芝芸。大厂一战，活捉满清副都统成保。（旧史书说：“副都统成保受伤落马，为匪扶去，次日舁回”。）〔三〕又曾阵斩满清道员秦聚奎和赞皇清河高邑曲周等县的知县。清水镇和梨儿庄的两次大捷，战绩更是辉煌。宋景诗并曾亲自率众攻进武邑县城，开放监狱，杀死满清的解饷委员，缴获刚由天津解送满清官军的饷银二万两。〔五〕
    （五）关于宋景诗一度“投降”的问题，可以看得出是名义上“投降”，而实质上是始终在与满清官兵和柳林团为敌的。刚刚在所谓“投降”后的第九天，满清副都统派遣赵玉林等给宋景诗送发功牌旗帜和军火，并限期听候点验，旧史书里却说“玉林等几为所杀”。〔二〕旧史书里又说“景诗等遇贼不交锋，彼此吹唇唱吼而退”，〔六〕“宋景诗名为降伏，心迹转益凶悖”，〔七〕“宋景诗阳请应调随营，阴实负嵎自固”，〔八〕和“景诗遣其党刘厚德阳助官军讨贼，阴与贼通声援”。〔一〕（统治阶级所说的“凶悖”，正是斗争性坚强，把农民革命军称为“贼”“匪”或“逆”，都是诬蔑）。宋景诗在所谓“投降”期间，积极扩充实力，有一次曾向满清政府公开提出增添马队三千的要求。黑旗的阵容以后果然更强大起来，拥有马队步队共七千多人。满清的皇帝和文官武将们明知所谓“降众”是不可靠的，是假降的，但却莫可如何，当时的老百姓则讥笑他们是“养虎自卫”。
    （六）满清政府对宋景诗曾尽力使用阴谋，实行利诱，而顺次“赏给”所谓“五品顶带花翎”“都司衔花翎”“参将”（前后两次）和“巴图鲁”等职衔名号，〔九〕但宋景诗绝不为所动，而终于“复叛”了。宋景诗随着满清官兵往西开动以后，曾有两次公开反抗满清统兵大员的“命令”而率众东归的事实。第一次是一八六二年（同治元年）三月里，由河南省陈州，率领马步各队，乘夜向兰封县一带开拔，于中牟县反击满清副将巴扬阿以后，向京水镇一带挺进，这次没能实现东归的目的。第二次是于同年十一月，由陕西省同州拔队，从白马渡抢渡黄河，经过山西省的稷山县绛州平阳府赵城县徐沟县等地，东入直隶省的获鹿县境，往南经过南宫县和枣强县，直到山东省的临清州。这次行军，以二十三天的时间，经过陕西、山西、直隶、山东等四省，沿途各地的“官兵”和“团练”都不敢拦阻，农民革命军却浩浩荡荡地进到了原有的根据地。
    （七）宋景诗和地主阶级的武装（柳林团）是死对头。满清统兵大员刘长佑曾向满清皇帝奏报说：“堂邑之柳林团，各匪皆与为仇，誓必破其团而后快。”〔一○〕据有记载可查的，宋景诗攻打柳林团前后共有十二次。在第二次就把那个反动团总大地主杨鸣谦杀死了。第五次曾用炸炮打破柳林的围栅，旧史书说柳林团“死伤甚多，仅得勿陷”。〔六〕第七次杀死团丁等一百一十三人，并以马步队一千多人围攻柳林团和樊砦团，收走了二百多亩的熟禾。
    （八）农民革命军杀富济贫，在寿张县城附近，曾领导贫民收割地主田里的熟麦，每斗抽用二升，以八升归贫民所有。宋景诗在堂邑莘县聊城临清四州县，曾勒令地主，把所收的麦谷，一半分给佃户，一半送到农民革命军的营垒里。〔七〕一般老百姓对于农民革命军是非常爱护的，当农民革命军在桑阿镇反击“官兵”扫荡的时候，很多妇女儿童都拿木掀扫帚播扬沙土，以助声势。〔一一〕那种活生生的壮举，很值得制作成一幅美好的绘画或影片。
    （九）英国帝国主义所派遣的克乃（格乃）在天津所制造统率的反动武装——“洋枪队”，做了满清政府的帮凶，屡次侵犯农民革命军，使革命力量受到相当重大的摧残。〔一二〕帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，这又是一件有力的佐证！
    （十）关于宋景诗的结局，说法不一样。除去“武训历史调查记”所提出的资料以外，旧史书里还有的说“宋景诗率其败残百余人，逃至肥城之雕鹅岭，抛械四散。宋景诗只余夏七一人跟随向东北山中逃走”，和“宋景诗与其弟景书叔侄三人赴东南山中逃走”。〔一三〕又有的说“在逃之宋景诗，据山东平阴县禀报，搜获贼目薛法起等供称，宋景诗身穿蓝布棉袄，冒充孔姓，乘马向山路逃逸等语”。〔一四〕实在宋景诗于一八六三年（同治二年）战争形势变化以后，却投奔捻军，联成一体，不断地在河南山东各地对满清官兵作战，而且当一八六五年五月十八日（同治四年四月二十四日）歼灭满清官军的主力杀掉那个屡次摧残革命力量（太平天国和捻军）的大刽子手僧格林沁的时候，宋景诗也参加了战争。旧史书里说：“同治四年二月，捻酋张总愚牛老洪任柱纠合发逆赖文光大股党众，窜扰河南尉氏中牟，逼近黄河南岸，漏逆宋景诗亦在其中”。〔八〕又说：“同治四年三月十二日，刘长佑奏言，……又据探闻，宋景诗由确山被官兵击败后，带领马贼二千余人，分股疾趋，并声言欲回堂邑，报复前仇，僧格林沁全军跟踪紧蹑等情。……，现据探报，由考城定陶等地窜扰曹州之贼匪即有宋景诗在内。声言欲回堂邑，与柳林团寻仇”。〔一五〕又说：“同治四年四月，国瑞奏言，四月二十六日据亲王僧格林沁家人富克精阿等飞驰到济泣诉，二十四日，该亲王在曹州城西之高楼集地方追及贼踪，……，该逆瞥见我军，即列仗迎拒，此次该逆自汶上县之袁路口过河，窜至郓城西北水套一带，勾结郓北伏莽，聚集马步数万，势甚凶猛，经僧格林沁督军击退，复率马步进追，不期伏贼尽出，我军被贼围裹，该亲王督令马队冲突，始将败残马步各队带扎荒庄，复被该逆层层包裹，僧格林沁于夜间率领马步冲突贼围，该逆大股追袭，行至距曹州府西十余里，该亲王力竭阵亡，……等语。……，上命军机大臣，……，曰，此股贼匪，虽系穷寇，内有牛老洪张总愚陈大?宋景诗赖文光等著名贼酋，凶狡异常”。〔一六〕又说：“同治二年，宋景诗易装南遁，与皖捻合。四年三月，捻由考城定陶窜曹州东北，宋景诗率马贼二千，声言回堂邑，直边皆警。四月，僧王追贼曹州，中伏薨。捻酋牛老洪张总愚陈大?赖文光宋景诗等麇集水套，结郓城土匪，马步十余万，自曹州北至濮范，东至巨野嘉祥，西至东明定陶，蔓延数百里，河北大震”。〔一七〕这些史料，一方面足以作为宋景诗投向捻军联成一体的证据，一方面却说明了革命部队的强大。注：
