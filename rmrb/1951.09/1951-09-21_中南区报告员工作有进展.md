The Central South Region has established 8,577 reporters. Party committees above the level of the CCP prefectural committees in various regions have established reporter systems. Party committees above the county level in provinces such as Henan, Hunan, and Hubei, as well as many district committees, have also established reporter systems. The majority of these reporters are CCP party secretaries and committee members at various levels, as well as party cadres holding leading positions in party organs, people's governments, people's organizations, and major industrial and mining enterprises. They have generally given reports on major political issues such as resisting America and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries in factories, schools, and rural areas. The reporter work in various regions has been warmly welcomed by the people. The workers of the Shenxin Textile Factory in Wuhan City jumped for joy when they heard that the mayor of the city, Wu Defeng, was coming to give a report.

In order to strengthen the planning of reporter work and to regularize it, the CCP Party committees in some regions have gradually established and improved the reporter work system. For example, the Wuhan City Committee, the Hunan and Henan Provincial Committees, the Luoyang City Committee of Henan, and the Chenliu Prefectural Committee have stipulated that reporters must give a report to the masses once a month, and have established a system of regular contact between reporters and propagandists and party committees, as well as a system for reporters to report to the party committees regularly. In addition to the party committee members giving reports to the urban and rural people every month, the Juye Prefectural Committee of Hubei also arranged for the office reporters to go to the countryside to give reports on Sundays. These reporters first understood the ideological situation of the masses and cadres when they went to the countryside, and then filled out cards to report to the prefectural committee after the report. The Luohe City Committee holds a reporter meeting once a month, at which they summarize the experience of the reporter work and formulate a plan for future work. After implementing this system, the reporter work in the city has gradually become regularized.

    中南区报告员工作有进展
    中南区已设立报告员八千五百七十七名。各地中共地委级以上的党委都已设立报告员，河南、湖南、湖北等省县委级以上的党委和许多地区的区委也都设立了报告员。这些报告员大部分是中共各级党委书记和委员与在党的机关、人民政府、人民团体和各主要工矿企业中担任领导工作的党员干部。他们普遍地在工厂、学校和农村中作了有关抗美援朝和镇压反革命等重大政治问题的报告。各地的报告员工作受到人民群众热烈的欢迎。武汉市申新纱厂的工人们听到该市市长吴德峰要来作报告的消息，都高兴得跳起来。
    为了加强报告员工作的计划性和使报告员工作经常化，有些地区的中共党委已逐渐建立和健全了报告员工作制度。如武汉市、湖南、河南省委、河南洛阳市委、陈留地委等都规定报告员每月必须向群众作一次报告，并建立了报告员与宣传员和党委经常联系以及报告员定期向党委汇报等制度。湖北大冶地委除党委委员每月向城乡人民群众作报告外，机关报告员并利用星期日下乡作报告。这些报告员下乡时先了解群众和干部的思想情况，报告后并填写卡片向地委汇报。漯河市委每月开报告员会议一次，会上总结报告员工作经验并订出以后的工作计划。执行这一制度后，该市报告员工作已经逐渐经常化。
