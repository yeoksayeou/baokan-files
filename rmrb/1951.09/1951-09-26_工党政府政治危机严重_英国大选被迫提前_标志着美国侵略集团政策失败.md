Xinhua News Agency, London, 25th: British Prime Minister Attlee announced on the 19th that Britain would hold parliamentary elections on October 25th. This fact indicates that the British ruling group, as a result of pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparation which has created a serious economic crisis at home, has fallen into a serious political crisis.

The Labour government's decision to hold a general election is a reluctant and risky one. The last British general election was held on February 23, 1950. According to the British constitution, the next general election can be held after the current government has been in power for five years. At the same time, given the current Labour government's war policy causing widespread public resentment, the Labour Party is unlikely to win the election. The Labour government had to make this decision because it feared that if things continued to develop, it would lose its majority in Parliament, where it holds only a five-vote majority, and be forced to step down, and from then on collapse. Therefore, it had to plan, before this irreversible situation occurred, a desperate struggle, seeking a fluke of hope, to improve its position and prolong its rule.

What the Labour government fears most is that if it delays holding the general election, the unprecedentedly severe economic crisis that is expected to arrive this winter will surely bring it down. Reuter pointed out: "Labour's top authorities believe that if they wait any longer, they will definitely fail. Now Labour hopes to escape the popular discontent and anger that will inevitably be caused by coal shortages, electricity shortages, rising prices, the burden of the arms expansion plan on ordinary people, and direct conflicts with trade unions over wage issues after this winter." British newspapers also discussed Labour's plan without any concealment. The "Yorkshire Post" commented: "Attlee's decision to ask the people for a public judgment before Christmas is very meaningful. A decisive factor in his calculations is undoubtedly the dark economic future."

Another thing the Labour government fears is that if it delays holding the general election, then the split within the Labour Party that is expected to occur at the Labour Party conference will be unavoidable, and the Labour Party's current rule will surely collapse. On the agenda of this annual meeting, scheduled to be held in Scarborough from October 1st, hundreds of proposals have strongly protested against the Labour Party's right-wing leadership. Fierce quarrels are inevitable at the meeting. Labour leaders are now trying to use the decision to hold elections in October as an excuse to "unite against external enemies" to stop criticism and resistance from the party masses, and to force party members to take unified action in the campaign. This can temporarily preserve the ruling position of the right-wing leaders within the Labour Party. Agence France-Presse revealed: Attlee's action will "stabilize" the opposition within the Labour Party in order to work together to win votes.

The Labour government's risky election strategy to achieve its goals has opened up an opportunity for Churchill's Conservative Party to come to power. The Conservative Party is now gleefully preparing to take advantage of the British people's serious dissatisfaction with the Labour Party to return to power. However, it is very clear that the failure of the Labour government is precisely the failure of the entire British ruling group's policy. Whether the Labour Party or the Conservative Party comes to power, it cannot change this fate. The British Communist Party issued a statement on the 19th, pointing out to the British people that "the real issue of the election is to fight for peace and save Britain." The British Communist Party has decided to participate in the election in twenty-three constituencies across the country. It calls on all patriots and peace-loving people to vote for the Communist Party candidates.

    工党政府政治危机严重
    英国大选被迫提前
    标志着美国侵略集团政策失败
    【新华社二十五日讯】伦敦消息：英国首相艾德礼于十九日宣布英国定于十月二十五日举行议会选举。这一事实表明，英国统治集团由于奉行扩军备战政策而在国内造成严重经济危机的结果，已使自己陷入了严重的政治危机。
    工党政府关于举行大选的决定，是一个迫不得已而冒险的决定。本来，英国上届大选是一九五○年二月二十三日举行的。按照英国宪法，下届大选可以在现政府执政满五年以后举行，同时，在目前工党政府实行战争政策致使民怨沸腾的情况下，工党要在大选中获胜的把握是不大的。工党政府之所以不得不作出这个决定，是因为害怕事态发展下去，它会在只占五票多数的议会内失去多数而被迫下台，并且从此一蹶不振。因此，它不得不打算在这种无可挽回的情况发生以前，作一次拚命的挣扎，寻求万一的希望，来改善自己的地位，延长自己的统治。
    工党政府首先害怕的是：如果延不举行大选，那末眼看今冬就要到来的空前严重的经济危机将一定使它垮台。电通社指出：“工党最高当局认为，假如再等待到以后的话，它就一定要失败。现在工党希望逃过今冬以后由于煤荒、电荒，物价不断上涨，扩军计划加于普通人民的负担，以及与工会在工资问题上的直接冲突所必然引起的人民的不满与愤怒。”英国报纸对工党的这种打算也毫不掩饰地予以谈论。“约克郡邮报”就评论说：“艾德礼决定在圣诞节前请国民公断，是很有意义的。他的计算中的一个决定性因素，无疑地是黑暗的经济前途。”
    工党政府害怕的另一件事情是：如果延不举行大选，那末眼看要在工党年会上发生的工党内部分裂就会无法避免，工党目前的统治就会一定垮台。在这个定于十月一日起在斯卡巴罗举行的年会的议程上，已有数百件提案对工党右翼领导机构提出了强烈的抗议。会上要发生剧烈的争吵是必然的。工党头子们现在就企图利用十月举行大选的决定藉口“团结对外”，来制止党内群众的批评和反抗，并强迫党员在竞选中采取一致的行动。这就可以暂时保全右翼领袖们在工党内的统治地位。法新社透露：艾德礼的这一行动会使工党党内的反对派“安定下来”，以共同努力争取选票。
    工党政府这种冒险以图一逞的选举策略，给邱吉尔的保守党开辟了一个上台的机会。保守党现在正在兴高采烈地准备利用英国人民对工党的严重不满而重新执政。然而十分明显，工党政府的失败正是整个英国统治集团政策的失败，不论是工党还是保守党上台都决不能改变这种命运。英国共产党已于十九日发表声明，向英国人民指出“选举的真正问题是为争取和平与拯救英国而斗争”。英共已决定将在全国二十三个选区参加竞选。它号召全体爱国者和爱好和平的人们投共产党候选人的票。
