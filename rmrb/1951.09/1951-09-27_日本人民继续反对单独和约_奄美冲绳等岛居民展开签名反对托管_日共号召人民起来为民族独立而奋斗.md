Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: According to TASS on September 25th, many Japanese civic organizations, labor unions, and political groups continue to oppose the separate peace treaty with Japan pushed by the US and Britain, and the so-called US-Japan "Security Treaty" which implies the establishment of a US-Japan aggressive bloc.

According to "Gouwa News," the Patriotic Movement Council for Overall Peace issued a statement emphasizing that the Japanese delegation attending the San Francisco conference did not express the wishes of the Japanese nation, and the treaty signed is not in accordance with international agreements. The statement said: We believe that this illegal and unjust treaty is invalid, and we demand the signing of an overall peace treaty with Japan based on the unanimous agreement of the four major powers that can restore Japan's independence, withdraw foreign troops, and guarantee Japan's security.

One thousand one hundred students recently held a meeting at the New System University in Tokyo, unanimously passing a resolution denouncing the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the expansion of armaments, and calling for intensified collection of signatures demanding the signing of an overall peace treaty and a peace pact.

The Tokyo branch of the All-Japan Metalworkers' Union passed a resolution to fight for the unity of the workers' peace defense front and to oppose the Diet's ratification of the separate "peace treaty" with Japan.

The Central Executive Committee of the All-Japan National Railway Workers' Union, influenced by the Socialist Party, decided to support the struggle launched by the Japan National Peace Promotion Council against the ratification of the separate "treaty."

Xinhua News Agency: Tokyo News: Residents of Amami Oshima and Okinawa Island in Japan are resolutely opposed to the United States' conspiracy to annex them under the guise of "trusteeship."

On July 21st, residents of Amami Oshima held a rally, and the conference telegraphed the Japanese Communist Party, requesting that the tragic will of the island's more than 200,000 residents be conveyed to the 80 million Japanese people. The telegram said: "We, the more than 200,000 people of Amami Oshima, resolutely oppose trusteeship, which will destroy the nation and enslave the people."

The Japanese Communist Party immediately replied, expressing its support. The reply stated: We have informed the people of the whole country about your struggle, and called on them to rise up and resolutely oppose Yoshida's traitorous peace policy and fight for national independence.

Through this rally, the workers and farmers of Amami Oshima have united. From August 1st, people in Naze City and various towns and villages on the island held hunger strikes for 24 to 48 hours respectively. On August 6th, cinemas, restaurants, and other shops held a 24-hour strike. Now, 99 percent of the island's residents over the age of 14 have participated in the signature campaign to promote the return movement.

Okinawa Island is also launching a signature campaign against trusteeship. In the Kunigami District of the island, 74 percent of the people had signed by July 1st.

   【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社二十五日讯：日本的许多民众团体、工会和政治团体继续反对美英单独对日和约和意味着建立美日侵略集团的所谓美日“安全条约”。
    据“媾和新闻”报道，全面媾和爱国运动协议会发表声明强调说：参加旧金山会议的日本代表团没有表达日本民族的愿望，签订的和约不合于国际协定。声明说：我们认为这个非法的不公正的条约是无效的，我们要求签订能够在四大国一致同意的基础上恢复日本的独立、撤退外国军队和保障日本安全的全面对日和约。
    一千一百个学生顷在东京新制大学举行会议，一致通过决议，斥责美日“安全条约”和扩充军备，呼吁加紧征集要求签订全面和约与和平公约的签名。
    全日金属工人工会东京分会通过决议，为争取工人保卫和平阵线的团结、为反对国会批准单独对日“和约”而斗争。
    社会党影响下的全日国营铁道工人工会中央执行委员会，决定支持日本推进和平国民会议发动的反对批准单独“和约”的斗争。
    【新华社讯】东京消息：日本奄美大岛、冲绳岛的居民，坚决反对美国在“托管”名义下的吞并阴谋。
    七月二十一日，奄美大岛的居民举行奋起大会，大会致电日本共产党，要求把全岛二十余万居民的悲愤意志，传达给八千万日本人民。电报说：“我们奄美大岛二十余万人民坚决反对灭亡民族、以人民为奴隶的托管。”
    日共当即复电表示支援。复电说：我们已将你们斗争的情形告知全国人民，并号召他们起来坚决反对吉田的卖国媾和政策，为民族独立而奋斗。
    通过这次奋起大会，奄美大岛的工人和农民业已团结起来。从八月一日起，该岛名濑市及各村镇的人民分别举行了二十四小时至四十八小时的绝食。八月六日，电影院、饭馆以及其他商店举行了二十四小时的罢市。现在，全岛十四岁以上的居民中，百分之九十九都参加了促进归还运动签名。
    冲绳岛也在展开反对托管的签名运动。该岛国头郡到七月一日止，已有百分之七十四的人民签了名。
