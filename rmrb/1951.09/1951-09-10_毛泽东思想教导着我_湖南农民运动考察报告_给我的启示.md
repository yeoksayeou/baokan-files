Mao Zedong Thought Guides Me
——Inspirations from "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan"
Liu Qing

Editor's Note: Comrade Liu Qing is the author of the novels "Record of Grain Planting" and "Copper Wall and Iron Bastion" (the latter of which is about to be published). This article truthfully records his process of integrating with the peasant masses and his understanding of Mao Zedong Thought in his creative practice. This is beneficial to readers.

The Party Constitution, revised and adopted by the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, clearly stipulates in its General Program that Mao Zedong Thought serves as the guide for all our Party's work. In the section "On the Question of the Party's Guiding Ideology" in his "Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution," Comrade Liu Shaoqi succinctly and pertinently expounded the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary cause of our Party and people, and then said: "...It is the duty of every Party member to follow the instructions of Mao Zedong Thought in carrying out work." Mao Zedong Thought, the doctrine of the Chinese revolution developed and created on the theoretical basis of Marxism-Leninism, is multifaceted, encompassing everything from politics, economics, and military affairs to literature and art. But Mao Zedong Thought is by no means empty theory; it is integrated with the practice of the Chinese revolution. "Knowledge begins with practice, and theoretical knowledge is acquired through practice, and then it is necessary to return to practice." (Mao Zedong: "On Practice") This is an important principle of Mao Zedong Thought. We know that Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly and enthusiastically admonished us in speeches and articles to proceed from reality; to look downwards; to be students of the masses; never to be detached from the masses for a moment; to become one with the people; and to take conformity with the greatest interests of the broad masses of the people as the highest standard... These instructions are universally applicable to every comrade engaged in Party work, government work, military work, or literary and artistic work. Facts have proved that whoever carefully understands and earnestly implements Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, no matter what kind of work they do, will become a person who is energetic, promising, and useful to the revolution; those who do not earnestly implement or even violate these instructions will not do their work very well or will do it very badly.

For literary and artistic workers from petty-bourgeois origins, it is first necessary to transform their thoughts and feelings through integration with the worker-peasant-soldier masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art":

"To completely solve this problem, it will take ten or eight years of a long time. But no matter how long the time is, we must solve it, and we must solve it clearly and thoroughly. Our literary and artistic workers must complete this task, must move their buttocks over, and must gradually move over to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the process of going deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, going deep into actual struggles, and studying Marxism-Leninism and studying society. Only in this way can we have truly literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" solved many of my problems in literary and artistic thought, while his outstanding work "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," with its distinct and enthusiastic class viewpoint, educated me and encouraged me even more during the most painful period of my ideological struggle for self-transformation, giving me sufficient reason and will to resolutely transform myself. This great document also vividly and concretely solved a most fundamental problem for me, which is the problem of class viewpoint (standpoint) and the problem of thoughts and feelings expressed in works.

The main significance of "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" in the Chinese revolutionary struggle lies in the fact that it was the first to put forward a correct revolutionary line with the most eloquent and vivid facts, in order to oppose the erroneous capitulationist line of Chen Duxiu and others. I now only want to talk about the education I have received from this document within the scope of literary and artistic work.

Before I went to the countryside in the spring of 1943 to do actual work in a serious and concrete way, I had always thought that I was "very revolutionary." At that time, I had three burdens on my shoulders: one was that I came from the peasant class, and my class background was good; another was that I joined the Party relatively early, and my history was pure; and the third was that the short stories I wrote before the rectification movement had no problems, and regardless of whether they were well written or not, they always praised the revolution and the people. All these burdens, coupled with the fact that I had never gone deep into actual struggles and had not "gone through a long and even painful tempering" as Comrade Mao Zedong said, prevented me from correctly understanding myself and my work, and my thinking stagnated seriously for a period of time. I thought that my class viewpoint was already very clear, and therefore the thoughts and feelings expressed in my works were already "integrated with the thoughts and feelings of the worker-peasant-soldier masses." This complacency made me greatly neglect ideological cultivation and eagerly demand to create something.

When the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art was held in Yan'an in 1942, I was in Suide. During the stage of studying documents in the Yan'an rectification movement, I participated in the township election in Mizhi. In the township election, I was a dispensable person, because I was not busy with publicizing the election, registering voters, and inspecting the work, but was taking the opportunity to collect materials - talking to people and "observing" life. After the township election work was over, what formed in my mind was a "long" subject matter about the peasants' rent reduction and tenancy protection struggle. I returned to Yan'an in the autumn, and my purpose was to start implementing this "creative plan" that I had in my belly but had not announced to anyone; while the rectification study in the organs had just entered the stage of examining thoughts, the organization decided that I should participate in branch work. It is conceivable what kind of incorrect emotions I had at that time. I didn't say it, but I thought in my heart: "You have all written articles with ideological problems, but I haven't. The problem that happened to me, like the one that happened to you in the past, is giving me time to write." In just one or two months, without any actual contact with the masses, I wanted to write artistic works that reflected class struggle. Not to mention that nearly ten years have passed now, even after a year of truly contacting reality, I already knew that this was ridiculous; but I couldn't get over this hurdle at the time. In February 1943, after the ideological stage of rectification study ended, the Central Organization Department transferred me to the countryside first from our literary group. In fact, I was not happy at the time. The problem was not solved ideologically, but I obeyed the organization in terms of organization. Even when I arrived in Mizhi, I was still thinking about teaching in a middle school there for a period of time, finishing the planned things, and then going to the countryside. It was only because the English teacher in the school had already been found, and the Chinese teacher was too busy and dissatisfied, that I gave up this step. Now that I think about it, that was such a stubborn idea of not proceeding from reality!

Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech at the May Fourth Youth Festival in Yan'an in 1939: "What is the criterion for judging whether a young person is revolutionary? What can be used to distinguish him? There is only one criterion, and that is to see whether he is willing to, and actually does, unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants." According to this standard, it is very clear that I am at least not thoroughly revolutionary. Then why did I, when I was a teenager who couldn't even recognize all the characters, gnaw on the "Communist Manifesto," participate in the national salvation movement around the "December 9th" Incident, and cough up blood from exhaustion in running publications after the Xi'an Incident, and then go to the enemy's rear to join the army and go to the front line to fight in 1939? There is also a revolutionary component in this, but the biggest component is personal ambition, and I always didn't want to be an insignificant person. Aren't it rare for petty-bourgeois intellectuals to come to the revolutionary ranks with purely personal aspirations? I say this shows that I am indeed not very "great," but this is the truth, and concealing this fact is hypocrisy. Unfortunately, I did not understand the profundity of Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the time, and did not think that I was unwilling to and did not practice uniting with the worker-peasant masses; my understanding of this was forced by reality.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the first paragraph of "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" after pointing out the great momentum of the peasant movement: "All revolutionary parties and revolutionary comrades will be tested by them and decide whether to abandon them. Stand at the head of them and lead them? Or stand behind them and criticize them? Or stand opposite them and oppose them?" That's exactly right. Although my "comradely contempt for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and detachment from the masses, is somewhat different from the Kuomintang's contempt for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and detachment from the masses" ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"); but when I was a township clerk in a township government in Mizhi County, I was indeed subjected to this kind of test.

From 1938 when I arrived in Yan'an to this time when I went to the countryside as a township clerk, I always ate, dressed, and roamed around in the name of a literary and artistic worker. When I went to actual struggles, I watched others work. In the army, I was a guest who came and went quickly. In the countryside, I stood by with my hands in my pockets and watched the masses hold meetings. It was no longer possible when I became a township clerk. In addition to completing the various tasks assigned by the Party and the government at higher levels, I often dragged a stick to deal with dogs and ran to various villages. The common people came to me for letters of introduction, road permits, quarrels and fights, methods of planting cotton, and even whether a sore on a baby's head could be treated. As soon as I took office, reality seriously raised this question to me: "Let's see if you can do it?" At the same time, since arriving in Yan'an, I had always been one of the people who were treated preferentially in life. In general difficult situations, people like us are always better off. It was no longer possible when I became a township clerk. In the first half year in the countryside, I ate hardships that I had never eaten in my life. I didn't know how to cook. The township head received food rations and had to take care of his family. I had to eat with him. He only had three *qing* [unit of area] of his own land, more than ten *qing* of rented land, and supported a family of five or six people. He himself was separated from production, and life was very hard. Every day it was sorghum rice, *qianqian* rice (black beans pressed to the size of hemp coins and mixed with millet to make porridge), yams, bran fried noodles, and dried cabbage. Such food, coupled with frequent movement in various villages, often holding Party branch meetings and group meetings all night long, and it was not something that could be completed in ten and a half months or even three or two months, life was indeed unbearable. In this regard, reality also seriously raised the same question to me: "Let's see if you can do it?"

I knew that whether I could do it or not would have a significant impact on my future development. Obviously, the question before me at this time was not just whether to engage in literary and art or not, but more importantly, whether to be revolutionary or not. I had never paid attention to this question since I participated in the revolution, or thought that it was not a problem, but now it became a serious problem. I clearly felt that the problem was only in one point: Did I have feelings for the worker-peasant masses? This feeling arises from a correct class viewpoint. This viewpoint makes a person first have a strong revolutionary demand, rather than a personal creative demand. That is to say: First of all, it depends on whether I think it is painful when the masses think it is painful, and whether I feel happy when the masses feel happy. If so, then I can do it, and I can endure material difficulties; if not, then I will not be able to do it subjectively or objectively. If I am not happy, they don't need me either, so creation as one of the revolutionary work is out of the question. There is no room for compulsion or pretense in this. I wanted to insist on doing it. Generally speaking, I am a strong person, and I also have a bit of resilience to complete my ambitions; but if a person does not have a noble ideal of serving the people fully, and only has personal plans, he will eventually try to get around difficulties and get rid of pain, and it will not last long just by gritting his teeth and enduring.

Reality forced me to read Marxist-Leninist books. I was able to finish reading five volumes of Stalin's Selected Works that summer, paying special attention to those speeches on Party work and rural issues, which shows that I was eager to strengthen ideological cultivation to persevere. These books were very kind to me at the time in my living and working conditions, so they had a great impact on me. I also read "Les Misérables" by the 18th-century French Romantic writer Hugo. This is a book describing the good and evil of laborers and exploiters. Although there is utopian thought in Hugo's works, Jean Valjean's life spirit also had an impact on me. Because I knew that the protagonist was an early Christian believer, and no matter how shallow I was, I was a Marxist believer, and the starting points of the two for the feelings for the working people and serving them wholeheartedly were completely different. In addition, what I was pursuing was clear, so it had no negative effect on me and did not lead me into fantasy. In this year, I read Comrade Mao Zedong's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" (only the first part of the publicly published one now), which was printed and distributed by the Party Central Committee as an internal Party document. It immediately gave me a very profound ideological education and encouraged my revolutionary enthusiasm.

As Comrade Chen Boda said: "In this article, the facts are reflected so vividly, the enthusiasm is expressed so exuberantly, every sentence, down to every word, is permeated with infinite joy for the revolution and the working people, and irreconcilable hatred for the counter-revolutionaries and the man-eating exploiters." I found that Comrade Mao Zedong was the earliest and best model of "uniting with the worker-peasant masses" both in action and in thoughts and feelings. His report is both a political document and a work of art. I have never seen such an enthusiastic and unreserved praise for the working people in any literary work. It is difficult to extract any prominent paragraph as an example, because Comrade Mao Zedong's noblest thoughts and feelings run through every word of the full text. Only then did I know the meaning of what we often say that Comrade Mao Zedong is a great leader of the people. This outstanding leader who combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution spoke from the standpoint of the people from beginning to end. Others said that the peasant movement in Hunan was "terrible," the gentlemen in the city were in an uproar, and people in Changsha were talking about it in the streets. Even the very "revolutionary" people could not completely deny the word "terrible"; Comrade Mao Zedong denied it and said it was "very good."

Comrade Mao Zedong wrote:

"If you are a person who has determined a revolutionary point of view, and have run to the countryside to see it once, you will definitely feel an unprecedented pleasure."

Comrade Mao Zedong is exactly like this. He happily praised the people, praising those who others called "rascals" as revolutionary pioneers, overturning the feudal rule of thousands of years in a few months. Based on this point of view, Comrade Mao Zedong completely integrated his thoughts and feelings with the thoughts and feelings of the working people.

Starting from this revolutionary point of view, Comrade Mao Zedong, with the genius of Marxist-Leninist methodology, put forward the permanent line for the Chinese revolutionary struggle as early as 1927 - from the masses, to the masses; properly estimated the role of the peasant force in the Chinese revolution - the vanguard of overthrowing the feudal forces, "the meritorious officials who have achieved the revolutionary cause that has not been achieved for many years"; concretely portrayed the face of revolutionary democratic dictatorship - the peasant association dictates everything in the countryside, which is really "what can be said can be done."... Comrade Mao Zedong's arguments have been tested by the actual revolution at all stages, and are still truth today. "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" will always be one of the precious classics in the treasure house of Mao Zedong Thought.

I read this document again and again in the countryside at that time. I realized that I not only did not understand how to be a revolutionary literary and artistic worker in the past, but in fact, I didn't understand revolution at all. As I read the document, Comrade Mao Zedong's great image floated in my mind. He seemed to be asking me: "Comrade, can't you work with these masses?" I was extremely ashamed. The unhealthy feeling of being "exiled" when I first arrived at the township government gradually disappeared. I understood a little bit of the meaning of the work I was doing: learning from the masses, concentrating the opinions of the masses, and turning around to lead the masses, thereby exercising myself. Having understood this, I became stronger and more active. I also gained a little revolutionary quality of smiling in difficulties. Due to the hardship of material life, I fell ill. One of my farming brothers came to see me. Seeing me lying on the small *yao* [cave dwelling] kang [brick bed] of a poor peasant, which was full of things, he felt quite pity and asked me to go home to recuperate. I found it ridiculous and refused. The county party secretary said that if I felt I couldn't support myself, I could go back to the county party committee to work for a period of time, but I didn't listen to him either. Because of the call of Mao Zedong Thought, I felt ashamed to do so. After autumn, my township took the lead in launching the rent reduction struggle. In winter, it was a mass anti-traitor struggle like raging fire. Similar situations to those praised in Comrade Mao Zedong's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" also appeared in our township. In these struggles, I learned many things from the rural party members and cadres and the mass activists, and had a deeper layer of feelings with each other. After that, I not only didn't want to go back to Yan'an, but I also missed the affairs of the township very much when I had meetings in the county for a long time. I was no longer ashamed to walk on the street with the rural cadres on my back, and I no longer felt that someone was laughing at me. Isn't this a change in thoughts and feelings? Only because of this change could I work in the rural government for three years with peace of mind without feeling that the time was long; and after the outbreak of the war in northern Shaanxi in 1947, I couldn't stay in Dalian, where life was comfortable, and I didn't hesitate to trek thousands of miles back to northern Shaanxi, and I went to the countryside for another year and a half without feeling any difficulty.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" when talking about the change in thoughts and feelings: "Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be incompatible." He said in an article "Commemorating the May Fourth Movement" written in 1939: "If intellectuals do not combine with the worker-peasant masses, they will accomplish nothing." Indeed, it is unimaginable that I can write two novels with a little content today without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. There are other reasons why my works cannot better meet the requirements of the Party and the people. For example, my Marxist-Leninist cultivation and the literary cultivation of the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation are not enough, etc., I will not talk about them here. I just want to talk about the fact that I recently reread "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," which made me have a deeper understanding of the standpoint, viewpoint, and thoughts and feelings expressed in my works.

Comrade Mao Zedong fully described the magnificence of the peasant movement in this document, and specifically listed fourteen major events, for the purpose of advocating what and opposing what. We write literary works in the same way. We call it theme. But when Comrade Mao Zedong advocated and opposed something, he always did it completely for the masses, without showing himself at all. Therefore, he was full of enthusiasm in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," showing that his thoughts and feelings were integrated with the thoughts and feelings of the working people. And some of our literary and artistic workers, including myself, often want to show ourselves more or less. We often impose our own thoughts and feelings that are different from those of the working people on the characters we describe. In the parts of the work that are unrelated to the working people but are liked by ourselves, we are always unwilling to abandon them when describing the characters' personalities and scenes, and even consciously pay attention to them. My novel "Record of Grain Planting" has many such traces. Although there are fewer situations where I impose thoughts and feelings different from those of the working people on my characters, that kind of description reveals that I have a certain degree of appreciation for my characters and their lives; rather than as Comrade Chen Boda said, "permeated with infinite joy for the revolution and the working people, and irreconcilable hatred for the counter-revolutionaries and the man-eating exploiters." My praise, condemnation, and flogging in that novel are all limited. I was too infatuated with the outdated old realism's character portrayal and scene description, but it made the work not gain enough strength. A comrade whom I respected once said to me: "What the Party and the people demand from you, a communist writer who has some life experience, is more than what you gave in 'Record of Grain Planting'." This criticism made me sad when I read that novel. On this point, I made the greatest effort in the new novel "Copper Wall and Iron Bastion" and made some improvements; but I can't say that I have completely changed and don't need to work hard anymore.

What measures a writer's standpoint, viewpoint, and thoughts and feelings is his works, or more precisely, the correctness and profundity of his works' reflection of reality; rather than his bragging about how deeply he has gone into the masses, how integrated he is with the masses, and even not hesitating to say that he has always been like this. Writing is effortless. It is very possible for a writer to write bad works after writing some better works. This is something that we should deeply alert ourselves to. To avoid this, we need to continue to be more closely connected with the masses, rather than becoming famous with the help of the masses and then becoming detached from them. Those who think that it is enough to be combined with the masses for a while to be useful for a lifetime are very dangerous ideas. A well-cultivated writer is very mature in all aspects of actual life, Marxism-Leninism, and literary cultivation. Such a writer can write radiant works. But a writer may be temporarily inferior in the latter two aspects. As long as he always considers his responsibility to the working people, does not regard the literary career as a personal career, and does not break contact with the working people, he may not have stagnation and regression, and gradually move towards maturity.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in his classic philosophical work "On Practice":

"Our practice proves that we cannot immediately understand what we feel, and only what we understand can we feel more deeply. Feeling only solves the problem of phenomena, and theory only solves the problem of essence. The solution of these problems cannot be separated from practice at all. Whoever wants to know something cannot solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing."

I think that if a writer wants to carry out creative activities with the correct class viewpoint and thoughts and feelings, there is no other shortcut except to follow the path designated by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Let us move forward under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 毛泽东思想教导着我——“湖南农民运动考察报告”给我的启示

专栏：

    毛泽东思想教导着我
    ——“湖南农民运动考察报告”给我的启示
    柳青
    编者按：柳青同志是长篇小说“种谷记”和“铜墙铁壁”（后者即将出版）的作者。他的这篇文章，真实地记述了他和农民群众结合过程和在创作实践中对于毛泽东思想的体会。这对于读者是有益的。
    中国共产党第七次全国代表大会修改通过的党章，在总纲里明确规定以毛泽东思想作为我们党的一切工作的指针。刘少奇同志在“关于修改党章的报告”中“关于党的指导思想问题”一段里，扼要而中肯地阐述了毛泽东思想对我们党和人民的革命事业的伟大意义以后，说：“……遵循毛泽东思想的指示去进行工作，乃是每一个党员的职责。”毛泽东思想，在马克思列宁主义的理论基础上发展和创造起来的关于中国革命的学说是多方面的，从政治、经济、军事到文学艺术无所不包的。但毛泽东思想绝不是空谈的理论，它是和中国革命实践结合为一体的。“认识从实践始，经过实践得到了理论的认识，还须再回到实践去。”（毛泽东：“实践论”）这就是毛泽东思想的一个重要原则。我们知道，毛泽东同志一次又一次地在演说和文章里充满热情地告诫我们要从实际出发；要眼睛向下；要当群众的学生；要一刻也不脱离群众；要和人民打成一片；要以合乎广大人民群众的最大利益为最高标准……。这些指示对于无论进行党的工作、政权工作、军事工作或文艺工作的每个同志，都是普遍适用的。事实证明：不管做哪一样工作，凡是细心领会和切实执行毛泽东同志这个指示的人，就会成为一个有生气、有出息、对革命有用的人；不切实执行甚至违反了这个指示的，工作就会做得不很好或者很糟糕。
    对于小资产阶级出身的文艺工作者来说，还必须首先通过与工农兵大众的结合，来改造自己的思想感情。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”里说：
    “要澈底解决这个问题，非有十年八年的长时间不可。但是时间无论怎样长，我们却必须解决它，必须明确地澈底地解决它。我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把屁股移过来，一定要在深入工农兵、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马列主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺。”
    毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”解决了我的许多文艺思想上的问题，而他的出色的阶级观点分明而又热情充沛的著作“湖南农民运动考察报告”，更在我自我改造的思想斗争最痛苦的时候，教育了我，鼓舞了我，使我有了足够的理智和意志坚决地改造自己。这个伟大文献还生动具体地给我解决了一个最基本的问题，这就是阶级观点（立场）问题和表现在作品里的思想感情的问题。
    “湖南农民运动考察报告”在中国革命斗争中的主要意义，是在于它最早地以最雄辩的生动事实提出了正确的革命的路线，以反对陈独秀等错误的投降的路线。我现在仅仅是想就文艺工作的范畴，来谈谈我从这个文献里受到的教育。
    在一九四三年春天我认真确实地下农村做实际工作以前，我一直认为自己是“很革命”的。那时有三个包袱压在我身上：一个是我出身农民阶级，成份好；另一个是我入党的时间比较早，历史纯洁；第三个是我在整风以前所写的短篇小说都没有问题，不管写的好坏，总是歌颂革命，歌颂人民的。所有这些包袱，加上我从未深入实际斗争，没有像毛泽东同志所说的“经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练”，使我不能正确地认识自己和自己的工作，有一个时期思想上发生了严重的停滞。我自以为我的阶级观点已经十分明确，因而表现在我的作品里的思想感情也已经“与工农兵大众的思想感情打成一片”了。这种自满情绪使我大大地忽视了思想修养，而急于求成地要求创作。
    一九四二年延安召开文艺座谈会时，我在绥德。延安整风运动中学文件的阶段，我在米脂参加乡选。在乡选中，我是一个可有可无的人，因为我忙的不是宣传选举、登记选民和检查工作，而是借机搜集材料——找人谈话，“观察”生活。乡选工作结束以后，我的脑子里形成的却是一本关于农民减租保佃斗争的“长篇”的题材。秋天我回到延安，目的就是要着手实行这个装在肚里不曾向人宣布的“创作计划”；而机关里的整风学习刚进入检查思想的阶段，组织上却决定我参加支部工作。可以想像我当时有怎样一种不正确的情绪，嘴上不说，心里却想：“你们都写过思想有问题的文章，我没有。在我身上发生的问题像过去对你们一样，是给我时间让我写作。”短短一两个月工夫，并不和群众发 生实际的接触，只靠耳闻笔记的材料，就想写出反映阶级斗争的艺术作品，不说现在过了相近十年，就是过了一年我真正接触实际以后，也已经知道这是可笑的了；但我当时的确扭不过这个弯来。一九四三年二月，整风学习的思想阶段结束以后，中央组织部从我们那个文学团体里，头一个就调我下乡。实在说，当时我是不高兴的。思想上没有解决问题，只是在组织上服从了。直至到了米脂还想着在那里的一个中学里教一时期的书，写完计划中的东西再下乡。只因学校的英文教员早就有了，国文教员太忙，不称心，才放弃了这一步。现在想起来，那是多么顽固的不从实际出发的想法啊！
    毛泽东同志一九三九年在延安五四青年节的演讲里说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么作标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意，并且实行不实行同广大的工农群众结合在一块。”根据这个标准来衡量，很显然我至少是不澈底革命的。那么我在十几岁时连字也不全认识就啃“共产党宣言”，“一二九”前后参加救亡运动，西安事变后为办刊物累得大口咳血，一九三九年又到敌后跟部队上前线去打仗，这都是为什么呢？这里面也有为革命的成份，但极大的成份是个人的抱负，总不愿意做一个无声无息的人。难道小资产阶级知识分子带着纯粹个人的志愿到革命队伍里来还是少见的吗？我这样说显得我的确很不“伟大”，但这却是事实，掩饰这个事实就是虚伪。可惜的是我当时并不理解毛泽东同志这个演讲的深刻性，不认为自己是不愿和不实行与工农群众结合的；我理解这一点是被现实逼迫的。
    毛泽东同志在“湖南农民运动考察报告”的第一段里指出了农民运动的浩大声势以后，就说：“一切革命的党派、革命的同志，都将在他们面前受到他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？”正是这样。虽然我这个“同志的轻视工农兵，脱离群众，与国民党的轻视工农兵，脱离群众，是有些不同的”（“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）；但我在米脂县一个乡政府里当乡文书，的确正是受了这种检验。
    从一九三八年到延安至这次下乡当乡文书中间的几年里，我总是以一个文艺工作者的名义吃饭穿衣和游来游去。我到实际斗争中去是看别人工作，在部队里是马上来马上去的客人，在农村里是把两手插在裤袋里站在旁边看群众开会。当了乡文书就不行了。我除了要完成上级党和政府交付的各项任务，经常拖着一根对付狗的棒子到各村奔波之外，老百姓关于写介绍信，割路条，吵嘴打架，种棉花的方法，以至于娃娃头上长了一个疮能否疗治，都来找我。我一到职，现实就严重地向我提出这个问题：“看你搞下去搞不下去？”同时自到延安以来，我在生活上一向是受优待的一种人。在一般的困难情况下，我们这种人总要好些。当了乡文书也不行了。我在乡下的头半年吃了有生以来未吃过的苦，自己不会做饭，乡长领得口粮要兼顾家庭，我只好在他家附食。他只有三垧自己的地，十多垧租种地，养活着一家五六口人，自己又脱离了生产，生活是很苦的，见天是高粱饭，钱钱饭（黑豆压得像麻钱一样大小和小米混合起来做的稀饭），山药蛋，糠炒面和干白菜。这样的伙食加上经常在各村流动，黑夜常常通宵开党的支部会和小组会，而且又不是十天半月以至三月两月可以完结，生活的确是够受的。这方面，现实也严重地向我提出了同一个问题：“看你搞下去搞不下去？”
    我知道搞下去或搞不下去对我往后发展的影响是重大的。很明显，这时摆在我面前的问题不仅仅是搞文艺不搞文艺的问题，而更重要的是革命不革命的问题了。这个问题自我参加革命以来都未曾重视过，或者认为这是不成问题的，现在成了严重的问题。我清楚地感觉到问题只在一点：我和工农群众有没有感情？这种感情产生于正确的阶级观点。这种观点使一个人首先发生强烈的革命的要求，而不是个人的创作要求。这就是说：首先要看群众以为痛苦的，我是不是以为痛苦，群众觉得愉快的，我是不是觉得愉快。如果是，那就能搞下去，就能忍受物质的困难；如果不是，那就无论主观上和客观上都搞不下去。我不痛快，他们也不需要我，这样子作为革命工作之一的创作也就谈不到了。这中间丝毫没有勉强和做假的余地。我是要坚持搞下去的，我一般地说是个要强的人，还有点完成自己志愿的韧性；可是一个人如果没有充分为人民服务的高尚理想，而只有个人打算的话，他终要设法绕过困难，摆脱痛苦的，单凭咬住牙忍受是不长久的。
    现实强迫我读起了马列主义的书籍。我能在这年夏天读完五本斯大林选集，特别注意那些关于党的工作和农村问题的演说，可见我是急于加强思想修养来坚持搞下去的。这些书籍在我当时的生活和工作的情况下，是非常亲切的，所以它们对我有不小影响。我也读了十八世纪法国浪漫主义作家雨果的“悲惨世界”。这是一本描写劳动者与剥削者的善与恶的书。虽然雨果的作品里有乌托邦思想，但约翰·法尔约翰的生活精神对我也有影响。因为我清楚主人翁是早期的基督教信徒，我自己无论如何浅薄，总算是马克思主义信徒，二者对劳动人民的感情和全心全意服务的出发点截然不同，加上我追求的东西是明确的，它对我并无消极作用，并未将我引入幻想中。正在这一年，我读到党中央按党内文件印发下来的毛泽东同志的“湖南农民运动考察报告”（只是现在公开发表的前一部分），它立刻给我极深刻的思想教育，并鼓舞了我的革命热情。
    正如陈伯达同志所说：“在这篇文章里，事实反映得这样生动，热情表现得这样洋溢，每个句子，直到每个字，都浸透着对于革命和劳动人民之无限量的欢喜，对于反革命和吃人的剥削者之不可调和的仇恨。”我发现毛泽东同志无论在行动上和思想感情上，都是“同工农群众结合在一块”的最早的与最好的典范。他的这个报告又是政治文件，又是艺术作品。我还不曾从任何文学著作中看见过对劳动人民这样热情的无保留的歌颂，要从其中引出任何突出的一段做例子都是困难的，因为毛泽东同志的最高贵的思想感情贯穿到全文的每一个字句。我这才知道我们常说毛泽东同志是伟大的人民领袖的意义。这位使马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命的实际相结合的杰出领袖，是自始至终站在人民的立场上讲话的。别人说湖南农民运动“糟得很”，城里的绅士大哗，长沙各方面的人街谈巷议，即使是很“革命”的人也无法完全否认这“糟”字；毛泽东同志否认它，说是“好得很”。
    毛泽东同志写道：
    “你若是一个确定了革命观点的人，而且是跑到乡村里去看过一遍的，你必定觉到一种从来未有的痛快。”
    毛泽东同志正是这样。他痛快地歌颂人民，把别人说成“痞子”的歌颂为革命先锋，几千年的封建统治，给他们几个月工夫打翻了。基于这个观点，毛泽东同志使自己的思想感情和劳动人民的思想感情完全打成一片了。
    从这个革命观点出发，毛泽东同志天才地以符合马列主义的思想方法论，早在一九二七年就为中国革命斗争提出了永久不变的路线——从群众中来到群众中去；恰当地估计了农民力量对中国革命的作用——打倒封建势力的先锋，“成就那多年未曾成就的革命大业的元勋”；具体地刻划了革命的民主专政的面貌——农会在乡村里独裁一切，真是“说得出，做得到”。……毛泽东同志的这些论点经过各个阶段革命实际的检验，到如今还是真理，“湖南农民运动考察报告”将永远是毛泽东思想宝库中的珍贵经典之一。
    我那时在乡村里一读再读这个文件。我省悟到我过去不仅不懂得怎样做一个革命的文艺工作者，而且实在说不懂得革命哩。我读着文件，脑子里就浮起毛泽东同志伟大的影像。他好像在问我：“同志，你和这些群众在一块搞不下去吗？”我惭愧极了。我初到乡政府时那种“被放逐”的不健康感觉逐渐消失了。我明白了我正在从事的工作的一点意义：向群众学习，集中群众的意见，反转来领导群众，从而锻炼自己。明白了这点，我变得坚强起来，活跃起来了。我也获得了一点在困难中微笑的革命品质。由于物质生活的困苦，我病了一场。我的一个种地的哥哥来看我，见我躺在一个贫农塞满东西的小窑炕上，颇为怜悯，要我回家去休养，我认为可笑而拒绝了。县委书记说我如果觉得支持不下去，可以回县委工作一时期再说，我也没有听他。由于毛泽东思想的感召，我感到那样做是羞耻的。秋后我的乡上首先发动了减租斗争，冬天是如火如荼的群众性的反奸斗争，我们那个乡里也出现了类似毛泽东同志“湖南农民运动考察报告”中所歌颂的情况。在这些斗争中，我向乡村党员干部以及群众积极分子学习了许多东西，互相间有了深一层的感情。此后我不仅不想回延安，而且在县里开会日子久了，都很惦念乡上的事。我背着铺盖和农村干部一块在街上走不脸红了，再不觉得有人在笑话我了。这难道不是思想感情起了变化吗？只因这一变化，我才能安安心心在乡村政权里工作了三年，而不觉得时间长；并且在一九四七年陕北战事爆发后，我在生活舒适的大连待不住，不惜跋涉万里回陕北去，下农村又搞个一年半载，而不觉得有什么困难。
    毛泽东同志在“延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”里谈到思想感情的变化时说：“没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”他在一九三九年写的一篇“纪念五四”的文章里说过：“知识分子如果不与工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”的的确确，我到今天能够写出两本稍微有一点点内容的长篇小说来，没有毛泽东思想的教导是不可想像的。我的作品不能更好地满足党和人民的要求，那还有其他原因。譬如马列主义修养和中国民族的优良传统的文学修养不够等等，我就不在这里说了。我只想再说说最近我重读“湖南农民运动考察报告”，使我对表现在作品里的立场观点和思想感情，有了比较深一层的认识。
    毛泽东同志在这个文件里尽情描写农民运动的雄伟壮阔，具体举出十四件大事，是为了主张什么和反对什么。我们写文艺作品也是这样。我们把它叫做主题。但是毛泽东同志主张和反对什么的时候，他总是完全为了群众，丝毫不表现自己。所以他在“湖南农民运动考察报告”里热情澎湃，表现得和劳动人民的思想感情相融无间。而我们有些文艺工作者包括我自己在内，常常或多或少地要表现自己。我们常常把我们自己有别于劳动人民的思想感情强加到我们所描写的人物身上，在作品中与劳动人民无关而为我们自己所喜爱的部分，在描写人物性格与场面时总是不愿割弃，甚至有意识地加以重视。我的小说“种谷记”就有不少这样的痕迹，虽然把有别于劳动人民的思想感情强加到我的人物的情况较少，但是那种描写手法显露出我有一定程度的欣赏我的人物和他们的生活之嫌；而不是像陈伯达同志所说的，“浸透着对于革命和劳动人民之无限量的欢喜，对于反革命和吃人的剥削者之不可调和的仇恨。”我在那本小说里的歌颂、谴责和鞭挞，都是有限量的。我太醉心于早已过时的旧现实主义的人物刻画和场面描写，反而使作品没有获得足够的力量。我所尊敬的一个同志曾经对我说：“党和人民向你这个有了一些生活经验的共产党员作家要求的，比你在‘种谷记’里所给的要更多。”这个批评使我读起那本小说就难过。在这一点上。我在新的小说“铜墙铁壁”里作了最大的努力，有了一些改进；但也不能说我已经澈底改好了，不需要再努力了。
    衡量一个作家的立场观点、思想感情的是他的作品，更确切地说，是他的作品反映现实的正确性和深刻性；而不是他嘴里吹嘘自己如何深入群众，如何与群众打成一片，甚至不惜说自己是一向如此的。写作是毫不费力的。一个作家很可能在写了一些较好的作品以后，又写出坏作品来，这是值得我们深深警惕自己的；要避免这个，就需要我们继续更加紧密地联系群众，而不是借群众成了名，就脱离了他们。那些以为曾经结合过一时群众就够一辈子受用的想法，是很危险的。一个修养完备的作家是在实际生活、马列主义和文学修养各方面都很成熟的。这样的作家可以写出光芒四射的作品。但是一个作家可能后二者暂时较差，只要他时刻考虑自己对劳动人民的责任心，不要把文学事业当做个人事业，不要断了和劳动人民的联系，他就有可能不发生停滞和倒退的现象，而逐渐走向成熟。
    毛泽东同志在他的经典的哲学著作“实践论”里说：
    “我们的实践证明：感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。感觉只解决现象问题，理论才解决本质问题。这些问题的解决，一点也不能离开实践。无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”
    我以为作家要以正确的阶级观点与思想感情进行创作活动，除了走毛泽东同志所指定的这条路，再没有其他任何捷径。
    让我们在毛泽东思想的光芒照耀下前进吧。
