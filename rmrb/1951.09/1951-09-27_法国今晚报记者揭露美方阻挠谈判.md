Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: French newspaper "La Tribune des Nations" reporter Pierre Béguin reported from Kaesong on September 26th: The Korean and Chinese side has once again made efforts to salvage the dangerous situation of the Kaesong armistice negotiations caused by the US side. The liaison officer of the Korean and Chinese side handed over a request from the Korean and Chinese side to the liaison officer of Ridgway, asking them to reply to the suggestion to hold a formal meeting of representatives from both sides at 10:00 this morning. This notice was handed over to the other party at Panmunjom at 7:00. This is a simple and straightforward proposal to restore the negotiations without any conditions. If Ridgway does not have time to send a meeting representative to Kaesong today, he can send a liaison officer at 9:00 to determine the date and time of the meeting. Kenny's note last night said that the Korean and Chinese side unilaterally interrupted yesterday's negotiations, and US news agencies said that Colonel Zhang Chunshan "strode out" of the meeting, all of which are completely fabricated. In fact, the meeting records show that Kenny had already proposed an adjournment before Colonel Zhang Chunshan made a new proposal, asking that his proposal to hold a meeting today be conveyed to Joye. The last words at the meeting were Kenny's words "agreed" - agreeing to adjourn the meeting. The note submitted by Colonel Zhang Chunshan this morning once again made Kenny's propaganda a sail without wind, with no room for him to play tricks.

The tricks the US is currently playing in Kaesong are still the old tricks that people are familiar with. This set of tricks once undermined the Allied Control Council for Germany, the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference. The brutal method of sabotaging meetings with bombing and assassination has now been replaced by this method. This is to drown the real problem in a sea of ​​meaningless nonsense, and to replace the real problem with trivial issues. In fact, the meeting could have started at 10:00 this morning, and it could have quickly settled down to remove the obstacles that have been hindering the glorious ceasefire in Korea.

    法国今晚报记者揭露美方阻挠谈判
    【新华社二十六日讯】法国今晚报记者贝却敌二十六日自开城报道：朝中方面再次努力拯救美方所造成的开城停战谈判的危险局势，朝中方面的联络官将朝中方面的一个要求交给了李奇微的联络官，要他们答复今晨十时举行双方代表正式会议的建议，这个通知已于七时在板门店交给了对方。这是一个使谈判无任何条件地恢复的简明而直率的建议。如果李奇微今天来不及派会议代表来开城，他可以在九时派联络官来确定会议的日期与时间。肯尼昨晚的照会说朝中方面片面地中断了昨天的谈判，美方通讯社说张春山上校“昂然退出了”会议，这些都是彻头彻尾的虚构。事实上，会议的纪录说明了在张春山上校提出新的建议，要求把他提出的在今天开会的提议转达乔埃以前，肯尼实际上即已提议休会。会上最后的一句话是肯尼说的“同意”二字——同意休会。张春山上校今晨提出的照会再一次使肯尼的宣传成了无风之帆，无可施其伎俩了。
    美方目前在开城玩的手段还是人们所熟悉的那老一套，这一套手段曾破坏了盟国对德管制委员会、外长会议和外长助理会议。用轰炸与暗杀来破坏会议的那种残暴的办法，现在被这种办法来代替了。这是要把真正的问题淹没在无意义的胡言乱语的大海里，是要以枝节问题代替真正的问题。而事实上会议本可以在今晨十时开始，而且可以迅速安定下来清除那些一直阻碍着朝鲜光荣停火的障碍。
