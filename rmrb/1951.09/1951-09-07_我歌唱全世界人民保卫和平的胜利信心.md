    I Sing of the World's People's Victorious Confidence in Defending Peace
    Qu Xixian

    "The Hearts of People All Over the World are One," winning second prize in the song competition at the Third World Youth Festival, fills me with immense excitement and glory!

    This song was composed at the end of 1949 and the beginning of 1950.

    1949 was an incredibly exciting year. I personally witnessed the liberation of Beijing and the birth of the People's Republic of China. The dark, decaying, and bloody reactionary rule was shattered by the iron fists of the people! Everything was fresh, bright, and joyful! My heart was overflowing with the feeling: Victory! Victory! We have won! Before liberation, my understanding of revolutionary optimism was "even with our deaths, we conquer death," but today, I have come to understand a new meaning, and new images have appeared before me: the People's Liberation Army marching into Beijing, singing, advancing, their faces glowing with red light; the colorful mass scenes of red flags waving during the entry ceremony; the solemn voice of Chairman Mao announcing the founding of the People's Republic of China at Tiananmen Square... Victory was so concrete, so vivid, so powerful! I love my new country. I am proud to be Chinese. I feel so honored that the new China has joined the powerful world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union! The joyful and enthusiastic emotions soaring in the melody of "The Hearts of People All Over the World are One" come from here. This is not just my emotion, but the universal, joyful, and upward emotion among the vast masses of people who have just been liberated.

    Let me talk about where the lyrics came from. The most difficult thing for a composer is finding good lyrics. A good poem is not necessarily a good song lyric. However, lyrics are of decisive importance to a song. Therefore, in addition to searching hard, composers also have to put in effort to revise and organize the found lyrics, so that they are suitable for composition in terms of content and form. The lyrics of "The Hearts of People All Over the World are One" also went through this process. The original poem was three or four times longer. In order to make it short and easy to sing, I deleted the parts that could be deleted. In addition to revising and organizing, I also added two lines: "Strive for people's democracy, strive for lasting peace." I believe that without this addition, although the lyrics were still quite good in terms of atmosphere, imagery, and emotion, they still lacked a clear political content. What is the specific content of our internationalism? On what political basis are the people of the world united? I thought it should be clearly pointed out: "Strive for people's democracy, strive for lasting peace."

    Shortly after this song was written, it began to become popular among students and cadres in Tianjin through the introduction of the Central Conservatory of Music. Later, it was also sung in some factories. It is said that the worker brothers especially like to sing the line "Mao Zedong Stalin." Yes, how wonderful it is to sing these two beloved names, these two names that centrally embody the glory of the struggle for peace and democracy, together! Moreover, the melody probably conveys the people's deep love for their leaders, so the worker comrades also like to sing it. Gaining their love is the supreme reward for my work. In the spring of 1950, a comrade who participated in the Spring Festival rural publicity told me that they had introduced this song to the farmers in that township, and the farmers also liked it very much. How happy I was!

    With the increasing importance of the new China in the world peace camp, with the surging tide of the great patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, with the rapid advancement of the political awakening of the broad masses, and with the increasing development of new music work, this victorious, combative song, full of internationalist spirit, has been welcomed by many people, and has even been sung in some minority areas. What makes me particularly excited is that the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, standing at the forefront of defending world peace, are also singing like this: "The victorious banner flutters... The hearts of people all over the world are one!"

    A mass song must live in the singing of the masses, otherwise it has no life; moreover, after being sung by workers, peasants, and soldiers, it seems that its life miraculously radiates new brilliance.

    It is an honor to contribute to the cause of world peace. Our entire Chinese nation is the most glorious warrior in the peace camp. If there were no victorious struggles of peace-loving people all over the world, if there were no great contributions of the Chinese people to the cause of peace, such a song would not have been possible. Only in the era of Mao Zedong, in the liberated new China, could such an optimistic and combative melody appear. The people have already created this song in their thoughts and feelings. I have only used notes to give these thoughts and feelings wings.

    There is nothing happier than being a Mao Zedong's literary and artistic fighter. He points us in the correct and eternally victorious direction. Comrades Nie Er and Xian Xinghai have already paved the way on the music front, and the diligent efforts of countless musicians have created many good works. Our mass songs have been developing and growing under the revolutionary tradition, advancing under the slogan of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    This song is only a small flower among the fresh flowers cultivated in our people's musical soil. It itself is still immature and imperfect. With the strong and magnificent advancing pace of our nation, more and more beautiful flowers will bloom on the avenue of new music. "We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." Chairman Mao's words will always encourage us to move towards victory, literary and artistic fighters: We must realize this great prophecy! (Attached picture)

### 我歌唱全世界人民保卫和平的胜利信心

    我歌唱全世界人民保卫和平的胜利信心
    瞿希贤
    “全世界人民心一条”这首歌曲获得了第三届世界青年联欢节歌曲比赛二等奖，我感到无比的兴奋和光荣！
    这首歌曲是在一九四九年末至一九五○年初谱成的。
    一九四九年是太令人兴奋的一年。我亲眼看见了北京的解放，亲眼看见了中华人民共和国的诞生。阴暗的、腐朽的、血腥的反动统治被人民的铁拳粉碎了！一切都是新鲜的、明亮的、令人喜悦的！心里充溢着的感觉是：胜利了！胜利了！我们胜利了！解放前，我所理解的革命乐观主义是“甚至用我们的死，我们也征服了死”，但是今天，我却体会到一种新的意义，我眼前出现了新的形象：那是刚进北京城的，高唱着，前进着，脸上放着红光的人民解放军队伍；那是入城典礼中红旗飞舞，彩色缤纷的群众场面；那是天安门上毛主席宣告中华人民共和国成立的庄严的声音……胜利是那样的具体，那样的生动，那样的有力！我爱我的新国家。我感到自己是一个中国人而骄傲。我感到了新中国从此列入强大的以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，是多么光荣呵！“全世界人民心一条”曲调中飞扬着的愉快热烈的情绪是从这里来的。这不仅是我一个人的情绪，这是刚获得解放的广大人民中普遍的，欢快的，向上的情绪。
    我来谈谈歌词是怎么来的。作曲者最苦的是找不到好歌词。一首好诗，也不一定就是一首好歌词。然而歌词对歌曲却有决定性的重要。因此作曲者在苦苦寻找之余还不得不对找到的词下一番修改整理的功夫，使它在内容上形式上适合于谱曲。“全世界人民心一条”这首歌词也经过了这个过程。原诗有三四倍长，为了简短易唱，我把它删去了可以删去的部分。除了修改整理外，还加上了两句：“争取人民民主，争取持久和平。”我认为如果没有这增添，这首词虽然在气氛上、形象上、情绪上都还相当好，但是还缺乏一个明确的政治内容。我们的国际主义的具体内容是什么呢？全世界人民在什么政治基础上团结一心呢？我想应该明确地指出：“争取人民民主，争取持久和平。”
    这首歌曲写出后不久，经过中央音乐学院的介绍就在天津的学生、干部中开始流行。后来，部分工厂中也唱起来了。据说工人弟兄们特别喜欢唱“毛泽东斯大林”这一句。是啊，把这两个亲爱的名字，这两个集中地体现了和平民主斗争的光辉的名字，放在一起歌唱是多么好！而且这曲调大概还相当能传达出人民对领袖的挚爱吧，因此工人同志们还喜欢唱。获得他们的喜爱是我的工作的无上报酬。一九五○年春，有一位参加春节下乡宣传的同志告诉我，他们曾把这首歌介绍给那个乡里的农民，农民们也很喜欢。我是多么高兴啊！
    随着新中国在世界和平阵营中重要性的日益增长，随着伟大的抗美援朝爱国运动的汹涌澎湃，随着广大群众政治觉醒的突飞猛进，也随着新音乐工作的日益开展，这胜利的、战斗的、满怀着国际主义精神的歌曲获得了不少人的欢迎，甚至在一部分少数民族地区也唱起来了。而使我特别感到兴奋的是站在保卫世界和平最前线的，朝鲜战场上的中国人民志愿军也这样唱着：“胜利的旗帜哗啦啦的飘……全世界人民心一条！”
    群众歌曲一定要活在群众的歌声中，否则它是没有生命的；而且，经过工农兵一唱，好像它的生命竟神奇地放出新的光彩来了。
    能在世界和平事业中尽一分力量是光荣的。我们整个中华民族就是和平阵营中最光荣的战士，假如没有全世界爱好和平人民的胜利斗争，假如没有我们中国人民对和平事业的伟大贡献，这样内容的歌曲是不可能产生的。也只有在毛泽东的时代，在解放了的新中国，才会出现这样乐观的、战斗的旋律。人民已经在思想感情上创造了这歌曲，我只是用音符使这种思想感情长上翅膀。
    最幸福的莫过于做一个毛泽东的文艺战士，他指给我们正确的、永远胜利的方向。在音乐战线上聂耳、冼星海同志已经开辟了道路，无数音乐工作者的勤劳努力已经创造出了不少好的作品。我们的群众歌曲一直在革命的传统下发展成长，在与工农兵结合、为工农兵服务的口号下，向前迈进。
    这首歌曲只是我们人民音乐土壤中培养出来的鲜花中的小小的一朵。它本身还是幼稚的，不够完美的。随着我们民族壮健雄美的前进的步伐，新音乐的大路上将开放出更多的，更美好的花朵来。“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”毛主席的话永远鼓励着我们走向胜利，文艺战士们：我们要实现这伟大的预言！（附图片）
