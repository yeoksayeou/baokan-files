    Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Education and Department of Finance
    Inspecting the Unreasonable Wage Payment Practices for Primary School Teachers
    Editor:
    After the People's Daily published an article on June 12 regarding the unreasonable wage payment practices for primary school teachers in Hebei Province, we conducted an in-depth inspection. This problem does indeed exist in our province. Last year, due to the reduction of agricultural tax surcharges, the local grain revenue in most counties was insufficient, resulting in a general reduction of teachers' salaries by about 20 jin. Moreover, the supply was not timely, with instances of salary arrears or the issuance of old or spoiled grain. Therefore, last autumn, after consultation between the Department of Culture and Education and the Department of Finance, it was initially clarified that educational funding should be a priority for local grain expenditure, used according to the needs of educational work, without being limited to the 60% ratio. Various counties also conducted inspections and rectifications of educational funding to avoid waste and unreasonable expenditures. At the Provincial Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education last November, it was proposed to solve the problems of excessively low teacher salaries in some areas, the inability to pay salaries on time, and the cost of transporting grain. It was also decided to subsidize teachers living more than 200 li away from home with travel expenses twice a year. In November of last year and April of this year, notices were issued twice to various localities to ensure the quality of grain issued to teachers, with financially wealthy prefectures and counties uniformly implementing the financial grain price and reasonable regulations for grain conversion rates. At a local finance conference convened by the Department of Finance and the Department of Culture and Education in January of this year, it was also clearly pointed out that cultural and educational funding should be given the highest priority in local finances, with appropriately increasing teachers' salaries as the focus, and standards for teacher compensation and some welfare issues were stipulated. On April 1st, a formal order (Cai Zi No. 54) was issued to the entire province for implementation in April. To reward teachers for working in mountainous areas with peace of mind and to take care of teachers' living difficulties, it was stipulated that their original salaries should be appropriately increased (Cai Jiao Zi No. 4 notice on April 25th). After these problems were gradually resolved, teachers' morale gradually stabilized, and educational work developed (with 1,472 new primary schools, 5,596 teachers, and 250,000 students). However, due to the conservative views of some financial cadres, who neither studied and implemented the superior's notices nor requested instructions or reported, the instructions were not carried out, affecting the work.
    In order to further solve this problem, after consultation with the Department of Finance, the Department of Culture and Education, and the Provincial Education Trade Union, the prefectural commissioner's offices were instructed to conduct inspections of this problem and offer criticisms. Regarding salary payment, it is planned that starting in July, the entire province will uniformly issue payments based on the financial grain price. Those who can implement this should report to the province for record-keeping; those who have difficulties in implementation should consult with the financial section, the culture and education section, and the trade union to propose solutions, which should be reported to the province for approval before changes can be implemented. At the same time, a thorough understanding of local financial revenues and expenditures and the situation of wage payments will be conducted. On June 29th, the Department of Finance, the Department of Culture and Education, and the Provincial Education Trade Union, together with relevant departments of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, inspected the specific situation of wage payments in Shulu County. Inspections will be carried out in each district in the future.

### 河北省文教厅及财政厅检查小学教师薪资折发不合理的现象

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    河北省文教厅及财政厅
    检查小学教师薪资折发不合理的现象编辑同志：
    六月十二日人民日报发表了关于河北省小学教师薪资折发不合理问题后，我们曾进行了深入检查。这个问题在我省确实存在。去年农业税附加减征，多数县份地方粮入不敷出，因之教师薪资曾一般降低二十斤左右，且供给不及时，甚至有欠薪，或发陈米、坏米等现象。因此于去年秋季，经文教、财政两厅协商，初步明确教育经费为地方粮开支重点，根据教育工作情况使用，不拘限于百分之六十的比例数；各县对教育经费亦曾进行了检查、整顿，避免浪费及不合理开支。去年十一月全省工农教育会议上提出解决部分地区教师薪资太低、不能按时发薪及领粮运费等问题，并决定家在二百里以外的教师全年补助回家路费两次。去年十一月和今年四月并曾两次通报各地保证发给教师粮食的质量，地方财政富裕的专区、县统一执行财政米价，发粮折合率的合理规定等。今年一月财政、文教两厅召开地方财政会议时，又明确指出地方财政中文教经费占第一位，其中又以适当提高教师待遇为重点，并规定教师待遇标准及部分福利问题。四月一日又以财字五十四号明令全省于四月间实行。为奖励教师安心在山区工作，照顾教师生活困难，规定在原薪上再适当提高（四月二十五日财教字四号通报）。这些问题逐步解决后，教师情绪逐渐稳定，教育工作曾有发展（新增小学一四七二处，教员五五九六人，学生二十五万人），但因部分财政干部存在财政保守观点，对上级通报既不研究执行，又不请示报告，致使指示落空，影响了工作。
    为了进一步解决这个问题，经财政、文教厅及省教育工会协商，指示各专署，对这一问题进行检查并提出批评。在发薪问题上拟于七月份开始，全省一律按财政米价发款，能执行者报省备案，执行有困难者经财政科、文教科、工会等部门协商，提出解决意见，报省批准后才能变更执行。同时，深入了解地方财政收支和折发薪资情况。六月二十九日财政、文教两厅及省教育工会曾协同石家庄专署有关部门检查了束鹿县折发薪资具体情况。今后将逐区进行检查。
