Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 15th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: After the U.S. side was forced to admit the crime of U.S. aircraft strafing the neutral zone on September 10th, it not only showed no remorse, but also continued to violate the neutral zone from the air and the ground, continuing to delay and obstruct the resumption of armistice negotiations.

According to reports from our military police force's aerial observation: U.S. military aircraft have continued to violate the airspace over the neutral zone in the past three days. According to incomplete statistics, there have been as many as eighty-eight sorties: twenty-nine sorties on September 12th, twenty-one sorties on the 13th, and thirty-eight sorties by 6 PM on the 14th.

At the same time, South Korean troops in T'orah-san, outside the Kaesong southeastern neutral zone, have invaded the vicinity of P'anmunjom in the neutral zone four times: at approximately 2:00 PM on the 12th, more than thirty people sneaked into Kijong-dong, penetrating about one kilometer into the neutral zone; at approximately 8:00 PM on the same day, some members of the unit fired more than thirty rounds at the neutral zone with machine guns and automatic rifles; at 8:30 AM on the 13th, some members of the unit again fired at us with automatic rifles and carbines, penetrating about one kilometer into the neutral zone; at approximately 10:00 PM on the same day, some members of the unit fired a signal flare first, followed by continuous firing at our side with machine guns and automatic rifles for up to twenty minutes, penetrating to near Paektong-ni and Kijong-dong, about one kilometer inside the neutral zone. The aforementioned area invaded by the South Korean troops is the same area where our platoon leader Yao Qingxiang was murdered on August 19th, and the aforementioned armed personnel invading the neutral zone can also be fully proven to be South Korean regular troops. According to Kim Bong-deuk, a member of the South Korean reconnaissance squad captured by our army on September 1st, the South Korean troops in T'orah-san, Bongdong-myeon, Kaepung-gun, are a reconnaissance squad of the Rhee Syngman puppet Ministry of National Defense. Moreover, Park Duk-ki, a member of the 1st detachment of the Intelligence Bureau of the Rhee Syngman puppet Ministry of National Defense, captured by our army on September 8th, further pointed out in his confession that the South Korean troops in T'orah-san are a reconnaissance squad of the 11th regiment of the Rhee puppet army's 1st division. The confessions of these two prisoners of war irrefutably prove that the armed personnel who have repeatedly invaded the vicinity of P'anmunjom in the Kaesong neutral zone all belong to the Rhee Syngman regular troops under the command of the United Nations Command.

People all over the world have realized that the series of provocative incidents deliberately created by the U.S. side shows that the U.S. side has no sincerity in the armistice negotiation conference. The U.S. side's arrogant attitude of categorically denying the incidents it deliberately created has even more clearly exposed the sinister and cunning features of the U.S. side. Judging from the U.S. side's actions in the past few days, the U.S. side's forced admission of the strafing incident on September 10th not only shows no remorse, but also attempts to play a new trick, that is, to lightly admit one incident while stubbornly denying a series of other premeditated incidents, and to find excuses for creating new provocative incidents. However, Li Qiwei's cunning policy was punctured by himself on September 11th. If he picks up this tattered hat again, he will not be able to cover up his ugly face.

### 李奇微被迫承认扫射罪行后竟无悔祸之意  美方仍不断侵犯中立区

    李奇微被迫承认扫射罪行后竟无悔祸之意
    美方仍不断侵犯中立区
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者报道：美方被迫承认九月十日美机扫射中立区的罪行以后，不但毫无悔祸之意，而且仍不断地从空中和地面侵犯中立区，继续拖延和阻挠停战谈判的恢复。
    据我方军事警察部队对空观察报告：美方军用飞机三日来仍不断侵犯中立区上空，据不完全统计，先后已达八十八架次：即九月十二日二十九架次，十三日二十一架次，十四日截至十八时止三十八架次。
    同时，在开城东南中立区外的都罗山里的南朝鲜部队，又四次侵犯中立区板门店附近：十二日十四时许，有三十余人窜至机井洞，侵入中立区一公里许；同日二十时许，该部部分人员以机关枪、自动步枪向中立区方向射击三十余发；十三日八时三十分，该部部分人员又以自动步枪和卡宾枪向我射击，并侵入中立区一公里许；同日二十二时许，该部部分人员首发信号枪弹一发，继以机关枪和自动步枪向我方断续发射达二十分钟，并侵至中立区内一公里许的白冬音里附近和机井洞两地。上述南朝鲜部队侵入地区即为八月十九日我姚庆祥排长被谋杀的地区，而上述侵入中立区的武装人员亦可充分证明为南朝鲜的正规部队。据九月一日被我军俘获的南朝鲜部队侦察队队员金凤得供称：开丰郡凤东面都罗山里的南朝鲜部队为李承晚伪国防部的侦察队，而在九月八日被我军俘获的李承晚伪国防部情报局第一支队队员朴德基的供词则更进一步指出都罗山里的南朝鲜部队为李伪军第一师第十一联队的侦察队。这两个俘虏的口供，无可置辩地证实了对方历次侵犯开城中立区板门店附近的武装人员，均为属于联合国军司令部统辖下的李承晚正规部队。
    全世界人民已经明白美方故意制造一连串挑衅事件，是表明了美方对停战谈判会议无诚意。美方对自己蓄意制造的事件所采取的矢口抵赖的蛮横态度，也更加清楚地暴露了美方阴险狡猾的狰狞面目。从这几天美方的行动来观察，美方被迫承认九月十日的扫射事件，不但无悔祸之意，而且企图玩弄一套新的手法，即轻描淡写地承认一桩事件，而顽固地抵赖其他一连串的预谋事件，并为制造新的挑衅事件寻找遁辞。然而李奇微的狡猾政策从九月十一日起就被他自己戳破了，他要是再拣起这顶破烂的帽子，就更遮盖不住他那副丑恶的嘴脸。
