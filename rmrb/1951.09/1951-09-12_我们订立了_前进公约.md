Volunteer Army Letter

    We Have Established a "Forward Pact"
    Editor:
    Please convey the wishes of all comrades in our guard squad to our compatriots at home! We have recently established a "Forward Pact" to answer the love and support of our compatriots with the resolute completion of the tasks given to us by the people of the motherland.
    We, the volunteer soldiers on the Korean front, were so happy to see from the newspapers that the people of the motherland are carrying out patriotic movements in full swing! The patriotic actions of the people of the motherland have given us great encouragement and education. One day, I read an article in the People's Daily by farmer representative Li Fuquan reporting "How I Formulated and Implemented the Family Patriotic Pact and Donation Plan." This article moved me very much. Comrade Li Fuquan expressed his love for the motherland in the article, reported how he formulated the family patriotic pact, how he repeatedly raised the conditions of his pact and donation plan, and how he increased production, to the point that he calculated how to add up his savings from many years of being a hired worker and this year's estimated income, and after deducting the necessary production costs and living expenses for this year, donate all of it to buy airplanes and cannons to support the Volunteer Army. I read this article to all the comrades in our guard squad. Everyone felt that thousands upon thousands of people in the motherland are doing this, they—the people of the motherland—have such a great determination for the cause of defending the motherland and defending world peace, and we, the volunteer soldiers at the forefront of resisting America and aiding Korea, should work even harder. Our entire squad held a discussion, and everyone agreed that we should also formulate a pact ourselves to respond to the people of the motherland. Our pact has been formulated, with a total of six articles, proposing specific conditions in terms of work, study, discipline, and unity. For example, in terms of work, we proposed: "... under no circumstances should we fail to resolutely complete the task..." As for study, we stipulated that each person should learn two characters every day, so as to be able to recognize, read, write, and use them. We feel that this pact is to promote everyone to move forward, so we named it the "Forward Pact." It is also stipulated that it should be checked once a week. All of our comrades are determined to fully implement our pact, strengthen our work, overcome our weaknesses, and strive for greater victories.

    我们订立了“前进公约”编辑同志：
    请把我们监护班全体同志的意愿告诉祖国同胞吧！我们最近订立了一个“前进公约”，要以坚决完成祖国人民给我们的任务来回答祖国同胞对我们的热爱和支援。
    我们在朝鲜前线的志愿军战士，从报纸上看到祖国人民正轰轰烈烈地开展爱国运动，心里多高兴啊！祖国人民的爱国行动，给了我们很大的鼓励和教育。有一天，我从人民日报上看到一篇农民代表李福全报告“我怎样订立和执行家庭爱国公约和捐献计划”的文章。这篇文章使我非常感动。李福全同志在文章里说出他对祖国的热爱，报告他怎样订立家庭爱国公约，怎样一次又一次地提高他的公约条件和捐献计划，又怎样增产，以至他又怎样计算把过去多年当雇工的积蓄和今年预计的收入加在一起，除去今年必需的生产费用和生活费用之外，全部献出来买飞机大炮支援志愿军。我把这篇文章念给我们监护班全体同志听了。大家都感到：祖国千千万万的人民都在这样做，他们——祖国人民——对保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的事业都有这样伟大的决心，我们身在抗美援朝最前线的志愿军战士，应当更加努力才对。我们全班同志进行了讨论，大家认为我们自己也要订立一个公约，以回答祖国人民。我们的公约订出来了，一共有六条，在工作、学习、遵守纪律、团结等方面都提出了具体的条件。例如在工作方面，我们提出：“……不论在什么情况下要坚决完成任务……”又如在学习方面，我们规定每人每天学两个字，作到会认、会念、会写、会用。我们觉得，这个公约是推动大家前进的，所以给它取名叫“前进公约”。并规定每星期检查
    一次。我们全体同志都下了决心，一定要把我们的公约全部实现，加强我们的工作，克服我们的弱点，争取更大的胜利。
