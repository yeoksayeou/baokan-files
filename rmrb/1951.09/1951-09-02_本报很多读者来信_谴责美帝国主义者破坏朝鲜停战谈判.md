    Many Readers Write to This Newspaper
    Condemning U.S. Imperialists for Undermining Korean Armistice Negotiations
    Editor's Note: The U.S. imperialists' serious provocative acts of bombing and strafing the Kaesong neutral zone and plotting to murder our delegation have aroused the anger of the broad masses of the people. As of August 26, fifty-one readers had written to this newspaper condemning the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to undermine peace and supporting the solemn protests of Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai. Five letters are selected below:
   (I) Comrade Editor:
    U.S. imperialism is constantly creating conspiratorial incidents to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations. The incident of the U.S.-Li bandit troops sneaking into the Kaesong neutral zone and killing our platoon leader Yao has not yet been resolved, and U.S. imperialism has again sent planes to bomb and strafe the residences of our representatives in the Kaesong neutral zone in an attempt to murder our representatives. This frenzied and inhuman act fully proves that U.S. imperialism has no sincerity for peace and is intolerable to anyone with humanity. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have gained rich experience in struggle and have seen through the tricks of the imperialist reactionaries. We sincerely seek peace through negotiations, and we also have the power to defend peace through combat. We fully support the solemn protests of Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai. U.S. imperialism must seriously deal with this provocative incident and give us a reasonable and satisfactory answer. Otherwise, the armistice negotiations cannot continue, and U.S. imperialism should be responsible for all consequences.

   (II) Comrade Editor:
    After seeing the news that U.S. imperialist planes bombed and strafed the Kaesong neutral zone and deliberately plotted to murder our delegation, I felt extremely indignant!
    U.S. imperialism has twice shot at Panmunjom and killed our peace fighter, Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang. Finally, it even attempted to murder our negotiating representatives. This is something we can never tolerate. This series of shameless and arrogant provocative actions by U.S. imperialism fully proves that it does not want peace but is actively preparing to expand its war of aggression. It regards the patience of the Chinese and Korean people in striving for peace as a sign of weakness. Now our side has lodged a serious protest and taken measures to announce the adjournment of the meeting, which is completely correct and in line with the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world.
    This shameful behavior of U.S. imperialism will never scare the Chinese and Korean people. The Chinese and Korean people have already dealt a severe blow to U.S. imperialism in the past year. If U.S. imperialism undermines the armistice negotiations, it will inevitably suffer an even more severe blow. The Chinese people will heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, do a good job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, support the front, and consolidate national defense. Smash all the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism!
                     A Unit of the Armored Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Cai Peng
    (III) Comrade Editor:
    The Korean armistice negotiations have been adjourned due to the U.S. imperialists' shameless bombing and strafing of the Kaesong neutral zone. To ensure the continuation of the negotiations, as pointed out in the reply of Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Ridgway: U.S. imperialism "must seriously and responsibly deal with this serious provocative incident."
    Since the Korean armistice negotiations began, U.S. imperialism has created a series of provocative incidents. This fully shows that U.S. imperialism has no sincerity for peace whatsoever. U.S. imperialism shamelessly prides itself on its naval and air force "superiority" and considers itself a "victor"; but the result of its naval and air "superiority" is nothing more than a disastrous defeat with more than 270,000 casualties. Volunteer soldier Li Qikun said well: "Does U.S. imperialism think we can be bullied? That is truly blind! If it does not want an armistice, we will smash it to pieces!" (See New China News Agency, Kaesong, 24th). This represents the will of all the Chinese people. In order to bring about the final victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea as soon as possible, and in order to defend world peace, all the Chinese people must do a good job in promoting the patriotic pact, increasing production and donations, and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and other tasks in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
                        Zhang Yangtian, Staff Member of the Beijing Eyeglasses Industry Association
   (IV) Comrade Editor:
    The bloodstains of U.S. imperialism killing our military police Yao Qingxiang have not yet dried, and it has brazenly sent planes to invade the Kaesong meeting site area to carry out bombing and strafing, attempting to murder our representatives. This wolfish, insidious, and unparalleled shameless act is truly intolerable!
    As everyone knows, this action of U.S. imperialism is a planned provocative action to undermine the negotiations. U.S. imperialism even used rogue-like language after the event, making slanderous accusations and attempting to cover up the truth and deceive the people of the world. It is truly shameless! However, the shameless deception and slander of U.S. imperialism cannot cover up the iron facts. From these facts, the people of the world can see more clearly the hideous face and insidious and shameless nature of U.S. imperialism; the people of the world can see more clearly: who is defending peace and who is launching a war of aggression. The people of the world will strengthen their struggle and give the aggressors a severe blow to defend world peace.
    We firmly support the protests of Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai. If U.S. imperialism continues to adopt a shameless and cunning attitude, it will be responsible for all serious consequences.
    Zhang Baofang Cao Peiyun Xing Shuzheng, Students of the Department of Economics, Shanxi University
   (V) Comrade Editor:
    When I saw the news in the newspaper that American planes bombed and strafed the Kaesong neutral zone, attempting to murder our representatives, I felt extremely indignant! Since the beginning of the Korean armistice negotiations, we have made many concessions in order to strive for peace. However, U.S. imperialism has always adopted deceptive, intimidating, and delaying tactics, plotting to undermine the negotiations and expand its war of aggression. Recently, immediately after shooting and killing our military police Yao Qingxiang, it bombed and strafed the Kaesong neutral zone. This series of shameless destructive acts has made us see the hideous face of U.S. imperialism more clearly.
    U.S. imperialism was forced to agree to negotiations under the pressure of the people of the world and under the blows of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies. Facts have proved that war-loving imperialists have no sincerity for peace. It regards the concessions made by the Chinese and Korean people in striving for peace as a sign of weakness and carries out open provocations. The patience of the Chinese and Korean people is limited. As General Deng Hua said at the memorial meeting for martyr Yao Qingxiang: "If we cannot win peace through negotiations, then we must win peace through the struggle against aggression." This represents the will of all the Chinese people. All the Chinese people must continue to deeply develop the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and prepare to give a severe blow to the aggressors who dare to launch a war.
                        Li Wei, Reader, Maojiawan, Chongwenmen Inner, Beijing

    本报很多读者来信
    谴责美帝国主义者破坏朝鲜停战谈判
    编者按：美帝国主义轰炸和扫射开城中立区，阴谋杀害我方代表团的严重挑衅行为，已经引起广大人民的愤怒。到八月二十六日为止，已经有五十一位读者给本报来信，谴责美帝国主义破坏和平的阴谋行动，拥护金日成、彭德怀两将军的严正抗议。现选载来信五封于后：
   （一）编辑同志：
    美帝国主义不断制造阴谋事件，破坏朝鲜停战谈判。美李匪军潜入开城中立区枪杀我姚排长的事件尚未解决，美帝国主义竟又派遣飞机对开城中立区我方代表的住所施行轰炸和扫射，企图杀害我方代表。这种丧心病狂、毫无人性的举动，十足地证明了美帝国主义没有和平诚意，并且是任何一个有人性的人所不能忍受的。中国人民在毛主席英明的领导下，已经取得了丰富的斗争经验，对帝国主义反动派的伎俩，已洞悉无遗。我们诚意地用谈判方式争取和平，我们也有力量用战斗的方式保卫和平。我们完全拥护金日成、彭德怀两将军的严正抗议。美帝国主义对这一挑衅事件，必须进行认真处理，并给我们合理满意的答复。否则，停战谈判就无法继续进行，一切后果应该由美帝国主义负责。

   （二）编辑同志：
    看到美帝国主义的飞机轰炸和扫射开城中立区、蓄意谋害我方代表团的消息后，我感到万分愤恨！
    美帝国主义两次射击板门店，并杀害了我方和平斗士姚庆祥排长，最后竟企图谋杀我方谈判代表，这是我们决不能容忍的。美帝国主义这一连串无耻狂妄的挑衅行动，充分地证明它是不愿和平、而是积极准备扩大侵略战争的。它把中朝人民为争取和平的忍耐当作一种示弱的行动。现在我方提出严重抗议，采取宣告停会的措施，是完全正确的，是符合全世界爱好和平的人民愿望的。
    美帝国主义这种可耻的行为，是决吓不倒中朝人民的。中朝人民在过去一年中已经给美帝国主义以严重的打击。如果美帝国主义破坏停战谈判，它必定要受到更严重的打击。中国人民百倍提高警惕，做好抗美援朝工作，支援前线，巩固国防。粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋！
                     中国人民解放军装甲兵某部  蔡蓬
    （三）编辑同志：
    朝鲜停战谈判已因美帝国主义无耻轰炸、扫射开城中立区而停会了。要保证谈判的继续进行，正如金日成、彭德怀两将军给李奇微的答复中指出的：美帝国主义“必须认真负责地处理这一严重的挑衅事件”。
    自从朝鲜停战谈判以来，美帝国主义制造了一连串的挑衅事件。这充分说明美帝国主义是丝毫没有和平诚意的。美帝国主义腼然以海空军“优势”自豪，以“战胜者”自居；但它海空“优势”所得的结果，不过是伤亡二十七万人以上的惨败而已。志愿军战士李其坤说得好：“美帝国主义以为我们可欺吗？那真是瞎眼了！他不愿意停战，我们就把他打得粉碎！”（见新华社开城二十四日电）这代表了我们全中国人民的意志。全中国人民为了提早抗美援朝最后胜利的来临，为了保卫世界和平，一定要做好推行爱国公约、增产捐献和优待烈属军属等抗美援朝工作。

   （四）编辑同志：
    美帝国主义杀害我方军事警察姚庆祥排长的血迹未干，竟又派遣飞机侵入开城会址区施行轰炸、扫射，妄图谋杀我方代表。这种狼心狗肺、阴险绝世的无耻行动，真令人不能容忍！
    尽人皆知，美帝国主义这种行动是有计划地破坏谈判的挑衅行动。美帝国主义在事后竟反以流氓口吻，血口喷人，妄图掩盖事实真像，欺骗全世界人民，真是无耻极了！但是，美帝国主义的无耻的欺骗和诬蔑，遮盖不住铁的事实。全世界人民从这些事实中，更看清楚了美帝国主义的狰狞面目和阴险无耻的本性；全世界人民更看清楚了：谁在维护和平，谁在发动侵略战争。全世界人民将加强斗争，给侵略者以严重打击，来保卫世界和平。
    我们坚决拥护金日成、彭德怀两将军的抗议。美帝国主义如果继续采取无耻狡赖的态度，一切严重后果将由它来负责。

   （五）编辑同志：
    看到报载美国飞机轰炸、扫射开城中立区，企图谋害我方代表的消息时，我感到万分愤慨！自从朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，我们为了争取和平，已做了多次的让步。而美帝国主义却一直采取欺骗、恫吓、拖延的手段，阴谋破坏谈判，扩大侵略战争。最近，紧接着枪杀我军事警察姚庆祥排长之后，更轰炸、扫射开城中立区。这一连串无耻的破坏行为，使我们更清楚地看到了美帝国主义的狰狞面目。
    美帝国主义是在全世界人民压力之下，在中朝人民军队打击之下被迫同意进行谈判的。事实证明，嗜战成性的帝国主义者是没有和平诚意的。它把中朝人民为争取和平所作的让步当作懦弱的表示，而进行公开的挑衅。中朝人民的忍耐是有限度的。正如邓华将军在追悼姚庆祥烈士的大会上曾说：“如果我们不能经过谈判而争得和平，那我们就必须用反侵略的斗争来赢得和平。”这代表了全中国人民的意志。全中国人民要继续深入展开抗美援朝运动，准备给敢于发动战争的侵略者以严重的打击。
