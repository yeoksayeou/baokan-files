Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th—The following is the full text of the reply from Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces: General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces:
	Your letter of reply of September 17 has been received.

	Your letter and the letter from your chief representative, General Joye, to our chief representative, General Nam Il, on September 11, both acknowledge the fact that United Nations aircraft strafed the Kaesong neutral zone on September 10. However, your side still denies the previous incidents before September 10 in which the United Nations forces violated the Kaesong neutral zone agreement in the air and on the ground, making it impossible for the Kaesong talks to continue. However, this denial cannot change or eliminate all the physical and testimonial evidence we have regarding these incidents. Therefore, these incidents of which we accuse you must be dealt with responsibly.

	In view of the fact that your side has expressed regret for the recent incident of the United Nations forces destroying the Kaesong neutral zone and is willing to be held responsible for the destruction of the Kaesong neutral zone agreement, in order to prevent the above-mentioned outstanding incidents from continuing to hinder the progress of the negotiations between the two sides, we suggest that the representatives of you and us should immediately resume the armistice negotiations in Kaesong without the need to discuss the conditions for the resumption of the armistice negotiations.

	As for dealing with the above-mentioned outstanding incidents and stipulating and guaranteeing a strict agreement on the neutralization of the Kaesong district, we suggest that a suitable institution be organized by both parties at the first meeting of the resumed armistice negotiations in Kaesong to undertake these tasks. Naturally, all agreements of this appropriate institution must be approved by the delegations of both parties before they can take effect.

	If you agree, please order your liaison officer to negotiate with our liaison officer on the date and time for resuming the negotiations in Kaesong.

	Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
	Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers

    鉴于美方已对最近一次破坏中立区事件表示遗憾并愿对破坏协议持负责态度
    金日成彭德怀将军建议恢复开城谈判
    同时建议由双方协议组织适当机构处理我方各次指控事件，规定和保证开城区中立化的严格的协议。
    【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成、中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀给联合国军总司令李奇微的答复，全文如下：联合国军李奇微总司令：
    你九月十七日的复信收到了。
    你的来信及你方首席代表乔埃将军在九月十一日给我方首席代表南日将军的来信，均承认了联合国军飞机在九月十日扫射开城中立区的事实。但你方却仍然否认九月十日以前联合国军在空中在地面上违反开城中立区协议使开城谈判无法继续进行的各次事件，可是这种否认决不能改变或取消我方所掌握的关于这些事件的一切人证和物证，因之对于这些我方指控的事件必须进行负责的处理。
    鉴于你方已经对最近一次联合国军破坏开城中立区的事件表示遗憾，并愿对于开城中立区协议的破坏持负责态度，因此，为了不使上述那些未了事件继续妨碍双方谈判的进行，我们建议：你我双方代表应即恢复在开城的停战谈判，而无需要再去讨论恢复停战谈判的条件。
    至于处理上述那些未了事件，并规定和保证开城区中立化的严格的协议，我们建议：在开城停战谈判恢复的第一次会议上由双方协议组织一个适当的机构来担负这些任务，自然这个适当机构的一切协议，均须得到双方代表团的批准方能生效。
    你如同意，望即命令你方联络官与我方联络官洽商在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
        一九五一年九月十九日
