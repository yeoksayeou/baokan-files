Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker" in London, reported from Kaesong on the 5th: Van Fleet's "offensive with limited objectives" and Ridgway's attempts to sabotage the armistice negotiations here through bombing and shooting have both met with decisive failure. The purpose of these attacks—which were not so limited—was to put pressure on Korea and China to accept American demands. Van Fleet said a week ago: The enemy is in tatters. Our line-up is complete. Now his tone has changed to: The Eighth Army is able to hold the current line of defense. Americans may one day believe that patience on this side is not weakness.

Military sources here said today that Van Fleet's claim that there are "Caucasian volunteer soldiers" on the North Korean side is a "complete fabrication." He said: "The purpose of this fabrication is mainly for the San Francisco conference." Undoubtedly, Van Fleet learned the term "Caucasian" from the Associated Press, which called two reporters—Béchard of "Ce Soir" and me—"Caucasians". I can say that, apart from embassy staff, these two reporters are the only "Caucasians" on the North Korean side—and they are completely unarmed. This news may have been fabricated by people who saw Béchard and me walking near Kaesong.

Nearly five days have passed since the last incident. During this period, the violation of the neutral zone was the overflight of aircraft. The next step is up to Ridgway, who must decide: will he guarantee that there will be no more violations of the neutral zone? Or will he openly take responsibility for ending the negotiations?

### 英工人日报记者揭露美国侵略者的无耻谎言

    揭露美国侵略者的无耻谎言
    【新华社六日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿五日自开城报道：范佛里特的“目标有限的攻势”和李奇微以轰炸和射击的办法来破坏这里的停战谈判的企图，同样遭到了决定性的失败。这些攻击——并不是那么有限的——的目的是对朝鲜和中国施以压力，使它们接受美国的要求。范佛里特在一周前说：敌人已残破不堪了。我们的阵容是完整的。现在，他的语调已改变为：第八军能够守住目前的防线。美国人或许有一天会相信，这边的耐心并不是软弱。
    此间高级军方人士今天说，范佛里特所说北朝鲜方面有“高加索种志愿军”一点是“彻头彻尾的捏造”。他说：“这个捏造的目的主要是为了旧金山会议。”无疑问的，范佛里特是从合众社学会高加索种这个名辞的，合众社把今晚报记者贝却敌和我叫做高加索种人。我可以说，除了大使馆人员以外，这两位记者是北朝鲜方面仅有的“高加索种”——而且是完全没有武装的。这个消息可能是看到贝却敌和我在开城附近散步的人所造出来的。
    上次事件发生以来，已将近五天。这期间，侵犯中立区的事件是飞机飞越中立区。下一步要看李奇微的了，他必须决定：是保证不再发生侵犯中立区的事件呢？还是公开承担结束谈判的责任？
