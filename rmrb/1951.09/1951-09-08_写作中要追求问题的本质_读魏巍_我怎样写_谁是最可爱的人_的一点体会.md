    Striving for the Essence of Problems in Writing
    ——Some Thoughts After Reading Wei Wei's "How I Wrote 'Who Are the Most Lovable People'"
To the Editor:
    After reading Comrade Wei Wei’s article "How I Wrote 'Who Are the Most Lovable People'," it has been of great help to my writing. I am an intellectual who joined the revolution and has been working in the company. I love to write, but I don’t write well. The people living around me are all soldiers, heroes, models… Logically, I should be able to write good things. However, my attitude towards life is not down-to-earth. I have never carefully observed life, let alone paid attention to the fresh things happening in life and the ins and outs of these things. I always think that everything around me is ordinary. After reading what Comrade Wei Wei said: "Deep feelings in real life are so important for writers! If you feel deeply, what you write will naturally have a kind of energy, and people will feel deeply when they read it; if you feel shallowly, what people receive from you will also be shallow. If you haven't been moved at all, then there is no need to talk about it." In the past, I did not understand this point enough.
    I once wrote a manuscript titled "Model Worker, People's Hero – Comrade Geng Shengtang." I listed his more prominent deeds since he joined the army, how he earned a merit, a second merit… one by one, and wrote them in a well-organized and concrete manner. I thought I wrote it quite well, so I sent it to the newspaper. After a few days, the manuscript was returned. I was a little dissatisfied. I thought, "Such a comprehensive manuscript cannot be used, so what kind of manuscript do they want?"
    In addition, I also wrote a manuscript about revolutionary friendship. I described how a squad leader cared for his soldiers, using his allowance to buy medicine for the soldiers, and taking care of the soldiers in various ways in life… I almost wrote about the squad leader’s care for the soldiers in every detail, and also wrote about some of the soldiers' feelings on the surface, but the manuscript was still not published.
    Why are these two manuscripts so comprehensive and narratively specific, yet still not well written? Now I have found the real answer from Comrade Wei Wei's article. He said: "How do I express this theme? First of all, I hope to pursue the most essential thing. In Korea, I often thought about a question: Why are our soldiers so brave? They are simply not afraid of death! Where does that high degree of heroism come from?..." From here, I realized that in writing, I neglected such an essential thing, and did not ask in return: Why can our heroes work so actively? Why does our squad leader care so much for the soldiers? There is an essential question hidden here – a question of class essence.
    Reading Comrade Wei Wei’s article has made me realize that pursuing the essence of problems is the most important thing in writing, and only in this way can the ideological nature of the work be enhanced.

    写作中要追求问题的本质
    ——读魏巍“我怎样写‘谁是最可爱的人’”的一点体会编辑同志：
    我读了魏巍同志的“我怎样写‘谁是最可爱的人’”的文章以后，对我的写作有很大帮助。我是一个知识分子，参加革命后就在连队里工作，很爱写作，但写得不好。在我周围生活着的都是战士、英雄、模范……。按理，我是应该能写出很好的东西来的。但我对于生活的态度很不踏实，从没有好好留心观察生活，更不要说注意在生活中所发生的新鲜的事情，以及这些事情的来龙去脉了。我总认为在我生活的周围，都是一些平凡的事情。读了魏巍同志所提出的：“在现实生活中的深入感受，对写作的人是多么重要！你感受得深了，写出来，也就必然有那么一股子劲，人家读了，也就感受得深；你感受得浅，人家从你这儿受到的，也就浅。你根本还没有感动呢，那就用不着说了。”对于这一点，过去我是理解得不够的。
    我曾经写过一篇“工作模范、人民功臣—耿生堂同志”的稿件。我把他从参军以后比较突出的事例，怎样立一次功、二次功……一一罗列出来，而且写得层次分明，确实具体。我自认为写得还不坏，于是就寄到报社去了。不几天这篇稿退回来了，我有点不满意，我想：“这样全面的稿子还不能用，那又要什么稿子呢？”
    此外，我又写过一篇关于革命友爱的稿子。我描写了一个班长怎样体贴战士，将自己的津贴费给战士买药吃，在生活上多般照顾战士……。几乎把班长对战士的照顾写得无微不至，而且也从表面上写了一些战士的感情，结果稿子还是登不出来。
    为什么这两篇稿子既已写得全面，叙事又具体，而还是写不好呢？现在我才从魏巍同志这篇文章中找到真正的答案。他说：“我怎样来表现这一主题呢？首先，我希图追求着最本质的东西。在朝鲜，我脑子里经常想着一个问题：我们的战士，为什么那样英勇呢？就硬是不怕死呵！那种高度的英雄气概是从什么地方来的呢？……”从这里，我才认识到在写作中我就是忽视了这样一个本质的东西，没有反过来问：我们的功臣为什么能积极工作？我们的班长为什么那样爱护战士？这里面隐藏着一个本质的问题，——一个阶级本质的问题。
    读了魏巍同志这一篇文章，使我认识到在写作中追求问题的本质是最重要的事情，也只有这样，才能增强作品的思想性。
