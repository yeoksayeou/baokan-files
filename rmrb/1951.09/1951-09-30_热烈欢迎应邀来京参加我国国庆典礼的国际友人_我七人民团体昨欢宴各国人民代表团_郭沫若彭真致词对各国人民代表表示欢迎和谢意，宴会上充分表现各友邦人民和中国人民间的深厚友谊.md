We Chinese people like friends, and we call our best friends 'soulmates,' that is, those who know ourselves.

Such friends will bring us intimate care, warm encouragement, and well-intentioned criticism.

Such friends will bring us the enthusiasm of unity, the strength to defend peace, and the wisdom to increase happiness.

You are our Chinese people's 'soulmates,' and thank you for bringing many spiritual gifts; therefore, we sincerely hope that you can know more about our China.

China is a very young country, but also a very old country. We have returned to spring after a long winter.

We are striving for eternal spring, working hard to eliminate all contradictions, and building our People's China into a peaceful, happy, and beautiful garden.

The people of the whole world have common hopes, and we hope that all countries in the world will become the same garden; therefore, it will make our world a people's world in eternal spring.

Please drink to the realization of this beautiful vision, and wish all dear friends good health."

"Dear comrades and friends:

On behalf of various Soviet social organizations, we extend our heartfelt and warm respects to you. We are very honored to be able to represent various Soviet social organizations to participate in the National Day of the People's Republic of China. China has achieved great achievements in various constructions and in culture. Let us celebrate this achievement together. Let us drink to the great Chinese people and the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong."

Head of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China Delivers Speech

Sundar Lal, the head of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China, delivered a speech, saying:

"Our Indian delegation is very honored to be invited to participate in China's National Day. We are grateful to our Chinese friends for their warm welcome and hospitality. The facts of China in the past two years have proven to the world that as long as the people stand up and fight, they will not be defeated by anyone. In India, everyone cares about China's struggle. I deeply believe that the liberation and future happiness of the Chinese people symbolize the liberation and happiness of the people of the whole world.

The people of the whole world are carrying out the struggle for liberation, and the Indian people and the Chinese people are equally carrying out such a struggle. Ladies and gentlemen, the Indian people and the China people are always standing together in the struggle of the world people for liberation. We want to maintain peace with the world, and we want to keep our friendship with Britain and the United States. When the Indian and Chinese people unite, we can do these better.

Dear Chinese friends, dear brothers and sisters, tens of millions of Indian people are standing with the Chinese people, and the Indian people are uniting with the Chinese people regardless of all difficulties. We believe that this is the only way to defend peace.

Let us drink to the friendship between the Indian and Chinese people, and to the friendship between the people of the whole world."

Head of the Mongolian People's Observation Delegation Delivers Speech

Ts. Damdinsuren, the head of the Mongolian People's Observation Delegation, then delivered a speech, saying:

"Today we gather in Beijing, the ancient capital and new capital of great China. Beijing has many cultural monuments, and now under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, it is radiating golden light in all directions.

Although Beijing and Moscow are far apart, they have many things in common. Beijing and Moscow have equally become prosperous and magnificent cities of peace and unity of all ethnic groups, consolidating the cause of peace, and giving full play to free labor.

The passes of the Great Wall and the gates of Beijing, which blocked various ethnic groups in the early years, are open to the loyal and good people of the world. From this gate, the representatives of Mongolia come to congratulate the great and heroic Chinese working people.

Today, together with the Chinese people are Mongolian female workers, Soviet scholars, Indian writers, Indonesian poets, and Korean combatants. This is the symbol of the great peace and unity of all ethnic groups. This peace is guided by Lenin and Stalin, and is the indestructible and consolidated peace of all ethnic groups in the world. Let us drink to the greater victories of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao."

Head of the Hungarian Delegation Delivers Speech

István Havas, the head of the Hungarian delegation, delivered a speech, saying:

"Dear comrades and friends:

On behalf of the Hungarian people, I extend my heartfelt and warm greetings to the great Chinese people! We are very happy to come to your motherland, and we are very honored to celebrate the great day of the liberation of the Chinese people with you. In our country, everyone envies me for being able to come to the sacred land of China. In the short few days of our arrival, we have left a deep impression of friendship. I propose a toast to the eternal friendship between China and the Chinese and Hungarian people."

Head of the Delegation of the German Democratic Republic Delivers Speech

Diether, the head of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a speech, saying:

"Dear friends:

The delegation of the German Democratic Republic brought not only the friendship of the delegation members, but the friendship of the entire German Democratic Republic. We are very proud to be able to participate in the second National Day of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet October Revolution not only set an example for China, but also set an example for Germany, enabling the German people to fight for the unification of all Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty. At the Berlin Youth Peace Festival, the German people expressed their friendship to the Chinese people and other people. Today, here, we have again seen the friendship of the Chinese people to the German people and other people. Today, all peace-loving people in the peace camp under the leadership of Stalin are turning their thoughts to Korea, where the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting for peace. Let us drink to the great Chinese people and their great leader Mao Zedong."

Head of the Indonesian People's Observation Delegation Delivers Speech

Tabrani, the head of the Indonesian People's Observation Delegation, then delivered a speech, saying:

"Dear Chinese brothers, please accept our lofty salute.

The struggle of the Chinese and Indonesian people is consistent. The Indonesian people are learning various experiences from China.

The Chinese people have won victory in the struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people's revolution is like a huge wave, and it must affect the entire Asia. The Indonesian people are not only against American and British imperialism, but also against French and Dutch imperialism. The Indonesian people will, like the Chinese people, eradicate all imperialism from our country. Indonesia is facing various difficulties, so it needs to establish close relations with China.

I feel like I'm at home standing among you. The Chinese revolution may be different from Indonesia’s, but our goals are the same. On behalf of the Indonesian delegation, I propose a toast to the friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people, to the friendship of all nations, and to world peace."

Head of the Burmese Delegation Delivers Speech

Next, Dechin Ko Tu Mai, the head of the Burmese delegation, delivered a speech, saying: "Dear friends:

The Burmese People's Observation Delegation has come to celebrate China's National Day and world peace. The Chinese people and the Burmese people have always fought like brothers for world peace. Among the countries in Asia, like India and Burma, they have been oppressed by imperialism. For nearly a hundred years, China has suffered the deepest imperialist aggression. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, China has changed from weak to strong, which makes various Asian countries very happy. Now we hope that China, the strongest country in Asia, and India can help us. If China and India can help us, Burma will be liberated, Asian countries will be liberated, and the world can achieve peace.

The Burmese people regard the Chinese people as compatriots and brothers, and their relationship has always been friendly. The Burmese people call Americans Americans and Britons Britons, but they call the Chinese compatriots, brothers and sisters, which shows that we respect and befriend the Chinese people very much.

Today we are very happy to come here to meet with the people of various Asian countries, especially for China's National Day and for the cause of world peace, we feel particularly happy.

Burma needs independence and freedom. The imperialist oppression of mankind endangers peace. We hope that the oppressed brother countries will unite, then our goals can be achieved, and world peace can be achieved. We can forever not see war and foreign rule in the world.

Let us drink to the unity of the Asian people, to world peace, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong!"

Head of the Vietnamese People's Delegation Delivers Speech

Tôn Đức Thắng, the head of the Vietnamese People's Delegation, then delivered a speech, saying: "Dear friends:

Our Vietnamese delegation, representing the Vietnamese people who are taking up arms to fight against the French imperialist colonial aggressors and the American imperialist interventionists, pays tribute to you.

I celebrate the great victory of the Chinese revolution, which is also a celebration of the growth of world peace and democracy forces. In the First World War, the success of the Soviet Union's great October Revolution proved that justice triumphs over violence. After the Second World War, the success of the Chinese revolution and the brilliant construction carried out in the past two years have also shown that the law that justice triumphs over violence is an inviolable law.

Therefore, today the Vietnamese people celebrate the National Day of the People's Republic of China and believe even more that the construction cause of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements, the Korean people will surely defeat the American aggressors with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Vietnamese people's struggle against the French imperialist colonial aggressors and the American imperialist interventionists will surely win, and the world's peace and democracy cause will surely win.

Please raise your glasses and drink to the consolidation and development of the revolutionary victory of the Chinese people, the victory of the Korean people, the victory of the Vietnamese people, and the victory of the world's people."

Vice Chairman Peng Zhen Speaks on Behalf of Various Organizations

Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee, finally delivered a speech, saying:

"I now represent various organizations to thank you for your presence and participation in our banquet. At today's banquet, the deep friendship and solid unity between our friendly nations and the people of various countries have been fully demonstrated. Our friendship and unity are a kind of power, a great power. This power can stop imperialist aggression, defend peace and defend democracy.

Dear friends, dear comrades, let us drink to the development and consolidation of our friendship and unity, to the unity of the people of the world to stop imperialist aggression and defend peace. To the health of Stalin, the leader of the peace-loving people of the world, to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, and to your health."

The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. After the meeting, a recreational evening was held, with acrobatic performances. (Attached pictures)

    “今天我们在伟大中国的故都和新的首都北京相聚。北京有许多文化古迹，现在在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下向四方八面放射着金色的光芒。
    北京和莫斯科虽然相距很远，但相同的地方很多。北京和莫斯科同样成为各族人民和平团结、巩固和平事业、发挥自由劳动的繁荣雄壮的城市了。
    早年阻隔各民族的长城的关口和北京的大门都为世界上忠实善良的人们开着，就从这个大门里蒙古的代表走来向伟大的英勇的中国劳动人民致贺。
    今天和中国人民在一起的有蒙古的女工、苏联的学者、印度的作家、印尼的诗人、朝鲜的战斗员，这就是各族人民伟大和平团结的象征。这个和平是由列宁、斯大林导引的，是世界各民族的不可摧毁的巩固的和平。让我们为中国共产党及伟大领袖毛主席领导下得到胜利的中国人民在将来的更大的胜利而干杯。”

    德意志民主共和国代表团狄特团长发表讲演说：
    “亲爱的朋友们：
    德意志民主共和国代表团所带来的不仅是代表团员的友谊，而是全德意志民主共和国的友谊。我们能参加中华人民共和国的第二届国庆节很感骄傲。苏联的十月革命不仅给中国树立了一个榜样，而且给德国树立了一个榜样，使德国人民为全德国的统一和缔结和平公约而斗争。在柏林青年和平联欢节上，德国人民表示了他对中国人民和其他人民的友谊，今天在这儿我们又看到了中国人民对德国人民及其他人民的友谊。今天，在斯大林领导下的和平阵营的所有爱好和平的人民都把思想转到朝鲜，在那儿朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军正在为和平而斗争。让我们为伟大的中国人民及其伟大的领袖毛泽东干杯。”印尼人民观礼代表团团长致词印度尼西亚人民观礼代表团团长塔勃兰尼接着发表讲演，他说：
    “亲爱的中国兄弟们，请接受我们的崇高的敬礼。
    中国和印尼人民的斗争是一致的。印尼人民正在学习中国的各种经验。
    中国人民已在反对帝国主义的斗争中赢得了胜利。中国人民的革命像巨大的波浪，它一定要影响整个亚洲。印尼人民不仅反对美国和英国帝国主义，而且也反对法国和荷兰帝国主义。印尼人民将要像中国人民一样把一切帝国主义从我们国家里连根拔掉。印尼正面临着各种各样的困难，所以它需要和中国建立密切的关系。
    我现在站在你们中间好像在家里一样。中国的革命方式可能和印尼不同，但是我们的目标是一致的。我代表印尼代表团，建议为中国人民和印尼人民的友谊、为一切民族的友谊、为世界和平干杯。”
    缅甸代表团团长致词
    接着，缅甸代表团团长德钦哥都迈发表讲演，他说：“亲爱的朋友们：
    缅甸人民观礼代表团是为了庆祝中国国庆节和世界和平而来的。中国人民和缅甸人民一向如兄弟一样的为世界和平而斗争。在亚洲的各个国家中，像印度和缅甸都受到帝国主义的压迫。近百年来，中国受帝国主义的侵略最深。中国在毛泽东主席的领导下由弱转强，使亚洲各个国家非常快乐。现在我们希望亚洲最强的国家中国和印度能够帮助我们。如果中国和印度能够帮助我们，缅甸一定能得到解放，亚洲国家一定能够得到解放，世界就可以得到和平。
    缅甸人民把中国人民当作同胞兄弟，关系一向友善。缅甸人民把美国人叫做美国人，英国人叫做英国人，但是把中国人叫做同胞的兄弟姊妹，这表示我们对中国人民非常尊敬非常友好。
    今天我们来到这里，和亚洲各国人民会见，感到非常高兴，尤其是为了中国国庆，为了世界和平事业，我们感到特别的高兴。
    缅甸需要独立和自由。帝国主义对人类的压迫危害了和平。我们希望被压迫的兄弟国家团结起来，那么我们的目的就能达到，世界和平就能得到。我们就可以永远不再看见世界上有战争和外国的统治了。
    让我们为亚洲人民的团结，为世界和平，为毛泽东主席的健康干杯！”
    越南人民代表团团长致词
    越南人民代表团团长孙德胜接着发表演说，他说：“亲爱的朋友们：
    我们越南代表团代表正拿起武器向法帝国主义殖民侵略者和美帝国主义干涉者作斗争的越南人民向诸位致敬。
    我庆祝中国革命的伟大胜利也就是庆祝世界和平民主力量的增长。第一次世界大战中，苏联伟大的十月革命的成功证明了正义战胜暴力。第二次世界大战之后，中国革命的成功和两年来进行的辉煌建设，也说明了正义战胜暴力的规律是一个不能违反的规律。
    因此今天越南人民庆祝中华人民共和国国庆，更相信在毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民的建设事业一定能获得更辉煌的成就，朝鲜人民在中国人民志愿军的支援下一定能战胜美国侵略者，越南人民反对法帝国主义殖民侵略者和美帝国主义干涉者的斗争一定胜利，全世界和平民主事业一定胜利。
    请诸位举杯，为巩固和发展中国人民的革命胜利、朝鲜人民的胜利、越南人民的胜利和世界人民的胜利干杯。”
    彭真副主席代表各团体讲话
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会彭真副主席最后发表讲演说：
    “我现在代表各团体，感谢各位光临，参加我们的宴会。在今天的宴会上，充分地表现了我们各友邦和各国人民之间的深厚的友谊和巩固的团结。我们大家的友谊和团结便是一种力量，是一种伟大的力量。这种力量可以制止帝国主义的侵略，保卫和平保卫民主。
    各位朋友，各位同志。让我们为发展、巩固我们的友谊和团结，为全世界人民团结起来制止帝国主义侵略、保卫和平而干杯。为全世界爱好和平的人民的领袖斯大林的健康、为毛泽东主席的健康、为各位的健康而干杯。”
