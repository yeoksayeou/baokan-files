Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. All circles in the capital held a celebration rally in Zhongshan Park Concert Hall at 3 pm today to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Present were Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Peng Zhen, Li Jishen, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Ma Xulun, Peng Zemin, Situ Meitang, Xu Deheng, Liu Ningyi, Jiang Nanxiang, Liang Xi, Zhu Kezhen and other representatives from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, as well as cadres from various aspects of the capital and representatives of people from all walks of life, totaling more than 5,000 people.

The conference began in the solemn sound of the national anthem. Chairman Guo Moruo delivered the opening speech. He said: "In commemorating the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan today, we must love our leader Chairman Mao even more, and love our Chinese Communist Party even more. Only with the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party can there be the great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the victory of the People's Liberation War, and the birth of our glorious People's Republic of China. In commemorating the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan today, we must love our great ally the Soviet Union even more. In the Second World War, the Soviet Union was the main force and decisive factor in destroying the fascist Axis powers. In May 1945, the Soviet Union eliminated Nazi Germany in the West, and in August, it returned east and defeated the most elite Kwantung Army of Japanese imperialism, thus forcing the Japanese imperialists to surrender. In commemorating the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan today, we must hate U.S. imperialism even more. Japanese imperialism was originally a watchdog fostered by U.S. and British imperialism. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, U.S. imperialism secretly supported Japanese imperialism, providing it with a large amount of gasoline, scrap iron, cotton, and machines as capital for its war of aggression. Recently, it has colluded with British imperialism to announce a unilaterally drafted "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan," preparing for its vassal states to sign and pledge at the San Francisco Conference. U.S. imperialism fundamentally denies the rights of the Chinese people and the Asian people, and it wants to transform Japanese imperialism into its vanguard for Eastern aggression again. We must strengthen resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, resolutely oppose the rearming of Japan, and resolutely oppose the unilateral U.S.-British peace treaty with Japan."

Then, Peng Zhen, representing the Chinese Communist Party, spoke. Peng Zhen first pointed out the great significance of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. He pointed out that this victory laid the foundation for the complete victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, and from then on, the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism went from failure to victory.

Peng Zhen then pointed out: The Chinese people suffered the greatest sacrifices in the War of Resistance Against Japan, fought against Japan for the longest time, and made extremely great contributions. The rights of the Chinese people in formulating and passing the peace treaty with Japan cannot be denied by anyone. Now, the U.S. imperialists and their vassal states at the San Francisco Conference have unreasonably excluded China, and according to the plan of the U.S. aggressors, disregarding China's contribution to the War of Resistance Against Japan, disregarding the agreements of the anti-fascist countries in the Second World War, and disregarding the just demands of the Soviet Union and other Asian countries, they are formulating a unilateral treaty, rearming Japan, and forcing the participants to sign without allowing modifications. This is unreasonable, barbaric, and illegal. Our Foreign Minister Zhou has issued a solemn statement: "The preparation, drafting, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan, without the participation of the People's Republic of China, regardless of its content and outcome, the Central People's Government considers it all to be illegal and therefore invalid." This is not only the unanimous demand of all the Chinese people, but also represents the just demands of peace-loving people all over the world. We will adhere to this position and strive for its complete realization.

Peng Zhen spoke about the Korean War. He pointed out: The Korean War is a war of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism in order to dominate the world and to follow the old path of Japanese bandits in invading China. Now U.S. imperialism has been battered and bruised under the heavy blows of the Chinese and Korean people's armies. Peng Zhen reviewed the Chinese people's resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, saying: We Chinese people have always loved peace. After the outbreak of the Korean War, our Foreign Minister Zhou sternly warned U.S. imperialism, but the enemy blatantly disregarded everything and expanded the war of aggression against Korea, and at one time approached the Yalu River, directly threatening our national defense line. In order to aid our neighbor Korea and protect the security of our motherland, the Chinese people had to organize volunteers to support the Korean people in resisting American aggression.

Peng Zhen then pointed out that the practice of the Korean War proves that the American robbers are just paper tigers in the face of the heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, and that what the enemy has gained in Korea is nothing but a "bottomless pit." The Chinese and Korean People's Armies have basically not used planes and tanks, while the enemy has used all the weapons it can use. As a result of the war, the enemy's casualties exceeded the first year of the Second World War. Our morale is getting stronger and stronger, while the enemy's morale is declining day by day. U.S. imperialism, because it has suffered such a shameful defeat, coupled with the pressure of peace-loving people all over the world, has accepted Malik's suggestion and requested negotiations for an armistice. It attempts to use peace talks to save the annihilation of the American aggressor troops. Peng Zhen said: Facts have proved that war merchants who make war their business are afraid of war in the face of the heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people. But war merchants are, after all, in the business of war, so they are very afraid of peace. They are not thinking about peace but war, not about achieving peace in Korea through negotiations, but about achieving their aggressive goals through peace talks. Therefore, after the start of the armistice negotiations, U.S. imperialism has continuously created excuses to delay the negotiations, and recently has shamelessly and openly violated the neutral zone and openly murdered peace talk representatives in order to sabotage the armistice negotiations.

Why is the United States sabotaging the armistice negotiations in this way?

Peng Zhen pointed out: It is to continue to maintain a tense war atmosphere in order to conclude an illegal peace treaty with Japan, pass a huge military budget, expand armaments and prepare for war, openly carry out war mobilization, and maintain excess profits for financial oligarchs and arms merchants.

When U.S. imperialism has not suffered enough fatal blows, its war of aggression in Korea will not end. In order to win a victorious end to the Korean War, the war merchants of the United States must be given heavier and heavier blows so that these war merchants will retreat in the face of difficulties. Peng Zhen pointed out: This is a truth proved by the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism for more than a hundred years and by this Korean War. Only when the people of the world unite to give these war instigators and destroyers of world peace a fatal blow can a new world war be stopped and world peace be defended.

Peng Zhen emphasized: In order to win a victorious end to the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, to liberate Taiwan, to crush the U.S. imperialist plan to separately conclude peace with Japan and arm Japan, and to defend the security of our motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, we must continue to strengthen the sacred movement against American aggression and support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteers. Peng Zhen finally called on the people of the whole country to strive to realize the propositions in the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations on the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said in his speech: On the Eastern battlefield six years ago, the Chinese People's Army resisted more than two million Japanese invading troops for a long time and won countless brilliant victories. The Soviet Union also consistently contained one million elite Japanese troops on the Far Eastern border and eliminated Japan's famous Kwantung Army in August 1945. China and the Soviet Union were the main forces in the East against Japan, playing a decisive role in winning victory at that time. Just as we commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, U.S. and British imperialism have issued the so-called "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan," excluding the People's Republic of China from the countries at war with Japan, tearing up international agreements, and vainly attempting to turn the actions of arming Japan and threatening China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries for six years into "legal." We firmly oppose the illegal U.S.-British peace treaty with Japan, and strengthening the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the best manifestation of commemorating the victory of the War of Resistance today. We must pay our donations as soon as possible and continue to launch a movement to donate weapons. Under the banner of the great Mao Zedong, we will fight to shatter the U.S.-British plan for a war of aggression and defend lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Zhang Bojun, Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, pointed out in his speech: The U.S. imperialist launch of the Korean War and the formulation of a unilateral treaty are opposed by the people of the world. U.S. imperialism has completely destroyed the agreements made by major countries in the past ten years. Its future is certain death. He said that we must unite further, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and strive to defeat U.S. imperialism.

Zhang Naiqi, convener of the National Affairs Promotion Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in his speech: Today's situation is very different from the situation during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and is greatly beneficial to the revolutionary people. Although U.S. imperialism is more ferocious and more vicious than Japanese imperialism, the strength of the Chinese people and the people of the world is incomparably strong. Victory must belong to us.

Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, called on workers across the country in his speech to carry out a patriotic production donation movement, strengthen the country's defense capabilities, and defend world peace. He said: U.S. imperialism, regardless of the opposition of the Chinese people and the people of the world, is unilaterally concluding peace with Japan and rearming Japan. In Korea, it is using various methods to sabotage the negotiations. Our people across the country should strengthen preparations and heighten vigilance. He said: The Chinese people have stood up, and the force against U.S. imperialism has become more consolidated. We will definitely be able to achieve victory.

The conference ended with shouts of "Long live the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan," "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship," "Oppose arming Japan," "Oppose the U.S.-British peace treaty with Japan," and "Down with U.S. imperialism." (Attached picture)

    纪念抗日战争胜利六周年
    首都各界昨举行庆祝大会
    彭真同志号召继续加强抗美援朝
    为实现“九三”联合宣言而奋斗
    【新华社二日讯】首都各界庆祝抗日战争胜利六周年大会于今日下午三时在中山公园音乐堂举行。到有中国人民政协全国委员会、各民主党派、各人民团体代表郭沫若、陈叔通、彭真、李济深、章伯钧、章乃器、马叙伦、彭泽民、司徒美堂、许德珩、刘宁一、蒋南翔、梁希、竺可桢等以及首都各方面干部和各界人民代表共五千余人。
    大会在庄严的国歌声中开始。主席郭沫若致开会词。他说：“在纪念抗日战争胜利的今天，我们要加倍热爱我们的领袖毛主席，热爱我们的中国共产党。有了毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导，才能有抗日战争的伟大胜利，才能有人民解放战争的胜利，才能有我们光辉灿烂的中华人民共和国的诞生。在纪念抗日战争胜利的今天，我们要加倍热爱我们伟大的盟邦苏联。第二次大战中苏联是摧毁法西斯轴心国联盟的主力和决定因素。一九四五年的五月，苏联在西方消灭了纳粹德国，八月回师东向，又击溃了日本帝国主义最精锐的关东军，因而使日本帝国主义者投降了。在纪念抗日战争胜利的今天，我们要加倍憎恨美帝国主义。日本帝国主义本来是美英帝国主义所扶植起来的看门狗。在抗日战争中，美帝国主义曾暗中支持着日本帝国主义，把大量的汽油、废铁、棉花、机器供给它作为侵略战争的股本。最近更和英帝国主义狼狈为奸公布了擅自拟定的“对日和约草案”，准备在旧金山会议由它的仆从国签字划押。美帝国主义根本否认了我们中国人民和亚洲人民的权利，它要把日本帝国主义重新化为它的东方侵略的先锋队。我们要加强抗美援朝，坚决反对重新武装日本，坚决反对美英片面对日和约。”
    继由中国共产党代表彭真讲话。彭真首先指出抗日战争胜利的伟大意义。他指出这一胜利奠定了中国人民解放斗争全部胜利的基础，从此中国人民反帝国主义斗争从失败走到胜利。
    彭真接着指出：中国人民在抗日战争中遭受牺牲最大，对日作战最久，贡献极其伟大。中国人民在制定和通过对日和约的问题上的权利，是任何人所不能否认的。现在美帝国主义及其仆从国家在旧金山的会议，竟然无理地排斥中国在外，并且按照美国侵略者的计划，无视中国在抗日战争中的贡献，无视反法西斯各国在第二次世界大战中的协定，无视苏联及亚洲其他国家正义的主张，制定片面和约，重新武装日本，并且对与会者强迫签字不许修改。这是无理的，蛮横的，非法的。我国周外长已发表严正声明：“对日和约的准备、拟制和签订，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其内容和结果如何，中央人民政府一概认为是非法的，因而也是无效的。”这不仅是全中国人民一致的主张，而且代表全世界爱好和平人民的正义要求。我们将坚持这个主张，并且为这个主张的彻底实现而奋斗。
    彭真说到朝鲜战争问题。他指出：朝鲜战争是美帝国主义为了独霸世界，为了循着日本强盗的故路侵略中国而发动的侵略战争。现在美帝国主义在中朝人民军队的沉重打击下，已经头破血流了。彭真回溯我国人民抗美援朝的经过说：我们中国人民是一向爱好和平的，朝鲜战争爆发之后，我国周外长曾严正地警告过美帝国主义，但是敌人悍然不顾一切扩大侵朝战争，并曾一度迫近鸭绿江，直接威胁到我国国防线。为了援助邻邦朝鲜和保卫我们祖国的安全，中国人民不能不组织志愿军，支援朝鲜人民，抵抗美国侵略。
    彭真接着指出朝鲜战争的实践，证明了美国强盗在中朝人民的英勇斗争面前不过是纸老虎，而敌人在朝鲜所得的不过是“无底洞”。中朝人民部队现在在基本上还没有使用飞机坦克，敌人则使用了所有可以使用的武器，战争的结果，使敌人的伤亡超过第二次世界大战的第一年，我们的士气愈战愈强，敌人的士气则日益低落，美帝国主义因为遭受了这样可耻的失败，加上全世界和平人民的压力，才接受马立克的建议，要求谈判停战。它企图用和平谈判来挽救美国侵略军的覆灭。彭真说：事实证明，以战争为业的战争贩子在中朝人民英勇斗争面前是惧怕战争的。但是战争贩子毕竟是以战争为业的，所以又十分惧怕和平，他们处心积虑的不是和平而是战争，不是经过谈判使朝鲜获得和平，而是要经过和谈达到它的侵略目的。因此，停战谈判开始之后，美帝国主义就不断地制造藉口，拖延谈判，最近竟无耻的公然侵犯中立区，公然谋害和谈代表，来破坏停战谈判。
    美国为什么要这样破坏停战谈判？
    彭真指出：它就是为了继续保持紧张的战争空气，以便缔结非法的对日和约，通过庞大的军事预算，扩军备战，公开进行战争动员，并为了金融寡头，军火商人保持超额利润。
    当美帝国主义还没有遭受足够的致命打击的时候，它在朝鲜的侵略战争是不会中止的。为了争取朝鲜战争的胜利结束，必须给予美国的战争贩子以沉重再沉重的打击，使这些战争贩子知难而退。彭真指出：这是百余年来中国人民反帝国主义斗争和这次朝鲜战争所证明的一个真理。只有全世界人民一致起来给这些战争挑拨者，世界和平的破坏者，以致命的打击，才能制止新的世界战争，保卫世界的和平。
    彭真着重说明：为了争取抗美援朝的胜利结束，为了解放台湾，为了粉碎美帝国主义单独对日媾和、武装日本的计划，为了保卫我们祖国的安全，保卫远东与世界的和平，我们必须继续加强反对美国侵略，援助朝鲜人民军和中国志愿军的神圣运动。彭真最后号召全国人民为实现各民主党派各人民团体在纪念抗日战争胜利日六周年联合宣言中的主张而奋斗。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深发表讲话称：在六年前的东方战场上，中国人民军队长期抗击了二百万以上的日本侵略军，获得无数次辉煌战绩。苏联也始终在远东边境牵制了一百万日本精兵，并在一九四五年八月消灭了日本有名的关东军。中苏两国是东方对日作战的主力，在当时获取胜利中起了决定性的作用。正当我们纪念抗日战争胜利的时候，美英帝国主义发表所谓“对日和约草案”，排除中华人民共和国于对日作战国之外，撕毁了国际协定，妄想把六年来武装日本、威胁中苏及亚洲各国安全的行动变为“合法”。我们坚决反对美英非法对日媾和，加强抗美援朝工作，才是今天纪念抗战胜利的最好表现。我们要从速缴纳捐款，再接再厉地展开捐献武器的运动。我们在伟大毛泽东的旗帜下，为粉碎美英侵略战争计划、保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平而奋斗。
    中国民主同盟秘书长章伯钧在讲话中指出：美帝国主义发动朝鲜战争和制订片面和约，是全世界人民所反对的。美帝国主义把十年来各大国所订的协议都完全破坏了。它的前途一定是死亡。他说，我们更进一步地团结起来在毛主席的领导下，加强抗美援朝工作，为打倒美帝国主义而奋斗。
    民主建国会全国会务推进委员会召集人章乃器讲话称：今天的局势与抗日战争时期的局势已大大不同，大大有利于革命人民，美帝国主义虽比日本帝国主义更加凶恶更加狠毒，但是中国人民和全世界人民的力量已经无比的强大了。胜利一定是属于我们的。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一在讲话中号召全国工人进行爱国主义生产捐献运动，加强祖国的国防力量，保卫世界和平。他说：美帝国主义不顾中国人民和全世界人民的反对，单独对日媾和，重新武装日本。在朝鲜，它又用各种方法破坏谈判。我们全国人民应加强准备，提高警惕。他说：中国人民已经站起来了，反对美帝国主义的力量已经更加巩固起来，我们一定能够获得胜利。
    大会在高呼“抗日战争胜利万岁”、“中苏友好万岁”、“反对武装日本”、“反对美英对日和约”、“打倒美帝国主义”的口号后结束。（附图片）
