During World War II, Wang Jie, Wu Ziqing, Xu Fuquan, Qiu Tian, and 150 other returned overseas Chinese from Fujian, who led overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and local people of all ethnic groups in bravely resisting the Japanese fascist invasion, jointly wrote a letter to overseas Chinese and local peace-loving people in Southeast Asia on the eve of the "September 3rd" Victory Day of the Anti-Japanese War, calling on overseas Chinese and people of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia to unite and resolutely oppose the US separate peace treaty with Japan. Among these 150 returned overseas Chinese, Wang Jie was the former commander of the Overseas Chinese Detachment of the Anti-Japanese Army of the Philippines, Wu Ziqing was the former secretary-general of the Anti-Japanese Assassination Alliance of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines, Xu Fuquan was the former head of the Klang Port of the Anti-Japanese Alliance of Malaya, and Qiu Tian was the chief writer of the Anti-Japanese Pioneer Newspaper, which was published underground in Malaya during the Anti-Japanese War. There were also some commanders and fighters of the Anti-Japanese Army of the Philippines, commanders and fighters of the Anti-Japanese Army of Malaya and members of the Anti-Japanese Alliance, and anti-Japanese activists from Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and other places. The original letter is as follows:

Dear overseas Chinese compatriots, anti-Japanese comrades-in-arms, and peace-loving people in Southeast Asia: As we commemorate the Victory Day of the Anti-Japanese War on the flourishing land of our motherland, we cannot but recall your great contributions to the war against the Japanese fascist invasion. The fruits of victory we exchanged with hot blood and heads are not allowed to be seized by anyone. However, the US and British robbers are desperately robbing us. The one-sided draft peace treaty with Japan announced by the US and British governments and the so-called San Francisco Peace Treaty Conference forcibly convened on September 4th fully demonstrate that US-British imperialism completely disregards the contributions and sacrifices of the Asian people in the battle to defeat Japanese fascism, and attempts to wipe out all the rights of Asian countries on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. Their purpose is to rearm Japan and use the Japanese as cannon fodder to slaughter the Asian people again and suppress the national liberation movement of the Asian people. This is what we cannot tolerate and resolutely oppose.

Dear overseas Chinese compatriots and comrades-in-arms! We will not forget that in the early days of the Pacific War, the US and British troops fled and surrendered, and the entire Southeast Asia was ravaged by Japanese invaders. At this critical moment, the people and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia organized themselves under extremely difficult conditions and took up arms to persist in the arduous armed struggle against the Japanese invaders. On Luzon Island in the Philippines, the footprints of the Anti-Japanese Army were all over the island. The people's armed forces in Malaya, Vietnam, Myanmar, Indonesia and other places also established large anti-Japanese base areas, which effectively contained the Japanese invaders. Ironclad facts prove that without the heroic struggle of the people and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia at that time, it would have been impossible for the US and British troops to quickly switch to a counter-offensive in the Pacific!

We will never forget the massacre of the people and overseas Chinese in Malaya and the Philippines by "Tiger of Malaya" Yamashita Tomoyuki, in which more than 100,000 overseas Chinese compatriots were killed. The tragic scene of more than 200,000 people and overseas Chinese compatriots from Thailand, Malaya, Myanmar, and Vietnam dying on the "Death Railway" from Thailand to Myanmar, which was forcibly built by the Japanese invaders, is still fresh in our memory. Until now, Southeast Asia is still scarred and stained with blood. Who can forget this blood feud? Who can tolerate the rearmament of the cannibalistic Japanese warlords? Dear friends! Then, how can we prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism and safeguard world peace? Comrade Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, issued a statement on August 15th, advocating convening a comprehensive peace conference of representatives of all countries that participated in the war against Japan with troops to discuss the issue of a common peace treaty with Japan. The joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations in the country on September 2nd to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War further declared the clear attitude of the entire Chinese people. Let us, one billion Asian people, unite closely and strive for the realization of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan! Dear friends! The 475 million Chinese people who have stood up under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China are standing with you against the US-British separate peace treaty with Japan! The peace-loving people all over the world are on our side. The positions taken by the Soviet Union, India and Myanmar against the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan are welcomed by us all. We have the confidence to shatter any aggressive conspiracy of US-British imperialism. Your just struggle to eliminate all forms of enslavement for national liberation will always receive the support of the people of Asia!

    福建归国华侨联名致书东南亚各地人民与华侨
    号召加强团结反对美国单独对日媾和
    亚洲各国人民在抗日战争中的胜利果实，决不容美英帝国主义窃取
    【新华社福州三日电】在第二次世界大战期间曾领导东南亚各地华侨与当地各族人民共同英勇抗击日本法西斯侵略、现住福建的归国华侨王杰、吴紫清、许福全、邱天等一百五十人，在“九三”抗日战争胜利日前夕，联名写信给东南亚各地华侨和当地爱好和平的人民，号召东南亚各地华侨和各族人民团结起来，坚决反对美国单独对日媾和。这一百五十位归国华侨中，王杰是前坚决抗日的菲律宾民抗军华侨支队支队长，吴紫清是前菲律宾华侨抗日锄奸大同盟秘书长，许福全是前马来亚抗日同盟巴生港负责人，邱天是抗日期间马来亚地下出版的抗日先锋报主笔，还有一些是抗日的菲律宾民抗军的指战员，马来亚民抗军指战员与抗日同盟盟员，缅甸、越南及泰国、印度尼西亚等地抗日活动分子。原信如下：
    亲爱的东南亚各地华侨同胞、各族抗日战友和广大爱好和平的人民：当我们在欣欣向荣的祖国土地上纪念抗日战争胜利日的时候，我们不能不忆起你们在反抗日本法西斯侵略战争中所作的伟大贡献。我们洒热血、抛头颅而换来的胜利果实，是不容任何人窃取的。可是，美英强盗们却拚命在向我们进行劫夺。美英两国政府公布的片面对日和约草案和九月四日强行召开所谓旧金山对日和约会议，就十足说明美英帝国主义完全漠视亚洲人民击败日本法西斯的战斗中的贡献与牺牲，企图一笔抹煞亚洲各国在对日和约问题上的一切权利，其目的就是想重新武装日本，拿日本人作炮灰再来屠杀亚洲人民，镇压亚洲人民的民族解放运动。这是我们不能容忍并坚决反对的。
    亲爱的华侨同胞和战友们！我们不会忘记在太平洋战争初期，美英军队逃跑的逃跑了，投降的投降了，整个东南亚任日寇蹂躏。在这紧急关头，东南亚的人民与华侨在极端困难的条件下，组织了起来，拿起武器对日寇坚持了艰苦的武装斗争。菲律宾的吕宋岛上，踏遍了民抗军的足迹。马来亚和越南、缅甸、印度尼西亚等地人民武装，也建立了大片抗日根据地，有力地牵制了日寇兵力。铁的事实证明：在当时没有东南亚人民与华侨的英勇斗争，美英军队要在太平洋上迅速转入反攻，是根本不可能的！
    我们更不会忘记“马来之虎”山下奉文对马来亚、菲律宾人民与华侨的大屠杀，其中被害的华侨同胞就有十多万人。泰国、马来亚、缅甸、越南的人民与华侨同胞有二十多万死在日寇强迫建筑的泰国到缅甸的“死亡铁路”上的惨象，我们记忆犹新。直到现在，东南亚还疮痍满目，血迹斑斑，谁能忘记这血海深仇？谁能容忍吃人的野兽日本军阀再武装起来？亲爱的朋友们！那末，我们怎样来防止日本军国主义的再起、维护世界和平呢？我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长已于八月十五日发表声明，主张召开曾以军队参加对日战争的一切国家的代表的全面的和会，来商定共同对日和约问题。九月二日全国各民主党派各人民团体为纪念抗日战争胜利日六周年联合宣言更宣示了全中国人民的明确态度。让我们十亿亚洲人民紧密团结起来，为争取实现全面对日和约而奋斗吧！亲爱的朋友们！在毛泽东与中国共产党领导下的四亿七千五百万站起来了的中国人民，是与你们站在一起反对美英单独对日媾和的！全世界爱好和平的人民是站在我们这一方面的。苏联、印度和缅甸所采取的反对美英对日和约草案的立场是我们所共同欢迎的。我们有信心来粉碎美英帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋，你们为争取民族解放扫除一切奴役制度所进行的正义的斗争，是永远受到全亚洲人民的声援和支持的！
