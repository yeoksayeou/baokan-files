    Conducting Trade Work in Ethnic Minority Areas
    In the past two years, our country's trade work in ethnic minority areas, based on equality and mutual assistance, has gradually developed, and has begun to improve the production and living standards of ethnic minorities and strengthen the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country.
    Our great motherland is a multi-ethnic country. The relationship between the various ethnic groups in history, especially in recent decades, during the period of intensified imperialist aggression and the tyrannical rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, was one of disunity and even hostility. Many ethnic minorities were driven into the deep mountains, deserts, and grasslands. Under the cruel plunder and exploitation of internal and external reactionaries, the economic life of most ethnic minority people was extremely impoverished. The victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China have fundamentally changed the relationship between all ethnic groups in China, from the ethnic relations of oppression and being oppressed in the past to the relations of equality and mutual assistance; the policy of economic plunder and exploitation of ethnic minorities has been changed to a policy of helping ethnic minorities develop production and facilitate the flow of goods. In the past two years, the liberated ethnic minority areas, under the unified leadership of the local Chinese Communist Party organizations and the People's Government, have carried out various social reforms to varying degrees. Trade work in ethnic minority areas, especially state-owned trade work, has also made significant progress in coordination with various tasks.
    Judging only from the situation of state-owned trade, the changes in the trade situation in various ethnic minority areas are very significant. Since liberation, according to incomplete statistics, state-owned trade agencies have successively established 750 enterprises and institutions such as state-owned trade companies, retail departments, purchasing stations, consignment shops, and processing factories, as well as a large number of mobile trade teams in ethnic minority areas, which have absorbed approximately 1,700 trade work cadres from ethnic minorities. Under the guidance of the fair and reasonable price policy of state-owned trade, the exchange parity of goods in ethnic minority areas has undergone major changes. The prices of local and special products have increased, and the prices of imported daily necessities have decreased. For example, in 1947, one ton of grain in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region could only be exchanged for half a bolt of Wufu cloth, but in 1950 it could be exchanged for more than two and a half bolts, an increase of more than four times; in 1949, 200 kilograms of wool in Xinjiang could only be exchanged for one bolt of blue cloth, but in November 1950, only 30 kilograms of wool could be exchanged for one bolt of blue cloth, meaning the price of wool increased more than six times; before liberation, 100 jin of wool in Qinghai could only be exchanged for one and a half bricks of tea, but in 1950 it could be exchanged for twelve bricks of tea, an increase of eight times; in the Datian Miao area of Guizhou, before liberation, 100 jin of tung oil could only be exchanged for 23 jin of salt, but now it can be exchanged for 160 jin of salt, an increase of seven times. Now, the exchange parity in various places is gradually becoming fair and reasonable. Due to the changes in exchange parity, the purchasing power of ethnic minority people has greatly increased, their agricultural and pastoral production has been restored and developed, and their lives have been improved. Therefore, the people of ethnic minority areas generally warmly support and love Chairman Mao and the People's Government, and gratefully praise Chairman Mao as the "Red Sun" and the "True Living Buddha."
    The above achievements were made under the guidance of the correct ethnic policy of the Central People's Government, through the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party organizations and the People's Governments in various ethnic minority areas, and the great efforts of cadres at all levels, including ethnic minorities. However, these achievements are still far from enough. It is necessary to further actively carry out trade work in ethnic minority areas according to the urgent economic needs of the broad masses of ethnic minorities, and help them develop production and improve their lives.
    The summary of the First National Ethnic Trade Conference held in the capital in late August pointed out that in order to do a good job in trade with ethnic minorities, the following issues should be noted:
    First, it should be clearly recognized that trade work in ethnic minority areas is not only an economic task but also a political task. Originally, economic work cannot be carried out without political requirements. In history, the ethnic oppression implemented by reactionary rulers was, in essence, mainly economic exploitation and plunder; extremely unequal trade was a concrete manifestation of economic exploitation and plunder. In order to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the reactionary ethnic policies of the past, we should vigorously develop trade work in accordance with the ethnic policies of the Common Program, combined with the specific conditions of various ethnic groups and regions. Trade work in ethnic minority areas is a concrete manifestation of ethnic policy and an important political task. Especially on the long defense line where ethnic minorities in the southwest live, imperialists are using the gaps where our work in these areas has not been universally and deeply developed to conspire to carry out aggression in every possible way. Therefore, all trade workers in ethnic minority areas should also be good political workers and excellent quartermasters who work hard and wholeheartedly serve the people. Their task is to unite all ethnic minorities in the country more closely through economic and trade activities, so as to consolidate national defense and defend our great motherland from infringement.
    Second, state-owned trade organizations should be actively established and developed in ethnic minority areas. The organizational form of state-owned trade organizations should adopt various forms such as comprehensive subsidiaries, specialized companies, and mobile teams, according to the different conditions of various regions and ethnic groups, adapting to local conditions to suit the specific conditions at that time and place. In areas where it is possible to organize cooperatives, the development of cooperatives should be actively supported, and the commercial network in ethnic minority areas should be expanded to vigorously promote the local and special products of ethnic minorities and supply them with the means of livelihood and production that meet their needs.
    Third, under the leadership and organization of state-owned trade organizations, legitimate private merchants should be united to carry out trade in ethnic minority areas, and ethnic minority people should be helped to engage in commerce. Ethnic minority areas are vast and sparsely populated, and transportation is inconvenient. At present and for a considerable period in the future, it will be difficult to fully meet the requirements of ethnic minorities for exchanging materials by relying solely on the development of state-owned trade organizations. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to unite legitimate private merchants and help ethnic minority people engage in commerce. State-owned trade should help all ethnic minorities restore or establish regular markets, establish state-owned trade organizations or mobile teams in these markets, and implement market management to ensure that state-owned enterprises, private merchants, and people of all ethnic groups can conduct fair and reasonable exchanges in these markets and gradually improve the transaction system.
    Fourth, we should implement the price policy of taking into account both public and private interests, fairness and reasonableness, and adopt a method combining economic leadership and administrative management to resolutely prevent and oppose the economic plunder and deceptive behavior of some private merchants against ethnic minority people. Under normal circumstances, a correct price policy should take into account the reasonable interests of production, transportation, and sales. However, for ethnic minorities who are currently experiencing special difficulties in their lives, it is necessary to give special consideration to trade for a certain period of time in order to further help these ethnic minorities overcome difficulties, develop production, and restore their vitality. At the same time, we should, according to needs and possibilities, support the development of handicraft production with development prospects in ethnic minority areas and their surrounding areas, and reduce the difficulties in the supply of daily necessities caused by inconvenient transportation. In order to improve the quality of local and special products, in addition to implementing grade price differences, we should also organize on-site processing and packaging to reduce freight and consolidate and expand sales channels.
    Fifth, we should actively train and cultivate ethnic minority trade cadres, which is the central link in carrying out trade work in ethnic minority areas. Trade cadre schools in major administrative regions should set up special training classes for ethnic minority cadres. State-owned trade organizations in ethnic minority areas should absorb a large number of ethnic minority cadres and adopt the method of learning in work to gradually improve their political, professional, and cultural levels.
    The guidelines of the National Ethnic Trade Conference are correct. This conference pointed out an infinitely bright future for trade work in ethnic minority areas. It is hoped that people of all ethnic groups will unite, overcome difficulties, and strive to further develop ethnic trade and develop the economy of ethnic minorities!

    开展少数民族地区的贸易工作
    近两年间，我国少数民族地区平等互助的贸易工作逐步开展，已经开始提高了少数民族的生产与生活水平，增强了全国各民族的大团结。
    我们伟大的祖国是一个多民族的国家；各民族之间的关系，在历史上，特别是在近几十年间，在帝国主义加紧侵略和国民党反动派横暴统治的时代，是不团结的，甚至是互相仇视的。许多少数民族被赶到深山、沙漠和草原。在内外反动派残酷地掠夺与剥削下，大部分少数民族人民的经济生活是极端贫困的。中国人民民主革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，使中国各民族之间的关系发生了根本的变化，从过去压迫和被压迫的民族关系改变为平等、互助的关系；从经济上对少数民族进行掠夺与剥削的政策改变为帮助少数民族发展生产、物畅其流的政策。在过去两年间，解放了的少数民族地区在当地中国共产党的组织和人民政府的统一领导下进行了各种不同程度的社会改革。少数民族地区的贸易工作，特别是国营贸易工作，也配合着各种工作有了显著的发展。
    仅从国营贸易的情况来看，各少数民族地区的贸易情况的变化是很大的。自解放以来，据不完全统计，国营贸易机关已先后在少数民族地区设置了国营贸易公司、门市部、采购站、代销店、加工厂等七百五十个企业机构和大批流动贸易小组，其中吸收了少数民族的贸易工作干部约一千七百多人。在国营贸易的公平合理的价格政策的指导下，少数民族地区商品的交换比价，已经发生了重大的变化。土产特产的价格提高了，外来的日用必需品的价格降低了。例如：一九四七年内蒙古自治区一吨粮食只能换到半疋五福布，一九五○年已可换到二疋半多，增加了四倍多；一九四九年新疆二百公斤羊毛只能换到一疋青布，一九五○年十一月只要三十公斤羊毛就可以换到一疋青布了，就是羊毛价涨了六倍多；青海解放前一百斤羊毛只换一块半砖茶，一九五○年可以换十二块砖茶了，增加了八倍；贵州大定苗族区在解放前一百斤桐油只能换二十三斤食盐，现在可换一百六十斤食盐，增加了七倍。现在，各地的交换比价逐渐趋于公平合理。由于交换比价的变化，大大提高了少数民族人民的购买力，恢复和发展了他们的农牧业生产，改善了他们的生活。因此，少数民族地区人民普遍对毛主席和人民政府热烈地拥护和爱戴，感激地称颂毛主席为“红太阳”，“真正的活佛”。
    以上这些成绩是在中央人民政府正确的民族政策指导下，经过各少数民族地区中国共产党的组织和人民政府统一领导，和包括少数民族在内的各级干部极大的努力取得的。但是这些成绩还是很不够的。必须按照少数民族广大群众在经济上的迫切要求，进一步积极开展少数民族地区的贸易工作，帮助他们发展生产、改善生活。
    八月下旬在首都举行的第一次全国民族贸易会议的总结，指出了为要作好对少数民族的贸易工作，应注意以下各项问题：
    首先，应该明确认识到，少数民族地区的贸易工作，不但是经济任务，而且是政治任务。本来经济工作就是不能离开政治要求来进行的。历史上反动统治者所实施的民族压迫，其实质的一个主要方面就是经济的剥削和掠夺；极端的不等价贸易便是经济剥削和掠夺的具体表现。我们为坚决、彻底肃清历史上的反动的民族政策，应该根据共同纲领的民族政策，结合各民族各地区的具体情况，大力展开贸易工作。在少数民族地区的贸易工作是民族政策的具体表现，是重要的政治任务。特别在西南少数民族居住的漫长的国防线上，帝国主义者利用我们在这些地区的工作还未普遍深入展开的空隙，正千方百计地阴谋进行侵略。因此，所有在少数民族地区的贸易工作者，同时应该是很好的政治工作者，是一个艰苦奋斗的全心全意为人民服务的优秀勤务员。他们的任务是通过经济和贸易活动，把全国少数民族更亲密地团结起来，以巩固国防，保卫我们伟大的祖国不受侵犯。
    第二，应当在少数民族地区积极地建立和发展国营贸易机构。国营贸易机构的组织形式，应当根据各地区各民族的不同情况，采取一揽子公司、专业公司、流动小组等各种形式，因地制宜，以适合于当时当地的具体情况。在有条件组织合作社的地区，应积极扶助合作社的发展，并扩大少数民族地区的商业网，大力推销少数民族的土产特产，供给合乎他们需要的生活资料和生产资料。
    第三，应在国营贸易机构的领导和组织下，团结正当私商，进行少数民族地区的贸易，并帮助少数民族人民经营商业。少数民族地区地广人稀，交通不便，目前以及以后相当长时期内，单靠国营贸易机构的发展，还难完全满足少数民族交换物资的要求。因此，团结正当私商，帮助少数民族人民经营商业是完全必要的。国营贸易应当帮助各少数民族恢复或建立定期的集市，在这些市场上建立国营贸易机构或流动小组，并施行市场管理，以保证国营企业、私商和各族人民在这些市场上进行公平合理的交换，逐渐改进交易制度。
    第四，应贯彻公私兼顾、公平合理的价格政策，采取经济领导和行政管理相结合的方法，坚决防止和反对某些私商对少数民族人民的经济掠夺和欺骗行为。在一般情况下，正确的价格政策，应当照顾产、运、销三方面的合理利益。但对目前在生活上尚有特殊困难的少数民族，在一定时期内在贸易上有必要加以特别照顾，以便进一步帮助这些少数民族克服困难，发展生产，恢复元气。同时，应根据需要和可能，扶植少数民族地区及其附近地区有发展前途的手工业生产，减少因交通不便而发生的日用必需品供应的困难。为提高土产特产的质量，除实行品级差价外，并应组织就地加工整装，以减轻运费和巩固扩大销路。
    第五，应积极训练和培养少数民族贸易干部，这是开展少数民族地区贸易工作的中心环节。各大行政区贸易干部学校，应为少数民族干部开办专门训练班。在少数民族地区的国营贸易机构应大量吸收少数民族干部，采取在工作中学习的培养方法，逐渐提高他们的政治、业务和文化水平。
    民族贸易会议的这些方针是正确的。这次会议为少数民族地区的贸易工作指出了无限光明的前途。希望各族人民团结一致，克服困难，为进一步开展民族贸易，发展少数民族的经济而奋斗！
