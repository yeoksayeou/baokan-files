Henan Xuchang Special District State-Owned Trading Company
Massively Purchases Tobacco Leaves to Guarantee Tobacco Farmers' Interests
Many Tobacco Farmers Complete Donation Plans After Selling Tobacco

    With new tobacco from Xuchang on the market, the Henan Provincial State-Owned Tobacco Company is vigorously purchasing in coordination with cooperatives. New tobacco in various parts of Xuchang Special District has been on the market in large quantities since early September. The daily amount of tobacco on the market in the five major tobacco markets of Xuchang, Jia County, Yu County, Changge, and Xiangcheng is about 350,000 jin. The Henan Provincial People's Government's industrial and commercial departments and state-owned tobacco companies have vigorously publicized the tobacco-grain price ratio policy, established tobacco purchasing agencies in various tobacco-producing areas, made large-scale purchases, and entrusted local cooperatives and private tobacco firms to purchase on their behalf. Tobacco Management Committees have been established in various county and city market towns to grasp unified tobacco grading standards and implement the price ratio policy in tobacco purchasing. Under the leadership of the People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce, private tobacco firms in various places have formed inspection teams to inspect each other's policy implementation, effectively eliminating various malpractices and guaranteeing the interests of tobacco farmers.

    Various state-owned trading companies and cooperatives supply tobacco farmers with large quantities of materials when purchasing tobacco. Various state-owned trading companies have established linked operations with state-owned tobacco companies, established joint stores in cities and market towns, and organized purchasing and sales teams in rural areas to purchase tobacco while promoting the sales of grain and industrial products. Tobacco farmers can immediately exchange what they need after selling tobacco.

    The above measures taken by the People's Government have effectively guaranteed the implementation of the tobacco-grain price ratio policy. It is estimated that this year, the income per mu of tobacco fields for farmers in Xuchang Special District will be roughly equivalent to the income from two to three mu of grain crops. Many tobacco farmers immediately completed their donation plans after selling tobacco. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河南许昌专区国营贸易公司
    大量收购菸叶保障菸农利益
    许多菸农卖菸后完成捐献计划
    许昌新菸上市，河南省国营菸草公司正在合作社配合下大力收购中。许昌专区各地新菸九月初就已大量上市；许昌、郏县、禹县、长葛、襄城等五个主要菸草市场每日上市量都在三十五万斤左右。河南省人民政府工商部门和公营菸草公司大力宣传了菸粮比价政策，在各产菸区建立了收菸机构，大量收购，并委托当地合作社及私人菸行代购。各县市集镇都成立了菸草管理委员会，在收菸中掌握统一的菸草等级标准及贯彻比价政策。各地私营菸行在人民政府工商局领导下，纷纷组成检查小组，互相检查政策执行情形，有效地杜绝了各种陋规流弊，保障了菸农的利益。
    各种国营贸易公司和合作社在收购菸草时，都以大量物资供应菸农。各国营贸易公司都和国营菸草公司建立连环业务，并在城市、集镇设立联合商店，在乡村组织收购推销小组，一面收购菸草，一面推销粮食和工业品。菸农卖菸后可以马上换到他们需要的东西。
    人民政府以上各种措施有效地保障了菸粮比价政策的贯彻。估计今年许昌专区农民每亩菸田的收益，大约可抵两三亩粮食作物的收益。许多菸农卖菸后立即完成了他们的捐献计划。（新华社）
