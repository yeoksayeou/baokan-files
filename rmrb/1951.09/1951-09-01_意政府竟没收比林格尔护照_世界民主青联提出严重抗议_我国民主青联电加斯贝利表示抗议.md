Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 31st: The passport of Billingue, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and Chairman of the International Committee of the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival, was confiscated by the Italian authorities when he returned to Italy after the festival. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth issued a statement on this matter and lodged a strong protest with the Italian Gasperi government.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, protesting the unreasonable measure of the Italian government in confiscating the passport of Billingue, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The text of the telegram is as follows: To Prime Minister Gasperi of the Italian Government,
    Chinese youth have learned with anger of the Italian government's confiscation of the passport of Billingue, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and Chairman of the Berlin Festival. This reactionary measure by your government once again proves that you are determined to violate the will of all peace-loving and just youth in Italy and the world, and are willing to serve as loyal lackeys of the US imperialist plot to launch a new war and persecute the freedom and rights of youth. But the struggle of youth around the world to defend peace will never weaken because of this, it will only develop and grow stronger. This Federation, on behalf of all Chinese youth, lodges a serious protest with you and the Italian government, and demands the immediate revocation of this unreasonable measure and the restoration of Billingue's freedom to enter and leave the country to carry out his duties for the World Federation of Democratic Youth.
                     All-China Federation of Democratic Youth

    【新华社三十一日讯】柏林消息：世界民主青年联盟主席、第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节国际委员会主席比林格尔在联欢节结束后返回意大利时，护照被意大利当局没收。世界青联书记处为此事发表声明，并向意大利加斯贝利政府提出严重抗议。
    【新华社三十一日讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会致电意大利总理加斯贝利，抗议意政府没收世界民主青年联盟主席比林格尔护照的无理措施。电文如下：意大利政府加斯贝利总理
    中国青年以愤怒的心情，获悉意大利政府没收世界民主青年联盟主席及本届柏林联欢节主席比林格尔护照的消息。你的政府这一反动措施，再一次证明你们决心违背全意大利及全世界一切爱好和平正义青年的意志，甘愿充当美帝国主义发动新战争阴谋、迫害青年自由权利的忠实仆从。但全世界青年保卫和平的斗争，绝不会因此而减弱，它只会更加发展壮大。本会代表全中国青年向你及意大利政府提出严重的抗议，并要求立即撤销这个无理措施，恢复比林格尔进出国境执行世界青联职务的自由。
