Economic Prosperity Under American Enslavement of Japan Is Impossible
Zhuang Tao
   The illegal San Francisco Conference, manipulated single-handedly by the United States, passed the American-made Treaty of Peace with Japan on September 8. Simultaneously, just hours after the signing of this treaty, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson and Japanese puppet Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida signed the so-called "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" in San Francisco, which allows U.S. troops to continue stationing in Japan. The Japanese people universally expressed dissatisfaction and opposition to this ugly farce staged by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to sell out the Japanese nation. The broad masses of the people expressed their protest with silence. According to a China News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th: "The Japanese people today calmly welcomed the signing of the treaty that formally ended the state of war, without showing fanaticism." Fearing that the people would hold demonstrations, the Yoshida government hastily canceled the scheduled "grand rally and lantern parade" on the 9th. In Osaka and other places, leaflets and slogans against the signing of the traitorous treaty appeared on the same day. This sentiment of dissatisfaction and opposition to the U.S. unilateral peace treaty with Japan, which is widely spreading among the Japanese people, is very natural. From their long-term personal experience after the war, especially from the experience of the past year since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Japanese people have already seen what the U.S. unilateral peace treaty with Japan will bring them.

   In the six years since the victorious end of the Second World Anti-Fascist War, Japan under American occupation has been moving towards a new war and becoming a colony day by day; it is also a process of the Japanese people's heroic struggle against hunger and for independence, democracy, and peace. In the past six years, the U.S. imperialist policy of turning Japan into its military base and colony has dragged Japan to the brink of destruction. In order to turn Japan into its tool for aggression against Asia and a market for dumping U.S. surplus goods and capital, the United States, from the time MacArthur began stationed in Japan, did not intend to thoroughly transform the Japanese economic structure, which was deeply dependent on war and overseas markets formed in the long-term war of aggression, and the Japanese fascist political system based on this economic foundation. On the contrary, after the United States initially completed its control over Japan, it immediately tried to restore Japan's war economy and cut off Japan's economic ties with Asia, making it a U.S. Far East factory, while reviving Japan's fascist system. This tendency has become more and more serious in the year since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, and the disasters it has brought to the Japanese nation have become more and more serious.

   The U.S. war of aggression against Korea in the past year has seemingly improved the Japanese economic panic, which was in a desperate situation due to the U.S. implementation of its aggressive policy at the beginning of last year, showing signs of false prosperity. In the year from June 25 last year to June 17 this year, special military orders issued to Japan by the U.S. military for its aggression against Korea reached 315 million U.S. dollars. The total amount of Japan's export trade in the past year has also reached 820 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 60 percent compared to the previous year, setting a record high for Japan's export trade after the war. With the increase in this "special demand" and the expansion of exports, from June last year to April this year, the comprehensive index of Japan's industrial and mining production has also increased significantly, from 93.6 percent of the average index from 1932 to 1936 to 132.3 percent, an increase of 41.4 percent compared to June last year. Therefore, the prices of Japanese general stocks have also risen, with the total stock price index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rising by about 50 percent in the year from June last year to June this year. However, despite these seemingly prosperous signs, not only are the Japanese working people living a poorer life than before the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, but many Japanese capitalists are also entangled in deep distress. Because behind this superficial prosperity, there are also more profound crises brewing that will lead the Japanese economy to a dead end.

   The superficial prosperity of the Japanese economy since the U.S. war of aggression against Korea is primarily due to the "special demand" of the U.S. aggression against Korea and the extremely abnormal opportunity created for Japan by the fact that countries in the world capitalist camp are expanding their armaments, reducing exports on the one hand, and rushing to purchase various necessary materials on the other. This is what Kazuo Kato, president of the Japan Diamond Magazine, said: "The pillar of Japan's economic recovery is first 'special demand,' and second, the surge in overseas demand for Japanese goods, which is in any case linked to international arms expansion." (Note 1) This means that the superficial prosperity of the Japanese economy since the U.S. war of aggression against Korea has further deepened the inherent contradiction of the Japanese economy, that is, its dependence on the war of aggression and overseas markets, and deepened the fragility of the Japanese economy as a foreign raw material processing trade. Therefore, any change in the imperialist war of aggression and overseas markets will inevitably have a major impact on the Japanese economy first. Since last year, the surge in raw material prices caused by the scramble for arms expansion in the world capitalist camp, such as the 53 percent increase in U.S. raw material prices in the ten months from June last year to March this year, has had a great impact on Japanese prices.

   Secondly, the superficial prosperity of the Japanese economy in the past year has also been built on the basis of compressing domestic demand. In order to supply the needs of the U.S. war of aggression against Korea and the expansion of armaments by overseas capitalist countries, the production of domestic consumer goods in Japan has been forced to decrease. For example, from June to September last year, the production of domestic trucks for self-use in Japan decreased from 1,363 vehicles per month to 810 vehicles; in 1950, the distribution of civilian cotton yarn in Japan was also reduced from the planned 140 million pounds to 80 million pounds, that is, less than one pound per person per year on average, which is only less than one-tenth of the total amount of civilian cotton yarn in Japan in 1937 (Note 2), causing a shortage of materials in Japan. On the other hand, since last year, the Japanese government has increased huge expenditures to increase the number of police reserve forces by 75,000, the Maritime Safety Agency by 8,000, and other strengthening of police armaments, which has promoted inflation. In the year from June last year to May this year, the amount of currency issued by the Bank of Japan increased from 300.4 billion yen to 395.1 billion yen, an expansion of nearly one-third.

   As mentioned above, the impact of world market prices, mainly U.S. prices, the shortage of materials caused by "special demand" suppressing domestic demand, and the increase in national fiscal expenditures have greatly promoted the rise in Japanese prices during the year. According to a survey by the Japan Economic Stabilization Board, the comprehensive price index in Japan in May this year has increased by 74 percent compared to June last year, and the black market price index in the same period has increased by 88 percent [Note 3], the degree of surge is higher than in other capitalist countries. Taking the wholesale price index as an example, from June last year to May this year, Japan rose by 48 percent, the United States rose by 16 percent, and the United Kingdom, which has a relatively fragile economic base, rose by only 20 percent. As a result, it further deprived the purchasing power of the Japanese people and reduced their living standards. According to the July issue of the Japan Industrial and Labor Monthly Report, Japanese consumer goods increased by an average of 50 percent from June last year to June this year, while wages only increased by an average of 9 percent. Even the Japanese government had to admit in its fifth economic white paper published on July 13 that the consumption level of urban citizens has decreased by 5 percent compared to before the war of aggression against Korea. The aforementioned soaring rate of consumer goods is much lower than that of means of production, which also shows that the Japanese people are generally losing their purchasing power. On the other hand, the working conditions of Japanese workers are getting worse and worse. According to the fifth economic white paper of the Japanese government: "The level of industrial production has increased by about 50 percent from April last year to April this year, while the amount of workers employed has only increased by 5.8 percent." This shows that while the standard of living is declining, workers' working hours and labor intensity have been forced to further lengthen and increase.

   The deterioration of the lives of the Japanese people, and the further shrinking of the domestic market in Japan formed with the deterioration of the lives of the Japanese people, in turn, has further deepened the dependence of the Japanese economy on the war of aggression and overseas markets, and has also further deepened the fragility of the Japanese economy. Since the beginning of this year, due to the failure of the United States in the war of aggression against Korea, and the reduction of imports of certain materials by various capitalist countries in the world after a period of panic buying, the Japanese economy has shown some dangers. Since March this year, Japan's monthly exports have begun to decline, and by June, they have fallen from 180 million U.S. dollars in March to 94 million U.S. dollars, a decrease of nearly half. According to the Diamond Magazine in late June this year, industrial and mining production has entered a state of stagnation since April this year, and prices have also fallen. On June 8 this year, the average price index of the four major cities in Japan fell by 11 percent compared to April 12. Among them, the most prominent is the plunge in the price of textile products. On March 6, the settlement price of rayon in Tokyo was 516 yen, which plummeted by 30 percent by late April, and further fell to 290 yen by mid-June, only 56 percent of the price in early March.

    This extremely fragile performance of the Japanese economy is by no means accidental. As the Japan Toyo Keizai Shinpo said in its article "Confusion and Shaking Are Inevitable" on July 14: "It is a matter of course that the Japanese economy, which has improved by relying on turmoil (referring to the war of aggression against Korea - translator's note) and the expansion of armaments by foreign countries, will produce violent shaking if the peace movement rises." Therefore, even Koichi Katsumada, chairman of the Policy Deliberation Council of the Japanese Socialist Party, could not help but see: "The stability of industry is related to the stability of the people's lives. If we engage in military-related processing industries that import raw materials from foreign countries and export military-related products to foreign countries, then even if we may be able to achieve stability for a certain period, labor time and living standards will immediately become a problem. At this time, if we take the method of extending labor time and freezing living standards, the Japanese economy cannot achieve stability." [Note 4]

   In the past year of the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, the United States has tried to cut off Japan's economic ties with Asia and make it a U.S. Far East factory, which has further deepened Japan's economic crisis. Since December last year, the United States has cut off Japan's economic ties with China and forced Japan to purchase U.S. raw materials; at the same time, the United States has restricted the export of certain raw materials to expand its armaments, causing a panic of raw materials and a deformed phenomenon of expensive raw materials and cheap products since the war of aggression against Korea, bringing serious difficulties to the Japanese economy. In the past year, Japan's import amount of metal minerals, raw coal, and salt was reduced by 65 percent compared to the previous year. For example, Japan originally planned to import 2 million tons of iron ore last year, but only imported 1.6 million tons as a result.

   At the same time, the surge in U.S. prices and freight rates since the war of aggression against Korea has also caused serious problems in the cost of Japanese industrial production. According to the Diamond Magazine in mid-July, coking coal, which cost 16 U.S. dollars per ton in July last year, has risen to 30 U.S. dollars in May this year. This price is three times that of Kailuan coal. However, the United States also forced Japan to supply cheap products at the same time. On May 16 this year, General Marquette, director of the Economic and Scientific Bureau of the Ridgway Headquarters, issued a so-called statement on "U.S.-Japan Economic Cooperation," in which he began by saying: Japan will receive orders from the United States, but the prices must be based on international competition. This means that the price of Japanese industrial products must not exceed the international market price. But what is the reality? In June this year, the cost of each ton of steel bars in Japan has reached 45,000 yen, while the market price in the United States in the same period was 29,400 yen [Note 5], only two-thirds of the cost of Japanese steel bars. Since the war of aggression against Korea, Japanese industry has been losing its competitiveness due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials and the high prices. Therefore, Japanese bourgeois economist Sohachiro Kimura complained when talking about the price issue related to "U.S.-Japan Economic Cooperation": "The prerequisite for accepting orders is to lower prices, but the reason why the prices of Japanese goods are so high is that there are really helpless reasons. It is neither because wages are high nor because capitalists are greedy for huge profits... It is no longer possible to lower wages in Japan... Specifically, the first is that raw materials are expensive and freight rates are high, which are problems that Japan is unable to solve." [Note 6] Japanese bourgeois political commentator Akio Daidoji said more in his article "Contradictions in Japanese Internal Affairs": "The military-related industry faces such a contradiction: originally, once a war breaks out, everything will be fine, but now it is suffering because of the war." [Note 7]

   The above-mentioned deepening of the Japanese economic crisis in the past year of the U.S. war of aggression against Korea is inseparable from Japan's increasing involvement in the war of aggression and Japan's increasing status as a part under U.S. rule. Today's Japan has become a concentration camp for U.S. military-related processing and production in economic terms. Based on the situation in the past year, it is not difficult to see that the U.S. unilateral peace treaty with Japan will inevitably bring more serious disasters to Japan.

   The purpose of the U.S. unilateral peace treaty with Japan is to realize the conspiracy of legally and relatively large-scale arming Japan, so as to use Japan's manpower and material resources as its tool for attacking the Asian people. This is to drag Japan deeper into the whirlpool of war and further make Japan a vassal of the United States, and the result will bring a fate of destruction to Japan, not prosperity. The road that Japan has traveled in the past year has eloquently confirmed this point, and many people in the Japanese ruling class have also clearly understood this point. Koichi Katsumada said: "Japan, which relies on foreign countries for 25 percent of its food, 70 percent of its industrial raw materials, and 80 percent of its ships, will be enough to destroy Japan once it participates in the war. It is as clear as a torch." "If Japan enters the whirlpool of world opposition, it will form a situation of taking chestnuts from the fire. This situation of taking chestnuts from the fire is the most worrying. Even if it may be possible to obtain temporary prosperity, it will inevitably lead to great difficulties after being completely involved in the whirlpool." [Note 8]

   This practice of U.S. imperialism in Japan is incompatible with the basic interests of the entire Japanese nation. The war of aggression carried out by the Japanese landlords and big bourgeoisie for a long time has brought great disasters to the Japanese people, and has inevitably formed the final defeat of Japanese imperialism in the Second World Anti-Fascist War. Due to the victory of the world people's anti-fascist war, the Japanese people gained the possibility of liberation and the Japanese nation gained the opportunity for new life. At that time, what the Japanese people urgently demanded was to thoroughly eliminate the feudal remnants in the countryside, improve the lives of workers, and shift the Japanese economy to serve the broad masses of the people in the country; at the same time, eliminate the fascist remnants, establish a democratic government, and ensure the implementation of various policies that would allow the Japanese nation to obtain a new life. However, the actions of the United States in Japan in the past six years have completely run counter to the demands of the entire Japanese nation, dragging Japan back onto the old road of war and destruction. In order to resist the enslavement and exploitation of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese people, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, have persisted in an unyielding struggle for the past six years. Although this struggle has been constantly subjected to the tyrannical suppression of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, its momentum is increasing day by day. We believe that as long as the fundamental contradiction between U.S. imperialism and the entire Japanese nation cannot be resolved, and Japan cannot achieve independence, democracy, peace, and prosperity for a single day, the Japanese people will not stop fighting for a single day, and any suppression by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries will fail.

    美国奴役下的日本不可能有经济的繁荣
    庄涛
   美国一手包办的非法的旧金山会议，于九月八日通过了美制对日和约。同时，就在这一和约签字以后数小时，美国国务卿艾奇逊与日本傀儡首相吉田茂，又在旧金山签订了使美军继续留驻日本的所谓“美日安全协定”。日本人民对于美日反动派串演的这场妄图出卖日本民族的丑剧，普遍表现不满与反对。广大人民用沉默来表示他们的抗议。据国新社东京九日电：“日本人民今天冷静地欢迎正式结束战争状态的和约的签订，没有表现狂热。”由于害怕人民举行示威，吉田政府于九日临时仓促地取消了预定的“盛大集会与提灯游行”。在大阪等地，当天更出现了反对签订卖国条约的传单与标语。广泛地传布在日本人民中间的这种不满与反对美国单独对日媾和的情绪，是很自然的。日本人民从战后长期来的亲身体验中，特别是从美国发动侵朝战争的一年来的体验中，已经看到美国单独对日媾和将给他们带来什么。
   第二次世界反法西斯战争胜利结束以后的六年来，在美国占领下的日本，是一天天走向新的战争与殖民地的过程；也是日本人民为反对饥饿，争取独立、民主与和平而英勇斗争的过程。六年来美国帝国主义所执行的变日本为其军事基地与殖民地的政策，把日本拖上了毁灭的边沿。美国为了把日本变成它侵略亚洲的工具，以及推销美国过剩商品与资本的市场，从麦克阿瑟开始进驻日本的时候起，就没有打算彻底改造在长期侵略战争中形成的、深刻地依赖于战争与海外市场的日本经济结构，以及建立在这一经济基础之上的日本法西斯政治体制。相反的，当美国初步地完成了对日本的控制以后，即力谋恢复日本的战争经济，并切断日本经济与亚洲的联系，使之成为美国的远东工厂，同时复活日本的法西斯体制。这一倾向在美国发动侵朝战争的一年来，是越来越厉害了，而它带给日本民族的灾难也就越来越深重。
   美国发动侵略朝鲜战争的一年来，使由于去年初因美国实施侵略政策而陷于绝境的日本经济恐慌，似乎获得了表面的好转，显露出虚假繁荣的气象。从去年六月二十五日到今年六月十七日的一年间，美军为侵略朝鲜而向日本发出的特殊军需订货，已达三亿一千五百万美元。去年一年间日本的输出贸易总额，也已达到八亿二千万美元，比前年增加百分之六十，创战后日本输出贸易的最高纪录。在这一“特需”增加与输出扩大的情况下，从去年六月到今年四月的十个月间，日本工矿业生产的综合指数，也有显著上升，由达到一九三二至一九三六年平均指数底百分之九十三点六升至百分之一百三十二点三，比去年六月上升百分之四十一点四。因此日本一般股票的价格也随着上涨，从去年六月到今年六月的一年间，东京股票交易所的股票价格总指数，上涨百分之五十左右。然而，尽管有这些似乎繁荣的气象，不仅日本劳动人民过着比美国侵朝战争以前更为穷困的生活，就是日本很多资本家，也都被纠缠在深刻的苦恼中。因为就在这一表面繁荣的后面，同时孕育着使日本经济走上绝路的更为深刻的危机。
   美国侵朝战争以来日本经济的表面繁荣，首先是由于美国侵略朝鲜的“特需”，以及世界资本主义阵营各国为了扩张军备，一面减少输出，一面又急于购进各种必需物资而为日本造成了一个极不正常的机会。这就是日本金钢钻杂志社社长加藤一所说的：“日本恢复经济景气的支柱，第一是‘特需’，第二是海外对日本商品的需要激增，无论如何是和国际间的扩张军备结合着的。”（注一）这也就是说，美国侵朝战争以来日本经济的表面繁荣，已更加深了日本经济的固有矛盾，即对侵略战争与海外市场的依赖，加深了作为外国原料加工贸易的日本经济的脆弱性。所以帝国主义的侵略战争与海外市场的任何变动，必首先给日本经济以重大影响。去年以来因世界资本主义阵营竞相扩张军备而引起的原料价格暴腾，例如美国原料价格从去年六月到今年三月的十个月间，上涨百分之五十三，就给日本的物价以极大冲击。
   其次，一年来日本经济的表面繁荣，又是建立在压缩民需的基础之上的。为了供应美国侵朝战争与海外资本主义国家扩张军备的需要，日本国内民需品的生产已被迫降低。例如从去年六月到九月，日本国内自用卡车的生产，由月产一千三百六十三辆减至八百十辆；一九五○年日本国内民用棉纱的分配，也由预定的一亿四千万磅减至八千万磅，即每人每年平均不到一磅，这个数额只有一九三七年日本国内民用棉纱总量的十分之一以下（注二），造成日本国内物资的缺乏。另一方面，去年以来，日本国库为增设七万五千名警察后备队、八千名海上保安队与其他加强警察武装等而增加了巨额开支，促进了通货膨胀。从去年六月到今年五月的一年间，日本银行的通货发行额，由三千零四亿日元增至三千九百五十一亿日元，膨胀将近三分之一。
   如上所述，世界市场物价的影响，主要是美国物价的影响，因“特需”压迫民需而形成的物资缺乏，与国家财政开支的增加，便大大地推进了这一年间日本物价的上涨。据日本经济安定本部的调查，今年五月日本的综合物价指数，已比去年六月上升百分之七十四，同期黑市物价指数更上升百分之八十八〔注三〕，其狂涨程度在其他资本主义国家之上。以批发物价指数来说，从去年六月到今年五月，日本上升百分之四十八，美国上升百分之十六，经济基础相当脆弱的英国也不过上升百分之二十。其结果进一步剥夺了日本人民的购买力，降低了日本人民的生活水准。据七月号日本产业劳动月报所载，日本消费资料从去年六月到今年六月平均上涨百分之五十，而工资仅平均上升百分之九。就是日本政府在七月十三日发表的第五次经济白皮书上，也不得不承认城市市民的消费水准已比侵朝战争以前降低百分之五。上述消费资料的腾贵率远较生产资料为低，也说明日本人民普遍地丧失着购买能力。而另一方面，日本工人的劳动条件却越来越恶化。据日本政府的第五次经济白皮书所载：“工业生产水准从去年四月到今年四月约上升百分之五十左右，而工人的雇用量仅增加百分之五点八。”这里说明与生活水准下降同时，工人的劳动时间与劳动强度已被迫进一步延长与提高。
   日本人民生活的恶化，以及随着日本人民生活恶化而形成的日本国内市场的进一步缩小，反过来又更加深了日本经济对侵略战争与海外市场的依赖，也就更加深着日本经济的脆弱性。今年以来，由于美国在侵朝战争中的失利，与世界资本主义各国经过一个时期的抢购物资以后，减少了对某些物资的输入，已使日本经济显露了某些险象。从今年三月起，日本每月的输出量已开始下跌，到六月份，已由三月份的一亿八千万美元降至九千四百万美元，减少将及一半。据今年六月下旬号金钢钻杂志所载，今年四月以后，工矿业生产已转入停滞状态，物价也有下落现象。今年六月八日，日本四大都市的物价平均指数已较四月十二日下跌百分之十一。其中表现最突出的是纤维品价格的暴跌。三月六日东京人造丝结算价格为五百十六日元，到四月下旬暴跌百分之三十，到六月中旬更降至二百九十日元，仅及三月上旬价格的百分之五十六。
    日本经济的这一极度脆弱的表现，完全不是偶然的。正如七月十四日日本东洋经济新报在“混乱与动摇是不可避免的”一文中所说的：“依靠动乱（指侵朝战争——笔者）及外国扩张军备而好转的日本经济，如果和平运动抬头，便会产生剧烈的动摇是当然的事。”因此，就是日本社会党政策审议会会长胜间田清一，也不能不看到：“产业的稳定是和国民生活的稳定关联着的，如果进行从外国输入原料又向外国输出军需品的军需品加工工业，那么即使在某一时期说不定可能获得稳定，但劳动时间与生活水准便立刻成了问题，这时如果采取延长劳动时间与冻结生活水准的办法，日本经济是不可能获得稳定的。”〔注四〕
   美国在侵朝战争一年来，力图切断日本经济与亚洲的联系，而使之成为美国的远东工厂，这也使日本的经济危机进一步加深。去年十二月以来，美国切断了日本经济与中国的联系，强制日本购买美国的原料；同时美国为扩张军备又限制某些原料的输出，造成侵朝战争以来日本原料的恐慌与原料贵、产品贱的畸形现象，给日本经济带来了严重的困难。去年一年间，日本关于金属矿物、原料煤与盐三者的输入金额，要比前年减低百分之六十五。如去年度日本本预定输入铁矿石二百万吨，结果仅输入一百六十万吨。
   同时，侵朝战争以来美国物价与运费的暴涨，又使日本工业生产的成本发生严重问题。据七月中旬金钢钻杂志所载，去年七月每吨十六美元的炼焦用煤，到今年五月已涨至三十美元。这一价格为开滦煤的三倍。但是美国同时又强制日本供应低廉的产品。今年五月十六日，李奇微总部经济科学局长马贵特，发表了所谓“美日经济合作”的声明，他一开头就说：日本将获得美国的订货，但价格需在国际竞争的基础之上。这就是说，日本工业品的价格不得超过国际市场价格。然事实又怎样呢？今年六月日本每吨钢条的成本已达四万五千日元，同期美国的市价为二万九千四百日元〔注五〕只等于日本钢条成本的三分之二。侵朝战争以来日本工业由于原料难于入手与价格高昂而丧失着竞争能力。所以日本资产阶级经济学家木村孙八郎，在谈到“美日经济合作”的有关价格问题时诉苦说：“接受订单的先决问题就是压低价格，但日本商品的价格所以这样高，实在有着无可奈何的理由。既不是因为工资高，也不是由于资本家贪图暴利……日本的工资已经不可能再压低了……具体说来，第一就是原料贵与运费高，这是日本无力解决的问题。”〔注六〕日本资产阶级政治评论家大道寺秋夫，在“日本内政的矛盾”一文中更说：“军需产业面临着这样的矛盾：本来一旦发生战争就会一切都好起来的，现在却因战争而遭殃了。”〔注七〕
   上述美国侵朝战争一年来日本经济危机的日益加深，是和日本日益被拖入侵略战争，与日本日益成为美国统治下的一部分分不开的。今天的日本，在经济上已经成为替美国从事军需加工生产的集中营。根据过去一年间的情况，不难看出美国单独对日媾和后，将必然带给日本以更严重的灾难。
   美国单独对日媾和的目的，是要实现合法地、比较大规模地武装日本的阴谋，以便利用日本的人力、物力，作为它进攻亚洲人民的工具。这就是要把日本更深地拖入战争的漩涡，更进一步使日本成为美国的附庸，结果就将给日本带来毁灭的命运，而不是繁荣。过去一年间日本所走过的道路，已经雄辩地证实了这点，就是日本统治阶级中的不少人，也已清楚了这点。胜间田清一说：“有百分之二十五的粮食、百分之七十的工业原料与百分之八十的船舶依赖于外国的日本，如一旦参加战争，就这些便足以灭亡日本，是洞若观火的。”“如果日本进入世界对立的漩涡中，便会形成火中取栗之势。这一火中取栗的情况是最使人耽心的，即使可能获得一时的繁荣，但当完全被卷进漩涡以后，必将发生极大的困难。”〔注八〕
   美国帝国主义在日本的这种做法，是和日本全民族的基本利益不相容的。日本地主和大资产阶级长期来所进行的侵略战争，曾给日本人民带来极大的灾难，曾不可避免地形成日本帝国主义在第二次世界反法西斯战争中的最后惨败。由于世界人民反法西斯战争的胜利，使日本人民获得了解放的可能性，使日本民族获得了新生的机会。当时日本人民所迫切要求的，就是彻底肃清农村中的封建残余，改善工人生活，使日本经济转而为国内广大人民服务；同时肃清法西斯残余，建立民主政府，保证使日本民族获得新生的各种政策底执行。但是六年来美国在日本的所作所为，完全和日本全民族的要求背道而驰，把日本重新拖上战争与毁灭的旧路。日本人民为了抗拒美国帝国主义的奴役与榨取，六年来在日本共产党的领导下，曾坚持了不屈不挠的斗争。这一斗争尽管不断遭受美日反动派的横暴镇压，但它的声势却是日益扩大的。现在日本人民为反对饥饿，争取独立、民主与和平的斗争，已深入到各个阶层。我们相信，只要美国帝国主义与日本全民族的基本矛盾一天不能解决，日本一天不能取得独立、民主、和平与繁荣，日本人民就一天不会停止斗争，美日反动派的任何镇压都是要失败的。
