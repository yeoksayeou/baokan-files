    Weixian County, Chahar Province: Certain Leading Comrades in Some Departments Neglect Politics; Some Cadres Develop Corrupt Ideas; The CCP County Committee Has Corrected This

    In Weixian County, Chahar Province, some leading comrades in certain departments have a serious tendency to disregard politics. This situation has led to a paralyzing ideology among cadres who fail to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and has fostered ideas of pursuing personal benefits and even corruption and degeneration. The CCP Weixian County Committee of Chahar Province has now taken steps to correct this.

    Many cadres in the county only manage professional work and disregard politics. These comrades are also indifferent to the vigorous patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea that is sweeping the nation. People from all walks of life in the county have signed patriotic pledges; however, only six units at the county and district levels have signed such pledges. The "Production Small Newspaper" published by the county government only introduces production experiences and model examples, and does not conduct patriotic education among the masses. The tendency of economic departments to disregard politics is particularly serious, regarding the central work as irrelevant to themselves. Some leading cadres in these departments are unwilling to attend meetings or listen to reports, on the grounds that they are afraid of delaying their work. When the county launched an anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea propaganda campaign in April, three cadres from the department store participated in this work; the leading comrades of the department considered this an extra burden, saying, "What if the propaganda work affects our business?" During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the higher authorities arranged for the study of the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries. Some leading cadres in economic departments even suggested, "Studying the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries is not as useful as learning some professional knowledge."

    Because of the disregard for politics, the class consciousness of some cadres has become blurred, and they cannot distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. In the appointment of cadres, these comrades proceed solely from the perspective of culture and technology and lack vigilance against counter-revolutionary elements. When the county government selected model workers in government organs, it even selected the special agent Pan Shaoquan (who had infiltrated the organs and pretended to be active, and has since been arrested and detained) as a model; the county People's Bank selected the landlord Li Chengyuan, who had engaged in counter-attacks, as a model. During the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement, after the counter-revolutionary elements who had infiltrated the organs were arrested, some cadres even felt sorry for them and wanted to send them some food.

    The disregard for politics by some leading cadres has led to a lack of emphasis on the political and ideological education of cadres. As a result, many cadres are preoccupied with personal benefits. For example, some cadres in the county supply and marketing cooperative are constantly inquiring about which departments have higher salaries and want to transfer to those departments. Similar phenomena are not uncommon in other departments. Some cadres have even gradually degenerated politically and committed illegal acts of corruption and dereliction of duty. Some party members have developed a regressive mentality, not participating in organizational activities or studying basic party knowledge for two or three months. They even said, "The Party's work never ends, one thing after another, the revolution never ends!"

    After the higher-level Party committee raised the issue of overcoming the tendency to disregard politics, the CCP Weixian County Committee of Chahar Province conducted a preliminary review of these situations and concluded that it was the result of the County Committee's relaxation of political leadership. The County Committee has now decided on specific measures to strengthen cadres' study of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, improve the Party's organizational life, and fight against all tendencies of disregarding politics and liberalism.

    蔚县某些部门领导同志忽视政治
    部分干部滋长腐化思想
    该县中共县委对此已进行纠正
    察哈尔省蔚县某些部门的领导同志有着严重的不问政治的倾向。这种情况，使干部中产生了敌我不分的麻痹思想，并滋长了闹个人待遇，甚至腐化堕落思想。现在中共察哈尔省蔚县委员会对此已进行纠正。
    该县很多干部只管业务不问政治。这些同志对全国人民轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝爱国运动也漠不关心。该县各阶层人民都订了爱国公约；可是县区级机关订了爱国公约的只有六个单位。该县人民政府出版的“生产小报”，单纯介绍生产经验及模范事例，也不向群众进行爱国主义教育。经济部门不问政治的倾向尤为严重，把中心工作看成和自己无关。这些部门有的领导干部不愿参加会议，不愿听报告，理由是怕耽误了业务。在四月份全县展开抗美援朝宣传时，百货公司有三个干部参加这个工作；该部门领导同志就认为这是额外负担，并说：“作宣传工作影响了业务怎么办？”在镇压反革命运动中，上级布置学习惩治反革命条例。有些经济部门的领导干部还提出：“学习惩治反革命条例，不如学习些业务知识有用。”
    由于不问政治，一部分干部的阶级意识就很模糊，分不清敌我界线。在任用干部上，这些同志单纯从文化技术观点出发，对反革命分子缺乏警惕。该县人民政府评选机关模范工作者时，还把混进机关、伪装积极的特务潘少泉（已捕押）评成模范；该县人民银行把曾进行过反攻的地主李成员评成模范。在镇压反革命运动中，混入机关的反革命分子被捕后，有些干部还怜悯他们，想给他们送些吃的东西去。
    部分领导干部不问政治，就对干部的政治思想教育不加重视。因而，不少干部斤斤计较个人待遇。如县供销社有的干部成天打听那个部门薪金高，想跳部门。其他部门类似现象也不少。有些干部甚至在政治上逐渐堕落，做出了贪污渎职的违法行为。有些党员发展了退坡思想，两三个月不过组织生活，也不学习党的基本常识。他们竟说：“党的工作没个完，一个连一个的，革命没个到头啦！”
    中共察哈尔省蔚县委员会在上级党提出克服不问政治倾向后，针对这些情况，初步进行了检查，认为这是县委放松政治领导的结果。现在县委已决定具体办法，加强干部对马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的学习，健全党的组织生活，向一切不问政治的、自由主义的倾向作斗争。
