The Communist Party's Leadership in Eradicating the Huai River Has Given Us a Happy Today
    — A Record of a Conversation with Huo Qiu Production Model Ding Qilan

　　From the age of seven to eighteen, I followed my mother in cotton ginning and weaving, and life was very hard. After I got married at the age of twenty and came to the Li family, I also lived a hard life. After liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we were emancipated.

　　After the big flood last year, the government called for the construction of dams (referring to Huai River management). When I thought of the suffering I had endured during the floods in the past, I immediately listened to Chairman Mao's call and organized women to go to the embankment. At first, some women had difficulties at home. They said, "If we leave, our families will starve to death." "There is no grain to take to the embankment to eat." At this time, I became anxious. I saw some carrots in my house, and I immediately went to mobilize Han Fengying and Pan Laogui's families to lend the carrots to their families to eat. I also lent forty-one catties to Yang Lanying. They were all willing to go. So I organized thirty people to go to the embankment. We worked on the embankment for a total of fourteen days, and each person earned four catties and twelve taels of rice in addition to their own food and drink. When I returned home, I saw that some people in the village still had no way to make a living, so I went to the village government to discuss it, and the village government lent them some corn. At this time, Liu Yuzhen and I organized women and children to collect firewood, and organized young girls to dig vegetables in the fields. We got through the winter famine in this way.

　　After the New Year, all the male laborers went to the embankment, and those who stayed at home still had nothing to eat. So I discussed with the engineering team headquarters of the dam repair and asked for permission for our women to go to the embankment. The team leader agreed to my request. I immediately organized eighty women to go to the embankment and lent them the carrots from my house to solve the problem of their lack of food. After arriving at the embankment, we asked the team headquarters for a rammer. At first, some people were unwilling, saying that women could only carry soil. I discussed with the team headquarters several times, and they lent it to us. The rammer workers of the engineering team said, "Good heavens! How can these women have such great strength!" Later, the team headquarters lent us another rammer. Every day, as soon as it dawned, we went to the embankment, singing songs, carrying soil, and using the rammer. After thirteen days of work, the project was completed. When the migrant workers at the front knew about these things, they said, "We have to work harder, and we don't have to worry about the rear."

　　Then the county asked me to attend a meeting. The work at home was led by my children. The county's hospitality was so good! I was rated as a special-class model and awarded an old cow. Later, I arrived at Sibai Zhang, and the district chief led the migrant workers to greet me. I challenged the migrant workers, guaranteeing that we would finish planting sorghum in the whole township in one week and ensure that no one would starve to death. The migrant workers guaranteed to complete the Sibai Zhang embankment in two weeks. We both at the front and the rear submitted guarantees. As a result, we finished planting sorghum in the whole township in four days and one morning. If it weren't for the Communist Party's leadership in Huai River management, how could we have today? In the future, I must work harder than I do now to take the lead.

    共产党领导根治淮河使我们有了幸福的今天
    ——记霍邱生产模范丁其兰的谈话
    从七岁到十八岁，俺跟妈妈弹棉花和织布，生活很苦。二十岁过了门，来到李家，也过的是苦日子。解放后，在毛主席领导下，我们才翻身了。
    去年发了大水后，政府叫打坝子（指治淮）。俺想起过去遭水灾受的大罪，立刻听了毛主席的号召，组织妇女上堤。开始有的妇女家里有困难，她们说：“走了，家里人就会饿死。”“上坝子没有粮食带去吃。”这时俺急了。俺家里看见有些红萝卜，俺马上去动员韩凤英和潘老贵家，把红萝卜借给她们家里人吃。俺又借了四十一斤给杨兰英。她们都愿意去了。俺就组织了三十人上堤。俺们在堤上一共做了十四天工，除自己吃喝以外，每个人还赚了四斤十二两米。回到家里，俺看到村里有些人生活还没有办法，就到村政府讨论，由村政府借给一些玉米。这时，俺同刘玉珍又组织妇女小孩子去打柴，组织小姑娘下地挖菜。我们就这样度过了冬荒。
    过罢年，男劳动力都上堤去了，留在家里的人仍没有吃的。俺就和修堤的民工大队部讨论，要求准许俺们妇女上堤。大队长答应了我的要求。俺马上组织了八十个妇女上堤，又将俺家的红萝卜借给他们吃，解决了她们缺吃的困难。上堤后，俺们向大队部要了一盘硪。起先有些人不愿意，说妇女只能抬土。俺和大队部讨论几次，他们才借给了。民工大队的硪工们说：“乖乖！这些妇女怎么有这样大劲！”以后大队部又借给了俺们一盘硪。每天天刚亮，俺们就上堤，大家唱着歌，挑土打硪，这样干了十三天，工程就结束了。这些事情被前方的民工知道了，他们说：“俺们要加油干啦，后方地也不愁了。”
    接着县里叫俺去开会。家里地由俺孩子带头干。县里招待才好呢！把我评成特等模范，奖给老牛。后来我到了四百丈，区长带领民工迎接我。我和民工们挑战，保证一星期把全乡秫秫种完，并保证不饿死一个人。民工保证两星期完成四百丈堤。我们前后方都递了保证书。结果我们四天和一早就把全乡秫秫种完了。要不是共产党领导治淮，我们那能有今天呢？以后我定要比现在更努力带头干。
