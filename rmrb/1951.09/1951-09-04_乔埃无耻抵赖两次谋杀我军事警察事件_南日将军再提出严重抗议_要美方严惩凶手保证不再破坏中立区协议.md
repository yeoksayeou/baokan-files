Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 3rd: General Nan Ri, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation, sent to Joye today a reply to his September 2nd reply regarding the incident of South Korean troops invading the neutral zone and murdering our military police personnel. The full text is as follows:

To Vice Admiral Joye, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Your letter of September 2nd regarding the August 30th incident of your South Korean troops illegally invading the neutral zone and murdering our military police personnel once again confirms that your side has no intention of adopting a serious and responsible attitude to deal with your side's violations of the neutral zone agreement, and is determined to continue reckless provocative actions. On August 30th, your South Korean troops, taking advantage of the fact that our military police strictly abide by the neutral zone agreement and only carry weapons for military police duties, carried offensive weapons into the neutral zone and, with the support and cover of your positions, murdered our military police personnel. However, in your letter, you adopted your side's consistent method of distorting the facts and denying everything, attempting to portray your South Korean troops, who illegally sneaked into the neutral zone to murder our military police personnel and then retreated to your area, as local irregular forces, and to portray this serious incident as a public security issue within the neutral zone. This irresponsible and fact-ignoring absurd argument can only lead to the conclusion that your South Korean troops are deliberately continuing this base and shameless behavior in order to undermine the Kaesong armistice negotiations. On July 14th, in order to eliminate disputes over trivial issues and ensure the smooth progress of the armistice negotiations, our side agreed to your side's proposal to designate the Kaesong area as a neutral zone. However, immediately following the neutral zone agreement, on July 16th, there was an incident of your armed personnel firing into the Panmunjom area within the neutral zone. Since then, incidents of your armed personnel firing into the neutral zone have occurred continuously. After your side refused to deal with this incident with a serious and responsible attitude, your South Korean troops illegally invaded the neutral zone and murdered our military police personnel twice, on August 19th and August 30th. I must point out to you that we will never tolerate your armed personnel using the neutral zone agreement to continue the conspiracy of murder. I once again lodge the most serious protest with you, and firmly demand that you severely punish the murderers and thoroughly guarantee that no further incidents of violation of the agreement will occur on your side.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 3rd: General Nan Ri, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation, sent to Joye today a reply to his August 22nd reply. The full text is as follows:

To Vice Admiral Joye, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Your letter of August 22nd regarding the serious incident of your armed personnel illegally invading the Kaesong neutral zone on August 19th, murdering our military police platoon leader Yao Qingxiang and seriously wounding soldier Wang Renyuan, is completely unsatisfactory. Although you had to admit in your letter the truth of the fact that our military police were ambushed on August 19th, you deliberately distorted the facts and altered the results of the on-site investigation by the liaison officers of both sides, attempting to deny that the armed personnel who murdered our military police were armed forces under the command of the United Nations Command, in order to deny your side's inescapable responsibility for this serious incident. Clearly, during the on-site investigation by the liaison officers of both sides, witnesses from all sides clearly stated that the troops who ambushed our military police were your South Korean troops, some of whom were wearing civilian clothes, but most of whom were wearing military uniforms. However, you claimed without reason that "all evidence indicates that these armed personnel were not part of the regular army, but rather irregular forces or guerrilla forces." Clearly, the witnesses at the time clearly pointed out that your South Korean troops who ambushed our military police had invaded the neutral zone from your positions and harassed the residents of Bai Dongyinli. And they retreated to your positions shortly before the liaison officers of both sides conducted the investigation, but you stubbornly claimed that these armed personnel were spontaneous guerrilla forces within the neutral zone. Clearly, your liaison officer, Colonel Murray, also clearly stated when summarizing the investigation results before the end of the on-site investigation: The young woman whom your liaison officer inquired about in Bai Dongyinli clearly testified that she personally saw South Korean troops wearing military uniforms withdraw eastward from the neutral zone and retreat to your positions after the attack. However, you did not mention the South Korean troops at all in the relevant parts of the so-called investigation report, deliberately shielding the illegal actions of the South Korean troops under the command of the United Nations Command. Clearly, your South Korean troops took advantage of the fact that our military police strictly abided by the neutral zone agreement and were not prepared for any combat, and illegally invaded the neutral zone to murder our military police. You attempted to portray this base behavior as a public security issue within the neutral zone. This trick of distorting facts, altering records, and confusing the public can neither absolve your side of responsibility for this serious incident, nor can it achieve your side's goal of concealing the truth and deceiving the people of the world. I once again lodge a serious protest with you, and demand that you deal with this issue with a serious and responsible attitude, severely punish your South Korean troops who murdered our military police, and thoroughly guarantee that no further incidents of violation of the agreement will occur on your side.

    乔埃无耻抵赖两次谋杀我军事警察事件
    南日将军再提出严重抗议
    要美方严惩凶手保证不再破坏中立区协议
    【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，于本日向乔埃送出对他九月二日关于南朝鲜部队侵入中立区谋害我方军事警察的复文的答复，全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃海军中将：
    你在九月二日关于八月三十日你方南朝鲜部队，非法侵入中立区，谋害我方军事警察人员的来信，再一次证实了你方根本还无意采取认真负责的态度，来处理你方破坏中立区协议的事件，而决意继续进行肆无忌惮的挑衅行为。八月三十日你方的南朝鲜部队，利用我方军事警察严格遵守中立区协议，仅带有为军事警察任务所用的武器的事实，携带攻击性的武器侵入中立区，在你方阵地的支持与掩护之下，谋害我军事警察人员。而你在来信中却采取了你方一贯的歪曲事实、抵赖一切的办法，企图将非法窜入中立区谋害我军事警察人员而事后又撤回你方地区的你方南朝鲜部队，说成是当地的非正规部队，而将这一严重事件，说成是中立区以内的治安问题。这种不负责任不顾事实的荒谬论点，只能使人得到一个结论，即你方南朝鲜部队蓄意继续进行这种卑怯无耻的行为，以破坏开城的停战谈判。七月十四日我方为了扫除在枝节问题上的争论，使停战谈判得以顺利进行，同意你方将开城地区划为中立区的建议。但是紧随着中立区的协议，在七月十六日就发生了你方武装人员向中立区之内板门店地区射击的事件，自此以后你方武装人员向中立区以内射击的事件，连续发生。而在你方拒绝以认真负责的态度来处理这件事件后，你方南朝鲜部队更在八月十九日与八月三十日两次非法侵入中立区谋害我军事警察人员。我必须向你指出，我们将决不能容忍你方武装人员利用中立区的协议，继续进行谋杀事件的阴谋。我再一次向你提出最严重的抗议，并坚决要求你严格惩办凶手，并澈底保证你方不再发生破坏协议的任何事件。

    【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，于本日向乔埃送出对他八月二十二日的复文的答复，全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃海军中将：
    你在八月二十二日关于八月十九日你方武装人员非法侵入开城中立区，谋杀我方军事警察排长姚庆祥、重伤战士王仁元的严重事件的来信，是完全不能令人满意的。你在来信中虽然也不得不承认我方军事警察在八月十九日遭遇伏击事实的真实性，但是你却有意歪曲事实，窜改双方联络官当日实地调查的结果，企图否认谋害我方军事警察的武装人员是联合国军统率下的武装部队，以抵赖你方对于这一严重事件的无可逃避的责任。明明在双方联络官实地调查时，各方面的人证都明白声称：伏击我方军事警察的是你方南朝鲜的部队，其中一部分身穿便衣，但大部分穿有军服。而你却毫无理由声称：“所有证据指出这些武装人员不是正规军的一部分，而是非正规军或游击部队”。明明当时的人证都明白指出，伏击我方军事警察的你方南朝鲜部队，是自你方阵地侵入中立区，骚扰白冬音里一带的居民。并在双方联络官进行调查前不久，向你方阵地撤去的，而你却强词夺理地声称这些武装人员是中立区以内自发性的游击部队。明明你方联络官穆莱上校在实地调查结束之前总结调查结果时，也曾明白声明：在白冬音里你方联络官所询问的年青妇女，曾明确作证说：她亲眼看见身穿军衣的南朝鲜部队，在袭击以后向东撤出中立区，退向你方阵地。而你却在所谓调查报告的有关部分之中，根本不提南朝鲜的部队，有意包庇联合国军统率之下南朝鲜部队的不法行为。明明是你方南朝鲜部队乘我方军事警察严格遵守中立区协议未作任何作战准备之便，非法侵入中立区谋害我方军事警察。你却企图将这种卑怯的行为，说成是中立区以内的治安问题，这种歪曲事实，窜改记录混淆视听的伎俩，不但不能为你方解脱对于这一严重事件的责任，也不能达到你方蒙蔽事实真相，欺骗世界人民的目的。我再一次向你提出严重的抗议，并要求你以认真负责的态度，处理这一问题，严格惩办你方谋害我方军事警察的南朝鲜部队，并澈底保证你方不再发生任何破坏协议的事件。
