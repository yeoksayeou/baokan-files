    By implementing a production policy oriented towards rural areas, Shanxi Province's local industry has effectively solved the problems of raw materials and markets, and has thus achieved great development. In addition to the existing factories, nearly twenty new factories are being built or are in preparation throughout the province, including pesticide factories, cotton ginning factories, egg processing factories, and sulfur refining factories. According to incomplete statistics, from the time of liberation to May of this year, the factories have produced more than 14,000 waterwheels and a large number of new-style farm tools such as walking plows, corn threshers, fodder cutters, sprayers, and weeding machines. The pesticide factory successfully trial-produced five kinds of insecticides and fungicides, including copper sulfate, last year. From January to May of this year, the pesticide factory produced 4,600 kilograms of copper sulfate and 5,700 kilograms of copper sulfate. The six egg processing factories affiliated with Shanxi Province Egg Industry Co., Ltd. processed a total of 680,000 fresh eggs last year, which partially solved the difficulty of farmers being unable to sell their eggs, thus stimulating farmers' interest in raising chickens.
    Because the production is suitable for the needs of farmers, the raw materials are abundant, and the sales are good, all factories have made profits and accumulated capital for expanded reproduction. The Wujian Iron Factory in Changzhi, which grew up during the War of Resistance Against Japan as a small munitions factory specializing in supplying weapons and ammunition to the militia, used to lose money. Later, it changed its production policy to manufacture production tools needed in rural areas, such as waterwheels and automobile bearing cups, and its business gradually improved. Last year, this small factory with only more than eighty employees accumulated capital equivalent to 80,000 jin of rice.
    The main difficulty encountered by Shanxi Province's local industry in implementing the policy of orienting towards rural areas is how to make products suitable for the needs of farmers and eliminate the doubts of farmers who have long used backward production tools about new-style production tools. The way factories solve this difficulty is to first investigate the common needs of farmers, then carry out production, then listen to farmers' opinions from experiments, continuously improve, and then promote them. For example, plant diseases and insect pests are a major problem in agricultural production throughout the province. After investigation, the pesticide factory learned that the most serious are black ear disease and baldness disease. Therefore, the factory trial-produced five kinds of agents to combat these two diseases. Later, the factory proved in continuous experiments that copper sulfate and copper sulfate were effective in killing bacteria and harmless to grain crops, so it was decided to mass-produce these two agents.
    In order to eliminate farmers' doubts and promote the use of new agricultural production materials, the factories have used various methods to educate farmers about the comparison between new and old. At the Shanxi Provincial Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition last year, workers gave detailed explanations to farmers from all over the province about the scientific knowledge and use methods of various new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery, which played a major role in this year's promotion. The Cotton Processing Company also organized cotton farmers to visit the cotton ginning factory. The cotton farmers have since realized that machine ginning is better than manual ginning, so they are willing to send the cotton to the factory for processing.
    At present, the products of Shanxi Province's local industry cannot meet the ever-increasing needs of farmers. For example, the products of the pesticide factory can only supply a small part of the province's needs. This situation provides extremely favorable conditions for the future development of local industry.

### 执行面向农村的方针  山西地方工业大有发展

    执行面向农村的方针
    山西地方工业大有发展
    山西省地方工业由于执行了面向农村的生产方针，因而有效地解决了工业生产的原料问题和市场问题，得到很大发展。目前除了原有的工厂，全省新建和正在筹建的工厂有农药厂、轧花厂、打蛋厂、炼磺厂等近二十个。据不完全统计，各厂从解放后到今年五月，已生产了一万四千多部水车和大量步犁、玉米脱粒机、铡草机、喷雾器、锄地机等新式农具。农药厂在去年试制成功了王铜等五种杀虫杀菌药剂。今年一月至五月，农药厂已生产了王铜四千六百公斤，硫酸铜五千七百公斤。山西省蛋业股份有限公司所属六个打蛋厂，去年加工鲜蛋共六十八万个，这就使农民鸡蛋无法销售的困难得到部分解决，因而刺激了农民养鸡的兴趣。
    由于生产适合农民需要，原料多，销路好，各工厂都获得了利润，积累了扩大再生产的资金。长治武建铁工厂是在抗日战争中成长起来专供民兵武器弹药的小军火厂，过去一向赔钱，以后改变生产方针制造农村需要的水车、马车珠碗等生产工具，业务即日益好转。去年这个只有八十多个职工的小工厂，就积累了等于八万斤米的资金。
    山西省地方工业在执行面向农村的方针中遭遇的主要困难是如何使产品适应农民需要，并消除长期使用落后生产工具的农民对于新式的生产工具所存的疑虑。各厂解决这一困难的办法是，先调查农民的普遍需要，进行生产，再从实验中倾听农民意见，不断改进，然后加以推广。如全省农业生产中的病虫害是一个很大的问题。农药厂经过调查后，了解到最严重的是黑穗病和白发病。于是该厂就针对这两种病害试制了五种药剂。以后，该厂又在不断试验中证明王铜、硫酸铜杀菌有效而对谷类庄稼无害，于是才决定大量生产这两种药剂。
    为了消除农民疑虑、推广使用新的农业生产资料，各厂曾运用多种方式向农民进行新与旧的对比教育。在去年山西省工农业展览会上，工人们对各地来参观的农民，详细地讲解了关于各种新式农具和药械的科学知识和使用方法，对今年的推广起着很大作用。棉花加工公司也组织棉农到轧花厂参观。棉农从此切实了解了机器轧花比手工轧花好，因而愿意把棉花送到厂里加工。
    目前山西省地方工业的生产品，已不能满足农民日益增涨的需要。如农药厂的产品，只能供本省需要的一小部分。这种情况给地方工业今后的大发展提供了极有利的条件。（新华社）
