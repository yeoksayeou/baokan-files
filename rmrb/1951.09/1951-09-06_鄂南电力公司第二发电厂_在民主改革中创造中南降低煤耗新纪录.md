    The Second Power Plant of the Enan Electricity Company
    Creates a New Record for Reduced Coal Consumption in Central and South China During the Democratic Reform
    Workers at the Second Power Plant of the Enan Electricity Company in Hubei Province raised their class consciousness during the democratic reform movement and actively engaged in production, setting a new record for reduced coal consumption in July of this year, while also ensuring safe power transmission. At the beginning of the democratic reform movement, a few cadres at the plant did not understand the significance of the democratic reform and feared that it would delay production. Some thought, "We are busy with production now, why engage in democratic reform?" Others said, "Who says democratic reform doesn't hinder production? Meetings always take up time!" When the plant had just mobilized the masses to preliminarily expose a few counter-revolutionaries, some people hoped to end the democratic reform movement quickly, saying, "That's about enough, let's get back to production!" In response to these ideological concerns, the plant's leading cadres repeatedly explained that production could not be improved without thoroughly implementing democratic reform. They also requested cadres to deeply mobilize the masses, individually visit suffering workers, and conduct policy education for the workers. As a result of the above work, workers who previously had ideological concerns boldly stood up to expose and accuse the feudal reactionary elements. The workers said, "The government is truly supporting us; we must thoroughly liberate ourselves." Therefore, the workers continued to demand the denunciation of the crimes of feudal reactionary elements Liang Tianyou, Li Heqing, and Wang Bin.
    In the democratic struggle against feudal remnants, the workers raised their class consciousness, and therefore became more actively concerned about production. Most workers organized themselves to examine the causes of past accidents at the plant. Boiler room workers used to doze off during the second half of the night shift, but they no longer do so. They constantly pay attention to adjusting the wind force and coal layer, keeping the water level and air pressure at the specified levels. They also proactively contact the electrical workshop. When the electrical workshop experiences an increase or decrease in load, they immediately notify the boiler room, so the boiler room can adjust accordingly, unlike in the past when they would add coal haphazardly. As a result, the plant's coal consumption in July was only 0.67 kilograms, a decrease of 7.3 percent compared to 0.717 kilograms in June, setting a new record for the plant and all power plants in the Central and South China region in reducing coal consumption. When the workers encountered difficulties in their work, they actively tried to find solutions to overcome them. For example, the vertical circulating water pump at the plant vibrated during operation, affecting heat generation. Worker Han Xingru came up with the idea of adding a six-inch-long copper ring outside the shaft under the motor, avoiding the vibration phenomenon and ensuring the safe operation of the circulating water pump. Workers Han Xingru and Pan Huangen proposed five rationalization suggestions in July. These vivid facts further shattered the concerns of some cadres that democratic reform would affect production and encouraged the workers' patriotic enthusiasm. When the plant distributed coal-saving bonuses to the workers, worker Su Chengyi took the lead in donating 2.2 million yuan of his bonus to purchase aircraft. Engineer Tang Lanjiu also donated all of his 2.7 million yuan bonus. Most of the workers who received bonuses donated 50 percent of their bonuses. They said, "We must improve production, strengthen the fight against American aggression and aid Korea, and defend our motherland!"

    鄂南电力公司第二发电厂
    在民主改革中创造中南降低煤耗新纪录
    湖北省鄂南电力公司第二发电厂工人在民主改革运动中，提高了阶级觉悟，积极地生产，在今年七月份创造了降低煤耗的新纪录，并且做到了安全送电。该厂在民主改革运动开始时，曾有少数干部不了解民主改革的意义，害怕民主改革会耽误生产。有的认为：“现在生产忙，搞民主改革做什么？”有的说：“谁说民主改革不妨碍生产？开会总要耽误时间呵！”当该厂刚刚发动群众初步地检举了几个反革命分子的时候，有些人就希望赶快结束民主改革运动，他们说：“差不多了，早点转入生产吧！”该厂领导干部针对上述思想情况，一再说明：不澈底实行民主改革，就不可能搞好生产；并且要求干部深入地发动群众，个别地访问受苦的工人，并向工人进行政策教育。由于进行了以上的工作，就使得过去在思想上有顾虑的工人大胆地起来检举和控诉封建反动分子。工人说：“政府真给我们撑腰了，我们要澈底翻身。”于是工人们便继续要求控诉封建反动分子梁天佑、李和清和王彬的罪行。
    工人们在反封建残余的民主斗争中，提高了阶级觉悟，因此更积极地关心生产。大多数工人都自动地组织起来，检查该厂过去发生事故的原因。锅炉房工人过去在下半夜值班时，常打瞌睡，现在再也不这样了。他们时时刻刻地注意调节风力和煤层，使水位和气压保持定额。他们还主动地和电气车间联系。当电气车间遇有负荷增减时，立即通知锅炉房，锅炉房就能随时掌握变化，不会像过去那样乱添煤了。因此该厂七月份煤耗仅为零点六七公斤，比六月份零点七一七公斤，降低了百分之七点三，创造了该厂和全中南区电厂降低煤耗的最新纪录。该厂工人们在工作中遇到困难，即主动地想办法克服。如该厂直立式循环水泵地轴在运转时，发生震动，影响发热。工人韩兴如就想法在马达下的地轴外面加装一个六吋长的铜圈，避免了震动现象，保证了循环水泵安全地运转。工人韩兴如和潘焕根在七月份提出了五件合理化建议。这些生动的事实，进一步粉碎了某些干部怕民主改革影响生产的顾虑。并鼓舞了工人的爱国热情。当该厂把省煤奖金发给工人时，工友苏成一首先把二十二万元奖金捐献出来，购买飞机。工程师汤兰九也把二十七万元奖金全部捐出。大部分得奖金的工人都捐出了百分之五十的奖金。他们说：“我们必须搞好生产，加强抗美援朝力量，保卫祖国！”
