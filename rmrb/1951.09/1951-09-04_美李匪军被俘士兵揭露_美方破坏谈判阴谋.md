Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd: From the confessions of enemy personnel recently captured, it can be seen that the US aggressors and their running dog, the Li Seung-man gang, have absolutely no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

According to Privates Owen and Monroe of the 7th Company, 24th Regiment, 25th Division of the US invading army, who were captured by our army on July 17, the heads of the US invading army did not allow the soldiers to fully know the news of the Kaesong negotiations. Until the day they were captured, the two of them only knew that Malik had put forward a peace proposal. As for when the negotiations started and what they were about, they were completely ignorant. They didn't even know that negotiations were being held in Kaesong. The confession of Lieutenant Haley, a pilot of the 2nd Squadron (South African Air Force Squadron) of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing of the US Air Force, who was captured during the bombing of the Korean rear during the negotiation period, further illustrates what kind of peace the US aggressors have in mind. He confessed that while drinking at the airport club, the deputy squadron leader of the 39th Squadron in the same wing told everyone: "The so-called negotiation is to get the Chinese to get out, and the 'United Nations Army' will stay here to carry out new missions." But the US soldiers and some junior officers are unwilling to carry out any "new missions." In early July, when the company commander of the 7th Company, 24th Regiment, 25th Division of the US invading army learned that the armistice negotiations were about to begin, he convened a meeting of the entire company and said: "Negotiations are about to begin, but our high officials and Li Seung-man still want to continue fighting. What do you think?" The soldiers shouted: "Let them fight, we want to go home." The company commander also said: "I want to go home too."

According to captured soldiers of the Li pseudo-army, on July 22, Li, the commander of the pseudo-1st Division, told his soldiers: "The peace talks will not succeed, you must prepare to fight. We must fight all the way to Mount Baitou (Note: north of the Yalu River in our country) before Korea can have 'peace'." But his soldiers were not completely ignorant. They saw the leaflets distributed by our side regarding the ceasefire, so they knew our just proposals and peaceful sincerity. The soldiers privately discussed their division commander's remarks. A Sergeant Jin of the 3rd Supply Battalion of the 15th Regiment said: "Why don't our high officials publicize the truth about the negotiations if they say others have no peaceful sincerity?" Another Sergeant Jin of the weapons department of the same team said angrily: "What reason does the US military have to be stationed in Korea?!" A Sergeant Xu said: "I have personally seen US troops rape our Korean sisters, and US planes bomb Korean towns. Why should I help the Americans fight my own people?" There were also many people who swallowed their anger, because they were afraid of being "heard by the officials and military police who would kill them." But according to the prisoners, these people all knew who wanted peace and who didn't. In order not to die for the Americans, they fled one after another. The day after the commander of the pseudo-1st Division spoke, three soldiers fled from the 3rd Battalion of the 15th Regiment, one of whom fled to our army's position.

    美李匪军被俘士兵揭露
    美方破坏谈判阴谋
   【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】从最近被俘的敌军人员的供辞中，可以看出美国侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮，对和平解决朝鲜问题是完全没有诚意的。
    据在七月十七日被我军俘虏的美侵略军第二十五师二十四团七连的上等兵欧文和门罗供称：美国侵略军的头目们不让士兵们充分知道开城谈判的消息。直到他们被俘的那一天，他们两人只知道马立克提出了和平建议。至于那一天开始谈判，谈些什么，他们都茫然无知。甚至连在开城举行谈判都不知道。在谈判期中轰炸朝鲜后方地区时被俘的美空军第十八战斗轰炸联队二中队（南菲空军中队）少尉驾驶员哈莱的供辞，更说明了美国侵略者心目中的和平是怎样一回事。他供认：在机场俱乐部喝酒时，与他同一联队三十九中队的少校副中队长对大家说：“所谓谈判就是要中国人滚出去，‘联合国军’还要留在这里执行新任务。”但是美军的士兵和一些下级军官是不愿意再执行什么“新任务”的。七月初，当美国侵略军第二十五师二十四团七连连长知道了停战谈判将开始的消息时，他召集了全连士兵开会说：“要谈判了，可是我们的大官们和李承晚还是想继续打。你们意见怎样？”士兵们大声叫道：“让他们去打，我们要回家。”连长也说：“我也要回家。”
    据被俘的李伪军士兵供称：七月二十二日伪一师师长李某对他的士兵们说：“和谈是不会成功的，你们要准备打。我们要一直打到白头山（按：在鸭绿江以北我国境内），朝鲜才能有‘和平’。”可是他的士兵们并不是完全愚昧无知的。他们看到了我方散发的关于停战的宣传品，因此他们知道我方的公正建议和和平诚意。士兵们私下里纷纷议论着他们师长的谈话。十五联队补给第三大队的一个姓金的二等中士说：“说别人没有和平诚意，为什么我们的大官不公布谈判真相呢？”同队兵器部另一个姓金的一等中士愤慨地说：“美国军队凭什么理由要驻在朝鲜？！”一个姓徐的中士说：“我亲眼看见美军强奸我们朝鲜姐妹，美国飞机炸毁朝鲜城镇。我为什么要帮助美国人来打自己人呢？”还有不少人忍气吞声，因为他们害怕被“官儿们和宪兵们听见了要了命”。但是据俘虏供称：这些人心中都明白谁要和平谁不要和平。他们为了不愿意替美国人送死，纷纷逃亡。伪一师师长讲过话的第二天，十五联队第三大队就跑了三个，其中有一个逃到我军阵地中来了。
