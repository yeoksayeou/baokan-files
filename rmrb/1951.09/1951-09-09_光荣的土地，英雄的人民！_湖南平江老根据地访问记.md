Glorious Land, Heroic People!
——A Visit to the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Pingjiang, Hunan
Xinhua News Agency Reporter: Wen Qing, Hu Jian

The base area centered on Pingjiang was one of the old revolutionary base areas during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the strange and towering hilltops here served as excellent positions for the old Red Army and guerrillas to fight against the enemy. Dense forests, reeds, and caves provided campsites, classrooms, and meeting places for the soldiers. During the most difficult times, wild grass, leaves, and bamboo shoots sustained countless revolutionary heroes from starvation. As we walked into these towering mountains, we deeply felt that every blade of grass and every tree in the old base area was dear and lovable.

In Heping Township, a revolutionary story of "Eighteen Good Men" is circulating. This story tells us how the people of the old base area, united around the Communist Party, stubbornly persisted in the long-term revolutionary struggle against the Kuomintang bandit army.

Lishuidong in Heping Township is a mountain valley more than forty miles long. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Xiang-E-Gan Provincial Workers', Peasants', and Democratic Government persisted in fighting here for a long time. In the course of many years of cruel revolutionary struggle, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang adopted the "Three Alls Policy" of burning all, killing all, and looting all, often setting the mountains ablaze with towering flames. Everyone said: "Even a man of steel would find it difficult to cross this Flaming Mountain." Many people believed that the mountain valley had long been depopulated. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the heroic people wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the corpses of their loved ones, moved into caves, gnawed on vegetable roots, and stubbornly continued to fight against the Kuomintang bandit gang. Of the more than sixteen hundred people in the entire valley, only eighteen remained in the end, still fighting on the top of the high mountains. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, they came out of the caves, and everyone hailed them as "immortals." The heroes explained to everyone, saying: "We are not immortals, we are Chairman Mao's steel warriors."

Among the "Eighteen Good Men," Yang Longxing's family had four members. Yang Longxing is sixty-four years old this year and is an ordinary poor peasant. In the difficult years, he cherished the Red Army more than his own life. He said: "The Red Army is our lifeline."

In 1932, a part of the Red Sixteenth Army transferred to Lishuidong. He raised more than three hundred piculs of grain and, together with his children, carried it load by load to hide in the deep mountain caves. Despite the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's round-the-clock search, he tried every means to preserve it, and every grain was used to supply the Red Army. His boundless loyalty to the cause of the people's revolution made him a thorn in the side of the counter-revolutionaries. The following year, on a snowy day, the bandit troops of Zhou Yao dragged his seventy-year-old mother out of the mountains, asking him to claim her. He said directly: "I would rather die on the land of the Communist Party." His mother was sacrificed. Swallowing his tears, he sent his only son into the Red Army. He told his child:
“Remember! Who killed your grandmother.” He mobilized and organized the people in the entire cave to participate in the work of rescuing Red Army wounded and sick soldiers and maintaining communications. During the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's offensives, they carried the wounded and sick soldiers to transfer and hide all day long. On the snow, with every step they took, they had to turn around and cover their footprints with their hands to prevent the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army from tracking them down. They often saved food and salt from their own mouths to give to the Red Army wounded and sick soldiers. Everyone said: "We would rather go hungry than let the Red Army soldiers go hungry. They are our hope, the saviors of the people of the whole country."

After the main force of the Red Army moved north, the people of the old base area missed Chairman Mao day and night, hoping for the return of the old Red Army. Many people treasured Chairman Mao's portraits and revolutionary documents, waiting for the day of liberation. In 1929, Deng Haicheng, the secretary of the Communist Youth League District Committee, carved the will of the people of that time on a bamboo in Baishikeng, Huanxin Township: "Implement the dictatorship of workers and peasants and complete the land revolution." In 1931, Comrade Deng Haicheng gloriously sacrificed himself in the counter-"encirclement and suppression." People covered the words on this bamboo with dry grass, firmly believing that their hope would be realized. After liberation, people removed the grass, and the bamboo had grown as thick as a bowl, but the writing was still clearly visible. The will of the people for decades has now been realized. When the visiting group came to this mountain valley, the sound of people shouting "Long live Chairman Mao" shook the mountains. They cut down the bamboo that they had guarded for more than twenty years and entrusted the visiting group to take it to Beijing and give it to Chairman Mao. They repeatedly urged the visiting group to tell Chairman Mao: "Our hearts are forever with Chairman Mao, and we will forever follow Chairman Mao to advance victoriously."

The people of the old base area, who have been tempered and refined, are now rebuilding the homeland destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit gang with unparalleled enthusiasm and diligent hands. The glorious red flags of "Model Village" and "Model Township" are planted where the red flags of the old Red Army once fluttered. Guofu Township, which implemented land reform in 1930, has now won three red flags: "Autumn Grain Collection Model," "Production Model," and "Resist America, Aid Korea Model." After liberation, the chairman of the village workers', peasants', and democratic government and the chairman of the peasant association during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War returned to the township to lead the peasants' struggle and construction. They led the people to use the more than 7,000 jin of rice and other production loan grain successively issued by the people's government to production and construction, so that 80 percent of the barren land grew crops, and 50 percent of the houses burned down by the counter-revolutionaries were rebuilt. Now, every household has begun to add new farm tools and new clothes, and everywhere presents a new atmosphere. More than 500 young peasants in Guofu Township have joined reading groups, and there are 21 rural propagandists who regularly conduct patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea for the peasants. The entire township has established production increase and donation plans, and more than 2,500 people in the township have pledged to donate more than 58,400 jin of rice, and women have also donated more than 1.5 million yuan separately. At present, the peasants of the entire township, in order to thank Chairman Mao for his concern for them, have revised the township's patriotic covenant, guaranteeing to take the lead in all work, do a good job in preferential treatment, and overfulfill the production increase and donation plan.

The people of the old revolutionary base area of Pingjiang have paid a noble price for the liberation cause of the Chinese people, and therefore have a deeper understanding of the preciousness of today's victory. In order to defend this glorious victory, the people of the old base area assured the visiting group: We have won the victory with blood and sweat, and we must defend the victory with blood and sweat. We guarantee to implement Chairman Mao's instructions: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory."

    光荣的土地，英雄的人民！
    ——湖南平江老根据地访问记
    新华社记者  文清、胡坚
    以平江为中心的根据地，是第二次国内革命战争时期的老根据地之一。在第二次国内革命战争期中，这里的一个紧接着一个的奇怪而高矗的山头，是老红军与游击队与敌人作战的好阵地。密集的树林、芦草和岩洞，给战士们安排了宿营地、课堂和会场。野草、树叶和竹笋，在最艰苦的时候曾经支持了无数革命志士免于饿死。我们走进这崇山峻岭之中，深深地感到老根据地一草一木都亲切可爱。
    在和平乡流传着一个“十八条好汉”的革命故事。这故事告诉了我们，团结在共产党周围的老根据地人民，是如何顽强地坚持了对国民党匪军的长期的革命斗争。
    和平乡丽水洞是一条四十多里长的山沟，第二次国内革命战争时期，湘鄂赣省工农民主政府曾长期在这里坚持斗争。在多年残酷的革命斗争中，蒋匪帮采取烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光政策”，经常把山烧得烈焰冲天。谁都说：“钢铁人也难过这火焰山。”许多人都认定山沟里早已绝了人烟。可是，在共产党的领导下，英雄的人们揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好亲人的尸体，搬进岩洞，啃着菜根，顽强地和国民党匪帮继续进行斗争。全洞一千六百多人，到后来只剩下十八个人，仍然战斗在高山之巅。一九三七年抗日战争开始后，他们出了洞，大家把他们传为“神仙”。英雄们向大家作了解释，他们说：“我们不是神仙，我们是毛主席的钢铁战士。”
        “十八条好汉”中，杨龙兴老汉家就有四个人。杨龙兴今年六十四岁，是一个普通的贫苦农民。在艰苦的岁月里，他爱护红军，胜过爱护自己的生命。他说：“红军是我们的命根子。”
        一九三二年红十六军一部转移到丽水洞。他筹集了三百多石谷子，带着自己的孩子一挑挑地藏在深山岩洞里。尽管蒋匪军日夜搜索，他千方百计地设法保管，一粒粒都作了红军的给养。对人民革命事业的无限忠诚，使他成了反革命的眼中钉。第二年
    一个大雪天，周尧匪部把他七十多岁的老娘拖出山去，要他来领取。他直接了当地说：“我死活都要在共产党的土地上。”老娘牺牲了。他吞着泪水，把自己的独子送进了红军。他叮嘱自己的孩子说：
    “记住！是谁杀了你的祖母。”他动员和组织全洞人参加救护红军伤病员和通讯联络的工作。在蒋匪军进攻中，他们成天背着伤病员转移、隐蔽。在雪地上，他们每走一步，都要回头用手掩好脚印，以免蒋匪军跟踪追来。他们经常从自己嘴边省下口粮、食盐，给红军伤病员吃。大家都说：“宁可我们挨饿，也不能让红军战士挨饿。他们是我们的希望，是全国人民的救星。”
    红军主力北上后，老根据地人民朝夕怀念毛主席，怀念老红军回来。许多人把毛主席的像片和革命文献珍藏起来，等待着解放的日子。一九二九年，少共区委书记邓海澄在焕新乡白石坑地方的一根竹子上，刻下了当年人民的意志：“实行工农专政，完成土地革命。”一九三一年，邓海澄同志在反“围剿”中光荣牺牲了。人们用干草把这根竹子的字掩盖起来，坚信自己的希望定会实现。解放了，人们除去苺草，竹子已长得碗口一样粗，字迹仍清晰可辨。数十年来人民的意志，如今实现了。当访问团来到这个山沟时，人们欢呼“毛主席万岁”的声音，震动着山岳。他们把守护了二十多年的竹子砍下来，托访问团带到北京，送给毛主席。他们再三叮嘱访问团转告毛主席：“我们的心，永远向着毛主席，永远跟随着毛主席胜利前进。”
    经过千锤百炼的老根据地人民，目前正以无比的热情，用勤劳的双手，重建被国民党匪帮摧毁的家园。“模范村”、“模范乡”的光荣的红旗，都插在当年老红军的红旗飘扬过的地方。一九三零年曾实行土地改革的国福乡，现在就获得了“秋征模范”、“生产模范”、“抗美援朝模范”三面大红旗。解放后，国福乡第二次国内革命战争时期的村工农民主政府主席和农民协会主席，回到乡里领导农民斗争和建设。他们领导人民将人民政府先后发给的优抚粮七千多斤大米和其他生产贷粮，用到生产建设上去，使荒芜的土地中有百分之八十长出了庄稼，被反革命烧毁的房屋中也有百分之五十重建起来。现在，家家户户都开始添置新农具和新衣服，处处呈现着新气象。国福乡有五百多青年农民参加了读报小组，并有二十一个农村宣传员，经常向农民进行抗美援朝爱国教育。全乡家家订立了增产捐献计划，全乡二千五百多人认捐了五万八千四百多斤稻谷，妇女还单独捐献了一百五十余万元。目前全乡农民为答谢毛主席对他们的关怀，重新修订了全乡的爱国公约，保证在各项工作中起带头作用，做好优抚工作和超额完成增产捐献计划。
    平江老根据地的人民为中国人民的解放事业曾付出过高贵的代价，因而就更深切地认识到今天胜利的宝贵。为了保卫这辉煌的胜利，老根据地的人民向访问团保证：我们既用血汗取得了胜利，就更要用血汗来保卫胜利。我们保证执行毛主席的指示：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣。”
