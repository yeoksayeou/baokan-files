Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 25th: This reporter learned from the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers that at 6:00 PM on September 24th, our liaison officer, under the order of our chief representative, formally proposed to the United Nations Command delegation that the two sides' representatives resume negotiations at 10:00 AM on September 25th. The other side did not agree to this proposal and refused to resume negotiations on the 25th. Our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, met with the other side's liaison officers, Colonel Kinney and Major Mu Lei, again at 10:00 AM on September 25th to continue discussing other dates and times for resuming negotiations in Kaesong. Colonel Zhang Chunshan, under the order of our chief representative, once again suggested that the representatives of both sides resume negotiations at 10:00 AM on September 26th, but Colonel Kinney continued to avoid expressing his opinion on our proposal and instead raised the issue of discussing the so-called conditions for resuming the armistice negotiation meetings. Colonel Zhang Chunshan immediately pointed out that the issue of the so-called conditions for resuming armistice negotiations had already been refuted again by Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai in their letter to Ridgway on September 24th, and that the other side's commander-in-chief should not order his liaison officers to adhere to a position that had already been rejected by our commanders, in order to avoid giving a direct response to our commanders. Colonel Zhang Chunshan finally stated that since the other side was still unable to express its opinion on our proposal that the representatives of both sides formally resume the Kaesong armistice negotiations at 10:00 AM on September 26th, there was no need to continue the discussion, so he suggested adjourning the meeting to await the other side's response to our proposal. Colonel Kinney agreed to adjourn the meeting to await instructions from his superiors. The meeting between the liaison officers of both sides ended at 10:48 AM.

Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: French "Ce Soir" reporter Philippe Baechtold reported from Kaesong on the 25th: Ridgway's liaison officer, Colonel Kinney, destroyed the efforts to put the Kaesong armistice negotiations on a normal track this morning. In this morning's meeting, Kinney still insisted that negotiations be conducted by liaison officers. The Korean chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang, informed Kinney to convey to his chief representative General Nam Il's suggestion to resume the representative meeting at ten o'clock tomorrow morning. Kinney rejected this on behalf of Ridgway. He still insisted on changing the meeting location and insisted on lengthy arguments over the issue of conditions. The content of the letter from the Korean-Chinese side last night requesting a meeting of representatives from both sides today was not announced to the American reporters covering the meeting, which made them very unhappy.

     美方竟拒绝立即恢复谈判
     我联络官奉命再次建议二十六日复会
     美方继续提出所谓复会条件横加阻挠
    【新华社开城二十五日电】本社记者由朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团获悉：九月二十四日下午六时我方联络官奉我方首席代表之命，向联合国军代表团正式提出双方代表在九月二十五日上午十时恢复谈判的建议。对方对于这一建议不表同意，拒绝二十五日恢复谈判。我方联络官张春山上校、柴成文中校在九月二十五日上午十时再度与对方联络官肯尼上校、穆莱上校会晤，继续讨论在开城恢复谈判的其他日期与时间。张春山上校奉我方首席代表之命再一次建议双方代表在九月二十六日上午十时恢复谈判，但肯尼上校继续避免对于我方建议表示意见，而再度提出讨论所谓恢复停战谈判会议的条件。张春山上校当即指出所谓恢复停战谈判的条件的问题，早已有金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员在九月二十四日致李奇微信中再次驳斥，对方总司令不应该命令其联络官固守已被我方司令官所否定的立场，以避免对我方司令官作正面答复。张春山上校最后声明既然对方尚不能对我方所提出的双方代表在九月二十六日上午十时正式恢复开城停战谈判的建议表示意见，继续商谈已无必要，因此建议散会，以待对方对于我方提议的答复。肯尼上校同意散会，以等待上级的训令。双方联络官的会谈在十时四十八分结束。
    【新华社二十五日讯】法国今晚报记者贝却敌二十五日自开城报道：李奇微的联络官肯尼上校今晨破坏了使开城停战谈判走上常轨的努力。在今晨的会谈中，肯尼还是坚持由联络官一级的人员来进行谈判。朝鲜首席联络官张上校通知肯尼，叫他把南日将军主张明晨十时恢复代表会议的建议转告他的首席代表。肯尼代表李奇微加以拒绝。他仍然坚持变更会议地点，并坚持要在条件的问题上长久地争执下去。朝中方面昨夜的信件要求今日举行双方代表的会议，然而这信件的内容美方并没有向采访会议新闻的美国记者宣布，这使他们很不高兴。
