Xinhua News Agency, September 10th: TASS San Francisco reported:

Gromyko, head of the Soviet delegation attending the San Francisco Peace Treaty Conference, held a press conference on September 8th, attended by 300 journalists. Gromyko said:

“The Soviet delegation’s speeches at the conference have assessed the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan, stating that this draft cannot serve as the basis for a genuine peace in the Far East. It cannot be the basis for a peace that does not allow the resurgence of Japanese militarism, guarantees the peace and security of Asian and Far Eastern countries, meets the legitimate demands of the people who have suffered from Japanese aggression, and at the same time guarantees the restoration of Japan’s sovereignty and independence.

The US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan lacks guarantees to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, and providing such guarantees should be one of the basic tasks of the peace treaty with Japan. However, all countries that participated in the war against Japan recognize that it is necessary to provide guarantees to prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor nation again, and believe that this guarantee is one of the basic principles of the Far Eastern peace treaty. This is precisely the main task stipulated in the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, and the decisions passed by the Far Eastern Commission based on this proclamation.

Contrary to the above-mentioned basic principles of the Far Eastern peace treaty, the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan differs from all peace treaties signed in Europe in 1947—especially the peace treaty with Italy—in that it does not restrict Japan's armed forces, nor does it generally prevent the revival of Japanese militarism.

However, experience has shown that once Japanese militarists begin to plot aggression against any of their neighbors, they immediately and rapidly increase their armed forces.

This can be proven by the following examples:

After Japan attacked Russia in 1904, it quickly increased its army to 2.75 million people.

In 1920, in order to intervene in the Soviet Union's Far East and seize Soviet Far Eastern territory, Japan dispatched eleven infantry divisions, about 175,000 people, from its then twenty-one divisions, and dispatched a large number of warships and marines.

When the Japanese army began to invade Manchuria in 1931, Japan had 200,000 ground troops and quickly established a huge navy, including ten battleships, four aircraft carriers, thirty-eight cruisers, one hundred and two destroyers, fifty-eight submarines, and more than one hundred other warships.

Before attacking China in 1937, Japan rapidly expanded its army to nearly 400,000 people. At this time, the composition of the Japanese navy had been reorganized, with warships increasing to more than 300, with a total displacement of 1.13 million tons.

In preparation for a large-scale war of aggression in the Pacific to seize foreign territories and enslave many Asian countries, Japan expanded its army to 3.2 million people and reorganized its navy in early December 1941. The navy had 403 battleships and auxiliary ships, with a total displacement of 1.4 million tons, and more than 600,000 personnel.

By the end of the war (August 1945), the Japanese army had nearly 6 million people, and the navy had more than 500 ships and nearly 1.7 million personnel.

The Soviet delegation, as well as the Polish and Czechoslovak delegations, have fully explained the true nature of the US-UK draft treaty. The Soviet delegation has stated in its speech that this is not a draft for peace, but a draft for preparing another war in the Far East. From their draft, it can be clearly seen that the US and British governments have ulterior motives for Japan. They are determined to open a wide path for the revival of Japanese militarism, which poses a threat again to countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression, mainly Japan's neighbors.

The US-UK draft peace treaty not only clears a wide path for the revival of Japanese militarism, but also turns Japan into a US military base, because the draft even stipulates that Japan now has the obligation to offer Japanese territory for US troops to be stationed. In fact, the draft is to allow the US military to continue to occupy Japan. Therefore, Japan is regarded as a US military springboard. Is it possible to talk about Japanese sovereignty under these circumstances? Obviously, in this case, the Japanese sovereignty under the US-UK draft peace treaty will not be much different from the sovereignty of, for example, the Philippines, which is trapped in a US military base network.

Finally, it should also be pointed out that the US-UK draft peace treaty stipulates that Japan be dragged into aggressive military alliances that are being established under US auspices.

Everyone knows clearly which countries these alliances are established to deal with. It is no accident that such a veteran war-monger as Dulles was entrusted with drafting the peace treaty with Japan. Like a diligent traveling salesman, he traveled around the capitals of certain countries in order to sell the peace treaty draft favored by the United States to the governments of those countries, disguised as the real thing.

All of this shows that the drafters of the US-UK draft peace treaty harbor aggressive purposes and that this draft hides the insatiable plans of imperialism. The false and hypocritical statements made at the conference by the initiators of the draft treaty and certain vassal states of the United States cannot cover up this fact. This refers in particular to the representatives of the United States, whose boastful speeches and rude and arrogant behavior at the conference further exposed the US government's policy of being hostile to peace.

Only simple-minded or completely ignorant people would believe the argument that including the above-mentioned clauses in the treaty is entirely for Japan's self-defense.

Everyone knows that Japan is not threatened by any country. It has never been attacked by others for many centuries, but Japanese militarists have repeatedly carried out aggression against their neighbors. The so-called self-defense is actually just to cover up the aforementioned military clauses of the US-UK draft peace treaty, which are aimed at countries bordering Japan, primarily the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. This is also demonstrated by the fact that the military agreements stipulated in the US-UK draft peace treaty exclude countries such as the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union from participating.

The Soviet government has long pointed out that a separate treaty with Japan is not permissible. However, what the San Francisco conference is doing is precisely concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan. Every sensible person must know very clearly that a genuine peace in the Far East is impossible without the participation of the People's Republic of China, one of Japan's closest neighbors. The Chinese people suffered significant losses in the struggle against Japanese aggressors and contributed the most to defeating Japanese militarists. Therefore, it is only natural that the Chinese people demand the establishment of a genuine peace in the Far East. Therefore, the Chinese people have the indisputable right to participate in the preparation and signing of the peace treaty with Japan.

If the US and British governments were truly seeking to establish peace in the Far East, they should have tried to reach an agreement with the People's Republic of China on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. Everyone knows that the drafters of the peace treaty with Japan have not made such efforts. Not only that, but when the Soviet delegation suggested at the meeting that the People's Republic of China be invited to attend the meeting with equal status, this suggestion was rejected under the brutal pressure of the United States. This is the most unfair action against the Chinese people. There is no doubt that the 500 million Chinese people will not forget this serious violation of their indisputable rights. This has created a situation where the Chinese people, who bore the heaviest burden in the struggle against Japanese militarists, are not represented at the conference, while the issue of the peace treaty with Japan is being resolved at a conference where the vast majority of participating countries did not participate in the war against Japan.

The conference organizers made arrangements so that countries such as El Salvador and Nicaragua participated in resolving the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, while China did not participate. Only the blind cannot see this absurd situation. Obviously, it does not matter whether certain countries attending the conference sign the peace treaty with Japan or not. However, it is completely different if the People's Republic of China does not sign the treaty. It should be pointed out that China is not the only Asian country that did not attend the meeting. India, the second largest and most important country in Asia, and Burma also felt unable to participate in the work of the conference because they could not agree with the US-UK draft peace treaty, which fundamentally contradicts the interests of the people of Asian countries.

As for the Soviet Union, the facts are exactly the opposite of the US representative's assertion. The Soviet government was not consulted at all regarding the peace treaty with Japan, and when the Soviet government put forward certain opinions or suggestions regarding the peace treaty with Japan, the US government simply ignored these opinions or suggestions. This means that although the US government claims to want to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, it has been unwilling in the past and is unwilling now to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union.

Everyone understands that a peaceful resolution of the Far East issue is also impossible without the participation of the Soviet Union.

If the US and British governments, which put forward the draft treaty, believe that they can conclude a peace treaty with Japan under these circumstances, it can only be because they insist on the policy of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan without the participation of Japan's main neighbors; because their purpose is not to establish peace in the Far East, but to launch another war, in which they intend to use Japan as a tool for their imperialist aggressive plans.

All of this can only cause legitimate anxiety to those countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression. Undoubtedly, the Japanese people are also very uneasy about the prospect of being used as cannon fodder to realize the United States' Far Eastern aggression plans. The Soviet delegation received an appeal from the Patriotic Movement Council for Comprehensive Peace with Japan (this appeal has also been sent to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and India). This appeal stated that 5 million Japanese people have signed petitions protesting the separate peace treaty that deceives Japan. It also stated that if the Japanese delegation led by Prime Minister Yoshida signs this treaty, the Japanese people will never recognize this treaty.

The Soviet delegation also received some letters from various Japanese trade union organizations protesting against actions that would involve Japan in military adventures and protesting against the separate peace treaty.

In short, the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan is a secret pact between the US government and the current Japanese government, and the current Japanese government is bound hand and foot by the United States, and therefore cannot express the opinions of the Japanese people.

Prime Minister Yoshida's speech at the conference showed that not everyone in Japan has understood the necessity of establishing and maintaining normal peaceful relations, first of all with its neighbors—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The Japanese Prime Minister tried to justify the collusion between the Japanese government and the United States and thereby turn Japan into a US military base, repeating the usual slander that Japan is "threatened from the north," although the absurdity of this slander is very obvious.

The aforementioned letters and appeals confirm the undeniable fact that when the US government implements its military plans in Japan, it relies precisely on the military group that has repeatedly pushed Japan onto the path of aggression, rather than the democratic forces of Japan. This is precisely why the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan does not contain any clauses that can guarantee the basic democratic rights and freedoms of the Japanese people, or any clauses that do not allow the revival of any militarist groups. All the treaties concluded in Europe in 1947 contain such clauses because they were formulated directly based on the Potsdam Proclamation, but the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan does not contain such clauses.

As for the territorial issue, it is even more widely known that the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan seriously violates China's rights to Taiwan (Formosa), the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and other islands, which have always been Chinese territories; they were only separated from China as a result of Japanese aggression.

All of these are in disregard of the fact that the drafters of this draft—the US and British governments—have recognized China's indisputable rights to these territories in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, and have undertaken the obligation to guarantee the exercise of these rights.

By doing this, the drafters of the draft treaty intend to legitimize the US occupation of Taiwan (Formosa) as a result of direct aggression against the People's Republic of China.

At the same time, despite the solemn declaration by the US and British governments in the Cairo Declaration that they would never conquer others for themselves or intend to expand their territory, contrary to the Cairo Declaration, the drafters of the US-UK draft intend to separate several groups of islands (Ryukyu, Ogasawara, and others) from Japan and give them to the United States under the pretext of handing them over to the United Nations for trusteeship, although the United States has no right to these islands.

This demand by the US government stems from expansionist greed.

The Soviet delegation has reminded the conference that it is impermissible that the draft peace treaty with Japan does not mention at all that Japan must recognize Soviet sovereignty over southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. This draft is in complete contradiction with the obligations undertaken by the United States and Britain under the Yalta Agreement regarding these territories.

As everyone knows, the Soviet delegation has put forward several amendments and supplements to the US-UK draft at the conference, which fully demonstrate the Soviet government's attitude towards the issue of the peace treaty with Japan.

These amendments relate to the following most important issues:

(1) Preventing the revival of Japanese militarism.

(2) Withdrawal of foreign occupying forces from Japanese territory and preventing the establishment of foreign military bases on Japanese territory.

(3) Preventing Japan from participating in alliances or military alliances aimed at any country that fought against Japan.

(4) Resolving territorial issues strictly in accordance with existing international agreements on this issue.

(5) Guaranteeing the Japanese people's democratic rights and freedoms.

(6) Unobstructed development of Japanese peaceful industries, development of Japanese trade with other countries, and access to sources of raw materials.

If the conference had adopted these amendments, the peace treaty with Japan could have become a strong foundation for lasting peace in the Far East.

However, this is precisely not what the convener of this conference intended. What did the peace treaty conference with Japan show? It showed that the US and British governments convened this conference in order to deceive the participants into accepting the draft treaty they drafted. The United States and Britain used various coercive measures to make the participants say only a few short words praising the draft, but they immediately revealed that the draft had serious shortcomings and that not every point was to their liking. Despite this, they voted in favor of the draft.

However, this fact should not be overestimated. Since it controls a compliant majority, it is not difficult to use mechanical voting methods at the conference to pass any proposal or reject any suggestion, no matter how reasonable the suggestion may be.

For example, it was not difficult for the organizational drive of this conference to lead the majority of delegates to reject the Soviet proposal to invite the People's Republic of China to attend this conference. But this vote in no way changed the fact that the government of the People's Republic of China represents the will of the 500 million Chinese people, and the Chinese people have proven by their actions that they know how to defend their rights, and whether the initiators of this conference are willing or not, they must consider this fact.

The organizers of the conference used the same compliant majority to reject the Soviet amendments and supplements to the draft treaty.

However, those who made it possible for these amendments to be rejected had to further expose themselves as insatiable imperialists in front of the people (including the people of Asian countries), who even now, when discussing peace with Japan, are laying the foundation for another war in the Far East.

Can the Soviet Union participate in such things? Of course not. If the Soviet Union had not declared to everyone that it not only had nothing to do with these plans to prepare for another war in the Far East, but also held those who forcibly concluded this peace treaty with Japan fully responsible for the consequences of this action, then the Soviet Union would not have fulfilled its responsibility."

After making this statement, Gromyko answered many questions raised by reporters.

    葛罗米柯九月八日在旧金山记者招待会上的谈话
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社旧金山讯：出席旧金山对日和约会议的苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯于九月八日举行记者招待会，到记者三百人。葛罗米柯说：
    “苏联代表团在会议上的发言，已对美英对日和约草案作了估价，说明这个草案不能作为远东真正媾和的基础。它不能够成为那种不容许日本军国主义抬头、保证亚洲和远东各国的和平与安全，满足曾受日本侵略之害的人民的正当要求，而同时又保证恢复日本的主权和独立的媾和的基础。
    美英对日和约草案中没有防止日本军国主义复活的保证，而提供这种保证应当是对日媾和的基本任务之一。但是所有曾经参加对日战争的国家都承认提供防止日本再度成为侵略国家的保证是必要的，认为这种保证是远东媾和的基本原则之一。这正是一九四五年七月二十六日波茨坦公告以及远东委员会根据这个公告通过的决定中所规定的主要任务。
    与上述远东媾和的基本原则相反，美英对日和约草案和一九四七年在欧洲签订的一切和约——特别是对意和约不同，其中没有对日本的武装力量加以限制，也没有一般防止日本军国主义复活的保证。
    但是经验证明，日本军国主义者一旦开始策划对其任何邻国进行侵略，他们就立即迅速增加他们的武装力量。
    这可以从以下的事例中得到证明：
    日本在一九零四年进攻俄国以后，很快就把它的陆军增至两百七十五万人。
    一九二○年，日本为了在远东干涉苏联，并夺取苏联远东的领土，曾从它当时所有的二十一个师中派出了十一个步兵师，约有十七万五千人，并派出了大批的军舰和陆战队。
    一九三一年日本军队开始进侵满洲的时候，日本有二十万陆军，并迅速建立了一支庞大海军，包括主力舰十艘、航空母舰四艘，巡洋舰三十八艘、驱逐舰一百零二艘、潜水艇五十八艘、其他军舰一百余艘。
    在一九三七年进攻中国以前，日本迅速地把军队几乎扩充到四十万人。这时候日本海军的构成已经改组，军舰增至三百艘以上，总排水量达一百一十三万吨。
    在准备在太平洋上进行大规模侵略战争以夺取外国领土与奴役许多亚洲国家的时候，日本将军队扩充到三百二十万人，并在一九四一年十二月初将海军改组。海军有战舰与辅助舰四百零三艘，总排水量一百四十万吨，人员超过六十万名。
    到战争结束时（一九四五年八月），日本陆军已近六百万人，海军计有舰只五百艘以上，人员近一百七十万名。
    苏联代表团以及波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表团已经充分说明了美英和约草案的真象。苏联代表团已在它的发言里说明，这并不是媾和的草案，而是在远东准备另一次战争的草案。从他们的草案里，可以明显地看出，美英政府对日本是别有用心。他们决意要为日本军国主义的复活开辟一条宽阔的道路，这使曾遭受日本侵略之害的国家，主要是使日本的邻国再次受到威胁。
    美英和约草案不仅为日本军国主义的复活廓清了一条宽阔的道路，而且要把日本变为美国的军事基地，因为草案甚至规定日本现在就有奉献出日本领土供美国驻军的义务。实际上草案是使美军继续占领日本。因此，日本是被看成美国的一块军事跳板了。在这种情况下来谈日本主权是可能的吗？显然，在这种情况下；在美英和约草案下面的日本主权，和例如陷在美国军事基地网里面的菲律宾的主权是不会有多大差别的。
    最后，还应该指出：美英对日和约草案规定把日本拖进正在美国卵翼下建立起来的侵略性军事联盟。
    每个人都清楚，成立这些联盟是为了对付那些国家。委托杜勒斯这样的老牌战争贩子来起草对日和约并不是一件偶然的事，他像一个干得起劲的旅行推销员一样，周游某些国家的首都，好把美国所中意的和约草案冒充真货，卖给那些国家的政府。
    所有这一切表明了美英和约草案的起草人是抱着侵略的目的，并且表明了这个草案隐藏着帝国主义的贪得无厌的计划。和约草案的发起人和美国某些附庸国在会议上所作的虚假的和伪善的声明是掩盖不了这个事实的。这特别是指美国的代表，他们在会议上自吹自擂的演说和他们的粗暴和骄横的行为，进一步暴露了美国政府的政策是与和平为敌的。
    硬说把上述条款列入和约全是为日本自卫着想，这种辩解只有头脑简单的或是完全无知的人才会相信。
    谁都知道，日本并没有受到任何国家的威胁，好多世纪以来它就从来没有受到过别人的攻击，而日本军国主义者却屡次对其邻国进行侵略。所谓自卫，其实只是为了掩盖美英对日和约草案的前述军事条款，这些条款是针对着与日本毗邻的国家，首先是苏联和中华人民共和国。美英对日和约草案里所规定的军事协定，排斥像中华人民共和国和苏联这样的国家参加，这个事实也就说明了这一点。
    苏联政府早就指出：与日本缔结单独和约，是不能容许的。但是，旧金山会议所干的，却正是缔结单独的对日和约。每一个有理智的人都一定很清楚地知道，如果没有日本最近的邻国之一中华人民共和国参加，远东的真正媾和是不可能的。中国人民在反对日本侵略者的斗争中曾受到重大的损失，对于打败日本军国主义者，贡献最大。因此，中国人民要求确立远东的真正和平，是理所当然的。因此，中国人民有不容争辩的权利参加对日和约的准备和签订。
    假如美国和英国政府真的力求确立远东的和平，它们便应该设法在对日和约问题上，与中华人民共和国取得协议。谁都知道，对日和约草案的起草人并不曾作过这种努力。不仅如此，当苏联代表团在会上建议邀请中华人民共和国以平等资格出席会议时，这个建议却在美国的横暴压力下被否决了。这是对中国人民最不公道的行动。毫无疑问，中国五亿人民不会忘记这种严重侵犯他们的不容争辩的权利的行为。这样，就造成了这样一个局面：在反对日本军国主义者的斗争中担子最重的中国人民在会议上没有代表，而对日和约的问题，却在一个其参与国家绝大多数都不曾参加对日作战的会议上解决了。
    会议发起人作了这样的安排，例如像萨尔瓦多和尼加拉瓜这样的国家都参加了解决对日和约问题，而中国却没有参加。这种荒谬的情形，只有瞎子才看不见。很显然，某些出席会议的国家是否在对日和约上签字，那是没有什么关系的。但是，如果中华人民共和国没有在和约上签字，那就完全不同了。应当指出，没有出席会议的亚洲国家，还不仅中国而已。亚洲第二个最大的和重要的国家印度以及缅甸也认为不能参加会议的工作，因为它们不能同意美英对日和约草案，这个草案是与亚洲各国人民的利益根本相矛盾的。
    至于苏联，事实和美国代表的断言正好相反，苏联政府关于对日和约根本没有得到谘商，而且当苏联政府提出某些关于对日和约的意见或建议时，美国政府对这些意见或建议竟不予考虑。这就是说，虽然美国政府口头上硬说要和苏联取得协议，可是它过去不愿现在也不愿和苏联取得协议。
    人人都明白，如果没有苏联参加，远东问题的和平解决也是不可能的。
    如果提出和约草案的美英两国政府竟然认为可以在这种情况下缔结对日和约，那只能是因为它们坚持不要日本的主要邻国参加而偏和日本缔结单独和约的方针；因为它们的目的不是建立远东和平，而是发动另一次战争，在这战争中，它们打算利用日本充当它们帝国主义侵略计划的工具。
    所有这一切，只能使那些曾受日本侵略之害的国家产生理所当然的焦虑。无疑地，日本人民对于被人利用为实现美国远东侵略计划而充当炮灰的前途，也是感到很不安的。苏联代表团收到日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会的呼吁书一件（这一呼吁书也已经分别送给美、英、法、印度的政府）。这一呼吁书说，日本已有五百万人签名抗议哄骗日本的单独和约。又说：如果首相吉田所率领的日本代表团签署了这项和约，日本人民决不承认这个条约。
    苏联代表团还收到了日本各种工会组织寄来的一些信件，抗议把日本卷入军事冒险的行动，抗议单独和约。
    简单地说，美英对日和约草案是美国政府与日本现政府之间的密约，而日本现政府是被美国缚住了手脚，因此是不能表达日本人民的意见的。
    日本现政府首相吉田在会议上的发言表明：在日本，并不是所有的人都已经了解建立与维持正常和平关系，首先是与其邻国——苏联及中华人民共和国建立与维持正常和平关系的必要性。日本首相力图为日本政府与美国的勾结并借此把日本变成美国军事基地的行为辩解，他重述惯用的诽谤谰言，说什么日本“受到来自北方的威胁”，虽然这种谰言的荒谬无稽是很显然的。
    上述的信件和呼吁书证实了无可置辩的事实：美国政府在日本执行它的军事计划时，它所凭借的恰恰是已经多次把日本推上侵略道路的那个军事集团，而不是日本的民主势力。这正说明了为什么美英对日和约草案中没有任何可以保障日本人民的基本民主权利和自由的条款，没有任何不容许任何军国主义团体复活的条款。一九四七年在欧洲所缔结的一切和约都列有这种条款，因为它们是直接根据波茨坦公告而制定的，可是美英对日和约草案却没有这种条款。
    至于领土问题，更是普遍都知道，美英对日和约草案严重地侵犯了中国对于台湾（福摩萨）、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛和其他岛屿的权利，这些岛屿历来就是中国的领土；只是由于日本侵略的结果才从中国割去的。
    所有这些都是蔑视这一事实的，即这个草案的起草人——美英两国政府已在开罗宣言和波茨坦公告上承认了中国对这些领土的无可争辩的权利，并且承担了保证这一权利之运用的义务。
    和约草案起草人打算用这种作法，使美国由于直接侵略中华人民共和国的结果而侵占台湾（福摩萨）的行为合法化。
    同时，尽管美英两国政府曾在开罗宣言上庄严声明它们决不为自己而征服他人，亦无拓展领土之意，然而美英草案起草人却与开罗宣言相反，打算以交给联合国托管为藉口，使若干群岛（琉球、小笠原及其他）脱离日本而给予美国，虽然美国对这些岛屿并无权利可言。
    美国政府的这个要求是出于扩张主义的贪欲。
    苏联代表团已经提醒会议注意，对日和约草案中竟丝毫没有提到日本必须承认苏联对库页岛南部和千岛群岛的主权，这种情况是不能容许的。这一草案是与美国和英国根据雅尔塔协定关于这些领土的协议所担负的义务完全矛盾的。
    大家知道，苏联代表团曾在会议上对美英草案提出了若干修正案和补充，这些修正案和补充充分表明了苏联政府对于对日和约问题所持的态度。
    这些修正案是有关下列最重要的问题的：
    （一）防止日本军国主义的复活。
    （二）自日本领土撤退外国占领军，防止在日本领土上建立外国军事基地。
    （三）防止日本参加以任何对日作战国家为对象的联盟或军事同盟。
    （四）严格按照关于这个问题的现有国际协定来解决领土问题。
    （五）保证日本人民享有民主权利和自由。
    （六）毫无阻碍地发展日本和平工业，发展日本与其他国家的贸易，使它获得原料的来源。
    如果会议通过了这些修正案，对日和约原可以成为远东持久和平的强固基础。
    但是，这正是不合这个会议的召集者的打算的。对日和约会议表现出什么呢？它表现出：美英政府召集这个会议为的是欺骗与会者接受这个由它们草拟的和约草案。美国和英国使用了各种强制手段，使与会者只说出短短的几句歌颂这个草案的话，然而他们当即又流露出：这个草案有严重的缺点，并不是每一点都合他们的心意的。尽管这样，他们还是投票赞成这个草案。
    可是，对这一事实，不应该估计过高。既然掌握了唯命是从的多数，便不难在会议上使用机械投票的方法，通过任何提案或者否决任何建议，不管这个建议多么合理。
    举例说，这一会议的组织性驱使多数代表否决苏联所提邀请中华人民共和国出席这个会议的建议，并没有多大困难。但是这种表决丝毫也没有改变这样的事实：中华人民共和国政府是代表五亿中国人民的意志的，中国人民已经以他们的行动证明了：他们是知道如何保卫他们的权利的，不论这次会议的发起人愿意与否，他们必须考虑这个事实。
    会议的组织者使用了同一个唯命是从的多数来做到否决苏联所提和约草案修正案与补充。
    然而，那些使这些修正案得以被否决了的人们，却不得不在人民面前（包括亚洲各国人民在内），更多地暴露了他们是贪得无厌的帝国主义者，即使在现在讨论对日媾和的时候，他们也是在远东为另一次战争奠定基础。
    有人问苏联能参加这种事情吗？它当然不能。如果苏联没有向每个人都声明：它不仅跟在远东准备另一战争的这些计划毫无关系，而且还要那些强行订立这种对日和约的人们对这种行动的后果负全部责任，那末，苏联便不称是尽到了它的责任。”
    葛罗米柯在发表这一声明后，又回答了记者们所提出的许多问题。
