The reform movement of the Catholic Church in Beijing, after more than four months of efforts by the broad masses of patriotic Catholics, has achieved great success. During this period, we held study sessions, discussion sessions, recollection sessions, and accusation meetings of various sizes, and relentlessly exposed and accused the imperialist elements, secret agents, and despots hidden within the church. Catholics have become even more clearly aware that not only are there many imperialist elements and their lackeys in Catholic churches in other places who have carried out many destructive activities that endanger our motherland, but also that many imperialist elements and their lackeys are hidden in our Catholic churches in Beijing. For many years, they have relied on imperialist forces to control the churches, usurp divine power, commit all kinds of evils, and carry out various destructive activities. The harm they have done to our motherland, our people, and all Catholics is truly indescribable. We can no longer tolerate these criminals hiding in the church, continuing to insult our Catholic faith, and continuing to use Catholicism to endanger our motherland and our people. In order to love our motherland, in order to love our church, we must resolutely carry out the self-reliance reform movement, completely sever all ties with imperialism, and expel all imperialist elements and their lackeys from the church. We, the representatives, now unanimously decide:

One, continue to fight against imperialist elements and their lackeys, and completely remove them from the Catholic Church; destroy the "Legion of Mary" and "Rosicrucian Order" which are dedicated to being enemies of the Chinese people; and continue to expose and reveal all imperialist elements and imperialist lackeys within the church. Every patriotic Catholic must heighten vigilance and resolutely strike at the evil activities of imperialists who are sabotaging our motherland and sabotaging the Catholic reform movement.

Two, resolutely support the Central People's Government and support the Common Program, abide by and implement all policies and decrees of the People's Government; the People's Government is our own government, and we Catholics must actively respond to all calls from the People's Government.

Three, actively participate in all patriotic activities, and support and actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. In the future, we Catholics must actively participate in all undertakings that are beneficial to the motherland and the people.

Four, eliminate all influences and ideological toxins that imperialists and their lackeys have spread in our church for a long time that endanger the Chinese people and endanger our motherland. Launch a patriotic study movement to love the motherland, love the people, and love labor; clearly establish the idea of hating, despising, and scorning imperialism, enhance national self-esteem, and truly liberate all Catholics ideologically.

    北京市天主教革新代表会议
    关于继续深入展开革新运动的决议
    我们北京市天主教的革新运动，经过广大爱国教友四个多月的努力，业已获得巨大成就。在此期间，我们召开了大小不同的学习会、讨论会、回忆会和控诉会，对掩藏在教内的帝国主义分子、特务间谍和恶霸进行了无情的揭发与控诉。教友们更加清楚地认识：不仅其他各地天主教内有许多帝国主义分子及其走狗们作了许多危害我们祖国的破坏活动，而且就在我们北京各个天主堂内也暗藏着许多帝国主义分子和他们的走狗。他们多年以来依仗帝国主义势力，控制教堂，窃据神权，为非作恶，进行各种破坏活动。他们对于我们祖国和人民以及全体教友的危害，真是难以言语形容的。我们再也不能容忍这些罪犯藏在教里，继续污辱我们的天主教，并继续利用天主教危害我们的祖国和人民。为了爱护我们的祖国，为了爱护我们的教会，我们必须坚决进行自立革新运动，彻底斩断与帝国主义的一切联系，驱除一切帝国主义分子和他们的走狗们出教。我们全体代表现在一致决定：
    一，继续向帝国主义分子和他们的走狗们作斗争，要把他们从天主教内澈底清除出去；要摧毁专门与中国人民为敌的“圣母军”和“玫瑰十字军”；要继续检举与揭发教内一切帝国主义分子和帝国主义的走狗。每一个爱国教友必须提高警惕，坚决打击帝国主义者破坏我们的祖国和破坏天主教革新运动的罪恶活动。
    二，坚决拥护中央人民政府和拥护共同纲领，遵守与执行人民政府的一切政策法令；人民政府是我们自己的政府，对于人民政府的一切号召，我们天主教徒都要积极起来响应。
    三，积极参加一切爱国活动，拥护并积极参加抗美援朝运动。今后凡是对祖国对人民有益的事业，我们天主教徒都要积极参加。
    四，要肃清帝国主义及其走狗们长期在我们教内所散布的一切危害中国人民、危害我们祖国的影响和思想毒素。开展爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动的爱国主义学习运动；明确树立仇视、鄙视、蔑视帝国主义的思想，提高民族自尊心，使全体教友真正从思想上解放出来。
