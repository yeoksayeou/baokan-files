    Carry out mass health publicity work and improve the political and ideological level of health publicity work
    Hu Tiancheng
    Continuously and universally improving the health knowledge level of the people is the concrete practice of preventive health work among the broad masses of the people. To improve the people's health knowledge level, it is necessary to conduct health publicity and education work in a guided and systematic manner, in conjunction with current political tasks, extensively and in-depth.
    Health publicity and education work is an indispensable part of health construction work to connect with the masses, an important link in carrying out social health work, and also a part of natural science popularization education. To do this work well, it is necessary to have a high degree of ideological and combat effectiveness, master the materialistic natural science viewpoint, criticize the idealistic thought of blindly worshiping capitalist natural science, eliminate feudal superstitions about disease phenomena, keenly experience the actual living conditions of the broad masses of the people, and closely integrate with the actual needs of national construction. Only in this way will health publicity work have political significance. It is not enough to merely explain medical theories abstractly and simply disseminate health knowledge.
    To achieve this task, health publicity personnel must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improve their political and ideological level, study their profession, possess broad social knowledge, and constantly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to improve this work.
    The development of health publicity and education work cannot be done well by a few professionals alone. It is necessary to rely on the masses, mobilize and organize all health workers, and make them consciously and enthusiastically participate in this work. At the same time, it is also necessary to spread health decrees, policies, and health knowledge through the cultural and publishing circles. In this way, a huge health publicity force can be formed, thereby discovering talents, cultivating backbones, and promoting this work.
    Health publicity and education work is a mass activity. Comrades who do publicity work must be good at organizing the masses and encouraging them to participate in this activity. The objects of organization and encouragement are primarily health workers, so that they consciously and enthusiastically participate in health publicity work and regard it as their glorious task. To achieve this, it is first necessary to strengthen patriotic political and ideological education among health personnel, overcome the purely technical viewpoint, and make them actively participate in social activities.
    In terms of methods of conducting health publicity work, we can promote health lectures and blackboard newspaper campaigns. Health lectures can start from cities, with medical school professors, hospital department doctors, and professionals in health administrative agencies as the main speakers. Conducted through radio stations, factories, mines, agencies, schools, and citizen gatherings, we can gain experience and gradually promote it to rural areas. As for health blackboard newspapers, this work can not only be a regular activity of health work units themselves, but also can be vigorously promoted in cities and vast rural areas through primary school teachers and middle-grade students, based on certain publicity points and reference content. In addition, holding health exhibitions and showing slides for health publicity work can be welcomed by the broad masses of the people and achieve great results. In cities, health publicity windows can also be set up in private clinics.
    To widely carry out health publicity and education work, one problem must be solved: namely, supplying publicity materials and transmitting the reflections from the masses to the leading organs. To solve this problem, it is necessary to carry out text editing and publishing work.
    Since liberation, the number of health publications (including health drawings) in various parts of the country is not small, and there are also many successful works, which have played a great role in cooperating to complete the current health work tasks. However, many publications lack systematic and strict editing and reviewing work. Some of the things printed even have many errors. This is an extremely irresponsible manifestation of publishing work.
    Health publicity work is an important part of health construction work; while editing and publishing work is a decisive part of health publicity work. The first task in this work at present should be to systematically edit popular health reading materials, such as mass health series, picture albums, street health propaganda posters and wall charts, photography, slides, scripts, vaudeville, songs, etc., to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people.
    In order to complete the task of health publicity work, according to the current situation, training cadres for health publicity work is still an urgent problem to be solved. Our government, from the Central Ministry of Health to health administrative and business departments at all levels, has the staffing of health publicity organizations, which shows that the people's government attaches importance to health publicity work. However, our organizations are still very unsound, and some of our health publicity personnel, although they have full-time positions, lack professional skills. To solve this problem, we can only strive to train professional publicity cadres. Training publicity cadres must also be trained from existing on-the-job personnel or medical school students. As for the manufacture of health education equipment and the technicians who use these equipment, it is not necessary for medical personnel to be in charge, but they must be given health training. And those engaged in the editing of health publications, as well as health publicity administrative business personnel, need to be selected from on-the-job medical personnel or medical school students, and then given professional training.

    开展群众卫生宣传工作，提高卫生宣传工作的政治思想水平
    胡田成
    不断而又普遍地提高人民大众卫生知识水平，乃是预防为主的卫生工作，在广大人民群众中的具体实践。要提高人民卫生知识水平，就须有领导地、有系统地，结合当前的政治任务，广泛深入地开展卫生宣传教育工作。
    卫生宣传教育工作，是卫生建设工作中借以联系群众而不可缺少的工作，是开展社会卫生工作的一个重要环节，同时又是自然科学普及教育的一部分。要做好这个工作，需要有高度的思想性和战斗性，掌握唯物主义自然科学观点，批判盲目崇拜资本主义自然科学的唯心主义思想，破除对于疾病现象的封建迷信，敏锐的体验广大人民生活的实际情况，并和国家建设的实际需要密切地相结合起来。这样卫生宣教工作，才有政治意义。如果仅仅是抽象地解说医药理论和单纯传播卫生常识，这是不够的。
    要达成这个任务，卫生宣教人员，就必须加强马列主义和毛泽东思想的学习，提高政策思想水平，钻研业务，并具备广博的社会知识，经常不断地掌握批评与自我批评的武器，来改进这一工作。
    卫生宣传教育工作的开展，决非少数专业人员可以做好的，必须依靠群众，把全体卫生工作者发动和组织起来，使他们自觉地踊跃参加这一工作。同时还须通过文化界、出版界……传播卫生政令、政策以及卫生知识。这样就可以形成巨大的卫生宣教力量，从而发现人才，培养骨干，来推动这一工作。
    卫生宣传教育工作，是群众性的活动，做宣教工作的同志，就必须善于组织群众，鼓舞群众参加这一活动。而组织和鼓动的对象，首先就是从事卫生工作的人员，使他们自觉的踊跃参加卫生宣教工作，并以此作为自己的光荣的任务。要做到这一点，首先就要在卫生人员中，加强爱国主义的政治思想教育，克服单纯技术观点，使他们积极参加社会活动。
    在进行卫生宣教工作的方法上，我们可以推广卫生讲演和黑板报运动。卫生讲演，可先从城市开始，把医学院教授，医院分科医生，以及卫生行政机关中的专业人员做为主讲人。通过广播电台、工矿、机关、学校及市民集会场合去进行，取得经验，逐渐推广到农村。至于卫生黑板报，这个工作不仅卫生工作单位本身可当做经常的活动，同时还可以通过小学教师、中年级学生，根据一定的宣传要点和参考内容，在城市及广大农村中均可大力推广。此外，举办卫生展览会，以及放映幻灯进行卫生宣教工作，可以受到广大群众的欢迎，获得极大的效果。在城市中，还可举办开业诊所的卫生宣传窗。
    广泛的开展卫生宣传教育工作，有一个问题必须求得解决：即供应宣教材料，把来自群众的反映传达给领导机关。要解决这个问题，就需要进行文字的编辑出版工作。
    解放后，全国各地卫生出版物（包括卫生画图）不算太少，也有不少成功的作品，在配合完成当前卫生工作任务上起了很大作用。但是，也有不少的出版物缺乏有系统的严格的编审工作。甚至有些印出来的东西错误百出。这是出版工作极不负责任的表现。
    卫生宣教工作，是卫生建设工作中的重要一环；而编辑出版工作，则又是卫生宣传工作中有决定意义的一环。这个工作在目前首先应该有系统地编辑卫生通俗读物，如大众卫生丛书、画册、街头卫生宣传画和挂图、摄影，幻灯片、剧本、杂耍、歌曲等的编制，以适应广大群众的需要。
    为了完成卫生宣教工作的任务，根据目前的情况，培养卫生宣教工作的干部，还是一个急待解决的问题。我们的政府，从中央卫生部到各级卫生行政业务部门，都有卫生宣教组织的编制，这表示人民政府是重视卫生宣教工作的。但是我们的组织还十分不健全，在我们的卫生宣教人员中，有的虽有专职，而缺乏专业能力。要解决这个问题，就只有努力培养专业宣教工作干部。培养宣教干部，也须从现有的在职人员或医科学校的学员来培养。至于卫生教育器材的制造和使用这些器材的技术人员，不一定要由医务人员来担任，但须给予卫生方面的训练。而从事卫生出版物的编辑工作人员，以及卫生宣教行政业务人员，就需要从在职医务人员或医校学员中去挑选，再给予专业训练。
