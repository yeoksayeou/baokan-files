    Cooperative Cadres Must Always Care About the Needs of the Masses

    In Xiaojing Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, and Dong'an Township, Hangzhou County, there are supply and marketing cooperatives. Due to the different service spirit of the cadres in the two cooperatives, the benefits received by the members of the two cooperatives are also very different.

    The Xiaojing Township Cooperative, in order to supplement farm tools for its members, convened a meeting of member representatives and group leaders. After investigation and statistics, it purchased 500 new sickles needed for harvesting early rice and hired three blacksmiths to repair 831 old sickles. The repair costs alone saved the members more than 332,000 yuan, which was warmly welcomed by the members of the masses.

    The Dong'an Township Cooperative did not do well in this work. Many members of the township grow jute, and all the members have long requested the cooperative to supply "jaws" for stripping hemp in a timely manner (an average of two "jaws" are needed for every 100 jin of jute, and about 166,600 "jaws" are needed for the whole township). However, the cadres and directors of the cooperative lacked the spirit of serving the members, and they had not started purchasing them by August 25, on the eve of the jute harvest. In urgent need, the members had to go to the market to buy "jaws" at a price of 400 yuan each, while the cost was only 150 yuan each, and they had to suffer a lot of intermediate exploitation.

    Cooperatives are the economic organizations of the masses themselves. Their work is to assist state-owned trading institutions, handle affairs for the members of the masses, and closely integrate the broad masses with the state in economic life. Only by starting from caring about the production and life of the masses can the cooperative gain the support of the masses and consolidate and expand the organization of the cooperative. As early as 1934, Chairman Mao instructed us: "All practical life problems of the masses are problems that we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and meet the needs of the masses, we will truly become the organizers of the lives of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us and warmly support us." ("Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods")

### 合作社干部要时刻关心群众的需要

    合作社干部要时刻关心群众的需要
    浙江富阳县宵井乡和杭县东安乡各有一个供销合作社，由于两个社的干部的服务精神不同，两个社的社员所得到的好处也大不相同。
    宵井乡合作社为给社员增补农具，曾召开了社员代表、小组长会，经过调查统计，采购收割早稻所需的新镰刀五百把，雇铁匠三人修理旧镰刀八百三十一把。只修理费一项就为社员节省了三十三万二千余元，得到社员群众热烈拥护。
    东安乡合作社在这项工作中却没有做好。该乡种植络麻的很多，全乡社员早就要求合作社及时供应剥麻器具“挟筒”（平均一百斤络麻需“挟筒”两根，全乡约需十六万六千余根）。但合作社的干部和理监事缺乏为社员服务的精神，到八月二十五日络麻收割的前夕，还没有着手采购。社员在急迫需要的情况下只好以四百元一根的代价，到市场上去买成本仅一百五十元一根的“挟筒”，不得不受许多中间剥削。
    合作社是群众自己的经济组织，它的工作就是做国营贸易机构的助手，替社员群众办事，把广大社员从经济生活上和国家紧密地结合起来。合作社也只有从关心群众的生产和生活出发，才能得到群众的拥护，才能把合作社的组织巩固和扩大起来。这个道理，毛主席早在一九三四年就曾指示我们：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”（“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”）
