Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: American imperialism is conspiring to use Japan's disguised army "Police Reserve Force" to supervise the Kuomintang remnant bandit troops in Taiwan, attempting to boost the morale of the disintegrating bandit troops. According to a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Hong Kong on the 11th: The head of the American Military Mission in Taiwan, Chase, recently visited Tokyo and suggested to the Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in Tokyo, Ridgway, that Japanese police be used to "boost" the "morale" of Chiang Kai-shek's army in Taiwan.

According to reliable sources here, Chase told Ridgway that the Kuomintang army was in a state of complete disintegration in terms of morale and politics.

Chase said: Chiang Kai-shek's army has no discipline. In the past three months alone, more than 2,000 soldiers have deserted. At the same time, many Kuomintang officers and officials are engaged in speculative trading of American weapons and equipment, a well-known fact that continues to contribute to the deterioration of morale.

A particularly fatal factor undermining morale is the hostile attitude of the local people of Taiwan towards the Kuomintang army. The people of Taiwan accuse them of betraying the Chinese people.

Chase believes that the most urgent need for Chiang Kai-shek's army is to strengthen the discipline of officers and soldiers and improve the army's combat morale. Chase believes that Chiang Kai-shek's army will only be useful in the future after being reorganized according to the American model. He advocated paying special attention to selecting personnel to serve as military police and selecting new cadres to serve as junior officers.

Among the many measures Chase suggested to Ridgway to improve the morale of the Kuomintang army, one was: Ridgway should send several thousand soldiers and sergeants from the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" to Taiwan. This will be implemented in accordance with the agreement recently concluded between New York Governor Dewey, who actually represented the State Department and the Department of Defense in inspecting Asia, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida.

According to Chase's suggestion, Kuomintang naval ships will be incorporated into the US Seventh Fleet, and the overall command of the Kuomintang army will be concentrated in the hands of an American general.

    美国阴谋用变相日军监督台湾的残余匪军
    【新华社十六日讯】美帝国主义阴谋利用日本变相的陆军“警察后备队”监督台湾国民党残余匪军，妄图借以提高趋于瓦解的匪军士气。据电通社香港十一日航讯：美国驻台湾军事使团团长蔡斯最近访问东京时，曾向东京美军总司令李奇微建议，以日本警察来“振作”台湾蒋介石军队的“士气”。
    据此间可靠人士报道，蔡斯告诉李奇微，国民党军队在士气上和政治上已处于全部瓦解的状态。
    蔡斯说：蒋介石的军队没有纪律。仅在过去三个月中，就有二千余兵士开小差。同时，国民党许多军官和官吏都在从事美国武器与装备的投机买卖，这个众所共知的事实不断地助长士气的败坏。
    使士气败坏的特别致命的因素是台湾本地人民对国民党军队的仇视态度。台湾人民指责他们背叛中国人民。
    蔡斯认为，蒋介石军队最迫切需要的是加强官兵的纪律与提高军队的战斗士气。蔡斯相信，蒋介石军队只有依照美国方式整编后，在将来才能有用处。他主张要特别注意遴选人员充当宪兵，遴选新干部充当下级军官。
    蔡斯向李奇微建议的提高国民党军队士气的许多措施中，有一个是：李奇微应该派日本“警察后备队”的几千士兵和军士到台湾去。这将依照最近实际上代表国务院和国防部视察亚洲的纽约州州长杜威同日本首相吉田所缔结的协定来执行。
    依照蔡斯的建议，国民党海军舰只将并入美国第七舰队，国民党军队的总指挥权将集中在一个美国将领之手。
