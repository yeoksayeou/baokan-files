    Rebuking the US Side's Provocative Actions

    Following the murder of Yao Qingxiang, a platoon leader of our military police in the Kaesong neutral zone on August 19th, and the bombing of the residence of our delegation in Kaesong on August 22nd, the American aggressors committed new attacks and bombings in the Kaesong neutral zone on August 30th and September 1st. These increasingly frantic and shameless crimes of the American aggressors further prove their insidious plot to deliberately sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. If the August 19th incident in which the US side killed Yao Qingxiang and others in the Kaesong neutral zone was merely the result of a "sneak attack," then the August 30th incident was a blatant attack on the Kaesong neutral zone by US armed forces equipped with heavy artillery, during which they shamelessly murdered Yang Xianzhe and Zhang Renfeng, our military police serving in the neutral zone, and seriously injured Zheng Zhongnan.

    Similarly, Li Qiwei is already at a loss for words and dares not reinvestigate the August 22nd incident of US aircraft bombing and strafing near the dormitory of our delegation at the Kaesong meeting site; from August 23rd to August 30th, US aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone twelve times, constantly conducting reconnaissance and harassment; on the 29th, a US aircraft dropped flares in the Kaesong neutral zone, and then on September 1st, US aircraft bombed General Nan Ri's residence, plotting to murder the chief representative of our negotiating delegation. What excuses can the American aggressors make for this series of planned crimes?

    As people expected, the American representatives still claimed that these were not American aircraft, and implied that it was the Korean-Chinese side bombing their own chief representative. But no one in the world, except madmen, would believe the absurd rumors of these inhuman American bandits.

    The people of the world must resolutely condemn these endless and intolerable provocative actions by the American aggressors. From this series of provocative actions, people must more clearly recognize that the American aggressors not only have no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, but on the contrary, they are clearly creating an atmosphere of war throughout the world for despicable purposes. The Korean and Chinese people have all the determination and preparation, and are not afraid of any intimidation or provocation from US imperialism, but the Korean and Chinese people must fully expose the wolfish face of the American aggressor bandits to the world, so that they may immediately be judged by all righteous humanity. The presidents, ministers, and generals of the United States are a bunch of cold-blooded murderers! Sanction these murderers!

### 斥美方的挑衅行动

    斥美方的挑衅行动
    美国侵略者继八月十九日谋杀开城中立区我方军事警察姚庆祥排长、八月二十二日轰炸开城我方代表团住所之后，又在八月三十日和九月一日在开城中立区制造了新的袭击和轰炸案件。美国侵略者的这种日益疯狂无耻的罪行，更进一步证明了美国侵略者蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判的狠毒阴谋。如果说八月十九日美方在开城中立区杀害姚庆祥等的事件，还只是一种“偷袭”行为的结果，那末，八月三十日的事件，则是美方重火器配备的武装部队对开城中立区的公然进攻，他们又无耻地杀害了在中立区服务的我方军事警察杨显泽、张仁凤，并使郑重男受了重伤。
    同样，对于八月二十二日美方飞机轰炸和扫射开城会址区我方代表团宿舍附近的事件，李奇微已经理屈词穷，不敢复查；而从八月二十三日到八月三十日，美方飞机先后十二次侵入开城中立区上空，不断侦察骚扰；二十九日美机一架又在开城中立区投掷照明弹，接着美机就在九月一日轰炸了南日将军的住所，阴谋杀害我方谈判代表团的首席代表，这一连串的有计划的罪行，美国侵略者还能作什么狡赖呢？
    如人们所预料，美国的代表仍然宣称这不是美国方面的飞机，并暗示这是朝中方面的飞机自己轰炸自己的首席代表。但是全世界除了疯子，决不会听信这批灭绝人性的美国匪徒们的荒谬谣言。
    对于美国侵略者的这种无休止的不可容忍的挑衅行动，全世界人民都要坚决加以斥责。从这一连串的挑衅行动中，人们更要清楚地认识，美国侵略者不但没有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，而且相反的，它显然正在为着卑鄙的目的，在全世界制造战争空气。朝中人民具有一切决心和准备，不害怕美帝国主义的任何威吓和挑衅，但是朝中人民必须把美国侵略匪徒的豺狼面目尽情告诉全世界，使他们立即受到全体正义人类的裁判。美国的总统们，部长们，将军们就是这样一批杀人不眨眼的凶手！制裁这批凶手！
