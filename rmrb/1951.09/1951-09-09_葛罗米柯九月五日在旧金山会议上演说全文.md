Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: TASS, San Francisco, September 7th: Gromyko delivered a speech at the San Francisco Conference on September 5, 1951. The full text is as follows:

    Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:
    The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary from the outset to emphasize the importance of the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. Many countries represented at this conference have suffered Japanese aggression. This is especially true of the People's Republic of China, whose people fought alone for a long time against the Japanese aggressors who invaded their territory. This fact alone makes the importance of this issue obvious.
    As early as 1931, Japanese troops invaded Manchuria.
    After occupying Manchuria for six years and turning it into a springboard for expanding aggression on the Asian continent, militarist Japan invaded central China in 1937, occupying China's vital central areas. The Chinese people suffered tremendous losses in both manpower and material resources in their struggle against Japanese aggression.
    In their struggle against Japanese aggression, the Chinese people defended their independence, shouldered the main burden of the struggle against this aggression, and made an inestimable contribution to the final victory of freedom-loving peoples, thereby accelerating it.
    It is well known that thirteen years ago, militarist Japan attacked the Soviet Union in the Lake Khasan area near Vladivostok. Although the Japanese militarists suffered a deserved defeat, they did not abandon their conspiracy to invade the Soviet Union. In 1939, the Japanese invading army launched another offensive in another area—near the Khalkhin Gol area of the Mongolian People's Republic—intending to rush towards Soviet territory. Although the Japanese militarists once again received a deserved defeat from the Soviet army, everyone knows that they still did not abandon their conspiracy to invade the Soviet Union, and made no secret of their goal of seizing the Soviet Far East.
    Several other countries in Asia and the Far East, including India, Burma, Indonesia, and the Philippines, have also suffered Japanese aggression.
    Finally, the American people are also familiar with Japanese aggression, because the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor—the American naval base in the Pacific—is still fresh in their memories. This attack on the United States expanded the scale of Japanese aggression. After this, Japanese militarists attacked several other countries in Asia and the Far East. The war expanded, encompassing the whole of Asia. For nearly fifteen years, Japanese militarists attacked Asian and Far Eastern countries one after another. These countries found it necessary to work together to safeguard the independence of the countries attacked by Japanese aggressors and create conditions for establishing lasting peace in the Far East. Many countries in Asia and the Far East have suffered significant losses in resisting Japanese militarists and defending their national independence.
    All of this shows that now is a good time to take advantage of the conditions created by defeating the Japanese aggressors, and also a good time to establish peace in the Far East. It is because of these considerations that the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed concrete steps to ensure that this issue is resolved. For several years, the Soviet Union has been suggesting to quickly conclude a peace treaty with Japan. Of course, the Soviet Union has always proceeded, and still proceeds, from the following premise: it should be a democratic peace that conforms to the interests of all peoples, not an imperialist peace that only benefits certain insatiable groups of imperialists. It must be a peace that truly conforms to the legitimate demands of peace-loving countries, especially those countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression, and a peace that prevents Japan from returning to being an aggressor nation.
    Thus, the issue should be to have a treaty and a reconciliation that will not allow Japanese militarism to re-emerge and can guarantee peace and security for the countries of Asia and the Far East.
    Not only are the countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression concerned about this, but also the Japanese people. The Japanese people were dragged by militarists into wars of aggression against other countries and peoples, and are now paying the price for the crimes committed by militarists. The national interests of the Japanese people demand that Japan should have peaceful relations with other countries, especially with its neighbors.
    The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to emphasize the importance of the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, because not all of the countries represented at this conference have shown concern for how to prevent a situation that would cause Japanese militarists to once again push Japan onto the path of aggression. Moreover, the American-British draft peace treaty with Japan submitted to this conference shows that the drafters of this peace treaty are more concerned with clearing the way for the revival of Japanese militarism and pushing Japan onto the path of aggression and military adventures.
    This mainly refers to the United States, whose Japanese policy in recent years has fully demonstrated that the United States government has special intentions for Japan, and that these intentions are completely contrary to the interests of a genuine peace with Japan and the interests of maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East.
    (1) On the principles that the
        peace treaty with Japan should be based
    When considering the peace treaty with Japan, the first issue that arises is what principles should this treaty be based on? How can we ensure that Japan will not become an aggressor nation again? Militarists have emerged in Japan and are openly talking about their revenge plans. How can we ensure that Japan's destiny will not fall into the hands of these militarists again? This task can be successfully completed if the representatives attending this conference adhere to the principles expressed in those famous international agreements regarding Japan—principles which, if implemented, can truly prevent the revival of Japanese militarism. This mainly refers to agreements such as the Cairo Declaration of 1943, the Potsdam Proclamation of 1945, and the Yalta Agreement of 1945. According to these agreements, the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union undertook clear obligations in ending the war against Japan, making peace with Japan, and transforming Japan into a peace-loving democratic country.
    This also refers to agreements such as the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, according to which the United Nations guaranteed not to make a separate peace with the enemy countries (including Japan); and the various decisions on basic policy towards Japan passed by the Far Eastern Commission composed of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, China, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the Philippines after the end of the war against Japan.
    Everyone knows that the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, and the Far Eastern Commission's decisions on basic policy towards Japan based on this proclamation, stipulated the elimination of Japanese militarism and the prevention of situations that would make the revival of Japanese militarism possible. The Far Eastern Commission's decision of June 19, 1947, on "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan" specifically stipulated strict restrictions on Japan in terms of military forces. The Potsdam Proclamation pointed out that the authority and influence of those who deceived and misled the Japanese people, causing them to "desire to conquer the world," must be eliminated. The Potsdam Proclamation also pointed out that measures must be taken to prevent Japan from rearming and adopting a policy of aggression.
    The agreements between countries regarding Japan stipulated the eradication of Japanese militarism and the transformation of Japan into a peace-loving country capable of maintaining normal relations with other countries and peoples, including its neighbors who suffered particularly deeply from Japanese aggression. Those who truly wish to prevent the recurrence of Japanese aggression and ensure peaceful relations between Japan and other countries will certainly desire to achieve this goal.
    Thus, the issue of eradicating Japanese militarism is one of the fundamental issues that must be resolved by the peace treaty with Japan. This primarily means that the peace treaty with Japan must include provisions limiting the strength of the Japanese armed forces—army, navy, and air force.
    Everyone knows that when Japanese militarists were preparing to invade other countries, they built up a huge army—land, sea, and air. On the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese army had 3.2 million men. At the time of Japan's surrender in August 1945, the Japanese army numbered approximately 6 million. The elite Japanese army stationed in the territory of Manchuria occupied by Japanese militarists alone—the so-called Kwantung Army—numbered nearly one million men.
    Naturally, all of these excessively bloated Japanese armed forces were maintained by plundering the working people. Following their aggressive partner, Hitler's Germany, Japanese militarists began to turn entire countries and peoples into their slaves. They cared little about the immediate interests of the Japanese people, constantly intensifying the squeeze of taxes on Japanese peasants and workers in order to extract as much money as possible for war preparations and later for conducting the war.
    Therefore, in preparing and concluding a peace treaty with Japan, it is necessary to resolve the issue of guarantees to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, and the issue of guarantees to eliminate the possibility of the recurrence of Japanese aggression.
    Needless to say, after the conclusion of the peace treaty, all occupation forces must withdraw from Japan, and foreign military bases must not be allowed to be maintained on its territory.
    The absence of clear and explicit provisions on this point in the treaty will violate the purpose of a reconciliation with Japan that should restore Japan's sovereignty, as well as the interests of maintaining peace in the Far East.
    The aforementioned agreements between countries stipulated the transformation of Japan into a democratic country.
    The Potsdam Proclamation directly and straightforwardly pointed out: "The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people." It also stipulated the establishment of freedom of speech, religion, and thought, as well as respect for basic human rights. The Far Eastern Commission's decision on "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan" declared: "The Japanese people shall be encouraged to develop a desire for individual liberties and respect for fundamental human rights, particularly freedom of religion, assembly, association, speech, and the press; and they shall be encouraged to form democratic and representative organizations."
    This is the second most important issue raised by the countries during the war against Japan, the issue of the democratic transformation of Japan. Raising this issue is completely understandable. Militaristic Japan was ruled by reactionary groups. The entire political and social life was under the control of this group and the Japanese corporations that supported it—Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and others.
    Thus, the issue of eradicating Japanese militarism and preventing its revival is inextricably linked to the issue of the democratic transformation of Japan's political and social life, and the establishment of a democratic order in Japan, so that Japan's destiny is not determined by the tyranny of a handful of reactionary militarists.
    This means that the peace treaty with Japan must contain provisions to ensure the implementation of the principle that the democratic tendencies of the Japanese people must be restored and strengthened, and that Japan must be democratically transformed in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation and other resolutions of various countries.
    A very important issue in preparing the peace treaty with Japan is the issue of developing the Japanese economy. Everyone knows that Japan's economy in the past served the militarist groups. Its development direction was to prepare Japan's industry and agriculture to meet the needs of war.
    The characteristic of Japan's pre-war and wartime economy was its militarization, which harmed the immediate interests of the Japanese people. Basic resources of industry and agriculture were used to produce weapons and strategic materials, rather than to meet the needs of civilians.
    This means that the peace treaty with Japan should contain some such provisions that, when implemented simultaneously with the restrictions on Japan's armed forces, can prevent the militarization of the Japanese economy. At the same time, the treaty should not place any obstacles in the way of the development of Japan's peaceful economy. This principle is clearly stipulated in the Potsdam Proclamation. As is well known, the four countries of the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union all signed the Potsdam Proclamation.
    Based on this principle in the Potsdam Proclamation, the Soviet government proposed to the Far Eastern Commission in September 1948 that, on the one hand, the restoration and establishment of Japan's war industry should be prohibited and corresponding controls should be established to implement this prohibition; on the other hand, the restoration and development of Japan's peaceful industry aimed at meeting the needs of the Japanese people should not be restricted, nor should the development of Japan's trade with other countries according to the needs of its peaceful economy be restricted. In its opinion on the US-circulated draft peace treaty with Japan on May 7 of this year, the Soviet government insisted that no restrictions should be placed on the development of Japan's peaceful economy, and all restrictions on Japan's trade with other countries should be lifted, based on the above principles.
    Does it need to be explained in detail that the unrestricted development of Japan's peaceful economy and Japan's foreign trade is not only conducive to maintaining peace in the Far East and establishing harmonious relations between Japan and other countries, especially its neighbors, but also beneficial to the Japanese people? This development of the Japanese economy will, for the first time, open up possibilities for the Japanese people to improve their welfare.
    Only those who attempt to stifle the Japanese economy and subordinate it to the interests of foreign monopoly capital will oppose including such provisions in the peace treaty with Japan. Only those people will oppose including such provisions in the peace treaty with Japan who intend to make the future development of the Japanese economy not for the peaceful needs of the Japanese people, not for promoting normal economic relations between Japan and other countries, but for the militarization of Japan, and to make its economy suitable for new war plans in the Far East plotted by certain major powers.
    A sound peaceful economy in Japan makes it possible and easy to meet the legitimate demands of some countries that have suffered from Japanese occupation for compensation for the damage caused by Japanese aggressors. For Japan, it is infinitely easier to do this than to directly use the labor of the Japanese people to compensate for these damages, as stipulated in the American-British draft. It is not difficult to understand the motives behind this draft's suggestion.
    The motive of this suggestion is that they hope to use the cheap labor of Japanese workers and farmers, completely disregarding that this method of compensating for damages—which is enslaving to Japan—will transfer a large part of Japan's productivity to other uses. This method is not beneficial to the countries that have legitimate reasons to demand compensation for damages from Japan, because these countries themselves have surplus labor, but only benefits certain major powers who want to profit from Japan's cheap labor.
    The peace treaty with Japan should of course properly resolve several territorial issues related to the reconciliation with Japan. In this regard, everyone knows that the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union also have clear obligations. These obligations have been listed in the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement.
    These agreements all acknowledge that China, now the People's Republic of China, has an absolutely indisputable right to those territories that remain separated from China to this day. China's territories for generations, such as the island of Taiwan (Formosa), the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and other territories that remain separated from China, should be returned to the People's Republic of China. This is indisputable.
    The Soviet Union's right to the southern part of Sakhalin Island and its adjacent islands and the Kuril Islands now under Soviet jurisdiction is equally indisputable.
    Therefore, if we proceed from the indisputable rights of various countries to the territories forcibly seized by Japan, there should be no ambiguity in resolving territorial issues when preparing the peace treaty with Japan.
    These are the main principles that should be adopted as the basis of the peace treaty with Japan in accordance with existing international agreements, and the realization of these principles would mean the realization of stable peace in the Far East.
    (2) The US-British draft is not a peace
        treaty but a treaty preparing for war
    The question is, to what extent does the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan conform to the principles put forward in the various agreements of the Allies regarding Japan, and therefore, to what extent does it conform to the interests of maintaining peace in the Far East?
    In this regard, we can first ask: does this draft contain any guarantees to prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor nation again? Unfortunately, the draft does not contain any guarantees on this point. It can be seen from the fact that the draft does not place any restrictions on the strength of the Japanese army that it does not contain any guarantees to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism. However, it is well known that the peace treaties concluded with other countries after World War II, especially the peace treaty with Italy, contain clear and explicit provisions limiting the strength of the armed forces of those countries. However, compared with other countries, Japan is in a privileged position in this regard, although this is without justification.
    Therefore, the US-British draft completely violates the principles that can serve as the basis for a genuine peace treaty with Japan, and such a genuine peace treaty can establish peace in the Far East and guarantee that Japanese aggression will not recur.
    This draft also violates the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, which, as early as 1947, put forward the task of "completing Japan's material and spiritual disarmament" in the aforementioned document "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan," "by methods including complete disarmament; reorganization of the economy to deprive Japan of its power to wage war; elimination of the forces of militarism; strict trial of war criminals, and provision for a strict period of control." This decision was passed by all member states of the Far Eastern Committee—Australia, Canada, China, France, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
    The drafters of the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan intend to minimize the importance of this fact, insisting that the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission are only valid during the period before the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. However, it does not take much effort to prove that this intention is completely untenable. The fact that the decision clearly mentioned measures that should "deprive Japan of its power to wage war" is sufficient to prove this. This single fact shows that the decision of the Far Eastern Commission naturally stipulated the entire post-war stage.
    The US-British draft peace treaty with Japan was drafted in accordance with the current practices of the US occupation authorities in Japan in restoring various militaristic institutions, establishing and expanding land, sea, and air force bases in Japan, restoring and expanding land, sea, and air forces and former Japanese armaments factories, and modernizing them. Japanese industry is gradually shifting to the production of munitions and strategic materials. Japan's material and human resources are being widely used by the United States to carry out its illegal military intervention in Korea under the banner of the United Nations.
    All of these measures taken by the US government in Japan, like the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan that we are now discussing, show that the US government disregards its obligations, jointly undertaken with other countries, to prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor nation again. The US government is counting on the revival of Japanese militarism, which can only arouse the strong opposition of those countries that are truly concerned about achieving genuine peace in the Far East.
    Therefore, the US-British draft does not include any guarantees to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and to ensure the security of countries that have suffered from militaristic Japanese aggression, although this should be one of the main tasks related to the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan.
    The US-British draft stipulates that Japan participate in the military groups that are being established under the auspices of the United States, and the purpose of these groups is absolutely not for the interests of maintaining peace in the Far East. It is well known what the purpose is of including clauses in the draft treaty that stipulate that Japan can conclude military agreements with other countries. The US government is attempting to predetermine the issue of concluding a US-Japan military agreement in the treaty, and thereby predetermine Japan's fate to become a US military base when concluding the peace treaty with Japan.
    The US government is using the conclusion of a US-Japan military agreement to replace the task of preventing the revival of Japanese militarism and ensuring the future security of countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression. It is not difficult to understand that the conclusion of such an agreement will further drive Japan towards the revival of militarism, and will give greater encouragement to the activities of Japanese militarist groups, which, disregarding the national interests of the Japanese people, are preparing to launch new military adventures against neighboring countries.
    The US-British draft peace treaty with Japan stipulates that Japan has the obligation to join military groups used to deal with Japan's neighbors—mainly the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The military agreement stipulated in the US-British peace treaty excludes countries such as the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, which is sufficient evidence.
    Any false rhetoric about Japan's right to "individual or collective self-defense" cannot conceal the true nature of this demand, because Japan has not been threatened by any neighboring country. The purpose of this demand is to have Japan bear the obligation of participating in a military group led by the United States now, and to tightly bind Japan. In this situation, any claim that Japan must join any military group for the sake of so-called self-defense is completely unfounded. Everyone knows that Japan has never been attacked by any country for centuries, so the argument that Japan must conclude military agreements and military alliances with other countries for the sake of Japan's self-defense is even more absurd.
    The presentation of these arguments is obviously intended to confuse public opinion, so that public opinion cannot see the true purpose of the drafters of the US-British treaty in dragging Japan into their aggressive military group, because these purposes are absolutely not for maintaining peace in the Far East.
    The US-British draft peace treaty with Japan stipulates that Japan join a military group, which is bound to arouse the concerns of those countries that truly care about preserving and maintaining peace in the Far East.
    Speaking of this, it is also necessary to talk about the withdrawal of occupation forces from Japanese territory and the issue that foreign countries must not establish military bases on Japanese territory.
    Everyone knows that the peace treaties concluded after World War II—including the peace treaty with Italy—have clear clauses stipulating that the occupation must end as soon as possible, and in any case no later than ninety days after the treaty comes into effect. The US-British peace treaty (Article 6) formally contains such a provision. However, at the same time, this article also mentions that foreign armed forces may remain on Japanese territory "in accordance with or as a result of bilateral or multilateral agreements already concluded or to be concluded by one or more of the Allied Powers with Japan."
    It is obvious that the reserved clause for withdrawing occupation troops within ninety days is empty and meaningless rhetoric, the purpose of which is obviously to confuse naive people so that they cannot see the true meaning of this article in the peace treaty. The true meaning of this article is that Japan has been forced to accept some decisions, according to which Japan has guaranteed in advance to provide its territory so that the United States can establish bases for the US Navy, Army, and Air Force in accordance with its aggressive plans in the Far East.
    Who does not know that the US government and the current Japanese government have held lengthy negotiations to discuss the continued stationing of US occupation forces in Japanese territory and the issue of US military bases in Japan after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan? Who does not know that in the course of these negotiations, the Japanese government has been under heavy pressure from the United States, which currently actually controls Japan's political and economic life?
    As for the clauses on territorial issues in the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan, the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to declare that this draft completely undermines China's indisputable right to recover its inseparable territories—Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and other territories ceded from China as a result of Japanese aggression. The draft treaty only mentions Japan's renunciation of its rights to these territories, but deliberately makes no mention of the future of these territories. In fact, Taiwan and the aforementioned islands have been seized by the United States, and the United States wants to legalize these acts of aggression in the draft treaty we are currently discussing here. However, the fate of these territories should be very clear, they must be returned to the Chinese people—the original owners of these territories.
    In the same way, this draft treaty attempts to rudely undermine the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the southern part of Sakhalin Island and its adjacent islands and the Kuril Islands, which are already under its jurisdiction, merely mentioning Japan's renunciation of its rights, legal basis, and claims to these territories, and completely failing to mention the historical ownership of these territories and Japan's undeniable obligation to recognize the Soviet Union's sovereignty over this part of its territory. Let us not even mention the fact that the United States and Britain, which signed the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement, are making such proposals on territorial issues, which is an act of blatant violation of their obligations under these international agreements.
    The US-British draft stipulates the cancellation of Japan's sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, Nishinoshima, the Volcano Islands, Okino-tori Island, Minami-tori Island, and the Daito Islands, and handing these islands over to the United States for administration in the name of the United Nations trusteeship. But everyone clearly knows that this provision to separate the aforementioned islands from Japan is not found in the aforementioned international agreements and the decisions of the Security Council, and only the Security Council has the right to make decisions on establishing trusteeships over certain territories of strategic importance. This means that this demand in the US-British draft is arbitrary and illegal.
    We cannot find any clauses related to the democratic transformation of Japan in the US-British draft. In this regard, this draft also cannot meet the requirements that should be made of the peace treaty with Japan. Despite the fact that the Potsdam Proclamation clearly pointed out the necessity of the democratic transformation of Japan, the fact is that this is not the case. We have already said that the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission also mentioned that the Japanese people must be encouraged to establish "democratic and representative institutions" and to respect basic human rights. The current situation in Japan in this regard can be seen from the fact that during the entire occupation period, with the consent and direct encouragement of the US occupation authorities, various oppressions have been carried out against Japanese trade unions, Japanese democratic parties, prominent democratic leaders, and progressive Japanese newspapers.
    This draft also makes no mention of the prohibition of the establishment of various militaristic organizations, fascist organizations, and other similar organizations in Japan. The danger of the revival of these organizations has become increasingly real, because many such organizations are already operating openly. Despite the fact that the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission clearly state: "Strictly prohibit all systems that manifest militarism and the spirit of aggression," the fact is that this is not the case.
    All of this prompts us to seriously consider the question: What is the purpose of the drafters of the US-British treaty? What path do they hope to push Japan onto?
    A careful analysis of the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan makes it very clear that the purpose of this draft is not only to restore Japanese militarism, which makes the danger of the recurrence of Japanese aggression a reality, but also to place Japan in the hands of militarists and reactionaries who once caused Japan to suffer a national disaster.
    Finally, serious attention should be paid to the clauses on economic issues in the US-British draft. Regarding these issues, the draft is mainly concerned with consolidating the economic privileges that certain countries—mainly the United States—have obtained in Japan after the end of the war and during the occupation period.
    The draft contains detailed clauses to maintain the dominant position of foreign monopoly capital in the Japanese economy. This involves Japanese industry, Japanese shipping, Japanese foreign trade, and guarantees various rights and demands of foreign companies and legal persons in Japan, etc. At the same time, the draft peace treaty makes no mention of the need to ensure the unimpeded development of Japan's peaceful industry, foreign trade, maritime transport, and commercial shipbuilding. This cannot be said to be accidental. It is an open secret who hopes to shackle Japanese industry and flood the Japanese market with goods manufactured abroad.
    The draft makes no mention whatsoever of Japan having the right to obtain raw material resources with other countries on an equal footing. It is futile to look for such words in this draft, although the Potsdam Proclamation stipulates this. The reason why this clause is not in the draft is that it is not conducive to the United States and Britain, who are attempting to get involved in all the world's major raw material resources.
    Therefore, the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan submitted to this conference cannot promote reconciliation with Japan at all, nor can it prevent the recurrence of Japanese aggression in the future.
    The US-British peace treaty cannot and will not satisfy any country that advocates establishing a stable peace and eliminating the danger of another war, not only in words but also in deeds. This kind of draft is particularly unable to satisfy the countries of Asia and the Far East, whose people have suffered more deeply from Japanese aggression than any other country, and they cannot tolerate the revival of Japanese militarism, because Japanese militarism is constantly threatening the peaceful survival of its Far Eastern neighbors. This is why the US-British draft has been rejected by many countries—the People's Republic of China, India, Burma, and some other countries.
    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China made a fair assessment of the US-British treaty in its statement on August 15, saying, "In reality, this is a treaty that prepares for a new war, not a genuine peace treaty," and that the US-British treaty is "a threat to the Asian people, undermines world peace and security, and is not conducive to the Japanese people."
    Everyone also knows that the Indian government has severely condemned the US-British draft treaty. The Indian government said that it cannot participate in this treaty, because the "solution" stipulated by the treaty can only cause dissatisfaction among the broad strata of the Japanese people, and is bound to sow the seeds of future disputes and possible conflicts in the Far East.
    In summary, regarding the US-British draft treaty, we can draw the following conclusions:
    1. There are no guarantees in the draft to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism and prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor country again. There are no guarantees in the draft to ensure the safety of countries that have suffered from militaristic Japanese aggression. The draft creates conditions for the revival of Japanese militarism and the danger of the recurrence of Japanese aggression.
    2. The draft treaty does not actually stipulate the withdrawal of foreign occupation troops. On the contrary, the draft agrees that foreign troops will remain stationed in Japanese territory after the signing of the treaty, and foreign military bases will be maintained in Japan.
    The draft stipulates that Japan may participate in the aggressive military alliance concluded with the United States under the pretext of Japan's self-defense.
    3. The draft treaty not only does not stipulate that Japan recognizes that it must not participate in any alliance against any country that participated in the war against militaristic Japan with troops, but even clears the way for Japan to participate in the aggressive groups being established in the Far East under the protection of the United States.
    4. The draft treaty does not stipulate the democratization of Japan and the protection of the democratic rights of the Japanese people. This fact poses a direct threat that the pre-war fascist order will be revived in Japan.
    5. The draft treaty blatantly infringes on the legitimate rights of the Chinese people to the inseparable parts of Chinese territory—Taiwan (Formosa), the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and other territories ceded from China as a result of Japanese aggression.
    6. The draft treaty violates the obligations undertaken by the United States and Britain under the Yalta Agreement to return the southern part of Sakhalin Island to the Soviet Union and to hand over the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union.
    7. There are many economic clauses whose purpose is to guarantee the privileges obtained by foreign monopoly enterprises, mainly US monopoly enterprises, during the occupation period. The Japanese economy is placed in a slave position dependent on these foreign monopoly enterprises.
    8. The draft actually ignores the legitimate demands of countries that have suffered from Japanese occupation to demand compensation for the damages Japan has inflicted on them. At the same time, because the draft stipulates that damages will be compensated directly by the labor of the Japanese people, it forces Japan to accept a form of enslaving compensation.
    9. The US-British draft is not a peace treaty, but a treaty to prepare for another war in the Far East.
    (3) The Procedure for Preparing
        a Peace Treaty with Japan
    Why does the US-British draft treaty not only lack any guarantee of preventing the resurgence of Japanese militarism, but, on the contrary, create conditions for Japan to become an aggressor nation again? This is not difficult to explain. Because in fact, the Japan plan of the drafters of the US-British treaty is completely unrelated to the task of preventing the resurgence of Japanese militarism and ensuring the peace and security of the countries that have suffered Japanese aggression. Those countries that have suffered the most from Japanese aggression and are therefore most concerned about preventing the recurrence of Japanese aggression have been excluded from the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. Moreover, the procedure for preparing the peace treaty is stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement and the famous United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942. The Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the five countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, China, Britain, and France should establish a Council of Foreign Ministers, and the United Nations Declaration stipulates that separate peace treaties must not be concluded with countries that have fought against the Allied countries and their associates. The Potsdam Agreement clearly pointed out that the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers was mainly for "the preparatory work of the peace treaties," and when signing a certain peace treaty, "the conference will be composed of member states that signed the surrender instrument of the enemy country."
    Therefore, regarding the procedure for preparing the peace treaty with Japan, there is nothing unclear. Any country that abides by the obligations of international agreements not only in words but also in fact should strictly abide by the procedure for preparing the peace treaty in accordance with the provisions of these agreements. It is unreasonable for the United States and the British government to monopolize the preparation of the treaty and now force other countries to sign the separate peace treaty with Japan that they have prepared.
    It should be mentioned here that in the past, when preparing the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland, this procedure was followed. We can see that experience proves that the demands of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are correct, and their governments have repeatedly stated their opinions on this issue, believing that the procedure for preparing the peace treaty must be strictly followed, and that the Council of Foreign Ministers must be responsible for carrying out the work of preparing the treaty.
    As with the conclusion of peace treaties with other countries, the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan must, of course, have the participation of all other countries that have fought against Japan. As early as 1947, the Soviet Union made such a proposal in the note to the then-Chinese government on December 30, 1947, and in the note to the British government on January 4, 1948.
    Everyone knows that the US government has taken the initiative in preparing the peace treaty with Japan into its own hands, violating its own obligations and strongly opposing the transfer of the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan to the Council of Foreign Ministers. To justify this attitude, it offered a reason, insisting that this procedure would delay the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. The fact is that the reason why the peace treaties with the aforementioned five countries could be signed as early as four years ago was precisely because the preparation of these treaties was done by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Merely saying this is enough to see how untenable that claim is.
    The United States and the British government jointly proposed the draft treaty, and they are taking another approach, illegally completely excluding the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China from the preparation of the treaty, and it is fundamentally impossible to achieve reconciliation with Japan without the participation of these two countries. The Soviet government has reminded the US government of these facts in its opinion on the US draft peace treaty with Japan on May 7 and in its note on June 10. The Chinese people were forced to wage a difficult war for many years against militaristic Japan that invaded their territory, and suffered extraordinarily great sacrifices in this struggle. It is precisely for this reason that the government of the People's Republic of China, as the only legal authority expressing the will of the Chinese people, cannot be excluded<ctrl100> from the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet government fully agrees with the opinions expressed by the government of the People's Republic of China on this issue in its corresponding statements, especially in its statements on May 22 and August 15 of this year, and insists that the People's Republic of China fully participate in the preparation and discussion of the peace treaty with Japan. As for those countries that follow the United States and Britain in preparing to sign the treaty without the participation of the People's

    葛罗米柯九月五日在旧金山会议上演说全文
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社旧金山七日讯：葛罗米柯于一九五一年九月五日在旧金山会议上发表演说，全文如下：主席先生，诸位代表先生：
    苏联代表团从一开始就认为有必要强调对日和约问题的重要性。派有代表出席这个会议的许多国家都曾经遭受过日本的侵略。中华人民共和国是更不用说了，它的人民曾长期和侵犯他们的领土的日本侵略者单独作战，甚至从这个事实就可以明显看出这个问题的重要性。
    早在一九三一年，日本军队就侵略满洲了。
    军国主义的日本在占领满洲六年、把满洲变成在亚洲大陆上扩大侵略的跳板以后，就在一九三七年侵略中国中部，占领了中国的生命攸关的中心地区。中国人民在反抗日本侵略的斗争中，不论在人力方面和物力方面都遭受了巨大的损失。
    中国人民在反抗日本侵略的斗争中，保卫自己的独立，肩负起反抗这种侵略的斗争的主要负担，他们对反对日本军国主义者的斗争作了无可估计的贡献，从而加速了爱好自由的人民的最后胜利。
    大家知道得很清楚，在十三年以前，军国主义的日本就在海参崴地区哈桑湖畔进攻苏联。虽然日本军国主义者受到应得的挫败，但他们并没有放弃他们侵略苏联的阴谋。在一九三九年，日本侵略军又在别的地方——蒙古人民共和国哈尔新河附近地区重新发动进攻，意图冲向苏联领土。虽然日本军国主义者这一次又从苏联军队方面得到应得的挫败，大家都知道，他们仍然没有放弃他们侵略苏联的阴谋，而且毫不掩饰他们的目标是攫取苏维埃远东。
    亚洲和远东的其他若干国家，包括印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和菲律宾在内，也曾遭受日本侵略。
    最后，美国人民也熟知日本的侵略，因为日本对珍珠港——美国在太平洋上的海军基地——的进攻，在他们是记忆犹新的。这一对美国的进攻，扩大了日本侵略的规模。在这以后，日本军国主义者就进攻亚洲和远东的其他若干国家。战争扩大了，囊括了整个亚洲。将近十五年，日本军国主义一个接着一个地进攻亚洲和远东的国家。这些国家曾有必要齐心协力来维护遭受日本侵略者进攻的国家的独立，并为建立远东的持久和平创造条件。亚洲和远东的许多国家为了反抗日本军国主义者、保卫它们的民族独立，曾遭受重大损失。
    所有这一切都表明：现在正是利用因击溃日本侵略者而造成的条件的良好时机，也是建立远东和平的良好时机。正是由于这种考虑，苏联才一再提出建议，主张采取具体步骤，确保这个问题得到解决。几年来，苏联一直在建议迅速缔结对日和约。当然，苏联一向是、现在也是从下述前提出发的：它应当是符合各国人民利益的民主的和平，而不是只对某些贪得无餍的帝国主义者集团有利的帝国主义的和平。它必须是真正符合于爱好和平的各国、首先是那些遭受日本侵略的各国的正当要求的和平，必须是防止日本卷土重来成为一个侵略国家的和平。
    由此可见，问题应该是要有不会让日本军国主义重新抬头，而可以保证亚洲和远东各国和平与安全的这样一种和约与这样一种媾和。
    不仅遭受日本侵略的各国关心这一点，而且日本人民也是如此。日本人民曾被军国主义分子卷入了侵略其他国家和人民的战争中，现在正在为军国主义分子所犯的罪行付出代价。日本人民的民族利益要求日本与其他各国之间，首先是与它的邻国之间应该有和平的关系。
    苏联代表团认为有必要强调对日和约问题的重要性，因为派有代表出席这次会议的国家，绝不是个个都表现关心如何防止会使日本军国主义者再次把日本推上侵略道路的情势。而且，提交这次会议的美英对日和约草案表明了：这个和约草案的制订者，对于为日本军国主义的复活廓清道路，把日本推上侵略和军事冒险的途径，倒是更要关心些。
    这主要是指美国，它的对日政策近几年来充分地证明了美国政府对日本有它特别的用心，而这种用心是和真正的对日媾和的利益、和保持与巩固远东和平的利益完全背道而驰的。
    （一）关于对日和约所应依据
            的原则
    在考虑对日和约的时候，首先出现的一个问题就是这个条约所应依据的原则是什么？如何确保日本不再变为侵略国家？军国主义者已在日本抬头，并在明目张胆地谈论他们的复仇计划。怎样才能确保日本的命运不致再落入这些军国主义者之手？如果出席这次会议的代表们恪守那些关于日本的著名国际协定中所表达的原则——这些原则如能实施，就可以确实防止日本军国主义的复活——那末，这个任务就可以胜利地完成。这主要是指一九四三年的开罗宣言、一九四五年的波茨坦公告和一九四五年的雅尔塔协定等项协定。根据这些协定，美国、英国、中国和苏联在结束对日战争、对日媾和以及把日本变为爱好和平的民主国家方面，承担了明确的义务。
    这也是指一九四二年一月一日的联合国宣言等项协定，根据这些协定，联合国保证不和敌国（包括日本在内）单独媾和；以及由苏联、英国、美国、中国、法国、荷兰、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、印度、菲律宾组成的远东委员会，在对日战争结束后所通过的关于对日基本政策的各项决定。
    大家知道，一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦公告以及远东委员会根据这项公告所通过的对日基本政策的决定，都规定消灭日本军国主义，并规定防止使日本军国主义有可能复活之情况发生。一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会关于“对投降后日本之基本政策”的决定，特别规定在日本军队方面对日本施行严格的限制。波茨坦公告指明：欺骗及错误领导日本人民，使其“妄欲征服世界”者之威权及势力，必须消除。波茨坦公告又指出：必须采取措施，防止日本重新武装而采取侵略的方针。
    各国间关于日本的协定规定肃清日本的军国主义，并规定把日本改变成能够与其他国家和人民，包括受日本侵略的苦难特别深重的邻国，保持正常关系的爱好和平的国家。那些真正愿意防止日本侵略重演并确保日本与其他国家间的和平关系的人，是不会不切望达到这个目的的。
    这样，肃清日本军国主义的问题，就是必须由对日和约予以解决的基本问题之一。这首先就是说，对日和约中必须包括限制日本军队——陆军、海军和空军——兵力的规定。
    大家知道，当日本军国主义者准备侵略其他国家的时候，他们建立了庞大的军队——陆海空军。在日本袭击珍珠港的前夕，日本陆军有三百二十万人。在一九四五年八月日本投降时，日本陆军约有六百万人。单单驻在日本军国主义者占领下的满洲领土上的日本陆军精锐——所谓关东军，数目几近一百万人。
    自然，所有这一切过度膨胀的日本军队都是靠掠夺劳动人民来维持的。日本军国主义者追随他们的侵略伙伴希特勒德国之后，开始把许多国家的整个国家与人民变成他们的奴隶。他们很少关心日本人民的切身利益，对日本农民与工人不断地加紧捐税的压榨，以便榨取尽可能多的款项来供准备战争和后来进行战争之用。
    因此，在准备和缔结对日和约时，必须解决防止日本军国主义复活的保证问题，消除日本侵略重演的可能性的保证问题。
    毋庸赘言，在缔结和约后，一切占领军必须撤出日本，绝不许在它的领土上保有外国军事基地。
    和约中对于这一点如果没有清晰的和明确的规定，必将违背应使日本恢复主权的对日媾和的目的，同样也违背保持远东和平的利益。
    上述的各国协定规定把日本改造为民主的国家。
    波茨坦公告直接了当地指出：“日本政府必须将阻止日本人民民主趋势之复兴及增强之所有障碍予以消除”。它还规定确立言论、宗教、思想的自由以及对基本人权之尊重。远东委员会的“对投降后日本之基本政策”的决定宣称：将鼓励日本人民发展个人自由与对基本人权，特别是宗教、集会、结社自由、言论与新闻自由的尊重的倾向；并且将鼓励他们组织民主的与代表民意的机构。
    这便是各国在对日作战时即已提出的第二个最重要的问题，日本民主改造问题。提出这个问题是完全可以理解的。军国主义的日本是反动集团统治的。整个政治与社会生活都处在这个集团以及支持它的日本大公司——三菱、三井及其他公司——的控制之下。
    由此可知，肃清日本军国主义和防止日本军国主义复活的问题是与日本政治社会生活的民主改造的问题，和在日本建立民主秩序，使日本的命运不由少数反动军国主义分子的暴政所决定的问题，不可分地联系着的。
    这意味着对日和约必须包含一些条款来保证实现关于必须恢复及加强日本人民民主倾向、必须依照波茨坦公告及各国其他决议之规定民主改造日本的原则。
    准备对日和约方面的非常重要的问题是关于发展日本经济的问题。大家知道，日本的经济在过去是为军国主义集团服务的。它的发展方向是使日本的工业和农业准备应付战争的需要。
    战前及战时日本经济的特点是它的军事化，这损害了日本人民的切身利益。工业和农业的基本资源被用来生产武器及战略物资，而不是用来满足平民的需要。
    这意味着对日和约应该包含一些这样的条款，这些条款和对日本武装部队的限制同时实施，就可以防止日本经济军事化。同时，和约对日本和平经济的发展不应加以任何阻碍。这项原则在波茨坦公告中已有明文规定。如所周知，美、英、中、苏四国都在波茨坦公告上签了字。
    苏联政府已本着波茨坦公告中的这项原则，在一九四八年九月向远东委员会提出建议，建议一方面禁止恢复和创立日本战争工业并建立相应的管制以实施这个禁令；另一方面又不应限制以满足日本人民需要为目的的日本和平工业的恢复和发展，也不应限制日本按照其和平经济的需要而发展与其他国家间的贸易。苏联政府在本年五月七日关于美国先前散发的对日和约草案的意见书中，即本着上述原则而坚持对于日本和平经济的发展不应加以任何限制，对于日本与其他国家贸易的限制应全部取消。
    日本的和平经济和日本的对外贸易的无限制发展，不但有利于维持远东和平和建立日本与其他国家特别是与其邻国的和睦关系，而且有利于日本人民，这一点还用得着详细解释吗？日本经济的这种发展将第一次为日本人民开辟增进他们福利的可能性。
    唯有那些企图扼杀日本经济而使日本经济从属于外国垄断资本利益的人，才会反对把这样一些条款列入对日和约。唯有那些人才会反对把这样一些条款列入对日和约，他们打算使日本经济的未来发展不是为了满足日本人民的和平需要，不是为了促进日本与其他国家间的正常经济关系，而是为了日本的军国主义化，为了使它的经济适合于某些大国所图谋的远东新战争计划。
    日本有健全的和平经济，就有可能容易来满足若干曾受日本占领之害的国家关于要求赔偿日本侵略者所造成的破坏这种正当要求。对于日本来说，这样做，比依照美英草案所规定的直接利用日本人民的劳动来抵偿这些损害，要无比地容易得多。不难明白，这个草案的建议的动机何在。
    这个建议的动机是：他们希望利用日本工农的廉价劳动，完全不计及这种赔偿损害的方式——对日本来说是奴役性的——将使日本生产力的一大部分转移到别的用途。这种办法，并不利于有正当理由向日本要求赔偿损害的国家，因为这些国家自身都有多余的劳动力，而只是有利于某些大国，它们想要利用日本的廉价劳动牟利。
    对日和约当然要解决好些与对日媾和有关的领土问题。在这方面，大家都知道，美国、英国、中国和苏联也是负有明确的义务的。这些义务都已列举在开罗宣言、波茨坦公告以及雅尔塔协定中了。
    这些协议中都承认中国，现在是中华人民共和国，对那些直至今日仍然被和中国割开的领土，有着绝对无可争辩的权利。中国多少世代来的领土，如台湾岛（福摩萨）、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛及其他仍被和中国割开的领土，应该归还中华人民共和国，这是无可争辩的。
    苏联对于库页岛南部及其邻近各岛屿和现在在苏联管辖下的千岛群岛的权利同样是无可置辩的。
    因此，如果我们从各国对于被日本用武力夺去的领土享有无可争辩的权利出发，在准备对日和约时，对于解决领土问题方面应该没有不清楚之点。
    这就是依照现存的各国际协定应该采纳作为对日和约之基础的主要原则，这些原则的实现就意味着远东稳定和平的实现。
    （二）美英草案不是和约而是
            准备战争的条约
    问题在于美英对日和约草案究竟有几分符合同盟国关于日本的各项协定中所提出的原则，因而，又有几分符合维持远东和平的利益。
    在这一方面，我们首先可以问：这个草案对于防止日本重新成为侵略国家是否包含有任何保证？不幸的是草案在这一点上并没有任何保证。只须从草案对日本军队的兵力并没有加以任何限制这个事实来看，就可以看出它对于防止日本军国主义的再起并没有包含任何保证。然而，这是大家都知道的：在第二次世界大战后和其他国家缔结的和约，特别是对意大利和约，都包含有限制各该国军队兵力的清楚明确的规定。但是，和其他国家比较起来，日本在这一方面处于特权地位，虽然这是毫无理由的。
    因此，美英草案完全违背了可以作为真正的对日和约的基础的诸项原则，而这种真正的对日和约才能建立远东和平和保证日本侵略不会再起。
    这项草案同样也违反远东委员会的决定，远东委员会远在一九四七年就在前述“对投降后日本之基本政策”的文件上，提出了“完成日本物质及精神上解除武装”的任务，“其方法包括全部解除军备；改组经济，以剥夺日本作战之力量；消灭军国主义之势力；严厉审判战犯，并规定一严格管制之时期”。这项决定是由远东委员会全体会员国——澳大利亚、加拿大、中国、法国、印度、荷兰、新西兰、菲律宾、苏联、英国和美国——所通过的。
    美英对日和约草案的拟订者打算缩小这一事实的重要性，硬说远东委员会的决定只在对日和约缔结以前这一段期间有效。可是，不用费多少力气就可以证明，这种打算是完全站不住的。那项决定是明白提到了应该“剥夺日本作战之力量”的措施的，这一点就足可证明。仅仅这一件事实就表明远东委员会的决定是自然把整个战后阶段都规定在内的。
    美英对日和约草案是按照美国驻日占领当局目前恢复各种军国主义机构、建立并扩充在日本的陆海空军基地、恢复和扩充陆海空军和以前的日本兵工厂并使之现代化等方面的实际作法拟订的。日本工业已经在逐渐转营军火和战略物资的生产。日本的物质和人力资源正在广泛地被美国利用去遂行美国在联合国的旗帜下非法进行的在朝鲜的军事干涉。
    美国政府在日本所采取的所有这些措施，正和我们现在正在讨论的美英对日和约草案一样，都表明美国政府把它与其他国家共同承担的防止日本重新成为侵略国家的义务置之不顾。美国政府正在指望着日本军国主义的复活，而这是只能引起那些真正关心获致远东真正和平的国家的强烈反对的。
    因此，美英草案并不包括防止日本军国主义复活、保障曾经遭受军国主义日本侵略的国家的安全的任何保证，虽然这应该是与准备对日和约有关的主要任务之一。
    美英草案规定日本参加正在美国卵翼下建立起来的军事集团，这些集团的目的绝对不是为了维持远东和平的利益。把规定日本可以与其他国家缔结军事协定的条款列入和约草案的目的何在，是众所周知的。美国政府企图在和约中预先决定美日缔结军事协定的问题，并从而在缔结对日和约的时候即已预先决定日本的命运是要成为美国军事基地。
    美国政府用缔结美日军事协定来代替防止日本军国主义复活并保证曾经遭受日本侵略的国家的未来安全的任务。不难了解，缔结这种协定将更进一步地驱使日本走向军国主义的复活，并将予日本军国主义集团的活动以更大鼓励，这些军国主义集团不顾日本人民的民族利益，准备对邻国发动新的军事冒险。
    美英对日和约草案规定日本有义务加入用来对付日本邻国——主要是苏联和中华人民共和国——的军事集团。美英和约草案中规定的军事协定把中华人民共和国和苏联这些国家排斥在外，就是充分的证据。
    任何关于日本有权进行“单独或集体自卫”的虚伪辞句都掩饰不了这个要求的真正性质，因为日本没有受到邻国的任何威胁。这个要求的目的是要在目前就让日本承担参加以美国为首的军事集团的义务，而把日本紧紧地束缚起来。在这种情况下，凡是关于日本为了所谓的自卫目的必须加入任何军事集团的说法都是完全没有根据的。大家知道，日本在几世纪当中从未受到任何国家的进攻，因此藉口为了日本自卫的利益，说日本必须与其他国家缔结军事协定和军事联盟的论点就格外荒谬。
    这些论点的提出显然是为了迷惑舆论，使舆论看不清美英和约草案的拟订者想把日本拖入他们侵略性军事集团的真正目的，因为这些目的绝对不是为了维持远东和平。
    美英和约草案中规定日本加入军事集团，这势必引起那些真正关怀保存并维持远东和平的国家的忧虑。
    谈到这一点，也必须谈谈占领军撤出日本领土以及外国不得在日本领土上建立军事基地的问题。
    大家知道，第二次世界大战后缔结的和约——包括对意大利和约在内——都有明确的条款，规定占领必须尽早结束，无论如何不得迟于和约生效后的九十日之内。美英和约草案（第六条）正式载有这样的规定。但是，在这一条又同时谈到外国武装部队可能“依照或由于一个或一个以上的盟国与日本业已缔结或将缔结之双边或多边协定”在日本领土上留驻。
    很明显，九十天内撤退占领军队的保留条款，是空洞的和没有意义的辞令，其目的显然是想迷惑天真的人们，使他们看不出和约草案这一条的真正意义。这一条的真正意义是：日本已经被迫接受了一些决定，根据这些决定，日本事先就保证提供它的领土，让美国按照在远东的侵略计划，建立美国海陆空军的基地。
    谁不晓得美国政府与目前的日本政府曾举行历时很久的谈判，讨论在对日和约签订后，美国占领军继续驻在日本领土以及美国在日本的军事基地的问题呢？谁不知道在这些谈判的进程中，日本政府受到目前实际上控制了日本的政治经济生活的美国的沉重压力呢？
    至于美英对日和约草案关于领土问题的条款，苏联代表团认为有必要声明：这个草案完全破坏了中国收回它的不可分割的领土——台湾、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛以及其他岛屿——的无可争辩的权利，这些岛屿是日本军国主义者从中国割去的。和约草案只提到日本放弃这些领土的权利，但故意丝毫不提这些领土的前途。事实上，台湾以及上述的岛屿已被美国夺去，美国想在我们目前这里讨论的和约草案中，使这些侵略行动合法化。可是，这些领土的命运应该是十分清楚的，它们必须归还中国人民——这些领土的原有的主人。
    以同样的方式，这个和约草案企图粗暴地破坏苏联对已在其管辖下的库页岛南部和附近岛屿以及千岛群岛的主权，仅仅提到日本放弃对这些领土的权利、权利根据与要求，完全不提这些领土的历史上的所有权以及日本有不容置辩的义务承认苏联对自己这一部分领土的主权。曾经在开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和雅尔塔协定上签字的美国和英国关于领土问题提出这样的建议，也就是公然破坏它们根据这些国际协定承担的义务的行为，这一点我们姑且不去说它。
    美英草案规定取消日本对琉球群岛、小笠原群岛、西之岛、火山群岛、冲之鸟岛、南鸟岛和大东群岛的主权，并在联合国托管这些岛屿的名义下，把这些岛屿交给美国管理。但是大家清楚地知道，这种使上述岛屿脱离日本的规定，并未见于上述国际协定和安全理事会的决定中，而只有安全理事会才有权作出关于对某些具有战略重要性的领土建立托管的决定。这就是说美英草案中的这种要求是武断的，不合法的。
    我们在美英草案中无法找到任何有关日本民主改造的条款。在这方面，这个草案也不能满足应当向对日和约提出的要求。尽管波茨坦公告明白指出日本民主改造的必要性，事实却是如此。我们已经说过，远东委员会的决定也说到必须鼓励日本人民建立“民主与代表民意之机构”及尊重基本人权。目前日本这方面的情况，仅仅从在整个占领期间，在美国占领当局的同意和直接鼓励下，对日本工会、日本民主党派和著名民主领袖以及日本的进步报纸施行了种种压迫这一件事实，就看得出来。
    这个草案也完全没有提到不准在日本成立各种军国主义组织、法西斯组织以及其他类似的组织。这些组织复活的危险已越来越现实，因为许多这种组织已在公开活动了。尽管远东委员会的决定明白说：“严格取缔一切表现军国主义与侵略精神之制度”，而事实却是如此。
    这一切都促使我们郑重考虑这样的问题：美英和约草案的拟订者的目的何在？他们希望把日本推上什么道路？
    把美英对日和约草案加以仔细的分析，便可以十分清楚地看出：这个草案的目的不但是要恢复使日本侵略重演之危险成为现实的日本军国主义，并且还要把日本置于曾经一度使日本遭到民族浩劫的军国主义者与反动分子的掌握中。
    最后，应该严重地注意美英草案中关于经济问题的条款。对于这些问题，草案主要关心的是巩固某些国家——主要是美国——在战争结束后以及占领时期在日本取得的经济特权。
    草案中有详尽的条款使外国垄断资本在日本经济中保持主宰地位。这牵涉到日本的工业、日本的航业、日本的对外贸易，牵涉到保障外国公司与法人对日本的各种各样的权利与要求等等。同时，和约草案一点也没有提到需要确保日本的和平工业、对外贸易、海上航运、商船建造的不受阻碍的发展。这也不能说成是偶然的事。谁希望箝制日本工业而以外国制造的货物充斥日本市场，这已是个公开的秘密了。
    这个草案丝毫没有提到日本应有与其他国家在平等地位上取得原料资源。我们要在这草案上去找这种话是徒劳的，虽然波茨坦公告规定了这一点。草案中没有这个条款，原因是这不利于企图染指世界上一切主要的原料资源的美国和英国。
    因此，提交这个会议的美英对日和约草案一点不能促进对日媾和，也一点不能防止将来日本侵略的重演。
    美英和约草案没有而且也不可能满足不但在言论上并且在行动上主张建立稳固的和平与消除另一次战争危险的任何国家。这种草案特别不能满足亚洲和远东的国家，这些国家的人民所受到的日本侵略的痛苦比任何其他国家都更深，他们不能容忍日本军国主义复活，因为日本军国主义经常都在威胁其远东邻国和平生存。这便是美英草案被许多国家——中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸以及其他一些国家——拒绝的缘故。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府在其八月十五日的声明中，对美英和约草案作了一个公正的估价，它说：“实际上这是一个准备新的战争的条约，并非真正的和平条约”，并且美英和约草案是“威胁亚洲人民，破坏世界和平安全，并不利于日本人民的”。
    大家也同样知道，印度政府曾痛斥美英和约草案。印度政府说：它不能参加这个和约，因为和约所规定的“解决办法”只能在日本人民广大阶层中造成不满，并且一定播下远东未来纠纷与可能的冲突的种子。
    总起来说，关于美英和约草案，我们可以得出如下的结论：
    一、草案中没有任何防止日本军国主义再起、防止日本变为侵略国的保证。草案中没有任何保障曾遭军国主义日本侵略的各国的安全的保证。草案为日本军国主义的复活及日本侵略重演的危险创造条件。
    二、和约草案实际并未规定撤退外国占领军。相反地，草案同意在和约签字后外国军队仍留驻日本领土，并在日本保持外国的军事基地。
    草案以日本的自卫为藉口，规定日本得参加与美国缔结的侵略性军事联盟。
    三、和约草案不但未规定日本承认不得参加任何反对曾对军国主义日本作战的任何国家的联盟，反而甚至为日本参加在美国庇护下正在远东建立的侵略集团扫清道路。
    四、和约草案并未规定使日本民主化及保障日本人民民主权利。这个事实造成一个直接的威胁，即战前的法西斯秩序将在日本复活。
    五、和约草案公然侵犯中国人民对中国领土的不可分割的部分——台湾（福摩萨）、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛以及由于日本侵略的结果而自中国割去的其他领土的合法权利。
    六、和约草案违反美国和英国根据雅尔塔协定所承担的关于把库页岛南部归还苏联及把千岛群岛交予苏联的义务。
    七、有许多经济条款其目的都是保障外国垄断企业，主要是美国的垄断企业，在占领时期所获得的特权。日本经济被置于仰赖这些外国垄断企业的奴隶地位。
    八、草案实际忽视了曾遭受日本占领的国家关于要求赔偿日本所给予它们的损害的正当要求。同时，由于草案规定损害将直接由日本人民的劳动来赔偿，因此强使日本接受一种奴役的赔偿方式。
    九、美英草案不是和约，而是准备远东另一次战争的条约。
    （三）准备对日和约的程序
    为什么美英对日和约草案不仅毫无防止日本军国主义再起的保证，而且相反，为日本再度变成侵略国家创造条件呢？这并不难解释。因为事实上美英和约草案起草者的对日计划是与防止日本军国主义再起以及保障曾遭受日本侵略的各国和平与安全的任务毫不相干的。正好是遭受日本侵略的痛苦最深，因此对防止日本侵略再起也最关心的那些国家，都被排斥于对日和约的准备工作以外。而且对日和约的准备程序在波茨坦协定与著名的一九四二年
    一月一日联合国宣言中已有规定。波茨坦协定规定由苏、美、中、英、法五国建立五国外长会议，联合国宣言规定不得与曾对盟国及其与国作战的国家缔结单独和约。波茨坦协定明确指出：外长会议的设立，主要是为了进行“和约的准备工作”，而在签订某一和约时，“会议将由在敌国投降书上签字之会员国组成之”。
    因此，关于准备对日和约的程序问题，并没有什么不清楚之处。任何国家，如果不是口头上而是事实上遵守国际协定的义务，就应该按照这些协定的规定，严格地遵守准备对日和约的程序。美国和英国政府一手包办和约的准备工作，现在并强迫他国签订他们所准备的单独对日和约，这是毫无道理的。
    这里应该提一下，以前准备对意大利、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和芬兰的和约时，是按照这种程序进行的。我们可以看到，经验证明苏联和中华人民共和国的要求是正确的，它们的政府曾经再三声明它们对这个问题的意见，认为必须严格地遵守准备对日和约的程序，按这程序必须由外长会议来负责进行准备和约的工作。
    正如与其他国家缔结和约时一样，对日和约的准备工作，当然必须有其他
    一切曾和日本作战的国家参加。苏联早在一九四七年，即是在一九四七年十二月三十日致当时的中国政府的照会及在一九四八年一月四日致英国政府的照会中便曾提出过这样的建议。
    人人都知道，美国政府把准备对日和约的主动权一把抓在自己的手里，违反自己所承担的义务，极力反对把对日和约的准备工作交给外长会议。为了辩解这种态度，它提出一种理由，硬说这种程序会延迟对日和约的准备。事实表明，对上述五国的和约之所以能够早在四年以前签订，正是因为这些条约的准备工作是由外长会议来做的。仅仅说这一点就可以看到那种说法是如何站不住脚了。
    美国和英国政府共同提出了和约草案，它们是采取另一种方针，非法地完全把苏联和中华人民共和国排除于和约的准备工作之外，而没有这两国参加，要想实现对日媾和是根本谈不上的。苏联政府已在它五月七日关于美国对日和约草案的意见书及六月十日的照会中，提醒美国政府注意这些事实。中国人民曾经被迫和侵略他们领土的军国主义日本进行了多年艰苦的战争，在这斗争中遭受了异常巨大的牺牲。正是因为这个缘故，作为表达中国人民意志的唯一合法权威的中华人民共和国政府，是不能被排斥于对日和约的准备工作之外的。苏联政府完全同意中华人民共和国政府在相应的声明中，特别是在它今年五月二十二日与今年八月十五日的声明中对这个问题发表的意见，并坚持中华人民共和国充分参加对日和约的准备工作与讨论。至于那些追随美英之后准备在没有中华人民共和国、印度与缅甸——它们是比其他国家更关心对日媾和的国家——参加的和约上签字的国家，它们对这种不公正的非法行动的后果负有严重的责任。
    摆在目前的旧金山会议面前的是怎样一种局面呢？美国与英国政府使会议面对着一桩事实：中国过去和现在都没有参加对日和约的准备与讨论。显然，在这种情况下，远东是不会有任何真正的媾和的。能够自由公开地表示他们的正义感并为国际和平而奋斗的各国人民能容忍这种情形吗？印度与缅甸拒绝来参加旧金山会议，宣告美英草案是它们所不能接受的。这就是说：被排除于对日和约草案的准备与讨论之外的，不仅是中国一国，而且还有印度，这两个国家是亚洲的主要国家。而美英两国正在强迫参加目前会议的国家接受这个草案。这些行为难道还没有使这个草案的制订者信用扫地吗？难道这还没有说明这种政策已经破产吗？
    苏联并没有拒绝参加旧金山会议。苏联所以这样作，是因为有必要让人人听到美英草案的真象，是因为有必要向会议提出缔结一个真正能够符合远东媾和的利益、有助于巩固普遍和平的对日和约的要求。
    （四）苏联的建议
    苏联代表团考虑到美英对日和约草案不能符合对对日和约的要求，因此建议将美英两国政府提交会议考虑的和约草案，作以下的修正：
            一、关于第二条
    甲、第二条乙、己两项应撤销、另代如下的一项：“日本承认中华人民共和国对满洲、台湾（福摩萨）及附近一切岛屿、澎湖列岛（佩斯卡多尔群岛）、东沙群岛（普拉塔群岛）以及西沙群岛和中沙群岛（巴拉塞尔群岛、阿姆非特里底群岛和玛克斯费尔得沙洲）及南沙群岛（包括南威岛在内）的完全主权，并放弃对本条所述各领土的一切权利、权利根据与要求。”
    乙、第二条丙项应修正如下：“日本承认苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟对库页岛南部及其附近一切岛屿以及千岛群岛的完全主权，并放弃对这些领土的一切权利、权利根据与要求。”

            四、关于第十四条
    甲项及其（一）款撤销，代以如下条文：“日本承认赔偿因对盟国或其与国的军事行动及对某些盟国或其与国领土的占领而造成的损失。日本应付赔偿之数额及来源应由有关各国的会议讨论之，这种会议绝对须有曾遭占领的国家，即中华人民共和国、印度尼西亚、菲律宾和缅甸诸国参加，并邀请日本与会。”
            五、关于第二十三条
    甲项和乙项撤销，代以如下的条文：“本约应由包括日本在内的将予签字的国家批准，并应对以后将批准本约的各该国家，即：澳大利亚、缅甸、加拿大、锡兰、法国、印度、印度尼西亚、荷兰、蒙古人民共和国、新西兰、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、中华人民共和国及美利坚合众国，于日本及下列国家（按，下列各国系指将签字于和约的各国）之过半数，包括美利坚合众国、苏维埃联盟、中华人民共和国、大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国在内，缴存其批准文件后即行发生效力。
    对于其后批准的国家，本约应于各该国家缴存其批准文件之时起发生效力。”
