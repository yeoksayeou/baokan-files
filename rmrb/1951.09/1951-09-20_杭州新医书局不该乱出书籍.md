    Hangzhou New Medical Bookstore Should Not Randomly Publish Books

    To the Editor:

    I bought a book titled "Answers to Higher and Ordinary Examinations for Medical Personnel" (January 1951, third edition, published by Hangzhou New Medical Bookstore, proofread by Fang Zhimin) at Lisheng Bookstore in Baotou. The content of this book is entirely composed of chapters, rules, and regulations promulgated by the puppet National Government, as well as examination questions from the "higher" and "ordinary" examinations held by the puppet government. I find it very strange: why are these stale and corrupt things being published this year?

    Liu Guozhao

    Editor's Note: After the matter was referred to the competent authority for investigation and handling, the original publisher, Hangzhou New Medical Bookstore, has published a self-criticism in the newspaper, deciding to stop the distribution of the book and recall those already sold at the original price. Readers who have already purchased the book are requested to take note.

专栏：读者来信

    杭州新医书局不该乱出书籍编辑同志：
    我在包头市力生书店买了一本“高等普通考试医事人员试题解答”（一九五一年一月三版，杭州新医书局发行，方植民校阅）。这本书的内容全是伪国民政府颁布的一些章则、法令和伪政府举行“高等”、“普通”考试时的试题。我很奇怪：为什么在今年还把这些陈腐的东西拿来出版。
    刘国藻
    编者按：此事经转请主管机关查明处理后，原出版者杭州新医书局已登报检讨，决定将该书停止发行，已售出者按原价收回。希已购该书的读者注意。
