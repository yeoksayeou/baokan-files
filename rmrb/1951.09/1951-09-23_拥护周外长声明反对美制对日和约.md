    Endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement Opposing the US-Japan Peace Treaty

    (I) Editor:

    We fully endorse the solemn statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on September 18th, denouncing the San Francisco Peace Treaty signed by the United States and its vassal states. This statement exposes the US imperialist plot to use Japan to invade Asia, raising our vigilance against new US imperialist aggression!

    During the Japanese occupation, only a dozen trams ran in Beijing each day, and sometimes only one. Our monthly wages were only enough to last for seven days. Life at that time was worse than that of cattle and horses! Now, after more than two years of recovery and development since liberation, our factory is producing over one hundred and thirty trams. Recently, we also implemented the "eight-grade wage system," adjusting and increasing the wages of all workers in the factory. All of this was only possible after defeating Japanese imperialism and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by US imperialism.

    To defend our good life, we are determined to take practical action to oppose the US's separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearming of Japan. We have decided to install safety equipment on all vehicles before National Day, with riveters, lathe operators, draftsmen, electricians, foundry workers, welders, overhaul and maintenance teams, all contributing their efforts to complete this task voluntarily and rapidly.

    (II) Editor:

    The signing of the separate US-British peace treaty with Japan completely disregards the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, disregards the immense sacrifices and great contributions of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and blatantly stipulates the revival of Japanese militarism and the rearming of Japan. In particular, the "US-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty" even more blatantly aims to make Japan a tool for US imperialism to expand its war of aggression in Asia, seriously threatening our country's security and peace in Asia.

    We unanimously endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement of September 18th, and are determined to study politics diligently, improve our professional skills, do our work well, and fight to the end to build a strong people's navy, consolidate our national defense, and liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan.

    (III) Editor:

    I fully endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's statement regarding the San Francisco Peace Treaty signed by the United States and its vassal states. I am a young man from the Northeast. I will never forget the "September 18th" incident. The victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, won by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people, was bought with blood and sweat, and the Chinese people made the greatest sacrifices. Our international friends—Dr. Bethune, Captain Kulishenko... also shed their blood on our soil. It is only natural that the American warmongers' violent and unreasonable signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan has aroused opposition from people all over the world.

    However, today's China is not the China of twenty years ago under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The Chinese people have stood up! The workers of the Northeast are answering US imperialism with an increase in production and savings of ten million tons of grain; the laborers on the Huai River are answering US imperialism with the fundamental control of the Huai River to achieve a bumper harvest; I will implement the resolutions of the student representatives' meeting in my studies and work, cultivate myself into a cadre with both ability and integrity, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time to answer US imperialism.

    (IV) Editor:

    We, the two hundred and eight model teachers participating in the Hebei Handan Prefecture Model Teachers Conference, firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement of August 15th, opposing the separate US-British peace treaty with Japan. We are determined to unite all cultural and educational workers in the prefecture, strengthen patriotic ideological education to resist US aggression and aid Korea, so that all students and the people of the whole region recognize that the separate US-British peace treaty with Japan is a plan to launch a war of aggression. We must educate the people to step up patriotic production, respond to the three major appeals of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, do a good job in preferential treatment, check and revise patriotic pledges, donate airplanes and cannons, and support the front line with practical actions. We are determined to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improve our political and ideological level, do all our work well, consolidate the national defense, and strive to the end for the conclusion of a peaceful, comprehensive, and just peace treaty with Japan!

### 拥护周外长声明反对美制对日和约

专栏：读者来信

    拥护周外长声明反对美制对日和约
    （一）编辑同志：
    我们完全拥护外交部周恩来部长九月十八日痛斥美国及其仆从国家签订旧金山对日和约的严正声明。这个声明，揭露了美帝国主义利用日本侵略亚洲的阴谋，提高了我们对于美帝国主义的新的侵略阴谋的警惕！
    在日寇占领期间，北京的电车每天只出十几辆，最低时只出一辆。我们每月的工资，只能够七天用，那时的生活真是不如牛马！现在，我们的工厂，经过解放后二年多的恢复和发展，出车数已经超过了一百三十辆了，最近我们又实行了“八级工资制”，调整和增加了全厂工人的工资。这一切都是在打垮了日本帝国主义，消灭了美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪帮以后才得到的。
    为了保卫我们的好生活，我们决定用实际行动，反对美国单独对日媾和与重新武装日本。我们决定在国庆节前把全部车辆的防险设备安装起来，由铆工、镟工、案工、电工、铸工、电焊、大修、检修等各组，抽出力量，义务突击完成。

    （二）编辑同志：
    美英单独对日和约的签订，完全漠视了中华人民共和国的正当权利，抹煞了我国人民在抗日战争中的巨大牺牲和伟大贡献，并且明目张胆地规定复活日本军国主义，重新武装日本。尤其“美日双边安全条约”，更露骨地要使日本成为美帝国主义在亚洲扩大侵略战争的工具，它严重地威胁着我国的安全与亚洲的和平。
    我们一致拥护周外长九月十八日的严正声明，决心努力学习政治，提高业务水平，搞好工作，为建设一支强大的人民海军、为巩固我国海防、为解放我们神圣的领土台湾奋斗到底。

    （三）编辑同志：
    我完全拥护周外长关于美国及其仆从国家签订旧金山对日和约的声明。我是一个东北青年。“九一八”这个日子，我永远不能忘记。中国共产党和毛主席领导中国人民赢得的抗日战争的胜利，是用血和汗换来的，中国人民曾付出了最大的牺牲。我们的国际友人——白求恩大夫、库里申科大队长……也把鲜血流在我们的国土上。美国战争贩子狂暴无理地签订单独对日和约，引起全世界人民的反对是理所当然的。
    但是，今天的中国已不是二十年前蒋匪介石统治的中国了。中国人民已经站起来了！东北工人以增产节约一千万吨粮食回答美帝国主义；江淮民工以根治淮河争取丰收回答美帝国主义；我要在学习、工作中贯彻学生代表会决议，培养自己成为才德兼备的干部，随时响应祖国号召来回答美帝国主义。

    （四）编辑同志：
    我们参加河北邯郸专区模范教师会议的二百零八名模范教师，坚决拥护周外长八月十五日的严正声明，反对美英单独对日媾和。我们决团结全专区的文教工作者，加强抗美援朝的爱国主义思想教育，使所有学生和全区人民认识美英单独对日媾和是发动侵略战争的计划。我们要教育人民，加紧爱国增产，响应抗美援朝总会三大号召，作好优抚工作，检查、修订爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮，以实际行动支援前线。我们决心要学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，提高政治思想水平，做好一切工作，巩固国防事业，为缔结和平的、全面的、公正的对日和约而奋斗到底！
