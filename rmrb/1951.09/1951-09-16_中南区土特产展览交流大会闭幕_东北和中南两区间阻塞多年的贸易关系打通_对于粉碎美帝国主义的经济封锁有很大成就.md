The Central-South China Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference concluded on the 10th. The conference lasted 75 days, with a total transaction volume of 812.9 billion yuan. The Northeast China Industrial and Commercial Delegation purchased a total of 29 billion yuan worth of various native products in Hankou, connecting the trade relations between the Central-South and Northeast regions that had been obstructed for many years. The sales volume of unsalable native products from various parts of Central-South China accounted for 16 percent of the total transaction volume of the conference. Many native products and some medicinal materials have changed from unsalable to fast-selling.

This conference spurred the rapid development of business in transportation, postal and telecommunications, banking and other departments. For example, during the conference, more than 6,700 tons of native products were exported and imported through Wuhan. In May, June, and July before and after the opening of the conference, the volume of goods transported by the Beijing-Hankou Railway through Wuhan increased by more than double compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency: The Central-South China Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference has made great achievements in smashing the economic blockade of U.S. imperialism. The supply and demand sides of many important industrial raw materials were satisfied at the conference. For example, the Northeast needed turpentine, coconut oil, etc., which had always relied on imports, and the Northeast delegation ordered a batch from Guangdong at this conference. The Guangdong paper industry lacked raw materials, and the Guangdong delegation ordered a batch of pulp from the Hunan delegation. The native products of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, which had always relied on foreign sales, are also selling well domestically.

    中南区土特产展览交流大会闭幕
    东北和中南两区间阻塞多年的贸易关系打通
    对于粉碎美帝国主义的经济封锁有很大成就
    中南区土特产展览交流大会已于十日闭幕。这次大会为期七十五天，交易总额八千一百二十九亿多元。东北区工商代表团共在汉口采购各种土特产总值二百九十亿元，沟通了中南和东北两区阻塞多年的贸易关系。中南区各地滞销土产的销售量占大会成交总额的百分之十六。许多土特产和部分药材都已由滞销变为畅销。
    这次大会带动了运输、邮电、银行等部门的业务迅速发展。例如，大会期间经武汉市输出输入的土特产达六千七百多吨。在大会开幕前后的五、六、七月间，京汉铁路经武汉市运输的货物，比去年同期增加了一倍以上。
    中南区土特产展览交流大会在粉碎美帝国主义的经济封锁方面有很大成就。许多重要的工业原料，供销双方都在大会中得到满足。例如东北需要的松节油、椰子油等，一向依赖进口，东北代表团在这次大会中就向广东订购了一批。广东造纸工业缺乏原料，广东代表团就向湖南代表团订购了一批纸浆。一向依赖外销的广东、广西两省土特产，也已畅销国内。（新华社）
