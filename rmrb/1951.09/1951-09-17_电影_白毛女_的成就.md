The fact that the film "The White Haired Girl" won the First Special Honorary Award out of thirty-eight special honorary awards at this year's Sixth International Film Festival is not accidental. The opera "The White Haired Girl" was widely performed throughout the country during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. It educated people of all strata, especially enlightening the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, thereby contributing to the Chinese people's victorious struggle to overthrow imperialism and feudalism.

Due to the revolutionary literary and art workers correctly implementing Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, the opera and film "The White Haired Girl" revealed the class oppression of Chinese feudal society and the crimes of the landlord class with considerable depth and completeness in art. It expressed the profound suffering and tenacious resistance of Chinese peasants under long-term feudal oppression, and created a fairly representative character image—Xi'er—that embodies this suffering and resistance.

"The White Haired Girl" has fully demonstrated our national characteristics in terms of its artistic form and style, as well as in its absorption of folk music to create the opera's music. Because of the high achievements of "The White Haired Girl" in ideology and art, the opera "The White Haired Girl" has been warmly welcomed by the people of the whole country, allowing it to appear on the stage of Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, and soon it will also appear on the stage of Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. The film "The White Haired Girl" has received international praise and honor, and will also be more loved by the people of the whole country.

"The White Haired Girl" is not only a collective creation of art workers, but also a collective creation of Chinese peasants. The film is adapted from the opera, and the opera is based on folk legends. The folk legend of the White Haired Girl began to spread in the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area between 1938 and 1943. We have heard several versions of the legend with varying degrees of detail, each more complete than the last. It can be seen that the story of the White Haired Girl has been gradually enriched by the peasants in the process of its spread. Judging from the original legend, the story of the White Haired Girl was created after the establishment of the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area. The original story ended with the rescue of the White Haired Girl after liberation, thus forming the healthy and vigorous spirit of this folk legend, which laid a solid foundation for the later opera and film "The White Haired Girl."

The film "The White Haired Girl" has its own different new achievements compared to the opera "The White Haired Girl." This is not only because the performance form has a broader scene and makes up for some defects in the plot, but also because the theme of the film "The White Haired Girl" has a more profound and complete expression.

When the first few shots of the film appear, one deeply feels how beautiful and fertile the motherland's fields are, opened up by the diligent and brave working people! The majestic peaks, the vast land, and the full ears of grain herald a good harvest; the undulating grass slopes graze cattle and sheep; but, unfortunately, the old society was filled with feudal oppression and exploitation. Then, a series of strong contrasts appear on the screen between the landlord class living comfortably without working and the peasants working hard but being poorly clothed.

At the beginning of the film, such a clear ideology leaves a deep impression on the audience. Then, with a very strong appeal, it tells the story of the White Haired Girl, praising Xi'er's tenacious and unyielding life.

The director made Xi'er's image in the film more complete, her character more prominent, and reasonably showed her growth process. Xi'er's class hatred and continuous improvement of class consciousness are the driving force that enables her to live so tenaciously. In the film, we not only clearly see the growth of Xi'er's class consciousness, but also deeply feel that Xi'er's tenacity and perseverance are a concentrated reflection of the suffering years and rebellious spirit of Chinese peasants under the cruel oppression of the feudal system for thousands of years.

The reasons for the growth of Xi'er's class consciousness are also fully explained in the film. That is, from her own experience, she realized that she and the landlord class are irreconcilable. Huang Shiren killed her father, drove away Dachun, ruined her, and finally wanted to sell her. When she fled to the river, she also heard Huang Shiren say: "If I can't see the body, I want to see the living person," and told Lao Mu to tell the county government: "Wherever she (Xi'er) escapes, I will get her there." This made Xi'er clearly recognize that the hatred was not only between her and the Huang family, but between the oppressed peasants and the feudal landlord class. On the other hand, the influence of the Communist Party—the Red Army in Hexi—gave her hope and promoted her class consciousness. On New Year's Eve, Uncle Zhao told them the story of the Red Army, saying, "Once you cross the Yellow River, you will reach the Red Army's place," and the Red Army "will come one day." Later, Dachun really went to Hexi to find the Red Army. Therefore, when life was extremely difficult, she often thought of Dachun, thought of the Red Army, and hoped that the Red Army would come soon.

The film also closely surrounds Xi'er's class essence and class consciousness when describing the love between Xi'er and Dachun. On the eve of the wedding, Xi'er sang and pasted mandarin duck paper-cuts, full of happiness. After being dragged into the Huang family, she always missed Dachun. She desperately wanted to escape with Dachun, and after being discovered, she told Dachun not to care about her. When she was tortured in every possible way, she still wished Dachun an early arrival in Hexi. In the severe cold of the deep mountains, she still thought of Dachun, hoping for his early return. She has such a deep and unbreakable love for Dachun because they are class brothers and sisters, they grew up together working, and they established love in labor. Conversely, Xi'er's disgust for Huang Shiren is due to class hatred. This was revealed from the beginning, and became more obvious after being dragged into the Huang family. She didn't want the Huang family's clothes, and took off the ones she was wearing and threw them away when she left. This clear love and hatred made Xi'er's image more complete and prominent.

The film "The White Haired Girl" has deepened class hatred in many ways. Old Fifth Uncle took the seeds for the coming year to pay the rent, but was deprived of his tenancy for owing only seven and a half liters to the Huang family. Old Fifth Uncle's broken straw hat and broken shoes were left on the well platform, while the Huang family's big mules and carts pulled away the grain that the peasants had worked hard for a year to harvest. Huangjiachuan finally had a good harvest year, but Huang Shiren wanted to recover the rent owed over the years. The landlord class does not want the peasants to be well-fed and well-clothed. The director repeatedly used contrasts to deepen people's hatred for the landlord class and to express infinite sympathy for the peasants. When Huang Shiren raped Xi'er, the camera rose to a plaque that read "Great Mercy and Compassion," and then the "Accumulating Virtue Hall" plaque at the entrance of the Huang family appeared. Huang's mother was knocking on a wooden fish in the Buddhist hall, followed by Huang Shiren opening the account book of grain rents to exploit the peasants in the study. The film uses such deep class hatred to expose the landlord class's insidious and viciousness, hypocrisy and shamelessness.

This deep hatred is also expressed in Yang Bailao's intention to die at the Huang family's door with a belly full of resentment after drinking brine. This hatred is also expressed in the scene where Xi'er met Huang Shiren in the temple and chased him out. Huang Shiren said she was a "ghost," and she stood on the cliff and accused him, saying, "You forced me to become like this. You say I am a ghost, I am a ghost, I am a ghost who died unjustly, a ghost who died in vain."

Because the film "The White Haired Girl" is permeated with strong class hatred, clear love and hatred, although Yang Bailao and Xi'er's experiences are very tragic, what we feel is not tragedy, but indignation; not only sympathy, but also vigor; Xi'er's tenacity and perseverance inspire people's will to live; the peasants' experiences and hatred are like our own experiences. With such ideological and artistic creation, the film director has given the audience a profound class education.

The actress who played Xi'er created a deeper image than on the stage and should be given a fairly high evaluation. Most of the other actors are also competent. The music of the film "The White Haired Girl" is also very successful. The photography, sound recording and other staff all showed excellent results. Without the success of these aspects, there would be no achievement of the film "The White Haired Girl."

Some scenes in the film "The White Haired Girl" are also inferior to the stage play. For example, Yang Bailao dying in the snow and Mu Renzhi dragging Xi'er away are indeed less moving than the opera. The constant jumping of the shots diluted the emotions of grief and anger. The most obvious is that when Mu Renzhi dragged Xi'er away, the shot jumped from in front of Yang Bailao's body to the entrance of the Huang family, so that the climax of this scene was not reached. On the stage, Xi'er was dragged away and broke free and ran back, and was dragged away again, which made the audience shed tears uncontrollably. The director did not complete this important plot well. A situation similar to this scene is the scene of the struggle meeting in the back. The struggle meeting, as a display of Xi'er and the peasants' liberation and a declaration of the death of the old social system, should be given a strong rendering and expression. However, the director dealt with it so hastily. Xi'er's character was not clearly completed. The peasants' hatred that had been suppressed for thousands of years was not fully expressed. The excited emotions of the Xi'ers, who had been persecuted for a long time, once they were victoriously liberated, were not fully expressed.

The film "The White Haired Girl" once again demonstrated the new achievements of the people's film industry, which is the result of correctly embodying Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. (Attached picture)

    电影“白毛女”的成就
    羽山
    电影“白毛女”在今年举行的六届国际电影赛会上，获得三十八个特别荣誉奖中的第一特别荣誉奖，并不是偶然的。歌剧“白毛女”曾在抗日战争和解放战争中，普遍地在全国各地上演。它教育了各阶层人民，特别是启发了广大工农兵的阶级觉悟，从而有助于中国人民为推翻帝国主义、封建主义的胜利的斗争。
    由于革命的文艺工作者正确地执行了毛主席的文艺路线，歌剧和电影“白毛女”在艺术上以相当的深刻性和完整性，来揭露了中国封建社会的阶级压迫与地主阶级的罪恶，表现了中国农民在长期封建压迫下的深重苦难和坚韧顽强的反抗意志，并塑造了一个体现这种苦难和反抗意志的相当代表性的人物形象——喜儿。
    “白毛女”在艺术形式上和风格上，以及它吸取了民间音乐所创造的歌剧音乐方面，都比较充分地表现了我们民族的特色。因为“白毛女”在思想与艺术方面的高度成就，使歌剧“白毛女”受到了全国人民热烈的欢迎，使它出现在捷克京城布拉格的舞台上，不久又将出现在苏联首都莫斯科的舞台上，使电影“白毛女”获得国际的称颂与荣誉，也将得到全国人民更高的热爱。
    “白毛女”不仅是艺术工作者的集体创作，而且是中国农民的集体创作。电影根据歌剧改编，歌剧则根据民间传说创作。民间传说的白毛女故事是一九三八年到一九四三年间在晋察冀抗日根据地流传开的。我们曾听到几种程度不同的传说，一次比一次更充实。可见白毛女故事在流传中，已经被农民们逐渐地丰富了。由原传说看来，白毛女故事是在晋察冀抗日根据地建立起来以后才编成的。原来的故事就是以解放后白毛女得救作结束的，因而形成这一民间传说的健康奋发的情绪，为后来的歌剧与电影“白毛女”打下了坚实的基础。
    电影“白毛女”比起歌剧“白毛女”有着它不同的新的成就。这不仅因为表现形式上有着更广阔的场面和对几个情节上的缺陷作了弥补，而且因为电影“白毛女”的主题思想有着更深刻更完整的表现。
    当电影的最初几个镜头显现出来的时候，使人深深地感到：由勤劳勇敢的劳动人民所开辟的祖国田园是多么秀丽，丰沃啊！那巍峨的山峰，那广阔的大地，那饱满的谷穗，预示着丰收；那起伏的草坡，放牧着牛羊；但，不幸的是旧社会存在着封建压迫和剥削。接着银幕上出现了一连串地主阶级不劳而获过着舒服生活，农民们辛勤劳动却衣不蔽体的强烈对比。
    电影一开头就以如此鲜明的思想性给观众留下深刻的印象。接着又用非常强烈的感染力，来向人们叙述出白毛女的故事，歌颂着喜儿的顽强不屈的生活。
    编导者使电影里喜儿的形象更加完整，性格更加突出，并合理地使人看出她的成长过程。喜儿的阶级仇恨和阶级觉悟的不断提高是使她能够那么顽强地生活下去的动力。在电影中，我们不仅清楚地看到喜儿阶级意识的成长，而且使人深刻地感到：喜儿的顽强、坚韧的意志，正是集中地体现出中国农民在几千年封建制度的残酷压迫下的苦难岁月和反抗精神。
    喜儿的阶级意识成长的原因，在电影里也得到了充分的说明。这就是从她自身的遭遇中，她认识到和地主阶级是势不两立的。黄世仁害死了她爹，逼走了大春，糟踏了她，最后还想把她卖掉。当她逃到河边，还听到黄世仁说：“见不了尸首我要见活人”，叫老穆告诉县衙门：“她（喜儿）逃到那儿，我拿到那儿。”这使喜儿明确地认清了：仇恨不仅是她和黄家之间的，而是被压迫的农民和封建地主阶级之间的。另一方面，共产党的影响——红军在河西，使她有了希望，促进了她的阶级觉悟。年三十赵大叔给他们讲红军的故事就说：“过了黄河就到了红军的地方”，红军“总有一天会来的”。后来大春又真的到河西找红军去了。因此在生活异常艰难的时候，她时常想到大春，想到红军，盼红军快来。
    电影在描写喜儿和大春的爱情时，也紧紧地围绕着喜儿的阶级本质和阶级觉悟的。在结婚的前夜，喜儿边唱边贴着鸳鸯剪纸，充满着幸福的喜悦。被拉进黄家后，她时时想念着大春。她不顾一切地要跟大春逃走，被发觉以后又叫大春不要管她。她在被百般地折磨时，还祝福大春早到河西。在深山的严寒中，还想着大春，盼他早日归来。她对大春有这么深厚的牢不可破的爱，是因为他们是同阶级的兄妹，他们是在劳动中一块长大，在劳动中建立起来的爱情。反之，喜儿对黄世仁的嫌恶是由于阶级的仇恨。这从一开始就表露出来了，被拉进黄家后更加明显。她不要黄家的衣服，临走时连身上穿着的也脱下来扔开。这种鲜明的爱和憎，使喜儿的形象更趋完整，更为突出。
    电影“白毛女”在许多方面都更加深化了阶级仇恨。老五叔把来年的种子都拿来交了租，可是仅仅欠黄家七升五合就被夺了佃。老五叔的破草帽破鞋在井台上扔着，黄家的大骡子大车却拉走了农民们一年辛苦所打下的粮食。黄家川好容易有了一个好年景，黄世仁却要追讨历年的欠租。地主阶级是不喜欢农民们吃饱穿暖的。编导者许多次地运用对比来加深了人们对地主阶级的憎恨，对农民们寄以无限同情。当黄世仁强奸喜儿时，镜头上升是一块“大慈大悲”的匾，接着又出现了黄家门口的“积善堂”大匾。黄母在佛堂敲着木鱼，接着是黄世仁在书房翻开剥削农民的租粮账。电影以这样深刻的阶级仇恨来揭露地主阶级的阴险和狠毒，伪善和无耻。
    这种深刻的仇恨也表现在杨白劳喝卤以后，怀着满腔怨恨地要去死在黄家门上。这种仇恨也表现在喜儿在庙里遇见黄世仁，追了出来的情节上。黄世仁说她是“鬼”，她站在崖石上控诉着说：“是你们把我逼成这样子，你们说我是鬼，我就是鬼，我是屈死的鬼，冤死的鬼。”
    由于电影“白毛女”贯穿着强烈的阶级仇恨，鲜明的爱和憎，因此虽然杨白劳和喜儿的遭遇非常凄惨，但它使我们感受到的不是凄惨，而是激愤；不仅是同情，而且是奋发；喜儿的坚韧顽强，激励着人们生活的意志；农民们的遭遇和仇恨，如同我们亲身的经受。电影编导者以这样思想性和艺术性的创造，使观众获得了深刻的阶级教育。
    饰演喜儿的演员，创造了比舞台上更深厚的形象，应当得到相当高度的评价。其他的演员也大都是称职的。电影“白毛女”的音乐也是很成功的。摄影录音等工作人员都表现了优秀的成绩。没有这些方面的成功，也就没有电影“白毛女”的成就。
    电影“白毛女”的某些场面也有不及舞台剧的地方。如杨白劳死在雪地里，穆仁智拉走喜儿一场，的确不如歌剧感动人。镜头的不断跳动，冲淡了悲愤和激怒的情绪。最明显的是穆仁智拉走喜儿时，镜头从杨白劳尸体前中断后跳到黄家门口，使这一场戏的高潮没有掀起。舞台上喜儿被拉走又挣脱跑回，再被拉走，使观众压抑不住地流下了眼泪。编导者没有很好地完成这一重要的情节。与这一场差不多的情形是后面的斗争大会场面。斗争大会作为显示喜儿和农民们得到解放，宣告旧的社会制度的死亡，应当给以强有力的渲染和表现。可是编导者却处理得这般草率。使喜儿的性格未得到明确的完成。农民们被压迫了几千年的仇恨没有得到充分的申张。喜儿们长期受迫害，一旦获得胜利解放的激动情绪没有得到圆满的表现。
    电影“白毛女”又一次表现了人民电影事业的新成就，这是正确地体现了毛主席文艺思想的结果。（附图片）
