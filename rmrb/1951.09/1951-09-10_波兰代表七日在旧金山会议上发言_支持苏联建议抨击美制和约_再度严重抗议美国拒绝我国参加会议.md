Xinhua News Agency Report: Polish representative, Mr. Will Brobrowski, spoke at the plenary session on the afternoon of September 7th, criticizing the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan and supporting the Soviet delegation's proposals.

Will Brobrowski said: The reason why the Polish delegation wants to speak on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan is first because this treaty, although mainly concerned with the peace in the Far East, is inseparable from the issue of world peace. After discussing the process of the United States' preparation of a separate peace treaty with Japan, the Polish representative emphasized that the United States has ceased to abide by its international obligations and has embarked on a path of illegal unilateral action. Will Brobrowski said: Today in San Francisco, the United States has further violated these decisions, and on such a major issue as peace in the Far East. It openly disregards clear provisions and does not entrust the preparatory work for the treaty to the Council of Foreign Ministers, and then discuss it at a broad international conference.

Will Brobrowski pointed out: The United States' refusal to allow the People's Republic of China to participate in resolving the issue of peace with Japan is one of the most shameless and arrogant actions in international relations. This legitimate government, exercising power over all Chinese territory, has the indisputable and sacred right to express its important opinions on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. Concluding a treaty without China's participation is equivalent to signing a document that has nothing to do with peace and becomes a harbinger of a new war. On behalf of the Polish delegation, I once again lodge a serious protest against the United States' methods against the great Chinese people.

When discussing the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan, Will Brobrowski pointed out: While forcing others to accept its draft treaty, the United States decided to apply a modernized and expanded Monroe Doctrine to Japan. The characteristic of this doctrine is insatiable greed, and it wants to include one region after another on the earth within the scope of American interests. The United States decided to include Japan in the American base and territory system where the United States intends to station armed forces.

The Polish representative further elaborated on the Soviet delegation's proposals and pointed out: The Polish delegation fully supports the Soviet delegation's proposals regarding the territorial clauses in the treaty.

Will Brobrowski actively supported the Soviet delegation's proposals to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and the revival of various fascist and militaristic organizations. He said: We support the Soviet proposal to prohibit Japan from concluding any military alliances and to prohibit Japan from participating in any alliances against any country that sent troops to participate in the war against Japan. The military alliance against the Soviet Union and China that the United States is preparing in the Far East will drag Japan into this conspiracy, which this time is aimed at the people of the socialist camp.

    波兰代表七日在旧金山会议上发言
    支持苏联建议抨击美制和约
    再度严重抗议美国拒绝我国参加会议
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基在九月七日下午的全体会议上抨击美英对日和约草案，支持苏联代表团的建议。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基说：波兰代表团所以要就对日和约问题发言，首先是因为这个和约虽然主要是关乎远东和平的问题，但是它与全世界和平的问题也是不可分的。波兰代表在谈了美国准备单独对日和约的经过以后，着重指出美国已不再遵守它所承担的国际义务，而是走上了非法的片面行动的道路。威尔勃洛夫斯基说：今天在旧金山，美国已进一步违反这些决定，而且是在远东和平这样重大的问题上。它公然藐视明确的规定，不把和约的准备工作交给外长会议，然后再在广泛的国际会议上讨论。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基指出：美国拒绝让中华人民共和国参加解决对日媾和问题，这是它在国际关系上一件最无耻最专横的行动。这个在全中国领土上行使权力的合法的政府，具有无可置辩的神圣权利在对日和约的问题上发表它重要的意见。缔结没有中国参加的和约，等于是签订一个与和平毫不相干而且成为新战争先兆的文件。我代表波兰代表团对美国对伟大的中国人民的这种手段，再度提出严重的抗议。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基在谈到美英对日和约草案时指出：美国在强迫人家接受它的和约草案时，决定把现代化的和扩大了的门罗主义应用到日本身上，这个主义的特性在贪得无餍，它想把地球上一个又一个的地域包括到美国利益范围之内。美国决定把日本包括到美国打算在上面留驻武装部队的美国基地和领土体系之内。
    波兰代表进而详论苏联代表团的建议，并指出：波兰代表团完全支持苏联代表团关于条约中的领土条款的建议。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基积极地支持苏联代表团关于防止日本军国主义复活，防止各种法西斯和军国主义组织复活的建议。他说：我们支持苏联所提出的建议，即禁止日本缔结任何军事联盟，禁止日本参加反对曾出兵参加对日作战的任何国家的联盟。美国正在远东准备的反对苏联和中国的军事联盟，将把日本拖入这一次是针对社会主义阵营各国人民的阴谋中。
