    Some members of the Central People's Government Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Delegation's Hunan-Jiangxi Sub-Delegation arrived in Ninggang County, Jiangxi Province, on August 26th, and visited Maoping, Dalong at the foot of Jinggang Mountain, and Dawan Village in Jiulong Mountain, among other townships. When the local people heard that Chairman Mao had sent representatives, they formed lines, lit firecrackers, and warmly welcomed the visiting delegation. When they saw the comrades of the visiting delegation, they felt as if they were seeing relatives, and they told them about the suffering they had endured under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang after the Red Army went north to fight against the Japanese, as well as the happy life they were living after liberation. They were comforted by the comrades of the visiting delegation and enjoyed the performances of the cultural troupe, and they deeply thanked Chairman Mao for his concern for them. Many people wanted the visiting delegation to take gifts to Chairman Mao to express their feelings. Some sent large packages of red leaves from Jinggang Mountain, and some sent large red flags. The people of Maoping Village, in order to send the local famous food - dogfish (also known as "wawa" fish, with a flat head, small eyes, four legs, no spines, and a fresh taste; Ninggang County only has it near a pool in Maoping Village and is difficult to catch) - to Chairman Mao, lit torches at night to catch it. Farmer Xie Dongfang and others stayed up all night and finally caught a dogfish. Everyone was extremely happy and said, "We can send this rare thing to Chairman Mao." The entire people of Ninggang County also firmly stated that they would respond to Chairman Mao's instructions: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" by increasing production and actively participating in the resistance against America and aid to Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

    When 119 model militiamen in Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, were holding a meeting to summarize their work for the past six months, they heard the county head report the news that Chairman Mao had sent a delegation to visit the people in our northern old revolutionary base areas. They also saw the various gifts brought back by the county head and the instruction written by Chairman Mao, "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." Everyone was happy and full of energy. Zhang Yaoting said: "Chairman Mao really cares about us. We must remember Chairman Mao's instructions well. We know that today's victory is only the first step after the Long March. We must continue to work hard and strive for greater victory. Now that the American devils have launched a war of aggression, we must consolidate our national defense, defend our motherland, and strive for greater glory." Liu Jingui said: "We must thoroughly publicize the news that Chairman Mao has sent a delegation to visit the people in the old revolutionary base areas to the masses. We must also lead the militia to study politics, overcome all complacency, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. During the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, we must not only work hard to produce, but also strictly guard against sabotage activities by counter-revolutionaries." Finally, everyone unanimously stated that they would respond to Chairman Mao's concern for them with practical patriotic actions. We must establish the idea of consolidating national defense and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. And they formulated four plans for the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting work: 1. Lead all militiamen to strengthen political study. 2. Lead all militiamen to participate in mutual aid teams and do a good job in autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. 3. Seriously review the militia organization and maintain the purity of the militia organization. 4. Be vigilant, take turns patrolling at night, strictly prevent sabotage by secret agents, and ensure that the autumn harvest is not lost. Seriously implement the patriotic pledge.

    江西宁冈及山西襄垣等老根据地人民
    感谢毛主席派人访问
    （一）
    中央人民政府南方老根据地访问团湘赣分团一部分团员，在八月二十六日到达江西省宁冈县，分别到井冈山下的茅坪、大陇和九龙山的大湾等乡进行访问。当地人民听说毛主席派人来了，都列起队来，燃放爆竹，热烈地欢迎访问团的代表们。他们看见访问团的同志，就像看见了亲人一样，纷纷诉说红军北上抗日后，他们在国民党反动统治下所受的痛苦，以及解放后的幸福生活。他们受到了访问团同志的慰问，看了文工团的表演，都深深感谢毛主席对他们的关心。很多人要访问团替他们带礼物给毛主席，来表示他们的心意。有人送大包井冈山的红叶，有人送大红旗。茅坪村的人民为了要把当地名贵的食物——狗鱼（又名哇哇鱼，头扁平，眼小，有四只脚，无刺，味鲜，宁冈县仅茅坪村附近一个潭里有，很难捉到。）送给毛主席，纷纷在夜间点着火把去捉。农民谢东芳等一夜没睡，终于捉到了狗鱼。大家高兴极了，都说：“我们可以把这难得的东西送给毛主席了。”宁冈县全体人民并且坚决表示：要以提高生产，积极参加抗美援朝、镇压反革命等实际行动，来响应毛主席的指示：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。

    山西襄垣县一百一十九个模范民兵正在开会总结半年工作时，听到县长报告毛主席派代表团访问我们北方老根据地人民的消息，还看到县长带回来的各种礼物和毛主席写的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示，大家个个高兴，满身带劲。张耀廷说：“毛主席对我们真关心。我们一定要好好记住毛主席的指示。我们知道今天的胜利，是万里长征才走完了第一步。我们必须继续努力，争取更大的胜利。现在美国鬼子发动了侵略战争，我们要巩固国防，保卫祖国，争取更大光荣。”刘金贵说：“我们要把毛主席派代表团来访问老根据地人民的消息，向群众深入宣传。还要带领民兵学习政治，克服一切麻痹思想，随时准备响应祖国号召。在秋收、秋耕、秋种中，我们一方面要努力生产，一方面要严防反革命分子的破坏活动。”最后，大家一致表示：要以爱国的实际行动，回答毛主席对自己的关怀。要树立巩固国防思想，随时准备响应祖国的召唤。并订出秋收、秋耕、秋种工作中的四条计划：一、带领全体民兵，加强政治学习。二、带领全体民兵参加互助组，做好秋收、秋耕、秋种工作。三、认真审查民兵组织，保持民兵组织的纯洁性。提高警惕，轮流巡夜，严防特务破坏，保证秋收不受损失。四、认真执行爱国公约。
