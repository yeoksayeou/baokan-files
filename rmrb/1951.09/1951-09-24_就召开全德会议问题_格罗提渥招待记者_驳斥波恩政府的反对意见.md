    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 23rd] According to TASS Berlin, September 22nd: The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke, and Foreign Minister Didinger, held a press conference in Berlin on September 21st regarding the question of convening an All-German Conference to hold All-German elections.

    Prime Minister Grotewohl spoke first, saying: The People's Chamber's proposal to the Federal Assembly regarding the convening of an All-German Conference to hold free All-German elections has aroused unprecedented enthusiastic support from the German people, who believe that this proposal is the real method for solving the future of the entire German people. Grotewohl refuted one by one the objections and counter-proposals made by the politicians of Bonn and West Berlin to this proposal. He pointed out that the purpose of these objections and counter-proposals is to diminish the great significance of the People's Chamber's proposal in the eyes of the people and to divert the people's attention. Grotewohl pointed out that the claim that the unification of Berlin can promote the unification of Germany is incorrect, that this is a tactic whose purpose is to divert the attention of the German people from the issue of unifying all of Germany. He emphasized that the first step towards seriously discussing the question of unifying Germany is to convene an All-German Conference.

    In answering a reporter's question about what kind of election law the National Assembly should use to conduct elections, Grotewohl and Nuschke both pointed out that there are many different election laws that can be adopted, but at present, the most important issue is not the election law, but the convening of an All-German Conference in order to discuss this issue and related issues.

    A reporter asked: If the Federal Assembly refuses to convene an All-German Conference, what will the government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic do? Grotewohl replied: Besides the members of the Bonn Parliament, there are millions of ordinary German people who demand peace and the unification of Germany. Therefore, it is no accident that the People's Chamber is appealing to them, asking them to support its proposal. The German people will show their determination to ensure that the All-German Conference can be convened, and will loudly demand that a peace treaty with Germany be concluded as soon as possible.

    就召开全德会议问题
    格罗提渥招待记者
    驳斥波恩政府的反对意见
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十二日讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、副总理努舍克以及外交部长窦丁格尔，于九月二十一日在柏林就召开全德会议以举行全德选举的问题举行了记者招待会。
    格罗提渥总理首先发言说：人民议会向联邦议会所提出的关于召开全德会议以举行全德的自由选举的建议，已经引起德国人民空前热烈的拥护，他们认为这个建议是真正解决德国全体人民的前途问题的方法。格罗提渥一一驳斥了波恩与西柏林政客所提出的对于这个建议的反对意见和反建议。他指出：这些反对意见和反建议的目的，是要缩小人民议会的建议在人民眼中的伟大意义和转移人民的注意力。格罗提渥指出：提出所谓柏林的统一可以促成德国的统一的说法是错误的，这是一种策略，它的目的是转移德国人民对于统一全德问题的注意。他着重指出：走向认真讨论统一德国的问题的第一步，就是召开全德会议。
    在回答记者所问国民议会应根据何种选举法来进行选举的问题时，格罗提渥和努舍克都指出：有许多不同的选举法可以采用，但是，在目前，最重要的问题不是选举法，而是召开全德会议以便讨论这个问题以及与此有关的问题。
    记者问道：如果联邦议会拒绝召开全德会议，德意志民主共和国政府和人民议会准备怎么办？格罗提渥答道：除了波恩议会的议员以外，还有千百万德国普通人民要求和平及德国的统一。因此，人民议会才向他们发出呼吁，要求他们支持它的建议，这并不是偶然的。德国人民将表示决心使全德会议得以召开，并大声疾呼要求尽早缔结对德和约。
