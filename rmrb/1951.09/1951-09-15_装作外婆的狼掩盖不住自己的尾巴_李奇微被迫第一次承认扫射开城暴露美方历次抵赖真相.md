Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Anyone who compares Ridgway's headquarters and the US chief representative Joye's partial admission of the US aircraft's strafing of Kaesong on September 10th with the US liaison officer's outright denial during the on-site investigation can draw the correct conclusion regarding the US side's denials of previous incidents of violating the Kaesong Neutral Zone.

When conducting an on-site investigation on the 10th, the US liaison officer, facing the irrefutable evidence of the US aircraft's strafing atrocities, still sought various excuses to carry out traditional American-style sophistry and denial. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Kaesong on the 10th: During the on-site investigation, the US investigation team, led by Liaison Officer Darrow, "used carpenter's rulers, protractors, dividers, and long ropes" "to determine the direction from which the bullets were fired and the angle at which they penetrated the house and hit the walls," and "climbed onto the roof to inspect the broken tiles and bullet marks." As a result, "United Nations investigators said the bullets appeared to have been fired from many directions and at different angles. They said this refuted the Communist claim that a plane flew over the conference site once during the so-called attack." Darrow then said to our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan: "All the evidence you pointed out can be placed here in many ways." Darrow also refused to admit that the bullets were fired from an aircraft, saying: "I have not received sufficient evidence." But when he could not deny the fact that the bullets were fired from an aircraft, he argued: "How do you know this aircraft is ours? Why can't it be yours?" When our liaison officer requested Darrow to continue the in-depth investigation, "Darrow said he was very satisfied with the evidence he already had, which was enough to 'lead us to appropriate conclusions.'" However, in the end, in order to avoid drawing conclusions on the irrefutable evidence, "Darrow told the Communists after the investigation that the evidence collected was not conclusive." Moreover, "Darrow and other United Nations investigators pointed out the following contradictions in the Communist evidence: First, almost all the bullets landed a few feet away from where they hit. Second, none of the bullets had the smell of gunpowder. Third, several bullets that hit the soft soil were also shattered. Fourth, the angle of fire judged from the location of the bullets showed a great difference in between." Therefore, the US investigation team led by Darrow "subsequently refused to believe that there was an air raid or United Nations aircraft involved in the attack."

Darrow, like Kenny, the US liaison officer who participated in the investigation of the US aircraft bombing of the Kaesong Neutral Zone on August 22nd and September 1st, stubbornly described the US aircraft's provocations as "fabricated" and "fictitious" by the Korean and Chinese side. Moreover, Darrow seemed to be acting even more convincingly than Kenny during the investigation. He was clearly acting in exactly the same way as the US liaison officers had done in the past, and he should have normally received the support of Ridgway and Joye. Darrow never dreamed that Ridgway and Joye would suddenly decide to use him as a scapegoat to prove their "honesty" in this and previous incidents.

People here cannot help but ask: If Ridgway, Joye, and their subordinates are honest people, why are they so contradictory? The wolf disguised as a grandmother cannot hide its tail after all. When Ridgway's headquarters and Joye hastily made partial admissions to this incident, they apparently forgot to notify their liaison officers in advance, let alone their reporters. Therefore, an Associated Press reporter complained in a telegram from Tokyo on the 12th: "Joye's response to Monday's (10th) strafing incident was unexpected. The liaison officer who investigated the strafing incident on Monday morning refused to admit that any attack had taken place, nor did he admit that any Allied aircraft were involved."

    李奇微被迫第一次承认扫射开城暴露美方历次抵赖真相
    【新华社十四日讯】任何人只要拿李奇微总部和美方首席代表乔埃对美机九月十日扫射开城事件的部分承认，和美方联络官在实地调查时的矢口抵赖相对照，他就可以对于美方对历次破坏开城中立区事件所作的抵赖得出正确的结论。
    美方联络官十日在进行实地调查时，面对着美机扫射暴行的确凿的人证物证，仍寻求各种借口进行传统的美国式的狡辩和抵赖。据美联社开城十日电：以联络官戴罗为首的美方调查人员，在进行实地调查时，曾“用木匠用的尺、分度规、分格规和长绳”，“来判断枪弹发射出来的方向，以及它们穿入屋子打进墙里的角度”，并且“爬上屋顶去查勘打碎的屋瓦和枪弹的痕迹”。结果，“联合国调查人员说，枪弹看来是从许多方面和不同角度发射的。他们说，这就驳倒了共产党的说法，他们说在这次所谓袭击时有飞机飞越会址一次。”戴罗于是向我方联络官张春山上校说：“你所指出的这些证据，全是能够用多种办法放在这里的证据。”戴罗并且拒绝承认子弹是从飞机上射下来的，他说：“我还没有得到充分的证据。”但是当他无法否认子弹是从飞机上射下来的事实时，他又争辩说：“你们怎能知道这架飞机是我们的呢？为什么不能是你们的呢？”当我方联络官要求戴罗继续深入调查时，“戴罗说，他已很满足于他已有的证据，这些证据已足以‘使我们得出适当的结论来’。”但是，最后为了逃避对确凿的证据做结论，“戴罗在调查完毕以后告诉共产党说：搜罗的证据不是确凿的。”而且，“戴罗和联合国其他调查人员指出共产党证据里面有下列几点矛盾的地方：第一，差不多所有的子弹都落在离打到的地方几呎远的地方。第二，没有一颗子弹有火药气味。第三，几颗打中软的泥土的子弹也都碰碎了。第四，从子弹所在地判断放枪的角度，表明这中间有很大的差别。”因此，以戴罗为首的美方调查人员“事后拒绝认为有空军袭击事件或联合国飞机参与袭击”。
    戴罗和参加调查八月二十二日及九月一日美机轰炸开城中立区事件的美方联络官肯尼一样，硬把美机的挑衅事件说成是朝中方面“捏造”和“虚构”的。而且戴罗在进行调查时，做作得似乎比肯尼还更像样些。他显然是按照美方联络官历次办事的方法一模一样地来行动的，并且他本来应当照例得到李奇微和乔埃的支持。戴罗作梦也没有想到，李奇微和乔埃突然决定要拿他做赎罪的羔羊来证明他们在这一次以及以往各次的“坦白”。
    人们在这里不能不发问：如果李奇微、乔埃和他们的下属都是诚实的人，为什么他们竟会如此自相矛盾呢？装作外婆的狼毕竟藏不好自己的尾巴。李奇微总部、乔埃在慌忙地对这次事件作部分承认时，显然事先忘记通知了他们的联络官，更忘记通知了他们的记者。因此美联社记者十二日从东京发出的电报埋怨说：“乔埃对本星期一（十日）扫射事件的答复，出人意料之外。星期一上午调查扫射事件的联络官拒绝承认有任何攻击事件发生，他也不承认有一架盟国飞机牵连在内。”
