At the mouth of the Xifei River in Fengtai County, northern Anhui Province, there is now a steel and concrete culvert gate project, preventing the backflow of the Xifei River and protecting the fields and villages on both sides of the Xifei River. This culvert gate project was only completed this spring. The construction of the culvert gate required solving many complex technical problems, but the person leading the construction was Shi Renzhu, a cadre who originally did not understand engineering technology. Shi Renzhu was originally the Deputy County Head of Funan County. He was transferred to Fengtai County in January of this year to lead the construction of the culvert gate project at the mouth of the Xifei River. He is the son of a middle peasant from Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, only studied for four or five years, joined the revolutionary work very early, is a Communist Party member, and has rich revolutionary struggle experience.

When Shi Renzhu arrived at the construction site, it was still a vast wilderness, with only a few engineers and students who had just graduated from school conducting design and exploration work. The engineering personnel believed that although Shi Renzhu had been tempered by a long period of revolution, he did not understand technology, so they did not discuss any issues with him. At the same time, Shi Renzhu also felt that he could not intervene in the work and requested the leading organs to transfer his work. However, the reply from the leading organs was: Communist Party members who cannot build must learn to build, and should strive to overcome difficulties when encountering them. At this time, he remembered what Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and we are being forced to do things we are not familiar with." "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things we do not understand." So, he resolutely returned to the construction site, determined to unite with technical personnel, learn professional technology, overcome difficulties, and complete the task.

However, uniting engineers and technical personnel was not smooth sailing. Some engineering personnel had a purely technical point of view and did not ask about matters other than technology; even the grass used to build the sheds was picked up by people picking grass nearby without anyone caring. More seriously, the financial system during construction was unsound, causing much waste. Shi Renzhu then began to solve these two problems. He united with the more progressive technical personnel, humbly asked them for advice, and listened to their opinions; he persuaded and appropriately criticized those who were backward and did not care about state property. He held a financial meeting with Zhu Qingyu, the engineer in charge of the workshop, and Lu Zhongfeng, the engineer from the construction company, to discuss and correct the phenomenon of waste. He made everyone realize that it is everyone's responsibility to cherish state property. After these two things, the technical personnel felt that Shi Renzhu could solve problems, and their attitude towards him changed, and they would consult with him when encountering problems.

In March, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries unfolded across the country. Shi Renzhu then helped the technical personnel to study politics. Some technical personnel initially did not care about politics, and some were emotionally disturbed because they did not understand the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. After studying and with Shi Renzhu's help, everyone made progress. This laid a solid foundation for the smooth progress of the project.

In early April, more than two thousand laborers had already excavated 39,000 cubic meters of earth for the gate foundation. At this time, Shi Renzhu encountered various complex technical problems. He then immersed himself in studying technology and lived on the construction site to observe in the field. He would ask engineers or technical personnel whenever he did not understand something. He often forgot to eat or stayed up late at night to study engineering problems with engineers. After such painstaking study, he gradually went from not understanding technology to initially understanding technology, and eventually mastered the technology. At first, he did not even recognize concrete, but now he has learned how to mix concrete. In this way, he was "in the know" about some issues on the project and did not feel too much difficulty in leading the work.

Shi Renzhu greatly respected the opinions of engineers. For example, for driving the gate foundation piles, the original plan was to drive 914 piles. Engineer Zhu Jiliang suggested that 600 piles would be enough, but other engineers disagreed and said, "The Huai River Management Committee has approved the driving of 914 piles, why bother looking for trouble." On this issue, Shi Renzhu carefully understood the situation and studied it in detail with the engineers. Finally, it was decided to conduct a pile driving test first. The test results proved that the local soil was relatively solid, and 600 piles would be enough. Shi Renzhu immediately decided to accept the suggestion of Engineer Zhu Jiliang and praised Engineer Zhu Jiliang. As a result, the pile driving time was reduced from the originally planned 60 days to 40 days. In this way, Shi Renzhu closely united the engineers and technical personnel, allowing them to fully发挥their enthusiasm, and at the same time learned the technology himself, completing the task of building this huge culvert gate project as scheduled.

The technical personnel who participated in this project all admired Shi Renzhu's spirit of learning and thanked Shi Renzhu for his political help. Zhu Jiliang, an old engineer in his sixties, said: "The facts have educated me, and I believe that in the past, the Communist Party led the people to achieve victory in the revolutionary regime. In the future, the Communist Party will also lead the people to achieve victory in construction."

    治淮干部史仁澍

    皖北凤台县西淝河口上，现在有一座钢骨水泥筑成的涵闸工程，防止着西淝河倒灌，保护着西淝河两岸的田野和农村。这一座涵闸工程是今年春天才修成的。修建涵闸要解决许多复杂的技术问题，但领导修建的却是一个原来不懂工程技术的干部史仁澍。史仁澍原是阜南县人民政府副县长，今年一月间才被调到凤台县领导修建西淝河口的涵闸工程。他是山西武乡县一个中农的儿子，只读过四五年书，参加革命工作很早，是一个共产党员，有丰富的革命斗争经验。
    史仁澍到达工地时，工地上还是一片空旷的原野，只有几个工程师和才从学校出来的学生在那里进行设计和钻探工作。工程人员们认为史仁澍虽然久经革命锻炼，但是不懂技术，因此，什么问题都不与他商量。同时，史仁澍也感到工作无法插手，请求领导机关调换他的工作。但是，领导机关的回答是：共产党员不会建设要学会建设，遇到困难应努力去克服。这时，他想起了毛主席在“论人民民主专政”里所说的话：“我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”于是，他坚决地回到了工地。下决心团结技术人员，学习业务技术，克服困难，完成任务。
    可是，团结工程师和技术人员，并不是一帆风顺的。部分工程人员存在着单纯技术观点，对技术以外的事情不闻不问；甚至搭工棚的草被附近拾草的人任意拾取也没有人管。更严重的是施工中财务制度不健全，造成许多浪费。史仁澍便着手来解决这两个问题。他团结进步较快的技术人员，虚心地向他们请教，听他们的意见；他说服并适当地批评了那些落后的不关心国家资财的人。他和负责工场的工程师朱庆玉和建筑公司工程师陆中风等召开了一个财务会议，讨论和纠正了浪费的现象。他使大家认识：爱护国家的资财是每一个人的责任。经过这两件事情以后，技术人员认为史仁澍能解决问题，对他的态度有了改变，遇有事情就找他商量了。
    三月间，镇压反革命运动在全国各地展开，史仁澍便帮助技术人员学习政治。有的技术人员开始不关心政治，有的因为不了解镇压反革命的政策，情绪不安。经过学习，经过史仁澍的帮助，大家都进步了。这对于工程的顺利进行打下了稳固的基础。
    四月初，二千多民工已经把三万九千公方土的闸基挖好了。这时，史仁澍接触到了各种复杂的技术问题，他便埋头学习技术，并住在工地上实地察看。凡是看不懂的他就向工程师或者技术人员请教。他常常为了与工程师研究工程问题忘记了吃饭，或者深夜不睡。经过这样苦心地钻研之后，他渐渐由不懂技术到初步懂得了技术，一直到掌握了技术。起初他连混凝土都不认识，现在他已学会了配合混凝土。这样，他对于工程上一些问题就“心中有数”了，在领导工作上就不感到太大的困难了。
    史仁澍非常尊重工程师的意见。例如打闸基桩，原计划打九百一十四根，工程师朱纪良建议打六百根就够了，但是别的工程师不同意，并说：“治淮委员会已批准打九百一十四根，何必多找麻烦。”对这个问题，史仁澍仔细了解了情况后并和工程师们详细研究。最后决定先进行打桩试验。试验的结果证明，当地土质较为坚实，打六百根桩就可以了。史仁澍立刻就决定接受朱纪良工程师的建议，并对朱纪良工程师加以表扬。结果打桩的时间由原计划的六十天减少成了四十天。就这样，史仁澍紧密地团结了工程师和技术人员，使他们充分地发挥了积极性，同时自己也学会了技术，如期完成了修建这座巨大涵闸工程的任务。
    参加这个工程的技术人员，对于史仁澍的学习精神都很钦佩；并且感谢史仁澍在政治上对他们的帮助。六十多岁的老工程师朱纪良说：“事实教育了我，我相信：过去共产党领导人民取得了革命政权上的胜利，今后共产党也将领导人民取得建设上的胜利。”
