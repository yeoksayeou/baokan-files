    University Engineering Department Students Should Study Discussions on Design and Construction
    After the People's Daily published the editorial "Construction is Impossible Without Correct Engineering Design" and related articles, it has aroused enthusiastic discussions among comrades in the engineering and construction field. In order to ensure that the people's property will not be lost due to blind construction in the future, I believe that students in all universities and colleges related to engineering construction should study this important issue in order to obtain more practical knowledge and better serve the people in the future.

    Xinxiang Business Department of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company
    Should Cherish National Resources
    The Xinxiang Business Department of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has piled up a large number of mine pit sleepers in a very low-lying area at the south end of Xinxiang Railway Station. A few days ago, after continuous heavy rains, all these sleepers were submerged in mud and water. At that time, the department did not take any measures to move the sleepers that were soaked in the water. After the water receded, no drying was carried out. Now, more than a hundred stacks of sleepers have been immersed in shallow water and mud for more than two months and have begun to rot. However, the department still ignores it.
    We believe that this attitude of not cherishing national resources is wrong. It is recommended that the department quickly salvage this batch of submerged timber and earnestly examine their thinking.

    Shanxi County Anliangpu Village Cadre Liu Jianxi
    Cherish the People's Railway
    Liu Jianxi, a village cadre in Anliangpu Village, Fifth District, Shanxi County, Chahar Province, has always cherished the people's railway. He often leads militiamen along the line at night to patrol and prevent sabotage by special agents. Therefore, no accidents have occurred in the section of the railway within the jurisdiction of Anliangpu Village.
    Recently, Comrade Liu Jianxi mobilized the residents of Anliangpu Village to contribute a total of 262 kilograms of railway equipment (including locomotive parts, rail spikes, flatcar axles, fishplate bolts, etc.), which were transported by five farmers from the village, Wang Shouxiang, Ni Bingqing, Wang Riheng, and Hao Shengxi, using handcarts to the Daiyue Railway Station Public Security Substation for transfer to the Daiyue Engineering Section Materials Factory for inventory. After receiving these materials, the Daiyue Engineering Section expressed its gratitude to Comrade Liu Jianxi and the local people for their actions of loving the people's railway and has reported to the higher authorities for commendation.

    Correctly Understand the Meaning of "Students' Main Task is to Study"
    and "Health First"
    After seeing the State Council's "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools," we deeply realized that improving students' health is indeed an important condition for ensuring that students complete their study tasks. We believe that the youth of New China should correctly understand and grasp the principles of "Health First" and "Students' Main Task is to Study," and establish correct learning viewpoints ideologically. If we understand the meaning of learning or the "Health First" principle one-sidedly, it will set learning and health against each other, resulting in the adverse consequences of not being able to study well or not paying attention to health.
    Therefore, when formulating the Patriotic Pact, we have included "Establishing a Comprehensive Learning Viewpoint" in the Patriotic Pact so that we can better serve the people in the future.

    Newspapers are Delivered Quickly Between Beijing and Shanba
    Shanba in Suixi is 720 li away from Baotou, and it takes a charcoal truck at least three days to get there. The train from Baotou to Beijing takes another day and a night. Therefore, it takes at least four days and one night to get from Beijing to Shanba. The work efficiency of the people's postal organs is truly amazing. Our people in Shanba can now see the People's Daily from four days ago. Everyone feels very excited and happy. When reading the newspaper, comrades said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, everything is progressing. The newspaper, post office, and transportation departments can indeed deliver the People's Daily to us in the shortest possible time in our ideals!"

    Xingtai Special District People's Hospital Should Establish a Duty System
    I went to the Xingtai Special District People's Hospital for treatment at 4:00 pm on August 18th (Saturday). When I went to register, the comrade at the registration office said: "The hospital is having a meeting today and will not see patients." I asked him why there wasn't even a doctor on duty? Whether they don't see patients every Saturday afternoon? He didn't give a definite answer. At that time, I happened to see a Patriotic Pact posted on the wall of the hospital, which stipulated "Prompt diagnosis and treatment so that patients can recover their health as soon as possible." I believe that the hospital's failure to leave a doctor on duty during the meeting is very inconvenient for people seeking medical treatment and does not comply with the Patriotic Pact they have signed. I hope the hospital will improve this situation.

    高等学校工程院系同学应学习关于
    设计施工的讨论
    人民日报发表了“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”的社论和有关这方面的文章后，已经引起工程建设界同志们的热烈讨论。为了保证人民的财产今后不因盲目施工而受损失，我认为：全国各院校有关工程建设的同学，都应该对这一重要问题进行学习，以获得更多的实际知识，将来更好地为人民服务。

    应该爱护国家资材
    中国煤业建筑器材公司新乡营业部，在新乡车站南头很洼的地方，堆放了大批矿坑垫木。前些日子连下大雨，这些垫木全被淹在泥水里。当时，该部并没有设法将泡在水中的垫木移开。水退以后，仍没有进行翻晒。现在有百余垛垫木已在浅水和泥浆里浸了两个多月，并开始腐朽。但是该部仍不过问。
    我们认为这种不爱护国家资财的态度是错误的。建议该部赶快抢救这批被淹的木材，并认真检查自己的思想。

    山阴县安良铺村干部刘建西
    爱护人民铁路
    察哈尔省山阴县五区安良铺村村干部刘建西一贯爱护人民铁路，经常在黑夜带领民兵沿线查巡，防范特务分子破坏。因此，在安良铺村管界内的一段铁路，从未发生任何事故。
    最近，刘建西同志又动员安良铺村的居民，献交铁路器材共计二百六十二公斤（其中有机车零件、道钉、平车车轴、鱼尾螺丝等），并由本村的农民王守祥、倪炳清、王日恒、郝生秀等五人用手车推着送到岱岳车站公安分所，转送岱岳工务段材料厂点收。岱岳工务段接到这些器材后，对刘建西同志和当地人民热爱人民铁路的行动表示非常感谢，已呈报上级请予表扬。

    正确认识“学生主要任务是学习”
    及“健康第一”的意义
    看到政务院“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”后，我们深深体会到：增进学生健康确是保证学生完成学习任务的重要条件。我们认为，新中国的青年应该正确地理解并掌握“健康第一”与“学生主要任务是学习”的原则，在思想上树立起正确的学习观点。如果片面地了解学习的意义或“健康第一”原则，就会把学习和健康对立起来，造成不能很好学习，或者不能注意健康的不良后果。
    因此，在订立爱国公约时，我们已经把“建立起全面的学习观点”这一项订入爱国公约内，使我们将来能够更好地为人民服务。

    北京到陕坝间的报纸邮递迅速
    绥西的陕坝，离包头七百二十华里，木炭汽车最快要走三天。从包头到北京的火车，又需一天一夜。因此，从北京到陕坝，最快也得走四天一夜。人民的邮政机关工作效率真是惊人。我们陕坝人民现在已经可以看到四天前的人民日报。大家都感到非常兴奋、愉快。同志们在看报的时候说：“在毛主席共产党的领导下，一切都在进步着。报社、邮局及交通运输方面，能够确实将人民日报在我们理想的最短时期内，送到我们的手里了！”

    邢台专区人民医院应建立值班制度
    我在八月十八日（星期六）下午四时到邢台专区人民医院去治病。我去挂号时，挂号处的同志说：“今天院里开会，不看病。”我问他为什么连个值班医生也没有？是否每星期六下午都不看病？他也没作肯定答覆。当时，我正好看见该院墙上贴着一张爱国公约，上面订有“诊治迅速，使病人早日恢复健康”一条。我认为：该院开会不留值班医生，对看病的人很不方便，也不合于他们所订的爱国公约，希望该院改善这种情况。
