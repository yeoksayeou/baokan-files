    About the Indictment and Punishment of War Criminals
    Report by Shen Junru at the Fifth Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers
    【Xinhua News Agency】Shen Junru, head of the Chinese delegation attending the Fifth Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, delivered a report to the congress on the 6th entitled "About the Indictment and Punishment of War Criminals." The full text is as follows:

    (I) Chairman, dear friends:
    Today, I feel honored and excited to be able to attend this congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and to discuss the important issue of "How Law Should Serve Peace and Democracy" with representatives of outstanding democratic legal workers from around the world. Especially today, when world peace is facing a crisis and democratic rights are being undermined in capitalist countries, our gathering and our discussions are of particular significance.

    I have been assigned to report to you on the topic of the indictment and punishment of war criminals. As a representative from China, I particularly feel the importance of this issue, because China is a country that has suffered the deepest and longest aggression. The pain and damage inflicted on the Chinese people by the imperialist war criminals are inestimable.

    Leaving aside the distant past, taking only the eight-year war of Japanese aggression against China, starting with the invasion of Northeast China in 1931, especially from 1937 onward, the loss of life suffered by the Chinese military and civilians exceeded ten million, and the property loss was valued at over 50 billion US dollars. In the one and a half months of the Japanese occupation of Nanjing in the winter of 1947, our Nanjing residents (mostly the elderly, women, and children) who were massacred by Japanese war criminals exceeded 230,000. Tens of thousands of Nanjing women (including old women, pregnant women, and young girls) were raped and killed after being raped.

    I am only giving one example here. These facts are all supported by true evidence, and they are facts that have been confirmed without doubt by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

    Due to bloody experience and bloody lessons, the Chinese people deeply hate the crimes of war criminals, whether they are old war criminals or new war criminals, Japanese war criminals or American war criminals.

    From this point of view, it is not difficult to understand why the movements against the arming of Japan, to defend world peace, and to resist the US and aid Korea have grown and strengthened vigorously in China, and have gained the enthusiastic support of the entire people.

    The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never allow any war criminals to invade our territory and trample on our compatriots again!

    (II)

    In a gathering of jurists, I do not intend to give a detailed presentation or discussion of the definition of "war criminal" or the concept of "war crime" in the history of international law. That is not necessary.

    As everyone knows, before the Second World War, in traditional international law, although the terms "war criminal" or "war crime" were not commonly used, many behaviors (such as maltreatment of prisoners of war, killing or injuring civilians, looting private property, harming sick and wounded enemy prisoners, using poison gas or other prohibited weapons, etc.) were listed as prohibited.

    These war criminals were generally referred to as "Class B war criminals" in the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East – that is, war criminals who violated the laws and customs of war.

    However, the laws and customs of war cannot encompass all atrocities arising from war. What they stipulate is only limited to illegal acts by the belligerent parties against hostile countries during the period of combat, and the occurrence of the acts is limited to the combat area. As for other kinds of atrocities, even larger in scale, more inhumane, and more cruel atrocities (such as the Nazi regime's massacre of millions of Jews in Germany and Jews in Poland), these were not expressly stipulated in the Hague Rules or the Geneva Conventions; nor were they covered by any international practice or any domestic military law or criminal law.

    After the Second World War, a "crime against humanity" was added in the trial of war criminals.

    This is a noteworthy development in the concept of "war crime."

    But the concept of "war crime" has a more noteworthy development after the Second World War, which is the addition of a "crime against peace," that is, recognizing aggressive war as a crime under international law. According to Article 6 of the Nuremberg Tribunal Statute, "crimes against peace" refer to "planning, preparing, initiating, or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements, or guarantees, or participating in a common plan or conspiracy to accomplish any of the foregoing." The provisions of the Statute of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East are generally the same. This "crime against peace" is listed as a "Class A war crime" in both tribunal statutes, and our usual concept also considers it to be the most serious type of war crime. As the Nuremberg judgment stated: aggressive war is the greatest crime, because it contains and produces many, many crimes; it is a collection of multiple crimes. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East fully agreed with this conclusion.

    This conclusion has become a powerful principle in international law.

    Therefore, I believe that defining "aggressive war as an international crime" can be regarded as the greatest contribution of the people to international law after the Second World War, and it also represents a major development in the concept of war criminals in international law. This development is undoubtedly beneficial to defending world peace.

    (III)

    I do not intend to dwell on the situation of the trials of war criminals after the end of the Second World War.

    What I want to emphasize here is that the American imperialists are using war criminals to prepare for new wars!

    As everyone knows, since the end of the Second World War, the Axis countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan have collapsed, the imperialist countries such as Britain and France have weakened, and the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has grown. Especially after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the strength of this camp has been further enhanced and consolidated. Therefore, in recent years, what the American imperialists, Wall Street monopoly capitalists, and their employed politicians and military personnel have been diligently and tirelessly dedicated to is actively preparing for a new world war in order to attack the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia. The Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, Acheson's Total Diplomacy, MacArthur's Pacific Front, Eisenhower's European Army, the separate US-UK peace treaty with Japan, etc... all have this as their central purpose! This is the "global strategic plan" boasted by the American imperialists.

    In this so-called American "global strategic plan," the most important two parts are arming West Germany in Europe and arming Japan in the Far East. In the eyes of the American imperialists, these are the two indispensable pillars in their arrogant plan to conquer the world!

    In order to arm West Germany and Japan, and drive the German and Japanese people to the battlefield again as American cannon fodder, the United States has been conniving at and shielding German and Japanese war criminals since shortly after the end of the war, especially after 1949. It not only released the unindicted war criminals on the grounds of "insufficient evidence, no prosecution," but also acquitted or leniently sentenced the war criminals who had been tried in the past, and also released batches of war criminals who had been solemnly sentenced and were serving their sentences from prison. According to recent news, many of these war criminals are being treated as honored guests and will be holding important positions in the American-German and Japanese mercenary armies.

    (IV)

    I do not know much about the situation of the United States and some of the countries that follow it in Europe shielding and conniving at Nazi war criminals. In the past two years or more, I have seen reports about the release of war criminals in newspapers at least once a month, and these reports have become more and more frequent recently, and the number of people released has also become larger and larger. What strikes me most is the release of German armaments king Krupp on January 31 this year. He was released on the same day by the West German US military authorities, together with General Speidel, the commander-in-chief of the Hitler-occupied Greek forces, and 21 other important Nazi war criminals. It is reported that his property rights worth 500 million US dollars have been restored, the "Bonn Parliament" has also decided to give him a loan, and he will once again serve as the boss of that huge company built on human heads and ashes. Secondly, I also noticed five Nazi war criminals who colluded with the Japanese in China in the past: Frank Sapega, Hans Niemen, Oswalt Urlicht, Herbert Müller, and Flick Wodenberg. They were German officials and spies stationed in Beijing and Guangzhou during the Japanese invasion of China. Although their positions were not high, many Chinese people are familiar with their names. They were released by the commander-in-chief of the US Army in Europe in Frankfurt on June 21 last year. Finally, I can also mention a released Nazi war criminal whose name is well known to every household in China, that is, General Falkenhausen. He served as the head of the Nazi German military advisory group to the Chiang Kai-shek government for a very long time, and was a powerful assistant to Chiang in the heinous war against the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. During Hitler's occupation of Belgium, he was the Nazi governor of Belgium. After Germany surrendered, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison by a Belgian court. However, due to the instigation of the United States, the Belgian government unconditionally freed him on March 28 this year. According to Belgian newspaper reports, this Nazi general has recently received two invitations from Chiang Kai-shek, asking him to go to Taiwan to take on the dirty work of opposing the Chinese people for him and his American masters.

    The above are just a few examples that I have paid particular attention to. I know that hundreds and thousands of Nazi war criminals have been released directly or indirectly by the United States. If this crime of the United States is not stopped, we can easily imagine that in the near future, these war criminals will not only be released completely by the United States, but will also hold various positions in the "European Army" and "North Atlantic Treaty Army" manipulated by the United States. This is undoubtedly a major insult to the European people; it is bound to arouse the universal anger of the European people. No wonder that on the seventh day (February 6) after Krupp and others were released, a protest demonstration was held in the Danish capital with the participation of 15,000 people.

    (V)

    I know more about the situation of the American imperialists shielding and conniving at Japanese war criminals in the Far East. But time does not allow me to give a detailed account. Here, I will only briefly mention a few major events:

    1.  As early as the autumn of 1947, the US occupation authorities released a group of 23 major Japanese financial magnates and arms manufacturers (the Krupps of Japan), including financial giants Yoshisuke Aikawa, Chikuhei Nakajima, and Fusanosuke Kuhara. These people colluded with the warlords and played a huge role in the Japanese war of aggression; they were originally all scheduled to be prosecuted as "Class A war criminals." But in order to use them, the United States released them all without reason.

    2.  At the end of 1948, the United States released all of the remaining 19 Class A war criminals in detention who were awaiting trial. Among them were Toshizo Nishio (former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army), Kisaburo Ando (former Commander-in-Chief of the South China Expeditionary Army), Kazuo Aoki (former Minister of Greater East Asia, Director of the Planning Board), and Eiji Amau (former President of the Japanese Information Bureau, the protagonist of the Amau Doctrine). These people were all notorious chief culprits, who were originally going to be prosecuted at the same time as the 28 people, including Tojo, who were tried in the first batch by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. It was only because the court's facilities were insufficient that it was decided to list them as the second batch to be tried. However, within a few days after the execution of the first batch of verdicts by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, MacArthur unilaterally released them all with a "no prosecution." At this point, the trial of Japanese Class A war criminals was unilaterally declared concluded by MacArthur, and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East was dissolved by MacArthur from then on. This absurd behavior of MacArthur represents the contempt of the United States for the Allied countries and the insult to the dignity of the law!

    3.  The American imperialists shielded Emperor Hirohito and other bacteriological war criminals. Hirohito not only participated in all the Japanese wars of aggression, but was also the highest responsible person for these wars, and should have been prosecuted as a Class A war criminal from the beginning. However, due to the obstruction of the United States, the Far Eastern Commission has never been able to decide to hand him over for trial. In February 1950, the Soviet Union discovered in the trial of Japanese bacteriological war criminals in Khabarovsk that Hirohito and Shiro Ishii and others had committed serious crimes in preparing for and engaging in bacteriological warfare. Therefore, the Soviet Union notified the countries concerned and proposed the establishment of a special international military tribunal to try Hirohito, Ishii, and others. The People's Republic of China fully agreed with the Soviet proposal. However, this completely legal and reasonable proposal was rejected by the United States unreasonably and brutally! Now Hirohito is not only not handed over for trial, but is still perched on the heads of the Japanese people, and Ishii and others are also at large. It is said that they are still being employed by the United States to manufacture new killing bacteria for the United States. The Chinese people feel particularly indignant at the United States' crime of sheltering bacteriological war criminals, because we have countless evidence proving that the Japanese bacteriological factory set up near Harbin had arrested a large number of our compatriots as experimental subjects, causing more than 3,000 deaths; in 1940 and 1941, Japan repeatedly spread plague and other bacteria in the Central China region, Ningbo, and Changde, causing heavy deaths among our people. One family of twelve were all infected and died; on the eve of the liberation of the Northeast, when the Japanese army destroyed its bacteriological factory in order to eliminate traces, bacteria spread in all directions, causing a major epidemic, and 23,171 nearby residents died from the epidemic. The Chinese people will never forget the crimes of these bacteriological war criminals, Hirohito and Ishii!

    4.  The United States not only released all the large and small war criminals who had not yet been prosecuted on the grounds of "insufficient evidence" (these war criminals were released cleanly in the summer of 1949), but it also released many war criminals who had been sentenced and were serving their sentences from prison. Some of these war criminals were transferred to the Allied headquarters for custody after being sentenced by the Allied countries, and some were sentenced after international joint trials. In order to preserve the Japanese fascist reactionary forces and pave the way for the revival of Japanese militarism, the United States released them batch after batch. In the winter of 1949, MacArthur released more than 100 people on the pretext of "good behavior." On March 7, 1950, MacArthur went even further and issued his notorious "Directive No. 5." The purpose of the directive was undoubtedly to enable all Japanese war criminals who had been sentenced (including Class-A war criminals who were solemnly sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, organized by eleven Allied countries) to be released in batches. The procedures and conditions stipulated in the directive are just a smokescreen. In total, as of the end of July this year, as many as 309 Japanese war criminals have been released successively in accordance with this directive, including former Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru, who had been sentenced to imprisonment by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. The Soviet government protested to the United States twice, on May 11 and August 25, 1950, against MacArthur's illegal Directive No. 5. Our Foreign Minister Zhou also issued a stern statement on May 15, 1950, condemning this absurd behavior of the United States, but the United States went its own way and completely ignored these protests and statements. According to the separate US-UK "peace treaty with Japan" drafted by the United States and currently being signed in San Francisco, the Japanese government is illegally granted the right to release war criminals. Even the chief war criminals who have been sentenced by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East can be arbitrarily released as long as the Japanese government obtains the consent of the so-called majority of the countries participating in the trial. Such war criminal clauses are completely destructive and violate international agreements, and their absurdity and perversity are unprecedented!

    Due to the shielding and connivance of the United States, it is not difficult for us to imagine that in the near future, all Japanese war criminals will be released. Not only will they be released, but they will also hold positions in the "US-Japan Joint Military Committee" and the Japanese "Defense Force" hired by the United States, which will be established under the US-Japan military agreement, just as those released Nazi war criminals will hold positions in the "European Army" and "North Atlantic Treaty Army" hired by the United States.

    This behavior of the United States, which violates international agreements, is a major insult to the people of the Allied countries and the Japanese people, and it is also a serious threat to world peace! (To be continued)

    关于战争罪犯的检举和惩罚
    沈钧儒在国际民主法律工作者协会第五届代表大会上的报告
    【新华社讯】出席国际民主法律工作者协会第五届代表大会的中国代表团团长沈钧儒，于六日向大会作了题为“关于战争罪犯的检举和惩罚”的报告，全文如下：（一）主席、亲爱的朋友们：
    今天我能够出席国际民主法律工作者协会的本届代表大会，与世界各国杰出的民主法学工作者的代表来共同讨论“法律应如何为和平与民主服务”的这个重大问题，我感觉荣幸和兴奋。尤其是在世界和平正遭遇危机和资本主义国家内民主权利正被摧残的今天，我们的集会和我们的讨论更有特别的意义。
    我被指定向各位作报告的题目是：战争罪犯的检举和惩罚。作为一个来自中国的代表，我特别感觉这个问题的重要性，因为中国是一个受侵略最深、最久的国家。帝国主义战犯们所加于中国人民的痛苦和损害，是无法估计的。
    远的且不说，仅以自一九三一年日本侵略中国的东北，特别是自一九三七年起日本侵略中国的历时八年的战争来说，中国军民遭受的生命损失便是一千万人以上，财产损失价值超过美金五百亿元。一九四七年冬在南京被日军占领的一个半月里，我们的南京居民（大都是老年人、妇女和儿童）被日本战犯们屠杀掉的便是二十三万以上。南京妇女（包括老妇、孕妇、幼女）被奸和奸后被杀的，数以万计。
    这里我不过举一个例子而已。这些事实都有真凭实据，而且是经远东国际军事法庭确认无疑的事实。
    由于血的经验，血的教训，中国人民对于战犯们的罪行是深恶痛绝的。不论他们是旧的战犯或新的战犯，日本的战犯或美国的战犯。
    本此观点，人们不难了解：为什么反对武装日本，保卫世界和平，以及抗美援朝的运动在中国会蓬蓬勃勃地生长和壮大，获得全体人民的热烈拥护和支持。
    已经站起来了的中国人民，决不容许任何战犯再去侵略我们的领土，蹂躏我们的同胞！（二）
    在一个法学家的集会里，我不打算对于“战犯”的定义或“战罪”的概念在国际法历史上的演变作详细的陈述或讨论。那是不必要的。
    正如大家所知道的：在第二次世界大战之前在传统的国际法里，“战犯”或“战罪”的名词虽不习用，但是有许多行为（例如虐待俘虏，杀伤平民，抢劫私人财物，残害伤病敌俘，使用毒气或其他禁用的武器等等）就被列为禁条的。
    这种战犯在纽伦堡国际军事法庭和远东国际军事法庭里，概称为“乙级战犯”——即违反交战法规或惯例之战争罪犯。
    但是交战法规或惯例并不能包括一切由战争而产生的暴行。它们所规定的只是限于交战双方在战斗期中对敌对国家的违法行为，而且行为的发生只是限于作战地域。至于其他种种的暴行，甚至更大规模，更违背人道，更残酷的暴行（例如纳粹政权对于德国自己国内犹太人和波兰境内犹太人数以百万计的大屠杀），那是无论在海牙规则或日内瓦公约都不曾明文规定；同时也是任何国际惯例或任何国内军法或刑法所未涉及的。
    在第二次世界大战以后，在战犯审判里便增加了一种“违反人道之罪”。
    这是“战罪”概念的一个值得注意的发展。
    但是“战罪”概念在第二次世界大战以后有更值得注意的发展，是增加了一种“违反和平之罪”，亦即确认侵略战争为国际法上的犯罪。依照纽伦堡法庭规章第六条所规定：“违反和平之罪”是指“计划，准备，发动或执行一种侵略战争，或一种违反国际条约，协定或保证之战争，或参加为完成上述任何一种战争之共同计划或阴谋”。远东国际军事法庭规章的规定，与此大体相同。这种“违反和平之罪”在两个法庭规章里都列为“甲级战罪”，而我们通常的观念也认为这是战争犯罪中最严重的一种。正如纽伦堡判决书上所说：侵略战争是最大犯罪，因为它里面包含着并产生着许许多多的犯罪；它是多种犯罪的集合体。远东国际军事法庭完全同意了这个论断。
    这个论断已经成为国际法上一个有力的原则。
    因此，我认为确定“侵略战争为国际罪行”可算是第二次世界大战后人民对国际法的最大贡献，也代表着国际法上的战犯概念的一个重大发展。这个发展无疑地对于保卫世界和平是有利的。（三）
    关于第二次世界大战终结后审判战犯的情形，我不打算多所论列。
    我在这里，要强调指出的只是：美帝国主义者正在利用战犯准备进行新的战争！
    大家都知道：自第二次世界大战结束以后，德意日轴心国家崩溃了，英法等帝国主义削弱了，而以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量壮大了，尤其是在中华人民共和国成立之后，这个阵营的力量，是更加增强和巩固了。所以，近数年来，美帝国主义者，华尔街独占资本家及其所雇佣的政客们军人们所专心致力，孜孜不息的，便是要积极准备新的世界大战，以打击苏联、中华人民共和国以及欧亚二洲的人民民主国家。杜鲁门主义，马歇尔计划，北大西洋公约，艾奇逊的总体外交，麦克阿瑟的太平洋战线，艾森豪威尔的欧洲军，美英的单独对日和约，等等……都是以此为其中心目的！这便是美帝国主义所夸耀的“全球性的战略计划”。
    在这个所谓美国的“全球性的战略计划”里，最重要的两部分是在欧洲武装西德和在远东武装日本。在美帝国主义者眼光里这是他们征服世界狂妄计划中最不可缺少的两大支柱！
    为了要武装西德和日本，驱使德国人民和日本人民为它重上战场充当美国炮灰，美国自战争结束不久，尤其是在一九四九年以后，一直都在纵容着包庇着德国战犯和日本战犯。它不但把未起诉的战犯们以“证据不足，不予起诉”而开释了，不但把已往付审的战犯们宣告无罪或从轻发落了，而且把已经郑重判了刑且正在执行中的战犯们都一批一批地从监狱里释放出来。据最近的消息：这些战犯们中有许多正在受着上宾的待遇，将在美国的德日雇佣军队里担任重要的职务。（四）
    关于美国和它的一些追随它的国家在欧洲包庇纵容纳粹战犯的情形，我知道的不太多。在过去两年多以来，我在新闻纸上几乎每个月都可以看到一次以上关于释放战犯的报道，而这种报道最近更是愈来愈多，被释放的人数也愈来愈大。最使我注意的是今年一月三十一日被释放的德国军火大王克虏伯。他是和希特勒驻希腊占领军总司令斯派达尔将军及其他二十一名重要纳粹战犯同一天由西德美军当局释放的。据悉：他的价值五亿美元的财产权已被恢复，“波恩议会”还决定给他一笔贷款，而且他还将再度出任那个建筑在人头与尸灰上面的巨大公司的老板。其次我还注意到的，是以前在中国和日本人勾结的五名纳粹战犯，佛兰克·萨培格、汉斯·聂门、渥斯瓦特·乌耳立克脱、赫勃脱·缪莱、佛立克·渥登培格。他们是日军侵华时期的德国派驻北京和广州等地的官员和间谍，地位虽不高，但许多中国人对他们的名字却很熟悉。他们是去年六月二十一日被美国驻欧军总司令在法兰克福释放的。最后，我还可以提到一个被释放的纳粹战犯，它的名字在中国是家喻户晓，人人皆知的，那便是法肯豪森将军。他担任过纳粹德国驻蒋介石政府军事顾问团团长而且时期很长，在反对中国人民革命运动的罪恶战争中是蒋的一个得力帮手。在希特勒占领比利时时期，他是纳粹驻比利时的总督。德国投降后，他被比利时法庭判处了十二年徒刑。但是由于美国的教唆，比利时政府已经在今年三月二十八日把他无条件地释放了。据比利时新闻纸的报道：这位纳粹将军最近已经接到蒋介石两次的邀请，要他到台湾去担任他和他的美国主子的反对中国人民的卑污工作。
    以上不过是我个人特别注意到的几个例子而已。我知道：成百成千的纳粹战犯已经被美国直接或间接地释放了。倘使美国的这种罪行不加制止，我们不难想像：在最近的将来，这些战犯不但会被美国释放殆尽，而且会在美国操纵下的“欧洲军”和“北大西洋公约军”里担任各色各样的职位。这无疑的是对欧洲人民的重大侮辱；必然会引起欧洲人民的普遍愤怒。无怪乎在克虏伯等被放后的第七天（二月六日），丹麦京城便举行一个有一万五千人参加的抗议示威游行。
    （五）
    关于美帝国主义者在远东包庇和纵容日本战犯的情形，我知道的比较清楚。但是时间不允许我作详尽的陈述。在这里，我只简单地提出比较重大的几件事：
    一、远在一九四七年秋天，美国占领军当局便把一批日本主要财阀和军火制造商（日本的克虏伯们）共二十三人，包括财阀巨头鲇川义介、中岛知久平、久原房之助全部释放了，这些人与军阀勾结，在日本侵略战争中起过巨大作用；他们原都是决定要以“甲级战犯”起诉的。但是美国为了要利用他们，毫无理由地便把他们都释放了。
    二、一九四八年底，美国把所剩下的，在羁押中的，唯一的一批尚待审判的甲级战犯，共十九名，全部释放了。其中有西尾寿造（前日本中国派遣军总司令）、安藤纪三郎（前华南派遣军总司令）、青木一男（前大东亚相，企划院长）、天羽英二（前日本情报局总裁，天羽声明的主角），这些人都是恶迹昭彰的元凶巨憝，原本是要和远东国际军事法庭第一批审讯的东条等二十八名同时起诉的。只因法庭的设备不够，才决定把他们列为第二批受审。但是在远东国际军事法庭对第一批判决执行不到几天的工夫，麦克阿瑟便把他们全部以“不起诉”而擅自释放了。至此，日本甲级战犯审判便被麦克阿瑟独断地宣告完结，而远东国际军事法庭也就从此无形地被麦克阿瑟解散了。麦克阿瑟的这种荒谬行为，代表着美国对同盟国家的蔑视和对法律尊严的侮辱！
    三、美帝国主义者包庇日皇裕仁及其他细菌战犯。裕仁不但参加了日本一切的侵略战争，并且是这些战争的最高责任者，自始便应该以甲级战犯起诉。但是由于美国的阻挠，远东委员会始终没有能够决定把他交付审判。一九五○年二月，苏联在伯力审判日本细菌战犯中发现了裕仁和石井四郎等人都犯有准备和从事于细菌战争的重大罪行。于是苏联便照会了有关各国，提议组织特别国际军事法庭，对裕仁、石井等人加以审判。中华人民共和国是完全同意苏联的提议的。但这个完全合法合理的提议，竟遭到美国横蛮无理的拒绝！现在裕仁不但不交付审判，而且仍旧是高踞在日本人民的头上，而石井等人亦都逍遥法外，据说还正被美国雇佣着在替美国制造新的杀人细菌。中国人民对美国这个庇护细菌战犯的罪行特别感觉愤慨，因为我们有无数的证据证明着：日本在哈尔滨附近设立的细菌工厂里，曾大量逮捕我国同胞去做试验品，造成了三千人以上的死亡；在一九四○年和一九四一年，日本曾在华中区，宁波和常德一带多次散布鼠疫及其他细菌，使我国人民死亡惨重，有一家十二口全遭传染而死；在东北解放前夕，日军为了灭迹而破坏其细菌工厂时，细菌四面散布酿成大疫，附近居民染疫而死者达二万三千一百七十一人之多。中国人民对于裕仁、石井这些细菌战犯的罪行，是永远不会忘记的！
    四、美国不但以“罪证不足”释放了全部尚未起诉的大小战犯（这些战犯在一九四九年夏天便释放干净了），它并且把许多已经判决了罪刑而且正在服役的战犯们也从监狱里释放了出来。这些战犯其中有些是同盟国判刑后移送盟军总部看管的，有些是经过国际会审才判决的。为了保全日本法西斯反动势力和为日本军国主义的复活铺平道路，美国把他们一批又一批地释放了。在一九四九年冬天麦克阿瑟便以“行为良好”为藉口，释放了一百多名。一九五○年三月七日，麦克阿瑟更变本加厉，布颁了他那臭名远扬的“第五号指令”。指令的目的无疑地是在使一切已经判决了的日本战犯（包括经十一个同盟国组织的远东国际军事法庭所郑重判决的甲级战犯）能够全部分批获得释放。指令中所规定的手续和条件，不过是烟幕而已。综计迄今年七月底为止，依照这个指令而先后获得释放的日本战犯已达三百零九人之多，其中且有曾经远东国际军事法庭判处徒刑的日本前外相重光葵在内。对于麦克阿瑟这个非法的第五号指令，苏联政府曾于一九五○年五月十一日和八月二十五日两度向美国提出抗议，我国周外长也曾于一九五○年五月十五日发表斥责美国这个荒谬行为的严正的声明，但是美国一意孤行，对这些抗议和声明完全没有理会。依照美国起草的，刻正在旧金山签字的美英单独“对日和约”，非法地给予日本政府释放战犯的权利。连远东国际军事法庭已经判刑的首要战犯，也只要日本政府征得参加审判国家所谓多数的同意，便可以任意释放。这样的战犯条款是完全破坏和违反国际协定的，它的荒谬乖张是史无前例的！
    由于美国的包庇纵容，我们不难想见：在不久的将来，日本战犯全部都会被释放出来。不但会被释放出来，而且他们还会在行将在美日军事协定下成立的“美日联合军事委员会”和美国雇佣的日本“国防军”里担任职务，就如那些被释的纳粹战犯会在美国雇佣的“欧洲军”和“北大西洋公约军”里担任职务一样。
    美国这样的破坏国际协议的行为是对同盟国家人民以及日本人民的重大侮辱，同时也是对世界和平的严重威胁！（未完）
