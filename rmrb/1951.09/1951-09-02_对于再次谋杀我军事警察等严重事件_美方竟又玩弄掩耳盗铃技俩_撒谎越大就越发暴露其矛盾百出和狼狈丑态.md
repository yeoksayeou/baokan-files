(Xinhua News Agency, 1st) Regarding the serious incident of the US-Li army invading the Kaesong neutral zone on August 30 and killing our military police, as well as the incident of a US plane dropping flares over the Kaesong negotiation site at 2:40 AM on August 29, the US side is once again playing the trick of burying their head in the sand and making excuses through lies. The United Nations Command in Tokyo issued a statement today saying that the "United Nations forces" were "not involved" in these two incidents. What is the basis for this "non-involvement"? Of course, it is not the result of an investigation at the scene of the incident, but the US side's own so-called "investigation." According to the statement, "After the Eighth Army Commander ordered an investigation into the alleged intrusion into the neutral zone, the preliminary investigation report indicated that friendly forces were at a considerable distance from the area and would not have caused the alleged incident."

"The investigation also stated that United Nations forces outpost teams were never within 4,000 yards of Panmunjom." It is absurd for the US side to attempt to shirk its responsibility for its troops invading Tantong-ri in the Kaesong neutral zone and killing two of our military police with this as a reason. Any liar can fabricate such an "investigation" at his desk; he doesn't even need to look at a map. But the fact is ruthless. The fact is that the US-Li army attacked our three military police, killing two of them, and then retreated to the US-Li army position under our pursuit. Zheng Zhongnan, our military policeman who escaped from the US-Li army attack, fully proved this, and nearby residents also proved it. This is something the US side cannot deny no matter how hard it tries. The US side's despicable and shameless behavior also lies in its malicious slander, attempting to shift the responsibility for this crime to our side. The US statement said: "The investigation indicated that there was an enemy mortar about one mile northwest of Pengjili (transliteration) Hill, and twelve mortar shells were found to have fallen directly west of Pengjili around noon on August 30." The implication is that the martyrs Zhang and Yang may have been killed by our side shooting into the neutral zone. This malicious and stupid rumor by the US side will never deceive fair world opinion.

Regarding the incident of a US plane dropping flares over the Kaesong negotiation site on August 29, the US statement said: "Another investigation by the Fifth Air Force into the alleged dropping of flares over Kaesong on August 29 indicated that the flares were dropped at approximately 3:40 AM that day, but the locations where they were dropped were Nanchuan-dong, twenty miles north of Kaesong, and Hechang-ri (transliteration), twenty-five miles north of Kaesong. The investigation report said that the aerial photography flares exploded with a loud noise, and the light could be seen from far away. Visibility over the Kaesong-Sariwon area was good at the time of the alleged incident." The American liar thought that this fabrication was very clever, but he backfired and revealed his true colors. The fact is that American planes dropped flares over Kaesong, not twenty or twenty-five miles north of Kaesong. The American liar dared not say that American planes did not drop flares that night, and dared not admit dropping flares over Kaesong, so he lied and said that he had dropped flares north of Kaesong, but he dared not say that he was too close to Kaesong, so he said it was more than twenty miles away. In this way, the US side seems to be able to say plausibly that the flares seen by the people of Kaesong were dropped more than twenty miles away. However, anyone with a little common sense knows that people can never see the light of flares twenty to twenty-five miles away. Thus, one of the two must be true: either the American plane dropped the wrong flares, mistaking Kaesong for some "Nanchuan-dong" or "Hechang-ri"; or the American plane did drop flares over Kaesong. It is impossible to drop the wrong thing, because the statement said that "visibility over the Kaesong-Sariwon area was good" at the time, so there can only be one result, that is, the American plane did drop flares over Kaesong.

No matter how hard the US side tries to lie, it cannot cover up its crimes with conclusive evidence. The bigger the lie the US side tells, the more it exposes its contradictions and embarrassing appearance. It is absolutely impossible for the United Nations Command to cover up the sun with a piece of paper.

    对于再次谋杀我军事警察等严重事件
    美方竟又玩弄掩耳盗铃技俩
    撒谎越大就越发暴露其矛盾百出和狼狈丑态
   【新华社一日讯】对于美李军队八月三十日侵入开城中立区并杀害我方军事警察的严重事件，以及美机于八月二十九日二时四十分在开城谈判会址上空投下照明弹事件，美国方面又一次玩弄掩耳盗铃的技俩，撒谎狡赖。在东京的联合国军司令部今日发表一项声明，说“联合国部队”与这两次事件“并无牵涉”。这种“并无牵涉”的根据是什么呢？当然不是肇事地点的调查结果，而是美方自己的所谓
    “调查”。据该声明说，“第八军军长下令调查所说的侵犯中立区事件以后，初步调查报告指明，友军离该区均有相当距离，并不致引起所说的事件。”
    “调查并说明联合国军，前哨队伍任何时候距离板门店都没有在四千码以内。”美方企图以此为理由，推脱其部队侵入开城中立区内炭洞里并杀害我方两名军事警察，实在是太荒唐了。任何一位说谎者都可以在自己的写字台上杜撰这样的“调查”的，他甚至连地图也无须看一看。但是事实是铁面无情的。事实明明是美李部队袭击我方三名军事警察，并杀害了其中两人，然后在我方追击下退回美李军阵地。从美李军袭击下逃脱的我方军事警察郑重男完全证明了这点，附近的居民也证明这点。这是美方无论如何抵赖不了的。美方的卑鄙无耻还在于它含血喷人，竟图将此次罪行的责任转嫁我方。美方的声明说：“调查指明：在距离彭基里（译音）西北约一英里的山头附近有一门敌人的迫击炮，八月三十日近午时分发现有十二发迫击炮弹落在彭基里正西。”意思就是说张、杨两烈士可能是我方向中立区射击打死的。美方这种恶毒而愚蠢的造谣是决不能欺骗全世界公正舆论的。
    关于美机八月二十九日在开城谈判会址上空投掷照明弹事件，美方声明说：“第五航空队对于八月二十九日的所谓在开城投掷照明弹事件进行的另外一个调查指明：照明弹是那一天上午约三时四十分投掷的，但是投掷的地点是在开城以北二十英里的南川店与开城以北二十五英里的何昌里（译音）。调查报告说，空中摄影用的照明弹爆炸时闹音很大，很远都可以看见光亮。在他们所说的事件发生的时候，开城——沙里院区域上空的能见度是很好的。”美国的说谎者自以为这样的杜撰很巧妙，但是他却弄巧反拙，露出马脚来了。事实是美国飞机在开城投掷照明弹，而不是在开城以北二十英里或二十五英里。美国说谎者不敢说美机在那天夜里没有投照明弹，又不敢承认在开城投照明弹，于是撒谎说曾在开城以北投照明弹，但又不敢说得离开城太近，所以就说在二十英里以外。这样一来，美方似乎可以振振有词地说，开城的人看见的照明弹是在二十英里以外投掷的。但是，稍有常识的人都会知道，人们绝不能看见二十至二十五英里以外的照明弹的光亮的。这样，二者必居其一：或者是美机投掷错了，把开城当作是什么“南川店”或“何昌里”了；或者是美机确实在开城投掷照明弹。投掷错是不可能的，因为声明中说当时“开城——沙里院区域上空能见度是很好的”，因此结果只能有一个，就是美机确实在开城投掷了照明弹。
    不论如何挖空心思地撒谎，美方总不能掩盖其证据确凿的罪行，美方撒谎越撒得大，就越发暴露其矛盾百出和狼狈丑态。联合国军司令部企图以一纸声明遮住太阳是万万不行的。
