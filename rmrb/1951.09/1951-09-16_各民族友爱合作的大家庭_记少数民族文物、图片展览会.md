    A Great Family of Friendship and Cooperation Among All Nationalities
    ——On the Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Pictures of Minority Nationalities
    Bai Sheng
    The Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Pictures of Minority Nationalities, organized by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, opened on the 10th of this month in the Forbidden City. This exhibition portrays the new, free, and happy life built by all nationalities in the spirit of equality, mutual assistance, and unity, based on the Common Program's ethnic policies.
    From the photographs displayed in the Zhonghe Hall, we see the close relationship between the various minority nationalities and the People's Government since the founding of New China. The frequent visits of representatives of various nationalities to Beijing, and the visits of the Central Nationalities Visiting Delegations to the minority areas in the Northwest, Southwest, and Central South, fully demonstrate the great unity of all nationalities. The photographs also record the Central People's Government's implementation of ethnic policies, the practice of ethnic regional autonomy in minority areas, and the establishment of ethnic democratic united governments in areas where various ethnic groups live together. Ethnic autonomous regions such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, and the Dongxiang Autonomous Region of Gansu Province have been established successively throughout the country. United governments have also been established in Xichang Prefecture in Xikang Province, Pu'er Prefecture in Yunnan Province, and other places, enabling the people of all ethnic groups to be their own masters. From the photographs, we also saw the signing of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet in Beijing, once again demonstrating the great victory of Mao Zedong's ethnic policy.
    In the center of the Zhonghe Hall, many exquisite costumes of minority nationalities are displayed; most of these costumes were presented to Chairman Mao by the people of various ethnic groups. From here, we can see the characteristics of the lives of various minority nationalities. In the open space between Zhonghe Hall and Baohe Hall, a real Mongolian yurt is set up. It is built with willow wood and wrapped in thick felt. Opening the two small doors, you can see a stove in the middle, a chest facing the door, and cushions on both sides of the stove, where the nomadic Mongolian people sit, rest, and sleep. This Mongolian yurt can accommodate a small Mongolian family. There is also a Tibetan cloth tent with exquisite blue and white patterns. This is used by the Tibetan people for traveling or gatherings. Every spring and autumn, the Tibetan people set up such tents in scenic grasslands or willow groves for outings, banquets, and various song and dance or religious ceremonies.
    Among the exhibits displayed in the Baohe Hall, a prominent part is the vivid models reflecting the living conditions of several minority nationalities after liberation. In a model of life in a Mongolian nomadic area, we see that due to the Inner Mongolia People's Government's implementation of the "prosperity of both people and livestock" policy, the economic life of the Mongolian people has been significantly improved, and the sanitary environment has also changed. There are clean Mongolian yurts on the grasslands, and lively babies are breastfed in their mothers' arms. The happy Mongolian people are working hard to build this beautiful land. In a model depicting the Tibetan people's active production after liberation, we see on the roof of a house Tibetans busy beating qing稞, women milking cows and churning butter in front of the door, transport teams supporting the front line passing by on the road, and herders' tents and flocks of sheep at the foot of the mountain... In front of the main hall is a model depicting the happy life of the Uygur people in Xinjiang after liberation. Farmers are busy cultivating the fields, and large Hami melons are full of melon fields; the elderly are telling children stories of the People's Liberation Army's battles under grape trellises; a woman is weaving carpets, and housewives are baking naan on their unique naan stoves; women are busy picking apples in the vegetable garden; an elderly Ahong is happily riding a horse to participate in the people's representative conference. This free and happy life is something they have never had before. There is also a model that illustrates how the Yi people in the Greater Liang Mountains of Xikang established their own political power under the leadership of the Communist Party. The People's Government helped them create a new Yi script. Young men and women are working in the fields, and everyone gathers together during rest to enthusiastically learn the new script. At the same time, because the People's Government implemented a correct trade policy, their wool and other products were sold well, and the lives of the Yi people have also improved. Another model depicts the happy life of the Miao people in the Qingshui River area of eastern Guizhou after liberation. To celebrate their liberation and harvest, young Miao people joyfully beat bronze drums and play lusheng in front of the village.
    Many colorful photographs displayed in the exhibition also depict the happy lives of people of all nationalities after liberation.
    Of particular note in the exhibition are the various weapons used by the minority nationalities to defend themselves and fight against invaders. From these weapons, we see the brave spirit of the minority nationalities. During the Chinese People's War of Liberation, the minority nationalities used these simple weapons to fight alongside the People's Liberation Army against the Kuomintang bandits, achieving great victories. Among the weapons on display is a musket that the Tibetan people used fifty years ago to resist the British imperialist invasion. This gun was specially brought from Tibet by Bainqen Erdini and presented to Chairman Mao, representing the Tibetan people's determination to resist imperialist aggression.
    In addition, from the many minority nationalities' production tools, daily necessities, handicrafts, and musical instruments on display, we can also see their diligence and wisdom. In the many local products from minority areas on display, we can see that since liberation, governments at all levels have correctly implemented trade policies in minority areas, promoting local products and supplying necessities, which has significantly improved the lives of the people of all nationalities. The many brocade banners presented to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government by the minority nationalities also demonstrate the love of the various minority nationalities for their people's leader and their own government.
    Visiting this exhibition deepens our understanding of the various minority nationalities, and also makes us feel the warmth of the national family!

    各民族友爱合作的大家庭
    ——记少数民族文物、图片展览会
    柏生
    中央人民政府民族事务委员会举办的少数民族文物、图片展览会，已经于本月十日在故宫开幕了。这个展览会写出了各民族在共同纲领民族政策的基础上，以平等互助和团结的精神，共同建立起来的自由幸福的新生活。
    从中和殿所陈列的照片上，我们看到新中国成立以后，各少数民族与人民政府的亲密关系。各民族代表的纷纷来京，中央民族访问团的分别赴西北、西南、中南各少数民族地区进行访问，都充分表现了各族人民大团结的情形。照片上也记载了中央人民政府为推行民族政策，在少数民族聚居地区实行民族的区域自治，在各族杂居地区建立民族民主联合政府的情形。全国各地已先后成立了内蒙古自治区、西康省藏族自治区及甘肃省东乡自治区等各民族自治区，并在西康省西昌专区、云南省普洱专区等地先后建立了联合政府，使各族人民自己当家作了主人。从照片上，我们也看到了和平解放西藏的协议在北京签订的情形，又一次表现了毛泽东民族政策的巨大胜利。
    中和殿的中央，陈列了许多少数民族的精致服装；这些服装大部是各族人民献给毛主席的。从这里，我们可以看到各少数民族生活的特点。在中和殿与保和殿之间的空场上，布置着一座真实的蒙古包。它是用柳木搭起的，外面用厚毡子包起来。打开两扇小门进去，你可以看到中间是一个火炉，对着门的是箱子，火炉两边有坐垫，游牧的蒙古人民就在垫子上起坐睡眠。这个蒙古包可以容纳一户蒙族的小家庭。另外还布置着一个有着蓝白色精致的图案花纹的藏族布帐棚。这是藏族人民旅行或集会时用的。每当春秋的季节，西藏人民就在风景优美的草原上或柳林中，搭起这种帐棚郊游，宴会，并举行各种歌舞或宗教仪式。
    在保和殿所陈列的展览品中，比较突出的一部分是反映解放后几个少数民族生活情形的生动的模型。在一个蒙古游牧区生活的模型里，我们看到了由于内蒙古人民政府推行了“人畜两旺”的政策，蒙古人民经济生活显著地提高了，卫生环境也改变了。草原上有了清洁的蒙古包，活泼的婴儿在母亲的怀里哺乳。愉快的蒙古人民正在努力建设着这一片美好的土地。在描述解放后藏族人民积极生产的一个模型里，我们看到一座屋顶上，藏民们正在忙着打青稞，门前有妇女挤牛奶、打酥油，大路上过着支援前线的运输队，山坡下有牧民的帐房和羊群……。大殿的正前方有描绘解放后新疆维吾尔族人民幸福生活情形的模型。农民们正在忙着耕田，肥大的哈密瓜结满在瓜地上；老年人在葡萄架底下给孩子们讲述人民解放军的战斗故事；一个妇女在织地毡，主妇正在他们特有的馕炕上烤馕；菜园内妇女们正忙着摘苹果；年老的阿訇愉快地骑着马去参加各界人民代表会议。这种自由幸福的生活是他们从来所没有的。这里还有一幅模型，它说明了西康大凉山上的彝民在共产党的领导下，建立起自己政权的情形。人民政府帮助他们创造了新彝文。年青的男女正在田里工作，休息时大家围拢在一起热烈地学习着新文字。同时因为人民政府实行了正确的贸易政策，使他们的羊毛等生产品也得到了畅销，因而彝民们的生活也改善了。另一幅模型描述了解放后贵州东部清水江一带的苗民幸福生活的情景。为了欢庆自己的翻身和丰收，苗族青年们在寨前欢乐地敲铜鼓、吹芦笙。
    展览会中陈列的许多五彩照片，也写出了各族人民在解放后的幸福生活。
    在展览中引人注目的，是各少数民族用来自卫和向侵略者作斗争的各种武器。从这些武器上我们看到了少数民族人民的勇敢精神。在中国人民解放战争中，少数民族人民曾使用这些简单的武器，配合人民解放军向国民党匪军进行战斗，获得了很大的胜利。在展览的武器中有一支火枪，五十年前西藏人民曾用它来抵抗了英帝国主义的侵略。这支枪是班禅额尔德尼先生特地从西藏带来献给毛主席的，它表示藏族人民抵抗帝国主义侵略的决心。
    此外，从展览的许多少数民族的生产工具、日用品、手工艺品和乐器中，我们也可以看到他们的勤劳和智慧。在陈列的许多少数民族地区的土产中，我们可以看到解放以来各级人民政府在少数民族地区正确地贯彻了贸易政策，推销土产，供应了必需品，使各族人民的生活有了显著的改善。少数民族献给毛主席、中央人民政府的许多锦旗，也表现了各少数民族对于人民领袖与自己政府的爱戴。
    参观了这个展览会，使我们加深了对各少数民族的了解，同时也使我们感到了民族大家庭的温暖！
