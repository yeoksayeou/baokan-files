    People's Government Leads Farmers in Patriotic Production Increase to Overcome Disasters
    National Grain Output to Exceed Last Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] In the vast areas of North China and inside and outside the Great Wall, the autumn crops have begun to be harvested, and the autumn harvest has been widely launched throughout the country. Although many areas have suffered from droughts and insect pests this year, the harvest in most parts of the country is still better than last year, and the total national grain output will exceed last year.
    The rice harvest in the Yangtze River Basin and areas south of the Yangtze River is generally good this year. In Sichuan, it is generally 80-90% of the harvest, and the intermediate rice in Zhejiang is generally 10-20% higher than last year. The intermediate rice in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is also better than last year, except for individual areas with severe summer drought. Hubei yields about 350 jin per mu. The harvest of autumn crops such as sorghum, millet, corn, and beans is also good. The Huai River Basin is having a bumper harvest. The average annual harvest in the entire Northeast region is above 80%. The sorghum and millet in Henan, Shandong, Pingyuan, and Hebei provinces are yielding about 200 jin per mu, except for a few disaster-stricken areas, with good yields reaching 300-400 jin. On a national scale, except for some areas in Inner Mongolia, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces and regions that have been severely affected by disasters and have harvests that are not as good as last year, the harvests in other provinces and regions have exceeded last year.
    This year, the autumn crops in most parts of the country have suffered severe natural disasters. The temperature and rainfall are far less uniform than last year, and insect pests have been very serious in some areas. Therefore, the total grain output this year cannot reach the planned target. However, the total grain output this year has still increased, exceeding last year. This increase in production is entirely due to the victory won by farmers across the country in carrying out the patriotic production increase movement under the leadership of the People's Government. Over the past year, under the leadership and support of the People's Government, farmers across the country have built water conservancy projects, planted improved varieties, increased the application of fertilizers, improved farming methods, and strived for a bumper harvest. Disaster-stricken areas have fought against drought and eliminated pests, striving for a better harvest. This is the basic reason for this year's increase in production.
    Now that the autumn harvest has begun, farmers across the country are paying close attention to protecting the autumn harvest and preventing possible disasters such as wind and frost, in order to protect the production achievements of the past year.

    人民政府领导农民爱国增产战胜灾害
    全国粮食产量将超过去年
    【新华社二十三日讯】华北广大地区和长城内外都已开镰收割大秋作物，秋收已在全国广泛展开。今年不少地区虽有旱、虫等灾害，但全国大部地区的收成仍然比去年好，全国的粮食总产量将超过去年。
    长江流域和长江以南地区的水稻，今年的收成一般是好的，四川地区一般是八、九成，浙江的中稻普遍比去年增加一成到二成，湖南、湖北、江西的中稻，除个别夏旱较重的地区外，也比去年好，湖北每亩收三百五十斤左右。高粱、谷子、玉蜀黍、豆类等秋作物的收获也不错，淮河流域是丰收，东北全区的平均年成在八成以上，河南、山东、平原、河北等省的高粱和谷子，除少数受灾地区以外，每亩收获都在二百斤左右，好的达三、四百斤。就全国范围来说，除了内蒙古、察哈尔、绥远、河北、陕西、山西等省区中各有一部分地区受灾较重，收成不如去年以外，其他省区的收成都是超过去年的。
    今年全国大部地区秋作物所受到的自然灾害很重，气温和雨量远不如去年那样调匀，好些地区虫害很严重，因此今年的粮食总产量不能达到预定的目标。但是，今年的粮食总产量还是增加了，超过了去年。这个增产，完全是全国农民在人民政府领导下开展爱国增产运动争取得来的胜利。一年来，全国农民在人民政府的领导和扶持下，兴修水利，播植良种，增施肥料，改进耕作，奋力争取丰收；受灾地区抗旱除虫，奋力战胜灾害，争取较好的收成。这是今年增产的基本原因。
    现在，秋收已经开始，为保卫一年来的生产成果，全国农民都很注意护秋和防止可能的风霜等灾害。
