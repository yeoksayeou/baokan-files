    Guarantee the Implementation of the Marriage Law
    The Case of Child Bride Abuse and Murder in Cangshan, Shandong, Has Been Judged
    The case of the young woman Ms. Pan from Yangjiazhuang, District One, Cangshan County, Linyi Prefecture, Shandong Province, who was abused and murdered, has been thoroughly investigated and judged.
    Ms. Pan, a twenty-one-year-old young woman from Yangjiazhuang, District One, Cangshan County, was originally from Sunjiatun Village, District Fourteen, in the same county. Her parents died early, and she had no brothers, so she was sent to Yangjiazhuang to be the child bride of Qi Shoude (also known as Qi Yu) when she was seven years old. Since entering the Qi family, she not only ate pig slop, but also did all the work of an adult, such as grinding, cooking, collecting firewood, and going to the lake. She was also often beaten and scolded. Qi Songshi, Qi Shoude's mother, was a rogue who, after her husband's death, had a relationship with village cadre Guo Yushan for seven years and had three illegitimate children, two of whom had been killed. They both disliked Ms. Pan and, in addition to Qi Songshi's cruel abuse, Guo Yushan often threatened Ms. Pan as her father-in-law, saying, "It doesn't matter if you kill three or two people like you." Ms. Pan, feeling helpless, fled to her uncle Qi Kairong's home in Shimen Village, Yuxi District, Donghai County, last February and stayed there for more than eight months. After returning to her husband's family, Qi Yu, his mother, and Guo Yushan abused her even more severely. Seeing no way to survive, Ms. Pan gathered her courage and went to the district government in the second month of the lunar calendar this year to request a divorce. The district government referred her to the township for processing. Fearing that she would be beaten to death if she returned to her husband's family, she was introduced by Township Chief Song to stay temporarily at her cousin Gao Hongduo's home in Shawopu Village. Later, she repeatedly submitted divorce requests to the district and village three times. The district government sent letters to Village Chief Liang Fuming and Party Branch Secretary Chen Yongmao four times in a row, urging them to urge Qi Shoude to come to the district to process the divorce quickly, but they claimed that "Qi Shoude was not at home." Guo Yushan even threatened Qi Shoude, saying, "As long as you don't go, you won't be able to get a divorce." This played a decisive role in encouraging Qi Shoude, his mother, and Guo Yushan to brutally harm Ms. Pan. On the first day of the third month of the lunar calendar, Ms. Pan was tricked back to her husband's home by her cousin Pan Jingzhang. On the tenth day of the third month, Guo Yushan discussed a plan to secretly murder Ms. Pan with Qi Shoude in the south garden and ordered Qi Shoude to find a rope. That night, Ms. Pan was severely beaten with a stick by Qi Shoude in the mill, and then the three criminals tied Ms. Pan up. Guo pulled her to the beam and used double-stranded steel bars to beat Ms. Pan's buttocks and genitals, leaving her body covered with bruises. In extreme pain, Ms. Pan repeatedly pleaded with Guo Yushan, saying, "Dear brother, please have mercy on me!" But the inhumane Guo Yushan not only refused to listen but also used an iron awl to stab her heart twice with Qi Songshi, and then even inserted an iron bar into her vagina. Ms. Pan cried out in agony, "Dear father, you can beat me until my skin is torn and rotten, but please don't kick me like this!" But Guo replied:
    "Didn't you want a divorce? I'll give you a taste of it this time! Let's see if you still run away!" They beat her from seven o'clock in the evening until the second half of the night. Ms. Pan finally died tragically under torture. Although her cries were heard by the neighbors, they dared not go to rescue her because they were intimidated by Guo's ferocity.
    After Ms. Pan's tragic death, Guo ordered Qi Songshi to fabricate the news that Ms. Pan had died of illness in an attempt to cover up their crime, while Qi Yu fled in fear of punishment. However, the truth was obvious to everyone. On the second day of Ms. Pan's murder, the district government discovered the case and solved it. After Qi Yu fled to his uncle Qi Kairong's home in Shimen Village, Donghai County, he was reported and sent back by Qi Kairong. At this point, the three murderers were all arrested.
    After the Pan case was published in the Shandong Dazhong Daily (the materials were very incomplete at the time), it aroused great anger among people from all walks of life in the province. The Shandong Provincial Women's Federation issued an indictment on behalf of women throughout the province, demanding severe punishment for the murderers. The Shandong Provincial People's Government Supervision Committee also sent a letter to the Cangshan People's Government, ordering it to handle the matter quickly. Women's federations and readers from Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Changwei, and Yantai in Shandong Province also sent letters to Dazhong Daily and Rural Dazhong Daily, demanding that these criminals be punished quickly.
    After months of in-depth investigation, it was found that the organization of Yangjiazhuang Village was seriously impure. Since liberation in 1945, four of the five Party members, led by the village branch secretary Chen Yongmao (who has been expelled from the Party), had been sheltering landlords. Village Chief Liang Fuming, Party Branch Secretary Chen Yongmao, and village cadre Guo Yushan continued to serve the bandits when the Chiang bandits occupied the area in 1947. Although Chen Yongmao and Liang Fuming were tenants, they were bought by the landlords. The landlords pretended to sell land and gave Liang Fuming 28 mu of land and Chen Yongmao 47 mu of land. During the review in 1948, the masses rose up and struggled against the landlords, but they were suppressed by the village cadres. At the same time, they systematically organized the wife of Liu Zongfan, the head of the Shengxian Dao (also the head of the Shengxian Dao), and the wife of Cao Jilun, the head of the traitor, to be the chairwoman of the women's association, and Qi Shoude (Ms. Pan's husband) to be the head of the Communist Youth League, controlling village politics and oppressing the masses. During the land reform this time, they tried every means to obstruct it, secretly organizing and luring the masses, not approaching our cadres, and surrounding the cadres, following them wherever they went, making it impossible for the cadres to approach the masses. They not only did not question the abuse of Ms. Pan by Guo Yushan, Qi Songshi, and Qi Shoude but even approved of it. On the second day of Ms. Pan's tragic death, when the district chief went to the village to examine the body and investigate the cause and circumstances of Ms. Pan's tragic death, they claimed, "Who knows how she died?" In fact, the villagers heard the cries of Ms. Pan's tragic death. The two criminals not only failed to report to the higher authorities in time after Ms. Pan was killed but also tried every means to cover up the crimes for the murderers, threatening the masses to block the news and preventing the government from understanding the case early, capturing the murderers, and bringing them to justice. Precisely because the village organization is impure,
    all policies cannot meet the masses, especially the Marriage Law has not been implemented, resulting in serious feudal ideas among the masses, and even skepticism about the Marriage Law.
    After several months of investigation by the Linyi Branch of the Shandong Provincial People's Court, it was found that the main criminals Guo Yushan, Qi Songshi, and Qi Shoude had consistently abused Ms. Pan and then, under the instigation of Guo Yushan, conspired with Qi Songshi and Qi Shoude to murder her. Their cruelty and viciousness were appalling. In order to implement the Marriage Law, vigorously combat feudal forces, and support the women's liberation movement, it was approved to sentence Guo Yushan and Qi Songshi to death. Qi Shoude committed murder under the instigation of Guo Yushan and was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Chen Yongmao and Liang Fuming have always sheltered landlords, sabotaged land reform, and become local bullies who oppress the masses. Regarding Ms. Pan's divorce issue, they supported Qi Shoude, allowing him to fail to report to the district four times in a row, directly fueling the ferocity of Qi Songshi and his son. After Ms. Pan's death, they tried to cover up the crimes for the murderers. Pan Jingzhang, Ms. Pan's cousin, had previously been a traitor and usually did not sympathize with Ms. Pan's tragic situation but instead blamed her in every possible way. After Ms. Pan raised a legitimate request for divorce due to the abuse of the Qi family, he beat and scolded her and ordered his wife to forcibly send Ms. Pan back to the Qi family, causing Ms. Pan to suffer a tragic death. This criminal should also bear certain criminal responsibility. It was decided to sentence Chen Yongmao to five years of imprisonment, and Liang Fuming and Pan Jingzhang to three years of imprisonment each.
    The East China Branch of the Supreme People's Court approved the above judgments on August 7. In view of the fact that this case is a typical event of violating the Marriage Law, preventing women's liberation, and thus killing women, it has ordered the Linyi Branch to convene a mass rally in the place where the crime was committed to announce the judgments after receiving the approval order and to further carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work to educate the masses and benefit the implementation of the Marriage Law.

    保障婚姻法的贯彻
    山东苍山虐杀童养媳案已判决
    山东省临沂专区苍山县一区杨家庄青年妇女潘氏被虐杀案件，业经彻查并予判决。
    苍山县一区杨家庄二十一岁的青年妇女潘氏，娘家是同县十四区孙家屯村人。因父母早死，又无兄弟，七岁时便被送到杨家庄给齐守德（即齐玉）当了童养媳。自从进了齐家后，不但吃的像猪食，就是推磨、烧饭、拾柴、下湖什么活也顶个大人干，还经常挨打受骂。齐守德的母亲齐宋氏是个二流子，在丈夫死后，和村干部郭玉山发生关系，已有七年，先后生过三个私生子，其中两个已被治死。她俩嫌潘氏碍眼，除由齐宋氏对其施行残酷的虐待外，郭玉山更经常以公公的身份，威吓潘氏说：“像你这样的人，打死三个两个不要紧。”潘氏被逼得没有办法，去年二月曾逃到东海县羽西区石门村她叔公齐开荣家里住了八个多月。回婆家后，齐玉母子和郭玉山对其虐待更甚。潘氏眼看没有活路，在今年农历二月十四，硬了硬头皮到区政府请求离婚，当由区介绍到乡办理，她本人怕回婆家被打死，便由宋乡长介绍到沙窝村她表姑高洪铎家暂住。后又连续向区、村提出离婚请求三次，区政府曾连续四次派人送信与该村长梁富明、支部书记陈永茂，要他们转催齐守德赶快来区办理，但他们却推说：“齐守德不在家”。郭玉山更威胁齐守德说：“只要你不去，离婚就离不成。”这对助长齐守德母子及郭玉山惨害潘氏起了决定作用。在农历三月一日，潘氏被其娘家的四服堂兄潘敬璋骗回婆家后，三月十日郭玉山便在南园里同齐守德商议暗害潘氏计划，并令齐守德找好绳子。当天晚上潘氏便被齐守德在磨道里用棍子痛打，然后又由该三犯把潘氏捆起，由郭犯拉到梁头上，用双股钢条将潘氏打得臀上、阴部紫青乱点，遍体鳞伤。潘氏痛极，曾连续哀求郭玉山说：“亲大哥讲讲情饶了我吧！”而灭绝人性的郭玉山非但不听，又和齐宋氏用铁锥子狠狠的在她心口里戳了两下，后竟以铁条穿入她的阴道。潘氏惨痛的呼喊道：“亲爹，任凭你打得皮开肉烂，别这样踢蹬我吧！”而郭犯却说：
    “你不是要离婚吗？这次叫你过过瘾！看你还跑不跑！”这样从晚上七点，一直打到下半夜，潘氏终于在非刑下悲惨的死去，虽然哀号之声闻于四邻，但邻居因慑于郭犯的凶威，不敢前往抢救。
    潘氏惨死后，郭犯要齐宋氏制造潘氏病死的消息，企图掩盖其罪行，齐玉则畏罪潜逃。但是众目昭彰，在潘氏被害的第二日便被区政府发觉破案，齐玉在逃到东海县石门村叔父齐开荣家后，即被齐开荣检举送回，至此，三个凶手遂一一就逮。
    潘氏案件在山东大众日报公布后（当时材料很不完全），引起全省各界人民极大的愤怒。山东省妇联为此事曾代表全省妇女提出控诉，要求严办杀人凶犯；山东省人民政府监察委员会亦亲自致函苍山人民政府责成迅速处理；山东济南、青岛、徐州、昌潍、烟台各地妇联及广大读者亦纷纷致函大众日报、农村大众报，要求赶快惩办这些罪犯。
    经过月来深入调查后，发现杨家庄村的组织存在着严重不纯的现象。该村自一九四五年解放后，以村支部书记为首的陈永茂（已被开除党籍）等五个党员就有四个包庇地主，村长梁富明、支部书记陈永茂、村干部郭玉山在一九四七年蒋匪占据该地时，仍替蒋匪服务。陈永茂、梁富明虽系佃户，但都被地主收买，地主伪装买卖土地，先后送给梁富明地二十八亩，陈永茂地四十七亩。在一九四八年复查时，群众起来和地主斗争，当被村干部压制下去；同时，他们更有计划地组织了圣贤道头子刘宗范之妻（亦系圣贤道头子）与汉奸头子曹纪伦的老婆任妇女会长，齐守德（潘氏丈夫）任青年团长，把持村政欺压群众。这次土地改革时，他们更百般加以阻挠，一面暗地里组织拉拢群众，不和我干部接近，一面包围干部，干部走到那里，就分头跟到那里，使干部无法和群众接近。对郭玉山、齐宋氏、齐守德三犯对潘氏虐待，他们非但不加过问，反而予以赞同；在潘氏惨死后的第二天，区长去该村验尸调查潘氏惨死的原因和情况时，他们又推说：“谁知怎样死的？”其实潘氏惨死时号叫之声，村人都听到。该二犯在潘氏被害后，不但未及时报告上级，还想尽一切办法为凶犯掩饰罪恶，并威胁群众封锁消息，阻碍政府不能及早了解案情、捕获凶犯，归案严办。正因为村的组织不纯，
    一切政策就不能和群众见面，特别是对婚姻法未予贯彻执行，致群众存在着严重的封建思想，甚至对婚姻法抱着怀疑态度。
    经过山东省人民法院临沂分院数月调查，认为该案主犯郭玉山、齐宋氏、齐守德一贯凌虐潘氏，后进而由郭玉山主谋，齐宋氏、齐守德参与谋杀，其残酷毒辣，实属骇人听闻，为了贯彻婚姻法，有力的打击封建势力，支持妇女解放运动，乃批准将郭玉山、齐宋氏处以死刑，齐守德在郭玉山怂恿下杀人犯罪，判处有期徒刑十五年，陈永茂、梁富明一贯包庇地主，破坏土地改革，成为欺压群众的恶霸，而对潘氏离婚问题，更支持齐守德，使他先后四次能不到区投案，直接助长了齐宋氏母子的凶焰，而潘氏死后更多方为凶犯掩饰罪行，潘氏四服堂兄潘敬璋，以前当过汉奸，平时对潘氏悲惨遭遇既不予以同情，反而百般加以责难，在潘氏因不堪齐家虐待提出正当离婚要求后，又施以打骂，并令其妻子将潘氏强行送回齐家，致使潘氏遭受惨害，该犯亦应负一定的罪责，决定处陈永茂有期徒刑五年，梁富明、潘敬璋各判以有期徒刑三年。
    最高人民法院华东分院已于八月七日批准了上述判决，又鉴于该案系违犯婚姻法、阻止妇女解放从而残杀妇女的典型事件，已令临沂分院接到核准令后，除在犯罪所在地召开群众大会宣判外，并进一步开展广泛而深入的宣传教育工作，借以教育群众，而利婚姻法的贯彻执行。（转载光明日报）
