    Learning Mao Zedong's Methods of Handling Problems
    To the Editor:
    After reading the classic document "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," I deeply realized that Chairman Mao is most adept at handling problems from the perspective of the development of things.
    In "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," Chairman Mao taught us that when observing problems, we should not be misled by superficial phenomena; only by deeply grasping the essence of phenomena and mastering the viewpoint of development can we have a scientific analysis. In 1929, when some comrades in the Party encountered the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," they developed pessimistic emotions and raised the question of "How long can the red flag last?" Chairman Mao pointed out to them: "Although there is only a small force now, its development will be very rapid. In the Chinese environment, it not only has the possibility of development, but also the inevitability of development. This has been fully demonstrated in the May 30th Movement and the subsequent Great Revolution." History has finally eloquently proved the correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis.
    From this, we can see how deeply Chairman Mao grasped and developed the developmental viewpoint of dialectical materialism, and therefore he had the greatest confidence to lead the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle.
    This viewpoint of dialectical materialism developed by Chairman Mao played a brilliant role in all revolutionary periods in China. Especially during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, in which the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism, it was further developed.
    As early as the initial stage of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, when the "quick victory theory" and the "national subjugation theory" were rampant in the country, Chairman Mao published "On Protracted War." In this historic work, Chairman Mao correctly grasped the main factors determining the war: the enemy is a strong country, and we are a weak country; the enemy is waging a regressive and barbaric war of aggression, and we are waging a progressive and just war of anti-aggression; the enemy has little assistance, and we have much assistance; the enemy is a small country, and we are a large country. Chairman Mao pointed out that these factors restrict each other in the course of the war, and will eventually lead to changes in the balance of power between the enemy and us. Therefore, Chairman Mao concluded that the war is protracted and cannot be won quickly; but the final victory must belong to us. This developmental viewpoint of dialectical materialism has once again been proven by history.

### 学习毛主席处理问题的方法

    学习毛主席处理问题的方法编辑同志：
    读过了“星星之火，可以燎原”这一经典的文献。我深深地体会到，毛主席是最善于从事物发展的观点上来处理问题的。
    在“星星之火，可以燎原”中，毛主席教导我们，在观察问题的时候，不要为表面的现象所迷惑；只有深刻地抓住现象的实质，掌握发展的观点，才能有科学的分析。当一九二九年时，党内部分同志，在遇到敌人的“会剿”后，发生了悲观的情绪，提出“红旗到底打得多久”的疑问。毛主席就对他们这样地指出：“现在虽只有一点小小的力量，但是它的发展会是很快的。它在中国的环境里不仅是具备了发展的可能性，简直是具备了发展的必然性，这在五卅运动及其以后的大革命运动已经得了充分的证明。”历史终于雄辩地证明了毛主席这一论断的正确。
    由此可见，毛主席是怎样深刻地掌握并发展了唯物辩证法的发展观点，因而他有最大的信心，坚持领导了中国人民的革命斗争。
    为毛主席所发展了的这一唯物辩证法的观点，在中国各革命时期，都起了辉煌的作用。特别是在中国人民击败日本帝国主义侵略的八年抗日战争中，它更获得了进一步的发展。
    还在抗日战争的初期，当国内“速胜论”与“亡国论”异常嚣张的时候，毛主席发表了“论持久战”。在这一历史性的著作中，毛主席就正确地掌握了决定战争的主要因素：敌人是强国，而我是弱国；敌人所进行的是退步的野蛮的侵略战争，而我所进行的是进步的正义的反侵略战争；敌人寡助，而我多助；敌人是小国，而我是大国。毛主席指出，这些因素，在战争的过程中，互相制约，终必将引起敌我力量对比的变化。因此，毛主席就得出结论：战争是持久的，不能速胜；但最后胜利一定是属于我们的。这一唯物辩证法的发展观点，又一次地得到了历史的证明。
