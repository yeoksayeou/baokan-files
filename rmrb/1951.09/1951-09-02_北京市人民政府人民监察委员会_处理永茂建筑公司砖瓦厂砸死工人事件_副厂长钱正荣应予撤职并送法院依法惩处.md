    Beijing Municipal People's Government People's Supervision Committee
    Handles the Yongmao Construction Company Brickyard Worker Death Incident
    Deputy Director Qian Zhengrong Should Be Removed from His Post and Sent to Court for Legal Punishment
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government People's Supervision Committee, regarding the incident of the collapse of the drying shed at the Yongmao Construction Company Materials Department North Suburb Brickyard (now renamed Second Mechanized Brickyard) resulting in worker deaths and injuries, has submitted a request to the Municipal People's Government for approval and made the following dispositions:
    The public-owned Yongmao Construction Company Materials Department began preparing for the construction of the North Suburb Brickyard on April 15, 1951. Engineer Han Zhongying and Production Section Deputy Chief Qian Zhengrong of the department were appointed as the chief and deputy directors of the preparatory committee, and chief and deputy directors of the brickyard, respectively. It was determined that Han Zhongying would be responsible for leading the brick and tile technology work, and Qian Zhengrong would be responsible for administrative leadership and construction management. Construction of forty drying sheds began on May 5th, without prior surveying and design by engineers, and without reporting to the Construction Bureau for approval and licensing, they blindly started construction. At approximately 5:30 PM on May 29th, during a heavy rain, all twenty of the unfinished drying sheds collapsed. More than forty workers who had temporarily moved into the sheds to escape the leaking worker dormitories were completely buried inside, resulting in the deaths of workers Zhang Gou, He Dacong, Liang Fayuan, Cheng Juzeng, Li Jintian, and others, totaling five deaths, six serious injuries, and nineteen minor injuries. This caused serious damage to state property and loss of workers' lives.
    Brickyard Deputy Director Qian Zhengrong was directly responsible for leading the brickyard's administration and construction management work, but in order to show off his abilities, he made decisions lightly, found contractors Yin Diankui, Cui Qichang, and others to sign contracts, and without formal design, approval from the Construction Bureau, or formal supervisors, blindly started constructing the drying sheds. When the Construction Bureau learned that the project did not meet regulations and notified him to stop work, he used various reasons to perfunctorily deal with the situation, even threateningly saying, "Who will be responsible if the task is not completed?" He was even more indifferent to the workers' lives and safety. After it rained, the worker dormitories leaked, and the water was very deep, but he didn't ask or care, so the workers had no choice but to move into the drying sheds to take shelter from the rain, which led to them being crushed. Therefore, he bears the primary responsibility for this unfortunate incident and should be removed from his post and sent to court for legal punishment.
    Brickyard Director Han Zhongying, although only responsible for technical work in the specific division of labor and not responsible for administrative matters, had discussed the plan to build the sheds with Qian Zhengrong. Therefore, he cannot be completely without responsibility for this accident. However, during the construction of the drying sheds, he went to Qingdao to purchase machinery, and he was sick when the houses collapsed, so he should be given a lenient warning.
    Materials Department Director Cui Yancai of Yongmao was directly responsible for leading the work of the North Suburb Brickyard, but he adopted a serious bureaucratic attitude of letting things drift. He should be given two major demerits, and the criminal part should be transferred to the court for investigation and handling.
    Materials Department Kiln Section Chief Li Shen was one of the preparatory committee members of the North Suburb Brickyard. The preparatory committee decided that he was responsible for contacting the Materials Department, but he only emphasized that the work of his department was busy and did not consider the construction work; he should be given one major demerit.
    Materials Department Deputy Director Gao Yunchao was careless in his work and should bear some responsibility for the accident. However, because he had just taken office and was not familiar with the business, and because the division of labor between the chief and deputy directors was not clear enough, he should be given a lenient demerit.
    Yongmao Construction Company Manager Zhong Sen believed that the drying shed drawings drawn by Qian Zhengrong and others did not meet standards, but he only refused to stamp them and did not actively urge them to redesign the drawings according to reasonable standards. The Construction Bureau had notified him in person to order the brickyard负责人 to stop work, but he did not strictly implement it. However, because he did not bear the leadership responsibility for the Materials Department in the specific division of labor, he is exempt from punishment, but he should conduct a deep self-criticism and learn a lesson.
    Yongmao Company concurrent General Manager Li Gongxia and Supervisor Zhang Ruoping did not provide enough leadership and education to their cadres, and lacked supervision and inspection. They should conduct a deep self-criticism.
    Bricklayer bosses Yin Diankui and Yin Guohua violated the contract and deceived the factory, recruiting 74 workers, of whom only 11 were formal bricklayers, resulting in sloppy and crude construction and cutting corners by taking soil on site. The foundation sank after the rain, which was the direct cause of the house collapse. They also disregarded the workers' lives, failing to pay the workers after receiving their wages, and the worker dormitories leaked, making them uninhabitable. This is a concrete manifestation of the feudal foremen deceiving owners and exploiting and oppressing workers, and they should be sent to court for legal punishment.
    Carpenter boss Cui Qichang deceived the owner and, when signing the contract with the factory, inflated the number of workers (much more than actually needed) and cut corners, not making mortise and tenon joints at the joints of the frame, but only using nails, and there were no cross braces between the frames, making the frame very fragile. He should bear direct responsibility for the accident and should be sent to court for legal punishment. (Beijing Municipal News Agency)

    北京市人民政府人民监察委员会
    处理永茂建筑公司砖瓦厂砸死工人事件
    副厂长钱正荣应予撤职并送法院依法惩处
    北京市人民政府人民监察委员会对于永茂建筑公司材料部北郊砖瓦厂（现改为第二机制砖瓦厂）晾瓦棚倒塌死伤工人事件的有关人员，已呈请市人民政府批准，作如下的处理：
    公营永茂建筑公司材料部于一九五一年四月十五日开始筹备建筑北郊砖瓦厂，由该部工程师韩锺英和生产科副科长钱正荣分任正副筹备主任及正副厂长，并确定韩锺英负责领导制砖瓦技术工作，钱正荣负责行政领导与施工管理。五月五日动工修建晾瓦棚四十间，事先未经工程师勘测设计，也未报建设局批准发照即盲目施工。五月二十九日下午五时半左右，在急雨中，尚未竣工的晾瓦棚二十间全部倒塌，其中住有因工棚漏雨，临时搬入的工人四十多人，全部压在里面，计砸死工人张狗、何大从、梁发源、程聚增、李金田等五人，重伤六人，轻伤十九人。造成了国家财产和工人生命的严重损失。
    砖瓦厂副厂长钱正荣，直接负责领导建厂行政及施工管理工作，但他为了显示自己的本领，轻作主张，找包工头尹殿魁、崔其昌等订立合同，未经正式设计报建设局批准发照，也无正式监工人员，便盲目动工修建晾瓦棚。建设局查知其工程不合规定通知他停工时，他竟以种种理由搪塞敷衍，并以“完成不了任务谁负责？”的话相威胁。至于工人的生活与安全，他更是漠不关心。下雨后工棚漏雨，而且积水很深，他也不闻不问，因此工人不得不搬入晾瓦棚内避雨，以致被压。所以此次不幸事件的发生他要负主要责任，应予撤职送法院依法惩办。
    砖瓦厂厂长韩锺英，虽在具体分工上仅负责技术工作，不负行政责任；但钱正荣在计划盖房时曾与他商量过，故对此次事故，不能完全没有责任。惟在晾瓦棚修建期间，他曾赴青岛购买机器，且房屋倒塌时正在病中，应从轻予以警告处分。
    永茂材料部主任崔彦彩直接负责领导北郊砖瓦厂工作，但他对该厂工作却采取了放任不管的严重官僚主义态度。应予记大过二次，刑事部分移送法院研究处理。
    材料部窑业科科长李深，是北郊砖瓦厂筹备委员之一，筹备委员会决定他负责与材料部联系，但他一味强调本部工作忙，对建厂工作未加考虑；应予记大过一次处分。
    材料部副主任高云超，在工作上粗枝大叶，对事故的发生应负一定责任，惟因他到职不久，对业务还不熟习，加以正副主任分工不够明确，故从轻予以记过处分。
    永茂建筑公司经理锺森，认为钱正荣等所绘晾瓦棚图样不合标准，但仅拒绝盖章，并未积极督促按合理标准另行设计绘图；建设局曾当面通知他命令砖瓦厂负责人停工，他也未严格执行，惟因在具体分工上，他未担负材料部的领导责任，免予议处，但应进行深刻检讨，接受教训。
    永茂公司兼总经理李公侠、监理张若平，平时对干部领导、教育不够，并缺乏督促检查，应进行深刻检讨。
    瓦工头尹殿魁、尹国华违反合同，欺骗厂方，招来工人七十四人中只有十一人是正式瓦工，以致工程作法草率粗糙，并偷工减料，就地取土，下雨后墙基下沉，造成房屋倒塌的直接原因。他们又不顾工人生活，领到工资后不发给工人，所搭工棚漏雨，工人无法居住，这是封建把头欺骗业主剥削压迫工人的具体表现，应送法院依法惩处。
    木工头崔其昌欺骗业主，与厂方订合同时，虚报工数（比实际需要的超出很多），且偷工减料，房架接头处不作笋头，只用钉钉住，房架之间又无十字撑，以致房架非常脆弱。对此次事故应负直接责任，应送法院依法惩处。（京市新闻处）
