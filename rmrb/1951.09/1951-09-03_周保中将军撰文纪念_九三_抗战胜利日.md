General Zhou Baozhong, one of the leaders of the former Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and current Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government, wrote an article to commemorate "September 3rd" Victory Over Japan Day. He detailed the historical facts of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army's growth and persistence in the Anti-Japanese War under extremely difficult conditions, explaining that China suffered the most from Japanese aggression and that the Chinese people made the greatest contribution in the Anti-Japanese War. He noted that only with the Soviet Union's intervention did the heinous war of the Japanese fascist bandits come to an end. General Zhou Baozhong said: Now American imperialism is attempting to revive Japanese fascism and provoke a new war in Asia. After launching the war of aggression against Korea, it dares to disregard the will of our 475 million people, exclude our country from the peace treaty with Japan, forge a draft peace treaty with Japan, and arbitrarily convene the San Francisco Conference. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. General Zhou Baozhong said: This forged treaty not only antagonizes China and the Soviet Union, endangers the security of Asian countries, and threatens peace in the Far East and the world, but will also be a great disaster for the Japanese people. The new Chinese people, who have grown strong from the Anti-Japanese War and the world anti-fascist struggle, will resolutely oppose this so-called "peace treaty." We Chinese people must heighten our vigilance and unremittingly strengthen all efforts to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. The Chinese people will see that although American imperialism does not understand and is unwilling to understand the lessons of history, historical lessons will force American imperialism to accept them.

    周保中将军撰文纪念“九三”抗战胜利日
    前东北抗日联军的领导人之一现任云南省人民政府副主席周保中撰文纪念“九三”抗战胜利日。他详细叙述了东北抗日联军成长壮大和在极端困难条件下坚持抗日战争的历史事实，说明中国受日寇侵略灾害最重，中国人民在抗日战争中立功最大，最后由于苏联出兵，才结束了日本法西斯强盗的罪恶战争。周保中将军说：现在美帝国主义力图使日本法西斯死灰复燃，力图挑起亚洲的新战争，在发动侵略朝鲜的战争之后，又敢蔑视我国四亿七千五百万人民的意志，排斥我国于对日和约之外，伪制对日和约草案，擅自召开旧金山会议。这是我国人民绝不能容忍的。周保中将军说：这一伪制和约，不仅敌视中苏两国，危害亚洲各国的安全，威胁远东与世界和平，而且也将是日本人民的大灾难。从抗日战争和世界反法西斯侵略斗争中生长壮大起来的新中国人民，将坚决反对这个所谓“和约”。我们中国人民必须提高警惕，毫不松懈地加强抗美援朝保家卫国的一切努力。中国人民将会看到美帝国主义虽然不懂得和不愿懂得历史教训，但是历史教训却会强迫美帝国主义接受的。（新华社）
