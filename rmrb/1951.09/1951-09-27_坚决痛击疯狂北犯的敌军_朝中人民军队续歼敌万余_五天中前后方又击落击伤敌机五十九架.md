Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 26th: Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to achieve brilliant victories in the battles to resist and counterattack the enemy's mad northern advance. According to statistics from the five days of September 11th to 15th, the Korean-Chinese People's Army annihilated a total of more than 10,400 enemy troops, including more than 4,800 American invading troops and more than 5,500 Rhee Syngman puppet troops, and destroyed 5 enemy tanks and 17 vehicles. The Korean-Chinese People's Army also shot down or damaged 59 enemy aircraft over the front and rear areas. Disregarding heavy losses, the American and Rhee Syngman forces are frantically advancing in the mountainous areas north of Inje and Yanggu on the eastern front, but under the staunch resistance and counterattacks of the Korean-Chinese People's Army, the American and Rhee Syngman forces have suffered even more severe losses. Since the 9th, the fiercest fighting has taken place in the mountainous area along the Seongnae-dong, Hwanggi, and Song-eo-ri line north of Inje. The American and Rhee Syngman forces have deployed five regiments in this section of only six kilometers, attacking each target more than twelve times a day, at an extremely heavy price. In the six days from the 9th to the 14th alone, a certain unit of our army annihilated more than 1,300 American troops and more than 5,600 Rhee Syngman puppet troops in this area. The high-spirited Korean-Chinese soldiers mocked: This is one of the "achievements" obtained in Van Fleet's touted "limited objective offensive." In the northeast of Yanggu, a certain unit of our army also continued to achieve victories in fiercely attacking the invading enemy. In the areas north of Cheorwon and Yeoncheon on the western front, a certain unit of our army also continuously repelled the harassment of small groups of enemy troops.

    坚决痛击疯狂北犯的敌军
    朝中人民军队续歼敌万余
    五天中前后方又击落击伤敌机五十九架
   【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在阻击与反击疯狂北犯之敌的战斗中继续获得辉煌战果。据十一日到十五日五天的统计，朝中人民军队共计歼灭敌军一万零四百余名，其中美国侵略军占四千八百余名，李伪军占五千五百余名，并击毁敌战车五辆，汽车十七辆。朝、中人民军队又在前线和后方的上空击落击伤敌机五十九架。不顾惨重损失的美、李军在东线麟蹄、杨口以北山地疯狂进犯，但在朝中人民军队的坚强阻击和反击下，美、李军又遭受更加惨重的损失。从九日起，最激烈的战斗发生在麟蹄以北城内洞、黄基、松鱼月一线山地。美、李军在这个仅有六公里的地段投入五个团的兵力，每日向每个目标的攻击多到十二次以上，其所付出的代价极其惨重。仅在九日到十四日的六天中，我军某部即在该地歼灭了一千三百多名美军和五千六百多名李伪军。斗志昂扬的朝中战士们嘲笑说：这就是范佛里特吹嘘的“目标有限攻势”中所得到的“成绩”之一。在杨口东北地区，我军某部也继续在痛击犯敌中获得胜利。在西线铁原、涟川以北等地区，我军某部也连续击退小股敌军的袭扰。
