    "Sell More Patriotic Cotton, Factories Spin More Yarn!"
    Northern Jiangsu Cotton Farmers Actively Sell New Cotton
    New cotton has entered the market in large quantities in Northern Jiangsu, and cotton farmers are now actively selling new cotton to the state. This year, Northern Jiangsu planted 4.8 million mu of cotton, an increase of 1.3 million mu compared to last year. The total output of lint cotton in the region this year is over 1 million dan, an increase of 400,000 dan compared to last year. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Northern Jiangsu began purchasing new cotton one after another in the first ten days of this month. According to incomplete statistics from Nantong County, cooperatives have purchased more than 300,000 jin of cotton to date. Members of the Liuqiao Cooperative, under the slogan "Sell More Patriotic Cotton, Factories Spin More Yarn," launched a competition of "Quick Picking, Quick Drying, Quick Ginning, and Quick Selling." Every morning, the cooperative entrance is crowded with farmers selling new cotton. To facilitate cotton farmers' sales of new cotton, cooperatives in various places have also dispatched mobile cotton purchasing teams to conduct purchases. In order to implement the policy of "better price for better quality," the People's Governments of Nantong, Yancheng and other places have specially trained and absorbed a group of technicians to help inspect cotton at various cotton collection points. Jingjiang, Xinghua and other counties in Taizhou Prefecture have organized a considerable number of cotton gins around each cooperative for processing, so that they can gin cotton as soon as it is purchased and supply the raw cotton to spinning mills in a timely manner.

    “多卖爱国花，工厂多纺纱！”
    苏北棉农踊跃出售新棉
    苏北区新棉已大量上市，各地棉农现正踊跃地向国家出售新棉。苏北区今年植棉四百八十万市亩，比去年增加一百三十万亩，全区今年产皮棉一百万担以上，比去年增加四十万担。苏北各地合作社在本月上旬就已先后开始收购新棉。据南通县不完全统计，到目前止，合作社已收购棉花三十多万斤。刘桥合作社社员在“多卖爱国花、工厂多纺纱”的口号下，展开“快拾、快晒、快轧、快卖”的比赛。每天大清早，合作社门口便挤满了出售新棉的农民。为便利棉农出售新棉，各地合作社并派出流动购棉小组进行收购。南通、盐城等地人民政府为贯彻优级优价政策，特地训练与吸收一批技术人员至各地收花点帮助验花。泰州专区的靖江、兴化等县在每一个合作社周围都组织了相当数量的轧花机进行加工，以便随购随轧，将原棉及时供应纱厂。
