    The Fifteenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fuyu County
    Neglects Political Education for Peasants; Has Begun to Pay Attention to Correction After Inspection

Editor Comrades:

    We have examined our own work and study, and discovered a tendency of neglecting politics in our work and study. Taking our leadership in production as an example, every time we convene a meeting of village cadres or a mass meeting, we only talk about the aspect of getting rich by organizing ourselves, and emphatically tell the masses that the Northeast People's Government has prepared a large number of prizes for this; however, we have not told the masses the significance and development direction of organizing peasants. Therefore, on the one hand, the masses have developed a mentality of being satisfied with the status quo, and on the other hand, individual mutual aid team members have developed the idea and behavior of wanting to leave the mutual aid team, buy horses on their own, and work independently because their production capital has increased and their lives have improved. In the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, some district cadres told the masses: As long as you produce more grain, you are resisting America and aiding Korea, and you don't necessarily have to join the army and fight. Therefore, some farmers are only satisfied with farming and producing more grain.

    Among the leading cadres of the District Committee, there is a wrong idea, which is "It doesn't matter if the political level is high or not, as long as you can do a good job." They emphasized work and relaxed study, thus pitting work against study, making it difficult for everyone to study well and work well. Recently, we held a political test, and of the thirteen cadres who participated, only four passed.

    Through this inspection, we deeply realized the importance of studying politics. Now we have decided to strengthen policy study and current affairs study, and to pay attention to the political and ideological situation of cadres in service, so as to guide cadres to do various tasks better.

        Wang Zhixue, Secretary of the Fifteenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fuyu County, Jilin Province

### 中共扶余县十五区委员会  忽视对农民进行政治教育  经过检查已开始注意纠正

    中共扶余县十五区委员会
    忽视对农民进行政治教育
    经过检查已开始注意纠正编辑同志：
    我们检查了自己的工作和学习，发现我们的工作和学习中存在着不问政治的倾向。以我们领导生产来说，我们每次召开村干部会议或群众会议时，首先都是只讲组织起来能发家的一面，并强调地告诉群众说，东北人民政府对此已准备了大量奖品；我们却没有把农民组织起来的意义和发展方向等告诉群众。因此，一方面在群众中就产生了满足现状的思想，另一方面，也产生了个别互助组员因为生产资本增加了，生活提高了，就想脱离互助组，自己买马单干的思想和行为。在抗美援朝宣传中，有的区干部对群众说：只要多打粮食，就是抗美援朝，不一定总得去参军参战。因此某些农民们也只满足于种地多打粮食。
    在区委员会的领导干部中存在着一种错误的想法，就是“不管政治水平高不高，只要能做好工作就好。”并强调了工作，放松了学习，这样把工作和学习对立起来，使得大家学习既不好，工作也不能作好。最近我们举行了一次政治测验，参加干部十三人，其中只有四人及格。
    经过这次检查，我们深深地体验到学习政治的重要。现在我们已决定要加强政策学习和时事学习，并经常注意在职干部的政治、思想情况，以便指导干部把各种工作做得更好。
        中共吉林省扶余县第十五区委员会书记  王志学
