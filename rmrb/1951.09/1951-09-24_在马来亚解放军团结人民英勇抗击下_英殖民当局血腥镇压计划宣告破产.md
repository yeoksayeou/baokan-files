Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd:

Under the heroic resistance of the Malayan National Liberation Army and the unity of the Malayan people, the so-called "Briggs Plan" used by British imperialists to suppress the Malayan people has now been declared bankrupt.

Since June of last year, the British colonial authorities have implemented the brutal "Briggs Plan" in Malaya. They attempted to drive the Malayan National Liberation Army out state by state, starting with the southern state of Johor and continuing to the Thai border. According to this plan, they planned to detain the people in the guerrilla war zones in concentration camps to create vast "no-man's lands." As of June of this year, the British colonial authorities had already detained 500,000 peaceful Malayan people. However, the Malayan National Liberation Army, with the support of the people, shattered the "Briggs Plan."

More than a year after the much-hyped "Briggs Plan" was implemented, the British big bourgeoisie newspaper "Financial Times" had to admit this failure on September 14th. The newspaper said: "Incidents are occurring more frequently again in areas that were thought to have been cleared months ago."

"The funds spent by the government on this 'emergency' are constantly increasing, and a lot of money has been spent on building concentration camps." However, "the guerrillas have returned to their original areas." "What is worrisome is that several recent incidents have occurred in the Kuala Lumpur and Johor areas."

A United Press International dispatch from Singapore on September 5th also admitted: "After three years of guerrilla warfare, using various modern weapons," "their (referring to the Malayan National Liberation Army) activities have not diminished slightly." The UPI reporter sadly said: "The Briggs Plan has gone bankrupt."

Recently, Briggs, the drafter and executor of this bloody plan, and the "Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Malaya," has also stepped down because of this.

### 在马来亚解放军团结人民英勇抗击下  英殖民当局血腥镇压计划宣告破产

    在马来亚解放军团结人民英勇抗击下
    英殖民当局血腥镇压计划宣告破产
    【新华社二十二日讯】英帝国主义者用以镇压马来亚人民的所谓“布里格斯计划”，在马来亚民族解放军团结马来亚人民一致英勇抗击下，现已宣告破产。
    英国殖民当局自去年六月以来，即在马来亚施行残暴的“布里格斯计划”。他们企图把马来亚民族解放军逐州赶走，先从南部的柔佛州做起，以迄泰国边境为止。按照这个计划，他们准备把游击战区域内的人民都拘禁在集中营里造成广大的“无人区”。截至今年六月为止，英国殖民当局已经拘禁了五十万马来亚和平人民。但是，马来亚民族解放军在人民群众的支援下，粉碎了“布里格斯计划”。
    大吹大擂的“布里格斯计划”实行一年多后，英国大资产阶级的报纸“金融时报”于九月十四日已不得不承认这种失败。该报说：“事件又重新在几个月前以为是肃清了的地区更频繁地发生”。
    “政府在这个‘紧急状态’上所用的经费正不断地增加，建筑集中营花了很多钱”。可是，“游击队又回到了原来的地区”。“伤脑筋的是：最近有几次事件竟在吉隆坡及柔佛州的地区发生”。
    合众社新加坡九月五日电也承认：“经过三年的游击战争，动用了各种现代武器”，“他们（指马来亚民族解放军）的活动并没有稍减”。合众社记者悲哀地说：“布里格斯计划已经破产了”。
    最近连这个血腥计划的拟制人与执行人、“马来亚剿匪总司令”布里格斯也因此而下台了。
