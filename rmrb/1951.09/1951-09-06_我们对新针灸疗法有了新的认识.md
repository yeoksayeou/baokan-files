    We Have a New Understanding of New Acupuncture Therapy
    To the Editor:
    Since the People's Daily published Comrade Zhu Lian's article "The Importance and Principles of Acupuncture Therapy," we have conducted research and discussions, and realized that our past view of belittling acupuncture therapy was wrong.
    In late June, with the consent of the leading comrades of our unit, we came to the Central Ministry of Health to study acupuncture therapy under the guidance of Comrade Zhu Lian and comrades from the acupuncture group. So far, we have actually come into contact with more than 800 patients, more than 90% of whom have been examined and treated in major hospitals, and were considered to have chronic stubborn diseases that were difficult to treat effectively, or simply untreatable. However, after acupuncture treatment, some of these patients have recovered, and most of the symptoms have been alleviated; only a small number have not responded. What particularly surprised us was that some patients could experience miraculous "instant results" with a single needle. For example, a female patient, aged 54, was diagnosed with "sciatic nerve pain" by Beijing Hospital. After acupuncture treatment, the pain stopped immediately. Another male patient, aged 37, had numbness and pain in his right lower limb since April 1943, and was recently diagnosed with "rheumatic neuralgia" by the hospital, but did not receive proper treatment. However, after two acupuncture treatments, his right lower limb recovered. Another male patient had unbearable pain in his right arm and shoulder blade, and could not lie down. According to Beijing University Hospital, it was shoulder joint tuberculosis. After our acupuncture treatment, the patient immediately regained consciousness; later, after three consecutive days of acupuncture, the patient was able to get up and lie down freely. Another example is a female nurse who suffered from "hysteria" due to worrying about her future and family burden, crying and laughing erratically, and speaking incoherently. After examination by a mental hospital, it was believed that there was no specific medicine, but after three acupuncture treatments, the patient's speech returned to normal.
    In general, new acupuncture therapy is an effective therapy for many diseases, and it has a special effect on various types of nerve pain. These have been confirmed in our clinical experiments. Therefore, we suggest that Chinese and Western medical workers should pay attention to this scientific heritage.

### 我们对新针灸疗法有了新的认识

    我们对新针灸疗法有了新的认识编辑同志：
    自从人民日报发表朱琏同志的“针灸疗法的重要性及其原理”的论文以后，我们曾经进行了研究和讨论，发觉我们过去轻视针灸疗法的观点是错误的。
    六月下旬我们得到本单位领导同志的同意，来到中央卫生部，在朱琏同志和针灸组同志们的指导下，研究、学习针灸疗法。到目前为止，我们实际接触的患者已有八百多人，其中百分之九十以上曾经各大医院检查治疗，而被认为是慢性的顽固疾病，治疗很难收效，或是根本无法治疗的。但这些患者经过针灸治疗以后，一部分已经痊愈了，大部分症状已经减轻；未收效果的仅占少数。特别使我们感觉惊奇的是，有些病人在一针之下能够收到“立竿见影”的奇效。例如某女性患者，年五十四岁，据北京医院检查诊断为“坐骨神经疼”。经针灸治疗后，疼痛立刻停止了。又如某男性患者，年三十七岁，从一九四三年四月间开始，右下肢麻木疼痛，最近经医院检查诊断为“风湿性神经疼”，但未得到妥善治疗。但经二次针灸后，右下肢即恢复了。又有一男性患者，右臂膊及肩胛部疼不可忍，不能躺卧，据北大医院检查说是肩关节结核。经我们针治后，病人立即清醒；后来，连续针了三天，病人已能起卧自如了。又如某女护士，因忧虑自己的前途和家庭负担而患了“歇斯底里”症，哭笑无常、言语错乱。曾经某精神病院检查，认为无特效药，经我们针了三次以后，患者言谈已恢复正常了。
    总的看来，新针灸疗法对许多疾病是一种有效疗法，而它对各种神经性疼痛，尤有特殊的效能。这些，都在我们临床实验中，得到证实了。因此我们建议，中西医务工作者应该重视这一科学遗产。
