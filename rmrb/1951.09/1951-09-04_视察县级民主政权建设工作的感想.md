    Thoughts on Inspecting the Construction of County-Level Democratic Political Power
    Lecturers at Yenching University Chen Fangzhi, Zhang Xitong, Wang Qingyuan
    During this inspection tour of political power construction, we investigated three counties (Hejian, Jiaohe, and Qingxian) and several districts and villages in a short period of twenty-five days. We met with standing committee members and representatives of people's representatives conferences at the county level, and visited people from all walks of life. We gained many new understandings of the work of building people's democratic political power.
    First, we recognized the significance of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, turning over and becoming masters of their own affairs. A representative of the Qingxian People's Representatives Conference (formerly a sedan carrier) told us, "In the past, while carrying the county magistrate, I had to run very fast, as fast as the magistrate's attendants' horses." Today, he has turned over. He is not only a glorious people's representative but also elected as a standing committee member of the People's Representatives Conference. He eats at the same table as the county magistrate and discusses matters together. Zhang Guixin, a farmer from Dongli Village in Qingxian, said, "During the period of the enemy and puppets, everyone in the village was starving. Some became beggars and were beaten and scolded. Fortunately, with the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Dongli Village was liberated, and everyone can live happily in the village, have land, and live a good life." Yes, all the oppressed people have turned over and become masters of the new China!
    From the construction of political power in rural areas, we also recognize the importance of the people's democratic united front. Previously, we often had a question, thinking that there are only rural areas in the county, so why emphasize the united front like in the cities? This time going to the countryside corrected my previous misconception. From the People's Representatives Conference uniting people from all walks of life to carry out work together, we fully realized the power of the united front. Bai Yunzhong, a representative of the industrial and commercial circles at the Hejian County People's Representatives Conference, said, "In the past, the Hui people in the county never participated in any gatherings held by the People's Government. Since the establishment of the People's Representatives Conference, the situation has fundamentally changed. Through ethnic representatives, the estrangement between the Hui and Han nationalities has been eliminated. In the movements to resist America, aid Korea, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, the ethnic minorities in Hejian and all the people are united together to carry out work together. This was not the case in the past." The aforementioned representative Bai Yunzhong himself is a Hui. From his conversation, we learned that as soon as he arrived in various villages, everyone would surround him and ask him about everything. He said, "The payment of industrial and commercial taxes always used to be delayed for a long time. Since the convening of the People's Representatives Conference, tax collection has been completed in a few days." These examples fully illustrate the importance of the united front in rural areas.
    From the construction of political power in rural areas, we have seen even more the power of the masses. All work, through the mass line and relying on collective wisdom, will inevitably achieve the greatest results. In the spring of 1950, Jiaohe County suffered a severe disaster, and the government called on all villages to engage in production for self-relief. However, some farmers were passive and would not move forward no matter how the cadres persuaded them. No one was interested in the government's production loans. The county People's Government submitted the problem to the People's Representatives Conference for resolution. After research and discussion by the representatives, they found that the crux of the problem lay in the middle peasants' concerns, so they were unwilling to actively engage in production. Therefore, a symposium of middle peasant representatives was held to resolve ideological problems. After the ideological problems were resolved, the representatives returned to their villages to publicize and began to vigorously increase production, setting an example. Short-term labor markets were restored in various villages; the problem of feeding livestock and accumulating fertilizer was also solved; and leather tanning and transportation were carried out to solve the living problems of disaster victims. In the movements to resist America, aid Korea, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, through the People's Representatives Conference, the masses acted as masters and generated infinite power.
    During the inspection, we gained a more profound understanding of the work style and methods of many cadres.
    In the counties, districts, and villages we visited, we saw that all cadres were working diligently and intensively. In addition to their regular work, most cadres often have to perform various temporary tasks simultaneously. When we were in the Cangxian Special District, leading cadres from several counties had to simultaneously preside over the movements for increasing production and donating, the general survey of substitute farming work, as well as locust control, aphid eradication, and flood prevention. Flood prevention work in riverside counties is urgent and heavy. During the most tense times, leading cadres of the county had to go to the dikes and stay on the dikes for many days, only taking time to return to the county town to handle daily affairs. Some originally temporary tasks cannot be completed in a short period of time, or even become regular, and all regular work must be gradually improved. We deeply recognize how hard and difficult the comrades of the county, district, and village cadres are working to carry out their tasks and strive to serve the people.
    What touched us even more was that no matter how short-handed the special commissioner's office or the county, district, and village people's governments were, they would unhesitatingly and unreservedly select capable cadres and immediately send them up when they received a notice from higher authorities to transfer cadres. This not only shows that they absolutely oppose departmentalism in their work; but more importantly, it also shows their spirit of obeying and loving the higher authorities.
    If there are still people today who think that "the current regulations are not ready and the people's wisdom is not yet developed," then they only need to have a conversation with a few village cadres and farmers for an hour or two to know that their ideas are completely wrong. We have such an experience: the content of substitute farming work is complicated, the various methods of substitute farming work have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the implementation of the work-point system and district-county overall planning has many technical difficulties, plus many specialized terms, which make us feel very difficult to learn about the substitute farming system. We had in mind: "The system is so complicated, I'm afraid the village cadres and farmers can't fully understand it!" However, the opposite is true. Village cadres and farmers are very familiar with substitute farming work, which makes us marvel at the wisdom of the masses. This fact also makes us realize that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the broad masses of the Chinese people have the opportunity to fully develop their wisdom and use their wisdom as much as possible to seek their own happiness!
    After the land reform, the peasant compatriots became active in production. Especially after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, their enthusiasm became even higher. Women generally participated in labor, and they were farming like men. Women in the past were not qualified to walk freely on this land under the oppression of feudal forces. Today they have liberated themselves from the struggle, and they are also struggling to ensure their equal status.
    Let us report the scene of farmers actively producing. One night, in the hazy moonlight, we were in the small courtyard of a farmer's house in Liulin Village, Hejian County, talking to an old farmer about drought-resistant cotton planting. He said, "Since the government called for planting cotton, Liulin Village has planted more than 400 mu. However, when sowing, it was dry, so all the men, women, old and young in the village started working together, carrying water, digging pits, and sowing seeds. The sowing work was completed in two days." Just imagine, what a great scene this is!
    Peasant compatriots are not only unprecedentedly active in production, but they also know that unity is strength. In Qingxian, we went to Xinzhuangzi to visit a representative of the People's Representatives Conference; but when we walked into the village, it was deserted. Later, we learned that he and everyone else had gone to the dike. So we went to the dike to meet him. We talked and watched on the dike, and the farmers from the villages on the left and right banks were enthusiastically building flood control works. The farmers in Xinzhuangzi completed the section they were responsible for—eighteen large "earth oxen"—in less than two hours. Looking into the distance, sections of the project were connected like the Great Wall! As we walked from Xinzhuangzi along the dike to Tangyao, the various sections of the project were completed as quickly as Xinzhuangzi. One after another "earth oxen" proudly watched the wild flood in the river, as if reminding us: "Remember, unity is strength!"
    Our peasant compatriots also have a very high political awareness. Their sincere faces and earnest tones made us, who have been locked in the study for a long time, feel close. In Hejian, we had a chat with an old farmer. He was almost seventy years old, and his beard was a little gray. From his conversation, we learned that in addition to constantly participating in various meetings in the district and village and cultivating his own land, he also regularly contributed his decades of farming experience to guide cotton planting in the village. We asked him: "Old man, don't you feel too tired at such an old age?" He shook his head vigorously and said, "For the sake of resisting America and aiding Korea, I don't feel tired!" From Hejian to Jiaohe, and from Jiaohe to Qingxian, everyone often talked about the issue of substitute farming. Many farmers said, "Don't forget the well-digger when drinking water," "People are going out to fight, and we are living and working in peace. We should do a good job of substitute farming for them; even if we do a good job, it is not enough!"

    视察县级民主政权建设工作的感想
    燕京大学教员  陈芳芝  张锡彤  王庆源
    我们这次参加政权建设视察组，在短短的二十五天内，调查了三个县（河间、交河、青县）和若干区村，会见了若干县各界人民代表会议的常委和代表，访问了各界的群众，对人民民主建政工作有了许多新的认识。
    我们首先认识了中国人民在中国共产党领导下翻身当家作主的意义。青县各界人民代表会议的一位代表（从前是抬轿子的）对我们说：“我从前一面抬着县长，一面要跑得很快，要和县长随从们的马一样快。”今天，他翻身了，他不仅是光荣的人民代表，并且当选为人民代表会议的常委。他和县长同桌吃饭，有事共同商量。青县东李村的农民张贵新说：“敌伪时期，村里人人饿着肚子过日子，有的去当乞丐，挨打受骂。幸亏有了共产党，有了毛主席，东李村才得到解放，大伙才能安乐地住在村子里，分了地，过好日子。”是的，一切被压迫的人民翻了身，成了新中国的主人！
    从农村的政权建设我们也认识了人民民主统一战线的重要。以前我们常有一种疑问，以为县里只有农村，何必像城市那样强调统一战线呢？这次下乡，纠正了我以前的错觉。从人民代表会议团结各界人民共同进行工作上，我们充分地体会到统一战线的力量。河间县各界人民代表会议的工商界代表白允中说：“从前县里的回族人民，从不参加人民政府所召开的任何集会，自从有了人民代表会议，情形就根本改变了。通过民族代表，回汉民族间消除了彼此的隔阂。在抗美援朝、镇压反革命等运动中，河间的少数民族和所有的人民团结在一起，共同进行工作。这是以往不会有的情形。”前面提到的白允中代表，本人就是回民。从他的谈话中我们得知，他一到各村，大家就把他围起来，谈长问短。他说：“工商税的交纳，过去总是拖延很久，自从召开了人民代表会议，税收几天就完成。”这些事例充分说明了统一战线在农村中的重要。
    从农村的政权建设我们更看见了群众的力量。一切工作，通过群众路线，依靠集体智慧，必然获得最大的成绩。一九五○年春季，交河县灾情严重，政府号召各村生产自救。但一部分农民态度消极，不管干部怎样劝说，总是裹足不前，政府的生产贷款也无人问津。县人民政府就将问题提交各界人民代表会议解决。经代表们研究讨论，发现问题症结在于中农思想上存在着顾虑，因而不肯积极生产。于是召开中农代表座谈会，解决了思想问题。思想问题解决后，代表们一面回村宣传，一面以身作则开始大力增产；各村恢复了短工市；喂牲口和积肥的问题也解决了；并且熬皮硝，搞运输，解决了灾民的生活问题。在抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动中，通过人民代表会议，群众以主人翁的身份行动起来，产生了无穷的力量。
    在视察中，我们对于许多干部的工作作风和工作方法有了比较深刻的认识。
    在我们所到的各县、区、村中，我们看见所有干部都在勤奋、紧张地工作着。多数干部在其经常的工作以外，还常须同时执行多种临时性的任务。当我们在沧县专区的时候，好几个县的领导干部便须同时主持增产捐献运动，代耕工作普查运动，以及捕蝗、根治蚜虫和防汛等工作。沿河县份的防汛工作是紧急而繁重的；最紧张的时候，县的领导干部都要上堤，并留在堤上许多日子，只能抽空回到县城料理一下日常事务。若干原系临时性的工作，非短时期所能完成，甚或变为经常的，而一切经常的工作又均须逐步提高。我们深深认识了各县、区、村干部同志是如何辛勤艰苦地在执行任务，努力为人民办事。
    使我们更感动的，是无论专署或县、区、村人民政府，尽管各自苦于干部不足，但一接到上级机关调用干部的通知，就毫不犹豫、毫无保留地选择得力的干部立即送上去。这不但表明他们绝对反对工作上的本位主义；而尤其重要的，这也表明他们服从和爱戴上级机关的精神。
    假如在今天还有人以为“目前规制未备，民智未开”，那么只消去同几位村干部和农民作一两小时的谈话，便可以知道自己的想法是完全错误的。我们有这样一个经验：代耕工作的内容是复杂的，代耕工作的各种办法互有利弊，工票制以及区县统筹的实施颇多技术上的困难，再加上许多专用的名词，使我们对代耕制度的学习很感觉吃力。我们曾在心里盘算：“制度这样复杂，村干部和农民们怕不能完全了解吧！”然而事实刚刚相反。村干部和农民们对于代耕工作却是非常熟悉，使我们惊叹于群众的智慧。这桩事实使我们也恍然于只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，中国的广大人民才有机会充分发扬自己的智慧，尽量用自己的智慧谋自己的幸福！
    土地改革后，农民同胞在生产上积极了。特别在镇压反革命之后，他们的积极性更为高涨。妇女普遍地参加了劳动，她们和男人一样在耕作着。妇女们在过去封建势力压迫下是没有资格在这块土地上面自由行走的。今天她们已从斗争中解放了自己，也正在斗争中来保证自己的平等地位。
    让我们报告农民积极生产的场面吧。一天晚上，在朦胧的月光下，我们在河间县柳林村一农家的小院子里，和一位老农谈起抗旱植棉的情况。他说：“自政府号召种棉以后，柳林村种了四百多亩。可是，下种时正赶上天旱，于是全村男女老幼一齐动手，挑水的挑水，挖坑的挖坑，播种的播种，两天便完成了播种工作。”试想，这是多么伟大的场面！
    农民同胞不仅在生产上空前积极，他们更知道团结就是力量。在青县，我们曾到辛庄子访问了人民代表会议的一位代表；可是走进村子一看，寂然无人。后来才知道他和大家一同上堤了。于是我们到堤上去会见了他。我们在堤上边谈边看，左右两岸的各村农民正热烈地修筑防汛工事。辛庄子的农民不到两个钟头便完成了应由他们负责的一段——十八座大“土牛”。我们向远处了望着，一段段的工事联缀起来犹如万里长城！当我们从辛庄子沿堤走向唐窑的时候，各段工程已像辛庄子一样地迅速完成了。一座座的“土牛”傲然监视着河内野马似的洪流，像在提醒我们：“记好，团结就是力量！”
    我们的农民同胞也有着很高的政治觉悟。他们的真挚的面孔，诚恳的语调，都使我们长期关在书房里的人感觉亲切。在河间，我们曾和一位老农攀谈，他是近七十岁的人了，胡子有些花白。从他的谈话间，我们知道他除了不断参加区村的各种会议，耕种自己的田地以外，还经常贡献他几十年来的耕作经验，指导村内种棉。我们问他：“老大爷，您这样大的年纪不感觉太累么？”他抖擞精神摇着头说：“为了抗美援朝，不觉得！”从河间到交河，从交河到青县，大家经常谈到代耕问题。许多农民都说：“喝水不忘掘井人”，“人家出人打仗，我们安居乐业，应该给人家代耕好；就是耕好，也不够哇！”
