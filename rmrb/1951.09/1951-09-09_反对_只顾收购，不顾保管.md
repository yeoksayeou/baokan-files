    Oppose "Only Focusing on Acquisition, Neglecting Storage"
    In several areas of Shandong, cadres of the grain companies have the mindset of "only focusing on acquisition, neglecting storage," resulting in serious damage to the acquired grain. According to preliminary statistics from the Laiyang, Huimin, and Xinpu sub-companies alone: grain damaged by insects, deterioration, and rot accounts for 4% of the total provincial stock. The most serious cases are the Huangxian branch company under the Laiyang sub-company and the Xinpu sub-company. In the former, grain damaged by insects accounts for 90% of the total inventory of coarse grains; in the latter, corn damaged by insects accounts for 70% of the total grain stock.
    Grain is one of the country's main financial resources today, and an important material force for consolidating national defense, stabilizing the market, and supporting various construction projects. Indifference to national grain, to the point of causing damage, is a serious mistake. The root cause of this error is that some cadres of the grain companies have a simplistic view of their tasks. They only focus on completing the immediate task and fail to see the ongoing tasks. They are satisfied with the acquisition achievements and forget the equally important task of grain storage. Isn't this like only caring about putting grain into a bag, while failing to see that the bottom of the bag has been gnawed with many large holes by rats? Quickly check and plug this big loophole!

### 反对“只顾收购，不顾保管”

    反对“只顾收购，不顾保管”
    山东若干地区的粮食公司的干部存在着“只顾收购，不顾保管”的思想，结果使收购的粮食遭到严重的损坏。仅据莱阳、惠民、新浦三个分公司初步统计：虫蚀、变质、霉烂的粮食，占全省总存量的百分之四，其中最严重的是莱阳分公司所属的黄县支公司，和新浦分公司，前者虫蚀的粮食占全部库存粗粮的百分之九十。后者虫蚀玉米占全部存粮的百分之七十。
    粮食是今天国家主要财力之一，是巩固国防、稳定市场及支持各种建设的一个重要物质力量。对国家粮食漠不关心以至造成损坏，是个严重的错误。这一错误的根源，是粮食公司的某些干部有单纯任务观点。他们只管完成眼前的任务，就看不见了经常的任务。他们满足于收购的成绩，就把同样重要的粮食保管工作忘掉了。这不等于只顾往布袋里装粮食，却看不见布袋底已被耗子咬了许多大洞吗？赶快检查一下，堵塞住这个大漏洞吧！
