    A Brief Commentary on Party Life

    The decision of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to expel Li Lei from the Party holds significant educational value for educators, literary and art workers, and cadres in general.

    Li Lei engaged in self-aggrandizement, touting himself as a "poet"; however, his mind was filled with reactionary bourgeois ideas that reached an extreme, and he completely lost the revolutionary feelings he should have had for the people. This kind of reactionary and degenerate ideological consciousness is intolerable at any time. The result of the development of this ideological consciousness is inevitably anti-Party and anti-people. Li Lei has already developed to this point.

    Today, American aggressors are barbarously destroying the cities and villages of Korea, slaughtering thousands of mothers and children; our motherland is also suffering from the threat of American imperialist aggression. At this time, literary and art workers on both the front and rear are using their pens to denounce the invaders and encourage the fighting people, yet at this very time, an shameless person like Li Lei has emerged in the ranks of cultural and educational workers. All revolutionary cultural and educational workers should rise up and attack such shameless "poets" and drive them far away from the revolutionary cultural ranks!

    In order to maintain the purity of the Party, uphold the standards of a Communist Party member without lowering them, every Party cultural and educational worker should learn from Li Lei's mistakes, be constantly vigilant against the invasion of reactionary bourgeois ideas, and strive for higher standards of a Communist Party member.

    纯洁党的队伍
    中共吉林省委员会开除李雷党籍的决定，对于教育工作者、文艺工作者以及一般干部，都有着重要的教育意义。
    李雷自吹自擂，把自己说成“诗人”；但是他装了一脑子资产阶级的反动思想，并且发展到了登峰造极的地步，他已经完全丧失了对于人民群众应有的革命感情。这种反动堕落的思想意识，在任何时候都是不可容忍的。这种思想意识发展的结果，必然是反党、反人民的。李雷已经发展到这样的地步了。
    今天美国侵略者正在野蛮地毁灭着朝鲜的城市和农村，屠杀成千的母亲和儿童；我们的祖国也正遭受着美帝国主义的侵略威胁。在这个时候，前线后方的文艺工作者都在用笔诛伐侵略者，鼓舞战斗着的人民，也就在这个时候，竟然在文化教育工作者的队伍中出现了像李雷这样的无耻之徒。一切革命的文化教育工作者对于此类无耻的“诗人”都应该群起而攻之，把他远远地驱逐于革命的文化队伍之外！
    为了保持党的纯洁，坚持共产党员的标准而不使之降低，每一个党的文化教育工作者，都应接受李雷的错误教训，时刻警惕资产阶级反动思想的侵袭，为更高的共产党员的标准而斗争。
