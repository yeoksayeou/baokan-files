    US Planes Continuously Intrude into Neutral Zone
    More Than Ten Intrusions Occurred in the Past Two Days
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nineteenth] Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Jiantu stationed in Kaesong reported on the 18th: The intensified activity of American jet planes and bombers seems to indicate that the US Air Force personnel have taken to heart the words in last night's "United Nations Command Situation Report," which said, "There has never been an agreement not to fly over Kaesong."
    Since the publication of this "Situation Report," American jet planes and bombers have flown over the neutral zone more than a dozen times. At 4:00 AM this morning, a B-26 type aircraft flew very low under the starry sky, and many people were awakened from their sleep by the air raid alarm. This afternoon, ten twin-engine bombers made many people in Kaesong hide in air-raid shelters. It was easy to recognize which side these bombers belonged to, because they were flying under the clouds after the rain cleared.
    Today's published special "Headquarters Press Office Official News Release" apparently feels that the "Situation Report" said too much, and now wants the world to believe that only one "United Nations aircraft" has flown over the neutral zone. Although the more than 10,000 residents of Kaesong can prove at any time that planes have flown over their heads countless times, the "Official News Release" of Ridgway's headquarters wants the world to believe that the jet planes and bombers that rumble back and forth over the neutral zone every day from near Kimpo Airport are not "United Nations aircraft."
    Ridgway once interrupted the meeting simply because his chief representative saw military police entering the meeting area with weapons, but he did not take any action against his jet planes and bombers carrying 500-pound bombs and rockets making hostile flights over Kaesong (since both sides agreed to cease all hostilities in Kaesong, there is not even a single anti-aircraft gun in Kaesong). If Ridgway ordered his planes not to fly over Kaesong, the strafing and bombing incidents that interrupted the armistice talks would not have occurred.

### 电通社记者报道：美机连续侵扰中立区  前两天又侵入十余架次

    电通社记者报道：
    美机连续侵扰中立区
    前两天又侵入十余架次
    【新华社十九日讯】电通社驻开城记者沈建图十八日报道：美国喷气飞机和轰炸机的加紧活动，似乎表示美国空军人员是把昨夜发表的“联合国军司令部情况汇报”中的话听进去了的，那里面说，“从来就不曾有过不飞过开城上空的协议。”
    自从这个“情况汇报”发表之后，美国喷气机和轰炸机飞过中立区上空的已达十几架次。今晨四时，一架B二十六型飞机在满布星斗的天空下飞得非常低，许多人都从睡梦中被空袭警报惊醒了。今天下午，十架双引擎的轰炸机使开城的许多人都躲到防空洞里去了，这些轰炸机属于那一方面是很容易认出的，因为它们是在雨后晴空的云层下飞行的。
    今天发表的特别的“总部新闻处官方新闻稿”，显然觉得“情况汇报”中说得太多，现在想要全世界相信，只有一架“联合国飞机”曾在中立区上空飞行过。虽然开城的一万多居民随时都能证明飞机在他们头上飞过无数次，但李奇微总部的“官方新闻稿”却要全世界相信，天天从金浦机场附近来回，在中立区上空隆隆飞行的喷气飞机和轰炸机不是“联合国飞机”。
    李奇微曾仅仅因为他的首席代表看见军事警察持武器进入会议地区而使会议中断，而对他的载有五百磅炸弹及火箭炮的喷气飞机和轰炸机在开城（由于双方同意在开城停止一切敌对行为，开城连一门高射炮也没有）上空作敌对飞行的事却不作任何处理。如果李奇微下令禁止他的飞机在开城上空飞行的话，使停战会议中断的扫射和轰炸事件是不会发生的。
