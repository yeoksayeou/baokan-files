The Department of Livelihood of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and its affiliated Shengji Lumber Mill's illegal operation of timber has been investigated by the Joint Timber Inspection Team. The person in charge of the Department of Livelihood has made an ideological self-criticism of the above errors. The leadership of the Department of Livelihood should bear the main responsibility for the occurrence of the above errors. In addition to submitting the self-criticism to the Ministry of Railways for punishment as a warning, they have immediately taken measures to correct the errors. The content of the self-criticism and future operational measures are described below:

Self-Criticism on Illegal Timber Operations

    1. The head of the Department of Livelihood is responsible for the Shengji Lumber Mill, which is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Livelihood, for purchasing logs from the Northeast. According to the notification issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on January 6, 1950, that all departments and affiliated enterprises in Guannei (areas south of Shanhaiguan) should not purchase timber in the Northeast in the future, the Department of Livelihood should have known and complied with this. However, in order to seek profits, the Department of Livelihood disregarded the policy and not only purchased timber through private merchants but also sent personnel to be stationed in the Northeast, which is wrong and illegal. This kind of behavior, which only considers local interests and ignores national laws, is very harmful to the overall national interests. According to statistics at the time of inspection, a total of more than 6,000 cubic meters of timber were transported into Guannei, and more than 5,000 cubic meters of these timber have been sold (including 2,169 cubic meters extracted by the Department of Livelihood), and the prices were all higher than the listed prices; although it was not the leader in raising prices, it was enough to fuel the fluctuation of the timber market, and the leadership of the Department of Livelihood must bear full responsibility for this. The Department of Livelihood and its affiliated Shengji Lumber Mill had not thoroughly inspected the purchase and sale of timber in connection with the policy in the past, so they failed to discover and correct errors in time. In the future, we must implement government laws and regulations 100%.

    2. The Shengji Lumber Mill has exceeded its business scope in its operations, buying and selling timber, but the Department of Livelihood has not stopped it, which violates the regulations of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. The Department of Livelihood extracted 2,169 cubic meters of logs purchased by the factory from the Northeast, although the original intention was to control it, it was actually sold back to the factory. The above two actions not only violate the state's decision on timber management, but also violate the regulations that government agencies and schools shall not engage in commercial activities. In terms of operating methods, it often goes through private merchants, giving private merchants the opportunity to speculate and profit, which is very wrong. After the inspection team came to the factory for inspection and pointed out this error, we absolutely need to conduct an ideological self-criticism.

    3. It is true that freight car numbers were given to merchants. Among them, thirteen freight cars were privately requested from private merchants in the Northeast by purchasing agents. Another sixty freight cars were requested by Yuan Shicai, the factory director of the Shengji Lumber Mill, and Hao Diankai, the deputy section chief of the enterprise section of the Department of Livelihood, from the office after writing a certificate, saying that the private merchants had already submitted the consignment request (actually not submitted), and that as long as it was proved that the batch of timber was public-owned, the freight cars could be allocated in advance. Therefore, according to the situation they reflected, the office wrote a letter of certification to the Qiqihar Railway Bureau of the Northeast in the name of the office. This letter was handed over by Yuan Shicai, the factory director of the lumber mill, and Xu Zhiguo, the manager, to Yu Shaoliang, the partner of the private merchant Ge Bochuan, and taken to the Northeast to Guo Zhenghai, the purchasing agent in the Northeast, and Xu Zhiguo wrote a letter to Guo Zhenghai asking him to handle the matter of requesting freight cars. After self-criticism, it has been recognized that since the purchase contract stated that the delivery should be made in Beijing, the private merchant should handle the freight cars himself, and the office should not write a letter of certification again. At the same time, the factory should not fail to handle the matter according to the original reflected situation, but instead write a letter asking the purchasing agent in the Northeast to request freight cars (this issue is currently being investigated by this office). The incident of requesting freight cars not only affected the transportation of major materials, but also violated railway regulations.

Future Operational Measures

    1. Immediately stop purchasing timber in the Northeast. If the timber that has already been purchased in the Northeast has not been transported, please ask the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee for instructions on how to handle it; if it has been loaded into freight cars, please ask the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for instructions on how to handle it after it is transported to Beijing.

    2. All existing timber in the Shengji Lumber Mill shall be suspended from use (except for 1,500 cubic meters of construction timber belonging to the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Railways), and properly kept pending instructions from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.

    3. It is determined that the lumber mill shall not exceed the business scope of processing lumber stipulated by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in the future.

    4. The lumber mill shall concentrate its efforts on rectifying its internal affairs before the existing problems are resolved.

    5. In the future, in terms of processing lumber, we should improve technology and save timber.

    6. Organize relevant units to study the government's laws and policies, strictly implement them, and send letters to all railway administration bureaus and livelihood enterprises to study them in order to raise vigilance.

The leaders of the Department of Livelihood went to the Shengji Lumber Mill on August 18 to convene a meeting and made a special report on the above self-criticism and measures. On August 21, they also notified all departments, directly affiliated stores, and affiliated units within the department to study the Government Administration Council's instructions on saving timber, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council's notification on January 6, 1950, that all departments and affiliated enterprises in Guannei shall not purchase timber in the Northeast in the future, so that every employee can understand the seriousness of this error from an ideological perspective and learn from it. Currently, the inspection team formed by the Ministry of Railways is also conducting a thorough inspection of these issues and assisting in education.

    铁道部生计处对违法经营木材的检讨
    中央人民政府铁道部生计处与所属生记制材厂非法经营木材的错误事实，经木材联合检查组检查后，生计处负责人对以上错误从思想上做了检讨。生计处领导方面对以上错误的发生应负主要责任，除将检讨呈报铁道部请求给予处分以资警惕外，并已立即进行纠正。兹将检讨内容及今后在经营上的措施分述如后：
    对非法经营木材的检讨
    1、生计处所属生记制材厂向东北采购原木，生计处负责人应负责任。按生记制材厂是在一九五○年八月份正式开工的，政务院财政经济委员会关于关内各部门及所属企业今后不得在东北采购木材的通知，是在一九五○年一月六日发出的，生计处应当知道并遵照执行。但生计处为了谋求利润，不顾政策，不但通过私商而且派员常驻东北购买木材，这是不应该的，是违法的。这种只顾局部利益，忽视国家法令的行为，对整个国家利益是有很大损害的。到检查时统计，前后共运进关内木材六千余立方公尺，这些木材已售出五千余立方公尺（其中包括生计处提取的二千一百六十九立方公尺），且价格均高于牌价；虽不是带头提高价格，但亦足以助长木材市场波动，这一点生计处领导方面要负完全责任。生计处及所属生记制材厂以往没有联系政策对买卖木材做过彻底检查，所以没有能及时发现错误，改正错误，今后要百分之百地贯彻执行政府法令。
    2、生记制材厂在经营上已超越自己的业务范围，买卖木材，而生计处却未加制止，这是违反工商局规定的。生计处提取该厂由东北买回的原木二千一百六十九立方公尺，虽然原来是想掌握，但实际又出售给该厂。以上两种行为不但违反国家对木材管理的决定，而且又违反机关、学校不得经营商业的规定。在经营方式上，又往往是通过私商，给私商以投机牟利的机会，这是非常错误的。经过检查小组来厂检查，指出这种错误。我们完全有必要从思想上进行检讨。
    3、给商人要车皮，确有此事，其中十三个车皮是采购员私自在东北给私商要的。另六十个车皮，是经过生记制材厂厂长苑士才与生计处企业课副课长郝殿凯向处方要求写证明书，并说私商早将托运请求书递上（实际未递），只要证明这批木材是公家的，便可提前拨给车皮。所以处方根据他们所反映的情况，以处的名义给东北齐齐哈尔铁路局写了一封证明信。此信由制材厂厂长苑士才与经理徐治国共同交给私商葛伯川的伙计于绍良带到东北交给东北采购员郭正海，并由徐治国给郭正海写了一封信叫他办理要车皮的事。经检讨后，已认识到：订购合同上既注明在北京交货，车皮自应由私商自己办理，处方就不应再写证明信，同时厂方更不应不照原反映情况办理，反而又写信叫东北采购员给要车皮（这个问题本处正在追究责任中）。要车皮这件事，不但影响了主要物资的运输，而且违反了铁路规章。
    今后在经营中的措施
    1、立即停止在东北采购木材，现在东北已购妥的木材如未运，请示东北财政经济委员会处理；如已装车，运到北京后请示政务院财政经济委员会处理。
    2、生记制材厂现有的木材一律暂停动用（其中有属于铁道部总务处的一千五百立方公尺建筑木材除外），妥善保管听候政务院财政经济委员会处理。
    3、确定制材厂今后不准超越工商局规定的加工制材的营业范围。
    4、制材厂在现存问题解决以前集中力量整顿内部。
    5、今后在加工制材方面，应提高技术，做到节约木材。
    6、组织有关单位学习政府的法令政策，严格执行，并分函转知各铁路管理局生计企业单位学习，以资提高警惕。
    生计处领导人已于八月十八日赴生记制材厂将上述检讨及措施在该厂召集会议，作了专题报告，八月二十一日并通知处内各课、直属商店及所属各单位学习政务院关于节约木材的指示，及一九五○年一月六日政务院财政经济委员会关于关内各部门及所属企业今后不得在东北采购木材的通知，使每一职工从思想上认识这一错误的严重性，引为教训。目前铁道部所组成的检查组亦正对这些问题作彻底检查，协助进行教育。
    中央人民政府铁道部生计处  九月十一日
