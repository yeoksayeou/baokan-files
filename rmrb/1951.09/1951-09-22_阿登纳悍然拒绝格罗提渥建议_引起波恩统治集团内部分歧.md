　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th September: Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic,’s statement on September 15th, and the People’s Chamber's proposal to the West German "Federal Assembly" on the same day regarding the convening of an all-German conference to discuss the issue of holding all-German elections, has caused serious panic and division within the Bonn ruling clique.
　　The Adenauer "government" rejected Grotewohl and the People's Chamber's proposal with an arrogant attitude. On the 15th, a spokesman for the Bonn "government" stated that the proposal from the German Democratic Republic was "impossible" to realize. On the 18th, Adenauer himself delivered a radio address, brazenly expressing his opposition to the People's Chamber's proposal.
　　This action by the Adenauer government not only directly violated the wishes of the vast majority of the West German people, but also aroused serious dissatisfaction among a section of the West German bourgeoisie. Adenauer's radio address was originally scheduled to be delivered on the 17th, but, according to Reuters, the arrogant and crude content of the speech "surprised many within his own Christian Democratic Party." As a result, Adenauer had to withdraw the recorded speech a few minutes before the broadcast, deleting a portion of the shameless slander against the Soviet Union, and released it the next day.
　　According to the Austrian "Evening News," the Adenauer government is now in a very unfavorable position due to its brazen rejection of the People's Chamber's proposal. When Adenauer brazenly rejected Premier Grotewohl's proposal of November 30th last year and the People's Chamber's proposal of January 30th this year regarding the establishment of an all-German constitutional assembly in January and March of this year, his excuse was the requirement to hold universal, direct, and secret all-German elections first. Now, there is a definite similarity between the People's Chamber's proposal on holding all-German elections and the conditions previously put forward by Adenauer. In this regard, the leaders of the Bonn government do not know how to explain their decision to reject this new proposal to the German people.
　　The Austrian "Evening News" also pointed out that Adenauer's response has caused divisions within the Bonn ruling clique. Some political leaders and members of parliament have also expressed doubts about the government's policy. They support the People's Chamber's proposal and advocate holding all-German elections to prevent the situation from developing in a more dangerous direction.
　　Many bourgeois newspapers in West Germany and West Berlin have also expressed strong dissatisfaction with Adenauer's response and welcomed Grotewohl's statement and the People's Chamber's proposal. The editor-in-chief of the West Berlin "Daily Mirror," Legel, severely criticized the attitude of the Bonn government. He particularly pointed out that the Bonn government said that the reunification of Germany should rely on the agreement of the four powers and not be decided by elections, but Adenauer himself had demanded that elections be held. The West Berlin evening newspaper "Express" also wrote: "Who in the world can stop us from at least seriously discussing every real opportunity to reunify Germany? Grotewohl's speech and the People's Chamber's proposal touch on many issues that should be given full consideration. Now is the time when the federal government and the federal parliament urgently need to begin completing valuable domestic policies, thereby creating the necessary conditions for a sound German foreign policy."

### 阿登纳悍然拒绝格罗提渥建议  引起波恩统治集团内部分歧

    阿登纳悍然拒绝格罗提渥建议
    引起波恩统治集团内部分歧
    【新华社二十日讯】德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥于九月十五日所发表的声明和人民议会于同日向西德“联邦议会”所提出的关于召开全德会议以讨论举行全德选举的问题的建议，已在波恩统治集团内部引起了严重的慌乱和分歧。
    阿登纳“政府”以蛮横的态度拒绝了格罗提渥与人民议会的建议。在十五日当天，波恩“政府”的发言人就表示来自德意志民主共和国方面的建议是“不可能”实现的。到十八日，阿登纳又亲自发表广播演说，悍然表示反对人民议会的建议。
    阿登纳政府这种行动不仅直接违反了西德广大人民的愿望，而且也引起了一部分西德资产阶级的严重不满。阿登纳的广播演说本来是决定在十七日发表的，但是，据路透社透露，由于这篇演说内容的横蛮粗暴，“使他自己的基督教民主党内的许多人也吃了一惊”，结果阿登纳不得不把这篇已经录音的演说在临广播前几分钟撤销，删去了其中一部分无耻诬蔑苏联的词句，改在第二天发表。
    据奥地利“晚报”报道：阿登纳政府由于悍然拒绝了人民议会的建议现在已处于非常不利的地位。今年一月间和三月间阿登纳两次悍然拒绝格罗提渥总理于去年十一月三十日和人民议会于今年一月三十日所提出的关于成立全德立宪议会的建议时，其藉口就是要求必须先举行全德的普遍的、直接的、秘密的选举。现在，在人民议会的关于举行全德选举的建议与阿登纳以前所提出的条件之间，有着确定的相同的地方，在这一方面，波恩政府领袖不知如何向德国人民解释他们拒绝这一新建议的决定。
    奥地利“晚报”还指出：阿登纳的回答已经引起了波恩统治集团内部的分歧。一部分政界领袖及议员对于政府方针也表示怀疑，他们赞成人民议会的建议，并主张举行全德选举以免事态向更危险的方向发展。
    西德和西柏林的资产阶级报纸也有许多对于阿登纳的回答深表不满，并对格罗提渥的声明和人民议会的建议表示欢迎。西柏林“每日镜报”的主笔列格尔猛烈抨击波恩政府的态度。他特别指出：波恩政府说：德国的统一要靠四强的协议而不能由选举决定，但是，就是阿登纳本人曾提出过要求举行选举。西柏林的晚报“快报”也写道：“世界上有什么人能够阻止我们至少认真讨论一下每一个重新统一德国的真正机会呢？格罗提渥的演讲和人民议会的建议谈到许多问题，这些问题都应该给予充分的考虑。现在正是迫切需要联邦政府和联邦议会开始完成有价值的对内政策，从而为健全的德国外交政策创造必要条件的时候了。”
