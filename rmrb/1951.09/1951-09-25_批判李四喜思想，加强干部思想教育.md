Criticize Li Sixi's Thought, Strengthen Ideological Education of Cadres
Wang Shoudao

Editor's Note: The New Hunan Daily has launched a discussion on "Li Sixi's Thought" since July 18th, in order to criticize the slack and麻痹 thought that appeared among rural cadres after the land reform. This article by Comrade Wang Shoudao, Second Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, was written to guide this discussion. The so-called "Li Sixi's Thought" exists not only among some rural cadres in Hunan, but also among many cadres in other rural areas where land reform has been completed. These cadres are satisfied with the land they have been given and are unwilling to continue revolutionary work. In order to correct this erroneous thinking, we are reprinting Comrade Wang Shoudao's article here, hoping that readers in various places will pay general attention to it.

Since liberation two years ago, the broad masses of peasants in Hunan, under the leadership and assistance of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, have carried forward the revolutionary tradition of diligence, bravery, and hard struggle of the Hunan people, enabling the movements of suppressing bandits and eliminating local bullies, rent reduction and deposit refunds, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and increasing production and practicing economy to aid Korea and resist America to proceed smoothly and achieve great results. The awareness of the broad masses of peasants has been greatly raised, their living standards have been gradually improved, and the people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside has been increasingly consolidated, opening up broad and bright paths for the great cause of building a new Hunan in the future. However, among some village cadres in areas where land reform has now been completed, a slackening thought represented by Li Sixi has emerged. According to reports from various sources, this is still a common and serious problem in the current rural areas. This thought hinders the development of strengthening the leadership of the working class and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and thus hinders the development of rural work. I believe that the New Hunan Daily's discussion on Li Sixi's thought is timely and necessary. Here, I would like to put forward a few suggestions for discussion with everyone. I hope that rural cadres in various places, especially the leading organs of the Party and government in various places, will also attach importance to the discussion of this thought and publish more specific opinions.

Li Sixi's thought is mainly a kind of slack and麻痹 thought among peasant cadres after the completion of land reform. Li Sixi was a poor peasant who showed great bravery and activeness in the fierce land reform struggle, and was therefore cultivated and promoted to be a village cadre. However, after the completion of land reform, he was allocated land, houses, and the fruits of victory, married a wife, and had a son. He mistakenly believed that the enemy had been defeated and that "the world is at peace and everything is going well." He regarded the completion of land reform as the end of the revolutionary cause, so he was unwilling to work any more, unwilling to serve the masses any more, and demanded to go home to "bury himself in production" and "get rich." In this way, he lost his vigilance against class enemies and lost his direction on the far-reaching future of the revolution. He does not understand that the revolutionary road taken by the Chinese people today is not the road to failure that countless peasant revolutions in Chinese history have ultimately taken, nor is it the road of the old democratic revolution that ultimately left the broad masses of workers and peasants in increasing poverty, unemployment, and suffering; but the bright road of new democracy that will inevitably lead to socialism. Therefore, the broad masses of peasants must, under the guidance of the idea of supporting the leadership of the working class, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and loving the people's motherland, produce more grain, more industrial raw materials, and more goods for export, accumulate capital, so that the country will move towards industrialization, and then turn around to improve agricultural production, implement the mechanization and collectivization of agricultural production, and gradually move from new democracy to socialism. Only by implementing socialism can we finally eliminate all disasters and sufferings and live a more beautiful and happy life, like the Soviet Union, a socialist country today. Therefore, our revolutionary cause has not ended, and the revolutionary tasks in the future are even more arduous, and the future of the country is infinitely bright and far-reaching. Like Li Sixi, being satisfied with the status quo, unwilling to continue to work hard to strive for a better future, only seeing the current personal interests, burying himself in production, not caring about national affairs, and not asking about politics, this selfish and backward slack thought is obviously wrong and harmful.

As long as we correctly understand the current situation, we will know that our work must not have the slightest slackness and麻痹. After the completion of land reform, although the landlord class has been overthrown, the remaining feudal forces still exist. If we "bury ourselves," the enemy will raise their heads; if we relax and do not work, the enemy will take the opportunity to move. At present, in many areas where land reform has been completed, it has been found that illegal landlords collude with bad elements to carry out counter-attacks, disperse property, create rumors, and provoke dissension between cadres and the masses. This is a problem that must be paid serious attention to. American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and all domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces will never be reconciled to defeat. They are doing everything possible to undermine the victory of the Chinese people. The reactionary head of American imperialism, Truman, has no sincerity in the negotiations on the Korean armistice, deliberately delaying and sabotaging them, and concluding a separate peace with Japan and rearming Japan, seriously threatening the peace and security of China and the world. American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the landlord class are all colluding with each other and are enemies of the people. To defend their own liberation interests, the broad masses of peasants must defend the motherland, defend world peace, and unite with the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world to thoroughly overthrow American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the remaining feudal forces, and all domestic and foreign reactionaries who oppress, exploit, and harm the Chinese people. As long as the enemy exists for one day, we cannot stop fighting them for one day. Only in this way can the peasants obtain permanent and true liberation, and can they produce and get rich freely and safely. Like Li Sixi, believing that the enemy has been overthrown from now on, the world is at peace, and work can be stopped, thus losing revolutionary vigilance and fighting will, disarming himself, and giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of, this麻痹 and complacent thought of peace is obviously wrong and harmful.

Li Sixi's thought is by no means unique to Li Sixi. This is a kind of narrow, selfish, and backward thought of small private producers formed by Chinese peasants under the long-term decentralized small-scale peasant economy production method. The reason why this kind of thought can grow is that, on the one hand, Li Sixi's own political study is not enough, his awareness is not high, and he has not carried out strict ideological struggle to overcome it in time; at the same time, on the other hand, it reflects that many county and district cadres have neglected the ideological education of village cadres and have not paid attention to improving the leadership methods of village cadres. They do not understand the important significance of strengthening political and ideological education, and are accustomed to using the method of shock work to carry out work, and are not good at inspiring and raising the ideological awareness of the masses in their work. They are often satisfied with completing tasks in form and numbers at one time and in one place, neglecting the political purpose and long-term interests of various tasks, and are not good at connecting various tasks with the general line and general policy of the revolution to educate village cadres. At the same time, they only require village cadres to complete heavy work tasks, but do not specifically guide and help them solve various difficulties in their work; when village cadres make some mistakes in their work, they cannot patiently educate, persuade, and help them correct them, but simply criticize and accuse them; they also lack due consideration and care for their family life and production difficulties. All of this makes them feel that "it is not worth the effort" and that they are "suffering from three sides" (criticized by leaders, criticized by the masses, and criticized by their wives at home), and that "it is better to quit early."

In order to overcome the erroneous thoughts of village cadres and rectify the ranks of village cadres, we must conscientiously criticize Li Sixi's thought, and educate Li Sixi himself and all cadres and the masses from the criticism. In the future, Party and government at all levels must attach importance to the ideological education of cadres, especially paying attention to the education of village cadres. In various struggles, cadres must be given systematic and regular education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and putting the interests of the revolution first. Communist Party members and cadres should also be given communist ideological education to establish the determination and confidence to fight to the end for the cause of communism. It is hoped that Party and government at all levels will do the following three tasks well in the future and form a system: First, within a certain period of time, check the ideological situation of cadres and carry out systematic ideological education work in light of this ideological situation. Second, improve the leadership methods for village cadres, fully understand the various difficulties in their work, and give specific leadership and assistance. In the work, we must constantly inspire and guide their ideological awareness and enthusiasm, and constantly cultivate their work ability. It is wrong to treat them as a "tool to run errands," and it is also wrong to simply assign tasks to them. In particular, we must oppose the bureaucratic attitude of coercion, commandism, accusation, and scolding towards them. Third, it is necessary to solve the various difficulties in the lives of village cadres, such as raising their salaries if they are too low, and organizing local farmers to help each other if their families are in difficulty and lack labor. In this way, we can comprehensively and thoroughly overcome Li Sixi's thought.

Although Li Sixi's thought is not the majority among all cadres, it is a common problem. Its harm to the revolutionary cause is very great. The village government is the grassroots organization of the people's government, and the village cadres are the leaders and executors of the village government. They are the bridge between the Party and the government and the masses, and they are the backbone of the masses. Therefore, we must not ignore them. It is hoped that the leading organs of the Party and government at all levels, local newspapers, rural cadres, and the broad masses of peasants will conduct in-depth discussions on this issue. The method of convening cadres to discuss Li Sixi's thought in Xiangyin, Wangcheng, and other counties recently is worth learning. We must raise the ideological awareness and work enthusiasm of the peasant masses and village cadres from the struggle to criticize this erroneous thinking, so as to achieve the purpose of strengthening revolutionary unity and improving rural work.

    批判李四喜思想，加强干部思想教育
    王首道
    编者按：新湖南报从七月十八日起展开了关于“李四喜思想”的讨论，借以批判在土地改革后出现在农村干部中的松懈麻痹思想。中共湖南省委第二书记、湖南省人民政府主席王首道同志的这篇论文，就是为了指导这次讨论而写的。所谓“李四喜思想”不但存在于湖南的一部分农村干部中，而且也存在于土地改革完成了的其他农村的许多干部中。这些干部分了土地就心满意足，不愿意继续做革命工作了。为了纠正这种错误思想，我们把王首道同志的论文转载在这里，希望各地读者普遍加以注意。
    解放两年来，湖南的广大农民，在各级党委与人民政府的领导与帮助下，发扬了湖南人民勤劳勇敢、艰苦奋斗的革命传统，使剿匪反霸、减租退押、土地改革、镇压反革命和抗美援朝爱国增产等运动，得以顺利进行，并获得很大成绩。广大农民的觉悟大大提高，生活逐步改善，农村的人民民主专政日益巩固起来，为今后建设新湖南的伟大事业开辟了广阔的光明的道路。但是在现在已土地改革地区的一部分乡村干部中，产生了一种以李四喜为代表的松气思想。据各方面的反映，这在当前农村中还是一个带有普遍性的严重问题。这种思想阻碍着加强工人阶级领导和巩固工农联盟思想的发展，因而阻碍着农村工作的发展。我认为新湖南报展开李四喜思想的讨论，是适时的，必要的。在这里，我提出几点意见，和大家讨论。我希望各地农村干部，特别是各地党与政府的领导机关也重视这一个思想的讨论，发表更多的具体意见。
    李四喜思想，主要是土地改革完成后，农民干部的一种松气麻痹思想。李四喜是一个贫苦农民，在激烈的土地改革斗争中，表现得很勇敢积极，因而被培养提拔成为乡干部。但到土地改革完成后，分得了土地、房屋和胜利果实，娶了亲，生了儿子，便错误地认为敌人已经打倒了，“天下太平，万事大吉”。他把土地改革的完成看成革命事业的完结，于是不愿再做工作，不愿再为群众服务，要求回家“埋头生产”，“发家致富”。这样，他就对阶级敌人丧失了警惕性，对革命的远大前途迷失方向。他不了解今天中国人民所走的革命道路，已不是中国历史上无数次农民革命最后走向失败的道路，也不是旧民主主义革命使广大工农群众最后仍陷于日益贫困失业痛苦的道路；而是新民主主义的必然要走向社会主义的光明道路。因此，广大农民必须在以拥护工人阶级领导、巩固工农联盟、热爱人民祖国的思想指导下，多生产粮食，多生产工业原料，多生产外销物资，积累资本，使国家走向工业化，然后反转过来再提高农业生产，实行农业生产的机械化和集体化，逐步从新民主主义走向社会主义。只有实行社会主义，才能最后解除一切灾难和痛苦，过更美满幸福的生活，像今天社会主义国家的苏联一样。因此，我们的革命事业并未完结，今后的革命任务更加艰巨，国家的前途是无限光明远大的。像李四喜那样，满足了现状，不愿继续努力工作去争取更美好的将来，只看到目前的个人利益，埋头生产，不关心国家大事，不过问政治，这种自私落后的松气思想，显然是错误的，有害的。
    只要正确认识目前情况，就知道我们的工作必然不能有丝毫松懈和麻痹。在土地改革完成后，地主阶级虽然被打倒，但封建残余势力仍然存在。如果我们“埋头”时，敌人就抬头了；我们放松不干工作，敌人就乘机活动了。目前已有不少土地改革完成的地区，发现有不法地主勾结坏分子，进行反攻倒算、疏散财产、制造谣言和挑拨离间干部与群众团结等等事件，这是必须引起严重注意的问题。美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮及一切国内外反革命势力，他们是绝不甘心失败的，他们正在千方百计地破坏中国人民的胜利。美帝国主义的反动头子杜鲁门，对朝鲜停战的谈判毫无诚意，故意拖延破坏，对日单独媾和，重新武装日本，严重地威胁着中国与世界的和平与安全。美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和地主阶级，他们都是串通一气与人民为敌的，广大农民要保卫自己的翻身利益，必须保卫祖国，保卫世界和平，联合全国人民和全世界人民，彻底地打倒压迫剥削残害中国人民的美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮、封建残余势力和一切国内外反动派。只要敌人存在一天，我们就要一天也不能停止和他们作斗争。只有这样，农民才能得到永久的真正的翻身，才能自由安全的生产发家。像李四喜那样，认为敌人从此打倒了，天下太平了，工作可以不干了，因而丧失了革命的警惕性与斗争意志，解除了自己的武装，给敌人以可乘之机，这种麻痹轻敌的太平思想，显然是错误的，有害的。
    李四喜思想绝不是李四喜个人所特有的。这是中国农民处在长期分散的小农经济的生产方式下，所养成的一种小私有生产者的狭隘、自私的落后思想。这种思想其所以能够滋长，一方面是由于李四喜自己的政治学习不够，觉悟不高，没有进行严格的思想斗争，及时予以克服；同时，另一方面却反映了我们不少县区干部忽视了对乡村干部的思想教育工作，和不注意改进对乡村干部的领导方法。他们不了解加强政治思想教育的重要意义，习惯于用突击工作方式来进行工作，而不善于在工作中启发与提高群众的思想觉悟。他们往往满足于一时一地在形式上数字上完成任务，忽视各项工作的政治目的与长远利益，不善于将各项工作与革命的总路线总方针联系起来去教育乡村干部。同时，他们只要求乡村干部去完成繁重的工作任务，而不去具体指导和帮助他们解决各种工作中的困难；当乡村干部在工作中犯了一些错误时，又不能耐心地进行教育说服帮助改正，只是单纯地批评指责；对他们的家庭生活和生产困难，也缺乏应有的体贴关怀和照顾。所有这些，就使他们感到“费力不讨好”，“三头受气”（领导批评，群众批评，回家老婆也批评），“不如早日下场”。
    为了克服乡村干部的错误思想，整顿乡村干部的队伍，我们要认真进行对李四喜思想的批判，从批判中教育李四喜本人和全体干部与群众。各级党与政府，今后必须重视对干部的思想教育工作，特别是注意教育乡村干部。要在各种斗争中，对干部进行系统的、经常的马列主义和毛泽东思想的教育，确立干部全心全意为人民服务和革命利益第一的思想，对党员干部还要进行共产主义的思想教育，以确立为共产主义事业奋斗到底的决心和信心。希望各级党与政府今后作好下面三项工作，并形成制度：第一，要在一定的时期内，检查干部的思想情况，并针对这种思想情况进行系统的思想教育工作。第二，要改善对乡村干部的领导方法，要充分了解他们工作中的各种困难，给以具体的领导和帮助。在工作中要不断地启发和诱导他们的思想觉悟与积极性，经常培养他们的工作能力。把他们当作一个“跑腿”的工具是不对的，单纯的压任务也是不对的，尤其要反对对他们采取强迫命令、指责谩骂的官僚主义态度。第三，必须对乡村干部生活上的各种困难，如待遇太低的，要在可能条件下予以提高，家庭困难缺乏劳动力的，要组织当地农民互助。这样，才能全面地彻底地克服李四喜思想。
    李四喜思想虽然在全体干部中还不是多数，却是带有普遍性的问题。它对革命事业的危害性是很大的。乡村政权是人民政权的基层组织，乡村干部是乡村政权的领导者与执行者，他们是党与政府联系群众的桥梁，是群众中的骨干，因此，我们决不能忽视。希望各级党与政府的领导机关，各地报纸、农村干部以及广大农民群众对这一问题深入展开讨论。最近湘阴、望城等县召集干部讨论李四喜思想的办法，是值得学习的。要从展开批判这种错误的思想斗争中提高农民群众和乡村干部的思想觉悟和工作积极性，以达到加强革命的团结、改进农村工作的目的。（原载八月二十五日新湖南报）
