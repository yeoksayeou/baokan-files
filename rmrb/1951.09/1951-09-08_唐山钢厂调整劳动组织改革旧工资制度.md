Tangshan Steel Plant Adjusts Labor Organization and Reforms Old Wage System
    Tangshan Steel Plant, accepting Soviet experience, increased replacement workers and implemented a rotational rest system, rationally adjusting the labor organization. This has regularized production competitions and provided favorable conditions for reforming the old wage system.
    The Previous Labor Organization Was Unreasonable
        There Was a Great Waste of Labor
    Before February of this year, the plant's labor organization was unreasonable. The work types throughout the plant were confused, and the job titles were vague. Although the workshops had a distinction between skilled workers, ordinary workers, trainee workers, and apprentices, it could not adapt to the diversity and complexity of the actual work, so workers had no specific responsibilities in their work. For example, when tapping steel in the steelmaking department, skilled work such as shaking the furnace and sampling was not the responsibility of a specific person. This often led to everyone doing it randomly, affecting the quality of the steel. Ten percent of the plant's skilled workers were doing ordinary and trainee worker jobs, seriously wasting skilled labor, while workshop cadres often complained, "The tasks are heavy, and there are too few people." In the rolling mill department, a production team was divided into two small shifts, taking turns resting every hour, greatly wasting labor. At the same time, workshops such as rolling and steelmaking had two shifts of workers working overtime every Sunday. This overtime work greatly damaged the workers' health.
    Due to the above-mentioned unreasonable labor organization, when the plant focused on conducting labor time studies with the help of Soviet experts in January of this year, it was discovered that there was a significant waste of labor. During the eight-hour workday, the average actual working time for workers was only four hours and forty minutes.
    Increasing Replacement Workers and Implementing Rotational Rest System
            Rationally Adjusted the Labor Organization
    This situation immediately attracted the attention of the plant's leaders. Therefore, from February to April, the plant adjusted its labor organization. During the adjustment, the plant mobilized workers to discuss the drawbacks of the original labor organization based on the technical standards stipulated by the Central Bureau of Iron and Steel Industry, and studied the Soviet experience of increasing replacement workers and implementing a rotational rest system. Soviet experts also personally went to the electric furnace workshop to form a temporary production team according to Soviet experience and conducted experiments. After this work, the unnecessary ideological concerns of the workers were dispelled, and the workers were mobilized. Each unit determined each person's specific job title and the number of personnel in each unit's establishment according to the technical standards, measuring the actual skills that everyone should know and be able to do, and combined with the actual work needs. Before the adjustment of the labor organization, the plant originally planned to add 150 more workers to implement rotational rest. After the adjustment, not only was no additional manpower needed, but 148 people were reduced from the original total number of workers. Among these 148 people, in addition to ten people who left the factory for various reasons, the rest were assigned as replacement workers and reserve workers to implement a rotational rest system in each workshop. The method of increasing replacement workers was to add one replacement worker to each production team of six people, so that every worker in the team could take a day off each week in rotation. Production teams with fewer than six people could combine with small groups in the same workshop with similar production work to jointly increase replacement workers; if there were no small groups with similar production work, reserve workers would be added. In addition to working as replacement workers, reserve workers also undertake temporary work in the workshop. The replacement method for replacement workers is determined according to the complexity of production technology. For example, in the technically complex electric furnace workshop, higher-level workers replace lower-level workers; in the relatively simple converter and rolling mill workshops, lower-level workers replace higher-level workers. Higher-level workers only do lower-level work for one day a week, which has no major impact on production, and it also helps lower-level workers learn technology when replacing higher-level workers.
    Production Competitions Are Regularized After Adjustment
        Saving Labor and Improving Quality
    After adjusting the labor organization, the phenomenon of workers working overtime every Sunday in the plant has disappeared, thus saving overtime pay of more than 16,500 jin of millet per month. Workers have had adequate rest, and the number of sick workers has also decreased by a quarter compared to before. Because the method of changing the original Sunday night shift to a day shift and stopping the eight-hour night shift work for shift changes was eliminated, eight hours of production time were added each week. The steelmaking workers in the steelmaking department, because they had specific responsibilities, actively studied and improved operating methods. They moved the work of mixing magnesite when repairing the furnace from a distance to the furnace mouth, and changed from mixing while repairing to mixing in advance during work interruptions. As a result, not only was a labor force for mixing magnesite saved, but the furnace repair time was also reduced from 25 to 30 minutes to 20 minutes. Therefore, the labor consumption rate per ton of steel ingot in the department in May decreased by 5% compared to April, and it overfulfilled the monthly task by 26%, and the scrap rate also decreased from 9% to 2%. Although the department's task in June increased by 9% compared to May, it still overfulfilled the task, and the scrap rate was further reduced to 1.2%. In July, the plant's main products all overfulfilled their tasks, and the average scrap rate dropped to 1.1%.

    After Tangshan Steel Plant reformed the old wage system and implemented the eight-grade wage system, the workers' production enthusiasm and enthusiasm for studying technology significantly improved.
    The Old Wage System Had Egalitarian Phenomena
        Hindering Workers' Enthusiasm to Improve Technology
    Although the plant had adjusted wages many times after liberation, it had never fundamentally reformed the wage system until the beginning of this year. As a result, the phenomena of egalitarianism and upside-down importance in the old wage system still existed. The plant had as many as 176 wage grades, and the difference between each grade was only five jin or even half a jin or four liang of millet. The situation of upside-down importance was that the wages of auxiliary workers (mechanical and electrical repair workers) were higher than the wages of basic workers (steelmaking and rolling workers), and the workers actually engaged in steelmaking and rolling were called trainee workers because their job titles were not determined, and they received wages lower than those of miscellaneous workers. In addition, workers living in the factory (mechanical and electrical repair workers) not only did not pay rent and utilities, but also received 250 kilograms of coal per month, while workers living outside the factory did not receive any subsidies. These unreasonable phenomena in the old wage system seriously hindered the enthusiasm of the workers to improve their technology and made some workers feel uneasy about their work. For example, Liu Yongshun, an electric furnace technician, requested to be transferred to work as a mechanical and electrical worker because his wages on the electric furnace were not as high as in the mechanical and electrical department. Some workers were even more dissatisfied and said, "It's the same whether the technology improves or not. It's only a few jin of rice to move up a grade."
    Democratically Assess Wages According to the Eight-Grade Wage System
            Workers Work Contentedly and Actively Improve Technology
    Therefore, with the approval of the higher authorities, the plant began to reform the old wage system in February of this year. From February to April was the preparation stage. During this stage, the labor organization was adjusted, and the job titles were specifically determined. From May to July, wages were assessed according to the eight-grade wage system. In the reform work, the plant first formed a two-level wage assessment committee composed of party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres from the factory and workshops, and absorbed technical personnel and workers to study the new wage policy and study the problems in the old wage system to unify the thinking of the cadres. Then, the benefits of the new wage system and the disadvantages of the old wage system were widely publicized among the workers. At the same time, the factory wage assessment committee formulated specific technical standards and gave them to the workers for discussion. Then, democratic wage assessment was carried out. The specific method of democratic wage assessment was that the workshop wage assessment committee first determined the technical grade of each worker according to the technical standards. After discussion by the workers, the factory wage assessment committee revised and approved it according to the opinions discussed by the workers, and finally determined their technical grade and determined their wage points.
    The result of implementing the eight-grade wage system was that not only was the difference between each grade increased to 20 to 30 jin of millet, but also 92% of the workers increased their wages, while the total wage amount only increased by 15%. Because each worker has determined the appropriate job title and wage grade, and the grade difference is relatively large, not only have workers who requested to change their jobs no longer requested transfers and are content with their original work, but also the workers have generally increased their enthusiasm for studying technology. The "Resist America, Aid Korea" electric furnace workers used to build magnesite brick furnace walls without baking the furnace bricks, which often caused the magnesite bricks to peel off, affecting the quality of the steel. After the wage reform, they actively studied technology and learned the Soviet method of baking furnace bricks first. As a result, not only was the life of the furnace increased by nearly 10%, but the quality of the steel was also increased by 9%. The technical research association of the foundry department often could not hold meetings in the past because workers were absent for no reason. Now, they are held once a week, and the workers actively participate. After focusing on reducing waste products in July, the department's waste product rate has dropped from 8.3% to 1.5%. The first-grade products in rolling and steelmaking have also increased by 9.2% compared to before the wage reform due to the workers' active improvement of technology.
        One of the Keys to the Smooth Completion of Wage Reform
            Was to Thoroughly Mobilize the Masses Ideologically
    The key to the successful completion of the plant's wage reform was, first, to adjust the labor organization and determine the job titles, and second, to promptly solve the problems of the workers' ideological situation and thoroughly mobilize the masses. Because the job titles were specifically determined before the wage assessment, there was no phenomenon of arbitrarily requesting excessively high wage grades during the wage assessment. When the plant submitted the formulated technical standards of the plant to the workers for discussion, due to the limitation of the workers' cultural level, some work could be done but the scientific principles behind it were not understood, so many workers were dissatisfied with the "should know" item stipulated in the technical standards and said, "Don't assess it! It's no good if you have a low cultural level!" The wages of mechanical and electrical repair workers were to be changed to be lower than the wages of steelmaking and rolling workers according to the new wage industry order. Some mechanical and electrical repair workers were also dissatisfied and said:
    "Yesterday we were higher than them, but today we are not as good as them! If we can't get along here, we can move and do the same job elsewhere." The factory wage assessment committee promptly decided that those who "fully know how to do it" and "only know more than half of what they should know" would not be downgraded, and explained to the workers through factory propagandists that the responsibilities of steelmaking and rolling workers were relatively large, and the new wage industry order was reasonable. This finally removed the ideological obstacles and enabled the wage reform work to proceed smoothly.
    In addition, in the wage assessment work, the plant's CCP branch, labor union, and youth league mobilized party and league members to sign wage assessment pledges to ensure that the assessment was based on technical standards and that they would not raise each other's grades. This was also a reason for the smooth completion of the wage reform work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    唐山钢厂调整劳动组织改革旧工资制度
    唐山钢厂接受苏联的经验，增加替换工，实行轮流休息制，合理调整了劳动组织，从而使生产竞赛经常化，并为改革旧工资制度提供了有利条件。
    过去劳动组织不合理
        劳动力有很大的浪费
    该厂的劳动组织在今年二月以前是不合理的。全厂工种混乱，职称笼统，各车间虽有技工、普通工、养成工和学徒之分，但与实际工作的多样性和复杂性却不能适应，以致工人们在工作中没有专责。如炼钢部出钢时摇炉、取样等技工工作无专人负责，经常大伙乱下手，影响钢的质量。全厂有百分之十的技工，常干普通工和养成工活，严重浪费了技工劳动力，而车间干部却常喊“任务大，人少”。轧钢部一个生产组分成两个小班，每隔一小时即轮流休息一次，大大浪费了劳动力；同时，轧钢、炼钢等车间每星期日却有两班工人实行加班。这种加班使工人健康受到很大损害。
    由于上述劳动组织的不合理，今年一月份该厂在苏联专家帮助下重点进行劳动测定时，即发现劳动力的浪费很大，在八小时工作中，工人实际劳动时间平均只有四点四十分钟。
    增加替换工实行轮休制
            合理地调整了劳动组织
    这一情况当即引起该厂领导干部的重视，于是在二至四月份该厂调整了劳动组织。在调整中，该厂曾发动工人根据中央钢铁工业局规定的技术标准，讨论原来劳动组织中的弊端，并学习了苏联增加替换工，实行轮流休息制的经验。苏联专家还亲至电炉场，按苏联经验组成临时生产组，进行试验。经过这一些工作，工人群众若干不必要的思想顾虑解除了，工人群众发动起来了。各单位根据技术标准衡量了每个人实际应知应会的工作技能，并结合实际工作需要，确定了每个人的具体职称和各单位的编制人数。调整劳动组织前，该厂原计划再增加一百五十名工人才能实行轮流休息，调整后，不但不再增加，还从原来工人总数中缩减了一百四十八人。这一百四十八人中，除了十人因故离厂外，其余都被编为替换工和预备工，以便在各车间实行轮流休息制。增加替换工的办法是在每六人的生产组中增加一个替换工，使全组每一个工人在一周内都能轮流休息一天。不足六人的生产组，可与同车间生产工作相似的小组合起来，联合增加替换工；如无生产工作相似的小组，便增加预备工。预备工除作替换工外，并在车间担任临时工作。替换工的替换方法，是根据生产技术的复杂性来决定的。如技术复杂的电炉场，就采用高一级的工人替换低一级工人的方法；技术比较单纯的转炉、轧钢场，就采用低一级的工人替换高一级工人的方法。高一级的工人每周只作一天低一级的工作，对生产固无大的影响，而低一级的工人替换高一级工人的工作，在学习技术方面也有很大帮助。
    调整后生产竞赛经常化
        节省了劳力提高了质量
    调整劳动组织后，该厂工人每星期日加班的现象已没有，因之每月即节省加班费达一万六千五百余斤小米。工人们有了适当休息，病号也较前减少了四分之一。由于原来每星期日夜班改为白班工作而停止夜班八小时工作以便倒班的办法被革除，每周就增加了八小时的生产时间。炼钢部的炼钢工人因为有了专责，便积极研究改进操作方法，将过去补炉时搅拌镁砂的工作由远处移到炉口，由一面补一面搅拌改成利用工作中断时间事先拌好，结果不但节省了一个搅拌镁砂的劳动力，且使补炉时间由二十五至三十分钟减到了二十分钟。因此，该部五月份每吨钢锭的用工率即较四月份减少了百分之五，并超额百分之二十六完成了全月任务，废品率也由百分之九降低到百分之二。六月份该部任务虽较五月份增加了百分之九，但仍然超额完成，并使废品率再度降低至百分之一点二。全厂七月份主要产品都超额完成任务，废品率平均降至百分之一点一。

                ★★★
    唐山钢厂改革旧工资制度并实行八级工资制后，工人生产热情与研究技术的积极性显著提高。
    旧工资制度有平均主义现象
        妨碍工人提高技术的积极性
    该厂解放后虽曾多次调整工资，但直到今年年初，从未对工资制度进行根本的改革，以致旧工资制度中的平均主义、轻重倒置的现象仍然存在。全厂工资等级多达一百七十六级，各级差额只有五斤甚至半斤、四两小米。轻重倒置的情形是辅助工（机电修理工）工资高于基本工（炼钢、轧钢工）工资，实际担任炼钢、轧钢工作的工人因工种职称未确定，被称为养成工而领取低于杂工的工资。此外，住厂工人（机电修理工）不仅不出房租和水电费，而且每月还能领到二百五十公斤煤，住在厂外的工人却什么津贴也没有。旧工资制度的这些不合理现象，严重妨害着工人群众提高技术的积极性，并使一部分工人工作不安心。例如电炉技工刘永顺即因在电炉上的工资不如在机电部门高，而要求调作机电工。有些工人更不满意地说：“技术提高不提高是一样，升上一级也不过是几斤米的事。”
    按八级工资制民主评定工资
            工人安心工作积极提高技术
    因此，该厂经上级批准，即于今年二月开始改革旧工资制度。自二月至四月为准备阶段，在此阶段内调整了劳动组织，具体确定了工种职称。五月至七月按八级工资制评定了工资。在改革工作中，该厂先由厂和车间的党、政、工、团干部并吸收技术人员和工人组成两级评资委员会，学习新工资政策，研究旧工资制度中的问题，统一干部思想。接着在工人中普遍宣传新工资制度的好处和旧工资制度的坏处，同时由厂评资委员会制订出具体的技术标准，交给工人讨论。然后进行民主评资。民主评资的具体作法是先由车间评资委员会根据技术标准，确定出每个工人的技术等级，经过工人讨论，再由厂评资委员会根据工人讨论出的意见修正通过，最后确定其技术等级并确定其工资分。
    实行八级工资制的结果，不但使各级差额加大到二十至三十斤小米，并且使百分之九十二的工人增加了工资，而工资总额却只增加了百分之十五。由于每个工人都确定了适当的工种职称和工资等级，等级差额又比较大，不仅要求改行的工人已不再要求调动而安心于原工作了，而且工人们普遍地提高了研究技术的积极性。“抗美援朝”号电炉工人，过去修镁砖炉墙，炉砖不烘烤便砌筑，时常发生镁砖剥落现象，影响钢的质量。工资改革后，他们积极研究技术，学习了苏联先烤炉砖办法，结果不但炉的寿命提高了近百分之十，钢的质量也提高了百分之九。铸造部的技术研究会，过去经常因为工人无故缺席，会也开不成，现在每星期一次，工人们都积极参加。七月份重点研究降低废品后，该部废品率已由百分之八点三降为百分之一点五。轧钢、炼钢中的一级产品，也因工人们积极改进技术，已较工资改革前增加了百分之九点二。
        工资改革顺利完成关键之一
            是从思想上深入发动了群众
    该厂工资改革工作胜利完成的关键，首先是调整了劳动组织，确定了工种职称，其次是针对工人群众的思想情况，及时解决其问题，深入发动了群众。由于评资前具体确定了工种职称，评资中任意要求过高工资等级的现象就没有了。当该厂把制订的本厂技术标准交由工人讨论时，由于工人们文化水平的限制，有些工作会作而不懂其科学道理，所以很多工人对技术标准中规定的“应知”一项便不满意地说：“评不评吧！文化低算吃不开了！”机电修理工工资按新工资产业顺序要改为低于炼钢和轧钢工的工资，有的机电修理工也就不满意地说：
    “昨天我们比他们高，今天就不如他们了！这里吃不开，搬搬家一样干。”厂评资委员会根据工人群众的这些思想反应，即及时决定“应会全会”、“应知仅知多半”者不降级，并通过全厂宣传员向工人群众说明炼钢和轧钢工的责任比较大，新工资产业顺序是合理的，这样终于解除了思想障碍，使工资改革工作顺利进行下去。
    此外，在评资工作中，该厂中共支部、工会和青年团发动党、团、会员订立了评资公约，保证评时按技术标准，不互相抬高，这也是工资改革工作顺利完成的一个原因。（新华社）
