    Commemorating the Victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Opposing the United States' Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
    Various Democratic Parties Launch Propaganda Activities
   [Reported by this newspaper] Various democratic parties are carrying out various propaganda activities to commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and oppose the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan.

    Central Committee Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang Holds Symposium
    Resolutely Oppose the Separate Peace Treaty with Japan by the US and Britain
    The Central Committee Group of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held an enlarged symposium on the 29th of last month to discuss the issue of opposing the separate peace treaty with Japan by the US and Britain. More than 50 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, members of the Solidarity Committee, and cadres above the level of group leaders of the general and branch departments. The symposium was personally presided over by Li Jishen, chairman of the association. He said: "The US-made treaty is a treaty preparing for war. Foreign Minister Zhou has already issued a solemn statement, representing the opinions of the entire Chinese people. The Chinese people suffered the most and sacrificed the most during the eight-year war of resistance. Now, the US imperialists are trying to arm our enemies with whom we have a bloody feud, and the Chinese people are filled with indignation. This shameless act of the US imperialists of abandoning faith, tearing up international agreements, and excluding New China is opposed by people all over the world. India and Burma have successively declared their refusal to participate in the so-called San Francisco Conference, which has dealt a great blow to the US imperialists. Although the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries will participate, they will go to uphold justice and put forward reasonable proposals. Their purpose of opposing the treaty outside the conference is completely consistent with ours. At present, we should conduct more research on countermeasures." Then, Gan Cisen, Acting Minister of the Propaganda Department of the association, reported on the significance of celebrating the "September 3rd" Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the tasks of strengthening the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and opposing the separate peace treaty with Japan by the US and Britain. Attendees spoke enthusiastically, unanimously pointing out that the peace and democracy camp is growing stronger and will surely shatter this barbaric and unreasonable action of the US imperialists. At the meeting, Xu Baoju reported on the progress of the donation movement for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Participants successively expressed their opinions on strengthening the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Finally, Chairman Li Jishen made a summary, pointing out that the three major movements should be continued, education and propaganda should be strengthened, and the unity of the Asian people should be striven for to oppose the separate peace treaty with Japan by the US imperialists.

    The China Democratic League Notifies Local Organizations to Launch Propaganda
    The Propaganda Committee of the Headquarters of the China Democratic League issued a notice on August 29th to launch propaganda activities to commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and oppose the separate peace treaty with Japan by the US and Britain. The notice first stated: "The day of the victory of the Chinese people's resistance against Japanese imperialism—September 3rd—is approaching, and the San Francisco Peace Conference on Japan, which excludes the People's Republic of China, is scheduled to be forcibly convened by the US imperialists on September 4th. We call on the entire league to launch universal commemorative and propaganda activities in early September in coordination with the people of the whole country, focusing on this glorious festival and serious event." It also instructed local organizations that when holding the victory commemoration meeting of the War of Resistance Against Japan on September 3rd, the speakers should emphasize the following points: (1) The victory of the War of Resistance was won because the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people in long-term arduous struggle, defeated the main force of the Japanese army, and the Soviet Red Army defeated the most elite Kwantung Army of Japan in the Northeast. It also pointed out the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's army in passively resisting Japan and hating patriotic people; (2) The US imperialists' war against Japan was to seize hegemony in the Far East and Asia. Its current plot to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan, arm Japan, invade Korea, and sabotage the Kaesong armistice negotiations is completely following in the footsteps of Japanese imperialism to achieve its goal of aggression against China and Asia; (3) Continue to popularize and deepen the patriotic movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, raise vigilance, strengthen hatred of the enemy, and implement the three calls of the General Association for Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea; (4) The guaranteeing role of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in maintaining peace in Asia and preventing aggression. The notice also called on league members to learn from past experiences in the three major movements and to study in advance Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on August 15th and the People's Daily editorial on August 16th in order to better carry out propaganda.

    The China National Democratic Construction Association Proposes Propaganda Points to Various Branches
            And Convened a Symposium of Committee Members in Beijing
    The China National Democratic Construction Association issued a circular on August 28th, as the "September 3rd Victory Day of the War of Resistance" was approaching, calling on all members of the association to oppose the US-British peace treaty with Japan and expand the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. It also suggested the following key points for propaganda: Opposing the US-British peace treaty with Japan and promoting the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea should be used as regular political education work to deeply publicize China's important contributions to defeating the Japanese invaders, and arouse hatred among members and the masses against the US-British collusion with Japan and arming Japan. The propaganda should focus on Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and the content of the General Association for Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea's notice on commemorating Victory Day, and systematically carry out propaganda work. It should also hold lectures, symposiums, and recall and accusation meetings for members and the masses to promote unified national protest actions, prepare for large-scale demonstrations and parades on National Day, and actively launch a donation payment movement in the industrial and commercial circles.

    The association convened a symposium of general branch committee members in Beijing on August 25th to oppose the US-British peace treaty with Japan. At the symposium, members of the industrial and commercial circles spoke very enthusiastically. Everyone expressed indignation at the US and British imperialists' brutal tearing up of all international agreements, openly excluding the People's Republic of China from the Allied countries, and obliterating our country's hard-fought contributions and due rights. Many people, in their speeches, combined them with the facts of the United States' long-term aggression against China, explaining that they had a clearer ideological understanding of the true face of American aggressors and thoroughly eliminated some of the past wrong views and ideas about the United States. Everyone firmly expressed their support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and vowed to actively launch a donation payment movement to use practical strength to strike against the US-British aggressors.

    The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Calls on All Levels to Conduct In-depth Propaganda
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued a circular to the party's organizations at all levels, calling for the opposition to the US-forced convening of the peace conference with Japan in San Francisco as the central content of commemorative and propaganda activities when commemorating the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance. It also coordinated with the local branches of the Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to carry out universal propaganda activities in an organized and planned manner. The circular also listed the key points of propaganda related to commemorative activities, instructing the party's organizations at all levels to effectively grasp the development of propaganda work, summarize experience at any time, and gradually improve the work so that this propaganda movement can be more universally and deeply spread among the people. The China Association for Promoting Democracy Notifies the Study of the Instructions of the General Association for Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea
    The Beijing Branch of the Association Held a Current Affairs Symposium
    In order to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan on September 3rd, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, in addition to notifying its branches to combine opposition to US imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan and cooperate with local relevant authorities to carry out propaganda and education work, on August 20th, it again notified organizations at all levels to deeply study the "Notice on Commemoration Methods for the Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan on September 3rd" and "Key Points of Propaganda for the Victory Commemoration Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan on September 3rd This Year" of the Chinese People's Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and use them as an important guideline for propaganda and education work at this stage. The notice instructed that after September 3rd, special contact should be made with primary and secondary school teachers to hold various small gatherings and encourage them to widely carry out propaganda among the masses. At the same time, it instructed local organizations to focus on arousing the masses' love for the motherland and hatred for US imperialism in their propaganda, earnestly check the implementation of patriotic covenants, strengthen the patriotic movement of increasing production and donating weapons, and mobilize participants in donations to pay quickly.

    The Beijing Branch of the association held a current affairs symposium on August 25th to exchange views on the Korean armistice negotiations, the US unilateral peace treaty with Japan, and the handling of US secret agent espionage cases by the military law office of the Beijing Military Control Commission. More than 80 people attended, including members of the association and some primary and secondary school teachers who were invited to participate. At the meeting, everyone spoke enthusiastically, unanimously believing that the facts that US imperialism obstructed and sabotaged the Korean armistice negotiations, unilaterally concluded a peace treaty with Japan, and sent spies and secret agents to carry out various sabotage activities in our country more clearly exposed the ferocious face of US imperialism and further proved that US imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. The Chinese people must be more vigilant, step up opposition to the separate US-British peace treaty with Japan, and the propaganda of the United States arming Japan, strengthen the patriotic movement of increasing production and donating, and give US imperialism a greater blow.

    纪念抗日战争胜利、反对美国单独对日媾和
    各民主党派纷纷展开宣传活动
   【本报讯】各民主党派为纪念抗日战争胜利、反对美国单独对日媾和，展开各种宣传活动。
    民革中央小组举行座谈会
    坚决反对美英单独对日媾和
    中国国民党革命委员会中央小组于上月二十九日举行扩大座谈会，讨论反对美英单独对日媾和问题，到中央委员、团结委员和总分部组长以上干部共五十余人。座谈由该会主席李济深亲自主持，他说：“美制和约是准备战争的条约，周外长前已发表严正的声明，代表了全中国人民的意见。中国人民在八年抗战中所受痛苦最深，牺牲最大。现在美帝国主义竟要武装我们血海深仇的敌人，中国人民无不愤怒填膺。美帝国主义这种背弃信义，撕毁国际协定，排斥新中国的无耻行为，世界人民群起反对。印度、缅甸先后声明拒绝参加所谓旧金山和会，给美帝国主义打击很大，苏联、波兰、捷克等国虽将参加，但是去主持正义，另外提出合理的建议，他们和我们会外反对的目的完全一致，目前我们应就对策方面多加研究。”接着由该会宣传部代部长甘祠森报告庆祝“九三”抗日胜利纪念日的意义，加强抗美援朝工作和反对美英单独对日媾和的工作任务后，到会者热烈发言，一致指出和平民主阵营日益强大，必可粉碎美帝国主义这种蛮横无理的行动。会上，许宝驹报告了抗美援朝捐献运动的进展。与会者相继对加强抗美援朝工作发表了意见。最后由李济深主席作总结，指出应继续开展三大运动，加强教育宣传，争取亚洲人民团结，来反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和。
    民盟通知各地组织展开宣传
    中国民主同盟总部宣传委员会为纪念抗日战争胜利、反对美英单独对日媾和，于八月二十九日发出展开宣传活动的通知。首称：“中国人民反抗日本帝国主义的胜利纪念日——九月三日即将到来，而美帝国主义将中华人民共和国排斥在外的旧金山对日和会，竟定于九月四日强制召开。我们号召全盟针对此光荣节日与严重事件，在九月初旬配合全国人民展开普遍性的纪念、宣传活动”。并指示各地组织在九月三日举行抗日战争胜利纪念会时，报告人应强调如下几点：（1）抗日战争之所以赢得胜利，是由于中国共产党领导中国人民长期艰苦奋斗，击败日本的陆军主力，和苏联红军在东北击溃日本最精锐的关东军所致，并指出蒋介石军队消极抗日仇视爱国人民的罪恶；（2）美帝国主义的对日战争是争夺远东和亚洲的霸权。它今天的片面对日媾和、武装日本、侵略朝鲜、破坏开城停战谈判等阴谋诡计，完全是步日本帝国主义的后尘，以达其侵略中国和亚洲的目的；（3）继续普及深入抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义运动，提高警惕，加强敌忾，贯彻抗美援朝总会的三项号召；（4）中苏友好同盟互助条约对于维护亚洲和平防止侵略的保障作用。通知又号召该盟盟员吸取以往在三大运动中的经验并事先学习周恩来外长八月十五日的声明及八月十六日人民日报的社论，以便更好地进行宣传。
    民建向各分会提出宣传要点
            并召集在京委员举行座谈会
    民主建国会因“九三抗战胜利纪念日”即将到来，于八月二十八日发出通告，号召该会全体会员反对美英对日和约，扩大抗美援朝运动。并提示宣传要点如下：反对美英对日和约，推进抗美援朝运动，应作为经常的政治教育工作，深入宣传我国战胜日寇的重要贡献，激起会员和群众，反对美英对日媾和、武装日本的仇恨。宣传要以周外长声明、抗美援朝总会纪念胜利日通知内容为要点，有系统地展开宣传工作。并召开会员与群众的讲演会、座谈会、回忆控诉会等，推进全国一致的抗议行动，准备国庆日的大示威游行，积极发动工商界的捐献缴款运动。
    该会曾于八月二十五日召集在北京的总分会委员举行反对美英对日和会的座谈会。在座谈会中，工商界会员发言非常踊跃。大家对美、英帝国主义横暴地撕毁一切国际协议，公然把中华人民共和国排除于盟国之外，抹杀我国坚苦抗战的功绩与应有的权利，表示愤慨；不少人在发言时，结合过去美国长期侵略中国的事实，说明自己从思想上更清楚地认识了美国侵略者的真正面目，并澈底肃清了过去对于美国的一些错误的看法和想法。大家坚决表示拥护周外长的声明，并要积极发动捐献缴款运动，用实际力量来打击美英侵略者。
    农工民主党号召各级深入宣传
    中国农工民主党中央委员会对该党各级组织发出通告，号召在纪念抗战胜利六周年时，将反对美国强制各国在旧金山举行的对日和会，作为纪念、宣传活动的中心内容。并配合各该地抗美援朝分会，有组织有计划地展开普遍性的宣传活动。该通告同时列举了有关纪念活动的宣传要点，指示该党各级组织应切实掌握宣传工作的发展，随时总结经验，将工作逐渐提高，使得这一宣传运动能更普遍深入到人民群众中。民进通知研讨抗美援朝总会指示
    该会北京市分会举行时事座谈会
    中国民主促进会为纪念九月三日抗日战争胜利六周年纪念日，除已电告该会各分会结合反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和，配合当地有关机关展开宣传教育工作外，于八月二十日再度通知各级组织深入研讨中国人民抗美援朝总会“关于九月三日抗日战争胜利日纪念办法的通知”及“今年九月三日抗日战争胜利纪念日的宣传要点”，并以此作为这一阶段宣传教育工作的重要方针。通知指示，九月三日以后，应特别联系中小学教师，举行各种的小型集会，并鼓动他们广泛地向群众展开宣传。同时，指示各地组织在宣传中应着重激发群众对祖国的热爱和对美帝国主义的仇恨，切实检查爱国公约执行情况，加强爱国增产捐献武器运动，发动参加捐献者赶快缴款。
    该会北京市分会于八月二十五日举行时事座谈会，就朝鲜停战谈判问题，美国片面对日媾和问题以及北京市军事管制委员会军法处处理美国特务间谍案件交换意见。到会的共八十余人，除该会会员外并有一部分中小学教师被邀参加。会上，大家热烈发言，一致认为美帝国主义阻挠破坏朝鲜停战谈判，片面对日媾和，并派遣间谍特务在我国进行各种破坏的事实，更清楚地暴露了美帝国主义穷凶极恶的面貌，更进一步证明美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。中国人民一定更加警惕，加紧反对美英单独对日媾和，美国武装日本的宣传，加强爱国增产捐献运动，给美帝国主义以更大打击。
