The movement of patriotic Catholic and Christian believers in various regions to accuse imperialist elements of their crimes and demand that they be severely punished or deported has made great progress. Since May, Catholic and Christian believers in more than forty large and medium-sized cities across the country have held meetings to accuse imperialist elements within the Chinese Church of their crimes.

According to incomplete statistics from May, June, July, and August, a total of 113 imperialist elements have been exposed by Catholics and Christians in various regions during the accusation movement. Most of them are of American and French nationality, followed by Spanish, Italian, Belgian, Dutch, and German. The majority of them are Catholic. Thirty-three of them have been deported with the approval of the People's Government at the request of believers and people from all walks of life. A portion of the others have been placed under surveillance, arrested, ordered to apologize and repent, or sentenced to imprisonment according to law.

These imperialist elements, wearing a bodhisattva face, claim to be "single-mindedly devoted to missionary work and saving souls," to be "apolitical," and to have "no connection with imperialism." However, the irrefutable facts revealed in various regions prove that these imperialist elements in religious garb are thorough counter-revolutionaries and ferocious pawns of imperialism in its aggression against China. According to statistics from June to the present, as many as 33 imperialist spies have been arrested or discovered by the government through mass exposure in Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Shenyang, Qingdao, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Kunming, Yulin in Guangxi, Anqing in northern Anhui, Tongling and Dongliu in southern Anhui. They hid weapons and radio stations, collected intelligence, published reactionary books and periodicals, slandered the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, undermined Sino-Soviet friendship, and even organized reactionary groups such as the "Legion of Mary" and the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" to attack patriotic believers and sabotage the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.

They established so-called "Charity Halls" and "Orphanages" and other "charitable" and "relief" institutions, which in fact were dens of murder. According to figures revealed in various regions, more than 100,000 children have been victimized nationwide (some are only recent figures, and in some places the imperialist elements have destroyed the materials out of fear of crime, making it impossible to verify). The mortality rate of children fostered in "Charity Halls" and "Orphanages" is generally above 60% or 70%, and in some cases even reaches above 95%. Recently, the "San Shan Tang" exposed by the people of Dazhou County in northern Sichuan had taken in a total of 3,704 infants in the past 28 years, but now only 33 remain. Seventy-two people escaped over the years because they could not bear the abuse, and the remaining 3,599 have died; the mortality rate is 97%. The thirty-three surviving children in the hall also suffer from serious illnesses or are disabled. The imperialist elements of the "San Shan Tang" often drew blood from children in the name of blood tests and sold it to patients in hospitals. An infant only three months old died immediately after having 12 CC of blood drawn. The orphan Li Ruzhuan was also killed by having 200 CC of blood drawn. They even inhumanly killed living children to make human specimens. The imperialist elements of the hall also harmed patients in the hospital in the same way. Resident Liu Jinghua accused that her husband suffered from abdominal disease. A French Taoist priest of the hall, Jin Shanle, said that surgery was needed, but after opening his stomach, he immediately forced her to pay the handling fee, otherwise he would not sew up the incision. As a result, the patient rolled around in pain, and his intestines flowed out and died.

In rural areas, the exploitation of peasants by these imperialist elements was even more vicious and savage. Tao Demu, a Belgian missionary arrested by the People's Government of Sa County in Suiyuan Province at the request of Catholic believers and the people, had been riding on the heads of local peasant Catholics for more than 20 years, wielding power and influence, controlling the "People's Corps" armed forces, setting up private courts, and holding the power of life and death. He once buried the peasant He Yuanzhu alive under trumped-up charges and demolished the house of the believer Wang Fuxiang. The imperialist elements of the Catholic "San Shan Tang" in Dazhou County, northern Sichuan, forced farmers to rent the land they had seized at a ratio of two to eight (the hall took eight shares, and the tenant farmers only two shares). If the farmers could not pay the rent in full that year, they would be subjected to heavy usury. For example, the peasant Guo Renmao of Baijie Township owed seven dou of rent in 1946, which rolled to seven shi with interest on interest in the third year.

Through the accusation of the crimes of the imperialist elements, the Catholic and Christian believers have further realized the nature of imperialism using religion for aggression, their consciousness has been greatly improved, and they have actively participated in the innovation movement. As of August 27, the number of Christians who signed in support of the innovation movement nationwide reached 277,816. In July and August, the Catholic Church in Wuxi, Yangzhou, Hefei, Dongliu, Dangtu, Yuanling, Jiujiang, Chongqing and other places, and the Christian Church in Xiamen, Nanjing and other places established leading institutions for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, convened representative meetings or issued declarations of the Three-Self renovation. The Fujian Diocese of the Chinese Anglican Church also held a new life evening party, expressing its determination to sever all ties with imperialism and celebrating the liberation of the diocese from the influence of imperialist aggression. In particular, Nanjing, where the accusation movement has been relatively successful, has recently launched a democratic reform movement in most churches. Many believers are earnestly participating in the work of transforming the church with the attitude of masters. Some church leaders can also initially draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and together with the vast number of believers, form a team to thoroughly eliminate imperialist forces and counter-revolutionary elements within the church. This has laid a good foundation for further carrying out the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.

    各地爱国宗教徒反帝国主义的斗争
    杨农安
    各地天主教、基督教爱国教徒控诉帝国主义分子罪行，并要求将他们严厉惩办或驱逐出境的运动，已有很大进展。自五月份以来，全国已有四十个以上大中城市的天主教及基督教的教徒举行了控诉中国教会内帝国主义分子罪恶的集会。
    据五、六、七、八共四个月的不完全材料统计，各地天主教、基督教徒在控诉运动中检举出来的帝国主义分子已达一百一十三名，国籍大部分属美、法二国，其次是西班牙、意大利、比利时、荷兰、德国等；教别大多数是天主教。经人民政府接受教徒及各界人民要求将其驱逐出境的达三十三名，另有一部分则已依法加以管制，逮捕，或令其道歉悔过，或判处徒刑。
    这些装着一副菩萨面孔的帝国主义分子，自己说是“一心致力于传教救灵工作”，是“超政治”的，“和帝国主义没联系”。但是，各地揭发的确凿的事实，都证明这些披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子是十足的反革命分子，是帝国主义侵略中国的凶恶爪牙。仅据六月份到目前的统计，在北京、天津、西安、沈阳、青岛、扬州、南京、昆明、广西的郁林，皖北的安庆，皖南的铜陵、东流等地经群众检举被政府逮捕或发现的帝国主义间谍分子已达三十三名之多，他们匿藏武器、电台，搜集情报，出版反动书刊，诬蔑中国共产党和人民政府，破坏中苏友谊，更组织“圣母军”，“公教青年报国团”等反动团体，打击爱国教徒，破坏三自革新运动。
    他们设立了所谓“仁慈堂”、“育婴院”等“慈善”、“救济”机构，事实上这都是一些杀人的魔窟。据各地已揭露的数字，全国被害儿童达十万以上（有些仅是近年来的数字，有些地方因帝国主义分子畏罪已将材料焚毁，无从查考了）。寄养在“仁慈堂”、“育婴院”的儿童，死亡率一般都在百分之六十或七十以上，有的甚至达到百分之九十五以上。最近川北达县人民所揭发的“三善堂”，二十八年来共收容婴儿三千七百零四人，但现在只剩下三十三人，历年因不堪虐待而逃出的有七十二人，其余三千五百九十九人都已死亡；死亡率达百分之九十七。该堂幸存的三十三个儿童，也绝大多数患有严重的病症，或已成残废。“三善堂”的帝国主义分子经常以验血为名，抽出儿童的鲜血卖给病院病人。有一个出生才三个月的婴儿，被抽出十二CC血液后立即死亡。孤儿李汝瑑也被抽血二百CC致死。他们更毫无人性地将活生生的儿童杀死，制作人体标本。该堂帝国主义分子对医院内的病人也同样加以残害。居民刘景华控诉说，她丈夫患腹病，该堂法籍修道金善乐说需要开刀，但剖开肚子后，却立逼着要她把手续费缴齐，否则不缝刀口；结果病人痛得乱翻乱滚，肚肠流出而死。
    在农村，这些帝国主义分子对农民的压榨更是刻毒野蛮。绥远省萨县人民政府接受天主教徒及人民群众的要求而逮捕的比利时籍传教士陶德模，二十几年来一直骑在当地农民天主教徒头上作威作福，控制“民团”武装，私设公堂，掌握生杀予夺之权。他曾以莫须有的罪名，活埋了农民贺元柱，拆毁了教徒王福祥的房子。川北达县天主教“三善堂”的帝国主义分子，曾将他所霸占的土地以二八比例（该堂取八分，佃户仅二分）强迫农民租种。农民如当年不能缴齐租谷，即受到重利盘剥。如百节乡农民郭仁茂，一九四六年欠租七斗，第三年就利上加利滚到了七石。
    天主教、基督教教徒们通过对帝国主义分子罪行的控诉，更进一步地认识了帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的本质，觉悟大大提高，积极参加了革新运动。截至八月二十七日为止，全国基督教徒拥护革新运动签名人数已达二十七万七千八百一十六人。七、八两月，无锡、扬州、合肥、东流、当涂、沅陵、九江、重庆等地的天主教及厦门、南京等地的基督教均成立了三自革新运动的领导机构、召开了代表会或发表了三自革新宣言。中华圣公会福建教区还举行了新生晚会，表示坚决与帝国主义割断一切联系，并欢庆该教区从帝国主义侵略影响下解放出来。特别是控诉运动开展得比较有成绩的南京，最近大部分教堂已展开了民主改革运动，许多教徒以主人翁的姿态认真地参加了改造教会的工作，部分教会领袖，也能初步划清敌我界限，与广大教徒一起，组成了一支为澈底肃清教会内部帝国主义势力与反革命分子而斗争的队伍，这给进一步开展三自革新运动奠定了良好的基础。
