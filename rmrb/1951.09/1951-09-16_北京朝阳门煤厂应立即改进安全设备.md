    The Chaoyangmen Coal Yard in Beijing Should Immediately Improve Safety Equipment
    The person in charge of the Chaoyangmen Coal Yard, a branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company in Beijing, does not pay attention to worker safety. The company stores a lot of coal in the summer, and the coal piles are very high. When workers unload the trucks, they have to use coal baskets to carry the coal. Because the coal piles are high and the train cars are low, the workers find it very difficult and dangerous. Workers at the loading and unloading branch suggested to the factory that they should level the piles before unloading to avoid accidents, but the person in charge of the company said, "We paid you to carry the coal, so you have to carry it." This shows that they do not pay attention to worker safety.
    On the afternoon of June 22nd, while unloading coal, the slope of the springboard leading from the coal pile to the freight car was too steep. Coal pieces rolled out of the baskets, and worker Sun Huitang was hit by the coal and fell off the springboard, injuring his internal organs. After several days of treatment, he did not improve and could not work. Workers Shi Zhefeng, Peng Ying, Ma Degui, Hou Zhenhu and others were also injured after falling from the springboard in similar situations. In addition, the lighting equipment in the factory is poor, but instead of installing more lights, the factory often turns off the main power switch, stopping the power supply while the workers are working.
    On the night of August 23rd, about half an hour after the workers started unloading the truck, the lights suddenly went out. At that time, Zhang, the stationmaster from Chaoyangmen, contacted the factory, and the factory said the lights were broken. Later, the workers personally went to check and found out that the main power switch was turned off.
    We suggest that the responsible comrades of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company go to the site to understand why the person in charge of the factory does not pay attention to worker safety, and the comrade who said "If you pay, you have to unload the truck" should be criticized.

### 北京朝阳门煤厂应立即改进安全设备

    北京朝阳门煤厂应立即改进安全设备
    中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司朝阳门煤厂的负责人不重视工人安全。该公司夏季储煤很多，煤堆很高，工友卸车时须用煤筐抬卸，因煤堆高车皮低工人非常吃力而且危险。装卸分社工友曾向该厂提出建议，要他们平堆后再卸，以免发生意外，但该公司经办人却说“我们花了抬卸钱，你们就得给抬。”这说明了他们对工人安全很不注意。
    六月二十二日下午卸煤时，从煤堆通向货车间的跳板坡度太大，煤块从筐里滚下来，工友孙惠棠被煤块砸下跳板，震伤身体内部，经医治数日未见好转，不能工作。工友石者凤、彭英、马德贵、侯振湖等也曾因同样情形，先后由跳板掉下受伤。又该厂灯光设备不好，可是厂方不但不增设电灯，反而经常在工友工作时，关闭总电门，停止电源。
    八月二十三日夜间工友刚卸车约半小时之际，灯光忽灭，当时由朝阳门张站长向该厂联系，该厂说灯坏了，后经工友亲自跑去检查，才知道是总电门关上了。
    我们建议煤业建筑器材公司的负责同志深入现场了解该厂负责人员为何不重视工人安全，对于那个说“给钱就得给卸车”的同志，更应给予批评。
