    People's proposals submitted to the People's Congress reflect the various political, economic, and cultural demands and urgent problems of the people of all strata, and their opinions on national work. With the development of the people's democratic life and the improvement of the people's awareness, the masses attach great importance to how their various opinions and demands are realized, and regard it as one of the signs of testing whether the People's Congress is "democratic." Therefore, attaching importance to these demands and reflections, and seriously handling the people's proposals, has become one of the keys to making the representative meeting a regular system, and is an important method for the People's Government to maintain close ties with the masses.
    Most county People's Congresses in North China generally attach importance to the people's proposals. They solicit proposals before the meeting, concentrate the demands of the masses, review and handle them at the meeting, and are responsible for solving some problems that must be solved. Those that cannot be solved are also clearly explained. This has established the idea of representatives being "masters of their own affairs," inspired the enthusiasm of representatives from all walks of life, and thus made the People's Congress system increasingly consolidated and promoted the development of various tasks. For example, in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, people from all walks of life unanimously demanded road construction. This issue was enthusiastically discussed at the representative meeting, and a specific decision was made to build roads throughout the county. After the meeting, more than 100,000 people participated in the road construction campaign, making it possible for villages in the mountainous areas, which were previously inaccessible to trucks, to be accessible to trucks, thereby facilitating the people and promoting the exchange of materials. The people reflected: "Problems that could not be solved for thousands of years have been solved at the representative meeting." At the first People's Congress of Anguo County, Hebei Province, a river management plan was formulated based on the masses' demands for river management, and inspections were conducted regularly, which greatly reduced river management disputes in the county, and corrected the localism of individual villages, promoting the smooth development of river management work. In the four counties of Pingyao, Yuci, Yushe, and Shouyang in Shanxi, 3,383 proposals were handled in one year, which was supported by the broad masses. The people reflected: "The representatives' words are effective." The prestige of the People's Congress has also been improved accordingly. The Yangqu County Government in the province holds monthly meetings of relevant departments to implement the proposals, check the progress of handling them, and invite members of the Standing Committee to attend. After the fifth meeting, the county's leadership further clarified the idea that "seriously handling proposals is one of the keys to holding a good representative meeting," and formulated the "Yangqu County Measures for Handling Proposals of People's Representatives from All Walks of Life," making the handling of people's proposals systematic. As a result of doing so, the sixth meeting received a total of 1,394 proposals, of which 751 have been resolved, 532 have been handled, and explanations have been given for the 111 that cannot be handled. This effectively educated the cadres, helped the government overcome bureaucracy, improved work, and strengthened the ties between the people and the government. From then on, it greatly promoted the work of the People's Congress and various construction tasks. The representatives felt that the meeting solved problems, and they reflected: "We can report back to the masses," "What we say is effective, this is really being the master of our own affairs." The phenomenon of representatives absenting themselves from meetings without reason has been greatly reduced. For example, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, did not pay attention to proposals at the fourth meeting, and 90 people were absent from the fifth meeting; after the county paid attention to correcting this shortcoming, the number of absent representatives at the seventh meeting was very small.
    At present, many counties have not paid attention to the importance of this issue, and often adopt an indifferent attitude towards people's proposals. First of all, the meeting notices are sent out very late, the agenda of the meeting is not notified, and the representatives are not seriously organized to collect the opinions and demands of the people. The representatives are temporarily called to attend the meeting in a hurry; or like "work reports," a proposal collection outline is formulated, and the collection of people's opinions is limited to: "Can your village have one chicken per person? Can you have one sheep per person?" This makes it impossible for the representatives to correctly and completely reflect the people's opinions, and there are very few proposals. For example, at the fourth People's Congress of Ying County, there were only eight proposals due to the late notice. Secondly, the proposals are not seriously discussed and handled during the meeting, and the government hastily answers them; some are not discussed at all, and the county magistrate uses methods such as "explanation," "answering," "asking for instructions from higher authorities," and "handing over to relevant departments for processing" to give a vague and perfunctory reply. Some counties have even stopped organizing the "Proposal Review Committee" after holding several meetings, and have actually cancelled the item of "solving proposals." Due to the lack of serious discussion in the meeting, the phenomenon of putting the proposals aside after the meeting and not handling them has occurred. For example, the resolutions of the People's Congress of Xinxian County, Shanxi Province, are routinely handed over to various departments for handling, and no inspection is carried out; not long after the meeting, most of the cadres of the relevant departments have forgotten how many resolutions there are, let alone handling them. At the representative meeting of Mancheng County, Hebei Province, a representative proposed to build water conservancy on Baoyang Mountain. The government replied that it would ask the higher authorities for instructions, but it did not ask for instructions or solve the problem for a long time. Some counties have suppressed the people's proposals for a year. For example, nine proposals from the spring 1950 meeting in Huolu County have not yet been handled. Many county People's Congresses have not yet established a system for reporting the results of proposal handling to the meeting, so some proposals have not been resolved even after being raised five or six times. As a result, the masses lack confidence in the possibility of solving their problems at the representative meeting, and the representatives reflect: "The problem is not solved," "There is no way to report back to the masses," "It's useless to propose, I won't propose anymore." Therefore, the number of proposals is decreasing day by day. For example, the number of proposals at the representative meetings in various counties in Hebei Province this spring has dropped from about 500 each time last year to generally less than 100 this year. On the one hand, due to the establishment of village representative meetings and the improvement of government work, the number of specific problems submitted by the masses to the representative meeting has naturally decreased, but the main reason is the result of not seriously handling them. There were 381 proposals at the third meeting of Huailai County, Chahar Province, 100 or so at the fourth meeting, dozens at the fifth meeting, and only a few five or six at the sixth meeting; Yuncheng County, Pingyuan Province, with a population of 630,000, had only five proposals. Some individual counties even treat the handling of proposals as "optional," collecting them if they want to, and not collecting them if they don't want to; this suffocates the demands of the people and affects the solution of practical problems among the masses. For example, there were 1,829 proposals at the first meeting of Linyu County, Hebei Province, but there were none at the second and third meetings. Due to the lack of serious handling of proposals, the people lack confidence in solving their problems at the representative meeting, which affects the enthusiasm of representatives to attend the meeting, so that the meeting system cannot be consolidated. The root cause of the above problems is that some leaders do not fully understand that the People's Congress is the organ of power for the broad masses of people to manage their own affairs and state affairs. They are accustomed to a few people monopolizing everything, issuing orders, and not accustomed to listening to the opinions of the people, thus obliterating the people's democratic right to fully discuss issues at the representative meeting. Secondly, some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the "consistency between being responsible to higher authorities and being responsible to the masses." They do not link the immediate interests of the masses with the country's political and economic construction tasks, thereby inspiring the masses to take active action and do a good job in various national construction tasks; instead, they simply regard the representative meeting as "an auxiliary method for implementing central work," forming the situation that "meetings are held for the purpose of simply arranging tasks, and representatives come to accept tasks," cutting off the connection between representatives and the people. Under these circumstances, the representative meeting itself will not be consolidated, and the implementation of central work will also be affected.
    In short, seriously handling proposals, attaching importance to the people's demands and the solution of immediate problems, is one of the fundamental issues in the relationship between the People's Government and the masses, and therefore is one of the keys to holding a good People's Congress. Wherever the handling of people's proposals is valued, the connection between the People's Government and the people will be strengthened, the representative meeting will be increasingly consolidated, and the work style of cadres can be improved and the work can be promoted according to the demands of the masses. Conversely, it will produce increasingly worse consequences.
    The proposals themselves are also more complicated, including the common demands of the people of the whole county, as well as specific problems to a village, an event, and an individual; there are matters of inquiry due to unclear policies, as well as suggestions to the government and criticisms of the government's work and cadres; some can be handled immediately, some must be handled slowly, and some cannot be handled by themselves and need to be reported to higher authorities for handling. At the same time, in the early stage of the representative meeting, there are often more individual specific problems. With the development of the work of the representative meeting and the deepening of democratization, proposals reflecting the common demands of the masses are also gradually increasing. Therefore, handling proposals in the short days of the meeting is a delicate task.
    Based on the experience of various places in handling proposals, we must pay attention to the following points:
   (1) We must attach importance to the handling of proposals. We should not only pay attention to the solution of the masses' immediate problems in the proposals, but also grasp the universal demands among the people through the handling of proposals, concentrate them and solve them, so as to improve the work of solving proposals. To this end, the People's Government must regularly study the demands of the masses and strengthen the analysis and research of proposals.
   (2) The collection of proposals should be combined with the selection of representatives and the publicity of the central content of the meeting, and the masses can be mobilized to study solutions. This can not only reflect the demands of the masses, but also improve the awareness of the masses.
    (3) Before the meeting, the Standing Committee should conduct research in conjunction with relevant departments and put forward preliminary opinions; during the meeting, they should consult with representatives from all walks of life to handle them, and submit general policy-related issues to the conference for discussion and resolution. General inquiries should be answered by the presidium of the conference after research, and suggestions should be handed over to relevant departments for handling or reference. Explanations should be given for those that cannot be handled or should be handled slowly. Criticisms of the government's work and cadres should be seriously reviewed and handled by relevant agencies and cadres; investigations should also be explained. Finally, they should be printed into a booklet and distributed to the representatives.
   (4) After the meeting, earnestly organize forces to implement them, conduct regular inspections, form a system, and report the results of handling to the next meeting. Departments and cadres who do not earnestly implement the resolutions of the meeting should be criticized and punished.
   (5) Strengthen the regular contact between the Standing Committee and the representatives, collect the opinions of the masses at any time, and reflect them to the government for resolution; at the same time, urge the government to resolve the proposals.
   (6) In order to enable the representative meeting to focus on solving the common demands of the people, we should regularly educate the people and representatives on how to propose and collect proposals.

    人民代表会议必须认真处理代表的提案
    侯永
    人民群众提交人民代表会议的提案，反映着各阶层人民在政治上、经济上、文化上的各种要求和需要解决的切身问题，反映着他们对国家工作的各种意见。随着人民民主生活的发展和人民觉悟程度的提高，群众对如何实现他们的各种意见和要求是异常重视的，并把它做为考验人民代表会“是否民主”的标志之一。因而重视人民这些要求和反映，认真地处理人民的提案，也就成为使代表会议形成经常制度的关键之一，是人民政府密切联系群众的重要方法之一。
    华北地区多数县人民代表会议，一般的对于人民的提案是重视的，会前征集提案，集中了群众要求，会上加以审查处理，负责解决了必需解决的一些问题，不能解决的亦作了明确的解释，这样就树立了代表“当家做主人”的思想，启发了各界人民代表的积极性，从而也就使人民代表会议制度日臻巩固，推动了各项工作的开展。如平原省林县，各界人民一致要求修路，在代表会议上热烈地讨论了这个问题，作出了全县修路的具体决定。会后即有十万余群众参加了修路运动，使过去不通大车的山地，做到村村畅通大车，由此便利了人民，促进了物资交流。老百姓反映：“几千年不能解决的问题，在代表会上解决了。”河北省安国县第一次人民代表大会上，根据群众治河要求，制定了治河计划，经常检查，使该县治河纠纷大为减少，个别村的本位思想也由此得到纠正，推动了治河工作的顺利开展。山西平遥、榆次、榆社、寿阳四县，一年来处理提案三、三八三件，获得广大群众拥护，人民反映：“代表说话顶事”。人民代表会议的威信亦随之提高。该省阳曲县政府每月召集有关执行提案的部门开会，检查处理情形，并请常委列席参加。第五次会议后，该县领导思想上更明确了“认真处理提案是开好代表会议的关键之一”，制定了阳曲县关于“各界人民代表会议提案处理办法”，使处理人民的提案制度化起来。由于这样做的结果，六次会议共收到提案一、三九四件，已解决七五一件，已办五三二件，不能办的一一一件也作了解释。这有力地教育了干部，帮助政府克服官僚主义，改进了工作，密切了人民与政府的联系。从此大大推动了人民代表会议工作和各项建设工作，代表们感到开会解决问题，他们反映：“咱们回去好交代”，“咱们说一句顶一句，这真是当家作主人了”。代表无故不出席会议的现象大为减少，如山西翼城县四次会议时对提案不重视，五次会议缺席达九○人；该县注意纠正这个缺点后，七次会议缺席代表为数即很少。
    现在尚有不少的县份没有注意这问题的重要性，对人民提案往往采取着漠不关心的态度，首先是会议通知发得很晚，不通知会议的议程，不认真组织代表搜集人民的意见和要求，临时把代表找来，仓促开会；或和要“工作报告”一样，制定提案搜集提纲、把搜集人民意见限于：“你村能否一人一鸡？能不能一人一只羊？”的圈子里，这样使代表不能正确地完全地反映人民意见，而提案甚少。如应县四次各界人民代表会议由于通知太晚，仅有提案八件。其次是在会议中间对提案不认真讨论处理，仓促的由政府解答一番；有的根本不讨论，只由县长用“解释”“解答”“请示上级”“交有关部门处理”等办法，来一个含糊其词的敷衍答复。甚至有的县在开过几次会议后，连“提案审查委员会”也不组织了，实际上取消了“解决提案”这一项内容。由于会议中不认真讨论，会后把提案搁置一旁，不加处理的现象也就发生了。如山西省忻县各界人民代表会议的决议，只是照例地交各部门办理，亦不检查；会开过不久，决议究有几条？有关部门的大部分干部早忘记了，更谈不上处理。河北省满城县代表会上，曾有一位代表提议修抱阳山水利，政府答复请示上级处理，但长期间既不请示，也不解决。有的县把人民的提案压了一年，如获鹿县一九五○年春天会议的提案，至今仍有九件未获处理。很多县人民代表会议，还没有建立关于向会议报告提案处理结果的制度，因而有些提案连提五、六次仍得不到解决。致使群众对代表会议解决问题的可能性缺乏信心，代表们反映：“不解决问题”，“回去没办法向群众交代”，“提了也不顶事，再不提了”。因此提案日益减少，如河北省各县今春代表会议的提案，由去年每次约五百件，今年降到一般不达百件。这一方面由于村代表会的建立和政府工作的改进，群众具体问题提交代表会者自然减少，但主要是不认真处理的结果。察省怀来县第三次会议时提案有三八一件，第四次百来件，第五次还有几十件，第六次只有寥寥五、六件了；平原省的郓城县，六十三万人口仅有提案五件。甚至个别县把处理提案当成“配搭”，愿要就搜集，不愿要就不搜集；这样就窒息了人民群众的要求，影响了群众中实际问题的解决。如河北临榆县第一次会议时有提案一、八二九件，第二、三两次会议竟一件没有。由于对提案不认真处理，使人民对在代表会解决自己的问题缺乏信心，影响了代表出席会议的积极性，致使会议制度不能巩固起来。发生以上问题的根本原因，首先是有些领导者不完全了解人民代表会议是广大人民管理自己事务和国家事务的权力机关，他们习惯于少数人包办一切，发号施令，不习惯听取人民的意见办事，便抹杀了人民在代表会议上充分讨论问题的民主权利。其次是，有些同志对“对上负责和对群众负责的一致性”认识不足。没有把群众的切身利益和国家的政治、经济建设任务联系起来，从而启发群众积极地行动起来，做好各项国家建设任务；而单纯地把代表会当成“贯彻中心工作的一种辅助方式”，形成“会议为单纯布置任务而开，代表为接受任务而来”，隔断了代表与人民的联系。在这种情况下，代表会本身不会巩固，中心工作的执行也会受到影响。
    总之，认真处理提案、重视人民要求和切身问题的解决，是人民政府和群众关系中的根本问题之一，因此也是能否开好人民代表会议的关键之一。凡是重视了处理人民提案的地方，人民政府与人民群众的联系就加强了，代表会议也就日臻巩固，从而也能根据群众要求改进干部作风，推动工作。反之，则会产生每况愈下的恶果。
    提案本身也是较复杂的，有全县人民的共同要求，也有具体到一村、一事和一人的具体问题；有因对政策不明了而询问的事项，也有向政府的建议和对政府工作与干部的批评，有马上能办的、有必须缓办和本身不能办需请示上级办的。同时，在代表会初期，往往是个别的具体问题多。随着代表会工作的发展，民主化的加深，反映群众共同要求的提案也逐渐增加着。因此在短短的几天会议中间处理提案又是个细腻的工作。
    根据各地在处理提案方面的经验，我们必须注意下列几点：
   （一）必须重视提案的处理。不仅注意提案中的群众切身问题的解决，而且必须通过处理提案，抓住人民中带有普遍性的要求，集中起来加以解决，使解决提案的工作提高一步。为此，人民政府就必须经常研究群众的要求，加强对提案的分析研究工作。
   （二）提案搜集应结合选代表和宣传会议的中心内容来进行，并可发动群众研究解决的办法。这样既可以反映群众要求，同时，又可以提高群众的觉悟。
    （三）会前经常委会结合有关部门进行研究，提出初步意见；会议中间和各界代表协商处理，将一般性的涉及政策的问题提交大会讨论做出决议。一般询问事项由大会主席团研究后加以解答，建议事项交有关部门办理或参考，不能办和缓办的加以解释。对政府工作和干部的批评，有关机关和干部应认真检讨，进行处理；需调查者也要说明。最后印制成册分发各代表。
   （四）会后认真组织力量贯彻执行，定期检查，形成制度，并将处理结果向下次会议报告。不认真执行会议决议的部门和干部，应予以批评和处分。
   （五）加强常委会与代表的经常联系，随时搜集群众意见，向政府反映，加以解决；同时督促政府解决提案。
   （六）为使代表会议集中地解决人民的普遍要求，应经常教育人民和代表如何提出和搜集提案。
