    China Construction Enterprise Company's Self-Criticism Regarding Neglecting Political Study for Cadres

    (I) Editor Comrade:

    In the "Readers' Letters" page of the People's Daily on August 8th, Comrade Liang Changmin raised a criticism regarding the China Construction Enterprise Company's employee cooperative neglecting political study for cadres. Our Education Section of the Personnel Department of the China Construction Enterprise Company should bear the primary responsibility for this issue. In the past, we reasoned that the cooperative's cadres were different in their work from other cadres in the company, that they lived in scattered locations, and that their time was difficult to manage, so we never seriously led them in political study. We did not realize that cadres cannot do their work well without studying politics. Our Education Section has already made a self-criticism regarding this, and we guarantee that we will strengthen the leadership of the cooperative's cadres in political study in the future so that the cooperative's study can be in step with the company's internal study.
                                                Education Section, Personnel Department, China Construction Enterprise Company

    (II) Editor Comrade:

    Since I started working at the China Construction Enterprise Company's employee cooperative in September 1950, I have not paid attention to leading cadres in political study. The main reason is that I did not attach importance to learning in my mind. When Liang Changmin and five other comrades spontaneously organized themselves to study the Party Constitution, I knew about it and said to them: "I hope everyone studies step by step, from the shallow to the deep; otherwise, the effect will be minimal. The leadership is now arranging to study the Patriotic Pact." But after saying this, I did not help everyone to carry out political study. I now realize that not attaching importance to political study is a manifestation of not being concerned with political tendencies, and I am determined to overcome this in the future.
                                    Wang Chunhe, Director of the Employee Cooperative of the China Construction Enterprise Company

### 中国建筑企业公司关于忽视干部政治学习的检讨

    中国建筑企业公司关于忽视干部政治学习的检讨
    （一）编辑同志：
    八月八日人民日报“读者来信专页”中，梁长敏同志对中国建筑企业公司职工合作社忽视干部政治学习问题提出了批评。对于这个问题，我们中国建筑企业公司人事室教育课首先应当负责。我们过去以合作社干部业务与公司里其他干部不同、居住分散、时间不好掌握为理由，就从来没有认真领导他们进行政治学习。我们没有认识到，干部不学习政治，就不能做好工作。我们教育课对此已作了检讨，并保证今后加强对合作社干部政治学习的领导，使合作社的学习能够和公司内部的学习步调一致。

    （二）编辑同志：
    我从一九五○年九月到中国建筑企业公司职工合作社工作后，一直没有注意领导干部政治学习。其主要原因是我思想上没有把学习重视起来。在梁长敏等五个同志自动组织起来学习党章时，我知道了，对他们说：“希望大家有步骤地学习，由浅而深；不然收效是很少的。现在领导上正布置学习爱国公约问题。”但说了以后，并没有帮助大家把政治学习搞起来。我现在认识了不重视政治学习是不问政治倾向的表现，以后一定决心克服。
            中国建筑企业公司职工合作社主任  王春和
