Column: Inventory Assets, Verify Funds, Oppose Waste!

    The Shanghai Railway Bureau has completed its asset inventory; the work of verifying funds in some of its units has also concluded. According to preliminary statistics, after this asset inventory, the bureau will submit materials worth over 200 billion yuan to the central Ministry of Railways. In the fund verification work, some units of the bureau discovered that the phenomenon of excessively occupying funds in the past was extremely serious. For example, the current assets of the Nanjing Engineering Section after fund verification were only one twenty-eighth of the original current assets, which means that the section had previously used the current assets of twenty-eight sections. The Nanjing Locomotive Section also occupied the funds of ten sections in the past.
    The reason why the bureau accumulated so much funds in the past was because some cadres had incorrect ideas of leaving a way out. For example, He Diankui, the material director of the Nanjing Rolling Stock Section, said: "We are afraid that the material supply will not keep up, which will hinder production, so we always feel that the more materials the better. Even if we receive too much, we can keep it for the next time, which is harmless." Some people think: "Anyway, the meat rots in the pot, no one takes the materials home, what are we afraid of?"
    Under the control of these incorrect ideas, the phenomenon of stockpiling materials also arose. The Nanjing Rolling Stock Section received eighty-one sets of bearing springs in the fourth quarter of last year, but only used eleven sets in the first half of this year. The Zhakou Locomotive Section of the Hangzhou Railway Sub-bureau only needs twenty superheater tubes per year, but fearing that it would not be enough, it actually stored one hundred and eighty tubes, enough for the section to use for nine years. The Shanghai Rolling Stock Section cleaned up its assets five times from March to July this year, but the "small warehouses" have not been eliminated. The Nanjing Engineering Section discovered materials worth 1.2 billion yuan off the books when cleaning up the "small warehouses." They thought it was more convenient to have the materials by their side than to have them in the leadership organ. Some units of the bureau even hid materials when cleaning up their assets. This parochialist mentality of "laying an ambush" has not been completely eradicated to this day.
    In response to these incorrect ideas, the bureau repeatedly explained the significance of clearing up assets and verifying funds, and launched a mass movement to clear up assets. When the Shangrao Locomotive Section of the Hangzhou Railway Sub-bureau began to clear up assets, the workers studied and discussed, and everyone realized that clearing up assets was like managing household affairs, and one must first clear up the family property. They immediately handed over the "small warehouses" voluntarily; some workers even returned the materials they had hidden at home to the section. Thanks to the active participation of the workers in the asset inventory work, the Zhakou Locomotive Section of the Hangzhou Railway Sub-bureau cleared out more than 300 million yuan worth of off-the-books materials. When discussing the asset inventory, the Nanjing Locomotive Section discovered that the light bulbs for locomotives received in the second half of last year were enough for six years. If these light bulbs were cashed in and deposited in the bank, the monthly interest would be enough for the section to buy light bulbs. Upon hearing this, the workers of the section immediately handed over their "small warehouses" to the higher authorities. In order to complete the task of clearing up assets ahead of schedule, the workers of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau challenged each other in groups, guaranteeing that no tool or screw would be missed, and also mobilized the family members of the workers to participate in the cleanup. The family members of the workers cleared out eight tons of scrap iron and twenty-seven tons of broken steel in two days. Li Youyong, a worker in the tool repair group of the Jinhua Locomotive Section of the Hangzhou Railway Sub-bureau, voluntarily handed over the generators he had dismantled from the Kuomintang reactionaries' military vehicles to the public. The workers in the repair group of the Nanjing Locomotive Section recognized the importance of clearing up assets and immediately cleared out more than 230 kilograms of white alloy. Because the bureau mobilized the masses to clear up assets, the bureau was able to clear out a large number of off-the-books materials and submit materials worth more than 200 billion yuan to the central Ministry of Railways for investment in other national construction projects.
    However, some units of the bureau are still occupying too much funds, so to further improve the work of verifying funds, it is necessary to continue to carry out very arduous work.

### 上海铁路局清理资产工作完成  以价值两千余亿元的材料上缴铁道部

    上海铁路局清理资产工作完成
    以价值两千余亿元的材料上缴铁道部
    上海铁路管理局清理资产的工作已经完成；该局有些单位的核定资金工作也已结束。据初步统计，该局经过这次清理资产之后，将有价值两千余亿元的材料上缴给中央铁道部。在核定资金工作中，该局有些单位发现以往过多地占用资金的现象极其严重。如该局南京工务段核定资金后的流动资金，仅为原有流动资金的二十八分之一，就是说，该段过去曾使用二十八个段的流动资金。南京机务段在过去也占用了十个段的资金。
    该局过去积压这么多资金，是因为有些干部存在着不正确的留后路的思想。例如：南京检车段材料主任贺殿魁说：“我们害怕材料供应不上，妨碍生产，所以总觉得材料越多越好，即使领多了，就可以留作下次用，不害事。”有的认为：“反正肉烂在锅里，谁也不把材料带回家去，怕什么？”
    在这些不正确思想的支配下，积压材料的现象也产生了。南京检车段去年第四季度领了八十一套轴承弹簧，直到今年上半年才用了十一套。杭州铁路分局闸口机务段每年只需要二十根过热管，但他在害怕不够用，竟存了一百八十根，足够该段用九年。上海检车段从今年三月至七月，曾经五次清理资产，但是“小仓库”仍没有消灭。南京工务段在清理“小仓库”时，发现积压了价值十二亿元的帐外材料。他们以为材料放在自己身边总比放在领导机关那里方便。该局有些单位在清理资产时，竟把材料藏起来。这种“打埋伏”的本位思想，至今还未完全肃清。
    该局针对这些不正确的思想，曾反复地说明清理资产核定资金的意义，并发动群众展开清理资产运动。杭州铁路分局上饶机务段在开始清理资产时，工友们曾进行了学习和讨论，大家认识了清理资产如同要管好家务，必先清理家当一样，立刻自动地把“小仓库”交了出来；有些工友并把过去藏在家里的材料送回段内。杭州铁路分局闸口机务段由于工人群众积极参加清理资产工作，就清理出价值三亿元以上的帐外材料。南京机务段在讨论清理资产时，发现该段去年下半年领的机车用的灯泡可以够用六年，如果把这些灯泡折价存进银行，每月所得的利息，就足够该段买灯泡了。该段工人听到了这件事情，马上就向上级交出他们的“小仓库”。南昌铁路分局工人们为了提前完成清理资产的任务，各小组相互挑战，保证不漏掉一个工具或一个螺丝，并且还带动了工人家属参加了清理工作。工人家属们在两天内就清理了八吨废铁和二十七吨碎钢。杭州铁路分局金华机务段机具包修组工人李有永主动地把过去在国民党反动派的军车上拆下来的发电机，交给了公家。南京机务段包修组工友认识了清理资产的重要性，马上就清出二百三十多公斤白合金。由于该局发动群众清理资产，因此该局能够清出大量的帐外材料，并能把价值二千余亿元的材料上缴给中央铁道部，以便投入国家其他的建设事业中。
    但是，该局有些单位还过多地占用着资金，因此要进一步做好核定资金工作，还必须继续进行很艰苦的工作。
