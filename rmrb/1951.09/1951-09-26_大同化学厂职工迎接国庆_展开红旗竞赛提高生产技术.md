    Datong Chemical Plant Workers Greet National Day
    Launch Red Flag Competition to Improve Production Technology
    All workers of the Datong Chemical Plant in Chahar launched a Red Flag competition starting September 1st to greet National Day. Preliminary checks show that great achievements have been made in the first ten days of September. The product rate of sodium sulfide maintained the new record level of July and August. Coal consumption in the drying room boiler house was reduced by 15% to 25% compared to August. The attendance rate of all workers reached as high as 99%.
    This competition, under the slogan of welcoming National Day, was launched in conjunction with the opposition to the US imperialist's separate peace treaty with Japan and the revision and implementation of patriotic pacts. The political consciousness of the workers has generally been raised a step further. The content and methods of each group's competition were decided after repeated discussions and approved by the factory management committee and the general meeting of all workers. In this movement, the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League cooperated closely and strengthened leadership, laying a good foundation for the competition movement. This Red Flag competition is different from previous simple physical labor competitions, focusing on improving technology. The workers attach great importance to this aspect. For example, the nitre boiling group of workers used to think that this work was "old-fashioned" and would not have any progress, but after discussing the competition conditions, worker Han Shun first improved the operation method, making the quality of mirabilite finer and drier than before, breaking everyone's conservative thinking. Then, the drying room also created a new operation method for reducing coal consumption. The workers in the magnesium carbonate group paid attention to uniting with technical personnel to study ways to improve the product rate of magnesium carbonate. The repair group is also conducting experiments to improve machinery.
    Currently, not only are the workers in the factory's workshops enthusiastically participating in the Red Flag competition, but even the management personnel have been swept into this competition upsurge.

    大同化学厂职工迎接国庆
    展开红旗竞赛提高生产技术
    察哈尔大同化学厂全体工人，从九月一日起展开迎接国庆日的红旗竞赛；经初步检查，在九月上旬的十天中，已获得很大成绩。硫化碱的产品率保持了七、八两月份的新纪录水平；干燥室锅炉房的煤耗比八月份降低了百分之十五至二十五；全厂工友的出勤率高达百分之九十九。
    此次竞赛是在迎接国庆日的口号下，结合了反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和，和修订与贯彻爱国公约等工作展开的。职工们的政治觉悟普遍地提高了一步。各组竞赛的内容和方法，是经过反复的讨论，由工厂管理委员会和全体工人大会通过后决定的。在这一运动中，党、行政、工会、青年团密切配合，加强领导，打下了竞赛运动的良好基础。这次红旗竞赛，与以前的单纯体力劳动竞赛不同，着重于提高技术。工人对这方面是相当重视的。比如：熬硝组工人过去一向认为这工作是“老一套”，不会有什么进展，但该组工人韩顺在讨论竞赛条件后，首先改进了操作方法，使芒硝的质量比过去又细又干，打破了大家的保守思想；接着，干燥室也创出了降低耗煤的新操作法；碳酸镁组的工友注意团结技术人员，研究提高碳酸镁产品率的方法；修理组也正在进行改进机器的试验。
    目前，不仅该厂的各车间工友正热烈地参加红旗竞赛，连管理人员也都卷入了这一竞赛的热潮。
