    We were invited by the China People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea to return from the Korean front to report to the people of the whole country on the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies fighting side by side on the front lines.
    The people of the motherland welcomed us with fiery hearts. Every day we encountered welcoming crowds of people. For example, in cities like Suzhou, Xi'an, Kunming, and Wuzhou, over 100,000 people participated in welcoming and seeing us off. Cities like Yangzhou, Wuhu, Luoyang, and Dihua, all with populations of over 100,000, saw participation rates of 70,000 to 80,000 in the welcomes. The same was true not just in cities, but in the vast countryside. For example, in the counties of western Sichuan, every village welcomed us. In the areas along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian, and mountainous areas of western Hunan, almost every village welcomed us. At a send-off rally with over 200,000 people from all walks of life in Hunan Province and Changsha City, Chairman Cheng Qian of the Military and Administrative Committee, Comrade Huang Kecheng, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Wang Shoudao and Vice Chairman Tang Shengzhi of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, and Deputy Commander Wen Niansheng of the Hunan Military Region, raised us high, carrying us from the rostrum to the train station. Chairman Cheng Qian and Comrades Wang Shoudao and Huang Kecheng said in unison, "We represent the 30 million people of Hunan to express our resolute support for you! Please tell Commander Peng and the soldiers on the front that the people of Chairman Mao's hometown are determined to give you whatever you need on the front!"
    All the grand welcome rallies were a great review of the love for the motherland and the love for the Volunteers by millions of people, and they were the greatest encouragement and best education for us. We, the Volunteers, are the loyal sons and daughters of the people of the motherland, and will always be the defenders of the interests of the motherland and the people. If the enemy does not abandon his plans of aggression and is determined to persist in aggression, then we must more resolutely and bravely cooperate with the Korean People's Army to crush any enemy offensive.
    The people of the motherland, with the concern of relatives, have universally launched enthusiastic consolation movements. Just what we personally received in various places amounted to 11.9 billion yuan in consolation money, over 500,000 letters of consolation, over 200,000 items of consolation goods, over 100,000 consolation bags, as well as a large number of books, newspapers, and many valuable gifts. We visited over 100 ethnic groups in the Northwest and Southwest, and they all gave the Volunteers their most precious gifts. Tibetan compatriots in Qinghai presented us with the most esteemed Hada; Hui people presented us with hats and waist knives in the style of those worn by Muhammad. We also received dozens of Youth League flags and hundreds of red scarves from children's teams from various places given to the Volunteers.
    We received over 20,000 bouquets of flowers throughout the country. These flowers are symbols of victory and glory. This victory and glory belongs to our great motherland, to all patriotic people, and to our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, workers across the country have launched patriotic production competitions. We saw that workers at the Huainan and Pingxiang coal mines used new technologies and demonstrated a high degree of initiative, with the highest daily coal production record for each group exceeding 250 tons. During our week in Nanchang, coal consumption at the Nanchang Hydropower Plant decreased by 11%. The Nanchang Water Company increased its installation rate of water pipes from 40 meters per day to over 185 meters per day within three weeks. Many workers worked while ill, saying, "The Volunteers don't leave the front lines even when wounded, so what's a little illness to us!" We visited several factories in Sichuan and Hunan and found that their output had generally increased by over 300% since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The speed of diesel engine manufacturing at the No. 2 Machine Factory of the Jinan Industrial Bureau was more than four times higher in March than before the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. These rapidly changing production records are inseparable from the creative labor of the workers. Zhou Wangcheng, a worker at the Shantou Telecommunications Bureau, wrote to us that during the patriotic competition, technician Lu Shanhai invented a method for renewing telegraph paper, with a cost equivalent to one-thousandth of the original value. We saw Xiang Gongzhu, an engineer at the Guangdong State-Owned Transportation Company, invent an automatic unloading truck that could unload goods in three minutes that originally took three hours. At the Zhuzhou Railway Factory, we saw old worker Shao Tainuan using waste materials to make his own electric meter, equivalent to one-twentieth of the original value. Shao Tainuan's father had worked for over 50 years, and he had worked for 36 years, but had never invented anything and was illiterate. Now he had five inventions in half a year. Since the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the factory has had 105 officially approved inventions from higher authorities.
    Since the China People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued the three major calls on June 1, workers in various places have responded enthusiastically. During our stay in Guangzhou, the city's workers had increased production and donated 11.4 billion yuan, almost one-third of the city's total of 35.8 billion yuan. Changsha donated a total of 21 airplanes, of which workers donated 9. The 6,000 workers of the Liuzhou Railway Sub-bureau decided to increase production and donate 30 airplanes by the end of the year.
    Guangxi Province originally planned to donate 26 airplanes. But at a Resist America, Aid Korea representatives' meeting, one representative said, "Since the liberation of Guangxi Province, bandits have been wiped out, which is a great favor from the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army. Now the Volunteers are fighting bloody battles in Korea to defend the victory of the revolution. If each of the 20 million people in Guangxi Province increases production and donates nine eggs (worth 3,000 yuan), that would be 60 billion yuan, which could buy 40 fighter planes!" The entire audience applauded and approved the motion. Later, the entire province of Guangxi donated 52 airplanes, exceeding the original plan by one time. Xiangtan City has only 100,000 people, but within a week, the cash donations put into storage reached 1.5 billion yuan. The people of Xiangtan cheered, "The first 'Mao Zedong Hometown' plane is completed!"
    To defend the motherland, countless young people across the country are enthusiastically going to the national defense front lines. When we were in East China, many young workers and students asked us every day to take them to Korea. When we were in Hankou, 2,400 people signed up for military cadre schools within three days. After we left, the number of applicants reached over 17,000. Over 80,000 middle and high school students in Hunan Province have participated in revolutionary work since liberation, and they are still enthusiastically participating in military cadre schools this time.
    When we were in Nanchang, we saw that over 17,000 people signed up to donate blood within three days. Baotou Middle School organized a blood donation team. Five hundred young people in Gui Sui donated 10,000 cc of blood, which was stored in the blood bank.
    In the military cadre school movement, Huang Yalan, a military dependent in Zhenjiang City, gave all seven of her children to the country, becoming a mother loved by the people. Zhang Zhiyun, a military dependent in Changsha City, is the mother of nine revolutionary children. She said, "The children are not mine personally, the children belong to the country. To make the motherland prosperous and safe, we must contribute our children to the motherland."
    These shining examples are the glory of our motherland! And also the glory of mothers!
    The people of the motherland and the People's Government have made remarkable achievements in taking care of the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and the families of revolutionary workers. For example, in the past year, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government introduced jobs to 2,217 families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers, allocated 800,000 catties of millet to help the families of martyrs and military personnel with production, organized 22 production groups, repaired 250 houses for 532 families of martyrs and military personnel, and helped the children of 1,055 families of martyrs and military personnel to attend school for free. Since the China People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued the three major calls on June 1, preferential treatment work has been more widely emphasized. For example, the Changsha business community decided to give families of martyrs and military personnel a 25% discount on purchases, the theater community held benefit performances, and the barber union decided to take turns giving free haircuts to families of martyrs and military personnel.
    We thank the People's Government and all the people for their care and preferential treatment of the families of martyrs and military personnel. We will definitely work harder and repay you with actions to resolutely defend the motherland and the people.
    We saw vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries throughout the country. In the hundreds of letters we received, many people reported to us on their work in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. For example, Chen Yi, a student at the Suzhou Nanyang Advanced Midwifery School, accused his father. Wu Jiangyun, a student at Hangzhou High School, accused his counter-revolutionary parents. More than 800 people quit the Yiguandao in one day in the Dafu section of Chongqing City. Patriotic Catholics and Christians are carrying out the Three-Self Reform Movement to sever ties with imperialism. Recently, Catholic priests in Chongqing refused to accept more than 10 million US dollars sent from Hong Kong by American imperialists. Church members participate in production on their own, some twisting hemp ropes and weaving straw sandals. They said, "We would rather twist hemp ropes and weave straw sandals than take American dirty money!"
    The above examples prove that our Volunteers cooperated with the Korean People's Army to win battles on the Korean front, and the people of the motherland also won battles in the rear. Although our combat posts are different, we are all resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. The victories on our front encouraged the rear, and the victories in the rear equally encouraged the front. Our motherland is becoming stronger and stronger day by day.
    We, the Chinese People's Volunteers, will always be the most loyal defenders of the people of the motherland. If the American imperialists do not abandon their plans of aggression, then we will more resolutely stand at the forefront of the anti-aggression struggle. To defend our sacred land, to defend all our cities, villages, factories, schools, hospitals, railways, and mines from destruction, to defend our millions of fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and sisters from bullying, to defend the fruits of our revolutionary victory, to defend human civilization, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, we vow to persevere in the struggle to the end!

    我们伟大的祖国和人民万岁！
    ——志愿军归国代表柴川若在中央人民广播电台的广播词摘要
    我们应中国人民抗美援朝总会的邀请，从朝鲜前线回国，向全国人民报告中朝人民军队在前线并肩作战的英勇事迹。
    祖国人民以火热的心情欢迎我们。我们每天遇到人山人海的欢迎队伍。例如，苏州、西安、昆明、梧州等城都是十余万人参加欢迎欢送，扬州、芜湖、洛阳、迪化，都是十万多人的城市，而参加欢迎的人数达七八万。除了城市以外，广大农村也是一样。例如川西各县，村村欢迎。苏北沿江地区、广东、福建沿海地区，及湘西山区，几乎所有的村庄都欢迎。在湖南省和长沙市各界二十余万人的欢送大会上，军政委员会程潜主席，中国共产党湖南省委员会书记黄克诚同志，湖南省人民政府王首道主席、唐生智副主席、省军区文年生副司令员等，把我们高高举起，从主席台送到火车站上。程潜主席和王首道、黄克诚同志异口同声地说：“我们代表三千万湖南人民，表示坚决支援你们；请你们告诉彭司令员和前方将士们说，毛主席故乡的人民都下了决心，前方要什么，我们就给什么！”
    所有盛大的欢迎会，都是千百万人民热爱祖国、热爱志愿军的大检阅，都是对我们最大的鼓励和最好的教育。我们志愿军是祖国人民忠实的儿女，永远是祖国和人民利益的保卫者，如果敌人不放弃他的侵略计划，决心坚持侵略到底，那么我们一定要更加坚决勇敢地配合朝鲜人民军，粉碎敌人的任何进攻。
    祖国人民以关怀亲人的心情，普遍展开了热烈的慰劳运动。仅是我们在各地亲手收到的，就有慰劳金一百一十九亿，慰劳信五十余万封，慰劳品二十余万件，慰劳袋十万余个，还有大批的书籍、报纸以及许多贵重的礼品。我们在西北、西南访问了一百多种兄弟民族，他们都送给志愿军最贵重的礼品。青海的藏族同胞，向我们献赠最尊贵的哈达；回族人民赠送了穆罕默德戴过的那种样式的帽子和腰刀。我们还收到各地青年团送给志愿军的数十面团旗和少年儿童队送给我们的数百幅红领巾。
    我们在全国各地，共收到两万余束鲜花。这些鲜花是胜利与光荣的象征。这个胜利和光荣，是属于我们伟大的祖国，是属于全体爱国的人民，是属于我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的！
    自从开展抗美援朝运动以来，全国工人们展开了爱国主义生产大竞赛。我们看到淮南煤矿和萍乡煤矿的工人们运用新的技术，发挥了高度积极性，每个小组每日采煤量的最高纪录都超过二百五十吨。我们在南昌的一周内，南昌水电厂锅炉煤耗降低了百分之十一。长沙自来水公司在三周以内，由每天安四十公尺自来水管，提高到每天安一百八十五公尺以上。许多工友抱病工作，他们说：“志愿军负了伤都不下火线，咱们生一点小病算什么！”我们在四川和湖南，参观了几个工厂，发现他们自从开展抗美援朝运动以来，产量一般提高了百分之三百以上。济南工业局第二机器厂制造柴油机的速度，在三月间就比抗美援朝运动前提高了四倍以上。上述这些日新月异的生产纪录是与工人们的创造性的劳动分不开的，汕头电信局工人周旺成给我们来信说，该局在爱国主义竞赛中，技术员陆山海发明了电报纸翻新法，成本相当原值的千分之一。我们看到广东国营运输公司工程师向恭柱发明自动卸货车，三分钟内可卸原来需要三个钟头的货物。我们在株州铁路工厂，看到老工人邵泰暖利用废料自制电表，相当于原值的二十分之一。邵泰暖的父亲做了五十多年工，他做了三十六年工，但是过去没有发明，而且不识字，现在在半年内有了五种发明。该厂自抗美援朝运动以来，经过上级机关正式批准的发明，就有一百零五种。
    自从中国人民抗美援朝总会六月一日发出三大号召以来，各地工人纷纷热烈响应。我们在广州期间，全市工人增产捐献已达一百一十四亿元，几乎占全市三百五十八亿元的三分之一。长沙共捐献二十一架飞机，其中工人捐献的就占九架。柳州铁路分局六千工人，决定到年底增产捐献飞机三十架。
    广西省原先计划捐献二十六架飞机。但在一次抗美援朝代表会上，一位代表说：“广西省解放以来，肃清了土匪，这是共产党毛主席和人民政府、人民解放军的大恩典。现在志愿军正在朝鲜浴血奋战，保卫革命的胜利，我们全广西二千万人民，只要每人增产捐献九个鸡蛋（值三千元），就是六百亿元，就可买四十架战斗机！”全场一致鼓掌通过。后来全广西省捐献了五十二架飞机，超过最初计划的一倍。湘潭市只有十万人口，但在一周内捐献入库的现款就达十五亿元。湘潭人民发出了欢呼：“第一架毛泽东故乡号完成了！”
    为了保卫祖国，全国无数青年踊跃走上国防前线。我们在华东的时候，每天都有很多青年工人和学生要求我们把他带到朝鲜去。我们在汉口的时候，三天之内，就有二千四百人报名参加军事干部学校。我们走了之后，报名人数达到一万七千余人。湖南全省大、中学生，自解放以来，已有八万余人参加革命工作，此次参加军事干部学校，仍很踊跃。
    我们在南昌的时候，看到三天之内，就有一万七千余人报名输血。包头中学组织了输血大队。归绥五百位青年输血一万西西，存入了血库。
    在参加军事干部学校运动中，镇江市军属黄亚兰，把七个子女一齐交给国家，成为被人民热爱的母亲。长沙市军属张志云，她是一位九个革命孩子的母亲。她说：“孩子不是我个人的，孩子是国家的。要祖国得到富强安全，只有把孩子贡献给祖国。”
    这些光辉的范例，是我们祖国的光荣！也是母亲的光荣！
    祖国人民和人民政府对待革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属的照顾，已经做出显著成绩。例如天津市人民政府在去年一年中给二千二百一十七位烈属、军属、工属介绍了职业，拨出八十万斤小米来帮助烈属、军属生产，共组织了二十二个生产小组，给五百三十二个烈属、军属修了二百五十间房子，帮助一千零五十五个烈属、军属的子弟免费入学。自从中国人民抗美援朝总会六月一日发出三大号召以后，优抚工作更加普遍地被重视起来。如长沙市工商界决议烈属、军属买东西打七五折，戏剧界进行慰问义演，理发工会决定轮流给烈属、军属免费理发。
    我们感谢人民政府与全体人民对烈属、军属的照顾与优待，我们一定加倍努力，用坚决保卫祖国和人民的行动来报答你们。
    我们在全国各地看到大张旗鼓地镇压反革命。在我们收到的千百封信件中，很多人向我们报告了他们镇压反革命工作的情况。例如苏州南洋高级助产学校学员陈衣控诉了他的父亲。杭州高中吴绛云同学控诉了他的反革命的父母。重庆市大付段在一天内就有八百多人退出一贯道。爱国的天主教徒和基督教徒在实行三自革新运动，与帝国主义斩断联系。最近重庆天主教神甫，拒绝接受美帝国主义者由香港寄来的一千余万元美金。教友们自己动手参加生产，有的就搓麻绳打草鞋。他们说：“我们情愿搓麻绳打草鞋，也不要美国的臭钱！”
    上述种种事例证明，我们志愿军配合朝鲜人民军在朝鲜前线打了胜仗，祖国人民在后方也同样打了胜仗。我们的战斗岗位虽然不同，但都是为了抗美援朝保家卫国，我们前方的胜利鼓励了后方，后方的胜利同样鼓励了前方，我们的祖国是一天比一天地壮大、坚强了。
    我们中国人民志愿军永远是祖国人民的最忠实的保卫者。如果美帝国主义者不放弃他们的侵略计划，那么我们就更坚决地站在反侵略斗争的最前线，为了保卫我们神圣的国土，为了保卫我们所有城市、村庄、工厂、学校、医院、铁路和矿山不受破坏，为了保卫我们千千万万父亲、母亲、哥哥、弟弟、姊姊和妹妹不受欺凌，为了保卫我们革命的胜利果实，为了保卫人类的文明，为了保卫远东与世界的和平，我们誓必坚持不懈地奋斗到底！（新华社）
