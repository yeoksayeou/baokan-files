    Beijing's Resist America, Aid Korea Literary and Artistic Creation Movement
    Huang Zhen, Bing De
    In carrying out literary and artistic propaganda for the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, the literary and artistic circles of Beijing launched a mass literary creation movement. Many workers, students, literary and artistic workers, and performers participated in this movement, providing a large amount of material for the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and cultivating a large number of active literary creation participants.
    In April, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Beijing Popular Literature and Art Creation Research Association, planned and mobilized their members to actively engage in patriotic literary and artistic creation; at the same time, through the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Department of Culture and Education, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's Department of Literature and Art, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Suburban Work Committee of the Communist Party of China, and various People's Cultural Centers, they separately mobilized activists among workers, students, peasants, and urban residents to carry out mass literary creation. During this period, a large number of works were produced, compiled by the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Popular Literature and Art Creation Research Association, and successively published in the Xinmin Bao and Guangming Daily or printed as mimeographed copies for everyone to read or sing. From April 7 to May 1, a total of 108 kinds of works were published (ballads accounting for five-tenths, drama accounting for three-tenths, and poetry accounting for two-tenths), of which 69 kinds were published in newspapers, mainly the creations of workers, peasants, students, and general literary and artistic workers in the city. These works all focused on the heroic battles of the Chinese and Korean People's forces on the Korean front, the active production of the broad masses of people in the rear, supporting the front, as well as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, opposing the United States' arming of Japan, and strengthening the unity of people from all walks of life. These works are all popular, suitable for singing, and even illiterate people can understand them.
    These works were recommended by the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Popular Literature and Art Creation Research Association, and were widely adopted in the popular Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda movement in April and the subsequent in-depth Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work, becoming important materials in the Resist America, Aid Korea literary and artistic propaganda.
    While the above-mentioned movement was carried out, under the auspices of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Municipal Student Federation, workers and students in Beijing held literary creation competitions separately; in May, a performance was held. A total of 535 works by workers participated in the creation competition, and 42 won awards; according to statistics from 32 schools, student literary creations reached 799, and 34 won awards. In late June and early July, the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles and relevant agencies held award ceremonies for workers' and students' literary creations and performance viewings.
    Some of the excellent popular works produced in this movement have been accepted by professional or amateur literary and artistic groups and have become frequently performed materials. For example, ballads such as "Flames of Anger," "Singing General Kim Il-sung," "Flying Tiger Mountain," and "Such is America," were taken to the Korean front and Xinjiang and other places by Beijing artists from the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea Performing Arts Service Team, and were welcomed by frontline soldiers and the broad masses of people everywhere. The drama "Calculate It," created by workers at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, played a certain role in promoting economic accounting, and is now widely used by amateur railway drama troupes in Northeast China, Tianjin, and other places. The "Resist America, Aid Korea Clapper Talk" created by Li Chuanxiu, a student at Normal University, has been performed more than 60 times in Beijing. There are also some works with very good content, such as the radio play "Endless Good News," which has been adapted into a Ping opera by the New China Ping Opera Troupe. "Sister-in-law Liu Si" is a Ping opera, and the Youth Art Theater has re-arranged it into a new opera for performance.
    Another gain of this creation movement is that it has enabled many professional or amateur literary and artistic groups to more deeply recognize their creative abilities, and they have begun to engage in creation themselves, no longer simply relying on materials published by bookstores. At the same time, it has also enabled some professional literary and artistic workers to begin to cooperate with the broad masses of workers and peasants and artists. For example, the relatively excellent work "Good Couple" (clapper talk drama) in this creation was written by literary and artistic workers going down to the factory and cooperating with workers. In June, opera artists and literary and artistic workers cooperated to write the Ping opera "Artistic Sea of Deep Hatred."
    More importantly, through this movement, a large number of active literary and artistic workers have emerged among the broad masses of workers, students, peasants, urban residents, and artists. In order to cultivate and improve this group of activists, relevant leading agencies have absorbed them to study at the Beijing Amateur Art School. In the past, only more than 1,200 people participated in the school, but now it has grown to more than 3,300.

    北京市的抗美援朝文艺创作运动
    黄真·秉德
    在开展抗美援朝文艺宣传工作中，北京市文艺界发动了群众性的文艺创作运动。许多工人、学生、文艺工作者和艺人参加了这一运动，为抗美援朝宣传提供了大量的材料，并培养了大批文艺创作的积极分子。
    四月里，北京市文学艺术工作者联合会和北京大众文艺创作研究会，有计划地发动了自己的会员积极从事爱国主义的文艺创作；同时并通过市总工会文教部、青年团市委文艺部、中共北京市郊区工作委员会宣传部和各人民文化馆等，分别发动工人、学生、农民和城市居民中的积极分子进行群众性的文艺创作。这期间产生了大量的作品，经市文联与大众文艺创作研究会编选，陆续在新民报和光明日报发表或印成油印本，供大家阅读或演唱。自四月七日至五月一日，共发表了一百零八种作品
    （曲艺占十分之五，戏剧占十分之三，诗歌占十分之二），其中在报纸上发表的有六十九种，主要是本市工人、农民、学生和一般文艺工作者的创作。这些作品都以朝鲜前线中朝人民部队的英勇作战，后方广大人民的积极生产、支援前线以及镇压反革命、反对美国武装日本、加强各界人民的团结等为主题。这些作品都是通俗的，适合演唱，不识字的人也可以听得懂。
    这些作品经市文联与大众文艺创作研究会的推荐，在四月份的普及抗美援朝宣传运动及以后的深入抗美援朝宣传工作中，为各方面广泛采用，成为抗美援朝文艺宣传中的重要材料。
    与上述运动开展的同时，在市文联、市总工会、青年团市委、市学联等团体的主持下，北京市工人、学生又分别举行了文艺创作的竞赛；五月份又举行了观摩演出。参加创作竞赛的工人作品共有五百三十五件，有四十二件得奖；学生中的文艺创作，据三十二个学校统计，共达七百九十九件，有三十四件得奖。六月下旬和七月初，市文联与有关机关曾分别举行了工人、学生文艺创作与观摩演出的发奖大会。
    这次运动所产生的一部分优秀的通俗的作品，已为专业文艺团体或业余文艺团体所接受，成为经常演唱的材料。如曲艺“愤怒的火焰”、“歌唱金日成将军”、“飞虎山”、“如此美国”等，中国人民赴朝慰问团曲艺服务大队的北京艺人曾带这些节目到朝鲜前线和新疆等地演唱，获得了前线战士和各地广大人民的欢迎。丰台机务段工人创作的话剧“算一算”，对宣传经济核算制起了一定的作用，目前东北、天津等地铁路业余剧团已广泛地采用。师范大学学生李传琇创作的“抗美援朝快板”，已在北京市演出六十多次。还有一些内容很好的作品，如播音剧“喜事说不完”，已为新中华评剧团改编成评剧演出。“刘四嫂”是评剧，青年艺术剧院曾将它重新配曲成为新歌剧来演出。
    这次创作运动的另一收获，是使许多专业的或业余的文艺团体，更深地认识了自己的创造能力，自己开始从事创作，不再单纯地依靠书店出版的材料。同时，也使一部分专业文艺工作者开始与广大工农群众和艺人合作。如这次创作中比较优秀的作品“好夫妻”（快板剧），就是文艺工作者下厂与工人合作写出的。六月份，戏曲界艺人与文艺工作者合作写出了评剧“艺海深仇”。
    更重要的，是通过这次运动，在广大的工人、学生、农民、城市居民与艺人之间，涌现出了大批的文艺工作的积极分子。为了培养与提高这批积极分子，有关领导机关已吸收他们到北京市业余艺术学校学习。该校以前参加学习的只有一千二百多人，现在已发展到三千三百多人。
