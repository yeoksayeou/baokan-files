Correcting the Ideology of Focusing Only on Production and Not on Management
——Preliminary Inspection of Asset Clearance and Capital Verification by the North China Textile Administration Bureau
By Liu Zaisheng, Director of the North China Textile Administration Bureau

The work of asset clearance and capital verification in the state-owned factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau has been fully launched; the clearance and review of assets is nearing completion. Recently, we inspected the asset clearance work of several factories. The results of the inspection not only demonstrated the necessity of asset clearance and capital verification but also indicated that the ideology of focusing only on production and not on management in factory management must be overcome. Many valuable materials have become waste due to long-term accumulation.

The phenomenon of idle circulating funds is mainly reflected in materials. To illustrate the severity of the backlog, I will briefly cite a few actual examples:

The No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory discovered more than ninety boxes of weaving machine parts for twill fabric during asset review, which were not recorded in the accounts in the past. For these ninety boxes of parts, no one had ever asked about them, let alone cleared them. As a result, these ninety boxes of usable parts were abandoned in the warehouse for as long as two years. This is the first type of asset backlog.

The No. 2 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory found an extra 1,000 kW generator during inventory of materials. It is said that this large generator was discarded as waste in the yard of the Kuomintang's "Central Textile Factory No. 7" and was allocated to the No. 2 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory for dismantling as parts. However, upon inspection, it was found that the generator could be used with some repairs. This generator is worth more than 10 billion yuan. Treating usable machines as waste is the second type of backlog.

All factories have inventoried many transformers and motors. The No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory has three 200 kW transformers; the No. 2 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory found more than 240 motors in the power department alone; the No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory has 400 motors awaiting repair scattered everywhere. However, before this, the Machinery and Materials Department of the North China Textile Administration Bureau was still continuously purchasing transformers and motors. This is the third type of backlog.

The No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory has a large number of chemical drugs left over from the Japanese occupation. Now, these drugs, such as hydrogen peroxide, have deteriorated. The No. 2 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory has accumulated a large amount of wood, of which 1,500 square feet have decayed due to wind and rain. Many valuable materials like these have become waste due to long-term accumulation, which is the fourth type of backlog. Each factory uses the material expenses of more than two factories.

The above four situations show that we have not only accumulated a large amount of state funds but also allowed some useful materials to gradually become waste. This is a serious waste phenomenon! If we calculate the total amount of the backlog, it would be even more shocking. The total amount of scrap iron accumulated in each factory reaches 100 tons, some of which are usable parts. The stock of iron wire in the No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Machinery Factory is enough for the factory to use for one hundred years; the stock of carbon steel is also enough for more than ten years. The total value of materials (including waste) accumulated by the state-owned factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau is one to two times more than the total value of materials that each factory should consume. That is to say, like the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the circulating funds occupied by the material expenses of each of our factories are largely enough for the needs of two similar factories, and in some cases even more.

In addition to the phenomenon of idle circulating funds, we also found many problems in the management of fixed assets during this inspection.

When the No. 3 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory inventoried buildings last year, the value of some workshops was underestimated, which was only corrected during the current review. Many factories found some new "small houses" during this review. Where did these "small houses" come from? According to understanding, they are the products of "loose budgeting" in the past construction budgets. Not only has the efficiency of mechanical equipment not been well utilized, but some machines have even disappeared.

Many extremely unreasonable situations were also found during the inventory of mechanical equipment: the No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory was missing a loom, which was said to have been borrowed by the No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Machinery Factory as a sample. The No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Machinery Factory had already dismantled the loom into parts, and it could not be found. However, the No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory had an extra loom, which was originally sent by the No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Machinery Factory as a sample, but now it has become the asset of the No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory in a haphazard manner. In addition, the No. 3 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory also had ten extra heald drawing machines during inventory. These examples are enough to show that in the past, some factories only focused on completing production tasks and did not pay attention to whether all mechanical equipment had exerted its capabilities, which is a serious situation.

This simple view of completing production tasks has caused serious losses in business operations, which is also clearly manifested in the No. 1 State-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Machinery Factory. The factory has accumulated a large number of substandard finished products, of which there are 60,000 yarn tubes alone, estimated to be worth more than 100 million yuan. In addition, it has also accumulated 200 sets of waste rollers, more than 20 tons of screws, and so on. The factory loses 700 yuan for each shuttle sold. The price of each drawing frame manufactured by the factory is also more than 10 million yuan higher than the price stipulated by the Central Textile Department. In the past, the factory turned a blind eye to these phenomena, only knowing how to produce as usual, without trying to reduce the cost of products. The supply system ideology is the root cause of waste.

The above facts are enough to show that the supply system ideology of "only focusing on production and not on management" in our factory management is very serious. This ideology is mainly reflected in two aspects:

First, some cadres are only enthusiastic about organizing production and launching competitions, and do not care about the factory's assets and funds. Some cadres believe that the basic task of the factory is production, and the asset bloating and fund waste left over from the past bureaucratic capitalist enterprises can be ignored. Therefore, they are indifferent to how the materials in the warehouse are piled up randomly, causing corrosion and damage. Some cadres believe that the more materials are accumulated, the more convenient it will be to use. They believe that as long as it is "beneficial" to production, it does not matter to accumulate funds. Therefore, although there are a large number of stagnant materials in the warehouse, they still try their best to purchase in large quantities, create more budgets, and "lay more ambushes" in order to be "prepared for any eventuality."

Second, some cadres believe that state-owned enterprises do not need to compete with anyone and do not have to worry about losses. They believe that once the finished products are out, no matter what the cost, there will naturally be sales. Therefore, they only care about producing finished products, but completely ignore whether they are losing money. When funds are insufficient, they only ask for money from above, without carefully studying whether there is waste.

These two ideologies are basically the same, both starting only from a partial point of view, only seeing the production of their own factory, and not seeing the overall economic situation of the country and the future economic construction prospects of the country. This is a violation of the socialist nature of the operating principles of state-owned enterprises.

Struggle against the ideology of incorrectly treating asset clearance and capital verification!

After the clearance and review of assets, the serious phenomena of fund accumulation and waste are clearly placed in front of every factory manager; the ideology of "only focusing on production and not on management" has been strongly criticized by the facts. Judging from the progress of asset clearance and capital verification, although the leading cadres of some factories have begun to pay attention to this work, there are still some ideological problems that need to be resolved.

The cadres of some factories are not thinking about how to save more state funds in asset clearance and capital verification, or how to fully utilize the efficiency of existing equipment, but are thinking about clearing out all the broken machine parts and materials in the factory through asset clearance, so as to reduce responsibility and be light and free. Therefore, their principle is: send out the bad ones, and "ambush" the good ones.

The cadres of some factories are not carefully calculating how much equipment and funds are needed, but are still imagining countless times: "Even if there are financial difficulties in the future, there will still be credit support." Therefore, they hold a passive attitude of indifference to the current asset clearance and capital verification work.

The leading cadres of some factories are busy all day long solving large and small trivial problems, but for this important work that determines the future of the entire factory and even the national economic construction, they emphasize that they do not have the time and strength to personally grasp it. Some even think that this work is only a technical matter for the accounting, machinery, and materials departments, so some only listen to reports, and some do not even listen to reports.

The above-mentioned ideologies are the manifestations of the past daily work from a partial point of view, the ideology of only focusing on production and not on management in asset clearance and capital verification. We must resolutely fight against these ideologies in order to do a good job in asset clearance and capital verification and to further promote factory production.

    纠正只问生产不问经营的思想
    ——华北纺织管理局对清理资产核定资金工作的初步检查
    华北纺织管理局局长  刘再生
    华北纺织管理局所属各国营工厂清理资产核定资金的工作，已经全面展开；清理和复查资产的工作已经接近结束。最近，我们曾检查了几个工厂清理资产工作的情况。检查的结果，不仅说明了清理资产核定资金这个工作是十分必要的，而且也说明了在工厂管理中只问生产不问经营的思想是必须克服的。许多宝贵材料因积压年久而
    成为废物。
    我们的流动资金积压的现象，主要表现在材料方面。为了说明积压现象的严重性，我简单地举出几个实际事例：
    国营天津第一棉纺织厂在覆查资产中发现了九十多箱织斜纹布用的织机机件，是过去账上根本没有的。对于这九十多箱机件，过去居然没有人过问，当然也谈不到清理了。于是，这九十多箱可用的机件弃置在仓库里，竟达两年之久。这是资产积压中的第一种情况。
    国营天津第二棉纺织厂在清理资材中多出了一台一千瓩的发电机。据说：这架大发电机过去在国民党“中纺七厂”是当作废料扔在院子里的，调拨到国营天津第二棉纺织厂原是准备拆开作为零件用的。但后来一检查，发现这台发电机只要加以检修，就可以使用。这台发电机价值百亿元之多。把有用的机器当作废料，这是积压中的第二种情况。
    各厂都清点出不少的变压器、马达。国营天津第一棉纺织厂有三个二百瓩的变压器；国营天津第二棉纺织厂仅仅在原动部即查出二百四十多个马达；国营天津印染厂随地弃置的待修的马达就有四百个。但在此以前，华北纺织管理局机料处还不断地购买变压器、马达。这是积压中的第三种情况。
    国营天津印染厂存有大批日寇遗留下来的化学药品。现在这些药品，如双氧水等等，都已变质。国营天津第二棉纺织厂堆积着大批木材，其中已有一千五百平方尺，因风吹雨淋而腐朽了。像这样许多宝贵的材料，因积压年久而成废料，这是第四种情况。每个工厂用着两个以上工厂
    的材料费。
    以上这四种情况，说明了我们不仅积压了国家大批的资金，而且使得有些有用资材逐渐成了废物。这是何等严重的浪费现象！如果计算一下积压的总数，那就更惊人了。各厂积压的废铁，总数竟达一百吨，其中有些本是可用的机件。在国营天津棉纺机械厂，积存的铁丝可足供该厂使用一百年；积存的碳钢也可用十余年左右。华北纺织管理局所属各国营工厂积压的材料总值（包括废料），比各厂应该消耗的材料总值要多出一倍到两倍。这就是说，我们和石景山钢铁厂一样，我们每个厂材料费所占用的流动资金，大都也足够同样的两个厂的需要，有的甚至还要超过。
    除流动资金积压的现象而外，在固定资产的管理上，我们在此次检查中也发现了不少问题。
    国营天津第三棉纺织厂去年清点房屋建筑时，有些工房的价值都少算了，直到现在覆查时才纠正。不少工厂在这次覆查时，发现了一些新的“小房子”。这些“小房子”是那儿来的呢？据了解，是过去建筑预算中“宽打窄用”的产物。不仅没有很好地发挥机械设
    备的效能，有的机器都找
    不到踪影了。
    在清理机械设备时，也发现很多极不合理的情况：国营天津第一棉纺织厂少了一台织布机，据说是被国营天津棉纺机械厂借去当作标本用的。国营天津棉纺机械厂早已把这台织布机拆成零件，找不到踪影了。可是国营天津第一棉纺织厂又多出了一台织布机，这一台本来是国营天津棉纺机械厂送来做样品的，现在却胡乱地成为国营天津第一棉纺织厂的资产了。此外，国营天津第三棉纺织厂清理时，也多出十台穿扣机。这些例子足够说明，过去有些工厂只问生产任务的完成，而不问机械设备是否都已发挥其能力的情况是严重的。
    这种单纯地完成生产任务的观点，在企业经营上所造成的严重亏累，在国营天津棉纺机械厂也很明显地表现出来。该厂积压大批的不够规格的成品，其中仅纱管就有六万个，估计约值一亿多元。此外，还积压废罗拉二百套，螺丝二十多吨等等。该厂所制梭子，售出时每个亏损七百元。该厂制造的并条机的每台价格也较中央纺织部规定的价格高出一千余万元。过去该厂对于这些现象不闻不问，只知道照样地生产，而不想办法去降低产品的成本。供给制思想是产生浪费现象
    的根源。
    上述种种事实，足以说明我们在工厂管理中的“只管生产不问经营”的供给制思想是十分严重的。这种思想主要表现在两方面：
    第一是有些干部只热心于组织生产和发动竞赛，而不关心工厂的资产资金情况。有些干部以为工厂的基本任务是生产，对于过去官僚资本主义企业所遗留下来的资产臃肿和资金浪费的现象，则可以不闻不问，因此尽管仓库的材料怎样胡乱堆积，以致腐蚀损坏，他们也无动于衷。有些干部则以为材料积存得越多，使用时就越方便。认为只要对生产“有利”，积压资金是不在乎的。因此仓库里虽然存有大量的呆滞材料，但他们仍然千方百计地大量采购，多造预算，多“打埋伏”，以期“有备无患”。
    第二是有些干部以为国营企业既不需要和谁竞争，又不必担心亏本。以为成品出来，不管成本如何，自然会有销路。因此他们只管出产成品，却全然不顾是否亏本。资金不够时，只管向上要钱，也不仔细研究是否浪费。
    这两种思想基本上是一样的，都是仅仅从局部观点出发、只看到本厂的生产，而看不到国家全面的经济情况和国家未来经济建设的前途。这是违反社会主义性质的国营企业的经营方针的。与不正确对待清理资产核定
    资金工作的思想作斗争！
    在清理和覆查资产后，严重的资金积压和浪费的现象明显地摆在每个工厂管理者的面前；“只问生产不问经营”的思想受到了事实的有力的批判。从清理资产核定资金工作进行的情况看来，虽然有些工厂的领导干部已经开始重视这个工作，但还有一些思想问题需要解决。
    有的工厂的干部不是想在清理资产核定资金中如何更多地去节省国家资金，如何充分地发挥现有设备效率，而是想通过清理资产把厂内的一切破烂机件材料清除出去，可以减轻责任，轻快自在。因此他们的原则是：不好的送出去，好的“埋伏”下来。
    有的工厂的干部不是精细地计算究竟需要多少设备、多少资金，而仍然是心中无数地想像：“即使将来资金困难，也还有信贷支持。”因此对目前的清理资产核定资金工作抱着无可无不可的消极态度。
    某些厂的领导干部整天辛辛苦苦地忙于解决大大小小的零碎问题，对于这个决定整个工厂以至全国经济建设前途的重要工作，却强调没有时间和没有力量去亲自掌握。有的甚至以为这个工作仅仅是会计、机料等部门的技术性的事情，因此他们有的只听听汇报，有的甚至连汇报也不听。
    上述的几种思想，乃是过去日常工作中从局部观点出发的、只问生产不问经营的思想在清理资产核定资金工作中的表现。必须坚决地向这些思想作斗争，才能做好清理资产核定资金工作，才能把工厂生产工作推进一步。
