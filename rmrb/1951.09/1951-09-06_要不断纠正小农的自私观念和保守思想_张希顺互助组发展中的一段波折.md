    Constantly Correct the Selfish Concepts and Conservative Ideas of Small Farmers
    ——A Twist in the Development of Zhang Xishun's Mutual Aid Team
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Jianwei

    The experience of the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team in Daming County, Hebei Province, proves that in the process of organizing labor mutual aid, it is necessary to strengthen farmers' education in collective labor and constantly correct the selfish concepts and conservative ideas of small farmers in order to consolidate and develop the mutual aid team.

    The Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team has a history of nearly six years. Last year, the total production of the team exceeded more than double the production before the War of Resistance. All thirty households in the team are living prosperously, and the team has a relatively sound system of work point calculation and labor discipline. Based on the above situation, the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team should be very solid, but the fact is not so. This developing mutual aid team saw six farmers withdraw from the team after last autumn.

    Why did they withdraw from the mutual aid team?

    First, let's look at the brothers Zhang Hongtu and Zhang Hongen. They used to be hired farmers, and only after the land reform did they have land and cattle. Both of them are old members of the Zhang Xishun team and work best in the team. Last year, when they saw the team using more than 50,000 jin of rice from sideline business surpluses to buy mules, rubber-tired carts, and oil mill furniture, and opening a warehouse, they muttered to themselves: "Transportation and warehouses are businesses we can't figure out. If something goes wrong, even the little life we've worked for half our lives will be lost." So, they took advantage of the team's year-end settlement after the autumn harvest to declare their withdrawal from the mutual aid team.

    Another one is Zhao Hongju. This person learned a set of beekeeping techniques in the team last year. When he had just mastered the technique, he began to make a small calculation in his mind: Moving three hives of bees for someone else earns one hive, worth 300 jin of wheat each. Moving a few hives each year is much better than hoeing the fields in the team! So he also withdrew from the mutual aid team.

    There were also Ren Haoxian, Zhang Ximing, and three others who felt that individual production was not difficult anymore. Either they claimed that their physical strength was strong and they should not be counted the same work points as the elderly, or they complained that the work others did for them was not good. They always felt that it was not worthwhile to be in the team, and they also withdrew from the mutual aid team one after another.

    At the end of last year, after Zhang Xishun returned from attending the Hebei Provincial Model Worker Representative Conference, he felt very sad when he saw the looseness of the team. Jia Wenxiang, the secretary of the CCP village branch, and others helped him research it several times and found that there were some problems within the team. The team's work point calculation system was not completely in line with the principle of equivalent exchange, and the lack of regular ideological education allowed some team members' scattered and backward ideas to develop. After the inspection, the mutual aid team decided to start rectifying from solving practical problems and strengthening the ideological education of team members. Zhang Xishun first took various measures to strengthen the collective education of the team members, explaining the prospects of organizing and the benefits to everyone, and inspiring the team members' enthusiasm for mutual aid. For example, this spring the team raised more than 100 Leghorn chickens. Zhang Xishun said to the team members: "Who in our village can raise hundreds of chickens? Isn't it because we established a mutual aid team?" During the spring plowing, the team tried using new-style walking plows, plowing deeply and widely, and the team members were very happy. Zhang Xishun also said to the team members: "Because we are organized, we can use this plow. One animal cannot pull this plow." This spring, the mutual aid team's transportation production profit was more than eight million yuan. Some team members engaged in transportation felt that they had made contributions and should be rewarded. Zhang Xishun said to them: "You made money when you went out for transportation, but your land was also well planted. Look how well our crops are growing." Zhang Xishun often instilled collectivist ideas into the team members with these concrete examples. Secondly, Zhang Xishun strengthened the leadership of the team and revised the work point calculation system. After the rectification, the production enthusiasm of all team members soared. This spring, all the team members used the drought-resistant planting method to sow 60 mu of cotton fields, exceeding the original plan by more than 10 mu.

    Zhang Hongtu, Zhang Hongen, Zhao Hongju, and others, since withdrawing from the mutual aid team, always felt that their work was not energetic, and when they encountered difficulties in production technology, no one helped them. Therefore, they constantly thought of the benefits of the mutual aid team, and heard that the team was getting better and better, and also used the surplus from sideline businesses to buy a large amount of soybean cake. They regretted their momentary confusion. In this way, they asked Zhang Xishun to return to the mutual aid team. Zhang Xishun took the opportunity to educate them that they should look further ahead and should link their own interests with the interests of everyone, and not just take care of themselves. After they made self-criticisms, they joined the mutual aid team again.

    The team members who rejoined the team felt that the mutual aid team was particularly warm and lovely, and their enthusiasm for labor was significantly improved. Originally, two people took care of one cart during transportation production, but now Zhang Hongtu proposed to take care of one cart alone. Ren Haoxian, who had always been lazy, took the lead in everything and picked up heavy work after returning to the mutual aid team. From then on, everyone in the team was very united, as close as a family. They said: "The team is a big family, and our own home is a small family. We discuss and solve problems together, and we can no longer withdraw from the team and break up just for a small matter!"

    Zhang Xishun accepted this experience and lesson, and paid more attention to strengthening the ideological education of the mutual aid team members. This spring, when launching the patriotic production increase competition, the team discussed and formulated an inspection system and a criticism system, and stipulated the methods for team members to conduct political and cultural studies. In the patriotic production increase movement, the team has been further developed and consolidated.

    要不断纠正小农的自私观念和保守思想
    ——张希顺互助组发展中的一段波折
    新华社记者  冯建伟
    河北省大名县张希顺互助组的经验证明：在组织劳动互助的过程中，必须对农民加强集体劳动的教育，不断纠正小农的自私观念和保守思想，才能使互助组巩固和发展。
    张希顺互助组有近六年的历史了，去年全组生产量已经超过抗战前生产量的一倍以上。全组三十户，家家生活富裕，组里有比较健全的计工换工制度和劳动纪律。根据上述情况，张希顺互助组应该是十分巩固的，但事实并不是这样，这个正在发展中的互助组，去年秋后就有六户农民退出互助组。
    他们为什么退出互助组呢？
    首先来看张洪图、张洪恩弟兄俩。他俩原先是雇农，土地改革后，才有了土地和耕牛。他俩都是张希顺组的老组员，在组里劳动最好。去年他俩看到组里用副业盈余五万多斤米，买了骡马、胶轮车和油坊家具，并开设了一座货栈，心里就嘀咕着：“运输和货栈，都是咱捉摸不透的买卖，万一有了闪失，连咱半辈子生产来的小日子都得赔进去。”于是，他们便趁秋后全组结帐时，声明退出互助组。
    另一个是赵洪聚，这人去年在组里学会了一套养蜜蜂的技术，当他刚刚掌握了技术后，心里就打起小算盘来：给人移三窝蜂赚一窝，每窝值三百斤麦子，每年移它几窝，可比在组里锄地强多了！这样他也就退出互助组。
    还有任好贤、张希明等三人，觉着个人生产困难不大了，不是藉口自己体力强不该与年老的一样计工，就是嫌别人给自己干的活不好，总是觉得在组里不合算，也先后退出互助组。
    去年年底，张希顺参加了河北省劳动模范代表大会回来后，看到组里的松散劲儿，心里十分难过。中共村支部书记贾文祥等帮助他研究了几次，发现组内存在着一些问题。组里的计工制度不完全合于等价交换的原则，又因缺少经常的思想教育，致使有些组员散漫落后的思想得以发展。检查后，互助组决定从解决实际问题与加强对组员的思想教育两方面着手整顿。张希顺首先采取各种办法加强对组员的集体主义教育，说明组织起来的前途与对每个人的好处，启发组员互助热情。例如，今春该组饲养了一百多只莱克亨鸡，张希顺就对组员说：“咱村谁能养起百只鸡？还不是因为咱们成立互助组吗？”春耕时，该组试用新式步犁犁地，犁得又深又宽，组员都很高兴。张希顺又对组员说：“因为咱们组织起来才能用这犁，一个牲口是不能拉这犁的。”今年春天，互助组的运输生产盈利八百多万元，有些搞运输的组员觉着自己有了功该受奖励。张希顺就对他们说：“你出外运输是赚了钱，可是你的地也种好了，你看咱们的庄稼长的多好。”张希顺就用这些具体的事例，经常给组员灌输集体主义的思想。其次，张希顺又加强了对小组的领导，修订了计工制度。整顿后，全体组员的生产热情空前高涨。今年春季，全组组员用抗旱点种的方法，播种棉田六十亩，超过原计划十余亩。
    张洪图、张洪恩、赵洪聚等自从退出互助组后，干活总觉得不赶劲，生产技术上有了困难，也没有人帮助他们。因此，他们就不断想起互助组的好处，又听说组里越干越好，还用做副业盈余买了大批豆饼，就后悔自己的一时糊涂。这样，他们便向张希顺要求回到互助组里来。张希顺趁机教育他们应该看远点，应该把自己利益和大伙利益联在一起，不能光顾自己。他们作了检讨后，又参加了互助组。
    重回了组的组员，感觉互助组格外温暖可爱，劳动热情显著提高。原来进行运输生产时，两人照顾一辆车，现在张洪图提出自己单独照顾一辆。一贯懒惰的任好贤，回到互助组里来后处处干在头里，并且捡重活干。从此以后，全组的人都很团结，亲如一家人，他们说：“组里是个大家庭，自己家是个小家庭，有事就商量着解决，再不能为一点小事就退组散伙了！”
    张希顺接受了这一次的经验教训，更注意了加强对互助组组员的思想教育。今春开展爱国丰产竞赛时，该组又经讨论制订了检查制度和开展批评的制度，规定了组员进行政治文化学习的办法。在爱国丰产运动中，该组又得到进一步的发展与巩固。
