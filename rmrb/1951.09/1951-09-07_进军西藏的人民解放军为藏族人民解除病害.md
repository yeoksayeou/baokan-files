The People's Liberation Army Marching into Tibet Eliminates Diseases for the Tibetan People

    In the past, under the evil rule of imperialist aggressors and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Tibetan people lived in extreme poverty and suffering. Scientific culture was backward. When they got sick, they only knew to pray to gods, and there was no medical treatment to speak of. Common diseases among them, such as rheumatism, venereal diseases, pneumonia, smallpox, and gastrointestinal diseases, could not be effectively treated. As a result, the fertility rate of the Tibetan people was declining, and the mortality rate—especially the infant mortality rate—was very high. However, since the People's Liberation Army marched into the Kangzang Plateau, this situation has begun to improve.

    The People's Liberation Army marching into Tibet regarded "treating the Tibetan people for illnesses free of charge" as an important political task for the medical staff, all commanders, and fighters. Even in the case of lack of medicine, they did not relax this work.

    At first, the Tibetan people did not believe in foreign medicine. However, after the patient treatment by the medical staff of the People's Liberation Army and the advocacy of some progressive Tibetans, "go to the People's Liberation Army for treatment when you are sick" became a habit for the Tibetan people. The clinics set up in Qamdo, Lhorong Dzong, Ningjing and other places were often crowded with Tibetan people and lamas seeking medical treatment. After the clinic of the Qamdo District People's Liberation Committee was established in November last year, there were 43 Tibetans who came to see a doctor in the first month, which increased to 130 in the second month, and further increased to 424 in early March this year. According to incomplete statistics from the health department of the troops marching into Tibet, more than 10,000 Tibetan people have received free treatment, of which lamas accounted for 15 percent, including Living Buddhas of great fame in Qamdo, Chaya, Jiangda, and Zhujing and other places.

    In addition to setting up clinics for the Tibetan people with day and night shifts, the medical staff of the People's Liberation Army also went to remote places to diagnose and treat diseases for the Tibetan people. In Batang and Ningjing, the medical staff of the clinics treated more than 1,100 patients in four months, traveling almost all over the entire southern Kang region. The doctors at the Ningjing clinic traveled nearly a hundred miles to treat the Tibetan people. In Qamdo, the garrison also assisted the People's Liberation Committee in eliminating the smallpox disaster that had plagued the Tibetan people for many years, taking advantage of various opportunities to publicize free vaccination to the Tibetan people, and many Tibetan children were vaccinated as a result.

    After the news that the People's Liberation Army treated the Tibetan people spread, many Tibetans came from hundreds of miles away for treatment and led good horses to greet the doctors of the People's Liberation Army. The Tibetan people everywhere were proclaiming: "The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army truly love the Tibetan people. Our lives are not only getting better, but our lives are also guaranteed." Many cured Tibetan patients and their families sent beef legs, ghee and other gifts to the People's Liberation Army, but they were politely declined. The Tibetan people used the title of "Living Buddha who can cure diseases" to thank the People's Liberation Army.

    Now, the People's Government and the garrison are planning to carry out large-scale health work. In the future, the Tibetan people will gradually get rid of the pain of illness in the big family of the People's Republic of China with the assistance of the People's Government and the garrison.

### 进军西藏的人民解放军为藏族人民解除病害

    进军西藏的人民解放军为藏族人民解除病害
    过去在帝国主义侵略势力和国民党反动派的罪恶统治下，藏族人民生活非常贫困和痛苦，科学文化落后，有了病只知道求神，根本谈不上什么医药治疗。在他们中间普遍流行的风湿、花柳、肺炎、天花和肠胃病等，都得不到有效的治疗。由于这个原因，藏民的生殖率日益减低，死亡率——特别是婴儿死亡率很大。可是，自从人民解放军进军康藏高原以后，这种情况，就有了初步的改善了。
    进军西藏的人民解放军，把“义务为藏族人民治病”作为部队医务工作人员与全体指挥员和战斗员的一项重要政治任务，即使在医药缺乏的情况下，也没有放松这一项工作。
    开始的时候，藏族人民对外来的医药是不相信的。但是，经过人民解放军医务人员对病人的耐心医治和一部分进步的藏族人士的倡导，“有病找解放军去治”就成为藏族人民的习惯了。设立在昌都、洛隆宗、宁静等地的门诊所前，常常挤满了要求治病的藏族人民和喇嘛。昌都地区人民解放委员会的门诊所在去年十一月设立以后，第一个月来治病的藏民有四十三名，第二个月就增加到一百三十名，今年三月初更增加到四百二十四名。据进军西藏部队卫生部门的不完全统计，已经有一万多个藏族人民受到义务的治疗，其中喇嘛就占到百分之十五，包括昌都、察雅、江达和竹菁等地负有盛名的活佛。
    人民解放军的医务人员，除了为藏族设立昼夜值班的门诊所以外，而且还跑到很远的地方去给藏民诊治疾病。在巴塘和宁静两地，诊疗所的部队医务人员，在四个月中出诊治疗了一千一百多名病人，几乎走遍了整个康南地区。宁静诊疗所的医生跑到近百里外的地方去为藏族人民治病。在昌都，驻军更协助人民解放委员会解除为害藏族人民多年的天花灾害，在藏族人民中利用各种机会宣传义务为藏族人民施种牛痘，许多藏族儿童因此都种了牛痘。
    人民解放军为藏族人民治病的事情传开以后，许多藏民从数百里外赶来治病，并牵着好马来迎接人民解放军医生。藏族人民到处宣传着：“共产党、解放军真正爱护藏族人民，我们的生活不但好起来了，而且生命也有保障了。”许多被医治好的藏族病人和他们的家属把牛腿、酥油等作为礼物送给人民解放军，但是都被婉言谢绝了。藏族人民用“能治病的活菩萨”的称呼来感谢人民解放军。
    现在，人民政府及驻军正有计划地大规模地展开卫生工作，今后藏族人民将在中华人民共和国的大家庭中，在人民政府及驻军的协助下逐步摆脱疾病的痛苦。
