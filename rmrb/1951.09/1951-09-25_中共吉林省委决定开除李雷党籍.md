    The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to expel Li Lei from the Party. Li Lei, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Jilin Provincial People's Government and concurrently Principal of Changchun Senior High School and a Communist Party member, abused his position to insult female students and adopted deceptive and concealing measures towards the Party, persisting in his errors.

    After Li Lei arrived at Changchun High School in the autumn of 1949, he disregarded the Party's influence and the state's laws, and often used excuses such as discussing work, talking about history, introducing Party membership, reciting poetry, and teaching dance, to use extremely vile methods to harass and insult female students and female staff, causing most of the female students to be unable to concentrate on their studies, and some of those who were insulted even contemplated suicide. Not only did Li Lei not repent for this obvious criminal behavior, but he also said that he felt "empty and lonely" without women, and felt "the vast world is a dark night." This fully proves that his thinking is extremely corrupt.

    Li Lei was not only so corrupt and degenerate, but also wantonly bragged and attacked others in his work. On the one hand, he boasted that the achievements of Changchun High School were inseparable from him, and on the other hand, he slandered others as "old dogmatists" and "dog urine moss growing in the golden palace." In reality, he hardly ever left his room, rarely inspected and studied work, and relied solely on a few people to report to him. Teachers said that his approach was "the tiger does not leave its cave," but he claimed that this was a "unique" leadership method. In addition, he boasted about his "greatness" in front of teachers and students, deceiving young people, causing students in the school to write such sentences in letters to Soviet youth: "We are students of the great Chinese poet Li Lei." In letters between classmates, some people also wrote "We are students of the wise and great Li Lei."

    In order to cover up his mistakes and suppress democracy, Li Lei conducted so-called "education to protect the leaders and not talk carelessly to the outside world" at Changchun High School in the name of "protecting the school." When his mistakes were reported by others, he not only adopted a dishonest attitude towards the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, minimizing his mistakes and concealing them as much as possible, but also threatened and co-opted people in the school, attempting to cover up his mistakes. He wooed Zou Naifeng, a teacher and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch at Changchun High School, saying: "I have a comrade-brother relationship with you. I have raised your salary to 280 points. Things in the school cannot be talked about carelessly. The reason we are where we are today is because we fought with the city." He threatened some female students, saying: "If you talk about relationships between men and women, it's nothing for the man, but it's a big deal for the woman, especially if they are not married."

    The mistakes committed by Li Lei seriously damaged the prestige of the Party, but he believed that this was merely a matter of "having love relationships with a few female students," a problem of lifestyle. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline and educate all Party members, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to expel Li Lei from the Party. This decision has been approved by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. His administrative position has also been revoked by the People's Government.

    中共吉林省委决定开除李雷党籍
    吉林省人民政府文教厅副厅长兼长春市高级中学校长、共产党员李雷，利用职位，污辱女生，并对党采取欺骗隐瞒手段，坚持错误，已被中共吉林省委员会开除党籍。
    李雷于一九四九年秋到长春高中后，即不顾党的影响与国家的法纪，常以谈工作、谈历史、介绍入党、念诗、教跳舞等为藉口，用极卑鄙的手段，调戏与污辱女生和女职员，致使大部分女生不能安心学习，个别被污辱的还曾想自杀。对于这种明显的犯罪行为，李雷不仅不知改悔，反而说离开女人就感到“空虚和寂寞”，感到“茫茫世界夜沉沉”。足证其思想腐烂已极。
    李雷不仅如此腐化堕落，而且在工作中肆意吹骗，打击别人。他一面吹嘘长春高中的工作成绩与他分不开，一面诬蔑别人为“老教条”、“狗尿苔长在金銮殿”。实际上他却是成天不出屋子，很少检查与研究工作，而专靠几个人给他汇报。教员说他这种作法是“老虎不出洞”，他却自称这是“独特”的领导方法。此外，他并在师生面前吹嘘自己“伟大”，蒙蔽青年，致使该校学生在写给苏联青年的信中，出现了这样的句子：“我们是伟大的中国诗人李雷的学生。”同学之间写信，也有人写“我们是英明的伟大的李雷的学生”。
    为了掩饰错误，压制民主，李雷以“爱护学校”为名，在长春高中进行了所谓“爱护首长，不能随便向外乱讲”的“教育”。及至他的错误被别人告发，他还一面对中共长春市委采取不老实态度，对其错误避重就轻，尽量隐瞒；一面在学校里进行威胁、拉拢，企图掩饰其错误。他拉拢长春高中教员兼团总支书记邹乃锋说：“我对你是同志兄弟关系，我曾把你的工薪提到二百八十分。学校里的事不能乱讲。我们所以有今天，都是和市里斗争得来的。”他威胁某些女生说：“男女关系讲出去，男的没啥，女的事就大了，特别是没结婚的。”
    李雷所犯的错误，严重地损害了党的威信，但他却认为这仅是“和几个女生有了恋爱关系”的生活作风问题。为了严肃执行党的纪律，教育全体党员，中共吉林省委员会决定开除李雷的党籍。此决定业经中共中央东北局纪律检查委员会批准。其行政职务亦已被人民政府撤销。
