    Truman's Lengthy Speech at the San Francisco Conference
    Exposes US Conspiracy to Conclude Separate Peace with Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, September 6th dispatch from San Francisco] US President Truman delivered a lengthy speech at the opening of the San Francisco Conference on the 4th, regarding the Japanese peace treaty. Although Truman's speech was filled with falsehoods and empty rhetoric, it could not conceal the US plot to rearm Japan and turn it into the main tool of US aggression in the Far East.

    Truman, as usual, hypocritically spouted a set of false words about peace and democracy, saying that the separate peace treaty with Japan, which was actually a war treaty that the United States wanted to sign at the San Francisco Conference, was to establish a so-called "world of peaceful coexistence." Truman shamelessly described the various crimes committed by the United States during its six years of rule over Japan, such as destroying democracy and restoring militarism, as the US having carried out many "reforms" in Japan, and that "the Japanese people have been developing a stable economy and a democratic society." Truman then revealed that the reason why the United States wanted to conclude a separate peace treaty was to "create conditions" for the United States to "further" rule Japan. And "one of the primary concerns" of the United States when drafting the Japanese peace treaty was how to make Japan an accomplice in American aggression under the guise of a fictitious so-called "not being subjected to aggression" and "security." Truman said: "To achieve this," it is important for Japan to abide by the so-called "United Nations principles and be protected by the common obligations of the United Nations member states." However, given that "the approval of Japan as a member of the (United Nations) may be delayed," the United States could not wait to "stipulate in the US-made treaty that the Japanese people should immediately accept the basic obligations of a member of the United Nations" to support the United Nations' so-called "efforts to maintain peace." Truman also admitted: "In a sense, these provisions are the heart of the treaty." The US's main purpose in concluding a separate peace with Japan is to rearm Japan and use the United Nations as a pretext to drive Japan to act as a tool of US aggression, which is clearly exposed here once again.

    Truman also revealed in his speech the US attempt to establish an aggressive bloc centered on Japan in the Pacific. He further stated that the "US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty" signed on August 30 and the "Australia, New Zealand, and US Security Treaty" signed on September 1 were "some preliminary steps" in this plan of the United States. And "it is important to have Japan join these special security agreements for maintaining (should be read as destroying) peace in the Pacific as quickly as possible." Truman confessed that according to the US plan, the "evolution" of the Pacific aggressive bloc will be that "the Japanese defense forces that may be established will be united with the defense forces of other countries in the Pacific region." But everyone knows that the so-called "defense" in Truman's mouth has proven to be just a synonym for "aggression."

    Truman also mentioned the "US-Japan military agreement" that is being prepared for signing. He openly said: "Under such a treaty, the United States will temporarily (!) maintain armed forces in Japan." In this way, it is completely clear that after the US-British bloc concludes a separate peace with Japan, Japan will still be a colony under US military occupation.

    Although Truman decorated this speech with many words such as "peace," "security," and "defense," he was not able to conceal the strong aggressive nature and the smell of gunpowder in the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan.

### 杜鲁门在旧金山会议的冗长演说  暴露美国单独对日媾和阴谋

    杜鲁门在旧金山会议的冗长演说
    暴露美国单独对日媾和阴谋
    【新华社六日讯】旧金山消息：美国总统杜鲁门在四日旧金山会议开幕时，发表了一篇关于对日和约的冗长的演说。杜鲁门在演说中虽然颠倒黑白，空话连篇，但仍然掩盖不了美国重新武装日本并使之成为美国在远东的主要侵略工具的阴谋。
    杜鲁门照例虚伪地说了一套和平和民主的假话，说什么美国要在旧金山会议上签订的实际上是战争条约的单独对日和约，是为了建立一个所谓“和平相处的世界”。杜鲁门把美国统治日本六年以来所作的摧残民主和恢复军国主义的种种罪恶，厚颜无耻地说成是美国在日本进行了许多“改革”，“日本人民一直在发展稳定的经济和民主的社会”。杜鲁门接着透露，美国所以要缔结单独和约，就是为了替美国“进一步”统治日本“创立条件”。而美国拟订对日和约时，“首先关心的问题之一”就是如何在虚构的所谓“不致遭受侵略”和“安全”的外衣下，使日本充当美国的侵略帮凶。杜鲁门说：“为了实现这一点”，使日本遵守所谓“联合国原则并受到联合国会员国共同义务的保护，是重要的”。但是美国鉴于“日本被批准为（联合国）会员国还可能会有迟延”，所以就迫不及待地在美制和约上“规定日本人民应立刻接受联合国会员国的基本义务”，以支持联合国所谓“维持和平的努力”。杜鲁门并承认：“在某种意义上说来，这些条款实是和约的心脏”。美国单独对日媾和的主要目的在于重新武装日本并假借联合国的名义驱使日本充当美国侵略工具的阴谋，在这里是又一次明显地暴露出来了。
    杜鲁门在演说中还暴露了美国企图在太平洋建立以日本为中心的侵略集团。他进一步说：美国的“需要还不止于此”。他指出：八月三十日签订的“美菲联防条约”和九月一日签订的“澳、新、美三国安全条约”，就是美国这一计划的“几个初步的步骤”。而“尽可能迅速地使日本加入这些保持（应读作破坏）太平洋和平的专门的安全协定，是很重要的。”杜鲁门供认：根据美国的计划，太平洋侵略集团的“演变”，将是“可能会建立的日本防御力量将与太平洋地区其他国家的防御力量联合在一起”。但是尽人皆知：杜鲁门口中的所谓“防御”，事实证明只是“侵略”的代名词。
    杜鲁门也提到准备签订的“美日军事协定”。他公开说：“按照这样的条约，美国将在日本暂时（！）保持武装部队。”这样，在美英集团单独对日媾和后，日本将仍然是美军占领下的殖民地，也就完全明白了。
    尽管杜鲁门用许多“和平”、“安全”、“防御”之类的词藻装饰起来的这篇演说，却丝毫没有能够掩盖住美英对日和约草案的浓厚的侵略性与火药味。
