Purely Technical Viewpoint Is the Root Cause of Our Technical Personnel's Problems
Chen Zhongying, Chief Technician of Shanxi Construction Company

I am engaged in engineering design work and specialized in technology before liberation. However, since participating in the work of the people's enterprises, my technology has not been well utilized; moreover, several mistakes have occurred in my work, causing waste. This situation made me feel distressed. Was the error caused by a bad environment? It cannot be said that at all. Because many facts tell me that the People's Government attaches great importance to technical personnel. Taking myself as an example, my life is much better than before liberation, and the leading comrades of the enterprise are so enthusiastic and caring for me. The People's Government has stipulated regulations on rewarding inventions and creations in order to encourage the improvement and advancement of technology. So where is the problem? This confused concept was only initially resolved at the technical meeting held by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Industry Department in mid-August this year.

At the meeting, several responsible comrades told us: "If any undertaking is divorced from politics, it will not have a correct direction and will become useless." "A purely technical viewpoint is wrong." These words guided me into a fierce ideological struggle. After a period of historical recollection, and after listening to the speeches of other comrades at the group meeting, and examining my own work, my thinking began to clear up. I realized that a purely technical viewpoint is my own root cause of my problems. Not studying politics and not establishing the viewpoint of serving the people is the root cause of errors in my work. Last year, a certain agency was building houses. During the design, I knew that groundwater would inevitably be encountered during construction, and water absorption equipment would be required. I also suggested purchasing a water pump. However, because of the mercenary mentality, when other comrades suggested that water pumps could be rented from the Water Conservancy Bureau, I abandoned my original opinion without any consideration. I mistakenly thought: "This is an economic problem, not a technical problem. Even if there is a loss, it won't be my loss." As a result, the rented water pump was not suitable for the job, which affected the construction progress. And the rental fee for the water pump alone cost more than 100,000 jin of millet, enough to buy several water pumps. This is the evil consequence of a purely technical viewpoint.

If one's position and viewpoint are not clear, there is naturally no question of relying on workers and taking the mass line. When designing a dormitory for a training class, I myself did not understand the situation, nor did I humbly learn from the masses. I subjectively used fir wood for the house frame according to the customs of the South, and designed them all in the Western style. During construction, the workers had many opinions. Everyone's opinion was that the workers were not skilled in making Western-style house frames, and there was no need to use Western-style house frames for this dormitory. However, I did not consider these correct opinions of everyone. As a result, the workers made all the joints of the Western-style house frame into the appearance of Chinese-style house frames, losing the function of Western-style house frames. The Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau also did not approve the project I designed. The reason was: in addition to the workers' lack of technical conditions, it was also not suitable to use fir wood for the house frame in Taiyuan. As a result, the project was completely changed, and the materials and styles were all changed, causing serious losses. If I could have humbly considered and accepted the workers' opinions, this loss could have been completely avoided.

The problem of not believing in the masses and not taking the mass line also exists in the relationship with technical personnel. The wrong idea of individual heroism exists in my mind. My attitude towards other comrades is: "You look down on me, why should I ask you for advice!" As a result, the technical personnel of the company are not united. This made me lose my responsibility as a chief technician.

The historical roots of this purely technical viewpoint are very deep. Before the liberation of Shanghai, my source of livelihood came from my family of landlords and capitalists on the one hand, and from technology on the other. This cultivated my strong liberal ideas and purely technical viewpoint. After liberation, under the inspiration of many facts, some changes had taken place in my thinking. However, the purely technical viewpoint still occupies a dominant position in my mind. I always thought: "As long as I have technology, that's enough." So I didn't study politics. In this way, I could not realize how important my responsibility for national construction was, and I could not see my bright future, but narrowed my vision to a small circle of being responsible only for my own technology. That is to say, what I often considered was not how to serve the people, but how to maintain my so-called "technical authority." A responsible comrade at the meeting pointed out: "Our country needs a large number of technical personnel to build industrialization." This clearly tells us that the worry about unemployment for technical personnel in the new China is completely superfluous.

After this meeting and inspection of work, I have initially realized that only by improving my political consciousness and establishing the viewpoint of serving the people can technology play a role. The idea of neglecting politics is wrong. In the future, I am determined to strengthen political study, study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Combine technology and politics, establish the idea of being the master of our own affairs, and do a good job in the basic construction of our country.

### 单纯技术观点是我们技术人员的病根

    单纯技术观点是我们技术人员的病根
    山西建筑公司主任技师  陈仲瑛
    我是做工程设计工作的，在解放前曾专门学技术。但是，从参加了人民企业工作以来，我的技术并没有很好的发挥作用；而且在工作中还发生了几次错误，造成浪费。这种情况，使我感到苦恼。错误是环境不好造成的吗？完全不能这样讲。因为有许多事实都告诉我：人民政府对技术人员是十分重视的。就以我自己来说，生活比解放前好得多了，企业的领导同志对我又是那样的热情和关怀。人民政府为了奖励提高和改进技术，规定了奖励发明创造的条例。那末问题在那里呢？这个糊涂观念，在今年八月中旬山西省人民政府工业厅召开的技术会议上，才初步得到解决。
    会议上几位负责同志告诉我们：“任何事业，如果脱离了政治，它就不会有正确的方向，就会成为没用的东西。”“单纯的技术观点是错误的。”这些话引导我进行了激烈的思想斗争。经过一段历史回忆，又在小组会上听了其他同志的发言，并把自己的工作做了检查，我的思想开始清醒起来。我认识到，单纯的技术观点，这就是自己的病根。自己不学政治，没有树立起为人民服务的观点，这就是在工作中发生错误的根本原因。去年某机关建筑房屋。在设计时，我知道施工中必然要碰到地下水层，需要有吸水设备。我也曾提议购买吸水机。但因雇佣观点作怪，所以当其他同志提出吸水机可以到水利局去租用时，我就丝毫不加考虑地放弃了原来的意见。我错误地认为：“这是经济问题，不是技术问题。就是损失，也损失不了我的。”结果因租用的吸水机性能不合，影响了施工进度。并且只是吸水机的租费，就用了十几万斤小米，足够买几部吸水机用。这就是单纯技术观点所造成的恶果。
    自己的立场、观点不明确，自然谈不到依靠工人，走群众路线的问题。给某训练班设计宿舍时，我自己不了解情况，又不虚心向群众学习，主观地按南方习惯用杉木做房架，并且都设计成西式样子。施工时，工友们意见很多。大家的意见是工人做西式房架的技术不熟练，并且这个宿舍也没有用西式房架的必要。但我对大家这些正确意见并没有加以考虑。结果工友们把西式房架的各个结合点，都给做成了中式房架的样子，失去了西式房架的作用。太原市人民政府建设局对我设计的这个工程也未予批准。原因是：除了工人的技术条件不具备外，用杉木做房架在太原也是不适合的。结果工程完全变更，材料和样式都改变了，造成严重的损失。如果我能虚心地考虑和接受工人们的意见，这项损失是完全可以避免的。
    不相信群众，不走群众路线的毛病，在和技术人员的关系上也存在着。自己脑子里存在着个人英雄主义的错误思想。对其他同志的态度是：“你看不起我，我何必请教你！”因此，就造成公司技术人员的互不团结。这就失去了我作为一个主任技师的责任。
    这种单纯技术观点产生的历史根源是很深的。上海解放前，我的生活来源，一方面是地主兼资本家的家庭；另一方面是凭技术。这就养成了我浓厚的自由主义思想，和单纯的技术观点。解放后在许多事实的启发下，我的思想曾发生了一些变化。但是，单纯的技术观点，在脑子里仍然占着统治地位。我总认为：“只要有技术就行。”所以就不学政治。这样，就使我认识不到自己对国家建设所担负的责任是如何重大，看不见自己的光明前途，而把眼光缩小到仅仅是为自己的技术负责的小圈子里。就是说，自己经常考虑的不是如何为人民服务的问题，而是怎样保持自己的所谓“技术的权威”的问题。会议上一位负责同志曾这样指出：“我们的国家，要建设成工业化，是需要大批的技术工作人员的。”这就明白地告诉我们：在新中国，技术人员怕失业的顾虑完全是多余的。
    经过这次会议和检查工作，使我初步认识到：只有提高自己的政治觉悟，确立了为人民服务的观点，技术才能够发挥作用。忽视政治的思想是错误的。今后我决心要加强政治学习，学习马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。把技术和政治结合起来，树立起主人翁思想，作好我们国家的基本建设工作。
