On the Issue of Remedial Democratic Reform in Factories and Mines (Part 1)
　　Liu Zijiu
Why do we need to implement remedial democratic reform in factories and mines?

Judging from the situations of state-owned and private enterprises in Wuhan, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Taiyuan, and other places, as well as the experiences and gains of carrying out democratic reform, this lesson of democratic reform transforms state-owned enterprises of a bureaucratic capitalist nature into enterprises of a socialist nature; in private enterprises, it transforms old democratic enterprises into new democratic enterprises. This is an indispensable stage or step in this historical development process, and it is a prerequisite for us to smoothly carry out the establishment of Party organizations, Communist Youth League organizations, trade union organizations, the development of patriotic labor competitions, and various other political, economic, and cultural construction work in factories and mines. Because imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism relied on a reactionary social force in addition to their reactionary political power (such as reactionary armies, military police, police, courts, prisons, etc.) to rule and manage the broad masses of workers and staff in factories and mines. In factories and mines, this reactionary social force is called "Tou Lao" in Wuhan, "Na Mo Wen" in Shanghai, and "Ba Tou" in Qingdao. Although the names are different, the essence is the same. These "Tou Lao," "Na Mo Wen," or "Ba Tou" are often also the organizers, heads, and backbones of reactionary organizations such as reactionary party and league secret service organizations (Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, Military Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, etc.), reactionary secret societies (Yiguandao, Jiugongdao, Ganzhurwad, etc.), feudal gangs (Qingbang, Hongbang, etc.), and puppet trade unions in factories and mines. During the reactionary rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang, the role of these feudal foremen in factories and mines was similar to that of the Bao and Jia chiefs in the countryside at that time. At the time of liberation, in order not to disrupt the original production structure and facilitate acceptance, we adopted a policy of taking over everything unchanged (this policy was completely correct and necessary at the time) with regard to these reactionary feudal social forces in factories and mines. In the two years since liberation, in individual places, factories and mines, and departments, we have used administrative power and methods from top to bottom to carry out some adjustments. However, generally speaking, the vast majority have not carried out systematic, organized, planned, and thorough reforms from the bottom up on the basis of letting go and mobilizing the masses, as is now being done in Wuhan, Qingdao, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan and other places.

After the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries in April and May of this year, most of the prominent and heinous counter-revolutionaries floating on the surface have been arrested or killed; however, most of the feudal foremen who have been riding on the heads of the working masses, acting like overlords, bullying others, extorting, and extorting money in the past and even now have remained untouched. These reactionary feudal foremen in factories and mines in various places constantly create political accidents, spread rumors, provoke disunity among workers, satirize and attack Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists, and some even pretend to be active and infiltrate our Party, Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations, becoming "Party members," "League members," and trade union "cadres," and some are even "elected as labor models"! The working masses call these feudal foremen "stones," "local emperors," "clouds covering the sun," "three opens" (meaning "successful" during the Kuomintang period, "successful" during the Japanese period, and still "successful" when the Communist Party came), and "three reds" (meaning "popular" during the Kuomintang and Japanese periods, and still "popular" when the Communist Party came). These feudal foremen are "stumbling blocks" to the deployment and implementation of various tasks by the Party, administration, trade unions, and Communist Youth League in our factories and mines. According to the summary report of Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, the main evil activities of these people can be summarized into the following seven points:

(1) Monitoring workers, colluding with military police outside the factory, and suppressing strikes (before liberation);

(2) Dismissing, fining, beating, and scolding workers, withholding wages, extorting, and accepting bribes;

(3) Bullying others, molesting female workers, raping female workers, occupying workers' wives and daughters, and forcing abortions;

(4) Under the instructions of secret agents, forming cliques with bad elements inside and outside the factory;

(5) Creating rumors, sabotage, and threatening workers;

(6) Sowing discord, spreading rumors, undermining unity, undermining production, and undermining work;

(7) Using their feudal relations and backward masses to attack activists and using the shortcomings in our work to incite the masses to strike and go slow.

After liberation, these reactionary feudal foremen could no longer extort money wantonly as in the past, and their past privileges of exploiting and oppressing the working masses have been greatly restricted; their activities have taken on legal and concealed forms. However, they have become accustomed to oppressing and despising the working masses. Precisely because of this, they are dissatisfied with the status quo and hold a hostile attitude towards the Communist Party and the People's Government.

The above is the actual situation that has long existed in factories and mines and has been exposed in this democratic reform process.

Since democratic reform in factories and mines is so necessary, why are we only proposing to implement remedial democratic reform today? Because a mass reform like democratic reform must have certain conditions, and today we have the conditions to implement democratic reform:

1. In the two years since liberation, the broad masses of workers have seen from the facts the continuous victories and correct measures of the Communist Party and the People's Government in military, political, economic, and cultural fields (among which the most influential on the working masses are price stability, labor insurance, and urban construction). The Communist Party and the People's Government have gained extremely high prestige among the broad masses of workers, and the broad masses of workers and staff believe that following the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government is never wrong.

2. After the liberation of various cities and mining areas, through various forms of publicity, education, and movements, such as studying the history of social development, promoting resistance to America and aid to Korea, vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries, launching patriotic labor competitions, and awarding labor models, the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly improved, and a group of activists who are politically active and work hard in production and study have emerged among the working masses, who can be used as the backbone for us to carry out this movement.

3. After more than two years of exploration and learning since liberation, our cadres in factories and mines (including the Party, administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League) have initially understood some production situations and learned some production knowledge, unlike in the early days of liberation when they were completely ignorant.

4. We have also grasped some materials and have some understanding of the enemy's situation.

5. After vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries and arresting or killing the heinous counter-revolutionaries who were oppressing the working masses, the broad masses of workers have been eager to try, proposing "to strike while the iron is hot and to thoroughly turn over." At the same time, those reactionary feudal foremen have also begun to panic, waver, and disintegrate.

6. After two years of work in factories and mines since liberation, we have initially established the organizations of the Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League.

The above are the conditions for us to propose democratic remedial lessons today.

The Requirements and Purposes of Democratic Reform

The requirements and purposes of democratic reform are to thoroughly reform the foreman system that imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism consciously established and cultivated in factories and mines and used to rule the working masses, based on the needs of production and the requirements of the masses, and using democratic methods, on the basis of organized and led efforts and letting go of mobilizing the masses. After removing the foreman system and saboteurs that hinder the unity and progress of the working masses, we will adopt sincere, honest, frank, self-criticism, and explanations of problems to resolve the various ideological burdens (such as forced membership in reactionary parties, leagues, and other reactionary organizations) and various disunity phenomena caused to the working masses under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, thereby enhancing the class consciousness of the working masses and strengthening the unity of the working class. Then, on the basis of the conscious and voluntary efforts of the working masses, we will establish a new labor attitude and establish various organizations and systems conducive to production construction and improvement of life, so as to create favorable conditions for smoothly launching patriotic labor competitions, implementing economic accounting systems, and welcoming large-scale production construction.

Policies, Steps, and Methods for Implementing Democratic Reform in Factories and Mines

1. According to Comrade Deng Zihui's report at the Urban Work Conference of the CPC Central Committee Central South Bureau, the policies of the democratic reform movement can be mainly summarized into the following four points: "Oppose feudalism but not capitalism (according to the state-owned enterprises should be both anti-feudal and anti-capital), oppose feudalism but not technology, fight the main but not the general, focus on economic liquidation, and deal with them separately."

2. The development process of the democratic reform movement, if the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not included, can be roughly divided into the following three steps according to the general development law:

The first step is democratic struggle. Using methods of recalling, comparing, and complaining about hardships, we will conduct reasoned struggles against those "foremen," "Tou Lao," "Na Mo Wen," heads of reactionary secret societies, heads of gangs, and backbone elements of reactionary parties and leagues, etc., who "do not ask about ability but ask about origin," do not participate in labor or do not participate much in labor, and carry out feudal oppression and exploitation on the heads of workers every day, at mass meetings (mostly workshop worker mass meetings, some also at full factory meetings or group meetings). Then, according to the size of their past crimes, production technology, labor attitude after liberation, and the degree of bowing their heads and admitting mistakes, they will be dealt with separately: demotion, salary reduction, transfer of work, mass control, suspension of trade union membership, and some with too many crimes and too much public resentment will be asked by the masses to be sent to the court for legal action or expulsion from the factory. This is the most important part of the democratic reform remedial lessons in terms of mobilizing the masses, and the working masses call this struggle a real "turn-over meeting," "liberation meeting," and "seeing the sun meeting." In this regard, the experiences of Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, Shenxin Cotton Mill, Jinan Chengda Cotton Mill, Shandong Paper Mill, and No. 4 Machine Factory are all good. The most important of these experiences is to explain the policies in detail, dispel concerns, support the masses, and let go of mobilizing the masses. Because at this time, the biggest concern of the working masses is that after they struggle against these "foremen" and raise opinions, the leadership will not support them, will not deal with them, and these "foremen" will cause trouble for them and "wear small shoes" for them afterward.

The second step is democratic unity. Using methods such as honesty, frankness, self-criticism, explaining problems, criticism, and self-criticism, remove the various ideological burdens of workers and staff (such as being forced to join reactionary parties, leagues, secret societies, gangs, puppet military police, etc.); eliminate the barriers between workers and workers, between staff and workers, between cadres and the masses (that is, between the Party, administration, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, mainly the leading cadres of the administration and trade unions and the working masses), between workers in this department and workers in that department, and between workers in this region and workers in that region, and strengthen the internal unity of the working class. In mobilizing the masses, this is a more detailed and wider-ranging stage. To do well in this aspect, the most important experience is: leading cadres, mainly leading cadres in the administrative and trade union aspects, should first conduct self-criticism and let the masses freely raise opinions on the leading cadres. Experience has proven that the result of letting the masses freely raise opinions is that workers rarely raise excessive demands, and most opinions are of great help to leading cadres.

The third step is democratic construction. On the basis of the enhanced awareness and strengthened unity of the broad masses of workers and staff, they will truly consciously and voluntarily carry out the construction of various organizations and systems that are conducive to production construction and improvement of life. In this regard, what has already been carried out in various places and has achieved remarkable results are: the responsibility system, contract system, and inspection system in production, the re-election of the trade union committee and the factory management committee, the registration or review of labor insurance cards, etc. As long as the first two stages are carried out thoroughly without deviations, this series of preliminary construction work can generally be completed within a month. In this regard, the most important experience is that after explaining the policies and methods, let the masses freely discuss from the bottom up and fully express their opinions, do not do everything on their behalf (not that leadership is not needed), and do not emphasize organizational guarantees. This time, many trade union grassroots organizations, after the re-election after democratic reform and democratic unity, did not implement any "organizational guarantees," but the results of the re-election were almost as expected by us, and some were even better. After the "stones were removed" by overthrowing those foremen and bad elements who even today are still riding on the heads of the working masses, the working masses' sense of responsibility as masters has been greatly enhanced; the working masses are very serious and responsible in dealing with various issues, and are not at all sloppy. When the workers of the Shandong Paper Mill in Jinan raised opinions to the leading cadres, they immediately protested when they found that individual cadres were drawing on paper and not listening and recording carefully: "Leading cadres should humbly listen to the opinions of the masses!" They are particularly serious about elections, and they seriously and repeatedly discuss and review the history, labor attitude, mass relations, position, and work style of each candidate. For example, when the trade union committee of Wuhan Shenxin Cotton Mill was re-elected, the leadership proposed 54 candidates, and after discussion and review by the masses, 10 were considered to have historical problems and were removed. The working masses are not only concerned about their own trade unions, but also very concerned about the development and consolidation of the Party. They have repeatedly raised opinions to the Party's leading organs about those Party members who have historical problems or have a bad work style and are divorced from the masses, believing that so-and-so cannot stay in the Party as a Party member and should be expelled from the Party. They also said: "In the past, leading cadres did not open their eyes and developed the Party casually, so that those bad elements could sneak into the Party organization. In the future, when developing new Party members, we should ask us and solicit our opinions." After the democratic reform, a large number of new activists enthusiastically requested to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. This shows that the democratic reform in factories and mines not only creates favorable conditions for launching patriotic labor competitions, implementing economic accounting systems, and welcoming great production construction work, but also removes obstacles and creates favorable conditions for us to rectify the Party, build the Party, and rectify the organizations of the Communist Youth League and build the work of the Communist Youth League in factories and mines.

    论厂矿企业中民主改革的补课问题（上）
    刘子久
    我们为什么要在厂矿企业中实行民主改革的补课呢？
    从武汉、青岛、郑州、济南、太原等地的国营、私营企业的情况及进行民主改革的经验与收获看来，民主改革这一课，在国营企业方面，是把官僚资本主义的企业，改变为社会主义性质的企业；在私营企业方面，是把旧民主主义的企业改变为新民主主义的企业。这一历史发展过程中一个不可缺少的阶段或步骤，是我们在工厂企业中，顺利地进行建立党的组织、团的组织、工会组织，开展爱国主义劳动竞赛以及其他各种政治、经济、文化等建设工作的先决条件。因为帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在工矿企业中对于广大工人职员群众的统治与管理，除了依靠他们的反动的政权力量（如反动的军队、宪兵、警察、法庭，监狱等）外，还要依靠一种反动社会力量。在工矿企业中，这种反动的社会力量，在武汉叫“头佬”、上海叫“纳摩温”、青岛叫做“把头”的一类人，名称虽不同，实质上是一样。这些“头佬”、“纳摩温”或“把头”往往同时就是反动党、团特务组织（中统、军统等）、反动会道门（一贯道、九宫道、甘珠尔瓦道等）。封建帮派（青帮、红帮等）与伪工会等反动组织，在工矿企业中的组织者、头子与骨干，他们往往一人身兼数职。在帝国主义和国民党的反动统治时代，这些封建把头在工矿企业中所起的作用，就像那个时候的保、甲长在农村中所起的作用类似。对于工矿企业中的这些反动的封建的社会力量，在解放的时候，为了不打乱原有的生产机构，便于接收，我们采用了原封不动一律包下来的政策（这种政策在当时是完全正确的必要的）。解放后两年以来，在个别地方、厂矿与部门中，我们曾经自上而下地运用行政的力量与方式进行过一些调整。但一般说来，绝大多数都未曾在放手发动群众的基础上，自下而上地进行过系统的、有组织、有计划、有步骤的、彻底的改革，像武汉、青岛、济南、郑州、太原等地现在所进行的那样。
    经过今年四、五月间大张旗鼓镇压反革命之后，那些浮在上面突出的罪大恶极的反革命分子，多半已被逮捕或杀掉；但是那些在过去直到现在仍然骑到工人群众的头上，作威作福，仗势欺人，敲诈勒索的封建把头，多半还依然未动。这些反动的封建把头在各地工矿企业中，不断地制造政治性的事故，散放谣言、挑拨工人之间的团结，讽刺与打击共产党员、青年团员与积极分子，有的还假装积极混入到我们的党、青年团与工会组织中来，当了“党员”“团员”与工会“干部”，有的甚至还被“选为劳动模范”！工人群众称这些封建把头为“石头”、“土皇上”、“遮盖太阳的云雾”、“三开”（即国民党时候“吃得开”，日本人时候“吃得开”，共产党来了还是“吃得开”）、“三红”（国民党、日本时候是“红人”，共产党来了还是“红人”）。这些封建把头是我们在工矿企业内党、行政、工会、青年团布置与进行各种工作的“绊脚石”。这些人的罪恶活动，根据武汉第一纱厂总结报告中所归纳的主要的有下列七条：
    （一）监视工人，勾结厂外军警，镇压罢工（解放前）；
    （二）开除、罚工、打骂工人、克扣工资、敲诈勒索、贪污受贿；
    （三）仗势欺人、调戏女工、强奸女工、霸占工人妻女、强迫打胎；
    （四）在特务分子指示下，结拜厂内外的坏分子；
    （五）造谣破坏，威胁工人；
    （六）挑拨离间、播弄是非、破坏团结、破坏生产、破坏工作；
    （七）利用他们的封建关系和落后群众，打击积极分子，利用我们工作中的缺点，煽动群众罢工、怠工。
    这些反动的封建把头，在解放之后，已不能像过去那样肆无忌惮地敲诈勒索，他们过去那些剥削和压迫工人群众的特权，已受到了很大的限制；他们的活动已采取了合法的隐蔽的形式。但他们欺压工人群众，看不起工人群众，已习惯成性。也正因为如此，他们对于现状是不满的，对共产党、人民政府是持敌视态度的。
    以上这些就是在工矿企业中长期存在而在这次民主改革过程中暴露出来的实际情况。
    工矿企业的民主改革既是如此必要，为什么我们今天才提出实行民主改革补课呢？因为像民主改革这样一种群众性的改革，必须具备一定的条件，今天我们已经具备了实行民主改革的条件：
    一、解放后两年来广大工人群众已从事实上看到了共产党、人民政府在军事、政治、经济、文化各方面的不断的胜利与正确的措施（其中对于工人群众影响最大的是物价稳定、劳动保险与市政建设等）。共产党、人民政府在广大的工人群众中已有了极高的威信，广大工人职员群众认为跟着共产党、毛主席、人民政府走就没有错。
    二、在各个城市及工矿区被解放后，经过了各种各样宣传教育与运动，如：学习社会发展史、宣传抗美援朝、大张旗鼓镇压反革命、开展爱国主义劳动竞赛、评奖劳动模范等，广大工人群众的政治觉悟已大大提高，在工人群众中已涌现出了一批在政治上积极、在生产与学习上努力的积极分子，可作为我们开展这一运动的骨干。
    三、经过解放后二年多的摸索与学习，我们在工矿企业中的干部（包括党、行政、工会、青年团在内）已初步地了解了一些生产情况，懂得了一些生产知识，不像在解放初期那样两眼漆黑了。
    四、对于敌人情况我们也掌握了一些材料，有了一些了解。
    五、经过大张旗鼓镇压反革命，把那些压在工人群众头上的罪大恶极的反革命分子加以逮捕或杀掉之后，广大工人群众已经跃跃欲试，提出“要趁热打铁，翻身要翻得彻底”。同时，那些反动封建把头也已开始恐慌、动摇、分化。
    六、在工矿企业中，经过解放后两年来的工作，我们已初步地建立了党、工会与青年团的组织。
    以上就是我们在今天提出民主补课的条件。
    民主改革的要求与目的
    民主改革的要求与目的，就是在有组织、有领导，放手发动群众的基础上，对于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在工矿企业中有意识地建立与培养并用以统治工人群众的把头制度，按照生产的需要与群众的要求，采用民主的方式，加以彻底的改革。在去掉阻碍工人群众团结进步的把头制度与破坏分子之后，对于过去在国民党反动统治之下，在工人群众身上所造成的各种思想包袱（如强迫加入反动党团及其他各种反动组织）与各种不团结的现象，采用忠诚老实、坦白、检讨、交代问题、批评与自我批评等方式加以解决，借以提高工人群众的阶级觉悟，加强工人阶级的团结，然后在工人群众自觉自愿的基础上，树立起新的劳动态度，建立各种有利于生产建设与生活改善的组织与制度，为顺利地开展爱国主义的劳动竞赛、实行经济核算制、迎接大规模的生产建设创造有利的条件。
    实行工矿企业民主改革的政策、步骤与办法
    一、民主改革运动的政策，根据邓子恢同志在中共中央中南局城市工作会议的报告中所指出的，主要的可以归结为下列四点：“反封建不反资本（按在国营企业中应当是既反封建又反资本），反封建不反技术，斗首要不斗一般，在经济上重点清算，分别处理。”
    二、民主改革运动的发展过程，如果不把大张旗鼓镇压反革命也算在内的话，按照一般的发展规律，大体上可分为下列三个步骤：
    第一步是民主斗争。采用回忆、对比诉苦的方式，对于那些“不问能力问来历”，不参加劳动或者不大参加劳动，天天骑在工人头上进行封建压迫、剥削的“把头”、“头佬”、“纳摩温”、反动会道门头子、帮派头子、反动党团的骨干分子等，在群众大会上（多半是车间工人群众大会，有的也在全厂大会或小组会议上），进行说理斗争。然后，按他们过去罪恶的大小、生产技术、解放后的劳动态度与低头认错的程度分别予以处理：降职、降薪、调动工作、群众管制、停止工会会籍，也有个别罪恶太多、民愤太大的，群众要求送法院法办或开除厂籍的。这是民主改革补课中，在发动群众问题上最重要的一段，工人群众把这种斗争会称为真正的“翻身会”、“解放会”、“见太阳会”。在这一方面，武汉的第一纱厂、申新纱厂、济南的成大纱厂、山东造纸厂与第四机器厂的经验都好。这些经验中最主要的一条就是详细地讲明政策，解除顾虑，为群众撑腰，放手发动群众。因为在这个时候工人群众最大的顾虑，就是怕他们对这些“把头”进行斗争、提了意见之后，领导方面不给他们撑腰作主，不加处理，事后这些“把头”找他们的麻烦，给他们“穿小鞋”。
    第二步是民主团结。采用忠诚老实、坦白、检讨、交代问题、批评与自我批评等方式，卸掉工人、职员在思想上的各种包袱（如被迫加入过反动党、团、会道门、帮派、伪军警等）；消除工人与工人之间、职员与工人之间、干部与群众之间（即党、行政、工会、青年团，主要是行政、工会的领导干部与工人群众之间），这部门工人与那部门工人之间，这地区工人与那地区的工人之间的隔阂，加强工人阶级的内部团结。在发动群众问题上，这是一个方式更细致，范围更广泛的阶段。在这一方面要作好，最主要的一条经验就是：领导干部，主要是行政方面与工会的领导干部，首先进行自我检讨，放手让群众对领导干部提意见。经验证明：放手让群众提意见的结果，工人很少提出过高的要求，大多数意见对领导干部的帮助很大。
    第三步是民主建设。广大工人、职员群众在提高了觉悟，加强了团结的基础上，真正自觉自愿地进行有利于生产建设与生活改善的各种组织与制度的建设工作。在这一方面，各地已经进行过而获有显著成绩的是：生产上的责任制、合同制、检查制，工会委员会与工厂管理委员会的改选，劳动保险卡片的登记或覆查等。只要前两阶段作得彻底，没有偏差，这一系列的初步的建设工作，一般的在一个月内就可以完成。在这一方面，最主要的一条经验就是在讲明政策、办法之后，放手让群众自下而上地讨论，充分地发表意见，不要包办代替（不是不要领导），不要强调组织保证。这次许多工会基层组织，经过民主改革、民主团结之后的改选，都没有实行什么“组织保证”，但改选结果都和我们所预期的差不多，有的甚至更好些。在反掉那些过去甚至今天仍然骑在工人群众头上的把头、坏蛋分子，“搬掉石头”后，工人群众的主人翁的责任感，大大地提高了；工人群众对于各种问题的处理都非常认真负责，一点也不马虎。济南山东造纸厂的工人给领导干部提意见，发现有个别干部在纸上画着玩，不好好地听与记录时，马上就提出抗议：“领导干部应当虚心听取群众的意见！”特别对于选举认真，对于每一个候选人的历史、劳动态度、群众关系、立场作风等都是认真地反覆地讨论、审查。如武汉申新纱厂的工会委员会改选时，领导方面提出了五十四名候选人，经过群众讨论审查之后，就有十名被认为历史上有问题而被抹掉了。工人群众不仅对于自己的工会关心，对于发展党、巩固党也都非常关心。对于那些历史上有问题或作风不好、脱离群众的党员，他们也一再地向党的领导机关提意见，认为某某人不能留在党内作党员，应当开除党籍。并说：“过去领导干部不睁眼，随便发展党，使那些坏分子得以混进党的组织里来。今后发展新党员时应当问一问咱们，徵求一下咱们的意见。”在经过民主改革之后，大批的新的积极分子热烈地要求加入共产党、加入青年团。这说明工矿企业中的民主改革不仅为开展爱国主义的劳动竞赛、实行经济核算制、迎接伟大的生产建设工作创造了有利的条件，而且为我们在工矿企业中的整党、建党和整顿青年团的组织、建设青年团的工作也清除了障碍，创造了有利的条件。
