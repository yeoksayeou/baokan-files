Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 12th: A Tokyo dispatch from the Electrical Communications Agency states: The latest issue of the "Toyo Keizai Shinpo" magazine clearly expresses the desire of Japanese businessmen to trade with China. Okamoto Tadashi, General Manager of Daiichi Trading Co., complained that the cost of Japanese steel is very high because iron ore and coal must be imported from the United States. He went on to say:

    "If we can obtain ore and coal from China, the problem of excessively high steel prices can be solved." He also said: "We admire and thank the Chinese traders for their enthusiasm in reopening trade with Japan." Shozo Yamamoto, manager of Kyoei Trading Co., emphasized the value of purchasing salt from China, because Chinese salt is both cheap and useful.

Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: According to a dispatch from the Electrical Communications Agency in Prague on the 10th, Japanese dispatches report that Japanese industrial circles are beginning to doubt the form of US-Japan economic cooperation planned by American monopoly capitalists. There is a growing view in Japan that it would be best for Japanese business circles to seek cooperation with China.

    The report points out that the Japanese iron and steel industry is now forced to buy American coal at $30 a ton, and cannot buy Chinese coal at $17 a ton. This seriously affects the ability of the Japanese iron and steel industry to compete in the international market. The impact on the Japanese textile industry due to the loss of the Chinese market is even more serious.

    Before the war, 51 percent of Japan's exports and 46 percent of its imports depended on the Asian continent. Therefore, Japan's heavy industrial centers are located in places where it is most convenient to import industrial materials (especially iron ore and coal from China). Japan relies on China for soybeans, soybean oil, salt and other industrial materials, and China is a good market for Japanese textiles, steel, machinery and other refined products.

    When the US ordered the virtual cessation of trade with China on December 7 last year, the order came so suddenly that even the Japanese officials in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry responsible for trade with China were taken aback when they saw the order in the newspaper. At the same time, American monopoly capitalists placed orders with Japan for munitions and supplies for the Korean War.

    As a result, Japanese comprador-style monopoly capitalists have made huge profits, while small industrialists and merchants have been severely hit by inflation. At the same time, the real wages of Japanese workers have decreased, and they are forced to work under bayonets.

    日本商人愿与我通商
    日工业界不满美国垄断日本贸易
    【新华社讯】电通社布拉格十二日讯：东京航讯说：在“东洋经济新报”杂志最近一期中，已明白的表示出日本商人要与中国贸易的愿望。第一通商公司总经理冈本正抱怨说：由于铁矿砂和煤都必须由美国输入，致使日本钢的成本很高。他接着说：
    “只要我们能够获得中国的矿砂和煤，钢的价格过高的问题，就可以解决。”他又说：“我们非常佩服和感谢中国贸易家对重新开放对日贸易的热情。”共荣商事公司经理山本省三强调从中国购得食盐的价值，因为中国的盐既便宜又有用。
    【新华社十二日讯】据电通社布拉格十日讯：据日本的航讯报道：日本工业界开始怀疑美国垄断资本家所策划的美日经济合作的方式。日本近来有这样的见解，认为日本工商界最好能谋得和中国的合作。
    该报道指出：日本炼铁工业现在被迫购买美国三十美元一吨的煤，而不能购买十七美元一吨的中国煤，此事严重地影响到日本炼铁业在国际市场竞争的能力。日本纺织业因失去中国市场所受到的影响更为严重。
    日本在战前出口的百分之五十一，入口的百分之四十六，都是靠亚洲大陆。因此，日本重工业中心是座落在输入工业物资（特别是中国的铁矿和煤）最为方便的地方。日本靠中国供给大豆、豆油、食盐和其他工业物资，而中国又是日本纺织品、钢铁、机器和其他精制品销售的良好市场。
    当去年十二月七日，美方命令实际停止与中国的贸易时，命令来得如此突然，甚至通商产业省负责中国贸易的日本官员在报上看见命令时也大吃一惊。同时，美国的垄断资本家则向日本订购供给朝鲜战争的军火和供应品。
    因此，使日本买办式的垄断资本家获得了庞大的利润，而小工业家和商人则因通货膨胀遭到严重的打击。同时，日本工人的实际工资减少了，他们被迫在刺刀之下工作。
