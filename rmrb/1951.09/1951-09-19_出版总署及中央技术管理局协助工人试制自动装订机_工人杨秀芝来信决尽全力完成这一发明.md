The General Administration of Press and Publication and the Central Technical Administration Assist Workers in Trial-Manufacturing Automatic Bookbinding Machines

Worker Yang Xiuzhi Writes a Letter Resolving to Do Everything Possible to Complete This Invention

Editor:

In the old society, I was a bookbinding worker in a "signature gathering workshop." I worked for fifteen years, enduring contempt and trampling, constantly threatened with unemployment, here today and there tomorrow, how could I work in peace?

When Zhangjiakou was liberated in 1945, I joined the revolutionary ranks and saw the light! I deeply felt the warmth that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army gave me. I worked hard and tried my best to teach my skills to my comrades. After the Party's cultivation, I understood a lot of revolutionary principles. In 1948, I gloriously joined the Communist Party.

In my long-term work, I always thought about contributing more to the country, so that I could be worthy of the Party and the people. But even if I put in all my effort, what else could I do? Last year, our factory launched a new record creation movement, and I was thinking about how to improve my work, wanting to replace manual bookbinding with machines. After I raised this idea, it was reviewed by the leaders, who thought it could be tested. First, I was asked to make small models, and later I was taken off production to specialize in testing. The higher authorities allocated over ten million yuan for testing expenses. Since the People's Daily pointed out on August 15th that attention should be paid to the invention of bookbinding machines, the General Administration of Press and Publication of the Central People's Government immediately submitted a request to the Cultural and Educational Committee, which approved over 140 million yuan as travel expenses for me to visit existing bookbinding tools in Shanghai and Northeast China and for future experimental expenses. On September 6th, the Central Technical Administration held a symposium, presided over by Director Zhong himself, who put forward suggestions for improving the bookbinding machine model at the meeting. The General Administration of Press and Publication designated a comrade with experience in printing machinery, and the Central Technical Administration designated a staff member to accompany me to visit Shanghai and Northeast China, so as to better absorb experience and avoid detours. After returning, the Central Technical Administration will convene a second symposium to formulate a trial-manufacturing plan, and then specific experiments can be carried out.

Editor: My experience in the revolutionary ranks for the past six years is an experience of the Party educating me and cultivating me in every possible way. The Party, administration, and trade union of my factory first gave me support, and the working class and the People's Daily and the Workers' Daily across the country have given me support, and the General Administration of Press and Publication and the Central Technical Administration have given me concrete help in terms of financial and human resources, so that the bookbinding machine can continue to be researched. These things were unthinkable in the old society, even in dreams!

Editor: I have nothing else to say, except to express to you and to the people of the whole country: I swear to do my best, to devote all my efforts, to humbly listen to the opinions of others, so that the automatic bookbinding machine can be successful as soon as possible, to repay everyone's care and support!

专栏：对人民日报读者地批评建议的反应

    出版总署及中央技术管理局协助工人试制自动装订机
    工人杨秀芝来信决尽全力完成这一发明编辑同志：
    我在旧社会是一个“帖套坊”做装订的工人。我作了十五年工，受尽了鄙视与践踏，随时都有失业的威胁，今天在这里，明天到那里，那能安心做工呢？
    一九四五年张家口解放时，我就参加了革命队伍，从此见到了光明！我深切地体会着共产党、解放军给我的温暖，我努力工作、尽量把技术教给同志们。经过党对我的培养，我懂得了不少的革命道理。一九四八年我光荣地参加了共产党。
    在长期的工作中，我总在想自己要多为国家贡献些力量，才对得起党和人民。可是劲头使足了，还有什么办法呢？去年我们厂里开展创造新纪录运动，我就捉摸着把我的工作改进一下，想把用手工装订的方法改用机器代替。当我把这个主意提出来以后，经过领导同志审查，认为可以试验。先让我搞小模型，后来又让我脱离生产，专门试验。上级拨了一千余万元的试验费。自从八月十五日人民日报提出应当重视装订机的发明以后，中央人民政府出版总署即呈请文化教育委员会，批准一亿四千多万元，作为我到上海、东北参观现有装订工具的旅费和将来实验的经费。九月六日，中央技术管理局召开座谈会，由锺局长亲自主持，他在会上对装订机模型提出了改进的意见。出版总署指定一位对印刷机械有经验的同志，中央技术管理局指定一位工作人员，协同我到上海、东北参观，以便更好地吸取经验，少走弯路。回来以后，再由中央技术管理局召集第二次座谈会，拟定试制方案，就可以进行具体实验了。
    编辑同志：我参加革命队伍六年来的经历，是党用一切方法教育我，培养我的经历。我厂党、行政、工会首先给我支持，全国工人阶级、人民日报，工人日报对我又加以支持，出版总署、中央技术管理局在财力、人力方面给我以具体帮助，使得装订机得以继续研究下去。这些事情在旧社会是任何人在做梦里也不敢想的啊！
    编辑同志：我没有别的话说，只有向你、向全国人民表示：我誓尽全力，拿出全部心血，虚心听取别人的意见，使自动装订机能够早日成功，以报答大家对我的关怀与扶植！华北军区政治部印刷厂杨秀芝
