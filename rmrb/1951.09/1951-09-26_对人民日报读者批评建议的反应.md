    Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily
    The Editorial Department of Songjiang Daily's Self-Criticism Regarding Insufficient Emphasis on Promoting the Trade Union Law
    To the Editors:
    The "Letters from Readers" column in the July 28th People's Daily published Comrade Zhou Ruiwu's criticism of our insufficient emphasis on promoting the Trade Union Law. We believe this criticism is correct and beneficial. In addition to humbly accepting it, we offer the following self-criticism:
    Our promotion of the Trade Union Law has indeed been inadequate. The main reasons are: our understanding of the importance of relying on the working class is not clear enough, and we usually lack serious systematic study and research on policies. We do not truly understand that implementing the Trade Union Law can promote the faster development of trade union organizations, further enhance the consciousness of the working class, unleash high levels of enthusiasm for production, and strengthen the great role of national economic construction. Therefore, when the Trade Union Law was first promulgated, we discovered relatively serious problems and focused on reporting them; but as the work transitioned to a regular basis, we gradually relaxed and neglected the promotion of the Trade Union Law. Because our understanding of the importance of relying on the working class is not clear enough, we have also failed to proactively and regularly organize relevant department correspondents to report, especially on the first anniversary of the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, when our newspaper did not even publish a single news item.
    Comrade Zhou Ruiwu's criticism has made us aware of the shortcomings in our work. In order to prevent similar errors from occurring in the future, we have decided to strengthen policy study, strengthen investigation and research, and strengthen the newspaper's mass work to improve our newspaper work.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    松江日报编辑部关于不重视宣传工会法的检讨编辑同志：
    七月二十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了周瑞武同志对于我们不重视宣传工会法的批评，我们认为这个批评是正确的和有益的。除虚心接受外，并做如下检讨：
    我们对工会法的宣传，确实是不够的。主要原因是：我们对依靠工人阶级的思想不够明确，平素对政策又缺乏认真地系统地学习和研究。我们还不真正了解贯彻执行工会法，可以推动工会组织更快地发展，进一步提高工人阶级的觉悟，发挥高度生产热情，加强国家经济建设的伟大作用。因此，在工会法刚颁布时，发现了比较严重的问题，曾抓紧报道；但当工作转入经常之后，就逐渐放松和忽视了对工会法的宣传。由于我们对依靠工人阶级思想不够明确，因此，也未能主动地经常地组织有关部门通讯员进行报道，特别是在工会法颁布一周年的时候，我们的报纸连一条消息也未登。
    周瑞武同志的批评，使我们认识到我们工作中的缺点。为了使今后不再发生类似错误，我们决定加强政策学习，加强调查研究和报社的群众工作，来改进我们报纸工作。  松江日报编辑部
