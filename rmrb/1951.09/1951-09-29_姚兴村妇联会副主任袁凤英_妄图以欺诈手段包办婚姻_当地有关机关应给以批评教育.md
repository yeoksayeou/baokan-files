Yuan Fengying, the Deputy Director of the Women's Federation of the Second Branch Village of Yaoxing Village, Seventh District, Nanling County, Southern Anhui, not only does not care about women's legitimate demands for divorce, but also attempts to arrange marriages by fraudulent means, a behavior that is extremely vile. Zhang Yinzi, a poor peasant woman from the village, is nineteen years old this year. When she was fourteen years old, her parents arranged for her to be a child bride to Zhang Wangzi, and she was forced to marry him at seventeen. They quarreled on the night of the wedding, and then quarreled frequently, both sides feeling very painful.

After the Marriage Law was promulgated last year, cadres from the district came to the village to publicize the Marriage Law. After that, Zhang Yinzi proposed a divorce to her husband, but the man firmly disagreed. In July of this year, Zhang Yinzi went to Yuan Fengying, the Deputy Director of the village Women's Federation, to request a solution to her marriage problem. She went three times, but Yuan Fengying hadn't gotten out of bed. When she finally found her, Yuan Fengying didn't care. Zhang Yinzi had no choice but to go to the Land Reform Work Team for help. The comrades of the work team were very responsible and immediately invited Yuan Fengying and Zhang Wangzi to explain the situation and wrote a letter of introduction to the district government. Yuan Fengying accompanied Zhang and Zhang to the district government three times and finally got a divorce.

After the divorce, Yuan Fengying kept Zhang Yinzi in her own home, coaxing Zhang Yinzi to marry Wu Zongfa. Zhang Yinzi disagreed, and Yuan Fengying threatened her, saying, "If you don't listen to me, I'll be rude to you!" Zhang Yinzi was frightened and ran to a friend's house that night. The next day, Yuan Fengying found Zhang Yinzi and said, "If you don't listen to me, I won't allow you to leave the village, and I'll also demand back three days' worth of food expenses, at three catties of rice per day according to the old scale; in addition, I ran to the district on your behalf for three days, and I'll charge you five catties of rice per day. If you listen to me, I won't demand a single grain of rice." Zhang Yinzi had no choice and was trembling with fear.

Yuan Fengying's behavior is extremely wrong. The reason why Zhang Yinzi wanted a divorce was because she was dissatisfied with the past arranged and unreasonable marriage. After the divorce she wanted to choose her own partner and live a happy life. Yuan Fengying used extortion as a means to force her to marry Wu Zongfa. This behavior completely violates the Marriage Law and the principle of freedom of marriage. The People's Government and the Women's Federation of the Seventh District of Nanling County should conduct strict criticism and education of Yuan Fengying's erroneous behavior and thinking, strengthen the publicity of the Marriage Law, and earnestly implement the Marriage Law.

    姚兴村妇联会副主任袁凤英
    妄图以欺诈手段包办婚姻
    当地有关机关应给以批评教育
    皖南南陵县第七区姚兴村第二分村妇女联合会副主任袁凤英，不但不关心妇女的正当离婚要求，反想以欺诈手段包办婚姻，行为极端恶劣。该村贫农妇女章银子，今年十九岁，十四岁时由父母作主，许给张旺子做童养媳，十七岁时被迫结婚。结婚当晚就吵了架，以后又经常吵闹，双方都感到十分痛苦。
    去年婚姻法公布后，区里的干部来这村宣传婚姻法。之后，章银子就向丈夫提出离婚，但男方坚不同意。今年七月间，章银子又找村妇女联合会副主任袁凤英，请求解决婚姻问题。连找三次，袁凤英都还没起床。以后找到了，袁凤英却不管。章银子没办法，就找到土地改革工作组，请求帮助。工作组的同志很负责，立即请来袁凤英、张旺子说明道理，写了到区政府去的介绍信。袁凤英陪着章、张二人连去区政府三次，终于离了婚。
    离婚以后，袁凤英把章银子留在自己家里，哄骗着章银子要她与吴宗法结婚。章银子不同意，袁凤英就威胁她说：“你要不依我作，我就对你不客气！”章银子心里害怕，当晚跑到了朋友家里。第二天，袁凤英找到章银子说：“你要不依我，我就不允许你出村，还要追还我三天的伙食费，每天大米老秤三斤；另外我为你向区里跑了三天，每天要你认大米五斤。如果依我，一粒米也不要。”章银子没有办法，吓得发抖。
    袁凤英的行为是极端错误的。章银子之所以要离婚，是因为不满意过去包办的不合理的婚姻，是要在离婚以后，自己选择对象，要过美好的生活。袁凤英竟以诈索财物为手段，强迫她与吴宗法结婚，这种行为，完全违背婚姻法，完全违反婚姻自主的原则。南陵县第七区人民政府和妇女联合会，应对袁凤英的错误行为与思想，进行严格的批评与教育，并加强婚姻法的宣传，认真贯彻婚姻法。
