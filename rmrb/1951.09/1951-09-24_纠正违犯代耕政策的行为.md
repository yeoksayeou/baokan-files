    Correcting Actions that Violate the Policy of Substitute Farming

    The Datong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Chahar Province, during its inspection of preferential treatment work, discovered that many cadres were enjoying excessively high substitute farming benefits, violating the policy of substitute farming. The most serious case involved Zhao Qing, the Organization Committee Member of the Fourth District Committee of the CCP in the county. His family of four had 32 mu of land, and according to the substitute farming principles, only a portion should be substitute farmed. However, his family members insisted on having all of it substitute farmed, demanding 200 workdays from the village cadres, equivalent to 1,400 jin of rice. After receiving the rice, they spent it recklessly and used the remaining 600+ jin of millet to engage in usury, lending it out in the spring and demanding repayment in the autumn with a 50% interest rate. The masses reacted very negatively. This kind of violation of the substitute farming policy is not unique to a few places.

    Why did this error occur? On one hand, the village cadres had a "sense of personal favor." They did not act based on policy but instead acted based on who the person was, trying to please their superiors. On the other hand, and more importantly, some cadres had selfish, self-interested thoughts and an idea of privilege for meritorious individuals. These cadres did not see the difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, nor did they see the burden-bearing capacity of the masses. Instead, they directly wrote letters to the village cadres, asking them to give their family members special care. These cadres do not understand that the great victory of the Chinese people nationwide is inseparable from the countless revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who shed blood, sacrificed themselves, and fought bravely. They have rendered meritorious service to the people, and the people should respect them. Their family members should be given preferential treatment and consolation. Therefore, the principle of preferential treatment of the Party and the government is martyrs' families first, then soldiers' families, and then workers' families. This is fully in line with the demands of the people. All localities must adhere to this principle and struggle against all phenomena that violate this principle, and strive to correctly implement the policy of preferential treatment.

    纠正违犯代耕政策的行为
    中共察哈尔大同县委在检查优抚工作中，发现不少干部享受了过高的代耕待遇，违犯了代耕政策。其中最严重的，如该县中共四区区委组织委员赵青，全家四口，地三十二亩，按代耕原则只应代耕一部，但其家属强要全部代耕，向村干部要工二百个，折米一、四○○斤。领米后胡花乱用，并将余下的六百多斤小米，放了高利贷。春借秋还，利息五分。群众反应很坏。像这种违反代耕政策的现象，还不是个别地方仅有的。
    为什么会发生这种错误呢？一方面村干部存在着
    “人情观念”，他们不是从政策出发，而是看人作事，向上级讨好。另一方面，也是主要的，部分干部有自私自利、功臣特权思想，这些干部看不到烈军属困难，看不到群众的负担能力，而直接写信要村干部给他们的家属以特别照顾。这些干部不懂得中国人民之所以取得全国的伟大胜利，是与无数革命先烈、革命战士流血牺牲、英勇斗争分不开的。他们有功于人民，人民应当尊敬他们，对他们的家属，要进行优待抚恤。因此，党和政府的优抚原则，是先烈属次军属再工属。这是完全符合人民的要求的。各地必须坚持这一原则，同一切违反这一原则的现象进行斗争，为正确贯彻优抚政策而努力。
