Dear fellow compatriots of the capital! Comrades!

We, the Delegation of Combat Heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to attend the National Day observation, have returned to the capital of the motherland from the Korean front. We are greatly honored to receive such a warm welcome from the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression and Aid Korea, various democratic parties, representatives of combat heroes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, various people's organizations, and representatives from all sectors of the capital. On behalf of all comrades in our delegation, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and extend our revolutionary greetings!

Our delegation represents all the comrades of the Volunteer Army on the Korean front, coming to participate in our motherland's National Day celebration and to congratulate our motherland on its growing prosperity and strength. Every comrade fighting on the Korean front is deeply concerned about our motherland, and every comrade knows full well that the combat task we are undertaking in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea is also the combat task of defending our motherland. Only by resolutely striking at the aggressors can we safeguard the security and construction of our motherland. Therefore, every comrade is firmly carrying out the glorious task entrusted to us by the people of the motherland. The comrades at the front are deeply concerned about our great leader Chairman Mao. When we left the troops, the comrades instructed us to represent everyone in sending greetings to Chairman Mao and wishing him good health.

Entrusted by the people of the motherland, our Volunteer Army has been fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean front for eleven months. The people of the motherland are very concerned about the Korean front. The comrades at the front instructed us to report to the people of the motherland on our Volunteer Army's combat situation on the front when we return to the motherland, so that the people of the motherland can understand how their dearest sons are heroically striking at the American aggressors on the Korean front.

The comrades at the front also instructed our delegation to bring back to the front and report to them the prosperous scene of our motherland's production and construction, and the high enthusiasm of the people of the motherland in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea and actively donating aircraft and artillery to support the front, which we have seen with our own eyes.

This is the task entrusted to us by our comrades-in-arms on the Korean front. All the comrades in our delegation must do our utmost to accomplish these tasks.

This time, our delegation is able to participate in the solemn and grand National Day celebration in the capital of the motherland, to see our most beloved and missed leader Chairman Mao, and today we have received a warm welcome from the people of all walks of life in the capital. We feel extremely honored. This is the glory of all the comrades of our Volunteer Army, and this is the glory of our great motherland and the people of our motherland.

Glory to our great motherland!

Glory to the people of our great motherland!

Glory to our great leader Chairman Mao!
