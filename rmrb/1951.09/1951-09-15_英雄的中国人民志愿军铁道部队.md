    The Heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps
    Hong Liu, Jian Qun, Wang Xuejian
    In Korea, there is a railway corps composed of Chinese People's Volunteers, affectionately known as the "Railway Soldiers" of China by the Korean people. These "Railway Soldiers," together with the Korean People's Army Railway Corps and Korean railway workers, have launched a heroic and tenacious struggle.
    On the Korean battlefield, repairing railway transport lines is an arduous task. The warriors repairing railway lines not only have to fight against frequent enemy aircraft, but also against the cold currents in winter and floods in spring. Many repair materials and tools also need to be resolved locally. However, all these difficulties have been overcome one by one in the face of the highly conscious commanders and fighters of the railway corps. For example, in order to avoid enemy aircraft from destroying train equipment, they cleverly established water supply stations or used mountain springs for water supply; when wood was lacking, the commanders and fighters went to the mountains and forests to cut it down; when spikes were lacking, they searched for them near the railway lines. Sometimes, when some heavy equipment could not be transported to the construction site in time, the commanders and fighters often created simple tools to replace them. For example, when erecting the I-beams of a certain bridge, because the girder erecting machine had not been transported, Wang Chuanming, a scaffolder, used a 30-ton flatcar to form a crane to replace the girder erecting machine. As a result, not only was the task completed ahead of schedule, but also 80 man-days were saved compared to using the girder erecting machine.
    Every soldier in the Volunteer Army Railway Corps demonstrated a high degree of work enthusiasm and perseverance in the repair work. Every time enemy aircraft came to harass, they dropped a large number of time bombs. It has become commonplace for them to move the time bombs away or carry out repair work in the gaps between the explosions of the time bombs. A young Communist Party member, Wang Guozhang, made a great contribution because of this. In early March, enemy aircraft dropped several bombs near a large ten-arch bridge in a certain area, including two time bombs weighing more than one ton, one falling on the bank and the other falling into the river at the foot of the pier. On a cold, bone-chilling night, Wang Guozhang and his comrades accepted the task of pulling up these two time bombs. The bomb that fell on the bank was quickly pulled away by them with a long rope, but it was difficult to pull out the bomb that fell in the river. At that time, Comrade Wang Guozhang volunteered to take off his clothes and jump into the frozen river. He groped in the water for a long time but still did not find the bomb. His comrades on the shore wanted to replace him, but Wang Guozhang refused. He stuck his head out of the water to breathe for a while, and then drilled to the bottom of the water again. Before long, the bomb, which could explode at any time, was finally found by him, fastened with a rope, and pulled out by everyone working together. For example, a certain bridge was bombed by enemy aircraft 28 times in one day, and there were more than 400 bomb craters around it. Despite the enemy's frantic bombing, the "Railway Soldiers" used their wisdom and courage to protect and repair the bridge, so that trains continued to run across the bridge.
    The famous high-altitude hero Yang Liandi also participated in the Volunteer Army's aid to Korea's railway corps. He has made several great contributions in Korea. Once, a certain bridge was bombed and damaged, and the troops responsible for the repair work encountered serious difficulties due to the lack of materials. There were usable materials on an isolated steel beam. If anyone could climb up and take them down, the difficulty of the lack of materials could be solved. The pier supporting this steel beam was 17 meters high, making it difficult to climb up by hand. If scaffolding was built or other tools were used to climb up, there would not only be insufficient materials, but also a lot of manpower would be required, which was not allowed in the case of very urgent repair tasks. After Communist Party member Yang Liandi learned about this situation, he requested the leader to give him the task of climbing high. After carefully examining the pier and the surrounding terrain and the tilted steel beams, he found that there was a steel rail more than ten meters long hanging diagonally on the steel beam. The heroic Yang Liandi relied on his skilled climbing skills to climb the 17-meter-high pier from a steel rail without scaffolding, and took down the required materials, ensuring the smooth progress of the repair task.

    英雄的中国人民志愿军铁道部队
    洪流、简群、王学俭
    在朝鲜，有一支由中国人民志愿组成的铁道部队，他们被朝鲜人民亲密地称为中国的“铁道兵”。这些“铁道兵”和朝鲜人民军铁道部队、朝鲜铁路员工一道展开了英勇坚强的斗争。
    在朝鲜战场上，抢修铁道运输线是个艰巨的任务。抢修铁道线路的勇士们，不但要和频繁的敌机作斗争，在冬天还要和寒流作斗争，在春天又要和洪水作斗争，许多抢修的材料、工具也须就地解决。但是这一切困难，在具有高度觉悟的铁道部队指战员们面前，都一一被克服了。譬如为了避免敌机破坏行车设备，他们很巧妙地建立了给水所，或利用山上的泉水给水；木料缺乏，指战员们就到山林中去砍伐；道钉缺乏，就到铁路线附近去搜集。有的时候，一些重器材不能及时运到工地，指战员们常常先创造简便的工具来代替。如在架某桥工字梁时，因为架梁机未运到，架子工王传明便利用三十吨的平车组成吊车来代替架梁机，结果不但提前完成任务，而且比用架梁机还要省八十个人工。
    志愿军铁道部队的每一个战士，在抢修工作中都表现了高度的工作热情和坚韧。敌机每次来骚扰都要投下大量的定时炸弹，把定时炸弹搬走，或在定时炸弹爆炸的空隙中进行抢修工作，在他们已成为平常的事了。一个年青的共产党员王国章就因此立了一个大功。三月初，敌机在某地一座十孔大桥附近投掷数枚炸弹，其中有两枚一吨多重的定时炸弹，一枚落在岸旁，一枚落在桥墩脚下的江水中。在一个寒风刺骨的黑夜里，王国章和他的战友们接受了拉起这两枚定时炸弹的任务。落在岸上的那枚炸弹，很快地被他们用长绳拉走了，但是要拉出落在江水中的那一枚炸弹就困难了。当时王国章同志自告奋勇地脱下衣服，跳入冰冻的江水中去。他在水中摸了好一会仍是没有摸着炸弹。岸上的同志要来换他，王国章拒绝了。他把头伸出水面稍稍呼吸一下，又钻到水底去了。不一会，这颗随时都可能爆炸的炸弹终于被他摸着，扣上绳子，由大家同心合力拉了出来。再如某桥曾在一天中遭受敌机轰炸二十八次，四周的弹坑有四百余个，尽管敌机这样地狂轰滥炸，但“铁道兵”们用自己的智慧与英勇保护和修好了桥梁，使火车仍然继续不断地从桥上行驶过去。
    著名的登高英雄杨连第也参加了志愿援朝的铁道部队。他在朝鲜又先后立了数次大功。有一次某桥被炸坏，担负抢修任务的部队因为材料缺乏，遇到了严重的困难。在一孔孤立的钢梁上却有能用的材料，如果谁能爬上去取下来，就可以解决材料缺乏的困难。架着这个钢梁的桥墩有十七米高，很难徒手上去，若搭脚手架或用其他工具往上攀登，不但没有足够的材料，并且要费很多人工，这在抢修任务十分急紧的情况下是不容许的。共产党员杨连第了解到这种情况后，就请求首长把这个登高任务交给他。他经过细心地察看桥墩与四周的地势及倒歪的钢梁后，发现有一根十多米长的钢轨斜悬在钢梁上。英勇的杨连第便凭着他熟练的登高技术，从一根钢轨上不用搭脚手架而攀登上十七米高的桥墩，取下了所需的材料，保证了抢修任务的顺利进行。
