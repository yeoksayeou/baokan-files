Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky received French Charge d'Affaires ad interim Brionval on September 11th and handed him a note from the Soviet government. The Soviet note sternly condemns the measures taken by the French government, in conjunction with the U.S. and British governments, to revive German militarism and prepare to establish a military alliance with West German aggressive forces, as a violation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the Potsdam Agreement, and once again warns the French government that it should be held responsible for this situation and its consequences.

The note begins by stating: In its notes of December 15, 1950, and January 20, 1951, the Soviet government has already drawn the attention of the French government to the fact that the French government's policy of condoning revanchists in West Germany undermines the basis and essence of the 1944 Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance and violates the Potsdam Agreement, to which France is a party. It is now clear that the measures taken by the French government in conjunction with the U.S. and British governments not only violate the Franco-Soviet Treaty and the Potsdam Agreement, but also create the danger of a recurrence of German aggression. These measures have the character of openly preparing to form a military alliance with West German aggressive forces. This has been proven by the French government's Pleven Plan and Schuman Plan.

The note points out: The Pleven Plan for establishing a "European Army," proposed by the French government at the instigation of the U.S. government, is to legitimize the German army currently being formed in West Germany under the guise of incorporating it as part of the "European Army." In this joint army, the West German army is bound to occupy a dominant position. Therefore, the Pleven Plan is a serious threat to European peace, and it gravely violates France's obligations under the Franco-Soviet Treaty on taking joint action to prevent new German aggression in Europe, as well as France's obligations under the Potsdam Agreement with the U.S. and Britain on eliminating German militarism.

The note also points out: The Schuman Plan for the organization of the "European Coal and Steel Community," which supplements the Pleven Plan, is to legitimize the restoration of West Germany's Ruhr military industry and to create conditions for ensuring that the Ruhr industrial magnates occupy a dominant position in West European armaments and munitions production. Thus, the Potsdam Agreement on prohibiting war industries and eliminating German monopoly capital, which was particularly responsible for the Second World War, is being brutally violated and trampled upon by the countries responsible for the occupation of West Germany.

The note states: The people of all countries still have vivid memories of the horrors of the Second World War. The French people, like the Soviet people, cannot forget the disasters and losses they suffered. The people of Europe have vowed to prevent a third world war and to stop the danger of German aggression from recurring as soon as possible. Everyone knows that before the Second World War, due to the policy of the French, American and British ruling classes intending to use German militarism, the French government also violated the 1935 Franco-Soviet Treaty, which enabled Hitler to launch the Second World War, and France had to pay a heavy price for its erroneous policy by being occupied by Germany for a long time. Now, the French, American, and British governments are embarking on the old road of intending to use German militarism to prepare for another war. In the current tense international situation, the people of France and the Soviet Union, like all peace-loving people, must jointly defend peace and not allow the friendship between the people of all countries to be weakened.

The note concludes by declaring: "The Soviet government cannot but take note of the consequences of the French government's current policy, which is to restore German militarism and establish a military alliance with West Germany's aggressive forces. The Soviet government considers it necessary to once again warn the French government, reminding it of the responsibility it should bear for the situation that has arisen and the consequences arising therefrom."

    苏联再次照会法政府斥法国破坏法苏条约
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长维辛斯基九月十一日接见法国驻苏联代理代办布列翁瓦，交予苏联政府照会一件。苏联照会严正指责法国政府会同美英政府所采取的复活德国军国主义，并准备与西德侵略力量建立军事同盟的措施违背了法苏同盟互助条约及波茨坦协定，并再度警告法国政府对这种情势及其后果应负责任。
    照会首称：苏联政府曾经在一九五○年十二月十五日和一九五一年一月二十日两次照会中提起法国政府注意：法国政府对西德所施行的放纵复仇主义者的政策，破坏了一九四四年法苏同盟互助条约的基础及其要义，并违背了法国参加的波茨坦协定。现在已经十分明白，法国政府会同美英两国政府所采取的措施，不仅违背法苏条约和波茨坦协定，而且还造成了德国侵略重演的危险。这些措施具有公开准备与西德侵略力量结成军事同盟的性质。这一点已经由法国政府的普利文计划和舒曼计划证明了。
    照会指出：在美国政府授意下，法国政府所提建立“欧洲军”的普利文计划，是要在把西德军队作为“欧洲军”的一部分这种伪装下，将西德正在编建中的德国军队合法化。而在这个联军中，西德军队必然要占支配地位。因此，普利文计划是对于欧洲和平的严重威胁，它严重地违背法国根据关于采取共同行动防止德国在欧洲进行新侵略的法苏条约所担负的义务，同样也违背了法美英三国根据关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定所担负的义务。
    照会并指出：辅助普利文计划的组织“欧洲煤钢联营”的舒曼计划，是要把恢复西德鲁尔军火工业合法化，并为保证鲁尔工业大王在西欧军备和军火生产中占据支配地位创造了条件。这样，关于禁止战争工业及消灭对第二次世界大战负特别责任的德国垄断资本的波茨坦协定，正遭到负责占领西德的国家横暴的破坏和蹂躏。
    照会说：各国人民对第二次世界大战的恐怖记忆犹新。法国人民也和苏联人民一样不能忘却他们所遭受的灾害和损失，欧洲人民已经发誓要防止第三次世界大战，并及早制止德国再度发动侵略的危险。谁都知道，在第二次世界大战以前，由于法美英统治阶级打算利用德国军国主义的政策，法国政府并破坏了一九三五年的法苏条约，使得希特勒能够发动第二次世界大战，法国不得不为自己的错误政策付出了遭德国长期占领的沉重代价。现在，法、美、英国政府又走上打算利用德国军国主义来准备另一次战争的老路了。在目前紧张的国际形势中，法苏两国人民，如同全体爱好和平的人民一样，必须共同保卫和平，不得容许各国人民间的友谊受到削弱。
    照会最后宣称：“苏联政府不能不注意到法国政府现行政策的后果，因为这个政策是要恢复德国军国主义，并与西德的侵略势力建立军事同盟。苏联政府认为，必须再度向法国政府警告，提醒它对于已经发生的局势及由此而引起的后果所应负的责任。”
