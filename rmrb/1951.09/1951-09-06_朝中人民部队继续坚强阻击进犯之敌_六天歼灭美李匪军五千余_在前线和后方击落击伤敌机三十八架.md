    【Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 5th】Our front-line reporter reports: The US invading army and the Li pseudo-army, deliberately clinging to their war policy, and disregarding the heavy losses they have suffered in their frequent and reckless northward advances, have launched offensives in the areas north of Linjie, Yangkou, and Huachuan in the eastern front after hastily regrouping and replenishing their forces. From August 29th to September 3rd, the US-Li armies, each with forces ranging from two companies to two battalions, continuously and fiercely attacked our 923.8 height north of Linjie, the Jiuhyan 900 height, 901, 773.1, and 1054.9 heights north and northeast of Yangkou, and the Hei Yun Tu Ling, Jiu Dai, 460.5, 565, and 818.9 heights north of Huachuan. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army continued to resolutely repulse the invading enemy. At the Jiuhyan 900, 773.1, and 923.8 heights, they repelled the enemy's fierce attacks eight to more than ten times in a row, inflicting heavy losses on them. In the area west of Tieyuan on the western front, small groups of US troops, under the cover of tanks, constantly harassed our forward positions. Our troops drove them away with fierce artillery fire every day. The US-Li armies suffered heavy casualties under the heavy blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. According to incomplete statistics from August 26th to 31st, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies annihilated a total of more than 5,400 enemy troops. Among them, more than 2,300 were US troops, and 3,106 were Li pseudo-troops. During these six days, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies shot down and damaged 38 enemy aircraft in the skies above the front and rear.
