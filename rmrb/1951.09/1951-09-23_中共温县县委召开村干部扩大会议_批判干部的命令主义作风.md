    CCP Wen County Committee Convenes Expanded Meeting of Village Cadres
    Criticizing Cadres' Commandist Work Style
    The commandist work style of some cadres in Wen County, Pingyuan Province, has seriously damaged the Party and government's work and prestige. In August, the CCP Wen County Committee held an expanded meeting of village cadres in the county to review and criticize this, calling on everyone to resolutely follow the mass line and complete various work tasks.
    The commandist work style among cadres in Wen County manifests itself in the following ways: For example, a farmer in Beizhangqiang asked a village cadre: "Is the sprayer any good? The masses in our street are saying they'll buy it if it's good, but not if it isn't!" The village cadre actually replied: "This proves that your street's suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not thorough enough!" In the cotton purchasing work, a village cadre in Liuxue Village, Fourth District, threatened the masses, saying: "Anyone who has cotton and doesn't sell it will be detained if it is discovered." Some village cadres, when their proposals were opposed by the masses, used words like "Are you dissatisfied with resisting America and aiding Korea?" "Do you have objections to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries?" to suppress the masses. Some villages forced the masses to donate, stipulating "5,000 yuan per person," and insisted that activists take the lead. At a meeting of all village cadres and activists, sixty people reported 600,000 yuan. The branch secretary felt it was too little and said, "This shows that your ideology is not correct, and we have to discuss it further. If necessary, we'll have to discuss it tomorrow and the day after tomorrow; we can't adjourn the meeting yet."
    The commandist work style of some cadres has developed to a very serious degree. When repairing the river sluice, Zhang Laohu, a middle peasant in Yuancun, refused to work because of his backward thinking. The village cadres did not try to persuade or mobilize him but dragged him to the Youth League office to struggle against him.
    In addition, some village cadres arbitrarily imposed fines and levies on the masses. For example, during the summer grain storage in Dashang Village, Second District, if some people did not attend meetings, the village chief decided to fine each person ten jin of millet. He also broadcast on the roof, saying that those who were late for the meeting would also be fined one day's work and not allowed to go home at night. The masses said, "If you want to fine us, don't beat us; if you want to beat us, don't fine us!" The village chief said, "We'll fine and beat you, and we'll double it. Those who are late will be fined twenty jin of millet each." On another occasion, because some people did not attend the meeting, the village chief said, "Each person will be fined four liang of oil." In Xiguan, First District, a certain villager was fined 100,000 yuan in silver dollars for bad behavior. A certain militiaman in Hecun was fined 30,000 yuan in silver dollars for arguing with the squad leader.
    The rise of commandism is inseparable from the rise of privileged thinking among some Party members and cadres. On the other hand, the main reason is that the leading organs and leading cadres of the Party and government have a bureaucratic work style, do not understand the situation at lower levels, and do not promptly check and correct the mistakes of cadres, which inevitably promotes the development of commandist work style.
    Through this meeting, everyone realized that the rise of commandism has caused great harm to the work and unanimously expressed that they would work hard to study and resolutely follow the mass line after returning to their villages.

### 中共温县县委召开村干部扩大会议  批判干部的命令主义作风

    中共温县县委召开村干部扩大会议
    批判干部的命令主义作风
    平原省温县部分干部的命令主义作风，已经严重地损害了党与政府的工作和威信。八月间，中共温县县委会在全县村干部扩大会议上，对此进行了检查和批判，号召大家要坚决走群众路线，完成各项工作任务。
    温县干部中的命令主义作风，有以下几种表现：例如北张羗一个农民问村干部：“喷雾器顶事不？俺街群众都说，顶事就买，不顶事就不买啦！”村里的干部竟答复道：“这证明你街镇压反革命就不彻底！”在购棉工作中，四区刘薛村村干部威吓群众说：“谁有棉不卖，查出来就得扣押起来。”有些村干部，当自己提出的意见遭受群众的反对时，就以“你不满意抗美援朝吗？”“你对镇压反革命有意见吗？”等话来压制群众。有的村庄强迫群众捐献，规定“每人五千元”，硬要积极分子带头。在全村干部积极分子会上，六十个人报了六十万元。支部书记嫌少，说：“这是思想不正确，还得讨论。弄不好，明天后天也得讨论，不能散会。”
    有些干部的命令主义作风，已经发展到十分严重程度。修河闸时，元村中农张老虎，因思想落后，抗工不做，村干部并未进行说服动员，就把张拉到青年团办公的地方进行斗争。
    另外，有些村干部，任意向群众罚粮罚款。例如二区大尚村在夏季屯粮时，有的群众开会不到，村长便决定每人罚小米十斤。又在房上广播，迟来开会的，还要罚工一日，晚上也不准回家。群众说：“要罚不打、要打不罚！”村长说：“又罚又打，还得加倍，迟到的每人要罚二十斤小米。”又一次，因开会时群众不到，村长就说：“每人罚油四两。”一区西关有个老百姓行为不好，被罚洋十万元。贺村某自卫队员因与班长顶嘴，就被罚洋三万元。
    命令主义作风的抬头，与部分党员干部特权思想的抬头是分不开的。另一方面，主要的是党和政府领导机关和领导干部存在着官僚主义作风，不了解下情，不及时检查纠正干部的错误，这样也就必然助长了命令主义作风的发展。
    经过这次会议，大家认识了命令主义的抬头，已给工作以极大危害，一致表示回村后要努力学习，坚决走群众路线。
