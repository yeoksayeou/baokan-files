    The "Witch" of Yuanbukou Village, Pingyu, Henan, is Harming People: The Local People's Government Should Immediately Ban Her Strictly

    To the Editorial Comrades:

    I am telling you about an incident of a "witch" harming people.

    Yuan Zhaoshi, a farmer in Yuanbukou Village, Mengwan Township, Pingyu County, Henan Province, had a little girl who became ill on August 1st. He did not seek medical treatment but instead invited Chen Yuan, a "witch" from Chenzhai Village, Third District, Xincai County, to perform a spirit possession to diagnose the illness. Chen Yuan babbled nonsense, saying that "the girl's illness is caused by a ghost," and told Yuan Zhaoshi to quickly chop the girl to death, otherwise he would never have children. Yuan Zhaoshi believed her and wanted to chop the girl to death at the time. Li Xiuyun, the director of the township women's federation, learned about this and educated him, telling him not to listen to the "witch." However, Yuan Zhaoshi did not listen. On August 10th, while the masses were busy farming in the fields, he secretly killed the child.

    It is understood that this "witch" has killed six children by spreading superstitious nonsense and deceiving the masses. There are many other instances of local "witches" promoting superstition and causing losses to the masses. This is a very serious matter. The local government should ban the illegal activities of "witches," and "witch" Chen Yuan should be punished according to law. In addition, thorough propaganda and education should be carried out among the broad masses to expose the poisonous effects of feudal superstition.

    河南平舆袁埠口村“神婆”为害
    当地人民政府应即严加取缔编辑同志：
    我告诉你们一件“神婆”害人的事。
    河南省平舆县孟湾乡袁埠口村农民袁照时的小女孩在八月一日有了病。他不请医生治疗，却请新蔡县三区陈寨村“神婆”陈袁氏下神看病。陈袁氏胡说什么“女孩得病是有鬼作祟”，叫袁照时快把女孩砍死，否则就一辈子不会有儿女。袁照时信以为真，当时就想把女孩砍死。该乡妇女联合会主任李秀云知道后，曾对他进行教育，叫他不要听“神婆”的话。但袁照时不听，在八月十日趁群众农忙下地时，偷着将小孩杀死。
    据了解，这个“神婆”乱说鬼话，欺骗群众已经害死了六个小孩。当地“神婆”宣传迷信，造成群众损失的事还很多。这是一个十分严重的事情。当地政府应取缔“神婆”非法活动，如“神婆”陈袁氏，应依法惩办，并向广大群众进行深入的宣传教育，揭露封建迷信思想的毒害。
