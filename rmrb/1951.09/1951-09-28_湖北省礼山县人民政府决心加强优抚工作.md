Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editors:

    The People's Daily published on July 25th a letter from Comrade Zhou Weiqun criticizing our county leadership's neglect of preferential treatment work, the existence of egalitarian tendencies in the distribution of subsidies to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and the embezzlement of subsidy grain by township cadres. After seeing the report, we immediately sent personnel to Xincheng Township to investigate. The investigation results are reported as follows:

    Xincheng Township distributed subsidy grain to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel once in the autumn of 1950. At that time, the leadership did not pay enough attention to this matter, and there were few cadres, with only one financial assistant in the district handling it. There was no good publicity of the preferential treatment policy to the masses beforehand, and no understanding of the situation. A meeting of representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel was hastily convened, and it was decided to distribute the grain according to population: 24 catties of rice per person for the first class, 20 catties of rice per person for the second class, and 16 catties of rice per person for the third class. At that time, land reform had not yet been carried out in the township, class boundaries were not clear, and the township cadres were not entirely pure. Therefore, Xu Jinrui, a rich peasant (family of a revolutionary martyr, six people) who did not need subsidies, was also given 120 catties of subsidy grain; while poor, widowed, and orphaned military dependents such as Gao Chen, Xu Liang, and Tian Li only received dozens of catties of subsidy grain. Regarding the criticism in the People's Daily that township cadres Tian Zhiyu and Tian Houyu embezzled the subsidy grain of military dependent Xiong Wenzhi (erroneously written as Xiong Wenzhan in the People's Daily), it has been learned that the two did attempt to embezzle the grain, but were discovered and stopped by the district government.

    This investigation has made us thoroughly aware of the serious consequences of neglecting preferential treatment work in the past. This is a concrete manifestation of our lack of a strong sense of responsibility. At present, the political consciousness of the masses has been greatly improved, and many people regard doing a good job in preferential treatment and substitute farming as a concrete action of patriotism. In the future, we will mobilize the masses to further actively help the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel solve their production and living difficulties, and conscientiously do a good job in preferential treatment work.
                                        Lishan County People's Government of Hubei Province

### 湖北省礼山县人民政府决心加强优抚工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    湖北省礼山县人民政府
    决心加强优抚工作编辑同志：
    贵报七月二十五日登载了周为群同志关于我县领导方面忽视优抚工作，发放烈属军属补助粮时存有平均主义偏向，及乡干部贪污补助粮的批评信。我们见报后，立即派员到新城乡调查，兹将调查结果报告如下：
    新城乡于一九五○年秋后，曾发放过一次烈属军属补助粮。当时领导方面对此事重视不够，干部又少，区里仅让一财经助理员办理。事先没有很好地向群众宣传优抚政策，也没有了解情况，便召开了一次烈属军属代表会，草率决定按人口分发：一等每人米二十四斤，二等每人米二十斤，三等每人米十六斤。当时该乡尚未进行土地改革，阶级界限不明确，同时乡干部内部也不纯洁，因而对于不需要补助的富农徐金瑞（烈属，六口人）也发给了补助粮一百二十斤；而贫苦孤寡军属高陈氏、徐梁氏、田李氏等，才领到补助粮几十斤。贵报读者批评中指出乡干部田志宇、田厚玉贪污了军属熊文治（贵报误写为熊文站）的补助粮，据了解，该二人确曾企图贪污，但被区政府发觉制止了。
    这次调查，已使我们彻底认识了过去忽视优抚工作所产生的严重恶果。这是我们责任心不强的具体表现。目前群众政治觉悟已大大提高，很多人将作好优抚代耕工作当做爱国的具体行动之一。我们今后当发动群众，进一步主动地帮助革命烈士家族和革命军人家属解决生产与生活上的困难，认真作好优抚工作。
                                        湖北省礼山县人民政府
