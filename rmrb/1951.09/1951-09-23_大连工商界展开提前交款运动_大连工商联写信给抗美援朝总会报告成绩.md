    Dalian Business Community Launches Advance Payment Campaign
    Dalian Federation of Industry and Commerce Writes to Resist America, Aid Korea General Association Reporting Achievements
    In order to oppose the United States' sabotage of the Kaesong talks and its separate peace treaty with Japan, the Dalian business community has launched a campaign to increase production, donate funds, and make advance payments. The Dalian Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Dalian Business Community Resist America, Aid Korea Committee wrote a letter to the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association on September 5, reporting the achievements of this campaign and challenging business communities across the country. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    To the Dalian Branch of the Liaoda City Resist America, Aid Korea Association, forwarded to the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association:
    In order to oppose the U.S. imperialists' shameless acts of sabotaging the Kaesong talks and pursuing a separate peace treaty with Japan, our Dalian business community has launched a campaign to increase production, donate funds, and make advance payments, so that donations for weapons can be sent to the front lines as soon as possible, to strengthen and consolidate national defense and strive for the early arrival of the final victory in Resist America, Aid Korea. As of September 5, the total amount of payments reached 6,755,273,880 yuan, successfully achieving our plan to prepay half of the donation for nine fighter planes. We are confident that we can overfulfill the entire donation plan by the end of October. We hereby use these conditions to challenge the Wuhan business community and launch a challenge competition to business communities across the country.
    Our donation campaign is being carried out under the guiding principle of increasing production and improving management. In industry, we have improved technology, tapped into the potential of production, and increased output. Taking the total output value in May as 100, it increased to 120 in June and 130 in July. In commerce, we have improved management, developed the exchange of local products, and implemented the principle of small profits and quick turnover, greatly increasing sales. Taking May as 100, it increased to 123 in June and 132 in July.
    In our campaign to increase production and donate funds, we have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism. Generally, we voluntarily proposed to donate 3% to 5% of the total sales amount and part of the profits, and some manufacturers voluntarily donated 30% to 50% of their annual profits.
    Through checking and revising patriotic covenants, we have included the plan for increasing production and donating funds as one of the main contents of the covenant, and we have established a long-term plan for preferential treatment work, helping the youth of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers' families to find employment, regularly donating goods and cash, writing letters of condolence, and expressing sympathy to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.
    Please convey our challenge conditions to business communities across the country.
    Dalian Federation of Industry and Commerce, Dalian Business Community Resist America, Aid Korea Committee

    大连工商界展开提前交款运动
    大连工商联写信给抗美援朝总会报告成绩
    大连工商界为了反对美国破坏开城谈判及单独对日媾和，展开了增产捐献提前交款运动。大连工商业联合会和大连工商界抗美援朝委员会，在九月五日给抗美援朝总会写了一封信，报告这个运动的成绩，并向全国各地工商界提出挑战。这封信的全文如下：旅大市抗美援朝分会转中国人民抗美援朝总会：
    为了反对美帝国主义破坏开城谈判及单独对日媾和的无耻行为，我们大连工商界掀起了增产捐献提前交款运动，把捐献武器早日送到前线，壮大与巩固国防力量，争取抗美援朝最后胜利的早日到来。截止九月五日，交款总额已达六、七五五、二七三、八八○元，胜利地实现了我们捐献九架战斗机提前交款半数的计划。并有信心争取到十月底超额完成全部捐献计划。我们谨以此条件，向武汉市工商界应战，并向全国工商界展开挑战竞赛。
    我们的捐献运动是在增加生产、改善经营的方针下开展起来的。工业方面，改进技术、发挥生产潜在力量，提高了生产。以五月份的生产总值作为一○○，六月份增至一二○，七月份增至一三○。商业方面，改善经营、发展土产交流、贯彻薄利多销的方针，销货额大大增加。以五月作为一○○，六月份增至一二三，七月份增至一三二。
    我们在增产捐献运动中，发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，一般的均自愿提出按销货总额的百分之三至百分之五及以利润的一部分捐献，有的厂商自动捐献全年盈利的百分之三○到百分之五○。
    我们通过检查与修订爱国公约，把增产捐献计划订为公约的主要内容之一，并订立了长期的优抚工作计划，帮助烈、军属青年就业，定期献实物及现款，写慰问信，慰问烈、军家属。
    请将我们的应战挑战条件，转达全国各地工商界。
    大连工商业联合会  大连工商界抗美援朝委员会
    一九五一年九月五日
