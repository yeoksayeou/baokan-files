Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 19th: The Iranian government, on September 12th, handed a note to Truman's special diplomatic advisor Harriman, who is currently in the United States, to be forwarded to the British government regarding the nationalization of Iranian oil. In the note, the Iranian government requested the British government to agree to resume negotiations on the oil issue based on the conditions proposed by the Iranian government; the note also stipulated that the British government must respond within fifteen days, otherwise, the Iranian government will expel the British technical personnel remaining in Abadan.

Commenting on this matter, an editorial in the Iranian newspaper "Bisui Ayandi" stated that Harriman and U.S. imperialism naturally would not object to using the Iranian government's note to exert pressure on its opponent, Britain. The newspaper believes that the Iranian government's method of forwarding the note to Britain through Harriman "violates the usual procedures of an independent country and damages the prestige of the Iranian nation." The newspaper said, "This shameless method of the Iranian government relying on the power of U.S. imperialism has aroused the indignation and loathing of the Iranian people." The newspaper concluded by pointing out that the Iranian people hope that the Iranian authorities and national public opinion will completely eliminate the imperialist forces of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The newspaper believes that if one imperialist agent is driven out by the power of another imperialist, the result will be that U.S. imperialists will replace British imperialist forces in all matters concerning Iranian oil.

    伊政府通过哈里曼照会英国
    提出恢复石油问题谈判条件
    伊报斥政府借助美国势力
    【新华社十九日讯】德黑兰消息：伊朗政府在本月十二日以关于伊朗石油国有化的照会一件，交给刻在美国的杜鲁门外交特别顾问哈里曼转交英国政府。伊朗政府在照会中要求英国政府同意以伊朗政府所提条件为基础恢复关于石油问题的谈判；照会并限定英国政府在十五日以内答复，否则，伊朗政府将把留在阿巴丹的英国技术人员驱逐出境。
    伊朗报纸“比苏·阿杨第报”的社论在评论这件事情时说：哈里曼和美帝国主义自然不反对利用伊朗政府的照会，向他的对手——英国施用压力。该报认为伊朗政府通过哈里曼转交照会给英国的办法，“违反了一个独立国家的通常的手续，损害了伊朗国家的威望”。该报说：“伊朗政府借助美帝国主义的势力的这种厚颜无耻的手法，已引起伊朗人民的义愤和憎恶的情绪。”该报最后指出：伊朗人民希望伊朗当局和全国舆论彻底消灭前英伊石油公司的帝国主义势力。该报认为：如果通过另一个帝国主义的势力赶走了一个帝国主义的代理人，结果就会是：美帝国主义者将在一切关于伊朗石油的事务上代替英帝国主义的势力。
