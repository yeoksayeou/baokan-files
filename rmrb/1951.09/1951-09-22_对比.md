    Chairman Mao is like the sun, bringing warmth and joy to the Chinese people. The Communist Party is like the spring breeze, blowing across the ancient land, making it vibrant and prosperous. In just two short years, not only has this old China been given a new look, but it has also been infused with new blood and new life. Those who have been oppressed for thousands of years have stood up to be masters, liberated from heavy shackles! The land is filled with songs, and the people are praising, praising the coming of the new era in unison—the coming of a happy and free new era.

    Those who have never climbed high mountains do not know the ease of galloping on flat ground; those who have never encountered storms do not know the ease of sailing on a calm sea. Those who have not suffered the persecution of the old society cannot know the joy of the liberated people. Therefore, we cheer for National Day from the bottom of our hearts, and we also sing praises of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, because they are the creators of happiness and the founders of the new China.

    In order to further appreciate this fruit of happiness, let me first recall the past: Before 1927, I also participated in the ranks of workers, and together with them, I planned how to get rid of a hand-to-mouth existence, but the result was failure, a cruel failure; in Kunming in 1941, I also personally rescued a female peasant hanging from a beam, but although I saved her life, the result was only to prolong her tragic life. I also protested for a sick soldier who had been flogged and fell to the side of the road, but the result, I fear, would be to send him to his death because of it. These experiences are still fresh in my memory. Fortunately, the Communist Party came and led us to destroy the corrupt and reactionary rule, enabling us to be reborn: workers are leading the whole country with boundless joy; farmers have been allocated land and become masters; soldiers are even more glorious, not only defenders of the motherland, but also the vanguards of the world's struggle for peace. Generally speaking, there is no longer dark rule in the country, and the people have become masters, no wonder songs are heard everywhere and cheers fill the city.

    These stark contrasts are part of my entire experience and also the driving force for me to move towards the light. But I firmly believe that the liberated workers, peasants, and soldiers will speak more earnestly and movingly, so after this simple narrative, I will turn to talk about ourselves—we who are engaged in scientific work. After liberation, we also have unspeakable joy and countless good times. We are no longer as lonely and suffocated as we were before liberation. We are organized, purposeful, mental workers working hard for national construction.

    What excites us the most is that our creations can be published and promoted. For example, the number of pages published by Acta Mathematica before liberation in fourteen or fifteen years, we can now exceed it in just one year thanks to the support of the government. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has published twenty-four kinds of specialized publications. This not only greatly improves the enthusiasm of scientific workers, but also gives full play to the enthusiasm of scientific workers in loving the people and loving the motherland. In the past, due to the semi-colonial society, coupled with the indifference of the Chiang regime, the elaborate structures of scientific workers were often sent abroad for publication, resulting in "semi-colonial" scientific research, relying on the breath of foreigners. Now we have our own fully broad garden. We are able to create our own schools of thought autonomously. Dedicate our work directly to our own people.

    What excited me most during the summer vacation was the founding conference of the Mathematical Society. This founding conference was not the first time. I remember that it was established once in Shanghai in 1936. At that time, with the size and talent of Beijing, only a teaching assistant-level representative attended—the author. In 1941, it was established again in Kunming. At that time, apart from Kunming, there was only one person from another province—Mr. Chen Jianguo from Zhejiang University. But the situation this year is completely different. From Northeast China to Guangdong and Guangxi, from the coast to Sichuan and Gansu, more than seventy representatives gathered together and became an unprecedented great unity in the national mathematics community. This was unimaginable in the era of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime. The most valuable thing is that the meeting showed unity, frankness, and sincerity, and no longer the old-fashioned small-circle infighting style. People still come from the old society, but what power has fundamentally transformed us? Undoubtedly, we must thank the Communist Party. Its leadership has subtly influenced us, making us move towards progress and light together.

    A series of conferences of specialized natural science societies were held during the summer vacation, and the Mathematical Society was only one of them. From what I know, the situations are similar. There is not one that does not sing the praises of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, because they have paved the way for our scientific workers, enabling us to embark on the road of serving the people and the motherland.

    There are too many things like this to count. Scientific workers, just from the standpoint of our own positions, we can't help but cheer loudly and praise wholeheartedly. Now it is only a short two years, and American imperialists are still pressing us hard, but our work has had such a good start, so we are deeply confident that our future is infinitely bright. When drinking water, remember the source. We have to thank our wise leaders. He has already led us onto the broad road. Therefore, when I celebrate this glorious day—the two-year National Day—I respectfully salute Chairman Mao and shout long live.

专栏：庆祝建国两周年

    毛泽东像太阳，他给中国人民带来温暖，带来欢欣。共产党像春风，他把整个的古老的大地吹拂得生气勃勃，欣欣向荣。短短的两年，不但已经把这旧中国换上了新装，而且注入了新血液，新生命。千百年来被压迫者已经翻身做主人，从重重的桎梏中解放出来！大地上布满了歌声，人民都在赞美，同声赞美新时代的降临——幸福的自由的新时代的降临。
    没有登过高山的，不知道平地的易于驰骋；没有遇过风暴的，不知道静海的易于航行。没有遭受过旧社会迫害的，不能知道解放出来的人们的欢欣。所以我们从心底里为国庆而欢呼，我们也要歌颂毛主席，赞美共产党，因为他们是幸福的创造者，是新中国的奠基人。
    为了更进一步地欣赏这幸福的果实，先让我来追述一下既往：一九二七年以前我也曾参加过工人行列，和他们共同计谋过如何摆脱朝不保夕的生涯，但结果是失败了，残酷地失败了；一九四一年在昆明，我也曾亲手解救过悬挂在屋梁上的女农民，虽然救得了她的命，而其结果不过是延长了她的悲惨的生命，我也曾为被鞭挞倒在路侧的病兵而抗议，但其结果诚恐是反会因此而送掉他的性命。这些体验，记忆犹新，幸亏来了共产党，领导我们摧毁了腐朽反动的统治，使我们再世为人：工人们在领导着全国，无限的欢欣；农民们，分到了土地翻身做了主人；士兵们更是光荣，不仅是祖国的保卫者，而且成为全世界争取和平的急先锋。全国说来，已经没有了黑暗的统治，人民都成了主人，无怪乎歌声遍野，欢呼盈城。
    这些强烈的对比，是我全部体验的一部分，也是我走向光明的动力。但我深信翻身后的工农兵一定会说得更恳切更动人，所以在这简单的叙述之后，转而谈到我们自己——我们这从事科学工作的一群。在解放后我们也有说不尽的欢欣，数不尽的好光景。我们再也不像解放前的那么孤寂，那么气闷。我们是有组织，有目的，为国家建设而努力的脑力劳动工人。
    我们最兴奋的是我们的创作得以刊布，得以推广。例如，解放前十四五年数学学报所刊行的页数，现在由于政府的支持，短短的一年我们就能超过了它。中国科学院刊印了二十四种专门刊物。这不但是大大地提高了科学工作者的积极性，而且发挥了科学工作者爱人民爱祖国的热诚。过去由于半殖民地式的社会，加之蒋政权对这些漠不关心，致使科学工作者的精心结构，常常寄往国外发表，以致造成了“半殖民地式”的科学研究，仰给于洋人鼻息的科学研究。而现在我们有了自己的充分宽广的园地。我们已能自主地造成我们的学派。把我们的工作直接地献给自己的人民。
    在暑假中最使我激动的，就是数学会的成立大会。这次的成立会已经不是第一次。我记得在一九三六年曾经在上海成立过一次，那时以北京之大，人才之众，仅仅出席了一位助教级的代表——就是作者。一九四一年又在昆明成立过一次，那时除掉昆明以外，仅有一位来自外埠的人——浙江大学陈建功先生。而今年的情况迥然不同了，从东北到两广，从沿海到川陇，共有七十多位代表欢聚一堂，成了全国数学界的空前未有的大团结。这是蒋匪政权时代所梦想不到的。最可贵的是会议中所表现的是团结一致，坦白诚恳，而不再是旧时代的小圈子的勾心斗角的作风。人还是旧社会来的，但什么力量使我们有了根本的转变？无疑地我们要感谢共产党，它的领导使我们潜移默化了，使我们同趋进步，同向光明。
    暑假中开了一连串的自然科学专门学会的会议，而数学会仅是其中的一个。据我所知道的情况都是相仿佛。没有一个不歌颂毛主席，不赞美共产党，因为他为我们科学工作者铺好了道路，使我们走上了为人民为祖国的道路。
    诸如此类的事情，就不可胜数。我们科学工作者仅就我们自己岗位的立场，我们也就不由自主地高声欢呼，尽情赞美。现在还不过是短短的两周年，同时美帝国主义者还在紧逼着我们，但我们的工作就有了如此良好的开端，所以我们深深自信，我们的前途是无限光明。饮水思源，我们不得不感激我们的贤明的领导者。他已经领导着我们走上了康庄大道。所以在我庆祝这光荣的日子——二周年的国庆——的时候，谨向毛主席致以最高的敬礼，并高呼万岁。
