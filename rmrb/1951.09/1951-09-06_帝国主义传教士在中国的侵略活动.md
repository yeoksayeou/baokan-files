    Imperialist Missionaries' Aggressive Activities in China
    Recently, various localities have continuously discovered and cracked down on counter-revolutionary political cases involving churches. According to incomplete statistics, there are 38 significant cases, including the Guandong Meixian Catholic Church espionage case, the Tianjin Catholic Church espionage case, and the Qingdao Gu Ren'en special agent case.

    These cases fully expose the criminal facts of imperialism using religion to invade China. The main criminals in these cases are almost all veteran spy elements who have been engaged in espionage and sabotage activities in China for decades. For example, the Catholic Bishop of Meixian, Guangdong, Ford, delivered military intelligence about the Northern Expeditionary Army to the American Vice Consul in Shantou, Bland, during the First Domestic Revolutionary War; during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, he collected military intelligence about the Red Army for the American Consul in Shantou, Smith; during the Anti-Japanese War, he collected economic intelligence about South China for the American government and supplied military maps and intelligence to the invading Japanese army; during the Liberation War, he drafted the so-called "Solution to the Communist Rebellion in Guangdong Province" for the bandit Song Ziwen. These imperialist agents in religious clothing have long interfered with and controlled China's internal affairs. For example, the American pastor Bi Fanyu once drafted a secret "Social Education Plan" with the U.S. Army Colonel Shreeve stationed in China in 1946 for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. He boasted that once this plan was implemented, it would break the Chinese people's belief in the Communist Party. They frantically carried out anti-communist and anti-people activities. Li Peili, who has been declared expelled by the People's Government, openly supported the Chiang bandit gang's shameful civil war in the capacity of "Envoy of the Holy See to China." In the espionage case of the Xianxian Catholic Church in Hebei, which we cracked in 1947, the main culprit Shang Jianxun (French priest), etc., constantly probed for intelligence in our liberated areas and supplied it to the bandit Sun Lianzhong and the U.S. Strategic Intelligence Office. This group of missionaries even openly organized reactionary armed forces and directly fought against the Chinese people. The notorious international agent Lei Mingyuan, disguised as a priest, successively organized the "North China Battlefield People's Service Corps" and the "Southern Hebei Communist Suppression Army" to harass our liberated areas. Another Belgian priest and international agent, Lei Zhenyuan, organized the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" special agent force, which, in April and May 1948, cooperated with the Chiang bandit army in invading our Central Hebei liberated area. Naturally, their only result was annihilation by the Chinese people.

    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this group of imperialist missionaries harbored great hatred for the new regime and painstakingly tried to sabotage it. They called the People's Government "devils" and vowed to "crush the heads of the devils."

    In order to achieve this goal, imperialist missionaries spread rumors everywhere, published a large number of reactionary books and periodicals, slandered the Communist Party and the People's Government, and alienated the relationship between believers and the People's Government. The upper-level imperialist elements of Catholicism repeatedly issued formal orders, instructing believers to refuse to cooperate with the government.

    In order to achieve this goal, imperialist missionaries established or developed reactionary organizations within the church as the core for carrying out sabotage activities. For example, the imperialist elements in Catholicism, under the leadership of Li Peili, organized and developed the "Legion of Mary" in many cities, which has been fully proven to be a secret counter-revolutionary organization.

    In order to achieve this goal, imperialist missionaries intensified their espionage activities. For example, in the American espionage case in Tianjin, which was cracked in April this year, one of the main culprits, the French priest Bu Xiangxian, was originally a fugitive from the Xianxian Catholic Church espionage case, but after the liberation of Tianjin, he remained unrepentant and continued to collect strategic intelligence for U.S. imperialism, probing how wide and large an airport in a certain place was and whether it could land B-29 aircraft; instructing his confidants to infiltrate our factories and institutions to probe for intelligence; and carrying out other sabotage activities.

    In order to achieve this goal, imperialist missionaries attempted to use terrorist means to organize or participate in armed riots. For example, Catholic priest Ma Di'nuo (Italian) actively participated in the armed riot plot to bombard Tiananmen Square. Our public security organs searched his residence and found a large number of weapons and reactionary criminal evidence. Also, not long ago, the Catholic priest Man Jishi (Dutch) in Tianjin and others organized a counter-revolutionary secret alliance, plotting to assassinate patriotic Catholics and create terrorist incidents.

    In order to achieve this goal, imperialist missionaries actively sabotaged the policies and decrees of our People's Government. For example, Yu Wenxi (Belgian), a priest of the Jingzhou Catholic Church in Hubei, openly resisted our Land Reform Law and detained his tenant representatives Hu Dinglu and Luo Shibaobao in the church, threatening them not to participate in land reform. Also, Man Jishi and Fang Ruhui, Catholic priests in Tianjin, incited believers to undermine our Marriage Law, nonsense that implementing the Marriage Law "is destroying families."

    In order to achieve this goal, imperialist missionaries actively sabotaged the patriotic movement of the Chinese people and believers. They slandered the just action of the Chinese people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and raised the banner of "Resisting the Devil and Aiding the Spirit" to undermine the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. They have done everything possible to sabotage the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of Chinese believers. They threatened believers, saying that self-reliance and reform are "apostasy" and "will go to hell"; they deceived believers, saying that the church has already implemented the Three-Self, so why should there be a Three-Self Movement; they tempted believers, saying: Don't engage in the Three-Self, the Americans will give you money.

    The sabotage activities of imperialist missionaries against New China are instigated and supported by U.S. imperialism. In addition to directly leading them, U.S. imperialism also directs them through the Vatican or the governments of its vassal states. These vassal states of the United States actively encourage their missionaries to serve U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against New China. Wen Guibin, the former French bishop of the Tianjin Catholic Church, and other French priests and nuns, who were expelled by our country at the end of May this year, were summoned by French Foreign Minister Schuman after returning to France because of their "meritorious" service in invading China, and were awarded the "National Cross Medal" and the "Knight's Cross" by the French government. This example fully illustrates that imperialist missionaries are the executors of imperialist aggression policies in China.

    This group of "wolves in sheep's clothing" has been rampant in China for decades. Successive reactionary governments never dared to touch a hair of them, but instead flattered them. Therefore, they were extremely arrogant in bullying the Chinese people. After liberation, they still thought that the Chinese people would not dare to touch them and could let them run wild, so they still carried out sabotage activities unscrupulously. But they were completely wrong. The Chinese people who have stood up will never allow this group of wolves to do evil again.

### 帝国主义传教士在中国的侵略活动

    帝国主义传教士在中国的侵略活动
    近来各地不断地发现和破获教会的反革命政治案件，据不完整的统计，比较重大的就有广东梅县天主教堂间谍案、天津天主教间谍案、青岛顾仁恩特务案等三十八件。
    这些案件充分暴露了帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国的罪恶事实。这些案件中的主要罪犯，几乎都是在中国进行了数十年间谍破坏活动的老牌间谍分子。例如天主教广东梅县主教福尔德，在第一次国内革命战争时期，他曾给美国驻汕头副领事柏兰递送北伐军的军事情报；在第二次国内革命战争时期，他曾替汕头美国领事斯密斯搜集红军的军事情报；在抗日战争期间，他曾给美国政府搜集华南的经济情报，并将军用地图和情报供给日本侵略军；在解放战争期间，他曾替宋匪子文草拟所谓“广东省共乱解决办法”。这些披着宗教外衣的帝国主义代理人，曾经长期地干涉和控制中国内政。例如美国牧师毕范宇曾经在一九四六年和美国驻华的陆军上校史瑞夫共同为蒋介石匪帮草拟了一个秘密的“社会教育计划”，他自诩这个计划实现后，即可打破中国人民对共产党的信仰。他们疯狂地进行反共反人民的活动。已被人民政府宣布驱逐出境的黎培里，就曾以“教廷驻华公使”的身份，公开支持蒋匪帮的可耻内战。一九四七年被我破获的河北献县天主堂间谍案，主犯尚建勋（法籍神父）等曾不断刺探我解放区的情报，供给孙匪连仲和美国战略情报处。这批传教士更公然组织反动武装，直接与中国人民作战。披着神父外衣的恶名昭著的国际特务雷鸣远，曾先后组织“华北战地民众服务团”、“冀南剿共军”，骚扰我解放区。另一个比籍神父、国际特务雷震远组织了“公教青年报国团”的特务武装，在一九四八年四、五月间，配合蒋匪军进犯我冀中解放区。自然，他们唯一的结果是被中国人民歼灭。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，这批帝国主义传教士对这个新政权怀着极大的仇视，处心积虑地要加以破坏。他们把人民政府称做“魔鬼”，发誓要“踏碎魔鬼的头颅”。
    为了达到这个目的，帝国主义传教士到处散布谣言，出版大量的反动书刊，污蔑共产党和人民政府，离间教徒与人民政府的关系。天主教的上层帝国主义分子就曾屡次地发布正式命令，指使教徒拒绝与政府合作。
    为了达到这个目的，帝国主义传教士在教会内建立或发展了反动组织，作为进行破坏活动的核心。例如天主教中的帝国主义分子在黎培里的领导下，在不少城市中组织和发展了“圣母军”，它已被充分证明是秘密的反革命组织。
    为了达到这个目的，帝国主义传教士更加紧了间谍活动。例如今年四月间破获的天津美国间谍案，主犯之一的法籍神父卜相贤，本是献县天主堂间谍案中的逃犯，但他在天津解放以后仍怙恶不悛，继续为美帝国主义搜集战略情报，刺探某地飞机场有多宽多大，能否降落B—29型飞机；指示其亲信打入我工厂、机关刺探情报；并进行其他的破坏活动。
    为了达到这个目的，帝国主义传教士企图使用恐怖手段，组织或参加武装暴动。例如天主教神父马迪懦（意籍）积极地参加了阴谋炮轰天安门的武装暴动，我公安机关在他住宅搜查出大批武器和反动罪证。又如不久以前，天津的天主教神父满济世（荷籍）等组织了反革命的秘密结盟，阴谋暗杀爱国天主教徒，制造恐怖事件。
    为了达到这个目的，帝国主义传教士积极地破坏我人民政府的政策法令。例如湖北荆州天主堂神父余文锡（比籍）公然抗拒我土地改革法，并将他的佃户代表胡定禄、罗士保等扣押于教堂内，威胁他们不准参加土地改革。又如天津的天主教神父满济世、房如晦等煽动教徒破坏我婚姻法，胡说执行婚姻法“便是破坏家庭”。
    为了达到这个目的，帝国主义传教士积极地破坏中国人民和教徒的爱国运动。他们诬蔑中国人民抗美援朝的正义行动，并且打出“抗魔援灵”的旗号来破坏抗美援朝运动。他们对中国教徒的三自革新运动更是百般破坏。他们威吓教徒说：自立革新便是“背教”，“要下地狱”；他们欺骗教徒说：教会本来就实行三自了，何必还要有三自运动；他们利诱教徒说：你们不要搞三自，美国人会给你们钱。
    帝国主义传教士对新中国的破坏活动，是受美帝国主义的指使和支持的。美帝国主义除了直接领导他们以外，并通过它所控制的梵蒂冈或它的附庸国家的政府指挥他们。这些美国的附庸国家积极地鼓励它们的传教士为美帝国主义对新中国的侵略政策服务。今年五月底被我驱逐出境的前天津天主教法籍主教文贵宾和别的法籍神父、修女，在回到法国以后，因为侵略中国有“功”，被法国政府外交部长舒曼召见，并得到法国政府颁给他们的“国家十字勋章”和“骑士十字章”。这个例子充分说明了帝国主义传教士是帝国主义侵略政策的在中国的执行人。
    这批“披着羊皮的狼”在中国已横行了几十年，历届的反动政府从不敢动他们一根毛，反而阿谀奉承他们，因此他们对中国人民作威作福达到了极端狂妄的程度。在解放以后，他们还是以为中国人民不敢触动他们，可以任他们横行霸道，因此他们仍是肆无忌惮地进行着破坏活动。但是他们完全弄错了，站起来了的中国人民决不能再让这群恶狼为非作歹。  （新华社）
