    Firmly Oppose the United States' Separate Peace Treaty with Japan and Arming of Japan,
    Intensify the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, and Thoroughly Defeat American Imperialism!
    The sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan has arrived.
    Six years ago today, the vicious Japanese imperialism was forced to lay down its weapons. This was a great victory for the Chinese people's long-term anti-fascist armed struggle, and a great victory for the international democratic struggle. The achievement of this victory is inseparable from the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and inseparable from the internationalist and selfless assistance of the great friendly country, the Soviet Union. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, adhered to the correct political line, and with a spirit of relentless courage and dauntless persistence, repelled the frantic attacks of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Finally, due to the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to Northeast China, annihilating one million Japanese Kwantung Army troops with overwhelming force, the Japanese fascist aggressors were forced to surrender unconditionally. Therefore, as we commemorate the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan today, we must first pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, pay tribute to the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, and pay tribute to the countless heroes who shed blood, sacrificed, and fought bravely on the battlefield and in various struggles!
    It is the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance. Six years ago today, although Japanese imperialism fell, the American aggressors, a hundred times more ferocious than Japanese imperialism, replaced Japanese imperialism, replacing the fascist bandits such as Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, rampaging around the world, disrupting the peaceful order of the world's people. For six years, American imperialism has exclusively controlled the authority over Japan, fostered Japanese fascist elements, revived Japanese militarism, maintained the Emperor system, created puppet regimes, and recently has been actively engaged in the heinous activities of a separate peace treaty with Japan and arming Japan, attempting to use Japan as a military base for launching aggressive wars, and driving the Japanese people into the abyss of disaster and destruction. After the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, directly fostered by American imperialism, suffered a crushing defeat by the Chinese people and disintegrated, in order to salvage its irreversible failure, it even launched a war of aggression against Korea, and occupied our territory of Taiwan, bombing our Northeast and coastal areas, killing peaceful residents. After the American imperialists were battered and bloodied in Korea by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they used conspiracies and tricks during the armistice negotiations, taking advantage of the negotiation break to carry out vicious murders against our delegation. We lodge a serious protest against this shameful and barbaric act of American imperialism's persistence in aggression and unreasonable behavior.
    On September 4th, the United States will convene the so-called San Francisco Conference, preparing to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan based on the one-sided draft peace treaty with Japan announced by the US and British governments. In order to achieve its unilaterally arranged illegal conference and illegal treaty, American imperialism excluded the People's Republic of China, which fought against Japan for the longest time, sacrificed the most, and contributed the most, from this conference. Everyone knows that the so-called draft peace treaty with Japan manufactured by American imperialism is no less than a declaration of war against the Chinese people and the people of the world, and no less than chaining the Japanese people to the American war machine, causing the Japanese people to suffer even greater catastrophes. Therefore, as we commemorate the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan today, all of us Chinese people must do everything possible to smash the criminal activities of American imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan, resolutely oppose the illegal peace treaty with Japan unilaterally arranged by American imperialism, and resolutely oppose the illegal San Francisco Conference and all its resolutions. We must unite the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries, unite the people of all countries that participated in the war against Japan, and strive to sign a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan.
    Before Japan's surrender, we members of the September 3rd Society had engaged in struggles against imperialism and against the Kuomintang fascist dictatorship under various names and in various ways. On September 3, 1945, in order to commemorate the great victory of the Chinese people and the world people's anti-fascist democratic struggle, we gloriously changed our name to the September 3rd Society. Today, we warmly celebrate the "September 3rd" anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In addition to joy and excitement, we recall the crimes committed by American imperialism in various parts of the world over the past six years, and that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have defeated Japanese imperialism, American aggressors and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the new China has achieved true independence, freedom, and is moving towards prosperity, stability, prosperity and happiness. We are full of confidence in the victory over imperialist aggression for the future of China and the world. We members of the September 3rd Society must unite with the broad masses of people in the cultural, educational, scientific and technological fields on the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, intensify the sacred struggle to Resist America, Aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, strengthen national defense construction and political, economic, and cultural construction, and expand and consolidate the people's democratic united front; we must resolutely stand on the side of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries, strengthen and consolidate the fraternal friendship between the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union, thoroughly defeat the American imperialist aggressors and robbers, and defend the security of the motherland and the lasting peace of the world.
    Long live the victory of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist struggle!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    我们应怎样纪念“九三”
    许德珩
    坚决反对美国单独对日媾和及武装日本，
    加紧抗美援朝运动，澈底打败美帝国主义！
    抗日战争胜利六周年纪念日到来了。
    六年前的今天，穷凶极恶的日本帝国主义被迫放下了它的武器。这是中国人民反法西斯的长期武装斗争的伟大胜利，是国际民主斗争的伟大胜利。这个胜利的获得，是和中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确的领导分不开的，是和伟大的友邦苏联的国际主义的无私的援助分不开的。在八年抗日战争中，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下坚持了正确的政治路线，以前仆后继、不屈不挠的精神打退了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的疯狂的进攻，最后由于苏联出兵东北，以雷霆万钧之力歼灭了一百万日寇关东军，迫使日本法西斯侵略者无条件投降。因此，当我们纪念抗日战争胜利六周年的今天，我们首先要向中国共产党和毛主席致敬，向伟大的友邦苏联致敬，向在战场上，在各种斗争中流血牺牲、英勇战斗的无数的英雄们致敬！
    抗战胜利六周年了。六年前的今天，日本帝国主义虽然倒下去了，可是比日本帝国主义更凶恶百倍的美国侵略者竟代替了日本帝国主义，代替了希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机等法西斯匪徒，在世界各处横冲直撞，扰乱世界人民的和平秩序。六年以来，美帝国主义一手独揽了对日管制大权，扶植日本法西斯分子，复活日本军国主义，保持天皇制度，制造傀儡政权，最近更积极进行单独对日媾和及武装日本的罪恶活动，妄图利用日本为其发动侵略战争的军事基地，驱使日本人民走向灾难和毁灭的深渊。美帝国主义在其直接扶植的国民党蒋匪帮遭受中国人民的痛击而土崩瓦解之后，为欲挽救它永远不能挽救的失败，竟又发动侵朝战争，并霸占我国领土台湾，轰炸我东北和沿海一带和平居民。美帝在朝鲜被朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军打得头破血流之后，在停战谈判中，竟使用阴谋诡计，利用此谈判的间隙对我代表团进行恶毒的谋杀。我们对于美帝国主义这种坚持侵略、横蛮无理的可耻暴行，提出严重的抗议。
    九月四日美国将召集所谓旧金山会议，准备根据美英两国政府公布的片面的对日和约草案，签订单独对日和约。美帝国主义为了达到它一手包办的非法的和会与非法的和约，竟把对日作战最久、牺牲最大、贡献最多的中华人民共和国排斥于这个和会之外。尽人皆知，美帝国主义制造的所谓对日和约草案不啻是向中国人民和全世界人民的宣战书，不啻把日本人民拴在美国的战车上，使日本人民重罹更大的浩劫。因此，当我们纪念抗日战争胜利六周年的今天，我们全中国的人民，必须以全力粉碎美帝国主义单独对日媾和的罪恶活动，坚决反对美帝国主义一手包办的非法的对日和约，坚决反对非法的旧金山会议及一切决议。我们要联合日本人民和亚洲各国的人民，联合一切曾经参加对日作战国家的人民，争取签订全面的、公正的对日和约。
    我们九三学社的同人，在日本投降以前，曾以各种不同的名义和方式进行过反帝国主义、反国民党法西斯独裁统治的斗争。一九四五年九月三日，我们为纪念中国人民和世界人民反法西斯的民主斗争的伟大胜利，很光荣地改称九三学社。今天，我们热烈庆祝“九三”抗日战争胜利纪念日，我们于欢欣鼓舞之余，回想这六年来美帝国主义在世界各处所造成的罪恶，而中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，战胜了日本帝国主义、美国侵略者及其走狗蒋匪帮，新生的中国实现了真正的独立、自由、而且正走向富强、安定、繁荣和幸福的途径，我们对于中国和世界的前途充满了战胜帝国主义侵略的信心。我们九三学社的社员在抗日战争胜利六周年纪念的今天，一定要和广大的文教科学界人士团结起来，加紧抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣斗争，加强国防建设和政治、经济、文化建设，扩大和巩固人民民主统一战线；我们一定要坚决地站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营方面，加强中苏及一切爱好和平国家的人民的团结，加强和巩固中苏两大国家的兄弟般的友谊，澈底打败美帝国主义侵略强盗，保卫祖国的安全和世界的持久和平。
    中国人民反帝斗争胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
