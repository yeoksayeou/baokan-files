Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: TASS, September 12th, reported: According to the Japanese newspaper "Metal Worker", the Japan-China Friendship Association held a conference in Tokyo on August 31st. More than 200 people attended, including members of the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Socialist Party, representatives of Chinese and Korean overseas Chinese, representatives of social organizations and trade union groups, intellectuals, and general business owners. The conference passed a resolution stating: Because the People's Republic of China did not participate, the San Francisco Conference cannot be considered a legitimate peace conference.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: The Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on September 12th on the issue of the United States illegally signing a separate peace treaty with Japan. The commentary pointed out: The convocation of the San Francisco Conference by the US imperialists is a violation of international agreements. The so-called peace treaty with Japan signed by the United States is a war treaty, the purpose of which is to turn Japan into a military base for US imperialism in the Far East.

The commentary concluded by supporting the Soviet Union's attitude on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. The commentary stated: The Soviet Union's attitude on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan is in line with the interests of the people of Asian countries that were once invaded by Japanese fascism. Therefore, it has received enthusiastic support from all progressive humanity, and the Vietnamese people support this attitude of the Soviet Union.

    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社十二日讯：据日本报纸“金属劳动者”讯：日中友好协会于八月三十一日在东京召开大会，出席者有共产党、劳农党和社会党的议员，中国和朝鲜侨民代表，社会团体和工会团体代表，知识分子以及一般企业主等二百余人。大会通过决议说：由于没有中华人民共和国参加，旧金山会议不能认为是合法的和会。
    【新华社十三日讯】越南通讯社十二日就美国非法签订单独对日和约问题发表评论。评论指出：美帝国主义者召开旧金山会议，是违反国际协定的。美国所签订的所谓对日和约，是一个战争条约，其目的在使日本变成美帝国主义在远东的军事基地。
    评论最后支持苏联在对日和约问题上所采取的态度。评论称：苏联在对日和约问题上的态度，符合于曾经被日本法西斯侵入的亚洲各国人民的利益。因此得到全体进步人类的热烈支持，越南人民支持苏联的这种态度。
