Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, dispatch from TASS, San Francisco: The San Francisco conference closed on September 8th after the so-called "peace treaty" with Japan was signed.

The vast majority of countries that signed the US-British draft treaty with Japan were those that did not actually participate in the war against Japan, and they are thousands of kilometers away from Japan.

The delegations from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia did not attend the signing ceremony, and they absolutely rejected the US-made treaty because it is not a peace treaty but a treaty preparing for war.

Everyone knows that none of the major Asian powers participated in the signing of the San Francisco Treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, dispatch from TASS, San Francisco: Soviet representative Gromyko held a press conference here on September 8th. In front of 300 reporters, he issued a statement on the US-British draft treaty with Japan.

Gromyko said: This draft cannot serve as the basis for genuine peace in the Far East. A genuine peace should not allow Japanese militarism to raise its head, should guarantee the peace and security of Asian and Far Eastern countries, should satisfy the legitimate demands of the people who have suffered from Japanese aggression, and should also guarantee the restoration of Japan's sovereignty and independence.

Gromyko pointed out that all countries that violate international agreements and impose a separate treaty on Japan should be responsible to the entire world.

    苏波捷拒绝签署美制和约
    葛罗米柯声明美制和约不能作为远东真正媾和基础，所有违反国际协定国家，都应对全世界负责。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社旧金山九日电：旧金山会议于九月八日在所谓对日“和约”签字后闭幕。
    在美英对日和约草案上签字的绝大多数国家是实际并没有参加对日战争的，它们离日本有好几千公里的路程。
    苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团没有出席签字的仪式，它们绝对拒绝美制条约。因为那不是和平条约，而是准备战争的条约。
    大家都知道，亚洲的大国没有一个参加旧金山条约的签字。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社旧金山九日电：苏联代表葛罗米柯于九月八日在此间举行招待记者会。他在三百名记者面前发表了对于美英对日和约草案的声明。
    葛罗米柯说：这个草案不能作为远东真正媾和的基础，真正的媾和应当不容许日本军国主义抬头，保证亚洲与远东各国的和平与安全，满足曾受日本侵略之害的人民的正当要求，同时并保证日本的主权与独立得以恢复。
    葛罗米柯指出：所有违反国际协定把单独和约强加于日本的国家，都应对全世界负责。
