    Hangzhou Tiandetang Capitalist Beats Apprentice to Death Case:
    Perpetrator Chen Huazhou Sentenced to Death

To the Editor:
    The People's Daily "Reader's Letters" column on August 29th published a letter titled "Hangzhou Tiandetang Capitalist Beats Apprentice to Death." The feudal and barbaric behavior of Chen Huazhou, the junior owner of Tiandetang, in abusing and killing workers is absolutely not allowed to exist in the New China. The Hangzhou Municipal People's Court has already made a judgment on this case on August 24th. The perpetrator Chen Huazhou was sentenced to death. Chen Shaowu, the owner of Tiandetang, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for consistently mistreating workers, evading national taxes, and allowing his son to commit violence. He is also responsible for all medical and funeral expenses of the deceased, as well as 10 million yuan in consolation money for the deceased's mother, Zhu Shi Xiaozhao. This is a serious warning to those illegal capitalists who still mistreat workers with feudal behavior today.

    The Hangzhou Municipal People's Court held a trial for this case on the morning of August 24th. Representatives from the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Industry and Commerce attended as jurors. More than 2,000 workers from various trade unions in Hangzhou and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors attended as observers. After Liu Qi, Director of the Jianggan Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, initiated the public prosecution, the judge began the interrogation. Zhu Shi Xiaozhao, the family member of the deceased, recounted the circumstances of Zhu Zheng Sheng's murder and the past mistreatment by the capitalist, requesting the People's Government to avenge her son. Witness Zhang Ruikun and others testified in court to the fact that Chen Huazhou beat Zhu Zheng Sheng to death. The defendants Chen Huazhou and Chen Shaowu also admitted their criminal acts.

    Representatives of the audience, Yang Bingsheng and Huang Chucai, delivered their opinions successively after the interrogation. They unanimously believed that Chen Huazhou's act of beating Zhu Zheng Sheng to death was an illegal act that seriously infringed upon human rights and harmed the interests of the working class, and must be punished by national laws. Huang Chucai, the representative of the industrial and commercial sector, also stated that the incident of Chen Huazhou beating Zhu Zheng Sheng to death was a disgrace to the industrial and commercial sector. The industrial and commercial sector should strengthen its study of labor policies and laws, correct its attitude towards workers, thoroughly eliminate feudal mistreatment, and launch a resolute struggle against illegal capitalists like Chen Huazhou. Presiding Judge Liu Jiqing read out the verdict in court, and the trial concluded.

    After listening to the trial or the broadcast of the verdict, people from all walks of life in Hangzhou unanimously supported the People's Government's correct measures to safeguard the interests of the working class. Zhu Shi Xiaozhao, the family member of the deceased, said with emotion: "Before liberation, my son suffered so much abuse, and I didn't dare to say a word. Today, the People's Government has severely punished the murderer who beat my son to death according to the law, and I am truly grateful." Many people wrote letters to the Zhejiang Daily to support the judgment of the People's Court. Yu Xiuzhang, Chairman of the Hangzhou National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, said in a letter to the Zhejiang Daily: "It is hoped that all members of the national pharmaceutical industry and the city's industrial and commercial operators will take the Zhu Zheng Sheng murder incident as a profound lesson, eliminate feudal ideas and behaviors of mistreating workers, rely on the working class to jointly improve business, and prevent similar incidents from happening again."

    杭州天德堂资方打死学徒案
    凶犯陈华洲已被判死刑编辑同志：
    八月二十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载了“杭州天德堂资方打死学徒”的来信。天德堂小老板陈华洲这种虐杀工人的封建野蛮行为，在新中国是决不允许其存在的。杭州市人民法院已在八月二十四日对此案作出判决。凶犯陈华洲被判处死刑；天德堂老板陈绍武一贯虐待工人，偷逃国税、纵子行凶，判有期徒刑五年，并负担死者全部医药费、丧葬费及死者的母亲朱施晓照抚恤费一千万元。这对那些在今天仍旧以封建行为虐待工人的不法资方是一个严重的警告。
    杭州市人民法院在八月二十四日上午开庭审判这个案件。审判时，由杭州市总工会及工商联合会等机关的代表出席陪审，杭州市各业工会工人及工商界代表二千余人出席旁听。杭州市公安局江干分局刘琦局长提起公诉后，由审判员开始审讯。死者家属朱施晓照申诉了朱正生被害经过及过去受资方虐待情况，要求人民政府替她儿子报仇。证明人张瑞坤等当庭证明陈华洲打死朱正生的事实。被告陈华洲、陈绍武也承认了他们的犯罪事实。
    旁听人代表杨炳生和黄楚材在审讯后先后发表意见。他们一致认为陈华洲打死朱正生是严重侵犯人权、损害工人阶级利益的非法行为，必须受到国家法令的惩处。工商界代表黄楚材并表示：陈华洲打死朱正生事件是工商界的耻辱。工商界应加强学习劳动政策法令，端正对工人的态度，澈底消除封建虐待行为，并向类似陈华洲的不法资方展开坚决斗争。审判长刘季青当庭宣读了判决书，审判即告结束。
    杭州市各阶层人士旁听了审判或收听了宣判广播以后，一致拥护人民政府维护工人阶级利益的正确措施。死者家属朱施晓照感动地说：“解放前，我儿子受了多少虐待，我一句话也不敢说。今天，人民政府依法严办了打死我儿子的凶手，我真万分感谢。”很多人写信给浙江日报拥护人民法院的判决。杭州市国药业公会主任委员俞绣章在致浙江日报的信中说：“希望国药业全体同业会员和全市工商业者，把朱正生被害事件引为深刻教训，肃清虐待工人的封建思想行为，依靠工人阶级共同搞好营业，不准再有类似事件发生。”  竺刚宝
