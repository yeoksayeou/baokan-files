    Attention Should Be Paid to the Ideological Content of Film "Advertisements" and "Descriptions"

    To the Editor:
    Film is one of the important weapons of literary and artistic propaganda. In order to expand its propaganda role and educate a wider audience, it is absolutely necessary to have advertisements, pictures, and descriptions introducing good films. However, our purpose in promoting and recommending a film should not be simply from a "commercial point of view"; we should not only attract the audience's attention but also try our best to use these promotions to educate the masses, or at least allow the audience to correctly understand the content of the film being promoted. Therefore, I believe that some of the film advertisements for "The Brave People" recently published in Shanghai and Beijing newspapers are inappropriately worded. It is true that "The Brave People" is very "thrilling," "intense," and "suspenseful," and there are scenes such as "flying horses chasing cars," but if we set aside its ideological and political significance and only emphasize some of these phenomena, it would be extremely vulgar and wrong. "The Brave People" aims to allow us to recognize and learn the spirit of Soviet patriotism through its vivid and specific stories and plots; it is not about creating some "thrilling," "intense," and "suspenseful" (of course, these words themselves do not have any bad meaning) "scenes" and "plots" for the audience to "appreciate." To add this kind of "legendary" and "martial arts" style of promotion to a film that is originally rich in educational significance, I believe, not only distorts the content of the film but also gives the audience a bad influence invisibly. This is exactly the "propaganda" method of the bourgeois newspapers. I suggest that future film propaganda should be truthful and contain political content; at the same time, the editorial departments of newspapers should also pay attention to the content of advertisements.

### 应注意电影“广告”和“说明”的思想内容

    应注意电影“广告”和“说明”的思想内容编辑同志：
    电影是重要的文艺宣传武器之一。为了要扩大宣传作用，教育更广大的观众，对于介绍好影片的广告、图片和说明是完全必要的。但是，我们宣传和推荐一张影片的目的不应单纯地从“商业观点”出发；不仅要引起观众的注意，而且更应该尽量利用这些宣传对群众起教育作用，至少也应该让观众能正确地了解到被宣传的影片的内容。因此，我认为最近在上海、北京报纸上刊登的“勇敢的人”的某些电影广告，里面的措辞是不恰当的。“勇敢的人”里固然很“惊险”、“热烈”和“紧张”，也有“飞马追车”等镜头，如果我们撇开它的思想性和政治意义，而只着重地强调其中的一些现象，那就是极其庸俗和错误的了。“勇敢的人”是要通过它生动具体的故事和情节，让我们去认识和学习苏维埃人民爱国主义的精神；并不是要制造些“惊险”、“热烈”、“紧张”（当然这些字面本身并没有什么不好的意义）的“场面”与“情节”，来供观众“欣赏”。对一部本来富有教育意义的影片，加上这种“传奇”、“武侠”式的宣传，我认为不但歪曲了影片的内容，无形中也给了观众不良的影响。这正是资产阶级报纸的“宣传”方式。我建议今后的电影宣传应作到真实，有政治内容；同时，报纸的编辑部门也应重视广告的内容。
