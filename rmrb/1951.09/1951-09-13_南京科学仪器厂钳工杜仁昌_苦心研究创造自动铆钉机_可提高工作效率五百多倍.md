Nanjing Scientific Instrument Factory Fitter Du Renchang
Painstakingly Researches and Creates Automatic Riveting Machine
Can Increase Work Efficiency More Than 500 Times
    Du Renchang, a fitter at the Nanjing State-owned Scientific Instrument Factory, has successfully created an automatic riveting machine, increasing the efficiency of rivet production by more than 500 times. The factory mainly produces Popular Science slide projectors, which use many rivets. In the past, making one rivet on a regular lathe took 8 minutes and 24 seconds, and even on a hexagonal lathe, it took 3 minutes and 25 seconds. As a result, the output of rivets sometimes could not keep up with the needs of other parts. Fitter Du Renchang thought that in order to expand the anti-American and aid-Korea and patriotic propaganda, more slide projectors had to be made. Therefore, he painstakingly researched and designed a riveting machine to increase rivet production. After 45 days of research and experimentation, he finally succeeded completely on August 1st. The riveting machine he designed has a rolling cutter to cut the rivet material (copper wire) and a structure for punching the rivet head, so as long as the raw material (copper wire) is placed on the material feeding part of the machine, once the machine is turned on, rivets are ejected from the machine one by one. This riveting machine can be driven by electricity or by hand. When hand-cranked, it can produce 152 rivets per minute, which is more than 500 times more efficient than making them on a hexagonal lathe, and it also saves half of the material compared to the past.
    Du Renchang's creation has been praised by the factory leadership and the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions will display this automatic riveting machine in the Workers' Cultural Palace to organize workers throughout the city to observe and learn.

    南京科学仪器厂钳工杜仁昌
    苦心研究创造自动铆钉机
    可提高工作效率五百多倍
    南京国营科学仪器厂钳工杜仁昌创造自动铆钉机成功，使生产铆钉效率提高五百多倍。该厂主要生产科普式幻灯机，用铆钉很多。过去普通车床作一只铆钉要用八分二十四秒，用六角车床作也得三分二十五秒。因此，铆钉的产量有时配合不上其他部分的需要。钳工杜仁昌想到要扩大抗美援朝和爱国主义宣传，就必须多制幻灯机。因此他就苦心研究，设计铆钉机，以提高铆钉产量。经过四十五天的研究试验，终于在八月一日完全成功。他设计的铆钉机内有截断铆钉材料（铜丝）的轧刀，和冲铆钉头的结构，所以只要把原材料（铜丝）放到该机输送材料的部分上，机器一转动，一个个的铆钉就从机器里吐了出来。这种铆钉机可以用电带动，也可用手摇。用手摇每分钟可出铆钉一百五十二只，效率就比用六角车床制效率提高五百多倍，并比过去节省一半材料。
    杜仁昌的创造已受到该厂领导方面和南京市总工会的表扬。南京市总工会并将这种自动铆钉机陈列在工人文化宫，组织全市工人观摩。（新华社）
