(II) Expelling Imperialist Element Libri from China
    The imperialist spy Libri, who was cloaked in religious garb, has now been ordered by the Nanjing Military Control Commission to be permanently expelled from our country. Libri organized imperialist special agent espionage activities in the People's Republic of China, and secretly organized the illegal group "Legion of Mary" to resist the People's Government of China. The evidence is conclusive. Patriotic Catholics throughout the country have demanded the expulsion of Libri, and now their demands have been realized. This is a powerful blow to the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, who are using religion to carry out sabotage activities in our country, and a great encouragement to the patriotic movement of self-reliance and innovation of Chinese Catholics.
    During his four years in China, in addition to openly and actively participating in the anti-people's war of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and opposing the Chinese people's liberation cause, Libri also secretly used all despicable and shameless means to make Chinese Catholic groups an instrument of imperialist aggression. In order to cover up his shameless crimes, Libri vigorously promoted the fallacy of so-called Catholic "supra-politics." But it was precisely Libri's own criminal acts that thoroughly shattered the ghost of so-called Catholic "supra-politics" he spread.
    Libri not only personally organized the counter-revolutionary secret group "Legion of Mary" to carry out terrorist and sabotage activities, but also instructed his "representative" in Beijing, Madinuo, to collect our country's military intelligence. Madinuo also participated in the conspiracy to endanger our country's head of state and plot armed rebellion. This is the truth about so-called Catholic "supra-politics"! Libri repeatedly issued "instructions" prohibiting Catholics from participating in the International Democratic Women's Federation, the World Federation of Trade Unions, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which were fighting for peace and democracy, as well as various just activities presided over by these three major organizations; prohibiting Catholics from participating in patriotic activities and reading patriotic books and periodicals. This is the truth about so-called Catholic "supra-politics"!
    Now all the facts have proved that Libri and his lackeys are a group of the most despicable political conspirators cloaked in religious garb who specialize in serving imperialism. Their so-called "supra-politics" is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up their reactionary political conspiracy activities.
    After the political conspiracy activities of many imperialist elements in the Catholic Church were exposed by the people one by one, Libri repeatedly sophistically claimed: "The Church prohibits priests of any country from participating in politics... If there are... those engaged in political activities, they are limited to private capacity and have nothing to do with the Church." However, now ironclad facts have again proved that Libri himself, the so-called "Vatican representative in China," is precisely the instigator of many imperialist elements engaged in political conspiracy activities. When patriotic Catholics, under the patriotic call to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, launched a patriotic movement and were determined to break ties with imperialism, Libri shamelessly used the name of his so-called "Papal Nuncio" to repeatedly distribute counter-revolutionary "instructions" and "directives," openly inciting Chinese Catholics to be hostile to and resist our People's Government. Is this out of "private capacity"? Is this "nothing to do with the Church"?
    Libri directly adopted the most vicious means of threats and intimidation against Catholics. He abused the so-called "divine power" and arbitrarily arranged for batches of imperialist elements and foreign spies (such as Madinuo, Ford, Wen Guibin, Hua Lizhu, etc.) to usurp important positions in the Chinese Catholic Church, monopolize the power of the Church, carry out sabotage activities on the one hand, and suppress Chinese patriotic believers on the other. He often used "removing divine power" and "stopping divine work" to intimidate patriotic bishops and priests; and used "excommunication" and "going to hell" to intimidate ordinary patriotic believers. In the "orders" he issued, he dared to arrogantly stipulate that anyone who "expresses enthusiasm for the Communist Party" "must not participate in the Eucharist Mass" and "will be subject to the special punishment of expulsion from the Church by the Holy See." Under the oppression of Libri's abuse of "divine power," patriotic Catholics in China are constantly threatened, pure Chinese bishops and priests cannot raise their heads in the Church, and the self-reliance and innovation movement is hindered. Libri thought that by doing so, he could control the Chinese Catholic Church as a docile tool of imperialist aggression. But Libri's estimation was wrong. The era when imperialist elements rode on the heads of the Chinese people to wield power and issue orders has passed forever.
    As the Chinese people's patriotic movement has risen higher and higher, the political consciousness of Chinese Catholics has also gradually increased. Catholics in Beijing and Nanjing were not frightened by the mad threats of Libri and his pawns; on the contrary, with the support of the broad masses of people, they resolutely stood up and launched a frontal struggle against imperialism. They jointly issued patriotic declarations, held condemnation meetings and demonstrations. Patriotic Catholics in various districts of Beijing further recognized the shameless faces of Libri and his lackeys from the crimes of imperialist special agents and spies plotting armed rebellion, and voluntarily signed and issued declarations, resolutely and unanimously demanding: "Expel Libri!"
    The struggle of Catholics to demand the expulsion of Libri is sacred and just. This is the beginning of a new upsurge in the anti-imperialist struggle of the entire Chinese Catholic community. In this struggle, Catholics in our country should not only more clearly recognize the true face of imperialist elements, but also must learn how to continue to wage a victorious struggle against various disguised imperialist elements. Libri and his pawns have exhausted all means to confuse imperialist aggression with religious belief, attempting to provoke and undermine the unity of Catholics and the broad masses of people and the People's Government. However, the policy of our People's Government is very clear and unwavering. That is: we must resolutely strike at the conspiracy of imperialism to use religion to carry out aggression activities; and we must guarantee the freedom of religious belief of the Chinese people. Therefore, in this struggle, all law-abiding Catholics will further understand that under imperialist control, legitimate religious beliefs are not guaranteed, and only under the people's own regime can there be true freedom of religious belief. Therefore, for Catholics in our country, a primary issue today is to strictly distinguish between the enemy and ourselves; we must proceed from the standpoint of loving the motherland and loving the people, make up our minds, draw a clear line between ourselves and all imperialist elements and other counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the Catholic Church, and eliminate them. Only in this way is the only correct way out for all Catholics in the country.
    It should be pointed out that the imperialist elements and their lackeys in the Catholic Church will not be completely eliminated simply because Libri is expelled; the struggle will continue. However, as long as patriotic Catholics resolutely rise up, unite the broad masses of believers, and wage an uncompromising struggle against imperialist elements, they will surely achieve final victory. Patriotic Catholics should draw lessons from the struggle against Libri. These experiences will help every patriotic Catholic to further eliminate all imperialist forces within the Catholic Church and completely sever the ties between the Chinese Catholic Church and imperialism.

### （二）驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里出中国

   （二）驱逐帝国主义分子黎培里出中国
    披着宗教外衣的帝国主义间谍黎培里，现已由南京市军事管制委员会明令将他永远驱逐于我国国境之外。黎培里在我中华人民共和国境内，组织帝国主义特务间谍活动，秘密组织非法团体“圣母军”，反抗我国人民政府，罪证确凿。全国爱国的天主教徒曾纷纷要求驱逐黎培里，现在他们的要求实现了。这对于帝国主义特别是美帝国主义利用宗教在我国进行破坏活动的阴谋，是一个有力的打击；对于我国天主教徒自立革新的爱国运动是一个大的鼓励。
    黎培里在中国的四年多的时间中，除了公开积极参加美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的反人民战争，反对中国人民的解放事业以外，还秘密地用尽一切卑鄙无耻的手段，使中国的天主教团体成为帝国主义的侵略工具。为了掩饰他的无耻罪行，黎培里曾大肆吹嘘所谓天主教“超政治”的谬论。但是正是黎培里自己的罪恶行为，澈底粉碎了他所散布的所谓天主教“超政治”的鬼话。
    黎培里不但亲自组织反革命的秘密团体“圣母军”，进行恐怖与破坏活动，并且指使他在北京的
    “代表”马迪懦，搜集我国的军事情报。马迪懦并参加了危害我国国家元首、阴谋武装暴动的阴谋罪行。所谓天主教“超政治”的真相就是这样！黎培里一再发布“训令”，禁止天主教徒参加为和平民主事业而奋斗的国际民主妇联、世界工联、世界民主青联，以及这三大团体所主持的各种正义活动；禁止天主教徒参加爱国活动，阅读爱国书刊。所谓天主教“超政治”的真相就是这样！
    现在一切事实都已经证明，黎培里及其走狗们，正是一群披着宗教外衣，专门为帝国主义服务的最卑污的政治阴谋家。他们的所谓“超政治”，不过是作为掩护他们进行反动政治阴谋活动的烟幕而已。
    当天主教中许多帝国主义分子的政治阴谋活动一一被人民揭发以后，黎培里曾一再诡辩称：“教会禁止任何国家的神甫们参与政治，……万一有……从事于政治活动者，只限于私人名义，而与教会绝不相干。”但是，现在铁的事实又已经证明，所谓“梵蒂冈驻华代表”的黎培里本人，却正是许多帝国主义分子进行政治阴谋活动的主使者。当爱国的天主教徒在抗美援朝的爱国主义号召下，掀起了爱国运动，决心与帝国主义割断联系的时候，黎培里恬不知耻地用其所谓“教廷公使”的名义，迭次散发反革命的“训令”和“指示”，公然煽动中国天主教徒敌视和反抗我人民政府。这难道是出于
    “私人名义”吗？这难道是“与教会绝不相干”的吗？
    黎培里对于天主教徒直接采用了最毒辣的威胁与恫吓的手段。他滥用所谓“神权”，任意布置了成批的帝国主义分子和外国间谍分子（如马迪懦、福尔德以及文贵宾、华理柱等等），窃据中国天主教会的重要职位，总揽教会大权，一面进行破坏活动，一面压迫中国的爱国教徒。他动辄以“摘神权”、
    “停止神功”来威吓爱国的主教、神甫；以“开除教籍”、“下地狱”来威吓一般的爱国教徒。在他所发的“命令”中，竟敢狂妄地规定，凡“对共产党表示热忱”的，都“不得参与圣餐祭礼”，“要受到教廷驱逐出教的特别处分”。在黎培里滥用“神权”的压迫下，中国天主教的爱国教徒时时遭受威胁，纯正的中国主教、神甫在教会内不能抬头，自立革新运动遭受阻碍。黎培里满以为这样做就可以控制中国天主教会作为帝国主义的驯服的侵略工具。但是黎培里的估计是错了。帝国主义分子骑在中国人民头上作威作福发号施令的时代是已经永远过去了。
    当中国人民的爱国运动日益高涨的时候，中国天主教徒的政治觉悟也逐步提高。北京和南京各地的天主教徒没有被黎培里及其爪牙们的疯狂威胁所吓倒；相反的，他们在广大人民的支援之下，坚决地站了起来，与帝国主义展开了正面的斗争。他们联名发表了爱国宣言，举行了控诉大会和示威游行。北京各区爱国的天主教徒更从帝国主义特务间谍阴谋武装暴动的罪行中，进一步认清了黎培里及其走狗们的无耻面目，纷纷自动签名，发表宣言，坚决一致要求：“驱逐黎培里！”
    天主教徒要求驱逐黎培里的斗争，是神圣的，正义的。这是整个中国的天主教徒反帝国主义斗争的新高潮的开始。在这个斗争中，我国的天主教徒不仅应该更清楚地认识帝国主义分子的真面目，而且必须学会如何继续与各种伪装的帝国主义分子进行胜利的斗争。黎培里及其爪牙们曾用尽一切方法，把帝国主义的侵略活动与宗教信仰混同起来，企图挑拨与破坏天主教徒和广大人民及人民政府的团结。但是，我人民政府的政策是十分明白和坚定不移的。这就是：对于帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略活动的阴谋，必须坚决予以打击；而对于中国人民的宗教信仰自由则予以保障。因此，在这个斗争中，一切守法的天主教徒，都将更进一步懂得在帝国主义控制下，正当的宗教信仰是毫无保障的，而只有在人民自己的政权之下，才有真正的宗教信仰自由。因此，对于我国天主教徒来说，今天的一个首要问题是必须严格地分清敌我；必须从爱祖国爱人民的立场出发，下定决心，与潜藏在天主教内的一切帝国主义分子以及其他反革命分子分清界限，并且把他们清除出去。只有这样，才是全国一切天主教徒的唯一正当的出路。
    应该指出，天主教内的帝国主义分子及其走狗，并不会因为黎培里的被驱逐而即告肃清；斗争还将继续下去。但是，只要爱国的天主教人士，坚决地起来，团结广大教徒，与帝国主义分子展开不妥协的斗争，就一定能够取得最后的胜利。爱国的天主教徒应该从反对黎培里的斗争中取得经验。这些经验将会帮助每一个爱国的天主教徒，更进一步去肃清天主教内部的一切帝国主义势力，使中国的天主教澈底斩断与帝国主义的联系。
