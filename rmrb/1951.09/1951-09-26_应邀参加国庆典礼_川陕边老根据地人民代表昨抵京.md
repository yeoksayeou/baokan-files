Xinhua News Agency, September 25th. Forty representatives of the people from the old revolutionary base area on the Sichuan-Shaanxi border, invited by the Central People's Government to attend the National Day ceremony, arrived in Beijing this morning. Xie Juezai, Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, Vice Ministers Wu Xinyu, Yang Xiandong of the Ministry of Agriculture, Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies and concurrently Director of the Bureau of Government Offices of the State Council, and Zhou Zijian, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Government Offices, went to the railway station to welcome them.

All the representatives are outstanding figures and model family members of martyrs and military personnel who have persisted in the struggle for a long time under the bloody rule of the KMT-controlled areas. Among them, Jiang Dexin, who once served as the chairman of the village workers' and peasants' government, was repeatedly subjected to brutal torture by the Kuomintang reactionary government and landlords after the Red Army went north. He was unyielding and never revealed the local CPC organization and the whereabouts of the Red Army's remaining personnel. He Pu Shi, who once served as the women's director of the district workers' and peasants' government, lost her eldest son and daughter-in-law who heroically sacrificed themselves while serving in the Red Army, but she still bravely and unyieldingly persisted in the struggle, and after liberation, she personally sent her youngest son to join the People's Liberation Army.

The representatives also brought a large number of revolutionary cultural relics secretly treasured by the local people, as well as many banners and letters of greetings to Chairman Mao.

    应邀参加国庆典礼
    川陕边老根据地人民代表昨抵京
    【新华社二十五日讯】应中央人民政府邀请来京参加国庆典礼的川陕边老根据地人民代表四十人已于今日上午到达北京。中央人民政府内务部部长谢觉哉、副部长武新宇、农业部副部长杨显东和政务院典礼局兼机关事务管理局局长余心清、机关事务管理局副局长周子健等都亲往车站欢迎。
    全部代表都是在蒋区血腥统治下长期坚持斗争的优秀人物和模范的烈士家属、军人家属。其中曾任村工农政府主席的蒋德新，在红军北上后，曾屡遭国民党反动政府和地主严刑拷打，他坚贞不屈，始终没有供出当地中共组织和红军遗留人员的情况。曾任区工农政府妇女委员长的何蒲氏，她的大儿子和媳妇参加红军壮烈牺牲，但是她仍英勇不屈坚持斗争，解放后又亲送小儿子参加了人民解放军。
    代表们并带来当地人民秘密珍藏的大批革命文物及送给毛主席的许多锦旗和慰问信。
