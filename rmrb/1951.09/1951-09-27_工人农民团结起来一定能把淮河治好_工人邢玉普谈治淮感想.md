Workers and Peasants United Will Surely Harness the Huai River Well
——Worker Xing Yupu on His Thoughts on Harnessing the Huai River

I am a handcart worker, thirty-two years old this year, living at 92 Xinhua Street, Kaifeng City. For fifteen years, my family of eight has depended on me pulling a handcart to make a living. In the old society, pulling a handcart meant being beaten and scolded, suffering from cold and hunger, doing the work of an ox, and living a life worse than a pig. After the liberation of Kaifeng, I saw the sun and received warmth. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the lives of us workers have improved. We have organized a trade union. The handcart pullers were also organized into squadrons and teams. Everyone elected me as the captain of the third squadron, third team. I worked very hard, and everyone said that I played an exemplary role in my work. In January 1950, I gloriously joined the Communist Party.

On June 17 this year, the government called on handcart transport workers in Kaifeng to participate in the construction of the Shiman Reservoir on the Huai River. I was the first to sign up. I publicized Chairman Mao's call to fundamentally harness the Huai River to all the workers in our team, and everyone was willing to participate in harnessing the Huai River. I was elected as the captain of the third squadron for harnessing the Huai River.

On June 22, we officially started work. On the construction site, I made great efforts in uniting and loving each other, carrying out competitions, improving efficiency, maintaining cleanliness and hygiene, doing mass work, and resisting America and aiding Korea. At the end of the Shiman Reservoir project, I was rated as an A-level labor model. At that time, I was truly grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I thought: if it were not for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the people, defeating the Kuomintang reactionary government, and establishing a new society, how could I be where I am today! At the commendation meeting for celebrating achievements and praising models, I was so moved that tears came to my eyes.

During the month or so of working at the Shiman Reservoir, I saw thousands of peasants working day and night. Some were digging, some were loading, and some were carrying, just like an organized and disciplined army, working nervously and happily. This was a big thing that had never been heard of since ancient times. They can work and farm, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they can be concentrated to exert great strength in the great construction cause of the new China. Their spirit of enduring hardship, being hardworking, persevering, and brave moved me very much. I feel that as long as we workers unite closely with our peasant brothers, we will be able to build a happier and more beautiful new China.

In the work of harnessing the Huai River, I realized the great significance of harnessing the Huai River. I know that this is the first major project in the water conservancy construction of the new China. The completion of this project will not only eliminate the water disasters of the people in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, but also irrigate farmland, increase agricultural production, and generate electricity to develop the country's industry. In the process of carrying out the Huai River harnessing project, it can also be used as a form of work relief to provide relief to the disaster victims on both sides of the Huai River. Harnessing the Huai River is of great benefit to the country and the people. I feel very honored to be able to participate in this great national construction cause. Participating in harnessing the Huai River has given me the most practical education. I hope to have the opportunity to participate in harnessing the Huai River again during the winter repairs this year, and I guarantee to complete Chairman Mao's instruction to "definitely harness the Huai River well" with the greatest determination.

    工人农民团结起来一定能把淮河治好
    ——工人邢玉普谈治淮感想
    我是个架子车工人，现年三十二岁，家住开封市新华街九十二号。十五年来，全家八口人，都靠我拉架子车维持生活。在旧社会里拉架子车，挨打挨骂，受冻受饿，出的是牛力，过的是连猪都不如的生活。开封解放了，我看到了太阳，得到了温暖。在共产党毛主席的领导下，我们工人兄弟的生活得到了改善。我们组织了工会。拉架子车的又组织成中队，分队。大家选我为第三中队第三分队的队长。我工作得很有劲，大家说我在工作中起了模范作用。在一九五○年一月，我光荣地参加了共产党。
    今年六月十七日，政府号召开封架子车搬运工人参加修筑淮河石漫滩水库。我首先报了名。我把毛主席根治淮河的号召，向我们全队的工人兄弟进行宣传，大家都愿意参加治淮。我被选为治淮的第三中队的中队长。
    六月二十二日，我们正式上工。在工地上，我在团结友爱、开展竞赛、提高效率、清洁卫生、群众工作、抗美援朝等工作上，都作了很大的努力。在石漫滩水库的工程结束时，我被评为甲等劳动模范。当时我心中真感谢共产党毛主席，我想：要不是共产党毛主席领导人民，打垮了国民党反动政府，建立了新社会，我那会有今天！在庆功表扬模范的大会上，我感动得淌出眼泪来。
    在石漫滩水库工作的这一个多月中，我看到成千成万的农民兄弟日夜不停地劳动。他们挖的挖、装的装、抬的抬，就像一支有组织、有纪律的部队，紧张、愉快地劳动着。这是自古以来都没有听说过的大事情。他们会劳动，会种地，在共产党毛主席的领导下，他们更能够集中起来，在新中国的伟大建设事业中发挥很大的力量。他们那种吃苦耐劳、坚毅勇敢的工作精神，使我非常感动。我觉得我们工人阶级，只要和农民弟兄们紧紧地团结起来，就能够建设一个更幸福更美丽的新中国。
    在治淮工作中，我认识了治淮的伟大意义。我知道这是新中国的水利建设事业上的第一个大工程，完成了这个工程，不仅根除了河南、安徽、江苏三省人民的水患，还可以灌溉农田，增加农业生产，又可以发电，发展国家的工业。在进行治淮工程中，又可以以工代赈，救济淮河两岸的灾民。治淮对国家人民的利益是太大了。我能参加这个伟大的国家建设事业，我感到很光荣。参加治淮给了我最实际的教育。我希望今年冬修时还有机会参加治淮，我保证以最大的决心来完成毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的指示。（河南治淮总指挥部政治部）
