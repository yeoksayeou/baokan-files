    The People's Volunteer Army "Ordinary First Battalion"
    ——The Heroic Pioneer Battalion in the Battle of Dashuidong
    As told by Zhou Fuqi, written by He Song
    Comrade Zhou Fuqi is the political instructor of a battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and a combat hero who has been awarded the Military Merit Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. During the second phase of the Fifth Battle on the Korean battlefield, he commanded the entire battalion to complete the combat mission of directly inserting into Dashuidong in the Battle of Dashuidong. He played a key role in annihilating the U.S. 38th Regiment. In the battle to block the U.S. Marine 1st Division, he directly commanded his troops to annihilate an entire enemy company. The entire battalion was credited with meritorious service, and the Party Committee of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army awarded a banner inscribed "First Class Merit for Overseas Operations."
    (I)
    When U.S. imperialism invaded Korea and frantically advanced towards our country's border, we volunteered to go to the forefront of the anti-aggression struggle. During the first few days of our arrival in Korea, every comrade in the battalion, drinking a pot of water brought from the motherland, thought of the loveliness of the motherland. One day, we walked fifty li and saw that the road was full of bomb craters. The houses of the people were almost completely burned, completely different from our motherland on the Yalu River, which made us feel even more deeply the importance of the sacred responsibility of defending our country. Later, our troops advanced to a village near Baochuan and saw three human hearts hanging on a tree. Here, the American aggressors brutally murdered a family of three of Korean people, leaving behind a fourteen-year-old and a four-year-old child who could not be killed in time. The family of three was murdered simply because the child's sister resisted the rape of an American soldier. The sister, mother, and father were all disemboweled by the American soldiers and their hearts hung on the tree. The remaining two children had nowhere to go! The children, with tearful eyes, looked at us and said: Save us, avenge our father, mother, and sister! The comrades in our battalion learned a lesson here: This is the brutality of the American beasts! Chen Zhendong, a communication soldier of our battalion headquarters, covered his face, stomped his feet, and cried, "I think of my mother, who had one of her arms cut off when she resisted the rape of my sister by the Japanese devils!" Everyone saw that the atrocities of the American beasts were even more barbaric and cruel than the Japanese invaders who had invaded China in the past, and they were extremely indignant! Why are we resisting America and aiding Korea? It is to prevent such tragic situations from happening again in our motherland, to fight for our motherland! To fight for the survival of children and mothers! The children and mothers of Korea are our children and mothers. We must protect our fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters; we must avenge the fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters of Korea! To fight for the motherland! To fight for the defense of the Far East and world peace! Therefore, the comrades marched day and night, without being tired. Sometimes they could not eat enough food or drink enough water, but when they thought of the motherland, of the countless parents and children of the motherland, and of the suffering of the Korean people, they forgot everything! Everyone was of one mind, thinking about one thing, which was: Eliminate the enemy and strive for victory!

    During the Fifth Battle, in the Dashuidong battle north of Hongchuan, our battalion was the assault battalion and the vanguard battalion. It broke through from Banxiangli, more than forty li north of Dashuidong, and inserted into the U.S. 38th Regiment's position in Dashuidong, cutting off the Hongchuan Highway. In this battle to annihilate the U.S. 38th Regiment, it played an important role. At the same time, it blocked the reinforcement of the U.S. Marine 1st Division and annihilated an entire reinforcement company of the U.S. military. The Battle of Dashuidong, from May 16th to 20th, lasted for four days and four nights. Our battalion captured more than sixty enemy officers and soldiers, including the enemy battalion commander, killed and wounded more than five hundred enemies, and completed the task of vanguard breakthrough and annihilation of a part of the enemy. The entire battalion was credited. During the battle, the commanders, combatants, staff members, Communist Party members, and non-Party fighters of our battalion all demonstrated unparalleled heroism and tenacity, and countless heroic miracles emerged.
    (II)
    On the night of May 17th, the main force of our battalion, after a forced march of forty to fifty li, cleverly broke through the enemy's three lines of blockade and inserted into Dashuidong. At this time, the two U.S. regiments north of Dashuidong had already fallen far behind us, and the headquarters of the U.S. 38th Regiment had been exposed in front of us. When we accepted the task of vanguard penetration, all the comrades in the battalion realized that: Being able to strive to be a vanguard battalion on the Korean battlefield is an unparalleled honor! This is the glorious task assigned to us by the Party! Everyone was fearless and devoted themselves to carrying out their tasks. Now, the troops of ours that have penetrated into the enemy's position have already begun a fierce hand-to-hand battle with the enemy. At the most critical moment of the battle, the deputy regimental commander went deep into command and told our battalion that the task was: "Seize the enemy's artillery position, cut off the Hongchuan Highway, divide the enemy's regimental headquarters from the division headquarters, and ensure that the fraternal troops come in to annihilate the enemy." This task is serious, and this is the most important key to winning the victory in Dashuidong. At this most critical moment, the battalion Party committee issued the call to "resolutely complete the combat task and win glory for the motherland"! Tao Jinshan, the company commander of a certain company, came out and said, "The superiors should make a decision quickly, our time has come!" In the company he led, the soldiers were so anxious that they were on fire, wanting the superiors to give them tasks. This most serious task was given to them. The battalion Party committee called on them: "We must attack fiercely, defend firmly, and be prepared to fight off the enemy's five, ten, or even dozens of counterattacks!" The deputy regimental commander also personally mobilized the troops. Then, the attack began. Our artillery preemptively struck, and the warriors suddenly appeared in front of the enemy. After a burst of fierce fighting, this heroic company seized the enemy's artillery position, captured four chemical cannons, cut off the highway, and divided the enemy. From then on, the enemy's counterattacks began one after another. After repelling one of the enemy's counterattacks, company commander Tao Jinshan was wounded. The instructor advised him to go down, but he said, "A Communist Party member, when you need to shed your own blood, you must be happy, joyful, and brave to take it out and seek happiness for mankind! Today, our position is the key to determining the victory in the Battle of Dashuidong. Our task is related to the safety of the motherland. Therefore, I cannot go down!" The enemy continued to counterattack, and the warriors fought fiercely. Once, our machine gun shooter, Wei Ming, blew up his machine gun. Later, he went out to stand guard fifty or sixty meters away from the position with only a shovel. The counterattacking enemy came up again. He hid behind the obstacles, and when the enemy got close, he jumped out, swung his shovel, and with a crack, the head of the enemy company commander in front of him was severed. He then threw a few large stones, disrupting the enemy's formation, causing them to drop their guns and run away. At this time, machine gun shooter Wei Ming picked up the enemy's discarded machine gun, turned the muzzle around, and set it up to fire. He single-handedly repelled the enemy's counterattack. When our people rushed up from behind, he had already captured a machine gun, three carbines, and a pistol, and captured an American soldier. Later, in defeating another counterattack by the enemy, company commander Tao Jinshan was hit by two enemy incendiary bombs and his whole body was on fire. At this time, Communist Party member Tao Jinshan personally appointed platoon leader Cui Jianguo as acting company commander to continue the mission. At this time, the fire was still burning on his body. He said to Cui Jianguo, "I order you to strive to accept the Party's task within five minutes. I will shed the last drop of blood for the Party, for the motherland, and for mankind, but shedding blood is worth it, the people of the motherland and the people of the world will never forget it! I finally order you to be the acting company commander, you must complete the task that I have not completed, annihilate the enemy, and hold the position, that is to avenge me! Final victory will surely belong to the Chinese and Korean people!" Saying this, he gloriously sacrificed himself. The words of Communist Party member Tao Jinshan are a kind of power. As the enemy counterattacked again, Cui Jianguo jumped up and said loudly, "Comrades, have you heard what Company Commander Tao said? We must wipe away our tears, straighten our chests, annihilate the enemy, and avenge the company commander!" The warriors held their guns, aiming at the rushing enemy, wishing they could rush up and cut off a piece of flesh. Waiting for the enemy to get within thirty meters, the warriors charged with their rifles and bayonets! This was the most intense of several bayonet charges. Squad leader Shen Xue Li, who had already been wounded four times, still shouted slogans during the bayonet charge: "Comrades, U.S. imperialism is our mortal enemy, if you don't kill them, they will kill you. We must kill them quickly, kill them painfully, kill them ruthlessly! Avenge the company commander!" The rushing enemy was annihilated by us. On this position where the bayonet charge had taken place, some gunstocks were broken in half, some bayonets were bent, some soldiers bit off the noses and ears of the enemy; in the hand of a warrior who had already sacrificed himself, he was still holding two grenades tightly, still raising his arms in a throwing gesture, still raising his head, not closing his angry eyes glaring at the enemy! On the Korean battlefield, our warriors simply did not know death, only knew how to eliminate the enemy! The indomitable and fearless spirit of the martyrs will always live on! No matter how crazy the enemy is, how can they not tremble in front of our warriors? The enemy who came to charge again and again, every time they fought with us, seeing the heroic spirit of the warriors, their morale would drop by half first. Some of the prisoners were simply so frightened that they collapsed and could not even walk. This time, there were more than three hundred enemy corpses displayed on the position.
    (III)
    While seizing the artillery position, another part of our battalion inserted into the other side of the U.S. 38th Regiment headquarters, seized the 535 Highland, and controlled the commanding height. The battalion commander personally led the troops and directly commanded the vanguard platoon to seize this highland. After launching the attack, Zhang Dongsheng, the squad leader of the vanguard squad of the vanguard platoon, was wounded. The battalion commander asked him to go down, but he said, "I have not completed the task. The battalion Party committee called for not leaving the front line with minor injuries, I am a Communist Party member, and I should have this kind of performance!" To seize the highland, we must first cross a river, with water chest-deep. The battalion commander cared about Zhang Dongsheng's wound and did not let him cross the river. Zhang Dongsheng said again, "Our squad has accepted the vanguard task, which is the glory in the history of the whole squad. How can I abandon this task?" When crossing the river, Zhang Dongsheng stood in the middle of the river, enduring the pain of his wound, raised his gun, and personally covered the entire squad to cross the river. When snatching a small hill in front of the 535 Highland, fifty meters away from the enemy's position on the hill, there was the enemy's company command post, with four machine guns set up, and a radio station, guarded by two enemy squads. At this time, Zhang Dongsheng's vanguard squad, which was in charge of the frontal attack, after several battles, annihilated more than 30 enemy soldiers, only Zhang Dongsheng himself could still fight. At this time, he had been wounded for the second time. However, he saw the enemy on the hilltop, madly strafing another squad of ours in charge of the flanking attack. He thought, "I am a Communist Party member, even if there is only one person left, I must complete the task. Why should I watch the enemy attack our own people?" Regardless of the pain in his leg, he climbed up the mountain step by step. After climbing thirty meters, only twenty meters away from the enemy, he was shot again, damaging one of his hands. This was his third injury, but he didn't say a word. He stopped, took out a first-aid kit, and bandaged his wound. At this time, he could see the enemy's machine guns and radio station clearly. This made him feel the arduousness and glory of the task even more, and made him even more determined to complete the task. He thought: The victory in sight cannot be let go, and the troops cannot be allowed to pay a greater price to seize this position. Therefore, he moved his injured hands and feet and continued to move forward! After crawling a few steps, he saw that the American soldiers were using the radio to communicate and continued to attack our troops attacking from the flank. He couldn't care about the pain of his wound. With one hand injured and unusable, he took out three grenades with the other hand, bit open the lids with his mouth, removed the pins with his tongue, and bit them together, and then, with hatred, threw them at the enemy one after another. Two of the enemy's four machine guns were destroyed, and the radio station was also destroyed. Seven American soldiers were injured, four died, and two were so frightened that they knelt on the ground and surrendered to us. At this time, Zhang Dongsheng was only ten meters away from the enemy. He climbed forward with all his might and captured the enemy's guns. The platoon leader led a squad attacking from the flank and successfully occupied this hill, creating a prerequisite for taking the 535 Highland. At this time, the platoon leader saw that Zhang Dongsheng's hands, feet, and waist were all injured and asked him to go down to rest. Zhang Dongsheng said again, "Now our platoon has not completed the task assigned to us by the Party. The people of the motherland and the world are watching us. I want to continue to advance with our platoon!" Advancing is victory. Thus, encouraged by Communist Party member Zhang Dongsheng, the comrades advanced bravely and captured the 535 Highland. At this point, our troops who seized the 535 Highland and the artillery position, like two sharp knives, inserted into both sides of the headquarters of the U.S. 38th Regiment, completely dividing the enemy's connection. They successively annihilated more than 400 enemy soldiers. On the 18th, as dawn was approaching, the main force of our regiment arrived. In coordination with the fraternal troops, after a fierce battle, the entire U.S. 38th Regiment was basically annihilated.
    (IV)
    In order to ensure the completion of the task by the forward penetration troops, and to hold back the enemy behind, another unit of the battalion, guarding the mountain head of Banxiangli, fought for two days and one night from May 17th to 18th, without drinking water or eating food. All the wounded were also without water or food for two days and one night. The troops were undergoing a test, insisting on guarding. On the 18th, during the most difficult days, platoon leader Liu Yueyong was most concerned about the hunger and thirst of the wounded and the soldiers. So, he stepped forward and said to everyone, "Comrades, I am a Communist Party member, and we are the Chinese People's Volunteer Army under the leadership of the Party. In front of us, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. We must continue to fight, we must live! Who are the Communist Party members and Youth League members, stand up! We will go to the enemy to grab water!" Immediately, a dozen Party members and Youth League members stood up in formation. All the wounded and all the soldiers involuntarily shouted: "Long live the Communist Party! Long live the Communist Party!" At this time, a little devil named Mo Qiu cried, he said: "I am not a Party member, nor a League member, can't I go? Can't I earn merit?" Liu Yueyong then said to everyone, "Comrades, all those who have signed up are good. Our revolution has not yet been finally victorious, and there are heavy tasks ahead. Let whoever goes, no one should be too excited, and if no one is approved to go, no one should be unhappy." Finally, only himself, another Youth League member, and the little devil Mo Qiu were approved, a total of three people, each carrying eight water bottles, and platoon leader Liu Yueyong led them to the enemy to grab water! Walking out of the position, Liu Yueyong asked the two of them, "What is our task?" They answered, "Grabbing water." Liu Yueyong immediately corrected and said, "No, we are the vanguard battalion, we are the vanguard task, we must remember the call of the battalion Party committee and go to complete the task!" The three of them, inserted from Banxiangli into the enemy's position in Guyuedong, arrived near the enemy fifty meters away, and saw an enemy squad in the ravine, with biscuits, soda water, eating and drinking, talking and laughing. Liu Yueyong saw it clearly, and he was both angry and happy in his heart. He was angry that the enemy was so complacent here; he was happy that everything the enemy had would become ours in a while. He said to the Youth League member and the little devil beside him, "Listen to my order, open fire together, throw grenades together!" Then they threw two grenades each. As soon as the grenades exploded, the guns fired together. As soon as the grenades exploded and the guns fired, four enemies were killed on the spot, seven were injured, and one was so frightened that he knelt there, raising his hands, and the bread in his mouth could not be swallowed. In an instant, the battle ended, and they captured a machine gun, four carbines, and six automatic rifles. The water bottles brought by the three were all filled with water, and they went back. After Liu Yueyong and the three of them came out, company commander Feng Changyuan was worried to death. Hearing the gunfire and grenades in front of them, he thought the three of them were finished. So he sent a squad to save them. Just as the squad was about to go, Liu Yueyong and the three of them had already returned victoriously. As soon as Liu Yueyong went up, he first invited the company commander to drink water. The company commander was extremely happy, but he did not drink the water. He said, "This water was exchanged for your lives, I can't drink it first, you let the wounded comrades drink it first!" The wounded and the soldiers were extremely happy to see that there was soda water and bread, and shouted: "Long live the Communist Party, long live Liu Yueyong!" The water was first given to the wounded to drink. Later, because there were many people and little water, Liu Yueyong proposed to the soldiers that they would get through the difficulty with three mouthfuls of water, and each person could only drink three mouthfuls of water. The days were more difficult, the more united we were. Everyone only drank two mouthfuls and automatically saved one mouthful, saving a total of eleven bottles of water. After discussion, everyone decided: to save the eleven bottles of water and leave them all for the wounded to drink. Finally, a celebration meeting was held on the position, and the wounded and soldiers celebrated Liu Yueyong's victory. At the celebration meeting, Liu Yueyong was raised high and cheered: "Long live the hero who grabbed the water!" They were just like that, overcoming difficulties and insisting on guarding. They successively eliminated more than one hundred enemies on the front line of the position.
    (V)
    On the 18th, in Dashuidong, our battalion completed the vanguard mission. The soldiers had been extremely tired after three days and two nights of fierce fighting, and fell asleep as soon as they fell to the ground. At this time, four regiments of the U.S. Marine 1st Division reinforced and advanced north. The two enemy regiments in the north also attempted to break through to the south, and we were already facing six enemy regiments. The regiment gave us the task of blocking the enemy. The battalion Party committee issued an emergency call and mobilized urgently to fight to fiercely strike the enemy venturing north and protect the victorious fruits of Dashuidong! People are in the position, the position is in place, and every inch of land must be defended! I said to platoon leader Shi Dengying: "Your time to be tested has come!" Shi Dengying said: "The more difficult the task, the more glorious it is!" Later, he led twelve warriors to hold the mountain head. This was the key to ensuring the victory of our blocking war. In the beginning, two or three hundred enemies, without paying attention to formation, rushed head-on and were fiercely beaten down by the twelve warriors. This time, the enemy could not reorganize their ranks for one or two hours and dared not charge. Shi Dengying took advantage of the gap to lead the soldiers to add and repair fortifications to prevent the enemy's three-sided attack. Shi Dengying cherished the soldiers very much, and he personally delivered the food sent by the motherland, one by one, to the anti-aircraft shelter of each soldier. Then, seventeen enemy planes, seven tanks, and more than ten cannons, covered by infantry, rushed towards the mountain head again. The planes dropped incendiary bombs and gasoline barrels, and the mountain head was all on fire. The enemy attacked again and again. However, the more difficult it was for our twelve warriors, the more they thought of ways to eliminate the enemy and preserve themselves. We changed as the enemy changed. The enemy was cunning, and we were flexible. From 12:00 noon to 5:00 pm, we fought for half a day, and we always held the enemy back, but the enemy could not hold us back. We successively repelled the enemy's four charges and one counterattack. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 100 casualties, and we had no casualties. With the twelve warriors, the mountain head was also there!

    On the same day, another unit of the enemy who broke through from north to south, sneaked into our battalion headquarters from behind. Our companies were all undertaking heavy tasks in the front. However, the enemy's planes, dropping incendiary bombs and gasoline barrels, covered their troops and attacked the battalion headquarters. At this time, the deputy regimental commander who came to our battalion calmly said: "We must think of ways to beat the enemy down!" We all thought of taking the initiative to attack and strike the enemy. I said to the comrades: "The time has come to do meritorious service for the people of the motherland. At this time, we must organize a hero team. Whoever volunteers to participate, raise your hand and stand up!" Immediately thirty-two fists were raised, and thirty-two people stood up. They were the medical soldiers, stretcher bearers, cooks, cultural teachers, communication soldiers, buglers, and barbers in our battalion. Everyone knew what to do at this time. Chen Zhendong, the external communication soldier, recently received a photo of his mother and a letter, which said: "Don't forget why I lost an arm." Chen Zhendong did not forget, and now he stood in the hero team. Xiao Tian, the internal communication soldier, said: "Now there is no need for internal affairs, I will also join the hero team!" The thirty-two people were temporarily divided into four squads and formed a team. Yang Jingxing, the artillery platoon leader, also signed up to participate and became the captain of the hero team. They were all holding guns in their hands. Seeing the battalion instructor standing up to hit the machine gun and suppress the enemy's firepower, and hearing the charge horn, they attacked from all sides, rushing towards the enemy less than fifty meters away from our position! In this way, attacking to defend, they defeated an enemy company's attack. The enemy's company commander was captured alive by our cook squad leader. Chen Zhendong also did not fall behind. He captured an enemy carbine and an automatic rifle, and captured an American soldier alive. This time, a total of eighteen enemies were captured alive, more than eighty enemies were killed and wounded, and a light and heavy machine gun each, four carbines, and six automatic rifles were captured. Everyone in the hero team was credited.
    (VI)
    On the 19th, in order to regain control of the 535 Highland and cover the troops' active transfer, we completely and thoroughly annihilated a company of the U.S. Marine 1st Division on the highland. This was our last battle in this blocking war! The task we accepted was arduous. At this time, as long as there was a task, the soldiers still ignored their fatigue, automatically expressed their attitude, and resolutely carried out the task! The company expressed its attitude to the battalion, and the battalion expressed its attitude to the regiment, resolutely carrying out this task. At the same time, we had to win more with less, and we had to be brave and flexible. When before dawn on the 19th, our frontal attack troops approached the enemy 200 meters away, and the roundabout flanking troops arrived near the enemy 60 meters away, the proud and paralyzed enemy was still dreaming. When the enemy discovered, our frontal troops had already launched an attack, and the enemy was forced to come out of the position to fight in a hurry. The enemy company commander set up a telescope to command on the position. At this time, our roundabout flanking troops suddenly appeared from the enemy's back 60 meters away, occupied the enemy's position, and captured the enemy company commander alive. The enemy who came out of the position to fight in a hurry was about to turn around to deal with our roundabout flanking troops when they realized that their position had been lost and their company commander had become a prisoner. We were shooting at them from the position, from a high position. The enemy, whose return route had been cut off, wanted to flee south. However, when the enemy was hesitating, our heavy weapons firepower had already exceeded the shooting range of 150 meters and intercepted the enemy. In this way, an entire enemy company was annihilated! In this way, we surprised the enemy, approached the enemy, mobilized the enemy, and eliminated the enemy outside the enemy's position. In this way, we won more with less, and at the cost of six casualties, we annihilated an entire enemy company.

    Why can our troops defeat the majority of the invading troops of the armed-to-the-teeth U.S. imperialism with a small number of soldiers and ordinary equipment? It is true that U.S. imperialism is indeed the king of imperialism, possessing modern equipment, being crazy, brutal, and cunning. However, the war they are waging is unjust. They are only cannon fodder for a few financial capitalists on Wall Street, so their troops are cowardly, corrupt, and shameless. Therefore, no matter how U.S. imperialism brags about its "air and sea superiority," it cannot avoid being annihilated by us; moreover, it will inevitably fail completely in the end. And we, taking our battalion as an example, are just an ordinary battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield. On the Korean battlefield, there are many such battalions as ours, all fighting so bravely and eliminating the enemy. This is because we are the people's army, a force composed of the Chinese people under the leadership and education of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. There is strong Party leadership in our troops, and countless Communist Party members like Tao Jinshan and Liu Yueyong play their advanced role, so that we can overcome all difficulties, defeat the powerful enemy, and be invincible forever!

    U.S. imperialism has suffered a serious blow on the Korean battlefield, but it still has no intention of repenting and is arrogantly preparing to continue to expand the war of aggression. The fact that it has repeatedly sabotaged the Korean peace talks recently is enough to prove this point. Now, U.S. imperialism is manipulating the San Francisco Conference to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan, which is of course illegal and invalid. We love peace, and in order to strive for peace, we resolutely oppose wars of aggression. If U.S. imperialism still dares to continue to expand the war of aggression so recklessly, it will continue to suffer more severe blows! The situation of the war will not be pleasant for the enemy, and final victory will surely belong to the Chinese and Korean people!

    人民志愿军“普通一营”
    ——大水洞歼灭战中的尖刀英雄营
    周福祺讲述  何松记
    周福祺同志是中国人民志愿军某部的营政治教导员，是荣膺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军功章的战斗英雄。他在朝鲜战场第五次战役第二阶段的大水洞歼灭战中，指挥全营完成了直插大水洞的战斗任务。对歼灭美军第三十八团起了关键作用。在阻击美军陆战第一师战斗中，他直接指挥部队，歼灭敌人一个整连，获全营记功，志愿军某部党委奖给“出国作战第一功”锦旗一面。
    （一）
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，向我祖国边境疯狂进犯的时候，我们志愿走上了反侵略斗争的最前线。我们到朝鲜的头几天，营里的每一个同志，喝着从祖国带来的一壶水，就想着祖国的可爱。有一天，我们走了五十里路，看见一路全是炸弹坑，老百姓的房子，差不多烧得精光，和鸭绿江那边我们的祖国完全两样，使我们更加感受到保家卫国的神圣责任的重大了。后来我们的部队前进到抱川附近一个村庄，看见一棵树上挂三颗人心。在这里，美国侵略军，残杀了朝鲜老百姓的一家三口，剩下来不及杀死的一个十四岁和一个四岁的孩子。一家三口被杀害，只是因为孩子的姐姐，反抗了美国兵的强奸，姐姐、母亲和父亲一起，被美国兵扒出心来，挂到树上。剩下的这两个孩子无家可归！孩子泪汪汪的两眼望着我们说：救救我们，替我们的爸爸、妈妈和姐姐报仇！我们营里的同志，就在这里上了一课：这就是美国野兽的暴行！我们营部一个通讯员陈振东看到这个情形，掩住面，跺着脚，哭起来了，他说：“我想起我的母亲，她在反抗日本鬼子强奸我的姐姐时，被砍断了一只胳膊！”大家看到美国野兽的暴行，比过去侵略中国的日本强盗还要野蛮残忍，都愤恨极了！我们为什么要抗美援朝？就是为了不让这种悲惨的情形再在我们的祖国发生，为祖国而战！为孩子和母亲的生存而战！朝鲜的孩子和母亲，就是我们的孩子和母亲，我们要保卫我们的父老兄弟姐妹；要为朝鲜的父老兄弟姐妹们复仇！为祖国而战！为保卫远东与世界和平而战！因此，同志们日夜行军，不嫌疲劳，有时吃不饱饭，喝不到水，但是，想到祖国，想到祖国的无数父母和孩子，想到朝鲜人民的痛苦，就忘记了一切！大家一条心，想着一件事，就是：消灭敌人，争取胜利！
    第五次战役中，在洪川以北的大水洞战斗，我们的营是突击营又是尖刀营，自大水洞以北四十余里板项里突破，插入大水洞美军第三十八团阵地，切断洪川公路。在这次歼灭美军第三十八团的战斗中，起到了重要的作用。同时，阻击了美军陆战第一师的增援，歼灭增援的美军一个整连。大水洞战斗，自五月十六日至二十日，经过四天四夜，我们营活捉敌人营长以下官兵六十多名，打死打伤敌人五百多名，完成了尖刀突破和歼敌一部的任务，全营记了功。战斗中，我们营的指挥员、战斗员、工作人员、共产党员和非党战士都表现了无比的英勇顽强，出现了无数的英雄奇迹。

    五月十七日夜里，我们营的主力部队，经过四五十里的强行军，巧妙地突破了敌人三道封锁线，插入了大水洞。这时，大水洞以北的美军两个团，早已远远落在我们背后，美军第三十八团团部，已经暴露在我们面前。当我们接受尖刀穿插任务的时候，全营的同志们都认识到：在朝鲜战场，能够争取当个尖刀营，是无尚光荣的！这是党交给我们的光荣任务！人人都是奋不顾身，执行任务。现在，我们插入敌人阵地的部队，已经和敌人开始了激烈的交手战。在战斗的最紧要关头，副团长深入指挥，告诉我们营的任务是：“夺取敌人炮兵阵地，切断洪川公路，分割敌人团部和师部的联系，保证兄弟部队进来歼灭敌人。”这个任务是严重的，这是争取大水洞胜利最重要的关键。在这个最紧要的关头里，营党委发出了“坚决完成战斗任务，为祖国争光”的号召！某连连长陶金山走了出来，说：“上级赶快下决心吧，用我们的时候到了！”在他带领的连里，战士们都急得全身冒火，要上面给他们任务。这个最严重的任务是交给他们了。营党委号召他们：“要攻得猛，守得硬，要准备打下敌人五次十次以至几十次的反击！”副团长也亲自向部队作了动员。接着，攻击开始。我们的炮火先发制人，勇士们在敌人面前突然出现，展开一阵激战之后，这个英雄连队，夺取了敌人炮兵阵地，缴获了化学炮四门，切断了公路，分割了敌人。从此，敌人一次又一次的反击开始了。打下敌人的一次反击之后，连长陶金山负伤了，指导员劝他下去，他说：“一个共产党员，当需要你流自己的鲜血的时候，自己就要高兴、愉快、勇敢地拿出来，为人类求幸福！今天，我们这个阵地，是决定大水洞战斗胜利的关键。我们的任务，关系着祖国的安全。因此，我不能下去！”敌人不断反击，勇士们打得真冒火。有一次，我们的一个机枪射手魏明，把机枪都打炸了，后来他一个人，背一把铁锹，一直伸到阵地的五、六十公尺以外去站岗。反击的敌人又上来了，他藏身在障碍物后面，等敌人走得近了，跳出来，抡起铁锹，格嚓一声，走在前面的敌人连长，头已落地。接连又投过去几块大石块，打得敌人乱了阵，丢下枪，掉头就跑。这时，机枪射手魏明拾起敌人丢下的机枪，掉转枪口，架起就打。他一个人，打下敌人一个连的反击。等我们的人从后面赶上来时，他已经缴了机枪一挺，卡宾枪三支，手枪一支，还俘掳了一个美国兵。后来，在打垮敌人的又一次反击中，连长陶金山中了敌人的两颗燃烧弹，全身着火。就在这个时候，共产党员陶金山，亲自交代排长崔建国为代理连长，继续完成任务。这时，火还在他身上烧着，他对崔建国说：“我命令你争取在五分钟的时间内，接受党的任务，我将要为党，为祖国，为人类流尽最后一滴血，但是，流血是值得的，祖国人民和世界人类永远不会忘记的！我最后命令你为代理连长，你要完成我所没完成的任务，歼灭敌人，守住阵地，就是为我报仇！最后胜利一定属于中、朝人民的！”说到这里，他就光荣牺牲了。共产党员陶金山的话，就是一种力量。随着敌人又一次反击上来。崔建国跳起来，大声说：“同志们，陶连长的话听见了吗？我们要擦干眼泪，挺起胸膛，歼灭敌人，为连长报仇！”勇士们端好枪，看准冲上来的敌人，恨不得立即上去，戮下一块肉来。等着敌人走近三十公尺，勇士们顶膛火一上，刺刀一上，拚开了！这是接连几次拚刺刀最激烈的一次。班长申学礼，已经四次负伤，拚刺刀还喊口号：“同志们，美帝国主义是我们的死敌，你不杀他，他杀你。我们要杀得快，杀得痛，杀得狠！为连长报仇！”冲上来的敌人被我们消灭了。在这次拚过刺刀的阵地上，有的枪柄折成两半的，有的刺刀刺得弯弯的，有的战士咬下了敌人的鼻子和耳朵；在一个已经牺牲了的勇士的一只手里，仍然紧紧地握住两颗手榴弹，仍然直起的手臂作出打手榴弹的姿势，仍然昂起头，没有闭上怒视敌人的两眼！在朝鲜战场上，我们的勇士简直不知道死，只知道消灭敌人！烈士们不屈不挠的大无畏的精神，永远是活着的！那怕是怎么样疯狂的敌人，在我们这样的勇士们面前，怎么能不发抖呢？一次又一次来冲锋的敌人，每次和我们一交上手，看到勇士们的英雄气概，他们的士气便先低落了一半，有些俘虏简直吓得软瘫了，走都走不动。这次在阵地上陈列着敌人的尸体有三百多具。
    （三）
    在夺取炮兵阵地的同时，我营另一部插到美军第三十八团团部的另一边，抢占五三五高地，控制制高点。营长亲自带领部队，直接指挥尖刀排，抢占这个高地。发起攻击后，尖刀排的尖刀班班长张东生负伤了。营长要他下去，他说：“我还没有完成任务。营党委号召轻伤不下火线，我是共产党员，应该有这种表现！”抢占高地，先要强渡一条河，河水齐胸深，营长又关心张东生的伤口，不让他渡河。张东生又说：“我们班接受了尖刀任务，是全班历史上的光荣，我怎么能抛弃这个任务？”强渡的时候，张东生站在河中间，忍住伤口痛。端起枪，亲自掩护全班过河。当抢夺五三五高地前面的一个小山头的时候，离山头上敌人阵地五十公尺，那里是敌人一个连的指挥所，架着四挺机枪，还设有电台，有敌人两个班的兵力守卫。这个时候，担任正面攻击的张东生尖刀班，经过数次搏战，歼灭敌人一个排三十余人之后，只有张东生一个人还能作战，这时他已经第二次负伤。可是，他看见山头上的敌人，正在疯狂扫射担任侧翼攻击的我们另外一个班。他想：“我是共产党员，剩下一个人也要完成任务，为什么还眼看着敌人打自己的人呢？他就不顾腿上的伤口痛，往山上一步一步爬上去，爬了三十公尺，离敌人只还有二十多公尺，敌人一打，把他的一只手又打坏了，这是他第三次负伤了，可是，他根本就没吭气，他停下来，取出急救包，包扎伤口。这个时候，敌人的机枪、电台，他已经看得清清楚楚，这就越发使他感到任务的艰巨和光荣，越发使他下定决心要完成任务。他想：眼看到的胜利，不能把他放过去，不能让部队拿出更大的代价来夺取这个阵地。因此，他挪动着负了伤的手和脚，继续前进！往前爬了几步，他又看到那里的美军正在使用着报话机，进行着通讯联络，又在继续打着我们从侧翼攻击的部队。他就更顾不了伤口痛，一只手打坏不能使用了，用另外一只手，一起取出三颗手榴弹，用嘴咬开盖子，用舌头剔出弹弦，又用嘴咬在一起，随着仇恨，朝着敌人，一个接一个地打了过去。敌人的四挺机枪被炸坏两挺，电台也炸坏了，美国兵伤了七个，死了四个，还有两个吓得跪在地上向我们缴枪。这个时候，张东生离开敌人只有十多公尺，他用力爬上前去，缴了敌人的枪。排长带领着侧翼攻击的一个班，顺利地占领了这个山头，造成了拿下五三五高地的先决条件。这个时候，排长看见张东生手脚和腰都负了伤，要他下去休息，张东生又说：“现在我们的排，还没有完成党所交给我们的任务。祖国和世界的人民，都在看着我们。我还要跟着我们的排，继续前进！”前进便是胜利，于是，被共产党员张东生鼓舞下的同志们，奋勇前进，打下了五三五高地。至此，我们夺取了五三五高地和炮兵阵地的部队，就像两把锋利的尖刀，一前一后，插到了美国第三十八团团部的两面。完全分割了敌人的联系。先后消灭敌人四百余人。十八日，天快明的时候，我们团的主力赶到了，在兄弟部队的配合下，激战一场，基本歼灭了美军第三十八团的全部。
    （四）
    为了保证前面穿插部队的完成任务，为了扯住后面的敌人，营的另一部队，守备在板项里的山头，从五月十七日到十八日，打了两天一夜，喝不上水，吃不上饭。所有伤员，也同样两天一夜喝不上水，吃不上饭了。部队在经受着考验，坚持着守备。十八日，最艰难的日子里，排长刘月勇最挂心的是伤员们、战士们的饥渴。于是，他挺身而出，对大家说：“同志们，我是共产党员，我们是党领导下的中国人民志愿军。在我们面前，没有克服不了的困难。我们还要坚持战斗，我们还要活！谁是共产党员，青年团员，站出来！我们到敌人那里抢水去！”立刻，十几个党员团员，一齐出来站队。所有伤员们，所有战士们，都不由自主地一齐高呼：共产党万岁！共产党万岁！这个时候，一个小鬼，名叫莫邱，他啼哭了，他说：“我不是党员，又不是团员，我就不能去呀？我就不能立功吗？”刘月勇又对大家说：“同志们，凡是报了名的，都是好的。我们的革命，还没有最后胜利，繁重的任务，还在后头，让谁去，谁也不要过于兴奋，不批准谁去，谁也不要不高兴。”最后，只批准了他自己，另外一个青年团员，还有一个小鬼莫邱，一共三个人，每人带了八个水壶，排长刘月勇带领着，到敌人那边抢水去了！走出阵地，刘月勇问他们两个：“我们是什么任务？”他们回答：“抢水。”刘月勇立即纠正说：“不，我们是尖刀营，我们是尖刀任务，我们要记住营党委的号召，去完成任务！”他们三人，由板项里插入古月洞敌人阵地，抵达近敌人五十公尺的地方，看见敌人一个班正在山沟里，又是饼干，又是汽水，有吃有喝，又说又笑，刘月勇看得清楚，心里又愤恨又高兴。愤恨的是：敌人在这里，原来这么得意；高兴的是：一会敌人的一切全要变成我们的。他对身边的青年团员和小鬼说：“听我的命令，一起开火，一起打手榴弹！”接着他们就一下每人打过去两个手榴弹。手榴弹刚炸，枪又一齐打过去。手榴弹一响，枪一响，当场敌人死了四个，伤了七个，还有一个吓得跪在那里，双手举起，嘴里的面包，也咽不下去了。一霎时，战斗结束，缴机枪一挺，卡宾枪四支，自动步枪六支。三个人带来的水壶，全灌满了水，回去了。刘月勇三个人出来以后，可把连长风常元担心坏了，听到前面有枪响，有手榴弹响，打得很紧，以为三个人完了。于是派了一个班打算去救。这个班刚要去，刘月勇三个已经胜利归来了。刘月勇一上去就先请连长喝水，连长高兴极了，但不喝水。他说：“这水是你们用生命换来的，我不能先喝，你先让伤员同志们喝吧！”伤员们，战士们，看见有汽水，又有面包，高兴极了，高喊：“共产党万岁，刘月勇万岁！”水是先让伤员们喝了。后来因为人多水少，刘月勇向战士们提出三口水过关，每人只能喝水三口。日子愈艰难，我们愈团结，每人只喝了两口，都自动省下一口来，总共省下十一壶水。大家讨论决定：十一壶水保存起来，全部留给伤员们喝。最后，在阵地上举行了庆功会，伤员们，战士们为刘月勇庆功。庆功会上，把刘月勇高举起来，欢呼着：“抢水的功臣万岁！”他们就是这样战胜着困难，坚持着守备。先后把一百多名敌人消灭在阵地的前沿。
    （五）
    十八日，在大水洞我们的营完成了尖刀任务，战士们经过三天两夜的激烈战斗，已经是十分疲劳了，倒地便睡着了。正在这个时候，美军陆战第一师四个团的兵力增援上来，向北进犯了。北面的敌人两个团，又企图向南突围，我们已经面对着敌人六个团的兵力。团里给了我们阻击敌人的任务。营党委发出紧急号召，紧急动员起来，为痛击冒险北犯之敌保卫大水洞的胜利果实而奋斗！人在阵地在，寸土必守！我对排长史登英说：“考验你的时候到了！”史登英说：“任务越艰苦，越光荣！”后来他带着十二位勇士，坚守山头。这是保证我们阻击战胜利的关键。开始，敌人二、三百人，不讲究队形，迎面冲了上来，给十二勇士狠狠地打下去了。这一下，打得敌人一两个钟头都整顿不起队伍，不敢冲锋。史登英争取了空隙时间，领导了战士们添修工事，防备敌人的三面进攻。史登英对战士十分爱惜，他把祖国送来的食品，一个一个亲自送到每个战士的防炮洞里去。接着，敌人十七架飞机、七辆坦克、十多门炮，掩护着步兵，又向山头冲过来了。飞机投下来的，又是燃烧弹，又是汽油筒，山头全着了火。敌人一次接连一次地进攻。可是，我们的十二位勇士，愈是困难的时候，就愈去想办法消灭敌人，保存自己，敌变我变，敌人狡猾，我们灵活。从中午十二时到下午五时，打了半天，总是我们打住敌人，敌人打不住我们。接连打退了敌人的四次冲锋，一次反击。在这个战斗中，敌人死伤一百多，我无一伤亡。十二勇士在，山头也在！
    同一天，由北向南突围的又一部敌人，从背后窜到我们的营部来了，我们各连都在前面担负着繁重的任务。可是，敌人的飞机，投着燃烧弹，汽油筒，掩护着他们的部队，向营部进攻了。在这个时候，到我们营里来的副团长，镇静地说：“要把敌人想办法打下去！”我们都想着，要主动出击，打击敌人。我对同志们说：“为祖国的人民立功的时候到了，在这个时候，我们要组织英雄队，谁自动报名参加，举手站出来！”立即三十二个拳头举了起来了，三十二个人站出来了，他们是我们营里的卫生员、担架员、炊事员、文化教员、通讯员、司号员、理发员。他们谁也知道，在这个时候，要做些什么事。外勤通讯员陈振东，最近收到他的母亲一张照片和一封信，信上说：“别忘记我为什么断了一只胳膊。”陈振东没有忘记，现在他站到英雄队里面来了。内勤通讯员小田说：“现在用不着内勤了，我也参加英雄队去！”三十二个人，临时分做四个班，编成一个队。炮兵排排长杨景行也来报名参加，当了英雄队队长。他们手里都端着枪，看到营教导员挺起身子打机枪，压住了敌人的火力，听到冲锋号响，就从四面出击了，向距离我们阵地不到五十公尺的敌人扑去了！就这样，以攻为守，打垮了敌人一个连的进攻。敌人的连长，被我们的炊事班长活捉来了。陈振东也没有落空，他自己缴到敌人的卡宾枪一支，自动步枪一支，活捉美国兵一名。这次，总共活捉敌人十八名，打死打伤敌人八十多名，缴获轻重机枪各一挺、卡宾枪四支、自动步枪六支。英雄队人人记了功。
    （六）
    十九日，为了重新控制五三五高地，掩护部队的主动转移，我们把美军陆战第一师的一个连，全部彻底歼灭在高地上面。这是我们这次阻击战中的最后一战！我们接受的这个任务，是艰巨的。这个时候，只要有任务，战士们就仍然不顾疲劳，自动表示态度，坚决执行任务！连向营表示了态度，营向团表示了态度，坚决执行这个任务。同时，我们执行这个任务是要以少胜多，要勇敢要灵活。当十九日天明前，我们正面攻击部队抵近敌人二百公尺，迂回侧击部队抵达近敌人六十公尺的时候，又骄傲又麻痹的敌人还在做梦。等到敌人发觉，我们正面的部队已经发起攻击，敌人被迫只好从阵地出来，仓皇应战。敌人的连长在阵地上架起望远镜指挥。正在这个时候，我们的迂回侧击部队，又已经从敌人的背后六十公尺的地方突然出现，占领了敌人的阵地，活捉了敌人的连长。走出阵地仓皇应战的敌人，正要转过身来应付我们的迂回侧击部队时，才知道他们的阵地已经失守，他们的连长已成了俘虏。我们正从阵地上，居高临下，射击他们。归路已经断了的敌人，就想往南逃窜。可是，当敌人正在犹豫时，我们的重武器火力，早已超越射击一百五十公尺之外，把敌人拦腰截住。就这样，敌人一个连，全部被消灭！我们就这样出敌不意，抵近敌人，又调动敌人，消灭敌人于敌人的阵地外面。就这样，我们以少胜多，以伤亡六人的代价，消灭敌人一个整连。
    为什么我们的部队竟能以少数的兵力和普通的装备，打败了武装到牙齿的美帝国主义的多数的侵略军呢？不错，美帝国主义确实是帝国主义之王，拥有现代化的装备，疯狂、残暴、又狡猾。但是，他们所进行的战争是非正义的，他们只是为华尔街少数金融资本家当炮灰，所以他们的部队怯懦、腐败、下流无耻，所以不管美帝国主义如何吹嘘什么“海空优势”，也免不掉被我们消灭；而且，最后必然彻底失败。而我们，拿我们这个营来说吧，不过是朝鲜战场上中国人民志愿军普通的一营，在朝鲜战场上，有着像我们这样的许许多多的营，都是这样英勇地作战，消灭敌人。这是因为我们是人民的军队，是在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党领导和教养下的中国人民所组成的部队，我们部队中有着党的坚强领导，有着无数的像陶金山、刘月勇式的共产党员发挥着自己先进的作用，因而能够克服一切困难，打败强大的敌人，而永远不可被战胜！
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上，已经遭受了严重打击，但它仍无悔祸之心，狂妄地准备继续扩大侵略战争。最近它再三破坏朝鲜和平谈判的事实，就足够地证明了这一点。现在，美帝国主义又操纵旧金山会议签订单独对日和约，这当然是非法的和无效的。我们是热爱和平的，为了争取和平，我们坚决地反对侵略战争。如果美帝国主义仍敢于如此放肆地继续扩大侵略战争，必将继续遭受更严重的打击！战争的形势，对于敌人不会是美妙的，最后胜利一定属于中、朝人民！
