    Letter from Zhangjiakou Trust Company
    Explaining High-Price Leather Purchase
To the Editorial Department:

    We have read the letter from readers Li Yingqi and Zhang Jingru published in the People's Daily's Readers' Letters column on July 10th, criticizing the "Northeast Railway Department and Harbin Garment Factory for purchasing large quantities of leather in Zhangjiakou, causing chaos in local leather prices." Our company did purchase 900 sheepskins on June 9th on behalf of the Harbin Trust Company's Fur Department and the Qiqihar Native Produce Company, at a price of 61,500 yuan per piece. At the time, our company noticed that this purchase price exceeded the stipulated price of the Livestock Products Company and believed that this would cause fluctuations in market leather prices. Therefore, on the same day that these 900 skins were purchased, the procurement personnel were notified to stop purchasing. In the future, we will strengthen our ties with the Livestock Products Company to unify our steps and jointly ensure the completion of military procurement tasks.

    Furthermore, on July 10th, our company received a letter from the Materials Department of the Ministry of Railways' Northeast Special Commissioner's Office, requesting our company to purchase 7,000 leather overcoats. Our company immediately, under the supervision of the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, negotiated with the crude leather industry and signed a contract to purchase 6,300 leather overcoats. The purchase of this leather did not affect the market price. On July 21st, our company received the regulations on leather management forwarded by the Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, and on the 24th, we sent personnel to the original ordering unit in the Northeast to negotiate, requesting the cancellation of the original contract. On August 17th, we received a reply from the original ordering unit, who believed that this leather overcoat contract was established before the government implemented leather control and should not be cancelled. At that time, we immediately reported the matter to the higher-level management authority for verification and instruction, and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government instructed the Chahar Provincial Department of Commerce to be responsible for resolving the matter.

### 张家口信托公司来信  说明高价代购皮革经过

    张家口信托公司来信
    说明高价代购皮革经过编辑同志：
    我们已经读了七月十日人民日报读者来信栏发表的读者李颖奇、张静如批评“东北铁路部门及哈尔滨被服厂在张家口大量收购皮革，引起了当地皮价的混乱”的来信。本公司确曾于六月九日代哈尔滨信托公司皮毛部及齐齐哈尔土产公司买进绵羊皮九百张，每张价六万一千五百元。本公司当时查觉此项收购价格超过了畜产公司的规定价格，认为这样做就会引起市场皮价的波动，所以在买好这九百张皮子的当天，即通知采购人员停止收购。今后我们一定加强与畜产公司的联系，以统一步调共同保证完成军需采购任务。
    又七月十日本公司接到铁道部驻东北特派员办事处材料部的公函，要求本公司代购皮大衣七千件，本公司当即在张家口市人民政府工商局监督之下，经过与粗皮业的协商，订定购置皮大衣六千三百件的合同。此项皮张的采购，对市价并未发生影响。七月二十一日，本公司接到市人民政府工商局转发之皮张管理规定，二十四日即派员到东北原订购单位办理交涉，要求废除原合同。八月十七日我们接到原订购单位的复信，他们认为此项皮大衣合同是在政府实行皮张管制以前成立，不应废除。当时，我们即将此事报告上级管理机关核示，并经中央人民政府贸易部指示察哈尔省商业厅负责解决中。
