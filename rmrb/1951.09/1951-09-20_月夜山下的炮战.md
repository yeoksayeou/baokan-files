	Artillery Battle Under the Moonlit Mountain
	Xiao Chi, Yu Lu

	In early July, a fierce artillery battle took place at Height 266 under Moonlit Mountain, north of Yeoncheon, where the enemy suffered a severe punishment from the heroic artillery of the Chinese People's Volunteers. This heroic artillery unit defeated an enemy ten times their number, and, in coordination with the infantry, killed or wounded more than 400 enemy soldiers, while sustaining only five casualties themselves. The leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteers issued a commendation order.

	On July 4th, American aggressor troops, supported by a column of tanks, launched a fierce attack from Yeoncheon against the right flank of the Height 266 hilltop position, attempting to outflank Height 266.

	The slogan of the artillery heroes was: "Support the infantry and annihilate the invading enemy!" Disregarding the fatigue from marching and building fortifications, they immediately went into battle. All cannons fired in unison, and artillery shells rained down like a hurricane on the enemy positions in Diancun. The enemy in Diancun were either driven into ditches or scattered in all directions, and the tanks, after running down into the paddy fields, spun around in fear. The gunners then turned their massive cannons toward another target – the rear of Dokgeum-ri Mountain. With a series of earth-shattering explosions, the enemy's vehicles and ammunition depots were engulfed in flames, and the artillery shells stored in the depots flew and exploded in all directions.

	The enemy concentrated their superior artillery to counterattack. Although the brave soldiers had not rested for seven days and nights, they cleverly changed their positions from time to time to evade the enemy's shells and bring their firepower to bear. As soon as they reached a new position, they suppressed the enemy's fire with a sudden barrage. The infantry comrades fighting on the front lines praised them as "cannon rollers."

	The enemy's attacks over the past four days had been smashed by our infantry and artillery's closely coordinated counterattacks. Enraged by the defeats, on July 8th, the enemy concentrated four artillery groups and four aircraft to specifically target our heroic artillery unit. At the same time, the enemy stealthily attacked the rear of Changgeo-ri Hill on the left side of Height 266 with two battalions of infantry, again attempting to outflank Height 266. All of the enemy's sneaky attempts could not escape the eyes of our artillery observation post. As soon as the enemy reached Changgeo-ri, the observers promptly reported the situation to the command post. As soon as the artillery commander put down the telephone after issuing orders, our artillery shells rained down like a storm on the heads of the enemy in Changgeo-ri.

	Enemy aircraft discovered our artillery location, and the enemy's long-range guns also fired in rapid succession. Under the intense fire of enemy aircraft and artillery, the brave gunners calmly and accurately returned fire. Gunner Yang Yongxin, a youth league member suffering from dysentery, had his clothes set on fire by a gasoline bomb. He rolled around in a ditch to put out the fire, and then rushed back to his position to continue firing. The squad leader wanted him to rest for a while, but he refused, saying, "Now is the time to fight, not the time to rest." Although some enemy shells landed around the artillery position, the surrounding trees were blasted leaving only a few bare trunks, and shrapnel rained down in wave after wave, the heroic gunners did not stop fighting, and they retaliated even more fiercely.

	The commander called to inquire about the situation on the position, and the young artillery company commander reported, "It's getting lively here, we haven't suffered any losses." Half an hour later, two enemy artillery groups were silenced, and the enemy in Changgeo-ri were smashed to pieces. The infantry cheered and leaped out of their positions, bravely attacking the enemy, and two battalions of the enemy were completely defeated. A fierce battle ended victoriously. The artillery company commander put down the telephone receiver, with a beaming smile on his face, and announced to the soldiers surrounding him: the higher-ups have awarded merit to all the artillery, and two cannons have been awarded great merit.

    月夜山下的炮战
    肖池、予鲁
    七月初旬，涟川以北月夜山下二六六高地发生了一场炮战，敌人遭受到了志愿军英勇炮兵的痛惩。这一支英雄的炮兵战胜了在数量上十倍于己的敌人，配合步兵杀伤敌人四百多名，自己仅负伤五人。因而志愿军领导机关曾通令嘉奖。
    七月四日，美国侵略军从涟川出动了一队坦克，掩护步兵猛犯二六六高地右侧的山头阵地，妄图从那里侧击二六六高地。
    炮兵勇士们的口号是：“支援步兵痛歼犯敌！”他们不顾行军和构筑阵地的疲劳，立即投入了战斗。各炮齐鸣，炮弹像刮大风样的倾泻到店村敌人的阵地。店村的敌人被打得有的钻进水沟，有的四处乱窜，坦克跑下稻田吓得打转转。炮手们又将巨大的炮口转向另一目标——读琴里山后，随着轰然的爆裂声，敌人的汽车和弹药库燃起了熊熊烈火，贮藏在库里的炮弹四处飞炸。
    敌人集中了在数量上占优势的大炮进行迎击。勇士们虽然已经七昼夜没有得到休息，但他们为使敌人炮弹落空和使自己能发扬火力，就不时机智地变换着自己的阵地。他们一到新阵地，就用突然的猛射制压住敌人的炮火。在前沿战斗的步兵战友们称赞他们是“碾炮”。
    敌人四天来的进攻都被我步、炮兵紧密协同的反击战所粉碎了。被打得恼羞成怒的敌人，在七月八日集中了四个炮兵群和四架飞机，专门来寻找我军这一支英勇炮队。同时，敌人以两个营的步兵偷袭二六六高地左侧场巨里小山的背后，又企图侧攻二六六高地。敌人这一切鬼祟的企图逃不出我炮兵观测所的眼睛。当敌人一到场巨里，观测员就及时地将情况报告了指挥所。炮兵指挥员才放下下达命令的电话筒，我们的炮弹就又像大雨似地倾泻在场巨里敌人的头上。
    敌机发现了我炮兵所在，敌人的远射程炮也连珠似地打过来。在敌机敌炮密集火力射击下，英勇的炮手们沉着而准确地还击着。患着痢疾的炮手、青年团员杨永信的衣服沾上了汽油弹液起火了，他跑进水沟滚了两滚，火熄灭了，他又飞奔进入阵地坚持射击。班长要他休息一会，他拒绝了，他说：“现在是战斗的时候，不是休息的时候。”尽管炮兵阵地的周围落了一些敌人的炮弹，那里的大树炸得只剩下几根光秃秃的树干，弹片一阵又一阵地落下来，可是英雄的炮手们，并不因此而停止战斗，他们更加猛烈地还击着。
    指挥员打电话询问阵地上的情况，青年的炮兵连长报告说：“正热闹着呢，我们没有损失。”半小时后，两个敌人炮兵群被打成了哑吧，场巨里的敌人被打得稀烂。步兵们欢呼着跃出阵地，勇猛地向敌人出击，两个营的敌人被完全打垮了。一场激烈的战斗胜利结束了，炮兵连长放下了电话听筒，满脸堆笑地向围着他的战士们宣布：上级给全体炮兵记了功，还有两门炮记了大功。（新华社）
