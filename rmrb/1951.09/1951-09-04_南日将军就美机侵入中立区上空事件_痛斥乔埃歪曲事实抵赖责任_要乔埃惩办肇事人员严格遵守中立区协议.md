Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd: General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation, today sent Joye a reply to his response of September 2nd, which reads in full as follows:

To Vice Admiral Joye, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

I have received your reply of September 2nd to my protest of August 30th regarding your military aircraft violating the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement, intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace, and dropping flares. Your reply is a complete distortion of the facts and denial of responsibility, and is therefore unsatisfactory. You stated that after receiving my protest, you immediately ordered an investigation into whether your military aircraft had dropped flares in the Kaesong Neutral Zone, and that the investigation allegedly found no such occurrence. You are precisely using this trick to deny that your military aircraft intruded into the neutral zone to drop flares, thereby shirking the responsibility you should bear. I must point out that your so-called investigation is nothing but a ridiculous charade of deceiving yourself and others. You admitted that on August 29th at 2:40 AM, your military aircraft had dropped flash bombs near the Kaesong Neutral Zone, and you think this can prove that the aircraft that flew into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace to drop flares was not your military aircraft. In fact, the fact you admitted precisely proves that your military aircraft dropped the flare. Because according to the fact you admitted, only your military aircraft was operating in the airspace near Kaesong at that time, then the flare that the residents of Kaesong personally witnessed being dropped in the neutral zone could not have been dropped by any aircraft other than yours.

You say that you and I have not reached an agreement on the neutralization of the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, in order to defend the "legality" of your military aircraft's intrusion into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace. You should not forget, when you say this, that your superior, General Ridgway, in his letter to Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai on July 13th, proposed: "During the entire period of our meetings, both sides agree not to engage in any kind of hostile actions within the neutral zone." In fact, the basic content of the Kaesong neutralization is that both you and I agree not to engage in any kind of hostile actions within the Kaesong Neutral Zone. According to international practice, everyone knows that so-called hostile actions refer to any kind of hostile actions conducted by all armed forces, and your air force's patrol and reconnaissance activities in the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace are even more obvious hostile actions and should be stopped. Based on this only possible understanding, which is in accordance with international practice and leaves no room for misunderstanding, that both sides cease all hostile actions, Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai agreed on July 14th to General Ridgway's proposal regarding the Kaesong neutralization. Once this agreement was reached, any action by your military aircraft intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace constitutes a violation of the agreement and is therefore illegal. However, the illegal actions of your military aircraft intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace have never stopped since July 15th. It was only when your military aircraft continuously violated the Neutral Zone Agreement, frequently and illegally intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace without any sign of stopping, making it difficult for our side to tolerate any longer, that our liaison officer called your attention to this fact on August 13th and proposed to your liaison officer that specific regulations be made for the neutralization of the airspace over Kaesong, so that you would pay attention to abiding by them. It can be seen from this that this is not a new agreement, but only a specific regulation that needs to be clarified because your side has failed to strictly abide by the Neutralization Agreement. If your side had strictly abided by the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement initially proposed by General Ridgway and agreed to by our side from the beginning, this specific regulation would not have been necessary at all. Now, not only do you not admit that your military aircraft's intrusion into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace after July 15th was illegal, but you also do not admit that after your liaison officer clearly agreed on August 16th that the airspace over Kaesong should be neutralized, your military aircraft's continued intrusion into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace was even more consciously illegal. Instead, you use the excuse that this specific regulation has not yet been approved by the delegation to prove that the fact that your military aircraft have been continuously intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace since July 15th is legal, in order to shirk your responsibility for consistently violating the Neutral Zone Agreement. This proves that you have had no intention of abiding by the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement proposed by your side from the beginning. Not only that, since you believe that this hostile action of your military aircraft illegally intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace is legal, then it is a natural development to move from this hostile action of your military aircraft intruding into the Kaesong airspace to another hostile action of your military aircraft bombing the Kaesong Neutral Zone. In fact, your persistent refusal to include your air force's activities within the scope of prohibited hostile actions cannot but make people suspect that you are intentionally using the threat of your air force against the Kaesong Neutral Zone, including bombing, as a tool to exert pressure on the Kaesong negotiations. The series of events on August 22nd, August 29th, and September 1st are the inevitable and logical development of your absurd policy of actually requiring our side to cease all hostile actions in the Kaesong Neutral Zone, but reserving the freedom for your air force to continue hostile actions. All the excuses you make to defend your military aircraft's illegal activities of dropping flares and continuously intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace are untenable. I once again demand that you severely punish the culprits, and thoroughly guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again, and your complete and strict compliance with the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement.

    南日将军就美机侵入中立区上空事件
    痛斥乔埃歪曲事实抵赖责任
    要乔埃惩办肇事人员严格遵守中立区协议
   【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军本日向乔埃送出对他的九月二日的复文的答复，其全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃海军中将：
    我已收到你九月二日对于我八月三十日抗议你方军用飞机破坏开城中立区协议，侵入开城中立区上空并投掷照明弹的复文。你的复文是完全歪曲事实与抵赖责任的，因而是不能满意的。你说你方在接到我的抗议以后，即曾下命调查有无你方军用飞机在开城中立区投掷照明弹，据说调查结果是没有。你恰巧利用这种伎俩，来否认你方军用飞机侵入中立区投掷照明弹，从而推卸你方应负的责任。我必须指出你这种所谓调查，完全是一种欺人自欺的可笑的儿戏。你承认了八月二十九日二时四十分你方军用飞机曾在开城中立区附近投掷闪光弹，你以为这就可以证明飞来开城中立区上空投掷照明弹的，不是你方军用飞机。其实你所承认的事实，正好证明是你方的军用飞机投掷了这个照明弹。因为根据你所承认的事实，那时只有你方军用飞机在开城附近上空活动，那么开城市居民所亲眼看见的投在中立区的照明弹，就不可能不是你方军用飞机投的。
    你为了辩护你方军用飞机侵入开城中立区上空的“合法”，你说：你我之间并未达成关于开城中立区上空中立化的协议，你在说这话的时候，不应该忘记你的上司李奇微将军在七月十三日致金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员的信中，曾经提议过：“在我们的会议的整个时期中，双方同意在中立区内不作任何种类的敌对行动”。事实上开城中立化的基本内容，也就是你我双方同意在开城中立区内不作任何种类的敌对行动。根据国际惯例，谁都知道所谓敌对行动，是指所有武装力量所进行的任何种类的敌对行动的，而你方空军在开城中立区上空，进行巡逻侦察活动，更是一种明显的敌对行动，应该予以停止。金日成最高司令官和彭德怀司令员是根据这个依照国际惯例不容误解的对于双方停止一切敌对行动的唯一可能的理解，于七月十四日同意了李奇微将军关于开城中立化的建议。这个协议一经达成，你方军用飞机任何侵入开城中立区上空的行动，就是破坏协议的，因而是非法的。但你方军用飞机侵入开城中立区上空的非法行动，从七月十五日起一直未曾停止。只是当你方军用飞机不断破坏中立区协议，经常非法侵入开城中立区上空，而无任何停止的迹象，使我方难于再忍耐下去的时候，我方联络官才于八月十三日提起你方对于这一事实的注意。并向你方联络官提议，对开城区上空中立化作出具体规定，以便你方注意遵守。从此可见这不是一个什么新的协议，而只是因为你方未能严格遵守中立化协议，而才有需要加以明确化的一种具体规定。假使你方一开始就严格遵守最初为李奇微将军所建议而为我方所同意的关于开城中立化的协议，这个具体规定是根本不需要的。现在你不仅既不承认七月十五日以后你方军用飞机侵入开城中立区上空就是非法的，也不承认八月十六日你方联络官明确同意了开城上空应该中立化的具体规定之后，你方军用飞机仍然侵入开城中立区上空，更是有意识地非法的，反而藉口这项具体规定尚未得到代表团的批准，来证明七月十五日以来你方军用飞机不断侵入开城中立区上空的事实，都是合法的，以推诿你方一贯破坏中立区协议的责任。这就证明你自始就无意于遵守你方所提出的开城中立化的协议。不仅如此，你既然认为你方军用飞机非法侵入开城中立区上空这一敌对行动是合法的，那么，从你方军用飞机侵入开城上空这个敌对行动，走到你方军用飞机轰炸开城中立区的另一个敌对行动，就是自然的发展。其实，你方如此执拗地拒绝将你方空军的活动列入被禁止的敌对行动的范围之内，不能不使人怀疑你方是在有意地使用你方空军对开城中立区的威胁，包含轰炸在内，作为对开城谈判施行压力的一个工具。八月二十二日、八月二十九日、九月一日一系列的事件，乃是你方实际上要求我方在开城中立区停止一切敌对行动，但却为你方空军保留继续进行敌对行动自由的荒谬政策之必然的逻辑的发展。你所有为你方军用飞机在开城中立区上空投掷照明弹，及不断侵入开城中立区上空的非法活动作辩护的藉口，都是站不住的。我再度要求你严惩肇事人员，并澈底保证类似事件不再发生，和你方对开城中立化协议的全部和严格的遵守。
  	朝鲜人民军中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军		一九五一年九月三日
