    Declaration of the Founding of the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee

    We, the Beijing Catholic Reform Committee, are now officially established! From this day forward, the Catholics of Beijing are truly liberated from the clutches of imperialism! All the conspiracies of the imperialist elements and traitors, spies, and despots entrenched within our Church have been shattered.

    Before the liberation of Beijing, those imperialist elements, traitors, spies, and despots unscrupulously spread rumors, saying, "Where there is the Communist Party, there is no Catholicism; where there is Catholicism, there is no Communist Party." Today, every true believer can see that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government led by Chairman Mao have not only not banned Catholicism, but have also not interfered with our religious beliefs and all religious rituals. "Freedom of religious belief" is not only clearly stipulated in Article 5 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but is also implemented without any discounts. For more than two years since the liberation of Beijing, we Catholics have been freely conducting all religious activities without any hindrance. The ironclad facts of the People's Government's protection of religious freedom have step by step shattered all the imperialist elements and special agent spies' attempts to sow discord and spread rumors, eliminating our various concerns. Looking back, our Church was controlled by imperialist elements such as Libère, Tian Gengxin, and Yu Bin. They abused divine authority, used it as a pretext, and used the Church's organization and believers to do things against the people and against the motherland. This is well known. At that time, under their deception and coercion, Catholics could only forget the freedom of their motherland, and had no freedom to love their motherland and their people; they only had the freedom to serve imperialist elements, and no freedom to serve the people and the vast number of believers. Catholics, compatriots, this is the "freedom of religious belief" that imperialist elements and their running dogs talk about!

    In the recent accusation meetings, the Catholics of Beijing have slightly exposed that a large number of demons and Satans are hidden in our Church, that is, those special agents, despots, traitors, bandits, and hooligans who are cloaked in religious garb and bear the banner of charity. They ride on the heads of the believers, blindfold their eyes, and are licentious, shameless, and do all kinds of evil. For example, Ma Di'e, the former "Representative of the Roman Curia's Envoy Libère stationed in Beijing," not only used Church connections to gather intelligence for Japanese and American invaders, but also participated in armed rebellion conspiracies. The imperialist elements of "Ren Ci Tang" (Convent of the Sisters of Charity) took advantage of the poverty of the people in the old society, and in the name of "charity," exploited the labor of children to provide for their luxurious lives. This exploitation was so inhumane and violated the will of God. According to the materials accused by only three Catholics, more than two thousand infants and young children were abused to death. Most infuriatingly, those hateful imperialist elements actually covered patients who had not yet breathed their last in coffins. At that time, the patients were still calling "Mama" inside! Li Dejing, the despot and special agent who seized the Changxindian Church, not only colluded with the rulers and imperialist forces of the time in the identity of a priest before liberation, seized and raped the family members of Catholics, and beat Catholics and students, but also hid weapons and provoked the relationship between Catholics and the People's Government after liberation. The local people and Catholics all hated him to the core. In addition, priests such as Li Shijia (German) and Du Huating, relying on imperialist elements, actually committed bestial acts such as adultery and sodomy, as well as crimes such as seizing Catholic land, stealing Church property, and exploiting Catholics.

    Catholics! These sinful facts fully prove that these imperialist elements and traitors, spies, and despots are not devout believers or messengers of the Lord, but devils who control the Church and use the Church to oppose the Chinese people, oppose our motherland, and betray the teachings of the Church.

    This is the shame of our Church, the shame of each of our Catholics. In the past, we were deceived and coerced; today, we are liberated and suddenly awakened. Although imperialist elements are still doing everything possible to interfere with our freedom of religious belief, undermine and obstruct our reform movement, and prevent Chinese Catholicism from becoming a true religious undertaking, they use divine authority to scare us with "going to hell" and "stopping divine work," and describe our reform movement to expel imperialist elements as "schism" and "apostasy"; the "Legion of Mary" ("Legion of Mary Immaculate"), which they organized, carries out planned sabotage activities against the reform movement, creates various reactionary rumors, and interferes with the freedom of Catholics to participate in social activities; however, since liberation, the great achievements of New China's construction in various fields, especially the sincere protection of religious freedom by the People's Government, have greatly stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm of our vast number of Catholics, and imperialist elements and their running dogs can no longer suppress this enthusiasm. We already have our own people's country. The facts have opened our eyes and allowed us to see the light again. Ma Di'e's ferocious face, the cries and dirges of "Ren Ci Tang," and the anger and accusations of Catholics are all before our eyes and in our ears. We have seen the horrors of imperialist elements, traitors, spies, and despots; and we have also seen the loveliness of New China. We Chinese Catholics are Chinese, we are devout Catholics, and we are also lovers of the motherland; all of us Catholics must unite and continue to persevere in completing our reform movement, thoroughly severing the connection between Chinese Catholicism and imperialist elements, and eliminating the imperialist elements and traitors, spies, and despots within our Church. Only in this way can we be worthy of the glorious Chinese people, and only then can we be worthy of being Chinese Catholics.

    Compatriots and Catholic brothers and sisters across the country! We thank Chairman Mao! With his great leadership, China has been liberated, our Catholicism has been able to embark on the road of reform, and we have gained the guarantee of freedom of belief. With incomparable excitement, we express to compatriots across the country and all Catholics: We must, together with you, firmly support the Central People's Government, support the Common Program, and under the leadership of the People's Government and Chairman Mao, contribute everything we have to building a free and happy New China.

### 北京市天主教革新委员会成立宣言

    北京市天主教革新委员会成立宣言
    我们北京市的天主教革新委员会，现在正式成立了。从此我们北京市天主教的教友才真正从帝国主义的魔爪下解放出来了！盘踞在我们教内的一切帝国主义分子和汉奸、特务、恶霸们的各种阴谋诡计都被粉碎了。
    北京解放前，那些帝国主义分子、汉奸、特务、恶霸们就大肆造谣说：“有共产党存在，就没有天主教；有天主教就没有共产党存在。”今天，每一个真正的教徒，谁都能看到中国共产党和毛主席所领导的人民政府不但没有取缔天主教，更没有干涉我们的宗教信仰和一切宗教仪式。关于“宗教信仰自由”，不但在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第五条上明确规定了；并且是毫不折扣地实行了。北京解放后二年多以来，我们教友们一直是自由自在地进行一切宗教活动，毫未受到阻碍。人民政府保障宗教信仰自由的铁的事实，一步一步地粉碎了一切帝国主义分子和特务间谍们的挑拨离间和造谣，消除了我们的各种顾虑。回顾过去，我们的教会被帝国主义分子黎培里、田耕莘、于斌等把持着。他们滥用神权，假借神权，利用教会的组织，利用教友们为他们作反人民反祖国的事，这是人所共知的。那时，在他们的欺骗劫持之下，教友们只有忘记自己祖国的自由，没有爱祖国爱人民的自由；只有为帝国主义分子服务的自由，没有为人民为广大教友服务的自由。教友们，同胞们，这就是帝国主义分子及其走狗们所说的“宗教信仰自由”！
    我们北京市的教友们在最近的控诉会中，略加揭露，就发现在我们教内藏有大批魔鬼、撒旦，就是那些披着宗教的外衣，挂着慈善的招牌的特务、恶霸、汉奸、土匪、流氓。他们骑在教友们的头上，蒙着教友们的眼睛，荒淫无耻，无恶不作。如：前
    “罗马教廷公使黎培里驻北京代表”马迪懦，不但利用教会的关系刺探情报供给日本和美国侵略者，而且参加武装暴动的阴谋。“仁慈堂”的帝国主义分子利用旧社会人民的贫穷，以“仁慈”为名，剥削孩子们的劳动来供给她们的奢华生活。这种剥削是如此惨无人道，违背天主的意旨。仅据三个教友控诉出来的材料，就有两千多婴儿幼童被虐待死了。最令人发指的是那些可恶的帝国主义分子，竟将没有断气的病人盖到棺材里去，那时，病人还在里面叫“妈妈”呢！窃据长辛店教堂的恶霸、特务李德镜，不但在解放以前曾以神甫身份勾结当时的统治者和帝国主义势力，霸占奸淫教友眷属，毒打教友和学生，而且在解放后又私藏军火并挑拨教徒和人民政府的关系，当地人民和教友莫不恨之入骨。此外，李士嘉（德籍）、杜华庭等神甫，依靠帝国主义分子，竟做出奸淫、鸡奸之类的兽行以及霸占教友土地、盗卖教产、剥削教徒等罪恶行为。
    教友们！这些罪恶事实都充分证明：这些帝国主义分子和汉奸、特务、恶霸们，并不是什么虔诚的教徒或主的使者，乃是控制教会和利用教会反对中国人民、反对我们祖国的、背叛教义的魔鬼。
    这是我们教会的耻辱，这是我们每个教友的耻辱。过去我们受欺骗劫持；今天我们解放了，恍然大悟了。虽然帝国主义分子还是千方百计地来干涉我们的宗教信仰的自由，破坏和阻挠我们的革新运动，不让中国天主教成为真正的宗教事业；他们假借神权用“下地狱”、“停神功”等来恐吓我们，把我们驱逐帝国主义分子的革新运动说成是“裂教”、
    “背教”行为；他们组织的“圣母军”（“圣母慈爱祈祷会”）更对革新运动进行有计划的破坏活动，造出种种反动谣言，干涉教友参加社会活动的自由；可是解放以来，新中国建设在各方面的伟大成就，特别是人民政府对于宗教信仰自由的真诚保护，大大激发了我们广大教友的爱国热情，帝国主义分子及其走狗们再也不能把这种热情压制下去了。我们已经有我们人民自己的国家了。事实拨开了我们的眼睛，使我们重见光明。马迪懦的狰狞面目，“仁慈堂”的哭声和悲歌，教友们的愤怒和控诉，都在我们面前和耳旁。我们已经看到了帝国主义分子、汉奸、特务、恶霸的可怕；也看到了新中国的可爱。我们中国天主教徒是中国人，我们是虔诚的天主教徒，我们也是祖国的热爱者；我们全体教徒一定要团结起来，继续坚持完成我们的革新运动，澈底割断中国天主教和帝国主义分子的联系，清除我们教内的帝国主义分子和汉奸、特务、恶霸分子。只有这样，我们才不愧为光荣的中国人民，才不愧为中国的天主教徒。
    全国同胞和天主教教友们！我们感谢毛主席！有了他的伟大领导，我们中国才得到了解放，我们天主教才得以走上革新之路，我们才获得了信仰自由的保障。我们以无比兴奋的心情向全国同胞全体教友表示：我们一定要和你们一道，坚决拥护中央人民政府，拥护共同纲领，在人民政府和毛主席的领导下，为建设自由幸福的新中国而贡献我们的一切。
