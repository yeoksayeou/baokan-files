How We Learn and Master Technology in the Huai River Project
By Qian Zhengying, Deputy Director of the Engineering Department of the Huai River Harnessing Committee

In the Huai River project, the task of our technical workers is to ensure that the planning, design, and construction of the Huai River project accurately reflect Chairman Mao's great political call. Because old China never completed the fundamental治理of a single river, no matter what work experience our engineering personnel had in the past or what school education they received, they cannot provide a relatively complete set of knowledge for this fundamental治理 of the Huai River. Many of our technical workers are still influenced to varying degrees by the dogmatism given by the old education, and there are still phenomena of being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses in their work and study. This makes it impossible for the limited knowledge learned to be correctly and fully utilized in the work. Over the past year, we have experienced a difficult and tortuous road of learning, and there have been many shortcomings and errors in technology, and we have encountered many difficulties and losses in our work; but we have also gained certain exercises and improvements, and we have also explored the road to continue to move forward. Now, taking the planning, design, and construction of the Runheji Diversion Sluice in the Huaihe River midstream flood control project as an example, we will illustrate the path we have taken in learning and mastering technology in actual work.

I. Two Plannings

The basic reason for the frequent floods in the old Huai River, in terms of the river itself, is improper storage and drainage. Zhengyangguan is the general hub where the tributaries from the upper reaches converge into the middle reaches. Under the heavy rain conditions of 1950, the maximum flood flow that could be caused by the flood in Zhengyangguan was 12,000 cubic meters per second, while the maximum flow that the riverbed below Zhengyangguan could carry and discharge was 6,500 cubic meters per second. The difference in flow between the incoming water from the upper reaches and the flow that the river channel can accommodate is as high as 5,500 cubic meters per second. Above Zhengyangguan, there are eight lakes and depressions distributed on both banks, and the maximum water storage capacity can reach 7.2 billion cubic meters, which could have played a significant role in regulating the flow of the Huai River. However, whenever the flood first arrives from the upper reaches, the riverbed below Zhengyangguan is not full, and when the discharge can be increased, the flood rushes into the lakes and depressions prematurely, occupying the capacity that should be used for flood storage. When the flood peak arrives from the upper reaches, the riverbed in the middle reaches gradually fills up, and the discharge cannot be increased. The difference between the incoming water and the outflow must find another way out. At this time, the water storage capacity of the lakes on both banks has also reached the saturation point, so the flood still overflows and breaks the dikes, causing disasters.

The central government stipulated that the middle reaches of the Huai River should transform the natural conditions of the old Huai River according to the principle of combining storage and drainage to solve the flood problem. In order to implement this policy, we have proposed two planning schemes.

The first time, we proposed to build strong dikes to separate the river channel from the main lakes (Huoqiu Chengxi Lake and Chengdong Lake), and build temporary grass dams (that is, earth dams with a layer of soil and a layer of grass) at the upper mouth of the lake. When the flood is too large, the dam is opened to divert water into the lake. According to this plan, only half-control of flood storage and drainage can be achieved, and Zhengyangguan and below still need to withstand a maximum flow of 8,500 cubic meters per second. Although this plan can slightly improve the natural conditions of the old Huai River, it still fails to completely solve the flood problem during the flood season. At that time, we had the following thoughts:

(1) To achieve complete control of storage and drainage, a series of large and complex sluices and dams must be built. However, these sluices and dams can never be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, only semi-controlled grass dams can be built.

(2) Sloppy thinking in technology. It is believed that bearing a flood flow of 8,500 cubic meters per second, although it fails to achieve the ideal solution to the problem, is an improvement compared to the past natural flood storage situation. As for whether the flow standard of 8,500 cubic meters per second is accurately estimated, and what impact it will have on Zhengyangguan and below, it has not been deeply investigated.

After Soviet expert Comrade Bukov came to help with the work, he raised a series of new questions and opinions.

First of all, he asked us to fully grasp the flood data and suggested using graphical methods to analyze the data at first. When the hydrological work comrades drew a complete set of graphs under his guidance, we ourselves questioned the original plan. Because the graphs showed that if the storage and drainage could be completely controlled, only 800 million cubic meters of "effective" flood storage would be needed to keep the maximum flow of Zhengyangguan from exceeding 8,500 cubic meters per second; if 5.5 billion cubic meters of effective flood storage could be obtained, the maximum flow of Zhengyangguan could be kept from exceeding 6,500 cubic meters per second. However, our original "semi-controlled" plan used a total flood storage of 7 billion cubic meters to reach the flow standard of 8,500 cubic meters per second.

Secondly, he taught us to try to find the simplest control project and seek the largest effective flood storage. After analyzing and studying each lake, each tributary, and each section of the riverbed, we realized that if we want all 7.2 billion cubic meters of total flood storage to be effectively controlled, we do need a series of sluices and dam projects; but if we use the favorable terrain of Runheji to build a large diversion sluice to control the river channel discharge and the inflow into the lake, then we can grasp the key control in the entire decentralized and complex situation. If we can further study the law of flood development and find ways to manipulate storage and drainage, then we can obtain the maximum flood storage benefit from this one building. Based on this understanding, after repeated discussions and repeated trials, we finally formulated the current Huaihe River midstream flood storage plan: using the Runheji Diversion Sluice, combined with the dikes separating the Huaihe River and the lakes, to control the effective flood storage of 5.5 billion cubic meters, so that the maximum flood flow of Zhengyangguan does not exceed 6,500 cubic meters per second.

Comrade Bukov encouraged us that although the huge modern sluice construction is difficult, we can find ways to simplify it technically. Based on the Soviet construction experience and the construction achievements of China in the year since liberation, he believes that it is possible for the Chinese people to complete this building with their own strength in a short period of time.

After considering these suggestions, the Huai River Harnessing Committee made a solemn decision: to adopt the engineering plan suggested by Comrade Bukov, and strive to complete it before this year's flood season, so as to take the initiative in fighting floods during this year's flood season.

II. No Foundation Piles [1]

The tradition of domestic water conservancy construction is to use pile foundations. The reasons for using pile foundations are: (1) The bearing capacity of the foundation soil is not sufficient for the weight of the building; (2) If the foundation soil is scoured by water flow, the building will still be supported by reliable foundation piles and will not collapse. The first item plays a decisive role in the above reasons.

In our current situation, using pile foundations has the following difficulties: (1) The timber for foundation piles is not easy to supply. If the Runheji Diversion Sluice uses pile foundations, it will require about 12,000 large piles of more than 10 meters in length. (2) The construction time is long. It is estimated that it will take at least three to four months to drive 12,000 piles for the Runheji Diversion Sluice, even if the speed is accelerated. In this way, it is absolutely impossible to complete it before the flood season.

Many engineering personnel have long known that American construction projects are accustomed to using pile foundations, while in Europe, there are already construction projects that do not use pile foundations. But in the past, no one dared to try not using pile foundations in China, and no one studied this issue.

Comrade Bukov introduced to us the new Soviet theory and experience on foundation engineering: (1) Pile foundations are harmful to buildings. It allows the foundation soil to be more easily eroded by underground seepage, causing the foundation to be hollowed out. Moreover, because it is not easy to measure and control the actual bearing capacity of the foundation piles, it often causes uneven settlement of buildings, resulting in cracks and other dangers.

(2) If the design method is improved, it is possible to design so that the total weight of the building does not exceed the safe bearing capacity of the foundation soil. He cited that many large buildings in the Soviet Union are directly supported on the foundation soil, and the situation is good.

We accepted his suggested method and decided that the entire construction of the Runheji Diversion Sluice would not use foundation piles.

The first difficulty encountered in the design work was that the structural design of each part of the diversion sluice needed to be changed to a new calculation method. Because it is necessary to make the resultant force acting on the building close to the midpoint of the foundation in various situations. Therefore, the structural style of each part cannot be simply followed by established rules, but needs to be flexibly configured. Sometimes, after calculating for two or three days, it is impossible to match it up, and it is almost thought that it is impossible to do without piles in this specific situation. However, the design work comrades were supported by high enthusiasm, and if they could not calculate it, they would find another way. After repeated trials, the technology gradually became proficient, and finally the preliminary design of each part of the structure was completed.

The second difficulty was encountering particularly bad soil. After the preliminary design was completed, it was found that the foundation soil of the fixed riverbed part of the diversion sluice was particularly bad, and the load-bearing capacity was not enough for the design regulations, and there were quicksand springs. The design work comrades had to redo the design urgently, and finally came up with a new clever method in the face of new difficulties. For example, after analyzing the structure of the fixed riverbed bank wall, it was calculated that part of the weight was added to prevent the building from sliding. Therefore, this part of the weight was reduced, and the sliding problem was solved with a slip resistance plate. The load was reduced to within the prescribed standard. The quicksand springs in the foundation soil may cause the danger of uneven settlement of the building. Comrade Bukov suggested that we excavate two meters of foundation soil and replace it with yellow sand as the foundation soil. We accepted his suggestion. At that time, the foundation of the diversion sluice was already three meters below the river water level, and the springs were gushing out like a tide, and the project was difficult. If we were to excavate two meters, the difficulty would be even greater, and some comrades had doubts about this. The workers answered this doubt with their heroic wisdom. The original plan was to complete the replacement of the foundation in ten days. Because the workers of the water pump strengthened the drainage work, the laborers also created the method of "changing pond excavation" to improve the efficiency of deep pond excavation [2], and completed the task ahead of schedule.

Under the above efforts, the entire building did not use a single foundation pile. Not using foundation piles does not rely on enlarging the foundation, but on improving the structural design and locally改造 the foundation soil. After the project was completed, after more than a month of measurement and inspection, each part of the structure only had slight settlement within the allowable range, and no adverse conditions such as uneven settlement of the building and cracks in the foundation were found. Facts have proved that not using foundation piles is safe and feasible. In our country's current situation of timber shortage, it is more worthy of widespread promotion.

III. No Sheet Piles [3]

One of the important keys that affect the safety of sluices is the treatment of underground seepage.

In the past design work, we were accustomed to using Bligh's or Lane's "theory" to estimate seepage and design sheet piles and foundations. However, in foreign and domestic books, and in university lectures, criticisms of Bligh's and Lane's theories have long been raised, the use of flow net method to estimate seepage effects has been proposed, it has been proposed that wooden sheet piles are not reliable, and there have been suggestions to use impermeable clay layers and inverted filters instead of sheet piles. As far as China's situation is concerned, sheet pile materials are very difficult, because wooden sheet piles need American yellow pine, and steel sheet piles are hardly available domestically.

Comrade Bukov suggested that we use impermeable clay layers and inverted filters instead of sheet piles. We accepted his suggestion. In the process of work, we encountered all kinds of questions and concerns. People feel that the old methods have been used for so many years, and they are always afraid that changing to a new one will not be safe. People asked, impermeable clay layers are useful, but we have no experience in this, can we make it impermeable? The joint between the impermeable clay layer and the concrete is stipulated to be lined with burlap with asphalt felt, but will the asphalt felt be cracked when making the clay? Can the joint be built to be impermeable? We accepted these opinions and tried to build this new project item with a cautious and meticulous attitude. Multiple tests were done before construction, clay samples were selected, and clay construction rules were set. After repeated research, the joint method of asphalt felt and concrete was stipulated. Regarding the question of whether the asphalt felt will be cracked, those who have seen the actual production situation are speechless. Because the asphalt felt made according to the design regulations is actually very thick and elastic, and not as easy to crack as oil paper. And the most fundamental thing is that the meticulous labor of the masses can answer all kinds of concerns.

Under the above efforts, the entire building of the diversion sluice did not use a single sheet pile. At the Runheji gate site, the source of clay is relatively difficult, and it needs to be transported from the other side of the Huaihe River. But we proposed: "Rather use domestic clay from across the river than American yellow pine from across the sea!" Because our leading cadres still lack experience, there are shortcomings in the construction layout of clay and inverted filters, which should be improved in the future. But this cannot affect the following conclusion at all: it is safe and feasible to use impermeable clay layers and inverted filters; in our country's current situation of sheet pile material shortage, it is more worthy of widespread promotion.

IV. Not Relying on Contracting

In the past, after the design work was completed, the engineering organization would contract the entire project to a construction company or construction factory. The construction was controlled by contractors at all levels, and the engineering organization was only responsible for supervision and inspection.

The Runheji Diversion Sluice project includes more than 24,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete project, more than 73,000 cubic meters of masonry project, 479 meters of gate installation project, and more than 200 cubic meters of earthwork. The entire project is required to be completed in less than four months of construction time. The task is so huge and the time is so pressing, how can we strive to complete it on schedule? The Huai River Harnessing Committee considered that the key to overcoming difficulties and completing the task is the combination of technology and the masses. Therefore, it was decided not to rely on contractors but to be directly organized by the Huai River Harnessing Committee to ensure completion.

We wholeheartedly accepted this wise decision of the superior and are determined to guarantee its implementation with all our efforts. Of course, there are difficulties. Among the engineering personnel, a few old engineers have handled many projects, but due to the limitations of the old contracting method, they still feel a lack of on-site experience. The vast majority of young engineering personnel, including myself, have never participated in a slightly larger sluice and dam project. But we realize that the key to the victory of the project is not here. The key is: we have the strong leadership of the superior, we have the people of the whole country as a strong rear, we have sound political work and supply work, the working masses are organized and conscious, and the cadres at all levels are loyal and devoted. These are construction conditions that contractors cannot possibly have. Although this project has its difficulties, it is bound to be overcome under the great construction spirit of the people. As for our individual technical conditions, we still remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The important thing is to learn."

We organized various workshops and various construction brigades. Engineering personnel went to the workshops to set out, arrange, and guide on their own, and served as captains in the construction brigades. Engineering personnel and workers learned from each other and worked together. Technical work is not only limited to drawing lines on paper, but also tested on the ground. We learn to master every delicate step of moving the project from paper to the ground, such as: clearing the foundation and setting the line, arranging the formwork wood support, how to build the scaffolding, how to tie the steel bars, studying the method of expansion joints, the labor combination and construction method of pouring concrete, the interweaving and coordination of various projects, the scheduling and distribution of manpower, and so on.

The actual results of the construction prove that only by directly handling it and not relying on contractors can we guarantee the quality and progress of the project, and can we guarantee the saving of materials and funds. It also proves that as long as we go into practice and go into the masses, technical wisdom can be greatly enriched. Only in this way can technology be considered to have landed on the ground instead of hanging in mid-air.

We unanimously agree to establish the direction of self-managed projects in the future. And it is suggested that, due to this new construction condition, and the excellent specifications of our existing materials (cement, yellow sand, gravel), we can require to increase the design safety compressive strength of concrete from 650 pounds per square inch to 800 pounds. This will enable the country to do more projects with the same resources. We propose and guarantee to complete this requirement in future projects, and believe that this is a manifestation of our patriotic spirit.

V. Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates
Our Technical Road

Over the past year, our learning has still not kept up with the needs of the development of work. This is because we are not good at mastering our own learning. There have been and still exist cognitive deviations in the learning problem. A small number of comrades hold on to their old ways, refuse to accept new things. They are either satisfied with their inherent experience or satisfied with book knowledge, and are unwilling to learn from practice and from the masses, and to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In this way, past qualifications and knowledge have become a burden to progress today. At a time when the motherland's construction is advancing rapidly and everyone is advancing rapidly, they cannot bravely keep up on the one hand, but on the other hand, they are beginning to feel the distress of falling behind. The vast majority of comrades deeply feel that their knowledge is insufficient and urgently need to learn, but they are troubled by not being able to grasp the correct learning path. Some recognize the advanced nature of Soviet technology, but in turn are distressed that they do not understand the Soviet language and have no way to learn. Some recognize the importance of facing reality and facing the masses, but lack correct work methods and learning methods. Although they have absorbed a lot of practical experience, they still cannot sort out and improve it. Some recognize the poverty of their technology, but in turn simply focus on technical learning, ignoring political learning, so that technical progress is limited to the learning of specific things and cannot be improved from basic positions, viewpoints, and methods.

But through various deviations and failures in work, I have gradually consciously embarked on the great road of technical progress - the great road illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and we did what he said and gained a lot. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us to value practice, and we did what he said and gained a lot. Thank you Comrade Mao Zedong, your "On Practice" was published last December, it is your "On Practice" that encourages and guides us to learn the planning, design, and construction of the Huai River project. From my personal experience, when participating in various technical debates, when encountering various technical problems, when welcoming critical project situations, when working with Chinese and foreign experts, when my work has shortcomings and errors, I often suffer from the immaturity of my political technology and feel unable to cope. At this time, I always remember Chairman Mao's political call to "be sure to repair the Huai River well", remember the development process of the cognitive movement taught to us in "On Practice", and remember that I should be a warrior armed with Mao Zedong Thought, so I strengthen myself and continue to learn and move forward in my work.

In summarizing the Huai River project over the past year, our own learning progress over the past year, and welcoming the glorious tasks for the coming year, we hereby issue heartfelt cheers: "Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our technical path. We must, under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, step up our transformation and move forward bravely!"

Appendix

[1] Foundation piles are wooden piles driven into the foundation soil of a building during construction to support the building.

[2] The soil excavated by the laborers that is lower than the water level is called a "deep pond." When excavating the soil, because there is underground water gushing out, the soil is excavated in sections. First, a deep place is excavated to allow the water to flow into the deeply excavated "pond," and then the soil is excavated where there is no water. This alternating excavation is called "changing pond excavation."

[3] Sheet piles are made of wood or steel and are built around or on top of the foundation soil to isolate the erosion of underground seepage. Building barriers with clay and eliminating seepage with inverted filters can eliminate the need for sheet piles. Clay barriers are "impermeable clay layers." When designing a project, the impact of underground seepage on the foundation soil is calculated, and the diagram drawn to calculate the diversion of the soil elsewhere has the shape of a network of lines, which is called the "flow net method."

    在治淮工程中我们怎样学习与掌握技术
    治淮委员会工程部副部长  钱正英
    在治淮工程中，我们技术工作者的任务，是使治淮工程的规划、设计和施工，都能确切地体现毛主席的伟大的政治号召。由于旧中国从未完成过一条河流的根本治理，所以不管过去我们工程人员有什么工作经验或受过什么学校教育，都不能对于这一次根治淮河提供一套比较完整的知识。我们许多技术工作者还在不同程度上有旧教育所给予的教条主义的影响，在工作与学习中仍有脱离实际、脱离群众的现象，这就使所学到的有限的知识也不能在工作中正确地、充分地发挥作用。一年来，我们经历了艰苦曲折的学习道路，在技术上发生过不少的缺点和错误，工作也遇到了不少的困难和损失；但也获得了一定的锻炼与提高，并且摸索到了继续前进的道路。现以淮河中游蓄洪控制工程中润河集分水闸的规划、设计、施工为例，说明我们在实际工作中的学习与掌握技术的道路。
            一、两次规划
    旧淮河发生洪水泛滥的基本原因，在河流本身来说，是蓄泄不当。正阳关是上游各支流汇归中游的总枢纽。在一九五○年的暴雨情况下，洪水在正阳关可能造成的最大洪水流量是一二、○○○秒立方公尺，而正阳关以下的河床，可能盛载和宣泄的最大流量是六、五○○秒立方公尺，上游来水的流量超过河槽所能容纳的流量差额水量最高达五、五○○秒立方公尺。正阳关以上，两岸分布有八个湖泊洼地，蓄水的最大容量可达七十二亿立方公尺，本来可以对淮河流量起很大的调节作用。但是，每当上游洪水初到，正阳关以下河床未满，尚可增加泄送时，洪水就过早地窜入湖洼，占据了应蓄洪水的容量；及至上游洪峰来到，中游河床渐满，不能增加泄送，来水和去水的差额水量必须另找出路，而这时，两岸的湖泊的蓄水量却也已达到饱和点，于是洪水仍漫溢而下，破堤成灾。
    中央规定淮河中游应根据蓄泄并重的原则改造旧淮河的自然情况，解决洪水问题。为了贯彻这一方针，我们曾经提出过两种规划方案。
    第一次我们提出修筑强固堤防，将河道与主要湖泊（霍邱城西湖与城东湖）分隔，在湖的上口修筑临时的草坝（就是一层土、一层草的土坝），洪水过大时开坝引水入湖。按照这一方案，对洪水蓄泄只能取得半控制，正阳关以下尚需承受八、五○○秒立方公尺的最大流量。这一方案虽然能将旧淮河的自然情况稍予改进，但仍未能完全解决汛期洪水问题。当时我们存在着如下思想情况：
        （一）要取得蓄泄的完全控制，必须修筑一系列的庞大复杂的水闸和堤坝。但这些水闸和堤坝是决不可能在短期间完成的。因此，只能修筑半控制的草坝。
        （二）技术上的马虎思想。以为承受八、五○○秒立方公尺的洪水流量，虽未能达到理想的解决问题，但比过去自然蓄洪情况已有改进。至于八、五○○秒立方公尺的流量标准推算是否正确，对正阳关以下影响究竟如何，均未深究。
    苏联专家布科夫同志来帮助工作后，提出了一串新的问题与意见。
    首先，他要求我们全面掌握洪水资料，并建议根据先用曲线图解法作初步分析。当水文工作同志按照他的指导绘制出整套的曲线图后，我们自己对原计划就提出了怀疑。因为图解显示，如果蓄泄能够完全控制，只需八亿立方公尺的“有效”蓄洪量，即可使正阳关最大流量不超过八、五○○秒立方公尺；如果能取得五十五亿立方公尺的有效蓄洪量，即可保持正阳关的最大流量不超过六、五○○秒立方公尺。但是，我们原计划的“半控制”的方案，却使用了七十亿的总蓄洪量才达到八、五○○秒立方公尺的流量标准。
    其次，他教我们试想各种方案研究用最简单的控制工程，求取最大的有效蓄洪量。对每个湖泊、每条支流、每段河床进行分析研究后，我们认识到：如果要求七十二亿立方公尺的总蓄洪量全部有效控制，确实需要一系列的水闸和堤坝工程；但如果利用润河集这一有利地形，修筑一个大分水闸控制河道泄量与入湖流量，则我们在整个分散复杂的局面中就能抓住了关键的控制。如果我们再能深入研究洪水发展的规律，寻找操纵蓄泄的办法，则我们可以从这一个建筑物中取得最大的蓄洪效益。根据这一认识，经过反复讨论，反复试算，终于制订出现行的淮河中游蓄洪计划：利用润河集分水闸，配合上把淮河和湖泊分隔的堤坝，控制有效蓄洪量五十五亿立方公尺，使正阳关的最大洪水流量不超过六、五○○秒立方公尺。
    布科夫同志鼓励我们，巨大的现代化的水闸建筑虽然有困难，但可以从技术上想办法力求简化。根据苏联的建设经验和中国解放一年来的建设成绩，他认为中国人民用自己的力量，在短期间完成这一建筑是有可能的。
    治淮委员会考虑这些建议之后，做出了庄严的决定：采用布科夫同志建议的工程规划，并用最大努力，争取在今年汛前完成，以求在今年汛期中，即取得与洪水斗争的主动权。
            二、不用基桩〔一〕
    国内水利建筑的传统是用桩基础。用桩基础的理由是：（一）基础土壤承载力不敷建筑物重量的需要；（二）如万一基础土壤被水流淘刷，建筑物仍依可靠基桩支持不致倒塌。上述理由中起决定作用的是第一项。
    在我们现有情况下，用桩基础有下列困难：（一）基桩的木材不易供给。润河集分水闸如用桩基础，约需十公尺长以上大桩一万二千根。（二）施工时间长。估计润河集分水闸打桩一万二千根，即使加快速度，至少需时三至四个月。这样，则在争取汛前完成是绝不可能的。
    很多工程人员早就知道：美国的建筑工程是惯用桩基础的，在欧洲，却已有建筑工程不用桩基础。但在过去，没有谁敢于在中国尝试不用桩基础，也没有谁去钻研这问题。
    布科夫同志介绍给我们苏联关于基础工程的新的理论与经验：（一）桩基础对于建筑物无利有害。它容许基础土壤更易为地下渗流冲蚀而致基础淘空，而且由于不易测定控制基桩的实际承载力，因而常使建筑物发生不均匀沉陷致造成裂缝等危险。
    （二）假使在设计方法上加以改进，可以设法使建筑物的总重量不超过基础土壤的安全承载能力。他举出苏联很多大建筑物直接承载在基础土壤上，情况良好。
    我们接受了他所建议的方法，决定润河集分水闸整个建筑不用基桩。
    在设计工作中遇到的第一个困难，是分水闸的各部结构设计都需改用新的计算方法。因为要在各种情况下，使作用于建筑物的合力接近基础中点。所以，各部的结构式样不能简单地按照成规，而需灵活配置。有时候，算了两三天配不出来，几乎认为在这一具体情况下，不用桩是不可能了。但设计工作同志为高度的热情支持着，算不出则另想办法。经过一次次的试算，技术逐渐熟练，终于将各部结构的初步设计都告完成。
    第二个困难是遇到了特殊坏的土壤。初步设计完成后，发现分水闸固定河床部分的基础土壤特殊恶劣，载重能力不够设计规定，而且有流沙泉眼。设计工作同志不得不重新赶做设计，终于，在新的困难前想出了新的巧妙办法。如将固定河床岸墙结构作分析后，计算到有一部分重量是因防止建筑物滑动而加上的，便将这部分重量减除，另用阻滑板解决滑动问题，载重便降到了规定标准以内。基桩土壤的流沙泉眼可能使建筑物发生不均匀沉陷的危险，布科夫同志建议我们挖除二公尺厚的基础土壤，用黄沙换填成基础土壤。我们接受了他的建议。当时，分水闸的基础已在河水位下三公尺，泉出如涌，工程艰难。如果要挖下二公尺，困难将更增加，部分同志曾对此发生疑虑。工人民工以自己的英勇智慧答复了这一疑虑。原定十天完成换填基础工作，由于抽水机工人加强了排水工作，民工更创造“换塘挖”的办法，提高了深塘挖土的效率〔二〕，提前完成了任务。
    在上述努力下，整个建筑物未用一根基桩。不用基桩不是靠放大基础，而是靠改进结构设计，局部改造基土。工程完成后，经一月余测量检验，各部结构仅有在容许范围内的轻微沉陷，未发现建筑物的不均匀沉陷及发生基础裂痕等不良情况。事实证明，不用基桩是安全可行的。在我国目前木材缺乏的情况下，更值得广泛提倡。
            三、不用板桩〔三〕
    影响水闸安全的重要关键之一是地下渗流的处理。
    在过去设计工作中，我们习惯以布莱氏或莱因氏的“理论”来推算渗流，设计板桩及基础。但是，在外国及本国的书本上，在大学的讲堂里，却早已提出对布莱及莱因理论的批判，提出用流线网法来推算渗流影响，提出木板桩并不可靠，并已有建议使用不透水黏土层及倒滤器不用板桩的办法。就中国的情况说，板桩材料是很困难的，因为木板桩需用美国洋松，钢板桩国内几无法供应。
    布科夫同志建议我们用不透水黏土层及倒滤器，不用板桩。我们接受了他的建议。在工作过程中，遇到各式各样的疑问和顾虑。人们感觉到，老的办法用了这么些年了，换个新的总怕不保险。人们提出，不透水的黏土层是有用的，但是我们对此无经验，能否做到不透水呢？不透水黏土层与混凝土间的接缝规定是用柏油油毛毡衬麻袋，但在制作黏土时，油毛毡是否会震裂呢？接缝筑得是否能不透水呢？我们接受了这些意见，以谨慎细心的态度来试筑这一新的工程项目。施工前做了多次试验，选出了黏土样，并定出了黏土的施工规则。经再三研究，规定了柏油油毛毡与混凝土的接缝办法。关于柏油油毛毡会否震裂的问题，看过实地制作情况的人便哑然失笑了。因为按设计规定制作成的油毛毡，实际是很厚实而且富于弹性的，并不像油纸般容易震裂。而最基本的是，群众的细心劳动可以答复各种顾虑。
    在上述努力下，分水闸的整个建筑物，没有用一块板桩。在润河集闸址，黏土来源是较困难的，需要从淮河对岸取运。但我们提出：“宁用隔河的本国黏土，不用隔海的美国洋松！”由于我们领导干部还缺乏经验，在黏土及倒滤器的施工布置中是有缺点的，应在今后改进的。但这完全不能影响如下结论：用不透水黏土层和倒滤器是安全可行的；在我国目前板桩材料缺乏情况下，更值得广泛提倡。
            四、不靠包工
    在过去，设计工作完成后，工程机关便将整个工程包给建筑公司或营造厂，施工是依靠各级包工掌握的，工程机关仅担负监督检查的工作。
    润河集分水闸工程包括二万四千余立方公尺的钢筋混凝土工程，七万三千余立方公尺的砌石工程，四百七十九公尺的闸门装置工程，及二百余立方公尺的土工。全部工程要求在不足四个月的施工时间完成。任务是那样庞大，时间是那样迫促，如何争取如期完成呢？治淮委员会考虑到，克服困难，完成任务的关键是技术与群众结合。因此，决定不假手包工而由治淮委员会直接主办，确保完成。
    我们衷心地领受了上级这一英明决定，并决心用一切努力来保证贯彻。当然，困难是有的，工程人员中，少数老工程师虽然经办过不少工程，但由于旧的包工办法的限制，仍感缺乏现场经验。绝大部分青年工程人员，连我在内，则根本未参加过稍大的水闸和堤坝工程。但是我们认识到，工程胜利的关键并不在此。关键是：我们有上级坚强的领导，有全国人民作为雄厚的后方，有健全的政治工作和供给工作，做工群众是有组织有觉悟的，各级干部是忠心耿耿的，这些都是包商所不可能具备的施工条件。这一工程虽然有其困难，但是在人民这样伟大的建设气魄下是必然可以克服的。至于我们个人的技术条件，还是记住毛主席的教导：“重要问题在于学习”。
    我们组织了各个工场，各个施工大队。工程人员到工场上自己动手放样、布置、指导，到施工大队中担任队长，工程人员与工人互相学习，共同工作。技术工作，由此不仅限于在纸面上划线，同时也在地面上检验了。我们学习掌握将工程从纸面移到地面的每一个细致的步骤，如：清基定线，安排模板木撑，脚手如何搭，钢筋如何扎，研究伸缩缝的做法，浇混凝土的劳动组合与施工方法，各种工程的穿插配合，人工的调度分配等等。
    施工的实际成绩证明：只有直接办理，不假手包工，才能保证工程的质量与进度，才能保证节约器材经费。同时也证明：只要走进实际、走进群众，技术智慧便能大大丰富。也只有这样，技术才算落了地而不是吊在半空。
    我们一致同意今后确立自办工程的方向。并且建议，由于这一新的施工条件，与我们现有材料（水泥、黄砂、碎石）的优良规格，可以要求将混凝土的设计安全抗压强度从每方吋六五○磅提高到八○○磅。这样将使国家能以同样的资材做更多的工程。我们提出并在今后工程中保证完成这一要求，并认为这是我们的爱国主义精神的表现。
            五、毛泽东思想照亮了
                我们的技术道路
        一年来，我们的学习仍跟不上工作发展的需要，这是由于我们还不善于掌握自己的学习，曾经发生并且现在还存在着对学习问题的认识偏差。少数同志抱着自己的老一套，拒绝接受新事物，他们或者满足于固有经验，或者满足于书本知识，不肯虚心地到实际中、到群众中学习，向苏联的先进经验学习。这样，过去的资历学识反变成今天进步的包袱。在今天祖国建设飞速前进，大家飞速前进的时候，一方面不能勇敢地跟上去，同时却开始感到落下来的苦恼。绝大部分同志深感自己知识不足，迫切要求学习，但苦于掌握不住正确的学习道路。有的认识到苏联技术的先进，但是反过来苦恼着自己不懂苏联文字，无从学习。有的认识到面向实际面向群众的重要，但缺乏正确的工作方法与学习方法，虽然吸取到不少实地经验，尚不能整理提高。有的认识到自己技术的贫乏，但反过来单纯着眼于技术学习，忽略了政治学习，致使技术进步仅限于具体一事一物的学习，不能从基本的立场、观点、方法上提高。
    但是通过工作中的各种偏差和失败，我仍逐步自觉地走上技术进步的大道——毛泽东思想照耀下的大道。
    毛泽东同志教导我们必须学习苏联的先进经验，我们照着他的话做，得到很大收获。毛泽东同志教导我们重视实践，我们照着他的话做，得到很大收获。感谢毛泽东同志，你的“实践论”发表于去年十二月，是你的“实践论”，鼓舞着引导着我们，学习治淮工程的规划、设计、施工。就我个人体会来说，在参加各种技术论争的时候，在遇到各种技术难题的时候，在迎接危急的工程情况的时候，在与中外专家共同工作的时候，在自己工作发生缺点和错误的时候，自己常苦恼自己政治技术的幼稚，感到无能应付。在这种时候，总记起毛主席“
    一定要把淮河修好”的政治号召，记起“实践论”中教导我们的认识运动的发展过程，记起自己应当做一个为毛泽东思想武装的战士，因而坚强起来，在工作中继续学习前进。
    在总结一年来的治淮工程，一年来我们自己的学习进步，迎接明年的光荣任务时，我们在此发出衷心的欢呼：“毛泽东思想照亮了我们的技术道路。我们一定在毛泽东思想照耀下，加紧改造自己，勇敢前进！”

    〔一〕基桩是建筑工程时，在工程的基础土壤上打下木桩，作为建筑物的基础，以支持工程建筑。
    〔二〕民工所挖的土，比水位低的，叫做“深塘”。在挖土时，因为有地下涌出的水，所以分段挖土，先挖深一处，使水流向挖得深的“塘”中，再挖没有水处的土。这样轮流挖土，就是“换塘挖”。
    〔三〕板桩，是用木板或钢板建筑在基础土壤的周围或上面，以隔离地下渗流的侵蚀。用黏土建筑障壁和用倒滤器排除渗流，可以不用板桩。黏土障壁就是“不透水黏土层”。在设计工程时，计算地下渗流对于基础土壤的影响，并计算将这种土壤引导向别处流去，绘出的图上有如线网的形状，就是“流线网法”。（附图片）
