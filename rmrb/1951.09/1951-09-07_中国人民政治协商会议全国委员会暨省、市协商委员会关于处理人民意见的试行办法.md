(Adopted at the 25th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on July 19, 1951)
    1. In order to strengthen the connection between the government and the people, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and provincial and municipal consultative committees should take accepting and handling people's opinions as an important task and designate specific personnel to manage it.
    2. People's opinions include suggestions, inquiries, requests, appeals, criticisms, etc. Whether they are presented orally or in writing, they must be handled seriously to ensure that they are implemented and accounted for.
    3. The National Committee or provincial and municipal consultative committees should, according to the nature of the people's opinions, handle them themselves or refer them to the relevant responsible organs of the People's Government, democratic parties, people's organizations, etc., for handling.
    4. The aforementioned relevant responsible organs must promptly handle and reply to the people's opinions forwarded by the National Committee or provincial and municipal consultative committees in order to forward them to the original proposer of the opinion. If the matter is delayed for a long time, the National Committee or provincial and municipal consultative committees should pay attention to urging them.
    5. If the National Committee or provincial and municipal consultative committees find that the opinions raised by the people are not easy to resolve for the time being, they should first reply to the original proposer of the opinion with a preliminary statement. If it cannot be handled due to special circumstances, the reasons and grounds should also be communicated to them.
    6. The National Committee or provincial and municipal consultative committees should summarize the work of handling people's opinions every six months, and the provincial and municipal consultative committees must submit the summary report to the National Committee.
    7. The standing committees of people's representative conferences at the county level and the consultative committees of people's representative conferences in districts of large cities may refer to these measures for handling people's opinions.
