Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 18th: The Bucharest Military Tribunal in Romania's capital tried a group of American and Vatican spy criminals from the 10th to the 17th. The defendants included Baha, Proș, Hubert, Pintori, Stefanescu, Sandulescu, and others, totaling ten people. Most of them were high-ranking members of the Catholic Church, employed by American intelligence agencies and the Vatican to conduct espionage activities in Romania, including collecting various intelligence, organizing terrorist groups, and spreading speeches against the Romanian People's regime. The trial also confirmed that Italian diplomatic personnel in Romania, such as Minister Scamacca, Chargé d'affaires Punini, and official Mesteri, directly directed espionage activities. The Italian espionage center in Romania is merely a link in the American imperialist espionage system against Romania.

The criminals have all confessed their crimes in court. De Missura and Banat Diocese Catholic Bishop, defendant Baha, confessed that he had been acting as a Vatican spy since 1925. He had supplied the Vatican with extremely important political and economic intelligence about Romania. After 1934, under the orders of the Vatican, he frequently contacted Hitler, organized a "Fifth Column" in Romania, and ordered the priests in his jurisdiction to fully support Hitler. After the liberation of Romania, he continued to lead espionage activities. Defendant Catholic Bishop Proș confessed that he had been engaged in espionage activities under the direction of Baha and Mesteri since December 1948. He used priests and anti-Romanian elements in various places to collect various intelligence. Defendant Hubert confessed that he had directed a large number of nuns to collect intelligence. The intelligence collected by Proș and Hubert was sent to Rome via the Italian Embassy. Defendant Pintori, a former employee of the Italian Embassy in Romania, confessed that after the liberation of Romania in 1944, he collected intelligence about the Romanian government, especially personnel aspects of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the work of people's committees at all levels, and directly submitted it to Scamacca. He and defendant Stefanescu, a senior supervisor of Catholic church schools, collected intelligence that was not only sent to Rome but also supplied to the "Voice of America" radio station. Defendant Stefanescu and another senior supervisor, Sandulescu, also admitted to organizing terrorist groups and carrying out sabotage activities against the Romanian democratic regime. All other defendants also admitted their crimes in court.

The court has sentenced Proș, Pintori, Stefanescu, and Sandulescu to life imprisonment with hard labor based on the crimes committed by the defendants, sentenced Hubert to life imprisonment, and Baha to eighteen years in prison. The other defendants were sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment.

    罗判决一批美国间谍
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特军事法庭于十日至十七日审讯一批美国和梵蒂冈的间谍罪犯。被告计有巴哈、普罗什、休伯特、平托里、斯台法尼斯库、桑杜列斯库等十人。他们大多数是天主教的上层分子，受美国间谍机关和梵蒂冈雇用，在罗马尼亚进行搜集各种情报、组织恐怖团体和散布反对罗马尼亚人民政权的言论等间谍活动。审讯并证实意大利驻罗马尼亚的外交人员如公使斯卡马卡、代办普宁尼、以及官员美斯特里等人都直接指挥间谍活动。意大利在罗马尼亚的间谍中心，不过是美帝国主义反对罗马尼亚的间谍体系的一个环节。
    罪犯们都已在法庭上供认他们的罪行。的密索拉和巴纳特教区天主教主教、被告巴哈供认：他从一九二五年起就充当梵蒂冈的间谍。他曾把罗马尼亚极重要的政治和经济情报供给梵蒂冈。一九三四年以后，他奉梵蒂冈命令和希特勒经常联系，在罗马尼亚组织“第五纵队”，命令其所辖教区的教士们全力支持希特勒。罗马尼亚解放后他一直领导着间谍活动。被告天主教主教普罗什供认：他从一九四八年十二月开始就在巴哈和美斯特里指挥下进行间谍活动。他利用各地教士和敌视罗马尼亚分子搜集各种情报。被告休伯特供认：他曾指挥大批修女搜集情报。普罗什和休伯特搜集的情报都经由意大利公使馆送往罗马。被告平托里是意大利驻罗马尼亚公使馆旧职员，他供认他在一九四四年罗马尼亚解放以后，曾搜集关于罗马尼亚政府特别是外交部人事方面的情报和各级人民委员会工作的情报，直接送交斯卡马卡。他和被告天主教教会学校高级督学斯台法尼斯库一同搜集的情报，不仅送往罗马，而且还供给“美国之音”电台。被告斯台法尼斯库和另一个高级督学桑杜列斯库也承认组织恐怖团体，进行反对罗马尼亚民主政权的破坏活动。其他各被告也都在法庭上承认了罪行。
    法庭已根据被告们所犯罪行，判处普罗什、平托里、斯台法尼斯库、桑杜列斯库四人终身劳役，判处休伯特无期徒刑、巴哈十八年徒刑。其他各被告被判处刑期不等的徒刑。
