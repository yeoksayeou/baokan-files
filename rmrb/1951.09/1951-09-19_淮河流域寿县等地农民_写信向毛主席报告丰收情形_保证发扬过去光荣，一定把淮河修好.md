Farmers in the Huai River basin have written letters to Chairman Mao one after another to report on this year's bumper harvest and express their heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao. Thirty-two farmhands in Dadian Township, Yinghe District, Shou County, northern Anhui, wrote to Chairman Mao saying: The construction of the Runheji Sluice has resulted in a good harvest on the lake land that had not been harvested for more than 20 years. We harvested a good crop of wheat in the summer, and now we have harvested more than 10,000 jin of sorghum; in less than half a month, we will be able to harvest more than 10,000 jin of rice. Now, we have noodles in our pots, new clothes on our backs, and we have bought some farming tools, and our lives are getting better and better. If it weren't for your call to harness the Huai River, we would still be squatting in the water! Li Qincai, a model worker in harnessing the Huai River in Yangwei Village, Sihong County, said in his letter: Because the Sui River has been harnessed, I harvested 17 shih of wheat in the summer, and I have already harvested 5 shih of sorghum in the autumn, and the late autumn crops are still in the ground. Now, my family has a surplus of food besides eating, and I have bought a big ox. My life was given to me by Chairman Mao, and I am willing to repay you with my model action in harnessing the Huai River.

Many model farmers who participated in harnessing the Huai River said in their letters that they must work hard to repair the Huai River. Zhang Jinghe, a model worker in harnessing the Huai River in Sancha Village, Wuhe County, said in his letter: I have been selected as a model six times in a row in harnessing the Huai River, and after harnessing the Huai River, I returned to the village to lead production. Now production has achieved a bumper harvest, and my family has harvested more than ten shih of soybeans, and the yield has increased by three-tenths compared with the past. The second phase of the Huai River harnessing project will start soon, and I have already signed up. I have already held a preparatory meeting for harnessing the Huai River in our village, and organized seventy-six young people to prepare to go to the embankment. Gan Caihua, a special-class female hero who built the Bengbu Enclosure Embankment, also wrote to Chairman Mao, saying: I assure you: in the future Huai River harnessing, I will definitely work hard, maintain the past glory, and repair the Huai River well.

    淮河流域寿县等地农民
    写信向毛主席报告丰收情形
    保证发扬过去光荣，一定把淮河修好
    淮河流域的农民们，纷纷写信向毛主席报告今年丰收的情形，向毛主席表示衷心的感谢。皖北寿县迎河区大店乡三十二个雇农写给毛主席的信中说：修了润河集分水闸，使我们这里二十多年不收的湖地都丰收了。夏天收了一季好麦子，现在我们又收了一万多斤秫秫（高粱）；不要半月还能收一万多斤稻子。现在，我们锅里有了面食，身上穿了新衣，买了一些农具，日子越过越好了。假如不是您号召治淮，现在我们还在水里蹲着呢！泗洪县杨圩村一等治淮模范李勤才的信上说：因为濉河治好了，夏季我收了十七石麦子，秋季已经收了五石秫秫，晚秋还在地里。现在，我家的粮食除吃还有节余，我已买了一条大牛。我的日子是毛主席给我的，我愿拿治淮的模范行动来报答您。
    许多参加治淮的模范农民，在信上表示一定要出力把淮河修好。五河县三岔村治淮模范张井和的信上说：我在治淮中连续六次被选为模范，治淮后又回村领导生产。现在生产得到了丰收，我家就收了十多石黄豆，产量比以前提高十分之三。第二期治淮工程快开工了，我已经报了名。我在本村已召开了治淮准备会议，组织了七十六个青壮年准备上堤。修蚌埠圈堤的特等女功臣甘彩华，也给毛主席写信说：俺向你保证：在今后治淮中，俺一定要努力，保持过去的光荣，把淮河修好。（新华社）
