In Hubei Province, the average yield of intermediate rice is about 350 jin per mu, with general areas having 70% to 80% of the harvest, and the Yichang Special District having a yield of 500 jin per mu. In the counties around Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, the harvest of intermediate rice is about 500 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 800 jin. During the autumn harvest in various places, the order of the autumn harvest is generally good due to the farmers organizing to protect the autumn harvest. Henan Province has had a good harvest of early autumn crops, with sorghum production increasing by 20% to 30% compared to last year.

    中南区长江两岸
    今年中稻基本丰收
    河南早秋作物也丰收了
    中南区长江两岸中稻基本丰收。各地农民在八月中旬就先后开始收割，到目前止，大部分已收割完毕。湖北省中稻平均每亩收成三百五十斤左右，一般地区有七成至八成收获，宜昌专区每亩产量达五百斤。湖南省洞庭湖周围各县，中稻收成每亩在五百斤左右，最高的达八百斤。各地在秋收中，由于农民组织起来护秋，秋收秩序一般良好。河南省早秋作物丰收，高粱比去年增产二至三成。棉农已开始收摘棉花；今年棉花比去年长得好，良种棉花每亩较去年增产十四斤左右，一般晚秋作物生长得也好。（本报武汉记者站）
