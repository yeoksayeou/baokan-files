Pay Attention to Political Propaganda When Teaching National Day Songs
The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has stipulated the basic songs to be sung nationwide for this year's National Day. Based on the experience of teaching five basic songs during the May Day this year, this is one of the good ways to conduct patriotic political education among the broad masses of the people. To do this work well, we should pay attention to:

	I. Before teaching, the meaning of the lyrics must be explained clearly to the masses. It is best to explain it in connection with current affairs and the personal experiences of the masses. This will not only improve the political understanding of the masses, but also help them remember the lyrics.

	II. In addition to singing these basic songs on National Day, singing contests can also be organized to deepen the masses' impression of these songs and give fuller play to their role. The content of the competition, in addition to group singing, should also include checking the masses' understanding of the lyrics. This kind of inspection often becomes a speech meeting where the broad masses express their love for their great motherland, denounce the crimes of the enemy, and express their determination to take patriotic actions in the future. During the May Day this year, before the singing competition on Qianling East Road in Guiyang City, Guizhou, residents of various streets practiced singing and discussing the meaning of the lyrics; during the competition, Lei Yuxiu, a vegetable vendor, explained the lyrics "uproot the reactionary forces" and, in connection with his past experiences, denounced the crimes of American imperialism. Worker Che Yucheng vividly explained the meaning of "people of the world unite closely" with the analogy of "one chopstick is easy to break, but a bunch of chopsticks is not easy to break." After the inspection, the cadres summarized the explanation of the meaning of the lyrics on the spot. This gave everyone a deep impression of the content of the lyrics.

	III. For activists who want to learn culture, blackboards, character books, etc. should also be used to teach them to recognize the new characters in the lyrics and enable them to explain according to the words.

### 教唱国庆节歌曲时应注意政治宣传

    教唱国庆节歌曲时应注意政治宣传
    中央人民政府文化部已经规定了今年国庆节全国普唱的基本歌曲。根据今年五一节教唱五个基本歌曲的经验，这是对全国广大人民进行爱国主义政治教育的良好方式之一。要作好这一工作，应该注意：
    一、教唱前，必须将歌词意义向群众讲解清楚。解释时最好能联系当前时事和群众切身经验。这样，不仅能提高群众的政治认识，而且能帮助群众记熟歌词。
    二、这些基本歌曲除在国庆节歌唱外，还可以组织歌咏比赛，以便加深群众对这些歌曲的印象，更充分地发挥这些歌曲的作用。比赛内容，除整队歌唱外，最好还包括检查群众对于歌词的认识。这种检查，往往就成为广大群众表示热爱自己伟大的祖国，控诉敌人罪恶，表示今后爱国行动决心的讲演会。今年五一节，贵州贵阳市黔灵东路歌咏比赛前，各街道居民即纷纷练唱和讨论歌词的意义；比赛中，卖菜小贩雷毓秀解释歌词“把反动势力连根拔”时，联系自己过去的遭遇，控诉了美帝国主义的罪恶。工人车玉成用“一根筷子容易折断，一把筷子不容易断”的比喻生动地解释了“全世界人民团结紧”的意义。检查后，再由干部当场对词意解释加以总结。这样就使大家对歌词内容有深刻印象。
    三、对于要求学文化的积极分子，还应使用黑板、生字本等教他们认识歌词中的生字，并使他们学会按词讲解。
