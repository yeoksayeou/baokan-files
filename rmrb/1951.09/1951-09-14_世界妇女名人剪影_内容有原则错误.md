    "World Women's Celebrity Silhouettes" Contains Errors of Principle

    To the Editor:
    We recently read "World Women's Celebrity Silhouettes" (authored by an anonymous writer, published by Sanlian Bookstore, published in May 1951). The content of this book is extremely erroneous and harmful. The book actually praises certain reactionary foreign women, such as Madame Sanger and Madame Naidu, as "celebrities," which is an error of principle. In introducing Madame Sanger, the author says, "Her motives, aspirations, spirit, and perseverance are admirable"; and blindly promotes birth control theory, such as "...contraceptives and books on contraception can be sold publicly, Madame Sanger's tireless efforts should be given the credit," this kind of "birth control" propaganda is completely against the interests of the people and the state policy. Not only that, the author even openly promotes Malthus' reactionary theory: "Moreover, the biggest problem in the world today is overpopulation. For some nations, overpopulation has become a serious social disease, often swept away by natural famines and plagues. At the same time, overpopulated countries often have to expand outwards, resulting in war," which is clearly doing free publicity for imperialist wars of aggression.
    Sanlian Bookstore has achieved great success in publishing work and enjoys a high reputation among readers. Now, it has actually published this book, which completely violates Marxism-Leninism, mixing the spurious with the genuine, which is unforgivable. It is hoped that the store will conduct a profound self-criticism.
                                                                                                    Lin Hui

### “世界妇女名人剪影”内容有原则错误

    “世界妇女名人剪影”内容有原则错误编辑同志：
    最近我们读到了“世界妇女名人剪影”（佚名著、三联书店发行、一九五一年五月出版）。这本书的内容是极其错误有害的。该书竟把某些反动的外国妇女如山额夫人、奈都夫人，也推崇为“名人”，这是原则性的错误。在介绍山额夫人时，作者说：“她的动机、怀抱、精神和毅力，是很令人钦佩的”；又盲目地宣传节育理论，如“……避孕药和避孕书可以公开发售，山额夫人不屈不挠的努力应居首功”，这种“节育”宣传是完全违反人民利益和国家政策的。不仅如此，作者还居然公开宣传马尔萨斯的反动理论：“况且目前世界的最大问题在于人口过剩。有些民族，人口过剩已经成为严重的社会病症，常常由自然的饥荒和疠疫来扫荡那多余的人口。同时，人口过剩的国家，常常要向外发展，结果就造成了战争”，这明明是在为帝国主义的侵略战争作义务宣传。
    三联书店在出版工作方面有很大的成绩，在读者中有很高的信誉，现在竟鱼目混珠地出版了这一本完全违反马克思列宁主义的书，这是不能令人原谅的，希望该店深刻检讨。    林晖
