The key to the success of democratic remedial work lies in whether leading cadres can boldly mobilize the masses of workers.

Whether or not the lesson of democratic reform in industrial and mining enterprises can be made up well depends on whether the leading cadres can let go in mobilizing the masses of workers. In order to prevent deviations in letting go and mobilizing the masses of workers, the following points of experience that have been effective and repeatedly proven should be noted:

First, the Party and the People's Government's policies and methods for democratic reform should be clearly, thoroughly, and repeatedly explained to the workers, staff, and their families so that they have a clear understanding, can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, distinguish right from wrong, dispel concerns, and encourage the masses, shake the enemy, and achieve the goal of uniting the majority and attacking the minority.

Second, policies should be implemented promptly and conscientiously, actions should match words, and actions should be taken where words are spoken. Based on the size of the crimes of the object of struggle, the quality of production technology, the attitude towards labor after liberation, the degree of admitting mistakes, being frank, and self-criticism, and the opinions of the broad masses of workers, deal with a few in a timely manner. This practical action has a significant effect on mobilizing the masses and shaking and dividing the enemy. "Facts speak louder than words." In this regard, the experiences of Wuhan, Qingdao, and Jinan are completely consistent.

Third, leading cadres should go deep into the masses to visit the virtuous (real activists) and the suffering (the oppressed), use individual connections (that is, use individual conversations to discover, cultivate, and organize activists), establish solid foundations, and form the leading backbone and core of the movement. These activists generally need to meet the following four conditions:

(1) Long-term labor, active in production;
(2) Firm stance, selfless;
(3) Democratic style, contact with the masses;
(4) Clear history, often oppressed by foremen.

Fourth, establish a unified and open leading body with the Party committee or branch as the core, including cadres from administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League who have been vetted. If the leadership composition of the trade union committee is too complicated and has too bad an influence among the masses, the superior trade union organization should convene a membership meeting to declare it illegal and establish a temporary organization such as a trade union preparatory reorganization committee to show its attitude and explain its policies. At the same time, contact with the broad masses of workers and staff should also be established through employee representative conferences dominated by activists.

Fifth, the top leader should be responsible, take action personally, make breakthroughs on key points, and gain experience. This is especially important in the initial stage. Wuhan, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places that have done well have adopted this approach.

Sixth, fight the first battle well. In order for the democratic reform movement in a factory or region to develop smoothly, just like in combat, the success or failure of the first battle has an important effect. Therefore, the first battle should be particularly cautious. The so-called caution is not to be restrained, not to dare to let go, and to be replaced by the leadership, but to carefully select the object of struggle, and to conduct full explanation, brewing, and preparation among the masses in terms of the purpose, significance, methods, and means of the struggle. If you don't fight, then don't fight, but if you fight, you must fight well. Because the democratic reform movement, not to mention in a region, even in a factory, must fight several battles in a row to solve the problem. Therefore, the victory or failure of the first battle has a significant effect on encouraging the fighting spirit of the masses,打击敌人的气焰以至动摇、分化、瓦解敌人方面都有着重大的作用。

Seventh, proceed from reality. In terms of the object and method of struggle and the steps of movement development, due to the different nature of the enterprise, the history of struggle of the workers, and other conditions, it cannot and should not be generalized, but should be "adapted to local conditions" and "make up for what is lacking."

Eighth, stop at the appropriate time, put forward new tasks in a timely manner, and shift the movement to a new stage. For example, when the democratic struggle has progressed to a certain extent, it should be shifted to democratic unity in a timely manner; when democratic unity has progressed to a certain extent, it should be shifted to democratic construction centered on production in a timely manner. This keeps the masses' emotions always full, so as not to slacken because a certain stage of the movement develops excessively and drags on for too long.

Ninth, pay attention to constantly improving the level of awareness of the workers and staff in the movement, so that their understanding of the problem changes from direct to indirect, from perceptual to rational, and from phenomenon to essence. For example, when recalling and complaining about the crimes of the feudal foremen, one should further and naturally connect it to the reactionary rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang. For example, when recalling today's happy life, one should further and naturally connect it to the superiority of the Communist Party, the People's Government, New Democracy, and even the future socialist system.

The attitude of all parties in industrial and mining enterprises towards democratic reform

The broad masses of workers who have been oppressed and exploited by those feudal foremen in the past and are still being oppressed and exploited now are extremely supportive and enthusiastically demanding the struggle against the foremen. They have long wanted to move the stones that are pressing on their heads, spit out the bitter water in their stomachs for many years, and vent their anger. In some factories, the number of people who spoke at this kind of complaint meeting against the foremen reached more than 80% of the total number of participants.

Under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, some workers and staff were once forced to join reactionary organizations, but did not do anything that would harm the workers. They hope to find an opportunity to have a sincere and honest movement to unload the ideological burden that the enemy has placed on them.

There are also some workers and staff who have used the reactionary forces of imperialism and the Kuomintang to do some things that harm the workers, but they are not very serious. After a vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the workers unanimously demanding to struggle against them, they are panicked every day and cannot eat or sleep. They are part of the object of struggle in the democratic reform process. They are a bit like landlords in the land reform who have committed crimes but are not very serious. They also have the attitude of "early struggle, early peace, late struggle, late peace, no struggle, no peace."

The leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the factory, except for a few comrades who were a little worried at the beginning because they did not know the situation, had no experience, were afraid of making trouble, and were afraid of affecting production, the vast majority wanted to remove this stumbling block. A worker from the Yangmeishan Coal Mine in Hunan gave a very good answer to the leadership's concerns: "Please rest assured on the administrative side about this point (referring to causing chaos and hindering production)! Even if it hinders a little current production and causes a little chaos (cannot cause a big chaos), it is only temporary and will be a ten-thousand-fold profit." The capitalists in private enterprises also believe that "democratic reform is 70% beneficial to workers and 30% beneficial to capitalists." Only a very few reactionary elements with great crimes have a firm attitude of resistance to democratic reform.

Based on the analysis of the attitudes of the above-mentioned relevant parties towards democratic reform, this is an extremely broad mass movement. As long as we can grasp the policies firmly, we can completely achieve the goal of "uniting the majority and attacking the minority."

"This is what it's like to be the master of our own house!"

In all factories, railways, or mines that have conscientiously mobilized the masses and implemented democratic reform, the new labor attitude of the masses of workers has been established, labor discipline has been strengthened, and labor productivity has been improved. Some factories, in the process of implementing democratic reform, once occupied more than 20% of the production time for a continuous month; but the production tasks that could not be completed before are now completed on time and ahead of schedule. The relationship between workers and staff, and the relationship between cadres and the masses have been improved. When Party and trade union cadres go to the workshop, the masses of workers no longer treat them coldly and indifferently as they did in the past; the prestige of the Party among the masses of workers has been greatly improved. Whenever Chairman Mao is mentioned at various meetings, everyone automatically and enthusiastically applauds. The work of the trade union is easier to do, and the "shift change" thought of trade union cadres (that is, the thought of not wanting to do trade union work and wanting to change shifts) is gone. When the trade union convenes mass meetings, it no longer needs to use acting and showing movies as a call as it did in the past, and it can be done on time and not leave until the meeting is over. The production responsibility system and inspection system are quickly established; political accidents are greatly reduced or even disappear. Those who had falsely reported their seniority, factory seniority, and direct dependent relatives when registering for labor insurance cards in the past, and concealed their family background and personal history, also voluntarily confessed and asked to correct them; in some factories, the number of places where such confessions and corrections were made reached more than half of the number of card registrations. The literary and artistic activities of the workers and staff in the factory have been greatly enlivened, and the workers and staff have automatically compiled many scripts, fast-clappers, and cross-talk related to democratic reform. The club of Chengdu Yarn Factory in Jinan has developed from more than 30 people regularly participating in activities to more than 280 people regularly participating in activities. The number of students in the workers' and staff's spare time literacy schools in some factories has doubled after democratic reform. In a word, after democratic remedial work, the situation in many factories is completely different from the past, and it is completely new. These facts illustrate a truth - if the masses are not mobilized and their class consciousness is not raised, then all good methods are in danger of degenerating into formalism. In this democratic reform process, many fake activists, fake "Party members," fake "Communist Youth League members," and even individual fake "model workers" were discovered. After democratic reform, the masses of workers removed the stones that were pressing on their heads and completely turned over, they no longer said "those who used to get along well still get along well now"; but said: "Those who used to get along well don't get along well now!" No longer say "being in charge but not making decisions"; but say: "This is what it's like to be the master of our own house!"

    论厂矿企业中民主改革的补课问题（下）
    刘子久
    民主补课能否搞好的关键在于领导干部是否能放手发动工人群众
    工矿企业中的民主改革这一课，是否能够补好，关键就是看领导干部在发动工人群众方面是否能够放手。为了在放手发动工人群众方面不致发生偏差，应当注意下列几点已经行之有效，并且屡试不爽的经验：
    第一，要明确地、详细地、反复地向工人、职员群众和他们的家属讲明党与人民政府对于民主改革补课的政策和办法，使他们心中有数、分清敌我，辨明是非，打消顾虑，以鼓励群众，动摇敌人，达到团结多数，打击少数的目的。
    第二，要及时地、认真地执行政策，要言行一致，说到那里做到那里，根据被斗争对象的罪恶的大小、生产技术的好坏、解放后的劳动态度、低头认错、坦白、检讨的程度以及广大工人群众的意见，及时地处理几个。这种实际行动，对于发动群众、动摇与分化敌人有着重大的作用，“事实胜于雄辩”。在这一方面，武汉、青岛、济南的经验是完全一致的。
    第三，领导干部要深入群众访贤（真正的积极分子）、访苦（受压迫的人），用个别串连（即用个别谈话的方式去发现、培养与组织积极分子），扎正根子，形成运动中的领导骨干与核心。这种积极分子一般的要具备下列四个条件：
    （一）长年劳动，生产积极；
    （二）立场坚定，大公无私；
    （三）作风民主，联系群众；
    （四）历史清楚，常受把头的压迫。
    第四，建立以党委或支部为核心，包括行政、工会、青年团中经过审查的干部所组成的统一的公开的领导机关。如果工会委员会的领导成份太复杂，在群众中影响太坏的，应由上级工会组织召开会员大会宣布它是非法的，成立工会筹备改组委员会一类的临时机构，借以表明态度，说明政策。同时，还要通过以积极分子为主的职工代表会议，与广大职工群众建立联系。
    第五，要首长负责、亲自动手，重点突破、取得经验。这一点在开始阶段尤其是重要。武汉、青岛、济南等地，凡是做得好的地方，都是采用这种方式。
    第六，要打好第一仗。在一个厂矿或地区的民主改革运动，要想得到顺利的发展，也像作战一样，第一仗打的好坏，有着重要的作用。因此第一仗要特别慎重。所谓慎重不是束手束脚、不敢放手、由领导上来包办代替，而是要慎重地选择斗争对象，在斗争的目的、意义、方式、方法等方面要在群众中进行充分的解释、酝酿与准备，不打则已，打就要打好。因为，民主改革运动不用说在一个地区，就是在一个厂里，也要一连串地打几仗才能解决问题。因此，第一仗的胜利与否，对于鼓舞群众的斗争情绪；打击敌人的气焰以至动摇、分化、瓦解敌人方面都有着重大的作用。
    第七，要从实际出发。在斗争的对象与方式和运动发展的步骤等方面，由于企业的性质，工人群众的斗争历史等条件的不同，不能也不应该一般化，而是应该“因地制宜”，“缺什么补什么”。
    第八，要适可而止，及时地提出新的任务，使运动转入新的阶段。比如民主斗争进行到了一定的程度，即应及时地转入民主团结；民主团结进行到了一定程度时，即应及时地转入以生产为中心的民主建设。这样使群众的情绪经常饱满，不致因为运动的某一阶段发展得过度拖得过久而松劲。
    第九，要注意从运动中不断地提高工人、职员群众的觉悟程度，使他们对于问题的认识由直接到间接，由感性到理性，由现象到本质。比如回忆诉苦到封建把头的罪恶时，就应进一步很自然地联系到帝国主义、国民党的反动统治制度。又如回忆到今天的幸福生活时，就应进一步很自然地联系到共产党、人民政府、新民主主义以至将来的社会主义制度的优越性等。
    工矿企业中各方面对民主改革的态度
    那些过去受过直到现在仍然受着那些封建把头的压迫、剥削的广大工人群众，对于反对把头的斗争是极端拥护，热烈要求。他们老早就想搬掉压在他们头上的石头，吐一吐若干年来自己肚子里的苦水，出出气。有些工厂在这种反对把头的诉苦会上，发言的人数达到参加会议的总人数的百分之八十以上。
    在帝国主义、国民党反动派统治之下，有一部分工人、职员群众、曾经被迫加入过反动组织，但没有作过对不起工人群众的事情的，希望找一个机会来一个忠诚、老实运动，借以卸下敌人给他们加上的这个思想包袱。
    还有一部分工人、职员曾经借着帝国主义、国民党的反动势力，作过一些危害工人的勾当，但不十分严重，在经过了大张旗鼓镇压反革命，工人群众
    一致起来要求斗争他们的情况之下，他们就天天惶惶不安、吃不下饭，睡不着觉。他们是民主改革过程中的一部分斗争对象，他们有点像在土地改革中有罪恶但不十分大的地主一样，也有“早斗早安、晚斗晚安、不斗不安”之势。
    工厂中党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部，除个别同志开始时由于情况不明、没有经验、怕捣乱、怕影响生产，有点顾虑之外，绝大多数都是想去掉这块绊脚石。湖南杨梅山煤矿的一个工人对于领导上的这种顾虑解答得很好：“这一点（按指搞乱与妨碍生产）请行政方面放心吧！即使妨碍一点当前生产，小小地乱一下（不能大乱）那也是一时的，将要一本万利的。”在私营企业的资本家方面也认为：“民主改革是对工人七分有利，对资方三分有利。”只有极个别罪恶大的反动分子，对于民主改革才抱坚决地对抗态度。
    根据上述各有关方面对于民主改革的态度的分析来看，这是一个极为广泛的群众性的运动。只要是我们能够把政策掌握得稳，是完全能够达到“团结多数，打击少数”的目的的。
    “这样才像个当家作主的样子！”
    凡是经过放手、认真发动群众，实行了民主改革的工厂、铁路或矿山，工人群众的新的劳动态度树立起来了，劳动纪律加强了，劳动生产率提高了。有些工厂在实行民主改革的过程中，曾经在连续一个月的时间内，占用生产时间达百分之二十以上；但以前完不成的生产任务，现在反而按时超额完成了。工人和职员的关系、干部和群众的关系都改善了。党和工会的干部到车间去时，工人群众见了也再不像过去那样冷冷淡淡，带理不理的样子了；党在工人群众中的威信大大地提高了，在各种会议上
    一提到毛主席，大家就都自动地热情地鼓起掌来。工会的工作好作了，工会干部的“换班”思想（即不愿干工会工作，希望换班的思想）没有了。工会召开群众大会时再也不要像过去那样必须以演戏、放映电影作号召，就能作到按时到齐，会不开完不走了。生产上的责任制、检查制很快地建立起来了；政治性的事故大为减少甚至绝迹了。过去劳动保险卡片登记时曾经虚报工龄、厂龄、直系供养亲属，隐瞒家庭成份、个人历史的，也都自动坦白并要求改正了；有的厂子这种坦白、更正的地方，竟达于卡片登记人数的半数以上。工厂内工人、职员群众的文艺活动大大地活跃了，工人、职员自动地编了许多有关民主改革的剧本、快板、相声。济南的成大纱厂的俱乐部由三十余人经常参加活动，一下子发展到二百八十余人经常参加活动。有些工厂职工业余补习学校的学员在民主改革后发展了一倍。一句话，经过民主补课之后，许多工厂中情况与过去完全不同了，焕然一新了。这些事实，说明了一条真理——如果群众不经过发动，他们的阶级觉悟没有提高，那么，什么好的办法都有流于形式主义的危险。在这次民主改革过程中，就发现了不少假的积极分子、假“党员”、假“青年团员”、甚至个别假“劳动模范”。在经过民主改革，工人群众搬掉了压在他们头上的石头，彻底翻身之后，再不说“过去吃得开的人现在还吃得开”；而是说：“过去吃得开的人现在吃不开了！”再不说“当家不作主”；而是说：“这才像个当家作主的样子了！”
