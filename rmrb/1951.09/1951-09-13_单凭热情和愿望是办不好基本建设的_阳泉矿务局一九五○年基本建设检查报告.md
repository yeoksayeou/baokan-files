Following the People's Daily's publication of a report on July 6th about our bureau's basic construction being unattended and suffering from serious waste, we conducted an inspection of the basic construction projects of 1950 in accordance with the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's notice on strictly inspecting basic construction work, and in conjunction with the materials reported in the People's Daily. We found that there were many shortcomings in our basic construction work in 1950, and some of the shortcomings were quite serious. The shortcomings are manifested in the following aspects:

    Plans were not thorough enough, lacking detailed investigation and research, resulting in rework and waste.

    Basic construction plans should be made according to needs based on investigation and research of actual conditions, producing design plans, which are then reviewed and approved before construction begins. However, in order to start work and receive funds as soon as possible, we made plans and then surveyed, or even designed while constructing. As a result, the plans were divorced from reality and could not be completed according to plan. For example, the No. 4 Mine's explosives warehouse project was planned to be built 300 meters away from the production wellhead according to safety production needs. However, we did not conduct on-the-spot surveys of the actual conditions of the building foundation, and were eager to start construction after the plan was approved. It was not until construction began that we discovered cracks in the ground and had to move the lime and stones that had already been transported to another place. Later, because the construction site did not comply with the newly promulgated security regulations, we had to move it again. Similarly, when formulating the headlamp room project plan, we did not consider the terrain well. When construction started, we found that the terrain was narrow, so we had to change the original plan of eleven rooms to seven rooms. The location arrangement was also not well considered, and we did not consider it from a developmental point of view, so we built the headlamp room at the west inclined shaft. If the west inclined shaft is developed later, part of it will have to be demolished. Another example is when making the plan for the 196-meter double-arch culvert project in the No. 4 Mine, we only based it on the already measured railway branch line and the development and expansion of various civil buildings. We did not contact and research with the railway bureau and other relevant parties on whether the branch line would be built according to the measured route, whether there would be any difficulties, and what problems might arise. We subjectively believed that the branch line was designed by the railway bureau and there would be no problems, so we took it as a basis and started construction. As a result, the railway branch line plan was changed, which directly conflicted with the double-arch culvert project, forcing the project to be suspended pending resolution.

    The design was rough, without on-site surveys, and construction started without review, resulting in omissions and repeated budget increases.

    Our attitude towards design work was not serious enough. The design lacked necessary survey measurements and calculations, and only relied on experience and habits to work. In addition, there was no organization of specialized review personnel to conduct the review, resulting in many loopholes. For example, the large number of housing projects in 1950 only designed the house drawings based on the plane topography, estimated a part of the earthwork and stone cost and included it in the budget, and considered the design work completed. There was no on-site survey of the terrain, calculation of earthwork and stone, and no detailed and meticulous detailed drawings and project descriptions were drawn, resulting in many errors. During construction, it was found that the design did not match the actual situation, and the labor and materials were either too much or too little, and the budget was repeatedly increased. When repairing the large office and dormitory project, the old houses were not thoroughly inspected, and the budget was made and construction was urged. It was not until construction that omissions were discovered, and many materials were missed, and the project was completed after several budget increases. This guerrilla habit is very harmful.

    Engineering technicians in their work simply emphasized technology, without considering objective conditions and political impact, which also caused losses to the project. For example, when surveying and designing the water supply project line for the No. 4 Mine, they only emphasized technical issues such as straightening the line and hydraulic wear, and did not pay attention to the living habits of the masses. The project line had to pass through some cemeteries, and no solutions were proposed in advance in contact with the masses. After construction, it encountered serious obstacles, and the line was changed to bypass the tombs, adding more than 6,000 catties of millet in earthwork costs.

    The system is unsound, the organization is not strict, responsibilities are unclear, the construction is sloppy, and the quality of the project cannot be guaranteed.

    Some of the newly built dormitories in the No. 4 Mine were found to be leaking after completion, and some of the windows were found to be cracked. Other housing construction also caused many shortcomings due to sloppy construction. For example, in the fan room project, the large beam concave iron was not tightly combined with the large beam, causing the large beam to sink and affecting the cracks in the wall eaves; the large beam inspection of the headlamp room project and the Yugong Mine fan room project was not detailed enough during construction, and problems occurred before completion. Due to unclear division of labor and lack of a strict acceptance system, engineering technicians shirked their responsibilities during the acceptance of the fan room project. Individual supervisors even colluded with contractors to engage in corruption and bribery, encouraging contractors to cut corners. Although these problems have been dealt with, they have not been fundamentally resolved. Because we did not attach importance to basic construction work, we did not organize and lead it well, and did not conduct necessary education for cadres, and did not formulate necessary systems and regulations. Individual leading cadres even believed that civil construction was a seasonal temporary job and did not need to expand the organization and increase personnel.

    The ideological root cause of the mistakes is the eagerness for quick success and the lack of understanding of the rigor and complexity of basic construction.

    Based on the above inspection, we believe that the fundamental reason for the mistakes is that leading cadres are eager for quick success and emphasize the completion of tasks. Facts have proved that although we are very enthusiastic and willing to do more work and solve some urgent problems for production and employees, because we lack a correct understanding of the principles and policies of basic construction, do not understand the rigor, long-term nature and complexity of basic construction, and are not familiar with the formal business management methods, and at the same time, we have not carried out systematic education work among cadres, which makes the work divorced from our wishes and cannot satisfactorily achieve the ideal state. After this inspection, we believe that this eagerness for quick success is unrealistic and unscientific; our practice of wanting while doing is not in line with the principle of enterprise management. In order to effectively improve future work, we must learn from the lessons and strive to overcome this thinking and style. In future basic construction work, we must conduct detailed investigations and research, carefully design, and then construct; in terms of organization, we will organize special personnel to uniformly lead and manage, concentrate design personnel, and organize engineering teams to build projects ourselves. We will strengthen ideological education for engineering technicians and help them overcome the irresponsible work attitude of being careless, perfunctory, and getting by, and the work style of only emphasizing technology and not connecting with reality.

### 单凭热情和愿望是办不好基本建设的——阳泉矿务局一九五○年基本建设检查报告

    单凭热情和愿望是办不好基本建设的
    ——阳泉矿务局一九五○年基本建设检查报告
    人民日报七月六日发表了我局基本建设无人负责、浪费严重的报道后，我们根据政务院财政经济委员会关于严格检查基本建设工作的通知，并结合人民日报所报道的材料，对一九五○年的基本建设工程进行了检查，发现一九五○年我们的基本建设工作是有不少缺点的，有些缺点并且相当严重。缺点表现在以下几方面：
    计划不够周密，缺乏详细调查研究，造成了返工浪费。
    基本建设计划应该是按照需要依据实际情况加以调查、研究，作出设计图案，经过审查批准，然后施工。我们为了及早动工，及早领款，却是作起计划之后再行勘测，甚至是一面施工、一面设计，因而计划与实际脱节，不能按计划完工。如四矿火药库工程，根据安全生产需要，计划建筑在距生产井口三百公尺的地方。但我们对建筑地基实际情况没有作实地勘测，计划批准后便急于动工。直到施工时，才发现地面有裂缝，只得把已运去的石灰和石头迁移到另一地方。后来又因为建筑地址与新颁保安规程不符，只得再行迁移。同样，制订头灯房工程计划时没有很好地考虑地形，到施工时发现地形狭小，只好把原计划十一间改为七间；在位置安排上也考虑不周，未从发展观点着眼，便把头灯房建筑在西斜井口；假若以后发展西斜井，还需拆除一部。又如做四矿一百九十六米双拱涵洞工程计划时，只是以原已测定的铁路支线和各种土木建筑的发展扩大作根据，对于支线是否按测定路线动工？有无困难？可能发生什么问题？都没很好地与铁路局等有关方面联系研究。只是主观地认为支线是铁路局设计的，没有什么问题，就当成根据，开始了建筑。结果铁路支线计划改线，又与双拱涵洞工程发生直接冲突，使工程不能不因之停工等待解决。
    设计粗糙，不作实地勘测，未经审核即
    行动工，结果丢三拉四，屡次追加预算。
    我们对待设计工作的态度是不够严肃的，设计时缺少必要的勘察测量和计算，只凭经验和习惯来工作；加以没有组织专责审核人员担任审核，以致发生许多漏洞。如一九五○年大部房屋工程，只根据平面地形设计出房屋图样来，估计出一部分土石方费列在预算内，就算完成了设计工作，而没有实地勘测地形、计算土石方，没有绘制详尽细致的大样图和工程说明，因之发生许多错误。施工时发现设计与实际情况不符，工料非多即少，屡次追加预算。修理大办公室及宿舍工程时，对旧房未作澈底检查，便造了预算催着开了工。施工时才发现丢三拉四，遗漏了不少材料，几次追加预算才完成工程。这种游击习气，为害是很大的。
    工程技术人员在工作中单纯强调技术，不考虑客观情况和政治影响，也使工程遭到了损失。如测量设计四矿给水工程线路时，只强调了线路取直、水力磨损等技术问题，没有重视群众生活习惯，工程线路要经过一些坟地，而事先未与群众联系提出解决办法。施工后遇到严重阻碍，改线绕坟，追加土方费小米六千多斤。
    制度不健全，组织不严密，职责不明，施工草率，工程质量不能保证。
    四矿新建的宿舍，有的在完工后便发现漏雨，有的窗?发现裂缝。其他房屋建筑由于施工草率，也造成许多缺点。如风机房工程，大梁凹铁未与大梁坚密结合，以致大梁下沉，影响墙檐裂缝；头灯房工程及裕公矿风机房工程施工时对大梁检查不够详细，没有完工时便发生了毛病。由于分工不明，缺乏严格的验收制度，风机房工程在验收时，工程技术人员便互相推卸责任。个别监工人员甚至与包商勾结营私舞弊、贪图贿赂，助长了包商的偷工减料行为。这些问题虽然已经进行处理，但没有从根本上加以解决。由于我们没有重视基本建设工作，所以也没有很好地加以组织领导，对干部进行必要的教育，制定必要的制度和规程。个别领导干部甚至认为土木建筑是季节性的临时工作，不须扩大组织，增加人员。
    造成错误的思想根源是急于求成，不了解基本建设的严密性和复杂性。
    依据以上检查，我们认为造成错误的根本原因是领导干部急于求成，强调完成任务。事实证明：虽然我们抱着很大热情，愿意多作些工作，多为生产和职工解决些迫切需要解决的问题，但由于我们对基本建设的方针与政策缺乏正确的认识，不了解基本建设的严密性长远性和复杂性，不熟悉正规的经营管理方法，同时没有在干部中进行系统的教育工作，就使工作与愿望脱节，不能圆满地达到理想的境地。经过这次检查，我们认为这种急于求成的思想是不实际的，不科学的；我们这种一边作一边要的作法是不合乎经营企业化的原则的。为了切实改进今后的工作，我们要接受教训，努力克服这种思想和作风。今后进行基本建设工作时，一定要详细调查研究，周密设计，然后施工；在组织方面，我们将组织专人统一领导、管理，集中设计人员，并组织工程队自建工程。对工程技术人员，我们将加强思想教育，帮助他们克服粗枝大叶、敷衍塞责、得过且过的不负责任的工作态度和只强调技术、不联系实际的工作作风。
