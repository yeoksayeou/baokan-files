    New Cotton from Shandong Province Universally Enters the Market
    Provincial Finance Committee Work Teams Go to Fifteen Counties to Assist in Procurement
    Xinhua News Agency: New cotton in Shandong Province has universally entered the market, and cotton farmers are actively selling their new cotton to the state. In the southern counties of the Huimin Special District, where cotton matured earlier, large quantities of new cotton entered the market in late August. Gaoqing County (newly established county south of the Yellow River in Boxing County) cooperatives procured 170,000 jin of seed cotton on August 30th, and the procurement volume increased to 220,000 jin the next day. Boxing County had already completed 40% of its plan to procure 1,000,000 jin of new cotton from August 25th to September 5th by August 30th. In the cotton-producing centers of the Dezhou Special District, southern Dongguang County, and northern Wuqiao County, the procurement volume of new cotton has reached over 90% of the current cotton picked by farmers. In other areas where cotton matured later, new cotton also entered the market successively at the end of August. In order to strengthen leadership over the procurement of new cotton, the Shandong Provincial Finance and Economic Committee work teams (totaling 354 members) have been dispatched to fifteen counties under the jurisdiction of the Dezhou, Huimin, Tengxian, and Jiaozhou Special Districts to assist in the work. In Boxing County and other counties, the Communist Party County Committee Secretaries have also personally gone to the countryside to guide the procurement of new cotton.

    山东省新棉花普遍上市
    省财委工作队到十五县协助收购
    山东省新棉已普遍上市，棉农正纷纷向国家出售新棉。棉花成熟较早的惠民专区南部各县，八月下旬便有大批新棉上市。高青县（博兴县西黄河以南之新设县）合作社在八月三十日收购了籽棉十七万斤，第二天收购量增加到二十二万斤。博兴县自八月二十五日到九月五日收购新棉一百万斤的计划至八月三十日已完成百分之四十。德州专区的产棉中心东光县南部及吴桥县北部地区，新棉收购量已达目前棉农采摘量的百分之九十以上。在其他棉花成熟较晚的地区，新棉也都于八月底陆续上市。为了加强对新棉收购工作的领导，山东省财政经济委员会工作队（共有队员三百五十四人）已分赴德州、惠民、滕县、胶州四专区所属的十五个县协助工作。博兴等县中共县委书记也亲自下乡指导新棉收购工作。（新华社）
