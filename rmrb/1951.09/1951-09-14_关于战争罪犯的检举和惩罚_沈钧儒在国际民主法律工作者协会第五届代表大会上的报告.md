Regarding the Indictment and Punishment of War Criminals
    Report by Shen Junru at the Fifth Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers
    (6)
    Now I want to bring to your attention, and I especially want to ask everyone to pay attention to another serious phenomenon: Not only are the American imperialists sheltering and using Nazi war criminals in Europe, and sheltering and using Japanese war criminals in Asia, but they themselves are creating new war criminals. Since the Korean War broke out on June 25th last year, "American-brand" war criminals have not only shown their faces, but their ferocity, brutality, and cunning insidiousness have surpassed those of Nazi or Japanese war criminals.
    I am not deliberately exaggerating when I say this, but I have factual basis for it.
    Everyone remembers that when the Li Seung-man army launched an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 25th of last year, under the command and support of American imperialism, the United States ordered MacArthur within a few hours to immediately dispatch a large number of air forces and transport a large number of infantry from Japan to Korea by air. This Hitler-style "blitzkrieg" was completely predetermined, because a few days before, when Dulles inspected the 38th parallel, Li Seung-man's offensive and the strategy of US-Li military cooperation had already been decided. This unscrupulous behavior of American war criminals is exactly the same as Hitler's invasion of neighboring countries back then. The only difference is that American war criminals are more cunning than the Hitler gang.
    The Korean War is a civil war in international law, but this unbridled American intervention, no matter what banner it flies or what name it steals, is undoubtedly aggression. Professor Muszkat, a learned scholar, has already thoroughly discussed this issue in his long essay published in the first issue of this association in 1950. I don't need to say more.
    Another unforgivable crime of American war criminals is the invasion of China. As everyone knows, at the beginning of the Korean War, the United States immediately ordered the occupation of Taiwan, a part of China's sacred territory. This is a typical Hitler-style aggression.
    In addition to occupying the territory of the People's Republic of China, the United States has also violated Chinese airspace countless times in the past year. Before December 25th of last year, the US Air Force had invaded Chinese airspace 200 times, dispatching more than 1,000 aircraft. By the end of last year, the US Air Force had intruded into China a total of 328 times, dispatching a total of 1,406 aircraft. From January to August 3 of this year, the US Air Force has invaded Chinese airspace 59 times, dispatching 358 aircraft. As a result of these American aircraft's arbitrary strafing and bombing, many Chinese people have suffered casualties.
    No matter what reasons are used as excuses for these war criminals' acts of seizing Chinese territory and violating Chinese airspace, they cannot conceal the naked aggression!
    "Aggression," as we have repeatedly pointed out earlier, is the most serious of all war crimes in today's international law. It is the "greatest crime." All those who participate in this crime should be indicted and punished as "Class A war criminals." Therefore, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the fate of those few people in the United States who are now complacent in planning and executing wars of aggression will be no different from that of Goering, Ribbentrop, Tojo, and Itagaki in history.
    Here, I must also point out that the United States is not only creating war criminals of aggression and seriously committing the crime of undermining peace, but it is also creating war criminals of atrocity, committing large-scale crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war on the Korean battlefield!
    In the Korean War, the American imperialists used almost every weapon except the atomic bomb, including poison gas and bacteria. Their bombing targets included civilians, civilian residences, hospitals, schools, temples, and churches. Their massacre targets were defenseless civilians, including women and children.
    I don’t intend to enumerate the atrocities committed by the US-Li army in Korea, because that would take a very, very long time. I think that anyone who has read the several telegrams sent to the United Nations by Foreign Minister Park Hon-yong of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the several communiques issued by the Investigation Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea will know what the US military is doing in Korea.
    But, friends, I want to solemnly introduce to you the most comprehensive, most just, and most recently published report, which is the report of the International Democratic Women's Federation delegation that investigated the atrocities of the US military in Korea on July 4.
    This report is written entirely based on facts and figures from on-the-spot investigations. The head of the delegation is Nora Rodd, an outstanding Canadian woman.
    Time does not allow me to introduce the content of this report, although it is extremely valuable information for us. Therefore, here, I will only briefly quote a few paragraphs from its simple and powerful conclusion regarding the inhumane atrocities committed by the US military in Korea:
    "1. Systematic destruction of food, food warehouses and food factories. Systematically burning forests, mature grains and fruit trees with incendiary bombs. Strafing farmers working in the fields and draught animals with machine guns from low-flying aircraft. As a result, all the people of Korea are bound to suffer from hunger.
    2. Systematic extermination of city after city, village after village; in many of which it is impossible to imagine military targets or industrial centers.
    3. Planned use of weapons prohibited by international law against peaceful residents, such as: incendiary bombs, gasoline bombs, cluster bombs, time bombs, while aircraft continue to strafe peaceful residents at low altitude.
    4. Inhuman extermination of Korean residents. In areas temporarily occupied by the US military and the Li Seung-man army, hundreds of thousands of peaceful residents, from the elderly to infants, were tortured, burned to death, beaten to death, and buried alive. In addition, thousands upon thousands of people were imprisoned in crowded prisons without charges, without investigation, without trial, and without sentencing, leaving them to starve and freeze to death.
    This large-scale massacre and torture exceeds the crimes committed by the Hitler Nazi bandits when they occupied Europe."
    Friends, please pay special attention to the sentence I just read:
    "This large-scale massacre and torture exceeds the crimes committed by the Hitler Nazi bandits when they occupied Europe." I should add, it also exceeds the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialist aggressors in China.
    Regarding the issue of responsibility for atrocities, the report's conclusion is not only insightful and thorough, but also fully in line with the principles of jurisprudence, which deserves our special attention. It says:
    "All the evidence provided by peaceful residents in their conversations confirms that almost all of these crimes were carried out by American officers and soldiers, or were carried out under the orders of American officers. Therefore, the full responsibility for these crimes should be borne by the senior commanders of the United States in Korea, that is, by General MacArthur, General Ridgway, and other commanders of the troops who call themselves the United Nations forces that invaded Korea. Although these atrocities were carried out according to the orders of the generals in combat, the governments of all countries that sent troops to Korea and all governments that voted in the United Nations in favor of the war against Korea should bear full responsibility."
    (7)
    In this brief report, I have pointed out that since World War II, the concept of "war crimes" has greatly developed in international law, and therefore the scope of our indictment and punishment of "war criminals" has also expanded a lot.
    I have also pointed out that since the end of World War II, we have indeed achieved some commendable achievements in war crimes trials.
    However, in the past two or three years, due to the urgent need of American imperialism's so-called "global strategic plan" to arm West Germany and Japan, and to collude with the German and Japanese reactionaries, it has not only prevented our further achievements, but is also destroying the achievements we have already obtained.
    In Europe, it is recklessly releasing and using large numbers of Nazi war criminals, making them serve its plan for European mercenary armies; in Asia, it is not only releasing Japanese war criminals batch after batch, but is also actively employing them as accomplices in its aggression against the Asian people.
    At the same time, I have also pointed out that American imperialism is not only releasing and using old war criminals from Germany and Japan, but it is also creating new American war criminals itself. Its aggression against Korea and China, as well as the appalling atrocities it has committed in the Korean War, prove that it is completely imitating the model of Nazi Germany and fascist Japan, and is completely following the old path of Hitler and Tojo.
    This arrogant and absurd behavior of the United States is a complete contempt for international law and international justice. It is a grave insult to the people of all countries who jointly fought against German and Japanese fascism, especially the military and civilians who sacrificed their lives to defeat the German and Japanese bandits. At the same time, it is also a serious threat to the democratic order and world peace.
    Therefore, I believe that from the standpoint of our democratic legal workers, we must:
    1. Severely condemn the US government's act of arbitrarily releasing German and Japanese war criminals and using German and Japanese war criminals, and insist on the international agreement on the trial of war criminals. The people of the world who love justice and peace, including the American people, should unite to oppose this absurd behavior of the US government that violates international agreements.
    2. Solemnly warn the US government to make it understand that anyone who encourages, plans, or participates in a war of aggression, or engages in any atrocities on the battlefield, will be listed as a war criminal and will be severely punished by law.
    Our condemnation and warning will undoubtedly receive a warm response from peace-loving and democratic people all over the world (including the American people), and they will unite to fight against the mad attempt of American imperialists to push the world into the abyss of destruction and ruin!
    There are many items on the agenda of this conference, and they are all important and urgent issues that require our careful study and discussion.
    Among these agenda items, I think there are several that are directly related to the issue of dealing with war criminals. They are:
    1. Define "aggression." Since aggression is the greatest war crime, the definition of aggression must be clearly defined in law.
    2. Ban war propaganda. War propaganda is undoubtedly part of war preparation. We should subject the propagandists and clamorers of aggressive wars to the same indictment and punishment as the criminals who launched and carried out aggressive wars.
    3. Prohibit the use of atomic, bacterial, and chemical weapons. The Stockholm Declaration has already declared the prohibition of atomic bombs and regarded the first user of atomic bombs as a war criminal. But it is not enough to ban only atomic bombs. We must confirm the use of bacterial and chemical weapons as illegal, and stipulate that those who use any of them will be regarded as war criminals and will be subject to indictment and punishment for war crimes.
    I know that the above issues will definitely be discussed in detail and carefully at this conference. I hereby solemnly raise them and ask the association to give them special consideration.
    Finally, let me wish the conference complete success! (To be continued)
    (Note: In the fifth line of the third paragraph of (1) in this article, "winter of 1947 in Nanjing..." should be corrected to "winter of 1937 in Nanjing...")

    关于战争罪犯的检举和惩罚
    沈钧儒在国际民主法律工作者协会第五届代表大会上的报告
    （六）
    现在我要向你们提出而且要请大家特别注意的是另一个严重的现象，那便是：美帝国主义者不但在欧洲包庇和利用纳粹战犯，在亚洲包庇和利用日本战犯，而且它自己正在制造新的战犯。自去年六月二十五日朝鲜战争发生以来，“美国牌”的战犯们不但已经显露头角，而且他们所表现的凶狠、残暴和狡黠阴险，较之纳粹战犯或日本战犯，有过之无不及。
    我说这话并非故意夸大，而是有其事实根据的。
    大家还记得；当去年六月二十五日李承晚军队在美帝国主义指挥和支持之下发动进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的时候，美国在几小时内，便命令了麦克阿瑟马上派遣大量空军并用空运从日本运去大量步兵到朝鲜去作战。这个类似希特勒式的“闪击战”是完全预定好了的，因为在此前数天当杜勒斯视察三八线的时候，李承晚的进攻以及美李军事合作的战略都早已决定了。美国战犯们这种肆无顾忌的做法，完全与当年希特勒侵占邻邦的做法相同。所不同的只是美国战犯们是比希特勒匪帮更加狡黠而已。
    朝鲜战争在国际法上是内战，但是美国这种肆无忌惮的干涉，无论它打着什么旗帜，盗用什么名义，都无疑地是侵略。关于这一问题，博学的墨斯加脱（Muszkat）教授在本会的一九五○年出版的第一期刊物上所发表的那篇长论文里已有透彻的讨论，我不必多说。
    美国战犯们最不可宽恕的另一罪行，是对中国的侵略。大家都知道：在朝鲜战争发生之初，美国便立刻下令侵占了中国神圣领土之一部分的台湾。这完全是希特勒典型的侵略。
    除了侵占中华人民共和国领土之外，美国在这一年之内还无数次侵犯了中国领空。去年十二月二十五日以前，美国空军就已侵犯了中国领空达二百次，出动飞机在一千架以上，到去年年底为止，美国空军，侵入中国总共是三百二十八次，出动飞机共一千四百○六架。自今年一月至八月三日，美国空军又侵犯了中国领空五十九次，出动飞机达三百五十八架。由于这些美国飞机的任意扫射和轰炸，很多中国人民遭受了伤亡。
    这些战犯们强占中国领土和侵犯中国领空的行为，无论以任何理由为藉口，都不能掩饰它是赤裸裸的侵略！
    “侵略”，正如我们前面所一再指出，在今日国际法上是一切战争犯罪中最严重的一种。它是“最大的犯罪”。凡是参加这种犯罪的人们，都应该以“甲级战犯”去检举、去惩罚。因此，我们不难想像到：美国的那些正在洋洋得意、策划和执行侵略战争的少数人们，他们在历史上的命运和戈林、里宾特洛甫、东条、板垣之流，也不会两样。
    这里，我还必须要指出的是：美国不但要制造侵略战犯，正在严重地犯着破坏和平的罪行，而且它也正在制造暴行战犯，在朝鲜战场上大规模地犯着违反人道和违反交战法规与惯例的罪行！
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜战争中，除了原子弹之外，几乎什么武器都用过了，其中包括毒气和细菌。他们的轰炸目标包括平民、平民住宅、医院、学校、庙宇与教堂。他们的屠杀目标是毫无抵抗的平民，包括妇女和儿童。
    我不打算细数美李军在朝鲜犯下的种种暴行，因为那是需要很长很长的时间的。我想，凡是读过朝鲜人民民主主义共和国朴宪永外相几次致联合国的通电和朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线调查委员会所发表的那几号公报的人们，都会知道美军在朝鲜干的是什么勾当了。
    但是，朋友们，我要郑重向你们介绍一个最全面、最公正、而且是最近发表的报告，那便是七月四日的调查美军在朝鲜暴行的国际民主妇联代表团的报告。
    这个报告完全根据实地调查的事实和数字而写成的，代表团的主席是诺拉·罗德（Nora    Rodd），一位加拿大的杰出的女士。
    时间不允许我介绍这个报告的内容，虽然它对我们说来，都是极端有价值的资料。因此，在这里，我只就它那简单而且有力的结论中关于美军在朝鲜所进行惨无人道的种种暴行的几段，扼要引读一下：
    “一、有计划地毁灭粮食、粮食仓库和粮食工厂。有系统地用燃烧弹烧毁森林、成熟的谷物和果木树。以低空俯冲的飞机的机枪扫射在田地里劳作的农民和耕畜。这样一来，全朝鲜人民都势必要受到饥饿。
    二、有计划地消灭一城又一城，一村又一村；其中许多地方是无论如何也难以设想是军事目标或工业中心的。
    三、对和平居民有计划地使用国际公法所禁用的武器如：燃烧弹、汽油弹、母子弹、定时炸弹，同时飞机还继续不断地低飞扫射和平居民。
    四、惨无人道地消灭朝鲜居民。在暂时遭到美国军和李承晚军队侵占的地区，有数十万的和平居民，全家从老人到婴孩都遭受到拷打、烧死、打死、活埋。此外还把成千成万的人，没有罪状，不经调查，不经审讯，不经判决地关在拥挤的监狱里，让他们饿死和冻死。
    这种大规模的屠杀和拷打，超过了希特勒纳粹匪徒占领欧洲时所做的罪行。”
    朋友们，请特别注意我刚才读的那一句：
    “这种大规模的屠杀和拷打，超过了希特勒纳粹匪徒占领欧洲时所做的罪行。”我应该加上一句，也超过了日本帝国主义侵略者在中国所犯的罪行。
    关于暴行责任问题，报告的结论不但警辟透彻，而且完全符合法理学的原则，值得我们特别重视。它说：
    “所有和平居民在谈话中所提供的证据，都证实这一切罪行差不多全部是由美国官兵执行的，或且是在美国军官命令之下执行的。因此，这些罪行的全部责任应该由美国在朝鲜的高级指挥官担负，就是由麦克阿瑟将军、李奇微将军和其他自称为联合国军的侵略朝鲜的军队指挥官们负责。虽然这些兽行是按照作战的将军们的命令执行的，但是派遣军队赴朝鲜的各国政府以及所有在联合国内投票赞成对朝鲜作战的政府都应该负全部责任。”（七）
    在我这篇粗简的报告里，我指出了：在第二次世界大战以后，“战罪”概念在国际法上已经有了很大发展，因而我们对于“战犯”们检举和惩罚的范围也就扩大了许多。
    我又曾指出：在第二次世界大战结束以后，事实上我们对于战犯审判，也曾经获得了一些值得称道的成就。
    但是最近两三年来，由于美帝国主义的所谓“全球性的战略计划”需要急于武装西德和日本，需要勾结德日反动派，它不但阻止了我们更进一步的成就，而且正在毁灭我们已经获得的那些成就。
    在欧洲，它正在毫无顾忌地大量释放并利用纳粹战犯，使他们服务于它底欧洲雇佣军的计划；在亚洲，它不但一批又一批地释放了日本战犯，而且在积极的起用着他们做它侵略亚洲人民的帮凶。
    同时，我又曾指出：美帝国主义不但释放和利用德、日的旧的战犯，而且它自己正在制造美国的新的战犯。它对朝鲜和中国的侵略，以及它在朝鲜战争中骇人听闻的暴行，都证明着它完全是在摹仿纳粹德国和法西斯日本的典型，完全走上了希特勒和东条的老道。
    美国的这种狂妄荒谬行为是对国际法和国际正义的完全蔑视。它是对共同对德日法西斯作战同盟各国的人民重大侮辱，尤其对那些为战胜德日匪帮而牺牲了生命的军民的重大侮辱。同时，它也是对民主秩序和世界和平的严重威胁。
    因此，我认为站在我们民主法学工作者的立场，我们必须：
    一、严厉地谴责美国政府擅自释放德日战犯和利用德日战犯的行为，坚持审判战犯的国际协议。全世界爱好正义和平的人民包括美国人民，共同起来反对美国政府的这种违反国际协议的荒谬行为。
    二、郑重的警告美国政府，使它明白：凡无论是鼓励、策划或参加侵略战争，或从事于战场上的任何暴行的人们，都将被列为战犯，受到法律的严厉制裁。
    我们的这种谴责和警告无疑的将获得全世界爱好和平民主的人民（包括美国人民在内）的热烈响应，他们将一致奋起，以共同的努力，去打击美帝国主义者要把世界推到破坏和毁灭的深渊里去的疯狂企图！
    本届会议议程上的项目很多，它们都是些重要和迫切的问题，都需要我们细心的研究和讨论。
    在这些议程的项目之中，我认为有几个是和处置战犯问题有直接关系的。它们是：
    一、确定“侵略”的定义。侵略既是最大的战争犯罪，侵略的定义在法律上必须明确规定。
    二、取缔战争宣传。战争宣传无疑地是战争准备的一部分。我们应该使侵略战争的宣传者和叫嚣者与发动和执行侵略战争的犯人们同样的受到检举和惩罚。
    三、禁止使用原子、细菌、化学的武器。斯德哥尔摩宣言已经宣布了禁用原子弹，并把第一个使用原子弹者视为战犯。但只禁原子弹还是不够，我们必须确认细菌、化学的武器的使用为非法，并规定使用其中任何一种的人们都会被视为战犯，受到对战犯的检举和惩罚。
    以上几个问题，我知道在本届会议里必定有详细缜密的讨论，我这里郑重地提出，请本会加以特别考虑。
    最后，让我预祝本届会议的完全成功！（续完）
    （按：本文（一）第三段第五行“一九四七年冬在南京……”应更正为“一九三七年冬在南京……”。）
