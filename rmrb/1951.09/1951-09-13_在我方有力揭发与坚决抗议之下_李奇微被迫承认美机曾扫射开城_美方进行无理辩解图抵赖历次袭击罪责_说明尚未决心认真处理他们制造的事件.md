Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Under the forceful exposure and firm protest of the Chinese and Korean sides, the U.S. side was forced to admit the fact that U.S. aircraft illegally strafed the Kaesong neutral zone on September 10th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 11th, Ridgway Headquarters issued a communique on the evening of the 11th, admitting that the aircraft that intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone and conducted strafing attacks near the meeting site at 1:35 PM on September 10th were U.S. aircraft. Ridgway Headquarters also released a notification from the U.S. Chief Representative Joy to our Chief Representative General Nam Il.

The U.S. side was forced to admit for the first time the fact of violating the Kaesong neutralization agreement, but at the same time, attempted to conceal other parts of the facts. The communique from Ridgway Headquarters and Joy's notification both tried their best to defend this new planned provocative incident by the U.S. side, claiming it was "due to the (U.S. aircraft) pilot's navigational error, which caused a mistake," and arguing that this premeditated incident was confirmed based on "radar reconnaissance" and "the pilot's report." Joy's notification stated: "The United Nations Command Air Force Command has reported to the United Nations Chief Representative that at approximately 1:30 PM on September 10th, radar detected an aircraft in the Kaesong area. After continuous radar reconnaissance of the aircraft, and in conjunction with the usual identification methods, it was known that the aircraft belonged to the United Nations Command. Later, an investigation of the pilot revealed that he had conducted an aerial strafing attack at approximately 1:35 PM on a target that he mistakenly identified due to a navigational error. Based on this information and the investigation conducted by the United Nations Command, the strafing from the air within the Kaesong neutral zone on September 10th is hereby acknowledged." In the notification, Joy disregarded the fact that the U.S. aircraft's strafing damaged Kaesong residents' homes and endangered the lives of some Kaesong residents, insisting that the U.S. aircraft's "attack did not cause any damage."

The purpose of the U.S. side's above-mentioned defense is clearly to attempt to deny the premeditated nature of this attack and to attempt to use this perfunctory admission to deny that the past series of attacks on the Kaesong neutral zone were all made by the U.S. side. The U.S. side's attitude shows that they have not yet decided to seriously and responsibly handle the series of serious provocative incidents they have created.

    在我方有力揭发与坚决抗议之下
    李奇微被迫承认美机曾扫射开城
    美方进行无理辩解图抵赖历次袭击罪责
    说明尚未决心认真处理他们制造的事件
    【新华社十二日讯】美国方面在中朝方面的有力揭发与坚决抗议之下，被迫承认美国飞机在九月十日非法扫射开城中立区的事实。据美联社东京十一日电：李奇微总部于十一日晚发表公报，承认九月十日一时三十五分侵入开城中立区上空对会址附近地区进行扫射攻击的飞机，是美国的飞机。李奇微总部并发表了美方首席代表乔埃给我方首席代表南日将军的通知。
    美方被迫第一次承认破坏开城中立化协议的事实，但同时企图隐瞒事实的其他部分。李奇微总部的公报和乔埃的通知，都竭力辩解美方这一新的有计划的挑衅事件，是“由于（美国飞机）驾驶员的航行差错，因而造成了错误”，并且辩解这一预谋的事件是根据“雷达侦察”和“驾驶员的报告”才获得证实的。乔埃的通知说：“联合国军司令部空军指挥部已向联合国军首席代表报告，九月十日约一时三十分，经雷达发现在开城地区有飞机一架。经对该机作连续雷达侦察、并配合通常的识别方法，已知该飞机是联合国军司令部所属飞机之一。后来向驾驶员调查，发现他曾在约一时三十五分向因为航行差错而被他误认的目标作空中扫射攻击。根据这一情报以及联合国军司令部所进行的调查，对九月十日开城中立地区界内被自空中扫射一节予以承认。”乔埃在通知中不顾美机此次扫射损毁开城居民房屋及使若干开城居民险遭杀害的事实，硬说美国飞机对开城中立区的“这次袭击并未造成毁损”。
    美方进行上述辩解的目的，显然是企图抵赖此次袭击事件的预谋性质，并企图用这次的轻描淡写的承认，来抵赖过去一连串的袭击开城中立区的事件，都不是美方制造的。美方的态度，说明他们直到现在还未决心认真负责地来处理他们所制造的历次严重挑衅事件。
