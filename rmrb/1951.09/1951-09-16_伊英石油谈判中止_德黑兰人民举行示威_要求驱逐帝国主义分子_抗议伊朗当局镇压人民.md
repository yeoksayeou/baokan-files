(Dispatch from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: The negotiations between the Iranian and British governments regarding the oil issue ended on August 22nd without any results. Stokes, the head of the British negotiating delegation, flew back to London from Tehran by plane on August 23rd. The breakdown of the negotiations was due to the Iranian government's rejection of the British suggestions, which violated the Iranian law on the nationalization of oil. As everyone knows, these Anglo-Iranian negotiations were brokered by Harriman. The breakdown of the negotiations shows that the United States' schemes in Iran have failed. Harriman has publicly admitted that his "efforts" did not achieve "concrete results" and expressed his "regret." Nevertheless, British and American imperialism have not given up their ambitions to plunder Iranian oil rights. Harriman left Tehran for Belgrade on the 24th, preparing to go to London from there to discuss the matter further with the British government. Before leaving Tehran, he said that the plan he proposed could still serve as the basis for negotiations.

After the breakdown of the Anglo-Iranian oil negotiations, about 30,000 working people from Tehran and its suburbs held a demonstration rally in a square outside Tehran on August 24th. The conference was organized by the National Association for the Struggle Against Imperialist Oil Companies in Iran. The masses unanimously passed a resolution demanding the expulsion of representatives of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company from the Iranian oil industry and stopping the ruling clique's attempts to compromise with the imperialists. The conference also resolved to protest against the Iranian reactionaries and the Iranian authorities for oppressing the Iranian people, demanding freedom of action for all political parties and trade unions, and demanding the release of political prisoners, etc.

Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh delivered a radio address on September 1st. After stating "the resistance and will shown by the Iranian people in the sacred struggle over the Iranian oil issue," Mossadegh said: The "effective measures" taken so far have led to the complete abolition of foreign oil concessions in southern Iran, which were to expire in fifty years. Mossadegh said: The British government still wants to preserve some of the privileges that Britain acquired in Iran by force in the past and is not prepared to treat Iran equally. But the Iranian government is well aware that it cannot escape the responsibility of meeting the people's demands. After recounting the negotiations between the Iranian government and the delegation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the British government delegation headed by Stokes, and Harriman, Mossadegh said: The Iranian government could not agree to their proposals. Mossadegh emphasized: "My government is fully determined to implement the measures it has set and the policies it adheres to."

    伊英石油谈判中止
    德黑兰人民举行示威
    要求驱逐帝国主义分子
    抗议伊朗当局镇压人民
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：伊朗和英国政府关于石油问题的谈判，未获任何结果而于八月二十二日宣告中止。英国谈判代表团团长斯托克斯已于八月二十三日乘机自德黑兰飞返伦敦。谈判的中止，是由于伊朗政府拒绝了英方违反伊朗石油国有化法的建议。大家知道，英伊双方这次谈判是由哈里曼一手撮合的。谈判的中止，说明美国在伊朗的计谋已遭到失败。哈里曼已公开承认他的“努力”没有获得“具体结果”而感到“遗憾”。虽然如此，英美帝国主义并未因此放弃他们掠夺伊朗石油权的野心。哈里曼已在二十四日离德黑兰赴贝尔格莱德，准备从那里赴伦敦与英国政府再事讨论。他在离德黑兰前说，他提出的方案仍可作为谈判的基础。
    伊英石油谈判中止后，德黑兰及其近郊的劳动人民约三万人，于八月二十四日在德黑兰城外的广场举行示威大会。大会是由伊朗反对帝国主义石油公司斗争全国协会组织的。与会群众一致通过决议，要求驱逐伊朗石油工业中的前英伊石油公司的代表，并制止统治集团与帝国主义者妥协的企图。大会并决议抗议伊朗反动派与伊朗当局压迫伊朗人民，要求各政党与工会有行动的自由，要求释放政治犯等。
    伊朗首相摩萨台于九月一日发表广播演说。摩萨台在申述“伊朗人民在伊朗石油问题的神圣斗争中所表现的反抗与意志”后说：到目前为止所采取的“有效措施”，已经导向完全废除外国在伊朗南部的要五十年才满期的石油开采权。摩萨台说：英国政府还想保存一些英国过去用武力在伊朗取得的特权，还不准备平等地对待伊朗。但伊朗政府十分明白：它不能逃避满足人民要求的责任。摩萨台在追述伊朗政府先后和英伊石油公司代表团、以斯托克斯为首的英国政府代表团及哈里曼等谈判的情形后说：伊朗政府不能同意他们的建议。摩萨台强调说：“我的政府完全有决心实行它订定的措施和它所坚持的政策。”
