Learning from the Creation of "Victory of the Chinese People"
Liu Baiyu

Because of my involvement in literary work, I participated in the filming of "Victory of the Chinese People." Therefore, regarding film production technology, I only made a preliminary contact and understanding, and I am not yet able to summarize any experience. However, the production process of this film did have a great educational effect on me.

When I accepted this task, I had just come from the combat troops. I was very excited when I heard that I was going to cooperate with Soviet artists to create a color film reflecting the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. Of course, we knew that the task before us was a major and arduous project. But as long as we thought that what we were doing would be a patriotic work and also an internationalist work, a work not only for the Chinese people, but also for all peace-loving people in the world, we would have the courage and determination. I remember the initial meeting with the Soviet director, Varramov, Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and our Soviet companions. The words we said at that time, when I think about them today, are all vows of work: "We will tell the world how the Chinese people defeated the enemy!" "We will tell the world how the Chinese people obtained peace and happiness!" "Our work is determined by Stalin and Mao Zedong, and we must do it well." The comrades of our working group carried out their work with such a vow.

On the day Ambassador Roshchin presented the Stalin Prize on behalf of the Stalin Prize Committee, I said: "From the perspective of this artistic creation—'Victory of the Chinese People'—I feel that this honor should be attributed to the advanced Soviet artists cultivated by Stalin. Only through the hands of comrades such as Varramov, Simonov, Lukinsky, and Gushev can the heroic struggle be given a heroic artistic form in the field of film art. We are learning from them at all times in our work." These are my heartfelt words of gratitude. Whether in the actual filming locations in China or in the workshops of the Moscow Documentary Film Studio, I felt that every Soviet comrade was so enthusiastic, deeply implying the internationalist feelings of close brothers. Varramov, the director who had been tested in the war, said when we talked about the Chinese people: "Before the revolution, the land of China was vast, and the farmers loved the land, but the land they owned themselves occupied such a small part of the vast land. They only cultivated that small piece of land with a lifetime of blood and sweat, one seed, one seed, to feed themselves. This shows the farmers' love for the land on the one hand, and the poverty of the rural economy on the other. In the cities, there is a contrast between the huge buildings of imperialism and the slums. Now we must announce to the world how the Chinese people have achieved victory." From his words, one can hear his deep sympathy and love for the Chinese working people. Lukinsky, a new person cultivated under the socialist system, who became an artist from a railway car repair worker, his loyal sense of responsibility, meticulous, thorough, and diligent work style are an important guarantee for completing the work tasks. Gushev—the eldest brother in the working group, who once personally filmed documentary films of the great Lenin himself, he is always like gentle sunshine, educating his assistants, young Chinese apprentices. Everyone who has seen "Victory of the Chinese People" feels that the film's narration is simply a long poem praising heroic China. I remember seeing Simonov the day after arriving in Moscow. When watching the initial work copy in the screening room, he sat beside me, and as tens of thousands of feet of film turned, he enthusiastically talked about his draft, saying that here we should narrate like this, and there we should narrate like that. In short, I feel that the great and sublime spirit of internationalism is a major reason for the victory of our work. A sincere love for the Chinese people and a correct understanding of the relationship between the achievements of the Chinese revolution and the struggles of the people of the world sparked enthusiastic sparks in our work. But enthusiasm alone is not enough to complete the work. Soviet artists combine a serious sense of responsibility with a spirit of collectivism in their work style. Everything is for doing the job well, this is the highest principle. For this, you can discuss, even argue. Only after arguing, finding the truth, and promoting the work, will everyone feel truly happy. This is a concrete embodiment of a good style of criticism and self-criticism in practical work. Because of this, in our work, that kind of decadent bourgeois artist's individualistic, uncriticizable, and undiscussable remnant of thought is not allowed to exist, and our goal is very clear. Because our work will be a holistic work, it will be a struggle and a victory on the front line of defending the world peace struggle, and the artist's responsibility is to serve this struggle and victory.

From the perspective of artistic creation, it is not easy to express the historical facts of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people in eight thousand feet of film. The first requires a great ability of artistic generalization, and the second requires highly artistic expression skills. In this regard, we also defined the task of summarizing history for ourselves. Once, when Varramov and I were traveling and studying our work, we said: "The war is for the future happiness. The blood is not shed in vain. This film of ours is partly what the writer wants to say, partly what the hero wants to say, and finally peace and victory—everything is for victory." This is not only a historical process, but also the guiding ideology of our creation. Since it is an artistic generalization, we immediately touched on the question of how to vividly express the struggle of Chinese heroes. In art, great socialist realism requires us to grasp, express, and praise the essence of the Chinese people's heroes, and to express the light of the future. We want to create a work full of heroic brilliance. To achieve this goal, the real beginning of our creation was to learn from the actual struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

This learning was carried out under the guidance of the party and military leadership. First of all, our creative outline was only finalized after repeated detailed revisions under the direct organization, assistance, and review of the leading organs. At the same time, from the outline of the major battlefield to each specific campaign and battle, we listened to reports, made records, and also collected a considerable amount of written materials. During this period, we almost came into contact with all the major aspects of the Liberation War. When we were actually filming a certain part of the war film, we would first get the personal assistance of the commander of this campaign and directly guide the organization, and then interview cadres, soldiers, or military reporters, and then make a detailed plan for this part. The work plan was the result of our learning, and then we used it to guide our actual work, and finally this detailed plan was transformed into one shot after another. In the actual work stage, I should talk about two touching facts: on the one hand, the commanders and combatants of our troops not only gave our film crew a warm welcome, but more importantly, they enriched the content of the film with their unparalleled courage and wisdom and sublime spirit of self-sacrifice. The honor we have gained should belong to them, because they are the true creators and stars of the "Victory of the Chinese People." Without them, this film could not have been made. On the other hand, the Soviet directors and photographers, their fighting enthusiasm was integrated with the fighting enthusiasm of the troops on the production site. As long as there was work to do, they often did not eat all day and worked until dark before returning. At this moment, if anyone asked them to rest, they would be unhappy and say: "We are here to work, not to rest." I found the touching thing about Soviet artists is that their joy and happiness lies in selfless work and beneficial labor for the people. Creation is the result of labor.

The great motherland, the heroic struggle of the great motherland, requires us to consider that this color film should not only be full of heroic brilliance, but also full of optimism. We paid attention to how to realize this attempt in the filming, explanation, and music. As a result, "Victory of the Chinese People" actually expressed the Chinese people's overwhelming heroic spirit. I feel that Soviet photographers have made extremely valuable contributions in this regard. They created many solemn and beautiful pictures and lovely heroic images for "Victory of the Chinese People." Even the face of an ordinary soldier is so lovable and unforgettable forever. The reason for this is that the photographer artistically selected the shots. He not only obtained the surface of the image, but more importantly, he was good at selecting the moving image substance that can reflect the essence and heroic brilliance of our heroes.

The most important editing and recording work of this film was carried out in Moscow. The resounding sentence "Beijing—Moscow" has special significance for our work. Our work began in Beijing and was completed in Moscow. Isn't this very commemorative? This final stage of work went through repeated reviews, analysis and revisions. Varramov, Lukinsky, and we, once divided the entire film into more than a dozen parts, carefully reviewed each part, and put forward opinions. At that time, we sometimes had to work in the screening room for twelve hours in one breath, and then collect dozens of different large and small suggestions for research, discussion, and even to revise the film. Simonov's film commentary was also reviewed and revised again and again by the film studio and the film department before it was finalized. Looking back now, only this serious and scientific work attitude gradually created this huge historical film. The first time the completed film was test screened in the large screening room of the Moscow Documentary Film Studio, when the struggle and life of the Chinese people was vividly presented on the screen, I remember that my mood was very excited at that time, but we did not immediately sing the praises of our work ourselves, because the success or failure of a work of art is to be decided by millions of ordinary viewers. However, from this creative work, the working methods of Soviet film artists gave me great inspiration. Turning the rich real struggle life into artistic creation is a very scientific and meticulous work. Only when you have generalized and grasped the essence of life, and then completed your structure through the expression of artistic images, can the diverse real life be organized, come alive, be highlighted, and have brilliance. And the key to all of this lies in learning. Learning is the real beginning of our creation. Learning guarantees the progress of our work. What I am particularly interested in in film creation is that it is never an individual's creation, and each individual's creation always belongs to the overall creation. Film creation requires every participant to have a clear and unified creative idea, a serious sense of responsibility, and a spirit of collectivism. Thinking of these experiences, I feel that in the major creative work that Chinese artists are about to carry out, we are very much in need of a spirit of collectivism in creation.

I flew back to Beijing from Moscow with the first copy in early August last year, and now it is exactly one year. "Victory of the Chinese People" gave the imperialists a serious blow, because the appearance of this film on screens in various countries and regions is a declaration to the world: The Chinese people are invincible. We, united with the great Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of all countries, will become a powerful force for defending peace and will crush the aggressive wars of the US imperialists. Because of this contribution to the cause of striving for world peace, it has won the warm love and welcome of the people of the world. I feel that this is not accidental. This is the result of it expressing the glorious and splendid revolutionary history created by the Chinese people. This is the result of the leadership and care of this project by the great Marshal Stalin and the great Chairman Mao Zedong. This is the result of the participation and assistance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This is the result of the joint efforts of Soviet and Chinese artists. As one of the workers who made "Victory of the Chinese People" and won the honor of the Stalin Prize for Literature and Art, I feel very honored, but I know that this harvest is the harvest of the Chinese people, the harvest of the Chinese art world, and the harvest of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. As for the work I have done personally in the field of literature and art, it is only a beginning. Now, the new China unfolds before us a great and rich prospect of real life. We should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line and strive to express the great themes of patriotism and defending world peace.

    从“中国人民的胜利”创作中学习
    刘白羽
    我以从事文学工作的关系，参加拍制“中国人民的胜利”，因此关于电影制作技术方面问题，我只做到初步的接触与理解，还谈不到总结什么经验。不过，这部片子的制作经过，确实对我起了很大的教育作用。
    接受这个任务的时候，我刚刚从作战部队中来。我听说要同苏联艺术家合作，创作一部反映中国人民英勇斗争的五彩电影片，我心里非常兴奋。当然我们知道摆在我们面前的任务，是一项重大而艰巨的工程。但只要我们想到，我们所做的将是一项爱国主义的工作，也是一项国际主义的工作，这工作不但为了中国人民，同时也为了全世界爱好和平的人民，我们就有了勇气与决心。我记得，和苏联导演——俄罗斯共和国联邦功勋艺术家瓦尔拉莫夫，以及我们的苏联同伴们最初的会晤，那时说的话，今天想起来却都是工作的誓言：“我们要告诉全世界，中国人民是怎样战胜敌人的！”“我们要告诉全世界，中国人民的和平、幸福是怎样得来的！”“我们的工作是斯大林、毛泽东所决定的，我们一定要做好。”我们工作组的同志，就是带着这样一种誓言进行工作的。
    在罗申大使代表斯大林奖金委员会授奖那天，我说过：“从这一部艺术创作——‘中国人民的胜利’——来说，我觉得这光荣应当归功于斯大林培养出来的苏联先进艺术家们。只有经过瓦尔拉莫夫、西蒙诺夫、鲁京斯基、古舍夫等同志之手，才在电影艺术领域内，给英雄的斗争取得了英雄的艺术形式，我们是在工作中时时刻刻向他们学习的。”这是我的衷心的感谢的言语。无论是在中国的实际摄制场合，无论是在莫斯科文献制片厂的工作间里，我觉得每一个苏联同志都是那样热忱，在这中间深深的含蓄着亲兄弟般的国际主义的情感。瓦尔拉莫夫，这个战争中久经考验的导演家，当我们谈到中国人民的时候，他说：“在革命以前，中国土地是广大的，农民热爱土地，但他自己所有的土地，在广大土地中所占的是那样小，他们只在那一小块土地上，以一生血汗、一粒种籽、一粒种籽培植起来，养活自己。这一方面表示农民热爱土地，一方面表示农村经济的贫困。在城市里，则充满帝国主义巨厦与贫民窟的对比。现在我们要把中国人民如何得到胜利这个事实，向全世界宣布。”从他的话里可以听出他对中国劳动人民深厚的同情与热爱。鲁京斯基，社会主义制度下培养出来的新人，由一个火车厢修理工人成为一个艺术家，他那忠诚的责任心，细密、彻底、辛勤的工作作风，是完成工作任务的重要保证。古舍夫——工作团体中的长兄，他曾经亲手拍摄过伟大的列宁本人的纪录影片，他永远如同温和的阳光，教育着他的助手，年青的中国学徒。每个看过“中国人民的胜利”的人，都觉得电影解说简直是一首歌颂英雄中国的长诗。我记得，到达莫斯科的第二天就看见了西蒙诺夫，在放映室里看最初的工作拷贝时，他坐在我身旁，随着上万尺片子的转动，他就热情奔放地讲说他的腹稿，他说这里我们应该怎样解说，那里我们应该怎样解说。总之，我觉得巨大的、崇高的国际主义精神，是我们工作胜利的重大原因。对于中国人民衷心的热爱，对于中国革命成果与世界人民斗争关系的正确理解，在我们工作中迸放出热情的火花。但仅仅靠热情还完不成工作，苏联艺术家，在工作作风方面，是以严肃的责任心与集体主义精神结合着的。一切为了把工作做好，这就是最高的原则，为了这，可以商讨，甚至可以争辩，只有经过争辩，找到真理，促进了工作的时候，大家才都感到真正的愉快。这是优良的批评与自我批评作风在实际工作中具体的体现，因为这样在我们工作中，就不允许那种腐朽的资产阶级艺术家个人主义的，不能批评，不能讨论的残余思想存在，我们的目标就非常明确。因为我们的工作将是一个整体的工作，将是保卫世界和平斗争战线上一种斗争，一次胜利，艺术家的责任就是为这种斗争与胜利而服务。
    从艺术创作方面来说，在八千尺胶片中，要表现
    一部中国人民英勇斗争的史实，这是一桩不容易的事。这第一需要极大的艺术概括能力，第二需要高度艺术表现的技巧。我们在这方面也为自己规定了概括历史的任务。一次和瓦尔拉莫夫在旅行当中，研究我们的工作，我们说到：“战争为了未来的幸福。血不是白流的。我们这部片子，一方面是作家要说的话，一方面是英雄要说的话，最后是和平、胜利，——一切为了胜利。”这不但是一个历史过程，也是我们的创作的指导思想。既然是艺术的概括，我们马上就又接触到一个如何形象的表现中国英雄斗争的问题。在艺术方面，伟大的社会主义现实主义要求着我们去掌握、去表现、去讴歌中国人民英雄的本质，表示出未来的光明，我们要做一部充满英雄光彩的作品出来。要达到这个目的，我们真正创作的开端，是向中国人民解放军的实际斗争学习。
    这种学习，是在党与军队领导机关指导下进行的。首先，我们的创作提纲，就只有在领导机关直接组织、协助、审查之后作了一次再次的详细修改，然后才确定了的。同时从大的战场轮廓到每个具体战役、战斗，我们都听了报告，作了记录，另外还搜集了相当丰富的书面资料。在这时期中，我们差不多接触了全部解放战争各个主要方面的资料与事实。我们在实际拍制某一部分战争影片时，也都是首先得到这一战役的指挥员亲身协助，直接指导组织，而后向干部、战士或军事记者进行访问，再来制作这一部分的详细计划出来，工作计划是我们学习的结果，然后又以它来指导我们的实际工作，最后这详细计划才化为一个一个的镜头。在实际工作阶段，我应当谈到两方面感人的事实：一方面是我们部队的指挥员和战斗员，他们不但给我们电影工作队以热情的欢迎，更重要的是以他们无比的勇敢与智慧、崇高的自我牺牲的精神，充实了影片的内容，我们所得的荣誉应当属予他们，因为他们是“中国人民的胜利”的真正制造者与主演者，没有他们，是不能制造出这部影片的。另一方面是苏联的导演与摄影师们，在制作场合上他们的战斗热情与部队的战斗热情是溶和为一片的，只要有工作做，常常一天不吃饭，一直工作到天黑才回来，在这种时刻，谁要让他们休息，他们会不高兴，会说：“我们是来工作，不是来休息的。”我发现苏维埃艺术家感人之处，他们的愉快与幸福是在忘我的工作和对人民有益的劳动中，创作是劳动的结果。
    伟大的祖国，伟大祖国英勇的斗争，要求我们考虑，在这部五彩影片中，不但充满英雄光彩，而且应当充满乐观主义的情调，我们在摄制、说明及音乐中都注意如何实现这一企图，结果“中国人民的胜利”实际表现了中国人民这种排山倒海的英雄气概。我觉得苏联摄影师在这方面有极宝贵的贡献，他们给“中国人民的胜利”创造了很多庄严美丽的画面与可爱的英雄的形象，甚至一个普通战士的面型，也是令人那样爱慕而永远难忘。所以如此，是因为摄影师艺术地精选了镜头，他不仅仅取得形象的表面，更重要的是他善于选择那能以体现我们英雄本质、英雄光彩的动人的形象实质。
    这部影片最主要的剪辑与录音工作，是在莫斯科进行的。“北京——莫斯科”这响亮的一句话，对我们的工作有特别意义，我们的工作开始于北京，而完成于莫斯科，这不是很有纪念意义吗？这最后一段工作，经过反复的审查，分析和修改。瓦尔拉莫夫、鲁京斯基和我们，曾经把全部片子分为十几部分，一部分一部分仔细审查，提出意见，那时我们在放映室里有时要一口气工作十二小时，然后再把几十种大小不同的建议汇集起来加以研究，讨论，以至去修改影片。西蒙诺夫的电影解说词，也是经过电影厂、电影部一次再次审查，一次再次修改，才算定稿。现在回想起来，只有这种严肃的、科学的工作态度，才逐渐制成这部巨大历史性的影片。第一次在莫斯科文献制片厂大放映间试映完成片时，当中国人民斗争生活活现在银幕之上，我记得，那时我的心情十分激动，但我们并没自己马上歌唱自己的工作，因为一部艺术品的成功还是失败，是要决定于千百万普通观众的。但从这次创作工作中，苏联电影艺术家的工作方法却给了我很大的启发。把丰富的现实斗争生活变为艺术创造，这是十分科学而细密的工作，只有当你经过概括，掌握了生活的本质，然后通过艺术形象的表现，完成你的结构，这时多种多样的现实生活才组织起来，才生动起来，才突出了，才有了光彩。而这一切一切的关键，在于学习，学习是我们真正创造的开端，学习保证我们工作前进，电影创作特别让我感到兴趣的是：这里从来不会是个人的创造，每个个人的创造永远属于那创作的总体。电影创作要求每一个参加者有明确的统一的创作思想，严肃的责任心与集体主义的精神。想到这些经验，我觉得中国艺术家在将要进行的重大创作工作中，我们是十分需要创作上的集体主义精神的。
    我是去年八月初，携带第一部拷贝从莫斯科飞回北京的，现在恰好整整一年。“中国人民的胜利”给予帝国主义者一个严重的打击，因为这部影片在各国各地银幕上出现，就是向世界宣告：中国人民是不可战胜的，我们和伟大苏联，以及爱好和平的各国人民团结起来，就将成为保卫和平的强大力量，就将粉碎美帝国主义者的侵略战争。由于这种在争取世界和平的事业上的贡献，因而获得全世界人民的热烈爱好与欢迎。我觉得这不是偶然的，这是它表现了中国人民所创造的光辉灿烂的革命史实的结果，这是伟大的斯大林大元帅与伟大的毛泽东主席对于这一项工程领导与关怀的结果，这是中国人民解放军参加与协助的结果，这是苏联和中国艺术家共同努力的结果。我自己作为制作“中国人民的胜利”工作者之一员，而获得斯大林文学艺术奖金的荣誉，我感到十分的荣幸，但我知道这收获是中国人民的收获，是中国艺术界的收获，是中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊的收获。至于我个人在文学艺术方面所做的工作还只是一个开端。现在，新中国在我们面前展开伟大而丰富的现实生活远景，我们应当坚决地贯彻毛主席的文艺路线，为了表现伟大的爱国主义与保卫世界和平的主题而努力奋斗。（附图片）
