China's textile industry has experienced three stages in the past two years: maintenance, recovery, and development. At present, the cotton textile industry, the flax textile industry, and the knitwear industry are all developing. The silk industry is also being vigorously restored. By the end of last year, the national output of yarn and cloth had already exceeded the highest historical record of China's cotton textile industry. In 1951, the textile industry experienced even greater development. Compared with the same period last year, the production volume from January to June of this year shows an increase of 29.95% in cotton yarn, 24.5% in cotton cloth, 154.66% in burlap sacks, and 137.71% in the completion of blanket production plans.

The increase in production is closely related to the significant growth in labor productivity over the past two years. Through multiple patriotic production campaigns, workers' enthusiasm for production has increased each time, and output has also increased accordingly. Now, regardless of the region or factory, the unit output of spindles and looms has exceeded the past by 20% to 45%. The Northwest textile industry, which was once considered "backward," has now reached a spindle output of 1.02 to 1.05 pounds per 20-hour period for 20-count yarn, more than doubling the average pre-liberation output.

Currently, the supply of raw cotton in our country is not yet sufficient. Therefore, saving raw cotton is closely related to completing yarn and cloth production plans and increasing output. Since the beginning of this year, the mass movement to save cotton led by the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union has achieved great results in various cotton mills. According to typical experiments on reducing cotton waste and utilizing short-staple cotton in fourteen cotton mills, the amount of cotton used per piece of 20-count yarn has broken the quota of 414.69 catties stipulated by the National Textile Conference, generally not exceeding 410 catties. If short-staple cotton is mixed into the main yarn for reuse, it can be less than 400 catties, while the quality of the cloth still meets the standards. It is estimated that throughout this year, the nation can save 160,000 dan of raw cotton by reusing short-staple cotton. Hao Jianxiu's method of reducing licker-in waste at the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory has provided an extremely important method for saving raw cotton. According to seven months of statistics, Hao Jianxiu's average licker-in waste is only 0.25%, while before the promotion of Hao Jianxiu's method, the average of eight factories in Qingdao was about 1.66%. If the national licker-in waste rate could be the same as Hao Jianxiu's, the country could increase yarn production by tens of thousands of pieces within a year. In the past, the Southwest region needed more than 470 catties of cotton to spin one piece of 20-count yarn, but now it has dropped to about 410 catties. Qingdao has even lowered it to 400 catties.

In order to further increase the production of yarn and cloth, national cotton textile factories simultaneously carried out machine leveling and learning in June and July of this year. For decades, the machines in national public and private factories had never been seriously overhauled; some had never been overhauled at all. This thorough overhaul will play a significant role in improving production efficiency in the future. At the same time, democratic reforms or political studies were carried out in various regions, with approximately 250,000 textile workers participating in these democratic reforms and political studies. In particular, after the democratic reforms, the foreman system was overthrown, the unity of employees was strengthened, and new systems were established. Without exception, a large number of activists emerged in various factories, and the factories took on a new look. This is the most important step in transforming old enterprises into new ones, laying the foundation for large-scale production in the future.

In order to meet the needs of the people across the country whose lives are improving day by day, the state has invested a large amount of capital this year to build new textile factories. Such a large-scale factory construction project as this year's is a first in the history of China's textile industry. According to the report at the end of August, all newly built units can complete their scheduled tasks ahead of schedule before the end of this year.

In order to supply the machinery and equipment for the new factories, the first complete set of textile machinery began to be manufactured domestically in the first half of 1951. This is also an unprecedented event in the history of China's textile industry. Moreover, this year's output will be sufficient to supply half of the machinery and equipment for the newly built units this year. It can be completely replenished by the first quarter of next year.

### 我国纺织工业正在恢复发展  纱布产量远远超过历史上的最高纪录  今年上半年已开始自造全套纺织机械

    我国纺织工业正在恢复发展
    纱布产量远远超过历史上的最高纪录
    今年上半年已开始自造全套纺织机械
    新中国的纺织工业，两年来经历了维持、恢复和发展的三个阶段。目前，棉纺织工业、麻纺织工业、针织工业都在发展中。丝绸工业也在大力恢复。去年年底，全国纱、布产量就已超过中国棉纺织业历史的最高纪录。一九五一年，纺织工业又有了更大的发展。以今年一至六月的生产量与去年同期比较，棉纱增产了百分之二十九点九五，棉布增产了百分之二十四点五，麻袋增产了百分之一百五十四点六六，毛毯完成了生产计划的百分之一百三十七点七一。
    产量的提高与两年来劳动生产率的显著增长有密切关系。经过多次的爱国主义生产竞赛，工人的生产积极性一次比一次提高，产量也随着增加。现在不论任何地区任何工厂，纱锭和布机的单位产量，都已超过过去百分之二十至百分之四十五。一向被认为“落后”的西北纺织工业，以二十支纱二十小时计算，锭产量也已达到了一点○二磅至一点○五磅，超过解放前平均产量一倍。
    目前我国原棉供应尚不充足，因此节约原棉对于完成纱、布生产计划提高产量有密切关系。今年以来，中央人民政府纺织工业部和纺织工会全国委员会领导各纱厂开展的群众性的节约用棉运动，已有很大成绩。根据十四个纱厂关于减少落棉和利用抄斩花的典型试验，每件二十支纱用棉量已打破了全国纺织会议所规定的四百一十四点六九斤的定额，一般不超过四百一十斤。如将抄斩花掺入本支回用，可不超过四百斤，而布的质量仍然合于标准。据估计，在今年中，因回用抄斩花，全国可以节省原棉十六万担。国营青岛第六棉纺织厂郝建秀少出皮辊花的工作法，更给节约原棉提供了极重要的方法。根据七个月的统计，郝建秀平均只出皮辊花百分之零点二五，而在推广郝建秀工作法以前，青岛八个厂平均约为百分之一点六六。如果全国皮辊花率都能和郝建秀的一样，一年内就可以为国家增产几万件纱。过去西南地区纺一件二十支纱，需棉花四百七十余斤，现在已降至四百十斤左右。青岛方面更降低到四百斤。
    为了进一步提高纱、布生产，今年六七月间全国棉纺织工厂同时进行了平车和学习。全国公私营厂的机器几十年来未曾认真检修过，有的甚至从未检修过。这次进行彻底检修，对今后生产效率的提高将起很大的作用。各地同时进行了民主改革或政治学习，参加这次民主改革与政治学习的纺织工人约计二十五万人。特别是经过民主改革，推倒了把头制，加强了职工团结，建立了新制度，各厂无例外地涌现了大批积极分子，工厂面貌一新。这是改造旧企业为新企业的最重要的一步，为今后的大生产奠定了基础。
    为了满足全国人民生活日趋改善的需要，国家已在今年内投入大量资金，建设新的纺织工厂。像今年这样大规模的建厂工程，在中国纺织史上还是初次。根据八月底报告，在今年底以前各新建单位都能提前完成预定任务。
    为了供应新建厂的机器设备，一九五一年上半年国内已开始第一次自造全套纺织机械。这也是中国纺织史上空前未有的大事。而且今年的出品，就足以供应本年度新建单位机械设备的半数。到明年第一季内就可以完全补足。（新华社）
