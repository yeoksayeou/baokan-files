The Shandong branch of the Central People's Government Northern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group, along with parts of the Anhui North and Jiangsu North branches, went to the Yimeng Mountain area in Shandong on August 3 to express their regards to the people of the Yimeng Mountain area who made great contributions during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation.

Just stepping into the edge of the Yimeng Mountain area, on both banks of the Yi River, the endless "green gauze tents" are full of fat sorghum. Patches of golden grain ears and lush green soybean seedlings flutter in the breeze. Not a single barren piece of land can be found on the slopes, herds of cattle and sheep graze at the foot of the mountains, and lush mountain forests and newly built mountain ditches and dams... These are the results of the patriotic production increase movement carried out by the people of the Yimeng Mountain area for more than two years. With their diligence and courage, they quickly healed the serious wounds inflicted on them by the war. Last year, the harvest in four counties including Yishui exceeded the pre-war level, and the general areas were also close to the pre-war level. This year's wheat harvest is unprecedented in more than a decade, and this autumn will be the second year of good harvest.

The people here are heroic and tenacious. In the mountains where thousands of troops once fought, the farmers will proudly tell you: "The iron hooves of the Japanese devils trampled every mountain top of Yishan and Mengshan, and frantically implemented 'iron wall encirclement', 'three alls policy', 'blockade and suppression'... but they were finally crushed and defeated by us." Several farmers in Tangzizhuang in front of Menglianggu Mountain pointed to the dangerous mountain peak and said: "This is where the ace of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, the 74th Division, equipped by American imperialism, was sent to its death. We all participated in the battle then!" Yes, they should be proud. For the sake of the motherland and the victory of the revolution, more than 93,000 young people from Yishui Prefecture alone joined the People's Liberation Army, and more than 10,000 sacrificed their lives in the flames of war. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army launched a key offensive against Shandong, men and women, old and young, in Shandong Province fully supported the war. In the Laiwu Campaign, which annihilated seven divisions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Li Xianzhou's troops, as many as 500,000 people in the then Luzhong area (the Yimeng Mountain area is a part of the Luzhong area) served on the battlefield. Their heroic fighting was not only to liberate their hometown, but after the liberation of their hometown, they actively participated in the Huaihai Campaign, the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign to liberate southern China and other battles. In these battles, Yishui Prefecture alone organized 200,000 regular civilian laborers to serve on the front lines. Millions of women in the entire region bravely undertook rear service and land cultivation.

The visiting group extended cordial greetings to the heroic people of the Yimeng Mountain area and presented them with four silk banners inscribed with the words "Maintain the glory of the revolution, we will always be grateful to you." The farmers spread the word everywhere: "Chairman Mao sent people to see us!" The elderly family members of martyrs and military personnel told everyone they met: "Chairman Mao has not forgotten us for a moment!"

The visiting group first convened meetings with family members of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled revolutionary soldiers in each place to express their condolences.

Here, preferential treatment work has become a mass movement. The farmers would all say: "The soldiers are the defenders of the motherland, and our substitute cultivation is precisely to enable the soldiers to better defend our own happy life!" When governments at all levels and the Communist Party committees at all levels are deploying work, and when people's organizations are formulating patriotic pacts, they all regard substitute cultivation work as one of the important contents. This year, preferential treatment committees have been generally established in counties, districts, townships, and villages. Currently, 60% to 70% of the villages in Yishui Prefecture have implemented fixed substitute cultivation, and 93% of the villages in Yinan County have implemented fixed substitute cultivation. Family members of martyrs and military personnel generally reflected: "Our lives have been improved after the fixed substitute cultivation." Li Guidong, a family member of a military personnel who had no land in the past, has built a new home in the past two years. Last year, he had surplus grain, bought a small house, sixteen pieces of bean cake, built three new houses, and raised two pigs. The whole family ate seven or eight meals of buns during the Spring Festival. This year, he bought more than 100 feet of cloth and prepared to make a set of single and cotton clothes for each of his five family members. The diligent model family members of martyrs and military personnel were elected by the masses as people's representatives. In Antiqu District of Yinan County, more than 60 family members of martyrs and military personnel were elected as representatives to the district people's congress. Liu Butang, an old man from the family of a military personnel in the district, was honorably elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the county people's congress. They said: "This is the glory given to us by the people, the glory given to us by Chairman Mao."

The people of the Yimeng Mountain area wrote letters to Chairman Mao one after another, and instructed the comrades of the visiting group to say: "Please give our regards to Chairman Mao and tell him that we love our motherland!" Father Tian, a family member of a military personnel, said: "We cannot go to Beijing, please tell Chairman Mao that the lives of the families of military personnel are improving day by day, please rest assured."

In order to prevent imperialism from destroying our beautiful lives again, and to oppose American imperialism's unilateral peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, on May Day, 1.33 million farmers in the entire region held grand demonstrations, and more than 1.95 million people signed the declaration supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers. Zhu Fusheng, the county magistrate of Yishui County and a labor hero who became rich through diligence, told us: Patriotic covenants and production increase donation plans have been formulated in organized groups of people and mutual aid groups. The farmers in Shijingzhuang in the county applied 7,000 pieces of bean cake to their land this year, an increase of more than 4,000 pieces compared to last year. They decided to donate 2.2 million yuan from the increased production to purchase airplanes and cannons. Zu Baochuan, a model military family member in Yinan who is over fifty years old, firmly refused to have someone cultivate his land for him. He said: "I can still work. In order to avoid suffering a second time, I have already asked my son to join the army, and I myself must take the lead in production." He has already memorized his seven production increase donation plans. He plans to harvest 525 more catties of coarse grains than last year and donate 50,000 yuan. He said: "Donating a 'Farmer's Airplane' is the responsibility of every patriotic farmer."

These are the gifts from the people of the Yimeng Mountain area to repay Chairman Mao.

    英勇的沂蒙山区人民
    新华社记者  包慧
    中央人民政府北方老根据地访问团山东分团，皖北、苏北分团各一部，于八月三日赴山东沂蒙山区，去慰问在抗日战争和解放战争中有巨大贡献的沂蒙山区人民。
    刚踏进沂蒙山区的边缘，在沂河两岸，一望无边的“青纱帐”，长满了肥大的高粱。一片片金黄谷穗、绿油油的豆苗，在微风里飘漾。坡里找不到一分荒芜的土地，山坡下放着成群的牛羊，茂盛的山林和新修筑的山沟、水坝……这些都是沂蒙山区人民两年多来，开展爱国丰产运动的结果。他们以自己的勤劳和勇敢，迅速地医治了战争所加给他们的严重创伤。去年，沂水等四个县的收获量已经超过了战前的水平，一般地区亦均接近战前。今年的麦子是十余年来所未有的收成，今秋又将是第二个丰收的年景。
    这里的人民是英勇顽强的。在当年千军万马转战过的山丛里，农民们会自豪地告诉你：“日本鬼子的铁蹄，踏遍了沂山蒙山的每个山顶，疯狂地对我们施行了‘铁壁合围’、‘三光政策’、‘封锁扫荡’……，但终于被我们粉碎和打垮了。”在孟良崮山前塘子庄的几个农民，指着那险要的山峰说：“这就是美帝国主义装备起来的蒋匪军的王牌——七十四师送死的地方，那时我们都参战了呀！”是的，他们是应该骄傲的。为了祖国、为了革命的胜利，仅沂水专区就有九万三千多青年参加了解放军，一万余人在战火中牺牲了自己的生命。在蒋匪军向山东举行重点进攻时，山东省男女老少全力支援战争。在歼灭蒋匪李仙洲部七个师的莱芜战役中，仅当时的鲁中地区（沂蒙山区是鲁中区的一部），就有五十万人民在战地服务。他们这样英勇战斗，不只是为了解放自己的家乡，家乡解放后，他们并积极参加了淮海、渡江解放江南等战役。在这些战役中，仅沂水专区就组织了二十万随军常备民工赴前线服务。全区百万妇女则勇敢地担任了后方勤务和土地的耕种。
    访问团向英勇的沂蒙山区人民进行了亲切的慰问，并赠给他们写着“保持革命的光荣，我们永远感激着你们”等字样的锦旗四面。农民们到处传告：“毛主席派人来看咱了！”年老的烈属、军属逢人就说：“毛主席一时一刻没有忘了咱呀！”
    访问团每到一地，都是首先召开烈属、军属及革命残废军人会议进行慰问。
    在这里，优抚工作已成为群众性的运动。农民们都会说：“战士是祖国的保卫者，我们代耕正是为了使战士更好地保卫我们自己的幸福生活！”各级人民政府和中共各级委员会在布置工作时，各人民团体在订立爱国公约时，都把代耕工作作为重要内容之一。今年各县、区、乡、村已普遍建立了优抚委员会。现沂水专区已有百分之六十至七十的村庄推行了固定代耕，沂南县已有百分之九十三的村庄推行了固定代耕。烈属、军属普遍反映：“固定代耕后咱的生活得到改善了。”过去一点地没有的军属李桂东，两年来建设了新的家务。去年他有了余粮，买了一座小房子，十六块豆饼，还盖了三间新屋，喂了两口猪，过年全家吃了七八顿包子。今年他买了一百多尺布，准备给全家五口每人做一套单衣和棉衣。勤劳模范的烈属、军属们，更被群众选出当了人民代表，沂南县岸堤区就有六十余烈属、军属当选为区人民代表会议的代表。该区军属刘步堂老大爷，光荣地当选为县人民代表会议的常务委员。他们说：“这是人民给咱的光荣，毛主席给咱的光荣。”
    沂蒙山区的人民纷纷给毛主席写信，并嘱咐访问团的同志说：“替我们给毛主席捎个好，告诉他我们是热爱着我们的祖国！”军属田大爷说：“我们不能去北京，请你们告诉毛主席，军属的生活一天天地改善了，请他放心。”
    该区人民为了不再让帝国主义来破坏美好的生活，为了反对美帝国主义片面对日媾和和重新武装日本，“五一”劳动节时，全区有一百三十三万农民，举行了盛大的示威游行，一百九十五万余人在拥护五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签了名。沂水县县长、勤劳发家的劳动英雄朱富胜告诉我们：该县在有组织的群众和变工组内均订立了爱国公约和增产捐献计划。该县石井庄的农民，今年在自己的地里上了七千片豆饼，比去年增加了四千多片。他们决定从增产中捐献二百二十万元购买飞机大炮。沂南五十余岁的模范军属祖保传，坚决不要人代耕，他说：“我还能干活，为了不受二楂罪，我已经叫儿子去参军，我自己也要在生产上带头干。”他已经背熟了自己的七条增产捐献计划。他计划今年要比去年多收五百二十五斤粗粮，捐献五万元。他说：“捐献‘农民号飞机’，是每一个爱国农民的责任。”
    这些就是沂蒙山区人民报答毛主席的礼物。
