Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Paris News: With the assistance of the French ruling clique, American war merchants are intensifying their occupation of France, turning it into an aggressive military base. This aggressive behavior by the United States is being met with increasingly resolute opposition from the French people.

According to reports from the French Communist Party's "l'Humanité," "New France Weekly," and other democratic newspapers: By July of this year, the United States had established bases and other military facilities or stationed troops in 57 of France's 90 departments. The United States has occupied six French naval bases; seized or is seizing 25 airports and air force bases; and has established or is establishing 18 warehouses to store various military equipment and fuel. In addition, smaller American bases are scattered throughout France. A large number of American troops are stationed in all these bases, warehouses, and other military facilities.

The American military occupation of France began in November of last year. At that time, the then-ruling Pleven government openly signed an agreement with the American government to hand over two French seaports on the Atlantic coast—Bordeaux and La Pallice—to the Americans for management, making them supply bases for American troops stationed in Germany and Austria, and allowing the Americans to build military highways from Bordeaux through southeastern Paris to the German border near Strasbourg. Since then, the American occupation of France has become more and more blatant. They have established atomic bomber bases and air force bases in Paris, Tours, and many other places; they are actively building submarine bases in France; their fleets arbitrarily anchor in French ports on the Mediterranean coast; they establish various military warehouses and lay oil pipelines; they arbitrarily seize large amounts of land and civilian housing.

The American occupation of France has aroused great anger among the French people. Now, people in various parts of France have established "Committees for the Protection of the Rights of the French People" and "Committees for the Defense of Requisitioned Property" to resolutely fight against the American military occupation of France. In Bordeaux, Marseille, and other seaports, dockworkers refuse to handle war materials for the Americans. The people on the Île d'Oléron resolutely protested against the Americans building an airport on the island. In La Rochelle, Lannemezan in the Hautes-Pyrénées, Saint-Jean-de-Luz in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, and many other places, people signed and issued statements protesting against the American occupation. The French pilots who originally served at the airport near Châteauroux held a protest demonstration when they were forced to leave and hand over the airport to the Americans. They shouted slogans: "Americans go home!" "Although we are leaving now, we will come back!" The French people's protest movement has achieved some victories. For example, in Brest, one of France's best ports on the Atlantic coast, the American occupiers dared not touch it because of the dockworkers' firm opposition. In Elvige in Alsace, the American occupiers were also forced to abandon their plan to build an airport.

    法国人民反对军事基地化
    抗议美国占领法国
    码头工人拒运美国战争物资
   【新华社三十一日讯】巴黎消息：在法国统治集团协助之下，美国战争贩子正在加紧占领法国，变法国为其侵略军事基地。美国这种侵略行为正受到法国人民有增无已的坚决反对。
    据法国共产党的“人道报”、“新法兰西周刊”及其他民主报刊报道：到今年七月，在法国本土九十省中，美国已在五十七省设有基地及其他军事设施，或驻有军队。美国已占用了法国六个海军基地；已霸占或正在霸占二十五个机场和空军基地；已建立或正在建立十八个仓库，储存各种军事装备和燃料。此外，较小的美国基地更是遍布法国各地。在所有这些基地、仓库及其他军事设施的所在地都驻有大批美军。
    美国军队占领法国，是在去年十一月间开始的。那时当政的普利文政府公然与美国政府签订协定，把大西洋岸的两个法国海港——波尔多和拉巴利斯交给美国人管理，使之成为驻德、奥美军的供应基地，并准许美国人修筑军用公路，从波尔多经巴黎东南到斯特拉斯堡附近的德国边境。在此以后，美国人对法国的占领就一天比一天明目张胆地进行。他们在巴黎、都尔及其他许多地方建立原子弹轰炸机基地和空军基地，他们在法国积极建立潜艇基地，他们的舰队又在地中海岸的法国港口任意碇泊；他们建立各种军用仓库，并敷设油管；他们随意强占大量土地与民房。
    美国占领法国的行动引起了法国人民的极大愤怒。现在，法国各地人民已经成立“法国人民权利保障委员会”和“保卫被征用财产委员会”，坚决进行斗争，反对美国军队占领法国。在波尔多、马赛及其他海港，码头工人拒绝为美国人搬运战争物资。鄂列隆岛上的人民坚决抗议美国人在该岛建筑机场。罗舍尔港、上比利牛斯省的朗门让城、海滨省的圣让，当日利及其他许多地方，人们签名发表声明，抗议美国占领。原来在沙托卢附近的机场服务的法国飞行员，在被迫离去而把机场交给美国人时曾举行抗议性的示威。他们高呼口号：“美国人滚回去！”“我们现在虽然离开，但是我们还要回来！”法国人民的抗议运动已获得若干胜利。例如在大西洋岸法国最好的港口之一布勒斯特，因为码头工人的坚决反对，美国占领者就不敢对之问津。在阿尔萨斯的艾尔维埃，美国占领者也曾被迫放弃了他们建设机场的计划。
