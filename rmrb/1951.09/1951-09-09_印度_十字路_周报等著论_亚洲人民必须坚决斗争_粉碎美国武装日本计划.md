Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Delhi, 6th (TASS): In India, protests against the US-made draft of the Japanese peace treaty are increasing. The "Crossroads" weekly said: "The rearming of Japan, making Japan an American gendarme to suppress the Asian people struggling against imperialism and feudalism, the Japanese industrial potential controlled by the United States endangering the economic progress of Asian countries—all this makes it necessary to wage the most relentless and resolute struggle to prevent the imperialists from realizing their plans in Japan." The newspaper pointed out: "The Soviet Union and People's China demand the conclusion of a genuine peace treaty with Japan, which should guarantee the prosperity of the Japanese people, and should be concluded by all relevant countries on the basis of the international agreements during the Second World War." The newspaper emphasized that the task of all people is to fight for the conclusion of such a treaty.

The "Blitz" weekly expressed the Indian public's dissatisfaction with the Japanese "peace treaty" formulated by Dulles, pointing out that the refusal of 500 million Chinese people and 350 million Indian people to sign the treaty proves that Asia condemns "the US State Department's plan for Japan."

    亚洲人民必须坚决斗争  粉碎美国武装日本计划
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社德里六日讯：印度对美制对日和约草案的抗议日益增多。“十字路”周报说：“重新武装日本，使日本充当美国的宪兵以抑制为反对帝国主义和封建主义而斗争的亚洲人民，为美国所控制的日本工业潜力危及亚洲各国经济的进步——凡此种种，都使人们必须进行最无情的坚决斗争，使帝国主义者不能在日本实现其计划。”该报指出：“苏联和人民中国要求缔结真正的对日和约，这个和约要保证日本人民的繁荣，而且要由一切有关国家以第二次世界大战期间的国际协定为基础来缔结”。该报强调说：一切人民的任务就是为缔结这样一个和约而斗争。
    “闪电”周刊表示印度公众对杜勒斯制订的对日“和约”的不满，它指出：由五亿中国人民和三亿五千万的印度人民拒绝签订该和约就可以证明：亚洲谴责“美国国务院的对日计划”。
