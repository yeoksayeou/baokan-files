The Central People's Government Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Groups and their subgroups are cordially visiting revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, and the people in various old revolutionary base areas. Xie Juezai, head of the visiting group, and Zheng Shaowen and Li Buxin, deputy heads of the group, and Yan Baohang, deputy secretary-general, visited Fang Lao Tai Tai, the mother of revolutionary martyr General Fang Zhimin, in Nanchang, accompanied by Shao Shiping, chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government.

    **Central Subgroup**

The central subgroup of the visiting group is led by Xie Juezai, head of the visiting group, and Zheng Shaowen and Li Buxin, deputy heads. Xie Juezai, head of the visiting group, led four detachments to Ruijin on August 16th. They arrived in Changting County, Fujian Province, on August 20th, where they met with the five detachments led by deputy head Li Buxin. Changting was the location of the Fujian Provincial Soviet Government personally established by Chairman Mao during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. The people of western Fujian firmly believed in Chairman Mao's words, "The revolution will surely succeed." After the Red Army's Long March, they persisted in revolutionary guerrilla warfare for more than twenty years. Until the victory of the Liberation War, in the area of 150,000 agricultural population in Longyan, Shanghang, Yongding, and other counties, they still maintained the fruits of land reform from twenty years ago. When the central subgroup arrived in Changting, more than 20,000 people from Changting city and its surrounding areas gathered in the western suburbs of Changting to welcome them. When they heard Xie Juezai, head of the group, say that Chairman Mao was healthier than he was in Changting in 1929, they repeatedly cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The detachments of the central subgroup coming to western Fujian will travel from Changting to Longyan, Yongding, Shanghang, Zhangping, Wuping, Liancheng, Yong'an, Longxi, and other counties in western and southwestern Fujian for visits.

    **Min-Zhe-Gan Subgroup**

The Min-Zhe-Gan subgroup, led by subgroup head Shao Shiping, arrived in Yiyang County town from Nanchang on the morning of August 16th. Yiyang County was the center of the old revolutionary base area of Min-Zhe-Gan during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. More than a thousand revolutionary martyrs' families, revolutionary military personnel families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and people from all walks of life lined up at the station to welcome them. The people from the rural areas near the county town and many revolutionary martyrs' and military families dozens of miles away from the county town also rushed to the town that afternoon. When they saw Shao Shiping, one of the leaders of the Min-Zhe-Gan base area, they felt particularly close and told him about how the People's Government had led them to rebuild their homes destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits and restore production after liberation. Before the arrival of the visiting group, the farmers in various townships had already sent revolutionary relics such as red flags and certificates treasured from the Second Revolutionary Civil War period and local products to the county people's government, requesting that they be given to the visiting group to be sent to Chairman Mao. A joint celebration meeting of more than 3,000 people was held at 6:00 p.m. on August 16th. At the meeting, subgroup head Shao Shiping cordially conveyed Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's concern for the people in the old revolutionary base areas. The people present all expressed that they must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and strive to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." In the evening, the visiting group's film team showed a movie.

The fifth detachment of the subgroup, led by the subgroup's deputy head Long Yue, also went to Chong'an and other places in northern Fujian Province on the 16th for visits.

    **Xiang-E-Gan Subgroup**

The Xiang-E-Gan subgroup of the visiting group is going deep into the rural areas of Pingjiang County to comfort the people of the old revolutionary base areas. In the past ten days, the subgroup has convened five mass rallies, six representatives' meetings and symposiums of revolutionary martyrs' families, revolutionary military personnel families, and revolutionary workers' families, and has issued more than 10,000 letters of sympathy to the masses. The subgroup has received more than 500 letters and 100 pennants from the masses to Chairman Mao and the visiting group. Every martyr's family, military family, and worker's family who received Chairman Mao's inscription, Chairman Mao's portrait, and commemorative badges considered it an unparalleled honor. In various meetings and individual visits, the masses were most concerned about Chairman Mao's health. The masses also asked the visiting group to convey to Chairman Mao the situation of their restoration of production and construction, resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and preferential treatment work. The visiting group has submitted many opinions on the restoration of production and construction provided by the masses to the local authorities for serious study.

The three detachments of the Xiang-E-Gan subgroup in Jiangxi, led by subgroup head Deng Hong, went to Wanzai, Xiushui, Xingan, and other places for visits.

    **Xiang-Gan Subgroup**

The Xiang-Gan subgroup of the visiting group, led by visiting group deputy head Zhu Xuefan and subgroup head Tan Yubao, arrived in Chaling County town on August 10th. Chaling was one of the old revolutionary base areas personally opened up by Chairman Mao after he led the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army into the Jinggang Mountains in 1927. On this day, every household in Chaling city hung the national flag, and the people flocked to the streets with joy. The people from the old revolutionary base areas and revolutionary martyrs' families and military families from 50 to 60 miles away also specially sent representatives to the city to welcome them. Many people took the hands of the visiting group members and asked, "Is Chairman Mao well? We wish him good health forever!" At the welcome meeting, deputy head Zhu Xuefan and subgroup head Tan Yubao expressed their respect and sympathy to the people in the old revolutionary base areas who had persisted in the struggle against the enemy for a long time and suffered severely from the reactionaries. The subgroup has convened a meeting of representatives of the people from the old revolutionary base areas and martyrs' families, military families, and workers' families in Chaling, Lingxian, Youxian, Leiyang, Anren, and other counties in Chaling, and after the meeting, they went to the countryside in groups for visits.

The three detachments of the subgroup visiting the old revolutionary base areas in Jiangxi departed from Nanchang on August 15th for visits.

    **E-Yu-Wan Subgroup**

The Henan detachment of the E-Yu-Wan subgroup of the visiting group went to Xin County, Guangshan, Luoshan, Huangchuan, Gushi, Shangcheng, and other places in the E-Yu-Wan border area from Kaifeng in early August for visits. Another part of the subgroup, consisting of more than 270 people, divided into four detachments, led by subgroup deputy heads He Zhucheng, Li Yunhe, Kong Lingfu, and others, arrived in the Liu'an and Anqing areas of northern Anhui on the 14th. They will visit the old revolutionary base areas of Jinzhai, Yuexi, Qianshan, Taihu, Huoshan, Huoqiu, Liu'an, and other places in northern Anhui during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. This area was one of the old revolutionary base areas of E-Yu-Wan where the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army repeatedly crushed the attacks of the Kuomintang bandits. After the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the people of this area remained heroically unyielding and persisted in the struggle for a long time until the final victory.

    **Chuan-Shaan Border Subgroup**

The Chuan-Shaan Border subgroup arrived in Bazhong County town in northern Sichuan, the former capital of the Chuan-Shaan border area, on the afternoon of August 14th. They were warmly welcomed by the people everywhere along the way. The people of Yilong County also took out various revolutionary relics that they had preserved at the risk of their lives and asked the visiting group to present them to Chairman Mao on their behalf. At the mass rally in Bazhong city, when visiting subgroup deputy head Yu Hongyuan spoke, the masses cheered enthusiastically when they saw that Vice Chairman Yu (former Vice Chairman of the Chuan-Shaan Border Soviet), whom they had not seen for more than ten years, had returned. Deputy head Yu Hongyuan expressed his cordial sympathy and respect to the Red Army families and all the people on behalf of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao.

    **Guangdong East and Hainan Subgroups**

The Guangdong East and Hainan subgroups departed from Guangzhou in early August. The Guangdong East subgroup is headed by Gu Dacun, and the Hainan subgroup is headed by Feng Baiju. The two subgroups have a total of more than 300 members (including medical teams and cultural and art troupes), and will visit Haifeng, Lufeng, Chaoyang, Puning, Huilai, Meixian, Dabu, Fengshun, Wuhua, and other counties in eastern Guangdong and various places on Hainan Island, respectively. The Hainan subgroup arrived on Hainan Island on August 16th at the same time as the Second Subgroup of the Central Nationalities Visiting Group. The Hainan subgroup, led by deputy head Li Liming, departed on August 19th to visit Qiongshan, Wanning, Chengmai, Qiongdong, and other places. The Second Subgroup of the Central Nationalities Visiting Group, led by head Li Dequan and subgroup heads Ma Jie, Cen Jiawu, and Shi Dan, went to Baisha, Ledong, Baoting, and other counties inhabited by the Li and Miao ethnic groups, and the Hui ethnic group area of Sanya Port for visits.
