The Northwest Region will implement land reform in rural areas with a population of 14 million this winter and next spring. These areas include: 30 counties (cities) in the three special districts of Nan Zheng, Ankang, and Shangluo in southern Shaanxi Province, 65 counties (cities) in Gansu Province, 12 counties (cities) in Ningxia Province, and 6 counties (cities) in Qinghai Province. The above areas comprise a total of 5,930 townships.

The above-mentioned areas implemented rent reduction last winter and this spring, and the power of the landlord class's ruling clique has been basically crushed. The organization of peasant associations already has a considerable foundation. In addition, the peasant's political consciousness has been raised and the rural regime has been consolidated to a considerable extent through the movements of resisting America and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In order to implement land reform, since the summer of this year, the Northwest Region Land Reform Committee and the above-mentioned provinces have been actively carrying out various preparations and have trained more than 12,000 cadres. Not long ago, the Gansu Provincial Committee and the Ningxia Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened provincial party representative conferences to discuss the specific steps and methods for carrying out land reform this winter and next spring. Some typical townships in Shaanxi Province and Qinghai Province have already been experimenting with land reform.

Land reform in the above-mentioned provinces this winter is expected to begin successively in October. After this batch of villages implements land reform, together with the original Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia old area and the areas where land reform has already been carried out last winter and this spring, over 80 percent of the total population in the Northwest region, that is, the entire province of Shaanxi, the entire agricultural areas of Gansu and Ningxia, and 80 percent of the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province, will have completed the task of abolishing feudal land ownership.

The rent reduction movement in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces has been widely launched in areas where land reform has not yet been implemented before the summer harvest (rice harvest) in July, and has already achieved great results. In August, the summer harvest in the two provinces has ended, and the rent reduction movement has continued in areas that have not yet ended or have not yet started.

Except for Xingning and other counties and the suburbs of Guangzhou in Guangdong, and Guilin Special District and Guixian County, Rongxian County etc. in Guangxi which had already implemented land reform last winter and this spring, the vast majority of other areas are preparing to implement land reform this winter and next spring. The rent reduction this summer is to prepare for land reform. Before the summer harvest, the rent reduction movement in Guangdong Province had spread to 63 counties with a rural population of 15 million, and the peasants had legally reduced rent and obtained 437 million catties of grain. In Guangxi Province, by the end of July, 6 million people in rural areas had completed rent reduction, and peasants had obtained approximately 200 million catties of grain. In all villages that have completed rent reduction, 70 percent of the peasants have received some gains from the victory of rent reduction, which has greatly helped the peasants get through the lean months before this year's summer harvest.

This year, due to the victory in suppressing bandits and the increasing consolidation of the revolutionary order in rural areas, the scale of the rent reduction movement in the two provinces has greatly exceeded last year. In the rent reduction movement, various places have also combined the work of eliminating remnants of bandits and exposing special agents. Therefore, the rural areas of the two provinces have become more consolidated. The peasant forces in the two provinces have also developed greatly. The membership of the Guangdong Provincial Farmers' Association has reached 2.49 million, and in Guangxi Province, in all villages where rent reduction has been completed, the membership of the Farmers' Association accounts for 25 to 30 percent of the rural population. A large number of new peasant cadres have emerged in the movement. In order to support the peasants' rent reduction, most cities have established urban-rural liaison committees. As for the feudal forces, they have been greatly weakened in the rent reduction. In the rent reduction movement, local people's courts have legally sanctioned illegal landlords who resisted or sabotaged rent reduction and punished evil bullies and bandit leaders with great crimes reported by the peasants. All these have laid a solid foundation for the land reform movement after the autumn harvest.

    西北将有千四百万人口地区实行土地改革
    广东广西两千多万人口的农村开展了减租运动
    西北区今冬明春又将有一千四百万人口的农村实行土地改革。这些地区包括：陕西省南部南郑、安康、商雒三专区的三十个县（市），甘肃省的六十五个县（市），宁夏省的十二个县（市），和青海省的六个县（市）。以上地区共计五千九百三十个乡。
    上述地区去冬今春都实行过减租，地主阶级当权派的威风基本上已被打垮，农民协会的组织已有相当的基础。加以经过抗美援朝和镇压反革命的运动，农民政治觉悟提高，农村政权也已相当巩固。为实行土地改革，今年入夏以来，西北区土地改革委员会和上述各省即积极进行各项准备工作，训练了一万二千多干部。不久以前，中共甘肃省委和宁夏省委，都召开了一次全省的党代表会议，讨论今冬明春进行土地改革的具体步骤和办法。陕西省和青海省已有一些典型乡在试办土地改革了。
    上述各省今冬的土地改革，预计十月份即将先后开始。这批乡村实行土地改革后，连同原陕甘宁老区及去冬今春已进行了土地改革的地区，西北全区将有占总人口百分之八十以上的地区，即陕西全省，甘肃、宁夏全部农业地区和青海省百分之八十的农业地区，完成废除封建土地所有制的任务。

    广东、广西两省的减租运动，在七月夏收（收稻）以前已在尚未实行土地改革的地区广泛展开，并已有很大的成绩。八月，两省夏收已全部结束，减租运动又已在尚未结束的或尚未进行的地区继续进行。
    广东除兴宁等县和广州市郊，广西除桂林专区和贵县、容县等县在去冬今春已实行了土地改革以外，其余广大地区都准备在今冬明春实行土地改革。今夏的减租，就是为土地改革作准备。夏收以前，减租运动在广东省已扩及六十三县一千五百万人口的农村，农民依法减租获得的谷子已达四亿三千七百万斤。广西省在七月底前，也已有六百万人口的农村完成了减租，农民获得谷子约二亿斤。凡已完成了减租的乡村，百分之七十的农民都或多或少分得了一些减租的胜利果实，这对农民度过今年夏收前青黄不接的日子有很大的帮助。
    今年，因为剿匪胜利，农村革命秩序日益巩固，两省减租运动的规模大大地超过了去年。减租运动中，各地又结合进行了肃清残匪和检举特务的工作，所以，两省农村更加巩固了。两省的农民力量也已大大地发展。广东省农民协会的会员已达二百四十九万人，广西省凡已完成减租的乡村，农民协会会员都占农村人口的百分之二十五到百分之三十。运动中并已涌现大批新的农民干部。各地城市人民为支持农民减租，大多成立了城乡联络委员会。至于封建势力，在减租中有很大的削弱。各地人民法庭在减租运动中依法制裁了抵抗或破坏减租的不法地主，惩办了农民检举的罪恶很大的恶霸分子和匪首。这些，都为秋后的土地改革运动奠定了坚实的基础。（新华社）
