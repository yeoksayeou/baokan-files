Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Following the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in Washington, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting was held in Ottawa from September 15th to 20th. The foreign ministers and finance or economic ministers of the twelve member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization attended the meeting. This was an important meeting for the North Atlantic Aggression Group in advancing its war plans.

    The United States' purpose at this meeting was to coerce its vassal states into accepting the resolutions of the Washington meeting, to further expand the scale of war preparations in Europe. The meeting resulted in the adoption of the decision of the US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting on large-scale arming of West Germany, that is, concluding a so-called "peace agreement" with West Germany and organizing a "European Army" plan with West German troops as the backbone. The meeting also agreed to allow Greece and Turkey to join the North Atlantic Treaty, expanding this aggression group to the Middle East. The meeting also expressed support for the US, Britain, and France's plot to unilaterally revise the treaty with Italy, preparing to abolish the clause in the treaty stipulating that the Italian army should not exceed 250,000 men, and allowing Italy to "equally" provide cannon fodder.

    This meeting thus exposed to the world the determination of the North Atlantic Group, under the command of the United States, to further promote its war policy, but it also exposed the serious difficulties encountered by this aggression group in promoting its war policy, and the intensification of its internal contradictions.

    The difficulties faced by the North Atlantic Group are, first of all, the economic crisis caused by the expansion of armaments and war preparations, which is extremely serious and cannot be resolved. Even the communiqué of the Ottawa meeting helplessly admitted: "The reports of the Defense Production Board and the Financial and Economic Board, and the discussions on these reports at the meeting, showed that there were some difficulties in ensuring the continued progress of ... (arms expansion and war preparations). The Council noted the danger of inflation, the burden on balancing payments due to the increase in defense (should read: war preparation) efforts, and the obstacles to defense reinforcement caused by the pressure on the supply of raw materials in terms of price and allocation."

    This serious economic crisis has become a fatal weakness of the United States' war plan, and it is the root of the constantly developing contradictions within the North Atlantic Group. At the Ottawa meeting, the United States rudely coerced its vassal states to accelerate arms expansion and war preparations. US Secretary of State Acheson clearly declared in a radio address during the meeting: The vassal states must "build up military strength to the best of their ability." At the same time, General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Aggression Forces, specifically demanded at the meeting that Western European countries provide nearly one hundred divisions of troops readily available, with a total force of 1.2 million. But the answer the United States received was a rejection. Originally, the finance or economic ministers of various countries attended the Council exceptionally to complain to the United States, and they unanimously stated that they could not accept the United States' orders. According to the United Press, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gaitskell said at the meeting: "Britain is willing to fulfill its current obligations for rearmament, but under the current circumstances, it is impossible to accelerate or expand the arms expansion plan... The rising prices in Britain, the lack of raw materials, and the poor economic situation can barely implement the current plan, but it is still unable to fully fulfill its promise." French Minister of Defense Pidault, who accompanied the French Foreign Minister and Finance Minister to the meeting, said: France "is shouldering a heavy financial and military burden" in the Indochina war, "... the expenditure in Indochina greatly affects the French economy." Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Gasperi also raised Italy's serious unemployment problem, requesting that the United States "must make greater efforts" to assist the Italian ruling group. All representatives of the US vassal states attending the meeting unanimously complained that the burden of arms expansion and war preparations was "unfair" and insisted that the United States should be responsible for most of the "burden of rearmament."

    Faced with these counter-demands from the vassal states, the menacing US delegation was at a loss, and had to simply reject the demands of the vassal states. According to the Associated Press, the US delegation categorically stated that "the governments of extremely difficult European countries should not expect any additional assistance from the United States beyond what Congress has already approved." This situation made the United Press only sigh: For the serious economic situation in Europe, "the US government has no ready-made panacea." In this way, since the United States could not meet the demands of the vassal states, its demands for the vassal states to accelerate arms expansion and war preparations were not achieved. An Associated Press Ottawa dispatch on the 20th said distressedly: "The question of Western European countries' ability to respond to Eisenhower's request for more personnel and weapons is a question that the Ottawa meeting has not found an answer to."

    In addition to economic issues, other US attempts were also opposed at this meeting. Denmark, Norway, and some other countries continued to oppose the US pre-determined plan to formally include Greece and Turkey in the North Atlantic Treaty during the early stages of the meeting. The ruling groups of these countries were afraid that the participation of Greece and Turkey would expose the falsehood of the claim that this group was of a "regional" nature, and would drag the Nordic countries into wars in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions. It was only after the United States exerted great pressure that Denmark, Norway, and other countries finally reluctantly expressed their support for the US decision.

    When commenting on this Ottawa meeting, the American bourgeois newspapers had to admit that the opposition of the broad masses of people made the US war preparation policy encounter difficulties. The "Baltimore Sun" said: The ruling groups of some Western European countries "oppose" the US's request for them to increase military appropriations because they are afraid of the political expressions of the people in their countries. Hearst's "New York Journal-American" commentator Brown worriedly pointed out: The number of people in Western Europe who oppose war is constantly increasing.

    Soviet "Pravda" commentator Korionov pointed out in his commentary on the Ottawa meeting: Judging from the progress and results of the meeting, two conclusions can be drawn. One is that the US ruling group, dissatisfied with the existing scale of the arms race, is therefore putting more pressure on their vassal states, demanding that they accelerate their war preparations even more. Another conclusion is that the contradictions between the countries of the North Atlantic Group are deepening, and behind-the-scenes quarrels and discord are constantly increasing. The relationship within this group obviously cannot be any other way, because this group was established for plunder and aggression, to make the countries of this group succumb to the will and delusions of arrogant American adventurers.

    北大西洋侵略集团在渥太华举行会议
    美国胁迫各附庸国家加紧在欧洲备战
    会议暴露侵略集团内部困难严重矛盾尖锐
    【新华社二十五日讯】紧接着美英法三外长会议在华盛顿举行以后，北大西洋侵略集团理事会会议已于九月十五日至二十日在渥太华举行，出席会议的有北大西洋公约十二个缔约国的外交部长以及财政或经济部长。这是北大西洋侵略集团在推进其战争计划方面的一个重要会议。
    美国在这个会议上的目的，是要胁迫各附庸国接受华盛顿会议的决议，以进一步扩大在欧洲备战的规模。会议结果通过了美英法三外长会议关于大规模武装西德的决定，即与西德缔结所谓“和平协定”并组织以西德军队为骨干的“欧洲军”计划。会议又同意让希腊及土耳其参加北大西洋公约，把这个侵略集团扩大到中东。会议并表示支持美英法三国企图片面修改对意大利和约的阴谋，准备废除和约中规定意大利军队不得超过二十五万人的条款，让意大利“平等地”提供炮灰。
    这个会议就这样向全世界暴露了北大西洋集团在美国指挥下决心进一步推进其战争政策，但是，它同时也暴露了这个侵略集团在推进其战争政策时所遭到的严重困难，及其内部矛盾的尖锐化。
    北大西洋集团所遭到的困难，首先就是因扩军备战而来的经济危机已极度严重，无法解脱。连渥太华会议的公报也无可奈何地承认：“防务生产局和财政经济局的报告以及会上就这些报告所进行的讨论，显示了要确保……（扩军备战）之继续进展有若干困难。理事会已注意到通货膨胀的危险，由于防务（应读为备战）努力的增加在平衡收支方面所造成的负担，由于原料供应在价格与分配上所受到的压力而对充实防务所造成的障碍。”
    这种严重的经济危机已成为美国战争计划的致命弱点，而且它是孕育着北大西洋集团内部不断发展着的矛盾的根源。在渥太华会议上，美国曾粗暴地胁迫其附庸国加速扩军备战。美国国务卿艾奇逊在会议期间发表的广播演说中明白宣称：各附庸国必须“尽它们的最大能力建立军事力量”。同时，北大西洋侵略军总司令艾森豪威尔更向会议具体地提出了要求西欧各国提供随时可用的军队近一百个师，总兵力一百二十万人。但是美国所得到的回答却是一片拒绝。本来，各国财政或经济大臣破格地参加理事会是为向美国诉苦来的，他们一致表示无法接受美国的命令。据合众社透露：英国财政大臣贾兹克尔在会上说：“英国愿意完成目前的重整军备的义务，可是在目前情况下，无法加速进行或扩大扩军计划……。英国物价上涨，原料缺乏，经济状况不佳，固然能勉强实行目前的计划，但仍没有能够完全实现自己的诺言。”随同法国外交部长与财政部长出席会议的法国国防部长皮杜尔说：法国在印度支那战争方面“正肩负着沉重的财政和军事的负担，……在印度支那的支出大大影响了法国的经济”。意大利总理兼外交部长加斯贝利也提出意大利严重的失业问题，要求美国“必须尽更大的努力”协助意大利统治集团。所有出席会议的美国各附庸国家的代表都一致抱怨扩军备战的负担“不公平”，坚持美国要负责大部分“重整军备的负担”。
    在这些附庸国家的反要求面前，气势汹汹的美国代表团一筹莫展，只得干脆拒绝各附庸国的要求。据美联社称，美国代表团断然表示“极度困难的欧洲国家政府不应该希望自美国得到除了国会已经通过的以外的任何额外援助”。这种情况使合众社也只有叹息：对于欧洲的严重的经济情况，“美国政府拿不出什么现成的万灵药来”。这样，美国既然不能满足附庸国的要求，它要各附庸国加速扩军备战的要求也就没有能达到目的。美联社渥太华二十日电苦恼地说：“西欧国家响应艾森豪威尔要求拿出更多人员及武器的能力问题，是渥太华会议所没有找到答案的问题。”
    在经济问题以外，美国其他的企图也曾在这次会议上遭到反对。丹麦、挪威以及某些其他国家在会议初期继续反对美国所预先决定的让希土两国正式参加北大西洋公约的计划。这些国家的统治集团害怕希土两国参加会暴露这个集团的“区域”性质的说法的虚妄，并且会把北欧国家卷入地中海及中东地区的战争。只是由于美国在大施压力以后，丹麦、挪威等国才终于勉强表示支持美国的决定。
    美国资产阶级报纸在评论这次渥太华会议时不得不承认，是广大人民的反对使美国备战政策遭到困难。“巴尔的摩太阳报”说：某些西欧国家的统治集团“反对”美国要他们增加军事拨款的要求，是由于他们怕他们国家的人民在政治上的表示。赫斯特系“纽约人日报”评论员布朗忧虑地指出：西欧反对战争的人数正在不断增加中。
    苏联“真理报”评论家科里奥诺夫在评论渥太华会议时指出：从会议的进展及结果看来，可以得到两个结论。一个是美国统治集团由于不满军备竞赛的现有规模，因此对他们的附庸国加以更多的压力，要求它们更加速备战。另一个结论是，北大西洋集团国家间的矛盾正在日益加深，幕后的争吵和不和正在不断增加。这个集团内部的关系也显然不能有别的样子，因为这个集团的建立是为了掠夺和侵略，为了使这个集团的国家屈从傲慢的美国冒险家们的意志和狂想。
