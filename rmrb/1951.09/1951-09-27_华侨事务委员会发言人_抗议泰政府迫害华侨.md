    Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Spokesperson
    Protests Thai Government's Persecution of Overseas Chinese
    The Thai government has recently used the pretext of "checking identity cards" to persecute our overseas Chinese compatriots in Thailand. A spokesperson for the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government has issued the following statement on this matter:
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government have issued solemn statements and protests regarding the Thai government's crimes of persecuting our overseas Chinese. However, the Thai government has not stopped its various anti-Chinese measures in the slightest degree, but has instead intensified its persecution of the broad masses of our overseas Chinese in Thailand. Recently, the Thai government has even used "checking identity cards" as a pretext to extort, detain, and expel overseas Chinese on a large scale. Under this measure, more than 100,000 overseas Chinese have been directly persecuted. Upon investigation, those overseas Chinese who do not have identity cards have either lost them due to war or are overseas Chinese workers who were forcibly conscripted by the Japanese invaders to Thailand during World War II to build the "Siam-Burma Railway," and there are many other unavoidable reasons. Therefore, more than 40 overseas Chinese organizations in Thailand have jointly reasoned with the Thai government, requesting an extension of the deadline for re-applying for identity cards, but were unreasonably rejected by the Thai government.
    Therefore, this commission solemnly declares: The Thai government should immediately stop this anti-Chinese measure; the Thai government shall bear full responsibility for all its acts of persecuting our overseas Chinese.

    华侨事务委员会发言人
    抗议泰政府迫害华侨
    【新华社二十六日讯】泰国政府最近借口“检查随身证”，迫害我国旅泰侨胞。我中央人民政府华侨事务委员会发言人特就此事发表如下谈话：
    中央人民政府外交部与华侨事务委员会，对于泰国政府迫害我华侨的罪行，曾经发表过严正的声明与抗议。但是，泰国政府迄今未丝毫停止其各种排华的措施，反而日益加紧迫害我旅泰广大侨胞。最近泰国政府竟以“检查随身证”为借口，大规模地敲诈、拘捕与驱逐华侨。在此措施下直接受到迫害的华侨达十余万之众。查我华侨无随身证者，或因战乱失落，或为在第二次大战期间被日寇强征赴泰修筑“暹缅铁路”之华侨工人，其他亦多有其不得已之原因。因此，四十多个旅泰华侨团体曾联名向泰国政府据理力争，要求延长补办随身证的期限，但竟遭泰国政府的无理拒绝。
    为此，本会特郑重声明：泰国政府应立即停止这种排华措施；对其所有一切迫害我侨民之行为，泰国政府应负完全责任。
