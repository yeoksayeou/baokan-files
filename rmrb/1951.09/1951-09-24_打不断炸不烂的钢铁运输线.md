    The Indestructible Steel Transport Line
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter You Lu
    As the news of victories from the Korean front reaches us time and again, we cannot help but think of those who are fighting day and night on the transport lines to support the frontline troops. Without their arduous struggle and selfless work, victory would be impossible.
    This transport force is extremely large and complex. Cars, trains, handcarts, rakes, civilian laborers, members of engineering corps, and logistics station personnel—all of these make up our indestructible steel transport line.
    These people volunteered from various regions and different jobs to participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The vast majority of them had no experience in modern logistics and transportation work in the past. But they have now been tempered into excellent logistics personnel through practical work. This process of going from inexperience to experience, from unfamiliarity to proficiency, is an extremely arduous struggle. They put forward the slogan "Use your brains and learn from practice." A vigorous "learn-by-doing movement" unfolded enthusiastically from top to bottom along the entire logistics transport line. Responsible personnel at all levels go deep into the field in a planned way, carefully observe, and painstakingly study problems. Leading organs at all levels often send working groups to go deep into the lower levels to collect materials and summarize experiences. Just as the forward combat troops promote military democracy, "Zhuge Liang" meetings are also widely and continuously held on the logistics transport line. After this series of efforts, the work gradually became adapted to the needs of modern warfare. This is one of the main factors why they were able to ensure the glorious victories of the frontline troops in the successive battles of the past ten months.
    The leadership of the Communist Party is the decisive force in ensuring the completion of the transportation tasks. There are hundreds of Communist Party branches on the transportation lines. Tens of thousands of Communist Party members lead the masses to successfully complete the transportation tasks together. Thanks to the cultivation and education of the Communist Party, hundreds of people have joined the Communist Party.
    The successful completion of the logistics transportation work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is inseparable from the strong support of the Korean government and the Korean people. On the transportation lines in northern Korea, there is an endless stream of transportation manpower composed of Chinese volunteer laborers and Korean people. They use the back racks and rakes unique to Korea to transport supplies for the Volunteer Army. In order to ensure the smooth flow of roads, the people of each administrative region share the road maintenance tasks of each section. The efficiency of their road repairs is astonishing. One section of a ninety-li long road was destroyed in thirty-three places by enemy planes in one day, but this did not block our transportation. Korean laborers assisted the Volunteer Army's engineers in rushing to repair the road, and filled all the bomb craters before 10 p.m. that night. When the Volunteer Army engineers felt a lack of materials while repairing bridges, the local Korean People's Government immediately found a way to solve the problem. On the railways, tens of thousands of Korean railway employees and the Chinese railway employee aid-Korea contingents are working side by side.
    As the main force on the logistics transportation line, the work of the drivers of the motor transport teams is arduous and laborious.
    In the early days of entering Korea, they fought against the severe cold. The cold wind in the Korean winter blew like knives, and the drivers' faces were blown to bleeding, and their eyebrows, eyelashes, and beards were covered with a layer of frost. Sometimes, in order to start a car that was stuck in the mud when crossing a frozen river, they braved the minus twenty degrees cold to jump into the water to crank the engine, until the engine started, and the cotton trousers became ice buckets when they went ashore. As the rainy season approached, the drivers were plunged into another tense battle. They drove their cars very vigilantly on the winding and steep mountain roads in the pitch-black rainy nights. If they found that the roads and bridges had been washed away by heavy rain and the engineers had not had time to repair them, they had to stop and repair them themselves. When camping, in order to prevent the supplies from being wetted by the rain, the drivers unloaded the four or five thousand catties of materials from the car to a safe place that could avoid the rain. They repaired cars and protected cars during the day, and drove at night, working tensely almost day and night.
    In the modern war being waged on the Korean battlefield, the transportation line is not only a rear supply line, but also a battlefield for fighting against the enemy's air bandits. The American air bandits have exhausted all their vicious means in an attempt to destroy our transportation line. They use a large number of bombs to destroy roads and bridges, strafe our material vehicles, drop hundreds of flares at night, block important intersections on our transportation line, drop countless various types of time bombs on important stations on the railways and highways, and throw large numbers of four-legged nails on the roads to destroy car tires, but in the face of the great Chaozhong (North Korea-China) People's Transportation Team, all the shameful conspiracies and tricks of the American bandits have failed. No matter what new tricks the bandits play, the transport team members have new ways to deal with and smash the enemy's tricks. Despite the enemy's many tricks, our transportation has never been interrupted due to the enemy's frantic destruction.
    On the Korean transportation line, the heroes used tenacious struggle against the enemy to overcome the enemy's so-called "air superiority," and countless glorious deeds have emerged. Heroic driver Zhao Baoyin once shot down an enemy plane with a rifle. Another driver, Zhang Jinrong, was driving a truck loaded with military supplies to the front when enemy planes suddenly dropped a dozen flares over his head. The car was discovered, and two enemy planes circled around his car and strafed it. Zhang Jinrong "fought guerrillas" with the enemy planes. He skillfully and cleverly drove the car, making it impossible for the enemy planes to aim and shoot. He drove for more than sixty li, fought the enemy planes for an hour, and finally defeated the enemy planes' attack and completed the task. During the Third Campaign, driver Zou Zhiming risked the danger of time bombs exploding at any time, moved eight small time bombs to a place thirty meters away, so that the subsequent convoys could quickly rush to the front. There are too many heroic deeds of this kind.
    The revolutionary heroism competition to improve transportation efficiency is flourishing on the transportation line. Many creators of new records have emerged. A certain motor vehicle squadron overfulfilled three emergency transportation tasks by combining the "Red Flag Movement" with the implementation of the contract transportation system. After Zhou Mingsheng created a new record of driving seven hundred and sixty li in one night, Jin Junsheng created a new record of driving eight hundred and ninety li in one night. A certain motor vehicle unit improved the packaging method, and the transportation rate increased by 69% compared with the past. Railway employees, under the slogan of "pulling more, running faster, and going farther," universally carried out the super-axle movement (overcoming difficulties, improving objective conditions, and making the traction of the locomotive exceed the original quota), thus greatly improving the transportation capacity. Under the slogan of "fast loading, fast unloading, and fast transportation," the laborers also launched a loading and unloading competition movement. Due to the improvement of loading and unloading methods, work efficiency doubled compared with the past. According to incomplete statistics, more than 5,000 people's heroes have emerged on the transportation line since entering Korea.
    The staff of the various logistics departments of the Volunteer Army, who have already established great merits, are today persisting in their struggle to consolidate this indestructible steel transportation line.

    打不断炸不烂的钢铁运输线
    新华社记者  尤璐
    当朝鲜前线的胜利消息一次次传来时，我们不能不想到那些为了支援前线部队作战而日日夜夜战斗在运输线上的人们。没有他们的艰苦斗争和忘我的工作，胜利是不可能得到的。
    这个运输阵容极其庞大而复杂。汽车、火车、手推车、耙犁、民工们、工程大队的队员们，还有兵站工作人员，这一切组成了我们的打不断炸不烂的钢铁运输线。
    这些人是从各个不同的地区、各个不同的工作岗位志愿来参加抗美援朝工作的。他们绝大多数的人过去对现代化的后勤运输工作没有经验。但是他们现在已经在实际工作中锻炼成为出色的后勤工作人员。这个由不会到会，从生疏到熟练的过程，是一个极为艰苦的斗争。他们提出了“开动脑筋，从实际中学习”的口号。整个后勤运输线上自上到下热烈地展开了“边做边学运动”。各级负责人员都有计划地深入现场，细心观察，苦心钻研问题。各级领导机关常常派出工作组，深入到下层去收集材料，总结经验。像前方作战部队发扬军事民主一样，在后勤运输线上也普遍地不断地召开了“诸葛亮”会议。经过了这一系列的努力，工作逐渐地能够适应于现代化战争的需要。这是他们所以能够保证前方部队十个多月的作战中，获得历次战役辉煌胜利的主要因素之一。
    共产党的领导，是保证完成运输任务的决定性的力量。在运输线上，有成百个共产党的支部。成千成万的共产党员带领群众一起胜利完成运输任务。由于共产党的培养教育，成百的人参加了共产党。
    中国人民志愿军的后勤运输工作任务的胜利完成，和朝鲜政府与朝鲜人民有力的支援是分不开的。朝鲜北部的运输线上，每天都有着无穷尽的中国志愿民工和朝鲜人民混合组成的运输人流。他们用朝鲜所特有的背架和耙犁，替志愿军运送物资。为了保证公路的畅通，各行政区的人民分担了各段的护路任务。他们修复公路效率之高是惊人的，有一段九十里长的公路，一天内被敌机破坏了三十三处，可是这并没有阻断我们的运输。朝鲜民工们协助志愿军的工兵们突击进行修复工作，于当晚十时前就填平了所有的弹坑。当志愿军的工兵们在修理桥梁感到材料缺乏时，当地朝鲜人民政府就立即设法解决。在铁路上，有千万个朝鲜铁路员工和中国铁路员工援朝大队并肩工作着。
    作为后勤运输线上的主力军——汽车运输队的司机们的工作是艰巨而辛劳的。
    入朝初期，他们曾和严寒作斗争。朝鲜冬季的寒风像刀子一样尖削地迎面吹来，司机们的脸被吹得出血，眉毛、睫毛、髭须黏上了一层冰霜。有时为了开动过冰河时陷入淤泥中的汽车，他们冒着零下二十度的严寒跳进水去摇把子，直到引擎发动，上岸时棉裤都成了冰桶。随着雨季到来，司机们又投入了另一种紧张的战斗。他们在漆黑的雨夜，十分警惕地驾驶着汽车在弯曲险陡的盘山道上行进。中途发现道路桥梁被大雨冲坏而工兵没有来得及修复时，他们还得停下来，自己动手修理。宿营时，为了不使物资被雨淋湿，司机们将车上四五千斤重的物资卸到能避雨而又安全的地方。他们白天修车、护车，夜晚行车，几乎日日夜夜地紧张工作着。
    在朝鲜战场上所进行的近代化的战争中，运输线不仅是一条后方供应线，也是与敌人空中强盗作斗争的战场。美国空中强盗们用尽了一切恶毒手段妄图破坏我们的运输线，他们用大量的炸弹破坏道路和桥梁，扫射我物资车辆，夜间投下成百颗照明弹，封锁我运输线上的重要交叉点，对铁路、公路的重要站口投下数不清的各式各样的定时炸弹，向公路投掷大批四脚钉，以破坏汽车轮胎，但是在伟大的朝中人民运输队工作人员面前，美国强盗的这一切可耻的阴谋诡计都遭到了失败。强盗们玩出什么新花样，运输队员们就有对付和粉碎敌人诡计的新办法。尽管敌人的花样多，我们的运输就从来没有因为敌人的疯狂破坏而中断过。
    在朝鲜运输线上英雄们用坚韧的对敌斗争战胜了敌人的所谓“空中优势”，出现了无数光辉的事迹。英雄驾驶员赵宝印曾用步枪击落敌机一架。另一位司机张金荣正驾驶着满载军用物资的卡车驶向前方，敌机突然在他的上空扔下十数个照明弹，汽车被发现了，两架敌机围着他的汽车扫射，张金荣就同敌机“打游击”。他熟练而巧妙地驾驶着车子，使敌机无法瞄准射击。他开行了六十多里，与敌机搏斗了一个小时，终于战胜了敌机的袭击，完成了任务。三次战役时，司机邹志明冒着定时炸弹随时可能爆炸的危险，将八个小型定时炸弹，移到三十米以外的地方，使后续车队顺利地疾驶前线。这类的英雄事迹太多了。
    提高运输效率的革命英雄主义竞赛在运输线上蓬勃展开。许多新纪录的创造者涌现出来。汽车某中队由于开展“红旗运动”和实行包运制相结合，超额完成了三次包运突击任务。在周明生创造了一夜行车七百六十里的新纪录之后，金君圣又创造了一夜行车八百九十里的新纪录。某汽车部队改善了包装法，运输率较前提高百分之六十九。铁路员工在
    “拉得多、跑得快、行得远”的口号下，普遍开展了超轴运动（克服困难，改善客观条件，使机车的牵引力超过原定量），因而运输力大大提高。民工们在“快装、快卸、快运”的口号下，也掀起了装卸竞赛运动，由于装卸方式改进，工作效率较前提高一倍。据不完全的统计，入朝以来在运输线上已出现了五千名以上的人民功臣。
    已经建树了伟大功勋的志愿军后勤各部门工作人员，今天正为巩固这条打不断、炸不烂的钢铁运输线而坚持奋斗。
