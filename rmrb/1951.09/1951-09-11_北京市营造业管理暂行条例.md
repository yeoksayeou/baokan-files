Simultaneously with the promulgation of these regulations, the Beijing Municipal People's Government also announced the abolishment of the "Amended Provisional Rules for the Administration of the Construction Industry in Beijing Municipality" promulgated on October 15, 1950.

Article 1: These regulations are formulated to promote the improvement of business methods, enrich basic strength, and undertake the capital's construction project tasks for both public and private construction industries.

Article 2: Public construction enterprises should play a leading role in the industry in implementing laws and regulations, improving business management, improving project quality, and reducing project costs. Private construction enterprises should actively strengthen their strength, strengthen their organization, improve their business methods, and become sound construction enterprises.

Article 3: Public and private construction enterprises shall accept the guidance and supervision of the Construction Bureau in their business. Before starting business, they must apply to the Construction Bureau for registration, and may operate their business only after approval, issuance of a license, and a record book for undertaking projects, and registration with the Industry and Commerce Bureau; matters such as closure, suspension of business, and changes in key personnel must be reported to the Construction Bureau and the Industry and Commerce Bureau for approval in advance; for undertaking projects, a contract must be signed with the client, and a copy of the contract together with a material analysis table must be submitted to the Construction Bureau for record, and registered in the record book for undertaking projects. Construction enterprises must not accept projects that violate construction management laws and regulations.

Article 4: Construction enterprises must have certain funds and tools, be equipped with certain technical personnel, and regularly employ a certain number of construction technical workers. Their managers, deputy managers, and employees must be full-time. The Construction Bureau shall classify the construction enterprises according to their specific conditions and stipulate the scope of their undertaking projects (as shown in the attached table).

In order to enable construction enterprises to have sufficient strength to undertake larger projects, the government should encourage and guide small-scale and weak construction enterprises to merge or jointly operate on a voluntary basis. However, in order to guide the sound development of the construction industry, the public-private joint venture or joint operation between private construction enterprises and government agencies or construction companies produced by agencies should be restricted.

Article 5: Construction enterprises undertaking projects must operate directly and are not allowed to subcontract or transfer. However, with the consent of the client, sanitation, heating, water, and electrical equipment related to the undertaking project may be contracted by the construction enterprise to various specialized factories. In order to achieve the purpose of direct operation, construction enterprises must directly employ workers.

Article 6: Construction enterprises undertaking projects must fulfill the original contract. If the client suffers losses due to poor workmanship or materials, or failure to complete the project on time, they shall be liable for compensation.

Article 7: If a construction enterprise achieves excellent results in business management, creation, and invention, thereby promoting production, the Construction Bureau may commend or reward it.

Article 8: If a construction enterprise commits one of the following acts, the Construction Bureau may impose a fine equivalent to 1% to 10% of the project cost or a suspension of business for a certain period. If the circumstances are serious, it may be ordered to close down or be handed over to the court for punishment according to law:
    1. Violating the contract, cutting corners, and the project quality is poor;
    2. Subcontracting or transferring projects;

The Construction Bureau may, according to the specific conditions of each construction engineering team, refer to the scope of undertaking projects for construction enterprises and approve its undertaking projects.
