Xinhua News Agency, September 19th – After being forced to partially admit the strafing incident on September 10th, the US side is making various excuses, particularly attempting to fundamentally deny the Kaesong airspace neutralization agreement in order to evade the serious responsibility of US aircraft repeatedly violating the Kaesong neutral zone. On September 17th and 18th, Ridgway Headquarters successively issued so-called "Situation Reports" and "Communiqués," denying the serious responsibility of US aircraft constantly intruding into and attacking the airspace above the Kaesong neutral zone. The "Situation Report" of Ridgway Headquarters on the 17th, while denying the responsibility for more than 200 sorties of US aircraft intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone airspace since September 1st, stated: "There has never been an agreement not to fly over Kaesong." The "Communiqué" of the 18th further stated: "There has never been an agreement prohibiting aircraft from flying over the neutral zone that has been approved." This statement by the US side is completely a lie. The truth is: In Ridgway's letter to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai on July 13th, he proposed: "During the entire period of our meetings, both sides agree not to engage in any kind of hostile action within the neutral zone." The so-called any kind of hostile activity, of course, includes hostile actions such as air force patrols and reconnaissance. If the US side strictly adhered to this neutralization agreement, there would be no need for specific regulations prohibiting aircraft from flying over the neutral zone. However, since the establishment of the Kaesong neutralization agreement on July 14th, US aircraft have constantly violated the agreement and intruded into the airspace above the neutral zone. In view of this situation, our liaison officer raised specific regulations for the neutralization of the Kaesong airspace at the liaison officers' meeting on August 13th. At that day's meeting, the US liaison officer had no choice but to admit that it was illegal for air force aircraft to fly over the neutral zone. On the one hand, he did not deny the fact that US aircraft constantly intruded into the airspace above the Kaesong neutral zone, and on the other hand, he ridiculously and shamelessly denied that US aircraft were flying in the airspace more than five miles above Kaesong, which could not be considered an infringement of the Kaesong neutral zone. On August 14th, the US liaison officer formally expressed his willingness to respect the neutrality of the airspace above the Kaesong neutral zone at the liaison officers' meeting and declared that the aircraft used by the US delegation were not among those prohibited from flying into the airspace above the Kaesong neutral zone. However, the US liaison officer also claimed that in the event of uncontrollable situations, such as poor weather or low cloud cover, it could not be guaranteed that US aircraft would not fly into the neutral zone. Our liaison officer did not agree to this reservation by the other party. On August 15th, the US liaison officer clearly stated: "Our side does not attempt to have our aircraft fly into the airspace above the Kaesong neutral zone." On August 16th, the US liaison officer at the liaison officers' meeting formally announced agreement in principle to the specific regulations proposed by our side that both sides' armed forces, including aircraft, should not enter the neutral zone and its airspace and should not attack the neutral zone.

The communiqué and so-called "situation report" of Ridgway Headquarters, on the one hand, try to deny the existence of this already achieved Kaesong airspace neutralization agreement, and on the other hand, try to deny the fact that US aircraft flew over the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone. The communiqué of Ridgway Headquarters on the 18th stated: "The United Nations Command has taken all possible precautions since the Kaesong area was declared a neutral zone to avoid United Nations aircraft flying over the Kaesong area." It also said: "After a thorough investigation of each accusation by the Communists that United Nations aircraft had flown over the neutral zone, we found that only one had a factual basis." "Only one aircraft was involved in the incident, while the Communists said that in the first eight days of September alone, United Nations aircraft flew over the neutral zone as many as 139 times." In this way, the fox finally revealed its tail, and Ridgway Headquarters once again found itself in a self-contradictory and embarrassing situation. Since "there is no agreement prohibiting aircraft from flying over the neutral zone," why should Ridgway Headquarters "take all possible precautions to avoid United Nations aircraft flying over the Kaesong area"? Why should it conduct "thorough investigations" into "every accusation by the Communists that United Nations aircraft had flown over the neutral zone"? Why should it argue that "only one aircraft was involved in the incident" and insist on denying the fact that a total of 139 sorties of US aircraft "flew over the neutral zone" in the first eight days of September? Why did US liaison officers Kenney and Darrow, when investigating the incident of US aircraft attacking the neutral zone, stubbornly deny that US aircraft were flying in the airspace outside the neutral zone, or even that no aircraft were flying at all, for US aircraft that were clearly flying over the neutral zone?

This self-contradictory and unsustainable defense and denial by Ridgway Headquarters cannot deny the crimes of US aircraft repeatedly undermining the neutralization of Kaesong, and is precisely a powerful refutation of their repeated undermining of the neutralization of Kaesong.
Xinhua News Agency, September 19th – TASS, Pyongyang, September 18th: "Labor News" published an article entitled "Why Does Ridgway Demand to Change the Address of the Ceasefire Negotiations?"

The article wrote: Everyone knows that the two sides had reached an agreement on the issue of the negotiation address. However, the US side has not honestly fulfilled this agreement, but has repeatedly provoked and attacked the neutral zone.

Ridgway's provocative behavior is irrefutable and undeniable, so he is now trying to deceive world opinion again by demanding a change of address to continue negotiations, and blaming everything on the Korean side. However, the whole world knows that the Korean side has done everything in its power to ensure the smooth progress of the negotiations and to make Kaesong a truly neutral area. And the US side's policy is obviously insincere and hypocritical.

Ridgway said: If negotiations continue in Kaesong, the negotiations will inevitably be obstructed. It is clear from this sentence that the US side not only wants to evade responsibility, but is also planning to sabotage the Kaesong negotiations. Ridgway's suggestion fully exposes the intentions of the US imperialists, who were forced to accept the negotiation proposal under the pressure of world opinion. After agreeing to hold negotiations, they secretly tried every possible means to expand the war.

The newspaper then pointed out: It is clear to everyone that the problem is not the address of the negotiations, but whether the US side sincerely hopes to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. At least one thing is clear, and that is that the US imperialists' provocative behavior in the Kaesong neutral zone and their stubborn demand to change the venue are all used to cover up the aggressors' malicious conspiracy to sabotage the negotiations.

### 李奇微总部又一次露出了狐狸尾巴  发表“情况汇报”和“公报”，自相矛盾无法自圆其说  一面力图否认中立化协议，一面又抵赖美机侵入中立区

    李奇微总部又一次露出了狐狸尾巴
    发表“情况汇报”和“公报”，自相矛盾无法自圆其说
    一面力图否认中立化协议，一面又抵赖美机侵入中立区
    【新华社十九日讯】美方在被迫部分承认九月十日的扫射事件之后，正多方进行辩解，特别是妄图根本否认开城上空中立化的协议，以推卸美机历次破坏开城中立区的严重责任。九月十七、十八两日，李奇微总部接连发表了所谓“情况汇报”和“公报”，抵赖美机不断侵入开城中立区上空并进行袭击的严重责任。李奇微总部十七日的“情况汇报”在抵赖九月一日以来美机侵入开城中立区上空二百多架次的责任时说：“从来没有不飞越开城上空的协议”。十八日的“公报”又说：“从来就没有什么禁止飞机在中立区上空飞行的协议曾获得批准。”美方的这种说法完全是撒谎。事实的真相是：李奇微七月十三日给金日成、彭德怀两位将军的信中，曾提议过：“在我们的会议的整个时期中，双方同意在中立区内不作任何种类的敌对行动。”所谓任何种类的敌对活动，当然包括空军的巡逻侦察等敌对行动在内。如果美方严格遵守这一中立化协议，就根本不需要禁止飞机飞越中立区上空的具体规定。但自从七月十四日成立了开城中立化协议以后，美机即不断破坏协议，侵入中立区上空。鉴于这种情况，我方联络官在八月十三日在双方联络官会议上提出开城上空中立化的具体规定。在当天的会议上，美方联络官也不得不承认空军飞机飞越中立区上空是非法的。他一方面并未否认美机不断侵入开城中立区上空的事实，一方面却荒谬无耻地抵赖说，美机是在开城五哩以上的空中飞行，不能算作侵犯开城中立区。八月十四日，美方联络官在双方联络官会议上正式表示愿意尊重开城中立区上空的中立，并声明美方代表团所用的飞机，不在不得飞入开城中立区上空之列。但美方联络官又声称遇有不能控制的情况，例如气候不佳，云层过低等时，不能保证美机不飞入中立区。我方联络官对于对方这一保留未予同意。八月十五日，美方联络官明白表示：“我方并不企图将我方飞机飞入开城中立区上空”。八月十六日，美方联络官在双方联络官会议上对我方所提双方武装部队，包括飞机在内，不得进入中立区及其上空并不得向中立区攻击的具体规定，正式宣布原则上同意。
    李奇微总部的公报和所谓“情况汇报”一面竭力企图否认这个已经获致的开城上空中立化协议的存在，一面却又竭力抵赖美机飞越开城中立区上空的事实。李奇微总部十八日的公报说：“联合国军司令部自开城地区宣布为中立区以来，便已采取种种可能的预防，避免联合国军飞机在开城地区上空飞行。”又说：“对于共产党所说联合国飞机曾在中立区上空飞行的每次指责都作了彻底的调查之后，我们发现只有一次是有事实作为根据的。”“只有一架飞机与事件有关，而共产党却说只在九月份的头八天中，联合国飞机飞越中立区上空的竟有一百三十九架次之多。”这样，狐狸终于露出了自己的尾巴，李奇微总部终究又一次使自己陷于自相矛盾的狼狈境地。既然“没有什么禁止飞机在中立区上空飞行的协议”，为什么李奇微总部又要“采取种种可能的预防，避免联合国军飞机在开城地区上空飞行”呢？为什么还要对于“共产党所说联合国军飞机曾在中立区上空飞行的每次指责”，都要作“彻底的调查”呢？为什么还要辩解“只有一架飞机与事件有关”，而坚持抵赖九月份头八天中共有美机一百三十九架次“飞越中立区上空”的事实呢？为什么美方联络官肯尼和戴罗在调查美机袭击中立区事件时，对于明明是正在飞越中立区上空的美机，却要矢口抵赖，硬说美机是在中立区的领空之外飞行，或甚至没有飞机在飞行呢？
    李奇微总部这种自相矛盾、无法自圆其说的辩解和抵赖，不但无法抵赖掉美机历次破坏开城中立化的罪责，而且正是它们历次破坏开城中立化的有力反证。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社平壤十八日讯：“劳动新闻”发表论文，题为“李奇微为什么要求改变停火谈判的地址？”
    论文写道：大家都知道，双方曾在谈判地址的问题上取得协议。但是，美方不是诚实地履行这种协议，而是一再挑衅，袭击中立区。
    李奇微的挑衅行为证据确凿，无法抵赖，于是他现在又竭力想再来欺骗世界舆论，要求换一个地址继续举行谈判，而把一切事情的罪责都推在朝鲜方面。可是，全世界都知道，朝鲜方面尽了它一切力量来使谈判得到顺利的进展，并使开城成为一个真正中立的地区。而美方的政策却十分明显是缺乏诚意的，虚伪的。
    李奇微说：如果继续在开城举行谈判，谈判必然会受到阻挠。从这句话里一眼就看得清楚，美方不仅是想规避责任，而且还在策划破坏开城谈判。李奇微的建议充分暴露了美帝国主义者的用心，他们本来是在世界舆论的压力下才被迫接受谈判建议的。他们同意举行谈判之后就暗中千方百计扩大战争。
    该报然后指出：谁都看得清楚，问题并不在于谈判的地址，而是在于美方是不是诚意地希望和平解决朝鲜问题。至少有一件事情是很明白的，那就是美帝国主义在开城中立区的挑衅行为以及他们顽固地要求改变会址，都是用来掩盖侵略者破坏谈判的恶毒阴谋的。
