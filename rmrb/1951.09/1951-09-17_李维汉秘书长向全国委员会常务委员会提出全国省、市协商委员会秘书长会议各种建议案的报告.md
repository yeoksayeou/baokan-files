Chairman, Standing Committee:

The National Conference of Secretaries-General of Provincial and Municipal Consultative Committees, approved by the Standing Committee, opened and closed simultaneously with the National Conference of Secretaries-General convened by the Government Administration Council. Both conferences engaged in the same discussions on political reports, confidentiality, and the United Front work of government organs. The Conference of Secretaries-General of Provincial and Municipal Consultative Committees further discussed the work of consultative committees at all levels in greater detail and drafted seven specific proposals, requesting the Standing Committee to review them and then either promulgate them for implementation or submit them to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and promulgation. Among them, the nature of the Consultative Committee and its relationship with various parties is a fundamental issue.

Based on materials from various regions and feedback from the conference, there are several principled differences in understanding this fundamental issue. Some believe that the Consultative Committee is an organ of political power or of a political power nature, an administrative or legislative organ, and should establish a vertical system from the central to the local level; some believe that the relationship between the Consultative Committee and various democratic parties and people's organizations should also be a leadership relationship; others regard the Consultative Committee as a subordinate organ of government departments (in some places, local governments issue orders to the Consultative Committee, and some even list the Consultative Committee in the government organizational chart); still others believe that the nature of the Consultative Committee is political consultation, and that political consultation can take various forms, making the Consultative Committee a dispensable and insignificant institution.

After discussion, the following common understandings were largely reached:

    I. The Consultative Committee is an organization for political consultation within the United Front. All parties, groups, or individuals participating in the consultative organs (the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and its National Committee, people's representative conferences at all levels and their consultative committees) are politically bound by the Common Program and various agreements and must not violate them; however, if they fundamentally disagree with important resolutions, they have the freedom to request withdrawal from the consultative organs; in terms of organization, they each maintain their independence. Therefore, the relationship between the National Committee and consultative committees at all levels and the various democratic parties and people's organizations is not a direct leadership relationship; they must handle affairs through consultation and agreement and cannot issue orders.

    II. There is no leadership relationship between the Consultative Committee and the People's Government at the same level. The Consultative Committee is an organ through which the People's Government regularly conducts consultations and obtains suggestions. The relationship between the two sides is very close, and both sides should actively play the role of consultation and suggestion; however, the Consultative Committee itself is not an organ of political power or of a political power nature, nor is it an administrative or legislative organ. Its nature is the same as that of the People's Representative Conference, but it is different from the People's Representative Conference that exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress.

    III. Therefore, the Consultative Committee is also not a subordinate part of the government organs, and the government organs should respect the status and functions of the Consultative Committee.

    IV. Consultative committees that exercise the local functions and powers of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should become subordinate organs of the National Committee. In addition to this, consultative committees at all levels should establish relationships for exchanging experiences and making mutual suggestions, but they can only establish such relationships and cannot establish vertical leadership relationships.

    V. The Consultative Committee is by no means an insignificant organization, but one of the central links in the United Front. A broad United Front relationship exists within it, and major political and policy issues should generally be consulted upon through it. Common issues concerning other democratic parties and people's organizations should also be consulted upon through the Consultative Committee as much as possible according to the wishes of the parties concerned (but not everything has to go through it). The organization of the Consultative Committee is a creation adapted to the characteristics of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. It is important, indispensable, and has the possibility of long-term existence.

Based on the above understandings, the conference passed the "Opinions on the Work of Consultative Committees in Various Regions." This document will be promulgated for implementation after review by the Standing Committee. All attendees reflected that these opinions are relatively clear and will enable the work of the Consultative Committees in various regions to be carried out more comprehensively and thus more regularly, making it a beneficial document.

The work of Consultative Committees in various regions has achieved varying degrees of success, but the common shortcomings are a lack of regular and comprehensive work. "Not regular" is manifested in more temporary crash work and fewer peacetime plans; "not comprehensive" is manifested in more assistance to the government's work and less United Front work in contacting the people, assisting various democratic parties, democratic figures, and people's organizations. The lack of working bodies and full-time personnel is one of the important reasons for these shortcomings, so suggestions have also been made regarding institutions and full-time personnel. In addition, we must ask the People's Governments of various provinces and cities to give the Consultative Committees the due attention and support. In this regard, it is hoped that the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government will issue a notice. Are these appropriate? Please give your corrections! Li Weihan, July 8, 1951

### 李维汉秘书长向全国委员会常务委员会提出全国省、市协商委员会秘书长会议各种建议案的报告

    李维汉秘书长向全国委员会常务委员会提出全国省、市协商委员会秘书长会议各种建议案的报告主席、常务委员会：
    常务委员会批准召集的全国省、市协商委员会秘书长会议，是与政务院召集的全国秘书长会议同时开幕闭幕的。对政治报告、保密问题及政府机关统战工作，两个会议都经过同样的讨论。省、市协商委员会秘书长会议则更详细地讨论了各级协商委员会的工作，拟定了七个具体建议案，提请常务委员会加以审核，分别公布施行或提请中央人民政府政务院通过公布施行。其中关于协商委员会的性质及其与各方面的关系，是一个带基本性的问题。
    依据各地材料及会议中的反映，在这个基本性问题的认识上存在着若干原则性的分歧。有认为协商委员会是一种政权的或政权性质的机关，是行政或立法的机关，并应从中央到地方建立垂直系统的；有认为协商委员会对各民主党派和人民团体的关系，也应该是领导关系的；也有将协商委员会看成政府部门的隶属机关（有个别地方政府对协商委员会以命令行事，有的简直将协商委员会列入政府机构表内）的；也有人认为协商委员会的性质既是政治协商，而政治协商则可有各种方式，协商委员会即成为可有可无、无足轻重的机构。
    经过讨论之后，大体上获得以下的共同认识：
    一、协商委员会是统一战线的政治协商的组织。一切参加协商机关（人民政协及其全国委员会，各级人民代表会议及其协商委员会）的党派、团体或个人，政治上均受共同纲领和各种协议的约束，不得违反；但对重要决议根本不同意时，有声请退出协商机关的自由；至在组织上，则各自保持其独立性。因此，全国委员会和各级协商委员会对各民主党派和人民团体的关系，不是直接领导的关系，要靠协商协议办事，不能以命令行事。
    二、协商委员会与同级人民政府之间互无领导关系。协商委员会是人民政府经常进行协商与取得建议的机关，双方关系甚为密切，双方都应主动地发挥协商建议的作用；但协商委员会本身不是政权机关或政权性质的机关，不是行政或立法机关。它与人民代表会议的性质相同，但却不同于代行人民代表大会职权的人民代表会议。
    三、因此，协商委员会也不是政府机关的隶属部分，政府机关应尊重协商委员会的地位和职权。
    四、协商委员会代行人民政协全国委员会的地方职权者，应成为全国委员会的下级机关。除此以外各级协商委员会之间应建立交换经验和互相建议的关系，但亦只能建立这样的关系，而不可建立垂直领导的关系。
    五、协商委员会决不是无足轻重的组织，而是统一战线的中心环节之一。它的内部存在着广泛的统一战线关系，重大的政治问题和政策性问题一般均应经过它来协商。其它各民主党派和各人民团体共同有关的问题也要依据有关方面的愿意，尽可能经过协商委员会（但不是一切都要经过）的协商。协商委员会的组织，正是适应于中国新民主主义革命特点的创造，它是重要的，不可缺少的，并有长期存在的可能。
    依据上述各项认识，会议通过了“关于各地协商委员会工作的意见”。此项文件俟常务委员会审核后公布施行。各到会人员反映，这些意见规定得比较明确，将使各地协商委员会的工作进行得更全面些从而更经常些，是一个有益的文件。
    各地协商委员会的工作，是有了不同程度的收获，但普遍的缺点是缺乏经常的全面的工作。不经常，表现在临时的突击多，平时的计划少；不全面，表现在协助政府的工作较多，而联系人民群众、协助各民主党派、民主人士和人民团体的统一战线工作则较少。缺乏工作机构和专职人员，是这些缺点的重要原因之一，因此对机构和专职人员也拟定了建议。此外，则要请各省、市人民政府对协商委员会给以应有的重视和支持。这方面，希望中央人民政府政务院发一通知。是否有当，请予指正！李维汉一九五一年七月八日
