    Welcome, Comrades Ehrenburg and Neruda, Editors:
    Soviet writer Ehrenburg and Chilean poet Neruda have arrived in Beijing to participate in our National Day celebrations. We, the young students, extend our warmest welcome to them!
    Since the founding of New China, the Soviet people have continuously sent their outstanding writers and scholars to China. Famous writer Fadeyev and Simonov participated in the founding ceremony of New China, and scholars Makarova and philosopher Dr. Yudin have come to China to lecture... Now, Ehrenburg and Neruda have come to our capital, which shows how much the Soviet people and the people of the world value the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people!
    At a time when American imperialists are waging a frantic war of aggression, the arrival of Ehrenburg and Neruda in Beijing once again gives us great encouragement. We want to tell them, and let them tell the people of the world: Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have made brilliant achievements in peaceful construction in the past two years; on the Korean battlefield, the Chinese people have demonstrated that they have the power to defeat the American aggressors. The Chinese people resolutely stand in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and strive for lasting peace!

    欢迎爱伦堡和聂鲁达编辑同志：
    苏联作家爱伦堡和智利诗人聂鲁达已经来到北京，准备参加我国的国庆。我们青年学生，对他们表示热烈地欢迎！
    自从新中国成立以来，苏联人民曾不断地派遣他们优秀的作家和学者到中国来。名作家法捷耶夫和西蒙诺夫参加了新中国的开国盛典，学者马卡洛娃和哲学家尤金博士等先后来华讲学……现在，爱伦堡和聂鲁达又来到我国首都，这说明了苏联人民、全世界人民对于中国人民的革命事业是何等的重视！
    正当美帝国主义者进行疯狂的侵略战争的时候，爱伦堡和聂鲁达的来到北京，这再一次给予我们极大的鼓舞。我们要告诉他们，让他们转告全世界人民：中国人民在伟大的毛泽东主席领导下，两年来在和平建设事业上已经有了辉煌的成就；在朝鲜战场上，已表现出中国人民完全有力量击败美国侵略者。中国人民坚决站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，为争取持久和平而奋斗！
