   The True Face of "Reformist" James Yen

   Editor:
    The "Cultural Life Trends" column of the People's Daily on August 17 reported on the article "Self-Criticism and Understanding of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement" published by the Chongqing "Dagong Bao" by Qu Junong. I have also read Qu Junong's self-criticism. Although it exposed some of the collusions between the Mass Education Movement and imperialism, and the reactionary nature of James Yen; it narrated more than criticized, and as the editor said, "overemphasized the objective influence on him," and was not profound enough. The Mass Education Movement is a "representative" organization of reformists in the past in China. This organization, which thoroughly depended on imperialism, simply took off its reformist cloak in the end and directly became a tool of imperialism and the reactionary ruling class. For such an organization, I think it is necessary to give a more meticulous analysis and criticism.
    The Mass Education Movement moved from Beijing to Dingxian in 1923, using the so-called four types of education: livelihood, health, literature and art, and citizenship, to "cure" China's "poverty, weakness, disease, and ignorance," as its theoretical basis. James Yen's discovery of China's "four major diseases" at that time was actually only a conclusion drawn by comparing them with the superficial phenomena of American capitalist society; but regardless of the essence of imperialist invasion, which caused drastic changes in the rural society at that time, and the increasing poverty of the vast number of peasants, it is certain that the Mass Education Movement was not welcomed in Dingxian. What the peasants urgently demanded was how to remove the heavy exploitation pressing on them, but James Yen put on a set of arguments that "education is the driving force for creating construction power," which fundamentally denied the objective law of historical development, and attempted to change history with idealistic ideals. This is also the starting point of all the theories of the Mass Education Movement. At that time, the main sources of funding for the Mass Education Movement were American "donations" and "subsidies," so the significance of opposing imperialism would certainly not exist in the Mass Education Movement. As Qu Junong said: the United States would certainly "appreciate" and praise this reactionary idea. This also destined James Yen's final path of colluding with the reactionary government, selling himself for refuge, and leaning towards imperialism.
    Due to the Mass Education Movement's erroneous theoretical basis and development path, the content of the "four major educations" it promoted in Dingxian was determined. In the notice to the public printed by the Mass Education Movement to persuade farmers to enter civilian schools, there are sentences such as: "With knowledge and learning, you can improve your life and not suffer from hunger and cold"; the song of persuasion also says: "Reading is good, reading is good, reading is invaluable; everyone wants to read, quickly enter civilian school; you can write and calculate, how good the spirit is; you have money to buy real estate, and understand the deed." This is the main countermeasure to cure the "ignorance"! In essence, this not only did not cure the "ignorance" of the peasants, but also blurred the fighting will of the peasants and concealed the exploiting nature of the ruling class. Not only that, at that time, the Mass Education Movement discovered that rural finance was depleted, so it united American donations and banks to grant loans to farmers in the name of rural loans, but weren't the beneficiaries still a small group of local tyrants and gentry! These loans not only did not provide any benefit to China's "poverty" at that time, but also aggravated the exploiting relationship that already existed in the countryside. This also explains why the Mass Education Movement in Dingxian could obtain the "permission" and "welcome" of some feudal forces and landlords, but "could not get the support of the peasants."
    Marx and Engels criticized the "critical utopian socialists" very early in the "Communist Manifesto." They pointed out: "They reject all political, and especially all revolutionary action; they wish to attain the ends by peaceful means, and endeavour, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel." ("Communist Manifesto," Moscow Centennial Memorial Chinese Edition, page 76) They also said: "To realise all these castles in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois." (Ibid., page 77) Although these words are not a direct criticism of the Mass Education Movement, they are helpful for us to understand the Mass Education Movement. I hope that Qu Junong and comrades who are familiar with the Mass Education Movement will make a more in-depth and systematic criticism of the Mass Education Movement.

### “改良主义者”晏阳初的真面目

   “改良主义者”晏阳初的真面目编辑同志：
    八月十七日人民日报“文化生活动态”栏，报道了重庆“大公报”发表瞿菊农的“自我检讨及对于中华平民教育促进会的认识”一文。我也曾读过瞿菊农的这篇检讨。虽然它揭露了一些平教会与帝国主义勾结的一些情形，及晏阳初反动的本质；但它叙述多于批判，正如编者所说，“过多地强调了客观对他的影响”，还是不够深刻的。平教会是改良主义者在过去国内有“代表性”的机构。这个彻头彻尾依附于帝国主义的组织，在最后干脆卸下了改良主义的外衣，直截了当地做了帝国主义及反动统
    治阶级的工具。对于这样的一个组织，我认为给予更缜密的分析与批判，是有其必要的。
    平教会是一九二三年由北京迁往定县，以所谓生计、卫生、文艺、公民四种教育来“医治”中国“贫、弱、病、愚”社会病象，来作理论根据的。而晏阳初当时发现中国的“四大病象”，实际上只是与美国资本主义社会表层的现象比较所得到的结论；而却无顾于帝国主义侵入，引起当时农村社会激剧变化，广大农民生活日益贫困的本质所在，所以平教会的到定县并没有受到欢迎是肯定的。农民迫切的要求是怎样除去压在身上的重重剥削，而晏阳初却摆出一套“教育是造成建设力量的原动力”的说法，这就根本地否认了历史发展的客观规律，而妄图以唯心的理想改变历史。这也就是平教会一切理论的出发点。当时平教会经费的主要来源是美国“捐款”和“补助”，这样，反对帝国主义的意义，在平教会当然不会存在。正如瞿菊农所说：美国见到这种反动思想，自必“欣赏”赞扬。这也就注定了晏阳初与反动政府勾结，卖身投靠，倒向帝国主义一边的最后道路。
    由于平教会的错误的理论根据和发展道路，就决定了其在定县所推行的“四大教育”的内容。在平教会所刊印的劝农民入平民学校的告民众书里，就有着：“有了知识，有了学问，都能改进自己的生活，不受饥寒困苦”的词句；在劝学歌里也说：“读书好，读书好，读了书，无价宝；大家想读书，快入平民校；又能写，又能算，精神多么好；有钱买房地，文契看明了。”这就是医治“愚”病的主要对策了！实质上，这不但没有医治了农民的“愚”病，反而模糊了农民的斗争意志，掩饰了统治阶级的剥削本质。不但如此，当时平教会发现农村金融偏枯，即以美国捐款和银行联合起来，以农村贷款的名义，放款给农民，而受惠的还不是一小撮土豪劣绅！这些贷款，不但没有对当时中国的“穷”有丝毫补益，却助长了农村中已存在着的剥削关系。这也就说明了平教会在定县为什么能得到一些封建势力、地主阶级的“许可”“欢迎”，而“得不到农民的拥护”的道理。
    马克思和恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中，很早就批判了“批评的空想的社会主义者”，他们指出：“他们抛弃一切政治行动，特别是抛弃一切革命行动；他们想用和平手段达到自己的目的，并企图用一些细小和当然不会成功的试验，凭靠实证来为新的社会福音开拓道路。”（“共产党宣言”，莫斯科百周年纪念中文版、第七十六页）又说：“为了建造这一切空中楼阁，他们不得不去请求资产阶级放软心肠和解囊施舍。”（同上书，第七十七页）这些话虽然不是直接对平教会的批判，但对我们在认识平教会上是有帮助的。希望瞿菊农及熟悉平教会的同志对平教会作一更深刻的系统的批判。
