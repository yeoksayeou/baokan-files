    The Comic Book "Yun Guniang" Distorts Land Reform Policy
    To the Editor:
    After reading "Yun Guniang" (published by Shanghai Lianlian Bookstore), I believe this comic book makes serious mistakes. The story of the comic book is as follows: The protagonist, Yun Guniang, suffered all kinds of oppression and trampling under the evil landlord Qian Youfu in the old society, living a life worse than that of a beast of burden. After liberation, Yun Guniang was emancipated. At the mass accusation meeting of land reform, the landlord Qian Youfu confessed his past "mistakes," believing that he was too "muddled" in the past; and from then on, he wanted to reform himself and was willing to donate a portion of his property to Yun Guniang as compensation. This action was supported by Liang, the land reform cadre, and the masses also agreed with Liang's method.
    From this book, it can be seen that the author not only distorted the land reform policy of the People's Government, portraying the class enemy—the landlord—as a good citizen who is good at confessing and apologizing, but also "donating property to do good deeds." The book portrays our land reform cadre, Liang, not as leading the peasants and landlords in a resolute struggle, but as a person who protects the landlords and speaks from the landlords' point of view. This kind of story that distorts the class struggle will not only fail to enlighten and educate the masses, but will also blur their awareness of the necessity of carrying out the struggle against the landlord class.
    In general, this kind of comic book, which lacks educational significance, violates policy, and blurs the class struggle, should be strictly reviewed and dealt with. The authors of these comic books should step up their study of policy and improve their political and ideological level so that they can produce realistic, moving, and educational works that are loved and heard by the masses.

### 连环图画“芸姑娘”歪曲了土地改革政策

    连环图画“芸姑娘”歪曲了土地改革政策编辑同志：
    我看了“芸姑娘”（上海连联书店出版）以后，认为这本连环画犯了严重的错误。连环画的故事是这样的：主角芸姑娘在旧社会受尽了恶霸地主钱有富的压迫和蹂躏，过着牛马不如的生活。解放后芸姑娘翻了身，在土地改革群众控诉大会上，地主钱有富坦白了过去的“错误”，认为过去太“糊涂”了；并且从此要改过自新，情愿将一部分财产捐给芸姑娘作为赔偿。这种举动并得到了土地改革干部梁同志的支持，群众也同意了梁同志的办法。
    从这本书可以看到作者不但歪曲了人民政府的土地改革政策，把阶级的敌人——地主描写成了善于坦白赔不是的良民，而且还“输出财产充善举”。书中把我们土地改革中的工作干部梁同志描写得不是去领导农民和地主进行坚决的斗争，而是成了袒护地主、站在地主的立场为地主说话的人。这种歪曲阶级斗争的故事，使群众看了不但不能从中得到启发和教育，反而会使他们模糊了对地主阶级进行斗争的必要性。
    总的说来，这种缺乏教育意义、违反政策和模糊阶级斗争的错误连环画是应该加以严格审查处理的，这些连环画的作者应该加紧学习政策，提高政治思想水平，才会产生真实动人而且有教育意义的为群众喜见乐闻的作品。
