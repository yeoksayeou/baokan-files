    The East China region achieved significant results in forestry work during the first half of this year. The entire region afforested over 458,000 mu (approximately 75,443 acres) in the first half of the year, exceeding the annual afforestation plan by 49 percent. The masses planted over 71.2 million trees, exceeding the annual tree planting plan by more than double. In terms of seedling cultivation and closing hillsides for afforestation, 88 percent and 82 percent of the annual plans were achieved, respectively. At the same time, organizations for mountain and forest protection were greatly strengthened. In the first half of the year, 790 new forest protection committees and sub-committees, and 6,519 forest protection groups were established, with over 63,300 participants.

    The most significant progress in forestry work in the East China region during the first half of this year was the gradual shift from guarding forests and public afforestation to organizing the masses for self-collection, self-cultivation, and self-afforestation. Over the past six months, with the exception of northern Anhui, the area of private and public-private cooperative afforestation in various provinces and regions has greatly exceeded that of public afforestation. In Shandong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, the area of private and public-private cooperative afforestation accounted for about 90 percent of the total afforestation area of the three provinces. In the afforestation work, responsible cadres of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government at all levels took the lead in mobilizing the masses. Many counties and districts have formed mass afforestation movements, and a large number of model workers and activists have emerged. The county head of Yena County (newly established county) in Shandong and responsible cadres of the county Party committee personally led and participated in the coastal afforestation work. After hearing the government's call for closing hillsides for afforestation, Yang Zhongli and Wei Chongqi, farmers of Dongxing Village in Laiwu County, actively promoted the benefits of afforestation and took the initiative to assist village cadres in organizing forestry committees and afforestation groups, promoting afforestation in all 51 villages in the area.

    The East China region has an estimated 63 million mu (approximately 10.4 million acres) of forest, many of which have reached felling age; and over 270 million mu (approximately 44.5 million acres) of barren mountains and wastelands that can be used for afforestation. Based on the development of forestry work in the first half of the year, the entire East China region is now in a position to carry out large-scale forestry construction work. For this reason, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the East China Military and Political Committee convened a regional forestry work conference to determine that comprehensive mountain and forest protection should be carried out in the future, extensively mobilizing the masses for self-collection, self-cultivation, and self-afforestation. In addition to focusing on the construction of protective forests, economic forests should also be developed. In areas with barren mountains and wastelands, closing hillsides for afforestation should be combined with large-scale artificial afforestation to quickly eliminate barren mountains and wastelands.

    华东区超额完成今年上半年造林计划
    华东林业工作会议确定今后应全面进行护林造林
    华东区今年上半年的林业工作有很大成绩。全区今年上半年共造林四十五万八千余亩，已超过全年造林计划的百分之四十九；群众植树七千一百二十余万株，已超过全年植树计划的一倍以上；育苗和封山造林方面，亦已分别达到全年计划的百分之八十八与百分之八十二。同时护山护林组织也大大加强，今年上半年新成立了七百九十个护林委员会与分会，六千五百十九个护林小组，参加人数达六万三千三百余人。
    华东区今年上半年林业工作的进展，最显著的便是已逐步由护场看林、公营造林，走向组织群众自采、自育、自造的正确方向。半年来，除皖北外，各省、区私营与公私合营的合作造林的面积，大大超过了公营造林的面积。山东、福建、浙江私营与公私合营合作造林的面积，均占该三省造林总面积百分之九十上下。造林工作中，各地中国共产党及人民政府的负责干部纷纷亲自动手，发动群众，已有不少县、区形成了群众性的造林运动，涌现出大批劳动模范和积极分子。山东掖南县（新设县）县长、中共县委员会负责干部等亲自领导并参加了海滩造林工作。莱芜县东邢村农民杨忠立、魏崇祺听到人民政府号召封山造林后，即到处宣传造林的好处，主动协助村干部组织林业委员会与造林小组，推动全区五十一个村都进行了封山造林工作。
    华东区约计有六千三百余万亩森林，其中不少林木已届采伐年龄；又有二亿七千余万亩荒山荒地，可以利用造林。根据上半年林业工作发展的情况来看，目前华东全区已具备大规模展开林业建设工作的条件，为此，华东军政委员会农林部曾召开了全区林业工作会议，确定今后应全面进行护山护林，广泛发动群众自采、自育、自造，除以营造保安林为重点外，并配合营造经济林；在有荒山荒地地区要以封山育林结合大规模人工造林，迅速消灭荒山荒地。（新华社）
