Xinhua News Agency, September 14th:

    In the first half of this year, industry and commerce across the country continued to improve, generally showing a shift from off-season to peak season.
    In the first half of the year, the number of private industrial and commercial establishments opening in cities across the country exceeded the number closing. According to statistics from fifteen cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, Qingdao, Jinan, Kaifeng, Changsha, Nanning, Changde, Gui Sui, Shijiazhuang, and Ulanhot, the net increase in industrial and commercial establishments after offsetting openings and closings in the second half of last year was 25,421, while in the first half of this year, the net increase was 40,648.
    The number of employed workers in various regions increased significantly. According to incomplete statistics from provinces and cities across the country from January to June this year, the number of employed workers increased by more than 120,000. Technical employees in various regions are almost fully employed; public and private enterprises generally feel that there is a shortage of technical employees.
    From January to June this year, national industrial and commercial tax revenue increased by more than one and a half times compared to the same period last year, and goods tax increased by 90% compared to the same period last year. In Chinese history, the second quarter of each year is the slackest season for industry and commerce and also the season with the lowest tax revenue; however, judging from the situation in July and August this year, tax revenue will definitely increase quarter by quarter.
    The improvement in industry and commerce across the country is uneven. Industry is generally better than commerce, because the new China has opened up broad prospects for industry, and China's industry was originally too small; at the same time, there are more unhealthy elements in commerce, so it is inevitable that it will undergo more extensive reorganization.
    In terms of industry, heavy industry generally recovered faster than light industry. Many machine manufacturing factories in Shanghai have already received orders for the end of this year and even next year. Medium and large-sized machine factories in Chongqing are all overwhelmed with work, so small factories are being organized in various ways to concentrate technology, manpower, and capital to accept larger orders. Most of the light industry is rapidly recovering. The match industry is usually one of the slackest industries in the spring and summer seasons, and the situation of sluggish sales was very serious in the first half of last year, but in the first half of this year, Tianjin's match production even increased by 14% compared to the second half of last year. Industries such as cultural and educational supplies, medical equipment, and construction-related industries such as bricks and tiles have generally embarked on a path of development. The most difficult industries are the flour industry in Shanghai and Wuhan and the wool textile industry in Shanghai. These factories are neither located in the raw material production areas nor close to the sales markets. Such unreasonable situations left over from the old China naturally cannot continue.
    Commerce is generally also good, and the best are those related to the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In various regions across the country, especially in cities where land reform has been completed, these industries are developing rapidly. What is gradually declining in commerce is wholesalers. They do not engage in transportation and sales but profit from reselling. As joint venture organizations in various regions are developing and direct contact between producing and selling areas is strengthening, the role of these intermediate businesses is diminishing day by day.
    The improvement of industry and commerce across the country is also uneven between regions. Areas with a stronger industrial base are better than weaker areas, and areas where land reform has been completed are better than areas where it has not been completed. Therefore, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Chongqing are better than Wuhan. In the past six months, most of Wuhan's industry and commerce have also continued to improve. However, this large commercial city, which has always been known as the thoroughfare of nine provinces, has too many intermediate businesses. Now, the difficulties of these industries are gradually increasing.
    The basic situation of industry and commerce across the country in the past six months is that most industries have improved and a small number of industries have encountered difficulties. This shows that China's economic reorganization is continuing and is increasingly moving towards a healthy direction.

### 全国各地工商业继续好转  淡季转为旺季就业职工人数显著增加  我国经济继续改组正向健康方向前进

    全国各地工商业继续好转
    淡季转为旺季就业职工人数显著增加
    我国经济继续改组正向健康方向前进
    【新华社十四日讯】今年上半年全国工商业继续好转，普遍地出现了淡季转旺的景象。
    上半年全国各地城市私营工商业开业的户数比歇业的多。据上海、天津、北京、武汉、重庆、西安、青岛、济南、开封、长沙、南宁、常德、归绥、石家庄、乌兰浩特十五个城市的统计，去年下半年工商业开业户和歇业户相抵，实增二万五千四百二十一户，今年上半年共实增四万零六百四十八户。
    各地职工就业人数显著增加，据今年一月到六月全国各省市不完全统计，就业职工增加了十二万多人。各地技术员工几乎已经全部就业；公私企业普遍感到技术员工不足。
    今年一月到六月全国工商业税比去年同期增加了一倍半以上，货物税比去年同期增加了百分之九十。中国历史上每年第二季度是工商业最清淡，也是税收最少的季节；但是今年的税收，从七八两月的情况看，可以肯定是逐季增加。
    全国工商业好转的情况是不平衡的。工业一般地比商业更好，因为新中国给工业开辟了广阔的前途，而中国的工业本来就太少；同时，商业中不健康的成份比较多，因此不可避免地要经历更广泛的改组。
    工业方面，重工业一般地比轻工业恢复得更快。上海有许多机器制造工厂已经接到今年年底甚至明年的定货。重庆中等以上的机器工厂家家忙不过来，因此小型工厂正在用各种方式组织起来，以便集中技术、人力和资金，接受较大的定货。轻工业绝大部分在迅速恢复中。火柴工业在春夏两季照例是最清淡的行业之一，去年上半年滞销的情况十分严重，但是今年上半年天津火柴的产量甚至比去年下半年还增加了百分之十四。各地文教用品、医疗器械和有关建筑的如砖瓦等行业，已经普遍走上发展的道路。工业中最感困难的是上海和武汉的面粉工业和上海的毛纺织工业。这些工厂既不在原料产地，又远离销售市场。旧中国遗留下的这种不合理情况，自然无法继续。
    商业一般也是好的，最好的是有关城乡物资交流的行业。全国各地，特别是土地改革已经完成地区的城市，这些行业都日趋发展。商业中日渐下降的是批发商。他们不是以运销为业，而是从转手买卖中取利的。由于各地联营组织日渐发展，产地和销地的直接联系日渐加强，这些中间商业的作用就一天天减少了。
    全国工商业的这种好转，地区之间也是不平衡的。工业基础较强的地区都比较弱的地区好，土地改革完成的地区比未完成的地区好。因此，上海、天津、沈阳和重庆，比武汉更好一些。半年来，武汉工商业大部分也是继续好转的。但是，这个历来被称为九省通衢的大商业城市有着过多的中间商业。现在，这些行业的困难逐渐增加了。
    半年来全国工商业的基本情况，便是大部分行业好转和小部分行业困难。这表明我国的经济改组正在继续，而且是日益显明地向着健康的方向前进。
