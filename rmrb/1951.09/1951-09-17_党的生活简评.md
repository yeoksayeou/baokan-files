Brief Commentary on Party Life

    Preventing the Growth of Commandism
    In the movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and purchasing and storing cotton, a commandist work style of being eager for quick results has grown in a small number of cadres in individual regions.
    According to a circular from the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the CCP in Pingyuan Province: In the work of dike restoration, cadres in Runbukou Village, Yuanyang County, coerced the masses, saying: "Everyone must go to restore the dike, and whoever does not want to go is unwilling to resist America and aid Korea." The branch secretary of Qiaoshan, holding a command flag in one hand and a loudspeaker in the other, rode a big horse and led the militia, appearing very imposing. In Huojia, when mobilizing the masses to restore the dike, a village cadre insisted that the masses "voluntarily" sign up to participate, otherwise the meeting would not be dismissed overnight. In the movement to resist America and aid Korea, a cadre in Guanzhuang, Qinyang, proposed: "In the past, we were just shouting slogans, now we must take action, providing people when needed and money when needed. Whoever does not resist America and aid Korea is a counter-revolutionary." He also gathered the masses and said: "Whoever is willing to resist America and aid Korea, stand on the east side; whoever is willing to be a slave of a fallen country, stand on the west side." In the work of controlling counter-revolutionary elements, individual cadres not only expanded the scope of control, controlling hooligans and petty thieves, but even abused their power to control people who spoke dissenting words or had opinions about village cadres. In the work of mobilizing the masses for mutual aid in labor, there were also phenomena of forcibly forming large mutual aid teams and disregarding policies. According to reports from various places, there were also phenomena of coercion and command in the work of purchasing and storing cotton in individual villages. For example, some village cadres in Guanxian County and Tangyin County, Pingyuan Province, once forced the masses, asking: "Do you love the country or not? If you love the country, you must sell your cotton to the state!" Leading cadres in Liu Bazhuang, Xinxiang County, once put forward the slogan of "one-time success." Their plan was: the women's chairman searches for cotton, the village head weighs it, the armed forces minister guards the door, and the militiamen carry the cotton. After the district cadre discovered this, he immediately pointed out their mistake. But the village cadre still said: "If the whole village doesn't report, we can't complete the task without doing this."
    The above-mentioned erroneous work style seriously affects the relationship between the local party and the people, alienates cadres from the masses, and is opposed by the masses. The Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the CCP timely instructed cadres throughout the province to go deep among the masses, carry forward the work style of the mass line, and overcome the erroneous commandist work style, which is completely correct. When assigning tasks, party leading organs at all levels must earnestly explain the policies to the cadres, explain the reasoning, and tell the cadres to patiently conduct full political education among the masses, so that the broad masses understand the significance of these tasks and act consciously. In addition, it is also necessary to promptly inspect the work style of cadres in the movement, commend those cadres with good work style, and criticize those with bad work style, so that the movement advances along the correct path.

    Publicizing the Political Significance of
    Increasing Production and Practicing Economy to Produce Five Million Tons of Grain
    Increasing production and practicing economy to produce five million tons of grain is a serious political task for the working class in state-owned enterprises in Northeast China. However, according to a report in the Dalian People's Daily on September 2nd, many enterprise departments in the Dalian area are not doing enough to publicize this major political task. Some workers still do not know what increasing production and practicing economy is all about. Some believe that "increasing production and practicing economy of grain is a matter for farmers"; some see increasing production and practicing economy as "saving and spending sparingly" and "relieving disaster victims." There are still not many people who can truly understand the increase in production and conservation from the perspectives of consolidating national defense, developing the economy, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and preparing a material foundation for the comprehensive construction of national industrialization. Therefore, although some workers have already begun to pay attention to increasing production and practicing economy, they are ideologically unclear about how to complete this task. Some people only know how to save a few nails, a few ounces of oil, and a few scraps, but do not know how to give full play to the potential production capacity within the workshop to increase production and practice economy. These people will also lack confidence in achieving the plan of increasing production and practicing economy of five million tons of grain.
    The party organizations in enterprise departments must vigorously publicize the political significance of increasing production and practicing economy among the workers. This is the basic key to completing the task of increasing production and practicing economy. It is necessary to profoundly educate the workers, so that they understand why they should carry out this task, and how to give full play to the potential capacity of the workshop to complete this task, so that the call for increasing production and practicing economy of five million tons of grain quickly becomes a large-scale mass movement.

    Oppose Extravagance and Waste
    Recently, when some organs and organizations in Jinan City held large-scale mass representative conferences, they all requested people from all walks of life to send a large number of congratulatory gifts by means of instruction or written request. For example, the Third District People's Representative Conference received more than 20 million yuan in cash, more than 200 banners, as well as amplifiers, radios, tables, chairs, desks, glass plates, teapots, teacups, clocks and other items, totaling more than 400 pieces, with great value. Now some people think that holding a large-scale mass meeting requires the masses to give gifts; otherwise, it will not show solemnity and liveliness. This view is obviously wrong. This is a work style of extravagance and waste. This not only wastes the state and the people's property, but also damages the solemn political nature of the meeting, which is the result of the influence of the old society's ideology and work style. The masses' support and love for these meetings, as well as for the people's government and people's organizations, are not expressed in these forms, but in whether the broad masses have been united around the party, the people's government, and the people's organizations, enthusiastically discussing various tasks, and turning them into the actions of the broad masses. Even if the masses offer congratulations entirely out of their own enthusiasm, they should be advised to use more letters of congratulation and congratulatory messages. This method is better able to express the feelings of the masses.
    After discovering these problems, the Jinan Municipal Committee of the CCP immediately notified its subordinate party committees, and party organizations in various organs and organizations to conscientiously check and correct this formalistic work style of extravagance and waste, which is completely correct. Other places should also take this as a warning.

    党的生活简评
    防止命令主义作风的滋长
    在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命，以及购棉储棉等运动中，在个别地区的少数干部中滋长着急于求成的命令主义作风。
    据中共平原省新乡地委通报：在复堤工作中，原阳润埠口村干部威迫群众说：“人人都得去复堤，谁要不去就是不愿抗美援朝。”桥山支部书记在堤上一手拿着令旗，一手拿着喇叭筒，骑着大马，带着民兵，威风凛凛。获嘉在动员群众复堤时，某村村干部一定让群众“自动”报名参加，否则一夜不散会。在抗美援朝运动中，沁阳官庄干部提出：“过去是空喊，现在要行动，做到要人出人，要钱出钱，谁不抗美援朝就是反革命。”并召集群众说：“谁愿意抗美援朝站到东边，谁愿意做亡国奴就站到西边。”在管制反革命分子的工作中，个别干部不仅扩大管制面，管制流氓、小偷；甚至滥用职权，管制说二话和对村干部有意见的群众。在动员群众劳动互助工作中，也发生强编大互助组、不讲政策的现象。另据各地反映，个别村庄在购棉储棉工作中也有强迫命令的现象。例如：平原省冠县、汤阴县少数村干部曾逼着群众问：“爱国不爱国？爱国就得把你家的棉花卖给国家！”新乡县刘八庄领导干部曾提出“一遍成功”的口号。他们的计划是：妇女主席搜查棉花，村长过秤，武装部长把门，民兵抬棉花。区干部发觉后即指出其错误。但村干部还说：“全村不报，不这样做就不能完成任务。”
    上述错误作风，严重地影响着当地党和人民群众的关系，干部脱离群众，遭到群众的反对。中共平原省委及时地指示全省干部，深入群众，发扬群众路线的工作作风，克服错误的命令主义作风，这是完全正确的。各级党的领导机关布置任务的时候，必须认真向干部讲明政策，说通道理，并告诉干部要耐心地对群众进行充分的政治教育，使广大群众懂得这些任务的意义而自觉地行动起来。此外，还必须及时地检查干部在运动中的工作作风，表扬那些工作作风好的干部；批评那些作风坏的干部，使运动循着正确的道路前进。
    宣传增产节约五百万吨粮食
    的政治意义
    增产和节约五百万吨粮食，是东北国营企业中工人阶级当前的严重政治任务。但据九月二日旅大人民日报反映，旅大地区很多企业部门，对于这一重大的政治任务的宣传是很不够的。有的工人至今还不知道增产节约是怎么一回事情。有的认为，“增产节约粮食是农民的事”；有的把增产节约看做“省吃俭用”，“救济灾民”。真正能够从巩固国防、发展经济、巩固人民民主专政、巩固工农联盟、为国家工业化的全面建设准备物质基础这些观点上去认识增产节约的人还是不多的。因此有些工人虽然已经开始注意增产节约；但究竟怎样来完成这一任务，他们在思想上是不明确的。有人只知道节约几个钉子、几两油，和几块废料，而不知道发挥车间内部的潜在的生产能力，去增产节约。这些人对实现增产节约五百万吨粮食的计划，也就会缺乏胜利信心。
    企业部门的党组织，必须在工人群众中，大力宣传增产节约的政治意义。这是完成增产节约任务的基本关键。要深刻地教育工人群众，使他们懂得为什么要执行这一任务，并怎样地发挥车间的潜在能力来完成这一任务，使增产节约五百万吨粮食的号召，迅速地成为规模宏大的群众运动。
    反对铺张浪费
    近来济南市某些机关、团体在举行较大的群众性的代表会议时，均以授意、函索等方式，要求各界人民送大批贺礼。例如三区各界人民代表会议，即收到现款二千余万元、锦旗二百余幅及扩音器、收音机、桌、椅、写字台、玻璃版、茶壶、茶杯、时钟等物计达四百余件；价值甚巨。现在就有些人以为开一个较大的群众性的会议，非群众送礼不可；否则就表现不出隆重和热闹。这种看法显然是错误的。这是一种铺张浪费的作风。这不仅浪费了国家与人民的资财，而且损害了会议的严肃的政治性，是旧社会思想作风影响的结果。群众对于这些会议，以及对于人民政府、人民团体的拥护与爱戴，不是表现在这些形式上，而是表现在广大群众是否已被团结在党、人民政府、人民团体的周围，热情地讨论各项工作，并把它变成广大群众的行动。即使群众有完全出诸于自己热情的献贺，那也应当劝告他们多用贺信，贺词等方式。这种方式，是能够更好地表达群众的情意的。
    中共济南市委会发现这些问题后，已立即通知所属各党委、各机关、团体中的党组织，认真检查纠正这种铺张浪费的形式主义的作风，是完全正确的。其他各地亦应引以为戒。
