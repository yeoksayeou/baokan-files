Most state-owned enterprises in the Northwest region have not yet paid sufficient attention to the work of asset inventory and capital verification, and many incorrect views persist, which should be quickly corrected. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee organized the "Northwest Region State-Owned Enterprise Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Committee," which began work at the end of June. It stipulated that state-owned enterprises in the Northwest should establish capital verification institutions at all levels before the end of July, complete the inventory work by the end of August, complete the valuation and table creation work by the end of September, and complete the capital verification work by the end of October. However, as of the end of August, the asset inventory and capital verification work of most state-owned enterprises in the Northwest has basically not started. For example, Qinghai and Gansu provinces have not yet established capital verification institutions. The Xi'an Municipal Financial and Economic Committee has not yet held a meeting to study this work, and only formally established a capital verification institution on August 22. Although the Shaanxi Provincial Financial and Economic Committee established a capital verification institution in mid-July, due to the lack of mobilization and inspection, most factories and mines in the province have not yet carried out this work. The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department only allocated cadres and organized the study of capital issues on August 22. The Northwest Agricultural Implement Factory and Qinling Forest Factory, led by the department, only recently began to carry out inventory work.

The reason why the asset inventory and capital verification work of state-owned enterprises in the Northwest has not been done well is mainly because the leading cadres of some units still have incorrect views on this work.

Some people believe that this work is only a matter for the accounting and financial departments and has nothing to do with the workers and masses, so there is no need to mobilize the masses to do this work. Therefore, when establishing capital verification institutions, they do not include trade union cadres. As a result, this work is still being done by a small number of people, and has not formed a mass movement.

Some people think that "it's the same whether capital is verified or not," and "the warehouse was already inventoried last year, so re-inventorying it this year is just superfluous?" Therefore, they are unwilling to establish capital verification institutions, or if they establish institutions, they do not have specific work.

Some are afraid that after capital verification, the higher authorities will take away the surplus capital of their units, which is not "convenient" for their units. Because they only consider the interests of their own units and not the interests of the entire country, they are not active enough in this work.

Some units believe that there are too many central tasks and they are too busy, so they feel that there is no time to do the asset inventory and capital verification work. They put this work in opposition to central tasks such as democratic reform, without considering how to combine these central tasks.

The above-mentioned incorrect views all show that the leading cadres of some state-owned enterprises in the Northwest region have not yet truly established the concept of economic accounting, and have not realized that asset inventory and capital verification work is an important key to running enterprises well. Neglecting this work will inevitably cause a lot of waste and prevent enterprises from being run well. (Liu Zhengxiang)

    西北多数国营企业领导干部忽视清理资产核定资金工作
    西北区多数国营企业对于清理资产核定资金工作还没有重视起来，还有着许多不正确的看法，应迅速纠正。西北军政委员会财政经济委员会曾组织了“西北区国营企业清理资产核定资金委员会”，已于六月底开始工作；并规定：西北国营企业在七月底以前成立各级核定资金机构，八月底完成清理工作，九月底完成估价和造表工作，十月底完成核定资金工作。但截至八月末为止，西北大多数国营企业的清理资产核定资金工作基本上还没有动起来。如青海、甘肃等省尚未成立核定资金机构。西安市财政经济委员会还没有开会研究过这个工作，八月二十二日才正式成立核定资金机构。陕西省财政经济委员会虽然于七月中旬成立了核定资金机构，但由于没有动员与检查，该省大部分厂矿还没有开展这个工作。西北农林部直到八月二十二日才配备干部，组织学习资金问题，该部领导的西北农具厂和秦岭林厂最近才开始进行清理工作。
    西北国营企业清理资产核定资金工作所以没有做好，主要是因为有些单位的领导干部对于这个工作还有不正确的看法。
    有些人认为这个工作仅仅是会计和财务部门的事情，和工人群众没有什么关系，用不着发动群众来做这个工作，在成立核定资金机构时也不吸收工会干部参加。因此，这个工作至今还是由少数人做的，没有形成群众运动。
    有些人以为“核定不核定是一样”，“去年已经清理过仓库，今年再清理，还不是多此一举？”因此他们不愿意成立核定资金的机构，或者成立了机构，却没具体的工作。
    有些人则害怕核定资金后，上级会把自己单位的多余资金提走，对于自己单位是不“方便”的。由于他们只考虑本单位利益，而不考虑整个国家利益，因此他们对于这个工作不够积极。
    有些单位则以为中心工作太多，忙不过来，觉得没有时间来做清理资产核定资金工作。他们把这个工作和民主改革等中心工作对立起来，而不考虑怎样把这些中心工作结合起来进行。
    上述这些不正确的看法，都说明了西北区有些国营企业的领导干部还没有真正树立经济核算的思想，还没有认识到清理资产核定资金工作是搞好企业的一个重要关键。忽视这个工作，就不可避免地造成很多浪费，就不能把企业办好。（柳正湘）
