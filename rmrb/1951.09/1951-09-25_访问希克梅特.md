    Visiting Hikmet
    Chen Shiwu, Lin Ning
    On August 16th, during the Third World Youth Festival, Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet, who had recently been released from prison, received us in the lounge of the Berlin Press Club.
    This specially invited honored guest was one of the most popular figures among young people from various countries at the festival. His ten years of imprisonment under the reactionary rule of Turkey had damaged his health, but his will to fight for peace and the liberation of the Turkish people had been tempered even stronger.
    "I have much to say about China," he began, talking non-stop. We gave him a copy of the "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette) containing the news of his release and arrival in the Soviet Union, along with his articles. He cherished it, flipping through the pages and repeatedly expressing how happy he was to know that his poems and articles would meet with Chinese readers.
    Because the judging committee of the World Youth Literary Competition of the festival was waiting for him to attend a meeting, he had to leave us in a hurry. A few days later, he sent us a short article, pouring out his warm love for the Chinese people. He wrote: "In Turkey, everyone says this: the victory of the Chinese people is a powerful blow to world imperialism, which is exactly what the Turkish people have been eagerly awaiting for a long time." He said that he was very excited to see in Berlin that the representatives of Chinese youth were so happy and vigorous, and that they were the representatives of the great Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.
    Hikmet's short article showed the Turkish people's boundless love for China. During our visit to Hikmet, he introduced us to a Turkish youth and told us about the heroic struggles of the Turkish people. From these situations, we deeply realized that the struggle of the Chinese people and the Turkish people are inextricably linked and are moving towards the same goal.
    This young man said that the news that the Turkish government had sent troops as cannon fodder for the American war of aggression against Korea had caused a great shock among the Turkish people. Disregarding the threat of arrest and court-martial, they carried out the struggle against the aggression against Korea in various ways. The Turkish government felt it was at the end of its rope and even wanted to rely on religion to encourage morale. It launched propaganda saying that Turkish soldiers who died on the Korean battlefield could immediately ascend to heaven, but the false promise of heaven could not help the reactionaries. Even the chief of staff of the Turkish aggressor army in Korea wrote letters to others in low spirits saying: "When I return to the country, I will request retirement, but whether I can return to the country, I don't even know."
    The Turkish people, who are fighting for peace and national independence and liberation, have gained new strength from the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution. This young Turkish friend finally told us: "The victory of the Chinese people has greatly inspired us. Now, the name of Mao Zedong is cheered by the working people and progressive intellectuals in Turkish cities and villages. Mao Zedong's light is shining from the Far East to the Near East, and under the illumination of this light, the fighting spirit and confidence of the people of oppressed nations have greatly increased."

    访问希克梅特
    陈适五、林宁
    八月十六日，正当第三届世界青年联欢节期间，在柏林新闻俱乐部的休息室里，不久以前才出狱的土耳其诗人那齐姆·希克梅特接见了我们。
   这个特别邀请来的荣誉贵宾，是联欢节中最受各国青年欢迎的人物之一。在土耳其反动统治下的十年牢狱的生活，毁损了他的健康，但是他争取和平与土耳其人民解放的意志却锻炼得更加坚强了。
   “关于中国，我有许多话要说”，他一开始就滔滔不绝地谈起来。我们把刊登着关于他出狱抵苏时的消息和他的文章的“文艺报”送给他，他珍惜地翻阅着，一再表示他知道自己的诗文和中国读者见面是多么高兴。
   因为联欢节的世界青年文艺竞赛评判委员会等待他去开会，他不得不匆匆离开我们。几天之后，他写好一篇短文送来，倾吐他对中国人民所怀抱的热烈的友爱。他写道：“在土耳其，大家都这样说：中国人民的胜利是对世界帝国主义的强有力的打击，这也正是土耳其人民所早就迫切地等待着的事情。”他说，他非常兴奋地在柏林看到中国青年的代表是那么幸福和朝气勃勃，他们是毛泽东主席领导下的伟大的中国人民的代表。
   希克梅特的这篇短文表明了土耳其人民对中国的无限热爱。在我们访问希克梅特时，他曾给我们介绍了一位土耳其青年，告诉了我们许多土耳其人民英勇斗争的情况。从这些情况中，我们深深体会到中国人民与土耳其人民的斗争是血肉相关而朝着同一个目标的。
   这位青年说，土耳其政府派遣部队作美国侵朝战争的炮灰的消息在土耳其人民中引起很大的震动。他们不顾逮捕和军法审判的威胁，以各种方式进行反对侵略朝鲜的斗争，土耳其政府感到走头无路，甚至想靠宗教来鼓励士气，它发动宣传说，在朝鲜战场死亡的土耳其士兵可以立即升入天国，但是天国的虚妄诺言并不能帮助反动派。甚至去朝鲜的土耳其侵略军的参谋长都意气消沉地写信告诉别人说：“我回国时将要求退休，但是我究竟还能否回国，我也不知道。”
   为和平与民族独立解放而斗争的土耳其人民，已从中国人民革命的伟大胜利中得到了新的力量。这个土耳其青年朋友最后告诉我们：“中国人民的胜利大大地鼓舞了我们。现在，毛泽东的名字在土耳其受到城乡劳动人民与进步知识分子的欢呼。毛泽东的光芒正从远东照到近东，被压迫民族的人民在这光芒的照耀之下，斗志和信心已大大增长”。
