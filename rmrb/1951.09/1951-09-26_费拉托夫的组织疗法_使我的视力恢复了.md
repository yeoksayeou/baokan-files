Filatov's Tissue Therapy

Restored My Vision
To the Editor:

　　My eyesight had been poor since 1940. At night, my vision was even more blurry. For eleven years, the situation had gradually worsened. After reading too many books and newspapers during the day, I would feel dizzy and my eyes would be blurred. When going out at night, I often bumped into telephone poles and pedestrians. Sometimes, when walking down dimly lit alleys, I would even bump into walls. I don't know how many times things like this happened. As a result, I couldn't read too many books and newspapers during the day, and I didn't dare to go out at night. I had practically become a "blind man with open eyes." This pain was hidden deep in my heart, greatly hindering my desire to make progress. Although I studied medicine, in the past, I never had any hope of recovering my eyesight. I didn't examine it or treat it; I was just waiting for the dreaded blindness.

　　Since the advanced Soviet medical experience was introduced to China, Filatov's tissue therapy brought me hope of regaining my vision. In the spring of this year, when the tissue therapy research group of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Hospital began experimenting with tissue therapy, Dr. Tian Shusheng of the hospital examined and treated me, diagnosing "retinitis pigmentosa in both eyes," with a visual acuity of 0.6 and an abnormally narrow field of vision. After one umbilical cord tissue implantation and eight placental tissue fluid injections, my visual acuity gradually increased from 0.6 to 1.0, and my field of vision also expanded somewhat. During the day, I can read more books and newspapers, and at night, I dare to go out alone. Even writing is no longer a problem. I gradually regained my health, and I am no longer as depressed as before. If I continue to receive treatment a few more times, my eye disease can be completely cured in due time. After more than ten years of incurable illness, once it is cured, how happy I will be! I deeply thank the creators of advanced experience in the Soviet medical science community for bringing happiness to mankind. I also thank the great Soviet Union for continuously helping the improvement and invention of our country's scientific construction with brotherly international friendship.

    费拉托夫的组织疗法
    使我的视力恢复了编辑同志：
    从一九四○年起，我的视力就不好。夜间眼前更是一片模糊。十一年来，情况日渐严重。白天多看了书报，就感到头晕眼花；夜间出门，常常碰上电线杆和行人；有时走到光线较暗的小胡同里，还会碰到墙上；类似这样的事情，不知发生过多少次。因此，白天不能多读书报，夜间不敢出门，我简直变成了一个“睁眼瞎子”。这痛苦一直隐藏在我的心窝里，使我求取进步的心，受到很大的打击。虽然我是学医的，但在过去，我对我的眼疾，从没有抱过复明的希望。我不去检查它，治疗它，我只在等待着可怕的失明。
    自从先进的苏联医学经验传到中国以后，费拉托夫的组织疗法给我带来了复明的希望。今年春季，中央重工业部医院组织疗法研究组开始试验组织疗法时，该院田蜀生大夫为我进行了检查和治疗，判断为“双眼网膜色素变性”，视力○·六，视野异常狭窄。经过一次脐带组织埋藏，及八次胎盘组织液注射，视力渐由○·六增到一·○，视野也稍稍扩大了一些，白天能够多看书报，夜间也敢独自出门了，甚至连写作也没有妨碍了。我逐渐恢复了健康，我再也不像以前那样萎靡不振了。假若继续再治疗几次，到一定的时期，我的眼疾是可以完全康复的。十余年来无可救药的沉疴，一旦痊愈，我该是多么地欢愉啊！我深切感谢苏联的医药科学界的先进经验的创造者，为人类带来的幸福；我更感谢伟大的苏联，以兄弟般的国际友情，不断地帮助我国科学建设的改进与发明。
