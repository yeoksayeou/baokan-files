Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: According to a report by TASS on September 21st, the Japanese newspaper "World News" reported on the 19th that the National Liaison Council for the Reconstruction of the Japanese Socialist Party (i.e., the Reconstruction Faction of the Japanese Socialist Party) has issued a statement protesting the signing of the separate peace treaty. The statement said: "We believe that the separate treaty signed in San Francisco is not a peace treaty. This treaty is a declaration preparing for another world war, and we resolutely oppose it. This treaty must not be ratified. We are determined to launch a nationwide movement to oppose the ratification of this treaty, and we must defend our national independence and peace to the end."

The newspaper also reported that Shigeru Nanbara, President of the University of Tokyo, stated to the press: "The San Francisco Peace Conference is extremely regrettable. On the day the treaty was signed, we should have worn mourning clothes to express our grief." He added, "The arrest of Japanese Communist Party leaders while the attention of our people is focused on the San Francisco Conference is a shameful act."

"World News" also reported workers' opinions on the signing of the separate peace treaty in San Francisco. A state-owned railway worker said: "A peace treaty without the participation of China and India is not a true peace treaty that can establish peace in Asia. Yoshida, who signed the military agreement, is a traitor." A streetcar worker in Tokyo said: "This is actual colonization. We are outraged that the taxes we pay are being used to rearm Japan for the benefit of the United States. We vow to fight against the ratification of the San Francisco Treaty."

"Asahi Shimbun" reported that left-wing Diet members of the Japanese Socialist Party and leaders of the ten largest Japanese labor unions influenced by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held a meeting on September 17th. These union leaders included leaders from organizations such as the All-Japan National Railway Workers' Union and the Japan Teachers' Union. The meeting discussed the Japanese Socialist Party's attitude towards the separate peace treaty signed in San Francisco. The meeting also passed a resolution advocating that the Socialist Party should oppose the ratification of this treaty.

    日本社会党再建派发表声明
    抗议签订单独和约
    决开展全国性运动保卫独立
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社二十一日讯：据日本报纸“世界新闻”十九日报道，日本社会党再建全国联络会（按即日本社会党再建派）顷发表声明，抗议签订单独和约。声明说：“我们认为在旧金山签订的单独和约不是和约。这个条约是准备发动另一次世界大战的宣言，我们坚决反对这个条约。决不可批准这个条约。我们决心开展一个全国性的运动来反对批准这个条约，我们一定要把我们的民族独立与和平保卫到底。”
    该报同时报道，东京大学校长南原繁在对报界发表的声明中指出：“旧金山和会令人极感遗憾。在签订和约的那一天，我们本来应该穿丧服志哀的。”他又说：“在我国人民的注意力集中于旧金山会议的时候逮捕日本共产党领袖，是一种可耻的行为。”
    “世界新闻”还报道工人对在旧金山签订单独和约一事的意见。一个国营铁路工人说：“没有中国和印度参加的和约不是能够建立亚洲和平的真正和约。签订军事协定的吉田是卖国贼。”东京的一个电车工人说：“这是实际的殖民地化。我们缴纳的赋税被用来为了美国的利益而重新武装日本，这实在令人感到万分愤慨。我们誓为反对批准旧金山和约而斗争。”
    “朝日新闻”报道，日本社会党左翼国会议员和受日本工会总评议会影响的十个最大的日本工会的领袖，于九月十七日举行会议。这些工会领袖包括全日国营铁道工人工会和日本教职员工会等组织的领袖。会议讨论了日本社会党对在旧金山签订的单
    独和约的态度。会议并通过决定，主张社会党应当反对批准这个条约。
