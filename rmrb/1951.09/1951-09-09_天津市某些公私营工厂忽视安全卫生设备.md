    Certain State-Owned and Private Factories in Tianjin
    Neglect Safety and Sanitation Equipment
    (I) Editor:
    Based on our inspection of the safety and sanitation work in various state-owned and private factories in Tianjin, we found that some factories are indeed doing a very good job in safety and sanitation. However, the heads of some other factories merely pay lip service to the inspections of the health authorities and disregard our recommendations for improving safety and sanitation work. As a result, the safety and health of workers are affected, which is a significant obstacle to production. I believe it would be beneficial to inform you of these situations to draw the attention of factories and mines in various regions.
    In May of this year, Tianjin State-owned Jianhua Glass Factory injured a worker's arm because the belt on the grinding machine lacked safety equipment. To this day, safety equipment has not been added. Etching degree scales on glassware with hydrofluoric acid is a toxic job (hydrofluoric acid is a toxic chemical with strong corrosiveness that emits toxic gases; inhaling it can cause rhinitis, laryngitis, bronchitis; it corrodes and ulcerates the skin, and chronic poisoning can cause gastrointestinal and neurological disorders, even death). Some workers in the factory have coughed up blood due to inhaling hydrofluoric acid fumes. The workshop is very small, with insufficient air and sunlight. The factory is simply indifferent to the health and protection of workers in this type of work, not even providing masks. According to preventive measures, this type of workshop should be equipped with exhaust and ventilation equipment, and workers must wear gas masks, rubber gloves, and work clothes, and the working hours should be shortened.
    In addition, we inspected most of the battery factories in Tianjin. According to the physical examination data of forty-four workers, more than 80% of the workers suffer from symptoms of lead poisoning. Lead poisoning can cause anemia, abdominal colic, wrist and foot drop or paralysis, etc. Treatment for this disease is limited, so prevention is essential. However, factory leaders often ignore our suggestions, considering improving equipment and issuing work clothes and masks as excessive demands; or they emphasize economic difficulties, making it impossible to solve the problem. For example, the head of Tianjin Private Pacific Battery Factory said, "I have been working in the factory for more than ten years, and I have not seen any symptoms occur." This is an unscientific denial of the danger of lead poisoning. Emphasizing economic difficulties is also incorrect. According to our understanding, Private Gongyu Chemical Factory is very profitable, but the factory has always neglected the health and welfare of its workers. For example, the workshop for compounding dinitrobenzene should have perfect exhaust equipment, but the workshop is full of dust, which causes workers to often experience headaches, vomiting, palpitations, and visual impairment. The factory's shower facilities and other related sanitary equipment are very poor. This tendency to disregard the life and death of workers is simply intolerable.
    Some tanneries and bone glue factories pay little attention to environmental sanitation. For example, the kitchen and dining hall lack fly prevention equipment, resulting in many cases of enteritis in the summer and autumn seasons. The heads of these factories are only calculating that adding fly prevention equipment will cost a lot of money, but they do not see that with fly prevention equipment, worker illness will be reduced, medical expenses will be saved, and sick leave and the many hours workers spend seeking medical treatment will be reduced. In June of this year, the number of employees of the New China Paper Mill who suffered from enteritis and dysentery reached 60% of the total number of employees in the factory, making it almost impossible to start work. After adding fly prevention equipment and paying attention to the dietary hygiene of employees, the number of patients decreased by three-quarters in July. This shows that improving environmental sanitation not only protects the health of workers but also improves attendance and increases production. Therefore, preventive expenses for health work are not a useless waste but a necessary condition for production. We must recognize the importance of safety and sanitation work ideologically because only by protecting the health of workers can we increase production efficiency and do a good job in economic construction.

    (II) Editor:
    At the end of August, the Tianjin Labor Bureau inspected the knitting factory under the Industrial Bureau and found that the factory's boiler had exceeded its service life and was in danger of accidents at any time. Although we requested the factory to take effective measures, it has not yet attracted the attention of the factory leaders.
    According to the technicians who accompanied us to inspect the factory's safety equipment: the factory's vertical two-section boiler has exceeded its service life of fifteen years, and all safety equipment has failed. For example, the pressure gauge, which measures whether the boiler itself exceeds the pressure load, has failed due to cracks and air leaks in the enamel dial. They had to blindly add a few pieces of scrap iron to the pressure gauge hanger and continue to use it, which lost the function of measuring air pressure; many of the rivets on the right side of the boiler leaked water due to long-term disrepair and corrosion; the upper and lower joints of the water level gauge also had air leaks; the large valve on the boiler and the three small valves in the lower half also leaked air and water due to long-term disrepair. The head of the factory's trade union and the technicians responsible for burning the boiler have also made several suggestions to the factory to repair it, but the factory has delayed the suggestion, emphasizing that the factory can be relocated next year. As far as we know, on August 4, the boiler of Tianjin Private Yuyuan Rolling and Finishing Factory also exploded due to the above situation, killing one person and injuring ten others on the spot. This incident should attract the high attention of the person in charge of the knitting factory.
    In addition, most of the factory buildings are also dilapidated. The walls of the drying room and the boiler room have cracks, and the cracks in the left wall of the security department are as wide as two inches, leaking air everywhere, and no measures are taken to prevent it. We believe that this is a manifestation of ignoring the safety of workers' lives and should be corrected urgently.

### 天津市某些公私营工厂忽视安全卫生设备

    天津市某些公私营工厂
    忽视安全卫生设备
    （一）编辑同志：
    根据我们对天津市各公、私营工厂安全卫生工作的检查，发现有些厂的安全卫生工作搞得确实很好。但另外一些厂的负责人，却只是在口头上应付卫生机关的检查，而漠视我们对它们改善安全卫生工作的建议，结果影响了工人的生命安全和健康，这对生产也是一个很大的障碍。我认为，把这些情况告诉你们，以引起各地厂矿的注意是会有好处的。
    天津公营建华玻璃厂在今年五月，因为磨口机上的皮带没有安全设备而轧伤了工人的胳臂，迄今也不加添安全设备。用氟酸在玻璃器上刻划度数表是一项有毒的工作（氟酸是有毒的化学药物，腐蚀性很强，发出有毒气体，吸入后即发生鼻炎、喉炎、支气管炎，对皮肤则腐蚀、溃伤，慢性中毒可使肠胃障碍、神经障碍以致死），该厂工人有因吸入氟酸毒气而吐血的。这个工作间很狭小，空气阳光都不够充分，厂方对这种作业工人的健康及防护工作，简直是漠然无视，连口罩都不发给。按照预防的办法来说，这种工作间应该装置排气及换气的设备，工人须戴防毒面具、橡皮手套，穿橡皮鞋、工作服才能工作，而且工作时间也应缩短。
    另外，我们检查了天津大部分电池工厂，根据对四十四个工人的身体检查材料说明，有百分之八十以上的工人患铅中毒的症状。铅毒能使人的身体发生贫血、腹绞痛、两腕及两足下垂或麻痹等病，这种病在治疗上很少有办法，必须注意预防。但厂方负责人多不注意我们的建议，以为改善设备，发给工作服和口罩，是过分的要求；或者是强调经济困难，无法解决。像天津私营太平洋电池厂的负责人说：“我在工厂工作了十几年，也没有看见什么症状发生。这是毫无科学根据地否认铅中毒危险的说法。强调经济困难也是不对的。据我们了解私营公裕化学厂很赚钱，但该厂对工人健康和福利却一向忽视。如化合二硝基苯的工作室，应有完善的排气设备，但这个工作室却是尘埃满屋，因此使工人经常发生头痛、呕吐、心悸亢进、视力障碍等病状。该厂工人的洗澡间设备，及其他各种有关卫生设备都很恶劣。这种不顾工人死活的倾向，简直是不能容忍的。
    有些制革厂及骨胶厂对于环境卫生很不注意。像厨房、饭厅都没有防蝇的设备，以致在夏秋季节，患肠炎的很多。这些厂的负责人只是在盘算添加防蝇设备要花不少的钱，而看不到有了防蝇设备会减少工人疾病，节省医药费和减少病假，及工人因病就诊所耗费的许多时间。新中国造纸厂职工，在今年六月份发生肠炎和拉痢的病人竟达全厂总人数的百分之六十，几乎无法开工。后经添加防蝇设备，注意职工饮食卫生，在七月份时，就减少了四分之三的病人。这说明改善环境卫生，一方面是保障了工人的健康，一方面提高了出勤率，增加了生产。因此用于卫生工作的预防费，并不是无益的浪费，而是生产所必需的条件。我们一定要在思想上认识安全卫生工作的重要性，因为只有保护工人身体健康，才能增加生产效能作好经济建设工作。

    （二）编辑同志：
    天津市劳动局在八月底检查了工业局所属针织工厂，发现该厂锅炉因超过使用年限，随时有发生事故的危险。这件事虽经我们提请该厂采取有效措施，但至今并未引起厂方负责人的重视。
    据会同我们前往检查该厂安全设备的技工人员谈：该厂立式两节锅炉使用年限已超过十五年，全部安全设备均已失效。像测量锅炉本身是否超过气压负荷量的海压，因珐琅盘有裂缝漏气而失效。只好在海压垂上盲目地加上几块废铁片，继续使用，这样就失去了测量气压的作用；锅炉右侧的铆钉多因年久失修，腐蚀破裂而漏水；水面计的上下节门处也有漏气的情况；锅炉上的大节门及下半节的三个小节门也因长年不修而漏气漏水。该厂工会负责人及负责烧锅炉的技工，也曾经数度向厂方提出检修的建议，但厂方却强调明年可以迁厂而将这项建议拖延下来。据我们所知八月四日天津市私营裕元轧布整理工厂的锅炉也因上述情况而发生爆炸，当场死亡一人，伤十人。这件事应该引起针织工厂负责人的高度注意才好。
    另外，该厂厂房，也多破烂不堪，烘干室墙壁、锅炉房墙壁都有裂缝，保全部左方墙裂缝竟达两吋宽，四处漏风，也不设法防范。我们认为这是忽视工人生命安全的表现，亟应纠正。
