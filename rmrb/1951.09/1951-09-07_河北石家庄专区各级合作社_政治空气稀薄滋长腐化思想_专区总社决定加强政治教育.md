    Hebei Shijiazhuang Prefecture Cooperatives at All Levels
    Political Atmosphere Weak, Breeding Corrupt Ideas
    Prefecture General Cooperative Decides to Strengthen Political Education
    The General Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, conducted an in-depth inspection of the tendency to disregard politics. It was found that this tendency was serious among cadres of cooperatives at all levels throughout the prefecture, and had caused significant losses to the people's property and hindered the development of cooperative work in the prefecture. The General Cooperative of the Prefecture is now vigorously correcting this.
    The tendency to disregard politics is primarily manifested in cooperatives at all levels engaging in business blindly, detached from political guidance. They do not study work guidelines and policies, so their work fails to focus on key priorities and lacks principles. Some cooperatives engage in localism in their work, pitting the interests of the cooperative against the interests of the state. As a result, they have had poor relations with state-owned companies for a long time, always complaining that state-owned companies are not generous enough. Within the cooperative, upper and lower-level cooperatives also compete for profits, with upper-level cooperatives not wholeheartedly serving lower-level cooperatives, and lower-level cooperatives not trusting upper-level cooperatives. All of these have affected the development of cooperative work.
    Secondly, cadres generally tend to belittle political study. They mistakenly believe that they cannot work without understanding business, but they can work without studying politics. Many cadres are unaware of basic revolutionary common sense and current major political movements and events. For example, some cooperative cadres are unaware of the Korean armistice negotiations. As another example, the General Cooperative of the Prefecture held a political test on August 15th, with the participation of 50 main cadres (directors, head of the organization and guidance section, head of the planning section) from the cooperatives of various counties. The average score was only 44 points.
    Due to the above reasons, the political atmosphere in cooperatives at all levels is weak, causing many cadres to become politically numb, and even fostering corrupt and degenerate ideas. Incidents of embezzlement, waste, dereliction of duty, theft, fire, and moldy goods occur frequently in cooperatives at all levels, causing serious losses to the people's property. According to incomplete statistics from the first half of this year alone, there were 144 cases of embezzlement in cooperatives at all levels throughout the prefecture, with embezzled public funds amounting to more than 37.5 million yuan. There were 11 cases of goods being stolen and robbed, with losses amounting to more than 15 million yuan. There were 6 fires, with a total loss value of 1.62 million yuan. There were 11 cases of lost funds, totaling more than 2.68 million yuan. Other losses were valued at approximately 34 million yuan. Among them, Ding Zhengxin, the deputy director of the cotton ginning factory of the Zhengding County Cooperative, was politically numb and indifferent to his work. He spent his days eating, drinking, and gambling, and colluded with private merchants, embezzling 3.4 million yuan of public funds (already dealt with). These situations not only caused losses to the people's property, but also had a very bad political impact.
    In order to correct the tendency to disregard politics, the General Cooperative of the Prefecture has decided to: (1) Strengthen political education for cadres and members. In the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea, emphasize the consistency between the interests of the state and the current and long-term interests of the members. (2) Cooperatives at all levels should establish a regular work inspection system. Conduct a comprehensive and thorough inspection of patriotic compacts. (3) Establish propaganda institutions and strengthen propaganda work for cooperative members. A propaganda institution should be established within the Organization and Guidance Section of the General Cooperative of the Prefecture, with the deputy section chief responsible for propaganda work. The organization and guidance sections of each county cooperative should be equipped with strong deputy section chiefs or propaganda staff members to specifically take charge of propaganda and education work. (4) Conscientiously grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, strictly enforce economic discipline, ensure that rewards and punishments are clear, and resolutely fight against corruption and waste. Establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and promote the development of the cooperative cause.

### 河北石家庄专区各级合作社  政治空气稀薄滋长腐化思想  专区总社决定加强政治教育

    河北石家庄专区各级合作社
    政治空气稀薄滋长腐化思想
    专区总社决定加强政治教育
    河北省石家庄专区供销合作总社深入检查了不问政治的倾向。发现这种倾向在全专区各级合作社干部中都严重地存在着，并已使人民的财产受到了很大损失，阻碍了专区合作社工作的发展。现专区合作总社已大力进行纠正。
    不问政治的倾向，首先表现在各级合作社脱离政治指导而盲目搞业务。他们不研究工作方针和政策，因此工作抓不住重心，缺乏原则性。有的合作社在工作中闹本位主义，把合作社利益和国家利益对立起来，因此很长时间跟国营公司的关系搞不好，总嫌国营公司优待太少。在合作社内部，上下级合作社也互相争利润，上级合作社不能专心为下级合作社服务，下级合作社不信任上级合作社。这些都影响了合作社工作的发展。
    其次，干部们普遍有着轻视政治学习的倾向。他们错误地认为不懂业务就不能工作，不学习政治一样可以工作。有许多干部对于革命基本常识和当前重大政治运动、政治事件都不知道。如有的合作社干部连朝鲜停战谈判都不知道。又如八月十五日专区合作总社举行了一次政治测验，参加测验的有各县合作社主要干部（主任、组导科长、计划科长）等五十人，平均每人只得四十四分。
    由于以上原因，各级合作社中政治空气稀薄，造成许多干部政治上麻痹，甚至滋长了腐化堕落思想。各级合作社中贪污、浪费、失职、偷盗、失火、霉烂货物等事件不断发生，使人民资财受到严重损失。仅据今年上半年的不完全统计，全专区各级合作社发生贪污事件一百四十四次，贪污公款达三千七百五十余万元。货物失盗被劫十一次，损失折款一千五百余万元。失火六次，损失总值一百六十二万元。丢款十一次，共二百六十八万余元。其他损失约值三千四百余万元。其中如正定县社轧花厂副厂长丁正信，政治上麻痹，对工作不闻不问，终日吃、喝、聚赌，并拉拢私商，贪污公款三百四十万元（已处理）。这些情况，不但造成人民财产的损失，并且政治影响也很坏。
    为了纠正不问政治的倾向，专区合作总社决定：（一）加强对干部和社员的政治教育。在抗美援朝爱国主义教育中，着重贯彻国家利益与社员当前及长远利益的一致性。（二）各级合作社应树立定期的工作检查制度。普遍彻底地检查一次爱国公约。（三）建立宣传机构，加强对社员群众的宣传工作。专区合作总社组导科内应建立宣传机构，由副科长负责宣传工作。各县社组导科要配备强有力的副科长或宣传科员，专门掌握宣传教育工作。（四）认真掌握批评与自我批评的武器，严格执行经济纪律，做到赏罚严明，坚决向贪污浪费作斗争。树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，推进合作事业的发展。
