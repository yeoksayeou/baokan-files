Model Laborers in Huai River Project, Special Class Merit Winners Gan Caihua and Chen Mingying Report Resolve to Chairman Mao

We had a good wheat harvest this year, and life is getting better and better. Respected Chairman Mao:

I am a rural woman living by the Huai River. After the Kuomintang reactionaries breached the Yellow River dike in 1938, our village's crops were flooded every year for thirteen years. We never expected an autumn harvest, and the summer harvest was only two or three tenths of what it should have been. Every year when the floodwaters rose, my family of six would set up a broken boat in the Fei River to fish (the Fei River is a tributary of the Huai River). We would get in the boat before dawn every day and work until dark just to barely feed the family. Many other villagers couldn't survive at home and had to flee the famine, some of them starving to death outside. Chairman Mao, we suffered too many disasters in the past, and it would take three days and three nights to tell you about them all.

Last year, you resolved to thoroughly harness the Huai River, and I was so happy I couldn't speak. I thought about it for several days, and I felt that the Communist Party was truly our savior. After that, I left my children and joined the others to build the dike. On the Huai dike, I often thought of the suffering I had endured in the past, and I worked hard without fear of any difficulties. By the end of the winter project, everyone rated me as a Special Class Merit Winner. Government leaders and villagers all respected me, calling me a "Hero of the People." Chairman Mao: All this glory was given to me by you and the Communist Party! From now on, I will definitely produce well and always maintain this honor.

This summer, after returning home from the Huai dike, I was busy harvesting wheat and weeding soybeans. The government also lent our village more than thirty head of yellow cattle. This year was the first time we had a good wheat harvest, and life is really getting better and better. Now, the people in our village no longer have the bitter faces they used to have; everyone is working hard and happily. My village is close to the Fei River, and this river was not harnessed in time this year, so the autumn crops were flooded again. But it doesn't matter, we are not as worried as we used to be. First, because only a small area was flooded; second, because the government had prepared fishing loans for us as soon as the water rose. Now a fishermen's association has been established in our village, and everyone has elected me as the director. Everyone is repairing nets and boats, and we will start fishing soon. There are no major difficulties in life. At the same time, we all know that we will continue to harness the river in the future and eliminate disasters completely.

Because I became a Special Class Merit Winner, the villagers in the village value me very much, and they come to me to discuss everything. For example, how to educate the militia, how to formulate the patriotic pact, etc. The teachers of the people's school also write to me to discuss how to run the school well. I often think in my heart: "When the Huai River is harnessed, everyone's life will get better day by day. I must do a good job so that everyone can live a better life." Chairman Mao: I assure you that I will work harder in the future, I must repair the Huai River well, I must live a better life, and I must always be glorious.

I wish you good health!

Respected Chairman Mao:

I have wanted to write to you for a long time. Now I will report our living conditions to you.

Last year when the big flood occurred, the government sent people to comfort us and immediately distributed wheat and rice, saving our lives; later, they distributed seeds of potatoes, carrots, cabbage, buckwheat, rapeseed, etc., so that each of our families could plant two or three mu of vegetable fields. In order to eliminate the flood, you called on us to thoroughly harness the Huai River. The people in the village were really extremely happy when they heard this. Men and women with labor power responded to the call and went to the dike. Women and old people without labor power were also led by the government to produce mats in the rear. In this way, although the crops failed last year due to the flood, we were all able to maintain our lives. The people in our village all said: "We have never seen such a good government in thousands of years; the Communist Party and Chairman Mao treat the people even better than their own parents!"

In the first month of this year, the spring repair project of the Huai River began. Thinking of the past when the Kuomintang reactionaries harnessed the Huai River, we didn't know how many beatings we suffered, how much money we spent, and how much suffering we endured, but in the end we still didn't harness the Huai River well. Now, Chairman Mao is leading us to harness the Huai River. We all realize that harnessing the Huai River is for ourselves and our children and grandchildren to no longer suffer. So we are determined to harness the Huai River well. On the dike, we launched a red flag competition. Every morning, as soon as we heard the loudspeaker shout "Get up, go to the construction site!" we hurriedly got up, and without even washing our faces, we ran to the dike to carry soil.

In the first year that the Huai dike was repaired, we had a good harvest. Although the wheat in the low-lying areas was planted later, the wheat grains were still very full. The wheat in the high-lying areas all had a full harvest. Sorghum also had a harvest of one dan per mu. Now it is almost the autumn harvest, and it looks like soybeans will also have a full harvest. Everyone says that if it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to harness the Huai River, and the government lending us ploughing cattle, cattle grass, seeds, etc., we would not have been able to eat wheat this year!

Now many families in our village have signed patriotic covenants. My family has also signed one. We have decided to increase production and donate 100,000 yuan to buy airplanes and cannons; my sister-in-law also donated a pair of shoes to the volunteers to wear and fight the American devils.

There are six families of military dependents in our village. We think of their children or husbands fighting on the front lines to protect our peaceful life, so every time we harvest crops, we harvest them for them first. We must take good care of them.

Respected Chairman Mao, I often think that I am not only a hero of the Huai River project, but also a propaganda officer of the Party. I guarantee that I will do a good job in propaganda work in the future, lead the masses to do a good job in production, and publicize and explain the various policies of the government to the masses. Now our township is about to implement land reform, and I must stand firm, mobilize the masses, overthrow the landlords, and work hard to do a good job in production.

I wish you good health!

    治淮特等功臣甘彩华、陈明英
    向毛主席报告治淮决心
    今年收了好麦子，日子越过越有劲。敬爱的毛主席：
    俺是一个农村妇女，家住在淮河边上。一九三八年国民党反动派掘开黄河堤后，十三年来，俺村的庄稼年年被淹，秋收从来没指望，夏收也仅只能见到两、三成。每年大水上涨，俺们一家大小六口人就架起一只破船到淝河里捕鱼（淝河是淮河支流）。每天天不亮就下船，一直忙到天黑，才能勉强糊住一家人的口。还有很多乡亲们在家里没法过，就出去逃荒，有的就饿死在外面。毛主席，俺们过去受的灾害是太多了，说起来三天三夜也说不完。
    去年您下定决心根治淮河，俺听到心里高兴得说不出话来。俺闷着头想了好几天，觉得共产党真是俺们的救命恩人。以后，俺就放下孩子跟着大伙一块去修堤。在淮堤上，俺常常想起以前受的苦来，就啥困难也不怕地下劲干。到冬修工程结束，大家把俺评做特等功臣。政府首长和乡亲们都尊敬俺，说俺是“人民的功臣”。毛主席：这光荣都是您和共产党给俺的呀！从今后俺一定要好好生产，要永远保持光荣。
    今年夏天，俺从淮堤上回家后，就忙着割麦子，锄黄豆。政府又贷给俺村三十多头黄牛。今年第一次收了好麦子，日子真是越过越有劲。现在俺村的人再没有像以前整天皱着眉头的苦相了，大家都是嘻嘻哈哈地努力生产。俺这个村紧靠着淝河，这条河今年没来得及治，因此秋庄稼又淹了。可是不要紧，俺们也不像从前那样的发愁了。一来因为淹的只是一小片；二来因为水刚刚上来，政府就给俺们预备好了渔贷款。现在俺村上已成立了渔民协会，大家选俺当了主任，都正在补网、修船，马上就要开始打鱼了。生活是没啥困难的。同时俺们都知道今后还要继续治河，很快就会澈底消灭灾害。
    因为俺当了特等功臣，村子上的乡亲们都很看重俺，有啥事都来和俺商量。譬如说民兵怎么教育呀，爱国公约怎样订呀等等。民校老师也来信给俺商量怎样办好学校。俺心里也常常这样想：“淮河治好，大家日子就一天天好过了，俺一定要干好工作，让大家把日子过得更好。”毛主席：俺向您保证，今后俺更要加油干，一定要把淮河修好，一定要把日子过的更好，一定要永远光荣下去。
    祝您身体健康！
    蚌埠市小蚌埠区太平岗乡八大集村治淮特等功臣甘彩华敬上（冯昕代笔）敬爱的毛主席：
    我老早就想写信给您。现在我把我们的生活情形报告给您。
    去年发大水时，政府派人来慰问我们，又立即发放麦子、稻子，救活了我们的性命；往后又发给我们土豆子（马铃薯）、胡萝卜、菜子、荞麦、油菜等种子，因而我们每家都能种上二、三亩菜地。为了消灭水灾，您号召我们根治淮河。村里的人听了真是高兴极了，有劳动力的男女都响应号召上了堤，没有劳动力的妇女和老年人也由政府领导着在后方打席子生产。这样，去年虽因大水，庄稼没收成，但我们都能维持生活。我们村里的人都说：“几千年来也没见过这样好的政府；共产党、毛主席对待人民真比亲生的父母还亲！”
    今年正月里，治淮春修工程开工了。想起过去国民党反动派治淮河，我们不知挨了多少打，花了多少钱，受了多少苦，结果还是没把淮河治好。现在，毛主席领导我们治淮，我们都认识到治好淮河是为了我们自己和子子孙孙不再受苦，所以下决心要把淮河治好。在堤上，我们开展了红旗竞赛运动。每天一清早，只要一听到广播筒喊“起来了，上工地了！”我们就都连忙爬起来，连脸也顾不得洗，就奔上堤去抬土了。
    淮堤修好的头一年，我们就得了好年成。洼地的麦子，虽然种得晚些，可是麦粒子还是长得很饱满。高地的麦子都是十成收。秫秫也都是每亩成担的收。现在快到秋收了，眼看黄豆又是十成年景。大家都说，要不是毛主席领导我们治淮，政府又贷给耕牛、牛草、种子等等，我们今年休想吃上麦子啊！
    现在我们村里很多人家都订了爱国公约。我家也订了，我们决定增加生产捐献十万元买飞机大炮；我弟媳妇还捐出一双鞋子，送给志愿军穿，好打美国鬼子。
    我们村里有六家军属，我们想到他们的孩子或丈夫在前方打仗，保住我们过太平日子，所以我们每次收庄稼的时节，都是先给他们收。我们一定要好好照顾他们。
    敬爱的毛主席，我时常想，自己不但是治淮功臣，还是党的宣传员，我保证今后一定要做好宣传工作，领导群众搞好生产，向群众宣传和解释政府的各项政策。现在，我们乡快实行土地改革了，我一定站稳立场，发动群众，打倒地主，努力搞好生产。
    祝您身体健康！蚌埠市小蚌埠镇丁家岗治淮特等功臣陈明英（朱宝模代笔）（附图片）
