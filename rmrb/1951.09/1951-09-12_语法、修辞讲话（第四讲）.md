Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 4)

    Fourth Section: Attributive Modifiers

    Long Attributive Modifiers. This section will mainly discuss the attributive modifiers of nouns. When this is mentioned, the most headache-inducing problem is those extremely long attributive modifiers. Are these long attributive modifiers necessary? Let's look at some examples.

    (1) At the same time, it also has the common shortcomings of general new comic strips: few panels, weak coherence, and prone to becoming illustrative; it lacks the characteristic of old comic strips that meticulously depict the specific process of scenes and character actions and closely connects them, enabling people with limited literacy to understand the outline and progress of the story without completely relying on words. (Newspaper)

    (2) In terms of work methods, there is a phenomenon: a few cadres are very busy, but they do not know how to unite and cultivate the active elements around them, only being busy themselves, and sometimes only the secretary is busy. (Periodical)

    (3) During the October competition, the fifth fine yarn group generally lacked confidence, holding the attitude that they would do whatever others did, regardless of competition or no competition. (Manuscript)

    (4) Correct the ideas that currently mainly focus on doing a good job in land reform, women's work can be done or not, mobilizing women is the business of women cadres, male cadres are inconvenient to do women's work, or believe that women are "backward, troublesome, and nagging," and are difficult to mobilize, as well as the ideas of women cadres who are unwilling to do women's work and hope to do other work. (Periodical)

    (5) In the process of popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, North China has used methods such as broadcast rallies, window displays, propaganda in cultural centers and people's schools, and designated cadres to implement a "contract system" by department and person, carrying out propaganda street by street, alley by alley, block by block, and household by household, which has been welcomed by the people, proving that this is a better method to make propaganda popular and in-depth. (Newspaper)

    (6) "The suggestion box was just a decoration in the reactionary period," this is the heartfelt expression of Liu Jinian, a resident of Guandimiao Street, after his problem was submitted to the cultural center's mailbox and a cadre came to his home to answer it seven hours later. (Periodical)

    (7) Regarding the situation of ethnic minority women in Guizhou Province, we heard a report given by Comrade Xiong Yunzhu of the Guizhou Provincial Women's Federation Preparatory Committee at a get-together hosted by the Guizhou Provincial Women's Federation Preparatory Committee and the Guiyang Municipal Women's Federation Preparatory Committee, with representatives of ethnic minority women, intellectuals, and cadres participating. (Periodical)

There are seven sentences here, all with fairly long attributive modifiers. Is it necessary to be like this? Is there a way to avoid it? Example (1) gives us a hint. Its first half uses the form of apposition instead of the form of attributive modifier, then the second half can also be changed to "lacks the characteristic of old comic strips, depicting the scene...progress". Similarly, (2) can be changed to "There is a very bad phenomenon: a few cadres..."; (3) can be changed to "holding this attitude: whatever others do..."; (4) can be changed to "Correct those wrong ideas: such as thinking that currently... or thinking that mobilizing women... or thinking that women... even women cadres are unwilling..."; (5) can be changed to "have used various methods, such as broadcast rallies...etc.". (6) is more troublesome to change, but if it is changed to "Suggestion boxes are also handled very well. Liu Jinian, a resident of Guandimiao Street... got a cadre to his home to answer it, he said with emotion, 'Suggestion boxes were just decorations in the reactionary period'," it is no worse than the original sentence, maybe even better. (The original sentence is the beginning of a paragraph. This kind of flashback is common in novels, but not suitable for general factual reporting.) (7) is different. If "Regarding..." retains its position at the beginning of the sentence, there is no way to change it. If it is changed to "Guizhou... held a get-together to entertain us, with... participating, at the meeting Comrade Xiong Yunzhu of the Provincial Women's Federation gave us a report on the situation of ethnic minority women in Guizhou Province," the long attributive modifier is avoided, but the position of "Regarding..." is moved, and it does not connect with the previous text.

    From this, it seems that most long attributive modifiers can be avoided. But some people will say that after such revisions, it is not as compact as the original. This statement has considerable reason, but we cannot blindly pursue compactness, which can become clumsy if done improperly; in contrast to this, it is not necessarily loose, it may also be light and lively. Please see the following two sentences:

    (8) What kind of theorists do we want? We want theorists who can, based on the position, viewpoint, and method of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, correctly interpret the practical problems that occur in history and in the revolution, who can give scientific explanations and theoretical explanations on various issues of China's economy, politics, military, and culture, we want such theorists. (Mao)

    (9) What kind of theorists do we want? We want theorists who are able, based on the position, viewpoint, and method of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, to correctly interpret the practical problems that occur in history and in the revolution, to give scientific explanations and theoretical explanations on various issues of China's economy, politics, military, and culture.

    Which sentence is good and which sentence is bad is very obvious. Although (9) has twelve fewer words than (8), it is much more difficult to read. In (8), from "want" to the end of the sentence, there are five places where you can pause, but (9) has to read seventy-six words in one breath without rest. You naturally have to breathe in the middle, but psychologically you are not allowed to pause, which makes the reader feel tense and makes him easily tired. A person who knows how to write needs to make the reader tense when he needs the reader to be tense, and never abuses this weapon when he doesn't need him to be tense. Judging by this standard, of the previous seven sentences, only (3) may have a reason to maintain its original appearance. (7) is forced to do so and cannot adopt another way of saying it. The remaining long attributive modifiers should be avoided and can be avoided.

    Not suitable to take the form of attributive modifiers. The attributive modifiers in the following sentences are not long, but we feel that they are forced to be placed there.

    (10) Proved the truth that American imperialism and all imperialism are paper tigers. (Periodical)

    (11) Some cadres first propose preliminary opinions on which people are in a class, and then the masses discuss. (Manuscript)

    (12) Point out to the bandits that there are only two roads: surrender or death. (Periodical)

    (13) With the improvement of business, the Workers' Preparation Committee will work with the capitalists to start adjusting the unreasonable phenomenon of high wages for staff and low wages for workers in the past. (Manuscript)

    The attributive modifiers in the first three sentences are all sentence forms, and the content is equal to the modified word, which is suitable for taking the form of apposition (see Section 5 of the first lecture). (10) can be changed to "proved...this truth" or "proved a truth...". (Also, all imperialism includes American imperialism, so the word "and" cannot be used to connect them, "or even" should be used.) (11) can be changed to "propose preliminary opinions, which people are in a class". (12) is best to delete "two roads", or change it to "only two roads: surrender and death". (13) It is correct to use "high wages for staff and low wages for workers" as the attributive modifier of "phenomenon", but it is wrong to use "...phenomenon" as the attributive modifier of "wages", it should be changed to "adjust wages, eliminate the past...phenomenon". The attributive modifier and the modified word are not properly matched. The following two sentences put the attributive modifier in the wrong place.

    (14) Extensive opinions were exchanged on wage issues at this conference. (Periodical)

    (15) Can it be said that he is a sketch of a real person? There is no one in the world with a character as complete as Ah Q. (Education)

    (14) The opinions are not extensive, but the scope of exchange is extensive, it should be changed to "exchanged opinions extensively". (15) How can Ah Q's character be considered complete? The author means "a person with a character as completely like Ah Q's". The following two sentences cannot be said to be in the wrong place, but the way they are now will have interpretations that do not conform to the author's original intention.

    (16) The cool and rapid Kuban River bank. (Periodical)

    (17) For those disputes between old couples who may reconcile, it is not a simple matter of breaking them up. (Newspaper)

    (16) "Cool and rapid" describes "river", but "river bank" has become a compound word, and it is not appropriate to use "cool and rapid" to describe it. It should be changed to "the bank of the cool and rapid Kuban River". (17) "May reconcile" can only describe "couples" in meaning, but the structure of this sentence makes it only describe "marital relationship" or "disputes", which are both incomprehensible. This sentence also has a problem that is "break up...disputes", "disputes" cannot be broken up, and only "couples" can be broken up. This sentence should be changed to "For those couples who are still likely to reconcile even though they are having disputes, it should not be a simple matter of breaking them up". The following sentence is an example that does not make sense in meaning.

    (18) This form is not suitable for reading by farmers with many illiterate people at present. (Newspaper)

    It makes sense that there are many illiterate people among farmers, but "farmers with many illiterate people" is a bit puzzling, and it is even more difficult to understand whether it is suitable or unsuitable for "farmers with many illiterate people" to read. Of course, there is no reading material that is suitable for this reader who is neither illiterate nor non-illiterate, but only has "many illiterate people". Presumably, the author means "not suitable for reading by farmers with limited literacy".

    Attributive modifiers such as pronouns. Pronouns, names of people, names of places, and similar nouns that are "unique" in meaning generally cannot have attributive modifiers. Now there are imitations of foreign grammar using attributive modifiers, some of which are indeed needed, and some are unnecessary. Examples of pronouns with attributive modifiers:

    (19) How happy are the people of New China, especially those in the capital. (Work)

    (20) The forty-meter-high cliff on the palm of the hand suddenly flew down, in the heat and ash, the two heroic men finally failed to rush out and suffered disaster. (Book)

    This is very awkward and completely unnecessary. (19) should be changed to "especially the people of the capital", (20) should be changed to "these two heroic workers". Examples of names and similar nouns with attributive modifiers:

    (21) Dr. Liu Renlin, who participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea volunteer medical team organized by the Shanghai medical community, is about to depart, and his wife, Dr. Huang Zhujin, came to see him off with their children. (Periodical)

    (22) The Chinese people who love peace and continue to deepen and popularize the great struggle of Resist America, Aid Korea in order to defend world peace and respond to the resolution of the World Peace Council, resolutely protest against this brutal and reactionary measure of the French government. (Newspaper)

    If the attributive modifiers in these two sentences are changed to be part of the predicate ("Dr. Liu Renlin participated in... and is about to depart", "The Chinese people love peace... and resolutely protest"), it will not show that these are only secondary meanings. Therefore, the form of attributive modifier must be adopted. Although this form is still a bit unfamiliar now, it will slowly become popular. There are also cases of adding attributive modifiers before time words, such as:

    (23) In China's history, which has already experienced more important changes than the past few hundred or even thousands of years, the old-faced China is rapidly disappearing, and the new people's China has definitely grown up today... (Periodical)

    (24) Liu Lifu's year with such brilliant achievements can explain this problem. (Periodical)

    This is also unnecessary, especially (24), only saying "one year", without telling people what happened in that year. (23) can be changed to "Today, China's history...". (24) should be changed to "Liu Lifu's brilliant achievements in the past year".

    Put it in front or put it in the back? Some attributive modifiers are not long, but writers put them in the back in order to make the sentences flow better (this is not an ordinary attributive modifier, but a clause without a subject or with the subject omitted). For example:

    (25) Many struggles, including the nationwide movement like the Revolution of 1911, have failed. (Mao)

    (26) Another advantage of the old novels, which is related to the previous advantage, is the exquisite shaping of typical characters. (Periodical)

    (27) We have fought against the opportunistic tendencies within the party, both right and left. (Mao)

    (28) Not long ago, he also made me such a carriage, you can't buy it even if you go to Mexico. (Lu, translated)

    The following example can be put in the back but is put in the front:

    (29) People from all over Britain have pre-ordered 250,000 forms from the British and Peace Committee that can be signed by five million people. (Newspaper)

    The original sentence is not bad, but if it is changed to "pre-ordered 250,000 forms that can be signed by five million people", it seems better. The following two examples should be put in the front but are put in the back:

    (30) In less than ten days, nearly thirty tons of copper were checked. (Periodical)

    (31) Minerals, coal, oil, salt, and stone will all flow in large quantities from the earth's crust to the automated factories, where they will be turned into various things that people must have. (Periodical)

    (30) should say "nearly thirty tons of copper". (31) should say "various things that people need".

    语法、修辞讲话（第四讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第四段  附加语
    长附加语。这一段要讨论的以名词的附加语为主。一提到这个，大家最感觉头痛的问题就是那些长得要命的附加语。这种长附加语是不是有必要呢？让我们找些实例来看看。
    （一）同时也具有一般新连环画共同的缺点，画幅少，连贯性不强，流于插图式；没有旧连环画那种把场面、人物行动的具体过程作细致的描写和密切的连系，使识字不多的人不必完全依靠文字就能够理解故事的轮廓和进程的特征。（报）
    （二）在工作方法上，存在着少数干部忙得很，而不会团结和培养周围的积极分子，只是自己忙，甚至有时只是书记一个人忙的现象。（期）
    （三）在十月份竞赛时，细纱第五小组普遍没有信心，都抱着别人怎么干自己就怎么干就是了，不管什么竞赛不竞赛的态度。（稿）
    （四）纠正那些目前主要是搞好土地改革，妇女工作可做可不做，发动妇女是妇女干部的事，男干部不便做妇女工作，或认为妇女“落后、麻烦、囉嗦”，不好发动，以及妇女干部不愿做妇女工作而希望做其他工作等思想。（期）
    （五）华北各地在普及抗美援朝运动中已经使用了广播大会，橱窗宣传，在文化馆民校中进行宣传，以及指定干部按处按人实行“包干制”，逐街，逐巷，逐片，逐户地进行宣传等办法，受到人民欢迎，证明这是使宣传普及深入的较好方法。（报）
    （六）“意见箱在反动派时期只是点缀品，”这是关帝庙街住户刘纪年把问题投入文化馆信箱七小时后就得到干部到家解答时的不胜感慨的表示。（期）
    （七）关于贵州省少数民族妇女的情况，我们在贵州省妇联筹备会及贵阳市妇联筹备会招待我们，并有少数民族妇女代表，知识分子、干部参加的联欢会上，听到省妇联熊蕴竹同志给我们作的报告。（期）这里共有七句，都是有相当长的附加语的。是不是非如此不可呢？有没有法子避免呢？例（一）就给了我们一个启示。它的上半句不用附加语的形式而用同位语的形式，那末下半句也可以改成“没有旧连环画的特征，把场面……进程”。同样，（二）可以改为“存在着一种很不好的现象：少数干部……”；（三）可以改为“抱着这么个态度：别人怎么干……”；（四）可以改为“纠正那些错误的思想：如认为目前……，或是认为发动妇女……，或是认为妇女……，甚至妇女干部也不愿……”；（五）可以改为“已经使用了各种方法，如广播大会……等”。（六）改起来比较费事，但是如果改做“意见箱也办理得很好。关帝庙街住户刘纪年……就得到干部到家解答，他不胜感慨地说，‘意见箱在反动派时期只是点缀品’，”也不比原句坏，也许还好些。（原句是一段的起头，这种倒叙法在小说里常见，在一般实事求是的报导里并不相宜。）（七）就不同了。如果给“关于……”保留句子头上的位置，就没有法子改。如果改做“贵州……开了个联欢会招待我们，有……参加，在会上省妇联熊蕴竹同志给我们做了关于贵州省少数民族妇女情况的报告”，长附加语是避免了，但是“关于……”的位置移动了，跟上文不接气了。
    这样看来，大多数长附加语是可以避免的。但是有人会说，这样修改之后，不及原来紧凑。这个话有相当理由，可是我们不能一味地追求紧凑，弄得不巧就会成为笨重；跟这个相对的，也不一定就是松散，也可能是轻快。请看下面这两句：
    （八）我们所要的理论家是什么理论家呢？是要这样的理论家，他们能够依据马恩列斯的立场、观点、方法，正确地解释历史中与革命中所发生的实际问题，能够在中国经济、政治、军事、文化种种问题上给予科学的解释，给予理论的说明，我们要的是这样的理论家。（毛）
    （九）我们所要的理论家是什么理论家呢？我们要的是能够依据马恩列斯的立场、观点、方法，正确地解释历史中与革命中所发生的实际问题，能够在中国经济、政治、军事、文化种种问题上给予科学的解释，给予理论的说明的理论家。这两句哪一句好，哪一句坏，非常明显。（九）虽然比（八）少十二个字，可是念起来吃力得多。（八）从“是要”起到句子完，中间有五个地方可以停顿，但是（九）就非一口气把七十六个字念完不得休息。当中自然不得不换气，但是心理上是不得停顿的，这就使读者感觉紧张，使他容易疲倦。会写文章的人，需要读者紧张的时候就叫他紧张，不需要他紧张的时候决不滥用这个武器。拿这个标准来看，前面七句里面只有（三）也许有理由维持原来的样子。（七）是实逼处此，不能采取别种说法。其余的长附加语都是应该避免而且可以避免的。
    不宜采取附加语的形式。底下这些句子里的附加语并不长，但是我们觉得放在那里很勉强。
    （十）证明了美帝国主义和一切帝国主义都是纸老虎的真理。（期）
    （十一）有的是干部先提出哪些人是一班的初步意见，再由群众讨论。（稿）
    （十二）向匪众指出不投降就只有死亡的两条道路。（期）
    （十三）随着业务的好转，工筹会即会同资方着手调整过去职员高工人低的不合理现象的工资。（稿）前三句的附加语都是句子形式，内容和被附加语相等，这是宜于采取同位语的形式的（见第一讲第五段）。（十）可以改做“证明了……这个真理”或“证明了一个真理……”。（又，一切帝国主义包括美帝国主义在内，不能用“和”字连接，该用“乃至”。）（十一）改做“提出初步意见，哪些人是一班”。（十二）最好是删去“的两条道路”，或是改做“只有投降和死亡两条路”。（十三）用“职员高工人低”做“现象”的附加语是对的，但是又用“……的现象”去做“工资”的附加语就不对了，应该改做“调整工资，消灭过去……现象”。附加语和被附加语配合不当。下面这两句把附加语放错了地方。
    （十四）这次大会上对工资问题交换了广泛的意见。（期）
    （十五）能说他是某个实在人物的写生么？在世界上没有一个像阿Q这样完全的性格的人。（教）（十四）意见并不广泛而是交换的范围广泛，应该改做“广泛地交换了意见”。（十五）阿Q的性格怎么能算完全？作者的意思是“完全像阿Q这样性格的人”。下面的两句不能说是位置不对，但是照现在的样子是要有不合于作者本意的解释的。
    （十六）清凉而急速的库班尼克河畔。（期）
    （十七）对那些可能和好的旧夫妻关系间的纠纷，也不是简单的拆散了事。（报）（十六）“清凉而急速”是形容“河”的，但是“河畔”已经成了个复合词，用“清凉而急速”去形容它，就不合适了。应该改做“清凉而急速的库班尼克河的岸边”。（十七）“可能和好”在意义上只能形容“夫妻”，但是这句的结构使它只能形容“夫妻关系”或“纠纷”，而这都是讲不通的。这句还有一个毛病是“拆散……纠纷”，“纠纷”是不能拆散的，能拆散的也只有“夫妻”。这句应该改做“对于那些虽然闹着纠纷而仍然可能和好的夫妻，也不该简单地拆散了事”。下面这句是意义上讲不通的例子。
    （十八）这种形式在目前是不适合于文盲多的农民阅读的。（报）农民里头文盲多，是讲得通的，“文盲多的农民”就有点费解了，适合或不适合于“文盲多的农民”阅读，就更不好懂了。当然没有一种读物是适合这个既不是文盲、也不是非文盲、而只是“文盲多”的读者的。大约作者的意思是“不适合于识字不多的农民阅读”。
    代词之类的附加语。代词、人名、地名以及同类的意义上是“有一无二”的名词，一般是不能有附加语的。现在有模仿外国语法用附加语的，有些是确有需要，有些没有必要。代词加附加语的例子：
    （十九）新中国的人民是多么高兴啊，尤其是首都的他们。（作）
    （二十）掌子上的四十米高的崖头突然飞卷下来，在热火灰沙中，英勇的他俩终于未得冲出而遭难。（书）这是非常别扭的，完全没有必要。（十九）应该改做“尤其是首都的人民”，（二十）应该改做“这两位英勇的工人”。人名和类似人名的名词加附加语的例子：
    （二一）参加上海医药界所组织的抗美援朝志愿医疗队的刘仁麟医师正要出发，他的妻子黄祝妗女医师带着孩子前来欢送。（期）
    （二二）热爱和平，并为保卫世界和平、响应世界和平理事会决议而继续深入普及抗美援朝伟大斗争的中国人民，坚决抗议法国政府这一横暴的反动的措施。（报）这两句的附加语如果改做谓语的一部分（“刘仁麟医师参加了……，正要出发”，“中国人民热爱和平……，坚决抗议”），就不能显出这些只是次要的意思。所以必须采取附加语的形式。这个形式虽然现在还有点不习惯，慢慢地会行开来的。另外有在时间词前面加附加语的，如：
    （二三）在中国的历史已经比过去几百年甚至几千年经历了更重要的变化，旧面貌的中国正在迅速地消失，新的人民的中国已经确定地生长起来了的今天……（期）
    （二四）有着这样光辉成绩的刘立富的一年就可以说明这个问题。（期）这又是不必要的，尤其是（二四），光说“一年”，不告诉人一年的什么。（二三）可以改做“在今天，中国的历史……”。（二四）应该改做“刘立富这一年来的光辉成绩”。
    放在前面还是放在后面？有些附加语并不长，但是作家们为了要使句子更流畅，就不把它放在前面，而把它放在后面（这就不是普通的附加语，而是无主语或省去主语的分句）。例如：
    （二五）多次奋斗，包括辛亥革命那样全国规模的运动，都失败了。（毛）
    （二六）旧小说的另一优点，和前一优点有连带关系的，是典型人物塑造的精妙。（期）
    （二七）我们曾和党内的机会主义倾向作斗争，右的和左的。（毛）
    （二八）不久以前，他还给我做一辆这样的马车，您就是到墨斯哥去也买不出。（鲁，译文）底下这个例子是可以放在后面而放在前面的：
    （二九）英国各地人民向英和委会预定了可供五百万人签名的二十五万份表格。（报）原句也不坏，但是如果改做“预定了二十五万份表格，可供五百万人签名”，似乎更好。底下这两个例子是应该放在前面而放在后面的：
    （三十）不到十天的工夫，就检了铜近三十吨。（期）
    （三一）矿石、煤、油、盐和石都会得大量地从地壳层流向自动工厂里去，在那边变成了各种东西，为人们所必须有的。（期）（三十）应该说“近三十吨的铜”。（三一）应该说“为人们所必需的各种东西”。
    （本段完，全文未完）
