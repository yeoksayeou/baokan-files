Liaoning Province Delays Handling of Burned State-Owned Planted Forest Incident
Some Counties Still Do Not Pay Attention to Forest Protection and Fire Prevention Work

Liaoning Province has not paid attention to inspecting and handling the serious incident of burned state-owned planted forests, causing some counties in the province to disregard forest protection and fire prevention work, leaving the few existing state-owned planted forests unprotected. This spring, Hailong, Huinan, and Qingyuan counties in the province burned down over 70,000 ten to fifteen-year-old larch and black pine trees in state-owned planted forests. The Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry attached great importance to this incident and, at the meeting of the heads of provincial forestry administrations on June 13, instructed Liaoning Province to investigate responsibility. At the same time, the staff of the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry who came to Liaoning to hold a meeting also raised this issue. On August 8, the Forestry Administration Bureau of the Northeast People's Government again sent a letter to the Forestry Administration Office of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, ordering it to report the incident of burned state-owned planted forests in Hailong and other counties to the Provincial Supervisory Committee for handling, but this matter has not yet been dealt with. This has had a negative impact on the forest protection and fire prevention work in some major counties in the province that cultivate state-owned planted forests. The Northeast People's Government's "Instructions on Forest Protection and Fire Prevention Work," promulgated on July 23, clearly pointed out: "The county head of each key afforestation county in forest areas and semi-forest areas shall convene local public security, armed forces, military departments, and forest industry bureau, railway bureau, industrial and mining departments to organize a forest protection and fire prevention committee to unifiedly lead forest protection and fire prevention work," but Fengcheng County had not yet started to establish a forest protection and fire prevention committee as of August 20. According to Lv, the chief of the county's forestry administration section, County Head Wang Yan of the county does not pay attention to forest protection and fire prevention work and does not agree to the establishment of a forest protection and fire prevention committee. At the joint meeting of district heads in the county, County Head Wang Yan only allowed three minutes of discussion on the issue of organizing a forest protection and fire prevention committee, making it impossible to deploy and implement forest protection and fire prevention work. The state-owned planted forests in Fengcheng County include more than 42,000 hectares of larch forests, which is one of the major key areas of state-owned planted forests in the country; and according to the seasons in the Northeast, after September 15, it will be the mountain fire alert period. Such麻痹carelessness in the county makes it difficult to guarantee the safety of state-owned planted forests, which is a manifestation of irresponsibility towards state property. In addition to the county immediately examining this 麻痹thinking and immediately correcting it in action, Liaoning Province should promptly handle the past incidents of burned planted forests and thoroughly investigate responsibility to arouse the attention of all counties in the forest area to forest protection and fire prevention work.

    辽东省拖延处理烧毁国有人工林事件
    有些县份至今仍不注意护林防火工作
    辽东省不注意检查处理烧毁国有人工林的严重事件，致该省某些县份对护林防火工作不加重视，使国家仅有的少数人工林得不到保护。今春该省海龙、辉南、清原三县共烧毁了国有人工林中十年至十五年以上的落叶松与黑松共七万余株。东北人民政府农林部对此事件极为重视，曾在六月十三日各省林政处长的会议上责成辽东省追究责任。同时东北人民政府农林部到辽东开会的工作人员，也提出了这一问题。八月八日，东北人民政府农林部林政局又给辽东省农林厅林政处去函，令其将海龙等县烧毁国有人工林事件再报省监察委员会处理，但至今这件事仍未处理。这对该省一些培植国有人工林的主要县份的护林防火工作上，起了不良影响。东北人民政府在七月二十三日颁布的“关于护林防火工作的指示”中，曾明确指出：“各林区和半林区的造林重点县由县长召集地方公安、武装、军事部门，及森林工业局、铁路局、工矿等部门，组织护林防火委员会，统一领导护林防火工作”，但凤城县直到八月二十日还没有着手成立护林防火委员会。据该县林政科吕科长谈：该县县长王宴同志不注意护林防火工作，不同意成立护林防火委员会。在该县区长联席会议上，对组织护林防火委员会问题，县长王宴只准讨论三分钟，以致使护林防火工作无法布置与贯彻下去。而凤城县的国有人工林中，落叶松林就有四万二千余垧，是全国国有人工林的主要重点之一；并且按照东北的季节，九月十五日以后，就是山火警戒期间。该县如此麻痹大意，国有人工林的安全很难保证，这是对国家财产不负责任的表现。除该县应立即检查此种麻痹思想并立即在行动上加以纠正外，辽东省对过去烧毁人工林事件，应迅速处理，澈底追查责任，以引起林区各县对护林防火工作的重视。（胡震）
