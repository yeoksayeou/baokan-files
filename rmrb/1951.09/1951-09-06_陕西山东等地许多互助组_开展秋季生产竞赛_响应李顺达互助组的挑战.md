In Shaanxi Province, 69 mutual aid teams in Chang'an and Xingping counties have risen to respond to the challenge of the Li Shunda mutual aid team to carry out the patriotic autumn production competition. Their main responses include the following: guarantee the completion of all preparations for autumn harvesting and wheat planting ten days before the autumn harvest; strengthen the militia's autumn protection work to prevent theft and sabotage by bandits and special agents; pay attention to wind and rain prevention; after the harvest begins, ensure that all millet, corn, rice, etc. are harvested within seven to ten days; plant wheat in a timely manner, etc. In addition, there are conditions such as selecting and retaining good varieties during the autumn harvest, cultivating the land three times and treating seeds with pesticides when planting wheat, helping the families of martyrs and military personnel with autumn harvesting and planting, paying public grain early, and completing patriotic donations.

Among the 69 mutual aid teams that responded to the challenge, 22 are from Xiwangmang Village in Chang'an County, and the remaining 47 are from Xingping County. They are all advanced mutual aid teams in the Northwest New Area. Fourteen mutual aid teams in Xiwangmang Village had already participated in the competition with the Li Shunda mutual aid team, and they have completed the spring and summer production competition plans, creating records for wheat and bean yields. Twenty-eight of the mutual aid teams in Xingping County are model mutual aid teams that emerged during the summer harvest and selection competition this year, and the Zhang Mingliang mutual aid team was also awarded the title of Special Model Mutual Aid Team in Shaanxi Province. These mutual aid teams are full of enthusiastic production competition. In mid-July this year, they launched a patriotic cotton protection competition in the Guanzhong area. This movement has greatly promoted the efforts of farmers in Shaanxi Province to strive for a bumper cotton harvest. (Xinhua News Agency)

The three mutual aid teams led by Lu Hongbin, a Shandong agricultural labor model who responded to the challenge of the Li Shunda mutual aid team in Shanxi Province, and the mutual aid teams of Jia Huibang in Chuxian County, Anhui Province, Lu Dongyang in Fuyang County, and Chen Lianzhang in Yancheng County, northern Jiangsu Province, have successively completed their summer production plans this month and have formulated autumn production plans to further launch the autumn production competition.

From the beginning of July to the present, the three mutual aid teams in Lujiazhuang, Juxian County, led by Lu Hongbin, have applied 51 carts of dry ash and manure and 2,300 catties of soybean cake to 117 mu of late autumn seedling land for the whole village. The amount of top dressing exceeds any previous year. Sorghum, corn, millet and other crops have been hoeed six or seven times, and beans have been hoeed twice. At the same time, pests such as cotton aphids were eliminated. By the beginning of August, the Jia Huibang mutual aid team had cultivated all 40 mu of rice fields three times, and sorghum and cotton had also been hoeed four to six times; the amount of fertilizer applied to the autumn fields this year has doubled compared with previous years. The weeding work in all the autumn fields of the Lu Dongyang mutual aid team has been completed, and the whole team has dug more than ten water wells and two ditches to ensure that there will be no drought or flood before the autumn harvest. The five mutual aid teams including Chen Lianzhang have also completed the summer weeding, pest control, and rush repairs of dikes and weirs according to plan.

In order to welcome the autumn harvest and autumn planting, the above-mentioned mutual aid teams have formulated autumn production plans according to the specific conditions of each team. For example, the autumn harvest and autumn planting plan of the three mutual aid teams led by Lu Hongbin is: strengthen militia patrols to protect the autumn harvest. During the autumn harvest, select good varieties in the fields of every household. Cotton should be picked and sold to the state immediately. Autumn grain should be dried and winnowed clean, and agricultural tax should be paid in full immediately after the autumn agricultural tax is levied. In terms of autumn planting, we will cultivate while harvesting, striving to plow one finger deeper and harrow four to five times than last year. In addition, we plan to expand the wheat field area and strive to completely eliminate stinking wheat next year. The Jia Huibang mutual aid team plans to make preparations for repairing rice fields and adding agricultural tools before the autumn harvest; during the autumn harvest, in addition to timely harvesting, the main task is to do a good job in selecting rice and sorghum seeds. The five mutual aid teams including Chen Lianzhang plan to harvest the middle and late rice in ten days, and at the same time do a good job in seed selection to ensure that the "hat head" excellent rice varieties are harvested, threshed, and stored separately, with a purity of more than 90%.

    陕西山东等地许多互助组
    开展秋季生产竞赛
    响应李顺达互助组的挑战
    陕西省长安、兴平两县已有六十九个互助组，奋起响应李顺达互助组关于开展秋季爱国主义生产竞赛的挑战。他们的应战条件主要的有以下几项：保证在秋收前十天，完成一切秋收和种麦的准备工作；要加强民兵的护秋工作，防止土匪、特务的偷盗和破坏活动；注意防风防雨；开镰后，要保证七天到十天内，将所有谷子、玉米、水稻等收割完毕；及时种麦等。此外，还有在秋收中要选留优良品种，种麦要作到三耕和药剂拌种，以及要帮助烈士家属、军人家属秋收秋种，早缴公粮和完成爱国捐献等条件。
    上述应战的六十九个互助组中，有二十二个互助组是长安县西王蟒村的，其余四十七个互助组是兴平县的。他们都是西北新区的先进互助组。西王蟒村有十四个互助组早就参加了和李顺达互助组的竞赛运动，他们已完成了春夏两季的生产竞赛计划，创造了麦子和扁豆的丰产纪录。兴平县的互助组，有二十八个是今年夏收夏选竞赛中出现的模范互助组，其中张明亮互助组还获得了陕西省特等模范互助组的荣誉。这些互助组充满着饱满的生产竞赛热情，今年七月中旬，他们在关中地区发动了一个爱国保棉的竞赛运动。这个运动，对陕西省农民争取棉花丰收起了很大的推动作用。（新华社）
    曾向山西省李顺达互助组应战的山东农业劳动模范吕鸿宾所领导的三个互助组，和皖北滁县贾惠邦、阜阳县吕东扬，苏北盐城县陈连章等互助组，本月来，已先后完成夏季生产计划，并分别订出秋季生产计划，进一步展开秋季生产竞赛。
    吕鸿宾所领导的莒县吕家庄的三个互助组，从七月初到现在，已为全村的一百一十七亩晚秋苗地施干灰、粪五十一车，豆饼二千三百斤，追肥量超过以往任何一年。高粱、玉米、谷子等作物已锄过六、七遍，豆子锄到二遍。同时还消灭了棉蚜等害虫。贾惠邦互助组至八月上旬为止，已将四十余亩稻田全部耨过三遍，高粱、棉花也已锄过四遍至六遍；该组今年秋田的施肥量较往年增加了一倍。吕东扬互助组全部秋田的锄草工作已经结束，全组并打水井十多个，挖沟渠二条，保证秋收以前不旱不涝。陈连章等五个互助组也按计划完成了夏季锄草、治虫、赶修堤圩等工作。
    为了迎接秋收、秋种，上述各互助组都根据各组的具体情况订出了秋季的生产计划。如吕鸿宾所领导的三个互助组的秋收秋种计划是：加强民兵巡逻，保护秋收。秋收中作到户户田间棵选优良品种。棉花随拾随即售给国家。秋粮要晒干扬净，秋季农业税开征后立即缴齐。在秋种方面实行边收边耕，争取比去年耕深一指，耙四遍至五遍。此外并计划扩大麦田面积，争取明年澈底消灭腥乌麦。贾惠邦互助组计划在秋收前做好整修稻场、添置农具等准备工作；在秋收中，除及时收割外，主要做好稻子和高粱的选种工作。陈连章等五个互助组计划十天收完中、晚稻，同时做好选种工作，保证“帽子头”优良稻种单收、单打、单藏，纯度达百分之九十以上。（新华社）
