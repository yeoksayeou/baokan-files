Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 24th: The full text of Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai's reply to Ridgway's reply letter is as follows:

    To Commander-in-Chief Ridgway of the United Nations Forces:

    Your reply letter of September 23rd has been received.

    Although your letter still refuses to acknowledge the incidents of the United Nations forces violating the Kaesong neutral zone agreement in the air and on the ground before September 10th, which made it impossible to continue the Kaesong armistice negotiations, and attributes these incidents to your side's thorough investigations, on our side, based on the sufficient evidence we have regarding these incidents, and because your side has repeatedly refused to re-investigate, we have reason and the right to continue to demand that your side take responsible action regarding these incidents that we have accused you of. We have instructed our representatives to raise our demands in an appropriate organization formed by agreement between the two sides after the resumption of negotiations in Kaesong to handle these unresolved matters.

    It is common knowledge that the provocative incident caused by your side on August 22nd and the subsequent series of similar incidents are the direct cause of the inability to continue the Kaesong negotiations, and the responsibility naturally lies with your side. Only after your side has expressed regret for the September 10th incident, the most recent incident of the United Nations forces violating the Kaesong neutral zone, and is willing to take responsibility for the violation of the Kaesong neutral zone agreement, do we believe that the armistice negotiations in Kaesong should be resumed immediately, and that the above-mentioned unresolved matters should not continue to hinder the progress of the negotiations between the two sides.

    Regarding a strict agreement stipulating the neutralization of the Kaesong area to ensure that violations of the agreement will not occur again in the future, and to reduce or even eliminate the possibility of interrupting the negotiations in the future, this is our side's consistent demand, but to stipulate these specific, strict, and mutually satisfactory conditions, the liaison officers of both sides have no such authority and must be agreed upon by the representatives of both sides. In order to prevent the armistice negotiations themselves from being affected, we propose that an appropriate organization be formed by agreement between the two sides at the first meeting of the resumed Kaesong armistice negotiations to deal with such issues. We believe that this is the most reasonable approach.

    Therefore, we have ordered our liaison officer to meet with your liaison officer at 10:00 AM on September 24th to discuss the date and time for resuming negotiations in Kaesong.

    Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army

    Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    September 24, 1951

    Ridgway's reply letter is as follows:

    To Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    I have received your letter of September 19th, which was received on September 20th. I reject your claim that there are still so-called incidents of violating the Kaesong neutral zone that have not been dealt with. Each of the incidents that your side reported as violations has been thoroughly investigated. When the United Nations forces were not involved, your side was also truthfully notified, and these cases were closed. I have so instructed my representatives. Similarly, I also reject the allegations repeated in your letter that the United Nations forces violated the neutral zone, making it impossible for negotiations to continue. The responsibility for the unnecessary interruption of the armistice conference lies with your side. You believe in your letter that there is no need to discuss the conditions for resuming negotiations, although in fact the armistice negotiations have been interrupted for a long time due to some incidents or so-called incidents. Therefore, I have ordered my liaison officer to ensure that serious attention is given to this important issue in any future talks with your liaison officer in order to reduce the possibility of future interruptions. Since you are now prepared to end the suspension of armistice negotiations that you announced on August 23rd, my liaison officer will meet with your liaison officer at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM on September 24th to discuss the conditions for resuming armistice negotiations that are satisfactory to both parties.

    General Matthew B. Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command

    September 23, 1951

    李奇微仍然拒绝承认九月十日前各次破坏中立区事件
    金日成彭德怀两将军复信严予驳斥
    重申未了事件应在谈判恢复后由双方协议组织适当机构处理
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】金日成、彭德怀两将军对李奇微复信的答复，全文如下：联合国军李奇微总司令：
    你九月二十三日的复信收到了。
    尽管你的来信仍然拒绝承认九月十日以前联合国军在空中在地面上破坏开城中立区协议使开城停战谈判无法继续进行的各次事件，并诿称这些事件都已经过你方充分的调查，但在我们方面，根据我们所掌握的关于这些事件的充分证据，并由于你方多次拒绝复查，我们有理由也有权利继续要求你方对于这些我方指控的事件进行负责的处理。我们已指示我方的代表在开城恢复谈判后经过双方协议组成的适当机构中提出我方的要求，以处理这些未了事件。
    人所共知，你方所造成的八月二十二日的挑衅事件及其以后的一连串的同类事件，是使开城谈判无法继续进行的直接原因，其责任当然属于你方。只有在你方已经对九月十日即最近一次联合国军破坏开城中立区的事件表示遗憾，并愿对于开城中立区协议的破坏持负责态度之后，我们才认为应即恢复在开城的停战谈判，而不要使上述那些未了事件再继续妨碍双方谈判的进行。
    关于规定开城区中立化的严格的协议，以保证将来不再发生违反协议事件、并减少乃至消除今后使谈判中断的可能性，这是我们方面的一贯要求，但要规定这些具体的严格的而又为双方满意的条件，双方联络官绝无此项权力，必须经过双方代表的协议。为使停战谈判本身不受影响，故我们提议在开城停战谈判恢复的第一次会议上即由双方协议组织一个适当机构去处理这类问题，我们认为，这是最合理的办法。
    因此，我们已命令我方联络官于九月二十四日上午十时与你方联络官会晤，以洽商在开城恢复谈判的日期和时间。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官  金  日  成
    中国人民志愿军司令员  彭  德  怀
    一九五一年九月二十四日
    李奇微的复信如下：朝鲜人民军金日成最高司令官、中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员：
    九月二十日所收到你们九月十九日的来信已悉。我拒绝你们在其中认为尚存在未经处理的所谓破坏开城中立区事件的说法。你方报告称为破坏事件中的每一件，都已经过充分的调查。当联合国军部队并未涉及时，你方亦曾得到如实的通知，而这些案件即告了结。我已如此训令我的代表。同样，我也拒绝你们来信中所重复的所谓联合国军部队破坏中立区事件，使得谈判不可能继续的指控，停战会议中的不必要的中断的责任，是在你方。你们在来信中认为无需要讨论恢复谈判的条件，虽然事实上停战谈判曾因一些事件或者所谓事件而长期中断。因此我已命令我的联络官保证在任何将来与你方联络官的会谈中给予这一重要问题以慎重的注意，以便减少今后再发生中断的可能性。既然现在你们已准备结束你们在八月二十三日所宣布的停战谈判的中止，我的联络官将于九月二十四日上午十时到板门桥与你方联络官会晤，并讨论双方可以满意的恢复停战谈判的条件。
    美国陆军上将联合国军总司令  李  奇  微
    一九五一年九月二十三日
