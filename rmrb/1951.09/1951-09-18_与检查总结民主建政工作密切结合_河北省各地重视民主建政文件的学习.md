In this instance, the study of "Important Documents on the Construction of People's Democratic Power" in various regions of Hebei Province is being conducted in close conjunction with actively preparing for the first Hebei Provincial County Head Conference, and inspecting and summarizing the work of democratic governance. From the beginning, it was emphasized that commissioners and county heads must personally take action, conduct inspections in light of the spirit of the documents and in connection with actual conditions, in order to enhance understanding and conscientiously and effectively summarize the work of governance, inspect at each level, and vigorously urge. Especially after the People's Daily and Hebei Daily successively published editorials and reports, this greatly promoted the entire province, and cadres at all levels of people's governments attached unprecedented importance to the work of governance and the study of governance documents. Study is being carried out more universally and deeply day by day in various regions. Because the study of documents, the examination of ideology, and the summarization of work are closely linked together, ideas have been clarified, work has been guided, and great achievements have been made. Many counties have prepared for convening people's representative conferences through the study of governance documents, and the conferences have made great progress (such as Mancheng, Tongxian, and Gaocheng counties). In the past, some counties in the Shijiazhuang area, which had not convened meetings in accordance with the system or had not convened them for half a year at all, have also seized the time to convene people's representative conferences, and the meetings have generally been better than in the past. Qingyuan County studied governance documents and solicited opinions from representatives at a forum of people's representatives from all walks of life in the county. This method of inspecting governance work and conducting study through mass representatives is more profound in both inspection and study. Some commissioners (Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Dingxian, Cangxian Prefectural Offices), mayors (Baoding), and many county heads (such as Wu'an, Qingxian, Jiahe, Huolu, Funing counties) have personally written reports or self-criticisms on inspecting governance work and published them in newspapers.

At the same time, through study, people have generally gained a preliminary understanding and appreciation of the importance of building people's democratic power, recognizing that "the system of people's representative conferences and people's congresses is the basic system of our country," and that "people's representative conferences at all levels have become the central link in all work and activities of people's governments at all levels." They have also inspected and recognized shortcomings in their work and ideological biases, clarified the powers of the people's representative conferences and people's congresses, the principle difference between representative conferences and cadre meetings, the scope of representatives' powers, and how to fully prepare before the meeting, promote democracy during the meeting, and implement resolutions after the meeting. Cities and counties that have convened people's congresses feel that under the current circumstances, convening people's representative conferences is more appropriate than convening people's congresses, and some counties have overcome the idea of ​​"universal suffrage." In addition, many confused concepts and incorrect understandings have also been exposed, and some of the chaotic thinking of cadres has not been completely clarified.

    与检查总结民主建政工作密切结合
    河北省各地重视民主建政文件的学习
    河北省各地此次对“人民民主政权建设重要文件”的学习，是与积极准备华北首次县长会议，检查总结民主建政工作密切结合进行的。开始时便强调了专员、县长必须亲自动手，根据文件精神，联系实际进行检查，以提高认识，认真切实地总结建政工作，逐级检查，大力督促，尤其在人民日报、河北日报连续发表社论和报道后，对全省推动极大，各级人民政府干部空前地重视了建政工作和建政文件的学习，各地学习是日益普遍深入地开展。由于学习文件、检查思想、总结工作紧密地连结在一起，明确了思想，指导了工作，成绩很大。不少县通过建政文件的学习进行召开人民代表会议的准备，会议开得大有进步（如满城、通县、藁城等县）。过去没有按照制度或半年根本没有召开过会议的，如石家庄专区的不少县，也都抓紧召开了人民代表会议，一般开的也较过去好。清苑县在县各界人民代表座谈会上学习了建政文件，征集代表意见，这种通过群众代表检查建政工作，进行学习的方法，检查与学习均较深刻。有些专员（保定、石家庄、定县、沧县专署）市长（保定）和不少县长（如武安、青县、交河、获鹿、抚宁等县）多是亲自动手，写了检查建政工作的报告或检讨，并在报纸上发表。
    同时在学习中一般初步地认识与体会到了人民民主政权建设的重要，认识了“人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度是我们国家的基本制度”，“各级人民代表会议成为各级人民政府一切工作的一切活动的中心环节”等基本问题。并检查与认识了工作上的缺点思想上的偏向，明确了人民代表会议和人民代表大会的职权，代表会与干部会原则上之不同，代表的职权范围及如何会前充分准备，会中发扬民主，会后贯彻决议的办法。召开人民代表大会的市、县感到在目前情况下召开人民代表大会不如召开人民代表会议为宜，某些县克服了“普选”思想。另外也暴露了不少糊涂观念和不正确的认识，干部的某些混乱思想，尚未完全澄清。
