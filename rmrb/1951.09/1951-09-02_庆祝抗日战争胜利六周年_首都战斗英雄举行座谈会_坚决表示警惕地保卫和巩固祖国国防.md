    Xinhua News Agency, 1st: To celebrate the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan on "September 3rd," and to oppose the US-British imperialists' separate peace treaty with Japan, more than twenty people in the capital, including well-known combat heroes and model workers of the People's Liberation Army, veteran soldiers from the War of Resistance Against Japan, and returned representatives and combat heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers, held a symposium. Participants in the symposium included Jiang Xueshan, commander of the "Tower Hill Hero Regiment" of the Fourth Field Army and a veteran combat hero during the War of Resistance Against Japan; Wang Yushan, a well-known Chinese Matrosov-style combat hero; Zhang Ba, a blasting hero of the First Field Army and a veteran combat hero during the War of Resistance Against Japan; Yu Fuxiang, political commissar of a squadron of the Air Force and a combat hero of the original Third Field Army; Wang Ru, a veteran soldier from the War of Resistance Against Japan and a combat hero of the Chinese People's Public Security Forces; model workers Zhang Renjie and Wang Lianlong; He Zixin, political instructor of the Fourth Company of a certain artillery unit of the North China Military Region, a veteran soldier of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and a special-class combat model during the War of Resistance Against Japan; Fu Bao, a veteran soldier and combat model during the War of Resistance Against Japan; Wang Yougen, a returned representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers and a combat hero of a certain unit of the Volunteers; Zhou Fuqi, a combat hero of a certain unit of the Volunteers and the political instructor of the "Sharp Knife Hero Battalion"; and Wu Fengling, an anti-tank hero. At the symposium, the heroes recalled the historical facts of defeating the Japanese fascist bandits who invaded our country and disrupted peace in the Far East six years ago, and unanimously agreed that the US imperialists have replaced Japan, and the main purpose of their separate peace treaty with Japan is to rearm Japan and make it serve as an aggressive tool of US imperialism in Asia. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this lawless and absurd measure. Wang Lianlong, a veteran soldier from the War of Resistance Against Japan, an instructor in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Public Security Forces, and a model worker, cited the fact that sixty-three comrades in their battalion had their parents, brothers, and sisters die under the bayonets of Japanese imperialism and its running dogs, traitors, and secret agents; the hometowns of seventy-one comrades were destroyed by the inhumane "three alls policy" of Japanese fascism; twenty-nine comrades' own brothers and sisters were forced to be sold to others; fourteen comrades' wives, mothers, and sisters were raped; and the family members of one hundred and sixteen comrades were beaten and cursed, some became insane, and some became disabled and still cannot get out of bed. The heroes who attended the meeting all recalled with grief the atrocities of the Japanese invaders that they had heard and witnessed during the War of Resistance Against Japan. They unanimously agreed that the US-British imperialists dared to exclude China, which fought the longest, sacrificed the most, and contributed the most to the war against Japan, and attempted to sign a one-sided peace treaty with Japan, which is extremely arrogant! Jiang Xueshan, commander of the "Tower Hill Hero Regiment" of the Fourth Field Army, bravely fought against the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan, was wounded five times, lost one eye, and still has a Japanese-made bullet in his left leg. He said angrily: "Whoever dares to obliterate the heroic history of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, we will fight him to the end!" Zhang Ba, a blasting hero of the First Field Army, said that in 1943, more than sixty people were killed in his hometown by the Japanese invaders, and all the houses were burned down. At this time, he was determined to defend the motherland and joined the then Eighth Route Army. One night in 1944, the commando team he participated in captured more than forty Japanese invaders in one fell swoop. Zhou Fuqi, a combat hero of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, pointed out that the US imperialists wanted to follow the old path of Japan, invade Korea, bomb our Northeast, and attempt to attack China, so he joined the Volunteers to defend his home and country. He crossed the Yalu River and went to Pocheon, Korea, where he saw a family of five, whose father, mother, and older brother were all killed by the US imperialist bandits! The bandits also hung their hearts on the trees. This inhuman behavior of the US imperialists aroused the determination of all commanders and fighters to avenge the Korean people, and they marched non-stop day and night to resolutely defeat these man-eating savages. Wang Yushan, a famous Matrosov-style combat hero, touched the wound on his shoulder and said excitedly: "Old hatreds and new grudges must be repaid! I still have an American bullet in my shoulder, which often aches. We cannot allow American robbers to run rampant!" Finally, the heroes unanimously expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, vigilantly defending and consolidating our national defense, and thwarting the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism. The combat heroes of the Volunteers further pointed out that US imperialism is desperately sabotaging the Kaesong negotiations. The Chinese and Korean people are intensifying their struggle, and uniting with the people of all countries in the world, they will surely be able to smash the mad aggression of US imperialism and achieve final victory.
