The Huai River basin has now safely passed the summer flood season, which is a gain from the Huai River project.

The rainfall in the Huai River basin this summer was not greater than last year. The flow of the main Huai River has remained relatively stable. Therefore, the main projects completed this year in the Huai River project, such as the Runheji Diversion Sluice, have not been adequately tested by floods. However, many perennially waterlogged areas along the main and tributary rivers of the Huai River have greatly reduced the disasters of waterlogging because of the dikes reinforced, riverbeds dredged, and drainage ditches dug last winter and spring. For example, the four low-lying areas such as Wu Song Lake and Jiao Ting Lake in the upper reaches of the Huai River, which have not yielded harvests for many years, have harvested a good season of wheat this year because they have drainage ditches, and the inlets are equipped with control gates, which quickly drain the accumulated water. In Xinyang, Huangchuan, Shangqiu and other special districts in Henan Province, more than 400,000 mu of land that was often flooded in previous years was not flooded this year.

As for the northern Anhui region in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the rainfall this year is about the same as in 1949. In 1949, the Fuyang Special District was flooded with 2.5 million mu of land, but this year only 400,000 mu were flooded. That is to say, with the same amount of rainfall, the area affected by the disaster this year was reduced by more than four-fifths compared with 1949. In Zhaotun District, Guoyang County, heavy rains in July last year made it impossible to drain the accumulated water, flooding 150,000 mu of land. This year, the area has drainage ditches, and the Xifei River has been dredged. Although the local rainfall was as heavy as last year, the low-lying areas accumulated water to a depth of five feet during the rain, but the day after the rain stopped, the accumulated water flowed out through the drainage ditches. This year, only more than 10,000 mu of the lowest fields in the district were flooded, but later, early-maturing crops were drained and replanted. Suxian Special District in northern Anhui, which suffered the most severe floods in previous years, has also greatly reduced the degree of waterlogging this year due to the dredging of the Sui River. The floods in the Huai River this summer were not considered small. In Laoguan Lane, Funan County (a newly established county, south of Fuyang County), the water level reached 26.46 meters on July 24 this year, only 1.36 meters lower than last year; the water level in Fangji, the county, on July 25 was only 0.95 meters lower than last year. Only because the Huai River embankments have been reinforced, there have been no accidents.

The fact that the Huai River did not have any accidents during this summer's flood season is also inseparable from the efforts of the people on both sides to prevent floods. As early as mid-June, the Huai River Management Committee convened a flood prevention conference in the three provinces along the Huai River, namely Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, and established the Huai River Flood Prevention Headquarters. Flood prevention organizations have been established in various special districts, counties, and even townships and villages along the Huai River. Before the flood season arrived, various places had made preparations for flood prevention. After the flood season arrived, flood prevention organizations at all levels went to work on the embankments, and responsible cadres personally took charge of the patrol and defense of the embankments by the people. All important embankment sections are equipped with telephones for mutual communication. All of this is the main reason for ensuring the safe passage of the Huai River basin during the summer flood season this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 部分治淮工程已经起了作用  淮河流域今年安度夏汛

    部分治淮工程已经起了作用
    淮河流域今年安度夏汛
    淮河流域现已安然度过了夏汛，这是治淮的一个收获。
    淮河流域今年夏季的降雨量不比去年大，淮河干河的流量始终比较平稳，因此今年治淮中已完成的主要工程如润河集分水闸尚未受到应有的洪水考验。但是，沿淮河干河和支河两岸的许多常年积水的地区，因为去冬今春培修了堤防，疏浚了河床，挖通了排水沟，都大大减轻了内涝的灾害。例如淮河上游的吴宋湖、蛟停湖等四处多年没有收成的洼地，今年因为有了排水沟，进水口又建了控制闸，积水排除很快，收了一季好麦子。河南省信阳、潢川、商邱等专区，也有四十多万亩往年常被水淹的田地今年没有被淹。
    至于淮河中游皖北地区，今年的降雨量和一九四九年比较是差不多的。阜阳专区在一九四九年曾淹地二百五十万亩，今年只淹了四十万亩，就是说同样的雨量，今年受灾的地亩较一九四九年减少了六分之五以上。涡阳县赵屯区去年七月下大雨时，积水无法排出，淹地十五万亩。今年该地挖有排水沟，西淝河又疏浚过，虽然当地下的雨和去年一样大，下雨时洼地积水到五尺深，但是暴雨停后的第二天，积水就顺排水沟流出去了。今年全区只有一万多亩最低的田地被淹，可是以后也排水补种了早熟作物。皖北往年水灾最严重的宿县专区，今年也因疏通了濉河，大大减轻了内涝的程度。淮河今夏的洪水也不算很小，阜南县（新设县，在阜阳县南）老观巷地方，今年七月二十四日的水位曾达到二六点四六公尺，比去年只低一点三六公尺；该县房集地方七月二十五日的水位比去年也只低点九五公尺，只因淮河河堤经过培修，没有出险。
    淮河今年夏汛中没有出险，和两岸人民的努力防汛也是分不开的。早在六月中旬，治淮委员会就召开了河南、皖北、苏北等三个沿淮河省区的防汛会议，成立了淮河防汛总指挥部。沿淮河的各专区、县以至乡、村，都成立有防汛组织。汛期到来以前，各地已作好了防汛的准备。汛期到来后，各级防汛组织就都上堤办公，负责干部亲自掌握民工巡堤和守堤。各个重要堤段都设有电话互通联系。这一切，都是保证今夏淮河流域安度汛期的主要原因。（新华社）
