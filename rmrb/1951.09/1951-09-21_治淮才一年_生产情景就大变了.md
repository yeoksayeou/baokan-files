    After Only One Year of Harnessing the Huai River, Production Scene Undergoes Great Changes
    To the Editor:
    I want to tell everyone about my life situation before and after the Huai River was harnessed.
    My village had suffered from floods year after year since 1927. In 1938, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang breached the Yellow River embankment, making the disaster even more serious. In the past thirteen years, we have only seen two seasons of crops. Our fields are covered with water all year round, and we haven't seen a single grain of food. The Japanese devils and Chiang bandits didn't care whether you lived or died; they desperately demanded grain and money, beating and killing people. I still clearly remember that three out of the four members of Li Xilai's family were killed, leaving behind only a little girl who was only seven or eight months old, and she soon starved to death too. Sixty-eight people in my village were killed by the Japanese devils. In those years, our lives were extremely difficult, and we were forced into a situation where we had no way to go to heaven or earth. Should we abandon the land? But it's hard to leave our homeland, and wouldn't we starve to death if we fled the famine? Many people had to sell their sons and daughters, eating chaff and wild vegetables. Later, I really couldn't survive, so I took my family of twelve to flee the famine. My mother, sister, and younger brother all starved to death outside; I can't help but shed tears when I think about it. But in those years, I don't know how many families had the same experience as mine! In this area alone, there were twenty-nine villages affected by the disaster, and the affected cultivated land area reached 360 hectares.
    I fled the famine for eleven years, and only returned after liberation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the great Huai River harnessing began. After only one year of harnessing the Huai River, the appearance of my village has changed greatly. My family's thirty mu of land (twenty mu is hillside) yielded eight dou of sorghum last year, and this year it yielded more than three shi; last year it yielded nine dou of beans, and this year it is estimated to yield two shi and four dou, and this year's cotton yield has also increased by twenty jin. There are now 365 households and 64 hectares of land in my village (70% is hillside), and my family is just an ordinary family in the village. We are no longer worried about our livelihood, which is something we never dreamed of. This is all the blessing that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have brought to us poor people. I am now an administrative group leader, and I guarantee to formulate a good patriotic production plan. I have also decided to donate 60,000 yuan per season to buy airplanes and cannons, and to do my part in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our country.

### 治淮才一年  生产情景就大变了

    治淮才一年
    生产情景就大变了编辑同志：
    俺要把俺在治淮前后的生活情景告诉大家。
    俺村自一九二七年起，连年遭受水灾。一九三八年蒋介石匪帮扒开黄河堤，灾情更加严重了。十三年来，只见过两季庄稼。俺们地里成年是水，不见一粒粮食。日寇、蒋匪可不管你死活，他们如狼似虎地催粮要款，打人杀人。俺还清楚地记得李喜来一家四口被杀了三口，留下一个才七、八个月的小妮（小女孩），不久也饿死了。俺村被日本鬼子杀了六十八口。那些年，俺们的生活困苦极了，被逼得上天无路，入地无门。把地扔下不要了吧！可是热土难舍，逃荒出去还不是饿死？很多人只得卖儿卖女，吃糠咽菜。俺后来实在没法过活，就带着全家十二口人逃荒出去。俺母亲、妹子、弟弟都在外边饿死了；想起来俺禁不住要流泪。可是在那些年月中，像俺家一样遭遇的人家不知有多少哩！单是俺这一片，受灾的村庄就有二十九个，受灾耕地面积就达三百六十顷。
    俺逃荒在外十一年，解放以后才回来。在共产党、毛主席的领导下，伟大的治淮开始了。治淮才一年，俺村的模样就大变了。俺家三十亩地（二十亩是坡地）去年收了八斗高粱，今年收了三石多；去年收了九斗豆子，今年估计可收二石四斗，今年棉花也多收了二十斤。俺村现共有三百六十五户人家，六十四顷地（百分之七十是坡地），像俺家不过是村中普通的一家。俺们生活不愁了，真是做梦也想不到的事，这都是共产党、毛主席给俺们穷人造的福。俺现在是个行政小组长，俺保证订好爱国生产计划，俺还决定每季捐献六万元买飞机大炮，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中尽俺一分力量。
