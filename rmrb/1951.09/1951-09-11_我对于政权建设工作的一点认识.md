    My Understanding of Political Power Construction Work
    Lecturer, Department of Political Science, Peking University, Zhu Qiwu
    I participated in the inspection team of the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government and went to Hebei Province to inspect the construction of democratic political power. From July 8th to August 3rd, a total of 27 days, I inspected Xinle, Anguo, Dingxian counties, and Shijiazhuang city. During the work, we contacted many cadres, people's representatives, and some of the masses. We listened to their reports, held meetings and discussed issues with them, and conducted home visits or individual talks... We obtained a lot of materials and discovered many problems. Now, I am writing down my understanding and experience as a personal suggestion for further strengthening the construction of people's democratic political power in North China.
    The three counties I visited are all old liberated areas with a considerable democratic foundation. The local people have long used the organizational form of people's representative conferences to manage their own affairs and have convened people's representative conferences more than six times. Generally speaking, they have not only achieved certain successes in promoting democracy and uniting the masses but have also implemented policies and promoted various major government tasks, especially in the movements of patriotic production increase, resisting America and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, which played a significant role in promoting these drives. For example, some places discussed cotton planting plans through representative conferences. Because the representatives mobilized the people, the planting and harvesting of cotton always exceeded the target. Some places discussed the issue of resisting America and aiding Korea through the people's representative conferences, and immediately set off a wave of donating planes and cannons. However, on the other hand, there are problems and shortcomings in their political power construction work. In order to improve on the existing foundation, I will raise issues that we have seen and heard for discussion.
    First of all, I think that the most important and most fundamental issue in political power construction work is ideological understanding. At present, in some places, the enthusiasm for production is high, but the political atmosphere is low. Everyone is buried in economic work and does not pay attention to politics, and they do not pay enough attention to the construction of democratic political power. Some people simply do not know what the People's Representative Conference is all about, and they are indifferent to the election of representatives and the convening of the People's Representative Conference. Some cadres’ thinking is also quite chaotic. One way of thinking is closed-doorism. They are unwilling to let go of democracy and are unwilling to explain their work to the people. Another is to belittle the People's Representative Conference. They think that the cadres are the ones who handle affairs, and the People's Representative Conference is just a formality. Still another way of thinking is the fear of trouble. They are accustomed to the simple working methods of the past and think that convening the People's Representative Conference is not as straightforward as issuing orders. Therefore, they say: "Holding a People's Representative Conference does not implement policies without a cadre meeting, and holding a People's Representative Conference and then holding a cadre meeting is troublesome and time-consuming." Some cadres admit that convening the People's Representative Conference has a certain role, but they simply understand why the People's Representative Conference is convened as promoting work or because it is a task assigned by the higher authorities and must be convened. Most cadres confuse the People's Representative Conference with the cadre meeting, treat the People's Representative Conference as a cadre meeting, and move the set of practices from the cadre meeting to the representative conference. Some People's Representative Conferences have been held many times but in a disorganized way. All of these are due to insufficient understanding that the People's Representative Conference is the basic system of our country and the basic organizational form of the people's political power. Therefore, I believe that raising the ideological level of cadres, strengthening political leadership, establishing the idea that the people are the masters of their own affairs, and earnestly carrying out education on the basic common sense of political power construction, making it a learning movement for all the people, is a matter of utmost urgency.
    Although People's Representative Conferences of all circles have been generally convened in various parts of North China, the several counties we visited have not been able to convene meetings on schedule. Generally speaking, a regular and consolidated system has not yet been formed. Some counties only convene when urged by their superiors, and do not convene if not urged. Some counties have not established a regular working system for the standing committees of the People's Representative Conferences. The general situation is that the standing committee is only convened once for each People's Representative Conference, and it is almost always convened temporarily before the People's Representative Conference. In this way, the standing committee becomes a preparatory meeting for the representative conference. After the representative conference is over, the standing committee is also over. The standing committee does not have resident representatives and full-time personnel, and it cannot contact the masses or implement resolutions. It is simply a mere formality. The county people's government committees and administrative committees also mostly fail to convene according to the prescribed time. Therefore, the first thing that needs to be determined is the issue of holding regular meetings. The issue of holding regular meetings is different in cities and in rural areas. It is easier to solve in cities, but there are difficulties in rural areas. Since the vast majority of counties in North China are in rural environments, this issue is particularly important. Based on the results of our investigations and research in rural areas, we believe that convening the People's Representative Conference in rural areas must be coordinated with the agricultural production season. Therefore, it is appropriate for the county People's Representative Conference to convene twice or three times a year, with each meeting lasting five days. The first meeting should be convened during the winter slack season, because this is around the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. The second meeting should be after the wheat harvest or after the autumn harvest. Once this is determined, a regular meeting system will be formed. If meetings are not held on schedule, it is a violation of the law and should be punished. In addition, temporary meetings may also be convened to resolve a major issue or a specific issue to supplement the regular meetings. The standing committee is a permanent body during the adjournment of the People's Representative Conference. It is also a political consultation body and united front organization for democratic classes, parties, and groups at the local level. Therefore, each county should set up one or two full-time cadres to be responsible for contacting representatives and implementing resolutions, etc. Regular meetings should be held every month to play an active role in assisting the government and mobilizing the people.
    Regarding the convening of representative conferences in various places, the common experience is that as long as a meeting is convened, it is always better than the previous one. Nevertheless, there are still some shortcomings at present. For example, the preparatory work before the meeting is not done enough. During the meeting, the work is only arranged downwards, and little attention is paid to the representatives' proposals. Sometimes, the government work report is not made to the general assembly to accept the people's criticism and supervision. Some counties cannot promote democracy at the meeting, allowing the representatives to fully express their views and have heated discussions. Individual cadres even have a style of arbitrarily taking over and ordering people around, turning the People's Representative Conference into a situation of "cadres making suggestions, representatives speaking, cadres deciding, and representatives passing." The transmission of resolutions and the implementation of policies after the meeting are often neglected. A more common and serious problem here is the lack of serious and responsible handling of proposals. Most counties cannot make case-by-case explanations. Some counties simply classify the proposals and consider it done. As a result, the confidence and enthusiasm of the representatives are affected, and some representatives reflect: "It's useless to make a proposal, why do you ask me to make one!" Some counties originally had 300 or 500 proposals, but later, because of this reason, they were greatly reduced. Now, for example, Anguo County only has dozens of proposals. At the same time, the number of representatives attending each meeting is gradually decreasing. In response to these problems, we will try to put forward the following points: (1) The leadership must pay sufficient attention, and the preparatory work must be fully done before the meeting. (2) All major work of the county people's government should be submitted to the People's Representative Conference for reports, detailed discussions by the people's representatives, resolutions should be made, and the government should earnestly implement them. (3) The meeting must be combined with the current work so that the meeting has a central topic. At the meeting, democracy should be fully promoted, and representatives should be allowed to speak boldly and freely express their opinions. At the meeting, the reporting time should be short, and the discussion time should be longer; more small meetings should be held, and fewer large meetings should be held. (4) A serious and responsible attitude should be adopted when handling proposals. Proposals must be widely collected and sorted out before the meeting, and the earlier the better. They must be carefully reviewed and fully discussed during the meeting. Generally, cases can be divided into three types: those that can be handled, those that can be handled later, and those that cannot be handled. Those that should be handled and can be handled must be resolutely handled. Those that should be handled but cannot be handled temporarily should be handled later. Those that need to be submitted to the higher authorities should be submitted to the higher authorities. Those that should not be handled and cannot be handled will not be handled, but a clear explanation must be given. In this way, everything can be explained, and every case has a follow-up. (5) Resolutions must be resolutely implemented after the meeting, and a regular inspection system must be established.
    During the inspection, we participated in the county People's Representative Conference. Almost all the representatives were farmers, and the issues discussed were all agricultural production issues. At the Xinle County People's Representative Conference held in July this year, several representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors said to us: "There is nothing for us to do, no issues for us." From this situation, we can see the issue of the generation of representatives and the allocation of quotas. In the agricultural areas of North China, the vast majority of the population is farmers, so it is good to mainly take care of farmers. However, all sectors should also be taken care of to make the People's Representative Conference of all sectors more perfect. I advocate that the generation of representatives should strive to achieve the maximum degree of breadth, and the People's Representative Conference should truly reflect the spirit of the New Democratic political power. Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the main classes and also to take care of other classes, as well as all strata, groups, ethnic groups, women, etc. The general principle here seems to be: in cities, worker representatives and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors should account for the majority, generally about 50%; in counties, farmer representatives should account for the majority, but should not exceed about 60%. In cities, the generation of representatives should be based on occupation and combined with region; in counties, the generation of representatives should be based on region and combined with occupation. In counties with fewer administrative villages, it is best to elect one representative for each village. In counties with more administrative villages, several electoral districts can be divided according to natural geography, and representatives can be elected according to the number of electoral districts.
    Speaking of elections, there are still some remnants of old bourgeois democratic ideas in some places, especially prominent in cities. As soon as they mention democracy, they want to hold a People's Congress. As soon as they mention elections, they want to implement universal suffrage. They only focus on formal democracy. However, according to our understanding of the actual situation, the People's Congress generated by universal suffrage does not necessarily have more characteristics of representing the people. Taking women representatives as an example, universal suffrage does not necessarily generate more representatives than negotiated elections. Some industries and groups may find it difficult to guarantee that representatives can be elected. For example, the results of universal suffrage in Anguo County were relatively good. There were 34 women representatives out of 240 representatives, which is more than in other counties. However, there was only one representative from the education sector, and no representatives from the religious sector or ethnic minorities were elected at all. In addition, everyone knows that most Chinese farmers are illiterate, have no experience in elections, and are not very concerned about elections for the time being. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to ask them to have universal suffrage, implement voter registration, and divide electoral districts, and use secret ballots. The result will only bring them many unnecessary troubles and damage the people's enthusiasm. In the past, the universal suffrage in Anguo County took more than two months, making the people tired and bored, delaying work, and affecting production. There was a feeling of "democracy not working." The universal suffrage in Shijiazhuang took more than 40 days, and the people also reflected that the procedures were troublesome and time-consuming. Therefore, universal suffrage is not suitable for the current actual situation of the Chinese people. This point must be affirmed. The method of mixed elections, recommendation, and invitation adopted in various places now is very simple and easy to implement and is full of the spirit of democracy. That is to say, using this method, the people can elect the representatives they are willing to elect, and the breadth of the representatives can also be taken care of comprehensively. This method is generally implemented. In organs, factories, and schools, direct elections can be held. In rural areas, indirect elections can be held by village representative conferences. In organs, factories, and schools, voting can be used. In rural areas, voting by show of hands can be used. The most important thing in the election is the process of deliberation and discussion. With sufficient deliberation and discussion, raising hands or voting are just two ways of expressing. It does not matter which one is adopted. However, raising hands is of course simple and easy to implement and saves time. Therefore, it is undoubtedly a familiar and convenient election method for the general people.

    我对于政权建设工作的一点认识
    北京大学政治系讲师  朱奇武
    我这次参加中央人民政府华北事务部的视察组，到河北省去视察民主政权建设工作，从七月八日起至八月三日止，共二十七天，视察了新乐、安国、定县三个县，以及石家庄市。在工作中，我们接触了不少的干部、人民代表，和一部分群众。我们听他们报告，和他们一起开会，讨论问题，又做家庭访问，或个别谈话……所得到的材料很多，发见的问题也不少。现在把我的一点认识和体验写出来，作为个人对于进一步加强华北人民民主政权建设工作的刍议。
    我所到的三个县都是老解放区，具有相当的民主基础，当地人民早已运用人民代表会议的组织形式来管理自己的事务。而且都曾召开人民代表会议六次以上。一般地说，不仅在发扬民主、团结群众方面，获得一定的成绩，而且贯彻了政策，推动政府各种重大工作，特别是对于爱国丰产、抗美援朝、镇压反革命等运动起了很大的推动作用。譬如：有些地方通过代表会议来讨论植棉计划，由于代表去发动人民，棉花的种植与收获总是超额完成的；有些地方通过人民代表会议来讨论抗美援朝问题，马上便掀起了捐献飞机大炮的热潮。但是，另一方面，他们在建政工作当中不是没有存在着问题和缺点的。为了在现有的基础上提高一步，仅就我们所看到的和所听到的提出来，加以讨论。
    首先，我觉得，政权建设工作中最重要的最基本的问题是思想认识问题。现在，有些地方生产情绪高，政治空气低，大家埋头搞经济，不问政治，对于民主政权建设工作，注意不足。有些群众根本还不晓得人民代表会议是怎么回事，对于选举代表和开人民代表会议还漠不关心。选举出来的代表对于人民代表会议略微知道一些，但是对于代表是做什么的和代表的权利与义务，便不大清楚。有些干部的思想也相当混乱。一种思想是关门主义的，他们不愿意放手发扬民主，不愿意对老百姓交代工作。另一种是轻视代表会议的思想，他们认为办事的是干部，开人民代表会议不过是一套形式。还有一种是怕麻烦的思想，他们习惯于过去简单的工作方式，以为开人民代表会议不如下命令办事直截了当，因此，便说：“开人民代表会议不开干部会不能贯彻政策，开了人民代表会议再开干部会麻烦费事。”有的干部虽然承认开人民代表会议有其一定的作用，但是为什么要开人民代表会议，却简单地了解为是要推动工作，或者因为是上级交下来的任务，不能不开。多数干部将人民代表会议与干部会混淆不清，把人民代表会议当做了干部会，把干部会上的一套做法搬到代表会上去。有的人民代表会议开的次数很多但很乱。这些都是对于人民代表会议是我们国家的基本制度和人民政权的基本的组织形式认识不足。因此，我认为提高干部思想，加强政治领导，树立人民当家作主人的思想，认真进行关于政权建设的基本常识的教育，使之成为全体人民的学习运动，实为当务之急。
    华北各地虽然普遍地召开了各界人民代表会议，但是我们所到的几个县还未能按期召开会议，一般地说，都还没有形成经常的巩固的制度。有的县在上级催促时才开，不催就不开。有的县对于人民代表会议常务委员会没有建立经常的工作制度。一般的情况是：每开一次人民代表会议才开一次常务委员会，而且差不多都是在人民代表会议之前临时召集的，这样把常务委员会变为代表会的预备会，代表会开完了，常务委员会也结束了。常务委员会没有驻会代表和专职人员，不能联系群众，贯彻决议，简直是形同虚设。县人民政府委员会和行政委员会也大半不能按照规定时间召开。因此首先需要确定的是定期开会问题。关于定期开会，在城市里与在农村里不同。在城市比较易于解决，农村则是有困难的。而华北绝大多数的县份都是处于农村环境，所以这个问题就显得特别重要。根据我们在农村调查研究的结果，我们认为，在农村里召开人民代表会议必须与农业生产的季节相配合。因此，县各界人民代表会议每年以开会两次或三次、每次会议以五天为适宜。第一次会议要在冬闲的时候召开，因为这时正是旧历新正十五左右。第二次要在麦收以后，或是秋收以后。这样确定下来，形成一种常会制度。如果再不按期开会，便是违法，应受处分。此外，为了解决某一重大问题或专门问题，也可召开临时会议，以补常会之不足。常务委员会是人民代表会议休会期间的常设机构，也是地方上各民主阶级、党派、团体的政治协商机关和统一战线组织，因此，每县应该设置一两个专职干部，专门负责联系代表，贯彻决议等工作。并应每月举行定期会议，发挥协助政府、动员人民的积极作用。
    关于各地代表会议开会的情况，共同的经验是：只要召开会议，总是一次比一次开得好。虽然如此，目前仍然是存在着一些缺点的。例如：在开会以前，准备工作做得不够。开会时，只是向下布置工作，不大注意代表的提案，而且有时也不向大会做政府工作报告，接受人民的批评和督促。有些县在会议上不能发扬民主，使代表们充分发言，热烈讨论。个别的干部甚至还有包办代替，强迫命令的作风，使人民代表会议变成“干部出主意，代表讲话，干部决定，代表通过”的局面。会后的传达决议和贯彻政策，往往也是被忽略了。这里比较普遍而严重的问题是处理提案不够认真负责。大多数的县不能做到逐案交代。有些县只是把提案分分类，就算完事。于是，影响了代表们的信心和积极性，有的代表就反映：“提了不顶事，还叫俺提干啥！”有的县原有提案三百件、五百件，后来因为这种原因便大量减少，现在如安国县仅有几十件了。同时，每次会议代表出席的人数也逐渐减少。针对着这些问题，我们试提出下列几点意见：（1）领导上要有足够的注意，会前必须充分做好准备工作。（2）县人民政府一切重大工作都应向人民代表会议提出报告，由人民代表详细讨论，作出决议，交政府切实执行。（3）会议须与当前工作相结合，使会议有中心议题。在会议上应充分发扬民主，让代表们大胆说话，畅所欲言。会上，报告时间要少，讨论的时间要多；多开小会，少开大会。（4）处理提案应采取严肃认真的态度。会前须广泛地搜集，并加整理，时间愈早愈好。会中要仔细地审查与充分地讨论。一般案件可以分为能办、缓办、及不办三种。应办能办的须坚决办；应办暂不能办的要缓办；需要请示上级的应请示上级；不应办不能办的则不办，但须明白加以解释。这样才可以做到事事有交代，案案有下文。（5）会后须坚决贯彻决议，并建立经常的检查制度。
    在视察中，我们曾参加过县人民代表会议，代表几乎尽是农民，所讨论的问题也都是农业生产问题。在今年七月间召开的新乐县各界人民代表会议中，有几个工商界代表对我们说：“没有我们的事，没有我们的问题。”从这种情形可以看出代表的产生和名额分配问题。华北农业区域，绝大多数的人口是农民，因而主要照顾农民，这是不错的。但是，还应照顾各界，使各界人民代表会议更加完善。我主张：代表的产生应力求达到最大限度的广泛性，人民代表会议应切实体现新民主主义政权的精神。因此，既须照顾主要的阶级，又须照顾其他的阶级，以至于各阶层、团体、民族、妇女等。这里一般的原则似乎是：在城市里工人代表及工商业界代表应占大多数，大体上以百分之五十为适宜；在县里农民代表应占大多数，但不可超过百分之六十左右。在城市里代表的产生应以职业为主而结合区域；在县里代表的产生应以区域为主而结合职业。行政村较少的县最好每村可以选举一个代表，行政村较多的县可以按照自然地理划分若干选区，根据选区数目选举代表。
    谈到选举，目前有些地方还存在着一种资产阶级旧民主主义的思想残余，在城市里尤其显著。他们
    一提民主，便要开人民代表大会，一提选举，便要实行普选。他们只着重形式上的民主。但是，根据我们所了解的实际情况，目前由于普选所产生的人民代表大会并不具有更多的代表人民的性质。以妇女代表而论，普选并不一定比协商选举所产生的代表多，有些行业、团体恐怕还难得保证可以选出代表来。譬如：安国县普选的结果还比较好，在二四○名代表中妇女代表为三四人，比别的县份都多；可是教育界代表只一人，宗教界、少数民族根本就没有选出代表来。此外，大家还晓得，中国农民大多数是不识字的，过去没有选举的经验，对于选举暂时也不大关心。在这种情形之下，一定要叫他们普选，实行选民登记，划分选区，用无记名投票的办法，结果只会给他们带来许多不必要的麻烦，损害人民的积极性。过去安国县的普选搞了两个多月，弄得人民疲劳厌倦，既耽误工作，又影响生产，大有“民主不起”之感。石家庄的普选搞了四十多天，人民也是反映手续麻烦，浪费时间。所以，普选不适合于目前中国人民的实际情况。这一点是必须肯定下来的。现在各地所采行的选举、推选、邀请混合选举的方法是很简便易行的，而且富于民主的精神。这就是说，用这种方法，人民可以选出他们所愿意选的代表，代表的广泛性也可以照顾到全面。普通实行这种方法，在机关、工厂、学校里可以直接选举，在农村里可由村代表会议间接选举；在机关、工厂、学校里可以票选，在农村里可以举手表决。选举当中最重要的是酝酿和讨论的过程，有了充分的酝酿和讨论，举手或投票不过是表达的两种方式，采取那一种都没有什么关系。不过，举手当然是简便易行，又节省时间，因而无疑地是一般人民所熟习的和便利的选举方式。
