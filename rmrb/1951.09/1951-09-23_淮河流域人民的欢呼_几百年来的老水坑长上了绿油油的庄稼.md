    The People of the Huai River Basin Cheer
    Old Water Pits for Hundreds of Years Now Grow Lush Green Crops
    Comrade Editor:

    I am from Qian Gongpo Village, Weichuan County, Henan Province. My family has eight people and twenty-four mu of land. Qian Gongpo has been an old water pit for hundreds of years, with more than 1,200 mu of land flooded year-round, and we have never seen an autumn harvest. In addition, with the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the exploitation and oppression of landlords and local bullies, the plight was indescribable!

    After liberation, the bandits were eliminated, and the landlords and local bullies were overthrown. We were given land and turned over a new leaf. Chairman Mao, in order to make our lives better and better, called on everyone last year to fundamentally harness the Huai River so that we would no longer suffer from the harm of floods. We dug open the silted-up Du Gong River, Xiaoqing River, and Xiaohei River, and dug eighty-two large, medium, and small ditches in Qian Gongpo. Now there is no standing water in the slope at all. Drainage is also extremely smooth when it rains. This makes our autumn crops look lush and green. The beans are already waist-deep, and it is estimated that this year's harvest can be more than double that of last year. I really don't know how to express the joy in my heart every day. Today's good life is all the result of Chairman Mao's concern for us day and night. A few days ago, when I went to Xuchang to see my brother Shunqing (he is a brick worker), I personally saw how enthusiastic the worker brothers were. I also saw that the farms were experimenting with machine farming. I thought that our country would be built so beautifully in the future! I thought that we are happy now, and our descendants will be even happier. In addition to donating 50,000 yuan to purchase airplanes and artillery to support the Volunteer Army, I also plan to buy a stone roller and a mill after the grain is harvested, to produce well and repay Chairman Mao. I have already made a patriotic production plan to ensure that I will do my utmost to step up the management of the Huai River, increase production, and defend our beloved motherland and good life.

    淮河流域人民的欢呼
    几百年来的老水坑长上了绿油油的庄稼编辑同志：
    我是河南省洧川县前宫坡村人，全家有八口人，二十四亩地。前宫坡是几百年的老水坑，常年有一千二百多亩地受淹，根本没有见过秋庄稼。加上那时国民党反动派的统治，和地主、恶霸的剥削压迫，困苦情形就不用说啦！
    解放后，土匪被肃清了，地主、恶霸被打倒了，我们分了土地，翻了身。毛主席为了让我们的日子越过越好，又在去年号召大家根治淮河，不再使我们遭受水灾的危害。我们挖开了淤塞住的杜公河、小青河、小黑河，在前宫坡内又挖了八十二条大、中、小沟渠，现在坡内一点存水也没有了。在下雨的时候排水又极顺利。这就使得我们的秋庄稼，看上去是绿油油一片，豆子已经齐腰深，估计着今年可以比去年多打一倍多粮食，我每天心里的高兴劲真是不知怎样说了。今天这个好日子，都是毛主席白天黑夜替咱操心的结果。前些日子我到许昌去看我兄弟顺清（他是个做砖的工人）时，亲眼看着工人兄弟们的干劲可大哩，又看见农场里在试验机器种地，我想着咱们的国家将来真不知要建设多美了！我想着现在咱幸福，子孙后代是更幸福了。我除了捐献五万元购买飞机大炮支援志愿军外，我还打算粮食打下来再买个石滚，买一盘磨，好好地生产，报答毛主席。我已订了爱国生产计划，保证拿出我的最大力量加紧治淮，提高生产，保卫咱们的可爱的祖国和好日子。
