    All Enterprises and Institutions Should Do a Good Job in Materials Work
    Technical and Materials Departments Should Be Closely Integrated
Editor:
    I am a staff member of the materials department of a state-owned heavy industrial factory. On August 13th, the People's Daily published a short commentary, "Starting from the Whole, Do a Good Job in Materials Work," and a newsletter from the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. We have also felt the problems raised here in our work. As far as I know, these problems existing in the railway sector also exist in various enterprise departments. In various enterprises, leading cadres at all levels simply focus on production tasks and often do not pay attention to the work of the materials department. General technical cadres, simply in order to complete tasks, often do not consider how much material is used or what kind of material is used. Although the materials department understands the material usage, it does not have the power to intervene. Sometimes when opinions are put forward on how to control usage and how to save, technical cadres always believe that these matters should not be managed by the materials department, but should be saved automatically by the departments using the materials. In order to complete production tasks, the technical department is unwilling to be restricted by the system; if there is a dispute between the two sides, the production department always says that the materials department does not take care of production, and the materials department rarely receives support from the leadership. This has led to material waste and also caused emotional fluctuations among some staff members of the materials department. To do a good job in materials work, the phenomenon of non-integration between the technical department and the materials department must be eliminated.
    I suggest that the management departments of various enterprises should let all personnel discuss the newsletter of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and the People's Daily short commentary, in order to thoroughly correct the existing deviations and further improve the materials work.

### 各企业单位应做好材料工作  技术与材料部门应密切结合

    各企业单位应做好材料工作
    技术与材料部门应密切结合编辑同志：
    我是国营某重工业工厂的材料部的工作人员。八月十三日人民日报上登载了“从整体出发，做好材料工作”的短评和铁道部材料局的通讯，这里所提出的问题，我们在工作中也曾感到过。据我所知，铁道部门存在着的这些问题，在各企业部门也是存在的。各企业中由于各级领导干部单纯地注重生产任务，对材料部门的工作常是不加过问。一般的技术干部，单纯为了完成任务，对于使用材料多少及使用何种材料等等，常是不加考虑的。材料部门虽然了解材料使用的情况，但是没有权力去过问。有时提出来如何控制使用和如何节省的意见，技术干部总认为这些事情不应由材料部门来管，而应由使用材料的部门自动去节省。技术部门为完成生产任务，不愿受制度的限制；如果两方面有了争执，生产部门总是说材料部门不照顾生产，材料部门也很少得到领导方面的支持。这样就造成材料上的浪费现象，也引起材料部门某些工作人员情绪波动。要想做好材料工作，技术部门与材料部门不结合的现象必须消灭。
    我建议各企业的管理部门，应将铁道部材料局的通讯和人民日报短评，让全体人员进行讨论，以便彻底纠正现在存在的偏向，更进一步做好材料工作。
