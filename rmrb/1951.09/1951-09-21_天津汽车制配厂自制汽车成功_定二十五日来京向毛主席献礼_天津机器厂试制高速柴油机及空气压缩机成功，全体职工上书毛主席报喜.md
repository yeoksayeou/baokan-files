The employees of the Tianjin Automotive Parts Factory have successfully assembled two self-made Jeep vehicles yesterday. Preliminary test drive results are good, with each liter of gasoline able to travel 24 kilometers. This is a great contribution to our country's industrial production by the factory's workers in order to welcome National Day and present a gift to Chairman Mao. In addition, a station wagon made by the factory's employees to participate in the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition will also be assembled within days. All parts of these three vehicles are domestically produced. To celebrate the great victory of Chinese workers' first successful automobile manufacturing, the factory's employees decided to report the good news to Tianjin Mayor Huang Jing, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Huang Huoqing on the 23rd of this month. The two Jeeps are scheduled to drive to Beijing on the 25th of this month.

After the factory's employees successfully manufactured a four-cylinder engine in June, they were determined to manufacture cars themselves. In late August, when the higher authorities officially assigned the factory the task of manufacturing two Jeep vehicles, all the factory's employees were ecstatic. Workers in the forging and riveting shop proposed guarantees one after another. They said, "Last time, we didn't get our hands on making the four-cylinder engine, but this time, we must have our share in making the car!" However, when the workshop director announced the plan to everyone, explaining that the task had to be completed in 25 days, some people thought the deadline was too short and that even one car might not be made. Seeing everyone's hesitation, the workshop director immediately encouraged everyone, saying, "This time, our manufacturing of cars is a gift to Chairman Mao to celebrate National Day. Although there are difficulties, we must overcome them..." The workers were greatly encouraged when they heard it was a gift to Chairman Mao. Each group set up a challenge competition plan, guaranteeing to overcome any difficulties and manufacture the cars on schedule. During the manufacturing process, the workers thought of many ways and improved the tools. When worker Liu Kerang was making the water tank baffle, he ran to an auto repair shop outside the factory to see what it looked like because he didn't have a drawing, looking a little and making a little, going back and forth more than ten times. In order to ensure that the new cars were made before National Day, Zhou Chengxuan, the factory's car driver, also participated in the assembly work. Technician Hu Tongxun has personally participated in the manufacturing every day from the beginning to now. With the joint efforts of all the employees, the two Jeeps were successfully assembled ahead of schedule on the 17th and 19th respectively. When the new cars were successfully test-driven in the factory, all the employees cheered enthusiastically. (Originally published in Tianjin Daily)

All employees of the Tianjin Machine Factory of the Machinery Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department successfully trial-produced a 100-horsepower mobile high-speed diesel engine and air compressor on August 28, one month ahead of schedule, during the patriotic competition covenant movement. These are two types of high-speed and lightweight machines that our country has never manufactured before, and it is a major achievement in Tianjin's metallurgical and casting industry. All the employees of the factory wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to report this great achievement. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:

Our 100-horsepower mobile high-speed diesel engine and air compressor were successfully trial-produced in the patriotic competition covenant movement. This is the achievement of your wise leadership; it is also the crystallization of the labor and creation of our working class under the call of your great political thought. We combined politics and technology to establish a high degree of self-confidence in building an industrial country; we combined labor and technology to create 128 kinds of tools and solve the difficulties in trial production. We deeply realize that with your leadership, we have the determination to overcome difficulties; with your leadership, we can use our brains, operate machines, and create high-speed precision machines that have never been produced in Chinese history. We are not afraid of the so-called "economic blockade" of the American imperialists, and we will defeat American imperialism on the economic construction front. We have full confidence, and we also have the greatest determination, because we have the leadership of the Communist Party, and we have you. We would like to dedicate these two high-speed precision machines, which have never been produced in the history of the country, to you.

We wish you good health and congratulate the Chinese working people on their great victory in the anti-American and aid-Korea movement.

All employees of the Tianjin Machine Factory of the Machinery Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department

    天津汽车制配厂自制汽车成功
    定二十五日来京向毛主席献礼
    天津机器厂试制高速柴油机及空气压缩机成功，全体职工上书毛主席报喜
    天津汽车制配厂职工，自制的两辆吉普车，已于昨日装配完竣，初步试车成绩良好，每立升汽油可行驶二十四公里。这是该厂工人为了迎接国庆，为了向毛主席献礼，对于我国工业生产的伟大贡献。另外，该厂职工为参加华北区城乡物资交流展览会而赶制的旅行车一辆，日内亦可装配完竣。该三辆车全部零件均为国产。该厂职工为庆贺中国工人首次制造汽车成功的伟大胜利，决于本月二十三日向天津市黄敬市长、中国共产党天津市委员会、天津市总工会黄火青主席报喜。两辆吉普车并定于本月二十五日开赴北京。
    该厂职工于六月份自制四缸引擎成功后，就决心自己制造汽车。八月下旬，当上级正式交付该厂制造两辆吉普车的任务后，全厂职工都兴奋若狂。锻铆间工人们纷纷提出保证，他们说：“上回做四缸引擎没插上手，这回做汽车可得有咱一份！”但当车间主任向大家宣布了计划，说明要在二十五天内完成这个任务时，有些人认为期限太短，一辆车也不准能制成。车间主任见大家表示犹豫，就立即鼓励大家说：“咱们这回制造汽车，是作为庆祝国庆节给毛主席的献礼，虽然有困难，我们一定要克服……”工人们听说是给毛主席献礼，情绪大为振奋，各小组都订了挑战竞赛计划，保证克服任何困难，按期把汽车制造出来。在制造过程中，工人们想了许多办法，改进了工具。工人刘克让做水箱档的时候，因为没有图样，就跑到厂外一家汽车修理厂去看样子，看一点作一点，一直往返了十多次。为保证国庆节前制出新的汽车，厂内汽车司机周承煊也参加了装配工作。技术员胡同勋从开始到现在每天都亲手参加制造。在全体职工的共同努力下，两辆吉普车乃提前于十七日、十九日分别装配成功。当新车在厂内试车成功时，全体职工热烈欢呼。（原载天津日报）
    中央重工业部机器工业局天津机器厂全体职工在爱国竞赛公约运动中，试制一百马力移动式高速柴油机及空气压缩机，已提前一个月于八月二十八日成功。这是我国未曾制造过的两种高速轻便机器，是天津市冶铸工业上的一项重大成就。该厂全体职工特写信给毛主席，报告这一伟大成就。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们的一百马力移动式高速柴油机及空气压缩机，在爱国竞赛公约运动中试制成功了。这是您英明领导的成绩；也是我们工人阶级在您伟大的政治思想感召下劳动创造的结晶。我们以政治和技术结合，树立了建设工业国家的高度自信心；我们以劳动和技术结合，创造了一百二十八种工具，解决了试制中的困难。我们深刻地体会到：有了您的领导，我们就有克服困难的决心；有了您的领导，我们就能开动脑筋，运转机器，创造出中国历史上未曾出产过的高速精密机器。我们不怕美帝国主义者的所谓“经济封锁”，我们将在经济建设战线上战胜美帝国主义。我们有充分的自信，我们也有最大的决心，因为我们有了共产党的领导，有了您。我们谨将这两部全国历史上未曾出产过的高速精密机器献给您。
    祝您身体健康祝贺中国劳动人民在抗美援朝运动中的大胜利。
    中央重工业部机器工业局天津机器厂全体职工同上
