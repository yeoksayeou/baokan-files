    Experiences in Combining Production Work with Political Work
    Factory Director of a Certain Factory in Lushun and Dalian, Sun Yi

    Editor's Note: This article illustrates the unified relationship between political work and economic work through the author's personal work experience. The Party's political leadership is the foundation of production work. Strengthening the Party's political work to further promote production is an important issue, and we hope everyone will pay attention to studying it.
        In the summer of 1948, when the leading comrades of the Party visited our factory, they said to me: "The political atmosphere in your factory is weak..." At that time, I didn't understand. I only thought about "learning whatever you do," neglecting and abandoning political work and political study. I catered to the one-sided idea that "less talking and more practical work is the only way to run a factory well." This led me to delve into the narrow circle of administrative management work, relying solely on devising methods, establishing systems, writing charters, and drafting detailed rules (this situation was at its peak before the establishment of the responsibility system on April 2, 1950, i.e., in February and March). Under the domination of this one-sided viewpoint, many problems arose in our work. When summarizing the problems in the establishment of the responsibility system, I once said: "...When problems arise, we simply use administrative methods and systems to block them. We block them today and block them tomorrow, and the more we block, the more problems arise..." After a period of practical work lessons, my mind gradually cleared up. Under the direct guidance of the superior Party organization, I began to learn to follow the mass line and concentrated the wisdom of the masses to establish several important systems in production.
    In short, during this period of work, the education given to us by the Party and the masses was strict and profound. However, due to our low political level, we were still unable to combine political work and economic work very well, and we failed to deeply realize that the two are interdependent and advancing as a whole. Therefore, many shortcomings still existed in our work.
    First, the promotion of advanced work experience was not based on politics, resulting in some detours. After the establishment of the responsibility system, in order to consolidate the responsibility system, we organized and led a movement to promote the advanced working methods of the Wang Zhaoda team. At that time, certain achievements were made both in the depth of promotion and in the types of work promoted. However, the main shortcomings were that in the process of promotion, we only simply learned Wang Zhaoda's advanced technology, systems, and working methods, and paid insufficient attention to Wang Zhaoda's patriotism and the root of his advancement—class consciousness. As a result, the effect was not significant. Although each team learned the working methods of the Wang Zhaoda team, their work still could not keep up with the Wang Zhaoda team. The Wang Zhaoda team was able to continuously develop because it had a certain political consciousness as its foundation. Recently, in the quality inspection campaign, although we adopted the method of examining various erroneous ideological viewpoints and calling on everyone to learn the idea and method of guaranteeing quality stipulated in the patriotic pact of the Wang Zhaoda team to improve the class consciousness of the workers, we encountered serious ideological obstacles from the very beginning because of the lack of political education in the past. This forced us to turn back and first examine the ideological roots that caused the low production quality in order to raise everyone's ideological awareness.
    Second, the lack of political study in administrative departments often leads to problems in work. In the administrative and business departments of our factory, the tendency to not study politics and ignore political work is serious. Many cadres and staff comrades believe that the only skill required for working in the factory should be "quick with the abacus," and there is a harmful phenomenon of mechanically and rigidly handling affairs according to forms and formulas. For example, some products have already left the warehouse, and the customers have already started using the machines, but our factory's accounts are still waiting for the settlement of several items, which affects the turnover of funds and wastes a considerable amount. On the other hand, problems often arise in work because of the lack of study. For example, when our administrative management section discovered that workers were quarreling with the "master chef," it issued a notice on the rules for managing the cafeteria, which included the following clause: "Workers who quarrel with the master chef three times will not be given food." As a result, not only did the phenomenon of quarreling not decrease, but the phenomenon of quarreling and fighting greatly increased. Another example is that the inspection of staff work is simply carried out in accordance with specifications and standards. They only know that the quality is not good, and the workers are responsible. If the repairs are not good, wages are not paid. They do not investigate and study where the problem lies. They did not rely on the workers to study the problems to improve quality.
    Third, the serious purely technical viewpoint among employees has affected the learning of advanced technology. Many employees think that improving technology can solve everything, but they do not know that only having technology without the combination of other aspects of work, especially without the combination of political work, will not only fail to give full play to the existing technology, but also prevent them from learning advanced technology. Some people have a purely technical viewpoint in their minds, ignoring politics, despising politics, and even despising those who do political work. People who are transferred to do political work do not think this is glorious, but mistakenly think that this is a work without a future. At present, the political and technical levels of our management staff are still very low (70% of the workers directly involved in production have not yet mastered production technology). Our political work must fight against various erroneous ideological tendencies, such as correcting the view that technology is "private property," breaking the conservative thinking and complacency that are immersed in the existing technical level, and correcting the phenomenon of hindering the learning of more advanced science and technology in socialist countries due to blindly worshipping the science and technology of imperialist countries. Facts have proved that with such erroneous views, our technology will inevitably not advance.
    The fundamental reason for the above-mentioned shortcomings is our low political level, our unclear understanding of relying on the working class, and the influence of certain bourgeois methods of managing factories.
    To improve our future work, we must first clarify our thinking. No matter what kind of movement we launch, we must conduct sufficient class education for our employees, so that the production movement has a solid foundation of the broad workers' class consciousness. Party organizations should include the political education of workers as one of their regular tasks.
    However, we must not advocate abandoning one aspect while promoting another. Continuing to delve into professional knowledge and improve technology is still a very important thing. This time, our factory conducted a major quality inspection, which was, on the one hand, to carry out political and ideological education and launch criticism and self-criticism on the basis of improving the patriotism and sense of ownership of all employees, and to find out the ideological obstacles that prevent the continuous improvement of quality—the mentality of making do. So that all employees recognized the harm of this erroneous ideology, and everyone rose up to oppose it. On the other hand, we actively improved technical management and all other administrative management methods, so that economic work and political work were combined, and considerable results were achieved. In the future, to consolidate this achievement and expand this achievement, we must continue to unswervingly rely on the working class from the ideological perspective, follow the mass line, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses to manage the people's factories.

    生产工作与政治工作结合的体验
    旅大某厂厂长  孙毅
    编者按：这篇文章通过作者的亲身工作经历，具体地说明了政治工作与经济工作统一的关系。党的政治领导是生产工作的基础。加强党的政治工作，进一步推动生产是一个重要的问题，希望大家注意研究。
        一九四八年夏天，党的领导同志参观我们工厂时，曾对我说过这样一句话：“你们工厂政治空气淡薄……”当时我没有想通，“干什么学什么”，忽视和丢掉了政治工作与政治学习，而迎合了“少说话，多实干，才能办好工厂”的片面想法，使自己钻到单纯依靠订办法、立制度、写章程、拟细则的狭窄的行政管理工作小圈子之中（这种情况在一九五○年四月二日未建立责任制以前，即二、三月间，为最高峰）。在这样一种片面观点的支配下，工作中发生了很多问题。当总结建立责任制的工作问题时，我曾这样说：“……出了问题就单纯由行政上用办法、制度来堵，今天堵，明天堵，结果越堵问题越多……”经过一段实际工作的教训，使我的头脑才逐渐清醒起来。在上级党组织的直接指导下，我开始学习走群众路线，集中群众的智慧，建立了生产中的若干重要制度。
    总之，在这一段工作中，党和群众对于我们的教育是严格而深刻的。但由于我们的政治水平不高，还不能使政治工作与经济工作结合得很好，在认识上还未能深刻体会到两者是相依并进的整体，因之在工作中仍然存在着不少的缺点。
    第一、推广先进工作经验，没有以政治为基础，结果走了一些弯路。在责任制建立之后，为巩固责任制度，我们曾有组织有领导地开展了推广王兆达小组的先进工作方法运动。当时无论在推广的深度和推广的工种上，都取得了一定的成绩，但主要缺点是：在推广过程中，只单纯地学习了王兆达的先进技术、制度和工作方法，对王兆达的爱国主义精神和其所以先进的老根——阶级觉悟——却注意得十分不够。因此收效不大，各小组虽然都学会了王兆达小组的工作方法，但工作上，仍跟不上王兆达小组。王兆达小组因为有一定的政治觉悟为基础，所以能够不断地发展。最近，在质量大检查运动中，虽然我们采取了检查各种错误思想观点，号召大家学习王兆达小组爱国公约里所订保证质量的思想和方法，来提高职工群众的阶级觉悟。但因过去缺乏政治教育，所以一开始就遇到了严重的思想阻碍。这就不得不使我们重新回过头来，首先检查所以使生产质量不高的思想根源，来提高大家思想觉悟。
    第二、行政部门缺乏政治学习，工作常出问题。在我厂各行政业务部门中，不学习政治和忽视政治工作的偏向是严重的。很多干部和职员同志认为在工厂工作的唯一本领应当是“算盘快”，存在着机械死板地照表格按公式办事的有害现象。举例来说：有的产品已出库，顾主已把机器开动使用了，而本厂账目还等待若干项目的结算，这样就影响资金周转，浪费相当大。另一方面是因为不学习，工作上常常出毛病。像我们的行政管理科在发现工人与“大师夫”吵架时，曾颁发一个管理食堂规则的布告，其中有这样一条：“工友和大师夫吵架三次，不给饭吃”，结果吵嘴现象不但没有减少，反而连吵带打的现象大大增加起来。又如检查工作人员工作只单纯遵照规格标准行事，只知质量不好，由工人负责，修理不好，不发工资。究竟问题何在，也不调查研究。没有依靠工人群众，研究问题，达到提高质量的目的。
    第三、职工中单纯技术观点严重，结果影响了对先进技术的学习。很多职工以为技术提高了可以搞好一切，却不知道仅有技术而没有其他各方面工作的结合，特别是没有政治工作的结合，不但现有的技术得不到发挥，并且不能学习先进技术。有些人思想上存在单纯技术观点，不问政治、轻视政治，甚至轻视做政治工作的人。被调动担任政治工作的人，自己并不认为这是光荣的，却错误地认为这是没有出息的工作。目前我们各项管理工作人员的政治水平和技术水平还是很低的（在直接生产的工人中有百分之七十的工人还未掌握生产技术），我们的政治工作必须针对各种错误思想倾向进行斗争，如纠正把技术看成是“私有财产”的观点，打破那些沉醉于现有技术水平的保守思想和自满情绪，以及纠正由于盲目崇拜帝国主义国家的科学技术，因而妨害了学习社会主义国家的更高明的科学技术等等现象。事实证明，有了这样的错误观点，我们的技术必然不能前进。
    上述各种缺点的根本原因，是由于我们的政治水平不高，对依靠工人阶级的思想认识不明确，以及受了某些资产阶级管理工厂方法的影响。
    要改进今后的工作，首先就应从思想上明确起来，不管开展任何运动，均需向职工进行充分的阶级教育。使生产运动具有以广大工人的阶级觉悟为稳固的基础。党的组织要把对工人的政治教育列为经常工作之一。
    但是也不能提倡一面丢掉一面。继续钻研业务、提高技术仍是一件极重要的事情。这次我厂进行质量大检查，就是一方面进行政治思想教育，在提高全体职工爱国主义、主人翁思想的基础上，开展批评与自我批评，找出质量不能继续提高的思想障碍——凑合思想。使全体职工认清了这一错误思想的危害性，大家起来反对；另一方面更积极改进技术管理和其他一切的行政管理方法，使经济工作与政治工作得到结合，收到了相当的效果。今后要巩固这种成果，扩大这种成果，必须继续从思想上坚定不移地依靠工人阶级、走群众路线，集中群众的智慧来管理人民的工厂。
