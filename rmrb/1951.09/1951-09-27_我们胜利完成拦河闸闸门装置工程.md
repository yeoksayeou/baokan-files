    We Successfully Completed the Installation Project of the Sluice Gate for the Interception Dam
    Gu Linbao, Chief of the Huai River Sluice Gate Engineering Team
    We, the Shanghai metalworkers with a glorious history of struggle, formed a Huai River Sluice Gate Engineering Team of more than 700 people and came from Shanghai, thousands of miles away, to Runheji to undertake the installation of the gates for the interception dam and the intake dam. These large gates and all their power equipment were manufactured by our Chinese worker brothers themselves, without any help from capitalist countries' manpower or resources. The manufacture and installation of the gates were firsts for us, but we successfully completed these projects. We know that the Huai River is related to the safety of the lives and property of 58 million peasant brothers in the Huai River basin in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces. When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River to the south, although the peasant brothers along the Huai River were living in very difficult conditions due to being under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they still did their best to support the troops with manpower and resources. Our Shanghai workers were able to be liberated quickly, and this was inseparable from their strong support. For this reason, we have an even greater responsibility to help these 58 million peasant brothers who are flesh and blood with us to carry out water conservancy construction and eliminate floods.

    Based on the above understanding, we enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "Be sure to harness the Huai River well," and, carrying the concern and expectations of the people of the whole country, bravely threw ourselves into the work of harnessing the Huai River.

    We started work on June 8th, preparing on one hand and waiting for the completion of the concrete pouring on the other. After Qian Zhengying, Deputy Minister of the Engineering Department of the Huai River Harnessing Committee, issued a call on June 11th to complete the interception dam project before June 25th, we immediately took tense action to strive to complete the entire project before the flood season. We knew that "running fast will lead to success, running slowly will lead to failure," and that we had to run fast while ensuring the quality of the project. But at that time, we had only completed some preparation work and the installation of some oil cylinder bases (installing the oil cylinder is a mechanical method of controlling the gate), the concrete work had not yet been completed, and a batch of materials and tools had not yet been transported. There were only ten days left until the 25th, and the flood season might arrive at the end of the month. At that time, the leading comrades considered that if the project could not be completed on schedule, in order to ensure the safety of the entire project, they would have to block one or two openings of the sluice with earth. When we learned of the leading comrades' intention, we felt that we would have no face to return to Shanghai if we failed to complete the task. Some comrades said, "Even if we have to use people to block it, we can't use earth to block it!" With this spirit of self-sacrifice, all of our workers took on this arduous task.

    The shock work began. The comrades of our team were gathered from various factories and had never worked together before. At the beginning of the work, there were inevitably many difficulties due to poor coordination. But we brought into play the high degree of unity and mutual assistance of our class, and were not only able to achieve close cooperation, but also brought into play the greatest enthusiasm and creativity. The crane workers improved the use of the boom and worked closely with the planer workers, so that the installation of the oil cylinders was increased from one every three hours to three every hour. The riveters created a record of driving 675 rivets in half a day. The comrades of the brother unit, the concrete team, with an amazing spirit of overcoming difficulties, improved their work efficiency and further accelerated our work progress.

    We overcame difficulties and improved work efficiency. The concrete team and our sluice gate engineering team both received commendations and condolences from the headquarters. The commendations from the higher authorities further inspired the comrades' work enthusiasm. We persisted in working even when we were sweating while sitting still. Once, the temperature rose to 116 degrees Fahrenheit, and the steel gate panels reflected high heat. The riveters and painters, under the scorching sun, clung to the gate panels and worked intensely. Sweat dripped from their faces like rain, and their eyes could not be opened. The leading comrades resolutely wanted them to rest, but no one was willing to come down. It was not until the leading comrades stopped the power source for driving the rivets—the air blower—making it impossible to continue working, that the comrades came down to rest. By this time, two comrades had fainted. When the workers of other departments saw this situation, they automatically organized to help the riveters with their work so that they could take turns to rest. A heavy rain fell from the sky, and the river water kept rising. This was a sign that the flood was coming soon. "Don't let the flood race past us!" Everyone shouted while braving the heavy rain to rush the installation. A People's Liberation Army comrade who was on sentry duty nearby saw this situation and took out his umbrella and stood aside to shield us from the rain. One umbrella could not shield several people, but his noble class friendship powerfully inspired us. After work, everyone went back to eat dinner, and the heavy rain was still falling. Three comrades automatically climbed onto the overpass and persevered in working for more than two hours in the heavy rain and with empty stomachs, putting up a reed mat. They said while working, "It doesn't matter if the three of us get wetter, this way, everyone can get less wet!" In the entire installation project, all kinds of technicians did their best. The planer workers played a leading role in all movements; the pipe workers carefully checked out a dozen blockages in the oil pipes and improved the installation method of the pipes; the welders often worked day and night; the electrical workers worked intensely under the slogan of "where the project is going, the lines are being erected"; the blacksmiths and other workers often did whatever work came their way, ensuring the rear support work.

    After tense efforts, we finally ran ahead of the flood and successfully completed the gate installation project of the interception dam on June 26th. We will continue to work hard on this basis and strive to win a second victory, making the last project in the Runheji dam project—the gate installation project of the intake dam—better and faster (this project has been completed on July 20th).

    我们胜利完成拦河闸闸门装置工程
    淮河水闸工程队总队长  顾林宝
    我们有着光荣斗争历史的上海五金工人，组成了一支七百多人的淮河水闸工程队，从千里以外的上海到了润河集，担任拦河闸和进湖闸闸门按装工作。这些大闸门及其全部动力设备，都是我们中国工人兄弟不用任何资本主义国家人力物力的帮助，自己亲手制造出来的。闸门的制造与按装工作，在我们说来还是第一次，但是，我们胜利完成了这些工程。我们知道，淮河关系河南、安徽、江苏三省沿淮流域五千八百万农民弟兄生命财产的安全。在人民解放大军渡江南下时，沿淮农民兄弟虽因长期处在国民党反动派统治下，生活非常困难，但他们仍然尽最大的努力，以人力和物力支援部队。我们上海工人能够迅速地得到解放，和他们的大力支援是分不开的。为此，我们更有责任帮助这五千八百万和我们血肉相连的农民兄弟，进行水利建设，消灭水患。
    基于上面的认识，我们热烈响应了毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的号召，带着全国人民的关心与期望，勇敢地投入了治淮工作。
    我们是六月八日开始工作的，一面进行准备工作，一面等待着灌洋灰工作的完成。当治淮委员会工程部钱正英副部长在六月十一日发出要在六月二十五日以前完成拦河闸工程的号召以后，我们立刻紧张行动起来，争取在汛期以前将全部工程完成。我们知道“跑快了就成功，跑慢了就失败”，又要跑得快，又要保证工程质量。但当时我们只做完了一些准备工作和部分油压筒底座（按油压筒是控制闸门的一种机械）的按装工作，洋灰工程还没有做完，器材和工具也还有一批没有运到。离二十五日只有十几天了，汛期可能就在月底到来。当时，领导同志曾考虑到万一不能按期完工，为保障整个工程的安全，只好用土把水闸堵上一两孔。我们知道了领导同志这个意图，觉得完不成任务，便没脸回上海。有的同志说：“用人堵，也不能用土堵！”我们全体工人就以这种自我牺牲的精神，把这个艰巨的任务担负了起来。
    突击工作开始了。我队同志是由各个不同的工厂集拢来的，从来没有在一起合作过，开始工作时，不免有许多因配合不好而发生的困难。但我们发挥了本阶级的高度团结互助的精神，不仅能做到密切配合，并且发挥了最大的积极性和创造性。起重工人改善了把杆的用法，并和钳床工人紧密配合，使得油压筒的按装，由每三小时一个，提高到每小时三个。铆钉工人创造了半天打六百七十五个铆钉的纪录。兄弟单位洋灰大队的同志们以惊人的克服困难的精神，提高了工作效率，更加速了我们的工作进度。
    我们克服了困难，提高了工作效率，洋灰大队和我们水闸工程队都得到了指挥部的通令表扬和慰劳。上级的嘉奖，更鼓舞了同志们的工作热情。我们在闲坐着都要淌汗的情况下，坚持着工作。有一次，气温上升至华氏一一六度，钢闸板反射着高热，铆钉工人和油漆工人们在烈日曝晒下，紧贴着闸板，紧张地工作，脸上像下雨一样地淌着汗水，眼睛都睁不开了。领导同志坚决要他们休息，但谁都不肯下来。直到领导同志把打铆钉的动力来源——送风机停止，无法继续工作时，同志们才下来休息。这时已有两个同志晕倒了。其他部门的工人看到了这种情形，便自动地组织起来，帮助铆钉工人进行工作，以便轮班休息。漫天的大雨下来了，河水不断上涨，这是洪水快要到来的先兆。“不要让洪水赛过去呀！”大家一边喊着，一边冒着大雨抢装。在旁边放哨的一位人民解放军同志看到这种情形，把他的伞拿了出来，站在一旁给我们遮雨。一个雨伞是遮不住几个人的，但他这种崇高的阶级友爱，有力地鼓舞了我们。下班了，大家都回去吃晚饭，大雨仍在下着。有三个同志自动地爬上天桥，在大雨中，饿着肚子坚持工作两个多小时，搭起了一片席棚。他们一边干一边说：“我们三个淋得再湿些都没关系，这样，可以使得大家都少淋湿些！”在整个按装工程当中，各种技术工人都尽了最大的努力。钳床工人在一切运动中，都起了带头作用；管子工人曾仔细地检查出油管中的十几处阻塞，并改进了管子的按装方法；电焊工人常常是昼夜不停地工作；电气工人在“工程进行到那儿，线路架设到那儿”的口号下，紧张地工作着；打铁工人与其他工人，常是来什么活干什么活，保证了后援工作。
    经过紧张的努力，我们终于跑到了洪水的前面，在六月二十六日，胜利地完成了拦河闸的闸门按装工程。我们还要在此基础上再接再厉，为打第二个胜仗而奋斗，把润河集闸坝工程中的最后一个工程——进湖闸的闸门按装工程，做得更好更快（按此工程已在七月二十日完成）。（本文转载皖北日报，经编者略加修改。）
