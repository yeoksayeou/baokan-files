    Only Work is Happiness
    ——Remembering Communist Party Member Luo Yunzhang
    Ji Hua
    I met Luo Yunzhang in the autumn of the year before last. He was the Accounting Section Chief of the Grain and Forage Department of the Northwest Military Region Supply Department, and also the beloved Party Branch Secretary. Over the past year, his image has often appeared before my eyes. He had no legs and had great difficulty moving around, having to grab two small wooden stools with both hands and move with great effort. But he went in and out of the office every day, stubbornly working on the supply problems of the Northwest Region troops.

    It was a snowy dusk. The four thousand bags of flour piled in the yard were about to be soaked by the snow. "If the flour is damaged, the troops will go hungry." Luo Yunzhang was anxious about this. It didn't look like the snow would stop soon, and the director wasn't around. What could be done? Finally, he told the minister his opinion. Soon, people from nearby departments were mobilized to move the flour. Luo Yunzhang personally went to the scene to direct. He moved non-stop, grabbing his small stools and weaving in and out of the busy crowd. This spirit moved everyone, and they worked even harder to move the flour. In four hours, all four thousand bags of flour were completely moved away.

    This incident sparked my interest in learning more about Luo Yunzhang. I wanted to learn more from him, and my wish was fulfilled.

    In 1933, Luo Yunzhang joined the Red Army, and soon became a glorious Communist Party member. After the Long March, he arrived in northern Shaanxi. In 1936, in a surprise attack by bandits in a certain place in Gansu, he suffered serious leg injuries, which later festered. Medical treatment was ineffective, and both legs were amputated. Before the wound had healed, he repeatedly asked to work, and the organization made him the instructor of the first team of disabled veterans for recuperation. In 1942, when Sheng Shicai was arresting communists in Xinjiang, he was also in Xinjiang. Sheng Shicai did not even spare this legless man, and he was arrested and imprisoned. He was not released and returned to Yan'an with comrades such as Ma Mingfang until 1946. Due to the torture of four years in prison, Luo Yunzhang was emaciated and unrecognizable. However, this did not shake his iron will; he became even stronger. Soon after returning from Xinjiang, he enthusiastically asked to work. The Party organization wanted him to continue resting, but he did not agree. He was very upset and said to General Wang Zhen: "Nothing is more distressing than not working; only working is happiness!"

    After a while, Luo Yunzhang was assigned to the Hongtao Printing Factory in the Jin-Sui District, initially working as a banknote custodian, and later as an accountant. The daily work was very busy, more than his weak body could bear; but he was still unwilling to rest more and wanted to participate in production. He weighed some cotton and, using his spare time, he and his wife each held a spinning wheel to spin thread. After a few months, they earned more than seven lengths of foreign cloth, which solved many personal difficulties. He said: "I don't want to cause trouble for the organization, asking for this today and that tomorrow, thinking that I am a disabled soldier, gloriously amazing, and making a lot of demands for resolution." After entering the city of Xi'an, a responsible comrade asked him what difficulties he had. He straightforwardly replied: "None." He also said: "There is disability compensation, health care fees, and subsidies, and life is also taken care of. There are no difficulties."

    Luo Yunzhang's daily life is busy and lively. He gets up very early every day, always ahead of the young men. After getting up, he wakes everyone up and conducts study. He studies very seriously. For a period of time, he went to a very far place to attend classes every day, and he always went very early. No matter what kind of meeting it was, he was always the first to arrive. Once, at a general meeting of all Party members, it was long overdue, and some comrades arrived late. He severely criticized these comrades. He hated this kind of undisciplined lifestyle.

    During the rest time after dinner, you will be surprised to find that he has become younger. He plays the flute, and he sings "The East is Red, the Sun Rises,..." with people, tapping the beat with his hand. The singing is cordial, sincere, and comes from the depths of his heart. At this time, it will make you completely forget that he is the legless Luo Yunzhang.

    只有工作才是快乐
    ——记共产党员罗云章
    季华
    前年秋天，我认识了罗云章。他是西北军区供给部粮秣处的会计科长，也是大家爱戴的党的支部书记。一年来，他的形象时常呈现在我的眼前。他，没有了腿，行动起来非常困难，只能两手抓着两个小木凳，要很吃力地挪动。但他却每天出入于办公室，为西北区部队的供给问题顽强地工作着。
    是一个大雪天的黄昏。院子里堆的四千袋面粉，很快就要给雪水浸透了。“如果面粉受了损失，部队就要饿肚子。”罗云章为这事情焦急着。看样子，雪不能马上停止，处长又不在，有啥办法呢？最后，他把自己的意见告诉了部长。一会，就把附近各部门的人员动员起来，搬运面粉。罗云章亲自到场指挥。他抓着小凳不停地移动着，穿插在忙碌的人群中间。这种精神感动了大家，大家搬运的劲头更大了。四个钟头，就把四千袋面粉完全运走了。
    这件事引起了我去了解罗云章的兴趣，我想从他身上知道更多的东西，我的愿望是实现了。
    一九三三年，罗云章参加了红军，不久，便成了光荣的共产党员。经过长征，到达陕北。一九三六年在甘肃某地突遭马匪军的袭击，腿部受重伤，以后腐烂了，医治无效，割掉了双腿。在伤口还没有痊愈的时候，他就再三要求工作，组织上便让他当了残废教养干部第一队的指导员。一九四二年，盛世才在新疆大捕共产党人时，他也正在新疆。盛世才连这个没有腿的人也没有放过，他被捕入狱了。一九四六年才和马明方等同志，被释放回到延安。由于四年监狱生活的折磨，罗云章已消瘦得没有人样了。然而，这并没有动摇了他那钢铁般的意志，他变得更坚强了。他从新疆回来不久，就热情地要求工作。党组织要他继续休息，没有答应他的要求。但他很难过，曾对王震将军说：“没有工作最使人苦恼，只有工作着才是快乐的！”
    过了一段时间，罗云章被派到晋绥区洪涛印刷厂，起初做保管纸币的工作，后来做会计。每天的工作繁忙得很，他那虚弱的身体已够承担了；但他仍不愿多休息，还要参加生产。他秤了些棉花，利用公余时间和他老婆各把着一辆纺车纺线。几个月后，就赚洋布七丈多，给个人解决了不少困难。他说：“我不愿给组织找麻烦，今天要这个，明天要那个，以为自己是个残废军人，光荣的了不起了，提出一大堆困难，要求解决。”进入西安城后，有一次，负责同志问他有啥困难，他率直地回答说：“没有。”又说：“有残废金，有保健费和津贴，生活上也有照顾，什么困难也没有。”
    罗云章的日常生活是紧张、活泼的。他每天起床很早，总是在小伙子们的前头。起来之后，唤醒大家，进行学习。他很认真学习，有一段时间，他每天到很远的地方去听课，而且每次都去得很早。不论开什么会，他总是先到场。有一次开全体党员大会，过时好久了，有一些同志才到会，他严厉地批评了这些同志。他很厌恶这种自由散漫的生活作风。
    在晚饭后的休息时间里，你会惊奇地发现他是变得年青了。他吹笛子，他和人一块唱着“东方红，太阳升，……”手还打着拍子。歌声是亲切的，诚挚的，是从他心的深处发出来的。这时，会使你完全忘记了，他就是没有腿的罗云章。
