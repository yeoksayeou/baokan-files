    I. Reader Du Binqing Exposes Illegal Activities of Jin Guangyu, etc.
    Editor:
    Jin Guangyu, a section chief of the Shenyang Public Security Brigade (that is what the accompanying public security officers called him, as we heard), committed a crude violation of human rights when he escorted a train to Taipingchuan Station. I am now informing you of the course of this event, and I hope you will forward it to the relevant authorities for investigation and handling.

    At 1:24 PM on July 14th, a special train of the Shenyang Public Security Brigade, heading from Shenyang to Qiqihar, arrived at Taipingchuan Station. Because of the need to change locomotives, the train had to stop at Taipingchuan Station until 3:04 PM before departing. The stationmaster of Taipingchuan Station explained this situation to the public security officers escorting the train from the Shenyang Public Security Brigade several times, but the escorting section chief ordered the public security officers to bring both stationmasters of Taipingchuan Station with handguns and arbitrarily insulted them. One stationmaster was taken onto the train, and the other stationmaster, being on duty and needing to direct the train's entry into the station, was only spared from being taken onto the train after repeated explanations. Instead, two officers with handguns followed him.

    At 3:04 PM, after the special train departed, the stationmaster who had been taken onto the train was subjected to a rude interrogation by the section chief of the Public Security Brigade. It was not until the train reached Baichengzi that they released the detained stationmaster after repeated negotiations by the Baichengzi Station. We believe that Jin Guangyu and others exhibited a serious style of warlordism and that their affiliated agency should punish them to prevent similar incidents from occurring again.

    II. Letter from Shenyang Public Security Bureau Explaining the Handling of the Incident
    Editor:

    We have received the letter exposing the violation of human rights by staff members of our bureau. After repeated investigation, the situation reflected in this letter has been fully verified. This train was transporting prisoners to a certain location in Heilongjiang for labor reform, and our bureau dispatched personnel to escort them. During negotiations regarding this special train at Shenyang Station, it was agreed that there would be no long stops along the way and no locomotive changes. If a long stop was necessary en route, the consent of the person in charge of the escort was required. When the train arrived at Taipingchuan Station, it was necessary to change locomotives, and the stop was lengthy, but the escorting personnel were not notified in advance. The escorting personnel believed this violated the original agreement at Shenyang Station and therefore expressed dissatisfaction. At this time, Jin Guangyu, the overall person in charge of the escort, not only failed to stop the dissatisfaction of his subordinates but also brought a stationmaster from Taipingchuan Station to Baichengzi as a "hostage" in a rude manner.

    Jin Guangyu, as a national civil servant, knowingly violated the law. Our bureau revoked his position on July 24th.

    Other relevant personnel were given demerits, warnings, or criticized and educated according to the severity of their circumstances.

    The occurrence of this incident shows that we have not provided sufficient education to our affiliated cadres in our daily work, so we should review and be vigilant. We have decided to circulate this matter to all affiliated departments for educational purposes.

    We also suggest that the Heilongjiang Provincial Public Security organs give Comrade Peng Dengyang, who made mistakes with Jin Guangyu, appropriate punishment.

    In addition, our bureau has sent another letter to Taipingchuan Station to express our apology and condolences to the two stationmasters, Han and Jiang.

                                    Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau

### 沈阳市公安局工作人员  金光宇等侵犯人权  该局调查属实已予适当处分

    沈阳市公安局工作人员
    金光宇等侵犯人权
    该局调查属实已予适当处分
    一、读者杜彬青揭发金光宇等的违法行为编辑同志：
    沈阳市公安大队的一个处长（我们听到与他同来的公安队员是这样称呼他的）金光宇，当他押车到太平川车站时，竟干下粗野的侵犯人权的事情。我现在把这件事的经过告诉你，希望你们转告有关机关调查处理。
    七月十四日一点二十四分，由沈阳开往齐齐哈尔的沈阳市公安大队专用车一列，开抵太平川车站，因为换机车的关系，这一列车必需在太平川站停至三点零四分才能开出。这种情况，经太平川车站站长几次向沈阳市公安队的押车同志进行解释，但是这位押车的处长同志仍命令公安队员，提着手枪，把太平川车站的两个站长一齐都找来，随便加以辱骂。一个站长被押到车上，另一站长因正在值班，要指挥火车进站，经过再三解释才没有被押上车，而是派了两个持手枪的跟着他。
    三点零四分，这列专用车开出后，被押在车上的这位站长，受到了公安大队处长态度蛮横的审讯。直到车抵白城子时，经过白城子车站的再三交涉，他们才把这个被押的站长释放了。我们认为金光宇等存在着严重的军阀主义作风，其所属机关应予惩处，以避免再有类似事情发生。
              读者  杜彬青
    二、沈阳市公安局来信说明对此事件处理经过编辑同志：
    关于揭发我局工作人员侵犯人权的信收到了。这封信所反映的情况，经过我们反复的调查，已经全部证实。这一列车，是载运犯人至黑龙江某地进行劳动改造的，由我局派员押运。在沈阳车站交涉这列专用列车时，曾商妥沿途不作长时的停留、不换机车。中途如需要作长时间的停留，须取得押运负责人员的同意。这一列车到达太平川车站时，要换机车，停车时间很久，但事先并未通知押运负责人员，押运人员认为这是违反了原来在沈阳站的协商，所以表示不满。这时押运总负责人金光宇不但没有制止下级的不满情绪，而且以蛮横的态度将太平川车站一站长带到白城子作“人质”。
    金光宇是国家公务人员，知法犯法，我局已于七月二十四日起撤销其职务。
    其他有关人员亦按情节轻重分别给予记过、警告处分或予以批评教育。
    这件事情的发生，表明我们平时对所属干部教育不够，所以我们应检讨并引起警惕。并已决定将此事通报所属，用以进行教育。
    我们并建议黑龙江省公安机关对与金光宇一起犯错误的彭登扬同志，给予适当处分。
    此外，我局已另函太平川车站向韩、姜两位站长表示道歉，并致慰问。
                                    沈阳市人民政府公安局
