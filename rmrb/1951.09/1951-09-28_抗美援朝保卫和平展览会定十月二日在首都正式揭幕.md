    The "Exhibition on Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Defending Peace," organized by the China Peace Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in celebration of the second National Day, is scheduled to officially open on October 2nd at the Hall of Literary Glory in the Forbidden City, Capital.

    The materials prepared for the exhibition consist of three main parts. The first part introduces the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in coordinating with the Korean People's Army in resisting the American imperialist aggressor troops on the Korean front, and uses facts to illustrate that the Chinese and Korean people's forces have become an invincible force for defending the motherland and defending world peace. The second part, entitled "Exposing the Aggressive Conspiracy and Aggressive Nature of American Imperialism," contains photographs and drawings of American imperialists undermining the Kaesong armistice negotiations and the San Francisco Conference manipulated by them, and illegally creating the "Japanese Peace Treaty." The third part comprehensively introduces the situation of the Chinese people participating in production and construction, supporting the front, and consolidating national defense with practical actions in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend peace. It also introduces the upsurge of the world peace movement, the great role of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance, and the growth of the strength of the Asian people against imperialist aggressors. It therefore illustrates that the American imperialist plan to enslave Asia can be completely defeated.

    The materials exhibited in this exhibition include a large number of gifts, trophies, and photographs given to the people of the motherland by the Volunteer Army brought back from Korea by the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, as well as combat and life photos of the Volunteer Army recently taken by photographers on the Korean front; photographs and charts introducing the actual situation of domestic production and construction, donating airplanes and cannons, universally establishing patriotic conventions, and extensively promoting preferential treatment work; and photographs and charts introducing the recent situation of the peace movement. The exhibition welcomes all organizations, groups, schools, and general citizens of the capital to visit at that time.
