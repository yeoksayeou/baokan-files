    A. It's time for Catholics to unite and save themselves
    The Nanjing Military Control Commission deported Monaco national, Archbishop Libri, on September 4th. This is something that brings great satisfaction to the people. Archbishop Libri was the most important figure manipulating Catholicism in China and an imperialist element with conclusive evidence of hostility towards the Chinese people. He was an utter accomplice of the Pharisees, hated by Jesus. People only need to look at his actions to know that he was a traitor who corrupted Catholicism. He was originally the "Envoy" of the Vatican to the Chiang Kai-shek government, arriving in China on December 14, 1946. During the Liberation War, in order to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's anti-people war, Archbishop Libri openly declared that he would use Catholicism to assist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "nation-building work." He flew to various important dioceses, such as Northeast China, Beijing, and Taiyuan, to deploy his anti-people activities. In August 1948, he transferred Irish priest William A. McGrath to China, who went to Tianjin, Guangzhou, Guilin, Chongqing, and other places to develop the "Legion of Mary" organization, ostensibly "to respect the Holy Mother," but actually to carry out anti-people conspiracies, including collecting intelligence and organizing terrorist activities. They spread rumors everywhere, such as saying: "The American army will be here by the end of the year, you can do whatever you want," "This is the world of demons, quickly ask the Holy Mother to drive the demons away," and also promoted "atomic bombs," "World War III," and "The Holy Mother appearing in the skies above the American army," and so on. They incited and instigated church members to "never cooperate with the People's Government until death." They also organized young people, secretly gave them military training, and had them participate in "anti-communist guerrilla teams." The "Legion of Mary" director in Tianjin, Dutchman Man Jishi (real name: [Translator: Please provide the actual name]), and Wang Keming and others swore an oath to assassinate patriotic Catholics, such as Wu Kezhai, the director of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association. Just as Tianjin Catholics were indignantly accusing the "Legion of Mary" of its crimes, Archbishop Libri, in his capacity as archbishop and with divine authority, called on church members to "go straight to heaven for those who die for the Legion of Mary" ("die" means "martyrdom," which should be interpreted as dying for imperialism, ascending to the "heaven" of imperialism), still using deceptive tricks to drive church members to die for him.
    All of Archbishop Libri's reactionary behavior was carried out under the guise of being "above politics," but he could not justify himself in any way. In the spring of 1949, at the beginning of the liberation of Tianjin, Archbishop Libri forwarded instructions from the Vatican, believing that "wearing a gray uniform" was also a "great sin that would send you to hell." This was not "above politics," but "above" normal interference in China's "politics." Tianjin Bishop Wen Guibin (French, already deported) copied his mantle and amplified it, believing that those who went to Nankai University should also go to hell. Archbishop Libri adopted the most vicious means of threats against all our just patriotic actions, abusing so-called "divine authority" to suppress patriotic activities within the church. He frequently used "deprivation of divine authority" to intimidate patriotic bishops and priests; and used "schism," "going to hell," and "being abandoned" to suppress patriotic church members. After liberation, hundreds of reactionary books were printed and distributed in the name of Catholicism in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, and other places, such as "How to Deal with the Communist Party," "Atomic Bombs and Cosmic Spirit," "The Holy and Public Church," etc. These are all reactionary books that are anti-historical, anti-scientific, distort church doctrine, and are anti-people and anti-government. Among them, the reactionary books published and printed under the cover of the Shanghai Catholic Diocesan Association, directly directed by Archbishop Libri, amounted to more than 300,000 copies, including the extremely reactionary "Learning Reference." He also instructed Tianjin Diocesan Bishop Wen Guibin (Jean De Vienne) to draft a "Statement of All Catholic Bishops in China," distributed throughout the country, attempting to use his "envoy" status to coerce bishops in various places to sign it, in order to carry out his purpose of undermining our Three-Self Reform Movement.
    It is a well-known fact that there are imperialist elements within Catholicism, and that they have used Catholicism in many places to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. In addition to Archbishop Libri, there are many other examples. For example, American spy Raymond de Jaeghei, a Belgian priest who preached in China, also received instructions and funding from Archbishop Libri to organize the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" and the "People's National Construction Promotion Association" in North China. The "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" established organizations in five provinces and two cities in North China, conducting "defection," "intelligence gathering," and "assassination" for Chiang Kai-shek, and once plotted to assassinate people's leaders in Pingshan.
    The "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" was divided into four brigades, with twenty-five priests sharing the responsibility of directing the various brigades. For example, the spy elements Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, and Fang Ruhui (all French) of Jin Gu University, who were captured in Tianjin, hid radio stations and communicated with the enemy. The American spy Madinu, who was announced by the Beijing Military Control Commission on August 18 for plotting to assassinate people's leaders, was also the bishop of Yixian and Archbishop Libri's "Beijing representative." It was American spy Ford, of the Meixian Catholic Church in Guangdong, who, under the direction of Archbishop Libri, released seven Chinese traitors who had dealings with Japan in the Jining Diocese of Suiyuan. In addition, there were many other spy cases discovered in Xianxian, Hebei, Shenyang, Qiqihar, Jiaozuo, Beijing, Meixian, Guangdong, and other places. All these examples raise an urgent question for our vast number of patriotic Catholics: These Pharisaical bandits, occupying the leading position in Catholicism, using Catholicism to harm our motherland and also harm Catholicism itself, can we tolerate this any longer?
    B. Several ideological issues among Catholics
    There is no doubt that good Catholics do not want to be used by imperialist elements -- Pharisees. But when the imperialist secret agents and spies hidden in the church are repeatedly captured, and they have already made Catholicism so smoggy, why are many of our church members still unable to stand up firmly to oppose the imperialist elements -- the accomplices of the Pharisees -- within the church, to separate Catholicism from imperialism, and to launch a self-reliance and reform movement? This is mainly because church members have been deceived and oppressed by imperialist elements for a long time, resulting in many wrong views and concerns.
    What are those concerns?
    First, they do not understand whether church members should love their country. Second, many church members have always believed that the words of the clergy (priests and even the Pope) can never be wrong, and they dare not doubt them, thinking that even a slight doubt is a great sin that will send them to hell. Third, they are afraid of being considered apostates and schismatics if they oppose the imperialist elements in the church, and they are afraid of the suppression of divine authority. Now let me talk about these three issues.
    1. The issue of patriotism and faith
    Some Catholics refuse to oppose imperialism and refuse to participate in the self-reliance and reform movement, thinking that it is a matter of faith.
    But is this the fact?
    I think everyone will remember that before liberation, the imperialist elements headed by Archbishop Libri, did they not use the same tones as the Kuomintang when they slandered the Communist Party? For example, saying that communist society is for animals, not for humans, and so on. Now, the fact that the Communist Party is leading the people of the whole country to build the country and improve the people's lives has completely proved that they are slandering. But they have changed their new provocative slogan, saying: "The Communist Party is good in everything, but they don't believe in God. The Communist Party and those who believe in God are irreconcilable, so we must fight the Communist Party to the end."
    Let's look at the facts again. It is true that the Communist Party does not believe in God. If we say that the Communist Party and those who believe in God are irreconcilable, why are Islam, Buddhism, and other religions still alive and well?
    Freedom of belief is a matter for each individual, and no one has the right to force anyone else. This is clearly stipulated in the Common Program. Facts have proved that the Communist Party has abided by the Common Program. On the contrary, the imperialist elements headed by Archbishop Libri have been clamoring for "anti-communism" at all times, attempting to undermine the people's trust in the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, inciting rebellion, alienating the unity of the various democratic parties and the people, provoking Sino-Soviet friendship, and engaging in espionage activities. This is not only an extreme act of slander and provocation, but also a serious violation of the Common Program and an act of hostility towards the people of the whole country. Father Liu Fudong of the South Church in Beijing said at a priests' symposium: "If we were in power, we would have killed all the Communists. Catholicism is so 'anti-communist,' but how has the Communist Party treated us?" This statement is conscientious and completely in line with the facts.
    The imperialist elements also said: "Our church members can love the country, but they cannot love the Communist country." This is also a self-deceiving sophistry. Please open the history of the imperialists' missionary work in China. In the 1844 Treaty of Wangxia and the 1858 Treaty of Tianjin, in which imperialist missionaries participated, especially in the invasion of the Eight-Power Allied Forces in 1900, they planned and participated in many activities to invade China, inciting Chinese Christians to cause disturbances everywhere, and wholeheartedly trying to trap our Chinese nation into becoming slaves. So, was it because China had a Communist Party at that time?! In the past "May 30th," "September 18th," and "January 28th" and other patriotic movements, they all used "revolution, living demons" to intimidate and slander us church members and carry out suppression. This shows that the center of the problem is not because of the Communist country that we are not allowed to love our motherland, and even less because the Communist Party does not believe in God, but because they can no longer continue to invade and oppress China, so they want to be irreconcilable with the Communist Party, that is, the Chinese people. But why are we Chinese Christians still being deceived by them?
    The imperialist elements also deceive us by saying: "The religious worldview is idealist, and the Communist Party is materialist. There is no common foundation between the Communist Party and Catholics." This is purely a shameless provocation. The purpose is to prevent us from loving our country. If we carefully study the Common Program, we and the Communist Party have freedom in the matter of belief, but in many other matters, everyone has a common responsibility to the motherland and must unite and work together. Although our worldviews are different from those of the Communist Party, we are all Chinese and have a responsibility to love our motherland. We must all oppose feudalism, compradorism, and fascist ideology. We must all oppose the aggression of imperialists against our motherland. We must all fight for China's independence, democracy, peace, unity, and prosperity. Can we welcome the imperialists to invade our motherland and welcome the imperialists to use atomic bombs and artillery fire to kill the oppressed people of Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other countries? Can we believe the words of the imperialist elements and overthrow the world of peace, benevolence, and people's autonomy to welcome the rule of imperialism?
    We love our motherland, not only because we ourselves grew up in China, our ancestors were in China, and our descendants will also live in China, but also because today's China is already the China of the people themselves, and it is essentially different from the China of the past. The people's China led by Chairman Mao has crushed the oppression of domestic feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism and the centuries of harm inflicted on us by foreign imperialism. The construction achievements after liberation are great and amazing. The situation of currency inflation and soaring prices that could not be solved in twelve years has also been overcome. Bandits have been eliminated and people's lives are stable. The national railways and highways are unobstructed, and it is possible to travel directly from Manchuria to Guangxi. The national land reform is nearing completion, and the peasants have been freed from the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords, thereby increasing their enthusiasm for production, and the production of grain and cotton has approached the pre-war level. The harnessing of the Huai River has achieved great success this year. Amazing achievements have also been made in overcoming famine, unemployment, and various epidemics. There has also been great progress in the cultural education of workers and peasants. No government in China in the past has ever done or could have done so much for the people. The Chinese people have also achieved greater victories, which is to resist the US and aid Korea. In cooperation with the Korean people, they have defeated US imperialism in Korea, thereby defending our motherland. Because of these victories, not only has it been proven that our country is unprecedentedly strong, but also its international status and prestige have been improved. In such a short period of two or three years after liberation, there have been such great achievements, and the future prospects are even more beautiful. The people of the whole country have been closely united around Chairman Mao and have unlimited trust in the government. So, what reason do we have to listen to the provocations of imperialist elements and overthrow such a beautiful country?
    Believing in God does not conflict with opposing imperialism, and loving the country and loving the church should be consistent. If one talks about opposing imperialism and thinks that it is anti-faith, then it is simply saying that he believes in imperialism and does not distinguish between God and imperialism. Is this not a great insult to God by the imperialist elements? Every pure believer, if he loves the church, he must love his motherland, love the people, love peace, and love democracy even more, and resolutely oppose the disasters that imperialism has brought to mankind. Because only in this way can we be in line with the doctrine of universal love. We resolutely break off relations with imperialism, freely and happily love our God, and join hands with the people of the whole country under the leadership of Chairman Mao to fight for the construction of a new China. We are good citizens, that is, good church members. This is a self-evident truth. Church members should not have any doubts about this.
    2. The issue of the clergy
    Chinese Catholics have always been deceived, always believing that the Pope, archbishops, bishops, and priests are never wrong in everything, especially the Pope is absolutely never wrong. Church members are only allowed to blindly follow, and are not allowed to have any questions about the clergy. The main purpose of the imperialist elements in emphasizing this so much is to make church members blindly follow the Pope and foreign missionaries so that they can do whatever they want. They do not treat Chinese missionaries this way, except for imperialist elements such as Yu Bin. They even talk nonsense, saying, "Chinese people are pigs and cannot be bishops." Then what are they considered as "clergy"?
    A. Now let us first talk about the issue of the Pope. Understanding the issue of the Pope will also help us understand the issues of other clergy.
    On the issue of the Pope, let us first examine the origin of the Pope.
    Since Saint Peter, there has been no papal position or the term. The Pope gradually emerged between the fourth and fifth centuries. Before that, all priests above were generally called bishops, and the power of all bishops was completely equal. If there was anything to be decided, it was decided by a collective meeting of bishops. Later, due to the different political and economic conditions of the bishops' residence, the power of the bishops also changed. The bishops of large cities gradually became archbishops. Due to the changes in political and economic development in various regions at that time, among the archbishops, the power of the six archbishops in the six major cities of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Carthage was the highest. Later, because the Roman Empire established two capitals in Rome and Constantinople at the same time, one empire was divided into two emperors to jointly manage the Catholic world. As a result, the six archbishops gradually formed the two archbishops in the two capitals of Rome and Constantinople as the highest power. Later, the Archbishop of Rome called himself Pope, uniting the Catholic world; the Archbishop of Constantinople advocated maintaining the status quo, disagreeing with the opinion of the Archbishop of Rome, and refusing to submit. But the Archbishop of Rome still called himself Pope and called the Catholicism led by the Archbishop of Constantinople the Eastern Schism. This is the origin of the Roman Pope.
    After the establishment of the Roman Pope, what was the situation like? Let's look at the historical facts again. In 898, Roman nobles fought for the papal position in order to rule the people, each electing their own relatives (actually, it was a power grab) to be Pope. As a result, Pope Sergius III and Pope John IX appeared at the same time. At that time, Pope Sergius III was driven out of Rome by the opposition. Later, the noble Theophylaet brought Pope Sergius III back to Rome for reinstatement by force in 904. Pope Sergius III immediately arrested and imprisoned Pope Leo V. In 914-928, the noble lady of Rome, Thedora, sent her lover as Pope John X. The noble Theophylaet also sent the son of her daughter, Marozia, as Pope, that is, John XI. In 955, the Roman noble Alberic used his power to send his sixteen-year-old son to be Pope, that is, John XII. In 964, Pope John XII, fearing the power of Berengar II of Italy, sought help from the German King Otto I in 962. The German King Otto I entered Rome. Later, Pope John XII colluded with Berengar of Italy to oppose the German King Otto. Later, Otto discovered this and returned to Rome with troops, capturing the Italian King Berengar and imprisoning him. John XII fled. The German King Otto then announced the abolition of Pope John XII and established Pope Leo VIII. After the German King Otto left Rome, Pope John XII returned to Rome and gathered the crowd to drive Pope Leo VIII away. The German King Otto heard the news and returned to Rome with troops again. Pope John XII fled again. In 1378-1389, because Pope Urban VI was tyrannical and dictatorial, it caused dissatisfaction in many countries. In the same year, Queen Joanna of Italy established Pope Clemens VII.
    Because the papal position was fought for in this way, there were often two or three popes existing at the same time. For example, in 1309-1377, for nearly seventy years, due to the struggle for power between the popes of France and Italy, the phenomenon of the coexistence and confrontation of two or three popes was well known.
    A. Two popes coexisting at the same time:
    1378-1389 Pope Urban VI resided in Rome.
    1378-1394 Pope Clemens VII resided in Avignons, France.
    B. Three popes coexisting at the same time:
    1406-1417 Pope Gregorius XII resided in Rome.
    1410-1417 Pope Johanneit XXIII resided in Pisa, northern Italy.
    1394-1424 Pope Benes ctus XIII resided in Avignons, France.
    The above shows that when the Roman regime and the theocracy were combined in the Middle Ages, the authority of the Pope (actually the authority of the emperor) was prevalent in several countries in Western Europe, Germany, France, and Italy. Therefore, the divine position of the Pope also became a tool for the royal nobles to fight for in order to rule the people. The Pope was nominally in a theocratic position in the church, but in essence, he had become a vassal of the royal nobles due to the abduction of feudal rulers. The Papal Court was the royal noble, and the royal noble was the Papal Court, and the two had become one. Therefore, the instructions from the Papal Court were actually the will of the royal nobles. The selection of the Pope's successor was also completely determined by the victory or defeat of the royal nobles' mutual competition for power. Most of those who obtained the papal position were also profligate children and people of bad character. Even a sixteen-year-old child obtained the papal position. There were also fights during the election of the Papal Court, resulting in injuries and deaths. The Popes also took the interests of their backers as their interests, so the Popes sometimes drove each other out and sometimes occupied one side and confronted each other. This formed an extremely chaotic phenomenon of Italian Popes and French Popes.
    Based on this situation, how can it be said that the Pope can never be wrong? Not only can those Popes mentioned above not be said to be free of error, but even Saint Peter cannot be said to be free of error. Jesus said in advance: Saint Peter would betray Jesus three times when the rooster crowed three times. Peter did betray him three times. Then Peter, the great disciple of Jesus, could still be wrong, so why can't the Pope ever be wrong? Some people say that the Pope has the protection of God, so he can never be wrong. Then didn't Jesus foretell Saint Peter three times, wasn't that protection? The Pope not only makes mistakes, but also has countless mistakes in history, and there are also many errors in church doctrine. Leaving aside the distant past, let's just talk about modern history. In 1929, Pope Pius XI said that Mussolini was "a man bestowed by God." Then can it be said that because the Pope blessed Mussolini, Mussolini really came from God? No, who doesn't know now that Mussolini was a murderous demon? In 1933, Pope Pius XII, who was the papal envoy to Berlin, repeatedly instructed German bishops and church members to fully support Hitler. The above are all acts of supporting fascism's massacre of the people and seriously violating the doctrine of universal love. Because of this instruction, I don't know how many lives were lost! Can it be said that the above facts are not the Pope's mistakes? Mistakes do exist. Our responsibility is to recognize and correct our mistakes. We must never conceal our mistakes like the Pharisees.
    B. After understanding the issue of the Pope, let's talk about the general clergy. It must be pointed out here: the imperialist elements in China are not clergy at all. Many church members have always regarded the imperialist elements sent by imperialism to the Catholic Church in China as sacred "clergy." In fact, these people are not clergy at all, but aggressive elements sent by various imperialist countries. Just look at their origins and you will understand. First of all, foreign missionaries came to China to preach, basically dispatched by the governments of various imperialist countries. Coming to China or leaving China was directly handled by the governments of various imperialist countries. This clearly proves their direct relationship with imperialism. The second piece of evidence is that the unequal treaties signed by various countries with China always listed "freedom of missionary work in China" as a major clause. The 1844 Treaty of Wangxia and the 1858 Treaty of Tianjin both expressly stipulate that "China should treat and protect those who preach and practice religion equally and should not harass them."
    In 1860, the Anglo-French Allied Forces occupied Beijing. Britain and France forced the Qing government to add to the treaty. The sixth article of the French treaty originally stipulated "to allow missionaries to preach as before." At that time, the French priest who was acting as a translator privately added the sentence "French missionaries are allowed to rent and buy land and build buildings at will in various provinces." The Qing Emperor was confused and signed the agreement. In 1861, the French government forced the Qing government to give the Catholic Church many privileges. Historically, the harm that imperialism has inflicted on the Chinese people has often been caused by missionary disputes. And in every unequal treaty that China has signed, there have been missionaries who have instigated and plotted to harm China until their goals were achieved. The third piece of evidence is that imperialists competed for the right to protect missionary work in China, and this has caused many disputes. First of all, Portugal obtained the sole right to protect missionary work in the Far East as early as 1454. The bishops in the Far East had to be nominated by Portugal, and the missionary areas of each bishop had to be determined by it, and even the candidates for each bishop were limited to Portuguese priests. Since April 1838, the right to protect Catholicism in China has gradually been taken away by France. Since then, France has manipulated all the activities of Catholic priests in China. Missionaries from various countries who came to China to preach used French passports completely, and any dealings between missionaries from various countries and the Chinese government were handled entirely by the French consulate. After 1878, the German King of the Christian Church was also eager to compete for the right to protect Catholicism in China and gave huge sums of money to support German Catholic priests in China to preach, establishing and expanding his own diocese in Shandong. In 1897, the Big Knife Society killed two German Catholic priests. The German government no longer negotiated through the French Minister in Beijing, but directly stepped in to occupy Jiaozhou Bay, satisfying its ambition to seize colonies for ten years.
    Imperialist elements came to China to preach with evil intentions. Therefore, after arriving in China, they naturally formed a phenomenon of plundering territory and occupying one side. France controlled Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan and other provinces, Italy controlled Shanxi, Belgium controlled Suiyuan and Shaanxi, and Germany controlled Shandong. As a result, Chinese Catholicism was turned into French churches, Italian churches, American dioceses, Belgian dioceses, etc. This division and control between imperialists split Chinese Catholicism into diverse small concessions and small kingdoms of imperialism. Each preached his own "religion" and carried out aggressive activities for his own government. They all used the Gospel of Christ to cover up their beastly faces.
    The looting of Beijing by the imperialists in the Gengzi Year (1900) was mainly launched and directed by Bishop Alphonse Favier (French), who had been in Beijing North Church for forty years. At that time, the Beijing court had cash worth 300 million marks, which was looted. During my childhood, my uncle Zhang Daxing (now over seventy years old, he was a carpenter in Beijing in the Gengzi Year) often told me: "The royal family has countless treasures, but Bishop Favier asked people to rob them in the Gengzi Year...Priests and seminarians all participated, carrying, hugging, and using baskets. Some were so tired that they vomited blood...China was completely impoverished." To this day, it is still circulated among church members: "Bishop Favier robbed too many treasures, and he remitted a lot to France, but he couldn't use it all. Later, Bishop Lin Maode (French) used the remaining money to buy church members. Anyone who joined the church was given six silver dollars." Therefore, church members changed the first paragraph of the "Catechism": "Why did you join the church, to respect God..." to "Why did you join the church, I did it for six Beiyang silver dollars." In eastern Hebei, it was circulated: "Why did you join the church, I did it for five Beiyang silver dollars. I don't want those standing people." ("Beiyang" and "standing people" refer to silver dollars at that time). Therefore, there was one person in Zhuoxian who received baptism five times, and there were many people in eastern Hebei who received baptism two or three times. To this day, this saying is still circulating on the lips of church members in Hebei Province. In order to reward Favier for his meritorious service in invading China, the French government specially named Road No. 27 in the French Concession of Tianjin Favier Road (Rue de Favier), which is now Xinhua South Road. This shows how tragic Favier's robbery of Beijing was. The Qing Emperor gave each of the church members who died in the Gengzi Year a pension of 200 taels of customs silver (this number is not accurate), but 80% of the pension was stolen and remitted to France by missionaries who "loved people as themselves and were dedicated to preaching."
    Church funds have also been stolen by them. In 1932, the French Bishop Fu Chenggong of Beijing stole 500,000 yuan from the Beijing Catholic Church and remitted it to France. The French government specially awarded him a medal. It is well known that the "French Hospital" on Dongjiaomin Lane in Beijing. After the property was sold this spring, Chinese priests learned from the contract that it was the property of the Beijing Catholic Church. But it was stolen and sold by French nun Debiximeng, and all the money was taken back to France. On July 26, the French government specially awarded her the Knight's Cross Medal to show its award. The following telegram is good evidence: "Agence France-Presse, Paris, July 26: Schumann awarded some medals to French missionaries, both male and female, who recently returned from China at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday. He awarded the National Cross Medal to French Bishop Wen Guibin (Jean De Vienne) of Tianjin, the Knight's Cross to Molinari of the Tianjin Mission Society, and Sister Debizemont, the director of the French Hospital in Beijing, and the French Gratitude Medal to Sister Duchene of the French Hospital in Tianjin."
    Some people may ask this: "Doesn't Canon Law 2346-2347 explicitly stipulate that anyone who embezzles church funds will be deprived of his divine authority and punished with abandonment? Wen Guibin, Fu Chenggong, and others are archbishops, don't they know the Canon Law?" They are fully aware of it, but what they are even more aware of is that the Pope, divine authority, and Canon Law cannot control them. Therefore, not only were they not immediately deprived of their divine authority and punished with abandonment, but they were also awarded the Knight's Cross Medal by the French government.
    This large group of so-called "clergy" who ruled the Catholic Church did not talk about any divine cultivation at all. Chinese priest He Wensheng said it right: "Most of these foreigners are unemployed hooligans from their own countries. Their governments have given them detective tasks, so they will naturally do whatever they want when they come to China." If we Chinese Catholics regard them as "angels" and worship them, it is too wrong.
    These imperialist elements are all "Pharisees" denounced by Jesus. Look at how Jesus denounced the sins of the Pharisees!
    "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer; therefore you will receive greater condemnation. ... For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him a son of hell, twice as much as yourselves....For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. ...
    For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.
    So also you outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
    Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers! You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?" (Matthew Chapter 23)
    3. The issue of divine authority
    Many Catholics blindly follow imperialist elements because they are afraid of being punished by divine authority. In fact, divine authority is just a tool played by imperialist elements.
    First of all, the power of divine authority has a scope. According to church doctrine, the power of divine authority is to administer the sacraments and assist church members in respecting God and saving souls. It has no power to determine sins, doctrines, or laws. Because: First, these sins currently defined by foreign missionaries are not found in the Bible. The Bible should be used as a criterion for sins and doctrines, and individuals cannot arbitrarily define them. Second, where does the Bible stipulate that these imperialist elements' divine authority has such omnipotence that it can almost turn the world upside down and is unparalleled? Divine authority has a certain scope of authority. Arbitrarily defining doctrines, sins, and laws according to personal wishes, is this asking people to obey God or to obey imperialism? Now this is also a sin, and that is also schism. These foreign missionaries are simply above God. Arbitrarily defining doctrines and laws according to personal wishes and judging people as guilty is actually a thought of "those who obey me will live, and those who disobey me will die." It is an authoritarian thought that subordinates everyone to personal rule. Arbitrarily judging people as guilty according to personal wishes is definitely saying that the judged person is indeed innocent, and the person who judges people as guilty is the one who is guilty. The crime is: "This is indeed a shameless infringement on the power of God, because only he can determine the fate of criminals and innocent people, the fate of the guilty and the innocent."
    Abusing divine authority and arbitrarily defining sins is wrong. Let me give a historical example. In 1633, Galileo Galilei, the world's leading physicist and astronomer, proved that the Earth was round and revolved around the Sun. The Roman Pope condemned Galileo with the great sins of "heresy and going to hell" and imprisoned him in the Papal Court Tribunal for eight years. Now it has been completely proven that the Earth is indeed round and revolves around the Sun. So, can it be said that because the Roman Pope mistakenly judged it to be heresy, Galileo went to hell? No, Galileo only suffered eight years of unjust imprisonment. From this, it can be seen that any person with divine authority who arbitrarily judges a person as guilty and going to hell is also invalid.
    Catholics will think of this if they think about it casually. The imperialist elements who used missionary work as a protective charm have defined so many sins that turn right and wrong upside down that they are countless. "Opposing Austin's slander" is considered apostasy and should go to hell. "Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea" is also a sin. What is particularly laughable is that Wen Guibin warned the church member Wu Kezhai (Director of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Promotion Association): "Don't talk about loving the church. If you talk about loving the church, you will oppose imperialism. If you oppose imperialism, you will oppose foreigners. Jesus is a foreigner." Please see, opposing imperialism has also become a sin. We are followers of Jesus and good citizens who love the motherland and the people. We not only do not oppose all foreigners, but also always advocate friendly cooperation between the people of all countries. We only oppose imperialist elements. Of course, in the eyes of imperialists, we are guilty. In the past, Japan scolded us patriotic anti-Japanese people as bandits. What is the difference between this and Wen Guibin's slander of us?
    Let me give a few more examples. In the past, they also said that Sun Yat-sen was a demon, and they were not allowed to bow to Sun Yat-sen's statue, they were not allowed to attend coeducational schools, and they were not allowed to participate in any patriotic activities such as "May 1st," "May 30th," and "January 28th." Even when Mr. Wu Kezhai's father was learning to do business, he was said by the Dutch priest to have committed the great sin of going to hell. Now they scold people for the theory of human evolution from apes and scold materialism. This is the same as scolding Galileo's theory at that time. In short, they oppose all social progress. Their proposition is only three words: "Backwards." Their view of human society is that the more conservative the better, otherwise they will not become human beings. When the facts have been clarified and cannot be denied, they immediately say the opposite: "I have long admitted that the Earth is round, and I have long advocated coeducation." And they vigorously promoted Galileo as a Catholic scientist. Archbishop Libri also said in the booklet "The Origin of Man" published by the Shanghai Catholic Diocesan Association: "I don't object to the theory that humans evolved from apes." The Tianjin Jin Gu University special agent Bu Xiangxian (French, already in custody) also shouted that he was an evolutionist and materialist.
    The doctrines of Catholicism cannot be arbitrarily defined. The doctrines are to love God and love people, and love for God should be specifically expressed as "love your neighbor as yourself." Let us use this measure to measure the words and deeds of foreign missionaries in China.

    帝国主义分子是法利赛人的党徒，天主教的死敌
    天津市天主教革新运动促进会副主任委员  张羽时
    甲、是天主教徒团结自救的时候了
    南京军管会九月四日把摩纳哥侨民黎培里驱逐出境了，这是一件大快人心的事情。黎培里是在中国操纵天主教的最主要人物，也是一个证据确凿的以中国人民为敌的帝国主义分子，他是十足的为耶稣所憎恨的法利赛人的党徒。人们只要看一看他的行为，就可以知道他是败坏天主教的叛逆了。他原是梵蒂冈教廷派驻蒋匪政府的“公使”，于一九四六年十二月十四日来到中国。在解放战争期间，黎培里为配合蒋匪反人民的战争，公然宣称要以天主教辅助蒋介石匪帮的“建国工作”，并乘飞机到东北、北京、太原等各重要教区布置其反人民的活动。于一九四八年八月，他调爱尔兰籍神甫莫克勤（William    A．McGrath）来华，到天津、广州、桂林、重庆等地，发展“圣母军”组织，美其名为“专为恭敬圣母”，实际是进行反人民的阴谋活动，包括搜集情报和组织恐怖活动。他们到处造谣，如说：“美军年底就来了，你们大胆的干吧”，“这是魔鬼的世界，赶快求圣母把魔鬼赶走吧”，又宣传“原子弹”、“三次世界大战”，以及“圣母在美军上空显圣”等等。他们煽动与挑拨教友“至死不与人民政府合作”；他们并组织青年，秘受军训，参加“反共游击队”。天津“圣母军”指导司铎荷兰人满济世与王克明等曾誓酒结盟，阴谋暗杀爱国教徒天津天主教革新运动促进会主任委员吴克斋等。正当天津教友群情激愤控诉“圣母军”罪恶的时候，黎培里又以大主教神权资格，号召教徒“为圣母军而致命者可直路升天”（“致命”即“殉教”，应读作为帝国主义致命，升帝国主义的“天堂”），即仍以欺骗伎俩，驱使教友为其效死。
    黎培里的一切反动行为，是在“超政治”的伪装下进行的，但他怎样也不能自圆其说的。一九四九年春天津解放之初，黎培里曾转来梵蒂冈教廷指令，认为“穿灰制服”也是“下地狱的大罪”。这不是“超政治”，而是“超”乎寻常地干涉中国的“政治”了。天津主教文贵宾（法国人，已被驱逐出境）更抄袭了他的衣钵，扩而大之，把上南开大学读书的人也认为该下地狱了。黎培里对我们的一切正义的爱国行动，都采用了最毒辣的威胁手段，滥用所谓“神权”，压迫教内的爱国活动。动辄以“摘神权”，威吓爱国的主教、神甫；以“裂教”、“下地狱”、“被弃绝”镇压爱国的教友。在解放后，香港、上海、天津、广东等地以天主教名义印发了反动书籍数百种，如“怎样对付共产党”、“原子弹与宇宙精神”、“圣而公教会”等这些都是反历史，反科学，歪曲教义，反人民反政府的反动书籍。其中以黎培里直接指挥的上海天主教教务协进委员会为掩护出版印行的反动书籍，即有三十余万册，其中有极反动的“学习参考”。他并指使天津教区主教文贵宾（Jean    De    Vienne）起草了一个“天主教中国全体主教的声明”，散发全国，图借“公使”地位，胁迫各地主教签名，以施行其破坏我们的三自革新运动的目的。
    天主教内有帝国主义分子，而且他们在许多地方利用了天主教进行反革命活动，这是人所共知的事实了。除黎培里之外，例子还很多。如美国间谍雷震远（Ramond    de    Jaeghei），是比籍在华传教的司铎，亦受黎培里的指示与资助，在华北组织“公教青年报国团”和“民众建国协进会”。“公教青年报国团”在华北五省二市建立了组织，为蒋介石进行“策反”“搜集情报”和“暗杀”，曾在平山谋刺人民领袖。
    “公教青年报国团”共分四个大队，由二十五个神甫分担各队指导司铎。又如天津捕获的津沽大学卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦（均系法国人）等间谍分子，他们暗藏电台，与敌通报。八月十八日北京军管会公布的谋刺人民领袖的美国间谍分子马迪懦也是易县主教，并且是黎培里的“北京代表”。在黎培里指使下放走绥远集宁教区的七个与日本有来往的汉奸分子的，就是广东梅县天主教的美国间谍福尔德。此外如河北献县、沈阳、齐齐哈尔、焦作、北京、广东梅县等地发现的间谍案子还很多。所有这些例子都对我们广大爱国的天主教友提出一个迫切的问题：这些法利赛匪徒，盘据着天主教的领导地位，利用天主教危害我们祖国，也危害了天主教本身，我们能够再容忍下去吗？
    乙、天主教友中几个思想问题
    毫无疑问，善良的天主教徒，是不愿被帝国主义分子——法利赛人利用的。但是当隐藏在教内的帝国主义特务间谍分子，一再被捕获，他们已把天主教闹得这样乌烟瘴气的时候，为什么我们许多教友仍不能坚决站起来反对教内的帝国主义分子——法利赛人的党徒，使天主教和帝国主义脱离关系，展开自立革新运动呢？这主要因为教友们长期在帝国主义分子欺骗压迫下，产生了许多错误观点和顾虑。
    有那些顾虑呢？
    首先，不明白教友应不应当爱国。其次，是许多教友已往总认为神长（神甫以至教宗）的话，绝对不能错，亦不敢怀疑，认为稍一怀疑，即犯了下地狱的大罪。第三，怕反对教内帝国主义分子即被认为叛教，裂教，怕神权的镇压。现在我就来谈谈这三个问题。
    一、爱国与信仰问题
    有些天主教友之所以不肯反对帝国主义，不肯参加自立革新运动，自以为是因为信仰问题。
    但是事实是否如此呢？
    我想大家都会记得，在解放以前，以黎培里为首的帝国主义分子们，对共产党的谩骂，与国民党的腔调，还有两样吗？如说，共产主义社会是畜类，不是人等。而今共产党领导全国人民，建设国家，改善人民生活的事实，完全证实了他们是诬蔑。但他们又改换了新的挑拨口号说：“共产党一切都好，就是不信神，共产党与信神的誓不两立，因此必须与共产党干到底。”
    让我们再拿事实来看吧。共产党不信神是真的。如果说共产党与信神者誓不两立，为何回佛等教，仍然健在呢？
    信仰问题，各有自由，谁也没有强迫谁的权利，这是共同纲领明文规定了的。事实已证明，共产党遵守了共同纲领。相反的，以黎培里为首的帝国主义分子们，却无时不在叫嚣“反共”，妄图破坏人民对中国共产党和人民政府的信任，煽动叛乱，离间各民主党派和人民的团结，挑拨中苏友谊，进行间谍活动，这不仅是极尽诬蔑挑衅之能事，且严重地违犯了共同纲领，与全国人民为敌的。北京南堂刘福栋神甫在某次神甫座谈会上说：“假使我们当了权，我们早把共产党杀光了。天主教这样‘反共’，而共产党对我们怎样了呢？”这段话是具有良心的，而且完全符合事实。
    帝国主义分子又说了：“我们的教友可以爱国，但是不能爱共产党的国家。”这同样的是自欺欺人的狡赖。请掀开帝国主义者来华传教史来看吧。由帝国主义传教士参与的一八四四年望厦条约，一八五八年的天津条约，特别在一九○○年八国联军之役，他们策划和参与了许多侵略中国的活动，煽动中国教徒到处发生纷扰，一心陷我中华民族于亡国奴的境地。那么在那时代，也因为中国有了共产党吗？！在过去“五卅”，“九一八”，“一二八”等每次的爱国运动里，他们都是用了“革命，活魔鬼”这样的恫吓诬蔑，对我们教友施行了镇压的。这说明问题的中心，不是因为共产党的国家，才不准我们爱祖国，更不是因为共产党不信神，而是他们不能继续在中国继续侵略和压迫了，所以他们要与共产党也就是中国人民誓不两立。但我们中国教徒为什么还受他们的欺骗？
    帝国主义分子又欺骗我们说：“宗教的世界观，是唯心主义的，共产党是唯物主义的，共产党与天主教徒没有共同的基础。”这纯系无耻的挑拨。其目的就是不叫我们爱国。我们仔细研究共同纲领，在信仰问题上，我们与共产党各有自由，但在许许多多其他的问题上，大家对于祖国都有共同责任，必须团结起来一致努力。我们与共产党的世界观虽然不同，但我们都是中国人，都有责任爱祖国，都要反对封建、买办、法西斯主义思想，都要反对帝国主义者对我祖国的侵略，都要为中国的独立、民主、和平、统一、富强而斗争。我们能欢迎帝国主义侵略我们的祖国，欢迎帝国主义用原子弹炮火炸死朝鲜、越南、印尼等国家被压迫的人民吗？我们能相信帝国主义分子的话，去推翻和平、仁爱、人民自主的世界，去欢迎帝国主义的统治吗？
    我们爱祖国，不但是因为我们自己生长在中国，我们的祖先在中国，我们的子孙也将居住在中国，更因为今日的中国，已经是人民自己的中国，和已往的中国已有本质的不同了。毛主席领导的人民中国，给我们粉碎了国内封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫，及国外帝国主义给予我们百年来的侵害。解放后的建设成就，是伟大而惊人的。十二年来无法解决的通货膨胀和物价飞涨的局面，也已经克服了。土匪已被肃清，人民生活安定了。全国铁路公路畅通无阻，从满洲里可以直达广西。全国土地改革已近完成，农民摆脱了封建地主的压迫与剥削，因而提高了生产积极性，粮食和棉花的生产已接近了战前水平。淮河根治今年已得伟大成就。灾荒、失业和各种疫病的克服，也有惊人的成绩。工农的文化教育也有很大的进步。已往中国的任何政府，是没有也不可能给人民做出这样多的事来的。中国人民还有更大的胜利，是抗美援朝，在朝鲜人民合作之下，已在朝鲜击败了美帝国主义，从而保卫了我们祖国。由于这些胜利，不仅证明我国空前强大，而且国际地位和威信也提高了。解放后这样短短的二三年，就有这样伟大成就，未来的远景是更美丽的。全国的人民，已紧密地团结到毛主席的周围，对政府抱有无限的信赖。那么，我们有什么理由，听信帝国主义分子的挑拨，要推翻这样的美好的国家呢？
    信仰天主与反对帝国主义，并不矛盾，爱国和爱教，应是一致的。如果一谈反对帝国主义，就认为是反信仰，那简直就是说他信仰的是帝国主义，把天主亦和帝国主义不分了，这还不是帝国主义分子对天主莫大的凌辱吗？凡是一个纯洁的信仰者，如果他爱教，他一定更热爱他的祖国，热爱人民，爱和平，爱民主，坚决反对帝国主义给予人类的灾害。因为只有这样才能吻合博爱的教义。我们坚决与帝国主义斩断关系，自由愉快地热爱我们的天主，在毛主席领导之下与全国人民携起手来，共同为建设新中国而奋斗。我们是好国民，也就是好教友，这是天经地义的真理。教友们对此不应有任何怀疑。
    二、神长问题
    中国教友们从来就受蒙蔽，总认为教宗、大主教、主教、神甫在一切方面都不会错，特别是教宗更绝对不会错。教友们只许盲从，不许对神长有任何疑问。帝国主义分子之所以十分强调地这样说，主要目的是要教徒们盲从教宗和外国传教士，使他们能为所欲为；对于中国传教士，除于斌等帝国主义分子而外，他们并不是这样看待的。他们甚至于胡说，“中国人是猪，不能做主教。”那还当成什么“神长”呢？
    甲、现在让我们首先来谈教宗问题。教宗是最高的神长，明白了教宗问题，对于其他的神长问题也就可以明白了。
    在教宗问题上，让我们先来考查一下教宗的来历。
    自圣伯多禄开始，根本没有教宗这个权位和这个名词。自四五世纪之间，才逐渐有了教宗。在这之前，神甫以上，通称为主教，所有主教权势，完全平等，有事由主教集议决定；嗣后因主教驻在地的政治经济条件的不同，主教在权势上也就起了变化，大城市的主教逐渐成了大主教。因当时各个地区政治经济的发展变化、大主教中又逐渐以罗马（Rome），君士坦丁堡（Constantinople），亚立山大（Alexa    ndria），安提亚（Antioch），耶露撒冷（Jerusalem），迦太基（Carthage）六个大城市的六个大主教权势为最高。后因罗马帝国在罗马与君士坦丁堡同时建立了两个首都，一个帝国分成东西两个帝王共同管理天主教的天下。由此又由六个大主教，逐渐形成以驻罗马和君士坦丁堡两个首都的两个大主教的权势为最高了。后来罗马大主教自称为教宗，一统天主教的天下；君士坦丁堡大主教则主张维持原状，不同意罗马大主教的意见，不肯就范。但罗马大主教仍自称为教宗，并称君士坦丁堡大主教所领导的天主教为东方裂教。这就是罗马教宗的来源。
    罗马教宗成立以后，情形又是怎样呢？再让我们看一看历史的事实。在八九八年，罗马贵族为统治人民，纷争教宗权位，各选各的亲近（实际是强权掠夺）去当教宗，因而同时有教宗塞尔若三世（Sergius  Ⅲ）及教宗若望九世（Johannes  Ⅸ）两位同时出现。当时教宗塞尔若三世被反对派驱出罗马。嗣后贵族赛菲莱特（Theophylaet）于九○四年以强权又将教宗塞尔若三世叫回罗马复职。教宗塞尔若三世即将教宗良第五世（Leo  Ⅴ）拘捕下狱。在九一四——九二八年罗马贵族夫人赛都瑞（Thedora）派其情人为教宗若望第十（Johannes  Ⅹ）。贵族赛菲莱特又派其女玛老齐亚（Marozia）之子为教宗，即若望第十一（Johannes  Ⅺ）。在九五五年罗马贵族亚尔伯克（Alberic）以其权势，将其十六岁的儿子派去当了教宗，即若望第十二（Johannes  Ⅻ）。在九六四年教宗若望十二世（Johannes  Ⅻ）因畏惧意大利伯尔戛（Berengar  Ⅱ）的权势，于九六二年求援于德王奥托一世（Otto  the  Great）。德王奥托一世进罗马，嗣后教宗若望十二又与意大利伯尔戛合谋反对德王奥托，后被奥托发觉，奥托回兵罗马，擒意王伯尔戛下狱，若望第十二逃走。德王奥托遂宣布废弃教宗若望第十二世，立教宗良第八世（Leo  Ⅷ）。德王奥托离罗马后，教宗若望第十二返回罗马，又集众将教宗良第八世驱走。德王奥托闻信，又回兵罗马，教宗若望第十二又逃走。在一三七八——一三八九年因教宗吴尔巴六世（Urbanus  Ⅵ）暴戾专政，引起很多国家不满，同年又由意大利女王尤娜（Joanna）立教宗格来孟七世（Clemens  Ⅶ）。
    因为教宗的权位是这样被人争来争去的，因此常常就有两三个教宗同时存在的事实。例如在一三○九——一三七七年将近七十年的时间，因法意两国教宗争权，二三个教宗并存对峙的现象，是世所周知的。
    甲、两个教宗同时并存者：
    1378——1389年教宗吴尔巴六世（Urbanus  Ⅵ）驻罗马。
    1378——1394年教宗格来孟七世（Clemens  Ⅶ）驻法国Avignons城。
    乙、三个教宗同时并存者：
    1406——1417教宗格来高十二世（GregoriusⅫ）驻罗马。
    1410——1417教宗若望二十三世（JohanneitⅩⅩⅢ）驻意国北部比撒（Pisa）城。
    1394——1424年教宗伯乃第第十三世（Benes  ctus  ⅩⅢ）驻法国Avignons城。
    以上说明中世纪罗马政权教权合一的时候，教宗权威（实际是帝王的权威）几遍于西欧德法意几个国家，因而教宗神位，亦成了王室贵族为统治人民必争的工具。教宗在名义上是教会的神权地位，实质上已因封建统治者的劫持，变成了王室贵族的家臣了。教廷就是王室贵族，王室贵族就是教廷，二者已结合成一体了。因此来自教廷的指令，实际就是王室贵族的意旨。教宗的继任人选，也完全决定于王室贵族权势互相角逐的胜败。得教宗位者，亦多纨袴子弟，品行不端的人，甚至以十六岁的小孩子即得了教宗位。教廷选举，亦时有殴打，以致杀伤人命。教宗又各以自己后台的利益为利益，因而教宗与教宗间，时而互相驱逐，时而各据一方，分庭抗礼。形成了意国教宗、法国教宗等极端混乱现象。
    根据这种情况，怎样能说教宗绝对不能错呢？不但是上述那样的教宗不能说不会错，就是圣伯多禄也不能说不会错。耶稣事先说过：圣伯多禄在鸡鸣三遍的时候，要叛耶稣三次。伯多禄果然叛了三次。那么耶稣的大徒弟伯多禄还能错，为什么教宗就绝对不能错呢？有人说教宗有天主默佑，故此绝对不能错。那么耶稣事先嘱告了圣伯多禄三次，还不是默佑吗？教宗不仅有错误，而且在历史上有难以数计的错误，在教义上也有不少错误。远者不论，仅从近代史来讲。一九二九年教宗比约第十一说墨索里尼“是天主所赏赐的人”。那么能说教宗对墨索里尼这一祝圣，墨索里尼就真的自天主而来吗？不会的，而今谁还不知墨索里尼是杀人魔王？一九三三年教宗驻柏林圣使帕赛利即当今教宗比约第十二，一再指令德国主教和教友全力支持希特勒。以上均是赞助了法西斯主义对人民的残杀、严重地违犯博爱的教义。由于这个指示，不知死了多少人命！能说上述的事实不是教宗的错误吗？错误是有的，我们的责任是认识与改正我们的错误，我们决不能像法利赛人一样掩饰自己的错误。
    乙、教宗问题明白之后，我们再来谈一般的神长。这里必须指出：在中国的帝国主义分子根本不是什么神长。许多教友从来就把帝国主义派来中国天主教内的帝国主义分子作为神圣的“神长”。其实这些人并不是什么神长，而是各帝国主义国家派来的侵略分子。只要看一看他们的来历就明白了。首先，外国传教士到中国传教，基本上就是由各个帝国主义政府派遣的，到中国来或离开中国，由各帝国主义政府直接处理。这就明白地证明了他们和帝国主义的直接关系。第二个证据，在各国对中国的不平等条约上，总把“在华传教自由”列为主要一条，一八四四年（道光二十四年）的望厦条约，一八五八年（咸丰八年）的天津条约等均明文载订“中国对传教习教之人，当一体矜恤保护，毋得骚扰”。
    一八六○年（咸丰十年）英法联军占据北京，英法强迫满清政府增订条约。法约第六约原议“仍准教士传教”，当时充翻译的法国教士私添“法国传教在各省租买田地、建造自便”一句，清帝昏?糊涂，签字承认。一八六一年（咸丰十一年）法国政府硬逼满清政府给天主教许多特权。历史上帝国主义给中国人民的侵害，有不少是借口传教纠纷而引起的。而中国每次签订的不平等条约，又都有传教士怂恿划策，不达陷害中国之目的不止。第三个证据，帝国主义者都争夺在华传教保护权，还因此引起了不少的争吵。首先是葡萄牙自一四五四年即获得了远东传教唯一的保护权，远东主教，要由葡萄牙提名，各主教传教区要由它规定，甚至各主教人选仅限于葡籍教士。自一八三八年四月，在华天主教保护权，才逐渐由法国夺去。此后，法国操纵了在华天主教士的一切活动，各国传教士到中国传教，完全用法国护照，各国传教士对中国政府有所交涉，也完全由法国领事馆办理。在一八七八年以后，耶稣教的德国国王，也急于争夺在华天主教保护权，并出巨款，扶持德国天主教士在华传教，在山东树立和扩张了自己的教区。一八九七年（光绪二十三年）大刀会杀德天主教士二人，德政府不再经由法驻北京公使交涉，直接出面强占胶州湾，满足了十年来争夺殖民地的野心。
    帝国主义分子来华传教，居心不良，因此来华后，很自然地形成了掠夺地盘，各据一方的现象。法国把持河北、江浙、云南等省，意大利把持山西，比国把持绥远、陕西，德国把持山东。这一来，中国的天主教，就被弄成了法国教堂，意国教堂，美国教区、比国教区等。帝国主义者之间的这种分割把持，就把中国的天主教区分裂成了多样的小租界与帝国主义的小王国。各传各的“教”，各为各的政府进行侵略活动。他们都以基督福音掩盖着他们的兽面獠牙。
    庚子年帝国主义者对北京的洗劫，主要是留京四十年的北京北堂樊国梁主教（Alphonse    Favier法国人）发动与指导的。当时北京宫廷藏有价值等于三万万马克的现金，被掠劫一空。在我幼年时代，我的伯父张大兴（现年七十余岁，庚子年他在北京作木匠工人）常和我讲：“皇家说不清有多少珍宝，庚子年樊主教让人给他抢……神甫修道生都参加了，背、抱、用筐抬，有的累吐了血……中国那一下就穷透了气。”至今教友间尚流传着：“樊主教抢的珍宝太多了，汇往法国很多，还用不清，嗣后林茂德主教（法国人）用余钱收买教徒，凡入教者，给洋六元。”因此教友把“要理本”第一段：“你为什么进教、为恭敬天主……。”也改为“你为什么进教，我为六块北洋造。”冀东流传的是：“你为什么进教，我为五块北洋造，不是站人的我不要。”（“北洋造”及“站人”均指当时银元）因此涿县竟有一人领五次洗者，冀东一人领二三次洗者亦为数不少。到如今这段话，仍流传在河北省教友的嘴边。法国政府为嘉奖樊国梁侵略中国有功，特将天津法租界二十七号路，定名为樊国梁路（Rue    de    Favier），即今之新华南路。足见樊国梁对北京的抢劫是多么惨重。庚子年教徒死难者，清帝每人给恤金海关银二百两（此数不确），但恤金十分之八，已被“爱人如己，专为传教”的传教士，盗汇法国。
    天主教教款也被他们盗走过。一九三二年北京法国人富成功主教将北京天主堂的五十万元盗汇法国。法政府特奖予勋章。尽人皆知的北京东交民巷“法国医院”，今春财产卖出后，中国神甫才从契约上知道是北京天主堂的财产。但就这样被法国修女德比西蒙盗卖，款银全部带回法国。法国政府于七月二十六日特给以骑士十字勋章，以示奖励。一九五一年春文贵宾将天津教区财产与荷兰人郑化民合谋盗走。于七月二十六日文贵宾与北京法国修女德比西蒙同时领得政府十字勋章。下面的电报，是很好的证据：“法新社巴黎七月二十六日电：舒曼星期四在外交部授予最近由中国归来的法国男女传教士一些勋章。将国家十字勋章授与天津法国主教文贵宾（Jean  De  Vienne），将骑士十字章授与天津遣士会摩利那列（Molinari）以及北京法国医院院长德比西蒙修女（Debizemont），并将法国感谢纪念章授予天津法国医院杜修那（Duchene）修女。”
    可能有人这样问：“圣教法典二三四六条——二三四七条，不是明文载定，凡侵吞教款者，立褫夺其神权，受弃绝罚吗？文贵宾、富成功等是大主教，还不清楚法典吗？”他们完全清楚的，但他们更清楚的是，教宗，神权，法典，都管不着他们。因此他们不但没有被立即摘掉了神权，受了弃绝的处罚，反而荣获了法国政府特奖的骑士十字勋章。
    这一大批统治在天主教头上的所谓“神长”们，根本谈不上什么神修。中国神甫何文升说得对：“这些外国人大部是本国的无业流氓，他们的政府给了他们侦探任务，来中国自然要胡作非为的。”如果我们中国教友把他们当“天使”崇拜，就太冤枉了。
    这些帝国主义分子都是耶稣所指责的“法利赛人”。看看耶稣怎样指责法利赛人的罪状吧！
    “你们这假冒伪善的铎德们有祸了，因为你们侵占寡妇的家产，假意做很长的祷告，所以要受重重的罚。……因为你们走遍了海洋陆地，勾引一个人入教，既入了教，却使作地狱之子，比你们还加倍。……因为你们洗净杯盘的外面，里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。……
    因为你们好像粉饰的坟墓，外面好看，里面却装满了死人的骨头和一切的污秽。
    你们也是如此，在人前外面显出公义来，里面却装满了假善和不法的事。
    你们去充满你们祖宗的恶贯吧！你们这些蛇类，蛇毒之种啊！怎能逃脱地狱里的刑罚呢！”（玛窦圣经第二十三章）
    三、神权问题
    有许多教友之所以盲从帝国主义分子，是因为怕受神权处分。而事实上，神权只是帝国主义分子玩弄的工具。
    首先说神权的权力是有范围的。按教义说，神权的权力，就是施行圣事，协助教友，恭敬天主救人灵魂的职权。它没有权力定罪条，也没权力定教义，定法条。因为：第一，在圣经上并没有现在外国传教士所定的这些罪条。罪条教义要以圣经为准绳，不能由个人私意来乱定。第二，圣经上在什么地方规定了这些帝国主义分子的神权，有这样万能，万能到几乎要翻天筋斗，盖世无双？神权是有它一定职权范围的。随意以个人私愿，胡乱定教义，定罪条，定法条，这是叫人服从天主，还是服从帝国主义？而今这也是罪，那也是裂教，这些外国传教士们简直高于天主之上了。以个人私愿，胡乱定教义，定法条，判人以罪，实际上是顺我者生，逆我者亡的思想，是把天下人都隶属于个人统治之下的独裁思想。以个人私愿，胡乱判人以罪，肯定地说，被判者确实无罪，判人以罪的人，才是有罪的。其罪名为：“这实在是对天主权力的一种无耻的侵害，因为只有他才能决定犯人和无辜者的命运，有罪和无罪者的命运。”
    滥用神权，乱定罪条是错误的。举一个历史上的例子吧。一六三三年世界第一流物理学及天文学家伽利略氏（Galileo    Galilei）证明了地球圆、而且绕日转的学说，罗马教宗曾以“异端邪说、下地狱”的大罪，加给了伽利略，并在教廷裁判院监禁了他八年。而今已完全证明地球确实圆，且绕太阳转。那么能否因着罗马教宗错误地判定是异端邪说，伽利略就下了地狱呢？不能的，伽利略不过仅受八年监禁的冤枉罢了。由此可见，任何有神权的人胡乱判定有罪下地狱也是无效的。
    教友们随意一想就会想起来的，以传教为护符的帝国主义分子们，定的颠倒是非的罪条，已多到不可胜数了。“反奥斯丁谰言”被认为是背教应下地狱。“抗美援朝”也是罪。特别成为笑谈的是，文贵宾警告教友吴克斋（天津天主教革新促进会主任委员）说：“你不要谈爱教，如果谈爱教就要反帝，反帝就要反对外国人，耶稣就是外国人。”请看反对帝国主义也成了罪了。我们是耶稣的信徒，爱祖国爱人民的好公民，不但不反对一切外国人，而且从来主张各国人民间的友好合作的，我们只反对帝国主义分子，当然在帝国主义眼睛里是有罪的。过去日本曾骂我们爱国抗日者是土匪，这与文贵宾对我们的谩骂有什么不同呢？
    让我再举几个实例吧。在过去，他们也说孙中山是魔鬼，不准给孙中山像行鞠躬礼，不准上男女合校的学校，不准参加“五一”、“五卅”、“一、二八”等任何爱国活动。甚至吴克斋先生的父亲学买卖的时候，也曾被荷兰神甫说是犯了下地狱的大罪。现在他们痛骂人是类人猿进化来的学说，痛骂唯物论，这和当时痛骂伽利略的学说是一样的。总之，他们对一切社会进步现象，没有不反对的。他们的主张只有三个字：“开倒车”。他们对人类社会的看法，总认为越保守越好，反此即不成为人了。到了事实已弄明白，无可否认时，他们又立刻反过来说：“我早承认地球是圆的，早主张男女合校。”并大肆宣传伽利略是天主教科学家了。黎培里在上海天主教教务协进会出版的“人类的起源”的小册子上也说：“我不反对人是类人猿进化来的”。天津津沽大学特务卜相贤（法国人，已在押）也大喊他是进化论与唯物论者了。
    天主教的教义是不能乱定的。教义就是爱主爱人，而爱天主要以“爱人如己”为具体表现。我们就用这个尺度来衡量在华外国传教士的言行吧。
    许多外国传教士都支持帝国主义。请问全世界被压迫的人民，究竟犯了什么罪，一定要被奴役，被迫害，被残杀呢？这是教义所能容许的吗？
    然而以黎培里为首的帝国主义分子竟公然说：“签名反对武装日本，即帮助了魔鬼。”“这是魔鬼的世界，念经求圣母吧！原子弹把他们炸光！”他把天主圣母，也描写得这样残忍肮脏，竟求天主圣母保佑着他们烧杀奸淫，把教义变成了残忍好杀的帝国主义思想，并欺骗教友把这些帝国主义侵略思想当教义来信。这是百分之百的对天主圣母的污辱，这是百分之百的天主教的破坏者，他们没一点神权神修的气味了。
    事实上，帝国主义分子自己从来不重视什么“神权”，而只是把它作为统治中国天主教徒的工具。天津主教文贵宾曾一再夸口说：“刚大主教（现已任罗马传信部秘书长）两次亲口告我，叫我离开中国，我不走。”教宗决定北京北堂财产全部拨归中国枢机主教管理，至今法国传教士硬不交出。这还有什么神权呢？一九一二年富成功、文贵宾等四个法国主教曾上书罗马诬蔑中国人愚蠢，没有升主教的资格。因为刚恒毅主教介绍了六个中国人，升了主教，文贵宾等至今仍骂刚主教是“活魔鬼”。张锦华神甫于一九四九年无辜被文贵宾摘掉神权，其母因此抑郁而死。文贵宾经常镇压中国神甫们说：“我一个一个的都制服你们，你们都不是神甫。”但荷兰神甫吃喝豪华，如高德贵、董振国两位神甫与女人通奸，柏恩神甫与萧永新姘靠，严重地违犯了神甫的贞节，文贵宾却置若罔闻。（柏恩是华北圣母军总指导司铎，萧永新年二十余岁，未婚，辅仁大学学生，系柏恩私人秘书，因二人有奸情，萧永新得升任华北圣母军总秘书长，总揽实际全权。）
    丙、坚决开展自立革新运动
    与帝国主义相结合的天主教传教士，是随着帝国主义的大炮到中国来的。在天主福音掩盖下带给了中国民族不堪言状的灾难。中国人是讲仁爱爱好和平的，中国人对于帝国主义的反抗，是付出了数以千万计的生灵代价的。解放后的中国，不能允许帝国主义分子再继续侵害中国人民。但帝国主义分子却在中国继续作恶，他们从事间谍活动，煽动叛乱，夜以继日祝祷的不是实现爱人如己的人民民主的社会，相反的是逼使教友蓄意恢复美蒋的奸盗邪淫、掠夺残杀的万恶的社会。为了便利于侵略，不惜违背信仰，破坏圣教，滥用神权，歪曲教义，侵吞教款。凡利于帝国主义利益者，任何伤天害人的事情，他们都干得出来。请看这还叫有信德吗？他们对圣教会都如此，其对于人民的残忍，更可想而知。总之，翻阅他们来华传教史，全部都是用博爱的教义伪装着杀人的炮火。百年来的事实，证明他们正是耶稣所责斥的法利赛人，天主教的破坏者，我们每个虔诚信友，不能坐视他们这样侵害我们圣教的。法利赛匪徒们，把我们圣教弄到这般田地，我们要圣教，就非把他们剔出去不可，如果仍允许他们存在，则国家和圣教将受他们的严重沾污危害。我们才是耶稣的真诚信徒，天主教圣洁的保持者。坚决铲除毁坏圣教的法利赛人，这也就是我们为什么必须实现自立革新，全面展开反帝爱国爱教运动的道理。
    帝国主义分子又说了：“三自（自治自养自传）即叛教脱离教宗。”“三自是裂教，应下地狱。”
    “反对黎培里即反对教宗。”这和说“反奥斯丁谰言，即叛教”，是同样的荒谬，这是爱帝国主义而不爱国不爱教的谬论。把教义变成了帝国主义，对天主的信仰，变成了信仰帝国主义了。自立革新运动现在还没有在全国普遍展开，就是这种谬论从中作祟。天津李德培神甫说得好：“教宗无权随意定教义定信德的道理……而今教宗的‘反共’‘反民主’，以及不准参加国际妇联、工联等，那是他错误的政治活动，我们不能服从，因这与信仰无关。我们的自立革新运动，就是把教义与帝国主义分开的工作。”
    我们信仰的是天主，不是帝国主义，也不是奴隶主义。我们所信的天主，是不限于任何国家，任何民族的，为什么中国天主教就不能自治自养自传呢？难道天主给了帝国主义分子“版权所有，翻印必究”的特权吗？中国人信天主，必须经帝国主义转手，才是真天主，否则就是假天主吗？为何天主独厚于西欧和美帝国主义，却歧视耶稣所出生的亚洲？果如此则不能称为公教了。
    自立革新，就是教友的反帝爱国爱教的运动。革新对象，就是帝国主义，这和教内本身信仰问题根本不是一件事情。在天津的自立革新运动，中国神甫极力要办，帝国主义分子则百般破坏；中国神甫说这是反帝爱国爱教，教友应做的工作，帝国主义分子硬抵赖说是“裂教下地狱”。一个问题，两种看法，两相对照，问题就很明显。显然，中国神甫们大都愿早日实现自立革新，摘掉自己脖子上套着的枷锁，帝国主义分子则切愿继续它的对中国的侵略。我们必须实现自立革新，清除教内隐藏的帝国主义分子，以免给予国家人民以危害。我们应坚决洗掉法利赛人给圣教的严重污辱。爱国的神长及全体教友紧密团结起来，警惕帝国主义分子对我们内部的挑拨，加强学习，提高政治觉悟，坚决与人民站在一起，对隐蔽在教内的帝国主义分子，揭穿他们的伪善兽心，迫使他们放下侵略中国、朝鲜、越南、印尼及全世界人民的屠刀，把它们抛到十二层地狱里去，恢复我们教的圣洁，胜利完成自立革新。
