    Labor-Management Agreement: The Road to Increased Production and Donation
    The Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has commended the Tianjin Private Hengyuan Textile Factory's approach of increasing production and donation through labor-management agreements and has instructed trade union organizations in various private factories to promote and implement it.
    The Hengyuan Textile Factory's method of increasing production and donation through labor-management agreements aligns with the spirit of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association's call for increased production and donation. The factory's experience demonstrates that implementing labor-management agreements for increased production and donation can ensure the completion of donation payment plans. According to calculations made at a consultation meeting held by labor and management on August 31st, the August donation plan—approximately 130 million yuan—can be fully completed. The factory's experience also proves that labor-management agreements for increased production and donation are a good way to improve production. The original plan for yarn's spindle draft was 0.9152 pounds, but as of the production statistics on August 24th, the yarn's spindle draft had reached 0.946 pounds, greatly exceeding the original plan. Workers in the roving workshop spun an average of eight to nine hanks per person per day, exceeding the May output and nearly doubling the four to five hanks produced during the same period last year.
    Hengyuan Textile Factory's increased production and donation plan for September has been determined: focusing on improving quality, starting with learning and promoting advanced work methods, strengthening statistical inspection systems, and improving machinery. This method of increasing production and donation through labor-management agreements can serve as a reference for private industrial and commercial enterprises in various regions.
