Deeply Mobilizing Workers for Inspection
Is the Key to Unleashing the Potential of the Electricity Industry
Li Yan, Director of the Beijing Electricity Bureau

The People's Daily editorial on August 5, "Fully Unleashing Potential is the Operating Principle of the People's Electricity Industry," pointed out a clear direction for those engaged in the people's electricity industry. In the past, the Beijing Electricity Bureau only understood that relying solely on adding new equipment would not solve the problem of electricity supply, but did not understand that the primary task at present is to unleash the potential of existing equipment. The potential of the Beijing Electricity Bureau is very great. In our recent inspection work, we found that the reason we did not unleash the potential well was because we still had many incorrect ideas on this issue.

        The Idea of Only Focusing on Production and Not on Management,
        Hinders the Unleashing of Potential

First is: the idea of only focusing on production and not on management. As long as the task is completed, it doesn't matter if the work efficiency is high or not. This idea has wasted a lot of the country's property. Since liberation, almost all the distribution transformers that have been burned out have not been repaired; up to now, there are a total of more than 3,000 kVA [Note 1] stored in warehouses and scattered in the yards. Leading cadres didn't know about these situations in the past, and worried every day that there were not enough distribution transformers, only wanting to ask the General Bureau to allocate some to us as backups. However, after discussions with the workers, everyone believed that these transformers could be quickly revived. In this way, it can save the country's investment of about 1.5 billion yuan. Some equipment and materials are idle or have very low utilization rates. For example, in a certain mining area, some distribution transformers have not been used for two or three years, and a 20 kVA transformer only serves a few households for lighting (now a 3 kVA transformer has been replaced). In the Fengtai area, after a preliminary investigation, at least dozens of kVA of distribution transformers can be transferred back. In the past, the utilization rate of distribution transformers in Beijing city was only 22%; however, in order to ensure the highest annual load [Note 2] during the Spring Festival, we did not dare to adjust, thinking, "What if the transformer burns out if we exceed the load?" This conservative thinking has left the capacity of the equipment dormant for a long time, and this loss is serious. After discussion, we are preparing to test the output and rationally adjust the power, and it is expected that there will be a large harvest. The waste of manpower and the phenomenon of work stoppage [Note 3] are also very serious. The outside line work team often had to wait for materials and load the truck every morning, sometimes going out to work at ten or even eleven o'clock, delaying a lot of time; for more than two years, we had never seriously thought of a way to solve it. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party branch of the outside line team studied this issue in detail and submitted it to the enlarged meeting of cadres for discussion, and the fellow workers came up with many solutions. For example: prepare the materials the day before, and let temporary workers load the truck during study time the next day, so that they can go out to work before 9:00. Everyone wrote these methods into the patriotic pact, which is equivalent to adding half a shift to one shift of manpower every day (about 24 people per shift).

    We Must Eliminate Accidents in Order to Unleash Potential

Secondly, our understanding of the business direction of ensuring the supply of safe, uninterrupted, sufficient, and inexpensive power is also gradually becoming clearer. This was always considered impossible under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past. But after we took over this dilapidated industry from the bureaucratic capitalists, we relied on the workers and unleashed their enthusiasm, and we have already made great achievements. For example, more than 100,000 service lines in the city were repaired for a year and finally completed before the 30th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. In the past, hundreds of service lines would be broken in one big wind. But in the heavy rain on July 29 this year, only 33 households in the city had their lines broken. The city's high-voltage lines have also been overhauled. Through the safe power supply competition, accidents have been significantly reduced. However, these achievements are still far from the requirements. In the past, many accidents would occur during the first rain every summer because the transformers were not wiped in time. This year, many accidents still occurred for the same reason. On May 24, due to the rain, the loss of electricity due to accidents was as high as more than 30,000 kWh. After the rain, we put in great efforts to wipe the transformers, and during the second rain, there were no such accidents. Due to the failure to prune tree branches in time, the tree branches broke the power lines during the rainstorm on July 27, and this accident caused a loss of 7,600 kWh of electricity. The purpose of maintenance is to avoid accidents, but some of our cadres lack a high degree of responsibility to the users, do not fully understand the serious damage of power outages to social production and social life, and have a one-sided view of completing maintenance tasks, so that maintenance and power outage plans are disconnected. As a result, accident power outages are reduced, but maintenance power outages are greatly increased, and even the number of maintenance power outages and accident power outages combined is higher than last year. For example, a certain line has already been reported in the newspaper for maintenance power outage, but another work team went to replace the distribution transformer the day before the power outage date, causing more than 100 workers in a factory to stop working for several hours due to lack of electricity.

Our personal accidents and operational errors are constantly occurring, which is the result of some administrative cadres not paying enough attention to the safety of workers' lives and not strictly and thoroughly implementing the regulations and systems. For example, in March this year, a worker in a substation mistakenly went to work on a live oil switch and was electrocuted and injured, resulting in his hand being sawn off and becoming disabled; but on July 30, a similar serious personal accident almost occurred in another substation. On May 3 this year, technician Zhang Guangzhong did not ground the wire during work and accidentally touched the high-voltage line, sacrificing his life; after this bloody lesson, although a series of work has been carried out in terms of safe operation, the cadres do not go deep into the site to conduct detailed inspections, and those who violate safe operation are not dealt with in time; workers still do not ground the wire or wear rubber gloves when working. For example, on August 6, technician Zhang Zhaoxi of the power supervision team used an electric meter to test the load power factor [Note 4], and accidentally short-circuited the power supply [Note 5], burning his face and hands. Operational errors in substations are still serious. For example, duty officer Deng Luzhong did not abide by the regulations and systems, and arbitrarily tested the relay on July 31, resulting in a tripping accident. The dispatching office was established not long ago, and the dispatching system is not strictly enforced, and because the duty officers do not know enough about the on-site situation, they sometimes even issue wrong orders. On August 12, duty officer Yan Tie Zhuang did not let the circuit breaker [Note 6] close, and ordered power generation, causing a major accident.

In terms of unified dispatching, because the phase [Note 8] of the feeder lines [Note 7] of each substation in the city is different, power outage operations must be carried out when the lines are switched. This problem is not difficult to solve, but it has not been seriously addressed for two years since liberation. At the same time, the unplanned power outage maintenance seriously affects the planning of dispatching.

Regarding reducing costs and supplying the people with inexpensive power, some comrades also have conservative ideas that need to be further eliminated. After liberation, we have inventoried the warehouse twice, but there are still 4.5 billion yuan of stagnant materials in the warehouse. Small warehouses have not been completely eliminated, and piles of parts can often be seen scattered on the ground. The budget system has not been improved either. For example, the expenditure on maintenance materials in June this year accounted for only 80% of the budget. Some comrades took the attitude of "the more the better" when receiving items. The internal line division urgently applied for 30 car pockets, but only 15 were taken away after several reminders. We are vigorously promoting the economic accounting system, and many comrades have made sharp criticisms of such waste. In the future, launching a rationalization proposal movement, carefully verifying funds, ensuring cost reduction, and mobilizing mass supervision are necessary measures for us to supply inexpensive power.

Relying on the Assistance of Local Leading Organs and the Enthusiasm of the Broad Masses of Workers, Do a Good Job in the People's Electricity Industry

In addition, in terms of adjusting the load, it is urgently needed to be carried out in the Beijing area. According to the experience of reducing the peak load of lighting time in the first half of the year [Note 9], it proves that this work is entirely possible in our new society. In order to do this work well, we are now preparing various materials. We had serious shortcomings in this work in the past. Due to the lack of investigation and research on the users' electricity consumption, the basis and data for adjusting the load were insufficient, so there was no thorough plan. In the past, we did not seriously seek the leadership and assistance of local leading organs, such as the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, but only "passed it through," which is the result of our lack of a clear understanding of the correct relationship between state-owned enterprises and local leading organs. In the future, we must rely on the leadership or guidance of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal People's Government, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and submit the plan for approval, and obtain their guidance and assistance in the implementation, otherwise, the work will not have any significant results. Facts have proved that any idea of making one's own decisions, claiming to be a "centrally led enterprise" that "does not belong to the city and has nothing to do with the city," or "passing it through" is wrong.

All these serious shortcomings were found out after the enlarged cadre meeting on August 19 and after mobilizing all the workers to seriously study the People's Daily editorial "Fully Unleashing Potential is the Operating Principle of the People's Electricity Industry." The root causes of these phenomena, in addition to the various erroneous ideas mentioned above, are also that the leading ideology is not sufficiently aware of the seasonal regularity of the electricity industry and how to systematically grasp and implement the electricity work policy, and therefore cannot find the focus of work for a period of time. More importantly, our leading cadres have not well implemented the policy of democratic management, the management committee has not fully played the democratic style, and some workers do not know what the management committee is for. Sometimes a worker's rationalization proposal is not answered for two months. This fully shows that the remedial lessons for democratic reform are very necessary in our unit, only in this way can we overcome the problems of bureaucracy and red tape. In order to complete the tasks assigned to us by the country, increase the strength of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, unleash potential, and supply safe, uninterrupted, sufficient, and inexpensive power, we must constantly conduct in-depth inspections and conduct a serious struggle with these incorrect ideas.

    深入发动职工检查工作
    是发挥电业潜在能力的钥匙
    北京电业局局长  李岩
    人民日报八月五日“充分发挥潜在能力是人民电业的经营方针”的社论，给从事人民电业的工作者指出了一个明确的方向。过去北京电业局仅仅了解不能只凭增加新设备来解决电力的供应问题，而不了解当前的首要任务，是发挥现有设备的潜在能力。北京电业局的潜在能力是很大的。在我们最近检查工作中，发现我们所以没有很好发挥潜在能力，是由于在这个问题上我们还有许多不正确的思想。
            只问生产不管经营的思想，
            障碍着潜在能力的发挥
    首先是：只问生产不管经营的思想。只要完成任务就行了，不管工作效率高不高。这种思想给国家浪费了很多的财产。自解放以来，凡是烧坏的配电变压器，基本上是没有修过的；到现在为止，放在库房里，散置在院子里的共计约有三千多千伏安〔注一〕。领导干部过去根本不清楚这些情况，每天发愁配电变压器不够用，只想请总局拨给我们一些作备份。但是，经过职工讨论之后，大家认为这些变压器是很快可以复活的。这样一来，就可节省国家投资约十五亿元。有些设备及器材闲置着不用或利用率很低。如某矿区有的配电变压器两三年不用，有一个二十千伏安的变压器只带着少数几户用灯（现在已换了一个三千伏安的变压器）。在丰台地区，经过初步调查之后，配电变压器至少可以调回几十千伏安。过去北京城内配电变压器的利用率只有百分之二十二；可是，为了保证全年负荷〔注二〕最高的春节时的用电，不敢调整，认为“超过负荷烧了变压器怎么办？”这种保守思想，使设备的能力长期地潜置在那里，这个损失是严重的。经过讨论，准备试验出力，合理调整电力，预计可以有大量的收获。人力的浪费和窝工〔注三〕现象也是非常严重的。外线工作班每天早晨因为等待领料装车，有时要十点甚至十一点出勤，耽误很长时间；两年多从未认真想办法解决。最近外线的中国共产党支部详细地研究了这个问题，提交干部扩大会议讨论，工友同志们就想了许多办法。如：前一天把料备齐，第二天在学习时间由临时工把车装好，九时以前即可出勤工作。大家把这些办法都订在爱国公约里，这样就等于每天增加半个班到一个班的人力（每班约二十四人左右）。
    必须消灭事故，才能发挥潜在能力
    其次，保证供给安全的、不间断的、足够的、廉价的电源的经营方向，我们的认识也是逐渐明确起来的。这在过去国民党反动统治下一向被认为是不可能的事。但我们从官僚资本手里接收了这破烂的产业之后，依靠工人，发挥了工人积极性，已有很大成绩。如全市十万条以上的接户线，修了一年，终于在中国共产党的三十周年的前夕修理完了。过去一次大风，断接户线数以百计。而今年七月二十九日的狂风暴雨中，全市只断了三十三户的线。全市高压线也已检修了一遍。通过安全供电竞赛，事故已显著减少。但是，这些成绩距离要求还是差得很远的。过去每年夏季第一次下雨，因擦变压器不及时，会有许多事故。今年仍然由于同样原因，出了许多事故。五月二十四日下雨，因事故损失电量竟达三万多度。雨过之后就下大力擦变压器，第二次下雨时，这类的事故一次也没有了。由于锯树枝不及时，七月二十七日暴风雨时，树枝压断电线，这次事故竟损失电量七千六百度。检修的目的是避免事故，但是我们有些干部缺乏对用户的高度的责任感，不充分了解停电损失对社会生产和社会生活的严重损害，存在着片面的完成检修任务的观点，使检修与停电计划脱节，因而事故停电少了，但检修停电则大量增加，甚至检修停电与事故停电次数综合起来高过去年。如某路因为检修已登报停电，但另一工作班却于停电日期前一天去换配电变压器，使某工厂一百多工人因无电停工数小时。
    我们的人身事故和错误操作是不断发生的，这是部分行政干部对工人生命安全没有足够的重视，执行规程制度不严格、不深入的结果。如今年三月里某变电站工人误到带电的油开关上作活，触电受伤，以致将手锯掉，成了残废；但七月三十日在另一个变电站，几乎又发生同样严重的人身事故。本年五月三日技工张光中在工作中没有接地线，误触高压线，牺牲了性命；经过这次血的教训以后，在安全作业方面虽然进行了一系列的工作，但是干部不深入现场作细致的检查，对违犯安全作业的人不及时处理；职工工作时不接地线，不带胶手套的情形仍时有发生。如八月六日电力监察组技工张兆禧用电表试验负荷力率〔注四〕，不慎电源短路〔注五〕，将面部及手烧伤。变电站的错误操作是仍然严重的，如值班员邓履中不遵守规程制度，竟于七月三十一日擅自试验继电器，致发生掉闸事故。调度所成立不久，对调度制度执行的也不够严格，并由于值班员对现场情况不够了解，有时甚至发出错误命令，八月十二日值班员阎铁庄未让合断路开关〔注六〕，即命令发电，造成一次重要事故。
    在统一调度方面，由于市内各变电站馈电线〔注七〕相位〔注八〕不一，使线路倒路时必须停电作业。这个问题是不难解决的，但解放后两年来未被认真注意过。同时，停电检修的无计划，严重影响着调度上的计划性。
    关于降低成本，供给人民廉价的电源，有些同志也存在着守旧思想，须要进一步地清除。解放后我们曾两次清点仓库，但现在仍然有四十五亿的呆滞材料放在仓库里。小仓库依然没有彻底消灭，时常可以看到成堆的零件散在地上。预算制度也没有健全起来。如本年六月份的维护材料的支出只占预算的百分之八十。有些同志领用物品抱着“多多益善”的态度，内线股急如星火地申请作三十个车兜子，但做好后催了几次才领去了十五个。我们正在大力推行经济核算制，许多同志对这样一些浪费现象提出了尖锐的批评。今后展开合理化建议运动，认真核定资金，保证降低成本，发动群众监督，是我们供应廉价电源的必要措施。
    依靠地方领导机关的帮助和广大职工的积极性，作好人民电业工作
    此外，在调整负荷方面，在北京地区是急需要进行的。按照上半年对压低照明时间尖锋负荷的经验〔注九〕，证明这件工作在我们的新社会里是完全可能实现的。为了作好这件工作，我们现正准备各项资料。我们过去在这一工作中是有严重缺点的，由于对用户用电情况没有进行调查研究，调整负荷的根据和资料不足，因而没有周密的计划。过去在工作中，没有认真求得地方领导机关，如北京市人民政府及中共北京市委员会的领导及协助，只是“通过一下”，这是我们对于国营企业与地方领导机构正确关系缺乏明确的认识的结果。今后必须依靠中共北京市委、市人民政府及市总工会的领导或指导，并把计划提请批准，在执行中又取得它们的指导与协助，否则，工作是不会有什么显著成效的。事实证明：任何自作主意，自称“中央领导企业”“不属于市，与市无关”，或“通过一下”的思想，都是错误的。
    所有这些严重的缺点，都是在八月十九日扩大干部会议前后，发动全体职工认真学习了人民日报“充分发挥潜在能力是人民电业的经营方针”的社论后检查出来的。产生这些现象的根源，除上面各种错误思想之外，还有就是领导思想对于电业的季节规律性和对如何有系统地掌握和贯彻电业工作方针认识不足，因而也就找不到一个时期的工作重点。更重要的是我们领导干部没有很好地贯彻管理民主化的方针，管理委员会没有充分地发挥民主作风，有些工人不知道管理委员会是作什么的。有时工人的一件合理化建议，拖两个月也不答复。这充分说明民主改革补课在我们这个单位是很需要的，只有这样才能克服事务主义官僚主义的毛病。为了完成国家交给我们的任务，增加抗美援朝的力量，发挥潜在能力，供应安全的、不间断的、足够的、廉价的电源，就必须不断地深入检查并与这些不正确的思想作严肃的斗争。
