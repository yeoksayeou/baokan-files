Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: Concurrent with the conclusion of the separate peace treaty, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is intensifying its efforts to lift the purges of fascist military officers and special agents, among other illegal measures, to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism. On the 7th, the Yoshida government once again announced the derectification of 10,649 former lieutenant colonels (校级) and junior officers (尉级). To date, the total number of fascist officers illegally derectified by the Yoshida government has reached approximately 60,000.

The Yoshida government is currently scouting for candidates from among these derectified officers to work in the core of the new Japanese army, the "Police Reserve Force." According to the Asahi Shimbun on the 9th, the Yoshida government will accept 400 former lieutenant colonels and majors as senior officers of the "Police Reserve Force."

At the same time, in order to intensify the persecution of the Japanese Communist Party and suppress the democratic movement of the Japanese people, the Yoshida government announced on the 8th the lifting of sanctions against 336 wartime "ideological control experts," 304 of whom were the notorious "ideological police," and the remainder were prosecutors and judicial personnel proficient in "ideological cases." As early as the end of August, Yoshida had ordered Takeo Ohashi, the president of the Ministry of Justice, to expand the Japanese intelligence agency "Special Examination Bureau," which is equivalent to the American Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is expected that the number of personnel in the bureau will increase by 600, and many of the derectified special agents will be absorbed to participate in the work of the bureau.

The Yoshida government has been arresting Japanese patriots who are fighting for peace and independence on a large scale. According to a report by the Japanese Police Agency, the number of people arrested for "anti-American activities" was 105 in the first half of last year, but this number increased sharply to 1,733 in the same period this year.

    日本万余法西斯军官和特务
    又被吉田政府非法解除整肃
    上半年近两千日本爱国者被捕
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：和缔结单独和约的同时，日本吉田反动政府正加紧采取解除法西斯军人和特务的整肃等非法措施，以加速复活日本军国主义。七日，吉田政府再次宣布将一万零六百四十九名前佐（校）级和尉级军官解除整肃。到目前为止，先后被吉田政府非法解除整肃的法西斯军官，总数已达六万名左右。
    吉田政府正在这次被解除整肃的军官中，物色人选，使他们在日本新陆军的核心“警察后备队”中工作。据《朝日新闻》九日透露，吉田政府将接受前陆军中佐和少佐级的军官四百人作为“警察后备队”的高级军官。
    与此同时，为了加紧迫害日本共产党和镇压日本人民民主运动，吉国政府又于八日宣布解除三百三十六名战时“思想管制专家”的整肃处分，其中有三百零四名是恶名昭彰的“思想警察”，其余的是擅长于“思想案件”的检查官与司法人员。早在八月底以前，吉田就曾命令法务府总裁大桥武夫将相当于美国联邦调查局的日本特务机关“特别审查局”加以扩大。预料该局人员即将增加六百名，这次被解除整肃的特务，将有许多人被吸收参加该局工作。
    吉田政府已在大批逮捕为和平和独立而斗争的日本爱国者。据日本警察局的报告，因“反美活动”而遭逮捕的人，去年上半年有一百零五人，今年同一时期则激增为一千七百三十三人。
