    Careless Construction Ignores Worker Safety
    Public Bengbu Winery Building Collapse Kills Workers

    To the Editor:
    The leading cadres of the public Bengbu Winery in Bengbu City neglected factory safety equipment, resulting in a building collapse on August 29th, which killed four workers and injured four workers. The six collapsed rooms were repaired last December by the former factory director, Wang Qiyuan. At that time, Wang Qiyuan found workers without construction skills through personal connections, and the building was not inspected after completion, so the building was very unstable. In March of this year, the gable of the house cracked outwards, and the factory only used a few rails to prop up the wall. The factory safety and hygiene inspection team organized by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Labor Protection Department, the Municipal Labor Bureau, and other units raised opinions to the factory director Xu Gan, stating that the house was dangerous and should be repaired quickly. In April, the factory submitted a report to the superior management agency for approval to carry out repairs; however, because the leading cadres of the factory completely ignored worker safety, the repair of the house was put on hold because the ownership of the house was not determined (the local court wanted this house, and it was not until early July that the Northern Anhui Administrative Office approved the house to be returned to the winery). Moreover, for business purposes, this house, which was originally used as a warehouse, was converted into a production site (distilling wine). After a few days of heavy rain in August, six rooms collapsed together on the morning of August 29th. Nine workers were working in the house at the time. One person died on the spot, three died in the hospital, and four were seriously injured and are still being treated in the hospital. The local relevant authorities are seriously handling this matter. The attitude of the leading cadres of the factory towards construction projects before and after was wrong, and they seriously ignored worker safety, which caused this serious incident. This should be brought to the attention of all localities.

    建筑工程潦草忽视工人安全
    公营蚌埠酒厂房塌砸死人编辑同志：
    蚌埠市公营蚌埠酒厂领导干部忽视工厂安全设备，八月二十九日发生房屋倒塌砸死工人四人、砸伤工人四人的事件。倒塌的房子六间，是去年十二月份由前任厂长王启元经手修盖的，当时王启元是通过私人关系找的没有建筑技术的工人，而且盖好以后也没经过检查，所以房子很不牢固。今年三月，房子的山墙向外裂开，该厂只用几根铁轨把墙顶住。市总工会劳保部、市劳动局等单位组织的工厂安全卫生检查小组，曾向该厂厂长徐干提出意见，说明房子有危险，应赶快修理。四月间，该厂呈经上级管理机关批准进行修理；但因为该厂领导干部根本忽视工人安全，所以在房子的所有权未确定（当地法院曾要这处房子，直到七月初皖北行署才把房子批归酒厂）的情况下，就把修房的事搁起来了。并且为了营业关系，又把这所原是做仓库的房子，改做生产场所（蒸酒）。八月中下了几天暴雨，八月二十九日早晨，六间房屋就一齐倒塌了。当时在屋里工作的有九个工人，一人当场死亡，三人死于医院，四人重伤，现仍在医院治疗中。这件事情当地有关机关已在严肃进行处理。该厂前后领导干部对待建筑工程态度是错误的，并严重地忽视工人安全，因而引起这一严重事件，这是应当引起各地注意的。
