Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 25th: The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council meeting, which began on the 21st in Berlin, concluded on the 24th. The meeting passed two resolutions regarding the new tasks for youth in the struggle for peace and the convening of an international conference to defend youth rights.

The meeting, based on the report by World Federation of Democratic Youth President Billinguer on the "Achievements of the Third World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and the New Tasks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Concerning Consolidating Youth's United Action in the Struggle for Peace," passed a resolution stating that the festival, with the participation of over 26,000 youth representatives from 104 countries and over two million German youth from various regions, has become a powerful demonstration of youth defending peace and opposing the threat of a new war. The youth representatives from various countries participating in the festival included youth from all strata and various political and religious beliefs. Youth representatives from twenty countries participated in the festival for the first time. The scale of the preparatory work for this festival and the number of participants greatly exceeded the previous two festivals. The resolution pointed out that the festival proved how powerful the international democratic youth movement opposing warmongers and fighting for the political and economic rights of youth has become. The call to intensify the collection of signatures for the Peace Pact declaration received a strong response at the festival.

The resolution calls on national youth organizations in various countries to widely publicize the achievements of the festival and to carry out this work under the slogan of further absorbing more youth to participate in the struggle for peace and against the threat of a new war, bringing the ideas of international peace, friendship, and solidarity to various countries, and inspiring youth around the world to fight more actively for peace. The resolution also calls on national youth organizations in various countries to more widely launch the Peace Pact declaration signature campaign, making this movement the center of their activities. The resolution points out that further consolidating the unity of youth in the peace movement is the primary task of all youth organizations, and national youth organizations in various countries should absorb broad masses of youth into various movements.

The meeting, based on the report by World Federation of Democratic Youth General Secretary Tenny on "Organizing an International Conference to Defend Youth Rights," passed a resolution stating that the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council agreed with the suggestion of youth organizations in many countries to hold an international conference to defend youth rights and tasked the World Federation of Democratic Youth Secretariat, in conjunction with other relevant organizations, to submit suggestions regarding the conference venue, agenda, and other issues to the next meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Executive Committee.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council calls on its member organizations to immediately begin preparing for this international conference and suggests holding national or local conferences to defend youth rights in various countries. The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council suggests that national youth organizations in colonial and dependent countries prepare for this conference under the slogan of mobilizing youth to more actively carry out the struggle for national independence and the struggle for the social and economic demands of youth. The resolution concludes by expressing its firm belief that the preparation work for and the holding of the International Conference to Defend Youth Rights will trigger a new upsurge in the struggle of youth to defend their needs and vital interests and strengthen the unity of youth in the struggle for peace and a better future.

Furthermore, the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council protested the extremely anti-democratic actions of the ruling groups in the United States, Britain, and Finland who attempted to persecute participants in the World Youth and Student Festival. The Council has instructed the Secretariat to lodge protests with the governments of the United States, Britain, and Finland.

    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林廿五日讯：二十一日起在柏林举行的世界民主青年联盟理事会会议，已于二十四日结束。会议就青年争取和平的新任务及召开保卫青年权利的国际会议通过了两项决议。
    会议根据世界青联主席比林格尔所作关于“第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的成就和世界民主青联关于巩固青年在争取和平的斗争中的一致行动的新任务”的报告通过决议说：一百零四个国家的青年代表二万六千多人和德国各地青年二百多万人参加了联欢节，它已成为青年保卫和平反对新战争威胁的强有力的示威。参加联欢节的各国青年代表包括各个阶层、各种政治和宗教信仰的青年。有二十个国家的青年代表头一次参加了联欢节。这次联欢节在筹备工作的规模上和参加的人数上，都大大超过了前两次联欢节。决议指出：联欢节证明反对战争贩子、争取青年政治和经济权利的国际民主青年运动已形成怎样强大的力量。关于加紧为和平公约宣言征集签名的号召，在联欢节上得到了有力的响应。
    决议号召各国的全国性青年团体广泛宣传联欢节的成就，并且在进一步吸收更多青年参加争取和平和反对新战争威胁的斗争的口号下，进行这项工作，把国际和平、友好和团结的思想带到各国，鼓舞全世界青年更积极地为争取和平而斗争。决议并号召各国的全国性青年团体更广泛地展开和平公约宣言签名运动，把这个运动作为它们活动的中心。决议指出：进一步巩固青年在和平运动中的团结是各青年团体的首要任务，各国的全国性青年团体应把广泛的青年群众吸收到各种不同的运动中来。
    会议根据世界青联总书记特尼所作关于“组织保卫青年权利的国际会议”的报告通过的决议说：世界民主青联理事会同意许多国家青年团体主张举行保卫青年权利的国际会议的建议，并责成世界民主青联书记处会同其他有关团体，就会议地址、议程等问题，向世界民主青联下一次执行委员会会议提出建议。
    世界民主青联理事会号召各会员团体立即开始筹备这一国际会议，并建议在各国举行全国性或地方性的保卫青年权利会议。世界民主青年联盟理事会建议：殖民地和附属国的全国性青年团体，在动员青年更积极地进行争取民族独立和争取青年的社会及经济要求的斗争的口号下筹备这次会议。决议最后表示深信国际保卫青年权利会议的筹备工作和会议的举行，会引起青年保卫自身需要和切身利益的斗争的新高潮，并加强青年在争取和平和美好将来的斗争中的团结。
    又讯：世界民主青年联盟理事会抗议美国、英国与芬兰的统治集团企图迫害世界青年与学生联欢节参加者的极端反民主的行为。理事会已责成书记处向美、英、芬三国政府提出抗议。
