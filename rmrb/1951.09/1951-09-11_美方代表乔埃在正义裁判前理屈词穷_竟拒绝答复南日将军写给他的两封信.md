Xinhua News Agency, 10th. U.S. Chief Representative to the Korean armistice talks, Joy, being at the end of his rope, has refused to answer two letters written to him on September 6th by our Chief Representative, General Nam Il. General Nam Il's two letters refuted Joy's September 4th letter, which denied the fact that U.S. aircraft constantly intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and dropped flares over the Kaesong neutral zone on August 29th, and that Syngman Rhee's troops continuously murdered our military police, and demanded that the U.S. side seriously and responsibly handle these incidents. When Ridgway Headquarters released the above-mentioned two letters from General Nam Il, it stated that the U.S. side would not respond. This, in effect, shows that the U.S. representative cannot but be silenced before impartial justice.

Since the U.S. side began to create a series of incidents undermining the neutralization of Kaesong, Joy's replies to General Nam Il's successive solemn protests have become more and more shameless in their sophistry. In his reply of August 22nd to General Nam Il's protest letter of August 19th, Joy tampered with the results of the on-site investigation by the liaison officers of both sides, attempting to deny the fact that the armed personnel who murdered our military police on August 19th were Rhee Syngman's troops under the command of the United Nations forces. In his reply of September 2nd to General Nam Il's protest letters of August 30th and 31st, Joy again used the excuse of so-called "thorough investigation" within the United Nations forces to groundlessly deny the facts of the US and Rhee forces' repeated sabotage of the neutralization of Kaesong with conclusive evidence, and even went so far as to lie to his face, denying the agreement reached by both sides on the neutralization of the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone. On September 4th, facing the irrefutable evidence in General Nam Il's protest letter of September 3rd, although Joy could no longer make any defense, he still repeated his nonsense regardless of the facts, saying that "United Nations forces troops have nothing to do with this incident" and that "no matter how much you say," it "completely cannot change" the so-called "facts" he fabricated.

    美方代表乔埃在正义裁判前理屈词穷
    竟拒绝答复南日将军写给他的两封信
    【新华社十日讯】参加朝鲜停战谈判的美方首席代表乔埃，由于理屈词穷竟拒绝答复我方首席代表南日将军九月六日写给他的两封信。南日将军的这两封信，驳斥了乔埃九月四日抵赖美机不断侵入开城中立区上空、并在八月二十九日在开城中立区上空投掷照明弹，以及李承晚部队连续谋杀我方军事警察的事实的来函，并要求美方认真负责地处理这些事件。李奇微总部在发表南日将军上述两封信时，声明美方将不作答复。这在事实上表明美国代表在正义的裁判前不能不哑口无言了。
    自从美方开始制造一连串破坏开城中立化事件以来，乔埃对于南日将军历次的严正抗议的答复，其所进行的狡辩，一次比一次无耻。乔埃八月二十二日答复南日将军八月十九日抗议书的复信中，窜改双方联络官实地调查的结果，企图抵赖八月十九日谋害我方军事警察的武装人员是联合国军统率下的李承晚军的事实。九月二日答复南日将军八月三十日及三十一日抗议书的复信，乔埃又藉口在联合国军内部进行了所谓“澈底调查”，毫无道理地一口否定证据确凿的美李军历次破坏开城中立化的事实，还不惜当面撒谎，否认双方达成的开城中立区上空中立化的协议。九月四日，乔埃面对南日将军九月三日抗议书中无可辩驳的根据，虽然无法再作任何辩解，但仍不顾事实地重复他的谰言说：“联合国军部队和这个事件毫不相干”，“无论说多少话”，都“完全不能改变”他所捏造的所谓“事实”。
