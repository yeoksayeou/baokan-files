Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: Representatives of one hundred and forty-six Japanese labor unions, peace committees, and democratic groups, numbering 1,500 people, held a meeting in Hiroshima on August 6th, the day it was bombed by the American atomic bomb. They entrusted the secretariat of the Hiroshima Peace Conference to submit a petition to our government, expressing their resolute opposition to the San Francisco Conference, which undermines world peace, and demanding the convening of a comprehensive peace conference. The full text of the petition is as follows:

To the esteemed government:
	We, the 1,500 representatives from 146 labor unions, peace committees, and democratic groups who came to Hiroshima on August 6th, the anniversary of the atomic bombing, after serious discussion, have entrusted our secretariat to submit the following petition to your government:
	1. We believe that the upcoming San Francisco Peace Conference is not a comprehensive peace conference based on international agreements and including all countries, but a conference for a one-sided peace and military treaty. This conference will lead to the enslavement and impoverishment of the Japanese people and will undermine world peace. We resolutely oppose it.
	2. Based on international agreements, we demand the immediate convening of a comprehensive peace conference, based on the agreement of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, including all countries, as the most important path to restoring democracy and safeguarding world peace.

	We ask your government to acknowledge the ardent desire of our people for peace and independence as expressed by the Hiroshima Conference and to satisfy our demands.

    日本百多个工会、和平委员会等团体代表
    自广岛向我国政府递交声请书
    坚决反对破坏世界和平的旧金山会议，要求召开全面和平会议。
    【新华社九日讯】日本一百四十六个工会、和平委员会和民主团体的代表一千五百人八月六日在曾遭受美国原子弹轰炸的广岛举行会议，并责成广岛和平会议书记处向我国政府递交声请书一件，表示坚决反对破坏世界和平的旧金山会议，要求召开全面和平会议。该书全文如下：
    于八月六日原子弹日前来广岛的日本的一百四十六个工会、和平委员会以及民主团体的一千五百个代表，经过严肃讨论之后，责成我会书记处，将下列声请书递交贵政府： 1、我们认为，行将召开的旧金山对日和平会议不是基于国际协定、包括各个国家在内的全面和会，而是片面和平与军事条约的会议。这种会议将导致日本人民的奴役与贫困，而且将破坏世界和平，我们坚决反对。
    2、根据国际协定，我们要求立即召开在美、苏、英、中协议的基础上、包括各个国家在内的全面和平会议，作为恢复民主以及保障世界和平最重要的道路。
    我们要求贵政府承认广岛会议所表现的我国人民要求和平与独立的热望并满足我们的要求。
            广岛和平会议书记处代表加久田秀雄
                         一九五一年八月六日
