To Your Excellencies, Heads of the Five Great Powers:

We, the representatives of hundreds of millions of peace-loving Japanese people from all regions of Japan, held the National Peace Conference on August 15, 1951. This is an unforgettable day. Six years ago on this day, Japanese militarism surrendered to the free nations.

We had sincerely hoped that a new page in Japanese history would be opened on this day, and that genuine world peace, freedom, democracy, and security of life would be realized in our lives. Now we are under the urgent threat of a third world war. Therefore, according to the resolution of the National Peace Conference representing hundreds of millions of Japanese people, we implore you, the heads of the great powers upon whom the maintenance of world peace and stability depends, to support the following proposals:

(1) The World Peace Council, convened in Berlin in February of this year, made the following appeal to the world: "In order to meet the hopes of millions upon millions of people around the world, regardless of their views on the causes of the danger of world war, ..., we ask the five great powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, and France—to conclude a peace pact."

Over five million two hundred thousand Japanese people (Note: As of September 15, the number of signatures in Japan has increased to five million five hundred thousand.) have already signed in support of this call for peace to be established through negotiation rather than the use of force. We hope your government will fulfill this sincere hope of ours.

(2) We oppose the rearmament of Japan and the provision of military bases. We are deeply concerned about the danger of Japan falling into fascism again and the fact that tens of thousands of war criminals have been released. We hope that we can conclude peace treaties with all countries as soon as possible, so as to establish friendly relations with them all and develop free trade and peaceful industries. We look forward to the immediate end of the state of war and the withdrawal of foreign troops. To this end, we sincerely hope to conclude a just peace treaty with all the countries that participated in the Pacific War. The majority of Japan's celebrities, scholars, and women expect a comprehensive peace treaty. Various national trade union conferences recently held in Japan have unanimously demanded and resolved to safeguard world peace and Japan's independence with a comprehensive peace treaty. We hope that after your government recognizes this true intention of us, the Japanese people, it will initiate the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, prevent the rearmament of Japan, and avoid participating in the San Francisco signing conference convened on September 4 and the conclusion of the US-Japan Security Treaty for the purpose of concluding a one-sided peace treaty.

We, representing hundreds of millions of Japanese people who desire a comprehensive peace treaty, earnestly hope that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four great powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and Great Britain—will be convened.

(3) We hope that all countries will reduce armaments to maintain world peace and support the following disarmament proposals of the Second World Peace Conference:

甲 Unconditionally prohibit all kinds of atomic weapons, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons and other tools for mass destruction of mankind.

乙 Declare the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal.

丙 Between 1951 and 1952, reduce all armies—land, air, and naval forces—by one-third to one-half simultaneously, proportionally, and progressively.

丁 Establish an international body under the Security Council, equipped with competent inspectors, responsible for supervising disarmament and prohibiting atomic, bacteriological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction.

We implore your government to approve the above proposals and initiate disarmament.

(4) We are grateful for the cooperative spirit and peaceful policies that your government has shown in promoting ceasefire negotiations in Korea—our neighbor. We hope that your government will make even greater efforts to achieve the success of the negotiations.

We expect that your government will make more valuable contributions to preventing the danger of war and establishing world peace for the well-being and security of mankind in the world.

    致五大国元首的呼吁书（日本全国和平会议的决议）阁下：
    我们，来自日本各地区的亿万爱好和平的日本人民底代表，已于一九五一年八月十五日举行全国和平会议。这是一个不可遗忘的日子。六年前的这一天，日本黩武主义向自由国家投降了。
    我们曾衷心地希望，日本历史新的一页会在这一天揭开，真正的世界和平、自由、民主和生活的安全会在我们的生活中实现。现在我们却受到第三次世界大战的紧急的威胁。因此，根据代表亿万日本人民的全国和平会议底决议，我们恳求你，世界和平与安定赖以维持的大国底元首，支持下列各项建议：
    （1）今年二月间在柏林召开的世界和平理事会曾向全世界作如下呼吁：“为了符合全世界千千万万人们的希望，不论他们对于造成世界战争危险的原因抱什么见解，……，我们要求五大国——美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国和法国——缔结和平公约”。
    超过五百二十万的日本人民（按：至九月十五日止，日本签名人数已增至五百五十万。）已经签名拥护此项主张以谈判方式而并非使用武力来建立和平的呼吁。我们希望贵政府满足我们此衷心的希望。
    （2）我们反对重新武装日本和提供军事基地，我们深切地关心日本再度陷入法西斯化的危险以及数以万计的战犯被释放的事实。我们希望，我们能够尽可能早日和各国缔结和约，以便和他们全体建立友好关系以及发展自由贸易与和平工业，我们盼望立即结束战争状态和撤退外国军队。为此目的，我们衷心地希望与曾经参加太平洋战争的各个国家缔结公正的和约。日本大多数的名流、学者，以及妇女期望全面和约。日本新近举行的各种全国性的工会会议，均一致要求并决议用全面和约来保障世界和平以及日本的独立。我们希望贵政府承认我们日本人民此种真实的意图之后，将倡议缔结全面对日和约，制止日本的再武装并避免参加为了缔结片面和约而于九月四日召开的旧金山签字会议和缔结美日安全条约。
    我们代表亿万愿望全面和约的日本人民，恳切地希望召开美国、苏联、中华人民共和国以及大不列颠四大国的外长会议。
    （3）我们盼望各国裁减军备以维持世界和平并支持第二届世界和平会议下述的裁军建议：
    甲无条件地禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器以及其它大规模毁灭人类的工具。
    乙宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    丙在一九五一年到一九五二年间，在同时、按比例、累进地裁减一切军队——陆军、空军和海军——三分之一到二分之一。
    丁在安全理事会之下建立一国际机构，配备以胜任的检察人员，负责监督裁减军备，禁止原子、细菌、化学以及其它大规模毁灭性的武器。
    我们恳求贵政府赞成上述建议并倡议裁军。
    （4）我们感激贵政府为了开展朝鲜——我们的邻邦——停战谈判所表现的富于合作精神的努力与和平政策。我们盼望贵政府将愈加努力，谋致谈判的成功。
    我们期望贵政府，为了世界人类的幸福与安全，将对于防止战争危险和建立世界和平作出更宝贵的贡献。
