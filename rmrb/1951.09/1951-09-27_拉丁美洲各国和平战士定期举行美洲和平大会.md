Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 20th: Latin American peace fighters are scheduled to convene the American Peace Congress in the capital of a Latin American country from October 24th to 28th this year. The Chilean newspaper "Democracia" recently published a declaration by the Standing Secretariat for the Defense of Peace, composed of representatives from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay, calling on all peace-loving people to actively participate in the congress.

The declaration states: The threat of a third world war makes it obligatory for the people of Latin American countries, as well as the people of all countries in the world, to defend peace. The agreements signed by Latin American countries and the United States at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Washington have caused great sacrifices for Latin American countries: the heavy burden of the arms race falls on the shoulders of the people of all countries, the natural resources of all countries are used to produce weapons of mass slaughter, the rights and freedoms of the people are further restricted, barracks are being built instead of schools and hospitals, and young people are receiving rifles and machine guns instead of bread and knowledge. However, if the people of all countries unite their strength to fight for the defense of peace, this situation can be changed.

The declaration emphasizes that the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers is of great significance to the people of all countries in the world, especially to the people of Latin American countries.

The declaration states: Latin American peace fighters will soon convene the American Peace Congress in order to express the desire of the people of the Americas for peace, and to formulate policies so that the people of all countries can contribute to preventing war and ensuring peace today, thereby saving the independence of Latin American countries and preserving their cultural heritage.

The declaration invites all who sincerely love peace, regardless of their political views, religious beliefs, or views on the causes of the current tensions, to participate in the congress.

    拉丁美洲各国和平战士定期举行美洲和平大会
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社蒙得维的亚二十日讯：拉丁美洲各国和平战士定于今年十月二十四日至二十八日在某一拉丁美洲国家首都举行的美洲和平大会即将召开，智利“民主报”顷发表了由阿根廷、智利、巴西、乌拉圭、巴拉圭五国代表组成的保卫和平常设书记处的宣言，号召一切热爱和平的人们都积极参加大会。
    宣言说：第三次世界大战的威胁，使拉丁美洲各国人民以及全世界各国人民都有义务保卫和平。拉丁美洲各国和美国在华盛顿举行的外长会议上所签订的协定，使拉丁美洲各国遭受了巨大牺牲：扩张军备运动的重负落到各国人民的肩上，各国天然资源被用来生产大规模屠杀武器，人民的权利与自由受到更多的限制，正在建筑的是兵营而不是学校与医院，青年们得到的不是面包和知识而是来复枪与机关枪。但是，如果各国人民把他们的力量团结起来进行保卫和平的斗争，就能改变这种情况。
    宣言着重指出：五大国缔结和平公约对全世界各国人民来说，特别是对拉丁美洲各国人民来说，是具有巨大的意义的。
    宣言声称：拉丁美洲和平战士即将召开美洲和平大会，以便表达美洲各国人民要求和平的意愿，并拟定方针使各国人民今日对制止战争确保和平有所贡献，从而挽救拉丁美洲各国的独立，并保全其文化遗产。
    宣言邀请一切真诚热爱和平的人们，不论他们的政治见解、宗教信仰或对造成目前紧张局势的原因的看法如何，都来参加大会。
