Brief Review of Cultural Life

The Achievements of the Chinese Michurin Society's Annual Meeting This Year

The 1951 annual meeting of the Chinese Michurin Society was held in Xinxiang City, Pingyuan Province, from August 20th to 25th. According to the work reports of the Society's Council and local branches over the past year, Michurin scientific workers in various regions have achieved certain results in proving Michurin's theories through experimental research, summarizing farmers' farming experiences, and applying the principles of Michurin's theory to variety improvement. Among the eighteen research papers read and discussed at this conference, four were written by model worker members Bi Xiqing, Shi Yudain, Zhou Shaoqing, and Wang Yuhua. This is a glory for China's Michurin agricultural work!

This year's annual meeting played a very powerful role in promoting the popularization and in-depth study of Michurin's theory in our country. Based on the experience discussed at this year's annual meeting, the experimental research work of Michurin science should not remain at the level of verifying theories but should go deep into the countryside, respond to the government's call for increased production, and take the main problems in agricultural production in various regions as the objects of experimental research. Therefore, the experimental research work of the Society must start with investigation and research, collect rich materials, and fully absorb the experience of advanced Michurin agricultural workers, and accept the agricultural scientific heritage accumulated by the motherland for thousands of years.

This meeting was very successful. From this meeting, we can see that the scientific workers of New China are treating advanced science and the valuable experience created by the masses with an extremely serious attitude, and are struggling to increase the wealth of the motherland.

    中国米邱林学会本届年会的成就
    中国米邱林学会一九五一年年会，于八月二十日至二十五日，在平原省新乡市举行。根据学会理事会及各地分会一年来的工作报告，各地米邱林科学工作者在证明米邱林学理的试验研究工作，总结农民耕作经验的工作，以及将米邱林学说原理应用于品种改良等方面，都获得了一定的成绩。在此次大会上所宣读和讨论的十八篇研究论文中，有劳动模范会员毕西庆、石玉殿、周绍清、王玉花等所作的论文四篇。这是中国米邱林农业工作的光荣！
    本届年会，对于米邱林学说在我国的普及与深入起了极有力的推动作用。根据本届年会所讨论的经验，对于米邱林科学的试验研究工作，不应该停留在学理的印证上，而应该深入农村，响应政府的增产号召，以各地区农业生产中的主要问题，作试验研究对象。因此，学会的试验研究工作，必须从调查考察着手，收集丰富的材料，并充分吸取先进米邱林农业工作者的经验，接受祖国几千年所积累的农业科学遗产。
    这次会议是开得非常成功的。从此次会议我们可以看出，新中国的科学工作者正以极其严正的态度来对待先进的科学以及群众所创造的宝贵经验，为增加祖国的财富而斗争。
