Adopting a policy of combining overcoming the current famine with long-term construction
    The Hebei Provincial People's Government leads the people in mountainous areas to improve their lives

The mountainous areas of Hebei Province include 43 counties in seven special districts: Tangshan, Tongxian, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Dingxian, Xingtai, and Handan, with a population of approximately 6.5 million, most of whom are from the old revolutionary base areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan. These areas generally have very little arable land (most of which is cultivated through terracing and滩地), with an average of only two mu of land per person; and the soil is barren and the yield is very low. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, these areas suffered severe destruction by the enemy. In addition, the lack of planned control over wasteland reclamation and firewood cutting in the past has led to the destruction of many mountain forests, which has loosened the ground, made it difficult to retain water and soil, so the terraces are often washed away by heavy rain, and the滩地 at the foot of the mountains are pressed by the increasing flow of sand year by year. The area of arable land is relatively reduced. Along with the destruction of mountain forests, there are also constant natural disasters such as water, drought, and wind. For example, in last year's flood, more than 540,000 mu of terraces and滩地 were washed away. Therefore, the people's lives are extremely difficult.

After the rent reduction and interest reduction during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the land reform and the large-scale production movement over the years, coupled with the direct assistance to the people from the organs and troops stationed in these areas, the production in the mountainous areas has been initially restored, and the people's lives have been initially improved. However, after 1948, the party and government leading organs at all levels moved from the countryside to the cities, and the direct assistance to the people in mountainous areas was weakened. The masses once complained to the People's Government, saying: "Once you go down the mountain, you forget the mountain." According to the above situation, the Hebei provincial leading organs began to pay attention to the production and life of the people in mountainous areas from the second half of 1950. In July, the Hebei Provincial People's Government convened a mountain area production conference, and determined the policy of combining the immediate solution of the current famine problem with long-term construction, and actively led the people in mountainous areas to carry out production. After autumn, two-fifths of the province's relief grain was distributed to the mountainous areas, and the most difficult counties were given consideration in terms of financial burden. The production and disaster relief work in the mountainous areas has made preliminary achievements.

In January, February, and April of this year, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, personally went to the mountainous areas of Fuping, Quyang, Miyun, Qianxi, Zunhua, Jixian, Shexian, and Wu'an three times to inspect the people's production and living conditions, and to express sympathy to the people in mountainous areas. In May, the Hebei Provincial People's Government sent an inspection team to Fuping, Quyang, Jianping, Yixian, Laiyuan, Miyun, Qianxi and other seven counties for inspection. In mid-July, the second provincial mountain area production conference was convened to summarize the mountain area production work in the first half of this year. This year, the following achievements have been made in organizing the people in mountainous areas to restore and develop agricultural and sideline production:

    1. The area of arable land has been restored and expanded, and water conservancy has been built. In the first half of this year, the Provincial People's Government invested a huge amount of loans and widely organized the masses to carry out labor mutual assistance. In half a year, 30 counties repaired 480,000 terraces and more than 90灘地, restoring and expanding the arable land by more than 360,000 mu. Twenty counties dredged 232 new and old canals, and ten counties built and repaired 1,944 new and old wells, expanding the paddy fields by approximately 34,100 mu.

    2. The planting of cash crops and high-yield crops has been newly developed. The planting area of ​​cotton, peanuts, and tobacco leaves has increased compared with previous years. For sweet potatoes alone, about 2 million mu are planted in the entire mountainous area, which can produce 2 billion jin. Calculated according to edible value, it is equal to 400 million jin of millet. The business of mulberry planting and silkworm breeding has also begun to recover. For tussah silkworms alone, 500,000 grains of cocoons can be produced in spring and autumn.

    3. Agricultural production technology has begun to be promoted to the mountainous areas. Wild grass grows luxuriantly in the mountainous areas, and insect pests are particularly serious. In order to reduce and eliminate insect pests, the province advocates "scientific and technological skills up the mountain." Various forms such as technical groups, training classes, and labor model symposiums were used in various places to widely impart insect control technology. The People's Government has lent out more than 1,600 sprayers and organized the masses to use medicine and machinery to kill insects. Remarkable achievements have been made in insect pest control. According to reports from Jixian, Zunhua, Quyang, Tangxian, Miyun and other five counties, this spring, 14.73 million fruit trees were scraped to prevent insect pests. The tent caterpillars that specifically harm apple, pear, and cherry trees in the eastern mountainous area did not occur this year. The jujube weevils that harm jujube trees and the armyworms that harm millet and sorghum in the western mountainous area have also been mostly eliminated. Jujube trees that had not yielded for three consecutive years have had a bumper harvest this year. After agricultural technology was promoted to the mountainous areas, it was universally welcomed by the masses.

    4. Closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation and planting fruit trees. This is a fundamental way to solve the poverty of people in mountainous areas and provide timber needed for national long-term construction. The province has adopted the policy of "relying on the masses to protect and cultivate forests," resolutely prohibits indiscriminate wasteland reclamation, indiscriminate slope clearing, and burning of mountains, and stipulates that newly reclaimed wasteland with a slope of less than 30 degrees must be terraced. In the past six months, 22 counties have closed 400,000 mu of mountains, and 11 counties have planted more than 73,000 mu of trees, approximately 4.6 million trees. Twelve counties have sown 18,000 mu of barren mountains, and ten counties have cultivated more than 320 mu of seedlings. Now the flow of some mountain gravel has stopped. The production of滩地 at the foot of the mountains is guaranteed. The masses have realized the benefits of closing mountains for afforestation. In the past, they reclaimed barren mountains indiscriminately, but now they have turned to automatic closing of mountains. In order to strengthen this work, 197 villages in 21 counties in the province's mountainous areas have organized forest protection committees, 141 villages have formulated forest protection covenants, and delineated mountain rights and mountain boundaries.

    5. Developed animal husbandry and strengthened the prevention and control of animal epidemics. In the past six months, 23 counties in the mountainous area have purchased and bred 21,321 heads of livestock and more than 144,000 sheep. It is estimated that the produced wool and fur can be worth 2.2 billion yuan, and a lot of fertilizer has been added, which is beneficial to agricultural production. At the same time, animal epidemic prevention stations have been established in the mountainous areas. For example, in order to prevent and treat anthrax and rinderpest in cattle, 13 counties including Yixian and Laiyuan have vaccinated 126,405 cattle. A large number of sheep and chickens have also been vaccinated.

    6. Various sideline productions have also developed, increasing the income of the masses. This played a great role in overcoming the spring famine this year. According to statistics from 23 counties, in the transportation sideline industry, about 10,000 heads of livestock carried coal and mountain goods in the first half of the year. The mutual aid group of Li Wanquan in Jianping County used four donkeys to carry coal, and each donkey earned eight jin of corn per day; the income in half a year accounted for one-half of the annual income. Quyang County organized women to make shoe soles. The county made more than 50,000 pairs of shoe soles every month, earning a total of 112,500 jin of rice.

At present, the lives of the people in most of the small villages in the deep mountains of Hebei have not completely gotten rid of the predicament, but they have improved a lot. For example, Pingdingshan Village, a severely affected village in Yixian County, sold 29 cattle last year; this year, with the support of loans and relief grain, the people's production enthusiasm is full, men contract to repair roads, women weed and collect wild vegetables, overcome the spring famine, and all the land is sown; they also bought 24 cattle, 71 sheep, and added 20 new farm tools. The masses in Zhaoshuigou Village planted apple trees all over the mountain gully and changed the name of the village to "Apple Gully." In a few years, they will be able to receive the fruits of their labor. The farmers in the mountainous area of ​​Quyang described the future prospects of their production recovery, saying: "White sheep bleating all over the mountain, waterwheels churning in the fields, donkeys braying everywhere." The people's production enthusiasm in the mountainous areas has risen, and they warmly support the People's Government. They no longer hear the complaints of "Once you go down the mountain, you forget the mountain." They are determined to do a good job in production to respond to the leadership and support of the People's Government. (Hu Yunhe, Zhang Xiangyang)

    采取克服当前灾荒与长期建设相结合的方针
    河北省人民政府领导山区群众改善了生活
    河北省的山区有唐山、通县、保定、石家庄、定县、邢台、邯郸等七个专区中的四十三县，约有六百五十余万人口，绝大部分是抗日战争时期的老根据地。这些地区一般是耕地很少（大部分靠修梯田和滩地来进行耕种），每人平均仅有二亩土地；且地质硗瘠，产量很低。在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争中，这些地区遭受敌人的严重摧残与破坏。加上过去缺乏有计划地制止开荒与砍柴，致不少山林被破坏，这就使地面松散，水土不易保持，因此梯田常被大雨冲涮，山下的滩地被逐年增加的流砂积压，耕地面积就相对减少，跟着山林被破坏而来的，还有历年不断的水、旱、风等自然灾害。如去年的水灾中，梯田、滩地就被冲毁了五十四万多亩。因此群众生活极其困苦。
    经过抗日战争期间的减租减息，及以后的土地改革和历年的大生产运动，加上驻在这些地区的机关、部队对群众的直接帮助，山区生产得到初步恢复，人民生活初步改善。但一九四八年以后，各级党、政领导机关由乡村转入城市，对山区群众生产的直接帮助就减弱了。群众曾埋怨人民政府说：“下了山，忘了山。”河北省领导机关根据以上情况，从一九五零年下半年起开始重视山区群众的生产和生活问题。七月间，河北省人民政府召开了山区生产会议，确定了立即解决当前灾荒问题与长期建设相结合的方针，积极领导山区群众进行生产。秋后，将占全省救济粮五分之二的粮食发给山区，对最困难的县份，并在财政负担上予以照顾。山区的生产救灾工作，作出了初步成绩。
    在今年一、二、四月间，河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席曾三次亲赴阜平、曲阳、密云、迁西、遵化、蓟县、涉县、武安等山区视察人民的生产与生活情况，慰问山区群众。五月间河北省人民政府又派出检查组到阜平、曲阳、建屏、易县、涞源、密云、迁西等七县进行检查。七月中旬召开了全省山区第二届生产会议，总结了今年上半年山区生产工作。本年来在组织山区群众恢复与发展农、副业生产方面，有了下面这些收获：
        一、恢复与扩大了耕地面积，兴修了水利。今年上半年，省人民政府投放了巨额的贷款，广泛组织群众进行劳力互助。半年中，三十个县修整梯田四十八万道，滩地九十余处，共恢复和扩大了耕地三十六万余亩。二十个县修浚新、旧渠二百三十二道，十个县打修新、旧井一千九百四十四眼，约共扩大水田三万四千一百亩。
        二、经济作物与多产作物的种植已有新的发展。棉花、花生、烟叶的种植面积已较往年增加。仅甘薯一项，全山区约栽二百余万亩，可产二十亿斤。按食用价值计算，等于小米四亿斤。种桑养蚕事业也已开始恢复。仅柞蚕一项，春秋两季可出茧五十万粒。
    三、农业生产技术开始向山区推广。山区野草丛生，虫害特别严重。为了减少和消灭虫害，该省提倡“科学技术上山”。各地通过技术组、训练班、劳动模范座谈会等各种形式，广泛地传授了除虫技术。人民政府并贷出喷雾器一千六百余架，组织群众使用药械杀虫。在防治虫害上已作出显著成绩。据蓟县、遵化、曲阳、唐县、密云等五县报告，今春刮皮以防止虫害的果树达一千四百七十三万余株。东部山区专门伤害苹果、梨、樱桃等果树的天幕毛虫今年没有发生。西部山区伤害枣树的枣步曲、伤害谷子与高粱的黏虫也大部消灭。一连三年不收的枣树，今年已获丰收。农业技术向山区推广以后，获得了群众的普遍欢迎。
    四、封山育林、栽植果树。这是解决山区人民生活贫困问题和供给国家长期建设所需木材的根本办法。该省采取了“依靠群众，护林育林”的方针，坚决禁止乱开荒、乱开坡和烧山，并规定坡度在三十度以下的新开荒地，一律垒好梯田。半年来，二十二个县封山四十万亩，十一个县植树七万三千余亩，约四百六十万余株。十二个县荒山播种一万八千亩，十个县育苗三百二十余亩。现在有的山砂石已停止下流。山下滩地的生产有了保证。群众已体会到封山育林的好处，过去是乱开荒山，现在已转变为自动封山。为了加强这一工作，全省山区已有二十一县的一百九十七个村组织了护林委员会，一百四十一村订立了护林公约，并划定了山权山界。
    五、发展了畜牧业，加强了防治兽疫工作。半年来山区有二十三个县，购入和繁殖了牲畜二万一千三百二十一头，羊十四万四千余只。估计所产毛、皮可值二十二亿元，且增加了很多肥料，有利于农业生产。同时在山区已建立起家畜防疫站。如易县、涞源等十三县，为了预防和治疗牛的炭疽病及牛瘟，共为十二万六千四百零五头耕牛打了防疫针。大量的羊和鸡也打了防疫针。
    六、各种副业生产也有了发展，增加了群众收入。这对今年度过春荒起了很大作用。据二十三个县的统计，在运输副业上，上半年约有一万头牲畜驮运煤炭、山货等。建屏县李万全的互助组用四头驴驮炭，每头驴每天赚八斤玉米；半年中的收入，占全年收入二分之一。曲阳县组织妇女纳鞋底生产，全县每月纳鞋底五万多双，共赚米十一万二千五百斤。
    现在，河北山区大部分深山小村的群众生活，虽未完全摆脱困苦状况，但已有了不少改善。如易县的重灾村平顶山村，去年卖牛二十九头；今年因得到贷款与赈粮的扶持，群众生产情绪饱满，男人包修公路，女人锄草、打野菜，战胜了春荒，土地全部播了种；还买了二十四头牛，七十一只羊，新添农具二十件。赵水沟村群众把山沟栽遍了苹果树，并将村名改为“苹果沟”。再过几年，他们就能收到劳动果实。曲阳山区的农民描述他们将来生产恢复的远景说：“满山白羊吗吗，田间水车呱呱，到处驴声呃哇。”山区人民的生产情绪已高涨起来，他们热诚拥护人民政府，再听不到“下了山、忘了山”的怨言。他们并决心要把生产搞好，以回答人民政府的领导与扶持。（胡运和，张向阳）
