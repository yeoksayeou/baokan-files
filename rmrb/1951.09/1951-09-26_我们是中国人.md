    We are Chinese
    By Our Correspondent Li Wen Chaoqi
    The story of the steel hero Liu Hui is spreading everywhere in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Some say that Liu Hui fought a brilliant battle and was visited by the Volunteer Army leaders when he was in the hospital; others say that Chairman Mao was very happy when he heard about it and immediately sent someone to Beijing to talk to him!
    Liu Hui is an ordinary young man of New China, but his temper is not very good. When he greeted the combat mission, he firmly realized his great responsibility to the motherland. When he saw his comrades, as members of the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League, making guarantees to the Party to complete the task, he was so excited that he could not remain silent. He said, "Although I am not yet a Party member, I am a 'Chinese'. I want to use the glorious title of 'Chinese' to guarantee to the Party and Chairman Mao: I will never tarnish the model honor of our class!"
    In the battle, he fulfilled his oath, completed the task assigned to him by his superiors, and established heroic achievements.
    The eighth squad to which Liu Hui belonged was stationed on Longyan Mountain in the northeast of Uijeongbu, blocking the enemy from advancing north. Longyan Mountain is no more than 300 meters high, and two long mountain legs extend straight to the highway in the south. The eighth squad's position was on one of the mountain legs. Liu Hui's machine gun group was just in the middle of the two rifle groups. They were far apart from each other, and could not see each other when the battle was fierce.
    That day's battle began and proceeded as usual. When the sun climbed over the mountain, the enemy's clumsy reconnaissance planes had already flown low and circled for reconnaissance several times. This was followed by artillery bombardment, aircraft bombing, and more artillery bombardment. In the afternoon, the US aggressor army's two battalions, with the cooperation of more than thirty tanks, began to attack in turn. At first, they launched attacks on the two mountain legs in four routes, and suffered heavy defeats. Later, they concentrated their forces to attack the position of the eighth squad.
    The battle was intense. Liu Hui did not know at the time how the two rifle groups defeated the enemy's three charges, killing and wounding more than 120 American soldiers; nor did he know how the squad leader—a Communist Party member who helped him the most and whom he respected the most—killed and wounded a large number of enemies and then sacrificed heroically. He peered out of the observation hole of the machine gun bunker and saw more than fifty enemy corpses lying in a mess on the hillside fifty or sixty meters away. This was the result of their machine gun's day of combat, and a pleasant smile emerged from his heart. But when the enemy finally rushed up and surrounded his bunker, his face became very serious. Although there was still a box of grenades in the bunker, the machine gun was buried in the mud during the enemy's tank shelling; the youngest Cai Ying was seriously injured, his face pale, and his life was in danger; the ammunition handler Jia Jianzhou's right arm was injured and he could not throw grenades; and his own left arm was also bleeding. He felt that the situation was very serious, but he was very calm.
    "I will not only deal with them, but also defeat them!" When he quickly took out a grenade from the wooden box, he said in a firm tone, as if encouraging his comrades and giving himself a combat mission.
    Hundreds of enemies were running around in a panic not far away, daring not to approach the bunker. The Kuomintang bandits mixed in with the American army howled hoarsely in Chinese: "Chinese, hand over your guns quickly!"
    "Hand over our guns?" Liu Hui spat contemptuously. "We are Chinese. Chinese people never yield! You shameless traitor, I am here today on behalf of the motherland to execute you!" He was so enraged that his blood almost burst out, and he deftly threw a grenade. After a loud bang, there was silence, and no more howls were heard.
    The panicked enemy threw grenades wildly at the bunker. Many of them exploded outside the bunker; but some also happened to be thrown into the bunker, landing not far from Liu Hui. He calmly and vigilantly picked up those grenades that had not yet exploded and threw them back out. American-made grenades bloomed in the enemy ranks.
    Liu Hui's mind never relaxed, and he constantly calculated how to defeat the enemy's attack. He thought: the enemy might use several tanks to crush the bunker, then I will use grenades to destroy them; or the enemy will use tank guns to bomb the bunker, but the bunker cannot be destroyed, I will simply ignore it; or the enemy will use "human bullet" tactics, a group of people will swarm in, then I will blow them up outside the bunker door; or... anyway, I will not give the enemy any advantage. But he did not expect that these inhumane beasts would be so vicious, and the enemy actually used poison gas and gasoline to burn them. But people can defeat beasts. No cruel means can make our steel warriors submit. When the first poison gas bomb exploded outside the bunker, he smelled an unusual gunpowder smell, and he sharply shouted: "Poison gas! Poison gas!" He immediately wet the soil with urine, then wrapped it with clothes and tightly covered his nostrils. At the same time, he still did not let go of any opportunity to throw grenades to repel the enemy's attack. The enemy then poured gasoline in from the communication trench. Liu Hui and his comrades immediately used their hands to splash the gasoline flowing in outward. But there was more and more gasoline, and there was no time to splash it by hand. They changed to using shovels to shovel soil and cover it up, and finally took off their cotton coats to put out the flames.
    This fierce battle took place within an hour. Now everything has returned to temporary silence. The golden sun shines on the earth, as if it is Liu Hui and his comrades who have been tempered in the crucible, radiating the glory of the Chinese people that can never be defeated in the enemy ranks.
    The sudden cessation of the tense battle almost gave Liu Hui a feeling of emptiness in a short period of time. Most of the enemies had retreated to a farther place, and only about two squads of enemies remained around the bunker. They carried all kinds of weapons, with two machine guns pointed at the bunker entrance.
    "Look, what tricks are they up to again?" Liu Hui asked Jia Jianzhou.
    "Monitoring us."
    "Simply dreaming! Two battalions of troops have been defeated, how can two squads monitor us?" Liu Hui smiled contemptuously.
    When the night enveloped the battlefield after the fierce battle, they had prepared everything. They sadly buried their gloriously sacrificed comrade, Cai Ying, in the bunker, and delivered a brief eulogy: "Little Cai: It is glorious for you to sacrifice for the motherland, we will always remember you, we will avenge you!" They also took out the machine gun that was buried in the soil, and inserted all the remaining grenades around their waists. They prepared to break through while the enemy was not paying attention. Liu Hui held two grenades in his hand in front, and Jia Jianzhou carried the machine gun in the back. They crawled in the communication trench, lightly, not letting the enemy discover them. Not far from the two machine gun positions, Liu Hui threw out two grenades. The enemy was in chaos. The two of them leaped out of the communication trench like shadows. Bullets whistled wildly and blindly in the air. They walked, sometimes crawled, and victoriously returned to their company's position.

    我们是中国人
    本报记者  力文·超祺
    在中国人民志愿军某部里，到处流传着钢铁英雄刘辉的故事。有的人说，刘辉打了一个出色的仗，在住医院时，被志愿军首长接去慰问了；有的人则说，毛主席听到了很高兴，马上派人来接到北京去和他谈话啦！
    刘辉是一个普通的新中国青年，只是脾气不很好。他在迎接战斗任务的时候，坚定地认识到他对于祖国的伟大责任。当他看到战友们纷纷以共产党员或者青年团员的身份，向党提出保证完成任务的决心的时候，他激动得不能沉默了，他说：“我虽然还不是党员，但我是一个‘中国人’。我要以‘中国人’光荣的称号向党、向毛主席保证：决不玷污咱班的模范荣誉！”
    在战斗中，他执行了他的誓言，完成了上级交给他的任务，建立了英雄的功绩。
    刘辉所属的第八班据守着议政府东北的龙岩山，阻击北犯的敌人。龙岩山高不过三百公尺，有两条长长的山腿直伸达南面的公路。八班的阵地就在其中的一条山腿上。刘辉的机枪组刚好在两个步枪组的中间。他们彼此相隔很远，在战斗激烈的时候，互相都看不见。
    那一天的战斗是和以往一样开始和进行的。太阳爬上山岗的时候，敌人的笨重的侦察机已经低飞盘旋侦察了好几遍。接着是排炮轰击，飞机狂炸，又是排炮轰击。到了下午，美侵略军第三师两个营的兵力，在三十余辆坦克的配合下，开始轮番攻击。他们起初分四路进攻两条山腿，遭到了惨重的失败。以后就集中兵力攻击第八班的阵地。
    战斗激烈地进行。刘辉当时并不清楚两个步枪组是怎样击败敌人的三次冲锋，毙伤美军一百二十多名；也不知道班长——一个对他帮助最大，他最尊敬的一位共产党员，率领步枪组杀伤了大量敌人以后怎样牺牲的。他从机枪掩体的了望孔向外窥望，看见五十余具敌人的尸体乱七八糟地躺在五六十公尺外的山坡上。这是他们的机枪一天的战绩，他脸上浮起了一种从内心发出来的愉快的微笑。但是当敌人最后冲上来，把他的地堡包围的时候，他的脸孔变得十分严肃了。地堡里虽然还有一箱手榴弹，但是机枪在敌人的坦克炮轰击时被埋在泥土里了；年纪最小的蔡莹负了重伤，脸色苍白，有性命危险；弹药手贾健周的右臂挂了彩，不能扔手榴弹；而他自己的左臂也流着血。他感到情况是十分严重的，但是他很镇定。
    “我不仅要对付他们，而且要战胜他们！”当他迅速地从木箱里取出手榴弹的时候，以坚定的语气说道，仿佛是鼓励他的战友，也仿佛是给自己下战斗任务。
    数百个敌人慌乱地在不很远的地方转来转去，不敢靠近地堡。夹杂在美军中的国民党匪徒用中国话嘶哑地嚎叫着：“中国人，赶快交枪吧！”
    “交枪？”刘辉轻蔑地吐了一口唾沫。“我们是中国人。中国人从来是不屈服的！你这不知羞耻的叛徒，我今天代表祖国来枪毙你！”他激怒得血快迸出来，敏捷地扔出一个手榴弹。轰隆巨响之后，是一片沉寂，听不到嚎叫了。
    慌张的敌人向地堡乱投手榴弹。许多都在地堡外面爆炸了；但也有恰恰掷进地堡里来的，落在刘辉的身旁不远的地方，他沉着而机警地拾起那些还未爆炸的手榴弹转抛出去。美国制的手榴弹在敌人群中开了花。
    刘辉的思想一直没有松弛，他不断地盘算着：如何击败敌人的进攻。他想：敌人可能用几辆坦克来轧毁地堡，那么我就用手榴弹击毁它们；或者敌人用坦克炮来轰地堡，但是地堡是轰不毁的，我根本就不理睬它；又或者敌人会使用“肉蛋”战术，一群人蜂拥进来，那我就把他们炸死在地堡门外；或者……反正不给敌人占一点便宜。但是他没有想到这些灭绝人性的野兽会这样的毒辣，敌人竟用毒气和汽油来烧杀他们。但是人是能战胜野兽的。任何残酷的手段都不能使我们钢铁的战士屈服。当第一颗毒气弹在地堡外面爆炸时，他嗅到一股异乎寻常的火药味的气味，他敏锐地喊：“毒气！毒气！”马上用小便淋湿泥土，然后用衣服包住，紧紧掩住鼻孔。同时，他仍不放松任何机会扔手榴弹，击退敌人的进攻。敌人又用汽油从交通壕里灌进来。刘辉和他的战友立即用双手把流进来的汽油向外泼。但是汽油愈来愈多，用手泼来不及了。他们便改用铁锹铲泥土，把它掩盖起来，最后脱下棉衣扑灭火苗。
    这场激烈的战斗是在一个小时以内进行的。现在一切归于暂时的静寂了。金色的太阳照耀着大地，仿佛就是经过了千锤百炼的刘辉和他的战友，在敌人群中放射着永远不可被战胜的中国人民的光辉。
    由于紧张的战斗突然中止，几乎使得刘辉在短短的时间内有点空虚的感觉。大部分的敌人已经退到较远的地方去了，在地堡周围的只剩下约两班敌人。他们带着各种各样的武器，两挺机枪对着地堡门口。
    “你瞧，他们又搞什么名堂？”刘辉问贾健周。
    “监视我们。”
    “简直是做梦！两个营的兵力都被打败了，两班人又怎能监视我们？”刘辉轻蔑地一笑。
    当夜幕笼罩了激战后的战场的时候，他们已把一切准备停当。他们沉痛地在地堡里掩埋了光荣牺牲的战友——蔡莹，并致了简短的悼词：“小蔡：你为祖国牺牲是光荣的，我们永远记着你，我们要为你报仇！”他们又把被埋在土里的机枪取出来，把剩下的手榴弹统统插在腰间。准备趁着敌人不注意的时候突围。刘辉手里拿着两枚手榴弹在前面，贾健周背着机枪在后头。他们在交通壕里爬着，轻轻地，不让敌人发现。离那两挺机枪阵地不远了，刘辉把两颗手榴弹扔出去。敌人混乱了。他们两个像影子一样跃出交通壕。子弹疯狂地、盲目地在空中呼啸。他们走着，有时爬着，胜利地回到了自己连的阵地。
