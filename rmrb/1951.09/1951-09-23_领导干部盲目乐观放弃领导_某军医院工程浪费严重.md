    Leading Cadres' Blind Optimism Leads to Abandonment of Leadership; Serious Waste in a Certain Military Hospital Project
    To the Editor:
    The Xuzhou Branch of the Shandong Construction Engineering Company contracted for the construction of a certain military hospital's buildings in October of last year. The company did not conduct thorough research and planning for the project beforehand, and lacked inspection during construction. As a result, rework waste, work stoppages due to material shortages, and project delays occurred, resulting in a fine of 300,000 catties of millet. The main reason for the above errors was the blind optimism of the leading cadres. Since its establishment in November 1949, the branch had never undertaken such a large project as the military hospital. Now that it had accepted the project, the leadership indiscriminately treated certain technical personnel as guests and gave each person in the company a catty of pork. This unprincipled appeasement of technical personnel fostered incorrect views of arrogance and technological supremacy. Technical personnel then adopted a perfunctory attitude in their work and did not conduct on-site surveys. Construction personnel did not reside at the construction site to guide and supervise the work, so rework and waste continuously occurred during the construction process, causing serious losses worth more than 10,000 catties of millet. Preparations before the start of construction were also insufficient, resulting in work stoppages due to material shortages during construction. After accepting the project, the leading cadres of the company believed that everything was fine and did not conduct research and planning. As a result, the supply of materials was neither timely (yellow sand delayed by thirteen days, roofing panels delayed by ten days, crushed stone delayed by five days) nor up to specifications (the ground was supposed to use crushed brick, but because it could not be purchased, crushed stone was used instead; paulownia wood was replaced with fir wood), which led to poor project quality and significant delays. Furthermore, for such an important project, the leading cadres of the branch failed to adequately study the organization and leadership of the construction site and the allocation of cadres. They only sent three construction workers and one warehouse keeper before starting construction. The company did not clearly assign responsibilities to these four people, so no one was responsible during construction, resulting in rework and waste.

### 领导干部盲目乐观放弃领导  某军医院工程浪费严重

    领导干部盲目乐观放弃领导
    某军医院工程浪费严重编辑同志：
    山东建筑工程公司徐州分公司于去年十月间，承建了某军医院房屋工程。该公司事先对工程未进行很好的研究和布置，施工中又缺乏检查，因此发生了返工浪费、停工待料、工程逾期的现象；并被罚小米三十万斤。造成以上错误的主要原因是：领导干部盲目乐观。该分公司自一九四九年十一月成立后，从未承办过像某军医院这样大的工程。现在接受了此项工程，领导方面即无原则地请某些技术人员的客，并给公司中每人发了一斤猪肉。对技术人员采取无原则的迁就，结果滋长了技术人员的自高自大、技术至上的不正确观点。技术人员在工作中也就采取了应付差事的态度，不实地勘查。施工人员不驻在工地指导与监督施工，所以在施工过程中不断地发生返工浪费，造成价达一万余斤小米的严重损失。开工前准备工作作的也很不够，因而在施工中发生了停工待料的现象。该公司接受工程后，领导干部认为百事大吉，未进行研究布置，因而材料供应既不及时（黄砂误十三天，屋面板误十天，碎石误五天），又不合乎规格（规定地坪应用碎砖，因购不到，而改为碎石；桐木板改为杉木板），以致工程质量不好，且逾期甚久。又像这样重要的工程，该分公司领导干部未能很好研究工地的组织领导和干部的配备，只派去了三个施工员，一个保管员，就开工了；派去的这四个人，公司也没给明确分工，所以在施工中谁也负责，谁也不负责，造成返工浪费。  读者  联心
