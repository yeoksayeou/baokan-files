Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: What exactly is the purpose of the US representative's deliberate sabotage of the Kaesong talks? This has become a topic of conversation for everyone concerned about the situation in Korea. A Reuters reporter in Kaesong stated that the Americans are trying to shift the responsibility for undermining the Kaesong talks to Syngman Rhee. A dispatch from the agency's Kaesong bureau on the 1st stated: "Today, Allied observers here raised the following questions: 'What does the United Nations hope to gain by disrupting the truce talks using the incidents the Communists are talking about?' 'What do the Communists hope to gain by 'arranging' such incidents using pre-arranged bombings and 'fabricated' shootings, as well as the dropping of flares, etc.?'" Thus, the so-called Allied observers put forward "a third opinion," namely that "the alleged incidents may have been committed by a mysterious 'third party.'" He also explicitly stated that the so-called "third party" is "a group of fanatical leaders" in South Korea.

Here, although this so-called Allied observer deliberately conjures up a "third party" to exonerate Ridgway and Joy, he also tells a bit of the truth. This so-called Allied observer cannot but admit that the lie fabricated by Ridgway, Joy, and others that the Korean Air Force bombed its own representatives is too absurd, and even the so-called Allied observers (that is, the Americans themselves) believe that this is a completely unbelievable ghost story. But the mysterious "third party" mentioned by this so-called Allied observer simply does not exist. The fact is that the US planes bombed the Kaesong neutral zone, and the ground forces that attacked the Kaesong neutral zone were the troops of Syngman Rhee, who was commanded by the Americans. Syngman Rhee and his subordinates are certainly not a "third party," nor are they in any way "mysterious." Syngman Rhee's troops are completely under the command of the Americans, and his representatives also participated in Joy's delegation, so it is impossible and completely untrue to imagine that Syngman Rhee's actions are not under American control. The American generals are just singing a duet with him according to a pre-arranged plan.

So, "What does the United Nations hope to gain by disrupting the truce talks using the incidents the Communists are talking about?" It is not difficult to answer this question. One of the purposes of the "United Nations" - that is, the US side - in sabotaging the meeting by means of military provocations and murdering members of the Chinese and Korean People's negotiating delegation is to coerce the Korean and Chinese delegation in order to seize Korean territory. Since the Korean armistice talks entered the discussion of the actual agenda on July 26, the US side has proposed to push the military demarcation line for the armistice deep into the positions of the Chinese and Korean side, demanding that the Chinese and Korean side withdraw from 12,000 square kilometers of land, that is, the absurd demand that the United States obtain 12,000 square kilometers of Korean territory. But the Chinese and Korean side firmly rejected this bloody demand for aggression. All of these are well-known facts. The United States' intimidation and blackmail at the negotiating table failed. In this way, they took crazy provocative measures outside the venue, trying to use despicable and barbaric acts of attack and bombing to murder and force the Chinese and Korean sides to accept their unreasonable conditions. Another reason why the US side is undermining the truce talks is that they fear that if the armistice becomes a reality soon, the US government's proposed $66.5 billion defense budget and "foreign aid" bill will not be passed in the current US Congress, which is scheduled for mid-September; the US-British peace treaty with Japan will encounter greater opposition, to the point of being impossible to pass; the frenzy of arms expansion and war preparation in vassal states such as Britain and France will cool down; in this way, the astonishing war profits that Morgan, Rockefeller, DuPont, and Mellon, these billionaires, are now gaining from the Korean War and the expansion of armaments will be reduced. All of these are also well-known facts, and have been announced more than once by everyone from the giants of the US government to the American propaganda organs. Because of this, the US government will do everything possible to delay and sabotage the progress of the Korean armistice talks, to continue to maintain the tense atmosphere in Korea and the entire international situation, in order to force the US Congress to pass a budget for expanding armaments, to force the US vassal states to accept the US-made peace treaty with Japan with the rearmament of Japan as its central goal, and to force them to continue to expand armaments and prepare for war. As early as July 18, Marshall "predicted" that the Korean armistice talks would take more than six weeks; later, on July 30, he further "predicted" that the negotiations would "not have results" in the next six weeks. These public statements by Marshall clearly show that the US government believes that the Korean armistice talks need to continue to be delayed. It can be seen from this that the series of criminal acts by the United States and South Korean armed forces in attacking the Kaesong neutral zone, killing military police on the Chinese and Korean side, and the US Air Force aircraft intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone, bombing and strafing to murder members of the Chinese and Korean delegation, was a planned arrangement by the US government for the purpose of delaying negotiations and creating a tense situation.

### 美国故意破坏开城谈判制造紧张局势  图迫使其仆从国接受重新武装日本为目标的对日和约

    美国故意破坏开城谈判制造紧张局势
    图迫使其仆从国接受重新武装日本为目标的对日和约
    【新华社六日讯】美国代表故意破坏开城谈判的目的究竟是什么呢？这已经成为一切关心朝鲜形势的人们的话题。路透社在开城的一个记者表示美国人正在试图把破坏开城谈判的责任转嫁给李承晚。该社开城一日电称：“今日此间盟国观察家提出下列问题：‘联合国用共产党所说的事件来破坏停战会议，究竟为要获得什么呢？’‘共产党用预先布置的轰炸和‘伪造’的射击，以及空投照明弹等说法来‘安排’这样的事件，究竟为要获得什么呢？’”于是所谓盟国观察家提出了“一个第三种意见”，即“所传说的各项事件，可能是神秘的‘第三者’所为”。他又明白地表示，所谓“第三者”，就是南朝鲜的“一批疯狂的首领们”。
    在这里这个所谓盟国观察家虽然故意找出一个“第三者”来替李奇微、乔埃寻求开脱，却也说了一点真话。这个所谓盟国观察家不能不承认李奇微、乔埃等人所捏造的朝鲜空军自己轰炸自己的代表的谎言是太过荒唐了，就连所谓盟国观察家（也就是美国人自己）也认为这是根本不能使人相信的鬼话。但是这个所谓盟国观察家所说的神秘的“第三者”却是根本不存在的。事实是轰炸开城中立区的是美国飞机，而袭击开城中立区的地面部队则是美国人所指挥的李承晚的部队。李承晚及其部下当然不是什么“第三者”，也毫无什么“神秘”。李承晚的部队完全受美国人指挥，他的代表也参加了乔埃的代表团，所以设想李承晚的行动不在美国控制之下是不可能的，完全不合事实的。美国的将军们不过是按照预定计划和他唱双簧吧了。
    那么，“联合国用共产党所说的事件来破坏停战会议，究竟为要获得什么呢？”要答复这个问题是不难的。“联合国”——也就是美国方面用军事挑衅和谋杀中朝人民谈判代表团的办法来破坏会议的一个目的，是胁迫朝中代表团以便夺取朝鲜的领土。从七月二十六日朝鲜停战会议进入实际议程的讨论以后，美方就提出把停战军事分界线深入中朝方面阵地之内，要求朝中方面退出一万二千方公里土地，也就是美国取得朝鲜领土一万二千方公里的荒谬要求。但是朝中方面坚决地拒绝了这个血腥侵略的要求。所有这些，都是世所共知的事实。美国在谈判的会议桌上的恫吓和讹诈是失败了。这样他们就在会场以外采取了疯狂的挑衅手段，想用袭击和轰炸谋杀的卑鄙野蛮行为迫使朝中方面接受他们的无理条件。美方破坏停战会议的另一个原因，就是他们惧怕停战如果很快成为事实，美国政府所提出的六百六十五亿美元的国防预算及“援外”法案就会不能在预定于九月中旬的本届美国国会中通过；美英对日和约就会遇到更大的反对，以至有不能通过的危险；英法等仆从国家扩军备战的狂热就会跟着冷下来；这样，摩根、洛克菲勒、杜邦和梅隆这些亿万富豪现在利用朝鲜战争和扩军备战而取得的惊人战争利润就会减少下去。所有这些，也都是世所共知的事实，而且是为从美国政府的巨头起直到美国的宣传机关为止所不止一次地宣布过的。因为这样，美国政府就要使尽一切手段来拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的进行，来继续保持朝鲜和整个国际局势的紧张空气，以便迫使美国国会通过扩张军备的预算案，迫使美国的仆从国家接受重新武装日本为中心目标的美制对日和约，并迫使他们继续扩军备战。马歇尔还在七月十八日就“预料”朝鲜停战谈判需要六个星期以上的时间；后来在七月三十日，他又进一步“预料”谈判在今后六个星期内“还不能有结果”。马歇尔所公开发表的这些言论，清楚地说明了美国政府认为朝鲜停战谈判还需要继续拖延。由此可见，美国和南朝鲜武装部队袭击开城中立区，杀害朝中方面的军事警察及美国空军飞机侵入开城中立区，轰炸扫射谋杀朝中方面代表团的一系列犯罪行为，乃是美国政府为着拖延谈判制造紧张局势的目的而有计划地布置的。
