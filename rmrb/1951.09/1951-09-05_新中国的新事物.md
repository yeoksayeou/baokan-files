New Things in New China

The People Love the People's Liberation Army
Editor:
    I am a revolutionary soldier. In early August, I came to Beijing due to work. The people of the capital treated and cared for us with the warmth they would show their own children. This moved me deeply.
    While I was waiting for the train at Yongdingmen Station, the weather was very hot. An old worker, about sixty-seven years old, came over and kindly asked if we were hot and thirsty, and offered to boil water for us. He also said, "Although I am old, I want to work actively, increase production, and donate airplanes and cannons to support our Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army."
    Once, I went to a railway cafeteria to eat. Part of the cafeteria's dining area was set up outdoors. The waiter warmly invited me inside when he saw me going to eat. The workers eating inside enthusiastically offered me their seats, and they went outside to sit themselves. They said, "It's sandy outside when the wind blows, so it's better inside. You are fighting hard for our happiness and safety. Today, you have come here to eat, and we are honored to have the opportunity to serve you." The waiter noticed that I was sweating and thoughtfully brought me a fan and a towel to use.
    Editor, being loved and comforted by the people, I feel more deeply the honor of the People's Liberation Army. These honors were earned under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. I must work hard and strive to make more contributions to the people, to thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their cultivation and education, and to repay the people's love.

"Postal Service Car" at Beijing Station
    On the day when the people of the whole country warmly celebrated the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Postal and Telecommunications Bureaus under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications drove a brand-new "Postal Service Car" to the platform of the East Railway Station in the capital to serve the thousands upon thousands of passengers getting on and off the train, as a gift to the Party's birthday.
    Passengers who get on the train are sometimes anxious when they drop something or forget something, but now, there is no need to worry - when you walk into the station platform, you will see a cream-colored "Postal Service Car" placed opposite the train. On the glass wall of the car, it is written: "Do you want to send a letter, buy a newspaper, make a phone call, or send a telegram? Please come here!" Here you can buy the People's Daily and other newspapers published on the same day. You can also buy all kinds of magazines here; you can buy stamps and send letters. Especially convenient is - if passengers are about to leave Beijing and still have something to tell their relatives and friends, they can come to the service car to make a public phone call. If passengers want to report their itinerary to relatives and friends, or need relatives and friends to pick them up at the destination station, they can send a telegram in the service car. Because the service train gives passengers so much convenience, it has been praised by many passengers.
    In July, the postal service car sold a total of 1,492,200 yuan in stamps, sold 437 postal cards and postcards, collected and sent 423 pieces of mail, sold 470 copies of newspapers and periodicals, retailed 364 local telephone calls, and sent and received 16 telegrams. At present, this "Postal Service Car" is limited to serving only a few trains due to manpower constraints. The two postal and telecommunications bureaus are preparing to increase manpower to serve passengers on every train.

    人民热爱解放军编辑同志：
    我是一个革命军人。八月上旬，我因工作关系到北京来。首都的人民像爱护自己的子女一样，热情地招待、关心我们。这使我非常感动。
    当我在永定门车站等车时，天气非常热。一位六十七岁的老工人走来亲切地对我问热问渴，并给我们烧开水喝。他还说：“别看我年纪大，我要积极工作，增产捐献飞机大炮，支援咱们的志愿军和解放军。”
    有一次，我到一个铁路食堂吃饭。那个食堂的餐室一部分设在屋外。招待员同志见我去吃饭，就热情地让我到屋里去。在屋里吃饭的工人热情地让座给我，自己到外边去坐。他们说：“刮风时外边有砂，不如屋里好。你们为了我们的幸福和安全艰苦奋斗，今天你们到这里来吃饭，我们有机会招待你们，真是无上光荣。”招待员同志看到我头上流汗，就体贴地拿来扇子和毛巾，给我使用。
    编辑同志，受到人民的热爱和慰问，我更深切地感到人民解放军的荣誉。这些荣誉是在党和毛主席的英明领导下得来的。我一定要好好工作，争取为人民多立功，来感谢党和毛主席的培养教育，来报答人民的热爱。

    北京车站上的“邮电服务车”
    正当全国人民热烈庆祝中国共产党三十周年纪念的那天，邮电部所属北京邮电两局，把一辆崭新的“邮电服务车”开到首都东车站月台，为千千万万上下列车的旅客服务，作为对党生日的献礼。
    平日上车的旅客，有的漏掉东西，或忘掉什么事情，很着急，可是，现在可用不到着急了，——当你走进车站月台时，你会看到一部奶油色的“邮电服务车”摆在列车的对面，车面玻璃板壁上写着：“你要寄信、买书报、打电话、电报吗？请到这里来！”这里可以买到当天出版的人民日报和其他报纸，这里也可以买到各种杂志；这里可以买邮票，可以寄信。尤其方便的是——旅客要离开北京了，如果还有什么事情需要告诉亲友，就可以到服务车来打公用电话。旅客如果要向亲友报告行程，或需要亲友去目的地车站迎接，就可在服务车上拍发电报。正因为服务列车给了旅客这样多的方便，因此获得很多旅客的称赞。
    在七月内，邮电服务车总计售出邮票一，四九二，二○○元，售出邮简及明信片四三七枚，收寄邮件四二三件，售出报纸、期刊四七○份，零售市内电话三六四次，收发电报十六通。目前这部“邮电服务车”，因限于人手，只能为少数几次列车服务，邮电两局正准备增派人手做到为每次来往列车上的旅客服务。
