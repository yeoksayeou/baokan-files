Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" Criticizes Simonov's "Selected Poems" Published Last Year

    Following the solemn criticism made by "Pravda" on July 1st of harmful thoughts and errors in Soviet literature and art, "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article on July 10th entitled "The Living and the Dead in Simonov's Poems," criticizing Simonov's "Selected Poems" published in 1951. According to the author, this "Selected Poems" is a collection of his best poems written in the last fifteen years; however, the works in this collection do not show his sense of responsibility to the readers. In addition to affirming Simonov's inspiring patriotic works written during the Great Patriotic War, such as "Wait for Me," "Far in the East," and "Friend and Foe" (all of which have been translated into Chinese), the article focuses on criticizing many works that do not reflect the advanced ideas of the Soviet era, such as "Village," "Journey to Lake Bour," "Little Goldfish," "Tree," "I and You Will Never Meet Again," and "Photograph." The main shortcoming of these poems is that they do not reflect the reality of Soviet socialism, nor do they reflect the thoughts and feelings of advanced Soviet people in times of war and peace. The characters and social phenomena discussed in the poems are beyond time and era. Although most of these poems describe the struggle of Soviet people against the enemy in war, enduring hardships, bleeding, and suffering, it is not known what all of this is for. The criticism says that some poems say it is for the "motherland," but the understanding of the "motherland" is no different from the motherland before the October Socialist Revolution, and it does not show the characteristics of socialism. It is as if the Soviet Union has not built socialism, and socialism is not reflected in the character, thoughts, and feelings of Soviet people. From many works in the collection, readers cannot find the characteristics of socialist life and the vivid signs of approaching communism. Therefore, the critic says that these poems by Simonov have not undertaken the requirements of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) regarding the education of young people in its resolutions on ideological issues. These poems may even lead young people away from social interests and towards individualism. For example, there is a poem marked as written in 1947, which features a pessimistic gentleman holding a glass of wine. If the poem were not marked with the year, we could easily regard it as a work from 1847. The love songs described by the author in many poems only have "he" and "she"; but it is not written why "he" loves "her," but only regards "her" as an object of lust. Finally, the critic also pointed out, "What is the reason why a talented poet often deviates from the main hero of our era—the Soviet people—in his creation; Simonov must seriously consider all this." This criticism of Simonov's "Selected Poems" by "Komsomolskaya Pravda" is of educational significance to some of our literary and art workers who stand outside the fiery struggle, and even advocate that any kind of life has its meaning and there is no need to particularly pursue the life of mass struggle. They should more seriously consider and examine their own creations.

### 苏联“共青团真理报”批评西蒙诺夫去年出版的“诗选”

    苏联“共青团真理报”批评西蒙诺夫去年出版的“诗选”
    自七月一日“真理报”对苏联文学艺术方面的有害思想和错误作了严正的批评后，“共青团真理报”在七月十日发表了一篇题为“西蒙诺夫的诗中的活东西和死东西”的文章，批评西蒙诺夫一九五一年出版的“诗选”。据作者说，这本“诗选”是收集了他近十五年来所写的最好诗作；但这本选集中的作品，没有表示出他对读者的责任感。这篇文章除肯定了西蒙诺夫在卫国战争时期所写的鼓舞人心的爱国主义作品“等待着我吧”、“远在东方”、“友与敌”（以上的诗均有中译）等诗以外，着重地批评了“乡村”、“布尔湖旅行”、“小金鱼”、“树”、“我和你不再相见”、“照片”等许多没有反映出苏维埃时代先进思想的作品。这些诗的主要缺点是没有反映苏维埃社会主义的现实，没有反映先进的苏维埃人在战争与和平时期的思想与感情。诗里所谈的人物和社会现象是超出时间与时代以外的。这些诗大部分虽是描写战争中苏维埃人和敌人斗争，历尽艰险，流血受苦；但这一切是为了什么却不知道。这篇批评说，有的诗里说是为了“祖国”，但对“祖国”的理解，却与十月社会主义革命前的祖国没有区别，没有表现出社会主义的特征来。好像苏联没有建设社会主义，而社会主义也没有反映在苏维埃人的性格、思想和感情中。从选集里的许多作品中，读者也无法找出社会主义生活的特点和即将来临的共产主义的生动标志。因此，批评者说西蒙诺夫的这些诗没有担当起联共（布）中央关于思想问题的决议中对于作家的教育青年的要求。这些诗甚至会引导青年脱离社会利益走向个人主义。例如有一首标明写于一九四七年的诗，其中出现的是一位悲观的手拿酒杯的先生。这首诗如不标明年代，我们简直可以把它看做一八四七年的作品。作者在许多诗中描写的恋歌，只有“他”和“她”；但是“他”为什么爱“她”却没有写，只是把“她”看作情欲的对象。最后，批评者并指出“有才能的诗人在自己的创作中时常脱离我们时代的主要英雄——苏维埃人，是什么原因；对于这一切，西蒙诺夫必须严肃地考虑一下。”“共青团真理报”对西蒙诺夫“诗选”的这一批评，对我们某些站在火热的斗争之外，甚至主张任何一种生活都有它的意义，不必特别地去追求群众斗争生活的文艺工作者，是有教育意义的。他们应该更严肃地考虑与检查一下自己的创作。
