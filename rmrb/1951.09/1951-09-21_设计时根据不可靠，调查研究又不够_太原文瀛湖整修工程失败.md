    Design Based on Unreliability, Investigation and Research Insufficient
    Failure of the Wenying Lake Renovation Project in Taiyuan
    The Taiyuan Municipal People's Government recently renovated Wenying Lake, spending a considerable amount of money, but failed to fundamentally change the sanitary environment near the People's Park. The reason for this phenomenon is that the basis for the engineering design was unreliable.
    Wenying Lake is located inside the Taiyuan People's Park. After it rains, almost half of the city's rainwater flows into the lake and then slowly flows out of the city. The dirty water that citizens routinely dump also flows into the lake through underground sewers. Wenying Lake is actually a stinky puddle. In order to improve the city's sanitary environment, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Representative Conference passed a resolution to renovate Wenying Lake, which was entrusted to the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government for implementation. In the project plan, it was originally intended to pump out the stinky water, dig up all the sludge, and then put in clean water. Later, it was decided to add projects such as paving the bottom with gravel and building a lake pavilion. The Construction Bureau's Engineering Department, which was responsible for the construction project, did not conduct thorough and detailed investigation and research beforehand, and hastily designed the project, resulting in significant losses. For example, when designing the mud-digging project and calculating the mud-transporting project, it made an empiricist error. When surveying the depth of the sludge, the designers simply sat on a boat and probed a few places with bamboo poles, using this information as the main basis for the engineering design. They calculated an average depth of seven centimeters and rashly started construction. During construction, it was discovered that the average depth of the sludge was around 1.2 meters. Therefore, the original plan was to dig 12,700 cubic meters of mud, but in reality, more than 17,200 cubic meters were dug and it was still not completely removed. When designing the mud-transporting project, the designers also did not study the specific situation, but simply copied the experience of 1949, calculating the project based on transporting half a cubic meter for every cubic meter dug. However, this year's large-scale mud-digging was different from the previous situation, and the dug-up mud could no longer be dried and transported as before. As a result, the transportation costs exceeded the budget. After these two projects exceeded the budget, they seriously affected the continuation of the project. Although an additional 150 million yuan was budgeted later, it still could not completely solve the problem.
    Another mistake in the engineering design was the failure to correctly recognize the role of Wenying Lake in buffering street rainwater. During construction, in order to prevent rainwater from flowing into the lake again, a new sewer more than 1,300 meters long was built. However, later facts proved that this sewer, which was one meter wide and 0.9 meters high, could not completely replace the role of Wenying Lake. After two heavy rains in August, the water势汹汹 (shi xiong xiong meaning the water was surging) for a time. If water was released at Haizi Bian (a pond in Haizi Bian Park), the rainwater would flow into Wenying Lake again. If water was not released, the sewer's capacity was insufficient, and the water on the road would flood into the residences of some streets. In the end, they were forced to release water, causing the unfinished mud-digging project in Wenying Lake to come to a standstill.
    Because of these mistakes, the Wenying Lake renovation project cost more than 500 million yuan and took more than two months. As a result, the sludge was not completely removed, the gravel was not fully paved, and rainwater still flowed into the lake, failing to fundamentally change the sanitary environment near the People's Park. If a thorough renovation is to be carried out again, it will be necessary to drain the water, dig the mud, and start from scratch.

### 设计时根据不可靠，调查研究又不够  太原文瀛湖整修工程失败

    设计时根据不可靠，调查研究又不够
    太原文瀛湖整修工程失败
    太原市人民政府最近整修文瀛湖；花钱不少，但却没有从根本上改变人民公园附近的卫生环境。造成这种现象的原因，是工程设计的根据不可靠。
    文瀛湖在太原人民公园里面，下雨以后，差不多太原半个城的雨水都要流到湖里，然后慢慢流出城外；市民们日常倒下的脏水，也从地下水道流入湖中，文瀛湖实际上是一个臭水坑。为了改变城市的卫生环境，市各界人民代表会议作了整修文瀛湖的决议，交太原市人民政府执行。工程计划中，原定把臭水抽完，把污泥挖尽，然后放入清水，后来又决定增加铺石砾底、修湖心亭等工程。负责修建工程的建设局工程处，在事前没有经过周密细致的调查研究，就草率设计，致使工程发生很大损失。比如在设计挖泥工程和计算运泥工程时，就犯了经验主义的错误。设计人员勘察污泥深度时，只是坐在船上用竹竿探了几个地方就将此项资料当成了设计工程的主要根据，只算了个七公寸深的平均数字，就冒然施工。施工时，才发现污泥深度平均在一公尺二左右。因此，原计划挖一万二千七百方泥，实际上挖了一万七千二百多方还没有挖尽。在设计运泥工程时，设计人员也没有研究具体情况，只是原封不动地搬用了一九四九年的经验，按挖一方运半方来计算工程。但今年是大规模的挖泥，不同于以前的情况，挖出的泥不可能再像以前一样晒干再运。因而，运费便超过了预算。这两项工程超过预算后，便严重地影响了工程的继续进行。后来虽然追加了一亿五千万元的预算，仍然不能全部解决问题。
    这个工程设计的另一个错误，是没有正确地认识到文瀛湖缓和街道雨水的作用。施工时，为了不让雨水再流入湖里，曾经新筑了一条一千三百多公尺长的下水道，但后来事实证明，这条一公尺宽、九公寸高的下水道，还不能完全代替文瀛湖的作用。八月份两场大雨以后，一时水势汹汹，若在海子边（海子边公园中一池塘）放水，雨水就要再流入文瀛湖，若不放水，下水道容量不够，路上的水就要灌入某些街道的住宅。最后被迫放水，使文瀛湖里未完成的挖泥工程停顿下来。
    就因为这些错误，整修文瀛湖的工程花了五亿多元，费了两个多月的时间，结果是污泥没有挖尽，石砾没有铺全，雨水又流入湖里，仍然没有从根本上改变了人民公园附近的卫生环境。如果再要澈底整修，还得抽水、挖泥，从头作起。
