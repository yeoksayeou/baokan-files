    Personnel of the Hebei Provincial Finance and Trust Company's Shijiazhuang Branch
    Should Not Deposit Public Funds into Private Money Shops

    On August 20th of this year, the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Hebei Provincial Finance and Trust Company sent the company's purchasing agents, Li Shikun and He Renzhen, to Shanghai to purchase goods. After arriving in Shanghai, they did not go through the local relevant departments to complete the procurement procedures, but used private connections to deposit more than 500 million yuan of public funds into the Shanghai private Yingchun Money Shop and made purchases haphazardly in the market. It was not until they spent over 220 million yuan in payments for goods that the North China Regional Joint Purchasing and Marketing Office in Shanghai discovered this. I believe that the behavior of the purchasing agents of the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Hebei Provincial Finance and Trust Company, who knowingly violate the law and undermine the state's cash management policy, should be punished.

### 河北省财政信托公司石家庄分公司人员  不应将公款存入私营钱庄

    河北省财政信托公司石家庄分公司人员
    不应将公款存入私营钱庄编辑同志：
    今年八月二十日，河北省财政信托公司石家庄分公司派该公司采购员李世昆、贺仁真到上海采购货物，他们到上海后也不和当地有关部门办理在沪采购手续，就以私人关系把五亿多公款存入上海私营营春钱庄，并在市场上乱行采购。直到他们投放出二亿二千多万货款时，才被华北区驻沪联合购销处发觉。我认为河北省财政信托公司石家庄分公司采购员这种知法犯法破坏国家现金管理政策的行为，是应受到处罚的。  张维德
