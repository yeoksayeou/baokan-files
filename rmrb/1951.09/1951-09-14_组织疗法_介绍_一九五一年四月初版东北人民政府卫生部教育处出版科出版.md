Introduction to “Tissue Therapy”
    Published by the Education Department Publishing Section of the Northeast People's Government Health Department, First Edition, Early April 1951

    Tissue therapy is a new medical method, and it is still considered new even in the Soviet Union. The inventor, Filatov, transplanted refrigerated cadaver corneas into the corneal opacity (i.e., the turbid area) of patients' eyes and found that the surrounding turbid parts of the cornea gradually became transparent. This phenomenon inevitably led the inventor to think that corneal transplantation is not just a mechanical action, that is, not only because the opaque part of the cornea is replaced with a transparent cornea, allowing the eye to see again; in fact, a therapeutic effect also occurs, causing the surrounding opaque parts to become transparent again.
    As a result of research and experimentation, Mr. Filatov was convinced that taking various tissues from human bodies or other animals (more recently, he learned to use plant tissues), refrigerating them, and then transplanting them under the patient's skin—not necessarily at the affected area, but simply planting the tissue in another part of the body, such as under the skin of the upper chest—has great efficacy for some diseases. At first glance, this medical method seems strange: why can taking an unrelated (different) tissue and planting it in another part of the body cure various different diseases, such as bronchial asthma, gastric ulcers, and high blood pressure? Filatov's explanation is: When the transplanted material is stored in the refrigerator, the surrounding conditions change because the tissue encounters low temperatures and loses normal nutrients, etc., which probably produces a substance. When the tissue is inoculated back into the patient's body, it can rely on the action of this substance to give the human body a kind of stimulation to restore health.
    The complete book "Tissue Therapy" has a total of one hundred and fifty-four pages and collects twenty-eight articles of varying lengths. Most of them are translated from the papers of Soviet experts; a few were written by Chinese doctors themselves. The book explains or discusses the origin of tissue therapy, what tissue materials are used, how to collect them, how to process them, how to transplant them, what diseases can be treated, and why this therapy can cure diseases (starting from general explanations and going to specialized discussions); it also discusses the treatment of disabled veterans in the Soviet Patriotic War and the relationship between acupuncture and tissue implantation therapy. Therefore, this book is useful for medical workers and medical researchers.
    Tissue therapy is a new medical method that plants tissues in the human body and uses the biogenic stimulants produced by those tissues to help the human body increase its resistance and regenerative power against certain diseases. This is its therapeutic effect. We should study and learn this new medical method.
    This book is a collection of translations, and it is inevitable that there will be some repetitions; also, it was translated by several translators, so the style of translation will inevitably be somewhat inconsistent. For example, the names of the original authors have been translated into Chinese characters in some articles, while others still have the original text. At present, there are not many people who have studied Russian, so it would be more appropriate to translate them all into Chinese. Academic terms are also inconsistent, such as hormone, which is written as 荷尔萌 in some places. For the genus name of aloe, Alo?, the A is lowercase in some places (the first letter of the genus name should be capitalized). In addition, Mytilus edulis was originally translated as "海产蛤贝" (sea clam), but it can actually be translated as "淡菜" (mussel) (produced in the Baltic Sea, etc.). Some sentences are awkward, such as "重笃了兰尾浸润..." (page 81), where "了" may be a mistake for "之" (because there is a phrase elsewhere "重笃之兰尾浸润奏以良效"). Also, it is not very smooth to call people with morphine addiction "吗啡瘾客" (morphine addicts). Etc.
    Also, some books often write "假设" (hypothesis) as "假说" (conjecture), and this book is also like that. The two words "假设" (hypothesis) are often called "假定" (assumption) in spoken language. According to certain phenomena, it is inferred that it is so, but there is still a lack of proof, but it is not completely without basis, so it is called a hypothesis (or assumption). Some also write it as speculation. If it is written as conjecture, the meaning is somewhat different. I think it is better to write it as a hypothesis.
    I have only written these simple introductions and opinions about this book. I am an amateur in both medicine and Russian, so I am writing this as a reader, not as an expert. The purpose of writing this short article is to introduce the book on the one hand, and also to tell the publisher and editors that there are still areas in the book that need to be improved.
    Since the Central Ministry of Health issued the "Instructions on Vigorously Promoting 'Tissue Therapy'" in March of this year, many places have paid attention to this new medical method. Tens of thousands of people across the country have now benefited from tissue therapy. According to a large number of cases that already exist in various places, tissue therapy is about seven or eight tenths effective for skin ulcers, peptic ulcers, tuberculous lymphadenitis, certain eye diseases, bronchial asthma, neurasthenia, skin diseases (such as ringworm), neuralgia, scar contractures, etc. These facts have gradually changed the conservative views of some medical workers who held skeptical and exclusive ideas about tissue therapy, and they have admitted the efficacy of tissue therapy. However, although tissue therapy is a very good treatment method, it is not a panacea. In the process of promotion, some tendencies of blind abuse have occurred. The future work should be to continue to work hard to publicize and promote, overcome the psychology of doubt and distrust, and at the same time prevent the phenomenon of careless abuse. Medical workers across the country should follow the spirit of "On Practice" and further test and enrich the theory of tissue therapy in the process of practice. I sincerely hope that more and better articles and books discussing tissue therapy will be published in the near future.

    “组织疗法”介绍
    一九五一年四月初版东北人民政府卫生部教育处出版科出版
    周建人
    组织疗法是一种新医法，就是在苏联也还算是新的。发明者费拉托夫把冷藏过的死人角膜移植于病人角膜生翳处（即溷浊处），发见周围角膜溷浊部分也渐渐变为透明。这种现象必然会使发明者想到：角膜的移植不仅是一种机械作用，即不仅因生翳的角膜部分换上了透明的角膜，眼睛又能看见东西；实际上，还发生了一种治疗作用，使周围生翳部分又重新变为透明。
    费拉托夫氏进行研究和试验的结果，确信取人体或其他动物体的多种组织（近来更知道使用植物组织），冷藏后移植在病人皮下——不必移植在患处，只要把那组织种在身体的别一处地方，例如胸侧上部皮下——对于有些疾病有很大的功效。这种医法初看似乎很奇怪：为什么取不相关的（不相同的）一种组织，种在别一处地方，能使各种不同的疾病——如支气管喘息，胃溃疡，及高血压等病好起来呢？费拉托夫的说明是：移植的材料藏在冰箱里时，因为组织遇到低温，及失去正常的养料等等，周围的条件改变，大概会产生一种物质。当再把组织接种在病人体内时，能依靠这种物质的作用，给人体一种刺激，使他恢复健康。
    “组织疗法”全书共一百五十四面，收集了长短不等的文章二十八篇。其中大部分是从苏联专家的论文里译出来的；有几篇是中国医师自己写的。对于组织疗法的由来，采用什么组织材料，如何采取，如何处理，怎样移植，可以治哪些病，以及这种疗法为什么能治病，本书都有说明或讨论（从一般性的讲起，直到专题性的讨论）；对于苏联卫国战争中残废者的治疗，及针灸疗法与组织埋藏疗法的关系等都有论列。因此，这本书对于医务工作者和医学研究者都有用处。
    组织疗法是一种新的医疗方法，把组织种植在人体内，借用那组织产生的生物原刺激素来帮助人体增加对某些疾病的抵抗力与再生力，这就是它的治疗作用。我们对于这种新医法，是应当研究和学习的。
    这本书是辑译的，里面不免有些重复的地方；又是好几位译者分译的，译文体裁上当然多少会有点不一致。例如有几篇原著者的名字已译成汉字，有几篇仍写着原文。目前学过俄文的人还不多，应以都译成汉文较妥。学术名辞也不一致，如荷尔蒙，有的地方写作荷尔萌。芦荟属名Alo?，有的地方A字是小写（属名第一字母是应当大写的）。此外如Mytilus edulis，原译“海产蛤贝”，其实可译作“淡菜”（波罗的海等处产）。有的句子生硬，例如“重笃了兰尾浸润……”（八十一面），“了”字可能是“之”字之误（因他处有“重笃之兰尾浸润奏以良效”一语）。又如称有吗啡瘾的人为“吗啡瘾客”也不大顺口。等等。
    又，有些书上，常常把“假设”写作“假说”，本书也是这样。“假设”两字在口语里常叫假定，依据某些现象，推论起来是如此，但还缺乏证明，可是也并非完全没有依据，就叫它假设（或假定）。也有写作臆说的。如写作假说意思有些不同了，我觉得以写假设为是。
    对于本书，只写了这一些简单的介绍和意见。我对于医学及俄文都是外行，所以只是以一个读者的身份来写，不是以专家的资格来写的。写这篇短文的目的是一方面把这书作一介绍，另一方面也告诉出版者及编者，本书尚有应注意改进的地方。
    从今年三月中央卫生部发布了“关于组织推行‘组织疗法’的指示”以来，很多地方已注意到这种新的医疗法了。全国各地现在已有成万的人受到组织疗法的益处。根据各地已有的大量病例来看，组织疗法对于皮肤溃疡、消化性溃疡、淋巴结核、某些眼病、支气管喘息、神经衰弱、皮肤病（如癣），神经痛、瘢痕挛缩等症，大约十分之七八是有效的。这些事实已使得某些对组织疗法抱着怀疑和排斥思想的医务工作者逐渐改变保守的看法，承认组织疗法的功效了。不过组织疗法虽是一种很好的治疗方法，却并非是万能的。在推广的过程中，已发生了若干盲目滥用的偏向。今后的工作应是继续努力宣传推广，克服怀疑与不信任的心理，同时防止草率滥用的现象。全国医务工作者应该遵循“实践论”的精神，在实践过程中进一步检验和充实组织疗法的理论。我衷心地希望在不久的将来会有更多和更好的论述组织疗法的文章和书籍问世。
