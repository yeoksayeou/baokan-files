    Editor's Note: Recently, in the "Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival" held in Berlin, our country's dance and the Soviet Union's dance jointly won the first prize in the international dance competition. Here, we publish a letter from Berlin from seven Jingju Opera performers, including Zhang Yunxi, who participated in our country's classical dance performance. This letter reports the enthusiastic welcome that Chinese Jingju Opera dance received during performances abroad. Prior to this, this newspaper published a letter from Mr. Zhang Yunxi and others to friends in the Beijing Jingju Opera community from Manchuria on their way abroad on August 3rd. In that letter, they expressed their "willingness to participate in the overseas performance with maximum effort and win glory for the motherland." Now they have gloriously completed the task of performing abroad, which is worth celebrating.

    Dean Mei, Vice Deans Cheng, Luo, and Ma, and please forward to all dear comrades:

    We sent a letter when we passed through Manchuria; you should have received it. We have always been thinking of our respected leaders and dear comrades with infinite longing. We are constantly remembering and reviewing the instructions and concern given to us by the leaders and comrades before our departure.

    Now, we would like to report on our journey and the performance situation in Berlin.

    On July 27th, we arrived in Moscow and rested for two days. We departed on the 29th and arrived in Berlin on the 31st. During the journey, like in the spring trip to Shanghai and the summer trip to Korea, we several people never stopped studying and working. Even during this tense and pleasant journey, we carefully improved all the programs we were going to perform, condensed the time as much as possible, strengthened and beautified the dance, and tried our best to introduce the excellent Jingju Opera art of our great people's motherland. Now that we have successfully performed, we are still refining and rehearsing.

    The grand International Youth Festival opened in Berlin on August 5th, with participants from more than ninety countries. Our Chinese delegation was very popular. When we stepped into the venue, the thunderous applause of more than ten thousand people in the audience did not stop. The solemn, respectful, and joyful shouts of "Mao Zedong" resounded throughout the venue. We were immersed in such a joyous international friendship and enthusiasm, which made us deeply feel the glory of the people of the victorious New China under the leadership of Chairman Mao!

    On this day, there was a football match between the Soviet Union and Germany, and four large collective dances by German youth (each with two or three thousand participants). There were no other cultural programs.

    On the evening of the 6th, at the "Comedy Theater" - a magnificent and historically significant old theater - our Chinese art troupe performed the most brilliant comprehensive program, including music, dance, acrobatics, singing, and so on. All 1,400 seats were filled, and each program was warmly welcomed. Among these programs, the most popular were the trick cycling, the red silk dance, and our "New Crossroads." On the 7th, we entertained President Pieck and heads of delegations from various countries at the gymnasium. The program remained the same, and the welcoming situation was the same as on the 6th. On the 12th, we performed in a suburban park 40 kilometers away from the central area of Berlin, with an audience of 18,000 people. Our "New Crossroads" was changed to the "finale" performance. This performance of "New Crossroads" was the most brilliant.

    At noon on the 13th, the International Dance Competition was held at the "National Theater." Our Chinese side performed a total of five programs: the red silk dance, the butterfly dance, the Tibetan dance; and two of our Jingju Opera dances, one was "New Crossroads" and the other was "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger." "New Crossroads" took three curtain calls, and the applause lasted for four or five minutes. The audience couldn't help but stomp their feet, which sounded like thunder. This was the most satisfactory and welcome expression. After the performance, we rushed to Friedrich Park before we even finished changing, and the finale was still "New Crossroads," with an audience of more than 20,000 people. The result was still very good. In total, on this day, we performed one "Fighting the Tiger" and two "New Crossroads" in three hours.

    On the 14th and 15th, we performed "Fighting the Tiger" each time, and the audience was extremely satisfied. The 14th was an international evening party, jointly performed by various countries. Originally, our Chinese side was scheduled to perform the "Red Silk Dance," but because the stage conditions were not suitable, it was changed to "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger." This evening party had programs from twenty countries, and the "finale" was from the Soviet Union, our elder brother. We were the "penultimate act," performing on a flat ground in a living room. The marble floor was covered with a very thin five-foot-wide rectangular carpet, surrounded by large stone pillars and distinguished guests. Although under such dangerous and difficult conditions, we still performed with full spirit, and the result was as before, highly praised by the distinguished guests.

    Today is the "International Dance Competition Awards Day." Let's all be happy. Our Chinese dance collective won first place, standing shoulder to shoulder with our Soviet elder brother. Both countries won first place! Our Chinese music is second place, and the Soviet elder brother is first place. This is the glory of Chairman Mao! Dean, comrades, this is your glory! It is the glory of the people's artists! It is the glory of our great people's motherland!

    During this trip abroad, the comrades performed very well. None of us have forgotten or violated the promise we made to the leaders and comrades before our departure: to unite and love each other, help each other, study hard, work diligently, and win glory for our great motherland. We also encountered many difficulties, but as soon as we thought of Chairman Mao and the great motherland, we no longer knew what hardship or difficulty was.

    Comrades, please rest assured, the leaders of our delegation are taking good care of us, and we are all very healthy. Everyone has gained weight compared to before going abroad.

    There is also one thing: one set of the double knives used for "New Crossroads" has broken; the tiger fork used for "Fighting the Tiger" has also broken because of fighting the tiger too much. Please customize two more sets for us and find a way to bring them here.

    In Berlin, the capital of this Democratic Germany, we will probably stay for two more months. If the leaders and comrades have any instructions or letters, please send them to the Chinese Embassy in Berlin, forwarded to the Dance Team of the Chinese Youth Delegation's Cultural Troupe. We can receive them no matter which country we go to. We wish you good health and send our regards!

    我们在世界青年联欢节上的演出
    ——张云溪等京剧工作者由柏林的来信
    编者按：最近，在柏林举行的“第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节”中，我国的舞蹈和苏联的舞蹈同得国际舞蹈竞赛的第一奖。在这里，我们发表参加我国古典舞蹈演出的京剧工作者张云溪等七人寄自柏林的来信。这封信报告了中国的京剧舞蹈在国外演出受到热烈欢迎的情形。在此以前，本报已于八月三日发表了张云溪先生等在出国途中，自满洲里寄给北京京剧界朋友们的一封信。他们在那封信里，表示“愿以最大努力，参加出国的演出，为祖国争取光荣。”现在他们光荣地完成了出国演出的任务，这是值得庆贺的。梅院长，程、罗、马副院长，并请转全体亲爱的同志们：
    我们经过满洲里的时候，曾经寄上一封信，收到了吧。我们一直是以无限怀念的心情想念着我们敬爱的首长和亲爱的同志们的。行前，首长和同志们给予我们的指示和关怀，我们是时刻的记忆着和温习着的。
    现在，我们来报告我们的行程，和在柏林演出的情况。
    七月二十七日，我们抵达莫斯科，休息了两天，二十九日出发，三十一日就到达了柏林，在行车的旅途中，和春季去上海，夏季到朝鲜一样，我们几个人始终没有放下研究工作，就是在这紧张而又愉快的行程中，我们把所有要演出的节目都细心的加了工，尽量的紧缩时间，加强并美化舞蹈，尽我们的力量想尽一切办法，把我们伟大的人民祖国的优秀的京剧艺术介绍出来，现在我们虽然已经成功地演出了，但仍然是精益求精的做加工的排练。
    盛大的国际青年联欢节是于八月五日在柏林开幕，一共有九十多个国家参加。咱们中国代表团备受欢迎，当我们才一踏进会场的时候，全场十几万人雷动的掌声不停。“毛泽东”庄严、敬慕、欢悦的呼声响彻了全场，我们沉浸在这样欢腾的国际友爱热情中，使我们深深的感到在毛主席领导下的胜利的新中国的人民的光荣！
    这一天，有苏、德两国的足球比赛，和德国青年的四个大集体舞（每个都有两三千人参加）没有其他文艺节目。
    六日晚在“喜剧剧院”——这是一座富丽堂皇，有历史意义的古老剧院，这一晚便是上演咱们中国文艺工作团最精采的一台综合节目，包括了音乐、舞蹈、杂技、歌唱等等。一千四百个座位都坐得满满的，每一个节目都受到热烈的欢迎。在这些节目中最受欢迎的是车技、红绸舞，还有一个就是我们的“新三岔口”。七日在体育馆招待皮克总统和各国代表团负责人，节目照常，欢迎的情况和六日相同。十二日到离柏林中心区四十公里的郊外公园表演，观众一万八千人，我们的“新三岔口”改成“大轴”演出了，这场“新三岔口”演的最精采。
    十三日中午在“国家剧院”举行国际舞蹈竞赛，咱们中国方面一共演出了五个节目：红绸舞、扑蝶舞、藏民舞；另有两个节目是我们的京剧舞，一个是“新三岔口”，一个是“武松打虎”。“新三岔口”谢幕达三次之多，掌声不绝达四、五分钟之久，观众情不自禁地两足乱踏，简直就像是打雷一样，这是最为满意，最为欢迎的表现。完戏之后，未等卸完装就赶到腓特烈公园演出，大轴仍然是“新三岔口”，观众二万多人，成绩依然是很好的。总计，在这一天，三小时内连演了一个“打虎”两个“新三岔口”。
    十四、十五两日，各演一场“打虎”，观众极为满意。十四日是一个国际晚会，是各个国家联合演出的。原定咱们中国方面演“红绸舞”，因舞台条件不适宜，才改换“武松打虎”。这一个晚会共有二十个国家的节目，“大轴”是苏联老大哥的，咱们是“压轴”，是在一座客厅里的平地上演出，大理石的地上铺上了一块极薄的五尺宽的长方毯子，四面都是大石柱子，周遭又都是贵宾，虽然是在这样危险和困难的条件下，我们仍然是精神饱满的演出，成绩如前，极得贵宾们的好评。
    今天是“国际舞蹈竞赛评奖日”，让咱们大家都高兴吧，咱们中国的舞蹈集体的得了第一名，和苏联老大哥比肩而立，两国都是第一名！咱们中国的音乐是第二名，苏联老大哥第一名。这是毛主席的光荣！院长、同志们，这是你们的光荣！是人民文艺工作者的光荣！是咱们伟大的人民祖国的光荣！
    这次出国，同志们表现的都很好，我们大家都没有忘记也没有违背了行前我们对首长和同志们的诺言：团结友爱，互相帮助，努力学习，辛勤工作，为我们伟大的祖国争光荣。我们也碰到许多困难，但是一想到毛主席和伟大的祖国，我们就不知道什么是辛苦，什么叫困难了。
    同志们放心我们吧，我们团的领导同志照顾我们很好，我们身体都很健壮，大家都比出国前胖了。
    还有一件事就是演“新三岔口”用的双刀已经坏了一份；“打虎”用的虎叉因为打虎打多了，叉也坏了。请给我们再定制两份，设法捎来吧。
    在柏林，这民主德国的首都，我们大约还有两个月的停留。首长和同志们如有指示和信件时，请寄德国柏林中国大使馆转中国青年代表团文工团舞蹈队。无论我们走到那个国家是都能收到的。谨祝健康。并致敬礼！
