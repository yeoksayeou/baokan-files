A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Self-Criticism Regarding the "Twenty-Five Thousand Li Long March" Comic Book

    To the Editor:

    After reading the "Letters from Readers" column in the People's Daily on September 5th, we saw Comrade Wu Shaofang's correct criticism of our bookstore's published comic book "Twenty-Five Thousand Li Long March." We fully accept the serious shortcomings he pointed out, such as referring to ethnic minorities as "barbarians," referring to ethnic minority areas as "barbarian areas," as well as "distorting the depiction of the Red Army casually pulling up radishes from the fields of the masses to eat," and "a pursuing enemy soldier having a red star painted on his hat, making it impossible to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves." We will immediately begin to revise these shortcomings. We have examined the reasons for these shortcomings. The main reason is that we did not do a conscientious job of publishing, with a spirit of being highly responsible to the people. The book has been printed eleven times, and although it has been revised once, it still has the above serious shortcomings. This proves that there is still a careless style in our work, and that there is still more or less a discriminatory attitude towards ethnic minorities in our thinking. This is something we should deeply examine.

### 上海华东书店  关于“二万五千里长征”连环画的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    上海华东书店
    关于“二万五千里长征”连环画的检讨编辑同志：
    我们看到九月五日的人民日报“读者来信”栏内，武少芳同志对我们书店出版的“二万五千里长征”连环画提出了正确的批评，他所指出的把少数民族称为“蛮人”，把少数民族地区称为“蛮人地区”，以及“歪曲地描写了红军随便在地里拔群众的萝卜吃”，“一个被红军追击的敌兵帽子上画了一颗红星，弄得敌我不分”等严重缺点，我们完全接受，并于即日着手修正。我们检讨发生这些缺点的原因，主要是没有以向人民高度负责的精神，认真地做好出版工作。该书已印行十一版，虽曾修正过一次，但仍有以上严重缺点，这证明在我们的工作中还存在着粗枝大叶的作风，在思想上还多多少少存在着歧视少数民族的思想，这是值得我们深刻检讨的。上海华东书店出版部
