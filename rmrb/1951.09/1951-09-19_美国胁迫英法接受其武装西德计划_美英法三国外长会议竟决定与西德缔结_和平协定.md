    The US Coerces Britain and France to Accept its Plan to Arm West Germany
    The Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the US, Britain and France Decides to Conclude a "Peace Agreement" with West Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting in Washington on September 12, 13, and 14. The US government convened this meeting mainly to coerce Britain and France into fully accepting its plan to arm West Germany in order to intensify war preparations in Europe. As a result of the meeting, the United States, Britain, and France have decided to conclude a so-called "peace agreement" with the West German puppet government to replace the current occupation regulations. The joint communique of the three foreign ministers' meeting has publicly announced that the three foreign ministers have reached an agreement on "certain general principles" to guide the High Commissioners of the three countries stationed in Germany in negotiating this agreement with the West German government.
    This step taken by the United States, Britain, and France in their relations with West Germany aims to carry out a de facto unilateral "peace" with West Germany, granting West Germany false "independence" and "sovereignty," so that West Germany can participate in the war preparations of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Regarding this point, the joint communique of the three foreign ministers' meeting bluntly stated: The "guiding principle of the policy" of the three countries "remains to merge the Federal Republic (i.e., the West German puppet state) into the European group on an equal footing, while the European group itself is included in the developing Atlantic group."
    Despite the repeated claims by the United States, Britain, and France that West Germany will be granted "independence" after the conclusion of the so-called "peace agreement," in reality, this will not change the current state of occupation of West Germany, and West Germany must provide cannon fodder for the North Atlantic aggressor army. The three foreign ministers clearly announced in the joint communique that the three countries would "retain certain privileges" when concluding the new agreement, including the privilege "regarding the stationing of armed forces in Germany and the protection of the security of these forces." At the same time, a United Press International dispatch from Washington on September 13 revealed that the "quid pro quo" for West Germany to conclude a "peace agreement" with the three countries "is that Germany provides troops to participate in the European Allied Forces and fully assists in the implementation of the Schuman economic plan." Now the joint communique of the three foreign ministers' meeting has grimly announced that the so-called "peace agreement" should "take effect simultaneously with the agreement on Germany's participation in Western defense," and the core content of the so-called Western "defense" agreement is to organize a "European Army" as part of the North Atlantic aggressor army. The US, British, and French imperialists are thus imposing the shackles of war on the West German people.
    On the issue of the "European Army," the United States has forced France at this meeting to agree that Eisenhower can rebuild the West German Nazi army before an agreement is reached on the organization of the "European Army." At the same time, the United States forced Britain at the meeting to agree to the Pleven Plan and the Schuman Plan, that is, to organize a Western European military and economic group under US control. The formation of this group is to weaken Britain's position in Western Europe, which is why Britain has always opposed it.
    Although the United States forced Britain and France to make further concessions at the three foreign ministers' meeting, its long-term plan to immediately establish a West German army did not achieve a definite result, which is precisely what the United States has long sought to achieve by all means. The official US Information Service acknowledged in a telegram on September 12 on the three foreign ministers' meeting: "Although the three foreign ministers reached a general agreement on the principle of the (European Army), there was no final agreement. Moreover, it is expected that no concrete action will be taken on this issue at the upcoming meeting of the Atlantic Pact Council." Although the wishes of the United States were far from being realized. Therefore, "Voice of America" commentator Swain, in a commentary on the Washington meeting on September 13, helplessly insisted that the convening of this meeting was "somewhat accidental" and that it would be a "mistake" to "expect the three foreign ministers to make far-reaching and final decisions on important issues in Washington."
    Standing in the way of the war plans of the Washington meeting is the huge peaceful strength of the people of the world, especially the people of Western Europe. The anger of the Western European people towards the revival of German militarism has made the bourgeois newspapers feel uneasy. Agence France-Presse admitted that the Paris newspapers expressed "worry and unease" about the Washington meeting communique, believing that it "contained dangers." It is precisely for this reason that after the news that France had agreed to Eisenhower's advance formation of the West German army on September 14, the French Foreign Ministry had to hastily issue a statement on the same day, denying that the Washington meeting had made a decision to establish a German army "immediately," in an attempt to quell the anger of the people. This alone is enough to show that there are still serious difficulties for the United States to realize its war preparation policy.

### 美国胁迫英法接受其武装西德计划  美英法三国外长会议竟决定与西德缔结“和平协定”

    美国胁迫英法接受其武装西德计划
    美英法三国外长会议竟决定与西德缔结“和平协定”
    【新华社十八日讯】美、英、法三国外长会议已于九月十二、十三、十四日在华盛顿举行。美国政府召开这个会议主要是为了要胁迫英法两国完全接受其武装西德的计划，以便在欧洲加紧备战。会议结果，美英法三国已经决定与西德傀儡政府缔结所谓“和平协定”来代替目前的占领法规。三外长会议公报已公开宣布：三国外长对指导三国驻德高级专员公署与西德政府进行缔结这项协定谈判的“某些总的原则已获致协议”。
    美英法三国在对西德关系上所采取的这一步骤，其目的是企图与西德进行事实上的片面“媾和”，给西德以虚伪的“独立”和“主权”，使西德能参加北大西洋侵略集团的备战活动。对于这一点，三外长会议公报露骨地声称：三国“政策的指导原则仍是在平等基础上把联邦共和国（即西德傀儡国家）合并于欧洲集团之中，而欧洲集团本身又包括在正在发展着的大西洋集团之内”。
    尽管美、英、法三国一再标榜缔结所谓“和平协定”以后，将给予西德以“独立”，但是，实际上，这丝毫也不能改变西德目前的被占领状态，而且西德必须为北大西洋侵略军提供炮灰。三外长在会议公报中明白宣布：三国在缔结新协定时要“保留某些特权”，其中有“关于在德国驻扎武装部队与保护这些部队之安全”的特权。同时，合众社华盛顿九月十三日电曾透露：西德与三国缔结“和平协定”的“交换条件是德国出军队参加欧洲联军，并充分协助实施舒曼经济计划”。现在三外长会议的公报已狰狞地宣布说：所谓“和平协定”要与德国“参加西方防御的协定同时生效”，而所谓西方“防御”协定的中心内容，就是要组织“欧洲军”，作为北大西洋侵略军的一部分。美英法帝国主义就这样地把战争的枷锁强加在西德人民身上。
    在“欧洲军”问题上，美国在这次会议上已逼迫法国同意：在“欧洲军”组织问题未取得协议前，艾森豪威尔可以先行重建西德纳粹军队。同时，美国又在会上逼迫英国同意普利文计划和舒曼计划，即组织美国操纵下的西欧大陆军事及经济集团，这个集团的组成，是用以削弱英国在西欧的地位的因而也是英国一直反对的。
    美国虽然在三外长会议上强迫英法作了进一步的屈服，但是，它立即建立西德军的长远计划却并没有能得到一个确定的结果，而这正是美国长期以来即千方百计企图达到的。美国官方的美国新闻处在九月十二日就三外长会议发表的电讯中承认：“三外长虽就（欧洲军的）原则获致了一般的协议，但没有最后约定。而且，预料在即将到来的大西洋公约理事会会议上也不会就这个问题采取具体行动。”虽然，美国的愿望是远没有达到的。所以“美国之音”的评论员史温在九月十三日发表关于华盛顿会议的评论时，竟无可奈何地硬说这次会议的召开“有些偶然”，“要盼望三国外长在华盛顿做出关于重要问题的影响深远和最后的决定来”，是一种“错误”。
    横梗在华盛顿会议的战争计划前面的是全世界人民特别是西欧人民巨大的和平力量。西欧人民对于德国军国主义复活的愤怒，已使资产阶级报纸感到不妙。法新社承认：巴黎各报对于华盛顿会议公报表示“忧虑不安”，认为“含有危险性的”。正是因为这个原故，在九月十四日法国同意艾森豪威尔先行编组西德军队的消息传出以后，法国外交部不得不在当天就慌忙发表声明，否认华盛顿会议曾有“立即”建立德国军队的决定，企图以此平息人民的愤怒。仅是这一点，就足以说明美国要实现备战政策还存在着严重的困难。
