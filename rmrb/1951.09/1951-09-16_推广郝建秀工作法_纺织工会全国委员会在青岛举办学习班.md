Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, September 4th: The All-China Textile Workers' Union has opened a training class in Qingdao on the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to promote it. The class began on August 22nd and ended on the 30th. The trainees were representatives from all over the country who had attended the Qingdao Municipal Cotton Spinning Fine Yarn Workers' Representative Conference, totaling 119 people. Hao Jianxiu herself served as the teacher for the class, with personnel from the Qingdao Municipal Hao Jianxiu Work Method Promotion Group serving as instructors. The learning steps were to first understand the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, then learn Hao Jianxiu's basic movements, and finally learn Hao Jianxiu's advantages such as her regularity, planning, and rational allocation of work time. When the trainees first entered the machine sections for practice, they were somewhat flustered. The common problem was that they could not rationally allocate time during patrols, thus failing to squeeze out more time for cleaning work. However, after repeated practice and group discussions, all the trainees learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Some veteran workers from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shijiazhuang, and other places, such as Yan Jinfen, Zhu Jiu, and Xu Xiaoen, originally had good skills and were willing to learn with an open mind, so their learning results were better. During the learning process, technical personnel from various places also gained a clearer understanding of how to summarize advanced experiences and how to follow the mass line. The trainees all had high confidence in promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. At the graduation ceremony of the training class, Chen Shaomin, chairman of the All-China Textile Workers' Union, personally awarded each trainee with excellent grades an apron with the words "Award for Hao Jianxiu Worker" on it. All the trainees unanimously stated that they would resolutely complete the glorious task of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method after returning to their factories.

    推广郝建秀工作法
    纺织工会全国委员会在青岛举办学习班
    【新华社青岛四日电】中国纺织工会全国委员会为推广郝建秀工作法在青岛开办了郝建秀工作法学习班。该班于八月二十二日开学，三十日结束。参加学习班的学员是出席过青岛市棉纺细纱职工代表会议的全国各地代表，共一百十九人。学习班由郝建秀当教师，并由青岛市郝建秀工作法推广组的人员担任指导员。学习步骤是先领会郝建秀工作法的精神，然后学习郝建秀的基本动作，最后学习郝建秀有规律、有计划、合理地分配工作时间等优点。学员们开始进入车档实习时有些慌张，普遍的毛病是在巡回中不能合理地分配时间，挤出更多的时间来做清洁工作。但后来经过反覆实习和小组讨论，全体学员都学会了郝建秀工作法。从上海、杭州、天津、武汉、石家庄等地来的一些老工人，如阎金芬、朱玖、许小恩等，原来技术就好，又肯虚心学习，所以学习成绩较好。各地技术人员在学习中，对如何总结先进经验、如何走群众路线也有了更明确的认识。学员们对推广郝建秀工作法的信心都很高。在学习班毕业典礼上，中国纺织工会全国委员会主席陈少敏亲自奖给学习成绩优良者每人一个围裙，上面有“奖郝建秀工作者”的字样。全体学员一致表示：回厂后一定要坚决完成推广郝建秀工作法的光荣任务。
