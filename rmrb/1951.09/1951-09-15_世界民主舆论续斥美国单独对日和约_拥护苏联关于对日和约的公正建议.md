Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Democratic public opinion in various countries around the world supports the Soviet Union's proposals regarding a peace treaty with Japan and vehemently condemns the separate peace treaty with Japan illegally signed in San Francisco. The Korean *Rodong Sinmun* published an editorial entitled "The U.S.-British Peace Treaty with Japan is a War Treaty," stating: As expected, the U.S. imperialists used their voting machine at the San Francisco conference to force through their draft peace treaty with Japan, violating the will of Asian countries. The purpose of this treaty is to prepare for a war of aggression in the Far East. The newspaper pointed out that the U.S. imperialists tried to limit the conference to a perfunctory procedure for signing the treaty and to prevent discussion of the treaty. Their aim was to conceal the treaty's aggressive nature from the people of the world and to prevent the broad masses of peace-loving people from knowing the statement made by the Soviet delegation to steadfastly defend lasting world peace—including peace in the Far East. The newspaper continued: The Korean people are willing to conclude a treaty with Japan, just as the Soviet delegation emphasized at the San Francisco conference, based on the principles reflected in international agreements such as Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam. The people of the world, including the Japanese people, support the Soviet Union's proposals regarding a peace treaty with Japan, because these proposals are aimed at establishing true peace in Asia.
    The Czechoslovak Peace Defenders Committee issued a statement on the 12th opposing the so-called peace treaty with Japan signed in San Francisco. The statement said: "The initiators and signatories of this so-called treaty trampled on the inalienable right of the people of Asian countries to decide their own destiny, especially the inalienable right of the Chinese people, who played the most important role in the war against Japanese aggression. The fact that India and Burma did not attend the signing clearly shows the illegal nature and invalidity of this so-called treaty." The committee also sent a telegram to the Japanese Peace Committee, expressing support for the Japanese people and protesting against the U.S. attempt to turn Japan into a U.S. colony and military base.
    A commentary in the Hungarian *Szabad Nép* said: In this U.S.-British-made treaty, the people of various countries can see that the United States is continuing to implement the policy it has consistently pursued in Japan since the end of the war. This policy is a policy of preparing for aggression against the Soviet Union and the Asian people. Referring to the statement made by the Soviet delegation in San Francisco, the newspaper said: The Soviet delegation went to San Francisco on behalf of hundreds of millions of people to protest this war treaty. The just proposals put forward by the Soviet Union expressed the interests of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people and immediately won the support of the people of various countries, especially the people of Asia.
    The Albanian newspaper *Zëri i Popullit* emphasized in an editorial: The shameful end of the San Francisco conference has aroused great indignation among the people of the world. It is clear to people that the so-called U.S.-British peace treaty with Japan is not a peace treaty, but a means of preparing for war in the Far East. The newspaper continued: The people of the world, including the Albanian people, hope to realize the Soviet Union's proposals.
    The East German *Nacht-Express* commented on the U.S.'s manipulation of the San Francisco conference to sign a separate treaty, saying: "Only those stupid Americans would believe that a treaty can be concluded merely by the signatures of those who agree to everything without saying a word, and by ignoring the countries concerned." The commentary emphasized: "The United States and its satellite countries must bear the consequences of their actions."
    An editorial in the Danish newspaper *Land og Folk* on the 10th said: The peace treaty with Japan manufactured single-handedly by the United States "has nothing to do with peace, and the way it was signed has nothing to do with democracy. This is a 'peace' that is not even worth the paper it is written on. This treaty is illegal and invalid, and it will prompt the people of the whole of Asia to resist the United States more resolutely—the United States has made it clear in San Francisco that it has no regard for the interests of the people of various countries."
    The Canadian *Canadian Forum* published a special article on the 10th, stating: Japan will become a large base for U.S. aggression in the East, just as West Germany will become a base for U.S. aggression in the West. But the U.S.'s ambition to dominate the world has even less hope of success than Hitler's unfortunate ambition. The article asked: Why is this plan bound to fail? "Because it does not take into account the real politics of today. Today there is a new Asia, which has broken, or is breaking, the chains of long-term imperialist enslavement. The hundreds of millions of people of Asia have risen to fight for freedom, and nothing can stop them. Today, the people of the world have realized that it is the Soviet Union, which has consistently fought for the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world, that supports peace, democracy, and socialism. The people are moving forward. They will never allow Japan and Germany to become the shock troops of imperialist aggression against all mankind again."

    世界民主舆论续斥美国单独对日和约
    拥护苏联关于对日和约的公正建议
    【新华社十四日讯】世界各国的民主舆论拥护苏联关于对日和约的建议，痛斥在旧金山非法签订的单独对日和约。朝鲜的《劳动新闻》以《美英对日和约是一个战争条约》为题发表社论说：如所预料的，美帝国主义者在旧金山会议上开动他们的表决机器，违反亚洲国家的意志，强制通过了他们的对日和约草案。这个和约的目的是要在远东准备侵略战争的。该报指出：美帝国主义者设法把会议限制为签署和约的官样程序，并阻止讨论和约，其目的就是要想把这个条约的侵略性对全世界的人民隐瞒起来，不让广大的爱好和平的人民群众知道苏联代表团为坚定不移地保卫世界持久和平——包括远东和平——而发表的声明。该报继续说：朝鲜人民愿意与日本缔结那样一个和约，就如苏联代表团在旧金山会议上所强调的，这个和约要以开罗、雅尔塔和波茨坦等国际协议所反映的原则为基础。全世界的人民，包括日本人民，都拥护苏联关于对日和约的建议，因为这些建议是为了确立亚洲的真正和平的。
    捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会在十二日发表声明，反对在旧金山签字的所谓对日和约。声明说：“这一所谓和约的发起者与签字者，践踏了亚洲各国人民决定他们自己命运的不可让与的权利，特别是在反对日本侵略的战争中起了最重要作用的中国人民的不可让与的权利。印度与缅甸都未出席签字，这清楚地表明了这个所谓条约的非法性质和没有效力。”该委员会并致电日本拥护和平委员会，表示声援日本人民，抗议美国想把日本变为美国殖民地与军事基地的企图。
    匈牙利《自由人民报》的评论说：在这个美英制造的和约里，各国人民可以看出，美国仍继续执行它自战争结束以来在日本所一贯执行的政策。这个政策是准备对苏联及亚洲人民进行侵略的政策。该报在论及苏联代表团在旧金山发表的声明时说：苏联代表团是代表亿万人民前往旧金山去抗议这个战争条约的。苏联所提出的公正建议，表达了千百万爱好和平人民的利益，立刻获得了各国人民，特别是亚洲人民的拥护。
    阿尔巴尼亚报纸《人民之声报》在社论中强调指出：旧金山会议的可耻的结束，引起了全世界人民的极大愤慨。人们明显地看出，美英的所谓对日和约不是和平条约，而是一种准备远东战争的手段。该报继续说：全世界人民，包括阿尔巴尼亚人民在内，都希望实现苏联的建议。
    民主德国的《每夜快报》十日评论美国操纵旧金山会议签订单独和约说：“只有那帮愚蠢的美国人才会相信：仅仅由那些不发一言而赞同一切的人签字，并撇开有关的国家不管，便能够缔结一项和约。”评论强调说：“美国及其卫星国家必须担当他们的行动的后果。”
    丹麦“国土与人民”报十日的社论说：美国一手制造的对日和约“与和平毫不相干，签订这个和约的方式与民主政治毫不相干。这是一种价值还抵不上写和约条文的纸张的“和平”。这个和约是非法的，无效的，它将促使全亚洲人民更坚决地抵抗美国——美国已在旧金山清楚地表明它毫不顾及各国人民的利益。”
    加拿大的《加拿大论坛报》于十日发表专文说：日本将成为美国侵略东方的大基地，正如西德将成为美国侵略西方的基地一样。但是美国的统治世界的野心计划甚至比希特勒的倒霉的野心计划更少成功的希望。该文问道：为什么这个计划一定会失败呢？“因为它没有考虑今天的现实政治。今天有一个新亚洲，这个亚洲已经打断、或者正在打断长期的帝国主义奴役的锁链。亚洲的千百万人民已奋起争取自由，任何东西都阻挡不了他们。今天，全世界人民已认识到，一贯为争取全世界各国和平共存而战斗的是拥护和平、民主与社会主义的苏联。人民在向前迈进。他们决不会让日本和德国再成为帝国主义侵略全人类的冲锋队。”
