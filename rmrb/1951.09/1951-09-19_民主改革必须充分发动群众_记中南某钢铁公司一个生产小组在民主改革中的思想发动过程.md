Democratic Reform Must Fully Mobilize the Masses
    —A Record of the Ideological Mobilization Process of a Production Team in a Steel Company in South Central China During Democratic Reform
    Chen Tao
    The Feudal Reactionary Elements Controlled the Team
    The steel casting team of a steelmaking plant in a steel company in South Central China was a backward team controlled by feudal remnants in the past. The team leader, Ge Shutong, was a feudal foreman; the technician, Chen Zesheng, was a scab before liberation who consistently sold out the interests of the working class and sabotaged strike movements several times. After liberation, he even sneaked into the trade union and became the chairman. The team had only a dozen people, several of whom were technicians controlled by Ge Shutong. Before the democratic reform, the team was filled with a miasma of feudal reactionary elements, and progressive forces dared not raise their heads.
    Communist Party member Peng Huafei actively engaged in production but was attacked by Chen Zesheng and Ge Shutong. Peng Huafei suggested using natural sand instead of artificial sand to improve quality and reduce costs, but Chen Zesheng and Ge Shutong said that Peng Huafei's rationalization proposal was not following "technical guidance" and that he was a "personal hero." Peng Huafei tried to overcome difficulties and completed the task of producing eight hundred coal car wheels. Ge Shutong and others deliberately reported his good products as defective products, falsely accusing him of making more than one hundred bad ones, which made him vomit blood in anger.
    During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, two special agents in the company were arrested. Peng Huafei thought to himself, "I knew these guys would have this day sooner or later!" When the factory began to carry out democratic reform, he actively reported and accused the bad elements. Li Changfu, who had always been afraid of offending people, initially had concerns about reporting and accusing feudal reactionary elements. Seeing Peng Huafei often being attacked, he once advised Peng Huafei, "They have great power, how can we fight them? Your suggestions are correct, but they still treat you like an enemy. Why offend them? Just work and eat." This time, during the democratic reform, the higher authorities made it clear that they would support the workers and fight against these feudal foremen and gang leaders. The government's policy was exactly what Li Changfu wanted, and he said, "We have people to support us now, we must resolutely fight against these bad guys, otherwise, we will never have a share in being the masters of our own house."
    Workers Oppressed by Feudal Forces
    All Demand to Participate in Democratic Struggle
    At the beginning of the democratic reform, Peng Huafei, Li Changfu, and others actively struggled against Chen Zesheng and Ge Shutong. However, due to the long-term rule of feudal remnants, most people in the team still had concerns and dared not speak out. Only a few activists spoke at the meetings. After in-depth ideological mobilization, the class consciousness of the masses was enlightened through speaking bitterness, and the democratic reform movement gradually unfolded. Li Changsheng was a new worker in the team. When he first started to fight against Chen Zesheng and Ge Shutong, he felt, "I haven't been in the factory for long, I don't know who is good and who is bad. Chen Zesheng and Ge Shutong only attacked Peng Huafei, not me. What does it have to do with me? I don't care about these things." He did not participate in the struggle and just muddled through the meeting time every day. However, as soon as speaking bitterness began, Li Changsheng's heart was moved. When some workers accused the puppet village head of seizing men for the army, it reminded him of his own past suffering. On the fifth day of the first lunar month in 1947, before the Spring Festival was over, the puppet village head brought a gun to his door in the middle of the night and forced him to become a soldier. At that time, the government, courts, army, and police were all in cahoots with the village head. He was a poor worker, where could he run? Thinking of these things, he realized, "Democratic reform is to defeat the feudal reactionary forces, it is to eradicate the root of suffering, how can I not care? Although Chen Zesheng has not oppressed me, he has oppressed other workers. Although I have not been oppressed by Chen Zesheng, I have been oppressed by other feudal foremen. And, as time goes by, Chen Zesheng and others will certainly oppress me in the same way." He figured it out, and after work, he helped others to break through their thoughts and mobilized them to fight against the feudal reactionary elements. He said, "What are you still afraid of? Now we have the leadership of the Communist Party and the support of the People's Government. Who dares to oppress us again?"
    Master Deng Realized His Master's Status
    in the Struggle
    Most of the workers became aware, but some of the older workers with technical skills still stood outside the movement. They were all the backbone of production and had prestige among the masses. Therefore, it was necessary to enlighten their awareness and attract them to the movement.
    Deng Zitang, an old worker in the team who was over fifty years old, had been working since he was fifteen years old. His skills were very good, and he had the highest salary in the team. In the old society, because he could not endure the oppression, he could not work in that factory for more than a few months before he quarreled and left. After liberation, Master Deng also felt that the Communist Party was good, but if anyone said that the working class had become the masters of their own house, he could not understand it. He thought: it was still "working for money to eat." When the trade union was organized, he thought, "I don't want to be the team leader, and I don't want to be the chairman." He had no interest in electing trade union committee members at all. At the beginning of the democratic reform, he did not like the democratic struggle. However, as the democratic struggle deepened step by step, the criminal acts of the feudal foremen in sabotaging the factory were revealed one by one. For example, in June 1949, the feudal foreman Ge Shutong sabotaged the boiler, causing all the molten steel to leak out and attacking the activists in production. Last July, the feudal reactionary elements sabotaged the production competition. The iron-smelting furnace in the steelmaking plant exploded due to the sabotage of the feudal reactionary elements. From January to March this year, a total of fifty-two accidents occurred in the steelmaking plant.
    These facts flashed before Master Deng's eyes one by one, and he began to doubt his past attitude: "These bad elements are really hateful. They have destroyed the factory. How can that be?" He thought, "If everyone is like me: only cares about working for money to eat, and doesn't care about everyone's affairs; won't the special agents and feudal foremen never be defeated, then can't they destroy whatever they want?" Activists went to help Master Deng, enlightening him to recognize the root of his past suffering and the position of the working class today. Master Deng recalled that when he was working in the past, he often suffered from the boss's anger. Because he could not bear these angers, he always quit his job. He really did not know how much suffering he had endured. Sometimes when he was unemployed, he could not even eat, and his family members were still begging for food in the countryside. After liberation, he had been working in this factory for two years, and had not "lost his job." This was really something that had never happened in his history. Now, the whole family does not worry about eating or drinking, and his son has also married a wife. In the past, he wanted to find a matchmaker for his son, but when others found out that he had no house and no land and was a worker, they refused. Now, when a matchmaker is mentioned, everyone shakes their heads when they hear about landlords, and everyone is willing when they hear about workers. He thought, "The position of the working class has really improved. I am really unaware of my good fortune."
    "To be the masters of our own house, we must manage the factory well and not let the enemy destroy it again!" Master Deng figured it out, and he became an activist in the democratic reform movement.
    Workers with Ideological Concerns Transformed
    During the movement, some workers who had participated in the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the "Guerrilla Force," and had some dealings with the enemy still had concerns.
    There was a Ye Fengyan in the team who had participated in the Kuomintang's "Guerrilla Force" in the past. When the suppression of counter-revolutionaries began, he had an ideological burden. Although the working cadres often explained the policy to him, saying "the ringleaders must be punished, those who were coerced will not be questioned," he still doubted, "How does the government know what to do?"
    Ye Fengyan carried this heavy burden. At the meeting, no matter how fiercely others spoke, he did not speak. The team leader urged him to speak, but he did not say a word. Later, in order to explain the policy to the masses, the higher authorities adopted the method of dealing with specific cases to break through the ideological concerns of the masses. On July 22, a public trial was held in a certain city. The government accepted the demands of the masses, executed Liu Jinkui, a Kuomintang secret agent and Green Gang leader who had committed heinous crimes, and Wang Daoping, a traitor and local tyrant, and released Zeng Zhaode, who had been arrested on suspicion but was found innocent after investigation. At this moment, Ye Fengyan's heart became clear: "The government will not wrongly accuse good people casually. Those who are innocent are still released. This is really our own government." After the meeting, he went home excitedly and said to his wife:
    "I have security now, my heart is at ease." At the team meeting the next day, Ye Fengyan, who had not spoken for two months, opened his mouth and reported Zhang Zhirui, a landlord and village chief hiding in the factory.
    No Longer Be Exploited by Feudal Reactionary Elements
    The materials that the general masses understood have all been put forward. To further expose the crimes of the feudal reactionary elements and thoroughly defeat the feudal reactionary forces, it is necessary to win over some of the coerced elements under the influence of the feudal reactionary forces, so that they can break away from the feudal reactionary elements and stand on the side of the masses.
    "Thoroughly transform the henchmen of the feudal foremen!" At the team meeting, the workers in the team turned their attention to Wu Youchen. Who didn't know that Wu Youchen was Chen Zesheng and Ge Shutong's underling? They instructed him to do everything. Peng Huafei considered: Wu Youchen was also a worker who had suffered from childhood and worked hard for many years. He was also oppressed in the old society. His skills were not bad, and he was active and responsible in production. Although he had helped Chen Zesheng attack him in the past, it was only because he was not aware enough and was exploited by them. Therefore, Peng Huafei and everyone discussed: We should still strive to unite with Wu Youchen. Peng also said to Wu Youchen: "You are also a member of the working class. You did wrong things in the past because you were exploited by them. As long as you thoroughly repent and thoroughly defeat them with everyone, everyone will not fight against you!" Wu Youchen had worked outside in the past, and he was alone and helpless. He always wanted to find a backer to ensure that he would not lose his job. Because of this, he had joined the reactionary party and organization. Ge Shutong introduced him to the factory, and his brother was introduced to the factory by Chen Zesheng, so he always thought that Chen Zesheng treated him well. At the same time, he believed that Chen Zesheng had great power and that relying on Chen Zesheng would be beneficial to him, so he would do whatever Chen Zesheng and others asked him to do. In fact, he later realized himself: "Although I relied on them at that time, I was still worried all day long about offending them. Everything I did at that time was for the sake of my job!" During the democratic reform movement, he realized his past mistakes. Therefore, he was determined to put down his burden, admit his mistakes to the masses, and tell all the facts about how the counter-revolutionary elements had wooed him in the past to attack the activists and sabotage the factory, and he even went on stage to accuse and testify in person. After such education, the ideological awareness of the workers in the team was greatly improved, and they actively participated in the struggle for democratic reform in the factory.

    民主改革必须充分发动群众
    ——记中南某钢铁公司一个生产小组在民主改革中的思想发动过程
    陈涛
    封建反动分子控制了小组
    中南某钢铁公司炼钢厂铸钢组，过去是一个被封建残余势力所控制的落后小组。组长葛树桐是封建把头；技工陈泽生在解放前是一个一贯出卖工人阶级利益、几次破坏罢工运动的工贼，解放后又混进工会当了主席。全组只有十几个人，其中有几个技工都被葛树桐所左右。在民主改革以前，该组被这些封建反动分子闹得乌烟瘴气，进步力量不敢抬头。
    共产党员彭华飞积极生产，受到陈泽生、葛树桐的打击。彭华飞建议用天然砂代替人工砂，以提高质量降低成本，陈泽生和葛树桐却说彭华飞这个合理化建议是不服从“技术指导”，说他是“个人英雄主义”。彭华飞想办法克服困难，完成了八百个煤车轮的任务。葛树桐等竟故意把他作的良品报成废品，诬赖他做坏了一百多个，气得他吐了血。
    在镇压反革命运动中，该公司两个特务分子被逮捕。彭华飞心里想：“我早知道这些家伙终究会有这一天！”在该厂开始进行民主改革时，他积极地检举和控诉坏分子。向来不敢得罪人的李长富，起先对于检举和控诉封建反动分子是有顾虑的。他看见彭华飞常受打击，曾劝彭华飞说：“人家势力大，我们怎么斗得过人家？你提的意见正确，他们还把你当仇人。何必得罪他们呢？做工吃饭算了。”这次进行民主改革时，上级明确表示为工人撑腰，斗争这些封建把头、帮会头子。政府的政策正对了李长富的心思，他说：“我们有人撑腰了，一定要坚决斗争这些坏家伙，不然，当家作主总是没有我们的份。”
    受封建势力压迫的工人
    都要求参加民主斗争
    在民主改革开始时、彭华飞、李长富等积极地对陈泽生、葛树桐进行斗争。但是，由于封建残余势力长期统治，组内大多数人还有顾虑，不敢说话，开会只有少数积极分子发言。经过深入思想发动，通过诉苦启发了群众的阶级觉悟，民主改革运动逐步展开。李长生是该组的一个新工友，开始斗争陈泽生和葛树桐时，他觉得：“我刚进厂不久，谁好谁坏我也不知道。陈泽生、葛树桐他们只打击过彭华飞，没有打击过我，与我有什么关系？我才不管这些闲事。”他不参加斗争，每天混过开会时间就算了。但是，诉苦一开始，李长生的心就动了。当有些工友控诉伪乡长抓壮丁的罪恶时，更使他联想起自己过去的苦处。一九四七年正月初五，春节还没有过完，伪乡长半夜带枪上门，逼他当壮丁。那时的政府、法院、军队、警察，都是和乡长一气的。他是一个穷工人，能往那里跑呢？想起这些事情，他觉悟了：“民主改革就是要打垮封建反动势力，是拔苦根，我怎么能够不管？陈泽生虽然没压迫过我，可是压迫过别的工人。我虽然没受过陈泽生的压迫，可是受过别的封建把头的压迫。并且，以后年长月久，陈泽生他们一定也会同样的压迫到我头上来。”他想通了，下了班，就帮助别人打通思想，动员他们斗争封建反动分子，他说：“还怕什么？现在有共产党领导，有人民政府撑腰，谁还敢再欺压我们？”
    邓师傅在斗争中认识了
    自己的主人翁的地位
    多数工人觉悟起来了，但是，一部分有技术的老工人还是站在运动之外。他们都是生产上的骨干，在群众中有威信。因此，必须启发他们的觉悟，把他们吸引到运动中来。
    该组五十多岁的老工人邓子堂，从十五岁当学徒到现在，一直都是靠做工吃饭。他的手艺很好，在组里工资最高。在旧社会里因为忍受不了压迫，在那个厂里，也做不到几个月工，就吵翻了走路。解放后，邓师傅也觉得共产党好，但谁要是说工人阶级当了主人翁，他就想不通。他想：还不是“做工拿钱吃饭”。组织工会时，他想：“我既不想当组长，也不想当主席。”对于选举工会委员，他根本没有兴趣。在开始民主改革时，他对于民主斗争看不惯。但是民主斗争一步步的深入，封建把头破坏工厂的罪恶行为一件件地被揭露出来了。例如一九四九年六月间，封建把头葛树桐破坏锅炉，漏掉全部钢水，打击生产积极分子。去年七月，封建反动分子破坏生产竞赛。炼钢厂化铁炉因封建反动分子的破坏而爆炸。今年一月至三月炼钢厂一共发生事故五十二件。
    这些事实一幕幕的在邓师傅的眼前闪过，他开始对自己过去的态度怀疑起来：“这些坏分子真可恨，把工厂破坏了，那怎么行呢？”他想：“如果人人都像我这样：只顾做工吃饭，不管大家的事；特务、封建把头不是永远打不倒，那么他们不是想破坏什么就破坏什么吗？”积极分子都去帮助邓师傅，启发他认识过去受苦的根源和今天工人阶级的地位。邓师傅回想过去做工时，常常受老板的气。自己因为受不了这些气，总是丢工作，真不知吃了多少苦头。有时失业了，连饭都吃不上，家里人还在乡下要过饭。解放后，一直在这个厂里干了两年，没有“丢工作”，这真是他历史上从来没有过的事情。现在，全家不愁吃不愁喝，儿子也娶了媳妇。过去他也早想给儿子说亲，但别人打听出他没有房子没有地，是个做工的，就不答应了。现在说亲，一提到地主，大家都摇头，一提到工人，大家都愿意。他想：“工人阶级的地位真是提高了，我真是人在福中不知福”。
    “当主人翁就要把工厂管好，不能再让敌人来破坏！”邓师傅想通了，他成了民主改革运动中的积极分子。
    有思想顾虑的工人转变了
    在运动进行中，有一部分过去参加过国民党、三青团、“游击队”和与敌人有过些往来的工人，还有顾虑。
    该组有个叶丰炎，过去参加过国民党的“游击队”。镇压反革命运动开始时，他思想上就背了包袱。虽然工作干部也常常对他讲解政策，说“首恶必办，胁从不问”，但他还是怀疑：“晓得政府怎么办呀”？
    叶丰炎背上了这个大包袱，开会时，随便别人说得怎样激烈，他也不开口。组长催他发言，他也不作声。后来，上级为了向群众交代政策，采取了通过处理具体案件的办法来打破群众的思想顾虑。七月二十二日某市召开了公审大会，政府接受群众要求，枪毙了罪大恶极的军统特务、青帮头子刘金魁和汉奸恶霸王道平，又释放了因嫌疑被捕经查明无罪的曾照德。这一下叶丰炎心里可亮了：“政府不会随便冤枉好人，没有罪的还是释放，这真是我们自己的政府。”散会回家，他就兴冲冲地对老婆说：
    “我有了保障了，我的心放下来了。”第二天的小组会上，两个月没有说话的叶丰炎开口了，他检举了藏在厂里的地主保长张之瑞。
    不再受封建反动分子利用了
    一般群众所了解的材料都提出来了。要更进一步地揭发封建反动分子的罪恶，澈底打垮封建反动势力，必须争取某些在封建反动势力影响下的胁从分子，使他们与封建反动分子割断联系，站到群众方面来。
    “要封建把头的爪牙澈底转过来”！在小组会上，该组工友的话头对准了吴佑臣，谁不知道吴佑臣是陈泽生、葛树桐的手下人呢？什么事情他们都是指使他出来干的。彭华飞考虑到：吴佑臣也是从小受苦长年劳动的工人，在旧社会也是受压迫的，他技术还不错，生产也积极负责。虽然在过去他帮助陈泽生打击过自己，那也只怪他觉悟不高，受了他们的利用。于是，彭华飞和大家商量：对吴佑臣还是应该争取团结。彭又对吴佑臣说：“你也是工人阶级的一分子。过去做错了事，那是受了他们的利用。只要你澈底悔悟，和大家一起来澈底斗倒他们，大家是不会斗争你的！”吴佑臣过去在外面做工，无依无靠，总想找个靠山，保证自己不失业，因为这，他曾经参加过反动党团。他是葛树桐介绍进厂的，他哥哥又是陈泽生介绍进厂的，所以他总认为陈泽生待他不错。同时，他认为陈泽生势力大，依靠陈泽生对自己有好处，所以陈泽生等叫他干什么就干什么。其实呢，他后来自己也认识到了：“那时虽然是依靠他们，还不是整天提心吊胆地怕得罪他们，那时干什么都是为了饭碗啊！”在民主改革运动中，他才认识到过去的错误。因此，他决心放下包袱，向群众承认错误，把反革命分子过去怎样拉拢他打击积极分子破坏工厂的事实全部说出来，还上台当面控诉作证。全组工人经过这样的教育，思想觉悟大大提高，积极参加了该厂民主改革的斗争。
