Xinhua News Agency, September 24th, TASS, September 23rd: According to reports from Tokyo, the progressive people of Japan have launched a widespread protest movement to oppose the Japanese Diet's approval of the separate peace treaty and the so-called "security treaty" US-Japan military agreement.

"Zenro News" stated on September 20th that the Japan Peace Supporters Committee called on the people to launch a protest movement against the impending ratification of the separate peace treaty and the "security treaty," to actively collect signatures for the World Peace Council's declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, to demand the establishment of a comprehensive peace treaty, and to oppose the rearmament of Japan.

The organ of the All-Japan Chemical Industry Workers' Union ("Daikagaku"), "Daikagaku Front," stated in its September 19th editorial: "Although the shameful Treaty of Japan has been signed, we must do everything in our power to prevent its ratification. Japanese trade unions must force the members of the Japanese Diet to promise to oppose the ratification of the treaty. We must launch a broad protest movement to oppose the ratification of the treaty."

Various groups and unions under the influence of right-wing labor leaders also support the movement to protest ratification. "Zenro News" stated that at the Japan National Postal Workers' Convention held from September 10th to 12th, the majority passed resolutions opposing the so-called "US-Japan economic cooperation," opposing the stationing of US troops in Japan, opposing the rearmament of Japan, and advocating the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty.

The "Shin Sanbetsu" newspaper stated in its September 20th editorial: "Ignoring the opposition of the overwhelming majority of workers, pastors, and intellectuals, Yoshida has actually signed the reactionary peace treaty and security treaty. The tragic fate of Japan as a conquered nation has begun. Although the peace treaty and security treaty have been signed, we cannot endorse them."

Japanese newspapers state that the Japanese Diet is scheduled to hold a special session on October 10th to ratify the separate peace treaty and the "security treaty." The Yoshida government apparently intends to quickly pass the "treaty" and "security treaty" in the Diet.

    日本进步人民发动广泛抗议运动
    反对国会批准单独和约及美日军事协定
    积极征集要求缔结五大国和平公约签名
   【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社二十三日讯：据东京消息，日本的进步人民已发动广泛的抗议运动，以反对日本国会批准单独和约以及所谓“安全条约”的美日军事协定。
   “全递新闻”九月二十日说，日本拥护和平委员会号召人民发动抗议运动，反对即将对于单独和约与“安全条约”的批准，积极征集世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言的签名，要求订立全面和约，以及反对重新武装日本。
   全日本化学产业工会（简称“大化学”）机关报“大化学战线”九月十九日的社论说：“虽然可耻的对日和约已经签字，我们必须竭尽一切能力以阻止该约的批准。日本工会必须迫使日本国会的议员答应反对批准和约。我们要发动广泛的抗议运动以反对批准和约。”
   在右翼工会领袖影响之下的各团体与工会，也支持抗议批准的运动。“全递新闻”说，在九月十日到十二日举行的日本全国邮政从业员大会上，大多数通过决议反对所谓“美日经济合作”，反对美军驻扎日本，反对重新武装日本，主张签订全面和约。
   “新产别”报九月二十日社论说：“不顾占压倒多数的劳动者、牧师和知识分子的反对，吉田竟然签订了反动的和约与安全条约。作为一个被征服国家的日本的悲剧命运已经开始。虽然和约与安全条约已经签订，我们却不能赞成。”
   日本报纸说，日本国会定于十月十日举行特别会议，批准单独和约与“安全条约”。吉田政府显然是想赶快在国会里通过“和约”与“安全条约”。
