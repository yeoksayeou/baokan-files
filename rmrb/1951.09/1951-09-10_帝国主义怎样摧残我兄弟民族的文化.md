    How Imperialism Corrodes the Culture of Our Brotherly Nationalities
    Ma Xueliang, Associate Professor, Department of Oriental Languages, Peking University

    In 1942, when I was investigating the Yi language in a Yi area in Yunnan, I was surprised to find that there was a church or hospital of varying sizes in every area I visited. The persons in charge of these churches and hospitals were mostly missionaries from countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. They were very close to the brotherly nationalities and often went to preach and talk about their beliefs. I lived in the home of a non-Christian Yi person, and sometimes these foreign missionaries would come and chat with me, asking all sorts of questions. I didn't hide from them that I was there to study Yi culture. But after this news spread, I was almost under surveillance. People came to see my work every day, and the grinning faces made me hate them even more now when I think about them. Later, I learned the Yi language from a Yi scripture teacher, and several Yi youths also studied with me. They became even more alarmed. Once, a Chinese Christian from the church came to persuade me, saying that he was ordered by foreigners to take me to live in the church and enticed me by saying that they had cleaned a quiet house for me, with milk and bread to eat. I politely declined. Soon, a so-called "chairman," a Chinese person, came with a somewhat tough attitude and argued with me all afternoon. Finally, he took out a phonetic script created by foreigners for the locals and forced me to give up learning the Yi language and have that group of young people learn their phonetic script. Not long after, that chairman came again. He saw that we were still learning the Yi language, and he was a little uneasy. I told him that we had already learned the phonetic script and had to continue learning the Yi language. He took out a Bible written in the phonetic script to test us. He saw that we could all read it correctly, and he had nothing to say and left dejectedly. Seeing that their ambition could not be achieved, they soon spread rumors that bandits would rob and kill us, and warned that there was no guarantee of life if we stayed here for a long time. The Yi people who were working with me were all afraid and scattered. I had to run back to Kunming alone in disappointment. At that time, I was still confused. I was learning my Yi language, what did it have to do with them? I didn't know their intentions in repeatedly hindering me. But I gave up halfway, and I was really unwilling. Fortunately, I accidentally ran into a Yi chieftain in Kunming. I told him about my experience and aspirations. He sympathized with me very much and immediately agreed to let me go to his chieftain's office to study the Yi scriptures he had collected. He also told me that there was an old wizard in his chieftain's office who had retired and returned home, who was very knowledgeable and had the most scriptures. He agreed to introduce me and was responsible for protecting me. So I followed this chieftain back to a chieftain's office on the Jinsha River and resumed my old lessons. I was glad that I had turned misfortune into blessing. After a few months, I went to visit the old wizard with the most books that the chieftain had introduced to me. This old wizard was already seventy or eighty years old. When I arrived at his home, I talked with him for a while, explaining my intentions. He seemed very fearful and refused my request. When talking about scriptures, he was even more secretive and unwilling to speak directly. I was a little suspicious. I lived in his home for a period of time and visited the locals everywhere. They all said in unison that he had indeed had many books before, but later they didn't know where he had moved them to, and even his son didn't know. I was very disappointed, but I still treated the old man with the respect of a disciple, respectfully asking him to teach me orally and record what he said. After a period of time, the old man saw that I was sincere in my studies and was moved. One night, he and I sat around the fireplace warming ourselves. I saw him with tears in his eyes, pondering as if he had unspeakable secrets. I gently comforted him, but he just sighed and didn't say anything. Later, he asked me instead: "Our Yi people don't learn their own writing anymore, what are you Han people learning it for?" I told him that in order to preserve the Yi culture, the Yi language cannot be abandoned. He sighed again after hearing my words, sadly for a long time. I saw in the flickering firelight that his dry face was filled with infinite pain. I poured him a bowl of tea and handed it to him. He took a sip of tea and told me the following lament:

    "Although I am a Yi wizard, I always feel that the Yi scriptures are the crystallization of our ancestors' hard work. They are the continuers of Yi culture, so I don't just treat them as a tool of my profession like ordinary wizards. Therefore, I often study them and collect a large number of them. Later, the chieftain's office summoned me to be the chieftain's wizard because I was more knowledgeable. Because there were more books in the chieftain's office, I read some scriptures there that I had never read before, and I felt even more that the Yi scriptures had value for research. Later, the old chieftain died and sent those scriptures to me. I kept them and burned incense day and night to study them respectfully. One year, several foreign missionaries came to the church. They claimed to study the Yi scriptures, so they bought them at high prices. At that time, the Yi people believed it to be true, and some profiteers sold them in large quantities. At first, I didn't know their tricks. In order to live, I also wanted to sell some, but later I thought that the Yi scriptures were heavenly books and had gods in them (Note: This is based on a myth that in ancient times, when the sky was dark, the heavenly palace sent a divine wizard riding a yellow ox carrying heavenly books to save the people.). We can't sell them no matter how poor we are, but the foreigners heard that I had a lot of books and threatened and lured me to buy them several times, but I refused. Later, a message came from the church that the foreigners had secretly burned all the books they had bought. I was a little sad and panicked when I heard it. I hurried back and secretly sent all the scriptures to hide in the cave in the dead of night and sealed it up. I felt a little relieved in my heart. Since then, the young people no longer read the Yi scriptures left by their ancestors. Everyone goes to church to learn foreign languages ​​and read the Bible. Even my son no longer inherits my mantle and goes to learn foreign languages ​​as well. I have a lot of sorrow in my heart, and no one will complain to me. I see that our Yi culture is about to be interrupted. This time I saw you, at first I thought that the Han people were also imitating the tricks of foreigners and wanted to come again to eradicate us. These days I see that you are indeed sincere in learning our writing, and you are willing to think about our culture, so I told you what has been rotten in my heart for more than ten years, hoping that you will not tell outsiders." After the old man finished speaking, he sighed several times in a row, and I also sighed a few times with him. At night, I slept in bed, recalling the various obstacles that foreign missionaries threatened and lured us with when I and several Yi youths were studying the Yi language together. At this time, I suddenly realized it. Since then, I have been persuading the old wizard to take me to see the cave and take the scriptures back, but he always said that the will of God cannot be violated, especially afraid that foreigners would know about it and burn the books again. At that time, he would be guilty of heaven and even more terrible. Seeing that he was stubborn and unwilling, I didn't want to force him, and soon I returned to the chieftain's office again. I visited the local elders, and they all knew the story of foreign missionaries burning books, but they didn't know why they burned the scriptures passed down by their ancestors; instead, they praised the foreigners for their small favors to them. I saw that there were still some remaining Yi scriptures circulating in the chieftain's office and among the people. If I didn't find a way to preserve them, they would inevitably suffer another disaster. Therefore, I urgently sent a letter to the cultural people in Chongqing at that time, asking them to find a way to collect them. Soon, Mr. Wan Sinian from the Peking Library came to negotiate with me. After many twists and turns, he collected more than a thousand copies. At that time, they were transported back and divided among the Peking Library, Tsinghua, Peking University, Nankai and other libraries, with the Peking Library having the most collections.

    As mentioned above, although what the old wizard talked about inevitably had some mythological colors, it is a fact that imperialism burned books in order to destroy the Yi culture, forcing the old wizard to hide the scriptures in the cave. Not only that, after they destroyed the Yi culture, they created a set of phonetic symbols with English letters mixed with many lines for the locals to learn, as a medium to numb their minds and spread poison. This symbol is the symbol that the chairman wanted me to learn, which is widely circulated in the brotherly ethnic areas of the Southwest. Foreign missionaries were also afraid that the locals would not be willing to learn, so they systematically fabricated a set of myths based on the situation of each ethnic group. For example, in the Miao area, there is the following legend: "Five thousand years ago, after the Miao ancestor Chiyou was defeated by the Yellow Emperor, he led his clan to move south. At that time, the clan's inherent books were inconvenient to take away, and they were afraid that the clan would forget the writing after the migration, so he ordered the women of the clan to embroider the writing on the corners of their clothes and skirts, so the Miao writing was preserved. Today's Miao writing is the result of organizing the patterns on the clothes and skirts of Miao women." Anyone who sees this set of symbols knows that it is quite similar to the patterns embroidered on the clothes of Miao women. How many brotherly nationalities have been deceived by this kind of cover-up. Some people talked to me and even said that they were not Chinese. When asked why, they immediately recited a set of Genesis to me, because they and foreign missionaries were descendants of Adam and Eve, so they were people of the same race. It can be seen that the danger of this poison is too great.

    In order for the locals to smoothly accept their numbing poison, imperialism unscrupulously imitated Qin Shihuang's brutal means of burning books. Is there a greater crime in the world than destroying a country and destroying its culture? We must remember this heinous crime, especially the brotherly nationalities should be vigilant. In the past, the brotherly nationalities suffered the double oppression of imperialism and Han chauvinism and lived a hard life. They dared not read the books left by their ancestors or speak their own language. Now is the time for our people to be the masters. Not only do we have the freedom to study our own language, but the ethnic policy of the Common Program also clearly stipulates that "all minority nationalities have the freedom to develop their languages and writing, maintain or reform their customs and religious beliefs." Therefore, we should cherish the cultural heritage left by our ancestors even more, study it well, promote it, and accept it critically, so as to be worthy of the hard work and great creation of our ancestors.

    According to the Yi scriptures we have seen, it can not only study the Yi culture itself and the historical facts of cultural exchanges between ethnic groups, but also now we are in a big family of love and cooperation. A complete history of the People's Republic of China can no longer be like in the past, only focusing on recording the activities of the Han people. It should be comprehensive and must have the history of all brotherly nationalities; but where to collect these historical materials? I think there is no more complete and correct historical material than what they have recorded themselves. We should value it and pay attention to conducting in-depth research. Also, the cultural relics and artworks in the brotherly nationalities, such as the bronze drums, batik embroidery, various handicrafts, inscriptions and ink marks popular in the Southwest brotherly nationalities, are all the ingenious creations of the working people of all dynasties. Many valuable monuments and artworks were stolen by imperialism and reactionaries in collusion in the past. Let me give another example to further confirm the imperialist conspiracy to invade the culture of our brotherly nationalities. For example, the American imperialist running dog Locke sneaked into Lijiang, Yunnan Province in 1923, initially pretending to study plants and hired more than 40 local people to help him work. Later, Locke returned to the United States once and reported that our brotherly nationalities could be deceived, so he returned to Lijiang again on the orders of his master. This time he brought measuring instruments, film equipment, and guns and ammunition, preparing to plunder a large amount. First, he colluded with the reactionary government and measured the borders of Yunnan, Xikang, and Tibet in the name of an advisor to the US Army Survey Bureau, and filmed films and drew military maps to be sent to the US Army Survey Bureau (as evidenced by the map attached to his recently published book "The Ancient Kingdom of Moso"); in addition, he plundered local cultural relics. According to Locke's own confession in his book, he plundered as many as 4,000 Moso classics alone. According to a Moso friend I know, Locke asked him to cooperate several times. He worked with him for four months and found that he had ulterior motives, so he left resolutely; but he personally saw this thief induce a large Lama temple in Tibet to buy the world's unparalleled gold-written Tibetan Tripitaka, which was divided into dozens of boxes and transported back to the United States. Locke stayed in Yunnan for more than 20 years. This man came to Lijiang as a botanist, but he worked as a pickpocket and special agent. Isn't this a clear example? This is the same trick as Stein and Pelliot, who stole the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang under the guise of scholars.

    帝国主义怎样摧残我兄弟民族的文化
    北京大学东方语文系副教授  马学良
    一九四二年，我在云南的一个彝区中调查彝族语文，当时使我惊奇的是足迹所到的区域都有一个大大小小的教会或医院，这教会和医院的负责人多为英美法等国的传教士。他们和兄弟民族过从甚密，时常去传教谈道。我住在一个非教徒的彝民家中，有时这些外国传教士也来和我攀谈，问长问短的，我也并不隐瞒的告诉他们，我是来此研究彝族文化的。可是这消息传出后，我几乎受了监视，他们每天都有人来看我工作，那种狞笑的脸，使我现在想起来，更加憎恨。后来我从一个彝族经师学彝文，同时还有几个彝族青年和我一同学习，他们更惊慌起来了。一次教会上派来一个中国教友游说我，说是奉外国人之命，接我到教会里去住，并且利诱我说，他们那里已经为我刷洗了一所清净的房子，有牛奶面包吃，我婉言谢绝。不久又派来一个所谓“会长”的中国人，态度有点强硬了，同我辩论了一下午，最后取出外国人为当地人所创造的拚音文字，硬逼我放弃学彝文和那一帮青年学他们的拚音文字。过了不久那位会长又来了，他看我们仍然在学彝文，他有些不自在了。我告诉他拚音文字已经学会了，只好继续学彝文。他拿出一本用拚音文字写的圣经考问我们，他看我们全能念得对，也就无话可讲，悻悻然的去了。他们眼见志不得逞，不久便散布将有匪徒劫杀我们的空气，并且警告长住此处，生命没有保障。同我一起工作的彝人都害怕了，各自星散，我只得一个人失望的跑回昆明。当时我还装在闷葫芦里，我学我的彝文，干他何事？屡屡阻扰，不知他们的居心。但我半途而废，心实不甘。恰好在昆明无意中碰到一个彝族土司，我把我的经过和志愿说给他听。他很同情我，立刻答应我去他的土署里学习他所藏的彝经，并且还告诉我他土署里有一个告老回家的老巫师，学识很好，藏经最多，他允许为我介绍，并负责保护我。于是我又随着这位土司回到金沙江边的一个土署中，重温旧课。我自庆因祸得福。过了几个月，我便去访问土司给我介绍的那位藏书最多的老巫师，这位老巫师，已经有七、八十岁了。到了他家里，我同他谈了一阵，说明来由，他好像很恐惶地拒绝所请，谈到经书，他更是讳莫如深地不愿直讲。我有点疑迷了。在他家里住了一个时期，遍访本地人，都异口同声地说他先前藏书确多，后来不知搬到那里去了，连他儿子也不得而知。我很感失望，但我仍然对那老者致弟子礼，必恭必敬地请他口传，笔录学习，经过一个时期，老者见我学习心诚，他受了感动。一天夜间，我和他围坐在地炉旁边向火，我看他噙着眼泪在沉思，似有难言之隐，我便委婉地劝慰他，他只是长吁短叹的不作声，后来他倒问起我来：“我们彝族都不学自己的文字了，你们汉人学它作什么？”我告诉他为了保存彝族的文化，彝文是不能废弃的。他听了我的话，又叹了一口气，黯然良久。我从火光闪烁中看他干枯的脸上浮着无限的苦痛。我给他倒了碗茶，递在他手里，他饮了一口茶，诉出他下面的一段哀怨：
    “我虽是一个彝族巫师，但我总觉得彝经是我们祖先的心血结晶，它是彝族文化的传续者，所以我不像一般的巫师只把它当作职业的工具，因此经常地研习，大量的收藏。后来土署以我学识较好，召充土署巫师。因为土署里藏书较多，在那里又多读了一些向未读过的经书，我更感到彝文经有研究的价值。后来老土司死了，就把那些经书送给我，我就保存起来，日夜焚香虔敬习读。有一年教会上来了几个外国传教士，他们扬言要研究彝经，于是高价收买，当时彝人信以为真，并且有些牟利之徒就大量的出卖；起初我也不知道他们的奸计，为了生活，也想出卖一些，后来想到彝经是天书有神在（按：这是根据一个神话传说来的，说古昔天昏地暗，天宫派神巫骑黄牛驮天书下凡拯救人民。），我们再穷也不能出卖它，但是外国人听说我藏书很多，几次威胁利诱地收买都被我拒绝了。后来从教会里传出一个消息来，说是外国人偷偷把所收买的书全部焚毁了，我听了有点难过，并且惊惶。我赶快跑回来在夜阑人静的时候偷偷把所有的经书全送藏在山洞中，把他封起，我心里才感到一些安慰。从此青年人不念自己祖先留下的彝经了，大家进教堂学什么外国文，读圣经，连我的儿子也不再继承我的衣钵，一样的去学外国文字了，我满腹的哀怨，无人申诉，眼看我们彝族文化要中断了。这次见到了你，起初我以为是汉人也仿外国人的伎俩，想再来一个斩草除根。这些天我看你确实是诚意的学习我们的文字，你肯为我们的文化着想，所以我才把烂在心里十几年的话告诉你，希望你不要向外人说。”老者说完了，又连续地长叹了几声，我也陪着他叹了几口气。夜间我睡在床上，回忆过去我和几个彝族青年同习彝文时，外国传教士威胁利诱地给我们种种的阻难，这时才恍然大悟了。从此我天天劝导老巫师带我去看看那个山洞，把那些经书取回来，但他总是说天意不可违背，尤其怕外国人知道了又要焚书，到那时获罪于天，更不得了。我看他执拗不肯，也不便强人所难，不久就又回到土署里。我曾访问地方上的老人，他们也都知道外国传教士焚书的故事，但却不知道为什么焚他们祖先传下来的经书；反倒歌颂外国人对他们的小惠。我看到土署中和民间流传着还有一部分残余的彝经，若不想法保存，难免再遭毒手。因此急函当时在重庆的文化人，要他们想法收集，不久北京图书馆派万斯年先生来同我洽购，经过许多波折，才收集了一千余册，当时运回分藏于北京图书馆、清华、北大、南开等图书馆，而以北京图书馆所藏为最多。
    如上所述，虽然老巫师所谈的不免带些神话性的色彩，但帝国主义为了毁灭彝族文化而焚书，逼得老巫师把经书暗藏在山洞里，这是千真万确的事实。不但如此，他们既毁灭了彝族的文化，就造出一套以英文字母杂以许多线条式的拼音符号要当地人学习，以作麻醉思想传播毒素的媒介，这种符号就是那位会长要我学习的符号，在西南兄弟民族区域中流传甚广。外国传教士还怕当地人不肯学习，又根据各民族的情形有计划的捏造一套神话，如在苗区中就有如下的传说：“五千年前，苗族始祖蚩尤被黄帝战败后，率族南迁，当时族中固有的书籍，不便带走，又恐迁徙后族人就把文字忘掉，乃下令族中妇女将文字绣于衣角裙边上，所以苗文才得保存下来，今日的苗文，便是把苗族妇女衣裙上的花纹图样加以整理而成的”，凡见到这套符号的人，就知道它颇似苗族妇女衣上所刺绣的花纹。这种蒙蔽手段，有多少兄弟民族曾经受了他们的骗。有些同我谈起，竟说他们不是中国人，问其原因，立即背出一套创世纪给我听，因为他们和外国传教士同是亚当夏娃的后裔，所以他们是同族的人，可见这毒素的危险性太大了。
    帝国主义为了要当地人顺利地接受他们的麻醉毒素，就不择手段地效法秦始皇焚书的毒辣手段，天下还有比灭人之国，毁人文化的罪恶更大么？这种滔天的罪恶，我们要记取，尤其是兄弟民族更应当警惕。以往兄弟民族惨遭帝国主义和大民族主义的同化政策双重压迫，过着苦难的日子，他们不敢读自己祖先遗留下的书，说自己的话。现在是我们人民作主人的时候了，不但有研读自己语文的自由，而且在共同纲领的民族政策中还明文规定“各少数民族均有发展其语言文字、保持或改革其风俗习惯及宗教信仰的自由”。因此我们更应当珍视祖先留下的文化遗产，要好好地学习它，发扬它，批判地接受它，才对得起我们祖先辛辛苦苦的伟大创造。
    据我们所见到的彝文经，它不但可以研究彝族本身的文化及族际间文化交流的史实，而且现在我们处在友爱合作的大家庭中，一部完整的中华人民共和国的国史，不能再像过去只是以纪录汉族的活动为主，它应当是全面的，必须有各兄弟民族的历史；但这些史料从什么地方去采集呢？我认为再没有比他们自己所纪载的史料更完全更正确的。我们应当看重它，注意去作深入的研究。又如兄弟民族中的文物和艺术品如西南兄弟民族中流行的铜鼓腊缬刺绣各种手工业以及碑刻墨迹等，都是历代劳动人民的匠心创作，很多有价值的古迹和艺术品，以往多被帝国主义和反动派勾结盗窃以去。我再举一个实例，更可证实帝国主义对我兄弟民族文化侵略的阴谋。如美帝国主义走狗洛克于一九二三年就混入云南省的丽江，最初冒充研究植物，雇用当地四十余人帮他工作。后来洛克返回美国一次，报告我兄弟民族可欺，于是又奉他主子的命令重返丽江，这次带来了测量器具，电影器材以及枪械子弹，准备大量搜劫。先是与反动政府勾结，以美国陆军测量局顾问的名义测量云南、西康、西藏的边界，并摄制影片，绘成军用地图送交美国陆军测量局（最近他出版的“么些古王国”一书中即附有此地图可证）；另外搜刮当地文物，据洛克书中自己招认，仅么些经典一项搜掠达四千余部。据我所认识的一位么些朋友告诉我，洛克几次央求他合作，他曾和他工作了四个月，发现他居心叵测，就毅然而去；但是他亲眼看到这个贼子曾诱购西藏某大喇嘛寺秘藏的世无其匹的金写藏文大藏经全部，分装数十箱运回美国去了。洛克前后留滇二十余年，这位以植物学家的身份来到丽江，却作起扒手特务的工作，这不是很明显的例子么？这与斯坦因、伯希和等以学者身份窃取敦煌石室的勾当是同一手法的。（转载文物局文物参考资料二卷六期）
