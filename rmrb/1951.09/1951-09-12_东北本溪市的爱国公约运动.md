    The Patriotic Pact Campaign in Benxi City, Northeast China
    From mid-March to "May Day," factories, mines, government offices, industries, streets, and rural areas in Benxi City, Northeast China, universally launched a campaign to establish patriotic pacts. The number of participants accounted for more than 70 percent of the city's total population. When the Benxi City leadership inspected the patriotic pacts in July, they found that although these patriotic pacts had played a certain role, the vast majority were not yet solid. The reason why these patriotic pacts were not solid was that the leading organs did not deeply understand the masses' thoughts and provide specific guidance, making it difficult to constantly bring the masses' patriotic enthusiasm into various specific tasks, thereby improving the masses' political consciousness and improving work. Another reason was that the scope of establishing patriotic pacts was too large, and the content was not specific, making it difficult to implement and impossible to inspect. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the plan of the Benxi City leadership organs is to first promote group patriotic pacts. The focus of work is placed on factories and mines. The steps for implementation are: to convey and arrange the experience and specific practices of the key inspections and group pilot projects in July at the City Workers' Representative Conference and the City Propagandists' Representative Conference respectively; to convene a factory and mine cadres' meeting in early August for deployment, combined with the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, such as the donation movement, as well as the quality inspection, the movement to increase 500,000 tons of grain, etc., to further promote these experiences. The term of each group pact is set to the end of this year. Each group appoints an inspector to check and report at any time, and summarizes and revises it once a month. At the same time, factories and mines are called upon to create advanced patriotic pact groups, especially requiring frequent in-depth work, and each person must make a patriotic oath, which will serve as the basis for launching competitions and implementing patriotic pacts. Benxi City also plans to consolidate and improve the propaganda network work in the process of promoting patriotic pacts, and to make the promotion of patriotic pacts a regular and important work content of the propaganda network in the future, as one of the main conditions for advanced propagandist groups.

    东北本溪市的爱国公约运动
    东北本溪市各厂矿、机关、行业、街道和农村从三月中旬到“五一”，普遍开展了订立爱国公约的运动。参加订约的人数，占全市总人口百分之七十以上。本溪市领导方面七月间检查爱国公约时，发现这些爱国公约虽起了一定的作用，但绝大多数还不巩固。这些爱国公约所以不巩固，是因为领导机关没有深入了解群众的思想情况，并给以具体领导，以致难于把群众的爱国热情经常地发挥到各种具体工作中去，从而提高群众的政治觉悟，改进工作。另一个原因是订立爱国公约的范围太大，内容不具体，难于执行，也无法检查。为了克服这些缺点，本溪市领导机关的计划是首先推广小组爱国公约。工作重点放在厂矿。推行步骤是：把七月份重点抽查和小组试点的经验与具体作法分别在市工人代表会议、市宣传员代表会议上作传达布置，八月初召开厂矿干部会议进行布置，结合捐献运动等项抗美援朝工作，以及质量大检查，增加五十万吨粮食运动等，把这些经验进一步推广。各小组公约约期订到今年年底。每小组推定检查员随时检查汇报，每月总结修订一次。同时号召各厂矿单位，创造先进爱国公约小组，特别要求经常深入，每人须订出爱国誓约书，以此作为发动竞赛，实现和推行爱国公约的基础。本溪市并计划在推行爱国公约中，把宣传网工作巩固起来并提高一步，并把推行爱国公约当成今后宣传网经常的重要工作内容，作为先进宣传员小组的主要条件之一。
