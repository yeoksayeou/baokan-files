Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: According to the "Labor-Farmer News", the central organ of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party, the Japan Labor-Farmer Party held its third Central Committee meeting in Tokyo on August 4th and 5th. The conference passed the following resolutions as goals for the current struggle: Resolution on strengthening the struggle for a comprehensive peace treaty, resolution on striving for the immediate opening of Sino-Japanese trade, and resolution on strengthening the party organization. The meeting issued a declaration on August 5th, calling on the Japanese people to take action to smash the Yoshida cabinet's conspiracy to go to San Francisco to sign a separate peace treaty.

The resolution on strengthening the struggle for a comprehensive peace treaty called on Labor-Farmer Party members to participate in the struggle against signing a separate peace treaty, and to smash the separate peace that threatens Japan's independence and peace. It called to expose the Yoshida cabinet's conspiracy by all means. At the same time, to participate in various peace movement groups to strengthen the peace movement.

The resolution on striving for the immediate opening of Sino-Japanese trade stated: The demand for the immediate opening of Sino-Japanese trade is the voice of the entire Japanese nation. There can be no hope of opening Sino-Japanese trade without a comprehensive peace treaty. Sino-Japanese trade has a significant impact on Japanese industry, especially on peaceful industries, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the lives of workers.

The declaration of the conference stated: We oppose war, therefore we oppose the separate peace treaty to be signed in San Francisco. We oppose this separate peace treaty that stipulates the permanent stationing of foreign troops in Japan and the provision of military bases to foreign countries. We demand peace. Therefore, we oppose this separate peace treaty that treats China and the Soviet Union as enemies and undermines peace in Asia and the world. We demand national independence and prosperity, therefore we oppose this separate peace treaty that turns Japan into a colony, undermines peaceful industries, deprives us of freedom of trade, especially deprives us of trade with China, which is of great importance to the Japanese economy.

The declaration said: However, the Yoshida traitorous cabinet shamelessly propagandizes that this separate peace treaty is "generous" and a treaty of "reconciliation." In reality, he wants to isolate Japan from the whole of Asia.

The declaration pointed out: We are not isolated. The countries that support this draft treaty are very few, especially the neighboring countries in Asia, all of whom oppose this draft treaty. Including the people of the United States and Britain, peace-loving people all over the world oppose it.

The declaration called on the Japanese people to unite and smash the wicked ambitions of the Yoshida cabinet. To use all mass actions to smash the Yoshida cabinet's conspiracy to sign a separate peace treaty, to strive for a comprehensive peace treaty, and to defend Japan's independence and world peace.

    日本劳农党中央委员会会议通过决议
    加强争取全面对日和约斗争
    号召日本人民粉碎吉田反动政府单独媾和阴谋
   【新华社一日讯】据日本劳农党中央机关报“劳农新闻”消息：日本劳农党于八月四、五两日在东京举行第三届中央委员会会议。大会通过了下列各项决议作为当前斗争的目标：加强争取全面媾和的斗争的决议、争取立即开放中日贸易的决议以及加强党的组织的决议。会议于八月五日发表宣言，号召日本人民行动起来，粉碎吉田内阁到旧金山去签订单独和约的阴谋。
    关于加强争取全面媾和的斗争的决议，号召劳农党员参加反对在单独和约上签字的斗争，粉碎威胁日本独立与和平的单独媾和。用一切方法揭露吉田内阁的阴谋。同时，参加各种和平运动团体，以加强和平运动。
    关于争取立即开放中日贸易的决议说：立即开放中日贸易的要求，是全日本民族的呼声。不是全面媾和，便不可能有开放中日贸易的希望。中日贸易对日本工业，特别是对和平工业、中小企业以及工人生活有重大的影响。
    大会的宣言说：我们反对战争，因此我们反对准备在旧金山签订的单独和约。反对这个规定外国军队永久驻扎日本，向外国提供军事基地的单独和约。我们要求和平。因此我们反对这个把中、苏两国作为敌人，破坏亚洲及世界和平的单独和约。我们要求民族独立与繁荣，因此我们反对这个使日本变成殖民地、破坏和平工业、剥夺贸易自由，特别是剥夺了对日本经济有重大关系的与中国的贸易的单独和约。
    宣言说：然而吉田卖国内阁竟恬不知耻地宣传说：这个单独和约是“宽大”的，是“和解”的和约。实际上他要使日本与整个的亚洲隔离开来。
    宣言指出：我们不是孤立的。赞成这个和约草案的国家是极少数的，尤其是亚洲的邻国，全都反对这个和约草案。包括美、英两国人民在内，全世界爱好和平的人民都反对它。
    宣言号召日本人民团结起来粉碎万恶的吉田内阁的野心。用一切群众行动粉碎吉田内阁签订单独和约的阴谋，尽力争取全面和约，保卫日本的独立和世界和平。
