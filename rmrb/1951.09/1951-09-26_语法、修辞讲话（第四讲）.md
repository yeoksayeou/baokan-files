Grammar and Rhetoric Talks (Lecture 4)
    Lü Shuxiang Zhu Dexi
    Ninth Paragraph: Disorganized Structure
    Structural Entanglement – "Indecisiveness." Structural disorganization is a broad category; in a broad sense, most of what has been said in the previous eight paragraphs can be included in it. Here, we will discuss situations that cannot be categorized using terms like "subject" or "object." The most common issue is the unclear entanglement of two structures within a single sentence. For ease of explanation, we will further divide it into several types. The first type can be called "indecisiveness": the author sometimes intends to use one structure and sometimes another, resulting in the use of both. For example:

    (1) Women who have been oppressed and ravaged under the old marriage system for many years have also awakened. (Newspaper)
    (2) The "Hengshan" furnace was finally repaired by Jia Zhendong and his fellow workers through arduous and heroic work. (Manuscript)
    (3) The other side of this heroic and tragic act is still a manifestation of insufficient self-confidence. (Newspaper)
    (4) It is hoped that car drivers and citizens will accept this serious lesson, raise their vigilance... to avoid minimizing losses of life and property. (Newspaper)
    (5) Mr. Bainqen Erdini will visit our school today. It is hereby decided to convene a welcome meeting for all teachers, students, and staff in the auditorium at 5:00 PM this afternoon. All offices will stop working at 4:50 PM in the afternoon. (Notice)
    (6) This is a problem of understanding life, this is the ability to observe reality, this is what every author should pay serious attention to. (Newspaper)
    (7) This government that serves the people does not only build ditches for main roads, but also takes care of remote areas that have always been neglected by the reactionary government. (Newspaper)
    (8) In the past, work was not accounted for, so there are concerns about whether the currently stipulated unit price can earn grain, or even result in losses. (Manuscript)
    (9) Can this be as Mr. Sun Yu, the director of "The Life of Wu Xun," said, that he "stood firmly on the class stand and waged a lifelong struggle against the rulers"? (Newspaper)
    (10) Regarding this issue, I would like to first introduce a few excerpts from the outline of Comrade Rudasutak's report entitled "The Tasks of Trade Unions in Production," which Comrade Lenin repeatedly praised and read in its entirety in his speech entitled "On Trade Unions, the Current Situation, and Comrade Trotsky's Mistakes." (Newspaper)

    (1) One should choose between the two formats: "having been... ravaged" and "under...ravaged." (2) One should choose between "after... work" and "under... work" (the first format is better). (3) One should choose between "... the other side is still insufficient self-confidence" and "...act is still a manifestation of insufficient self-confidence." (4) One should choose between "to avoid losses of life and property" and "to minimize losses of life and property." (5) One should choose between "afternoon closing time is advanced to 4:50" and "close in the afternoon before 4:50" (the second format is better). (6) One should choose between "This is what every author should seriously pay attention to" and "This is what every author (should) seriously pay attention to" (the first format cannot use "所"). Also, the first half of this sentence is also flawed; the author probably means "This is the problem of understanding life, this is the problem of observing reality." (7) One should choose between "not only... but also..." and "not first... but first..." (according to the author's meaning, it should be the first format). (8) One should choose between "whether one can earn grain, whether one will not lose money, there are concerns" and "...there are concerns, fearing that one will not earn grain, or even lose money" (the second format is better). (9) One should choose between "Can this be like... saying that he stood firmly on...?" and "Is it as... said, that he stood firmly on...?" (10) One should choose between "first introduce Lenin's... report outline" and "first extract a few paragraphs from Lenin's... report outline."

    --"Persistent Connections." The second type is where the structure of a sentence is already complete, but its last part is used as the beginning of another sentence. For example:

    (11) It is the people's responsibility for us to make suggestions to the government. (Letter)
    (12) In the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House, to publish a translated work, it takes the efforts of how many people before it can meet the readers. (Periodical)
    (13) With great difficulty, she painstakingly raised me until I was nine years old, the year that the Japanese invaders invaded Shanghai. (Letter)
    (14) When the higher authorities announced the establishment of our film crew and specifically assigned us this task, everyone had a feeling of both glory and joy that was quite difficult to describe. (Periodical)
    (15) If you don't put more effort into observation and write blindly, please think about what kind of bad consequences will occur, which is self-evident. (Periodical)

    (11) It is putting "we make suggestions to the government" and "making suggestions to the government is the people's responsibility" together. "We" should be deleted. (12) It is putting "to publish... efforts" and "a translated work... meet" together. Either sentence can be used. (13) It is putting "...raised me to nine years old" and "the year I was nine years old, the Japanese invaders invaded Shanghai" together. "The year" should be changed to "in that year." (14) It is putting "everyone has... feeling" and "(this) glorious... is quite difficult to describe" together. The word "有" (have) can be changed to "的" (of), or "quite difficult to describe" can be moved after "有." (15) It is putting "please think about... bad consequences?" and "that will... self-evident" together. One should be chosen.

    --"Changing Course Midway." The third type is where a sentence is half-said, and suddenly a new start is made. This type of example is very common, indicating that it is a frequently made mistake. For example:

    (16) Since the Chinese people accepted Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese revolution, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, has greatly changed its appearance. (Periodical)
    (17) At the most recent meeting of the Allied Council for Japan, British Commonwealth representative Hodgson at least outwardly expressed that the British Commonwealth government is also very concerned about the revival of Japanese militarism. (Periodical)
    (18) "This person is uniquely haggard" is about two brothers who both participated in the patriotic movement and were obstructed by their stubborn father... Unfortunately, due to Bing Xin's background, her environment, her philosophy of love, both of these brothers surrendered. (Education)
    (19) After several months of "military actions" by the American imperialists, the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to the invaders. (Periodical)
    (20) When hospital nurse Wang Chuanjian appeared on stage in her performance of "Old Zhao Turns Over," her mother-in-law in the audience was so happy that she leaned forward and backward. (Periodical)
    (21) For example, Du Chongyuan, with his article "Idle Talk about the Emperor," was considered to have offended the Japanese emperor and was imprisoned, which is an example. (Periodical)
    (22) The most important thing for obese people in terms of the digestive tract is that various illnesses are caused by poor blood circulation, such as bloating, constipation, hemorrhoids, gallstones, nephritis, and abdominal wall small intestine hernia. (Newspaper)
    (23) Every movement, on the surface, is done in full swing, bustling with activity, but how much actual effect has it had, how much result has it achieved, is truly minimal. (Periodical)
    (24) As for the issue of notifying the paper company and Qian Yuan Money House to establish a major contract, whether it falls within the scope of this office's business, and before the ownership registration has been obtained, that is, before the property rights have been completely determined, in principle, it should not be transferred. (Letter)

    (16) "Since the Chinese people accepted Marxism-Leninism" what? The author does not continue, but starts another sentence with "the Chinese revolution." It should be changed to "Since the Chinese people..." The following sentences are similar. (17) It should be changed to "At the most recent meeting of the Allied Council for Japan." (18) It should be changed to "Unfortunately, due to Bing Xin's background..." (19) "Imperialists" should be removed, or used to replace "invaders." (20) It should be changed to "When hospital nurse Wang Chuanjian played..."
    (21) It should be changed to "Because Du Chongyuan wrote... an article, he was considered to have..." The original sentence makes people who do not know the beginning and end of this matter misunderstand that Du Chongyuan sent others to prison, which is very inappropriate. (22) It should be changed to "Obese people can also have various illnesses in the digestive tract, such as..., mainly because of poor blood circulation." (23) It should be changed to "It is really hard to say how much actual effect it has had, and how much result it has achieved" or "The actual effect and the results achieved are truly minimal." (Furthermore, "play a role" and "achieve results" are the same meaning here, one can be omitted.) (24) "Still difficult to decide" should be added under "whether it belongs to the scope of the business of this office," or "whether it belongs to" should be changed to "does not belong to."

    --"The Guest Usurps the Host's Position." The fourth type is that the component other than the subject in the first half of the sentence is used as the subject of the second half of the sentence, thus causing entanglement. (See the section "Secretly Changing the Subject" in the first paragraph.) For example:
    (25) Therefore, when the bandit troops attacked the guerrillas by surprise, they were surrounded by the guerrillas and countless bandit troops were annihilated. (Newspaper)
    (26) As everyone knows, this small gathering could be discovered by secret agent students at any time, directly disrupted, or have the power lines cut. (Newspaper)
    (27) I, who don't know the price of rice, have never cared about or needed to care about things at home. (Newspaper)
    (28) The US imperialism's reactionary measures in Japan and against Asian countries should be resolutely attacked, and it can be defeated. (Newspaper)
    (29) Regarding the crimes of the landlord class, one cannot thoroughly understand them without on-the-spot observation, and therefore, one cannot understand what kind of force their crimes are that is sufficient to hinder the development of the new China. (Newspaper)
    (30) Looking down on people of color and practicing racial discrimination has always been inseparable from imperialism, and US imperialism is especially so. (Periodical)

    (25) The subject of "being surrounded by the guerrillas" is "bandit troops," but the subject of "annihilated countless bandit troops" can only be "guerrillas," but the author completed it in one go without explanation. The last clause should be changed to "annihilated a large part (or: countless)." In this way, "annihilated" follows "being surrounded by the guerrillas," and it is coherent. (26) Same problem. "Small gatherings" can be "discovered," but they cannot be "directly disrupted or cut off the power lines." "They will come" should be added before "directly disrupt." (27) "Things at home" is the object of "care" in the first half of the sentence; in the second half of the sentence, it becomes the subject of "no need." This sentence is not easy to change. If it is changed to "I have never cared about things at home, and I don't need to care about them," there is no place for "not knowing the price of rice." (28) Judging from the first half of the sentence, who should "attack"? Of course, it is "we," but this word is hidden and does not appear, and the formal subject is "US imperialism's reactionary measures" which should be attacked. However, the subject of "can defeat it" in the second half of the sentence cannot still be "US imperialism's reactionary measures," but can only be "we." "We" should be added to this sentence before "should," otherwise, the word "it" should be eliminated. (29) The main problem is exactly the same as the previous sentence, the subject of the first half of the sentence is "crime," and the subject of the second half of the sentence can only be the hidden "we." There are also several minor problems: "Regarding" is unnecessary; there is no cause and effect between the first and second parts, and "therefore" cannot be used; what becomes the force hindering development is not the crimes of the landlord class, but the class itself. This sentence should be changed to "Without on-the-spot observation, we cannot thoroughly understand the crimes of the landlord class, and we cannot understand what kind of..." (30) "Imperialism" is not the subject in the first half of the sentence, but it must be the subject in order to say "and US imperialism is especially so" in the second half of the sentence. Therefore, one has to change "has always been inseparable from imperialism" to "all imperialism is the same."

    Structure Ambiguity and Disorder. The structure of the following two sentences is ambiguous, and there can be two interpretations.

    (31) The creation method of real people and real events has been advocated in recent years, and many works that write real people and real events have been produced. (Education)
    (32) But among the people in the Chinese revolution, the confidence and optimism they have in the revolutionary struggle has already grown a new person. (Education) (31) The "produce" can be no subject, or "creation method" can be used as the subject, and both analyzes make sense. The author's meaning may be the first, then the first half of the sentence should be changed to "In recent years, the creation method of real people and real events has been advocated." (32) There are also two analysis methods, but both have problems. If "among the Chinese revolutionary people" (the "的" between "Chinese" and "revolutionary" is essential) skips the middle phrase and directly goes to "already...", the meaning is smooth, but the phrase "their... optimism" has no settlement. If this phrase is the subject of "growing a new person," then the verb "growing" is used inappropriately. The author's meaning may be the latter, then "growing" should be changed to "raising" or "nurturing."

    The following two sentences are very long, and the author did not take care of them, so they are inevitably a bit chaotic.

    (33) Simonov does not need to drill into the lives of Americans at all levels, does not need to interview bit by bit, or live for a long time, because he has a very clear political view, he only needs to take a turn in the United States to understand the most important things in life, and it is very vivid, can you say that it is not like Americans? (Education)
    (34) This is a very important political mobilization of the working class that cannot be underestimated. Because it occurred in Spain after thirteen years of bloody rule by the fascist Franco, because this fascist lackey is receiving the special favor of his master—because the military inferiority of other Western European countries has led to a special reliance on this lackey who inherited the mantle of German and Italian fascism and retains traditional fascist armed forces, this launch is an extraordinarily heavy blow to the imperialist group. (Periodical)

    (33) There are two problems. First, the current position of the clause "because he has a very clear political view" is the worst position. It should be placed at the beginning or after "...the most important things." It is better to put it at the beginning and change it to "Because he..." Second, the subject of "it is very vivid" is unclear, and "what Americans?" in "can you say that it is not like Americans?" is also unknown. These two clauses should probably be changed to: "and vividly express it. (Sentence break.) Can you say that the Americans under his pen are not like Americans?" (34) It can also be divided into two points. First, the head and tail are two affirmative propositions, and the two "because" in the middle explain the reasons. Does it explain the previous proposition or the latter proposition? Both make sense, but it can never be used in both ways—there is no such structure. The first proposition should be made into an independent sentence. Second, the author wrote the phrase "because... special reliance" as an appositive to "special favor." However, it is rare to use an appositive to explain a reason, and such a long subject-predicate phrase almost exceeds the scope that Chinese can allow. It should be changed into a clause, "Because the military inferiority of other Western European countries has left US with no option but to be especially dependent on this... lackey." Two dashes should be used before and after; without the dash in the back, the boundary with the main proposition "this launch..." is unclear.

    Unbalanced Structure. Modern articles are different from past classical Chinese, and do not emphasize neat sentence structure or neat antithetical couplets, which is correct. However, this only refers to strict parallel sentence structure. General structural neatness is also an element of rhetoric, and it is needed in certain occasions. For example:

    (35) In the morning I still saw smoke, what I saw at noon was already flames. (Periodical)
    (36) It is only the most beneficial to the people and helpful to national construction. (Work)

    (35) Why not say "What I saw in the morning was still smoke, what I saw at noon was already flames"?
    (36) Why not say "It is only the most beneficial to the people and the most helpful to national construction"? The neatness of these two sentences is not very important. The following three sentences are all related to empty words, and there is a greater need for adjustment.

    (37) This is not only that the Soviet scientific community lost one of their excellent leaders, but also a major loss to the world scientific community. (Periodical)
    (38) Representatives were sent to negotiate with the capitalists on the spot, asking the capitalists to pay the wages during the shutdown on the one hand, and asking him to start work quickly on the other hand. (Newspaper)
    (39) This time, a big disaster was caused. In addition to being beaten by Master Jia, the manager and foreman also got up. The foreman picked up a small hammer and hit him on the head, knocking him unconscious. (Periodical)

    (37) After "not only" there is a sentence format, and after "but also" there is a phrase, which is unbalanced. It should be changed to "Not only did the Soviet scientific community lose..., the world scientific community also suffered a major loss." (38) "Asking the capitalists to pay on the one hand" and "asking him (=the capitalist) on the other hand" are also unbalanced. There are two ways to change it: either change the front to "to ask the capitalists to pay on the one hand," or cancel "ask him" in the back. The second change is better. (39) "In addition to" is followed by "he" being beaten, and then further down it is people beating "him," which is also an unbalanced sentence structure. It should be changed to "In addition to Master Jia beating him, the manager and foreman..."

    (40) Moreover, rewards will inspire a sense of responsibility, strengthen the care for machinery and equipment, and reduce the loss rate of materials and tools, which complements production competitions. (Manuscript) The "inspire...", "strengthen to...", "reduce..." in this sentence are also examples of being neat, but not being neat. The latter two should be changed to "strengthen the sense of care for machinery and equipment" and "reduce the loss rate of materials and tools."

    Lack of Empty Words and Similar Components. Sometimes we will unintentionally ask a word to perform two tasks, mostly when the word is to be repeated in the structure. For example:

    (41) After the speech at the memorial meeting, the Yue opera "Xianglin Sao" adapted from Lu Xun's posthumous work [Blessing] and the film "Xianglin Sao" produced were shown. (Newspaper)
    (42) For any disease that can be cured quickly with efficient drugs, never use the method of slowly treating with inefficient drugs. (Manuscript)
    (43) In a small number of areas, there are still inevitably intentional or unintentional excavations or damages. (Periodical) According to the structural requirements, (41) should be "according to (the Yue opera "Xianglin Sao" adapted from Lu Xun's posthumous work) and the film "Xianglin Sao" produced," (42) should be "never use (the method of slowly treating with inefficient drugs)." "According to according to" and "use use" are naturally too outrageous, but if one is used as two, the structure is incomplete, which is not a solution. You have to think of other ways. (41) can be changed to "Xianglin Sao, adapted from Lu Xun's posthumous work 'Blessing' into a Yue opera and then filmed." (42) can remove "the method." (43) There should be a "有" before "intentional unintentional." This is different from the previous two examples, and does not need to be worried, because "intentional" is a word, and is not using two "有" in tandem. However, there is a grammatical error in using "intentional unintentional" here. First, "intentional unintentional" means "seeming intentional and seeming unintentional." Here it should say "intentional or unintentional"; second, only "damage" may be "intentional or unintentional." Since it is called "excavation," how can it be said to be "unintentional"? It should be changed to "There are inevitably intentional excavations or unintentional damages." "Situations" can be omitted, and "happened" can be omitted even more.

    (44) In a barrack in Xiyuan that was once a warlord of the Northern Warlords, intellectuals carrying heavy ideological burdens went in in a continuous stream, exchanging it for a cavity of revolutionary enthusiasm. (Periodical)
    (45) If there is a problem with the translated book, it is not entirely due to the translator's lack of foreign language proficiency, but also because some of them lack the cultivation of a certain discipline, so the translation has problems. (Periodical) These two sentences are different from the above three sentences. (44) "Used to be the barracks of the Northern Warlords" what? There is a lack of a noun. If it is just saying "a barracks in Xiyuan," then this barracks "used to be the Northern Warlords," which is even more incomprehensible. It should be changed to "In a row of houses in Xiyuan that used to be the barracks of the Northern Warlords." (45) "Some of" what? According to the meaning, of course, it is "translators," but according to the structure, it can only be "translated books." It should be changed to "Some are due to the translator's..."

    Incomplete Sentence. When a sentence is long, the author often forgets that there was a causative conjunction at the beginning, and the following text loses its response, becoming headless. There are many such sentences, because there is nothing to discuss, so here is an example as a bad example.

    (46) Therefore, although the Chinese national bourgeoisie has complex connections with the comprador class and feudal forces, and is now in the era of imperialism and the proletarian revolution, they have become an extremely weak class in the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. (Newspaper)

    语法、修辞讲话（第四讲）
    吕叔湘  朱德熙
    第九段  结构杂乱
    结构纠缠——“举棋不定”。结构杂乱是个很大的类名，广义地说，前八段里面所说的有一大部分都可以包括在内。这里再谈谈那些不能用“主语”“宾语”等等来归类的情形。这里面最常见的是一句之内两种结构纠缠不清。为了说明的方便，我们再把它分成几个类型。第一个类型可以称为“举棋不定”：作者时而要用这种结构，时而要用那种结构，结果是两种结构都用了。例如：
    （一）多年来曾被旧婚姻制度压迫蹂躏下的妇女
            也觉悟起来。（报）
        （二）“横山”炉在贾振东和工友们共同经过艰
            苦而英勇的工作，终于修复起来。（稿）
    （三）这种慷慨悲歌的壮举的背面，还是自信心
            不够的表现。（报）
    （四）希望汽车司机和市民接受这一严重教训，
            提高警惕……才能避免生命财产少受损失。
    （报）
    （五）班禅额尔德尼先生今日来本校参观，兹定
            于下午五时召集全体师生员工在大礼堂开欢
            迎大会，各办公室下午下班时间提早于四时
            五十分停止办公。（件）
    （六）这是对生活认识的问题，这是对现实观察
            的能力，这是要求每一位作者所应当严肃
            注意的。（报）
    （七）这个为人民服务的政府并不只为通衢大路
            修沟，而是也首先顾到一向为反动政府所忽
            视的偏僻地方。（报）
    （八）过去做工不算账，因此对于现在规定的单
            价，能否赚粮，甚至赔本，有顾虑。（稿）
    （九）这能不能如“武训传”的编导者孙瑜先生
            所说，他“站稳了阶级的立场，向统治者作
            了一生一世的斗争”呢？（报）
    （十）关于这个问题，在这里我首先介绍一下列
            宁同志在题为“论职工会、目前形势及托洛
            斯基同志底错误”的演讲中所一再称赞而且
            全文宣读过的，鲁得苏塔克同志的以“职工
            会在生产中的任务”为题的那个报告提纲中
            摘引几段。（报）
    （一）应该在“曾被……蹂躏的”和“在……蹂躏下的”两个格式里选用一个。（二）应该在“经过……的工作”和“在……的工作下”里选用一个
    （第一式较好）。（三）应该在“……的背面还是自信心不够”和“……壮举还是自信心不够的表现”里选用一个。（四）应该在“才能避免生命财产的损失”和“才能使生命财产少受损失”里选用一个。（五）应该在“下午下班时间提早为四时五十分”和“下午提早于四时五十分停止办公”里选用一个（第二式较好）。（六）应该在“这是要求每一位作者严肃注意的”和“这是每一位作者（所）应当严肃注意的”里选用一个（第一式不能用“所”）。又，这一句的上半句也欠妥，作者意思大约是“这是认识生活的问题，这是观察现实的问题”。（七）应该在“不只……而且也……”和“不先……而首先……”里选用一个（按作者的意思应该是第一式）。（八）应该在“能否赚粮，能否不至于赔本，有顾虑”和“……有顾虑，怕不能赚粮，甚至要赔本”里选用一个（第二式较好）。（九）应该在“这能不能像……那样，说他是站稳了……呢？”和“他是不是如……所说，站稳了……呢？”里选用一个。（十）应该在“首先介绍一下列宁……报告提纲”和“首先在列宁……报告提纲中摘引几段”里选用一个。
    ——“藕断丝连”。第二个类型是一句话的结构已经完整，却把它的最后一部分用作另一句的起头。例如：
    （十一）我们向政府提意见是人民的责任。（
            信）
    （十二）在苏联外文出版局，要出版一本译作是
            要经过多少人的努力以后，才能与读者见面
            的。（期）
    （十三）好不容易，她辛辛苦苦地终于把我养到
            了九岁的那年，日寇侵略上海。（信）
    （十四）当上级宣布我们摄制组成立并具体交付
            给我们这任务的时候，大家有既光荣又愉快
            的感觉是颇难形容的。（期）
        （十五）你不在观察上多下工夫，就昧然写作，
            请想想那将发生怎样的恶果，是不言可喻的
                了。（期）
    （十一）是把“我们向政府提意见”和“向政府提意见是人民的责任”凑在一块儿。应该删去“我们”。
    （十二）是把“要出版……的努力的”和“一本译作……见面的”凑在一块儿。随便用哪一句都成。
    （十三）是把“……把我养到了九岁”和“我九岁的那年，日寇侵略上海”凑在一块儿。应该把“的那年”改做“就在那一年”。（十四）是把“大家有……感觉”和“（这种）既光荣……是颇难形容的”凑在一块儿。可以把“有”字改做“的”字，也可以把“颇难形容的”挪在“有”字之后。（十五）是把“请想想……恶果？”和“那将……不言可喻的了”凑在一块儿。应该选择一个。
    ——“中途易辙”。第三个类型是一句话说了一半，忽然另起炉灶，重来一句。这种例子非常多，可见是常犯的一种毛病。例如：
    （十六）中国人民自从接受了马列主义思想之
            后，中国的革命就在毛泽东同志领导下大大
            改了样子。（期）
    （十七）盟国对日委员会在最近一次会议上，英
            联邦代表霍奇逊至少在表面上表示，英联邦
            政府也非常忧虑日本军国主义复活。（期）
    （十八）“斯人独憔悴”是写两兄弟都参加爱国
            运动，受到顽固父亲的阻挠……可惜冰心由
            于她的出身，她的环境，她的爱的哲学，这
            两兄弟都投降了。（教）
    （十九）美帝国主义者经过几个月来的“军事行
            动”，形势是越来越于侵略者不利了。（期）
    （二十）医院护士王传建，当她演“老赵翻身记”
            出现在舞台上时，她的老婆母在台下乐得前
            仰后合。（期）
    （二一）例如杜重远以“闲话天皇”这一篇文
            章，认为是冒犯了日本皇帝，置之于狱，就
            是例子。（期）
    （二二）肥胖的人在消化道方面，最主要的是因
        为血液循环不畅的缘故而引起了各种病苦，
            如气胀、便泌、痔疮、胆石症、肾脏炎、腹
            壁小肠疝气等。（报）
    （二三）每一个运动，表面上搞得如火如荼，热
            闹万分，实际起了多少作用，收了多少效
            果，真是微乎其微。（期）
        （二四）至于通知造纸公司与干源钱庄成立大契
            问题，是否属于本处业务范围，并且在所有
            权登记还没有领证，也就是产权还没有完全
            确定以前，原则上是不应该移转的。（信）
    （十六）“中国人民自从接受了马列主义思想之后”怎么样？作者不接下去，却用“中国的革命”另起一句。应该改做“自从中国人民……之后”。底下几句都是同样情形。（十七）应该改做“在盟国对日委员会的最近一次会议上”。（十八）应该改做“可惜由于冰心的出身……”。（十九）应该去掉“帝国主义者”，或是用它替代“侵略者”。（二十）应该改做“当医院护士王传建演……时”。
    （二一）应该改做“因为杜重远写了……文章，就认为他是……”。原句使不知道这件事情的始末的人误会杜重远把别人送进监牢，非常不妥。（二二）应该改做“肥胖的人在消化道方面也会有种种病苦，如……，主要是因为血液循环不畅”。（二三）应该改做“实际起了多少作用，收了多少效果，真是难说”，或是“实际上起的作用，收的效果，真是微乎其微”。（并且，“起作用”和“收效果”在这里是一个意思，可以省掉一个。）（二四）应该在“是否属于本处业务范围”底下加“尚难决定”，或是把“是否属于”改做“不属于”。
    ——“反客为主”。第四个类型是把上半句里的主语以外的成分用来做下半句的主语，因此而纠缠。
    （参阅第一段“暗中更换主语”节。）例如：
    （二五）因此，当匪军们偷袭游击队的时候，被
            游击队反包围，歼灭了无数匪军。（报）
    （二六）大家都知道，这个小集会随时都有可能
            被特务学生发现，直接捣乱或割断电线的。
                （报）
    （二七）食米不知米价的我，家里的事情是一向
            不管也用不着我管的。（报）
    （二八）美帝在日本及其对于亚洲国家的反动措
            施，是应当加以坚决打击，而且能够把它击
            败的。（报）
    （二九）关于地主阶级的罪行，非经过实地观察
            是不会透彻了解的，因而也就不能了解他们
            的罪恶是怎样一个足以阻碍新中国发展的力
            量。（报）
        （三十）看不起有色人种，实行种族歧视，本来
            就是与帝国主义分不开的，而以美帝国主义
            为尤甚。（期）
    （二五）“被游击队反包围”的主语是“匪军”，但“歼灭了无数匪军”的主语只能是“游击队”，作者却把它一气呵成，不加交代。应该把末一分句改做“歼灭了一大部分（或：不计其数）”；这样，
    “歼灭”是接着“被游击队”下来的，就连贯了。
    （二六）毛病相同。“小集会”是可以被“发现”的，但不能被“直接捣乱或割断电线”。应该在“直接捣乱”之前加“他们就会来”。（二七）“家里的事情”在上半句是“管”的宾语；到了下半句又变了“用不着”的主语。这句不大好改。如果改做“家里的事情我一向不管，也用不着我管”，“食米不知米价”就没有地方搁。（二八）就上半句说，谁“加以打击”？当然是“我们”，但这个词隐而未现，正式主语是应当受打击的“美帝的反动措施”。可是下半句的“能够把它击败”的主语就不可能还是“美帝的反动措施”而只能是“我们”。这一句应该在“是应当”前加“我们”，要不就把“把它”二字取消。（二九）主要的毛病完全跟上一句相同，前半句的主语是“罪行”，后半句的主语可只能是隐而未现的“我们”。还多几个小毛病：“关于”是用不着的；前后两截中间无因果可言，用不上“因而”；成为阻碍发展的力量的不是地主阶级的罪恶，而是这个阶级本身。这句应该改做“非经过实地观察，我们不会透彻了解地主阶级的罪行，更不能了解它是怎样一个……”。（三十）“帝国主义”在上半句不是主语，但是必须它是主语，下半句才能说“而以美帝国主义为尤甚”。所以不得不把“本来就是与帝国主义分不开的”改做“所有帝国主义都是如此”。
    结构含混和错乱。下面这两句的结构含混，都可以有两种解释。
    （三一）真人真事的创作方法，近几年来曾倡导
            过，而且产生了许多写真人真事的作品。（
            教）
    （三二）但在中国革命的人们中，他们在革命的
            战斗里所具有的信心和乐观，已经在生长一
            种新的人。（教）（三一）的“产生”可以是无主语，也可以拿“创作方法”做主语，两种分析在意义上都讲得通。作者的意思也许是第一种，那么上半句应该改做“近几年来曾倡导过真人真事的创作方法”。（三二）也有两种分析法，可是都有问题。如果让“在中国的革命的人们中”（“中国”和“革命”中间的“的”字不可少）跳过中间的短语，直接下面的“已经………”，意思通顺，但“他们………乐观”这个短语无着落。如果说这个短语是“生长一种新的人”的主语，“生长”这个动词就用的不妥当。作者的意思也许是后者，那么应该把“生长”改做“养育”或“孕育”。
    下面两句都很长，作者照顾不周到，因而不免有点乱。
        （三三）西蒙诺夫并不需要钻到美国人各阶层的
            生活里去，并不需要点点滴滴去采访，或长
            时期生活，他因为有极明确的政治观点，他
            只要在美国去走一转就领会到生活中最重要
            的东西，而且是非常形象的，你能说那不像
            美国人么？（教）
        （三四）这是一个不能加以低估的工人阶级的极
            重要的政治发动，由于它发生于经过法西斯
            佛朗哥十三年血腥统治之后的西班牙，由于
            这个法西斯走狗正在受着他的主子的特殊的
            青睐——因为西欧其他国家军事上的藐不足
            道而对这个继承了德意法西斯衣钵，保有传
            统的法西斯武装的走狗的特殊依赖，这次发
            动对帝国主义集团的打击是异常沉重的。（
                期）
    （三三）有两个毛病。第一，“他因为有极明确的政治观点”这个分句的现在的位置是最坏的位置，应该放在头上，或是放在“……最重要的东西，”之后。放在头上较好，并且要改做“因为他……”。第二，“是非常形象的”的主语不明，“那不像美国人么？”的“那”也不知何所指。这两个分句恐怕应该改做：“而且很形象地把它表现出来。（断句。）你能说他笔底下的美国人不像美国人么？”（三四）也可以分两点来说。第一，一头一尾是两个肯定的命题，当中两个“由于”说明原因。是说明前一命题还是后一命题的呢？都讲得通，但是决不能两用——没有这样的结构。应该让第一个命题独立成句。第二点，“因为……特殊依赖”这个短语，作者是把它当作“特殊的青睐”的同位语写上去的。但是用同位语说明原因是少见的，而且这么长的主从短语也几乎超出了汉语所能容许的范围。应该把它改做一个分句，“因为西欧其他国家军事上的藐不足道，美国不得不特殊依赖这个……走狗。”前后该用两个破折号；后面不用破折号，跟主要命题“这次发动……”的界限不清。
    结构不整齐。现代的文章跟过去的文言文不同，不讲究句法整齐，对仗工稳，这是不错的。可是这只是指严格的骈偶句法而言，一般的结构整齐也是修辞的一个要素，在一定的场合是有它的需要的。例如：
   （三五）早晨我还看见炊烟，午间所见已是火焰。（期）
   （三六）才是对人民最有利的，对国家建设才有帮助。（作）
    （三五）为什么不说“早晨我看见的还是炊烟，午间所见已是火焰”呢？
    （三六）为什么不说“才是对人民最有利，对国家建设最有帮助”呢？这两句的整齐与否还没有多大关系，下面这三句都跟虚字有关，更有调整的需要。
    （三七）这不仅是苏联科学界失掉了一个他们的优秀的领导者，同时也是世界科学界的重大损失。（期）
    （三八）当场派代表去和资本家交涉，要资本家一方面付出停工时的工资，一方面叫他赶快开工。（报）
    （三九）这一下可闯了大祸，除了受贾师父一顿痛打外，经理和工头也起来了，工头随手拿起一把小榔头照头一下，就把他敲昏了。（期）
    （三七）的“不仅是”之后是个句子形式，“同时也是”之后是个短句，这是不均衡的。应该改做“不仅苏联科学界失掉了……，世界科学界也蒙受了一个重大的损失”。（三八）的“要资本家一方面付出”和“一方面叫他（＝资本家）”也是不均衡的。有两种改法：或是把前面改做“一方面要资本家付出”，或是把后面的“叫他”取消。第二个改法较好。（三九）“除了”之后是“他”受人打，再往底下去又是人打“他”，这也是句法不均衡。应该改做“除了贾师父把他痛打一顿外”。
    （四十）而且奖励会启发责任心，对机器设备的爱护加强，使材料工具的损耗率降低，是与生产竞赛相辅为功的。（稿）这一句的“启发……”“对……加强”“使……降低”也是可整齐而不整齐的例子。应该把后两处改做“加强对机器设备的爱护心”和“降低材料工具的损耗率”。
    缺少虚字及类似成分。我们有时候会无意之中叫一个字担任了两个任务，多半是在结构上要重复那个字的时候。例如：
        （四一）纪念会在讲话结束后放映了根据鲁迅遗
            著〔祝福〕改编的越剧祥林嫂而摄制的电影
            祥林嫂。（报）
        （四二）凡是能用效率大的药品一下治好的病，
            决不用效率小的药品慢慢治的办法。（稿）
        （四三）在一小部分地区，还不免有意无意的盗
            掘或破坏的情形发生。（期）照结构上的要求，（四一）应该是“根据（根据鲁迅遗著改篇的）越剧祥林嫂而摄制的电影祥林嫂”，
    （四二）应该是“决不用（用效率小的药品慢慢治的）办法”。“根据根据”和“用用”自然是太不像话，可是如果就此把一个当两个用，叫结构不完全，也不是办法。得另外想法。（四一）可以改做
    “根据鲁迅遗著‘祝福’改编成越剧、又摄成电影的祥林嫂”。（四二）可以去掉“的办法”。（四三）“有意无意”前面应该有个“有”字。这跟前两例不同，是不必顾忌的，因为“有意”是一个词，并不是叠用两个“有”字。倒是“有意无意”用在这里有语病。第一，“有意无意”是“似有意又似无意”的意思，这里该说“有意或无意”；第二，只有“破坏”可能是“有意或无意”，既称为“盗掘”，哪里还能说是“无意”？应该改做“还不免有有意的盗掘或无意的破坏”。“情形”可省，“发生”更可省。
    （四四）西苑一座曾经是北洋军阀的营盘里，川流不息地有知识分子背着沉重的思想包袱进去，换得一腔革命热诚出来。（期）
    （四五）翻译的书有问题，倒并非完全由于译者外文程度不够，也有一些是对于某一种学科的修养欠缺，所以译得有问题的。（期）这两句跟上面三句又不同些。（四四）“曾经是北洋军阀的营盘”的什么呢？缺少一个名词。如果这里只是说“西苑一座营盘”，那么这座营盘就“曾经是北洋军阀”，那是更不通了。应该改做“西苑的曾经做过北洋军阀的营盘的一溜房子里”。（四五）“有一些”什么呢？照意思看，当然是“译者”，但是照结构看，只能是“翻译的书”。应该改做“也有一些是由于译者对于……”。
    句子未完。句子一长，作者往往会忘记前面曾经有过引起性的连接词，下文失去照应，变成有头无尾。这种句子很多，因为没有什么可讨论的，只在这里举一个例，作为坏榜样。
    （四六）因此，虽然中国民族资产阶级由于与买办阶级和封建势力有复杂的联系，由于现在是处于帝国主义与无产阶级革命的时代，因而他们在中国人民革命斗争中成为极其软弱的阶级。（报）
