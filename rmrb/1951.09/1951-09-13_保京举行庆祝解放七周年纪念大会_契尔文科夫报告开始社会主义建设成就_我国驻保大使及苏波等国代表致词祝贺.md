Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 11th. According to TASS, the people of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, held a grand meeting at the People's Theatre on the 8th to celebrate the seventh anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation. The meeting was attended by Bulgarian government and party leaders, advanced industrial and agricultural workers, representatives from the military, scientific, and cultural circles, as well as members of various foreign diplomatic missions. When Chervenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, government leaders, leaders of the Communist Party, the Soviet government delegation headed by Soviet Marshal Sokolovsky, and government delegations from various People's Democratic countries entered the venue, they were warmly welcomed by the audience.

The meeting was presided over by Aikoff, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Chervenkov delivered a report at the meeting. Chervenkov described the role played by the Soviet Union in the liberation and revival of Bulgaria, and pointed out that the Bulgarian people, with the help of the Soviet Union, have begun socialist construction. As early as 1946, Bulgaria's industrial production level reached pre-war levels. This year, the total industrial output will be four times that of 1939. Agriculture is being transformed from a small-scale, scattered economy into a large-scale economy. The welfare of the working people has been improved. These achievements are the result of the people's selfless labor, loyalty to Soviet-Bulgarian friendship, and learning from the Soviet Union's experience, as well as the result of the Soviet Union's valuable and selfless assistance. Chervenkov's report was frequently interrupted by cheers and applause of "Long live Stalin" and "Long live Soviet-Bulgarian friendship."

Marshal Sokolovsky then delivered a speech amidst warm applause. Cao Xiangren, head of the Chinese government delegation and Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria, Zawadzki, head of the Polish government delegation, and representatives of other fraternal countries successively delivered congratulatory speeches.

Finally, with high enthusiasm, the participants passed a telegram of respect to Marshal Stalin.

    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚首都索非亚人民于八日在人民剧院举行庆祝保加利亚解放七周年纪念大会。参加大会的有保加利亚政府和党的领袖，先进的工业和农业劳动者，军队、科学和文化界的代表，以及各国外交使团的人员。保加利亚部长会议主席契尔文科夫和政府领袖、共产党的领袖，以苏联元帅索科洛夫斯基为首的苏联政府代表团，及各人民民主国家政府代表团进入会场时，受到了会众的热烈欢迎。
    大会由保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记爱科夫主持，契尔文科夫在会上作了报告。契尔文科夫叙述了苏联在保加利亚解放和复兴中所起的作用，并指出：保加利亚人民在苏联的帮助下已经开始了社会主义建设。还在一九四六年的时候，保加利亚工业生产水平就达到了战前水平。今年的工业总产量将为一九三九年的四倍。农业正由小规模的、分散的经济变成大规模的经济。劳动人民的福利已经增进。这些成就乃是人民忘我的劳动、忠于保苏友谊和学习苏联的经验的结果，乃是苏联宝贵无私的援助的结果。契尔文科夫的报告频频为“斯大林万岁”、“保苏友谊万岁”的欢呼声与掌声打断。
    索科洛夫斯基元帅接着在热烈掌声中发表演说。中华人民共和国政府代表团团长、中国驻保加利亚大使曹祥仁，波兰政府代表团团长萨瓦德斯基及其他兄弟国家的代表团代表相继致词祝贺。
