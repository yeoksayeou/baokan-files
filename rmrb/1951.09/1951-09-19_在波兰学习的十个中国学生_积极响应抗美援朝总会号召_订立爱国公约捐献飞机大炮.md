    Ten Chinese Students Studying in Poland
    Actively Respond to the Call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association
    Establish a Patriotic Pact and Donate Airplanes and Cannons

    Editor:
    We are ten Chinese students studying in People's Poland. Although we are tens of thousands of miles away from our motherland, we are constantly concerned about our motherland and the great Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement at home. We can now often read the People's Daily and know that our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are fighting side by side, and have achieved great victories and created brilliant deeds in the past few months, and many combat heroes and people's meritorious workers have emerged. At home, workers and farmers have launched enthusiastic patriotic production competitions, and people from all walks of life have established patriotic covenants to support the Korean War of Liberation with practical actions. These facts give us profound education and encouragement. Since going abroad, we have been working hard to study. Because we know that this is the concrete manifestation of our patriotic actions. Since the General Association of Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea issued a call to donate airplanes and cannons and promote patriotic covenants, we actively responded to this call, immediately established a patriotic covenant, and donated 1,336 zlotys (approximately 6.68 million yuan) and a gold ring. In the future, we will continue to donate 2% of our monthly living expenses for the purchase of airplanes and cannons. Finally, we firmly stated that we are ready to respond to any call from the motherland at any time and contribute everything to our great motherland.

    在波兰学习的十个中国学生
    积极响应抗美援朝总会号召
    订立爱国公约捐献飞机大炮编辑同志：
    我们十个人是在人民波兰学习的中国学生。虽然我们远离祖国几万里，但是我们时时刻刻地在关怀着祖国，关怀着国内伟大的抗美援朝爱国运动。我们现在经常可以读到人民日报，知道我们的人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，几个月来已经获得了伟大的胜利，创造了光辉的事迹，出现了无数的战斗英雄与人民功臣。在国内，工人、农民都展开了热烈的爱国主义生产竞赛，各阶层人民纷纷订立爱国公约，以实际行动来支援朝鲜解放战争。这些事实给我们以深刻的教育与鼓舞。出国以来，我们一直是积极努力地学习着。因为我们知道，这就是我们爱国行动的具体表现。自从中国人民抗美援朝总会发出捐献飞机大炮及推行爱国公约的号召后，我们积极响应了这个号召，立即订立了爱国公约，并捐出波兰币一千三百三十六兹罗提（约合人民币六百六十八万余元）及金戒指一只。以后我们还要经常捐献我们每月生活费的百分之二，作为购买飞机大炮之用。最后，我们坚决表示，随时准备响应祖国的任何号召，为我们伟大的祖国贡献一切。
