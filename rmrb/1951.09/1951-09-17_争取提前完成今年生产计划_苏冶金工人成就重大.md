Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Soviet metallurgical workers have achieved significant successes in the socialist competition to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule. According to TASS, thousands of advanced metallurgical workers in northern Ural have already completed their annual production quotas ahead of schedule and are now producing according to the 1952 plan. Since the beginning of July, blast furnace workers at the New Tagil Factory have overproduced several thousand tons of pig iron, saving more than 5,000 tons of iron ore and 2,000 tons of coking coal. The steelworkers at the factory are increasing the amount of cast steel every day. In the first half of this year, they cast more than 2,500 pieces of steel using rapid methods, more than doubling the total for the entire previous year. Tagil blast furnace workers, by more effectively utilizing technical equipment, produced 8.2 percent more pig iron in the first half of this year than originally planned. Blast furnace stokers at Kuznetsk Factory, Siberia's largest metallurgical plant, have overproduced a large amount of metal. Steelworkers in Yenakievo, Donets Basin, have also successfully completed orders for the Volga and Dnieper hydroelectric power stations. In the first half of this year, they shipped many trains of rails and iron blocks a month ahead of schedule.

    Many accomplished metallurgical workers have emerged in the production competition. For example, Stebakin, a blast furnace worker at the Makeyevka Factory in the Stalino Oblast, recently refined 600 tons of pig iron over the plan in one month, achieving a utilization coefficient of 0.8 for the blast furnace volume and saving more than 330,000 rubles. Stalino steelworker Tanchura is victoriously fulfilling his guarantee to produce 1,000 tons of milled iron over the annual plan. Recently, he and his work team have overproduced nearly 3,000 tons of metal. Metallurgical worker Tsisnati of the Zhdanov "Azovstal" steel plant produced 14 tons of steel per square meter of blast furnace surface.

    争取提前完成今年生产计划
    苏冶金工人成就重大
    【新华社十五日讯】苏联冶金工人在争取提前完成今年生产计划的社会主义竞赛中，已获得了重大的成就。据塔斯社消息：乌拉尔北部已有数千先进冶金工人提前完成了一年的生产定额，现在正依照一九五二年的计划生产着。新塔吉尔工厂鼓风炉工人从七月初以来，已超过计划生产了好几千吨的生铁，节省了五千多吨铁矿砂和两千吨焦煤。该厂的炼钢工人们每天都在增加铸钢的数量，今年上半年他们用快速方法铸造了二千五百多件钢，比去年全年增加了一倍半。塔吉尔鼓风炉工人们由于更有效地利用技术装备，今年上半年所出产的生铁比原订计划增加了百分之八点二。西伯利亚最大的冶金工厂——库兹涅茨克工厂的鼓风炉司炉，已超过计划生产了大量的金属。顿尼兹盆地叶那基佛的钢铁工人们也胜利地完成了伏尔加河和第聂伯河水电站的定货，今年上半年他们就提前一个月运出了许多列车的铁轨和铁块。
    在生产竞赛中已经涌现了许多成绩卓著的冶金工人。例如，斯大林诺州马基耶夫卡工厂的鼓风炉工人斯捷巴金，最近在一个月内超计划炼了六百吨生铁，使鼓风炉容积的使用系数达到了零点八，并节省了三十三万多卢布。斯大林诺钢铁工人坦楚拉正在胜利地执行着超过全年计划生产一千吨铣铁的保证，最近他和他的工作队已超额生产了将近三千吨金属。日丹诺夫“亚速”炼钢厂的冶金工人齐斯纳提在每一平方公尺的鼓风炉炉面上生产了十四吨钢。
