Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st—The Japan National Peace Congress, held in mid-August, passed a resolution made by the Standing Committee of the Japan Peace Supporters Committee on August 3, opposing the signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan at the San Francisco Conference. The resolution, representing the Japanese people, opposes the US-drafted peace treaty, opposes the Yoshida Cabinet signing this treaty, and declares that even if this treaty is formally signed, the Japanese people will not recognize its validity. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

We have made the following resolutions regarding the temporary signing of a peace treaty in San Francisco in early September:

(1) We oppose the US-drafted peace treaty and the US-Japan Security Treaty. Because:

	A. China, which suffered the most from Japanese militarism and has close ties with the lives of the Japanese people, is excluded. Failure to clearly state that Taiwan will be returned to China violates the Cairo Declaration.

	B. The stationing of foreign troops in Japan after the treaty is concluded, giving them many rights, privileges, and conveniences, will cause Japan to lose its autonomy and independence.

	C. Re-arming Japan to assist the "United Nations" and collective security guarantees threatens world peace.

	D. Separating Amami Oshima, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which have belonged to Japanese territory since ancient times, from Japan violates the Cairo Declaration.

	E. The peace treaty with Japan is neither convening a meeting of the four major powers (US, UK, Soviet Union, China) nor convening a meeting of all countries that participated in the war against Japan by force. Signing only by governments that approve the US-drafted plan will deepen international confrontation and increase the risk of war.

	F. The above provisions of the draft violate the Potsdam Proclamation, the Potsdam Agreement, and other international agreements during the war.

(2) We oppose the Yoshida Cabinet signing a treaty that the people do not understand, and oppose Prime Minister Yoshida serving as Plenipotentiary Representative.

	A. The Yoshida Cabinet was established in January 1949. The peace treaty issue was not discussed during that election. Therefore, the current cabinet does not even formally represent the people's opinion on the peace treaty.

	B. The policies of issuing orders to lift the purge of war criminals, establishing a police reserve force, and encouraging military industry, etc., show that the Yoshida Cabinet is not a peaceful cabinet in essence, but a cabinet with militaristic tendencies.

	C. It is rumored that the US-Japan Security Treaty has a secret agreement attached to it. This kind of military secret agreement violates the spirit of the constitution and disregards the will of the people.

(3) A separate peace and military agreement disregard the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements, violate the Japanese Constitution, infringe upon Japan's independence and autonomy, and threaten world peace. Therefore, it is legally and politically invalid. Even if it is formally signed, its validity cannot be recognized.

(4) We demand that the four major powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China convene a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the draft peace treaty with Japan, and that a peace conference be held by representatives of all countries participating in the war against Japan.

We oppose the rearmament of Japan and demand the conclusion of a just treaty that guarantees Japan's independence.

    日本全国和平大会通过决议
    反对单独媾和及美日军事协定
    日本人民要求缔结保障独立的公正和约
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：八月中旬举行的日本全国和平大会，通过了日本拥护和平委员会常设委员会八月三日作出的关于反对旧金山会议签订单独对日和约的决议。决议代表日本人民，反对美制和约草案，反对吉田内阁在这个和约上签字，并宣布这个和约即使在形式上签字了，日本人民也不承认它有效。决议全文如下：
    我们对定于九月初旬在旧金山临时签订和约，作了以下的决议：
    （一）我们反对美制和约草案及美日安全保障协定。因为：
    甲、遭受日本军国主义的灾害最大而且和日本人民的生活有密切关系的中国被排斥在外。不明确指出台湾归还中国，是违反开罗宣言的。
    乙、缔约后外国军队驻扎在日本，给它许多权利、特权、方便，是使日本丧失自主独立。
    丙、为了协助“联合国”和集体安全保障，重新武装日本，就是威胁世界和平。
    丁、从日本割离自古以来就属于日本领土的奄美大岛和琉球群岛、小笠原群岛是违反开罗宣言的。
    戊、对日媾和，既不召开美、英、苏、中四大国会议，也不召开以武力参加对日作战的全体国家的会议，仅由赞成美制草案的政府签字，这是加深国际间的对立，增加战争的危机。
    己、以上草案各项规定是违反波茨坦公告、波茨坦协定及其他战时的各项国际协定的。
    （二）我们反对吉田内阁签订国民不明白的和约，反对吉田首相担任全权代表。
    甲、吉田内阁成立于一九四九年一月，那次大选时，并没有讨论媾和问题。所以现任内阁就是在形式上也不是代表国民对媾和的意见的。
    乙、发布解除战争责任者的整肃的命令，设置警察后备队，奖励军需工业等政策，说明吉田内阁在实质上也不是和平的内阁，而是有军国主义倾向的内阁。
    丙、传闻美日安全保障协定附带有秘密协定。这种军事秘密协定是违反宪法精神，漠视国民意志的。
    （三）单独媾和及军事协定无视波茨坦公告及其他各项国际协定，违反日本宪法，侵害日本的独立与自主，威胁世界和平。所以，在法律上、在政治上都是无效的。即使在形式上签了字，也不能承认其有效。
    （四）我们要求美、英、苏、中四大国召开外长会议，商讨对日和约草案，并由所有参加对日作战的国家的代表举行和会。
    我们反对重新武装日本，要求缔结保障日本独立的公正和约。
