    I. How was the Wired Broadcasting Station of Shenyang Factory 52 established?
    The wired broadcasting station (they call it a broadcasting station) of Shenyang Factory 52 has become an indispensable part of the political and cultural life of the factory's employees. Many employees feel like something is missing if they don't listen to the broadcast for a day. When they encounter problems they can't figure out, they immediately raise them with the broadcasting station. The broadcasting station has truly become a powerful assistant for conducting current affairs education, promoting production, assisting learning, and carrying out cultural entertainment. At the end of last year, the factory's broadcasting station won the "First-Class Broadcasting Station" award in the annual awards of Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station.
    However, the broadcasting station of Factory 52 had taken a detour. In July 1949, in order to conduct propaganda and education for employees, the factory bought a 200-watt amplifier and 42 large loudspeakers, which were installed in various workshops and collective dormitories for workers. The wired broadcasting station was thus established. Sometimes they broadcast production information, sometimes they reported on the achievements of creating new records, and sometimes they rebroadcast the "Workers' Program" of Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station. At the beginning of the work, the workers felt novel and were willing to listen. But slowly, everyone stopped listening, and some workers even disliked the broadcast in order to go to bed early or do other things. Some even suggested simply canceling the loudspeakers.
    Later, two comrades from Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station were sent to the factory to help with the work of the broadcasting station. They and the factory's trade union's culture and education committee jointly studied the reasons for the failure of the work and found that there were many shortcomings in the factory's broadcasting work: the organizational leadership was not sound enough, the work lacked planning and organization, there were no fixed listening organizations, the existing listening organizations lacked contact with the workers, the broadcast content was disorganized, the broadcasting was unsystematic, sometimes long and sometimes short, sometimes broadcasting and sometimes stopping, and the "Workers' Program" of the People's Broadcasting Station could not well meet the needs of the majority of employees.
    Having identified these problems, they formulated a plan to improve the work, which mainly included the following three items: improving the organizational structure, formulating programs according to the needs of the employees and organizing listening, and establishing a working system.
    In order to improve the organizational structure, it was stipulated that all daily work of the broadcasting station would be led by the factory's culture and education committee, and the broadcasting business would be guided by Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station. The broadcasting station was to have a director and a deputy director, with the director concurrently serving as the chairman of the factory's trade union and the deputy director concurrently serving as the culture and education officer of the culture and education committee, so that the management of the broadcasting station would be unified with the factory's communication organization and blackboard newspapers, and it would be convenient for mutual coordination.
    The new organization, under the director and deputy director, has four groups:
    Editorial Group: The main tasks are: 1. Responsible for processing the broadcast manuscripts required daily; 2. Arranging various programs for daily rebroadcasts and self-broadcasts; 3. Determining the weekly broadcast program plan (the overall plan is made by the director); 4. Writing literary manuscripts reporting on domestic and international current affairs and introducing the factory's advanced production experience, and handing them over to the entertainment group for performance; 5. Publishing the "Today's Broadcast" express newspaper when necessary to announce important programs.
    Technical and Broadcasting Group: The main tasks are: 1. Assembly and repair of all machines; 2. Responsible for all technical operations during broadcasting time; 3. Announcers are responsible for broadcasting all manuscripts.
    Entertainment Group: The main tasks are: 1. Responsible for performing the entertainment programs required by the broadcasting station, including the entertainment manuscripts submitted by various workshops; 2. Organizing the performance of the band, choir, and drama group; 3. Organizing the culture and education committee members of various workshops, mobilizing them to organize entertainment programs, and broadcasting them in rotation; 4. Selecting excellent entertainment programs for Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station.
    Listening Group: The main tasks are: 1. Leading and developing the factory's listening groups; 2. Collecting and organizing the opinions of listening groups and listeners on the broadcast; 3. Formulating the registration, meeting, and reporting system for listening groups, and supervising and inspecting their implementation; 4. Responsible for maintaining regular contact with Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station, reflecting opinions, and exchanging experiences.
    Each group has one to two group leaders and several staff members. The organizational system is as follows: Director Deputy Director Editorial Group: 1 group leader, 3 staff members Technical and Broadcasting Group: 1 group leader and 1 deputy group leader, 5 staff members Entertainment Group: 1 group leader and 1 deputy group leader, 9 staff members. Listening Group: 1 group leader and 1 deputy group leader, 3 staff members. They lead 53 listening groups respectively.
    Secondly, investigate and understand the needs of the majority of employees and start organizing listening. They adopted the method of casual visits, starting with the single dormitories of the employees. After all the personnel were assigned, they started working together. Each person visited several rooms every day, asking the workers for their opinions on the past broadcasts and how to improve them in the future, and incidentally told them about the future practices. In the conversation, they found many activists and expanded the publicity through them. These people became the backbone of the listening groups in the future. After investigation and explanation, the original opinions and dissatisfaction with the broadcast began to change. The vast majority of workers welcomed listening to the broadcast, and they put forward many valuable suggestions. Many people requested more broadcasts of literary and artistic programs, and requested systematic and planned broadcasts of political common sense and technical knowledge.
    Thirdly, they stipulated some necessary working rules and systems. They formulated their own broadcast program schedule:
    17:55 Starting music;
    18:00 - Rebroadcast of Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station's "Workers' Program";
    19:00 - Factory Communications; Current Affairs News;
    19:15 - Various Lectures;
    19:30 - Entertainment Programs (self-broadcast or rebroadcast);
    20:00 - Ending music.
    After the preparations were completed, the factory's CPC Party Committee, trade union, and Youth League convened a joint meeting of the culture and education committee members of various workshops, the propaganda committee members of the Youth League branches, and the broadcasting correspondents of the radio station, calling on everyone to run the factory's broadcasting station well. In this way, extensive publicity was launched throughout the factory. News was published on the blackboard newspapers of various workshops. The factory's large blackboard newspaper also published a special issue, so that the workers had a clearer understanding of the broadcast. On this basis, listening groups began to be established. Three were established in the first week, and now it has developed to 53, with a total of 180 listeners and nearly 1,000 listeners.
    After this reform of the broadcasting station, its broadcasting was welcomed by the majority of employees in the factory. They also added "Our Station Speaks," giving sincere answers to the suggestions and criticisms raised by the workers. According to everyone's opinions, the broadcast became more and more suitable for the tastes and needs of the workers. With the development of the broadcasting station's work, the leadership also paid more attention to using the broadcasting station. In October last year, in conjunction with the patriotic labor competition to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the factory leaders put forward three specific guidelines for the broadcasting station: 1. Face production and encourage the enthusiasm for production competition; 2. Conduct political education in conjunction with current affairs propaganda; 3. Appropriately regulate the workers' spare-time cultural life. According to these guidelines, each group formulated specific plans and steps, strengthened the meeting and reporting system, and the broadcasting station's work took another leap forward. II. How to push the work further?
    The reason why the broadcasting station of Shenyang Factory 52 can consolidate the factory's broadcast listening work and push it forward is that, in addition to the above-mentioned points, they have gradually grasped some tricks and accumulated some experience:
    First, they organized a large number of correspondents to write manuscripts for the broadcasting station, and planned and focused on interviewing the production situation of various workshops, thus effectively promoting the upsurge of labor competition in the factory. For example, after broadcasting the conditions put forward by the first workshop of the inspection section to "guarantee that the work of the day is completed on the same day," the workers actively responded. The female worker Yang Lizhen and others even tried to do without the one-hour breastfeeding time allowed by the administration. After this incident was broadcast, everyone was even happier. The workshop chairman also called on the conference: "The broadcasting station has told everyone about our affairs, we must maintain our glory!" Therefore, they often put forward rationalization proposals such as allocating manpower and insisted on the slogan "How much the workshop does, how much is inspected." In addition, they often invited factory department directors, workshop chairmen, production committee members, technicians, old workers, etc. to broadcast. The workers were very interested in their own people talking about their own affairs. Sometimes, grasping certain facts and making well-intentioned criticisms of certain workers in the broadcast also had a great effect. For example, after they broadcast that the worker Guan Chenglun was only concerned with speed in production and produced defective products, Guan Chenglun felt ashamed and determined to correct his mistakes. He immediately made a review, guaranteeing 100% in quality, and the output also increased by 50% compared to before.
    Second, they enthusiastically serve the employees, listen to everyone's opinions very well, and constantly improve the broadcast content according to the opinions of the masses. They can answer the questions raised by the audience in a timely manner. As some workers said:
    "The broadcasting station and the radio station are like good friends to us. We can get an answer just by picking up the microphone like making a phone call." Therefore, the broadcasting station has a high prestige among the masses. Recently, in order to meet the needs of the employees, they held four lectures: one is "Workers' Lecture," which is responsible by the trade union, and the content is to talk about how to carry out cultural, educational, production, labor protection, women's and other work in conjunction with the activities of the factory. The second is "Youth Lecture," which is responsible by the Youth League, and the content is to talk about the stories of the Chinese revolution and discuss some practical problems of young workers. The third is "Hygiene Lecture," which is responsible by the hygiene section. The fourth is "Safety Lecture," which is responsible by the security section, the public security bureau, and the technical safety section. The content is to talk about the factory's four-prevention work and the work of machines, bodies, security, etc.
    Third, they maintain close contact with Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station and often collect and reflect the opinions of the audience. They rebroadcast the "Workers' Program" of the People's Broadcasting Station every day and report the situation to the People's Broadcasting Station every week. In the past, they used to focus their main efforts on broadcasting within the factory and neglected rebroadcasting the Shenyang Station's workers' program. Later, they realized that doing so would not allow them to understand the production situation of other factories in a timely manner, and it would not be easy to learn from others. Especially in the patriotic competition, the majority of employees not only demanded to understand the city's production situation in a timely manner, but also wanted to listen to the People's Broadcasting Station's systematic current affairs broadcast. Therefore, they also regarded the Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station's workers' broadcast program as their own program.
    Fourth, they established a relatively complete listening organization, grasped the listening work relatively tightly, and planned and consciously cultivated a group of active listeners of the broadcast. These backbones also became propagandists for spreading the broadcast. For example, the listening staff member Ma Zuoshan, who is the organization committee member of the workshop, often listens to the broadcast carefully. After listening, he takes the initiative to tell others. Over time, it becomes a habit. If a worker does not hear the broadcast due to something, he automatically asks him to tell him. The reporting system of their listening group was very rigid at the beginning. They urged to hold meetings whenever they were free, but the results were not great. Later, they changed to the method of visiting to hold meetings, collect opinions, and communicate, which solved the difficulty of "fear of meetings," and opinions were easily communicated in a timely manner.
    Fifth, their broadcasting work is better coordinated with other mass work in the factory. This is partly due to the unified organizational structure, and also because the personnel of the broadcasting station did think of some ways on their own initiative. For example, for some important broadcast manuscripts, they not only broadcast them, but also published them on the blackboard newspaper. During the weekly movie screenings, they started broadcasting during the break, telling everyone some short and interesting things, which played a certain role. They often pay attention to the broadcast of literary and artistic programs to match the cultural life of the employees. For example, the cross-talk about Truman slapping his mouth made the workers know that Truman's previous and subsequent statements were contradictory. Many fast-clappers have been learned by the majority of workers after several broadcasts, which not only regulated the cultural life of the employees, but also carried out good political education.

    一个典型的工厂有线广播台
    左荧
    一、沈阳五二厂的广播台是怎样搞起来的？
    沈阳五二厂的有线广播台（他们自己称做广播站）已经成了该厂职工政治文化生活中不可缺少的一部分。许多职工一天不听广播就像缺点什么似的。碰到什么问题弄不通的时候，也就马上向广播台提了出来。广播台真正成了他们进行时事教育、推动生产、辅助学习和开展文化娱乐的有力助手。去年底，沈阳人民广播电台年终评奖时，该厂广播台又获得“一等广播站”的奖励。
    但是，五二厂广播台是曾经走过一段弯路的。一九四九年七月，该厂为了对职工进行宣传教育，就买了一台二百瓦特的扩大器和四十二个大型的喇叭，装在各个车间和工友的集体宿舍里。有线广播台就这样建立了起来。有时广播些生产情况，有时也报告些创造新纪录的事迹，有时也转播一下沈阳人民广播电台的“职工节目”。工作刚开始时，工友们感到新奇，也愿收听。但是慢慢地大家不大收听了，甚至有个别工友为了早睡觉或做别的事，还讨厌广播。有人还提议干脆取消喇叭。
    后来，沈阳人民广播电台派了两个同志到该厂帮助搞广播台工作。他们和该厂工会文教委员会一同研究工作失败的原因，发现工厂广播工作有许多缺点：组织领导还不够健全，工作缺乏计划性和组织性，没有固定的收听组织，已有的收听组织同工友缺乏联系，广播内容杂乱，播音没有制度，时长时短，时播时停，人民广播电台的“职工节目”，也不能很好地满足广大职工的需要。
    摸到了这些毛病，他们就订了改进工作的计划，主要包括如下三项，就是健全组织机构，根据职工需要拟订节目和组织收听，建立工作制度。
    为着健全组织机构，规定广播台的一切日常工作归该厂文教委员会领导，广播业务则受沈阳人民广播电台的指导。广播台设主任和副主任各一人，主任由该厂工会主席兼，副主任由文教委员会文教干事兼，这样广播台的管理，便和全厂的通讯组织以及黑板报等统一起来，相互间也便于配合。
    新的组织，在正副主任下面，设四个组：
    编辑组：主要工作是：一、负责处理每日所需要的广播稿件；二、编排每日转播和自播的各种节目；三、确定每周广播节目计划（全台计划由主任做）；四、编写报道国内外时事和介绍本厂先进生产经验的文艺稿件，交文娱组演出；五、必要时出版“今日广播”快报，预告重要节目。
    机务播音组：主要工作：一、全部机器的装配与修理；二、负责播音时间内机务方面的一切操作；三、播音员负责播送一切稿件。
    文娱组：主要工作：一、负责演播广播台所需的文娱节目，包括各车间交来的文娱稿件；二、组织乐队、歌咏队和戏剧组的演播；三、组织各车间文教委员，发动他们组织文娱节目，轮流播出；四、选择精彩文娱节目供给沈阳人民广播电台。
    收听组：主要工作：一、领导与发展全厂收听小组；二、搜集整理收听小组与听众对广播的意见；三、制订收听小组的登记、会议、汇报等制度，并督促检查其执行；四、负责与沈阳人民广播电台经常保持联系，反映意见，交流经验。
    每组各设组长一至二人，干事若干人。其组织系统表如下：主任副主任编辑组：组长一人，干事三人机务播音组：正副组长各一人，干事五人文娱组：正副组长各一人，干事九人。收听组：正副组长各一人，干事三人。分别领导五十三个收听小组。
    其次，调查了解广大职工的需要，开始组织收听。他们采取串门闲谈的方式，首先从职工独身宿舍入手。全部人员分工以后，一齐动手。每人每天串几间房子，问问工友们对过去广播的意见和以后怎样才能搞得好，顺便就把今后的做法告诉了他们。在谈话中，发现了不少积极分子，便通过他们扩大了宣传，这些人就成为以后收听小组的骨干。经过调查与解释，原来对广播有意见和不满意的，对广播的看法也开始转变了。绝大多数工友是欢迎收听广播的，他们提了许多宝贵的意见。很多人要求多播文艺节目，要求有系统地有计划地广播些政治常识和技术知识。
    再其次，他们规定了一些必要的工作细则和制度。制定了自己的播音节目时间表：
    十七点五十五分开始曲；
    十八点——转播沈阳人民广播电台“职工节目”；
    十九点——本厂通讯；时事新闻；
    十九点十五分——各种讲座；
    十九点三十分——文娱节目（自播或转播）；
    二十点——终了曲。
    准备工作告一段落之后，就由厂里的中共党委会、工会、青年团召集各车间文教委员、团支部宣教委员、电台的广播通讯员开了个联席会，号召大家办好工厂广播台。就这样在全厂展开了广泛宣传。各车间黑板报上都登出了消息。厂部大黑板报并且出了专刊，使工友对广播有了比较明确的认识。在这个基础上，收听小组开始建立起来，头一周成立了三个，现在已经发展到了五十三个，总计收音员一百八十名，听众近千名。
    广播台经过这次的改革，它的播音就受到了厂内广大职工的欢迎。他们又增加了“本站讲话”，对工友们提出的建议和批评，都作了诚恳的回答。根据大家的意见，广播也一天天适合工友们的口味与需要。随着广播台工作的开展，领导上也更重视运用广播台了。去年十月，结合抗美援朝爱国主义劳动竞赛，工厂领导同志对广播台提出了三项具体方针：一、面向生产，鼓舞生产竞赛的热情；二、结合时事宣传进行政治教育；三、适当地调剂工友的业余文化生活。根据这些方针，各组订出了具体计划和步骤，加强了会议与汇报制度，广播台工作又向前跃进了一步。二、怎样将工作推进一步？
    沈阳五二厂广播台所以能将工厂广播收听工作巩固下来并且把它向前推进了一步，除了前面所述几点之外，还由于他们逐渐摸到了一些窍门，积累了一些经验：
    第一、他们组织了广大通讯员给广播台写稿，有计划地有重点地采访了各车间的生产情况，因而有力地推动了全厂的劳动竞赛热潮。比如广播了检验科第一车间提出来的“保证当天的活儿当天完”的条件以后，工友们就积极响应，女工杨立珍等甚至把行政上准许的一小时喂奶时间也想办法不要了。这件事广播过后，大家更高兴了。车间主席又在大会上号召：“广播站都把咱们的事告诉了大家，咱们得保持光荣啊！”所以他们经常提出调配人力等合理化建议，坚持了“车间干多少就检验多少”的口号。此外，他们还经常请厂里部主任、车间主席、生产委员、技术人员、老工友等来广播。工友们对自己的人讲自己的事很感兴趣。有时掌握一定的事实，在广播里对某些工友提出善意的批评，也发生很大作用。比如他们广播了工友关成伦在生产上光图快，出废活的事情，关成伦听到后，感到很惭愧，决心纠正错误，马上作了检讨，在质量上保证百分之百，产量也比以前增多了百分之五十。
    第二、他们热心为职工服务，很好地倾听大家的意见，根据群众的意见不断改进广播内容。他们对听众提出的问题都能及时答复，正像有些工友说：
    “广播站和电台对我们真像好朋友一样，我们提出意见，就能像打电话一样拿起话筒就可以得到回答。”因此，广播台在群众中有了很高的威信。最近他们为满足职工的要求，举办了四个讲座：一是“职工讲座”，由工会负责，内容是结合本厂活动来讲如何进行文教、生产、劳保、妇女等工作。二是“青年讲座”，由青年团负责，内容是讲些中国革命的故事，讨论青年工人的一些切身问题等。三是“卫生讲座”，由卫生科负责。四是“安全讲座”，由保卫科、公安局、技术安全科负责，内容是讲工厂的四防工作和机器、身体、保安等方面工作。
    第三、他们和沈阳人民广播电台保持很密切的联系，经常搜集并反映听众的意见。他们每天转播人民电台的“职工节目”，每周向人民电台汇报情况。过去他们曾经把主要力量放在厂内广播而忽略了转播沈阳台职工节目。后来认识到，这样做了就不能及时了解其他厂的生产情况，不容易向别人学习，特别在爱国主义竞赛中，广大职工不仅要求及时了解全市的生产情况，而且要听人民电台有系统的时事广播。因此，他们也就把沈阳人民广播电台的职工广播节目当作自己的节目来看待。
    第四、他们建立了一套比较完整的收音组织，对收听工作抓得比较紧，有计划地有意识地培养了一批收听广播的积极分子。这些骨干同时就成了传布广播的宣传员。比如收听干事马作山，他是车间组织委员，由于他经常细心收听广播，听完以后又主动说给别人听，时间长了就成了习惯，如果那个工友因事没有听到广播，就自动找他给讲。他们收听小组的汇报制度，开头订得很死板，一有空就催着开会，结果收获不大，后来改用串门的办法来开会，收集意见和传达，就解决了“怕开会”的困难，意见也容易及时沟通了。
    第五、他们的广播工作同厂内其他群众工作配合得比较好。这一方面是由于组织机构统一，另方面也因为广播台的人员确实主动地想了些办法。比如有些重要广播稿，他们不仅广播，而且登在黑板报上。在每周演电影的时候，中间一休息他们就开始广播，挑些简短有趣的事告诉大家，起了一定作用。他们经常注意广播文艺节目配合职工文化生活。比如用相声说杜鲁门打嘴巴，工友们听后便知道了杜鲁门的前后声明发生了矛盾。很多快板经过几次广播，广大工友已经学会了，这就不仅调剂了职工文化生活，而且进行了很好的政治教育。
