Party Life Commentary

    Oppose Interference in Freedom of Marriage

    The illegal and undisciplined incident of Tang Zhigao, the District Chief of the Sixth District of Lincheng County, Shandong Province, and member of the Lincheng Sixth District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong, interfering in the freedom of marriage and arbitrarily detaining people, shows that among some of our Party member cadres, there are still remnants of feudal ideas on the issue of marriage, which seriously hinders the implementation of the Marriage Law.

    Tang Zhigao, as the District Chief of Lincheng Sixth District and a Communist Party member, actually used his position and power in his work to prevent the widow Yang from marrying Zhang Xueshan, forced Yang to marry the cook of the district office, and detained Zhang Xueshan as a counter-revolutionary. This illegal behavior fully demonstrates Tang Zhigao's feudal privilege mentality. After the superior Party committee discovered his mistake and sent people to investigate and deal with it, Tang Zhigao did not honestly admit his mistake and correct it, but instead systematically deceived and concealed the Party, and insisted on his mistake. Only when it was impossible to conceal it any longer did Tang Zhigao vaguely admit that he had made a mistake.

    Tang Zhigao's mistake has developed to the point of blatantly abusing his power to interfere in the freedom of marriage and undermine the Marriage Law. This is absolutely not allowed by Party discipline and the law. It is entirely necessary for the local Party committee and government to give Tang Zhigao disciplinary action.

    Facts in various places prove that to correctly implement the Marriage Law, it is necessary to first conduct thorough education within the Party, correct the residual feudal ideas among some Party members, and resolutely struggle against the behavior of Party member cadres who violate the Marriage Law. Communist Party members must lead by example, lead the masses to actively ensure the correct implementation of the Marriage Law, struggle against all erroneous ideas, and ruthlessly expose and criticize all erroneous actions that interfere with the freedom of marriage and undermine the Marriage Law.

    党的生活简评
    反对干涉婚姻自由
    山东临城县六区区长、中共山东临城六区区委委员汤志高干涉婚姻自由并任意扣人的违法乱纪事件，说明了在我们一部分党员干部中，在婚姻问题上，还存在着残余的封建思想，严重地在阻碍着婚姻法的贯彻。
    汤志高身为临城六区区长，又是共产党员，竟在工作中利用自己的职权，不许寡妇杨氏与张学善结婚，强迫杨氏与区公所的炊事员结婚，并将张学善当作反革命分子加以扣押。这种违法行为，充分地表现出汤志高的封建特权思想。当上级党委发现他的这种错误后，派人去检查处理，汤志高不是老老实实承认错误，改正错误，却是对党有计划地实行欺骗隐瞒，坚持错误。到无可掩饰时，汤志高才笼统地承认自己有错误。
    汤志高的错误已经发展到明目张胆地滥用职权干涉婚姻自由，破坏婚姻法。这是党纪和法纪所绝对不能容许的。当地党委和政府给汤志高以纪律处分是完全必要的。
    各地事实证明，正确贯彻婚姻法，必须首先在党内进行充分的教育，纠正某些党员中残留的封建思想，坚决同党员干部违犯婚姻法行为进行坚决的斗争。共产党员必须以身作则，带领群众积极地保证婚姻法正确执行，同一切错误思想进行斗争，无情地揭发和批判一切干涉婚姻自由，破坏婚姻法的错误行动。
