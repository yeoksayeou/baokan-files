Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: General Secretary Pollitt of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to congratulate the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The telegram is as follows:

Beijing, Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Dear Comrades:

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we extend our warm and fraternal congratulations to you with great pride and joy. The glorious victory of October 1, 1949, is not only a joyous festival for the Chinese people, it has given new strength and inspiration to the countless billions of people around the world who are striving for national and colonial liberation, and has strengthened the power of the working-class movement in various imperialist countries.

We are watching with increasing admiration and enthusiasm the inspiring achievements made by your government and people in building a new China in industry and agriculture, the amazing progress in education and culture, and the high degree of confidence shown. We are convinced that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will continue to move forward and achieve greater and greater achievements.

Your victory has inflicted heavy losses on the imperialist aggressors, but they are desperately struggling to restore their position by launching a criminal war of aggression against the Korean people, provoking the People's Republic of China, and their so-called peace treaty with Japan—which is, in fact, aimed at turning Japan into a war base against the Soviet Union and the Chinese people.

The record of the continuous undermining of the Korean peace talks by US imperialism shows that their aim is to expand the war and drag Britain and other countries into a new world catastrophe.

The British government's support for the US war of aggression against Korea and its signing of the so-called peace treaty with Japan, thereby imposing a deadly arms expansion burden on the British people that savagely violates their living standards, is an eternal shame for the British government. The heads of the Conservative Party and the right-wing Labor Party, with their support for the American war plan, threaten trade between our two countries, encourage Japan as a low-wage labor competitor, and seriously damage the British economy.

We are convinced that the peace-loving people of the world will eventually defeat the war plans of the imperialists. Under the leadership of the great Soviet Union, and inspired by the great achievements of the new China and the people's democracies of Eastern Europe, they will intensify their efforts to fight for the liberation of Korea and world peace.

While extending our fraternal congratulations to you, we pledge to fight with all our strength to forge a stronger friendship between our two peoples and to cooperate with all peace-loving people to prevent a new world war.

Long live the peace and friendship between the British and Chinese people!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people!

With fraternal greetings!

    英国共产党执行委员会总书记
    波立特电中共中央祝贺我国庆
    加拿大劳工进步党和英中友协亦来电致贺
    【新华社二十八日讯】英国共产党执行委员会总书记波立特致电中国共产党中央委员会祝贺中华人民共和国成立二周年。电文如下：北京中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    欣逢中华人民共和国成立二周年纪念，我们怀着莫大的自豪和喜悦，向你们致以热烈的、兄弟的祝贺。一九四九年十月一日的辉煌胜利，不仅是中国人民的欢欣的节日，它给予了正在争取民族和殖民地底解放的全世界无数亿万人民以新的力量和鼓舞，并加强了各帝国主义国家工人阶级运动的威力。
    我们怀着日益增长的钦佩和热诚，注视着贵国政府和人民在建设新中国中所取得的工、农业方面振奋人心的成就，教育和文化方面可惊的进步以及所表现的高度的信心。我们深信，在中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志底领导下，中国人民将继续向前，取得愈来愈大的成就。
    你们的胜利使帝国主义侵略者遭受到惨重的失败，但他们正在绝望地挣扎，企图以进攻朝鲜人民的罪恶战争，对中华人民共和国的挑衅行为以及他们的所谓对日和约——事实上乃旨在将日本变成反对苏联和中国人民的战争基地——来恢复他们的地位。
    美帝国主义不断地破坏朝鲜和平谈判的记录显示，他们的目的是要扩大战争，并将不列颠和其他国家卷进一次世界的新浩劫。
    不列颠政府支持了美国侵略朝鲜的战争，签署了所谓对日和约，并因而将野蛮地侵犯人民生活标准的、致命的扩军负担强加在不列颠人民的头上，这是不列颠政府底永恒的耻辱。保守党和右翼工党的头子们以其对美国战争计划的支持，威胁了贵我两国间的贸易，怂恿了作为低价劳动竞争者的日本并严重地损害了不列颠的经济。
    我们深信，全世界爱好和平的人民终将击败帝国主义者的战争计划。在伟大苏联的领导下，在新中国和东欧人民民主国家底巨大成就的鼓舞下，他们将加紧努力，以争取朝鲜的解放和世界和平。
    和向你们致兄弟的祝贺的同时，我们谨宣誓，用我们的全部力量进行斗争，以缔造贵我两国人民更加强大的友谊以及和一切爱好和平的人民合作，防止新的世界战争。
    不列颠人民和中国人民的和平与友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
        谨致兄弟的敬礼！
                    英国共产党执行委员会总书记：波立特
