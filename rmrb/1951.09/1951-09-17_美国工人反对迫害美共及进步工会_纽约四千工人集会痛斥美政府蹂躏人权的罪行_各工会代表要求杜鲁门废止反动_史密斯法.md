Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: New York dispatch: The American authorities' fascist "Smith Act"-based persecution of Communist and non-Communist labor leaders through mass arrests has been met with growing resistance from American workers.

More than four thousand workers in New York held a mass rally on the evening of the 10th, denouncing the Truman government's actions as violations of the Constitution and trampling on human rights, and calling on everyone to carry out the broadest possible movement to defend the people's democratic rights. Hood, secretary of the Michigan branch of the United Automobile Workers Union, warned at the meeting that America's quasi-fascist forces were already knocking on the "door" of the entire labor movement. He called on everyone to work to rescue the arrested Communist leaders. He said, "We must mobilize to resist this evil force." The famous Black peace activist Paul Robeson pointed out in his speech that he had found that all the workers were prepared to fight the reactionary "Smith Act" when traveling across the United States. Robeson said that workers should know what power they have and must show that power. The conference finally passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the fascist "Smith Act."

Progressive unions that have been directly persecuted by the "Smith Act" have expressed the greatest indignation at the fascist conspiracy of the US government. Emspak, General Secretary of the independent United Electrical Workers Union, and Matles, the organization's director, were summoned, and Fitzgerald, the union's president, issued a statement on the 11th, denouncing the government's move as an "anti-union movement."

The New York Daily Worker pointed out that the firm anti-fascist performance of the American workers "shows the country that there is a force here that can save the United States from McCarthyism and growing fascism." These forces that save American democracy and freedom exist first and foremost in the labor movement and trade unions, and these two forces must converge. [Xinhua News Agency, September 16th] TASS News Agency, New York, September 15th: According to the "Daily Worker" San Francisco, 175 representatives, representing 30,000 union workers from the American Federation of Labor (AFL), the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and some independent unions, attended the "Northern California Joint Union Action Committee" meeting. The meeting condemned the arrest of progressives based on the notorious "Smith Act" and demanded that Truman immediately abolish the law.

The meeting also decided to launch a movement throughout the country to abolish all so-called "security" and "loyalty" programs and other blacklisting tactics. The meeting was convened because unionists were increasingly uneasy about the blacklisting of active longshore union leaders in Northern California and other West Coast ports.

Barke, Vice President of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, emphasized that the blacklist involved a wide range within his union and warned that if workers did not actively rise up in resistance, this measure would spread to other unions.

Marshall, the official representative of the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, similarly condemned the blacklist and emphasized that his union actively supported the abolition of all anti-labor measures.

A "Daily Worker" reporter pointed out that even some conservative labor leaders are becoming increasingly uneasy about the increasing fascist oppression of trade unions. The "Daily Worker" reporter emphasized the speech made by CIO Vice President and Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union Treasurer Rosenblum at the CIO conference in Lake Placid, New York on September 8th. Rosenblum condemned the notorious "Smith Act" and "McCarran Act" and warned: "The internal danger in the United States is the threat of fascism." In his speech, he emphasized: "Creeping fascism is the real threat to the United States, and we must take steps to resist it."

    美国工人反对迫害美共及进步工会
    纽约四千工人集会痛斥美政府蹂躏人权的罪行
    各工会代表要求杜鲁门废止反动“史密斯法”
    【新华社十五日讯】纽约消息：美国当局根据法西斯的“史密斯法”多批逮捕共产党的与非共产党的工人领袖的迫害暴行，已受到美国工人日趋广泛的反抗。
    纽约四千多名工人在十日晚间举行群众大会，痛斥杜鲁门政府这种违反宪法、蹂躏人权的行为，并号召大家进行最广泛的运动来保卫人民的民主权利。联合汽车工人工会密执安州分会书记胡德在会上警告说：美国的准法西斯势力已经在敲着整个劳工运动的“大门”了。他号召大家努力营救被捕的共产党领袖。他说：“我们必须动员起来，反抗这种罪恶的势力。”著名黑人和平战士罗伯逊在会上发言时指出：他在旅行全美的时候发现全体工人都准备向反动的“史密斯法”进行斗争。罗伯逊说，工人应该知道他们有着怎样的力量，并且一定要表现这种力量。大会最后通过决议要求取消法西斯的
    “史密斯法”。
    已经受到“史密斯法”直接迫害的各进步工会，对美国政府的法西斯阴谋表示了最大的愤慨。独立的联合电气工人工会的总书记恩斯派克和组织部长麦特斯曾被传讯，该工会主席费兹基拉尔德在十一日曾发表谈话，痛斥政府这种“反工会运动”的举动。
    纽约工人日报指出：美国工人这种反法西斯的坚决表现，“向全国显示了：这里有力量可以把美国由麦克锡主义和逐渐成长的法西斯主义中拯救出来”。这些拯救美国的民主自由的力量首先就存在于工人运动和工会中，这两股力量必须汇合起来。【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社纽约十五日讯：据“工人日报”旧金山消息，代表美国劳工联合会（劳联）、产业工会联合会（产联）及一些独立工会三万名工会工作者的一百七十五位代表，出席了“北加利福尼亚工会联合行动委员会”会议。会议指责依据臭名远扬的“史密斯法”逮捕进步人士，并要求杜鲁门立刻废止该法。
    会议同时决定在各地及全国发起运动，要求废止一切所谓“安全”及“忠诚”计划以及其他黑名单手段。会议是因为工会人士对于北加利福尼亚及其他西海岸港口的活跃的码头工会领袖被列入黑名单的事情日益感到不安而召开的。
    码头与仓库工人工会副主席巴尔克强调黑名单在他的工会内牵涉的范围很广，并警告说，工人如不积极地起来反抗，这种措施将蔓延到其他工会去。
    海船厨师侍者工会的正式代表马绍尔同样地指责黑名单，并着重指出他的工会积极地支持废除一切反劳工的措施。
    “工人日报”记者指出，甚至是一些保守的劳工领袖，也因为对工会的法西斯压迫日益加剧而愈益感到不安。“工人日报”记者强调指出产联副主席、混合成衣工人工会司库罗森伯鲁姆于九月八日在普拉塞德湖纽约州产联会议上所发表的演说。罗森伯鲁姆指责臭名远扬的“史密斯法”及“麦卡伦法”，并警告称：“美国内部的危险就是法西斯主义的威胁。”他在演说中强调称：“潜进的法西斯主义是对美国的真正威胁，我们必须采取步骤加以抵制。”
