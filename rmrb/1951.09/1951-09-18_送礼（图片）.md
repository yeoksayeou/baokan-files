    Gift-Giving
    By Shao Yu
    --Mid-Autumn Festival Greetings to Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel--
    Drums go 'dong dong'!
    Gongs go 'tang tang'!
    Soldiers defend the country at the front!
    Families of military personnel and martyrs are truly glorious;
    The gifts may be light, but the sentiment is deep!

    ——中秋节慰问烈属、军属——
    鼓咚咚！
    锣嘡嘡！
    战士们保国在前方！
    军属、烈属真光荣；
    礼物虽轻心意长！
