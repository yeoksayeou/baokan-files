Introducing the Wuhan Municipal机关（jī guān - government office/organization）Marxist-Leninist Night School

　　People who previously felt that studying theory was "sitting until their waist hurt, reading until their eyes hurt, and thinking until their head hurt" have now transformed into people who "sit steadily, read a lot, and think deeply."

　　In order to prepare for carrying out Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought theoretical education work and to cultivate theoretical instructors, the directly subordinate Party Committee of the Central China Bureau of the CPC, the Central-South Military and Political Committee, the Wuhan Municipal Committee, and the Hubei Provincial Committee jointly established the Wuhan Municipal机关（jī guān - government office/organization）Marxist-Leninist Night School in April. The students of the school are all selected and sent by various 机关（jī guān - government office/organization）. The qualifications for the students are that they must be in-service party member cadres with a cultural level of junior high school graduation or above and the ability to self-study. The first group of students consists of 543 people, with 405 auditors. Most of the students are the backbone members of various 机关（jī guān - government office/organization）. The entire school is divided into three classes, studying Political Common Sense, Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution, and Basic Marxism-Leninism, respectively. All students in the school are required to study special reports such as the Introduction to the Political Education System of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Ideological Methods and Study Methods. The Central China Bureau of the CPC organized a lecture group to be responsible for the teaching work of the night school. The study period for the students was originally set for four months, but due to the increase in courses and adjustment of study time, the first group of students will be extended to graduate in November.

　　Since its establishment, the school has made preliminary achievements in cultivating backbone members for guiding theoretical study. For example, on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Party, the school gave a report on Party history. Some students from the Wuhan Municipal Committee and various central-south 机关（jī guān - government office/organization）then returned to their respective 机关（jī guān - government office/organization）to deliver the report and answer some questions about Party history for cadres participating in the study, which was warmly welcomed by the cadres of the 机关（jī guān - government office/organization）. After four months of study, the students have all developed reading habits, cultivated their interest in learning, and strengthened their confidence in learning theory. People who previously felt that studying theory was "sitting until their waist hurt, reading until their eyes hurt, and thinking until their head hurt" have now transformed into people who "sit steadily, read a lot, and think deeply." During the learning process, the students preview before class, review after class, read books, take notes, hold discussion meetings, and study diligently. They have gained a lot from their studies and have realized that Marxism-Leninism is not something unattainable. The students have generally improved in their ideology, policies, and theory. Some students in financial and economic 机关（jī guān - government office/organization）have reflected on their past tendency to emphasize business over politics in their studies. Through this study, they have realized that mastering business and political study cannot be separated. After learning theory, everyone has specifically improved their work methods.

　　The Wuhan Municipal 机关（jī guān - government office/organization）Marxist-Leninist Night School has gained the following main experiences in the past four months: First, to run a night school well, the Party Committee must first pay attention to it and the masses must be conscious. Party committees at all levels should regard the work of carrying out theoretical education and cultivating theoretical instructors as a serious political task. Advocate the study of theory throughout the Party, so that party member cadres realize that theoretical study is the fundamental method for improving cadres and improving work, and oppose empiricism and the erroneous tendency of not asking about politics in actual work. Deng Zihui, Secretary of the Central China Bureau of the CPC, lectured the students on the great significance of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and learning theory from the historical experience of the Chinese revolutionary struggle at the opening of the school, which greatly encouraged everyone. The Wuhan Municipal Committee also held a theoretical education work conference to discuss the issue of running night schools and cultivating theoretical instructors. Party committees at all levels also carefully selected students. When selecting students, the Wuhan Municipal Committee conducted full ideological mobilization work. The list of students was discussed and approved by the branch and reviewed and approved by the Party Committee. The Party Committee provided the students entering the night school with conditions conducive to learning. At the same time, it is necessary to stimulate the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses, carry out criticism and self-criticism, advocate a honest learning attitude, and oppose a style of being lofty and unrealistic. Many study groups in the school have established a system of commendation and criticism, which has greatly promoted learning. Second, teach conscientiously and constantly improve teaching quality. Lecturers must carefully prepare the content to be taught, write a good teaching outline, and establish a collective teaching research system. The lecturers of the school established subject-based teaching and research groups to be responsible for researching and reviewing teaching outlines and discussing teaching content. Lecturers should fully understand the ideological situation of the students in order to conduct teaching in light of reality. Third, the study policy must emphasize self-study as the main method, supplemented by classroom learning. The learning method emphasizes linking with reality and improving the methods of observing and dealing with problems. The school also adopted five stages: preview, listening to lectures, review, group discussion, and classroom review. After the teachers finished teaching a unit, they conducted a classroom review. During the review, the teacher appointed one person to express their opinion on a certain issue, and everyone展开（zhǎn kāi - unfolded, launched) a discussion based on pre-prepared opinions, and the teacher made a final summary. Many students carefully read reference books and wrote outlines of their speeches before the review, and enthusiastically participated in the discussion during the review. This teaching method has achieved great results in helping students study problems and exercise their ability to systematically express their opinions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    介绍武汉市机关马列主义夜间学校
    从前感觉学习理论是“坐得腰痛，看得眼痛，想得头痛”的人，现在变为“坐得稳，看得多，想得远”了。
    为了准备开展马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的理论教育工作，培养理论教员，中共中央中南局、中南军政委员会直属党委、武汉市委和湖北省委于四月间联合创办了武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜间学校。该校学员都由各机关选送。学员的条件是要有初中毕业以上的文化水平并有自修能力的在职党员干部。第一期学员有五百四十三人，旁听生四百零五人。学员们大部分是各机关的骨干分子。全校分三个班次，分别学习政治常识、中国革命基本问题和马列主义基础三种科目，全校学员共同必修的有联共政治教育制度介绍、思想方法和学习方法等专题报告。中共中央中南局组织了讲师团，负责夜校的教学工作。学员的学习期限原定为四个月，后因增加课程和调整学习时间，第一期学员将延至十一月毕业。
    该校创办以来，在培养指导理论学习的骨干分子方面已有初步成绩。如在党的三十周年纪念前夕，该校作了党史报告，武汉市委和中南各机关的一些学员，即回到本机关作了传达报告，并为参加学习的干部们解答一部分有关党史的问题，受到机关干部热烈的欢迎。学员们经过四个月的学习，都养成了读书习惯，培养了学习兴趣，加强了学习理论的信心。从前感觉学习理论是“坐得腰痛，看得眼痛，想得头痛”的人，现在变为“坐得稳，看得多，想得远”了。学员在学习过程中，课前预习，课后复习，看书，写笔记，开讨论会，刻苦钻研，学习有很大收获，并认识到马克思列宁主义不是高不可攀的东西。学员们在思想上、政策上、和理论上普遍提高了一步。有些财经机关的学员，反省过去在学习中有重业务轻政治的倾向，通过这次学习已认识到精通业务与政治学习是不能分割的。大家学习理论以后，并具体改进了工作方法。
    武汉市机关马克斯列宁主义夜间学校四个月来获得以下几点主要经验：第一、办好夜校首先要党委重视和群众自觉。各级党委应将开展理论教育和培养理论教员的工作，看成一个严重的政治任务。在全党提倡学习理论，使党员干部认识到理论学习是提高干部和改进工作的根本方法，并在实际工作中反对经验主义与不问政治的错误倾向。中共中央中南局书记邓子恢在该校开学时就向学员讲授学习马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想和从中国革命斗争的历史经验中学习理论的重大意义，对大家起了很大的鼓励作用。武汉市委还召开了理论教育工作会议，讨论开办夜校和培养理论教员的问题。各级党委也认真选拔学员。武汉市委选拔学员时进行了充分的思想动员工作，学员名单都经支部讨论通过和党委审核批准。党委对入夜校的学员都予以便利于学习的条件。同时，必须启发群众的自觉性与积极性，开展批评与自我批评，提倡老老实实的学习态度，反对好高鹜远的作风。该校不少学习小组都建立了表扬和批评制度，对学习起了很大的推动作用。第二、认真教学，不断提高教学质量。讲师必须认真准备讲授内容，写好讲授提纲，并建立教学集体研究制度。该校讲师成立了分科教学研究小组，负责研究和审查讲授提纲，并讨论讲课内容。讲师们应充分了解学员的思想情况，才能结合实际进行教学。第三、学习方针必须强调以自学为主，辅以课堂学习。学习方法，强调联系实际，改进观察问题和处理问题的方法。该校还采取了预习、听讲、复习、小组讨论和课堂复习等五个阶段。教员每讲完一个单元，即进行一次课堂复习。复习时由教员指定一人对某问题发表意见，大家根据预先准备好的意见展开讨论，教员最后作总结。许多学员在复习前都认真看参考书，写发言提纲，复习时热烈参加讨论。这种教学方法对帮助学员们钻研问题和锻炼他们系统地发表意见，都收到很大效果。（新华社）
