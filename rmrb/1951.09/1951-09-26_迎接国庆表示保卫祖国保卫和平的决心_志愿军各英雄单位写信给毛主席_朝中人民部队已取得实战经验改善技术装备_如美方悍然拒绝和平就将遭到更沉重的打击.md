Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 25th: On the eve of National Day, commanders and fighters of hero units of the Chinese People's Volunteers, such as the "Guo Zhongtian Hero Platoon" and the "Sharp Knife Hero Battalion," wrote letters to Chairman Mao from the front lines, expressing their determination to defend the motherland and world peace.

Commanders and fighters of a certain "Sharp Knife Hero Battalion" that annihilated the U.S. 38th Regiment at Gari Hill were enthusiastically discussing in their fortifications what to report to Chairman Mao in their letter. Liao Daoyan, a soldier of the Eighth Company who was awarded a first-class merit, said, "First of all, we must report to Chairman Mao that if the U.S. side stubbornly refuses to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, we will fight them to the end!" Then, the soldiers said they wanted to tell Chairman Mao that they had learned a lot of new skills; others scrambled to write that the Volunteers would definitely win glory for the people of the motherland. After several discussions, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao in the name of the entire "Sharp Knife Hero Battalion." The letter said, "Respected Chairman Mao! We fully understand that without the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland under your leadership, our victory would not have been possible. The vigorous anti-American and aid-Korea movement in the motherland encourages us to advance victoriously, and the enthusiastic donation of weapons movement further strengthens our confidence in annihilating a large number of enemies." It also said, "In the past year, the Korean-Chinese People's Army has annihilated hundreds of thousands of enemy troops boasting so-called 'air and sea superiority,' fighting from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. If the enemy dares to stubbornly refuse to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, then the Korean-Chinese People's Army, which has gained practical experience and whose technical equipment has been significantly improved, will have greater strength to achieve true peace in Korea."

Commanders and fighters of a certain "Guo Zhongtian Hero Platoon" wrote in their letter to Chairman Mao: "When Guo Zhongtian returned to China, we specifically asked him to convey our greetings to you on behalf of our entire platoon. Even in the most intense battles, we have never forgotten you. You gave us wisdom, courage, and strength. All the glory belongs to you. When we hear the news that the motherland's production and construction are developing day by day, we are even more determined to resolutely defend the peace of Korea and the world, and defend the security of our motherland, together with the Korean People's Army. Respected Chairman Mao, we assure you: The 'Guo Zhongtian Hero Platoon' cherishes its own honor and strives to add new honors in future battles."

Commanders and fighters of a certain company, who were awarded the title of "Daochengxian Hero Company" for their meritorious service in breaking through the perilous Daochengxian during the New Year Offensive, reported their battle achievements to Chairman Mao. They said, "In the past five battles, with the support of the Chinese and Korean people and the correct leadership of our superiors, we have annihilated 284 enemies and captured a large number of weapons and equipment. In the past battles, a total of 139 people's meritorious workers have emerged from the entire company."

All the commanders and fighters of a certain meritorious unit wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, saying, "Now our combat effectiveness is far stronger than when we first entered Korea. Due to the improvement of nutrition conditions, everyone's weight has increased by three to five catties. Our equipment and technology have also been greatly improved. We have summarized our combat experience, and the morale of the troops is high. Everyone says, 'Our fists are harder than before!' If the American aggressors do not stop their acts of aggression, we will give them an even heavier blow."

    迎接国庆表示保卫祖国保卫和平的决心
    志愿军各英雄单位写信给毛主席
    朝中人民部队已取得实战经验改善技术装备
    如美方悍然拒绝和平就将遭到更沉重的打击
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十五日电】中国人民志愿军“郭忠田英雄排”“尖刀英雄营”等英雄单位的指战员们，在国庆节前，从前线写信给毛主席，表示他们决心保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的意志。
    曾在加里山痛歼美军第三十八团的某部“尖刀英雄营”指战员们，在工事里热烈讨论在信里面该向毛主席报告些什么。立了一等功的第八连战士廖道眼说：“首先要报告毛主席，如果美方硬不肯和平解决朝鲜问题，我们就和他们干到底！”接着，战士们这个说要告诉毛主席我们学会了好多新本领；那个抢着说要写上志愿军一定给祖国人民争光。经过了几次讨论，他们以“尖刀英雄营”全营名义写了一封向毛主席致敬的信。信里说：“敬爱的毛主席！我们完全知道，没有在您领导下的祖国人民的热烈支援，我们的胜利是不可能取得的。祖国轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动鼓舞着我们胜利前进，热火朝天的捐献武器运动更加振奋了我们大量歼灭敌人的信心。”又说：“在过去近一年中，朝中人民军队消灭了几十万吹嘘拥有所谓‘海空优势’的敌军，从鸭绿江边打到三八线附近。如果敌人敢于悍然拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，那么已经取得实战经验的和技术装备已有显著提高改善的朝中人民军队，就有更大的力量来取得朝鲜的真正和平。”
    某部“郭忠田英雄排”指战员在给毛主席的信上写着：“郭忠田回国时，我们特地请他一定要代表我们全排向您问好。即使在最紧张的战斗中，我们也从来没有忘记过您，您给了我们智慧、勇气和力量，一切的光荣是属于您的。当我们听到祖国的生产建设一天比一天发展的消息时，我们就更加下定决心，与朝鲜人民军一起，坚决保卫朝鲜和世界的和平，捍卫我们祖国的安全。敬爱的毛主席，我们向您保证：‘郭忠田英雄排’热爱自己的荣誉，争取在今后战斗中增添新的荣誉。”
    在新年攻势中，因突破天险道成岘有功而荣获“道成岘英雄连”称号的某连指战员，给毛主席报告了战绩。他们说：“在过去五次战役中，在中朝人民的支援和上级的正确领导下，我们已经歼灭敌人二百八十四人，缴获了大批武器装备。在历次战斗中，全连涌现了人民功臣一百三十九名。”
    功勋卓著的某部全体指战员写信给毛主席说：“现在我们的战斗力，远比才入朝鲜时增强了。由于营养条件的改善，每个人的体重增加了三斤到五斤。我们的装备与技术也大大改善、提高了。我们总结了战斗经验，部队里士气昂扬，人人都说：“我们的拳头比过去还要硬！”美国侵略者如果不停止他的侵略行为，我们将给予加倍沉重的打击。”
