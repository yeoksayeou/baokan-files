    The article "Xinle County Leading Cadres Erroneously Believe That the People's Representative Conference's Role is Not Significant," published in the August 14th edition of the People's Daily and the August 15th edition of the Hebei Daily, reflects the actual situation in our county. We completely agree and sincerely accept the criticism.

    After studying the People's Daily editorial and the criticism directed at our county, as well as the important documents on the construction of people's democratic power compiled by the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, we have recognized our mistakes, such as the bourgeois formalistic democratic tendencies that occurred during the election of representatives; the underestimation of the role of the People's Representative Conference; the confusion between the People's Representative Conference and cadre meetings; and the failure to establish the People's Representative Conference as a system. In the past (before the second representative conference in mid-July), we failed to adequately collect and address the representatives' proposals at each People's Representative Conference, nor did we report on the government's work to the representatives, and we did not maintain contact with the representatives after the meetings. We believe that the root causes of the above errors are: First, the county's leading cadres did not study the relevant documents on the construction of people's democratic power sufficiently, and they did not systematically organize county and district cadres to study and educate village cadres. Therefore, the leadership and cadres had a vague understanding of the significance and scope of authority of the People's Representative Conference. Second, we did not clearly recognize that the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress are the basic systems of our country and the basic organizational forms of the people's democratic power. We only regarded it as a good way to unite people from all walks of life, promote democracy, and advance our work. Third, cadres lacked a democratic work style, believing that the People's Representative Conference had "little effect" and was "quite troublesome." Therefore, even when meetings were held, they were only for assigning tasks. Fourth, dogmatism and a task-oriented perspective. For example, during the three-level elections (county, district, and village) held last spring, we adopted bourgeois formalistic democratic election methods, paying attention only to form and not substance, and failing to proceed according to the masses' awareness and the actual situation. Therefore, when mobilizing the masses to vote, we put in a lot of effort, but the results were not good, causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

    The second session of the People's Representative Conference of all circles in our county, held on July 14th this year, has already exercised the functions and powers of the County People's Congress on its behalf. This meeting was an improvement over the previous ones. We made fuller preparations before the meeting, notified the representatives in advance about the content of the meeting, distributed proposal forms, and most of the representatives solicited opinions from the masses, collecting a total of 188 proposals, which were all dealt with after the meeting. The election of representatives was changed to a show of hands; a government work report was made to the representatives at the meeting. Through this meeting, not only were the cadres educated, but the political awareness of the representatives was also raised. Most cadres have initially realized that the People's Representative Conference is the basic system of our country, and most representatives have clearly established the idea of being masters of their own affairs.

    Based on the above situation, we feel that in order to hold the County People's Representative Conference well in the future, we must pay attention to the following issues: First, we must earnestly organize county and district cadres to study the documents on the construction of democratic power. Leading cadres should personally take action and thoroughly resolve cadres' confused ideas and incorrect understandings of political power construction through study; at the same time, we must conduct systematic education on political power construction for village cadres so that cadres and the masses can recognize the great significance of the People's Representative Conference. Second, the People's Representative Conference, the Government Committee, and the Standing Committee should be convened on time. Each representative conference must report the government's work to the representatives, and all major tasks must be discussed and resolved by the conference before being handed over to the government for specific implementation. Third, we must seriously handle the representatives' proposals, because the proposals are the issues that the representatives care about most. Representatives must be notified in advance to allow them sufficient time to contact the masses in order to widely collect proposals, and they should be handled seriously at the meeting. Fourth, after each People's Representative Conference, we must make a good summary of the work so that the representative conference can gradually improve.

    为什么没有开好人民代表会议？
    ——河北新乐县县长李纯良的检讨
    八月十四日人民日报及八月十五日河北日报发表的“新乐县领导干部错误认为人民代表会议作用不大”一文，是我县的实际情况，我们完全同意，诚恳接受。
    我们在学习人民日报社论和对我县的批评，以及中央人民政府政务院华北事务部编印的人民民主政权建设重要文件后，认识了自己的错误，如选举代表时发生的资产阶级形式民主偏向；轻视人民代表会议的作用；将人民代表会议和干部会混淆；以及未将人民代表会议形成制度等。以往（七月中第二届代表会前）每次人民代表会议，我们均未很好地搜集与处理代表提案，也未向代表报告政府工作，开会之后即不联系代表。我们认为发生以上错误的根源是：第一，县领导干部对有关人民民主政权建设文件学习研究不够，没有系统地组织县区干部学习和对村干部进行教育。因此领导上及干部对人民代表会议的意义、职权范围认识模糊。第二，对人民代表会议与人民代表大会是我们国家的基本制度、是人民民主政权的基本组织形式这一点认识不够明确。我们只是认为它是团结各阶层人民，发扬民主，推动工作的好方式。第三，干部缺乏民主作风，觉得人民代表会议“作用不大”而且“麻烦不小”，因此即便开会也是为布置工作，交付任务。第四，教条主义与任务观点。如去年春季举行县、区、村的三级选举，我们采取了资产阶级形式民主的选举方法，只注意形式不重实质，没有根据群众觉悟和实际情况去进行。因此发动群众进行投票选举时，费劲很大，而效果不好，引起群众不满。
    今年七月十四日我县召开的第二届各界人民代表会议，已代行了县人民代表大会职权。此次会议较前有了改进，会前作了较充分的准备，事先通知了代表关于会议的内容，印发了提案表，大多数代表征求了群众意见，共搜集了代表提案一八八件，会后均作了处理；代表的选举改为举手表决；会上向代表作了政府工作报告。通过此次会议，不但教育了干部，也提高了代表的政治觉悟。多数干部已初步认识到人民代表会议是我们国家的基本制度，大多数代表则明确树立了主人翁的思想。
    根据以上情况，我们感到今后要开好县各界人民代表会议，必须注意以下几个问题：第一，切实组织县、区干部学习民主政权建设文件。领导干部应亲自动手，从学习中彻底解决干部对政权建设的糊涂观念和不正确认识；同时，并对村干部进行系统地政权建设教育，使干部和群众都认识人民代表会议的重大意义。第二，按期召开人民代表会议、政府委员会及常务委员会。每次代表会议必须向代表报告政府工作，一切重大的工作必须经会议讨论作成决议，交政府具体执行。第三，认真处理代表提案，因为提案是代表最关心的问题。必须提前通知代表，使之有充分时间与群众联系，以便广泛搜集提案，而在会议上则应严肃认真地处理。第四，每次人民代表会议后，必须很好地总结工作，使代表会逐步提高。
