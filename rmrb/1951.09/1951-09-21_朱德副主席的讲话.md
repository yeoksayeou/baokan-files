Comrades and representatives of labor models:

    The National Railway Labor Model Representative Conference opens today. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I extend my congratulations to you and wish the conference a success!

    Chinese railway workers have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Since liberation, under the leadership and education of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the class consciousness of the vast number of workers has been further enhanced. Therefore, the railway construction cause of New China, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the joint efforts of all railway employees, has made great progress. According to reports, many lines have been completed on schedule or ahead of schedule, and the state-stipulated transportation tasks for last year and the first half of this year have been completed ahead of schedule, especially the emergency repair and transportation tasks for military transportation. This has played a significant role in promoting national economic prosperity, connecting urban and rural materials, supporting the Korean War to Resist U.S. Aggression, and consolidating national defense construction. The achievements made on the railways in the past two years are inseparable from the active role you have played among the masses. Here, I express my gratitude and respect for your work!

    At present, the national financial and economic situation is steadily improving, and construction work in various fields has also made considerable progress. On the military front, the Chinese and Korean People's forces have inflicted heavy blows on the U.S. aggressors at the front over the past year. However, the U.S. imperialists, this mad dog, have not learned the lessons they should have from their repeated failures, and are still exhausting all despicable and barbaric means to obstruct and disrupt the Kaesong armistice negotiations, and have signed a one-sided "peace treaty" with Japan at the San Francisco Conference, which they organized single-handedly, in an attempt to openly rearm Japan and use it as a base for their aggression against China and sabotage of Asian peace.

    Comrades! In order to defend the fruits of our revolutionary victory and to consolidate our great motherland, we must completely shatter the U.S. imperialists' plan to enslave Asia. All railway workers must, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely and unremittingly strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, continue to work hard to run the people's railways well, further strengthen patriotic labor competitions on the existing basis, implement the economic accounting system, better complete the transportation tasks and new line construction tasks assigned to you by the state, and give full play to the potential power of the railway industry to manufacture more machinery and equipment, and strive to build a strong national defense force and economic force.

    Comrades! This conference of yours has gathered the most outstanding model workers in the country's railways, and has brought the best experiences and working methods of railway workers across the country. Therefore, I hope that everyone will earnestly summarize the experiences and use them as a direction for continued efforts and struggles in the future, and vigorously promote advanced working methods and pass on your advanced experiences to others. If every labor model can take on two apprentices, the country can add millions of advanced workers. We must use this method to consolidate and develop existing achievements. At the same time, I hope that everyone will not become arrogant and complacent because they have made achievements and received honors; on the contrary, they should always maintain a humble attitude, constantly learn from the masses, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to improve their political, cultural, and technical levels. Only in this way can they always maintain the glorious title of labor model and complete the important tasks entrusted to them by the state and the people.

    I wish you comrades good health!

    朱德副主席的讲话各位劳动模范代表同志们：
    全国铁路劳动模范代表大会今天开幕，我代表中国共产党中央委员会向大家致贺，并预祝大会的成功！
    中国铁路工人有着光荣的革命传统。解放以来，在毛主席和共产党的领导、教育之下，广大职工的阶级觉悟是更加提高了。因此，新中国的铁路建设事业，在中央人民政府的正确领导和全体铁路员工的共同努力之下，有了很大的进展。根据报告，许多线路都已如期或提前完成，并提前完成了去年和今年上半年国家所规定的运输任务，特别是完成了军事运输上的抢修、抢运任务。这对于繁荣国家经济、沟通城乡物资、支援抗美援朝、巩固国防建设，都起了重大的作用。两年来，铁路上所获得的成绩，是和你们在群众中所起的积极作用分不开的。在这里，我对你们的工作表示感谢和敬意！
    目前国家财政经济状况正在稳步好转，各方面的建设工作也都有了相当的成绩。在军事方面，中朝人民部队一年来在前方惨重地打击了美国侵略者。但是，美帝国主义这只疯狗，并没有从它屡次的失败中吸取应有的教训，还正在竭尽一切卑鄙蛮横的手段来阻挠和破坏开城停战谈判，并在一手包办的旧金山会议上签订了片面的对日“和约”，想借此公开重新武装日本，以便作为它侵略中国、破坏亚洲和平的基地。
    同志们！为了保卫我们革命的胜利果实，为了巩固我们伟大的祖国，我们必须彻底打碎美帝国主义奴役亚洲的计划。全体铁路职工，必须和全国人民一道，坚决不懈地加强抗美援朝运动，继续努力办好人民铁路，在现有的基础上，进一步加强爱国主义劳动竞赛，贯彻经济核算制，更好地完成国家给你们的运输任务和新线路建设任务，并发挥铁路工业的潜在力量，更多地制造各种机器和器材，为建设强大的国防力量和经济力量而奋斗。
    同志们！你们这次会议，集中了全国铁路最优秀的模范工作者，又带来了全国铁路职工最好的经验和工作方法，因此，希望大家认真地把经验总结起来，作为今后继续努力和奋斗的方向，并大力推广先进的工作方法，把自己的先进经验传授给别人。如果每一个劳动模范都能带两个徒弟，则全国就可以多增加千万个先进工作者。我们要用这样的办法来巩固和发扬已有的成绩。同时，更希望大家不要因为作出了成绩、得到了荣誉，就产生骄傲自满的情绪；相反，应该始终保持谦虚的态度，经常向群众学习，向苏联的先进经验学习，并努力提高自己的政治、文化和技术水平，只有这样，才能使自己永远保持劳动模范的光荣称号，完成国家和人民所托付的重大任务。
    祝同志们健康！
