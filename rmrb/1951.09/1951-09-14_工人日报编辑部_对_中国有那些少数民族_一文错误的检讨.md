    Self-Criticism Regarding the Article "What Ethnic Minorities Exist in China"
    The People's Daily "Readers' Letters" column on September 4th published a self-criticism from the "Hebei Education" Society and the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Education regarding the errors in the article "What Ethnic Minorities Exist in China." The "Hebei Education" Society's self-criticism stated: "This article was reprinted from the Worker's Daily of September 12, 1949," which is a fact.
    We also clipped this material from a local small newspaper (the original manuscript cannot be found). At the time, due to a shortage of稿件, we hurriedly published it in the newspaper. This first shows that our work attitude at the time was very wrong. Our original intention in publishing this article was to illustrate that China is a multi-ethnic country, in order to oppose Han chauvinism; however, because we did not carefully review the wording in the稿件, the names that discriminatory and insulting to ethnic minorities, which are commonly used by Han chauvinists, were published without modification. Unintentionally, we spread Han chauvinist thought and insulted ethnic minorities. Although we lacked knowledge about ethnic minorities, and although the "Government Administration Council's Directive on Handling Terms, Place Names, Steles, and Plaques Bearing Discriminatory or Insulting Nature Towards Ethnic Minorities" had not yet been published at that time, there were some very obvious words that slandered ethnic minorities that we should and could have seen. We have no reason to say that we were so ignorant. The problem is: we have serious careless work styles and irresponsible work attitudes in our work, not using our brains and not thinking. This is the main reason for this error. We only realized this error after seeing the criticism in the People's Daily.
    This is a serious political error, and this is an extremely distorted promotion of the People's Government's ethnic policy. In addition to conducting a deep self-criticism on this issue, we are determined to strengthen our study, improve our political awareness and ideological level, and establish a serious and responsible working style to the masses, so as to avoid similar errors from happening again.

### 工人日报编辑部  对“中国有那些少数民族”一文错误的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    工人日报编辑部
    对“中国有那些少数民族”一文错误的检讨
    九月四日人民日报“读者来信”栏，刊登了“河北教育”社和河北省文教厅对“中国有那些少数民族”一文所犯错误的检讨。“河北教育”社的检讨中说：“这篇文章是从一九四九年九月十二日的工人日报上转载的”，这是事实。
    这个材料，我们也是从一个地方小报（原稿查不到了）上剪下来的。当时因为稿缺，就匆忙地把它登到报上。这首先说明我们当时的工作态度就是十分错误的。我们当时刊登这篇稿子的意思，原是想说明中国是一个多民族的国家，用以反对大汉族主义的；但是由于没有慎重审查稿件中的用语，结果反而将大汉族主义者所习用的歧视和侮辱少数民族的名称，不加修改地发表出来，无意中散布了大汉族主义思想，侮辱了少数民族。虽然我们对少数民族缺乏常识，虽然“政务院关于处理带有歧视或侮辱少数民族性质的称谓、地名、碑碣、匾联的指示”当时还没有发表，但是，有一些很明显的污蔑少数民族的字眼，我们是应该而且能够看出来的，我们没有理由说自己竟无知到这种地步。问题是：我们在工作中存在着严重的粗枝大叶作风和不负责任的工作态度，不用脑子，不去思考。这就是发生这次错误的主要原因。这个错误，直到看见人民日报的批评以后，我们才知道。
    这是一个严重的政治性的错误，这是对人民政府民族政策的极端歪曲的宣传。我们除对这个问题进行深刻地检讨外，决心加强学习，提高我们的政治觉悟和思想水平，树立严肃的、对群众负责的工作作风，以免今后再发生类似的错误。工人日报编辑部
