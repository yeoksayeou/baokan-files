(I) The Beautiful Future of the New Huai River Basin

The first year of the project to fundamentally control the Huai River has been successfully completed before the flood season. The completed part of the project has already played a significant role, ensuring a bumper harvest in the summer and autumn seasons of the Huai River basin this year. Looking at the entire plan for fundamentally controlling the Huai River, the future of the Huai River basin is infinitely bright.

Fundamentally controlling the Huai River is a great and historically significant struggle to change the natural appearance of the Huai River basin. After the completion of all the projects, firstly, the entire Huai River basin can be guaranteed to be free from the threat of floods forever. More than 40 million mu of land can be irrigated by the newly built projects, increasing yields by more than 50% annually. According to the past records of floods in the Huai River basin, the average annual loss is roughly estimated at about 6 million mu. If the minimum yield per mu is calculated at 100 jin, after the above-mentioned projects are completed, the annual flood control benefit can increase grain production by 600 million jin. The annual irrigation benefit, calculated at an increase of 50 jin per mu, can increase grain production by 2 billion jin. The waterway transportation of the Huai River is connected to the Grand Canal and the Yangtze River. Steamships can travel from the hinterland of Henan and northern Anhui directly to Shanghai, and a transverse transportation route will be added between the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Because waterway transportation is the cheapest mode of transportation, it will make a great contribution to the exchange of materials. The large-scale construction of farmland water conservancy projects and power stations will naturally also play an important auxiliary role in the development of agriculture and industry in the entire basin.

(II) The Basic Situation of the Old Huai River Basin

But what was the face of the old Huai River like? Everyone knows that for many years, the Huai River and its tributaries have been a major disaster for the people of Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. According to incomplete records, from 246 BC to 1948 AD, about two thousand years, there were 979 major floods. From 1855 to 1948, in 90 years, there were a total of 14 major floods, including 49 million mu of land flooded in 1921 and 77 million mu of land flooded in 1931. In 1950, less than a year after the complete liberation of the Huai River basin, a serious flood also occurred due to an extraordinary flood, with a total of 43.5 million mu of affected land, including both light and heavy disasters. In northern Anhui alone, the affected land accounted for 60% of the total cultivated area. Only with the vigorous rescue by the People's Government were the people of northern Anhui able to survive the famine.

The reason why the Huai River basin is so prone to disasters is, on the one hand, due to natural conditions, but mainly because Chinese society has long stagnated in the feudal society and the semi-colonial and semi-feudal social stage. In particular, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the ruling class neglected and even destroyed water conservancy undertakings, thus causing serious adverse consequences.

The natural conditions of the Huai River are inherently prone to floods. The Huai River originates in the Tongbai Mountains of Henan, flows through the three provinces of Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, and empties into the Yangtze River. The total length is about 1,100 kilometers, and the basin area (excluding the Yi-Shu River area) is about 210,000 square kilometers. Judging from the ratio of the basin area to the number of tributaries, the Huai River has a particularly large number of tributaries compared to other rivers in China, and they are arranged very densely. In the two provinces of Henan and northern Anhui, there are 29 major tributaries that flow directly into the Huai River, and the total number of smaller tributaries is more than 180. Therefore, as long as several areas in Henan and northern Anhui experience simultaneous heavy rainfall, most tributaries will rise simultaneously, converging into an unusually large flood that the Huai River's main stream cannot contain. The channel capacity of the Huai River's main stream is insufficient, and the slope of the riverbed is gentle. In terms of channel capacity, calculated according to the great floods of 1921, 1931, and 1950, the channel of the Huai River's main stream can only contain half of the maximum flood in many river sections. Moreover, there are also serious water-blocking phenomena at the Xiayangkou Gorge in Fengtai, the iron bridge in Bengbu, and the Fushan in Wuhe. In terms of the slope of the riverbed, the slope above Honghekou is one in ten thousand, the slope from Honghekou to Zhengyangguan is one in fifty thousand, and the slope from Zhengyangguan to Xuyi is one in ninety thousand. Because the downstream slope is particularly gentle, the period of flood discharge is prolonged, which not only increases the chances of the floods of various tributaries meeting, easily causing a larger flood peak, but also affects the discharge of tributaries and inland rainwater because the Huai River's main stream maintains a relatively high water level for a long time.

The Yellow River's diversion into the Huai River has caused serious damage to the Huai River basin's water system. Under normal circumstances, larger rivers are often separated by mountains, which serve as the boundary between the two basins. However, east of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the area between the Yellow River and the Huai River is a sloping surface that is high in the north and low in the south, with a slope of about one in six thousand to one in seven thousand. Therefore, historically, whenever the southern bank of the Yellow River breached, the Huai River basin was always the destination for its muddy torrents. The longest period was from 1194 to 1855 (i.e., the fifth year of Shaoxi of Emperor Guangzong of the Southern Song Dynasty to the fifth year of Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty), a period of 661 years, during which the Yellow River diverted the Huai River's channel into the sea from below the current Hongze Lake (the Huai River originally flowed into the sea through the current "abandoned Yellow River" channel at Yuntiguan in northern Jiangsu). This major change caused several serious adverse consequences for the Huai River basin: (1) The downstream of the Huai River was propped up by the Yellow River, and the water discharge was not smooth, causing the water flow to overflow, expanding the original Fuling Lake, Baishuitang, and Pofutang into the current Hongze Lake, as a place for stagnation and ripples. The main strategy of the Ming and Qing Dynasties to control the Huai River was to intentionally use Hongze Lake to store water in order to flush the Yellow River's sediment, which not only caused the area of Hongze Lake to expand and the water level to rise, but also caused the Huai River's main stream above Hongze Lake to be propped up by the lake water, gradually reducing the slope and raising the water level, further increasing the difficulty of discharging tributary floods; in the event of particularly large floods, some tributaries were even backflowed by the Huai River's main stream. (2) The Huai River's channel into the sea was silted up by the Yellow River, gradually raising it, and the water discharge became even more unsmooth. As a result, the Huai River flowed south from Hongze Lake, passing through lakes such as Gaoyou and Baoying and into the Yangtze River. After the Yellow River changed its course to Shandong in 1855, the Huai River's channel into the sea was completely silted up, leaving only one outlet into the Yangtze River. In 1938, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang criminally excavated the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou in Henan, which was the most recent invasion of the Yellow River into the Huai River. This time, the Yellow River diverted into the Huai River from the upper and middle reaches, and the scope of impact was even wider. In Henan, many smaller tributaries were silted up, making it impossible for rainwater to be discharged, causing serious waterlogging. In northern Anhui, the mouths of many larger tributaries flowing into the Huai River were silted up, making it difficult for tributary floods to be discharged, and the main stream of the Huai River was also silted up a lot in many places. Taking Bengbu as an example, in 1950, the flow was 300 cubic meters per second less than in 1931, but the water level was 0.98 meters higher, and the situation of riverbed silting can be imagined.

In summary, it can be explained that the frequent occurrence of floods in the Huai River basin is a comprehensive problem of the upper, middle, and lower reaches, which cannot be solved by local rectification alone. However, the past feudal ruling class, with their vision limited to selfish local interests, never made and could not possibly make an overall plan for the governance of the Huai River. On the contrary, they sometimes implemented the criminal policy of "making a ditch at the expense of one's neighbors," which caused sharp opposition between the upper, middle, and lower reaches. The upper reaches considered how to discharge the flood, but did not consider whether the other party could accommodate it. The middle reaches considered how to prevent the flood from discharging downstream, but did not consider the other party's disaster. At the same time, for the prevention of floods within their own regions, they blindly built embankments to prevent water, without studying how much flood could come from the upper reaches and whether the river channel between the two embankments could contain it. Some greedy and selfish landlords even built enclosures in the riverbed or reclaimed lakes for water storage, only caring about their own interests and completely ignoring the safety of others. Such piecemeal governance and some buildings left by them were not only useless for river control, but also aggravated the disasters of the Huai River. This is another situation in the Huai River basin.

In the upper reaches of each river, because the forests have been destroyed and cannot contain water flow, disasters are often caused by mountain torrents. The annual rainfall distribution in the entire basin is uneven, and floods easily occur in the rainy season, but when farmland needs water, there is not enough water. These are also important issues that must be considered in the governance of the Huai River.

(III) The New Policy for Governing the Huai River

Based on the above situation, the State Council of the Central People's Government proposed the policy of "simultaneous storage and discharge" in its decision on governing the Huai River issued in October 1950. In order to implement this policy, two important principles were put forward: one is to take into account the upper, middle, and lower reaches, and the other is to focus on flood control. We must first eradicate water disasters, and at the same time combine the needs of irrigation, navigation, and power generation, and gradually achieve multi-objective basin development.

This policy not only fully conforms to the actual situation of the Huai River basin, providing an important guarantee for the realization of the Huai River control project, but also marks the fundamental difference in the ideology and technology of river management between the people's era and the past reactionary ruling era.

During the period of reactionary rule, water control work was limited by the feudal system and the class interests of the reactionary ruling class. The governance of a river often proceeded from the temporary interests of the ruling class in one region, only seeing the interests of one region and not seeing the mutually related interests of other regions in the entire basin. There was a lack of comprehensive and systematic understanding of rainfall and water conditions. Therefore, most projects were highly localized, blind, and one-sided. Although a lot of manpower and material resources were spent, the problem could not be truly solved. Compared with these backward and erroneous river management methods, the policy of simultaneous storage and discharge proposed by the State Council is a major revolution in the ideology of river management. The so-called simultaneous storage and discharge includes several important meanings: first, it takes care of the overall situation and opposes local views. The upper, middle, and lower reaches of a river are closely related and inseparable. Only by making an overall plan for the entire basin can the problem be thoroughly solved. All piecemeal governance will inevitably cause opposition and contradiction between regions. Secondly, it proposes the method of water storage and combines it with the method of water discharge to expand the road to water control and benefit, so that water conservancy undertakings can achieve multi-objective integration and achieve the most economical and beneficial results for production. As long as a comprehensive survey and analysis of the supply and demand of water sources in the entire basin is carried out, it will naturally be seen that although water can be harmful when it is not controlled, it can all be turned into valuable resources that are beneficial to production as long as it is well controlled. During the rainy season of the year, the amount of water seems to be too much, but when water is needed, the amount of water is greatly insufficient. Therefore, the treatment of water flow should not simply seek drainage and send the water flow to the sea in vain, but should use all available lakes, depressions, and artificially constructed reservoirs, ditches, ponds, and dams to temporarily store water during the flood season to avoid disasters downstream. After the flood, it is slowly released to supply the needs of navigation, irrigation, and power generation. The time of arrival and the quantity of water flow of natural water flow are beyond human control. Therefore, our utilization of water has a certain limit. With the method of water storage, the discharge of water flow can be completely controlled by our will. Then, the road to developing production by using water flow will be wider. It is economical to eliminate harm and benefit, and one project can achieve the most economical effect. However, even after a large amount of water storage, the entire river system of the Huai River must be reorganized and dredged in order to ensure safety and provide navigation, irrigation, and drainage. There is no doubt that simultaneous storage and discharge is the most correct policy for governing the Huai River.

(IV) The Entire Plan for Governing the Huai River

Based on the policy of simultaneous storage and discharge and the situation of the Huai River basin, the entire plan for governing the Huai River includes the following main projects: The first is a huge water storage project. 12 billion cubic meters of water will be stored in the upper and middle reaches to eliminate the disaster of the Huai River flooding and provide for the needs of various water conservancy undertakings in the entire basin. The second is the river channel regulation project of the main streams and tributaries, so that the Huai River after water storage becomes a river with smooth drainage and developed navigation. The third is the project of separating the Huai River from Hongze Lake, so that Hongze Lake can play a greater role in regulating floods in the main stream of the Huai River, and use the water stored in the lake to maintain and develop the irrigation of 25 million mu of farmland in northern Jiangsu. As for the "opening of a channel into the sea" proposed in the decision of the State Council on governing the Huai River in October 1950, it was because the survey work of the entire basin had not been fully completed at that time, and the possible capacity of water storage in the upper and middle reaches had not been fully and accurately estimated. Therefore, the opening of a channel into the sea was considered to discharge the excessive flood after interception and storage. Now, the water storage capacity in the upper and middle reaches has been greatly increased, and there is no need to open the channel into the sea. This change further increases the importance of the water storage project in the Huai River control project, but its basic spirit is still completely consistent with the policy determined by the State Council. The following is the outline of the entire plan.

(1) Estimation and Distribution of the Maximum Water Volume of the Huai River Basin

Regarding the total water volume of the Huai River basin, according to the rainfall and hydrological data over the years, especially the data of the three flood years with the largest floods in 1921, 1931, and 1950, it is estimated that the possible maximum total flood volume flowing through Zhongdu (Hongze Lake outlet) within 150 days of the flood season is 76 billion cubic meters, considering the safety and economy of the project. We will use this number as the total planned flood volume for Huai River control. Regarding the distribution of this total flood volume, according to the reservoir sites and the amount of water stored in lakes and depressions that we found in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River that can be used to intercept and store floods, combined with the needs of flood control, irrigation, navigation, and power generation in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, and the possible water discharge after the existing river channels are regulated, we believe that such a huge amount of flood should be treated separately according to the following methods, which can completely eliminate the disaster of floods: In the upper reaches, in Henan Province, effective flood storage of 3.5 billion cubic meters should be achieved, and in the middle reaches, in northern Anhui Province, effective flood storage of 8.5 billion cubic meters should be achieved. After such interception and storage, the maximum flood flow of the Huai River at Zhengyangguan can not exceed 5,500 cubic meters per second, the flow at the mouth of Dongfei River can not exceed 5,000 cubic meters per second, after converging with the Wo River, the flow at Bengbu can not exceed 7,000 cubic meters per second, after converging with the tributaries of the Suxian Prefecture, the flow at Fushan can not exceed 8,700 cubic meters per second, and together with the rivers that flow directly into Hongze Lake, the maximum flow above Hongze Lake can not exceed 11,400 cubic meters per second. After the regulation of Hongze Lake, and opening up an irrigation canal directly to the sea from Hongze Lake to the east to divert 700 cubic meters, the flow from the three rivers into the Yangtze River below Hongze Lake can not exceed 7,000 cubic meters per second. According to this standard, floods can generally be completely eliminated.

(2) Water Storage Projects that Must be Carried out in Coordination with this Water Volume Distribution

In coordination with this water volume distribution, in the upper reaches, in Henan Province, in order to store 3.5 billion cubic meters of flood, a total of 13 valley reservoirs should be built, namely the Dapoling Reservoir, Nanwan Reservoir, and Dushucun Reservoir at the source of the Huai River, the Longshan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Huang River, the Boshan Reservoir, Shimantan Reservoir, and Banqiao Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Honghe and Ruhe river systems, the Shengjiadian Reservoir and Niuyushan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Guan River, and the Xiatang Reservoir, Caolou Reservoir, Ziluoshan Reservoir, and Baisha Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Ying River system. In addition, four lake and depression flood storage projects should be carried out in Tonghu, Wu Songhu, Laowangpo, and Jiaoting Lake. In the middle reaches, in northern Anhui Province, in order to store 8.5 billion cubic meters of flood, a total of three valley reservoirs should be built, namely the Meishan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Shi River, and the Foziling Reservoir and Changzhuyuan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Pi River. The main projects are the flood storage projects in more than ten lakes and depressions such as Menghe Depression, Runhe Depression, the west and east lakes of Huoqiu City, Qiujia Lake, Jiangjia Lake, Tangduo Lake, Mengjia Lake, Jiaogang Lake, and Wabuhu. Among them, the West Lake of the city has the largest flood storage capacity, reaching 2.75 billion cubic meters. In order to flexibly control the storage and discharge of water flow and give full play to the effectiveness of the flood storage project, a huge control project should be built on the main stream of the Runhe Collection Huai River. This control project is divided into three parts, namely fixed river channel, river blocking gate and lake entry gate. Ordinary water flow can flow from the fixed river channel to the downstream as a year-round unobstructed river channel. When encountering a larger flood, the opening and closing of the river blocking gate and the lake entry gate can be used to put the water downstream or store the water in the lake, depending on the situation in the upper and lower reaches, as a key operating mechanism of the Huai River's main stream above Hongze Lake.

These flood storage projects mainly focus on flood control and also take into account the needs of irrigation. In addition to valley flood storage, lake and depression flood storage projects are projects generated based on the special situation of the Huai River basin. Because part of the rivers in the Huai River basin originate in the mountainous areas in the west and south, and part of the rivers flow out of the slope between the Yellow River and the Huai River, the valley reservoirs cannot control the entire water flow due to terrain restrictions. In addition, the flow rate of water flowing down the slope is still very large. After the construction of the reservoirs, the river channel still cannot contain it, and lakes and depressions must be used as supplementary water storage projects. In northern Anhui, lake water storage is the main method of flood storage. The total area of existing perennial water-accumulating lakes and depressions in northern Anhui, excluding Hongze Lake, is about 3,000 square kilometers. These lakes are generally connected to rivers, naturally playing a certain regulatory role on the rivers. However, because there is no control and perennial water accumulation, the effectiveness of flood storage cannot be fully exerted. Agricultural products inside are also flooded nine times in ten years, and a certain harvest cannot be guaranteed. Now, by sorting out and controlling, ordinary floods cannot flow in, and water will only be released into the lake when encountering larger floods. In this way, because it is usually dry and there is no water stored in the lake, the effectiveness of flood storage can be greatly increased. Because the storage and discharge of water in the lake is regulated, the accumulated water is discharged after the flood, and the water flow is prevented from entering in the spring, a part of the land in the lake can be dried out to ensure a season of wheat harvest. In the entire Huai River control plan, the total water storage is 12 billion cubic meters (excluding Hongze Lake), valley reservoirs only account for more than 3 billion, and the total flood storage of lakes and depressions accounts for about more than 8 billion, which shows the importance of this type of project in the entire Huai River control project.

(3) River Channel Regulation Project that Must be Carried out in Conjunction with the Flood Storage Project

After the largest possible flood in the Huai River basin is intercepted and stored in a planned way, the flow of each section of the Huai River's main stream has a calculable maximum limit. Therefore, we can regulate and improve the river channel of each section according to the planned flood flow of each section, including carrying out necessary embankment construction, dredging, excavation of diversion rivers, and partial channel change projects. Among them, the more important ones are: in the upper reaches, in Henan Province, the Huai River's main stream in the Honghekou section should be regulated to relieve the waterlogging disaster in the Huangchuan Prefecture; the Ruhe, Honghe, Yinghe, and the rivers in the Yellow Flood Area should be dredged, the distance between the embankments should be widened, and the embankments should be repaired to safely discharge the water coming from the upper reaches after flood storage and the local rainwater. In the middle reaches, in northern Anhui Province, the embankments in the Zhengyangguan to Wuhe section should be strengthened to consolidate the safety of the river channel; the silted tributaries should be dredged, especially the important tributaries in the Fuyang Prefecture and Suxian Prefecture, to solve the problem of discharging inland rainwater.

The largest project in the river channel regulation is the governance of the Huai River's main stream below Wuhe. Because the Huai River's main stream below Wuhe flows through Hongze Lake, it has been affected by the stagnation of Hongze Lake for hundreds of years, which has caused the water level of the Huai River's main stream to be too high, affecting the discharge of tributary floods during the flood season, and sometimes causing backflow. Because Hongze Lake is not controlled, it cannot fully exert its flood storage effect. There are two larger projects for the governance of this section of the river: the first is the diversion of internal and external water: that is, in the Wuhe to Fushan section, the waterway for discharging inland rainwater should be separated from the main stream of the Huai River, so that the discharge of internal water is not affected by the main stream of the Huai River, so as to solve the serious waterlogging problem in the Suxian Prefecture. (It is determined that the inland river water level in Wuhe does not exceed 16.5 meters, and in Fushan does not exceed 15.5 meters. The water level of the Huai River's main stream is tentatively set at 17.5 meters in Fushan. In the future, the water flow will be used to flush and dredge to strive to reach 15.5 meters.) The second is to separate Hongze Lake from the Huai River: that is, the Huai River's main stream should excavate a diversion river below Xuyi, leaving aside Hongze Lake, and directly connecting the three rivers, passing through lakes such as Gaobao and entering the Yangtze River, and building dams for entering and leaving the lake between the Huai River and Hongze Lake to control it, so that the Huai River becomes an independent river channel and Hongze Lake becomes a controlled reservoir. In this way, the water flow of the Huai River's main stream can be discharged faster, and the time for the upper, middle, and upper reaches and tributaries to discharge flood can be easily grasped and adjusted, and the flood discharge efficiency of the Huai River channel can be greatly improved. Smooth water flow, the river channel is easy to naturally flush deeper, and after sorting it out, it can become a well-conditioned navigation system. Because Hongze Lake is controlled, the internal water flowing in at ordinary times can also be discharged from a part of the irrigation channels in northern Jiangsu and the sluice gates leading to the Huai River, and the flood storage capacity will inevitably be greatly increased, which has great benefits for flood control and irrigation.

(4) Planning for Irrigation, Navigation, and Power Generation Projects

As mentioned earlier, although the water disasters in the Huai River basin are very serious, water is often insufficient in the dry season, and the natural flow of rainfall and the Huai River cannot fully meet the needs of farmland irrigation. In low-water years, there will also be serious problems with waterway transportation. Therefore, the plan for governing the Huai River must store most of the larger water volume during the flood season to meet the needs of the dry season. According to the amount of water stored in the above-mentioned water storage project, combined with the terrain and farmland water use conditions in various places, the plan for irrigation projects in the Huai River basin is calculated as follows: The upper reaches of the reservoir stores 3.5 billion cubic meters of water, which can develop 6 million to 9 million mu of paddy fields, and the lake and depression water storage in the middle reaches can also develop about 10 million mu of paddy fields if it is reused. After Hongze Lake is separated from the Huai River, about 4 billion cubic meters of water is stored, and an irrigation canal to the sea is opened up in northern Jiangsu, with a flow rate of 700 cubic meters per second, which can maintain and develop 25 million mu of paddy fields. In terms of navigation projects, the Huai River has been an important waterway transportation route since ancient times, but it is hindered by Hongze Lake, and ships from the Grand Canal to the Huai River cannot directly reach it. In addition, the navigation of slightly larger tonnage ships is limited by the lower low-water flow and the irregular river channel. In the future, after water is stored in the upper and middle reaches, the normal medium-water flow can be greatly increased, and the river channel will also be regulated and necessary ship locks will be built. The Huai River can become an important waterway directly reaching Henan from the Yangtze River, supplementing the Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai railways, and making a significant contribution to the exchange of materials. Although the slope drop in the Huai River basin is relatively gentle and there are no high mountains and deep valleys, the valley reservoirs and the dams built along the river can also obtain a part of hydropower generation to supply the needs of farmland irrigation and electricity for small cities.

(5) Mass Long-Term Projects

Regarding the comprehensive development of the Huai River basin, in addition to the main projects mentioned above, there is another type of work that needs to be carried out by the masses for a long time. The first is water and soil conservation work, that is, afforestation, planting grass, improving farming methods, intercepting water and retaining silt, building valley dikes to block sand, and managing ditches and gullies in mountainous areas to prevent water and soil erosion, reduce the sand content of river water, and prevent mountain torrent disasters. The second is the ditch project, that is, the planned excavation of ditches in sloping water areas, so that waterlogging and accumulated water can be stored or discharged in time. The third is to carry out land leveling and the excavation of branch canals and small canals in coordination with the construction of large irrigation projects to fully exert the irrigation benefits of the main channels. In the past, those who paid attention to water conservancy knew that these tasks were fundamental and effective methods of water control. However, because agricultural production in the past was scattered, unorganized, and without leadership, the landlord class was extravagant and had no intention of developing and managing the land to make the most of its resources. The peasants were subjected to feudal exploitation and had no power to improve the land management. Therefore, these methods were generally considered to be just empty talk and could not be realized. Now, land reform has been implemented in most parts of the country, and the peasants' production enthusiasm is extremely high. The Communist Party's organization and the people's government in rural areas are playing a great organizational and promoting role in agricultural production. For these tasks, if they can be combined with the interests of the masses and local experience and widely promoted, because the projects are simple and easy, development can be extremely rapid. Tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of ponds and dams will have benefits no less than those of several large reservoirs, and tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of ditches and gullies will have benefits no less than those of several lake flood storage projects. The power of the masses is the great and endless source of power, and we must give enough attention to the leadership of this aspect of work.

(V) This is Just the First Step in New China's Water Conservancy Construction

The path of economic development in New China is to first open up a vast domestic market with unlimited potential to stimulate the rapid development of industrial production. The universal improvement of the purchasing power of the 400 million agricultural population is a huge and incomparable force to stimulate industrial development. Therefore, at this stage, developing agriculture has an extremely important prior role in developing industry. After the land reform, the peasants have become the masters of the land; developing water conservancy undertakings has become one of the important links in guaranteeing and increasing agricultural production. Due to the development of water conservancy projects towards "multi-objective", it also plays a direct role in promoting the country's industrialization and electrification. Fundamentally controlling the Huai River is the first great construction we have carried out in this regard, followed by more construction with more far-reaching impact and larger scale!

    把淮河千年的水患变成永远的水利
    中央水利部治淮通讯组
    （一）新淮河流域的美好远景
    根治淮河的第一年工程已经在汛期以前胜利完成。已完成的部分工程，就已经起了很大作用，保证了淮河流域今年夏秋两季的丰收。从根治淮河的全部计划来看，淮河流域的远景更是无限美好的。
    根治淮河是一个改变淮河流域自然面貌的伟大的具有历史意义的斗争。在全部工程完成以后，首先是可以保证整个淮河流域永远免除洪水的威胁，其中有四千万亩以上的土地，可以因新办的工程而获得灌溉，每年增加百分之五十以上的收益。按过去淮河流域水灾的纪录约略估计，平均每年的损失在六百万亩左右。每亩的收获量最低按一百斤计算，做了上述的工程，每年防洪的效益，可以增产粮食六亿斤；每年灌溉的效益，按每亩增产五十斤计算，可以增产粮食二十亿斤。淮河的航道运输，与运河、长江相联接，汽船的航行可以自河南、皖北的腹地，直达上海，并且在京汉铁路、津浦铁路间，增加一条横贯的交通要道。因为水道运输是运价最廉的运输方法，对物资交流，将有极大的贡献。农田水利工程和发电站的大量兴建，自然对于全流域农工业的发展，也有重要的辅助作用。
    （二）旧淮河流域的基本情况
    但是旧淮河的面貌是怎样的呢？谁都知道：过去多少年来，淮河和它的支流成了河南、皖北、苏北人民的大灾难。根据不完全的记载，从公元前二四六年到公元后一九四八年，大约两千年间，曾发生较大的水灾九百七十九次。从一八五五年到一九四八年，九十年间，曾发生较大的水灾共十四次，其中一九二一年淹地四千九百万亩，一九三一年淹地七千七百万亩。一九五○年淮河流域完全解放不到一年，因遭遇特大洪水，也曾发生严重水灾一次，受灾土地连轻重灾计算在内共四千三百五十万亩，就皖北来说，受灾土地就占全区耕田面积百分之六十。经人民政府大力抢救，皖北人民才得度过了灾荒。
    淮河流域所以这样容易发生灾害，一方面固然是自然条件所造成，主要的还是因为中国社会长期停滞在封建社会和半殖民地半封建的社会阶段，特别是国民党反动派统治期间，统治阶级忽视甚至破坏水利事业，因而造成了严重的恶果。
    淮河的自然条件，本来就容易发生水灾的。淮河发源于河南的桐柏山区，流经河南、皖北、苏北三个省区而入长江，全长约一千一百多公里，流域面积（不包括沂沭河区）约二十一万平方公里。就流域面积和支流的数目来做比例，淮河的支流比中国其他河流数目特多，而且排比的非常密集。在河南、皖北两省区，直接入淮的较大的支流就有二十九条，较小的支流，总数在一百八十条以上。所以只要河南、皖北有几个地区同时发生暴雨，就会有多数支流同时涨水，汇流而成异常巨大的洪水，为淮河干流所不能容泄。淮河的干流，河槽容量不足，河床坡度平缓。就河槽容量来说，按一九二一年、一九三一年和一九五○年的大水计算，淮河干流的河槽在许多河段只能容泄最大洪水的二分之一，并且在凤台的峡山口、蚌埠的铁桥和五河的浮山，还有严重的卡水现象。就河床的坡度来说，洪河口以上是万分之一的坡度，洪河口至正阳关是五万分之一的坡度，正阳关到盱眙是九万分之一的坡度。由于下游的坡度特别平缓，洪水下泄的时期因而延长，不但增加各个支流洪水相遇的机会，容易造成较大的洪水峰，同时因为淮河干流长期保持较高的水位，也影响支流及内地雨水的宣泄。
    黄河夺淮，对于淮河流域行水系统曾有严重的破坏。按一般情况，较大的河流之间，往往有山岭分隔，做为两个流域的分界线。可是在京汉路以东，黄河与淮河之间，却是一个北高南低，坡度约六千分之一至七千分之一的倾斜面。因之历史上只要黄河南岸决口，总是以淮河流域为其浊流泛滥的归宿。时间最长的一次是一一九四年到一八五五年（即南宋光宗绍熙五年到清咸丰五年），六百六十一年间，黄河从现在的洪泽湖以下夺占了淮河入海的河道（淮河原来是由现在的“废黄河”道，在苏北的云梯关入海）。这个重大的变化，给淮河流域造成几种严重的恶果：（一）淮河下游受黄河顶托，泄水不畅，水流泛滥，把原来的富陵湖、白水塘、破釜塘，扩大成现在的洪泽湖，做为停潴荡漾的场所。明清两代治淮的主要方策，又是有意地利用洪泽湖蓄水，以冲刷黄河的泥沙，于是不但使洪泽湖的面积日益扩大，水位日益壅高，而且洪泽湖以上的淮河干流，也受湖水的顶托，坡降逐渐变缓，水位逐渐抬高，更增加支流洪水排泄的困难；在洪水特别大时，若干支流并受淮河干流的倒灌。（二）淮河的入海水道受黄河淤垫，逐渐抬高，泄水更不通畅，于是淮河就从洪泽湖南下，经过高邮宝应等湖流入长江。在一八五五年黄河改道到山东入海以后，淮河入海水道，完全淤塞，只剩下入江一条出路。一九三八年蒋介石匪帮在河南花园口，罪恶地挖掘黄河堤防，是黄河最近一次侵入淮河。这一次黄河夺淮，因为是从淮河的上中游流入，影响所及的范围更为广阔。在河南淤平了很多较小的支流。使雨水不能宣泄，造成严重的涝灾，在皖北淤塞了很多较大支流入淮的口门，使支流洪水排泄不畅，并且淮河的干流在许多地方也被淤高很多。试举蚌埠为例，一九五○年比一九三一年流量小三百秒立方公尺，而水位却高零点九八公尺，河床淤高的情形可以想见。
    综合以上的情况，已经可以说明，淮河流域所以时常发生水灾是上中下游全面的问题，绝对不是局部的整理所能解决。可是过去的封建统治阶级眼光局限于自私的局部的利益，对于淮河的治理，永远没有做过而且也不可能做出通盘的规划。反之，却有时实行“以邻为壑”的罪恶的政策，因之造成了上中下游之间尖锐的对立，上游对中游，中游对下游，只考虑怎样把洪水排泄下去，却没有考虑过对方能否容纳。中游对上游，下游对中游，只考虑怎样阻止洪水的下泄，没有考虑过对方的灾害。同时对于自己地区以内洪水的防范，也只是盲目地筑堤防水，没有研究过上游究竟可能有多少洪水下来，两堤之间的河槽究竟能不能容泄。有些贪婪自私的地主，甚至在河心里建筑圈堤，或围垦蓄水的湖泊，只顾自己的利益，完全不顾别人的安全。像这样支离割裂的治理，和他们所遗留下来的有些建筑物，不但对治河无益，而且加重了淮河的灾患。这是淮河流域的又一个情况。
    各河的上游，因为山林遭受破坏，不能涵蓄水流，经常因山洪暴发而造成灾害；全流域全年的雨量分配不匀，雨季容易发生水灾，到农田用水的时候，却又感到水量不足。这些也都是治理淮河所必须考虑的重要问题。
    （三）治理淮河的新方针
    根据以上的情况，中央人民政府政务院在一九五○年十月发布的治理淮河的决定中，提出以“蓄泄兼筹”作为治理淮河的方针。为了实现这个方针，又提出两项重要的原则，一个是上中下游统筹兼顾，一个是以防洪为主。要首先做到根除水患，同时结合灌溉、航运、发电的需要，逐渐达到多目标的流域开发。
    这个方针，不但完全符合淮河流域的实际情况，使根治淮河的工程的实现有了重要的保证，而且标志出人民时代和过去反动统治时代在治河的思想与技术上的基本区别。
    在反动统治时期，治水的工作，因受封建制度和反动统治阶级的阶级利益的限制，对于一个河流的治理，往往是从一个地区统治阶级一时的利益出发，只看见一个地区的利益，看不见全流域互相关联的其他地区的利益；对于雨量水情，缺乏全面的系统的了解，因此多数工程都带着极大的局部性、盲目性和片面性，虽然耗费很多人力、物力，却不能真正解决问题。对这些落后的错误的治河办法来说，政务院所提出的蓄泄兼筹的方针，在治河的思想上，是一个重大的革命。所谓蓄泄兼筹，包括几个重要的意义：首先是照顾整体，反对局部的观点。一个河流的上中下游，息息相关，不可分割，必须就全流域做通盘的规划，才能澈底解决问题，一切枝枝节节的治理必然造成各地区间的对立和矛盾。其次，是提出了蓄水的方法，和泄水方法配合运用，以扩大治水兴利的道路，使水利事业可能做到多目标互相结合，达到最经济最有利于生产的结果。只要对于全流域水源的供给和需求，做了全面的调查分析，自然就会看出，水虽然在没有加以控制的时候可以为害，可是只要善加控制，全部可以变成有利于生产的可贵的资源。在一年中多雨的时期，水量虽然好像过多，可是到用水的时候，水量却又大感不足；所以对于水流的处理，就不应当单纯的讲求排泄，把水流白白地送到海里，而是要在洪水时期利用一切可以利用的湖泊、洼地，和人工制造的水库、沟洫、塘埧，把水暂时地存蓄起来，以避免下游的灾害；等洪水过后，再慢慢地放出来，以供给航运、灌溉、发电的需要。天然的水流，到来的时间和水流的数量，是人力所不能控制的，因此我们对于水的利用有其一定限度；有了蓄水的方法，水流的下泄，可以完全听命于我们意志的支配，于是利用水流来发展生产的道路，就更为广阔，寓除害于兴利，举办一个工程就可得到最经济的效果。不过，淮河的水流，即使经过大量蓄水以后，整个的河道系统还必须经过一番整理疏浚，才能保障安全，并供航运灌溉排水的利用。毫无疑问，蓄泄兼筹是治理淮河最正确的方针。
    （四）治理淮河的全部规划
    根据蓄泄兼筹的方针和淮河流域的情况，治理淮河的全部规划，包括下述几项主要的工程：第一是巨大的蓄水工程。上中游要蓄水一百二十亿立方公尺，以免除淮河泛滥的灾害，并供给全流域各种兴利事业的利用。第二是干支流的河道整理工程，使蓄水以后的淮河，成为排水顺畅、航运发达的河流。第三是淮河与洪泽湖分开的工程，使洪泽湖对淮河干流发挥更大的调节洪水的作用，并用湖内的蓄水，维持和发展苏北两千五百万亩的农田灌溉。至于一九五○年十月政务院治淮决定曾提出开辟“入海水道”，是由于当时全流域的调查工作，尚未全部完成，对于上中游蓄水的可能的容量，还没有做出全面的精确的估计，所以考虑到开辟入海水道，以排泄拦蓄以后过量的洪水。现在上中游蓄水的容量，已经大为提高，入海水道便无须再行开辟。这一个变动更增加了蓄水工程在治淮工程的重要性，但其基本精神，仍然和政务院决定的方针完全一致。以下就是这个全部规划的轮廓。
    （1）淮河流域最大水量的估定和它的分配
    关于淮河流域总的水量，根据历年的雨量和水文资料，特别是一九二一、一九三一、和一九五○年三个水灾最大的洪水年份的各项资料，推算估定，考虑到工程的安全和工程的经济，估计在汛期一百五十天内，流经中渡（洪泽湖出口）的可能的最大的洪水总量为七百六十亿立方公尺。我们就把这个数字用做治淮的计划洪水总量。对于这个洪水总量的分配，根据我们在淮河上中游查勘所得可能用以拦蓄洪水的水库地址和湖泊洼地的蓄水数量，配合上中下游防洪灌溉航运发电的需要，和现有河道加以整理以后可能的泄水的情况，我们认为对于这样巨量的洪水，要分别按以下办法处理，就可以完全免除洪水的灾害：上游河南境内要做到有效蓄洪三十五亿立方公尺，中游皖北境内要做到有效蓄洪八十五亿立方公尺。经过这样拦蓄以后，淮河在正阳关的最大洪水流量就可以不超过五千五百秒立方公尺，东淝河口的流量可以不超过五千秒立方公尺，与涡河会合以后，蚌埠的流量可以不超过七千秒立方公尺，与宿县专区各支流会合以后，浮山流量可不超过八千七百秒立方公尺，连同直接流入洪泽湖的各河一并计算，洪泽湖以上的最大流量可不超过一万一千四百秒立方公尺。经过洪泽湖的调节，并从洪泽湖向东直达于海，开辟一条灌溉渠道，分泄七百秒立方公尺，洪泽湖以下由三河入江的流量，就可以不超过七千秒立方公尺。按照这个标准，一般就可以完全免除水灾。
    （2）配合这个水量的分配必须进行的蓄水的工程
    配合这个水量的分配，在上游河南境内，为了蓄洪三十五亿立方公尺，要修建山谷水库共十三处，就是淮河本源的大坡岭水库、南湾水库，独树村水库，潢河上游的龙山水库，洪、汝河水系上游的薄山水库、石漫滩水库、板桥水库，灌河上游的盛家店水库、鲇鱼山水库，颍河水系上游的下汤水库、曹楼水库、紫罗山水库、白沙水库。另外举办潼湖、吴宋湖、老王坡、蛟停湖等四处湖泊洼地蓄洪工程。在中游皖北境内，为了蓄洪八十五亿立方公尺，要修建山谷水库共三处，就是史河上游的梅山水库，淠河上游的佛子岭水库、长竹园水库。主要是举办蒙河洼地，润河洼地，霍邱城西湖、城东湖、邱家湖、姜家湖、唐垛湖、孟家湖、焦岗湖、瓦埠湖等十余处湖泊洼地蓄洪工程。其中尤以城西湖的蓄洪容量最大，可达二十七亿五千万立方公尺。为了灵活操纵水流的蓄泄，充分发挥蓄洪工程的效能，在润河集淮河干流上修筑一个巨大的控制工程。这个控制工程分三个部分，就是固定河槽，拦河闸和进湖闸。普通水流可从固定河槽流到下游，作为常年畅通的河道，遇见较大的洪水，则可以酌量上下游的情况，利用拦河闸和进湖闸的启闭，或者把水放到下游，或者把水蓄入湖内，做为洪泽湖以上淮河干流具有关键性的操纵机构。
    这些蓄洪的工程，都是以防洪为主，同时照顾了灌溉的需要。山谷蓄洪之外，湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，则是根据淮河流域的特殊情况而产生的工程。因为淮河流域一部分河流发源于西部南部的山区，一部分河流是自黄淮之间的坡地流出，山谷水库因为受地形的限制，不能控制全部水流，再加上坡地的水流，下泄的流量还是很大的，修建水库以后仍然不是河槽所能容纳，必须利用湖泊洼地作为蓄水的补助工程。在皖北，湖泊蓄水更是蓄洪的主要方式。皖北现有的终年积水的湖泊洼地，除洪泽湖外，总面积约三千平方公里。这些湖泊大抵和河流相通，自然而然地对河流起着一定的调节作用；不过因为没有控制，常年积水，不能充分发挥蓄洪的效能，里面的农产也十年九淹，不能保证一定的收成。现在加以整理控制，使普通洪水不能流入，等遇着较大的洪水才放水入湖。这样一来，因为平时干涸，湖内没有存水，蓄洪的效能可以大为增加；又因为湖内水量的蓄泄有了管制，汛后把积水排出，春季使水流不能侵入，湖内还可涸出一部分土地保证一季的麦收。在全部治淮计划中，蓄水总量共一百二十亿立方公尺（洪泽湖在外），山谷水库仅占三十多亿，湖泊洼地蓄洪总量约占八十多亿，可见这一类工程在整个治淮工程中的重要作用。
    （3）结合蓄洪工程必须进行的河道整理工程
    淮河流域可能发生的最大的洪水，经过以上有计划地拦蓄以后，淮河干流各段的流量，都有了可以推算出来的最高的限制，于是我们就可根据各段的计划洪水流量，整理改善各段的河槽，包括进行必要的修堤、疏浚、开挖引河和部分的改道工程。其中较重要的，在上游河南境内，对洪河口一段淮河干流要进行整理，以解除潢川专区的涝灾；对汝河洪河颍河和黄泛区各河，要疏浚河槽，放宽堤距，修复堤防，使能够安全宣泄蓄洪以后的上游来水和当地的雨水。在中游皖北境内，要加强正阳关至五河一段的堤防，以巩固河道的安全；要疏浚淤塞的支流，特别是阜阳专区和宿县专区的重要支流，以解决内地雨水的排泄问题。
    在河道整理中最大的工程，是五河以下的淮河干流的治理，五河以下淮河干流，因为流经洪泽湖内，几百年来受洪泽湖停潴的影响，使淮河干流水位过高，在洪水时期影响支流洪水的排泄，有时并且发生倒灌。洪泽湖因为没有控制，也不能充分发挥蓄洪的作用。对于这一段河流的治理，有两个较大的工程，第一是内外水分流：就是在五河到浮山段，使内地雨水排泄的水道和淮河干流分开，使内水的排泄，不受淮河干流的影响，以解决宿县专区严重的内涝问题。（确定内河水位在五河不超过一六·五公尺，在浮山不超过一五·五公尺。淮河干流的水位，浮山暂定为一七·五公尺，将来利用水流冲刷并加疏浚，争取达到一五·五公尺）第二是洪泽湖和淮河分开：就是淮河干流要在盱眙以下开挖一条引河，撇开洪泽湖，直通三河，经高宝等湖以入长江，并在淮河和洪泽湖间修筑入湖和出湖的闸坝，加以节制，使淮河成为独立的河道，洪泽湖成为有控制的水库。这样则淮河干流的水流下泄较快，上中游，干支河，排泄洪水的时间容易掌握调节，淮河河槽排洪的效能可以大为提高。行水顺畅，河槽容易自然刷深，加以整理即可成为一个条件优越的航道系统。洪泽湖因为有了控制，平时流入的内水，还可从苏北灌溉渠道和通往淮河的水闸泄出一部，蓄洪容量必然大为提高，对于防洪和灌溉都有极大的利益。
    （4）关于灌溉、航运、发电工程的规划
    前面已经提到，淮河流域的水灾虽然十分严重，可是到干旱季节却又处处感到水量不足，单靠降雨和淮河的自然流量，完全不能满足农田灌溉的需要。低水年份，航道运输也要发生严重问题。所以治理淮河的规划，必须要把汛期较大的水量大部地存蓄起来，以应付干旱时期的需要。按前面所说蓄水工程所蓄的水量，配合各地地形和农田用水的情况计算，关于淮河流域灌溉工程的规划，上游水库蓄水三十五亿立方公尺，可以发展水田六百至九百万亩，中游湖泊洼地蓄水如果再加以利用，也可以发展水田一千万亩左右，洪泽湖与淮河分开以后，蓄水约四十亿立方公尺，在苏北开辟一道入海的灌溉渠道，流量七百秒立方公尺，可以维持并发展水田二千五百万亩。关于航道工程方面，淮河自古就是水路交通的要道，不过因受洪泽湖的阻滞，从运河到淮河船只不能直达，另外受低水流量较低和河槽不规则的影响，吨位稍大的船只航行也受有限制，将来上中游蓄水以后，平常的中水流量可以大为增加，河道亦将加以整理，并修建必要的船闸。淮河就可成为从长江直达河南，与京汉、津浦、陇海铁路相辅而行的重要航道，对物资交流有重大的贡献。淮河流域虽然坡降较缓，没有高山深谷，可是山谷水库和沿河所修的闸坝，也可获得一部分水力发电，以供应农田灌溉和小城市用电的需要。
    （5）群众性的长期的工程
    关于淮河流域的全面开发，除去上面所说的主要工程以外，还有另外一类要由群众长期进行的工作。第一是水土保持工作，就是在山地造林，种草，改良耕种方法，截水留淤，谷坊拦沙及沟壑治理等等，以防止水土的流失，减少河水的含沙量，并防止山洪暴发的灾害。第二是沟洫工程，就是在坡水地区有计划地开挖沟渠，使内涝积水，能够有所容蓄，或者及时排泄。第三是配合大的灌溉工程的兴筑，进行土地的平治和支渠小渠的开挖，以求充分发挥主要渠道的灌溉效益。这些工作在过去凡是讲求水利的，都知道是一种根本的有效的治水的方法。可是因为过去的农业生产是散漫的，无组织无领导的，地主阶级骄奢淫佚，无意于开发经营，以尽地力，农民受着封建性的剥削，没有力量改善土地的经营，所以一般认为这些办法只是纸上谈兵，无法实现。现在全国大部地区已经实行土地改革，农民的生产情绪极为高涨，农村里共产党的组织和人民政权，对农业生产起着极大的组织推动作用。对这些工作，若能结合群众的利益和当地的经验，普遍地推广起来，因为工程简易，发展可以极为迅速。有几万个、几十万个塘埧，其效益不下于若干大型水库，几万条、几十万条沟洫，其效益不下于若干湖泊蓄洪工程。群众的力量是伟大的无尽的力量的源泉，我们对这一方面工作的领导必须给予足够的重视。
    （五）这不过是新中国水利建设的第一步
    新中国经济发展的道路，是要首先开辟广大的具有无限潜力的国内市场，以刺激工业生产的迅速发展，四万万农业人口购买力的普遍提高，就是刺激工业发展的巨大无比的力量，因此，在现阶段，发展农业对于发展工业具有着极端重要的先行的作用。在土地改革以后，农民已经作了土地的主人；发展水利事业，就成为保障和增加农业生产的重要环节之一。由于水利工程向“多目标”的发展，它对于国家的工业化、电气化，还起着直接的推动作用。根治淮河是我们在这一方面所进行的第一个伟大的建设，跟着来的将是影响更为深远，规模更为巨大的更多的建设！（附图片）
