    To the Editor:
    What farmer Fu Jinlong of our district stated in his letter is indeed factual. He enthusiastically reported a bandit but was instead detained by the Zhumadian City Public Security Bureau and made to grind wheat in a labor team for five days. Later, when our county's Public Security Bureau went to escort the bandit leader Feng Guobin, he was released. At that time, Fu Jinlong was seriously ill and had to return by carriage. We sent a doctor to treat him, and he gradually recovered. We hope you can help resolve this matter.
            The Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Pingyu County, Henan Province

    Editor's Note: The Zhumadian City Public Security Bureau of Henan Province has taken a retaliatory attitude towards the just action of the masses in reporting counter-revolutionary criminals, detaining the masses who reported counter-revolutionary criminals in the labor team to grind wheat. This is an intolerable error. The Zhumadian City Public Security Bureau, using "who is responsible if we are wrong" as an excuse, wanted to release a counter-revolutionary criminal with many blood debts reported by the masses without any investigation. They arbitrarily violated human rights and detained the masses for no reason. They are responsible for suppressing counter-revolutionaries, but they are so indifferent to important counter-revolutionary cases. This shows how the responsible cadres of the bureau have lost their stand and how serious their bureaucratic style is. We hope that the relevant authorities will quickly investigate and deal with this matter in order to reverse the adverse effects it has caused.

### 中国共产党平舆县第八区委员会来信

专栏：读者来信

    中国共产党平舆县第八区委员会来信编辑同志：
    我区农民傅谨龙信中所述，确是事实。他热情检举土匪，反被驻马店市公安局扣押在劳动队内推磨五天。后来我县公安局去押解匪首冯国彬时，他才被放出来。那时傅谨龙身带重病，只得坐着马车回来。经我们派医生给他治疗，才逐渐治愈。这件事，希望你们帮助处理。
            中国共产党河南省平舆县第八区委员会
    编者按：河南省驻马店市公安局对群众检举反革命罪犯的正义行动采取了打击的态度，把检举反革命罪犯的群众扣押在劳动队推磨，这是不可容忍的错误行为。驻马店市公安局，以“错了谁负责”为藉口，未加任何调查，开始竟想释放群众所检举的、有很多血债的反革命罪犯；他们对待群众，却又任意侵犯人权，无故加以扣押。他们担任着镇压反革命的重任，却对重要的反革命案件这样不关心，说明该局负责干部是如何地丧失立场，官僚主义作风是何等严重。希望有关机关迅速检查处理这件事，以挽回它所造成的恶劣影响。
