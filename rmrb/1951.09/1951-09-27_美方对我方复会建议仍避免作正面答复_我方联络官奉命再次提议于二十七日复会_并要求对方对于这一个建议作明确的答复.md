Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th: This reporter learned from the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers that after our liaison officer, on September 25th, was ordered to propose to the other side that the representatives of both sides resume armistice negotiations in Kaesong at 10:00 a.m. on September 26th, the other side avoided giving a clear reply. Instead, at 6:30 p.m. on the 25th, they sent a letter from Colonel Kinney, the liaison officer of the other side, to Colonel Zhang Chunshan, our liaison officer, in which they claimed that they would come to meet with our liaison officer at 10:00 a.m. on the 26th to discuss the so-called conditions for resuming the negotiation meeting. Our liaison officer then sent a letter at 7:00 a.m. on the 26th (attached below) to the other side's liaison officer, requesting the other side to give a clear reply to our proposal that the representatives of both sides resume armistice negotiations at 10:00 a.m. on September 26th, and reiterated that our liaison officer was only authorized to discuss the date and time of resuming armistice negotiations. If the other side objected to the specific date and time proposed by our side, our liaison officer was prepared to continue discussing other dates and times for resuming the armistice negotiation meeting with the other side at 9:00 a.m. on September 26th. However, the other side still avoided giving a clear reply to our proposal, and only made excuses on the radio telephone, stating that they would not be able to arrive for the meeting at 9:00 a.m., and then claimed after 9:00 a.m. that they would still come to meet with our liaison officer at 10:00 a.m. Our side immediately stated that since the other side did not come to Kaesong at 9:00 a.m., our liaison officer would meet with the other side at 10:00 a.m. to discuss the date and time of the resumption of talks.
	At 10:00 a.m. on September 26th, after our liaison officer Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen met with the other side's liaison officer Colonel Kinney and Colonel Murray, Colonel Zhang Chunshan first questioned the other side: The other side has consistently refused to give a clear reply to our proposal for the representatives of both sides to resume negotiations at 10:00 a.m., does this indicate that the other side opposes the immediate resumption of armistice negotiations in Kaesong? However, Colonel Kinney still avoided giving a direct reply and once again raised the issue of conditions for resuming the meeting, claiming: General Ridgway had proposed three times in letters to General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai that the conditions for resuming the meeting should be discussed in the liaison officer meeting, but at the same time suggested a recess to wait for further instructions from higher authorities. Colonel Zhang Chunshan immediately pointed out that Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai had already replied to and refuted General Ridgway's proposal in letters to General Ridgway on September 19th and 24th, and clearly stated that the representatives of both delegations should immediately resume negotiations in Kaesong without having to discuss the conditions for resuming the meeting. Colonel Zhang Chunshan, according to the order of our chief representative, once again proposed that the delegations of both sides resume negotiations in Kaesong at 10:00 a.m. on September 27th, and demanded that the other side give a clear reply to this proposal. At the same time, it was pointed out that the other side's commander-in-chief should not avoid directly answering our commander's letter of September 24th, and continue to order his liaison officer to insist on the procedure that has been rejected by our commander, in order to delay the rapid resumption of armistice negotiations. Colonel Kinney replied: He is willing to convey our proposal to resume armistice negotiations at 10:00 a.m. on September 27th to his superiors. Finally, Colonel Zhang Chunshan pointed out that the other side's claim in its letter on the 25th that our liaison officer unilaterally announced the adjournment of the meeting on the morning of that day was completely inconsistent with the facts, and requested the other side to proofread the records after the adjournment. After Colonel Kinney agreed to exchange the records of the previous meeting between the two sides when the meeting resumed, the meeting ended at 11:10.
	Colonel Zhang Chunshan's letter to Colonel Kinney at 7:00 a.m. on the 26th is as follows:
	To Colonel Kinney, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command Delegation:
		I have received your letter of 6:30 p.m. on September 25th. I was ordered at the liaison officer meeting on September 25th to propose to your side to resume the armistice negotiation meeting at 10:00 a.m. on September 26th. Our representatives are prepared to meet with your representatives at the Kaesong venue at 10:00 a.m. on September 26, 1951. I await your reply to this proposal. As you know, my commander has suggested to your commander that our two delegations should immediately resume negotiations in Kaesong without having to discuss the conditions for resuming armistice negotiations, and I am only authorized to discuss with you the date and time of resuming the armistice negotiation meeting. If your side objects to resuming the armistice negotiation meeting at 10:00 a.m. on September 26th, please clearly inform me. I am prepared to continue discussing with you the revised date and time for resuming the armistice negotiation meeting at 9:00 a.m. on September 26th.
					Zhang Chunshan, Chief Liaison Officer of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation
					September 26, 1951

    美方对我方复会建议仍避免作正面答复
    我方联络官奉命再次提议于二十七日复会
    并要求对方对于这一个建议作明确的答复
    【新华社开城二十六日电】本社记者由朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团获悉：九月二十五日我方联络官奉命向对方提出双方代表在九月二十六日上午十时在开城恢复停战谈判的建议以后，对方避不明确答复，而在二十五日下午六时三十分送来对方联络官肯尼上校致我方联络官张春山上校函件一封，其中自称将在二十六日上午十时前来与我方联络官会晤，讨论所谓恢复谈判会议的条件的问题。我方联络官当在二十六日上午七时致函（附后）对方联络官，要求对方对于我方所提出的双方代表在九月二十六日上午十时恢复停战谈判的建议作一明确的答复，并再度指出我方联络官仅被授权讨论恢复停战谈判的日期和时间。如果对方反对我方所提议的具体日期与时间，我方联络官准备在九月二十六日上午九时与对方继续洽商恢复停战谈判会议的其他日期和时间。但对方仍然避免对我方的建议作明确的答复，而仅在无线电话中托辞表示九时不及赶来会晤，并在九时以后声称，仍将在十时前来与我方联络官会晤。我方当即声明，既然对方在九时未来开城，我方联络官将在十时与对方会晤讨论复会的日期与时间问题。
    九月二十六日上午十时，我方联络官张春山上校、柴成文中校与对方联络官肯尼上校、穆莱上校会晤以后，张春山上校首先向对方质问：对方对于我方在上午十时双方代表恢复谈判的建议始终拒绝作明确答复，是否表示对方反对立即在开城恢复停战谈判？但肯尼上校仍然避免作正面答复，而再度提出复会条件问题，声称：李奇微将军曾在致金日成将军与彭德怀将军的信件中，三次提出联络官会议中应该讨论复会条件问题，但同时又建议休会，以等候上级进一步指示。张春山上校当即指出金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员已在九月十九日及二十四日两次致李奇微将军的函件中，答复并驳斥了李奇微将军的建议，并明白声明双方代表团应即恢复在开城的谈判而无须再去讨论复会的条件。张春山上校根据我方首席代表的命令，再次提议双方代表团在九月二十七日上午十时在开城恢复谈判，并要求对方对于这一建议作一明确的答复。同时提出对方总司令不应避免正面回答我方司令官九月二十四日的函件，而继续命令其联络官坚持已被我方司令官所否定的程序，以拖延停战谈判的迅速恢复。肯尼上校答称：愿将我方所提出的在九月二十七日十时恢复停战谈判的建议转达上级。最后，张春山上校指出对方在二十五日的来函中所称我方联络官在当日上午的会谈中片面宣布散会根本与事实不符，要求对方在散会后校对记录。在肯尼上校同意以后开会时交换双方上次会议的记录后，会议在十一时十分结束。
    张春山上校二十六日七时致肯尼上校函如下：
    联合国军代表团首席联络官肯尼上校：
    九月二十五日下午六时半函悉。我已于九月二十五日联络官会议上，奉命向你方建议于九月二十六日上午十时恢复停战谈判会议，我方代表准备在一九五一年九月二十六日上午十时在开城会场与你方代表会晤。我等待你方对于这个建议的答复。如你所知，我的司令官已向你的总司令建议你我双方代表团应即恢复在开城的谈判，无须再去讨论恢复停战谈判的条件，而我只被授权和你洽商恢复停战谈判会议的日期和时间。如你方反对在九月二十六日上午十时恢复停战谈判会议，请你明确告我，我准备在九月二十六日上午九时和你继续洽商恢复停战谈判会议的改动日期和时间。	朝鲜人民军中国人民志愿军代表团首席联络官张春山上校		    一九五一年九月二十六日
