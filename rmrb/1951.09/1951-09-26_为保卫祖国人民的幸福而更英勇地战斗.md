Volunteer Army Returning Representative, Combat Hero of a Certain Unit, Wang Yougen

	Having returned from Korea, I, along with several other Volunteer Army Returning Representatives, traveled to various parts of the motherland. What I saw of our motherland was truly a vast and resource-rich country. We traversed the Hebei Plain twice. The first time, we saw wheat fields stretching as far as the eye could see, and the second time, we saw cotton fields stretching as far as the eye could see, as boundless as the sea we saw in Qingdao. When the wind blew, the wheat swayed like waves on the sea, which was truly exhilarating. In the various mines, we saw abundant coal and iron. On the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, we saw countless horses, cattle, sheep, and camels. The population of the motherland is also increasing rapidly. According to statistics from Chongqing, 80,000 babies were born last year alone, an average increase of six or seven people per hundred. Our motherland is truly prosperous in both people and resources!

	The prosperous motherland I saw is vastly different from what it was before I went abroad. Many factories have been restored, and several new factories have been built. Most of the railways have been repaired, and new railways are also under construction. Cities and villages are more lively than before. Prices are basically stable, and the lives of the worker and peasant brothers have improved. People who couldn't even afford clothes or enough food in the past can now afford to buy a flashlight or a bicycle. They are also dressed neatly. Since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, order has been particularly good everywhere. Disasters have also decreased in various places. Land reform will be basically completed after the efforts this winter and next spring. Under the leadership of our leader Chairman Mao, our motherland is changing with each passing day.

	I was particularly moved by the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement in our motherland. The people of the motherland are working hard on all fronts to support the Korean front. Worker comrades have launched patriotic production competitions. Comrade Ma Wanshui, a nationally renowned labor model, is an excellent iron ore miner. In January of this year, he could only dig six meters on a four-meter-wide face; in April of this year, he dug forty-five meters on the same width face, an increase of 650 percent over the past. Peasant comrades carried out patriotic high-yield movements, some proposing to add fifty loads of manure per mu this year and deliver two more dou of grain to the state. Women compatriots also enthusiastically launched a patriotic production upsurge, actively participating in various sideline productions and organizing sewing groups, laundry groups, and profitable donation groups. Women compatriots in Hefei also cultivated the very small piece of land in their courtyards to grow vegetables and sunflowers, and put forward the slogan "Sell eggs to buy shells." Young comrades donated blood to Volunteer Army wounded and sick and registered in large numbers to participate in military cadre schools. Other sectors such as the business community, education sector, literary and art circles, religious circles, and various ethnic groups also played their due roles in the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement and the donation of airplanes and cannons movement. Truly, regardless of men and women, young and old, regardless of religious beliefs, all ethnic groups and all classes are resisting America and aiding Korea. This unprecedentedly united and consolidated powerful force will defeat any fierce enemy. We feel that with our 475 million compatriots standing behind us, we have no difficulties that cannot be overcome and will be invincible.

	Our great motherland's people have expressed unlimited love for the Volunteer Army. Some gave us their most cherished possessions, allowing us to bring their sincere thoughts and hopes to the Korean front. Some, after hearing our reports, insisted on following us to Korea. In Zhangjiakou, 771 young students requested to go to the Korean front with us. After we return to Korea, we must tell all the commanders and fighters about these situations, so that we can answer the motherland's love with more determined combat and greater victories to defend the safety and happiness of the motherland's people!

    为保卫祖国人民的幸福而更英勇地战斗
    志愿军归国代表、某部战斗英雄  王有根
    我从朝鲜回来，和几位志愿军归国代表曾来往祖国各地，我所见到的我们的祖国，真是一个辽阔广大，物产丰富的国家。我们在河北平原上来回走过两次，第一次看到了望不见边的麦田，第二次又看到了望不见边的棉田，就像我们在青岛看见的海那样一望无际。风一吹来，麦浪滚滚，像海里的波浪一样，真使人兴奋。在各矿山，看到丰富的煤、铁，在内蒙古草原上，看到数不清的马、牛、羊和骆驼。祖国各地的人口，也增加得很快。根据重庆市的材料，去年一年中就增添了八万个婴儿，平均每一百个人当中，增加了六、七口人。我们的祖国，真正是人财旺盛啊！
    我所看到的我们繁荣的祖国，和出国以前比较是大不相同了。许多工厂都恢复起来了，并且还建筑了若干新工厂。铁路大都修通了，新的铁路也在建筑中。城市和乡村都比以前热闹了。物价基本上稳定，工人、农民弟兄们的生活都改善了。过去连衣服穿不上，饭都吃不饱的人，现在有的能够有钱来买个手电筒，买个自行车了。衣服也都穿得整齐了。从镇压反革命以后，各地的秩序特别好。各地方的灾荒也减少了。土地改革，再经过今冬和明春的努力，就基本完成了。我们的祖国在我们的领袖毛主席领导下，正在日新月异地变化。
    我特别看到我们祖国轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝爱国运动，是那样令人感动。祖国的人民群众，在各个战线上，努力支援着朝鲜前线。工人同志们，开展了爱国主义的生产竞赛。著名全国的劳动模范马万水同志，是一个优秀的采铁矿工。今年一月间，他还只能在四公尺宽正面掘进六公尺；今年四月他在同样宽的正面掘进了四十五公尺，比以前提高了百分之六百五十。农民同志们进行了爱国主义丰产运动，有的提出今年每亩地要多上五十担粪，多打二斗粮食交给国家。妇女同胞们，也热烈地掀起了爱国增产热潮，纷纷参加了各种副业生产，组织缝纫小组、洗衣小组，保本生利捐献。合肥市的妇女同胞们把院子里很小的一块土地，也都开出来种菜，种向日葵，并提出“卖了鸡蛋买炮弹”的口号。青年同志们，给志愿军伤病员输血，大量地报名参加军事干部学校。其它如工商界、教育界、文艺界、宗教界和各兄弟民族，也都在抗美援朝爱国运动和捐献飞机大炮运动中，起了应有的作用。真是不分男女老少，不分宗教信仰，各民族、各阶层、人人都在抗美援朝。这种空前团结，空前巩固的强大力量，就会战胜任何凶恶的敌人。我们感到有祖国这样四亿七千五百万同胞站在我们后面，我们就没有克服不了的困难，就会是天下无敌的。
    我们伟大的祖国人民对于志愿军表示了无限的热爱，他们有的把最心爱的东西，送给了我们，让我们把他们的诚恳的心意和希望，带到朝鲜前线，有的听到我们的报告以后，就非要跟着我们到朝鲜不可。在张家口，就有七百七十一个青年学生要求和我们一同到朝鲜前线去。我们回到朝鲜以后，一定要把这些情况，告诉给全体指战员同志，让我们为保卫祖国人民的安全和幸福，以更坚决的战斗和更大的胜利，来回答祖国人民的热爱吧！
