    Patriotic Pact Improves My Leadership Work
    Huang Zheng, Director of Jinzhou Textile Factory, Dalian
    In June of this year, the key leading cadres of our factory's Party, government, labor union, and youth league, when discussing how to lead the patriotic pact campaign throughout the factory, proposed: In order to lead the campaign, we must personally participate in it. This is because: First, although our leading cadres all have the desire to improve leadership work, there are still considerable differences in everyone's views and requirements, and it is necessary to formulate a pact to unify understanding and propose clear goals for struggle; second, in order to lead the patriotic pact campaign well, leading cadres should lead by example. Therefore, several of our main leaders formulated a patriotic pact. It was revised once in early August.
    In formulating and implementing the patriotic pact, I deeply felt the role of the patriotic pact in improving leadership work. For three or four years, my method of inspecting workshops was always a superficial tour, spending one or two hours looking at the whole factory, generally without going deep. In July, I implemented the patriotic pact and resolved to spend a whole day each week in one workshop or one group to understand the work of one workshop or the work of one group. The first thing I understood was the maintenance of Platt flat carding machines in the carding workshop. The problems discovered therein were generally present in the common workshops throughout the factory. This provided specific experience and methods for solving this important production problem. Secondly, for three or four years, I have not made the four main departments that control output, quality, and cost – the planning section, accounting section, inspection section, and engineer's office – into my flexible and powerful assistants. In July, I established a system where these four departments reported to me every Wednesday afternoon. At the meeting, we either studied and solved one or two problems related to output, quality, and cost, or I assigned work. In this way, I took unified control of the four departments and improved my leadership work.
    In August, in the implementation of the patriotic pact, I formulated a monthly meeting plan based on the central work of the month, overcoming the shortcomings of not being able to carefully consider the content of the meeting in advance in the past. In the past, I also attached importance to propaganda and mobilization work. I had made suggestions and criticisms when the labor union's weekly "Jin Textile Worker" and blackboard newspaper were not run well, but I did not actively provide assistance, as if that was enough. Starting in August, I proposed to write an article for the "Jin Textile Worker" every week, and also planned to write an article for the Dalian People's Daily, donating the manuscript fee. In this way, the patriotic pact enabled me to take a step further in attaching importance to propaganda and mobilization work.
    After this period of practice, my understanding of the patriotic pact became clearer. When we first signed the pact, several of our leaders still held the idea of ​​"trying it out," and some people still felt that "it's the same to do work whether you sign it or not," and "do our leading cadres still need to sign it?" But before the revision in August, we had unanimously recognized the role of the patriotic pact. At present, we feel that it is very necessary to sign a patriotic pact, which can help us overcome our shortcomings very well. Because the patriotic pact is serious and can restrain and supervise oneself. For example, in the first pact I signed, I stipulated that I should write an article summarizing the experience of maintaining Platt flat carding machines. Although I was very busy, I felt that it was wrong not to implement things stipulated in the patriotic pact, so I took the time to write it. After we signed the first patriotic pact, we conducted an inspection. This was necessary and played a role in mutual supervision.
    Facts have proved that the patriotic pact of leading cadres is not only a powerful weapon for improving leadership work, but also directly affects the patriotic pact campaign of the masses. Therefore, leading cadres should not only formulate patriotic pacts, but also formulate them well, implement them well, and strictly inspect them, so as to set an example for the masses.

### 爱国公约改进了我的领导工作

    爱国公约改进了我的领导工作
    旅大金州纺织厂厂长  黄正
    今年六月里，我厂党、政、工、团的主要领导干部，在讨论怎样领导全厂的爱国公约运动时提出：我们为了领导运动，必须亲自参加到运动中去。这是因为：第一，我们领导干部虽全有改进领导工作的愿望，但各人的看法与要求，还有相当的距离，需要订立公约，统一认识，提出明确的奋斗目标；第二，为了很好地领导爱国公约运动，领导干部应该以身作则。于是我们几个主要领导人订立了一份爱国公约。八月初修订了一次。
    在订立与执行爱国公约中，我深深地感觉到爱国公约对改进领导工作的作用。三、四年来，我巡视车间的方法，总是走马观花地花一两个钟头到全厂看一遍，一般是不深入的。七月里，我执行了爱国公约，下决心到一个车间或一个小组，每周用一个整天的时间来了解一个车间的一种工作或一个小组的工作情况。开始了解的是梳棉车间的保全小平车工作，在其中发现的问题，是全厂一般车间普遍地存在的。对于解决这一生产中的重要问题，提供了具体的经验与办法。其次，三、四年来，我没有使计划科、会计科、检查科、工程师室四个主要的掌握产量、质量、成本的部门，成为我的灵活的、有力的助手。七月里，我建立了一个制度，每星期三下午让这四个部门向我汇报工作。会上，或是研究与解决一两个有关产量、质量、成本的问题，或是由我布置工作。这样，我把四个部门统一地掌握了起来，改进了我的领导工作。
    八月份，在执行爱国公约中，我根据当月中心工作，拟具了一个月的会议计划表，克服了过去不能预先周密考虑会议内容的缺点。以前我也重视宣传鼓动工作，工会的周报“金纺工人”与黑板报办不好，我曾提出建议与批评，但未积极地给予帮助，好像这样就够了。八月开始，我提出每周为“金纺工人”写稿一篇，还计划为旅大人民日报写稿一篇，捐献稿费。这样，爱国公约就使我在重视宣传鼓动工作方面也进了一步。
    经过这一段时期的实践，我对爱国公约的认识更明确了。开始订约时，我们几个领导人还是抱着“试订”的思想，有的人还感到“订不订还不一样做工作”、“我们领导干部还要订吗？”但到八月份修订之前，我们已一致认识到爱国公约的作用。目前，已感到订爱国公约非常必要，很能帮助自己克服缺点。因为爱国公约是严肃的，以所能约束与督促自己。例如第一次所订公约中，我规定要写一篇总结保全小平车的经验的文章，虽然我很忙，但觉得订在爱国公约上的事，不实行就不对，于是抽出时间把它写成了。我们在第一次订立爱国公约之后，曾进行一次检查。这是必需的，它起了互相督促的作用。
    事实证明，领导干部的爱国公约，不但是改进领导工作的有力武器，而且它直接影响群众的爱国公约运动。因此领导干部不但要订立爱国公约，而且要订立得好，执行得好，检查得严，以作群众的榜样。
