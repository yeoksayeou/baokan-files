Jinan Industrial Bureau's Four Factories Carry Out Supplementary Democratic Reform
Boldly Mobilize the Masses to Remove Obstacles Hindering Production
Implement Ideological Education to Further Enhance Workers' Consciousness
The Jinan Industrial Bureau's Four Factories, after suppressing counter-revolutionaries in June, accepted the urgent demands of the worker masses and launched a democratic reform movement, which is now continuing.

The Jinan Industrial Bureau's Four Factories were originally the Shandong Machinery Factory of the puppet Shandong Provincial Government (actually engaged in military production). After being taken over, although many unreasonable management systems were reformed, the old personnel problems were not thoroughly addressed. Certain elements who were used by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past to rule and oppress workers continued to ride roughshod over the masses. For example, Liu Wenguang (former head of the Engineering Section) was a Kuomintang member who consistently cruelly oppressed and exploited workers, such as forcing workers to work overtime without limit, deducting workers' wages, forcing workers to perform services and give gifts, and arbitrarily dismissing and physically punishing workers. The workers couldn't bear it any longer and held a strike, once driving him out of the factory. After liberation, he continued to feign compliance while taking advantage of his position to bully workers, sow discord, and carry out sabotage. Another example is Chen Shifu (former technician, Kuomintang member, nicknamed "Second Factory Director"), who after liberation continued to adhere to a reactionary stance, proposing "A loyal subject does not serve two masters," inciting workers to flee south, and often spreading rumors to threaten the masses. The workers were extremely dissatisfied with them.

Masses Hate Remnant Feudal Reactionary Elements
Launch Accusation Movement to Struggle Against Them
Since Jinan City vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries and the factory arrested five counter-revolutionary elements in April and May, the workers' morale was greatly boosted, and they automatically reported Liu Wenguang, Chen Shifu and other bad elements. On June 19, the factory held a mass meeting to accuse counter-revolutionary elements, and the masses' emotions became even more激愤 (jīfèn, indignant), vying to accuse these bad elements, especially demanding to continue to accuse Liu Wenguang of his crimes. Some said, "We must keep an eye on Liu Wenguang, if he runs away, we won't be able to continue to accuse him!" Most people said, "We won't rest on Sunday, we'll accuse him." Judging from the situation at the time, after suppressing the counter-revolutionaries, dealing with these bad elements who ruled and oppressed the workers had become the urgent demand of the masses. The leadership then, based on the demands of the masses and the severity of the bad elements' crimes, adopted a policy of treating them differently. First, a mass meeting was convened, allowing the masses to fully expose Liu Wenguang's evil deeds and pour out their grievances. At the meeting, 130 people wrote notes to offer opinions. More than 20 people spoke on the spot, and the masses' emotions were indignant and激昂 (jī'áng, impassioned). On the spot, the administration accepted the demands of the masses and announced that Liu Wenguang would be immediately dismissed from his post pending further handling. This announcement was warmly supported by the masses, who stood up, applauded and cheered. For other elements with lighter crimes, measures such as asking them to bow their heads to the masses and confess their crimes were adopted and dealt with separately.

The specific steps are: first, convene a mass meeting, where the main elements being reported make a confession and the masses offer their opinions; second, small group discussions and propose handling methods; third, the administrative side announces the handling methods and expresses its attitude. After this stage of work is completed, the next stage is carried out from two aspects: on the staff side, due to the confession and reporting of the previous stage, some staff members with problems (but no major crimes) felt a certain pressure, felt that they could no longer hide anything, and after hearing the accusations of the masses, they also received some enlightenment and education, and had a further understanding of the Party's policies, and some voluntarily requested to confess. At the same time, when the masses accused counter-revolutionary elements, it also involved some staff members' old views and old work styles. Therefore, it was decided to further carry out a confession movement among the staff and universally examine their ideology and work style. The slogan put forward was: Clarify history, put down burdens, change work styles, and return to the ranks of the working class; strengthen staff unity and do a good job in production work. The method adopted was to learn, first give an enlightening report, and then divide into groups for discussion. On the worker side, after the masses reported and accused counter-revolutionary elements and dealt with bad elements, they had a further understanding of the old society and the old enterprise, but in their understanding they still lacked a class viewpoint. For example, they hated the foremen more than the hidden counter-revolutionary elements, hated the lackeys and henchmen more than the main elements manipulating behind the scenes, and even hated some politically or ideologically backward people equally; the methods of handling also tended to focus on simple personal revenge. At the same time, it was also found that there were vague views such as fate and superstition in the workers' thinking. Therefore, on the worker side, it was decided to carry out education on digging up the roots of suffering, and further carry out ideological mobilization. The method was also to learn, attend large classes and small group discussions. In the discussion, it was found that most workers were indeed vague about where the roots of suffering were, blaming fate, blaming their parents for not leaving them property, blaming themselves for not having the ability, etc. After studying, their thinking changed and improved.

At present, the "democratic reform make-up lesson" in the Four Factories has not yet ended, and is now entering the stage of review and summary of labor insurance registration. It is planned to further clarify the situation of the staff through this work, conduct comparison and future education, improve the ideological awareness of the staff, strengthen staff unity, and establish and consolidate new labor attitudes; then turn to improving democratic management, rectifying the organization, and establishing and improving the organization.

Improved Mass Awareness Purified the Ranks
Machine Efficiency is Much Higher Than Before
The main gains in the previous stage of the movement are:

1.  The worker masses were politically mobilized, and the old personnel problems were reformed. One of the four main elements was accused at the conference, and three made confessions at the conference, of which two have been dismissed and are temporarily undergoing labor reform. Now the workers generally reflect: "This is the real翻身 (fānshēn, to stand up/emancipate oneself)." Some workers said: "It's so happy from the heart, even if I don't eat for two days, I don't feel tired when I work!"
2.  Through confession and the previous labor insurance registration, the staff situation was largely clarified, and the worker ranks were purified.
3.  Through the education of digging up the roots of suffering, the ideological situation of the workers was initially understood, and the workers' awareness was improved. According to the investigation of the situation of 25 workers in the furnace team of the assembly department (which can represent the general situation), before the launch of this movement, for the reason of suffering, 12 people thought it was "because they had no ability," 10 people thought it was "bad fate," and 3 people thought it was "because their parents didn't leave anything." For the idea of the future, 12 people wanted to buy land to plant or rent out, 10 people wanted to open small factories, 1 person wanted to be a foreman, 1 person wanted to be a teacher, and 1 person wanted to change from a furnace worker to a lathe worker. On the view of socialism: 2 people thought that socialism has exploitation and oppression, 9 people knew nothing about it, 11 people knew a little, and 3 people knew more. After the education of digging up the roots of suffering, they all knew that the past suffering was caused by the three major enemies of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism. The workers said: "In the village, there are landlords, in the city, there is bureaucratic capital, above them, there is the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek, and there is also the American backstage, there is no good thing for the workers anywhere." Some workers said: "In the past, when we were not liberated, everyone suffered, and we all blamed it on bad fate. Why are everyone better now after liberation? What fate, everything is created by people." Some workers also said: "In the past, I thought of all kinds of ways, but I still suffered, just because I couldn't jump out of other people's (referring to imperialism, feudal forces, bureaucratic capitalists) circle."
4.  After reporting and accusing counter-revolutionary elements, after dealing with individual bad elements, after some staff members with problems confessed and检讨 (jiǎntǎo, self-criticize), and after the education of digging up the roots of suffering, the workers' production enthusiasm was improved. In the discussion of the administrative third quarter plan, they automatically set out the group's guarantee plan, and automatically revised the patriotic convention. Machine efficiency has been further improved, and the lathe speed of the machine department has generally accelerated. For example, Liu Xuesi used an automatic lathe to increase from 200 revolutions in the past to 500 revolutions; Yu Jinzhao used a belt lathe, which used to be 170 revolutions, and has now increased to 305 revolutions, which has reached the maximum efficiency of the lathe. The work enthusiasm of the staff has also been improved. In the past, work was always done separately, and now it can be done to help each other.

Grasp the Demands of the Masses and Boldly Mobilize the Masses
Draw a Clear Line Between the Enemy and Us and Unite All Employees
The factory has gained the following experiences in this stage of the democratic reform movement:

(1) The "democratic reform make-up lesson" should be thoroughly carried out, and the central link is to boldly mobilize the masses. It was right for our factory to take over with the "three originals unchanged" at the beginning, but most of them did not seriously carry out the reform or the reform was not thorough enough. As a result, the unreasonable old system in the past has not been greatly changed, and the bad elements who ruled and oppressed the workers in the past still feigned compliance and continued to bully the workers. The workers had opinions but did not dare to raise them, fearing that they would find reasons to retaliate and give them "small shoes" to wear. The workers were still oppressed and felt that they had not truly turned over. If we do not boldly mobilize the masses and let the masses stand up and change the bad elements that should be changed, it will inevitably become a serious obstacle to the further play of the masses' enthusiasm and make the people's enterprise lack a solid mass base; therefore, we must boldly mobilize the masses and thoroughly reform these obstacles. But letting go is not equal to letting go, the leadership must have control, must have a number in mind, and explain the policy to the cadres and the masses in advance, so as not to be passive and cause confusion.

(2) To mobilize the masses to carry out democratic reform, we must proceed from the actual situation of the factory, and we must be good at grasping the urgent demands of the masses. Judging from the situation of the Four Factories, after suppressing the counter-revolutionaries, the urgent demand of the masses at that time was to continue to accuse the bad elements belonging to the Kuomintang pawns and feudal foremen. This demand is essentially the demand for democratic reform. And this reform of personnel issues has become the most prominent part of the democratic reform, and the masses demanded that this issue be resolved first, and see whether the leadership supports their demand. At that time, the leading cadres of the Four Factories expressed their support, and the masses were mobilized. The development of a series of works in the factory is directly related to this mobilization.

(3) The key to correctly grasping the policy lies in educating the masses to draw a clear line. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to facilitate the rule and exploitation of the workers, used various methods to differentiate and poison the working class politically, economically, and ideologically, so that there was indeed a part of the working class that was impure; but the nature was different: some belonged to political issues, and some belonged to ideological, cognitive, and work style issues. But the masses had not received this kind of education in the past, and it was easy to draw a vague line on these boundaries. If the boundary was not clear, the implementation of the policy would inevitably lead to deviations and cause confusion. Therefore, the key lies in educating the masses to draw a clear line, distinguish between the enemy and us, so as to achieve the goal of unity of all employees.

(4) The process of mass movement is the process of ideological education. The "democratic reform make-up lesson" should implement the ideological transformation of employees. Therefore, ideological mobilization must be implemented in every movement, and clear slogans must be put forward in a timely manner according to the ideological situation of the masses; summary education should be carried out immediately after the end of the movement. From accusation to tracing the roots, from perceptual to rational, gradually raise the masses' simple understanding and experience to the level of class consciousness. In the past, our education for workers was ad hoc, with many temporary task education, lacking systematic class education and ideological education, so that even now the workers' class consciousness and ideological level are still very poor, and there are still many non-proletarian ideas.

(5) In the "democratic reform make-up lesson", we must attach importance to the transformation work of the staff. Judging from the situation of the Four Factories, there are many problems with the political situation and ideological work style of the staff; in addition, the serious education and transformation of the staff in the past was not enough, so that the staff has not made much progress for a long time, and their work enthusiasm has not been fully exerted, and there is still a gap between them and the workers. Therefore, if the old staff is not transformed, it is impossible to achieve the goal of unity and production. According to the experience of the Four Factories, the transformation work of the staff should take advantage of the mass mobilization of workers, seize the opportunity, strike while the iron is hot, and carry out criticism and self-criticism with the help of the broad masses of workers, and carry out confession and self-examination. The biggest concern of the staff about confession is: how will they be handled after the confession and whether there is a future after the confession. In response to this situation, carrying out policy education, breaking their concerns, and pointing out their future has been very effective.

    济南工业局四厂补行民主改革
    放手发动群众清除妨碍生产的障碍物
    贯彻思想教育进一步提高职工的觉悟
    济南工业局四厂于六月间在镇压反革命后，接受工人群众的迫切要求，展开民主改革运动，现在这个运动正在继续进行。
    济南工业局四厂原系伪山东省政府山东机器厂（实际上是军工生产）。接管后，虽改革了许多不合理的管理制度，但旧的人事问题则未澈底改革。某些过去国民党反动派用以统治压迫工人的分子，仍骑在群众头上压制工人。如刘文光（原工务科长），系国民党党员，一贯残酷压迫剥削工人。如无限制地强制工人加班加点，克扣工人工资，强制工人服役送礼，随便开除、体罚工人。工人忍无可忍，曾举行过罢工，一度将他驱逐出厂。解放后，他仍阳奉阴违，利用职位欺压工人，挑拨离间，进行破坏。又如陈世甫（原技术员，国民党员，外号“二厂长”），解放后仍坚持反动立场，提出“一臣不保二主”，煽动工人南逃，并常造谣威胁群众。工人对他们极端不满。
    群众痛恨残余封建反动分子
        开展控诉运动向他们作斗争
    自济南市大张旗鼓镇压反革命及该厂四、五月间两次逮捕了五个反革命分子后，工人情绪大为振奋，他们自动检举了刘文光、陈世甫等坏分子。六月十九日该厂召开群众大会，控诉了反革命分子后，群众情绪更加激愤，争先控诉这些坏分子，特别是要求继续控诉刘文光的罪行。有的说：“要把刘文光看起来，如果跑了，就不能继续控诉他啦！”多数人说：“星期不休息，控诉他。”看当时情况，镇压反革命之后，接着处理这些统治压迫工人的坏分子，已成为群众的迫切要求。领导上便根据群众要求及坏分子的罪恶轻重，采取分别对待的方针。首先，召开了群众大会，放手让群众尽情地揭发刘文光的罪恶事实，吐了苦水。大会上有一百三十人写条子提意见。有二十几人当场发言，群众情绪愤慨激昂。当场行政上接受群众要求，宣布将刘文光立即撤职，听候处理。这一宣布得到群众的热烈拥护，大家起立鼓掌欢呼。对其他罪恶较轻的分子，则采取要他们向群众低头、坦白认罪等办法，分别处理。
    具体步骤是：第一步召开群众大会，由被检举的主要分子进行坦白，由群众对他们提意见；第二步小组讨论及提出处理办法；第三步由行政方面宣布处理办法，表示态度。这一段工作结束后，下一段是从两方面进行的：在职员方面，由于前一段的坦白、检举，部分有问题的职员（但无大罪恶）感到一定的压力，觉得再隐瞒不住，他们听到群众的控诉后，也得到了一定的启发和教育，对党的政策有了进一步的认识，有的自动要求坦白。同时在群众控诉反革命分子时，也牵连到些职员的旧观点、旧作风问题。因此，决定在职员中进一步开展坦白运动并普遍地检查思想作风。提出的口号是：谈清历史，放下包袱，转变作风，回到工人阶级队伍中来；加强职工团结，搞好生产工作。方式是采取学习的办法，首先作启发报告，然后分小组讨论。在工人方面，经过群众的检举控诉反革命分子及处理坏分子，对旧社会、旧企业有了进一步的认识，但在认识上还缺乏阶级观点。譬如：对把头的仇恨甚于隐蔽的反革命分子，对狗腿子爪牙的仇恨甚于背后操纵的主要分子，甚至对一些政治或思想落后的人也同样加以仇恨；对处理的办法上也多偏重于单纯个人报复。同时也发现在工人思想中存在着命运、迷信等模糊观点。因此在工人方面，决定进行挖苦根的教育，进一步进行思想发动。方法也是学习，上大课和小组讨论。讨论中发现大多数工人对苦根到底在那儿确是模糊的，怨命、怨老人没给自己留下财产、怨个人没本事等等。学习后，思想有了转变和提高。
    目前四厂“民主改革补课”尚未结束，现正进入复查和总结劳动保险登记。打算通过这一工作进一步弄清职工情况，进行对比与前途教育，提高职工思想觉悟，加强职工团结，树立与巩固新的劳动态度；然后转入改善民主管理，整顿组织、建立与健全组织。
    提高了群众觉悟纯洁了队伍
            机器效能比以前提高了许多
    运动前一阶段的主要收获是：
    一、从政治上发动了工人群众，并从而进行了旧的人事问题的改革。四个主要分子一个被在大会控诉，三个进行了大会坦白，其中两个已撤职暂行劳动改造。现在工人普遍反映：“这次才是真翻了身。”有的工人说：“从心里痛快了，就是两天不吃饭，干活也不觉得累！”
    二、通过坦白以及加上以前的劳动保险登记，大体上弄清了职工情况，纯洁了工人队伍。
    三、通过挖苦根教育，初步了解了工人思想情况，提高了工人觉悟程度。根据装配部炉工组二十五个工人情况的调查（可代表一般），在这次运动开展以前，对于受苦的原因，认为“没本事”的十二人，“命不好”的十人，“老人没有留下”的三人。对前途的想法，想买地种或出租的十二人，想开小工厂的十人，想当工头的一人，想当老师的一人，想由炉工改为车工的一人。对社会主义的看法：认为社会主义有剥削有压迫的二人，一点不知道的九人，多少知道一点的十一人，较懂的三人。经过挖苦根教育，都知道了过去的苦是帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本主义三大敌人所造成的。工人说：“在村里有地主，城市里有官僚资本，往上有国民党蒋介石，还有美国后台，到处就没有工人的好事。”有的工人说：“过去没解放时大家受苦，都怨命不好，解放了为什么大家都好了呢？什么命，一切都是人造的。”还有的工人说：“过去想了种种办法，还是受苦，就是因为跳不出人家（指帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本家）的圈子。”
    四、经过检举控诉反革命分子，经过处理个别坏分子，经过某些有问题的职员坦白检讨及挖苦根教育，工人的生产情绪提高了。在讨论行政第三季度计划时，自动订出了小组的保证计划，自动修订了爱国公约。机器效能较前进一步提高，机工部车床转数一般加快。如刘学思用自动车床从过去二百转提高到五百转；于金照用皮带车床，过去是一百七十转，现已提高到三百零五转，已达该车床的最高效能。职员的工作情绪也提高了，过去工作从来都是各干各的，现在已能做到互相帮助。
    抓住群众要求放手发动群众
        划清敌我界线团结全体职工
    该厂在这一阶段的民主改革运动中取得了以下一些经验：
    （一）“民主改革补课”要进行澈底，中心一环是放手发动群众。我们的工厂开始“三原不动”接管下来是对的，但多未认真地进行改革或改革得不澈底。因之，过去不合理的旧制度没有大的改变，过去统治压迫工人的坏分子仍阳奉阴违，继续欺压工人，工人有意见也不敢提，怕他们找理由报复，给“小鞋”穿。工人仍受着压抑，觉得没有真正翻身。如果我们不放手发动群众，让群众起来把这些坏分子该改掉的改掉，势必成为群众积极性进一步发挥的严重障碍，而使人民企业缺乏巩固的群众基础；因此我们必须放手发动群众，对这些障碍物进行澈底的改革。但放手不等于自流，领导上要有掌握，要心中有数，把政策事先向干部和群众交代清楚，以免被动和发生混乱。
            （二）发动群众进行民主改革，必须从本厂的实际情况出发，必须善于抓住群众的迫切要求。就四厂情况来看，镇压反革命之后，群众当时的迫切要求是接着控诉属于国民党爪牙、封建把头之类的坏分子。这种要求实质上就是民主改革的要求。而这种人事问题的改革又成为民主改革中最突出的部分，群众要求首先解决这个问题，并看领导上是否支持他们这一要求。当时四厂领导干部对他们表示了支持，群众就发动起来了。厂内一系列工作的发展，都与这一发动有直接的关系。
        （三）正确掌握政策的关键，就在于教育群众划清界线。过去国民党反动派为了便于统治压榨工人，曾从政治上、经济上、思想上用种种的办法进行分化，毒害工人阶级，以致工人阶级内部确实有部分不纯；但性质是有区别的：有属于政治问题的，也有属于思想、认识、作风问题的。但群众过去没受过这方面的教育，对这些界线容易划不清，界线划不清执行政策就必然出偏差，造成混乱。因此，关键就在于教育群众划清界线，分清敌我，这样才能达到全体职工团结的目的。
    （四）群众运动过程就是思想教育过程，“民主改革补课”应贯彻对职工的思想改造。因此，在每个运动中必须贯彻思想发动，根据群众思想情况及时提出明确的口号；运动结束即进行总结教育。要由控诉到追根，由感性到理性，逐步把群众朴素的领会和经验提高到阶级觉悟的水平。过去我们对工人教育是现用现抓，临时性的任务教育多，缺乏系统的阶级教育、思想教育，因而直到现在工人的阶级觉悟思想水平还很差，存在着不少的非无产阶级的思想。
        （五）“民主改革补课”中，必须重视职员的改造工作。就四厂情况看来，职员的政治情况、思想作风，都有许多问题；再加过去对职员认真教育改造不够，以致职员较长时间进步不大，至今工作积极性尚未充分发挥，与工人之间仍存在一条鸿沟。因此，如不对旧职员进行改造，就不可能达到团结生产的目的。根据四厂经验，对职员的改造工作应乘工人群众发动之际，抓紧时机，趁热打铁，在广大工人帮助下开展批评与自我批评，开展坦白检讨。职员对坦白的最大顾虑是：坦白后对他们如何处理和坦白后有没有前途。针对这种情况，进行政策教育，打破其顾虑，并指出其前途，收效很大。
