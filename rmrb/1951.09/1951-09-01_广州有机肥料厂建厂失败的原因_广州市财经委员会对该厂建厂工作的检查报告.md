    Reasons for the Failure of the Guangzhou Organic Fertilizer Plant Construction
    ——Inspection Report on the Plant's Construction Work by the Guangzhou Municipal Finance Committee
    The Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee systematically inspected the reasons for the failure of the city's organic fertilizer plant construction from May 20th to June 30th.

    The plant's blind construction without a proper engineering plan, coupled with chaotic financial management, resulted in a severe waste and loss of state assets. The entire construction work amounted to a large experiment costing 17 billion yuan.
        No Complete and Correct Design
    The design work of the plant should have followed the sequence of chemistry – mechanics – civil engineering. These three aspects needed close coordination. However, in the design work of the plant, civil engineering started before the chemical experiments were fully completed. The mechanical part was designed and manufactured piece by piece, and changed whenever it didn't work, with countless revisions. Coordination was only discussed verbally, without concrete basis, and even these verbal discussions were not documented. Not only was the pace disordered and the coordination loose, but the design itself also made mistakes. According to the plant's report and the understanding of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee inspection team, there are several points that prove the design of the plant was incomplete and incorrect: First, there was no investigation and research on the basic raw materials, so the design of the machinery was not applicable, resulting in various losses due to rework and inability to start production. According to the plant's test report, the understanding of the plant's raw materials (Guangzhou's night soil and garbage) was only based on "predictions" and "ideals," without thorough investigation and research. Second, there were technical errors in the design. The rotary dryer for manufacturing fertilizer was supposed to dry 70 tons per day. Initially, because they didn't know the holding capacity of the rotary kiln should account for what percentage of the kiln's volume, they confidently designed it to be one-third of the volume. As a result, after all the mechanical equipment was installed, they checked a "Mechanical Engineering Handbook" and found that the holding capacity was 12%, a difference of more than two times, nearly three times. Third, the constant revisions of the design showed the incompleteness and inaccuracy of the original design. Every machine in the plant was modified, and all civil engineering works, except for dormitories, offices, and warehouses not directly related to production, were also modified. The cost of the modifications, for the machine part, accounted for 6.91% of the total plan, totaling 320 million yuan (excluding the materials used); the civil engineering part accounted for 26.4% of the original plan, totaling 1.92 billion yuan. In terms of the number of modifications, the single screw conveyor has been repaired more than 30 times, and is still not completely repaired. All other machines need major or minor modifications, and it is still difficult to be sure whether they can be used after the modifications.
        Waste Caused by Incorrect Design
    The losses caused by the incorrect design of the organic fertilizer plant are incalculable. Just calculating a few of the more serious cases, the losses are already staggering: Due to design errors, the output was reduced by six-sevenths, only one-seventh of the original planned 70 tons. Except for the kiln, all equipment is for producing 70 tons, but now it can only produce 10 tons, so six-sevenths of the equipment cannot play its role. If the rotary dryer is renovated or rebuilt to achieve an output of 70 tons, according to Deputy Director Kang Wenbin's estimate, all mechanical equipment will also need to be appropriately strengthened or redesigned, and the civil construction adapted to the machinery will require an additional investment of more than 10 billion yuan. Another loss is the delay in starting production and the cost of starting the business. The original plan was to start production in February of this year, but it has been delayed for six months until the end of July. August 1st was only the start of trial production, and it is still uncertain when it can officially start production.

    The current monthly expenditure is more than 80 million yuan, and 480 million yuan has been paid in six months; according to the plant's revenue and expenditure budget, the monthly profit after starting production would be more than 330 million yuan, so 2 billion yuan has been lost in six months, for a total loss of nearly 2.5 billion yuan. The quality of the product is only 70% of the original plan. The main chemical components of organic fertilizer are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In the fertilizer used in China, the amount of nitrogen is the determining factor in the value of the fertilizer, and the amount of nitrogen is directly proportional to the price. The original design of the mixed fertilizer at the plant was 3% nitrogen; now, due to the high amount of minerals in Chinese garbage, accounting for 70% of the garbage, it can only achieve 2% nitrogen content. In other words, the same cost can only produce 70% of the value of the original plan. A large amount of minerals rolled around in the manufacturing process, abrading the machines, increasing costs, and reducing quality. This loss was caused by the failure to investigate and test the composition of the garbage in advance. Therefore, even if the plant can produce 70 tons of fertilizer, the selling price will still have to be discounted by 30%. A rough estimate is that it will reduce the planned amount by 560 million yuan per month. Based on the current situation analysis, the investment in the plant is not only unprofitable, but also forms a long-term burden on Guangzhou's finances. Due to design errors, reduced output, and discounted quality, the original design could have a surplus of 5 billion yuan per year; if calculated based on a daily production of 10 tons, there would be a monthly loss of 140 million yuan, and an annual loss of more than 1.6 billion yuan.
        Financial Chaos Leads to Exhaustion of Funds
    The total budget of the organic fertilizer plant was more than 17.6 billion yuan, and the Central and Southern Finance Department approved 17 billion yuan, which was allocated to the plant in batches from August to December 1950. As of May 20th of this year, more than 16.5 billion yuan had been spent; in addition, there were more than 1.9 billion yuan in outstanding payments, for a total expenditure of more than 18.4 billion yuan. The expenditure figure has exceeded the budget approved by the Central and Southern Finance Department by more than 1.4 billion yuan. According to the budget of 17 billion yuan investment, there will be no possibility of continuing operations. The plant originally budgeted 12.6 billion yuan for fixed investment, but the actual expenditure was more than 16.3 billion yuan, exceeding the original budget by more than 3.7 billion yuan; the principle of using special funds for special purposes was not adhered to, and the plant used its own discretion to use the 5 billion yuan in working capital, resulting in the occupancy of more than 74% of the working capital necessary for the plant's continued operation, completely exhausting the plant's funds. Blind construction and abuse of funds are the main reasons for exceeding the budget. According to the inspection team's understanding, many cost overruns were unnecessary. For example, the original budget for the construction of the office building was 492 million yuan, but the actual expenditure was 786 million yuan, exceeding the budget by 294 million yuan; in fact, the construction of the office building did not need to be so magnificent. From the perspective of actual expenditures, the part used for machinery directly related to production only exceeded the number by 382 million yuan, which shows that the original allocation of funds was not insufficient for production needs.

    The financial management chaos of the plant is manifested in the very serious situation of dispersed and disorganized finances. No one knows exactly how much money and materials there are; everyone has the right to purchase, and no one cares. After the inspection team arrived at the plant and inventoried the warehouse, they found that the plant's inventory list of materials was completely inconsistent with the book balance. According to the accounting records, there were only three items: cement, bags, and tires. However, there were other machine parts such as steel plates and motor water pipes in the warehouse. Moreover, except for the number of bags that matched the book balance, the other two items did not match.

    The plant's violations of financial and economic systems are also serious: (1) Failure to comply with the cash management system. The plant's cash on hand was stipulated not to exceed 1 million yuan. Deputy Director of the Health Bureau Kang Wenbin repeatedly inspected the plant, and the plant's financial staff claimed that they were fully complying with the cash management regulations. The inspection team stationed at the plant to check the accounts and found that in addition to the cash stored by the plant's cashier department, they also cleverly set up a "trial machine reserve fund" account to hide 30 million yuan; and under the "temporary payment" account, they set up more than a dozen reserve funds; the petty cash account totaled more than 120 million yuan, which was distributed to various departments for use, seeking convenience and evading cash management. (2) Operating materials not needed by the plant. On December 14, 1950, the plant purchased 461 tons of Japanese cement, a total of 10,142 bags, with a total cost of more than 697 million yuan. There are currently 5,581 bags remaining. This is not needed by the plant, and the loss due to the price drop is as high as more than 190 million yuan.
        Where is the Root of the Mistake?
    The design errors and poor financial management of the organic fertilizer plant are the plant's main problems. According to the opinions of the inspection team after the inspection, the root cause of these errors is the Health Bureau's lax leadership; another reason is that the leading cadres of the Health Bureau and the organic fertilizer plant have a strong supply system mentality.

    The plant is led by the Health Bureau, which formed a preparatory committee for the organic fertilizer plant. It consists of five people: Director of the Health Bureau Li Dachao, Deputy Director Kang Wenbin, and engineering technology experts Jian Haoran, Wu Yukun, and Chen Hongjie. This organization is the highest leadership organization in the plant, and also the link between the Health Bureau and the technical and management personnel in the plant. However, this committee did not establish a regular meeting system, nor did it play a leading role. In fact, all work was decided by a small group meeting of Jian Haoran, Wu Yukun, and Chen Hongjie. Because the Health Bureau did not have practical leadership, a state of anarchy of going their own way occurred. Under the preparatory committee, there were four groups: chemical, civil engineering, mechanical, and management, which were respectively responsible by Jian, Chen, Wu, and Kang. Because the preparatory committee did not have a regular meeting system and specific instructions, the four groups were independent, unrelated, and each did its own thing. If they couldn't figure it out, Jian, Wu, and Chen would meet to decide; there was no overall leadership, forming a leaderless situation.

    The specific phenomenon of the supply system mentality is that the regular expenses have no standards, only focusing on construction and not asking about the effect, only seeking actual reimbursement of expenses. For example, all budget requests were stamped by Deputy Director Kang Wenbin. In fact, Kang Wenbin had already discovered that there was waste in the management fee expenditure, but he did not send anyone to correct it in time. As long as it can start production, the purchase of things needed in the plant has not been tightened; and the cost after starting production and exceeding the budget have not been investigated deeply. Under the control of this thought, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in the management expenses of the plant is considerable. From August last year to May this year, the management fees totaled more than 540 million yuan, and preliminary review revealed that more than 47 million yuan was wasted.

    Finally, the inspection team believes that the way to save the plant is to strengthen leadership, unify management, think deeply, make a detailed plan, correct mistakes, redesign, thoroughly transform, and then formally start production. Do not rush to start production, so as not to waste more of the people's blood and sweat.

    广州有机肥料厂建厂失败的原因
    ——广州市财经委员会对该厂建厂工作的检查报告
    广州市人民政府财政经济委员会，由五月二十日到六月三十日有系统地检查了该市有机肥料厂建厂失败的原因。
    该厂由于没有正确的工程计划而盲目施工，以及财务管理的混乱，招致国家资财的严重浪费与损失。整个建厂工作等于作了一次花费一百七十亿元的大试验。
        没有完整的正确的设计
    该厂设计工作的步骤应当是化学——机械——土木。三者需要密切的配合。而该厂的设计工作上，化学部分的试验尚未全部完成，土木即行施工。机械部分逐部机器设计，逐部制造，行不通了就改，改了不知多少次。配合工作只是口头谈谈，没有具体的根据，连口头谈谈的文字纪录都没有。不仅是步调上紊乱，配合上松懈，而且设计上也犯了错误。根据该厂的报告和该市人民政府财政经济委员会检查小组的了解，有几点可以证明该厂的设计是不完整、不正确的：首先是对基本原料没有调查研究，因此机械的设计不能适用，遭受了翻修和不能开工的种种损失。根据该厂的试机报告，对该厂的原料
    （广州的大粪和垃圾）的认识，只是些“预测”和“理想”，并没有经过调查研究。其次是设计上的技术错误。制造肥料的旋转烘干炉，每日烘干量应当是七十吨。当初因不知运转烘炉的持有量应当占炉的体积的多少，设计时就肯定为体积的三分之一。结果机械统通安装好了，一翻“机械工程手册”，发现持有量是百分之十二，相差两倍多，几近三倍。其三，从设计不断地修正，可以看出原设计的不完整和不精确。该厂每一部机器都经过修改，土木工程除与生产无直接关连的宿舍、办公厅、仓库外，也全经过修改。修改的费用，机器部分占了全计划百分之六点九一，共计金额三亿二千余万元（所用的材料还未计算在内）；土木工程占原计划百分之二十六点四，共计金额十九亿二千余万元。从修改的次数来说，单螺旋输送器已经修理了三十多次，到现在还未完全修理好。其他全部机器都需大小的修改，而且修改后是否有把握能用还难以肯定。
        设计不正确造成的浪费
    有机肥料厂由于设计不正确而招致的损失，这笔账是无从计算的。单就几桩较严重的计算一下，这个损失就已非常惊人：由于设计的错误，产量减少七分之六，仅为原计划七十吨的七分之一。除了烘炉外，所有设备都是生产七十吨的，现在只能生产十吨，因此有七分之六的设备是不能发挥作用的。倘将旋转烘干炉翻修或重行新建，使达到七十吨的产量，据康文彬副局长估计：全部机械设备也要适当强化或重新设计及适应机械上的土木建设等费用，非再增加一百亿元以上的投资不可。再就是开工延期、开办费的损失。原定计划是今年二月开工，至七月底为止，已经延期六个月，八月一日也只是开始试制，还不能肯定何时能正式开工。
    现在每月开支在八千万元以上，六个月已支付了四亿八千万元；假如照该厂收支概算来说，开工后每月盈利三亿三千余万元，六个月少赚了二十亿元，合计将近损失二十五亿元。产品的质量仅为原计划百分之七十。有机肥料主要的化学成份为氮、磷、钾，在中国使用的肥料，氮的含量多少是肥料价值决定的因素，氮的多寡和价格也成正比例。该厂原设计混合肥料的氮为百分之三；现由于中国垃圾矿物质太多，占垃圾的百分之七十，因此只能做到含氮百分之二。换句话说，花同样的成本，只能产生原计划七成的价值。大量的矿物质在制造过程中打了个滚，磨损了机器，加高了成本，降低了质量。这个损失是由于对垃圾成份事先没有调查试验而产生的。因此，该厂即使能出产七十吨肥料，售价上还要打七折，粗略的估计，每月就比计划减少了五亿六千万元。按现在情况分析，该厂投资不仅无利可图，反而形成广州市财政上的长期包袱。由于设计上错误，产量减少，质量打折扣，原设计每年可盈余五十亿元；如以每日生产十吨计算，每月亏一亿四千万元，全年亏十六亿余元。
        财务混乱造成资金枯竭
    有机肥料厂全部预算为一百七十六亿余元，中南财政部批准为一百七十亿元，于一九五○年八月至十二月分批拨付该厂。至本年五月二十日止已动支一百六十五亿余元；另外还有应付未付款项十九亿余元，合计动支一百八十四亿余元，动支数字已超出中南批准预算十四亿余元。照预算一百七十亿元投资额，则将无继续经营之可能。该厂原列预算固定投资一百二十六亿余元，实际动支数为一百六十三亿余元，超出原预算三十七亿余元；没有掌握专款专用的原则，而自行在流动资金五十亿元项下动用，致将该厂继续经营所必须的流动资金占用了百分之七十四以上，使该厂资金完全枯竭。盲目施工、滥用资金是超出预算的主要原因。据检查小组的了解，很多工程超支是不必要的。例如办公厅的建筑原预算是四亿九千二百万元，实际支出数是七亿八千六百万元，超出预算二亿九千四百万元；而实际上办公厅的建筑是不必这么堂皇的。从实际动支数来观察，用于生产直接有关系的机器部分超出数字只有三亿八千二百万元，这说明原拨资金并不是不敷生产需要的。
    该厂的财务管理的混乱，表现在财务分散凌乱的情况非常严重，没有人知道到底有多少钱，有多少物资；谁都有采购权，谁也都不管。检查小组到该厂后，进行盘点仓库，发现该厂库存物资清单与账面完全不符。根据会计材料账，只有士敏土、布袋、轮胎三项，可是仓库里又另外有钢板、马达水管等各种机器零件。而且除布袋数目与账面相符外，其他两项都不符合。
    该厂违反财经制度的现象也是严重的：（一）不遵守现金管理制度。该厂库存现金规定不得超过一百万元，卫生局副局长康文彬屡次往该厂检查，该厂负责财务工作人员均称完全遵照现金管理规定执行。检查小组驻厂查账，发觉除该厂出纳部门存贮现金外，并巧立“试机备用金”科目，匿存三千万元；又于“暂付款”科目下，设立十余个备用金；零用金的账户计一亿二千余万元分散各部门使用，贪图便利，逃避现金管理。（二）经营非该厂所需的物资。该厂于一九五○年十二月十四日，购入日本士敏土四百六十一吨，共一万零一百四十二包，成本总值六亿九千七百余万元，现尚存五千五百八十一包，这并非该厂所需，因跌价而损失了一亿九千余万元之巨。
        错误的根源在哪里？
    有机肥料厂的设计错误、财务管理不善，是该厂主要的问题。根据检查小组检查后的意见，认为这错误的根源是卫生局疏于领导；另一个原因是卫生局及有机肥料厂的领导干部，存在着浓厚的供给制思想。
    该厂由卫生局领导，组成有机肥料厂筹备委员会。由卫生局局长李达潮、副局长康文彬及工程技术专家简浩然、吴毓昆、陈鸿阶等五人组成。这机构是厂中的最高领导机构，也是卫生局和厂中负责技术及管理人员联系的纽带。但这个会没有建立经常的会议制度，也没有发挥领导的作用，一切工作实际上是由简浩然、吴毓昆、陈鸿阶三人的小组会议来商量决定的。由于卫生局没有实际的领导，就发生各自为政的无政府状态。在筹备委员会下分设化学、土木、机械、管理四组，分由简、陈、吴、康负责。由于筹备委员会没有经常的会议制度及具体指示，因此四组分立，各不相关，各搞各的。搞不通了，就由简、吴、陈三人会商决定；没有一个总的领导，形成群龙无首的局面。
    供给制思想具体现象是经常开支漫无标准，只顾建设不问效果，但求实报实销。如所有预算请款，都经副局长康文彬盖章。事实上康文彬早已发现管理费的开支方面存在着浪费，虽曾提出意见，但未派人及时纠正。只要能开工，有关厂内需要的东西的买入都未给以紧缩处理；而对开工后的成本及超出预算却未加深究。在这种思想支配下，该厂在管理费用方面铺张浪费现象是可观的。从去年八月到今年五月为止，管理费共支出五亿四千余万元，经初步审查就有四千七百余万元是浪费了的。
    最后，检查小组认为：挽救该厂的办法，是加强领导，统一管理，深思熟虑，作出周密的计划，纠正错误，重新设计，彻底改造，然后再正式开工。不应急切忙于开工，以免浪费人民更多的血汗。
