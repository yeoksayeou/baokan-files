Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 20th: The "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "Against the Conspiracies of Imperialist Aggressors," stating: The world's peace movement, struggling against the imperialists who are instigating another world war, has become an invincible and powerful force. As the sinister activities of the leaders of the North Atlantic military bloc increasingly threaten the cause of peace, the voices of peace defenders are now even more resolute.

The U.S. government, in violation of all international agreements and disregarding the desire of the people of Asia and the world for a peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue, signed the so-called "peace treaty" with Japan, which prepares for another war. Following this, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France issued a joint statement in Washington, announcing the establishment of regular German armed forces in West Germany. This new conspiracy of the war-mongers is another step forward for the aggressive imperialist countries on the road to preparing and launching war. U.S. and British imperialism have openly called for West Germany and Japan to join their military aggression blocs and have assigned the revanchists of West Germany and Japan to serve as shock troops in these blocs.

The peace-loving people, who vividly remember the horrors of the last war, are responding to these new conspiracies of the war-mongers by intensifying their efforts to defend and consolidate peace.

The Soviet Union's peace policy, dedicated to achieving a peaceful and democratic resolution of the German and Japanese issues, has received enthusiastic response and full support from billions of well-intentioned people in various countries. At the San Francisco conference, people of all countries once again witnessed how the Soviet Union steadfastly defended the cause of peace. The great Chinese people resolutely oppose the separate peace treaty with Japan. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, stated in his statement regarding the separate "peace treaty" with Japan signed by the U.S. and Britain: "The Chinese people are determined to resolutely oppose to the end the vicious conspiracy of the U.S. government to intensify preparations for a new war of aggression by utilizing the San Francisco peace treaty with Japan and the so-called U.S.-Japan bilateral security treaty." Along with the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, tens of millions of people in Korea, Vietnam, India, Burma, and other countries in Asia and the Pacific region are also engaged in the struggle against the collusion between U.S. aggressors and Japanese militarists. The Asian people's struggle for a peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue receives the support of all progressive mankind who desire lasting peace in the Far East. This is also essential for the Japanese people, with more than five million Japanese people having already signed protests against the separate treaty.

The struggle for peace and German unification is growing throughout Germany. Broad sections of the German people are increasingly aware that the Western countries are placing Germany in grave danger. The proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to convene an all-German conference to hold all-German elections and accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany expresses the will of the broad masses of the people of the German Democratic Republic and the wishes of the vast majority of people in West Germany. The German people's struggle against the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors is supported by millions of people in countries all over the world, who believe that a peaceful resolution of the German issue is a major condition for preventing another world war.

The will of millions of people demanding peace is advancing relentlessly. The fact that honest people around the world have unanimously signed the World Peace Council's historic declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact vividly demonstrates their wishes. The peace-loving people will resolutely curb the plots and intrigues of the enemies of peace, and they will unite even more closely around the bulwark of world peace—the Soviet Union—and fight more resolutely than ever to defend and consolidate world peace. The great army of peace fighters is encouraged by Comrade Stalin's words: If the peoples of all countries take up the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated.

    苏联真理报发表社论
    号召反对美英帝国主义准备战争阴谋
    坚决地为维护与巩固世界和平而斗争
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“真理报”发表题为“反对帝国主义侵略者的阴谋”的社论说：全世界与煽动另一次世界大战的帝国主义者斗争的保卫和平运动已成为无敌的强大力量了。由于北大西洋军事集团的首领们的罪恶活动日益使和平事业受到威胁，和平保卫者的呼声现在是更加坚决了。
    美国政府违背一切国际协议，不顾亚洲以及全世界各国人民要求和平解决日本问题的愿望，签订了准备另一次战争的所谓对日“和约”。接着，美英法三国外长会议在华盛顿发表了联合声明，宣布在西德建立德国正规军。战争贩子的新阴谋，是侵略成性的帝国主义国家在准备和发动战争的道路上又前进了一步。美英帝国主义已公开叫西德和日本参加它们的军事侵略集团，并派定西德和日本的复仇主义者担任这些集团里的冲锋队的任务。
    爱好和平的人民对上次战争的恐怖记忆犹新，为了答复战争贩子这些新阴谋，他们正以更大的努力展开保卫和巩固和平的斗争。
    苏联的和平政策致力于争取德国和日本问题的和平与民主的解决，这个政策受到各国亿万善良人民的热烈响应和全力支持。各国人民在旧金山会议上再次看到苏联如何坚持不渝地保卫和平事业。伟大的中国人民坚决反对对日单独和约。中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来关于美英签订对日单独“和约”的声明说：“中国人民对于美国政府利用旧金山对日和约以及所谓美日双边安全条约来加紧准备新的侵略战争的恶毒阴谋，一定要坚决反对到底。”和苏联、中华人民共和国的人民一道，朝鲜、越南、印度、缅甸及亚洲和太平洋地区其他国家的千千万万人民也正在进行斗争，反对美国侵略者与日本军国主义者勾结。亚洲人民为争取日本问题的和平解决而进行的斗争，获得全体要求远东持久和平的进步人类的支持。这对于日本人民也有切身的必要，已经有五百多万日本人民在反对单独和约的抗议书上签了名。
    争取和平和德国统一的斗争正在全德国增长。广大阶层的德国人民愈来愈清楚地认识到，西方国家使德国面临着严重的危险。德意志民主共和国人民议会关于召开全德会议以举行全德选举和加速缔结对德和约的建议，表达了德意志民主共和国广大人民群众的意志和西德绝大多数人民的愿望。德国人民反对帝国主义侵略者的阴谋的斗争，受到全世界各国千百万人民的支持，他们都认为和平解决德国问题是防止另一次大战的主要条件。
    千百万人民要求和平的意志正在不屈不挠地前进，全世界正直人民都一致在世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的历史性宣言上签名，就生动地表现了他们的愿望。爱好和平的人民将坚决地遏止和平敌人的阴谋诡计，他们更加紧密地团结在世界和平的堡垒——苏联的周围，比以前更坚决地为维护及巩固世界和平而斗争。和平战士的大军受到斯大林同志的话的鼓励：如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。
