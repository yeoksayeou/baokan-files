    (III) Welcoming the Advanced Payment of Patriotic Donations by the Industrial and Commercial Sectors
    In order to oppose American imperialism's sabotage of the Kaesong negotiations and its separate peace treaty with Japan, the industrial and commercial sectors in several cities have launched a movement to pay patriotic donations in advance. The industrial and commercial sector in Dalian took the lead in launching the advanced payment movement in late August. As of September 5th, the total amount of payments had reached 6.7555 billion yuan, completing more than one-half of the original six-month donation total (9 fighter planes, equivalent to 13.5 billion yuan). It has been decided to strive to overfulfill the entire donation plan before the end of October. The industrial and commercial sector in Beijing, standing at the forefront of the patriotic donation movement, has also decided to pay half of the six-month donation total (approximately 40 fighter planes, equivalent to 60 billion yuan) in September as a gift for the second National Day and to complete the entire donation plan before the end of November. The industrial and commercial sector in Baoding has decided to pay the monthly donation before the 20th of each month and to pay the entire donation before the end of November. The industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai and Zhengzhou held collective donation conferences on September 1st and August 31st, respectively. On September 1st alone, the industrial and commercial sector in Shanghai actually paid a total of over 89.3 billion yuan. The industrial and commercial sectors in Wuhan, Shenyang, and other cities have also launched competitions to pay patriotic donations on schedule. The industrial and commercial sector in Wuhan was the first to challenge the industrial and commercial sectors nationwide to a competition to pay donations on schedule. The advanced payment movement of the industrial and commercial sectors in the aforementioned regions is welcome, and we hope that the industrial and commercial sectors in all regions will follow their example. In addition to the industrial and commercial sector, people from all walks of life are also increasing donations of airplanes and artillery or paying patriotic donations in advance in order to oppose the provocative and aggressive acts of American imperialism in sabotaging the Kaesong negotiations and pursuing a separate peace treaty with Japan. These patriotic actions of people from all walks of life are equally welcome, and we also hope that regions and units with originally lower donation figures or the ability to pay in advance will learn from the examples of advanced regions and units, and everyone will pay on schedule and strive to complete the donation plan ahead of schedule or exceed the target.
    All facts continue to prove that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. Although it has suffered a heavy defeat on the Korean battlefield and has been forced to begin armistice negotiations with our side, it still persists in aggression against Korea, still persists in arming Japan, and still attempts to further invade China. The U.S. government's shameless sabotage of the Kaesong negotiations over the past two months, as well as the recent U.S. government's forcible convening of the illegal San Francisco Peace Conference and the passage of the illegal peace treaty with Japan, have further exposed the sinister face of American imperialism continuing to be hostile to the Chinese people. Precisely because of this, the people of our entire country must continue to resolutely struggle to smash the aggressive plans of American imperialism. And to fully strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, especially to strengthen the donation of airplanes and artillery movement, plays the most important role in completing this task. This is the reason why the advanced payment of patriotic donations by the industrial and commercial sectors in Dalian, Beijing, and other cities is welcomed by the people of the whole country.

    （三）欢迎工商界的提前交纳爱国捐款运动
    为了反对美国帝国主义破坏开城谈判及单独对日媾和，若干城市的工商界已经展开了提前交纳爱国捐款运动。大连工商界首先于八月下旬发起提前交款运动，至九月五日为止，交款总额已达到六十七亿五千五百余万元，完成了原定半年捐款总额（战斗机九架，折合人民币一百三十五亿元）的二分之一以上；并已决定争取于十月底以前超额完成全部捐献计划。站在爱国捐献运动前列的北京工商界，亦已决定在九月份内交清半年捐款总额（约战斗机四十架，折合人民币六百亿元）的半数以作为第二届国庆节的献礼，并决定于十一月底以前完成全部捐献计划。保定市工商界决定每个月二十日以前交清该月份捐款，并于十一月底以前交清全部捐款。上海市和郑州市工商界分别于九月一日及八月三十一日举行了集体交纳爱国捐款大会，上海市工商界在九月一日一天实交捐款共达八百九十三亿余元。武汉、沈阳等市工商界也展开了如期交纳爱国捐款的竞赛，武汉市工商界并最先向全国工商界提出如期交纳捐款的竞赛挑战。上述各地工商界的提前交款运动，是值得欢迎的，我们希望各地工商界都向他们看齐。除工商界以外，其他各界人民为了反对美国帝国主义破坏开城谈判及单独对日媾和的挑衅侵略行为，也纷纷增献飞机大炮，或纷纷提前交纳爱国捐款。各界人民的这种爱国行动，同样是值得欢迎的，我们也希望原来捐献数字较低或有提前交款能力的地区和单位，学习先进地区和单位的榜样，大家都来如期交款，并争取提前或超额完成捐献计划。
    现在一切事实都继续证明，美国帝国主义是我们中国人民的死敌，尽管它已在朝鲜战场上受到惨重的失败，并且被迫与我方开始举行了停战谈判，但是它仍然坚持侵略朝鲜，仍然坚持武装日本，仍然企图进一步侵略中国。两个多月来美国政府无耻地破坏开城谈判，以及最近美国政府强制召开非法的旧金山对日和会、通过非法的对日和约，都进一步暴露了美国帝国主义继续与中国人民为敌的凶恶面目。正因为如此，我们全国人民必须为粉碎美国帝国主义的侵略计划而继续坚决奋斗。而全力加强抗美援朝运动，首先是加强捐献飞机大炮运动，对于完成这个任务，有着最重大的作用。大连、北京以及其他城市的工商界的提前交纳爱国捐款运动之所以值得全国人民欢迎，其原因就在这里。
