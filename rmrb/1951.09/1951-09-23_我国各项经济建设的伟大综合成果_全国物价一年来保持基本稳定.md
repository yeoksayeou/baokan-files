Xinhua News Agency Report: In the second year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, national prices have remained basically stable. According to statistics from the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in early September, the average total index of wholesale prices of 25 major commodities in six major cities—Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an (with December 31, 1950, as the base period—100)—was 114.8, a slight increase of 14.8 percent compared to the end of last year.

Over the past year, the first characteristic of national prices has been their consistent stability throughout the four seasons. For example, grain prices during the lean season between spring and summer, prices of non-staple foods during the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, and prices of most industrial products since the autumn harvest have generally remained stable. According to statistics, the average total index of wholesale prices of the aforementioned 25 major commodities in the six major cities was 105 in March, 109.1 in May, and 111.3 in July. Over the past nine months, the national wholesale price index has only increased slightly by about 15 percent, with minimal monthly and quarterly increases, basically maintaining stability.

Another characteristic of national prices over the past year is a slight increase within basic stability, with industrial product prices slightly higher than agricultural product prices. For example, in early September, the average index of wholesale prices of cotton yarn and cloth commodities in the aforementioned six major cities increased by 23.2 percent compared to the end of last year, while grain increased by only 11.4 percent, and non-staple foods by only 9.7 percent. This reflects the continued improvement of China's economic situation. Over the past year, the increase in the purchasing power of the Chinese people has been astonishing, with the most conservative estimate being about 30 percent. The national demand for industrial products has therefore increased unprecedentedly. At the same time, because China's original industrial production was insufficient to meet the normal needs of the people, and the speed of recovery and development of industrial production in the past two years has not kept up with the speed of increase in the commodity portion of agricultural products and the growth of farmers' purchasing power, the prices of some industrial products have shown a slight increase. This is an unavoidable phenomenon in the process of recovery, development, and transformation of China's industrial and agricultural production.

The basic stability of national prices is a great comprehensive achievement of China's various economic constructions. Since the past year, due to the near balance of national fiscal revenue and expenditure, the further recovery of industrial and agricultural production, the rapid implementation of land reform in new areas, the extensive development of urban-rural exchanges, and the sale of 80 percent of local specialties from various regions, China's prices have been able to remain stable despite being in a serious struggle against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

The stability of prices reflects the stability of China's finance and currency value. The exchange rate between the RMB and the US dollar was 31,000 to 1 on October 1, 1950, and 22,270 to 1 on September 10, 1951. Over the past year, the value of the RMB against the US dollar has increased by more than 28 percent. This fact once again confirms the superiority of China's New Democratic society and political system.

### 我国各项经济建设的伟大综合成果  全国物价一年来保持基本稳定

    我国各项经济建设的伟大综合成果
    全国物价一年来保持基本稳定
   【本报讯】据新华社讯：中华人民共和国成立后的第二年中，全国物价基本稳定。根据中央人民政府贸易部统计，九月上旬，天津、上海、汉口、广州、重庆、西安六大城市二十五种主要商品批发物价的平均总指数（以一九五零年十二月三十一日为基期——一百）为一一四点八，比去年年底微升百分之十四点八。
    一年来，全国物价的第一个特点是四季始终稳定。例如，今年春夏间青黄不接时的粮价，春节和中秋节的副食品价格，秋收以来大部工业品价格，一般地都保持平稳。据统计，上述六大城市二十五种主要商品批发物价的平均总指数，三月份为一零五，五月份为一零九点一，七月份为一一一点三；过去九个月内，全国批发物价总指数只微升百分之十五左右，其间按月按季递升极少，基本上保持稳定。
    一年来全国物价的另一个特点是在基本稳定之中有微微上升，其中工业品价格又稍高于农产品。例如，九月上旬，上述六大城市花纱布类商品批发价平均指数，比去年年底上升了百分之二十三点二，而粮食类只上升百分之十一点四，副食品类只百分之九点七。这是我国经济情况继续好转的一种反映。一年来，我国人民购买力的提高十分惊人，最保守的估计是百分之三十左右。全国人民对于工业产品的需求，因而空前增大。同时，由于我国原有工业生产不够人民正常需要，两年来工业生产恢复、发展的速度又赶不上农产品中商品部分增加的速度和农民购买力的增长，因此，部分工业品价格就呈现了微微上升之象。这是我国工农业生产恢复、发展和改造过程中不可避免的现象。
    全国物价保持基本稳定，是我国各项经济建设的伟大的综合成果。一年以来，由于国家财政收支接近平衡，工农业生产的进一步恢复，新区迅速进行土地改革，城乡交流广泛开展，各地土特产品百分之八十销出，因此，虽然处在抗美援朝严重斗争的情况中，我国物价依然能够保持稳定。
    物价的稳定反映了我国金融、币值的稳定。人民币和美元的比价，在一九五零年十月一日是三万一千比一，一九五一年九月十日是二万二千二百七十比一；一年来，人民币对美元的比值已提高百分之二十八以上，这个事实，又一次证实了我国新民主主义社会、政治制度的优越性。
