Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: According to TASS news: The Soviet people are widely launching a signature campaign for the declaration of a Five-Power Peace Pact. From Moscow to the southern oil city of Baku, from Uzbekistan in Central Asia to Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, from Russian cities to Armenian villages, the signature campaign is flourishing. In the first four days of the signature campaign, 755,000 people in the Moscow region and Moscow city had already signed. Laboring people in various places held signature rallies, expressing their firm will to defend peace and intensify labor. At a mass rally at the Stalin Steel Factory in Leningrad, lathe operator Gulchenko said:
	"Our signature is a powerful expression of the Soviet people's firm determination to maintain peace. We will do our best to speed up the production of machines needed for communist construction projects as our contribution to the cause of peace." Koshevaya, the mother of the Soviet hero Oleg Koshevoy, leader of the "Young Guard" (an underground organization that resisted the German fascist bandits during the Great Patriotic War), said: "The warmongers want to murder our children. Soviet women must unite closely with women all over the world to oppose them. We must sign the declaration with one heart and one mind."
	On the great communist construction sites, there is also immense political and labor enthusiasm. The construction workers of the Volga-Don Canal shouted in unison after the signature campaign began: "We want to defend peace!" The famous dredger driver Simak, who built the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric project, has successfully excavated more than one million cubic meters of earth. He emphasized that the peaceful construction labor of all our construction workers will make the lives of the Soviet people happier. We firmly support the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.
	At the same time, the republics of Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Lithuania, and others have successively held all-republic peace conferences. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and other union republics are preparing to convene peace conferences to promote the signature campaign for the peace pact declaration.

    全力增进国家建设保卫和平
    广泛展开和平公约签名运动
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联人民广泛展开五大国缔结和平公约宣言的签名运动。从莫斯科到南方的石油城市巴库，从中亚细亚的乌兹贝克到波罗的海的立陶宛，从俄罗斯的城市到亚美尼亚的乡村，签名运动正在蓬勃展开着。莫斯科州和莫斯科市在签名运动的头四天内，已有七十五万五千人签了名。各地劳动人民纷纷举行签名大会，表示了保卫和平和加紧劳动的坚定意志。在列宁格勒斯大林钢铁工厂的群众大会上，镟工古尔琴科说：
    “我们的签名就是苏联人民维护和平的坚定决心的有力表现。我们要竭尽全力加速生产共产主义建设工程所需的机器，作为我们对和平事业的贡献。”苏联英雄、“青年近卫军”（伟大卫国战争期间反抗德国法西斯匪帮的地下组织）领袖奥列格·柯歇伐依的母亲柯歇伐雅说：“战争贩子想谋害我们的孩子，苏联妇女要和全世界妇女紧密团结起来反对他们。我们要万众一心地在宣言上签名。”
    在伟大的共产主义建设地带上，也洋溢着巨大的政治和劳动热情。伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑工人在签名运动开始之后，一致高呼：“我们要保卫和平！”修筑齐姆良水电工程的著名的挖泥机司机席马克，已胜利地挖了一百多万公方的泥土，他强调指出：我们全体建筑工人的和平建设劳动，将使苏联人民的生活更加幸福。我们坚决拥护五大国缔结和平公约。
    和这同时，乌克兰、阿塞拜疆、亚美尼亚、立陶宛等共和国已相继举行了全共和国拥护和平大会。哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、摩尔达维亚及其他加盟共和国正在筹备召开拥护和平大会，推动和平公约宣言的签名运动。
