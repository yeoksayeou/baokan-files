    The Chinese and Korean People's Forces Annihilate Invading Enemies on the Eastern Front
    7,700 American and Syngman Rhee Bandit Troops Annihilated in Five Days
    We Launched Local Counterattacks on the Eastern Front, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Enemy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 31st] Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to fiercely annihilate the invading enemy with staunch defensive and counter-offensive warfare on the eastern front, forcing their risky offensive to a temporary halt. Since the 18th, the American and Rhee troops, attempting to achieve their goals of a risky offensive, have deployed parts of seven divisions to the eastern front, with troop deployments for each target ranging from about two battalions to two regiments. However, under the staunch defense and counterattacks of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, the American and Rhee troops have made minimal progress on the eastern front, while suffering extremely severe losses. According to statistics from the 21st to the 25th: The Chinese and Korean People's forces annihilated more than 7,700 enemy troops, including more than 7,000 Rhee puppet troops and more than 400 American troops. In addition, 41 enemy aircraft were shot down or damaged in the skies over the front and rear areas. According to the confession of an officer of the 8th Division of the Rhee puppet army: The division suffered more than 1,400 casualties in one week, and the puppet capital division also suffered more than 1,000 casualties. From the 24th to the 26th, the American and Rhee troops launched fierce attacks on a certain mountainous area south of Xiangling, northeast of Yangkou, the 884 Heights northeast of Linjie, and other mountain tops, but were all repelled by our defending troops. In order to inflict more losses on the invading enemy, our defending troops have launched fierce counterattacks in various places for several consecutive days. On the 25th, after the enemy paid a heavy price to occupy Guhuang Peak and 345.4 Heights northwest of Gancheng on our east coast on the 24th, our defending troops launched a counterattack to drive the enemy out. A certain unit of our army guarding the mountainous area northeast of Yangkou also drove away the enemy occupying 983.1 Heights in a counterattack on the 25th, killing and wounding more than 300 of them. Another unit achieved brilliant results in annihilating more than 3,000 enemy troops in three counterattacks in the area northeast of Linjie. Incensed by the bandit behavior of the American aggressors in deliberately sabotaging the Kaesong truce talks, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese and Korean People's forces vowed to continue to crush any possible new adventurous offensive by the enemy.
     [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 31st] Our reporter reports: After repelling the risky offensive of the American and Rhee troops, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the eastern front launched counterattacks in local areas from the 26th, recovering the mountain tops along the Dumi-ri line north of Yangkou and the mountain tops along the line northeast of Yangkou. In the battle, the Korean and Chinese People's forces braved torrential rain, climbed mountains as high as thousands of meters, and passed through dense jungles, launching heroic and continuous assaults on the enemies who resisted stubbornly, annihilating rows and companies of American aggressor troops in the fortifications. A certain unit has recaptured the two important strongholds of Chenxian and Jiuxian and four important mountain tops along the Dumi-ri line, annihilating about two companies of American troops; in addition, one kilometer east of Gufang Mountain, they also defeated a company of American troops, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 300 American troops. In the Yangkou northeastern area, after two days of heroic counterattacks on the 26th and 27th, a certain unit recaptured several mountain tops east and southeast of Dayu Mountain, annihilating more than 400 Rhee puppet troops. In the Hwacheon northern area, a certain unit killed and wounded more than 150 invading enemies in a defensive battle on the highlands south of Heiyun Tuling. Another unit annihilated more than 100 enemies in a defensive battle on the highlands south of Hudong-ri. The Chinese and Korean People's forces guarding the central line area north of Jinhua and Tieyuan also repelled the attacks of small groups of enemies.
