Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: A correspondent from Jin Wanbao, Bei Quedi, reported from Kaesong on the 6th: Ridgeway has made a whole series of shameless lies in his reply to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai's protests regarding the violation of the neutral zone. However, these lies have been exposed by two of his own soldiers. Two members of Ridgeway's plundering forces are now prisoners. One, named Kim Bong-deuk, participated in the incident on August 30th, in which two neutral zone military police were murdered. He was captured on September 1st, the fifth time he had entered Kaesong in three weeks. He is a regular member of the Rhee Syngman puppet "National Defense Forces." His reconnaissance unit operates in uniform at night and in plain clothes during the day. He confessed that he led ten armed puppet soldiers in uniform to murder two military police within three miles of the city—two miles into the neutral zone. The next morning, he took the uniforms of the Rhee Syngman puppet soldiers back to his unit's headquarters outside the neutral zone.

Ridgeway's claim that his troops are not responsible for the shooting incidents and his counter-accusations that these incidents were fabricated within the neutral zone have been proven to be deliberate lies. These incidents all occurred in the Panmunjom area, which is the location of the South Korean puppet army's 1st Division. Baek Sun-yup, the South Korean armistice negotiator, was formerly the commander of this division. The South Korean puppet army has been organized into small units, and its main task is to invade the neutral zone. Is it possible that Ridgeway's investigation could not find the location of this unit? It is impossible. The confession of the second captured soldier, Park Rae-ryang, who was captured on September 3rd, has completely exposed the shameless attitude of the United States.

According to Park Rae-ryang, a week ago, a group of American officers traveled by helicopter to Panmunjom to deliver a letter from Joy shirking responsibility for the incident. Another group of officers landed east of Panmunjom and found eight armed personnel in uniform. The two American officers on the helicopter told the leader of this team, through an interpreter, that they had opened fire on Chinese military police in the neutral zone, and that troops crossing the neutral boundary would not be allowed to wear uniforms in the future. Since then, the strategy has been changed, and soldiers only wear uniforms at night. Park Rae-ryang was captured in a battle northeast of Panmunjom. Park Rae-ryang has two documents proving that he was engaged in "intelligence work."

Just like the evidence of the American side's attempt to murder the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese side through bombing, the evidence of the American side's lack of sincerity and their deliberate sabotage of the conference with ground troops is concrete and undeniable. The reasonable demand of the Korean-Chinese side for a serious investigation has been met with a series of brutal denials. Ridgeway, Joy, and Kenney themselves understand that these denials are utter lies.

    两个被捕的李匪军人员供词
    揭穿李奇微和乔埃彻头彻尾都是撒谎
     【新华社八日讯】今晚报记者贝却敌六日自开城报道：李奇微对金日成和彭德怀两将军抗议侵犯中立区事件所作的无耻答复中，撒了一整套谎，可是这些谎言却被他自己的两个士兵揭穿了。李奇微的劫掠部队中有两名人员现在成了俘虏。一个名叫金凤得，他参加过八月三十日的事件，在这次事件中，有两名中立区军事警察被杀害。他是在九月一日三周内第五次进入开城时被俘的。他是李承晚伪“国防军”的正规人员。他的侦察部队在夜晚穿军装进行活动，白天着便衣进行活动。他供认了他领着十名手持武器身穿军装的伪军在离开城三哩以内——进入中立区二哩——的地方谋杀两名军事警察。第二天早晨，他把李承晚伪军士兵的军装带回到在中立区以外的他的部队总部去。
    李奇微所说他的军队不能对射击事件负责的说法，以及他反咬这些事件是在中立区内制造的这些说法，已证明是蓄意撒谎。这些事件都是在板门店地区发生的，而板门店地区就是南朝鲜伪军第一师的驻地。南朝鲜停火谈判代表白善烨从前就是这个师的师长。南朝鲜傀儡军已编为小的单位，它的主要任务就是侵入中立区。难道李奇微的调查会找不到这个单位的驻地吗？不可能的。因为九月三日被俘的第二个俘虏士兵朴来良的供词已把美国的无耻态度完全揭穿了。
    据朴来良供称：在一个星期以前，美国一批军官乘直升飞机至板门店，递交乔埃的一份推卸事件责任的信件，另外一批军官在板门店以东地方降落，找到八个穿着军装的武装人员。直升飞机上的两个美国军官通过通译员对这一队人的队长说：已向中立区内的中国军事警察开火，越过中立界的部队今后不许穿军服了。从这以后，策略就改变了，士兵只在晚上才穿军服。朴来良是在板门店东北的一次战斗中被俘的。朴来良有两个证件，证明了他是干“情报工作”的。
    正如美方企图以轰炸来谋杀朝中方面首席代表的证据一样，美方没有诚意以及他们蓄意用地面部队破坏会议的罪证，是确确实实、不可抵赖了。朝中方面提出认真调查的合理要求，但得到的是一连串横蛮无理的否认。李奇微、乔埃与肯尼自己明白，这些否认彻头彻尾都是撒谎。
