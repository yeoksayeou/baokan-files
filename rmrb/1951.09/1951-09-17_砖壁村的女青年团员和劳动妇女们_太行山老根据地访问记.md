The Female Youth League Members and Working Women of Zhuanbi Village
—A Visit to the Old Revolutionary Base of Taihang Mountain
Lin Wei

On the afternoon of my arrival in Zhuanbi Village, Wuxiang, Shanxi Province, the village cadres introduced me to the production and living conditions of the whole village. When I returned and reviewed my notes, I found a contradiction. On the one hand, the village was very short of labor: 114 young and middle-aged people had gone out to join the army, work in factories, or work in government offices, leaving behind mostly old men and children, amounting to only about fifty or sixty full laborers. On the other hand, all of the village's 1,900 mu of arable land were located in high mountains and deep gullies, making cultivation very difficult. A full laborer, even with livestock, could only cultivate about 20 mu. However, on the other hand, production was rapidly recovering and developing. By last year, the production level had already exceeded that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, with each mu yielding 1.4 shi of grain (the pre-war level was 1.3 shi). It is estimated that this year will be even better. Among the 126 households in the village, more than 20 have now reached the level of "cultivating two and having surplus one," meaning that one year's agricultural income is enough for one and a half years of food, clothing, and expenses. More than 30 other households also have a surplus. The remaining general farming households, except for three households of orphans and widows, have all balanced their income and expenditure, no longer eat chaff, and no longer lack cotton trousers to wear in winter. During the War of Resistance, the village lost 29 head of cattle, which have now been completely replenished, and even exceeded by ten head.

What was the reason?

That night, I was led to the home of Li San, a peasant who had been emancipated, for dinner. During the meal, Li San sat on a newly placed white felt and told me about his past 30 years as a farmhand, the process of his gradual emancipation after the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, and the current prosperous living conditions of his family. At the most joyful point, he suddenly interjected, "There is also one thing that makes me feel satisfied—women are so liberated now! This girl my woman brought," he pointed to a rosy-cheeked girl sitting quietly on the edge of the kang, listening with a smile, "She is nineteen years old and her name is Mengyue. She has been liberated and has become like a young man! Carrying water, carrying manure, collecting manure, driving carts, plowing fields, hoeing seedlings, she can do everything that men do. In summer, she cuts wheat, and in autumn, she cuts grain. As soon as I finish cutting, she also finishes binding it. If it weren't for her, I would really be too busy!"

Li San's words gave me a hint, which suddenly made me think: perhaps women's participation in major agricultural labor is the main link, or one of the main links, in this village overcoming labor difficulties and enabling production to recover and develop.

The next day, I asked the village's Women's Federation Chairman, Ji Xitao, to tell me about the situation of women's participation in agricultural labor. According to her, the village had called on women to participate in agricultural labor since 1944, and some women had also participated in movements to reclaim wasteland, gather wild vegetables, and collect mountain fruits to survive the famine. However, on the one hand, because women were concentrated on doing their own things, which were divorced from the needs of the family; on the other hand, because the movement only mentioned overcoming labor difficulties and did not mention the issue of women's liberation, the movement lacked strength and could not be sustained. Later, the work was improved year by year, and women's education was strengthened, especially after the slogan of "Learning from Niu Jinhuan" (Niu was the first woman in the village to plow the fields automatically) was put forward, the progress was even faster. By 1948, women had officially participated in the mutual aid teams to which their families belonged, with labor points calculated and approved by the family. In the past two years, 35 women have been engaged in major agricultural labor year-round, more than 20 of whom can plow the fields, like Li Mengyue. Most women in the village also participate in seasonal labor, such as harvesting and transplanting seedlings. This year's wheat fields were plowed by women a lot, and there were several families where all the plowing was done by women. This freed up a lot of male labor to hoe the millet well (hoeing millet is the most difficult agricultural work), increasing autumn grain production.

After the introduction, I had a conversation with three young women that day. These three were Li Mengyue, Li Runhua, and Ma Lanxiang. The first two were Youth League members, both nineteen years old; the latter was eighteen years old. Their faces were childish and cheerful, without a trace of shadow. They told me triumphantly that since last year, they had been working in mutual aid teams, often getting full points (ten points), almost completely catching up with the men. It's just that they can't carry as heavy loads of manure as men, and they are a little slower when hoeing millet. But they have ways to make up for it: when carrying manure, they run faster and carry more trips. When hoeing millet, they rest less, or don't rest at all, and they can still catch up. Last year, in addition to doing general farming work such as planting, harvesting, etc., each of them plowed 15 to 20 mu of land, cultivated 6 to 8 mu of wheat land, picked 5 to 7 dan of sheep manure (1 dan is 40 jin), and cut 700 to 800 jin of artemisia. At noon and at night, they sometimes also do needlework (attending civil school on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th days of the month). Runhua also has to go home to cook because her mother has been ill for many years and cannot move.

Some people may think, "The men are gone, and women have no choice but to work. Life is forcing them!" This idea is wrong. Why? The following conversation record explains this:

I asked, "Why are you working so hard?"

Runhua answered, "If women want to be thoroughly liberated, they have to work on their own and not rely on men to support them. We are also Youth League members and should take the lead."

Mengyue and Lanxiang answered, "Young men are joining the army and going to the front to resist US aggression and aid Korea; young women should work hard in the rear, produce more grain to support the front; and we should also do a good job in substituting for the soldiers' families, so that the soldiers can fight with peace of mind."

In the old revolutionary base areas, even children know this kind of reasoning, which is not rare. But the important thing is that these principles have now become the guidelines for the actions of the general masses and have become an internal driving force. Li Runhua is a girl who started carrying coal at the age of eleven, but she doesn't look down on herself or her labor like girls used to. Someone in the village joked with her, "Your face is tanned, and you won't be able to find a partner." Her answer is very simple: "Anyone who dislikes me for being tanned doesn't understand labor. In the new society, he is a backward element with no future. I won't marry him!" What is called having a future! Another nineteen-year-old Youth League member, Li Eying, explained it this way: "In the past, a daughter-in-law became a mother-in-law, and that was the end of the road. Now, as long as you are willing to learn, willing to work, and have the ability, you are allowed to do any job. In the future, when our agricultural society moves to an industrial society and implements communism, we must also be at the forefront and not fall behind."

The women of Zhuanbi have become an emerging labor force under the guidance and impetus of such advanced ideas. Their labor is conscious, idealistic, and therefore powerful. Their conscious labor will not only promote the solution of labor difficulties in a passive way, but will also play a powerful role in the road of agricultural production development.

Li Pengfei, Secretary of the Wuxiang County Party Committee, mentioned the issue of women's labor as the first characteristic when introducing the characteristics of Wuxiang County's production movement in the past three years. Among the 140,000 people in Wuxiang, more than 10,000 joined the army and 4,000 to 5,000 left production to become revolutionary cadres. In total, the population that went out accounted for more than 10% of the total population (those who entered factories were not included in the statistics). According to statistics in 1950, the average production in 179 villages in the county exceeded 4.9% before the war, of which 104 villages exceeded 19.7% on average. This significant achievement is inseparable from the labor of women. According to statistics, in the past three years, 37% of the county's women have been engaged in major labor year-round, and 53% have participated in seasonal agricultural labor. Women's participation in labor, coupled with mutual aid and cooperation and technical improvements, is the main reason why Wuxiang has been able to overcome difficulties and restore production. The continued development of these conditions will enable production to advance more rapidly. In Zhuanbi, this trend of progress is also very clear. For example, in the past, the village was never accessible to vehicles (the village is on a mountain peak), but last year, after research by villager Li Haiyuan, he created a light and convenient animal-powered wooden vehicle for climbing mountains, which the masses called "Lian San Zhuan" (two wheels and one axle rotate together), completely replacing human labor for carrying coal and transporting public grain. With the efforts of the whole village, 15 out of 19 qing of land are now accessible to vehicles, and most of the manure and crops can also be transported by wooden vehicles. According to villagers' calculations, this vehicle can save more than 7,000 man-days a year, equivalent to the labor days of more than 20 full laborers in a year. This year, this vehicle has been widely adopted throughout the village and has begun to spread to other mountain villages. Like women's participation in labor, this improvement in technical conditions not only plays a role in overcoming labor difficulties, but will also play a role in promoting production.

    砖壁村的女青年团员和劳动妇女们
    ——太行山老根据地访问记
    林韦
    在我到达山西武乡砖壁村的当天下午，村干部们向我介绍了全村的生产和生活情况。回来翻记录，发现一个矛盾。一方面，该村劳动力非常缺乏：青壮年有一百十四人出外参加了部队、工厂生产和机关工作，留在村里的尽是些老汉和孩子，全部折算起来，不过五、六十个全劳动力；而全村一千九百亩耕地又都在高山上、深沟里，耕作十分困难，一个全劳动力加上牲口，只不过能种二十多亩。但另一方面，生产却在迅速地恢复、发展。至去年，生产水平即已超过抗日战争以前，每亩收粮达到一石四斗（战前水平为一石三斗）。今年，据估计还会更好一些。全村一百二十六户中，现在已有二十多户达到耕二余一，即一年农业收入够一年半吃、穿、用。另有三十多户都有了剩余。其余一般农户，除三户孤寡外，都已收支相抵，不再吃糠，冬天穿不上棉裤的也没有了。抗日期间全村损失二十九头牛，现已全部补齐，且超过十头。
    什么原因呢？
    夜里，我被领到翻身农民李三家里吃晚饭。饭间，李三坐在新置的白毡上，向我叙述他过去当长工三十年，到八路军来了以后逐步翻身的经过和目前家中丰裕的生活情形。说到最高兴的地方，他忽然插了一段说：“还有一样使我感到满意的——现在的妇女可解放好啦！俺女人带来的这个闺女，”他指指坐在炕沿上安静地微笑着倾听的一个脸色红润的姑娘对我说，“她十九岁啦，名儿叫梦月，她解放得成了个小后生啦！担水，担粪，打粪，赶车，犁地，锄苗，凡是男人干的活她都能干。夏天割麦，秋天割谷，我刚割好她也就捆绑好啦。要不是她，我一个人可真是忙不过来呀！”
    李三这段话给我一个提示，使我忽然想到：妇女参加农业主要劳动，或许就是这村克服劳动力困难，使生产得到恢复、发展的主要环节或主要环节之一。
    第二天，我请村妇联主席籍希桃告诉我一些妇女参加农业劳动的情形。据她说，该村从一九四四年起就号召妇女参加农业劳动，也有部分妇女参加过开荒、打野菜、采山果度荒的运动。但是一方面由于妇女集中起来干自己的，与家庭的需要脱离；另一方面由于在运动中只提到克服劳动力困难，没有提到妇女解放问题上，所以运动没有力量，也不能持久。以后逐年改进工作，加强妇女教育，特别是“学习牛金焕”（牛系该村最先自动犁地的妇女）的口号提出之后，进展就更快了。到一九四八年，妇女即正式参加自己家庭所属的互助组，以劳计分，得到家庭赞许。最近两年，长年参加农业主要劳动的妇女已有三十五人，其中二十多人已能犁地，像李梦月一样。村中一般妇女，也都参加了季节性的劳动，如收割、拔苗之类。今年的麦地，女人耕的很多，有好几家全部是妇女耕了的。这样就省出许多男劳动力去好好锄谷（锄谷是农活中最难的），增产秋粮。
    经过介绍，当天我和三个女青年谈了一次话。这三个人是李梦月、李润花、马兰香。前两个是青年团员，均十九岁；后一个十八岁。她们的面孔稚气而快活，找不到一丝阴影。她们得意地告诉我，去年以来，她们在互助组里劳动，时常得全分（十分），差不多完全赶上了男的。就是担粪时总不如男人担的重，锄谷时也稍为慢一点。但她们有补救的办法：担粪时跑快些，多担几遭。锄谷时少休息，或不休息，还是能赶上去。去年一年，她们除做一般养种、收割……等农活外，每个人都翻地十五亩到二十亩，耕麦地六亩到八亩，拾羊粪五担到七担（一担四十斤），割蒿七百斤到八百斤。午间和夜间，有时还做针线活（每逢三、六、九上民校）。润花因为母亲长年害病不能动，她还得自己回家做饭。
    有人会想：“男人走了，女人不想劳动也不行，生活逼着哩！”这种想法是错的，为什么呢？下面的谈话记录便说明了这一点：
    我问：“你们为什么要这样拚命干呢？”
    润花答：“妇女要澈底解放，就得自己劳动，不靠男的养活。咱又是青年团员，应该起带头作用。”
    梦月、兰香答：“男青年参军，到前线抗美援朝；女青年就应该在后方好好劳动，多产粮食，支援前线；还要把代耕搞好，叫战士们安心作战。”
    在老根据地，这类道理连孩子也是知道的，并不稀奇。但要紧的是，这些道理现在已经成了一般群众行动的指针，成了内在的动力。李润花，是一个从十一岁起就开始担煤的女孩子，但她一点不像过去的女孩一样自己轻看自己，轻看自己的劳动。村里有人开她的玩笑：“脸晒黑了，找不着对象。”她的回答很简单：“谁要嫌我晒黑了，他就是对劳动没认识，在新社会里他是落后分子，没前途，我还不找他哩！”什么叫有前途呢！另一个十九岁的女青年团员李娥英这样解释：“从前媳妇熬成婆，就算到头了。现在只要自己肯学习，肯劳动，有能力，什么工作都许干。将来咱这农业社会要走到工业社会，实行共产主义，咱也要走在前头，不要落在后头。”
    砖壁的妇女，就是在这样先进的思想指引和推动下成为新兴的劳动力量。她们的劳动是自觉的、有理想的，因而也是强有力的。她们的自觉劳动，将不仅止于在消极方面促进劳动力困难的解决，而且将在农业生产发展前进的道路上起其强大作用。
    武乡县委书记李鹏飞同志在介绍近三年来武乡县生产运动的特点时，第一条就提到妇女劳动的问题。武乡十四万人口中，有一万多人参军，四、五千人脱离生产，当了革命干部。总计出外人口占总人口百分之十以上（进工厂的未统计在内）。据一九五○年统计，全县一七九村，生产平均超过战前百分之四·九，其中一○四村平均超过一九·七。这一重大成绩，和妇女的劳动是分不开的。据统计，近三年来，全县妇女已有百分之三十七常年参加主要劳动，百分之五十三参加季节性农业劳动。妇女参加劳动加上互助合作，技术改良，这就是武乡能够克服困难，恢复生产的主要原因。这些条件的继续发展，将使生产更加迅速地前进。在砖壁，这种前进的趋势也显得很明白。举一个例来说，过去该村从来不通车（村在山巅），但去年经过村民李海元研究，已经创制了一种爬山用的轻便畜力木车，群众称为“连三转”（二轮一轴一齐转动），全部代替了人力担煤和担运公粮。又经全村努力，现在十九顷地已经有十五顷可以通车，担粪、担庄稼，也大部可以用木车代替了。据村人计算，用此车一年可以节省七千多人工，相当于二十多个全劳动力一年的劳动日。今年这种车已被全村普遍采用，并开始向其他山庄发展。和妇女参加劳动一样，这种技术条件的改进不仅在克服劳动力困难上起其作用，且将在推进生产上起其作用。
