The Story of Soviet Experts Rescuing Chinese Disaster Victims
Xinhua News Agency Reporters Hong Liu, Lin Yin, Li Zhilun

Comrade Durasov, a Soviet expert and Director of the Shenyang Branch of the China Changchun Railway; with his lofty Bolshevik spirit, he bravely rescued many disaster victims near Kaiyuan County who had suffered from floods, earning the infinite love and respect of the local Chinese people.

On August 20th, reporters visited the disaster victim reception center in Kaiyuan City. We saw a mute woman from Langjia Village, Kaiyuan County, who had been rescued by Soviet expert Durasov from the turbulent floodwaters under the Qinghe Bridge. She stroked the baby who was nursing in her arms with one hand, and with the other hand gestured to the reporters, then suddenly pointed to a picture on the wall of Stalin with children, smiling gratefully. The five children of disaster victim Li Huanghao, who were next to her, competed to tell the reporters how they had been rescued from the flood by Soviet expert Durasov with ropes.

On August 14th, the section of the China Changchun Railway between Tieling and Changtu suffered the worst flood in decades. At 1:30 PM that day, Durasov, Director of the Shenyang Branch of the China Changchun Railway, and his party arrived at Qinghe Bridge in the pouring rain to understand the flood situation and the condition of the bridge and roadbed. At this time, the water level of the Qinghe River rose very sharply, with the water surface only a little over a meter away from the bottom of the bridge's steel beams, and the villages on both sides of the Qinghe River had turned into a watery expanse. Durasov was watching the rapid currents of the Qinghe River when he suddenly discovered that grass huts, weeds, trees, pigs, cattle, and other things were being washed down the river by the flood, and on some of the roofs were women tightly holding their children, shouting "Help!"

Durasov felt very distressed when he saw many farmers and children being washed down by the flood. At this time, the bridgehead where he was located was already very dangerous and could be submerged at any time, but he forgot about himself. He ran back and forth on the bridge, telling the soldiers and workers guarding the bridge to quickly throw ropes, blankets, planks, and everything else that could be used to save people into the water to rescue the disaster victims. Many soldiers and workers who could swim, inspired by Durasov, also bravely jumped into the water to save people.

In this way, by 3:00 PM, they had rescued forty-two people from the water, including twenty-eight children under the age of fifteen. These children had been squatting on the roofs being washed by the flood for a long time and were all shivering. Durasov rubbed the children's bodies and looked at the still-rising flood in the river. He said, "The children are the most hopeful, let's send them away first." He ordered the driver to use his own light oil vehicle to immediately send the first batch of rescued children and adults to Kaiyuan, and then come back to take them out of the danger zone.

The roaring sound of the Qinghe River under the bridge drowned out the sound of the light oil vehicle driving away. Soon, a bridge on the road to Kaiyuan was also washed away, and the light oil vehicle could no longer return. At this time, the sky was gradually darkening, and the land at the Qinghe Bridgehead had become an isolated island in a vast expanse of water. Most of the food supplies of the bridge-guarding troops were also washed away by the flood. But the soldiers were moved by Durasov's great internationalist spirit and even more bravely rescued disaster victims in the cold and rapid floodwaters, saving a total of more than one hundred and fifty people.

The last person to be rescued was Yuan Yongchang, a thirteen-year-old boy from Huayuan Village near Qinghe Bridge. He was washed under the Daqinghe Bridge by the flood at dusk on the 14th. He struggled to climb onto the inclined beam under the steel beam, but could not climb up. He froze on the inclined beam for a long time. At midnight, Durasov was inspecting the bridge when he suddenly heard a child's groan coming from under the bridge. He leaned down and peered through the gaps in the sleepers, and found a child climbing on the inclined beam. He immediately ordered the bridge-watching workers to cut the pressure beam with an ax and open the sleepers to lower a rope to save the child. At that time, the bridge-watching workers hesitated, hoping to find other ways to save the child, but Durasov firmly said, "The child will freeze to death if he stays under the bridge for too long, we can't wait, the pressure beam can be repaired, but people are the most valuable asset." This last discovered child was finally rescued onto the bridge under Durasov's firm order.

After midnight, the disaster victims who had been rescued ashore squatted at the bridgehead, hungry and cold. The soldiers guarding the bridge took out the little food they had left to give to the disaster victims, and some soldiers took off their own clothes to give to the disaster victims. They themselves had hardly eaten all day and stayed up until the next day. The next day, the Kaiyuan County People's Government successively organized lifeboats to send Durasov, the soldiers, the workers, and a large number of disaster victims from the flood-surrounded bridgehead to Kaiyuan. When the disaster victims parted with Durasov, they were moved to tears and said, "The Soviet comrades and soldiers treat us so well, they are even closer than our own relatives."

    苏联专家抢救中国灾民的故事
    新华社记者  洪流  林印  李致伦
    中长路沈阳分局局长苏联专家杜拉索夫；以他布尔塞维克的崇高精神，奋勇抢救出开原县附近许多遭受水灾的灾民，博得当地中国人民无限的敬爱。
    八月二十日，记者访问了开原城内的灾民招待所。看见一个被苏联专家杜拉索夫从清河桥下湍急的洪水中救起来的开原县郎家村的一个哑叭妇女。她一只手抚摩着正在她怀里吃奶的孩子，另一只手向记者比划着手势，又突然指着墙上一幅斯大林和孩子们在一起的图画，感激地微笑着。在她旁边的灾民李黄镐的五个孩子这时争着代替哑叭妇女告诉记者他们如何被苏联专家杜拉索夫从洪水中用绳子救起来的经过情形。
    八月十四日，中长路铁岭、昌图间的线路遭到数十年来没有过的大水灾。当天下午一点半钟，中长路沈阳分局局长杜拉索夫和一行人在倾盆大雨中到达清河桥头，了解涨水情况和桥梁路基状态。这时，清河的水势上涨非常猛烈，水面距桥钢梁的底部只差一公尺多，清河两岸的村庄尽都变成了泽国。杜拉索夫正在注视着清河的急流，忽然发现河中有草屋的房屋、紫草、树木、猪、牛等被洪水冲流下来，有的房盖上有妇女紧抱着孩子，喊着“救命”。
    杜拉索夫眼看到许多农民和孩子被洪水冲下来，感到非常难受。这时，他所在的桥头已经非常危险，随时有被淹没的可能，但他忘记了自己，他在桥上来回奔跑，告诉守桥的战士和工人赶紧把绳子、被单、木板等一切可以用来救人的东西抛到水中去抢救灾民。许多会游水的战士和工人在杜拉索夫的感召下，也奋不顾身地跳下水去救人。
    就这样，到了下午三点钟，他们已经从水中救出四十二个人，其中十五岁以下的小孩子有二十八个。这些孩子们蹲在房盖上被洪水冲激了许多时间，都在打着寒颤。杜拉索夫摩摩孩子们的身体，看看河里仍在猛涨的洪水。他说：“孩子们是最有希望的，先把他们送走。”他命令司机用他自己的轻油车，先将第一批被救起的孩子和大人立刻送到开原去，然后再回来接他们脱离危险区。
    清河桥下汹涌的水声，盖过了轻油车开走的声音。不久，往开原路上的一处桥梁也被冲断了，轻油车不可能再开回来。这时，天色已逐渐黑暗，清河桥头的陆地已成为一片汪洋中的孤岛。守桥部队的大部分存粮也被洪水冲走。但战士们被杜拉索夫的伟大的国际主义精神所感动，都更加勇猛地在冰凉而湍急的洪水中抢救灾民，前后共救起了一百五十多人。
    最后被救起的是清河桥附近花园村的一个十三岁的男小孩袁永昌。他被洪水冲到大清河桥下时，已经是十四日的傍晚，他努力爬上了钢梁下部的斜梁上，但是无法爬上来。他在斜梁上冻了很久。到午夜时候，杜拉索夫在桥上巡视，他突然听见了一个小孩的呻呤声从桥底下传上来，他倒下身子，从枕木缝中窥视，发现一个孩子正在斜梁上爬。他立刻命令看桥工人用斧子把压梁木砍断，拨开枕木放下绳子去救孩子。当时，看桥工人有些踌躇，他们希望想出其他办法来救小孩，可是杜拉索夫坚决地说：“小孩在桥下久了会冻死，不能等了，压梁木断了可以再修，而人是最宝贵的财产。”这个最后被发现的孩子，终于在杜拉索夫的坚决命令下被救上桥来了。
    午夜以后，被抢救上岸的灾民蹲在桥头又饿又冷。守桥的战士们就把他们仅剩下的一点粮食拿出给灾民吃，有的战士把自己的衣服脱下给灾民穿。他们自己却差不多整天没有吃饭，一直熬到第二天。第二天开原县人民政府先后组织了救生船，从洪水包围的桥头把杜拉索夫、战士、工人和大批灾民送到开原去。当灾民和杜拉索夫分开时，他们感动得流下眼泪说：“苏联同志和战士们待我们这样好，简直比亲人还亲。”
