    Adopt a Correct Attitude Towards Studying Party History

    The direct subordinate organizations in Mianchi County, Henan Province, were very careless in their study of Party history. At the beginning, everyone was very enthusiastic about studying Party history; after a week, due to a lack of leadership, enthusiasm gradually declined. Finally, in order to conclude this stage of study, they hastily read through the sections on the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the period after the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the basic summary of the past thirty years in three days, and ended it hastily. Many comrades did not truly understand the spirit and essence of the documents.

    Some comrades mistakenly believed that since they had personally participated in the revolutionary struggles since the War of Resistance Against Japan, there was no need to study these historical struggles again. This empiricist view became a stumbling block for many comrades in their study. It should be pointed out that the Party's thirty-year history of struggle is indivisible and must be studied seriously in its entirety. Those who have personally participated in the revolutionary struggles since the War of Resistance Against Japan have directly experienced the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought in practice, and should study even more diligently to elevate their perceptual understanding of such great revolutionary struggles to a rational understanding.

    对党史学习要持正确的态度
    河南渑池县直属机关，对党史学习，非常草率。开始时，大家学习党史的热情很高；一周以后由于缺乏领导，热情即逐渐下降。最后为了结束这一阶段的学习，以三天时间把党史中的抗日战争时期、第三次国内革命战争时期、中华人民共和国成立以后及三十年来基本总结等部分，粗读一遍，草草结束。很多同志没有真正领会了文件的精神与实质。
    有些同志错误地以为自己亲身参加了抗日战争以来的革命斗争，就不必再学习这些斗争历史。这种经验主义的看法，成为很多同志学习的绊脚石。应当指出，党的三十年斗争史是不可分割的，必须全部认真地学习。亲身参加了抗日战争以来革命斗争的人，在实践中已直接体验到毛泽东思想的伟大，更应该认真学习，使自己对这样伟大的革命斗争，从感性的认识提高到理性的认识。
