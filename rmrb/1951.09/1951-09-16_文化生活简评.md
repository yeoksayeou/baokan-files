Brief Review of Cultural Life

    Strengthen Leadership over Serial Picture Books

    Strengthening leadership over the creation, research, and publication of serial picture books has attracted the attention of cultural authorities in various regions. Following the publication of the bi-monthly "Lianhuanhua Pictorial" by the Beijing People's Fine Arts Publishing House, the East China People's Publishing House also recently published "Worker-Peasant Pictorial," with the first issue selling 230,000 copies. In August, the Culture Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles convened a fine arts work conference, resolving to create 100 high-quality serial picture books in the next year and a half. The Northeast Daily also published a special article on this, calling on fine arts workers to create serial picture books with educational significance and gradually drive out harmful serial picture books from the market. This is of great significance for improving the quality of serial picture books and conducting in-depth and widespread education among the masses in the future. Currently, some publishers adopt a crude and sloppy attitude towards the publication of serial picture books, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Many readers have written to newspapers criticizing these serial picture books with political errors and requesting that the leading authorities conduct strict reviews. Recently, the Fine Arts Department of the Art Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the Popular Periodicals Department of the General Administration of Publications, the News Office of the Beijing People's Government, and the National Artists Association, among other units, jointly formed the "Serial Picture Book Research Office" in Beijing. Its task is to strengthen the research of serial picture book publications and assist the leading authorities in conducting review work, and to systematically recommend good works to the masses and criticize bad works.

    The News Office of the Beijing People's Government and the News Office of the Hunan People's Government have both conducted investigations into local serial picture book stalls, understanding the sales of new and old serial picture books among the masses, and formulated plans to strengthen the education and transformation of the book stalls, and stipulate the review criteria for serial picture books. This is important and beneficial work. Because only through such detailed investigation work can effective measures be decided to promote serial picture books with educational significance and gradually eliminate harmful serial picture books.

    "Translation Bulletin" Discusses the Translation
    of Marxist-Leninist Classics

    The "Translation Bulletin" Volume 3, Issue 2, puts forward constructive suggestions on the translation of Marxist-Leninist classics. The article "It is Necessary to Improve the Quality of Translation Work" points out: "Although many Marxist-Leninist classics have been translated, very few are satisfactory. The main reason is that the theoretical level of the translators is not high enough." The article advocates that great efforts must be made to properly reorganize the translated works of Marxist-Leninist classics, and to re-translate or re-proofread those that need to be re-translated or re-proofread, and to translate the parts that are urgently needed but have not yet been translated. The article "Opinions on the Translation of Marxist-Leninist Classics" cites several translated examples to illustrate the shortcomings in the translated versions of Marxist-Leninist classics; and points out that, in order to overcome these shortcomings, in addition to having correct translation theories and methods as guidance, it is also necessary to organize forces to carry out collective translation. Not only should the original text be repeatedly read, repeatedly studied, and repeatedly discussed; but also the translated text should be repeatedly read, repeatedly discussed, and repeatedly proofread before the task of disseminating Marxism-Leninism can be completed. The article "'Capital' in Several Chinese Translations" made a comparative study of several translations of "Capital" published in China since 1930. The article quoted Leontiev's words, saying that "'Capital' 'from the day it was published to the present, has always been one of the sharpest weapons of the working class in the struggle for socialism,' and therefore the translated version of this book should be required to be the most precise and accurate." It is hoped that the revision work of the Wang Yanan and Guo Dali co-translation currently underway can be more precise and accurate, and that it can be completed as soon as possible.

    文化生活简评
    加强对连环图画的领导
    加强领导连环图画的创作、研究和出版工作，已经引起各地文化机关的重视。北京人民美术出版社出版了“连环画报”半月刊后，华东人民出版社也在最近出版了“工农画报”，创刊号的销数已达二十三万册。八月份东北人民政府文化部和东北文联召开了美术工作会议，决议在今后一年半内创作一百册质量较好的连环画。东北日报并为此发表专论，号召美术工作者创造有教育意义的连环画，逐渐在市场上驱逐有害的连环画。这对于今后提高连环画的质量，向群众进行深入和普及的教育是有很大作用的。目前有些出版商对连环画的出版工作采取了一种粗制滥造的不严肃的态度，引起群众不满。许多读者向报纸写信批评这些有政治错误的连环画，并要求领导机关严格进行审查。最近在北京由中央人民政府文化部艺术事业管理局美术处、出版总署通俗期刊司、北京市人民政府新闻处、全国美协等七个单位组成了“连环画研究室”。它的任务就是加强对连环画出版物的研究和协助领导机关进行审查工作，有计划地向群众推荐好的作品和批评坏的作品。
    北京市人民政府新闻处，湖南省人民政府新闻处都对当地的连环画书摊进行了调查，了解了新旧连环画在群众中销行的情况，作出了计划，加强对书摊的教育和改造工作，并规定对连环画的审查标准。这是重要和有益的工作。因为只有经过这种详细的调查工作，才能决定采取有效的措施，来推广有教育意义的连环画而逐渐消灭有害的连环画。
    “翻译通报”讨论马列主义
    经典著作的翻译问题
    “翻译通报”三卷二期，对翻译马列主义经典著作，提出了建设性的意见。“必须提高翻译工作的质量”一文指出：“马列主义的经典著作固然已经翻译出不少，但是能令人满意的实在太少了。主要的原因就是译者的理论水平不够。”该文主张必须用大力把马列主义经典著作的译品好好整理过，需要重译或重校的，加以重译或重校，把急需译出而还没有译出的部分译出来。“对翻译马列主义经典著作的意见”一文引证了若干译例，说明了马列主义经典著作译本中的缺点；并指出，要克服这些缺点，除了要有正确的翻译理论和翻译方法作指导以外，还要组织力量，进行集体翻译。不但要把原文反复阅读、反复研究、反复讨论；而且要把译文反复阅读、反复讨论、再三校正，才能完成传播马列主义的任务。“‘资本论’的几种中译本”一文就我国自一九三○年以来出版的几种“资本论”译本，作了比较研究。该文引用列昂节夫的话说：“资本论”“从它出版的一天起，直至现今，一直是工人阶级为社会主义斗争的最锐利武器之一”，因而应该要求这一部书的译本达到最精密、最正确的程度。希望正在进行的王亚南、郭大力合译本的修订工作能够做到更精密、更正确的程度，并早日使它完成。
