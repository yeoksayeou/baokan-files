How the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Was Summarized

Xinhua News Agency Reporter Men Hong

    The summarization of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method underwent a winding process. The entire summarization process was a struggle between old and new ideas. Hao Jianxiu once told the reporter: "During the 'Red May' production competition last year, I only produced five or six liang of white cotton per day. At that time, some sisters in the workshop suspected me, some thought I was playing tricks and hiding the white cotton; some even satirized and attacked me, suggesting that administrative personnel monitor me. But the Communist Party and Youth League cadres in the factory encouraged me not to lose heart! So I continued to work hard, humbly learning some of the advantages of the veteran workers, and as a result, I produced even less white cotton. When summarizing the Red May production competition, I was rated as a second-class model worker."

    The workers' doubts about the Hao Jianxiu Work Method were dispelled by the facts, but the work of summarizing this advanced work method took a detour. In February of this year, the factory's Communist Party, administrative, and trade union organizations began to summarize Hao Jianxiu's advanced experience. At that time, they only looked at the surface and roughly summarized "three diligences and three quicks—diligent eyes, quick to see; diligent legs, quick to run; diligent hands, quick to piece…". Li Guodong, a fine yarn worker from Jinan Renfeng Textile Mill, first learned the "three diligences and three quicks" and started running around the work area during shifts... Although a little less white cotton was produced, the labor intensity increased, making his legs and back ache, and he couldn't keep it up. The Huang Renmei group of Qingdao State-owned Cotton Mill No. 5 also tested "three diligences and three quicks" with poor results. The first summary thus failed.

        In early June, the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union of China sent a working group to Qingdao, which, in cooperation with the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union of China and the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, formed a Hao Jianxiu Work Method Research Committee. In addition to engineers and Party, League, and trade union cadres, fifteen fine yarn workers were also included in the research work. The committee set up five groups: piecing action, piecing time, cleaning action, cleaning time, and action sequence. For the first two days, they went to the factory to observe and measure Hao Jianxiu's work on the spot, and then carried out detailed and precise analysis and research. According to Liu Zuomin, Chairman of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Research Committee, "The success of this summary is inseparable from learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." When they started studying the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, everyone felt clueless. Later, they studied the "Stakhanov's Labor Method in Soviet Cotton Mills" published in "China Textiles" and gained the following three important experiences, which were specifically applied to this research and summary work.

    (1) In the past, when judging the technical level of a fine yarn worker, they only looked at how many seconds it took to piece a thread and how long it took to change the roving, paying no attention to other work. Through learning, they learned that the way to improve labor productivity is not just the speed of individual actions. How to plan and organize working time is a decisive factor, so they paid close attention to this point in the research. (2) They carried out the work of writing down the workday in detail, continuously recording every action of the worker. Due to the detailed recording of the work, many advantages of Hao Jianxiu's operation were discovered, such as when and under what circumstances to do what, combining several tasks, and cleaning in sections instead of all at once. (3) They carried out comparative work. In this summary, they not only studied Hao Jianxiu's work method, but also studied the work methods of other workers in Factory No. 6, and further compared the two work methods to see the characteristics of Hao Jianxiu's work method. For example, Hao Jianxiu had a fixed route for patrolling, taking care of both sides of the machine; while others did not have a fixed patrol route, piecing the thread whenever it broke, resulting in running around, wasting flowers, and wasting effort.

    Due to the application of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the committee repeatedly studied and discussed the characteristics of Hao Jianxiu's operating skills based on the measured results, and finally concluded that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method revolves around reducing thread breakage and shortening thread breakage time. Its main characteristics are regular patrols, skillful planning of work time, appropriate distribution of various tasks in each patrol, and using the saved time for cleaning work, thus reducing thread breakage and the amount of roller waste.

    The combination of engineers' theoretical knowledge and workers' technical experience is an important factor for the success of summarizing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The fine yarn workers who participated in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Research Committee were very familiar with fine yarn production. They paid close attention to every small action of Hao Jianxiu in their research work and discovered many special actions of Hao Jianxiu. For example, they discovered that when Hao Jianxiu pushed the wooden bobbin box, she always placed the two wooden bobbin boxes side by side, tightly close to each other, and held the top of the two wooden bobbin boxes with her left hand and pushed them forward. After engineers analyzed and researched, everyone understood that doing so could avoid the bobbins from tipping out and save time. Some technicians once thought that Hao Jianxiu's action of keeping the wiping board in her hand was a waste of time. However, fine yarn workers were able to deeply appreciate the benefits of keeping the wiping board in hand because of their technical experience. They believed that doing so was not only for cleaning the leaf board, but also for carefully checking whether each spindle had broken threads and abnormal phenomena, and would not cause people to run around without following the patrol route. Finally, they affirmed that keeping the wiping board in hand was an excellent action.

    Through this summary, not only was Hao Jianxiu's advanced work method summarized, but more importantly, it gave the staff participating in the work a further understanding of the importance of discovering and summarizing advanced work experience, especially giving the technicians a very profound education. For example, some engineers believed that the Japanese and British textile work methods were good before the summary; they felt that a young female worker who had been working for less than two years and was only seventeen years old, who was cultivated under the leadership of the Communist Party, was somewhat "insignificant." However, after this summary, their blind worship of capitalist ideas was broken. Engineer Li Hanqing said afterwards: "I didn't believe that Comrade Hao Jianxiu had such good results in the past, and thought it was impossible. This summary gave me a great lesson!"

    郝建秀工作法是怎样总结出来的？
    新华社记者  门宏
    郝建秀工作法的总结工作是经过一段曲折的。整个总结过程是一个新旧思想斗争的过程。郝建秀曾对记者说：“去年红五月生产竞赛时，我每天只出五、六两白花。当时车间里有些姊妹们怀疑，有的认为我耍鬼、把白花藏起来了；有的还讽刺打击我，建议行政人员监视我。可是厂里共产党和青年团的干部鼓励我不要灰心！于是我就继续努力，虚心学习老工人的一些优点，结果出的白花更少了。红五月生产竞赛总结时，我被评为二等模范。”
    工人们对郝建秀工作法的怀疑被事实消除了，但总结这一先进工作法的工作却走了一段弯路。今年二月份该厂共产党、行政和工会组织开始总结郝建秀的先进经验，当时只从表面上一看，就粗枝大叶地总结出“三勤、三快——眼勤、看的快；腿勤、跑的快；手勤、接头快……”。济南仁丰纱厂细纱工李国栋首先学了“三勤三快”，上了班就在车档里跑起来……。虽然白花少出了一点，可是增加了劳动强度，累得腿痛腰酸，不能坚持下去。青岛国棉五厂黄人美小组试验“三勤三快”，效果也不好。第一次的总结就这样失败了。
        六月初，中国纺织工会全国委员会派工作组到青岛，配合中国纺织工会青岛市委员会和华东纺织管理局青岛分局组成了郝建秀工作法研究委员会，其中除了工程师和党、团、工会干部还吸收了十五位细纱工人参加研究工作。委员会下设接头动作、接头时间、清洁动作、清洁时间、动作程序等五个组。开始两天，他们到厂实地观察与测定郝建秀的工作，接着即进行细致、精密的分析研究工作。据郝建秀工作法研究委员会主任委员刘祚民说：“这次总结的成功，是与学习苏联先进经验分不开的。”在开始研究郝建秀工作法的时候，大家感到茫无头绪。以后他们学习了“中国纺织”上所载的“苏联棉纺厂中斯塔哈诺夫的劳动方法”，取得以下三点重要经验，并具体运用到这次研究总结工作中去。
    （一）过去看一个细纱工技术高低时，只是看接头几秒钟、换粗纱多长时间，对于其他工作就不加以注意；通过了学习，他们知道了提高劳动生产率的办法不仅仅是个别的动作快慢，如何计划与组织工作时间是具有决定性因素的，因此在研究中就十分注意了这一点。（二）进行了工作日写实的工作，把工作者每一个动作都连续地记下来。由于进行了工作写实，发现了郝建秀操作中很多优点，如什么时候、什么情况下干什么活，几项工作结合起来做，清洁工作不是一次做而是分段做等。（三）进行了对比的工作。在这次总结中不仅是研究了郝建秀的工作法，同时也研究了六厂其他工人的工作法，并进一步的把两种工作法做一比较，从这对比中看出了郝建秀的工作法有那些特点。如郝建秀巡回有一定的路线，照看着机械的两面；而其他人则没有一定的巡回路线，看见断头就接，结果乱跑一阵，多放了花，多出了力。
    由于运用了苏联的先进经验，委员会把郝建秀在操作技术上的特点，根据测定的结果，进行了反复的研究讨论，最后总结出：郝建秀工作法是一切工作环绕着减少断头和缩短断头进行的。她的主要特点是巡回有规律、善于计划自己的工作时间，把各项工作适当地分配在每一次巡回中，把节约下来的时间用在清洁工作上，因此少断头，少出了皮辊花。
    工程师理论知识和工人技术经验的结合，对于总结郝建秀工作法的成功，是一个重要因素。参加郝建秀工作法研究委员会的细纱工人，对细纱生产都非常熟悉，她们在研究工作中对郝建秀的每一个细小的动作都非常注意，发现了郝建秀很多特殊动作。如她们发现了郝建秀推运木管匣时，总是将两个木管盒并列紧靠，左手握住两个木管盒的顶端向前推进。经过工程师们分析研究，大家明白了这样做，可以避免木管倾出，又节约了时间。个别技术人员在研究中曾认为郝建秀擦板不离手是一种浪费时间的动作。但细纱工人却因为她们有技术经验而能深刻体会到擦板不离手的好处。她们认为这样做不仅仅是为了清洁叶子板，同时又可以仔细地检查到每一个锭子有没有断头和不正常的现象，并且不致使人不依巡回路线而乱跑。最后肯定了擦板不离手是一个很杰出的动作。
    通过这次总结，不仅总结出郝建秀的先进工作法，更重要的是给予参加工作的人员进一步认识到发现和总结先进工作经验的重要性，特别是给了技术人员一个极深刻的教育。如有的工程师在总结之前，认为日本、英国的纺织工作法好；对于在共产党领导培育下一个不足二年工龄、十七岁的青年女工，就感到有些“微不足道”。可是经过这次总结，他们这种盲目崇拜资本主义的思想就被打破了。李汉卿工程师事后说：“我过去不相信郝建秀同志有这样好的成绩，认为是不可能的事，通过这次总结给我上了一大课！”
