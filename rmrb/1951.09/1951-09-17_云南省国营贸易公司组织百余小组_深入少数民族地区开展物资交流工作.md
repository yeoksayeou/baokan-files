    The Yunnan Provincial State-Owned Trading Company has organized more than 110 trade groups to go deep into minority areas to carry out material exchanges, with excellent results. Because the minority areas are sparsely populated, with few markets, sluggish sales of local products, and a lack of daily necessities, these trade groups have adopted a trade policy that combines the acquisition of local products with the promotion of daily necessities, and a business method that combines fixed operations with mobile street vending. In areas where minority villages are densely distributed and there are already some primary markets, the trade groups mainly engage in fixed operations, supplemented by mobile street vending. In places where villages are extremely scarce and there are only one or two gatherings for trade in half a year, the trade groups carry goods, traveling back and forth between mountainous areas of two or three hundred miles, to conduct transactions in the villages where minorities live. At the same time, they select suitable locations to carry out retail and wholesale business, helping minorities gradually establish some primary markets. In this way, the difficulty of selling local specialties and the shortage of salt and cloth has been initially alleviated in many ethnic groups. For example, the four trade groups operating in the Yi, Miao, and Lisu minority areas of Wuding County purchased more than 37,000 zhang of linen and large quantities of saltpeter, Tuckahoe, and other local products in the second quarter of this year alone, totaling more than 300 million yuan. At the same time, they supplied more than 4,000 pieces of cotton cloth, more than 16,000 jin of salt, and other daily necessities, totaling more than 280 million yuan.
    In addition, these trade groups also entrusted Han merchants engaged in trade in minority areas to collect local products and promote agricultural tools, and also signed verbal supply and marketing agreements with minorities. After the minorities concentrated their local products and delivered them to the trade groups or branch companies, the company or group immediately paid the payment and freight. If the minorities need to buy goods, they are priced at the company's wholesale price and can be purchased on credit. In this way, the difficulty of insufficient manpower of the state-owned trading company has been overcome, and the commercial network in the minority areas has been gradually restored and developed. For example, in the winter of last year, no minorities came to the Wuding County State-Owned Trading Branch to do business; after the above-mentioned methods were implemented, this year there are often twenty or thirty minorities carrying local products from one or two hundred miles away to trade in the city.
    The Yunnan Provincial State-Owned Trading Company has also absorbed some minority cadres to participate in trade work, which has played a great role in the development of trade work in minority areas. (Xinhua News Agency)

    云南省国营贸易公司组织百余小组
    深入少数民族地区开展物资交流工作
    云南省国营贸易公司的一百一十多个贸易小组，深入少数民族地区开展物资交流，成绩很好。由于少数民族地区人口分散，市场稀少，土产滞销，日用品缺乏，这些贸易小组在工作中都采取了收购土产和推销日用品相结合的贸易方针，及固定经营和流动赶街相结合的经营方式。在少数民族村庄分布较密，且已有一些初级市场的地方，贸易小组多以固定经营为主，流动赶街为辅。在村庄极稀，半年才有一两次集会交易的地方，贸易小组便担着货物，往来于二、三百里的山地间，到少数民族居住的村庄去进行交易，同时选择适当地点，开展门市购销业务，帮助少数民族逐步建立了一些初级市场。这样，便初步解除了许多民族土特产卖不出和缺盐、缺布的困难。例如，在武定县彝族、苗族、傈僳等少数民族地区活动的四个贸易小组，仅在今年第二季度就收购了三万七千多丈麻布和大批的火硝、茯苓等土产，总值三亿多元，同时供应了棉布四千多件，食盐一万六千多斤及其他日用品等，总值达二亿八千多万元。
    此外，这些贸易小组并委托在少数民族地区进行贸易的汉族商贩代收土产，推销农具，同时又和少数民族订立口头供销协议，少数民族人民把土产集中运交贸易小组或分支公司后，立即由公司或小组付给货款和运费。少数民族需买货物，按公司批发价作价，并可赊账。这样，就克服了国营贸易公司人手不足的困难，并且逐步恢复和开辟了少数民族地区的商业网。如武定县国营贸易支公司，去年冬季少数民族没有一个人上门来做生意；实行上述办法后，今年就经常有少数民族二、三十人，背着土产从一、二百里路外赶来城内进行交易。
    云南省国营贸易公司还吸收了一部分少数民族干部参加贸易工作，这对于少数民族地区贸易工作的开展，起了很大的作用。（新华社）
