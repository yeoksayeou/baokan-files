Supplementary Democratic Reform Further Liberates Productive Forces

    Judging from the experiences of the Qinhuangdao Management Office of the Kailuan Mining Bureau and the Yaohua Glass Factory in carrying out democratic reform movements over the past two months, it is quite necessary to make up for this lesson in factories and mines where democratic reform is not yet thorough.

        Feudal Remnant Elements Hinder Production Development

    Since liberation, the Qinhuangdao Management Office of the Kailuan Mining Bureau and the Yaohua Glass Factory have undergone some reforms to varying degrees. Especially since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the government has arrested and suppressed a group of counter-revolutionary elements hidden in factories and mines, and the righteous spirit of the workers has been greatly enhanced. However, there are still some feudal remnant elements who still rule over some workers and some production units. For example, in Yaohua there are so-called "Ten Patriarchs" and "Thirty-Six Friends," and in the Qinhuangdao Management Office of the Kailuan Mining Bureau and its affiliated factories, there are "Four Overlords," "Five Tigers of the Fan Family," and so on. These elements are either foremen, gang leaders, or direct assistants to the Kuomintang in ruling the workers in the past, and some are themselves Kuomintang secret agents. After liberation, not only did they not repent, but they also spread rumors and sabotage, suppressed workers, and hindered production and other work in every possible way. For example, Yang Changqing (a secret agent), an outside assistant of the Engineering Office of the Qinhuangdao Management Office of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, was once the captain of the Kuomintang army's automobile company and the captain of the "club team." According to incomplete statistics, he had beaten no fewer than 500 workers. After liberation, he privately listened to Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek's broadcasts and "Voice of America," creating rumors and shaking the workers' production enthusiasm. Kong Xiangzhen, the foreman of the Kailuan Coal Mine under the Qinhuangdao Management Office of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, once used deceptive means to instigate a four-hour "strike" after liberation, but blamed the workers. Hu Yuheng, a foreman at Yaohua, conspired to sabotage the machines by pouring all the machine oil on the machines at once. When the machines were dry and needed oil, he said, "Now that we are liberated, everyone should save, and it should eat less oil." Xu Guangtai, a worker at the iron workshop of the Yaohua Glass Factory, once planned to renovate a certain machine, but Liu Bangshan, the foreman of the workshop, said, "If this machine doesn't work, there are other machines, and there is a section chief above, let the section chief change it, we don't care about this." Worker Wang Fulong planned to renovate a cage-shaped mill last year on "July 1" to celebrate the Party's birthday, but foreman Li Yinfan said, "Anyone who is human or not dares to renovate machines! If you can renovate it well, kick me out of the glass factory." Because of his such blows and obstruction, Wang Fulong did not manage to renovate it until this year's "July 1" when Li took leave. All of this shows that these elements have become a serious obstacle to production and various tasks. If these elements are not fundamentally purged, production cannot develop, workers' enthusiasm cannot be brought into play, and enterprises cannot be run well.

        Boldly Mobilize the Masses to Overthrow Feudal Foremen

    Based on this situation and the demands of the workers, the Qinhuangdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to boldly mobilize the masses in factories and mines to make up for this lesson of democratic reform. When the movement first started in the Qinhuangdao Management Office of the Kailuan Mining Bureau and its affiliated factories, it caused some unnecessary concerns among capitalists and capitalist agents. After the persuasion and explanation by the Kailuan Mining Area Committee of the Communist Party of China and the consultation between the trade union committee and the capitalists, the capitalists realized that carrying out the democratic reform movement would be beneficial to future production and management, and therefore expressed their support and endorsement. They also expressed that they would sincerely review their shortcomings and correct their mistakes in this movement.

    After the movement started, it was warmly supported by the broad masses of workers. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the trade union, they actively took action and launched a just struggle against those feudal remnant elements who had long oppressed the workers. The Kailuan workers called this movement the "second emancipation." After the Kailuan Coal Mine workers overthrew the secret agent Yang Changqing, they automatically gathered more than 1,000 people, beating gongs and drums, parading in celebration, and congratulating each other upon meeting. Up to now, more than sixty feudal foremen have been struggled against in the two enterprises. Among them, those who have committed heinous crimes and have blood debts have been arrested and punished by the government according to law, while the rest have been democratically discussed by the workers and given different appropriate punishments according to the severity of their crimes.

        Productive Forces Have Been Further Liberated

    In the workshops or groups of the Qinhuangdao Management Office of the Kailuan Mining Bureau and the Yaohua Glass Factory that have undergone democratic reform, the workers' class consciousness and production enthusiasm have been greatly improved, and a new atmosphere has emerged everywhere. All the groups that have overthrown the feudal foremen have democratically elected administrative group leaders who are supported by the workers, and have re-examined and revised the patriotic production conventions in a serious manner. In the past, no one in the mining shift of the Yaohua Glass Factory was willing to work in hot places; after overthrowing the foreman Zhang He, everyone scrambled to work in hot places. Before struggling against the foreman Zhang Yincheng in the bricklaying department, some individuals thought he had "good skills" and were unwilling to struggle against him. However, the vast majority of workers pledged that they would not only repair the kiln well, but also do better than when Zhang Yincheng was in charge. They further proposed: In order to celebrate the victory of the struggle, they decided to carry out "hot repairs" to extend the life of the kiln. Lu Ceshui, a lathe operator in the iron workshop, improved technology and tools, increasing work efficiency by 83 percent.

    At present, the democratic reform movement of the Qinhuangdao Management Office of the Kailuan Mining Bureau and its affiliated factories and the Yaohua Glass Factory is still continuing. The groups that have overthrown the feudal remnant forces are resolving internal issues among employees, strengthening internal unity, re-examining and revising patriotic production conventions, rectifying trade union organizations, and reforming systems. The groups or workshops that have not yet completed the struggle against the feudal remnant forces are universally and deeply carrying out this struggle. (Yu Shan)

    补行民主改革进一步解放生产力
    从开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处和耀华玻璃厂两个月来开展民主改革运动的经验来看，在民主改革尚不彻底的厂矿中补上这一课是十分必要的。
        封建残余分子阻碍生产发展
    解放以后，开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处和耀华玻璃厂都或多或少进行过一些改革。尤其是镇压反革命以来，政府逮捕和镇压了一批隐藏在厂矿中的反革命分子，工人正气大大伸张。但是还有一些封建残余分子，仍然统治着一部分工人和一些生产单位。例如在耀华有所谓“十家长”、“三十六友”，在开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处及所属各厂有“四霸天”、“樊家五虎”等等。这些分子或是包工头、或是帮会头子、或是过去国民党统治工人的直接帮手，有些本身就是国民党特务。解放以后，他们不但不知改悔，并且造谣破坏，压制工人，处处阻碍生产和其他工作的进行。例如开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处所属工务处外勤助理杨长清（特务把头），当过国民党军少校汽车连长，“棒子队”队长。挨过他毒打的工人，据不完全统计，不下五百多人。解放后，他私自收听台湾蒋匪广播及“美国之音”，制造谣言，动摇工人生产情绪。开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处所属开滦煤厂把头孔祥珍，在解放后曾以欺骗手段煽动工人“罢工”四小时，反把责任推在工人头上。耀华把头胡玉珩阴谋破坏机器，把发下的机器油一下子都浇在机器上。等机器干了需要加油时，他说：“解放了，大家都节约，它也该少吃点油。”耀华玻璃厂铁工场工人徐广泰曾计划改造某一机器，该场把头刘榜山说：“这机器不行还有别的机器，上边又有课长，要改让课长改去，咱们不管这个。”工人王富龙在去年“七一”时，曾打算改造笼形碾，庆祝党的生日，把头李荫藩说：“是人不是人的，也敢改造机器！你如能改造好的话，把我踢出玻璃厂。”由于他这样的打击阻挠，王富龙直到今年“七一”前乘李请假的时候才偷空改造好。所有这些都说明：这些分子已成了生产上和各种工作上的严重障碍。不从根本上肃清这些分子，生产就不能发展，工人积极性就不能发挥，企业就没法搞好。
        放手发动群众斗倒封建把头
    中国共产党秦皇岛市委员会根据这种情况和工人群众的要求，决定在厂矿中放手发动群众，补上民主改革这一课。运动在开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处及其所属部分厂刚开始时，曾引起资本家和资方代理人的一些不必要的疑虑。经过中国共产党开滦矿区委员会的说服解释以及工会委员会和资方的协商，资方认识了开展民主改革运动对今后的生产和经营上都有好处，因而表示赞助和拥护。他们并表示要在这次运动中诚恳检讨缺点，改正错误。
    运动开始后，即得到了广大工人的热烈拥护，他们在共产党和工会的领导下，积极行动起来，向那些长期压在工人头上的封建残余分子展开了正义的斗争。开滦工人称这次运动为“第二次翻身”。开滦煤厂工人斗倒了特务把头杨长清后，自动集合一千多人，敲锣打鼓，游行庆祝，见面互相道贺。到目前为止，两个企业单位已斗争了六十多名封建把头。其中除罪大恶极、有血债的已由政府依法逮捕法办外，其余都由工人民主讨论，根据罪行大小，分别给以不同的应有的处分。
        生产力获得了进一步的解放
    开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处和耀华玻璃厂经过民主改革的车间或小组，工人的阶级觉悟和生产积极性大大提高，到处呈现一片新气象。所有斗掉了封建领工的小组，都民主选举了为工人所拥护的行政组长，并重新认真修订爱国生产公约。耀华玻璃厂采班场过去谁也不愿在热的地方工作；斗倒把头张和后，大家抢着到热的地方去工作。瓦工部在斗争把头张印成前，有个别人认为他“技术好”，不愿斗他。但绝大多数工人提出保证说：不但要把大窑修好，而且要比张印成在时还要好。更提出：为了庆祝斗争胜利，决定进行“热修”，以延长大窑寿命。铁工场车工卢策书，改进技术和工具，提高工作效率百分之八十三。
    目前，开滦矿务局秦皇岛经理处及所属部分厂和耀华玻璃厂的民主改革运动仍在继续开展。已经斗倒了封建残余势力的小组，正在解决职工内部问题，加强内部的团结，重新修订爱国生产公约，整顿工会组织，改革制度。尚未完成反对封建残余势力的斗争的小组或车间，正在普遍深入地开展这个斗争。（于山）
