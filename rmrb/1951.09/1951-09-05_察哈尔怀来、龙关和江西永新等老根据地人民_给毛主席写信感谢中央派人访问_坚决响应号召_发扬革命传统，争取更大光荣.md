    The people in the old revolutionary base areas of Huailai and Longguan in Chahar, and Yongxin in Jiangxi,
    Write letters to Chairman Mao thanking the Central Government for sending people to visit
    Resolutely responding to the call to "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory"
    (1) Respected Chairman Mao:
    I am Wang Guilan, a model woman worker from Huailai County, Chahar Province. My home is in Dongzhuangzi Village, Beishan Mountain, Huailai County. Our village borders Longguan County and was an old revolutionary base area during the Anti-Japanese War. The people in this mountain area contributed greatly during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, supporting the front lines until the revolution achieved national victory. This time, the visiting delegation you sent to the old revolutionary base areas met with us on August 17th. Our two villages sent four representatives to Diaoe Fort in Longguan County to attend the visitation conference. The visiting delegation also divided into groups to visit our village and nearby villages, and held mass meetings. Now, on behalf of all the working people of Dongzhuangzi Village and Yujiazhuang Village, I am writing to thank you. We have received the letter of appreciation from you and the Central People's Government, the gold commemorative medal, and the inscription "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory" written by you personally. Your concern for us makes us feel very honored and greatly encouraged. The visiting delegation asked us on your behalf if we had any opinions. We all said, "With Chairman Mao's leadership, everything is fine for us. We thank Chairman Mao!" Many people in the village talked about the central government sending people to visit this time, and everyone said, "Chairman Mao is busy all day worrying about national affairs, but he still cares about us so much. This really moves us." Therefore, everyone proposed to write a letter back to you and ask about your health. When everyone saw the twelve-character instruction "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory" written by you personally, it was as if they had seen you with their own eyes. Everyone said, "Chairman Mao hopes this of us, and we must do it accordingly, so that we are worthy of Chairman Mao." Therefore, in this letter, we assure you that we will use practical actions to respond to your call and strive to "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory." We are now strengthening the resistance against the US and aiding Korea, completing the plan to donate airplanes and cannons, continuing to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and doing a good job in production for self-salvation. We must, under your leadership, fight to the end to build our new China! Finally, we shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! From Wang Guilan, a model woman worker from Huailai County, Chahar Province.
    (2) Respected Chairman Mao: You are always concerned about the people in our old revolutionary base areas. Recently, you sent a visiting delegation to our area to understand our living conditions and solve everyone's difficulties. The visiting delegation also brought countless letters of appreciation and your personally written instruction "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory." We were all very excited after reading them. This is truly the unparalleled glory of the people in our old revolutionary base areas.
    We must follow your instructions. We must respond to your call with practical actions and repay your concern and visit. Now the people in our village are earnestly implementing the patriotic pact, strengthening preferential treatment work, preparing to donate a large number of airplanes and cannons after the autumn harvest, and carrying out increased production and famine preparedness work.
    In order to increase production, our village has planted many cash crops this year, and these crops are now growing very vigorously. For long-term planning and famine preparedness, in addition to planting all the vacant land, we also advocate thrift and collect wild vegetables. We have the confidence and assurance to successfully complete all these glorious tasks. We wish you good health! All the farmers of Chenjiayao Village, Fifth District, Longguan County, Chahar Province
    (3) Dear Chairman Mao:
    This year's early rice harvest here is abundant. Just as we were harvesting, the visiting delegation from the old revolutionary base areas you sent arrived. Your care and encouragement made us very excited. We must respond to your call and "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition and Strive for Greater Glory."
    You led us in the land reform and distributed land to us. Now we are launching a patriotic production campaign. This spring, the entire village mobilized to carry out water conservancy construction and pest control work. Therefore, our village did not suffer from drought this year, and the harm of insect pests was greatly reduced. After planting the rice seeds this year, it rained for forty-eight days, and many seeds rotted. In order to replant new seeds and rescue the rotten seeds, the entire village worked day and night in the fields, protecting the seedlings of the entire village from serious damage. In terms of cultivation, the entire village generally achieved two plows, five harrows, and two weedings. The amount of fertilizer used by the entire village increased by 36% compared to last year; and a lime kiln was also opened, burning more than 1,000 dan of lime, increasing the source of fertilizer.
    This summer harvest, because rice harvesting mutual aid teams were organized, the early rice was harvested in the field within five days, ensuring timely summer planting. This year's early rice production increased by 26% compared to last year, which is a rare bumper harvest in more than ten years. Our farmers all say: Such a bumper harvest is the result of Chairman Mao leading us to overthrow the feudal forces, dividing the land, and teaching us intensive cultivation. We are very grateful to you and the Communist Party.
    Dear Chairman Mao, in order to repay your concern for us, in order to repay your condolences, we must work harder to produce, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and support our country's industrial construction. Therefore, we assure you: each mu of high-yield paddy field with two rice crops a year must yield 800 jin of rice. Finally, we wish you good health! All the farmers of Zengjia Village, Caifeng Township, Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province

    察哈尔怀来、龙关和江西永新等老根据地人民
    给毛主席写信感谢中央派人访问
    坚决响应号召“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”
    （一）敬爱的毛主席：
    我是察哈尔省怀来县的妇女劳动模范王桂兰。我的家住在怀来县北山上东庄子村。我们这个村子与龙关县打界，是抗日战争时期的老根据地。我们这一条大山上的人民，在抗日战争和解放战争中都出过很大力量，支援前线，一直到革命取得了全国的胜利。这一次您派到老根据地来的访问团，已在八月十七日跟我们见面了。我们两个村推派了四个代表到龙关县雕鹗堡参加了访问大会。访问团又分成小组，到我们村和附近的村作了访问，还召开了群众大会。现在我代表我们东庄子村和于家庄村的全体劳动人民写信向您致谢。您和中央人民政府给我们的慰问信、金质纪念章和您亲笔写的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的题字，我们都已经接到了。您这样关怀我们，使我们感到了很大的光荣，并受到了很大的鼓励。访问团代表您问我们有什么意见，我们都说：“有了毛主席的领导，我们什么都很好，我们感谢毛主席！”村子里很多人一谈起这次中央派人来访问，大家都说：“毛主席成天忙着操心国家大事，还这样关心我们，这真使我们感动。”因此，大家提议要写信回敬您，并问候您的健康。大家见了您亲笔写的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”十二个字的指示，就好像亲眼看见了您一样。大家说：“毛主席是这样希望我们的，我们一定要照着去做，这样才对得起毛主席。”因此在这封信里，我们向您保证，我们一定要用实际行动，响应您的号召，努力做到“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。现在我们正在加强抗美援朝，完成捐献飞机大炮计划，继续镇压反革命，并搞好生产自救。我们一定要在您的领导下为了建设我们的新中国而奋斗到底！最后我们高呼：毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！察哈尔省怀来县妇女劳动模范  王桂兰上（二）敬爱的毛主席：你时时刻刻关怀着我们老根据地人民，最近派了访问团到我们这里来了解我们的生活情形，解决大家的困难。访问团还带来了无数慰问信及您亲手写的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示。我们看了以后，都非常兴奋。这真是我们老根据地人民的无比光荣。
    我们一定要照着您的指示去做。我们要用实际行动响应您的号召，答谢您的关怀和访问。现在我村人民正认真执行爱国公约，加强优抚工作，准备秋收后大量捐献飞机大炮，并进行增产备荒工作。
    为了提高生产，我村今年种了很多经济作物，现在这些作物长得都很茂盛。为了长期打算，作好备荒工作，我们除将空白地完全种上以外，还提倡节约，采集野菜。以上这些光荣任务，我们有信心、有把握保证胜利完成。祝您身体健康！察哈尔省龙关县五区陈家窑村全体农民（三）亲爱的毛主席：
    今年我们这里的早稻是丰收的。正当我们在收获的时候，您派来的老根据地访问团到达了。您给我们的关心和鼓励，使我们非常兴奋。我们一定响应您的号召，一定要做到“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。
    您领导我们进行了土地改革，分得了田地。现在我们正开展爱国丰产运动。今年春天，全村动员起来进行了兴修水利和除虫工作。因此，我们村子里今年没有发生旱灾，虫灾的为害也大为减少。今年种下谷种以后，落了四十八天的雨，谷种烂的很多。为了补种新谷和抢救烂谷，全村男女不分日夜地在田里工作，保护了全村秧苗未遭受严重损失。在耕作上，全村普遍做到了二犁五耙二耘，全村用的肥料比去年增加了百分之三十六；并且还开了一个石灰窑，共烧了一千多担石灰，增加了肥料的来源。
    今年夏收，因为组织了割禾互助组，五天以内就把早稻割上了场，并保证做到了及时夏种。今年早稻比去年增产了百分之二十六，这是十几年来少有的大丰收。我们农民都说：这样的丰收，是毛主席领导我们打倒了封建势力，分得了土地，又教我们精耕细作的结果。我们很感谢您和共产党。
    亲爱的毛主席，为了答谢您对我们的关心，为了答谢您的慰问，我们一定要更加努力生产，支援人民志愿军，支援我们国家的工业建设。因此我们向您保证：全年两道禾的甲等谷田，每亩一定要收谷八百斤。最后我们祝您健康！		江西省永新县才丰乡曾家村  全体农民
