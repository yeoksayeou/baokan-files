Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: A dispatch from TASS, Moscow, September 13th: Pravda's New York correspondent, Litoshenko, wrote an article commenting on the growing peace movement in the United States. He wrote: The number of peace fighters in the United States is increasing daily. Neither the insane police terror, the threat of unemployment, nor the assassinations by thugs can in any way frustrate the will of these people to fight for peace.

　　The American custom is to regard the first Monday in September as Labor Day. On that day, workers demonstrated their will to fight for peace with practical actions. Large-scale mass peace rallies were held in cities such as Detroit, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Tens of thousands of lower-level trade union activists and workers signed peace declarations. The national committee of the "American Peace Crusade" announced that this week was "The Week of Struggle to Achieve a Ceasefire in Korea."

　　These days, in New York and many other cities in the United States, peace fighters have set up brief rallies at intersections, distributing leaflets and collecting signatures for petitions demanding an immediate end to the Korean War. Huge banners are hung on buses, reading: Stop the Korean War! Conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact!

　　Litoshenko recounted: The National Peace Conference held in Chicago ended more than two months ago. The representatives have shown initial results in their work after returning. A female representative from Oregon reported that she had recently delivered speeches at thirty-four rallies, conveying the proceedings of the Chicago Peace Conference. The audience is very concerned about peace. Now, four peace committees have been established in local factories, and more than 10,000 people have signed petitions to Truman demanding an immediate armistice agreement in Korea and the convening of a five-power conference. Another representative from Detroit reported that on the 250th anniversary of the founding of Detroit, peace fighters distributed tens of thousands of pamphlets to the masses, urging them to firmly oppose Wall Street's war policy.

　　Litoshenko pointed out that American peace fighters have no funds, cannot publish articles in newspapers and magazines, and have no opportunities to broadcast on the radio. But they have an indomitable will to uphold peace and are determined to overcome any difficulties in preparing to fight for peace. In places where there are no mimeograph machines or typewriters, activists hand-copy pamphlets so that millions of people can read genuine words of peace and hear the passionate call asking them to join the ranks of the struggle for peace and against war.

　　Litoshenko pointed out that the work of peace fighters has produced practical results. People across the United States are writing letters, postcards, or telegrams to Truman and members of the U.S. Congress, demanding that they take immediate and concrete measures to ensure peace and resolve disputes between major powers peacefully.

    美国和平运动高涨
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：真理报驻纽约记者李托希科著文评论美国日益高涨的和平运动。他写道：美国和平战士的数目日益增加。不论是疯狂的警察恐怖、失业的威胁，还是匪徒的暗害，都丝毫不能挫折这些人民为和平而斗争的意志。
    美国的习惯是把九月份第一个星期一为劳工节，那一天，工人们用实际行动表现了他们争取和平的意志。在底特律、芝加哥、旧金山与洛杉矶等城市，都举行了盛大的群众性的和平集会。成千成万的下层工会积极分子与工人在和平宣言上签了名。“美国和平十字军”全国委员会宣布这一周为“争取朝鲜停火斗争周”。
    这几天，在纽约及美国其他许多城市中，和平战士在十字路口布置了简短的集会，散发小册子，为要求立即结束朝鲜战争的请愿书征集签名。公共汽车上挂着巨大的长旗，上面写着：停止朝鲜战争！缔结五大国和平公约！
    李托希科追述说：在芝加哥举行的全国和平大会已经结束两个多月了。代表们回去后在工作中已经表现出初步成绩。一位妇女代表从俄勒冈州报告说：她近来在三十四个集会上发表了演说，传达了芝加哥和平大会的经过。听众非常关怀和平。现在，在当地工厂中已经成立了四个和平委员会，并且有一万多人在写给杜鲁门要求立即缔结朝鲜停战协定和召开五大国会议的请愿书上签了名。另一个底特律代表的报告说：在底特律建市二百五十周年纪念日那天，和平战士向群众散发了数万本小册子，敦促他们坚决反对华尔街的战争政策。
    李托希科指出：美国的和平战士没有基金，无法在报纸与杂志上发表文章，也没有机会在电台广播。但是他们却有不屈不挠的拥护和平的意志，并且有为争取和平准备克服任何困难的决心。在没有油印机和打字机的地方，积极分子就用手传抄小册子，使千百万人民能够读到真正的和平的言论，能够听到要求他们参加争取和平反对战争的队伍中来的热情号召。
    李托希科指出：和平战士的工作已经产生了实际的效果。美国全国各地的人民正纷纷写信、写明信片或打电报给杜鲁门和美国国会议员，要求立即采取具体措施来保证和平并且以和平方式来解决大国间的纷歧。
