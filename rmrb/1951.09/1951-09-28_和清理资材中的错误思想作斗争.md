    A Brief Commentary on Economic Life

    According to a letter from the Inventory Clearance and Capital Verification Committee of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau: During the recent verification of working capital, the sub-bureau discovered that the total value of materials in stock in June was six times more than the total value of materials that the sub-bureau should have consumed in the same month. In other words, one sub-bureau occupied the material funds of seven similar sub-bureaus. This phenomenon powerfully illustrates that the waste of funds in the management of some enterprises is extremely serious. Although there are many reasons for this phenomenon, the most important one is that many leading cadres of enterprises still have the supply system mentality of "the meat rots in the pot." Some people say, "Whether we clear the inventory or not, it's all the same. We didn't take the materials home!" They use this reason to refuse to clear inventory; under the control of this thinking, they also refuse to implement economic accounting. This reason is obviously wrong. Taking state materials home, that is, embezzling state materials, is a serious illegal act, not allowed by the national law; but is it permissible to sit idly by and watch the state property be wasted for nothing? Apart from the difference in subjective motives, isn't the result of losing people's property the same? Some comrades refuse to clear inventory, and their "starting point" is sometimes not necessarily bad. On the contrary, they often want to do a good job in their own unit. They say, "It's more convenient to have the materials in our factory than to have them in your (superior leadership organs)." Obviously, this is a local viewpoint, which is incompatible with our due overall concept. For the "convenience" of one's own factory, without asking what impact the backlog of materials will have on the country, isn't this regarding one's own factory as an independent kingdom isolated from the country? How can we allow the existence of one or several independent kingdoms within the people's country? When industrial and mining enterprises across the country are clearing inventory and verifying capital, they must fight against these erroneous ideas. Otherwise, no factory can truly be run well, and the entire enterprise cannot move forward.

    和清理资材中的错误思想作斗争
    据西安铁路分局清理资材核定资金委员会来信称：该局最近核定流动资金时，发现该局六月份库存材料总值，竟比该局同月应该消耗的材料总值多出六倍，也就是说，一个分局占用了相当同样的七个分局的材料资金。这种现象有力地说明了某些企业管理的资金浪费现象是极端严重的。产生这种现象的原因虽然很多，但最主要的一个是许多企业领导干部还存在着“肉烂在锅里”的供给制思想。有些人说：“清理资材不清理资材，反正是一样。我们又没有把资材带回家去！”他们拿这种理由拒绝清理资材；也在这种思想支配之下，拒绝实行经济核算。这种理由显然是错误的。把国家资材带回家去，就是说，贪污国家资材，那是严重的犯法的行为，为国法所不许；但是坐视国家财产白白地浪费掉，难道是可以允许的吗？除了主观动机不同外，其损失人民财产的结果，难道不是一样的吗？有些同志拒绝清理资材，他们的“出发点”有时并不一定坏，恰恰相反，他们常常还是为了把本单位的工作搞好的。他们说：“材料放在我们厂里，总比放在你们（上级领导机关）那里方便。”显然地，这是一种局部观点，它与我们应有的整体观念是不相容的。为了自己工厂的“方便”，而不问积压资材对于国家将发生什么样的影响，这不是把自己的工厂看成孤立于国家之外的独立王国了吗？怎么能够允许在人民国家之内，存在一个或几个独立王国呢？在全国各地工矿企业正在清理资材核定资金的时候，必须和这些错误思想作斗争。否则，任何工厂都不能真正办好，而整个企业也不能前进。
