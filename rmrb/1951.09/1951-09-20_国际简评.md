International Short Commentary

Another Test for the West German "Government"

    The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, has proposed holding an all-German conference with representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to discuss holding all-German elections and accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. This proposal embodies the desire of all German people for peaceful reunification and is warmly welcomed by the peace-loving people of the world.
    As everyone remembers, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic proposed to the West German "government" the establishment of an all-German constitutional conference in January of this year, but that proposal was rejected by the West German "government." In recent months, under the direction of its American masters, the West German "government" has been desperately restoring the war potential of the West German economy and preparing to restore the German Wehrmacht and turn West Germany into a base for a new war, driving the West German people towards a terrible war disaster. Now, the Washington meeting of the US, British, and French foreign ministers has decided to blatantly revive German militarism, to conclude a so-called "peace agreement" with the West German "government," and to allow West German troops to join the so-called "European Army." In this way, the West German people will be thrown into the abyss of war and suffering by the American and British imperialist warmongers!
    Grotewohl's proposal is to save the West German people from enslavement by US and British imperialism and to shatter the US imperialist conspiracy to use the West German people as cannon fodder to launch a new war. This proposal will be another serious test for the West German "government": Does the West German "government" hope to achieve peaceful reunification for Germany, thereby saving the German people from the scourge of war? Or will it continue to depend on US imperialism and treat the West German people as American aggression's cannon fodder? It must make a public choice and statement before the German people and the people of the world.

Why is morale low?

    The war waged by the American aggressors in Korea is unpopular. According to Dutch newspaper reports, some of the Dutch soldiers in the small units fighting alongside the American aggressor army in Korea are mentally ill. These mentally ill patients were sent to the Korean battlefield by the Dutch government through deception after its recruitment of "volunteer troops" for the Korean war failed. According to Korean newspaper reports, among the Australian soldiers captured by the Korean People's Army were Italians. These reports show that even in the satellite states of the United States, people with conscience and clear minds are unwilling to die in Korea for the sake of American monopoly capitalists in a criminal war of aggression against the Korean people thousands of kilometers away. A few days ago, more than two thousand young people in Denmark, in a statement protesting the Danish government's dispatch of troops to Korea, said: "We know that all young people want to live to build a better future and are unwilling to die thousands of kilometers away in the American's criminal war of aggression against the Korean people." For this reason, the satellite countries have had to deceive some mentally ill patients or buy off some desperadoes and send them to the Korean battlefield to meet the needs of American aggression. This is why there are mentally ill patients in the Dutch army and Italian soldiers in the Australian army.
    The low morale of this so-called "United Nations Army" pieced together in this way is conceivable.

    国际简评
    对西德“政府”的又一次考验
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥建议举行有德意志民主共和国与西德代表参加的全德会议，讨论举行全德选举和加速缔结对德和约问题。这个建议，体现了全德人民要求和平统一的愿望，也是世界和平人民所热烈欢迎的。
    大家记得，德意志民主共和国人民议会在今年一月，就向西德“政府”提出过建立全德立宪会议的建议，但是那个建议被西德“政府”拒绝了。几个月来，西德“政府”在其美国主子的指使下，拼命恢复西德经济中的战争潜力，并为恢复德国国防军与把西德变成新战争的基地而进行准备工作，驱使西德人民走向可怕的战争灾祸。现在，华盛顿美、英、法三国外长会议又决定要明目张胆地复活德国军国主义，决定与西德“政府”缔结所谓“和平协定”，让西德军队加入所谓“欧洲联军”。这样，西德人民将被美、英帝国主义战争贩子们投入战争与苦难的深渊！
    格罗提渥的建议，就是为了挽救西德人民免于美英帝国主义的奴役，粉碎美帝国主义利用西德人民当炮灰发动新战争的阴谋。这个建议，对于西德“政府”，则将是又一次的严重考验：西德“政府”究竟希望使德国获得和平统一，因而使德国人民免于战争的灾祸呢？还是继续依附美帝国主义，把西德人民当作美国侵略的炮灰呢？在德国人民与世界人民的面前，它必须作一次公开的选择与表示了。
    为什么士气低下？
    美国侵略者在朝鲜所进行的战争，是不得人心的。据荷兰报纸消息，与美国侵略军一起在朝鲜作战的小队荷兰士兵中，有一部分是神经病患者。这些神经病患者，是荷兰政府在招募侵朝“志愿军”遭到失败后，用拐骗的方法送到朝鲜战场上去的。据朝鲜报纸消息，朝鲜人民军俘获的澳大利亚士兵中有意大利人。这些消息可以使人看出：即使在美国的仆从国家里，有良心和头脑清醒的人也都是不愿意为美国垄断资本家到朝鲜去送死的。几天以前，丹麦两千多个青年在抗议丹麦政府派兵到朝鲜去的声明中说：“我们知道一切的青年人都希望为建设美好的将来而生活，不愿意死在数千公里以外美国侵略朝鲜人民的罪恶战争中。”由于这样的原因，各仆从国家只好拐骗一些神经病患者，或者收买一些亡命之徒，送到朝鲜战场上来，以满足美国侵略的需要。这就是为什么荷兰军队里有神经病患者，而澳大利亚军队里出现了意大利籍的士兵。
    这样拼凑起来的所谓“联合国军”，其士气的低下，是可以想见的。
