Regarding celebrating this year's National Day, in addition to singing the national anthem, it is hereby stipulated that "Ode to the Motherland" and "The Hearts of People All Over the World Are One" shall be the basic songs universally sung throughout the country. Both songs are already popular, and are now slightly revised (the lyrics of the first song have a few revisions, and the score of the second song has one revision), and are published below. The Central People's Broadcasting Station and local People's Broadcasting Stations will soon teach these two songs. It is hoped that trade union organizations, workers' night schools, workers' clubs, peasant associations, rural drama troupes, literary and art work groups, music workers' associations, primary and secondary school music teachers, university student associations, troops, government organs, women's organizations, youth organizations, cinemas, cultural centers, reading groups, and other groups will be responsible for promoting and teaching these songs. Local publishing houses and mass publications will be responsible for printing and publishing them, and local cultural and educational organs will be responsible for organizing the above work, so as to ensure that people throughout the country universally learn these two songs and sing them neatly and enthusiastically on National Day.
