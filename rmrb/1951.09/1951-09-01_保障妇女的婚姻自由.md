Safeguarding Women's Freedom of Marriage
Wu Quánhéng

It has been a year since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, and yet many women across the country are still being killed or committing suicide due to marriage problems. According to incomplete statistics, in one area of the Central and Southern Region alone, there were as many as 10,000 women who committed suicide or were killed in the year following the promulgation of the Marriage Law. During the same year, 1,245 women in Shandong Province committed suicide due to forced marriages and domestic abuse (according to statistics from the Shandong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation). In nine counties of the Subei Huaiyin Special District, 119 women were forced to commit suicide or were beaten to death between May and August 1950. This phenomenon should arouse our serious attention, and we must take practical and effective measures to reduce and eliminate it.

The case of the murder of 21-year-old young woman Pan from Yangjia Village, First District, Cangshan County, Linyi Special District, Shandong Province, reported in today's newspaper, is one example of thousands upon thousands of marriage cases.

The tragic killing of Pan tells us that dark and barbaric feudal ideas and institutions concerning marriage and women's issues still hold enormous power in society. According to these feudal ideas and institutions, women have no independent personality; "a wife who is married is livestock that is bought." Wives, especially those who were raised as child brides like Pan, can only be beaten, scolded, forced to do hard labor, and fed pig slop – they are not treated as human beings. If she dares to demand a divorce, that is considered an act of extreme insubordination, and her husband and parents-in-law can kill her at will. This kind of thinking not only persisted in the minds of Pan's in-laws but was also supported by the village cadres. After Pan requested a divorce, the district government summoned Pan's husband, Qi Shoudé, four times, but the village party branch secretary, Chen Yongmao, and the village chief, Liang Fuming, falsely claimed that Qi Shoudé was not at home in order to delay and resist. When Pan was brutally beaten by the Qi family, and neighbors heard the commotion and went to rescue her, the village cadres stopped them, saying, "She deserves to be beaten, who told her to ask for a divorce, you are not allowed to save her." (See People's Daily, August 5, "The Implementation of the Marriage Law in East China in the Past Year"). Guo Yushan, in his capacity as "father-in-law," also said while brutally beating Pan: "You want a divorce, don't you? This time, I'll give you a good taste of it, and see if you still run away!" When they used the most barbaric punishments to execute Pan, and believed they were defending the dignity of feudal morality, the laws of the state simply did not exist in their minds.

It is very clear that the New Democratic state law and these feudal ideas and institutions are absolutely incompatible. To tolerate the rampant nature of these feudal ideas is to allow the destruction of the New Democratic state law, to allow the undermining of the New Democratic state and social system.

The village cadres Guo Yushan, Chen Yongmao, Liang Fuming, and others involved in the murder of Pan were originally politically undesirable elements, class dissidents who had infiltrated the Communist Party. Therefore, they controlled village affairs, protected landlords, oppressed the masses, and at the same time used feudal ideas to carry out the crimes of suppressing and killing women. This shows us that if we do not seriously and thoroughly eliminate the feudal ideas regarding women and marriage, the result will be to create opportunities for all kinds of bad elements to carry out various illegal activities that undermine the country.

Incidents like Pan's were very common in old China. At that time, the state power would never protect Pan but would protect those who abused and murdered her. In those days, countless Pans could only die tragically, silently, and ignominiously. But now, we have a New Democratic state led by the working class party – the Communist Party. The laws of this country protect women and resolutely oppose all remnants of the feudal system. The people's governments, judicial organs, and public security organs at all levels of this country are conscientiously implementing the laws of the state, and there are also organizations of democratic women's federations at all levels to assist government agencies in protecting women's rights. Therefore, in the new China, the murder of any Pan should absolutely not happen. The fact that Pan was subjected to long-term abuse, and even after she requested a divorce she could not avoid being murdered, makes one wonder, where were the Communist Party committee of the district, the people's government organs of the district, and the people's organizations that could and should have handled this incident at an early stage? Why could they ignore such an incident?

The Linyi Branch of the Shandong Provincial People's Court was completely correct in sentencing each offender to the punishment they deserved. However, it should be pointed out that the First District Committee, the First District Government, and the First District Women's Federation of Cangshan County, Linyi Special District, are also directly responsible for this incident. Pan made four requests for divorce to the district and village governments. The district government knew Pan's situation but did not take more active measures to help her and rescue her from the pit of fire. Do they not think that struggling against the dark feudal system and assisting people like Pan who are crying out for help is the inherent duty of the people's government? The district women's federation did not say a word about the abuse Pan suffered on a daily basis. Do they think that the work of the women's federation is only to abstractly discuss the rights and social status of women, and that they should be indifferent to the concrete facts before them? We believe that those who directly killed Pan and those who contributed to Pan's murder should be punished without leniency, and the First District Committee, the First District Government, and the First District Women's Federation of Cangshan County, Linyi Special District, should also make a self-criticism in the newspaper, admit their mistakes, and propose concrete measures to ensure that similar incidents do not continue to occur.

What lessons does the tragic death of Pan in Linyi Special District give to the cadres of our Communist Party committees at all levels, our people's governments at all levels, and our people's organizations at all levels? The lesson is that failure to pay attention to the publicity of the Marriage Law, failure to eliminate the remnants of feudal ideas existing on women's issues and marriage issues, and failure to resolutely and continuously fight against the barbaric attitude towards women's issues and marriage issues will inevitably lead to extremely serious consequences! This serious consequence is the death of thousands or even tens of thousands of innocent women, and the damage to our state and social system!

We believe that as long as we conscientiously carry out the publicity of the Marriage Law and take resolute steps to ensure the implementation of the Marriage Law, the hundreds of marriage cases that cause women's death and injury in various regions can be reduced or avoided.

### 保障妇女的婚姻自由

    保障妇女的婚姻自由
    吴全衡
    中华人民共和国婚姻法颁布已有一年，全国各地仍有不少妇女因婚姻问题而被杀或自杀。根据不完全的统计，中南区一个地区，在婚姻法颁布后一年中妇女自杀和被杀的有一万人之多。同一年间，山东省妇女因婚姻不能自主，受家庭虐待而自杀的有
    一千二百四十五人（据山东省民主妇联的统计）。苏北淮阴专区九个县在一九五○年五月到八月间被迫自杀和被打死的妇女有一一九人。这种现象应该引起我们严重的注意，并且必须采取切实有效的办法来使这种现象减少和消灭。
    今日本报所载山东临沂专区苍山县一区杨家庄二十一岁的青年妇女潘氏被杀死的事件，就是成千成万的婚姻案件中的一个例子。
    潘氏被惨杀的事件告诉我们，在婚姻问题和妇女问题上的黑暗的、野蛮的封建思想和封建制度，仍在社会上有着巨大的势力。按照这种封建的思想和制度，妇女是没有独立人格的，“娶来的媳妇，买来的牲口”，做媳妇的，尤其是像潘氏这样从小当童养媳的，就只能挨打受骂，做苦工，吃猪食，不被当做人看待。如果她竟敢于提出离婚的要求，那就是大逆不道，她的丈夫和公婆就可以任意地把她杀死。这样的想法不仅保存在潘氏婆家人的头脑里，而且还受到该村村干部的支持。当潘氏提出离婚要求后，区政府四次传讯潘氏的丈夫齐守德，村里的党支部书记陈永茂、村长梁富明却谎称齐守德不在家，以拖延抗拒。当潘氏被齐家毒打，邻居闻声去营救时，村干部却阻止说：“该打，谁叫她去要离婚的，不准你们去救她。”（见八月五日人民日报，
    “华东一年来执行婚姻法的情况”）郭玉山在以“公公”的身份毒打潘氏时也说：“你不是要离婚么？这次叫你过过瘾，看你还跑不跑！”当他们用最野蛮的刑罚处死潘氏，并且自以为是在保卫封建道德的尊严的时候，在他们的心目中，国家的法律是根本不存在的。
    很明显的，新民主主义的国家法律和这种封建的思想和制度是绝对不能并存的。容忍这种封建思想的猖狂就是听任新民主主义的国家法律的被破坏，就是听任新民主主义的国家和社会制度的被损害。
    虐杀潘氏的案件中牵涉到的村干部郭玉山、陈永茂、梁富明等人，本来都是政治上的不良分子，都是混入到共产党内来的阶级异己分子，所以他们一面把持村政，包庇地主，欺压群众，一面利用封建思想进行压制妇女、杀害妇女的罪行。这里使我们看出，如果不认真彻底地肃清对待妇女和婚姻问题的封建思想，那么结果就可以给各种坏分子造成机会，以进行其破坏国家的种种非法活动。
    像潘氏这样的事件在旧中国是很平常的。那时的国家政权是绝对不会保护潘氏，而是保护虐杀潘氏的人的。在那个时候，无数的潘氏只能悲惨地、无声无臭地死去。但现在呢，我们已经有了工人阶级的政党——共产党领导的新民主主义国家。这个国家的法律是保护妇女而坚决地反对一切残余的封建制度的。这个国家的各级人民政府、司法机关、公安机关是认真地执行国家的法律的，而且为辅助政府机关保护妇女权利，还有各级民主妇女联合会的组织。因此，在新中国，任何一个潘氏的被杀死，都是绝对不应该发生的。像潘氏这样长期地受虐待，虽然提出了离婚的要求还是免不了被杀害，这种情形就使人怀疑，那些可以和应该及早处理这一事件的该区共产党党委、区的人民政府机关和人民团体究竟到那里去了呢？他们为什么可以漠视这样的事件呢？
    山东省人民法院临沂分院判处每个犯罪者以应得的惩处，这是完全正确的。但是应该指出：临沂专区苍山县一区区委、一区区政府、一区的民主妇联，对这事件也直接负有责任。潘氏四次向区和村政府提出离婚的请求，区政府明知潘氏的处境而不采取更积极的办法来帮助她，把她从火坑中拯救出来，难道他们不认为向黑暗的封建制度斗争，援助像潘氏这样哀哀无告的人是人民政府的天职么？该区的民主妇联对于潘氏平日所受的虐待，没有出来讲过一句话，难道她们认为妇联的工作仅仅是抽象地讨论妇女的权利和社会地位的问题，而对摆在面前的具体事实反倒应该漠不关心的吗？我们认为：直接杀害潘氏以及对潘氏的被杀害起助长作用的人固然应该受到不容宽恕的惩处，而临沂专区苍山县一区区委、一区区政府和区的民主妇联也应该在报纸上作自我检讨，承认错误，并提出具体的办法来保证不再继续发生类似事件。
    临沂专区潘氏惨死的案件给我们各级共产党党委、各级人民政府、各级人民团体的干部们以什么样的教训呢？教训就是：不重视婚姻法的宣传，不肃清存在在妇女问题和婚姻问题上的封建思想残余，并且不去坚决和对待妇女问题与婚姻问题的野蛮态度进行不断的斗争，必将招致万分严重的后果！这个严重的后果就是成千以至成万无辜妇女的死亡，就是我们的国家和社会制度的遭受损害！
    我们相信：只要认真地进行婚姻法的宣传，并且采取坚决的步骤以保障婚姻法的贯彻，那么，各地区造成妇女死伤的千百件婚姻案件，是可以减少或避免的。
