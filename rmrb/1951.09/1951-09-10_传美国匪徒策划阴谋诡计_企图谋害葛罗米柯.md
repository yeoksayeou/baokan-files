Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 9th: TASS, on September 9th, reported that many news agencies reported on September 7th that the San Francisco police had prevented an assassination attempt on Gromyko, the head of the Soviet delegation attending the San Francisco conference. Newspapers reported that to murder Gromyko, the mastermind behind the assassination had planned to stage a car accident. Newspapers said that the American authorities had therefore taken "special measures" to ensure Gromyko's safety, so Gromyko had to travel to San Francisco under the escort of a dozen police cars and motorcycles.
    All these conspiracies and clamoring have caused representatives of other countries to have many doubts about the current public security situation in American cities.

    传美国匪徒策划阴谋诡计
    企图谋害葛罗米柯
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社纽约九日电：九月七日，许多通讯社都报道旧金山警察防止了谋杀苏联出席旧金山会议代表团团长葛罗米柯的事件。报纸报道：为了谋杀葛罗米柯，暗杀主谋者曾策划制造汽车肇祸事件。报纸说：因此，美国当局已采取“特别措施”保障葛罗米柯的安全，于是葛罗米柯不得不在十几辆警车和机器脚踏车护送之下前往旧金山。
    所有这些阴谋诡计和乱喊乱叫，使其他国家的代表都对美国城市目前的治安提出许多怀疑。
