The Paper Industry Management Department of the Central Ministry of Light Industry has summarized the capital construction work of its directly subordinate paper mills in 1951. The capital construction of the factories under the department in 1951 has improved compared with 1950. However, due to deviations in the leadership's thinking, there is still great blindness in the planning and design work of capital construction. In the specific preparatory work, they failed to fully utilize their subjective initiative, resulting in slow project progress, and many shortcomings in the completed projects.

In 1950, the capital construction work of the paper mills directly under the Paper Industry Management Department was very chaotic. The Paper Industry Management Department learned from last year's lessons and began to formulate necessary systems in February. The regulations stipulating monthly preparation of construction funding plans and work reports played a certain role in preventing blind construction and correcting deviations in a timely manner. According to the instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, each factory established a special organization responsible for capital construction. Small factories that could not establish special organizations also clearly defined their responsibilities.

Expanding equipment with great blindness, equipment shifting from old imbalances to new imbalances

In the past six months, the shortcomings in the capital construction of the factories have primarily been the inadequate understanding of the production policy by the leading cadres. They have shown great blindness in improving and adjusting equipment capacity (which accounts for the majority of this year's capital construction). The leading cadres of the factories are very enthusiastic about capital construction. Seeing that the state can invest in capital construction, they want to add more new equipment to their factories to quickly increase production. Under the control of this thought, many factories did not clarify the production policy, nor did they give full play to the original equipment capacity. Based only on temporary needs in production, without careful research, they proposed capital construction projects. For example, the Taiyuan Paper Mill added bleaching washing machines. At that time, the factory only saw that washing and bleaching pulp with bleaching washing machines was more rational and could save electricity, but did not consider that after adding bleaching washing machines, the original pulping machines would have a surplus. The factory had the same situation when adding straw cutting and screening machines. They only thought that some rice straw should be used as raw material, but did not think that rice straw must be processed by a coarse screening machine after cooking. If rice straw is not used regularly and in large quantities, it is not worth adding a coarse screening machine. In the past two years, the factory's capital construction has spent several million jin of millet, but most of the newly added equipment has not been able to fully exert its effectiveness. At the same time, the factory was eager to add new equipment, so it devoted most of its manpower to capital construction, while neglecting the improvement, repair, and maintenance of the old equipment, which led to frequent major accidents recently (naturally, there are also other reasons). This is the biggest shortcoming in the capital construction of the Taiyuan Paper Mill. The Tianjin Paper General Factory added a pyrite roasting furnace. The designer did not consider the potential of the cooking capacity when designing, so they decided to add one furnace. It was not until the roasting furnace was ordered that they found that one furnace was not enough, so they decided to add another one. But two furnaces could not be fully used, and the reaction tower was not enough either. Limited by funding and capacity, these problems can only be resolved in 1952. When the Beijing Paper Mill added a bleaching machine and coarse screening machine, it did not carefully consider the potential of the paper machine's capacity and the possible increase in self-made grass pulp. After adding the bleaching machine and coarse screening machine, it was found that its capacity was not enough, but not much different, and it was difficult to add more. After adding equipment, the factory did not consider future development, resulting in the factory's equipment being scattered, with pulp pipes transporting back and forth, increasing operational difficulties and wasting power. Other factories also had similar problems when expanding equipment. As a result, the equipment capacity of the factories shifted from old imbalances to new imbalances.

Eager to increase equipment, without estimating subjective and objective capabilities, the plans are large and divorced from reality

Blind capital construction is also manifested in not estimating subjective and objective capabilities, but relying solely on subjective wishes, asking the higher authorities to approve more project items and advance the appropriation time. In the initial capital construction plan of the Tianjin Paper General Factory in 1951, more than sixty projects were proposed. This plan was subjective because it did not seriously consider the factory's technical personnel allocation, design and construction capabilities, and the sources of required machinery, equipment, and materials. Later, the leading authorities reduced the factory's plan to more than ten projects. However, after the appropriation of funds for construction began, the factory still felt that there were insufficient design and construction personnel and that its capabilities were insufficient to complete the tasks on time. Compared with the capabilities of technical personnel and the proposed project items, the situation of other factories being divorced from reality was even more serious than that of the Tianjin Paper General Factory. Even after repeated reductions by the higher leading authorities, there were still cases of exceeding subjective capabilities. Some leading cadres of paper mills still regard making plans as a means of getting money. Some factories concealed facts in order to get more money. The Guangdong Paper Mill once concealed the fact that part of the dormitory had been built and that the car had been purchased. Some factories even made construction plans without design, or only had an extremely immature "intention," and asked the higher authorities for instructions, requesting immediate approval and immediate commencement of construction. This eagerness for quick success is bound to take many detours and seriously affect the progress of the project.

Neglecting preparatory work, accumulating funds, and delaying project dates

Although the factories asked for more money and more work, they did not give good play to their initiative, overcome difficulties, and carry out various necessary preparations. The factories have put forward many construction plans. Before the appropriation of funds began, the Paper Industry Management Department also instructed the factories to conduct various investigations and research on design and construction, and the purchase of machinery and materials. However, very few could do a good job of preparation. The Shandong, Tianjin, and Guangdong paper mills have repeatedly urged the allocation of funds. After the appropriation of funds began in April, generally they could not be spent. The Shandong Paper Mill did not disburse funds for more than a month. The dormitory project of the Guangdong Paper Mill was not approved, and it repeatedly stated the urgent need, but two months after the funds were allocated, construction had not started at all, and even the original design drawings had been changed. The factories always thought that there was no way to do preparatory work without money, or they were afraid that the preparations would not be approved. This situation shows that many factories still do not understand the complexity of capital construction work and do not know the importance of investigation and research in capital construction. When encountering difficulties in purchasing machinery and materials, they often wait for the higher authorities to solve them, waiting for unified ordering, and rarely take the initiative to find ways to solve the problem.

Technical personnel have impure ideological styles, and the design is of course not good

In the design work of restoring and expanding old equipment, technical personnel did not understand how to use the practical experience of veteran technicians. Therefore, after many projects were completed, problems were discovered, and they had to be modified again according to the opinions of the workers. There are many examples of factories lacking machine parts, or the part styles being incorrect, or the installation being unsuitable, affecting operation. Some have even been changed repeatedly, but the problem still cannot be completely solved.

The technical personnel of the factories generally want to do a good job, but there are still many problems in their ideological styles. Some people are not serious and responsible for their work, but rely on others; as long as the project is contracted out, they don't care about it. They let the construction company design, neither providing opinions and information in advance, nor carefully reviewing after the design is done. Even within a factory, technical personnel often do their own thing, without researching and helping each other; this leads to mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering not cooperating with each other, affecting the design's lack of practicality. Most technical personnel cannot unite well, and cannot take a serious and responsible attitude to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and study problems. The lack of cooperation between design and construction personnel is also a reason for poor design.

The Paper Industry Management Department has instructed the factories to seriously study the problems raised in the summary, strengthen the ideological education of capital construction workers, re-examine and revise plans, strictly implement various systems, and strive to complete this year's tasks with the greatest effort.

    中央轻工业部直属各纸厂
    忽视主客观力量急于增加设备
    今年基本建设存在很大盲目性
    中央人民政府轻工业部造纸工业管理处总结了该处直属各纸厂一九五一年的基本建设工作。该处所属各厂一九五一年的基本建设较一九五○年已有进步。但由于各厂领导思想尚有偏差，所以基本建设的计划、设计工作中还有很大的盲目性；在具体的准备工作中，又未能充分发挥主观积极性，以致工程进度很慢，已经完成的工程也存在着不少缺点。
    一九五○年，造纸工业管理处直属各厂的基本建设工作是非常混乱的。造纸工业管理处接受了去年的教训，于二月份开始拟定各项必要的制度。其中规定的每月编制施工用款计划及工作报告等制度，对于防止盲目施工和及时纠正偏向，起了一定的作用。各厂根据中央财政经济委员会的指示，建立了负责基本建设的专门机构，小厂不能专设机构的，也明白确定了职责。
    扩充设备时，盲目性很大，设
    备从旧的不平衡转向新的不平衡
    半年来，各厂基本建设中的缺点，首先是领导干部对于生产方针了解得不够明确，在改善与调整设备能力方面（这在今年基本建设中占大多数），表现了很大的盲目性。各厂领导干部对于基本建设的热情是很高的，看到国家可以在基本建设上投资，就想在自己厂里多添一些新设备，以便很快地提高生产。在这种思想支配下，很多厂既没有弄明确生产方针，也没有充分发挥原有的设备能力，只根据生产中暂时的需要，未加精密的研究，就提出基本建设项目。比如，太原造纸厂曾添设了漂料洗料机。当时，该厂只看到用漂料洗料机洗涤和漂白纸浆，比较合理，又能省电，而没有考虑到添设漂料洗料机后，原有的打浆机就有了剩余。该厂在增设切草筛别机时，也有同样情况。只想到应该使用一部分稻草做原料，但没有想到稻草蒸煮后，必须经过粗筛机才能使用。如果不是经常、大量的使用稻草，增设粗筛机是不值得的。两年来该厂的基本建设已经花了几百万斤小米，但是，大部新增加的设备未能充分发挥效用。同时，该厂急于要求增添新设备，于是把大部分人力用在基本建设上，而忽视了旧有设备的改善、修理与保养，以致最近时常发生重大事故（自然也还有其他原因）。这是太原造纸厂基本建设中最大的缺点。天津造纸总厂增设了硫铁矿烙烧炉，设计人在设计时，没有考虑到蒸煮能力可能发挥的情况，就决定增设一个炉子；等到烙烧炉已经定制，才发现一个炉子不够用，于是决定再增加一个；但是两个炉子又用不完；而且反应塔也不够了。限于经费和能力，只能留待一九五二年再来解决这些问题。北京造纸厂增设漂白机粗筛机时，没有仔细考虑造纸机能力的发挥和自制草浆可能增加；在增设漂白机粗筛机后，才发现它的能力不够，但又相差不多，再增设又有困难。该厂增添设备后，没有考虑以后的发展，以致全厂设备零乱，输浆管来回输送，增加操作困难并浪费动力。其他厂在扩充设备时，也都有类似问题发生。这样做的结果，就使各厂的设备能力，从旧的不平衡转向新的不平衡。
    急于增加设备，不估计主客
    观能力，计划庞大脱离实际
    盲目地进行基本建设，还表现在不估计主客观能力，单凭主观愿望，要求上级多批准工程项目，提早拨款时间。天津造纸总厂一九五一年初步基本建设计划中，曾提出六十余项工程，这种计划是主观的，因为并未认真考虑本厂技术人员的配备情形、设计施工能力、所需机器设备和器材来源等问题。后来领导机关把该厂计划减至十余项。但当开始拨款施工后，该厂仍感到设计和施工人员不足，能力不够，不能按时完成任务。其他各厂以技术人员的能力和提出的工程项目做比，其脱离实际的情况，较天津造纸总厂更为严重；虽经上级领导机关一再缩减，仍有超过主观能力的情形。有些造纸厂的领导干部，仍把做计划看成是要钱的手段，有的厂为了多要钱，竟隐瞒事实。广东造纸厂就曾经把部分盖好了的宿舍和已经买妥的汽车隐瞒不报。有的厂甚至没有设计就做施工计划，或者只有一个极不成熟的“意图”，就向上级请示，要求赶快批准，马上开工。这样急于求成，必然多走弯路，严重影响工程的进行。
    忽视准备工作，积压资金，
    延误工程日期
    各厂虽然要求多给钱多办事，但并未很好地发挥积极性，克服困难，进行各种必要的准备。各厂都提出了不少的建设计划，造纸工业管理处在开始拨款前，也曾指示各厂在设计施工、购买机器材料等方面，进行各种调查研究工作；但真能做好准备工作的很少。山东、天津、广东各造纸厂都曾一再催拨费用。四月份开始拨发经费后，一般的都用不出去。山东造纸厂一个多月没有支拨经费。广东造纸厂的宿舍工程没有被批准，一再申述急迫需要，但经费拨下两个月后，根本没有开工，连原设计图样都更改了。各厂总以为没有钱就没有办法做准备工作，或是怕做了准备又批不准。这种情况说明，很多厂还不懂得基本建设工作的复杂性，不知道调查研究在基本建设中的重要性。在购置机器材料遇到困难时，往往是等待上级解决，等待统一订货，而很少主动地想办法解决问题。
    技术人员思想作风不纯，
    设计当然搞不好
    在恢复与扩充旧设备的设计工作中，技术人员不懂得运用老技术工人的实际经验，因此，很多工程完成后发现了毛病，只得再去根据工人的意见进行修改。各厂机器缺少零件或零件样式不对，或按装不合适影响操作的例子很多；有的甚至一再更改，仍不能彻底解决问题。
    各厂的技术人员一般是愿意把工作搞好的，但是思想作风中还存在着很多问题。有些人对工作不是认真负责，而是依赖别人；只要工程包出去，自己就不管了。他们任凭建筑公司设计，事先既不提供意见和资料，设计好以后也不认真审查。就在一个厂中，技术人员也常常各搞各的一套，而不互相研究帮助；这就造成了机械、土木、电气互不配合，影响设计不切实际。技术人员之间大多不能很好地团结，不能以认真负责的态度，取长补短，研究问题。设计与施工人员之间缺乏合作，这也是设计不良的一个原因。
    造纸工业管理处已指示各厂认真学习总结中所提出的问题，加强对基本建设工作人员的思想教育，重新审核修改计划，严格执行各种制度，以最大努力争取完成本年任务。
