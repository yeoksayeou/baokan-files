Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th - On September 10th, our Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army negotiation delegation issued the following statement regarding the issue of the United Nations forces' planned and systematic destruction of the Kaesong neutral zone agreement to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations:

I. Since the Kaesong neutral zone issue arose and an agreement was reached, the facts have proven that in order to allow the armistice negotiations to proceed unimpeded, our side has adopted a completely serious and responsible attitude towards the United Nations forces' proposals regarding such issues. All that could be accepted and was conducive to the negotiations has been, and is prepared to continue to be, reasonably resolved, while unreasonable proposals are resolutely rejected. We absolutely cannot tolerate the United Nations forces' barbaric and unreasonable provocative actions and demand that the United Nations forces adopt the same serious and responsible attitude as our side in dealing with them. Conversely, the United Nations forces have consistently and deliberately planned and are still creating a series of provocative incidents to undermine the Kaesong neutral zone agreement and obstruct the armistice negotiations from the beginning to the present; and after the incidents were exposed, they adopted an extremely barbaric, unreasonable, and irresponsible attitude, denying and disavowing all the provocative incidents they created. As a result, not a single one of the incidents they created could be resolved, thus hindering the resumption of armistice negotiations.

Now, the United Nations Command, immediately after General Ridgway's reply to Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai of our side on September 6th, issued a statement reiterating that Kaesong is not suitable for negotiations and demanding the selection of a new location as the meeting place for armistice negotiations. This demand fully exposes the series of provocative incidents created by the United Nations forces and their barbaric and unreasonable attitude towards these provocative incidents. Its significance lies in making a big fuss over the Kaesong neutral zone issue, attempting to force the Korean-Chinese side's delegation to submit to their constant provocations; otherwise, they will continue to provoke in order to obstruct the armistice negotiations. However, the United Nations forces' continuous provocative incidents undermining the Kaesong neutral zone agreement have approached the brink of a breakdown in negotiations, with the only difference being the large-scale aerial bombardment and ground offensive of the Kaesong neutral zone by the United Nations forces. In order to evade the responsibility for this breakdown in negotiations, the United Nations forces are resorting to new tricks, demanding a change of meeting location. The question is: the United Nations forces not only fail to deal with the series of provocative incidents they created but further demand a change of meeting location. Does this not further prove that their purpose in creating this series of provocative incidents is to destroy the Kaesong meeting location? Since they have not hesitated to adopt all rogue and unscrupulous means to destroy the Kaesong meeting location, which they themselves proposed to neutralize, then when they deem it unfavorable and need to obstruct the negotiations, can they not continue to destroy any so-called new meeting location? Therefore, the crux of the current problem lies in whether the United Nations forces still have the sincerity to allow the armistice negotiations to resume. If they do, they should be responsible for dealing with the series of provocative incidents they created, rather than trying to get away with demanding a change of meeting location. If they no longer have the sincerity to resume negotiations, then demanding a change of meeting location only serves to illustrate that they are creating a pretext for breaking off negotiations.

II. Now, let us review the facts surrounding the Kaesong neutral zone issue over the past two months, and we can fully see the diametrically opposed attitudes of the two sides.

Firstly, on the part of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, when Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai replied to General Ridgway's proposal for armistice negotiations on July 1, 1951, they considered the obvious inappropriateness of conducting negotiations on a hospital ship, hence they proposed Kaesong as the negotiation location, so that the armistice negotiations could proceed smoothly. At that time, the United Nations forces, in view of the enormous influence of the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Mr. Malik's, proposal for a Korean armistice throughout the world, and compelled by the urgent desire for peace of the people of the world, including the American people, had no choice but to agree to Kaesong as the armistice negotiation location; but at the very moment they agreed, their plot to destroy the Kaesong meeting location in order to obstruct the negotiations had already begun in a planned, step-by-step manner.

On July 8th, at the first meeting of liaison officers from both sides, the United Nations forces' liaison officer proposed demarcating Kaesong as a neutral zone as a probe, which our liaison officer rejected as something that could not be resolved by a meeting of liaison officers from both sides.

On July 12th, after two days of negotiations between the negotiating parties of both sides, the United Nations forces stopped the meeting under the pretext that news reporters were unable to come to Kaesong, and on the 13th, they put forward the demand for the neutralization of the Kaesong area. Originally, such a problem could be resolved through agreement, but because the United Nations forces from the beginning attempted to destroy the Kaesong meeting location, they did not hesitate to use trivial issues to arbitrarily halt the negotiations. At that time, in order to allow the negotiations to proceed smoothly, our side agreed on the 14th to establish a neutral zone at the Kaesong meeting location. Therefore, the United Nations forces lost their pretext, and the armistice negotiations were able to resume.

On August 4th, when our military police forces, in order to protect the neutral zone, mistakenly entered the meeting area during their march, the United Nations forces, in accordance with their intention to obstruct the negotiations, still did not adopt normal consultation methods for this matter and announced another adjournment. Our side immediately investigated this incident and guaranteed that such incidents would not happen again, but the United Nations forces still wanted to make things difficult, deliberately delaying the resumption of negotiations until our side gave them another stern reply, after which the United Nations forces resumed the meeting.

III. As stated above, our attitude is so serious and responsible, while the United Nations forces are just the opposite. General Ridgway, in his telegram on July 13th requesting the neutralization of Kaesong, clearly wrote: "I suggest that we both agree not to engage in any hostile actions within this neutral zone throughout our meeting period," but after this agreement was reached, the United Nations forces never complied with it. Their military actions, expressed in the air and on the ground, all prove this point; the facts are as follows:

A. Aerial Hostile Actions

1. From July 14th to August 13th, the United Nations forces' military aircraft frequently intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone, even flying low and circling, creating a threat to the negotiation meeting.

2. Due to these destructive actions by the United Nations forces, our side proposed on August 13th, in accordance with the agreement reached by both sides on July 14th, to stipulate concrete provisions for the issue of any military aircraft not being allowed to intrude into the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone. However, after this specific provision was agreed upon by both sides on August 16th, from August 17th to August 30th, the United Nations forces' aircraft continued to intrude into the neutral zone airspace, carrying out hostile actions such as patrols and reconnaissance, as many as sixteen times, with a total of thirty-one aircraft used.

3. On the evening of August 22nd, a United Nations forces' aircraft intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and carried out a murderous bombing and strafing of our delegation's residence.

4. On the evening of August 29th, a United Nations forces' aircraft intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and dropped flares.

5. At 00:30 on September 1st, a United Nations forces' aircraft intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and dropped two bombs near the residence of our chief delegate, General Nam Il.

6. Within five hours after the United Nations forces' aircraft bombed the neutral zone on September 1st, the United Nations forces' aircraft intruded into the neutral zone eight times. From September 1st to September 8th, the United Nations forces' aircraft intruded into the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone for patrols and reconnaissance, with as many as one hundred and thirty-nine sorties.

7. At 01:35 on September 10th, a United Nations forces' aircraft intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and carried out strafing of the meeting area.

B. Ground Hostile Actions

1. On July 16th, the United Nations forces fired at Panmunjom in the Kaesong neutral zone. On July 17th, General Nam Il raised this matter at the fifth meeting and requested General Joy to pay attention.

2. On August 19th, more than 30 members of the South Korean forces under the United Nations command, wearing military uniforms and carrying weapons, intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and ambushed our military police responsible for police duties in the neutral zone in Songgok-ri, killing platoon leader Yao Qingxiang and wounding soldier Wang Renyuan. In addition to the general physical evidence at the scene, Park Rae-ryang, a security team member from Jangdan County, South Korea, can testify.

3. On August 25th, 21 armed personnel from the United Nations forces, carrying automatic rifles and carbines, intruded into Baektan-ri near Panmunjom in the Kaesong neutral zone, attempting to assassinate our military police personnel. When they were discovered by our side and returned fire, the armed personnel fled to the southeast.

4. On August 30th, more than 10 reconnaissance personnel from the South Korean forces under the United Nations command, wearing military uniforms and carrying rifles, automatic rifles, and carbines, led by Kim Bong-deuk, intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and attacked and kidnapped three of our military police personnel in Tandong-ri, murdering two of them. Kim Bong-deuk was captured by us on September 1st when he intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone again.

All the incidents listed above have sufficient testimonial and physical evidence to prove that these are hostile actions carried out by the United Nations forces' troops within the Kaesong neutral zone in the air and on the ground, proving that the United Nations forces never intended to abide by and arbitrarily destroy the Kaesong neutral zone agreement they themselves proposed. This series of hostile actions in the Kaesong neutral zone cannot be explained unless it is a deliberate provocation to destroy the Kaesong meeting location in order to obstruct the armistice negotiations. Since they have been doing this in a planned and continuous manner, they are afraid of the condemnation of the just people of the world and dare not step forward to admit it, but instead, they insist on denying it and even spitting blood on others, saying that these are all incidents created by our side. We ask: so many United Nations forces' military aircraft continuously intruding into the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone and having two or three bombings and strafing incidents, and so many South Korean troops intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone three or four times and killing our military police, can it be created by our side at will? If all the above-mentioned provocative actions, as the United Nations forces said, were indeed created by our side, why do they not dare to come back to review the provocative incidents on and after August 22nd to verify their lies and demand that we be held responsible? Why did the United Nations forces' liaison officer, when investigating the second aircraft bombing incident in the Kaesong neutral zone on September 1st, witness aircraft intruding into the airspace, and although protested by our side on the spot, did he not dare to directly point out that it was created by our side, but had to resort to rogue methods to laugh it off? Why do the United Nations forces' representatives, liaison officers, and news reporters want to avoid the danger of confronting the residents of the Kaesong neutral zone to verify these provocative incidents and demand a change of meeting location? In fact, the United Nations forces themselves know that no one with a conscience would believe their shameless lies. Moreover, these lies are full of contradictions, and they themselves know that it is difficult to justify them, so sometimes they say that the bomb fragments were blown out of the ground, sometimes they say that they were fired by artillery, and sometimes they say that they were thrown from the sky; sometimes they say that there is no factual basis for the aircraft bombing, and sometimes they say that the Fifth Air Force's radar has proven that aircraft did appear at the time of the two bombings; sometimes they do not admit that the intrusion of aircraft should be restricted by the Kaesong neutral zone agreement, and sometimes they do not admit that the United Nations forces' aircraft have intruded into the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone; sometimes they say that the troops that intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone on the ground are armed organizations of local "citizens of the Republic of Korea," and sometimes they say that it was done by a "mysterious third party." This is truly a guilty conscience and utter embarrassment!

IV. The United Nations forces are precisely in this embarrassing situation of not daring to admit and being unable to deny. At the same time, because their increasingly rampant provocative incidents threaten to make it difficult for them to escape responsibility for breaking off negotiations, they are trying to use the method of shifting the target, proposing to change the meeting location, in order to evade the responsibility of dealing with the series of provocative incidents that have undermined the Kaesong neutral zone, and attempting to push the responsibility for breaking off negotiations onto others. The United Nations forces are spreading rumors, saying that entire divisions of troops and tank units have appeared in the Kaesong neutral zone, as a new supplement to the basis for their demand to change the meeting location, and it can also be the basis for them to break off negotiations when they deem it necessary. But these shameless lies, accompanied by their endless provocative incidents, are being fabricated more and more. Unless they have decided to move towards breaking off negotiations, do they not imagine that all these incidents and lies can withstand actual investigation? An armistice has not yet been reached, and the agenda of the armistice negotiations happens to include the item of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement. If the United Nations forces still have the slightest desire for a ceasefire and truce to achieve peace, can they refuse to thoroughly investigate and be responsible for any incident that violates the agreement? It is conceivable that they refuse to investigate and deal with the acts of sabotage against the Kaesong neutral zone agreement, even if the armistice agreement can be obtained, who can guarantee that it will not be sabotaged, and after it is sabotaged, who can guarantee that it will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with responsibly?

Our side has always strictly abided by the Kaesong neutral zone agreement, and if there are any minor deviations, we will be responsible for dealing with them. However, the United Nations forces arbitrarily destroy the Kaesong neutral zone agreement. Not only do they not take responsibility for investigating and dealing with these provocative actions, but they completely refuse to do so, insist on denying them, but also refuse to review them, and slander our side as the creator of the provocative incidents. What kind of equal and reasonable negotiation is this?! If the United Nations forces want to threaten our side and scare our side in this way, they will never succeed, and they will inevitably suffer the consequences.

We can solemnly inform the responsible persons of the United Nations forces: only if the United Nations forces change their barbaric and unreasonable attitude, abandon their intention to shift the target, and deal with this series of provocative incidents in a serious and responsible manner can the negotiations continue on an equal and normal basis in order to seek a fair and reasonable armistice agreement. Otherwise, the consequences of all delays and obstructions to the negotiations and the breakdown of the negotiations will decisively be borne by the United Nations forces.

    就美方蓄意挑衅阻挠朝鲜停战谈判问题
    我方代表团发表严正声明
    只有美方认真处理挑衅事件谈判才能继续
    否则谈判破裂的后果应由美方负全部责任
    【新华社开城十日电】九月十日我朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军谈判代表团就联合国军有计划有系统地破坏开城区中立化协议以阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的进行问题，发表声明如下：
    一、自开城区中立化问题发生和达成了协议以后，事实证明我方为了使停战谈判得以进行无阻，对于联合国军方面关于这类问题的提议，完全采取认真负责的态度，凡是可以接受而有利于谈判进行的，都曾经并准备继续加以合理解决，无理的则断然予以拒绝，而对于联合国军方面横蛮无理的挑衅行动则绝对不能容忍，并要求联合国军方面采取与我方同样认真负责的态度加以处理。反之，在联合国军方面则是从开始到现在一贯蓄意地有计划地制造了并还在制造着一连串的挑衅事件来破坏开城区中立化协议，以阻挠停战谈判的进行；并在事件被揭露了之后，又采取极其横蛮无理不负责任的态度，对于他们所制造的挑衅事件一律加以否认和抵赖，于是他们所制造的一连串事件，一件也不能解决，因而阻碍了停战谈判的恢复。
    现在，联合国军司令部又于九月六日在李奇微将军给我方金日成最高司令官彭德怀司令员复文之后立即发表声明，来重复说明开城不适于进行谈判而要求选择一个新的地方作为停战谈判的会议地址。这一要求充分揭穿了联合国军方面所制造的一连串的挑衅事件及其对待这些挑衅事件的横蛮无理的态度，其意义就在于利用开城区中立化问题大做其破坏文章，企图压迫朝中方面代表团在他们不断挑衅的面前屈服，否则，他们就继续挑衅，以阻挠停战谈判的进行。但是联合国军破坏开城区中立化协议的不断挑衅事件，已逼近了谈判破裂的边缘，所差的就是联合国军对于开城中立区的大举空炸和地面进攻了。联合国军为要躲避这一破裂谈判的责任，于是他们又耍出新花样，要求更换会议地址。试问：联合国军方面对于他们所制造的破坏开城区中立化协议的一连串的挑衅事件，不仅一概不予处理，反而更进一步地要求更换会议地址，这岂不愈加证明他们制造这一连串的挑衅事件，其目的就在于破坏开城会议地址么？他们既已不惜采取一切流氓无赖的手段，来破坏他们自己提议使之中立化的开城会议地址，那么，任何所谓新的会议地址，当他们认为不利而需要阻挠谈判进行的时候，他们岂不仍可继续进行破坏么？因此，目前问题的中心在于联合国军方面究竟还有无诚意使停战谈判得以恢复。如果还有的话，他们就应该负责处理他们所制造的一连串的挑衅事件，而不是以更换会议地址的要求来转移目标所能了事。如果他们已没有恢复谈判的诚意，则要求更换会议地址，适足以说明他是在制造破裂谈判的藉口而已。
    二、现在我们回顾一下两个月来环绕在开城区中立化问题上的事实经过，可以完全看出双方截然不同的态度。
    首先在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面，一九五一年七月一日金日成最高司令官和彭德怀司令员在回答李奇微将军关于停战谈判的提议时便曾经考虑到在一条伤兵船上进行谈判之明显的不适当处，故提出以开城作为谈判地址，以便停战谈判得以顺利进行。当时，联合国军方面鉴于苏联驻联合国代表马立克先生关于朝鲜停战的建议在全世界范围内所产生的巨大影响，迫于全世界人民包括美国人民在内对于和平的迫切要求，乃不得不同意开城作为停战谈判地址；但就在他们同意的时候，他们破坏开城会议地址以阻挠谈判进行的阴谋已在有计划地
    一步一步地开始了。
    七月八日双方联络官举行第一次会议时，联合国军联络官即提出划开城为中立区作为试探，我方联络官以非双方联络官会议所能解决，当予拒绝。
    七月十二日，在双方谈判方进行两日后，联合国军方面即藉口新闻记者未能来到开城的问题停止开会，并于十三日提出开城区中立化的要求。本来这样的问题是可协议解决的，但是，由于联合国军方面自始就企图破坏开城会议地址，所以他们不惜假借枝节问题，任意使谈判停顿。当时我方为了使谈判得以顺利进行，当于十四日同意在开城会议地址设中立区。因此，联合国军失去了藉口，停战谈判才得恢复。
    八月四日我方军事警察部队为了保护中立区，在行进中误入会场地区，联合国军方面，依照他们阻挠谈判进行的本意，对此事仍不采取正常的协商办法，又一次宣布停会。我方当即调查了这次事件并保证这类事件不再发生，而联合国军方面还要刁难，故意拖延谈判的恢复，直至我方对他们再提出了严正的答覆之后，联合国军方面才又复会。
    三、如上所述，我方的态度是如此认真负责，而联合国军方面则恰恰相反。李奇微将军在他的七月十三日要求开城区中立化的电文中明明写着：“我建议，我们双方同意在我们整个会议期间在这个中立区内不得从事任何敌对行动”，但是，在这个协议成立之后，联合国军方面从来不加以遵守。他们表现在空中和地面上的军事行动，全都证明了这一点；其事实经过如下：
    甲、空中敌对行动
    1、七月十四日至八月十三日联合国军方面军用飞机经常侵入开城中立区，甚至低飞盘旋，造成对谈判会议的威胁。
    2、由于联合国军方面的这些破坏行动，我方乃于八月十三日提议根据七月十四日双方已达成的协议，对任何军用飞机不得侵入开城中立区上空的问题订为具体条文，但是在这个具体条文经双方于八月十六日同意之后，自八月十七日至八月三十日止，联合国军飞机仍继续侵入中立区上空，进行巡逻侦察等敌对行动达十六次，所用飞机共三十一架。
    3、八月二十二日晚联合国军飞机一架侵入开城中立区，向我方代表团住所施行谋杀性的轰炸和扫射。
    4、八月二十九日晚联合国军飞机一架侵入开城中立区，投下照明弹。
    5、九月一日零时三十分联合国军飞机一架侵入开城中立区，又向我方首席代表南日将军住所附近投下炸弹两枚。
    6、九月一日在联合国军飞机轰炸中立区之后的五小时内，联合国军飞机共侵入中立区八次之多。从九月一日至九月八日止，联合国军飞机侵入开城中立区上空进行巡逻侦察等敌对行动，已达一百三十九架次。
    7、九月十日一时三十五分联合国军飞机一架侵入开城中立区，向会场地区施行扫射。
    乙、地面敌对行动
    1、七月十六日联合国军向开城中立区板门店射击，七月十七日南日将军曾在五次会议上提出此事，并要求乔埃将军注意。
    2、八月十九日身着军服、手持武器的联合国军所属南朝鲜部队三十余人侵入开城中立区，在松谷里伏击我担任中立区警察任务的军事警察，打死了排长姚庆祥，打伤了战士王仁元。除现场的一般人证物证外，并有南朝鲜长湍郡的治安队员朴来良可以作证。
    3、八月二十五日联合国军武装部队二十一人携带自动步枪、卡宾枪侵入开城中立区板门店附近的白田里，企图谋杀我方军事警察人员，当被我方发现，予以回击，该批武装人员即向东南方逃走。
    4、八月三十日联合国军所属南朝鲜部队的侦察队员十余人身着军服、携带步枪、自动步枪和卡宾枪，由金凤得带路，侵入开城中立区，在炭洞里袭击和绑走我军事警察人员三人，并谋杀其中二人。现金凤得已于九月一日又侵入开城中立区时为我俘获。
    以上所举的一切事件，均有充分的人证物证，证明这是联合国军所属的部队在开城中立区内从事空中和地面的敌对行动，证明联合国军从来就无意遵守而且恣意破坏他们自己所提议的开城区中立化的协议。他们这一系列的在开城中立区的敌对行动，如果不是蓄意挑衅来破坏开城会议地址以阻挠停战谈判的进行，就无法得到解释，他们既然有计划地无休止地这样做了，但他们却又畏惧世界公正人民的谴责，不敢挺身承认，反而一味抵赖，甚至含血喷人，说这都是我方自己制造出来的事件。试问：这样多的联合国军军用飞机连续不断地侵入开城中立区上空并有了两三次的轰炸和扫射，这样多的南朝鲜部队三四次地侵入开城中立区并杀害了我方军事警察，可以由我方随便制造出来么？如果上述的一切挑衅行动，真如联合国军方面所说，均系出于我方制造，为什么他们不敢再来覆查八月二十二日及其以后的各次挑衅事件以证实他们的谎言而要求我们负责处理呢？为什么联合国军联络官九月一日在开城中立区调查第二次飞机轰炸事件时，目睹空中有飞机侵入，虽经我方当场抗议亦不敢直指为我方制造而只得采取无赖办法以一笑置之呢？为什么联合国军代表们联络官们以及新闻记者们要躲过与开城中立区居民对证这些挑衅事件的危险而要求更换会议地址呢？实际上，联合国军方面自己也知道，他们这种无耻谎言任何有良心的人也不会相信。而且这种谎言，矛盾百出，他们自己也知道难以自圆其说，所以忽而说炸弹碎片是地下炸出的，忽而说是大炮打来的，忽而又说是天上扔下的；忽而说飞机轰炸毫无事实根据，忽而又说第五航空队的雷达已证明两次轰炸的当时，确有飞机出现；忽而不承认飞机入侵应受开城区中立化协议的限制，忽而又不承认联合国军飞机有入侵开城中立区上空的事实；忽而说地面入侵开城中立区的部队是当地的“大韩民国公民”的武装组织，忽而又说什么“神秘的第三者”所为。这真是做贼心虚，狼狈万状！
    四、联合国军方面正是由于处在这种承认不敢、抵赖不得的尴尬境地，同时，又由于他们愈演愈烈的挑衅事件有使他们难于逃脱破裂谈判责任的危险，所以他们就企图用转移目标的办法，提议更换会议地址，以逃避负责处理破坏开城区中立化的一连串的挑衅事件，并企图将破裂谈判的责任推将出来。联合国军方面正在放出谣言，说开城中立区已出现了整师的部队和坦克部队，以作为他们要求更换会议地址的根据的新的补充，并可为他们认为必要时破裂谈判的张本。但他们这种无耻的谎言伴随着他们无休止的挑衅事件越造越多，除非他们已决心走向破裂，否则，难道他们就不设想一下这一切的事件和谎言经得起实际调查么？停战尚未获致协议，而停战谈判议程上又恰恰有监督停战协议实施的项目，如果联合国军方面尚有丝毫停火休战获致和平的愿望，能够拒绝对任何破坏协议的事件进行澈底调查和负责处理么？可以设想，对于开城区中立化协议的破坏行动，尚拒绝调查和处理，即使停战协议能够获得，谁能保证不被破坏，破坏之后，又谁能保证得到澈底调查和负责处理呢？
    我们方面，一向严格遵守开城区中立化协议，少有出入，即将其负责处理，而联合国军方面，却恣意破坏开城区中立化协议，他们不但不负责调查处理这些挑衅行动，反而完全拒绝，一味抵赖，但又拒绝覆查，并诬蔑我方为挑衅事件的制造者。这是什么平等合理的谈判？！如果联合国军方面想以这种方法威胁我方，吓唬我方，那是绝对不能成功的，他们必然要自食其苦果。
    我们可以正告联合国军方面的负责者：只有联合国军方面改变他们这种横蛮无理的态度，放弃他们转移目标的打算，而认真负责地处理这一连串的挑衅事件，谈判才能够在平等正常的基础上继续进行，以求得公平合理的停战协议。否则，一切拖延和阻挠谈判进行并使谈判破裂的后果都决定地应由联合国军负起全部的责任。
