The Great Role of Liberated Peasants in Harnessing the Huai River
By the Rural Affairs Group of this Newspaper

(I)

In the first year of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River, 2.2 million peasants joined the ranks of river management. With the attitude of masters of the country and the unparalleled labor enthusiasm for actively building a new China, they worked selflessly. From last winter to this spring, in about 100 working days, they completed 195 million cubic meters of earthwork for tasks such as embankment restoration, dredging, and ditching. This enormous amount of earthwork, if built into a soil wall one meter high and one meter wide, would be nearly 200,000 kilometers long, encircling the Earth's equator almost five times (the Earth's equator is 40,070 kilometers long). To ensure the supply of materials for this massive project, another 900,000 peasants toiled day and night on transportation lines, using various means of transport to deliver 2 billion jin of materials from as far as Northeast China, Shandong, the Central Plains, and the southern coast to the Huai River construction site.

The great achievements of the first year of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River prove that with the leadership and organization of the Communist Party, the liberated peasants can unleash extremely great power.

(II)

The active participation of millions of peasants on both sides of the Huai River in river management is not accidental. The deep suffering caused by the Huai River had brought them very tragic experiences. Zhou Xuewen, a peasant representative from Wuhe County, northern Anhui, recalled the great flood of 1931: "At that time, only the landlords in our village had boats. Three silver dollars bought a life; those without money couldn't get on board." He personally saw Liu Qiyun from the same village, who didn't have money for a boat, push his crying eight-year-old daughter into the water first, and then the whole family jumped into the water to commit suicide. In the Yellow River flooded area, when the floodwaters came, people and snakes were often driven to the trees, and a cruel struggle unfolded between people and snakes in the trees, with some people even being bitten to death by snakes. After the flood, when people returned to their homes, everything was gone. At this time, landlords and despots exploited the peasants with "one-to-seven" usurious loans (i.e., borrowing one dou of grain and repaying seven dou of grain). The people along the Huai River, living in this disastrous era, urgently demanded river management. However, past experience proved that feudal dynasties, feudal warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionary government had no way to manage the Huai River. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Four Big Families relied on "river management" to plunder the people, and in 1938, they even breached the dikes to release water, exacerbating the Huai River floods. Therefore, the people along the Huai River placed all their hopes for river management on the Communist Party and the People's Government. They were very clear that during the Anti-Japanese War, they had fought against the Japanese invaders under the leadership of the Communist Party and the New Fourth Army. During the Liberation War, they had fought against the Chiang bandit army under the leadership of the People's Liberation Army. After the liberation of the Huai River basin, they had carried out struggles such as suppressing bandits, opposing despots, reducing rent, and providing disaster relief under the leadership of the People's Government. These struggles made them deeply realize that only by following the Communist Party and the People's Government could they find a way to survive. Therefore, as soon as Chairman Mao called for river management, millions of peasants along the Huai River consciously and voluntarily joined the ranks of river management.

(III)

Although millions of peasants along the Huai River participated in river management consciously and voluntarily, peasants are, after all, scattered and undisciplined. Organization and education are necessary to enable them to play a huge role in river management.

The Huai River Management Committee adopted a semi-military organizational method to organize the peasants: a labor corps was organized by county, with the county head as the captain and the secretary of the County Party Committee as the political commissar; a labor battalion was organized by district, with the district head as the captain and the secretary of the District Party Committee as the political commissar; a labor company was organized by township, with the township head as the captain and the secretary of the Township Party Branch or the secretary of the Township Communist Youth League Branch as the instructor; and a labor platoon was organized by village, with the village head as the captain. Below the platoon, a squad was organized with ten to twenty people. In addition, Party and Communist Youth League branches were established in organizations above the company level. Each level of organization elected labor representatives. The establishment of these organizations facilitated the step-by-step and planned leadership of the vast number of laborers.

In the early stages of organizing the laborers, some laborers had confused ideas. Although the laborers urgently demanded river management, they more urgently demanded disaster relief and solving their current livelihood problems. They knew that river management was a form of work-for-relief, and going to the embankment could solve their livelihood problems. As a result, a large number of laborers without labor power (including the elderly, the weak, the sick, the disabled, children, and pregnant women) went to the embankment. At the same time, they did not prepare river management tools, relying on the government to provide them. Some laborers purchased tools themselves, mobilized others to join their squad, and attempted to act as foremen to exploit them. Some township and district cadres believed that laborers without labor power going to the embankment solved their livelihood problems and reduced the trouble of taking care of them in the village, also expressing sympathy. These were all contrary to the principles of "river management focusing on engineering, combined with disaster relief, and tools mainly relying on self-reliance." In order to reverse this wrong thinking, the Huai River Management Committee, through the various levels of organizations of the labor teams, convened various meetings to mobilize the masses to talk about the suffering of disasters and trace the roots of disasters, so that the masses could understand the principles of "river management for ourselves," "doing a good job of engineering is the first priority," and "immediate interests must be subordinated to long-term interests." In this way, the masses automatically carried out "refined labor," and laborers without labor power no longer went to the embankment. At the same time, laborers adopted mutual assistance and other methods to solve the difficulty of river management tools.

While educating the laborers, the Huai River Management Committee conscientiously did two things: first, effectively solve the actual difficulties of the laborers. The biggest difficulty the laborers felt after going to the embankment was the lack of labor power for production in the village, and it was not easy to maintain their families' livelihoods. The Huai River Management Committee instructed the local river management headquarters to send a group of cadres to lead production in the villages: organizing labor mutual aid groups and developing sideline production. At the same time, militias were organized to maintain local security, eliminating the laborers' concerns about the safety of the village. Second, establish a democratic system, and consult with the masses on everything. Cadres and laborers lived together, sharing joys and sorrows; they cared for the laborers' daily life, diet, and illnesses; and they established a reasonable wage system with more pay for more work. These measures stabilized the laborers' working morale.

On the basis of stabilizing the laborers' working morale, the Huai River Headquarters, through the various levels of labor organizations, universally conducted patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea among the laborers. The laborers' political consciousness was greatly improved, and they realized that river management was for the country and for themselves, and the two were completely consistent. In order to work better, the labor teams formulated patriotic covenants. (For example, the covenant of a certain team had these provisions: 1. All laborers unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and take practical actions to manage the Huai River well, produce more grain, and support the front lines to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend the country; 2. Ensure that the project meets standards, and do not go home until the task is completed; 3. Obey leadership, rest on time, unite and love each other, and help each other; 4. Strengthen learning and improve culture; 5. Pay attention to hygiene and protect the body; 6. Abide by mass discipline, return borrowed items, and compensate for damage; 7. Help the government suppress counter-revolutionaries, report bad people, and immediately trace the source of rumors.) In order to ensure the implementation of the patriotic covenant, the laborers automatically formulated work systems, living systems, learning systems, criticism and commendation systems, and regularly convened various meetings to discuss work. In addition, in order to ensure that the project meets standards, labor discipline was specially formulated. For example, in embankment restoration, it was stipulated: 1. "Three no's": no lifting frozen soil, no lifting cement soil, no lifting pure sandy soil. 2. "Four no pounding (with rammers)": no pounding frozen soil, no pounding pure sandy soil, no pounding if the soil pile does not meet standards, and no pounding if the soil is not leveled.

The broad masses of laborers, after organization and education, continuously improved their political consciousness and gradually changed from a scattered and disorganized state to an organized and disciplined team.

(IV)

After the vast numbers of laborers were organized, they became an invincible force; on the thousand-mile-long Huai River management line, with unparalleled labor enthusiasm and wisdom, they overcame all the unimaginable difficulties in the project and created great labor miracles. For example, during the dredging of the Sui River (one of the largest tributaries of the Huai River), there was a section of nearly 40 kilometers of river channel densely covered with hard conglomerates of sand and soil like iron and stone, some as small as eggs and fists, and some as large as cow heads and large stone rollers. According to the requirements of the project, the conglomerates had to be dug out in order to deepen and widen the river channel. However, when construction began, the hard conglomerates damaged tens of thousands of tools. Technicians used drilling rigs to drill into the hard conglomerates, and in some places, they could not even drill down. Faced with this difficulty, tens of thousands of laborers were not pessimistic and disappointed, but united and studied ways to overcome the difficulty. After discussions at the company level, it was first decided to improve the tools: the mattock was changed to a grappling hook. Second, when starting work, instead of directly hitting the conglomerates with tools, a large hole was first dug on the side or below the conglomerate, and then the grappling hook was used to pry it from top to bottom. Using this method, the hard conglomerate slowly fell off. In the process of digging the conglomerate, people's bodies were sometimes injured; however, these laborers with a high degree of political consciousness, even if injured, still insisted on working. A laborer named Han Luqi from Xinwu Township, Sixian County, was working on top of an eight-foot-high conglomerate layer when suddenly the conglomerate layer collapsed, and he fell down with it, injuring his hand. Others advised him to rest, but he said nonchalantly, "It doesn't matter if my hand is injured, my shoulder still works." So he helped others carry soil again. Relying on this courage and wisdom, the laborers finally conquered the hard conglomerate. Their work efficiency continued to improve, starting at 0.2 cubic meters and later increasing to more than 0.8 cubic meters to more than 1 cubic meter. In another section of the Sui River dredging, the laborers created the miracle of overcoming ice and snow. At that time, it was the dead of winter, the river surface was frozen, there was snow on the ice, and it was very difficult to dig the river in the water. However, after patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the labor teams unanimously put forward the battle cry of "The river section is the battlefield, the shovel is the knife and gun, ice and snow are the enemy, and managing the Huai River well is fighting against the U.S. and Chiang," and resolutely fought against ice and snow. They first swept away the snow covering tens of miles of the river surface, then broke the ice on the river surface with sticks, and went into the river to drain water and extract soil. The frozen river water turned people's thighs purple and cracked their hands and feet. However, the vast numbers of laborers were not afraid. In Lingbi County and other places, many laborers had cracks half a finger deep in their hands and feet, but they did not bother to go to the clinic for treatment, and wrapped the wounds with thread or cloth, and silently went into the water to work again. These brave and fearless laborers fought against ice and snow all winter, and finally preliminarily dug a new river channel of more than 30 kilometers (i.e., the newly opened river channel of the Sui River).

In the embankment restoration, the vast numbers of laborers also created great labor miracles. In the Chenwang section of the flood storage area and in the Shangge embankment, the Xiage embankment, and other places, 200,000 laborers universally launched patriotic labor competitions in order to speed up the construction of embankments to block and store floodwaters. After the Funan Brigade put forward the slogan of "Carry More Soil," the labor hero Rong Xize emerged. In a distance of 70 meters, his highest efficiency in carrying soil once reached 18 cubic meters. This amazing figure prompted more than 200 people in his team to increase their soil carrying efficiency from less than 10 cubic meters to 12 cubic meters. At the same time, it promoted the Fuyang Brigade and the Yingshang Brigade to launch a more soil carrying movement. Their slogan was: "Learn from Rong Xize, carry one more load of soil, which is equivalent to hitting one more American wolf!" As a result, the soil carrying efficiency generally increased from 2 or 3 cubic meters to 4 or 5 cubic meters. The soil carriers' soil carrying movement promoted the rammers to launch a ramming competition. The rammers said: "The soil carriers carry a lot, we must practice ramming well, ram well to build a good embankment, and the water will not break the embankment if it overflows." Li Shilong, the leader of the ramming team of the Fuyang Brigade, first led the whole team to practice ramming, and quickly achieved results: ramming high, landing flat, and hitting hard. The embankment after ramming was as solid as iron and stone. Li Yaosan, the leader of his neighboring ramming team, became anxious when he saw this, and mobilized the whole team to practice ramming in the middle of the night. When other brigades learned that the Fuyang Brigade was actively practicing ramming, they joined the ramming craze one after another.

As a result of the patriotic labor competition of 200,000 laborers, the earthwork project of more than 14 million cubic meters in the flood storage area was completed one-third ahead of schedule.

Another aspect of the vast numbers of laborers creating great labor miracles in embankment restoration was to develop wisdom and create new methods for carrying soil, which greatly improved the efficiency of carrying soil. For example, Zou Kunhai, the leader of a labor platoon in Yingshang County, originally used baskets to carry soil, and could only carry 2 or 3 cubic meters a day, which was not efficient. He studied the reason, mainly because the basket was large and heavy, and it was a waste of energy for two people to carry it. Therefore, he invented the method of weaving a dustpan with bamboo to carry soil. The bamboo dustpan was more than half as light as the basket, and it was light and fast to carry back and forth by one person. When encountering long-distance soil transportation, he created a "relay" method (that is, dividing the entire soil transportation distance into several sections, sharing the soil transportation with each other. This can reduce fatigue and improve efficiency). In this way, the average efficiency of each of the 43 people in Zou Kunhai's platoon increased to 5.02 cubic meters, and the highest reached 8.2 cubic meters (the general average efficiency was 3.4 cubic meters), creating a new record for soil carrying along the Huai River management line.

(V)

The millions of laborers in the Huai River management not only demonstrated their enthusiasm and self-sacrificing spirit for national construction, but also actively learned culture and engineering technology for future national construction. In the Huai River construction site, the laborers universally established laborer night schools. Whenever there was rest time, the laborers studied culture despite their fatigue. Some laborers already knew hundreds of words and could compile blackboard newspapers. Because the laborers combined learning culture with practical things, many people learned some engineering technology: they understood what "meter," "kilometer," and "cubic meter" meant; they understood how to look at slopes, measure embankment heights, ram, and combine and change various soil types. Some laborers participated in the construction of the sluice gate project in the flood storage area, and under the guidance of the working class, they had learned how to lay rails, push trolleys, and cooperate with workers in the mixer. In this work process, they began to understand that the advanced production methods of the working class in creating large machines were far superior to the old and backward production methods in the countryside. They believed that the day when the countryside would realize mechanization would inevitably come, and they felt that the engineering technology they were currently learning would prepare the conditions for the realization of mechanization in the countryside.

(VI)

The broad masses of peasants along the Huai River, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government in the past, had defeated powerful enemies at home and abroad and annihilated a large number of enemies in the Huai River basin. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they have once again overcome historical natural disasters and written a glorious page for the water conservancy construction of the new China. This shows that as long as the peasant class is under the leadership of the great working class (through the Communist Party), it will continue to play its great role on the revolutionary road forward.

    解放了的农民在治淮中的伟大作用
    本报农村组
    （一）
    根治淮河第一年，有二百二十万农民加入治淮的行列。他们以国家主人翁的姿态，和积极建设新中国的无比的劳动热情忘我地劳作；自去年冬季到今年春季约一百多个工作日，共完成复堤、疏浚、沟洫等土方工程一亿九千五百万公方。这一巨大的土方数量，如果筑成高、宽各一公尺的土墙，将近二十万公里长，可环绕地球赤道将近五周（地球赤道一周四万零七十公里）。为了保证这一巨大工程的物资供需，另有九十万农民日日夜夜奔走在运输线上，利用各种交通工具，把远自东北、山东、中原及南方海边的物资二十亿斤运到治淮工地。
    根治淮河第一年的伟大业绩证明：有了共产党的领导和组织解放了的农民能够发挥出极其伟大的力量。
   （二）
    淮河两岸数百万农民积极参加治淮不是偶然的。深重的淮患曾经使他们受到非常悲惨的遭遇。皖北五河县农民代表周学文回忆一九三一年的大水灾说：“那时候，俺村只有地主家有船，三块光洋买条命，没钱的就莫上船。”他亲自看见同村的刘起云没有钱上船，把哭喊着的八岁闺女先推下水去，然后一家子跳水自杀。在黄泛区，当大水来时，往往是人和蛇都被赶到树上，人和蛇在树上展开残酷的斗争，有的人竟被蛇咬死。当大水过后，人们回到自己的家园，什么都没有了。这时地主恶霸却用“一比七”的高利贷（即借一斗粮还七斗粮）剥削农民。沿淮人民处在这个灾难的岁月里，非常迫切地要求治淮。但是过去的经验证明：封建王朝、封建军阀和国民党反动政府，都没有办法治淮，蒋介石匪帮四大家族更依靠“治淮”搜刮人民，一九三八年并且掘堤放水，加重了淮河的水灾。因此，淮河沿岸人民把治淮的希望完全寄托于共产党和人民政府。他们非常清楚：当抗日战争期间，他们曾经在共产党和新四军领导下，和日寇作过斗争。当解放战争期间，他们曾经在人民解放军领导下，和蒋匪军作过斗争。淮河流域解放后，他们曾经在人民政府领导下，进行清剿土匪、反恶霸、减租、生产救灾等斗争，这些斗争，使他们深刻地认识：必须跟着共产党和人民政府走才有自己的活路。因此，毛主席一号召治淮，淮河沿岸数百万农民就自觉自愿地加入治淮的行列。
    （三）
    沿淮数百万农民虽然是自觉自愿地参加治淮，但是农民毕竟是散漫的，必须进行组织与教育，才能使他们在治淮中发挥巨大的作用。
    治淮委员会采取半军事的组织办法把农民组织起来：以县为单位组织民工总队，县长为队长，中共县委书记为政治委员；以区为单位组织民工大队，区长做队长，中共区委书记做政治委员；以乡为单位组织民工中队，乡长为队长，中共乡支部书记或青年团乡支部书记为指导员；以村为单位组织民工分队，村长为队长；分队以下，以十余人至二十人组织成班。另外中队以上的组织，建立党和团的支部。各级组织选举民工代表。这些组织的建立，就便利对广大民工进行有步骤有计划的领导。
    组织民工的初期，有些民工的思想是混乱的。民工虽然迫切要求治淮，但是更迫切要求救灾，解决当前的生活问题。他们知道治淮是以工代赈，上堤就能解决生活问题。于是无劳动力的民工（包括老、弱、病、残废，及小孩、孕妇等）大批上堤。同时不准备治河工具，依赖政府发给。有些民工自己购置工具，动员别人参加自己的班，企图当管工从中剥削。有些乡、区干部则认为无劳力的民工上堤，解决了生活问题，可以减少在村中照顾他们的麻烦，也表示同情。这些，都是和“治淮以工程为主，结合救灾，工具主要依靠自力更生”的原则相违背的。治淮委员会为了扭转这种错误思想，通过民工队的各级组织，召开各种会议，发动群众诉灾苦，追灾根，使群众认识“治淮为自己”、“做好工程为第一”、“眼前利益要服从长远利益”的道理。这样，群众便自动进行“精工”，无劳动力的民工不再上堤。同时民工之间采取互助等办法解决治河工具的困难。
    和教育民工同时，治淮委员会认真做好两件事情：第一，切实解决民工的实际困难。民工上堤后感到最大的困难是村中生产缺乏劳动力，家里生活不容易维持。治淮委员会指示各地治淮指挥部派出一批干部领导村里生产：组织劳动互助组和开展副业生产。同时组织民兵维持地方治安，消除民工对村中安全的顾虑。第二，建立民主制度，凡事和群众商量。干部与民工的生活打成一片，共同甘苦；对民工的起居饮食疾病等，加以关心照顾；并定出多劳多得的合理的工资制度。这些措施，使民工的工作情绪稳定下来。
    在民工工作情绪稳定了的基础上，治淮指挥部通过民工各级组织，普遍向民工进行抗美援朝爱国主义教育。民工政治觉悟大大提高，认识了治淮是为国家也是为了自己，两者是完全一致的。为了更好地劳作，各队民工订出爱国公约。（如某队的公约有这些条文：一、全体民工团结起来，在毛主席领导下，以治好淮河、多打粮食、支援前线的实际行动，来抗美援朝保家卫国；二、保证工程合标准，不完成任务不回家；三、服从领导，按时作息，团结友爱，互相帮助；四、加强学习，提高文化；五、注意卫生，爱护身体；六、遵守群众纪律，借物必还，坏了赔偿；七、帮助政府镇压反革命分子，检举坏人，发现谣言，随即追根。）为了保证爱国公约的实行，民工们自动定出工作制度，生活制度，学习制度，批评与表扬制度，并定期召开各种会议，讨论工作。另外为了保证工程合标准，特别定出劳动纪律。如在复堤方面，定出：一，“三不抬”：冻土不抬，水泥土不抬，纯沙土不抬。二，“四不打（打硪）”：冻土不打，纯沙土不打，堆土不合标准不打，土扒不平不打。
    广大民工经过组织和教育，政治觉悟不断提高，逐渐由散漫的无组织的状态变成有组织有纪律的队伍。
    （四）
    广大民工组织起来以后，变成一支所向无敌的队伍；他们在千里治淮线上，以无比的劳动热情与智慧，克服工程中一切难于想像的困难，创造伟大的劳动奇迹。如在濉河（淮河最大支流之一）进行疏浚时，有一段将近四十公里的河道，密布着砂和土结合起来的像铁石般坚硬的砂礓，小的如鸡蛋、拳头，大的如牛头，大石磙。依据工程的要求，必须把砂礓挖掉，才能把河道挖深加宽。但是，开始动工时，坚硬的砂礓就把上万支工具碰坏了。技师用钻探机向硬砂礓钻探，有的地方也钻不下去。面临着这种困难，数万民工不是悲观失望，而是团结一致，研究克服困难的办法。经过以中队为单位的讨论，首先决定改良工具：把洋镐改成抓钩。其次，动工时不先用工具和砂礓硬碰，先在砂礓的侧面或下面掏个大洞，然后用抓钩从上往下撬。使用这个办法，就使坚硬的砂礓慢慢脱落。在挖砂礓的过程中，有时会伤害人们的身体；但是，这些具有高度政治觉悟的民工，即使负伤，仍然坚持劳作。泗县新吴乡有个民工叫韩路奇，他爬在一块八尺高的砂礓层上面工作，忽然砂礓层倒塌，他随着翻下来，手跌伤了。旁人劝他休息，他满不在乎地说：“手伤不要紧，肩膀还管用。”于是他又帮助别人抬土。民工凭着这种勇敢和智慧，最后把坚硬的砂礓征服了。他们的工作效率不断提高，开始时○·二公方，以后增至○·八公方至一公方多。在濉河疏浚的另一段河道里，民工又创造战胜冰雪的奇迹。当时是隆冬天气，河面结冰，冰上有雪，下水挖河是十分困难的。但是各队民工，经过抗美援朝爱国主义教育，一致提出“河段是战场，铁铲是刀枪，冰雪是敌人，治好淮河就是打美蒋”的战斗口号，坚决和冰雪作斗争。他们首先扫除河面数十里地的积雪，然后用棍打破河面的冰，下河排水取土。冰冻的河水，把人们的大腿冻成紫红色，手足冻裂。但是，广大民工并不畏惧。灵璧县等地有不少民工手足冻裂半指深，却顾不得到医疗所治疗，用线或布把伤口包缠起来，又默默地下水工作。这些勇敢无畏的民工，就这样对冰雪战斗了一冬天，终于把一条三十余公里的新河道（即濉河改道新开辟的河道）初步挖成。
    广大民工在复堤当中，也创造了伟大的劳动奇迹。在蓄洪区的陈王工段及上格堤、下格堤等地，有二十万民工为了加紧筑堤拦蓄洪水，普遍展开爱国劳动竞赛。阜南大队提出“多挑土”的口号后，出现劳动英雄戎西则。他在七十公尺的距运里，有一次挑土最高效率达十八公方。这个惊人的数字，推动本队里的二百余人把挑土效率从不足十公方增至十二公方。同时推动阜阳大队与颍上大队也展开多挑土运动。他们的口号是：“向戎西则看齐，多挑一担土，等于多打一只美国狼！”于是挑土效率普遍从二、三公方增至四、五公方。土工的挑土运动推动硪工展开练硪竞赛。硪工们说：“土工挑得多，咱们硪要练得好，练好硪来打好堤，水漫堤不破。”阜阳大队硪工组长李世龙首先领导全组练硪，并且很快练出成绩：扬得高，落得平，打的重。行硪后的堤防，像铁石般的坚固。他的邻组硪工组长李尧三看见着了急，半夜动员全组硪工练硪。旁的大队知道阜阳大队积极练硪，纷纷卷入练硪热潮。
    二十万民工开展爱国劳动竞赛结果，使蓄洪区的一千四百余万公方的土方工程，提前三分之一的时间完成。
    广大民工在复堤当中，创造伟大的劳动奇迹的另一面，是发扬智慧，创造挑土的新办法，使挑土的效率大大提高。如颍上县民工分队长邹坤海，原来是用筐子抬土，一天只能抬二、三公方，效率不高。他研究原因，主要是筐子大而笨重，两个人抬浪费气力。于是，他发明了用竹子编织箕子挑土的办法。竹箕子比筐子轻一倍多，一人一挑，来回轻便迅速。遇到远距离运土，又创造“接力”的办法
    （即把整个运土距离分成若干段，彼此分担运土。这样可以减少疲劳，提高效率）。这样邹坤海分队四十三个人，每人挑土的平均效率提高到五·○二公方，最高达到八·二公方（一般平均效率为三·四公方），创造了治淮沿线挑土的新纪录。
    （五）
    数百万民工在治淮当中，不仅表现对于国家建设的积极性与自我牺牲的精神，同时为了今后的国家建设，积极学习文化与工程技术。在治淮工地，民工普遍设立民工夜校，每当休息时间，民工不顾疲劳学习文化。有些民工已认识百十个字，能编出黑板报。由于民工学习文化与实用的东西相结合，许多人学会一些工程技术：懂得什么叫“公尺”“公里”“公方”；懂得看坡度、量堤高、行硪，及各种土质的结合变化等。有些民工在蓄洪区参加建筑分水闸工程，在工人阶级指导下，已学会铺铁轨、推斗车、和在拌和机配合工人工作等。他们在这个工作过程中，开始明了工人阶级创造大机器的先进的生产方式，比农村旧的落后的生产方式优越得多。他们相信农村实现机器化的日子必然到来，并感到目前学得的工程技术，将为农村实现机器化准备条件。
    （六）
    沿淮广大农民，过去在共产党和人民政府领导下，曾经战胜国内外强大的敌人，把大批敌人消灭在淮河流域。今天在共产党和人民政府领导下，又战胜历史性的自然灾害，为新中国水利建设事业写下辉煌一页。这说明，农民阶级只要在伟大的工人阶级（通过共产党）领导下，在革命前进道路上，将继续发挥他的伟大作用。（附图片）
