　　Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: Nationwide progressive trade union organizations in Japan are protesting the Yoshida reactionary government's violent measures in ordering the arrest of Japanese Communist Party leaders such as Shiino Etsuro. According to TASS on September 15th: According to the Japanese "Metal Workers" newspaper, the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions issued a protest opposing the Japanese government's suppression of the Japanese Communist Party. The protest specifically pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party was being suppressed because it "heroically fought against the conclusion of a separate peace treaty, demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops, and advocated the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty to maintain national sovereignty."
    On September 8th, representatives of Japanese trade unions, including the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union, the All-Japan Transportation Workers' Union, the All-Japan Film and Theater Workers' Union, and the Tokyo Trade Union Council, visited the Chief Cabinet Secretary and the Chief Prosecutor of the Special Examination Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Justice, and lodged protests with them against the suppression of the Japanese Communist Party.
    In addition: On September 12th, Japanese police searched the houses of various democratic organizations in Hokkaido and Iwate prefectures. Approximately 200 such searches have occurred in Hokkaido and 68 in Iwate prefecture.

    抗议吉田反动政府迫害日共
    【新华社十七日讯】日本全国各进步工会组织纷纷抗议吉田反动政府下令逮捕椎野悦郎等日本共产党领袖的狂暴措施。据塔斯社十五日讯：据日本“金属劳动者”报消息，全日本产业别工会会议发表抗议书，反对日本政府镇压日本共产党。该抗议书特别指出：日本共产党之所以受到镇压，是因为它“英勇进行斗争、反对缔结单独和约、要求撤退外国军队、并主张签订全面和约来保持国家主权”。
    九月八日，全日本金属工人工会、全日本交通工人工会、全日本电影戏剧工人工会、东京工会委员会等日本工会的代表，往访内阁官房长官和日本法务府特别审查局检察长，向他们提出抗议，反对镇压日本共产党。
    又讯：九月十二日，日本警察在北海道和岩手县搜查各民主团体的房屋。这种搜查在北海道约已发生两百次，在岩手县已发生六十八次。
