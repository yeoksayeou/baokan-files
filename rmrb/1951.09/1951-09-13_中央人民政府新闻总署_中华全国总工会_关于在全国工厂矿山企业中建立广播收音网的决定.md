    The General Administration of News of the Central People's Government
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Decision on Establishing a Broadcasting Network in Factories and Mines Nationwide

    Radio broadcasting in factories, mines, and other enterprises has proven to be a powerful weapon for ideological education, promoting production, and carrying out cultural and recreational activities. Currently, according to incomplete statistics from only 25 large and medium-sized cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, Lüda, Wuxi, Tangshan, and Anshan, there are approximately one thousand small-scale wired broadcasting stations in factories, mines, and other enterprises; the railway system also has over two hundred wired broadcasting stations (not including train wired broadcasting). In many factories, mines, and other enterprises, tens of thousands of workers listen to the radio every day for learning, and under the influence of broadcasting, they organize various political and production campaigns to achieve the goal of increasing production. Listening to the radio has gradually become an indispensable part of the cultural life of the broad masses of workers. Therefore, trade unions at all levels in factories, mines, and enterprises nationwide should pay attention to radio broadcasting work. Those that have not yet established wired broadcasting stations or listening posts should, in accordance with the "Decision on Establishing a Broadcasting Network" of the General Administration of News of the Central People's Government, establish wired broadcasting stations or listening posts with the help of the administrative side or the capitalists and with the assistance of local People's Broadcasting Stations. Those that have already been established should regularly care for and earnestly lead radio broadcasting work, so that it can play a greater role in workers' production, learning, and cultural life. For this purpose, the following decisions are made:

    1.  For state-owned factories, mines, and enterprises with 300 or more employees that have not yet established wired broadcasting stations, the trade union organization of the unit should immediately cooperate with the administrative side to appoint full-time or part-time personnel based on the specific needs and possible conditions of the unit, and actively prepare to establish radio broadcasting organizations. For those with existing radio equipment (such as loudspeakers, speakers, radios, etc.), efforts should be made to give full play to their role; for those without radio equipment, funds should be prepared in conjunction with the administrative side as needed, and small-scale wired broadcasting stations and other listening equipment should be set up within a time limit. Factories, mines, and enterprises with fewer than 300 people may temporarily set up listening posts and use radios to organize listening.
        Trade union organizations in factories, mines, and enterprises that have established broadcasting stations should strengthen leadership over radio broadcasting work and improve and consolidate the organization of radio broadcasting.

    2.  The employee dormitories of state-owned factories, mines, and enterprises should, based on possible conditions, jointly plan and establish radio listening organizations by the administrative, trade union, and worker family representatives, to organize workers and their families to listen to the radio during their spare time, in order to regularly conduct political and cultural education for workers and their families. If conditions permit, wired broadcasting stations can be established in dormitories.

    3.  The daily work of the radio broadcasting organizations (i.e., wired broadcasting stations, listening posts, and radio operators, etc.) in factories, mines, and enterprises shall be led by the cultural and educational departments of the grass-roots committees of the trade unions in each unit; in terms of broadcasting business, they shall be guided and assisted by the local provincial and municipal People's Broadcasting Stations.

    4.  The main tasks of the radio organizations in factories, mines, and enterprises with wired broadcasting stations are to organize various radio programs, cooperate with the production, learning, cultural and recreational activities of the unit, complete the specific tasks assigned by the administrative authorities, and rebroadcast programs related to employees from the People's Broadcasting Station. The main task of those that have not yet established wired broadcasting stations is to organize listening and dissemination of programs related to employees from the People's Broadcasting Station.

    5.  The radio organizations in factories, mines, and enterprises should report their current status (organizational structure of wired broadcasting stations and listening posts, list of personnel, equipment organization, number of listeners) and work progress, and work summaries to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Broadcasting Administration Bureau, and the local People's Broadcasting Stations on a regular basis. In order to continuously improve the programs of the People's Broadcasting Stations, especially employee programs, the radio organizations in factories, mines, and enterprises should regularly collect and be responsible for reflecting the opinions of employees on various programs of the People's Broadcasting Stations.

    6.  The trade union organizations in factories, mines, and enterprises should list radio broadcasting work as one of the important tasks of the trade union's cultural and educational departments, regularly check and lead this work, and make full use of radio broadcasting work to promote production, organize current affairs learning, carry out political education, and develop cultural and recreational activities.

    7.  Local People's Broadcasting Stations should attach great importance to broadcasting work for the working masses, and should regularly help and guide the radio organizations in factories, mines, and enterprises in business, and listen to the opinions of employees, and improve their broadcasting programs according to their needs and interests.

    8.  Private factories, mines, and enterprises may also establish wired broadcasting stations or listening posts in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions when the trade union and the capitalists agree that it is necessary.

    中央人民政府新闻总署
    中华全国总工会
    关于在全国工厂矿山企业中建立广播收音网的决定
    无线电广播在工厂、矿山和其他企业中已经证明是进行思想教育、推动生产和开展文化娱乐的有力武器之一。目前仅据北京、天津、上海、沈阳、武汉、旅大、无锡、唐山、鞍山等二十五个大中城市的不完全统计，在工厂、矿山和其他企业中即有小型的有线广播台约一千座；铁路系统的有线广播台（不包括列车有线广播）也有二百余座。在许多工厂、矿山和其他企业中，每天有成千成万的职工收听广播，进行学习，并在广播的影响下组织各种政治和生产运动，达到提高生产的目的，收听广播已经逐渐成为广大职工文化生活中不可缺少的一部分。因此，全国各工厂、矿山、企业中的各级工会应该重视广播收音工作。凡是还没有建立有线广播台或收音站的，应按照中央人民政府新闻总署“关于建立广播收音网的决定”，在行政方面或资方的帮助下和当地人民广播电台的协助下，将有线广播台或收音站建立起来；已建立的，应经常关心和认真领导广播收音工作，使之在工人生产、学习及文化生活中发挥更大的作用。为此，特作如下决定：
    一、凡职工人数在三百名以上的公营工厂、矿山、企业尚未设立有线广播台的，该单位的工会组织，应即协同行政方面，根据本单位的具体需要与可能条件，指派专任或兼任人员，积极筹建广播收音组织。凡已有收音设备的（如扩音器，喇叭，收音机等），应使其充分发挥作用；没有收音设备的，应即与行政方面根据需要筹备经费，限期设置小型有线广播台及其他收听设备。人数在三百人以下的工厂、矿山、企业，暂时可设立收音站，利用收音机组织收听。
    已设立广播站的工厂、矿山、企业的工会组织，应加强对广播收音工作的领导，健全和巩固广播收音的组织。
    二、各公营工厂、矿山、企业的职工宿舍，应根据可能条件，由行政、工会和工人家属代表三方面协同筹设收音组织，组织工人及其家属在工余时收听广播，以便对工人及其家属经常进行政治文化教育。如条件允许时，可建立宿舍有线广播台。
    三、各工厂、矿山、企业中的广播收音组织（即有线广播台、收音站及收音员等）的日常工作，由各该单位的工会基层委员会文教部门领导；在广播业务上由当地省、市人民广播电台加以指导和帮助。
    四、各工厂、矿山、企业中的收音组织，如设有有线广播台的，其主要任务是组织各种广播节目，配合本单位的生产、学习、文化娱乐的进行，完成行政当局交付的特定工作，并转播人民广播电台与职工有关的节目。还没有设立有线广播台的，其主要任务是组织收听和传播人民广播电台与职工有关的节目。
    五、各工厂、矿山、企业中的收音组织，应将现状（有线广播台和收音站的组织机构、人员名单、设备组织、收听的人数）及工作进行情况，工作总结，定期报告中华全国总工会、中央广播事业局及当地人民广播电台。为着不断改进各人民广播电台的节目，特别是职工节目，各工厂、矿山、企业中的收音组织，应经常收集和负责反映职工对人民广播电台各种节目的意见。
    六、各工厂、矿山、企业中的工会组织，应将广播收音工作列为工会文教部门重要工作之一，经常检查和领导这一工作，充分利用广播收音工作来推动生产，组织时事学习，进行政治教育和开展文化娱乐活动。
    七、各地人民广播电台应十分重视对工人群众的广播工作，要经常在业务上帮助和指导各工厂、矿山、企业中的收音组织，并听取职工的意见，根据他们的需要与兴趣，来改进自己的广播节目。
    八、各私营工厂、矿山、企业，经工会与资方协商认为有必要时，亦可依照上述各项酌情建立有线广播台或收音站。
