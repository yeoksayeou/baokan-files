　　Defending the Motherland
　　——A Record of the Increase Production and Donation Campaign of Workers at the Hubei Agricultural Implement Factory

　　The workers of the Hubei Agricultural Implement Factory are answering the provocative actions of the American aggressors with the practical action of increasing production and making donations. They are actively improving their skills and tools, and donating their surplus bonuses, fulfilling 140% of their original donation plan for the months of June, July, and August. In September, they plan to increase the production efficiency of three major products—cotton gins, sprayers, and seven-inch plows—by 3% to 25% compared to August.
　　After the Chinese People’s Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea issued the call to donate airplanes and cannons, the workers of this factory decided to, in addition to one voluntary labor day per month, use the surplus bonuses from increased production to make donations. Initially, they felt it was difficult to increase production, because the workers of this factory had already been engaged in labor competitions for two years, and labor intensity had already been maximized.
　　However, in order to donate airplanes and cannons to support the front lines and strengthen national defense, the workers used their wisdom to improve their skills and tools. Labor model Xia Mingwang made rice hulling machine frames. Last October, it took him 63 hours to make one. By March of this year, he could make one in 18 hours. After that, he could no longer improve. During the donation campaign, he repeatedly studied the process and consulted with veteran technicians, and finally found a way to improve the model operation method, reducing the work that required 18 hours to 12 hours. In less than half a month, the factory improved more than 20 kinds of tools and operating methods, increasing work efficiency by one to four times.
　　At the beginning of July, the news of the Korean armistice negotiations reached the factory, and the workers immediately began to discuss it. After discussion, everyone came to this conclusion: American imperialism had no choice but to negotiate because we had beaten them into submission. We can only have peace if we have strength. Based on this conclusion, the workers decided: Continue to work hard to increase production and donate more airplanes and cannons to strengthen the power to strive for peace. The workers saw in the newspapers that eight American aggressor planes had invaded our country’s airspace and seven of them were shot down by our People's Air Force, and they were so excited that they wanted to jump up. The conclusion of the workers' discussion this time was: With airplanes, we don't have to worry about not being able to defeat the American aerial bandits. They automatically raised the plan for increasing production and donations. The American imperialists' repeated attacks on the Kaesong Neutral Zone and their unilateral attempt to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan aroused great indignation among the workers. They said: We must fight well in the factory in September, and guarantee the completion of the plan for increasing production and donations. Labor model Hu Kerong was still in the workshop during the lunch break, studying and improving the tools for creating sprayers, with sweat constantly dripping from his forehead. This tool has been preliminarily improved by him, increasing efficiency by 20%. Labor model Li Liangfu said: “Why are we doing this? To put it simply, let's just talk about this factory. In just over two years, we have personally witnessed our factory grow and change day by day. The shed that used to be supported by a few wooden pillars has now become a factory building with green bricks and red tiles; we used to have only a few dilapidated lathes, but now we have machines filling several workshops; the number of workers has also increased five or six times. Looking at these, and then looking at the houses next door that were destroyed by the Japanese invaders and have not yet been repaired, we must use our own strength to defend the good scenery of the motherland.”

    为了保卫祖国
    ——记湖北农具制造厂工人的增产捐献运动
    新华社记者  乔建元、姚昌淦、马光
    湖北农具制造厂工人以增产捐献的实际行动，来回答美国侵略者的挑衅行为。他们积极提高技术、改进工具，捐献超额奖金，百分之一百四十地完成了六、七、八三个月的原定捐献计划。九月份，他们又计划把三样主要产品——轧花机、喷雾器、七寸犁——的生产效率比八月份提高百分之三到二十五。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会发出捐献飞机大炮的号召后，这个工厂的工人就决定除每月一个义务劳动日外，并用增加生产的超额奖金来捐献。开始，他们对于增加生产曾感到困难。因为这个工厂的工人已经开展了两年劳动竞赛，劳动强度已经发挥的很高。
    但是，为了捐献飞机大炮支援前线，巩固国防，工人们发挥了智慧，又提高了技术，改进了工具。劳动模范夏明望做砻谷机床子，去年十月做一个是六十三小时，到今年三月已经是十八小时就可做一个，以后再也提不高了。在捐献运动中，他又反复钻研，并和老技工商量，终于找出了改进模型操作法的办法，需要十八小时做的工作又减低到十二小时。不到半月，全厂改良工具和操作法二十多种，工作效率提高了一倍至四倍。
    七月初，朝鲜停战谈判的消息传到了这个工厂，全厂工人立时讨论起来。讨论到最后，大家得出这样一个结论：美帝国主义是被我们打得没办法才来谈判的。我们有了力量，才有和平。根据这样一个结论，工人们决定：继续努力增产，捐献出更多的飞机大炮，来加强争取和平的力量。工人们从报上看到美国侵略者八架飞机侵入我国领空被我人民空军打落了七架的消息，他们兴奋得要跳起来。工人们这次讨论的结论是：我们有了飞机，不愁美国空中强盗打不垮。他们自动提高了增产捐献的计划。美帝国主义一再袭击开城中立区，进行片面对日媾和，更激起了工人们的极大愤怒。他们表示：好好在工厂里打赢九月的一仗，保证完成增产捐献计划。劳动模范胡克荣在中午休息时间仍在车间里研究改进创造喷雾器的工具，汗水不断从他的额角上滴下来。这件工具经过他初步改进已提高效率百分之二十。劳动模范李良富说：“我们为什么这样干呢？远的不说，就说这个工厂，两年多的工夫，我们亲眼看见我们的工厂日新月异地成长起来。过去几根木柱撑着的棚子，今天变成了青砖红瓦的厂房；从前只有几部破旧的车床，现在有了摆满好几个车间的机器；工人也增加了五、六倍。看看这些，再看隔壁几家被日寇炸毁还没修好的房屋，我们一定要用自己的力量保卫祖国的好光景。”
