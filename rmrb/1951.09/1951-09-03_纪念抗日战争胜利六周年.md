    Commemorating the Sixth Anniversary of the Victory Against Japanese Aggression
    Li Jishen
    On the eve of this day six years ago, due to the Chinese people’s more than eight years of heroic resistance and the Soviet Union’s declaration of war on Japan, which wiped out the Japanese Kwantung Army and forced Japan to surrender and sign the surrender treaty, the Chinese people won the victory in the war of resistance against Japanese imperialism on this day six years ago.

    The victory six years ago was achieved by the Chinese people after spending more than eight years (starting from the "September 18th Incident" in 1931), sacrificing more than 10 million lives, and losing property worth more than 10 trillion RMB. This was a great and glorious victory finally achieved by the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in the national united front, first contributing their lives, blood, territory, transportation, materials, and economy for the peace and security of all mankind. On the Eastern battlefield six years ago, the Chinese People's Army held back more than two million Japanese invading troops for a long time, creating countless brilliant victories; the Soviet Union also maintained a strong military force on the Far Eastern border, containing one million Japanese elite soldiers, and wiped them out in one fell swoop after the war against Japan in August 1945. In this way, China and the Soviet Union became the main forces in the East against the enemy, and played a decisive role in achieving victory at that time. Without the heroic sacrifices and combat of China and the Soviet Union, the Japanese invading army might have reached the other side of the Pacific Ocean, directly threatening the security of the United States, and it would have been absolutely impossible to achieve the victory to end the war at that time.

    The Japanese fascist militarists' aggressive war to conquer the world was finally brought down by the Chinese people. The Chinese people made the greatest contribution to human freedom and world peace, creating unparalleled historical achievements; at the same time, they broke free from the shackles of imperialism that had lasted for a century and embarked on the road of equality and independence; and further laid the foundation for liberating the Japanese people themselves from fascist persecution. This is the meaning of why we should commemorate the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and celebrate it enthusiastically every year today.

    Six years is not a short time. Especially in the past six years, China's face has undergone new changes. In the past, in the imperialist group that invaded China, Japan was only the most ferocious one. The countries that had been colluding with Japan were Britain, the United States, Germany, France, and Italy. With the collapse of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and the weakening of Britain and France, the United States became the head of the imperialist group, actually following in Japan's footsteps, continuing to collude with and support the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and making themselves enemies of the Chinese people. The Chinese people, still under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in the People's Democratic United Front, eliminated the reactionary troops of the US-Chiang alliance, liberated all Chinese territory except Taiwan, and created a new China two years ago, establishing a people's own regime. They drove out the imperialist forces in China and guaranteed the people's happy and free life. The new face of the new China in the past two years has been built on the foundation of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, today's sixth anniversary commemoration is even more worthy of enthusiastic celebration by the people of the whole country!

    However, amidst this commemoration, US imperialism is expanding its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, inducing Britain to jointly issue the so-called US-British draft peace treaty with Japan, and convening the so-called San Francisco signing meeting. It not only excludes the People's Republic of China from the Allied countries against Japan, but also dares to tear up all the international agreements it once signed, hoping to permanently occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and further plot to seize our Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands; it even completely obliterates the history of China's independent war against Japan before 1941, revealing a hideous face that completely ignores the Chinese people. As for disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union, India, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries, it妄想[deliberately and unrealistically thinks] to turn its actions of occupying Japan, arming Japan, and enslaving the Japanese people for the past six years into "legal" ones, and then reduce Japan to a military base and colony, preparing to drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder for aggressive war; and the so-called "US-Japan Military Agreement", "US-Australia-New Zealand Security Treaty", and "US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty" that it is simultaneously creating, a series of war treaties centered on the United States, attempt to encircle the Asian continent with an arc-shaped military network, threatening the security of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries; all of these are well-known conspiracies and poisonous schemes. This means that six years ago we defeated the wolf of Japanese imperialism, but today we are encountering the wolf of US imperialism; and the US wolf is trying every means to revive the Japanese wolf and make it bite people again. The Chinese people have suffered the pain of being bitten by wolves for a long time, and will never allow the US wolf to be rampant or the Japanese wolf to rise again, destroying peace and endangering the world. In order to maintain the fruits of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and to defend lasting world peace, we must resolutely oppose the illegal treaty unilaterally proposed by the United States and Britain and the illegal conference forcibly convened by the United States. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government recently issued a solemn statement, which represents the views of the entire Chinese people. We would like to solemnly warn the US-British group: a peace treaty with Japan that is not participated in and signed by the People's Republic of China is just a letter of challenge that openly opposes the Asian people. Its content is not the olive branch of peace but the gunpowder of war.

    The Chinese people have always loved peace and safeguarded peace; but they are never afraid of war in order to defend peace. In the past year, the Chinese People's Volunteers in the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, have won brilliant victories in five battles, frustrating the main force of the US aggressor army and stopping the US imperialist ambitions to annex Korea and covet our Northeast. This has initially demonstrated the great power of the Chinese people to defend peace. No matter how the aggressors have used conspiracies in the Korean armistice negotiations in the past two months, the representatives of the Chinese and Korean soldiers have always adhered to the proper way of seeking peace through reasoned struggle and strict preparedness. From this, we can see our confidence and determination to strive for peace and not fear war. The US-made illegal treaty and illegal conference are precisely aimed at expanding the war of aggression against Korea into a war of aggression against China and the Soviet Union, against Asia, and against the world. We must adhere to principles, unite all peace forces of the Asian and world people, stretch out the iron fists of the people, and jointly smash this criminal and shameful war plan of the US-British aggressive group. The People's countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia will loudly call for justice in San Francisco and put forward fair and legitimate treaty proposals; India and Burma in Asia have also formally refused to participate to express their opposition; although Indonesia will attend, it is difficult to guarantee that it will definitely sign; even the Philippines, which has always been a follower of the United States, is still angry and resentful, putting on a displeased appearance. All of these give the US-British group the biggest blow; all of these show the power of the world's people to oppose the US-British group and to defend peace.

    Therefore, our commemoration of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War today must be translated into action. When we say strive for peace, we want to make everyone know the preciousness of peace; when we say we are not afraid of war, we want to strengthen national defense and mobilize the masses. If the aggressors want to expand the war, we want to make the war smaller and even eliminated. Only by maintaining a strong national defense can we make the enemy fear and dare not advance. Therefore, strengthening the implementation of the three major appeals of the General Association for Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea is the best manifestation of commemorating the victory of the Anti-Japanese War today. The movement to donate weapons has already been launched vigorously. Today, we must quickly pay our donations and complete the goal early; and we must continue our efforts to donate again and expand the existing goal. Under the great banner of patriotism and internationalism of Mao Zedong, with the unity of the people and the joint efforts of all, we will surely be able to smash the conspiracy of the US-British aggressors, maintain the fruits of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and thus defend the lasting peace of Asia and the world!

    Eternal glory to the martyrs of the Anti-Japanese War!
    Glory belongs to the heroes of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the Anti-Japanese War!
    Long live Stalin, the organizer of the peace and democracy camp!

    纪念抗日战争胜利六周年
    李济深
    六年前今天的前夕由于中国人民八年以上英勇的抗战和苏联对日宣战一举而消灭日本关东军，迫使日本投降，签字于投降条约，中国人民便在六年前的今天赢得了抵抗日本帝国主义者侵略战争的胜利。
    六年前的胜利，是中国人民耗费了八年以上（应该从一九三一年“九一八”算起）的时间，牺牲了一千万人以上的生命和损失了约合人民币一千万亿以上的财产获来的。这是中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导的民族统一战线之下，为全世界人类和平安全，首先贡献出生命血汗、领域交通、物资经济而终于得到的伟大光荣的胜利。在六年前的东方战场上，中国人民军队长期拖住了二百万以上的日本侵略军，造成无数次的辉煌战绩；苏联也始终在远东边境保持雄厚军力牵制了一百万日本精兵，并于一九四五年八月对日作战后一举将其消灭。这样，中苏两国就成了东方对敌作战的主力，也在当时获取胜利中起了决定性的作用。没有中苏两国英勇的牺牲与作战，日本侵略军也许打到太平洋对岸直接威胁美国的安全，而要在当时得到结束战争的胜利是绝对不可能的。
    日本法西斯军国主义妄想征服世界的侵略战争终于被中国人民拖倒了。中国人民为人类自由、世界和平作了最大最多的贡献，造下光荣无比的史迹；同时也挣脱百年来帝国主义的镣梏，走上平等、自主的道路；更进一步奠定了解放日本人民自身所受法西斯迫害的基础。这就是年年今日我们应当纪念抗战胜利，应当热烈庆祝的意义。
    六年时光，不算很短。尤其六年来中国面貌更起了新的变化。在昔侵略中国的帝国主义集团，日本不过其中凶恶的一个。一向与日本狼狈为奸的还有美英德法意等国。日德意倒了，英法弱了，美国便成了帝国主义集团的头目，竟自追踪日本，继续勾结支持蒋介石反动派，与中国人民为敌。中国人民仍在中国共产党和毛主席领导的人民民主统一战线之下，消灭了美蒋配合的反动军队，解放了仅除台湾外的全部中国领土，于两年前创造了新中国，建立了人民自己的政权。驱逐了在华帝国主义的势力，保障了人民幸福自由的生活。这样两年来的新中国新面貌是在抗日战争胜利基础上建立起来的。所以今天六周年的纪念，更是值得举国人民热烈庆祝的纪念！
    然而当此纪念声中，美帝国主义正扩大一向敌视中国人民的政策，诱胁英国，共同发表所谓美英对日和约草案，召集所谓旧金山签字画押会议，不但排除中华人民共和国于对日盟国之外，且敢撕毁自己曾经签字的一切国际协定，希图永久霸占台湾和澎湖群岛，进而谋我西沙群岛南威岛；甚至一笔抹煞了一九四一年以前中国单独对日作战的历史，露出完全无视中国人民的狰狞面目。至于不顾苏联、印度、缅甸、印尼等国的反对，妄想把六年来占领日本，武装日本，奴役日本人民的行动变为“合法”，进而沦日本为军事基地与殖民地，准备驱使日本人民充当侵略战争的炮灰；更由同时进行制造的所谓“美日军事协定”“美澳新三边安全条约”“美菲联防条约”，一连串以美国为中心的战争条约，企图以弧形军事网包围亚洲大陆，威胁中苏及其他各国的安全；更都为人所共知的阴谋和毒计。这就是说六年前我们打倒了日本帝国主义的狼，今天却遭遇着美帝国主义的狼；而且美狼正千方百计使日狼复苏，重行咬人。中国人民曾经过长期狼咬的痛苦，决不容美狼猖獗，日狼再起，破坏和平，危害世界。为着保持抗日战争胜利的果实，为着保卫世界持久的和平，我们就必须坚决反对美英片面提出的非法和约和美国强制召开的非法和会。中央人民政府周恩来外长最近发表严正的声明，正代表了全中国人民的意见。我们愿正告美英集团：没有中华人民共和国参加并签订的对日和约只是一张公开敌视亚洲人民的挑战书。它的内容不是和平的橄榄而是战争的火药。
    中国人民从来爱好和平，维护和平；但也绝不害怕为着保卫和平而战争。一年来抗美援朝的中国人民志愿军，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战获得五次战役的辉煌胜利挫折了美国侵略军的主力，制止了美帝国主义吞并朝鲜窥我东北的野心。这已初步显示出中国人民保卫和平的巨大力量。无论侵略者近两月来怎样在朝鲜停战谈判上大施阴谋，中朝战士的代表始终持据理力争严阵以待的正当途径谋取和平的实现。由此可见我们争取和平、不怕战争的信心与毅力。美制非法和约和非法和会正是要将侵略朝鲜的战争扩大为侵略中苏、侵略亚洲、侵略世界的战争。我们必须坚持原则，团结亚洲和世界人民的一切和平力量，伸出人民的铁拳，共同粉碎美英侵略集团的这个罪恶可耻的战争计划。苏联、波兰、捷克等人民国家将在旧金山大声疾呼申张正义，提出公正合法的和约建议；亚洲的印度缅甸也为表示反对，正式拒绝参加；印尼虽将出席，但难保一定签字；即如素为美国仆从的菲律宾也还愤恨不平，悻然作态。凡此都予美英集团最大的打击；凡此都显示出世界人民反对美英集团足以保卫和平的力量。
    所以我们今天纪念抗战的胜利，必须见诸行动。我们说争取和平，我们要使人人知道和平的珍贵；我们说不怕战争，我们要加强国防，动员群众。侵略者想将战争扩大，我们要使战争缩小以至消灭。唯有保持强大的国防才能使敌人有所畏惧不敢前进，所以加强执行抗美援朝总会的三大号召，才是今天纪念抗战胜利的最好表现。捐献武器的运动早就轰轰烈烈地展开。我们今天要从速缴纳捐款，早期完成目标；更要再接再厉捐了再捐，扩大已有目标。我们在伟大爱国主义和国际主义的毛泽东旗帜下，万众一心，万拳齐举，必能粉碎美英侵略者的阴谋，保持抗日战争胜利以来的果实，从而保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平！
    抗日战争的先烈们永垂不朽！
    光荣属于抗日战争胜利的英雄！
    抗日战争的领导者毛主席万岁！
    和平民主阵营的组织者斯大林万岁！
