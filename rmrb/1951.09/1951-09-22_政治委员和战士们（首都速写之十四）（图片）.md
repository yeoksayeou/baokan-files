Political Commissar and Soldiers (Sketches of the Capital, No. 14)
    By Shao Yu
    (Seen in Beihai last May)
    Last May,
    The soldiers were digging Beihai.
    "Tired, comrades!" people asked kindly.
    "No! We're used to digging trenches!" the soldiers replied warmly.
    Before long, we became acquainted with each other;
    We also got to know their political commissar.
    The political commissar and the soldiers were carrying earth,
    The May sun reddened the scar on his forehead.
    This year, Beihai is so clean and beautiful.
    Political commissar and his soldiers!
    Have returned to their glorious posts.
    We can read under the trees,
    We can row boats in the lake...
    We have no worries,
    Because the soldiers are guarding and fighting at the front!
    People who love peace and love happiness!
    First of all, love the protectors of our peace and happiness!
    Let us
    Do more of what should be done!
    Learn what should be learned even better!

    政治委员和战士们（首都速写之十四）
    邵宇作
    （去年五月北海所见）
    去年五月，
    战士们正在挖北海。
    “累了吧，同志们！”人们亲切地问。
    “不！挖战壕挖惯啦！”战士们也亲切地答。
    没多久，我们就互相熟识了；
    也认识了他们的政治委员。
    政治委员和战士们正在抬土，
    五月的太阳晒红了他额角上的伤疤。
    今年，北海是那么清洁美丽了。
    政治委员和他的战士啊！
    又到他们光荣的岗位上去了。
    我们可以在树荫下看书，
    我们可以在海里划船……
    我们没有什么顾虑，
    因为战士们守卫和战斗在最前面！
    爱和平、爱幸福的人们！
    首先要爱我们和平幸福的保卫者！
    让我们
    把应做的做得更多！
    应学的学得更好吧！
