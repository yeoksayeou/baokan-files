　　　　　Fifth Paragraph Word Order
　　The structure of a sentence is basically a matter of arranging the order of its various components. The scope of this section is naturally not so broad, limited to the part not covered in the previous sections, mainly the position of the adjuncts. Putting these words in the wrong place generally does not fundamentally change the meaning of the sentence, but it is not in line with the habit, and it is mostly not in line with logic.
　　Noun adjuncts. According to Chinese custom, noun adjuncts can usually only be placed at the beginning (exceptions have been seen in the fourth paragraph), unlike general European languages that can be placed before and after separately. Therefore, when there is more than one adjunct, the order problem occurs. This problem is not simple, but here we can only say a little about it very simply. The general order is: (1) The closest to the adjunct is the noun that does not express possessive relationship, (2) followed by adjectives, (3) verbs and phrases dominated by verbs, (4) numerals and demonstrative pronouns ("this," "that," "each," "various," "other," etc.), (5) nouns and pronouns expressing possessive relationships and expressing time and place, (6) the sentence form is the farthest from the adjunct. For example, "one of our outstanding mathematics teachers with many years of teaching experience," "the average yield of wheat in North China last year that I know." An important exception is the position of (4). (4) is sometimes after (3), even after (2). This order usually indicates that (3) or (2) has a selective effect, such as "the most outstanding color film" and "an outstanding color film," "the (those) three articles that have been published" and "(those) three published articles." But it does not necessarily have this meaning, such as "sparsely arranged two rows of trees."
　　The order of the adjuncts in the following sentences does not conform to general usage:
　　(1) Many nearby women, old people, and children ran to see them. (Periodical)
　　(2) On this basis, various cooperative work exchange groups can be organized. (Periodical)
　　(3) We can participate in the air force, navy, tanks, artillery, communications, public security, military medicine, and various other national defense constructions, just like male students. (Periodical)
　　(4) The top of his head was bald, with only a few countable hairs floating behind. (Manuscript)
　　(5) The only reason for rejecting them was Warner's stripping, destruction, and theft. (Periodical)
　　(6) In the construction cause of New China, they are exerting their infinite and hidden strength. (Periodical)
　　(7) Otherwise, they will not be able to delay the domestic economic crisis caused by the lack of market. (Periodical)
　　It should be (1) "many nearby women," (2) "various cooperative work exchange groups," (3) "various other national defense constructions," (4) "a few countable hairs," (5) "the only reason for rejecting them," (6) "the hidden infinite strength," (7) "the domestic economic crisis caused by the lack of market." The following five sentences also do not conform to the above principles, and at the same time produce ambiguity:
　　(8) The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the support of tens of millions of people in the liberated areas, thoroughly smashed the enemy's offensive on the battlefields of Northeast China, North China, East China, and Northwest China. (Newspaper)
　　(9) Inside are displayed all kinds of things and documents used by Lenin in the past. (Periodical)
　　(10) They said that German can express extremely abstract ideas that other languages cannot express. (Periodical)
　　(11) If female workers do their job well, they can solve some of the unique and personal problems of female workers. (Periodical)
　　(12) A drop of blood was taken from the earlobe of the wounded soldier and placed in a drop of one percent sodium citrate saline solution on a glass slide. (Book)
　　In order to avoid reading it as "tens of millions of liberated areas," "all kinds of Lenin" (which is probably unlikely), "extremely abstract other languages," "some female workers" (which is very possible), "one percent of a drop" (which is not easy to say and does not conform to the facts), these five sentences should be changed to (8) "tens of millions of people in the liberated areas," (9) "all kinds of things used by Lenin in the past" ("using... documents" is not smooth), (10) "extremely abstract ideas that other languages cannot express," (11) "some unique and personal problems of female workers," (12) "a drop of one percent sodium citrate saline solution" (one part sodium citrate is contained in one hundred parts of saline solution).
　　Two ways to express quantity. "Half a sheet of paper" and "half of the paper" each have their suitable uses. The following two sentences are both used inappropriately and should be reversed:
　　(13) The majority of the workers came from the film circles in the reactionary ruling areas. (Periodical)
　　(14) Currently, about two-thirds of the world's tungsten ore production is in the hands of countries in the democratic camp. (Periodical)
　　(13) There is no need to use "the majority of the workers," it is much more refreshing to change it to "the majority of workers." (14) In order to avoid the ambiguity of "two-thirds of the world," it should be changed to "about two-thirds of the world's tungsten ore production," and the word "various" should also be placed before the word "countries" (remove "camp").
　　Verb adjuncts. The general order is: (1) adjectives expressing state are close to the verb, (2) followed by words or phrases expressing location or direction, (3) followed by adjectives and general adverbs other than state, (4) the farthest from the verb are words or phrases expressing time and phrases expressing reasons, purposes, etc. The following two sentences are not in line with this order:
　　(15) I think that how a person becomes a hero from never being a hero is also something that everyone wants to know. (Teaching)
　　(16) Most of the Hui people in Guizhou migrated from Yunnan at the end of the Qing Dynasty after the failure of Du Wenxiu's uprising. (Periodical)
　　(15) "How" should be moved before "from." (16) "From Yunnan" should be moved after "after Du Wenxiu's uprising failed" ("because of" and "after" can only use one).
　　However, the most common mistake is not this kind, but failing to recognize the subordinate relationship of an adjunct, thus resulting in mismatched labels. For example:
　　(17) Not enough attention is paid to the development of water sources and the construction of brick wells. (Manuscript)
　　(18) After about half an hour, people handed in their papers one after another. (Work)
　　(19) The cold wind blowing in my face couldn't help but make me shiver. (Manuscript)
　　(20) In the new society, the task of prisons is not only passively to prevent crime, but also actively to educate and reform criminals. (Periodical)
　　(21) Fifteen states in the United States prohibit blacks from enjoying equal status with whites in entertainment venues. (Newspaper)
　　(22) And various academic institutions also fully demonstrate the spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance, and fully cooperate with each other in the work that should be done together. (Periodical)
　　It should be: (17) "not enough," (18) "people one after another," (19) "couldn't help but shiver," (20) "not only passively prevent crime... but also actively educate criminals," (21) "enjoy equal status with whites," (22) "fully cooperate with each other in...".
　　Sometimes, in order to emphasize an adjunct, we often advance it. Examples that have not taken this into account are as follows:
　　(23) Minister Lu's words were spoken to the workers of Xinhua Bookstore. These words, today, seem to be a bit too high-sounding for general publishers, but we believe... (Newspaper)
　　In order to compare with the workers of Xinhua Bookstore, "for general publishers" should be placed before "these words."
　　The above are all adjuncts before the verb. Some adjuncts are suitable to be placed after the verb, such as live "in Beijing," go "to the door." But the following three sentences do not belong to this category:
　　(24) The members of the group are almost always learning, living, and working together. (Periodical)
　　(25) For a whole thousand years, calligraphers and sculptors have continuously left their magnificent and unparalleled works in this cave and on this wall in the Western Region. (Newspaper)
　　(26) We want to distribute these cultural relics and books to various regions with emphasis, in addition to enriching the several museums and libraries in the central government. (Periodical)
　　(24) It should be "learning, living, and working together." (25) "In this cave and on this wall in the Western Region" should be placed before "left." The "着" in "遗留着" is also inappropriate (the action of "遗留" cannot be sustained), and it should be changed to "留下."
　　(26) "In addition to enriching... outside" should be placed after "books."
　　Position of function words. Some adverbs and conjunctions can have several positions, and we must arrange them in the most appropriate position in each sentence. The following are examples of inappropriate arrangements:
　　(27) If we don't quickly check the land-tilling work now, the land in front of us will not be well weeded, and by the time of wheat harvest and summer planting, I am afraid there will be more problems. (Newspaper)
　　(28) Around the May Fourth Movement, Marxism-Leninism began to be introduced, so that the Chinese people's revolution has today's achievements. (Periodical)
　　(29) To describe a person's appearance, you can write fifteen or sixteen pages, but this does not convey his portrait. (Teaching)
　　(30) If the ideas in a work are problematic, then even if the writing is very good, it is still undesirable. (Work)
　　(31) As a result, Zhou Chenglin suddenly increased from owning two hundred mu of land to seven hundred mu. (Teaching)
　　(32) Make all aspects of the district party and government understand that the women's representative meeting not only does not hinder the completion of the current central task, but also realize that only by mobilizing women to participate in various tasks can the work be more extensive and in-depth. (Periodical)
　　(27) It should be "don't quickly now." (28) It should be "only then make the Chinese people's revolution." (29) It should be "can describe a person's appearance." ("Convey portrait" is also inappropriate, "portrait" should be changed to "expression.") (30) It should be "even if the writing is very good." Taking the original sentence out of context, it becomes only the writing is undesirable, not the work is undesirable. (31) "By" and "to" should be symmetrical, so if it is not changed to "suddenly increased from owning two hundred mu of land to owning seven hundred mu of land" (which is very clumsy), it should be changed to "the land owned suddenly increased from two hundred mu to seven hundred mu." (32) "Not only" and "but also" also require symmetrical positions, so it should be changed to "not only understand... but also realize that only... more in-depth" ("to" and "realize this point" should both be deleted).
　　Other examples. The following five sentences only need to change the order of some words, without adding or deleting:
　　(33) The work of the trial telephone increased efficiency sixteen times. (Periodical)
　　(34) In this way, the principle of all-round development is very correct and reasonable to put forward today. (Periodical)
　　(35) In order to make the members understand this earth-shattering revolutionary movement more deeply, the Ministry of Culture and Education is preparing... (Document)
　　(36) In Southeast Asia, before the war, this fertile land produced ninety percent of the world's rubber production and nearly sixty percent of the tin. (Newspaper)
　　(37) In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, the people's judicial organs at all levels have previously given blows and suppressions to counter-revolutionary activities, and have achieved some results; but in retrospect, there is a regret of "insufficient suppression and excessive leniency."
　　(33) Should be changed to "increased work efficiency." (34) Should be changed to "to put forward the principle of all-round development today." (35) Should be changed to "make the members...". (36) Should be changed to "Before the war, this fertile land in Southeast Asia." (37) Should be changed to "previously, although in order to...". The following four sentences need to modify the words in addition to the order:
　　(38) Dominica - a small country with less than half the population of Shanghai. (Periodical)
　　(39) For example, the output of coal and steel ingots will increase by another 50% this year compared to 1940. (Periodical)
　　(40) The collection of reference materials is not about listing many, and the ultimate goal is indeed to put them to use. (Periodical)
　　(41) Of course, today we cannot ignore the fact that some young students are employed halfway before graduating. (Periodical)
　　(38) Should be changed to "population less than half of Shanghai's." (39) Should be changed to "this year compared to 1940." (40) Should be changed to "the purpose is not to be complete, but to be used." (41) Should be changed to "some students are employed halfway before graduating." According to the original sentence, it is all the "students" who are not waiting to graduate, and only "some people" are employed halfway, which is incomprehensible.
　　In short, the order of words is very important. If the order is arranged appropriately, the meaning will be correct and clear; if the arrangement is inappropriate, the meaning will be obscure, ambiguous, and even incomprehensible. (End of this paragraph, end of entire text)

    语法、修辞讲话（第四讲）
    吕叔湘  朱德熙
            第五段  词语的次序
    句子的结构，基本上就是一个安排各个成分的次序的问题。这一段讨论的范围当然没有这么广，只限于以前几段没有谈到的一部分，主要地是附加成分的位置。这些词语放错了地方，一般地不至于根本改变句子的意思，但是不合于习惯，也多半不合于逻辑。
    名词的附加语。汉语的习惯，名词的附加语通常只能放在前头（例外已见第四段），不像一般欧洲语言能够前后分开来安放。因此，不止有一个附加语的时候，就发生次序问题。这个问题并不简单，但是这里只能很简单地说一说。一般的顺序是：（一）最靠近被附加语的是不表领属关系的名词，（二）其次是形容词，（三）动词和以动词为主体的短语，（四）数词和指示代词（“这”“那”“每”“各”“其他”等），（五）表领属关系的以及表时间和地点的名词和代词，（六）离被附加语最远的是句子形式。例如“我们的一位有多年教学经验的优秀的数学教师”，“我所知道的去年华北的小麦的平均产量”。重要的例外是（四）的位置。（四）有时候在（三）之后，甚至在（二）之后。这个顺序通常表示（三）或（二）有择别作用，比如“最优秀的一部五彩影片”和“一部优秀的五彩影片”，“发表过的（那）三篇文章”和“（那）三篇发表过的文章”。但是也不定都有这个含义，例如“疏疏朗朗的两排树”。
    底下这些句子里的附加语的次序是不合于一般习惯的：
    （一）许多附近的妇女、老人和孩子都跑来看他们。（期）
    （二）在这个基础上，合作性的各种变工可以组织起来。（期）
    （三）我们和男同学一样地可以参加空军、海军、坦克、炮兵、通讯、公安、军医、以及各种其他的国防建设。（期）
    （四）头上光秃秃的，只剩几根数得清的头发飘在后面。（稿）
    （五）即以华尔讷的剥离、破坏、盗窃为唯一拒绝他们的理由。（期）
    （六）在新中国的建设事业上，发挥着他们无穷的蕴藏着的力量。（期）
    （七）否则他们无法延缓国内经济因市场缺乏而促成的危机。（期）
    应该是（一）“附近的许多妇女”（二）“各种合作性的变工”（三）“其他各种国防建设”（四）“数得清的几根头发”（五）“拒绝他们的唯一理由”（六）“蕴藏着的无穷的力量”（七）“因市场缺乏而促成的国内经济危机”。底下这五句也都不合于上述原则，同时还产生歧义：
    （八）英勇的中国人民解放军，在千千万万解放区人民的支援下，在东北、华北、华东和西北各战场彻底地粉碎了敌人的进攻。（报）
    （九）里面陈列着各式各样列宁过去所使用的东西和文件。（期）
    （十）他们说，德文能够表现极抽象的别的文字不能表现的思想。（期）
    （十一）女工工作做得好，可以解决一些女工特有的切身问题。（期）
    （十二）在伤员的耳垂上取了一滴血，放在玻璃片上百分之一的一滴枸橼酸生理食盐水里。（书）
    为了避免读成“千千万万解放区”“各式各样列宁”（这是大概不至于的），“极抽象的别的文字”“一些女工”（这是很有可能的），“百分之一的一滴”（这是不大好讲也不合事实的），这五句应该改做（八）“解放区千千万万人民”，（九）“列宁过去所使用的各式各样东西”（“使用……文件”欠通），（十）“别的文字不能表现的极抽象的思想”，（十一）“女工特有的一些切身问题”，（十二）“一滴百分之一的枸橼酸生理食盐水”（百份生理食盐水里含有一份枸橼酸）。
    数量的两种表示法。“半张纸”和“纸的一半”各有适宜的用处。底下这两句都用的不恰当，应该倒过来：
    （十三）工作者的多数是在反动派统治区的电影圈子里过来的。（期）
    （十四）目前约有三分之二的全世界钨砂产量是在各民主阵营国家的掌握中。（期）
    （十三）没有用“工作者的多数”的必要，改做“多数工作者”爽快得多。（十四）为了避免“三分之二的全世界”的歧义，应该改做“全世界的钨砂产量约有三分之二”，“各”字也应该放在“国”字前头（去“家”）。
    动词的附加语。一般的顺序是：（一）表示状态的形容词紧靠着动词，（二）其次是表示地点或方向的词或短语，（三）其次是状态以外的形容词和一般副词，（四）离动词最远的是表示时间的词或短语和表示原因、目的等等的短语。像底下这两句就是不合于这个顺序的：
    （十五）我想，一个人从不英雄怎样变成英雄，也是大家愿意知道的。（教）
    （十六）贵州的回族大多是清末从云南因杜文秀起义失败后移入的。（期）
    （十五）的“怎样”该挪在“从”的前头。（十六）的“从云南”应该挪在“杜文秀起义失败后”的后头（“因”和“后”只能用一个）。
    不过一般常见的错误不是这一类，是没认清某一个附加语的隶属关系，因而弄成张冠李戴。例如：
    （十七）开发水源及修打砖井十分注意的不够。（稿）
    （十八）大约半点钟光景，有人陆续交卷了。（作）
    （十九）迎面吹过来的寒风不禁使我打了个冷战。（稿）
    （二十）在新社会里，监狱的任务，非但消极地在于防止犯罪，而且积极地在于教育犯人，改造犯人。（期）
    （二一）美国有十五个州禁止黑人在娱乐场所与白人享有平等的地位。（报）
    （二二）而各个学术机关也是充分的表现合作互助精神，充分的对于应该该合力以成的工作，无不协力以从事。（期）
    应该是：（十七）“十分不够”，（十八）“陆续有人”，（十九）“不禁打了个冷战”，（二十）“不但是消极地防止犯罪……而且是积极地教育犯人”，（二一）“享有与白人平等的地位”，（二二）“对于……无不充分的协力以从事”。
    有时候，为了加重某一个附加语，我们常常把它提前。没有照顾到这一点的例子如：
    （二三）陆部长的话，是对新华书店的工作者说的。这些话，在今天，对于一般出版业者，似乎稍嫌陈义过高，但我们相信……（报）
    为了跟新华书店的工作者对比，应该把“对于一般出版业者”放在“这些话”的前面。
    以上讲的都是动词前的附加语。有些附加语是宜于放在动词之后的，如：住“在北京”，走“到门口”。但是底下这三句都不属于这一类：
    （二四）小组成员差不多总是学习、生活、劳动在一起的。（期）
    （二五）整整的一千年间，书家们和雕塑家们绵绵不绝地遗留着他们的弘伟无比的作品，在这西陲的洞中和壁上。（报）
    （二六）我们想把这些文物和图书有重点的分配到各地区去，除了充实中央的几个博物院图书馆之外。（期）
    （二四）应该是“在一起学习、生活、劳动”。（二五）的“在这西陲的洞中和壁上”应该放在“遗留着”的前面。“遗留着”的“着”字也不妥（“遗留”这个动作是不能持续的），应该改做“留下”。
    （二六）的“除了充实……之外”应该放在“图书”的后头。
    虚字的位置。有些副词和连接词是可以有好几个位置的，我们必须在每个句子里把它安排在最适当的位置上。底下是安排得不适当的例子：
    （二七）如果趁现在不快检查一下代耕工作，眼前地就锄不好，到麦收夏种时，恐怕会有更多的问题发生。（报）
    （二八）五四运动前后开始介绍了马列主义，使中国人民革命才有今日的成就。（期）
    （二九）把一个人的外表，可以描写到十五六页，这没有传达出他的肖像来。（教）
    （三十）要是一篇作品里的思想是有问题的，那末文字即使很不错，也是要不得的。（作）
    （三一）于是周承霖由拥有二百亩田骤增至七百亩了。（教）
    （三二）使区里党政各方面了解到，妇女代表会议对完成当前的中心任务不但没有妨碍，而且对只有发动妇女参加各种工作，工作才能更广泛，更深入这一点得到体会。（期）
    （二七）应该是“不趁现在”。（二八）应该是“才使中国人民革命”。（二九）应该是“可以把一个人的外表”。（“传达肖像”也不妥，“肖像”应改做“神态”。）（三十）应该是“即使文字很不错”。照原句断章取义，就变了只是文字要不得，不是作品要不得了。（三一）的“由”和“至”的后面应该对称，所以如果不改做“由拥有二百亩田骤增至拥有七百亩田”（这是很笨的），就应该改做“拥有的田由二百亩骤增至七百亩”。（三二）的“不但”和“而且”也要求有对称的位置，所以应该改做“不但了解到……而且体会到只有……更深入”（“对”和“这一点得到”都应该删去）。
    其他的例子。下面这五句，只要改变一部分词语的次序，无须增加或删削：
    （三三）使试验电话机的工作提高了效率十六倍。（期）
    （三四）这样说来，全面发展的原则在今天提出是非常正确合理的。（期）
    （三五）文教部为了把这一惊天动地的革命运动使会员们认识得更深刻，准备……（件）
    （三六）在东南亚，战前这块肥沃的土地生产了世界产量百分之九十的橡胶，将近百分之六十的锡。（报）
    （三七）各级人民司法机关，为了巩固人民民主专政；过去对反革命活动虽曾予以打击和镇压，并获得了些成绩；但检讨起来，却有“镇压不足，宽大有余”之憾。
    （三三）应改为“工作效率提高”。（三四）应改为“在今天提出全面发展的原则”。（三五）应改为“使会员们把……”。（三六）应改为“在战前，东南亚这块肥沃的土地”。（三七）应改为“过去虽曾为了……”。下面这四句除次序外，词语也需要修改：
    （三八）多米尼加——不足上海人口一半的小国家。（期）
    （三九）例如煤和钢块的产量，比之一九四○年，今年又将提高五成。（期）
    （四十）参考资料的搜集，不在罗列众多，最终目的确在于致用。（期）
    （四一）当然今天咱们并不能忽视青年同学们不待毕业就有人半途就业的事实。（期）
    （三八）应改为“人口不到上海的一半”。（三九）应改为“今年比一九四○年”。（四十）应改为“目的不在于齐备，而在于致用”。（四一）应改为“同学中有人不待毕业就……”。照原句讲，不待毕业的是全部“同学”，而半途就业的只是“有人”，这是讲不通的。
    总之，词语的次序是很重要的。次序安排得适当，意思就正确而明显；安排得不适当，意思就会晦涩、含糊、甚至不通。（本段完，全文未完）
