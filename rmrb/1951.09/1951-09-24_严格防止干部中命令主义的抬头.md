    Strictly Prevent the Rise of Commandism Among Cadres
    Zhang Changzhen
    Commandism is a fatal flaw in our work, a working method that runs counter to the mass line. However, this bad style is often not corrected once and for all, and we must constantly fight against it.
    In the Yibei Special District of Chahar Province, after the rectification movement last year, the ideology of Party members and cadres was significantly improved, and the commandist style of work was greatly changed. However, some people at that time failed to truly recognize the harm of commandism to the work. They just dared not to impose coercion on the masses under the pressure of the masses at that time. But as time passed, the old problem relapsed. In addition, in the past year, a large number of new cadres have been added to the Yibei region. They have little experience, and the leading cadres have not provided timely assistance to them. Their working methods are very rigid. Therefore, the commandist style of work has frequently appeared in the work recently. For example, the Financial Group of the Shuoxian Branch of the People's Bank of China went to the countryside to collect silver dollars, and assigned quotas to the masses, which almost led to death in Nanxinzhai Village. During the May 1st parade this year, nine district cadres and village cadres in Yingxian, Hunyuan, Zuoyun, and Guangling counties forced the masses. Zhang Kuan, a district cadre in the Eighth District of Yingxian County, went to Xiaosuiren Village to organize the masses to dig canals. Because he could not gather people for a while, he imprisoned eighteen farmers. From the above examples alone, we can see the seriousness of the commandist style of work. If it is not corrected and stopped, the revolutionary cause will be damaged.
    Why do coercive orders continue to occur?
    First of all, some comrades still do not understand that the policies of the Party and the People's Government are formulated from the interests of the masses and rely on the masses to implement them. In the work, the masses may have temporarily incomprehensible points, which should be clarified and patiently persuaded, rather than standing above the masses, issuing orders, and going one's own way. Specifically, the starting points of these comrades' coercion are roughly as follows: Most of the new cadres, because of the heavy and urgent work tasks, have few methods and no experience. In order to complete the tasks, they do not care about the method. Although they want to do their job well, they are divorced from the masses, resulting in the opposite effect. For example, the work of exchanging silver dollars is very beneficial to the people, but it caused dissatisfaction among the masses due to the poor working methods. Another group of cadres regard themselves as heroic figures who bring benefits to the masses, and want the masses to obey them. They beat and scold the masses for any slight violation. The case of Zhang Kuan, a district cadre in Yingxian County, imprisoning the masses for digging canals, is a representative of this view. Still another group of people are of extremely bad character and cannot be said to serve the people at all. They completely inherited the bad habits of the Kuomintang and feudal warlords.
    The fact that lower-level cadres are prone to commandist style is closely related to the ideological style of the leading cadres. After the rectification movement last year, the style of cadres has indeed improved greatly, but some leading cadres did not seize the opportunity to continue to educate cadres in order to completely overcome the commandist style. On the contrary, they relaxed. The specific manifestation is that the ideological leadership of cadres is very poor. For example, after serious problems occur or are dealt with, instead of educating cadres with specific examples, the matter is over; when assigning tasks, they are not clearly explained, and there is little specific help for cadres. Even some leading cadres treat work with a purely task-oriented view, so that the basic method of completing tasks - the mass line - cannot be implemented into the minds of general cadres; what is even worse is that some leading cadres condone the commandist style of lower-level cadres; there is a lack of criticism and self-criticism within the Party. District-level cadres often do not participate in organizational life for three or five months, and some units do not hold meetings related to checking ideological style for a long time, so they cannot prevent and stop the occurrence and development of various bad ideological styles.
    How can we effectively correct and stop the commandist style among cadres?
    First of all, we should strengthen the ideological education of Party members and cadres. This is the most basic and most important. Most Party members and cadres, especially new cadres, are of non-proletarian origin, and the old society has given them bad influences, and their revolutionary experience is insufficient, so that their ideological consciousness and style inevitably violate Marxism and therefore violate the interests of the Party and the people on many issues. Therefore, we must strengthen the education of the Party's mass line for them, improve their ideological level and policy level, and teach them to understand that the mass line is the fundamental political and organizational line of our Party; only by believing in the masses and relying on the masses can we better complete the tasks and make fewer or no mistakes. Every leading cadre and cadre management agency should put the ideological education of cadres on the work agenda. Study the ideological situation of cadres and help cadres continuously improve their ideological level. This is the fundamental method to prevent the commandist style.
    Secondly, we should strengthen discipline education and improve the awareness of each Party member and cadre to abide by discipline. And to carry out discipline education, we must cooperate with the development of mass criticism and self-criticism. The reason why the commandist style of cadres in the Yibei Special District has developed is greatly related to the daily lack of criticism and self-criticism. Yingxian County has noticed this problem and has focused on launching an ideological struggle against commandism among cadres.
    Thirdly, leading cadres should strive to explain clearly when assigning tasks and give cadres specific guidance. Some leading cadres simply mention "must publicize and mobilize, no coercion" when assigning tasks, which cannot help cadres overcome the commandist style.
    Fourthly, while improving the working style of district and village cadres, we should strengthen the work of the village people's congress to promote democracy, give play to the power of the masses, give cadres necessary supervision, and better complete various work tasks.

### 严格防止干部中命令主义的抬头

    严格防止干部中命令主义的抬头
    张长珍
    命令主义作风，是工作的致命伤，是与群众路线背道而驰的工作方法。但这种坏作风往往不是一次纠正得了的，应当经常与之作斗争。
    察哈尔省雁北专区，经过去年整风运动，党员、干部的思想显著提高，命令主义作风曾大为改变。但有一部分人在那时没有能够真正认识到命令主义作风对工作的危害性，只是在当时群众的压力下，不敢再对群众施行强迫命令罢了；但事过境迁，旧病复发。加之近一年来，雁北全区增加了大批新干部，他们的经验少，领导干部又没有及时地给以帮助，他们的工作方法非常生硬；因此，近来命令主义作风在工作中又经常出现。譬如，中国人民银行朔县分行金融小组下乡收兑银元，硬给群众分配数字，南新宅村为此几乎逼出人命。今年“五一”游行时，应县、浑源、左云、广灵等四县，有九个区干部村干部强制群众。应县八区区干部张宽，到小穗稔村组织群众开渠，因为一时召集不起人，就禁闭了十八个农民。仅从上述几个例子，已可以看出命令主义作风的严重程度，如不加以纠正、制止，革命事业将会受到损失。
    为什么强迫命令的现象不断发生呢？
    首先，是有些同志还不了解党和人民政府的政策，都是从群众利益出发来制定，并依靠群众来执行的。在工作中，群众可能有暂时想不通的地方，这就应该讲清道理，耐心说服，而不是站在群众之上，发号施令，一意孤行。具体来说，这些同志强迫命令的出发点大致有如下几种：多数的新干部，因工作任务繁重、急迫，办法少，没经验，为了完成任务，就不管方式。他们虽然想把工作作好，因脱离群众，结果适得其反。如兑换银元等工作，虽十分有利于人民，但因工作方式不好，而引起群众的不满。另一部分干部，则把自己看成是给群众造福的英雄人物，要群众百依百顺；群众对他们稍有违犯，就打骂交加。应县区干部张宽为开渠禁闭群众一事，是持有这种观点的代表人物。再一部分人，是品质异常恶劣，根本谈不上为人民服务，完全是因袭了国民党、封建军阀的恶劣作风。
    一般下级干部容易犯强迫命令作风，与领导干部的思想作风是有着密切关联的。去年整风运动之后，干部作风确有很大改进，但有些领导干部并未抓紧时机，继续教育干部，以求彻底克服强迫命令作风，相反地是松懈下来了。具体的表现是对干部的思想领导很差。如发生或处理了严重问题之后，不是以具体事例教育干部，而是事情一过，也就算了；布置任务时，交代得不清楚，对干部具体帮助少，甚至某些领导干部对待工作也是单纯任务观点，这样就不能把完成任务的基本方法——群众路线，贯彻到一般干部思想里去；更甚的是某些领导干部纵容姑息下级干部的强迫命令作风；党内缺乏批评与自我批评，区级干部常常三、五个月不过组织生活，某些单位长期不召开有关检查思想作风的会议，因而也就不能防范、制止各种不良思想作风的发生和发展。
    如何才能有效地纠正与制止干部中的强迫命令作风呢？
    首先，应加强对党员、干部的思想教育。这是最基本的和最主要的。大部分党员、干部，特别是新干部，因为他们是非无产阶级出身的，旧社会给予了不良影响，以及革命锻炼不足，就使得他们的思想意识和作风，不可避免地在许多问题上，是违背马克思主义因而也是违背党与人民利益的。因此，必须对他们加强党的群众路线教育，提高他们的思想水平和政策水平，教导他们懂得群众路线是我们党的根本的政治路线和组织路线；进行一切工作只有相信群众、依靠群众，才能更好地完成任务，才能不犯或少犯错误。每一个领导干部和干部管理机构，应把对干部的思想教育，放到工作日程上。研究干部的思想情况，并帮助干部不断提高思想水平。这是预防强迫命令作风的根本方法。
    其次，加强纪律教育，提高每个党员、干部遵守纪律的自觉性。而进行纪律教育，又必须配合以开展群众性的批评与自我批评。目前雁北专区干部的强迫命令作风之所以得到发展，与日常缺乏批评与自我批评有极大关系。应县已注意到这一问题，已有重点地在干部中展开了反对强迫命令主义的思想斗争。
    第三，领导干部在布置任务时，应力求交代清楚，并给干部以具体指导。某些领导干部在布置任务时，只简单提一下“必须宣传动员，不许强迫”，是不能帮助干部克服强迫命令的作风的。
    第四，与改进区村干部工作作风同时，应加强村人民代表会的工作，以发扬民主，发挥群众力量，给干部以必要的监督，更好地完成各项工作任务。
