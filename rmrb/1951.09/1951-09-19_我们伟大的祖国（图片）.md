    Our Great Motherland
    In early July, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army solemnly held a celebration rally in a certain area on the Korean front. Volunteer Army heroes who had performed meritorious service twice or more in the Korean War received "Military Service Medals" awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They unanimously expressed their determination to carry forward past glories in future battles and to repay the love of the Korean people with even greater victories.
