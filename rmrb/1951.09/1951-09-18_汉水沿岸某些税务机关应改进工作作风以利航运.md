Some Tax Authorities Along the Han River Should Improve Their Work Style to Benefit Shipping
Editor:

During July and August this year, I traveled by private boat (cargo ship) from Ankang along the Han River to Laohekou. According to the water level at that time, it should have taken four days to arrive, but it took five and a half days. The reason was that the office hours of the tax authorities (8:00 am to 6:00 pm, with a two-hour lunch break) did not match the sailing hours (from dawn to dusk). When the boat arrived at a place to check tickets and inspect the hold, it was after the tax bureau's office hours, so the procedures could not be completed, and the boat could not leave. For example, boats arriving after 6:00 pm had to wait until after 8:00 am the next day to have their tickets checked and the hold inspected, and it would be almost 10:00 am before they could depart. This delayed a very long period of sailing time. Some comrades in the Tianhekou Tax Office did not work during office hours, delaying everyone even more. At 11:00 am on August 11th, the boat arrived at the location, and the boatmen rushed to the tax office to request ticket inspection and hold inspection, but they were eating and could not go. After eating and resting, they still did not work. It was not until 3:00 pm that they stamped the tax票 (tax certificate/receipt), did not inspect the hold, and let the boat go. We are extremely dissatisfied with this bureaucratic work style that lacks a mass viewpoint.

The exchange of local products from southern Shaanxi and industrial products from Wuhan mainly relies on Han River transportation. If the above situation can be changed, it will greatly benefit the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

I suggest that the tax authorities along the Han River implement a duty system outside of office hours to facilitate navigation.

### 汉水沿岸某些税务机关应改进工作作风以利航运

    汉水沿岸某些税务机关应改进工作作风以利航运编辑同志：
    今年七、八月间，我由安康沿汉水乘民船（货船）到老河口。按当时水量，本可四天到达，但却走了五天半。原因是税务机关的办公时间（上午八时至下午六时、中午休息二小时）与行船时间（从黎明到傍晚）不符，船到验票查舱的地方，过了税务局办公时间，办不了手续，就不能走。譬如，下午六时以后到的船，就要等到第二天上午八时以后才能验票查舱，差不多要到十点钟左右才能开行。这样就耽误了一段很长的行船时间。天河口税务所有些工作同志，在办公时间不办公，耽误了大家更多的时间。八月十一日上午十一时，船到该地，船工赶赴税务所请验票查舱，但他们正吃饭，不能去。饭后休息，又不办公。一直等到下午三点，他们在税票上盖了章，舱也不查，就放这只船走了。我们对这种缺乏群众观念的官僚主义作风极为不满。
    陕南土产品和武汉工业品的交流，主要是依靠汉水运输，如能改变上述情况，对城乡物资的交流，会有很大的好处。
    我建议沿汉水的税务机关，在办公时间外，实行值班制度，以利航行。
