Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th: The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who are fighting arduously on the Korean front, have sent letters of condolence and large quantities of supplies to express their sympathy and provide relief to the compatriots in Northeast China who have suffered from floods. The letter of condolence states: "Since we went abroad to fight, we have received full support from the people of the motherland, especially the people of Northeast China, and have therefore achieved great victories. We are constantly thinking about and caring for the people of the motherland. From the recent news from the motherland, we have learned that there has been too much rain in Northeast China this summer, causing some areas to suffer from floods. Our compatriots have suffered from a lack of clothing and food, and their lives are very difficult. All comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are extremely concerned about this and extend our heartfelt condolences to all affected compatriots."
    The letter concludes with the hope that the affected compatriots will quickly organize themselves for production and self-reliance, relying on their own hard work and efforts to restore and rebuild their homes.
    The relief supplies sent include 11,589 pieces of various single-layer garments, lined garments, and woolen garments, 7,511 pieces of cotton-padded clothes and cotton-padded overcoats, 1,196 cotton quilts, 57 quilt covers, 194 leather and cotton mattresses, 14,634 hats, 2,910 scarves, 511 pairs of cotton shoes, and 232 pairs of felt socks.
