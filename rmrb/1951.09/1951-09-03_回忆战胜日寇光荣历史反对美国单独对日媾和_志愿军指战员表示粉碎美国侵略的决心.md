Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front: On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held discussion meetings during lulls in fighting, recalling the glorious history of the Chinese people's victory over the Japanese invaders and discussing the US's separate peace treaty with Japan and the issue of rearming Japan. Many of these anti-aggression warriors personally participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and many others suffered from the poison of Japanese aggression. During the discussion meetings, they unanimously denounced the American bandits, who were even more brutal than the Japanese invaders. The soldiers discussed the US aggressors' willful sabotage of the Kaesong armistice talks and their blatant formulation of a unilateral "peace treaty" with Japan in conjunction. They pointed out that these two events fully demonstrated that the US aggressors would never abandon their aggression against China, Korea, and other Asian countries. To ensure lasting peace for the people of Asia, the only way is to resolutely take action to crush US imperialism's aggression and firmly oppose its heinous conspiracy to rearm Japan. Feng Chuanxiang, the company commander of the First Company of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Daochengyun Hero Company" for breaking through the 38th parallel in the New Year Offensive, said: "If the United States dares to undermine peace, we will have more strength to defend peace. If it insists on carrying out a war of aggression, we will not be afraid to carry out a just war of resistance against aggression." A political commissar of a certain Volunteer Army unit who fought bravely against the Japanese寇for eight years said: "The history of the War of Resistance Against Japan proves that since the Chinese people were able to defeat the enemy under conditions of inferior equipment, they will be even more capable of defeating the enemy after their equipment has been improved. In the Korean War, our equipment was not as good as the enemy's, but we defeated the enemy. Now our equipment conditions have gradually improved, and if the US aggressors dare to continue their aggression, we will have even greater confidence in defeating them."
Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission issued.

    回忆战胜日寇光荣历史反对美国单独对日媾和
    志愿军指战员表示粉碎美国侵略的决心
        【本报讯】据新华社朝鲜前线记者报道：我国人民志愿军的指战员们在抗日战争胜利六周年节日前夕的战斗空隙中举行座谈会，回忆中国人民战胜日寇的光荣斗争史，和讨论美国单独对日媾和与重新武装日本问题。这些反侵略的勇士们，有不少亲身参加过抗日战争，也有不少遭受过日寇侵略的毒害。他们在座谈会中一致痛斥残暴胜似日寇的美国强盗。战士们把美国侵略者肆意破坏开城停战谈判和悍然制订片面的对日“和约”两件事联系起来讨论。他们指出，这两件事充分说明了美国侵略者是绝对不会放弃侵略中国、朝鲜和亚洲各国的。要想使亚洲人民得到持久和平，只有坚决地用行动来粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，坚决反对它重新武装日本的罪恶阴谋。在新年攻势中突破三八线因而荣膺“道成岘英雄连”称号的某部第一连连长冯传祥说：“美国敢于破坏和平，我们就更有力量捍卫和平。他要坚持进行侵略战争，我们就不怕进行坚决的反侵略的正义战争。”曾经与日寇奋战八年的一位志愿军某部政治委员说：“抗日战争的历史证明了中国人民既然能够在劣势装备的条件下打败敌人，那末在装备获得改善后就更能打败敌人。在朝鲜战争中，我们的装备不如敌人，可是我们战胜了敌人。现在我们的装备条件逐渐有了改善，如果美国侵略者敢于继续坚持侵略的话，我们就有更大的把握可以打败它。”中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会发表
