The entire staff of the Central Research Institute of Culture and History, an organization of senior scholars in the domestic academic community, held a symposium in Beijing on the issue of the separate US-UK peace treaty with Japan.符定一 Fu Dingyi, the director of the institute, deputy directors柳亚子 Liu Yazi, 叶恭绰 Ye Gongchuo, 章士钊 Zhang Shizhao, and institute members 齐白石 Qi Baishi, 潘龄皋 Pan Linggao, 陈半丁 Chen Banding, 黄浚 Huang Jun, 康同璧 Kang Tongbi, 萧龙友 Xiao Longyou, and more than thirty others, all venerable scholars aged from over sixty to over ninety, were in attendance. Since the draft of the separate US-UK peace treaty with Japan was announced, the institute's members have been very indignant and have convened meetings twice on August 25th and 29th to discuss it. On September 1st, the institute held another meeting for all members, and the elderly attendees furiously denounced the absurdity and shamelessness of the separate US-UK peace treaty with Japan.

The symposium was chaired by符定一 Fu Dingyi. He said: The unilateral peace treaty with Japan by the US and UK is a false treaty. This false treaty is completely inconsistent with the reality of major international events. China suffered the most from Japanese aggression, contributed the most to fighting Japan, is the closest to Japan, and has the largest population and land area in Asia. But the so-called peace treaty with Japan does not have China's participation, which is extremely hypocritical. The Chinese people will never recognize this kind of false treaty. Afterwards, 叶恭绰 Ye Gongchuo, 康和声 Kang Hesheng, 刘?园 Liu?yuan, 邢之襄 Xing Zhixiang, 夏仁虎 Xia Renhu, 梁启勋 Liang Qixun, 查安荪 Cha Ansun, 罗介丘 Luo Jieqiu, 刘武 Liu Wu, 巢功常 Chao Gongchang, 邢端 Xing Duan, 陈半丁 Chen Banding, 楚中元 Chu Zhongyuan, 叶瑞棻 Ye Ruifen, 齐之彪 Qi Zhibiao and more than ten other people spoke enthusiastically. The speakers all believed that the so-called peace treaty with Japan by the US and UK is essentially a treaty preparing for war, and a conspiracy to rearm Japan and launch another aggression against China and the people of Asia. Many elderly people, based on their personal experiences, explained that after years of suffering from imperialist aggression and oppression under reactionary Chinese rule, they have finally obtained a peaceful and happy life in the new China. Therefore, they are extremely indignant at the new acts of aggression by the US and UK. 刘?园 Liu?yuan said: "In our twilight years, our desire for peace is even more urgent, but we must still rise up and resist the robbers who destroy peace." 查安荪 Cha Ansun said: "We are all old men, but we all have children and grandchildren. We do not want to be slaves, and our children and grandchildren do not want to be slaves. We and our children and grandchildren have the strength to fight against the enemy." Some of the elderly attendees were family members of soldiers and commanders of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and some had personally experienced the cruelty of Japanese invaders. They all emphasized that the Chinese people must continue to strengthen their resistance to the US and aid to Korea. In the previous two discussions at the institute, several elderly people had already decided to donate a certain amount of money each month to purchase airplanes and cannons. The 82-year-old famous doctor 萧龙友 Xiao Longyou attended the meeting, but because of illness he could not say much, so he wrote: "I am determined to support the opposition to American imperialism." The 91-year-old painter 齐白石 Qi Baishi did not attend the meeting due to his old age, but he also submitted a written statement to the symposium: "The United States and Japan are separately making peace, with the aim of invading China. I firmly oppose it." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 文史研究馆全体人员反对美英单独对日媾和

    文史研究馆全体人员反对美英单独对日媾和
    国内学术界耆老所组织的文史研究馆的全体人员，一日在京举行座谈会，讨论美英单独对日媾和问题。文史研究馆馆长符定一，副馆长柳亚子、叶恭绰、章士钊，馆员齐白石、潘龄皋、陈半丁、黄浚、康同璧、萧龙友等三十余人，都是六十多岁到九十多岁高龄的硕学老人。自从美英单独对日和约草案公布后，该馆同人都非常愤慨，曾在八月二十五日及二十九日两次集会讨论。九月一日该馆又举行了全馆性的座谈会，到会的老人纷纷痛斥美英单独对日媾和的荒谬和无耻。
    座谈会由符定一主持。他说：美英单独对日媾和的片面和约是一种伪约。这伪约是与国际重大事件的真实性完全不符的。中国受日本残害最大、打日本出力最多，距离日本最近，人口土地也是亚洲最大最多的。但所谓对日和约竟无中国参加，那岂不是虚伪透顶？中国人民任何时候都不能承认此种伪约。会上继有叶恭绰、康和声、刘?园、邢之襄、夏仁虎、梁启勋、查安荪、罗介丘、刘武、巢功常、邢端、陈半丁、楚中元、叶瑞棻、齐之彪等十余人热烈发言。发言者都认为美英的所谓对日和约，实质上是准备战争的条约，是阴谋重新武装日本，再来侵略中国和亚洲人民的条约。许多老人结合亲身的经历，说明自己在多年的帝国主义侵略残害和中国反动统治的压迫后，好不容易才得到了在新中国的和平幸福的生活。因此他们对美英的新侵略行为激愤异常。刘?园说：“我们以垂暮之年，争取和平之心更切，但对破坏和平的强盗，我们还是要奋起反抗的。”查安荪说：“我们都是老头子，但我们都有儿孙。我们不愿作奴隶，我们的儿孙也不愿作奴隶。我们和我们的儿孙是有力量同敌人斗争的。”到会的老人有的是中国人民志愿军指战员的家属，有的曾身经日寇的残害，他们都强调中国人民要继续加强抗美援朝。在该馆前两次的讨论会中，已经有几位老人决定了每月捐献一定数目的款项购买飞机大炮。八十二岁的老名医萧龙友到会后，因病不能多说话，他写道：“对于反对美国帝国主义，我决心赞成。”九十一岁的老画家齐白石因年老未到会，但也向座谈会提出书面意见：“美国和日本单独媾和，目的在侵略中国。我坚决反对。”（新华社）
