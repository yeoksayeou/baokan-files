Hebei Cangxian Special District, since October 1949, various counties (towns) have generally convened five to six sessions of the People's Representative Conference and established standing committees. After the election work in the spring of 1951, the organization of the People's Representative Conference was further purified and improved, and the representativeness of the representatives was gradually strengthened.

Through the convening of the People's Representative Conference, first of all, various policies were implemented, promoting the development of various tasks and laying a good foundation for future work. At each meeting, the central work of each period and the current major tasks were studied and discussed, the problems that the masses urgently demanded to solve were resolved, and the representatives promptly conveyed them to the broad masses of people, turning them into conscious actions of the masses. For example, this year's summer grain requisition was generally completed and put into storage in about ten days, and the grain was overfulfilled by more than 4.6 million jin; this year's spring labor to harness the river was ten times greater than in previous years, and it was not only completed quickly, but also of good quality. This spring's drought-resistant planting of cotton and increased production donations greatly exceeded the plan; the Resist America, Aid Korea and suppress counter-revolution movements quickly formed an upsurge. The completion of all these tasks is inseparable from the convening of the People's Representative Conference and the enlightenment of the political awareness of the people's representatives and the broad masses of people. Secondly, the connection between the people's government and the people has been further strengthened, and the work style of cadres has been changed. Due to the convening of the representative conference, not only have various policies and decrees of the people's government met the masses more directly; but also some of the people's demands and the shortcomings and deviations in the government's implementation of work can be frequently reflected to the government through the representative conference. And generally, it can be resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. For example, the fifth meeting in Suning accepted a total of 364 proposals, 331 of which have been handled, 6 are being handled, and only 3 have not been handled (others cannot be handled). Some representatives said: "After the representatives' opinions can go up, and they will be dealt with if they are said." The people's criticism and supervision have educated the cadres and corrected the bad work style of some cadres. The work style of coercion and command has been greatly reduced. Zhang Qingtong, a cadre in Hejian District, said: "In the future, the work should be meticulous and cautious, and there will be supervision of the government." Some cadres in Jiahe County said: "Coercion and command are no longer effective, and we must do a good job in the future." Generally, cadres believe that "it will not be easy to work in the future, not only will they not be able to deliver the tasks assigned by the superiors, but they will also have nothing to say at the representative conference." At the same time, it has further improved the awareness of the people and initially established the consciousness of being the masters of the country. The broad masses of people have further realized that the people's government is their own government. They realize that they are the masters of the country. For example, a female representative from Bozhen said: "Who asked about national affairs in the past? Now we are sitting on an equal footing with the town chief and discussing issues together." Some cases in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were handed over to the representatives for discussion, which made them feel that the government was truly democratic. Zhang Hongting from Huanghua County said: "Letting the common people be judges is truly unprecedented. Such a big thing is handed over to us, we have to manage it well!" The general representatives reflected: "The government reports its work to the people and lets us inspect the government's work. It is really the people who are in charge." Therefore, the unity of people from all walks of life has been strengthened, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated.

However, in the leadership of the special district and various counties and in the thinking of cadres, the understanding of the nature and role of the People's Representative Conference is vague. They do not regard the representative conference as the basic system of the people's democratic country and the basic organizational form of the people's democratic political power. In addition, some cadres have poor democratic style and habits and lack a mass perspective, which leads to the following shortcomings and errors:
    (1) First of all, the representative conference is confused with the village cadre meeting. Although all counties have paid attention to distinguishing the scope of authority of the attending representatives and the nonvoting village cadres (nonvoting village cadres have no voting rights) in the past meetings, they are mostly reduced to formalities. There are many village cadres attending the representative conference (generally one to two times more than the representatives, and even five times more in individual areas). In addition, when discussing issues, village cadres speak more and representatives speak less, blurring the nature of the representative conference, depriving the representatives of their rights, and reducing the role of the representatives.
    (2) The convening of the meeting has not formed a system, and at the same time, there is a simple "use" point of view on the representatives. The meetings are mostly for arranging work and assigning tasks. Four of the six meetings are for arranging the autumn grain requisition, generally from the discussion of policy principles to the allocation of public grain figures to villages and reductions to households, and making specific implementation plans after returning to the village, which are handed over to the representatives and village cadres for joint implementation. Many important proposals from the people have not been seriously discussed and appropriately handled. At the first session of the Second Congress convened in Jian'guo County this year, when the adjournment was announced after the work was arranged, a representative questioned: "What about our proposals?" At this time, the meeting was extended again, and the secretary of the County People's Government gave a hasty answer to the representatives' proposals. Some have been processed and resolved, but rarely explained to the representatives. Therefore, the representatives believe that attending the meeting is for "accepting tasks." When Jiahe assigned the task of requisition to the village at the representative conference, a representative said: "I can't do it, you can talk to the village cadres!" Because the representative conference and the village cadre conference are held together, the representatives feel that "speaking at the meeting is useless." This situation is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the number of proposals is decreasing day by day, and the absenteeism of representatives is increasing day by day. For example: the first representative conference in Qing County had 354 proposals, but only 39 at the third conference; Renqiu County had a total of 270 representatives, with 9 absent from the first meeting, 10 absent from the second meeting, 56 absent from the third meeting, 108 absent from the fourth meeting, 7 absent from the fifth meeting after adjustment and re-election, and 18 absent from the sixth meeting; Hejian held the Second Session of the Second People's Representative Conference this year, with 105 absentees out of 290 representatives. The reasons for absenteeism, in addition to a few people who could not participate due to bad weather, difficult roads or illness, the most important reason is that the meeting does not respect the rights of representatives enough. The representatives feel that they have no rights and status, and they are afraid that they will not be able to complete the work tasks after accepting them, so they are unwilling to participate in the meeting. At the same time, some meetings have a lot of content, short time, and long reports, and there is little time for discussion, so the representatives cannot fully express their opinions. As a representative said:
    "The meeting is over, but the words have not been finished."
    (3) From the perspective of the composition of the representatives, there are more village cadres who are also representatives, and even if they are not village cadres, there are more activists, so the representativeness of the representatives is insufficient. According to the situation in the Fifth District of Hejian, only 5 of the 35 representatives are not cadres. In addition, there are many sand-turning workers in Jiahe County, but they only have two worker representatives. At the same time, the composition of some representatives is not pure.
    (4) Regarding the way representatives are produced, some counties have formalism and substitution biases. In Renqiu County, some representatives were designated by the village cadres after research and attended the representative conference without being elected by the people; in Qing County, in one election of representatives, in 32 villages in one district, villagers elected voter representatives to the district to elect county representatives. At that time, 104 village cadres (non-voter representatives) also participated in the election and voting in the district. This year, when the representatives were re-elected at the First Session of the Second Congress, the district cadres also studied and proposed a list of representatives who needed to be re-elected, and let the masses re-elect them, instead of letting the people discuss and re-elect their own representatives.
    (5) Although the Standing Committee has been established, there is no resident standing organization, so after the representative conference is closed, there is generally a lack of frequent contact with the representatives. Jiahe has not contacted the representatives once since the convening of the People's Representative Conference, which affects the role of the representatives.
    (6) Generally, the county (town) does not prepare enough before the meeting, and the specific leadership is not well grasped after the meeting, and it cannot notify the representatives in advance to collect and prepare proposals. When the representative conference was held for the autumn grain requisition last year, it generally failed to collect and sort out proposals in a planned manner. At the same time, the drafts submitted to the representative conference for discussion were not sufficiently prepared, the drafts were too long, and the center was not clear, making it difficult for the representatives to consider and raise questions. In addition, the government often neglects the summary report every time the representative conference is held. This is not right. The government's work and the implementation of the previous resolutions should be seriously explained to the representatives.

Due to the existence of the above problems, the influence of the People's Representative Conference in the county (town) is not deep enough among the masses, and the prestige of the representatives among the masses is not high enough.

In order to further strengthen the construction of people's democratic political power, the Cangxian Special Office, after inspecting the above shortcomings, proposed: First, it is necessary to strengthen the study of documents on the construction of people's democratic political power by cadres at all levels, clearly recognize the nature of the political power of our country, and "the People's Representative Conference or the People's Congress is the basic system of our country and our political power, and the best organizational form of the people's democratic political power", convene it regularly and in a planned manner (preferably four times a year), and make it a regular system. Secondly, do a good job in preparing for the meeting, conduct in-depth democratic education to the masses, let go of mobilizing the masses to elect good representatives, strengthen representativeness and breadth, and expand the democratic scope of elections. Thirdly, the content of the representative conference should focus on solving one or two problems that the current work and the local masses urgently need to solve, and at the same time, appropriately pay attention to solving certain problems that other sectors are concerned about and require to be solved, and seriously handle the people's proposals. Fourth, correct the phenomenon of confusion between the representative conference and the cadre conference. Finally, land reform in various counties in Cangxian Special District has been generally completed. After several years of production and construction, the people's living standards have also improved. In addition, with the development of the two major political movements of Resisting America and Aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the political awareness of the people has been greatly improved, and the people's democratic demands are quite urgent. At present, the conditions for the County People's Representative Conference to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress are already in place. In order to further strengthen the construction of people's democratic political power, it can generally exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress this winter.

    河北沧县专区检查政权建设工作
    一年来全区政权建设工作获得不少成绩，但各县领导干部思想上对人民代表会议的性质、任务认识模糊。
    河北省沧县专区，从一九四九年十月以来，各县（镇）普遍召开了五至六次各界人民代表会议，并建立了常务委员会。一九五一年春进行选举工作后，使各界人民代表会议的组织进一步的纯洁和健全，代表的广泛性也逐渐加强。
    经过人民代表会议的召开，首先贯彻了各种政策，推动了各项工作的开展，给今后工作打下了良好基础。每次会议中，都研究讨论了每一个时期的中心工作和当前重大任务，解决了当前群众迫切要求解决的问题，并经过代表及时地传达给广大人民群众，变成了群众积极自觉的行动。例如今年的夏征，一般在十日左右即全部征齐入库，且超额完成粮食四六○余万斤；今年春工治河工程大于往年十倍，不仅完成得快，而且质量好。今春抗旱点种棉花、增产捐献，均大大超过计划；抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动也很快形成热潮。所有这些工作的完成，都是和召开各界人民代表会议、启发了各界人民代表和广大群众的政治觉悟分不开的。其次进一步密切了人民政府与人民群众的联系，转变了干部的工作作风。由于代表会的召开，不仅使人民政府的各种政策法令，更直接地与群众见了面；而且人民的某些要求及对政府执行工作中所发生的缺点和偏向，亦能通过代表会经常地反映到政府中来。且一般的能得到及时、适当地解决。如肃宁五次会议，共受理提案三六四件，已办者三三一件，正办者六件，仅有三件未办（其他为不能办者）。有的代表说：“经过代表意见可以往上走，并且说了就办。”人民的批评、监督，教育了干部，使某些干部的不良作风获得纠正。强迫命令的工作作风，已大大减少。河间区干部张庆通说：“以后工作要细致谨慎，有监督政府的啦。”交河县有的干部说：“强迫命令吃不开了，今后得要好好做工作。”一般干部认为“今后工作不好做，不光交付不了上级的任务，代表会上也无话说。”同时也进一步提高了人民群众的觉悟，初步树立了主人翁的自觉，广大人民群众更进一步地认识了人民的政府是自己的政府。认识了自己是国家的主人。如泊镇妇女代表说：“过去谁问过国家大事，现在和镇长平起平坐，在一块讨论问题。”镇压反革命工作中有些案件交给代表讨论，使他们感到政府真民主。黄骅县张洪亭说：“叫老百姓当法官，真是古来未有的事，这样大的事交给咱们，可得好好管！”一般的代表反映：“政府向人民报告工作，让咱们检查政府的工作，真是人民当家了。”因而加强了各界人民的团结，进一步巩固了人民民主专政。
    但是在专区和各县的领导上与干部思想上，对人民代表会议的性质、作用认识模糊，没有把代表会看成是人民民主国家的基本制度、人民民主政权的基本组织形式，加之某些干部的民主作风、民主习惯差，缺乏群众观点，因而就产生如下的缺点和错误：
        （一）首先是代表会与村干部会混淆不清。各县在历次召开会议时，虽然都注意分清了出席代表与列席村干部的职权范围（列席村干部没有表决权），但多流于形式。代表会上列席村干部多（一般的多于代表一至二倍，个别地区甚至到五倍）。加之在讨论问题时，村干部发言多，代表发言少，模糊了代表会议的性质，剥夺了代表的权利，降低了代表的作用。
        （二）会议的召开，没有形成一种制度，同时对代表存有单纯的“使用”观点。会议上多是为了布置工作，分配任务，六次会议就有四次是布置秋征，一般是从政策原则的讨论，一直到把公粮数字分配到村，减免到户，并作出回村后的具体执行计划，交给代表和村干部共同执行。对于来自人民群众的许多重要提案则没有加以认真地讨论与适当处理。建国县今年召开的二届一次会议，在布置工作以后将宣布闭会时，一个代表提出质问：“我们的提案怎样了？”这时才又延长了会议，由县人民政府秘书把代表提案作了个草率的解答。也有的虽然作了处理和解决，但很少向代表作交代。因此，使代表认为参加会议是为“接受任务来的”。交河在代表会议上，向村分配征收任务时，一个代表说：“我不行，你们和村干部说吧！”由于代表会村干部会混合召开，代表们觉得在会议上“说话不顶事”。这种情况以后越来越严重。因而提案数量日益减少，代表缺席日益增多。例如：青县第一次代表会议，提案为三百五十四件，到第三次会议仅有三十九件；任邱县共有代表二百七十名，第一次缺席九名，第二次缺席十名，第三次缺席五十六名，第四次缺席一○八名，第五次经过调整重选后缺席七名，第六次又缺席十八名；河间今年二届二次人民代表会议，在二百九十名代表中，即缺席一○五名。其缺席原因，除少数人因天气不好，道路难走或有病不能参加外，最主要的还是在于会议尊重代表权利不够。代表们觉得没有权利地位，又怕接受工作任务后自己完不成，因而不愿参加会议。同时，有的会议内容多，时间短，而且报告长，讨论的时间少，不能让代表充分发表意见。正如一个代表所说的：
    “会开完了，话没有说完。”
        （三）从代表成份上看，村干部兼代表的较多，即便不是村干部，也是积极分子较多，因而形成代表的广泛性不足。根据河间五区的情形看来，三十五个代表中，只有五人不是干部。另外如交河县翻沙工人很多，但他们的工人代表仅有两名。同时某些代表的成份不纯。
        （四）关于代表产生的方式，某些县份发生形式主义和包办代替的偏向。任邱县有的代表经村干部研究指定，未经人民选举而出席代表会议；青县在一次选举代表中，一区三十二个村，经村民推出选民代表到区选举县代表，当时曾有一○四名村干部
    （非选民代表），也同样到区参加了推选表决。今年二届一次改选代表时，也是由区干部研究提出需要改选的代表名单，让群众进行改选，而不是由人民群众自己进行讨论，改选自己的代表。
        （五）常委会虽已建立，但无驻会常设机构，因而代表会闭会后，一般的缺乏与代表的经常联系。交河由开始召开各界人民代表会议到现在，并没有和代表联系过一次，影响代表作用的发挥。
        （六）一般县（镇）会前准备不足，会后具体领导也掌握得不够好，不能预先通知代表搜集准备提案。去年秋征召开代表会议，一般未能有计划地搜集整理提案，同时交代表会议讨论的草案，有的准备工作不充分，草案太长，中心不明确，致使代表难于考虑提出问题。另外，每次代表会召开时，政府往往忽视总结报告。这是不对的，政府工作、对上次决议贯彻执行情形，都要向代表作认真交代。
    由于以上问题的存在，县（镇）各界人民代表会在群众中的影响还不够深刻，同时代表在群众中的威信也不够高。
    为进一步加强人民民主政权建设，沧县专署检查了上述缺点后，提出：首先要加强各级干部对人民民主政权建设文件的学习，明确认识我们国家的政权性质和“人民代表会议或人民代表大会，是我们国家是我们政权的基本制度，是人民民主政权的最好组织形式”，定期地有计划地召开（以每年召开四次为宜），并使之形成经常的制度。其次，做好会前准备工作，深入地向群众进行民主教育，放手发动群众选好代表，加强代表性与广泛性，扩大选举的民主范围。第三，代表会议的内容应当是集中地解决当前工作和当时当地群众所迫切要求解决的一两个问题，同时适当注意解决其他各界所关心而要求解决的一定问题，并认真处理人民提案。第四，纠正代表会与干部会混淆的现象。最后，沧县专区各县土地改革已普遍完成，经过几年来的生产建设，人民生活亦有所改善，加之抗美援朝、镇压反革命两大政治运动的开展，人民群众的政治觉悟已大有提高，人民群众的民主要求亦相当迫切。目前，县人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的条件已具备，为进一步加强人民民主政权建设，于今冬可普遍代行人民代表大会的职权。（王路明、李悦农）
