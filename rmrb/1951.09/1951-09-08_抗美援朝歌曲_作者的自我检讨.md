A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

To the Editor:

\tThe "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 15th published a letter from Comrade Qu Guangzhi, in which he sternly pointed out that the lyrics of "Soong Mei-ling's Lament" and "Resist America, Aid Korea Songs" contained political errors. Both of these sets of lyrics were written by me, which shows my low level of political understanding, and I must make more efforts in this area in the future. Now, I have stopped selling my lyrics and have sent more than 200 unsold copies to the Suxian People's Cultural Center for temporary safekeeping. I hope that readers will offer more opinions on my lyrics.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    “抗美援朝歌曲”作者的自我检讨编辑同志：
    八月十五日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了曲光治同志的一封信，他严正地指出了“宋美龄自叹”和“抗美援朝歌曲”两唱词的内容有政治性的错误。这两个唱词都是我写的，这说明了我政治水平的低下，今后必须在这方面多作努力。现在，我已将我的唱词停止出售，并将未售出的唱词二百多张送交宿县人民文化馆暂为保管。我希望读者对我的唱词多提意见。
