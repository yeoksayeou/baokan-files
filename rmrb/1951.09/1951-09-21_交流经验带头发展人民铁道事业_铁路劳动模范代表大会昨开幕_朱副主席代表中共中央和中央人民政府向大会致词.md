Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The First National Railway Labor Model Representative Conference opened in the capital on the 20th. Attendees included Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government Zhu De and Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chen Shutong, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government Huang Yanpei, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Zhang Zhizhiang, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council Peng Zemin, President of the People's University of China Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League Feng Wenbin, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation Liao Chengzhi, Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Textile Workers' Union of China Chen Shaomin, and other 708 people. Among them, there were 467 labor model representatives, including model soldiers from the railway volunteer teams on the Korean front, production models from various departments of the national railways, Soviet model workers from the China Changchun Railway, heroes of the construction of new lines such as the Tianshui-Lanzhou, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Laiyuan-Zhenchuan Railways, model public security personnel who protect railway safety, and model political workers and trade union workers in the railways.

    In his opening speech, Railway Minister Teng Daiyuan summarized the great achievements of the people's railway construction, pointing out that these achievements are inseparable from the efforts of all railway workers, especially the labor models present at the meeting. He said that last year, a total of 20,000 employees in the railway system became labor models, and more than 85% of the railway employees and commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps who volunteered to participate in the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea were awarded for their merits. He pointed out that the purpose of this conference is to exchange experiences so that various tasks on the railways can be done better in the future. He said: "I hope that all labor models will not be satisfied with their existing work achievements, but will continue to improve, add merit to merit, and always maintain the title of labor model. At the same time, in our work, we must play the 'leading role, backbone role, and bridge role' as Chairman Mao said. We must teach others what we have learned, and from one labor model, produce thousands of labor models."

    Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, saying: "Under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the joint efforts of all railway employees, the railway construction of New China has made great progress. Many lines have been completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. Both last year and the first half of this year, the state transportation tasks were completed ahead of schedule. This has played a great role in promoting the national economy, connecting urban and rural areas, especially in completing the emergency repair and transportation tasks in military transportation, and consolidating national defense construction." He hoped that all railway workers and the people of the whole country would unswervingly strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, continue to work hard to run the people's railways well, further strengthen the patriotic production competition on the existing basis, implement the economic accounting system, better complete the transportation tasks assigned by the state and the construction tasks of new lines, and strive to build a strong national defense force and economic strength!

    Then, the representatives of the conference solemnly presented flags and words to Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

    Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi, Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government Zhang Bojun, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League Feng Wenbin, and Chairman of the Textile Industry Union of China Chen Shaomin spoke successively. They unanimously praised the great achievements of the people's railways in the past two years, pointing out that the victory of the railway workers is the victory of the people of the whole country, and it is also the victory of defending world peace.

    Li Yonglu, chairman of the Beijing District Trade Union of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, delivered a reply on behalf of all labor models. In his speech, he pledged, "We will definitely contribute our experience, and at the same time, we will carefully learn from other people's experiences and methods, and we will definitely implement the spirit of the conference into the actual actions of the broad masses of employees. We will never be arrogant, and we will never slack off!"
