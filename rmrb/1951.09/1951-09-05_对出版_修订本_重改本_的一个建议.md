    A Suggestion Regarding the Publication of "Revised Editions" and "Re-edited Editions"

    To the Editor:

    Currently, published books often have "revised editions" or "re-edited editions." For example, "A History of the New Democratic Revolution in China" (first draft) and "Readings on the Chinese Revolution" both have revised editions, and "Historical Materialism – Lectures on the History of Social Development" has a "re-edited edition." As for "Historical Materialism – Lecture Outline on the History of Social Development," it has been revised several times. This situation makes me very distressed: to buy a new copy would be too wasteful of money, especially since it might continue to be revised, making it impossible to buy every time; not to buy a new copy, I fear making mistakes in my studies. Of course, I am not saying that revised editions should not be published; if errors are found in the original book, they should be revised. This is the author's way of being responsible to the reader. However, publishers must take into account the burden on readers. Here, I would like to make a suggestion to the publishing houses: after revising a book, publish a separate "Correction Sheet" and give it to those who have already bought the original version, allowing readers to make the corrections themselves. This method can not only reduce the burden on readers, but also save their energy.

### 对出版“修订本”“重改本”的一个建议

专栏：读者来信

    对出版“修订本”“重改本”的一个建议编辑同志：
    现在出版的书籍，往往有“修订本”“重改本”，例如“中国新民主主义革命史”（初稿），“中国革命读本”都出了修订本，“历史唯物论——社会发展史讲义”出了“重改本”，至于“历史唯物论——社会发展史讲授提纲”更出了好几次订正本。这种情形使我感到很苦恼：重买一本吧，太浪费钱，况且还可能继续修订下去，势必无法每次都买；不重买吧，又怕学习中发生错误。当然，我不是说修订本不该出，原书发现了错误，是应该加以修订的。这是著者对读者负责的表示。但出版家必须照顾读者的负担。这里，我向出版机关提出一个建议：在修订一本书之后，另外刊印一个“改正表”，赠给已买原版本的人，由读者自行改正。这个办法不但可以减轻读者的负担，并且也可以节省读者的精力。  陈如平
