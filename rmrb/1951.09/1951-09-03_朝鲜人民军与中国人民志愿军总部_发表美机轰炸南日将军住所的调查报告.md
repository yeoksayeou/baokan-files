Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 2nd: Following the intrusion of UN military aircraft into the Kaesong neutral zone on the night of August 22nd, targeting the Korean-Chinese delegation for bombing and strafing, they once again conducted a murderous bombing of the residence of our chief delegate, General Nam Il, on September 1st. After this serious provocative act occurred, our delegation's liaison officer immediately notified the other side to conduct an on-site investigation together. The headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers issued the full text of the investigation report submitted by our delegation's chief delegate, General Nam Il, to Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai on September 2nd as follows:

    "At 00:30 on September 1st, UN military aircraft illegally intruded into the airspace of the neutral zone and carried out bombing, dropping two bombs approximately 600 meters from my residence. After the bombing incident, UN military aircraft continued to intrude into the airspace of the neutral zone, circling for reconnaissance until 05:15, intruding a total of eight times, specifically: once at 01:35, once at 01:50, once at 02:05, once at 02:10, once at 02:55, once at 03:00, once at 03:10, and once at 05:15.

    (1) At 05:45, we notified the other side by radio telephone to immediately send a liaison officer to conduct a joint investigation. The other side initially claimed that they would provide a reply to us at 06:30. However, at that time, they claimed that they could not find Colonel Kenney and could not provide a reply. After our repeated urgings, the other side finally agreed to meet with our liaison officer at Panmunjom at 09:00 to conduct an investigation. Our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, met with the other side's liaison officers, Colonel Kenney and Colonel Murray, and after preliminary talks, went to the incident site, the Bingku-dong area, and began the investigation at 10:40.

        (2) The liaison officers from both sides first inspected the two bomb craters and the traces of aircraft bombing in the vicinity, finding that the diameters of the two craters were approximately 5 meters each. The shrapnel was approximately 2 centimeters thick, and most of the crops within 10 meters around the craters were destroyed. Trees and rocks on the hillside were penetrated by shrapnel. When the inspection of the first bomb crater had just begun, Colonel Kenney immediately stated rashly that the results of the explosion of buried explosives were the same as the effect of aircraft bombing. Our liaison officer pointed out that the shape of the crater and the presence of shrapnel all over the ground were clearly the result of aircraft bombing, and questioned Colonel Kenney: How could the fragments produced by buried explosives penetrate tree trunks? Colonel Kenney avoided answering directly. After repeated questioning by our liaison officer, he then claimed that the fragments may have been caused by artillery fire. Colonel Kenney also pretended not to know the new residence of our delegation after the UN military aircraft bombing and strafing on August 22nd, and inferred that "Since we do not know the new residence of your delegation, and only your personnel know the new residence of your delegation, and since you say that the target of the bombing was your delegation's residence, therefore, if the bombs were dropped from an aircraft, it must be your aircraft." Shortly after, Colonel Kenney then proposed that the two bomb craters and the residence of our chief delegate did not form a straight line, attempting to prove that the target of the bombing was not the residence of our delegation. Our liaison officer pointed out that the other side should not bomb any location within the neutral zone at all, and the fact that the other side's aircraft frequently reconnoiter in the airspace of the neutral zone provides sufficient reason to believe that although the other side may not know which room our delegation's chief delegate lives in, they must know the residence of our chief delegate. At that time, a UN military aircraft flew over the neutral zone, and our liaison officer immediately questioned the other side. The other side could not quibble and simply laughed it off. Before leaving the crater, personnel from the other side, with the consent of our liaison officer, selected and took several pieces of shrapnel.

    (3) After inspecting the bomb craters, Kenney requested to begin questioning local residents. All the local residents who were questioned unanimously stated that they had heard the sound of aircraft bombing. Their answers fully confirmed that the aircraft that dropped the bombs was a UN military aircraft. Colonel Kenney first questioned Liu Yansun, an elderly man carrying a child on his back, on the road. Liu Yansun said in his reply that he was awakened in the middle of the night by two explosions and heard the sound of aircraft circling. He also said that since the Kaesong negotiation conference began, aircraft have frequently flown over Kaesong. The second witness, Cao Taifu, also said that he had heard two explosions and the sound of aircraft, and recognized them as American aircraft. One side of Cao Taifu's doors and windows was also destroyed by bomb fragments. Colonel Murray then questioned the third witness, Li Jingchun. Li said that he had heard explosions and the sound of aircraft, as well as the sound of the aircraft flying south after the bombing. Li also pointed out that American aircraft frequently crossed the neutral zone. The fourth witness, Li Heji, also said that she had heard explosions and the sound of aircraft. After questioning the witnesses, Colonel Kenney requested a recess of one hour, and at 13:30 the liaison officers from both sides held another meeting.

        (4) During the afternoon meeting, although Colonel Kenney had to admit that the craters were the result of large bombs and that the fragments were part of the bombs, he claimed that "based on incomplete and insufficient evidence, it appeared that there were aircraft near this area at the time of the explosion." He then used the tricks commonly used by the UN forces, claiming so-called radar reports, also discovered an "unidentified" aircraft at the location and time of the attack. Colonel Kenney also repeated the absurd argument that had already gone bankrupt in the morning, nonsense that since our personnel were the only ones who knew the location of our delegation's residence, they must also be the ones who carried out the bombing. Colonel Kenney arbitrarily stated: "No personnel of the United Nations Command have any connection with this explosion." Our liaison officer immediately denounced the other side's absurd, unfounded, and contradictory arguments. The fact that UN military aircraft constantly intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone on the night of September 1st and before dawn is sufficient to prove that the so-called "unidentified" aircraft was actually a UN aircraft. The fact that UN military aircraft frequently reconnoitered in the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone proves that the UN side fully knew the location of our delegation's residence and was determined to murder our delegation personnel. Our liaison officer pointed out that the physical evidence and witnesses in the joint investigation clearly and unequivocally pointed out that the aircraft that bombed the residence of our chief delegate at 00:30 on September 1st was indeed a UN military aircraft. Finally, our liaison officer lodged a serious verbal protest with the other side regarding the serious incident of another violation of the neutral zone agreement, declared the reservation of all rights to demand, and declared that we would keep all the evidence in its original state, and the other side could come to conduct an investigation at any time if requested."

    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军总部
    发表美机轰炸南日将军住所的调查报告
    【新华社平壤二日电】联合国军军用飞机，继八月二十二日夜侵入开城中立区上空以朝中代表团为目标，施行轰炸与扫射之后，复于九月一日再度对我首席代表南日将军住所作谋杀性的轰炸。在这一严重的挑衅行为发生以后，我方代表团联络官当即通知对方共同进行实地调查。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军总部，在九月二日发表我方代表团首席代表南日将军送呈金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员的调查报告全文如下：
    “九月一日零时三十分联合国军军用飞机，非法侵入中立区上空施行轰炸，在我住所附近距离约六百公尺处投弹二枚。在轰炸事件发生以后，联合国军军用飞机仍不断侵入中立区上空，盘旋侦察至五时一刻止，共侵入八次之多，计：一时三十五分一次，一时五十分一次，二时零五分一次，二时十分一次，二时五十五分一次，三时一次，三时十分一次，五时十五分一次。
    （一）我方于五时四十五分用无线电话通知对方，立刻派联络官前来共同进行调查。对方首先声称：在六时三十分给予我方回答。但届时却又声称：无法找到肯尼上校，不能给予答复。经我方三次催促之后，对方在八时方始约定在九时前来板门店与我方联络官会晤，并进行调查。我方联络官张春山上校、柴成文中校与对方联络官肯尼上校、穆莱上校会晤以后，经过初步的会谈，即赴出事地点冰库洞地区，十时四十分开始实行调查。
        （二）双方联络官首先检查两个弹坑及其附近飞机轰炸的痕迹，发现两弹坑直径各约五公尺。弹片厚约二公分，弹坑周围十公尺内的农作物大部摧毁，山坡上的树木与石块有被弹片炸穿者。在刚刚开始视察第一个弹坑时，肯尼上校立即率尔声称：埋在地下的爆炸物的爆炸结果与飞机投弹的效果相同。我方联络官指出弹坑的形状以及满地弹片的情况，显然是飞机投弹的结果，并向肯尼上校质问：何以埋在地下的爆炸物，所产生的碎片竟能洞穿树干。肯尼上校避而不作正面答复。经我方联络官再三追问后，则又声称，碎片的产生可能是由于大炮轰射所致。肯尼上校又佯以不知我方代表团在八月二十二日联合国军军用飞机轰炸扫射后新的住所，而推论称：“既然我们不知道你方代表团的新住所，而只有你方人员才知道你方代表团的新住所，既然你们说轰炸的目标是你方代表团的住所，因此，如果炸弹是从飞机上投掷下来的，那就一定是你方的飞机。”而事后不久，肯尼上校却又提出两个弹坑与我首席代表的住所并不形成一根直线，企图证明轰炸的目标，并非我方代表团的住所。我方联络官指出对方根本就不应该轰炸中立区内的任何地点，而对方飞机经常在中立区上空侦察，更有充分理由可以相信对方虽然不一定知道我方代表团首席代表住在那一间房间，却一定知道我方首席代表的住所。当时适有联合国军军用飞机一架，飞越中立区上空，我方联络官当即向对方质问。对方无以狡赖，竟以一笑置之。在离开弹坑之前，对方人员在取得我方联络官同意后，选择取去碎片若干片。
    （三）双方联络官在检查弹坑后，肯尼即要求开始询问当地居民。所有询问到的当地居民，都一致声称曾听见飞机轰炸声。他们的答话充分证实投弹的飞机即是联合国军军用飞机。肯尼上校在路上首先向一背着小孩的老者柳彦孙问话。柳彦孙在答话中称，在半夜中为爆炸声两响所惊醒，并听见飞机盘旋声。并称：自从开城谈判会议开始后，经常有飞机在开城上空飞行。第二个证人曹泰福亦称，曾听见爆炸声两响及飞机声，并认出是美国飞机。曹泰福屋内门窗一边并为炸弹碎片所击毁。穆莱上校又向第三个证人李景春询问，李称曾听见爆炸声与飞机声，以及飞机在轰炸后向南飞去的声音。李又指出美国飞机经常越过中立区。第四个证人李鹤姬亦称曾听见爆炸声与飞机声。询问人证后，肯尼上校要求休会一小时，在一时三十分双方联络官再进行会谈。
        （四）下午会谈中，肯尼上校虽然不得不承认弹坑是大型炸弹的结果，碎片也是炸弹的一部分，但又声称“根据不完全充分的证据，在爆炸时似乎是有飞机在这区域附近”。继又使用了联合国军方面所惯用的伎俩，声称所谓雷达报告，又正好在攻击发生的位置和时间，发现一架“未经辨别”的飞机。肯尼上校更重复上午已经破产的荒谬论调，胡说我方人员既是唯一知道我方代表团住所位置的，因此，也必然是施行轰袭者。肯尼上校并武断的声称：“联合国军的任何人员，都与这次爆炸无任何关系。”我方联络官当即痛斥对方的荒谬无稽、自相矛盾的论点。联合国军的军用飞机，在九月一日的夜间与黎明以前，不断地侵入开城中立区之内的事实，就完全足以证明所谓“未经辨别”的飞机，实际上就是联合国军的飞机，联合国军军用飞机经常在开城中立区的上空侦察的事实，证明了联合国军方面完全知道我方代表团住所的位置，并蓄意谋害我方代表团人员的决心。我方联络官指出双方调查中的物证和人证，都充分明确地指出九月一日零时三十分轰炸我首席代表住所的飞机，确是联合国军的军用飞机。最后我方联络官对于对方又一次破坏中立区协议的严重事件，口头向对方提出严重抗议，声明保留一切要求的权利，并声明我方将把一切证据保持原状，对方在任何时间要求进行调查时，均可前来。”
