Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 16th: North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong issued a statement on the 15th, opposing the separate peace treaty with Japan signed on September 8th in San Francisco by the United States and its vassal states, and lodging a firm protest. The statement pointed out: The purpose of this illegal so-called peace treaty is to use the power of Japanese militarism to suppress the national liberation movement in Asia and attack the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Precisely for this reason, the United States government deliberately violated well-known international agreements, excluding the two major powers – the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China – which played a decisive role in the struggle to destroy militarist Japan, had long suffered Japanese aggression, and had the most direct interest in Japan's demilitarization and democratization, from the preparation and conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. However, anyone with a little rationality will clearly understand that a genuine peace with Japan cannot be guaranteed without the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which are the most important factors in maintaining peace in Asia.

The statement emphasized: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly issued statements pointing out that Japan's material and human resources have served the United States from the very first day that American interventionists invaded Korea. Now that the American imperialists have concluded a separate peace treaty with Japan, it is clear that they are attempting to openly utilize Japan in order to conquer Korea. The evil conspiracy of the United States and Japanese imperialists against Korea has aroused great anger among our people and peace-loving people all over the world who want to resolutely crush the aggressors' plots.

The statement also said: The "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" concluded at the same time as the aforementioned treaty is to strengthen U.S. rule over Japan. Its sole purpose is to establish U.S. air and naval bases and enslave the people of Asia. This agreement between the U.S. and Japan was concluded primarily to seize Korea, which they regard as an outpost for attacking China.

The statement said: In order to maintain international tension and continue its aggression, the United States perfidiously violated the obligations it itself should fulfill when making peace with Japan in accordance with various relevant international agreements. It is particularly obvious that the United States has refused to stipulate in the treaty the return of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and other Chinese territories occupied by it to their legitimate owner—the People's Republic of China. Undoubtedly, this "peace treaty" and "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" have nothing in common with the various tasks of a genuine peace that are of direct concern to the people of Asia (including the Japanese people).

The statement concluded: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea completely adopts the same position as the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China on this issue, and believes that the San Francisco trick is a treaty for preparing for war rather than for peace. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representing the will of the entire Korean people, hereby declares that the peace treaty with Japan concluded in San Francisco is illegal and invalid, and therefore cannot be recognized.

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永发表声明
    坚决反对美国签订单独对日和约
    美国利用日本侵朝罪行激起朝鲜人民极大愤怒
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永于十五日发表声明，反对九月八日由美国及其仆从国家在旧金山签订的单独对日和约，并提出坚决的抗议。声明指出：这个非法的所谓和约，其目的在于利用日本军国主义的力量镇压亚洲的民族解放运动、进攻苏联与中华人民共和国。正因为如此，美国政府故意违反众所周知的国际协定，在准备和缔结对日和约时，把在击灭军国主义日本的斗争中起了决定性作用、并曾长期遭受日本侵略、和日本的非军国主义化与民主化最有切身利害关系的两大强国——苏联和中华人民共和国排斥在外。但是，稍有理性的人也会清楚地知道：真正的对日媾和，如果没有作为维护亚洲和平的最重要因素的苏联和中华人民共和国参加，是不可能得到保障的。
    声明强调指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾屡次发表声明，指出日本的物力、人力从美国干涉者侵犯朝鲜的头一天起，就为美国服务了。现在美帝国主义者缔结了单独对日和约，显然是为了征服朝鲜而企图公开利用日本。美国和日本帝国主义分子反对朝鲜的罪恶阴谋，激起了我们人民和要坚决粉碎侵略者的诡计的全世界爱好和平人民的极大愤怒。
    声明又说：和上述条约同时缔结的“美日安全条约”，是为了加强美国对日本的统治。它的唯一目的是要建立美国的海空军基地，奴役亚洲人民。美日之间的这一协定，首先是为了侵占被它们看作进攻中国的前哨基地的朝鲜而缔结的。
    声明说：美国为了保持国际间的紧张空气，继续进行侵略，背信地违反了根据各种有关的国际协定来与日本媾和时它自己所应该履行的义务。特别明显的是：美国竟拒绝在和约中规定把为它所侵占的台湾、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛及其他中国领土归还给其合法的主人——中华人民共和国。无疑地，这种“和约”及“美日安全条约”是与跟亚洲人民（包括日本人民）有切身利害关系的真正媾和的各种任务，没有任何共同之处的。
    声明最后说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对这一问题，完全采取和苏联政府与中华人民共和国政府同样的立场，认定旧金山的诡计不是为了和平而是为了准备战争的条约。代表全朝鲜人民意志的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府兹特声明：由于在旧金山缔结的对日和约是非法的、无效的，因此不能加以承认。
