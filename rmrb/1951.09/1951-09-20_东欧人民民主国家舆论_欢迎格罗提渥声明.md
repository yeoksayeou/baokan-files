    Public Opinion in Eastern European People's Democracies
    Welcomes Grotewohl Declaration
    [Xinhua News Agency, September 19th] The declaration by Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, proposing all-German free elections and the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the resolution adopted by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on the above proposal, have been warmly welcomed by public opinion in the Eastern European People's Democracies. Newspapers and radio broadcasts in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria have all given Grotewohl's statement and the People's Chamber's resolution prominent coverage.
    All major newspapers in Czechoslovakia emphasized in their headlines that the purpose of the new initiative by the government and parliament of the German Democratic Republic is to seek a peaceful resolution to the German question and to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. The newspapers pointed out that the German people resolutely oppose the plan to drag West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty.
    The Polish "Free Tribune" published an editorial stating: The decisions of the Washington conference of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France clearly demonstrate that the imperialists have already assigned the German people the role of cannon fodder in their aggressive plans. The proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic provides those who advocate the establishment of a unified, peace-loving Germany with new weapons of struggle. The Polish people, who eagerly hope to prevent the revival of German militarism, firmly support the German people's call for peace.
    An editorial in the Romanian "Universal Newspaper" pointed out: The German Democratic Republic has put forward valuable proposals of great political and moral significance to the leaders of West Germany. Only the enemies of the German people will oppose this concrete and sincere proposal. The editorial said: Only by restoring German unity on a peaceful basis can it be spared new disasters. It is precisely for this reason that the People's Chamber's letter to the German people has gained the warm sympathy of the Romanian people and the people of other countries.
    The Bulgarian "Labor Daily" published an article entitled "The German People Do Not Want to Turn Germany into a Suicidal Country," commenting that the primary condition for avoiding another European and global war is the unification of Germany on a basis of peace and democracy. The "Workers' Cause" commented that the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on the peaceful resolution of the German question is a great contribution to the common struggle of all mankind to strive for peace and oppose the conspiracy of the arsonists of a new war.

    波兰“自由论坛报”发表社论说：美英法三外长华盛顿会议的决定清楚地表明，帝国主义者在自己的侵略计划里已经给德国人民安排下了当炮灰的角色。德意志民主共和国人民议会的建议使主张建立统一的爱好和平的德国的人们获得新的斗争武器。切望制止德国军国主义复活的波兰人民坚决支持德国人民这一保障和平的呼声。
    罗马尼亚“宇宙报”社论指出：德意志民主共和国向西德领袖们提出了具有伟大政治意义和道义意义的宝贵建议。这个具体而诚恳的建议只有德国人民的敌人才会反对。社论说：只有在和平基础上恢复德国的统一，才能使它免受新的灾难，正因为这样，人民议会的告德国人民书获得了罗马尼亚人民以及其他国家人民的热烈同情。
