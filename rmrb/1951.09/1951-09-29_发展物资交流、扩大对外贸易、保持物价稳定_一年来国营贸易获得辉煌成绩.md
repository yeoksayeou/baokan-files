    Developing Material Exchange, Expanding Foreign Trade, Maintaining Price Stability
    Remarkable Achievements of State-Owned Trade in the Past Year
    In 1951, under the new tasks of opposing imperialist aggression and smashing imperialist blockade, the guiding principle for state-owned trade was determined as follows: to develop material exchange between urban and rural areas, to expand trade with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, and to continue to maintain national price stability. Over the past year, thanks to the implementation of this guiding principle and policy by governments at all levels, China's trade work has achieved remarkable results.
    Since last autumn, under the vigorous advocacy of the people's governments at all levels for the promotion of local products, various economic departments have cooperated in carrying out a series of organizational tasks, encouraging private merchants to engage in the management of local products, and launching a nationwide large-scale exchange of local products, opening up sales channels for most local products nationwide. Up to now, 80 percent of local products have been sold. Many local products that were previously exported to capitalist countries—such as raw silk from East China, almost 90 percent of which was sold to capitalist countries before liberation; and silks and satins, which were all exported to capitalist countries in the past—have now found sales channels in domestic sales and exports to the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. Many slow-moving or unsalable cold and unpopular goods have also found sales channels.
    Due to the extensive development of the large-scale local product promotion movement, urban and rural exchanges have been greatly enlivened, and people's purchasing power has been increased. People's purchasing power has generally increased by about 30 percent over the past year. In the Southwest region, farmers' purchasing power has increased by 60 percent compared with before liberation; in northern Anhui, farmers' purchasing power has increased by about 100 percent. In Jilin Province, the per capita consumption of pork in rural areas increased from 8.6 jin in 1950 to 11 jin in 1951. Since this spring, large, medium, and small cities across the country have generally shown a prosperous atmosphere due to the increased purchasing power of farmers and the expansion of rural market capacity. The demand for industrial products in some cities has begun to exceed supply, reversing the previous situation of sluggish sales; many factories have restored and expanded production, and private merchants have achieved great development. In Shanghai, 1,596 industrial enterprises opened in the first quarter of this year, more than three times the number opened in the fourth quarter of last year; 3,278 commercial enterprises opened, more than one-third more than the number opened last year. In Beijing, the number of industrial and commercial enterprises increased by 3,543 at the end of April compared to the beginning of the year. Comparing market turnover in the first quarter of this year with the same period last year, cotton cloth increased by 250 percent and flour increased by 59 percent. Under these circumstances, state-owned trade organizations have also rapidly developed and become widespread and penetrated into small cities and some rural market towns. In the minority areas of the Southwest, 184 trade branches and more than 100 consignment stores have been established in the past year. In the minority areas of the Northwest, 286 specialized trade organizations have also been set up to engage in the acquisition of local and special products and the supply of daily necessities. In 1951, the national acquisition of agricultural products (excluding Inner Mongolia and the Northeast) increased by approximately 128.6 percent compared with 1950; the sales of industrial products (excluding Inner Mongolia and the Northeast) increased by approximately 154 percent compared with 1950.
    Due to the rapid development of China's trade with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, a large amount of industrial equipment, chemical raw materials, and machinery equipment have been imported from the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, and a nationwide domestic trade network has been established, maintaining a normal supply to the market and industrial production; At the same time, in the acquisition of agricultural and sideline products, state-owned trade has mastered the policy of reasonable regional price differences, seasonal price differences, and wholesale and retail price differences, playing a leading role in maintaining price stability.

    发展物资交流、扩大对外贸易、保持物价稳定
    一年来国营贸易获得辉煌成绩
    一九五一年，国营贸易在反对帝国主义侵略、粉碎帝国主义封锁的新任务下，确定贸易方针是：发展城乡物资交流，扩大对苏联和新民主主义国家的贸易，继续保持全国物价稳定。一年来，由于各级人民政府对这一方针政策的贯彻执行，我国贸易工作获得了辉煌的成绩。
    自去年秋季起，在各级人民政府对土产推销运动的大力倡导下，各经济部门相互配合进行了一系列组织工作，鼓励私商对土产的经营，展开了全国性的土产大交流，给全国大部分土产打开了销路。截至目前为止，已经有百分之八十的土产品推销出去。过去许多向资本主义国家出口的土产——如华东的生丝，解放前几乎百分之九十是销到资本主义国家的；绸缎过去也是全部对资本主义国家输出的，现在都已经在内销和对苏联及新民主主义国家出口中找到了销路。许多滞销的或销不出去的冷、背货，现在也找到了销路。
    由于大规模土产推销运动广泛展开，大大活跃了城乡交流，提高了人民购买力。一年来人民购买力普遍提高了百分之三十左右。西南区农民购买力比解放前提高了百分之六十；皖北农民购买力则提高了一倍左右；吉林省农村猪肉消费量一九五○年平均每人八斤六两，一九五一年增加到十一斤。今春以来，全国大、中、小城市，由于农民购买力的提高，农村市场容量的扩大，均普遍呈现着欣欣向荣的气象。有些城市工业品已由过去滞销而开始供不应求；许多工厂恢复与扩大了生产，私商得到很大发展。上海市今年第一季开业的工业一五九六家，超过去年第四季度开业的三倍多；开业的商业户三二七八家，超过去年开业的三分之一以上。北京市工商业户四月底较年初增加了三五四三家。市场成交量以今年第一季与去年同时期比较，棉布增加百分之二五○，面粉增加百分之五九。在这种情况下，国营贸易机构亦获得了迅速的发展并普及和深入到小城市和部分农村集镇。西南少数民族地区一年来就已设立了一八四个贸易分支机构和一百多个代销店。西北少数民族地区也设置了二八六个贸易专业机构，以从事于当地土、特产的收购和日用必需品的供应。一九五一年全国农产品的收购（不包括内蒙、东北），约较一九五○年增加百分之一二八点六；工业品的销售（不包括内蒙、东北）约较一九五○年增加百分之一五四。
    由于我国对苏联和新民主主义国家贸易的急剧发展，大量的工业器材、化工原料及机器设备，由苏联及新民主主义国家输入，和国内贸易网的普遍建立，保持了对市场及工业生产的正常供应；同时在收购农副产品方面，国营贸易掌握了合理的地区差价、季节差价和零批差价的政策，在保持物价稳定中起着领导作用。
