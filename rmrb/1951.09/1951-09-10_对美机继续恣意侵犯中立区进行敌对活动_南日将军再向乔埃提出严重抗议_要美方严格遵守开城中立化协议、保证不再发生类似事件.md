Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 9th: General Nam Il lodged another strong protest with Joye regarding the continued violation of the Kaesong neutral zone by US aircraft, the full text is as follows: To Vice Admiral Joye, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

    Since the Kaesong area was neutralized, your military aircraft have continuously violated the agreement by entering the airspace of the neutral zone. Since August 13th, I have continuously lodged oral and written protests with you, but your side has consistently refused to handle these brazen violations of the agreement with a serious and responsible attitude. Your military aircraft continue to intrude into the airspace of the neutral zone with impunity. Since one of your military aircraft dropped bombs in the neutral zone at 00:30 on September 1st, up to September 8th, your military aircraft have intruded into the airspace of the neutral zone to conduct patrols, reconnaissance, and other hostile actions as many as 139 times, specifically: 18 sorties on September 1st, 18 sorties on September 2nd, 23 sorties on September 3rd, 13 sorties on September 4th,1 3 sorties on September 5th, 2 sorties on September 6th, 28 sorties on September 7th, and 24 sorties on September 8th. I once again lodge a strong protest with you regarding the violation of the Kaesong neutralization agreement by your military aircraft, which continuously intrude into the neutral zone and wantonly conduct hostile activities, and I demand that your side strictly abide by the Kaesong neutralization agreement and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.

    General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers
