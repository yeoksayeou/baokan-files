Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill fine yarn operator
Meng Shuyuan constantly improves working methods to reduce roller lapping rate

Meng Shuyuan, a fine yarn operator at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill, has become an advanced producer in Tianjin due to her diligent study of technology and continuous improvement of working methods to reduce the roller lapping rate. Meng Shuyuan operates 500 spindles spinning 21-count warp yarn. Her average roller lapping rate for February, March, April, May, and August this year was only 0.234%, more than half lower than the average roller lapping rate of the entire workshop during the same period.

After the factory leadership discovered Meng Shuyuan's achievement, they organized a Meng Shuyuan work method measurement team in August to conduct on-site measurements. The measurement results revealed three advantages to Meng Shuyuan's working methods: First, she rationally uses her labor power in her work, concentrating her energy on finding and rejoining broken ends, and using the gaps between broken ends to carry out various cleaning tasks. When twisting the rollers, she checks for broken ends after twisting each board (six spindles), and after twisting two or three boards, she pauses temporarily to patrol. When spinning semi-large yarn, the "life" is easy, so she does more cleaning work; when spinning semi-small yarn, there are more broken ends, so she does less cleaning work. After doffing, it is easiest to accumulate lint when the machine starts, so she concentrates on joining the ends, putting other work aside. Her patrol route is mainly in the 400-spindle alley. When patrolling to the 100-spindle alley, she first checks for broken ends, and if there are none, she does not enter the alley. She patrols the large alley about four times, and the small alley only once. This allows her to promptly discover broken ends and shorten the lint accumulation time after a break. Second, she combines several actions to perform them simultaneously, which saves time and reduces walking. For example, when changing roving, she uses her left hand to remove the bobbin and place it on the machine board, while simultaneously using her right hand to thread the roving. This way, both hands work simultaneously, and it takes an average of only ten seconds to change one roving. For example, when sweeping the alley, she pushes the small cart forward with her left hand, scrubs the board with her right hand, and joins the broken ends at the same time. If there is more than one broken end, she joins them from right to left. This way, just as her right hand is about to finish joining, her left hand has already pulled up another yarn, greatly saving time. Third, she frequently pays attention to the operating status of the machine in her work, and then grasps its operating rules, while also paying attention to improving working conditions. If she encounters a certain spindle continuously breaking, she removes the top roller cradle to look for problems, or checks whether the roller is broken. If she can solve the problem herself, she does so immediately, otherwise she immediately finds the worker who checks empty spindles to repair it. Earlier this month, representatives from various cotton mills in Tianjin returned to Tianjin after studying the Hao Jianxiu work method in Qingdao, and then visited Meng Shuyuan's work method at the No. 1 Cotton Mill. The representatives believed that the basic characteristics of Meng Shuyuan's work method were generally consistent with the Hao Jianxiu work method. Although Meng Shuyuan's operation was not as skilled as Hao Jianxiu's, the roving end wrapping still had lumps, the patrol routine was still occasionally disrupted by joining ends, and the predictability of the work was not yet sufficient; however, the representatives believed that Meng Shuyuan's unique features were that she could scrub the board with both hands, and one patrol could clean both sides of the machine; and that she carried a cleaning tool for roller lapping – a small pick – with her during the patrol. After joining the broken ends at the end of the machine, she immediately twisted the roller on the spot at the end of the machine, without having to return to the head of the machine, thus shortening the patrol route.

The North China Textile Administration has now decided to focus on promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, while also promoting the advantages of Meng Shuyuan's work method in its affiliated factories.

### 天津第一棉纺织厂细纱值车工  孟淑媛不断改进工作方法减低皮辊花率

    天津第一棉纺织厂细纱值车工
    孟淑媛不断改进工作方法减低皮辊花率
    国营天津第一棉纺织厂细纱值车工孟淑媛因努力钻研技术，不断改进工作方法，减低皮辊花率，已成为天津市的先进生产者。孟淑媛看纺二十一支经纱的锭子五百个，今年二、三、四、五、八五个月的皮辊花率平均只有百分之零点二三四，比全车间同期平均皮辊花率要低一半以上。
    该厂领导方面发现孟淑媛这一成绩后，于八月份组织了一个孟淑媛工作法测定小组，到现场进行测定。测定结果，发现孟淑媛的工作方法有三个优点：第一，她在工作中合理使用自己的劳动力，集中精力发现断头与接好断头，并利用没有断头的空隙进行各项清洁工作。她捻皮辊时，每捻完一块板
    （六个锭子）就要看看有没有断头，捻完两块或三块板时，便暂时停止下来去巡回一次。在半大纱的时候，“生活”好做，她就多做清洁工作；半小纱的时候，断头比较多，就少做清洁工作。落纱后刚一开车最易开花，她便集中力量去接头，把其他工作放一下。她的巡回行径主要是在四百锭弄当，巡回到一百锭弄当时要先看看有没有断头，如果没有就不进弄当，大约大弄当巡回四次，小弄当才巡回一次。这样就能够及时发现断头和缩短断头后的开花时间。第二，她把几种动作合并起来同时进行，既节省时间，又少走路。例如换粗纱时，她就是用左手取下木管往车板放，同时右手穿上粗纱，这样两只手同时动作，平均每换一只粗纱只耗时十秒。再如扫除弄当时，她左手推着小推子前进，右手打擦板，同时接断头，遇有断头一个以上时，她从右向左来接，这样右手刚要接齐，左手早已将另外一个纱拔起，大大节省了时间。第三，她在工作中经常注意车子运转状况，进而掌握它的运转规律，同时注意改善工作情况。如碰见某一锭子连续断头，她就卸下上皮圈架，找找毛病，或者看看皮辊是否坏了，自己能解决的马上解决，否则就即时找查空锭的工人来修理。本月初，天津各棉纺织厂到青岛学习郝建秀工作法的代表返回天津后，又到第一棉纺织厂参观了孟淑媛的工作法，代表们认为孟淑媛工作法的基本特点与郝建秀工作法大体一致，虽然孟淑媛的操作不如郝建秀熟练，接粗纱包头还有疙疸，巡回规律还间或被接头打乱，工作上的预见性还不很够；但代表们认为孟淑媛的独到之处，一个是她能双手打擦板，一次巡回就能作好两面车的清洁工作；一个是她巡回时随身带着皮辊花的清洁工具——小扦子，于车尾断头接齐后，即就地在车尾捻皮辊，无需再返回车头，因而缩短了巡回行径。
    现华北纺织管理局决定以推广郝建秀工作法为主，同时在所属各厂推广孟淑媛工作法中的优点。
