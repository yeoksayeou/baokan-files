    Displaying Portraits of Leaders Requires a Serious Attitude
    To the Editor:
    On the wall at the intersection of Datong Road and Fushou Street in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, there is a huge portrait of Chairman Mao and Stalin (about two people tall), but it is painted very crudely and completely fails to express the great spirit of our people's leaders. However, a certain photo studio in Xinxiang, Pingyuan Province, puts Commander-in-Chief Zhu De together with some frivolous and vulgar photos. Similar phenomena also exist in shops or homes in other places. This is an unserious and disrespectful manifestation towards our people's leaders. I suggest that our organizations, groups, shops, or families adopt a serious attitude when displaying portraits of leaders.

    张挂领袖像要采取严肃态度编辑同志：
    在河南省郑州市大同路和福寿街十字路口的墙壁上，画着一巨幅毛主席和斯大林像（有两人高），但画得非常粗糙，完全不能表达出人民领袖的伟大气魄。而平原省新乡市某照像馆，却把朱总司令和一些内容轻佻庸俗的照片摆在一起。在其他地方的店铺或家庭中，也有类似的现象。这是对我们人民领袖不严肃、不尊敬的表现。我建议我们的机关、团体、店铺或家庭在张挂领袖像时要采取严肃的态度。
