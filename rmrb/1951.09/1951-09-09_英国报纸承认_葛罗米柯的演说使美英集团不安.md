    British Newspapers Admit
    Gromyko's Speech Makes the US-UK Bloc Uneasy
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 8th] British newspapers admit that Soviet delegation leader Gromyko's speech at the San Francisco conference on the 5th made the US-UK bloc feel uneasy. According to a report by the Telepress London on the 7th: "The Daily Express" said: Western representatives "seem to feel uneasy, they believe that Gromyko may have given the impression to the Far East, especially India, Burma, China, and even Japan, that this is a signing conference, and that their interests have not been taken into account at all."
    The "Manchester Guardian's" Tokyo correspondent commented on the impact of Gromyko's speech in Japan, saying: "Independent observers believe that the Soviet proposals have considerable influence in a section of Japanese public opinion," because these proposals "will guarantee the complete liberation of Japanese territory and enable Japan to avoid spending a lot of money to maintain American bases." The correspondent wrote: "The Japanese fear that alliance with the United States will eventually bring war to Japan."

    英国报纸承认
    葛罗米柯的演说使美英集团不安
    【新华社八日讯】英国报纸承认苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯五日在旧金山会议上的演说使美英集团感觉不安。据电通社伦敦七日讯：“每日快报”说：西方代表们“似乎感到不安，他们认为葛罗米柯可能已使远东，特别是印度、缅甸、中国，甚至日本得到这种印象：这是一个签字画押的会议，会上丝毫没有顾及它们的利益”。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”东京记者评论葛罗米柯的演说在日本的影响时说：“独立的观察家认为苏联的建议在日本一部分舆论中有相当的影响”，因为这些建议“会保证日本领土的全部解放，能使日本避免花很多钱去维持美国基地”。该记者写道：“日本人害怕：与美国联盟，终有一天会把战争带到日本”。
