    The Glory of Marxism Illuminates the True Face of History
    ——After Reading “An Investigation into the History of Wu Xun”

    To the Editor:
    “An Investigation into the History of Wu Xun” not only solved the “Wu Xun problem,” exposing a historical fraud created by the propagandists of Wu Xun with irrefutable historical facts, but more importantly, it proved that Marxism is an indestructible revolutionary weapon, and historical materialism is the brilliant light illuminating the true face of history. It taught us the viewpoints and methods of observing and evaluating historical figures with concrete examples. From this, I learned the following two points:
    In a class society, the activities of all figures serve the class struggle. The more acute the struggle, the more prominent this becomes. No matter how complex and changeable the forms of struggle and the circumstances of the figures' activities, these social activities are, in the final analysis, deeply marked with the brand of class. Whom does it serve? Who benefits? Does it promote revolutionary struggle or hinder social development? These are the specific questions that must be asked first when evaluating historical events and figures. There can be no ambiguity, evasion, concealment, or embellishment on this point. Regardless of which class a person belongs to, the first question to ask is which class did he serve. Under the light of such materialism, the smoke and mirrors of Wu Xun’s devotion to education dissipated, and the truth about Wu Xun as a rogue and a running dog was exposed. Abstract moral concepts cannot be the starting point for studying history and judging figures; the starting point must be concrete class analysis. Failure to comply with this will lead to being trapped in the fog of history, or intentionally or unintentionally concealing the truth of history.
    To judge a person, it is not based on his own declaration, but on his behavior and the effects of his behavior. Separating motives and effects will not lead to correct conclusions. Chairman Mao has already clearly solved this problem. "Social practice is the standard for testing subjective desires, and effects are the standard for testing motives." "True kindness must take into account the effect." A well-intentioned doctor may occasionally prescribe the wrong medicine, but it is impossible to use poison to kill people "day after day for thirty years" while claiming to be "saving the world." Such "knowing the person and discussing the world" is fully in line with historical truth. The true history of Wu Xun proves that he himself was a big liar, and also proves that those who promoted him were also, to some extent, deceivers.
    In short, the truth of history is the complex struggle activities of various classes of people. We must first start with analyzing the actual situation of these concrete activities, and we must never make judgments based on certain people's subjective statements. The investigation and study of the historical facts of Wu Xun and Song Jingshi fully proves that: historical materialism is the only correct method to reveal the truth of history, and no matter how complex and ever-changing the historical facts and figures are, they cannot escape the control of the laws of historical materialism; the clearer the factual investigation, the more obvious the correctness of Marxist judgment becomes.
    From the above preliminary understanding, I have associated many historical events and figures, as well as today's struggle reality, and even myself. I think "An Investigation into the History of Wu Xun" should not just be a conclusion, but also an important beginning. It should trigger many other discussions, continue to expose many historical frauds, correct our understanding of many historical events and figures, and enable many people to learn to use Marxist-Leninist weapons to criticize their own erroneous thoughts, words and actions, and improve themselves. As for myself, I have examined my thoughts of admiring Boyi, Liu Xiahui, Tao Yuanming, and Li Bai, my thoughts of respecting asceticism, my cynical attitude, my blind advocacy of Gandhi, and my distorted understanding of Lu Xun's remarks, using ideas such as "new village," "self-cultivation," and "reading without experiencing" to anesthetize myself, cover up my fear of reality, and fear of serious revolutionary struggle, all kinds of past mistakes that I excused myself for, but today seem inexcusable. From this, I deeply feel that the wrong understanding of history is not only due to errors in ideological methods, but also has a basis in real activities. Some people investigate Wu Xun and cannot see Song Jingshi, and put the revolutionary banner of Song Jingshi on Wu Xun. This is not accidental. Only by personally engaging in the practice of revolutionary struggle is it possible to master the revolutionary historical viewpoint and historical method, and to recognize the true face of history; a correct understanding of history will inevitably affect thoughts and actions in reality. Criticizing Wu Xun cannot but involve Tao Xingzhi, and cannot but affect the judgments of other historical and real figures. Therefore, I believe that, with "An Investigation into the History of Wu Xun" setting a glorious example,展开ing discussions on many historical figures (especially those who still have a wide influence today), clarifying who should be praised, who should be opposed, which points should be praised, which points should be opposed, exposing the truth of the activities of many historical figures, and then further elaborating the rich activities of those who should be praised, is helpful to our patriotic ideological education and the current revolutionary struggle.

### 马克思主义的光辉照出了历史的真面目——读“武训历史调查记”以后

    马克思主义的光辉照出了历史的真面目
    ——读“武训历史调查记”以后编辑同志：
    “武训历史调查记”不但解决了“武训问题”，以无可争辩的历史事实揭穿了武训的宣传者所造成的一个历史骗局；而且，更重要的，它证明了马克思主义是无坚不摧的革命武器，历史唯物论是照明历史真面目的灿烂的光辉，它用具体的实例教导了观察历史和评判历史人物的观点和方法。从这里面我学习到了下面两点：
    在阶级社会中，一切人物的活动都服务于阶级斗争。斗争越尖锐，这一点就越突出。不管斗争的方式和人物活动的情形怎样复杂多变，而归根结蒂，这些社会活动都深深打上了阶级的烙印。为谁服务？对谁有利？推动了革命斗争还是阻碍了社会发展？这就是评判历史事件和历史人物时首先要问的具体问题。在这上面不能有一点含糊、躲闪、蒙蔽、修饰。不管他是那一阶级的人，第一要问他为那一阶级办了事。在这样的唯物论的光辉之下，武训的兴学苦行的烟雾就四散，武训的流氓和走狗的真相就毕露了。抽象的道德观念不能作研究历史评判人物的出发点，出发点必须是具体的阶级分析。不遵守这一条就要陷入历史的迷雾中，或有意或无意地遮掩了历史的真相。
    判断一个人，不是根据他自己的宣言，而是根据他的行为和行为的效果。把动机和效果分离来看，就得不出正确的结论。毛主席早已明确解决了这个问题。“社会实践是检验主观愿望的标准，效果是检验动机的标准。”“真正的好心，必须顾及效果。”好心的医生可能偶然开错药方，但决不可能“三十年如一日”地用毒药杀人还说自己是“济世活人”。这样的“知人论世”是完全符合历史真相的。武训的真实历史证明了他本人是个大骗子，同时也证明了为他宣传的人也或多或少有些骗人。
    总之，历史的真相就是各阶级人物的复杂的斗争活动。我们首先要从这些具体活动的实际情况着手分析，而决不能根据某些人的主观陈述来下判断。关于武训和宋景诗的活动史实的调查研究充分证明了：历史唯物论是揭露历史真相的唯一正确方法，而且无论怎样复杂万变扑朔迷离的历史事实和人物都逃不出历史唯物论的规律的支配；事实调查愈清楚，马克思主义的判断的正确性就愈显露出来。
    由以上的初步了解，我联想到许多历史事件和人物以及今天的斗争现实，乃至我自己。我以为“武训历史调查记”不应该只是一个结论，还应该是一个重要的发端。应该从此引起许多其他讨论，继续揭发许多历史骗局，端正我们对许多历史事件和人物的认识，并且使许多人能学习运用马列主义武器来批判自己的错误思想和言论行动而提高一步。就我自己说，我曾经由此检查了我的羡慕伯夷、柳下惠、陶渊明、李太白的思想，尊崇苦行的思想，玩世不恭的态度，盲目宣传甘地和歪曲了解鲁迅的言论，以“新村”“独善其身”“阅而不历”等等想法麻醉自己、掩盖逃避现实害怕严重革命斗争的心理，种种过去曾为自己开脱而今天看来是无可辩解的错误。我由此深深感到对历史的错误认识不仅是由于思想方法的错误，而且是有现实活动作根据的。有人调查武训就看不见宋景诗，就把宋景诗的革命旗帜插到武训身上。这不是偶然的。只有亲身投入革命斗争的实践才有可能掌握革命的历史观点和历史方法，认识历史的真面目；正确地认识历史也必然会影响到现实中的思想和行动。批判武训不能不牵涉到陶行知，不能不影响到对其他历史人物和现实人物的论断。因此，我以为，由“武训历史调查记”树立光辉的榜样，而展开对许多历史人物（尤其是现在还有广泛影响的）的讨论，弄清楚谁该赞扬，谁该反对，赞扬哪一点，反对哪一点，揭露许多历史上人物活动的真相，然后再进一步阐扬那些该受赞扬者的丰富的活动内容，这对我们的爱国主义思想教育和当前现实的革命斗争是有帮助的。
