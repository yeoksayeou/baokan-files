Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 8th: A special correspondent for this agency reports: After Ridgway issued his reply to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai on September 6th, the U.S. Air Force even more unscrupulously violated the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone, undermining the neutral zone agreement. On September 7th, the number of aircraft intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone reached the highest peak in the past week. From 7:50 a.m. to 3:10 p.m., an incomplete count showed a total of 23 sorties. According to reports from our military police observation posts: U.S. aircraft circled and reconnoitered over the neutral zone three times on the 6th and 7th. At 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, a U.S. reconnaissance plane circled once over Xu Lai-dong, about five kilometers south of Kaesong, and then flew east. At 7:50 a.m. on the 7th, a U.S. reconnaissance plane circled over Longtun-dong, east of Kaesong, and then flew to the Panmunjom area to reconnoiter for five minutes before flying southeast. According to incomplete statistics: Since the second bombing of the neutral zone by U.S. aircraft at 0:30 a.m. on September 1st, U.S. aircraft have intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone 100 times in the past week. The increasingly frequent illegal activities of U.S. aircraft have aroused serious concern among people from all walks of life here.
