Achievements and Main Experiences of the Huai River Project in 1951

Zeng Xisheng, Deputy Director of the Huai River Commission

A year has passed since the large-scale Huai River project began. Over the past year, the Huai River basin has begun to undergo tremendous changes. The most significant change is that the previously uncontrollable floods have begun to be brought under our control to a certain extent. The Huai River basin has celebrated an unprecedented harvest this year. But what is the progress of the project over the past year? What are the main experiences? This article will answer these two questions.

A. Basic Situation of this Year's Project

(1) Overall Achievements of the Huai River Project in the Past Year

The Huai River project of 1951 has been completed before the arrival of this year's flood season. The total amount of work includes the construction of 2,191 kilometers of embankments, the dredging of 861 kilometers of river channels, the commencement of construction of three reservoirs (one of which has been completed), 12 lake and depression flood storage projects, and 92 large and small sluice gates and culverts, all of which have been completed on schedule. A total of more than 2.2 million laborers were mobilized (excluding the mass-organized projects in northern Anhui), and calculating one workday per person, a total of more than 80 million workdays were completed, with more than 100 million cubic meters of earthwork completed (excluding nearly 100 million cubic meters of ditches and furrows built by the masses in northern Anhui), 126,000 cubic meters of stonework, and more than 30,000 cubic meters of concrete work. This project is the first phase of the entire Huai River project, and this first phase has initially completed the main measures for flood control in the Huai River basin. This year, the floods in the Huai River basin above Zhengyangguan, including the Pi River, Huang River, Hong River, and Ru River, were still very large, but the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River experienced ordinary floods. Our project plan was based on the worst-case scenario and designed according to the largest floods. Therefore, with the completion of these projects this year and our battle against the floods during the flood season, in addition to obtaining a bumper harvest of wheat and autumn crops, even if the largest flood were to occur this year, the Huai River basin could largely avoid disasters and ensure a bumper harvest of crops in most areas.

(2) Distribution of These Projects in the Upper, Middle, and Lower Reaches and Their Specific Effects

The distribution of the above projects in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, and their specific effects, are as follows:

Henan is located in the upper reaches of the Huai River basin's rivers. The Huai River basin originally had the phenomenon of drought and flood imbalances, and this characteristic is particularly significant in Henan. Therefore, the overall goal of the entire Huai River project is to control floods and develop water conservancy as a long-term goal in Henan. Water storage projects include mountain reservoir projects and lake and depression flood storage projects. Regarding reservoir projects, construction has begun on three sites this year: the Shimantan Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Hong River, the Banqiao Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Ru River, and the Baisha Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Ying River. Among them, the Shimantan Reservoir has now been fully completed. Regarding lake and depression flood storage projects, the Laowangpo and Tonghu flood storage projects in the Hong River basin and the Wu Songhu and Jiaotinghu flood storage projects in the Ru River basin have now been completed. In addition, most of the rivers in Henan have excessively narrow channels that cannot carry larger floods. This year, in order to focus on solving several problems, river channel improvement projects are coordinated with flood storage, focusing on the Hong River, Ru River, and Ying River, along with other rivers, carrying out embankment reinforcement, partial dredging, and some embankment retreat and cutoff projects.

In total, the flood storage projects completed in Henan can store 1.7 billion cubic meters of floodwater, accounting for about one-sixth of the total amount of floodwater that must be stored above Zhengyangguan when the largest flood occurs in the Huai River basin, which can have a great effect on flood control in the middle and lower reaches and in the province. Because the lake and depression flood storage areas are controlled, small amounts of water cannot flow in, and the wheat harvest in the spring was a bumper harvest (only Laowangpo was flooded in part because the project was not completed and the design was inadequate). Henan has about 140 large and small tributaries belonging to the Huai River system. This year's project mainly focused on controlling the Hong River, Ru River, and Ying River, which are the most flood-prone rivers. Therefore, although the floods in the Hong and Ru rivers were very large this year, the disaster area in the two river basins has been greatly reduced.

Most of the area north of the Huai River in Henan is a slope between the Yellow River and the Huai River. Affected by the Yellow River's flooding, the drainage system is silted up and internal waterlogging is a serious problem. This year, in addition to improving the river channels, drainage projects were also carried out with a focus in the Chenliu, Shangqiu, and Huaiyang regions, which also helped to alleviate internal waterlogging to a certain extent. In addition, soil and water conservation work was piloted in the mountainous areas of Yiyang and Biyang, with 182 gully dams built to test the method of intercepting water and retaining silt, to conserve soil and water and reduce the damage caused by mountain floods, which was very popular among the local people and needs to be widely promoted in other mountainous areas.

In northern Anhui, this year's Huai River project was carried out according to the principle of combining storage and drainage. The completed projects include flood storage projects. The decision on the governance of the Huai River announced by the State Council last year stipulated, based on the overall planning of the upper, middle, and lower reaches, that more than 5 billion cubic meters of floodwater must be stored in the middle reaches. The total flood storage capacity of the flood storage projects that have been completed has reached 7.2 billion cubic meters, exceeding the original estimate by 2.2 billion cubic meters. The main method is to use a series of depressions and lakes from Honghekou to Zhengyangguan, namely the Menghe Depression, Runhe Depression, and eight lakes and depressions including the West Lake of Huoqiu City, the East Lake of Huoqiu City, Jiangjia Lake, Mengjia Lake, Tangduo Lake, and Qiujia Lake, to store floodwater, and a huge diversion gate was built at Runheji as a basic control mechanism. After such storage, the outflow from Zhengyangguan can be limited to a certain flow rate to reduce the burden on the downstream river channel. Therefore, this project is one of the key projects in the entire Huai River project.

Secondly, embankment projects are also a key project that has been completed in northern Anhui. Because the total amount of flood storage that can be completed in the upper and middle reaches in this year's project only accounts for about 70% of the total amount of flood storage that must be completed above Zhengyangguan in the entire plan, it is estimated that if the largest flood occurs, the current river channel's discharge capacity will not be able to fully carry the downstream flow. Therefore, embankments must also be built to expand the river channel's discharge capacity. However, if the construction of embankments is carried out according to the largest flood, the project is extremely large and cannot be completed in one year. At the same time, judging from the development trend of flood storage projects in the upper and middle reaches, doing so would become an unnecessary waste in the future. Therefore, after discussion and decision by the Huai River Commission, the principle of temporarily sacrificing small interests to protect large interests was adopted. The north bank of the Huai River has a flat terrain, and the area of land protected by the embankments is the largest. The south bank of the Huai River is close to the mountains, and the affected area is smaller. Therefore, it was decided to reinforce the main embankment on the north bank of the Huai River from the Ying River in the east to the Hui River in the west to one meter above the planned flood level. Even if the largest flood occurs this year, this vast area can be ensured safety. As for the main embankment on the south bank of the Huai River, except for the Zhengyangguan urban area, the Bengbu urban area, and the mining area of the Huainan Coal Mine, which were built to one meter above the planned flood level, the rest were level with or below the planned flood level, so that if the largest flood occurs this year, the narrow area between the south bank of the Huai River and the mountains can be used to store excess floodwater, so that the entire northern Anhui will not suffer a huge disaster. If only ordinary floods or larger floods occur this year, this area can also be guaranteed safety in the current year. After the flood storage capacity of the flood storage projects in the upper and middle reaches increases in the future, this area will also become a safe area.

Another major project carried out in northern Anhui is the dredging of main and tributary rivers and drainage projects. Regarding the dredging of the main stream, a beach cutting project was carried out near the Bengbu Iron Bridge this year. For the dredging of tributaries, the Sui River and Xifei River were temporarily dredged according to the needs during the spring wheat planting season. At the same time, partial dredging was also carried out on the silted parts of the mouths of the Dongfei River, Qian River, Yao River, and Tian River. The largest of these projects was the Sui River dredging project, which excavated a total of more than 23 million cubic meters of earthwork, most of which were difficult to work with sand and gravel and mud taken from the water. In coordination with the tributary dredging project, drainage projects were carried out on a large scale in the Suxian and Fuyang regions. The combination of the two allows rainwater to flow into the tributaries and floodwater in the tributaries to be discharged smoothly. In total, it can solve the waterlogging problem for about 10 million mu of land.

To sum up the above-mentioned projects in the northern Anhui area, by coordinating water storage projects, embankment projects, dredging, and drainage projects, northern Anhui has achieved "no disasters in light rains and reduced disasters in heavy rains" this year. In the spring of 1950, northern Anhui was flooded with more than 4 million mu of land due to spring rain alone, while the spring wheat harvest this year was an unprecedented bumper harvest in the entire region. This autumn, except for a small amount of land in the Pi River basin that was flooded because the reservoir had not yet been built, the entire region, including the flood storage areas, has again achieved a bumper harvest. According to the situation after the completion of the project, even if the largest flood occurs this year, the vast area north of the Huai River, east of the Ying River, and west of the Hui River can be fully guaranteed. The internal waterlogging problem in this area has also been partially solved. Zhengyangguan, Bengbu City, and the Huainan Coal Mine area on the south bank of the Huai River can also be fully guaranteed. As for a part of the area on the south bank of the Huai River, some disasters are still unavoidable.

As for the Subei area in the lower reaches, although the flood in the Huai River in 1950 was large, no flood disaster occurred because the upper and middle reaches had already breached and Subei was able to arrange its defenses properly. This year, the east and west embankments of the canal have been repaired and strengthened, the Maotang Port has been dredged, the original culvert projects have been repaired as necessary, and the Guihai Sanba on the east bank of the canal have been repaired to prepare for the rare and severe situation of the Yangtze River and the Huai River rising at the same time. The Guihai Dam can be opened to divert part of the water flow. Because the project preparation has been greatly strengthened, the safety guarantee has naturally been increased.

(3) Two Outstanding Projects

Among all the projects mentioned above, two outstanding projects must be specially mentioned and explained, namely the Shimantan Reservoir project and the Runheji Diversion Gate project. The Shimantan Reservoir has a storage capacity of 47 million cubic meters, which is not very large, but it is the first reservoir we have built relying on our own strength since liberation, and it is a reservoir that uses earth dams to block water flow, which is particularly suitable for our current economic situation. In addition to the benefits of flood control, there are also irrigation benefits of about 90,000 mu. In order to promote the construction of earth dam reservoirs, we decided to build this reservoir first this year to gain experience and train cadres. With the successful completion of this reservoir, more and larger reservoirs can be completed one after another in the future. Therefore, although the role of this reservoir itself in governing the Huai River is not very large, it is a turning point in my country's water conservancy undertaking from eliminating harm to benefiting, and from simple flood control to multi-objective projects that take into account flood control, irrigation, navigation, and power generation. Its influence is far greater than its actual benefits.

The Runheji Diversion Gate is a huge sluice gate that controls the main stream of the Huai River and the West Lake of Huoqiu City. The project is divided into three parts: a fixed river channel made of reinforced concrete, which serves as a channel for year-round smooth flow; a dam; and a gate into the West Lake. When the Huai River rises, the opening and closing of these two gates can be used to regulate the flow of the Huai River to a certain flow rate. The fixed river channel is 78 meters wide. The dam is 300.5 meters wide, including five 45-meter gate openings and three 15-meter gate openings, and one 21-meter gate opening. The opening and closing of the gate is operated by oil pressure. We completed such a huge project, completely relying on domestically produced materials and machinery, and our own engineering personnel, along with material transportation, in about 100 days. Compared with the Yangzhuang movable dam or the Jingwei Canal head project built in the past reactionary ruling era, their scale is far less than the huge scale of the Runheji Diversion Gate, but they both took more than two years. This comparison can clearly show the superiority of our engineering organization and capabilities, and greatly enhance the strong confidence of all our staff and the people of the whole country in our own construction undertakings.

B. Our Main Experiences in the Project

The entire Huai River project in 1951, from decision to completion, including surveying, planning, and technical design, took a total of nine months. The main reasons why we were able to achieve such great results in such a short period of time are due to the wise and correct leadership of the Central Committee and specific care and instructions, the call for support from the entire party by the East China Bureau and the Central South Bureau, the active efforts of the vast masses, technical and administrative cadres in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River basin, the help of advanced Soviet experience, and the initiative cooperation of neighboring provinces and regions and relevant departments. As for the main experiences we have gained in the project, they are as follows:

(1) Correctly Implement the State Council's Overall Plan, Taking into Account the Upper, Middle, and Lower Reaches, and Combining Engineering and Disaster Relief, While Emphasizing Engineering

When the Huai River project first started last year, it was after the huge flood in 1950. More than 13 million people in the Huai River basin urgently needed to rely on work-for-relief to get through the difficult period after the flood. Because local cadres and the masses were eager to eliminate the harm of floods, they did not have time to conduct investigation and research, and mostly started from a local perspective, and there were various different opinions on governing the Huai River. There were also many contradictions in the interests of the upper, middle, and lower reaches. In order to solve these problems, we made the following arrangements for the entire work according to the decision of the State Council: First, with the help of national water conservancy institutions and other agencies, we organized 39 survey and measurement teams to conduct a comprehensive survey and measurement of the Huai River basin, and determined the basic plan for governing the entire Huai River basin, and solved the overall direction of the entire basin and the general direction of each province and region. Therefore, some specific problems of inconsistent interests in various regions can be properly solved under this general policy, according to the principle of local subordination to the whole and small interests subordination to large interests. Second, in order to largely eliminate the threat of serious floods in 1951, it was determined that the first phase of the project should complete the main measures in the entire flood control plan as much as possible. The standards and specifications of each project are based on the function it must undertake after the entire project is completed, to avoid unnecessary waste; for projects that cannot be carried out or completed for the time being, temporary measures should be used to remedy them first. Third, in order to immediately meet the masses' needs for work-for-relief, and to meet the requirements of emphasizing engineering, we divided the entire project into several main categories to master them separately. All projects that are critical, have a relatively large impact, and are technically complex are uniformly controlled by the Huai River Commission, and detailed engineering designs must be available before construction can begin; all projects that are interconnected in the upper, middle, and lower reaches and have an important relationship to the entire river, even if they are not highly technical, such as embankment projects, must also be uniformly controlled by the Huai River Commission, and construction can begin after standards are set according to the overall plan. As for some local mass projects, they are controlled by the provinces and can be started first to meet the needs of work-for-relief and disaster relief in various places. Due to such a work arrangement, a certain order has been produced in our entire work, and the engineering and disaster relief have been properly coordinated. As for the planning, design, and implementation of the project itself, we always adhere to the following principles: that local parts coordinate with the whole, the present takes care of the future, and eliminating harm takes care of benefiting, to meet the needs of the overall plan. As a result, the entire project can be launched quickly without major errors.

(2) Unified Leadership and Division of Responsibilities

Because governing the Huai River is a matter of joint protection by the three provinces and taking overall consideration, it must rely on the efforts of millions of people. Therefore, unified leadership is completely necessary and correct. Facts have proved that before the unification of the Huai River governance, many events of inconsistent steps, differing opinions, and conflicting actions occurred. After the unified leadership, these phenomena have been basically eliminated. However, precisely because of the arduousness of this task, on the one hand, the full support of the local government is needed, and on the other hand, specialized technical guidance is needed. Therefore, it is necessary to divide responsibilities by province, divide responsibilities by project nature, and divide responsibilities by front and rear lines on the construction site to exert strength. As far as the three provinces are concerned: unification is only the unification of major policies, such as the determination of project plans, the calculation of project funds, the formulation of financial systems, and the introduction of important experiences and lessons. Apart from this, all work is carried out by the provinces in a planned and led manner. As far as the nature of the project is concerned, in the construction of more technical projects (such as sluice gate projects), the engineering department is the main force and the local government is the auxiliary force; in the construction of more mass projects (such as embankment restoration and beach cutting), the local government is the main force and the engineering department is the auxiliary force. After the plan is decided, the construction is entrusted to the local government or the engineering department for control and construction, or for coordinated control and construction, depending on the nature of the project. The Huai River Commission only supervises, inspects, and guides. If there is a contradiction with the current central task (which is particularly prominent in northern Anhui, such as sideline production and spring plowing), the local government will make unified arrangements and implement the division of labor between the front and rear lines. Since the implementation of unified leadership last winter and such a division of labor, the projects in various places have not only ensured the engineering standards, but also improved efficiency and solved the difficulties in the work; on the contrary, they have delayed time and affected the progress of the work.

Another issue related to this issue is the issue of "grasping tightly and letting go" in leadership. Our approach is that the two must be combined: we must grasp tightly and let go. That is to say, we must rely on the masses, trust the cadres, and give full play to their initiative and creativity, while at the same time giving correct and timely guidance. For example, the Sui River dredging project is the most difficult project section in this year's Huai River project (with also great benefits, which can solve the internal waterlogging of millions of mu of land). It is precisely because the leadership can both let go and give timely guidance that it can overcome difficulties and complete the task. In order to achieve timely guidance, on the one hand, we conduct inspections and visits at any time, and use telephone reports to keep abreast of the situation. Another method is for the leading organs to personally control a key project to gain experience to promote other projects. For example, last winter, the Huai River Commission focused on the Bengbu City project, and other places also selected key projects, which played a good role in promoting the entire project. However, later, the work experience in various places has improved, and the types of projects have also increased. Some agencies have not been able to continue to select and cultivate new key projects to maintain a leading role, which is a shortcoming that should be corrected.

(3) There Must Be "Engineering Plans and Technical Designs Before Construction"

In the early stages of the Huai River project, because the project was huge and the data was insufficient, the planning and design required a considerable amount of time, and the masses' demands for work-for-relief were extremely urgent. Therefore, there were two tendencies in the thinking of the cadres: on the one hand, they only saw the urgency of the task and the urgency of the masses' demands, and ignored the importance of technical design. Therefore, they ignored the system and eagerly demanded the start of construction; on the other hand, they were accustomed to doing things as usual and overemphasized the difficulties of technology. Therefore, they had to postpone the project. The reasons for these tendencies are, on the one hand, that the administrative cadres do not have enough understanding of technology, so they do not have enough persuasion and guidance to the masses, and simply follow the demands of the masses. On the other hand, the technical cadres do not have enough practical experience, and they do not have enough understanding of the demands and strength of the masses. Therefore, they lack a clear grasp of the design and construction, and blindly pursue the completeness of the design data, and cannot distinguish which are the indispensable data and which are the problems that can be remedied. After we put forward the slogan of "relying on the masses and relying on science," vigorously carried out education, and appropriately grasped the two aspects of "adhering to the system" and "taking care of the actual situation" in the construction, all administrative and technical cadres have made great progress in their work. The administrative cadres have initially understood the technology and can become a bridge between the technology and the masses, and further give play to the strength of the masses. The creativity and inventions of the masses have solved many specific technical difficulties. The technical cadres have gained improvement in political and technical practical experience in engineering practice, so their work ability and responsible spirit have gradually developed, and they can grasp the situation and appropriately decide on the engineering plan. The combination of these two aspects of progress has enabled all our main projects to have technical designs before construction started. Although some individual projects caused partial waste in the transportation of grain and materials because the plan was decided too late or changed too much, all the projects have been preliminarily tested without any errors or failures.

(4) Establish Confidence in Relying on the Masses, Relying on Science, and Independent Creation

This spring, we organized more than 2 million people to work, and basically did not take detours and did not make major mistakes. As for the specific experience of organizing and leading the masses, it can be summarized as follows: (1) Doing a good job in preparation to overcome the chaos in the early stage of construction is the primary task. The Fuyang region in northern Anhui has summed up twelve preparation points, Subei has the method of "three inspections and five completions," and Henan has the method of four major preparations, [Note 1] all of which are effective experiences. (2) Overcoming the temporary views and employment thoughts of cadres, advocating administrative personnel to learn technology, and technical personnel to contact the masses, and conducting specific and in-depth ideological mobilization of the masses is the second major task. This year, the projects in various places have been greatly affected by the combination of the three major movements of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the improvement of mass awareness has had a great impact on the improvement of work efficiency and the expansion of the three major movements. (3) The labor organization of the masses should be based on the principle of facilitating life and facilitating labor. The basic organization should adopt the principle of voluntary combination, but in order to improve efficiency, after a certain period of time, after the laborers understand each other, it is also a good method to group them according to the strength of the labor force. (4) In order to ensure the quality of earthwork, earth tamping workers should be grouped separately. According to the experience of northern Anhui, a ratio of three to one for earth tamping workers is more appropriate. (5) The calculation of earthwork and the payment of wages are best done using the "contracted volume system." That is, the engineering agency and the laborers' classes and teams sign a contract, and the masses contract to do the earthwork project. The engineering agency does a gross calculation for the masses, which can reduce the trouble of piecemeal receipt, accounting, and food distribution; the masses have a whole understanding of the quantity of the project and can take the initiative to formulate their own plans; the laborers and laborers adopt the method of democratic scoring and work recording, and those who do more work can get more wages, which can improve the work enthusiasm of each person. (6) Establish labor discipline on the basis of consciousness to ensure the engineering standards and the mutual coordination between various labors. [Note 2] (7) Appropriately promote competition, but avoid overwork, so as not to affect the health of the laborers. (8) Carrying out mass engineering acceptance and proposing the maintenance of the project at the same time is an important task at the end of the project. The above methods ensured the timely completion of the Huai River project without major errors; as for individual areas, errors occurred temporarily due to insufficient leadership, which were quickly improved, and individual personnel caused errors or waste due to carelessness, which has been inspected and corrected. There are also many specific examples in the entire project. I will not list them one by one here.

The above is just some of my personal experience in participating in the leadership of this work. Summarized into one opinion, it is how to specifically learn and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts and methods in water conservancy engineering, especially learning the thoughts and methods suggested by Chairman Mao in "On Practice." Chairman Mao's thoughts are not only a summary of China's revolutionary experience, but also a guide for China's construction work. They are not only applicable to the organization and leadership of the masses, but also to scientific and technological research and practice. Our current understanding is very superficial and insufficient, but we are convinced that this is the only correct direction to move forward.

[Note 1] The twelve articles on construction preparation work in the Fuyang region are: (1) Coal and grain are transported well; (2) Laborers are mobilized and organized well; (3) Cadres are allocated well; (4) Construction sites are understood well (cadres look at the construction sites first); (5) Sections are divided well; (6) Tanks are drawn well; (7) Sample lines are placed well; (8) Slope rulers and soil piling rulers are made well; (9) Teams at all levels are arranged well; (10) Transportation and communication are set up well; (11) Work sheds are built well, and bedding is adjusted well (many disaster victims have no bedding); (12) Boilers are built well, and coal burning is learned well.

The method in Subei is to first check the ideology, check the organization, and check the tools before the laborers leave, which is called the three checks, and require that people are complete, hearts are united, tools are complete, firewood is complete, and living utensils are complete, which is called the five completions.

The experience in Henan is to do a good job in four preparations before starting construction: mobilization and organization, material preparation, engineering preparation, and typical experiments. Construction will not start if the preparations are not good.

[Note 2] During the winter repair in northern Anhui, in order to ensure engineering standards and the close coordination between various labors, the laborers discussed and formulated a convention, including three not lifting, four not hitting, and five obeying. The three not lifting are: not lifting frozen soil, not lifting cement soil, and not lifting pure sand; the four not hitting are: not hitting frozen soil, not hitting pure sand, not hitting soil piles that do not meet the standards, and not hitting soil rakes that are not level; the five obeying are: digging soil obeys picking soil, picking soil obeys leveling soil, leveling soil obeys walking tamping, walking tamping obeys the standards, and the whole obeys the command.

专栏：一定要把淮河修好！

    一九五一年治淮工程的成就及其主要经验
    治淮委员会副主任  曾希圣
    大规模的治淮工作已经一年了。一年来，淮河流域的面貌已开始了巨大的改变，最显著的改变，表现在：从来无法控制的洪水，在一定限度内已经开始被我们掌握了。淮河流域今年已庆空前的丰收。但是一年来工程进行的情况怎么样呢？有些什么主要经验呢？这篇文章就来答复这两个问题。
    甲、今年工程基本情况
    （一）一年来治淮工程的总的成就
    一九五一年的治淮工程，已经在今年洪水到来以前全部完成了。工程的总量，包括修筑堤防二千一百九十一公里，疏浚河道八百六十一公里，水库三处已经动工，其中一处已经完成，湖泊洼地蓄洪工程十二处，大小闸坝涵洞九十二座，都已按期完成，前后动员民工二百二十余万人（不包括群众自办的工程），每人做工一天算做一个工日，总共做了八千余万工日，完成土工一亿余立方公尺（另有皖北群众性的沟洫工程近一亿立方公尺未计算在内），石工十二万六千立方公尺，混凝土工三万余立方公尺。这个工程是全部治淮计划的第一期工程，这一期工程已经初步完成了淮河流域防洪工程的主要措施。今年淮河流域的洪水，正阳关以上的渒河、潢河、洪河、汝河洪水仍然很大，可是淮河中下游则是普通的洪水，我们的工程计划，是从最恶劣的情况出发，按最大洪水进行的设计，所以今年做了这些工程，并经过我们防汛期间对洪水的搏斗，除去获得麦秋两季的丰收以外，即便今年遇到最大的洪水，淮河流域也可以大部免除灾害，保障多数地区农产的丰收。
    （二）这些工程在上中下游的分布和其具体的效用
    上述各项工程在上中下游的分布，和它们所发生的具体的效用，情况如下：
    河南处在淮河流域各河的上游，淮河流域本来都有旱涝失调的现象，在河南这个特点尤其显著，所以在整个治淮的方针里面，规定河南的工程要以拦蓄洪水发展水利为长远的目标，蓄水的工程一种是山地水库工程，一种是湖泊洼地蓄洪工程。关于水库工程今年已经开始兴修三处，就是洪河上游的石漫滩水库，汝河上游的板桥水库，和颍河上游的白沙水库。其中石漫滩水库现在已经全部完成。湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，现在已经完成洪河流域的老王坡和潼湖蓄洪工程，汝河流域的吴宋湖和蛟停湖蓄洪工程。另外河南多数的河流，河槽过于狭窄，不能承泄较大的洪水，今年为了有重点地解决几个问题，河道整理工程是和蓄洪相配合，以洪河、汝河、颍河为主，连同其他各河，进行了培修堤防，局部疏浚，及一部分堤防退建和裁湾取直的工程。
    总计河南已经完成的蓄洪工程，可以拦蓄洪水十七亿立方公尺，约占淮河流域发生最大洪水时正阳关以上必须拦蓄的洪水总量的六分之一，对中下游和本省的防洪，可有极大的作用。湖泊洼地蓄洪地区，因为有了控制，小水不能流入，春季麦收都得了丰收（只有老王坡，在工程尚未完成的时候，因设计不周，洪水流入，一部分土地被淹）。河南属于淮河水系的大小支流约有一百四十余条，今年的工程主要是集中治理洪河、汝河、颍河几个水灾最重的河流，所以今年洪汝两河的洪水虽然很大，可是两河流域的受灾面积已经大为缩小。
    河南淮河北岸的大部地区，是黄河与淮河之间的坡地，因受黄河泛滥的影响，排水系统淤塞，内涝问题比较严重。今年除去整理河道以外，并在陈留、商邱、淮阳三个专区，有重点地举办了沟洫工程，对减轻内涝也有一定的帮助。另外在伊阳和泌阳山区试办了水土保持工作，修建了谷坊一百八十二座，试用截水留淤的方法，保持水土，并减轻山洪暴发的灾害，很受当地群众的欢迎，还需要在其他山区大量推广。
    在皖北，今年治淮的工程是根据蓄泄兼施的方针进行的，其已经完成的工程，首先是蓄洪的工程。去年政务院公布的关于治理淮河的决定，根据上中下游通盘的规划，规定中游必须拦蓄洪水五十亿立方公尺以上，现在已经完成的蓄洪工程的蓄洪总量，则已经达到七十二亿立方公尺，超过原来估计的数量二十二亿立方公尺。其主要的方法是利用从洪河口到正阳关，一连串的洼地、湖泊，就是蒙河洼地，润河洼地，霍邱城西湖、城东湖、姜家湖、孟家湖、唐垛湖、邱家湖等八处湖泊洼地，来拦蓄洪水，并在润河集修建一座巨大的分水闸，做为基本的控制机关。经过这样拦蓄以后，所以从正阳关下泄的就可以限制到一定的流量，以减轻下游河道的负担，所以这个工程，是全部治淮工程中关键性的工程之一。
    其次，堤防工程也是皖北已经完成的重点工程。因为在今年的工程中，上中游可以完成的蓄洪总量，只占全部规划中正阳关以上必须完成的蓄洪总量的百分之七十左右，估计如遇最大洪水，现在河道的泄量还不能全部承泄下泄的洪水，所以还必须修筑堤防，来扩大河槽的泄量。可是堤防的修筑，如果依照最大洪水进行修筑，工程异常巨大，不是一年所能完成，同时就上中游蓄洪工程发展的趋势来看，若这样做，将来也会成为不必要的浪费，所以经治淮委员会讨论决定，采取了暂时牺牲小利来保全大利的原则。淮河北岸，地势平整，堤防保护的土地面积最大，淮河南岸逼近山地，受灾的地区较小，所以决定，把颍河以东浍河以西，淮河北岸的干堤，加筑到计划洪水位以上一公尺。即使今年发生最大洪水，这一个广大地区，也可以确保安全。至于淮河南岸的干堤，则除去正阳关市区、蚌埠市区和淮南煤矿的矿区，修到计划洪水位以上一公尺以外，其余则平于或低于计划洪水位，为的是如果今年发生最大洪水，还可以利用淮河南岸和山区之间的狭长地带容蓄过量的洪水，使整个皖北不致发生巨大的灾害，如果今年只发生普通洪水或较大的洪水，这一地区当年也可保证安全，将来上中游蓄洪工程的蓄洪容量增加以后，这一地区就也成了确保安全的地区。
    皖北进行的另一项主要工程，是干支流的疏浚和沟洫工程。关于干流疏浚，今年在蚌埠铁桥附近进行了切滩工程。支流疏浚，则暂时根据春季种麦期间的需要，疏浚了濉河和西淝河，同时对东淝河、芡河、窑河、天河河口的淤塞部分，也进行了局部的疏浚，其中最大的工程是濉河疏浚工程，总共开挖土方二千三百多万立方公尺，并且多数都是砂礓和水中取泥的难工。配合支流疏浚工程，在宿县和阜阳专区大规模举办了沟洫工程，两者结合起来，内地雨水可以流入支流，支流洪水也能顺畅宣泄，总计可以解决一千万亩左右土地的涝灾。
    综合以上所说皖北区内的各项工程，把蓄水工程、堤防工程、疏浚和沟洫工程互相配合起来，今年皖北已经做到了“小雨免灾，大雨减灾”。在一九五○年春季，仅仅是春雨，皖北即已淹地四百余万亩，而今年春季的麦收，却在全区获得空前的丰收，今年秋季除去渒河流域因为水库尚未修筑，少数土地被淹外，全区连同蓄洪地区，又都获得丰收。根据工程完成以后的情况，今年即便遇到最大洪水，淮河北岸，颍河以东，浍河以西的广大地区，可以得到完全的保障，这一地区的内涝问题也已得到部分的解决。淮河南岸的正阳关、蚌埠市、淮南煤矿区，也可得到完全的保障。至于淮河南岸的一部分地区，则还难免有一部分灾害。
    至于下游苏北地区，一九五○年淮河的洪水虽大，可是因为上中游已经发生决口，同时苏北在防御上又能布置得宜，根本未曾发生水灾。今年对于运河东堤西堤已经修补加强，毛塘港进行了疏浚，原有的涵闸工程进行了必要的修整，又修整了运河东岸的归海三坝，准备万一遇到了长江淮河同时涨水的稀有的恶劣情况，可以开归海坝分泄一部分水流，由于工程的准备已经大为加强，当然更增加了安全的保障。
    （三）两个突出的工程
    在以上所说全部工程中，有两个突出的工程必须特别提出加以说明的，就是石漫滩水库工程和润河集分水闸工程。石漫滩水库蓄水量四千七百万立方公尺，容量并不太大，但是在解放以后却是我们依靠自己的力量举办的第一个水库，而且是修筑土坝来拦蓄水流的水库，特别适合我们目前的经济情况，除去防洪的效益以外，还有九万亩左右的灌溉的利益。我们为了提倡修筑土坝的水库，今年特别决定先行修筑这个水库，借以取得经验，培养干部。这一个水库能够顺利完成，以后就可有更多的更大的水库陆续完成，所以这个水库的本身对治淮的作用虽然不是很大，但却是我国水利事业从除害到兴利，从单纯的防洪，向兼顾防洪灌溉航运发电的多目标工程发展的一个转折点。它的影响之大远过于它的实际的效益。
    润河集分水闸是控制淮河干流和霍邱城西湖的巨大的水闸，工程分三个部分，一个是钢筋混凝土做的固定河槽，做为常年畅通的河道，一个是拦河闸，一个是城西湖口的进湖闸，在淮河涨水的时候，可以利用这两个闸的启闭，把淮河的水流调节到一定的流量。固定河槽宽七十八公尺。拦河闸宽三百公尺半，包括四十五公尺的闸门五孔，十五公尺的闸门三孔，二十一公尺的闸门一孔。进湖闸宽一百七十九公尺，包括四十五公尺的闸门二孔，二十一公尺的闸门四孔，闸门的启闭，用油压力操纵。像这样巨大的工程，我们完全依靠国内生产的材料机械，和自己的工程人员，连同物料运输，在一百天左右的时间内完成了它。和过去反动统治时代所做的杨庄活动坝或泾渭渠渠首工程相比，它们的规模远比不上润河集分水闸规模的巨大，却都用了两年以上的时间，这个对比可以明显看出我们的工程组织与能力的优越性，大大提高我们全体工作人员和全国人民对于自己的建设事业的坚强的信心。
    乙、我们在工程中体会到的主要经验
    一九五一年全部治淮工程，从决定到完成，连同测勘规划，技术设计，总共用了九个月的时间。我们所以能在这样短促的时间里，做出这样巨大的成绩，其主要的原因，是由于中央的英明正确的领导，和具体的关心指示，华东局和中南局号召全党的支持，淮河流域上中下游广大群众、技术和行政干部的积极努力，苏联先进经验的帮助，以及邻近省区和有关部门的主动地配合。至于我们在工程所体会到的主要经验，则有下列各点：
    （一）正确执行政务院通盘规划，上中下游通筹兼顾，工程与救灾相结合而又以工程为主的原则
    去年治淮工程方才开始的时候，是一九五○年巨大水灾之后，淮河流域有一千三百多万人口，急切需要依靠以工代赈，来度过水灾以后的困难时期。各地干部群众因为急于免除水灾的危害，来不及进行调查研究，多从局部出发，对治淮存在着种种不同的意见，上中下游之间，利害关系也存在着很多的矛盾，为了解决这些问题，我们根据政务院的决定，对于全部工作做了如下的布置：首先是在全国水利机构和其他机关的帮助下，组织起三十九个查勘测量队，进行淮河流域全面的查勘测量，确定了治理淮河的全流域的基本规划，解决了全流域的总的方针，和各省区的总的方向，于是各地区利害不一致的一些具体问题，在这总的方针之下，依照局部服从全体，小利服从大利的原则，都能得到适当的解决。其次，为了在一九五一年就能大部免除严重洪水的威胁，确定第一期工程要尽可能完成全部防洪计划中的主要措施。各项工程都按全部工程完成以后它所必须担负的功能，来规定它的标准规格，以避免造成不必要的浪费；其暂时不及举办或不能完成的工程，则先用临时性的措施、加以补救。其三，为了立刻满足群众对于工赈的需要，又要做到以工程为主的要求，我们把全部工程分成几个主要的类别，来分别掌握。凡是具有关键性的，影响比较重大，技术比较复杂的工程，都由治淮委员会统一掌握，必须做到先有详细的工程设计才能施工；凡是上中下游互相关联，对全河有重要关系的工程，即便技术性不高，如堤防工程等，也要由治淮委员会统一掌握，根据通盘计划，规定标准，然后施工。至于一些局部性的群众性的工程，则由各省掌握，可以先行开工，以配合各地工赈救灾的需要。由于这样一个工作的布置，使我们全部的工作，在纷乱中产生出一定的条理，使工程和救灾得到适切的配合。至于工程本身的规划设计和实施，则处处掌握着以下的原则：就是局部配合整体，现在照顾将来、除害照顾兴利，以符合通盘规划的需要，因之全部工程得以迅速展开，没有发生重大的错误。
    （二）统一领导与分工负责
    因为治淮是三省共保、统筹兼顾的事情，必须依靠千百万人的努力，所以统一领导是完全必需和正确的。事实证明在治淮未统一以前，曾发生过许多步调不一，意见参差、行动抵触的事件，统一领导以后，这些现象即已基本消除。但正由于这一任务的繁重，一面需要地方全力支持，一面需要专门技术指导，故又必须分省区负责，分工程性质负责，工地上分前后方负责，才能发挥力量。就三个省区来说：统一只是大政方针的统一，如工程计划的决定，工程经费的核算，财务制度的规定，重要经验教训的介绍等，除此以外，则都由各省区有领导有计划地进行工作。就工程性质说，在施工中技术性较大的工程（如闸坝工程），就以工程部门为主，地方为辅；群众性较大的工程（如复堤、切滩等土工），则以地方为主，工程部门为辅。当计划决定后，就根据工程性质，分别交地方或工程部门掌握施工，或配合掌握施工，治淮委员会只作督促、检查和指导。如与当前中心任务有矛盾者（在皖北特别突出的，如副业生产与春耕），则由地方统一部署，实行前后方分工。自去冬实行统一领导，并进行了这样的分工以后，各地工程不仅保证了工程标准，而且提高了效率，解决了工作中的困难；反是，就延误了时间，影响了工作进度。
    和这一问题相关的另一问题，是领导上“抓紧与放手”问题，我们办法是两者必须结合：既要抓紧，又要放手。就是要依靠群众，相信干部，充分发挥他们的积极性、创造性，而同时又要加以正确的、及时的指导。如濉河疏浚工程，是今年治淮工程最困难的工段（效益也大，可解决几百万亩土地的内涝），就是因为领导上既能放手又能及时给以指导，所以才能克服困难，完成任务。为要做到及时指导，一方面是随时检查巡视，利用电话经常汇报，以求确实掌握情况。另一个办法，是领导机关亲自掌握一个重点工程，以取得经验来推动其他工程。比如去年冬季治淮委员会就是以蚌埠市的工程为重点，其他各地也都各自选定了重点，对全部工程起了很好的推动作用。不过后来，各地工作的经验，都已提高，工程的种类又已增多，有的机关没有能够继续选择培养新的重点，以经常保持带头作用，则是应该改正的缺点。
    （三）必须“先有工程计划、技术设计，而后施工”
    治淮工程开始的初期，因为工程浩大，资料不足，规划设计需要相当的时间，而群众对于工赈的要求，异常迫切，因之在干部思想中存在两种偏向：一方面是只看见任务的紧急，群众要求的迫切，忽视技术设计的重要，因而不顾制度，急切要求动工的思想偏向；另一方面是习惯于照例办事，过分强调技术的困难，因而必须推迟工程的思想偏向。发生这些偏向的原因，一方面是由于行政干部对技术的了解不够，因而对群众的说服指导不够，单纯地追随了群众的要求。另一面是由于技术干部实践的经验不够，对于群众的要求和力量认识不足，因而对设计施工缺少确切的把握，一味地追求设计资料的完备，而不能辨别那些是必不可少的资料，那些是可以设法补救的问题。经过我们提出“依靠群众，依靠科学”的口号，大力进行教育，并且在施工中对于“坚持制度”和“照顾实际”两方面作了适当的掌握，全体行政和技术干部在工作中都获得极大的进步。行政干部初步地了解了技术，就可以成为技术和群众中间的桥梁，更加发挥了群众的力量，由群众的创造发明，解决了很多技术上的具体困难。技术干部在工程实践中获得了政治和技术实际经验的提高，因之工作能力和负责的精神也就逐渐开展，能够掌握情况，适当决定工程的计划。这两方面的进步相结合，使我们的全部的主要工程，都做到先有技术设计才开始动工，虽然有个别工程，因为计划决定过迟或变动太多，在粮食、器材的运输上造成部分的浪费，可是全部工程都经过初步考验，没有发生错误或是失败。
    （四）树立依靠群众，依靠科学，独立创造的信心
    今年春季我们组织了二百多万人进行工作，基本上没走弯路，没有发生重大错误。至于组织领导群众的具体经验，可概括为以下各点：（一）做好准备工作，以克服开工初期的混乱是首要的工作。皖北阜阳专区曾总结出准备工作十二条，苏北有“三查、五齐”的办法，河南有四大准备的办法，〔注一〕都是行之有效的经验。（二）对干部要克服临时的观点和雇佣的思想，提倡行政人员学习技术，技术人员联系群众，对群众进行具体深入的思想动员，是第二项主要工作。今年各地的工程，因为结合抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，群众觉悟大为提高，对工作效率的提高和三大运动的扩大，都有很大影响。（三）群众的劳动组织，要以便于生活，便于劳作为原则，其基础组织应当采取自愿结合的原则，但是为了提高效率，在经过一定时期，民工互相了解以后，按劳动力强弱分组，也是很好的办法。（四）为了保证土工质量，土硪工要分别编组，据皖北的经验，土硪工采取三比一的比例，比较适当。（五）土方的计算和工资的发放，以采取“包方制”效果最好。就是工程机关和民工班、队订立合同，由群众包做土方工程，工程机关对群众是趸做趸算，可以减少零碎收方、算账、发粮的麻烦；群众对工程的数量有了整个的了解，可以主动地自订计划；民工与民工之间，采取民主的评分记工的办法，多做工的可以多得工资，可以提高每个人的工作积极性。（六）要在自觉的基础上，建立劳动纪律，以保证工程标准和各种劳作之间的互相配合。〔注二〕（七）适当的提倡竞赛，但是要避免过度劳动，以致影响民工的健康。（八）进行群众性的工程验收，同时提出对于工程的养护，是结束工程的时候的重要工作。以上这些办法保证了治淮工程按时完成，一般没有发生错误；至于个别地区，因领导不足，暂时发生错误，很快就得到改善，个别人员因粗枝大叶，造成错误或者浪费，已经受到检查纠正，在全部工程中也有很多具体事例。这里不再一一列举。
    以上所说，只是个人在参加领导这一工作的一些体验，综括成一个意见，就是在水利工程当中怎样具体地学习运用毛主席的思想和方法，特别是学习毛主席在实践论里所提示的思想和方法。毛主席的思想不只是中国革命经验的总结，同时是中国建设工作的指针，不只适用于群众的组织领导工作，同时适用于科学技术的研究和实践，我们目前的体会虽然是很肤浅很不够的，但是我们确信，这是唯一正确的前进的方向。
    〔注一〕阜阳专区关于施工准备工作十二条，是：（一）煤粮运好；（二）民工动员组织好；（三）干部配备好；（四）工地了解好（干部先看工场）；（五）工段分好；（六）方塘划好；（七）样线放好；（八）坡度尺、堆土标尺做好；（九）各级队部安排好；（十）交通连络设置好；（十一）工棚搭好、被盖调整好（灾民许多无被盖）；（十二）锅炉建好、烧煤学好。
    苏北的办法是在民工出发以前，先查思想，查组织，查工具，是为三查，要求做到人齐，心齐，工具齐，烧柴齐，生活用具齐，是为五齐。
    河南的经验是在动工以前先做好动员组织、物质准备、工程准备、典型试验四项工作，准备不好不开工。
    〔注二〕皖北冬修时，为保证工程标准，密切各种劳作间的互相配合，由民工大家讨论订出公约，有三不抬、四不打、五服从等。三不抬是冻土不抬、水泥土不抬、纯沙不抬；四不打是冻土不打、纯沙不打、堆土不合标准不打、土扒不平不打；五服从是挖土服从挑土、挑土服从平土、平土服从行硪、行硪服从标准、全体服从指挥。（附图片）
