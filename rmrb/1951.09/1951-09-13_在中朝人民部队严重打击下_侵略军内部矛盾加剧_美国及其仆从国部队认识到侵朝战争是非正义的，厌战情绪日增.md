    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th, Dispatch from TASS: The Korean Central News Agency recently published a communication reporting on the escalation of disputes within the aggressor army in Korea, the corruption of the aggressor army officers and soldiers, and the decline in morale caused by military failures and the recognition of the injustice of the war they are waging.
    The dispatch stated: Currently, the troops of the aggressive bloc fighting in Korea belong to Syngman Rhee, the United States, Britain, Canada, Turkey, France, and other countries. The main force of this multi-ethnic army is the U.S. aggressor army. As a rule, the U.S. military enjoys privileges, and their supply of ammunition, weapons, and even food and clothing is more abundant than that of other troops. During offensives, the Syngman Rhee troops or the troops of Britain, Canada, and other countries are usually sent to lead the advance. Therefore, the losses of these troops on the Korean battlefield are generally very serious. In the event of a retreat, the U.S. military always retreats from the front line first to save their lives, leaving the Syngman Rhee, British, and Canadian troops to be wiped out. Americans openly proclaim the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race over other races and despise Syngman Rhee's followers and other partners involved in the intervention. All of this has long caused discord within the aggressive bloc. The military failures since the beginning of this year, the announcement of the Kaesong armistice negotiations, and the significant losses suffered by the aggressors during the offensive during the Kaesong armistice negotiations have particularly intensified their contradictions, even leading to rebellions, which the Americans suppressed by force.
    War prisoner Park Gil-pan (transliteration), formerly of the 2nd Regiment of the 12th Division of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, said this about the relationship between the Americans and the Syngman Rhee army: "In dangerous areas of the front line, the Americans always order the National Defense Forces (referring to the Syngman Rhee bandit army) to be in front to cover their combat troops. When the situation is unfavorable to the Americans, they are the first to retreat. However, the Americans always blame the National Defense Forces for their own escape and the failures they suffer. Often, Americans drive jeeps in a panic and flee from the front line. If there are National Defense Forces blocking the road and not giving way, they will open fire on the crowd, sometimes escalating into real battles. This kind of situation has become commonplace. Due to frequent failures, the Americans have become particularly quick in escaping from the battlefield. During the retreat, they abandon their weapons and then seize weapons from our soldiers and officers. Even the special orders of the National Defense Forces mention this situation, stating that if Americans attempt to seize the weapons of National Defense Forces officers and soldiers by force, they can open fire in self-defense."
    The Syngman Rhee army's hatred of the Americans is not only manifested in conflicts and shooting incidents, but has also evolved into real mutinies. Recently, such a mutiny occurred on Arison Island (transliteration), where the 8th Army reconnaissance team of the "United Nations Forces" was stationed. This unit was mainly composed of U.S. troops, with a team of Syngman Rhee troops. The soldiers of the Syngman Rhee army were angry at the contemptuous attitude of the Americans, who regarded them as an inferior race, and at the discrimination they often suffered everywhere and in everything. They demanded an increase in rations because the current rations were very insufficient. The American captain of this reconnaissance team not only rejected all the demands of the Syngman Rhee soldiers but also said that the Syngman Rhee soldiers should be happy to have food given to them. As a result, the Syngman Rhee troops mutinied. However, because this team was poorly equipped and could not get assistance from anywhere, the mutiny was brutally suppressed by the Americans.
    The corruption of the aggressor army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army is also intensifying. Deception and robbery of the people, as well as officers exploiting soldiers, have become commonplace. Senior and mid-level officers, realizing that the aggression will ultimately fail completely, are trying every means to make a fortune through plunder.
    Former "Minister of National Defense" Shin Sung-mo, Minister of Internal Affairs, Chief of Staff, and other senior officials of the Syngman Rhee "government" once embezzled a total of 5 billion yuan. Currently, the total amount they have embezzled has reached 24 billion yuan. Li San-ying (transliteration), a cook in the 8th Regiment of the 7th Division of the Syngman Rhee army, said: The food allowance for each soldier is 230 yuan, but the regimental commander deducts 100 yuan from it under the pretext of "improving the lives of the soldiers." In fact, the regimental commander put this money into his own pocket.
    In order to "boost the morale of the Syngman Rhee army and the U.S. military," the "United Nations Command" ordered that camp prostitutes could be brought to the front line.
    Incidents of soldiers deliberately committing suicide and deserting have become more frequent recently. War prisoner Huang De-meng (transliteration), a soldier in the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 15th Regiment, 6th Division of the Syngman Rhee army, said that officers threatened soldiers that they would be shot if they deserted. But many times, the officers themselves deserted. He said: In our regiment, ten company commanders and platoon leaders deserted within two months, not to mention the soldiers who deserted, there were soldiers deserting every day. There were a particularly large number of people deliberately committing suicide in this division because the soldiers did not want to fight. Therefore, one-third of the people in this division could not take on combat missions. These situations prove that the Syngman Rhee soldiers are unwilling to fight for the interests of the U.S. imperialists.
    Suicide is also common among the U.S. aggressor army. This is what Zhan Wang (transliteration), a soldier of the 1st Battalion, 23rd Regiment, 3rd Division of the Syngman Rhee army, said. He said: Near Anhan (transliteration), a U.S. sergeant led me behind a rock. He handed me his carbine and told me to shoot through his hand. As a result, I did as he asked. The sergeant told me that he belonged to the 9th Regiment of the U.S. 2nd Division. The motive for this deliberate self-harm is: the American soldiers are tired of the war, they want to go home, and they do not want to die in Korea.

    在中朝人民部队严重打击下
    侵略军内部矛盾加剧
    美国及其仆从国部队认识到侵朝战争是非正义的，厌战情绪日增
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社平壤十一日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社最近发表通讯，报道在朝鲜的侵略军内部争执的加剧、侵略军官兵的腐化、以及由于军事失败和认识到他们所进行的战争的非正义性而引起的士气低落。
    该电讯说：目前，在朝鲜作战的侵略阵营军队分属于李承晚、美国、英国、加拿大、土耳其、法国和其他国家。这个多民族军队的主力是美国侵略军。照例，美国军队享有特权，他们的弹药、武器、以至粮食服装的补给，都比别的军队充裕。在进攻的时候，被派去打前锋的通常总是李承晚部队，或是英国、加拿大等国家的部队。所以，这些部队在朝鲜战场上的损失一般都是很严重的。一旦退却的时候，美国军队总是最先撤离战线逃命，留下李承晚、英国和加拿大等军队束手被歼。美国人公开声言盎格鲁萨克逊种族优于其他种族，鄙视李承晚徒众和其他参与干涉的伙伴。这一切，老早就已经引起侵略阵营内部的不和。今年以来的军事失败，开城停战谈判的宣布，侵略者在开城停战谈判期间进行攻势所遭到的重大损失，都特别地加剧了他们的矛盾，甚至引起了叛乱，于是美国人用武力加以镇压。
    原隶属于李承晚伪军第十二师第二团的战俘朴吉盘（译音）谈到美国人和李承晚军队间的关系时，就这样说：“在战线的危险地区，美国人总叫国防军（按指李承晚匪军）在前面，掩护他们的战斗队伍。一旦情况对美国人不利时，他们是首先退却的。然而，对于他们自己的逃跑和他们所遭受的失败，美国人总是责怪国防军。往往美国人乘着吉普车慌慌张张地从前线逃跑下来，如果路上有国防军拥塞着，不给他们让路，他们便对人群开起火来，有时这会扩大成真正的战斗。这种情形已经是司空见惯的了。由于常常失败，美国人从战场逃跑的动作已来得特别迅速。在退却的时候，他们把武器都丢掉了，过后又从我们的士兵和军官手里夺取武器。甚至国防军的特别命令里都提到这种情形，并说明，如果美国人企图用武力夺取国防军官兵的武器，他们可以开枪自卫。”
    李承晚军对美国人的憎恨不仅表现在冲突与射击事件上，而且演变为真正的叛变。最近，在驻有“联合国军”第八军侦察队的阿里松岛（译音）上，就曾发生这种叛变。这支部队主要是由美军组成的，里面也有一队李承晚军。李承晚军的士兵对于美国人把他们当作劣等民族看待的轻蔑态度，对于他们在各处与各种事情上所经常遭受的歧视，感到愤怒。他们要求增加口粮，因为目前的口粮是很不够的。这支侦察队的美国队长不仅拒绝了李承晚士兵的全部要求，而且还说，李承晚士兵对于有食物发给他们应该感到高兴。于是，李承晚部队就叛变了。但是，因为这队人装备不好，并且不能从任何地方得到援助，叛变就被美国人野蛮地镇压下去了。
    侵略军与李承晚伪军中的腐败情形也正在加甚。欺骗与抢劫人民以及军官剥削士兵的情形，已经成为司空见惯的事。高级与中级军官了解到侵略终将完全失败，就想尽方法用掠夺的手段，捞一大笔钱。
    李承晚“政府”的前国防部长官申性模、内务部长官、参谋总长和其他的高级官员有一次共贪污了五十亿元。目前，他们贪污的总数已达二百四十亿元。李承晚军第七师第八团的伙夫李三英（译音）说：每个士兵的伙食费是二百三十元，团长以“改善士兵生活”为藉口，从中扣除一百元。实际上，团长把这些钱塞进了自己的腰包里。
    为了“提高李承晚军和美军的士气”，“联合国军”司令部下令在前线可携带营妓。
    士兵们故意自戕和开小差的情形近来更时常发生。战俘黄德孟（译音）是李承晚军第六师第十五团一营三连的士兵，他说：军官们威胁士兵们，如果他们开小差就要枪毙他们。可是有好多次，军官自己也开了小差。他说：在我们这一团中，两个月之内就有十个连长和排长开小差，士兵开小差的更不用说了，每天都有士兵开小差。这一师里故意自戕的人特别多，因为士兵不愿作战。因此，这师中有三分之一的人不能担负作战任务。这些情况证明李承晚士兵不愿为美帝国主义者的利益而作战。
    美国侵略军中自戕的情形也很普遍。这是李承晚军第三师第二十三团一营的士兵詹旺（译音）说的。他说：在安汉（译音）近郊，一个美国中士把我引到岩石后面去，他把他的卡宾枪交给我，叫我把他的手射穿。结果，我照他的请求做了。那个中士告诉我，他属于美军第二师第九团。这种故意自戕的动机是：美国士兵已厌倦战争，他们要回家去，他们不愿死在朝鲜。
