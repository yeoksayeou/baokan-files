    Reader's Letters
    Oppose the Atrocities of American Imperialism
    Support the Victims of the "Matsukawa Incident"
    To the Editor:
    After reading the letter published in your newspaper on September 22nd from the five innocent defendants of the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" to the People's Daily and the Chinese people, we have a deeper understanding of the cruel persecution of the Japanese people by the American imperialists and Japanese reactionaries. This illegal verdict against patriotic Japanese people is something that every kind-hearted person deeply detests and cannot tolerate.
    The Chinese people love peace, and the victorious Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have become strong defenders of world peace. We are constantly fighting to achieve world peace. On the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, we firmly support the just proposals of the Soviet Union and the repeated solemn statements of our Foreign Minister Zhou. We firmly support our Japanese brothers' just struggle for peace. We protest the illegal verdict of the Sendai High Court of Japan, demand that Teijiro Suzuki abolish the original verdict, and declare all innocent defendants not guilty. We must strengthen the struggle against the American arming of Japan and against the illegal American-Japanese peace treaty. We hope that the people of the whole country will give full play to the spirit of internationalism and fully support the just struggle of our Japanese brothers.

    We Should Pay Attention to Uniting and Reforming Folk Artists
    To the Editor:
    Since the National Conference on Opera Reform, various places in southern Anhui have begun to pay attention to opera reform. However, at present, most areas have only strengthened the organization and leadership of professional opera troupes, and rarely care about folk artists scattered in streets and alleys and in rural areas. For example, the People's Cultural Centers of Guangde and Ningguo counties in the Xuancheng Prefecture once believed that there were no fixed theaters in the area, so there was no need to do opera reform work, and they did not think of reforming folk artists. I think uniting and reforming folk artists is a very important political task. Taking Xuancheng Prefecture as an example, the number of folk artists is no less than that of professional opera troupes. In addition to some enlightened people who can independently compile some stories, ditties, and storytelling lyrics with better content, most of these folk artists are still singing the old routines, such as "Eighteen Touches" and "Little Carpenter Helping with the Plowshare," extremely obscene ditties. Once, when I walked through the Cross Street in Xuancheng, a ditty singer was still singing "The Long Hairs Rebel" (the Long Hairs refers to the peasant uprising of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom), distorting and insulting the peasant revolutionary movement. Because proper cultural and recreational activities in rural areas have not yet been universally and regularly carried out, these lyrics are still popular, and the audience they have is no less than that of professional opera troupes in cities. Therefore, if this propaganda force in the countryside can be organized, given appropriate education, reformed in their thinking, and assisted in adapting some ballads and ditties to tell new people and new things, it will certainly play a great role in promoting the current anti-American and aid-Korea and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements, and the propaganda of the Marriage Law in rural areas. I hope that relevant departments can pay attention to using this force.

    Shenyang Bureau of Culture and Education Violates the Trade Union Law
    Transferring Trade Union Cadres Without the Consent of the Trade Union
    To the Editor:
    The Shenyang Bureau of Culture and Education transfers a large number of education trade union cadres every semester at the beginning of the school year. According to our understanding, 53 members of the grass-roots committees were transferred at the beginning of this semester, and some of them were transferred without the approval of the higher-level trade union. This arbitrary transfer of trade union cadres seriously hinders the development of trade union work. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union has repeatedly protested to the Bureau of Culture and Education, but the Bureau of Culture and Education only unilaterally emphasizes the needs of administrative work, not only did not correct past mistakes, but intensified them. At the beginning of this semester, the Bureau of Culture and Education ordered the transfer of Comrade Jia Yaqin, chairman of the trade union of Xiaoxi Complete Primary School, to Xinghua Primary School as the deputy director of teaching. The Xiaoxi Complete Primary School Committee of the Education Trade Union took into account the needs of trade union work; the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Education Trade Union also considered that the grassroots organization of the school was an object of cultivating typical examples, and if Comrade Jia Yaqin was transferred, it would hinder the development of trade union work in the school, so the school committee of the trade union and the municipal committee of the trade union disagreed with the transfer of Comrade Jia Yaqin. According to Article 11 of the Trade Union Law: "If the administrative side or the capital side transfers or dismisses the members of the trade union committee elected by the masses, it must first obtain the consent of the trade union committee and then transfer it to the higher-level trade union committee for approval before it can be implemented." The Personnel Section of the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education did not obtain the consent of the Xiaoxi Complete Primary School Trade Union Committee before transferring Comrade Jia Yaqin, and the Municipal Education Trade Union did not approve it. When the trade union expressed its disagreement with the transfer, the Personnel Section of the Bureau of Culture and Education not only did not withdraw its order, but also used threatening means to force Comrade Jia Yaqin to hand over work. This practice is obviously wrong. In order to strictly implement the Trade Union Law to ensure the development of trade union work, it is hoped that the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education will review the mistakes of transferring trade union cadres at will without the consent of the trade union, and hope that such mistakes will not happen again in the future.

    Anshan and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plants
    Iron Raw Materials Produced Do Not Meet Specifications
    To the Editor:
    The pig iron raw materials used in the foundry of our Jinan Railway Factory are all produced by Anshan and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plants. In the past six months, the iron raw materials produced by the above two plants have had serious non-compliance with specifications. For example, the rectangular flat pig iron block should have four grooves, the function of which is to make it easy to break and melt. However, the grooves on the iron blocks produced by these two factories are too shallow (so shallow that they are almost invisible), which has caused great difficulties in our work. In the past, each person could smash one ton of pig iron blocks per hour, but now they can't smash one ton in two hours. As a result, our factory wastes more than one hundred workdays per month. In the past, one kilogram of coke could melt six kilograms of iron, but now, because the sizes of the smashed iron blocks are uneven, each kilogram of coke can only melt five kilograms of iron, so a large amount of coke is wasted every month, causing undue losses to the country. Therefore, I request that the two plants correct the above shortcomings.

    反对美帝国主义的暴行
    声援“松川事件”的被害者编辑同志：
    看了九月二十二日贵报发表的日本“松川事件”五位无辜被告给人民日报及中国人民的来信，我们更深刻地认识到美帝国主义者和日本反动派对日本人民的凶残迫害的情况。这种对日本爱国人民的非法判决，是我们每一个善良的人所深痛恶绝并且决不能容忍的。
    中国人民热爱和平，胜利后的中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，更成为世界和平的坚强保卫者。我们无时不在为实现世界和平而斗争。我们在对日和约问题上坚决拥护苏联的公正建议与我国周外长历次的严正声明。我们坚决支援日本兄弟们为争取和平的正义斗争。我们抗议日本仙台高等裁判所的非法判决，要求铃木祯次郎废除原判，并宣布全体无辜被告无罪。我们要加强反对美国武装日本和反对美国非法对日和约的斗争。我们希望全国人民一致发挥国际主义的精神，全力支援日本兄弟们的正义斗争。

    应该注意团结改造民间旧艺人编辑同志：
    自从全国戏曲改革工作会议以后，皖南各地对戏曲改革工作已开始注意。但目前大多数地区，还仅对职业剧团加强了组织和领导，而对散布在街头巷尾及农村中的民间旧艺人则很少关心。如宣城专区广德、宁国等县人民文化馆，一度认为本地无固定剧院，所以不需要做戏曲改革工作，而没有想到去改造民间旧艺人。我认为团结改造民间旧艺人是一项很重要的政治任务。拿宣城专区来说，民间艺人人数不少于职业剧团。这些民间艺人除有些觉悟较高的能够自行编制一些内容较好的故事、小调、说唱词外，绝大多数还是在唱老一套，如“十八摸”、“小木匠扶犁梢”之类极端淫秽的小调。我有次走过宣城十字街，一个唱小调的还在唱“长毛造反”（长毛是指太平天国起义的农民）歪曲与污辱农民革命运动。由于农村正当的文化娱乐活动还未能普遍经常地开展起来，所以这些唱词依然受到欢迎，它拥有的听众决不少于城市中职业剧团的观众。因此，如果能把这一农村中的宣教力量组织起来，给予适当教育，改造他们的思想，协助他们改编一些鼓词、小调，以说唱新人新事，对目前农村中开展抗美援朝及镇压反革命运动，宣传婚姻法等工作，一定能起很大推动作用，希望有关部门能够注意使用这一力量。

    沈阳文教局人事科违反工会法
    不经工会同意调动工会干部编辑同志：
    沈阳文教局在每学期开学时，都大量调走教育工会干部。据我们了解，本学期开学时，调动了基层委员会的委员五十三名，其中一部分是不经上级工会批准即调走的。这种任意调动工会干部的现象，严重地妨碍了工会工作的开展。中国教育工会沈阳市委员会曾屡次向文教局提出抗议，但文教局只片面强调行政工作的需要，不但没有纠正过去的错误，反倒变本加厉了。本学期开学时，文教局下令调动小西完全小学工会主席贾雅琴同志去兴化小学当副教导主任。教育工会小西完全小学委员会照顾到工会工作的需要；教育工会沈阳市委员会也考虑到该校基层组织是培养典型的对象，如果贾雅琴同志被调走，会妨碍该校工会工作的开展，因此工会校委员会和工会市委员会对调动贾雅琴同志都不同意。按工会法第十一条规定：“行政方面或资方，如调动或解雇由群众所选出之工会委员会的委员时，须事先取得各该工会委员会之同意，并由该委员会转请上级工会委员会批准后，方得实行之。”而沈阳市文教局人事科调动贾雅琴同志之前，未取得小西完全小学工会委员会的同意，市教育工会也未批准。当工会表示不同意调动时，文教局人事科不但不收回其命令，而且用威胁手段强迫贾雅琴同志交代工作，这种作法，显然是错误的。为了严格执行工会法，以保证工会工作的开展，希望沈阳市文教局对不经工会同意、随便调动工会干部的错误进行检讨，并希望今后不再发生这样的错误。

    鞍山、石景山两钢铁厂
    所产生铁原料不合规格编辑同志：
    我们济南铁路工厂翻砂场所用的生铁原料，都是鞍山、石景山两个钢铁厂的出品。最近半年以来，上述两厂所产生铁原料，有严重的不合规格的情况。如长方扁形的生铁块上，应该有四个槽沟，其作用是为了容易折断，便于溶化。但是，这两个工厂所产生铁块上的槽沟太浅了（浅的都快看不出来），这就造成了我们工作上极大的困难。过去每人一小时可以砸一吨生铁块，现在两小时都砸不到一吨。我场就因此每个月要浪费一百多个工。从前一公斤焦炭能化六公斤铁，现在由于砸开的铁块大小不均，每公斤焦炭只能熔五斤铁，这样每个月就要浪费大量焦炭，使国家受到不应有的损失。因此我要求该两厂纠正上述的缺点。
