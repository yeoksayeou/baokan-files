A Pictorial with a Large Readership
    ——Introducing "Serial Pictorial"

    Since its publication, the circulation of "Serial Pictorial" has increased from 200,000 copies of the first issue to 400,000 copies of the fourth issue (the distribution volume after the fourth issue has not been calculated). This increase demonstrates the broad masses' love for the serial pictorial art form and proves that publishing such a pictorial to carry out popular and accessible publicity and educational work among the masses is entirely correct.

    The popularity of serial pictorials in China surpasses that of any other art form except for New Year pictures. Even with the widely circulated New Year pictures, the purchasing habits of the broad masses are limited by seasonality (mostly around the Spring Festival). However, serial pictorials do not have this limitation. At any time, as long as transportation conditions permit, in cities or towns, serial pictorials have many loyal readers. There are also many places where serial pictorials are sold – bookstores on the streets, bookstalls in the alleys, everywhere has its traces. In addition, there are mobile bookstalls on bicycles. There are many readers. If we want to use art to do popular work, serial pictorials are one of the best ways.

    However, many of the serial pictorials published before liberation contained toxins, from promoting feudal superstition to advocating the American way of life, and even serial pictorials that promoted reactionaries and secret agent activities. The ideological poisoning and deception that these serial pictorials gave to readers is conceivable. Since liberation, we have also published many serial pictorial albums, many of which are rich in educational content and have a very serious creative attitude. For example, "Chicken Feather Letter," "Mr. Dong Guo," "Wang Xiuluan," and "New Children's Heroes," published by Beijing Popular Picture Publishing House, and "Dan Niang," "Zhao Bai Wan," etc., published by Shanghai Popular Fine Arts Publishing House, are all excellent serial pictorials and loved by many readers. However, it cannot be denied that the content of many serial pictorials is also wrong, such as the "Young Master Soldiers" that promote pro-American ideas (the revised version has been corrected, but not thoroughly), "Golden Earring" and "Yun Guniang" that blur the class position, and the "25,000-Li Long March" serial pictorial that made incorrect descriptions of ethnic minorities (the examples of serial pictorials with erroneous content cited here are extremely incomplete because we only looked at a part of the serial pictorials. These may also not be the most serious examples of errors). There are even crudely made works that are being sold secretly. From this point of view, "Serial Pictorial" shoulders a fighting task. It should be responsible for introducing good serial pictorials to readers, and the pictures published in "Serial Pictorial" should have a demonstrative nature (from ideological to artistic. Although the current works cannot all achieve this, they should gradually achieve it). It can also reprint good serial pictorials from other newspapers and periodicals, and can also use words to criticize those erroneous serial pictorials. For example, in the third issue, it criticized two bad serial pictorials, "Wu Xun" and "The Story of Wu Xun," which is a very meaningful work. "Serial Pictorial" should regularly publish such guiding texts, telling readers how to choose good serial pictorials, telling them which serial pictorials are bad, so that readers will not be deceived. I think this should be a feature of "Serial Pictorial." The second feature that "Serial Pictorial" should focus on in editing is to closely integrate with the current propaganda center and timely reflect the reality of the struggle. Many single-volume serial pictorials are more difficult to closely integrate with the current movement because of their long length, long stories, and long creative process. Therefore, although they also have their educational role, they are flawed in terms of reflecting and guiding the current reality of the struggle. Since its publication, "Serial Pictorial" has used many short serial pictorials to report on the Resist America, Aid Korea, Suppress Counter-revolutionaries, Purchasing Cotton and Storing Cotton, and Drafting Patriotic Pledges movements. In order to cooperate with the Party's birthday, it published the "Jinggang Mountain" serial pictorial, depicting the heroic combat life of the Red Army. On the "August 1st" Army Day, the "25,000-Li Long March" serial pictorial was published. This can timely and regularly educate readers.

    "Serial Pictorial" is a form of publication. It can publish serial pictorials of various themes in each issue. All meaningful events, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, can be drawn into pictures. For example, the "Xian Gao Loves the Motherland" serial pictorial published in the second issue, although it is an ancient story, instills readers with patriotic ideas. The "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" myth in the fourth issue also tells readers the preciousness of the Chinese people's perseverance and determination. In addition to this, there are also two issues that published scientific knowledge such as "Terrible Flies" and "Treating Cattle Bloat Disease." This makes the content of the pictorial rich and diverse, and readers also get various aspects of knowledge and education. This is also worth mentioning. As long as it does not harm the propaganda center of each issue, this type of picture should be added in a more planned way.

    "Serial Pictorial" is such a popular and accessible reading material. Since it is welcomed by the broad masses of readers, it should unite and organize the country's artists to create more excellent works and recommend these works to readers. Artists should also see that it is the pictorial with the most readers, and it is one of the best tools for us to engage in popular work among the broad masses. They should use great efforts to support this publication and make it better.

    一本拥有大量读者的画报
    ——介绍“连环画报”
    华君武
    “连环画报”社编辑，人民美术出版社出版
    “连环画报”从出版以来，已经从第一期的销数二十万册增加到第四期的四十万册（第四期以后的发行数量未计算）。这个数目的增加说明了广大的群众喜爱连环画这一美术形式，也证明出版这样一本画报向群众进行普及的、通俗的宣传教育工作是完全正确的。
    连环画在中国普遍销行的情况，除年画外是任何其它美术形式所不及的，就拿销行很广的年画来说，广大人民在购买习惯上也有季节性的限制（大都在春节前后），但是连环画就没有这种限制，任何时候，只要交通条件允许，在城市或镇子里，连环画就有许许多多忠实的读者；推销连环画的场所也极多，大街上的书店，小巷里的书摊，到处都有它的踪迹。此外还有把连环画放在自行车上的流动书摊。读者是很多的。我们要用美术来做普及工作，连环画是最好的方式的一种。
    但是在解放以前出版的许多连环画，大部分都含有毒素，从宣传封建迷信一直到宣扬美国生活方式，甚至于有宣扬反动派和特务活动的连环画，这些连环画所给予读者在思想上的毒害和欺骗是可想而知的。解放以后我们也出版了许多连环画册，其中有许多是富有教育内容，创作态度也十分严肃的作品。举例说，北京大众图画出版社出版的“鸡毛信”、“东郭先生”、“王秀鸾”、“新儿女英雄传”，上海大众美术出版社出版的“丹娘”、“赵百万”等等都是优秀的连环画，为许多读者所喜爱。但是不容否认，也有许多连环画的内容是错误的，例如宣传崇美思想的“少爷兵”（修正本已经有了改正，但不彻底），模糊阶级立场的“金耳环”和“芸姑娘”，对少数民族作了不正确的描写的“二万五千里长征”连环画（这里所举有着错误内容的连环画的例子，由于我们只看了一部分连环画，因此是极不全面的。这些也可能还不是最严重的错误例子）。甚至于有一种粗制滥造的作品，也在暗地行销。从这种情况来看，“连环画报”就担负着一种战斗的任务，它应当向读者负责介绍好的连环画，而“连环画报”刊登的图画就应该带有示范性质（从思想性到艺术性。虽然现在的作品还不可能大部作到，但应当逐渐作到），也可以转载其它报纸和刊物中好的连环画，也可以用文字批评那些错误的连环画。例如在第三期对两本坏的连环画“武训”和“武训传”进行了批评，这就是很有意义的工作。“连环画报”应该经常刊登这类指导性的文字。告诉读者如何去选择好的连环画，告诉他们那些连环画不好，使读者不至于受蒙蔽，我想这应该是“连环画报”的一个特点。 “连环画报”在编辑工作上所应当注重的第二个特点是要紧密地结合当前的宣传中心，及时地反映现实斗争。许多单行本的连环画由于篇幅多，故事长，创作的过程也较长，和当前的运动紧密结合就比较困难，因此虽然也有它的教育作用，但是就反映和指导当前的现实斗争来看，是有缺陷的。“连环画报”出版以来用着许多不长的连环画来报道了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、购棉储棉、订立爱国公约等运动；为了配合党的生日，刊登了“井岗山”的连环画，描写红军的英勇战斗生活；在“八一”建军节时，刊登了“二万五千里长征”连环画。这样就能及时地，经常地教育读者。
    “连环画报”是一种刊物的形式，它可以在每一期中刊登各种题材的连环画，古今中外各种有意义的事情都可以画成图画，例如第二期刊登春秋时代
    “热爱祖国的弦高”连环画，虽然是古代的故事，却灌输读者以爱国主义的思想；第四期的“愚公移山”的神话也告诉了读者中国人民的毅力和决心的可贵；除此以外，还有两期刊登了“可怕的苍蝇”、“治牛臌胀病”等科学常识；这样就使得画报内容变得丰富和多样，读者也得到多方面的知识和教育，这也是值得一提的问题，只要在不妨害每期宣传中心的情况下，应该更有计划地添加这一类的图画。
        “连环画报”既是这样一种通俗和普及的读物，既然受到广大读者的欢迎，它就应该团结和组织全国的美术工作者，创作更多的优秀作品，并把这些作品推荐给读者；美术工作者也应该看到它是拥有读者最多的画报，是我们向广大群众从事普及工作的最好的工具之一，应当用很大力量来支持这个刊物，把它办得更好。
