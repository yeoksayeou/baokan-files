    CCP China Native Produce Company Branch
    Self-Criticism for Not Respecting Time at Meetings

Editor:

    We have seen the letter from Comrade Li Jiahe published in the People's Daily's "Readers' Letters" column on August 9th, "The Bad Habit of Not Respecting Meeting Times Should Be Corrected." This problem exists in our branch, and is also reflected in the various meetings held by our company's administration.

    On July 1st, we convened a large meeting. The notice was issued the day before, stipulating that the meeting would start promptly at 7:30 AM on July 1st. On the morning of July 1st, it rained, and the person responsible for convening the meeting hesitated: if we hold it, we are afraid that no one will attend; if we don't hold it, the notice has already been issued. Therefore, it was delayed until many comrades had already arrived at the venue before it was decided to continue the meeting. This caused many people to wait and waste a lot of time. In order to emphasize the importance of meeting times and overcome the lingering guerilla habits in the future, the branch convened a meeting on August 13th, and all branch committee members made profound self-criticisms. It was also decided to implement this spirit in all party and non-party meetings.

### 中共中国土产公司支部对开会不遵守时间的检讨

    中共中国土产公司支部
    对开会不遵守时间的检讨编辑同志：
    我们看到人民日报八月九日读者来信栏内所发表李嘉禾同志所提出的“应纠正不遵守会议时间的恶劣作风”，这在我们支部是存在着的，同时也表现在我们公司行政上所召开的各种会议上。
    七月一日我们召开的大会，是前一天发出的通知，规定七月一日上午七时半准时开会。七月一日早晨下雨，负责召集开会的人首先就犹豫起来：开吧，又怕没人来出席，不开吧，已发出通知。因此拖延到不少的同志已到达会场后，才决定继续开会。这样就使很多人等着浪费了很多时间。为使今后重视开会时间，克服拖拖拉拉的游击习气起见，支部已在八月十三日召开会议，各支委都作了深刻的检讨；并决定将此精神贯彻到党内外各种会议中去。
                            中国共产党中国土产公司支部
