    Suiyuan Province Holds Cadre Conference Commemorating Second Anniversary of Uprising
    Salutations to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    [Reported by this newspaper] On September 19th, cadres of the Suiyuan Uprising held a conference commemorating the second anniversary of the uprising. The conference passed the following letter of salute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    Today is the second anniversary of the "September 19th" Uprising in Suiyuan. As we commemorate this glorious day with excitement and joy, we first extend our most sincere respects to you. Over the past two years, following your instructions to "unite as one, strive for progress, reform the old system, implement new policies, and struggle to build a new Suiyuan for the people," we have actively and diligently carried out a series of revolutionary movements, including suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, adjusting land, resisting America and aiding Korea, and vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries. These efforts have stabilized social order, raised the enthusiasm for production, and consolidated the people's democratic regime, giving Suiyuan a completely new look. Recently, we successfully concluded the rectification and cadre review movement, further enhancing the thinking of cadres, consolidating unity, and purifying the revolutionary ranks. These achievements have created very favorable conditions for implementing land reform this winter and next spring. On this day commemorating the second anniversary of the "September 19th" Uprising, we assure you that under your leadership, we will strive for progress, more closely unite the people of all ethnic groups and sectors in Suiyuan, work hard to complete land reform, and fight for the glorious task of completely liberating Suiyuan.
    The Suiyuan Province Cadre Conference Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the "September 19th" Uprising respectfully.
