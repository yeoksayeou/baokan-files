    American "Democracy" Behind the Iron Curtain
    Bèi Lín

    In October 1947, Mr. Austin, the chief representative of the United States to the United Nations General Assembly, opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to condemn war propaganda. He summarized his lengthy remarks, which defended the freedom to incite war, with the following words: "The United States delegation opposes any attempt, direct or indirect, to restrict freedom of speech."

    Thus, in this "bastion of democracy" on the west coast of the Atlantic, freedom of speech is supposedly so sacred that even madmen who openly advocate using atomic and germ warfare to eliminate millions of people are guaranteed full freedom to speak, write, and broadcast.

    However, despite the hypocritical chants of "democratic freedom" by American politicians, such "freedom" does not exist for those who advocate peace, democracy, and progress.

    As everyone knows, the Communist Party of the United States has always been at the forefront of the struggle for peace, a struggle waged by the best Americans against a handful of atomic maniacs.

    But because the leaders of the Communist Party exercise their right to freedom of speech to expose the warmongers, they are thrown into prison. The Truman administration's prosecution of the Communist Party leaders proves that they are imprisoned precisely because Dennis and his comrades practiced the freedom of speech that Austin hypocritically proclaimed from the podium of the United Nations. The charges against the Communist Party leaders in the indictment are: one of them "caused an article to be published," another "was seen walking out of a Party office," a third "taught a class at the Jefferson School," and a fourth was "engaged in Party activities"...

    These so-called "crimes" are so ridiculously fabricated, and the violation of freedom of speech and human rights is so blatant, that even Supreme Court Justice Douglas had to point out: "To make legal speech illegal... is to fundamentally depart from the past and violate the basic principles of our constitutional system" (Douglas was one of the two judges in the Supreme Court who dissented on principle).

    The illegal imprisonment of the Communist Party leaders paved the way for another fascist attack on individual freedom and another violation of the American Constitution. This time, the "criminals" are those who provided bail for the arrested Communist Party leaders.

    Federal Judge Ryan has ordered the "Civil Rights Congress" to reveal the names of those citizens who lent money to the Congress for bail, or else the members of the Civil Rights Congress will also be imprisoned.

    Not long ago, the drafters of the fascist McCarran Act proposed an amendment to supplement this dark law. Based on this "amendment," many American progressives are being tried and persecuted. It created a more barbaric atmosphere of terror, declaring it illegal for anyone to join the Communist Party or "Communist front" organizations, or to engage in trade union representation or leadership. According to this "amendment," any worker who participates in any "subversive organization" listed on the Department of Justice's list and refuses to report it to the authorities can be fired. This list of the Department of Justice contains nearly one hundred and fifty "subversive organizations," and also includes those organizations that advocate peace or aid the victims of the Franco terror regime.

    Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that the reactionary American newspapers are demanding the mass arrest of ordinary citizens. The notorious rogue writer Pegler wrote in the Hearst newspaper *New York American Journal* (June 27) that with the decision to imprison the Communist Party leaders, it is possible and necessary to immediately imprison "thousands of New Deal supporters" (i.e., those who support Roosevelt's policies – editor), because "according to this precedent, these people are all guilty of criminal conspiracy with the Communist conspirators." Pegler advocated sentencing these New Deal supporters to death "without having to technically prove the treason of each individual."

    Thus, the lawless darkness caused by anti-communism will gradually be expanded to afflict millions of ordinary American citizens.

    ★      ★      ★

    The vanguard of the fascist attack on the rights of the American people is the so-called "Federal Bureau of Investigation," this secret police organization.

    The FBI was established in 1908, the protagonist being the then Attorney General, a Mr. Bonaparte, aptly named. Since the end of World War II, the FBI has inherited the mantle of the American "Gestapo" (i.e., secret police). Its claws have reached into every industrial enterprise, agency, and trade union, and its agents have infiltrated church groups, schools large and small, clubs, restaurants, and barber shops. Meanwhile, telephone tapping has become its main daily task. This secret police agency, which is only accountable to itself, has an annual budget of $50 million. It has more than 11,000 professional agents, and according to a statement by the bureau's director, Hoover, its informer system submits as many as two hundred reports on individual citizens every day.

    On July 2, the *New York Herald Tribune* quoted Hoover as saying that the bureau now has more than 118 million fingerprint records. In Los Angeles alone, according to local police chief Bernasch, "40,000 citizens' fingerprints are recorded every year, and my fingerprint team can process 15 to 20 sets of fingerprints per hour."

    American writer Rowansa, in his recent book describing the FBI's dark activities, says that in many industries, workers cannot find jobs without letting employers record their fingerprints. However, after submitting their fingerprint records, if the FBI considers him an "unstable element," he still cannot find a job.

    The following example is typical of the so-called security methods used by the bureau in industry. Not long ago, a "Greater Cleveland Defense Conference" was held in Cleveland, Ohio, with 350 factory managers attending. The focus of the conference was "sabotage activities." Before the discussion, a demonstration of the explosion of small factory models was performed. Then, the personnel director of the American Steel and Wire Company delivered a speech, telling the audience how to deal with "saboteurs": The past history of each worker should be recorded for at least the most recent five years; each worker should leave fingerprint records for the FBI to investigate; each worker should wear a special badge and be allowed to move only within his department; and everyone should pay attention to discovering and reporting any remarks that can be considered "communist."

    The conspiracy of big capitalists and the FBI against the American laboring people also has more insidious ways, that is, buying students as spies. In Buffalo, New York, the big capitalists used typical "Gestapo" methods, distributing leaflets to all public school students, asking them to report "subversives" to the FBI. This leaflet was discussed at a district education authority meeting, and it was found that Winter, the general manager of the Buffalo Steel Company, was the head of the committee that "paid for the printing and distribution" of the leaflets. One member of the education committee commented on the matter of buying children to spy on their parents, saying that this tactic helps to create a "super Gestapo state."

    Due to the extensive surveillance and espionage carried out by a large number of FBI agents in various colleges and universities, a atmosphere of terror is enveloping the entire higher education system in the United States. A recent survey conducted by a newspaper in seventy-two institutions of higher learning in New York showed that students and professors alike dared not express their opinions on political issues for fear of retaliation from FBI agents. The survey showed that "students are unwilling to boldly express their opinions on controversial issues in or out of class... unwilling to participate in student political groups... not concerned about humanitarian causes... avoid using any words related to "liberalism," "peace," and "freedom"; female students also dare not advocate humanitarian views, because it is linked to communism." One student who was questioned said: "FBI agents often investigate students' situations."

    On June 20, Yale University philosophy professor Dr. Green testified before a Senate subcommittee that "the fear even prevents professors from teaching some facts about communism. Many people want to hide the fact that they have read Marxist works." Dr. Green said that the current wave of thought control is "fascism."

    The Yale University newspaper *Daily News* commented in an editorial on these police-fascist methods being used in America's top schools, "The sky is getting darker and darker, and with it comes the long night of thought control..."

    ★        ★      ★

    In addition to having many professional agents, the FBI also has hundreds of thousands of paid informers on its list. During the trial of the eleven CPUSA leaders, it brought out seven informers to testify, who were planted in the ranks of the Communist Party by the FBI in advance. These dregs used to spy on the American people are all criminals who have been arrested by the police.

    In this regard, the most representative case is the history of the informer Sivitch. On February 18, 1939, this Sivitch was charged in Pittsburgh with "violent" assault on his great aunt, Anna Bashi. The court had found Sivitch guilty, but the FBI came to his rescue, paid his fine for him, put him on their payroll, and ordered him to "work" within the Communist Party. After a few years, the large enterprises in Pittsburgh felt that the time had come to step up the fight against the growing influence of the Communist Party among the workers, so they brought out their trump card - Sivitch.

    This rogue was immediately praised as a "decent citizen" by the yellow newspapers. He was then invited to Hollywood, where he became the hero of the FBI-produced film *I Was a Communist* (the workers of Pittsburgh boycotted this film and called it *I Was a Communist Working for the FBI*).

    Mr. Truman often expresses the view that there must be "free exchanges" between the nations of the world.

    But in reality, Truman and his police chief Hoover fear free exchanges almost as much as they fear peaceful competition between the two systems. To prevent this free exchange, they will not hesitate to take any means. A typical example of this is the case of Maurice Chevalier. He is a French stage and film star whose beliefs are almost as far from communism as heaven is from earth. But Chevalier was prevented from entering the United States by FBI detectives because American spies in France reported that he had signed the Stockholm Appeal.

    Judging from this example, it is clear that the five hundred million peace supporters who signed the Stockholm Appeal are unwelcome to the likes of Truman, Acheson, and Austin. At the same time, all active peace advocates, including members of the World Peace Council, are denied entry into the United States, and American peace advocates are not allowed by their government to go abroad to attend international conferences.

    The work of framing black people occupies a particularly important position in the FBI's activities. In the book cited earlier, Rowansa wrote that the FBI often sends impostor stenographers to attend black people's meetings, and then, based on the reports sent by these people, declares that "black leaders are conspiring to rebel against the United States government," so "it is even more necessary for national FBI detectives to monitor American blacks."

    According to the New York Times, $725,000 has been allocated to repair four old army barracks as places to imprison American communists.

      ★             ★             ★

    Putting communists, peace advocates, and all true democrats into concentration camps, sending Willie McGee and dozens of innocent black people to the electric chair, this is the true face of America today, the "most progressive country in the world" described by Morgan Phillips, the chairman of the newly formed Socialist International.

    However, concentration camps do not represent strength, but only fear. From the facts cited above (and many more), it can be seen that the rulers of the United States are very afraid of the growing peace sentiment among millions of Americans, and afraid that millions of peace-loving Americans and billions of people outside the United States will together force them to accept the people's demand for peace and end their reckless profiteering from war preparations.

    铁幕后的美国“民主”
    贝林
    一九四七年十月，美国出席联合国大会的首席代表奥斯汀先生，反对苏联所提出的关于谴责战争宣传的议案，用下面的话来总结他庇护煽动战争的自由的冗长言论：“美国代表团反对一切直接或间接限制言论自由的企图”。
    这样看来，在这个大西洋西岸的“民主堡垒”里面，言论自由据说是那样神圣，就连公然主张用原子和细菌战争来消灭千千万万人的疯子们，也保证有演讲、著述和广播的充分自由。
    但是，尽管美国政客们假惺惺地高唱什么“民主自由”，这种“自由”对于主张和平、民主和进步的人是并不存在的。
    大家知道，美国共产党一向是争取和平的斗争的先锋，这个斗争是美国最优秀的人们为反对一小撮原子疯汉而进行的斗争。
    但是，因为共产党的领袖们行使他们的言论自由的权利来揭发战争贩子，他们就被关进监狱里去了。杜鲁门政府对共产党领袖们的公诉，证明了恰恰是因为但尼斯和他的同志们实行了奥斯汀在联合国讲坛上假惺惺宣布的言论自由，他们才坐牢的。公诉文内提出的共产党领袖们的罪状是：其中一个人“曾使一篇文章发表出来”，另一个人“被人看见走出党的机关”，第三个人“在杰佛逊学校教一班学生”，第四个人曾经“从事党的活动”……。
    这些所谓“罪状”是莫须有到那样荒谬的田地，违反言论自由和人权的原则竟昭彰到那样的田地，连最高法院法官道格拉斯也不得不指出：“以合法言论为非法……这就根本离开了过去的道路，违背了我们宪法制度的基本原则”（道格拉斯是最高法院中对原则表示异议的两个法官之一）。
    非法监禁共产党领袖们这件事，为法西斯又一次进攻个人自由，又一次违反美国宪法，大开方便之门。这一次，“罪”人是代被捕的共产党领袖交纳保释金的人。
    联邦法官赖恩已命令“人权大会”对当局说出那些借钱给该会作保释金的公民的姓名，否则人权大会的会员也得坐牢。
    不久以前，法西斯的麦卡伦法的制订者又提了一个修正条文来补充这个黑暗的法律。依据这个“修正”，许多美国进步人士正在受审判，受迫害。它造成了更野蛮的恐怖气氛，宣布一切加入共产党或“共产党外围”组织的人、工会代表或领袖的活动，都是非法的。根据这个“修正”，任何工人如果他参加了司法部名单上所列的任何“颠复性组织”而不肯对当局报告这件事，就可以受到开除的处分。司法部这张名单上面有近一百五十个“颠复性组织”，另外还包括那些主张和平或援助佛朗哥恐怖政权的受难者的组织。
    在这种情形下面，无怪美国的反动报纸正在要求大批逮捕普通的公民了。臭名远扬的流氓文人佩格勒在赫斯脱系报纸《纽约美国人新闻报》（六月二十七日）上写道，有了监禁共产党领袖这个决定，就有可能并且有必要立即把“成千拥护新政的人”（即赞成罗斯福的政策的人——编者）监禁起来，因为“根据这个先例，这些人都犯了与共产党阴谋家同谋不轨的刑事罪”。佩格勒主张对这些拥护新政的人“不必在技术上证明每一个人的叛国罪行”就处以死刑。
    这样，由于反共而造成的无法无天的黑暗统治还要逐渐加以扩大，使成百万美国普通公民遭殃。
    ★      ★      ★
    法西斯进攻美国人民权利的急先锋就是所谓“联邦调查局”这个秘密警察组织。
    联邦调查局是一九○八年成立的，主角是当时总检查官，一位很恰当地叫做波那帕的先生。自从第二次世界大战结束后，联邦调查局就承继了美国“盖世太保”（即秘密警察）的衣钵。它的魔爪伸到了每个工业企业、机关和工会里面，它的特务钻到了教会团体、大小学校、俱乐部、饭馆和理发店里面，同时，偷听电话的工作成了它的主要日常工作。这个只对自己负责的秘密警察机构，每年预算达五千万美元。它有一万一千名以上的专业特务，而根据该局局长胡佛的声明，它的密告系统每一天要交进多到两百个的关于公民个人的报告。
    七月二日，纽约先锋论坛报引了胡佛的话，说该局现在已有一亿一千八百万组以上的指纹记录。在洛杉矶城一地，据当地警察局长贝纳许说“每年有四万个公民的指纹记录下来，我的指纹组每小时可以处理十五到二十组指纹。”
    美国作家罗文萨在他的近著一本描写联邦调查局暗无天日的活动的书中说，在许多行业里面，工人不让雇主纪录他的指纹就找不到工作，然而，在交了指纹纪录之后，如果联邦调查局认为他是个“不稳分子”，他还是找不到工作的。
    下面这个例子是该局在工业中使用的所谓保安方法的典型。不久以前，一个“大克里夫兰防务会议”在沃海沃州克里夫兰城召开，有三百五十名工厂经理参加。会议的讨论中心是“暗害活动”，在讨论之前，表演了爆炸工厂小模型的情形；接着美国钢铁与钢丝公司人事处处长发表了一篇讲演，他告诉听众怎样对付“暗害分子”的方法：应该把每一个工人过去的历史至少纪录其最近的五年；每一个工人都应该留下指纹纪录以便联邦调查局调查；每一个工人应该佩戴特制徽章，并且只准在本部门行动；大家来注意发现并报告任何可以认为是“共产主义的”言论。
    大资本家——联邦调查局的反对美国劳动人民的阴谋还有更阴险的方式，那就是收买学生做特务。纽约州布法罗城的大资本家用典型的“盖世太保”式的方法，散发传单给所有的公立学校学生，要他们向联邦调查局报告“颠覆分子”。在一次区教育当局会议上曾讨论过这个传单，大家发现布法罗炼钢公司总理温特就是“出钱印刷和散发”传单的委员会的头子。一位教育委员会的委员评论收买儿童来刺探父母这件事说：这种策略帮助造成一个“超级盖世太保国家”。
    由于大批联邦调查局的特务在各专科学校、各大学进行广泛的侦察与刺探，以致全美国的高等教育系统笼罩着一种恐怖的气氛。最近一家报纸在纽约七十二个高等学校所进行的一次调查，显示出学生们和教授们都不敢对政治问题表示意见，因为怕联邦调查局的特务报复。从这次调查中可以看出，“学生们不愿意在课内或课外就争论的问题大胆表示意见……不愿意参加学生的政治社团……不关心人道主义的事业……避免用任何与“自由主义”“和平”“自由”有关的字眼；女学生们也不敢主张人道主义的观点，因为它与共产主义被连在一块了”，有一个被问到的学生说：“联邦调查局的特务常常调查学生们的情形。”
    六月二十日耶鲁大学哲学教授格林博士在参院小组委员会作证时说，“恐惧的心理甚至使教授们不敢教关于共产主义的一些事实。很多人想隐瞒他们曾经读过马克思主义的著作”。格林博士说，目前的思想统制浪潮是“法西斯主义”。
    耶鲁大学的报纸《每日新闻》在社论中论到这些警察法西斯方法竟然用于美国的第一流学校时说，“天空越来越黑暗了，随着而来的是思想统制的长夜……”。
  ★        ★      ★
    联邦调查局除了有许多专业特务以外，在它的名单上还有成千上万的雇佣的告密人。在审讯十一位美共领袖期间，它就弄了七个告密人出来作证，这些人是联邦调查局事先安插在共产党的队伍里的。这些用来侦察美国人民的败类都是罪犯，他们都是曾经被警察逮捕过的。
    在这方面，最有代表性的一桩事就是告密人西维铁克的历史。一九三九年二月十八日，这位西维铁克在匹兹堡被控，因为他以“暴力”袭击他的大姨安娜·巴希。法庭已查出西维铁克罪状确凿，但联邦调查局前来救了他，代他付了罚款，把他列入他们的发薪名单上，同时命令他在共产党内部“工作”。过了几年之后，匹兹堡的大企业认为与共产党在工人中的日益增长的势力加紧斗争的时机已到，他们于是拿出了他们的王牌——西维铁克。
    这个无赖立刻就被黄色的报纸誉为“体面的公民”。他接着又被请到好莱坞去了，在那里他成了联邦调查局特制的影片《我做过共产党员》里的英雄（匹兹堡的工人抵制这张影片，并把这张影片叫作《我做过一个为联邦调查局工作的共产党员》）
    杜鲁门先生常常发表意见，认为世界各民族间必须“自由往来”。
    但是实际上，杜鲁门和他的警察头子胡佛怕自由往来几乎与他们怕两个制度和平竞争一样，他们为了阻止这种自由往来，甚至不惜采取任何手段。这方面的典型例子是莫利斯·薛伐利这个案子。他是一个法国的舞台和电影明星，他的信仰与共产主义的距离，几乎像天离地那样远。但薛伐利却被联邦调查局的侦探阻止进入美国，因为美国在法国的间谍报告说，他曾在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签过名。
    从这个例子来判断，很显然，在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的五亿和平拥护者对于杜鲁门、艾奇逊和奥斯汀之流说来，都是不受欢迎的。同时所有积极的和平拥护者，包括世界和平理事会的理事在内，都被拒绝进入美国境内，美国的和平拥护者出国参加国际会议也不为他们的政府所允许。
    陷害黑人的工作在联邦调查局的活动中占着特别重要的地位。在前面所引证的这本书中，罗文萨写道，联邦调查局常常派遣一些冒充的速记员去参加黑人的会议，然后根据这些人送来的报告，宣布说，“黑人领袖阴谋叛乱反对美国政府”，所以“全国联邦调查局的侦探甚至更有必要对美国黑人进行监视”。
    根据纽约时报的消息，已经拨款七十二万五千美元来修葺四个旧军营，作为监禁美国共产党人的地方。
      ★             ★             ★
    把共产党人、和平拥护者以及一切真正的民主分子关进集中营，请威利·麦基和几十个无辜黑人坐电椅，这就是新成立的社会主义国际的主席摩根·菲力浦所描写的“世界上最进步的国家”，今天美国的真面目。
    然而，集中营并不表示力量，只能表示恐惧。从上面所引证的事实（还有许多）可以看出，美国的统治者们很怕千百万美国人民中间滋长着的和平情绪，害怕千百万爱好和平的美国人民和美国以外的亿万人民一同来迫使他们接受人民要求和平的意志，终止他们从战争准备中为所欲为地牟取利润。
