Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: Soviet Marshal Sokolovsky delivered a speech at the commemorative meeting in Sofia celebrating the 7th anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation on the 8th, the abstract is as follows:

    The Soviet delegation, representing the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, and representing the Soviet people, the Soviet army, and Comrade Stalin himself, extends fraternal greetings to the entire Bulgarian people and warmly congratulates Bulgaria on the seventh anniversary of its liberation from the fascist shackles.
    Seven years ago, thanks to the Soviet army's epoch-making victory over fascist Germany, and thanks to the Bulgarian people's armed uprising on September 9, 1944, Bulgaria's history entered a new era.
    The old imperial Bulgaria, and the rule of foreign imperialism, have been thrown into the garbage heap of history. A new people's democratic Bulgaria was born, a regime established by the working class under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party.
    Only seven years have passed since then. In this short period of time, Bulgaria's people's democratic system has been greatly consolidated. With the friendly and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, the new Bulgaria is rapidly advancing along the road of industrialization. The level of industrial production is already more than three times the pre-war level. Bulgaria's countryside is gradually undergoing socialist construction, and the working farmers have learned from their own experience the benefits of collective labor. The working masses of Bulgaria have become masters of their own lives and are actively participating in the country's scientific and cultural life.
    Comrades! The achievements you have made in economic and cultural development provide vivid evidence of the great prospects unfolding before the peoples who have embarked on the road to socialism.
    The Soviet people have deep respect and love for the freedom-loving Bulgarian people. Over the years, the Soviet people and Comrade Stalin himself have been paying close attention to all your achievements with great concern. The Soviet people have helped and will continue to help the fraternal Bulgarian people.
    The friendship between the Soviet and Bulgarian peoples has a long history. Now, the friendship between our two peoples is being strengthened and developed on a new political and social foundation. This friendship is now built on the principles of proletarian internationalism, and on the principles of Lenin-Stalin diplomacy, which advocates equality of rights between large and small countries and respect for national sovereignty.
    Thanks to this cooperation, the friendship between our two peoples is growing and consolidating. In March 1948, this friendly relationship between our two countries was solidified in the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, which is based on the principles of respect for national independence and national sovereignty, and serves the cause of peace and security in Europe.
    The policy of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies is a policy of international peace and sincere cooperation. The policy pursued by the governments of the imperialist countries is completely different; it is a policy of war, arms expansion, and seizure of foreign territories.
    At present, the imperialist camp is stepping up preparations for another war against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The aggressive war of the US-British interventionists against the heroic Korean people has entered its second year. They are barbarously bombing Korean cities and slaughtering peaceful Korean people. Although the US-British imperialists, under the pressure of public opinion, have had to start armistice negotiations, they have been constantly creating shameless provocations to obstruct these negotiations for two months.
    These aggressive and predatory acts of the US-British imperialists have aroused the hatred of the people of Asian countries. After the Chinese people achieved a great epoch-making victory and the People's Republic of China was established, the people of Asia have entered a new era in their history. The era in which the people of Asia were oppressed by the US-British imperialists is gone forever. The defeat of militarist Japan by the Soviet army and the great victory of the Chinese people have created a new situation in Asia. The people of the Soviet Union and China, who account for nearly one-third of the world's total population, have established a great friendship.
    The US imperialists are rearming West Germany and Japan. They are stepping up the organization of the aggressive North Atlantic army.
    In the Balkans, the US imperialists ordered their loyal lackey, Tito, the executioner of the Yugoslav people, to provoke a new war. This imperialist lackey keeps peace-loving neighboring countries in a state of tension, creating conflicts and incidents on the border. There is no doubt that the patience of the Yugoslav people, who are persecuted and plundered by the Tito clique, is reaching its limit.
    Comrades! Faced with such shameless provocations by the arrogant imperialists, the entire peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is more united and demonstrates firmness and tenacity, never relaxes its vigilance, and does everything possible to strengthen the sacred struggle for peace.
    The unity and friendship of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and other people's democracies is the guarantee of our invincibility and strength, and the guarantee that all the malicious plans of the warmongers will not succeed, and their conspiracies and tricks will be shattered in the face of the unity of the people of all countries and the firm will to defend peace.
    Comrades! On this great national day of your country, please allow me, on behalf of all the Soviet people and Soviet soldiers, to wish you complete victory in your struggle for peace, for socialism, and for the happiness and prosperity of the fraternal Bulgarian people.
    (At the end of Marshal Sokolovsky's speech, the entire audience burst into prolonged stormy applause, followed by several minutes of enthusiastic cheers: "Stalin! Stalin is peace!")

    苏联元帅索科洛夫斯基在纪念大会上演说
    【本报讯】据新华社十一日讯：塔斯社索非亚讯：苏联元帅索科洛夫斯基八日在索非亚庆祝保加利亚解放七周年纪念大会上发表演说，摘要如下：
    苏联代表团代表苏联政府和苏联共产党中央委员会，并代表苏联人民、苏联军队和斯大林同志本人，向保加利亚全国人民致兄弟的敬礼，并热烈祝贺保加利亚从法西斯枷锁下获得解放的七周年纪念。
    七年前，由于苏军击败法西斯德国，取得了划时代的胜利，由于一九四四年九月九日保加利亚人民的武装起来，保加利亚的历史从此进入了新的纪元。
    旧的帝制的保加利亚、以及外国帝国主义的统治，已被抛入历史的垃圾堆了。新的人民民主的保加利亚诞生了，这个政权是工人阶级在保加利亚共产党的领导下建立起来的。
    从那时到现在仅仅过了七年。在这段短促的时间内，保加利亚人民民主制度大大地巩固了。在苏联和各人民民主国家友好无私的帮助下，新的保加利亚正在沿着工业化的道路迅速迈进。工业生产的水平已经为战前水平的三倍以上。保加利亚的农村在逐步地进行社会主义建设，劳动农民们已从他们亲身的经验中，懂得了集体劳动的好处。保加利亚的劳动大众，已经成了他们自己的生活的主人，并积极参加着国家的科学与文化生活。
    同志们！你们在经济和文化发展方面所获得的成就提供了生动的证据，证明展开在已经开始走上社会主义道路的各国人民面前的远景是何等的远大。
    苏联人民对爱好自由的保加利亚人民是怀着深切的尊敬和热爱的。这些年来，苏联人民及斯大林同志本人一直以十分关切的心情注视着你们的一切成就。苏联各族人民已经帮助、而且将来还要继续帮助亲如兄弟的保加利亚人民。
    苏联人民和保加利亚人民之间的友谊是有着悠久的历史的。现在，我们两国人民的友谊正在新的政治与社会基础上日益加强与发展着。这种友谊现在建筑在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，建筑在大小国家权利平等，尊重国家主权的列宁—斯大林外交政策原则的基础上。
    由于这种合作，我们两国人民的友谊日益发展和巩固着。一九四八年三月，我们两国的这种友好关系在友好合作互助条约中固定下来了，这个条约是以尊重国家独立与国家主权的原则为基础的，是为欧洲和平与安全事业服务的。
    苏联与人民民主国家的政策是国际和平与真诚合作的政策。帝国主义国家的政府执行的政策就完全不同，那是战争、扩充军备与夺取外国领土的政策。
    目前，帝国主义阵营正在加紧准备另一次反对苏联和人民民主国家的战争。美英干涉者对英勇的朝鲜人民的侵略战争已经进入第二年了。他们野蛮地轰炸朝鲜城市，屠杀和平的朝鲜人民。美英帝国主义者虽在舆论的压力下不得不开始停战谈判，但两月来却不断制造无耻的挑衅来阻挠这种谈判。
    美英帝国主义者这些侵略性的掠夺行动激起了亚洲各国人民的憎恨。在中国人民取得划时代的伟大胜利和中华人民共和国建立以后，亚洲人民已经进入了他们历史的新纪元。亚洲人民被美英帝国主义者压迫的时代是一去不复返了。军国主义日本之被苏军打败和中国人民的伟大胜利，在亚洲造成了一种新的局面。占世界总人口几及三分之一的苏中两国人民建立了伟大的友谊。
    美帝国主义者正在重新武装西德和日本。他们正在加紧组织侵略性的北大西洋军队。
    在巴尔干，美帝国主义者下令给他们的忠实走狗、南斯拉夫人民的刽子手铁托，叫他挑起新的战争。这个帝国主义走狗使爱好和平的邻国处于紧张状态，在边境上制造冲突和事件。毫无疑问，受铁托集团迫害和劫掠的南斯拉夫人民的忍耐是快到最后的限度了。
    同志们！面临着骄横的帝国主义者这种无耻的挑衅，以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营更为团结一致，表现了坚定和顽强，时刻没有松懈自己的警惕，并尽了一切办法加强争取和平的神圣斗争。
    苏联、保加利亚和其他人民民主国家的团结与友好，就是我们的不可战胜和力量的保证，就是战争贩子的一切恶毒计划都不得逞，他们的阴谋诡计都将在各国人民的团结及拥护和平的坚定意志面前碰得粉碎的保证。
    同志们！值此贵国伟大的国庆节，请允许我代表全体苏联人民和苏联军人，祝你们在争取和平、争取社会主义和争取兄弟般的保加利亚人民的幸福与繁荣的斗争中，取得完全的胜利。
    （索科洛夫斯基元帅演说毕，全场响起历久不息的暴风雨般的掌声，接着是数分钟的热烈的欢呼：“斯大林！斯大林就是和平！”）
