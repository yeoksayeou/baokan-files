    The United States Implements a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan and Continues to Disrupt the Kaesong Talks; We Must Make Every Effort to Strengthen the Work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea

    (1) Question: Recently, the United States implemented a separate peace treaty with Japan and continued to disrupt the Kaesong talks. We are very indignant. What active steps should we take?

    Answer: The indignation of the people throughout the country is entirely correct. Because the fundamental purpose of these provocative actions by the U.S. government is to妄想 further侵略 China and once again enslave the Chinese people. Therefore, it is also entirely correct for patriotic people in all regions to demand active actions to oppose U.S. imperialism. And the most effective way to oppose U.S. imperialism is to全力 strengthen the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. The joint declaration commemorating the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan by various democratic parties and people's organizations has already pointed out: "In all current struggles, aiding the just war of resistance against aggression by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has the greatest significance. Only by defeating the aggression of the United States and its vassal states in Korea can we defend the security of our motherland, prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression, liberate Taiwan, and safeguard peace in the Far East. Therefore, all our compatriots throughout the country must do everything in their power, together with the Korean people, to strive for the victorious conclusion of the Korean anti-aggression war through a protracted struggle, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal." The people of our entire country should resolutely implement the call of the joint declaration.

    (2) Question: Why do we say that the fundamental purpose of the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan is to invade China? In this situation, is the main enemy of the Chinese people the Japanese reactionaries, or U.S. imperialism?

    Answer: Supporting the Japanese aggressive forces and rearming Japan is a major link in the U.S. aggression against Asia and the preparation for launching a new war of aggression in the Far East. And the targets of the U.S. aggression and launching of a new war in Asia are China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries. China is the first to bear the brunt. The United States convened an illegal San Francisco conference from September 4th to September 8th, excluding the People's Republic of China, and passed an illegal separate peace treaty with Japan. In this illegal treaty, the United States refused to return Taiwan and the Xisha and Nansha Islands, which belong to China, to China. This shows that the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan is resolutely hostile to the Chinese people. Secondly, the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" and the exchange documents signed by the United States and the Japanese Yoshida government on September 8th stipulate that the United States will station troops in Japan for a long time and force Japan to assist the United States in its armed aggression against Korea and other regions near Japan with "various facilities and labor services." This further proves that the purpose of the United States' indefinite stationing of troops in Japan and the rearmament of Japanese reactionaries is to use Japan's bases, materials, and manpower to invade China and other Asian countries. Again, the United States is now colluding with Japanese reactionaries to continue to support the Kuomintang remnant bandits in Taiwan, dreaming of helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandits "counterattack the mainland." This clearly shows that although U.S. imperialism has been driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people, it is constantly trying to enslave the Chinese people again.

    The illegal peace treaty with Japan and the so-called U.S.-Japan Security Treaty manufactured by the United States are treaties of national subjugation for the Japanese people. Due to the signing of these treaties, the United States has in fact turned the Japanese people into slaves of a conquered nation and also wants to turn the Japanese people into cannon fodder for the United States in its war of aggression in Asia. In addition, the U.S. arming of Japan is also for the purpose of invading the people of other Asian countries, in order to further plunder the colonies and spheres of influence of imperialist countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands in the Far East. All of this proves that U.S. imperialism has now replaced the position of Japanese imperialism before its surrender and has become the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and all Asian people. The Japanese reactionaries are willing to act as the main accomplice of the United States in its aggression against Asia, so they are also the enemy of the Chinese and Asian people, but without the instigation and support of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries cannot be resurrected. They are merely tools of U.S. imperialism, and our primary enemy is of course U.S. imperialism. As for the Japanese people who are enslaved by the United States today, they are friends of the Chinese and Asian people in the common struggle against U.S. aggression. The majority of them are rapidly awakening to fight against U.S. enslavement and to demand Japan's independence, peace, and democracy.

    (3) Question: How has the United States continued to disrupt the Kaesong talks recently?

    Answer: The Korean armistice talks have been going on for seventy days since they began on July 10th, and twenty-seven days have passed since August 23rd when the United States forced the meeting to be interrupted with a provocative action of assassinating our delegation. In the past half-month, the United States has continued to take shameless provocative actions to make it impossible for the talks to resume. First, during this period, the U.S. side not only continued to deny responsibility for the provocative criminal acts of attacking the Kaesong neutral zone and its airspace with ground armed personnel and air force planes, destroying the Kaesong neutralization agreement, and killing and assassinating our personnel, but also put forward an absurd new proposal to move the negotiation site on September 6th. The purpose of the U.S. side in putting forward this absurd new proposal is to evade their responsibility for the provocative assassination acts and to find an excuse for further disrupting the negotiations. Therefore, this absurd demand is not worth serious consideration, and our side has severely criticized it. Second, after the U.S. side put forward the absurd demand to move the meeting site, it actually attacked the area near the negotiation venue for the third time on September 10th with air force planes entering the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone. Third, since the human and physical evidence could no longer be denied, the U.S. side admitted that the shooting of Kaesong on September 10th was done by U.S. planes, but refused to admit that it was intentionally created by the U.S. side, saying that it was caused by the pilot's "navigation error" confusing the target of the attack. At the same time, the U.S. side continued to deny that the previous provocative incidents were done by the U.S. side and continued to refuse to take responsibility for their own despicable and barbaric provocative acts. Another means by which the U.S. side is disrupting the Kaesong talks is to launch a military offensive against our side.

    (4) Question: What are the new developments in the Korean War recently?

    Answer: Because the U.S. "United Nations" invading army continues to invade us, the Korean War has been continuing, and our side continues to inflict significant casualties on the invaders in the defensive war. Since the U.S. side's unreasonable demand in the Kaesong negotiation meeting to push the military demarcation line for the armistice deep into our positions and allow the U.S. side to easily seize 12,000 square kilometers of Korean territory was resolutely rejected by our side, the U.S. side, on the one hand, used the provocative method of destroying the Kaesong neutral zone agreement to disrupt the progress of the armistice negotiations, attempting to force our side to submit; on the other hand, since August 18th, launched a large-scale offensive against our side, attempting to achieve the goal of plundering Korean territory by military means. However, the U.S. side's offensive, like before, suffered a tragic failure, not only failing to achieve the goal of plundering Korean territory, but also suffering a large number of casualties. In the twenty-one days from August 16th to September 5th, our army eliminated a total of more than 31,100 enemy troops, which is almost twice as many as the number of enemies eliminated in the thirty-six days from July 11th to August 15th (calculated as 16,000). From October 25th of last year to September 10th of this year, our army has eliminated a total of more than 317,500 enemy troops (of which more than 122,600 were U.S. troops), and shot down and damaged 1,630 enemy planes. Facts have proved that the Chinese and Korean people not only sincerely advocate a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also have sufficient strength to crush any offensive by the enemy and achieve greater military victories.

    (5) Question: Why does the U.S. side continue to disrupt the Kaesong talks? What is the future of the Korean talks?

    Answer: The purpose of the U.S. side in obstructing and disrupting the Kaesong talks is to create an atmosphere of international tension in order to force its vassal states to sign an illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, to force the U.S. Congress to pass the huge war preparation budget of the U.S. government for the next year, to force the U.S. vassal states to continue to step up arms expansion and war preparation, to force our side to accept the U.S. side's unreasonable demand to plunder Korean territory, and to maintain and expand the staggering war profit income of U.S. big capitalists. Now, although the U.S. side has forced its vassal states to sign the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, and the U.S. Congress (Senate) has also passed the $61 billion military budget for the next year on September 13th, the U.S. side's despicable and barbaric provocative actions cannot force our side to submit. What is particularly important is that the crisis of the U.S. domestic war preparation economy is approaching. In July, the first month of the start of the Korean talks, U.S. industrial production had already begun to decline. According to the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. industrial production index, with 1935 to 1939 as 100, has fallen from 232 in June to 225, which has caused the so-called "peace panic" among U.S. big capitalists. This is the background for the U.S. side to continue to disrupt the Kaesong talks. We must prepare to force the enemy to accept peace by crushing the enemy's offensive in the event that the enemy breaks the negotiations. However, the enemy is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. It is not only afraid that the outcome of the Kaesong talks will promote the realization of lasting peace in the Far East and the world, but also afraid that a long-term Korean war will greatly consume its manpower and resources. In addition, it is also afraid that breaking the negotiations will make it more isolated in the world. It is precisely because the enemy has these fundamental weaknesses that it was forced to agree to hold armistice talks in June this year, and that until now, although it has despicably obstructed and disrupted the progress of the negotiations, it still does not dare to break the negotiations. In view of the fact that the U.S. side has finally expressed regret for the shooting incident on September 10th, General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai have suggested to Ridgway on the 19th to resume negotiations and establish an appropriate mechanism to be responsible for handling the various provocative incidents protested by our side and to stipulate and guarantee the strict agreement on the neutralization of Kaesong. Our side's benevolent and righteous attitude has won good reactions from world opinion. But in any case, even if the Kaesong talks resume and an armistice agreement is reached in the future, the U.S. side will still insist on occupying South Korea and our country's Taiwan and refuse a truly peaceful resolution of the Korean and other Far Eastern issues. The U.S. brazenly disregards the opposition of the people of our country, the Soviet Union, and various Asian countries and implements a separate peace treaty with Japan, which is enough to prove that the United States is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese and all Asian people to the end. Recently resigned U.S. Defense Secretary Marshall said as early as April this year in an interview with "U.S. News & World Report" magazine: "The best future the United States hopes for is long-term tension rather than all-out war," and the United States is "preparing for ten years of tension." And as long as the result of the Korean talks is only an unstable armed truce, the war may break out again at any time. In short, no matter which of the above three possible futures is the future of the Korean talks, we must make every effort to strengthen the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea and use long-term struggle to achieve the goal of defeating the U.S. aggressors.

    (6) Question: How should we strengthen the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea?

    Answer: The most important tasks at present are: First, we must earnestly implement the patriotic increase production and donation plan, pay on time, and strive to complete the donation plan ahead of schedule or overfulfill it; at the same time, we should overcome the unbalanced state of the patriotic donation movement in various regions and units across the country. For this purpose, backward regions and units should learn from advanced regions and units. Second, everyone should attach importance to the patriotic covenant, an important form of long-term patriotic self-education, universally establish and conscientiously implement patriotic covenants, so as to strengthen unity, raise awareness, and promote the accelerated progress of various tasks in our country. All localities should universally launch current affairs propaganda and patriotic education around the National Day to strengthen the practical work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea.

### 美国实行单独对日媾和，继续破坏开城谈判，我们要全力加强抗美援朝工作

专栏：时事问答

    美国实行单独对日媾和，继续破坏开城谈判，我们要全力加强抗美援朝工作
    （一）问：最近美国实行单独对日媾和，继续破坏开城谈判，我们非常愤慨。我们应该怎样积极行动呢？
    答：全国人民的愤慨，是完全正确的。因为美国政府这些挑衅行动的根本目的，就是妄想进一步侵略中国，再来奴役中国人民。所以，各地爱国人民要求采取积极行动来反对美帝国主义，也是完全正确的。而反对美帝国主义的最有效的办法，就是全力加强抗美援朝工作。各民主党派、各人民团体纪念抗日战争胜利六周年联合宣言已经指出：“在当前的一切奋斗中，援助朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的正义的反侵略战争有最伟大的意义。只有击败美国及其仆从国家在朝鲜的侵略，才能保卫祖国的安全，才能防止日本侵略的再起，才能解放台湾，才能维护远东的和平。因此，我全国同胞，必须竭尽全力，和朝鲜人民一道，用长期的奋斗来争取朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利结束，不达目的，誓不休止。”我们全国人民应该坚决执行联合宣言的号召。
    （二）问：为什么说美国单独对日媾和、重新武装日本的根本目的是侵略中国？在这种情形下，中国人民的主要敌人是日本反动派呢，还是美帝国主义呢？
    答：扶植日本侵略力量、重新武装日本，是美国侵略亚洲、准备在远东发动新的侵略战争的主要环节，而美国在亚洲进行侵略和发动新战争的对象，就是中国、苏联和亚洲其他国家，我们中国更是首当其冲。美国在九月四日到九月八日召开了把中华人民共和国排除在外的、非法的旧金山会议，通过了非法的单独对日和约。美国在这个非法和约中拒绝将台湾及属于中国的西沙群岛、南沙群岛等归还中国，这就表明美国单独对日媾和是坚决与中国人民为敌的。其次，美国和日本吉田政府在九月八日签订的“美日安全条约”及换文中，规定美国长期驻军日本，强制日本以“种种设备和劳役”来援助美国对朝鲜及对日本附近其他地区的武装侵略行动。这就更加证明美国无限期驻军日本及重新武装日本反动派的目的，是为了利用日本的基地、物资和人力来侵略中国及亚洲其他国家。再次，美国现在正在勾结日本的反动派，继续扶持在台湾的国民党残余匪帮，梦想帮助蒋匪帮“反攻大陆”。这也清楚地说明美国帝国主义虽然已被中国人民赶出中国大陆，但是它时刻都想再来奴役中国人民。
    美国制造的非法对日和约和所谓美日安全条约，对于日本人民来说，就是亡国条约。由于这些条约的签订，美国已经在实际上把日本人民变成亡国奴，并且还要把日本人民变作美国在亚洲进行侵略战争的炮灰。此外，美国的武装日本，也是为了侵略亚洲其他各国的人民，为了进一步掠夺英、法、荷等帝国主义在远东的殖民地和势力范围。这些都证明美国帝国主义今天已经代替了投降以前的日本帝国主义的地位，变成了中国人民和全亚洲人民的死敌。日本反动派甘愿充当美国侵略亚洲的主要帮凶，所以它也是全中国、全亚洲人民的敌人，但是没有美帝国主义的指使和支持，日本反动派是不可能死灰复燃的，他们只是美帝国主义的工具，我们首要的敌人，当然是美帝国主义。至于今天被美国奴役的日本人民，却是中国和亚洲人民在反对美国侵略的共同斗争中的朋友，他们的大多数正在迅速觉悟起来为反对美国的奴役，为要求日本的独立、和平、民主而斗争。
    （三）问：美国最近是怎样继续破坏开城谈判的？
    答：朝鲜停战谈判自七月十日开始到现在已经过去了七十天的时间，自八月二十三日美国以谋杀我方代表团的挑衅行动迫使会议中断以来，时间也过去了二十七天。最近半个月来，美国仍然继续采取无耻的挑衅行动，使谈判无法恢复进行。第一、美方在这期间不但继续抵赖以地面武装人员及空军飞机袭入开城中立区及其上空，破坏开城中立化协议及杀害和谋杀我方人员的挑衅犯罪行为的责任，而且在九月六日提出了迁移谈判会址的荒谬新建议。美方提出这个荒谬新建议的目的，就是要赖掉他们对挑衅谋杀行为所应负的责任，并为进一步破坏谈判找藉口，因此这种荒谬要求是不值得郑重考虑的，我方已加以痛斥。第二、美方提出迁移会址的荒谬要求之后，竟在九月十日又以空军飞机袭入开城中立区上空，第三次攻击谈判会场附近地区。第三、由于人证物证已无法再事抵赖，美方承认了九月十日扫射开城的事件，是美方飞机所为，但又拒绝承认这是美方有意制造出来的，而说什么是飞行员因“飞航差错”弄错了攻击目标所致。同时，美方又继续否认以前各次挑衅事件是美方所为，继续拒绝担负他们自己这些卑鄙野蛮的挑衅行为的责任。美方破坏开城谈判的另一个手段，就是向我方发动军事攻势。
    （四）问：朝鲜战争最近有什么新发展？
    答：由于美方“联合国”侵略军继续向我进犯，朝鲜战争一直在继续进行，我方在阻击战中继续给予侵略者以重大的杀伤。自美方在开城谈判会议中所提出的要求将停战军事分界线深入我方阵地之内，并使美方垂手取得一万二千方公里的朝鲜领土的无理要求被我方坚决拒绝之后，美方就一方面以破坏开城中立区协议的挑衅办法来破坏停战谈判的进行，企图迫使我方屈服；另一方面，自八月十八日起向我方发动了大规模的进攻，企图以军事方法达到掠夺朝鲜领土的目的。但是美方的进攻和以前一样受到了悲惨的失败，不但并未达到掠夺朝鲜领土的目的，而且遭受了大量的杀伤。自八月十六日到九月五日的二十一天之内，我军总共歼灭了敌军三万一千一百余名，比七月十一日到八月十五日止三十六天内歼灭敌人的数字（计为一万六千名）还几乎多出一倍。自去年十月二十五日到今年九月十日为止，我军总共已消灭了敌军三十一万七千五百余名（其中美军占十二万二千六百名以上），并打落打伤了敌军飞机一千六百三十架。事实证明，中朝人民不但真诚主张朝鲜问题的和平解决，而且也有充分的力量来粉碎敌人的任何进攻而取得更大的军事胜利。
    （五）问：美方为什么要继续破坏开城谈判？朝
    鲜谈判的前途怎样？
    答：美方阻挠和破坏开城谈判的目的是为了造成国际间的紧张气氛，以便迫使它的仆从国家签订非法的单独对日和约，迫使美国国会通过下年度美国政府的庞大备战预算，迫使美国的仆从国继续加紧扩军备战，是为了迫使我方接受美方掠夺朝鲜领土的无理要求，是为了保持和扩大美国大资本家的惊人的战争利润收入。现在虽然美方已经强制它的仆从国家签订了非法的单独对日和约，美国国会（参议院）也已经在九月十三日通过了六百一十亿美元的下年度军事预算，但是美方卑鄙野蛮的挑衅行为，并不能迫使我方屈服。特别重要的是：美国国内备战经济的危机已经迫近，七月份，即朝鲜谈判开始的第一个月，美国的工业生产已开始下降。据美国联邦储备局发表，以一九三五年到一九三九年为一○○的美国工业生产指数已由六月份的二三二降为二二五，这就使美国大资本家发生了所谓“和平的恐慌”。这就是美国继续破坏开城谈判的背景。我们要准备在敌人破裂谈判的情况下以粉碎敌人的进攻来迫使敌人接受和平。但是敌人是外强中干的，它不但害怕开城谈判的结果会促进远东和世界的持久和平的实现，而且害怕朝鲜战争长期打下去会大大消耗它的人力和资源，此外它也害怕破裂谈判会使它自己在全世界更加孤立；正因为敌人有这些根本弱点，它才在今年六月间被迫同意举行停战谈判，而且到现在为止，虽然它卑鄙地阻挠和破坏谈判的进行，它仍然不敢破裂谈判。鉴于美方终究已对九月十日的扫射事件表示遗憾，金日成将军和彭德怀将军已于十九日向李奇微建议恢复谈判，并设立一适当机构来负责处理我方所抗议的各次挑衅事件，并规定和保证开城中立化的严格协议。我方这种仁至义尽的态度，已获得全世界舆论的良好反应。但是无论如何，即使开城谈判恢复，并在将来达成停战协议，美方仍将坚持霸占南朝鲜和我国的台湾，而拒绝朝鲜及其他远东问题的真正和平解决。美国悍然不顾我国、苏联及亚洲各国家人民的反对，实行单独对日媾和，就足以证明美国是决心与中国及全亚洲人民为敌到底的。最近辞职的美国国防部长马歇尔早在今年四月间对“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志谈话时就说过：“美国所希望的最好的前途是长期的紧张而不是全面的战争”，美国“准备十年紧张”。而只要朝鲜谈判的结果仅仅是一个不稳定的武装停战，战争就随时有可能重新爆发。总之，无论朝鲜谈判的前途是上述三种可能前途中的那一种，我们都必须全力加强抗美援朝的工作，用长期的奋斗来达到打败美国侵略者的目的。
    （六）问：我们应该怎样加强抗美援朝工作？
    答：目前最重要的任务，就是：第一，要认真执行爱国增产捐献计划，如期交款，并争取提前或超额完成捐献计划；同时，应该克服爱国捐献运动在全国各地区各单位之间的不平衡状态，为此目的，落后的地区和单位就要向先进的地区和单位看齐。第二，大家都要重视爱国公约这个长期进行爱国主义的自我教育的重要形式，普遍订立和认真执行爱国公约，以便加强团结，提高觉悟，推动我们国家各种工作的加速前进。各地都应在国庆节前后，普遍展开时事宣传和爱国教育，借以加强抗美援朝的各项实际工作。
