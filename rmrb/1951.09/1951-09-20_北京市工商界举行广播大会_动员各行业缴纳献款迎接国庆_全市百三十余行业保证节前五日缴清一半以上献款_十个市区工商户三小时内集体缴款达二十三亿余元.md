Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Beijing industrial and commercial circles held a radio rally at 3 p.m. today to welcome National Day and strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The central venue was set up at Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, and 136 industries in the city and eight branch associations of the suburban Federation of Industry and Commerce organized listening, with a preliminary estimate of more than 238,000 listeners.

At the meeting, Fu Huating, chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, reported on the work of increasing production and donation in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles. He pointed out that the US imperialism's destruction of the Korean armistice talks and the illegal signing of the unilateral Japanese peace treaty aroused the indignation of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles. Everyone enthusiastically donated, in addition to the original donation of 31 aircraft, they also pledged to donate nine more aircraft, as a gift to welcome National Day. He called on the city's industrial and commercial circles to complete more than one-half of the total amount of donations before National Day, and to over fulfill all payments before the end of November. Pu Jiexiu, vice chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, called on the city's industrial and commercial circles to further improve their business on the basis of increasing production and donation, do a good job in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and actively participate in the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition. Subsequently, 17 representatives from 15 industries such as the construction industry, suburban representatives, and stall representatives reported on their experience in increasing production and donation, put forward plans to pay donations in advance, and challenged the city's industrial and commercial circles to a competition. The directors of the first, second, and fifth district offices of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce immediately responded to the call and guaranteed to pay on time. The city's industrial and commercial circles all enthusiastically responded to the call of the conference. During the meeting, response letters and telephone calls were received from 136 industries and 12,632 households in the city's industrial and commercial circles. They all guaranteed to pay more than one-half of the donations five days before National Day, and some industrial and commercial households guaranteed to pay all of them. After hearing the call of the conference, industrial and commercial households in ten urban districts lined up and set off to the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China to pay collectively. Within three hours, the amount paid reached 2,362,950,000 yuan.

At the end of the meeting, a letter was passed to Chairman Mao to express respect, and letters of respect were also passed to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai and the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

The meeting ended at 5 o'clock.
