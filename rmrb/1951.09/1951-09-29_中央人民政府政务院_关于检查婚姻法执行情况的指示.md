The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is one of the major national laws promulgated by the Central People's Government after its establishment. The promulgation and implementation of this national law is a significant social reform for the Chinese people to further eliminate feudal remnants and establish a new social life after winning the victory of the revolutionary war and carrying out land reform on a national scale. Since its promulgation and implementation, this national law has been supported by the broad masses of the people and has shown remarkable achievements. The old family system of feudal oppression is gradually being changed, and new families of equality and harmony are constantly emerging. A large number of men and women in New China, especially women who have been deeply oppressed by the feudal system, have gained the rights of freedom of marriage and equality between men and women, and thus have more actively participated in various political activities and construction undertakings of the new society.

However, because Chinese society has been under the long-term rule of feudalism, although the land reform movement has fundamentally destroyed the feudal system from the economic foundation, the remnants of feudal ideology and the feudal marriage system still have a deep and solid influence not only among some people, but even among many cadres. According to reports from various sources, people with feudal ideas in many places continue to interfere with the freedom of marriage of men and women, abuse women and children, and engage in other illegal acts, while some cadres turn a blind eye to such illegal acts, or even intentionally condone and protect them, and even commit illegal acts of directly interfering with the freedom of marriage of men and women themselves, causing those who are interfered with and abused to not receive the legal and factual protection they deserve. Therefore, arranged, forced, and mercenary marriages still exist in large numbers in many places, especially in rural areas. Crimes of interfering with the freedom of marriage and infringing upon women's rights occur from time to time, even to the extent of persecuting women's lives, resulting in many women across the country being killed or committing suicide due to marriage problems. According to incomplete statistics, the number of women in various places who committed suicide or were killed due to not being able to control their own marriage and being abused by their families was more than 10,000 in the Central and Southern District in the past year, 1,245 in Shandong Province in the past year, and 119 in the nine counties of the Huaiyin Prefecture in northern Jiangsu from May to August 1950. These figures must arouse serious vigilance from governments at all levels. Governments at all levels absolutely should not tolerate this serious situation.

In recent months, the East China Military and Political Committee, the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, and some provincial (municipal) people's governments have successively issued instructions on implementing the Marriage Law. It is absolutely necessary to deal with and correct the above-mentioned illegal phenomena. However, in a society like China, which has been under long-term feudal rule, the implementation of the Marriage Law is an arduous social reform work that must be carried out through constant and systematic ideological and legal struggles. To this end, governments at all levels must, on the one hand, regard the implementation of the Marriage Law and the ideological education of cadres and the people as a regular and major political task for a considerable period of time, and lead judicial, civil affairs, public security, and cultural and educational organs to cooperate with various democratic parties and people's organizations to carry out this task in conjunction with the central tasks of local land reform and democratic political construction as much as possible; on the other hand, they must take serious legal measures to punish serious crimes of harming, abusing, killing, or forcing women to commit suicide due to interference with the freedom of marriage. Governments at all levels should immediately conduct inspections of such cases of harming, abusing, killing, or forcing women to commit suicide that have already occurred. If there are any errors in those who have been sentenced, they should be investigated and dealt with according to law. Those that have not been handled must be strictly investigated and punished according to law, so that every criminal receives the punishment they deserve. Cadres who condone or protect criminals, or who interfere with the freedom of marriage of men and women, thereby contributing to the killing or suicide of women, should be given appropriate punishment according to the severity of their responsibility. In the future, if any woman is killed or commits suicide due to not receiving the rights and protection granted by the Marriage Law due to marriage problems, the main cadres at the district, township (village), and street levels should first bear certain responsibilities.

In order to ensure the correct implementation and enforcement of the Marriage Law, governments at all levels should first educate cadres, especially cadres at the district, township (village), and street levels and judicial cadres, to conscientiously study the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China. Judicial organs and marriage registration organs at all levels must be serious and responsible when handling marriage cases, abide by the provisions of the Marriage Law, and should strengthen the publicity of the Marriage Law through specific cases, criticize the irrationality of the feudal marriage system, commend typical examples of handling marriage cases in accordance with the Marriage Law, and establish a new atmosphere of the new democratic marriage system among the people, while for serious cases with educational significance, public trials should be held among the masses after full preparation, so as to correctly and comprehensively educate cadres and educate the people. At the same time, every cadre of governments at all levels, the People's Liberation Army, various democratic parties, and people's organizations should realize that: whether they can conscientiously and resolutely implement the Marriage Law; whether they can take a serious, prudent, and responsible attitude to solve marriage cases and protect the legitimate interests of women; whether they can actively support the just struggle of the masses (especially the oppressed women) against the feudal marriage system and against feudal ideas; whether they can set an example in abiding by the Marriage Law when dealing with their own marriage problems; these are all serious tests of whether they are willing to thoroughly oppose feudalism politically, and also a serious test of whether they can strictly abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government.

After this instruction is issued, the local people's governments above the provincial (municipal, administrative office) level should immediately urge their subordinate judicial, civil affairs, public security, and cultural and educational departments and invite the participation of consultative organs, various democratic parties, and people's organizations to organize an inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law in a guided and focused manner, take effective measures to promote achievements, correct shortcomings, and investigate and deal with serious illegal cases of killing women or forcing women to commit suicide. The people's governments of each province and city should submit a special report on the results of this inspection to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government before the end of December. This year, people's representative conferences and their consultative committees or standing committees at all levels must conduct a report and discussion on the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law when they meet, and report the results of the discussion to the higher levels.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示
    中华人民共和国婚姻法是中央人民政府成立后公布的国家大法之一。这一国家大法的公布施行是中国人民在赢得革命战争胜利之后，和全国范围进行土地改革的同时，进一步肃清封建残余和建立新的社会生活的重大的社会改革。这一国家大法公布施行之后，已经获得广大人民的拥护，并表现了显著的成绩。封建压迫的旧家庭制度正在逐渐变革，平等和睦的新家庭正在不断产生。大批新中国的男女，特别是深受封建制度压迫的妇女群众，得到了婚姻自由和男女平等的权利，因而更积极地参加了新社会的各种政治活动和各种建设事业。
    但是，由于中国社会曾经长期地受着封建主义的统治，虽然土地改革运动已经或正在从经济基础上给封建制度以根本的摧毁，而封建思想和封建婚姻制度的残余，不仅在一部分人民中，甚至在不少的干部中，依然留有深固的影响。根据各方面的报告，许多地方带有封建思想的人仍有继续干涉男女婚姻自由、虐待妇女和虐待子女等非法行为，而一部分干部竟对此种非法行为采取袖手旁观的态度，或且有意予以宽纵、袒护，甚至他们本身也作出直接干涉男女婚姻自由的非法行为，致使被干涉者和被虐待者得不到法律上和事实上应有的保护。因此，包办、强迫与买卖婚姻，在许多地方，特别在农村中，仍然大量存在。干涉婚姻自由与侵害妇女人权的罪行，时有发生，甚至严重到迫害妇女的生命，致使全国各地有不少妇女因婚姻问题而被杀或自杀。据不完全的统计，各地妇女因婚姻不能自主受家庭虐待而自杀和被杀的，中南区一年来有一万多人，山东省一年来有一千二百四十五人，苏北淮阴专区九个县在一九五零年五月到八月间有一百一十九人。这些数字必须引起各级人民政府严重的警惕。各级人民政府对此严重情形绝对不应容忍。
    最近几个月，华东军政委员会、中南军政委员会和有些省（市）人民政府已先后发布了贯彻执行婚姻法的指示。对于上述违法现象加以处理和纠正，这是十分必要的。但在中国这样一个曾受长期封建主义统治的社会中，婚姻法的执行，是一件艰巨的社会改革工作，必须经过经常的有系统的思想斗争和法律斗争才能贯彻。为此，各级人民政府一方面必须把贯彻婚姻法的执行和对于干部与人民的思想教育，当作相当长时期内经常的重大政治任务，并领导司法、民政、公安、文教等机关并与各民主党派、各人民团体通力合作，尽可能结合当地土地改革、民主建政等中心工作切实进行；另方面，必须对于因干涉婚姻自由而伤害、虐杀妇女或逼致妇女自杀的严重罪行，采取严肃的法律手段，予以制裁。各级人民政府对于这种已经发生的伤害、虐杀妇女或逼致妇女自杀的案件，应即进行检查。已判者，如有错误，应予查明，依法处理，未办者，必须严加追究，依法制裁，务使每个犯罪者都受到应有的惩处。干部中如有宽纵、袒护罪犯，或干涉男女婚姻自由因而促成妇女被杀或自杀者，应按责任轻重，予以应得的处分。今后如有妇女因婚姻问题得不到婚姻法所赋予的权利与保护而被杀或自杀者，区、乡（村）街级的主要干部，首先应负一定责任。
    为了保证婚姻法的正确执行与贯彻，各级人民政府首先应教育干部，尤其是区、乡（村）街级干部和司法干部，认真地学习中华人民共和国婚姻法。各级司法机关与婚姻登记机关在处理婚姻事件时，必须严肃负责，遵守婚姻法的规定，并应通过具体事例，加强对婚姻法的宣传，批判封建主义婚姻制度的不合理，表扬按照婚姻法处理婚姻事件的典型例证，在人民中树立新民主主义婚姻制度的新风气，而对于有教育意义的严重案件，则应在群众中进行充分的准备工作后举行公审，以便正确而全面地教育干部和教育人民。同时，各级人民政府、人民解放军、各民主党派和各人民团体的每个干部都应认识到：能否认真坚决地执行婚姻法；能否采取严肃慎重负责的态度解决婚姻案件，保护妇女的合法利益；能否积极支持群众（特别是被压迫的妇女群众），反对封建婚姻制度和反对封建思想的正义斗争；能否在处理自己本身的婚姻问题时以身作则地遵守婚姻法；这些，都是自己在政治上是否愿意彻底反对封建主义的严重考验，也是能否严格地遵守人民政府法令的严重考验。
    本指示下达后，省（市、行署）以上各地方人民政府应即督促所属司法、民政、公安、文教等部门并邀请协商机关及各民主党派和各人民团体参加，有领导、有重点地组织一次关于婚姻法执行情况的检查，采取有效办法发扬成绩，纠正缺点，并查处杀害妇女或逼致妇女自杀的严重违法的案件。各省、市人民政府应将此项检查结果于十二月底以前向中央人民政府政务院作专题报告。本年内各级人民代表会议及其协商委员会或常务委员会在开会时，必须进行一次关于婚姻法的宣传和执行情况的报告和讨论，并将讨论结果按级上报。			总理  周恩来 		一九五一年九月二十六日
