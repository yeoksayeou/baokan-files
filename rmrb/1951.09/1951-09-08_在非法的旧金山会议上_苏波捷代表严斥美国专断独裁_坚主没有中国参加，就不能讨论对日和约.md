Xinhua News Agency, September 7th (TASS, San Francisco, September 7th): The first plenary session of the illegal San Francisco Peace Conference was held on September 5th. The meeting discussed the issue of adopting the conference's rules of procedure.

US Secretary of State Acheson, in his opening address, made it clear that the United States intended to force the conference to accept the US-drafted peace treaty with Japan. He asserted that the conference was convened to sign a peace treaty with Japan, not to discuss or amend the US draft treaty.

According to Acheson, the only reason for convening the conference was that some delegations expressed their desire to make statements on the peace treaty with Japan and their desire to achieve peace.

Subsequently, the representatives of New Zealand and Cuba formally proposed the adoption of the rules of procedure formulated by the US and British delegations.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, took the stage and made a special statement, proposing that the government of the People's Republic of China be invited to participate in the conference.

In presenting this proposal, Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation, based on indisputable facts, believes that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal representative of the Chinese people and is particularly deeply concerned with the preparation of a peace treaty with Japan and the establishment of lasting peace in the Far East.

For many years, China suffered barbaric aggression from imperialist Japan and waged a sustained and arduous war against Japanese imperialism. It suffered the greatest sacrifices due to Japanese aggression. The Chinese people independently waged a long-term struggle against the Japanese occupation forces that invaded their territory.

Furthermore, as is well known, China was one of the main participants in the international agreements concluded by the Allies during World War II regarding the conduct of the war and the post-war settlement of the Japanese question.

All of this proves the fact that the People's Republic of China has the indisputable right to participate in the peace negotiations with Japan, to participate in the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan; and that without China's participation, a peace treaty with Japan cannot be discussed, let alone concluded.

The government of the People's Republic of China, in its statements issued on May 22nd and August 15th of this year, confirmed that it has the legitimate right to prepare and conclude a peace treaty with Japan and has a special interest in this regard, which other countries cannot but take into account. The Soviet government, in its memorandum of May 7, 1951, and its note to the US government of June 10 regarding the US draft peace treaty with Japan, pointed out that it is impermissible and illegal not to allow the government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet government insists on its position that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to establish lasting peace in the Far East.

Based on what has been said before, the Soviet delegation recommends that an invitation be extended to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, inviting them to send a delegation to participate in the current conference.

The Soviet representative emphasized that this proposal must be discussed before the rules of procedure are adopted, because this proposal relates to the composition of the conference.

However, Acheson, using his position as chairman, insisted that the conference could not discuss the Soviet delegation's proposal because the conference was currently discussing the rules of procedure.

The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Sekaninová, opposed the chairman's ruling. She strongly supported the Soviet delegation's proposal to invite a representative of the government of the People's Republic of China to attend the conference.

At this point, Gromyko spoke again, protesting the chairman's ruling and pointing out that the question of inviting a representative of the government of the People's Republic of China involves the question of the composition of the conference, and this question must be resolved first.

The Polish representative, Wierblowski, firmly protested the chairman's ruling, and his speaking time was illegally limited by Acheson to no more than five minutes.

Wierblowski pointed out that the chairman's ruling once again proves that the United States is intent on preventing the representatives of the great Chinese people from participating in the conference, the Chinese people who fought the Japanese aggressors for fourteen years – a war that was underway long before the Japanese-American war began. Wierblowski supported the Soviet delegation's proposal.

After a brief speech by the British representative, Younger, in support of the chairman's ruling, a compliant majority at the meeting approved Acheson's ruling against the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.

After the vote, Gromyko stated that, since the majority of the conference refused to immediately discuss the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the conference, the Soviet delegation reserves the right to raise its proposal as the first issue after the rules of procedure are adopted.

Then, the conference began to discuss the issue of the conference's rules of procedure.

The head of the Polish delegation, Wierblowski, emphasized the necessity of careful preparation of the rules of procedure and proposed the establishment of a committee to draft the rules of procedure, and stipulated that the committee must submit its recommendations by September 6th.

The Soviet chief representative, Gromyko, seconded the Polish delegation's motion. However, Acheson once again acted completely unreasonably and ruled that the Polish delegation's motion would only be put to a vote after the draft rules of procedure proposed by the US and British delegations had been voted on.

Gromyko opposed the chairman's illegal ruling. Speaking about the US-British draft rules of procedure, he said that this draft restricts the number of times each delegation can speak and limits the speaking time of speakers. Therefore, these rules under discussion are unacceptable because they are not commensurate with the importance and complexity of the issues being discussed at the conference. Everyone knows that the conference must discuss and resolve many complex political, territorial, military, and economic issues related to the peace treaty with Japan. The task of the conference is to seek a solution to these problems, a solution that should satisfy the countries concerned to the greatest extent possible and establish lasting peace in the Far East. The proposed draft rules of procedure contradict this fundamental issue of the conference.

Gromyko said that the US government's claim that the draft peace treaty with Japan submitted to this conference for review takes into account the views of all relevant governments does not correspond to reality. Several countries concerned about the peace treaty with Japan, such as India and Burma, refused to participate in the conference precisely because their views were not taken into account in the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan. The largest country in Asia, which suffered the most from Japanese aggression, did not participate in the preliminary consultations on the draft peace treaty with Japan at all. As for the Soviet Union, it is generally known that none of its views and suggestions were adopted in the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan.

The restrictions on the rights of national delegations stipulated in the draft rules of procedure are unprecedented in any international conference. The Soviet delegation believes that the drafters of this draft rules of procedure submitted it to the current conference with the intention of degrading the significance of the conference, attempting to deprive the countries attending the conference of the basic rights recognized by international practice.

Gromyko proposed some amendments, the purpose of which was to make the rules of procedure conform to the basic standards of international conference practice.

The representative of Ceylon spoke, urging national representatives to accept the US-British draft rules of procedure without alteration. After this, Wierblowski rose to speak. He pointed out that the draft rules of procedure formulated by the US and British delegations violate international conference practice and are intended to deprive the opportunity for free discussion.

The Polish delegation firmly protested this attempt to impose the will of one country on an international conference. He continued: The United States is systematically undermining sovereign independent states and wants to be dictatorial and tyrannical in international conferences.

Wierblowski pointed out the danger of this practice and urged national representatives to pass the Soviet delegation's recommendation.

The Czechoslovak representative suggested the establishment of three committees – political, economic and military – in order to thoroughly study the political, economic and military issues of the peace treaty with Japan. In addition, a comprehensive committee should be established to report to the conference on the results of the work of the aforementioned committees. Czechoslovakia's motion was seconded by the Soviet Union and Poland.

Acheson hurriedly activated the voting machine, the foundation of which was composed of the Latin American puppet states and the Western European Marshallized countries of the United States. This voting machine rejected the Soviet delegation's amendments to the US-British draft rules of procedure. When voting on the Soviet proposals one by one, representatives of all the Latin American countries and Western European Marshallized vassal states attending the conference voted against them. When voting on the Soviet proposals, representatives of several Asian and Arab countries often abstained. Representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor of the Soviet proposals.

Czechoslovakia's proposal to establish four committees and Poland's proposal to establish a special committee to formulate rules of procedure were also rejected. The joint proposal by New Zealand and Cuba to adopt the US-British draft rules of procedure formulated by the US and British without alteration was passed.

After the rules of procedure were adopted, Gromyko immediately raised the issue of inviting a delegation from the People's Republic of China to attend the conference again. However, Chairman Acheson once again refused to put the Soviet delegation's proposal to a vote. This time, his excuse was that the Soviet representative's proposal contradicted the rules of procedure that had just been passed.

The delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia protested the chairman's illegal ruling. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against the chairman's ruling, and the delegations of Indonesia and Lebanon abstained.

Acheson was elected chairman of the conference by secret ballot, and Australian representative Spender was elected vice-chairman.

The morning session ended here.

At the afternoon session, US representative Dulles and British representative Younger, in their speeches, praised the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan and asked the representatives not to delay signing.

Representatives of Mexico and the Dominican Republic spoke in favor of the draft treaty.

At the evening session, representatives of Chile and Bolivia spoke, and they also supported the draft.

    在非法的旧金山会议上
    苏波捷代表严斥美国专断独裁
    坚主没有中国参加，就不能讨论对日和约
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社旧金山七日讯：对日和约会议第一次全体会议于九月五日举行。会上讨论了通过会议议事规则的问题。
    美国国务卿艾奇逊在致开幕辞时明白表示：美国企图强迫会议接受美制对日和约草案。他肯定地说：会议的召集是为了签订对日和约，而不是为了讨论或修正美国的和约草案。
    据艾奇逊说，召开会议的唯一原因是：某些代表团表示希望就对日和约以及他们想要获得和平的愿望发表声明。
    继起发言的新西兰和古巴的代表，正式建议通过美国和英国代表团所制订的议事规则。
    苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯登台发表特别声明，建议邀请中华人民共和国政府参加会议。
    葛罗米柯在提出这个建议时说：苏联代表团根据无可争辩的事实，认为中华人民共和国政府是中国人民唯一的合法代表，与准备对日和约以及建立远东持久和平，关系特别深切。
    在许多年的过程中，中国遭受帝国主义日本的野蛮侵略，曾对日本帝国主义进行了持久的艰苦的战争，它因日本的侵略而遭受的牺牲也最大。中国人民对于侵略他们领土的日本占领军独力进行了长期的斗争。
    此外，如所周知，中国是第二次世界大战期间同盟国所缔结的关于进行战争和战后解决日本问题的国际协议的主要参加者之一。
    所有这一切都证明了一个事实：中华人民共和国有无可争辩的权利参加对日媾和，参加准备和缔结对日和约；并且，没有中国参加，就不能讨论对日和约，当然更不能缔结对日和约。
    中华人民共和国政府在它今年五月二十二日和八月十五日发表的声明里，证实它有准备和缔结对日和约的合法权利，并在这方面有特殊的利害关系，其他国家不能不予以考虑。苏联政府在一九五一年五月七日的意见书和六月十日就美国对日和约草案致美国政府的照会里，都指出不让中华人民共和国政府参加准备和缔结对日和约是不能容许的，也是不合法的。苏联政府坚持它的立场，认为没有中华人民共和国参加，要在远东建立持久和平是不可能的。
    根据以前所说，苏联代表团建议向中华人民共和国中央人民政府发出请柬，邀请他们派代表团来参加目前这个会议。
    苏联代表着重指出：必须在通过议事规则之前讨论这个建议，因为这个建议与会议的成分有关。
    然而艾奇逊利用他的主席的地位，硬说会议不能讨论苏联代表团的建议，因为会议现在讨论的是议事规则的问题。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃反对主席的裁决。她坚决支持苏联代表团邀请中华人民共和国政府派代表出席会议的建议。
    这时，葛罗米柯再度发言，他对主席的裁决提出抗议，并指出：邀请中华人民共和国政府代表的问题牵涉会议的成分问题，这个问题必须首先得到解决。
    波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基坚决抗议主席的裁决，他发言的时间被艾奇逊非法地限制不得超过五分钟。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基指出：主席的裁决再度证明了美国有心不让伟大的中国人民的代表参加会议，而中国人民曾对日本侵略者进行了十四年的战争——这个战争早在日美战争开始之前即在进行着。威尔勃洛夫斯基支持苏联代表团的建议。
    在英国代表杨格发表简短演说支持主席的裁决之后，会议上顺从的多数通过了艾奇逊对苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的裁决。
    表决后，葛罗米柯声明：由于会议的多数拒绝了立即讨论苏联所提的邀请中华人民共和国代表出席会议的建议，苏联代表团保留它在议事规则通过后将它的建议作为第一个问题提出来的权利。
    然后，会议就开始讨论会议议事规则问题。
    波兰代表团团长威尔勃洛夫斯基强调会议有仔细准备议事规则的必要，并提议成立一个草拟议事规则的委员会，并且规定该委员会须在九月六日前提出它的建议。
    苏联首席代表葛罗米柯附议波兰代表团的动议。可是艾奇逊却再次完全不讲道理，他裁决说：只有在表决了美国和英国代表团提出的议事规则草案之后，才把波兰代表团的动议付诸表决。
    葛罗米柯反对主席这个非法的裁决。他谈到美英的议事规则草案说：这个草案限制每一个代表团的发言次数，限制发言者的发言时间，因此讨论中的这个规则是不能接受的，因为它们和会上所讨论的问题的重要性和复杂性是不相符的。谁都知道，会议必须讨论和解决许多与对日和约有关的复杂的政治、领土、军事和经济问题。会议的任务是求得这些问题的解决，这种解决要尽最大程度满足有关的国家，并确立远东的持久和平。而被提出来的这个议事规则草案，是与会议的这个基本问题相矛盾的。
    葛罗米柯说：美国政府硬说，提交这次会议审议的对日和约草案考虑了各有关政府的意见，这种说法是不符合实际情况的。若干关怀对日和约的国家，如印度、缅甸等等，所以拒绝参加会议，正是因为它们的意见在美英的对日和约草案中并未加以考虑。受日本侵略之害最深的亚洲第一大国，完全没有参与对日和约草案的初步协商。至于苏联，一般都知道，它的意见和建议，没有一条被美英的对日和约草案所采纳。
    议事规则草案所规定的对各国代表团权利的限制，是任何国际会议上不曾有过的，是前无先例的。苏联代表团认为：这个草案的制订者向目前的会议提出这样的议事规则草案，用意是要贬低这个会议的意义，企图剥夺出席会议国家的国际惯例所公认的基本权利。
    葛罗米柯提出一些修正案，目的是要使议事规则符合国际会议惯例的基本标准。
    锡兰代表发言，敦促各国代表原封不动地接受美英的议事规则草案。在这以后，威尔勃洛夫斯基起立发言。他指出：美英代表团所制订的议事规则草案，违反国际会议惯例，目的是要剥夺自由讨论的机会。
    波兰代表团坚决抗议这种把一国的意旨强加于国际会议的企图。他继续说：美国有系统地破坏主权独立的国家，要想在国际会议上专断独裁。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基指出这种做法的危险，并敦促各国代表通过苏联代表团的建议。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表建议：成立政治、经济和军事三个委员会，以便详尽研究对日和约的政治、经济和军事问题，此外并成立综合委员会，就上述各委员会的工作结果向大会作报告。捷克斯洛伐克的动议获得苏联和波兰的附议。
    艾奇逊急忙开动表决机器，这个机器的基础是由美国的拉丁美洲傀儡国家和西欧马歇尔化国家组成的。这个表决机器否决了苏联代表团对美英议事规则草案所作的修正。在就苏联提案进行逐项表决时，出席会议的全体拉丁美洲国家和西欧马歇尔化附庸国的代表都投票反对。在表决苏联提案时，若干亚洲和阿拉伯国家的代表时常弃权。苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团投票赞成苏联提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克所提成立四个委员会的提案及波兰所提成立一个特别委员会以制订议事规则的提案也被否决。新西兰和古巴所提原封不动地通过美英两国所制订的美英议事规则草案的联合提案被通过。
    在通过议事规则以后，葛罗米柯紧跟着再次提出邀请中华人民共和国代表团出席会议的问题。但是，主席艾奇逊再次拒绝把苏联代表团的这个提案付诸表决。这一次，他的藉口是硬说苏联代表的提案和刚刚通过的议事规则相抵触。
    苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克三国代表团就主席这一非法裁决提出抗议。苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克三国代表团投票反对主席的裁决，印尼和黎巴嫩的代表团弃权。
    艾奇逊以秘密投票的方式当选为会议主席，澳大利亚代表斯宾德当选为副主席。
    上午会议至此结束。
    在下午的会议上，美国代表杜勒斯和英国代表杨格在发言时称赞美英对日和约草案，并要求代表们不要拖延签字。
    墨西哥和多米尼加共和国的代表发言赞成这个和约草案。
    在晚间的会议上，智利与玻利维亚的代表发言，他们也支持这个草案。
