Xinhua News Agency, September 6th dispatch from New York: The first session of the San Francisco Peace Conference opened on September 5th at 10:00 AM local time, presided over by Acheson in his capacity as acting chairman.

The morning session of the conference was marked by a strong statement from Soviet representative Gromyko. He demanded that a delegation from the People's Republic of China be invited to attend the conference. The Soviet representative's request was supported by the representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland.

However, the Americans, who organized the conference, managed to pass a decision stating that the issue of inviting a Chinese delegation was not up for discussion.

Australian representative Spender proposed the adoption of the "Rules of Procedure for the Conference" jointly proposed by the United States and the United Kingdom.

Gromyko said: The restrictions within these rules are unprecedented in international conference practice. The Soviet delegation believes that the drafters of the current draft rules of procedure are attempting to diminish the importance of this conference. The Soviet delegation believes that any country attending the conference has the right to make any suggestions, just as at the Paris Conference. In any case, the Soviet delegation will exercise its inalienable right to express its views and make suggestions.

However, after several other representatives spoke, the American voting machine passed the US-UK rules of procedure.

    旧金山对日和约会议开幕
    苏联代表建议邀我国出席
    葛罗米柯指责美国违背国际会议惯例
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：九月五日，旧金山当地时间上午十时，对日和约会议第一次会议在艾奇逊以代理主席的资格主持下开幕。
    会议的上午会议以苏联代表葛罗米柯的强有力的声明为特色。他要求应邀请中华人民共和国的代表团出席会议。苏联代表的要求得到捷克斯洛伐克代表与波兰代表的支持。
    可是组织会议的美国人设法通过了一个决定，说邀请中国代表团的问题不在讨论之列。
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德提议通过美英两国共同提出的“会议议事规则”。
    葛罗米柯说：这个规则里面的限制，是国际会议惯例上空前未有的。苏联代表团认为：草拟目前这个议事规则草案的人是企图贬低这次会议的重要性。苏联代表团认为：出席会议的任何一个国家都有权提出任何建议，就像在巴黎会议上那样。在任何情况下，苏联代表团都将行使它不可让与的权利，表示自己的意见，并提出建议。
    然而在另外几个代表发言之后，美国的表决机器就通过了美英的议事规则。
