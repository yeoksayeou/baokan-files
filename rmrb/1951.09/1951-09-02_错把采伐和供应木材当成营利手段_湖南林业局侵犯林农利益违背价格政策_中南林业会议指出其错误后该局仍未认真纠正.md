Since its establishment this spring, the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau has, under the leadership and assistance of higher authorities and with the support of the broad masses of farmers, made some achievements in supplying timber for national use. However, the bureau harbors a localized perspective that only considers the interests of its own department, mistakenly treating logging and timber supply as a means of profit, and neglecting the overall interests of the country and the interests of the masses of farmers. As a result, several serious errors have emerged in its work:

    Directly harvesting private forests of farmers
    Infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of forest farmers
    Eighty percent of the mountains and forests in Hunan are privately owned. Some of these are forests originally owned by farmers, and some are forests formerly belonging to landlords, local tyrants, or counter-revolutionaries that have not yet been distributed. The "Forest Distribution Methods" issued by the Central-South Region at the end of 1950 already stipulated that this part of the undistributed mountains and forests should be "distributed to farmers as much as possible." In reality, these were the fruits of victory that farmers deserved in their struggle against landlords and local tyrants. However, the Forestry Bureau not only felled these mountains and forests without compensation (only giving the local farmers' association ten to twenty catties of rice per two yards of timber as afforestation fees), but also directly felled the forests on the public mountains and ancestral mountains of middle peasants and poor peasants (i.e., mountains and forests jointly owned by a village or a clan), without paying for the mountains or only paying a very low price. For example, the forestry agency under the bureau felled the ancestral mountain of the Lei family in Lijiaping Village, Linwu County, without notifying the forest owner or paying for the mountain. The villagers requested that trees near the oil mill not be felled, so as not to damage the oil mill. The result was that they were still felled, and the oil mill was also damaged. They were only compensated with one hundred tiles and 20,000 RMB. The oil mill has not been repaired to this day.

    For example, in Longguiping Village in the same county, the bureau felled 10,000 railroad ties and mine timbers from the village's public mountain without paying for the mountain. The funding and timber for the two schools run by the village with this public mountain, as well as the funds to ensure the annual repair of a wooden bridge and a ferry, have all become problems. The bureau not only felled the forests on the public mountains and ancestral mountains of the masses, but also felled the forests on the private mountains of farmers. For example, a small patch of forest on five mu of land belonging to farmer Huang Shiying in Dutou Village, District Five, Zixing County, was also felled. The felling was done without the consent of the forest owner, and no payment was given for the mountain afterward. The bureau's direct infringement on the interests of the masses has aroused dissatisfaction among the general mountain farmers. They said, "The people led by Chairman Mao have turned over in the plains, but the people in the mountains have not yet turned over." They no longer cherish the forests, allowing landlords to destroy them, and even destroying them themselves.

    Making both forest farmers and timber-using departments suffer losses
    The bureau obtains more than 100% of huge profits
    The correct timber price policy should take into account three aspects simultaneously: (1) From the perspective of protecting and developing forestry production, provide appropriate mountain prices and purchase prices in mountainous areas to ensure the interests of forest farmers, so as to stimulate their enthusiasm for forest protection and afforestation; (2) Maintain reasonable allocation prices to avoid unnecessary difficulties for the construction work of industry and mining; (3) Maintain the normal profits necessary to complete the tasks assigned by the state and develop the business of the forestry agencies themselves. However, the bureau's approach is the opposite: (1) When felling timber, the bureau either does not give or gives very little mountain price (such as only paying 50 RMB per pine mine timber in Zixing County), and under the pretext of "reducing costs," implements a "three-contract system" with the forest area farmers' associations (i.e., the farmers' associations contract to fell, transport, and guard). In Chenzhou, the cost of each two yards of mine timber is as low as 137,000 RMB (the allocation price is 360,000 to 420,000 RMB). In western Hunan, the cost of fir timber transported from the mountains to places such as Zuoshi and Hongjiang is only 140,000 to 170,000 RMB per two yards, and the highest is no more than 280,000 RMB (the allocation price is 450,000 to 570,000 RMB). This kind of "cost reduction" actually deprives the farmers of a large part of the price they deserve. (2) Under the pretext of "purchasing more and reducing the amount of felling," the bureau purchases a large amount of timber, and collects a 15% afforestation fee from the people selling timber during the purchase, which is actually equivalent to suppressing the purchase price. As a result of this purchase, the average cost of purchasing each two yards of fir strips is only 300,000 RMB. (3) The price of timber allocated by the bureau to industrial and mining construction agencies is formally no higher than the general allocation price; however, the bureau additionally increases the "afforestation fee" and the undue "transportation fee" that are already included in the allocation price to the material-needed departments. The result is a disguised increase in the allocation price. From the above three points, although the allocation price of each two yards of mine timber is only 360,000 to 420,000 RMB, and the allocation price of each two yards of fir strips is only 450,000, 500,000, or 570,000 RMB, after adding the "afforestation fee" and "transportation fee," it is more than double the cost of the timber directly purchased by the bureau and the purchase cost. That is to say, the bureau's price policy is an erroneous policy in which both forest farmers and timber-using departments suffer losses while the bureau itself obtains more than 100% of huge profits. The implementation of this erroneous policy has aroused dissatisfaction among forest farmers. Forest farmers regard timber as "public affairs timber" and call the afforestation fee a "forestry tax." At the same time, some timber-needed departments cannot obtain timber supply in time due to the unresolved afforestation fee problem, which hinders production. For example, the report on the second page of this newspaper on August 22, which stated that some state-owned coal mines in North China and East China had great difficulties in production due to the inability to obtain mine timbers in time, is a prominent example.

    The bureau's actual arrangement for felling and purchasing numbers
    Greatly exceeds the tasks assigned by higher authorities
    The supply tasks assigned to Hunan by the Central-South Region this year, including the timber for the central, central-south administrative region and Hunan province levels, totaled more than 410,000 cubic meters, while the actual numbers arranged by the bureau for felling and purchasing were more than 494,000 two yards. Calculated at 1.6 cubic meters per two yards, the bureau purchased 384,000 cubic meters more than the task. If calculated at 1.2 cubic meters per two yards, it also purchased 177,700 cubic meters more than planned. Under the influence of the bureau's high profits from felling and purchasing timber and over-task purchasing, some special districts and county people's government agencies in Hunan Province have also risen up to imitate, all trying to solve local financial problems from timber, and competing to fell and sell timber, thus seriously destroying the mountains and forests.

    Errors must not be allowed to continue to develop
    So as not to cause more serious consequences
    If these serious errors existing in the bureau's work are allowed to develop, they will inevitably lead to the following evil consequences: (1) It will cause greater dissatisfaction among farmers and affect the relationship between the people's government and the farmers.

    (2) Affect the relationship between localities, between provinces, and between supply and demand parties (forestry and industry and mining), hindering the smooth progress of work. (3) Plant the seeds of disaster for agricultural and industrial construction. Because the result of indiscriminate logging will inevitably aggravate natural disasters such as water, drought, and wind, hindering agricultural production; at the same time, after the mountains and forests are destroyed, when the state carries out large-scale industrial construction, it will inevitably encounter the serious difficulty of not being able to obtain timber supply.

    The Central-South Military and Political Committee pointed out the harm of the above-mentioned erroneous practices of the Forestry Bureau at the first forestry conference of the entire region held on June 20, and pointed out the methods to correct the errors in the future. However, at the provincial forestry conference on July 28, the bureau did not review the past errors, nor did it implement the resolutions of the Central-South Agricultural and Forestry Conference. This attitude towards errors is actually a manifestation of irresponsibility to the people and the country. At present, the bureau has changed this attitude and has begun to review; it is hoped that after this review, the bureau will quickly and thoroughly correct the above-mentioned various errors.

    错把采伐和供应木材当成营利手段
    湖南林业局侵犯林农利益违背价格政策
    中南林业会议指出其错误后该局仍未认真纠正
    湖南省林业局在今春成立以来，在上级机关的领导、帮助和广大农民群众的支持下，供应国家用材的工作做出了一些成绩。但该局存在着只顾本部门利益的局部观点，错误地把采伐与供应木材当成营利的手段，忽视了国家的整体利益和农民群众的利益，以致在工作中表现出若干严重错误：
    直接采伐农民的私有林
    侵犯了林农的正当权益
    湖南的山林百分之八十为私有林，其中一部分是农民原有的山林，一部为尚未分配的原属地主、恶霸或反革命分子的山林。这一部分未分配的山林，在中南区一九五零年年底发下的“森林分配办法”中，早已规定“尽量分配给农民”，实际上是农民斗争地主、恶霸应得的胜利果实。但该林业局不但无代价地（砍伐每两码木材只交给当地农协会十至二十斤米作为造林费）砍伐了这部分山林，并且直接砍伐了中农、贫农原有的公山、族山的林木（即一村或一姓共有的山林），不给山价或只给很低的山价。如该局所属林业机关在临武县砍伐黎家坪村雷姓的族山，不通知林主，也不给山价。该村群众要求不要砍伐油房附近的树，以免砸坏油房。结果还是砍了，把油房也砸坏了，只赔偿了一百片瓦和人民币两万元。油房至今还没有修复。
    又如该局在同
    一县的龙归坪村砍伐该村公山制成枕木、坑木一万根，也不给山价。该村靠这公山开办的两个学校及保证常年修补一座木桥和一个渡船的经费和木料都成了问题。该局不仅砍伐群众的公山、族山的林木，也砍伐了农民的私山的林木。如资兴县五区渡头村农民黄世英的一小片五亩地的山林，也被砍伐了。砍伐前没有经过林主同意，砍伐以后也不给山价。该局这样直接侵犯群众利益，引起了一般山区农民的不满。他们说：“毛主席领导的人民，平地的翻了身，山上的还没有翻身。”他们对森林已不再爱护，任凭地主破坏，甚至自己也破坏。
    让林农和用材部门两头吃亏
    该局取得百分之百以上厚利
    正确的木材价格政策，应该是同时照顾到三方面的：（一）从保护与发展林业生产的观点出发，给予适当的山价及山区收购价，保证林农的利益，以激发其护林造林的积极性；（二）维持合理的调拨价格，以免使工矿业的建设工作发生不必要的困难；（三）维持为完成国家给予的上缴任务和发展林业机关本身业务所必需的正常的利润。但该局的做法却与此相反：（一）该局在采伐木材时既不给或少给山价（如在资兴县采伐每根松坑木只给人民币五十元），又在“降低成本”的藉口下向林区农民协会实行“三包制”（即由农民协会包砍，包运，包看管）。在郴州每两码坑木成本低至十三万七千元（调拨价格是三十六万到四十二万元），在湘西从山地运至陬市与洪江等处的杉木，每两码成本仅合十四万至十七万元，最高也不过二十八万元（调拨价格是四十五万到五十七万元）。这样的“降低成本”，实际上是剥夺了农民应得的一大部分代价。（二）该局在“多收购、减少采伐量”的藉口下大量收购木材，在收购中向卖木材的人征收百分之十五的育林费，实际上等于压价收购。这样收购的结果，平均每两码杉木条收购的成本只合三十万元。（三）该局供应工矿建设机关的调拨木材的价格，形式上是不比一般的调拨价格高的；但给需材部门额外增加了本来已包括在调拨价之内的“育林费”与不应有的“运费”，结果是变相地提高了调拨价格。由以上三点看来，尽管该局每两码坑木的调拨价格只是三十六万到四十二万元，杉木条每两码的调拨价格只是四十五万、五十万或五十七万元，但加上“育林费”与“运费”以后，比该局直接采购的木材成本和收购成本已高出一倍以上。也就是说，该局的价格政策是林农与需材部门两头吃亏而自己获得百分之百以上厚利的错误政策。执行这种错误政策的结果，引起林农不满。林农把木材看成了“公事木”，把育林费叫做
    “育林税”。同时，一些需材部门因育林费问题得不到解决，不能及时得到木材供应，以致妨碍了生产。如本报八月二十二日二版所载华北、华东一些国营煤矿因不能及时得到坑木而生产上发生很大困难的报道就是显著的例子。
    该局实际布置采伐收购数字
    大大超过上级分配给的任务
    中南区今年分配给湖南的供应任务，包括中央、中南行政区及湖南省三级的用材，共为四十一万余立方公尺，而该局实际布置采伐与收购的数字是四十九万四千余两码。按每两码折合一点六立方公尺计算，超过任务采购了三十八万四千立方公尺。如以每两码折合一点二立方公尺计算，也超过计划采购了十七万七千余立方公尺。在该局因采伐与收购木材获得高额利润与超任务采购的影响之下，湖南省的某些专区和县人民政府机关也都起来仿效，都从木材上打主意解决地方财政问题，竞相采伐、购销木材，因而严重地破坏了山林。
    错误不能任它继续发展
    以免招致更严重的恶果
    该局在工作中存在的这些严重错误，如果任它发展下去，必将招致以下几个恶果：（一）将会引起农民的更大不满而影响到人民政府与农民的关系。
    （二）影响到地方与地方、省内与省外以及供需双方（林业与工矿业）之间的关系，妨碍工作的顺利进行。（三）为农业与工业建设种下祸根。因为滥伐山林的结果，必将加重水、旱、风等自然灾害，妨害农业生产；同时，山林被破坏以后，到国家进行大规模的工业建设时，必将遭到得不到木材供应的严重困难。
    中南区军政委员会在六月二十日召开的全区首届林业会议曾指出该林业局以上错误作法的危害性，并指出今后纠正错误的办法。但该局在七月二十八日的全省林业会议中，对过去的错误并没有进行检讨，也没有贯彻中南农林会议的决议。这种对待错误的态度，实际上就是对人民和国家不负责任的表现。目前该局这种态度已有转变，并已开始进行检讨；希望该局经过这次检讨后，迅速彻底纠正上述各种错误。（田奇）
