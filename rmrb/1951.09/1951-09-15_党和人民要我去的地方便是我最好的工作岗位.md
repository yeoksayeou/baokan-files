Reader's Letter:

    The Place Where the Party and the People Need Me Is My Best Working Post

    Editor:
    I am a Communist Party member, and I have a lofty ideal – to fight to the end for the complete liberation of all mankind and the realization of a communist society in China. I often think about how to contribute all my energy to the cause of the Party, and I am constantly preparing myself ideologically to go to the place where the Party and the people need me most.

    This time, I was assigned to work in Inner Mongolia, and I think this is the best working post for me. I am very happy. I say it's the best, not because I already understand my job nature well, or because I think this job suits my "interests"; nor is it because my family and friends are there; but because I am participating in the great national construction, and I have realized my wish to serve the people wholeheartedly. The reason I feel so happy is that this working post was assigned to me by the Party and is the place where the people need me most. I feel that any work the Party and the people entrust to me is the best and most enjoyable work; because any work the Party and the people entrust to me is part of our revolutionary cause.

    Now I have made up my mind, and I am determined to build high-rise buildings from the ground up, brick by brick, and "turn the desert into fertile fields." I am looking forward to the day when today's barren grasslands will become a golden rice field. And I myself should contribute all my strength to the work of creating a new society.

    In the past two years, the Party's direct education and training have given me today's awareness, but I still have many shortcomings. In the future, I will continue to rely on the Party and the people in my new working post, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly improve my awareness so that I can better complete all the tasks assigned to me by the Party.

### 党和人民要我去的地方便是我最好的工作岗位

    党和人民要我去的地方便是我最好的工作岗位编辑同志：
    我是一个共产党员，我有着崇高的理想——为全人类的彻底解放和共产主义社会在中国的实现而斗争到底。我经常想到的是如何将自己的全部精力贡献给党的事业，我经常在思想上准备着到党和人民最需要我去的地方去。
    这次，我被分配到内蒙古去工作，我认为这对我是最好的工作岗位。我十分愉快。我说最好，不是因为我已经很了解我的工作性质，和以为这工作很适合我的“兴趣”；也不是因为那儿有我的家庭和亲友；而是因为我参加了伟大的祖国建设，我已实现了全心全意为人民服务的志愿。我所以感到十分愉快，是因为这个工作岗位是党分配给我的，是人民最需要我去的地方。我觉得：凡是党和人民交给我的工作，都是最好和最愉快的工作；因为，党和人民所交给我的任何工作，都是我们所进行的革命事业的一部分。
    如今我已下定决心，我立志要一砖一石地，从平地上修建起高楼大厦，“变沙漠为良田”。我在想望着，今日是荒凉的草原，明日便将是一片金黄的稻田。而我自己，正应该在创造新社会的工作中，贡献出自己的全部力量。
    两年来，党的直接教育和培养，已使我有了今天的觉悟，但我还有不少的缺点，今后我仍要在新的工作岗位上，依靠着党和人民，努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，不断地提高自己的觉悟，以便更好地来完成党所交给我的一切任务。
