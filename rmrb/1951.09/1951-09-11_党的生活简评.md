    Brief Comment on Party Life

    Disciplinary Action for Suppressors of Criticism

    Song Ying, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau, and Zhou Jifang, a member of the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, suppressed mass criticism, seriously violated the Party's democratic principles and the principles of criticism and self-criticism, and should be subject to Party disciplinary action.

    It is said that Song Ying's attitude of tyrannical retaliation towards mass criticism was because the masses' criticism of her "did not conform to the facts." In fact, some facts are already undeniable; however, Song Ying avoided talking about them. In fact, the main reason why Song Ying used a tyrannical attitude to suppress the masses was because she had serious ideas of pride and complacency. She believed that someone like her who had "contributed" to the Party should receive praise rather than criticism. This is clearly expressed in Song Ying's so-called self-criticism.

    Song Ying's mistake of suppressing criticism is extremely serious. Under the pretext that anonymous accusations were "illegal" behavior, she retaliated against those who criticized her. The General Branch Committee of the Health Bureau also made the wrong decision to "investigate the accuser," which led non-Party cadres to seriously demand that our Party "guarantee human rights." Zhou Jifang, a member of the Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, even shielded Song Ying, threatening the person who wrote the accusation letter, saying that this was "anonymous slander," this was "illegal" behavior, and this was an "incorrect" behavior that "violated the principles of discipline." In fact, it was precisely these wrongdoings of Song Ying and others that damaged the Party's prestige among the masses and the relationship between the Party and the masses.

    If the person who wrote the anonymous letter, as judged by Song Ying and the members of the General Branch Committee of the Health Bureau, is indeed a Party member, then it is not only necessary to examine Song Ying's work, but also to examine the lack of a democratic style within the Party organization of the Health Bureau. Such anonymous accusations are a manifestation of extremely abnormal Party democratic life, an extreme lack of a democratic style, and extremely underdeveloped criticism and self-criticism.

    The instruction of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on this issue is correct. The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee should seriously treat this issue. Disciplinary action must be taken against those who dare to violate the Party's organizational discipline, and there must be no leniency whatsoever.

    党的生活简评
    给压制批评者以纪律处分
    武汉市人民政府卫生局副局长宋瑛，中共武汉市卫生局总支委员会，以及武汉市人民政府党组及其成员之一的周季方等，压制群众批评，严重地违反了党的民主原则和党的批评与自我批评原则，应受到党的纪律处分。
    宋瑛对待群众批评所以采取蛮横报复的态度，据说是因为群众对她的批评“不符合事实”。其实，有些事实，已是无可置辩的了；不过宋瑛却避而不谈。事实上，宋瑛所以用蛮横态度压制群众，主要是由于她有严重的骄傲居功思想。她以为像她这样有“功”于党的人，应该受到的是表扬而不是批评。这在宋瑛的所谓检讨中，已明白地表现出来了。
    宋瑛压制批评的错误是极端严重的。她藉口匿名控告是“非法”行为，即向批评的人进行报复打击。卫生局总支委员会也随着作出“追查控告人”的错误决定，以致非党干部向我党严重地提出了“给予人权保障”的要求。武汉市人民政府党组及党组成员之一的周季方，竟也庇护宋瑛，威吓写控告信的人，说这是“匿名诬告”，这是“不法”行为，这是“违反纪律原则”的“错误”行为。实际上，正是宋瑛等的这些错误行为，损害了党在群众中的威信和党与群众的关系。
    写匿名信的人，真如宋瑛及卫生局总支委员所判断的，是党员。这就不仅仅要检查宋瑛的工作，而且还要检查卫生局党组织内缺乏民主作风的问题。这种匿名控告，正是党内民主生活极不正常，民主作风极端缺乏，批评和自我批评极不开展的表现。
    中共中央中南局对此问题的指示是正确的。武汉市委应严肃地对待这一问题。对于胆敢违反党的组织纪律的人，必须给予纪律处分，决不可有任何姑息。
