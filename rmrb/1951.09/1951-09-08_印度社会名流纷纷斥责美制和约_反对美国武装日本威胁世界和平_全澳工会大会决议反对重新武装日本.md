Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th—Many Indian social leaders have condemned the U.S.-made draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty. Mr. Loy, Joint Secretary of the India-China Friendship Association in Bombay, wrote: "It is simply unimaginable that the Chinese people, who fought the longest and hardest against Japanese militarists, suffered countless hardships in their glorious struggle, and made significant sacrifices, are being deprived of the right to speak when the Japanese Peace Treaty is signed." He pointed out: "Rearming Japan with the aim of reviving Japanese militarism poses not only a serious danger to the freedom and security of India and other Asian countries, but also aims to oppress the democratic and freedom-loving Japanese people. When the painful memories of the heinous Japanese militarists ravaging the Asian continent are still fresh in everyone's minds, freedom-loving Asian people will never allow such a tragedy to be repeated on their beautiful land."

Some prominent figures from the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, including Mrs. Shah Gupta, Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association of that States Union, Harbans Lal, Chairman of the Congress Party Committee of that States Union, Hardit Singh Bhattal, a well-known peasant leader, Hardyal Singh, Chairman of the Peace Committee of that States Union, Balwant Gargi, a famous Punjabi playwright, and Tarana Chand Gupta, Chairman of the Journalists Association of that States Union, jointly issued the following statement:

"We support Prime Minister Nehru's position of refusing to participate in the U.S.-orchestrated conference in San Francisco to sign the so-called Japanese Peace Treaty. Every sensible person knows that the Japanese Peace Treaty to be signed by the puppets of the U.S. rulers is a crude fabrication aimed at legitimizing the U.S. occupation of Japan. A treaty not signed by major Asian powers such as People's China and India is not worth the paper it is printed on.

Ignoring the opposition of Asian public opinion, remilitarizing Japan is the main action of the U.S. rulers in preparing for a third world war in the Far East, and therefore every democratic group should oppose it.

The great Chinese people, the people of Southeast Asia and India will continue to fight together with the peace-loving Japanese people against the American-style trickery that is recently called a treaty.”

The Secretary of the Bihar Provincial Peace Committee expressed his opinion on the U.S.-made draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty, saying: "The U.S. government's proposal to conclude a one-sided agreement with the Japanese rulers is an attempt to continue to place Japan under U.S. occupation and make Japan serve the U.S. aggressive conspiracy against the Asian people."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th—Kapoor, Secretary of the Delhi Democratic Women's League of India, met with a reporter from this agency and spoke on the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty. She condemned the U.S. draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty as "a threat to Asian peace and world peace."

She said: "The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, who truly hope that Japan will become an independent, democratic, and peace-loving country, have proposed to conclude a just Japanese Peace Treaty this year. The U.S. imperialists have rejected this correct proposal. This behavior of the U.S. imperialists is sufficient to illustrate their aggressive ambitions towards Asia, especially towards the Chinese people. The Indian people are eager to conclude a democratic peace treaty with Japan; we are eager not to allow Japanese militarism to revive."

Kapoor continued, representing the Delhi Democratic Women's League, to severely condemn the U.S. imperialists' draft treaty and demanded the conclusion of a just Japanese Peace Treaty that included the participation of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

She believes that the Asian people and the Chinese people, joining hands, will surely defeat the U.S. imperialists' plans and ensure peace in Asia and the world. She said: "Indian women are encouraged by the examples set by our great sisters in the Soviet Union, China, and Korea, and must shoulder their own tasks in the noble struggle for peace in Asia and the world."

Xinhua News Agency, 6th—Melbourne: The Australian Council of Trade Unions (formerly translated as the Trade Union Council) opened in Melbourne on September 3rd. The vast majority of delegates attending the conference declared their opposition to the rearming of Japan in any form.

The conference resolved to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, a ban on atomic bombs, opposition to the Menzies government's war plans, and advocacy of universal disarmament.

The proposal passed by the conference stated: "This conference strongly condemns the act of releasing Japanese and German war criminals. The remilitarization of Japan will be a constant threat to Australia's security. We strongly protest against the terms of the Japanese Peace Treaty that allow Japan to rearm and turn it into an aggressor country again. Therefore, we instruct the responsible personnel of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to notify the United Nations Organization, the President of the United States, and the Australian government: We oppose the signing of a treaty that allows Japan to become a new militarist country partially or wholly."

Finally, the conference passed a resolution calling on all trade unions to support the referendum movement against declaring the Australian Communist Party illegal.

    印度社会名流纷纷斥责美制和约
    反对美国武装日本威胁世界和平
    全澳工会大会决议反对重新武装日本
    【新华社新德里七日电】印度许多社会领袖纷纷谴责美制对日和约草案。孟买印中友好协会联合秘书洛依先生写道：“与日本军国主义者作战时间最长，最艰苦，在他们的光荣斗争中遭受了无数苦难，作了重大牺牲的中国人民，在对日和约签订的时候被剥夺了发言的权利，这件事简直是不可想像的。”他指出：“以复活日本军国主义为目的而把日本重新武装起来，不仅对印度及其他亚洲国家的自由和安全有严重的危险，同时也是为了要压迫民主的及爱好自由的日本人民。当可恨的日本军国主义者蹂躏亚洲大陆的惨痛记忆在大家的脑海里印象犹新的时候，爱好自由的亚洲人民将永远不许这种悲剧在他们美好的土地上重演。”
    巴地阿拉及东旁遮普邦联盟的一些著名人物，包括该邦联盟的印中友好协会主席沙·古普塔夫人，该邦联盟的国大党委员会主席哈本斯·拉尔，著名的农民领袖哈地特·星格·巴塔尔，该邦联盟和平委员会主席哈代尔·星格，著名的旁遮普语剧作家巴尔温特·加地，该邦联盟记者协会主席塔那成德·古普塔等人，曾联名发表了以下的声明：
    “我们拥护尼赫鲁总理拒绝参加在旧金山举行的美国一手包办的签订所谓对日和约的会议的立场。每一个头脑清醒的人都知道，美国统治者要他们的傀儡签署的对日和约，是一个粗制滥造的东西，其目的是使美国对日本的占领合法化。没有亚洲的大国如人民中国及印度签字的和约，其价值抵不上刊印和约的那一张纸片。
    无视亚洲公共舆论的反对，使日本重新军国主义化是美国统治者在远东准备第三次世界大战的主要行动，因此每一个民主团体都应该加以反对。
    伟大的中国人民、东南亚及印度的人民将与爱好和平的日本人民继续共同奋斗，反对最近美其名为和约的美国式样的鬼把戏。”
    比哈尔省和平委员会秘书表述他对美制对日和约草案的意见说：“美国政府关于与日本统治者订立片面协定的建议，是想继续置日本于美国的占领之下，使日本为美国反对亚洲人民的侵略阴谋服务。”
    【新华社新德里七日电】印度德里民主妇女联盟书记加蒲尔接见本社记者，就对日和约问题发表谈话。她斥责美国对日和约草案是“对亚洲和平与世界和平的威胁”。
    她说：“真正希望日本成为独立、民主和爱好和平的国家的中华人民共和国和苏联，曾经提出在本年内缔结公正的对日和约的建议。美帝国主义者拒绝了这个正确的建议。美帝国主义者的这种行为，适足以说明他们对亚洲，特别是对中国人民的侵略野心。印度人民切望与日本缔结民主的和约；我们切望不让日本军国主义复活。”
    加蒲尔继代表德里民主妇女联盟，严厉斥责美帝国主义者的和约草案，并要求缔结有中华人民共和国和苏联参加的公正而合乎民主原则的对日和约。
    她认为：亚洲人民和中国人民携起手来，一定会击败美帝国主义者的计划，并确保亚洲和全世界的和平。她说：“印度妇女受到苏联、中国、和朝鲜的伟大的姊妹们所树立的榜样的鼓舞，一定要在争取亚洲和全世界的和平的崇高斗争中，担负起自己的任务。”
    【新华社六日讯】墨尔本讯：全澳工会大会（前译工会理事会）于九月三日在墨尔本开幕。出席大会的绝大多数代表声明反对以任何形式重新武装日本。
    大会决议要求缔结五大国和平公约，和平解决朝鲜问题、禁用原子弹、反对孟席斯政府的战争计划以及主张普遍裁减军备。
    大会所通过的建议说：“本大会极力谴责释放日本与德国战犯的行为。日本重新军国主义化，将是对澳大利亚安全的经常威胁。我们对于允许日本重新武装并使其再度变为侵略国的对日和约条款，提出强硬的抗议。因此，我们责成澳大利亚工会大会的负责人员通知联合国组织、美国总统与澳大利亚政府：我们反对签订那种允许日本部分地或全部地变为新军国主义国家的条约。”
    最后，大会并通过决议，要求各工会支持反对宣布澳大利亚共产党为非法的公民投票运动。
