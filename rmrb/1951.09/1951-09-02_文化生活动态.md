    "Exhibition of Literature and Art of the People's Republic of China" Warmly Received by Soviet Audiences

    The "Exhibition of Literature and Art of the People's Republic of China," held by the All-China Association for Friendship with the Soviet Union at the Scholars' Building in Leningrad in April this year at the request of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, has successfully concluded. During the exhibition, it was warmly welcomed by Soviet audiences. Yefimov, Director of the Oriental Department of Leningrad State University, said: "The Exhibition of Literature and Art of the People's Republic of China gave me a deep impression; it is one of the most powerful links in consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship—the friendship of two great nations—and fighting for world peace. It helped us to more fully understand the heroic deeds of the Chinese people in fighting against the enemy—the bloody American imperialism and its internal reactionary ruling class. The propaganda posters of Stalin and Mao Zedong (referring to the New Year pictures 'Great Friendship' by Feng Zhen and Li Qi) clearly emphasize the main direction and main thought of the exhibition." Petrov, assistant teacher of the Oriental Department of Leningrad University, said: "This exhibition is of great interest to scholars studying China, as well as to the broad Soviet public. What is most interesting is the works of modern Chinese famous writers and poets exhibited in the meeting—Zhou Yang, Xiao San, Liu Baiyu, Ding Ling, Ai Qing and many other writers. The books mention the construction of New China, the Chinese workers and peasants, as well as the struggle of scholars and writers for peace, and the heroic deeds of the People's Republic of China in aiding Korea in the war." The success of this exhibition shows the further exchange between China and the Soviet Union in culture, and shows that our literary and artistic works are generally valued by Soviet audiences.

    Shanghai Artists Collectively Create Comic Strips about Song Jing Poetry

    The comic strip "Song Jing Poetry and Wu Xun" collectively created by 60 Shanghai artists including Mi Gu, Zhang Leping, Shen Tongheng, Chen Yanqiao, Zhang Wenyuan, Zhao Hongben, Yang Junsheng, Zhang Biwu, Ying Yeping, and Lin Xueyan (including comic strip writers, traditional Chinese painters, woodcut workers, cartoonists, and commercial artists) began to be serialized in the Shanghai Jiefang Daily on August 20. This set of comic strips is based on the "Investigation Record of Wu Xun's History" recently published in the People's Daily. Mi Gu is responsible for the text editing, Zhang Leping is responsible for the modeling of the main characters, and then the 60 artists participating in the work are divided into groups to engage in the creation of drafts, and finally Mi Gu, Zhang Leping, and Li Binghong are responsible for the finishing and unification work. This kind of collective creation has a unified character modeling, which unifies the style of the front and back pictures, and is a new attempt in the collective creation method of comic strips.

    “中华人民共和国文学艺术展览会”受到苏联观众的热烈欢迎
    中苏友好协会总会应苏联科学院的要求，于今年四月在列宁格勒学者大厦举行的“中华人民共和国文学艺术展览会”，业已胜利闭幕。展出期间，受到苏联观众的热烈欢迎。国立列宁格勒大学东方系主任耶非莫夫说：“中华人民共和国的文学与艺术展览会，给了我一个很深的印象；它是巩固中苏友谊——两个伟大民族的友谊——为全世界和平事业而斗争的最有力的环节之一，它帮助了我们更充分地认识到中国人民对敌人——血腥的美帝国主义及其内部的反动统治阶级进行斗争的英勇事迹。斯大林与毛泽东画像的宣传画（指冯真、李奇所作年画‘伟大的友谊’），是极其明显地强调了展览会的主要方向与主要思想。”列宁格勒大学东方系助教彼德洛夫说：“这次展览，对研究中国的学者，以及对广大的苏联社会人士有着极大的兴趣，最引起兴趣的是会中所展出的现代中国名作家和诗人——周扬、萧三、刘白羽、丁玲、艾青等及其他很多作家的作品，书中述及到关于新中国的建设，中国工农大众，以及学者与文学家为和平的斗争，和中华人民共和国在援助朝鲜作战的英勇事迹。”这次展览会的成功，说明了中国和苏联在文化上的进一步的交流，说明了我国文学与艺术作品受到苏联观众普遍的重视。
