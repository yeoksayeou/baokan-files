Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: The meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France began in Washington today (September 12th). Following this meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting will be held in Ottawa starting on September 15th. Both meetings are convened by US imperialism to prepare to force Britain, France, and other Western European vassal states to intensify war preparations. The agenda will include determining plans to intensify the arming of West Germany, revising the peace treaty with Italy, bringing Greece and Turkey into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, utilizing Franco's Spain to further serve the North Atlantic bloc, intensifying the deployment of aggression in the Far East after signing a separate peace treaty with Japan, supporting French colonialists in attacking the Vietnamese people, and intensifying war preparations worldwide. To this end, foreign ministers of North Atlantic countries, US High Commissioner for Germany McCloy, US Ambassador to France Bruce, Commander-in-Chief of the French colonial forces in Vietnam Tassigny, and others have arrived in Washington.

However, although US imperialism has so many aspects of aggressive goals in these two meetings, the future of the meetings is full of difficulties. Now facing the US imperialists is a bleak picture of the entire North Atlantic bloc.

Since the NATO Council passed a resolution to expand military production at the New York meeting in September last year, and a resolution to establish the North Atlantic Unified Aggressor Army at the Brussels meeting in December, the governments of Britain, France, and other Western European countries have increased military spending, and the US warlord Eisenhower has also established his North Atlantic Aggressor Army headquarters in Western Europe. However, all this is still a long way from the main goal of the United States – gathering Western European cannon fodder to form the North Atlantic Army. A United Press dispatch from London on September 3rd quoted military authorities as saying that Eisenhower "originally planned to form twenty-five divisions by 1951...but he only has twelve divisions so far." After nine members of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigated war preparations in Western Europe in July, they stated in a formal report published on August 12th: "The establishment of the army in Western Europe is very slow...Eisenhower headquarters is dissatisfied that the United States has doubled its army size since the Korean War, but Western Europe has only increased by 20 percent."

The ruling groups in Western European countries are not unwilling to build more troops, but the current scale of war preparations has dragged the economies of Western European countries into a serious crisis. Italy's five million unemployed and semi-unemployed people, France's staggering fiscal deficit of 800 billion francs, and Britain's unprecedented record of an import surplus of 150 million pounds in June illustrate the extent of the deterioration of these countries' economic situations. The aforementioned members of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee also admitted in their official report: In these "financially precarious countries, accelerating mobilization can easily cause these countries' economies to collapse." A recent editorial in the Italian "Mail" even wailed: "When the people of Italy, France, and Britain realize that they lack necessities due to rearmament, that will be the dark days of the North Atlantic Alliance."

The "dark days" of the North Atlantic aggression bloc are not limited to the economic aspect. The ruling groups of Western European countries have faced increasingly strong opposition from the people in their countries and are facing a serious political crisis because they have implemented the US's war preparation policy. Italian reactionaries lost a large number of votes in the local elections in May and June, and the crisis that occurred in the Gasperi government in July proved that its rule had reached a precarious state. After the general election in June, the position of the French reactionaries became more fragile, and there was an unprecedented government crisis of thirty-two days. US "Newsweek" revealed that US military governor in Western Europe Eisenhower had sadly admitted that Western Europe's "governments are all barely able to come to power with great effort, and if they are asked to implement more rearmament, it will cause them to collapse."

The United States, at the Washington and Ottawa meetings, wants to force these Western European vassal states, who are struggling to protect themselves, to accelerate their service to the US's aggressive policies. Before the meetings, these vassals had unanimously expressed their desire for the United States to give alms in US dollars to maintain their precarious rule. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gaitskell has gone to the United States to discuss Britain's economic and financial problems with the US government in Washington during the meeting. Italian newspapers also said that Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Gasperi will also ask the United States for more US dollars in Washington. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris said: "Some delegations participating in the NATO Council meeting, especially the Dutch delegation, will not only request to study the economic issues related to military assistance, but will also request that the economic situation of each individual country be regarded as part of the Western European arms expansion issue."

In this way, the US government will encounter countless difficulties on the complex agenda of the Washington and Ottawa meetings, and there is very little certainty of solving these difficulties. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on September 7th revealed: "The agenda of the three foreign ministers' meeting is very heavy, and Washington diplomatic observers doubt whether the three foreign ministers will have time to study these issues one by one."

    美英法外长会议和北大西洋公约理事会议前途黯淡
    美国迫使西欧仆从加紧备战遭到重重困难
    【新华社十二日讯】美、英、法三外长会议于今日（九月十二日）起在华盛顿举行。紧接着这个会议，北大西洋公约理事会会议亦将自九月十五日起在渥太华举行。这两个会议都是美帝国主义为准备逼迫英法及其他西欧附庸国家加紧备战而召开的。其议程将有确定加紧武装西德计划的问题，修改对意和约的问题，把希腊、土耳其拉入北大西洋公约的问题，利用佛朗哥西班牙为北大西洋集团进一步效劳的问题，在签订单独对日和约以后加紧布置远东侵略部署的问题，支持法国殖民者进攻越南人民的问题，以及其他在全世界加紧备战的问题。为此，北大西洋各国外交部长，美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃，美国驻法大使勃鲁斯，法国驻越殖民军总司令塔西尼等均已到达华盛顿。
    但是，虽然美帝国主义在这两个会议中有着如此多方面的侵略目的，会议的前途却充满着困难。现在摆在美帝国主义者面前的，是整个北大西洋集团内部一幅景象黯淡的图画。
    自从去年北大西洋公约理事会在九月纽约会议上通过扩大军事生产的决议，以及在十二月布鲁塞尔会议上通过建立北大西洋统一侵略军的决议以来，英、法等西欧各国政府都增加了军事开支，美国军阀艾森豪威尔也已经在西欧建立了他的北大西洋侵略军总部。但是，这一切离美国最主要的目标——搜罗西欧炮灰编组北大西洋军，还有很大的距离。合众社伦敦九月三日电引军事当局消息称：艾森豪威尔“原计划在一九五一年以前可以编成二十五个师，……但是，他到现在还只有十二个师”。美国参院外交委员会九个委员七月间到西欧调查备战情况后，在八月十二日发表的正式报告中说：“西欧建立陆军，甚为缓慢。……艾森豪威尔总部对于自从朝鲜战争发生以来，美国已将其陆军人数增加一倍，但西欧只增加百分之二十，感到不满。”
    西欧各国统治集团并不是不愿意建立更多的军队，但是目前这样规模的备战部署，已经把西欧各国经济拖入严重的危机中。意大利五百万失业及半失业的大军，法国财政上八千亿法郎的惊人赤字，英国在六月份入超一亿五千万英镑的空前纪录，说明了这些国家经济情况恶化的程度。上述美参院外交委员会委员们在正式报告中也供认：在这些“财政上风雨飘摇的国家，加速动员一事，很容易使得这些国家的经济垮台”。意大利“邮报”最近发表的社论中更哀号：“在意大利、法国与英国人民体会到他们因重新武装而缺乏生活必需品的时候，也就是北大西洋联盟的黑暗日子的到来。”
    北大西洋侵略集团的“黑暗日子”还不仅限于经济方面。西欧各国统治集团因为执行美国的备战政策，已遭到国内人民越来越强烈的反对，面临严重的政治危机。意大利反动派在五、六月地方选举中失去了大量选票，加斯贝利政府七月中所发生的危机证明了其统治已达摇摇欲坠的境地。法国反动派在六月大选后，地位更加脆弱，竟发生了历史上空前的三十二天的政府危机。美国“新闻周刊”透露：美国驻西欧军事总督艾森豪威尔曾经悲哀地承认：西欧“这些政府都是费了九牛二虎之力才勉勉强强登台的，如果叫它们再实行更多的重整军备，就会使它们垮台”。
    美国在华盛顿会议及渥太华会议上就是要压迫这些自身难保的西欧各国奴仆们加速为美国侵略政策效劳的。在会议以前，这些奴仆都已一致表示要美国施舍美元，来维系他们的垂危的统治。英国财政大臣贾兹克尔已前往美国，准备在会议期间在华盛顿与美国政府商讨英国的经济及财政问题。意大利报纸也说：意大利总理兼外交部长加斯贝利也将在华盛顿向美国要求更多的美元。法新社巴黎消息说：“有些参加北大西洋公约理事会的代表团，特别是荷兰代表团，不仅将要求研究关于军事援助的经济问题，而且将要求把每一个别国家的经济形势，看作是西欧扩充军备问题的一部分。”
    这样，美国政府在华盛顿会议与渥太华会议庞杂的议程上，将碰到无数的难题，而对解决这些难题，则极少把握。法新社华盛顿九月七日电透露：“三外长会议的议程是份量很重的，华盛顿外交观察家怀疑三外长是否有时间能对这些问题一一加以研究。”
