Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Agree that Recruiting Staff Should Not Restrict Those Over Forty Years Old
    Editor's Note: On September 9th, this newspaper published letters from Comrades Wu Longwen and Wan Yong regarding "Agencies should not restrict those over forty years old from participating in staff recruitment." Since then, we have received many letters from readers agreeing with this opinion. Now, we are publishing two selected letters below:
    One, Editor Comrades:
    The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on September 9th published a letter from Comrades Wu Longwen and Wan Yong regarding "Agencies should not restrict those over forty years old from participating in staff recruitment." This opinion is completely correct. In the past, those over forty years old who wanted to find work would sigh and exclaim "We are useless!" every time they saw an advertisement for staff recruitment. Although I am not yet forty years old, the people over forty years old that I know all have opinions on this issue. When the People's Daily of September 9th arrived, they eagerly read the letter from Comrades Wu Longwen and Wan Yong. Everyone unanimously agreed with their opinion.
    I believe that agencies should not restrict those over forty years old from participating in staff recruitment.

    Two, Editor Comrades:
    I completely agree with the opinion raised by Comrades Wu Longwen and Wan Yong in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on September 9th, that "Agencies should not restrict those over forty years old from participating in staff recruitment." Many people over forty years old, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are willing to learn, seek to transform themselves, and contribute their strength to the construction of our great motherland. Their enthusiasm is welcome, and their strength is not to be ignored. However, some agencies do not choose staff based on their work ability, but restrict a portion of people from participating in work based on their age. In this way, the country's construction cause will suffer losses, and some people over forty years old who are eager to participate in work even falsely report their age to find work. I once heard a rickshaw worker say: "I have been repairing and driving cars for more than twenty years. I lost my job during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and started pulling a rickshaw. But I have never forgotten my skills. After liberation, I tried several times to find work as a car driver, etc. My skills and health conditions are all qualified, but I am almost fifty years old, so I cannot find a job."
    I believe that the emergence of these phenomena is due to the fact that some agencies and schools have overlooked that people over forty years old are also a part of the force for building a new China. I hope that agencies will earnestly change this unreasonable age restriction when recruiting staff.

### 同意招考工作人员不应限制四十岁以上的人参加

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    同意招考工作人员不应限制四十岁以上的人参加
    编者按：九月九日，本报发表了吴隆文、万勇两同志关于“各机关招考工作人员时不应限制四十岁以上的人参加”的来信后，即陆续收到许多读者来信，同意这个意见。现将来信选刊两封于后：
    一编辑同志：
    九月九日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了吴隆文、万勇两同志关于“各机关招考工作人员时不应限制四十岁以上的人参加”的来信，这个意见是完全正确的。过去四十岁以上的想找工作的人，每看见一次招考工作人员的广告，就唉声叹气，大呼“我们没有用了”。我的年龄虽不到四十岁，但我熟悉的四十岁以上的人，他们对于这个问题都有意见。九月九日的人民日报来了，他们争相阅读吴隆文、万勇两同志的来信。大家一致同意他们的意见。
    我认为各机关招考工作人员时，不应限制四十岁以上的人参加。

    二编辑同志：
    我完全同意九月九日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载吴隆文、万勇二同志提出的“各机关招考工作人员时不应限制四十岁以上的人参加”的意见。很多四十岁以上的人，在共产党、毛主席领导下，愿意学习，要求改造自己，为伟大祖国的建设事业，贡献自己的力量。他们的热情是值得欢迎的，他们的力量是不可忽视的。但是，某些机关却不以工作能力来选择工作人员，而从年岁上限制一部分人参加工作。这样，国家建设事业就会受到损失，某些四十岁以上而迫切要求参加工作的人，竟假报年岁来找工作。我曾听到一位三轮车工人说：“我修理和驾驶汽车二十多年。国民党反动统治时我失业了，开始蹬三轮车。但我没有一天忘记我的技术。解放后，我几次想找汽车司机等工作做。我技术和健康等条件都合格，但我快五十岁了，就找不到工作。”
    我认为这些现象的产生，是由于某些机关学校忽视了四十岁以上的人也是建设新中国的一部分力量。希望各机关招考工作人员时，切实改变这种不合理的年龄限制。
