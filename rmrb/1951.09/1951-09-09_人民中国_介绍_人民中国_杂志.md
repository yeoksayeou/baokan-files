    People's China
    ——Introducing the "People's China" Magazine
    By Yē. Guōwǎlièfū

    The Foreign Languages Press of China began publishing the Russian-language "People's China" magazine in November of last year. The inaugural editorial of the first issue of this magazine pointed out that its task is to introduce to readers the achievements of the People's Republic of China in peaceful construction, thereby helping to consolidate the cause of the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    The People's Republic of China has already achieved great successes in economic and cultural construction. "People's China" magazine wrote: "These achievements are the result of the great labor of the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the brotherly assistance given by the great socialist country—the Soviet Union."

    Great changes are taking place in China. These changes were only made possible by the victory of the people's revolution.

    The Chinese people's wholehearted support for their government is a decisive condition for China's continuous development in politics, economy, and culture.

    From the very first days of taking power, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China carried out extremely important revolutionary reforms. Industrial enterprises, banks, and other economic properties that previously belonged to the Chinese comprador bourgeoisie, Japanese invaders, and traitorous collaborators were confiscated. Railways, postal services, telecommunications, shipping, and highway transportation were nationalized. The People's Government implemented control over China's foreign trade. As a result of these measures, the economic lifeline of the country is firmly in the hands of the state, guaranteeing its ability to guide and adjust economic development.

    Relying on its own strength and cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the People's Republic of China is confidently moving forward on the road of continuous development in politics, economy, and culture.

    The Chinese people, liberated from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, are enthusiastically striving to restore the economy that was destroyed by the Japanese occupiers, the Kuomintang, and the American interventionists. In 1950, the production volume of heavy industrial enterprises increased compared to the 1949 level: pig iron increased 11.4 times, steel increased 7.8 times, cement increased 3.8 times, and machine manufacturing increased 3 times.

    A mass patriotic production competition movement has unfolded across the country. By the end of April of this year, 2,811 enterprises with 2,232,000 workers were involved in the production competition. All regions are completing production plans ahead of schedule; in industry and agriculture, innovators and labor heroes are increasing in number.

    The people's government is successfully solving an extremely important task—eliminating the land ownership system of landlords in rural China—which is the pillar of the reactionaries. This summer, land reform has been completed in regions with approximately 290 million agricultural population—accounting for nearly two-thirds of China's agricultural population. Eliminating the exploitative system of landlord land ownership and distributing land to millions of landless and land-poor peasants has created an atmosphere of high political enthusiasm in the countryside. Land reform has greatly consolidated the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, increased the countryside's trust in the new government, and created favorable conditions for developing agricultural productivity and China's industrialization. Last year's grain harvest already exceeded the 1949 harvest by 10 million tons.

    Foreign trade is of great significance to the economy of the People's Republic of China. Before the victory of the people's revolution, China's foreign trade was controlled by imperialist plunderers and was in a long-term trade deficit. "People's China" magazine wrote that the key to the Chinese market was previously in the hands of the Americans; they filled the country with all kinds of dumped goods. Machinery and tools that were urgently needed were not imported, because foreign capitalists were not interested in China's industrial development. What they paid attention to was keeping this large country as a supplier of agricultural raw materials for imperialist countries.

    In 1950, fundamental changes occurred in China's foreign trade. For the first time in decades, China's foreign trade had a surplus: exports exceeded imports by 9.5 percent. The main imported goods were items necessary for China's industrial development. "People's China" magazine wrote that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries occupy the first place in China's foreign trade; they "provide China with friendly assistance, helping it to develop its industry and achieve economic independence and prosperity."

    While the national economy is being restored, the people's material well-being and cultural level are also improving. The hunger and poverty of the Chinese laborers are gone forever. Workers' wages are increasing along with the recovery and development of industry. The lives of peasants are also entering a prosperous state.

    Chinese laborers are eager to learn culture and knowledge. The democratic government is opening batches of adult literacy schools and cultural training courses one after another. In 1950, 1,064,736 people were studying in training classes to improve their technical knowledge. The vast majority of students in primary and secondary schools across the country are children of laborers. China now has 201 institutions of higher learning, with over 128,000 university students, and 400,000 primary and secondary schools, with nearly 31 million primary and secondary school students. Chinese peasants have also gained extensive opportunities to learn knowledge and culture.

    The Communist Party of China—the vanguard of the Chinese working class—is the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Chinese people. The Party, with 5.8 million members, is the main force in transforming the country. The Communist Party of China, led by the tested leader Comrade Mao Zedong, unites and rallies the outstanding forces of the entire nation to revitalize the country and make it more prosperous.

    The government of the People's Republic of China is fundamentally different from the past Kuomintang regime; the former implements a fundamentally different foreign policy that conforms to the interests of the people. Developing friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and all those who are fighting for peace—this is the foreign policy implemented by the free Chinese people. Solid, brotherly, and equal cooperative relations have been established between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in economic and cultural fields.

    The eternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is an indestructible force that can shatter the mad plans of the instigators of a new war.

    Premier Zhou Enlai of the Government Administration Council wrote: "The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a fraternal alliance against imperialist aggression and for the defense of world peace. China and the Soviet Union are two powerful countries in the world, with 700 million united people, and their strong alliance has become an invincible force in the world. The formation of this force has not only greatly strengthened the advantage of the world peace and democracy camp, but also severely struck the imperialist bloc's policy of aggression and war in the East."

    The Chinese people are actively fighting to consolidate peace. The signature campaign for the World Peace Council's declaration calling for a Five-Power Peace Pact has been very successful in the People's Republic of China. By the end of July, approximately 344 million Chinese people, more than 70 percent of the country's population, had signed in support of this declaration; approximately 340 million people voted against arming Japan. The Chinese people's signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the remilitarization of Japan has confirmed their firm and thorough commitment to safeguarding peace. The Chinese people's response to American imperialist armed intervention in Korea is to further unite their ranks and further expand the peace movement.

    The materials published in "People's China" magazine prove that the young People's Republic of China is increasingly developing in economy and culture. Broad prospects for building a new life are unfolding before the Chinese laborers. The American aggressors' attempts to undermine China's democratic construction with spies, secret agents, and traitors are doomed to failure.

    Broad sections of Soviet society welcome each issue of "People's China" magazine with great interest. This magazine shows the life and struggle of the Chinese people, thereby further consolidating the indestructible and eternal friendship between the two great peoples of the Soviet Union and China.

    人民中国
    ——介绍“人民中国”杂志

    中国外文出版社，从去年十一月开始出版俄文的“人民中国”杂志。这一杂志第一期的发刊词指出，它的任务，是要向读者介绍中华人民共和国和平建设的成绩，从而有助于巩固以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营的事业。
    中华人民共和国在经济建设和文化建设方面，已经获得了很大的成绩。“人民中国”杂志写道：“这些成绩，是中国共产党所领导的伟大的中国人民从事巨大的劳动和伟大的社会主义国家——苏联给予兄弟的援助的结果”。
                            ×  ×  ×
    种种伟大的变化，正在中国发生。这些变化，只是由于人民革命的胜利，才有可能发生的。
    中国人民全力拥护自己的政府，乃是中国在政治、经济与文化各方面不断发展的决定性的条件。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府从开始掌握政权的头几天起，就进行了极重要的革命性的改革。从前属于中国买办资产阶级、日本侵略者、汉奸卖国贼的工业企业、银行以及其他经济财产，被没收了。铁道、邮政、电讯事业，以及航运、公路运输，收归国家所有了。人民政府对中国的对外贸易，实行了管制。施行这一切措施的结果，国家的经济命脉，巩固地掌握在国家手中，保证它有可能指导和调整经济的发展。
    中华人民共和国依靠自己本身的力量，以及与苏联和人民民主国家的合作，正有信心地在政治、经济、文化不断发展的道路上前进。
    中国人民从帝国主义与封建主义的束缚下获得了解放，正在热忱地努力恢复被日本占领者、国民党和美国干涉者所破坏了的经济。一九五○年重工业企业的生产量，比一九四九年的水平提高了：铣铁提高了十一点四倍，钢提高了七点八倍，水泥提高了三点八倍，机器制造业提高了三倍。
    全国展开了群众性的爱国生产竞赛运动。到今年四月底时，有两千八百一十一个企业的二百二十三万二千工人卷入了生产竞赛。各地都在提前完成生产计划；工农业中，生产革新者和劳动英雄愈来愈增多了。
    人民政权顺利地解决着一个极重要的任务——消灭中国农村中的地主占有土地制——这是反动派的支柱。今年夏天，在约有农业人口二亿九千万人——占中国农业人口将近三分之二——的地区，已完成了土地改革。消灭地主占有土地的剥削制度，把土地分配给千百万无地和少地的农民，造成了农村中政治热情高涨的气象。土地改革，大大地巩固了工人阶级与农民的联盟，提高了农村对新政权的信任，创立了发展农业生产力和中国工业化的有利条件。去年的谷物收获量，就已经超过一九四九年的收获量一千万吨。
    对外贸易对于中华人民共和国的经济，是有重大的意义的。在人民革命胜利以前，中国的对外贸易掌握在帝国主义掠夺者手中，是长期入超的。“人民中国”杂志写道，中国市场的锁钥，过去掌握在美国人手中；他们以各种各样的倾销货品，充斥了全国。经常感到极其需要的机器和工具，则没有入口，因为外国资本家们对中国的工业发展，是不发生兴趣的。他们所注重的，是要使这个大国依旧是帝国主义国家的农业原料供给地。
    一九五○年，中国的对外贸易发生了根本的变化。中国的对外贸易好几十年以来第一次出超了：出口超过入口百分之九点五。主要入口货品，是中国工业发展所必需的物品。“人民中国”杂志写道，与中国对外贸易占第一位的，是苏联和人民民主国家；它们“给予中国以友好的援助，协助它发展工业和达到经济上的独立与繁荣。”
    在国民经济恢复的同时，人民的物质福利和文化水平也在提高起来。中国劳动者的饥饿与贫困，已一去不复返了。工人的工资，伴随着工业的恢复和发展而增加。农民的生活，也进入富足的境界了。
    中国的劳动者，渴求学文化，学知识。民主政权，开办着一批又一批成人文化补习学校和文化讲习班。一九五○年，有一百零六万四千七百三十六人在提高技术知识的训练班学习。全国中小学校学生，绝大多数是劳动者的子女。中国现在有二百零一所高等学校，和十二万八千余名大学生，有四十万所中小学校，和将近三千一百万名中小学生。中国的农民，也获得了学知识和文化的广泛机会。
    中国共产党——中国工人阶级的先锋队，是中国人民所有一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者。党的队伍有五百八十万成员，乃是改造国家的主力军。以受过考验的领导者毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，联合和团结着全国人民的优秀力量，来复兴国家，使它更加繁荣起来。
    中华人民共和国政府，与过去的国民党政权截然不同；前者实行着原则上不同的，符合人民利益的对外政策。发展与苏联，与人民民主国家，与一切为和平而斗争者的友好和合作，这就是自由的中国人民所实行的对外政策。苏联和中华人民共和国之间，在经济与文化各方面，已经建立了巩固的兄弟般的平等合作关系。
    中苏两国人民的永恒友好，乃是一种不可摧毁的力量，能使新战争挑拨者的疯狂计划为之粉碎。
    政务院周恩来总理写道：“中苏两国的伟大同盟，是反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的兄弟同盟。中苏两国是世界上两个强大国家，并拥有七万万团结一致的人民，他们结为坚固的同盟，就成为世界上不可战胜的力量。这个力量的结成，不仅大大地加强了世界和平民主阵营的优势，并且使帝国主义集团在东方的侵略政策和战争政策遭受严重的打击”。
    中国人民为巩固和平而积极地斗争。在世界和平理事会呼吁五强缔结和平公约的宣言上征集签名运动，在中华人民共和国获得了非常的成功。到七月底时，约有三亿四千四百万中国人，即全国人口百分之七十以上，签名拥护这一宣言；约有三亿四千万人，投票反对武装日本。中国人民签名拥护缔结和平公约和投票反对日本重新军国主义化，就证实了自己坚决地澈底地维护和平。对于美帝国主义武装干涉朝鲜，中国人民的回答是更加团结自己的队伍，更进一步扩大和平运动。
                            ×  ×  ×
    “人民中国”杂志所发表的材料，证明着年青的中华人民共和国在经济和文化上日益发展起来。在中国劳动者面前，展开了建设新生活的广阔远景。美国侵略者企图用间谍、特务和奸细来破坏中国的民主建设，是注定要失败的。
    广大的苏联社会各界，以极大的兴趣欢迎每一期“人民中国”杂志。这一杂志表明着中国人民的生活和斗争，从而促使苏联和中国两国伟大人民之间不可摧毁的永恒友谊更进一步巩固起来。
