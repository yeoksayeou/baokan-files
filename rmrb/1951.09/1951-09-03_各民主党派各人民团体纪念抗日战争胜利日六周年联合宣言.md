    The great sixth anniversary of the Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan has arrived. This great Victory Day is the result of the heroic struggle and bloodshed of the entire anti-Japanese people of our country, the People's Liberation Army of our country, and other people's anti-Japanese armed forces over the past eight years. It is the result of the unity of all democratic classes and democratic parties in our country in jointly resisting imperialist aggression and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policies. It is the result of the joint struggle of the anti-fascist people of the world in World War II, especially the generous assistance given to our country by the heroic Soviet army, which annihilated the Japanese Kwantung Army and forced the rapid surrender of the Japanese invaders.
    The great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan ended the history of the Chinese people's failures in the anti-imperialist struggle for a hundred years, and laid the foundation for the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War throughout the country. Four years after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the great People's Republic of China was proclaimed. Today, except for Taiwan, which remains to be liberated, the people of all ethnic groups in our country are celebrating the sixth anniversary of the Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan in independent, free, and happy lives. When drinking water, think of its source. We cannot but pay tribute to the soldiers and civilians who fought heroically and the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan. We cannot but pay tribute to the great commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We cannot but pay tribute to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the War of Resistance Against Japan. We cannot but pay tribute to the anti-fascist people of all countries in the world. We cannot but pay tribute to the great Soviet army and its great commander, Marshal Stalin.
    While celebrating the sixth anniversary of the Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of our country are facing new and major tasks of struggle. After World War II, American imperialism, which inherited the ambition of the German, Japanese, and Italian fascists to dominate the world and enslave the people of the world, is once again copying Japan's old tricks of invading China, threatening the happiness and security of our people. In June 1950, the U.S. government forcibly occupied Taiwan, the territory of our country, with military force, using it as a base for further aggression against our country and sabotage activities in our country. At the same time, the U.S. government launched a large-scale offensive against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, our friendly neighbor, with the obvious aim of preparing to attack mainland China. Since then, the U.S. Air Force has continuously attacked and harassed the northeast and coastal areas of our country. The U.S. government, taking advantage of its position in controlling Japan, has oppressed the Japanese people, released Japanese war criminals, and rearmed Japan, attempting to direct Japanese aggressors to once again engage in adventures to invade our country and other countries in Asia. The U.S. government and its follower, the British government, completely disregard our country's great contribution in the War of Resistance Against Japan and our country's just demands for a peace treaty with Japan, completely abandon all international agreements during World War II, are convening a peace conference with Japan in San Francisco that excludes our country, and are preparing to pass a peace treaty with Japan that endangers our country's rights and interests and threatens peace in the Far East. All of this shows that U.S. imperialism is using all direct and indirect methods to try to achieve its despicable and vicious goal of destroying our great People's Republic of China and turning our country back into a colony.
    The entire Chinese people must resolutely fight to the end to smash the U.S. imperialist aggression plan. In all current struggles, the just war of resistance against aggression by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has the greatest significance. Only by defeating the aggression of the United States and its puppet states in Korea can we defend the security of our motherland, prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression, liberate Taiwan, and safeguard peace in the Far East. Therefore, all our compatriots must do everything in their power to work with the Korean people and strive for a victorious end to the Korean war of resistance against aggression through a long-term struggle. We will never stop until we reach our goal.
    Our people's assistance to Korea in resisting aggression is originally for the purpose of seeking a just and peaceful solution to the Korean issue. In June 1951, thanks to the proposal of Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, the United States expressed its willingness to conduct armistice negotiations in Korea. Therefore, these negotiations began in Kaesong on July 10 this year. However, for almost two months, the United States displayed various arrogant and unreasonable attitudes, and on August 22 and September 1, it dispatched aircraft to drop bombs in Kaesong twice, murdering members of our delegation and undermining the progress of the armistice negotiations. Here, all democratic parties and people's organizations in China unanimously declare: We resolutely support with all our strength the solemn stand taken by the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the negotiations, and resolutely condemn the arrogant attitude and despicable atrocities of the U.S. murderers. As long as the United States does not change its attitude, all responsibility and consequences for the failure of the negotiations must be borne entirely by the United States.
    Regarding the draft peace treaty with Japan announced by the U.S. and British governments and the San Francisco conference convened by the U.S. government, Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government issued a statement on August 15, explaining our country's position. All democratic parties and people's organizations in China unanimously support Minister Zhou Enlai's statement. Representatives of all democratic parties and people's organizations in China declare on behalf of the people of the whole country: We have always advocated the rapid end to the state of war between all countries and Japan and the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan in order to establish a new peaceful and friendly relationship between the Chinese and Japanese people, but we will absolutely not recognize any peace treaty with Japan that is prepared, drafted, and signed without the participation of the People's Republic of China. We welcome the position taken by the Soviet Union, India, Burma, and the peace-loving people of the world against the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan.
    All democratic parties and people's organizations in China point out that the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the subsequent victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the signing of the great Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the People's Republic of China and the USSR, the victory of the Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the new upsurge of anti-imperialism among the people of Asian countries caused by the separate peace with Japan by the United States and Britain, all these have changed and are changing the face of Asian history. The era of imperialist rule in Asia has basically come to an end. The Asian people, who account for more than half of the human race, are engaging in the sacred struggle to overthrow imperialist oppression with overwhelming force. It is impossible for U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to reverse the wheels of history after all. Victory will surely belong to the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world who oppose imperialism.
    Long live the national heroes of the War of Resistance Against Japan!
    Long live the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War!
    Long live the victory of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression!
    Long live the great unity of the Chinese people in the struggle against imperialism!

    各民主党派各人民团体纪念抗日战争胜利日六周年联合宣言
    伟大的抗日战争胜利日六周年纪念到来了。这个伟大的胜利日，是我国全体抗日人民、我国人民解放军及其他人民抗日武装力量在八年间英勇奋斗、流血牺牲的结果，是我全国各民主阶级、民主党派团结一致共同反抗帝国主义侵略和蒋介石反动政策的结果，是全世界反法西斯的各国人民在世界第二次大战中共同奋斗，尤其是英勇的苏联军队给予我国慷慨的援助，歼灭日寇关东军，迫使日寇迅速投降的结果。
    抗日战争的伟大胜利，结束了中国人民百年间在反帝国主义斗争中失败的历史，奠定了中国人民解放战争在全国胜利的基础。在抗日战争胜利后四年，伟大的中华人民共和国就宣告成立。今天，除了台湾尚待解放以外，我全国各族人民都在独立自由幸福的生活中庆祝抗日战争胜利日的第六周年。饮水思源，我们不能不向抗日战争中英勇奋斗的军民和死难的先烈致敬，不能不向伟大的中国人民解放军将士致敬，不能不向抗日战争的伟大领导者毛泽东主席致敬，不能不向全世界反法西斯的各国人民致敬，不能不向伟大的苏联军队及其伟大统帅斯大林大元帅致敬。
    在庆祝抗日战争胜利日第六周年的时候，我国人民面临着新的重大的斗争任务。在世界第二次大战后，继承德日意法西斯企图独霸世界、奴役世界人民的美帝国主义，又在抄袭日本侵略中国的故技，威胁着我国人民的幸福和安全。美国政府在一九五○年六月用武力霸占了我国的领土台湾，用以为进
    一步侵略我国和在我国进行破坏活动的基地。美国政府同时又大举进攻我国的友好邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，其目的显然是在准备进攻我国大陆。从那时以来，美国空军不断地袭击和骚扰我国东北和沿海地方。美国政府利用管制日本的地位，压迫日本人民，释放日本战犯，重新武装日本，企图指使日本的侵略分子再一次从事侵略我国和亚洲其他国家的冒险。美国政府及其追随者英国政府完全无视我国在抗日战争中的伟大贡献和我国关于对日媾和的公正主张，完全背弃世界第二次大战期间的一切国际协议，正在旧金山召集排斥我国在外的对日和会，并且准备通过危害我国权益威胁远东和平的对日和约。凡此一切，无不表明美帝国主义正在使用一切直接间接的方法，来试图达到它的摧毁我伟大的中华人民共和国，把我国重新变为殖民地的卑鄙凶恶的目的。
    全中国人民必须为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划而坚决奋斗到底。在当前的一切奋斗中，援助朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的正义的反侵略战争有最伟大的意义。只有击败美国及其仆从国家在朝鲜的侵略，才能保卫祖国的安全，才能防止日本侵略的再起，才能解放台湾，才能维护远东和平。因此，我全国同胞，必须竭尽全力，和朝鲜人民一道，用长期的奋斗来争取朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利结束，不达目的，誓不休止。
    我国人民援助朝鲜反抗侵略，本来是为着求得朝鲜问题的公正的和平的解决。一九五一年六月，由于苏联驻联合国代表马立克的倡议，美国方面表示愿意进行在朝鲜的停战谈判，因而从今年七月十日，在开城地方开始了这一谈判。但是在差不多两个月中间，美国方面表现了各种蛮横无理的态度，并且在八月二十二日和九月一日两次派出飞机在开城投弹，谋杀我方代表团人员，破坏停战谈判的进行。中国各民主党派各人民团体在这里一致宣布：我们以一切力量坚决支持朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团在谈判中所持的严正立场，坚决谴责美国谋杀者的蛮横态度和卑鄙暴行。只要美国方面不改变他们的态度，那么，谈判失败的一切责任和后果，必须全部由美国方面担负。
    关于美英两国政府所公布的对日和约草案和美国政府所召开的旧金山会议，我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长已在八月十五日发表声明，说明了我国的立场。中国各民主党派各人民团体一致支持周恩来部长的声明。中国各民主党派各人民团体代表全国人民宣布：我们历来主张迅速结束各国与日本间的战争状态，缔结全面对日和约，以建立中日人民间新的和平友好关系，但我们绝对不承认没有中华人民共和国参加准备、拟制和签订的任何对日和约。我们欢迎苏联和印度缅甸以及世界爱好和平的人民所采取的反对美英对日和约草案的立场。
    中国各民主党派各人民团体指出：抗日战争的胜利和由此而来的中国人民解放战争的胜利，中华人民共和国和苏联间伟大的友好同盟互助条约的签订，中国人民抗美援朝斗争的胜利，美英单独对日媾和所引起的亚洲各国人民反帝国主义的新的高涨，所有这些，已经改变了并正在改变着亚洲历史的面貌。亚洲的帝国主义统治时代已经基本上完结了，占全人类半数以上的亚洲人民，正在以排山倒海的力量，从事推翻帝国主义压迫的神圣斗争。美帝国主义及其走狗想要扭转历史的车轮，毕竟是不可能的。胜利必然属于反对帝国主义的中国人民、亚洲人民和世界人民。
    抗日战争中的民族英雄们万岁！
    抗日战争和人民解放战争的胜利万岁！
    朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利万岁！
    中国人民在反帝国主义斗争中的大团结万岁！
