Title: Eight Years of No Harvest, This Year We Reap

On the vast plains of the Huai River, there are many lands that have been frequently submerged in floods over the years, becoming "nine years of failure out of ten." Since the completion of the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project, these lands have generally yielded a bumper harvest this year. Yangtuan Township in Lingbi County, northeastern Anhui Province, is one such typical example.

The reporter entered Yangtuan Township when the wheat had long been harvested and the autumn crops were growing vigorously. Dense soybean leaves interspersed with white sesame flowers covered the boundless fields, and plump sorghum ears swayed in the wind; every village was dotted with haystack mounds resembling bunker groups, and many farmers had donkeys and horses quietly grazing in front of their homes.

Yangtuan Township is located on the south bank of the Sui River and was originally an extremely fertile area. The farmers in the township called it a treasure land where one year's harvest could last for two years. Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breached the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou, ruining the Huai River system and turning the Sui River into a paralyzed river, the floods rushing down from the upper reaches of the Sui River and the northern mountains every summer and autumn have converged near the Huitang Ditch, more than ten miles northeast of Yangtuan Township. As a result, Yangtuan Township, like thousands of other villages in the middle and lower reaches of the Sui River, was frequently flooded. A farmer from Jiangjia Village told me: "In previous years, we would see nothing but a vast expanse of white water at this time of year. Since 1943, we haven't harvested any grain in the autumn for eight years and haven't harvested wheat for three years."

"Dredge the Sui River, dredge the ditches, and happy days are ahead!" This was the slogan proposed by the farmers of Yangtuan Township themselves during the water conservancy work last winter and this spring. When more than 600 civilian laborers from the township returned after completing the first phase of the Sui River dredging project, more than 500 women, elderly people, and children led by township cadres had also dug ten drainage ditches. Therefore, the rainwater during this year's wheat season quickly flowed from the small ditches into the large ditches, and from the large ditches into the new Sui River, and then flowed out smoothly, without any damage to the wheat.

The farmers of Yangtuan Township were overjoyed when they harvested their first wheat crop after years of famine. Wan Yulan's family in Jiangjia Village had twenty mu of land that had not yielded a single grain of wheat for three years. When she harvested more than five dan of wheat this year and ground it into flour for the first time, she said to the three-year-old girl lying in her arms: "Darling! After you came out of your mother's womb, you ate refugee food for two years and relief food from the People's Government for one year. You haven't eaten wheat grown in our own field. Have a good meal today! But, you must not forget Chairman Mao's kindness!" After the wheat harvest, the farmers in the township economized and used the surplus grain to buy livestock. The number of draft animals in Yangtuan Village had been reduced to five during the famine, but has now increased to twenty-eight. A farmer named Xu Wu bought a sturdy and fat black donkey from a hundred miles away as soon as he finished harvesting the wheat. He stroked the donkey's furry back and said: "Partner! I had to pull the plow and cultivate the land with my own shoulders for four or five years. I'll have to trouble you this year when planting."

Now, Yangtuan Township has mobilized more than 800 farmers to intensify the efforts to eliminate locusts, and the forty-three labor mutual aid teams in the township have also been reorganized in time and are busy harvesting sorghum. Farmer Gu Jixiang held a sorghum ear as if saying to a long-lost friend: "Hey! It's been eight years since we last met!" His brother Gu Jiyou interjected: "Brother! We still have to control the river this year! One river control gives us a good harvest for one year. If we control all the rivers, won't our lives be even better?"

    八年不收今年收
    新华社记者  朱敏信
    在千里淮河平原上，有许多历年来经常浸在大水中成为“十年九不收”的土地，这些土地，自根治淮河第一期工程完成后，今年普遍丰收了。皖东北灵璧县杨疃乡就是其中一个普通例子。
    记者进入杨疃乡是在麦子早已归仓秋禾生长旺盛的时候。密茂的豆叶夹着白色的芝麻花覆盖着无际的原野，肥硕的高粱穗在迎风摆动；每个村庄都耸立着像碉堡群似的草堆，好多农户的门前都有驴马在静静地吃草。
    杨疃乡位于濉河的南岸，原来是一块极其丰饶的地方，乡里农民称它为收一年可以吃两年的宝地。自蒋匪在黄河花园口掘堤，淮河水系败坏，濉河成为一条瘫痪的河流之后，每年夏秋之间，从濉河上游和北部山地奔腾而来的洪水，都汇集在靠杨疃乡东北十多里的浍溏沟附近。因此，杨疃乡和濉河中、下游其他千万个村庄一样，经常为洪水淹没。姜家村一个农民告诉我：“往年这时候，俺们这里都是一眼望不到边的白茫茫大水，打从一九四三年起俺们已有八年秋季没有收粒粮，三个年头没有收到麦了。”
    “扒好濉河扒好沟，快活日子在后头！”这是杨疃乡农民在去冬与今春治水时自己提出的口号。当全乡六百多民工做完第一期濉河疏浚工程回来的时候，乡里干部率领的五百多妇女、老人和儿童也扒好了十条排水的沟洫。因此，今年麦季的雨水很快从小沟流入大沟，从大沟流入新濉河内，然后顺畅流出，麦子丝毫无损。
    杨疃乡农民在连年灾荒之后收到第一季麦子时，都高兴得喜笑颜开。姜家庄万玉兰家有二十亩地已三年未收到一粒麦，当她今年收到五石多小麦第一次磨面时，她对着躺在她怀里的三岁小女孩说：“乖乖！你从妈妈肚子里出来后，二年吃的逃荒粮，一年吃的人民政府的救济粮，就没有吃过自己地里长的麦，今天好好吃一顿吧！可是，你莫要忘记毛主席的恩情呀！”麦收以后，乡里农民们都省吃俭用，把多余的粮食去买牲畜。杨疃村的耕畜在灾荒中曾减至五头，现在已增加到二十八头。一位叫许五的农民刚收好麦，就到百里之外买回一头结实肥壮的黑驴，他不时抚摩着毛茸茸的驴背说：“伙计！俺四五年都是用自己的肩头拉犁耕地，今年种地时可要麻烦你了。”
    现在，杨疃乡动员了八百多农民正加紧扑灭秋蝗，全乡四十三个劳动互助组也及时进行了整理，忙着收割高粱。农民顾纪香拿着一根高粱穗好像对着久别重逢的朋友说：“喂！八年未见了！”他兄弟顾纪友插嘴说：“哥哥！俺们今年还要去治河呀！治了一次河，就收到一年好庄稼，把河统统治好了，俺们的日子不是更好过吗？”
