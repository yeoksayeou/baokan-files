Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 6th: The spokesperson of our Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation issued the following statement regarding the issue of the full release of the correspondence between the two sides by the Ridgway Headquarters:

    In order to deny the major responsibility it should bear for its recent series of acts of sabotaging the Kaesong armistice negotiations, the United Nations Command is resorting to various methods to conceal the full picture and truth of the incidents, in order to deceive the people of the world. One prominent example is the United Nations Command's evasion of the responsibility to fully and completely publish the formal documents submitted by our side to the United Nations Command regarding the truth of the facts in the process of bilateral correspondence.

    In the reply from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to General Ridgway on August 27, it was stated: "In order to enable the people of the world to understand the full picture and truth of the incident, we request that you, like our side, publish the full texts of the correspondence between you and us, and allow your news agencies to send them out in full and newspapers in various places to publish them in full." General Ridgway did not reply to this point. The so-called statement by the United Nations Command Headquarters on September 3, which mentioned that the United Nations Command side "never withheld the publication of documents related to accusations of violating the Kaesong neutrality," also evaded the crux of the issue. The issue now is not whether or not to withhold these relevant documents, but that the United Nations Command Headquarters itself has not fulfilled the responsibility of fully publishing all the correspondence between the two sides through its own news release agencies.

    According to verifiable records, up to now, the United Nations Command Headquarters has, in most cases, either divided, deleted, and not fully published our side's documents, or only fully published a few pieces after strict selection, or has not published them at all.

    The statement from the United Nations Command Headquarters also confirms the fact that it has not fully published our side's documents. According to the statement issued by the United Nations Command Headquarters on September 3, which is quoted above, twenty-five formal letters were exchanged between the two sides from August 4 to September 1, including three letters from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to General Ridgway, all of which the United Nations Command Headquarters "had released to the public." Now, without discussing whether the United Nations Command Headquarters has fully published these twenty-five documents since August 4, and regardless of why the United Nations Command Headquarters avoids mentioning anything before August 4, at least two of our documents were not published by them during this period. Because between August 4 and September 1, Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai sent a total of five letters to General Ridgway (issued on August 6, 9, 23, 27, and September 1), not three.

    Regarding the issue that the United Nations Command has not fully published our side's documents, the following example is particularly sufficient to serve as a typical illustration, that is, the fact that the notification from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to General Ridgway on July 14, regarding allowing reporters to enter the Kaesong area in order to avoid hindering the progress of the armistice negotiations on trivial issues, has never been fully published by the United Nations Command Headquarters. According to a broadcast by the U.S. military radio station in Tokyo on July 15, "Officials at the United Nations forward base did not know about the reply from Pyongyang Radio until newspaper reporters received the information from their Tokyo office and told them." A United Press dispatch on July 15 even frankly admitted: "(United Nations Command superiors) have issued an order saying that news regarding the Communists' acceptance of General Ridgway's conditions (referring to allowing reporters to enter the Kaesong area) must not be announced to (United Nations) troops."

    Are the above examples, based on facts known to the whole world, not enough to prove that the United Nations Command Headquarters has evaded the responsibility of fully publishing all the correspondence between the two sides?

    From this, fair-minded people will naturally draw the conclusion that the United Nations Command Headquarters, on the one hand, is trying every means to create provocative incidents to undermine the progress of the armistice negotiations, and on the other hand, is deliberately and maliciously evading the responsibility of fully publishing all the correspondence between the two sides, and is adopting methods of dividing, deleting, or only publishing our documents in full after strict selection, or even not publishing them at all, in order to distort our position and主張, to conceal the full picture and truth of the provocative incidents they have created, which in reality they cannot conceal.

### 我方代表团发言人发表谈话  揭露美方不敢公布双方往来文电  妄图掩盖其制造挑衅事件的真相

    我方代表团发言人发表谈话
    揭露美方不敢公布双方往来文电  妄图掩盖其制造挑衅事件的真相
    【新华社开城六日电】我朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军代表团发言人，特就李奇微总部关于双方来往文电的全文发布问题，发表如下谈话：
    联合国军方面为了抵赖其最近一连串的破坏开城停战谈判的行为所应负的重大责任，不惜用种种办法来掩盖事件的全貌和真相，以欺骗世界人民。其显著的例证之一，就是联合国军方面在双方文电交往过程中对于我方就事实真相向联合国军提出的正式文件，逃避了全部和全文公布的责任。
    金日成彭德怀两将军八月二十七日致李奇微将军的复文中称：“为使全世界人民能够明了事件的全貌和真相，我们要求你，能和我方一样，将你我双方来往的文电全文发表，并容许你方各新闻通讯社全文发出和各地报纸全文登载。”对于这点，李奇微将军并未答复。联合国军总部九月三日的声明中所提到的所谓联合国军方面“从未扣住有关指责违反开城中立的文件不予发表”等语，亦闪避了问题的症结所在。现在的问题不是扣住不扣住这些有关文件的问题，而是联合国军总部自己没有负起通过它自己的新闻发布机关将双方来往的所有文电全文公布的责任。
    根据有纪录可查的，到现在为止，联合国军总部处理我方正式文件，在大多数的情况下，是将我方的文电或者是加以割裂、删改而不是全文公布，或者是经过严格的选择才全文公布了几件，或者是完全不予公布。
    联合国军总部的声明也证实了它没有全部全文公布我方文件的事实。据上引九月三日联合国军总部所发表的声明中所提到的，八月四日至九月一日双方之间交换了二十五项正式函件，其中包括金日成、彭德怀两将军致李奇微将军的函件三件，联合国军总部“都曾向公众发表”。现在姑且不论联合国军总部从八月四日起有没有全文公布过这二十五个文件，更不论联合国军总部为什么避开八月四日以前不谈，但就在联合国军总部所指的这期间内至少有两个我方文件是他们没有公布的。因为八月四日至九月一日之间，金日成、彭德怀两将军给李奇微将军的函件一共有五件（发出的日期为八月六日、九日、二十三日、二十七日及九月一日），而不是三件。
    关于联合国军没有全文发表我方文电的问题，下述的例证尤其足以作典型性的说明，那就是金日成彭德怀两将军七月十四日就避免在枝节问题上妨碍停战谈判进行而准许记者进入开城地区致李奇微将军的通知，始终没有被联合国军总部全文公布的事实。据美军东京军中电台七月十五日广播，“联合国前进基地的官员们一直不知道平壤电台的回答，直到新闻记者从他们的东京办事处得到这消息并转告他们，才知道。”美国合众社七月十五日电更坦然承认：“（联合国军上级）已有命令说，关于共产党接受李奇微将军的条件（按指准许记者进入开城地区）的消息，不得向（联合国）部队宣布。”
    以上这几个以全世界周知的事实为基础的例证还不够证明联合国军总部逃避了全文公布双方来往的所有文件的责任么？
    由此，公正的人们自然会得出这样的结论，那就是：联合国军总部一方面百般设法制造挑衅事件破坏停战谈判的进行，另一方面又故意和恶意地逃避全文公布双方来往的所有文电的责任，并对我方文件采用割裂、删节或经过严格选择才全文发表，或竟不发表的办法，来歪曲我方的立场和主张，来掩盖而其实又无法掩盖的他们制造的挑衅事件的全貌和真相。
