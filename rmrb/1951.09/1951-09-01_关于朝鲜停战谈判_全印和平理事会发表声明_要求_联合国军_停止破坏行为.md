Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 31st: The Secretariat of the All-India Peace Council issued a statement on the Kaesong armistice negotiations, stating that the Korean armistice negotiations are being delayed, and there is a danger that the negotiations will fall into a stalemate. American aircraft continue to conduct barbarous bombings against civilians and use poison gas bombs and bacteria. The UN forces have even launched offensives recently while the peace talks are still continuing. All of this has caused serious concern among people all over the world.

The statement continued: The Secretariat of the All-India Peace Council demands that the UN Command stop the air raids on unarmed civilians and stop its offensive actions; if these offensive actions continue, the hope of establishing peace in Korea at an early date will surely be dashed. The Secretariat also demands an immediate and impartial investigation into the UN forces' use of poison gas bombs and bacteriological warfare against the Korean people.

    关于朝鲜停战谈判
    全印和平理事会发表声明
    要求“联合国军”停止破坏行为
    【新华社新德里三十一日电】全印和平理事会秘书处就开城停战谈判发表声明称：朝鲜停战谈判在拖延时日，谈判有陷于僵局的危险；美国飞机对老百姓继续进行野蛮的轰炸，并使用毒气弹和细菌。联合国军最近甚至在和谈还在继续进行的时候发动攻势。这一切引起了全世界人们严重的忧虑。
    声明继称：全印和平理事会秘书处要求联合国军司令部停止对手无寸铁的老百姓进行空袭，并停止其攻势行动；这种攻势行动如果继续下去，一定会使早日在朝鲜建立和平的希望归于破灭。秘书处还要求对联合国军使用毒气弹和细菌攻击朝鲜人民一事立即进行公正的调查。
