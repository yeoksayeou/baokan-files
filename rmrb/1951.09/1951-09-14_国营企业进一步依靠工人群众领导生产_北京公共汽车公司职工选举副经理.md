    State-Owned Enterprises Further Rely on the Masses of Workers to Lead Production
    Beijing Public Bus Company Employees Elect Deputy Managers
    On September 4th, the workers of the Beijing Public Bus Company elected two deputy managers from among the company's workers and technical personnel, recommending them to higher leading organs for appointment. This election of deputy managers by workers is a first in Beijing. This election provides an important lesson for the democratic management of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing.
    Since liberation, the bus company has achieved progress in restoring and developing production due to the efforts of its employees. At the time of liberation, only five buses in the company were operational; now, more than eighty buses can be dispatched daily. Costs and breakdown rates have also gradually decreased. However, because the company's manager and secretary of the Chinese Communist Party General Branch, Sun Xun, deputy manager and member of the General Branch Committee, Yang Miao, and deputy secretary of the General Branch, Ka Di, did not earnestly rely on the workers and did not correctly implement the Party and government's policy of uniting with technical personnel, the company's business has not achieved its due development. They do not value the enterprise management committee: they do not inform the committee members of the meeting's content before the meeting, they do not listen to the committee members' opinions during the meeting, and they do not implement the meeting's resolutions after the meeting. Therefore, the management committee exists in name only, and many employees still do not understand what the management committee does. They also do not value the political education and cultural learning of employees, do not care about the welfare of workers, do not value the opinions of workers, and do not help technical personnel politically. When the company issues awards, it does not hold large meetings; when dismissing workers, it only issues a notice, without conducting education among the masses of employees. Workers' requests to open windows in dormitories and for water bottles for road workers have been delayed administratively. Some workers' rationalization proposals have not received replies for months. Comrades Sun Xun, Yang Miao, and Ka Di also have serious disunity, unable to conduct serious discussions at the General Branch Committee meetings and engaging in unprincipled disputes; at the same time, the democratic style within the Party is insufficient; thus, the Party cannot effectively play its role in supervising and guaranteeing production. Due to these serious shortcomings in leadership, the enthusiasm of employees has been greatly damaged, and various systems cannot be effectively implemented. Buses cannot run on time and often break down on the road. Many citizens have expressed dissatisfaction with the company. The Municipal People's Government Public Utilities Bureau and newspapers have continuously received criticisms of the company from citizens. Representatives of the Municipal People's Representative Conference have also raised criticisms at the meetings. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government Public Utilities Bureau have repeatedly given education and assistance to Comrades Sun Xun, Ka Di, and Yang Miao. However, they have not humbly accepted it. They do not seriously consider the criticisms from newspapers and the masses of workers. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that Comrades Sun Xun, Ka Di, and Yang Miao are not competent for the leadership work of the General Branch Committee and decided to re-elect the General Branch Committee. The Municipal People's Government Public Utilities Bureau decided to replace the company's manager and deputy managers, with the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Jia Tingsan, concurrently serving as the company's manager. The two deputy managers will be elected by the workers, recommended by the trade union, and then reviewed and appointed by the higher authorities.
    The company's trade union accepted the proposal of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government Public Utilities Bureau and convened a meeting of employee representatives on September 4th. Responsible comrades from the Party, government, and trade union of major state-owned factories and enterprises in Beijing also attended. Jia Tingsan, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Lu Yu, chief of the Factory Branch Work Section of the Organization Department of the Municipal Committee, reported on the results of the inspection of the company's work at the meeting. Zhang Hongshun, vice chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke. They all pointed out that it is very good to adopt such a method of determining the company's leadership candidates by workers' election, trade union recommendation, and administrative appointment in factories and enterprises where it is needed and conditions permit. Administrative leaders elected in this way will certainly be more easily connected to the masses; the masses of workers can also have a greater sense of ownership. They also pointed out that some people may have concerns, fearing that managers elected from among the workers may not be competent. In fact, workers elected as administrative leaders initially lack experience in management work. However, because they can connect with the masses and can receive the active help of the masses, this shortcoming can certainly be quickly compensated for. When the Qinghe Woolen Mill carried out democratic reforms this spring, workers elected workshop directors. So far, the vast majority have been working very well. Only a few are slightly worse. The workers said, "It doesn't matter. If he really doesn't work, we'll elect another one!" The employee representatives warmly supported the above opinions. During group discussions, they unanimously agreed that the opinions of Comrades Jia Tingsan, Lu Yu, and Zhang Hongshun were correct, and only in this way can the company's work be rapidly improved. They also used many concrete facts to supplement the various shortcomings pointed out in the report. When discussing the candidates for deputy manager in each group, the representatives repeatedly compared their nominated candidates, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, each group unanimously nominated and passed the trade union chairman, Gao Feng, and engineer, Zhu Lin, as deputy managers.
    After the election, five representatives excitedly expressed their feelings on the spot, unanimously pledging to support the leaders they had elected by doing a good job. Gao Feng also expressed his feelings. He said, "I feel very honored to be elected as deputy manager. This is the honor of the working class, the honor of the Party. I have confidence in doing a good job because I have the support of all the company's employees and the leadership of our Party and administration." The heads of other factories and enterprises also said that they had received a profound education from attending this conference and further understood the importance of relying on the masses. They unanimously supported this good method of workers' election, trade union recommendation, and administrative appointment. Cui Ziru, deputy director of the No. 1 Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, said, "Our factory is short of a lathe operator foreman, and we can't find a suitable person no matter how hard we look. Now we have a solution. We will go back and ask the workers to elect one themselves." (Lu Niangao, Ye Zuxing)

    国营企业进一步依靠工人群众领导生产
    北京公共汽车公司职工选举副经理
    北京公共汽车公司工人在九月四日从公司的工人和技术人员里，选举出两位副经理，推荐给上级领导机关任命。工人选举副经理，在北京这还是第一次。这次选举，给北京市公营工矿企业的民主管理工作上了重要的一课。
    汽车公司从解放到现在，由于职工的努力，在恢复和发展生产方面是有成绩的。在刚一解放时，公司里能开动的汽车只有五辆，到现在已经能每天出车八十多辆。成本和坏车率也都逐渐减低。但是因为公司的经理兼中国共产党总支部书记孙逊、副经理兼总支部委员杨渺、总支部副书记卡笛等，没有认真地依靠工人，没有正确地执行党和政府团结技术人员的政策，所以公司的业务还没有得到应有的发展。他们不重视企业管理委员会：会前不把会议的内容告诉给管委会的委员们，开会时不听取委员们的意见，会后不贯彻会上的决议。因此，管委会有名无实，很多职工到现在还弄不清管委会是干什么的。他们也不重视职工的政治教育和文化学习，不关心工人的福利，不重视工人的意见，不从政治上帮助技术人员。公司发奖时不开大会，开除工人也只出一纸布告，都不在职工群众中进行教育。工人要求在宿舍开窗子，车路工人要把水壶，行政上都拖着不办。有的工人提出了合理化建议，几个月得不到答覆。孙逊、杨渺和卡笛三位同志还有严重的不团结现象，在总支部委员会上不能展开严肃的讨论，而闹无原则的纠纷；同时，党内民主作风不够；因而使党不能很好地发挥监督保证生产的作用。由于领导上有这些严重的缺点，所以职工的积极性受到很大的损害，各项制度也不能很好地贯彻下去。行车不能正点，而且时常在半路抛锚。很多市民对该公司表示不满。市人民政府公用局和报社都不断接到市民对该公司的批评。市各界人民代表会议的代表们也在会上提出过批评。中共北京市委员会和市人民政府公用局对孙逊、卡笛、杨渺三位同志，曾经多次给以教育和帮助。但是他们没有虚心接受。他们更不认真考虑报纸和工人群众的批评。因此，中共北京市委员会认为孙逊、卡笛和杨渺三位同志不能胜任总支委员会的领导工作，决定改选总支委员会。市人民政府公用局决定撤换公司的经理、副经理，由公用局贾庭三局长兼任公司的经理。副经理两人，由工人选举、工会推荐、再由上级审核委任。
    公司工会接受中共北京市委员会和市人民政府公用局的提议，在九月四日召开了职工代表大会。北京各大公营工厂企业的党、政、工负责同志也都列席。公用局局长贾庭三和市委组织部工厂支部工作科科长陆禹，在会上报告了检查公司工作的结果。市总工会副主席张鸿舜也讲了话。他们都指出：在有需要、有条件的工厂企业里，采取像这样的由工人选举、工会推荐、行政任命的方法来确定公司的领导人选，是非常好的。这样选出来的行政负责人，一定更容易联系群众；工人群众也更可以有主人翁的感觉。他们还指出：可能有些人有顾虑，怕从工人里选出来的经理不能称职。实际上，工人当选行政负责人以后，初期是缺乏管理工作的经验的。但是因为他们能联系群众，能够得到群众的积极的帮助，所以这个缺点一定能很快地弥补过来。清河制呢厂今年春天在进行民主改革时，曾经由工人选出工长。到现在为止，绝大部分都工作得很好。只有个别的差一些。工人说：“没关系。他实在不行，我们再选一个！”职工代表们热烈拥护上述意见。在分组讨论时，他们一致认为贾庭三、陆禹、张鸿舜三位同志的意见是正确的，只有这样才能迅速改进公司的工作。他们还用很多具体事实补充了报告中所指出的各项缺点。各组在讨论副经理人选时，代表们对自己提出的候选人，反覆地加以比较，指出他们的优点和缺点。最后，各组一致提名并通过工会主席高峰和工程师朱临为副经理。
    在选举结束后，当场有五位代表兴奋地发表感想，一致表示保证用搞好工作来拥护自己选出来的领导者。高峰也发表了感想。他说：“我当选副经理，感觉到非常光荣。这是工人阶级的光荣，党的光荣。我有信心搞好工作，因为有全公司的职工，有我们的党和行政的领导作我的靠山。”其他工厂企业的负责人也说参加这次大会得到了深刻的教育，进一步明白了依靠群众的重要性。他们一致拥护这个工人选举、工会推荐、行政任命的好办法。华北农业机器厂第一分厂崔子儒副厂长说：“我们厂子里缺一个车工工长，怎么找也找不到合适的人。这回有办法了。回去请工人们自己选一个。”（卢念高、叶祖兴）
