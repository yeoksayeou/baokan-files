    Shaanxi Guanzhong Area
    Launches Patriotic Cotton Protection Campaign
    Guaranteeing Supply of Raw Materials for the Textile Industry
    One of the nation's renowned cotton-producing areas, the cotton farmers in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi are enthusiastically launching a patriotic cotton protection campaign. This competition was initiated in mid-July by three mutual aid teams, including Zhang Mingliang's team in Xingping County, and has now received enthusiastic responses from 771 mutual aid teams in six counties including Chang'an, Xianyang, Weinan, Jingyang, Sanyuan, and Gaoling. These mutual aid teams, while challenging Zhang Mingliang's and the other two mutual aid teams, have also challenged mutual aid teams in their own areas, thus rapidly forming this competition into a regional chain competition. As of now, more than 2,000 mutual aid teams have participated in the chain competition.

    These participating mutual aid teams are taking the prevention and control of various natural disasters, ensuring a bumper cotton harvest; the widespread selection and retention of superior cotton varieties; timely harvesting of cotton; and guaranteeing the supply of industrial raw materials to the state as the main conditions for the competition. Currently, inspection teams or inspection committees for the patriotic cotton protection campaign have been established in various parts of the area to urge the mutual aid teams to conscientiously implement the competition plan.

    Since the launch of the competition, cotton farmers in the Guanzhong area have made great progress in eliminating cotton aphids and have universally applied topdressing fertilizer to cotton fields and increased the area of irrigated cotton fields. For example, the seventeen mutual aid teams led by Yang Xiqing, a model cotton grower in Jingyang County, in addition to timely watering for the more than 800 mu of cotton fields of each team, also dug eleven new wells, expanding the irrigated area of cotton fields by more than 80 mu.

    陕西关中地区
    展开爱国保棉竞赛
    保证供给纺织工业原料
    全国著名产棉区之一——陕西关中地区的棉农，正在热烈展开爱国保棉的竞赛运动。这一竞赛是由兴平县张明亮等三个互助组于七月中旬所发起，现已得到长安、咸阳、渭南、泾阳、三原、高陵等六县的七百七十一个互助组的热烈响应。这些互助组在向张明亮等三个互助组应战的同时，又向本地区的互助组提出挑战，从而使这一竞赛迅速形成为区域性的连环竞赛，截至目前止参加连环竞赛的互助组已达两千多个。
    这些参加竞赛的互助组，都将防治各种自然灾害，确保棉花丰收；普遍选留棉花良种；及时收摘棉花，并保证供给国家工业原料等，作为主要竞赛条件。现该区各地已成立了爱国保棉竞赛的检查小组或检查委员会，以督促各互助组认真执行竞赛计划。
    竞赛展开后，关中地区的棉农已在除治棉蚜的工作上得到很大成绩，并普遍为棉田施了追肥，增加了棉田浇水面积。如泾阳县植棉模范杨锡庆所领导的十七个互助组，除为各组的八百多亩棉田及时浇了水以外，还新打井十一眼，扩大棉田灌溉面积八十多亩。（新华社）
