    After the Huai River flooded last year, Chairman Mao made the determination to "fundamentally harness the Huai River." At that time, I was a fourth-year student at Nanjing University, standing at my study post, ready to answer the call of the motherland at any time. When the school called on us to participate in this great Huai River project, I signed up with great excitement. In this year, I have learned a lot.
    The Broad Masses in the Huai River Basin
    Urgently Demanded the Fundamental Harnessing of the Huai River
    When I first arrived at the Huai River, I was deeply moved by hearing many reports about the suffering of the broad masses in the Huai River basin from the floods. However, because I had always lived in the city, enjoying a relatively comfortable life, and had little contact with the countryside, my understanding was not very profound. At the end of last year, when Comrade Li Xuebi and I went to Xincai, Henan, to survey the Li Da Lake depression, we truly came into contact with the rural areas affected by the disaster. This was a vast plain of yellow earth, and not even a single sorghum stalk could be found inside or outside the villages. Walking along the lake dike, we saw many breaches; brick-built sluice gates were destroyed; countless houses were washed away, leaving only a foundation; the scene was extremely desolate. We contacted the local township government and began to investigate and study. Once, in Houwanglou Village, we met an old farmer. When we asked him about the flooding, he immediately burst into tears. He said that he had not harvested a single grain of wheat or a single cotton boll in nine years. I told the old man that Chairman Mao was very concerned about everyone's suffering and had decided to harness the Huai River well. Upon hearing this, the old man immediately smiled. An old woman said, "Chairman Mao is making decisions for us, overthrowing the landlords, distributing land, and now leading us to overthrow the water tyrant! We have truly turned ourselves around!" This sentence is the common voice of the farmers in the disaster area of Henan. When we were working, we stayed in the township government. They took special care of us and let us eat buckwheat noodles. To me, this stuff was slippery and difficult to eat, but it was the best food in the village. Several times, when we went out to investigate and did not have time to return to the township government for meals, we took our wheat tickets to the homes of the masses to bother them. They always apologized to us and said, "Comrades, you are suffering! If we hadn't been flooded, we would have treated you to white flour dumplings!" From these facts, we can see how urgent the masses in the rural areas of Henan, where land reform had already been completed, were in demanding water management! How wise and correct was Chairman Mao's decision! Although what I saw was only a corner of the disaster area, it left a deep impression on me.
    The Party's Leadership and the Strength of the Masses
    Are the Basic Conditions for Harnessing the Huai River Well
    The Huai River project has already achieved great results in one year. We did not have rich construction experience, no large amount of equipment, and especially no sufficient hydrological records to grasp the laws of water situation changes, but we have achieved victory. What is the reason for this? The main reason is that we have two most basic and decisive conditions, that is, the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the infinite wisdom and enthusiastic labor of the broad masses. Chairman Mao made a great and solemn call to us: "We must repair the Huai River well!" This call penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people, making us think at all times of the great mission we bear, and thus we were able to work day and night, without fear of fatigue. With the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the wisdom of the working people was constantly being discovered and concentrated. The masses are truly the most brilliant water managers. They are not only familiar with the water conditions, but also often have quite mature opinions on engineering planning. When surveying Li Da Lake, we planned to find a culvert location at the Shun Port of the lake. As we were groping on the dike of the Ru River, two farmers automatically ran over and, pointing to the lush Ru River, told us how the river water rose during the flood season, how it backfilled into Shun Port, and how it destroyed the river dikes. Because the bottom of the port was very steep, they suggested that the culvert should be built one kilometer away from the port, and explained how it should be connected to the surrounding hills and river dikes. I recorded their words in detail and discussed them with my superiors. The results proved that their suggestions were very much in line with scientific principles and were simply an extremely brilliant and practical plan. When building the Banqiao Reservoir, we did drilling work at three different dam sites, but we still did not get satisfactory results. When the masses saw us drilling here and there, they automatically ran over to tell us about a route, which happened to be in the middle of the two dam axes we had drilled. According to their experience, every year after the flood, ox carts would not sink only if they crossed the river on this road. We adopted this suggestion and successfully completed the dam axis alignment. In this way, the working people used their wisdom to make up for our lack of experience and insufficient data. In the large project of Banqiao Reservoir, I saw 30,000 laborers, using various tools, sending soil to the dam surface in an orderly manner, just like an organized and disciplined corps conducting an intense and fierce battle. I have not been working in the revolution for a long time, and when I first arrived at the reservoir, I did not have much confidence. Under the education of these facts, my confidence in my work grew.
    Technical Personnel Must Combine with the Masses and Learn from the Masses
    In the Huai River project, I realized that in order for a technical cadre to serve the people well, he must first strengthen his political understanding. Many of our technical cadres have a very high enthusiasm for work in the Huai River project. Regardless of ice, snow, wind, or rain, regardless of day or night, everyone can bury their heads in hard work. However, because most of us are intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins, our political training is not enough. Therefore, in our work, we often cannot grasp the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method. Many of us often mistakenly regard the people's cause as our own personal cause. When we participate in the great Huai River project, we first feel that our skills have a "hero's place to use." Starting from this individualistic ideological viewpoint, some technical leading cadres have generated masterpiece thoughts, or are fond of grand achievements, and are eager to achieve success regardless of objective conditions, and want to use adventurous methods to seek personal achievements, and so on. Like me, a person who has just come out of school to engage in technical work, I express myself by emphasizing interest, always wanting to go to water conservancy projects with many people and strong technicality, and not wanting to go to dredging or ditch projects with few people and a lot of earthwork. When carrying out work, I only care about my own part, and cannot look at the problem from the needs of the entire project. For example, when I participated in the design work of the depression storage project, I only paid attention to the problems within the depression, and ignored the problems outside the depression. When I participated in the river regulation work, I only managed the section I was regulating, and did not consider what impact this work would have on the upstream and downstream. A more serious problem is that I only believe in book knowledge and do not believe in the masses. For example, when applying hydrological data, we always think that the flood marks pointed out by the masses are unreliable (of course, some are also unreliable), but when we get the records left over from the Kuomintang reactionary rule, we think they are true and never doubt them again. For the experience, formulas or construction methods in books, we also use them as soon as we get them, regardless of whether they meet objective conditions. If these erroneous ideas of our technical staff were without the correct leadership of the Communist Party, if we did not have the help and education of the working people with their rich wisdom and experience, then we would unknowingly create many disasters for the people. I deeply realize that if a technical staff member only has skills, does not work hard to transform himself, improve himself, and does not learn to grasp the Marxist stand, viewpoint, and method, then he will be like a sailboat without a rudder, drifting with the wind, unable to find the direction of navigation, and unable to complete the mission assigned to us by Chairman Mao.

    党的领导和群众的智慧保证了治淮的胜利
    ——一个大学生参加治淮工作后的体会与感想
    吴兆麟
    去年淮河泛滥成灾以后，毛主席下了“根治淮河”的决心。当时我是南京大学四年级的学生，站在学习岗位上，随时等待着祖国的召唤。当学校里号召我们去参加这一伟大的治淮工作时，我以极兴奋的心情报了名。这一年中，我学到了很多东西。
    淮河流域广大群众
    迫切要求根治淮河
    初到淮河，听到许多关于淮河流域广大群众所受洪水灾害的报告，我心里很受感动；但因为我一向生长在城市里，过着比较舒适的生活，和农村很少接触，所以体会得很不深刻。去年年底，我和李学泌同志到河南新蔡查勘李大湖洼地时，才真正接触到被灾的农村。这是一片辽阔的黄土平原，村子内外，连一根高粱秆也找不出来。沿着湖堤走去，看到很多缺口；砖砌的闸洞被冲毁了；无数房屋被冲得只剩下一个墙脚；景况十分凄惨。我们和当地的乡政府取得联系，就着手调查研究。有一次，在后王楼村遇到一个年老的农民，我们问他水淹的情况，他立刻哭起来了。他说，他已有九年没有收过一粒麦子和一朵棉花了。我告诉这位老人，毛主席对大家的痛苦非常关心，已经下决心要把淮河治好。听到这话，老人立刻笑了。一个老妈妈说：“毛主席替咱们作主，打倒了地主，分了地，如今又领导咱们打倒水恶霸，咱们可真的翻身了！”这句话是河南灾区农民的共同声音。我们进行工作时，宿在乡政府里。他们特别照顾我们，让我们吃荞麦面馍。在我说来，这东西滑溜溜的很难吃，但这是村里最好的伙食了。有几次，我们出去调查，来不及赶回乡政府吃饭，便拿了麦票到群众家里去打扰。他们总是很抱歉地对我们说：“同志，苦了你们呀！要不是被水淹了，要请你们吃白面水饺呀！”从这些事实可以看到，在土地改革已经完成的河南农村，群众对于治水的要求是何等迫切！毛主席的决定是何等英明正确！我看到的虽然仅仅是灾区的一角，却已经给我留下深刻的印象。
    党的领导和群众的力量
    是治好淮河的基本条件
    一年的治淮工作，已经获得了巨大的成绩。我们没有丰富的建设经验，没有大量的器材设备，尤其是没有足够的水文记录，以掌握水情变化的规律，但是，我们取得了胜利。这是什么原因呢？主要是我们具备了两个最基本的决定性的条件，这就是共产党、毛主席的英明领导，和广大群众的无穷智慧与热情劳动。毛主席向我们作了一个伟大而严肃的号召：“一定要把淮河修好”！这个号召深入人心，使我们时时刻刻想到自己担负的伟大使命，因而能够不分日夜、不怕疲劳地进行工作。有了党和毛主席的英明领导，劳动人民的智慧就不断被发掘和集中起来。群众真是最高明的治水家，他们不但熟悉水情，对于工程规划常常也有相当成熟的意见。勘查李大湖时，我们拟在该湖顺港口寻找一个涵闸位置。我们正在汝河的堤上摸索着，有两个农民自动地跑来，指着绿盈盈的汝河，告诉我们：在汛期河水怎样上涨，怎样倒灌进顺港，怎样冲毁河堤。因为港底很陡，他向我们建议涵闸应该造在离开港口
    一公里的地方，并说明应该如何与左右的岗地和河堤连接起来。我把他们的话详细记录下来，回来和上级讨论，结果证明他们的建议非常符合科学原理，简直是一个极高明的切合实际的规划。在修板桥水库时，我们做了三个不同坝址的钻探工作，但还是得不到满意的结果。群众看到我们东一孔西一孔地钻，就自动跑来告诉我们一条路线，这条路线恰恰是在我们曾经钻过的两个坝轴的中间。依据他们的经验，每年洪水以后，只有从这条路过河，牛车才不会陷下去。我们吸取了这个意见，才顺利地完成了坝轴的定线。这样，劳动人民就以他们的智慧，弥补了我们经验不够、资料不足的缺陷。在板桥水库的大工程中，我看到三万民工，利用各种不同的工具，秩序井然地向坝面送土，就好像一个有组织有纪律的兵团在进行一场紧张剧烈的战斗。我参加革命工作时间不长，初到水库时，信心是不大的，在这些事实教育下，我的工作信心生长起来了。
    技术人员必须和群众结合，向群众学习
    我在治淮工作中认识到，一个技术干部，要能很好地为人民服务，首先要加强自己的政治认识。我们许多技术干部，在治淮工作中工作热情是非常高的。不管冰雪风雨，不管白昼黑夜，大家都能够埋头苦干。但由于我们大多数人都是小资产阶级出身的知识分子，在政治上的锻炼还很不够，因此，在工作中常常不能掌握马列主义的立场、观点和方法。我们很多人常常把人民的事业，错误地看成了自己个人的事业。我们参加了伟大的治淮工程，首先感到的是自己的技术有了“英雄用武之地”。从这种个人主义的思想观点出发，有些技术领导干部便产生了杰作思想，或者好大喜功，不顾主客观条件而急于求成，想用冒险的办法来求得个人的成就等等。像我这样一个刚从学校出来从事技术工作的人，便表现为强调兴趣，总想到人多、技术性强的水库工程中去，不想到人少、土方多的疏浚或沟洫工程中去。在进行工作时，我只顾自己的那一部分，不能从整个工程的需要去看问题。譬如我参加洼地蓄洪工程的设计工作，便只注意洼地以内的问题，洼地以外的问题就不管了。我参加河道整理工作，便只管自己整理的那一段，这段工作对上下游会发生什么影响，便不去考虑。更严重的问题，是只相信书本知识，不相信群众。如应用水文资料时，我们总认为群众指出的洪水痕迹不可靠（当然有些也是不可靠的），但拿到国民党反动统治时期留下来的记录，却认为千真万确，再也不去怀疑。对于书本上的经验、公式或施工方法，也是抓到就用，不管它是否符合客观条件。我们技术工作人员的这些错误思想，假如没有共产党的正确领导，假如没有劳动人民以他们丰富的智慧和经验给予我们很大的帮助和教育，那末，我们会不知不觉地给人民造下许多灾害。我深深体会到，一个技术工作人员，假如只有技术，不努力改造自己，提高自己，不学会掌握马克思主义的立场、观点、方法，那就会像一只没有舵的帆船，随风飘荡，找不到航行的方向，不能完成毛主席交给我们的使命。
