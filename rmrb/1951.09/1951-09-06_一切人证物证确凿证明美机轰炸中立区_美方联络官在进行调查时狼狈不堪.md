Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Kaesong, September 4th: Our special correspondent reported from Kaesong on the 4th regarding the embarrassing situation of the US liaison officer while investigating the bombing incident of September 1st: At 10:40 on September 1st, our side and the US liaison officer arrived at the scene of the bombing incident for a joint investigation. The two US officers responsible for the investigation were Colonel Kenny and Colonel Mulray. These two colonels are not strangers to people. After the bombing incident on August 22nd, they had also come to the scene to investigate at the request of our liaison officer. During that investigation, they were almost pushed every step of the way. As soon as they reached the first bomb crater, Kenny impatiently said, "This is not worth looking at." This time it was very different. Before the first bomb crater was fully investigated, the US liaison officer urged to see the second bomb crater, and was in a hurry to find eyewitnesses to investigate. Our liaison officer told the two colonels that in addition to investigating the local residents, there were also military police on the nearby mountains who could be called in for investigation. They shook their heads and only looked for local residents to investigate. On the way from the second bomb crater site through the first bomb crater to the village, two residents were in the rice fields collecting the remaining rice ears. The Chinese reporter thought the liaison officers would stop to investigate, but the two US colonels walked straight past them. They wanted to find residents they approved of to investigate.

During this resident investigation, the US liaison officer personally found three residents and visited a farmer's house. Kenny asked the first resident he found if he heard the sound of the plane? Did you see the plane? How did you know it was a plane bombing? The resident replied that he heard two explosions while he was sleeping, and then he heard the buzzing sound of the plane circling over his head. The resident's answer proved that the bomb crater that appeared near Damiandong at 0:30 on September 1st was indeed formed by bombs dropped from a plane. Kenny was unwilling to listen to these words, and was busy looking for a second resident to investigate. When interviewing the second resident, Kenny's Korean interpreter deliberately put on a smiling face and even took out cigarettes from his pocket to offer the resident, but the resident refused. Kenny asked the resident the same question. The resident said that after he heard the plane dropping two bombs, the plane fled south. He believed it was an American plane, and he also said that shrapnel hit his yard and damaged his windows. Kenny, who was on the side, became impatient. Before the resident finished speaking, he asked: How do you know that the plane flying south is American? Kenny originally thought that this would make the resident unable to answer, perhaps allowing himself to find a loophole, but the resident immediately replied: American planes often come here, so I know. So Kenny was disappointed again and went to find another resident. This time it was not Kenny who asked the questions, but Mulray, who had been silent for a long time. He pretended to be very "kind" to the residents, squatted down and talked to them. But when he had only asked a few questions, and the resident's answer mentioned the word "bombing", Mulray stood up and was unwilling to ask any further. The two US colonels turned and walked towards a farmer's house. The owner of the house pointed out the broken window to them that had been damaged by shrapnel, and he took out the shrapnel and said: I was almost knocked down by this shrapnel. The hostess of the house also testified to the fact of the plane bombing. The two US colonels ran around in the sun, hitting walls everywhere, and were no longer interested in conducting this disappointing investigation. All the material evidence and eyewitness testimony conclusively proved the following conclusion: At 0:30 on September 1st, planes of the United Nations forces dropped two explosive fragmentation bombs near General Nam Il's residence.

    一切人证物证确凿证明美机轰炸中立区
    美方联络官在进行调查时狼狈不堪
        【新华社四日讯】本社特派记者四日自开城报道美方联络官在调查九月一日轰炸事件时的狼狈相说：九月一日十时四十分，我方和美方联络官到达被炸地点现场进行共同调查。美方负责调查的两位官员是肯尼上校和穆莱上校。这两位上校对人们已不是生疏的人。在八月二十二日的轰炸事件发生后，他们两人也曾应我方联络官的促请，前来现场调查。在那次调查中他们几乎是被人推一步走一步。刚走到第一个炸弹坑肯尼就不耐烦地说：“这不值得一看”。这一次可大不相同了，第一个弹坑还没有调查完毕，美方联络官就催着要去看第二个弹坑，而且是急急忙忙要去找人证调查。我方联络官告诉这两位上校说：除了向当地居民调查外，在附近山头上还有军事警察可以叫来调查。他们摇摇头，只找当地的居民调查。从第二个弹坑地点经过第一个弹坑走向村里去的路上，有两个居民正在稻田里收拾残存的稻穗，中国记者以为联络官们会停下来调查的，但这两位美国上校却从他们身边迳直走过去了，他们要去找自己认可的居民调查。
    在这次居民调查中，美方联络官亲自找了三个居民，并访问了一个农家。肯尼向找到的第一个居民问他听到飞机声音没有？看到飞机没有？怎样知道是飞机轰炸的？这个居民回答说：他在睡觉的时候听到了两声爆炸的声音，接着又听到了飞机在他头上打圈子时发出的嗡嗡声。这个居民的回答证明了九月一日零时三十分在大庙洞附近出现的弹坑，正是从飞机上投下的炸弹炸成的。肯尼不愿意听这些话，就忙着去找第二个居民调查。在访问第二个居民时，肯尼的朝鲜语翻译官特意装出一副笑脸，还从口袋里掏出纸烟请那位居民吸，却被那位居民拒绝了。肯尼用同样的问题问这个居民，他说：他听到飞机扔下的炸弹爆炸两声以后，飞机就向南逃走了。他认为这是美国的飞机，他还说：炸弹片打到他的院子里打坏了他的窗子。在一旁的肯尼沉不住气了，他没等到居民说完就问道：你怎么知道向南飞去的飞机是美国的？肯尼原以为这样一来就会使那位居民不知所答，也许可以让自己钻下空子，但是那位居民立即回答道：美国飞机经常到这里来，所以我知道。于是肯尼再度失望了，又去找另一个居民，这一次不是肯尼来发问，而是那位沉默了好久的穆莱来发问。他装得对居民很“可亲”的样子，蹲下来和居民谈话。但是当他才问了几句话，而那位居民的答话中一提到“轰炸”两个字眼的时候，穆莱就站了起来，再不愿意问下去了。这两位美国上校就转身向一个农家走去。这一家的主人把被炸弹碎片打坏的窗子指给他们看，他并且拿出碎片来说：我几乎被这弹片打倒。这一家的主妇也证明了飞机轰炸的事实。这两位美国上校在太阳底下跑来跑去到处碰壁，再也没兴趣进行这个扫兴的调查了。一切的物证和人证都确确凿凿地证明了下面的一个结论：九月一日零时三十分联合国军的飞机在南日将军住所附近投掷了两枚爆炸杀伤弹。
