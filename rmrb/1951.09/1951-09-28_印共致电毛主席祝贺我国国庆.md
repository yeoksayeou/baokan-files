    Dear Comrade:

    October 1, 1951, is the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a day of joyous celebration not only for China but for all countries, especially Asian countries.

    The tremendous progress achieved by the Chinese people under your brilliant leadership encourages all Asian people to redouble their efforts to win national freedom and establish full democracy. The Indian people express their gratitude to your government for the fraternal assistance it has given them in their struggle against disaster and famine. The heroic role played by the Chinese People's Volunteers in defending peace and freedom in the Far East and thwarting the plans of the imperialist warmongers deeply moves the Indian people.

    Today, people's China, under your leadership, has stood up as the leader of the re-emerging Asian people.

    On this great festival, the Communist Party of India extends its warm respect to the Chinese people and to you.

    With fraternal greetings,

    Ajoy Ghosh
