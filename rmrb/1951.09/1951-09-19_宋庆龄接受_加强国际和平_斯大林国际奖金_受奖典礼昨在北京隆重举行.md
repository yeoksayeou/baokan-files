Therefore, she has been unanimously elected by the award committee. This is the glory of Ms. Soong Ching Ling personally, and also the glory of all the Chinese people. Guo Moruo finally pointed out: At present, the world peace camp is engaged in a sharp struggle with the aggressive camp headed by US imperialism. The Chinese people warmly congratulate Ms. Soong Ching Ling on receiving this highest honor, and we must more courageously shoulder the cause of safeguarding peace, and fight together with the great Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world to defend the cause of world peace to the end.

Fedelin, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, read the award decision of the "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations" Stalin International Prize Committee.

Peng Zhen, Vice-Chairman of the China Peace Committee, delivered a speech. He said: Ms. Soong Ching Ling is an outstanding representative of the peace-loving and democratic Chinese people. Now, the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace is at a critical juncture. The camp of peaceful countries has become unprecedentedly strong. However, US imperialism and its lackeys, in order to step up open preparations for a new world war, have begun to restore Japanese militarism, hastily and unreasonably signed the US-made Japanese Peace Treaty, and shamelessly openly sabotaged the Korean armistice negotiations, insisting on its aggression against Korea and our country. However, this death throes of the imperialists cannot save them from failure. At present, the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea is continuing to deepen and develop. We firmly believe that we will surely be able to bring the Korean War to a victorious end. The forces of the world defending peace are also rapidly continuing to grow stronger. Peace will surely defeat war.

The ceremony ended here. Afterwards, a celebration party was held. (Attached picture)
