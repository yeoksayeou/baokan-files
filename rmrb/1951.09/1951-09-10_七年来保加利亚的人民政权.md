	Seven Years of the People's Regime in Bulgaria
	Ambassador of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to China, Petkov

	This year, on September 9th, the Bulgarian people will celebrate the seventh great National Day – Liberation Day.

	Seven years ago – on September 9, 1944, the Bulgarian people launched a nationwide armed uprising, overthrew the fascist rule in the country, and established their own people's regime – the Fatherland Front government. Thus, the long and arduous struggle of the working people of our country, led by the working class under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, against fascism and reactionary forces, with extraordinary fortitude and heroism, achieved complete victory. The victorious advance of the glorious Soviet army into the Balkans was of decisive significance for the victory of this struggle. The Soviet army pursued the defeated German fascist troops, entered Bulgaria as liberators, and thereby supported and encouraged the anti-fascist uprising of the Bulgarian people. The people's uprising of September 9th and the establishment of the Fatherland Front government were a turning point in the history of our people, because it opened the way for our country to establish a new social system – the road to socialism. This great event in our country's history is primarily the result of the Soviet Union's consistent anti-imperialist policy, the victory of its brave army – the liberator, and the brilliant leadership of the leader of the Soviet people – the great Stalin. That is why September 9th, as our Liberation Day, is also a day of sincere gratitude of our people to their liberators, and a festival of eternal friendship and cooperation with the fraternal nations of the great country of communism.

	Comrade Dimitrov declared at the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party: "Referring to the victory of the September 9th People's Uprising, it must be emphasized once again: the greatest merit for the victory of the September 9th Uprising and for liberating our motherland from the oppression of German fascism belongs to the fraternal and heroic Soviet army and its brilliant leader – Marshal Stalin. Therefore, the Party, the working class, and all the working people of our country harbor eternal gratitude to them."

	In the past seven years of peaceful creative labor and courageous struggle for national independence, democracy, and socialism, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, have achieved great achievements in the cause of building a new people's democratic Bulgaria. In these struggles, the working class and its allies – the working peasants – have been and are the driving force. Our Party and people have waged arduous and unyielding struggles to consolidate the people's democratic regime, to eliminate the stubborn resistance of domestic reactionaries, and to smash the conspiracy of Anglo-American imperialists to turn our country into their colony.

	A series of democratic reforms have been implemented. Women have gained equal rights with men. All discrimination against ethnic minorities has been eliminated. Land reform has also been implemented. Most of the land confiscated from landlords was given to the desperately poor or poor peasants. The law on confiscating illegally obtained property has been passed. According to this law, the people recovered everything that had been plundered by merchants and capitalists and exploited from the labor of the working class and peasants.

	In 1946, the Bulgarian people overthrew the monarchy by means of a national referendum and established the People's Republic.

	The Bulgarian Communist Party successfully conducted the struggle against domestic reactionaries, who began to gather around the Anglo-American imperialist spy Gemeto, and later around Nikola, Petkov, and Rulchev, and embarked on the path of assassins and saboteurs, preparing to overthrow the people's regime in Bulgaria by force with the aid of foreign powers.

	In December 1947, the National Assembly passed the Dimitrov Constitution. The Dimitrov Constitution enshrined the great achievements of our people in legal terms and laid the foundation for our people's democratic system. In the same month, in accordance with the Dimitrov Constitution, private enterprises and banks were nationalized, state monopoly of foreign trade and domestic wholesale trade was implemented, and the state purchased all privately owned large agricultural implements. After the implementation of these measures, our country bravely marched towards the road of socialism.

	At the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party at the end of 1948, Dimitrov pointed out in his report the main tasks of the Party, the government, and the people in the cause of establishing the socialist economic and cultural foundations in our country. The Congress discussed and adopted the National Economic Five-Year Plan. The realization of the Five-Year Plan has become the central task of our people.

	Following the instructions of our late leader and mentor – Comrade Georgi Dimitrov, under the leadership of the Party and with the selfless help of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the Bulgarian people have achieved great successes in all sectors of economic and cultural construction.

	The achievements of our country's socialist industrialization can be clearly seen in the construction of new enterprises that have been launched on a large scale. In 1950 alone, ten large factories and seven power stations were completed and have already started work. These factories are of particularly great significance to our national economy. Before the end of this year, another four power stations and the greatest object of our economic construction – the Stalin Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory – will be completed and start work.

	Our country's industrial products are growing rapidly, and last year's total industrial output exceeded three times that of 1939. The industry manufacturing the means of production is developing rapidly. Compared with 1939, last year's electricity production almost doubled, coal production increased more than doubled, the mining industry increased fifteen times, metal production increased more than twenty-eight times, and the production of machine tool factories increased fifty times.

	Our achievements in industry are the result of the creative enthusiasm and labor achievements of our working class. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our working class has generated a new attitude towards labor and social property, and has learned from Soviet workers to master advanced Stakhanovite work methods.

	Many major achievements have also been made in the socialist transformation of agricultural production. Working peasants voluntarily participate in labor cooperative farms, and the government has established many machine tractor stations and state-owned farms. With agricultural cooperative movements and mechanization methods, conditions have been created for the transformation from small-scale backward individual economies to large-scale cooperative mechanized economies with high production efficiency. The technological foundation of agricultural production is gradually expanding, and the number of tractor stations has reached one hundred and fifteen this year, while in 1945 there were only five. In the last two years, the number of labor cooperative farms has greatly increased, and today 2,709 labor cooperative farms have been established, accounting for 48 percent of the country's cultivated land.

	The material and cultural well-being of our people is constantly improving. The production of daily necessities is also constantly increasing. These achievements reached by our people in the past seven years would not have been possible without the selfless help of the Soviet Union and the close economic cooperation of the people's democratic countries.

	Under the leadership of our leader and mentor – Comrade Georgi Dimitrov's loyal student and successor, Comrade Chervenkov, our people stand firmly and confidently in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The foreign policy instructed by Comrade Dimitrov and resolutely implemented by our government is a peaceful policy of friendly cooperation with all peace-loving and democratic countries. The basic idea of our foreign policy is the consistent friendship with the Soviet Union and the loyalty and dedication to our great mentor and leader – Stalin. Our country has gained such a new and powerful friend as the People's Republic of China. The friendly cooperation and mutual assistance relations between our two peoples are being consolidated and strengthened. The Bulgarian people are watching with great interest and excitement the great achievements of the Chinese people who are bravely moving towards economic and cultural progress under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Mao Zedong.

	This year, the Bulgarian people are welcoming the seventh anniversary of the September Uprising under tense international situation. The Anglo-American imperialist bloc is frantically embarking on the road of arms race. In order to prepare for war, the US imperialists have turned to direct acts of aggression against freedom-loving people, that is, the bloody intervention in Korea and the open occupation of Taiwan. The unprecedented atrocities of Anglo-American aggressors and executioners in Korea, in terms of their cruelty, are unheard of in history. But the heroic Korean people, with the help of the glorious and heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, have given a decisive blow to the Anglo-American aggressors. In the face of this danger, all the freedom-loving people of the world have gathered all their forces to save peace, prevent war, and stop the barbaric imperialism. The great army of peace is growing day by day, and it is an invincible force. The aggression plans of the American aggressors will be shattered. The Bulgarian people are an integral part of the great army of peace. Nearly six million Bulgarian citizens have signed the World Peace Council's declaration on concluding a peace treaty among the five major powers.

	Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Dimitrov's Central Committee headed by Comrade Chervenkov, the Bulgarian people are building their happy socialist future with full confidence.

    七年来保加利亚的人民政权
    保加利亚人民共和国驻华大使  彼得科夫
    今年九月九日，保加利亚人民将庆祝第七届伟大的国庆节——自由日。
    七年以前——一九四四年九月九日，保加利亚人民发动了全民的武装起义，在国内推翻了法西斯的统治，建立了人民自己的政权——祖国阵线政府。这样，我国以工人阶级为首的劳动人民，在保加利亚共产党领导之下，以异乎寻常的刚强与英雄气概所进行的反对法西斯和反动力量的长期和艰苦的斗争就完全的胜利了。光荣的苏军向巴尔干的胜利进军，对于这一斗争的胜利是具有决定性的意义的。苏军追击溃退的德国法西斯军队，以解放者的资格进入了保加利亚，并以此支援与鼓舞了保加利亚人民的反法西斯起义。九月九日的人民起义以及祖国阵线政府的建立，是我国人民历史的转捩点，因为从此开辟了我国建立新社会制度的道路——走向社会主义的道路。这一我国历史上的伟大事件，首先是苏联的一贯反帝国主义政策与她的勇敢的军队——解放者的胜利及苏联各族人民领袖——伟大的斯大林的天才领导的结果。这就是为什么作为我们的解放日的九月九日，同时又是我国人民对自己的解放者热诚感激的日子，是与伟大的建设共产主义的国家的兄弟民族的永恒的友爱与合作的节日。
    季米特洛夫同志在保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会上宣称：“提到九月九日人民起义的胜利，必须再一次强调：九月九日起义的胜利与将我们的祖国自德国法西斯的压迫下解放出来的最大功勋，是属于兄弟般的和英勇的苏军和它的天才的领袖——斯大林大元帅的。因此，党、工人阶级与我国全体劳动人民对于他们怀着永恒的感激之情。”
    在和平的创造性的劳动与争取民族独立、民主与社会主义的勇敢斗争的过去七年中，保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导之下，在建立新的人民民主的保加利亚的事业中，获得了巨大的成就。在这些斗争中，工人阶级及其同盟者——劳动农民过去及现在都是推动力。我们的党与人民为巩固人民民主政权，为肃清国内反动派的顽抗，为粉碎英美帝国主义者想变我国为其殖民地的阴谋而进行了艰苦与不屈的斗争。
    一系列的民主改革都实现了。妇女获得与男子平等的权利。一切对少数民族的歧视已肃清了。土地改革也已实现。自地主手中没收来的土地的大部分给了赤贫或贫苦的农民。没收非法获得之财产的法令已通过了。根据这一法令，人民收回了曾被商人与资本家所掠夺和剥削工人阶级与农民劳动的一切东西。
    一九四六年，保加利亚人民以国民投票的方法推翻了君主，成立了人民共和国。
    保加利亚共产党成功地进行了反对国内反动派的斗争，这些反动派开始纠集在英美帝国主义间谍格米多周围，后来纠集在尼古拉、彼特科夫及鲁尔切夫的周围，并且走上暗害者和怠工者的道路，准备借外力以暴力推翻保加利亚的人民政权。
    一九四七年十二月，国民议会通过了季米特洛夫宪法。季米特洛夫宪法将我们人民巨大的成就用法律的条文固定下来，并奠定了我国的人民民主制度。在同一月中，根据季米特洛夫宪法实行了私有企业及银行的国有化，开始实行国外贸易和国内批发贸易的国家独占，国家征买了全部私有的大件农具，在实行这些措施之后，我国就勇敢地向着社会主义的道路上迈进了。
    在一九四八年底的第五次保加利亚共产党代表大会上，季米特洛夫在自己的报告中指出了党、政府与人民在我国建立社会主义经济及文化基础的事业中的主要任务。大会讨论并通过了国民经济五年计划。实现五年计划就成为我国人民的中心任务了。
    保加利亚人民遵循着已故的领袖与导师——乔治·季米特洛夫同志的指示，在党的领导之下与苏联及人民民主国家无私的帮助之下，在经济文化建设的各部门都已获得了巨大的成就。
    在已经大规模展开的新企业的建设中，可以明显地看出我国社会主义工业化的成就。仅在一九五○年里就有十个大工厂和七个发电站完工并已开始工作。这些工厂对于我国国民经济是具有特殊巨大的意义的。在今年年底以前，又将有四个发电站和我国经济建设的最伟大的对象——斯大林氮肥料制造厂完工并开始工作。
    我国工业产品加速地增长着，去年工业的总产量比一九三九年超过了三倍。制造生产资料的工业飞速地发展着。与一九三九年比较起来，去年的电力生产几乎增加了两倍，煤的生产提高到两倍多，采矿业提高到十五倍，金属生产提高到二十八倍多，母机制造厂的生产则提高到五十倍。
    我们的工业方面的成就，是我们工人阶级的创造性的热情与劳动业绩的成果。我们的工人阶级在共产党的领导下产生了新的对于劳动和社会财产的态度，并且向苏联工人学习掌握了先进的斯达哈诺夫的工作方法。
    在农业生产的社会主义改造方面也获得了许多的重大成就。劳动农民们自愿地参加劳动合作农庄，政府建立了许多机器拖拉机站与国营农场。以农业合作运动和机械化方法，为由小规模的落后的个体经济转变为大规模的合作的机械化的有高度生产效率的经济建立了条件。农业生产的技术基础在逐渐扩展着，拖拉机站的数目今年达到一百一十五个，而在一九四五年只有五个。在最近两年来，劳动合作农庄的数目大大地增加了，今天已建立起二千七百零九个劳动合作农庄，占全国耕地的百分之四十八。
    我国人民的物质与文化福利正在不断地提高。日用品的生产也正在不断地增加。我国人民七年来达到的这些成就，如果没有苏联大公无私的帮助与人民民主国家的密切的经济合作是不可能的。
    在我们的领袖与导师——乔治·季米特洛夫的忠实学生和继承者契尔文科夫同志的领导之下，我国人民坚定地满怀信心地站立在和平、民主与社会主义的阵营中。季米特洛夫同志所指示的并坚决为我们政府所执行的外交政策是与所有爱好和平与民主的国家友善合作的和平政策。我们的外交政策的基本思想是与苏联的始终不渝的友谊和对我们伟大的导师和领袖——斯大林的忠诚与献身。我国获得了中华人民共和国这样一个新的强有力的朋友。我们两国人民间的友谊合作与互助的关系正在巩固和加强着。保加利亚人民怀着很大的兴趣与兴奋的心情注视着在光荣的中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东领导之下勇敢地走向经济与文化的进步的中国人民的巨大成就。
    今年保加利亚人民在紧张的国际局势下迎接九月起义的七周年。英美帝国主义集团正疯狂地走着军备竞赛的道路。为了准备战争，美帝国主义者转入了对爱好自由的人民的直接侵略行动，这就是对朝鲜的血腥干涉与对台湾的公开侵占。英美侵略者和刽子手在朝鲜的空前兽行，以其残酷的程度而言，是有史以来所未闻的。但是英勇的朝鲜人民在光荣而英勇的中国人民志愿军的帮助下已给予英美侵略者以决定性的打击。在这种危险面前，全世界爱好自由的人民为了挽救和平、防止战争和制止野蛮的帝国主义而聚集了所有的力量。伟大的和平大军一天一天地增长着，它是不可战胜的力量。美国侵略者的侵略计划必被粉碎。保加利亚人民是和平大军中不可分的一部分。将近六百万的保加利亚公民已在世界和平理事会关于缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名。
    在保加利亚共产党和以契尔文科夫同志为首的季米特洛夫的党中央领导之下，保加利亚人民满怀信心地建设着自己幸福的社会主义的将来。
