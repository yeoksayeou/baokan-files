    Oppose Using High-Quality Materials for Trivial Purposes and Using Long Materials for Short Purposes
    According to a letter from Comrade Li Sen of the Tianjin Railway Bureau Lumber Mill: Some material-using units do not pay enough attention to saving wood when processing logs at the factory. In the past six months, among the logs entrusted to the factory by the Tianjin Railway Bureau Materials Department for processing, approximately more than 10,000 cubic meters were eight meters long. However, the required finished product sizes that are eight meters long are very few; most of them have to be cut from the eight-meter-long wood into five-meter, four-meter, and three-meter lengths for use. Sometimes, because the user unit's plan and the supply of raw materials are inconsistent, a large section of the eight-meter-long wood has to be cut off, leaving a one-meter to two-meter long log end. This is a significant waste. According to the Tianjin wood price statistics for July, the price of red pine logs four meters long is 1.2 million yuan per cubic meter, while the price of logs eight meters long is 1.6 million yuan per cubic meter. Based on the more than 10,000 cubic meters that have been processed, this results in a loss of about 4 billion yuan. Furthermore, some material-using units, in order to complete their tasks quickly, do not further process the thick bark that is sawn off into other products, but instead pile it up and sell it off. This is also a loss. This wasteful phenomenon of using long materials for short purposes and using high-quality materials for trivial purposes should be avoided as much as possible or overcome by finding ways. The way to overcome it is that, first of all, the person in charge of the material-using department must understand the importance of saving wood ideologically and ensure that the lumber mill is supplied with logs of appropriate size according to the material usage plan. On the lumber mill's side, attention should also be paid to consulting with the material-using department and using the remaining small pieces of wood to saw by-products, without being afraid that this will affect working hours. From the perspective of saving wood, it is worthwhile to increase working hours slightly. In any case, in this regard, the regulations in the State Council's instructions on saving wood should be conscientiously implemented: "The use of wood should be based on the principle of thrift, striving for economic rationality: it is forbidden to use high-quality materials for trivial purposes, to use long materials for short purposes, and to use superior materials for inferior purposes."

### 反对大材小用、长材短用

    反对大材小用、长材短用
    据天津铁路局制材厂李森同志来信说：有些用材单位在该厂加工原木时，在节约木材方面注意得非常不够。最近半年中，由天津铁路局材料处委托该厂加工的原木中，八公尺长的大约有一万多立方公尺。可是要求的成品的尺寸，八公尺长的却少得很；大多数却是得把八公尺长的木料截成五公尺、四公尺、三公尺来用。有时因为用料单位的计划和原料的供应不一致，竟要把八公尺长的木料截用一大段，剩下一公尺到两公尺长的原木头。这是很大的一笔浪费。根据七月份天津市木材牌价统计，四公尺长的红松原木每立方公尺价一百二十万元，而八公尺长的每立方公尺却要一百六十万元。按已加工的一万多立方公尺计算，这样就损失了四十亿元左右。还有的用料单位只求快些完成任务，把锯下来的很厚的板皮不再加工锯制其他产品，而堆起来标卖出去。这也是一种损失。这种长材短用、大材小用的浪费现象，是应该极力避免或想办法克服的。克服的办法，首先是用材部门的负责人要从思想上认识节约木材的重要，切实按照用料计划以尺寸适当的原木供应制材厂。在制材厂方面，也应注意与用材部门商议，用剩余的小块木料锯制副产品，不要怕因此影响工时。从节省木材方面着想，稍增加一些工时也是值得的。不论如何，在这方面应切实执行政务院关于节约木材的指示中的规定：“使用木材应本节约原则，力求经济合理：禁止大材小用、长材短用、优材劣用。”
