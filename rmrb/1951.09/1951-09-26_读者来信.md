Reader's Letters

    Promote the History of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan
    Oppose the US's Crime of a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan (I)
    To the Editor:
    The article "The US-British Orchestration of the Peace Treaty with Japan is Completely Illegal" by Comrade Gao Ji, published in the People's Daily on September 7th and 8th, is a very good article.
    This article has a clear viewpoint and explains the reasoning thoroughly. In particular, the very rich materials and many important figures are very convincing. It has made me more concretely and systematically aware of the Japanese imperialists' aggression against our country in recent decades; the enormous sacrifices and great contributions of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan; especially the great contributions of the Chinese People's Armed Forces and the people of the liberated areas led by the Communist Party of China in the War of Resistance Against Japan; it has also made me more concretely and correctly understand the great assistance that the Soviet Union gave our country during our separate war against Japan; the Soviet Union's important contribution to the war against Japan. At the same time, it also exposed the fact that before the outbreak of the Pacific War, US and British imperialism, in order to "actively oppose the Soviet Union with Japan" and "to jointly control China with Japan and share the privileges of the Pacific," spared no effort to provide Japan with a large amount of financial and war materials; even after the US and Britain were forced to fight Japan, they were "ineffective in combat and opportunistic"; and finally used the atomic bomb as "a means of blackmail to seize the fruits of victory in the war against Japan and strengthen the US's aggressive position in Asia after the war."
    I believe that in order to combat the US's bloody conspiracy and plan to create a separate peace treaty and step up the armament of Japan, our primary task at present is to conduct extensive publicity and education to the broad masses of the people, so that everyone can more concretely recognize the conspiracy of US imperialism, and make US imperialism more isolated. And this article is one of the good materials for us to do publicity and education. Some of the information is what every Chinese person should know today. I hope everyone will try to introduce more people to read this article, and specifically publicize the rich content of this article to the people around them, especially those who do not have the ability to read newspapers.

    (II) To the Editor:
    Recently, US imperialism and its servant states signed a separate peace treaty with Japan in San Francisco. The United States completely disregarded the legitimate right of the Chinese people to draft and sign a peace treaty with Japan, which is not permissible. At the San Francisco conference, the Soviet Union suggested inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate, but this reasonable proposal was unreasonably rejected by the conference manipulated by US imperialism.
    Now the crazy actions of US imperialism are being exposed one by one. These actions directly threaten the security of our motherland. We should mobilize, vigorously publicize the anti-Japanese achievements of our people since "September 18th," expose the crimes of US imperialism in making a separate peace with Japan, and call on everyone to work hard to produce, enthusiastically donate airplanes and cannons, and consolidate our national defense and defend our motherland with practical actions.

    Criticism Should Not Be One-Sided and Exaggerated
    Zhou Zibo's Manuscript "It is Necessary to Correctly Represent the People's Volunteers" Has Problems
    To the Editor:
    The short article "It is Necessary to Correctly Represent the People's Volunteers" published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on September 18th, I think that the author Zhou Zibo's criticism of those two sets of comic strips is not completely correct.
    In the first paragraph of his article, Zhou Zibo mainly criticizes "Fearless Warriors." He said that the painter of "Fearless Warriors" "distorted the depiction of these respectable and lovely characters, which is very inappropriate." This criticism is inaccurate. In fact, this set of sixteen comic strips, of which fourteen forcefully demonstrate the patriotic and great actions of the volunteer Li Chaoxing in bravely killing the enemy, and the deep friendship of internationalism in loving the Korean people.
    The more serious bias in Zhou Zibo's critical article is expressed in the criticism of "Female Nurse Saves Wounded Soldiers in Fire." Zhou Zibo believes that the author of "Female Nurse Saves Wounded Soldiers in Fire" "only grasped some superficial phenomena for narration, and did not express the essence of the hero from the thoughts and feelings of the character, which made the ideological nature of the work extremely poor." Zhou Zibo's criticism is very inappropriate, or it can be said to be wrong. The thoughts and feelings of a character are an invisible thing, which can only be discovered through actual behavior. In all twenty paintings of "Female Nurse Saves Wounded Soldiers in Fire," almost every painting expresses the thoughts and feelings of a heroic figure like Wang Ying. Isn't Wang Ying's heroic behavior of actively working in the artillery fire, regardless of her own sacrifice, a manifestation of her being dominated by her strong thoughts and feelings? Wang Ying saved the wounded soldier back, fed the wounded soldier the meal, she was extremely hungry, but she was not willing to eat at all, and gave her share to the wounded soldier who was not full, is this not a manifestation of a noble class friendship?
    Finally, I believe that it is very important to vigorously carry out criticism of books and publications at present. It has played a great role in improving the political and ideological nature of publications in New China, and it is also of great help to improving the political and ideological level of the broad masses of readers. However, in order to better carry out this strict ideological work, I think we should pay close attention to two issues at present:
    1. In our criticism work, we must prevent the style of criticism for the sake of criticism. We must also overcome the one-sided and exaggerated thinking in criticism work.
    2. Editors should adopt a cautious and responsible attitude. They should not only be satisfied with the general principles in the critic's article, but should practically compare the general principles with the actual content being criticized. This is the only way to prevent criticism work from becoming vulgar and chaotic.
                                    Zhang Wu, Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Editor's Note: The opinions put forward by Comrade Zhang Wu in this letter are correct; the criticism put forward by Comrade Zhou Zibo in the article "It is Necessary to Correctly Represent the People's Volunteers" is biased. The editor's publication of Comrade Zhou Zibo's letter without criticism is also incorrect.

    Gao Fenglin, Director of the Women's Federation of Shuangta Village, Changping, Actually Helped Men Oppress Women
    To the Editor:
    Gao Fenglin, the director of the Women's Federation of Shuangta Village, Er District, Changping County, Hebei Province, actually helped villager Liu Kun oppress women. Wang Shuying (also known as Wang Zhuzi), a woman from Dongxia Village in the district, married Liu Kun six years ago. Liu Kun had served as a puppet soldier before liberation. After he got married, he often beat and scolded Wang Shuying, and sometimes didn't even let her eat. After liberation, Liu Kun returned home and continued to abuse Wang Shuying. In August of this year, Liu Kun beat Wang Shuying indiscriminately with a rubber wheel belt. Liu Kun's sister-in-law, Gao Fenglin, helped Liu Kun beat Wang Shuying at the time.
    Wang Shuying couldn't stand the abuse and went to the village chief Yan He to file for divorce from Liu Kun. Yan He said, "There is nothing good about those who file for divorce first. If you make trouble again, I will arrest you!" Wang Shuying wanted to go to the district government to get a divorce, but Fan Zhichao, the civil affairs commissioner of the village, not only refused to issue a letter of introduction, but also threatened, "You can't sue anyone there without my letter." Later, the district government learned about this and wrote three letters in a row asking Fan Zhichao to come to the district, but he never went.
    It is hoped that the local government will quickly resolve Wang Shuying's problem and punish Liu Kun and Gao Fenglin according to law.

    宣传中国人民抗日战争历史
    反对美国单独对日媾和罪行（一）编辑同志：
    九月七、八两日，人民日报发表的高集同志的“美英包办对日和约是完全非法的”一文，是一篇非常好的文章。
    这篇文章，观点明确，道理说得透彻明白，特别是那些非常丰富的材料及许多很重要的数目字，具有非常大的说服力。它使我更具体地、更有系统地认清了日本帝国主义近几十年来对我国的侵略；我国人民在对日战争中的巨大牺牲与伟大贡献；特别是由中国共产党所领导的中国人民武装部队和解放区人民在对日战争中的伟大贡献；也使我更具体、更正确地了解苏联在我国单独对日作战时期给我国以多么大的援助；苏联在对日战争中的重要贡献。同时，它也揭露了美英帝国主义在太平洋战争爆发前，为了要使“日本积极反苏”，为了“与日本共同控制中国，分享太平洋的特权”，而不惜在财政上及作战物资上大量援助日本；即使美英在被迫对日作战后，也是“作战不力，投机取巧”；最后更以原子弹“作一种讹诈手段，来夺取对日战争的胜利果实，加强美国战后在亚洲的侵略地位。”……
    我认为，为了打击美国制造单独和约、加紧武装日本的血腥阴谋与计划，我们目前首要的任务是向广大人民进行广泛宣传与教育，使大家更具体认识美帝国主义阴谋，使美帝国主义益加孤立。而这篇文章正是我们作宣传与教育的好材料之一。其中的一些资料都是今天每一个中国人民所应当知道的。我希望大家尽量介绍更多的人来读这篇文章，要把这篇文章的丰富内容，向周围的人，特别是没有读报能力的人作具体宣传。
        梨稻葵
    （二）编辑同志：
    最近美帝国主义及其仆从国家在旧金山签订了单独对日和约。美国完全抹煞了中国人民拟制和签订对日和约的正当权利，这是不能容许的。苏联在旧金山会议上，建议邀请我中华人民共和国代表参加，可是这个合理的建议竟被美帝国主义操纵的大会无理否决了。
    现在美帝国主义疯狂的行为，正在一件一件地暴露出来。这些行动直接威胁到我们祖国的安全。我们应该动员起来，大力宣传我国人民自“九一八”以来的抗日功绩，揭穿美帝国主义单独对日媾和的罪恶，号召大家努力生产，热烈捐献飞机大炮，以实际行动来巩固我们的国防，保卫我们的祖国。

    批评不能片面和夸大
    周子博所写“要正确表现
    人民志愿军”一稿有毛病编辑同志：
    九月十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了“要正确表现人民志愿军”的一篇短文，我认为该文作者周子博对那两套连环图画的批评是不完全正确的。
    周子博在他的文章的第一段里，主要是对“无畏的勇士”的批评。他说：“无畏的勇士”的画作者“对这些可敬可爱的人物作了歪曲的描写，这是很不应该的”。这种批评是不确切的。实际上，这套十六幅的连环画，其中十四幅是有力地表现了志愿军李朝兴英勇杀敌的爱国主义伟大行动，热爱朝鲜人民的国际主义的深厚友谊。
    周子博的批评文章中，比较严重的偏向是表现在批评“女护士火中救伤员”中。周子博认为“女护士火中救伤员”的作者，对于女护士的英勇行为，“只抓取了一些表面现象加以陈述，而不从人物的思想、感情去表现英雄的本质，这使得作品的思想性极贫乏。”周子博这样的批评是很不妥当的，或者可说是错误的。人物的思想感情是一种无形的东西，只有通过实际行为才能被人发现。“女护士火中救伤员”全部二十幅画中，几乎每一幅都表现了王颖这样一个英雄人物的思想和感情。王颖不顾自己牺牲在炮火中积极工作的英勇行为，不正是表现她被自己的强烈的思想感情所支配吗？王颖把伤员救回来，喂完了伤员的饭，她自己饿极了，但她却一点也不肯吃，而把自己的一份又给了没吃饱的伤员，这不是一种崇高的阶级友爱的思想感情表现吗？
    最后，我认为目前大力开展书刊、出版物的批评工作，是非常重要的，对于提高新中国出版物的政治思想性是起了很大作用的，对提高广大读者的政治思想水平，也是有很大帮助的。但是，为了更好地进行这种严密的思想工作，我觉得目前应切实注意两个问题：
    一、在我们的批评工作中，必须防止为批评而批评的作风。也要克服批评工作中的片面和夸大的思想。
    二、编辑工作者更应采取慎重负责的态度。不能只满足于批评者文章中的一般道理，应把一般道理切实对照被批评的实际内容。这样才能防止把批评工作弄得庸俗与混乱。
                                    中共北京市委宣传部  张  武
    编者按：张武同志在这封信中提出的意见是正确的；周子博同志在“要正确表现人民志愿军”一文中提出的批评，是有偏差的。编者无批判地发表了周子博同志的来信，也是不正确的。
    昌平双塔村妇女主任高凤林
    竟帮助男子欺压妇女编辑同志：
    河北省昌平县二区双塔村妇女主任高凤林，竟帮助村民刘坤欺压妇女。该区东匣村妇女王淑英（又名王珠子），于六年前嫁给刘坤。刘坤解放前曾当过伪军。他结婚之后，经常打骂王淑英，有时还不让她吃饭。解放后，刘坤回家，依然虐待王淑英。今年八月间，刘坤曾用胶皮轮带，将王淑英乱打一顿。刘坤的嫂子高凤林，当时竟帮助刘坤打王淑英。
    王淑英受气不过，找村长阎和，提出和刘坤离婚。阎和说：“先提离婚的没好东西，你再闹就把你押起来！”王淑英要到区政府去离婚，该村民政委员范志超不但不开介绍信，还威吓说：“没有我的信你到那里也不能告人。”后来区政府知道了这件事，连着写了三次信要范志超到区，他一直也没去。
    希望当地政府赶快解决王淑英的问题，并依法处分刘坤和高凤林。
