Explanation of the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China"
Xu Deheng, Acting Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government

Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and Members:

On behalf of the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government, I am making a report explaining the Provisional Organization Regulations of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China.

The formulation of these regulations is very necessary for our judicial work at present.

With the development and deepening of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and land reform, the work of the People's Courts is becoming increasingly heavy. The number of general criminal and civil cases received by the People's Courts at all levels in various localities is very large. Taking the Northeast Administrative Region as an example: in the first half of 1951, the People's Courts at all levels in the region accepted a total of 88,246 criminal and civil cases; including 51,058 criminal cases and 37,188 civil cases. Taking the seven major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing as another example: in the first half of 1951, the People's Courts in the above-mentioned cities accepted a total of 95,983 criminal and civil cases; including 34,883 criminal cases and 61,100 civil cases. Taking the three provinces of Shanxi, Chahar, and Shandong, and the two administrative offices of Northern Anhui and Southern Jiangsu as another example: in the first half of 1951, the People's Courts in the above-mentioned regions accepted a total of 170,703 criminal and civil cases; including 102,641 criminal cases and 68,062 civil cases. In order to improve the organization of the People's Courts at all levels and various work systems, and to strengthen the people's judicial work, it is also very necessary to promulgate a unified organizational regulation for the People's Courts at present.

This regulation has undergone a long period of research and drafting. In the winter of 1948, the Legal Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China started drafting based on the long-term experience of the people's judicial work in the old liberated areas. Since the spring of 1950, the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government has continued to study and revise it, continuously summarizing the work experience of the People's Courts in North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, East China, and Central South China, studying a large number of practical materials on adjudication work, and referring to the court organization laws of the Soviet Union and other relevant materials. Only then was the first draft completed. Afterwards, it was initially discussed at the First National Judicial Conference last year, and opinions were solicited from the relevant departments of the Central People's Government and the responsible comrades of the local judicial organs. It has been repeatedly revised many times and has been submitted to the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council and the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for review and amendment before it became the current regulation. Now it is submitted to the Central People's Government Committee for review and final approval.

Since our country's various constructions are still in the initial stage, and the People's Liberation War has not yet finally ended, it is difficult to make overly detailed and rigid regulations regarding the organization of the People's Courts and various judicial systems. Therefore, this regulation is only a general provisional organizational regulation. A more complete organizational law of the People's Courts still needs to absorb more experience in future work, supplement and revise it to gradually complete it.

Now, a brief explanation of several principled issues in this regulation:

    (I) The Relationship Between the People's Court and the People

This regulation is formulated in accordance with the general spirit of the people's revolutionary regime serving the people, that is, in accordance with the general spirit of Article 17 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Abolish all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppress the people, formulate laws and decrees to protect the people, and establish a people's judicial system." Whether in the basic tasks of the court, the organizational system, or the trial work system, this revolutionary spirit of serving the people is貫穿 [貫穿貫穿: permeate, run through,貫穿] throughout. It is fundamentally different from the reactionary viewpoint of the "Six Codes" and from all anti-people court organization laws or legislative spirits.

In terms of basic tasks, the People's Court, like the People's Army and the People's Police, is one of the state machines of the People's Republic of China and an important weapon of the people's democratic regime, that is, the liberated Chinese people. Its duty is to realize its basic task of "consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, safeguarding the social order of the new democracy, and defending the people's revolutionary achievements and all legitimate rights and interests" through trials and propaganda and education to the people on observing laws and disciplines. Therefore, from its basic tasks, it represents the interests of the masses of the people. It opposes imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries who are their concentrated expression. It is completely opposite to the so-called "Six Codes" that are designed to protect the interests of a minority of reactionary ruling classes and protect the reactionary order of the Kuomintang.

In the organizational system, the People's Court is a component of the People's Government. It is responsible to the People's Government Committee and the superior court and reports its work; at the same time, in its work, it shows that it comes from the people, belongs to the people, and is responsible to the people. The two are completely consistent. It not only pays attention to the leading work of the superior organs, but also attaches importance to the lower-level organs that directly contact the people, and tries to set up appropriate courts from the perspective of facilitating people's litigation (such as setting up district People's Courts under the People's Courts of large cities, and setting up branches or divisions in necessary places in the provincial and Supreme People's Courts, etc.). This is fundamentally different from the anti-people court's hypocritical judicial independence system and the lifetime tenure system of judges, as well as the organizational system that is high above and not responsible to the people.

In the adjudication work system, first of all, the People's Court fully implements the adjudication methods and styles that are convenient for the people, connect with the people, rely on the people, and serve the people. When conducting trials, it not only relies on pleadings, confessions, and debates, but also focuses on conducting on-the-spot investigations and studies, understanding the full truth of the case and sufficient evidence before making a judgment in accordance with the law, especially for complex and major cases. Therefore, it often adopts trial methods such as on-the-spot trials, circuit trials, or people's assessors according to the needs of various different cases. Secondly, the People's Court has always attached importance to and adopted various effective methods to carry out legal discipline publicity and education work, and regards judicial publicity and education work as an important component of the trial system. This is also fundamentally different from the bureaucratic trial methods and styles of the anti-people court that are divorced from the people, and the trial work system that waits for litigation and is purely punitive.

    (II) The Relationship Between the People's Court and the People's Government at the Same Level

Regarding the leadership relationship between the People's Courts at all levels and the People's Government at the same level, that is, the issue of "vertical leadership" or "dual leadership," there have been different opinions. After multi-faceted research and exchange of opinions, we believe that the lower-level courts should be subject to the dual leadership of the superior courts and the People's Government Committee at that level. At present, only in this way can it work, and only in this way can it be beneficial and harmless, or at least more beneficial than harmful. This is not only because the Chinese revolutionary regime has developed from the local to the central, but also because China is a large country, and the Chinese revolution has just achieved basic victory. It is difficult to completely overcome the political and economic imbalances caused by the long-term rule of imperialism and feudalism, as well as the imbalances in our current work, in the short term. The different situations in various localities and the current difficult conditions require that the People's Courts at all levels below the branches of the Supreme People's Court, in addition to being subject to the vertical leadership of their superior People's Courts, also need to be subject to the unified leadership of the local People's Government Committee in accordance with local conditions. Otherwise, the Supreme People's Court will not be able to realize its correct leadership over the national judicial work in specific work. Therefore, Article 10 of the regulations clearly stipulates that "the People's Courts at all levels (including the branches and divisions of the Supreme People's Court) are components of the People's Government at the same level and are subject to the leadership and supervision of the People's Government Committee at the same level."

    (III) The People's Court and Ethnic Minorities

China is a multi-ethnic country, with regions where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, as well as regions where various ethnic groups live together. The ethnic minorities also have different socio-economic conditions, customs, habits, and languages and scripts. In these regulations, we have made necessary considerations for the characteristics of ethnic minorities. For example: Item 2 of Article 2 regarding the establishment of People's Courts equivalent to the People's Governments at all levels (county level, provincial level, or large administrative region) in various ethnic autonomous regions according to their specific circumstances, the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 11 regarding the People's Courts of counties (banners or other administrative regions or autonomous regions equivalent to counties), and the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 18 regarding the People's Courts of provinces (or administrative regions or autonomous regions equivalent to provinces) and their branches or divisions, are all provisions to take care of the special circumstances of ethnic minorities and implement the ethnic policies of the Common Program. For example, Article 9 states that "People of all ethnic groups have the right to use their ethnic language to conduct litigation; when necessary, the People's Court shall translate for them." Item 2 of the same article states: "In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities or where various ethnic groups live together, the People's Court shall conduct litigation in the local common language. Judgments, proclamations, and other documents shall be used in the languages of the relevant ethnic groups at the same time as needed." These are all provisions to take care of and respect the national cultural traditions of ethnic minorities and to facilitate the people of ethnic minorities. Obviously, this new democratic ethnic policy of ethnic equality and ethnic unity is one of the important characteristics of the organizational principles of the People's Court. It is fundamentally different from the policy of the Kuomintang reactionary government's court organization law of Han chauvinism to oppress and discriminate against ethnic minorities.

    (IV) The Levels of the People's Court

The People's Court is the judicial organ of the People's Republic of China. Article 2 of these regulations stipulates: "The following levels of People's Courts are established in the People's Republic of China: 1. County-level People's Court. 2. Provincial-level People's Court. 3. Supreme People's Court. In various ethnic autonomous regions, People's Courts equivalent to the People's Governments at all levels are established according to their specific circumstances. The establishment and organization of specialized People's Courts shall be determined separately." What needs to be explained here is: First, the People's Courts are divided into the above three levels. Second, the size of the various ethnic minority regions, the number of people, and the socio-economic and political conditions are different. Therefore, the establishment of their People's Courts only stipulates the principle of establishing People's Courts equivalent to the People's Governments at all levels according to their specific circumstances. Third, the so-called specialized People's Court refers to People's Courts that belong to a specific nature and specialized business system, such as military courts, People's Courts in land reform, and certain specialized business-natured People's Courts that may be set up in the future.

    (V) The System of Instance

The system of instance of the People's Court in these regulations is stipulated as basically implementing a three-level, two-instance system. The so-called basically implementing a three-level, two-instance system means that it is not completely equal to a three-level, two-instance system. There are also exceptional cases of three-instance final judgment and one-instance final judgment. We believe that such a provision can both guarantee the people's right to litigation and promptly and effectively punish counter-revolutionary activities, while also preventing certain cunning elements from deliberately delaying time and making unreasonable demands, causing losses to the parties concerned and social human and financial resources. At the same time, such a provision also takes into account the actual situation in China: China has a vast territory, inconvenient transportation, complex situations, and many cases. Three levels and three instances would make the people burdened with litigation for a long time and delay production. Therefore, we have adopted a basic three-level, two-instance system, which is a pragmatic and people-serving system of instance. On the other hand, if a litigant files a lawsuit or appeals beyond the level because the original People's Court cannot fairly judge, the superior People's Court will still give it the necessary treatment in accordance with the law. This is convenient for the general public.

    (VI) The Trial Organization

In order to enable the People's Court to carefully and correctly judge cases, all county-level People's Courts should have three judges deliberate and judge important or difficult cases; provincial-level and Supreme People's Courts all adopt a three-judge deliberation and judgment system; however, provincial-level People's Courts may handle cases differently depending on the work conditions and case conditions, and cases that do not require deliberation may also be judged by one judge.

In addition, the criminal court and civil court that should be set up in the trial organization, as well as the adjudication committee that may be set up according to work needs, have been specifically stipulated in the regulations and will not be explained one by one.

    (VII) Several Basic Systems in Adjudication Work

A. Regarding the People's Assessor System: The People's Assessor System is a new trial system that absorbs the participation of the masses of the people in the jury, so that the trial is combined with the masses of the people. This excellent system is fundamentally different from the hypocritical formalistic jury of the bourgeois court, and is essentially the same as the Soviet court's People's Assessor System. However, because the People's Courts in various localities currently have many cases and general working conditions cannot achieve the universal implementation of this system, only a general provision is made in Article 6 of the regulations: "The People's Assessor System shall be implemented depending on the nature of the case." This is a provision that takes into account the current actual work situation.

B. Regarding the on-the-spot investigation, on-the-spot trial, and circuit trial systems: This is a trial method that takes the mass line. It implements the spirit of the People's Court serving the people, saves the parties' human and financial resources, enables the people to directly grasp policies and decrees, and improves the people's ability to rule by law. At the same time, it makes it easier for the court to investigate evidence, clarify the facts of the case, and quickly and effectively deal with problems, and it can directly examine the effect of the trial from the masses. For example, in April of this year, the Changzhou Municipal People's Court handled the case of Shen Tingliao concealing enemy property. At first, it was conducted in the form of a sit-in trial, but there was no result for a long time. Later, the method of on-the-spot investigation, visiting the masses, and on-the-spot trial was adopted, and the truth of the case immediately came to light. Not only was the case easily solved, but also enemy property concealed outside the case was found out. This system of on-the-spot trial and circuit trial is naturally mainly implemented in scattered rural areas, but it is also applicable to some cases in cities. Therefore, it is very necessary to specifically stipulate it in the regulations.

C. Regarding the Open Trial System: For open trials, it is generally necessary to ensure that not only the parties concerned and their legal representatives have full rights to speak and defend in court, but also to give the masses attending the trial the right to speak under the premise of observing court order, in order to more accurately clarify the facts of the case.

What are the cases that should not be tried publicly? For example, cases involving state secrets, as well as certain cases that have a negative impact on society if they are made public, should not be tried publicly. However, the trials of general criminal and civil cases and counter-revolutionary cases that do not necessarily need to be tried non-publicly are all conducted publicly. This is a political education for litigants and the general public.

D. Regarding Legal Discipline Publicity and Education: Adjudication work has a significant educational effect. Through the trial or mediation of criminal and civil cases, the People's Court punishes crimes and resolves disputes, and at the same time has an active educational role.

Our People's Courts in various places have excellent traditions of connecting with the people, publicizing, and educating the people. They have widely used various trial methods to connect with the people, go out of the court, to the countryside, to the industrial and mining areas, and in places that are most convenient for the masses to participate in, carry out public trials, public pronouncements, and circuit trials, etc., so that the court becomes our podium for publicizing policies and laws and publicizing the spirit of the rule of law in our country. At the same time, various forms of publicity, such as broadcasting, reporting, blackboard newspapers, singing, typical case exhibitions, as well as symposiums, lectures, etc., are used to combine specific cases to carry out the study of legal knowledge and legal discipline education, expose the causes of crime, and point out ways to prevent crime. These are all correct, and we should affirm them. Therefore, some provisions on legal discipline publicity and education work are also made in the regulations.

The above is a brief explanation of the Provisional Organization Regulations of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China. Are there any inaccuracies? Please make corrections!

### 关于“中华人民共和国人民法院暂行组织条例”的说明

    关于“中华人民共和国人民法院暂行组织条例”的说明
    中央人民政府法制委员会代理主任委员  许德珩主席、副主席、各位委员：
    我代表中央人民政府法制委员会，作关于中华人民共和国人民法院暂行组织条例说明的报告。
    目前制订这一条例，对我们的司法工作来说，是很需要的。
    随着镇压反革命和土地改革的开展与深入，人民法院的工作日益繁重起来。各地方人民法院所收受的一般刑事和民事案件，其数目是很大的。以东北大行政区为例：一九五一年上半年，该区域内各级人民法院受理的刑、民案件，共计八万八千二百四十六件；其中刑事五万一千零五十八件，民事三万七千一百八十八件。另以北京、天津、上海、南京、武汉、广州、重庆七个大城市为例：一九五一年上半年，上述各市人民法院受理的刑、民案件，共计九万五千九百八十三件；其中刑事三万四千八百八十三件，民事六万一千一百件。再以山西、察哈尔、山东三省和皖北、苏南两行署为例：一九五一年上半年，上述各地区的人民法院受理的刑、民案件，共计十七万零七百零三件；其中刑事十万零二千六百四十一件，民事六万八千零六十二件。为了健全各级人民法院的组织和各种工作制度，为了加强人民司法工作，目前，颁行一个统一的人民法院的组织条例，也是非常必要的。
    本条例在准备和起草工作上，已经经过了长时间的研讨过程。在一九四八年冬，即由中共中央法律委员会根据老解放区的长期的人民司法工作经验着手起草。一九五零年春季以来，中央人民政府法制委员会又继续研究修改，不断地总结了华北、东北、西北、华东、中南等区关于人民法院的工作经验，研究了许多审判工作的实际材料，并参考了苏联的法院组织法及其他有关的材料，才完成了初稿，以后又经过去年第一届全国司法会议的初步讨论，并征询了中央人民政府各有关部门和地方司法机关负责同志的意见，反复修改多次，并先后提请政务院政治法律委员会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会审查修正，才成为现在的条例。现谨提请中央人民政府委员会审查作最后核定。
    由于目前我们国家的各项建设尚在开端，人民解放战争尚未最后结束，关于人民法院的组织和各种司法制度，尚难作过细的硬性规定。因此，本条例还只是通则性的暂行组织条例，更完备的人民法院组织法尚有待于今后在工作中吸取更多的经验，加以补充修改来逐步完成。
    现在把本条例中几个原则性的问题，加以扼要的说明：
            （一）人民法院与人民的
                                关系
    本条例是根据人民革命政权为人民服务的总精神制定的，即根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十七条“废除国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，制定保护人民的法律、法令，建立人民司法制度”的总精神来制定的。不管在法院的基本任务上、组织制度上和审判工作制度上，都是贯穿着这种革命的为人民服务的精神的，它与反动的“六法全书”观点，它与一切反人民的法院组织法或立法精神是根本不相同的。
    在基本任务上，人民法院和人民军队、人民警察一样，是中华人民共和国的国家机器之一，是人民民主政权亦即解放了的中国人民的重要武器之一。它的职务是通过审判和向人民进行遵守法纪宣传教育，来实现其“巩固人民民主专政，维护新民主主义的社会秩序，保卫人民的革命成果和一切合法权益”的基本任务的。所以从其基本任务来说，它就是代表人民群众的利益的。他是反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义及其集中表现的国民党反动派残余的。它是和专为保护少数反动统治阶级利益，保护国民党反动秩序的所谓“六法全书”完全相反的。
    在组织制度上，人民法院是人民政府的组成部分，它对人民政府委员会和上级法院负责并报告工作；同时在工作上又表现来自人民、属于人民和对人民负责，二者是完全一致的。它不但注重领导工作的上级机关，而且重视直接联系人民的下级机关，并尽量从便利人民诉讼着想，设置适当的法院
    （如大城市人民法院之下设区人民法院，省级及最高人民法院均在必要的地方设立分院或分庭等）。这和反人民的法院那种虚伪的司法独立制和法官终身制，以及高高在上，对人民不负责任底组织制度，是根本不相同的。
    在审判工作制度上，首先，人民法院充分实行了便利人民、联系人民、依靠人民的为人民服务的审判方法和作风。在进行审判时，不单凭诉状供词与辩论，而且对案情要着重作实地的调查研究，了解案情全部真相和充分证据后，才依法判决，特别是对于复杂重大的案情。因此，它常常根据各种不同案情的需要，而采取就地审判、巡回审判或人民陪审等审判方式。其次，人民法院一向重视并采用各种有效的方法进行法纪宣传教育工作，把司法宣传教育工作看作审判制度的一个重要组成部分。这和反人民法院的那种脱离人民的官僚主义的审判方法与作风，以及那种等待诉讼，单纯惩罚底审判工作制度，也是根本不同的。
            （二）人民法院与同级人民
                            政府的关系
    关于各级人民法院与同级人民政府的领导关系，即“垂直领导”还是“双重领导”问题，曾有过不同的意见。我们经过多方面的研究和交换意见的结果，认为下级法院应该受上级法院和该级人民政府委员会的双重领导。在现在，只有这样，才能行得通，只有这样才有利而无弊，至少是利多而弊少。这不仅因为中国的革命政权是由地方发展到中央，而且因为中国是一个大国，现在中国革命才刚刚取得基本的胜利，对于由帝国主义和封建主义的长期统治所造成的政治经济不平衡，以及我们现在工作上的不平衡，在短期间还很难完全克服。各地方不同的情况，和目前各种困难的条件，要求我们的最高法院分院以下各级人民法院除受其上级人民法院垂直领导外，同时，还需要因地制宜受当地人民政府委员会的统一领导，否则，最高人民法院，在具体工作上就不可能对全国司法工作实现其正确的领导。所以，在条例的第十条上明确的规定“各级人民法院（包括最高人民法院分院、分庭）为同级人民政府的组成部分，受同级人民政府委员会的领导和监督”。
            （三）人民法院与少数民族
    中国是一个多民族的国家，有各少数民族聚居的区域，也有各民族杂居的区域。各少数民族又尚各有其不同的社会经济条件以及风俗、习惯和语言文字。在本条例中，我们对少数民族的特点，都作了必要的照顾。例如：第二条的第二项关于各民族自治区域，依其具体情况，设立相当于各该级人民政府（县级、省级或大行政区）的人民法院的规定，第十一条的第一款关于县（旗或其他相当于县的行政区、自治区）人民法院及第十八条的第一款关于省（或相当于省的行政区、自治区）人民法院及其分院或分庭的规定，都是为了照顾少数民族的特殊情况和贯彻共同纲领民族政策的规定。又如第九条“各族人民均有使用其民族语言进行诉讼之权；必要时，人民法院应为之翻译”。同条第二项为：“在少数民族聚居或各民族杂居的地区，人民法院应以当地的通用语言，进行诉讼。判决书、布告及其他文件，应视需要同时并用各有关民族的文字”，也都是为了照顾与尊重少数民族的民族文化传统和便利少数民族人民的规定。显然，这种民族平等和民族团结的新民主主义的民族政策，是人民法院组织原则中重要的特点之一，它与国民党反动政府的法院组织法的大汉族主义的压迫和歧视少数民族的政策，是根本不同的。
            （四）人民法院的等级
    人民法院是中华人民共和国的审判机关。本条例的第二条规定了：“中华人民共和国设立下列各级人民法院：一、县级人民法院。二、省级人民法院。三、最高人民法院。各民族自治区域，依其具体情况，设立相当于各该级人民政府的人民法院。专门的人民法院之设立与组织另定之。”这里须要说明的是：第一、人民法院共分为上列三级。第二、各少数民族区域之大小，人口的多寡及社会经济、政治条件各有不同，故对其人民法院之设立，仅规定依其具体情况，设立相当于各该级人民政府的人民法院之原则的规定。第三、所谓专门的人民法院，是指属于特定性质的和专门业务系统的人民法院，例如：军事法庭，土地改革中的人民法庭，和将来可能设置的某些专门业务性质的人民法院。
            （五）审级制度
    本条例关于人民法院的审级制度，规定为基本上实行三级两审制。所谓基本上实行三级两审制，就是说不完全等于三级两审制，还有例外的三审终审和一审终审。我们认为这样的规定，是既能保障人民的诉讼权利，又能及时有效地制裁反革命活动，而又防止了某些狡猾分子，故意拖延时间，无理取闹，造成当事人以及社会人力财力的损失。同时，这样的规定，又照顾了中国的实际情况：中国地域辽阔，交通不便，情况复杂，案件又多，三级三审，是使人民为诉讼长期拖累，耽误生产，所以我们采取了基本上的三级两审制，这是一种实事求是，为人民服务的审级制。另一方面，诉讼人如因原辖人民法院不能公平审判而越级起诉或越级上诉时，上级人民法院仍依法予以必要的处理。这对于一般人民是便利的。
            （六）审判组织
    为使人民法院能慎重而又正确的审判案件，凡县级人民法院遇有重要或疑难的案件，应由审判员三人合议审判，省级和最高人民法院，均采取审判员三人合议审判制；但省级人民法院得视工作条件和案件情况分别处理，对于无须合议的案件，也可以由审判员一人审判。
    此外，于审级组织中应设置的刑事庭、民事庭，以及视工作需要，得设立的审判委员会等，均已具体规定在条例中，不再一一说明。
            （七）审判工作上的几个基
                            本制度
    甲、关于人民陪审制：人民陪审制是一种新的审判制度，它吸收人民群众参加陪审，使审判与人民群众结合起来，这种优良的制度，与资产阶级法院的那种虚伪的形式主义的陪审根本不同，而与苏联法院的人民陪审制，在本质上是一样的。但因为目前各地方人民法院案件繁多，一般工作条件还不能作到普遍地实行这一制度，所以在条例的第六条中，只作了一个概括性的规定：“应视案件性质，实行人民陪审制”。这是照顾到当前实际工作情况的规定。
    乙、关于就地调查、就地审判和巡回审判制：这是走群众路线的审判方式，它贯彻了人民法院为人民服务的精神，节省了当事人的人力和财力，使政策和法令为人民直接掌握，提高了人民的法治能力，同时，使法院便于调查证据，弄清案情，迅速有效地处理问题，并且能够直接从群众中考察审判的效果。例如今年四月间常州市人民法院处理沈廷燎隐匿敌产一案，起初用坐堂问案的方式进行，久无结果，以后采用了实地调查，访问群众，就地审判的方式，案情即刻水落石出，不但将该案迎刃而解，并且还查出了案外隐匿的敌产。这种就地审判、巡回审判的制度，自然主要是施行于分散的乡村，同时也适用城市中的若干案件。所以在条例中就把它特别规定出来，是很有必要的。
    丙、关于公开审判制度：公开审判，一般的要做到不仅当事人和他的合法辩护人在法庭上有充分的发言权和辩护权，而且在遵守法庭秩序下给旁听的群众以发言权，以求得更准确地弄清案情。
    那些是不应公开进行审判的案件呢？例如：有关国家机密的案件，以及某些公开了对社会有不良影响的案件，都是不应该公开审判的。但对一般刑事民事案件和没有不公开审判之必要的反革命案件的审判，均公开进行。这对诉讼人和一般群众是一种政治教育。
    丁、关于法纪宣传教育：审判工作是有重大的教育作用的。人民法院，通过刑、民案件的审判或调解，惩罚犯罪和解决纠纷，同时也有着积极教育的作用。
    我们各地人民法院都有联系人民、宣传教育人民的优良传统。曾是广泛地运用了各种联系人民的审判方式，走出法院大门，到农村、到工矿区、在最便利群众参加的场合下，进行公开审判、公开宣判与巡回审判等，使法庭成为我们宣传政策与法律、宣传我们国家法治精神的讲台。同时更运用了各种各样的宣传方式，如广播、报导、黑板报、演唱、典型判例展览会，以及座谈会、讲演会等，结合具体案件，进行法律知识的学习和法纪的教育，揭露犯罪原因，指出预防犯罪的办法。这些都是正确的，我们应该把它肯定下来。所以，在条例中对法纪宣传教育工作也作了若干规定。
    以上就是关于中华人民共和国人民法院暂行组织条例的简要说明。是否有当？请予核正！
                                    一九五一年九月三日
