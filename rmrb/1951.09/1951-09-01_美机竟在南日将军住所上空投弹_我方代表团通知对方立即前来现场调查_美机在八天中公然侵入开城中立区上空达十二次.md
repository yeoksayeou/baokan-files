Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 1st, urgent telegram: At 00:30 on September 1st, one U.S. aircraft intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone and dropped two bombs over General Nam Il's residence in Ice Storage Cave, landing about 500-600 meters from General Nam Il's residence. Our delegation has notified the other side to immediately send personnel to the scene for investigation.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 31st: A special correspondent of this agency reports: Since the bombing of the Kaesong conference site area by U.S. military aircraft on the night of August 22nd, incidents of U.S. aircraft illegally intruding into the airspace over Kaesong have occurred one after another, creating an impression in people's minds that the war atmosphere created by the U.S. side is again threatening Kaesong. According to further statistics, from August 23rd to August 30th, U.S. military aircraft intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone a total of twelve times, involving twenty-five sorties. At 02:40 on the morning of August 29th, one U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone and flew low and circled, dropping one flare near the conference site area, creating a new serious provocative incident.
    
From August 23rd to August 30th, the situation of U.S. aircraft intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone is as follows:
    
August 24th, 16:35, one U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong, circled once, and then flew southwest. On the same day, at 21:00, one U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the east and harassed, then flew northwest.
    
August 25th, around 16:00, seven U.S. aircraft in two groups intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the northwest, harassed, and then flew southeast. On the same day, at 22:00, one U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the east and harassed, then flew north.
    
August 26th, 11:00, two U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the northeast, harassed, and then flew southeast.
    
August 28th, around 03:00, one U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong, harassed, and then fled.
    
August 29th, 02:40, one U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong, dropped one flare near the conference site area, and then fled.
    
August 30th, 09:15, two U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the south, harassed, and then flew north; around 17:00, four U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the south, harassed, and then flew south; at 24:00, one U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the south, circled once, and then flew southeast.
    
The incidents of U.S. military aircraft intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone twelve times from August 23rd to August 30th deserve serious attention. Because, first, at the meeting held by the liaison officers of the two delegations on August 16th, the U.S. liaison officer reiterated the U.S. side's promise not to attack the Kaesong neutral zone with armed forces, and stated that this armed force included the air force. The U.S. liaison officer's re-assurance was first destroyed in the provocative incident on August 19th when the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit troops attacked the Panmunjom neutral zone and killed Yao Qingxiang, the platoon leader of our military police patrol, and then completely destroyed in the vicious plot to bomb the Kaesong conference site and murder personnel of our delegation on the night of August 22nd. The frequent activities of U.S. aircraft in the eight days since the bombing on the 22nd show that U.S. military aircraft not only completely disregard the agreement, but have also become more blatant and unscrupulous in provoking us. Second, the above-mentioned provocative acts of U.S. aircraft continuously intruding into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone provide strong evidence from another aspect for the bombing incident by U.S. aircraft on the night of August 22nd. The lies and slanders of Kenney, Joye, Ridgway, etc., can never cover up the towering crime of the U.S. aircraft bombing our delegation on the night of August 22nd, nor can they escape the serious responsibility they should bear.

    美机竟在南日将军住所上空投弹
    我方代表团通知对方立即前来现场调查
    美机在八天中公然侵入开城中立区上空达十二次
    【新华社开城一日急电】九月一日零时三十分，美国飞机一架侵入开城中立区，在冰库洞南日将军住所上空投掷炸弹二枚，落在离南日将军住所附近约五六百米处。我方代表团已通知对方立即派人前来现场调查。
   【新华社开城三十一日电】本社特派记者报道：从八月二十二日夜美国军用飞机轰炸开城会址地区事件以后，美机非法侵入开城市上空的事件接连发生，以至在人们心中造成一种印象：美方所制造的战争空气又在威胁着开城。据进一步统计，从八月二十三日到三十日的八天中，美国军用飞机又先后侵入开城中立区共达十二次，计二十五架次。八月二十九日晨二时四十分，美国军用飞机一架侵入开城中立区上空低飞盘旋，在会址区附近投下照明弹一枚，制造了新的严重的挑衅事件。
    从八月二十三日到三十日，美机侵入开城中立区的情况如下：
    八月二十四日十六时三十五分，美机一架侵入开城上空盘旋一周后向西南飞去。同日二十一时，美机一架由东面侵入开城上空骚扰后向西北飞去。
    八月二十五日十六时许，先后有美机七架两次由西北侵入开城上空，骚扰后向东南飞去。同日二十二时，美机一架由东面侵入开城上空骚扰后向北面飞去。
    八月二十六日十一时，美机两架由东北侵入开城上空骚扰后向东南飞去。
    八月二十八日三时左右，美机一架侵入开城上空骚扰后逸去。
    八月二十九日二时四十分，美机一架侵入开城上空，在会址区附近投下照明弹一枚后逸去。
    八月三十日九时十五分，美机两架由南面侵入开城上空，骚扰后向北面飞去；十七时许，美机四架由南面侵入开城上空，骚扰后向南面飞去；二十四时，美机一架由南面侵入开城上空，盘旋一周后向东南飞去。
    美国军用飞机从八月二十三日至三十日的八天中先后十二次侵入开城中立区的事件值得严重注视。因为第一，在八月十六日双方代表团联络官举行的会议上，美方联络官曾重申美方武装部队不攻击开城中立区的诺言，并言明此项武装部队包括空军在内。美方联络官的此项再度保证，首在八月十九日美李匪军袭击板门店中立区杀害我方军事警察巡逻人员姚庆祥排长的挑衅事件中被破坏，继又在八月二十二日夜轰炸开城会议地址，谋害我方代表团人员的毒辣阴谋中毫无保留地予以破坏，从二十二日轰炸事件以来八天间美机的频繁活动表明美国军用飞机不仅根本漠视协议，且已更加明目张胆肆无忌惮地向我方进行挑衅。第二，上述美机连续侵犯开城中立区上空的挑衅行为，正是给八月二十二日夜美机轰炸事件从另一方面提供了有力的证据。肯尼、乔埃、李奇微等的谎言和诬蔑，绝不能掩盖八月二十二日夜美机轰炸我方代表团的滔天罪行，也绝不能逃避其应负的严重责任。
