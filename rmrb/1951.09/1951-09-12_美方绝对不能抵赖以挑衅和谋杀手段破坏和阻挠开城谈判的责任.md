The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation to the armistice negotiations issued a statement on September 10 regarding the issue of the United Nations forces' destruction of the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations. General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, replied to Ridgway's letter of September 6 on September 11. These two documents from the Korean and Chinese sides sternly refuted the absurd and unreasonable behavior of the US side in using the so-called new suggestion of changing the meeting address to shirk their responsibility for the attacks, including shooting and bombing strafing, on the Kaesong Neutral Zone by their armed forces (including ground forces and air force), and to further obstruct the Korean negotiations. These two documents from our side firmly pointed out that only when the US side promptly ends these endless actions of destroying the agreement between the two sides regarding the Kaesong Neutral Zone and responsibly handles the various provocative incidents protested by our side, will the Korean armistice negotiations be able to continue on a normal and equal basis. Otherwise, the US side should bear full responsibility for delaying and obstructing the negotiations and their consequences. The solemn position insisted upon by our commanders and negotiation delegation correctly represents the firm will of all the Korean people and all the Chinese people. The fact that the US side used despicable and barbaric means of provocation and assassination to undermine and obstruct the Kaesong armistice negotiations is absolutely undeniable and inescapable. Therefore, all the responsibility they must bear for these crimes is also absolutely undeniable and inescapable. Yao Qingxiang, Yang Xianzhe, and Zhang Renfeng, the military police of our side who were working to maintain the safety of the Kaesong negotiation conference area that the people of the world were watching, were killed by the South Korean armed forces commanded by the United Nations Command, who were holding American weapons and wearing United Nations forces uniforms. The area of the armistice negotiation venue and near the residence of our delegation's chief representative, General Nan Ri, were subjected to three consecutive bombings and strafing by US aircraft that took off at night. From August 17 to September 8, US Air Force aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone a total of 170 sorties; incidents of the US "United Nations Forces" ground forces shooting at the Kaesong Neutral Zone and attacking the Kaesong Neutral Zone also occurred four times in a row. The US side's despicable act of undermining the most basic credibility of international negotiations and barbarically assassinating the other party's negotiation delegation, regardless of the most basic international negotiation ethics, is unprecedented in human history. At the same time, the US side's shameless denial of their criminal responsibility is also unprecedented in human history. However, up to now, the United States not only continues to refuse to admit their criminal acts and responsibly handle these serious provocative incidents, but also put forward the so-called new proposal to change the meeting address in Ridgway's letter to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai on September 6. Obviously, such a so-called proposal is not worthy of any serious consideration. Ridgway put forward this absurd demand, wanting to use this to escape their responsibility for destroying the Kaesong negotiations and create excuses for further provocative behavior. But this absurd demand proves that all the provocative acts of the US side so far are completely premeditated by the United States, and their purpose is to create a fait accompli that it is impossible to continue negotiations in the Kaesong Neutral Zone.
	However, our side not only has all the reliable personal and material evidence of the above-mentioned provocative acts by the US side, but also has reliable intelligence to prove that these criminal acts were indeed committed by the US side. According to a report from Kaesong by Takung Pao reporter Zhu Qiping on September 11, the intelligence obtained by our side has completely confirmed that all the incidents of bombing and strafing in the Kaesong Neutral Zone were deliberately created by the US side in order to force our side to accept their unreasonable demands. And because the evidence is so conclusive and undeniable and inescapable, even the US military officers, after investigating the aircraft strafing ManyueLi incident on September 10, had to say that "the evidence will be further studied," and admitted that the so-called "news that a large number of communist troops were stationed in the Kaesong Neutral Zone during the ceasefire negotiations was not confirmed." In short, it is absolutely impossible for the US side to shirk their crimes and responsibilities for undermining the Kaesong negotiations by means of provocation and assassination; it is also absolutely impossible to admit some and deny others. In any case, the US side must end their provocative actions, bear full responsibility for undermining the armistice negotiations, and responsibly handle the various provocative incidents protested by our side. This is an inescapable obligation of the US side in front of the people of the world.

### 美方绝对不能抵赖以挑衅和谋杀手段破坏和阻挠开城谈判的责任

    美方绝对不能抵赖以挑衅和谋杀手段破坏和阻挠开城谈判的责任
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团已于九月十日就联合国军破坏开城区中立化协议以阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的进行问题发表了声明，朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在九月十一日致函答覆了李奇微九月六日的来信。朝中方面的这两个文件，严厉地驳斥了美方以所谓更换会议地址的新建议来推卸他们武装部队（包括地面部队和空军）袭击开城中立区实行射击和轰炸扫射的责任，并借此进一步阻挠朝鲜谈判进行的荒谬无理行为。我方的这两个文件坚决地指出：只有在美方迅速地结束这种无休止地破坏双方关于开城区中立化协议的行动，负责处理我方所抗议的各次挑衅事件之后，朝鲜停战谈判才有可能在正常平等的基础上继续进行。否则，美方应对拖延和阻挠谈判的进行及其后果，担负全部责任。我方司令官及谈判代表团所坚持的严正立场，正确地代表了全朝鲜人民和全中国人民的坚决意志。美方以挑衅和谋杀的卑鄙野蛮手段来破坏和阻挠开城停战谈判的事实，是绝对抵赖不了的，逃避不了的。因此，他们对于这些罪行所必须担负的全部责任也是绝对抵赖不了的，逃避不了的。为了维护全世界人民所瞩望的开城谈判会议地区的安全而工作的我方军事警察姚庆祥、杨显泽和张仁凤，被手执美国武器、身穿联合国军制服的联合国军总司令部所指挥的南朝鲜武装部队杀死了。停战谈判会场地区和我方谈判代表团首席代表南日将军的住所附近，受到了夜间出动的美国飞机连续三次的轰炸扫射。自八月十七日起到九月八日止，美国空军飞机侵入开城中立区上空共达一百七十架次；美方“联合国军”地面部队向开城中立区射击及袭入开城中立区的事件也一连发生了四次。美方的这种不顾最起码的国际谈判的信义而卑鄙地破坏国际协议和野蛮地谋杀对方谈判代表团的罪恶行为，是人类历史上从来没有过的。同时，美方的如此厚颜无耻地抵赖他们的犯罪责任，也是人类历史上空前未有的。但是，直到现在为止，美国方面不但继续拒绝承认他们的罪恶行为，并对这些严重挑衅事件作负责的处理，而且又在九月六日李奇微致金日成、彭德怀两将军的信中提出了更换会议地址的所谓新建议。很明显，这样的所谓建议是不值得任何郑重考虑的。李奇微提出这种荒谬要求，想要借此逃避他们破坏开城谈判的责任，并为进一步的挑衅行为制造藉口。但是这种荒谬要求，正是证明了美方对于迄今为止的一切挑衅行为完全是美国的预谋，其目的就是要造成无法在开城中立区继续谈判的既成事实。
    但是，我方不但握有上述美方挑衅行为的一切可靠的人证物证，而且也握有证实这些犯罪行为确实是美方所为的可靠的情报。据大公报记者朱启平九月十一日自开城报道，我方所获得的情报已经完全证实：轰炸扫射开城中立区的一切事件，确是美方为了迫使我方接受他们的无理要求而蓄意制造出来的。而由于证据是如此确凿而无可抵赖和逃避，就是美方军官在九月十日调查了飞机扫射满月里事件之后，也只好说“证据将进一步予以研究”，并且承认所谓“关于在停火谈判期间有大批共军留驻在开城中立区的一条消息没有得到证实”了。总之，美方要想推卸他们以挑衅和谋杀的手段来破坏开城谈判的罪行和责任，是绝对办不到的；要想承认一部分，抵赖另一部分，也是绝对不可能的。无论如何，美方必须结束他们的挑衅行为，担负他们破坏停战谈判的全部责任，并对我方所抗议的各次挑衅事件作负责的处理。这是美方在全世界人民面前无可逃避的义务。
