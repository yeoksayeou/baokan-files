Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. The Northern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Delegation led by Liu Jingfan and all members of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia sub-delegation visited Yan'an, the democratic holy land.

	On the afternoon of August 30th, over ten thousand people from all walks of life in Yan'an held a grand welcoming meeting to welcome the visiting delegation. At the meeting, representatives from all walks of life in Yan'an and the people of Yangjialing and Zaoyuan villages, where Chairman Mao once lived, presented flags and local products to the visiting delegation, asking them to pass them on to Chairman Mao.
	On the 31st, the visiting delegation and representatives from all walks of life in Yan'an swept the tombs of martyrs Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Ye Ting, Deng Fa, Guan Xiangying, Yang Song, and others at the Martyrs' Cemetery in the eastern suburbs of Yan'an. In the afternoon, the delegation split into three groups to visit Chairman Mao's former residences—Yangjialing, Zaoyuan, and Wangjiaping villages. The head of the visiting delegation, Liu Jingfan, and others held discussions with the masses in front of the cave dwelling where Chairman Mao lived in Yangjialing village. The villagers were very excited when they heard about Chairman Mao's concern for them in Beijing. Yang Genwang, a sixty-year-old family member of a martyr, was moved to tears. He said, "Chairman Mao was like one of us here, concerned about our production and well-being, sending doctors to treat our illnesses, and even toasting me during the New Year. When Japanese planes came to bomb, he sent people to help me move. This time, he sent a visiting delegation to comfort us. We must work hard in production and be like Chairman Mao was here.” Yang Zaiqing said: "When Chairman Mao lived here, he was very concerned about our production. He asked me why I harvested the crops before they were ripe. I said there were insects. After studying it, he found that there were paddy stem borers, so he called on everyone to dig out the rice stubble and burn the insects to death. This way, there were no paddy stem borers the following year." Then everyone reported on the restoration of war damage. This year, the village's production plan has been basically completed. Every household has a fly swatter, and dogs are tied with ropes, chickens have cages, pigs have pens, toilets are cleaned once a day, bleach is regularly put in the wells, bedding is sunned three times a week, and everyone in the village has been vaccinated twice. Therefore, there were no epidemics this year. There are reading groups within the work-exchange teams, which regularly carry out cultural and political studies. Everyone also raised many questions regarding increasing sheep loans and preferential treatment work, which Liu Jingfan answered one by one. Finally, everyone expressed their determination to do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea, helping the families of martyrs and soldiers in their production, planting winter wheat well, harvesting, drying, and storing all autumn crops before the end of September, and leading the way in paying public grain to respond to Chairman Mao's concern with practical actions.
