    Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from San Francisco: Hours after the signing of the US-made Treaty of Peace with Japan on the 8th, US Secretary of State Acheson and Japanese puppet Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida signed the so-called "US-Japan Security Treaty" in San Francisco. This treaty is an inseparable part of the US-made Treaty of Peace with Japan, and its purpose is to continue to turn Japan into a US military base and colony.

    The full text of the "Security Treaty" consists of five articles. Article 1 stipulates: "Japan grants, and the United States of America accepts the right to dispose United States land, air and sea forces in and about Japan. Such forces may be utilized to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East and to the security of Japan against armed attack from without." This fully illustrates the falsity of the US-made treaty's recognition of Japan's so-called "full sovereignty." According to the provisions of the "Security Treaty," the US troops stationed in Japan will not only be used for the US's aggressive wars in the Far East, but will also be used, "upon the express request of the Japanese Government," to "put down" so-called "large-scale riots and disturbances" within Japan. As everyone knows, for six years the US occupation forces have consistently been the executioners suppressing the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy.

    Article 3 of the treaty vaguely states: "The conditions which shall govern the disposition of armed forces of the United States of America in and about Japan shall be determined by administrative agreement between the two Governments." The content of the so-called "administrative agreement" has been deliberately withheld from public release by the US and Japan. However, foreign bourgeois news agencies have already leaked some of the contents of this secret agreement, which more harshly enslaves the Japanese people. According to a United Press dispatch from San Francisco on the 7th, citing "reliable sources," the "two closely guarded documents of military base and administration details" of the "Security Treaty" (i.e., the so-called "administrative agreement") stipulate: "The US Army will be able to use designated camps and headquarters areas in Hokkaido, Honshu, and Kyushu. Ten air bases - including three military airfields near Tachikawa, 40 miles west of Tokyo - will be leased to the US Air Force. The two naval bases of Yokosuka and Sasebo will be retained (by the US). Military headquarters will be located in Tachikawa," "Naval headquarters and ordnance headquarters will continue to be stationed in Yokosuka and Yokohama." Furthermore, "The 'administrative agreement' 'does not impose restrictions on US troops stationed at designated bases'," and stipulates that "US troops can move freely on Japanese highways and have the right to conduct military training in rural areas agreed upon by both parties," "US troops can use Japan's postal and telecommunications equipment and other public utilities." These provisions have completely turned Japan into a vast US barracks, thereby fundamentally undermining Japan's sovereignty. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from New York on August 18, another "main clause of the secret agreement concerns the restoration of Japanese armed forces." The Japanese "army (including the police) will be divided into twenty light divisions."

    On the 8th, Acheson and Yoshida also exchanged notes, further affirming Japan's obligation to assist the US in its aggressive war under the guise of the "United Nations." Acheson acknowledged in his note: "Japan has given and is now giving substantial assistance to the United Nations action (referring to the war of aggression against Korea)," and demanded that the Japanese government "confirm that when the forces of one or more of the Members of the United Nations are engaged in any United Nations action in the Far East after the effective date of the Treaty of Peace, Japan will permit and assist such forces of such Member or Members of the United Nations as may be supporting such United Nations action in or about Japan, including the use of facilities and areas in Japan. The cost of the use of such facilities and areas shall be borne as a gift or in such other manner as may be mutually agreed upon by Japan and the Member or Members of the United Nations concerned." Yoshida, in his note, obsequiously confirmed the US demands on behalf of the Japanese government.

    There is no doubt that the so-called "US-Japan Security Treaty" and the separate "Treaty of Peace with Japan," which bring great disaster to the Japanese people, will be resolutely opposed by the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the Far East.

    作为美国非法“对日和约”的不可分的一部分
    艾奇逊吉田签订“美日安全条约”
    “条约”规定美军留驻日本广泛使用日本军事基地并驱使日本在“联合国”名义下充当侵略战争帮凶
    【新华社十日讯】旧金山消息：在八日美制对日和约签字之后数小时，美国国务卿艾奇逊和日本傀儡首相吉田茂又在旧金山签订了所谓“美日安全条约”。这一条约是美制对日和约的不可分的一部分，其目的在于使美国继续把日本变为美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    “安全条约”的全文共五条，其中第一条规定：“在和约和本约生效之日，日本承认美国有在日本国内及周围驻扎其陆、海、空军之权利，美利坚合众国接受此种权利。”这充分说明美制和约承认日本享有所谓“充分主权”的虚伪性。根据“安全条约”的规定，美国在日本的驻军不仅将用来进行美国在远东的侵略战争，并且将“根据日本政府的特别要求”，用来“镇压”日本国内的所谓“大规模暴动和骚乱”。大家知道，六年来美国占领军就一贯是镇压日本人民争取独立、和平、民主运动的刽子手。
    条约第三条暧昧地说：“美利坚合众国之武装部队在日本国内及周围分布的条件应由两国政府之间的行政协定决定之。”所谓“行政协定”的内容，美日双方故意未予公布。但外国资产阶级通讯社已经泄露了这个更苛刻地奴役日本人民的秘密协定的某些内容。据合众社旧金山七日电引“消息可靠人士”透露：“安全条约”的“两个保守秘密的关于军事基地和行政事宜的细节的文件”（按即所谓“行政协定”）规定：“美国陆军将可以使用日本北海道、本州与九州的指定军营与总部地区。十个空军基地——包括在东京以西四十哩的立川附近的三个军用机场——将租与美国空军。横须贺和佐世保这两个海军基地将（由美国）予以保留。军事总部将设在立川”，“海军总部和军需总部将继续驻在横须贺和横滨”。并且，“在朝鲜战争期间，美国有权在它的日本的一个军事基地上维持远东军总部”。此外，“行政协定”“不对驻在指定的基地的美军加以限制”，并规定：“美军可以在日本公路上自由行动，并且有权在双方协议的乡村地区练兵”，“美军可以使用日本的邮电交通设备以及其他公用事业”。这些规定已把日本完全变成美国的庞大兵营，从而根本破坏了日本的主权。另据法新社八月十八日纽约电透露，秘密协定的另一“主要条款是关于日本武装部队的恢复”。日本“军队（包括警察）将分成二十个轻装师团”。
    八日，艾奇逊并与吉田互换照会，进一步肯定日本有义务协助美国假借“联合国”名义进行的侵略战争。艾奇逊在其照会中承认：“日本以前和现在都给予联合国行动（按指侵朝战争）以重大援助”，并要求日本政府“确认：当联合国一个或一个以上会员国的军队在和约生效之后在远东从事任何联合国行动时，日本将允许并协助一个或一个以上会员国在日本境内及日本附近支持从事这种联合国行动的军队。其使用日本的设备及劳务所需费用应作为馈赠，或按日本与有关的联合国会员国彼此协议的办法负担之。”吉田在其照会中奴颜婢膝地代表日本政府确认了美国的要求。
    毫无疑问，美帝国主义为日本人民带来巨大灾难的所谓“美日安全条约”和单独“对日和约”，必将遭到日本人民和远东各国人民的坚决反对。
