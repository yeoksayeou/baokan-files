    A New Measure for Democratic Management of State-Owned Enterprises

    Recently, the Beijing Public Transportation Company, after a meeting of employee representatives, elected two deputy managers. Upon recommendation by the labor union and appointment by the administration, they have begun to perform their duties. This is a creative new measure for state-owned enterprises to further rely on the masses of workers, strengthen democratic management, and lead production.

    In the past, the most fundamental and serious problem in the work of the Beijing Public Transportation Company was the lack of reliance on the masses of workers by the administrative leaders and an extreme lack of mass perspective. They ignored the opinions and rationalization proposals put forward by the employees; they delayed resolving welfare issues that employees urgently needed and could be resolved; even though they could solve the problem of workers staying overnight in the factory for the convenience of taking over shifts, they refused to agree, letting the workers wander outside the factory in the middle of the night without caring; even opening a window in the dormitory or adding a kettle on the bus was excused by budget difficulties and no effort was made to solve them. This caused great dissatisfaction among the employees, seriously affecting their enthusiasm for production and resulting in the company's losses, which could not be made up for a long time.

    After inspecting the work of the Public Transportation Company, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to improve the company's work, especially to correct the phenomenon of leadership being divorced from the masses, decided to remove the company's general manager and deputy manager, re-elect the party's general branch committee, re-appoint the manager, and suggest that the labor union convene a meeting of employee representatives to elect two deputy managers. This decision was warmly supported by all employees of the company. We believe that the method of electing administrative leaders by employees, recommending them by the labor union, and reviewing and appointing them by the competent authorities is correct. This is very beneficial to improving the democratic management of industrial and mining enterprises. As a result of doing so, the sense of ownership of the working masses will be greatly strengthened, the sense of responsibility of the working masses for their own state-owned enterprises will be enhanced, the supervisory role of all employees over administrative leadership will be brought into play, and at the same time, the administrative leadership will be made to improve the spirit of being responsible to the employees, frequently consider adopting the suggestions put forward by the employees that are conducive to production, care about solving the welfare problems of the employees, overcome the bureaucratic style of thinking of some enterprise administrative cadres who do not rely on the employees, and closely connect the leadership with the masses.

    As everyone knows, our country currently lacks a large number of experienced enterprise management personnel. One of the main ways to solve this problem is to continuously train and select outstanding elements from the masses of employees as the leading backbone of enterprises. But how should such leading backbone be selected? The Beijing Public Transportation Company has adopted the method of relying on the masses of employees to conduct elections, and the facts have proved that the results of the elections are good.

    This experience shows that in state-owned enterprises led by the working class, as long as the political education and production competition movement have been carried out for a certain period of time, the consciousness of the masses has been raised, and advanced activists who have been tested and have prestige among the masses have emerged, administrative leaders can be elected by the masses of workers under these conditions; as long as the importance of electing and recommending administrative leaders is publicized to the masses of employees during the election, it is possible and can be guaranteed to do a good job in the election and recommendation. If the competent authority believes that the results of the employee elections cannot be approved during the review, it can also ask the employees to reconsider. As long as the reasons are sufficient and reasonable, the masses will not only not refuse, but will also actively request re-election. This spring, the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill elected some workshop foremen. They are now generally working very well, and are more qualified than the original foremen, which is another powerful proof.

    We believe that the experience of the Beijing Public Transportation Company has provided a new content for the democratic management of industrial and mining enterprises and the work of labor unions, which is worthy of consideration and reference by various places.

    国营企业民主管理的一项新措施
    最近北京市公共汽车公司经过职工代表会议选举两位副经理，并经工会推荐，行政任命，开始执行职务了。这是国营企业进一步依靠工人群众，加强民主管理，领导生产的创造性的新措施。
    过去北京市公共汽车公司的工作最基本和最严重的问题，就是行政领导干部不依靠工人群众，群众观点极端缺乏。他们对于职工所提出的意见和合理化建议，置之不理；对于职工迫切需要而又可能解决的福利问题，拖延不办；对于工人为了接班方便在厂里过夜的要求，虽然能够解决也不答应，听任工人半夜里在厂外遛马路而漠不关心；甚至于在宿舍开个窗户、在车上添个水壶等也藉口预算困难而不设法解决。因此引起职工极大不满，严重影响职工的生产积极性；并招致公司的亏损，长期不能弥补。
    中共北京市委和北京市人民政府公用局经过检查汽车公司的工作之后，为了改进该公司的工作，特别是纠正领导脱离群众的现象，决定撤换该公司的正副经理，改选党的总支委员会，重新委派了经理，并建议工会召开职工代表会，选举两名副经理。这一决定得到了该公司全体职工的热烈拥护。我们认为由职工选举、工会推荐、主管当局审核任命行政领导干部的办法，是正确的。这对于改进工矿企业的民主管理工作是有很大好处的。这样做的结果，将大大地加强工人群众的主人翁思想，提高工人群众对自己的国家企业的责任心，发挥全体职工对行政领导的监督作用，同时也将使行政领导方面提高对职工负责的精神，经常考虑采纳职工所提出的有利于生产的建议，关心解决职工群众的生活福利问题，克服某些企业行政干部不依靠职工群众的官僚主义的思想作风，密切领导与群众的联系。
    大家都知道，目前我们的国家是缺乏大量有经验的企业管理人员的。解决这个问题的主要办法之一，就是要不断从职工群众中培养、选拔优秀分子作为企业的领导骨干。但是应该如何选拔这样的领导骨干呢？北京市公共汽车公司采取了依靠职工群众进行选举的办法，并且事实已经证明选举的结果是良好的。
    这个经验说明，在工人阶级领导的国家企业中，只要经过一定时期的政治教育和生产竞赛运动，群众觉悟已经提高，涌现了经过考验的、在群众中有威信的先进的积极分子，在这些条件下就可以由工人群众选举行政领导干部；在选举时只要向职工群众宣传选举和推荐行政领导干部的重要意义，就有可能并可保证把选举推荐工作做好。如果职工群众选举的结果，主管机关在审核时认为不能批准，还可以提请职工重新考虑，只要理由充分合理，群众不但不会拒绝，而且会主动要求重新改选的。今年春天北京市清河制呢厂曾选举了一部分车间的工长。他们现在一般都工作得很好，而且比原来的工长更加称职，这又是一个有力的证明。
    我们认为北京市公共汽车公司的经验，对于工矿企业的民主管理和工会工作，已经提供了一项新的内容，值得各地考参。
