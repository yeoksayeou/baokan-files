Twenty years ago today, on September 18, 1931, the Mukden Incident occurred, and Japanese imperialism launched its armed invasion of China. From that day on, the Chinese people began their armed struggle against Japan. On July 7, 1937, Japanese imperialism further launched the Lugou Bridge Incident, attempting to conquer all of China, and this armed struggle against Japan developed into a full-scale war of resistance against Japan. In this war, the Chinese people fought heroically for a full eight years, until the defeat and surrender of Japanese imperialism. Ironclad facts prove that the Chinese people endured the longest period, suffered the greatest sacrifices, and made the most contributions in the great war that defeated Japanese imperialism. However, the United States government openly violated all international agreements, excluded the People's Republic of China, and convened the San Francisco Conference on September 4, 1951, which it single-handedly orchestrated, and signed a separate peace treaty with Japan at this conference on September 8. All our people have expressed their indignation and opposition to this. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China considers it necessary to reaffirm that the statement authorized by me on August 15, 1951, regarding the draft US-British peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference, remains valid. At the same time, I am authorized to issue the following statement on this matter:

	1. The separate peace treaty with Japan forcibly signed by the United States government at the San Francisco Conference without the participation of the People's Republic of China is not only not a comprehensive treaty, but also not a real treaty at all. It is merely a treaty that revives Japanese militarism, antagonizes China and the Soviet Union, threatens Asia, and prepares for a new war of aggression. The United States government and the Japanese Yoshida government signed the US-Japan bilateral security treaty a few hours after signing the so-called peace treaty, clearing the way for rearming Japan and turning Japan completely into a US military base. This is ironclad proof that the United States government is preparing for a larger-scale war of aggression in Asia and the Far East.The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan and US-Japan bilateral security treaty forcibly signed by the United States government have already posed a serious threat to the security of the People's Republic of China and the security of many other Asian countries. The Chinese people must resolutely oppose the United States government's vicious conspiracy to intensify preparations for a new war of aggression by using the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan and the so-called US-Japan bilateral security treaty.

	2. Because the United States government so unreasonably and stubbornly refused the opinions of the Soviet, Polish, and Czech representatives regarding the invitation of the People's Republic of China to participate in this conference at the San Francisco Conference, and refused the various basic proposals made by the Soviet Union regarding peace with Japan in accordance with the spirit of international agreements, and because the United States government disregarded the will and hopes of Asian countries and rejected the proposals of India and Burma, the San Francisco Conference and the separate peace treaty with Japan signed at this conference not only cannot represent but violate the opinions of the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Asia, as well as the people of the world. The San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan created by the United States government, as well as the US-Japan bilateral security treaty, cannot bring peace to Asia and the world, but can only increase the current tension in Asia and the world. There is no doubt that this war preparation action by the United States government, which is creating tension in Asia and the world, just like its armed intervention in Korea, cannot but arouse the resolute opposition of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the people of the world, the people of all Asia, and the governments of any countries that do not approve of the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan, especially the countries of Asia, to prevent the crisis of expanding the Far East war caused by the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan and the US-Japan bilateral security treaty, so as to ensure Asian peace and world peace.

	3. The San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan and the US-Japan bilateral security treaty are by no means a lenient and beneficial peace treaty for Japan, but a war treaty that attempts to drag Japan into a new war of aggression and plunge the Japanese nation into destruction. Because the reactionary group within the Japanese ruling class that serves American imperialism vainly attempts to revive militarism and does not hesitate to sell out the country's independence and sovereignty, it has signed the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the US-Japan bilateral security treaty, so that the entire Japan is already facing an unprecedented national crisis. This cannot but inspire the Japanese people to make further struggles against the aggressive policies of American imperialism and the traitorous group in Japan. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is willing to see the Japanese people obtain democracy, independence, peace, and progress, and the Chinese people are willing to live in peace with the Japanese people, unite in friendship, so as to guarantee peace in the Far East. Therefore, we, the Chinese people, express our infinite welcome and sympathy for the struggle of patriotic people from all walks of life in Japan against the San Francisco traitorous treaty, and for their efforts to strive for a swift end to the state of war between China and Japan and to ensure peaceful coexistence. We firmly believe that the struggle of the Japanese people will surely receive the warm welcome and support of peace-loving people all over the world, and we firmly believe that the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.

	4. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China declares once again: Because the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan was not prepared, drafted, and signed with China's participation, the Central People's Government considers it illegal, invalid, and therefore absolutely unacceptable.

    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来关于美国及其仆从国家签订旧金山对日和约的声明
    （一九五一年九月十八日）
    远在二十年前的今天，一九三一年九月十八日，沈阳事变发生，日本帝国主义就发动了对中国的武装侵略。从这一天起，我中国人民就开始了武装抗日斗争。至一九三七年七月七日，日本帝国主义进一步发动了企图征服全中国的芦沟桥事变，这种武装抗日斗争就发展而为全中国的抗日战争。中国人民在这个战争中，英勇奋斗，整整八年，一直打到日本帝国主义失败投降。铁一般的事实证明：中国人民在击败日本帝国主义的伟大战争中，经过时间最久，遭受牺牲最大，所作贡献最多。然而，美国政府却公然违反一切国际协议，排斥中华人民共和国，于一九五一年九月四日召开了一手包办的旧金山会议，并于九月八日在这一会议上，签订了对日单独和约。我全国人民对此无不表示愤慨和反对。中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为有必要重申一九五一年八月十五日授权本人发表的关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明继续有效，同时，并授权本人再就此事发表下列声明：
    一、美国政府在旧金山会议中强制签订的没有中华人民共和国参加的对日单独和约，不仅不是全面和约，而且完全不是真正和约，这只是一个复活日本军国主义、敌视中苏、威胁亚洲、准备新的侵略战争的条约。美国政府与日本吉田政府在签订所谓和约数小时之后，随即签订了美日双边安全条约，为重新武装日本并把日本完全变为美国军事基地廓清道路。这就是美国政府正在亚洲和远东准备更大规模的侵略战争的铁证。中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为美国政府强制签订的旧金山对日和约及美日双边安全条约，业已对中华人民共和国的安全以及其他许多亚洲国家的安全，构成了严重的威胁。中国人民对于美国政府利用旧金山对日和约以及所谓美日双边安全条约来加紧准备新的侵略战争的恶毒阴谋，一定要坚决反对到底。
    二、由于美国政府在旧金山会议中如此横蛮无理和顽固地拒绝苏联、波兰和捷克代表关于邀请中华人民共和国参加这次会议的意见，并拒绝苏联根据国际协议的精神而提出的关于对日媾和的各项基本建议，又由于美国政府不顾亚洲国家的意志和希望，拒绝了印度和缅甸的建议，因此，旧金山会议以及这一会议上所签订的对日单独和约不仅不能代表而且违反着中国、苏联和亚洲人民以及全世界人民的意见。美国政府制造的旧金山对日和约，以及美日双边安全条约，决不能为亚洲和世界带来和平，而只能增加目前亚洲和世界的紧张局势。毫无疑问，美国政府这一造成亚洲和世界紧张局势的备战行动，正如它在朝鲜所进行的武装干涉一样，不能不引起全世界人民，首先是亚洲人民的坚决反对。中国人民愿意与全世界人民、全亚洲人民、以及任何不赞成旧金山对日和约的国家首先是亚洲的国家的政府，共同努力，制止由旧金山对日和约及美日双边安全条约所造成的扩大远东战争的危机，以求亚洲和平和世界和平获得保障。
    三、旧金山对日和约以及美日双边安全条约，对于日本也决不是什么宽大有利的和平条约，而是企图将日本拖入新的侵略战争、陷日本民族于毁灭的战争条约。由于日本统治阶级内部为美帝国主义服务的反动集团，妄想复活军国主义，竟不惜出卖国家的独立与主权，签订了旧金山和约以及美日双边安全条约，以致整个日本业已面临着空前未有的民族危机。这就不能不激发日本人民为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和日本的卖国集团而作进一步的奋斗。中华人民共和国中央人民政府是愿意看到日本人民获得民主、独立、和平和进步的，中国人民是愿意与日本人民和平相处，友好团结，以保障远东和平的。因此，对于日本全国各阶层爱国人民反对旧金山卖国条约的斗争，以及他们争取中日两国迅速结束战争状态和保障和平相处关系的努力，我中国人民表示无限欢迎与同情。我们深信日本人民的斗争，一定同样能够得到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎和支持，并深信日本人民
    一定能够得到最后的胜利。
    四、中华人民共和国中央人民政府再一次声明：旧金山对日和约由于没有中华人民共和国参加准备、拟制和签订，中央人民政府认为是非法的，无效的，因而是绝对不能承认的。
