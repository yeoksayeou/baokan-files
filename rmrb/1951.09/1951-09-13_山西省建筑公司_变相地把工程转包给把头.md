    Shanxi Provincial Construction Company
    Covertly Subcontracts Projects to Foremen

    To the Editor:

    The state-owned Shanxi Provincial Construction Company in Taiyuan should not purchase gravel from the feudal foreman Zhang Jie. Because Zhang Jie is a large-scale construction contractor, he does not have gravel to sell himself. After he accepted this deal, he still found a small foreman to lead workers to knock gravel in the eastern mountains of Taiyuan. Therefore, the gravel workers are still being exploited by the feudal foremen. The practice of Shanxi Provincial Construction Company buying gravel from a large-scale contractor is actually acknowledging the foreman system and is covertly subcontracting the project to foremen. Worker Cui Xilin and 27 others worked for the small foreman Fan Youxiang for more than 20 days and did not receive their wages, and could not even afford to eat. On September 4, worker Lian Jingrong represented the workers in asking Fan Youxiang for wages. Not only did Fan Youxiang not pay the wages, but he also severely beat Lian Jingrong. Lian Jingrong was injured in the waist and vomited blood, and is now unable to move. On September 5, the workers carried the injured Lian Jingrong from the eastern mountains to the Shanxi Provincial Construction Company. The trade union cadre said to the company manager Wang Zhengping, "Let's first send the injured worker to the clinic, and then jointly study and deal with this issue." Wang Zhengping said, "We bought the gravel, these are not our workers, and it has nothing to do with us; it doesn't matter if the workers see a doctor in the company's clinic." From this incident, it seems that the leading cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Construction Company have not taken a resolute attitude towards the struggle against the feudal foremen, and have shown indifference to the suffering of the workers.

    We suggest that relevant departments investigate and deal with this matter, and hope that Comrade Wang Zhengping, manager of Shanxi Provincial Construction Company, can conduct ideological self-criticism.

### 山西省建筑公司  变相地把工程转包给把头

    山西省建筑公司
    变相地把工程转包给把头编辑同志：
    太原市公营山西省建筑公司不应向封建把头张杰购买石子。因为张杰是包工大柜，自己并没有石子出卖，他应承下这笔买卖以后，仍然是找了小工头带领工人到太原东山去敲打石子；因此，打石子的工人仍然是受着封建包工头的剥削。山西省建筑公司向包工大柜买石子的做法，实际上就是承认把头制度，并且是变相地把工程转包给把头的行为。工人崔喜林等二十八人，给小把头范有祥做工二十多天，没有领到工钱，连饭也吃不上。九月四日工人连景荣代表工人向范有祥要工钱，范有祥不但不给工钱，反将连景荣痛殴一顿。连景荣被打伤腰部，并吐了血，现已不能动弹。九月五日，工人将被打伤之连景荣由东山抬到山西省建筑公司，工会干部向公司经理王正平说：“咱们先把受伤工人送到诊疗所，然后再共同研究处理这个问题。”王正平却说：“我们是买的石子，这不是我们的工人，和我们没关系；工人要看病在公司的诊疗所倒没有什么。”从这件事看来，山西省建筑公司的领导干部对于反对封建把头的斗争并没有采取坚决的态度，而且表现了对工人痛苦漠不关心。
    我们建议有关部门对此事进行调查处理，并希望山西省建筑公司经理王正平同志能进行思想检查。
