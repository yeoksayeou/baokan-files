    Volunteer Army Representatives Gloriously Return to the Front Yesterday
    Issue Statement Before Departure, Calling for Continued Strengthening of National Defense
    To Convey Great Achievements of Domestic Resistance Against America and Aid Korea to the Entire Army
    [By Our Newspaper] At the invitation of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, ten comrades from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, including Chai Chuanruo, Ji Bingqian, and Gao Chao, who returned to the country to report to the people of the whole country on the heroic fighting deeds of the Chinese and Korean People's forces on the Korean front, returned to the Korean front by train from Beijing at 4:10 pm on the 22nd. More than 200 representatives from 17 units of various democratic parties and people's organizations in the capital went to the station to see them off.
    Since the beginning of March, the Volunteer Army representatives have been divided into three groups to report on the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean People's forces fighting side by side on the Korean front. Chai Chuanruo, Dong Lefu, and Dou Shaojie went to East China and Central South China for 175 days; Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, and Zhang Fu went to Northwest and Southwest China for 170 days; Gao Chao, Wang Yougen, Li Jitao, and Wang Jianhun went to North China for 105 days. They went to 24 provinces, passed through 172 cities and counties, and traveled a total of more than 102,000 li. In the Northwest, they reached Yili on the Sino-Soviet border and Kashgar city on the Pamir Plateau on the Sino-Indian border. In the Southwest, they reached Longling and Mangshi on the Sino-Myanmar border in western Yunnan and Hekou city on the Sino-Vietnamese border on the Red River. And the southeast coast. They participated in 729 welcome meetings and reports, 28 radio speeches, and 130 small forums, totaling 907 gatherings. A total of 10,250,000 people in various places met them directly and heard reports, more than 30 million heard broadcasts, and 8 million people participated in welcome and farewell events.
    Everywhere the Volunteer Army representatives went, they were welcomed by crowds of people. For example, in Suzhou, Xi'an, Kunming, Wuzhou and other cities, more than 100,000 people participated in the welcome and farewell events. In Yangzhou, Wuhu, Luoyang, Dihua and other cities with a population of more than 100,000, the number of people participating in the welcome reached 70,000 to 80,000. The same was true in the countryside. Almost all villages in the counties of western Sichuan, the areas along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, the coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian, and the mountainous areas of western Hunan had people participating in the welcome.
    The people of the motherland showed special love and concern for the Volunteer Army representatives. Wherever they went, they received warm condolences from the local people. The Volunteer Army representatives personally received 11.9 billion yuan in condolences, more than 500,000 letters of condolence, more than 200,000 items of condolence, more than 100,000 condolence bags, more than 20,000 bouquets of flowers symbolizing glory and victory, and a large number of books, newspapers and other precious gifts. The reports made by the Volunteer Army representatives in various places have played a major role in promoting the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement in various places. Before leaving, the representatives expressed that after returning to the front line, they would convey to all Volunteer Army comrades in detail the great achievements of various construction undertakings in the motherland, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the work of preferential treatment in various places, and the enthusiastic donation of aircraft and artillery by the people of the whole country and their love and care for the Volunteer Army. They also expressed that in order to defend the sacred territory of the motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, they must make unremitting struggles and annihilate more American aggressors in order to repay the love of the people of the motherland.
        (Li Ruo)
   Xinhua News Agency, dated 22nd: Chinese People's Volunteer Army representatives Chai Chuanruo, Ji Bingqian, Gao Chao, etc., made the following statement to reporters from this agency before leaving Beijing to return to the Korean front:
    In the nearly half a year since we Volunteer Army representatives returned to the motherland from the front line, we have traveled all over the country and have seen the great achievements of our people's patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea everywhere. Our activities in various parts of the country are part of the Chinese people's Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, and our activities have promoted the further in-depth and extensive development of this movement. We, as a bridge between the front and the rear, have connected and strengthened the ties between the Volunteer Army and the people of the motherland. This is the achievement of our work in the past half year.
    We are now going back to the Korean front. The enemy is doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage the Kaesong armistice talks and continue to adhere to its policy of aggression. After we go back, we must deeply convey to the Volunteer Army the love and hope of the people of the whole country for the Volunteer Army and the great achievements of the motherland's construction, so that all Volunteer Army comrades know that the people of the whole country are doing their best to support us. We must guard our posts and defeat the enemy who dares to invade with greater strength. We must contribute all our strength to the solemn cause of striving for peace and defending peace.
    We have had extensive contact with the national Resist America and Aid Korea Movement. Before leaving the motherland, we would like to offer some suggestions for the further development of this movement:
    (1) The Resist America and Aid Korea Movement must not be relaxed due to the existing achievements. American imperialism is forever the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, and it will never give up its conspiracy to invade China. Therefore, we must ensure that everyone participates in the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, and that we participate in the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement every day. As long as the enemy exists, we must strengthen our national defense.
    (2) Patriotic pacts should be more specific and tailored to the specific circumstances of each person, each household, and each locality. The donation movement should rely on increased production, not emphasize emptying pockets, not apportion, and not hinder learning. The preferential treatment of the families of martyrs and soldiers should mainly focus on doing a good job in substituting for farming, organizing production, and introducing occupations, and should not rely solely on relief.
    (3) The items donated to the front should meet the actual needs of the soldiers. For example, in terms of spiritual food, we can donate more popular and easy-to-understand books and paintings such as pamphlets or comic strips on Resist America and Aid Korea; the content of the letters of condolence should be more practical and specific, so that they can more powerfully encourage the soldiers; the condolence items are best things that can be eaten or used.

    志愿军归国代表昨光荣重返前线
    行前发表谈话，号召继续增强国防力量
    要把国内抗美援朝伟大成就向全军传达
    【本报讯】应中国人民抗美援朝总会的邀请，回国向全国人民报告中朝人民部队在朝鲜前线的英勇战斗事迹的中国人民志愿军代表柴川若、嵇炳前、高巢等十位同志，已于二十二日下午四时十分由北京乘车返朝鲜前线。赴车站欢送的，有首都各民主党派、各人民团体共十七个单位的代表二百余人。
    自三月初开始，志愿军归国代表分成三组，赴各地报告中朝人民部队在朝鲜前线并肩作战的英勇事迹。柴川若、董乐辅、窦少毅三人去华东、中南，历时一百七十五天；嵇炳前、李维英、张甫三人去西北、西南，历时一百七十天；高巢、王有根、李激涛、王剑魂四人去华北，历时一百零五天。他们共到了二十四省，经过一百七十二个市、县、行程合计十万二千余里。西北远及中苏边境的伊犁和南疆帕米尔高原下中印边境的喀什城，西南直达云南西部中缅边境的龙陵、芒市与红河边上中越交界处的河口市，与东南沿海一带。他们在各地参加欢迎大会及作报告七百二十九次，广播讲演二十八次，举行小型座谈会一百三十次，共计参加各种集会九百零七次。各地人民直接与他们见面并听到报告的有一千零二十五万人，听到广播的三千万人以上，参加欢迎欢送的八百万人。
    志愿军代表每到一地，都有人山人海的群众队伍欢迎，如苏州、西安、昆明、梧州等城市都是十余万人参加欢迎欢送，扬州、芜湖、洛阳、迪化都是十万多人的城市，参加欢迎的人数就有七、八万。农村也是一样。川西各县、苏北沿江地区、广东、福建沿海地区及湘西山区，几乎所有的村庄都有人参加欢迎。
    祖国人民对志愿军代表特别爱戴和关怀。他们每到一地，就受到当地人民热烈的慰问。仅志愿军代表亲手收到的慰劳物品，就有慰问金一百一十九亿元，慰劳信五十余万封，慰劳品二十余万件，慰劳袋十万余个，象征光荣和胜利的鲜花二万余束，还有大批的书籍、报纸和其他珍贵的礼品。志愿军代表在各地所作的传达报告，对各地的抗美援朝运动起了重大的推动作用。代表们临行前曾表示，他们回到前线后，一定把祖国各种建设事业的伟大成绩，土地改革，镇压反革命，各地的优抚工作，以及全国人民热烈捐献飞机大炮和对志愿军热爱与关怀的情形，向全体志愿军同志们作详细的传达。他们同时表示，为了保卫祖国神圣的国土，为了保卫远东和世界和平，他们一定要作不懈的斗争，痛歼更多的美国侵略军，以报答祖国人民的热爱。
        （里若）
   【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若、嵇炳前、高巢等，于离京重返朝鲜前线前，对本社记者发表谈话如下：
    我们志愿军代表在从前线回到祖国来的近半年中，走遍全国各省，到处看到我国人民抗美援朝爱国运动的伟大成就。我们在全国各地的活动是中国人民抗美援朝运动的一部分，我们的活动推动了这一运动更加深入和广泛的开展。我们，作为前后方的桥梁，沟通和密切了志愿军和祖国人民的联系，这就是我们近半年来工作的成绩。
    我们现在要回到朝鲜前线了。敌人正在千方百计阻挠和破坏开城停战谈判，继续坚持其侵略政策。我们回去之后，一定要把全国人民对志愿军的热爱和希望，把祖国建设的伟大成就，深刻地向志愿军部队传达，使志愿军全体同志知道：全国人民是尽最大努力支援我们的，我们一定要守卫着自己的岗位，以更大的力量来打败敢于进犯的敌人，我们一定把自己的全力贡献给争取和平和保卫和平的庄严事业。
    我们曾广泛地接触了全国的抗美援朝运动，在离开祖国之前，我们愿对这一运动的进一步开展提供一点意见：
    （一）抗美援朝运动决不能因现有的成绩而松懈。美帝国主义永远是中国人民的死敌，它永远不会放弃其侵略中国的阴谋。所以我们必须做到人人都来抗美援朝，天天都来抗美援朝。只要敌人还存在，我们就要增强国防力量。
    （二）爱国公约要更加具体化，切合各人、各户、各地的具体情况。捐献运动要依靠增产，不强调掏腰包，不摊派，不妨碍学习。优待烈属军属主要是做好代耕，组织生产和介绍职业，不能单纯依靠救济。
    （三）捐赠给前方的物品，要合乎战士们的实际需要，例如精神食粮方面，可以多捐抗美援朝小册子或连环图画等通俗易懂的书画；慰问信内容要更加实际具体，这样才能更有力地鼓舞战士们；慰劳的物品最好是能够吃或用的东西。
