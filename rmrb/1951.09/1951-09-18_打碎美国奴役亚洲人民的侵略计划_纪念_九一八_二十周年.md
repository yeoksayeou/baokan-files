    Shatter the American Aggressive Plan to Enslave the Asian People
    ——Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident

    Today marks the 20th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. In commemorating the 20th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, we, the Chinese people, are filled with the victorious belief in resisting imperialist aggression; at the same time, we are filled with old and fresh hatred toward American imperialism.
    The Chinese people were the main force in defeating Japanese imperialism. For a long time, the Chinese people fought alone against the Japanese aggressors. In the struggle against Japanese aggression, we paid a huge price in terms of both manpower and material resources to achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the Japanese imperialists launched the war of armed aggression against China on September 18, 1931, the people of Northeast China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, organized the Anti-Japanese United Army and launched a heroic armed struggle.
    On July 7, 1937, Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale war of aggression against China. Under the resolute call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people began the great War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression for National Liberation. After eight years of heroic and arduous struggle, we finally defeated the Japanese aggressors with the assistance of the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to Northeast China. Facts have proved that without the long-term, arduous, and heroic struggle of the Chinese people, Japanese imperialism could not have been defeated, and Japanese aggression could not have been crushed. This great historical contribution of the Chinese people has long been recognized by the world's just public opinion. This also explains why the Chinese people should fully enjoy the indisputable right to speak and decide on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan.
    While the Chinese people were fighting the Japanese aggressors, American imperialism supported Japan's aggression against China. The Chinese people will never forget that American imperialism was an accomplice in Japan's aggression against China. After the "September 18th" Incident, in order to make the Japanese militarists act as the anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people's running dogs in the Far East, American imperialism outwardly professed so-called "non-recognitionism," but in reality adopted a policy of supporting Japan's aggression against China. Until the Pearl Harbor incident on December 8, 1941, many of the military materials used by Japan to invade China were supplied by the United States. For example, in 1938, the war materials the US exported to Japan accounted for 92 percent of Japan's total war consumption. In 1941, the United States even specially lifted the ban on the export of zinc and rubber to Japan. After Japan's surrender, American imperialism completely replaced the position of Japanese imperialism and nakedly became the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and all Asian people. At the same time, it more actively fostered the defeated Japanese aggressive forces in order to turn Japan into its tool for carrying out new wars of aggression in the Far East.
    At present, the United States is stepping up its efforts to revive the Japanese militarist forces. The San Francisco Conference manipulated by the United States brazenly excluded our country and, regardless of the thirteen proposals put forward by Soviet representative Gromyko, brazenly signed the illegal American-made peace treaty with Japan, and at the same time signed the so-called "US-Japan Security Treaty." The US imperialist attempt to oppose China and the Soviet Union and enslave all Asian people has been completely exposed. This is what the Chinese people and all Asian people can never tolerate.
    The American plan for aggression against Asia has long been fully exposed in its war of aggression against Korea. Disregarding our country and the Soviet Union's repeated serious warnings, the United States has continuously expanded its war of aggression against Korea; it has constantly extended the flames of war to the border of Northeast China, vainly attempting to copy the old tricks of the Japanese aggressors and create a second "September 18th." In order to defend their motherland and defend peace in the Far East and the world, the Chinese people formed the People's Volunteers and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, giving the American aggressors continuous and heavy blows, and forcing the United States to accept the Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik's proposal for Korean armistice negotiations. However, the facts since the Kaesong talks have continued to prove that the United States not only has no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, but also shamelessly sabotages the armistice negotiations, creates a "tense situation," coerces its vassal states to sign and stamp the illegal peace treaty with Japan, and continues to carry out war mobilization in its own country.
    The result of American imperialism's reckless death struggle is obviously only to make the United States' position more isolated and dangerous. It has already encountered and is continuing to encounter increasingly serious difficulties; it is encountering increasingly heavy blows from the people who defend peace. The US imperialist plan of aggression can be completely defeated and must be defeated.
    The people of the world, especially the people of Asia, firmly oppose the American-made peace treaty with Japan. This dooms the American-made peace treaty with Japan to failure. The victory of the Chinese people has changed the face of Asia. The new China has now become one of the world's leading powers. What is particularly important is that a powerful China has formed a solid alliance with the world's most powerful Soviet Union with the aim of preventing Japanese aggression. At the same time, the strength of the people of other Asian countries is also growing. Therefore, the future of US imperialism in carrying out wars of aggression will inevitably follow the old path of the demise of Japanese imperialism. The Chinese people are unswervingly continuing to adhere to the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and continue to make greater contributions to the cause of defending the motherland and defending peace in the Far East and the world. We must further unite with all peace-loving countries in the world that oppose US aggression, especially the people of Asia, to defeat the new aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism and smash the US imperialist aggressive plan to enslave the Asian people.

### 打碎美国奴役亚洲人民的侵略计划——纪念“九一八”二十周年

    打碎美国奴役亚洲人民的侵略计划
    ——纪念“九一八”二十周年
    “九一八”事变到今天，整整二十年过去了。在纪念“九一八”二十周年的时候，我们中国人民一面满怀反抗帝国主义侵略的胜利信念；一面对美帝国主义充满着旧恨新仇。
    中国人民是打败日本帝国主义的主要力量。中国人民曾长期和日本侵略者单独作战。在反抗日本侵略的斗争中，我们不论在人力和物力方面都付出了巨大牺牲的代价，才换来了抗日战争的胜利。在日本帝国主义于一九三一年九月十八日发动了武装侵略中国的战争之后，东北人民即在中国共产党的领导下，组织了抗日联军，展开了英勇的武装斗争。
    一九三七年七月七日，日本帝国主义又发动了全面侵略中国的战争。中国人民在中国共产党的坚决号召和领导下，开始了伟大的抗日民族解放战争。经过八年英勇艰苦的奋战，最后在苏联出兵东北的援助下，我们终于打败了日本侵略者。事实证明，如果没有中国人民长期的、艰苦的、英勇的斗争，日本帝国主义就不可能被打败，日本的侵略就不可能被粉碎。中国人民的这个伟大的历史性的贡献，早为世界正义舆论所公认。这也就说明为什么中国人民在对日和约问题上，完全应该享有无可争辩的发言权和决定权。
    当中国人民正在和日本侵略者搏斗的时候，美帝国主义却支持了日本对中国的侵略。中国人民永远不会忘记，美帝国主义是日本侵略中国的帮凶。当“九一八”事变发生以后，美帝国主义为了要使日本军国主义者，充当远东反苏反共反人民的鹰犬，表面上标榜所谓“不承认主义”，实际上却采取了支持日本侵略中国的政策。一直到一九四一年十二月八日珍珠港事件以前，日本用于侵略中国的军火物资，很多都是美国供给的。例如一九三八年美国输日的作战物资，竟占日本全部战争消耗的百分之九十二。到一九四一年，美国还特别解除了锌和橡皮的对日输出禁令。在日本投降以后，美帝国主义即完全代替了日本帝国主义的地位，赤裸裸地变成了中国人民以及全亚洲人民的死敌。同时，它更积极扶植被打败了的日本侵略势力，以便把日本变成它在远东实行新的侵略战争的工具。
    目前，美国正在加紧复活日本军国主义势力。美国所操纵的旧金山会议，竟蛮横地将我国排除在外，并不顾苏联代表葛罗米柯所提出的十三点建议，悍然签订了非法的美制对日和约，同时还签订了所谓“美日安全条约”。美帝国主义企图反对中苏两国和奴役全亚洲人民的罪恶目的，已经完全暴露无遗了。这是中国人民和全亚洲人民所决不能容忍的。
    美国对于亚洲的侵略计划，从它侵略朝鲜的战争中也早已充分地暴露出来了。美国不顾我国和苏联再三严重的警告，不断扩大侵略朝鲜的战争；一直把战争的火焰，燃烧到我国东北边境，妄想抄袭日本侵略者的故技，制造第二个“九一八”。中国人民为了保卫祖国，保卫远东与世界和平，组成了人民志愿军，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，给予美国侵略者以不断的沉重的打击，并迫使美国接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克关于朝鲜停战谈判的建议。但是，开城谈判以来的事实又继续证明，美国不但没有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，并且无耻地破坏停战谈判，制造“紧张的局面”，胁迫其仆从国家在非法的对日和约上签字画押，并继续在它的国内进行战争动员。
    美国帝国主义这样不顾一切地进行垂死挣扎的结果，显然只有使美国的地位更加孤立和危险。它已经并正继续遭遇到愈来愈严重的困难；遭遇到保卫和平的人民给予它的愈来愈沉重的打击。美帝国主义的侵略计划，是完全可以打败的，也是必须打败的。
    全世界人民特别是亚洲人民坚决反对美制的对日和约。这就注定了美制的对日和约是不能生效的。中国人民的胜利，业已改变了亚洲的面貌。新的中国现在已成为世界上头等的强国了。特别重要的是，强大的中国已和世界上最强大的苏联结成了以制止日本侵略为目的的巩固的同盟。同时，亚洲其他各国的人民的力量也日益壮大。因此，美帝国主义进行侵略战争的前途，必然会走上过去日本帝国主义覆灭的老路。中国人民正在毫不动摇地继续坚持抗美援朝的伟大斗争，在保卫祖国、保卫远东与世界和平的事业中，继续做更大的贡献。我们一定要和全世界爱好和平、反对美国侵略的各国人民，特别是亚洲人民进一步团结起来，打败美帝国主义新的侵略阴谋，粉碎美帝国主义奴役亚洲人民的侵略计划。
