Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 24th: All the workers in the workshop of Hao Jianxiu, a fine yarn tender in the state-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to celebrate National Day. The original letter is as follows:

　　Respected Chairman Mao:

　　We have wanted to write to you for a long time. The other day, when we celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival, we thought of you and toasted your health several times. Now, on the occasion of the great National Day, we think of you again. The happiness that the People's Government has brought to our working class in the past two years is beyond words. We deeply know that all this happiness can only be obtained under the leadership of the Communist Party and you – respected Chairman Mao. We miss you, and we can't forget your kindness every moment!

　　Our factory has completely changed since liberation, and all misfortunes and disasters are gone forever. In the past two years, we have gradually enjoyed unprecedented happiness. In our factory, the Trade Union Law has been implemented. We have established our own trade union and elected representatives to participate in factory management. The Labor Insurance Regulations have been implemented, and everyone can enjoy subsidies for birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability. Welfare facilities are improving day by day. Recently, an amateur sanatorium was opened. Hao Jianxiu and Wang Xiuying from our workshop gained significant weight in less than ten days of recuperation. Everyone said, "Who could have imagined this day!" Because we are valued and cared for by the Party and the government, we are welcomed wherever we go. Take Hao Jianxiu's creation of a new record for reducing roller licker waste as an example. Who would have cared about this in the past? But Sister Chen (Comrade Shao Min) personally came from Beijing to encourage her, cultivate her, and convene a fine yarn conference to spread her work method. Hao Jianxiu said, "The fine yarn conference gave me such glory that I will never forget it in my life!" Who can forget that when suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the government even invited us to be "judges"! We put forward many opinions on how to deal with counter-revolutionary elements, and the government accepted them all. We are extremely happy. Isn't this being the masters of our own house? In June of this year, our factory also carried out a democratic reform movement, and all the remnants of feudal foremen were overthrown. It can be said that we no longer suffer anyone's anger, and no one can stop our enthusiasm for work anymore.

　　Respected Chairman Mao! Seeing these things and experiencing them ourselves, we can't help but think of you. We have a proud motherland, and we have such a proud leader! Born in such a country and under your leadership, Chairman Mao, how can everyone not be enthusiastic about working?

　　It should be reported to you that in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the patriotic labor competition we launched is very enthusiastic. Everyone has made some efforts in learning advanced work methods and reducing roller licker waste. So far, all the fine yarn tenders in our workshop have learned the Hao Jianxiu work method. In the past, one person's roller licker waste was no less than three or four pounds a day, and some even produced seven pounds! Now, on average, the roller licker waste is only five or six taels. Hao Jianxiu and Wang Xiuying sometimes only produce one or two taels. In the past, when piecing yarn, four or five inches of recovered silk had to be pulled out, but now only one inch of recovered silk is pulled out to piece it. This reduces the waste of cotton yarn and also reduces defective yarn. In the past, "gourds" and "big bulges" were made by some people five or six a day, but now half a month may not even produce five or six. Chinese cotton is not enough, and wasting a little makes it even more scarce! At the same time as the production competition, we have not forgotten cultural learning at all. One hundred percent of our workshop has participated in cultural learning. Old worker Qiu Lanying, who originally didn't know a single character, can now recognize seventy or eighty characters. Hao Jianxiu, who has been to school for two years, now recognizes thousands of characters. We are working hard to eliminate this shortcoming given to us by the old society.

　　Respected Chairman Mao! We know that all our current happiness is just a starting point, and better days are yet to come! At the same time, we also know that some of the achievements we have made are still far from enough in terms of requiring China to quickly become a socialist country! Especially in the current situation, when U.S. imperialism is arming Japan and is arbitrarily undermining the truce negotiations, we must add more effort to support our dearest people - our hard-working volunteer comrades who are fighting the invaders!

　　We must better learn the Hao Jianxiu work method and reduce the roller licker waste rate even lower. Comrade Hao Jianxiu also plans to learn from veteran workers and from advanced workers in various places to enrich her work method in order to create a new record for reducing roller licker waste. Now, the entire workshop is launching a movement to eliminate defective yarn, and the liaison contract between the front and rear spinning is already signed. We are determined to create good results and win a battle on the production front to repay your kindness to us! Wish you good health!

    郝建秀车间给毛主席写信祝贺国庆
    感谢党和政府带给她们的幸福生活和民主权利
    决心更好地学习郝建秀工作法再降低皮辊花率
    【新华社青岛二十四日电】国营青岛第六棉纺织厂细纱值车工郝建秀所在车间的全体工人写信给毛主席祝贺国庆。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们老早就想写信给您了。前两天在欢度中秋节时，我们便想起了您，曾为您的健康干了好几杯。现在逢到伟大的国庆节，我们又想起了您。两年来人民政府给我们工人阶级带来的幸福是说也说不完的，我们深知道这些幸福都是在共产党与您——敬爱的毛主席的领导下才能够得到的。我们想念着您，我们时时刻刻忘不了您的恩情！
    我们这个厂自从解放后便完全变了样，一切不幸和灾难都一去不复返了。两年来，我们逐步地享受着前所未有的幸福。在我们厂里，工会法实行了，我们成立了自己的工会，并选出代表参加工厂管理；劳动保险条例实行了，大家都能享受到关于生、老、病、死、伤、残等事件的补助待遇；福利设施一天天改进，最近又开办了业余休养所。我们车间的郝建秀、王秀英同志进去休养不到十天，体重便有显著的增加。大家都说：“谁能想到有这一天！”由于我们受到党和政府的重视和爱护，我们走到那里，那里也欢迎。就拿郝建秀创造少出皮辊花的新纪录来说，在早谁瞧得起这一套，而陈大姐
    （少敏同志）听说了，便亲自从北京跑来鼓励她、培养她，召开细纱会议传播她的工作法。郝建秀说：“细纱会议给我的光荣，我一辈子也忘不了！”我们谁又能忘得了镇压反革命时，政府还邀请我们当“法官”呢！我们提出很多处理反革命分子的意见，政府都接受了。我们高兴极了，这不是当家做主人，这是什么呢？今年六月间，我们厂里又进行了民主改革运动，所有的封建把头残余分子都打倒了。可以说到现在是任谁的气我们都不受了，再也没有人能拦挡我们干活的劲头了。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们眼看着这些，身受着这些，便不由得想起了您。我们有一个值得骄傲的祖国，我们又有一个多么值得骄傲的领袖啊！生在这样的祖国，在毛主席您的领导下，大家干活怎能不起劲呢？
    应该向您报告，在抗美援朝运动中，我们开展的爱国主义劳动竞赛是很热烈的。大家都在学习先进工作法、少出皮辊花方面做了些努力。到现在为止，我们车间的细纱看车工全部都学会郝建秀工作法了。在早那一个人皮辊花一天不出三、四磅，有的还出到七磅呢！现在扯平的说，皮辊花只出五、六两了，郝建秀及王秀英她们有时只出到一、二两。过去接头时要掏去四、五寸长的回丝，现在掏去一寸多长的回丝就接上了头。这就减少了棉纱的浪费，也减少了坏纱。过去“亚葫芦”“大凸肚”，有的人一天出五、六个，现在半个月也不一定出五、六个。中国棉花还不大够用，浪费一点便更缺一点啊！和生产竞赛同时，我们一点也没忘了文化学习。我们全车间已经百分之百地参加了文化学习。老工友仇兰英原先一个字不识，现在已能识七八十个字。郝建秀由于上过两年学，现在更识到成千的字了。我们正为消灭旧社会所给予我们的这个缺欠而努力。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们知道我们现在的一切幸福只是一个起点，好日子还在后头呢！同时我们也知道我们现在所干的一些成绩，在要求中国很快地成为一个社会主义国家这一点上来说，还是很不够的呢！尤其在目前的情况下，美帝国主义正在武装日本，正在蛮横无理地破坏停战谈判，我们必须加上一把劲来支援我们最亲爱的人——我们坚苦的打击侵略者的志愿军同志！
    我们一定要更好地学习郝建秀工作法，把皮辊花率降得更低。郝建秀同志也打算向老工人学习，向各地先进工作者学习，来充实她的工作法，以创造少出皮辊花的更新的纪录。现在全车间正展开消灭坏纱运动，前后纺的联系合同已经订出了。我们决心创造一个好的成绩，在生产战线上打它一个胜仗，以报答您对我们的恩情！祝您身体健康！
