Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Soviet writer Ehrenburg and the Chilean poet Neruda attended a symposium held by the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles this afternoon and met with Chinese writers. The symposium was presided over by Mao Dun and Zhou Yang, vice-chairmen of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. 150 writers, cultural and artistic workers attended. Ehrenburg and Neruda introduced their creative experiences at the meeting and gave many valuable opinions on the tasks of writers and the training of young writers. The symposium lasted for two hours, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly held a lecture meeting in Beijing this morning to welcome the Chilean poet and outstanding peace fighter, Mr. Neruda. More than 800 people were invited to attend.

Neruda delivered a speech at the meeting entitled "The Latin American People's Struggle for Independence and Peace." Neruda briefly and vividly introduced the history of the Latin American people's suffering from foreign invasions, first by the Spanish and later by the Americans, and the people's heroic and unyielding struggle against the invaders.

Neruda said: Although Latin America has abundant resources, under the rule of American imperialism, the people live in extreme poverty and misery. He said: The Latin American people have never stopped their struggle against the American fascist rulers, and their struggle is to achieve the victory that the Chinese people have already achieved. He cited many examples of American imperialist armed aggression against Latin America and said that the barbarity of the methods used was the same as that shown in Korea.

Neruda pointed out that, regardless of the brutal suppression by American imperialism and its Latin American puppets, the people are carrying out a persistent struggle for liberation. He especially introduced the heroic struggle of the Chilean people under the leadership of the Chilean Communist Party, which is persisting in its underground struggle.

Neruda said that although the rulers of Latin America have signed various agreements with Washington and the United States, the people are opposed to these agreements.

Neruda finally emphasized the fraternal relationship between the Latin American people and the Chinese people. He said: The Latin American people are very familiar with the Chinese people, and our people do not believe any of the imperialists' slanders against the Chinese people. He said that the Chinese people are supported by hundreds of millions of people all over the world, and the success of the Chinese people is also the success of the Latin American people and the people all over the world. The struggle of the Chinese people is closely linked with the struggle of the people of all countries in the world, and this connection will be further strengthened in the future to build human peace and a better life.

    【新华社十九日讯】苏联作家爱伦堡和智利诗人聂鲁达今日下午出席了中华全国文学艺术界联合会举行的座谈会，和中国作家晤面。座谈会由中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾、周扬主持，到会的作家、文化艺术工作者有一百五十人。爱伦堡和聂鲁达在会上介绍了他们的创作经验，并就作家的任务与培养青年作家等问题发表了许多宝贵的意见。座谈会历时二小时，空气极为欢洽。

    聂鲁达在会上发表演讲，题目是“拉丁美洲人民为独立与和平而斗争”。聂鲁达简略而生动地介绍了拉丁美洲人民遭受外来的、先是西班牙人、后来是美国人的侵略及人民对侵略者英勇不屈的斗争的历史。
    聂鲁达说：拉丁美洲虽然有着丰富的资源，但在美帝国主义统治下，人民却过着十分贫困悲惨的生活。他说：拉丁美洲人民从未停止过反对美国法西斯统治者的斗争，他们的斗争是要达到像中国人民所已取得的胜利。他举出了美帝国主义武装侵略拉丁美洲的许多例子，并说他所用手段之野蛮，就像在朝鲜所表现的一样。
    聂鲁达指出，不顾美帝国主义及其拉丁美洲傀儡们的凶暴镇压，人民却进行着坚持不渝的解放斗争。他特别介绍了智利人民在坚持地下斗争的智利共产党的领导之下所进行的英勇斗争。
    聂鲁达说，尽管拉丁美洲的统治者在华盛顿和美国签订种种协定，但人民是反对这些协定的。
    聂鲁达最后强调拉丁美洲人民与中国人民的兄弟般的关系。他说：拉丁美洲人民很熟悉中国人民，我们的人民不相信帝国主义者诬蔑中国人民的任何一句话。他说中国人民受到全世界亿万人民的支持，中国人民的成功也是拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民的成功。中国人民的斗争是和全世界各国人民的斗争紧紧联系在一起的，今后这种联系将更益加强，以建立人类和平与美好的生活。
