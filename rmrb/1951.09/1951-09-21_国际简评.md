International Brief Commentary

"The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!"

The notorious North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting has begun in Ottawa, Canada. This is a meeting where the United States intends to further oppress its Western European vassal states to strengthen their arms expansion and war preparations.

At the recently held Washington Three Foreign Ministers' meeting, the United States forced Britain and France to accept its plan to arm West Germany. At this Ottawa meeting, Acheson is again pressing those North Atlantic Treaty vassal states to step up their war preparations. The desperate eagerness of the United States to force its vassal states to accelerate towards war is exceptionally evident here.

But things are not so wonderful. The economic burden of rearmament and the resulting inflationary pressures have made the vassal states of the United States feel very heavy. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gaitskell stated at the Ottawa meeting: "British prices are rising, raw materials are scarce, and the economic situation is not good," and "Under the current circumstances, it is impossible to accelerate or expand the military buildup plan." Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson further "emphasized the danger that world-wide (referring to the capitalist world) inflation may hinder the coordinated defense efforts of the twelve member states," so "rumors of the devaluation of the pound are spreading universally" around the world.

These facts illustrate a truth: Rearmament and war preparations will not only fail to allow capitalist countries to escape their economic predicament, but will instead make the lives of the people at home increasingly impoverished, arousing greater dissatisfaction and resistance among the people against the government. Therefore, the result of the United States pushing its vassal states to accelerate their war preparations will inevitably accelerate the economic and political crises of the entire imperialist bloc. Isn't this already very obvious?

The Evil Consequences of the Labour Party's Arms Expansion and War Preparations

Since September 10, the standard of rations for certain foods in Britain has been reduced again. The weekly cheese ration per person has been reduced from two ounces to one and a half ounces, and butter from four ounces to two ounces. At the same time, an informal milk rationing system has been implemented. Therefore, almost all dairy farms have limited the supply of milk. According to the "Daily Mail", poor families are unable to buy the full meat ration of two shillings per person per week. From September 16, the bacon ration standard was reduced from four ounces to three ounces, and the price of the weekly meat ration increased to two shillings and two pence. In this way, the condition of the broad masses of residents will further deteriorate. The situation of the disabled, the elderly, and welfare recipients is particularly bad. Pensions are far from sufficient to cover the minimum expenses.

The continuous soaring of prices in Britain and the increasing impoverishment of the working people is the inevitable consequence of the British reactionary ruling group following the US imperialism's arms expansion and war preparations, causing inflation. The British people understand this truth. Therefore, if the British people want to prevent their lives from continuing to deteriorate, they must unite and wage a resolute struggle against the Labour government, oppose the Labour Party's arms expansion and war preparation policies, and strive for national independence, peace, and the right to survival.

    国际简评
    “心有余而力不足”！
    臭名昭著的北大西洋公约理事会会议，已在加拿大的渥太华开始举行了。这是美国要进一步压迫其西欧仆从国家加强整军备战的会议。
    在刚刚举行过的华盛顿三外长会议上，美国强迫着英法接受了它武装西德的计划；在这次渥太华会议上，艾奇逊又催逼那些北大西洋公约的仆从国家加紧进行备战。美国穷凶极恶地逼迫它的仆从国家加速走向战争的那种迫不及待的心情，在这里已暴露得异常明显了。
    但是事情并不是那样美妙的。重整军备的经济负担以及由此而引起的通货膨胀的压力，已使得美国的仆从国家感到十分的沉重。英国财政大臣贾兹克尔在渥太华会议上表示：“英国物价上涨，原料缺乏，经济状况不佳”，“在目前情况下，无法加速进行或扩大军备计划”。加拿大外长皮尔逊更在会议上，“着重指出这样的危险，即世界范围（按指资本主义世界）的通货膨胀可能阻挠十二个会员国的配合一致的防御努力”，因此“全世界普遍流传”着“英镑将贬值的谣言”。
    这些事实，说明了一个真理：整军备战不但不能使资本主义国家逃脱它们的经济困窘状况，反而将使国内人民的生活日益贫困，而引起人民对政府的更加不满和反抗。因此，美国催逼其仆从国家加速进行备战的结果，必将加速造成整个帝国主义集团的经济危机和政治危机，这不是已经很明显了吗？
    工党扩军备战带来的恶果
    自从九月十日以来，英国若干食品配给的标准再度减少。每周每人干酪的配给量从两盎斯减到一盎斯半，黄油从四盎斯减到二盎斯。同时，实行了非正式的牛奶配给制。因此，几乎所有的乳场都限制了牛奶的供应。据《每日邮报》报道，贫穷人家无力全部购买每人每周价值两先令的配给肉量。从九月十六日起，咸肉配给标准从四盎斯减少到三盎斯，每周肉类配给量的价格提高到二先令二便士。这样，广大居民阶层的状况将更加恶化。残废者、老年人与扶助金受领人的处境尤其糟糕。养老金远不敷最低限度的开支。
    英国物价不断飞涨，劳动人民生活一天比一天贫困，是英国反动统治集团追随美帝国主义扩军备战，引起通货膨胀的必然恶果。英国人民是懂得这个道理的。因此，英国人民要使自己的生活不继续恶化下去，只有团结起来，向工党政府进行坚决地斗争，反对工党的扩军备战政策，争取国家的独立、和平和生存权利。
