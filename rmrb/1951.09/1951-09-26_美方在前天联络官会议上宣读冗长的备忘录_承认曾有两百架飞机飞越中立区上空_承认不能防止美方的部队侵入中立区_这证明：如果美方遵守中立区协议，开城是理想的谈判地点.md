Title: The US side read out a lengthy memorandum at the liaison officers' meeting the day before yesterday, admitting that 200 planes had flown over the neutral zone, admitting that it could not prevent US troops from invading the neutral zone. This proves that Kaesong is an ideal negotiating location if the US side abides by the neutral zone agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London Daily Worker, reported from Kaesong on the 24th: At the liaison officers' meeting this morning, the US side prevented discussion of the time and date for resuming ceasefire negotiations. They put forward the demand that the “conditions” for resuming negotiations should be discussed first in order to obstruct. The main condition they put forward was to change the meeting location, although there is no doubt that they must have many other conditions in their bulging briefcases. Kenny, the most cunning chief liaison officer of the US side, put forward extraordinary arguments in a lengthy memorandum. He admitted that 200 planes had flown over the neutral zone and admitted that he could not prevent Ridgway's troops from invading the neutral zone—all of which Ridgway had vehemently denied—attempting to prove in this way that Kaesong "inevitably" could not be used as a negotiating location. This startling document only proves one point: that Kaesong is an ideal location if the United States abides by the neutral zone agreement. As Kenny was reading this nonsense-filled document, several small teams of American jets were screeching over the meeting location.

    美方在前天联络官会议上宣读冗长的备忘录
    承认曾有两百架飞机飞越中立区上空
    承认不能防止美方的部队侵入中立区
    这证明：如果美方遵守中立区协议，开城是理想的谈判地点
    【新华社二十五日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十四日自开城报道：在今日上午联络官会议上，美方不让讨论恢复停火谈判的时间与日期。他们提出应该首先讨论恢复谈判的“条件”这种要求来进行阻挠。他们提出的主要条件是更换开会地址，虽然没有疑问，他们满满的皮包中一定还有许多其他的条件。美方最狡猾的首席联络官肯尼在冗长的备忘录中，提出了异乎寻常的论据。他承认曾有两百架飞机飞越中立区上空，并承认不能防止李奇微手下的军队侵入中立区——这些都是李奇微所矢口否认的事情——企图这样来证明开城“不可避免地”不能用作谈判地点。这个令人吃惊的文件只证明了一个问题，就是如果美国遵守中立区协议，开城是一个理想的地点。当肯尼在宣读这个满篇废话的文件时，有几小队美国喷气机正尖声地飞过会议地点的上空。
