Response to readers' criticisms and suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor,
    We believe that the criticism made by Comrade Liu Zhenyu in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on July 29 regarding the mistakes made by our province's work team in some villages in the first district of Datong County is correct. In some areas of our province, due to insufficient understanding of the political significance of substitute farming by leading cadres, and neglecting patriotic education on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs among the masses, there has been an emphasis on the improvement of the substitute farming system, resulting in the practice of absolute egalitarianism in the burden of substitute farming, or a tendency towards village-level egoism. These situations have already drawn our attention. In addition to instructing all counties to correct them, we are further studying how to do a good job in substitute farming.
                                The Civil Affairs Department of the People's Government of Chahar Province

### 察哈尔省人民政府纠正某些地区代耕工作中绝对平均主义的偏向

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    察哈尔省人民政府纠正某些地区代耕工作中绝对平均主义的偏向编辑同志：
    七月二十九日刘振宇同志在人民日报“读者来信”栏，对我省工作组在大同县一区某些村庄工作时所犯错误提出的批评，我们认为是正确的。我省某些地区，由于领导干部对代耕的政治意义认识不足，忽视了对群众进行拥军优属的爱国主义教育，而偏重了代耕制度的改进，发生了对代耕负担的绝对平均主义作法，或村本位主义的偏向。这些情况，已引起我们的注意。我们除已指示各县进行纠正外，并正进一步研究如何做好代耕工作。
