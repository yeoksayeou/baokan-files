    [This Newspaper Despatch] On the afternoon of August 31st, at 3:00 PM, the Northeast Bureau convened a meeting of two thousand cadres from various directly subordinate organs, with the main responsible comrades from various provinces and cities also attending. At the meeting, Comrade Gao Gang made a very important report. He profoundly and sharply criticized the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucratic styles of work. Comrade Gao Gang emphatically pointed out: These bad tendencies are manifestations of the reactionary ideology of the bourgeoisie infiltrating the fighting Communist Party. If we do not overcome these bad tendencies, we will become divorced from the masses, and the revolutionary cause will not be able to advance, nor will we be able to consolidate the victory of the revolution. Our Party is glorious, great, and correct, and the vast majority of comrades are wholeheartedly serving the people. We absolutely cannot tolerate the existence of corruption, waste, and bureaucratic styles of work. These tendencies are our enemies, and we must eliminate them. Finally, Comrade Gao Gang called: A struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy should be launched in all organs and departments in the Northeast. It is necessary to give full play to democracy, and widely launch a movement to expose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, so that any degenerates will have nowhere to hide. Those degenerates who are exposed must be seriously dealt with, and no leniency or accommodation should be allowed. Responsible comrades of all organs and departments must have a firm attitude, personally take charge, and lead the movement thoroughly from beginning to end, and not allow it to be abandoned halfway. Only in this way can we foster righteousness, promote righteousness, rescue a group of cadres who have already fallen or are about to fall into the mire, and constantly lead the people's revolutionary cause forward. Comrade Gao Gang's report lasted three hours. The Northeast Bureau notified all organs and departments to immediately disseminate Comrade Gao Gang's report, and combine it with Party rectification education to organize all staff to study it, and conduct in-depth inspections of the work of their own units. According to the Northeast Daily, on September 3rd, the Beiling Organ Party Committee of the Northeast People's Government held an expanded meeting of the Party Committee to discuss and disseminate Comrade Gao Gang's report, and made arrangements to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and held a general meeting of all Party members of various departments on the 6th to mobilize them. The Trade Department and the Finance Department of the Northeast People's Government, as well as the various specialized companies under the Trade Department and the various bureaus under the Finance Department, have now launched a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In order to help its subordinate units carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the Finance Department has specially extracted thirty cadres to form an inspection team to go deep into various units to collect materials with emphasis.
