(Xinhua News Agency) Ninety-seven family members of victims who died from plague bacteria spread by Japanese invaders in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, eleven years ago, recently jointly wrote a letter to Gromyko, head of the Soviet delegation to the San Francisco Conference, accusing the Japanese bacterial warfare criminals of their bloody crimes and resolutely opposing US imperialism's illegal unilateral peace treaty with Japan. The letter stated in brief: We express our greatest indignation at the US imperialist's criminal activities in unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan. We cannot help but recall the blood case created eleven years ago when Japanese planes dropped plague bacilli over Ningbo, we cannot forget that our parents, wives, and children were killed by the Japanese invaders, so we absolutely cannot tolerate the US imperialists still sheltering those murderers and rearming them.

On October 28, 1940, Japanese planes dropped a large number of wheat, flour, millet and other items containing fleas at the intersection of Kaiming Street in Ningbo City. After these grains fell to the ground, many fleas spread in all directions. The next day, Mei You, a vendor on Kaiming Street, died of the plague, and then the plague spread rapidly, with large numbers of people dying. A total of 117 people in the city were killed by Japanese plague bacteria.

    宁波受难者家属致书葛罗米柯
    控诉日寇罪行反对美国片面对日媾和
    【新华社讯】十一年前日寇曾在浙江省宁波市散布鼠疫菌，因传染疫菌而死难者的家属九十七人，最近联名写信给参加旧金山会议的苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯，控诉日寇细菌战犯的血腥罪行，坚决反对美帝国主义非法片面对日媾和。该信略称：我们对美帝国主义片面对日媾和的罪恶活动，表示最大的愤怒。我们不能不想起十一年前日本飞机在宁波上空撒放鼠疫杆菌而制造的血案，我们不能忘记我们的父母、妻子和儿女是被日寇杀死的，所以我们绝不能容忍美帝国主义至今还包庇着那些杀人的凶手，并且正在重新武装那些凶手。
    一九四○年十月二十八日，日本飞机在宁波市开明街口撒下大批内藏跳蚤的麦子、面粉和粟等物品，这些粮食落地以后，许多跳蚤便向四处散布。第二天，开明街上的小贩梅友便染鼠疫而死，接着鼠疫迅速蔓延，人们大批的死亡。总计全市被日寇鼠疫菌杀死的有一百一十七人之多。
