    Fan Jieliang, Factory Director of a Factory in Benxi,
    Does Not Care About Workers' Health At All

    Comrade Editor:
    The following serious problems urgently need to be solved in the area of labor protection at a factory in Benxi: (1) The problem of working overtime. Workers in the electrical repair group of a certain workshop have to work a night shift every three days on average; the overtime hours are sometimes three or four hours, sometimes all night. Worker Sun Deyu worked a total of 19.5 work hours of overtime in June. This violates government decrees and seriously affects the health of employees. (2) All sixteen rest rooms in the factory need to be tidied up; four rest rooms in one location leak rain; the straw mats on the sleeping platforms are tattered and not replaced for a long time; the rooms are also very dark; as a result, workers do not get adequate rest, which affects production. (3) In the raw materials group of a certain workshop, the workers pushing carts do not have fixed meal times, and a meal has to be eaten in several installments, either while pushing the cart or eating a little after pushing a cart, which causes workers to commonly suffer from stomach problems. (4) The factory's toilets do not have a cleaning system, and some toilets are too dirty. (5) A quarter of the workers in the factory receive health care subsidies, but there is no health care cafeteria, so the workers spend the health care money.

    The above problems have existed for at least half a year. In order to solve these problems, I have approached Factory Director Fan Jieliang of the factory seven times, but there has been no improvement. The first time, Factory Director Fan said: "Solve it gradually, but you should also educate the workers to raise their awareness." The second time, he said: "I don't have time, talk to the technical office if you have something." The third time, he simply refused to see me and said to submit any opinions in writing; afterwards, he also said that I was trying to "nitpick" him. The fourth time, I submitted a written opinion, but he said: "We are currently busy with production, we'll talk about it later." The fifth time, he said: "I have already sent someone to investigate, I will reply in a week." The sixth time, he said impatiently: "Do you think it's slow? I think the time is too short!" The seventh time, he lost his temper and said: "As for that problem, you just wait!" When I pressed him further, he said: "I am just like this, if you can, go complain to the company, or send me to court, or have me removed from my post."

    The existence of such problems in the factory, with the factory director not only failing to take the initiative to study and solve them, but also passively resisting, is very wrong in my opinion. Is it permissible for the director of a factory not to care about the health of the workers? I demand that he make a public self-criticism in the Party newspaper.

### 本溪某工厂厂长范杰良  根本不关心工人的健康问题

    本溪某工厂厂长范杰良
    根本不关心工人的健康问题编辑同志：
    本溪某工厂在劳动保护方面存在着以下几个急待解决的严重问题：（一）加班加点问题。某车间电气检修组工人，平均每人每隔三天要加一个夜班；加班时间，有时三、四小时，有时通夜。工人孙德玉在六月份共加班十九个半工。这就违犯了政府的法令，严重地影响了职工身体健康。（二）全厂十六个休息室都需要整理；某处四个休息室都漏雨；炕席破烂，长时不换；室内又很黑；因此工人得不到适当的休息，影响了生产。（三）某车间原料组，推车工人没有固定的吃饭时间，一顿饭要分几次吃，或是一边推一边吃，或是推一车吃一点，以致工人普遍患有胃病。（四）全厂厕所没有清扫制度，有些厕所太脏。（五）全厂有四分之一的工人享受保健津贴，但没有设立保健食堂，工人就将保健费花掉了。
    以上这些问题，至少都已存在半年以上。为了解决这些问题，我前后曾找过该厂范杰良厂长七次，结果仍没有改进。第一次，范厂长说：“逐渐解决，但你们也应教育工人提高觉悟。”第二次，他说：“没时间，有事找技术室谈。”第三次，他就闭门不见了，并说有意见请书面提；事后他还说我是找他的“蹩扭”。第四次，我提了书面意见，但他说：“我们现在忙于生产，以后再说。”第五次，他说：“我已经派人了解，过一星期后再答复。”第六次，他不耐烦地说：“你们嫌慢了吗？我还嫌时间短呢！”第七次，他却大发脾气地说：“那个问题，你们还是等着吧！”再追下去，他说：“我就是这样，你有办法到公司告状去，或送我到法院，或撤了我的职。”
    该厂存在这样问题，厂长既不主动研究解决，反而消极抗拒，我认为这是很错误的。作为一个工厂的厂长，而不关心工人的健康，这难道是可以容许的吗？我要求他在党报上作公开检讨。
