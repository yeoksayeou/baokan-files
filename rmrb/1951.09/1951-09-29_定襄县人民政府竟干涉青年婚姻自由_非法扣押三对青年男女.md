The Dingxiang County People's Government in Shanxi Province has detained young men and women seeking freedom of marriage, which is a serious error that violates freedom of marriage and infringes upon human rights.

    Bo Fenglian (18 years old), a woman from Fanglan Village, Third District of the county, was voluntarily engaged to Shi Sanqing (20 years old) from Qingshi Village last year. In the first month of this year, Bo Fenglian's mother arranged everything and betrothed Fenglian to Liang Cunhe, a cadre of the county granary, receiving 65 silver dollars as betrothal gifts. Fenglian was unwilling and determined to marry Shi Sanqing. On May 24th, Fenglian went to the District Government to request a divorce from Liang Cunhe, but it was not approved. On her way home, Fenglian met Shi Sanqing, and the two agreed to go to the County People's Government together on the third day to process the divorce from Liang Cunhe. Fenglian returned to the village and told another woman, Bo Xiumei, about this plan. Bo Xiumei also had a lover in Qingshi Village, a young man named Wu Quantong. However, she had been betrothed since childhood by her parents, and she was worried about this every day. Therefore, they decided that the four of them would take the train to the county together to apply for divorce. However, they were "caught" by railway police on the train and sent to the District People's Government. The District People's Government, on the grounds of "adultery and abduction," sent the four to the county for "legal action." The letter sending the "case" stated: "...These two men are disrupting social order, and the masses hate them extremely; these two women behave poorly and wander the streets every day." The County People's Government did not investigate the situation and detained the four.

    In addition, Zhao Jincan, an 18-year-old woman from Zhen'anzhai Village, First District of the county, had been in love with Fan Jinkui, a young man from the same village, since February last year. Jincan's parents were backward-thinking and opposed their daughter's freedom of love. In October last year, they forced Jincan to marry Peng Jiangsheng (15 years old) from Nanzuo Village. Jincan was beaten by her parents for opposing arranged marriage, and her parents did not allow her to return to her mother's home. In June of this year, Jincan prepared to file for divorce with the District Government, but her mother-in-law discovered it and falsely accused Jincan and Jinkui to the District Government first. The First District People's Government, without investigation or research, transferred Jincan and Jinkui to the County People's Government and detained them.

    After the incident, some cadres in the county still have a unclear understanding of these errors, saying that "there are too many love cases." This fully exposes how serious the feudal ideology of these cadres, even the responsible cadres of the county, is! The feudal ideology of cadres is a stumbling block to the correct implementation of the Marriage Law and the realization of freedom of marriage for men and women. The cadres involved in the above three incidents should make a profound self-criticism.

### 定襄县人民政府竟干涉青年婚姻自由  非法扣押三对青年男女

    定襄县人民政府
    竟干涉青年婚姻自由
    非法扣押三对青年男女
    山西省定襄县人民政府扣押要求婚姻自由的青年男女，是违反婚姻自由、侵犯人权的严重错误行为。
    该县三区芳兰村妇女薄凤莲（十八岁），去年和青石村师三青（二十岁）自愿订婚。今年正月，薄凤莲的母亲一手包办，把凤莲许给了本县粮库干部梁存和，要了六十五个白洋的聘礼。凤莲不愿意，决心要和师三青结婚。五月二十四日，凤莲跑到区政府要求与梁存和退婚，没被批准。回家的路上，凤莲碰见了师三青，两人约定第三天一起到县人民政府办理与梁存和退婚的手续。凤莲回到村里，把这个计划告诉了另一个妇女薄秀梅。薄秀梅在青石村也有一个爱人——青年武全通。但她从小就被父母包办订了婚，整天为此愁眉不展。于是，她们便决定四人一起乘火车去县办理退婚手续。她（他）们在火车上却被铁路警察“查住”，并被送到区人民政府。区人民政府以“通奸拐带”的罪名，将四人送县“法办”。在送“案”信上写着：“……该二男人，捣乱社会治安，群众痛恨之极；该二女人，素日行为不好，每天大街游窜。”对此，县人民政府并未问明情况，便将四人扣押起来。
    另，该县一区镇安寨村妇女赵金蝉，今年十八岁，从去年二月间便与本村青年樊金魁恋爱。金蝉的父母思想落后，反对女儿自由恋爱，于去年十月间强迫金蝉与南作村彭降生（十五岁）结婚。金蝉因为反对父母包办婚姻，挨了父母的打，父母还不准她回娘家。今年六月，金蝉准备向区政府提出离婚要求，不料被婆婆发觉，先到区政府诬告了金蝉和金魁。第一区区人民政府未经调查研究，便将金蝉、金魁转送县人民政府，扣押了起来。
    事情发生之后，该县部分干部对于这些错误还认识不清，说什么“花案太多了”。这充分暴露了这些干部甚至该县负责干部的封建思想是多么严重！干部的封建思想是正确贯彻婚姻法、实现男女婚姻自由的绊脚石，与上述三事有关的干部应作深刻检讨。
