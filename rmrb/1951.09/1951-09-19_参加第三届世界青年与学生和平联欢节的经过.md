The Deep Friendship of Young People Around the World for Chinese Youth

The festival is also a melting pot for young people from various countries to enhance genuine friendship and mutual understanding. It was not just young people from various countries enthusiastically shouting "Friendship!" to each other on crowded streets, shaking hands, embracing, signing autographs, and exchanging gifts and badges. Moreover, youth representatives from various countries held many large and small gatherings in Berlin. Soviet youth and American youth sang "The World Democratic Youth March" together. Raymonda Dien, a famous French peace fighter (only twenty years old, who was arrested and sentenced for lying on the tracks to prevent trains from transporting ammunition to Vietnam), and a combat hero of the Vietnamese People's Army who lost his right hand embraced each other. Korean youth fraternized with peace-loving youth from the United States, Britain, and Canada.

Chinese youth, due to their achievements in the cause of defending peace, gave great encouragement to youth from various countries and won the love and respect of peace-loving youth from all over the world. On their way to Berlin, the Chinese youth delegation received a grand welcome and extremely warm hospitality from Soviet youth. We should express our sincere gratitude to our Soviet youth friends and the Lenin-Stalin Communist Youth League for their help.

During the festival, to further strengthen the friendship between Chinese youth and youth from various countries, the Chinese youth delegation held six large gatherings, inviting youth representatives from twenty-two countries in Europe, America, and Australia, youth representatives from various Asian countries, youth representatives from twenty-six countries in Latin America and Africa, youth representatives from Eastern European people's democratic countries, German youth representatives, and the Soviet youth delegation to participate in the gatherings.

These enthusiastic friendly gatherings achieved a profound effect in enhancing mutual understanding. American youth called this gathering with Chinese youth representatives "historically significant." They said that although American youth were forced to fight Chinese youth in Korea, the gathering showed the common will of Chinese and American youth to defend peace. Kim Su-jin, the head of the Korean youth delegation, thanked the Chinese people and Chinese youth for their assistance to the Korean people. Vietnamese youth representatives emphasized that the struggle of Chinese youth was a good example for Vietnamese youth. The Indian representative thanked the Soviet and Chinese people for helping them relieve the famine with food. They said: "The fighting path of the Chinese people is like a lighthouse, inspiring the Indian people." The representative of West Africa said that the West African people regard Mao Zedong as a beacon for their national independence. The combat heroes among the Chinese youth representatives were warmly welcomed by youth from various countries. At the gathering with Soviet youth representatives, the Chinese youth representatives particularly expressed their sincere desire to take Soviet youth as their role models and learn from the Soviet Lenin-Stalin Communist Youth League.

At these gatherings, Chinese youth presented many gifts to youth from various countries and performed wonderful artistic programs. At each gathering, the names "Stalin" and "Mao Zedong" aroused prolonged applause and cheers. After each gathering, everyone shook hands and embraced, reluctant to part. Many young people were moved to tears when parting.

It is particularly worth mentioning the deep friendship between Chinese and German youth. To welcome the festival, German youth decorated Lenin Avenue in Berlin as "China Street." This street not only had huge five-star red flags and portraits of Chairman Mao, but also many Chinese slogans and Chinese pictures. The displays in the windows also featured many ancient and modern Chinese crafts and works of art. After the Chinese youth delegation arrived in Berlin, dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of German youth came to our residence almost every day to fraternize, performing artistic programs and exchanging gifts with each other. Chinese youth had extremely enthusiastic gatherings with German youth, people's police, and Young Pioneers, and were also invited to the headquarters of the Free German Youth League for a gathering. Comrade Feng Wenbin, on behalf of Chinese youth, presented a flag of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to German youth. When accepting the flag, Onnecker, chairman of the Free German Youth League, said: "Let this victorious flag bring the victory of the Chinese people to the German people!"

Chinese youth representatives warmly consoled the German youth who were injured by the West German police in West Berlin on August 15, and issued a stern protest to the West German reactionaries. This attack was the most shameless atrocity of American imperialism and West German reactionaries. The reactionaries advertised every day inviting the youth participating in the festival to visit West Berlin, but when 100,000 German youth entered West Berlin to discuss common issues of defending peace, they were attacked with batons and water cannons, injuring more than 400 youth, and hundreds were missing and arrested. Kush, a representative of the headquarters of the Free German Youth League, said: "When German youth were attacked by American police in West Berlin while striving for a peaceful gathering, they thought of Chinese youth and the fighting path of Chinese youth."

Chinese youth received countless gifts, including flags, books, newspapers, and photos, as well as various machine models, instruments, artworks, glass, porcelain, telescopes, cameras, stationery, and musical instruments. Workers from the Bavarian automobile factory personally drove a new ambulance to the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Zeiss optical factory presented Chinese youth with a set of astronomical instruments. These are all expressions of extremely deep friendship.

To thank the German people for their warm hospitality, Comrade Feng Wenbin, the head of the Chinese youth delegation, presented gifts to President Pieck and Prime Minister Grotewohl on behalf of the Chinese youth, and also presented gifts to the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party.

Chinese Youth's Artistic Performances Received Lofty Honors

Cultural and artistic and sports activities are another major component of the festival. Young people from seventy-eight countries participated in the performance programs, with a total of more than 350 performances. The total number of audience members for the artistic programs exceeded 1.6 million, and the audience for the films exceeded 690,000.

Young friends from all over the world learn from each other's artistic creations, which is not only a large-scale cultural exchange, but also greatly helps the understanding between various nationalities, powerfully eliminating the artificial barriers established by the reactionaries between the youth of various countries, thus greatly benefiting the cause of peace. Moreover, cultural and sports activities have proven to be a powerful way to attract a wider range of young people to participate in the struggle for peace.

The Soviet artistic programs fully demonstrated that the socialist system is the system that can best unleash the talents and wisdom of young people. The fighting Korea and Vietnam also performed programs that inspired the people to strive for national independence. Defending peace is the central theme of programs from various countries.

The Chinese Youth Art Troupe prepared a rich program for the festival. The program included operas ("The White-Haired Girl," "Dong Cunrui," and "Marching Side by Side"), Peking Opera ("New Crossroads," "Wu Song Fights the Tiger"), choruses ("Yellow River Cantata," "People of the World Are of One Mind," etc.), solos, instrumental music, dances, acrobatics, etc.

The artistic performances of Chinese youth aroused great welcome. When the premiere was held at the Berlin Sports Palace, all 6,400 seats were filled. President Pieck, Prime Minister Grotewohl, and Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht of the German Democratic Republic were all present to watch the performance. When performing at Marx-Engels Square, 70,000 to 80,000 spectators gathered and remained focused throughout the performance. The Chinese youth's artistic programs were performed 34 times, with an audience of more than 280,000 people.

In the artistic competition with the participation of thirty-two countries, Chinese youth won the second prize for composition ("People of the World Are of One Mind") and the first prize for dance. Acrobatics also won a prize. After each performance, the presentation of flowers and gifts was very enthusiastic, with applause and curtain calls lasting for a long time, and the audience repeatedly requested that some programs be performed again.

One of the main characteristics of the Chinese youth's artistic programs that was praised by young friends from all over the world is its close combination with the struggle to defend peace and strive for people's liberation, and its implementation of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy - that it serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Since it is closely related to the struggle of Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers, it also has distinct national characteristics. The artistic programs of Chinese youth also embody the joyful and enthusiastic optimism of the victorious Chinese people. Berlin newspapers have published several articles praising the artistic programs of Chinese youth.

The Chinese youth basketball and volleyball teams participating in the 11th World Student Summer Games won the sixth prize. But the more important gain is that we observed and learned many good experiences in sports from the Soviet Union and other countries.

We Must Fight More Closely to Defend Peace

The festival is a huge victory for the youth of the world in defending peace. It has greatly strengthened the unity of youth around the world, enhanced the friendship and understanding of youth from all countries, and increased the confidence and determination of young peace fighters. At the same time, it has also enhanced the prestige of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and expanded its connection with the vast number of young people.

However, the enemies of peace will never relax their evil plans to prepare for war. Their persecution of youth participating in the festival has increased. After Billinguer, chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, returned home from participating in the festival, the reactionary government of Italy immediately revoked his passport. The US government wants to submit eleven American youth representatives who participated in the festival to court for trial. Before the youth representatives left the country for Berlin, the British government forced them to undergo a "cleanliness test." After returning home, they underwent another "test" and put the representatives' names on a blacklist for surveillance. When the French youth representatives returned home, they were driven out of the carriages by the police in the suburbs of Paris, and some were escorted to various stations to transfer trains, not allowed to enter Paris. This is just a part of the news that has been revealed. These persecutions have aroused the anger of the vast number of youth and people, and have also made them more vigilant to fight for peace.

Soviet youth have made outstanding performances in the great struggle to defend world peace at this festival. The achievements of Soviet youth in artistic sports performances and competitions are very excellent. It shows that the generation of young people cared for and cultivated by Comrade Stalin is a role model for young people all over the world.

After returning home, the Chinese youth delegation believes that in order to strengthen the efforts of Chinese youth to defend peace, it is necessary to report the great victory of this festival to the youth of the whole country. At the same time, it is necessary to report to all Chinese youth the friendship of youth from all over the world, especially Soviet youth, German youth, and youth from various Asian countries, and the education of internationalism and patriotism that we have gained at the festival. From participating in the festival, we deeply feel that the struggle of Chinese youth and the Chinese people, from the past to the present and to the future, is not isolated. Just as Chairman Mao said: "Our friends are all over the world." The forces of defending peace are growing day by day, and the warmongers are doomed to fail.

The work of the Chinese youth delegation at the festival won lofty international honors and was awarded the "Solidarity Award" by the International Committee of the Festival. The glory of all Chinese youth naturally belongs first and foremost to Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, who led the Chinese people and Chinese youth to great victory.

Chinese youth must strengthen their efforts to defend peace in order to fulfill their increasingly important responsibilities in the cause of world peace.

    参加第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的经过
    中国青年代表团
    全世界青年对中国青年的深厚
    友谊
    联欢节同时是各国青年增进真挚友谊和相互了解的大熔炉。不只是各国青年在拥挤的马路上互相热烈地高呼“友谊！”，握手，拥抱，签名题字，赠送礼物和证章，而且各国青年代表之间在柏林还举行了许多次大大小小的联欢会。苏联青年和美国青年一齐高唱世界民主青年进行曲。法国的著名和平战士雷蒙达·第安（她才二十岁，曾因卧轨阻止运军火到越南的火车而被捕判罪）和越南人民军失去右手的战斗英雄互相拥抱。朝鲜的青年和美国、英国、加拿大爱好和平的青年联欢。
    中国青年由于自己在保卫和平事业上的成就，给予各国青年以很大的鼓励，获得各国爱好和平青年的热爱和尊敬。中国青年代表团在赴柏林途中，就受到苏联青年盛大的欢迎和极热情的招待。我们对于苏联青年朋友和列宁——斯大林共产主义青年团的帮助应该致以亲切的谢意。
    在联欢节期间为了更进一步加强中国青年和各国青年的友谊，中国青年代表团举行了六次大联欢会，分别邀请了来自欧、美、澳三洲二十二个国家的青年代表、亚洲各国的青年代表、拉丁美洲和非洲的二十六个国家的青年代表、东欧人民民主国家的青年代表、德国青年代表，以及苏联青年代表团举行了联欢。
    这些热情的友谊的联欢达到了增进相互了解的深刻效果。美国青年称呼和中国青年代表的这次联欢会是“有历史意义的”。他们说，尽管美国青年被迫在朝鲜和中国青年作战，但联欢会却表示了中美两国青年保卫和平的共同意志。朝鲜青年代表团团长金琐镇感谢中国人民和中国青年给予朝鲜人民的援助，越南青年代表强调中国青年的斗争是越南青年的好榜样，印度代表感谢苏联和中国人民用粮食来帮助他们解救饥荒。他们说：“中国人民的战斗道路像灯塔般鼓舞着印度人民。”西非的代表说，西非人民认为毛泽东是他们争取民族独立的明灯。中国青年代表中的战斗英雄受到各国青年极热烈的欢迎。中国青年代表在与苏联青年代表的联欢会上，特别表达了中国青年要以苏联青年作为自己的榜样、并向苏联列宁——斯大林共产主义青年团学习的诚恳愿望。
    在这些联欢会上，中国青年把许多礼物送给各国青年，并且表演了精彩的文艺节目。在每次联欢会上，“斯大林”“毛泽东”的名字引起长时间的鼓掌和欢呼。在每次联欢会后，大家握手拥抱，依依不舍。有许多青年在临别时感动得流泪。
    这里要特别提到的是中德青年的深厚友谊。为了迎接联欢节，德国青年把柏林的列宁大街布置成为
    “中国街”。这条街上不只有巨幅五星红旗和毛主席像，而且有许多中文标语，中国图画。橱窗中的陈设也放置了许多中国古代和近代的工艺品与艺术品。在中国青年代表团到达柏林之后，几乎每天都有几十几百甚至上千的德国青年到我们住所来联欢，互相表演艺术节目和交换礼品。中国青年曾经和德国青年、人民警察和少年先锋队作了极热情的联欢，又曾被邀请到自由德国青年联盟总部联欢。冯文彬同志代表中国青年把一面中国新民主主义青年团的团旗送给德国青年，自由德国青年联盟主席昂纳克在接受时说：“让这面胜利的旗帜把中国人民的胜利带给德国人民吧！”
    中国青年代表曾经热情慰问了八月十五日在西柏林被西德警察袭击受伤的德国青年，并向西德反动派发出了严正的抗议。这次袭击是美帝国主义和西德反动派最无耻的暴行。反动派每天宣传邀请参加联欢节的青年到西柏林参观，但是十万德国青年进入西柏林去商讨共同保卫和平问题时，就遭到他们木棍水龙的袭击，四百以上的青年受伤，成百的失踪被捕。自由德国青年联盟总部代表库希说：“当德国青年在西柏林争取和平集会中受到美国警察袭击时，他们就想到了中国青年和中国青年的斗争道路。”
    中国青年收到难以数计的礼物，除了旗帜、书报、照片以外，还有各种机器模型，仪器，美术品，玻璃，瓷器，望远镜，照像机，文具，乐器，巴伐利亚省汽车厂的工人亲自驾驶了一辆新的救护汽车送给中国人民志愿军，蔡斯光学工厂送给中国青年一套天文仪器，这都是极为深厚的友谊表现。
    为了感谢德国人民的热烈招待，中国青年代表团团长冯文彬同志代表中国青年向皮克总统和格罗提渥总理献了礼，并同时献礼给德国统一社会党的中央委员会。
    中国青年的艺术表演获得了崇
    高的荣誉
    文化艺术和体育活动，是联欢节的另一个主要组成部分。七十八个国家青年参加表演节目，总共演出三百五十场以上。艺术节目观众的总数超过一百六十万人，电影的观众超过六十九万人。
    来自世界各国的青年朋友相互观摩彼此的艺术创造，这不只是极大规模的文化的交流，它同时还大大帮助了各民族间的了解，有力地消除着反动派所建立的各国青年之间的人为的隔阂，因而大大有益于和平事业，而且，文化体育的活动，已经证明是吸收更广泛的青年群众参加和平斗争的有力方式。
    苏联的艺术节目充分表现了社会主义制度是最能发挥青年天才和智慧的制度，战斗的朝鲜、越南也表演了鼓舞人民争取民族独立的节目。而保卫和平则是各国节目的中心内容。
    中国青年文工团为联欢节准备了很丰富的节目。节目内容有歌剧（“白毛女”、“董存瑞”和“并肩前进”），有京剧（“新三岔口”、“武松打虎”），有合唱（“黄河大合唱”、“全世界人民心一条”等），有独唱、器乐、舞蹈、杂技等。
    中国青年的艺术表演引起了极大的欢迎。当首次公演在柏林体育馆举行时，六千四百多座位全部坐满了人，德意志民主共和国总统皮克，总理格罗提渥、副总理乌布利希都到场观剧。在马恩广场演出时，七、八万观众聚精会神始终不散。中国青年的艺术节目共演出三十四场，观众达到二十八万人以上。
    在三十二个国家参加的艺术竞赛里，中国青年得到了作曲的二等奖（全世界人民心一条），舞蹈得了一等奖。杂技也得了奖。在每次演出后的献花、送礼，都非常热烈，鼓掌和谢幕延续许久，观众多次地要求某些节目再演一次。
    中国青年文艺节目获得世界青年朋友赞扬的主要特点之一，是在于它的内容和保卫和平、争取人民解放斗争的紧密结合，是在于它贯彻了毛主席的文艺方针——它是为工农兵服务的。它既然是与中国工农兵的斗争密切相联系，因而也就具有鲜明的民族特点。中国青年的艺术节目里，还体现着胜利了的中国人民愉快热烈的乐观的情绪。柏林的报纸曾好几次发表了赞扬中国青年文艺节目的评介文章。
    参加第十一届世界学生夏季运动会的中国青年篮排球获得了第六奖。但更重要的收获，是我们观摩和学习了苏联和其他国家体育运动的许多良好的经验。
    必须为保卫和平更加紧地斗争
    联欢节是全世界青年保卫和平的极巨大的胜利。它大大加强了全世界青年的团结，增进了世界各国青年的友谊和了解，提高了青年和平战士的信心和决心。同时，它也提高了世界民主青年联盟的威信和扩大了它与广大青年的联系。
    但是，和平的敌人绝不会因此松弛他们准备战争的罪恶计划，他们对参加联欢节青年的迫害还在有加无已。意大利的反动政府在世界民主青年联盟主席比林格尔参加联欢节返国之后，立即收回了他的护照。美国政府要把参加联欢节的美国青年代表十一名提交法庭审判。英国政府在青年代表离国到柏林以前，强迫他们接受一次“清白考试”，回国以后又经过一次“考试”，并把代表名字列入黑名单加以监视。法国的青年代表回国时，在巴黎郊区被警察赶出车厢，有的被押到各站转车，不许进入巴黎。这不过是已经透露出来的一部分消息罢了，这些迫害引起了广大青年和人民的愤怒，也引起他们更加警惕地为和平而战。
    苏联青年在本届联欢节保卫世界和平的伟大斗争中，有着卓越的表现。苏联青年的艺术体育表演和竞赛的成就，都是十分优异的。它显示了斯大林同志所关心与培养出的一代青年，是全世界青年学习的榜样。
    中国青年代表团回国以后，认为为了更加强中国青年保卫和平的努力，必须把这次联欢节的伟大胜利报告给全国青年。同时必须把全世界青年，特别是苏联青年、德国青年、亚洲各国青年对中国青年的友谊，我们在联欢节所获得的国际主义与爱国主义的教育，报告给全中国青年。我们从参加联欢节中，深切感到中国青年与中国人民的斗争，从过去到现在到将来，都不是孤立的。正像毛主席说过的：“我们的朋友遍于全世界。”保卫和平的力量正在日益增涨，战争贩子是注定要失败的。
    中国青年代表团在联欢节的工作，获得了崇高的国际荣誉，并获得联欢节国际委员会所颁发的“团结奖”。所有中国青年的光荣，自然首先应该属于领导中国人民和中国青年获得伟大胜利的毛泽东主席和中国共产党。
    中国青年必须更加强自己的保卫和平的努力，才能完成自己在世界和平事业中日益加重的职责。
