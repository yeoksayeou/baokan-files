    North China Begins Purchasing New Cotton
    Cotton Production in Most Areas Increases Compared to Last Year
    Since mid-August, new cotton has been successively entering the market in the cotton-producing areas of North China. State-owned trading organizations and cooperatives are busily purchasing the new cotton. In the first ten days of September alone, the Pingyuan Province Textile Company purchased 380,000 catties of ginned cotton, Shanxi Province purchased 370,000 catties, and Hebei Province purchased 3,920,000 catties.
    This year, the cotton planting area in North China expanded by 30% compared to last year. Except for some cotton-growing areas in Hebei Province that suffered from insect pests and experienced a slight reduction in production, the per-mu yield in all areas increased compared to last year. Therefore, the purchasing work in various places is extremely intense. The number of raw cotton grading personnel trained by the Shanxi Provincial State-owned Textile Company and cooperatives at all levels has increased by more than 500 compared to last year. In Yi County, Shanxi Province, there were only two cotton purchasing stations last year, but this year the number has increased to thirteen, and the number of purchasing personnel has also increased from fifteen last year to one hundred and twenty-six this year. More than 140 new purchasing stations and textile company groups have been established in the Jinan and Jinzhong cotton-producing areas. In order to ensure that ginning is done as soon as the cotton is collected and that raw materials are supplied to the urban textile industry in a timely manner, various cotton-producing areas are actively preparing ginning machines. For example, the Anguo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province has organized 128 ginning machines, which can gin more than 200,000 catties of cotton per day. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北开始收购新棉
    大部地区棉产量较去年增加
    八月中旬以来，华北各产棉区的新棉陆续上市。国营贸易机关和合作社正紧张地收购新棉。仅九月初旬十天当中，平原省花纱布公司即收购皮棉三十八万斤，山西省收购了三十七万斤，河北省收购了三百九十二万斤。
    华北区今年植棉面积比去年扩大百分之三十。除河北省部分棉区遭受虫害略有减产外，各地每亩单位面积产量都比去年增加。因此各地收购工作极为紧张。山西省国营花纱布公司和各级合作社训练的原棉分级人员即比去年增加五百多人。该省猗氏县去年只有两个棉花收购站，今年增加到十三个，收购人员也由去年的十五人增加到今年的一百二十六人。晋南和晋中产棉区新设收购站和花纱布公司小组一百四十多个。为了保证作到随收随轧，及时供给城市纺织工业原料，各产棉区正积极准备轧车。如河北省安国县供销合作社已组织好轧车一百二十八辆，每日能轧花二十多万斤。（新华社）
