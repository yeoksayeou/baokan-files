Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 14th: *L'Humanité* published a letter from the Central Committee of the French Communist Party to the French people, calling on the French people to rise up and stop the French reactionary ruling group's policy of national betrayal.

The French Communist Party Central Committee's letter to the people first pointed out: Three months after the general election, the lives of the French people are becoming more and more difficult. France is under American occupation, and the French economy is subordinate to the interests of the dollar magnates. Inflation is increasing, with 2 billion francs of paper money being printed every day. The French army has been handed over to foreign command. The French army is being used to carry out wars against the people of Korea and Vietnam, which violate national interests, and is also being used to suppress the French people at home. On the French border, the West German Nazi defense forces are being established, and Tito and Franco, with the participation of the French rulers, are playing the role of provoking a third world war that will turn France into scorched earth.

The French Communist Party Central Committee's letter to the people said: The French people have been deceived. The deceitful group has slandered the Soviet Union, saying it wants war, but the facts have proved that the Soviet Union is defending peace. When the Soviet Union proposed the conclusion of a peace pact, the United States government was building its war system in Asia and Europe by relying on the remilitarization of Japan and West Germany.

The French Communist Party hopes to implement a policy of peace and independence for France. This policy should be based on the conclusion of a five-power peace pact with France's participation. This policy requires the overthrow of the agreements that subordinate France to the United States, the cessation of the American occupation of French territory, the elimination of West German militarism, and the cessation of the Vietnam War. A peaceful French policy requires the confirmation of the Franco-Soviet treaty guaranteeing French security, and advocates maintaining a truly national and democratic army.

The letter to the people demands an increase in workers' wages, improvement of social insurance, stabilization of prices, and protection of French industry from American invasion.

The letter to the people said: The American bosses, with the participation of the French reactionaries, are attempting to establish a de Gaulle fascist dictatorship for the benefit of American capitalists, so as to further impose a policy of war on the French people. Therefore, it is now urgent for workers of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, as well as workers of the Popular Republican Movement, to unite, and for all workers to unite with all anti-fascists and republicans in the country to act in concert to block the road to fascism.

The letter to the people calls on French patriots to raise the banner of fighting for national independence in the provincial and regional elections in October, and to ensure the success of the candidates of the anti-fascist republican resistance alliance proposed by the French Communist Party. The letter to the people concludes by saying that the Communists are willing to fight side by side with all those who hope to implement a policy of peace and independence for France.

    法共中央号召法国人民团结斗争
    制止法国反动政府卖国政策
    在地方选举中保证法共提出的候选人获选
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：《人道报》刊载法国共产党中央委员会告法国人民书，号召法国人民奋起制止法国反动统治集团的卖国政策。
    法共中央告人民书首先指出：举行大选后三个月以来，法国人民的生活一天比一天困难。法国处于美国的占领下，法国经济从属于美元大王们的利益。通货膨胀有增无已，每天印出纸币达二十亿法郎之多。法国军队已交给外国来指挥。法国军队被用来进行违反民族利益的反对朝鲜与越南人民的战争，同时并用来在国内镇压法国人民。在法国国境线上，西德纳粹国防军正在建立，铁托与佛朗哥在法国统治者参与下，正在扮演着挑起使法国化为焦土的第三次大战的角色。
    法共中央告人民书说：法国人民受了骗。骗子集团曾经诽谤苏联说它要战争，但是事实证明，苏联却在捍卫和平。当苏联建议缔结和平公约时，美国政府却正在凭借日本和西德的重新军国主义化在亚洲和欧洲建立它的战争体系。
    法国共产党希望实行和平的独立的法兰西政策。这个政策应以缔结有法国参加的五大国和平公约为基础。这个政策要求推翻使法国从属于美国的协定，要求停止美国对法国领土的占领，要求肃清西德的军国主义，要求停止越南战争。和平的法兰西政策要求确认保证法国安全的法苏条约，主张保有真正的民族的民主的军队。
    告人民书要求增加劳动者的工资，改进社会保险，平抑物价，保护法国工业不受美国侵犯。
    告人民书说：美国的头子们在法国反动派的参与下，为了美国资本家的利益，正在企图建立戴高乐的法西斯独裁，以便把战争政策进一步加在法国人民头上。因此，现在就迫切需要社会党与共产党的劳动者以及天主教人民共和党的劳动者联合起来，需要全体劳动者与全国一切反法西斯分子和共和分子联合起来，一致行动，以堵住法西斯主义的道路。
    告人民书号召法国的爱国人士在十月份举行的省区选举中高举争取国家独立的大旗，保证法国共产党所提出的反法西斯共和抵抗联盟的候选人获得成功。告人民书最后说，共产党人愿与一切希望实行和平的独立的法兰西政策的人们并肩奋斗。
