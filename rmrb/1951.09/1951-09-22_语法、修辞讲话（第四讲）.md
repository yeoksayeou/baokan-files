Eighth Paragraph: Separation and Combination, and Parenthetical Remarks

	Sharing a common component. We briefly discussed in the first lecture, fifth paragraph, how several words or phrases can be combined to relate to another component. However, some structures of this kind are new and represent an emerging syntax. For example:
	(1) Observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid life and struggle methods, and all natural forms of literature and art. (Mao)
	(2) Kang Youwei wrote "The Book of Great Harmony," but he did not and could not find a path to Great Harmony. (Mao)
	(3) The volunteer troops we sent have never disgraced the motherland; rather, they have and continue to bring glory to the motherland. (Periodical)
	(4) But we do not want to ignore, and we must not ignore, this voice. (Periodical)
	In (1), the four verbs "observe," "experience," "study," and "analyze" share a long object "all people..." (See Third Lecture, Paragraph 1, Examples 19 and 20.) In (2), "did not" and "could not" share "find." In (3), "have" and "continue" share "bring glory to the motherland." (4) is formally close to (1), but since the two "ignore" are identical, it is essentially close to (2); if the first "ignore" is omitted, it would be formally close to (2).

	This syntax is useful because it makes speech economical. However, it needs to be used with caution. The following three sentences all have problems.
	(5) But these problems were fully resolved after sufficient deliberation, organized study, and discussion. (Newspaper)
	(6) In addition, the government is requested to issue cotton seeds earlier next year and to issue more of them. (Periodical)
	(7) I have more than a year of combat experience, more than three years of grain work experience, and five years of supply work experience. (Letter)
	The structure of (5) is exactly the same as (1), but because "study" and "discussion" are also verbs, it is not easy for people to understand at a glance, let alone to understand when listening. (Compare Third Lecture, Paragraph 1, Example 24.) The structure of (6) is the same as (4), but "issue more of them" does not conform to general usage; the general habit is to say "issue a little more." In fact, if we say "issue cotton seeds a little earlier, and issue a little more," it does not add words, but it is much more natural. So why bother to follow the trend rigidly? In (7), "combat experience" and "grain work experience" are tightly bound phrases. Forcibly omitting the two instances of "experience" results in a very awkward sentence.

	Repeating a component. On the one hand, we should welcome this relatively compact and economical emerging syntax; on the other hand, we should also remember and appreciate the seemingly uneconomical but very vivid and powerful inherent syntax. For example:
	(8) That is to say, our study style still has some unhealthy aspects, our Party style still has some unhealthy aspects, and our writing style also has some unhealthy aspects. (Mao)
	(9) Some people despise local cadres and ridicule local cadres. (Mao)
	(10) This is to unite the Soviet Union, unite all the new democratic countries, and unite the proletariat and broad masses of other countries to form an international united front. (Mao)
	(11) This is our formula, this is our main experience, and this is our main program. (Mao)
	(12) Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly. (Mao)
	Can't the same components in these sentences be combined and said once? Yes, every sentence can. But after merging, it is far less vivid and powerful than the original. (Compare Third Lecture, Paragraph 1, Examples 11, 12, and 13.) In short, these two syntaxes each have their own advantages. Combine when appropriate, separate when appropriate. "Sing the song of the mountain you're on," and don't rigidly stick to one formula.

	Difficulty in separating and combining. The sentences in the previous two sections are examples of separation and combination, and the following two sentences represent a situation where separation and combination are both difficult.
	(13) The Ministry of Textile Industry plans to increase the national yarn and cloth production within 1951 by 25 percent for cotton yarn and 30 percent for cotton cloth compared to the actual production in 1950. (Periodical)
	(14) These factories that have already been relocated or are awaiting relocation are either for the convenience of raw materials, such as the yarn factory's relocation to Henan, or for the market, such as the toothpaste factory's relocation to Tianjin, etc. (Periodical)

	In (13), first generally saying "yarn and cloth," then having to separate them, makes the sentence structure very awkward. It would be better to change it to "to increase the national cotton yarn production by 25 percent compared to the actual production in 1950, and cotton cloth production by 30 percent." The structure of (14) is barely acceptable, but it would be better to change it to "The relocation of these factories is either for the convenience of raw materials..." (Already relocated and awaiting relocation have been mentioned above and can be omitted).

	Parenthetical remarks. Breaking the structure of a sentence and inserting a sentence used to be a type of syntax, but it was not commonly used. Recently, this type of syntax has become more common, influenced by foreign grammar. The most common, of course, is the format of inserting "so-and-so said" in the middle of a dialogue, which is seen every day and does not need an example. The following are also examples of parenthetical remarks.
	(15) Under this layer-by-layer exploitation, the current women's team leader of Baiyang Village, Xigang Township, told us that she owed a landlord in the village 30 yuan back then, and the seized land was not even enough to cover the debt. (Periodical)
	(16) If you can't even recognize twenty-odd letters, please forgive me for speaking frankly, then you probably won't learn chemistry well either. (Lu)
	(17) An American reporter, said to be from the New York Post, sees his world as truly broad. (Periodical)
	(18) At the last table on the street, four tables away from the commotion, a calm negotiation was nearing its end. (Book)
	
	The parenthetical remarks in (17) and (18) can be changed to appositives, but that would be a bit cumbersome, so it is better to use the flexible format of parenthetical remarks.

	When applying the format of parenthetical remarks, the most important thing is to not allow it to change the original structure, thus creating ambiguity. For example:
	(19) The reason is that social differentiation is not easy, at least based on past history, there is only cooperation and no conflict. (Book)
	(20) Suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, like these bad elements who harm the people, is of course reasonable, and we do not pity them at all. (Work)
	Nine out of ten readers will take "social differentiation is not easy" in (19) as a clause; and at least five will misunderstand "bad elements" in (20) as the subject of "is reasonable." In (19), "not easy" should be moved after "at least based on past history." In (20), the word "like" should be changed to "suppressing".

	Especially, particularly, first and foremost, at least, or. Some phrases headed by these words have a status somewhat like parenthetical remarks, and somewhat like a member of a combined component, sharing another component before or after. For example:
	(21) This is an important achievement of more than a hundred years, especially thirty years, of long-term revolutionary struggle. (Lu Dingyi)
	(22) Lenin himself, as early as 1900, particularly in 1912 and 1913, had already paid attention to the Chinese question and wrote important papers on the Chinese question. (Hu Qiaomu)
	(23) I know that young people, especially literary youth, nine out of ten are very sensitive and have strong self-esteem. (Lu)
	(24) The people of the whole country, first and foremost the working people, must understand and support the struggle of women against feudal marriage oppression. (Newspaper)
	(25) Any hero, only when he correctly represents the direction of historical progress, represents, or at least in some important aspects represents, the will and interests of the broad masses of the people, can he become a true hero. (Newspaper)
	(26) However, he also depicted a woman of the Chinese Communist Party, or related to the Party. (Newspaper)

	This is also a very useful emerging syntax, as it can help us express the meaning more comprehensively by distinguishing between importance and weight. However, it also needs to be used with caution. For example:
	(27) He made a very high evaluation of modern Chinese art, especially the achievements of woodcuts. (Periodical)
	(28) The Gu Zhenghong incident of domestic and foreign cotton eleven years ago, especially after the January 28th War five years ago, the demand of Eastern manufacturers for this special cheap "machine" suddenly increased. (Education)
	(29) They realized that the problem cannot be solved by one or two demonstrations, and that there must be a broad and lasting force, especially a broad, lasting, and united force. (Periodical)
	(30) Following military liberation and political liberation, the economy has also been thoroughly liberated. This not only refers to the liberation of productive forces, but especially to the liberation of production relations. (Periodical)
	(31) In every part of the liberated motherland, especially the youth, the desire for Soviet literary works and films is increasing day by day. (Newspaper)
	(32) This nationwide, vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has basically swept away the pro-American, worship-America, and fear-America psychology given to our people by imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. (Newspaper)
	(33) Of course, English translation work is still relatively good, while the standard of Russian translation work is especially not high enough. (Periodical)
	(34) The reason lies in the fact that the compiled teaching materials are not based on or completely based on careful research of the actual situation. (Periodical)

	In (27), "especially the achievements of woodcuts" should be inserted after "modern Chinese art." In (28), "after" should be added after "Gu Zhenghong incident." (29) has a bit of an affectation of syntax; if one must emphasize "unity," "there must be a broad, lasting, and especially united force" would be enough. (30) uses "especially" to echo "not only," which is not common. This sentence can be changed to "not only liberating productive forces, but more importantly, changing production relations" (production relations can only be said to be changed, not liberated). (31) "Place" and "youth" cannot be linked with "especially." (32) It is illogical to say that the pro-American, worship-America, and fear-America psychology was given by all imperialism (although "especially U.S. imperialism"). (It is rare to not follow "swept away" with "and emptied." And since it is swept away, how can it only be "basically"?) In (33), using "especially" between one good and one bad thing completely forgets what "especially" means, and should be changed to "is not high enough." If the first half of the sentence is "English translation work is no longer satisfactory," then "especially" can be used in the second half. (34) is a negative sentence, so it is not impossible to say it this way with effort, but it would be better to change it to "is not based on, at least is not completely based on."

	Finally, let's talk about the mutual relationship between the words before and after "especially" or "particularly." Taking (21) and (22) as examples, "thirty years" is included in "more than a hundred years," but "1912 and 1913" and "1900" are not mutually inclusive. Both of these situations are common. "Particularly" is also the same. (23) is inclusive, and (28) is not inclusive. Since there are these two different situations, and there are "especially" and "particularly," these two equally common words, if everyone agrees, why not let them divide the work? -- For example, use "particularly" for inclusive and "especially" for non-inclusive. (End of this paragraph, end of the entire text.)
