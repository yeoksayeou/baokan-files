Eighth Paragraph: Separation and Combination, and Parenthetical Remarks

	Sharing a common component. We briefly discussed in the first lecture, fifth paragraph, how several words or phrases can be combined to relate to another component. However, some structures of this kind are new and represent an emerging syntax. For example:
	(1) Observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid life and struggle methods, and all natural forms of literature and art. (Mao)
	(2) Kang Youwei wrote "The Book of Great Harmony," but he did not and could not find a path to Great Harmony. (Mao)
	(3) The volunteer troops we sent have never disgraced the motherland; rather, they have and continue to bring glory to the motherland. (Periodical)
	(4) But we do not want to ignore, and we must not ignore, this voice. (Periodical)
	In (1), the four verbs "observe," "experience," "study," and "analyze" share a long object "all people..." (See Third Lecture, Paragraph 1, Examples 19 and 20.) In (2), "did not" and "could not" share "find." In (3), "have" and "continue" share "bring glory to the motherland." (4) is formally close to (1), but since the two "ignore" are identical, it is essentially close to (2); if the first "ignore" is omitted, it would be formally close to (2).

	This syntax is useful because it makes speech economical. However, it needs to be used with caution. The following three sentences all have problems.
	(5) But these problems were fully resolved after sufficient deliberation, organized study, and discussion. (Newspaper)
	(6) In addition, the government is requested to issue cotton seeds earlier next year and to issue more of them. (Periodical)
	(7) I have more than a year of combat experience, more than three years of grain work experience, and five years of supply work experience. (Letter)
	The structure of (5) is exactly the same as (1), but because "study" and "discussion" are also verbs, it is not easy for people to understand at a glance, let alone to understand when listening. (Compare Third Lecture, Paragraph 1, Example 24.) The structure of (6) is the same as (4), but "issue more of them" does not conform to general usage; the general habit is to say "issue a little more." In fact, if we say "issue cotton seeds a little earlier, and issue a little more," it does not add words, but it is much more natural. So why bother to follow the trend rigidly? In (7), "combat experience" and "grain work experience" are tightly bound phrases. Forcibly omitting the two instances of "experience" results in a very awkward sentence.

	Repeating a component. On the one hand, we should welcome this relatively compact and economical emerging syntax; on the other hand, we should also remember and appreciate the seemingly uneconomical but very vivid and powerful inherent syntax. For example:
	(8) That is to say, our study style still has some unhealthy aspects, our Party style still has some unhealthy aspects, and our writing style also has some unhealthy aspects. (Mao)
	(9) Some people despise local cadres and ridicule local cadres. (Mao)
	(10) This is to unite the Soviet Union, unite all the new democratic countries, and unite the proletariat and broad masses of other countries to form an international united front. (Mao)
	(11) This is our formula, this is our main experience, and this is our main program. (Mao)
	(12) Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly. (Mao)
	Can't the same components in these sentences be combined and said once? Yes, every sentence can. But after merging, it is far less vivid and powerful than the original. (Compare Third Lecture, Paragraph 1, Examples 11, 12, and 13.) In short, these two syntaxes each have their own advantages. Combine when appropriate, separate when appropriate. "Sing the song of the mountain you're on," and don't rigidly stick to one formula.

	Difficulty in separating and combining. The sentences in the previous two sections are examples of separation and combination, and the following two sentences represent a situation where separation and combination are both difficult.
	(13) The Ministry of Textile Industry plans to increase the national yarn and cloth production within 1951 by 25 percent for cotton yarn and 30 percent for cotton cloth compared to the actual production in 1950. (Periodical)
	(14) These factories that have already been relocated or are awaiting relocation are either for the convenience of raw materials, such as the yarn factory's relocation to Henan, or for the market, such as the toothpaste factory's relocation to Tianjin, etc. (Periodical)

	In (13), first generally saying "yarn and cloth," then having to separate them, makes the sentence structure very awkward. It would be better to change it to "to increase the national cotton yarn production by 25 percent compared to the actual production in 1950, and cotton cloth production by 30 percent." The structure of (14) is barely acceptable, but it would be better to change it to "The relocation of these factories is either for the convenience of raw materials..." (Already relocated and awaiting relocation have been mentioned above and can be omitted).

	Parenthetical remarks. Breaking the structure of a sentence and inserting a sentence used to be a type of syntax, but it was not commonly used. Recently, this type of syntax has become more common, influenced by foreign grammar. The most common, of course, is the format of inserting "so-and-so said" in the middle of a dialogue, which is seen every day and does not need an example. The following are also examples of parenthetical remarks.
	(15) Under this layer-by-layer exploitation, the current women's team leader of Baiyang Village, Xigang Township, told us that she owed a landlord in the village 30 yuan back then, and the seized land was not even enough to cover the debt. (Periodical)
	(16) If you can't even recognize twenty-odd letters, please forgive me for speaking frankly, then you probably won't learn chemistry well either. (Lu)
	(17) An American reporter, said to be from the New York Post, sees his world as truly broad. (Periodical)
	(18) At the last table on the street, four tables away from the commotion, a calm negotiation was nearing its end. (Book)
	
	The parenthetical remarks in (17) and (18) can be changed to appositives, but that would be a bit cumbersome, so it is better to use the flexible format of parenthetical remarks.

	When applying the format of parenthetical remarks, the most important thing is to not allow it to change the original structure, thus creating ambiguity. For example:
	(19) The reason is that social differentiation is not easy, at least based on past history, there is only cooperation and no conflict. (Book)
	(20) Suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, like these bad elements who harm the people, is of course reasonable, and we do not pity them at all. (Work)
	Nine out of ten readers will take "social differentiation is not easy" in (19) as a clause; and at least five will misunderstand "bad elements" in (20) as the subject of "is reasonable." In (19), "not easy" should be moved after "at least based on past history." In (20), the word "like" should be changed to "suppressing".

	Especially, particularly, first and foremost, at least, or. Some phrases headed by these words have a status somewhat like parenthetical remarks, and somewhat like a member of a combined component, sharing another component before or after. For example:
	(21) This is an important achievement of more than a hundred years, especially thirty years, of long-term revolutionary struggle. (Lu Dingyi)
	(22) Lenin himself, as early as 1900, particularly in 1912 and 1913, had already paid attention to the Chinese question and wrote important papers on the Chinese question. (Hu Qiaomu)
	(23) I know that young people, especially literary youth, nine out of ten are very sensitive and have strong self-esteem. (Lu)
	(24) The people of the whole country, first and foremost the working people, must understand and support the struggle of women against feudal marriage oppression. (Newspaper)
	(25) Any hero, only when he correctly represents the direction of historical progress, represents, or at least in some important aspects represents, the will and interests of the broad masses of the people, can he become a true hero. (Newspaper)
	(26) However, he also depicted a woman of the Chinese Communist Party, or related to the Party. (Newspaper)

	This is also a very useful emerging syntax, as it can help us express the meaning more comprehensively by distinguishing between importance and weight. However, it also needs to be used with caution. For example:
	(27) He made a very high evaluation of modern Chinese art, especially the achievements of woodcuts. (Periodical)
	(28) The Gu Zhenghong incident of domestic and foreign cotton eleven years ago, especially after the January 28th War five years ago, the demand of Eastern manufacturers for this special cheap "machine" suddenly increased. (Education)
	(29) They realized that the problem cannot be solved by one or two demonstrations, and that there must be a broad and lasting force, especially a broad, lasting, and united force. (Periodical)
	(30) Following military liberation and political liberation, the economy has also been thoroughly liberated. This not only refers to the liberation of productive forces, but especially to the liberation of production relations. (Periodical)
	(31) In every part of the liberated motherland, especially the youth, the desire for Soviet literary works and films is increasing day by day. (Newspaper)
	(32) This nationwide, vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has basically swept away the pro-American, worship-America, and fear-America psychology given to our people by imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. (Newspaper)
	(33) Of course, English translation work is still relatively good, while the standard of Russian translation work is especially not high enough. (Periodical)
	(34) The reason lies in the fact that the compiled teaching materials are not based on or completely based on careful research of the actual situation. (Periodical)

	In (27), "especially the achievements of woodcuts" should be inserted after "modern Chinese art." In (28), "after" should be added after "Gu Zhenghong incident." (29) has a bit of an affectation of syntax; if one must emphasize "unity," "there must be a broad, lasting, and especially united force" would be enough. (30) uses "especially" to echo "not only," which is not common. This sentence can be changed to "not only liberating productive forces, but more importantly, changing production relations" (production relations can only be said to be changed, not liberated). (31) "Place" and "youth" cannot be linked with "especially." (32) It is illogical to say that the pro-American, worship-America, and fear-America psychology was given by all imperialism (although "especially U.S. imperialism"). (It is rare to not follow "swept away" with "and emptied." And since it is swept away, how can it only be "basically"?) In (33), using "especially" between one good and one bad thing completely forgets what "especially" means, and should be changed to "is not high enough." If the first half of the sentence is "English translation work is no longer satisfactory," then "especially" can be used in the second half. (34) is a negative sentence, so it is not impossible to say it this way with effort, but it would be better to change it to "is not based on, at least is not completely based on."

	Finally, let's talk about the mutual relationship between the words before and after "especially" or "particularly." Taking (21) and (22) as examples, "thirty years" is included in "more than a hundred years," but "1912 and 1913" and "1900" are not mutually inclusive. Both of these situations are common. "Particularly" is also the same. (23) is inclusive, and (28) is not inclusive. Since there are these two different situations, and there are "especially" and "particularly," these two equally common words, if everyone agrees, why not let them divide the work? -- For example, use "particularly" for inclusive and "especially" for non-inclusive.

    语法、修辞讲话（第四讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第八段  分合和插说
    公用一个成分。  几个词语联合起来，共同跟另一个成分发生关系，我们在第一讲第五段里已经大略说过。但是有一些这一类的结构是过去没有的，是一种新兴的句法。例如：
    （一）观察、体验、研究、分析一切人、一切阶
    级、一切群众、一切生动的生活和斗争方
    式、一切自然形态的文学和艺术。（毛）
    （二）康有为写了“大同书”，他没有也不可能
    找到一条到达大同之路。（毛）
    （三）我们派遣的志愿部队绝未给祖国丢脸，而
    是已经并且继续为祖国增光。（期）
    （四）但是我们并不想忽视，并且决不能忽视这
    种声音。（期）（一）的“观察”“体验”“研究”“分析”四个动词公用一个长宾语“一切人……”。（参阅第三讲第一段十九、二十例。）（二）的“没有”和“不可能”公用“找到”。（三）的“已经”和“继续”公用“为祖国增光”。（四）在形式上接近（一），但是两个“忽视”是相同的，实质上接近（二）；如果省去第一个“忽视”，形式上也就接近了。
    这种句法很有用，因为它使说话经济。但是用起来还是需要小心。像下面这三句就都出了毛病。
    （五）但这些问题经充分酝酿、组织学习、讨
    论，终于得到解决。（报）
    （六）另外，就是要求明年政府要早点发给，并
    且要多点发给棉花种子。（期）
    （七）我有一年多的战斗、三年多的粮食工作、
    五年的供给工作经验。（信）（五）的构造和（一）完全一样，但是因为“学习”和“讨论”也都是动词，就不容易让人一看就明白，更不容易让人一听就懂。（比较第三讲第一段二四例。）（六）的构造和（四）相同，但是“多点发给”不合于一般的习惯，一般的习惯是说“多发点”。其实如果说“早点发给棉花种子，并且多发点”，并不增加词语，可是自然得多。那末，又何必硬去赶时髦呢？（七）的“战斗经验”“粮食工作经验”都是结合得很紧的词语，硬省掉两个“经验”，结果非常别扭。
    重复一个成分。  一方面，我们应该欢迎这种比较紧凑而经济的新起的句法；另一方面，我们也应该记得并且欣赏那种似乎不经济然而很生动有力的固有的句法。例如：
    （八）这就是说，我们的学风还有些不正的地
    方，我们的党风还有些不正的地方，我们的
    文风也有些不正的地方。（毛）
    （九）有些人轻视本地干部，讥笑本地干部。（毛）
    （十）这就是联合苏联、联合各新民主国家、联
    合其他各国的无产阶级及广大人民，结成国
    际的统一战线。（毛）
    （十一）这就是我们的公式，这就是我们的主要
    经验，这就是我们的主要纲领。（毛）
    （十二）拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实
    实地学。（毛）这些句子里不能把相同的成分合并起来一次说吗？能，句句都能。但是合并之后远不如原来的生动有力。（比较第三讲第一段十一、十二、十三例。）总之，这两种句法各有各的好处，当合则合，当分则分，“到什么山上唱什么歌，”不该死抱住一个公式不放。
    分合为难。前两节的句子都是可分可合的例子，下面这两句代表一种分合两难的情形。
    （十三）中央纺织工业部计划，在一九五一年
    内，将全国纱布产量，较一九五○年的实际
    产量，棉纱提高百分之二十五，棉布提高百
    分之三十。（期）
    （十四）这些已经迁移或者正待迁移的工厂，或
    就原料的方便，如纱厂之迁豫，或就市场，
    如牙膏厂之迁津等。（期）
    （十三）先总说“纱布”，后来又非分说不可，就弄得句子的结构很尴尬。不如改做“将全国棉纱产量较一九五○年的实际产量提高百分之二十五，棉布产量提高百分之三十”。（十四）的结构勉强可以，但不如改做“这些工厂的迁移，或是就原料的方便……”（已迁和待迁，上文已说过，可省）。
    插说  把一个句子的结构打断，插一句话进去，从前也有这种句法，但是不大常用。近来这种句法多起来，是受了外国语法的影响。最常见的自然是把“某某说”插在对话中间的格式，天天看见，不用举例。底下这些也都是插说的例子。
    （十五）就在这种层层剥削下，溪港乡白杨村的
    现任妇女大组长告诉我们说，当年欠了村里
    的一个地主三十元债，被占去了田还不够。
    （期）
    （十六）如果二十来个字母都认不清，请恕我直
    说，那么，化学也大抵学不好的。（鲁）
    （十七）一个美国记者，据说是纽约邮报的，他
    看他的世界真是宽广。（期）
    （十八）在当街的最末一张桌子上，那里离么吵
    吵隔着四张桌子，一种平心静气的谈判已近
    结束。（书）
    （十七）和（十八）的插入语都是可以改做附加语的，但是那样一来就有点笨重，不如用插说的格式灵活。
    应用插说的格式，最要紧的是不能让它有变更原来的结构因而产生歧义的可能。例如：
    （十九）原因是社会分化不容易，至少以已过的
    历史说，只有合作而没有冲突。（书）
    （二十）镇压反革命分子，像这些为害人民的坏
    东西，当然是合情合理的，我们一点也不怜
    惜他们。（作）十个读者有九个会把（十九）的“社会分化不容易”当作一个分句；也至少有五个会误会（二十）的“坏东西”是“合情合理”的主语。（十九）应该把“不容易”挪在“至少以已过的历史说”后头。
    （二十）应该把“像”字改做“镇压”。
    特别是、尤其是、首先是、至少是、或是。  由这些词语带头的一些短语，它们的地位有点像插入语，又有点像联合成分的一员，公用前面或后面的另一个成分。例如：
    （二一）这是一百多年来，特别是三十年来，长
    期革命斗争的重要成果。（陆定一）
    （二二）列宁本人，早在一九○○年，特别是在
    一九一二年和一九一三年，就已经注意中国
    问题，并写了关于中国问题的重要论文。（
    胡乔木）
    （二三）我知道青年们，尤其是文学青年们，十之
    九是感觉很敏，自尊心也很旺盛的。（鲁）
    （二四）全国人民，首先是劳动人民，必须了解和
    支持妇女的反对封建婚姻压迫的斗争。（报）
    （二五）任何英雄好汉，只有当他正确地代表了
    历史的前进方向，代表了或至少在某些重要
    方面代表了广大人民的意志和利益的时候，
    才能成为真正的英雄好汉。（报）
    （二六）可是，他也描写了一个中国共产党的，
    或与党有关系的女子。（报）这也是很有用的新兴句法，它能帮助我们把意思分别轻重，表达得更周密。但是用起来也要小心。例如：
    （二七）他对于中国现代美术，作了很高的估
    价，特别是木刻的成就。（期）
    （二八）十一年前内外棉的顾正红事件，尤其是
    五年前的一二八战争之后，东洋厂家对于这
    种特殊的廉价“机器”的需要突然的增加起
    来。（教）
    （二九）他们认识了：问题不是一两次的游行示
    威所能解决，必定要有广大而持久的力量，
    尤其是要有广大持久而团结的力量。（期）
    （三十）跟着军事的解放和政治的解放，经济也
    澈底获得解放了。这不仅是指生产力的解
    放，尤其是指生产关系的解放。（期）
    （三一）在解放了的祖国每一个地方，特别是青
    年们，对苏联文学著作和影片的渴求，是一
    天比一天增多。（报）
    （三二）这次全国规模轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝爱国
    主义运动，对于帝国主义特别是美帝国主义
    所给予我国人民的恐美、崇美、亲美心理，
    基本上为之一扫。（报）
    （三三）当然，英文翻译工作还比较好，而俄文
    翻译工作的水准尤其不够高。（期）
    （三四）原因就在于所编的教材并不是根据或完
    全根据实际情况仔细研究。（期）
    （二七）的“特别是木刻的成就”应该插在“现代美术”之后。（二八）应该在“顾正红事件”后面加“之后”。（二九）有点耍弄句法的嫌疑；如果
    一定要强调“团结”，“必定要有广大、持久、尤其是团结的力量”也很够了。（三十）用“尤其”跟“不仅”呼应，不常见。这句可以改做“不仅是解放了生产力，更重要的是改变了生产关系”（生产关系只能说改变，无所谓解放）。（三一）“地方”和“青年们”不能用“特别是”来关联。（三二）把恐美、崇美、亲美的心理说成是所有帝国主义（虽然“特别是美帝国主义”）所给予的，不通。（“一扫”下面不接“而空”，罕见。而且既然一扫而空，怎么又只是“基本上”？）（三三）在一好一坏的两件事中间用“尤其”，完全忘了“尤其”是什么意思，应该改做“就不够高了”。如果上半句是“英文翻译工作已经不能叫人满意”，下半句就用得上“尤其”了。（三四）是否定句，未尝不能勉强这样说，但不如改做“并不是根据，至少是不完全根据”。
    最后，讲一讲“特别是”或“尤其是”前后词语的相互关系。拿（二一）和（二二）做例，“三十年来”是包括在“一百多年来”里面的，但“一九一二年和一九一三年”和“一九○○年”是不相包括的。这两种情形都常见。“尤其是”也是如此，
    （二三）是包括的，（二八）就是不包括的。既有这两种不同的情形，又有“特别是”和“尤其是”这两个同样通行的词语，如果大家赞同，何不让它们分分工呢？——比如说，包括的用“尤其是”，不包括的用“特别是”。（本段完，全文未完）
