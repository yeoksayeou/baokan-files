Comrade Labor Models!

The first National Labor Model Representative Conference of the People's Railway has opened. I wish this conference a successful victory.

The convening of this conference is taking place on the eve of the second National Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, which is of great significance. At present, the entire country, except for Taiwan, has been liberated. In the great patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, the people across the country have demonstrated the strength of our powerful Chinese people is invincible, and the failure of American imperialism is doomed. Since liberation, our People's Railway, through rescue, repair, and reinforcement, has played its due role in supporting the war, facilitating material exchanges, and cooperating with national economic construction and national defense construction. Our People's Railway has made great progress in all aspects. Recalling the development process of the People's Railway: it has gone through democratic reforms, conducted class education, established the spirit of the working class as masters of the country, carried out a series of political movements, organized trade unions, and established Party and League organizations; in terms of management, it has carried out a series of reforms, adjusted institutions, adjusted positions and salaries, partially implemented responsibility systems, established worker representative conferences and management committees, implemented some new work methods, and unified some necessary systems; on this basis, there has been a simple national production plan, the development of rationalization proposals, and the new record movement. From July 1st of this year, economic accounting systems have been implemented in all railway administrations across the country.

These reforms and creations of systems were fundamentally absent and impossible to implement in old China. Because of the unified system, unified plan, coupled with the repair of lines, the enhancement of locomotive quality, the improvement of transportation operations, and the improvement of the political consciousness of all employees after liberation, there has been a leap in work efficiency. The transportation tasks for the first half of 1951 were completed 3.7 days ahead of schedule. The number of loaded wagons per day was 19,983 tons more than in the same period last year. In 1950, the ton-kilometers of goods transported by the national railway increased by 510.6 percent compared to 1935, and in the first half of 1951, it increased by 50.2 percent compared to the same period last year. In 1950, the passenger kilometers transported increased by 383.2 percent compared to 1935. In the first half of this year, it increased by 3.9 percent compared to the same period last year. The time of traffic interruption due to floods this year was reduced by 60 percent compared to last year. With the continuous creation of new records in the nationwide over-axle movement, the traction tonnage of national freight trains in the first half of 1951 increased by 3.4 percent compared to 1950, and 13.1 percent higher than that of the Northeast Railway during the puppet Manchukuo period in 1941. The travel speed of freight trains in the first half of 1951 increased by an average of 5.7 percent per hour compared to 1950. The average speed on the Northeast Railway was 24 kilometers per hour, which was 20 percent higher than during the puppet Manchukuo period in 1943. The speed of direct main passenger trains is also constantly increasing: the Shanghai-Guangzhou direct express train has now been shortened to 50 hours and 13 minutes, a reduction of 13 hours and 47 minutes from the 64 hours when it started direct service on January 10, 1950, and can be shortened by another 3 hours and 45 minutes during the winter timetable change. The Manzhouli-Beijing direct express train has been shortened to 55 hours and 59 minutes, a reduction of 3 hours and 7 minutes from the 59 hours and 6 minutes when it started in 1949, and can be shortened by another 6 hours and 22 minutes during the winter timetable change. The Beijing-Shanghai direct express train has been shortened to 36 hours and 17 minutes, a reduction of 1 hour and 23 minutes from the 37 hours and 40 minutes when the Beijing-Shanghai train first operated in early 1937, and a reduction of 9 hours and 18 minutes from the 45 hours and 35 minutes when it started in July 1949, and can be shortened by another 1 hour and 57 minutes during the winter timetable change. After the winter timetable change, the Beijing-Hankou direct train No. 7 takes 32 hours and 37 minutes for the entire journey, a reduction of 4 hours and 18 minutes. The average daily mileage of freight locomotives in the first half of 1951 was 355.6 kilometers nationwide, an increase of 5.6 kilometers compared to 1950, and 50.7 kilometers higher than the daily mileage of locomotives on the Northeast Railway during the puppet Manchukuo period in 1943.

The newly built railway projects this year include: the Chengdu-Chongqing, Tianshui-Lanzhou, and Laiyang-Zhenjiang lines, with a total length of 670 kilometers. Our achievements in road construction have exceeded any year in the history of old China. According to statistics: in the 48 years before 1927 in China, a total of 9,572 kilometers of railways were built, averaging 199 kilometers per year. From 1928 to 1941, 5,708 kilometers were added in 13 years, averaging no more than 440 kilometers per year (the above figures do not include railways invested by foreigners such as the South Manchuria Railway, the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the railways built by the Japanese invaders in China after the "September 18th Incident").

The above achievements are due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the assistance and guidance of local Party committees and governments, the help and guidance of Soviet experts, and the efforts of the 540,000 railway employees, especially the efforts of all the labor models present here. You have demonstrated great courage, wisdom, and initiative in various work positions with the attitude of being the masters of the country, and have made many creations and inventions, developed rationalization proposals, launched production competitions, and created new records, making our People's Railway progress rapidly with each passing day. You should be respected by the people and valued by the country.

Every labor model has their own glorious deeds. Due to time constraints, I cannot list them one by one. According to statistics, there were more than 20,000 labor models in the railway system last year. Among the railway workers and commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps who volunteered to join the Resist America and Aid Korea campaign, more than 85 percent have been credited for their meritorious service in the past six months. The 500 labor models present here are just representatives of these many labor models.

The purpose of this conference is to exchange experiences, learn from each other, and improve further, so that we can do a better job in various aspects of our railway work in the future. Everyone must participate in the conference with a spirit of learning. People's heroes are produced from the masses, and must be connected to the masses, united with the masses, and must humbly learn from the masses, accept technical knowledge, and concentrate the experience and wisdom of the masses, and then they can lead them and promote their progress. At the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers last year, Chairman Mao read the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which stated that combat heroes and labor models should:

"Continue to learn in combat, learn from the broad masses of the people. Only by never being arrogant or complacent and continuing to learn tirelessly can you continue to make outstanding contributions to the great People's Republic of China and thereby continue to maintain your glorious title." If a hero is arrogant and complacent, he will inevitably become detached from the masses. If a hero is detached from the masses, he will immediately become powerless and ineffective. Therefore, I hope that all labor model comrades will not be satisfied with the existing work achievements, but will continue to improve, add to your achievements, and always maintain the title of labor model. At the same time, in your work, you must play a "leading role, backbone role, and bridge role" as Chairman Mao said. You must teach others what you have learned, and create thousands of heroes from one hero. And vigorously spread and promote the creations and inventions of these heroes and models, so that good experiences can quickly become the experiences of the whole factory, station, section, and the whole railway, so that everyone can quickly improve their work after learning new work methods. For example, Li Shusen and Zhu Shiqing and other comrades of the Harbin Railway Factory actively learned from the advanced Soviet experiences and first promoted the Kovalev's work method. Fifty-eight pieces have been implemented, increasing efficiency by an average of more than two times, with the highest reaching seven times. Zhang Huaiyu, a young foundry worker at the Jinan Railway Factory, transformed his tools, increasing the number of brake shoes produced from 15 per day in the past to 160 per day, setting a national record. Sun Lianwang of the Tangshan Railway Factory transformed the heavy oil copper furnace, saving 130 million yuan in oil consumption each year. Since Li Xikui's shunting method was developed at the Shenyang Station, the Shenyang Branch and the Trade Union of the China Changchun Railway, under the advocacy of Soviet experts, vigorously promoted it, held a demonstration conference of the Li Xikui shunting team, and held a training class on Li Xikui's advanced method. The shunting experience of the Li Xikui team was quickly applied by four teams at the station, and new creations were made. The number of trains handled increased from a maximum of 13 per shift to 17. As a result of the vigorous promotion by the Shenyang Station, the shunting work took on a new look, and the work efficiency of the entire station's shunting team increased by more than 60 percent. In June alone, more than 23,000 tons of goods were transported. The Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway used Kovalev's advanced work methods and paid attention to cultivating labor models. From December 1950 to July of this year, in more than seven months, six new records were created. After Zheng Xikun's Youth locomotive team set a new record of over-axle traction of 4,174.3 tons (the standard is 2,000 tons), the 75th team of the section set a new record of 4,530.5 tons of traction. This year, during the "May 1st" holiday, the Yan Hairu team set a record of 5,404.7 tons of over-axle traction, and the Wang Kequan team set a new record of 5,525.1 tons of over-axle traction. In July, the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot saw the 1184 locomotive of He Yupei over-axle traction of 5,613 tons, and even the Du Shide team over-axle traction breaking 6,000 tons, creating the highest national record.

Therefore, we must pay attention to constantly promoting new work methods in our work, constantly cultivating labor models, cultivating and promoting worker cadres. Only by constantly emerging new labor models and new leading backbones can our railway cause develop further.

Since the liberation of the country, more than 12,400 outstanding workers in the national railway system have been promoted to cadres in the railway enterprise management departments and railway trade unions at all levels. Many of them have also assumed important leadership positions. For example, among the 8,007 cadres promoted successively in the Northeast Railway system, one-third of them hold positions as trade union chairmen and section chiefs, section chiefs, and station masters of the Railway Administration. Wang Baorang and Hao Zuoxin, old workers of the Jilin Railway Administration, were promoted to deputy directors of the Vehicle Department and the Locomotive Department of the Administration. Li Yong, the driver of the nationally renowned model locomotive "Mao Zedong," and young worker Wang Xuezeng were elected as vice chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union.

Many of these cadres promoted from workers are veteran workers who have worked on the railway for decades (such as Wang Yongxiang, a labor model of the Hengyang Railway Bureau who is 70 years old and was promoted from iron worker foreman to deputy director of the engineering section). They all have rich work experience and are generally very competent. In the past, under the rule of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang, their talents were always buried, and now they have been given full opportunities to play their roles.

After a large number of outstanding workers were promoted to cadres to manage state-owned enterprises, the general workers also further realized the position of the working class as masters of the country, and everyone strengthened their sense of responsibility and improved their work efficiency.

In terms of employee welfare, more than 480,000 employees and 1.4 million family members of employees in the national railway have enjoyed labor insurance benefits. According to statistics from six administrations in the customs in 1950: the labor insurance premiums paid throughout the year reached 28 billion yuan, and the payments for employee medical care, uniform allowances, year-end double salaries, attendance bonuses, educational subsidies for employees' children, and other benefits totaled 222.9 billion yuan. In terms of safety and health equipment: 28.4 billion yuan has been spent in 1951 to improve health protection and safety equipment. Therefore, employee casualties have been greatly reduced. For example, from January to April 1950, the number of casualties among direct production employees accounted for 0.88 percent of the total number of employees, while from January to April 1951, it was reduced to 0.47 percent. In the old society, workers were treated as cattle and horses by the ruling class, and people were not as valuable as machines. Only in the new society are workers valued, so many casualties have been reduced. In addition, collective labor insurance undertakings have also been established: there are 30 sanatoriums and convalescent homes, including 24 part-time ones, and several are under construction. In 1950 alone, 3,600 labor models in the Northeast region went to sanatoriums for recuperation. According to statistics for the first half of 1951, there were 219,809 people participating in part-time cultural studies and 236,510 people participating in political studies nationwide. It can be seen here that only by living in the Mao Zedong era can our working class be the masters of the country, have their lives guaranteed, have opportunities to study, and improve their cultural and political levels, so as to better serve the people.

Although our work has achieved great success, there are still many shortcomings to be overcome. Therefore, we must never be arrogant or complacent. The Resist America and Aid Korea is still continuing, and the tasks given by the country are very arduous. The task of the railway has been increased by 20 percent in the second half of this year. With the efforts of all 540,000 employees and under the leadership of all labor models, we are confident that we can complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the country. For the needs of the country's economic construction and national defense, I can tell you that the tasks that the country will give us next year will be even more important than this year. For example, the number of standard-gauge loaded wagons is required to increase by 18.4 percent compared to the expected completion number this year. The freight car turnaround time is required to be shortened by 4 percent compared to this year's plan. The daily mileage of freight car locomotives is required to be increased by 4.3 percent compared to this year. The technical speed is required to be increased by 3.2 percent compared to this year. The freight car locomotive turnaround time is required to be shortened by 6.7 percent compared to this year. The rate of defective locomotives is required to be reduced to 22 percent. The standard for locomotive coal consumption for the next year is required to be reduced by 7.5 percent compared to this year's standard. The number of locomotives and vehicles to be repaired and manufactured is: 110 locomotives, 7,000 freight cars, and 125 passenger cars. In order to improve the efficiency of locomotive and vehicle utilization, we must ensure that the number of days in the factory is shortened and eliminate major rework; in electrical work, we must strive to eliminate liability accidents; and the new line projects of Chengdu-Chongqing and Tianshui-Lanzhou will continue to be built forward. This glorious and arduous task, I hope that all employees will work hard to overcome all difficulties, continue to carry forward their initiative and creativity, and strive to overfulfill the task. To this end, all labor models are required to give fuller play to your wisdom and talents, develop rationalization proposals, and create new record movements. Economically use vehicles, shorten turnaround time, and improve technical speed, especially to improve technical and political levels, so that everyone is proficient in technology and understands politics. Only by improving politics and mastering technology can we better manage state-owned enterprises. At the same time, in order to implement the economic accounting system, everyone must study how to improve production efficiency, improve work quality, tap the potential capacity of the railway, overcome waste, strive for economy, reduce costs, and strive for profits, so as to accumulate more funds for the country. Comrades, let us work hard to meet and complete new glorious tasks, and to increase the strength of our great motherland's national defense and economic construction!

    在全国铁路劳动模范代表大会上
    滕代远部长的讲话各位劳动模范同志们！
    人民铁道第一次召开的全国劳动模范代表大会开幕了，我预祝这个大会的胜利成功。
    大会的召开，正在中华人民共和国成立后第二个国庆节的前夕，是有很大意义的。目前，全国除台湾外已经全部解放了，全国人民在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国主义运动中，一年来显示了我们强大的中国人民的力量是不可战胜的，美帝国主义的失败前途是注定了的。我们人民铁道自从解放以来，经过了抢修、修筑与补强，对于支援战争，进行物资交流，配合国家的经济建设与国防建设，起了它应有的作用。我们人民铁道，在各方面都有了很大的进步。回忆人民铁道的发展过程：是经过了民主的改革，进行了阶级教育，树立了职工的主人翁思想，进行了一连串的政治运动，组织了工会，建党、建团；在管理方面进行了一连串改革，调整机构，调整职薪，部分实行负责制，建立了工人代表会和管理委员会，实行了一些新的工作方法，统一了一些必要的制度；在这个基础上有了简单的全国生产计划，开展合理化建议，和新纪录运动，从本年七月一日起，全国各管理局已实行经济核算制。
    这些制度的改革与创建，在旧中国是根本没有而且也不可能实行的。因为有了统一的制度，统一计划，加上路线的修整，机车质量的增强，运输业务的改进，以及解放后全体职工政治觉悟的提高，因此在工作效率上也有了飞跃的进步；一九五一年上半年运输任务提前三点七天完成了。装车数较去年同一时期每昼夜多装一万九千九百八十三吨。一九五○年全国铁路运输货物的延吨公里计算，比一九三五年提高了百分之五一○点六，一九五一年上半年又比去年同时期提高了百分之五十点二。一九五○年运送旅客以延人公里计算，比一九三五年提高了百分之三八三点二。今年上半年比去年同时期提高了百分之三点九。今年的水害阻断行车时间，比去年减少了百分之六十。在全国各地超轴运动不断创造新纪录的情况下，一九五一年上半年全国的货物列车牵引吨数，较一九五○年提高了百分之三点四，比一九四一年伪满时期东北铁路提高了百分之十三点一，货物列车旅行速度，一九五一年上半年，每小时平均比一九五○年提高百分之五点七，东北铁路上半年度平均每小时二十四公里，比一九四三年伪满时期提高了百分之二十。直通主要旅客列车速度亦在不断地提高：上海至广州直通快车，现已缩短为五十小时零十三分钟，比一九五○年一月十日开始直通时六十四小时，缩减十三小时零四十七分，冬季改点还可缩短三小时四十五分。满洲里至北京直通快车，已缩短为五十五小时零五十九分，较一九四九年开始时五十九小时零六分，缩短三小时零七分，冬季改点还可缩短六小时二十二分。北京至上海直通快车，缩短为三十六小时零十七分，较一九三七年初平沪通车三十七小时零四十分，缩短了一小时零二十三分，较一九四九年七月开始时四十五小时零三十五分，缩短了九小时十八分，冬季改点还可缩短一小时五十七分。冬季改点后，北京至汉口直通车七次全程旅行三十二小时三十七分，缩短了四小时十八分。货物机车日车公里，一九五一年度上半年全国平均实绩三五五点六公里，较一九五○年提高了百分之五点六公里，比一九四三年伪满时期东北铁路机车日车公里提高了百分之五十点七公里。
    今年新建的铁路工程有：成渝、天兰、来镇三条，共长六百七十公里。我们修路的成绩，是超过了旧中国历史上的任何一年。据统计：中国在一九二七年以前四十八年中，共修筑铁路九五七二公里，平均每年修一九九公里，一九二八年到一九四一年，十三年中增修五七○八公里，平均每年修路也不过四四○公里（上述数字，不包括外人投资的南满、中东、滇越等路，及“九一八”后，日寇在中国所修的铁路）。
    上述这些成绩的获得，这是由于毛主席的英明领导，各地党和政府的协助和指导，和苏联专家对我们的帮助和指导，以及五十四万铁路员工的努力，特别是与在座的诸位劳动模范的努力是分不开的。你们在各种工作岗位上，以国家主人翁的态度，发挥了极大的勇敢、智慧和积极性，有了很多的创造和发明，开展合理化的建议，展开生产竞赛，创造新纪录，使我们的人民铁道有了日新而月异的进步，你们应该受到人民的尊敬和国家的尊重。
    每个劳动模范，都有自己的光荣的事迹，为时间所限，我不能一一例举。据统计去年铁路系统的劳动模范，共有两万多名，志愿参加抗美援朝的铁路职工及铁道兵团指战员，半年来共有百分之八十五以上的人立了功。你们在座的五百位劳动模范同志们，只是这许多劳动模范的代表。
    这次大会的目的，是要交流经验，互相学习，提高一步，以便今后把我们铁路上的各种工作做得更好一些。大家必须以学习的精神来参加大会。人民的英雄，是从群众中产生出来的，必须联系群众，团结群众，必须虚心向群众学习，接受技术知识，集中群众的经验和智慧，然后才能领导他们，推动他们前进。去年全国工农兵劳动模范大会上，毛主席宣读中共中央的祝词曾说过：战斗英雄和劳动模范应当：
    “继续在战斗中学习，向广大人民群众学习。只有决不骄傲自满并且继续不疲倦地学习，才能够对于伟大的中华人民共和国继续作出优异的供献，并从而继续保持你们的光荣称号。”英雄如果骄傲自满，必然脱离群众，英雄如果脱离群众，立刻就变得没有力量，没有作用了。因此我希望各位劳动模范同志们，不要满足于现有的工作成绩，要继续提高，功上加功，永远保持劳动模范的称号。同时在工作中必须按照毛主席所说的，要起“带头作用，骨干作用和桥梁作用”。必须把自己所学会的本事，教会别人，从一个英雄，产生出千万个英雄。而把这些英雄和模范的创造发明，大力地予以传播和推广，这样才能使好的经验很快地成为全厂全站全段及全路的经验，使大家在学习了新的工作方法之后，很快地也能把工作提高一步。如哈尔滨铁路工厂李树森、朱世清等同志，积极地学习了苏联先进经验，首先推行郭瓦廖夫的工作方法，已实行了五十八件，提高效率平均在二倍以上，最高的达到七倍。济南铁路工厂青年翻砂工张怀玉改造工具，由过去每天造十五箱闸瓦提高到每天一六○箱的全国纪录。唐山铁路工厂孙连旺，改造重油化铜炉，每年节省油的消耗达人民币一亿三千万元。沈阳车站自从产生了李锡奎的调车方法以后，中长路沈阳分局及工会在苏联专家倡导下，即大力推广，举行李锡奎调车组示范大会，举办李锡奎先进方法训练班，李锡奎小组的调车经验，很快就被该站四个小组运用了，并有了新的创造，从一班最多办理十三列车增加到十七列车，沈阳站大力推行的结果，调车工作面貌一新，全站调车组工作效率提高了百分之六十以上，仅六月份就多运货物两万三千多吨。中长路苏家屯机务段，运用了郭瓦廖夫的先进工作方法，注意培养劳动模范，从一九五○年十二月起到今年七月止，七个多月的时间，产生了六次新纪录。从郑锡坤的青年号机车包乘组创超轴牵引四一七四点三吨新纪录以后（规定标准是两千吨），接着该段产生了七五号包乘组牵引四五三○点五吨的新纪录，今年“五一”又产生了阎海儒包乘组五四○四点七吨，和王克全包乘组的五五二五点一吨超轴牵引新纪录，七月间苏家屯机务段出现了一一八四号机车何玉佩超轴牵引五六一三吨，更出现了杜世德包乘组超轴牵引突破六千吨，创造了全国的最高纪录。
    因此，我们必须注意：在工作中去不断地提倡新的工作方法，不断地培养劳动模范，培养和提拔工人干部，只有不断地出现新的劳动模范，新的领导骨干，我们的铁道事业，才能更进一步地向前发展。
    自全国解放以来，全国铁路系统中已有一万二千四百余位优秀工人，被提拔为铁路企业管理部门及各级铁路工会的干部。其中许多人且已担负了重要的领导工作，例如东北区铁路系统先后提拔起来的八千零七个干部中，就有三分之一担负着工会主席及铁路管理局的科长、段长、站长等职务。吉林铁路管理局老工人王宝让和郝作新并被提拔为该局车辆处副处长和机务处副处长。全国闻名的模范机车“毛泽东号”司机长李永及青年工人王学增，更被选任为中国铁路工会全国委员会的副主席。
    这些从工人中提拔起来的干部，有很多是铁路上工作了几十年的老工人（如衡阳局劳动模范王永祥年高七十，由铁工班长被提拔为工务段副段长）。他们都有丰富的工作经验，因而一般的都很称职。过去在日伪、国民党统治下，他们的才能始终被埋没，现在才得到了充分发挥的机会。
    大批优秀工人被提拔为管理国家企业的干部后，一般工人群众，也从而进一步体会到工人阶级的国家主人翁地位，大家加强了工作责任心，提高了工作效率。
    在职工的福利方面，全国铁路已有四十八万余职工和一百四十余万职工家属享受了劳动保险待遇。一九五○年据关内六个管理局统计：支付的劳动保险费全年达二百八十亿元，支付职工医药、制服津贴、年终双薪、考勤奖金、职工子女教育补助费及其他福利等，共达两千二百二十九亿元。在安全卫生设备上：一九五一年已开支二百八十四亿元，用于改善卫生保护安全诸设备。因此职工的伤亡大为减少，如一九五○年一月至四月，直接生产职工伤亡人数占总人数百分之零点八八，一九五一年一月至四月则减为百分之零点四七。旧社会的工人被统治阶级当作牛马，人不如机器宝贵，只有在新社会，工人才被看重，因此减少了许多伤亡。此外还建立了集体劳动保险事业：休养所，疗养院共三十处，其中业余的二十四处，正在建筑中的若干处。一九五○年仅东北地区就有三千六百劳动模范，到疗养院休养。据一九五一年上半年统计，参加业余文化学习的人全国共有二一九、八○九名，参加政治学习的有二三六、五一○人。这里可以看到：只有生活在毛泽东时代，我们工人阶级才能当家作主人，生活才有了保障，才有了学习的机会，文化与政治水平才能得到提高，才能更好的为人民服务。
    我们的工作虽然有很大的成就，但也还有许多缺点有待克服。因此，我们绝不能骄傲自满。抗美援朝还在继续进行，国家给予的任务是很艰巨的，今年下半年又增加我们铁路原有任务的百分之二十，在全体五十四万员工努力下，在全体劳动模范带头之下，我们有信心可以完成国家所交给的光荣任务。为了整个国家的经济建设与国防上的需要，可以告诉大家：明年国家给我们的任务将比今年更为重大，例如准轨装车数要求比今年预计完成数增加百分之十八点四，货车周转时间，要求比今年计划缩短百分之四，货车机车日车公里，要求比今年提高百分之四点三，技术速度要求比今年提高百分之三点二，货车机车周转时间，要求比今年缩短百分之六点七，不良机车率，要求缩减到百分之二十二，明年度机车用煤标准，要求比今年标准降低百分之七点五，修造机车车辆计：机车一百十台，货车七千辆，客车一百二十五辆。为了提高机车车辆运用效率，我们必须保证缩短在厂日数，消灭重大反手活；在电务工作上，要求争取消灭责任事故；而新线工程成渝、天兰两线继续向前兴修，这个光荣而艰巨的任务，希望全体职工努力克服一切困难，继续发扬积极性与创造性，争取超额完成任务。为此，要求全体劳动模范更高的发挥你们的智慧和天才，开展合理化建议，创造新纪录运动。经济使用车辆，缩短周转时间，提高技术速度，特别是要提高技术与政治的水平，使每个人既精通技术又懂得政治。只有政治提高了，掌握了技术，才能更好地管理国家企业，同时为着实行经济核算制，大家必须研究如何提高生产效率，提高工作质量，发挥铁路的潜在能力，克服浪费，力求节约，降低成本，争取利润，为国家更多地累集资金。同志们，为迎接与完成新的光荣任务，为增加我们伟大的祖国的国防经济建设力量而努力奋斗吧！
