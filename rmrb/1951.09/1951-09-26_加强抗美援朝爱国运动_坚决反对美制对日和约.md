    Strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Patriotic Movement
    Resolutely Oppose the U.S.-Made Separate Peace Treaty with Japan

    (I) To the Editors:
    We are a group of recuperating wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. We read in the newspapers about the illegal San Francisco conference manipulated by the United States and the signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan. Our anger is uncontrollable.

    It is unacceptable for the United States to exclude China and the Soviet Union, two major countries, and to tear up international agreements to illegally sign a peace treaty with Japan. The United States not only openly stipulated in this illegal "treaty" the revival of Japanese militarism and the intensification of arming Japan, but also妄想 to occupy our Taiwan and divide our motherland's territory for a long time! We are determined to oppose this to the end!

    The signing of the separate U.S. "peace treaty" with Japan shows that the U.S. imperialist war plan has moved forward another step, thus seriously threatening peace and security in the Far East. Our people must unite more closely around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, heighten our vigilance, intensify preparations, and consolidate national defense. On the one hand, we must strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, strive for economic construction, and consolidate our great motherland; on the other hand, we must strive to donate airplanes, tanks, and cannons, intensify the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, support the front lines, and give U.S. imperialism an even greater blow. We firmly believe that the Chinese people, who have already achieved great revolutionary victories, united with the peace-loving people of the world, will surely defeat the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism!

    (II) To the Editors:
    The crimes of U.S. imperialism in violating international agreements, manipulating the San Francisco conference, and illegally signing a separate peace treaty with Japan have aroused the infinite anger of the peasants of Nanqijia Village, Changping County, Hebei Province, who suffered the most from the burning, killing, and persecution of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. At noon on September 12, the villagers held a mass meeting to discuss taking practical actions to oppose U.S. imperialism's separate peace with Japan. After a cadre reported, everyone spoke up. Kou Changgui, a military dependent, said to everyone:

    "We have achieved victory after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and three years of the Liberation War, and we have implemented land reform. My family has been allocated houses, land, and donkeys, and has also married a daughter-in-law. Our lives have improved. We will never allow U.S. imperialism to rearm Japan and invade China again. I must take practical actions to strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. I hoed the land twice more this year than last year, and my 39 acres of land yielded 1,000 more catties of corn. I donated 50,000 yuan before. Now I have decided to increase my donation by 500 catties of old corn. To protect my home and defend my country, I will use all my strength to support the front lines and consolidate the defense of our motherland." Then, everyone donated 100 catties, 200 catties... In less than half an hour, 67 households voluntarily increased their donation of corn by 2,090 catties, worth 1,024,000 yuan.

    That night, everyone held a forum to denounce the crimes of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, expressing their determination not to allow such disasters to recur. At the meeting, some people increased their donations. In this way, all 226 households and more than 900 people in the village donated a total of more than 11,100,000 yuan before and after, averaging more than 11,000 yuan per person. This village is not a wealthy village, but the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to arm Japan and expand aggression aroused the great anger of the peasants. They enthusiastically donated to oppose the U.S. separate peace with Japan and to resist America and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country.

    (III) To the Editors:
    U.S. imperialism's manipulation of the San Francisco conference and illegal signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan has made us very angry. This unreasonable and absurd action by U.S. imperialism has once again exposed its vicious face.

    This illegal "treaty," which was not attended by the People's Republic of China, which fought against Japan for the longest time and sacrificed the most, will not work even if U.S. imperialism and its satellite countries sign it. We, the Chinese people, will never recognize it.

    We pledge to implement the patriotic pact, do our practical work well, strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, and work with the people of the whole country to fight against the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism!

    (IV) To the Editors:
    U.S. imperialism openly disregards the due right of the People's Republic of China, which has the longest time fighting against Japan, the greatest sacrifice, and the greatest contribution, to speak on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, and tears up previous international agreements, manipulating its satellite countries to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan. This "treaty" infringes upon China's sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, denies the legitimate rights of Asian countries to demand compensation from Japan, suppresses the democratic movement of the Japanese people, and revives Japanese militarism, making it a tool for U.S. imperialism to invade Asia, thereby expanding the war of aggression and undermining world peace. Therefore, the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan is not a peace treaty at all, but a war treaty that endangers peace. This U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan, which was not signed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries, is completely illegal and therefore invalid.

    We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on August 15, and we support the speech of Soviet representative Gromyko at the San Francisco conference.

    The Chinese people have stood up. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, every Chinese person is contributing their strength to the motherland. We technicians are determined to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, overcome purely technical viewpoints, do a good job in the economic construction of the motherland, respond to the government's call, strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea patriotic movement, and take practical actions to defeat the aggressive schemes of U.S. imperialism!

### 加强抗美援朝爱国运动  坚决反对美制对日和约

    加强抗美援朝爱国运动
    坚决反对美制对日和约
    （一）编辑同志：
    我们是一群正在休养中的志愿军伤病员。我们在报上读到美国操纵的非法的旧金山会议，签订单独对日和约的消息，我们的愤怒是无法抑制的。
    美国排斥中苏两大国家，撕毁国际协定，非法签订对日“和约”，这是不能容许的。美国不只在这个非法的“和约”中公开规定了复活日本军国主义，加紧武装日本，而且妄想长期占领我国的台湾，分割我们祖国的领土！这是我们坚决反对到底的！
    美国单独对日“和约”的签订，表明美帝国主义的战争计划更向前推进了一步，因而严重地威胁着远东的和平与安全。我们全国人民必须更加紧密地团结在共产党和毛主席的周围，提高警惕，加紧准备，巩固国防。一方面要加强人民民主专政，努力经济建设，巩固我们伟大的祖国；一方面要努力捐献飞机坦克大炮，加紧抗美援朝，支援前线，给美帝国主义以更大的打击。我们坚信，已经取得伟大的革命胜利的中国人民，和全世界爱好和平的人民团结一起，必能打败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋！

                （二）编辑同志：
    美帝国主义破坏国际协定，操纵旧金山会议，非法签订单独对日和约的罪行，激起了遭受日寇与蒋介石匪帮烧杀迫害最甚的河北昌平县南七家安全村农民的无限愤怒。九月十二日中午，该村农民开了群众大会，讨论用实际行动来反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和。一位干部报告后，大家就起来讲话。军属寇常贵向大家说：
    “我们经过八年抗日战争，三年解放战争，得到了胜利，实行了土地改革。我家分到了房子、土地和毛驴，还娶了儿媳妇，生活改善了。我们决不允许美帝国主义重新武装日本，再来侵略我们中国。我一定要用实际行动加强抗美援朝。我今年比去年多锄了两遍地，三十九亩地增产了一千斤玉米。我从前捐献了五万元。现在我决定增加捐献五百斤老玉米。为了保家卫国，我要用一切力量来支援前线，巩固我们祖国的国防。”接着，大家你一百斤我二百斤地捐献起来。不到半个钟头，就有六十七户自动增加捐献玉米二千零九十斤，款一百零两万四千元。
    那天晚上，大家又举行了座谈会，控诉日寇与蒋介石匪帮的罪行，表示决不允许这种灾祸重演。在会上又有人增加捐献。这样，全村二百二十六户、九百多人口，前后共捐献了一千一百余万元，每人达一万一千多元。这个村并不是富裕的村子，但是美帝国主义要武装日本与扩大侵略的阴谋，激起了农民们的极大愤怒。他们踊跃捐献，用实际的行动来反对美国单独对日媾和与抗美援朝保家卫国。

    （三）编辑同志：
    美帝国主义操纵旧金山会议，非法签订单独对日和约，使我们非常愤慨。美帝国主义这种横蛮无理与荒谬绝伦的行动，再一次暴露了它的凶恶的面目。
    这个没有对日作战最久、牺牲最大的中华人民共和国参加的非法“和约”，即使美帝国主义及其仆从国家在上面签字了，也起不了作用，我们中国人民决不承认。
    我们保证执行爱国公约，做好实际工作，加强抗美援朝，与全国人民一起，为打败美帝国主义的阴谋而奋斗！

   （四）编辑同志：
    美帝国主义公然无视对日作战时间最久、牺牲最大、贡献最多的中华人民共和国在对日和约问题上应有的发言权，并撕毁历次国际协定，操纵它的仆从国家，签订了单独的对日和约。这一“和约”侵犯了中国在台湾与澎湖列岛的主权，否定了亚洲各国对日本要求赔偿的正当权利，压制日本人民的民主运动，复活日本军国主义，使其成为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的工具，进而扩大侵略战争，破坏世界和平。所以美制对日和约，根本不是和平条约，而是危害和平的战争条约。这个没有苏联与中华人民共和国及亚洲其他国家签字的美制单独对日和约，完全是非法的，因而也是无效的。
    我们坚决拥护八月十五日周外长的声明，我们拥护苏联代表葛罗米柯在旧金山会议上的发言。
    中国人民已经站起来了。在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，每一个中国人民都在为祖国贡献出自己的力量。我们技术人员坚决学习苏联的先进经验，克服单纯技术观点，搞好祖国的经济建设，响应政府号召，加强抗美援朝爱国运动，以实际行动来击败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋！
