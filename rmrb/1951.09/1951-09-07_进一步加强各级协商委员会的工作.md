    Further Strengthening the Work of Consultation Committees at All Levels

    The Secretaries-General Conference of the Provincial and Municipal Consultation Committees across the country passed five proposals on strengthening the work of local consultation committees at all levels from late April to early May this year (see today's newspaper). These were amended and approved by the 25th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in July this year. Those to be suggested to the Central People's Government were also discussed and promulgated by the 96th Administrative Council Meeting of the Central People's Government. Because these documents are summarized from practical work experience, their promulgation and implementation will make the working direction of consultation committees at all levels clearer, enrich the working content of consultation committees at all levels, and advance the country's democratic construction work a big step forward.

    Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his speech to the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing: "The system of People's Representative Conferences and People's Congresses is the basic system of our country and the best basic organizational form of the people's democratic power." This is far superior to the old democratic system of the bourgeoisie. In order to establish and consolidate this system throughout our country, we must do a lot of work; and further enriching the work of consultation committees at all levels is an important part of it. We must proceed from the actual situation of the political life of the majority of the Chinese people, gradually do a good job in various preparatory work, so that the current people's representative conferences at all levels can fully competently exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress, and create complete conditions for the establishment of the people's congress.

    Who will do the various preparatory work? In addition to the people's governments and the people's representative conferences at all levels themselves, the consultation committees at all levels must also play an extremely important role. In particular, the quality of work of the consultation committees at all levels is closely related to whether the people's representative conferences at all levels can be held well. On the one hand, the consultation committees at all levels should assist the people's governments, contact the people, reflect the opinions of the people, and mobilize the people to promote policies and decrees; on the other hand, they should strengthen the unity of the democratic parties, people's organizations, and other democratic人士, unite and educate the entire people of all democratic classes through them, to further consolidate the foundation of the people's government and expand its representation. Therefore, in order to adapt to the requirements of national democratic political construction, it is extremely necessary for the consultation committees at all levels to clarify their working direction, enrich their working content, and strengthen their institutional activities.

    Some people once thought that the consultation committee was an organ of political power, an administrative or legislative organ, and should establish its vertical system from the central to the local level; some people believed that the relationship between the consultation committee and the democratic parties and people's organizations should be a leadership relationship; some people regarded the consultation committee as a subordinate organ of government departments; some people believed that the consultation committee was an optional and insignificant institution. In the past, because these erroneous understandings were not corrected, the relationship between the consultation committee and all parties was also confused. The specific manifestation of the shortcomings in the work was that some local consultation committees lacked planning, initiative, and regular comprehensive work. Regarding these issues, the "Opinions on the Work of the People's Representative Conference Consultation Committees of Provinces and Municipalities" clearly pointed out that "The consultation committee is a political consultation organ of the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic人士, and it is also a united front organization that unites all democratic classes through the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic人士." The "General Rules of Organization of the People's Representative Conference Consultation Committees of Provinces and Municipalities" more clearly stipulates the duties of the consultation committee and its specific relationship with the upper and lower levels.

    From this, it can be recognized that the consultation committee itself is an organ for consultation and suggestions. It is neither an administrative or legislative organ nor a subordinate department of a government organ. There is no leadership relationship between it and the people's government at the same level. At the same time, the consultation committee is also a political consultation organization of the united front. All parties, organizations, and individuals participating in the consultation organ are politically bound by the Common Program and various agreements, and must not violate them; but organizationally, they each maintain their independence. Therefore, the relationship between the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the democratic parties and people's organizations is also a consultative relationship, not a direct leadership relationship. Similarly, based on the aforementioned nature of the consultation committee, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has no guidance or subordination relationship with the local consultation committees at all levels and with each other, except for the provincial and municipal consultation committees designated by the National Committee to exercise the functions and powers of the local committees. Therefore, the "Decision on the Relationship of Local Consultation Committees at All Levels" passed by the Central People's Government clearly stipulates that only the relationship of exchanging experiences and mutual suggestions can be established between consultation committees at all levels other than those exercising the functions and powers of the local committees. It can be seen that the consultation committee is one of the specific organizational forms of the united front, and it is completely adapted to the characteristics of China's new democratic revolution.

    Due to the increasingly broad and expanded requirements of the united front as manifested by objective circumstances, the work of strengthening the unity and progress of the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic人士, and uniting and educating the people of all democratic classes through them, must be expanded from the provincial and municipal consultation committees to the standing committees of the county people's representative conferences. Therefore, the supplementary provisions issued by the Administrative Council of the Central People's Government stipulate that the county standing committees should "be responsible for carrying out the county people's democratic united front work." This is timely and necessary. Secondly, in order to closely connect the government with the people, widely solicit the opinions of the people, and appropriately handle the demands put forward by the people to the government, answer the people's letters, and meet the people in a convenient way, it should not only be the responsibility of the people's governments at all levels, but also the responsibility of the consultation committees at all levels. The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has specifically formulated the "Trial Measures of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative and the Provincial and Municipal Consultation Committees on Handling People's Opinions," which is also of great significance.

    These documents are all experiences summarized from past practical work. These documents not only clearly stipulate the working direction and tasks of the consultation committee, but also stipulate its specific working content. This will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the development of the work of the consultation committees at all levels, and will also play a great role in promoting the construction of the country's basic system.

    At present, all localities are working hard to strengthen the construction of people's democratic power. We believe that further strengthening the work of consultation committees at all levels is also an important part of it. In the process of inspecting the construction of political power, all localities should also conduct inspections on the work of consultation committees at all levels (including the standing committees of counties) based on these documents promulgated by the Central People's Government, so as to improve the existing shortcomings and make our people's democratic system more sound and consolidated.

### 进一步加强各级协商委员会的工作

    进一步加强各级协商委员会的工作
    本年四月下旬至五月上旬，全国各省、市协商委员会秘书长会议通过了五个关于加强地方各级协商委员会工作的建议案（见今日本报），并于本年七月经中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会第二十五次会议修正通过；其中应向中央人民政府建议者，亦经中央人民政府政务院第九十六次政务会议讨论通过颁布施行。由于这些文件是从实际工作经验中总结出来的，它的颁布实施，将使各级协商委员会的工作方向更加明确起来，使各级协商委员会的工作内容更加丰富，使国家的民主建政工作，更向前推进一大步。
    刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议的讲话中指出：“人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度，是我们国家的基本制度，是人民民主政权最好的基本的组织形式。”这是比资产阶级的旧民主制度要远为优越的。为了在我们全国范围内建立并巩固这种制度，我们还必须做许多工作；而进一步充实各级协商委员会的工作，就是其中重要的一部分。我们必须从中国大多数人民政治生活的实际情况出发，逐步地做好各种准备工作，使目前各级人民代表会议都能够充分胜任地代行人民代表大会职权，并为人民代表大会的建立，创造完备的条件。
    由谁来作好各种准备工作呢？除了各级人民政府和各级人民代表会议自身以外，各级协商委员会也要起着极其重要的作用。特别是各级协商委员会工作的好坏，对于各级人民代表会议能否开好是有很密切的关系的。各级协商委员会一方面要协助人民政府，联系人民群众，反映人民群众的意见，并动员人民群众推行政策法令；另一方面又应加强各民主党派、人民团体和其他民主人士的团结，经过他们去团结与教育各民主阶级的全体人民，以进一步巩固人民政府的基础并扩大其代表性。因此，各级协商委员会的工作，为着适应国家民主政权建设的要求，明确其工作方向，充实其工作内容，加强其机构活动，是极其必要的。
    有人曾以为协商委员会是政权机关，是行政或立法的机关，并应从中央到地方建立其垂直系统；有的认为协商委员会对各民主党派和人民团体的关系，应该是领导关系；有的将协商委员会看成政府部门的隶属机关；有的认为协商委员会是一种可有可无、无足轻重的机构。过去由于这些错误的认识没有被纠正，因此，对协商委员会与各方面的关系，也混淆不清，而具体表现于工作中的缺点，便是某些地方协商委员会缺乏计划性、主动性和没有经常的全面的工作。对这些问题，“关于各省、市各界人民代表会议协商委员会工作的意见”这个文件，就明确指出“协商委员会是各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士的政治协商机关，又是经过各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士去团结各民主阶级的统一战线组织。”“省、市各界人民代表会议协商委员会组织通则”更明确地规定了协商委员会的职务及其对上对下的具体关系。
    由此便可以认识到，协商委员会本身是协商建议的机关。它既不是行政或立法机关，也不是政府机关的隶属部门。它与同级人民政府之间互无领导的关系。同时，协商委员会又是统一战线的政治协商组织。一切参加协商机关的党派、团体和个人，在政治上都受共同纲领与各种协议的约束，不得违反；但在组织上，则各自保持其独立性。因此，人民政协全国委员会对各民主党派和人民团体的关系，也是协商关系，而不是直接领导的关系。同样，基于上述协商委员会的性质，人民政协全国委员会对地方各级协商委员会及其相互之间，除全国委员会指定的代行地方委员会职权的省、市协商委员会以外，彼此也没有指导或隶属的关系。因此，中央人民政府通过的“关于地方各级协商委员会的关系的决定”中，明确规定代行地方委员会职权以外的各级协商委员会之间，只能建立交换经验和互相建议的关系。由此可见，协商委员会是统一战线的具体组织形式之一，是完全适应于中国新民主主义革命特点的。
    由于客观情况所表现的统一战线日益广泛与扩大的要求，加强各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士的团结与进步，并经过他们去团结与教育各民主阶级人民群众的工作，必须由省、市协商委员会扩大到县的各界人民代表会议的常务委员会。因此，中央人民政府政务院所发布的补充规定，即规定县常务委员会要“负责进行县人民民主统一战线工作”。这是适时的和必要的。其次，为了密切政府与人民群众的联系，广泛地征集人民群众的意见，并适当地处理人民向政府所提出的要求，答复人民群众的来信，并用方便的方法来接见人民群众，不仅应成为各级人民政府的责任，而且也应成为各级协商委员会的责任。此次人民政协全国委员会常务委员会特拟订“中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会暨省、市协商委员会关于处理人民意见的试行办法”也是有重大意义的。
    这些文件，都是从过去实际工作中总结出来的经验。这些文件不但明确地规定了协商委员会的工作方向与任务，而且也规定了它的工作具体内容。这对于各级协商委员会工作的开展，无疑是大有裨益的；对于国家基本制度的建设，亦将起着极大的推进作用。
    目前各地正努力加强人民民主政权的建设，我们认为进一步加强各级协商委员会的工作，也是重要的一环。各地在检查政权建设工作当中，还应该依据中央人民政府所颁布的这几项文件，对各级协商委员会（包括县的常务委员会）的工作，也进行检查，以便针对目前存在的某些缺点，力求改进，使我们的人民民主制度更加健全与巩固起来。
