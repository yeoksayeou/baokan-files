    Beijing - The twenty workers from various factories in Beijing participating in the third phase of recuperation at the Summer Palace wrote a letter to Peng Zhen, the Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, to thank the government for caring for their welfare. The original letter is as follows: Dear Mayor Peng:

    We are twenty worker comrades from various factories who are participating in the third phase of recuperation at the Summer Palace, and our recuperation period is coming to an end. In these few days, we have gained a lot both physically and mentally. Our weight has been increasing daily (the highest increase being five kilograms), and we feel very happy. At the same time, we also feel that in the past, the Summer Palace, which was built for the personal enjoyment of the feudal ruling class, was a place where working people could only sweat, be beaten, and be scolded. They could not eat enough or dress warmly, and they never had good days. The word "recuperation" was something they would never even dream of. But now, the Summer Palace has returned to the hands of the people, and we, the working class, can eat, live, and play here, taking turns recuperating for ten days. This is something unprecedented in our experience. We are very happy and very grateful. This victory is entirely due to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, achieved through thirty years of arduous struggle. Now that the country's construction is just beginning and national defense urgently needs to be strengthened, the government still cares for our welfare. Therefore, we can only bring the gains we have made in recuperation to all our fellow workers after returning to the factory, further unite everyone, improve and promote technology, step up production, and earnestly implement the patriotic pact, donate airplanes and artillery, defeat the aggression of American imperialism as soon as possible, and strive to realize the beautiful and happy society of our working class as soon as possible! We wish you good health.

    北京第三期在颐和园休养的工人写信给彭真市长
    感谢政府照顾工人的福利
    【本报讯】北京市各工厂参加颐和园第三期休养的二十个工人，写信给北京市人民政府彭真市长，感谢政府照顾他们的福利。原信如下：亲爱的彭市长：
    我们是由各工厂来参加颐和园第三期休养的二十个工人同志，现在休养就快期满了。在这几天里，我们的身体和精神都有很大的收获，体重逐日增加（最高的达五公斤），精神非常愉快。同时，我们又感觉到：过去为封建社会统治阶级个人所享受而建设的颐和园，劳动人民只能在这里流汗、挨打、受骂。他们吃不饱和穿不暖，终年没有好日子过，“休养”二字做梦也不会有；但是现在颐和园回到人民手里来了，我们工人阶级能够在这里吃、住、玩，轮流休养十日，这是我们经历过的空前未有的事。我们非常高兴，也非常感激。这种胜利果实，完全是靠党和毛主席英明的领导，经过三十年的艰苦斗争得来的。现在国家的建设事业正在开始，国防急需加以巩固，政府却仍然照顾到我们的福利。因此，我们只有在回厂后，把在休养中得到的收获带给全体职工同志，更进一步地团结大家，将技术提高和推广，加紧生产，并认真执行爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮，早日打垮美帝国主义的侵略，为争取早日实现我们工人阶级美好和幸福的社会而奋斗！祝您健康
