    Fujian, on the Forefront of National Coastal Defense
    Volunteer Army Returning Representative Dong Lefu
    In July, I visited the cities of Jianyang, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Tong'an, and Longyan in Fujian Province, as well as Houtian Village in Longyan County, a heroic village that has persisted in revolutionary struggle for more than twenty years. In more than twenty days, I saw the tremendous achievements made by the heroic people of Fujian in construction. They have basically eliminated bandits, severely suppressed counter-revolutionary activities, are implementing land reform in a systematic manner, and are tensely overcoming difficulties in a fighting posture, carrying out national defense, production, and other constructions. In particular, the moving examples that have emerged in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement are like the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army on the Korean front in battle; they are endless and inexhaustible to write about.
    On July 5th, when I arrived in Fuzhou, the people of Fuzhou were enthusiastically listening to the reports from the representatives of the delegation to North Korea to express sympathy and solicitude. Hearing that a representative of the returning Volunteer Army had arrived, they were even more excited. Comrades from all over came to me, requesting to meet me and listen to my report. They received me with the same feeling as treating their own children, brothers and sisters.
    In various parts of Fujian, I met with 260,000 comrades, and another 60,000 people listened to my broadcast. In Fuzhou, more than 30,000 representatives from various democratic parties, government agencies, troops, schools, and other sectors of society in Fujian, as well as more than 58,000 residents, women, and farmers, successively held grand welcoming rallies and met with me. Many farmers came from the suburbs twenty or thirty miles away. In Longyan, farmers from Houtian Village beat gongs and drums to welcome me six or seven miles away. In the villages I passed, the farmers happily set off firecrackers. From this, we can see the great concern and love of the people of the motherland for the Volunteer Army, and also their firm determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes and defend the country.
    During my work in Fujian, I saw the grand occasion of the comrades in various places enthusiastically launching the donation movement. Workers at the Fujian Highway Bureau Repair Factory, upon hearing that the Volunteer Army representative was coming, immediately used their spare time to repair three broken vehicles and donated the wages they earned for airplanes and cannons. Gao Fei, a worker in the lathe department of the Fujian Machine Factory, insisted on working even when he was ill after hearing the report. When the foreman asked him to rest, he replied: "We should dedicate everything when we increase production and make donations. Compared to the Volunteer Army in Korea, our hardships are far behind." Educators in Fuzhou originally planned to increase production and donate 90 million yuan in half a year, but now they have raised it to 240 million yuan. Women in Fuzhou originally decided to donate a fighter plane. When I left Fuzhou for Xiamen, they proposed: "We will complete the donation task when Representative Dong returns from Xiamen." On July 21st, they completed the donation plan, and by the 30th, the total amount of pledged donations reached 2.2 billion yuan. (The donated gold ornaments, real estate, etc. are not included). Many touching stories emerged during the donation movement. For example, Chen Mingzhen, a woman from Gulou District in Fuzhou, persuaded her mother-in-law to donate three houses. Zhou Jingchun, a woman from Shaoqiao District, carried a large load of scrap copper and iron to the District Women's Federation, including hundreds of copper coins and two silver coins she had collected from her home. She also took off a pair of gold earrings on the spot and donated them all together.
    In addition to enthusiastically donating airplanes and cannons, comrades in various places also donated many beloved items to comfort the Volunteer Army. A comrade from the Fuzhou Democratic Women's Federation donated a diary given to her by the mayor of Fuzhou. This was a gift she prepared to celebrate the publication of her husband's first book. Another female comrade donated a Jingdezhen small vase and a "North Pagoda" paperweight that she had treasured for eight years. In her letter to me, she wrote: "I didn't lose it even during the most difficult time of the Anti-Japanese War... I wanted to put it on the table when I live with my most beloved person in the future. Today, I feel that there is anyone in the world more lovely than you? You represent the hearts of the people and convey many vivid deeds of the Volunteer Army comrades. You are the person I admire the most. I want to give it to you..." Another woman took off a gold ring from her finger and asked me to bring it to Guo Zhongtian, a combat hero of the Volunteer Army. Elementary school students in Xiamen donated more than 300 pieces of their own artwork. Chen Shaokuan, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Resist America, Aid Korea Branch, sent four telescopes to the Volunteer Army. The most precious was the revolutionary souvenir donated by the farmers of Houtian Village in Longyan, an iron spear that was used in the uprising in 1929.
    According to incomplete statistics from the Fujian Provincial Resist America, Aid Korea Branch, during my time in Fujian, people from all over the province presented 193 banners to the Volunteer Army and more than 1,400 letters of condolence to the Volunteer Army. There were even more other items, with 3,300 pieces of gold ornaments, stationery, medicines, clothing, etc. in Fuzhou alone.
    I will always remember the letter written to me by a female comrade in Fuzhou: "Please be sure to bring my heart that loves the Volunteer Army to the front."
    Comrades in Fujian Province, I guarantee to bring the feelings of the 12 million people of Fujian who love the Volunteer Army back to the Korean front; I must tell all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army about the situation of the people of Fujian working hard to participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, as well as the many touching examples I have heard and witnessed in Fujian.

    在祖国海防前线的福建
    志愿军归国代表  董乐辅
    七月里，我访问了福建省的建阳、福州、厦门、泉州、同安、龙岩等城市和龙岩县的坚持了二十多年革命斗争的英雄村庄后田村。在二十多天中，我看到了英勇的福建人民在建设工作中所获得的巨大成绩。他们已经基本上肃清了土匪，严厉地镇压了反革命活动，有步骤地实行着土地改革，并正以战斗的姿态紧张地克服困难。进行着国防、生产等各项建设。特别是在抗美援朝运动中涌现出来的动人的事例，正和朝鲜前线的朝鲜人民军与我们志愿军在战斗中所表现的一样，是说不尽，写不完的。
    七月五日，我到福州时，福州人民正在热烈地听取赴朝慰问团代表们的报告。听说志愿军归国代表又来了，他们更加兴奋。各地同胞纷纷要求和我见面，要求听我的报告，他们以一种对待亲生儿女和兄弟姊妹一样的心情来接待我。
    在福建各地，我先后和二十六万同胞见了面，还有六万人收听了我的广播。在福州时，福建各民主党派、各机关、部队、学校和其他各界代表三万多人与居民、妇女、农民五万八千多人先后举行了盛大的欢迎会和我见面。许多农民是从市郊二、三十里之外赶来的。在龙岩，后田村的农民打着锣鼓到六、七里之外来欢迎我。我路过的村庄，农民们高兴地燃放着鞭炮。从这里，就可以看到祖国人民对志愿军的十分关心与热爱，也可以看到他们的抗美援朝保家卫国的坚决意志。
    我在福建工作期间，看到了各地同胞热烈开展捐献运动的盛况。福建公路局修理厂的工人，听说志愿军代表要来，即利用工余时间赶修三辆坏车子，把所得工资捐献飞机大炮。福建机器厂车工部工人高飞，在听过报告之后，有病还要坚持工作，班长叫他休息，他回答说：“我们在增产捐献时应当献出一切。比起在朝鲜的志愿军，我们的辛苦还差得远呢。”福州市的教育工作者，原计划在半年中增产捐献九千万元，现在提高到了二亿四千万元。福州市妇女原决定捐献战斗机一架，当我离开福州往厦门时，她们提出：“等董代表从厦门回来时我们完成捐献任务。”七月二十一日，她们就完成了捐献计划，到三十日认捐总额达到了二十二亿元。（捐献的金饰、房地产等还未计算在内）。在捐献运动中出现了许多感人的故事。如福州鼓楼区妇女陈明贞，说服了婆婆捐出三幢房子。少桥区妇女周景春，挑了一大担破铜废铁送到区妇联会，里面有从家里搜罗到的几百枚铜元、两枚银元。她当场并脱下金耳环一对，一齐捐献。
    各地同胞除了热烈捐献飞机大炮之外，还献出了许多心爱的物品来慰问志愿军。福州市民主妇女联合会一位同志献出了福州市长送给她的一个日记本。这是她准备庆祝她爱人第一部著作出版时的礼品。另一位女同志献出她珍藏了八年的一个景德镇小花瓶和一块“北寺塔”镇纸。她在给我的信里写道：“抗日战争中最艰难的时候，我都没丢掉它……我想将来同我最心爱的人生活在一起时摆在桌上。今天我觉得世界上还有什么人比你们更可爱呢？你代表了人民的心，传达了志愿军同志许多生动事迹，你就是我最敬爱的人，我要送给你……”另一位妇女从手指上取下金戒指，要我代她带给志愿军战斗英雄郭忠田。厦门一位华侨妇女把一枚钻石戒指戴到我的手上。厦门的小学生献出了三百多件他们自己的美术作品。福建省抗美援朝分会陈绍宽主席，将四架望远镜送给志愿军。最难得的是龙岩后田村农民，献出了他们最宝贵的革命纪念品，一枝曾在一九二九年起义时用过的铁矛。
    据福建省抗美援朝分会的不完全统计，我在福建时期，各地人民献给志愿军的锦旗有一百九十三面，给志愿军的慰问信有一千四百多封。其他物品更多，仅福州市就有金饰、文具、药品、衣物等三千三百多件。
    我永远记得福州一位女同志给我写的信：“无论如何要请你把我的一颗热爱志愿军的心带到前方去。”
    福建省的同胞们，同志们，我保证把福建全省一千二百万人热爱志愿军的心情带回朝鲜前线去；我一定要把福建人民努力参加抗美援朝运动的情况以及我在福建耳闻目击的许多感人的事例，告诉志愿军全体指战员。
