Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 4)
　　Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi

　　Second Object

　　There is a verb, but the object is missing. Some verbs often do not have an object, such as "Someone is sitting, someone is standing." Some verbs often have an object, but can be omitted in certain situations (currently, referring to the above, or generally), such as "Look!" "I'll write it." But in the following sentences, there is no reason not to arrange an object for the verbs in bold.
　　　　(1) Although I am busy with work every day, I still seize the time to conduct research with classmates or read books myself. (Periodical)
　　　　(2) When starting a workshop meeting, it is necessary to make the workers understand the entire production process and how to do a good job in enterprise publicity and mobilization work, especially when the types of machines in the workshop are complex. (Book)
　　　　(3) Even in terms of subject matter outside of style, we can often find the same or similar expressions of the life, clothing, and ancient Chinese mythology and legends of the time in the Dunhuang murals and Han stone carvings. (Periodical)

　　(1) "Seize" what? "Time" cannot be omitted. (2) "Need" what? "To make the workers understand the entire production process." As seen above, "need" can be changed to "there is an even greater need for this". (With the word "even greater," "especially" can be deleted.) (3) "Find" what? It cannot be "mythology and legends," because this is the object of "expression." "Details"? "Graphics"? In short, there must be a noun ("expressing..." is the adjunct of this noun). "In terms of subject matter outside of style" is also ungrammatical. Can "subject matter" include "style"? (See Section 10 of Lecture 3, "except for..." section.) This sentence should perhaps be said: "Dunhuang murals and Han stone carvings not only have similarities in style, but even have similarities in subject matter. They all express the... of the time." The problem with the following sentence is the same, although not as obvious.

　　　　(4) In addition to striving for consolidation and development on the original basis of general schools, worker-peasant secondary schools have also been widely established to train worker-peasant cadres, and in addition, spare-time schools, adult night schools and children's remedial schools have been opened. (Periodical)

　　What is being "established" is worker-peasant secondary schools, and what is being "opened" are spare-time schools, etc. What is being "consolidated and developed"? "General schools." These four words are present in the sentence, but where are they placed? With the addition of "的," they have become the adjunct of "original basis." This is incorrect. It should be said: "In addition to striving for consolidation and development of general schools on their original basis..."

　　There is an object, but the verb is missing. This seems impossible, but there are actually examples of this. Such as:

　　　　(5) Farmers are always not enthusiastic about the autumn grain collection work, because there is a criminal Li Zhaoan in the township, who, despite being criticized, still does not repent, concealing land and intimidating farmers to falsely accuse township cadres and other illegal acts. (Newspaper)
　　　　(6) Recently, a comprehensive quality inspection campaign has been launched to establish and strengthen a series of work such as technical management systems in this campaign. (Newspaper)

　　(5) "Illegal acts" is the object of which verb? The word "has" should be added before "concealing land," or "and other illegal acts" should be removed. (6) "A series of work" is the object of which verb? Perhaps it is "establish and strengthen"? Then "system" becomes the appositive of "work," which is incomprehensible. A system is a system, not work. The author probably means "to complete a series of work such as establishing and strengthening technical management systems in this campaign."

　　The object and verb do not match properly. Similar to the section on "subject and predicate do not match properly" in the previous lecture, this discusses not the improper use of words, but structural errors. For example:

　　　　(7) Commemorate the arrival of March 8th. (Composition)
　　　　(8) The money earned is not enough to support a family's life. (Composition)
　　　　(9) During the rescue, while fighting the enemy on land, they also had to counter enemy aircraft's strafing and bombing. (Newspaper)

　　(7) Only "March 8th" can be commemorated, not "arrival."
　　(8) Only "people" can be supported, not "life." (9) Only "enemy aircraft" can be countered, not "strafing and bombing." These three sentences can be compared with examples (17) to (20) in the previous section, committing the same type of error.

　　　　(10) But there are also the following shortcomings that need our efforts. (Periodical)

　　The problem with this sentence is exactly the opposite of the above three sentences. What we can strive for is not "shortcomings," but "correcting shortcomings."

　　　　(11) She really had some gentlemanly readers and many young boys and girls from petty-bourgeois families. (Education)

　　"Having readers" is acceptable, but what does "having young boys and girls" mean? To change it, it can only be changed to "She really had many readers—some gentlemen and young boys and girls from petty-bourgeois families."
　　(But it is still a bit problematic to juxtapose "gentlemen" of unknown class origin with "young boys and girls" who are described as coming from petty-bourgeois families.)

　　　　(12) To not sympathize with and not support women who have suffered from the oppression of the feudal marriage system. (Newspaper)

　　This sentence is a complaint. But is it not good to not sympathize with and not support the oppression suffered by women? Originally, the author meant "To not sympathize with and not support women who have suffered feudal marriage oppression." (So the following text says "so that many women who rose up to fight were isolated and failed.")

　　Object Defect. Whether a phrase or sentence form can be used as an object depends on what the preceding verb is; some verbs can only use simple nouns as objects. For example:

　　　　(13) We are willing to do everything in our power to help Chinese agriculture embark on mechanization and collectivization. (Periodical)
　　　　(14) Currently, these areas have proposed to complete the task even if it does not rain, and a drought-resistant sowing campaign has been enthusiastically launched. (Newspaper)
　　　　(15) The Yin Dynasty society had reached the stage of using a large number of slaves for agricultural planting and animal husbandry production. (Periodical)
　　　　(16) The Korean People's Army, shouldering the task of defending the motherland, bravely advances. (Periodical)
　　　　(17) What we should pay more attention to is that among the local bullies, some local bullies may have participated in destroying cultural relics and looting ancient tombs. (Periodical)
　　　　(18) Not believing in hands, only believing in books, naturally also develops detachment from the masses and adherence to dogma. (Newspaper)
　　　　(19) Because the questions raised are unclear, we have to spend a considerable amount of time collecting materials, causing the leadership to be busy answering questions and unable to leave the office. (Newspaper)
　　　　(20) But because in the past, the leadership did not clearly understand the scope of the cultural center's work, there was a phenomenon of grabbing people in a hurry and using cultural center cadres as general administrative cadres or clerical cadres. (Periodical)

　　The verbs in these sentences all require a noun as their object, but there isn't one; there are only phrases or sentence forms attached to the omitted noun. The corrections are (13) embark on...the road, (14) propose...the slogan, (15) reach...the stage, (16) shoulder...the responsibility, (17) participate in...illegal acts, (18) develop...the habit, (19) cause...the phenomenon, (20) the phenomenon of...occurred. (In example 14, "in the absence of rain" should be changed to "although it does not rain." In example 15, the word "着" is useless, neither comma is necessary, and the final part is too repetitive, so it should be simplified to "engage in agricultural production" or "engage in planting and animal husbandry." In example 17, "among the local bullies" should be removed, or the second "local bully" should be removed. The "we" at the beginning and the "的" at the end should also be deleted.)

　　The object involves the following text. Some verbs, such as "make," "let," and "advise," allow or even require their object to also be the subject of the second verb. (See Section 4 of Lecture 1, "complex predicate" section.) But not every verb can have this format, and those that can are relatively few. The verbs in the following sentences cannot have this format, but the author insisted on giving them this format.

　　　　(21) Productive workers are afraid that working on a job together with unskilled helpers will reduce product quality and affect the completion of the task. (Newspaper)
　　　　(22) Moreover, several scholars in the Qing Dynasty had criticized the Kangxi Dictionary for having many errors and shortcomings. (Manuscript)
　　　　(23) This price ratio makes cotton farmers no longer worry about the fall in cotton prices and greatly encourages them to plant cotton freely. (Newspaper)
　　　　(24) Educate them to thoroughly understand and support the government's land reform policy. (Newspaper)
　　　　(25) In order to take care of the workers so that their health is not damaged due to strenuous labor... (Manuscript)
　　　　(26) Organize more than a hundred people who can weave straw hats to start working. (Book)

　　(21) Should be changed to "affect the completion of the task" or "make the task unable to be completed." (22) Should be changed to "criticized it, pointing out many errors and shortcomings." (23) Should change "encourage" to "encourage." (24) Should be changed to "Educate them so that they thoroughly understand..."
　　(25) Should be changed to "In order to take care of the workers' health, so as not to let it be damaged by strenuous labor." (26) Should be changed to "Mobilize more than a hundred people who can weave straw hats, and let them all start working." ("Organize" not only cannot have the format of involving the following text, but also the meaning is incorrect here.)

　　From the above two sections, it can be seen that pairing a verb with a single word (of course, with modifiers) as an object is still the most basic format. If you want to use a format other than a single word as an object, you must first see if the verb allows it. (End of this section, entire article not finished)

    语法、修辞讲话（第四讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第二段宾语
    有动词，缺宾语。有些动词是经常没有宾语的，如“有人坐着，有人站着”。有些动词是经常有宾语的，但在一定的场合（当前，承上，或泛指）可以省略，如“你看！”“我来写”。但是下面这些句子里没有理由不给加点的动词安排一个宾语。
        （一）虽然每天工作很忙，但还是抓紧和同学研
            究或自己看书。（期）
        （二）在开始进行车间会议时，一定要使工友弄
            清整个生产过程，怎样搞好企业宣传鼓动工
            作，特别车间机器种类复杂的更需要。（书）
        （三）甚至于在作风以外的题材内容上，我们也
            可以在敦煌壁画与汉石刻里时常找到相同的
            或类似的表现着当时的生活，服饰，以及中
            国古神话与传说。（期）
    （一）“抓紧”什么？“时间”不能省。（二）“需要”什么？“使工友弄清整个生产过程。”已见上文，可以把“更需要”改做“更有这个需要”。（有了“更”字，“特别”可删。）（三）“找到”什么？不可能是“神话与传说”，因为这是“表现”的宾语。“细节”？“图形”？总之，非有一个名词不可（“表现着……”是这个名词的附加语）。“在作风以外的题材内容上”也不通，难道“题材内容”能包括“作风”在内吗？（参阅第三讲第十段“除…外”节。）这句话也许应该这样说：“敦煌壁画和汉石刻，不但作风有相似之处，甚至题材也有相同之点，它们同样表现着当时的……。”底下这一句的毛病相同，虽然没有这样明显。
    （四）除在一般学校的原有基础上力求巩固和发
            展外，并普遍建立了工农速成中学以培养工
            农干部，此外还开办了业余学校、成人夜校
            和儿童补习学校。（期）“建立”的是工农速成中学，“开办”的是业余学校等等，“巩固和发展”的是什么呢？“一般学校。”这四个字，这个句子里是有的，可是放在什么位置上呢？加了个“的”字，做了“原有基础”的附加语了。这就不对了。应该说：“除一般学校在原有的基础上力求巩固和发展外……。”
    有宾语，缺动词。这似乎是不可能的事情，但事实上有这种例子。如：
    （五）农民对秋征工作老是不起劲，因为该乡有
            犯罪分子李兆安，虽经展开批评，仍不悔
            悟，隐瞒田亩并恐吓农民诬告乡干等非法行
            为。（报）
    （六）最近又发动了全面的质量大检查运动，要
            在这个运动中建立与加强技术管理制度等一
            系列的工作。（报）
    （五）“非法行为”是哪个动词的宾语呢？应该在“隐瞒田亩”前面加个“有”字，或是把“等非法行为”去掉。（六）“一系列的工作”是哪个动词的宾语呢？也许是“建立与加强”？那么，“制度”成了“工作”的同位语，这是讲不通的，制度是制度，不是工作。作者的意思大约是“要在这个运动中完成建立与加强技术管理制度等一系列的工作”。
    宾语和动词配合不当。跟上一段讲“主语和谓语配合不当”的一节相同，这里讨论的不是用词不当，而是结构错误。例如：
        （七）纪念三八节的到来。（作）
        （八）赚来的钱还不够养活一家人的生活（作）。
        （九）在抢修中，一面对着陆地上的敌人进行战
            斗，一面还要反击敌机的扫射轰炸。（报）
    （七）纪念的只能是“三八节”，不能是“到来”。
    （八）养活的只能是“人”，不能是“生活”。（九）反击的只能是“敌机”，不能是“扫射轰炸”。这三句可以和上一段（十七）到（二十）例比较，犯的是同类毛病。
        （十）但也存在着以下几个缺点需要我们努力。
                （期）这一句的毛病跟上面三句恰好相反，我们所能努力的不是“缺点”，而是“改正缺点”。
    （十一）她实在拥有过一些绅士式的读者和不少
            小资产阶级出身的少男少女。（教）“拥有读者”是可以的，“拥有少男少女”是什么意思呢？要改只能改做“她实在拥有过不少读者——一些绅士和小资产阶级出身的少男少女”。
    （但是拿不知什么阶级出身的“绅士”和说明是小资产阶级出身的“少男少女”并举，也还是有点问题。）
    （十二）对妇女遭受封建婚姻制度的迫害，不加
            以同情，不给以支持。（报）这句话是不满之辞。但是对于妇女遭受迫害这件事情不加以同情，不给以支持，不是很好吗？原来作者的意思是“对于遭受封建婚姻迫害的妇女，不加以同情，不给以支持”。（所以下文才有“以至不少起来斗争的妇女因孤立无援而失败”的话。）
    宾语残缺。能否用短语或句子形式做宾语，要看前面是什么动词；有些动词是只能用单纯的名词做宾语的。例如：
    （十三）我们愿尽一切的力量帮助中国农业走上
            机械化，集体化。（期）
    （十四）目前这些地区已提出在不下雨的情况下
            也要完成任务，热烈展开了抗旱播种运动。
                （报）
    （十五）殷代的社会，已到达使用着大批奴隶，
            从事农业种植和畜牧的生产工作。（期）
    （十六）肩负保卫祖国的朝鲜人民军勇敢前进。
                （期）
    （十七）还有我们更要注意的，就是在恶霸中，
            可能有些恶霸参加过破坏文化遗址，盗掘古
        墓葬的。（期）（十八）不相信手，只相信书，自然也就养成脱
    离群众和拘于教条。（报）（十九）因为提的问题不明确，我们要化相当时
    间来搜集材料，造成领导机关忙于解答问
        题，走不出办公室。（报）（二十）可是因为过去领导上对文化馆的业务工
    作范围不明确了解，发生了用时乱抓，拿文
    化馆干部当一般的行政干部或事务干部使
        用。（期）这些句子里的动词都要求有一个名词做它的宾语，但是没有，有的只是附加在这个被省略的名词上的短语或句子形式。改正过来是（十三）走上……的道路，（十四）提出……的口号，（十五）到达……的阶段，（十六）肩负……的责任，（十七）参加过……的不法行为，（十八）养成……的习惯，（十九）造成……的现象，（二十）发生了……的现象。（十四例的“在不下雨的情况下”应改做“虽不下雨”。十五例“着”字无用，两个逗号都不该有，末一部分重复太多，应简化为“从事农业生产”，或“从事种植和畜牧”。十七例应去掉“在恶霸中”或去掉第二个“恶霸”，头上的“我们”和末了的“的”也应该删去。）
    宾语牵连下文。有些动词，如“使”“让”“劝”等，容许甚至要求它的宾语兼做第二个动词的主语。（参阅第一讲第四段“复杂的谓语”节。）但决不是每个动词都能有这个格式，能有这个格式的比较还是少数。下面的句子里的动词都是不能有这个格式的，但是作者硬给它安上了这个格式。
   （二一）生产积极的工人害怕和不熟练的帮工共同作一件活会降低产品质量，影响任务不能完成。（报）
   （二二）况且康熙字典在清代已有几位学者批评它错误和缺点很多。（稿）
   （二三）这种比价使棉农再也不愁棉价的跌落，大大地鼓舞了他们放手植棉。（报）
   （二四）教育他们澈底了解及拥护政府的土地改革政策。（报）
   （二五）为照顾工友们不因紧张的劳动而损坏身体健康………。（稿）
   （二六）组织百多个会编席帽子的都动起手来。        （书）
   （二一）该改做“影响任务的完成”或“使任务不能完成”。（二二）该改做“批评过，指出很多错误和缺点”。（二三）该把“鼓舞”改作“鼓励”。（二四）该改做“教育他们，使他们澈底了解……”。
    （二五）该改做“为了照顾工友们的健康，不让它因紧张的劳动而受损害”。（二六）该改做“发动一百多个会编席帽子的，让他们都动起手来”。（“组织”不但不能有牵连下文的格式，并且用在这里意思也不对。）
    从以上两节可以看出，在一个动词后面配上一个单词（当然能有附加语）做宾语，还是最基本的格式。如果要用单词以外的格式做宾语，必须先看看那个动词是否容许。（本段完，全文未完）
