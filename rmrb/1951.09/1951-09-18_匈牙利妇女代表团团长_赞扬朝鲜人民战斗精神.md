Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 13th: Ms. Bugár, head of the Hungarian women's delegation that came here to慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude to) the heroic and resistant Korean people, recently told reporters her impressions of her visit to Korea: "After we arrived in Korea, the first thing we strongly felt was the heroism and indomitable fighting spirit of the Korean people."

"In the cities and villages we visited, almost all the houses have been destroyed into ruins by the American beasts; but the Korean people are still working vigorously. In the vast fields, abundant grains are growing. In particular, the women who have lost their husbands and children in the war, fighting day and night to consolidate the rear and support the front, deeply moved us and further made us realize that the armed aggression of the American imperialist beasts can not only not conquer the Korean people, but is also promoting the Korean people's fighting will and strength to be even stronger."

"We visited several factories. Although these factories have been so badly damaged by American imperialism that their original appearance cannot be seen, we can imagine the great construction carried out by the Korean people in the five years since liberation. Although the factories were destroyed by the fierce and brutal enemy, the heroic Korean workers continue to engage in production with creative labor."

"During our visit to Korea, we concretely saw the brutal and vicious aggressive acts of American imperialism, saw the heroic and tenacious anti-aggression struggle of the Korean people, and heard countless touching heroic deeds of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. After we return to our country, we must report all this to our Hungarian people. We sincerely wish the Korean people an early final victory; at the same time, we guarantee to dedicate all our strength, and work with peace-loving people all over the world to promote the final victory of the Korean people."

    匈牙利妇女代表团团长
    赞扬朝鲜人民战斗精神
    【新华社平壤十三日电】来此慰问英勇抗战的朝鲜人民的匈牙利妇女代表团团长布加尔女士，顷对记者发表访朝印象称：“我们来到朝鲜后，首先就强烈地感到朝鲜人民的英雄主义和不屈不挠的斗争精神。”
    “我们所到过的城市和乡村，所有的房屋几乎都已被美国野兽破坏成为一片废墟；而朝鲜人民仍然有力地劳动着。广大的田野里生长着丰满的五谷。特别是那些在战争中失掉自己的丈夫和儿女的妇女，夜以继日地为巩固后方和支援前线而积极斗争的情形，使我们深深地感动，并进一步认识到美帝国主义野兽的武装侵略不仅不能征服朝鲜人民，而且正促使朝鲜人民的战斗意志和力量更为加强。”
    “我们参观了几所工厂。这些工厂虽然被美帝国主义破坏得看不出原来的面貌。但是就在废墟上，我们可以想到朝鲜人民在解放后五年来所进行的伟大建设的情景。工厂虽被凶恶残暴的敌人破坏，英雄的朝鲜工人仍以创造性的劳动，继续从事生产。”
    “我们此次访问朝鲜，具体地看到了美帝国主义侵略行为的残暴狠毒，看到了朝鲜人民反侵略斗争的英勇顽强，听到了朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹。我们回国后，一定要把这一切报告我们匈牙利人民。我们谨祝朝鲜人民早日取得最后胜利；同时，我们保证献出我们所有的力量，和全世界爱好和平人民一起促进朝鲜人民最后胜利的到来。”
