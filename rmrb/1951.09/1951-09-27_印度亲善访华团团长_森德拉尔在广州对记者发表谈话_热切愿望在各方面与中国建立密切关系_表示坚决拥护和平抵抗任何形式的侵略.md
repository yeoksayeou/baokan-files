Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 26th: Mr. Sundarlal, the leader of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China, made the following statement when he met with reporters in Guangzhou: "As the People's Republic of China celebrates its second anniversary, we bring the congratulations of the Indian people to our great neighbor, the Chinese people. The members of our delegation come from all parts of India and have different professions. We have come to your great country because we love it and respect it. For more than two thousand years, the relations between India and China have been extremely harmonious and close. A large part of ancient Indian history is based on the travelogues written by your great travelers Xuanzang and Faxian. One of our leading professors, Dr. Bagchi, wrote a book about India and China after years of careful study in your country. Unfortunately, due to poor health, he could not come with us. For centuries, China has supplied us and the world with the finest porcelain and silk. For a long time, the works of Chinese artists and craftsmen have been admired all over the world. In the art of painting, China is unparalleled in the world, but perhaps China's greatest contribution to the entire East is the technology of papermaking, which we learned from you in the tenth century.

In the twelfth century, Indians had almost completely lost the habit of traveling abroad. The land route through Xinjiang was closed by the medieval Turkish Empire. The materials excavated by Sir Aurel Stein in the Taklamakan Desert, especially the photographs contained in the fourth volume of his immortal masterpiece "India – Serindia," remind us of how close the cultural relations between our two countries were in past eras.

The eager desire of our delegation, as well as all the Indian people, is that these relations should be restored not only in social and cultural aspects as in ancient times, but also in the political and economic aspects of modern world institutions. I believe that the difference in language is a major obstacle, and we must overcome this obstacle. It will not be long before all our universities open Chinese language departments. Shantiniketan University, founded by the late Dr. Tagore, has already opened such a department.

As for the issue of peace and the crisis of a third world war, the Indian masses, who have accepted the teachings of our great leader Gandhi, firmly support peace, and maintaining international peace is the policy declared to the world by the Indian government and the People's Republic of China. However, advocating peace must never be interpreted as any reduction in the willingness of our two nations to resist any form of aggression.

The People's Republic of China has already announced, through its great General Commander Zhu De, its determination to reunify China's former territories. The Indian people deeply understand your great cause. To maintain world peace, the people of the world must unite on the basis of goodwill, not use war to resolve international disputes, eliminate feudalism, colonialism, and imperialism (whether capitalist or territorialist), and allow people to have the right to establish the government they want without any restrictions. I know that in India, as in other countries, there are some people, like a few deposed princes and some capitalists, who still want to collude with American and British capitalists who believe that a world war will benefit them to exploit the masses, but they have absolutely no place in the hearts of the Indian people, and their influence should not be overestimated. You can very well regard India as a country that has become closely associated with the cause of peace. The Indian people believe, as our Prime Minister Nehru said: 'War solves no problems.'"

When asked about his attitude towards the democratic system of the Chinese people, Mr. Sundarlal replied, "My attitude and the attitude of the entire Indian people are determined by two simple principles. First: the Chinese people are not only the sole but also the best decision-makers regarding the form of government they should have, and no one else has the right to interfere in this matter. You have affirmed your belief in the New Democracy program taught by your great leader Chairman Mao Zedong through a revolution that is one of the greatest revolutions in world history. The Indian people extend a welcome to the People's Republic of China, a world power, for its efforts for peace and progress.

Second: The harmonious relationship between our two peoples should not be affected by the evil winds of party politics or related interference. India has done its best to persuade all major powers to recognize the new People's Republic of China. India has also repeatedly protested against the continued recognition of the Taiwan regime, which is impersonating the entire Chinese government. Professor Oppenheim, a great British jurist, said that recognizing a new country is not a matter of choice and cannot be used as a bargaining chip or extortion. Recognition in international law and international custom: 'Declaring (a government) capable of ruling' is the recognition of a government's sole and effective exercise of rule over a certain territory. All authoritative jurists in the East and the West hold this same view. India will continue to strive to have the People's Republic of China recognized as one of the strongest countries in the world. We have come here to pay tribute to your government for the outstanding achievements and lofty ideals of your new government. In the past two days, we have had the opportunity to understand some aspects of the program of your democratic republic, and we hope that this program will be a complete success."

When asked about the Indian people's knowledge of China, Mr. Sundarlal said, "Although there are constant reports about China in our newspapers, there is still a lack of practical feeling about this information. However, the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing has done an excellent job. Chairman Mao's works have been printed in several editions in India, and the Indian people's demand for works reporting on new China is increasing, and this demand should be met.

The names of the great leaders of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, General Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, are household names in India. The Indian people are increasingly wanting to know more about the Chinese people and their leaders. Now, many people who want to buy magazines as good as 'People's China' cannot buy them. The work of the 'Foreign Languages Press' in Beijing should be expanded."

When asked if the members of the Indian delegation felt comfortable during this trip, Mr. Sundarlal smiled and replied, "When your great traveler Xuanzang visited the court of the Indian Emperor Harsha, Harsha gave him gifts that only the emperor could bestow. About thirteen hundred years later, you are receiving the Indian delegation with the deep affection and care that only a people's democratic government (a government that not only guides the people's actions but also wins their hearts) can give us."

    印度亲善访华团团长
    森德拉尔在广州对记者发表谈话
    热切愿望在各方面与中国建立密切关系
    表示坚决拥护和平抵抗任何形式的侵略
    【新华社广州二十六日电】印度亲善访华团团长森德拉尔在广州接见记者时曾发表谈话如下：“当此中华人民共和国庆祝成立两周年之际，我们带来了印度人民向我们伟大的邻居——中国人民——致贺之意。我们代表团的团员们来自印度各地，各有不同的职业。我们来到你们这个伟大的国家，是因为我们爱这个国家，并且尊敬这个国家。两千多年来，印中两国之间的关系极为融洽和密切。印度古代史中，有一大部分是根据你们伟大的游历家玄奘和法显等所写下的游记写出来的。我国的权威教授之一勃契博士，在贵国内地经过多年精心钻研之后曾著了一本关于印度与中国的书。很遗憾的，为了健康不好，他不能和我们一起来。中国几百年来供给我们和世界以最精美的瓷器和丝绸。好久以来，中国艺术家和工匠们的作品一直受到全世界的赞美。在绘画艺术上，中国是世界无匹的，但是，中国对于整个东方的最大的贡献，恐怕是造纸技术，我们在第十世纪向你们学到这种技术。
    在十二世纪时，印度人几乎已经完全没有到国外去游历的风尚。取道新疆的陆路是被中世纪土耳其帝国封闭了。奥雷斯脱因爵士在塔克拉买干沙漠所发掘出来的材料，特别是他的不朽巨著“印度——爵士”第四卷中所载的照片，使我们想起贵我两国在以往年代中的文化关系是多么密切。
    我们代表团，以及全体印度人民的热切愿望就是：这些关系不仅要像古时那样的在社会与文化方面恢复过来，而且也要在现代世界机构政治和经济方面恢复过来，我相信语言不同是一大障碍，我们必须克服这个障碍，我们所有的大学都开设中国语文系，为时已不远。已故博士泰戈尔创办的山汀聂凯坦大学，现在已经开设了这种学系。
    至于对和平与第三次世界大战危机问题，接受了我们伟大领袖甘地的教义的印度大众坚决拥护和平，而且维持国际和平是印度政府，同时也是中华人民共和国向世界昭示的政策。但是，主张和平绝不能被解释为我们两个民族对抵抗任何形式的侵略的意愿将有任何削减。
    中华人民共和国已经由其伟大将领朱德总司令宣布过中国重新统一以前领土的决心。印度人民是深切了解你们这个伟大的事业的。要维持世界和平，全世界人民就要在善意的基础上组织起来，不要用战争来解决国际间的纷争，消灭封建主义、殖民地主义和帝国主义（不论是资本主义的或领土主义的）以及让人民有建立自己愿意建立的政府的权利而不受任何限制。我知道：在印度，正如在其他国家中一样，有一些像少数被废了的王子和一些资本家那样的人，他们仍旧想要伙同以为世界大战将对他们有利的美英资本家们来剥削人民大众，但是，他们在印度人民的心目中绝对没有地位，他们的影响也不应予以过分的估计。你们大可以把印度视作一个已与和平事业紧密相结合的国家。印度人民相信：如我们的总理尼赫鲁先生所说：‘战争解决不了任何问题。’”
    在被问及对中国人民民主制度采取何种态度时，森德拉尔答称：“我的态度和全印人民的态度是决定于两个简单的原则。第一是：中国人民对于他们所应有的政府形式，不仅是唯一的，而且也是最好的取决者，除了他们之外，任何人都没有权利干涉这事。你们已经以世界历史中最大革命之一的革命肯定了你们对于你们伟大领袖毛泽东主席所教导的新民主主义纲领的信仰。印度人民伸手欢迎中华人民共和国这一个世界强国为和平与进步而努力。
    第二：我们两国人民之间的融洽的关系，不应为政党政治的邪风或有关的干涉所影响。印度已尽其所能劝说一切强国承认新的中华人民共和国。印度也曾一再抗议继续承认假冒全中国政府的台湾政权。英国的大法学家奥本汉教授说：承认一个新的国家，不是一件可以选择的事，不能被用来作为讨价还价或敲诈之用。在国际法和国际习惯上承认：‘宣布（某一政府）有统治能力’是对于某一政府在某一领土上唯一而有效的实行统治的认可。一切东方与西方的权威法学家们都抱着这个相同的见解。印度将继续努力使中华人民共和国被承认为世界最强国之一，我们来到这里是为了你们的新政府有很杰出的成就和远大理想而向你们政府表示敬意。在过去两天，我们有机会了解你们民主共和国的纲领的若干方面，我们希望这个纲领美满成功。”
    当被问及印度人民对于中国的知识时，森德拉尔先生说：“虽然在我们的报纸上不断有关于中国的报道，但对这些消息还缺乏实际感觉。但北京的外国语文出版社，却做了出色的工作。毛主席的著作在印度已经印行过好几版，印度人民对于报道新中国事物的著作的要求，愈来愈多，这个要求，是应该加以满足的。
    中华人民共和国的伟大领袖们的名字毛泽东主席、朱德将军、周恩来总理、刘少奇副主席等在印度是家喻户晓的。关于中国人民和领袖，印度人民越来越想多知道。现在许多想要买‘人民中国’那样好的杂志的人，也买不到它了。北京的‘外国语文出版社’的工作，应该加以扩大。”
    谈及印度代表团团员们在这一次旅行中是否觉得舒适时，森德拉尔先生微笑地答道：“当你们伟大的旅行家玄奘访问印度皇帝夏沙的宫庭时，夏沙曾把只有皇帝才能授予的礼物授予他。约在一千三百年以后，你们则正以只有人民民主政府（这个政府不仅指引人民行动，而且获得了民心）才能给予我们的隆情厚谊和关怀来接待印度代表团。”
