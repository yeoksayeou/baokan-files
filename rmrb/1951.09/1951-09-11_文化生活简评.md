Brief Comments on Cultural Life

	"Literary Gazette," Volume 4, Issue 10, Continues to Criticize Incorrect Literary Thoughts

The gradual unfolding of literary criticism is a gratifying phenomenon in the current literary and ideological circles. However, some people still have some incorrect views on literary criticism and have expressed some erroneous opinions. The most prominent examples are two articles: "A Brief Discussion on Our Literary Criticism" (Wenhui Daily, "Literary Circle," No. 70, author Luo Shi) and "On Correct Criticism Attitude" (Guangming Daily, "Literary Review," No. 37, author Qiu Zuying). The recently published "Literary Gazette," Volume 4, Issue 10, published Qi Xia's short essay "On Literary Criticism," criticizing these incorrect views, pointing out that the former attempts to obliterate the achievements of literary criticism, separates the political nature of works from their artistic nature, and castrates the political content of literary criticism. The latter seizes on the shortcomings in attitude in individual critical articles and exaggerates them inappropriately, covering up the essence of the current principled literary criticism. Such theories and evaluations are harmful to the development of literary criticism.

How to use literary forms to educate farmers with advanced ideas is a question worthy of attention. This issue of "Literary Gazette" publishes three articles on this issue: "A Problem Worth Noting" (author Xie Yun) and "Seen From a Newsletter" (author Wen Bo), pointing out that some works currently portraying farmers vulgarly depict mass movements with serious political significance, such as the patriotic cotton planting movement, as merely satisfying the narrow current interests of farmers in terms of economics, and indiscriminately praise the individual economy and the capitalist ideas growing among farmers, instead of using the advanced ideas of the working class to educate farmers, in order to strengthen and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

This issue of "Literary Gazette" also reprinted Xia Yan's "From the Criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun' to Reviewing My Work in the Shanghai Cultural and Art Circles," published in this newspaper on August 26. In this article, Xia Yan reviewed some of the problems existing in the leadership of Shanghai's literary and artistic work, pointing out that the fundamental problem lies in the failure to adhere to Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought line, and the inability to specifically apply this correct line in Shanghai to formulate a clear work direction serving the urban people, first and foremost the working class.

Northeast China's Harbin and other places have carried out the work of training theoretical instructors

The Propaganda Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee, and the Propaganda Department of the Songjiang Provincial Committee have all carried out the work of training theoretical instructors. The Propaganda Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee even regards the training of theoretical instructors as one of the key points of this year's on-the-job cadre education work. In order to continue to train theoretical instructors, unify teaching viewpoints, improve teaching quality, and strengthen the leadership of part-time instructors, relevant instructors are convened in advance for a symposium before each lecture to study the lecture center. This provides instructors and guides with convenient conditions for learning and preparing lectures. The Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee held a teacher training class in early April where they taught while learning, providing the primary conditions for the establishment and maintenance of more than 60 amateur political schools in the city this year. The Propaganda Department of the Songjiang Provincial Committee convened comrades in charge of cadre education work from Shuangcheng and other six counties in mid-June to discuss the issue of training theoretical instructors. The meeting unanimously agreed that in order to carry out cadre learning in the future, it is necessary to train a certain number of instructors and establish a system of full-time instructors. It was also believed that the method of advocating learning what one teaches first can be promoted to solve the difficulty of inconsistent teaching among some instructors, and to enable instructors to develop in the direction of specializing in teaching a certain course well.

The Northeast Branch of the People's Bank of China Established a Study Room and Gained Experience

The Northeast Branch of the People's Bank of China established a study room in March of this year. In the past few months, the study room has played a great role in theoretical education work.

The task of the study room is: to specifically help cadres carry out theoretical study, making it an institution that systematically organizes and guides theoretical education.

In order to strive for greater achievements, the study room is also preparing to try out "seminars" in political theory classes based on past joint discussion meetings, and to train a group of activists with higher theoretical levels to become "seminar" instructors; in self-study groups, in addition to strengthening the leadership of each group leader, thematic discussions will also be organized within a certain period. Organize various discussion meetings, report meetings, research meetings, exhibitions, etc. in a planned way to widely attract comrades to participate, in order to create a strong learning atmosphere. Hire consultants to be responsible for guiding learning, answering difficult questions, and making special reports.

The study room is a good institution for guiding cadres' theoretical study and assisting study consultants and theoretical instructors. The experience of the study room of the Northeast Branch of the People's Bank of China is worthy of attention in various places.

    文化生活简评
    四卷十期“文艺报”继续对不正确的文艺思想展开批评
    文艺批评的日渐展开，是目前文艺界、思想界可喜的现象。但是，有些人对于文艺批评却还有着一些不正确的看法，并发表了一些错误的意见。其中最突出的例子是“略论我们的文艺批评”（文汇报“文学界”第七十期，作者罗石）和“论正确的批评态度”（光明日报“文学评论”第三十七期，作者裘祖英）二文。最近出版的四卷十期“文艺报”发表了企霞的短论“关于文艺批评”，对这些不正确的看法进行批评，指出前者企图抹煞文艺批评的成果，将作品的政治性与艺术性分裂开来，以阉割文艺批评的政治内容。后者抓住个别批评文章中态度上的缺点，加以不适当的夸大，掩盖了目前展开的原则性的文艺批评的实质，这样的理论与评价对于文艺批评的展开是有害的。
    如何运用文艺形式，以先进思想教育农民，这是一个值得重视的问题。本期“文艺报”登载了有关这一问题的三篇文章：“一个值得注意的问题”
    （作者谢云）和“从一篇通讯看到的”（作者闻博），指出目前某些表现农民的作品，把具有严肃的政治意义的群众运动，如爱国植棉运动等，庸俗地描写成仅仅为了满足农民经济上的狭隘的目前利益，在作品中无原则地歌颂个体经济，歌颂农民中生长的资本主义思想，而不是用工人阶级的先进思想，去教育农民，以加强和巩固工农联盟。
    本期“文艺报”还转载了八月二十六日本报所刊夏衍的“从‘武训传’的批判检讨我在上海文化艺术界的工作”一文。在这篇文章中夏衍检讨了上海文艺领导工作中存在的一些问题，指出基本的问题在于不能坚持毛主席的文艺思想路线，不能把这个正确的路线在上海具体应用，制定出为城市人民大众，首先为工人群众服务的明确的工作方向。
    东北哈尔滨等地进行了培养理论教员的工作
    中共哈尔滨市委宣传部、沈阳市委宣传部、松江省委宣传部，都进行了培养理论教员的工作。哈尔滨市委宣传部更把培养理论教员，作为今年在职干部教育工作的重点之一。为了继续培养理论教员，统一教学观点，提高教学质量，加强对兼职教员的领导，在每讲开始前预先召集有关教员举行座谈会，研究讲课中心。这样就给教员指导员以学习、准备讲课的便利条件。沈阳市委宣传部曾于四月初举办了边教边学的教员训练班，为今年该市六十余处业余政治学校的创办与坚持，提供了首要的条件。松江省委宣传部曾于六月中旬召集了双城等六县负责干部教育工作的同志，座谈培养理论教员工作问题。会议一致认为，要开展今后干部学习，必须培养出一定数量的教员，建立专职教员的制度。并认为可以提倡教什么就首先学好什么的办法，以解决某些教员的教学不统一的困难，并使教员得以向专门教好一门课程的方向发展。
    中国人民银行东北区行设立学习室并获得经验
    中国人民银行东北区行，在今年三月间设立了学习室。几个月来，学习室曾在理论教育工作上，起了很大的作用。
    该学习室的任务是：具体地帮助干部进行理论学习，使它成为系统地组织指导理论教育的机构。
    为了争取更大的成绩，该学习室还准备在政治理论班内，以过去的联组讨论会为基础，试行“习明纳尔”，并培养一批理论水平较高的积极分子成为“习明纳尔”教员；在自修组内，除加强对各小组长的领导外，并在一定时期内组织专题讨论。有计划地组织各种讨论会、报告会、研究会、展览会等，广泛吸引同志们参加，以造成浓厚的学习空气。聘请顾问，负责指导学习、解答疑难问题、做专题报告等工作。
    学习室是指导干部理论学习、帮助学习顾问和理论教员工作的很好机构。中国人民银行东北区行学习室的经验，是值得各地重视的。
