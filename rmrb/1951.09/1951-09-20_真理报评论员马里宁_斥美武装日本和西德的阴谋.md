Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 18th: *Pravda* observer Marinin wrote an article commenting on the decisions of the US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting in Washington and the US-Japan military treaty signed in San Francisco. He wrote: Not only is the general outline and trend of the US imperialist aggression plan very clear, but also the main springboards it intends to use to launch another world massacre are very clear. The role of springboard is assigned to Japan in the Far East, and to West Germany in Europe. After embarking on the road of aggression and international adventure, the US ruling clique decided to revamp, under their leadership, the "alliance of forces" that once constituted the basis of the fascist "axis" world's aggressive strategy.

The US ruling clique signed the US-Japan military treaty in San Francisco for one purpose: to turn Japan into their main springboard and attack force for launching aggression again in the Far East. The decisions made at the recent Washington meeting of the US, British, and French foreign ministers show that US imperialism is determined to turn West Germany into its main base and attack force for aggression in Europe.

The documents already published show that West Germany will not only be formally dragged into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, but will also become the most important base of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. It is precisely for this purpose that the Washington Conference, in addition to the previously adopted Schuman Plan, also adopted a Pleven Plan.

The French ruling clique, under the direction of its US masters, proposed the Pleven Plan, which is the most despicable betrayal of the vital interests of the French nation. They are reviving German imperialism with their own hands and intend to establish a military alliance with German imperialism. Obviously, this policy breeds war in Europe and is in irreconcilable conflict with the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which is one of the pillars of European peace.

The days when the US "Schuman Plan" was fiercely criticized on the banks of the Thames are over. Washington's directives have had a definite impact on the Labor government. Morrison assured those attending the Washington Conference that the British government hoped to establish the closest possible ties with the European continental bloc at every stage of its development. In order to "contribute" to the war preparations in Europe, the Labor government is assisting in the establishment of the US-Ruhr super-cartel, whose task is to completely destroy Britain's economic position in continental Europe and make Britain's economy completely subordinate to the United States. Morrison and Schuman are truly competing to sell out the national interests of their countries.

The San Francisco conference, which recently concluded a separate peace treaty with Japan, was another step in preparing for war in the Far East, while the Washington meeting of the three foreign ministers was another step in preparing for war in Europe.

Marinin pointed out that the Japanese people have launched large-scale demonstrations and protests in response to the deeds of US imperialism in San Francisco. The Japan General Peace Patriotic Movement Council, representing 15 million people, the Japan Democratic Women's Council, and many youth groups have lodged strong protests against these deeds.

The decisions of the Washington meeting of the three foreign ministers aroused the anger of the broad masses in Germany. The proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to convene an all-German conference of representatives from East and West Germany has won great support from the entire German people. All peace-loving people support this proposal and believe that it is a solid foundation for eliminating the division of Germany and preparing conditions for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified Germany.

    斥美武装日本和西德的阴谋
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”观察家马里宁著文评论美英法三国外长华盛顿会议的决定及在旧金山签订的美日军事条约。他写道：不仅是美帝国主义的侵略计划的总轮廓及趋势很清楚了，就是它打算借以发动另一次世界屠杀的主要跳板也很清楚了。跳板角色在远东是分配给日本，在欧洲是分配给西德。美国统治集团在走上侵略及国际冒险的道路以后，就决定在他们的领导下把曾经构成法西斯“轴心”世界侵略战略基础的“力量的联合”重新加以翻版。
    美国统治集团在旧金山签订美日军事条约是为了一个目的，即把日本变为他们的再度在远东发动侵略的主要跳板与攻击力量。最近美英法三国外长华盛顿会议所作的决定显示，美帝国主义决定把西德变为它在欧洲侵略的主要基地与攻击力量。
    已经发表的文件显示，西德不仅将被正式拖进北大西洋侵略集团内，同时也将成为北大西洋侵略集团最重要的基地。正是为了这一个目的，华盛顿会议才在以前通过的舒曼计划外，又通过了一个普利文计划。
    法国统治集团在美国主子指使下提出普利文计划，是最卑鄙地出卖了法国民族切身利益，他们正以自己的手来复活德国帝国主义，并且打算与德国帝国主义成立军事同盟。很明显地，这种政策孕育着欧洲的战争，并与法苏同盟互助条约有不能并存的矛盾，而法苏同盟互助条约乃是欧洲和平的支柱之一。
    美国的“舒曼计划”在泰晤士河畔受到猛烈抨击的时日已经过去了。华盛顿的指令对工党政府已发生了确定的影响。莫里逊向参加华盛顿会议的人们保证：英国政府希望在欧洲大陆集团的每一个发展阶段中都和它建立最密切的联系。为了要对欧洲的备战有所“贡献”，工党政府正在助成美国——鲁尔超级卡特尔的建立，而这个卡特尔的任务却是要把英国在欧洲大陆的经济地位彻底加以破坏，并使英国的经济完全从属于美国。莫里逊与舒曼真是竞相出卖他们祖国的民族利益。
    最近单独缔结对日和约的旧金山会议是准备远东战争的又一步骤，而华盛顿三外长会议则是准备欧洲战争的又一步骤。
    马里宁指出：日本人民已经发动了大规模的示威与抗议来回答美帝国主义在旧金山所干的勾当。代表一千五百万人民的日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会、日本民主妇女协议会与许多青年团体已经对这种勾当提出了坚决的抗议。
    华盛顿三外长会议的决定激起了德国广大群众的愤怒。德意志民主共和国人民议会要求召开东西德双方代表的全德会议的建议，赢得全德国人民极大的支持。一切爱好和平的人民都拥护这个建议，并且认为这是消除德国分裂状态、为尽早与统一的德国缔结和约准备条件的坚实基础。
