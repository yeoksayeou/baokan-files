To the Respected Chairman Mao:

The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Railway Workers' Union are holding the National Railway Labor Model Representative Conference this time. We, the five hundred representatives, have come to the capital to participate in this grand meeting and have been warmly welcomed and received. We feel greatly honored.

Before we came to Beijing, the comrades repeatedly told us to convey their respect and remembrance to you. We would like to take this opportunity to extend our greetings to your health and pay you the highest respect!

We know that without your and the Communist Party's wise leadership, how could we have today's glory and happiness? Thinking back to the past, under the dark and brutal rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the suffering we workers endured is truly indescribable. Being scolded and bullied was commonplace; working hard to the point of exhaustion was ignored; layers of deductions and exploitation left us unable to eat our fill and wear warm clothes. When we got sick, we could only wait for death. At the slightest provocation, we were kicked and punched. They simply didn't treat us like human beings.

Under your and the Communist Party's leadership, the three great mountains that had been weighing down on our heads for years have been overthrown. Especially since the day China had railways, the forces of American, British, and Japanese devils who directly ruled us have been driven away, which makes us feel that the Chinese people have truly stood up.

Looking at the present, under your and the Communist Party's leadership, we workers have completely changed. We, who had no status in the old society, can now sit down with section chiefs and factory directors to discuss production and work, and good suggestions are adopted. In the movements to suppress counter-revolutionaries and democratic reforms, bad people have been suppressed, and good people have been given a voice. The Trade Union Law and Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the People's Government provide legal guarantees for our work and life. Under the current circumstances where the just war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has not yet ended and the country's financial situation is still very difficult, the leadership is still doing everything possible to appropriately address our welfare issues. All these facts make us deeply realize that we have truly turned over and become masters, the leading class of the country.

Chairman Mao, it is you and the Party who have educated us. Now everyone understands that working is for the motherland, for the people, and also for ourselves. The phenomenon of "loafing on the job" and "spending time in the latrine" that existed before liberation is long gone. Now everyone is working harder and harder. In the past, materials were wasted at will, and no one cared when machines broke down. Now everyone values machines and all state property more than their own lives. Not only that, but everyone is also using their brains to improve tools and working methods, and there have been many inventions and creations.

Since liberation, under your and the Party's leadership, we have made some achievements in production and work, but we are not satisfied with this. There are still many shortcomings in our work that need to be continuously improved.

At present, the U.S. imperialists still harbor不死 [untamed] ambitions. On the one hand, they are sabotaging the Kaesong talks, and on the other hand, they are unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan, plotting to invade our motherland and other Asian countries. In order to defend our fruits of victory and defeat the U.S. imperialist aggression plan, we will certainly follow your instructions and, together with the people of the whole country, fight to accelerate the construction of a strong national defense and economic power.

We, all railway workers, commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps, the Railway Public Security Column, railway public security police, and volunteer railway workers resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, firmly assure you: We will inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle, build the people's railways well, conscientiously carry out patriotic production competitions, implement the economic accounting system, continue to carry out rationalization proposals and create new record movements, improve transportation efficiency, reduce transportation costs, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's transportation tasks, so as to better play a supporting role in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. We must improve the quality of projects and accelerate the construction of new lines. We must heighten our vigilance, strictly prevent bandits and special agents, and protect railway property and traffic safety. We must strengthen our close unity with the Korean workers, overcome all difficulties, and keep transportation forever unblocked.

We, all the representatives, assure you: We will continue to humbly learn from the broad masses, and constantly improve our political, cultural, and technical level. We will never be arrogant or complacent, nor will we be slack in the slightest. We will consolidate and carry forward the existing achievements, and forever maintain the glorious title given to us by you and the people. We will be leaders of the masses, the core backbone of the masses, and a bridge between the leadership and the masses, and promote the victorious advance of the people's railway cause. We shout:

Long live the eternal victory of the people's liberation cause!

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party!

Long live our dearest leader and mentor, the great and wise Chairman Mao!

Offering Words to Commander-in-Chief Zhu

Respected Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

You came in person to attend and guide this conference despite your busy schedule, giving us many valuable instructions, which made us feel extremely excited! We, on behalf of all railway workers, fully accept your instructions and express our heartfelt gratitude to you!

We clearly know that we can have such glory today, first of all, we should attribute it to the leadership of the great and wise Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, who liberated the entire China from the dark rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and the working class gained the result of turning over. At the same time, without the heroic and strong People's Liberation Army created and led by Chairman Mao and you, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese people's revolutionary cause would not have developed so rapidly and achieved such brilliant and great victories. Therefore, on the occasion of the victorious opening of the conference today, we would like to pay our highest revolutionary salute to you on behalf of all railway workers!

At present, U.S. imperialism is still intensifying its aggression policy, using all kinds of shameless gangster tactics in the Korean armistice negotiations to obstruct and sabotage them. Recently, it also illegally signed a one-sided "peace treaty" with Japan. We railway workers must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold and vow to do our best, together with the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and you, to fight to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggression conspiracy!

Respected Commander-in-Chief Zhu, although we have achieved some successes in the past two years, this is only the beginning of building the people's railways, and we still have many difficulties and shortcomings. We will certainly follow your instructions, continue to work hard, and implement the spirit of your instructions into practical actions and among the broad masses of workers. We firmly assure you that we will do what you require, carefully summarize and learn advanced production experiences and working methods at this conference. Consolidate and carry forward the existing achievements, and never be arrogant or complacent. We must humbly learn from the masses and closely contact the masses. Play the role of "leader, backbone, and bridge" among the masses. Continue to improve our political, cultural, and professional level. We must lead the masses to work hard to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production and contribute donations. Widely and deeply carry out production competitions, thoroughly implement the patriotic convention. We must thoroughly implement the economic accounting system on the national railways, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's glorious tasks of transportation and new road construction, and contribute all our strength to building a strong national defense and economic power, and to consolidating our great motherland! We will forever maintain the glorious title given to us by the people and the country! Forever follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party to advance victoriously!

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Long live our respected Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Long live our leader and mentor, the most respected Chairman Mao!

    全国铁路劳动模范代表大会
    向毛主席朱总司令致敬向毛主席献辞敬爱的毛主席：
    中央人民政府铁道部和铁路工会全国委员会这次召开全国铁路劳动模范代表大会，我们五百名代表到首都来参加这个盛大的会议，受到热烈的欢迎和招待，我们感到莫大的光荣。
    在我们来京之前，同志们就再三嘱咐：要我们转达他们对您的敬意和怀念。我们谨在这里代表大家，问候您的健康，并向您致最崇高的敬礼！
    我们知道：没有您和共产党的英明领导，我们那有今天的光荣和幸福？想想过去，在蒋介石匪帮黑暗残暴的统治之下，我们工人受的苦真是一言难尽。挨骂、受气是常事，累死累活没人理；层层克扣、剥削，害得我们吃不饱、穿不暖，有了病就只好等死；动不动就拳打脚踢，一出厂就搜腰包，根本不把我们当人看待。
    在您和共产党的领导下，多少年来压在我们脑袋上的三座大山都给推翻了。尤其是自打中国有铁路那天起，就直接统治我们的美、英和日本鬼子的势力给撵走了，更使我们感到中国人民真是站起来了。
    看看如今，在您和共产党的领导下，我们工人完全变了样。我们这些在旧社会没地位的人，现在能够跟段长、厂长坐在一块儿商量生产和工作，好的意见都被采纳；在镇压反革命和民主改革运动中，坏人被压下去了，好人都顺了气了；人民政府所颁布的工会法和劳动保险条例，使我们的工作和生活都有了法律的保障；在目前抗美援朝的正义战争还未结束，国家财政状况仍然十分困难的条件下，领导上还是尽一切可能给我们适当解决福利问题。这一切事实都使我们深刻体验到真正翻身做了主人，做了国家的领导阶级。
    毛主席，是您和党教育了我们，现在谁也懂得干活是为了祖国、为了人民、同时也是为了自己。解放以前那种“磨洋工”“泡茅房”的现象早已没有了。现在大家是越干越起劲了；从前是材料随便浪费，机器坏了没人管，现在大家对机器和国家一切财产看得比自己生命还重要。不但如此，大家还开动脑筋，改进工具和工作方法，有了不少的发明和创造。
    解放以来，在您和党的领导下，我们在生产和工作上是做出了一些成绩的，但是我们并不以此为满足，我们工作上还存在着不少缺点，需要继续努力。
    目前，美帝国主义仍然野心不死，一面破坏开城谈判，一面单独对日媾和，阴谋侵略我们祖国和亚洲其他国家。为了保卫我们的胜利果实，打败美帝国主义的侵略计划，我们一定遵从您的指示，和全国人民在一起，为加速建设强大的国防力量和经济力量而奋斗。
    我们全体铁路职工、铁道兵团指战员、铁路公安纵队、铁路公安警察、志愿抗美援朝铁路职工向您坚决保证：我们要继承和发扬光荣的革命斗争传统，建设好人民铁路，认真开展爱国主义生产竞赛，贯彻实行经济核算制，继续开展合理化建议和创造新纪录运动，提高运输效率，减低运输成本，争取完成并超额完成本年度运输任务，更好地发挥在抗美援朝运动中的支援作用；我们要提高工程质量，加速新线路的建设；我们要提高警惕，严防土匪特务，保护铁路财产和行车安全；我们要加强与朝鲜职工的紧密团结，克服一切困难，使运输永远畅通。
    我们全体代表向您保证：我们一定继续虚心向广大群众学习，不断地提高政治、文化与技术水平。我们决不自高自大，也决不有一点松懈。我们要巩固和发扬已有的成绩，永远保持您和人民给予的光荣称号。我们要作群众的带头人、群众的核心骨干、领导与群众间的桥梁，推动人民铁路事业胜利前进。我们高呼：
    人民解放事业永远胜利万岁！
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    我们最亲爱的领袖和导师、伟大英明的毛主席万
    岁！

    向朱总司令献辞敬爱的朱总司令：
    您在百忙中亲来出席指导这次大会，给了我们许多宝贵指示，使我们感到万分的兴奋！我们代表全体铁路职工完全接受您的指示，向您表示衷心的感谢！
    我们清楚地知道：我们今天能有这样的光荣，首先应该归功于伟大英明的毛主席和共产党的领导，把全中国从帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的黑暗统治下解放出来，工人阶级获得了翻身的结果。同时，没有毛主席和朱总司令您所创造和领导的英勇坚强的人民解放军，中国人民的革命事业不会有这样迅速的发展和这样辉煌伟大的胜利。因此，在大会胜利开幕的今天，我们谨代表全体铁路职工向您致以崇高的革命敬礼！
    现在，美帝国主义仍然在加紧实行侵略政策，在朝鲜停战谈判中，用尽无耻的流氓手段，进行阻挠和破坏；最近，还非法签订了片面对日“和约”。我们铁路职工一定要百倍地提高警惕，誓以全力与中国人民解放军和全国人民一道，在毛主席和您的英明领导下，为打败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋而奋斗！
    敬爱的朱总司令，两年来我们虽然获得了一些成绩，但这仅是建设人民铁路的开始，我们还存在着不少困难和缺点。我们一定遵照您的指示，继续努力，把您指示的精神贯彻到实际行动和广大职工中去。我们坚决向您保证：我们一定做到您所要求的，在这次会上认真总结与学习先进生产经验和工作方法；巩固和发扬既有的成绩，决不骄傲自满；我们要虚心向群众学习，密切联系群众；在群众中起“带头、骨干和桥梁”作用；继续提高自己的政治、文化和业务水平。我们要带领群众，努力加强抗美援朝增产捐献运动；广泛深入地开展生产竞赛，澈底执行爱国公约；我们要在全国铁路澈底实行经济核算制，争取完成并超额完成今年的运输和新路建设的光荣任务，为建设强大的国防力量和经济力量，为巩固我们的伟大祖国，贡献出一切力量！我们要永远保持人民和国家给予我们的光荣称号！永远跟着毛主席跟着共产党胜利前进！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    我们敬爱的朱总司令万岁！
    我们的领袖和导师最敬爱的毛主席万岁！
