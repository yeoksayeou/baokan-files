    Our Committee to Defend Peace and Oppose American Aggression and Four Other Organizations
    Protest the Persecution of Japanese Communist Leaders by American and Japanese Reactionaries
    Support the Just Struggle of the Japanese Communist Party
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The China Peace Committee, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the All-China Youth Federation jointly issued a protest letter on the 8th of this month, protesting the illegal order by the American and Japanese reactionaries to arrest Japanese Communist leaders, and supporting the Japanese Communist Party's leadership of the Japanese people in their struggle for independence, democracy, and peace. The full text of the protest letter is as follows:
    The American imperialist occupation authorities and the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan, in order to accelerate the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, have carried out a frenzied suppression of the leaders of the Japanese people's peace, patriotic, and democratic movement, the Japanese Communist Party. On September 4th, they issued an illegal order to arrest Etsuro Shiino, chairman of the temporary central guidance department of the Japanese Communist Party, as well as acting chairmen Kenji Kawada, committee members Ichizo Suzuki, Ichizo Rinta, Fumio Sugimoto, and other communists and JCP Diet members Hiroaki Hosaka, Kentaro Yamabe, Yuichi Horie, Kazuo Fukumoto, Kazuyoshi Sunama, Ryuji Nishizawa, Kakuroku Hosokawa, Saburo Kimura, Eiichi Iwata, Iwao Iwamoto, Bunkichi Okada, Kanichi Kawakami, Susumu Uemura and 18 others. Among them, Eiichi Iwata, Kazuyoshi Sunama, Kentaro Yamabe, Kakuroku Hosokawa, Yuichi Horie, Kazuo Fukumoto, Susumu Uemura, and Kanichi Kawakami were arrested on the 4th. At the same time, the Japanese police also searched the JCP Central Headquarters and 25 JCP regional committees in Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, and other places. We, the people's organizations of China, express our utmost indignation and protest against this atrocity by the American and Japanese reactionaries.
    The Japanese Communist Party is the party of the Japanese proletariat and also the party representing the interests of the Japanese people and the Japanese nation. It is the main force in Japan opposing the Japanese militarist policy of aggression. During the Second World War, the Japanese Communist Party struggled under difficult conditions against the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China and other countries. Therefore, the Japanese Communist Party not only won the love and support of the Japanese people but also received the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world.
    After the defeat and surrender of Japanese imperialism, the Japanese Communist Party stood at the forefront of the Japanese people, making the greatest efforts to eliminate the fascist forces in Japan and establish a new Japan that is independent, democratic, and peaceful. Now, as American imperialism and the reactionary Yoshida government are accelerating the realization of a separate peace treaty with Japan, rearming Japan, and turning Japan into an American colony and a war base for aggression against China and Asia, the Japanese Communist Party has united patriotic and democratic people from all classes and strata in Japan, launching a widespread movement to defend Japan's national independence and world peace, and to oppose a separate peace treaty. This is a completely just action and is in the interest of the Japanese people and the people of the world. The arrests on September 4th prove that American imperialism and the reactionary Yoshida government want to use insane terror to force the Japanese people to accept the American-made treaty. This is yet another exposure of the ugly face of American imperialism and the traitorous stance of the reactionary Yoshida government.
    We, the Chinese people, have always given great sympathy and concern to the struggle of the Japanese Communist Party leading the Japanese people for independence, democracy, and peace. We firmly believe that the terrorist actions of the American and Japanese reactionaries cannot overwhelm the will of the Japanese people to strive for independence, democracy, and peace. Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese people, together with all peace-loving and democratic people in Asia and the world, will certainly be able to shoulder important responsibilities in the movement to defend lasting peace in the world and in Asia, and will ultimately establish a new Japan that is independent, democratic, and prosperous!

    我保卫和平反美侵略委员会等四团体
    抗议美日反动派迫害日共领袖
    支援日本共产党的正义斗争
    【本报讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会和中华全国民主青年联合总会四个人民团体，于本月八日联合发表抗议书，抗议美日反动派非法下令逮捕日共领袖，支援日本共产党领导日本人民为争取独立、民主与和平而进行的斗争。抗议书全文如下：
    美帝国主义占领军当局和日本反动派吉田政府，为加紧缔结单独对日和约、重新武装日本，对日本人民的和平、爱国、民主运动的领导者日本共产党，实行了疯狂的镇压，竟于九月四日发布非法命令，逮捕日本共产党临时中央指导部主席椎野悦郎以下代理主席河田贤治、委员铃木市藏、轮田一造、杉本文雄以及其他共产党员和日共国会议员保坂浩明、山边健太郎、堀江邑一、福本和夫、砂间一良、西泽隆二、细川嘉六、木村三郎、岩田英一、岩本岩、冈田文吉、川上贯一、上村进等十八人。其中岩田英一、砂间一良、山边健太郎、细川嘉六、堀江邑一、福本和夫、上村进、川上贯一等八人，已于四日被捕；同时，日本警察还搜查了日共中央本部、大阪、京都、兵库等共计二十五处的日共地区委员会。我们中国各人民团体，对于美日反动派的这一暴行，表示最大的愤慨和抗议。
    日本共产党是日本无产阶级的政党，也是代表日本人民、日本民族利益的政党。它是日本国内反对日本军国主义侵略政策的主要力量。在第二次世界大战期间，日本共产党为了反对日本帝国主义对中国及其他各国所进行的侵略战争，曾经在困难条件下进行了斗争，因此日本共产党不仅获得了日本人民的爱戴和拥护，也得到了中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情与支持。
    日本帝国主义战败投降以后，日本共产党又站在日本人民的前列，为肃清日本国内法西斯势力和建立独立、民主、和平的新日本，进行了最大的努力。现在，当美帝国主义和吉田反动政府正加紧实现对日单独媾和，重新武装日本，把日本变为美国殖民地和侵略中国与亚洲的战争基地的时候，日本共产党团结了日本各阶级各阶层的爱国民主的人士，发动了广泛的保卫日本民族独立与世界和平、反对单独媾和的运动，这是完全正义的行动，也是符合于日本人民和全世界人民利益的行动。九月四日的逮捕，证明美帝国主义和吉田反动政府想用疯狂的恐怖手段来强制日本人民接受美制和约。这是再一次地暴露美帝国主义的狰狞面目和吉田反动政府的卖国立场。
    我们中国人民，对于日本共产党领导日本人民为争取独立、民主与和平而进行的斗争，历来是寄予极大的同情和关怀的。我们深信：美日反动派的恐怖行动决不能压倒日本人民争取独立、民主与和平的意志。日本人民在日本共产党领导下，与全亚洲全世界爱好和平民主的人民在一起，在长期的艰苦的斗争中，一定能够在捍卫全世界全亚洲的持久和平的运动中担负起重要的责任，并在最后建立一个独立、民主、繁荣的新日本！
