    National environmental sanitation and sanitary engineering work has greatly developed in both urban and rural areas over the past two years.

    In urban sanitary engineering, according to available statistics, 57 cities nationwide now have tap water facilities, serving a total of 12.8 million people, accounting for 13 percent of the total population of these 57 cities. Six cities, including Changsha, Xinxiang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou, have started constructing or are planning to build tap water systems after liberation. Currently, 44 cities nationwide have sewage systems, with a total length of 4,660 kilometers. Major cities have specialized organizations responsible for sanitary engineering and sewage engineering. Beijing and Tianjin have even established Sanitary Engineering Bureaus. In the past two years, Beijing has built 105 kilometers of new sewers, constructed 1,330 sewage pools, renovated long-clogged river and lake systems in the city and suburbs, and built public swimming pools and labor bathhouses. Tianjin has built 30 kilometers of new sewers, exceeding the length of sewers built in the previous eleven years. The most significant feature of these construction projects is that they serve production and the working people. Longxugou in Beijing and Chilonghe in Tianjin are both areas where working people live. In the past, due to the accumulation of filthy water, gastrointestinal infectious diseases occurred almost every year. Now, new sewers have been built and the old ditches have been filled. As a result, the incidence of infectious diseases in these two areas has significantly decreased.

    Great achievements have been made in urban drinking water hygiene, sanitary management of food and beverages, toilet improvement, and fly eradication in cities such as Shanghai, Shenyang, Nanchang, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. As a result, the number of typhoid and dysentery patients in these cities has significantly decreased. In 1950, the average daily supply of disinfected drinking water in various cities reached 84,000 tons, ensuring safe drinking water for 4.6 million people. Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and other cities added tap water supply stations in impoverished areas during the summer, and Tianjin used water boats to supply free tap water to impoverished people along the coast. According to incomplete statistics, more than 4,219 improved drinking water wells have been built in rural areas. In 1951, 22 deep drinking water wells were drilled in the Northwest and North China regions, and dozens more are being drilled. The successful drilling of deep water wells has solved the drinking water difficulties for some ethnic minorities in Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia, and has played a role in stabilizing the lives of local residents.

    In terms of preventing insect-borne diseases, in addition to specialized prevention and control agencies handling plague and kala-azar, louse and mosquito eradication work has been carried out with emphasis in the past two years. In 1950, louse eradication work was carried out for 200,000 people, and in the first half of 1951, louse eradication work was carried out for 540,000 people. In disaster areas, areas where river workers congregate, and ethnic minority areas, epidemic prevention teams have carried out a large amount of louse eradication work, timely curbing the prevalence of typhus and relapsing fever. Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian, Baoding, and other places launched mass mosquito eradication campaigns last year. Dalian's mosquito eradication work was the most thorough. In 1949, the masses salvaged 2.5 tons of mosquito larvae. In 1948, 3,000 people in the area contracted encephalitis, but none occurred in 1949.

    Since liberation, large-scale clean-up campaigns have been launched across the country. In 1950, cities across the country cleared a total of 1.75 million tons of garbage. Garbage that had accumulated in some cities for decades was also cleaned up. In vast rural areas, sanitation publicity and education work has been carried out and clean-up campaigns have been conducted in the process of carrying out epidemic prevention campaigns and restoring and establishing rural health organizations. According to preliminary statistics, more than 14,000 toilets have been improved or built in various places in the past year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国环境卫生和卫生工程工作两年来有很大发展
    全国环境卫生和卫生工程工作，两年来在城市和农村都有很大的发展。
    在都市的卫生工程方面，据已有材料的统计，全国现有五十七个城市有自来水设备，供水人口总计有一千二百八十万，占五十七个城市总人口数的百分之十三；解放后开始建设或正在筹建自来水的有长沙、新乡、西安、兰州等六个城市。全国现有四十四个城市有下水道设备，下水道总长四千六百六十公里。较大的城市都有专门负责卫生工程及下水道工程的组织。北京、天津两地并成立了卫生工程局。北京市两年来新建下水道一百零五公里，修建污水池一千三百三十个，修整了市内和郊区淤塞很久的河湖水系，并建造了人民游泳池及劳动浴室。天津市新建下水道三十公里，超过以往十一年所建下水道的长度。这些建设工程最显著的特点是为生产服务和为劳动人民服务。北京龙须沟和天津赤龙河两处都是劳动人民聚居地区，过去因秽水聚积，几乎每年都发生肠胃系的传染病，现在已修建了新的下水道，把旧的河沟填垫了。该两地区的传染病的发病率因此显著地减低。
    都市的饮水卫生、饮食物的卫生管理、厕所改良以及灭蝇等工作在上海、沈阳、南昌、杭州、宁波等城市都有很大的成绩。因此这些城市的伤寒和痢疾患者已显著地减少。一九五零年各城市供应的消毒饮水平均每日达八万四千吨，保证了四百六十万人安全饮用。北京、上海、南京、武汉等市夏季均在贫民区增设自来水供水站，天津市并用水船免费向沿岸贫民供应自来水。农村中改良的饮水井，据不完全统计，已有四千二百十九眼。一九五一年西北及华北地区凿了饮水深井二十二眼，正在凿的尚有数十眼。深水井开凿的成功，使绥远、内蒙等地一部分少数民族人民的饮水困难得以解决，并且对当地居民起了安定生活的作用。
    在预防昆虫传染病方面，除了鼠疫、黑热病另有专业防治机构处理外，两年来并有重点地作了灭虱和灭蚊工作。一九五零年曾作了二十万人的灭虱工作，一九五一年上半年作了五十四万人的灭虱工作。在灾区、河工聚居地区和少数民族地区，都由防疫队进行了大量灭虱工作，及时遏止了斑疹伤寒与回归热的流行。北京、天津、旅大、保定等地，去年都发动了群众性的灭蚊工作。旅大的灭蚊工作作得最彻底，一九四九年群众打捞的孑孓有两吨半。该区一九四八年曾有三千人得大脑炎，一九四九年就一个也没有发生。
    解放以来，各地发动了大规模的清洁扫除运动。一九五零年全国各城市共清除垃圾一百七十五万吨。有些都市几十年所堆积的垃圾，也被清理干净了。广大的乡村，在开展防疫运动和恢复与建立农村卫生组织过程中都开展了卫生宣传教育工作，并进行了清扫运动。一年来各地改善或修建的厕所，据初步统计已有一万四千多处。（新华社）
