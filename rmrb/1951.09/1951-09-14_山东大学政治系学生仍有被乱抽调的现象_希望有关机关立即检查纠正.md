    Students in the Political Science Department of Shandong University are Still Being Randomly Transferred; Hope Relevant Authorities Will Immediately Inspect and Correct
    To the Editor:
    The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions to correct the chaotic phenomena in school education. We feel that this correct measure to protect the long-term interests of the country is very important.
    In Shandong Province, the chaotic phenomena in school education are also serious, and have not been completely corrected to this day. Taking the Political Science Department of Shandong University as an example, the arbitrary transfer of students to participate in work, creating a situation where students in school are not at ease in their studies, is very serious. For example, during the spring break this year, 38 students from the department were transferred out to participate in work, and then another 5 students were transferred out to participate in work. Moreover, some institutions lacked careful planning in advance when assigning work to the transferred students.
    Because many students are constantly being transferred to participate in work, some students in school cannot concentrate on their studies. Some believe: they may be transferred to work soon, so what's the point of long-term planning?
    This situation has not been completely corrected even after the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions. It is understood that recently several students from the Political Science Department of the school have been transferred to work.
    If this situation is not immediately corrected, our country will not be able to cultivate various construction talents according to a certain plan. We suggest that relevant departments conduct in-depth inspection and effective correction of this erroneous phenomenon.

    山东大学政治系学生仍有被乱抽调的现象
    希望有关机关立即检查纠正编辑同志：
    中共中央华东局已经发出了纠正学校教育中的混乱现象的指示。我们感到这种保护国家长远利益的正确措施是非常重要的。
    在山东省，学校教育工作的混乱现象也严重存在，并且到现在还没完全纠正。仅以山东大学政治系来说，任意抽调学生参加工作，造成在校学生不安心学习的现象是非常严重的。例如今年春假期间，该系一次就有三十八个学生被调出参加工作，后又继续抽出五人参加工作。而某些机关在分配调来的学生的工作时，事前缺乏周密的计划。
    由于很多同学不断被抽调参加工作，有些在校同学就不能安心学习。有的认为：可能不久就要被调去工作，长期打算个啥？
    这种情况，在中共中央华东局发出指示后还没完全纠正。据了解，最近该校政治系又有几位同学被调出工作。
    这种情况如果不即予纠正，将会使我们的国家无法按照一定的计划培养各种建设人材。我们建议有关部门对于这种错误现象进行深入的检查与有效的纠正。    幸之、金可
