    Tieling Granary Disregards Rainy Season Storage
    Moldy Grain Causes National Loss

    To the Editor:

    The Tieling Granary in Liaoxi Province is a warehouse directly under the Provincial Grain Bureau. It is large in scale, with sufficient storage and equipment to meet the needs of storage tasks, and has ample material conditions to ensure that the grain does not spoil. However, because the leaders of the granary did not pay attention to grain storage, 21 train cars of sorghum rice leaked from the stacks, most of over 50 train cars of paddy rice leaked from the stacks, and 42 train cars of sorghum in the open-air stacks leaked from the stacks, resulting in a total of 147,874 jin of moldy public grain.

    The reason for the moldy grain is that the granary did not pay attention to rainy season storage. They did not conduct thorough research when unloading the grain, thinking that covering it with mats would be enough. Therefore, some stacks were only covered with two layers of mats, and they did not consider the possibility of leakage in rainy weather.

    Du Chunshan, the director of the warehouse, did not pay enough attention to his work. Although he accepted the instructions from the county party committee to work in the countryside at the time, he did not explain to the county party committee that the rainy season was a critical period for grain storage, nor did he discuss and explain the work in detail with the deputy director, nor did he request approval from the Provincial Grain Bureau to leave his post (because it was a directly subordinate warehouse). After the grain spoiled, the head of the storage section reported to him by telephone, but he did not realize the seriousness of the incident, and delayed returning to the granary for five or six days. This shows that the responsible comrades of the Tieling Granary did not cherish national property and adopted a bureaucratic attitude, which caused great losses to the property of the state and the people. This lesson should arouse the vigilance of grain depot workers throughout the country to protect state property.

### 铁岭粮库不注意雨季保管  霉坏粮食造成国家损失

    铁岭粮库不注意雨季保管
    霉坏粮食造成国家损失编辑同志：
    辽西省铁岭粮库是省粮食局直属仓库，规模较大，库房及设备足够保管任务之需用，有保证不坏粮食的充分物质条件。但因该粮库领导同志对粮食保管不注意，致使二十一火车高粱米漏垛，五十余火车水稻大部漏垛，露天垛有高粱四十二火车漏垛，共计霉坏公粮十四万七千八百七十四斤。
    霉坏粮食的原因，是由于该粮库未注意雨季保管，在卸粮时没有周密研究，认为好坏苫上即可，所以有的垛只苫了两层席子，根本没有想到雨天有漏垛的可能。
    仓库主任杜春山对本身工作也重视不够，当时他虽接受县委的指示下乡工作，但未向县委说明雨季为粮食保管之严重时期，又未与副主任详细研究交代工作，更未向省粮食局请示批准离职（因系直属库）；坏粮后保管股长在电话中向他报告，他也没认识到事件的严重性，又延迟了五、六天才回粮库。这说明铁岭粮库的负责同志对国家资财不加爱护，采取官僚主义的态度，因而使国家与人民资财遭受很大损失。这一教训应引起全国各地粮库工作者警惕，以保护国家财产。
