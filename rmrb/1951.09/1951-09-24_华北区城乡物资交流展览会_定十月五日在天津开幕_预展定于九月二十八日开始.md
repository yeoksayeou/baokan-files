    To Open in Tianjin on October 5th
    Pre-exhibition Set to Begin September 28th
    [Our Dispatch] After more than two months of effort, the preparatory work for the North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition has been basically completed. On the 14th of this month, the exhibition preparatory committee held its second expanded meeting of the standing committee, deciding to begin the pre-exhibition in Tianjin on the 28th of this month, and officially open on October 5th.
    Up to now, the construction of the exhibition venue has been basically completed. More than 5,000 agricultural, sideline, local, and special products have been sent from various places as exhibits. More than 800 drawings have been completed, and the arrangement in the halls began on the 15th of this month. The purchase and sales plans of the five provinces and two cities of North China and Inner Mongolia have been sent to the conference. The purchase and sales plans of major administrative regions are also about to be fully delivered. Four exchanges have been established, and specific methods for transactions have been formulated.
    Currently, the focus of the preparatory committee's work is to conduct a comprehensive and systematic inspection. Three inspection teams for industry, agriculture, and local specialties have been formed under the General Office and began inspection on September 20th. The main purpose is to understand whether the arrangement of exhibits and various drawings and charts conform to the established principles and policies of the conference, whether the content of each exhibition hall is substantial, whether the safety work is strict, whether the purchase and sales plans are practical, and whether the reception work is adequately prepared, so as to prepare for all the opening work. In addition, the training of traders, commentators, and receptionists is being intensified.
    The preparatory committee has invited the leaders of the central, North China regional, North China five provinces and two cities, and Inner Mongolia to come to the meeting for guidance during the pre-exhibition. During the opening of the conference, more than 7,000 organized farmer representatives from various provinces in North China and Inner Mongolia will visit the conference. The five provinces and two cities of North China, Inner Mongolia, and major administrative regions have sent trade delegations composed of public and private industrial and commercial enterprises and cooperatives to conduct transactions at the conference. With the enthusiastic help of people from all walks of life in Tianjin, the conference has made full preparations for reception work in order to further communicate trade relations between regions and strengthen the unity of urban and rural people.
