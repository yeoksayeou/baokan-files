    Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team
    Checks and Revises Challenge Plan
    Summer Production Exceeds Target
    The mutual aid team led by Zhang Fugui, a famous labor model in Shandong Province, after checking the reasons why the spring production plan was not fully completed and improving it, has exceeded its summer production plan.
    This spring, when the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team responded to the challenge of the patriotic production competition launched by the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team in Shanxi Province, the local leading organs demanded too much of the team's challenge plan. In addition, Zhang Fugui himself spent too much time in various meetings, which led to the team's failure to fully complete its spring challenge plan. In mid-June, the Wendeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an in-depth inspection of the team and helped the team revise the challenge plan and summer production plan. The time Zhang Fugui spent going out to meetings was appropriately reduced, so that he could spend more time participating in and leading the team's production. As a result, the team originally planned to complete the summer harvest and planting in four days, but completed it in three days. During the summer harvest, the team also selected enough high-quality varieties in the fields for all 27.2 mu of wheat fields. The amount of summer fertilizer accumulated also exceeded the original plan by slightly less than 12 percent. The whole team has accumulated 377 carts of pure manure and green manure for autumn wheat planting. Moreover, because the team completed the plan for weeding and topdressing in the autumn fields, and actively controlled pests, the team's autumn crops also achieved a bumper harvest. The 22.4 mu of corn that has been harvested has a yield of 270-280 jin per mu. The four and a half mu of ambary hemp and one and six-tenths mu of Si-character cotton planted by Zhang Fugui also grew particularly well. Many farmers went to Fugui Village to visit and learn from Zhang Fugui's experience in planting hemp and cotton. Now the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team is busy with the autumn harvest and preparing for autumn planting in order to strive to complete the autumn production plan in a timely manner.
    In addition, the internal system of the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team has also been improved. For example, after the summer production plan was completed, the team quickly summarized, settled the work accounts, and formulated an autumn production plan, and established a "nightly meeting" for team members to conduct timely inspections, etc. (Xinhua News Agency)

    张富贵互助组
    检查修订应战计划
    夏季生产超额完成
    山东省著名劳动模范张富贵所领导的互助组，经过检查春季生产计划未能全部完成的原因，并予以改进后，夏季生产计划已超额完成。
    今年春天，张富贵互助组在响应山西省李顺达互助组开展爱国主义生产竞赛的挑战时，由于当地领导机关对该组的应战计划要求过高，加以张富贵本人的劳动时间又过多地被各种会议所占去，致使该组未能全部完成春季应战计划。六月中旬，中国共产党文登县委员会曾对该组进行了深入检查，同时帮助该组重新修订了应战计划和夏季生产计划，适当减少了张富贵外出开会的时间，使他能够以更多的时间参加和领导全组的生产。这样，该组原计划四天完成夏收夏种，结果三天就完成了。夏收中，该组并在田间穗选了足够全组二十七亩二分麦田种籽的优良品种。夏季积肥的数量也超过了原计划百分之十二弱。全组已为秋季种麦积下了三百七十七车净粪和绿肥。而且，由于该组完成了秋田锄草和施追肥的计划，并积极除治害虫，全组秋季作物也获得了丰收。已收割完的二十二亩四分玉米，每亩产量达二百七、八十斤。张富贵种的四亩半洋麻和一亩六分斯字棉也长得特别好，好多农民都到富贵村去参观和学习张富贵种植麻、棉的经验。现张富贵互助组正忙着秋收和准备秋种，以争取及时完成秋季生产计划。
    此外，张富贵互助组的内部制度也有了一些改进。如夏季生产计划完成后，该组即迅速进行总结，清算工账，并订出了秋季生产计划，建立了组员“每晚碰头会”，及时进行检查等。（新华社）
