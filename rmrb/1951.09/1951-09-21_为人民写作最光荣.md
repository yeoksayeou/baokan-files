Writing for the People is the Most Glorious

“It always comes back to one's profession.” Someone asked me what I thought of the second National Day, and I would like to start with my own work (literature and art); it is easier to talk intimately about one's own profession.

Before liberation, when I wrote things, I paid the most attention to whether they were well-written. How did I judge whether they were good or not? Beautiful writing was good, interesting stories were good; otherwise, they were not good.

Now, after nearly two years of observation and study, when I pick up a pen, I pay the most attention to whether what I write is correct.

The shift from good or bad to right or wrong is a rather large one. The former is a matter of technique, the latter is a matter of thought. It is more difficult to learn and understand thought than technique. Those with technique but no thought are mere stylists, while those with both technique and thought are true literary artists. There are great works of literature and art in the world with less-than-perfect technique, but there are no great works that are not profound in thought.

This understanding of literary quality, and the transformation of my style, cannot come from "How to Write a Novel" or "A Guide to Writing Plays," but only from observing and loving the new society. I am somewhat clever, but not very much. I often have difficulty understanding highly theoretical works. For me, facts are more persuasive than theory. Good or bad facts not only make me think, but also move me, making me love or hate. Emotional excitement is often the starting point of my writing. In the past two years, how many new heroes and new things have emerged in society! I am constantly moved. I have indeed seen and heard revolutionary facts with my own eyes and ears. I have touched the revolution with my own hands! I can no longer doubt or fail to understand the principles of revolution; the facts of revolution are already before my eyes! I can no longer only care about beautiful writing and interesting stories, but must write down the facts I have seen, with enthusiasm through thought, to expand the influence of supporting the government and consolidating the victory of the revolution.

In this way, I must first require myself to write "correctly," and then require myself to write "well"; if the principles are wrong, the more beautiful the writing and the more interesting the story, the greater the harm! Right and good is truly good; wrong is no good.

From the new facilities I have seen in the past two years, I have found a basic principle: no matter how complex things are, no matter how many different things there are on the surface, if you look closely, you can see that in their essence, they are all serving the people. Once I understood this, I also understood that literature and art must also serve the people; to serve the people, my works must state the principles correctly. In this new society, there is no "freedom of speech" to talk nonsense or violate the interests of the people; nor is it allowed to use beautiful writing and interesting stories to secretly spread poison! Today, a writer must use his best skills and greatest enthusiasm to write the most correct principles.

In these two years, I have written a lot of things. Some of them are very correct, some are not very correct, some are generally correct, but the details are not correct. On this good day of the second National Day, I am willing to frankly say: I am proud of what I have written correctly. I am not discouraged by what I have not written very correctly; I know that as long as I am willing to humbly accept criticism, society will allow me to reform myself. For things that are correct in the big picture but incorrect in the small details, I must be more careful in the future and write meticulously. Perhaps some people will say: "Isn't it too hard, too forced, too unpleasant for you to be so conscientious?" I said: "Truth is not discounted! If you see the truth and are unwilling to work hard and reluctantly pursue and uphold it, how can you make progress? The pursuit of truth is bound to be painful, how can it not be reluctant? Could it be that truth can be as easy as buying a sesame seed cake? As for whether it is pleasant or not, it depends on your own attitude. If you are willing to stand on the same line as the people and write works that are sufficient to serve the people, how pleasant that would be! Is there anything in the world more glorious and pleasant than being praised by the people? Conversely, if you think in your heart that you are clever and the people are confused, and that it is not worth writing for them; then, sir, I guarantee you will never be happy! The 'lonely man' standing outside the people is the most miserable person!"

    为人民写作最光荣
    “三句话不离本行。”有人问我对第二届国庆节有什么感想，我愿意由自己的工作（文艺）说起；自己本行的事容易说得亲切些。
    解放以前，我写东西，最注意写得好不好。拿什么去判断好不好呢？文字漂亮就好，故事有趣就好；反之，就不好。
    现在，经过差一点满二年的观察与学习，拿起笔来，我最注意写得对不对。
    由好不好到对不对是个相当大的转变。前者是技巧问题，后者是思想问题。思想比技巧更难学好搞通。有技巧而没思想的是八股匠，有技巧也有思想的才是文艺作家。世界上有技巧不甚高的伟大文艺作品，而没有思想不精深的伟大作品。
    我这一点对文艺品质的认识，与我的作风的转变，不能来自《小说作法》或《写剧指南》，而只能来自对新社会的观察与热爱。我有些聪明，但是不大。我往往念不明白理论高深的著作。对于我，事实比理论有更大的说服力量。好的或坏的事实不但使我去思索，也使我受感动，去喜爱或憎恨。感情的激动往往是我写作的起因。二年来，社会上出了多少新英雄，多少新事情！我经常受着感动。我确是亲眼看见，亲耳听见了革命的事实。我亲手摸到了革命！我没法再怀疑、再不明白革命的道理，革命的事实已都摆在我的眼前！我不能再只顾文字的漂亮，故事的有趣，而须把我自己看见的事实，热诚的通过思想写出来，去扩大拥护政府和巩固革命胜利的影响。
    这样，我必须要求自己写得“对”，而后再要求写得“好”；道理说错，文字越漂亮，故事越有趣，才为害越大！对而且好，才算真好；不对，就不好。
    从我在二年来所看到的新设施，我找出一条基本的道理来：无论事情怎么复杂，无论在表面上事情与事情有多少不同的地方，只要细看，就能看出来，在骨头里都是为人民服务。看清楚这一点，我也就明白了，文艺也必须为人民服务；要为人民服务，我的作品里就必须把道理说对了。在这个新社会里不准有胡说八道，违反人民利益的“言论自由”；也不准利用漂亮的文字，有趣的故事，偷偷的散放毒气！在今天，一个作家必须要拿出最好的本领，最大的热情，去写那顶对的道理。
    在这二年里，我写了不少东西。其中有的写得很对，有的不很对，有的大体上对，而细节不对。在第二届国庆节这个好日子，我愿意坦白的说出来：写得对的，我引以为荣。写得不很对的，我并不灰心；我知道只要我肯虚心的接受批评，社会上就允许我改过自新。大处对，小处不对的，以后我也须更加小心，一笔不苟的去写作。也许有人说：“你这样兢兢业业，不是太辛苦，太勉强，太不痛快了吗？”我说：“真理是不打折扣的！看到真理，而不肯辛苦地，勉强地，去追求，去拥护，怎能有长进呢？追求真理是必定有痛苦的，怎能不勉强？难道真理能像买个烧饼那么容易么？至于痛快不痛快，那就要看你自己的态度了。假若你肯和人民立在一条线儿上，写出足以为人民服务的作品，那该是多么痛快的事呢！天下还有比受到人民的夸赞更光荣，更痛快的事么？反之，你从心里头就以为你自己高明，人民糊涂，值不得为他们写作；那，先生，我管保你永远不会痛快！立在人民外边的‘孤家寡人’是最痛苦的人！”
