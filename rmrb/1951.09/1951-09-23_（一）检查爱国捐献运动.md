    (I) Inspect the Patriotic Donation Campaign

    The patriotic donation campaign in various regions has been underway for over three months. There are also three months left until the deadline at the end of the year. The leading organs of Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei Province have promptly inspected the situation of the donation campaign and discovered and resolved a number of urgent problems. This approach is very necessary. All regions should follow the example of Tangshan Prefecture and conduct an inspection of the donation campaign.

    The donation campaign, based on the patriotism of the broad masses of people, has achieved great success. As of the 21st, the number of aircraft pledged nationwide has reached 2,481, along with 128 artillery pieces, 80 anti-aircraft guns, and 4 tanks. The amount of money paid has reached over 877.6 billion yuan. The amount of money paid has also increased rapidly recently. However, the development of the campaign is uneven. Comparing the current amount of money paid with the total value of pledged weapons, it is only one-fifth of the total donations. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, but should continue to strengthen the leadership of the campaign, earnestly inspect the development of the campaign, and conscientiously correct various laissez-faire phenomena in the leadership of the donation campaign, so as to elevate the campaign to a higher level.

    The first item of inspection should be whether the development of the donation campaign has reached a universal and balanced state among various regions and units. Now, the donation campaign, which lasts for half a year, is halfway through, and the campaign has not yet been universally launched in some places. For example, in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, the campaign has not been launched in 160 out of 580 villages. The population and economic conditions of Zunhua and Luannan counties are similar, but the number of pledges and payments in Zunhua is less than one-tenth of that in Luannan County. The industrial and commercial circles in some cities have also pledged much less than other cities, in terms of their economic conditions. This is a very noteworthy phenomenon. In these places, serious inspections should be carried out, and patriotic propaganda and education work should be carried out in a timely manner, in order to overcome this backward state. Secondly, check the ratio of payments to pledges and study whether various regions and sectors have maintained a normal amount of payments. According to the Southern Daily, as of August 20, the amount of money paid by the industrial and commercial circles in Guangzhou was only one-eighth of the pledged amount, while workers and students had reached more than one-third. Other regions and units also have this backward phenomenon in payment work. If the reasons for this are not thoroughly investigated and solutions are not found, the payment work will inevitably become loose at the beginning and tight at the end, with the vast majority of payments being made in a short period of time, which may have a detrimental impact on the timely completion of the donation plan.

    The second inspection item is: whether the voluntary principle has been implemented in the donation campaign on the basis of patriotic education. It is necessary to carefully study the methods used by various regions, sectors, and units to lead the donation campaign, and check whether there are phenomena of forced quotas or disguised quotas. Although the phenomena of coercion and command that have occurred in various places are not universal, the existence of this phenomenon is serious and must be thoroughly inspected and strictly corrected. The Xiangxi District Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions at the end of August, requiring its subordinates to review and immediately correct the tendency of coercion and command, which is completely necessary. After conducting inspections, various regions should also formulate feasible correction measures.

    The third inspection item is the implementation of the increased production donation plan, and the study of successful experiences and failures, in order to ensure the realization of the plan. Some places have relaxed their leadership after formulating an increased production donation plan, neither solving problems in the implementation of the plan nor conducting supervision and inspection, resulting in the implementation of the donation plan falling into a state of laissez-faire. Some organs do not even know how much money their subordinate units have paid, how much has not been paid, and when the task can be completed. This situation cannot continue to exist. There are still more than three months before the completion of the donation campaign. Various regions and sectors should strengthen the planning of donation work and strive to complete the donation task by the end of November or early December.

### （一）检查爱国捐献运动

    （一）检查爱国捐献运动
    各地爱国捐献运动，到现在已经进行了三个多月。距离年底的完成期限，也还有三个多月。河北唐山专区的领导机关及时地检查了捐献运动的状况，发现和解决了若干急迫的问题，这种作法十分必要。各地都应该仿照唐山专区的作法，对捐献运动作一次检查。
    建立在广大人民爱国主义基础上的捐献运动，已经获得很大成绩。截至二十一日止，全国认捐的飞机已达二千四百八十一架，大炮一百二十八门，高射炮八十门，坦克四辆，交款已达八千七百七十六亿余元。交款数字最近也迅速增加。但是运动的发展并不平衡，拿现在的交款数字与认捐武器的总值来比较，仅为捐献总值的五分之一。因此，决不能满足于已有的成绩，而应当继续加强对运动的领导，切实检查运动的发展状况，认真纠正在捐献运动领导上的各种自流现象，把运动提高一步。
    检查内容的第一项，应是捐献运动的发展在各个地区和各个单位之间是否已经达到普遍、平衡的地步。现在，以半年为期的捐献运动，时间已经过去了一半，有些地方的运动还没有普遍展开。如河北丰润县的五百八十个村中，就有一百六十个村的运动没有搞起来。遵化与滦南两县的人口与经济条件相差不多，而遵化的认捐数字与缴款数字都不到滦南县的十分之一。有些城市的工商界按其经济状况来说，也比其他城市的认捐数字低得很多。这是很值得注意的现象。在这些地方，应该进行认真的检查，并抓紧时间认真开展爱国主义的宣传教育工作，以便克服这种落后状态。其次，检查交款数字与认捐数字的比例，研究各地、各界是否保持了正常的交款数量。据南方日报载，截至八月二十日止，广州工商界的交款数字还只等于认捐数字的八分之一，而工人、学生则达到了三分之一以上。其他地区和单位也存在着这种交款工作的落后现象。如不切实检查其中的原因，找出解决问题的办法，势必使交款工作弄得前松后紧，使绝大部分交款挤在短时间内交纳，这对于捐献计划的按期完成可能发生有害影响。
    第二个检查内容是：捐献运动是否在爱国主义教育的基础上贯彻了自愿原则。要仔细研究各地、各界、各单位领导捐献运动的方法，检查是否存在着强迫摊派或变相摊派的现象。目前各地所发生的强迫命令现象，虽然不是普遍的，但这种现象的存在却是严重的，必须加以切实检查，严格纠正。中共湘西区党委已于八月末发出指示，要求所属对强迫命令偏向加以检讨，立即纠正，这是完全必要的。各地在进行检查后，也应该定出可行的纠正办法。
    第三个检查内容是增产捐献计划的执行情况，研究成功的经验和失败的教训，以保证计划的实现。有些地方在订立增产捐献计划后，就放松了领导，既不解决执行计划中的问题，也不进行督促检查，致使捐献计划的执行陷于自流。有些机关甚至对所属单位究竟交纳了多少捐款，还有多少不曾交纳，何时可以完成任务，全然不知。这种状况是不能继续存在下去的。现在距离捐献运动的完成期限还有三个多月，各地、各界均应加强捐献工作的计划性，争取在十一月底或十二月初完成捐献任务。
