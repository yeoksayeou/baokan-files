Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 4th. The Nanjing Military Control Commission issued an order on the 4th of this month to permanently expel the imperialist element, Monaco national Antonio Riberi, from the country, and the Nanjing Public Security Bureau will execute it immediately. According to sources familiar with the matter, Li Peili's main crimes include the following:

    Colluding with the American-Chiang Kai-shek Gang to Participate in the Anti-People War

    Li Peili came to China from the Vatican in December 1946 under the name of "Envoy of the Holy See." At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were actively expanding the civil war, staging the bogus National Assembly and formulating the bogus constitution in Nanjing. Li Peili flattered the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in every possible way, praising the bogus constitution as "an explanation of China's political progress." He also said that the anti-people war waged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits was "continuing to lead the great cause of nation-building and moving towards a civilized future."

    In 1947, when Li Peili went to various dioceses for "inspection," he actively incited Catholics to support Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war. He said, "My mission to China is to assist the government in completing the work of 'national rejuvenation'." He called on Catholics to "concentrate their efforts and maintain close contact with the government." In the autumn of the same year, the People's Liberation Army turned to attack the Chiang Kai-shek army. Li Peili, closely following the American imperialist Wedemeyer, personally rushed to Beiping and Shenyang, and was sent to Changchun by a U.S. military plane. Five days later, he flew to Taiyuan, which was then surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, to organize Catholic priests and Catholics to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people war.

    Li Peili instructed and funded the Belgian Jesuit spy Raymond de Jaeghei to organize the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" (also known as the "People's Self-Defense Corps," "People's National Construction Promotion Association") special armed organization in North China, directly participating in Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people war.

    Covering up the espionage activities of American spy agencies

    Li Peili had close ties with many American spies in China. Here are two examples.

    One of the main culprits in the American spy case recently uncovered in Beijing, the Italian priest Tarciscio Martina, was the so-called "representative of the Holy See Envoy" stationed in Beijing by Li Peili. Martina used his religious profession as a cover to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities and collect military intelligence for Li Peili. According to Martina's confession: "In June 1947, I reported to Li Peili at Naizifu what places in Yixian and Laishui counties had the Eighth Route Army"; thereafter, "I supplied Li Peili with more than ten pieces of information in writing about the Siping Street battle, Fushun, Chahar, Xuanhua, Jiamusi, and other places."

    Under the command of Colonel David Dean Barrett, the military attache of the former U.S. Embassy in China stationed in Beiping, and the Italian Antonio Riva, a U.S. government spy, Martina directly participated in the heinous plan to conspire to harm our country's leaders. The criminal has now been captured by our public security organs and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Military Tribunal of the Beijing Military Control Commission.

    When Martina was arrested, 259 rounds of mortar shells, rifle bullets, and pistol bullets, eight hand grenades, mortar shell warheads and primers, 273 pieces of ordnance parts, and multiple drafts of intelligence he collected for Li An Dong and Li Peili were found hidden in his residence at No. 6 Jia, Naizifu, the "Representative Office of the Holy See Envoy to China in Beijing."

    The American spy priest Francisxav Ford, who was arrested in Meixian, Guangdong, in April of this year, also had a close relationship with Li Peili.

    On July 18, 1947, Ford, on the orders of Li Peili, sent Xu De, a traitor priest from the Jining Diocese in Mongolia, to Singapore. A letter from Ford to the Bishop of Malacca, seized from Ford's residence, stated:

    "Father Xu De from the Jining Diocese in Mongolia is one of the seven Chinese missionaries sent to me last year by the Papal Nuncio (i.e., Li Peili). Throughout the Japanese occupation, he represented the bishop in dealings with the Japanese authorities, which aroused the particular resentment of the Communists, who accused him of colluding with the enemy. His bishop advised him to seek refuge in an area without Communists, and the nuncio arranged for him to come to this area."

    Planning and organizing illegal reactionary secret organizations

    "The Legion of Mary"

    In August 1948, Li Peili transferred the Irish priest William A. McGrath to Tianjin to assist the French imperialist element Wen Guibin in organizing the North China leadership organ of the Legion of Mary; later, he sent Mo Keqin to Guangzhou, Guilin, Sichuan and other places to develop this reactionary organization. The task of this organization was to carry out conspiratorial activities against the People's Government in various parts of our country, including collecting intelligence and organizing terrorist incidents. They said to the mad reactionary elements: The Americans and Chiang Kai-shek must return at the end of this year, you boldly do it. In 1949, Li Peili wrote to Chen Zhemin, the translator of the "Legion of Mary Handbook," saying: "Today's China, because of the tragic situation, the possibility of hierachical evangelization has been reduced to a minimum. In many places, it has disappeared." Li Peili here is clearly instigating Catholics to oppose the People's Government, thereby developing his reactionary organization. In 1950, Li Peili instructed Pei Xiaoyuan (A. Palmers, a Belgian priest), the vicar of the Nanjing Diocese, to actively develop the Nanjing Legion of Mary. On July 2 of the same year, that is, after American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, at the inaugural meeting of the Nanjing "Legion of Mary" District Council, Li Peili personally delivered a speech saying: "The situation has changed, the darkness before dawn has passed, and there will definitely be changes at the end of this year."

    Inciting Chinese Catholics to oppose the Chinese
    People's Revolutionary Movement and the People's Government

    Li Peili repeatedly issued various orders and instructions hostile to our country's People's Government to Chinese Catholics, forbidding Chinese Catholics from participating in patriotic activities and democratic organizations, and forbidding Catholics from reading patriotic books and newspapers. The following are excerpts of these reactionary orders and instructions:

    1. On February 16, 1947, Li Peili issued the Papal Nunciature in China - Instruction No. 1 of the Department of Theology "Catholic groups or individuals must not participate in reactionary organizations," the main content of which is as follows:

    "It has been found that after the end of the Great War, the following three groups have been expanding day by day, which are worthy of our attention:
        (1) International Women's Democratic Association
        (2) World Federation of Trade Unions
        (3) World Youth Democratic Association
        (Editor's Note: The names of the three groups listed by Li Peili in this reactionary "instruction" are actually malicious transliterations of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Trade Unions, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth.)

    The strength of these three groups is gradually increasing, and their various activities are quite suspicious. The Holy See of Rome, according to reliable information, knows that the ideology of these three groups is a re-enactment of communist thought, just like three groups of brigades of the same nature, promoting the popularization of communist theory throughout the world. Therefore, all our Catholic groups must not collude with the above organizations, and must avoid supporting their causes."

    2. After the liberation of Nanjing, he again issued the "Order of the Roman Congregation for the Clergy" on July 1, 1949, in the name of "Envoy of the Holy See," the main content of which is as follows:
        "(1) It is illegal to join the Communist Party or express enthusiasm for the Communist Party. Although the leaders of the Communist Party claim that they do not oppose religion, in fact, in theory or in practice, they clearly show that they are hostile to God, true religion, and the church of God.
        (2) It is illegal, and should be prohibited by law, to publish, publicize, or read books, magazines, and newspapers containing the theories or actions of Communists, or to write articles in those publications.
        (3) Catholics who have arbitrarily done the above two things, according to the usual principles, those with improper character, shall not participate in the Holy Communion.
        (4) Catholic believers who believe in the communist materialistic anti-religious theory, especially those who defend and promote this theory, as Catholic believers, shall unconditionally be subject to the special punishment of being expelled from the church by the Holy See."

    3. Li Peili again issued a "warning" from the "Roman Congregation for the Clergy" on July 28, 1950, in the name of "Envoy of the Holy See," the content of which is as follows:
        "Everyone knows that under the instructions and sponsorship of the Communist Party, some organizations have been established, which aim at instilling materialistic theoretical systems and attacking Christian morality into young men and women.
    Therefore, Christians belonging to such organizations, regardless of the name under which they are covered, will suffer the sanctions mentioned in the order issued by the Department of Theology on July 1, 1949.
        (1) Parents or their agents, who freely join the above-mentioned organizations in violation of the provisions of Article 2 of Canon C. 1372 of the above-mentioned Ministry of Theology, shall lose their qualifications to receive holy canons.
    (2) Those who educate young men and women in violation of Christian morality and faith shall be subject to the special punishment of being expelled from the church.
    (3) Any man or woman who participates in such organizations shall lose their qualification to obtain holy canons."

    Li Peili reissued this reactionary document this year, and pointed out in these documents that Chinese Catholics can only obey the "Vatican" and "church superiors," that is to say, Chinese Catholics can only obey spies like Li Peili, Madinuo, and Lei Zhenyuan, and traitors like Yu Bin and Xu De, and must not obey the laws of the People's Government of China.

    In the confession of Ma Dinou, one of the main culprits in the spy case recently uncovered in Beijing, he also admitted that "I have conveyed Li Peili's religious instructions to the Catholic churches in North China," "These instructions are all aimed at creating the terrorist policy of the Eighth Route Army. When the opportunity arises, preach to the Catholics and slander the Eighth Route Army from the sidelines, resolutely opposing the people."

    Sabotaging the patriotic activities of patriotic Catholics in various places

    In the nationwide movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending our homes and defending our country, Catholics in various places have launched patriotic movements to participate in resisting America, aiding Korea, and opposing the manipulation and utilization of the Chinese Catholic Church by imperialism. Li Peili was extremely hostile to this movement and spared no effort to sabotage it by various despicable means.

    Li Peili instructed the Catholic Affairs Promotion Committee (also known as the Catholic Central Bureau, the original is Catholic Central Bnreau), which he directly commanded, to print and distribute in Shanghai a large number of books and periodicals that undermine the prestige of the government, sow discord between Catholics and the government, and slander the patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics, such as the "Learning Reference" and "Holy and Catholic Church" that have been exposed in newspapers in various places, and also published foreign language publications "Missionary Series" and "Missionary Research," etc., to spread Li Peili's reactionary orders and instructions, deceive and cover up Catholics and threaten the patriotic movement of Catholics in various places.

    He also instructed Jean DeVienne, the former Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese, to draft a "Statement of All Catholic Bishops in China," which he approved and distributed to bishops in various places. In this document, he attempted to coerce bishops in various places to sign by virtue of their religious status, in order to achieve the purpose of undermining the patriotic movement of Catholics.

    Between 1950 and 1951, Li Peili twice signed orders on the punishment of Catholics who attacked the theocracy. The purpose of this order was to attempt to threaten patriotic bishops, priests, and Catholics with the means of "removing the theocracy" and "expelling them from the church," and not allow them to express support for the People's Government.

    Also, on January 29 of this year, Li Peili's instructions to Theodore Orck Buddenb, the German Catholic Bishop of Lanzhou, said:

    "In all superficial matters, Chinese priests can be allowed to execute in your name, but in reality all power still belongs to you."

    From here, it can be seen that Li Peili attempted to use Chinese bishops and priests as puppets, while tightly grasping the real power in the hands of imperialist elements and never letting go. However, Li Peili's various conspiracies could not undermine the patriotic movement of Catholics. Even the Catholics in Nanjing, where Li Peili resided, organized and issued a patriotic declaration. Angered by this matter, Li Peili issued a notice to the bishops of all districts in the country, openly referring to the patriotic people of China as "enemies," attempting to instigate the entire congregation and clergy to confront the patriotic movement of patriotic Catholics. The content of this notice is as follows:

    "Today, March 31, the Nanjing newspaper published a declaration, which is said to have been signed by the priests and Catholics of this archdiocese. I am deeply saddened, and I hasten to inform you that I was not aware of the formulation of the declaration, and I cannot agree with this declaration.

    I earnestly pray to the Holy Spirit to grant all Catholics, especially the entire clergy, the necessary enlightenment and courage to clearly discern and bravely overcome the enemy's tricks, for the honor of the Holy Mother Church and the Pope."

    Li Peili later explained this notice, saying: "What I particularly disagree with is because the wording contains the Pope's interference in the internal affairs of the country and the Catholics' opposition to the local church superiors - Archbishop Yu Bin."

    The above concrete facts have irrefutably proved that Li Peili is a thorough and complete imperialist element in religious garb who carries out destructive activities against our new China. His mission is to organize espionage activities in China and to coerce Chinese Catholics to support American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek and to hate the People's Government, thereby actually undermining the Chinese People's Government.

    黎培里的主要罪行
    【新华社南京四日电】南京市军事管制委员会于本月四日发布命令，将帝国主义分子摩纳哥侨民黎培里（Antonio  Riberi）永远驱逐出国境，并由南京市公安局立即执行。据记者自关系方面获悉，黎培里的主要罪行包括下列各项：
    勾结美蒋匪帮参与反人民战争
    黎培里于一九四六年十二月以“罗马教廷”公使的名义由梵蒂冈来到我国，当时正是蒋匪积极扩大内战，在南京搬演伪国大、制定伪宪法的时候。黎培里向蒋匪百般献媚，歌颂伪宪法为“中国政治进步的说明”。又说蒋匪所进行的反人民的战争是：“继续领导建国大业，向文明前程迈进。”
    一九四七年，黎培里赴各教区“巡视”时，积极煽动教徒支持蒋介石反人民内战。他说：“本人被派驻中国的使命是在协助政府完成‘民族复兴’的工作”。他号召教徒“集中力量与政府密切联系”。同年秋，人民解放军转入对蒋匪军的进攻，黎培里紧接美国帝国主义者魏德迈之后亲自赶到北平和沈阳，并由美军专机送到长春，五天以后，又飞到当时正被人民解放军包围着的太原，组织天主教的神甫和教徒参加蒋匪的反人民战争。
    黎培里指示并资助天主教中比籍间谍分子雷震远（Raymond  de
  Jaeghei）在华北组织“公教青年报国团”（又称“民众自卫团”、“民众建国协进会”）特务武装组织，直接参加了蒋匪反人民的战争。
    掩护美国特务机关的间谍分子
        进行破坏活动
    黎培里和在中国的许多美国间谍都有密切联系。以下是两个例子。
    最近北京市破获的美国间谍案主犯之一意籍神甫马迪懦（Tarciscio  Martina）就是黎培里派驻北京的所谓“教廷公使代表”。马迪懦以宗教职业为掩护，进行反革命破坏活动，并为黎培里搜集军事情报。据马迪懦供：“一九四七年六月，在乃兹府曾向黎培里报告了易县、涞水县什么地方有八路军”；其后“又以书面的四平街战役，抚顺、察哈尔、宣化、佳木斯等地情报十多件，供给黎培里”。
    马迪懦在前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官包瑞德（Colonel  David  Dean  Barrett）及美国政府间谍意大利人李安东（Antonio  Riva）指挥下，直接参加阴谋危害我国领袖的罪恶计划。该犯现已被我公安机关捕获，并经北京市军事管制委员会军法处判处无期徒刑。
    马迪懦被捕时，在其所住乃兹府甲六号“罗马教廷驻华公使驻北京代表”寓所内，搜出他所隐藏的迫击炮弹、步枪子弹、手枪子弹等二百五十九发，手榴弹八枚，迫击炮弹弹头和底火、兵器零件等二百七十三件，以及他为李安东、黎培里搜集的情报底稿多件。
    今年四月，在广东梅县捕获的美籍间谍神甫福尔德（Francisxav
  Ford）也与黎培里有密切关系。
    一九四七年七月十八日，福尔德奉黎培里之命将蒙古集宁教区的汉奸神甫许德送往新加坡。从福尔德住所搜获的一封福尔德给马拉沙（Malacca）主教的信件中说：
    “由蒙古集宁教区来的许德神甫是去年教廷公使（按即黎培里）送到我这里来的七位华籍传教士中的一个，在整个日本占领期内，他一直代表主教与日本当局往来，这就招致了共产党的格外愤恨，于是指摘他通敌。他的主教劝他到没有共产党的地区去避难，公使才安排他到这区来。”
        策划组织非法反动秘密团体
    “圣母军”
    黎培里于一九四八年八月调爱尔兰籍神甫莫克勤（William  A．McGrath）到天津协助法籍帝国主义分子文贵宾，组织圣母军的华北领导机关；其后又派莫克勤到广州、桂林、四川等地去发展这个反动组织。这个组织的任务是在我国各地进行反对人民政府的阴谋活动，包括搜集情报和组织恐怖事件，这就是向疯狂的反动分子们说：美国人和蒋介石在今年年底，一定要回来，你们大胆地干吧。一九四九年黎培里致书“圣母军手册”译者陈哲敏说：“今天的中国因为悲惨的时局，圣统传教的可能性已经减到最低限度，在好多地方，已经消灭了。”黎培里在这里显然是在挑拨天主教徒反对人民政府，从而发展他的反动组织。一九五○年黎培里又指使南京教区副主教裴效远（A．Palmers比籍神甫）积极发展南京圣母军。同年七月二日，即美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜战争之后，在南京“圣母军”区会成立大会上，黎培里亲临致训词说：“形势已变，黎明前黑暗已经过去，今年年底定有变化。”
        煽动中国天主教徒反对中国
    人民革命运动和人民政府
    黎培里迭次向中国天主教徒发出各种敌视我国人民政府的命令和指示，不许中国天主教徒参加爱国活动和民主团体，不许天主教徒阅读爱国的书籍和报纸。兹将这些反动命令和指示择其重要者摘录如下：
    一、一九四七年二月十六日黎培里发布教廷驻华公使馆——蒂字第一号“为公教团体或个人不得参加反动组织”的训令，其主要内容如下：
    查大战终结后，下列三团体，日见扩张，颇值吾人注意：
        （一）国际妇女民主协会
        （二）世界工会
        （三）世界青年民主协会
        （本报编者按：黎培里在这个反动“训令”
    中所列的三个团体的名称，实即国际民主妇女
    联合会、世界工会联合会、世界民主青年联盟
    的恶意的讹译。）
    该三团体之势力，逐渐增强，从其各项活动，颇可使人怀疑。罗马圣座根据可靠资料，切知该三团体所有主义系重演共产思想，犹如三组同性质之师旅，促使共产理论普及全球。因此，凡我公教团体，不得与以上组织，同流合污，并须避免袒护彼等之事业。”
    二、当南京解放后，他又以“教廷公使”名义，散发一九四九年七月一日“罗马圣职部命令”，其内容主要如下：
        “（一）参加共产党或对共产党表示热忱，是不合法的。共产党的领袖们虽倡言不反宗教，而事实上在理论方面或实际行动方面，显然表示他们对于上帝、真正宗教神教会是仇视的。
        （二）出版宣传或阅读载有共产党人的理论或行动的书籍杂志报章，或在那些刊物里撰写文章，是不合法，依法应当禁止的。
        （三）凡任意作过上两项事情的教徒，照通常原则，情性不正者，不得参与圣餐祭礼。
        （四）信仰共产党唯物主义反宗教理论的教徒们，尤其是那些为这种理论去辩护和宣传，作为天主教的信徒，无条件的要受到被教廷驱逐出教的特别处分。”
    三、黎培里又以“教廷公使”名义发出“罗马圣职部”的一九五○年七月二十八日“警告”内容如下：
        “谁都知道，在共产党的指示和赞助之下，成立了一些组织，这些组织以对青年男女们灌输唯物主义的理论制度和攻击基督教道德为其目的。
    因之，警告属于这类组织的基督教友们，不论在何种名目掩护之下，都将遭受一九四九年七月一日圣职部所发布的命令里面所举出的制裁。
        （一）父母或其代理人，违反C、一三七二号教规第二款上项圣职部命令之规定，自由加入上列之组织者，丧失其接受圣典之资格。
    （二）违反基督教道德及信仰而教育男女青年者，应遭受被逐出教之特别处分。
    （三）凡参加上类组织之任何男女，均丧失其取得圣典之资格。”
    黎培里在今年又重发了这一反动文件，并在这些文件上指明中国天主教只能听命于“梵蒂冈”和“教会长上”，这就是说，中国天主教徒只能听命于黎培里、马迪懦、雷震远一类间谍和于斌、许德一类汉奸，而不得服从中国的人民政府的法令。
    最近北京破获的间谍案中主犯之一马迪懦的供词中，也承认“曾把黎培里代表宗教上的指示，传达给华北各天主教会”，“这些指示，都是尽力制造八路军的恐怖政策，遇机会向教徒宣传，从旁污蔑八路军，坚决与人民为敌。”
    破坏各地爱国教徒的爱国活动
    在全国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，各地天主教徒，纷纷发起了参加抗美援朝、反对帝国主义操纵和利用中国天主教会的爱国运动。黎培里对这个运动极端敌视，不惜以各种卑鄙方式进行破坏。
    黎培里指使他直接指挥的天主教教务协进委员会
    （又名天主教中央局，原文是Catholic  CentralBnreau），在上海印发破坏政府威信，挑拨教徒与政府的关系以及污蔑中国教徒爱国运动的大批书刊，主要的如曾经各地报纸上所揭发的“学习参考”、“圣而公教会”等，并出版了外文的刊物
    “传教丛书”、“传教研究”等，在这些刊物上传布黎培里的反动命令和指示，欺骗蒙蔽教徒和威胁各地教徒的爱国运动。
    他又指使前天津教区主教文贵宾（Jean  DeVienne），起草一个“天主教中国全体主教的声明”，经他批准后散发各地主教。在这个文件中，企图借其宗教地位，胁迫各地主教签名，以达到破坏教徒爱国运动的目的。
    一九五○年至一九五一年间，黎培里曾两次签发关于教徒攻击有神权者的处罚命令，这个命令的目的，即是企图以“摘神权”和“开除教籍”的手段威胁爱国的主教、神甫和教徒，不许他们有支持人民政府的表示。
    又本年一月二十九日黎培里给兰州天主教德籍主教濮登博（Theodore  Orck  Buddenb）的指示说：
    “在一切表面的事情上，可让中国神甫以你的名义执行去，但实际上一切权力仍归于你。”
    从这里看出黎培里企图利用中国主教神甫作傀儡，而将实权紧抓在帝国主义分子手里绝不放松。但黎培里这种种阴谋，破坏不了天主教徒的爱国运动，连黎培里居留的南京市天主教徒也组织起来，发表了爱国的宣言。被此事激怒的黎培里，向全国各区主教发出一个通知，公然指中国爱国人民为“敌人”，企图煽动全体教徒和神职班对抗爱国教徒们的爱国运动，这个通知的内容如下：
    “今天，三月三十一日，南京报纸登载了一篇宣言，据说是由本大主教区的神长和教徒们签署的，我深为悲痛，并急速通知你，宣言制订时我未曾知悉，我也不能赞同此宣言。
    我竭力祈求圣神，给一切教友们，尤其给全体神职班，恩赐必要的明悟与勇气，去明白地洞悉和勇敢地战胜敌人的诡计，为了慈母圣教会和教宗的尊荣。”
    黎培里事后曾经解释他的这个通知说：“我特别不赞成的地方就是因为字句上包含着教宗干涉国家的内政和教徒反对本地教会的长上——于斌总主教。”
    上列这些具体事实，已无可辩驳地证明了黎培里彻头彻尾是一个披着宗教外衣的、对我新中国进行破坏活动的帝国主义分子，他的使命就是在中国组织间谍活动，并且胁迫中国天主教徒拥护美帝国主义和蒋介石而仇视人民政府，从而在实际上破坏中国人民政府。
