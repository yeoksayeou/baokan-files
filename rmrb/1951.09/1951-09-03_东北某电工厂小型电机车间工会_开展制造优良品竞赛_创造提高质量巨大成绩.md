    The trade union of the small motor workshop of a certain electrical factory in Northeast China led the launch of a competition for manufacturing excellent products. After more than six months of efforts, it finally created huge achievements in improving quality. For example, the pass rate of silicon steel sheets, the main component for assembling motors, has now reached 99%. The rate of second-rate products and waste products of other components has also been reduced from 20% to 70% in the past to 2%, or completely eliminated. As a result, the rework rate of assembled motors has also been reduced from 30% in the past to below 2%, and the electrical performance of finished products has reached 100% efficiency.
    The attainment of this achievement is mainly due to the trade union's cooperation with the administrative leadership to implement the following three methods for workers: (1) "Consulting machines," improving tools, and strengthening equipment maintenance. The poor product quality of the pressure group in the workshop was mainly due to the imprecision of the machines and die tools. The group organized a renovation and observation team, with the participation of technicians, foremen, and veteran workers, to conduct "machine consultations," studying improvement methods in detail. This made the precision of the tooth pitch on the indexing plate of the original press accurate, and the mechanical strength and clearance of the die met the specifications. This technical improvement enabled the group to produce a quality product first. This successful experience immediately dispelled the negative thoughts of some employees who believed that the factory's machinery and equipment were old and could not produce good work. As a result, all groups in the workshop attached importance to equipment maintenance, carrying out monthly inspections, which greatly improved equipment utilization. At the same time, the administrative management of the workshop also established and improved the mechanical responsibility system to consolidate the creative enthusiasm of the workers. The factory's technical security section inspected the workshop's important equipment once a month and repaired any problems in a timely manner. In this way, the workshop was guaranteed to completely eliminate machine accidents.
        (2) Learning the Guo Valiaofu work method to improve workers' technical level. Another important reason for the poor product quality in the workshop in the past was the inconsistency in the operating methods of workers in the same type of work, and the technical regulations were also imperfect. After the promotion of the Guo Valiaofu work method, the enthusiasm for learning technology in the entire workshop increased, and the method of summing up advanced experience by the workshop leaders also continued to improve. As a result, more than 20 new operating procedures have been developed successively. The leadership made most of these regulations into diagrams with additional explanations, making it easy for workers to accept and implement them. In this way, the technical proficiency of the workers was generally improved, and the phenomenon of violating operating procedures and affecting product quality in the past was greatly reduced.
        (3) Establish a strict inspection system, establish mass-based contact contracts, and implement the quality responsibility system. In this aspect, the workshop employees developed the experience of the Ma Hengchang team and created a "three-responsibility" inspection system. The content of this system is that whether it is the first inspection of the work, or the intermediate spot check, or the final inspection at the time of completion, the inspector, the production team leader, and the producer of the product are jointly responsible. If problems are found, the three will immediately hold a meeting to investigate the causes and formulate improvement measures. In this way, the shortcomings of inconsistencies between inspectors and producers are overcome, and the inspection system and quality responsibility system can be strictly implemented. However, the workshop is divided into three sections: tool, component, and assembly, and each section has many groups, which is a collective continuous production. Only the above system cannot completely guarantee good product quality. Therefore, the relevant groups and sections have signed contact contracts, making mutual guarantees and conducting mutual inspections. This more perfect collective inspection system guarantees that many products in the workshop can quickly break through the old quality standards. For example, the service life of the molds manufactured by the tool section of the workshop used to be 480,000 times, but now it has reached 1.2 million times, creating an unprecedented record.

    东北某电工厂小型电机车间工会
    开展制造优良品竞赛
    创造提高质量巨大成绩
    东北某电工厂小型电机车间工会领导开展制造优良品的竞赛，经过六个多月的努力，终于创造了提高质量的巨大成绩。例如装配电机用的主要部件钓钢片的合格率，现已达到百分之九十九，其他各种部件的次等品和废品也由过去百分之二十至七十降低到百分之二或全部消灭。因此，装配电机的返工率，也由过去的百分之三十降低到百分之二以下，制成品的电气性能达到了百分之百的效率。
    这一成就的获得，主要是由于工会配合行政领导工人实行了下面的三个办法：（一）“会诊机器”，改进工具，加强设备的检修工作。该车间压力组的产品质量不好，主要原因是机器和冲模工具不精密。该组便组织了一个整修观察小组，吸收技术人员、工长和老工人参加，进行“机器会诊”，详细地研究了改进的办法，使原来压力机拨齿盘上的齿距的精密度达到准确，冲模的机械强度和间隙也都合乎规格。这一技术上的改进，使该组首先做出了一台优良品。这个成功的经验，立刻打消了某些职工认为该厂机器设备陈旧、干不出好活的消极思想。于是车间各小组都对设备检修工作重视起来，按月进行检修，使设备利用率大为提高。同时，该车间行政管理方面也建立和健全了机械负责制度，以巩固职工的创造热情。工厂技术保安科每月检查一次车间的重要设备，发现毛病就及时修理。这样，便保证该车间完全消灭了机器事故。
        （二）学习郭瓦廖夫工作方法，提高了工人的技术水平。该车间过去产品质量不好的另一重要原因，是同一工种的工人的操作方法不统一，技术规程也不完善。推广郭瓦廖夫工作方法以后，全车间学习技术的热情提高，车间领导方面总结先进经验的方法也不断改进。因此，先后制订了二十多种新的操作规程。领导方面把这些规程大部制成图解，附加说明，使工人们容易接受和实行。这样，便普遍提高了工人的技术熟练程度，使过去违反操作规程影响产品质量的现象大为减少。
        （三）建立严格的检查制度，订立群众性的联系合同，贯彻执行质量责任制。在这一方面，该车间职工发展了马恒昌小组的经验，创造了“三责”检查制。这个制度的内容是：不论检查第一个活，或中间抽查，或完工时最后检查，都由检查员、生产小组长和该产品的生产者三个人共同负责。发现了问题，三人立即开会，追究原因，订出改进的办法。这样，就克服了检查员和生产者之间意见不一致的缺点，使检查制度和质量责任制度得以严格坚持执行。但是，该车间共分工具、部件、装配三个工段，各工段又有许多小组，是一种集体性的连续生产，只有上述制度，还不能完全保证产品质量良好。于是，有关小组和各工段之间又订立了联系合同，相互提出保证，相互进行检查。这种更完善的集体检查制度，就保证了该车间许多产品都能迅速地突破旧的质量标准。例如：该车间工具工段制造的冲模，过去的标准使用次数是四十八万次，现在已达到了一百二十万次，创造了空前的纪录。
