    In Ningbo Prefecture, Zhejiang, Some Cadres of Public Enterprises Resist the Trade Union Law; Relevant Authorities Should Thoroughly Inspect and Rectify

To the Editor:

    During the inspection of the implementation of the Trade Union Law in Ningbo Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, it was discovered that some leading cadres of public enterprises still have a certain degree of resistance to the implementation of the Trade Union Law. There are also serious problems in their attitude towards workers.

    Han Yuzhou, the administrative负责人 of the Renyuan Rice Mill in Zhenhai County, has consistently treated workers with a poor attitude. When the mill stopped production in May this year, Han Yuzhou asked the workers to leave the factory and go home, without paying severance or travel expenses. The trade union sent someone to negotiate this matter, but it was not resolved. The workers reported the matter to the Civil Affairs Section of the County People's Government, but it was still not resolved.

    When the mill was milling rice for the China Grain Company, the company required 70 jin of rice to be milled from every 100 jin of grain, but Han Yuzhou insisted that only 69 jin could be milled. The two parties agreed to try milling 20,000 jin first, and the result was that more than 71 jin of rice was milled from every 100 jin of grain. Han Yuzhou then colluded with a technician, attempting to embezzle the extra rice. When worker Chen Mingde discovered this, he reported it to the China Grain Company. The next day, Han Yuzhou fired Chen Mingde, saying:
    “You went to report, so I’ll fire you!”

    When cadres from the County Federation of Trade Unions went to work at the Renyuan Rice Mill, Han Yuzhou drove them out twice. The trade union dues that the mill should have paid have never been paid once.

    Similar incidents of violating the Trade Union Law or treating workers with rudeness also exist in some public enterprises in Yuyao. The Yuyao County branch of the China Grain Company hired porters for night work, but did not provide lights after the power went out, causing workers to slip and get injured at the river dock. The trade union demanded that the company be responsible for the medical treatment of the injured workers and requested that nighttime work be stopped, but the company did not accept the trade union's opinion.

    The manager of the Yuyao Department Store is dissatisfied with the Trade Union Law, saying, "I don't understand the Trade Union Law." He also stated at a forum: "Even the location of the trade union office is stipulated! We don't even have enough space to sleep, how can we find a house for the trade union? If inspected, every item will be unfulfilled!" Some leading cadres of public enterprises believe that "it is better not to establish trade unions in public enterprises" because "absorbing the chairman of the trade union to participate in administrative meetings will leak national economic secrets." They also asked: "Does the administration lead the trade union, or does the trade union lead the administration?" All of this shows that some cadres in local public enterprises are very confused in their thinking and have an incorrect attitude towards workers and trade unions, and it is urgent for relevant authorities to inspect and rectify this.

### 浙江宁波专区公营企业中  某些干部抗拒工会法  有关机关应切实检查纠正

    浙江宁波专区公营企业中
    某些干部抗拒工会法
    有关机关应切实检查纠正编辑同志：
    浙江省宁波专区在检查工会法的执行情况时，发现一部分公营企业的领导干部，对执行工会法还有一定程度的对抗。在对待工人的态度上也存在严重的问题。
    镇海县公营仁源米厂行政负责人韩玉周，一贯以恶劣态度对待工人。今年五月该厂停工，韩玉周要工人离厂回家，不发遣散费，也不发路费。工会派人去协商此事，没有解决。工人将此事告到县人民政府民政科去，结果也还是解决不了。
    该厂为中国粮食公司碾米时，公司要求每百斤谷碾七十斤米，韩玉周硬说只能碾六十九斤。双方约定先试碾二万斤，结果每百斤谷碾出米在七十一斤以上，韩玉周就和一个技工商议，企图将多出的米贪污。工人陈明德发觉此事，就到中国粮食公司去报告。第二天，韩玉周就把陈明德开除了。并说：
    “你去报告，我就开除你！”
    县总工会干部去仁源米厂工作时，曾被韩玉周赶出二次。该厂应缴纳之工会经费也从未缴过一次。
    类似的违反工会法或以蛮横态度对待工人的事情，在余姚某些公营企业中也是存在的。中国粮食公司余姚县公司雇来搬运工人做夜工，电厂停电后也不张灯，工人从河埠上滑下来受了伤。工会要求该公司给受伤工人负责医治，并要求停止黑夜工作，该公司不接受工会的意见。
    余姚百货公司经理不满意工会法，他说：“我不懂工会法。”并在一次座谈会上，曾表示：“连工会办公地点都规定了！我们连睡觉地方也不够，那能替工会找房子？如果检查，是条条未执行！”有些公营企业的领导干部，认为“在公营企业中以不建立工会为好”，理由是：“吸收工会主任参加行政会议，会泄漏国家经济秘密。”并提出：“到底是行政领导工会，还是工会领导行政？”这都说明了当地公营企业中的某些干部，在对待工人、工会，思想上是非常混乱的，态度是错误的，亟待有关机关检查、纠正。
