Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 20th: Since September 14th, the Korean People's Delegation to China has been holding successive report meetings here after returning home. The report meetings are held in an underground theater. Despite the continuous and frantic bombing and strafing of Pyongyang by American aircraft, the report meetings continue uninterrupted. Every day, more than a thousand people from all corners of Pyongyang rush to listen.

From the 14th to the 18th, the report was personally given by the head of the delegation, Won Tong-gun. He said: The delegation visited Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin and other places, and was warmly welcomed by the leaders of the Chinese People's Government, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life without exception. This is something that all members of the delegation will never forget. The delegation participated in a total of 20 welcome rallies and 92 symposiums in various cities, factories, and rural areas in China, with a total of more than 321,000 people from all walks of life in China participating in these gatherings. The art troupe that accompanied the delegation gave a total of 35 performances in various parts of China, with more than 200,000 viewers. The delegation visited the families and wounded soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers 32 times. Through these activities, the delegation expressed the Korean people's deep gratitude and condolences to the Chinese people.

In his report, Won Tong-gun described in detail the widespread and in-depth development of the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea throughout the country. He said: This movement has further enhanced the Chinese people's political consciousness and patriotism and internationalism, further strengthened the unity between the Chinese and Korean people, and made a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world. He said: The Chinese workers have put forward the slogan "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the weapon," and "One more drop of sweat in the rear, one less drop of blood for the brave soldiers on the front line," and are enthusiastically carrying out patriotic labor competitions. Farmers are launching production mutual aid movements. Cultural workers are engaged in depicting the just war of the Korean people and exposing the imperialist conspiracy of aggression. The industrial and commercial sectors are engaged in the exchange of materials. The religious circles are carrying out the Three-Self Reform Movement. The vast number of young men and women are asking to go to the Korean battlefield to participate in the war to resist U.S. aggression. The great Chinese people are thus highly displaying patriotism and internationalism. He said: The 475 million Chinese people, closely united under the banner of Mao Zedong, are supporting the Korean people with their inexhaustible strength. We can only repay the Chinese people by strengthening support for the front lines and striving for final victory.

The report of the Korean People's Delegation to China has been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Korea. Before and after each report meeting, groups of listeners often surround the representatives of the delegation, enthusiastically asking about the big and small things of the new China. After listening to Won Tong-gun's report, the workers in the Pyongyang area decided to use his report as a study material for in-depth study and discussion. The delegation will continue to hold report meetings and will go to the front and rear areas in groups to make roving reports to promote friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people.

    【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜人民访华代表团归国后，自九月十四日起连续在此间举行报告大会。报告会在某地下剧场举行。尽管美国飞机对平壤市区不断进行疯狂的轰炸扫射，报告会仍旧毫不间断地进行着。每天都有一千多人从平壤各个角落里赶往听讲。
    十四日至十八日，由代表团团长元东根亲自作报告。他说：代表团先后访问了北京、上海、南京、天津、沈阳、长春、哈尔滨等地，无例外地受到中国人民政府首长、各民主党派、人民团体和各界人民的热烈欢迎，这是代表团全体人员永远不会遗忘的。代表团在中国各城市、工厂、农村共参加了二十次欢迎大会和九十二次座谈会，参加这些集会的中国各界人民共达三十二万一千余人。与代表团同行的艺术团一共在中国各地演出了三十五次，观众达二十万人以上。代表团先后访问了中国人民志愿军家属和伤员三十二次。通过这些活动，代表团向中国人民表达了朝鲜人民对他们的深切感谢与慰问。
    元东根在报告中详细地介绍了中国人民抗美援朝运动在全国各地广泛而深入地展开的情况。他说：这一运动更加提高了中国人民的政治觉悟和爱国主义、国际主义精神，进一步加强了中朝两国人民的团结，对保卫远东及世界和平的事业作了伟大的贡献。他说：中国的工人们提出了“工厂即战场，机械即武器”，“后方多流一滴汗，前线勇士即少流一滴血”的口号，热烈地进行着爱国主义劳动竞赛。农民们展开生产互助运动。文化工作者从事于描写朝鲜人民的正义战争和揭露帝国主义侵略阴谋的工作。工商业界进行着交流物资的工作。宗教界进行着三自革新运动。广大的男女青年纷纷要求到朝鲜战场上来参加抗美战争。伟大的中国人民，就这样高度地发挥着爱国主义与国际主义精神。他说：紧密地团结在毛泽东旗帜下的四亿七千五百万中国人民，以他们的无穷无尽的力量支援着我们朝鲜人民。我们只有用加强支援前线、争取最后胜利的行动来报答中国人民。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团的报告受到朝鲜各界人民的热烈欢迎。在每次报告会开始前和结束后，经常有成群的听众包围着代表团的代表，热情地询问关于新中国的大小事情。平壤地区的工人在听了元东根的报告后，并决定把他的报告当作学习材料，深入地进行学习讨论。代表团将继续举行报告会，并将分组赴前、后方各地作巡回报告，以增进朝中人民的友谊和团结。
