    Resolutely Oppose the US's Separate Peace Treaty with Japan!
    Letter from the People of Daolingjian Village, Changping, to Foreign Minister Zhou
    The Chinese People Who Have Stood Up
    Have the Strength to Crush Any Enemy Conspiracy
    To Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, Zhou Enlai:
    The statement you issued on August 15th represents the will of the people nationwide. We resolutely support your statement and oppose the separate US-British peace treaty with Japan, and oppose the US arming Japan!
    From the "September 18th Incident" in 1931 to September 2, 1945, Japanese imperialism invaded China for a full fourteen years. The sacrifices and persecution suffered by the Chinese people under the ravages of the Japanese invaders are countless. In our village, Ying Chunhong's father – Ying Wanhe – was killed by the Japanese invaders in 1941. At that time, Chunhong was only nine years old, and he and his sixty-year-old grandmother, with everyone's help, barely managed to survive until now. Every time she thinks of Wanhe, Chunhong's grandmother always says to Chunhong: "Child, you must have ambition!" Chunhong says: "I have ambition. Under the leadership and education of Chairman Mao, I am already a member of the Communist Youth League; I am always ready to defend the motherland and avenge my father." Du Dechun's brother, Du Defu, was also killed by the Japanese devils. Du Dechun said: "Don't think I'm fifty years old, I can still work. Now I want to engage in production properly. This year I originally planned to increase production by 25 jin per mu, I will put in more effort to increase production by 30 jin per mu, and donate all the increased grain to buy airplanes and cannons to fight the American devils and consolidate national defense!" Two-thirds of the people in our village have been beaten by the Japanese devils, and the things stolen by the Japanese devils are incalculable. Our village is like this, so the losses of the whole of China are imaginable. When we saw the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan, we got very angry! The Chinese people put in the greatest effort in fighting the Japanese devils, and the people suffered the greatest losses. The US imperialism excludes us from the Allied powers against Japan, and all the people in our village are extremely resentful!
    Foreign Minister Zhou: Our lives are so much better now, if you compare it with the life six years ago (before Japan surrendered), it's a world of difference. The crops here are growing very well, and there are quite a few fruits on the fruit trees this year. This is all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The American bandits want to come and ruin our good times, we will never agree!
    Foreign Minister Zhou: We must take practical actions to support your statement. Everyone must guarantee the completion of the production increase plan. Ying Shikuang, Ying Shizhen, Li Wanshan, Du Lianfa, and Ying Wanfu have proposed to donate all the increased income to buy airplanes. Ying Wenchang, a fifty-eight-year-old family member of a serviceman, wants to write to his two sons in the army, telling them to work hard, defend the motherland, and consolidate national defense.
    Foreign Minister Zhou: Please warn the American imperialist robbers again: China is not the China of the past; it is a new China! The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war. The Chinese people who have stood up have the strength to crush any enemy conspiracy!

    Labor Model Gao Wanhong and Militia Hero Li Ming Express:
    The Chinese People Can Defeat the Japanese Devils
    And Can Also Crush the American Aggression Conspiracy
    On August 21st, a people's representative meeting of all circles was held in Yanqing County, Chahar. Gao Wanhong (female), an agricultural labor model representative who attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, and Li Ming, a militia hero who attended the National Combat Hero Representative Conference, also participated. When they heard the news that the United States was about to convene the San Francisco Conference to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, they gnashed their teeth and said: "What peace treaty! The United States just wants to arm Japan to invade China and invade Asia." After listening to Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on August 15th, they said: "That's right! It's illegal without the participation of our People's Republic of China. We must resolutely oppose this unreasonable act of US imperialism!" Gao Wanhong said: "Our old revolutionary base area suffered eight years of devastation by the Japanese devils. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we defeated the Japanese devils. Today, US imperialism wants to let the Japanese devils invade China again, we will never agree. We must resolutely do a good job in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and support the front line. We could defeat the Japanese devils in the past, and we will definitely be able to defeat US imperialism today!" Li Ming continued: "I killed more than 30 Japanese devils during the War of Resistance. Today, US imperialism says it is making peace with Japan, but in fact it is arming Japan. This can never be concealed from the Chinese people. I will resolutely lead the militia to do a good job in protecting the autumn harvest, continue to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and completely eliminate the American running dogs in China." Finally, both of them resolutely expressed that they would deeply publicize the resolutions of this representative meeting to the masses and ensure its implementation.
                        Lin Chen and Li Shizong, People's Navy Soldiers, Write:
    Taiwan, Penghu and Other Sacred Territories of China
    Will Never Allow US Imperialism to Occupy
    To the Editor:
    After reading Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement on August 15th, I am filled with hatred for the shameless actions of US and British imperialism. As is well known, the Chinese people, in the war to resist and defeat Japanese imperialism, went through a long and heroic struggle, made the greatest sacrifices, and contributed the most. However, US and British imperialism shamelessly and openly excluded the People's Republic of China from the Allied powers against Japan, which the Chinese people can never tolerate. This blatant violation of the United Nations Declaration, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Declaration and Proclamation, and the Far Eastern Commission's Resolution on Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan, and other important international agreements, which they participated in and signed, clearly exposes their treacherous and hideous faces. Peace-loving people can see clearly the conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism, and will use practical actions to shatter it. The Chinese people resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, oppose the separate US-British peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan. Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and the Nansha Islands are all territories of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people will never allow US imperialism to invade them. The aggressive actions of US imperialism will inevitably be severely struck by the great Chinese people!
    I am a People's Navy soldier. I will work and study harder, be more vigilant, do a good job in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, strengthen national defense, and fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands and other territories belonging to our country, and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world!

    Letter from Students' Summer Camp in Songjiang and Heilongjiang
    The Fourteen-Year Struggle of the People of Northeast China Against Japan
    Cannot Be Erased by Imperialists
    To the Editor:
    All students and cadres of our Songjiang and Heilongjiang Students' Summer Camp (participants include more than 700 students from universities and secondary schools in various counties and cities of Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces) resolutely support the solemn statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference.
    From 1931 to 1945, for fourteen years, our people in Northeast China lived a tragic life under the bloody rule of Japanese imperialism. For fourteen years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our people in Northeast China have been waging an unyielding struggle against Japanese imperialism; finally, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the elder brother, we achieved victory. We cannot forget the tragic life of the past fourteen years, we cannot let the blood shed in the fourteen years of arduous struggle flow in vain. We are closely watching the Japanese issue, and we resolutely oppose all the conspiracies of US imperialism to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan.
    Our people in Northeast China once lived a hellish life under the rule of Japanese imperialism. We ate "soybean cakes" and "acorn flour"; we wore "reborn cloth". Those sufferings are beyond our words. Today, we are liberated and living a happy and fulfilling life in the summer camp. US imperialism wants to arm Japan again, attempting to invade our great motherland and ruin our happy life. We, the people of Northeast China who have suffered fourteen years of pain, will never allow it.
    For fourteen years, the people of Northeast China have waged a desperate struggle against the Japanese invaders. Countless national heroes, such as Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, and Zhao Yiman, waged guerrilla warfare in the deep mountains of Northeast China, constantly attacking the enemy. Today, US and British imperialism are trying to exclude the People's Republic of China from the Allied powers against Japan, and attempting to erase the War of Resistance Against Japan, which the Chinese people carried out independently before 1941, from the history of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This shameless and barbaric act is intolerable to the Chinese people.
    To the Editor: We have endless words to describe our hatred for US imperialism. We must study hard, exercise our bodies, and strengthen the practical actions of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, in order to support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement and oppose US imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan.

    Letters from Employees of the Locomotive and Engineering Bureaus of the Ministry of Railways
    Implement Patriotic Pledges and Launch Labor Competitions
    Strengthen National Defense and Shatter American Aggression Conspiracies
    (I) To the Editor:
    All employees of our Locomotive General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways oppose the US imperialism's unauthorized drafting of a peace treaty with Japan and the convening of the so-called San Francisco Conference with extreme indignation. This arrogant and absurd action of US imperialism in tearing up international agreements, and its series of destructive acts in the Korean armistice negotiations, nakedly reflect its hostile attitude and aggressive ambitions towards the Chinese people and the people of the world. All comrades in our bureau resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn and just statement on behalf of the 475 million people of the People's Republic of China. We must strengthen all work to resist US aggression and aid Korea, further check, revise, and earnestly implement the patriotic pledges of individuals, groups, and the entire bureau, save locomotives and vehicles, and improve the quality of locomotives and vehicles, accelerate support for the front lines, and ensure the completion of our patriotic donation plan. Many veteran engineers have also resolutely stated: When the motherland needs it, they will go to the most difficult work posts on the front lines! In short, all of our comrades are determined to take practical actions to shatter the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism and strive for lasting world peace!
                             All Employees of the Locomotive General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways
    (II) To the Editor:
    China is the country that fought against Japanese imperialism for the longest time, contributed the most, and sacrificed the most. US imperialism has violated international agreements, illegally excluded our People's Republic of China from the Allied powers against Japan, and shamelessly conspired to steal our territory. Such absurd and hostile measures against the Chinese people are absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.
    US imperialism has arbitrarily drafted and announced a one-sided draft peace treaty with Japan, and convened the San Francisco Conference on September 4 in an attempt to sign a one-sided peace treaty with Japan, rearm Japan, expand the war of aggression, and destroy peace in the Far East and the world. All employees of the Engineering General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways resolutely oppose this shameless conspiracy of US imperialism and have decided to support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement on August 15 regarding the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference by deeply engaging in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, launching patriotic labor competitions, and completing railway construction tasks. The people of China and the Soviet Union, the people of Asia, and the people of the world, unite together to jointly shatter the conspiracy of US imperialism to launch a war of aggression and strive for the realization of lasting world peace!

    Letter from Yang Faqi, Xinhui County, Guangdong
    Do a Good Job in Propaganda and Expose the Enemy's Conspiracy
    Let All the Chinese People Unite to Fight
    To the Editor:
    Foreign Minister Zhou issued a statement on August 15 regarding the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference. This statement represents the opinions of all the Chinese people and is supported by all the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people carried out a long and arduous struggle against Japanese imperialism, and finally achieved a great victory with the help of the Soviet Red Army. Now US and British imperialism want to come and swallow the fruits of victory and conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. We resolutely oppose this barbaric behavior. The Chinese people sacrificed a lot in the war against Japan. The atrocities and crimes of Japanese imperialism in China are truly countless. Taking Du Ruan Township in our county as an example, more than half of the houses burned down by Japanese imperialism, hundreds of people were killed, and even more agricultural implements were looted and destroyed. We cannot forget this blood debt. Now US imperialism is coming to rearm Japan. This illegal activity is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.
    I guarantee to do my job well and carry out in-depth propaganda among the masses against US imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan. In addition, I also suggest that the leading organs in various places vigorously carry out propaganda against US aggression and aid Korea, against US imperialism's rearming of Japan, and against the separate peace treaty with Japan, so that every Chinese person can clearly understand this issue and take practical actions to oppose the shameless conspiracy of US imperialism.

    Medical Staff of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Work Conscientiously and Responsibly
    To the Editor:
    The staff of the clinic of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China are conscientious and responsible in their work and deserve praise.
    The hospital is not large and has four doctors. The doctors' attitude towards patients and their spirit of conscientiousness and responsibility are very good. In addition to checking the wards every day, they also often talk to patients to understand their situation and listen to their opinions. The nurses are kind and considerate to the patients. When patients are in a bad mood, the nurses can patiently persuade them. For example, Comrade Lin Jihai of the Transportation Section of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China was in a bad mood because he had been sick many times and was worried about the busy work in the office. Nurse Tian Zhi explained to him: "Don't worry, just take a good rest. The leadership decided to send you here to recuperate, this is your task. You must complete this task well and thoroughly recover from your illness, so as not to fail the leadership's concern for you."
    In early August, patient Chen Huiying needed a blood transfusion. Dr. Wang Ronghe of the Department of Internal Medicine and Zhang Zhiliang of the pharmacy had the same blood type as the patient, so they automatically gave Chen Huiying a blood transfusion of 200 cc. This action demonstrated a high degree of class friendship.
    In order to do their work better, they often pay attention to soliciting patients' opinions on medical care, nursing, food, and other aspects, and have forms available for patients to leave comments when they are discharged. Their work attitude and spirit demonstrate the excellent qualities of people's medical workers.

    Tax Bureau of Fuan County, Fujian
    Correct the Phenomenon of Tax Evasion by Local Public Enterprises
    To the Editor:
    The phenomenon of public enterprises in Fuan County, Fujian Province failing to affix stamp tax tickets is very serious. In March of this year, the Fuan County Tax Bureau conducted an inspection of the affixing of stamp tax tickets by public enterprises in Fuan, and at that time it was found that public enterprises such as the Fuan County Trading Company, Electric Factory, People's Bank, Telecommunications Bureau, and Xinhua Bookstore had failed to affix stamp tax tickets. After the Fuan County Tax Bureau dealt with this separately, the tax-evading units also publicly apologized in the Fujian Daily.
    In June of this year, the Fuan County Tax Bureau conducted a second inspection of the affixing and payment of stamp tax by public enterprises in Fuan County. This time, the inspection revealed 497 tax-evading vouchers (including account books, documents, remittance books, checkbooks, etc.) in units such as the Fuan Electric Factory, Telecommunications Bureau, Post Office, Trading Company, Tea Company, Central Health Hospital, Xinhua Bookstore, Insurance Company, and Fumin Factory, with a total of more than 2.8 million yuan in tax evasion. The Fuan County Tax Bureau believes that the above-mentioned tax evasion situation is very serious. In addition to imposing penalties in accordance with regulations, they also invited the responsible comrades of the tax-evading units to hold a symposium, requesting the heads of the enterprise units to strengthen the supervision and inspection of tax payment. The attending units all made self-criticisms and expressed their sincere acceptance of the punishment.

    Plain Province Postal Administration
    Should Attach Importance to National Taxation
    To the Editor:
    The Plain Province Postal Administration demonstrated its insufficient attention to national taxation in handling the issue of the Jun County Postal Bureau's failure to affix stamp tax.
    From July 1950 to July of this year, the Jun County Postal Bureau in Plain Province failed to affix stamps to business documents for newspaper distribution and seven account books, totaling 162,458 yuan in tax evasion. With the approval of the Plain Province Tax Bureau, a penalty of ten times the tax evaded was imposed in accordance with regulations, totaling 1,624,580 yuan.
    After the Jun County Postal Bureau reported this matter to the Plain Province Postal Administration, the Provincial Postal Administration did not criticize it in any way and stated that this "tax evasion was not intentional, but was caused by a low level of education and the serious existence of a guerrilla work style." We believe that tax evasion by public enterprises is a concrete manifestation of neglecting political study, neglecting state laws, or a sense of privilege. It is not right for the Plain Province Postal Administration to be so dismissive of this matter, and even think that it is a problem of "cultural level."

    坚决反对美国单独对日媾和！
    昌平悼陵监村人民给周外长写信
    站立起来了的中国人民
    有力量粉碎敌人任何阴谋中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长：
    你在八月十五日发表的声明，代表了全国人民的意志。我们坚决拥护你的声明，反对美英单独对日媾和，反对美国武装日本！
    从一九三一年“九一八”到一九四五年九月二日，日本帝国主义侵略中国整整十四年。中国人民在日寇蹂躏下遭受的牺牲和迫害是数不清的。我们村里，应春洪他爹——应万和，就是在一九四一年被日寇杀死的。那时，春洪才九岁，他和六十岁的奶奶，在大家的帮助下，好容易熬到现在。每次想起万和，春洪的奶奶总是对春洪说：“孩子，你要长志气呀！”春洪说：“我有志气。在毛主席的领导教育下，我已经是个青年团员啦；我时刻准备着，保卫祖国，给我爹报仇。”杜德春的哥哥杜德富也是被日本鬼子打死的。杜德春说：“别看我五十岁啦，我还能干一干。现在我要好好生产。今年我原来计划每亩增产二十五斤，我再使点劲，要每亩增产三十斤，把增产的粮食全部捐献买飞机大炮，打美国鬼子，巩固国防！”我们村有三分之二的人都挨过日本鬼子的打，被日本鬼子抢去的东西就无法计算了。我们这个村是这样，全中国的损失那就可想而知了。我们一看到美英对日和约草案，就气大啦！我们中国人民打日本鬼子出的力量最大，人民受的损失也最大，美帝国主义把我们排除在对日作战盟国之外，我们全村的老百姓都愤恨极了！
    周外长：我们现在的生活可好了，要是拿六年前
    （日本投降前）的生活来比，真有天地的差别。我们这里庄稼长得很好，今年的果树挂果子也不少。这都是共产党毛主席的领导好。美国强盗们想来破坏我们的好光景，我们决不答应！
    周外长：我们要以实际行动来拥护你的声明。大家都要保证完成增产计划，应士宽、应士珍、李万山、杜连发、应万福并提出要把增产收入全部捐献买飞机。五十八岁的军属应文常要给他在部队里的两个儿子去信，叫他们好好工作，保卫祖国，巩固国防。
    周外长：请你再警告美帝国主义者强盗们：中国不是过去的那个中国啦；是新的中国啦！中国人民热爱和平，但是也不怕战争。站起来了的中国人民，有力量粉碎敌人任何阴谋！

    劳动模范高万红民兵英雄李明表示
    中国人民能打败日本鬼子
    也就能粉碎美国侵略阴谋
    八月二十一日，察哈尔延庆县召开各界人民代表会议。出席全国劳动模范代表会议的农业劳动模范代表高万红（女）和出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的民兵英雄李明也参加了。他们两人听到美国最近要召开旧金山会议，对日单独媾和的消息后，都咬牙切齿地说：“什么媾和呀！美国就是想武装日本，来侵略中国，侵略亚洲。”听了周外长八月十五日的声明后，他们说：“对！没有咱中华人民共和国参加，就不合法。咱要坚决反对美帝国主义这种不讲理的举动！”高万红说：“我们老根据地受过日本鬼子八年残害。我们在共产党领导下，把日本鬼子打败了。今天美帝国主义又想让日本鬼子来侵略中国，我们决不答应。我们要坚决做好抗美援朝工作，支援前线。我们过去能打败日本鬼子，今天也就一定能打败美帝国主义！”李明接着说：“抗战时候我打死过三十多名日本鬼子。今天美帝国主义说是对日本媾和，其实是武装日本。这决瞒不了我们中国人民。我坚决领导民兵作好护秋工作，继续镇压反革命，把在中国的美国狗腿子澈底消灭干净。”最后，他们两人都坚决表示要把这次代表会议的决议向群众深入宣传，并保证其实现。

    决不允许美帝国主义侵占编辑同志：
    读了周外长八月十五日的严正声明后，我对美英帝国主义的无耻行动，万分痛恨。如所周知，中国人民在抵抗和打败日本帝国主义的战争中，经过长期英勇的斗争，牺牲最大，贡献最多。而美英帝国主义竟无耻地公然排除中华人民共和国于对日作战盟国之外，这是中国人民决不能容忍的。美英帝国主义这种公然破坏它们参加并签了字的联合国宣言、开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦宣言及公告，及远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策决议等重要国际协议，这明显地暴露出它们背信弃义的狰狞面目。爱好和平的人民都看得清美帝国主义的阴谋诡计，并将用实际行动来粉碎它。中国人民坚决拥护周外长声明，反对美英帝国主义单独对日媾和和重新武装日本。台湾、澎湖列岛、西沙群岛和南威岛都是中华人民共和国的领土，中国人民绝不允许美帝国主义来侵犯。美帝国主义的侵略行为必将受到伟大的中国人民的痛击！
    我是一个人民海军战士。我要加倍努力地工作和学习，提高警惕，做好抗美援朝工作，加强国防，并为解放台湾、澎湖列岛等属于我国的领土，保卫亚洲及世界的和平而奋斗到底！

    松江黑龙江学生夏令营来信
    东北人民十四年对日斗争
    是帝国主义者抹煞不了的编辑同志：
    我们松江、黑龙江学生夏令营（参加者有松江、黑龙江两省各县、市大中学校学生七百余人）全体同学和干部，坚决拥护外交部周恩来部长关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的庄严声明。
    从一九三一年到一九四五年十四年来，我们东北人民在日本帝国主义的血腥统治下过着惨痛的生活。十四年来，我们东北人民在中国共产党领导下，对日本帝国主义进行着不屈的斗争；最后终于在苏联老大哥的援助下，得到了胜利。我们不能忘掉十四年来的惨痛生活，我们不能让在十四年艰苦斗争中所流的鲜血白流。我们密切地注视着日本问题，我们坚决反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和的一切阴谋。
    我们东北人民，曾在日本帝国主义的统治下，过着地狱生活。我们吃过“豆饼”和“橡子面”；我们穿过“更生布”。那些苦，我们说也说不尽。今天，我们解放了，在夏令营里过着愉快幸福的生活。美帝国主义又要武装日本，企图侵略我们伟大的祖国，破坏我们的幸福生活。我们受过十四年痛苦的东北人民是决不允许的。
    十四年来，东北人民对日寇进行了殊死的斗争。无数民族英雄，像杨靖宇、李兆麟、赵一曼等，在东北深山里打游击，经常打击敌人。今天，美英帝国主义，竟要把中华人民共和国排除在对日作战盟国之外，并且妄图把中国人民一九四一年以前独力进行的抗日战争，从抗日战争史上抹掉。这种无耻横蛮的行为，是中国人民不能容忍的。
    编辑同志：我们对美帝国主义的仇恨，千言万语说不完。我们要努力学习、锻炼身体、加强抗美援朝工作的实际行动，来拥护周外长的严正声明，反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和。

    加强国防粉碎美国侵略阴谋（一）编辑同志：
    我们铁道部机务总局全体职工以极端愤慨的心情，反对美帝国主义擅自拟定对日和约草案和召开所谓旧金山会议。美帝国主义这种撕毁国际协定的狂妄荒谬的举动，及其在朝鲜停战谈判中的一系列的破坏行为，露骨地反映了它对中国人民和全世界人民的敌视态度及侵略野心。我局全体同志坚决拥护周外长代表中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民的庄严的正义的声明。我们要加强一切抗美援朝工作，进一步检查、修订并认真执行个人、小组与全局的爱国公约，节约机车车辆及提高机车车辆的质量，加紧支援前线，并保证完成我们的爱国捐献计划。有很多老工程师还坚决表示：在祖国需要的时候，就到前线最艰苦的工作岗位上去！总之，我们全体同志都决心以实际行动来粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，争取世界持久和平！
                             铁道部机务总局全体职工（二）编辑同志：
    中国是对日本帝国主义作战时间最久、贡献最多、牺牲最大的国家。美帝国主义竟违背国际协定，非法排除我中华人民共和国于对日作战盟国之外，更无耻地阴谋窃取我国领土。这种荒谬绝伦，敌视中国人民的措施是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    美帝国主义擅自拟定、公布片面的对日和约草案，并于九月四日召集旧金山会议，企图签订片面对日和约，重新武装日本，扩大侵略战争，破坏远东及世界和平。我们铁道部工程总局全体职工，坚决反对美帝国主义这种无耻阴谋，决定用深入抗美援朝运动、展开爱国主义劳动竞赛，完成铁路建设任务的实际行动，拥护我外交部周恩来部长八月十五日关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的庄严声明。中苏两国人民、亚洲人民、以及全世界人民，团结起来，共同粉碎美帝国主义发动侵略战争的阴谋，为实现世界持久和平而奋斗！

    做好宣传工作揭穿敌人阴谋
    让全中国人民一致起来斗争编辑同志：
    周外长在八月十五日发表了关于美英对和日约草案及旧金山会议的声明。这一声明，代表了全中国人民的意见，是全中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民所拥护的。中国人民，在共产党毛主席英明领导下，对日本帝国主义进行了长期艰苦的斗争，最后终于在苏联红军的帮助下，得到了伟大的胜利。现在美英帝国主义想来侵吞胜利果实，单独对日媾和，我们坚决反对这种蛮横行为。中国人民在对日战争中牺牲很大。日本帝国主义在中国的暴行和罪恶真是数不尽。单就我县杜阮乡来说，被日本帝国主义所烧毁的房屋，就占半数以上，被杀害的人民有数百人，被掠夺破坏的农具等更多。这笔血债，我们是不能忘掉的。现在美帝国主义又来重新武装日本，这种非法活动，是我们中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    我保证做好自己的工作，并向群众深入进行反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和的宣传。此外我还建议各地领导机关，大力进行抗美援朝、反对美帝国主义重新武装日本及单独对日媾和的宣传，使每一个中国人民都清楚认识这个问题，并以实际行动来反对美帝国主义的无耻阴谋。

    中共北京市委医务所
    医务人员工作认真负责编辑同志：
    中共北京市委医务所工作人员，工作认真负责，值得表扬。
    该院规模不大，有医生四人。医生们对病人的态度和认真负责的精神都非常好。他们除每天查病房外，还时常和病人谈话，了解病人情况，听取病人意见。护士对病人态度和蔼，照顾周到。病人情绪不好时，护士能耐心劝说。如中共北京市委机关交通股林继海同志因为屡次犯病，又惦念机关里工作忙，所以情绪不好。护士田致同志就向他解释说：“你不要着急，好好休养。上级决定你到这里来养病，这是你的一个任务。你要很好地完成这个任务，把病彻底养好，才不辜负上级对你的关心。”
    八月上旬，病人陈慧英需要输血，该院内科大夫王荣和和药房张志良两同志血型与病人血型一样，就自动给陈慧英输血二百西西。这种行动表现了高度阶级友爱。
    他们为了把工作做得更好，经常注意征求病人对医疗、护理、伙食等各方面的意见，并备有表格，让病人出院的时候留意见。他们这种的工作态度和精神，表现了人民医务工作者的优良品质。

    纠正当地公营企业漏税现象编辑同志：
    福建省福安县公营企业单位漏贴印花税票的现象很严重。福安县税务局在今年三月，曾对福安各公营企业贴印花税票的情况作了一次检查，当时曾发现福安县贸易公司、电工厂、人民银行、电讯局、新华书店等公营企业单位有漏贴印花税票的情况。对此，福安县税局分别处理后，漏税单位也曾公开在福建日报上作了检讨。
    今年六月间，福安县税务局对福安县各公营企业单位进行了第二次的贴纳印花税的检查，这次检查结果，在福安电工厂、电信局、邮政局、贸易公司、茶业公司、中心卫生医院、新华书店、保险公司、福民工厂等单位查出四百九十七件漏税凭证（包括账簿、单据、送金簿、支票簿等），漏税共达二百八十多万元。福安县税务局认为上述漏税情况非常严重，除了按章给予处罚外，并约请各漏税单位的负责同志举行了座谈会，提出请各企业单位负责人加强纳税的督促检查，出席单位都作了检讨，表示诚恳接受处罚。

    应重视国家税收编辑同志：
    平原省邮政管理局在处理浚县邮政局漏贴印花税的问题上，表现了他们对国家税收的不够重视。
    平原省浚县邮政局，自一九五零年七月到今年七月，发行报纸的营业单据及七本账簿漏贴印花，两项共漏税十六万二千四百五十八元，经平原省税务局批准，按章给予十倍处罚，计罚款一百六十二万四千五百八十元。
    浚县邮政局将此事报告给平原省邮政管理局以后，省邮政管理局对此竟未加任何批评，并表示这次“漏税并非有意识，而是文化程度低，游击作风严重存在”所致。我们认为公营企业单位漏税，是轻视政治学习，轻视国家法令，或是一种特权思想的具体表现，平原省邮政管理局如此轻视这件事情，甚至认为这是“文化水平”问题，这是不对的。
