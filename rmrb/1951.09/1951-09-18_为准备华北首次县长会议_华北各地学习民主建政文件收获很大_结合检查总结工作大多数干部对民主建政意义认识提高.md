To prepare for the first County Magistrate Conference in North China, governments at all levels in North China carried out the study of democratic governance documents and People's Daily editorials on the subject, and inspected and summarized the work of the People's Representative Conferences. Through this study, the ideological understanding of cadres has been significantly improved. As of now, the People's Governments of North China's provinces and the vast majority of special districts and county governments have inspected and summarized democratic governance work.

The provincial, special district, city, and county people's governments attached great importance to this study. Generally, the director of the provincial government's general office, the commissioner, the mayor, or the county magistrate was personally responsible, organizing cadres above the section chief level (including staff members in some counties and cities) to study for one to two and a half hours daily, or for a concentrated period of time. Tangshan and Handan Special Districts, as well as Jian’guo, Qingxian, Cheng’an, and Wucheng counties in Hebei Province, conducted special study tests. To ensure that the work inspection and summary were more in line with the actual situation, some counties also conducted in-depth interviews with representatives and the masses, or held discussion meetings after studying the governance documents, in order to understand and collect the representatives' and the masses' reflections and opinions on the People's Representative Conferences. For example, Shulu and Qingyuan counties in Hebei Province held representative symposiums respectively; Taigu County in Shanxi Province had the section chiefs of each section take responsibility for going deep into the representatives and masses in the cultural, educational, and industrial and commercial circles to listen to their opinions and collect materials; Pingding County held symposiums for different strata such as peasant representatives and specially invited representatives. In the process of study, the general approach was to first understand the spirit of the documents in light of one's own ideological understanding, and then use it as a basis for inspecting and summarizing the work of the People's Representative Conferences.

Judging from the inspection and summary reports of governments at all levels, this study has yielded great results, and generally improved the cadres' understanding of the People's Representative Conferences, and criticized many incorrect views in the past. First and foremost, many cadres have further realized that the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress are organs through which the people exercise state power, and are the basic system of our country, changing the one-sided and incorrect ideas such as "the representative conference is not as good as the cadre conference," "it is too troublesome to hold the representative conference," and "the representative conference is a good way to publicize policies and complete central tasks." Most counties and cities have stated in their inspection and summary that in the past, because cadres rarely studied democratic governance documents, they did not understand the nature and significance of the People's Representative Conferences. Although the People's Representative Conferences had achieved great results, promoted the spirit of people's democracy, implemented the government's policies and decrees, and effectively solved many major problems related to the production and life of the masses, thereby further strengthening the ties between the government and the people, and the People's Representative Conferences enjoyed a high reputation among the masses; however, it is undeniable that there were still some shortcomings in the People's Representative Conferences, the most important of which were that the People's Representative Conference had become an ordinary cadre conference, the handling of proposals was not serious and responsible enough, and the Standing Committee had failed to play its full role. These shortcomings hinder the further improvement of the People's Representative Conferences. After this study, the leading cadres of the provinces and many special districts and city and county people's governments realized that the work of political power construction itself is a problem of mobilizing and educating cadres and the masses. Therefore, in the future, whether before or during the People's Representative Conference, we must extensively conduct patriotic education and democratic education for cadres and the masses, and constantly improve the political consciousness of cadres and the masses. In this way, cadres will understand the great role of political power work, regard the people's representatives and the masses as masters of the country, and earnestly hold the People's Representative Conferences well, so as to unite the broad masses of people and jointly do a good job in the country's various construction tasks; and the people also know that it is their right and obligation to exercise state power, and actively rise up to demand to manage state affairs, so that the People's Representative Conferences can be held even better. Secondly, many cadres have realized the correct relationship between political power work and economic construction. Most of the special districts and cities and counties mentioned in the inspection and summary that some cadres had the idea of "burying their heads in construction without asking about politics," or felt that "good production means good politics." They opposed the construction of political power to economic construction, and therefore did not pay attention to the People's Representative Conferences, feeling that it was a lot of effort to hold the People's Representative Conferences and the effect was small; or they believed that the People's Representative Conferences were not as simple and straightforward as the cadre conferences; and when holding the People's Representative Conferences, they simply arranged work for the representatives, ignoring the display of the spirit of democracy and political education for the representatives. After this study, everyone realized that it is right to do a good job in production and construction, but it must be clearly recognized that without the New Democratic politics, there would be no New Democratic economy, and today's political power construction work is an important tool for guaranteeing and developing economic construction. Thirdly, some areas have criticized the idea of bourgeois formal democracy. Everyone realized that the New Democratic people's democracy must have a certain form, because a certain form can guarantee the display of the spirit of democracy, but more important is the essence of democracy. That is to say, in our country's current situation, we should adopt methods and ways suitable for the masses of the people to elect figures who can truly represent all democratic strata; and when convening the People's Representative Conference, we can fully demonstrate the spirit of democratic consultation and jointly do a good job in the country's construction work and solve major problems related to the production and life of the masses. Ding County, Cang County Special District, and Xinle and other counties in Hebei Province have conscientiously reviewed the mistakes of emphasizing universal suffrage and voting, and exposed many deviations and shortcomings of universal suffrage.

In short, through this study and inspection, most of the cadres of the People's Governments at all levels in North China have realized the important significance of ideological construction in political power work, and understand that the main reason why some People's Representative Conferences in the past were not well held was that cadres did not pay enough attention to the construction of political power ideologically, and there were some deviations. The leading cadres of most special districts and city and county people's governments have personally summarized the successful experiences in the work of the People's Representative Conferences based on their past practical work experience and the insights gained from this study, and many units have sincerely reviewed the shortcomings in their work and ideological errors. At present, there are still a very few special districts and counties that do not pay enough attention to this study and work inspection, pushing it to the civil affairs department, and the work inspection and summary is not serious enough, and the work inspection and summary is generally done.

    为准备华北首次县长会议
    华北各地学习民主建政文件收获很大
    结合检查总结工作大多数干部对民主建政意义认识提高
    为准备华北首次县长会议，华北各级人民政府开展了民主建政文件和人民日报有关社论的学习，检查总结了人民代表会议的工作。通过这次学习干部的思想认识已有显著的提高。截至现在，华北各省人民政府和绝大多数专署、县人民政府已经检查总结民主建政工作。
    各省、专区、市和县人民政府对这次学习很重视，一般是由省人民政府办公厅、专员、市长或县长亲自负责，组织科长以上干部（部分县、市包括科员等在内）每日学习一小时到两小时半，或集中学习一段时间。河北省唐山、邯郸专署、建国、青县、成安和武城等县专门作了学习测验。有些县为使工作检查总结更符合实际情况，在学习建政文件后，还深入代表和群众中进行访问，或召开座谈会，以便了解和收集代表和群众对人民代表会议的反映和意见。如河北省的束鹿、清苑县就分别召开了代表座谈会；山西省太谷县由各科科长分别负责深入文教界、工商界等阶层的代表和群众中，听取他们的意见，收集材料；平定县则分别召开了农民代表和特邀代表等不同阶层的座谈会。在学习过程中，一般都是先联系自己的思想认识领会文件精神，然后据以检查总结人民代表会议工作。
    从各级人民政府的检查总结报告来看，这次学习有很大收获，普遍提高了干部对人民代表会议的认识，批判了过去许多不正确的看法。首先最主要的是许多干部进一步认识到，人民代表会议和人民代表大会是人民行使政权的机关，是我们国家的基本制度，转变了“代表会不如干部会”、“开代表会太麻烦”以及“代表会是宣传政策，完成中心工作的好方法”等片面的不正确的思想。大多数县、市在检查总结中都提出，过去由于干部很少学习民主建政文件，不了解人民代表会议的性质和意义，虽然人民代表会议已经获得很大成绩，发扬了人民民主精神，贯彻了政府的政策法令，有效地解决了许多有关群众生产和生活上的重大问题，因而进一步密切了政府与人民的联系，人民代表会议在群众中享有很高的威信；但不可否认人民代表会议同时也还存在着一些缺点，其中最主要的是把人民代表会议开成了普通干部会，对提案的处理不够认真负责，常务委员会未能充分发挥作用。这些缺点障碍着人民代表会议的进一步提高。经过这次学习后，各省、许多专区和市县人民政府的领导干部认识到，政权建设工作本身就是一个发动、教育干部和群众的问题。因此今后无论在召开人民代表会议以前或人民代表会议期间，都必须广泛向干部和群众进行爱国教育和民主教育，不断提高干部和群众的政治觉悟。这样干部就会懂得政权工作的伟大作用，以国家的主人翁来看待人民代表和群众，认真地开好人民代表会议，以便团结广大人民，共同做好国家的各项建设工作；而人民也知道行使国家权力是自己的权利和义务，积极地起来要求管理国家的事情，这样就可以使人民代表会议开得更好。其次是许多干部认识了政权工作和经济建设的正确关系。大多数的专署和县市检查总结中都提到，有些干部有“埋头建设不问政治”的思想，或者觉得“生产好就是政治好”。他们把政权建设和经济建设对立起来，因而不重视人民代表会议，觉得开人民代表会议费劲大，收效小；或者认为人民代表会议不如干部会干脆痛快；而在召开人民代表会议时，也是简单地向代表布置工作，忽略民主精神的发挥和对代表的政治教育。经过这次学习后，大家认识到，生产建设好是对的，但必须明确地认识到没有新民主主义的政治，就不会有新民主主义的经济，而今天的政权建设工作，则正是保障和发展经济建设的重要工具。第三是某些地区批判了资产阶级形式民主的思想。大家认识到新民主主义的人民民主必须有一定的形式，因为一定的形式能够保证民主精神的发挥，但是更重要的则在民主的实质上。这就是说在我国目前的情况下，应该采用适合于人民群众的方式方法，选出真正能够代表各民主阶层的人物；而在召开人民代表会议时，又能充分发挥民主协商的精神，共同做好国家的各项建设工作，解决有关群众生产和生活上的重大问题。河北省定县、沧县专署及新乐等县，都认真地检讨了强调普选和票选的错误，并揭露了许多普选的偏向和缺点。
    总之，通过这次学习和检查，华北各级人民政府的大多数干部，已经认识到，政权工作中思想建设的重要意义，懂得了过去有些人民代表会议所以没有开好，最主要的原因是干部思想上对政权建设重视不足，并存在着若干偏向。大多数专区和市县人民政府的领导干部，都根据过去实际工作中的体会和这次学习的心得，亲自总结了人民代表会议工作中的成功经验，有不少单位诚恳地检讨了工作中的缺点和思想上的错误。目前也还有极少数专署和县对此次学习和工作检查不够重视，把它推给民政部门去作，对于工作检查总结不够认真，检查总结工作一般化。
