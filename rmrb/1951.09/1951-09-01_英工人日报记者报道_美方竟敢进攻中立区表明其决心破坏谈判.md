Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker" in London, reported from Kaesong on the 30th: Today (the 30th), fighting broke out in the neutral zone.

	The South Korean army under the command of Ridgway dared to boldly violate the neutral zone agreement, carrying machine guns and charging to a place three miles from Kaesong, which fully demonstrates the U.S. determination to sabotage the negotiations before the San Francisco conference opens. The Korean and Chinese guards have stopped their attack. Two guards on the Korean-Chinese side were killed in action. This incident occurred after the previous night's incident of a plane dropping flares near the meeting site, disrupting the neutral zone. The continuous provocations by the U.S. side and the transfer of Nacos to San Francisco show that the U.S. side has written off these peace negotiations and is now trying to make Korea and China bear the responsibility for the breakdown of the negotiations. But this U.S. conspiracy will not succeed. Nacos was here to carry out the important task of concealing the U.S. conspiracy to sabotage the conference, blocking the mouths of the press, preventing them from reporting the U.S.'s unsavory demands, and the U.S. violations of the neutral zone, reversing black and white, and substituting falsehood for truth. His new mission is to deceive the U.S.'s uneasy vassals with fabricated facts, persuading them to accept the U.S. plan to rearm Japan, because the U.S. is threatening to continue and expand the Korean War.

    美方竟敢进攻中立区表明其决心破坏谈判
     【新华社三十一日讯】英国伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿三十日自开城报道：今天（三十日）中立区内爆发了战事。
    李奇微指挥下的南朝鲜军竟敢大胆破坏中立区的协议，携带机枪冲到距开城市三哩的地方，这充分表明了美国决心在旧金山会议开会以前破坏谈判。朝中警卫人员已遏止了他们的进攻。朝中方面有警卫人员两人阵亡。这件事发生在前一晚一架飞机在会址附近投掷照明弹的破坏中立区事件之后。美方不间断的挑衅行动和纳科斯被调去旧金山，表明了美方已经将这次和平谈判一笔勾消，现在正设法使朝中两国担负谈判破裂的责任。但是美方这个阴谋是不会成功的。纳科斯曾在此地担任重大任务，掩饰美国破坏会议的阴谋，堵住新闻界的嘴巴，使它们不能报道美国的见不得人的要求，以及美方违反中立区的事件，颠倒黑白，以假乱真。他现在的新任务是以美国的虚构的事实去哄骗美国那些惴惴不安的附庸国，劝诱它们接受美国重新武装日本的计划，因为美国威胁着要继续和扩大朝鲜战争。
