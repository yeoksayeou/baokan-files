    Article 3: The organization of people's procuratorates at all levels is as follows:
    (1) The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government may establish branches in major administrative regions or other regions. Each branch shall have a procurator-general and deputy procurator-general, under whom shall be a secretary-general, a general office, and divisions such as the First, Second, and Third Divisions. The general office shall have sections and offices; the divisions shall have inspection commissioners, procurators, assistant procurators, and clerks.
    (2) Provinces (administrative offices) and municipalities directly under the Central Government or major administrative regions shall establish people's procuratorates. Each procuratorate shall have a procurator-general and deputy procurator-general, under whom shall be an office and divisions such as the First and Second Divisions. The divisions shall have procurators, assistant procurators, and clerks.
    (3) Provincial people's procuratorates may establish branches in special districts. Each branch shall have a procurator-general and deputy procurator-general, under whom shall be procurators, assistant procurators, and clerks, and an office may be established.

However, larger city people's procuratorates may establish offices. Each division, office, and section of the procuratorates at all levels may, when necessary, appropriately establish deputy positions. In each ethnic autonomous region, a people's procuratorate equivalent to the people's government at that level shall be established according to its specific circumstances.
    Article 4: The procurator-general of the people's procuratorate at each level shall preside over the affairs of the entire procuratorate. The deputy procurator-general shall assist the procurator-general in performing his duties.
    Article 5: People's procuratorates at all levels may establish committees consisting of several members, with the procurator-general, deputy procurator-general, and committee members forming a committee meeting, with the procurator-general as the chairman. In the event of disagreement in the committee meeting, the decision shall be made by the procurator-general. The committee meetings of the people's procuratorates at all levels shall deliberate on policies and guidelines related to procuratorial work and other important matters. The committee meetings of the people's procuratorates at all levels shall be held once a month, convened by the procurator-general. If necessary, they may be convened earlier or postponed.
    Article 6: The relationships between people's procuratorates at all levels and higher and lower levels, as well as various organs at the same level, are as follows:
    (1) People's procuratorates at all levels are under the leadership of the people's procuratorate at the next higher level.
    (2) People's procuratorates at all levels (including branches of the Supreme People's Procuratorate) are components of the people's government at the same level and are simultaneously under the leadership of the people's government committee at the same level, maintaining close contact with judicial, public security, supervisory, and other relevant organs at the same level to carry out their work. Branches of provincial people's procuratorates are under the guidance of the commissioners of the special districts where they are located.
    (3) When exercising procuratorial power, people's procuratorates at all levels shall initiate public prosecutions in the people's court at the same level if they believe that criminal sanctions should be imposed. If they believe that administrative sanctions should be imposed, they shall transfer the matter to the people's supervisory committee at the same level for handling.
    (4) For the purpose of effectively completing their tasks, people's procuratorates at all levels may request relevant materials and documents from various organs.
    (5) In order to obtain cooperation in their work, the procurator-general (deputy procurator-general) of the people's procuratorate at each level may consult with judicial, public security, and supervisory organs at the same level to participate in their administrative and professional meetings, and may also invite the aforementioned organs to participate in the administrative and professional meetings of the people's procuratorate at that level.
    Article 7: These regulations shall come into force on the date of approval and promulgation by the Central People's Government Committee.
