    Self-criticism Regarding the Erroneous Publication of the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" Film Advertisement
    To the Editors of Changjiang Daily:
    The "Shangrao Concentration Camp" film advertisement published in the Changjiang Daily on July 5th contained the erroneous phrase "Giant Film of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries Film Festival," which is a serious political error. This advertisement copy was sent by the Central-South Art Theatre. The Publishing Department of the newspaper noticed this error during the review process and deleted the "Important Announcement from the Seventh Academy." However, regarding the erroneous phrase "Giant Film of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries Film Festival," they only verbally instructed the workers to remove it and did not re-examine it after the layout was revised, resulting in such a major error. This is due to our ideological laxity, weak sense of political responsibility, and a careless and sloppy work style. We sincerely accept the readers' criticism and will strengthen the advertising review system in the future to ensure that such errors do not occur again.

    To the Editors of Dagang Daily:
    The "Shangrao Concentration Camp" film advertisement published in our newspaper on July 5th referred to the film as a "Giant Film of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries Film Festival," which was incorrect. We discovered this on the day of publication and immediately informed the Central-South Art Theatre and the relevant Central-South Film Company that sent the advertisement of the seriousness of the error. The Central-South Art Theatre immediately sent a self-criticism, which we published prominently on the first page under the newspaper title. At the same time, we recognized that we also bear responsibility for this matter and therefore made a public self-criticism as well.
    We believed at the time that the main purpose of this self-criticism was to clarify the political impact caused by the error in the advertisement, and this was explained in considerable detail in the Central-South Art Theatre's self-criticism, so we did not provide further explanation. In the part of our self-criticism, we acknowledged that we "also bear political responsibility," but we did not further point out that advertisements, like news and articles, are also "propaganda" materials. Advertisements published in newspapers should also possess political and ideological content. Failing to review such advertisements before publishing them is a manifestation of political irresponsibility. Reader Sun Xingran's point in your newspaper that our self-criticism was not profound enough, as well as the editor's note added by your newspaper, are both correct, and we sincerely accept them.
    Since this error occurred, we have strengthened political leadership and the review system for the advertising department and have made necessary reorganizations.

### 长江日报出版部、大刚报办公室  关于错误地刊登“上饶集中营”影片广告的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    长江日报出版部、大刚报办公室
    关于错误地刊登“上饶集中营”影片广告的检讨
    长江日报出版部的检讨编辑同志：
    长江日报七月五日刊登的“上饶集中营”电影广告中，刊出了“镇压反革命影展巨片”的错误词句，这是一个严重的政治错误。此广告稿系中南艺术剧院发出，报社出版部在审稿时曾看出这个错误，并将“七院重要启事”删去。但对于“镇压反革命影展巨片”的错误词句，则仅口头告诉工人去掉，在样子改好后也没有再检查一遍，结果出现了这样重大的错误。这是由于我们思想上麻痹，政治责任心不强，工作上存着马虎粗率的作风所致。我们诚恳地接受读者的批评，今后决加强广告审查制度，保证不再发生此类错误。长江日报出版部
    大刚报办公室的检讨编辑同志：
    七月五日我报刊出的“上饶集中营”影片广告，称该片是“镇压反革命影展巨片”，这是错误的。我们在刊出的当天，即已发觉，并即将错误的严重性告知送刊该广告的中南艺术剧院和有关的中南影片公司。中南艺术剧院马上送来了检讨，我们并把它刊在第一版报名下最显著的地位。同时，我们认识到对这事我们也要负责，因此也一并作了公开检讨。
    我们当时认为该项检讨的主要目的，是澄清由于该广告的错误所引起的政治影响，而这一点在中南艺术剧院的检讨中已经说得相当详细，因此就没有作更多的说明。而在我们所检讨的部分，承认我们“在政治上也负有责任”，但没有进一步指出广告和新闻、文章一样，也是“宣传”材料之一，报上刊出的广告也应当具有政治思想性，对于这样的广告未经审查即予刊登，就是在政治上不负责任的表现。读者孙星燃在你报指出我们的检讨不够深刻，以及你报编者所加的按语，都是正确的，我们诚恳接受。
    在这次错误发生以后，我们即加强了对广告科的政治领导与审稿制度，并进行了必要的改组。
    大刚报办公室
