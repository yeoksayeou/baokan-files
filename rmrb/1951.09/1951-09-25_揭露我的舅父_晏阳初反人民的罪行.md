    Exposing My Uncle—
    Yan Yangchu's Anti-People Crimes
    To the Editor:
    Xiao Ma's "The True Face of 'Reformist' Yan Yangchu," published in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on September 3, has further deepened my understanding of the reactionary essence of my reactionary uncle, Yan Yangchu. Therefore, based on what I have seen and heard, I want to make a supplementary expose of Yan Yangchu and his "Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement" (hereinafter referred to as "Mass Education Association") and "Chinese-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction" (hereinafter referred to as "JCRR").
    Yan Yangchu has always used "mass education" as a guise to carry out cultural and economic aggression for American imperialism through the so-called "Mass Education Association" and "JCRR." In 1945, the "Mass Education Association" moved from Chengdu to Xiemachang, about fifty kilometers away from Chongqing city. Soon, it received an appropriation from the puppet Executive Yuan and built a "Rural Construction College." The college had an affiliated "Jinghui Elementary School," whose chairman was my reactionary aunt, Xu Yali. "Jinghui Elementary School" carried out comprador-like, slavish education for its students. For example, every time there was a weekly meeting or game, the students had to learn so-called American moral etiquette, etc. From this, we can see how insidious and vicious the methods of the "Mass Education Association" were. It spared no effort to poison adults with education, and it never let go of children!
    In 1948, with the support of 270 million yuan of "U.S. aid," the "JCRR" was announced. The chairman of the "JCRR" was Jiang Menglin, and the vice chairman was Yan Yangchu. The director of the "JCRR" Chongqing office was Chen Kaisi, a lackey of American imperialism cultivated by Yan Yangchu himself. In addition to exploiting farmers through "agricultural loans," the "JCRR" also carried out brutal plunder of city residents. For example, in 1949, the "JCRR" hoarded cotton yarn and gold in Chongqing on a large scale, causing drastic fluctuations in prices throughout the city. This is the true purpose of Yan Yangchu's attempt to "cure" China's "poverty"!
    On November 16, 1949, before the liberation of Chongqing, Yan Yangchu fled to the United States. After he arrived in the United States, he wrote a letter to Qu Junong, asking Qu Junong to "fight internally," while he himself would "fight externally." From this, it is clear that Yan Yangchu's essence as an enemy of the people has been fully revealed.

### 揭露我的舅父——晏阳初反人民的罪行

    揭露我的舅父——
    晏阳初反人民的罪行编辑同志：
    九月三日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载萧马的““改良主义者”晏阳初的真面目”，使我进一步认识到我的反动舅父晏阳初的反动本质。因此，我要根据我的所见所闻，对晏阳初及其“中华平民教育促进会”（以下简称“平教会”）、“中国农村复兴联合委员会”（以下简称“农复会”），作一补充的揭露。
    晏阳初一向是以“平民教育”作为外衣，通过所谓“平教会”、“农复会”，替美国帝国主义进行文化、经济的侵略的。一九四五年，“平教会”由成都迁至离重庆市区约五十公里的歇马场。不久，它就得到了伪行政院的拨款，修建了一所“乡村建设学院”。该院附属有一所“景慧小学”，其董事长就是我的反动的舅母许雅丽。“景慧小学”对学生进行买办的奴化教育。譬如，每逢周会或游戏时，学生们都必须学习所谓美国的道德礼节等。由此可见，“平教会”的手段是怎样地阴险毒辣，它不仅不遗余力地对成人施行毒化教育，就是对于儿童也决不放松！
    一九四八年，在二亿七千万元“美援”的支持下，“农复会”宣告成立。“农复会”的主任委员是蒋梦麟，副主任委员是晏阳初。“农复会”重庆区办事处的主任，是晏阳初一手培养起来的美帝国主义的奴才陈开泗。“农复会”除了利用“农贷”剥削农民外，也对市民进行残暴的掠夺。例如，一九四九年“农复会”就曾在重庆大肆囤积棉纱和黄金，引起了全市物价激烈的波动。这就是晏阳初所要“医治”中国“贫”病的真实目的！
    一九四九年十一月十六日重庆解放前夕，晏阳初逃往美国。他到美国后，并曾写信给瞿菊农，要瞿菊农“打内仗”，而称自己“打外仗”。由此观之，晏阳初的与人民为敌的本质，实已昭然若揭了。
