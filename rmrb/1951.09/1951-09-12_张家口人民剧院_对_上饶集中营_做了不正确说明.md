To the Editor:

    In the August film introduction (booklet) of the Zhangjiakou People's Theater, the content introducing "Shangrao Concentration Camp" contains phrases such as "once wanted to rape female prisoners" and "prisoners were all in shackles," which I believe are serious political errors. Because, in the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" film, those who were shackled and imprisoned by the Kuomintang reactionaries were not "prisoners," but patriotic people admired by the masses; and the "female prisoners" mentioned in the "explanation" were female heroes who never yielded under any threat from the enemy. Such film introductions by the Zhangjiakou People's Theater are not only unhelpful to the audience but also blur the audience's understanding. I hope that theaters and cinemas in various places will carefully write "explanations" and "introductions."

### 张家口人民剧院  对“上饶集中营”做了不正确说明

    张家口人民剧院
    对“上饶集中营”做了不正确说明编辑同志：
    张家口人民剧院八月份的影片介绍（小册子）中，介绍“上饶集中营”的内容时，其中有的词句如“曾经想强奸女犯”、“囚犯是一律带脚镣”等，我认为这是有严重政治错误的。因为，在“上饶集中营”影片中被国民党反动派带上脚镣、禁闭起来的，并不是“囚犯”，而是人民群众所敬仰的爱国志士；而“说明”中所说的“女犯”，更是在敌人的任何威胁下不屈服的女英雄。像张家口人民剧院这样的影片介绍，不但对观众没有什么好处，反而模糊了观众的认识。希望各地的影剧院认真地编写“说明”和“介绍”。
