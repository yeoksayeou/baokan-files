    Xuancheng Prefectural Cultural and Educational Department of Southern Anhui Province
    Does Not Inquire About Political Tendencies When Inspecting Primary School Teachers
    To the Editor:
    The Xuancheng Prefecture of Southern Anhui Province conducted a study of policies such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries at a summer seminar for primary school principals, teaching directors, and senior teachers from seven counties. During the study, it was discovered that most primary school teachers in the region generally had a tendency to be busy with affairs and not concerned with politics. It is understood that at least 60% of the teachers do not read the newspaper daily. One teacher at Xuancheng Chenxiang Complete Primary School did not read the newspaper for an entire semester. She said, "I'm busy teaching and grading papers all day, where do I find the time to read the newspaper?" In after-class discussions about the current situation, some teachers were completely ignorant of the development process of the current Korean armistice negotiations. The principal of Xuancheng County Private Minqiang Primary School said in a group discussion that he had never read newspaper editorials in the past, and some teachers said that they used to think that Chinese and history teachers should be concerned about politics, while arithmetic and natural science teachers could ignore politics. Therefore, it is impossible to correctly implement patriotic political and ideological education in primary school teaching.
    Through study, many teachers have awakened. An old teacher in Ningguo County said with emotion, "I have been teaching for more than ten years, and I have always believed that education has nothing to do with politics. This time, after participating in the study of policies such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I understood what class viewpoint is and realized that education should serve politics." Many teachers feel the need to study from scratch.
    The Xuancheng Prefectural Cultural and Educational Department has further studied how to change this situation. I think this situation may also exist in other regions, and it is worth arousing the vigilance of various places.

### 皖南宣城专署文教科  检查小学教师不问政治倾向

    皖南宣城专署文教科
    检查小学教师不问政治倾向编辑同志：
    皖南宣城专区在七个县的小学校长、教导主任及高级教师暑期研究会上，开展了镇压反革命等政策学习。在学习中，发现全区大部分小学教师普遍有着忙于事务、不问政治的倾向。据了解，至少有百分之六十以上的教师不按日看报纸。宣城城厢完全小学一位教师一学期没有看过报。她说：“一天上课、改卷子，那来功夫看报？”在课余对目前形势的讨论中，有的教师对目前朝鲜停战谈判的发展过程茫无所知。宣城县私立民强小学校长在小组讨论会上，说出自己过去从不看报纸社论，有的教师谈出他们过去认为国文、历史教员要关心政治，算术及自然教师可以不问政治。因此，在小学教学中，就不能正确地贯彻爱国主义政治思想教育。
    通过学习，很多教师都醒悟过来。宁国县一位老教师感慨地说：“我教了十多年书，一直认为教育与政治无关。这次参加了镇压反革命政策等学习，才明白什么叫阶级观点，才晓得教育应为政治服务。”很多教师都觉得有从头学习的必要。
    宣城专署文教科已进一步研究改变这种情况。我认为这种情况在其他地区可能也有，值得引起各地警惕。
