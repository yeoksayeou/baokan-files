Explanation of the Amendment to the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate" and the Draft "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels"
Li Liuru, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government

Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and各位委员:

Today, on behalf of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, I am making a report to the Central People's Government Committee on the explanation of the amendment to the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate" and the draft "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels."

At the beginning of the establishment of the Central People's Government, the organization of the Supreme People's Procuratorate began. In December 1949, the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (for Trial Implementation)" were approved by the Chairman for trial implementation. In order to implement these regulations, the Supreme People's Procuratorate actively strengthened its own institutions on the one hand, and established local people's procuratorial institutions on the other. During the establishment of these institutions, all localities universally requested the early promulgation of the "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels," clearly stipulating the organization, powers, leadership, and relationship with other relevant organs of people's procuratorates at all levels, so that the national procuratorial organs would have a unified law to abide by. In order to meet this need, the Supreme People's Procuratorate drafted the "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels" in November 1950, based on the experience of various localities. At the same time, because Article 2 of the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (for Trial Implementation)" stipulated that people's procuratorates at all levels throughout the country should independently exercise their powers, which was not entirely suitable for the current situation, it was revised and sent to relevant central organs for comments. After repeated discussions and revisions, it was submitted to the Political and Legal Group of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for revision on April 11 this and then to the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for review and revision on August 30. The above two draft laws are now submitted to the Central People's Government Committee for review and approval. I would like to briefly explain the following four points:

	一、关于人民检察署的组织

The Supreme People's Procuratorate is the highest procuratorial organ in the country. Of course, on the one hand, it directly exercises procuratorial power, and on the other hand, more importantly, it leads the lower-level people's procuratorates to exercise procuratorial power. In order to facilitate the guidance of local people's procuratorates in carrying out procuratorial work, it has established branches in major administrative regions. The branch is a superior organ representing the central leadership of the locality. Below the branch, provincial (administrative region, municipal) people's procuratorates are established in provinces, administrative regions, and municipalities directly under the central government and major administrative regions; provincial branches are established in special districts; and county or municipal people's procuratorates are established in counties and cities. After more than a year of exploration and efforts, people's procuratorial institutions at all levels throughout the country have gradually increased. As of July of this year, there are five branches in major administrative regions, fifty provincial (administrative region, municipal) people's procuratorates, fifty-one provincial branches in special districts, and three hundred and fifty-two county (municipal) people's procuratorates, totaling four hundred and fifty-eight procuratorates established nationwide. That is to say, people's procuratorates above the provincial level have been fully established except for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and provincial branches in special districts account for 24.4 percent of the total number, and county (municipal) people's procuratorates account for 16.1 percent. The county (municipal) level people's procuratorate is the grassroots organization of people's procuratorial work. Therefore, not only must provincial branches be established as soon as possible, but also county (municipal) people's procuratorates must be gradually and universally established, so that procuratorial work can be more widely and systematically penetrate the masses, rely on the masses, and protect the revolutionary fruits and all legitimate rights and interests of the people. At present, most county-level people's procuratorates have not been established, and those that have been established are mostly unsound and urgently need to be strengthened. Therefore, the establishment and strengthening of county-level people's procuratorates is the key to the further development of procuratorial work in the future. However, due to many practical difficulties at present, we can only establish them with emphasis in order to move forward steadily and gradually promote them. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the Supreme People's Procuratorate specifically stipulates in Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Organization Regulations: "The powers in items 2 and 3 of the preceding paragraph may be temporarily entrusted to the public security organs of the respective localities in areas where lower-level procuratorates have not yet been established." However, in order to ensure that it can correctly carry out procuratorial business under the guidance of the superior people's procuratorate, the latter part of the second paragraph stipulates: "However, when carrying out procuratorial business, it must be subject to the guidance of the superior procuratorate."

	二、关于人民检察署的任务
		与职权

The People's Procuratorate is a newly established organ at the time of the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and is one of the important weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship. It is completely different from the procuratorial system of capitalism and old China, and it is not entirely the same as the procuratorial system of socialist Soviet Union. In capitalist countries and the old China ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the task of the procuratorial organs was to consolidate the reactionary ruling regime, protect the interests of the reactionary ruling class minority, and oppress the broad masses of the people; our people's procuratorial organs, on the other hand, have the task of safeguarding the implementation of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the various laws, decrees, and policies of the People's Government, consolidating the people's revolutionary regime, and protecting the interests of the broad masses of the people.

Regarding the powers of the People's Procuratorate, Article 3 of the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate" and Article 2 of the "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels" have already listed six items, which I will not repeat one by one. Now I will only talk about the main points of the additions and revisions:

Within the powers of the people's procuratorates at all levels, in order to clarify the current tasks of the people's procuratorates, the provision for the examination of counter-revolutionary cases has been added in addition to the examination of general criminal cases, and the examination of counter-revolutionary cases has been placed above general criminal cases. This is because the Chinese People's Liberation War has only won a basic victory and has not yet finally ended, and the establishment of our national regime is still recent. The overthrown enemies are still trying their best to sabotage the people's regime and the people's democratic cause. Therefore, in terms of business, reporting counter-revolution is even more an important task at present.

Secondly, regarding the modification: the original provision that the People's Procuratorate "lodges protests against illegal judgments of the court" is now changed to "lodges protests against illegal or inappropriate judgments of the trial organs at all levels." The people's judicial organs should absolutely protect the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, whether it is a judgment or a ruling, the People's Procuratorate should lodge a protest against any illegality or inappropriateness. This is to further protect the interests of the state and the people, and it is also to further increase the responsibility of the judicial organs for judgment and the people's procuratorate for judicial supervision.

	三、关于各级人民检察署的
		领导问题

In the original "Provisional Organization Regulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (for Trial Implementation)," the principle of vertical leadership was adopted, but due to more than a year of trial implementation, there were some obstacles. Therefore, the amendment changed to dual leadership, and it is stipulated in the "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels" that the local people's procuratorates at all levels are under the leadership of the superior procuratorate, and at the same time, they are also part of the people's governments at all levels and are under the leadership of the people's government committees at the same level. The reason for making such a revision is that China used to be a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society with extremely unbalanced economic development, a wide disparity in conditions in various places, a vast territory, and inconvenient transportation. Moreover, the people's procuratorates and their branches at all levels are mostly unsound or have not yet been established. Therefore, for the time being, we can only authorize local people's governments to give play to their flexibility and initiative under the unified policy and guidelines of the central government. At the same time, the development process of our people's democratic regime is from the local to the central. Regarding some specific local issues, the local regime has strong leadership and more experience, and it is easy to guide and handle them. The people's procuratorates at all levels are newly established institutions with weak cadres and little experience, and they still need the local government organs to provide guidance and assistance nearby in accordance with the central government's guidelines and plans. Therefore, changing the vertical leadership to dual leadership at this time is in line with the current actual situation.

	四、关于人民检察署与其他
		有关机关的分工合作

The "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels" stipulates on the one hand the relationship between the local people's procuratorate and the superior people's procuratorate and the people's government committee at the same level, and on the other hand the relationship between the local people's procuratorate and the judicial, public security, supervisory, and other relevant organs at the same level. Because although these organs have different powers from the People's Procuratorate, their overall political tasks are the same: to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and to ensure the implementation of the Common Program and the decrees and orders of the Central People's Government. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain close contact with these organs in order to carry out work. Regarding their division of labor, the "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels" only follows the general principles of Articles 13 and 14 of the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate" and makes the provisions of Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Article 6. As for the specific methods of division of labor and cooperation, they will be gradually tried out in the future and demarcated in explicit terms.

The above four points are a brief explanation of the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate" and the "General Rules on the Organization of People's Procuratorates at All Levels." Please verify whether it is appropriate!

### 关于“最高人民检察署暂行组织条例”修正案和“各级地方人民检察署组织通则”草案的说明

    关于“最高人民检察署暂行组织条例”修正案和“各级地方人民检察署组织通则”草案的说明
    中央人民政府最高人民检察署副检察长  李六如主席、副主席、各位委员：
    我今天代表最高人民检察署向中央人民政府委员会作关于“最高人民检察署暂行组织条例”修正案和“各级地方人民检察署组织通则”草案说明的报告。
    中央人民政府成立之初，即开始组织最高人民检察署。一九四九年十二月“最高人民检察署试行组织条例”，经主席批暂准试行。最高人民检察署为试行这个条例，一方面积极地充实本身机构，一方面组设各地人民检察机构。在这建立机构的当中，各地普遍要求早日颁行“各级地方人民检察署组织通则”，明确规定各级人民检察署的组织、职权、领导及与其他有关机关的关系，俾全国检察机关，均有一致遵守的法则。最高人民检察署为适应这个需要，乃于一九五○年十一月间综合各地经验拟就“各级地方人民检察署组织通则”草案，同时因“最高人民检察署试行组织条例”第二条有全国各级检察署均独立行使职权的规定，不完全适合于目前情况，故将其加以修正，分送中央各有关机关征求意见，又经过反复讨论修改后，于本年四月十一日提经中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会政法组修正，复于八月三十日提经中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会审查修正。兹将上开两法案提请中央人民政府委员会审查批准，谨合并就下列四点略作说明：
            一、关于人民检察署的组织
    最高人民检察署为全国最高检察机关。固然一方面直接行使检察权，另一方面更重要的是领导下级人民检察署行使检察权。它为便于指导地方人民检察署进行检察工作，特在各大行政区设立分署。分署是代表中央领导地方的上级机关。分署之下，在省、行署、中央及大行政区直辖市设立省（行署、市）人民检察署；在专区设立省分署；在县及市设县或市人民检察署。经过一年多的摸索和努力，全国各级检察机构已逐渐增加，截至本年七月止，计有大行政区分署五个；省（行署、市）人民检察署五十个；专区省分署五十一个；县（市）人民检察署三百五十二个，合计全国已建立了四百五十八个检察署。即是说省以上人民检察署除内蒙古自治区外已全部建立，专区省分署已建立者占总数百分之二四·四，县市人民检察署已建立者占百分之一六·一。县（市）级人民检察署为人民检察的基层组织，因此不但省分署必须尽可能早日建立，县（市）人民检察署也必须逐渐地普遍建立起来，检察工作才可更广泛地系统地深入群众，依靠群众，保护人民的革命果实和一切合法权益。县级人民检察署目前多未设立，已设立的亦多不健全，急待加以充实，所以设立与充实县级人民检察署为今后检察业务进一步开展的关键。但由于目前事实上尚有许多困难，目前我们只能先有重点地设立，以期稳步前进，逐渐推广。最高人民检察署为补救目前这
    一缺点，特于暂行组织条例第三条第二项明定：“前项二、三两款之职权，在下级检察署尚未设立的地区，得暂委托各该地公安机关执行”。但为保证它能在上级人民检察署指导下，正确执行检察业务，复于第二项后段规定：“但其执行检察业务时，须受上级检察署的指导”。
        二、关于人民检察署的任务
                    与职权
    人民检察署是中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立时新建立的机关，是人民民主专政的重要武器之一。它既完全不同于资本主义及旧中国的检察制度，也还不完全相同于社会主义苏联的检察制度。在资本主义的国家和国民党反动派统治的旧中国的检察机关，是以巩固反动统治政权、保护反动统治阶级少数利益、压迫广大人民为任务的；我们的人民检察机关，则以保卫中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领和人民政府的各项法律、法令、政策之实施与巩固人民革命政权、保护广大人民利益为任务的。
    关于人民检察署的职权，“最高人民检察署暂行组织条例”第三条及“各级地方人民检察署组织通则”第二条已有六项的列举规定，我不再一一重述，现在只把增加和修改的要点说一说：
    在各级人民检察署的职权内，为明确人民检察署的当前任务，特于检察一般刑事案件以外，增加检察反革命案件的规定，并且把反革命案件规定在一般刑事案件的上面。这是因为中国人民的解放战争，还只获得了基本的胜利，尚未最后结束，我国全国政权的建立，也还为时不久，被推翻的敌人还在千方百计地破坏人民政权和人民民主事业，所以在业务上检举反革命更成为目前的重要工作。
    其次说到修改方面：原来规定人民检察署“对于法院之违法判决，提起抗议”，现把它改为“对各级审判机关之违法或不当裁判，提起抗诉”。人民司法机关对于国家利益和人民利益，均应绝对予以保护，故不论其为判决或裁定，凡有违法或不当之处，人民检察署均应提起抗诉。这是进一步保护国家和人民的利益，也就是进一步加重了司法机关裁判和人民检察署司法监督的责任。
            三、关于各级人民检察署的
                    领导问题
    在原来的“最高人民检察署试行组织条例”中是采取垂直领导的原则的，但因试行一年多的经验，有些窒碍难行之处。故修正案改为双重领导，并在
    “各级地方人民检察署组织通则”中规定：各级地方人民检察署受上级检察署的领导，同时又为各级人民政府的组成部分，受同级人民政府委员会的领导。所以作如此的修正，因为我国过去曾经是半封建半殖民地的社会，经济发展极不平衡，各地情况悬殊不一，地区辽阔，交通不便，而各级人民检察署及其分署，目前又多不健全或尚未建立，因此暂时还只能在中央统一的政策方针下，授权于地方人民政府，使其发挥机动性与积极性。同时我们人民民主政权的发展过程，是由地方而中央。关于当地的一些具体问题，地方政权领导强，经验多，易于指导处理；各级地方人民检察署是一个新设立的机构，干部弱，经验少，尚需当地政府机关根据中央的方针计划，就近予以指导和协助。故此时将垂直领导改为双重领导，是切合目前实际情况的。
            四、关于人民检察署与其他
                    有关机关的分工合作
    “各级地方人民检察署组织通则”一方面规定地方人民检察署与上级人民检察署及同级人民政府委员会的关系，一方面规定地方人民检察署与同级司法、公安、监察及其他有关机关的关系。因为这些机关与人民检察署职权，虽有不同，但它们总的政治任务，则同是巩固人民民主专政与保障共同纲领和中央人民政府政令、法令之实施。因此必须和这些机关密切联系，方可进行工作。关于它们的分工，“各级地方人民检察署组织通则”只仿照“最高人民检察署暂行组织条例”第十三条及第十四条概括的原则，而为第六条第二、三、四、五款的规定。至于具体的分工合作办法，尚待以后逐渐试行，另用明文来划分。
    以上四点，是关于“最高人民检察署暂行组织条例”及“各级地方人民检察署组织通则”的简略说明，是否有当，请予核示！
                                    一九五一年九月三日
