Brief Commentary on Economic Life

How much are 100 million catties of rice or 100 billion RMB actually worth?

Many cadres do not have a very clear concept of the units of measurement we commonly use for pricing, rice and RMB. They feel: how much is 100 million catties of rice or 100 billion RMB worth? They feel that spending tens of billions or hundreds of billions of yuan is nothing. The reason they have this idea, in addition to problems with their political thinking and work style, is that they only know about large numbers but in reality, they have no idea and are not very clear about the value of rice and RMB. To give everyone a clear concept of the numbers for rice and RMB, the General Office of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council calculated 100 million catties of rice or 100 billion RMB as follows:

One hundred million catties equals 50,000 metric tons. Loading 100 million catties of rice onto trains (assuming 30 metric tons per car) requires more than 1,600 cars; if loaded onto trucks (assuming 3 metric tons per truck), it requires more than 16,600 trucks; if carried by people (assuming 80 catties per person), it requires 1.25 million people. One hundred million catties of rice can feed 100 million people for one day, or more than 3.3 million people for one month, or 280,000 people for one year; it equals the annual output of 700,000 mu of land, equal to the annual agricultural income of 47,600 middle-peasant households (assuming five people per household, three mu of land per person).

One hundred million catties of rice is worth more than 100 billion RMB. Let's calculate based on 100 billion RMB: 5,000 yuan notes, a total of 20 million notes, weigh about 40,000 catties. Counting them, at a rate of 32,000 notes per day for one teller, would take one year and eight months to count; stacked flat, they would be more than 900 zhang high; joined end-to-end, they would be more than 200 li longer than the railway line from Shanhaiguan through Tianjin and Beijing to Guangzhou.

One hundred million catties of rice or 100 billion RMB is currently worth about 8 million silver dollars, equivalent to nearly 430,000 catties. These silver dollars stacked up would be 8,000 zhang high; converted into gold, it would be 100,000 taels, requiring two large trucks to transport. With 100 million catties of rice or 100 billion RMB, you can buy 66 fighter planes, or the complete equipment of 30,000 spindles, or 345,000 bolts of fine cloth.

Some units, when submitting regular or temporary additional budgets, casually ask for hundreds of billions; in construction project failures, damage to inventory, or losses caused in other aspects, they are also calculated in hundreds of billions or tens of billions of yuan; losing several billion yuan is considered no big deal. These comrades should seriously examine their irresponsible attitude towards state and people's property; they should be awakened by looking at the above calculation!

    经济生活简评
    一亿斤米或一千亿元人民币究竟有多少？
    许多干部对于我们习用的计价单位米和人民币的概念是不十分清楚的。他们觉得：一亿斤米或者是一千亿元人民币能值多少呢？花费几十亿元或几百亿元，在他们觉得算不了什么。所以有这样的想法，除了政治思想和工作作风上的问题以外，还有
    一个原因是他们只知要大数目其实却心中无数，对于米和人民币的价值弄不很清楚。为了使大家对于米和人民币的数字有一个明确的概念，政务院财政经济委员会办公厅把一亿斤米或一千亿元人民币这样来计算了一下：
    一亿斤等于五万公吨。一亿斤米装火车（以每一车皮装三十公吨计）要装一千六百多个车皮；如果装汽车（以每辆装三公吨计），要装一万六千六百多辆卡车；如果用人力来担（以每人挑八十斤计），需要一百二十五万个人。一亿斤米可供一亿人吃一天，或三百三十多万人吃一个月，或二十八万人吃一年；等于七十万亩土地一年的产量，等于四万七千六百户中农（以每户五口人、每人三亩地计算）一年的农业收入。
    一亿斤米值人民币一千亿元以上。就以一千亿元来计算吧，五千元一张的票子，共二千万张，约重四万斤。清点起来，以一个出纳员每天清点三万二千张计，得清点一年零八个多月；平垒起来有九百多丈高，一张一张顺长接起来，比从山海关经天津北京到广州的铁路线还长二百多里。
    一亿斤米或一千亿元人民币，目前约值银元八百万元，合将近四十三万斤，这些银元垒起来有八千丈高；折合黄金也有十万两，得用两辆大卡车载运。拿一亿斤米或一千亿人民币，可以买战斗机六十六架，或三万纱锭的全部装备，或三十四万五千匹细布。
    有些单位在提出经常的或临时追加的预算的时候，一开口动辄千百亿元；在建筑工程失败、库存物资损坏或其他各方面造成的损失中，也动辄以百亿、十亿元计；损失几亿元竟被认为不算怎么了不得的事。这些同志应该好好检查一下自己对国家人民财产不负责任的思想；看看上面计算的这一篇账目，也该惊醒了！
