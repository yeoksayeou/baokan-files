Serious Indiscriminate Logging and Waste of Timber by Certain Forest Industry Sub-bureaus in Songjiang Province

The Weihe Sub-bureau under the Songjiang Forest Industry Bureau of the Northeast Forest Industry General Bureau, and the Muleng, Chaihe, and Shihuanzhen Sub-bureaus under the Mudanjiang Forest Industry Bureau, are experiencing serious indiscriminate logging and waste of timber.

In March of this year, after the Weihe Sub-bureau accepted the task of felling 160,000 stanchions for flatbed railcars (generally made from treetop wood for immediate transport), it did not formulate a detailed plan, nor did it designate a forestry center to organize the felling. Instead, it contracted the task to local people and signed purchasing contracts with them (note: this practice is entirely illegal, because forests are owned by the state, and felling can only be organized under leadership and paid with wages, not through "purchasing contracts"), allowing the people to fell trees at will. During the felling, the "clear-cutting" method was mostly used, resulting in the injury of many young trees. Furthermore, 60,000 oak and birch stanchions were indiscriminately felled, damaging the forestry center. Similar situations occurred at the Muleng Sub-bureau's timber yard from July 18th to August 2nd this year during the felling of stanchions. The timber yard signed contracts with people from the Xuxiaopu Forestry Center, located outside the felling area, to purchase stanchions, without organization or leadership, allowing the people to indiscriminately fell more than 2,900 oak and birch stanchions. When the local forest ranger discovered this and tried to stop it, the timber yard director claimed that because the Forest Industry Bureau was felling timber, the local government had no right to interfere; the planning section chief of the sub-bureau even said, "Our bureau's timber yard has always purchased stanchions this way in the past." The Pingyangzhen workshop under the sub-bureau, in order to repair the road leading into the mountains, used young trees instead of waste wood and treetop wood, indiscriminately felling 160 cubic meters of young trees in the Ganfanpen forest area, about one-third of which were valuable species such as ash and amur cork trees. Similar phenomena of forest destruction and timber waste also occurred in the Chaihe and Shihuanzhen Sub-bureaus. The Chaihe Sub-bureau felled more than 300 cubic meters of oak near Dahuanggou for fuel, without utilizing the treetop wood. In November of last year, the Shihuanzhen Sub-bureau allowed people to fell trees for charcoal burning in the Jingbo Lake Si Ba Wai Zi area (which is also a water conservation protection forest area) in a closed-for-reforestation zone without approval from higher authorities. The area's potential for nurturing of young trees was eliminated by the logging. This was stopped only after local government cadres discovered it.

The aforementioned sub-bureaus' actions of indiscriminately logging and wasting timber are illegal. The Songjiang Provincial Forestry Administration has submitted a request to the Provincial Supervisory Committee for inspection and handling.

Northeast Forest Industry General Bureau's Chemical Industry Division Sells Timber to Private Merchants Under the Guise of Allocation

The Jingyu Wood Refinement Factory of the Chemical Industry Division of the Northeast Forest Industry General Bureau had 2,000 cubic meters of miscellaneous wood (oak, Chinese ash, Manchurian ash) in old stock. On April 16th of this year, the Management Section of the Chemical Industry Division of the Northeast Forest Industry General Bureau introduced and sold 1,500 cubic meters of this timber to Qi Dazhi, a private merchant in Tianjin, and notified the factory director with an official letter to sign a formal contract with the private merchant. Additionally, it enclosed three national timber allocation certificates, a draft of the contract, and a transportation permit No. 795 issued by the Northeast Forest Industry General Bureau for transportation into the interior. After the factory sold the timber to the private merchant, it borrowed the Class A seal (circular) of the Jilin Forest Industry Bureau and stamped "Public Inspection" and "Public Release." When transporting the timber, it did not obtain inspection and permission from the local government's forestry administration department. From May to the end of July, 880 cubic meters were transported from Longquanzhen, Jingyu County, to Chaoyangzhen Station, Huinan, preparing for transportation into the interior. According to the regulations on the use of timber seals in the Northeast region, national allocated timber with Class A seals is not allowed to be sold. However, the factory sold the timber to the private merchant for profit under the guise of allocating timber. Such illegal timber sales by the Chemical Industry Division of the Northeast Forest Industry General Bureau and its affiliated Jingyu Wood Refinement Factory are completely unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.

Liaodong Provincial Veterans Affairs Administration and Other Units Facilitate Indiscriminate Logging and Sell Timber to Private Merchants

The Liaodong Provincial Veterans Affairs Administration, for the construction of farmhouses in the "Veterans New Village," was approved by the Provincial Forestry Administration on March 26, 1951, to clear 2,500 cubic meters of old stock in the Liangshuihezi Forest Area, Liuhe County. However, before applying for approval, on January 12th, the administration ordered the No. 2 Veterans Farm in Liuhe County to uniformly fell standing dead trees and surveyed the Liangshuihezi Forest Area. When the local people heard that the farm was going to fell timber, they entered the mountains, occupied locations, and began felling. At the same time, due to the farm's lack of prior planning, the people indiscriminately felled more than 300 cubic meters of standing dead trees. After the Agriculture and Forestry Section of the Liuhe County People's Government discovered this, it was stopped. However, in mid-February, the farm directly signed a felling contract with the Liuhe County Wood and Tile Workers' Union, which was responsible for the felling and transportation. But in reality, the Wood and Tile Workers' Union subcontracted the work to local people. In May of this year, after inspection by the Agriculture and Forestry Section of the County People's Government, it was discovered that the timber felled by the people had exceeded the originally approved quantity by more than 900 cubic meters. At this time, the Wood and Tile Workers' Union, attempting to purchase for profit, did not fully comply with the farm's timber specifications and made some of the timber into 2.4-meter-long logs, which the farm could not use. At the same time, after the inspection by the Agriculture and Forestry Section of the County People's Government, the Veterans Farm emphasized that the construction was insufficient and retained 350 cubic meters from the excess of 900 cubic meters of timber. However, it was later learned that the farm did not use these 350 cubic meters of timber for building houses but sold them all to private merchants.

The Agriculture and Forestry Section of Liuhe County was also at fault in this matter. First of all, the Agriculture and Forestry Section did not promptly monitor and inspect the Veterans Farm's logging, which was one of the reasons that contributed to their large over-logging. Secondly, after the inspection discovered the excess of 900 cubic meters, it should have been confiscated in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Forest Management in the Northeast Region" and reported to the higher authorities for handling. However, the County Agriculture and Forestry Section sold the excess timber to private merchants in Shenyang in order to supplement the county's fiscal revenue. This practice is also completely illegal. (Liaodong Provincial Forestry Administration)

Yuanzhou Timber Sub-company of Jiangxi Province Grossly Over-fells and Purchases Timber

The Yuanzhou Timber Sub-company under the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Commerce, due to a lack of correct understanding of forestry, focusing solely on accumulating funds and local interests, has experienced a serious phenomenon of over-purchasing and forest destruction in the work of felling trees.

The Yuanzhou Timber Sub-company's planned purchase volume in the whole area this year is 57,500 liangma of fir and 23,750 liangma of miscellaneous wood; while the timber production quantity listed in the draft of Jiangxi Province's agricultural and forestry production plan for 1952 is only 15,625 liangma, which shows the severity of the destruction of the mountains and forests. The actual amount of felling by the timber sub-company far exceeds this plan. For example, the Yifeng office of the timber sub-company is a specific example. Yifeng County is a fir-producing area in Yuanzhou Prefecture. According to the survey and extrapolation of fir forests by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry last year, the maximum reasonable felling volume of fir in the county should not exceed 5,000 liangma per year. However, the felling plan figure of the Yifeng office of the Yuanzhou Timber Sub-company this year is 12,000 liangma, and the office is still preparing to over-fell in large quantities. For this reason, not only has the number of cadres been increased, but in addition to the original Huanggang and Tianbao timber factories, a Tangpu timber factory has also been added. The fact is that in Yifeng County, in July alone, 3,806 liangma were felled, exceeding the original felling plan for July by more than 90 percent. Seeing that the profit from purchasing timber is large, the county people's government has also invested in the timber company. Just looking at the situation in Yifeng County, it is not difficult to see the severity of the Yuanzhou Timber Sub-company's indiscriminate felling.

The Yuanzhou Timber Sub-company also has offices in Tonggu, Fenyi, Pingxiang, Yichun, Wanzai, and other counties (except for Tonggu, all were newly established this year). The felling work in these counties is similar to the situation in Yifeng, all far exceeding the reasonable felling volume. In particular, the fir forests in Yichun have been almost depleted to the point where there is nothing left to fell. However, the timber company is still collecting and purchasing everywhere.

The main reason why the Yuanzhou Timber Sub-company disregards long-term interests and national construction needs and carries out indiscriminate felling beyond the plan is that the timber company does not have enough understanding of the country's timber resources and has a confused idea of only caring about local interests. They only know that purchasing timber is a good way to "accumulate funds" and "solve financial difficulties," but they do not know the close relationship between forests and water and drought disasters, as well as between timber and industrial, mining, transportation construction. Therefore, from the beginning, they have made various preparations for "over-felling" and are carrying out unrestricted indiscriminate felling of the limited mountains and forests. (Lin Li)

    反对浪费木材，反对滥伐林木！
    松江省某些森林工业分局严重地滥伐山林浪费木材
    东北森林工业总局松江森林工业局所属苇河分局、牡丹江森林工业局所属穆棱、柴河、世环镇三分局存在着严重的滥伐山林、浪费木材的现象。
    苇河分局今年三月间接受采伐十六万根车立柱（按即运木材时，平板车四周所用的木柱子，一般是利用梢头木）的任务后，没有制订详细计划指定林场组织采伐，却把任务包给当地群众，与群众订立收买合同（按：这种作法完全是非法的，因为森林为国家所有，只能领导组织采伐，给以工资，而不应订“收买合同”），任群众上山随便砍伐。在采伐中，大部采用“剃光头”方式，结果很多幼树被碰伤，而且滥伐了柞、桦木车立柱六万根，使林场遭到破坏。穆棱分局贮木场今年七月十八日到八月二日，在采伐车立柱时也有类似情形。该贮木场与采伐区域以外的徐小铺林场的群众订立合同收买车立柱，也是无组织无领导，任群众滥伐柞、桦木车立柱二千九百余根。当地护林员发现后予以制止时，贮木场场长竟认为森林工业局采伐林木，当地政府无权干涉；该分局计划股长还说：“我局贮木场收买车立柱，过去也都是这样作的。”该分局平阳镇作业所为了修垫通往山里的大道，不用废材及梢头木，却在干饭盆林区滥伐幼树达一百六十立方公尺，其中约三分之一是水曲柳、黄波萝等珍贵树种。这种破坏森林、浪费木材的现象，柴河与世环镇分局也有。柴河分局在大荒沟附近采伐柞木三百余立方公尺，劈作燃料，梢头木也未利用。世环镇分局在去年十一月间，未经上级批准，就允许群众在封山育林地区镜泊湖四八崴子（该地又是水源涵养保安林区）采木烧炭，把可以抚育的幼树都砍伐了，经当地政府干部发现后才制止。
    上述各分局滥伐山林、浪费木材的行为是不合法的，松江省林政处已呈请省监察委员会检查处理。

    东北森林工业总局化工处借调拨名义卖木材给私商
    东北森林工业总局化工处靖宇木精工厂存放有两千立方公尺杂木（柞、楸、水曲柳）陈材，今年四月十六日，东北森林工业总局化工处经理科就把这批木材介绍出卖给天津私商戚大治一千五百立方公尺，并以公函通知该厂厂长与该私商订立正式合同，另外还附寄国家支拨木材调拨证三张，合同底稿一份，及由东北森林工业总局发给运往关内七九五号运输证一份。该厂把木材卖给私商后，又借用吉林森林工业局甲种号印（圆形）加盖“公检”、“公放”。在运输木材时，并未取得地方政府林政主管部门检查许可，从五月到七月底，就由靖宇县龙泉镇运到辉南朝阳镇车站八百八十立方公尺，准备运往关内。据东北区木材号印使用办法中规定，凡加盖甲种号印的国家调拨木材是不准出售的。而该厂竟以调拨木材为名，把木材卖给私商营利。东北森林工业总局化工处及该处属的靖宇木精工厂，这种违法出售木材的行为，是完全不能容许的，亟应予以制止。（辽东省林政处）
    辽东省荣军管理处等单位助长滥伐木材并卖给私商
    辽东省荣誉军人管理处为修建“荣誉新村”的农场屋宇，于一九五一年三月二十六日由省林政处批准在柳河县凉水河子林区清理陈材二千五百立方公尺。但该处在未申请批准前，于一月十二日即令柳河荣誉军人第二农场统一采伐站杆（即尚未采伐的已死树木），并往凉水河子林区勘查。当地群众听说农场要伐木材，即入山占好地点，开始砍伐。同时又由于该场事前并没有很好计划，使群众滥伐了站杆三百余立方公尺。经柳河县人民政府农林科发觉后，才加以制止。但在二月中旬该场又直接与柳河县木瓦工会订立采伐合同，由木瓦工会负责采伐搬运事宜。但实际上木瓦工会又分别转包给当地群众。今年五月份由县人民政府农林科检查后，发现群众砍伐的木材已较原批准的数量超过九百余立方公尺。这时木瓦工会因为企图收购营利，并未完全按照农场用材规格，就把一部分木材制成二点四公尺长的原木，结果农场不能用。同时，荣誉军人农场在县人民政府农林科检查后强调修建不足，又由超过的九百立方公尺木材中留下三百五十立方公尺。可是经后来了解，这三百五十立方公尺木材，农场并未用作修建屋宇，而是全部卖给私商了。
    在这个问题上，柳河县农林科也是有错误的。首先是农林科对荣誉军人农场伐木没有及时掌握检查，这也是助长了他们大量超额伐木的原因之一。其次是当检查后既已发现多出九百立方公尺，就应按“东北区森林管理暂行条例”规定，予以没收，并报请上级处理。然而该县农林科为了补助县财政收入，竟把超过的木材卖给沈阳私商。这种作法也完全是违法的。（辽东省林政处）
    江西省袁州木材分公司大量超额采伐购买木材
    江西省商业厅所属木材公司袁州分公司在采伐林木工作上，由于对林业没有正确认识，单纯为积累资金及局部利益打算，而发生了严重的超额采购、破坏森林的现象。
    袁州木材分公司今年计划在全区采购总量为杉木五万七千五百两码，杂木二万三千七百五十两码；而一九五二年江西省农林生产计划草案中所列该区木材生产数量却不过一万五千六百二十五两码，由此可见对山林破坏的严重。而该木材分公司的实际采伐量，则又远超过这个计划。例如该木材分公司宜丰办事处就是一个具体例子。宜丰县是袁州专区的杉木产区，根据去年江西省农林厅对杉林的调查推算，该县杉木每年合理采伐量最多不能超过五千两码，但袁州木材分公司宜丰办事处今年的采伐计划数字却是一万二千两码，而且该办事处仍准备大量超额采伐，为此不仅增加了干部，并除原有的黄岗、天宝两个木材厂外，又增设了一个棠浦木材厂。事实是：在宜丰仅七月份一个月就砍伐了三千八百零六两码，超过七月份原采伐计划二千两码的百分之九十强。由于看到采购木材利润大，该县人民政府也在木材公司投了资。单看宜丰一县的情况，就不难看出袁州木材分公司滥伐程度的严重了。
    袁州木材分公司在铜鼓、分宜、萍乡、宜春、万载等县也都设有办事处（除铜鼓外，都是今年新设的），这些县的采伐工作和宜丰的情形相似，都远超过了合理采伐量。特别是宜春的杉木林，早已所剩无几，到了采无可采的地步。但木材公司仍是到处搜集采购。
    袁州木材分公司之所以不顾长远利益和国家建设需要，进行超计划的滥伐，主要是因为该木材公司对国家木材资源情况认识不够，存在着只顾局部利益的糊涂思想。他们只知道采购木材是“积累资金”“解决财政困难”的好办法，却不知道森林与水旱灾害，以及木材与工矿交通建设的密切关系，所以，一开始便做好了各种“超额”采伐的准备，对有限的山林进行漫无节制的滥伐。（林利）
