Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 9th: According to TASS, French Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Duclos delivered a report at the plenary session of the French Communist Party Central Committee, which opened on September 7th. He analyzed the recent international situation and called on the French people to unite to fight against American domination, defend French independence, and stop the Vietnam War, which is against the interests of the French people.

    Duclos, after pointing out the disastrous consequences of the French reactionary rulers placing the country in the position of a servant of the United States, declared: The French people must not tolerate the shameless dictatorship that the United States is imposing on our heads. The French Communist Party is ready to fight side by side with all those who hope to restore French independence, those who hope to abolish the treaties that tie France to the war chariot of American imperialism, and those who hope to implement an independent policy in the political, economic, and military fields to protect French interests and maintain peace.

    Duclos said: The French Communist Party opposes turning the French army into a U.S.-ized army under Eisenhower's command. The French Communist Party demands the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with the Ho Chi Minh government, the withdrawal of the expeditionary force from Vietnam, and the conclusion of mutually beneficial economic agreements and cultural agreements to rebuild friendship and understanding between the French and Vietnamese peoples.

    Duclos said: It is quite obvious that the Plevin government, composed of a majority in the National Assembly that includes illegally elected members, cannot implement such an independent policy. De Gaulle's so-called French People's Rally is conspiring to rise to power with the help of the government majority, an action that will mark the beginning of a fascist seizure of power from above.

    Duclos finally called on the working masses within the Socialist Party and the Communists to join hands to fight against the common enemies of the working people and for the unity of the working class, which will enable all the French people to unite to stop fascism.

    法共中央全会开幕
    杜克洛号召保卫独立
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎九日讯：法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛在九月七日开幕的法共中央全体会议上作报告。他分析了最近以来的国际形势，号召法国人民团结起来，为反对美国的统治、保卫法国的独立和制止违反法国人民利益的越南战争而斗争。
    杜克洛指出法国的反动统治者使国家陷入美国的仆从的地位及其毁灭性后果之后宣称：法国人民决不能容忍美国正在强加于我国头上的无耻独裁。法国共产党准备毫无例外地与一切希望恢复法国独立的人们，希望废除把法国系在美帝国主义战车上的条约的人们以及希望在政治经济军事各方面实行保护法国利益和维护和平的独立政策的人们并肩战斗。
    杜克洛说：法国共产党反对把法国军队变为艾森豪威尔统辖下的美国化的军队的一部分。法国共产党要求立即与胡志明政府缔结和约，从越南撤退远征军，同时并缔结有利于双方的经济协定和重建法越人民友好与谅解的文化协定。
    杜克洛说：十分明显，包含非法选出的议员在内的国民议会多数派所组成的普利文政府是不能执行这种独立政策的。戴高乐的所谓法兰西人民联盟正阴谋借政府多数派的援助起而当权，这种行动将成为法西斯分子从上而下地夺取政权的开端。
    杜克洛最后号召社会党内的劳动群众和共产党人携手，为反对劳动人民的共同敌人、为工人阶级的团结而奋斗，这种团结将使所有法国人民联合起来制止法西斯主义。
