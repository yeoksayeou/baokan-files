    Problems Occur in the New Construction Project of Hangjiang Textile Factory
    Zhejiang Construction Company Should be Responsible for Inspection

    To the Editor:

    Recently, the Hangjiang Textile Factory in Hangzhou built new female workers' dormitories and sanatoriums. These projects were contracted to Zhejiang Construction Company. Due to insufficiently accurate design and a lack of thorough inspection by the client and designer before and during construction, some errors occurred in the project.

    The drawings for this project were designed and drawn by Xu Huigeng, a technician from Zhejiang Construction Company. Before the design, the factory had explained to him that each room should accommodate six beds. Xu himself had also gone to the site to measure the size of the beds and calculated the area each room should occupy. However, in his design, he included the wall space in the room area and did not account for the necessary gaps between the beds. This is a common knowledge in engineering, but he made a mistake. During construction, this was not noticed until the houses were built and the beds were arranged, when it was discovered that only five beds could be placed in each room. As a result, a total of twenty-four beds, equivalent to four rooms, were missing from the two buildings. If these four rooms were to be added, it would cost more than 40 million yuan.

    Xu Huigeng was originally a technician at the privately owned Xin Chang Construction Factory. In the past, the Hangjiang Textile Factory's projects were all contracted to Xin Chang. After this project was contracted to Xin Chang, it was designed by Xu Huigeng. Before the project started, Xin Chang joined the Zhejiang Construction Company in a joint venture. On May 25th, the Hangjiang Textile Factory officially signed a contract with the Construction Company, which, according to Article 3 of the contract, stipulated that "The contractor (Construction Company) should carefully study the drawings and specifications, and if there are any discrepancies or questions, the owner or the person in charge of the project should be consulted at any time, and no unauthorized misinterpretation should be made." However, the leading cadres of the Construction Company who contracted the project did not carefully review the drawings and blindly trusted Xu Huigeng and others' supervision. The person in charge of the Hangjiang Textile Factory did not conduct strict inspections of the design and construction either, only taking a cursory look and assuming there were no problems.

    After this error occurred, the Hangjiang Textile Factory sent people to negotiate with the Construction Company. However, Engineer Zhang of the company said: "The drawings were messed up by Xu, and the Construction Company is not responsible. You can make the beds a little smaller." We believe that this irresponsible attitude towards state property is very wrong.

### 杭江纱厂新建工程发生问题  浙江建筑公司应负责检查

    杭江纱厂新建工程发生问题
    浙江建筑公司应负责检查编辑同志：
    杭州市杭江纱厂最近新建了女工宿舍、疗养室。这些工程是委托浙江建筑公司承造的。由于设计不够正确，委托者与设计者在事前及施工中缺乏深入的检查，工程曾发生了一些错误。
    这项工程的图样是由浙江建筑公司的技术员徐会赓设计绘制的。在设计前，厂方对他讲明每间要放六张床铺。徐自己也曾实地到铺上量好尺寸，算好每一间房间应占的地位。但他在设计时，却把墙壁地位也算在房间面积内，并且没有把铺与铺之间应留的空隙估计进去。这本来是工程上的普通常识，但是他竟弄错了。在施工时，一直没有发觉，等房子造好，安排铺位时，才发现只能放五张床铺。这样二幢楼房一共要少放二十四张床，等于四间房。假如要再添造这四间房，就要多花四千多万元。
    徐会赓原为私营鑫昌营造厂的技术员。过去，杭江纱厂的工程都由鑫昌承做。这个工程该厂承做后即由徐会赓设计。在工程未开始时，鑫昌参加浙江建筑公司联营。五月二十五日杭江纱厂又与建筑公司正式签订合同，依照合同第三条规定：“凡图样说明书承包人（建筑公司）应详细研阅，如有不符之处或发生疑问，应随时请求业主或工程负责人解释，不得擅自曲解承做。”但承包工程的建筑公司领导干部对图样既没有详细审核，更盲目信任徐会赓等人的监工。杭江纱厂负责人对设计和施工也没有进行严格的检查，只草率看了一下，就以为没啥问题。
    此项错误发生后，杭江纱厂曾派人向建筑公司交涉。但该公司张工程师竟说：“图样是徐弄错的，建筑公司没有责任。你们床铺可以削小一点。”我们认为这种对国家财产不负责任的态度是很不对的。
