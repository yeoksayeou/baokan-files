Northeast China Summarizes Experiences in Patriotic Production Increase Competition
Will Fully Launch Autumn Harvest Competition Based on Existing Foundations
    The summer hoeing competition evaluation is currently underway in rural Northeast China. Now, in the gap between the end of hoeing and the autumn harvest, farmers throughout the region are launching a manure accumulation competition in preparation for next year's production; they are also preparing for the autumn harvest competition.

    This year's patriotic production increase competition has been widely carried out in rural Northeast China. This movement began this spring when the model mutual aid teams of Han En and Wang Zhijian in Northeast China challenged the Li Shunda mutual aid team. Subsequently, after publicity and deliberation, a large number of mutual aid teams in various regions participated in the competition, and many individual farmers also joined. During the spring plowing, production competition became a heated movement. At the beginning of the summer hoeing, various regions conducted summaries and evaluations of the spring plowing competition. After the evaluation, the enthusiasm of the farmers in Northeast China for the production increase competition was even higher. In addition, farmers in various regions responded to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association for increased production and donations, and more people participated in the competition. According to statistics from Heilongjiang Province in June, more than 27,000 mutual aid teams had participated in the competition, including 50 women's production mutual aid teams. There are currently no comprehensive statistics on the number of farmers participating in the competition in Northeast China. During the summer hoeing period, statistics from 58 counties showed 65,800 mutual aid teams, with at least 100,000 in the entire region. Statistics from other individual regions also show that the scale of this movement is very large. In Fuxian County, Liaodong Province, more than 2,800 mutual aid teams and more than 1,400 individual farmers participated in the competition. In ten counties including Hulan in Songjiang Province, more than 9,200 mutual aid teams participated. In five counties including Yushu and Panshi in Jilin Province, more than 24,000 mutual aid teams and more than 13,000 individual farmers participated.

    The gains from the movement have been very substantial. Under the education of patriotism, the farmers in Northeast China have a high level of determination and confidence in striving for increased production. "Increase production and harvest more grain to defend the country and protect our homes" has become the common slogan of farmers participating in the competition in various regions. Generally, the better mutual aid teams aim to increase production by 20% to 30% compared to last year. The Zhong Weifu mutual aid team in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, and the Li Kun mutual aid team in Nehe County both aim to increase production by 100%. The fear of development among some farmers after the land reform has been swept away by this year's patriotic production increase competition. Farmers participating in the competition pay attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation, and improve their techniques. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied to cultivated land in Northeast China has generally increased by 15% compared to last year; 80% of the seeds sown have been reselected by farmers, and 20% to 30% have been disinfected. Farmers are also very enthusiastic about developing special crops and cash crops. This year, the planting area of special crops and cash crops in Northeast China has exceeded the plan by 20%. The movement has promoted the participation of semi-labor forces such as rural women in production, and has enabled everyone to give full play to their abilities, thereby solving the difficulty of labor shortage in some areas during the busy farming season. This spring and summer, some areas in Northeast China have also experienced droughts and pests, but they have been overcome by the high level of production enthusiasm of the farmers in the movement. For example, farmers in Jilin Province came up with more than a dozen ways to fight drought and protect seedlings in June and July to overcome the drought. In May of this year, more than 30,000 women and old men in Tieling County participated in the fight against drought and catching insects. In addition, the mutual aid teams have become more consolidated than before due to the addition of new competition content.

    In the past six months, the following experiences have been gained in carrying out the production increase competition movement in rural Northeast China:

    First, the publicity of production policies must be combined with patriotic education for resisting America and aiding Korea. In-depth publicity and education work is the key to launching the movement. Farmers in Nianxingou Village, Fuxian County, Liaodong Province, were initially indifferent to participating in the competition; some of them thought that "the more you produce, the more you have to hand over as public grain," and some were afraid of being called "braggarts" if they proposed a production increase plan. After publicity and education, the farmers understood the production policies, improved their patriotic enthusiasm, and all joined the competition. After the 14 households in Shisi Household Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province, signed a patriotic pact, the number of mutual aid teams and farmers participating in the competition increased from 70% to 95%. After Xin'an Village, Liuhe County, Liaodong Province, proposed patriotic production increase donations, the number of farmers participating in the competition doubled.

    Second, the leadership of the movement must go deep into the mutual aid teams and farmers, help them make plans, and make them clearly aware of the goals of their struggle. The farmers in Fuyuan Village, Bayan County, Songjiang Province, did not make a plan at the beginning, and the farmers felt that there was nothing to compete for; after making a plan, they compared the plan to a street lamp, and they knew "what to do first and what to do more." This year's plan to expand the planting of special crops and cash crops in Northeast China was completed by making plans for the farmers.

    Third, each stage of the movement must be inspected, summarized, and awarded. The farmers themselves must conduct timely inspections and evaluations, and then the government will reward the model mutual aid teams and farmers. In this way, the farmers' enthusiasm for competition can be consolidated and improved, and the competition can continue. Some farmers in Zhaodong and other counties in Heilongjiang Province thought that the competition was over after the spring plowing; after the summary and awards, the upsurge of the competition rose again, and many mutual aid teams asked to "see you next time." The evaluation must be done by the masses of farmers, and must be based on the production policy and the main conditions of the competition. In the evaluation, on the one hand, establish the "banner" that the masses truly support, and on the other hand, review the shortcomings in the movement.

    Fourth, leaders should pay attention to going deep into the mutual aid teams to absorb experience, and promote it in a timely manner, so that the competition between groups and households gradually develops into a competition between villages and gradually extends from points to the whole area. In Minzhu Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, because the leaders went deep into the Yang Xianting mutual aid team in the village and used the experience of the group to promote the entire village, 95% of the farmers in the village participated in the competition. On the contrary, in the Lishu District of Xi'an County, Liaodong Province, because the leaders were afraid of "making it too big and becoming a mere formality," the movement always stayed at the point and was not promoted in time. Of course, in Shengli Village, Shuangliao County, Liaoxi Province, the leaders did not adopt the method of gradually developing experience, and "helped in a big way" without experience, and the result was a burst of excitement and then it was over - that is also undesirable.

    As far as the entire Northeast China is concerned, this year's patriotic production increase competition has been widely carried out, but it is also uneven. In some areas, the leaders isolated themselves and did not expand in time. In other areas, the enthusiasm of the movement was not full because they neglected the patriotic education of the farmers; some areas neglected the specific issues of improving farming techniques. Now, all parts of Northeast China are summarizing the experience of the movement and solving the above-mentioned problems; and on the existing basis, they will boldly and freely launch the patriotic production increase competition movement in Northeast China in an all-round way.

### 东北各地总结爱国丰产竞赛经验  将在已有的基础上全面展开秋收竞赛

    东北各地总结爱国丰产竞赛经验
    将在已有的基础上全面展开秋收竞赛
    东北农村正在进行夏锄竞赛的评比工作。现在是挂锄后秋收前的间隙，全区农民又为明年的生产开展着一个积肥的竞赛；他们并在为秋收竞赛作准备。
    今年的爱国丰产竞赛运动，在东北农村中开展得很广泛。这个运动是由今年春天东北的模范互助组韩恩互助组和王治俭互助组向李顺达互助组应战开始的。以后，经过宣传酝酿，各地互助组参加竞赛的极多，许多单干农户也参加了。在春耕中，生产竞赛就已成为热烈的运动。夏锄开始时，各地曾进行春耕竞赛的总结和评比，评比后，东北农民对丰产竞赛的热情更高，加以各地农民响应抗美援朝总会的增产捐献号召，参加竞赛的就更多了。据黑龙江省六月份的统计，参加竞赛的已有两万七千多个互助组，其中还有五十个妇女生产互助组。全东北参加竞赛的农民目前还没有全面的统计，夏锄期中，据五十八个县的统计是六万五千八百个互助组，全区至少在十万个以上。其他一些个别地区的统计，也可看出这个运动的规模是很大的。辽东省复县参加竞赛的有二千八百多个互助组和一千四百多户单干农户；松江省呼兰等十县参加竞赛的有九千二百多个互助组；吉林省榆树、磐石等五县参加竞赛的有二万四千多个互助组和一万三千多户单干农户。
    运动已有的收获是很丰富的。在爱国主义的教育下，东北农民对争取丰产的决心和信心都很高，“丰产多打粮，卫国保家乡”，成为各地参加竞赛的农民的共同口号。一般较好的互助组，都以比去年增产百分之二十到百分之三十为争取目标。黑龙江省拜泉县的仲维富互助组，讷河县的李坤互助组，都是以增产百分之百为目标。土地改革后一些农民怕发展的思想，已因今年的爱国丰产竞赛被扫除了。参加竞赛的农民都很注意深耕细作，提高技术。今年东北耕地施肥量一般比去年增加了百分之十五；播种的种籽百分之八十是经过农民复选的，百分之二十到百分之三十是消了毒的。农民对发展特种作物和商品作物也很热心，今年东北特种作物和商品作物播种面积超过计划百分之二十。运动推动了农村半劳动力如农村妇女参加生产，且使每个人高度发挥了自己的能力，从而解决了部分地区农忙中缺少劳动力的困难。今年春夏，东北也有部分地区发生过干旱和虫害，但都被运动中农民的高度的生产热情所战胜。如吉林省农民在六、七月间就想出十几种抗旱保苗的办法战胜了干旱，铁岭县今年五月，曾有三万多妇女、老汉，参加抗旱捉虫。此外，互助组因增加了竞赛的新内容也比前更加巩固了。
    半年来，东北农村在开展丰产竞赛运动中，已有以下几个经验：
    第一，宣传生产政策必须和抗美援朝的爱国教育相结合，深入的宣传教育工作，是开展运动的关键。辽东省复县碾信沟村的农民，最初对参加竞赛很冷淡；他们有的认为“打的多交公粮就多”，有的怕提出增产计划被别人说是“吹牛”。经过宣传教育以后，农民认识了生产政策，提高了爱国热情，就都卷入了竞赛运动。吉林省榆树县十四户村订爱国公约后，参加竞赛的互助组和农户就由百分之七十增加到百分之九十五。辽东省柳河县新安村提出爱国增产捐献后，参加竞赛的农民就增加了一倍。
    第二，运动的领导必须深入到互助组和农户，帮助他们订计划，使他们明确认识奋斗的目标。松江省巴彦县富原村开始没有订计划，农民就觉得没有什么好竞赛的；订计划后他们把计划比作路灯，就知道该“啥先干和啥多干”了。东北今年扩大播种特种作物和商品作物的计划，就是通过给农民订计划完成的。
    第三，运动每一阶段必须检查、总结和评奖，先由农民群众自己及时进行检查、评比，然后由政府对模范的互助组和农民加以奖励。这样，才能巩固和提高农民的竞赛热情，竞赛才能持续下去。黑龙江省肇东等县，有些农民以为春耕完了，竞赛也完了；总结和评奖以后，竞赛的热潮才又高涨起来，好些互助组要求“下回见”。评比必须由农民群众来评，要根据生产方针和竞赛的主要条件来评。评比中，一面树立群众真正拥护的“旗子”，一面要检讨运动中的缺点。
    第四，领导者要注意深入互助组吸取经验，及时加以推广，使组与组、户与户之间的竞赛，逐渐展开成为村屯之间的竞赛，并由点及面，逐步推广。黑龙江省克山县民主村，由于领导者深入该村杨显庭互助组，以该组的经验来推动全村，结果全村百分之九十五的农户都参加了竞赛。相反的，辽东省西安县梨树区，因领导者怕“搞大了流于形式”，结果使运动始终停留在点上，没有及时推广。当然，像辽西省双辽县的胜利村，领导者没有采用创造经验逐步开展的方法，在没有经验时就“大帮轰”，结果一阵热闹就完了——那样也是要不得的。
    就全东北说，今年的爱国丰产竞赛开展得很广泛，但也不平衡。部分地区因领导者孤立搞点没有及时展开。还有些地区因忽视对农民的爱国教育，运动的热情不饱满；有些地区又忽视了提高农作技术的具体问题。现在，东北各地都在总结运动的经验，解决上述存在的问题；并将在已有的基础上，大胆放手地使爱国丰产竞赛运动，在东北全面展开。
