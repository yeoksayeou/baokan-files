    Shenyang and Baoding Business Circles
    Respond to Wuhan Business Circle's Donation and Payment Competition
    Shanghai Business Circle Makes a Collective Payment of Nearly 90 Billion
    Bengbu Business Circle Revises Original Plan to Increase Airplane Donations
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce issued an open letter on September 7th, responding to the donation and payment competition of the Wuhan business community. The original text of the letter is as follows: Friends in the business communities of Wuhan and the northeastern provinces and cities:
    On the basis of extensively and deeply developing patriotic ideological education against the US and aiding Korea, we, the Shenyang business community, enthusiastically responded to the three patriotic appeals of the General Association Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and combined this with the two specific tasks of implementing patriotic covenants and doing a good job in providing preferential treatment. We launched a patriotic donation campaign starting in early June.
    After a month of in-depth propaganda and repeated deliberation from top to bottom and from bottom to top, especially under the encouragement and leadership of the working class, industrial and commercial operators throughout the city, on the premise of increasing production, increasing income, and saving expenses, formulated donation targets for various industries and determined a donation plan for the city's business community to donate 30 airplanes.
    Due to the conscientious promotion by various industries and the continuous increase in the patriotic enthusiasm of industrial and commercial operators, we have already paid 15,686,817,000 yuan according to the planned schedule by July 20th, completing the first phase of the donation plan for ten aircraft ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. This has laid a solid foundation for the completion of the entire donation plan.
    At present, in order to continue to maintain a tense war atmosphere so as to conclude an illegal peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan, American imperialism has consistently insisted on unreasonable demands in the Korean armistice negotiations, repeatedly attacked the Kaesong Neutral Zone, and strafed and bombed the residences of our negotiation delegation, deliberately sabotaging the armistice negotiations and continuing to adhere to its policy of aggression against Korea and Asia. Therefore, we must continue to deepen the patriotic movement to increase production and donations, and strengthen our strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, in order to completely smash the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.
    We, the Shenyang business community, are now preparing to complete our second phase of the payment plan for donating ten aircraft by September 30th of this year according to the planned schedule, so as to greet the second anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic of China with this practical action. We also guarantee to strive to overfulfill the entire payment plan by the end of this year, in order to have a friendly payment competition with you.
    Friends in the business communities of Wuhan and other brother cities in the Northeast: We are willing to use the above conditions to work together with you under the great banner of patriotism and internationalism, to strive to increase production and complete our future production increase and donation plans ahead of schedule, and to fight to the end for the final victory of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
    Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Baoding business community responded to the Wuhan business community's payment competition. Their conditions are: conscientiously implement the payment plan, pay the monthly donations before the 20th of each month, and guarantee to complete the half-year donation payment plan by the end of November.
    The Shanghai business community held a payment conference on September 1st, collectively paying donations of 89.3 billion yuan.
    The Bengbu Federation of Industry and Commerce held a meeting on August 22nd and decided to continue to improve operations and increase income, changing the original plan to donate one aircraft and one artillery piece to striving to donate three aircraft.

    沈阳和保定市工商界
    响应武汉工商界捐献缴款竞赛
    上海工商界一次集体缴款近九百亿
    蚌埠工商界改订原来计划增献飞机
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：沈阳市工商业联合会于九月七日发出公开信，响应武汉市工商界的捐献缴款竞赛。该信原文如下：武汉市及东北各省市工商界朋友们：
    我们沈阳市工商界在广泛深入展开抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育的基础上，热烈地响应了抗美援朝总会的三项爱国号召，结合贯彻爱国公约、做好优抚工作两项具体任务，从六月初展开了爱国捐献运动。
    经过一个月的深入宣传，进行了由上而下，由下而上的反覆酝酿，特别是在工人阶级的鼓舞和带头下，全市工商业者在增加生产、增加收入、节省开支的前提下，制订了各行业的捐献目标，并确定了全市工商界捐献飞机三十架的捐献计划。
    由于各行业的认真推动与工商业者爱国热情的不断高涨，我们已经按预定计划，在七月二十日以前，缴纳捐款一百五十六亿八千六百八十一万七千元，提前并超额完成了第一期捐献十架飞机的缴款计划，并为完成全部捐献计划打下了巩固的基础。
    目前美帝国主义为了继续保持紧张的战争空气，以便缔结非法的对日和约，重新武装日本，在朝鲜停战谈判中，始终坚持无理要求，一再袭击开城中立区，并扫射轰炸我谈判代表团的住所，蓄意破坏停战谈判，继续坚持其侵略朝鲜、侵略亚洲的政策。因此，我们就必须继续深入开展爱国增产捐献运动，加强我们的抗美援朝力量，以彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    我们沈阳市工商界现正准备按预定计划，在本年九月三十日以前完成我们第二期捐献飞机十架的缴款计划，以这一实际行动来迎接我们中华人民共和国诞生的二周年的国庆纪念日。并保证在本年末争取超额完成全部缴款计划，来向你们作友谊的缴款竞赛。
    武汉市及东北各兄弟城市的工商界朋友们：我们愿意拿以上的条件来和你们一道在伟大的爱国主义与国际主义的旗帜下，共同努力，为结合增加生产提前完成我们今后的增产捐献计划，争取抗美援朝战争的最后胜利而奋斗到底。
    沈阳市工商业联合会
    【本报讯】保定市工商界响应武汉市工商界缴款竞赛，他们的条件是：认真执行缴款计划，每月应缴的献款于当月二十日以前缴清，并保证于十一月底全部完成半年捐献缴款计划。
    上海市工商界于九月一日举行了缴款大会，集体缴纳献款达八百九十三亿元。
    蚌埠市工商联合会在八月二十二日开会，决定继续改善经营，增加收入，把原定捐献飞机一架、大炮一门的计划，改为争取捐献飞机三架。
