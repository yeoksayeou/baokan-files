    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 25th: Han Seol-ya, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, issued a statement on the 23rd, denouncing the US imperialist aggressive plot of a separate peace treaty with Japan. He said: US imperialism, disregarding all international agreements, forced its puppet countries to illegally sign a separate peace treaty with Japan in San Francisco. It has stubbornly violated the will of peace-loving people all over the world, placed no restrictions on the Japanese armed forces, and created a pretext for US troops to continue to be stationed on Japanese territory.
    After pointing out that the San Francisco treaty has failed to peacefully resolve the issues of Japan and Asia, Han Seol-ya emphasized: The San Francisco trickery is not for peace but for preparing a new war. We, the Korean people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely denounce the US imperialist aggressive plot of a separate peace treaty with Japan, and declare that this treaty, which violates international agreements, is invalid.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Tokyo News: Amidst the Japanese people's strong opposition to the US-British separate peace treaty with Japan, Japan's largest conservative trade union federation - the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (commonly known as "Sohyo"), demanded on the 22nd that Socialist Party legislators oppose the ratification of the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty." The eight leaders of "Sohyo" requested that Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, instruct all Socialist Party members of the Diet to vote against the ratification of these two treaties when the Diet holds a special session in October to approve them.
    On the 21st, the Japan National Conference for the Promotion of Peace, initiated by "Sohyo" and other organizations, held a representative conference. The conference also hoped that all members of the Socialist Party Diet would unanimously oppose the ratification of the separate peace treaty and the "Security Treaty."

    日本“总评”要求社会党议员反对国会批准美制条约
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长韩雪野于二十三日发表谈话，痛斥美国单独对日媾和的侵略阴谋。他说：美帝国主义无视一切国际协定，强迫其仆从国家在旧金山非法地签订了对日单独和约。它蛮横地违反全世界爱好和平人民的意志，对日本武装力量毫无限制，并制造了美军继续留驻日本领土的藉口。
    韩雪野在指出旧金山和约并没有能够和平解决日本及亚洲问题之后，强调说：旧金山的鬼把戏绝不是为了和平而是为了准备新战争。我们朝鲜人民与全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决痛斥美帝国主义对日单独和约的侵略阴谋，并宣布这种违反国际协定的和约是无效的。
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：在日本人民强烈反对美英单独对日和约的情况下，日本最大的保守的工会联合会组织——日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”），于二十二日要求社会党议员反对批准单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”。“总评”的八名领袖要求社会党中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎指令社会党的所有国会议员在国会于十月间举行特别会议批准这两个条约时，投反对票。
    二十一日，由“总评”等团体发起组织的日本推进和平国民会议，曾举行代表大会。大会也希望社会党的全体国会议员一致反对批准单独和约和“安全条约”。
