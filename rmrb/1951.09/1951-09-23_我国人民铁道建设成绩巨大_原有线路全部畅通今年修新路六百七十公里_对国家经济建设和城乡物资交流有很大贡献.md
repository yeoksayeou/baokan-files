Since the founding of the Central People's Government two years ago, the People's Railway has achieved tremendous development, making great contributions to national economic construction and urban-rural material exchange. After the last section of the original North Tongpu Railway between Yuanping and Shuoxian was opened to traffic on July 1 this year, all original lines in mainland China and Hainan Island were open, with a total length of more than 22,600 kilometers. Since the second half of 1950, the Ministry of Railways has started to build new lines – the Tianshui-Lanzhou, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Laibin-Zhennan Pass lines. The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is a major artery for the development of the Northwest, winding through towering mountains, and the project is extremely arduous. It is currently being rushed. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is a section of the Sichuan-Han Railway, which the people of Sichuan have longed for for more than 40 years. The Chongqing-Yongchuan section was opened to traffic on September 1 this year, and it is expected to be fully completed next year. The Laibin-Zhennan Pass section is the last section of the Xiang-Gui Railway, which the Kuomintang planned for 13 years but failed to realize. The Laibin-Nanning section was opened to traffic in March this year, and it is expected to be fully completed in mid-November this year. The construction plan for these three railways this year totals 670 kilometers. This is a large figure in the history of railway construction in China. According to statistics: In the 48 years before 1927, China only built an average of 199 kilometers per year. From 1928 to 1941, the average annual construction was only 440 kilometers. (The above figures do not include the South Manchuria, China Eastern, and Yunnan-Vietnam railways invested by foreigners, and the railways built by the Japanese invaders in China after the "September 18th Incident.")

The efficiency of railway transportation has improved significantly. In 1950, the volume of freight transported by railways nationwide, calculated in ton-kilometers, increased by 510.6 percent compared to 1935 before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the first half of 1951 increased by 50.2 percent compared to the same period last year. In 1950, the number of passengers transported, calculated in passenger-kilometers, increased by 383.2 percent compared to 1935. In the first half of this year, the area within the customs increased by 3.9 percent compared to the same period last year.

Since 1949, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has implemented a planned transportation system to closely cooperate with the national economic construction plan and implement the policy of serving industry and agriculture. Last year, the railway cooperated with the national price stabilization policy and carried out a huge material transfer work, completing the national transportation plan 21 days ahead of schedule. The transportation of major materials such as coal, grain, cotton, steel, timber, ore, and salt all exceeded the plan. This year, in addition to ensuring national defense transportation, the railway department has closely cooperated with the needs of industrial production, water conservancy construction, and agricultural production. The railway has played a major role in supplying industrial fuel and raw materials. For example, Shanghai's coal consumption has greatly increased due to the rapid recovery and development of industry this year. The railway department transported nearly 400,000 tons of coal to the Shanghai area from January to August, which is equivalent to the total amount of fuel coal supplied to East China through the railway last year. In order to meet the needs of the development of the textile industry, the northern and southern railway departments transported more than 224,000 tons of cotton from rural areas to major cities this year. This year, railway transportation also played a major role in the national Yellow River and Huai River water conservancy projects. The Jinan Railway Bureau alone transported 350,000 tons of gravel to the Huai River and Yellow River water conservancy work areas from March to July this year, enabling the project to be carried out in a timely manner. This spring, railway transportation made unprecedented contributions to cooperating with rural production, especially expanding the production of industrial crops and local and special products. In order to meet the needs of farmers to increase production after land reform, the railway department transported more than 700,000 tons of soybean cake to rural areas for fertilizing fields in the first half of this year. In order to cooperate with the implementation of industrial crop production increase plans in various places, in February this year alone, the railway department transported 140,000 tons of fuel coal to the cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province, so that farmers could actively plant cotton after obtaining fuel (local farmers used to use sorghum stalks, corn stalks, etc. as fuel). Before the rainy season this year, the famous tobacco-producing area of Xuchang, Henan Province, needed a large amount of coal for flue-curing tobacco. The railway department transported 75,000 tons of flue-curing coal on schedule, helping tobacco production.

The exchange of local and special products, which had been blocked by the war for more than ten years, has become unprecedentedly active due to the smooth flow of railways. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, tea farmers in Hunan, Anhui and other places cut down many tea trees for firewood because of the blockage of tea sales, while farmers in Guangdong let bananas rot as fertilizer. Since the southern and northern railways have been unblocked, tea, bananas, etc. have been selling well in North China and Northeast China, and tea has even been sold to the Northwest border. In particular, after the opening of China-Soviet railway combined transportation business, tea from Central South and East China, and special products such as cinnamon, fennel, and star anise from Guangdong and Guangxi were also sold to the Soviet Union and new democratic countries in Eastern Europe. The good sales of these special and local products have played a major role in promoting the development of the national economy and improving the lives of the people, especially farmers. For example, wheat in the Shijiazhuang area has greatly increased its production because it has received arsenic fertilizer transported from Hunan. In addition, tea farmers in various tea-producing areas have successively repaired tea mountains, increased tea planting, and increased production. Anhua County, Hunan Province, only produced more than 20,000 dan of tea in 1949, but increased its production to 100,000 dan in 1950. The number of tea factories has also increased from a dozen or so before liberation to fifty. In Mapixiang Township, the majority of tea farmers had a surplus of one to five dan of grain at home this year, and many tea farmers added several new sets of clothes.

The flourishing of urban-rural and domestic-foreign material exchange, which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, is not only due to the implementation of planned transportation by the railway, but also due to the encouragement of freight rate policies. The railway department has placed necessities for people's livelihood and industrial and agricultural production materials and production tools such as grain, timber, coal, ore, cement, steel, and machinery at lower levels to reduce freight rates. At present, except for a few luxury goods, the freight rates for general goods are much lower than before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Compared with 1937, the current freight rate for coal is 62 percent lower than in the past, salt is 69 percent lower, millet is 65 percent lower, flour is 54 percent lower, and cotton is 59 percent lower. For export materials such as tea, tung oil, eggs, wool, and silk, there are also special prices that reduce the originally set freight rates by 30 to 50 percent. In addition, special prices for various local products have been stipulated this year, such as fresh and salted dried fish and shrimp, Chinese skullcap, persimmons, fresh fruits, etc., all of which are reduced by 10 to 50 percent from the originally set freight rates.

    我国人民铁道建设成绩巨大
    原有线路全部畅通今年修新路六百七十公里
    对国家经济建设和城乡物资交流有很大贡献
    中央人民政府成立两年以来，人民铁路已得到巨大发展，对于国家经济建设和城乡物资交流有很大贡献。今年七月一日全国原有线路中最后一段北同蒲路原平、朔县间通车后，我国大陆和海南岛原有线路即全部畅通，全长二万二千六百多公里。从一九五○年下半年起铁道部已开始修建新线——天兰、成渝、来镇等线，天兰铁路是开发西北的大动脉，蜿延于崇山峻岭中，工程极为艰巨，现正加紧赶筑中。成渝铁路是四川人民渴望了四十多年的川汉铁路的一段，今年九月一日重庆、永川间已经通车，预计明年可以全线修通。来镇段是国民党计划了十三年而未实现的湘桂铁路的最后一段，其中来宾、南宁间已经于今年三月间通车，预计今年十一月中旬可以全部通车。今年这三条铁路的修建计划共长六百七十公里。这在中国铁路修建史上是很大的数字。据统计：中国在一九二七年以前四十八年中，平均每年只修一百九十九公里，一九二八年到一九四一年平均每年修路也只修四百四十公里。（上述数字，不包括外人投资的南满、中东、滇越等路及“九一八”后，日寇在中国所修的铁路。）
    铁路运输工作效率已有显著提高。一九五○年全国铁路运输货物以延吨公里计算比抗战以前一九三五年提高了百分之五百一十点六，而一九五一年上半年又比去年同时期提高了百分之五十点二。一九五○年运送旅客以延人公里计算，比一九三五年提高了百分之三百八十三点二。今年上半年关内比去年同时期提高了百分之三点九。
    中央人民政府铁道部从一九四九年起就实行了以计划运输制度来紧密地配合国家经济建设计划、贯彻为工业农业服务的方针。去年铁路配合国家稳定物价政策，曾从事庞大的物资调运工作，并提前二十一天完成国家运输计划。主要物资如煤、粮、棉花、钢铁、木材、矿石、盐等的运输都超额完成计划。今年铁路部门除保证国防运输外，并密切配合了工业生产、水利建设和农业生产的需要。在供应工业燃料和原料方面铁路起了很大的作用，譬如今年上海因工业恢复发展很快，用煤量大增，铁路部门就在一月至八月间运了将近四十万吨煤到上海一带，相当于去年全年经由铁路供应华东地区的燃煤。为了配合纺织业发展的需要，今年北方、南方铁路部门从农村运了二十二万四千多吨棉花到各大都市。今年国家治黄治淮水利工程中，铁路运输也起了很大作用。仅济南铁路局今年三月到七月间，就运了三十五万吨石碴到淮河和黄河水利工区。使工程得以及时进行。今年春天，铁路运输在配合农村生产，特别是扩大工业作物生产和土、特产生产方面，更作了空前未有的贡献。铁路部门为了满足土地改革后农民增产的要求，今年上半年运送了七十多万吨豆饼到农村肥田。为了配合各地实现工业作物的增产计划，仅今年二月间，铁路部门就运了十四万吨燃煤到河北省棉产区，使农民得到燃料后，好积极种棉（当地农民过去多用高粱秆、玉蜀秆等作燃料）。今年雨季以前，我国著名烟叶产区河南许昌一带需要大量煤炭烤烟，铁路部门就按计划及时运到七万五千吨烤烟煤，帮助了烟叶生产。
    被战争阻塞了十余年的土、特产交流，已因铁路畅通空前活跃起来。在抗日战争和解放战争期间，因为茶叶销路阻塞，湖南、安徽等地的茶农把许多茶树砍了当柴烧，广东的农民则让香蕉烂了作肥料。自从南方、北方铁路畅通后，茶叶、香蕉等就盛销华北、东北各地，茶叶并远销到西北边疆。特别是中苏铁路联运业务开办后，中南和华东区的茶叶，广东、广西的特产桂皮、茴香、八角等也远销到苏联和东欧新民主主义国家。这些特产、土产的畅销，对于促进国民经济的发展和人民特别是农民生活的改善，已起了很大作用。如石家庄一带的麦子，就因为得到从湖南运来的砒霜作肥料，而增产很多。又如各地茶产区茶农已纷纷修整茶山，增种茶树增加生产。湖南安化县在一九四九年只产茶两万多担，到一九五零年就增产到了十万担。茶厂也由解放前的十数家增加到了五十家。该县马皮乡在解放前经常闹粮荒，今年绝大部分茶农家里都有了一石到五石的余粮，许多茶农都添置了几套新衣服。
    上述有利国计民生的城乡、内外物资交流的畅旺，除由于铁路实行了计划运输以外，还由于得到运价政策的鼓励。铁路部门把民生必需品和工业农业生产资料生产工具如粮谷、木材、煤、矿石、洋灰、钢铁、机器等，放在较低等级上，以减低运价。目前除了少数奢侈品外，一般货物的运价都较抗战以前低得多。以现行几种民生必需品的运价和一九三七年相比，现在的煤的运价比过去低百分之六十二，盐低百分之六十九，小米低百分之六十五，面粉低百分之五十四，棉花减低百分之五十九。对于出口物资如茶叶、桐油、蛋品、羊毛、绸缎等二十四种物资，又订有按原订运价减低百分之三十到五十的特价。另外，今年又规定了各种土产的特价，如鲜货咸干鱼虾、黄苓、柿子、鲜水果等，都按原订运价减收百分之十到五十。（新华社）
