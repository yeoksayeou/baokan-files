    North China Militia Representatives Arrive in the Capital
    To be Reviewed by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu During National Day
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The North China militia, who have been tempered in the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War and have made significant contributions, have selected representatives to participate in this year's National Day grand military parade in the capital, as an important part of the country's armed forces, along with various branches of the People's Liberation Army. A total of 415 militia representatives will participate in this review. They come from various regions of North China, from the plains of Hebei and Pingyuan, and from the Taihang Mountains, the Saiwai Daqing Mountains, and the Inner Mongolia grasslands. They are all heroes and models of various types, including those who supported the front lines, cleared bandits, maintained public security, protected roads, protected warehouses, and engaged in production. This includes five representatives who attended the National Combat Heroes Representative Meeting: Li Dianbing, a militia hero and sharpshooter during the Anti-Japanese War; Hao Qingshan, a combat hero who killed, wounded, and captured over a hundred enemies during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, scaring the enemy; Yuan Xiang, a Hebei militia hero who led a militia company to persist on the front lines, killing and wounding more than 270 enemies during the Liberation War; Xu Shunhai, a militia hero who was famous in the Taihang Mountains during the Anti-Japanese War and persisted in the cave defense of Changxing Village (Huguan, Shanxi); and Huang Xiaodan, the company commander of the Taihang militia "Strong Company" who followed the army across the Yellow River to expedition to the Dabie Mountains during the Liberation War. In addition, there is Li Yong, the famous blasting hero of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region who used landmine warfare to kill and wound Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War; Chen Bingchang, who killed twenty-seven Japanese invaders and was awarded the title of First-Class Combat Hero of the Taihang Region; San Dan (Mongolian), the Inner Mongolia wolf-fighting model who eliminated wolves and achieved prosperity for both humans and livestock; and Shuang Bao (Mongolian), the Inner Mongolia forest protection model. In the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, these heroes and models have continued to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, using vigorous fighting spirit to take the lead among the people in completing arduous tasks such as clearing bandits, maintaining public security, increasing production and donating, and supporting the army in plowing. They all consider it a great honor to be selected to come to the capital this time to represent the people's armed forces and be reviewed by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Jiao Wenxiang, the road protection model of the Baoding sub-district, was selected as a representative, and his whole family was very happy. His mother said to him: "You have worked hard these past few years, and it is truly an honor to be able to see Chairman Mao this time. Don't worry about the autumn harvest at home, go and see Chairman Mao!" She immediately tore off several feet of cloth and rushed to make new clothes for him. When they left, they were warmly welcomed by the villages, districts, counties, and military regions of various provinces. The militias in various places warmly hoped that their representatives would successfully complete this glorious task and bring back the instructions of the leaders of the Central People's Government. After the militia representatives arrived in the capital, Tang Yanjie, Chief of Staff of the North China Military Region, Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Political Department, and other leaders personally went to express their condolences and give speeches, which greatly encouraged everyone. Everyone deeply realized the great political significance of this military parade. At present, all the militia representatives are actively training with glorious and excited hearts, preparing for National Day. On October 1st, this strong, brave, and heroic team, which has been tempered in war, will pass through Tiananmen Square in the capital and accept the glorious review of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the leaders of the Central People's Government.
