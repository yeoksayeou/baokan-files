    The summer vacation has ended, and students across the country have engaged in various meaningful activities during the summer.
    During the summer vacation, students in various places responded to the call of the China People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons, and participated in various voluntary labor to increase production and make donations. In Beijing, more than 1,300 male students from 33 schools participated in搬运 work in the second half of July, and 1,400 female students from 15 girls' schools went to garment factories in mid-July to sew cotton quilts. In Northeast China, a large number of students, in order to increase production and make donations, organized many labor construction teams by city or school to participate in production in factories and rural areas. Students in Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou and other cities also actively participated in charity performances, copying, repairing machine parts, and making specimens, donating the proceeds from their labor to purchase airplanes and cannons.
    Students in various places also carried out publicity among the masses regarding Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries. College and middle school students in Guizhou, North Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi and other places conducted publicity in county towns or in the countryside. Students on Hainan Island widely organized rural work teams, combining with local work to promote the significance of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement.
    Students also carried out various learning activities during the summer vacation. Students from colleges and universities or engineering and technical schools in various places went deep into factories and mines for internships in order to combine theoretical knowledge with practice. There were 7,000 students participating in internships in Northeast China and 4,000 in East China. Some places organized visits and trips to conduct patriotic education for students. Northeast students organized the "Northeast Students Capital Travel Group," and more than 300 students from Tianjin visited the old revolutionary base area of Baiyangdian in central Hebei. Students in various places also conducted many scientific and technological research activities. Beijing students organized biology research groups, aircraft model groups, and radio research groups to study Michurin's theories, manufacture various aircraft models and radio receivers, etc. Students from the Southwest Industrial College successfully imitated the production of slide rules during the summer vacation, which not only solved the difficulties in learning, but also increased production and donations. In addition, students in various places also established many "literary reading groups" to systematically read literary works and organize literary lectures.
    The widespread development of military sports activities is one of the characteristics of this year's summer vacation. Many cities have set up summer camps for youth or children. Nearly 10,000 college and middle school students and children participated in summer camps in the Northeast region. Swimming has become the students' favorite activity, and swimming competitions have been held in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Changsha and other places. With the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, students from various schools in Beijing held camping, target practice and other military sports activities in the suburbs. The Harbin Student Summer Camp also held marching exercises.
    Now, schools in various places have started, and the students have returned to their schools with a hundredfold spirit. In this new semester, they will study even harder for the motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国学生度过了有意义的暑假
    暑假已经结束，全国各地学生在暑假中进行了各种有意义的活动。
    在暑假中，各地学生为响应中国人民抗美援朝总会增产捐献飞机大炮的号召，参加了各种义务劳动增产捐献。北京有三十三个学校的男学生一千三百余人在七月下半月参加了搬运工作，十五个女学校的一千四百个女学生在七月中到被服厂缝制棉被。东北的大批学生为增产捐献，以市或以学校为单位组织了许多劳动建设队，到工厂和农村中去参加生产。上海、天津、西安、重庆、广州等市的学生也纷纷参加义演、抄写、修理机件、制作标本等工作，将劳动所得捐购飞机大炮。
    各地学生并向广大群众进行了有关抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命的宣传。贵州、川北、广东、广西等地大、中学生在县城或到乡下进行宣传。海南岛的学生广泛地组织了下乡工作队，结合当地工作，宣传抗美援朝运动的意义。
    学生们在暑假期间还进行了各种学习活动。各地高等学校或工科、技术学校的学生为使理论知识与实践相结合，曾深入工厂、矿山实习。东北各地参加实习的学生有七千人，华东有四千人。有的地方为了对学生进行爱国主义教育，组织了参观和旅行。东北学生组织了“东北学生首都旅行团”，天津市学生三百余人到冀中白洋淀老根据地去访问。各地学生还作了许多科学技术研究活动。北京学生组织了生物研究组、航空模型组和无线电研究组，研究米丘林的学说，制造各种飞机模型和无线电收音机等。西南工业专科学校的学生在暑假中仿制计算尺成功，不仅解决了学习上的困难，而且还可以增产捐献。此外，各地学生还成立了许多“文艺阅读小组”，有计划地阅读文艺作品和组织文艺讲座。
    广泛开展军事体育活动是今年暑假的特点之一。许多城市都设立了青年或儿童的夏令营。东北区参加夏令营的大、中学生与少年儿童将近一万人。游泳成了学生最喜爱的活动，北京、天津、上海、长沙等地都举行了游泳比赛。北京各校的学生取得解放军的协助，在近郊举办了露营、打靶等军事体育活动。哈尔滨市的学生夏令营还举办了行军演习。
    现在，各地学校已经开学，学生们都精神百倍地回到了自己的学校。在这个新的学期中，他们将为祖国更加努力地学习。（新华社）
