Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Tokyo News: As the date for the US-orchestrated signing of the unilateral Japanese peace treaty draws closer, the Japanese people's movement against the US trusteeship of Amami Oshima has become increasingly fierce. Collective hunger strikes, strikes, and signature campaigns have been held in various parts of Amami Oshima, expressing their determination to oppose the trusteeship.

According to the Asahi Shimbun on August 6th: 8,000 citizens of Naze City, Amami Oshima, gathered at the city's elementary school from 10:00 PM on August 4th to 10:00 PM on the 5th, holding a collective 24-hour hunger strike. Restaurants, cinemas, markets, shops, etc. in the city went on strike successively from August 5th to 6th, resolutely demanding the return of the island to Japan and opposing US trusteeship.

Furthermore, according to the Jiji Press on August 9th: Among the 220,000 residents currently living on the island, 99.8 percent of those aged 14 and above have signed petitions demanding the return of Amami Oshima to Japan. Some of them are extremely resentful of the Yoshida government's indifference to the island's return.

In addition, approximately 180,000 people originally from Amami Oshima but scattered throughout the Japanese mainland, led by the famous writer of Amami origin, Noboru Shomura, and Supreme Court Judge Yuichiro Tanimura, established the "Territorial Reversion Countermeasures Committee" in Tokyo at the end of July. They mobilized organizations such as the "Amami Federation" and the "Amami Student Association" to launch a million-signature campaign against US trusteeship in Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, and other places. According to Tokyo Broadcasting on August 11th, more than 900,000 signatures have already been collected.
