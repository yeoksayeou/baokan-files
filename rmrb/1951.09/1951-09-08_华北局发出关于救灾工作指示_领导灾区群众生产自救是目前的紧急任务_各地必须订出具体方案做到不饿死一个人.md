    North China Bureau Issues Instructions on Disaster Relief Work
    Leading the Masses in Disaster Areas to Self-Reliance Through Production is the Urgent Task
    All Localities Must Formulate Specific Plans to Ensure No One Starves
    On August 28th, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions regarding disaster relief work. The instructions began by stating: "Famine has already formed in some areas of North China, and a small number of disaster victims are pessimistic and despondent. Counter-revolutionary elements are taking the opportunity to spread rumors and engage in sabotage. Therefore, leading the masses in disaster areas to self-reliance through production has become the urgent task of all Communist Party committees and people's governments in disaster areas, and all localities must ensure that no one starves." The instructions emphasized: "The success or failure of this work is directly related to the lives of the broad masses of disaster victims and next year's production." Therefore, the instructions required all levels of Communist Party organizations in North China to advise local people's governments to immediately take the following measures:
    1. Implement the policy of self-reliance through production. At present, in addition to continuing to mobilize the masses to actively eliminate pests, drain water, collect substitute foods, and organize sideline production, and to formulate winter production and disaster relief plans as early as possible, it is even more important to do a good job in autumn sowing, autumn land preparation (autumn plowing), gleaning grain stalks, and digging up insect eggs in disaster-stricken areas after the autumn harvest to prevent disasters from recurring next year.
    2. All disaster areas must start production and self-reliance work as early as possible. In the past, some disaster areas often suffered greatly due to late action. This year, the Communist Party Committee of Chahar Province adopted the policy of quickly organizing production and self-reliance in response to the disaster. In the face of a severe drought, it also put forward the slogan of striving for a 50% harvest, which inspired the morale of the people in the disaster area. The province has also made great achievements in sideline production, and this approach is correct. Some disaster areas are taking a delaying and waiting approach to this work, which is wrong and must be corrected quickly.
    3. Continue to strengthen patriotic education among the broad masses, overcome negative emotions, and promote the spirit of "man can conquer nature." In the work, vigilance must be heightened to prevent sabotage activities by counter-revolutionary elements.
    4. Adapt to local conditions. In mountainous areas, the problem of transportation must be solved to facilitate the exchange of materials between the mountains and the plains. In flood-stricken areas, unified leadership should be given to encourage disaster victims to actively drain water and expand the wheat planting area, and to find a variety of ways to engage in production.
    5. Do a good job in the exchange of materials in disaster areas, purchase local and special products from disaster areas, and supply disaster area farmers with large quantities of grain, wheat seeds, and necessary production materials. Strengthen market management in disaster areas to prevent unscrupulous merchants from driving down purchase prices or raising prices. Regulate livestock fodder and issue loans to protect livestock, prevent the slaughter and sale of draft animals, in order to benefit production in the coming year.
    6. Saving for disaster preparedness should become a perennial slogan. Promote the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual relief among the masses. According to the different conditions in various places, establish charitable granaries or reward savings to gradually lay the foundation for long-term disaster preparedness.
    7. Leading cadres take responsibility and everyone participates. All disaster areas should send cadres with disaster relief experience to severely affected areas to express condolences and distribute relief grain, and to help local people organize production. Where possible, medical teams should be mobilized to go to disaster areas to help disaster victims with epidemic prevention and treatment of diseases.
    The instructions finally required Communist Party committees at all levels to advise local people's governments to, based on the disaster situation and after careful calculation, formulate production and self-reliance plans based on households, and organize forces to quickly invest in the production and self-reliance movement in disaster areas.

    华北局发出关于救灾工作指示
    领导灾区群众生产自救是目前的紧急任务
    各地必须订出具体方案做到不饿死一个人
    中共中央华北局于八月二十八日发出关于救灾工作指示。指示首称：华北部分地区的灾荒已经形成，少数灾民有悲观失望情绪，反革命分子乘机造谣破坏。因此，领导灾区群众生产自救成为目前所有灾区共产党委员会和人民政府的紧急任务，各地必须做到不饿死一个人。指示着重指出：这一工作的好坏直接关系到广大灾民的生活和明年的生产问题。因此，指示要求华北各级共产党组织建议各地人民政府立即采取以下措施：
    一、贯彻生产自救方针。目前除继续发动群众积极除虫、排水、采集代食品、组织副业生产，并及早订好冬季生产救灾计划外，更应做好秋后灾荒区域的秋种、秋垡地（秋耕）、拾谷茬、挖虫卵等工作，防止明年继续发生灾害。
    二、各灾区必须及早动手生产自救工作。历年来某些灾区常因动手晚，吃亏甚大。共产党察哈尔省委员会今年对灾荒采取迅速动手组织生产自救的方针，在严重旱灾面前，还提出争取五成年景的口号，鼓舞了灾区人民的斗志。在副业生产方面，该省也有很大成绩，这种作法是正确的。有些灾区对这一工作采取拖延、等待的作法是错误的，必须迅速纠正。
    三、继续加强对广大群众的爱国主义教育，克服消极情绪，发扬“人定胜天”的精神。工作中必须提高警惕，防止反革命分子的破坏活动。
    四、因地制宜。在山区要解决交通运输问题，以利山地和平原的物资交流。在水灾区要统一领导灾民积极排水，扩大种麦面积，要多种多样地寻找生产门路。
    五、做好灾区的物资交流工作，收购灾区土产、特产，大量供给灾区农民以粮食、麦种和生产必需品。加强灾区市场管理，防止奸商压价收购或哄抬物价。调剂畜草，发放保护牲畜贷款，防止宰杀和出卖耕畜，以利来年生产。
    六、节约备荒应成为常年口号。发扬群众互助互济的精神。根据各地不同情况，举办义仓或奖励储蓄，逐渐打下长期备荒的基础。
    七、首长负责，大家动手。各灾区应派出有救灾经验的干部到重灾区进行慰问和发放救济粮食，并帮助当地群众组织生产。在可能条件下，应动员医疗队赴灾区帮助灾民防疫和治疗疾病。
    指示最后要求各级共产党委员会建议当地人民政府根据灾情，经过精打细算，订出以户为基础的生产自救方案，并组织力量迅速投入灾区的生产自救运动中去。（新华社）
