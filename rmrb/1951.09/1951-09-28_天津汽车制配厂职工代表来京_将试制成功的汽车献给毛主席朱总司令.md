    Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant Worker Representatives Come to Beijing
    To Present Successfully Trial-Produced Cars to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    [Our Newspaper] Representatives of the workers of the Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant were dispatched on September 25th, driving two cars successfully trial-produced by the plant to Beijing, to present them to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu as gifts to celebrate the second anniversary of the National Day. Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally accepted the gifts on the afternoon of the 26th and spoke to the worker representatives of the plant, pointing out that the successful trial production of cars by the plant's workers is a manifestation of the boundless creative power of the Chinese working class and proves that the Chinese people have full confidence in building a new China's industry and national defense. Commander-in-Chief Zhu encouraged the worker representatives to make persistent efforts, research and improve, and manufacture more cars to meet the needs of national economic construction and national defense. After finishing his speech, Commander-in-Chief Zhu carefully observed the internal and external structure of the car for a long time, expressing his satisfaction. Acting Chief of the General Staff Nie instructed the worker representatives to continue to seek improvements to make it suitable for use on various roads. The worker representatives firmly stated that they must continue to work hard to strengthen the economic construction and national defense construction of the new China.
    The cars successfully trial-produced by the plant's workers this time, apart from the carburetor, gasoline pump, gearbox, and front and rear differential gearboxes, the main components such as the engine are all manufactured by themselves. The successful trial production of cars by the plant's workers is still a pioneering achievement in Chinese history. On September 25th, the worker representatives of the plant took four hours and twenty minutes to drive the successfully trial-produced cars from Tianjin to Beijing, traveling at 30 kilometers per hour, and spending one gallon of gasoline for every 24.7 kilometers traveled, and the condition of the car was quite good.
    The Central Heavy Industry Department solemnly held a celebration meeting on September 26th to celebrate the successful trial production of the car, and issued a silk banner and a bonus of 50 million yuan to the workers of the Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant. (Xia Yuan)

    天津汽车制配厂职工代表来京
    将试制成功的汽车献给毛主席朱总司令
    【本报讯】天津汽车制配厂职工已于九月二十五日派出代表，将该厂试制成功的两辆汽车开来北京，献给毛主席和朱总司令，作为庆祝国庆两周年的礼物。朱总司令在二十六日下午亲自接受献礼，并对该厂职工代表讲话，指出该厂职工试制汽车成功，是中国工人阶级有无限创造力量的表现，并且证明了中国人民有充分的信心建设新中国的工业和国防。朱总司令勉励工人代表，再接再厉，研究改进，多多制造汽车，以满足国家经济建设与国防事业的需要。朱总司令讲话完毕后，细心观察汽车内外部构造多时，表示满意。聂代总参谋长嘱咐工人代表还要不断讲求改进，使它适于在各种路上使用。工人代表坚决表示，一定要为加强新中国的经济建设和国防建设继续努力奋斗。
    该厂职工此次试制成功的汽车，除了化油器、汽油泵、变速箱、前后差速齿轮箱而外，主要的机件如引擎等均是自己制造的，但该厂职工此次试制汽车成功，还是中国历史上的创举。在九月二十五日，该厂职工代表以四点又二十分钟的时间，把试制成功的汽车从天津开到北京，每小时走行三十公里，走行二十四点七公里花费汽油一加仑，而汽车的状态颇为良好。
    中央重工业部曾于九月二十六日隆重举行汽车试制成功庆祝大会，并发给天津汽车制配厂职工锦旗一面和奖金五千万元。  （夏园）
