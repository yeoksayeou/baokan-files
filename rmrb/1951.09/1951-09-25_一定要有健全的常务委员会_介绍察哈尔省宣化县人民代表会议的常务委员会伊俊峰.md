It is essential to have a sound Standing Committee
    —Introducing Yi Junfeng of the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference of Xuanhua County, Chahar Province

The Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference of all circles in Xuanhua County, Chahar Province, was established at the first representative conference in December 1949. Over the past year, the Standing Committee has done a lot of work and achieved considerable results, becoming a powerful lever in the construction of the county's People's Representative Conference system. The Standing Committee of the county initially had 25 members. Over the past year, after successive re-elections and additions through six representative conferences, there are now 29 members (including the chairman, who is the county magistrate; two vice-chairmen, one being the secretary of the Xuanhua County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the other a farmer representative). Among the 29 Standing Committee members, there are 7 cadres from county-level agencies and organizations, 16 farmer representatives, 2 representatives from the cultural and educational fields, 1 representative from the medical field, 1 representative from the industrial and commercial sector, and 2 specially invited representatives. In March of this year, according to the resolution of the Fifth People's Representative Conference, a resident office of the Standing Committee was established. Initially, two Standing Committee members were selected to reside, and later, due to work needs, the number of resident Standing Committee members was increased to four.

The Standing Committee has initially formed a meeting system. Up to now, a total of twelve meetings have been held. Except for the second, fifth, seventh, tenth, and twelfth meetings, which were to discuss the preparatory work for the representative conference, all other meetings were to discuss and handle major proposals and other major issues from the people's representatives and the masses. The first meeting mainly solved the issues of migrant living and winter production; the third meeting discussed the sentencing of three murderers; the fourth meeting was for the election of candidates to attend the Provincial People's Representative Conference; the sixth meeting discussed tax reduction for disaster areas; the eighth meeting studied additional local grain quotas; the ninth meeting discussed army expansion; and the eleventh meeting discussed the implementation of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In particular, the third and eleventh meetings had the greatest impact on the masses. Before the third meeting, the masses generally expressed dissatisfaction with the light sentences given to counter-revolutionary criminals. They said, "When bad people kill, they are only sentenced to a few years in prison; good people cannot live!" After discussion, it was recommended that the government severely punish them. After approval by the higher court, the death penalty was changed, and the masses were satisfied. The eleventh meeting was held because the resident Standing Committee members learned that some people had doubts about the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and discovered instances of panic and flight. In order to publicize the policy and stabilize the emotions of some of the masses, an enlarged Standing Committee meeting was convened on April 26. Twenty-five Standing Committee members attended, along with 32 representatives from all walks of life and 9 representatives from government agencies, totaling 66 people. In addition to explaining the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, women representative Chen Wanmei also accused the counter-revolutionary elements. The representatives present were focused and enthusiastic in their speeches, strengthening their hatred of the enemy and dispelling their ideological concerns. This enlarged Standing Committee meeting was successful. The previous ten Standing Committee meetings were initiated by the county magistrate, while this one was proposed by the Standing Committee, which is also a manifestation of the county's further promotion of democracy in leadership.

The Standing Committee generally takes the convening of each representative conference seriously and responsibly. Three or four days before the meeting, the resident Standing Committee members would notify the Standing Committee members living in the countryside to gather in the county to study and revise the draft resolutions of the conference, discuss the entire content of the meeting, and actively participate in the preparatory work of the meeting. During the meeting, the Standing Committee members took turns presiding over the meeting and participated in group discussions to inspire the representatives to speak. Before the closing of the meeting, the Standing Committee members conducted a summary, which gradually improved the working ability of the Standing Committee, established the prestige of the Standing Committee, and also increased the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the Standing Committee members. For example, before the recent sixth People's Representative Conference of all circles, the Standing Committee conducted a serious discussion of the government's original draft of the county-wide production self-rescue plan and put forward many amendments. For example, the original plan was to develop sideline production and cooperate with the masses in digging wells, requiring the masses to burn a large number of bricks. The Standing Committee pointed out that the masses did not use bricks to dig wells, but used stone masonry. Using bricks was not only uneconomical, but also not as strong as stone. If the masses were mobilized to burn bricks, they would not be able to sell them, and as a result, they would become detached from the masses. The Standing Committee members also criticized the government's original plan for the generalized distribution of production tasks to each district, and everyone specifically introduced the actual conditions of each district to the government, suggesting that the government focus on the key points according to the specific conditions of each district. The government accepted this suggestion and corrected the original plan. In the group discussions, the Standing Committee members became the core of the representatives of each district, grasped the ideological situation of the representatives, and resolved them in a timely manner. The preparatory work for this meeting was also led by the Standing Committee and carried out by cadres assigned by the government. Because the Standing Committee played a role in the county's People's Representative Conference of all circles, the county magistrate also felt that "the representative conference was opened very easily."

The resident Standing Committee members often go to the countryside and, in conjunction with the central work, carry out publicity and mobilization work to the masses. They listened to the correct reflections of the representatives and the masses, immediately reflected them to the government, and made suggestions. Two resident committee members went to the countryside three times each from March to July of this year, each time for a minimum of seven days and a maximum of one month. Resident Committee Member Jing Rui helped the Eighth District handle more than 4,000 mu of land left over by the troops in half a month. The current resident committee members have a very high prestige among some of the masses, and the masses listen to them.

The Standing Committee also maintains close contact with the resident Standing Committee members in the countryside. From January to May of this year, they received 125 letters from Standing Committee members and representatives that could be verified. Among them, letters from Standing Committee members residing in the countryside accounted for a larger proportion, accounting for 85%, while letters from representatives and other aspects accounted for 15%. In addition to reflecting the opinions and problems of the masses, most of these letters reflected the working conditions in the village. The Standing Committee promptly dealt with these letters separately. If it was a work report, it was submitted to the relevant department for reference; for the opinions and problems of the masses, they directly discussed them with the relevant department, and generally replied to the letters promptly. Over the past six months, the problems and opinions reflected by the resident Standing Committee members and representatives have been proven to be largely correct. The government has also dealt with them more quickly. This has not only gradually established the consciousness of the Standing Committee members and representatives as masters of their own affairs, but also played a great role in assisting the government in improving and promoting the work of the entire county. The section chiefs and other cadres of the county government said, "The Standing Committee knows the situation faster than the government, and with the Standing Committee, we cannot make big mistakes."

In addition, due to the establishment of the resident office, especially after the establishment of a full-time secretary, work such as work logs, meeting minutes, and letter registration has gradually become regularized.

Why is the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference of all circles in Xuanhua County able to carry out its work so well? In addition to the fact that the Standing Committee itself has initially had a sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs and actively played its role, another important reason is that the county's leading cadres attach importance to the work of the Standing Committee. This is mainly reflected in: (1) Respecting the opinions and suggestions reflected by the Standing Committee members and representatives. The county magistrate once told the responsible cadres of his subordinate departments: "The opinions reflected by the representatives and Standing Committee members should be resolved as soon as possible, promptly communicated to the Standing Committee, and replied to the original proposer." In the past six months, more than ten major proposals have been proposed and resolved by the representatives and Standing Committee members through the Standing Committee. Especially during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the leadership accurately grasped the policy based on the materials reflected by the Standing Committee members and representatives. For example, Chen Wanmei reflected at the eleventh enlarged Standing Committee meeting: "If Jia Rong (note: this is a counter-revolutionary element) is not killed, the masses suspect that the county magistrate has benefited from him." Zhang Ji, a Standing Committee member from the Fifth District, reflected: "Huo Gui, who is being detained, is implicated by his brother-in-law (bandit)." Tian Yu, a Standing Committee member from the Ninth District, reflected that there were deviations in the distribution of preferential treatment grain for military families, as well as the corrupt, wasteful, and abusive work style of village cadres, which were all reasonably resolved. In this way, the leadership actively supports the correct suggestions of the Standing Committee and handles them as soon as possible, which further establishes the prestige of the Standing Committee members among the masses and their sense of responsibility. (2) Respecting the political status of the Standing Committee members and paying attention to their cultivation and improvement. After the establishment of the resident office of the Standing Committee in March 1951, the resident committee members were invited to participate in the county government's weekly routine meetings and county affairs meetings, so that they could understand the government's work and solicit opinions. The relationship between the county's leading cadres and the resident Standing Committee members is very close. Resident Committee Member Jing Rui reflected: "When the county magistrate talks to us, he always humbly consults with us about our work." Due to the respect of the leadership, all departments also unite well with the resident committee members. The resident Standing Committee members participate in the county government's cadre study every day and discuss together, thus gradually improving their policy and ideological level. Although there are also individual cadres, such as the Fifth District Chief, who not only did not humbly accept the problems correctly reflected by Representative Zhang Ji on behalf of the masses, but said, "You are the mouthpiece of the masses." However, once such individual phenomena are discovered, they arouse the attention of the county's leading cadres and are quickly corrected (the district chief has already conducted a review).

Although the work of the Standing Committee of Xuanhua County has achieved the above results, there are still some problems:

First of all, from the perspective of each member of the Standing Committee, the composition of the Standing Committee cannot fully reflect the broadness of the united front. Among the 29 Standing Committee members, there are 20 former or current county- and village-level cadres. Therefore, most of the Standing Committee members are cadres and activists. These cadres and activists are indeed supported by the masses, and there is no doubt that they represent the interests of the broad masses of the people. However, in order to unite people from all walks of life more widely, to listen to the voices and opinions of people from all walks of life in a timely manner, and to better carry out the united front work in rural areas, the composition of the Standing Committee should be appropriately adjusted. At present, some leading cadres in Xuanhua County have a vague understanding of this point. Some even regard the Communist Party members in the Standing Committee as "middle-of-the-roaders," which is wrong.

Second, the direct relationship between the Standing Committee and the people's representatives of all circles in the county is not close enough, that is to say, there is still some disconnection. After the vast majority of county representatives finish their representative meetings and return to their villages, they rarely contact the Standing Committee. Many county representatives do not have a deep mass base in the villages. Most representatives often do not bring proposals from the masses when they come to the county for meetings, because their contact with the masses is still very weak. Some proposals are problems that the representatives themselves think of temporarily. Of course, some of them are indeed raised by the representatives on behalf of certain masses because they know some of the hardships or demands of some of the masses. But these proposals are very incomplete. The masses are not very concerned about the results of their meetings. Because the representatives do not have a mass base, some representatives also seem to lack motivation, so that the representatives do not play a role. This is worth noting. As for the saying "going to the county to attend representative meetings is to receive tasks from higher levels, and returning to the village is to convey tasks to the masses," this is quite common.

The production of some representatives is not through mass elections, but mostly designated by the district or appointed by village cadres. There are also many cases of representatives rotating shifts and replacing each other. Due to these reasons, the connection between the county's People's Representative Conference and its Standing Committee and the people of all walks of life is subject to some undue restrictions. Therefore, when resident committee members go to the countryside to contact representatives, they mostly have to be convened by the village government on their behalf. This shows that their direct contact with the masses is not enough. Before each representative conference, the Standing Committee did not pay attention to collecting the major problems that the masses are currently urgently demanding to solve, integrating them into proposals, and preparing them to be included in the agenda of the conference. This situation can also illustrate that the Standing Committee's contact with the masses is very insufficient.

Third, the Standing Committee did not participate in the election of people's representatives. The rights of many county people's representatives have not been properly protected. Since the first People's Representative Conference of all circles in the county was held in December 1949, after an election was conducted, the district people's government has been responsible for adjusting it several times. Until the recently convened sixth representative conference, a very chaotic situation occurred. The original stipulation was that each district should have a total of 180 representatives, but in fact there were 200 representatives present, which was 20 more. The meeting stipulated that representatives should wear red ribbons; attendees should wear yellow ribbons. In reality, however, it was very chaotic. Some representatives who should have attended were not allowed to attend, and some attendees instead obtained the right to attend as representatives. The phenomenon of representative rotation and replacement has also occurred in previous meetings, and the Standing Committee did not dare to suggest correcting these chaotic phenomena, which is wrong.

In short, the achievements of the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference of Xuanhua County are the main ones. The leading cadres of the county are determined to improve their work and overcome their shortcomings. They will definitely be able to improve the work of the Standing Committee even better.

    一定要有健全的常务委员会
    ——介绍察哈尔省宣化县人民代表会议的常务委员会
    伊俊峰
    察哈尔省宣化县各界人民代表会议常务委员会，是在一九四九年十二月的第一次代表会议上产生的。一年来常委会做了许多工作，获得相当成绩，成为县人民代表会议制度的建设中的一个有力的杠杆。该县常务委员会最初有常委二十五人。一年来经过六次代表会议的逐次改选与增补，现有常委二十九人（其中主席一人即该县县长；副主席二人，一为中共宣化县委书记，一为农民代表）。二十九名常委中计有县级机关、团体干部七人，农民代表十六人，文教界代表二人，医务界代表一人，工商界代表一人，特邀代表二人。今年三月根据第五次人民代表会议的决议，建立了常务委员会驻会机构，起先选定了常委二人驻会，后来因工作需要，又增加驻会常委为四人。
    常委会已初步形成了会议制度。截至目前为止共召开过十二次会议。除第二、五、七、十、十二次会议，是为了讨论代表会议的准备工作外，其他各次会议都是讨论和处理人民代表和群众的重大建议案及其他重大问题。第一次会主要解决了移民生活及冬季生产；第三次会讨论了三个杀人犯案件的处刑问题；第四次会为了产生出席省各界人民代表会议的人选；第六次会讨论灾区减征公粮；第八次会研究追加地方粮；第九次会讨论扩军；第十一次会是讨论贯彻执行镇压反革命的政策。特别是第三次和第十一次会对群众影响最大。在第三次会议之前，群众普遍对于反革命凶犯处刑太轻，表示不满。他们说：“坏人杀了人，才判几年徒刑，好人活不成了！”经过讨论后，建议政府严加法办，后经上级法院批准，改判了死刑，群众才感到满意。第十一次会是驻会常委了解到有些群众对镇压反革命政策发生怀疑，并发现了恐慌逃跑的事情。为了宣传政策，稳定部分群众的情绪，于四月二十六日召开了扩大常委会。出席常委二十五名，邀请了各界人民代表三十二名，政府机关代表列席九名，共六十六名。会议上除讲解镇压反革命的政策以外，并由妇女代表陈万美对反革命分子进行控诉。与会代表精神集中，发言热烈，加强了对敌人的仇恨，解除了思想顾虑。这次扩大常委会是成功的。以前十次常委会的召开，由县长主动提出，而此次由常委提出，这也是该县在领导上进一步发扬民主的表现。
    常委会对各次代表会议的召开一般地是认真负责的。会前三、四天即由驻会常委通知住在乡下的常委集中到县，研究与修订大会决议草案，商讨会议的全部内容，并积极参加会议的筹备工作。在会议进行中，由常委轮流主持会议，并分别参加小组讨论，启发代表发言。闭会前由常委进行总结，这样逐步提高了常委的工作能力，建立了常委的威信，也使常委提高了积极性和责任心。如最近召开的第六次各界人民代表会议召开前，常委曾对政府原拟的全县生产自救计划草案进行了认真的讨论，提出不少修改意见。如原计划为发展副业及配合群众打井要群众大量烧砖，常委指出群众打井都不用砖是用石砌，用砖既不经济，又不如石头坚固，若发动起群众烧了砖也卖不出去，结果会脱离群众。常委们同时批评了政府原计划上分配各区生产任务的一般化，大家向政府具体介绍了各区实际情况，建议政府根据各区具体条件抓住重点去布置。政府接受了这个建议，改正了原来的计划。在小组讨论中，常委都成为各区代表的核心，掌握了代表的思想情况及时予以解决。这次会议的筹备工作也是由常委领导，由政府配备干部进行的。由于常委会在县各界人民代表会议中起了作用，因而使县长也感到“代表会开的很省劲”。
    驻会常委经常下乡，结合中心工作，向群众进行宣传和动员工作。他们听到了代表及群众正确的反映，立即向政府反映并提出建议。有两个驻会委员，从今年三月到七月各下乡三次，每次少则七天多则一月。驻会委员景瑞先生在半月内帮助八区处理了部队遗留土地四千多亩。现驻会委员在一部分群众中威信很高，群众都听他们的话。
    常委会与住乡常委的联系也很密切。自今年一月到五月间他们收到常委及代表来信有据可查者有一百二十五件。其中住乡常委来信较多，占百分之八十五，代表及其他方面的来信占百分之十五。这些来信，除反映群众意见及问题以外，大部是反映村中工作情况的。常委会接到这些来信，都迅速分别加以处理。如果是工作报告就交有关部门参考，对于群众意见和问题，就直接向有关部门商议，一般地做到了迅速答复来信。半年来，住乡常委和代表所反映的问题和意见，已经事实证明绝大部分是正确的。政府在处理上也较迅速。这样不仅逐渐树立了常委和代表主人翁的自觉，并且在协助政府改进与推动全县工作上起了很大作用。县政府的科长等干部都说：“常委会了解的情况比政府还快，有了常委会便犯不了大错误了。”
    此外，由于驻会机构的建立，特别是设了专职秘书后，工作日志、会议记录、来信登记等工作，也逐渐步入正轨。
    宣化县的各界人民代表会议常务委员会，为什么能够较好地开展工作呢？这除了常委本身已初步具有了主人翁的责任感，积极发挥了自己的作用以外，另一重要原因即是县的领导干部重视常委会的工作。这主要表现在：（一）尊重常委和代表们反映的意见和建议。县长曾对所属各部门的负责干部讲：“代表及常委们反映的意见要尽先解决，迅速转告常委会，答复原提案人。”半年来代表及常委通过常委会提出并解决了的建议案，主要的有十余件。特别是在镇压反革命期间，领导上根据常委和代表反映的材料，准确地掌握了政策。如陈万美在第十一次扩大常委会上反映：“不杀贾荣（按：这是一个反革命分子），群众怀疑是县长受了他的好处。”五区常委张吉反映：“扣押中的霍贵是受他姐夫（土匪）的牵连。”九区常委田玉反映发放优军粮有偏差，及村干部贪污浪费打骂作风等问题，都得到了合理解决。这样领导上积极支持常委的正确建议并尽先处理，就更加树立了常委们在群众中的威信和他们的责任心。（二）尊重常委们的政治地位，并注意加以培养与提高。一九五一年三月设立常委驻会机构以后，每星期的县府例会及每次县务会议，都邀请驻会委员参加，使他们明了政府工作情况，并征询意见。县的领导干部与驻会常委的关系十分密切。驻会委员景瑞反映：“县长和我们谈话时，总是虚心地跟我们商量工作。”由于领导的尊重，各部门与驻会委员团结的也很好。驻会常委每天参加县府的干部学习，共同讨论，因而逐渐提高了政策思想水平。虽然也有个别干部，如五区区长对常委张吉代表群众正确反映的问题，不但不虚心接受，反说“你是群众搬来的门子”。但这种个别现象，一经发现，就引起了县领导干部的注意，迅速予以纠正（该区区长并已进行了检讨）。
    宣化县常委会工作，虽然有了以上的成绩，但也还存在着一些问题：
    首先从常委各个成员来看，常委会人员配备还不能充分表现统一战线的广泛性。常委二十九人中即有原任或现任的县、村级干部二十人。因此，常委会成员大部是一些干部积极分子。这些干部积极分子，也的确为群众所拥护，毫无疑问的他们是代表着广大人民利益的。但为了更广泛地团结各阶层人民、及时地听取各阶层人民的呼声和意见，更好地去开展农村统一战线工作起见，常委的成员还应该作适当的调整。目前宣化县有些领导干部在这一点的认识上是模糊的。甚至有的把常委中的共产党员也看成是“中间分子”，这是不对的。
    第二，常委会和县的各界人民代表的直接关系还不够密切，也就是说，还有某种脱节的现象。绝大部分的县代表开完代表会，回到村里之后，与常委就很少联系。县代表不少在村中没有深厚的群众基础。大部分代表到县里开会往往没有带来群众的提案，就因为他们跟群众的联系还很薄弱。有些提案，是代表们自己临时想的问题。当然，其中的确也有一些由于代表深知一部分群众的一些疾苦或要求，他提出来是代表一定群众意见的。但这些提案却是很不完备的。他们开会有什么结果，群众也不很关心。因为代表没有群众基础，有一些代表也显得没有劲头，以致代表不起作用。这是值得注意的。至于“到县开代表会就是向上级领任务，回村就是向群众传达任务”这种说法是相当普遍的。
    一部分代表的产生，不是经过群众的选举，多半是由区里指定和村干部委派的。代表轮流换班、顶替充数等也很多。由于这些原因，就造成了县人民代表会议及其所产生的常务委员会和各阶层人民群众的联系受到某种不应有的限制。因此，驻会委员要下乡联系代表，多半也不能不通过村政府代为召集。这就说明他们和群众直接联系是不够的。常委会在历次代表会议之前，没有注意搜集群众中当前迫切要求解决的重大问题，集成提案，准备列入大会
    议程。这种情况同样可以说明常委会和群众联系是十分不够的。
    第三，常委会对于人民代表的选举工作没有参与。不少县人民代表的权利没有受到应有的保障。该县人民代表自一九四九年十二月召开第一次各界人民代表会议时，曾进行了一次选举之后，几次都是由区人民政府负责调整的。直至最近召开的第六次代表会议中出现了十分混乱的状态。原来规定各区应出席的代表共有一百八十名，实际上却有二百名出席，多了二十名。会上规定代表佩带红条；列席人员佩带黄条。实际上却很混乱。有些该出席的代表却不得出席，有的列席人员反而取得了出席代表的权利。以前几次会议中代表的轮换、顶替现象也都曾发生过，常委会对于这些混乱现象没有大胆建议纠正，是不对的。
    总之，宣化县人民代表会议的常务委员会的成绩是主要的，该县领导干部都有决心改进工作，克服缺点，他们一定能够把常委会工作改进得更好。
