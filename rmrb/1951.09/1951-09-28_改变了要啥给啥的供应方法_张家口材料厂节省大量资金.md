Changing the Supply Method of "Giving Whatever Is Asked For"
Zhangjiakou Materials Factory Saves Significant Funds

    The Zhangjiakou Materials Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau has improved its material supply methods, saving the state 20.6 billion yuan in working capital. The factory is responsible for supplying materials to fourteen major units along the Jingbao and Beitongpu lines, including vehicle, machine, electrical, and construction factories (smaller units are not included). These units are distributed along a 900-kilometer line. Therefore, ensuring timely and accurate supply is indeed a heavy task. In the past, the factory simply compiled the plans submitted by the various material-using units and issued materials according to the orders. This method of "giving whatever is asked for," without regard to the appropriateness of the plans, led to the accumulation of a large amount of dead stock. According to statistics, dead and waste materials often accounted for about 60 percent of the stored materials, and the amount of working capital tied up often exceeded 11.4 billion yuan. The total amount of material usage planned by various units in the third quarter was 33 billion yuan, and the supply for July and August was to reach 50 percent of the total plan. In addition to the 2.4 billion yuan supplied in July, 14.1 billion yuan should have been supplied in August. However, as of August 28, the various units had only received 5.6 billion yuan, leaving 8.5 billion yuan worth of materials unclaimed. The Zhangjiakou Construction Section's planned needs were 12,700 bags of cement, 83,800 kilograms of hemp fiber, and 12,500 mortise locks. However, the section did not have many large projects, so why did it need these things? How many doors needed more than 10,000 locks? The Zhangjiakou Materials Factory reviewed the construction section's plan and found that the section did not need 80 percent of the materials. Therefore, it helped the section change its plan, reducing the cement requirement to 400 bags, hemp fiber to 8,500 kilograms, and mortise locks to 1,000. The factory's Party, administrative, and trade union groups studied this situation and decided to change the working method by sending personnel to understand the actual needs of each material-using unit and help them revise their material usage plans, so that materials could be issued according to actual needs. Through four days of efforts (from August 22 to August 26), the material usage plans of various units in Datong, Guisui, and Daiyue areas were revised, reducing them by about two-thirds compared to the original plan of 30 billion yuan. In this way, the plans of various material-using units were reduced by a total of 20.6 billion yuan, reducing a large amount of waste for the state. (Liu Lin)

    改变了要啥给啥的供应方法
    张家口材料厂节省大量资金
    天津铁路局张家口材料厂，改进了材料供应方法，给国家节省了二百零六亿元的流动资金。该厂负责供应京包线、北同蒲沿线车机工电厂等十四个大单位的材料（小单位不在其内）。这些单位分布在九百公里长的一条线上。因此，要做到供应及时，计划准确，的确是一件很繁重的工作。过去该厂只是根据各用料单位提出的计划加以汇编，购了材料就按单发给。这种要啥给啥、不管计划是否得当的工作方法，造成大批呆料积存的现象。据统计，厂内呆废料常占存料百分之六十左右，积压流动资金常常超过一百一十四亿多元。第三季度各单位用料计划的总数是三百三十亿元，七、八两月份的供应要达到总计划的百分之五十。除七月已供应了二十四亿元外，八月份应供给一百四十一亿元。但截至八月二十八日止，各单位只领出五十六亿元，尚有八十五亿元的材料没有领。张家口建筑段的计划需要是洋灰一万二千七百袋，麻刀八万三千八百公斤，暗门锁一万二千五百个。但该段并无多少大工程，为什么要这些东西？有多少个门需用一万多个锁呢？张家口材料厂审查了建筑段这个计划，发现该段有百分之八十的材料是不需要的。于是帮助该段改变计划，把洋灰需要量改成四百袋，麻刀改为八千五百公斤，暗门锁改至一千个，事情也都办了。该厂党、行政、工会小组研究了这种情况，决定改变工作方法，派员分头下去，了解各用料单位的实际需要情况，帮助他们修改用料计划，以便按照实际需要发给材料。经四天来的努力（从八月二十二日到二十六日），修订了大同、归绥、岱岳等地区各单位的用料计划，计比原计划三百亿减少了三分之二左右。这样，使各用料单位的计划共减少了二百○六亿，给国家减少了大批浪费。  （柳林）
