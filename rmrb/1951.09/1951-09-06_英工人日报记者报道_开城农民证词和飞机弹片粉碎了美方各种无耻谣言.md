    British "Daily Worker" Reporter's Report
    Testimony of Kaesong Farmers and Aircraft Shrapnel Shatter Various Shameless Rumors of the U.S. Side
    [Xinhua News Agency, September 4th] Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker" in London, reported from Kaesong on the 1st: The irrefutable testimony given by Kaesong farmers today proves that the United States committed a second attempt to assassinate General Nam Il at 00:30 today (the 1st). The U.S. liaison officer, Air Force Colonel Kinney, insisted that the explosion was caused by bombs or shells buried underground, but he finally had to admit that the bombs were dropped from airplanes. Kinney was driven to a dead end by the evidence of bomb craters, shrapnel, and the testimony of farmers who were almost killed, so he requested a suspension of the investigation. At the end of the investigation, he suddenly announced: Right at the time of the air raid, a U.S. radar reconnaissance station discovered an unidentified aircraft. He then suddenly accused that the air raid was carried out by the Chinese and Korean side's aircraft. He said that the U.S. side did not know that Nam Il's residence had been moved, attempting to use this to prove his fabricated and worthless lies. But reconnaissance planes fly over this area day and night, even using parachute flares, and this is not without reason. At the bombing site, Kinney used all kinds of vulgar means of a rogue lawyer, so that the Korean liaison officer, Colonel Zhang, had to sternly point out: This behavior is unworthy of a soldier's identity.
    The U.S. side's statement about the bombing incident is truly full of loopholes. The radar's reconnaissance distance is at least seventy miles. Would the U.S. side allow enemy aircraft to get so close without sending night fighters to intercept them? Did they know that this aircraft only went to Kaesong? On the morning of September 1st, thousands of people heard planes flying over Kaesong nine times. These planes made the same sound, flew on the same route, and one plane dropped two five-hundred-pound bombs near General Nam Il's residence. How is this to be explained? How could Kinney "forget" that the radar had detected an unidentified aircraft, only to remember it at the end of the investigation?
    The evidence against the U.S. side is very conclusive. When we stood looking at the destroyed rice paddies and talking to the simple and honest farmers, I heard Colonel Zhang say in a stern voice: "You told us that you have dropped more bombs than you have hairs on your head. Then please tell us, are these bomb craters?" Kinney saw that everything was over. So he fabricated the radar story and hurried back to order the dropping of flares over the reporter's camp in Munsan to whitewash his childish and ridiculous story.
    Now, who can believe any denial from the U.S. side? On the evening of August 29th, I personally saw the flares dropped here. On August 30th, I saw the uniforms of the troops (referring to the South Korean troops who attacked the neutral zone on that day), and saw them retreat into the U.S. military positions without being fired upon. Let Kinney bring some people, and even some reporters if he wants, to live in Kaesong, and be present when these events happen. The truth is finally revealed, and the whole world can see that the U.S. is using the United Nations as a guise to achieve their own imperialist goals; when they fail to achieve these goals, they want to use guns and bombs to disrupt the negotiations, and even destroy that glimmer of hope for peace that only China and Korea are trying to maintain.

    英工人日报记者报道
    开城农民证词和飞机弹片粉碎了美方各种无耻谣言
    【新华社四日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿一日自开城报道：今天开城农民说出的无可辩驳的证言，证明了美国在今天（一日）零时三十分犯了第二次企图谋杀南日将军的罪行。美方联络官空军上校肯尼一口咬定爆炸是埋在地下的炸弹或炮弹造成的，但他最后不得不承认这些炸弹是飞机上投下来的。肯尼被炸弹坑、弹片这些证据和险些被炸死的农民的证词逼得走头无路，于是就要求暂停调查。在调查的末了，他突然宣布：正好在这次空袭的时间，美方的雷达侦察站发现一架未经辨别的飞机。他并突然指责说，这证明这次空袭是朝中方面的飞机所进行的。他说美方没有人知道南日的住所已经迁移，企图借此证明他所捏造的不值一驳的谎言。但是侦察机不分昼夜飞到这个地区上空，甚至使用降落伞照明弹，这并不是无缘无故的。在被轰炸的地点，肯尼耍尽了流氓律师的种种下流手段，使得朝鲜方面的联络官张上校不得不严峻地指出：这种行为不配军人的身份。
    美方关于轰炸事件的说法真是漏洞百出。雷达的侦察距离至少达七十哩。难道美方会让敌方飞机一直逼近而不派夜间战斗机去截击吗？他们知道这架飞机只到开城去吗？九月一日晨，成千的人听到飞机九次飞过开城上空，这些飞机发出的是同样的声音，按同一路线飞行，有一架飞机在南日将军住所附近投下两枚五百磅重的炸弹，这件事怎样解释呢？肯尼怎么会“忘记”雷达曾侦察到一架未经辨别的飞机这件事，直到调查结束时才想起来呢？
    不利于美方的证据是十分确凿的。当我们站着看被炸毁了的谷田，和纯朴老实的农民谈话时，我听到张上校带着严厉的声音说：“你对我们说，你投过的炸弹比你头上的头发还多。那末请告诉我们，这是不是炸弹坑？”肯尼眼看一切都完蛋了。于是他就捏造了雷达的故事并赶快回去下令在汶山记者行营上空投照明弹，来为他的幼稚可笑的故事粉饰。
    现在谁能相信美方的任何否认呢？我在八月二十九日晚间亲眼看到投在这里的照明弹。我在八月三十日看到军队（按指该日袭击中立区的南朝鲜部队）的制服，看到他们退入美军阵地时没有受到射击。让肯尼带一些人、而且如果他愿意的话还带一些记者到开城来住，并且在这些事件发生的时候恰好在场试试看。真相终于大白了，全世界都可以看到，美方在利用联合国做幌子，以达到他们自己的帝国主义的目的；当他们没有达到这种目的时，他们就想用枪弹和炸弹把谈判打掉，连那只有中国和朝鲜在设法维持的一丝和平的希望也打掉。
