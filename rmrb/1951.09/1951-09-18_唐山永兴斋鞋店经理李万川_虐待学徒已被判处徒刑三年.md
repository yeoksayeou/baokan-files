    Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment for Abusing Apprentice

    To the Editors:
    The incident of Li Wanchuan, manager of the Yongxingzhai Shoe Store in Linxi, Tangshan, abusing apprentice Shi Yongcun, was published in your newspaper's "Readers' Letters" column on August 22nd. The local authorities have taken this matter very seriously and have sent Li Wanchuan to the Municipal People's Court for handling. Based on the facts of Li Wanchuan's crime, the Municipal People's Court has sentenced him to three years of imprisonment according to the law. Shi Yongcun worked in the store for two years and only received 20,000 yuan in wages and two and a half sets of old cotton and lined clothing. The wages he lost due to Li Wanchuan's illegal exploitation should be compensated by Li Wanchuan through mutual agreement. Li Wanchuan's wife, Shi, assisted in the abuse and should be given strict criticism and education.
