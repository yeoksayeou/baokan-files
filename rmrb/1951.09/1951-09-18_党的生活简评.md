    The CPC Sunan District Committee Inspects the Implementation of the Patriotic Pacts

    The recent inspection by the CPC Sunan District Committee of the implementation of patriotic pacts shows that urban masses in the district have generally established such pacts. According to statistics from Zhenjiang City, over 80% of factories and enterprises, 90% of schools, and 80% of residents have revised their patriotic pacts. The development of the movement in rural areas is weaker and more uneven than in urban areas. In counties where leading organs have exercised tighter control, such as Changshu, Shanghai, and Kunshan, 50% to 80% of villages have established patriotic pacts, while in other counties, only a small portion of villages have done so. According to the inspection results, the patriotic pacts established in various parts of Sunan can be roughly divided into three types: The first type involves widespread and in-depth patriotic education, where pacts are formulated through full democratic discussions based on increased awareness among the masses and are practical and feasible. These pacts are checked regularly after their establishment. Although few in number, these patriotic pacts have played a significant role in mobilizing and organizing the masses to implement various tasks. The second type involves general patriotic education, which is not widespread or in-depth, and discussions among the masses are not thorough. The content of the pacts lacks practical connection with people's lives. These patriotic pacts have played a temporary role during the high tide of the patriotic movement and had some influence among the masses, but generally failed to develop continuously and deeply. Some of them have become nominal. This situation is relatively common and should be the focus of today's inspection and improvement. The third type of patriotic pact is entirely formulated by a small number of cadres or activists in a paternalistic manner. There is no publicity beforehand or education afterward, and there are even forced establishments. As a result, the pacts have no effect among the masses, and in some places, they have even aroused resentment. Although this serious situation is rare, it should be given special attention and vigilance.

    Based on the situation in Sunan District and other regions, Party leading organs should consciously summarize and promote the experience of the first type of areas in establishing and implementing patriotic pacts, commend good examples to improve the general situation, and further leverage the practical role of these areas' patriotic pacts in promoting people's participation in national defense construction, production, and various tasks, creating various mature experiences in deepening the patriotic pact movement. The second type of patriotic pact is the focus of current inspection, revision, and supplementation. Systematic anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic education should be carried out in a planned manner, starting from the practical experience and immediate interests of the people's struggle, consciously raising the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, and relying on the masses' conscious and voluntary participation in the revision and supplementation of patriotic pacts, gradually changing the phenomenon of some patriotic pacts being nominal. Where education on patriotic pacts for the masses is insufficient, a patriotic pact education class should be added. If the content of the pacts is empty, specific struggle demands of the masses should be added to the pacts. Leading organs should, through the efforts of representative meetings, propagandists, and the vast number of cadres, solidify patriotic pacts in the lives of the masses, making them a driving force for the Party to lead the broad masses in continuing to strengthen the struggle against American aggression and aid Korea and to carry out national defense construction. In areas with the third type of patriotic pacts, deviations should be resolutely corrected to eliminate the adverse effects already created among the masses. To this end, cadres and the masses should be educated to correctly understand the political significance of launching the patriotic pact movement, and good examples of promoting patriotic pacts should be created in these backward areas in order to set an example and promote the movement forward step by step.

    苏南区党委检查爱国公约的执行状况
    中共苏南区党委最近检查爱国公约执行的结果，说明该区城市一般群众已相当普遍地订立了爱国公约。据镇江市统计，工厂企业部门修订爱国公约占百分之八十以上，学校占百分之九十，居民占百分之八十。农村中运动的发展较城市为差，而且不平衡，其中领导机关掌握较紧者如常熟、上海、崐山等县，已有百分之五十至百分之八十乡村订立了爱国公约，一般县份只有一小部分乡村订立了公约。根据检查的结果，苏南各地订立的爱国公约大致可分三种类型：第一种类型是进行了普遍深入的爱国主义教育，在群众认识提高的基础上充分进行了民主讨论并订出切实可行的公约，订了以后又按时进行检查，这种爱国公约为数不多，但在动员群众组织群众贯彻执行各项工作方面、已经发挥了巨大作用。第二种类型是进行了一般的爱国主义教育，但不普遍不深入，在群众中讨论得也不充分，公约内容同人民生活缺乏实际的联系。这种爱国公约在爱国运动高潮中均曾起了一时的作用，在群众中有过一些影响，但一般的均未能持续地深入地向前发展，其中有一部分已经有名无实。这种情况比较普遍地存在着，因而也应当是今天检查和改进的重点。第三种爱国公约是完全由少数干部或积极分子用包办代替的方式订立的，事前不宣传，事后不教育，甚至有强迫订立的现象；因此，公约在群众中丝毫未起作用，有些地方甚至引起群众的反感，这种严重的情况虽是少数，但应当特别提起注意和警惕。
    根据苏南区和其他各地的情况，目前党的领导机关应当有意识地总结和推广上述第一种类型地区的爱国公约订立和执行的经验，表扬好的典型借以提高一般，更加发挥这些地区的爱国公约在推动人民参加国防建设，生产及各种工作的实际作用，创造深入爱国公约运动的各种成熟的经验。第二种类型的爱国公约是目前检查和修订补订的重点，要有计划地进行系统的抗美援朝爱国教育，从人民斗争的实际经验和切身利益出发，有意识地提高人民群众的政治觉悟和爱国热情，依靠群众的自觉自愿进行修订补订爱国公约的工作，逐步改变某些爱国公约有名无实的现象；对群众爱国公约教育不足的地方，应当补上一次爱国公约教育的课；公约内容空泛的，应当在公约中补进群众的具体斗争要求，领导机关要通过代表会议和宣传员以及广大干部的努力来把爱国公约在群众生活中固定起来，成为党领导广大人民继续加强抗美援朝斗争，进行国防建设的推动力量。有第三种类型的爱国公约的地区应坚决纠正偏向，消除在群众中已造成的不良影响。为此，应该教育干部和群众正确认识开展爱国公约运动的政治意义，并在这些工作落后的地区创造出一个或两个推行爱国公约的好典型，以便树立起榜样，有步骤地推动运动前进。
