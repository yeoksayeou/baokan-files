Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th—The Central People's Government Northeast Flood Disaster慰问团(comfort delegation) has now completed its mission and departed Shenyang for Beijing on the 27th.

The delegation arrived in Shenyang on the 11th of this month and successively visited flood-stricken areas in Kaiyuan, Haicheng, and the suburbs of Shenyang City to express condolences to the disaster victims. They conveyed Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government's deep concern for them and also commended the meritorious troops and government workers in various places who rescued the disaster victims. The delegation also inspected flood control projects on important rivers in Northeast China.

During their stay in Shenyang, the delegation held symposiums with responsible comrades from the Northeast People's Government and the Shenyang Municipal People's Government to discuss future flood prevention and disaster relief issues in Northeast China.

The arrival of the delegation in Northeast China was a great encouragement to the people in the flood-stricken areas of Northeast China. When the disaster victims heard that Vice Premier Dong Biwu had stayed up all night, personally planning disaster relief measures, because of the sudden floods in Northeast China, and that Premier Zhou immediately approved the allocation of 100,000 tons of relief grain after the floods occurred in Northeast China, they were all deeply moved and unanimously expressed their determination and confidence to "rely on production for self-relief and overcome the disaster."

    慰问东北灾民任务完成
    中央慰问团离沈返京
        【新华社沈阳二十八日电】中央人民政府东北水灾慰问团现已完成任务，于二十七日离沈返京。
    慰问团于本月十一日到达沈阳后，即先后到开原、海城及沈阳市郊等地水灾区慰问灾民，向灾民传达毛主席和中央人民政府对他们的深切关怀，同时还嘉奖了各地抢救灾民的有功部队和政府工作人员。慰问团并曾视察东北各重要河流的防洪工程。
    慰问团留住沈阳期间，曾与东北人民政府及沈阳市人民政府负责同志举行座谈会，讨论关于东北今后防水和救灾的问题。
    慰问团的到达东北，对东北水灾区人民是一个极大的鼓励。当灾民听到董必武副总理曾因东北突遭水灾，彻夜不眠，亲自筹划救灾办法，和周总理在东北发生水灾后立刻就批拨了十万吨救济粮食的消息以后，莫不深受感动，一致表示“生产自救，度过灾荒”的决心和信心。
