    Eliminating Speculation and Profiteering in the Construction Industry
    Cheng Hongyi
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government has promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Management of the Construction Industry. The biggest difference between these regulations and the old management regulations is that they not only stipulate the penalties for illegal acts such as shoddy workmanship and the use of substandard materials, but also require that the construction industry have fixed capital, fixed technical personnel, and construction technicians and workers, and that the scope of business be determined according to capital and technical capabilities. Cities such as Harbin and Taiyuan have also successively issued management measures for the construction industry that are generally the same as the above. The greatest benefit of making provisions in these areas is that it can eliminate speculators who have entered the construction industry without capital or technology, and prevent illegal acts by some construction companies such as using substandard materials and subcontracting projects, so as to promote the construction industry to gradually get on the right track. All major cities in the country should formulate management regulations based on their specific conditions and strictly manage the construction industry.

    The current state of the construction industry is very chaotic, and it is very necessary for the People's Government to implement such appropriate management. Civil engineering and construction is an important part of national basic construction. If civil engineering and construction are done poorly, the country's basic construction will suffer serious losses. As factories and mines in various places are vigorously recovering, and municipal construction in some cities has partially begun, the original construction capacity can no longer meet objective needs. Therefore, the construction industry has become one of the most profitable industries. A large number of speculators have taken the opportunity to enter the construction industry to engage in speculation and profiteering, regarding the construction industry as the "no-capital business" that is easiest to obtain windfall profits. Last year, there were only 230 construction companies in Beijing, but this year it has surged to more than 370. Most of the more than 140 newly added construction companies are third-class companies with little capital and weak strength. When applying for registration, even the owners of dim sum shops demanded to open construction companies. In other places, Kuomintang officers from Yan Xishan's bandit gang who had been released in Taiyuan also went to run construction companies. In some places, speculators could carry a briefcase, rent a room, and put up a few sofas to swindle and deceive people everywhere to contract projects. The purpose of these speculators is only to make a fortune from the country's construction undertakings, and they do not intend to engage in any formal construction business. Most of these people have no capital and no technology, and rely on raising bid prices, subcontracting projects, and using substandard materials to seek illegal profits. As for whether the project is done well or not, they do not care. The result of speculators getting rich is that the country's construction undertakings are damaged, and construction workers are subject to layer upon layer of exploitation by contractors and foremen. Only after the People's Government stipulates the capital, technical personnel, and workers of the construction industry can these speculators who have no fixed capital, technical personnel, or workers and who intend to obtain profits empty-handed be unable to exist. The People's Government must strictly ban these speculators who are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Allowing them to exist in a laissez-faire manner is tantamount to allowing the interests of the country and the people to be harmed at will, because these people rely on defrauding the country's wealth, ruining the country's undertakings, and cruelly exploiting workers to fatten themselves.

    For ordinary, legitimate construction companies, the new management regulations protect their legitimate interests and encourage them to develop their enterprises in legitimate ways. Are ordinary construction companies all very sound? We cannot say that yet. Although ordinary construction companies have certain construction capabilities and capital, generally speaking, the existing operating methods are still relatively backward. Most still rely on foremen to rule workers. At the same time, the organizations are not sound enough, there is a lack of fixed technical personnel and workers, and the phenomena of insufficient capital, using substandard materials, and subcontracting projects are still quite common. If these illegal acts are not prohibited, national construction will also suffer serious harm. The new construction industry management regulations in various cities not only stipulate methods for punishing these illegal acts, but also point out the correct path for their development. That is to improve enterprises and improve business management methods. With a certain amount of capital, fixed technical personnel and workers, and contracting projects according to their own grades, construction companies have the conditions to improve business management methods, improve technology, and improve project quality. Construction companies with weaker construction capabilities can also take joint ventures to enrich their construction capabilities. Those who can make achievements in this area can not only accumulate capital and develop their enterprises, but also be commended and rewarded by the government and society. This is the path that all legitimate construction companies should take.

    To implement the new management regulations, the competent authorities must first conduct in-depth ideological education for private construction industry operators. Construction industry operators in Beijing have already raised many opinions on the new management regulations. Some of these opinions are unnecessary concerns, and some are reflections of the wrong thinking of construction industry operators. These opinions must be answered seriously.

    Some people say that if private construction companies fix their capital and hire technical personnel and workers, if they cannot contract projects, won't they be sitting idle and eating into their capital? Some of these concerns come from speculators in the construction industry, whose purpose is to continue their speculative business, which is of course not worth refuting; some legitimate construction companies also have such concerns, which is completely unnecessary. The actual situation today is that there are many projects and it is difficult to find trustworthy construction companies to contract. When the country's large-scale economic construction begins, the construction tasks will be even more arduous. Therefore, the question is whether construction companies can enhance their construction capabilities and treat the contracted projects with a serious and responsible attitude. Construction companies that can truly do this will never have no projects to do. In the future, those who have no projects to do will be those construction companies that do not actively improve their enterprises, because the country's construction cannot allow them to ruin it at will. Legitimate construction companies should not blindly shout along with speculators, otherwise they will only delay their own development opportunities.

    Some are dissatisfied with the government's limitation of their project scope, saying that this restricts their development. These people are actually unwilling to give up the opportunity to obtain illegal profits, because limiting the scope of projects will not reduce the legitimate profits of construction companies. The scope of contracting projects is stipulated according to the construction capabilities of construction companies at all levels. Contracting large projects beyond one's own capabilities will only make it possible to obtain profits by deceiving the clients with illegal means such as subcontracting, and using substandard materials. In this way, although the construction company can defraud some more profits, the project will inevitably suffer damage. The People's Government should not allow such "development" that harms the public for personal gain and harms others for self-interest. Now, the People's Government has pointed out a legitimate development path for construction industry operators, and construction industry operators should follow this direction to develop.

    Some people even say that it is better to deposit the money in the bank and eat interest. This is a statement without investigation and research. In fact, most of the people who say these things are precisely those speculators who have no fixed capital, because real construction companies know that taking formal operating methods will not yield profits smaller than bank interest. These speculators should be clear that if they still intend to treat the construction company as a speculative business to obtain profits without capital, before they stop doing it themselves, the government will ban it. Not long ago, the Xinhua Heji Construction Company, which was ordered to suspend business by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau, was an example.

    Some people are unwilling to directly hire workers, fearing labor-management relations. This idea is wrong. Facts have proved that correct handling of labor-management relations is more beneficial to production than relying on foremen to rule workers.

    To implement the new management regulations and change the chaotic state of the construction industry, ideological education must also be carried out in state-owned construction companies, especially construction companies produced by agencies. The main task of the construction companies produced by agencies is to solve the problem of agency funding. The leading cadres of these construction companies are mostly laymen, and the business work is actually often controlled by some hired construction merchants, so problems often occur. Some construction companies produced by agencies in Beijing have repeatedly had incidents of subcontracting projects and using substandard materials, and even illegal acts of colluding with private merchants to raise project bid prices to deceive the country. The result of doing so is "the big public family suffers losses, the small public family gains profits, and private individuals make a fortune." Therefore, the partial viewpoints must first be corrected within these state-owned construction companies. These construction companies often only consider the interests of their own units. Under the domination of the idea of "making more money for their own agency," they are easily unscrupulous in pursuing profits. These construction companies should well establish an overall concept of being responsible for the country's undertakings and not limit their vision to the partial interests of their own units. These units must also establish the concept of valuing government laws and regulations. They often feel that what they are doing is also a national matter, so they do whatever they want without considering the rules and regulations of the competent authorities. State-owned construction companies should first make achievements in improving organization, improving technology, and improving business management in order to promote the progress of private construction companies and play their due leading role.

    It is currently difficult to move the construction industry from a backward and chaotic state to a regular state. For example, the current wage issue, the allocation and organization of labor, etc., are specific difficulties. However, these difficulties should and can be overcome with the guidance of the competent authorities and the assistance of the trade union. All ideas that emphasize difficulties and are unwilling to improve are wrong.

    肃清营造业中的投机倒把现象
    程宏毅
    北京市人民政府公布了营造业管理暂行条例。这个条例和过去旧的管理条例的最大区别，在于它不但规定了对偷工减料等违法行为的处分办法，并且规定了营造业必须有固定的资金、固定的技术人员和建筑技术工人，根据资金和技术能力划定经营范围。哈尔滨、太原等城市也曾先后颁布了大致与上述内容相同的营造业的管理办法。从这些方面加以规定的最大好处，是可以取缔那些混入营造业的既无资本又无技术的投机商，和某些营造商的偷工减料转包工程等不法行为，以推动营造业逐步走上轨道。全国各大城市都应该根据自己的具体情况，制定管理条例，对营造业进行严格的管理。
    目前营造业的状况十分混乱，人民政府对营造业施行这样适当的管理是十分必要的。土木建筑是国家基本建设的一个重要部分，土木建筑搞坏了，国家的基本建设就将受到严重的损失。由于各地的厂矿企业正在大力恢复，有些都市的市政建设已经部分开始，原有的建筑能力已经不能满足客观需要，因此营造业已成为利润最高的一种事业。大批投机商也就乘机混入营造业进行投机捣把，把营造业看成了最便于获取暴利的“无本生意”。北京市去年只有二百三十家营造厂，今年就激增到三百七十多家。新增加的一百四十多家营造厂，其中大部分是三等厂，资本少实力差。在申请登记时，甚至点心店的掌柜的也要求开营造厂。其他如太原市内被释放的阎锡山匪帮的军官也去经营营造厂。有些地方的投机者挟上一个皮包，租上一间房子，摆上几个沙发就可以到处招摇撞骗承揽工程。这些投机者的目的，只是想从国家的建筑事业中发上一笔横财，并不打算经营什么正规的营造事业。这些人大多是既无资金又无技术，依靠哄抬标价，转包工程，偷工减料等手段图取非法利润。至于工程做的好坏，他们是不管的。投机者发财的结果是国家建设事业受到破坏，建筑工人受包商和把头的层层剥削。只有人民政府对营造业的资金、技术人员和工人加以规定之后，这些既无一定资金又无技术人员和工人的打算空手取利的投机家才能无法存在。人民政府对这种有害于国计民生的投机者，必须严格取缔。放任自流地允许他们存在，就等于允许国家与人民的利益可以任人损害。因为这些人是靠骗取国家财富，败坏国家事业，并残酷地剥削工人来喂肥自己的。
    对于一般的正当的营造厂商，新的管理条例是保护他们的正当利益并鼓励他们以正当的方法发展自己的企业的。是不是一般营造厂都已十分健全了呢？还不能这样说。一般的营造厂虽具有一定的施工能力和资金，但一般说来，现有的经营方式还比较落后，大部分还是依靠把头统治工人，同时机构不够健全，缺少固定的技术人员和工人，加以资金不充足，偷工减料转包工程等现象仍然相当普遍。不禁止这些违法行为，国家建设也要遭受严重的危害。各个城市的新的营造业管理条例，不但规定了处分这些非法行为的办法，并且指给他们以正确的发展途径。那就是健全企业，改善经营管理方法。营造厂有了一定的资金，有了固定的技术人员和工人，同时按自己的等级承包工程，就有条件改善经营管理方法，改进技术，提高工程质量。施工能力较薄弱的营造厂还可以采取联营的办法以充实施工能力，能够在这方面做出成绩的，不但可以积累资金，发展自己的企业，并可受到政府和社会的表扬与奖励。这是一切正当的营造厂应该走的道路。
    要贯彻执行新的管理条例，主管机关必须首先向私营营造业者进行深入的思想教育。北京市的营造业者对于新的管理条例已经提出了不少的意见，这些意见有些是不必要的顾虑，有些是营造业者的错误思想的反映。对于这些意见，必须认真地给以答复。
    有些人说，私营营造厂固定了资金，雇佣了技术人员和工人后，假若包不到工程，岂不要坐吃山空？这种顾虑，有些来自营造业中的投机商，他们的目的是为了想继续自己的投机买卖，这当然不值得一驳；有些正当的营造厂也有这样的顾虑，则是完全不必要的。今天的实际情况是，工程多，找不到可以信托的营造厂承包。当国家大规模的经济建设开始后，建筑的任务将更为繁重。所以问题在于营造厂能不能增强自己的施工能力，并以认真负责的态度对待承包的工程。真正能这样做的营造厂，决不会无工程可做。今后无工程可做的，将是那些不积极健全自己企业的营造厂。因为国家的建设是不能让他们随便败坏的。正当的营造厂商不应该跟着投机家们盲目叫喊，否则只有耽误自己的发展机会。
    有些不满意政府给他们限定工程范围，说这是限制了他们的发展。这些人实际上是不愿放弃非法取利的机会。因为限制工程范围，并不会减低营造厂的正当的利润。承包工程范围是根据各级营造厂的施工能力规定的。超越自己的能力承包大工程，除了以转包转倒，偷工减料等不法手段欺骗委托者外，就不可能获取利润。这样，营造厂虽能多骗取一些利润，但工程必然遭受损害。对于这样损公利私损人利己的“发展”，人民政府是不应当允许的。现在，人民政府已经给营造业者指出了正当的发展前途，营造业者应该遵循这个方向发展。
    有些人甚至说这样还不如把钱存在银行吃利息好些。这是没经过调查研究的说法。说这些话的人实际上大多正是那些没有一定资金的投机者。因为真正的营造厂商会知道，采取正规的经营方法，利润不会小于银行利息。这些投机商应该清楚，假使他们还打算把营造厂当做无本取利的投机买卖，等不到他们自己不干，政府就会加以取缔的。不久以前，被北京市人民政府建设局停止营业的新华合记营造厂就是一个例子。
    有些人不愿直接雇佣工人，怕有劳资关系。这种想法是不对的。事实已经证明，正确的处理劳资关系，比依靠把头统治工人，对生产是更为有利的。
    要贯彻执行新的管理条例，改变营造业的混乱状态，还必须在公营建筑公司，特别是机关生产的建筑公司中进行思想教育。机关生产的建筑公司的主要任务是解决机关经费问题。这些建筑公司的领导干部又大多是外行，业务工作实际上常是掌握在一些聘请来的营造商人手中，因此常常发生问题。北京市有些机关生产的建筑公司，曾经不止一次地发生转包工程，偷工减料的事情，甚至发生和私商联合抬高工程标价欺骗国家的非法行为。这样做的结果是“大公家吃亏，小公家得利，私人发财”。因此，在这些公营建筑公司内，首先必须纠正局部观点。这些建筑公司往往只考虑到本单位的利益，在“多为本机关赚些钱”的思想支配下，就很容易不择手段地追逐利润。这些建筑公司应该很好地树立对国家事业负责的整体观念，不要把目光局限在本单位的局部利益上。这些单位还必须树立重视政府法令的观念。他们常常觉得自己做的也是国家的事情，于是就自己想怎么做就怎么做，而不大考虑主管机关的规章法令。公营建筑公司应该首先在健全组织、提高技术、改善经营管理方面做出成绩，才能推动私营营造业前进，才能对后者起应有的领导作用。
    营造业从落后的混乱状态走上正规，目前是有具体困难的。例如目前的工资问题，劳动力的调拨组织问题等，都是具体的困难。但是，这些困难在主管机关的指导和工会的协助下都是应当克服而且是可以克服的。一切强调困难不愿改进的想法都是错误的。
