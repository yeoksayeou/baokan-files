    Oppose Plagiarism in Feature Writing

    To the Editor:

    I am now exposing a very bad plagiarism practice among correspondents.

    After reading the "Three Great Happy Events in the Mentougou Mining Area" in the Xinmin Daily on August 22nd, and the news and letter "Improvement of the Living Standards of the Laboring People in Mentougou" in the Guangming Daily on August 25th, I discovered that Li Xichang and Zheng Xiuqi had plagiarized them from "Three Great Happy Events in the Jingxi Mining Area" written by Ma Ning in the Beijing Evening News (trial edition) on August 15th. The only differences are slight modifications in a few words and the order of sentences. At the same time, I also asked Comrade Ma Ning, the original author, and according to him, he did not submit this manuscript to the above two newspapers. Therefore, I believe that the attitude of Li Xichang and Zheng Xiuqi is extremely dishonest, and their motive is merely to obtain manuscript fees or show off, and not really for propaganda. Otherwise, they could have cut out the news published in the Beijing Evening News (trial edition) and sent it to the Xinmin Daily and Guangming Daily, suggesting that they reprint it. Why did they have to steal other people's labor results? Obviously, this is a bad plagiarism practice. We must not allow it to continue to spread. For this reason, I hope that Comrades Li Xichang and Zheng Xiuqi will make a public and profound self-criticism in the newspaper.

    Editor's Note: Such plagiarism in feature writing is indeed an extremely bad practice and deserves the vigilance of all correspondents and newspapers. We should all fight to eradicate this bad practice.

### 反对通讯写作中的抄袭作风

    反对通讯写作中的抄袭作风编辑同志：
    我现在向你们揭发通讯员当中一种极恶劣的抄袭作风。
    当我读了八月二十二日新民报“门头沟矿区三大喜事”，与八月二十五日光明日报“门头沟劳动人民生活改善”的新闻和来信后，发现这是李希昌、郑修歧，从八月十五日北京晚报（试版）马宁所写的“京西矿区有三大喜事”中抄袭而来的。二者所不同的，只是在很少的字句上和前后次序上略有修改。同时，我也问了下原作者马宁同志，据谈，他并没有向以上两报投这个稿件。因此，我认为李希昌、郑修歧这种态度是极不老实的，其动机不过是为了骗取稿费，或出出风头，并不是真正为了作宣传。否则，他可以将北京晚报（试版）所刊消息剪下来寄给新民报、光明日报，建议他们转载，为什么偏要盗取别人的劳动成果呢？显然这是一种恶劣的抄袭作风。我们决不能让它继续流传。为此，我希望李希昌、郑修歧同志在报纸上作公开的深刻检讨。

    编者按：通讯写作中这种抄袭的行为，确是极端不良的作风，值得所有通讯员以及各报的警惕。我们大家应该为根绝这种恶劣的作风而斗争。
