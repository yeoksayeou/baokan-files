    Beijing Maternal and Child Health Experimental Institute, some staff members
    Bureaucratic work style should be corrected immediately
    To the Editor:
    The bureaucratic work style of some staff members at the Beijing Maternal and Child Health Experimental Institute is serious, causing dissatisfaction among many people.
    On August 6th, an old woman, leading a four or five-year-old child, came out of the institute and complained to the local police station comrades: "A few days ago, my child had a fever, and I also felt a little unwell. We went to a traditional Chinese medicine shop to buy some medicine and took it. The adult got better, but the child started coughing. I took the child to the Maternal and Child Health Experimental Institute for treatment. The doctor actually said: 'The child was treated at that hospital, go back to that hospital, we don't care here.' I told him that the child had not been treated at any hospital before. The doctor said: 'Then come back when the child is about to die!' What am I supposed to do?!"
    The institute often does not start work on time (8 o'clock) as stipulated. For example, on August 5th, it was 8:30, and the institute still had not started work; people crowded outside waiting to see a doctor, but no one cared. When people asked the staff about registration procedures, they often ignored them. Some rural women were waiting in the waiting room, and when the doctor called out a name and got no response, the doctor scolded harshly: "Do you even know your own name?!"
    I suggest that the institute quickly correct this bureaucratic work style and better serve the people.
                                                              Wang ZheyI, Wen Boping

### 北京妇幼保健实验院某些工作人员  官僚主义作风应即纠正

    北京妇幼保健实验院某些工作人员
    官僚主义作风应即纠正编辑同志：
    北京妇幼保健实验院某些工作人员官僚主义作风严重，引起很多群众的不满。
    八月六日，一个老太太领着她四、五岁的小孩从该院出来，向当地派出所同志诉苦说：“前几天，我的小孩发烧，我也有点不舒服。我们上中药铺买点药吃了，大人好了，孩子咳嗽了。我领着孩子到妇幼保健实验院去治。大夫竟说：‘小孩原在那个医院治的到那个医院去，这儿不管。’我告诉他小孩未到医院去治过病。大夫说：‘那么到孩子不行的时候再来吧！’这叫我怎么办呀！”
    该院常不按规定时间（八点）上班。如八月五日八点半了，该院仍未上班；门外拥挤着看病的人，也无人过问。有人向该院工作人员问挂号手续，他们常不加理睬。有的农村妇女在候诊室等候，大夫叫名字时没答应，大夫就狠狠地训斥：“你还知道你姓什么不！”
    我建议该院迅速纠正这种官僚主义作风，更好地为人民服务。
                                              王哲一、文伯屏
