    Shanghai Renren Publishing House Defrauds Readers of Book Payments; Case Submitted to People's Court
    Editor:
    I strongly agree with the two readers' accusations in the "Reader Letters" column of your newspaper on August 7th regarding the Shanghai Renren Publishing House's illegal act of defrauding readers of book payments by pre-ordering "People's Encyclopedia." I am also a victim. On May 23rd of this year, I remitted 320,000 yuan to the publishing house to pre-order four copies of "People's Encyclopedia." On July 16th, I received a letter from the publishing house dated June 23rd, stating that they were "automatically ceasing publication" and asking for my opinion on whether I would like to purchase other publications from the publishing house. After looking at their catalog, I found that they were all old books, so I replied to the publishing house on July 17th, stating that I would not purchase other books and requesting that they refund the book payment. However, I have not received a reply to this letter. Clearly, this is a fraudulent act. I hope that the Shanghai publishing administrative organs and industrial and commercial management organs will quickly investigate how many pre-orders the Renren Publishing House has for "People's Encyclopedia" and force them to clear them up. I believe that the competent authorities should strengthen the management of private publishers, formulate necessary measures, review whether they have the conditions to engage in the publishing industry (first of all, whether they have a qualified editorial department and a certain business policy), and regularly supervise them to prevent them from engaging in speculation and profiteering. Publishers like Renren Publishing House who engage in speculation and deception must be purged.

    Editor:
    In late June, we received a letter from Shanghai Renren Publishing House, which stated: "...Our firm will soon publish a series of colored portraits of world revolutionary leaders. Any organs or groups from different regions who would like to order them will be given a 20% discount..." For work needs, we immediately wrote to order two sets and remitted 170,000 yuan along with the letter. On July 18th, we received a pre-order form from Renren Publishing House; there has been no information since then; nor have the portraits of the leaders been sent. We have written twice (August 8th and August 15th) to inquire and ask about the reason, but we have not received a reply from Renren Publishing House. This is clearly a fraudulent act, and we hope that the competent authorities will investigate and deal with it.

    Editor's Note: We have received many letters from readers accusing Shanghai Renren Publishing House of defrauding people of money under false pretenses. According to a letter from the Shanghai Municipal News and Publications Bureau: This case has been transferred by the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce to the court for handling. The court is currently investigating the publishing house's assets to determine how to repay the pre-order book payments. This fraudulent behavior of Shanghai Renren Publishing House is intolerable. We agree with Mr. Ji Xingru's opinion that, in order to curb speculation, the competent authorities should strengthen the management of private publishers.

专栏：读者来信

    上海人人出版社骗取书款
    此案已送交人民法院处理编辑同志：
    我很同意八月七日你报“读者来信”栏发表的两位读者检举上海人人出版社借预约“人民百科大辞典”骗取书款的不法行为，因为我也是受骗的一个。我在今年五月二十三日汇给该社三十二万元，预约“人民百科大辞典”四部。我于七月十六日接到该社六月二十三日的信，上面说：“自动停止出版”，并征求我的意见，是否可购该社的其他出版物。我看了他们的书目，完全是些旧书，即于七月十七日函复该社，声明不购其他书籍，请他们将书款退还；但此信一直没有得到答复。显然，这是一种骗子的行为。我希望上海的出版行政机关和工商管理机关，迅速调查人人出版社“人民百科大辞典”的预约订户有多少，强制加以清理。我以为主管机关应该加强对私营出版商的管理，制订必要的办法，审查他们是否有经营出版业的条件（首先是是否有一个合格的编辑部和一定的业务方针），并经常予以监督，以免他们投机倒把。像人人出版社这种投机欺骗的出版商是必须清洗的。
    平原新乡  季星如编辑同志：
    在六月下旬，我们收到上海人人出版社信件一封，信中说：“……我处于最近将出版一种彩色世界革命领袖像，各地机关团体如有订购者，一律按八折优待……。”我们为了工作需要，当即去信订购两套，并随函汇去人民币十七万元。七月十八日，我们收到人人出版社的预约单一份；嗣后再无信息；也不见领袖像寄来。我们曾两次（八月八日、八月十五日）去信查询，追问原因，但都没有得到人人出版社的答复。这显然是一种欺骗行为，希望主管机关调查处理。

    编者按：我们曾接到很多读者来信检举上海人人出版社借名骗款的事。据上海市新闻出版处来信说：这一案件已由上海市工商局移送法院处理，法院正在清查该社资产，以决定偿还预约书款的办法。上海人人出版社这种欺骗行为是不能容忍的。我们同意季星如君所提意见，为了制止投机风气，主管机关对私营出版商应该加强管理。
