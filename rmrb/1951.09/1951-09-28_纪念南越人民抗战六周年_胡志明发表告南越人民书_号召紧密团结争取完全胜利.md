Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 25th: President Ho Chi Minh issued a letter to the people of South Vietnam on September 23rd, the sixth anniversary of the South Vietnamese people and army's resistance against French colonialists.

In his letter to the people, President Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the Central Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, congratulated all soldiers and civilians in South Vietnam for their patriotic enthusiasm and heroic fighting spirit. The letter pointed out that the arduous and heroic struggle waged by the Vietnamese people has inflicted heavy losses on the imperialists. Now the imperialists are attempting to implement a policy of using war to sustain war, and using Vietnamese to kill Vietnamese. This cruel policy proves the increasing weakness of the imperialist aggressors and the certainty of their war of aggression to fail; because the Vietnamese people will never betray their country and will never be willing to be lackeys of the aggressors and traitors.

The letter to the people said: "The Central Government calls on the compatriots, army soldiers and cadres, people's organizations and government agency staff in South Vietnam to unite more closely, carry out a more arduous struggle, overcome all difficulties, smash the enemy's cruel policies, and thereby make more contributions to the long-term arduous struggle waged by the people of the whole country, and achieve complete victory at an early date."

    纪念南越人民抗战六周年
    胡志明发表告南越人民书
    号召紧密团结争取完全胜利
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十五日讯：胡志明主席在九月二十三日南越人民和军队对法国殖民者抗战六周年纪念日，发表告南越人民书。
    胡志明主席在告人民书中，代表越南民主共和国中央政府，祝贺南越全体军民的爱国热情和英勇战斗的精神。告人民书指出：越南人民所进行的艰苦而英勇的斗争，已经使帝国主义者遭受了惨重的损失。现在帝国主义者又企图实行以战养战，以越南人杀越南人的政策。这种残酷的政策证明帝国主义侵略者的日益软弱和他们的侵略战争一定要失败；因为越南人民是决不会出卖祖国，决不甘愿作侵略者和卖国贼的走狗的。
    告人民书说：“中央政府号召南越的同胞们、军队的战士和干部们、人民团体和政府机关的工作人员们，更紧密地团结起来，进行更艰苦的斗争，克服一切困难，粉碎敌人的残酷政策，从而对全国人民所进行的长期艰苦斗争作更多的贡献，早日取得完全的胜利。”
