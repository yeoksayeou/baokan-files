Some Creations in "Liberation Army Literature and Art" Reflect the Heroic Qualities of the People's Army

How to correctly reflect the essence of the People's Liberation Army and create heroic figures of the People's Liberation Army is a crucial issue in current literary and artistic creation. Since its inception on June 16th, "Liberation Army Literature and Art" has paid close attention to this issue and has published works such as "Wind and Snow on the Eastern Front" (novella by Lu Zhuguo), "Eliminate the Aggressors" (five-act opera, collaboration by Song Zhidi, Ding Yi, and Wei Wei), and "Plant the Red Flag on the Himalayas" (report, collaboration by Ji Xichen and Wei Feng), which have achieved good results in this regard. The recently published third issue, including the two special collections "Commemorating August 1st" and "Marching into Tibet," provides a more concentrated and authentic representation of the excellent qualities of the People's Liberation Army. The eight articles in the "Commemorating August 1st" special collection were written by Red Army commanders and fighters who participated in the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars. In the form of memoirs, they recounted brilliant historical fragments such as the Nanchang Uprising, the Jinggangshan struggle, and the Long March, writing about the high political consciousness, fighting optimism, arduous struggle, and close relationship between officers and soldiers, and between the army and the people, of the Red Army troops. People's leader Chairman Mao encouraged the fighting will of the Red Army soldiers with his popular and powerful speeches during the most difficult stages of the revolution, in the struggle to maintain the initial revolutionary base area - Jinggangshan. There is also a vivid narrative in Comrade Zhu Liangcai's "This Mountain, It Revolutions!". The ten articles in the "Marching into Tibet" special collection were written by comrades who participated in the march into Tibet in the form of newsletters and reports. No high mountains, grasslands, or blizzards can stop the advancing ranks of the People's Liberation Army, and no differences in language or customs can separate the friendship between the People's Army and the Tibetan people. In the article, the excellent qualities of the Red Army are highly manifested and carried forward in the People's Liberation Army marching into Tibet.

    “解放军文艺”中的一些创作反映了人民军队的英雄品质
    如何正确地反映人民解放军的本质，创造人民解放军的英雄人物形象，是当前文艺创作中一个极重要的问题。“解放军文艺”自六月十六日创刊以来，即对此问题十分注意，并已发表“风雪东线”（中篇小说，陆柱国作）、“消灭侵略者”（五场歌剧，宋之的、丁毅、魏巍合作）、“把红旗插上喜马拉雅山”（报告，纪希晨、魏风合作）等在这一方面有较好成绩的作品。最近出版的第三期所包括的“纪念八一”和“进军西藏”两个特辑，对于人民解放军的优秀品质更有集中的、真实的表现。“纪念‘八一’”特辑的八篇文章由曾经参加第一次、第二次国内革命战争的红军指战员写成，他们用回忆录的形式记述了南昌起义、井冈山斗争、长征生活等光辉的历史断片，写出了红军部队高度的政治觉悟、战斗的乐观主义精神、艰苦卓绝的斗争以及亲密的官兵关系、军民关系。人民领袖毛主席在革命最艰苦的阶段，在坚持革命最初根据地——井岗山的斗争中，用通俗有力的讲话鼓舞着红军战士的斗争意志。在朱良才同志的“这座山，它革命！”一文里，也有生动的叙述。“进军西藏”特辑的十篇文章由参加向西藏进军的同志们采用通讯、报告的形式写成。任何高山、草原、风雪冰雹都阻挡不了人民解放军进军的行列，任何语言、风俗习惯的不同也隔阂不了人民军队和西藏人民的友情。文中，红军优秀品质在向西藏进军的人民解放军身上得到高度的表现和发扬。
