Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: Korean People's Army Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander Peng Dehuai today replied to Ridgway's letter of September 6th. The full text is as follows:

General Ridgway:

Your letter of September 6th continues to deny and refuse to address the series of provocative incidents your side has committed since August 22nd, which violate the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement. You continue to make false accusations, insisting that these incidents are either without factual basis or deliberately fabricated by our side. In this letter, you also propose changing the meeting venue, attempting to evade your inescapable responsibility for violating the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement and hindering the progress of the armistice negotiations. We find your letter completely unsatisfactory and unacceptable. You attempt to use the fact that the Kaesong Neutral Zone is within our area of responsibility to cover up the truth of your side's series of provocative incidents that violated the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement, and to shift the serious responsibility for these incidents to our side. We must say that your efforts are futile.

Precisely on the issue of the Kaesong Neutral Zone, our side's attitude has been consistently serious, responsible, and compliant with the agreement, while your side has never adhered to the agreement, which you proposed, that "both sides agree not to engage in any hostile actions within this neutral zone during our entire meeting."

Let us now, before the just people of the world, examine the facts of the past two months. After the start of the Kaesong negotiations, your side, under the pretext of journalists failing to enter Kaesong and our military police inadvertently entering the conference area, twice announced the suspension of the meeting without any consultation. In order not to hinder the negotiations, our side quickly provided your side with reasonable solutions and immediately agreed to the proposal regarding the neutralization of Kaesong.

What about your side? First of all, the United Nations Command air force has never stopped flying low and circling over the Kaesong Neutral Zone since the establishment of the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement on July 14th. Later, on August 16th, there was a specific provision that no military aircraft should enter the airspace of the Kaesong Neutral Zone, but the United Nations Command aircraft continued to intrude into the airspace of the Kaesong Neutral Zone to conduct hostile reconnaissance and patrol activities. According to our records, there were a total of 31 intrusions from August 17th to August 30th, and a total of 139 intrusions from September 1st to September 8th. Your side has never dared to give a positive response to these consistent violations of the agreement, despite our repeated protests. If the armed forces, which you proposed, "not to engage in any hostile actions within this neutral zone" does not include the air force, what kind of neutral zone is it? If it should include the air force, then the United Nations Command's aircraft intruding into the airspace of the Kaesong Neutral Zone for reconnaissance and patrol activities over the past two months has violated the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement.

Based on the logical development of your side's aerial hostile actions, it is sufficient to prove that the aircraft that bombed the vicinity of our delegation's residence in the Kaesong Neutral Zone on August 22nd and September 1st, and dropped flares over the Kaesong Neutral Zone on August 29th, were undoubtedly the aircraft of the United Nations Command. Moreover, our side has irrefutable eyewitness accounts and material evidence. Furthermore, these provocative actions are still developing. At 1:35 PM on September 10th, one of your military aircraft intruded into the airspace of the Kaesong Neutral Zone and strafed the conference area. After investigation by the liaison officers of both sides, the bullet marks are still there, which is undeniable. We now lodge another serious protest with you regarding your side's endless provocative actions.

In the past two months, the ground forces of the United Nations Command have also conducted planned provocative actions. On July 16th and August 25th, armed forces of the United Nations Command twice intruded into Panmunjom and its vicinity in the Kaesong Neutral Zone, and fired on our military police personnel. On August 19th and 30th, South Korean troops belonging to the United Nations Command twice intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone, attacking and murdering our military police personnel. Regarding these two incidents, our side not only has general eyewitness accounts and material evidence, but also captured reconnaissance members of the South Korean troops who directly participated in the incidents.

All of the above facts are sufficient to prove that although the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement was proposed by you, you intended to use it to restrain our side but not yourselves. Although you guaranteed in this letter that your troops would not violate the Kaesong Neutral Zone agreement, the incidents of your troops violating the agreement have been emerging endlessly for the past two months, but you have refused to handle them. How can such a guarantee not be considered a deceptive tactic?

Of course, we have the power to control the area under our responsibility. However, since you and we have agreed to designate Kaesong as a neutral zone for the duration of the negotiations, and our side has accepted the constraints of the implementation clauses of the neutral zone agreement, we have the right to demand that your side also accept this constraint and not violate the Kaesong Neutral Zone agreement.

Your only way to evade your side's responsibility for all these violations of the agreement is to deny them, either saying that these incidents are baseless or that these incidents were deliberately fabricated by our side. However, the facts are clear, the evidence is conclusive, and it is difficult for your side to justify even your own denials. Therefore, your side is using a tactic of shifting the target, proposing to change the meeting venue, in order to evade the responsibility for handling your side's series of provocative incidents and to create an excuse for your side to break off the negotiations when needed. It should be pointed out that your attempt will not succeed. Because, even according to your logic of slandering our side, since all these provocative incidents that violated the agreement were "fabricated" and "forged" by our side, why don't you dare to demand an investigation into the truth of all these incidents, dare to propose a solution, or even dare to review these incidents, but instead allow our side to repeatedly demand investigation and handling of all these incidents? Since you stated in this letter that the clause guaranteeing that your troops would not violate the agreement on the Kaesong Neutral Zone is still valid, and our side has always practically guaranteed the implementation of this agreement clause, why do you still suggest changing the meeting venue? This extremely obvious contradiction is sufficient to prove that your side's proposal to change the meeting venue is for the purpose of evading your side's responsibility for violating the agreement and creating an excuse for breaking off the negotiations, rather than for the benefit of resuming the negotiations.

There is no doubt that since the beginning of the armistice negotiations and the establishment of the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement, our side has been responsible for ensuring that Kaesong has all the conditions for a negotiating venue, which can be proven by all records related to this type of issue from the Kaesong negotiations meeting. If it were not for your side's willful violation of the Kaesong Neutral Zone agreement, creating a series of provocative incidents, how could the Kaesong conference have been unable to proceed? As long as your side seriously and responsibly handles this series of provocative incidents and guarantees not to violate the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement again, the Kaesong conference venue is a great place to strive to reach a fair and reasonable armistice agreement. If your side does not seriously and responsibly handle these incidents, no matter where you change the meeting venue to, there is no reason to guarantee that the same or even more serious provocative incidents will not occur again. Furthermore, your side is openly unwilling to abide by an agreement for a neutral zone, so what reason is there to expect your side to abide by an armistice agreement?

Therefore, we now once again demand that you: quickly end your side's endless actions of violating the agreement, take responsibility for handling the various provocative incidents that our side has protested, and then the negotiations can continue on a normal and equal footing. Otherwise, your side should bear full responsibility for delaying and obstructing the progress of the negotiations and its consequences.

Awaiting your reply.

Korean People's Army Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung
Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander Peng Dehuai
September 11, 1951

Ridgway's letter of September 6th:

"General Kim Il-sung
General Peng Dehuai:

Your letter dated September 1st, which I received on September 2nd, is yet another of your fabricated accusations. In this accusation, you again question the integrity of the United Nations forces without any factual basis. The allegations you have made in these so-called incidents are baseless and deliberately fabricated. I have stated before and am willing to state again emphatically that our thorough investigation has shown that the troops under my command have never violated any agreement agreed upon by me or my representatives. Therefore, if these incidents did occur, it can be assumed that they were initiated and done by your troops in order to provide forged evidence for your false and malicious accusations against the Allied forces.

I cannot provide you with guarantees for your failure to enforce control in the areas under your responsibility. I cannot prevent incidents from occurring in the areas under your control that are deliberately and maliciously fabricated by your troops. I have previously guaranteed that the troops on our side will not violate the terms of the agreement regarding the Kaesong Neutral Zone. My troops have carefully complied with the terms of that agreement, and my guarantee is still valid.

It is incomprehensible that you would allow the troops on your side to indulge in constant deception and slander, unless you have ulterior motives, attempting to completely break off the negotiations with more rude and disrespectful accusations, so that the Allied forces, rather than your side, bear the blame.

For the benefit of millions of United Nations people, as the commander of their field troops, I ask you to stop these despicable practices that have been condemned by the world.

These military armistice discussions in Kaesong have been going on for seven weeks. You must share my concern about the lack of progress. I have repeatedly emphasized that my main concern is to reach a fair and honorable military armistice. The events of the past few weeks have clearly shown to me and the world that continuing to use the current meeting address in Kaesong will inevitably cause more obstacles in our armistice negotiations and further delay reaching an agreement.

When you decided to end the suspension of the armistice negotiations that you announced on August 23rd, I suggested that our liaison officers immediately meet by the bridge in Panmunjom to discuss the issue of choosing a new meeting address where negotiations could continue without obstruction.

Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command
General of the Army Matthew B. Ridgway"

### 美方妄图更换会址逃脱挑衅罪责  金日成彭德怀两将军痛斥李奇微  严正指出美方必须负责处理挑衅事件谈判才能继续

    美方妄图更换会址逃脱挑衅罪责
    金日成彭德怀两将军痛斥李奇微
    严正指出美方必须负责处理挑衅事件谈判才能继续
    【新华社十一日讯】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀今日致函答覆李奇微六日的来信，全文如下：李奇微将军：
    你的九月六日来信，仍然一味抵赖并拒绝处理你方自八月二十二日以来破坏开城区中立化协议的一连串的挑衅事件，仍然含血喷人，硬说这些事件不是毫无事实根据，就是我方故意制造出来的。你在这封信中，并还提出更换会议地址的建议，企图以此逃脱你方对于破坏开城区中立化协议和阻挠停战谈判进行所不能逃脱的责任。我们对于你的来信，认为是完全不能满意，并且是不能接受的。你企图用开城中立区在我方负责地区之内这一事实，来掩盖你方破坏开城区中立化协议的一连串挑衅事件的真相，并把你方应对这些事件所负的严重责任转嫁于我方，我们应该说，你的这种努力是徒劳的。正是在开城区中立化这个问题上，我方的态度是一贯认真负责、遵守协议的，而你们方面，则对于由你所建议而达成的“我们双方同意在我们整个会议期间在这个中立区内不得从事任何敌对行动”的协议，从来就不加以遵守。我们现在在全世界公正人民面前，检查一下两个月来的事实经过吧。开城谈判开始以后，你方曾藉口新闻记者未能进入开城及我方军事警察部队误入会场地区的事件，不经任何协商，两次宣布停会，我方为了不使谈判受到阻挠起见，都迅速地给了你方以合理的解决，并立即同意了关于开城区中立化的建议。至于你们方面呢？首先是联合国军的空军，自七月十四日开城区中立化协议成立后，从来就未曾停止过在开城中立区上空的低飞盘旋。后来在八月十六日虽又有了任何军用飞机不得侵入开城中立区上空的具体规定，但联合国军的飞机仍然继续侵入开城中立区上空，进行巡逻侦察的敌对行动，据我方已有记录，自八月十七日至八月三十日止，共侵入三十一架次，自九月一日至九月八日止，共侵入一百三十九架次，你方对于这类一贯破坏协议的敌对行动，虽经我方多次抗议，从来就不敢给予正面回答。如果说，你所建议的“在这个中立区内不得从事任何敌对行动”的武装力量，竟不包括空军在内。世界上还有什么中立区可言？如果说，应该包括空军在内，那么，两个月来，联合国军的飞机侵入开城中立区上空进行巡逻侦察的敌对行动，就是破坏了开城区中立化的协议。根据你方这一空中敌对行动的逻辑发展，就足以说明八月二十二日、九月一日两次轰炸开城中立区我方代表团住所附近及八月二十九日在开城中立区上空投下照明弹的飞机，定然是联合国军的飞机无疑，何况我方更掌握着不可动摇的人证和物证呢？并且这种挑衅行动仍在发展，九月十日一时三十五分，你方军用飞机一架又侵入开城中立区上空，向会场地区施行扫射，经过双方联络官的调查，弹痕俱在，无可否认。我们现在对于你方这种无休止的挑衅行动，再度向你提出严重抗议。联合国军的地面部队，在两个月中，也同样进行了有计划的挑衅行动。在七月十六日和八月二十五日联合国军武装部队两次侵入开城中立区板门店及其附近，向我方军事警察人员进行射击。在八月十九日和三十日，联合国军所属南朝鲜部队两次侵入开城中立区，袭击和谋杀我方军事警察人员。关于这两次事件，我方不仅有一般的人证物证，而且俘获了直接参加此事的南朝鲜部队的侦察队员。
    上述这一切事实，都足以证明开城区中立化的协议，虽然是你所建议，但你是企图用来约束我方而不约束你们自己的。尽管你在这次来信中，又保证你方部队不会破坏开城中立区的协议，但两个月来你方部队破坏协议的事件已层出不穷，而你却一概拒绝处理，试问这种保证岂不成为欺人之谈？
    我方负责的地区，我们当然有力量实行控制。但你我双方既经同意划开城为谈判期间的中立区，我方并已接受关于中立区协议的实施条款的约束，就有权利要求你方也接受这个约束，不来破坏开城中立区的协议。你现在逃避你方对于这一切破坏协议事件的责任的唯一办法，就是抵赖，不是说这些事件毫无根据，就是说这些事件都是我方故意制造出来的。可是事实昭彰，证据确凿，欲加否认，连你方自己也难自圆其说。于是你方乃用转移目标的办法，提议更换会议地址，以逃避处理你方破坏协议的一连串的挑衅事件的责任，并为你方需要破裂谈判时制造藉口。应该指出，你的这种企图是不会成功的。因为即照你方诬蔑我方的逻辑来讲，既然这一切破坏协议的挑衅事件是我方“虚构”和“伪造”的，为什么你方不敢要求追究这一切事件的真相，不敢提出处理，甚至不敢覆查这些事件，反而任凭我方一再要求追查和处理这一切事件呢？既然你在这次来信中，声明仍然有效保证你方部队不会破坏关于开城中立区的协议的条款，而我方则一向在实际上保证了这一协议条款的实施，为什么你还要建议更换会议地址呢？这种异常明显的矛盾，足以证明你方关于更换会议地址的建议，就是为的逃避你方破坏协议的责任，并为破裂谈判制造藉口，而不是为的有利于谈判的恢复。
    毫无疑问，自从停战谈判开始及开城区中立化协议成立后，我方已负责保证，使开城具备了谈判地点的一切条件，这是开城谈判会议有关这类问题的全部记录可以证明的。如果不是你方恣意破坏开城区中立化协议，制造一连串的挑衅事件，开城会议何至于无法进行？只要你方认真负责地处理这一连串的挑衅事件，并保证不再破坏开城区中立化的协议，则开城会议地址正好用来努力达成公平合理的停战协议。如果你方不认真负责地处理这些事件，不管你把会议地址更换到什么地方，没有任何理由可以保证同样的甚至更加严重的挑衅事件不再发生。并且你方对于一个中立区的协议都公然不愿遵守，尚有什么理由可以期待你方遵守一个停战协议呢？
    因此，我们现在再一次要求你：迅速结束你方这种无休止的破坏协议的行动，负责处理我方所抗议的各次挑衅事件，然后才能使谈判在正常平等的基础上继续进行。否则，你方应对拖延和阻挠谈判的进行及其后果，担负全部责任。
    等待你的回答。朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
    一九五一年九月十一日李奇微九月六日的来信“金日成将军彭德怀将军：
    你们给我的注明日期为九月一日而我于九月二日收到的信件，是你们又一次虚构的指责。在这指责中，你们一点事实根据也没有地再度怀疑了联合国军队的信义。你们在这些据称的事件中所作的指控是毫无根据而且蓄意虚构的。我曾经声明过并且愿意再度断然地声明：我们周详的调查已表明我所指挥的部队从未违反过我或我的代表所同意的任何协议。因此如果这些事件的确曾经发生，可以假定它们是由你们的部队所发动和做出来的，以便为你们对联军所作的虚假和恶意的指控提供伪造的证据。
    我不能为你们未能在你方所负责的区域中实施管制而向你们提供保证。我不能防止在你们所管制的区域中发生由你们的部队蓄意地并恶毒地制造出来的事件。我以前已保证过我方的部队将不违反关于开城中立区的协议的条款。我的部队一直谨慎地遵守那协议的条款，我的保证现在仍然有效。
    你们竟然允许你们那一方面的部队沉溺于不断地欺诈和诽谤，那是一件不能理解的事，除非你们有着别有用心的动机，企图用更为粗鲁无礼的指控，来使谈判完全破裂，从而使联军而不是你方承受责难。
    为了千百万联合国人民的利益，作为他们战地部队的司令官，我要求你们停止这些已经受到全世界谴责的卑鄙作法。
    开城的这些军事停战讨论已进行了七个星期。你们对于缺少进展一事一定与我抱有同样的关切。我已经再三强调，我主要的关怀便是达成一个公平和光荣的军事停战。过去几周中的事件已经很清楚地向我及全世界表明，继续使用目前在开城的会议地址将无可避免地在我们的停战谈判中造成更多的阻挠，并在达成协议一事上受到进一步的拖延。
    当你们决定终止你们在八月二十三日所宣布的停战谈判的暂停状态时，我建议我们的联络官立刻在板门店的桥边会晤，以讨论选择一个谈判得以不受阻挠地继续下去的新会址问题。联合国军总司令美国陆军上将李奇微”
