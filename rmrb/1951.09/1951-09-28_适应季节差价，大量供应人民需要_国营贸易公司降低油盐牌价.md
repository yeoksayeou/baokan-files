    Adapting to Seasonal Price Differences, Ensuring Ample Supply to Meet People's Needs
    State-Owned Trading Companies Lower Prices of Oil and Salt
    According to the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, state-owned trading companies across the country have successively lowered the prices of oil and salt on the 25th and 27th of this month. This price reduction is to adjust the seasonal price differences of oil and salt and to provide ample supply to meet the needs of the people. After the adjustment, the average oil price of state-owned trading companies across the country has been reduced by 5%. For example, the selling price of ordinary raw oil in Beijing and Tianjin has been reduced by 3.2% to 4%, in Shanghai and Hankou by 5.8%, and in Guangzhou by 6.8%.
    At the same time, in view of the fact that the China Salt Industry Company has improved its operation and management, reduced commodity circulation costs, and lowered commodity costs, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government instructed the state-owned salt companies to lower the selling price of edible salt, with a reduction range of 1% to 2.8%. The price of edible salt in Beijing has been reduced by 1.1%, in Shanghai by 2.6%, in Jinan by 1.6%, and in Bengbu by 2.8%. (Xinhua News Agency)

    适应季节差价，大量供应人民需要
    国营贸易公司降低油盐牌价
    全国各地国营贸易公司已根据中央人民政府贸易部指示，于本月二十五日、二十七日先后降低油、盐牌价。这次降低牌价是为了调整油、盐季节差价和大量供应人民需要。调整后，全国各地国营贸易公司油价平均降低百分之五。例如，大路生油的出售牌价在北京、天津两地降低百分之三点二到百分之四，上海、汉口两地降低百分之五点八，广州降低百分之六点八。
    同时，中央人民政府贸易部鉴于中国盐业公司已经改善了经营管理工作，减低了商品流通费用，商品成本降低，因而指示国营盐业公司降低食盐出售牌价，降低幅度在百分之一到百分之二点八。北京食盐牌价降低了百分之一点一，上海降低百分之二点六，济南降低百分之一点六，蚌埠降低百分之二点八。  （新华社）
