The editorial departments of newspapers and periodicals writing and publishing articles guiding writing based on problems in readers' submissions is an effective method of helping and cultivating novice writers. "Northeast Literature and Art," "Guangming Daily," "China Youth Daily," and others have all published articles of this kind. "On Generalization and Formulaization," published in the fifth issue of the fourth volume of "People's Literature" in September, is one that is worth recommending. This article analyzes many novel manuscripts submitted by readers describing marriage issues, production issues, patriotic behavior, etc., pointing out the tendency of generalization and formulaization that currently exists in young people's literary creation. It also analyzes the reasons for this tendency, mainly that the authors do not delve deeply into real life, cannot discover and accumulate more material in life, and cannot synthesize and refine it meticulously. This is because the authors' ideological level is low, and when observing reality, thinking about problems, and considering structure, they cannot generalize and concentrate on expressing the theme. Therefore, when writing, they only know how to apply some creative formulas, such as "contrast method," "obstacle method," "lesson method," "misunderstanding method," etc., which naturally cannot express vivid and rich real life, but make the works empty, weak, and lagging behind reality. Since the tendency of formulaization and generalization raised in this article is a relatively common problem in current creation, it is helpful for novice writers.

    文学刊物应多发表指导写作的文章
    报纸刊物的编辑部，根据读者来稿中的问题，撰写并发表指导写作的文章，是帮助和培养初学写作者的有效方法之一。《东北文艺》、《光明日报》、《中国青年报》等都曾登载过这一类的文章。九月份出版的第四卷五期《人民文学》所登载的《论一般化公式化》是其中值得推荐的一篇。该文将许多读者投寄的描写婚姻问题、生产问题、爱国主义行为等等的小说原稿，加以分析，指出目前青年文艺创作中存在着一般化公式化的倾向。并分析了产生这种倾向的原因，主要是由于作者没有深入现实生活，不能在生活中发掘和积累更多的素材，精密地加以综合和提炼，这是由于作者思想水平低，在观察现实时，思考问题时，考虑结构时，不能概括、集中地来表现主题。因此，在写作时，就只知道套用一些创作公式，如“对比法”、“阻碍法”、“教训法”、“误会法”等，这自然不能表现生动丰富的现实生活，而使作品成为空泛贫弱、落后于现实的东西。由于该文提出的公式化、一般化倾向，是目前创作中比较普遍存在的问题，因此，它对于初学写作者是有帮助的。
