    Smashing U.S. Imperialist Espionage Activities

    (X) The criminal conspiracy of Antonio Riva and others was uncovered in advance by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. The seized evidence included a 60mm mortar, pistols, bullets, two "identity certificates" issued by the Japanese "North China Area Army Headquarters Reporting Department," and hundreds of letters and telegrams exchanged between Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi, and John Powell regarding their espionage activities.
    (XI) These special agent spies and bandits were all captured by us. Facts and evidence forced them to admit their heinous crimes. The Military Control Commission Military Court of the Beijing Municipal People's Liberation Army sentenced them according to their respective crimes.
    (XII) Antonio Riva and Ryuichi Yamaguchi were sentenced to death. These American special agent spies fell before the Chinese people who have stood up. We should draw profound lessons from this case: U.S. imperialism is constantly plotting against us, and we should be vigilant at all times, extinguish the enemy's espionage activities, and fight to defend the security of the motherland.

    （十）李安东等罪恶的阴谋事先就被北京市人民政府公安局破获了，攫出的罪证有六零迫击炮一门及手枪、子弹、日本“北支那方面军司令部报导部”所发的“身份证明书”等两件，及李安东、山口隆一和包瑞德间谍活动的往来信件、电报等数百件。
    （十一）这些特务间谍匪徒们全部被我们捕获，事实和证据迫使他们不得不承认自己的滔天罪行。中国人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会军法处根据各犯罪行，分别予以判刑。
    （十二）李安东和山口隆一被判处死刑。这些美国特务间谍分子，在已经站起来了的中国人民面前倒下去了。我们应该从这个案件中取得深刻的教训：美帝国主义无时不在暗算我们，我们应时刻警惕，扑灭敌人的间谍活动，为保卫祖国的安全而斗争。（完）
