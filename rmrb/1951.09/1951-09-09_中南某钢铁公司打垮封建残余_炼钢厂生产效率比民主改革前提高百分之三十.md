    A Certain Steel Company in Central and Southern China Smashes Feudal Remnants
    Steel Mill's Production Efficiency Increases by Thirty Percent Compared to Before the Democratic Reform
    A certain steel company in Central and Southern China carried out a democratic reform movement, smashing the feudal reactionary forces remaining within the company after liberation, paving the way for the smooth development of future production. The covert sabotage of feudal reactionary elements was a serious problem that the company had failed to thoroughly resolve in the past two years. In those two years, the company had carried out democratic movements, democratic management, production competitions, and other work; the trade union organization had also developed. After two years of political education, the workers' class consciousness had improved, and a group of activists had emerged in various tasks. Therefore, the company was able to quickly restore production, changing the situation of never having produced normally before liberation in a short period after liberation. Before and after the launch of the production competition, the output of the open-hearth furnace in the steel mill nearly tripled. However, due to the lack of a mass reform movement from the bottom up, counter-revolutionaries and feudal reactionary elements could not be thoroughly eliminated, and they continued to lurk inside the enterprise to carry out sabotage, causing serious obstacles to the production and management of the company's various plants. On June 18, 1949, when the open-hearth furnace of the steel mill first produced steel, Ge Shutong, a feudal foreman of the plant, in order to crack down on activists in production, personally drove the crane to damage the furnace body with the steel ladle, causing all the molten steel to leak out. In December of the same year, the counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the company, colluding with feudal remnants, conspired to incite some backward workers to resist under the pretext of donating year-end double salaries. When the company implemented democratic management last May, feudal reactionary elements took the opportunity to provoke workers' dissatisfaction with trade unions, administrative leading cadres, and production activists, undermining the unity within the working class. When the company's trade union led the workers to launch a production competition movement last July, feudal reactionary elements also adopted various methods to obstruct and sabotage. They used gang relations to control merit evaluation, usurp the fruits of labor of activists, and used the "circulating merit" method (that is, feudal remnants took turns to elect each other as "models") to embezzle bonuses. Some of these feudal remnants also used various methods to sneak into administrative management departments and trade union organizations, and some even usurped the leadership positions of grass-roots trade unions. For example, the grass-roots trade union of the steel mill not only had a feudal foreman, Chen Zesheng, as its chairman, but also three of the other ten committee members were gang leaders and feudal foremen, one was a "battalion commander" of the Kuomintang "Peace Salvation Army," and one was a traitor. Due to the sabotage of these feudal reactionary elements, accidents occurred constantly in the company's production. Among them, the larger accidents in the steel mill alone included three such as the explosion of the iron-smelting furnace. From January to March this year, the steel mill had a total of 52 accidents. The above serious situation only began to change after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries work was launched in April and May this year. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the local people's government public security organs arrested two special agents in the company. The masses of workers who had been oppressed by reactionary elements for a long time were greatly encouraged at this time, and they demanded to continue to expose and accuse counter-revolutionaries and to eliminate feudal reactionary forces. While exposing five counter-revolutionaries with blood debts, the workers of the steel mill exposed 33 feudal reactionary elements. Such an opportunity to thoroughly eliminate feudal reactionary forces by relying on the strength of the worker masses had finally arrived.
    The company's Communist Party Committee and trade union organization, according to the demands of the worker masses and in accordance with the decision of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on launching a democratic reform movement, immediately led the worker masses to launch a democratic reform movement on the basis of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
    In order to encourage the workers' fighting courage, the company's leadership department appropriately handled the feudal reactionary elements exposed by the workers in early July. At the same time, a group of cadres went deep into workshops, groups, and workers' residential areas, and organized a large number of activists who had emerged in the company since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the form of democratic reform groups and trade union central groups, becoming the backbone of the democratic reform movement. Through the efforts of these backbone members, more than 90% of the workers in the company's various plants actively participated in the democratic reform movement.
    Such a mass anti-feudal struggle not only did not "affect production" as some people worried, but on the contrary, production work was done even better. Although the steel mill of the company spent some time in July carrying out the anti-feudal democratic struggle, its production efficiency increased by 30% compared to before the movement. Peng Huafei, the newly appointed leader of the steel casting group of the steel mill, was an activist who had been heavily suppressed by feudal reactionary elements in the past. His rationalization proposal to use natural sand as the model for castings had been suppressed by the feudal reactionary elements of the plant for a whole year. Only on June 15th this year was his suggestion submitted to the administration for adoption and implementation. In July, his above-mentioned suggestion was further improved after everyone's research, and as a result, the yield of finished castings doubled. The output of the steel-making furnace in July has exceeded the quota by 21.2%, and the quality pass rate has reached 100%. In order to strictly prevent the sabotage of feudal reactionary elements, the units under the company have reorganized the workers' picket team to guard the factory day and night.

### 中南某钢铁公司打垮封建残余  炼钢厂生产效率比民主改革前提高百分之三十

    中南某钢铁公司打垮封建残余
    炼钢厂生产效率比民主改革前提高百分之三十
    中南某钢铁公司开展民主改革运动，打垮了解放以后残留在公司内部的封建反动势力，为今后生产的顺畅发展铺平了道路。封建反动分子的潜伏破坏，是该公司两年来没有澈底解决的一个严重问题。两年来，该公司曾进行过民主运动、民主管理、生产竞赛等工作；工会组织也有发展。工人经过两年的政治教育，阶级觉悟已有提高，并在各种工作中涌现了一批积极分子。因此，使该公司能在解放后短时期内改变了解放前从未正常生产的状况，迅速恢复生产。炼钢厂在开展生产竞赛前后，贝氏炉产量就提高了近三倍。但是因为缺乏一个自下而上的群众性的改革运动，反革命分子和封建反动分子未能澈底肃清，且仍继续潜伏在企业内部进行破坏，使该公司各厂生产和管理工作遭受到严重障碍。一九四九年六月十八日炼钢厂贝氏炉首次炼钢时，该厂封建把头葛树桐为了打击生产中的积极分子，即亲自驾驶天车，以钢包撞坏炉体，使钢水全部漏掉。同年十二月，该公司内潜藏的反革命分子更与封建残余分子相勾结，曾阴谋借捐献年终双薪事，煽动若干落后工人进行反抗。去年五月该公司实行民主管理时，封建反动分子又趁机挑拨工人对工会、行政领导干部以及生产积极分子的不满，破坏工人阶级内部的团结。去年七月，该公司工会领导工人开展生产竞赛运动时，封建反动分子也采取各种方法进行阻碍与破坏。他们利用帮派关系，把持评功，篡夺积极分子的劳动成果，并以“循环立功”办法（即封建残余分子们轮流着互选为“模范”），窃取奖金。其中有些封建残余分子还用各种方法钻进行政管理部门和工会组织，有的甚至窃取了基层工会的领导职位。例如炼钢厂的基层工会，不仅主席陈泽生是个封建把头，另外十个委员中，还有三个是青帮头子兼封建把头，一个是国民党“和平救国军”的“大队长”，一个是汉奸。由于这些封建反动分子的破坏，该公司在生产中不断发生事故，其中较大的事故仅在炼钢厂即有化铁炉爆炸等三起，今年一月至三月炼钢厂发生的事故共达五十二次。上述严重情况直到今年四、五月镇压反革命工作展开后才开始有了转变。在镇压反革命运动中，当地人民政府公安机关在该公司逮捕了两名特务分子。长期受反动分子压迫的工人群众，这时大为振奋，纷纷要求继续检举和控诉反革命分子，并要求肃清封建反动势力。炼钢厂工人在检举五个有血债的反革命分子的同时，就检举出三十三个封建反动分子。这样一个依靠工人群众力量澈底肃清封建反动势力的时机终于到来了。
    该公司中共党委与工会组织根据工人群众的要求，并按照中共中央中南局关于开展民主改革运动的决定，立即领导工人群众在镇压反革命工作的基础上展开了民主改革运动。
    为了鼓舞工人的斗争勇气，该公司领导部门在七月上旬把工人检举出的封建反动分子做了适当处理，同时又以一批干部深入到车间、小组和工人住宅区，把镇压反革命以来公司内涌现出的大批积极分子，用民主改革小组和工会中心小组的形式组织了起来，成为民主改革运动的骨干力量。通过这些骨干分子的努力，该公司所属各厂有百分之九十以上的工人都积极参加了民主改革的运动。
    这样一个群众性的反封建斗争，不但没有像有些人所顾虑的那样“影响生产”，相反，生产工作搞得更好了。该公司炼钢厂七月份虽因进行反封建民主斗争占去了一部分时间，但生产效率却比运动前提高了百分之三十。炼钢厂铸钢组新任组长彭华飞，过去是被封建反动分子打击很重的一个积极分子，他用天然砂做铸件模型的合理化建议过去被该厂封建反动分子整整压制了一年，今年六月十五日，他的这一建议才被提交行政采纳实行。七月份，他的上述建议又经过大家研究后做了改进，结果使铸件成品率又提高了一倍。炼钢炉七月份产量已超过定额百分之二十一点二，质量合格率已达到百分之百。为了严防封建反动分子的破坏，该公司所属单位已重新整顿了工人纠察队，日夜守护工厂。
