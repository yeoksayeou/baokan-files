Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th. According to TASS, "New York Times" diplomatic correspondent Reston, in commenting on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Ottawa, revealed serious contradictions between the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty nations. Reston wrote: Just as U.S. Secretary of State Acheson and others asserted that the North Atlantic nations were "united," increasingly large divisions were demonstrated at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting.

Reston believes that the Ottawa meeting failed to resolve the economic crisis in Western European countries caused by military expansion and preparations for war. Therefore, the U.S. expansion plan faces very bleak prospects. The United States promised at the Ottawa meeting to order military supplies from Western European countries to alleviate the dollar shortage in Western Europe. However, Reston believes that this measure cannot eliminate the increasingly severe dollar crisis in Europe. Reston said: "The dollar problem is much more acute than currently anticipated. This situation will become even more apparent after the British financial index is released on October 4th. If this dollar crisis cannot be alleviated, then Britain will intend to reduce its military efforts, which will give other countries an excuse to follow suit."

Reston revealed that the U.S.'s satellite states had already stated at the Ottawa meeting that the military expansion plan that Eisenhower wanted them to implement could not be guaranteed because they did not have sufficient funds, and they demanded that the United States bear the majority of the expansion costs. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder "gave a cold response" to this request. Snyder emphasized that there was no question of the United States paying the difference between what Western European countries believed they could pay and the actual costs of expansion. Snyder stated that the aforementioned countries should not expect Washington to solve their economic problems.

Reston wrote about this: As a result of Snyder's blunt statement of the U.S. position, "representatives of other countries are less optimistic about the prospects of achieving established goals, and indeed express pessimism about whether the plan for accelerating the expansion of armies and armaments proposed by the Standing Group of the North Atlantic Treaty Military Committee can be adopted in the near future."

Reston said: "The main problem that worries Europeans is that the United States thinks too much and plans too much about a large-scale classic Germanic war in Europe. ...Secretary of State Acheson and Treasury Secretary Snyder cannot convince Europeans that their contribution to European defense (should read as aggression) is insufficient."

### 纽约时报记者透露  西欧各国经济危机严重  美国扩军计划前途渺茫

    纽约时报记者透露
    西欧各国经济危机严重
    美国扩军计划前途渺茫
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：“纽约时报”外交记者莱斯顿在评论北大西洋公约理事会渥太华会议时，透露了美国与其他北大西洋公约国家间存在着严重的矛盾。莱斯顿写道：正当美国国务卿艾奇逊及其他等人断言北大西洋各国“团结一致”的时候，在北大西洋公约理事会的会议上却表现了越来越大的分歧。
    莱斯顿认为渥太华会议并没有能解决西欧各国由于扩军备战所引起的经济危机，因此美国的扩军计划前途十分渺茫。美国曾在渥太华会议上答应向西欧各国订购军事物资，以解救西欧的美元荒。但是，莱斯顿认为：这种措施并不能消除欧洲日益加剧的美元危机。莱斯顿说：“美元问题比目前所预料的尖锐得多。等十月四日英国财政指数发表后，这种情形便会更加明显。而这种美元危机如果不能予以缓和，那末英国就将打算减少其军事努力，这样一来，就给了其他国家以援例仿效的借口。”
    莱斯顿透露：美国各附庸国家已经在渥太华会议上声明：艾森豪威尔要它们实行的扩军计划是无法保证的，因为它们没有足够的资金，它们要求美国担负扩军费用中的大部分。但是，对于这种要求，美国财政部长斯奈德“给予了冷酷的回答”。斯奈德着重声明：谈不到让美国来偿付西欧国家认为自己能够支付的款项和扩军的实际支出两者之间的差额。斯奈德声明：上述各国不应期待华盛顿来解决它们的经济问题。
    莱斯顿对此写道：由于斯奈德直言不讳地说明美国立场的结果，“其他国家代表对于达成既定目标的前景已较少乐观，而对于北大西洋公约军事委员会常设小组所建议的加速扩充军队及军备的计划是否能在最近通过，确实表示悲观。”
    莱斯顿说：“使得欧洲人士担忧的主要问题，就是美国对于在欧洲进行一个大规模的古典日耳曼式的战争的问题想得太多，计划得太多了。……国务卿艾奇逊和财政部长斯奈德不能说服欧洲人，使他们相信他们对欧洲防务（应读为侵略）的贡献是不够的。”
