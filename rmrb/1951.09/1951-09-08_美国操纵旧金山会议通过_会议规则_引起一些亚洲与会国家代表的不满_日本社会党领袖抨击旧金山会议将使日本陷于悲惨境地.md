Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from San Francisco: The rules of procedure for the San Francisco Conference were unilaterally formulated by the United States in advance and forced upon some participating countries, in order to manipulate the San Francisco Conference and obstruct delegations from the Soviet Union and other countries from raising legitimate demands regarding the peace treaty with Japan at the meeting.

On the 3rd, the United States and Britain unilaterally convened a "special meeting" with France, Australia, the Philippines, and other nine countries to privately discuss the "rules and procedures" for the San Francisco Conference formulated by the United States and obtained "general agreement" on this. After the meeting, the United States and Britain distributed the "strict draft rules of procedure" to the delegations of various countries and announced it on the 4th.

At the first day of the San Francisco Conference, the United States forced the meeting to adopt this autocratic "rules of procedure." This "rules of procedure" exposed the United States' hegemonic practices. It stipulated that the San Francisco Conference would proceed "according to" the "conditions of the invitation letter" issued by the United States on July 20, namely: "The conference is held 'for the conclusion and signing' of the US-British peace treaty." The rules of procedure arbitrarily deprived the representatives of various countries of their right to speak at the meeting. The rules stipulated that after the United States and Britain spoke first at the meeting, other delegations "may speak, but in no case shall it exceed one hour," and "these speeches shall only be about the current peace treaty with Japan (referring to the US-made peace treaty with Japan)." Not only that, but the rules also stipulated: "After each representative speaks, he must wait until all other representatives have spoken before speaking again, and he can only speak when the meeting decides to allow further speeches (if allowed) and under what conditions." In addition, it stipulates: "No representative may address the meeting without prior approval from the chairman. The chairman has the right to require speakers to abide by the rules, and if he does not comply, the chairman may withdraw his approval and allow the next person to speak."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: The unreasonable and overbearing attitude adopted by US representative Acheson at the San Francisco Conference aroused dissatisfaction among some Asian countries' representatives. A United Press San Francisco dispatch on the 5th admitted: "Some Asian representatives attending the conference expressed dissatisfaction with the 'steamroller' tactics used by Acheson when forcing the first meeting to adopt the rules of procedure drafted by Britain and the United States." Some "Asian representatives" worried that this autocratic approach by the United States "would have a negative impact on public opinion in some regions of the Far East." United Press said that the Indonesian representative was "particularly disturbed" by Acheson's attitude of "abruptly dismissing" the motions of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Indonesia expressed disgust with Acheson's "steamroller" attitude. The Indonesian delegation "abstained almost every time" during the vote at the morning session on the 5th.

United Press also said: "The Pakistani representative is not entirely satisfied with the tactics of Britain and the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: The bourgeois media in Burma and Australia continue to criticize the US draft peace treaty with Japan and oppose the San Francisco Conference. An editorial in the "Burman" newspaper in Rangoon, Burma, on the 5th denounced the San Francisco Conference as "providing new cannon fodder for the war caused by the peace treaty with Japan." The editorial said: The San Francisco "conference is like a stage, on which a puppet show is being staged with someone pulling the strings behind the scenes." The editorial stated that Burma will do everything in its power "to strengthen Asia's call to oppose American colonialism."

Former President of the United Nations, former Australian Foreign Minister, and current leader of the Australian Labor Party, Evatt, issued a statement on the eve of the San Francisco Conference, pointing out: "The vast majority of Australians believe that the draft peace treaty with Japan threatens the territorial and economic security of the South Pacific and Southeast Asia. This draft openly and shamelessly abandons all standards of international justice." He also said: "Now, all the past tragedies will obviously be repeated: treaties are regarded like waste paper, Japan's inferior products will flood countries with higher living standards, and the zaibatsu and militarists will be rearmed, and soon they will be active again."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Tokyo: Truman's speech at the opening of the San Francisco Conference on the 4th aroused strong dissatisfaction even among conservative people in Japan. Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party, made a speech in Sendai on the 5th, vehemently criticizing Truman's speech. He said: Truman's speech confirmed the view that the US draft peace treaty with Japan would not return sovereignty to Japan. He pointed out that Truman believed that Japan's rearmament was a matter of course, which showed that "other countries" were making "major decisions" for the Japanese people. He further said that the US military stationed in Japan under the proposed "US-Japan Security Treaty" "will make it impossible for the Japanese people to be masters of their own destiny," and "these troops will have the power to direct the policies of the Japanese government." He also said that the continued presence of these foreign troops with extraterritorial rights in Japan shows that the US draft treaty only grants Japan sovereignty in form, but in reality "Japan's sovereignty is still restricted."

Suzuki Mosaburo pointed out that it is wrong to hope that the San Francisco Conference can produce conditions beneficial to Japan. He believes that the San Francisco Conference will "ruthlessly determine Japan's cruel fate." Suzuki said that Japan cannot reconcile with Asian countries such as China and India, and has become an "orphan of Asia." He therefore predicted that after the separate treaty is concluded, "Japan will fall into a miserable situation."

Suzuki also accused Truman of saying that "Japan's defense forces will be united with the defense forces of other countries in the Pacific region," which is to make Japan "obligated to participate in the war," "regardless of whether the people are willing or not."

    美国操纵旧金山会议通过“会议规则”
    引起一些亚洲与会国家代表的不满
    日本社会党领袖抨击旧金山会议将使日本陷于悲惨境地
    【新华社七日讯】旧金山消息：旧金山会议的会议规则，是美国事先片面制订，并胁迫一部分参加会议的国家接受的，以便美国操纵旧金山会议，阻碍苏联等国代表团在会上提出关于对日和约的正当主张。
    三日，美英两国片面召集法国、澳大利亚、菲律宾等其他九国举行“特别会议”，私自讨论美国所制订的关于旧金山会议的“规则和程序”，对此并获得“一般协议”。会后，美英两国将该“严格的会议规则草案”，向各国代表团散发并于四日公布。
    在旧金山会议第一日会议上，美国即强令会议通过这个专制的“会议规则”。这个“会议规则”把美国的霸道暴露无遗。规定：旧金山会议将“按照”美国在七月二十日发出的“邀请书的条件进行”，即：“和会是‘为了缔结及签署’美英和约而举行的”。会议规则专横地剥夺各国代表在会议上的发言权。规则规定，美英两国首先在会议发言后，其他代表团“可以发言，但无论如何不能超过一小时”，并且，“这些发言只应是关于目前这个对日和约（按指美制对日和约）的”。不仅如此，规则并规定：“在每一代表发言后，他要等到所有其他代表全部发言后才能再发言，而且要在会议决定准许再发什么言（如果准许发表的话）及在什么条件下发言时，他才能发言。”此外，又规定：“凡代表未事先经过主席认可者不得向会议发言。主席有权要求发言的人遵守规则，如果他不服从的话，主席可以取消他的认可，并让下一个人发言。”
    【新华社七日讯】美国代表艾奇逊在旧金山会议上所采取的蛮横无理的态度，引起一些亚洲国家代表的不满。合众社旧金山五日电承认：“参加和会的一些亚洲代表，对艾奇逊强迫第一次会议通过英国和美国拟订的议事规则时所采用的‘蒸汽碾路机’手段，表示不满。”有些“亚洲代表”担心美国这种专制的作法“对远东的一些地区的舆论有不良的影响”。合众社说，印尼代表对艾奇逊“骤然打消”苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的动议时所持的态度，“特别感到不安”。印尼对艾奇逊的“蒸汽碾路机”式的态度表示厌恶。印尼代表团在五日上午会议举行表决时，“几乎每次都弃权”。
    合众社又说：“巴基斯坦代表对英美的战术不完全满意”。
    【新华社七日讯】缅甸和澳大利亚的资产阶级舆论，继续抨击美国对日和约草案，反对旧金山会议。缅甸仰光的“缅人报”五日的社论斥责旧金山会议是“为了由对日和约引起的战争供给新的炮灰”。社论说：旧金山“会议宛如一座戏台，台上串演着一出有人在幕后拉线的亚洲傀儡舞剧。”社论表示：缅甸将尽其一切力量“以增强亚洲反对美国殖民主义的呼声”。
    前联合国主席、前澳大利亚外长、现任澳工党领袖伊瓦特，在旧金山会议前夕发表谈话指出：“绝大多数澳大利亚人都认为对日和约草案威胁着南太平洋和东南亚的领土和经济安全。这个草案公开无耻地背弃了一切国际正义的标准。”他又说：“现在，一切过去的悲剧显然将重演：条约被看得像废纸一般，日本的低劣的生产品将充斥于生活水准较高的各个国家，财阀和军国主义分子将再被武装起来，很快他们就要活跃起来了。”
    【新华社七日讯】东京消息：杜鲁门四日在旧金山会议开幕时发表的演说，甚至在日本保守的人士中也引起强烈的不满。日本社会党中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎五日在仙台发表谈话，猛烈抨击杜鲁门的演说。他说：杜鲁门的演说证实了认为美国对日和约草案不会把主权归还日本的看法。他指出：杜鲁门认为日本重新武装是理所当然的事，这就表明了“别的国家”在为日本人民作出“重大决定”。他进一步说：美国依据拟议中的“美日安全公约”在日本驻军，“将使日本人民不可能成为他们自己的命运的主人”，“这些军队将有力量指挥日本政府的政策。”他又说：这些具有治外法权的外国军队继续留驻日本，说明美国和约草案仅在形式上授予日本主权，实际上“日本的主权仍受限制”。
    铃木茂三郎指出：如果希望旧金山会议能产生对日本有益的条件，那是错误的。他认为：旧金山会议将“无情地决定日本的冷酷命运”。铃木说：日本不能和中国、印度等亚洲各国和解，就变成了“亚洲的孤儿”。他因此预言：单独和约缔结后，“日本将陷于悲惨的境遇中”。
    铃木同时指责杜鲁门所说的“日本防御力量将与太平洋地区其他国家的防御力量联合在一起”，是使日本“负有参加战争的义务”，“不问人民是否愿意”。
