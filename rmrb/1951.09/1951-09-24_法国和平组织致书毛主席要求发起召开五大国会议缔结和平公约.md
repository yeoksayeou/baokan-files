Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The Gironde Province Peace Committee and the Upper Garonne Province Peace Assembly in France sent letters to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government of China on June 28th and July 14th, requesting the initiation of a conference of the five major powers (China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) to conclude a peace pact.

    The appeal from the Gironde Province Peace Committee included 173 copies of meeting records from the first mass rallies of people in and around the French port of Bordeaux, which is occupied by the United States; a total of 6,946 people signed the records. The appeal stated: "Mr. Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China: These meeting records and the signatures on them demonstrate that our people agree with the World Peace Council's declaration advocating a peace pact among the five major powers, and also show that our people hope to see agreements between governments achieved through negotiations soon. We request you to notify your government of this matter and ask your government to initiate a conference of the five major powers."

    The appeal from the Upper Garonne Province Peace Assembly first recalled all the suffering that World War II and the Nazi occupation brought to France. The appeal then pointed out that Nazi Germany was defeated mainly due to the joint efforts of the people of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, who fought for independence, freedom, and lasting peace. However, the United Nations later failed to live up to the wishes of the people of all countries. Instead of establishing peace, it resorted to force to resolve the dispute in Korea. The appeal emphasized that it was the will of millions of people inspired and guided by the peace movement that prevented the use of atomic bombs through the Stockholm Declaration and put the Korean War on the path of armistice negotiations.

    The Garonne Province Peace Assembly is well aware that the future of peace is in the hands of the people. It has achieved many victories in the movement to support the Five-Power Conference and will continue to act until peace is completely victorious. The appeal finally made it clear that the French people resolutely reject a new war and deeply hope that the Five-Power Conference will be convened as soon as possible to negotiate peace in Korea and conclude a broad peace pact so that people around the world can make progress in peaceful competition.

    The Gironde Province Peace Committee and the Upper Garonne Province Peace Assembly also sent the same documents to the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as the French Prime Minister.

    法国和平组织致书毛主席要求发起召开五大国会议缔结和平公约
    【新华社二十二日讯】法国吉伦特省和平委员会和上加隆省和平大会，在六月二十八日和七月十四日曾致书毛主席和我国中央人民政府，要求发起召开中、苏、美、英、法五大国会议以缔结和平公约。
    吉伦特省和平委员会的呼吁书附有在美国强占下的法国港口波尔多及其近郊首批人民群众大会的会议记录一百七十三份；在记录上签名的共六千九百四十六人。呼吁书说：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席先生：这些会议记录及其上的签名，说明了我们人民同意世界和平理事会主张五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，同时也说明了我们人民希望很快看到各国用谈判的方式来取得各国政府之间的协议。我们请求你将此事通知贵国政府，并要求贵国政府发起召开五大国会议。”
    上加隆省和平大会的呼吁书首先追述了第二次世界大战和希特勒占领给法国带来的一切苦难。呼吁书接着指出：希特勒德国之所以被击败，主要归功于为独立自由和持久和平而战斗的中、苏、美、英、法等国人民的共同努力。但是，联合国在后来却辜负了各国人民的愿望。它不仅没有建立和平，反而采取武力去解决在朝鲜的争执。呼吁书强调说：正是那些受和平运动启示和指导的千百万人民的意志，通过了斯德哥尔摩宣言阻止了原子弹的使用，并使朝鲜战争走上停战谈判的道路。
    加隆省和平大会深知和平的前途掌握在人民手里，它在拥护五大国会议的运动中已获得许多胜利，今后还要继续行动，一直到和平完全胜利为止。呼吁书最后明确表示：法国人民坚决拒绝新战争，深望五大国会议从速召开，以便谈判朝鲜的和平与缔结广泛的和平公约，使全世界人民能在和平竞赛中进步。
    吉伦特省和平委员会和上加隆省和平大会并以同样的文件分送苏、美、英三国大使和法国总理。
