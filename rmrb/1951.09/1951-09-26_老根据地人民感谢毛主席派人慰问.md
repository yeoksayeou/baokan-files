To the Respected Chairman Mao: A Report to Chairman Mao from the People of Shangyou County, Jiangxi Province, on Their Heroic Struggle History

    The delegation representing you to visit the people of the old revolutionary base areas arrived in Shangyou on August 31st. They conveyed your cordial greetings to us and brought your portrait and inscription. We are deeply moved and do not know how to express our gratitude for your concern.

    In 1930, 1931, and 1932, under your education and leadership, the people of Shangyou, closely united, launched a vigorous revolutionary movement to fight for freedom and liberation. We used shotguns, crude cannons, and spears to eliminate local reactionary armed forces, overthrowing the feudal rule of thousands of years and the criminal rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and establishing a red regime. The red flag of revolution fluttered over the land of freedom, and the people began to live a happy and fulfilling life.

    After you led the main force of the Red Army north to resist Japan, the reactionary bandit troops of Chiang Kai-shek and Yu Hanmou, along with some fleeing landlords, launched a frantic "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the revolutionary base areas. They put forward the murderous slogan of "rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one go," treating our revolutionary people with inhuman means such as mass shootings and disembowelment. The number of revolutionary cadres and masses who were massacred was approximately 2,200. The executioner, Zeng Guohua (who has been brought to justice), even dug out the hearts and livers of the murdered revolutionary comrades and ate them in public.

    However, the revolutionary people's will to fight was not intimidated by the reactionaries' brutality. Gu Dapei, the commander of the 43rd Regiment, led his brave soldiers and local Red Guards in a fierce street battle with the enemy in Yingqianwei, annihilating an enemy regiment. Commander Gu Dapei gloriously sacrificed himself in this battle. Zhang Rongqing, the chairman of the Jiangkou Township government, led the Hexi Red Guards in a three-day and two-night melee with the enemy on Tieshi Ridge in Jiangkouwei, and three times charged into the enemy's regimental headquarters in Jiangkouwei, seizing the enemy's machine guns. After the battle, many Red Guard soldiers were found on Tieshi Ridge, dead with their hands still clutching the enemy's throats. For twenty years, our guerrillas have been waging an unyielding struggle against the reactionaries, hoping for your troops to return soon.

    In August 1949, the glorious day arrived. On the morning of August 16th, the People's Liberation Army entered Shangyou County. Millions of people cheered: "Dawn has broken, Chairman Mao's troops have returned!" The masses, seeing your portrait, shouted "Long live!" The masses also formed committees to support the front lines, assisting the army in liberating the great southwest. At that time, Fang Yekui, a reactionary ringleader who was ignorant of the situation, led a portion of the reactionary armed forces to Guazi Mountain, attempting to resist stubbornly. As a result, in just one night, he was surrounded and captured alive by our county brigade and local people. This victory gave the people of the entire county great encouragement.

    In the two years since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we have eliminated bandits and spies within our borders, and completed tasks such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and the suppression of local bullies. Land reform has been implemented in more than half of the areas, and the land that had been plundered by the feudal landlord class for thousands of years is now our own. Due to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the implementation of land reform, the enthusiasm of the county's peasants for production has been unprecedentedly high. This year's early rice harvest was a bumper one, with a yield increase of 15 to 20 percent compared to before liberation, exceeding the original plan of an 8 to 10 percent increase. After this year's summer harvest, we also overcame a drought that affected more than 28,000 mu of land. Due to the liberation of rural productive forces in our county, the bumper harvest of agricultural production, and the smooth sales of local products such as tungsten ore, wood, bamboo, iron, and paper, the severe famines that occurred every spring and summer have been eliminated. We believe that our lives will get better and better under your leadership.

    However, we deeply know that American imperialism is unwilling to see the Chinese people stand up. It wants to undermine the construction of the new China, destroy the happy lives of our liberated people, and disrupt world peace. We must listen to your instructions, respond to your call, actively increase production, donate airplanes and cannons, strengthen our national defense, consolidate our victory, support the just struggle of the Korean people, and defend world peace. We will definitely strive for greater glory with practical actions!

    With highest respect!

    The entire people of the old revolutionary base area of Shangyou County, Jiangxi Province, respectfully

    The People of Wubu County, Shaanxi Province, Report to Chairman Mao on Anti-American and Aid-Korea Work

Dear Chairman Mao:

    You lived in the old liberated area of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia for fourteen years. Under your long-term leadership and education, we have stood up, lived a good life, and embarked on the road to a life of plenty. We will never forget the benefits this has brought us. We fully believe that under your wise and correct leadership and the leadership of the Party, we will be able to defeat all enemies and overcome all difficulties, and our motherland will surely prosper and become strong.

    Just when our people across the country are responding to your call and working hard to build our great motherland, the heinous American imperialism is once again invading us. We firmly refuse to allow this. In order to defend the security of the motherland and world peace, we actively respond to the call of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Federation, universally establish patriotic covenants, launch patriotic production competitions, and, on the basis of increasing grain production and increasing income, launch donation campaigns, using all our strength to support the Korean front and strive to defeat the aggression of American imperialism as soon as possible. We must also strengthen public security work to prevent sabotage by secret agents, bandits, and all counter-revolutionary elements.

Wishing you good health!

    The entire people of Wubu County, Shaanxi Province

    Labor Model Yang Fengshan of Shanxi Province Dedicates Production Achievements to Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao:

    I was extremely happy to hear that you sent a delegation to visit us in the old revolutionary base area. On August 21st, the delegation came to Pingshun, and I was selected as a representative to participate in the forum. I warmly shook hands with the comrades of the delegation and talked about many heartfelt thoughts.

    You personally wrote the inscription calling on us to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." I want to turn your call into practical action.

    The happiest event in my life was that at this forum with the visiting delegation, I was selected as the representative of Pingshun County to attend the National Day celebration in Beijing on October 1st this year. Being able to see you in Beijing is my supreme honor.

    I want to bring you some gifts when I go to Beijing this time. I thought about it, should I bring some Codonopsis pilosula, peppercorns, or walnuts? But they are not easy to carry. Finally, I decided to focus on doing a good job in autumn production and increasing donations as a gift to you. On September 1st, I led the entire team to set a short-term plan of twenty days, and we will strive to complete it before going to Beijing. The content of the plan is: 1. Formulate the team's autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing work plan, and launch a competition with the sixteen teams in the entire village; 2. Conduct a review and revision of the team's patriotic covenant and conduct an evaluation and summary after the autumn harvest; 3. Review the six-month donation plan. The original plan was to increase production by 15 shi and 2 dou, but we have already completed 20 shi and 5 dou. We will actively convert this into cash and pay 250,000 yuan in advance, and the remaining 185,000 yuan will be paid off by the end of the year; 4. Seventeen male laborers and fourteen female laborers will complete the harvesting of 40,000 jin of Artemisia scoparia and finish digging up all the Codonopsis pilosula; 5. Hold a forum for military dependents and a forum for team members to solicit everyone's opinions and ensure that the work of farming on behalf of military families is done well.

    We are determined to complete the above plan and summarize it before our departure on September 20th, bringing this achievement to Beijing as our gift!

Wishing you eternal good health!

    Representatives of All Sectors of Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, Report Production Plans to Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao:

    The delegation you sent came to Wuxiang in August. The comrades of the delegation brought the banner with your handwritten inscription "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," giving us guidance on the road to continued progress. All the people of Wuxiang County will never forget your kindness. We represent the 150,000 people of Wuxiang County and extend our highest respect to you! Wishing you good health!

    Our Ninth People's Representative Conference of All Sectors in Wuxiang County has concluded. During the conference, we listened to the government's work report and, based on the instructions from higher authorities and the demands of the broad masses of the people, decided on the following important tasks: (1) In order to meet the needs of the country's industrial construction and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, we must vigorously promote cotton planting among the masses, and plan to expand cotton fields by at least 15,000 mu in 1952. The county's agricultural production must ensure deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, with sufficient fertilizer application, to achieve a bumper harvest. We must do a good job in seed selection, autumn plowing, and fertilizer accumulation this autumn, laying a favorable foundation for next year's large-scale production. (2) Continue to respond to the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Federation's three major calls, do a good job in preferential treatment for military dependents, and educate young people to respond to the country's call at any time. Universally review and revise patriotic covenants to ensure they are implemented well and not left empty. Continue to carry out patriotic donations. (3) Universally repair all roads, large and small, throughout the county to facilitate transportation and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. (4) In order to consolidate national defense and develop economic construction, mobilize the masses to actively pay patriotic public grain, and ensure that the task of paying agricultural taxes is 100% completed this year.

    We guarantee that we will conscientiously implement the above four resolutions among the masses and turn them into practical actions by the masses in order to respond to your concern for us.

    With revolutionary respect!

    People's Representative Conference of All Sectors of Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province

### 老根据地人民感谢毛主席派人慰问

    老根据地人民感谢毛主席派人慰问
    江西省上犹县人民向毛主席报告英勇斗争历史敬爱的毛主席：
    代表你访问老革命根据地人民的代表团，于八月三十一日来到上犹。他们向我们进行了亲切的慰问，并带来了你的像片和题字。我们非常感动，我们不知怎样才能回答你对我们的关怀。
    一九三○年和一九三一、一九三二年，上犹人民在你的教育领导下，为争取自由解放，紧密地团结起来，掀起了轰轰烈烈的革命运动。我们用鸟枪、土炮、梭标消灭了地方反动武装，推翻了数千年来的封建统治与国民党反动派的罪恶统治，建立了红色政权。革命的红旗飘扬在自由的土地上，人民开始过着幸福美满的生活。
    自从你领导主力红军北上抗日以后，蒋匪介石、余匪汉谋的反动匪军，率领一些逃亡地主，向革命根据地实行了疯狂的“进剿”。他们提出“宁可错杀一千，不可放走一个”的杀人口号，用集体枪杀，开膛破肚的灭绝人性的手段，对待我们革命人民。被残杀的革命干部和群众约二千二百余人。杀人刽子手曾国华（已伏法）竟把被杀的革命同志的心肝挖出，当众吃掉。
    然而，革命人民的斗争意志并没有被反动派那种兽行所吓倒。四十三团古达培团长率领全团勇士和地方赤卫队，在营前圩和敌人进行激烈的巷战，消灭了敌人一个团。古达培团长在这次战斗中光荣牺牲了。江口乡政府主席张荣卿，率领河西赤卫队在江口圩的铁狮岭和敌人进行了三天两夜的肉搏战，并曾三次冲进江口圩敌人团部，夺取了敌人的机关枪。战后的铁狮岭山上，发现许多赤卫队战士扼住敌人的咽喉死在一起。二十年来，我们的游击队一直和反动派进行不屈不挠的斗争，盼望你的队伍早日回来。
    一九四九年八月，光辉的日子来到了。八月十六日早晨，人民解放军进入上犹县城。千万群众在欢呼：“天亮了，毛主席的队伍回来了！”群众看到你的像片，高呼万岁。群众并分头成立支援前线委员会，支援大军解放大西南。当时，不知死活的反动头子方匪业奎，曾率领一部分反动武装上了挂子山，妄图负隅顽抗。结果，只一夜工夫，便被我们的县大队及当地群众包围活捉了。这一个胜利又给了全县人民以很大的鼓舞。
    解放后二年来，在党和人民政府的正确领导下，我们肃清了境内的土匪，特务，完成了减租减息、反恶霸等工作。半数以上的地区实行了土地改革，数千年被封建地主阶级剥削抢去的土地，现在成为我们自己的了。由于镇压了反革命分子，进行了土地改革，全县农民的生产积极性空前提高了。今年的早稻大丰收，较解放前增产百分之十五至二十，超过了原订增产百分之八至十的计划。今年夏收后，我们又战胜了面积达二万八千多亩的旱灾。由于我县农村生产力的解放，农业生产的丰收及钨砂、木、竹、铁、纸等土产的销路畅通，消除了历年春夏二季间的严重饥荒。我们相信，我们的生活在你领导下，将会一天一天更加好起来。
    但是，我们深深知道，美帝国主义是不愿中国人民站起来的，它要破坏新中国的建设，破坏我们翻身人民的幸福生活，破坏世界和平。我们一定听从你的指示，响应你的号召，积极增产，捐献飞机大炮，加强我们的国防，巩固我们的胜利，支援朝鲜人民的正义斗争，保卫世界和平。我们一定以实际行动争取更大的光荣！此致崇高敬礼！
    江西省上犹县老革命根据地全体人民谨上
    陕西省吴堡县人民向毛主席报告抗美援朝工作亲爱的毛主席：
    你在陕甘宁老解放区住了十四年，我们在你的长期领导和教育之下，翻了身，过上了好光景，走上了丰衣足食的道路。这给我们的好处，我们永远不会忘记。我们完全相信，在你和党的英明正确领导下，我们能够战胜一切敌人，克服一切困难，我们的祖国一定能繁荣富强起来。
    当我们全国人民正在响应你的号召，努力建设我们伟大祖国的时候，万恶的美帝国主义，又来侵略我们，我们是坚决不答应的。为了保卫祖国的安全及世界和平，我们积极响应抗美援朝总会的号召，普遍订立爱国公约，展开爱国主义的生产竞赛，在增产粮食，增加收入的基础上，展开捐献运动，用一切力量支援朝鲜前线，争取早日打败美帝国主义的侵略。我们并要加强治安工作，防止特务匪徒和一切反革命分子的捣乱破坏。敬祝你的身体健康！

    山西省劳动模范杨峰山用生产成绩献给毛主席敬爱的毛主席：
    听到你派访问团来老根据地访问我们，我心里有说不出来的高兴。八月二十一日，访问团来到平顺，我被选为代表，参加了座谈会。我和访问团同志亲切地握了手，座谈了很多心思话。
    你亲笔题字号召我们：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”我要把你的号召变成实际行动。
    我有生以来最大的一件喜事，是我这次在访问团座谈会上，被选为平顺县出席北京今年十月一日国庆节观礼的代表。能到北京见见您，是我无尚的光荣。
    我这次到北京，要给你带些礼物。我左思右想，带些党参、花椒、核桃吧？都不好带。最后决定还是做好秋季生产与增产捐献，作为给你的献礼。我于九月一日领导全组订了一个二十天短期计划，未去北京前要努力完成它。计划的内容是：一、订出全组秋收、秋耕、秋种工作计划，并向全村十六个组开展竞赛；二、全组爱国公约检查修订一次，秋后评判总结；三、检查半年捐献计划，原计划增产十五石二斗，现已完成二十石零五斗，积极变款，提前交款二十五万元，下余十八万五千元年底交齐。四、十七个男劳力，十四个女劳力，完成割蒿四万斤，刨完地蔓党参。五、召开一次军属座谈会与组员座谈会，征求大家的意见，保证把代耕工作作好。
    我们要决心完成以上计划，到九月二十号出发前总结完，把这个成绩带到北京作为我们的献礼！祝你身体永远健康！		山西省平顺县第六区界畔峧全省劳动模范  杨峰山
