Title: The U.S. Side Goes Back on Its Word, Obviously Lacking Sincerity for Peace Negotiations. The Liaison Officers' Meeting Scheduled for Yesterday Morning Was Abruptly Cancelled by the U.S. Side. The U.S. Scheme is to Delay the Armistice Negotiations Until After the Sixth UN General Assembly Convenes in Order to Arbitrarily Handle a Series of Issues Concerning China and the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 27th. This reporter learned from relevant sources that the meeting between liaison officers of both sides, originally scheduled for 10:00 this morning, was suddenly cancelled by the other side at the last minute. The other side's personnel, including reporters, totaled thirty-six, who arrived in Kaesong after 9:30 this morning in five jeeps and two trucks. However, at 9:55, Colonel Kenney, the other side's liaison officer, suddenly notified Colonel Zhang of our side by radio telephone, claiming: "Due to circumstances beyond my control, I cannot arrive in Kaesong in time to attend the 10 o'clock meeting." The more than thirty personnel on the other side then inexplicably returned to Munsan. Observers here pointed out that this capricious behavior on the part of the United Nations forces, is similar to the unpredictable behavior of the United Nations forces on September 22nd, when they decided to send over important documents but then notified us of the cancellation. This strange action not only shows that the U.S. side clearly lacks sincerity and a serious attitude towards peace negotiations, but also indicates that there are certain differences between Tokyo and Washington in playing new tricks to delay negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th. After creating a series of provocative incidents to force the Kaesong armistice negotiations to stall for more than a month, the U.S. side is now continuing to adopt tactics to obstruct the resumption of armistice negotiations in order to maintain the tense situation in Korea, so as to benefit its arbitrary handling of a series of issues concerning China and the Far East at the Sixth United Nations General Assembly, which will open in early November. This U.S. conspiracy has been revealed by the New York "Compass Daily". The newspaper published a special article by I. F. Stone on September 23, stating that UN General Assembly President Padilla Nervo and UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, driven by the United States, are trying to "avoid reopening the debate in the United Nations on allowing Communist China to join the United Nations." The "danger" that Padilla Nervo is taking is that the Fifth United Nations General Assembly, which is still technically in progress, "may cause a major debate on the China issue, delaying the end of the Fifth General Assembly and the opening of the Sixth General Assembly in Chaillot, Paris." Stone pointed out: "If an armistice is obtained in Korea before November 6, then the U.S. claim that China is trying to 'shoot its way into' the United Nations will no longer be valid. Therefore, armistice negotiations may be delayed until the Sixth General Assembly is already in progress."

    美方出尔反尔对和平谈判显然缺乏诚意
    原定昨晨举行的联络官会谈突被美方取消
    美方阴谋把停战谈判拖延到六届联大开会以后
    以便专横地处理中国和远东方面的一系列问题
    【新华社开城二十七日电】记者自有关方面获悉：原定于今晨十时举行的双方联络官的会谈，突然被对方临时取消。对方人员包括记者在内共三十六人，在今晨九时半后分乘吉普车五辆卡车二辆来到开城。但至九时五十五分，对方联络官肯尼上校突以无线电话通知我方张上校，竟称：“由于我所不能控制的环境，我不能及时到达开城参加十点钟的会议。”对方人员三十余人均即莫名其妙地折返汶山。联合国军方面这种出尔反尔的儿戏行为，与九月二十二日联合国军方面决定送来重要文件忽又通知取消的变幻莫测的行为，如出一辙。此间观察家指出：这种奇异的行动，不仅表示美国方面对于和平谈判显然缺乏诚意和郑重态度，而且表示东京与华盛顿间在玩弄拖延谈判的新花样上，存有某种分歧。
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国方面在制造一连串挑衅事件迫使开城停战谈判停顿了一个多月之后，现在仍继续采取阻挠停战谈判恢复的战术来保持朝鲜的紧张局面，以利于它在十一月初开幕的第六届联合国大会上专横地处理中国和远东方面的一系列问题。美国方面的这一阴谋，已为纽约“指南针日报”所揭露。该报于九月二十三日发表的艾德尔的专文称：由美国所驱策的联合国大会主席安迪让和联大秘书长赖伊正力图“避免在联合国中重新展开关于准许共产党中国加入联合国的辩论”。安迪让所冒的“危险”是：迄今在技术上还在进行的第五届联合国大会“可能引起中国问题的大辩论，以致拖延第五届大会的结束和第六届大会在巴黎查禄的开幕”。艾德尔指出：“如果在十一月六日以前朝鲜获得停战，那末美国认为中国是在设法‘杀进’联合国的说法，就会不再发生效力。因此，停战谈判有可能会拖延下去，直到第六届大会已经在进行的时候。”
