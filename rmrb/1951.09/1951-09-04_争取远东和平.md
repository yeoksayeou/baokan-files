Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 3rd: The "Zhenli Bao" [Truth Daily] published an editorial entitled "Striving for Peace in the Far East." The editorial stated: Peace-loving people of all countries are commemorating the sixth anniversary of defeating the Japanese invading forces and liberating East Asia from the shackles of Japanese imperialism.

	On September 2, 1945, representatives of the Japanese state and military headquarters signed the instrument of unconditional surrender. Imperialist Japan, having been thoroughly defeated at sea and on land, laid down its arms and surrendered. The war of the Soviet people and our allies against Japanese imperialism – which, together with fascist Germany, launched the Second World War – thus ended victoriously.

	The aggressive Japanese imperialists had greatly endangered the cause of peace in the Far East. For many years, the Japanese samurai had carried out plunder in China and other Asian countries. Japanese aggressors also caused serious damage to our country. As early as the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese imperialists took advantage of the failures of Tsarist Russia to seize the southern part of Sakhalin Island, occupy the Kuril Islands, and block all of our country's eastern outlets to the ocean, as well as all export routes to the ports of Soviet Kamchatka and the Chukotka Peninsula. In the early years after the October Revolution and in later periods, Japanese imperialists tried to divide the territory of our Far East. The defeat of imperialist Japan during World War II was a fatal blow to the predatory conspiracies of Japanese imperialists.

	The heroic Soviet people played a decisive role in defeating the Japanese invading forces. The historic victory of the Soviet Union over Hitlerite Germany predetermined the inevitable defeat of Japanese imperialism, and the active fighting of the Soviet army, air force, and navy ensured the rapid defeat of Japan. The victory over Japan marked the end of World War II.

	Today's telegram from Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to Comrade Stalin expresses the gratitude of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the Chinese people for the enormous assistance given by the Soviet Union to the Chinese people during the War of Resistance Against Japan. This telegram highly evaluated the role played by the Soviet Union and its army in the cause of defeating the Japanese aggressor forces.

	In his reply telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman Stalin of the Soviet Council of Ministers thanked him for his high evaluation of the role of the Soviet Union and its army in the cause of defeating the Japanese aggressor forces. Comrade Stalin said: "The Chinese people and their Liberation Army, despite the conspiracies of the Kuomintang, played a great role in the cause of eliminating Japanese imperialists. The struggle of the Chinese people and their Liberation Army greatly facilitated the cause of defeating the Japanese aggressor forces. There is no doubt that the indestructible friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is now and will be in the future for the cause of guaranteeing peace in the Far East and opposing all aggressors and warmongers." On this sixth anniversary of East Asia's liberation from Japanese imperialist enslavement, Comrade Stalin, on behalf of the Soviet Union and its army, extended his congratulations.

	On the eve of the Second World War, two breeding grounds of world fascism and world aggression took shape: Germany in the West and Japan in the East. These aggressive forces, with the direct help of international reactionaries, launched the Second World War, nearly destroying mankind and civilization.

	The peace-loving people of all countries, led by the Soviet Union, rose up and fought against the fascist aggressors. As a result of the struggle, the breeding grounds of world aggression and world fascism were destroyed. The victory over fascist Germany and imperialist Japan created the necessary conditions for world peace.

	The conferences held by the major powers in Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam successively defined the basic principles for establishing a solid and lasting peace. The Soviet Union strictly abides by these international agreements, and has consistently and unremittingly struggled for the demilitarization and democratization of Germany and Japan, and for world peace.

	The policies implemented by the reactionary ruling groups of Western countries are completely different. They have adopted a policy of reviving German and Japanese imperialism. This policy violates the basic and vital interests of the people of all countries and has aroused the unanimous condemnation and opposition of peaceful and democratic forces.

	The people of all countries around the world are fighting for a lasting and solid peace. They do not want the breeding grounds of aggression and fascism to be restored. The Chinese people and other Asian countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression are persistently fighting to realize the Potsdam Declaration – the Potsdam Declaration stipulates that Japan be transformed into a peace-loving, independent, and democratic country.

	The indestructible friendship between the great people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China plays a great role in accomplishing this task. This friendship is conducive to the cause of defending the peace and security of the people of the Far East, all of Asia, and the Pacific countries. Its purpose is to eliminate the threat of the revival of Japanese aggression and to establish a lasting democratic peace. This friendship opposes all aggressors and warmongers, and it is itself an indestructible force for maintaining world peace.

	The people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other peace-loving countries have a firm will and are determined to defend and strengthen peace and to prevent the revival of vengeful Japanese militarism.

	The telegram from Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to Stalin said: "The great assistance given by the Soviet Union to the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the solid alliance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China on jointly preventing the resurgence of Japanese aggression forces, have infinitely encouraged the Chinese people in the struggle against aggression forces in the Far East."

	The struggle to achieve a democratic and peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue is in line with the vital interests of the broad masses of people who are striving to defend and consolidate peace. The Japanese issue should be resolved justly, and Japan should be transformed into a peace-loving and democratic country. This is what the Japanese people deeply care about. The Japanese working people have expressed their desire for peace and their protest against the United States turning Japan into a springboard for aggression with the signatures of millions upon millions on the declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact and on the demand for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

	The common struggle of the Soviet and Chinese people for peace is a source of inspiration for hundreds of millions of peace advocates who are working to eliminate the threat of Japanese aggression.

	The fraternal friendship between the peace-loving people of the Soviet Union and China is growing stronger day by day. This great friendship is helping and will help to defend the cause of world peace.

	Long live the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union!

    争取远东和平
    真理报社论
     【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日电：真理报以“争取远东和平”为题发表社论。社论说：爱好和平的各国人民都在纪念击溃日本侵略军队和把东亚从日本帝国主义桎梏下解放出来的第六周年。
    一九四五年九月二日，日本国家与军部的代表在无条件投降书上签字。帝国主义日本在海上与陆上被澈底击溃之后，即放下武器投降。苏联人民与我们的盟国对日本帝国主义——它与法西斯德国共同发动第二次世界大战——所进行的战争于是胜利结束。
    侵略成性的日本帝国主义者曾使远东的和平事业受到很大的危害。许多年来，日本的武士们在中国及亚洲其他国家进行掠夺。日本侵略者使我国也受到严重的损害。早在俄日战争时期，日本帝国主义者就利用沙皇俄国的失败，夺取了库页岛南部，侵占了千岛群岛，封锁了我国东部通往海洋的一切出口以及通往苏联堪察加与楚科特卡半岛各口岸的一切出口途径。在十月革命以后的最初数年以及后来的时期，日本帝国主义者又想分割我国远东的领土。第二次世界大战期间帝国主义日本被击溃了，这是对日本帝国主义者掠夺阴谋的致命打击。
    英雄的苏联人民在击溃日本侵略军队上起了决定性的作用。苏联战胜希特勒德国的历史性胜利，预定了日本帝国主义的必然失败，而苏联的陆军、空军与海军的积极战斗也保证了迅速击溃日本帝国。对日胜利表示了第二次世界大战的结束。
    今日发表的中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席致斯大林同志的电报，表示了中国人民解放军和全中国人民对苏联在抗日战争中给予中国人民的巨大援助的感谢。这封电报对苏联及其军队在击溃日本侵略力量的事业中所起的作用作了崇高的估价。
    苏联部长会议主席斯大林在致毛泽东同志的复电中感谢他对苏联及其军队在击溃日本侵略力量的事业中的作用之崇高的估价。斯大林同志说：“中国人民及其解放军不顾国民党的阴谋，在消灭日本帝国主义者的事业中起了巨大的作用。中国人民及其解放军的斗争，大大地便利了击溃日本侵略力量的事业。无庸置疑，苏联和中华人民共和国的不可摧毁的友谊，在现在和将来都是为着保证远东和平，反对一切侵略者及战争贩子的事业的。”斯大林同志在这东亚从日本帝国主义奴役下获得解放的六周年，代表苏联及其军队表示祝贺。
    在第二次世界大战前夕形成了世界法西斯主义和世界侵略的两个温床：在西方是德国，在东方是日本。这些侵略力量在国际反动派的直接帮助下发动了第二次世界大战，使人类和文明几遭毁灭。
    以苏联为首的爱好和平的各国人民奋起和法西斯侵略者斗争，斗争的结果是世界侵略和世界法西斯主义的温床都被摧毁了。战胜法西斯德国和帝国主义日本，为世界和平造成了必要前提。
    各大国先后在德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨坦举行的会议，确定了建立巩固而持久的和平的基本原则。苏联严格地遵守着这些国际协定，一贯坚持不懈地为实现德日两国的非军国主义化和民主化、为世界和平而斗争。
    西方国家反动统治集团所施行的政策是和这完全不同的，他们采取了复活德日帝国主义的方针。这种政策违反世界各国人民的基本切身利益，引起了和平民主力量的一致谴责和反对。
    全世界各国的人民，都在进行斗争，争取持久而巩固的和平。他们不愿让侵略和法西斯主义的温床恢复起来。中国人民和其他受过日本侵略的灾祸的亚洲国家，正在坚持不懈地进行斗争，争取实现波茨坦宣言——波茨坦宣言规定把日本改造成为爱好和平的独立和民主的国家。
    苏联和中华人民共和国两国的伟大人民的不可摧毁的友谊，在完成这种任务的事业中，起了巨大的作用。这种友谊有利于保卫远东、全亚洲和太平洋各国人民的和平与安全的事业。它的目的是要消除日本侵略复活的威胁，确立持久的民主和平。这种友谊反对一切侵略者和战争贩子，它本身就是维护世界和平的不可摧毁的力量。
    苏联、中华人民共和国及其他爱好和平的国家的人民具有坚定的意志，决心保卫和加强和平，制止企图复仇的日本军国主义的复活。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席给斯大林的电报说：“苏联在抗日战争中给予中国人民的巨大援助，以及苏联和中华人民共和国关于共同防止日本侵略势力再起的巩固同盟，使中国人民在反对远东侵略势力的斗争中，获得无限鼓舞。”
    争取日本问题的民主和平解决的斗争是符合为保卫及巩固和平而努力的广大人民群众的切身利益的。日本问题应该公正地解决，日本应该改造为爱好和平的民主国家，这是日本人民所深切关怀的事。日本劳动人民以千千万万在要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言上的签名及要求缔结全面对日和约的签名，来表示他们对和平的意愿，以及对美国把日本变为侵略跳板的抗议。
    苏联和中国人民为争取和平而进行的共同斗争，对亿万为消除日本侵略威胁而努力的和平拥护者是鼓舞的源泉。
    苏中两国爱好和平的人民的兄弟友谊在一天天壮大。这伟大的友谊正在帮助将来也将帮助保卫世界和平的事业。
    中华人民共和国与苏联的伟大的友谊万岁！
