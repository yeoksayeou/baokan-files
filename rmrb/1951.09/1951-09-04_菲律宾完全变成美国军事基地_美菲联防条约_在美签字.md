Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 2nd: According to TASS, Washington, September 1st: The United States and the Philippines signed the so-called "US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty" in Washington on August 30th. Both Truman and Quirino were present.

In their speeches, Truman and Quirino attempted to portray this treaty as one that guarantees "the security and peace of the Pacific," claiming that neither side had "aggressive intentions," and so on.

According to the US State Department, this treaty between the United States and the Philippines is the beginning of a series of treaties aimed at establishing a Far Eastern aggressive alliance presided over by the United States.

This new US-Philippines treaty definitively turns the Philippines into an American military base. In his speech at the signing, Acheson once again mentioned other treaties previously imposed on the Filipino people; those treaties give the United States the right to maintain military bases in the Philippines, station troops at the bases, and send military advisory groups to be stationed in the country.

    菲律宾完全变成美国军事基地
    “美菲联防条约”在美签字
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿一日电：美国和菲律宾于八月三十日在华盛顿签署了所谓“美菲联防条约”。杜鲁门和季里诺都到场。
    杜鲁门和季里诺在演说中企图把这条约说成是一个保证“太平洋的安全与和平”的条约，说什么双方都没有“侵略目的”等等。
    按照美国国务院的意思：这个美国与菲律宾间的条约是一系列条约的开端，那些条约的目的是要建立一个由美国主持的远东侵略同盟。
    这个新的美菲条约最后地把菲律宾变为美国的军事基地。艾奇逊在签约时发表的演说中，再一次提到以前美国强加在菲律宾人民头上的其他条约；那些条约使美国有权在菲律宾保持军事基地、在基地上驻军和派遣军事顾问团驻在该国。
