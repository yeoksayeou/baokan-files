    Demanding the Abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty
    Egyptian People Demonstrate Against Imperialism
   [Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 29th] Several thousand workers, students, and citizens in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, held an anti-imperialist demonstration on August 26th (the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty), demanding the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. When the demonstrating masses passed in front of the British and American embassies, they shouted slogans such as "Oppose Imperialism," "Down with America," "Down with Britain," and "Abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty." The police fired at the demonstrating masses in an attempt to disperse them, and several people were seriously injured.
    According to Reuters: Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas announced on the 23rd that Egypt had decided to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Note: The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty signed in 1936 stipulated that Britain had the right to station troops in the Suez Canal for 20 years; Britain could use the ports of Alexandria and Port Said; in the event of war, British troops could pass through Egyptian territory; and Britain and Egypt would "jointly" administer Sudan.

    埃及人民示威反帝
   【新华社二十九日讯】开罗讯：埃及首都开罗的工人、学生和市民数千人，于八月二十六日（英埃条约签订十五周年纪念日）举行反对帝国主义的示威游行，要求废除英埃条约。示威群众走过英、美两国大使馆门口时高呼“反对帝国主义”、“打倒美国”、“打倒英国”、“废除英埃条约”等口号。警察向示威群众开枪，企图驱散示威队伍，有数人受重伤。
    据路透社消息：埃及首相纳哈斯已于二十三日宣布：埃及决定废除英埃条约。按：一九三六年签订的英埃条约规定：英国有权在苏彝士运河驻兵二十年；英国可以使用亚历山大港和塞得港；在发生战争时，英军可以经过埃境；英国与埃及“共同”管理苏丹。
