Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: The United States' violent and barbarous attitude in trying to force countries to sign the Japanese Peace Treaty, and the dissatisfaction of people from all countries, especially the people of Asia, which has resulted from this, has even caused those British bourgeois newspapers that originally blindly supported the United States to begin to express anxiety recently.

According to a dispatch from the British United Press in London on the 4th, the "Manchester Guardian" published an editorial saying: The United States' intention is that the representatives of the participating countries "must not discuss the Anglo-American draft treaty, but only sign it in a purely formal ceremony lasting four days. It seems surprising that the US State Department thinks that this can bind the representatives of 51 countries and force them to submit." The newspaper believes that this will subject the United States to accusations of "the United States' indifference to the dignity of small countries." The newspaper also said: The Soviet Union's acceptance of the invitation to participate in the conference "has disrupted the US plan. Therefore, the Soviet Union has already achieved a diplomatic victory before the conference has even begun."

The "Times" also expressed extreme displeasure with the clumsiness of the United States. The newspaper said: The US State Department does not want to hold a conference; it only wants a ceremony. "In this ceremony, nothing else is needed except golden pens, Louis XVI-style tables, photographers, and timely and appropriate grand speeches." It also said: "It would be extremely unfortunate if the Western countries were seen as trying to prevent the delegations of Asian countries from expressing their opinions, or intentionally using the veto power to forcibly suppress reasonable and appropriate discussions."

    美图强制各国在旧金山会议上签字
    英资产阶级报纸亦表焦虑
    【新华社五日讯】美国力图使各国在对日和约上签字划押的狂暴横蛮的态度，以及由此而引起的各国人民特别是亚洲人民的不满，甚至连那些原先一味为美国捧场的英国资产阶级报纸，最近也开始表示焦虑。
    据电通社伦敦四日电，“曼彻斯特卫报”发表社论说：美国的意思是，参加会议的各国代表们“不得讨论英美和约草案，仅得在四天的纯粹形式化的仪式中签字画押而已。美国国务院竟认为这样就可以约束五十一国的代表而使他们就范，这似乎令人惊异”。该报认为这将使美国遭受“美国漠然不顾小国尊严”的指责。该报又说：苏联接受参加会议的邀请，“已使美国计划陷于混乱。所以苏联在会议尚未开始前，就已经取得了一种外交上的胜利”。
        “泰晤士报”也对美国的笨拙极表不快。该报说：美国国务院并不愿举行会议，它所要的只是一种仪式而已。“在这种仪式中不需要别的，只需要金笔、路易十六式的桌子、摄影记者以及应时应景的冠冕堂皇的演说而已”它又说：“如果西方国家使别人看出来是在设法制止亚洲各国代表团表示意见，或对于合理而适切的议论有意强行使用否决权，那就极其不幸了。”
