    Actively Prepare to Welcome National Day

    (I) Editor Comrade:

    Our school's faculty, students, and staff are welcoming the great National Day with unparalleled joy. Now, we will tell you about our preparations.

    On September 22nd, the school administration, various democratic parties, the labor union, and the student union jointly formed a National Day Preparatory Committee, quickly formulated a plan, and began work. The students' parade contingent was organized on the 25th; now they are rehearsing together every day, preparing to receive Chairman Mao's review on National Day. The students are now busy producing various slogans and charts for the parade; and are busy preparing the photo exhibition to be held by the Student Union on National Day and the Beijing University Summer Donation Achievement Exhibition. School publications such as "Xiaokan", "Shatan", "Youth", "Blackboard News", and "New Literature," which reflect student life, are all preparing to publish special celebration issues.

                (II) Editor Comrade:

    We will tell you about our school's preparations to celebrate National Day. To welcome National Day, our school's administration, various democratic parties, the labor union, and the student union jointly formed a National Day Preparatory Committee. In addition to being busy producing various slogans for the parade, all faculty, students, and staff are actively drilling in formation to receive Chairman Mao's review. To further enhance the students' understanding of the great achievements of the motherland in the two years since its founding, Vice President Ding Haochuan gave a report on "The Current Situation and Celebrating National Day" on the 26th. Students from the Education Department organized a forum with students who returned home during the summer vacation to discuss the new atmosphere in their hometowns; students from the Geography Department held a forum on "Our Great Motherland." The students proposed revising the Patriotic Pledge as a gift to National Day. All the students are determined to implement the resolution of the 15th Student Congress to welcome this great festival.

    Primary School Teachers Should Take Students' Homework Seriously
    — Some Opinions After Visiting the Primary Education Achievement Exhibition in Shexian County, Southern Anhui Editor Comrade:

    The Shexian County People's Government in southern Anhui held a county-wide primary education exhibition during the summer vacation. From the educational achievement exhibits, it can be seen that the comrades of the Shexian County primary education work have indeed begun to attach importance to the theory and methods of the new education, and have achieved certain results in conducting teaching work in a planned, systematic, and purposeful manner. However, judging from the homework results of some students in the exhibition, I feel that there are still many serious shortcomings in our current primary school education work, which must be improved immediately.

        (I) Inappropriate composition topics in the Chinese language class: Some topics are not suitable for children's level and the meaning of the topics themselves is unclear, such as: "How to implement democratic management and the spirit of democracy?". Some topics have unclear meanings and students cannot understand them, such as: "I'll do the same"; some topics have ambiguous stances, and even serious errors, such as: "The disappointment of joining the army";

    (II) Teachers do not correct homework in a practical way: A student's composition titled "Laboring People Draft a Spring Ploughing Production Plan" was deleted by the teacher, leaving only eight characters. Many teachers' comments are empty and do not provide guidance, such as: "The emotions are vivid," "The writing is quite good," "Gentle and detailed," "Clear and fluent," etc.; (III) Too much collective writing: For example, fourth-grade students in Lingkengshang Primary School wrote eight compositions in a semester, three of which were collective writing. I think that too much collective writing will restrict children's independent thinking and creativity; (IV) The explanations of new words in the notes distorted the original meaning: for example, "obey" is explained as "obey and conserve," "convene" is explained as "convene and concentrate," and "supplement" is explained as "the publication behind the newspaper." Using such mechanical or incorrect methods to explain words and sentences is harmful to students.

    Certain Government Agencies in Huguan and Changzhi
    Should Not Hinder Farmers from Finding Employment in Cities Editor Comrade:

    In many areas of the old liberated areas in North China, there is already a surplus of rural labor. This is the result of farmers organizing themselves for production and the exemption of war service. Therefore, at present, many farmers are looking for jobs in cities to solve the problem of surplus labor. Farmers must have a certificate from the district and county government of their origin to find a job in the city. This is necessary. However, some leading agencies in districts and counties deliberately hinder farmers from entering the city, which is wrong. For example, in Hongwei Village, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, three or four farmers found jobs in a factory last year, but the district government refused to issue certificates. Later, they found the higher-level leading agency and the matter was resolved. Han Songlin, a farmer in Potou Village, Changzhi County, wanted to work in a lime factory in Beijing this year. He went to the county government twice, but he still didn't get a certificate of proof. Han Songlin traveled more than two hundred miles back and forth, and achieved nothing. Farmers are the reserve force of industrial production. If factories can accommodate the surplus rural labor force, people's governments at all levels should help farmers find employment, and should not hinder them with any excuses.

    Create More Literary and Artistic Works Reflecting Democratic Governance Editor Comrade:

    Since the founding of China, the people have truly become the masters of the country. The People's Representative Conferences held in various places are unprecedented major events in Chinese history and a great theme that literary and artistic workers should well represent. At present, the county magistrate conference is being held in North China, and a vigorous democratic construction movement is about to unfold. Literary and artistic workers should use literary and artistic forms to vigorously publicize and reflect this movement. However, at present, national and local literary and artistic publications still pay little attention to this matter, and rarely publish works reflecting this political movement. I suggest that literary and artistic workers create more democratic governance works, and literary and artistic publication editors pay more attention to publishing such works.

    Tianjin New China Fire Equipment Factory
    Should Not Imitate and Print Leader's Inscription on Advertisements Editor Comrade:

    Recently, our agency received a promotional advertisement from the Tianjin New China Fire Equipment Manufacturing Factory. The content of the advertisement is to promote general knowledge of fire prevention and introduce various products manufactured by the factory. However, this promotional advertisement actually printed a copy of Chairman Mao's signature and his inscription of "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Chairman Mao cited the idiom "A single spark can start a prairie fire" to illustrate that although the power of the revolution is small in the initial stage, its development prospects are limitless. Chairman Mao's scientific prediction has been fully proven by China's revolutionary practice. The New China Fire Equipment Manufacturing Factory's imitation and printing of Chairman Mao's inscription and signature on the advertisement is completely wrong.

    积极准备迎接国庆日
    （一）编辑同志：
    我们学校全体师生员工，正以无比欢欣的心情，迎接伟大的国庆节。现在，我们将筹备的情况告诉你们。
    九月二十二日，学校行政、各民主党派、工会和学生会联合组成了国庆筹备委员会，迅速订出计划，开始工作。同学们的游行队伍，在二十五日就编好了；现在每天在一起举行操练，准备在国庆节那天，接受毛主席的检阅。同学们现正忙着制作游行用的各种标语、图表；并忙着筹备学生会在国庆节举办的图片展览和北京大学暑假捐献成绩展览。表现同学生活的“校刊”、“沙滩”、“年青人”、“黑板报”、“新文艺”等校内刊物，都准备编辑庆祝专刊。

                （二）编辑同志：
    我们将我们学校筹备庆祝国庆的情况告给你们。为了迎接国庆节我校学校行政、各民主党派、工会和学生会联合组成了国庆节筹备委员会。全校师生员工，除了忙着制作游行用的各种标语外，并积极编队操练，以接受毛主席的检阅。为了使同学们进一步认识祖国成立两年来的伟大成就，二十六日丁浩川副校长作了“目前形势和庆祝国庆”的报告。教育系同学并组织了暑期回家同学，座谈家乡新气象；地理系同学，举行了“我们伟大祖国”的座谈会。同学们提出以修订爱国公约，作为对国庆的献礼。全校同学决心贯彻第十五届学生代表大会的决议，迎接这伟大的节日。

    小学教师应认真对待学生的作业
    ——参观皖南歙县初等教育成绩展览会后的一点意见编辑同志：
    皖南歙县人民政府利用暑假举办了一次全县初等教育展览会。从展览会的教育成绩展览品上，可以看出歙县小学教育工作同志，确已开始重视新教育的理论与方法，在有计划、有系统、有目的地进行教学工作方面，已经获得一定的成绩。但从展览会中一部分学生的作业成绩看来，我觉得目前我们的小学教育工作中还存在着不少严重的缺点，须即设法改进。
        （一）国语科作文命题不恰当：有些题目既不适合儿童程度，本身意思也不通，如：“如何贯彻民主管理、民主精神？”。有些题目意思不明确，学生无法领会，如：“我也来搞一套”；有些题目立场模糊，甚至有严重的错误，如：“参军的失望”；
    （二）教师批改作业不切实：有一篇题为“劳动人民拟定春耕生产计划”的学生作文，被教师删改得只剩下八个字。教师有不少批语内容空洞，起不了指导作用，如：“情意逼真”，“笔意颇好”，“婉转详细”，“通顺清楚”等等；（三）集体写作太多，如岭坑上初小四年级学生，一学期共作文八篇，内有三篇是集体写作的。我认为，过多的集体写作，是会束缚儿童独立思考力和创造力的；（四）笔记中生词解释，歪曲了原意：如“遵守”解释作“遵照保守”，“召集”解释作“召开集中”，“副刊”解释作“报纸后面的刊物”。用这样机械或错误的方法来解释词句，对学生是有害无益的。

    壶关、长治某些政府机关
    不应阻挠农民进城就业编辑同志：
    华北老解放区许多地区，农村劳动力已有剩余。这是农民组织起来进行生产，和战争勤务已经免除的结果。因此，目前有好些农民到城市中寻找职业，以解决剩余劳动力的问题。农民到城市中寻找职业，必须持有原籍区、县政府的证明文件。这是必要的。但是，有些区、县的领导机关，却故意阻挠农民进城，这是错误的。如山西省壶关县洪韦村，去年有三、四个农民已在某工厂找好职业，但区政府不给开证件，后来找到上级领导机关，才把事情解决了。长治县坡头村农民韩松林，今年想到北京某石灰工厂工作，他到县政府去了两次，也没拿到证明信。韩松林往返跑了二百多里地，一无所成。农民是工业生产的后备军，工厂如能容纳农村的剩余劳动力，各级人民政府应该帮助农民就业，而不能以任何藉口加以阻挠。			读者  王良玉
    多创作反映民主建政的文艺作品编辑同志：
    中国建立后，老百姓真正成了国家的主人。各地召开的人民代表会议，是中国历史上从来没有的大事，是文艺工作者应好好表现的伟大主题。目前，华北正在开县长会议，轰轰烈烈的民主建政运动将要展开，文艺工作者应该用文艺形式，大力宣传和反映这一运动。但是，现在全国性和地方性的文艺刊物，还很少注意这件事，还很少发表反映这个政治运动的作品。我建议文艺工作者多创作民主建政的作品，文艺刊物编辑，多注意刊登这类作品。

    天津新中华消火器材厂
    不应在广告上模印领袖题词编辑同志：
    日前我们机关接到天津新中华消火器材制造厂的宣传广告，广告内容是宣传防火的一般常识，并介绍该厂制造的各种产品的。但是，这幅宣传广告上竟印着模仿的毛主席的签名和他的“星星之火，可以燎原”的题字。毛主席引用“星星之火，可以燎原”的成语，是为了说明革命的力量在初期虽然很小，但其发展前途却不可限量。毛主席这一科学的预见，已完全为中国的革命实践证明了。新中华消火器材制造厂竟把毛主席的题词和签名模仿印刷在广告上，这是完全错误的。
