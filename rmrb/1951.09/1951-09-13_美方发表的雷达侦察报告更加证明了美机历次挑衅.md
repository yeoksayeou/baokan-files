Xinhua News Agency, September 12th:

    The main basis for the United Nations Command's admission that the aircraft that strafed the Kaesong neutral zone on September 10th was a US aircraft is their own radar station's reconnaissance report. The United Nations Command's communique stated: "According to a report from the Far East Air Force, radar detected what appeared to be a bizarre event over Kaesong at 1:41 PM on the 10th. Continuous radar tracking and reconnaissance, including directional identification rotations and subsequent transmissions, indicated that the aircraft was a 3D bomber squadron aircraft. According to the pilot's report, he briefly strafed what he believed to be another area at 1:36 PM on September 10th, but according to radar tracking and reconnaissance, this area must have been Kaesong."

    Based on the radar station report mentioned in this communique, one cannot help but recall that the US side also mentioned radar reconnaissance reports when denying the crimes of bombing and strafing our delegation's residence on August 22nd and September 1st. However, the US side did not publish detailed information about the radar reconnaissance on those two occasions, nor did it explain where those two aircraft returned to. The US side twice flatly denied that they were United Nations aircraft, saying that they were of "unidentified nationality," and shamelessly counter-attacked, saying that "Communist aircraft were playing this trick in the sky" and that the bombs were "dropped by Communist aircraft," etc.

    Now, according to the radar reconnaissance station report mentioned in the United Nations Command's communique on September 11th, one cannot help but ask: Given that the US Air Force radar station detected aircraft during the bombing and strafing incidents on August 22nd and September 1st, why didn't it conduct the same tracking reconnaissance and directional identification rotations to find out the aircraft's whereabouts and "nationality"? If the US Air Force radar station had conducted such reconnaissance at that time, why weren't its detailed results published then? Obviously, since the US Air Force radar station can use tracking reconnaissance and directional identification rotation methods to detect that the aircraft that invaded the Kaesong neutral zone on September 10th was a United Nations aircraft, it can also use the same method to detect which country's aircraft invaded the Kaesong neutral zone on August 22nd and September 1st, instead of being of "unidentified nationality." Based on these, one can draw the conclusion that the so-called radar detection of "unidentified nationality" aircraft is nothing more than an excuse to cover up the fact that the aircraft that bombed and strafed our delegation's residence on August 22nd and September 1st were indeed United Nations aircraft. Judging from the fact that US Air Force aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone as many as 170 sorties from August 17th to September 8th, US Air Force aircraft are implementing a planned and systematic policy of provocation. Regardless of whether the US radar station report proves it or not, the people of Kaesong, the bombs and bullets dropped by US aircraft, and the damage they have caused are evidence of the US side's repeated crimes.

### 美方发表的雷达侦察报告更加证明了美机历次挑衅

    美方发表的雷达侦察报告更加证明了美机历次挑衅
    【新华社十二日讯】联合国军司令部承认九月十日扫射开城中立区的飞机是美国飞机的主要根据，是他们自己雷达站的侦察报告。联合国军司令部的公报说：“据远东空军报告，雷达于十日一时四十一分察觉在开城上空发生似乎是怪诞的事情。连续雷达追踪侦察，包括作定向识别旋转及其后的发射，指明飞机是3D轰炸机大队的一架飞机。据驾驶员报告，曾于九月十日一时三十六分在他所相信是另一地区的上空略作扫射，但从雷达的追踪侦察看来，这个地区必定是开城。”
    根据这个公报所提到的雷达站报告，人们不能不想起美方在抵赖八月二十二日与九月一日轰炸、扫射我方代表团住所的罪行时，也曾提到过雷达的侦察报告。然而，美方这两次都没有发表雷达侦察的详细情节，没有说明那两架飞机回到那里去了；美方两次都矢口否认是联合国飞机，说“国籍不明”，并无耻地反噬说是“共方飞机在上空来玩这套把戏”，炸弹是“共方飞机投的”等等。
    现在，根据联合国军司令部九月十一日公报中所提到的雷达侦察站报告，人们不能不发问：对于八月二十二日及九月一日的轰炸与扫射事件，美国空军雷达站既然侦出了飞机，为什么没有进行同样的追踪侦察与定向识别旋转，以便查出飞机的去向和“国籍”呢？如果美国空军雷达站当时已经进行了这样的侦察，它的详细结果当时为什么不发表呢？显然地，美国空军雷达站既然可以用追踪侦察与定向识别旋转等方法，侦出九月十日侵入开城中立区的飞机是联合国军飞机，那么，它也就可以用同样的方法，侦出八月二十二日及九月一日侵入开城中立区的飞机是何国的飞机，而不至于“国籍不明”。根据这些，人们可以得出结论：所谓雷达侦出“国籍不明”飞机云云，无非是掩盖八月二十二日与九月一日轰炸与扫射我方代表团住所的飞机确是联合国军飞机的藉口而已。根据从八月十七日至九月八日止，美国空军飞机侵入开城中立区上空竟多达一百七十架次的事实来看，美国空军飞机是在执行着有计划、有系统的挑衅政策。不管美国的雷达站报告证明也罢，不证明也罢，开城人民，美国飞机投射的炸弹和子弹及其所造成的破坏，就是美方历次罪行的证据。
