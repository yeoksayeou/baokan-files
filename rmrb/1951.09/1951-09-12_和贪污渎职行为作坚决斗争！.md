    Resolutely Fight Against Corruption and Dereliction of Duty!
    Harbin Public Utilities Company Waterworks
    Cadre Corruption and Dereliction of Duty Cause Serious Losses to the State
    The City's Party and Government Leading Organs Have Conducted Stern Handling
    A serious corruption case occurred at the Harbin Public Utilities Company Waterworks. Dong Kui (member of the Harbin Municipal People's Government), head of the Engineering and General Affairs Department of the plant, and other lawless cadres colluded with private merchants in corruption and dereliction of duty, causing serious losses to state property and affecting the completion of the project on schedule. After this matter was discovered, the Harbin Municipal People's Supervisory Committee, together with the Public Utilities Company, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Harbin Municipal People's Procuratorate, organized an investigation team to conduct an inspection. According to the results of the inspection, the engineering losses and waste amounted to more than 7.05 billion yuan (because this corruption case occurred last year, when the currency system was not yet unified, it is calculated in Northeast currency, the same below), embezzlement and bribery of more than 170 million yuan, and unauthorized use of public funds of more than 110 million yuan. The city's Party and government leading organs have now taken stern measures to deal with this.
    1. Facts of corruption and dereliction of duty:
    In June 1950, the private merchant Yushengxiang Iron Factory (managed by Dong Kui's sister's husband) contracted to make iron pipes for the factory, but they did not meet the contract specifications, and 40% of them were unusable. However, because Dong Kui shielded them, it was not discovered. As a result, a section of the water pipeline project was reworked, and the loss of the pipes, the state suffered a total loss of 1.37 billion yuan; the loss of work due to project delays is still incalculable. One batch of pipes was inspected by worker Peng Kuiye. Dong Kui found that he was working conscientiously, so he replaced him through Zhai Xingbing, the deputy section chief of the Engineering Section; finally, he simply stopped the inspection and wrote an acceptance ticket without authorization to receive them. In September 1950, Zhai Xingbing ordered a transformer from the private Haiyang Electric Motor Factory, worth a total of 6.6 billion yuan. The day before the contract was signed, he paid 3.5 billion yuan. The guarantor had only 200 million yuan in funds. Not only did Zhai Xingbing not ask for a replacement guarantor, but he also tried his best to conceal the situation from the private merchant. As a result, the private merchant took a total of 5 billion yuan in order deposits. By the time the contract expired, not a single item had been made, and 2 billion yuan had been spent. Dong Kui knew this at the time, but did not stop it; when the director of the waterworks did not approve the third payment to Haiyang Factory, he defended Zhai Xingbing instead. Dong Kui and Zhai Xingbing worked so hard for the unscrupulous merchants, and the bribes they gave them were numerous. According to what has been discovered, the bribes given to Dong Kui and Zhai Xingbing by the above-mentioned two private merchants included more than 30 million yuan in cash, as well as pens and white flour. In addition, Dong Kui falsely reported losses, travel expenses, etc., embezzling a total of 25 million yuan; and went to Shanghai without approval, wasting about 50 million yuan of public funds, and misappropriating up to 17 million yuan of public funds.
    In order to cover up his corruption and bribery, Dong Kui often gave "small favors" to relevant cadres, and attracted cadres to "deal" with unscrupulous merchants, which affected and promoted the corruption, bribery, and dereliction of duty of other cadres. For example, technician Zhang Xingya took a bag of white flour from Dong Kui (bribed by Yushengxiang) and 20 million yuan from Haiyang Electric Motor Factory, and contracted out the work that could be done by the factory to private merchants. He bought a charging machine with missing parts for 5 million yuan, colluded with mechanic Yu Xilu to replace it with a light bulb and parts, and sold it to the factory for 35 million yuan; the two of them also bought a Ford internal combustion engine for 5.5 million yuan and sold it to the factory in a false name for 20 million yuan. Of the embezzled funds, Zhang Xingya received 28 million yuan, and Yu Xilu received 16.5 million yuan.
    Yang Jingchun, chairman of the trade union, used his position to bribe Zhai Zhongyi, deputy head of the labor insurance section, and then embezzled 8 million yuan of trade union funds. He also lent a total of 7 million yuan of trade union funds to his relatives and friends, and 50 million yuan to a private clinic, but did not lend to employees who were actually in difficulty. Zhai Zhongyi fabricated receipts and embezzled and accepted bribes of about 16 million yuan, and misappropriated 10 million yuan of public funds. Security officer Zhao Wenjing fabricated receipts and embezzled more than 15 million yuan. Guo Fengling attracted private merchants and embezzled and accepted bribes of more than 7.6 million yuan, and misappropriated more than 11 million yuan of public funds.
    2. Reasons for the problem
    First of all, the leading cadres of Harbin Public Utilities Company and the Waterworks neglected the political education of cadres. In recent years, the Public Utilities Company has simply emphasized production and economic accounting, and has not conducted systematic political education for cadres to improve their political quality, resulting in the political degeneration of some cadres. Zhang Peihui, the deputy director of the Waterworks, lost his principles and accommodated illegal cadres. This has allowed corruption and dereliction of duty to gradually develop in the factory, and even become a common and semi-public action. However, the leading cadres of the Public Utilities Company and the Waterworks did not investigate this matter in depth, causing serious losses to the state.
    Secondly, the working system of the Waterworks is extremely unsound. For example, in the financial cash management system, there are eight units in the factory that keep cash, five of which are illegal. All of these cash-keeping units do not have strict systems, and cash in the treasury can be borrowed at will without approval procedures. Another example is the purchase of goods, which is not handled uniformly by the purchasing agent, and anyone can go outside to buy things at will. This has created opportunities for some cadres to embezzle and violate the law. In addition, the factory has not dealt with outstanding payments for a long time. According to the understanding of the investigation team's inspection work at the end of March this year, the factory's outstanding un-reimbursed accounts amounted to as much as 1.4 billion yuan, of which some were more than six months old. This kind of chaos in the system has reached an alarming level!
    3. Handling situation
    Many of the illegal cadres such as Dong Kui are Communist Party members. For the sake of personal enjoyment, they did not hesitate to harm the interests of the people, and gradually degenerated politically, until they completely fell and committed serious violations of law and discipline. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline and educate all Party members, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has separately submitted reports to the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to give disciplinary sanctions to illegal Party members: Dong Kui, Zhai Xingbing, Zhao Wenjing, and Yang Chunjing were expelled from the Party; Zhang Xingya and Zhai Zhongyi were placed on probation within the Party for one year; Guo Fengling, Zhang Peihui, and Guo Lianyu were given a public warning.
    The Harbin Municipal People's Supervisory Committee has also put forward opinions on the handling of illegal cadres, which have been approved by the relevant leading organs: Dong Kui was removed from his position as a member of the Municipal Government and Director of the General Affairs Department of the Waterworks, and transferred to the People's Procuratorate to be prosecuted by the court, and submitted to the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council for approval and filing. Zhai Xingbing, Zhang Xingya, Zhai Zhongyi, Zhao Wenjing, Yu Xilu, and Guo Fengling were removed from their administrative positions. It is recommended that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions dismiss Yang Chunjing. The above seven people will also be prosecuted by the People's Procuratorate to the court. Zhang Peihui was given a major demerit. The other sixteen people who embezzled and misappropriated less public funds have been instructed to be handled by the Public Utilities Company. In addition, the Harbin Municipal People's Supervisory Committee also instructed the Municipal Construction Bureau and the Public Utilities Company to improve the administrative leadership of the Waterworks, improve its financial system, be responsible for recovering the funds defrauded by private merchants and embezzled funds, and, on the basis of this inspection, mobilize the masses of the Waterworks to continue to conduct in-depth inspections.
    The private merchants Yushengxiang Iron Factory and Haiyang Electric Motor Factory violated the law by offering bribes and deceiving the public. The government has arrested their responsible persons and the court will handle the matter.

    Shanxi Provincial Department of Transportation
    Serious Embezzlement Case Occurs
    Local Government Should Immediately Take Stern Action
    A serious embezzlement case occurred in the Shanxi Provincial Department of Transportation. Zhao Yiru, deputy section chief of the Storage Section, Wang Zhaoxiang, chief of the Materials Section, and other illegal cadres colluded with private merchants, accepted bribes, and stole state materials. According to incomplete statistics, the loss of state property is worth about one million catties of millet.
    In 1949, when the Shanxi Provincial Department of Transportation took over the transportation equipment of the Yan bandit, a large number of new and old automobile tires and various parts were found in the Donghuayuan warehouse. After this equipment was sealed by the Taiyuan Municipal Military Control Commission, Zhao Yiru, the deputy section chief of the Business Section of the bureau at that time (later transferred to deputy section chief of the Storage Section), was responsible for its custody. During the first warehouse inspection, it was found that the warehouse was short of 15 new tires and 135 inner tubes, with an estimated value of about 450,000 catties of millet. However, the leadership at the time did not pursue the matter, which made the lawless elements even bolder and committed serious acts of embezzlement.
    Many illegal cadres in the bureau colluded with private merchants, embezzled and accepted bribes, and then used state property to give favors. For example, Zhao Yiru, Wang Zhaoxiang, and warehouse keepers Qu Dunhui, Na Weiwen, and Bai Lanxuan often accepted banquets and material bribes from He Bingwu, the manager of the private Xiyuan Industrial Institute, and sold the company's equipment to Xiyuan Industrial Institute at low prices. For example, in October 1949, 169 automobile tires and 152 inner tubes were sold to He Bingwu at low prices, causing the state to lose more than 6.32 million yuan. When selling automobile iron beams and other equipment, the state lost more than 12,000 catties of millet. In addition, every time the Department of Transportation sold goods, it was necessary to notify the Xiyuan Industrial Institute in advance and give it various conveniences. Zhao Yiru and others also colluded with Song Jian, the secretary of the Business Section, and successively sold automobile frames, tires, and various parts and other materials to private merchants at low prices. According to incomplete statistics, the state lost more than 136,000 catties of millet. They also illegally gave more than 5,000 catties of glycerol, a prohibited product, to the private merchant Liang Shanting on credit at a low price, causing the state to lose more than 160,000 catties of millet. Song Jian also made false reports to the higher authorities, saying that the alcohol stored in the bureau with a degree of more than 70 degrees was only 40 degrees, and sold the alcohol as waste products to make profits. In November 1949, when the bureau sold waste lead, it actually destroyed many useful materials such as electrical boxes, batteries, and electrical rollers and sold them as waste lead, causing the state to lose 120,000 catties of millet.
    The bureau's illegal cadres Zhao Yiru, Wang Zhaoxiang, Na Weiwen, Hao Pei, etc., stole a large number of materials in an organized and planned manner. Among them, Wang Zhaoxiang took the lead in partnering with private merchants to open a "Two-Profit Factory" with the stolen equipment. Wang Zhaoxiang also bought two automobile frames from the bureau, and after repairing and assembling them with the stolen parts, he exchanged them for two good automobiles for transportation and sales. The stolen parts, excluding those already invested in the "Two-Profit Factory", totaled 758 pieces, which are worth more than 100,000 catties of millet at a 60% valuation. Na Weiwen once used a car to carry out two boxes of equipment, and he also carried out a box himself. For just one item, beads, he stole 20 plates at once. Hao Pei also stole a large number of tools and was preparing to open a bicycle shop with them. This embezzlement incident not only caused serious losses to state property, but also had a very bad impact on the masses. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government should thoroughly investigate and deal with it severely.

    和贪污渎职行为作坚决斗争！
    哈尔滨市公用事业公司自来水厂
    干部贪污渎职造成国家严重损失
    该市党政领导机关已进行严正处理
    哈尔滨市公用事业公司自来水厂发生严重贪污案。该厂工程总务部长董魁（哈尔滨市人民政府委员）等不法干部，勾结私商，贪污渎职，使国家财产受到严重损失，并影响工程未能按期完成。此事经发觉后，哈尔滨市人民监察委员会即与公用事业公司、中共哈尔滨市委纪律检查委员会、哈尔滨市人民检察署组织调查小组进行检查。根据检查结果，工程损失浪费达七十亿五千余万元（因为这个贪污案件发生在去年，当时币制还没有统一，所以是按东北币计，下同），贪污受贿一亿七千余万元，擅自动用公款一亿一千余万元。现该市党政领导机关对此已进行严正处理。
    一、贪污渎职事实：
    一九五○年六月，私商裕盛祥铁工厂（经理为董魁的姐夫）包作该厂铁管子，不按合同规格，有百分之四十不能使用。但因董魁包庇，未得发现。结果使一部水道工程返工，加上管子的损失，国家共损失十三亿七千万元；工程误工损失还无法计算。有一批管子曾由工友彭奎业检查，董魁发现他工作认真，就通过工务科副科长翟星炳把他换掉；最后干脆不再检查，擅写验收票收了。一九五○年九月，翟星炳向私商海洋电机工厂定制变压器，总值六十六亿元。合同签订前一天，他就付款三十五亿。合同保证人仅有二亿资金，翟星炳不但不要求换保，反而极力为私商隐瞒。结果该私商共拿了定货款五十亿。到合同期满，定货一件也未作，把钱花掉了二十亿。董魁当时明知其情，也不加阻挡；在海洋厂第三次支款，自来水厂厂长不批时，他反为翟星炳辩护。董魁、翟星炳这样替奸商出力，私商给他们的贿赂很多。据已发现者，上述两家私商给董魁、翟星炳的贿赂有现款三千余万及钢笔、白面等。此外，董魁曾虚报损失、路费等，共贪污二千五百万元；并且未经批准擅去上海，浪费公款约五千万元，动用公款达一千七百余万元。
    董魁为掩盖自己贪污受贿行为，经常给有关干部“小恩小惠”，拉拢干部与奸商“打交道”，影响和助长了其他干部的贪污受贿渎职行为。如技术员张兴亚，拿了董魁白面（裕盛祥所贿）一袋、海洋电机工厂二千万元，就把本厂能做的活也包给私商。他以五百万元买入一台缺少零件的充电机，勾通机工于锡禄换上一个灯泡与零件，作价三千五百万元卖给厂内；他们两人又以五百五十万元买了一座佛特内燃机，用假名以二千万元卖给厂方。贪污的款项，张兴亚分得二千八百万元，于锡禄分得一千六百五十万元。
    工会主席杨景春利用职权，贿赂劳保股副股长翟仲羿后，贪污工会公款八百万。他还把工会公款借给他的亲戚朋友共七百万元，借给某私营诊疗所五千万元，而对实有困难的职工，却不借给。翟仲羿则假造单据，贪污受贿约一千六百万元，动用公款一千万元。保卫干事赵文经，假造单据，贪污一千五百余万元。郭凤岭，拉拢私商，贪污受贿七百六十余万元，动用公款一千一百余万元。
    二、发生问题的原因
    首先，哈尔滨市公用事业公司及自来水厂领导干部忽视了对干部的政治教育工作。公用事业公司近年来单纯强调了生产及经济核算，没有对干部进行系统的政治教育，提高干部的政治质量，致使某些干部政治上蜕化。自来水厂副厂长张培惠则更失掉原则，迁就违法的干部。这样就使贪污渎职行为在该厂逐渐发展，甚至成为普遍而半公开的行动。但公用事业公司和自来水厂领导干部对此亦不深入查究，使国家受到严重的损失。
    其次，自来水厂工作制度极不健全。如财务现金管理制度上，该厂仅行政方面，就有八个单位保管现金，其中有五个单位是非法的。所有这些保管现金的单位都没有严格的制度，库内现金可以不经批准手续随便借支。又如采购物品，不是由采买员统一办理，任何人都可到外面随意采买东西。这都造成一些干部贪污违法的机会。此外，该厂对挂支款项长期不处理。据今年三月末调查小组检查工作所了解，该厂挂支未报销账目竟达十四亿之多，其中有超过六个月者。这种制度上的混乱现象，已到了惊人的程度！
    三、处理情况
    董魁等违法干部，很多是共产党员。他们为了个人享受，竟不惜损害人民利益，在政治上逐渐蜕化，终至完全堕落，做出严重违法乱纪的事来。为了严肃党纪，教育全体党员，中共哈尔滨市委员会纪律检查委员会已分别呈准东北局纪律检查委员会及中共松江省委纪律检查委员会，给违法党员以纪律处分：董魁、翟星炳、赵文经、杨春景，开除党籍；张兴亚、翟仲羿，留党察看一年；郭凤岭、张培惠、郭连玉当众警告。
    哈尔滨市人民监察委员会对违法干部亦已分别提出处理意见，并经各有关领导机关批准：董魁，撤消市政府委员及自来水厂行政总务部长职务，转送人民检察署向法院起诉法办，并呈中央人民政府政务院核准备案。翟星炳、张兴亚、翟仲羿、赵文经、于锡禄、郭凤岭撤消行政职务，杨春景，建议市总工会予以撤职；上述七人并将由人民检察署向法院起诉法办。张培惠记大过一次。其他贪污及动用公款较少的十六人则已责成公用事业公司负责处理。此外，哈尔滨市人民监察委员会并责成该市建设局及公用事业公司改善自来水厂行政领导，健全其财务制度，负责追回私商骗取的款项及贪污款项等，并在这次检查的基础上，发动自来水厂群众继续进行深入检查。
    私商裕盛祥铁工厂、海洋电机厂违法行贿，欺骗公家，政府已将其负责人逮捕，由法院处理。

    山西省交通局
    发生严重贪污案
    当地政府应即进行严正处理
    山西省交通局发生严重贪污案。该局保管科副科长赵以儒、材料股长王兆祥等部分不法干部，勾结私商，接受贿赂，盗窃国家物资。据不完全统计，国家财产损失约值小米百万斤。
    一九四九年，山西省交通局接管阎匪交通器材时，发现东花园库内存有大批新旧汽车内外胎及各种零件。此项器材经太原市军事管制委员会查封后，由该局当时的业务科副科长赵以儒（后调任为保管科副科长）负责保管。当第一次查库时，发现库中短少新外胎十五条，内胎一百三十五条，估价共约小米四十五万斤。但当时领导方面对此事没有进行追究，致使不法分子更加大胆妄为，做出严重的贪污行为。
    该局不少不法干部勾结私商，贪污受贿后，就以国家财产来送人情。如赵以儒、王兆祥及管库员曲敦惠、那维文、白兰轩等，经常接受私商西原工业所经理和丙午的宴请及财物贿赂，将公司器材低价卖给西原工业所。如一九四九年十月低价卖给和丙午汽车外胎一百六十九条，内胎一百五十二条，使国家损失六百三十二万余元。在出卖汽车铁梁等器材时，使国家损失小米一万二千余斤。此外，每逢交通局卖货时，事先必通知西原工业所，并给该所以种种便利。赵以儒等又和业务处秘书宋剑勾通，先后贱价卖给私商汽车架、内外胎及各种零件等材料。据不完全统计，使国家损失小米十三万六千余斤。他们又违法将禁售品甘油五千余斤贱价赊给私商梁善亭，使国家损失小米十六万余斤。宋剑并曾向上级打假报告，把该局所存七十度以上的酒精说成仅四十度，把酒精当废品出卖，从中取利。一九四九年十一月该局出卖废铅时，竟把电盒、电瓶、电滚等许多有用材料破坏当废铅出卖，使国家损失小米十二万斤。
    该局不法干部赵以儒、王兆祥、那维文、郝培等，有组织、有计划地偷窃大批资材。其中以王兆祥为首，把偷出的器材和私商合伙，开设了一个“两利工厂”。王兆祥并买了该局汽车架两辆，用偷出的零件修配后，换了两辆好汽车进行运输买卖。他们偷出的零件，除已投入“两利工厂”者不算，共计七百五十八件，按六成估价，即值小米十万余斤。那维文有一次竟用汽车捎出器材两箱，自己还搬出一箱，仅珠子一项，一次即偷出二十盘。郝培也偷出了大批工具，还准备用此开设一家自行车行。这一贪污事件，不仅使国家资财受到严重的损失，并且在群众中造成极不良的影响，山西省人民政府应澈底查究，严正处理。
