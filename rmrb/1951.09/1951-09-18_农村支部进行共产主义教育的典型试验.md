    Typical Experiment of Rural Branch Conducting Communist Education
    Propaganda Department of the CCP Pingyuan Provincial Committee
    In order to fundamentally solve the peasant ideology of rural party members, in mid-May we selected village branches in four different regions: Weicun in Neihuang (an old revolutionary base area), Wangqucun in Qinyang (a semi-old revolutionary base area), Shuangmiaowang in Caoxian (a restored area), and Dongxishitao in Yexian (a new area), to conduct typical experiments in communist education.
    The party members and masses in these four branches have high enthusiasm for production, but their living standards are still not wealthy enough. According to the statistics of 43 party members from the Weizhuang, Wangqucun, and Dongxishitao branches: 17 party members are of poor peasant origin, and their biggest worry is fear of starvation; 23 party members are of middle peasant origin, and they only fear natural disasters and man-made calamities, and demand to have enough to eat and spare; 3 party members are of wealthy middle peasant origin, and they have begun to consider how to deal with their surplus grain: buying land and hiring laborers to become new rich peasants, or participating in cooperatives and mutual aid groups to develop production together with the masses? Or maintain the status quo?
    The four branches have a total of 59 party members, of whom only a few know the basic principles of socialism, which is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and communism, which is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," or are completely unaware of these basic principles. The majority only know that the Communist Party will implement communism in the future, but they do not know what communism is or how to implement it, which has led to many confused ideas: First, some believe that "land reform is socialism" and that "the revolution has succeeded." To do more is to "lose money." Eighteen of the twenty-one party members in Wangqucun believe that victory in the Korean War means "the revolution has succeeded." Second, they regard utopian agricultural socialism as communism, such as party member An Yangli from Wangqucun who said: "Communism is everything in public, collective work, men and women separated, eating together." Another example is party member Shi Hequan from Dongxishitao who said: "Implementing communism is a village-wide mutual aid, doing whatever one is good at, with the same food and clothing." Party member Chen Yongshun said: "In communism, ten families share one pot, grain is distributed, and party members are in charge." Third, there are concerns about socialism and communism. Some fear that "land and property will be collectivized, and one won't be in charge." Some fear that "eating and working will be timed... how unfree." Some fear that they have few skills and won't be able to make a living, "not knowing foreign languages and not knowing how to operate machines, receiving little in return, and having to go hungry." and so on.
    Based on the above situation, according to the basic principles of the Party Constitution and in combination with the production and living conditions of the people in the Soviet socialist country, we focused on the following issues for education:
    First, clarify the ultimate goal of the revolution, establish a revolutionary view of fighting to the end for the cause of communism, and further criticize the "revolution succeeded" ideology.
    Second, explain the socialist and communist systems, instill scientific socialism and communism, and specifically criticize the utopian agricultural socialist ideas of "everything in public, grain distributed." Enable party members to understand that only with an unparalleled increase in productivity can we reach socialist and communist societies, which are the happiest and most fulfilling societies for mankind.
    Third, explain that China must go through New Democracy to realize socialism and communism. Enable party members to understand the direction of New Democratic construction - national industrialization and agricultural collectivization; understand that organizing mutual aid and cooperation is the only correct path to develop the rural economy. Inspire party members to actively lead the masses to participate in the construction of a New Democratic country, and criticize the idea of only caring about personal production and not caring about the interests of the masses and the country.
    Rural party members often view problems from the perspective of themselves, their families, and their immediate surroundings, and advocate "seeing is believing, hearing is deceiving" when it comes to the future of social and historical development. Therefore, it is not easy for them to accept education if it starts from communism. If it only starts from current problems, it is easy to lose direction. In response to this situation, our educational content pays attention to the combination of far and near, and uses methods such as seminars, lectures, recollections and comparisons, and exhibition visits to enlighten thinking and clarify direction. First, ask what is the ultimate goal of the revolution, and then, from the personal experience of the current three major movements, combined with visiting exhibitions, inspire them to recall the past, compare the present, and imagine the future. Many party members in these four branches have seen large machines and new agricultural tools, which creates conditions for them to pursue the long-term vision from New Democratic construction to socialism and communism.
    After preliminary education, most party members have begun to understand some of the principles of socialism and communism, and have further criticized the ideas of "the revolution has succeeded" and utopian agricultural socialism. This has inspired courage to move forward and promoted realistic struggles and current work. For example, some party members said: "In the past, when the masses asked whether socialism meant eating from a big pot, we couldn't answer, but now we have something to say!" Some said: "If we just lie down and do nothing, a good society will not come in a hundred years." Most party members expressed their determination to fight to the end for the cause of communism and said: "How can we cross the river without a bridge? We can't reach socialism without building a good New Democratic society." Some reflected and said: "In the past, leading mutual aid groups was troublesome, but we must do a good job in the future!" Finally, everyone said, "We must lead the masses to produce more, aid Korea, and eliminate American imperialism!"
    In the process of conducting trial education, we still have some shortcomings: some comrades do not have enough understanding of the party members' ideological situation and changes in thinking, so they talk too much and too vaguely, and cannot solve problems in connection with specific thoughts; some comrades talk about communism too specifically, and party members raise many questions that are difficult to answer. Some focus on seminars and do not systematically focus on solving the fundamental viewpoints of party members. Therefore, some party members have expressed their attitudes along with the majority, but basically still understand socialism and communism from the perspective of peasant small producers, such as saying, "I am too old, and even if communism is good, I will not live long enough to see it, and any benefits from working harder will go to others." Some said: "Our village is so poor, we will never reach socialism in our lifetime." Some also said: "Whether communism is that good, we cannot disbelieve it, but we cannot completely believe it." These situations show that solving the peasant ideology among party members is a long-term and arduous task.
    Undeniably, we have achieved some results in the trial education. These results prove that to fundamentally solve the peasant ideology of rural party members, we must start with communist education. Such education is also a universal and urgent demand of party members.

### 农村支部进行共产主义教育的典型试验

    农村支部进行共产主义教育的典型试验
    中共平原省委宣传部
    为了从根本上解决农村党员的农民思想，我们于五月中旬选择了老区的内黄魏村，半老区的沁阳王曲村，恢复区的曹县双庙王，新区的邺县东西石桃等四种不同地区的村支部，进行了共产主义教育的典型试验。
    这四个支部的党员群众的生产情绪很高，但生活水平还是不够富裕。据魏庄、王曲村、东西石桃三个支部的四十三个党员的统计：贫农成份的党员有十七人，他们最大的顾虑是怕挨饿；中农成份的党员二十三人，他们只怕天灾人祸，要求有吃有余；富裕中农党员三人，他们开始考虑对自己余粮的处理问题，是买地雇工当新富农，或是参加合作社，参加互助组与群众共同发展生产？还是维持现状？
    四个支部共有党员五十九人，其中知道社会主义是“各尽所能、各取所值”，共产主义是“各尽所能、各取所需”的基本道理，或对这一基本道理毫无所知的都是少数。多数只是知道共产党将来要实行共产主义，但不知什么是共产主义，也不知道如何实行共产主义，因而产生许多糊涂思想：第一、有的认为“土地改革就是社会主义”，就是“革命成功”了。再干就“赔本”了。王曲村二十一个党员中有十八人认为朝鲜战争胜利就是“革命成功”。第二、把空想农业社会主义当作共产主义，如王曲村党员安羊力说：“共产主义是一切充公，集体干活，男女分开，一块吃饭。”又如东西石桃党员石和泉说：“实行共产主义是全村大互助，会啥干啥，吃穿
    一样。”党员陈永顺说：“到共产主义十家一口锅，粮食领着吃，党员当家。”第三、对社会主义和共产主义有顾虑，有的怕“土地财产归公，不当家。”有的怕“吃饭干活都按钟点，……多不自由”，有的怕本事少，吃不开，“不认识洋码，不会开机器，取值少，要挨饿。”等等。
    根据以上情况，我们按照党章基本原则，结合苏联社会主义国家人民生产与生活情况，着重抓住以下几个问题进行教育：
    第一、明确革命的最后目的，树立为共产主义事业奋斗到底的革命观点，进一步批判“革命成功”思想。
    第二、说明社会主义与共产主义制度，灌输科学的社会主义与共产主义，具体批判“一切充公，粮食领着吃”的空想的农业社会主义思想。使党员了解只有生产力无比增加，才能到达社会主义、共产主义社会，那是人类最幸福，最美满的社会。
    第三、说明中国实现社会主义、共产主义，必须经过新民主主义。使党员了解新民主主义建设方向——国家工业化、农业集体化；了解组织起来互助合作是发展农村经济唯一正确的道路。启发党员积极带领群众参加新民主主义国家建设，批判只顾个人生产不关心群众与国家利益的思想。
    农村党员看问题的方法多从本人本家、当时当地出发，对社会历史发展前途，则主张“眼见为实，耳听是虚”，因此，对于他们的教育，如果只从共产主义说起则不易接受，如只从眼前问题说起又极易迷失方向。针对这一情况，我们的教育内容，注意由远到近与由近到远的结合，并经过座谈讲授、回忆对比、展览参观等方法，达到启发思想，明确方向。首先提出革命的最后目的是什么，然后从当前的三大运动的亲身体验，结合参观展览，启发他们回忆过去，对比现在，推想将来。这四个支部中有不少党员见过大机器和新式农具，这就有条件使他们追求由新民主主义建设，到社会主义、共产主义的远景。
    经过了初步教育，多数党员都开始懂得一些社会主义和共产主义的道理，进一步批判了“革命成功”与空想农业社会主义思想。鼓舞了前进勇气，推动了现实斗争与当前工作。如有的党员说：“以前群众问社会主义是否吃大锅饭，咱答不上来，以后可有说的啦！”有的说：“光躺倒不干，好社会一百年也不到来。”大部分党员表示了坚决为共产主义事业奋斗到底的态度。并说：“没桥怎能过河，不把新民主主义社会建设好，就到不了社会主义。”有的检讨说：“过去领导互助组嫌麻烦，以后可得好好干哩！”最后大家表示“要领导群众多生产，援助朝鲜，消灭美帝国主义！”
    在试行教育的过程中，我们还有些缺点：表现在有的同志对党员的思想情况和思想变化了解不够，因而讲得太多太空，不能结合具体思想解决问题，有的同志把共产主义讲得太具体，而党员提出许多疑问，不好解答。有的偏重座谈，没有系统地着重解决党员的根本观点。因而有些党员曾经随着多数人表示了自己的态度，但基本上还是以农民小生产者的观点去了解社会主义和共产主义，如说“自己年纪老了，共产主义再好也熬不到了，再干好处是人家的了。”有的说：“咱村这样穷，一辈子也到不了社会主义。”还有人说：“共产主义是否那样好，不可不信，不可全信。”这些情况说明了解决党员中的农民思想是个长期的艰巨的工作。
    不可否认，我们在试行教育中收到了一些效果，这些效果证明了要根本上解决农村党员的农民思想，必须从共产主义教育着手。这样的教育，也是党员普遍、迫切的要求。
