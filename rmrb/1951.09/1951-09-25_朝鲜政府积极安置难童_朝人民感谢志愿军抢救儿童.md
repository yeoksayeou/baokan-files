Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 21st. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is working to resettle Korean children who have been devastated by the American war of aggression. Recently, a group of refugee children were taken to northern Korea to be sent to the "Nursery Homes" run by the Korean government. This group of orphans, who have no parents or homes, totals sixty-nine, the oldest being no more than fifteen years old, and the youngest only four years old. Most of them are from the area near the 38th parallel, and some are refugees who fled from south of the 38th parallel.

When this group of orphans passed through a village north of Pyonggang, the soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed in the village warmly received them, giving them biscuits and 390 jin of rice.

Old Mr. Han Shengde, who led the group of orphans, repeatedly expressed his gratitude for the help the Chinese People's Volunteers had given them along the way. He said gratefully, "Many of these children were saved by the Volunteer comrades. The Volunteer comrades rescued them from enemy strafing and heavy artillery fire."

    朝人民感谢志愿军抢救儿童
   【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府正在设法安置深受美国侵略战争摧残的朝鲜儿童。最近有一批受难儿童被带往朝鲜北部，准备送入朝鲜政府所办的“爱育院”。这群无父无母、无家可归的孤儿一共六十九人，其中最大的不过十五岁，最小的只有四岁，大部分是三八线附近地区的人，有的是从三八线以南逃难过来的。
   这群孤儿经过平康以北某村时，住在这村的志愿军某部战士们十分亲热接待他们，送给了他们饼干和三百九十斤大米。
   带领这群孤儿的韩圣德老先生连声感谢一路上志愿军给他们的帮助。他感激地说：“这些孩子很多是志愿军同志把他们救活的。志愿军同志从敌机扫射与猛烈的炮火下抢救出了他们。”
