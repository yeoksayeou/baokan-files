    The Bloody Crimes of the American Invading Army
    The People of Pyongyang Suffering from Floods Were Madly Strafeed and Slaughtered by American Planes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th] According to the "Pravda" correspondent in Pyongyang, Dekachenko, another bloody crime of the American invading army in massacring Korean peaceful residents stated: On August 27th and 28th, after a rainstorm unseen in decades, the Daedong River suddenly overflowed, flooding the eastern, western, and southern parts of Pyongyang, neighboring villages, and workers' residences. In some places, the water was ten meters deep. People took refuge on treetops, ruined buildings, and the roofs of flooded village houses. Residents of the suburbs all went to the mountains.
    On the morning of August 29th, the weather was clear, and more than forty American attack planes and fighter planes flew low over Pyongyang and its nearby villages. At that time, it was easy to see things, and the pilots must have seen that the water had flooded Pyongyang and the neighboring villages. They saw the people on the roofs, in the trees, and in the mountains, and cruelly strafed them with machine guns and frantically dropped many fragmentation bombs to bomb them. An hour or an hour and a half later, another thirty-two American planes flew over the area and subjected these defenseless people to another brutal bombing. People hit by bullets and bomb fragments fell down. The river water was stained red with people's blood. Dekachenko pointed out: This crime of the American invaders was intentionally arranged after the residents of Pyongyang and its vicinity suffered from the flood, so it was even more cruel. The Korean people's indignation and hatred for the brutal and vicious invaders are difficult to express in words.

    美国侵略军的血腥罪行
    平壤遭受水灾的人民竟被美机疯狂扫射屠杀
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：“真理报”驻平壤记者德卡诚科报道美国侵略军屠杀朝鲜和平居民的又一血腥罪行称：八月二十七、二十八日，在下过了数十年以来未曾有过的一次暴雨以后，大同江突然泛滥了，淹没了平壤的东部、西部、南部、邻近的村庄以及工人的住所。有些地方，水深十公尺。人们到树顶上、毁坏了的建筑物和水淹了的村屋的屋顶上去避难。四郊的居民都到山上去了。
    八月二十九日早晨，天气晴朗，四十多架美国攻击机和战斗机在平壤及其附近的村庄的上空低飞着。那时看东西是很容易的，驾驶员一定看见水淹没了平壤和邻近的村落，他们看见屋顶上、树上和山上的人们，就残酷地用机关枪扫射他们，并疯狂地投掷许多杀伤弹来炸他们。一个钟头或一个半钟头以后，又有三十二架美国飞机飞临上空，对这些毫无防御的人民再度施以残酷的轰炸。被枪弹和炸弹碎片击中的人们倒下了。江水被人们的鲜血染红了。德卡诚科指出：美国侵略者这一罪行是在平壤及其附近的居民遭遇水灾之后有意安排的，因此它也就更为残酷。朝鲜人民对于凶狠毒辣的侵略者的愤慨和仇恨是难于用言语来表达的。
