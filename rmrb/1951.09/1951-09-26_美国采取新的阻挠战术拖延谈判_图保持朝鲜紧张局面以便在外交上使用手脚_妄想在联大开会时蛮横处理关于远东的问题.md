    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 25th: This reporter has learned from relevant sources that the United Nations Command is using new obstructive tactics regarding the resumption of armistice negotiations, making it impossible to resume negotiations immediately. The situation is as follows:

    Since General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai sent two letters to Ridgway on September 19th and 24th, proposing the immediate resumption of armistice talks in Kaesong, our liaison officer immediately contacted the opposing liaison officer on September 24th and 25th, based on the letters from Generals Kim and Peng on September 24th, to reach an agreement on the date and time of the resumption, so that the armistice negotiations could continue. However, the other party insisted on refusing to discuss the date and time of the resumption of negotiations, and instead wanted to first discuss the conditions for resumption. In a memorandum prepared in advance by the opposing liaison officer, Colonel Kinney, the idea of changing the Kaesong meeting site was even brought up again as part of these conditions. The armistice negotiations were originally interrupted because the United Nations Command violated the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement, making it impossible for the meeting to proceed. If, as a result, a request is made to change the Kaesong meeting site, wouldn't this precisely prove that the United Nations Command's series of provocative acts to destroy the Kaesong Neutral Zone were intended to achieve this goal? How can all fair-minded people in the world allow such a cunning and vile conspiracy to succeed? In fact, the United Nations Command has had to admit to their last serious act of sabotage and expressed regret. Because they admitted to the act of destroying the neutral zone and expressed their willingness to deal with it in a responsible manner, our side suggested resuming the armistice negotiations. Now, what reason do they have to ask our side for conditions for resumption instead of immediately resuming the armistice talks? Speaking of obtaining guarantees satisfactory to both sides to ensure the smooth progress of the armistice negotiations, General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai have made it very clear in their letters to Ridgway on September 19th and 24th that at the first meeting after the resumption of armistice negotiations, both sides should agree to establish an appropriate mechanism to formulate a strict agreement on the neutralization of the Kaesong area and to deal with many unresolved incidents in the past when the United Nations Command violated the neutral zone. In this way, on the one hand, the armistice negotiations can no longer be delayed, and on the other hand, a strict agreement can be reached at the same time to ensure that the armistice negotiations are not obstructed. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on September 24th, even a spokesman for Ridgway's headquarters believed that "it is reasonable for the principal representatives themselves to make arrangements to deal with the issue of infringing on the armistice zone." Why is the United Nations Command unwilling to do so, and insisting on discussing conditions first to delay time? Obviously, the major and detailed work of establishing a strict agreement on the neutralization of the Kaesong area, so as to ensure the smooth progress of the armistice negotiations and prevent them from being obstructed or interrupted again, must be handled by an appointed body designated by both sides, rather than being able to be undertaken by one or two liaison officers. Why does the United Nations Command not entrust such an issue concerning the Korean armistice and the lives and safety of millions of people to the solemn handling of representatives from both sides, but instead push it to liaison officers to obstruct the resumption of the armistice conference?

    From this, people cannot but draw the conclusion that: after sabotaging the armistice negotiations in the past month, the United Nations Command is now continuing to adopt new obstructive tactics, delaying negotiations in order to achieve its ulterior motives. In the past month, the US government instructed the United Nations Command to adopt tactics to disrupt the armistice negotiations in order to maintain the tense situation in Korea, so that the United States could coerce its puppet states into signing the Japanese peace treaty unilaterally concocted by the United States at the San Francisco Conference. Now it is adopting new obstructive tactics to maintain the tense situation in Korea, so as to facilitate its high-handed handling of a series of issues concerning the Far East at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in early November. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on September 22nd, so-called well-informed sources in Washington are worried that "a prominent feature of this UN General Assembly will be a new effort by the Communist bloc to win Communist China's entry into the UN"; and because "it is hopeless for Asian countries to unite with the United States to obstruct this effort" they are worried about the "victory" of the "Communist bloc". Therefore, they are determined to obstruct and delay the Korean armistice negotiations. After worrying about the above issues, the so-called well-informed sources also wishfully hope that the China issue will not be brought up at the UN General Assembly, because they believe that "in fact, it is completely impossible to be certain that the Korean War can be stopped in early November," and because they hope that "if the Conservative Party wins the general election on October 25th, Britain's attitude towards Communist China may change." Because of all this, according to the column written by the American columnist Childs and published in the Washington Post on September 19th, the US State Department has even discovered a strange view on the armistice: they "believe that a state of war has actually come to a standstill, even if it has not been formally approved by both parties, it is equal to an armistice." In other words, the US State Department does not want an armistice agreement to ease the tense situation in Korea, but wants to prolong the current state, so as to facilitate their diplomatic maneuvers.

    However, this new delaying tactic of obstruction of negotiations by US imperialism will not work. The pressure from the people, including the American army, to demand an armistice and the resumption of armistice negotiations, coupled with the difficulties and contradictions within American imperialism, will cause their new conspiracy to run into a wall.

### 美国采取新的阻挠战术拖延谈判  图保持朝鲜紧张局面以便在外交上使用手脚  妄想在联大开会时蛮横处理关于远东的问题

    美国采取新的阻挠战术拖延谈判
    图保持朝鲜紧张局面以便在外交上使用手脚
    妄想在联大开会时蛮横处理关于远东的问题
   【新华社开城二十五日电】记者从有关方面获悉，联合国军方面在关于恢复停战谈判问题上又在使用新的阻挠战术，使谈判无法立即恢复。其情形如下：
    自金日成将军彭德怀将军于九月十九日、二十四日两次致函李奇微，提出立即在开城恢复停战会议的主张以后，我方联络官当即根据金、彭两将军二十四日去文于九月二十四日及二十五日两度与对方联络官接触，准备就复会的日期和时间取得协议，以便停战谈判得以继续进行。但是对方却坚持不肯讨论恢复谈判的日期和时间问题，而要首先讨论复会的条件。在对方联络官肯尼上校事先准备好的备忘录中，甚至再度提出变更开城会议地址作为这种条件的内容。停战谈判本来是由于联合国军方面破坏了开城区中立化协议使会议无法进行而致中断的，如果因此而要求变更开城会议地址，这岂不刚好证明联合国军破坏开城中立区的一连串的挑衅行为，就是为了要实现这个企图么？世界上一切公正人民，怎能容许这样狡诈恶劣的阴谋得逞呢？事实上联合国军方面已经不得不承认他们的最后一次严重的破坏行动而表示了遗憾。因为他们承认了破坏中立区的行动并表示要对这种行动以负责态度来处理，我方即建议恢复停战谈判。现在他们有什么理由反来向我方要求复会的条件而不肯立即恢复停战会议呢？讲到取得双方满意的使停战谈判得以顺利进行的保障，金日成将军与彭德怀将军在九月十九日及二十四日致李奇微的两信中均已说得很明白，在停战谈判恢复后的第一次会议上就要由双方协议成立适当的机构来制定开城区中立化的严格的协议，并处理过去联合国军侵犯中立区的许多未了事件。这样，一方面停战谈判可以不再拖延下去，另一方面同时又可以取得使停战谈判不受阻挠的严格的协议。这种办法据美联社东京二十四日电，甚至连李奇微总部发言人都认为“由主要代表们自己进行布置以处理侵犯休战区域的问题是合理的”。为什么联合国军方面不愿意如此，而坚持先谈什么条件以延宕时间呢？显然的，成立一个开城区中立化严格的协议，使停战谈判得以顺利进行不致再受阻挠中断这样一个重大而细致的工作，是必须要由双方代表指定一定的机构来加以处理，而不是一两个联络官所能担负的任务。为什么联合国军方面不把这样一个有关朝鲜停战、有关千百万人民的生命和安全的问题交给双方代表郑重处理，而推给联络官来阻挠停战会议的恢复呢？
    人们由此不能不得到一个结论，就是：联合国军方面在过去一个月中破坏停战谈判之后，现在又继续采取了新的阻挠战术，拖延谈判，以求达到其不可告人的目的。在过去一个月中美国政府指使联合国军采取了破坏停战谈判的战术来保持朝鲜的紧张局面，以便美国在旧金山会议中挟持其仆从国家在美国一手包办的对日和约上签字。现在它又在采取新的阻挠战术来保持朝鲜的紧张局势，以利于它在十一月初联合国大会开会时蛮横地处理关于远东方面的一系列的问题。据法新社华盛顿九月二十二日电，华盛顿的所谓消息灵通方面正在担心“这次联合国大会的显著情况，恐将是共产党集团争取共产党中国加入联合国的新努力”；并且由于“亚洲国家来联合美国以阻挠这种努力是无望的”而担心“共产党集团”的“胜利”，因此，他们决心要阻挠并拖延朝鲜停战谈判。那个所谓消息灵通方面在担忧了上述的问题之后，又一相情愿地希望中国问题不会在联合国大会上提出来，因为他们认为“事实上完全不能确定朝鲜战争在十一月初可以停止”，并且因为他们希望“假如保守党在十月二十五日的总选举中取得胜利的话，英国对共产党中国的态度可能改变。”由此种种，根据美国专栏作家蔡尔德于九月十九日在华盛顿邮报发表的专栏，美国国务院竟发现了一种奇怪的关于停战的看法：他们“认为一个战事实际上已告停顿状态，即使未经双方批准正式停战，也算等于停战。”换句话说，美国国务院不愿意有一个停战协定来使朝鲜的紧张状态得以和缓，而愿意把目前的状态拖延下去，以便于他们在外交上使用手脚。
    但是美帝国主义这种新的拖延谈判的阻挠战术是行不通的。人民，包括美国军队，要求停战，要求恢复停战谈判的压力加上美国帝国主义内部的困难和矛盾，将要使他们的新的阴谋碰壁。
