Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, 23rd: The entire command and fighters of the Xikang Military Region's Basic Third Regiment—the Yi People's Regiment of the Zhaojue County Yi Autonomous Region—wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the eve of National Day. The letter stated:

    Dear Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, on the eve of celebrating the great National Day of our motherland, we wish you both eternal health. Although we are separated from you by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are with you both. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Yi people lived an inhuman existence, unable to eat their fill or keep warm. They also incited us to fight senseless feuds, and there was nowhere to turn when loved ones died. None of us come from anything other than poor families. Seeing the good times after liberation, we truly laugh even in our dreams. It has only been a little over a year since the liberation of the Greater Liang Mountains, but the world has completely changed, and the Yi people have risen from hell. Last year, you sent a delegation to comfort us and helped us establish an autonomous government; with the help of the People's Liberation Army, we also established the first people's army in the history of our Yi people—the Yi People's Regiment. How can we not be grateful to you both when we think of these things?

    For more than half a year, under the leadership and education of the Communist Party and higher authorities, we have gradually been trained to become strong people's soldiers. Han comrades care for us even more than our own brothers. We are working hard together to learn. Now everyone has learned the letters and pinyin of the new script, and our political and military knowledge has also improved. More than 40 models have emerged in learning and labor. The more progress we make, the more we feel the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, and the more grateful we are to you both for bringing us happiness.

    National Day is coming soon, and we guarantee to you both that the Yi people will always follow the Communist Party, resolutely master our skills, learn from the veteran PLA comrades, strive to be good soldiers of Mao Zedong, and consolidate the national defense of our motherland. Now, American imperialism is expanding its conspiracy of aggression, and we Yi people will never allow it to invade our great motherland. We are determined to be with our brothers of all ethnic groups, and if the enemy dares to invade, we will defeat them!

    国庆日前夕写信给毛主席朱总司令
    感谢解放军帮助建立了第一支彝族人民的军队
    坚决保证练好本领巩固国防做毛泽东的好战士
    【新华社雅安二十三日电】中国人民解放军西康军区基干第三团——昭觉县彝族自治区彝民团全体指挥员和战斗员，在国庆日前夕写信给毛主席、朱总司令。信上说：
    亲爱的毛主席、朱总司令，我们在庆祝伟大祖国的国庆日前夕，祝福您俩永远健康。我们虽然和您俩远隔千山万水，但我们的心都向着您俩。在国民党反动派统治下，彝族人民过的就不是人的日子，吃不饱，穿不暖。他们还挑拨我们打冤家，死了亲人也没处去说。我们中间没有一个不是穷苦人家出身的。我们看着解放后的好光景，真是从梦里也要笑醒来。大凉山解放才一年多，但是天地都完全变了，彝族人民已经从地狱里站了起来。去年你派了访问团来慰问我们，又帮助我们建立了自治政府；在解放军的帮助下，又建立了我们彝族历史上的第一支人民军队——彝民团。想到这些，我们怎能不感激您俩呢？
    半年多来，在共产党和上级的领导和教育下，我们已逐渐锻炼成为坚强的人民战士了。汉族同志关心我们真比亲兄弟还亲，我们正在一起努力学习。现在大家都学会了新文字的字母和拼音，政治、军事知识也都提高了，在学习和劳动中还涌现了四十多个模范。我们愈有进步，就愈感到祖国的伟大可爱，愈感激您俩带给我们的幸福。
    国庆节就要到了，我们向您俩保证，彝族人民永远跟着共产党走，坚决练好本领，向解放军老大哥看齐，争取做毛泽东的好战士，巩固祖国国防。现在，美帝国主义正在扩大侵略阴谋，我们彝族人民决不容许它来侵犯我们伟大的祖国。我们坚决和各族兄弟在一起，敌人如果敢来侵犯，我们就要打败它！
