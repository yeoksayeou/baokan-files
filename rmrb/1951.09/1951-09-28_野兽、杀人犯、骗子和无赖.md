    Beasts, Murderers, Swindlers, and Scoundrels

    In the war of aggression against Korea and the Korean armistice negotiations, American aggressors have not only shown themselves to be brutal murderers and bandits, but also despicable and shameless swindlers and scoundrels.

    According to a report on September 24th by Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British London Daily Worker, when the Chinese and Korean representatives suggested immediately resuming the Korean armistice negotiations, the American and Rhee bandit troops in Korea deceived and forced twenty-five Korean children between the ages of twelve and fifteen to accept "training" and act as spies. Eleven of these children were sent to the neutral zone of the armistice negotiations and the area north of Kaesong to collect military intelligence. While crossing the boundary into the neutral zone, they were discovered and captured by sentries. Thus, this despicable and shameful act of the American aggressors and their South Korean puppet army was exposed before the people of the world.

    People know that American aggressors have massively slaughtered and continue to slaughter peaceful people of Korea on the Korean battlefield, destroying and continuing to destroy peaceful towns and villages of Korea. From this, people know that American aggressors are incomparably brutal beasts. People also know that American aggressors have demonstrated an extremely arrogant and unreasonable attitude in the Korean negotiations, and after the crimes of intruding into the neutral zone to murder our military police and attempting to assassinate our negotiating representatives from the air at night, as well as the continuous intrusion of American aircraft and ground forces into the Kaesong neutral zone, were exposed, they desperately and shamelessly denied their undeniable crimes of murdering negotiating representatives and sabotaging the neutral zone agreement. From this, people know that American aggressors are also arrogant and despicable murderers and bandits. This time, the American and Rhee bandit troops forcing Korean children to act as spies makes people know that American aggressors are also despicable and shameless swindlers and scoundrels.

    野兽、杀人犯、骗子和无赖
    美国侵略者在侵略朝鲜的战争中及朝鲜停战谈判中，不仅表现了它们是凶残的杀人犯和匪盗，而且还表现了它们是下流无耻的骗子和无赖。
    据英国伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿九月二十四日的报道，在中朝代表建议立即恢复朝鲜停战谈判的时候，朝鲜的美李匪军曾哄骗并逼迫由十二岁至十五岁的二十五个朝鲜孩子接受“训练”，充当间谍，其中被派往停战谈判中立区及开城以北地区搜集军事情报的十一个孩子，在越界进入中立区时，被岗哨查觉捕获了。这样，美国侵略者及其南朝鲜傀儡军队的这一卑鄙下流的勾当，就在世界人民的面前被揭露了。
    人们知道，美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上大规模地屠杀了并继续屠杀着朝鲜的和平人民，毁灭并继续毁灭着朝鲜和平的城镇和乡村，由此人们知道，美国侵略者是凶残无比的野兽；人们同样知道，美国侵略者在朝鲜谈判中表现了极其蛮横无理的态度，并且在侵入中立区谋杀我方军事警察，在夜间从空中企图谋杀我方谈判代表以及美国飞机和地面部队不断侵入开城中立区的罪行被揭穿后，又极力无耻地抵赖它们无法抵赖的谋杀谈判代表和破坏中立区协议的罪行，由此人们知道，美国侵略者还是蛮横卑鄙的杀人犯和匪盗；这次美李匪军逼迫朝鲜孩子充当间谍的勾当，又使人们知道，美国侵略者同时也是下流无耻的骗子和无赖。
