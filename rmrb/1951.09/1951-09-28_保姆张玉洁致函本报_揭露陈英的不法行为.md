    Housekeeper Zhang Yujie writes to this newspaper, exposing Chen Ying's illegal acts
    To the Editor:
    My name is Zhang Yujie. When I was five months pregnant, I came to work as a maid in the home of Comrade Chen Ying, the head of the Propaganda Section of the Tianjin Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration. After I gave birth, Comrade Chen Ying forced me to give my child away, which led to my child's death from illness, and I also developed gynecological problems.
    When I first arrived at her home in January of this year, I told her that I was already five months pregnant and could not do heavy work. She said, "We'll talk about it later!" I had just given birth and originally wanted to wait until the child was a month old before giving it away, but Chen Ying forced me to give the child to Wang Deyu, a railway worker. In late July, my child died of diarrhea and convulsions. Wang Deyu sent someone to bring me 200,000 yuan and comforted me. Although I was heartbroken by the death of my child, I was very grateful to the Wang family. I didn't want the Wang family's money. But Chen Ying persuaded me to keep it, saying, "It should have been sent long ago." She thought my child was worth some money!
    Before I went into labor, my husband asked to come and take care of me. Chen Ying, afraid of increasing her burden, refused. After I gave birth, no one took care of me. Chen Ying took two days off to stay at home. When she cooked, she had me hold her child.
    Three people couldn't lie on one bed, so I had to put her child on my stomach. I didn't want to bother her to take care of me, so I got out of bed to work that day. As a result, I often bled heavily from my lower body. She said, "It's always like this during postpartum confinement," and wouldn't let me get treatment.
    Due to lack of rest after childbirth and poor nutrition, my health was very bad, and my milk dried up after two months. Chen Ying then found a woman who had just given birth four days earlier to breastfeed her child.
    She had previously said that if I breastfed her child, she would cover my delivery expenses. My delivery cost a total of 170,000 yuan, but she only agreed to give me 33,000 yuan. I said, "Doing things today should be reasonable and legal!" She then scolded me, "You poor people rely on blackmail for a living!" and told me to "pack up and get out." When she calculated my wages, I asked her, "How will you compensate me for breastfeeding for two months?" She said, "The child originally ate one and a half pounds of milk a day, and still eats one and a half pounds of milk after eating your milk. It's your bad luck!" Only when I was about to leave did her husband give me 40,000 yuan for milk money.
    To the Editor: I worked in Chen Ying's home for six months, and my spirit and health have been greatly damaged. I hope you can help me solve this problem.

    Editor's Note: This letter from Zhang Yujie was forwarded by the Women Workers' Committee of the Tianjin District Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union. After investigation by the committee, the situation is true. Chen Ying is a Communist Party member, but has serious exploitative ideas. She actually "builds her own happiness on the basis of 'making others suffer'," which is absolutely unacceptable. The Party and government leading organs of the Tianjin Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration are studying how to deal with this problem, which is very necessary. We hope to be informed of the results of the handling.

### 保姆张玉洁致函本报  揭露陈英的不法行为

    保姆张玉洁致函本报
    揭露陈英的不法行为编辑同志：
    我叫张玉洁。我在怀孕五个月的时候，到天津铁路管理局天津分局宣传科长陈英同志的家里做女佣人。在我生产以后，陈英同志逼迫我把孩子送掉，致使我的孩子病死，我也得了妇科病。
    我在今年一月刚到她家时，就告诉她我已怀孕五月，不能干重活。她说：“以后再说吧！”我刚生下孩子，原想让孩子满了月再送给人家，但陈英却逼迫我把孩子送给铁路职工王德玉。到七月下旬，我孩子因泻肚、抽疯病死了。王德玉托人给我送来二十万元钱，并安慰我。我虽然为孩子的死痛心，但对王家是非常感激的。我不要王家的钱。但陈英劝我留下，并说：“早就应该送来了。”她认为我的孩子换几个钱就行了！
    我临产前，丈夫要求来照顾我。陈英怕增加她的负担，拒绝了。我生产后，也没人照顾。陈英请了两天假在家。她做饭时，就把她的孩子让我抱着。
    一张床躺不下三个人，只好把她的孩子放在我肚子上。我不便让她照顾，当天就下地做事。这样，我下部就常大量流血。她说“月子里总是这样”，也不让我治病。
    因生产缺乏休息，加上营养不良，我身体很坏，两个月后，我的奶就没了。陈英又找了一个刚生下小孩四天的产妇来喂她的孩子。
    她在以前曾说，我替她奶孩子，她就为我负担生产的费用。我生产共花了十七万元，她只答应给我三万三千元。我说：“今天做事应该合理合法！”她就骂我：“你们穷人就凭讹人吃饭！”叫我“卷上铺盖滚”。她给我算工钱时，我问她：“我喂了两个月的奶，怎么算啊？”她说：“孩子原来每天吃一磅半牛奶，吃了你的奶，还是吃一磅半牛奶。你活该倒霉！”直到临走时，她丈夫才给了我四万元奶费。
    编辑同志：我在陈英家做了六个月事情，精神、健康都受到很大摧残，希望你们帮我解决这个问题。
           张玉洁
    编者按：张玉洁这封信，是中国铁路工会天津区委员会女工工作委员会转来的。经过该会调查，情况属实。陈英是个共产党员，但有严重的剥削思想。她竟“把自己的幸福建筑在‘使别人受痛苦’的基础上”，这是绝对不能容许的。天津铁路管理局天津分局党政领导机关，正在研究处理这个问题，非常必要。希望把处理结果告诉我们。
