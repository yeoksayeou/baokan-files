As of now, according to incomplete statistics, the people of the entire region have paid over RMB 241,699,900,000. Among them, some regions have completed or exceeded their original donation plans. For example, the people of Poyang County in Jiangxi Province had paid over RMB 15 billion by the end of August, completing the original plan to donate a fighter plane. People from all walks of life in the county decided to donate two more fighter planes and plan to pay all the donations by the end of October. The people of Xiangyin County in Hunan Province paid over RMB 18.3 billion by the end of August, exceeding the donation plan for the "Ren Bishi's Hometown" plane.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st] People from all walks of life in Shanghai are enthusiastically paying increased production donations to welcome the second National Day. As of September 14th, the people of the city have paid a total of over RMB 158.4 billion, completing nearly one-third of the original donation plan.
    Workers throughout the city have donated over RMB 28.3 billion in production savings bonuses, completing more than one-third of the pledged donation plan. Workers from the three factories of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company under the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, in addition to donating part of their second-quarter bonus, totaling over RMB 320 million, are now working hard to complete the "Shanghai Steel Workers" fighter plane ahead of schedule. Chen Ronggen's lathe group of the private Chengfu Iron Factory launched a labor competition after formulating a donation plan and patriotic pact, and has overfulfilled the first phase of the increased production donation plan for July and August, donating all bonuses and overtime wages. The workers of the group are now striving to exceed the original donation plan in September even more.
    In order to welcome National Day, the city's industrial and commercial circles collectively paid donations, having already paid over RMB 113.9 billion, completing more than one-quarter of the pledged donation plan. The rubber shoe and leather industry in the city took the lead in paying off all six months of donations in advance. At the collective payment meeting held by industrial and commercial people in the Yimiao District on the 19th to welcome National Day, most of them paid more than half of their pledged donations, and 350 households paid in full. The city's hardware industry and hardware commerce also recently held a collective payment meeting, at which over RMB 5 billion was paid.

    Northeast Employees Enthusiastically Launch Labor Competition
    Strive to Overfulfill the Production Increase and Savings Plan
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: In order to welcome National Day, employees in various parts of the Northeast are launching a warm labor competition to strive to overfulfill the production increase and savings plan. At the end of August, the workers of the Shenyang Clothing Factory No. 1, where the famous labor model Jiang Wanshou is located, and the Wang Yanlong workshop of the Shenyang Machine Factory No. 8, first challenged the employees of factories and mines in the Northeast to further develop the production increase and savings movement in celebration of National Day. Model groups and model workshops in state-owned and public factories and mines in various places responded enthusiastically and put forward competition plans based on the specific conditions of their units. The Zhang Yichang group of the Shenyang Chemical Plant plans to improve the working methods of making soybean oil in September, which can save wealth equivalent to 16 tons and 291 kilograms of grain, and strive to complete the production task in September two days ahead of schedule. The plan of the machine repair workshop of the Liaoyang Textile Factory is to ensure that the output in September is 10% higher than that in August, and to increase production and save wealth of ten tons of grain. Meng Tai's piping class, a savings model in a certain iron smelting plant, participated in this competition on the condition of saving the value of one hundred and thirty-seven and a half tons of grain in September. The Shi Yuhai group, the banner of safe production in Northeast coal mines, revised the original plan to exceed the production task by 7% in the second half of the year in the competition plan to exceed the task by 12%, and strive to increase production and save wealth of four hundred and eighty-three tons of grain by the end of the year. At present, this competition movement has been expanded from various model groups and advanced workshops to general groups and workshops, and will soon form a comprehensive and extensive mass movement. Many units that started the competition earlier have already achieved significant results. For example, the Chen Guojun group of Shenyang First Machine Factory completed the September production task in twelve days, and completed more than one-third of the group's increased production and savings task for half a year. Workers in the forging workshop of the Fushun Machinery Repair Factory completed 64.6% of the increased production and savings task of the entire workshop at the end of last month. Now they are further improving labor organization and shortening the production process of one process to ensure that the remaining increased production and savings tasks are completed before National Day.

    Armed Forces in Major Cities of East China Will Grandly Hold Military Parade on National Day
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] All commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate National Day. The armed forces stationed in major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Hangzhou, and Fuzhou will hold grand military parades on National Day and will invite representatives of local party and government agencies and people's organizations to attend the ceremony. The troops stationed in various places are also actively preparing to participate in the local people's demonstration parades and celebration meetings, and extensively carry out publicity activities.
    Before National Day, the units under the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army will universally and deeply carry out patriotic education. The broad commanders and fighters are determined to further accelerate the construction of a regularized and modernized national defense force through this study, and strive to smash the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism and defend the motherland and world peace.
    All units in the East China troops will hold celebration meetings on National Day. Newspapers of various levels of troops and commanders and fighters are writing wall newspapers to celebrate National Day. Various literary and artistic work groups, soldiers' drama troupes, and clubs have also begun rehearsing various celebration programs.

    Tianlan Railway Employees Set Goals
    Strive to Lay the Track Between Tianshui and Nanhechuan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] Tianlan Railway employees are striving to complete the 20-kilometer track laying project from Tianshui to Nanhechuan to welcome this year's National Day. This track laying project started on August 1st. The Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau plans to lay a 65-kilometer track from Tianshui to Gangu by the end of this year. After the start of construction, it encountered the rainy season, and the transportation of materials was very difficult. By September 16, only 12 kilometers had been laid. In order to welcome National Day, all employees proposed to rush to lay the track to Nanhechuan by the end of the month, and continue to work hard to resolutely complete this year's track laying plan.
    The construction project of the Tiangan section is very difficult. The line meanders westward along the winding Weihe River valley, and the road construction project has to be carried out on cliffs and cliffs in many places. There are 33 tunnels in the whole section, and the length accounts for half of the total length of all tunnels in the Tianlan Railway; in addition, there are two Weihe River bridges and 147 medium and small bridges. Among them, the construction project from Tianshui to Nanhechuan is the most difficult section of the entire line. Not only is the length of the tunnel equal to half of the Tiangan section, but the stone is too loose, and it is difficult to excavate the tunnel. All the road construction staff have come up with various methods to overcome various obstacles. For example, when excavating the Anlinshan Tunnel, there was no ventilation equipment in the cave, so they used galvanized iron tubes welded together to replace the blower. When excavating Tunnel No. 9, there were quicksand, loose stone, hard stone, weathered stone, soil-夹-stone and soil in the cave, especially in the quicksand part of more than 20 meters at the entrance. As soon as it was dug open, the sand泻down like water. After research by many railway engineering experts and workers, they came up with a way to block the hole with wooden boards and hemp bags filled with stone ballast, and slowly dig out the sand. After 20 days of hard work, they finally completed this extremely difficult tunnel project. (Attached picture)

    天兰铁路员工订出努力目标
    争取铺好天水南河川间轨道
    【新华社西安二十一日电】天兰铁路员工正争取完成天水到南河川二十公里铺轨工程，以迎接今年的国庆节。这一铺轨工程从八月一日开始。西北铁路干线工程局计划在今年年底前铺好从天水到甘谷共六十五公里长的轨道。开工后，碰上雨季，材料运输发生很大困难，到九月十六日，仅铺好十二公里。为迎接国庆节，全体员工提出赶月底一定铺到南河川，并继续努力坚决完成今年的铺轨计划。
    天甘段的修筑工程非常艰难。线路沿着弯弯曲曲的渭河河谷蜿蜒西进，筑路工程许多地方都要在悬崖绝壁间进行。全段有隧道三十三处，长度占天兰铁路全部隧道总长度的一半；另外，还有渭河大桥两座和中小桥梁一百四十七座。其中天水到南河川的修筑工程是全线最难修筑的一段，不但隧道长度等于天甘段的一半，而且石质太松，开凿隧道很困难。全体筑路员工曾想出各种办法，克服各种障碍。比如开凿安林山隧道时，洞内没有通风设备，他们就用洋铁筒焊在一起代替鼓风机。开凿九号隧道时，洞内有流沙、松石、坚石、风化石、土夹石和土，尤其在进口处二十多公尺的流沙部分，刚一挖开，沙子就像水似地泻下来。经过许多铁路工程专家和工人们研究之后，才想出用木板和装石碴的麻袋堵住洞子，慢慢地把沙掏出来，经过二十天的努力，终于完成了这一处万分艰巨的隧道工程。（附图片）
