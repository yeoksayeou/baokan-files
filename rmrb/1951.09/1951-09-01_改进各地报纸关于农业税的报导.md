    Improve Newspaper Coverage of the Agricultural Tax in Various Regions
    Li Chengrui

    The collection of the agricultural tax is a significant political task concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood. In the agricultural tax publicity work, our newspapers have played a huge role, to the extent that they have become an indispensable and important weapon in the agricultural tax work.
    However, if we strictly examine the publicity work regarding the agricultural tax, it is clear that there are still some shortcomings. Especially in the early and middle stages of the autumn collection last year, some local newspapers had certain non-political tendencies. After the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, this phenomenon has greatly changed, but this bias has not been systematically cleared from the ideological level. Therefore, it has not been completely overcome in this year's summer collection, and there is still a possibility of recurrence. Currently, various regions are carrying out land verification and production assessment work, and the autumn collection is also approaching. It is necessary to take this opportunity to conduct a preliminary review of the problems that existed in the past and put forward suggestions for future improvements.
    These biases, in their basic nature, are: instead of educating farmers with proletarian ideology, they lower the Party's standards to the level of the farmers. This is a reflection of peasant consciousness within the Party. What specific issues do these biases manifest in?
    First, some local newspapers have not handled the correct relationship between the immediate and local interests of the farmers and the long-term interests of the overall situation appropriately. For example, some newspapers are only willing to publicize "reducing the people's burden" but not willing to publicize "expanding the burden coverage." For example, in the publicity of "reducing the people's burden" (which was one of the country's financial guidelines before the start of the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign), more emphasis was placed on its economic significance, and not enough attention was paid to its political significance. Some newspapers enthusiastically publicized "this year's burden is universally reduced by a quarter" (a quarter is the national average, which varies from region to region). They did not emphasize the people's democratic government's meticulous care for the people; they did not emphasize that one of the important reasons for the reduction of the farmers' burden is that the working class strives to produce and increase the profits of state-owned enterprises, promoting the development of industry and commerce, thereby increasing urban tax revenue. They did not pay enough attention to enhancing the farmers' understanding of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance through this example. Some explained the reduction of the people's burden as passively reducing the amount of tax, without simultaneously pointing out that the people's government's commitment to developing production and increasing income is the basic and active way to reduce the people's burden. For example, regarding the issue of expanding the burden coverage, as early as February 28, 1950, the Government Administration Council had stipulated that the agricultural tax burden population should generally reach about 90 percent of the agricultural population. However, some newspapers have only been willing to publicize the benefits of rent reduction, deposit refunds, and land reform for farmers (economic benefits). They have not emphasized the principle that as the landlord economy weakens or disappears and the farmers' lives gradually improve, farmers should pay taxes to their government. When they occasionally touch upon it, it is often a brief mention, seemingly "not justified enough." For example, some newspapers have narrowly interpreted "taken from the people, used for the people." They overly emphasized citing examples such as "the province (or county) has distributed so much relief grain, lent grain," "a certain village paid 120,000 catties of public grain last year, but the government spent 150,000 catties to build a bridge in the village" (these examples can certainly be listed). However, they did not emphasize the use for national defense and comprehensive construction. Due to the influence of this kind of thinking and other reasons, after the burden was reduced in some places, the masses were dissatisfied. For example, they said: "He reduced it more, I reduced it less." Some individuals suggested: "It is enough for the public grain we pay to feed 500 'armed' personnel in our county, why so much?" Some tenant farmers neither pay rent nor are willing to pay public grain on behalf of the landlords. Some villages initially only paid public grain for self-cultivated land and not for tenanted land. Individual farmers once experienced serious phenomena unprecedented in history, such as returning or tearing up "grain strings" (tax payment notices issued by the government). In some old liberated areas, production has increased significantly compared to the war years, but some people are complaining endlessly about the current burden. The burden is reduced, the facts are all there, and it is universally acknowledged, but when the issue of burden is mentioned, even at the meetings discussing the burden, a phenomenon of "complaining about suffering, comparing suffering, evaluating suffering" is formed. The political atmosphere is extremely weak, and our Party newspapers lack a clear attitude towards these serious phenomena.
    Secondly, some newspapers are not good at distinguishing between proletarian ideology and peasant ideology in agricultural tax work. They fail to grasp the key points in criticizing the backward and selfish ideas of the farmers. According to years of experience, the struggle between the progressive and backward ideas of cadres and farmers in agricultural tax work is concentrated on three issues: (1) the honest reporting of farmland area, especially the honest reporting of yield; (2) the amount of reduction or exemption and whether to strictly pay taxes according to the rate; (3) the timely delivery of grain and the delivery of good grain. Among these three issues, the first issue is the most important. It is also the most acute and complex focus of ideological struggle. From the farmers' point of view, after the government has determined the tax rate, the amount of tax paid by each household depends on the amount of farmland and the level of yield ("determining yield is equal to determining tax"); from the government's point of view, whether the farmland area and yield can be verified is also the key to ensuring national income and implementing policies. However, many newspapers do not understand this simple principle. Their reports have a bias towards "emphasizing collection and neglecting investigation." They only pay attention to reporting collection, not to reporting land verification and production assessment. Some newspapers do not analyze and guide the ideology of cadres and the masses in land verification and production assessment work, and almost every day they repeat reports lacking ideological content such as "if one person conceals farmland, everyone suffers," "at the representatives' meeting, the thinking was straightened out." Here, we would like to point out that the Zhejiang Daily was worthy of learning in this regard last year. The newspaper first concentrated its efforts on reporting the issue of land verification and production assessment, and published an editorial "Solving Ideological Problems in Production Assessment Work," systematically criticizing five erroneous ideas such as "rather low than high" in production assessment work. Secondly, some newspapers promote empiricism in the publicity of methods for setting yield. They are still publicizing the old method of handicraft-style "democratic evaluation" by each township, and not publicizing the "investigation and production assessment" method in which the government proposes a plan through investigation and determines the yield through people's congresses at all levels. They seem to think that only the former method is the mass line, but it is only a reflection of the peasant small-producer ideology.
    Again, some local newspapers are not good at guiding the masses to consciously struggle for the implementation of the government's tax policies and laws. They do not fully understand that the people's government's agricultural tax regulations and instructions are the concrete manifestation of proletarian ideology in agricultural tax work at the present stage. Last year, many places experienced deviations from acting according to policies and laws, the so-called "fixed task, flexible tax rate," "fixed task, flexible yield," "fixed task, flexible reduction and exemption," etc. Many places did not reach the amount that should have been collected according to the tax rate. It is roughly estimated that the state collected about 500,000 tons less of public grain as a result. Is this not worthy of attention? But at that time, some local newspapers did not vigorously correct these deviations. Individual newspapers even promoted these deviations. The newspaper of a certain province publicized and introduced the example of completing the "task" (the "task" itself was subjective) by lowering the tax rate without authorization. Here, we would like to point out that the Changjiang Daily is worthy of learning in this regard. The newspaper published the editorial "Correcting Several Erroneous Ideas in the Autumn Collection," which ideologically criticized various deviations from acting according to policies and laws, and played a great role. The Zhejiang Daily's "Summary of the Autumn Collection Work of Thirteen Key Point Townships in Jinhua Prefecture" put forward specific practices for collection work, and focused on analyzing the law of ideological changes of cadres and the masses, and put forward the main problems in ideological leadership, which is also worth promoting.
    Again, some newspapers are not good at combining the enthusiasm of the masses for delivering grain with correct organizational work. It is manifested in: generally advocating "fast delivery," and individual newspapers blindly publicizing methods such as "delivering grain in the dark," "mobilizing in the rain," and "evaluating and sending at the same time." However, they have not vigorously promoted orderly and organized delivery and handover of grain. Last year, in many areas, the masses mobilized all at once to deliver grain, causing traffic congestion, and the warehouses could not receive it in time, wasting manpower and material resources, and even causing unfortunate incidents of human and animal casualties, which in turn affected the enthusiasm of the masses for delivering grain. Last year, due to the overly hasty delivery of grain during the autumn collection, the millet in many places was not dried and had excessive moisture, causing serious losses to the state. If the moisture content is reduced to the safe standard of 13 percent, the difference is equal to 250,000 tons of public grain. Is this not worthy of vigilance? We should educate and lead the farmers with the proletariat's organization, and should not promote unorganized chaos.
    The publicity work in this year's summer collection has made great progress. Universal attention has been paid to patriotic political propaganda, but it is not thorough enough. Some newspapers have not placed the reports of land verification and production assessment in the due position. Some reports are still spreading the backward production assessment methods of handicraft-style "self-evaluation by each township" that have already been criticized. Some newspapers have not correctly combined patriotic enthusiasm with the implementation of policies and laws, so that the masses' grain delivery movement is not only highly conscious, but also highly organized.
    I believe that the following issues should be paid attention to in future publicity:
    First, further deepen the patriotic political propaganda and overcome certain generalized and formalistic deviations in political propaganda; report the ideas of farmers with different levels of awareness on the burden issue, and analyze and improve them; continue to publicize the significance of expanding the burden coverage; in areas where land reform has just been completed this year, the initial burden of newly landed farmers should be the focus of publicity.
    Second, raise the reporting of land verification and production assessment work to the primary position in agricultural tax reporting; under the slogan of "patriotic farmers should honestly report farmland area and honestly report yield," analyze the various ideas of cadres and the masses in land verification and production assessment (especially in production assessment), educate farmers with proletarian ideology, report the correct experience of "investigation and production assessment," and criticize the old set of handicraft-style "self-evaluation by each township."
    Third, under the glorious slogan of "paying taxes according to the rate is the glorious obligation of the people," publicize calculating and collecting taxes according to the rate, and reducing or exempting taxes according to the law, criticize the incorrect practice of "fixed task, flexible tax rate," and report and publicize the benefits and implementation experience of calculating and collecting taxes according to the rate and reducing or exempting taxes according to the law.
    Fourth, under the slogan of "patriotic farmers deliver good grain on time," report typical experiences of planned and organized delivery and receipt of grain, criticize the disorderly practices of blindly seeking speed and the phenomenon of not paying attention to grain quality.
    To achieve the above points is naturally not an easy task. It requires the editors and correspondents of the newspapers to improve their Marxist-Leninist ideological level, study tax policies and laws; it requires close contact with the masses through "social activist" style correspondents; it requires close cooperation between newspapers and the government. Only in this way can we cooperate with all parties to create a patriotic grain delivery movement with high consciousness and high organization, not only to complete the task of collecting public grain, but also to further strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    改进各地报纸关于农业税的报导
    李成瑞
    农业税的征收工作是一个关乎国计民生的重大的政治任务。在农业税的宣传工作中，我们的报纸发挥了巨大的作用，以致成为农业税工作中必不可少的重要武器。
    但是如果严格检查一下关于农业税工作的宣传工作，很显然还存在着若干缺点，特别在去年秋征的初期和中期，有些地方报纸曾存在过某些非政治化倾向。在抗美援朝运动开展之后，这种现象已大有转变，但是还没有从思想上系统地清算过这种偏向；因而在今年夏征中也就没有彻底克服，而且还潜存着复发的可能。目前正值各地开展查田定产工作，秋征亦将到来，趁此时机把过去存在的问题作
    一初步检查，并提出今后改进的意见，是必要的。
    这些偏向从基本性质上说就是：它不是以无产阶级思想教育农民，而把党的水平降低到农民的水平，这是农民意识在党内的反映。这种偏向表现在那些具体问题上呢？
    首先有些地方报纸对于农民的眼前的局部利益和全局的长远利益的正确关系，处理得还不十分恰当。比如：有的报纸只愿宣传“减轻民负”而不愿宣传“扩大负担面”；比如：在“减轻民负”（这是抗美援朝开始以前国家的财政方针之一）的宣传上，比较着重其经济意义，而对其政治意义，则注意还不很够。有些报纸津津有味地宣传“今年负担普遍减轻四分之一”（四分之一是全国平均数，具体到各地区，有所不同。）没有更着重地说明人民民主政权对人民的无微不至的关怀；没有着重说明农民负担减轻的重要原因之一，是工人阶级努力生产提高国营企业利润，促使工商业发展因而增加城市税收的结果。没有十分注意通过这一事例提高农民对巩固人民民主专政，加强工农联盟的认识。有的对于减轻民负，解释为消极地减少税额，而没有同时指出人民政府致力于发展生产增加收入是减轻民负的基本的积极的办法。又比如关于扩大负担面问题，早在一九五○年二月二十八日政务院即已规定农业税负担人口一般应达到农业人口百分之九十左右，但有些报纸一直只愿意宣传减租、退押，土地改革对农民的好处（经济上的好处），关于地主经济削弱或消灭，农民生活逐步改善的情况下，农民应当对自己的政府交纳赋税的道理，却没有着重宣传，偶一触及，往往是轻描淡写，似乎“不够理直气壮”似的。又比如：有些报纸对于“取之于民用之于民”作了狭隘的解释，他们过于着重引用“本省（或本县）发放了多少救济粮，贷粮”，“某村去年交公粮十二万斤，但政府在该村修桥一座，即花去十五万斤”等例子（这种实例当然是可以列举的），却没有着重说明国防和全面建设方面的用途，由于这种思想的影响和其他种种原因，有些地方负担减轻之后，群众反而不满，如说：“他减的多，我减的少。”个别的提出：“交的公粮够我们县里五百个‘
    武装’人员吃就行了，为什么要这么多？”有的佃农既不交租，也不愿代地主交公粮；有的村庄农民开始时只交自耕地的公粮不交佃耕的公粮，个别的农民一度发生退回或撕毁“粮串”（政府所发的纳税通知书）等历史上所没有过的严重现象。某些老解放区，生产较之战争时期提高了不少，却有人对现在的负担叫苦不迭。负担减轻，事实俱在，众所公认，但
    一提及负担问题甚至在讨论负担的会议上形成“诉苦，比苦，评苦”的现象，政治气氛极其淡薄，而我们的党报对这些严重的现象却缺乏明确的态度。
    其次，有些报纸还不善于区分农业税工作中的无产阶级思想和农民思想，对于农民中的落后，自私思想的批判抓不住要害，根据历年的体会，在农业税工作中干部与农民的进步思想与落后思想的斗争集中在三个问题上：（一）关于实报田亩，特别是实报产量问题；（二）关于减免多少和是否严格依率交税问题；（三）关于按时交粮和交好粮的问题。在这三个问题中，第一个问题是关系最重大的问题。也是思想斗争最尖锐最复杂的焦点。从农民来说，在政府已经确定税率之后，每户纳税的多少，就决定于田亩的多少和产量的高低（“定产等于定税”）；从政府方面说，田亩产量的能否查实，也成为国家收入能否保证，政策能否贯彻的关键。但是，许多报纸不了解这个浅显道理，在报导上存在着“重征收轻调查”的偏向，只注意报导征收，不注意报导查田定产，有的报纸对于查田定产工作中的干部和群众思想没有分析和指导，几乎每天重复着“一人瞒田，大家吃亏”，“各界代表会上，打通了思想”之类缺乏思想性的报导。在这里，我们愿意举出：去年浙江日报在这一问题上是值得学习的。该报首先集中力量报导查田定产问题，并发表了社论
    “解决定产工作中的思想问题”，系统地批判了定产工作中“宁低勿高”等五种错误思想。其次，有的报纸对于订定产量的方法的宣传上，存在着经验主义，至今仍在宣传各乡自行“民主评议”的手工业式的老办法，而不去宣传由政府经过调查，提出方案通过各级人民代表会订定产量的“调查定产”的办法。他们似乎认为只有前一种办法，才是群众路线，其实不过是农民小生产者思想的反映罢了。
    再次，有些地方报纸还不善于引导群众自觉地为实现政府的税收政策和法令而斗争，还不完全了解人民政府的农业税条例、指示，就是现阶段无产阶级思想在农业税工作中的具体表现。去年不少地方发生不按政策办事，不按法令办事的偏向，即所谓“死任务活税率”、“死任务活产量”、“死任务活减免”等等，许多地方没有达到按照税率应当征收的数量，大体估计，国家因此而少收的公粮约在五十万吨以上，这还不值得注意么？但在当时某些地方报纸，没有大力纠正这些偏向，个别报纸还助长这些偏向，某省的报纸，竟把擅自降低税率而完成“任务”（这个“任务”本身是主观的）的事例，加以宣扬和介绍，在这里我们愿意举出：在这一问题上，长江日报是值得学习的，该报发表了“纠正秋征中的几种错误思想”的社论，从思想上批判了不按政策法令办事的种种偏向，起了很大的作用。浙江日报“金华专区十三个基点乡的秋征工作总结”，提出了征收工作的具体做法，并着重分析了干部和群众思想变化的规律，提出了思想领导中的主要问题，也是值得发扬的。
    再次，有些报纸还不善于把群众的交粮热情和正确的组织工作结合起来。表现在：一般地提倡“快交”，个别报纸盲目宣扬“黑夜交粮”、“冒雨出动”、“边评边送”等办法，却没有大力提倡有秩序有组织的送粮和交粮。去年许多地区，群众交粮动辄一齐出动，路途拥塞，仓库接收不及，浪费了人力物力，甚至造成人畜伤亡的不幸事件，反过来又影响了群众交粮热情。去年秋征中因交粮过于仓促，许多地方的谷子未及晒干，水分过大，造成国家的严重损失，如将水分降低到百分之十三的安全标准，其差额等于二十五万吨公粮，这还不值得警惕吗？我们应该以无产阶级的组织性去教育和领导农民，而不应当提倡无组织的混乱状态。
    在今年夏征中的宣传工作已有了很大的进步，普遍注意了爱国主义的政治宣传，但还不够深入，有些报纸还没有把查田定产的报导放在应有地位，有些报导还在传播已经受到批判的手工业式的“各乡自评”的落后的评产方法；有些报纸还没有把爱国热情和政策法令的贯彻实施正确结合起来，使群众的交粮运动不仅具有高度的自觉性，而且具有高度的组织性。
    我以为今后的宣传中应注意下述几个问题：
    第一，进一步深入爱国主义的政治宣传，克服政治宣传中某些一般化形式化的偏向；报导不同觉悟的农民对负担问题的思想，并加以分析和提高；继续宣传扩大负担面的意义；在今年刚刚完成土地改革的地区，新得地农民初次负担，应作为宣传的重点。
    第二，把查田定产工作的报导提高到农业税报导中的首要地位，在“爱国农民要实报田亩实报产量”的口号下，分析查田定产中（特别是定产中）干部与群众的种种思想，以无产阶级思想教育农民，报导“调查定产”的正确经验，批判“各乡自评”的手工业式的老一套的作法。
    第三，在“依率交税是人民的光荣义务”的光荣口号下，宣传依率计征，依法减免，批判“死任务活税率”的不正确做法，报导和宣传依率计征，依法减免的好处及实施经验。
    第四，在“爱国农民按时交好粮”的口号下，报导有计划有组织的交粮和收粮的典型经验，批判盲目图快的无秩序的做法和不注意粮质的现象。
    要做到以上几点，自然不是一件容易事，它需要报纸的编辑工作人员和通讯员，提高马列主义的思想水平，钻研税收政策和法令；需要通过“社会活动家”式的通讯员，密切与群众的联系；需要报纸与政府的密切配合，通力合作，这样，才能配合各方力量造成有高度自觉性和高度组织性的爱国交粮运动，不仅完成公粮的征收任务并把人民民主专政更加强化，把工农联盟更加巩固起来。
