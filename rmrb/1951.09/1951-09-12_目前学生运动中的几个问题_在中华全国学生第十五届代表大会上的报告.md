Several Issues in the Current Student Movement
    — Report at the 15th National Student Congress
    Jiang Nanxiang
    It has been more than two years since the 14th National Student Congress was convened in March 1949. In these two years, our country has made unprecedented progress in all aspects; China's student movement has also achieved great success. Now I would like to offer some opinions on a few issues that the current student movement should focus on.
    I. Popularizing and Deepening Patriotic Ideological Education Among Students Nationwide

    Since the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese student movement has maintained a glorious patriotic tradition. After the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the patriotic spirit of Chinese students has been further developed.
    The high patriotic spirit of Chinese students is manifested in welcoming and assisting the People's Liberation Army's advance in the early days of liberation; participating in the takeover work of newly liberated cities; conducting enthusiastic ideological remolding movements; actively participating in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement; supporting land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; students of church schools warmly supporting the People's Government's measures to take over church schools; university graduates obeying the government's unified job assignments; students nationwide twice responding to the People's Government's call and enthusiastically joining military cadre schools; and so on. The patriotic spirit and level of awareness demonstrated by students nationwide through the above practical actions are unprecedented for students of the old era.
    However, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. Patriotic ideological education cannot be said to have been completely popularized, let alone sufficiently deepened. Now, American imperialism is adopting various despicable and shameless methods in an attempt to harm our country. The nationwide Resist America, Aid Korea movement is being carried out enthusiastically. For the sake of the motherland's needs, we must further popularize and deepen patriotic ideological education among students nationwide.
    That is to say, we must also systematically and gradually promote patriotic ideological education so that every student in every school across the country receives the ideological baptism of patriotism. We must also improve the ideological content of patriotic education, so that the spirit of patriotism is built on a solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which can more deeply enlighten the awareness of the broad masses of students and more powerfully push China's student movement forward.
    The influence of the great victory of the new China has spread to the farthest corners of the earth, inspiring the victorious confidence of hundreds of millions of people around the world. However, within our own country, there are still a very small number of students who are blind to the great achievements of the great motherland and have no feeling about them. They still retain the ideological appearance of the old China, treating the various great changes and creations of the new China with indifference or even with certain prejudices. We must use the ideological brilliance of patriotism to illuminate these last dark corners in schools, so that every student in the new China is worthy of being a youth of the Mao Zedong era and does not disappoint the expectations of the people and the cultivation of the country, becoming a heroic defender and active builder of the great motherland.
    We should enthusiastically carry out the work of promoting patriotic ideological education in church schools and among religious students. In the new China, the Chinese people have freedom of religious belief, but imperialist elements cannot be allowed to use religious belief to harm the interests of our motherland. Students who believe in religion, like other students across the country, live and breathe on the land of the motherland, and are protected and educated by the country. They have an obligation to cherish their great motherland and the hardworking and brave people of the motherland! An upright student with religious beliefs should first and foremost be a patriot, and then a religious believer. In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, some religious students enthusiastically joined military cadre schools and resolutely took up defense construction posts. Their patriotic actions are a shining example for religious students.
    We should strengthen the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among students nationwide. Some students are patriotic in words, but cannot withstand the test of practical action. They show an unstable stance in the land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; when the People's Government calls for participation in military cadre schools, they express hesitation and fear; they express certain reservations or even resistance to obeying the government's job assignments after graduation; they cannot distinguish between enemies and friends and lack internationalist spirit; they do not care about politics and only want to be experts; and so on. All these shortcomings essentially stem from one source: taking personal interests rather than the interests of the motherland and the people as the starting point for considering problems. Only proletarian collectivism, only Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, can overcome the various incorrect old ideas and old habits in our minds. Therefore, to become thorough patriots, we must arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    To popularize and deepen patriotic ideological education, we must make clear to students nationwide two most fundamental issues in their thinking: First, we must draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution; second, we must recognize the difference between working-class ideology and non-working-class ideology.
    Why is it necessary to draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution? Because we must first distinguish who is the enemy and who is the friend. We adopt a firm policy of unity towards friends. We must carry out a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against the enemies of the people - imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. We must not only severely criticize various reactionary propaganda that harms the people and strive to eliminate the remaining feudal, comprador, and fascist influences in students' minds, but also be responsible for exposing saboteurs who are hidden in schools and carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, and remove them from the schools. People's schools are for cultivating talents for the construction of the new China, and counter-revolutionary elements cannot be allowed to exist and become a scourge. Of course, the targets we want to cleanse are only the scum among the students, a very small number of hopeless and extremely degenerate elements. For ordinary students who are ideologically more backward, education and transformation should still be the principle.
    "Drawing a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution" is to correctly solve the problem of unity in China's student movement. The new China, which has won the victory of the People's Revolution, has the necessity and possibility to expand the scale of the student movement as much as possible, so that the student movement in our country becomes a factor in promoting all students, not just some students, to progress. This requires, on the one hand, establishing the broadest unity of students nationwide on the ideological basis of patriotism and on the basis of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and on the other hand, accurately and forcefully isolating and打击 [attack and strike] counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the student ranks. That is to say, the boundary that students nationwide use to distinguish between their enemies and friends should only be the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, and not any other differences.
    Some people do not clearly emphasize the boundary between revolution and counter-revolution, but consciously or unconsciously emphasize other boundaries, such as emphasizing the boundary between Party and League members and non-Party and League members in schools, and the boundary between religious and non-religious believers, thus preventing the establishment of good cooperative relations between Party members, League members, and ordinary students, and between religious and non-religious students. In some land reform areas, there is also the phenomenon of indiscriminately excluding students from non-worker-peasant families in schools, which is a repetition of errors that have occurred many times in the past. These phenomena should be corrected.
    Only by first drawing a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution can we correctly and widely unite students nationwide under the banner of patriotism and move forward together.
    Why is it necessary to recognize the difference between working-class ideology and non-working-class ideology? Because the new China under the people's democratic dictatorship has different classes and different ideologies that represent the interests of different classes. Students nationwide must recognize what ideology is completely correct and needs to be studied well; what ideology is incorrect or not completely correct and should be criticized and improved. China is now implementing New Democracy construction and will move towards socialism and communism in the future; students in the new China must not only become builders of the New Democratic society but also become builders of socialist and communist societies. Therefore, history has put forward a solemn requirement to students nationwide, requiring students nationwide not only to have a fervent patriotic heart, but also to strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to make themselves have a high level of communist awareness to adapt to the construction needs of the new China today and tomorrow.
    "Recognizing the difference between working-class ideology and non-working-class ideology" is to correctly solve the problem of leadership in China's student movement. Students nationwide should use the ideology of the working class, rather than any other ideology, as the highest standard to guide their study and work. The new China has won victory under the leadership of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and the student movement in the new China should and must also advance victoriously under the leadership of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the guide to our revolutionary action, and also the guide to our study of various sciences. True science is a summary of human beings' objective laws of nature or society to a certain extent and scope. We study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, master dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and then we can obtain the sharpest ideological weapons to correctly dissect the various complex phenomena of nature and human society, thereby opening up the broadest path of development for all our scientific research. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have shown invincible power in our country's great revolutionary movement. Undoubtedly, it must also be developed into various scientific fields to create great victories for our scientific research work.
    However, it must be pointed out that thoroughly comprehending Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is a process that requires a long period of study and practice, and it is absolutely impossible to fully achieve the goal in a year and a half, or even three to five years. Students nationwide must attach importance to the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, this is one aspect; we must admit the long-term nature of learning, and not be too hasty, this is another aspect. If we demand that students nationwide fully grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in a very short period of time, and demand that all kinds of non-proletarian thoughts among students nationwide be completely eliminated in a very short period of time, that is impossible, and therefore inappropriate. Forcibly doing so regardless of objective reality will cause problems and create biases. After liberation, many universities across the country implemented inappropriate "ideological summaries," hoping to "thoroughly defeat the non-proletarian thoughts in schools" through short, intensive assaults. This impetuous and rude approach proved to be unrealistic and wrong, and this type of error should not be repeated in the future.
    II. Striving to Improve the Knowledge Level of Students Nationwide

    As builders of the new China, we must not only have ideas of loving the motherland, but also have abundant knowledge. Students nationwide should strive to improve their knowledge level on the ideological basis of patriotism.
    In the era of reactionary rule, it was not possible to put forward the slogan of "improving the knowledge level of students" in the revolutionary student movement. In the old schools of the old ruling era, putting forward this slogan could only be a shift in the main struggle goals of students. In the new China, which has won the revolution, "improving the knowledge level of students" has extremely important practical significance.
    For the new society to thoroughly defeat the old society and maintain victory forever, it must have an economic and cultural level far surpassing that of the old society. Therefore, we require workers in the new China to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity in labor, to have a labor productivity far higher than that of the old China era, and to ensure the rapid development of productive forces. We also require students in the new China to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity in learning, so that students in the new China have a higher level of knowledge than students in the old China, in order to adapt to the needs of the great construction cause of the new China. Striving to learn useful knowledge for building the new China is a concrete manifestation of patriotism for students in our country.
    Improving the knowledge level of students, of course, requires relying on the leadership of government education departments and the specific guidance of teachers, such as stabilizing the learning order of schools, appropriately reforming the school system curriculum, editing and approving correct textbooks, adjusting the departments of schools, improving the teaching staff, improving teaching methods, appropriately stipulating students' work and rest time, etc. These are all problems that must be solved in order to improve the effectiveness of school education. In this regard, the People's Government is working hard and has achieved results; but it must go through a longer process of reform and improvement to completely solve the above series of problems.
    In addition, improving the knowledge level of students must also rely on the efforts of the students themselves. From the students' point of view, this is something that they can do at any time, and is therefore a more important aspect. If you work hard yourself, you can gain more knowledge even if the learning conditions in other aspects are poor. If you don't work hard yourself, you won't learn well even if the learning conditions are good.
    In some places and some schools, the emphasis is not on learning but on work, believing that "work comes first, learning comes second," and openly calling on students to devote 70% of their energy to doing "Party and government central work" outside the school, and even treating students as "mobile cadres" to be called upon at any time. - This view and this practice are wrong. It is obvious without proof that schools are places where students are systematically taught knowledge, not work teams; students come to school to learn knowledge that can be used to serve the country in the future, not current employees on supply or salary. Except in very special circumstances in the early days of liberation, where it was necessary and appropriate to absorb students to participate in more extracurricular activities or off-campus work, we should not forget that "the basic task of students is to study," just as we should not forget that "the basic task of workers is to produce." In some schools, some students, especially some Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, actually deny the necessity of students learning their lessons well, and even oppose efforts to study their lessons well as "individualism," which is very wrong and very harmful. If students do not study their lessons well, and Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in schools cannot set an example and play a model role in learning, then where will the new China obtain a continuous stream of excellent construction talents?
    "Students should focus on work, this is to obey the needs of the actual work at that time and place." - Some comrades put forward this opinion.
    "Guaranteeing the completion of students' learning tasks, and guaranteeing the normal progress and continuous development of school education, this is to obey the needs of our country's overall interests and long-term interests." - This is our answer.
    Criticizing and overcoming the view of underestimating learning, and fighting to improve the knowledge level of students nationwide, is one of the important tasks of the current student movement.
    However, some students use the excuse that learning is important, belittle politics, are unwilling to be involved in politics, and only want to bury themselves in books and become experts in the future. This so-called "expert thought" that is divorced from politics is wrong.
    What does it mean to be an "expert" who doesn't care about politics? That is to say, he wants to be an expert who does not care about the interests of the people and the country, but only cares about personal interests. Of course, our country does not need to train this kind of expert who is aloof from politics, because they can become good employees of any wealthy person, but they cannot become loyal servants of the people. The new China needs experts of the people who have both talent and virtue, who must not only be proficient in specialized knowledge and skills, but also have a high degree of political consciousness and new political qualities - placing the interests of the country rather than personal interests as the most important, and serving the people wholeheartedly.
    Some people believe that there is an insurmountable contradiction between "politics" and "learning": either grasp "politics" and be a person who serves the people wholeheartedly, or grasp "learning" and be a specialized talent who is proficient in technology - you cannot have both. This view that completely opposes "politics" and "learning" is also obviously wrong. Among students in various places, there are now some Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members who are not only very active in politics and work, but also very excellent in academic performance. This proves that "politics" and "learning" are not contradictory but can be unified. The problem lies only in how to correctly understand the relationship between the two and overcome one-sidedness. What needs to be particularly noted here is that the agencies responsible for leading or guiding the student movement in various places, on the one hand, must attach importance to students' patriotic ideological education, and at the same time, must cherish and guarantee students' study time, and do not casually increase students' unnecessary burden of extra work, hindering their learning.
    On the issue of learning, we should be realistic and oppose formalism. Because mastering knowledge requires dedicated and long-term research and one's own true understanding, and there can be no shortcuts. Marx said: "There is no royal road to learning, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits." (Preface to the First Volume of *Capital*) Some schools implement "learning competitions," emphasizing "collective learning," using the learning achievements of the whole class or group of students to compete with other classes or groups of students, and using the total average score of the whole class or group of students as each person's learning score. This learning method cannot cultivate students' correct realistic research spirit, hinders the full development of students in learning, and is formalistic and harmful. Factories need to implement "production competitions," but schools cannot implement "learning competitions," because schools educate talents, which is different from factories manufacturing products. A person's process of growth in thought and knowledge must gradually advance in an orderly manner. Haste makes waste.
    In addition, appropriately improving the relationship between teachers and students in schools is also an important factor in improving learning. Teachers impart knowledge to students and guide students to progress, so they should be respected by students. Close friendship and cooperation between teachers and students is necessary and beneficial for both students and teachers. However, teachers across the country have not been completely reformed, and many teachers are not ideologically and politically sufficient to gain the trust of students, and there are even some counter-revolutionary elements hidden in schools. If we now universally put forward a "respect teachers movement" without analysis, that is inappropriate. We should treat them separately according to the specific situation. We should respect and kindly assist all progressive teachers and teachers who are willing to make progress. For counter-revolutionary elements who are ideologically and politically hostile to the people, or those who are ideologically and politically very stubborn and backward, we should expose and criticize them from the bottom up.
    III. Carrying out Sports and Cultural Entertainment Activities in Schools and Improving Students' Health Conditions

    The body is the most important capital for us to engage in learning and any other revolutionary work. Without a strong physique, we cannot be competent in intense learning, nor can we shoulder heavy work, and become powerful builders of the new China. Therefore, actively carrying out sports and cultural entertainment activities in schools and improving students' health conditions should be listed as one of the important tasks of the current student movement.
    We should have a relatively complete understanding of health issues. We require students in the new China to be not only strong in body, but also lively and happy in spirit. Therefore, every student should not only actively participate in sports activities in schools and pay attention to exercising their body, but also actively participate in necessary cultural entertainment activities to enrich and improve their spiritual life. In addition, they should also pay attention to developing correct living habits that are in line with science, which is also a very important condition for maintaining their health.
    Sports and cultural entertainment activities in schools are an integral part of patriotic education. They should serve to improve students' health, and should also adapt to the situation and needs of the motherland. Now the economic situation of our entire country is still relatively difficult temporarily. Therefore, when carrying out sports and cultural entertainment activities, we need to pay attention to the principle of frugality and realistically promote various relatively simple and easy-to-implement sports activities and cultural entertainment activities based on the material conditions of the school.
    In order to adapt to the needs of national defense construction, military sports activities should be promoted when objective conditions and subjective forces permit.
    Some students believe that carrying out sports and cultural entertainment activities will hinder learning. This understanding is incorrect. For politically conscious students who know how to cherish themselves, appropriately participating in sports activities and cultural entertainment activities will never neglect their lessons as a result. On the contrary, it can make them more energetic and vigorous to carry out learning or work, and further improve the efficiency of learning and work.
    In some schools in remote areas, some students regard certain necessary hygiene habits, such as having their own washbasin or other hygiene products, as a manifestation of a corrupt life. This view is also wrong. Only excessive waste and unreasonable enjoyment of life should be criticized; as for necessary hygiene habits, they can ensure that you get sick less, and can avoid waste, which should be promoted and not opposed.
    IV. Strengthening the Work of Student Unions and the New Democratic Youth League in Schools

    Student unions and the Youth League are the two most basic forms of organization of student masses in schools today. Strengthening the work of student unions and the Youth League is a necessary condition for doing a good job in student work in schools.
    How should the work of student unions and the Youth League be divided?
    Student unions are organizations of all students, and the content of their work varies according to the different situations of each school. For example, the content of the work of student unions will not be exactly the same in schools in new areas and schools in old areas, universities and middle schools, public schools and private schools, church schools and non-church schools, schools with a better work foundation and schools with a poor work foundation. But there is one general and fundamental principle that must be followed: the work of student unions must face all students and must conform to the specific situation of their own schools and the requirements of the majority of students. The work related to the learning and life welfare of all students, sports and cultural entertainment, and other aspects related to all students should be led and carried out by the student unions. Therefore, student unions in schools are not only necessary to exist, but also need to play their important role.
    The Youth League organizations in schools carry out their work in accordance with the Youth League Program and Constitution of the New Democratic Youth League. Its main task is to develop and consolidate the Youth League organizations in schools, and to educate League members and ordinary students in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought through various practical activities and theoretical studies in schools.
    Student unions and the Youth League need to carry out their work in schools at the same time, and neither should be neglected.
    How should the work of student unions and the Youth League coordinate?
    On the one hand, through the democratic election procedures in the student union, the Youth League organization in the school sends outstanding League members who have won the trust of the majority of students to participate in the work of the student union to strengthen the leadership of the student union. For various calls from the student union, the Youth League organization mobilizes its League members and the broad masses of students to actively respond and strive to ensure the smooth implementation of various resolutions of the student union. The Youth League organization in the school should become the most active and powerful supporter of the student union.
    On the other hand, the student union, through its various activities, unites the broadest range of students with different interests, different beliefs, and different levels of awareness, so that they can be educated to varying degrees. The student union provides a place for the League members and ordinary students in the school to carry out common activities, creating the best conditions for the Youth League to contact the broad masses of students.
    In student work, the role of the student union should not be underestimated. The most outstanding Communist Party members and Youth League members in schools should actively participate in the work of the student union, ensure the quality of the leadership of the student union, so that the student union can fully play its role; at the same time, the leadership structure of the student union must include the necessary number of ordinary students other than Party members and League members, so that the student union can more widely contact the vast majority of students. In the election of the student union, if too many Party members and League members are elected, consideration should be given to allowing some Party members and League members to voluntarily resign, so that other students have the opportunity to participate in the leadership of the student union.
    At present, the leadership structure of the Youth League organization in schools is very unstable. Few Youth League secretaries have served a full year, and they are even transferred several times within a semester, which cannot but damage the work of the League to some extent. In the future, efforts should be made to make the leadership structure of the Youth League organization in schools more stable, in order to accumulate experience and improve the leadership level of the Youth League in schools.
    Communist Party members and Youth League members among students should be good at cooperating with ordinary students, and Communist Party members and Youth League members in church schools should be especially good at cooperating with ordinary religious students. Of course, cooperation needs to have a common ideological foundation, not unprincipled accommodation. This common ideological foundation is patriotism, which is the common program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that opposes imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Youth League members must adopt a humble and prudent attitude, and prevent arrogance and complacency and rigid working methods. It is hoped that ordinary students in various schools can also put forward positive suggestions and kind criticisms to the Youth League organization and Youth League members, to help the Youth League organization and Youth League members overcome shortcomings and improve their work.
    Finally, a few words should be said about the work of the All-China Students' Federation.
    The work of the All-China Students' Federation must be adapted to the basic tasks of the student movement. Before liberation, the main task of the All-China Students' Federation was to lead students to carry out political struggles against imperialism and domestic reactionary rulers. Now, the main task of the All-China Students' Federation is to inspire the patriotic thoughts of students, strengthen students' learning, consolidate students' unity, support the leadership of the Communist Party, and respond to all calls of the People's Government. The specific work of student federations at all levels should mainly be to exchange experiences in learning and work among students in various aspects through various appropriate methods; and to solve problems related to the life and welfare of the majority of students according to possible conditions. In China's current situation, on the one hand, the organization of the student federation still has a great role to play, and we still need to appropriately strengthen its work; but on the other hand, the student federation should not have a very large organizational structure, nor should it shoulder too much regular work. Because today, under the leadership of the revolutionary government, students should focus on on-campus activities and minimize unnecessary off-campus activities, so that they can better complete their learning tasks and better serve the new China in the future.

    目前学生运动中的几个问题
    ——在中华全国学生第十五届代表大会上的报告
    蒋南翔
    自从一九四九年三月召开中华全国学生第十四届代表大会以来，已经两年有余。在这两年中，我们国家在各方面有了空前的进步；我国学生运动，也同样有很大成绩。现在我就目前学生运动所应着重注意的几个问题，讲一些意见。一、在全国学生中普及和加深
    爱国主义的思想教育
    自五四运动以来，中国学生运动一直保持着光荣的爱国传统。中国人民革命取得胜利以后，在中国共产党和人民政府底领导和教育下，中国学生底爱国主义精神，有了更进一步的发展。
    中国学生底高度爱国主义精神，表现在解放初期欢迎和协助人民解放军底进军；参加初解放城市底接管工作；进行热烈的思想改造运动；积极参加抗美援朝运动；拥护土地改革和镇压反革命；教会学校学生热烈拥护人民政府接管教会学校的措施；大学毕业生服从政府统一分配工作；全国学生两次响应人民政府号召，踊跃参加军事干部学校；等等。全国学生通过以上各种实际行动所表现出来的那种爱国精神和觉悟程度，是旧时代底学生所不曾有过的。
    但是我们不能满足于已有的成绩。爱国主义的思想教育还不能说是已经完全普遍了，更不能说是充分地深入了。现在美帝国主义正在采取各种卑鄙无耻的办法企图来危害我们底国家。全国抗美援朝运动正在热烈地进行，为了祖国底需要，我们必须在全国同学中，更加普及和加深爱国主义的思想教育。
    这就是说，我们还要有计划地逐步推广爱国主义的思想教育，使全国每一学校底每一学生，都受到爱国主义的思想洗礼，还要提高爱国主义教育底思想内容，使爱国主义精神建筑在巩固的马列主义和毛泽东思想的基础之上，能够更深刻地启发广大学生的觉悟，更有力地把我国学生运动推向前进。
    新中国伟大胜利的影响，已经传播到地球上最遥远的地方，鼓舞了全世界亿万人民底胜利信心。但在我们自己国内，却还有极少数学生对于伟大祖国底伟大成就，熟视无睹，没有什么感觉。他们还保留着旧中国时代的思想面貌，以漠不关心的态度甚至以抱有某种成见的态度，来对待新中国底各种伟大的变革和创造。我们必须以爱国主义的思想光辉去照亮学校中底这些最后的黑暗角落，使新中国底每一个学生，都不愧为毛泽东时代的青年，不辜负人民底期望和国家底培养，成为伟大祖国底英勇保卫者和积极建设者。
    我们应当在教会学校及教徒同学中，热诚地去进行推广爱国主义的思想教育工作。在新中国，中国人民有宗教信仰的自由，但不能允许帝国主义分子利用宗教信仰来损害我们祖国底利益。信奉宗教的同学，他们和全国其他同学同样生息在祖国底土地上，受着国家底保护和教养，他们有义务爱护自己伟大的祖国和祖国勤劳勇敢的人民！一个正直的具有宗教信仰的学生，他应当首先是一个爱国者，然后才是一个宗教徒。在抗美援朝运动中，曾有若干教徒同学踊跃参加军事干部学校，坚决走上国防建设的岗位，他们这种爱国行动，是教徒同学底光辉的榜样。
    我们应当在全国同学中，加强马列主义和毛泽东思想的宣传。有些同学口头上是爱国的，但经不起实际行动的考验。他们在土地改革和镇压反革命的运动中表现立场不坚定；人民政府号召参加军事干部学校的时候表示动摇畏缩；对于毕业后服从政府分配工作表示某些保留态度甚至抗拒态度；分不清敌友，缺乏国际主义精神；不关心政治，只想自己当专家；等等。所有这一切缺点，实质上来自一个根源，就是以个人利益而不是以祖国和人民底利益作为考虑问题的出发点。只有无产阶级的集体主义，只有马列主义和毛泽东思想，才能战胜我们头脑中底各种不正确的旧思想、旧习惯。所以，要成为澈底的爱国者，必须以马列主义和毛泽东思想武装自己。
    普及和加深爱国主义的思想教育，必须使全国同学在思想上弄明确两个最根本的问题：第一、要划清革命与反革命的界限；第二、要认识工人阶级思想与非工人阶级思想的区别。
    为什么要划清革命与反革命的界限？因为我们必须首先分清谁是敌人，谁是朋友。对于朋友，我们是采取坚定的团结方针。对于人民底敌人——帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，我们就要进行坚决的不调和的斗争。我们不但要严厉批驳危害人民的各种反动宣传，努力肃清学生思想中底封建的、买办的、法西斯的残余影响，而且要负责检举隐藏在学校当中进行反革命活动的破坏分子，把他们清除出学校。人民的学校，是要培养新中国底建设人才，不能允许反革命分子存在，成为害群之马。当然，我们要清洗的对象，仅仅是学生中底败类，极少数不可救药的极端堕落的分子。对于一般思想上比较落后的同学，仍应以教育和改造为原则。
    “划清革命与反革命的界限”，就是要正确解决我国学生运动中底团结问题。人民革命胜利了的新中国，有必要也有可能尽量推广学生运动的规模，使我国学生运动成为推动全体学生而不仅仅是推动部分学生走向进步的因素，这就必须在爱国主义的思想基础上，在人民政协共同纲领的基础上，一方面建立全国同学底最广泛的团结，另一方面准确而且有力地孤立和打击隐藏在学生队伍中底反革命分子。这就是说，全国同学用以划分自己敌友的界限的，应当仅仅是革命与反革命之间的斗争，绝不是任何其他方面的差别。
    有些人们，不是很明确地强调革命与反革命的界限，而是自觉或不自觉地强调了其他方面的界限，例如强调了学生中党、团员和非党、团员的界限，教徒与非教徒的界限，因而使党员、团员和一般同学之间，教徒同学和非教徒同学之间，不能建立应有的良好合作关系。在某些土地改革地区，又有不加分析地排斥学校中底非工农家庭出身的学生的现象，这是重复过去多次发生过的错误。这些现象都应当纠正。
    只有首先划清革命与反革命的界限，我们才能正确而且广泛地将全国同学团结在爱国主义的旗帜下，一同前进。
    为什么要认识工人阶级思想与非工人阶级思想的区别？因为人民民主专政的新中国，存在着不同的阶级和代表不同阶级利益的不同的思想，全国同学必须认识什么思想是完全正确的，需要好好学习；什么思想是不正确或不完全正确的，应当批判和提高。中国现在实行新民主主义建设，将来还要走向社会主义和共产主义；新中国底学生不但要成为新民主主义社会底建设者，而且还应成为社会主义社会和共产主义社会底建设者。因此，历史已经向全国同学提出了庄严的要求，要求全国同学不但都要有热烈的爱国心，而且还应努力学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，努力使自己具有高度的共产主义的觉悟水平，以适应新中国今天和明天的建设需要。
    “认识工人阶级思想与非工人阶级思想的区别”，就是要正确解决我国学生运动中底领导问题。全国学生，应以工人阶级的思想而不是以任何其他的思想，作为指导自己学习和工作的最高准绳。新中国是在马列主义和毛泽东思想的领导之下胜利前进，新中国底学生运动，也应当而且必须在马列主义和毛泽东思想的领导之下，胜利前进。
    马列主义和毛泽东思想，是我们革命行动的指南，同时也是我们研究各种科学的指南。真正的科学，是人类对于自然的或社会的客观规律底一定范围和一定程度的总结，我们学习了马列主义和毛泽东思想，掌握了辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，就能使我们获得正确解剖自然界的和人类社会的各种复杂现象的最锐利的思想武器，从而为我们底一切科学研究开辟最宽广的发展道路。马列主义和毛泽东思想，已在我国伟大的革命运动当中显示了无敌的力量，毫无疑义，它还必须发展到各种科学领域中去，为我们底科学研究工作创造伟大的胜利。
    但是必须指出：澈底领会马列主义和毛泽东思想，是要经历长时期的学习和实践的过程，决不是
    一年半载也不是三年五载就能完全达到目的的。全国学生必须重视马列主义和毛泽东思想的学习，这是一方面；必须承认学习的长期性，不能操之过急，这是又一方面。如果要求全国学生在很短时期内就完全掌握马列主义和毛泽东思想，并且要求在很短时期内就完全肃清全国同学中底各种非无产阶级思想，那是不可能的，因而也是不适当的。不管客观实际情况而要勉强这样做，就会出毛病，产生偏向。解放以后全国各地曾有不少大学实行不适当的“思想总结”，就是希望以短促突击的方式来“澈底打垮学校中的非无产阶级思想”，这种急躁的和粗暴的做法证明是不切实际的，错误的，今后不应当重复这一类错误。二、努力提高全国学生底知识
    水平
    作为新中国底建设者，不但要有热爱祖国的思想，并且要有丰富的知识。全国同学，应在爱国主义的思想基础上，努力提高自己底知识水平。
    在反动统治的时代，在革命的学生运动中，不能提出“提高学生底知识水平”的口号。在旧的统治时代底旧的学校中，提出这种口号，实际上只能是学生主要斗争目标底转移。在革命胜利了的新中国，“提高学生底知识水平”，就有了极重要的现实意义。
    新社会要澈底战胜旧社会，永远地保持胜利，必须使新社会具有远远超过旧社会的经济水平和文化水平。因此，我们要求新中国底工人发挥劳动上的积极性和创造性，拥有远较旧中国时代为高的劳动生产率，保证生产力的迅速发展。也要求新中国底学生发挥学习上的积极性和创造性，使新中国底学生具有比旧中国底学生更高的知识水平，以适应新中国伟大建设事业的需要。努力学好建设新中国的有用的知识，这就是我国学生底爱国主义的具体表现。
    提高学生底知识水平，当然需要依靠政府教育部门的领导和教师的具体指导，例如稳定学校底学习秩序，适当地改革学制课程，编辑审定正确的教科书，调整学校的院系，提高师资，改进教学方法，适当规定学生底作息时间等等，这些都是提高学校教育效果所必须解决的问题。这一方面，人民政府是在努力进行工作，并且收到了成效；但必须经历更长的改革和改进的过程，才能把以上一系列问题完全加以澈底解决。
    另外，提高学生底知识水平，还必须依靠学生本身的努力。从学生方面来说，这是自己随时可以做得到的，因而也是更重要的一方面。如果自己努力，即使其他方面的学习条件较差，也能获得较多知识。如果自己不努力，即使学习条件好，也不会学得好。
    有些地方有些学校，对学生不是强调学习而是强调工作，认为“工作第一、学习第二”，公开号召学生要把百分之七十的精力做好校外的“党政中心工作”，甚至把学生当做“机动干部”，随时调用。——这种观点和这种作法，是不对的。显然用不到证明：学校是有系统地传授学生知识的地方，不是工作队；学生是为了要学习将来能为国家服务的知识而来学校，不是现职的供给制或薪金制的工作人员。除了在解放初期那种很特殊的情况下，需要而且应当吸收学生参加较多的课外活动或校外工作而外，我们不应忘记“学生底基本任务在于学习”，正像我们不应忘记“工人底基本任务在于生产”。在某些学校中，有些同学，特别是有些共产党员、青年团员，他们竟否认学生有学好功课之必要，甚至把努力学习功课目为“个人主义”而加以反对，这是很错误、很有害的。学生不学好功课，学校中底共产党员、青年团员不能以身作则，在学习上面起模范作用，那么新中国将从哪里去获得源源不断的大量优秀的建设人才？
    “学生应以工作为主，这是服从当时当地实际工作底需要。”——有些同志这样提出意见。
    “保证学生学习任务的完成，保证学校教育的正常进行和不断发展，这是服从我们国家整体利益和长远利益底需要。”——这是我们底回答。
    批判和克服轻视学习的观点，为提高全国学生底知识水平而斗争，这是当前学生运动底重要任务之一。
    但是有些学生藉口学习重要，轻视政治，不愿过问政治，只想自己埋头读书，将来当专家，这种脱离政治的所谓“专家思想”，却是错误的。
    做一个不问政治的“专家”是什么意思？那就是说，他要做一个不关心人民和国家利益，而只关心个人利益的专家。我们国家当然不需要培养这种超然于政治之外的专家，因为他们可以成为任何有钱人底良好的雇员，但不能成为人民底忠实的勤务员。新中国所需要的是才德兼备的人民的专家，他们不但必须精通专门的知识技能，而且必须具有高度的政治觉悟和新的政治品质——以国家底利益而不是以个人底利益为重，全心全意为人民服务。
    有人认为“政治”和“学习”存在着不可克服的矛盾：或者是抓紧“政治”，做个全心全意为人民服务的人。或者是抓紧“学习”，做个精通技术的专门人才。——两者不可得兼。这种把“政治”和“学习”完全对立起来的观点也显然是错误的。在各地同学之中，现在都可找到这样一些共产党员和青年团员，他们不但在政治上、工作上是很积极的，并且在学业成绩方面也是很优秀的。这就证明，“政治”和“学习”不是矛盾而是可以统一的。问题仅仅在于如何正确地理解这两者的相互关系，克服片面性。这里需要特别提起注意的，就是各地对学生运动负有领导或指导责任的机关，一方面要重视学生底爱国主义的思想教育，同时又要爱惜并保证学生底学习时间，不要随便增加学生不必要的额外工作的负担，妨碍他们底学习。
    在学习问题上，应当实事求是，反对形式主义。因为掌握知识，需要专心致志的长期钻研和自己真正的领会，决不能有什么捷径。马克思说：“在科学上面是没有平坦的大路可走的，只有那在攀登上不畏劳苦、不畏险阻的人，才有希望攀到光辉的顶点。”（资本论第一卷序言）有些学校实行“学习竞赛”，强调“集体学习”，以全班或全组同学底学习成绩去跟别班别组同学比赛，以全班或全组同学底总平均分数作为每人底学习分数。这种学习方式，不能培养同学正确的实事求是的研究精神，妨碍同学在学习上的充分发展，是形式主义的和有害的。工厂中需要实行“生产竞赛”，但学校中不能实行“学习竞赛”，因为学校教育人才，不同于工厂制造生产品。一个人在思想上和知识上的成长过程，必须逐渐地循序前进，欲速则不达。
    另外，适当地改进学校中底师生关系，也是改进学习的一个重要因素。教师传授学生知识，引导学生进步，所以是应当受到同学底尊敬的。密切师生间的友谊合作，对学生对教师都是必要和有益的。但是现在全国教师还没有完全经过改造，还有许多教师在思想上政治上都不足以取得同学底信赖，甚至还有一些反革命分子隐藏在学校当中。如果现在就不加分析地普遍地提出“尊师运动”，那是不适当的。我们应当根据具体情况，分别对待。对于所有进步的教师和愿意进步的教师，应当尊敬和善意地协助他们。对于思想上政治上敌视人民的反革命分子，或是思想上政治上非常顽固落后的分子，应当自下而上地给以揭露和批判。三、开展学校中底体育和文化
    娱乐活动，改进学生底
    健康状况
    身体是我们从事学习和任何其他革命工作最重要的资本，如果没有强健的体魄，我们就不能胜任紧张的学习，也不能担负繁重的工作，成为新中国底有力建设者。因此，积极开展学校中底体育和文化娱乐活动，改进学生底健康状况，应当列为现在学生运动底重要任务之一。
    对于健康问题，我们应有比较完全的了解。我们要求新中国底学生，不但在身体方面是强健的，并且在精神方面也是活泼愉快的。因此，每个同学不但应当积极参加学校中底体育活动，注意锻炼自己底身体，而且要积极参加必要的文化娱乐活动，丰富和提高自己底精神生活。此外并应注意养成合乎科学的正确的生活习惯，这也是保持自己健康很为重要的条件。
    学校中底体育及文化娱乐活动，是爱国主义教育底一个组成部分，它要为改进学生底健康服务，同时还应适应祖国底情况和需要。现在我们整个国家底经济状况，暂时还是比较困难的，因此在开展体育和文化娱乐活动的时候，需要注意节约的原则，现实地根据学校底物资条件，首先推行各种比较简单易行的体育活动和文化娱乐活动。
    为了适应国防建设的需要，在客观条件和主观力量许可的情况下，应当注意提倡军事体育方面的活动。
    有些同学认为开展体育和文化娱乐活动，会妨碍学习，这种了解是不正确的。对于有政治觉悟的知道自爱的同学，适当地参加体育活动和文化娱乐活动，决不会因而荒废他们底功课，相反，可以使他们更加精神饱满、生气勃勃地去进行学习或工作，更加提高学习和工作底效率。
    在某些偏僻地方的学校中，有些同学把某些必要的清洁卫生习惯，例如自己有一个脸盆或其他某些卫生用品，也视为生活腐化的表现，这种看法也是不对的。只有过度的浪费和不合理的生活享受，才应当批评；至于必要的清洁卫生习惯，可以保证自己少生疾病，正可避免浪费，这是应当提倡而不应当反对的。四、加强学校中学生会底工作
    和新民主主义青年团底
    工作
    学生会和青年团是现在学校中学生群众最基本的两种组织形式。加强学生会底工作和青年团底工作，是作好学校中学生工作底必要条件。
    学生会底工作和青年团底工作如何分工？
    学生会是全体学生底组织，它底工作内容根据各学校不同的情况而不同。例如新区的学校和老区的学校，大学和中学，公立学校和私立学校，教会学校和非教会学校，工作基础较好的学校和工作基础较差的学校，学生会底工作内容不会是完全一样的。但有一个总的根本原则必须遵守：学生会底工作必须面向全体同学，必须符合于自己学校底具体情况及大多数同学底要求。有关全体同学底学习和生活福利方面的工作，体育和文化娱乐方面的工作，以及其他有关全体同学方面的工作，都应当由学生会来领导进行。因此，学校中底学生会是不但有必要存在，而且需要发挥它底重要的作用。
    学校中底青年团组织，是根据新民主主义青年团底团纲团章进行工作，它底主要任务是发展和巩固学校中底青年团组织，通过学校中底各种实际活动和理论学习，向团员及一般同学进行马列主义和毛泽东思想的教育。
    学生会和青年团，需要在学校中同时进行工作，不能偏废。
    学生会底工作和青年团底工作如何配合？
    一方面，通过学生会中民主选举的手续，学校中青年团底组织派遣自己取得多数同学信任的优秀团员参加学生会底工作，加强学生会底领导。对于学生会底各种号召，青年团底组织动员自己底团员和广大同学积极响应，努力保证学生会各种决议的顺利执行。学校中底青年团组织，应成为学生会最积极有力的支持者。
    另一方面，学生会通过自己底各种活动，最广泛地团结了各种不同兴趣、不同信仰、不同觉悟程度的全体同学，使他们在各种不同的程度上接受教育。学生会使学校中底青年团员和一般同学获得一个共同活动的场所，为青年团创造了联系广大同学的最良好的条件。
    在学生工作中，不应对学生会底作用估计不足。学校中最优秀的共产党员和青年团员，应该积极参加学生会底工作，保证学生会底领导质量，使学生会能够充分发挥作用；同时在学生会底领导机构中，又必须尽量包括必要数量的党员、团员以外的一般同学，以便学生会能够更广泛地联系绝大多数同学。在学生会底选举中，如果当选的党员、团员过多，应该考虑让某些党员、团员自动提出辞职，以便使其他同学有机会参加学生会的领导。
    现在学校中青年团组织底领导机构，很不稳定，青年团底书记，任期满一年者很少，甚至在一个学期之内调动几次，这样就不能不在某种程度上损害了团底工作。今后应努力使学校中青年团组织底领导机构比较稳定一些，以便积累经验，提高学校中青年团底领导水平。
    学生中的共产党员、青年团员应善于和一般同学合作，教会学校中底共产党员、青年团员特别要善于和一般教徒同学合作。当然，合作需要有一个共同的思想基础，不是无原则的迁就，这个共同的思想基础就是爱国主义，就是反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领。青年团员必须采取谦虚谨慎态度，防止骄傲自满情绪和生硬的工作方式。希望各学校的一般同学也能对青年团组织和青年团员提出积极的建议和善意的批评，帮助青年团底组织和青年团员克服缺点，改进工作。
    最后关于我国学生联合会底工作，应当说明几句。
    学生联合会底工作，必须和学生运动底基本任务相适应。在解放以前，我国学生联合会底主要工作，是领导广大学生进行反对帝国主义和本国反动统治者的政治斗争。在现在，我国学生联合会底主要任务，就在于启发广大同学底爱国思想，加强同学底学习，巩固同学底团结，拥护共产党底领导，响应人民政府底一切号召。各级学生联合会底具体工作，主要应当是通过各种适当的方式，交流各方面同学底学习和工作的经验；根据可能的条件，解决有关多数同学的生活福利问题。在我国目前的情况下，一方面是学生联合会底组织还有很大作用，我们还需要适当地加强它的工作；但是另一方面，学生联合会又不宜于有很庞大的组织机构，也不必负担过多的经常工作。因为今天在革命政府领导下，学生应当以校内活动为主，尽量减少不必要的校外活动，以便自己能够更好地完成学习任务，在将来更好地为新中国服务。
