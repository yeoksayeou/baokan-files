The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's transformation from poverty to wealth through eight years of collective labor is a living example. It makes the broad masses of farmers realize that only by organizing production after land reform can they become prosperous, and only by studying politics can they broaden their horizons and see a bright future, thus consolidating and developing mutual aid teams. Farmers in Pingshun County are using the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team as a banner, and over 80% have organized themselves. Currently, over 1,600 mutual aid teams in Pingshun County are participating in patriotic production increase competitions. Like the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, 1,200 mutual aid teams have relatively sound democratic practices within the team, established a work-point exchange system and a study system (including political current affairs study and cultural study), and are paying attention to improving agricultural technology and managing sideline production.

The Pingshun County People's Government and the CPC County Committee regularly use the experience of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team to promote the mutual aid movement in Pingshun County. For example, last spring, many mutual aid teams in Pingshun County experienced disintegration because production had recovered, and the labor force and livestock had increased, so the general farmers were not very interested in mutual aid. That is to say, the cadres neglected the ideological education of the farmers, and the farmers did not recognize the correct direction for future production development and the great significance of organizing themselves; the cadres also did not pay attention to enriching the mutual aid teams with new content. At this time, in order to improve the mutual aid movement a step further, the Pingshun County People's Government and the CPC Pingshun County Committee sent capable cadres to summarize the achievements and experiences of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team; then convened county and district cadre meetings, party member representative meetings, mutual aid team representative meetings, labor model meetings, and other meetings to spread these achievements and experiences, and used lantern slides, comic strips, storytelling, and other forms to publicize them to the farmers of the entire county. Later, they also organized farmers from various places to visit the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team; lectured on the development direction of rural production in various village schools, and mobilized farmers to recall their new and old lives, compare the advantages and disadvantages of mutual aid and individual farming, etc. In this way, the farmers gradually realized the correct path of "collective labor leads to prosperity" from the facts of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team and their own experience. At the same time, the CPC Pingshun County Committee also held training sessions for party members, rectified rural branches, and conducted socialist future education for rural party members. On the basis of the above ideological education, the county's mutual aid teams underwent a rectification last year; some mutual aid team members' selfish ideas and conservative thoughts were changed, and some mutual aid teams established democratic life systems and study systems like the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team.

In the movement of Pingshun County farmers learning from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, there is also an important issue, which is to learn from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's continuous research on farming techniques and improvement of agricultural production, learn from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's use of new agricultural tools, and learn from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's management of sideline production with the help of the village supply and marketing cooperative. This has opened up a broad prospect for the development of labor mutual aid, so that farmers realize that mutual aid is not just to solve the difficulties of labor and livestock, but more importantly to develop production. The Pingshun farmers saw that the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team used new plows and new harrows to plow deeply and harrow evenly, and they were very envious, so they also collectively bought new agricultural tools through the mutual aid team. As a result, the mutual aid organization was consolidated on a new basis. Currently, 110 mutual aid teams in Pingshun County are collectively using new agricultural tools.

This spring, when the Resist America, Aid Korea movement unfolded in the rural areas of Shanxi, the Shanxi Daily published an editorial entitled "Li Shunda is both a Labor Model and a Patriotic Model." The farmers in various villages universally studied this editorial, which also greatly promoted the mutual aid movement. After the farmers realized the consistency of patriotism and wealth creation, their enthusiasm for developing production was even higher, and more people participated in the mutual aid teams. This spring, the male labor force participating in mutual aid teams in Pingshun County reached 83%, while the statistics last spring showed only 60%.

This year, after the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team initiated the patriotic production increase competition, more than 500 better mutual aid teams in Pingshun County responded to the challenge. Therefore, the movement to learn from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team has been carried out more widely in Pingshun. In order to enable other mutual aid teams to better learn from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, the Pingshun County leading organs have paid more attention to using the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team as an example to cultivate model mutual aid teams in various districts and villages this year. Currently, Pingshun has cultivated 151 model teams, distributed throughout the county. Among them, the Yang Fengshan Mutual Aid Team in Jiebankou, the Guo Yu'en Mutual Aid Team in Chuandi Village, and the Guo Bingfu Mutual Aid Team in Lujiakou Village are all well-known in the county. Every production season, the Pingshun County leading organs use these model teams as the center to organize competitions and summarize and evaluate work, and pay attention to spreading the new creations and new experiences of these new model mutual aid teams at any time.

    平顺县怎样推广李顺达互助组的先进经验
    新华社记者  马明
    李顺达互助组八年来集体劳动由贫变富是一个活的榜样，它使广大农民认识：土地改革以后只有组织起来生产才能富裕，只有学习政治才能开阔眼界，看到美满的远景，使互助组巩固发展。平顺县的农民以李顺达互助组为旗帜，百分之八十以上都组织起来了。现在，平顺全县有一千六百多个互助组参加了爱国丰产竞赛，一千二百个互助组和李顺达互助组一样，在组内有比较健全的民主生活，建立有计工换工的制度和学习制度（包括政治时事学习和文化学习），并注意改进农业技术和经营副业生产。
    平顺县人民政府和中共县委员会经常用李顺达互助组的经验来推动平顺县的互助运动。例如去年春天，平顺县许多互助组发生涣散现象，原因是生产恢复了，劳动力和畜力增加了，一般农民对互助的兴趣就不高了。这就是说，干部忽视了对农民的思想教育工作，农民不认识今后发展生产的正确方向和组织起来的重大意义；干部也没有注意为互助组充实新的内容。这时候，为了把互助运动提高一步，平顺县人民政府及中共平顺县委员会曾派得力干部去总结了李顺达互助组的成绩和经验；随即召开县、区干部会、党员代表会、互助组代表会、劳动模范会等会议来传播这些成绩和经验，并运用幻灯、连环画、说鼓书等形式向全县农民宣传。以后，又曾组织各地农民去参观李顺达互助组；在各村民校中讲农村生产的发展方向，并发动农民回忆新旧生活，比较互助和单干的优劣等。这样，农民就从李顺达互助组的事实和自身的经验中，逐渐认识了“集体劳动由贫变富”的正确道路。同时，中共平顺县委员会又集训党员，整顿农村支部，对农村党员进行了社会主义的前途教育。在以上思想教育的基础上，去年全县的互助组进行了一番整顿工作；一些互助组员的自私观念和保守思想得到改变，有一些互助组并照李顺达互助组的样子，建立了民主生活制度和学习制度。
    在平顺县农民学习李顺达互助组的运动中，还有一个重要问题，就是学习李顺达互助组的不断研究农作技术和提高农业生产，学习李顺达互助组使用新式农具，学习李顺达互助组在村供销合作社帮助下经营副业生产。这样就为劳动互助开辟了一个广阔的发展前途，使农民认识互助起来不只是可以解决劳动力牲口的困难，更重要的是为了发展生产。平顺农民看见李顺达互助组用新犁新耙耕得深耙得平，非常羡慕，于是他们也由互助组集体买新农具。这样一来互助组织便得以在一个新的基础上巩固起来了。现在，平顺全县已有一百一十个互助组集体使用新农具。
    今年春天，抗美援朝运动在山西农村展开时，山西日报发表了一篇题为“李顺达是劳动模范又是爱国模范”的社论。各村农民普遍学习这篇社论，这对互助运动也起了极大的推动作用。农民认识爱国和发家的一致性以后，发展生产的热情更高，参加互助组的更多。平顺全县今年春天参加互助组的男劳动力已达百分之八十三，而去年春天统计只有百分之六十。
    今年，李顺达互助组发起爱国丰产竞赛后，平顺县有五百多个较好的互助组应战。因此，学习李顺达互助组的运动在平顺开展得更加广泛。为了使其他互助组更好地学习李顺达互助组，平顺县领导机关今年更注意以李顺达互助组为榜样，在各区各村培养模范互助组。现在，平顺已培养出模范组一百五十一个，遍布全县。其中界畔峧杨峰山互助组、川底村的郭玉恩互助组、路家口村的郭丙福互助组都是全县知名的。每一生产季节，平顺县领导机关都要以这些模范组为中心，组织竞赛以及总结和评比工作，并注意随时传播这些新的模范互助组的新创造和新经验。
