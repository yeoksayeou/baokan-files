Joye's Reply of the Eleventh
To General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation:

    The Commander of the United Nations Forces reports that the Chief Delegate of the United Nations Forces stated: At approximately 1:30 AM on the morning of September 10th, radar detected an aircraft over Kaesong. Radar tracking of the aircraft's course, along with standard identification procedures, indicated that the aircraft was a United Nations Forces aircraft. Subsequent questioning of the pilot revealed that at approximately 1:35 AM, he strafed targets that he incorrectly identified due to navigational deficiencies. Based on this information and the investigation conducted by the United Nations Forces Liaison Officer on September 10th, the fact that a United Nations Forces aircraft strafed the Kaesong Neutral Zone on September 10th is accepted. The United Nations Forces Command expresses regret for this violation of the agreed-upon neutralization, which was caused by the pilot's navigational error. Appropriate disciplinary action is underway. We note that the Liaison Officer's investigation confirmed that this attack did not cause any damage.
        Chief Delegate of the United Nations Forces Delegation, Joye
        September 11, 1951

    乔埃十一日的复信朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军：
    联合国军司令官报告联合国军首席代表称：约在九月十日晨一时三十分雷达侦得开城区中有一飞机，对于该机航程的雷达追踪，加上通常辨识的程序，显示出这架飞机是联合国军的一架飞机。其后对于驾驶员的询问，显示他曾在约一时三十五分时，对于一些由于航行中的缺点，而为他不正确地辨识的目标，进行过扫射攻击。基于这一情报和联合国军联络官在九月十日所作的调查，兹接受一架联合国军飞机曾于九月十日在开城中立区内扫射的事实。联合国军司令部对于这一由于驾驶员航行中的错误所造成的对于协议了的中立化的违反，表示遗憾。适当的纪律行动正开始中。我方注意到联络官的调查证实这一攻击并未造成任何损失。
        联合国军代表团首席代表  乔埃
        一九五一年九月十一日
