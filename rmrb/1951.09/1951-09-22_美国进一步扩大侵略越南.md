Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: U.S. imperialism is intensifying its intervention in Vietnam. Recently, the commander-in-chief of the French invading forces in Vietnam, de Lattre de Tassigny, the head of the U.S. military mission in Saigon, Brink, the head of the U.S. economic advisory group in Saigon, Blum, and the U.S. minister to Saigon, Heath, all gathered in Washington to discuss the issue of aggression against Vietnam.

On September 14, Tassigny held a 25-minute meeting with Truman, and then visited U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett, and "studied in detail the situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia" with experts from the U.S. State Department, as well as "a detailed bill of the equipment and materials needed by the French army and the Vietnamese army (i.e., the Bảo Đại puppet army)." Tassigny told reporters at the Pentagon on September 18 that what he wanted to beg from the United States was, first and foremost, equipment for the four puppet army divisions that were being established, as well as the other four divisions that were planned.

According to Agence France-Presse, the White House and the Pentagon both told Tassigny that the United States believes that "the French army's war in Indochina is the same as the American war in Korea." Tassigny and his assistants' opinions were met with "lasting listening and full acceptance" from the American side. The United States will soon "take concrete decisions."

The United States' agreement to equip the Bảo Đại puppet army and other measures indicate that the United States is further expanding its aggression against Vietnam. According to the Electrical Communication Agency: after the San Francisco Conference, the U.S. government signed bilateral economic treaties with the three puppet regimes of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in early September. This is another proof that the United States is trying to directly control this region.

    美国进一步扩大侵略越南
    【新华社二十一日讯】美帝国主义正加紧对越南的干涉。最近，侵越法军总司令塔西尼、美国驻西贡军事使团团长白林克、美国驻西贡经济顾问团团长布拉姆及美国驻西贡公使海斯都聚集在华盛顿，商讨侵略越南的问题。
    塔西尼在九月十四日和杜鲁门作了二十五分钟的会谈，以后又访问了美国国防部长罗维特，并和美国国务院的专家们“详细地研究了印度支那及东南亚的情况”以及“法军和越南军（即保大伪军）需要装配物资的详细的账单”。塔西尼九月十八日在五角大楼招待记者时说，他所要乞求美国的，首先是装备正在建立中的四个伪军师以及在计划中的另外四个师。
    据法新社透露，白宫和五角大楼都向塔西尼表示：美国认为“法军在印度支那的战争和美国在朝鲜的战争是一样的”。塔西尼及其助手的意见，受到美国方面“持久的倾听和完全同意的接受”。美国不久将“采取具体的决定”。
    美国同意装备保大伪军以及其他的措施，表明美国正进一步扩大它对越南的侵略。据电通社消息：美国政府在旧金山会议以后，已在九月上旬先后和越南、老挝及柬埔寨的三个傀儡政权签订了双边经济条约。这是美国力图直接控制这一地区的另一证明。
