Shanxin Wharf is one of the sixteen water and land wharves in Changsha, located along the Xiang River. The tranquil Xiang River and its numerous tributaries connect Changsha with the vast countryside. In recent years, Hunan has enjoyed bumper harvests and smooth flow of goods, making Changsha more prosperous day by day. The bustling Shanxin Wharf is a mirror reflecting the economic prosperity of both urban and rural areas. Here, from morning till night, a large amount of goods are gathered and distributed, people come and go amidst the songs of labor, and countless ships line up along the riverbank. On the wharf, cotton, bricks, tiles, grain, foreign yarn, native paper, and egg products are piled up like undulating hills.

Before liberation, rural areas went bankrupt, urban and rural areas were blocked, and American goods were dumped. Only a few restaurants, cosmetics shops, and casinos catering to Kuomintang bureaucrats were thriving in Changsha, while other industries were on the verge of collapse. Shanxin Wharf was then a desolate, poor, dirty, quarrelsome place controlled by feudal guilds. Only one ship came to the river every day and a half. In spring, weeds grew on both sides of the wharf. Zhou Binxiang, a wharf worker, sighed, "How could we not be poor then?! It was hard enough to get a business, but we were still exploited by feudal foremen. Counterfeit banknotes were worthless, and no one could even afford to feed themselves."

After liberation, the People's Government led the people to create a new life. Shanxin Wharf began to change from April and May of last year. In the second half of last year, Hunan farmers achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in more than a decade. Boatloads of grain poured into Changsha from small rivers and ports in all directions, amounting to twenty to thirty thousand dan at a time. The volume of goods picked up and unloaded by urban industry and commerce gradually increased. The dockworkers were busy. Now, it’s not that people don’t have goods to transport, but that the goods can't be transported fast enough. Worker Liu Huigeng said, "So many goods are the result of the People's Government leading us to develop production over the past two years."

Indeed, in the past two years, the economy of urban and rural Hunan has undergone earth-shaking changes. This year, the province's total output of industry, agriculture, forestry, and handicrafts increased by 35% compared to before liberation. Due to the smooth flow of urban and rural exchanges, 90% of the province's total production of 11.8 billion jin of rice and native products has been sold. People in the Dongting Lake plain, a famous rice-producing area, said, "In these two years, rice grows even in the footprints of cattle." The Yuxiang Yarn Factory across the river from Shanxin Wharf needs more than twice as many porters this year as it did the year before last to transport all of its daily products. The number of industrial and commercial households in the city was only more than 5,700 at the time of liberation, but now it has increased to more than 15,000. In the first half of this year alone, the quantity of goods purchased by private merchants from other places increased by 273.6% compared to the second half of last year. The streets are crowded with people buying and selling goods. The dockworkers are also getting busier. The volume of goods imported and exported through the thirteen water wharves in Changsha increased by 38.9% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. Worker Tang Renduo said, "We haven't seen so many goods in more than ten years. Now we find it difficult to move just the grain."

With more goods, there is also more income, and with the elimination of feudal foremen in the first half of this year, the lives of workers have begun to improve. In the seventeen or eighteen winters before liberation, worker Zhou Binxiang covered himself with sacks at night and wore single-layer clothing during the day. This year, he alone bought a new cotton quilt, blanket, and a set of cotton clothes, cotton gowns, single-layer clothes, and lined clothes. All one hundred workers in the moving team where Old Zhou works have added new clothes this year. When talking about food, they said, "In the past, there was only breakfast but no supper, and we couldn't even eat enough for two meals a day. Now, we have a bowl of soy milk and two eggs for breakfast, and three meals of second-class rice a day, with fish and meat."

The workers deeply understand that such happy days are brought about by the new China led by Chairman Mao. In order to defend the motherland, they now donate one day's salary every month to buy airplanes and cannons. In order to make urban and rural exchanges in the motherland more prosperous, they try their best not to stockpile too many goods; they also take great care of the goods they transport, lifting and placing them gently, for fear of getting them wet or damaging them in any way. They say with confidence: In a few years, production in the city and countryside will develop even more, our country will be more prosperous and strong, our work will be more plentiful, and our lives will be better.

    善新码头的变迁
    新华社记者  刘海金  冯代松
    善新码头是长沙市十六个水陆码头中依傍湘江的一个码头。静静的湘江和她的许多支流，把长沙市和广大农村联系起来。近年来，湖南农产丰收，物资畅流，长沙市一天比一天繁荣。善新码头的热闹，正是城乡经济繁荣的一面镜子。这里，从早到晚，集散着大量的物资，人们在劳动的歌声中涌来涌去；数不清的船只，一字儿排到江边。码头上，棉花、砖瓦、粮食、洋纱、土纸、蛋品，堆积得像起伏的小山一样。
    解放前，农村破产，城乡阻塞，美货倾销，长沙市上只有几家供国民党官僚挥霍的筵席馆、化妆品商号和赌场最热闹，其余行业都岌岌垂危。善新码头当时是个冷落、贫穷、肮脏、吵架和被封建行会所把持的地方。河里的船一日半天才来一只。春天一到，码头两旁都长起了野草。码头工人周斌祥感叹地说：“那时，我们怎能不穷啊？！好容易拉到一笔生意，还要受封建把头剥削，伪钞票又不值钱，谁都顾不上嘴巴。”
    解放后，人民政府领导人民创造了新的生活。善新码头从去年四、五月起，就开始变样了。去年下半年，湖南农民获得了十多年来所未有的丰收。一船船的粮食，从农村的小河小港，四面八方涌向长沙，一来就是两三万石。城市工商业起货、卸货量逐渐加多。码头工人们忙开了。如今，不是有人没货运，而是货物运不完。工人刘回耕说，“这么多的货，都是两年来人民政府领导我们大家发展生产的结果。”
    的确，两年来湖南城乡经济已经起了翻天覆地的变化。今年全省工、农、林、手工各业生产量，比解放前增加了百分之三十五。由于城乡交流畅通，全省总值一百一十八亿斤稻谷的土产，百分之九十有了销路。著名产米区洞庭湖湖滨平原的人们说：“这两年，牛脚迹里都长谷。”善新码头对河的裕湘纱厂，今年需要比前年多一倍以上的搬运工人，才能运完每天的产品。全市工商业户数刚解放时只有五千七百多户，现在已经增加到一万五千多户。今年上半年，光是私商向外埠采购的物资数量，就比去年下半年增加了百分之二百七十三点六，街上熙熙攘攘，尽是买货卖货的人群。码头上的工人们也随着忙碌起来了。长沙市十三个水码头进出口的货物，今年上半年比去年同期增加了百分之三十八点九。工人汤仁朵说：“我们十几年从没看到来过这么多的货，现在光是搬运粮食都觉得费力。”
    货物一多，收入的力资也多，再加上今年上半年把封建把头反掉了，工人生活已开始上升。工人周斌祥在解放前的十七、八个冬天中，晚上盖的是麻袋，白天穿的是单衣。今年他一个人就新置了棉被、毯子和棉衣、棉袍、单衣、夹衣各一套。老周工作的那个搬运中队的一百个工友，今年全都添了新衣。谈到吃食时，他们说：“过去是有早无晚，一天两顿都吃不饱，如今早上一碗豆浆两个蛋，一日三餐二机米，有鱼又有肉。”
    工人们深深地懂得，这样幸福的日子是毛主席领导的新中国带来的。为了保卫祖国，他们现在每个月都捐献一天工资买飞机大炮。为了使祖国城乡交流更加畅旺，他们尽量做到了不积压太多的物资；对于搬运的物资也非常爱护，轻起轻放，生怕沾上水或弄坏了一点。他们满怀信心地说：再过几年，城里乡里生产更加发展了，我们的国家更加繁荣、强大，我们的工作也会更多，生活也会更好。
