[Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue on the 7th] Chiang's army, besieged in the spider web joint defense in the suburbs of Fushan, now dares not set foot in the second, third, fourth, and fifth districts that are far from the city. Even when operating in villages near the city, they cannot escape the entanglement of the spider web and are beaten everywhere. From December 3rd to December 31st, in 29 days, they were attacked 21 times, with 17 killed, wounded, and captured. The following are introductions to some of the more famous battles:

(1) Battle of Tiantan Mountain

On the 3rd, seven Chiang soldiers went to Tiantan Mountain to loot. The guards on the spider web sent out alerts to various places. Militia members Wu Guangyou and two others rushed to Tiantan Mountain and quietly ambushed. The Chiang soldiers grabbed two people and five sheep in Tiantan and returned. Wu Guangyou and others jumped out of the road and suddenly shot down two. The remaining five quickly abandoned the sheep and fled. Wu Guangyou chased them, driving the Chiang soldiers to the city walls of Tiantan. The Chiang soldiers, thinking Wu Guangyou had few men, surrounded them. At this time, Yang Yongguang and four others from the Yao Temple militia group came to help. Wu Guangyou and others broke through the encirclement and moved to the Jiangjiapo highlands to continue fighting. Explosives expert Chang Dengke and 24 others, hearing the alarm, took stone mines and flew to set up a minefield at Shanshuijiao, waiting for the Chiang soldiers. The Chiang soldiers chased Wu Guangyou but suddenly lost sight of him. They encountered Yang Yongguang and chased after him again. At this time, militia from Yao Temple, Zhengyuan, and other places rushed to the scene. The Chiang soldiers, seeing militia and gunfire everywhere, dared not pursue them relentlessly and turned to Shanshuijiao. With a loud bang, a stone mine exploded, blasting the Chiang soldiers, who turned around and ran. A squad from the first district also rushed to Wujiapo and ambushed on the Chiang soldiers' return route. At this time, the Chiang soldiers were tightly pursued by the militia behind them and were ambushed by the first district squad at Wujiapo. The Chiang soldiers in the city hurriedly came to assist but were also beaten back, with one platoon leader and two soldiers killed on the spot. After returning to the city, the Chiang soldiers said, "It's really strange, we just can't face the gunfire. As soon as the guns fire, we are surrounded on all sides."

(2) Battle of Chengnan Village

The next day, more than 700 Chiang soldiers in the city set out in several directions to Liang Village to seize grain. The guards on the spider web had already sent reports to various places. The Gu County militia group rushed to attack the Chiang soldiers in Liang Village. When the Chiang soldiers heading towards Chengnan Village were advancing, the village militia group had already laid stone mines at the village entrance and set up a position. When the Chiang soldiers approached, they fired first. The Chiang soldiers then fired high-intensity firepower, attempting to enter the village all at once, thus stepping on the stone mines, injuring several people. They dared not enter the village again. The village militia group moved to the highlands east of the village to monitor the Chiang soldiers' actions. The Dongguo group flew down the mountain from Jiheng. Seeing the situation was not good, the Chiang soldiers showed signs of retreat. At this time, Qin, the district chief of the first district, led the Chengguan militia group to fly out, combining with the Xiaowei militia to intercept the Chiang soldiers in three routes. At the same time, the Zhang Village militia group of Gu County City, which had been lying in wait, also began to attack. The Chengnan Village militia group also chased from behind, compressing the Chiang soldiers into the earthen kilns in the Guocun ditch, using firepower to seal the kiln entrances. At this time, the Beichen militia also arrived, waiting on the Chiang soldiers' return route. The Chiang soldiers who were looting in other places heard the gunfire and gathered at Shangbeichen, attempting to rescue the Chiang soldiers in the earthen kilns, but were surrounded by the militia there and three were wounded on the spot. The Chiang soldiers from Liang Village rushed to assist and cover their escape. The Chiang soldiers trapped in the earthen kilns thought that Chiang soldiers were coming to rescue them and were about to rush out when two were wounded by the militia, and they shrank back into the kilns. At this time, the militia groups of Gu County, Chengnan Village, Beichen, Dongguo, and others surrounded the Chiang soldiers separately. The militia sang war songs, and for a time the battlefield was filled with singing, gunfire, and laughter, making the Chiang soldiers both angry and hateful, both furious and painful. At 4:00 p.m., the Chiang soldiers in the city came out to reinforce but were intercepted by the Dongguo militia group and could not advance. This spider web battle lasted from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., freeing more than 20 villagers captured in Chengnan Village, killing two Chiang soldiers and wounding four. We suffered no casualties.

(3) Battle of Xizuo Village

On the 18th, a platoon of Chiang soldiers in the city advanced along the Linfu Highway towards Xizuo Village to meet with the Chiang soldiers in Beihan Village. The guards on the Linfu Line immediately sent out signals. The combat militia of Xizuo Village and Ge Village ambushed near Xiwailing in two routes. When the Chiang soldiers came within firing range, they suddenly jumped out and opened fire, killing one and wounding one. The militia quickly moved to other places. When the Chiang soldiers counter-attacked, they could not see anyone and had to leave the corpse and move forward with drooping heads. They hadn't gone far when suddenly several militia jumped out of the roadside and fired suddenly, and at the same time, a landmine sounded under their feet. For a time, dust filled the air, and the Chiang soldiers shouted, "It's over! It's over!" It turned out that they had fallen into an ambush by the Chengguan militia group. After being beaten several times, the Chiang soldiers turned around and ran. The next day, two platoons of Chiang soldiers, carrying two machine guns, went to the Xizuoling area in three routes to retaliate, one route through Ge Village and one route through Yang Village. After the vanguard sent out an alarm, militia groups from various places rose up and seized the Xizuoling highlands. When the Chiang soldiers climbed up the ridge, a few cold shots from the ridge killed one and wounded one. The militia immediately shifted their positions. When the Chiang soldiers used high-intensity firepower to cover the rush to the ridge, the militia had disappeared. They were angry and furious and turned to Xizuo Village to retaliate, but as soon as they approached the village, they were shot a few cold shots by the ambushing militia, and they hurriedly ran back to Xizuoling and swept wildly with machine guns. Helplessly, they had to go back, but when they reached Zhuangqiao, they stepped on a stone mine, and with a bang, the Chiang soldiers fled in panic.

　　浮山民兵蛛网联防
    蒋军处处挨打
  　城南村战斗中，民兵高唱战歌，气得蒋军哭笑不得。
    【本报太岳七日电】被围困在浮山城郊蛛网联防中的蒋军，现在对离城较远的二、三、四、五区已经不敢涉足，就连在城附近各村活动，也逃不出蛛网缠绕，处处挨打。自十二月三日至三十一日廿九天内，被打击二十一次，毙伤俘十七名。兹将其有名的战斗介绍于后：
  　（一）天坛山战斗
    三日，蒋军七人到天坛山抢劫，蛛网上的警卫哨向各地发出警报，民兵吴逛有等三人飞步赶上天坛山，悄悄地埋伏起来。蒋军在天坛里抓了两个人抢了五只羊往回返，吴逛有等从路口跳出来，猛然射击打倒两个，其余五人赶快撇下羊就跑，吴逛有便追赶，把蒋军赶到天坛城墙下，蒋军欺吴逛有人少，就包围上来，这时尧庙上民兵集团杨永广等四人前来助战，吴逛有等就冲出重围转到蒋家坡高地继续战斗，爆炸能手常登科等二十四人闻警，拿了石雷飞行前来，在山水角布下地雷阵，等待蒋军。蒋军追击吴逛有忽然不见了，遇见杨永广，便又追赶杨永广。此时尧庙、针垣等各地民兵均纷纷赶来，一时满山遍野的民兵与枪声，蒋军不敢穷追，就转到山水角，轰隆一声石雷爆发了，把蒋军炸得扭回头就跑，一区分队也赶到吴家坡，埋伏在蒋军的归路上，此时蒋军被后面的民兵紧紧追击，到吴家坡又中了一区分队的埋伏。城内蒋军连忙出来援助，也被打回去，当场打死班长一名，士兵两名，蒋军回城后说：“真奇怪，就不敢见枪声，枪一响四面都包围上来了。”
　  （二）城南村战斗
    翌日城内蒋军七百余人分路出发到梁村抢粮，蛛网上的警卫已向各地发出报告，古县民兵集团赶来打击梁村蒋军，往城南村之蒋军正前进时，该村民兵集团已在村口埋下石雷，布下阵地，待蒋军接近时首先发枪，蒋军便发射高度火力，企图一下子进村子，因此踏响了石雷，炸伤数人，就不敢再进村，该村民兵集团又移到村东高地监视蒋军行动。东郭集团从鸡垣飞行下山，蒋军见势不佳，有退却模样。这时一区秦区长又领导城关民兵集团飞越而出，与小卫民兵结合分三路阻击蒋军，同时预伏着的古县城张庄民兵集团也开始攻击，城南村民兵集团又从后追击，将蒋军压缩到果村沟的土窑内，用火力将窑洞口封锁起来。此时北陈民兵又赶到在蒋军归路上等候。这时在其他各处抢劫的蒋军听见枪声就集中到上北陈，企图来援救土窑里的蒋军，但又在该处被民兵围困，当场被打伤三名，经梁村的蒋军赶来援助掩护才狼狈窜回。被困在土窑里的蒋军以为外面有蒋军来援救，正待外冲时被民兵打伤两人，又缩回窑内，此时古县、城南村，北陈、东郭等村民兵集团分头将蒋军围困起来。民兵们高唱战歌，一时战场上歌声枪声夹着笑声，逼的蒋军又气又恨又怒又痛。下午四时城内蒋军出来增援又被东郭民兵集团阻击，无法前进。这一仗蛛网战斗从上午十时直打到下午五时才结束，共解放城南村被抓群众廿余人，打死蒋军两名打伤四名，我无一损伤。
  　（三）西佐村战斗
    十八日，城内蒋军一个排沿临浮公路向西佐村方向前进、和北韩村蒋军会合，临浮线上的警卫哨随即发出信号，西佐村、葛村战斗民兵分两路在西偎岭附近埋伏，待蒋军近入射程以内时，突然跃出开火，当下打死一人，打伤一名，民兵便迅速地转移到别处，待蒋军反冲锋过来，不见一人，只得丢下尸首垂头丧气的前进，没走多远，忽然路边又跳出几个民兵猛然射击，同时脚底下又响起地雷，一时灰尘弥漫，蒋军连声叫：“糟了！糟了！”原来是中了城关民兵集团的埋伏。蒋军挨了几次打后，回头就跑。第二天蒋军两个排携机枪两挺，分三路向西佐岭一带报复，一路经葛村，一路经杨村，前卫哨发出警报后，各地民兵集团纷纷起来，并抢占西佐岭高地，当蒋军向岭上爬时，岭上几声冷枪打死一个打伤一个，民兵立即转移阵地，待蒋军用高度火力掩护冲到岭上时，民兵已无踪无影，他们又气又怒就转向西佐村报复，不料刚走近村子，又被埋伏的民兵打了几下冷枪，又急忙跑上西佐岭用机枪乱扫一阵，无可奈何之下，只好往回走，不料走到庄桥时又踏响了石雷，轰隆一声，蒋军抱头鼠窜而逃。
