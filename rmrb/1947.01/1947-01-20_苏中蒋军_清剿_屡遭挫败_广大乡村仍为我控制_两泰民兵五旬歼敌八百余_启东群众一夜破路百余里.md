Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: According to comprehensive reports from various locations, in the past two months or so, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in Central Jiangsu, in their attempts to consolidate the occupied areas through "encirclement and suppression" and "blockade" plans, have been repeatedly frustrated by the combined resistance of the local New Fourth Army, local armed forces, militia guerrillas, and the broad masses. The vast areas remain under the control of the people.

Beginning on October 26th of last year, Chiang's troops, with the 437th Regiment of the 21st Division and the puppet troops of Xu Rong's Independent Regiment of the Songhu Garrison Command, along with local "Security Regiments" and "Homecoming Legions," launched an "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Haimen and Qidong areas. As of December 16th, Chiang's troops, at the cost of over 300 casualties, only managed to occupy the towns of Huilong and Taian. Out of the 160 towns and cities and 39 ports in Haimen and Qidong counties, 149 towns and cities and 36 ports remain in the hands of the people. The Chiang-appointed county magistrates of Haimen and Qidong were both dismissed for "ineffective encirclement and suppression."

Starting from December 17th, Chiang's puppet troops began their so-called second "encirclement and suppression" campaign. In addition to the aforementioned units, the 79th Brigade of the 49th Division, which had previously participated in the northward invasion of Yancheng, was also transferred back. On New Year's Eve, they began "encirclement and suppression" in the Rudong area, advancing eastward in parallel along the Shuangdian-Gagang line and the Pincha-Juzhen line. On the 2nd, they converged in Nanshang and Beishang, and on the 3rd, they turned south, briefly intruding into the area from Jiumianzha to Beixinqiao in central Nantong. Under our resistance, they were forced to retreat back to Gagang. Of the 15 towns and cities occupied by this Chiang's troops, 10 have already been recovered by the people. As of the 5th of this month, Chiang's troops had suffered 120 casualties.

Chiang's troops in Nantong attempted to control the Nantong-Shigang Highway, cutting off the eastern and western parts of Nantong, and to open up the Nantong-Haimen Highway, dividing Nantong into northern and southern blocks, in order to facilitate their "encirclement and suppression." However, under the slogan of "repairing during the day, destroying at night, opening to the east, destroying to the west" by the people along the route, repeated sabotage was carried out, and Chiang's plan could not be realized. The Chiang's troop strongholds in Nantong's Shizongdian were all eliminated by the people on December 18th.

The people's armed forces in Liangtai (Taixing and Taixian) fought 252 battles in 50 days from November to mid-December of last year, killing, wounding, and capturing 885 Chiang's troops, destroying 232 bunkers, and damaging 220 li of highways. In the anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggles in various places, many glorious battle examples were created. In mid-December, the Qidong local armed forces annihilated 27 Chiang's troops in Daxing Village, seizing two machine guns and 14 rifles, without suffering any casualties themselves. On the 5th of this month, the Taixing militia blocked Chiang's troops advancing from Huangqiao at Diaojiazhuang, killing more than 80 enemies at the cost of only one martyr. In the battle of Beixin Street in northeast Taixing, a large landmine killed more than 20 Chiang's troops and horses. The Qidong militia, in conjunction with the broad masses, destroyed over 100 li of highways in one night. The Qidong guerrillas also briefly broke into Qidong city on November 26th, destroying a large bridge. The anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle is still continuing and expanding in various parts of Central Jiangsu.

　　苏中蒋军“清剿”屡遭挫败
    广大乡村仍为我控制
    两泰民兵五旬歼敌八百余
    启东群众一夜破路百余里
    【新华社华中十八日电】综合各地消息，近两月余以来，苏中蒋伪军企图巩固其侵占区所进行之“清剿”“封锁”计划，在当地新四军地方武装与民兵游击队及广大群众合力反击下连遭挫败，广大地区始终控制在人民手中。去年十月廿六日开始，蒋军以二十一师之四三七团及淞沪卫戍司令部独立团徐容部伪军，配合当地“保安团”“还乡团”等，对海门、启东地区进行“清剿”。至十二月十六日止，蒋军以损失三百余人的代价，仅占了汇龙、泰安两镇。海启两县一百六十个市镇中的一百四十九个、三十九条港中的三十六条，至今均在人民手中。蒋记海、启两县长以“清剿不力”均被撤职，从十二月十七日起，蒋伪军又开始其所谓第二次“清剿”，除上述各部外，原参加北犯盐城之四十九师七十九旅亦调回，于除夕开始“清剿”如（皋）东地区，先后沿双甸、挂港线、拼茶苴镇线两路平行东犯，二日于南商北商会合后，复于三日转向南犯，曾侵至南通中部九面闸至北新桥一线，在我阻击下被迫缩回挂港。该路蒋军侵占之十五个市镇，已有十座为人民收复。至本月五日止，蒋军损失已达百二十人。南通蒋军曾企图控制南（通）石（港）公路、隔断南通东西两部，打通南（通）海（门）公路，分割南通成南北两块，以便利其“清剿”。但在沿线人民“日里通、夜里破，东面通，西面破”的口号下，展开反复破击，蒋军计划无法实现。南通十总店蒋军据点于十二月十八日均为人民所拔除。两泰（泰兴、泰县）人民武装，自去年十一月至十二月中旬五十天内作战二百五十二次，毙伤俘蒋军八百八十五名，毁碉堡二百三十二处，破公路二百二十里。在各地反“清剿”斗争中，创造了不少光辉的战斗范例。启东地方武装十二月中旬在大兴村歼灭蒋军二十七人，缴机枪两挺，步枪十四支，自己无一伤亡。本月五日，泰兴民兵阻击黄桥出犯蒋军于刁家庄，仅以牺牲战士一名的代价击毙敌人八十余。泰兴东北北新街一役，曾以一个大地雷炸毙蒋军人马各二十余。启东民兵与广大群众结合，曾以万人于一夜破击公路百余里，启东游击队并曾于十一月二十六日一度突入启东城，破毁大桥一座。现苏中各地反“清剿”斗争仍在继续扩大中。
