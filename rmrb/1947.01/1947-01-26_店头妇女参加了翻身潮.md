Women of Diantou Participate in the Emancipation Tide

In the thoroughgoing stage of the “cutting off the tail” (sweeping away feudal remnants) movement in Diantou Village, Eighth District of Wu'an, the women, who were always considered "unable to be helped up," not only stood up tall, but also played a significant role in the struggle.

Before December, the women of Diantou were the main target of the landlords Yang Shiliang and Yang Guozheng for winning over and deceiving. In the several mass movement upsurges of the past year or so, due to insufficient attention to mobilizing women, they generally stood outside the circle of the movement. Most of the seventy-odd members of the women's association were old and weak, and did not care about village affairs. The landlords' wives often worked together with the peasant women, carrying water and pretending to be affectionate. The peasant women lacked class awareness and said, "The old rich people have become good now!" They leaked information about the peasant association through idle gossip, forming a situation where men fought while women let out secrets. Some women were even willing to preserve property for the landlords, which added many difficulties to the peasant association's work (such as debt collection). The landlords secretly said, "We are not afraid that they (referring to the peasants) will change their time, but we are afraid that they will change their hearts." And those whose "hearts had not changed" were mostly the women.

In the thoroughgoing movement from December to this month, mobilizing peasant women was made one of the main tasks. The peasant association first conducted education for its members on "mobilizing the whole family to struggle, only then can emancipation be thorough," calling on everyone to mobilize their wives and sisters to participate in the struggle and join the peasant association.

Targeting the women's backward thinking, peasant families universally discussed how the landlords treated them when there was no struggle in the past. The women recalled the past when they had to endure cold looks from the landlords when borrowing livestock for grinding; when they did needlework for the landlords, their own children went hungry, and they were not given even a bran cornbread when they asked for it, as well as the beatings and abuse they suffered when cooking for the landlords, grinding their teeth with hatred. Then they discussed: "Why are the landlords still good to us women when they have been struggled against and suffered grievances from our men?" At this time, the women all realized that the landlords' wives' current approach was a conspiracy. Some remembered the fact that they had unintentionally "leaked secrets" to the landlords, and they resolved not to approach the landlords again, and to fight the landlords together with the men.

Immediately afterwards, a women's congress was held, and all the young and middle-aged women from each family came voluntarily. The village cadres first reviewed their past mistakes in not resolving the problems raised by some women and causing some women to be rebuffed, and encouraged everyone: If you still have opinions about the cadres, speak out boldly and help the cadres correct them. Those who raised opinions were praised and apologized to on the spot. The women's emotions became even more active.

At the mass meeting in the village to settle accounts and pour out grievances against the big landlords and bullies Yang Guozheng and more than ten others, many women tore off their masks and accused the landlords of their crimes and the oppression they had suffered. After being praised on the spot by the leadership, the women were even more determined to participate in the debt collection struggle, demanding that the landlords return the money and grain that they had unreasonably owed to the peasants.

The leadership helped the women separate into groups to collect debts and organized competitions among the groups, competing with the men. The active women encouraged everyone: "We want the men to look up to us, so we have to achieve results!" The women were unwilling to show weakness and bravely went forward. During the debt collection, the landlords were particularly cunning towards the women, even putting on the airs of the past and saying, "If there is no money, there is no money!" This made the women more deeply aware of the landlords' true colors. When they came back, they said angrily: "We are not begging him for famine relief (borrowing money)! We can't take this abuse!" Seeing this emotion, the leadership immediately expressed its firm support for everyone and called on everyone to continue the struggle.

It so happened that all the men in the village had set off to carry coal and would be gone for three days. Some women advocated "wait until the men come back to fight!" But this was rejected by the majority of women. They said: "We won't wait! We can do it without the men!" The next day, all the women in the village were mobilized. Without even eating, they worked from early morning until the second watch of the night [around 10 PM]! They moved all the furniture and property that four landlord families had plundered from the peasants but were unwilling to return. The old ladies, lacking strength, volunteered to stand guard at the street entrance, and some took care of the children for the young and middle-aged women.

The leadership seized the opportunity to help the women gather for a summary meeting at the second watch of the night, pointing out the rationality and legality of this struggle, and praising and encouraging them. After calculating, these things were not enough to compensate, and everyone resolved to pursue the landlords for hidden materials.

In the continuing debt collection struggle the next day, the women angrily beat the most stubborn landlords who resolutely denied their debts, forcing them to take out things to compensate. This was something they would not have dared to imagine in the past. An old lady said, "I'm so old, what am I afraid of! Today, I will vent all the grievances of my life!" Although they still retained worries about a change of regime, they had clearly taken a big step forward, ideologically separated from the landlords, and joined the peasant association. Now, there are one hundred and thirty women who have joined the peasant association. Among them, there are fifty-odd young and middle-aged women and twenty-odd old women, all of whom are courageous and politically active. Many peasants who used to look down on women said, "I never thought women had such great strength, such great power, that even without men, women alone can overwhelm the landlords!"

    店头妇女参加了翻身潮
    武安八区店头村在深入阶段的割尾巴（扫荡封建残余）运动中，一向被认为“扶不起来”的妇女群众，不仅已挺胸站起，并在斗争中起了很大的作用。
    十二月以前，店头的妇女曾是该村大地主杨适良与杨国正等拉拢欺骗的主要对象。在一年多的几次群众运动高潮中，由于领导上注意发动妇女不够，她们一般站在运动圈外。妇女会七十来个会员，大都年老力衰，不问村事。地主的妇女便时常与农民妇女到一块做活，抬水，假装亲热。农妇没有阶级警觉，都说：“老财们这会子变好啦！”把农会的事从拉闲话中泄与对方，形成男人斗争，女人透气。甚至个别妇女愿为地主保存财物，使农会工作（如讨账等）增加不少困难。地主暗地里说：“不怕他们（指农民）变了时光，就怕他们变了心。”而“心没变的”，大部是妇女群众。
    十二月至本月份的深入运动中，发动农民妇女被提为主要任务之一。农会对自己会员，首先进行了“发动全家都来斗争，翻身才能彻底”的教育，号召大家都把自己的妻子姐妹发动起来参加斗争、参加农会。
    针对着妇女们的落后思想，农民家庭普遍讨论：以前没斗争的时候，地主怎样对待咱的。妇女们回忆到过去向地主借牲口碾磨都要遭白眼；给地主做针线，自己孩子挨饿，向人家要个糠窝窝都不给，以及给地主做饭时挨打受气等痛苦，恨得咬牙。接着讨论：“地主挨了咱家男人斗争，受了气，为啥还对咱女人好？”此时，妇女都认识到地主女人现在与自己接近是一种阴谋。有的想起自己无意中给地主“透了气”的事实，决心不再与地主接近。要跟男人们一道对地主斗争。
    紧接着召开妇女大会，各家青壮妇女都自动来了。村干部首先把自己过去对某些妇女提出的问题没有解决，给个别妇女碰过钉子等错误作了检讨，并鼓励大家：如果对干部还有意见，都大胆讲出，帮干部纠正。有个别提意见的，当场表扬并认错。妇女们的情绪更加活跃起来。
    在全村群众向大地主恶霸杨国正等十余人清算诉苦的大会上，好些妇女都撕破脸控诉了地主的罪恶与自己身受的欺侮，经过领导上当场表扬，妇女更决心参加要账斗争，向地主讨索无理拖欠农民的钱粮等。
    领导上帮妇女分开小组去要账，并组织各组竞赛，与男人竞赛。积极妇女鼓舞大家：“咱要叫男人看起咱，咱就要有成绩！”妇女们不肯示弱，都勇敢前去。要账中，地主对妇女特别狡赖，甚至摆出往日的架子说：“没钱就是没钱！”这使妇女更深刻认识了地主的面目，回来时气愤的说：“咱又不是求他打饥荒（借钱）哩！咱不能受这气！”领导上看到这种情绪，马上表示坚决给大家撑腰，号召大家继续斗争。
    恰巧全村男子都出发去驮煤了，要走三天。个别妇女主张“等汉们回来再斗！”但被大多数妇女否决了。他们说：“咱不等！没有汉们咱也能干！”第二天，全村妇女总动员，饭都不吃，从早起干到二更天！把四家地主掠自农民又不肯退还农民的许多家具财物一齐搬了。老太太没力气，自报奋勇在街口站岗，有的给青壮妇女看孩子。
    领导上抓紧热气，就在二更天帮妇女集会总结，指出这种斗争的合理合法，表扬与鼓舞她们。算了算账，这些东西不够赔，大家决心向地主追索隐藏物资。
    在第二天的继续讨账斗争中，妇女们激怒地殴打了坚决抵赖的最顽固地主，逼着他们拿出东西来赔偿。这是她们过去不敢想像的事。一个老太太说：“我这大年纪啦，我还怕啥！今天我非把这一辈子冤气出透不行！”她们虽然残存着变天顾虑，但已显然向前大进一步，思想上和地主分了家，加入了农会。现在，加入农会的妇女已有一百三十人。其中有五十来个青壮妇女与二十多个老妇女，都是敢做敢当，政治上很积极的。许多从前轻视妇女的农民说：“真没想到妇女也有这大的劲、这大的力量，这会子就是没有男人，光女人也能压倒地主啦！”
