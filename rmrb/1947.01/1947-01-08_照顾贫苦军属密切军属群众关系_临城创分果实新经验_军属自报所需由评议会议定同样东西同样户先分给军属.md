[This article reports on the successful experiences in caring for impoverished military families and strengthening military-civilian relations.]

    [This dispatch] (by Liu Zijian of the Taihang Administrative Office of Civil Affairs) reports: Lin Cheng County has gained preliminary experience in how to care for impoverished military families and resolve conflicts between military families and the masses during the distribution of the fruits of victory. The county has adopted four methods. The first method was to allow military families to pick the best items, with the remainder being distributed to the masses. As a result, military families who were active, bold, and somewhat selfish received too much, leading to the following: (1) discontent among the masses, such as villagers saying, "Everything has been given to the military families after a day of struggle," causing military families to become isolated from the masses; (2) some military families who were honest but less advanced were afraid to boldly ask for the fruits of victory and could not improve their situation. The second method was to distribute the fruits of victory equally to all military families, regardless of wealth. This resulted in uneven distribution, and impoverished military families still could not improve their situation. The third method was to distribute the fruits of victory to military families in the same way as to the masses, and then to extract a portion from the total fruits of struggle to give preferential treatment to military families. Some villages used this method when distributing furniture and miscellaneous items, but it was not as good as the fourth method. The fourth method is: each family reports its needs, which are assessed by the evaluation committee. For the same type of household and the same items, military families are given priority, with more being given to poor peasant military families and less to middle peasant military families, leveling up from bottom to top. This method is very satisfactory to military families, and the masses have no objections. When using this method, some villages also gave special care to impoverished military families with special difficulties. For example, in Dongshu Village, there was a family of a martyr with only an old man. His biggest difficulty was that he had no clothes to wear, so the village first gave him several extra pieces of clothing. The old man was so happy that he told everyone he met, "The Eighth Route Army is so kind!" However, judging from the situation in various places, ideological education for military families in the distribution of the fruits of victory is not sufficient. As a result, although military families have improved their economic situation, their political awareness has not improved enough. Some military families do not understand that sending their sons to join the army is directly for the purpose of defending their own fruits of victory. This work should have been carried out during the movement and the distribution of the fruits of victory, but it has had to be delayed. However, this deficiency must be seriously made up for in the future. As for some honest households, backward households, and single men among military families, the leadership is now paying attention to checking whether there are any omissions, in order to make supplementary distributions so that every military family can improve its situation and establish a household.

    照顾贫苦军属密切军属群众关系
    临城创分果实新经验
    军属自报所需由评议会议定同样东西同样户先分给军属
    【本报讯】分果实中如何照顾贫苦军属，以及解决军属与群众间的矛盾，临城已获得初步经验。据太行行署民政处刘子坚同志报导：该县曾采用四种办法，第一种是无论什么东西，都由军属拣头分，剩下的再分给群众。这样，积极敢干而又自私心较大的军属分东西过多，结果：（一）惹起群众不满，如某村群众说：“斗半天都给军属斗了。”致使军属脱离群众。（二）一部分比较老实但又落后的军属，则不敢大胆的要果实，而不能翻身。第二种是不分穷富，军属都按头等分果实，结果肥瘦不均，穷苦军属仍然翻不了身。第三种是军属先和群众一样分，然后再从总的斗争果实中抽出一部分优待军属。个别村在分配家具及零碎东西时曾用此法。但仍不如第四种办法为好。第四种办法是：各取所需，由军属自报，经评议会评议，同样户同样东西，先尽军属，贫农军属多分，中农军属少分，由下而上填平补齐。这种办法军属很满意，群众也没意见。有的村在用此法时，并对有特殊困难的贫苦军属，加以特别照顾。如东竖村有一家烈属，只有一个老汉，当前最大困难是没衣服穿，村上就首先多给他分了几件衣服。老汉高兴得见人就说：“八路军真好心！”但就各地情况来看，分果实中对军属的思想教育还不够，致使军属虽在经济上翻了身，但政治觉悟提高则很不够，有的军属不了解送子参军是直接为了保卫自己的果实。此本应在运动中，分果实时进行的工作，不得不拖延下来，但今后必须认真弥补此一缺陷。至于军属中的某些老实户、落后户、光棍汉，领导上现正注意检查是否有遗漏现象，以求补分，使每户军属都得以翻身，建立家务。
