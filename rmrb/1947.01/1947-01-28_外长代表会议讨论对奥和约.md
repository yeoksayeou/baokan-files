Since the opening of the meeting on the 14th, a wide exchange of views has been held on the procedural issues of the German-Austrian peace treaty for a week. Since the 20th, the discussion has focused on the Austrian issue. Formal meetings have discussed the political clauses, borders, and the withdrawal of Allied forces in the British, American, and French draft Austrian peace treaty. It was decided to hear the opinions of the representatives of the six Allied nations on the Austrian peace treaty simultaneously from the 22nd. The Czech representative was invited to speak on the 22nd, followed by Poland and Yugoslavia on the 23rd, Australia on the 24th, South Africa on the 25th, Canada on the 26th, and Austria on the 27th. In their speeches, the Czech, Polish, and Yugoslav representatives condemned Austria as the vanguard for Germany's enslavement of the Slavic people, arguing that everything that caused Austria to participate in the war should be destroyed. Everything caused by the German-Austrian merger should be eliminated. They proposed suggestions such as completely eliminating Nazism in Austria, as well as certain territorial and compensation conditions. In addition, experts from the four countries are simultaneously studying the Allied nations' memoranda on the German peace treaty.
