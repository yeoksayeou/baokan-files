The Taihang District Party Committee
Regulations on Standards and Specific Classifications for Rural Class Divisions

At present, with the implementation of land reform and the realization of "land to the tiller," rural class relations have undergone tremendous changes. Whether in new or old areas, a correct distinction and classification of the situation and status of various classes and strata in rural areas is necessary in order to correctly implement the Party's various policies. To this end, the Taihang District Party Committee, based on the new situation, has re-compiled and proposed the "Regulations on Standards and Specific Classifications for Rural Class Divisions" for local study and adoption.

When classifying rural classes, four standards must first be grasped: First, the most basic standard, the relationship and nature of exploitation, must be grasped. To determine which class a certain farm household belongs to, it is necessary to understand its production relationship with others. Is it exploiting others? Or being exploited? Is it mainly or partially? What is the method and nature of its exploitation, feudal or wage-labor? Second, consider the existence and amount of means of production such as land, labor, livestock, and farm implements. Third, look at the specific situation of their daily life, whether it is rich or poor. Fourth, understand the current foundation and historical development of the farm household, understand its past position in the production relationship, the ownership of the means of production, the reasons for subsequent changes, and the current situation. In addition, when classifying, it is necessary to pay attention to the local economic conditions and the people's living standards. For example, the amount of land occupied, the fertility, the size of the mu, and the living standards of the people in northern Henan and southeastern Shanxi are different, and specific research and regulations are needed.

Regarding the specific classification of rural classes and strata:

I. Landlord Class: Those who have historically occupied land for a long time, do not labor themselves, or only perform auxiliary labor, and mainly rely on renting out land to extract rent and exploit farmers to maintain their parasitic life are called landlords. Some of them also engage in usury, industry and commerce, and employ labor for management and various forms of super-economic exploitation, but land rent is the main thing. In specific classification, the following points should be noted:

1.  Division of large, medium, and small landlords. Those who have strong economic and political power, not only ruling general farmers, but also ruling some small and medium landlords, not only ruling one village, but also ruling several villages or larger areas are called large landlords. Small and medium landlords only have a smaller ruling scope.

2.  Managing Landlords. They are part of the landlord class. Their main characteristic is: adopting wage-labor management methods, relying on exploiting wage labor to live a parasitic and enjoyable life. They do not participate in major labor themselves, and participate in rent exploitation and other feudal exploitation, and have rural feudal characteristics, so they are classified as the landlord class.

3.  Bankrupt Landlords. Those who have lost all or most of their land property due to some reason (not caused by mass movements), but still do not engage in labor and production, and rely on debts, scams, relatives, or other sources to continue their landlord life or impoverished life, are called bankrupt landlords.

4.  "Second Landlords." Those who sublet landlords' land to farmers and live by exploiting rent, as well as "estate heads," "account managers," and "managers" for landlords, who have real power and whose family life mainly relies on sharing the rent that landlords exploit from farmers, are called "second landlords." Those who have no real power and do not get much wealth and grain, and whose families mainly rely on family labor, cannot be called "second landlords."

5.  Landlords Whose Class Status Has Not Changed After Struggle. In old areas (or areas that have only undergone initial mobilization), some landlords have undergone struggle, have very little land, and their lives have greatly declined, but their lives are still mainly maintained by land rent exploitation from farmers, and they do not engage in other production and labor, and are still landlords.

6.  Transformation of Landlords. After liquidation and struggle, the landlords' mode of production has changed, relying on the remaining land for self-cultivation and self-sufficiency, or changing their exploitation status due to family separation, or turning to industrial and commercial management. When entering a new production relationship is relatively stable and certain, their current class status should be used for classification, but it should be prefixed with "descending" managing landlord, rich peasant, middle peasant, or poor peasant.

It should be noted here that middle and poor peasants, especially military dependents, cadres' dependents, and the widowed who rent out land due to lack of labor caused by public service, cannot be called landlords.

II. Rich Peasants: They are the bourgeoisie in rural areas. They generally own a large amount of land, and their families also participate in major labor. The exploitation of wage labor accounts for a large proportion of their total production income. They live a wealthy life and have annual savings. In addition, some also rent out land, engage in rent exploitation, usury exploitation (this is the feudal exploitation part of rich peasants), and engage in industry and commerce (belonging to capitalist nature), all should be classified according to the specific situation.

1.  Old Rich Peasants. After mass movements or after being struggled against, they may still maintain or expand their wage-labor management and develop production according to their production conditions. However, due to concerns or avoidance of increasing capital, they shrink production and dismiss hired laborers. During the busy farming season, some temporarily hire a large number of short-term workers, or hire labor through mutual aid teams, or use relatives' labor to carry out production. In essence, they still mainly rely on wage labor exploitation, and their class status remains unchanged.

2.  Rich Peasants in "Organized" Collective Labor. Some rich peasants participate in mutual aid teams, specifically using wages or livestock to exchange for labor in the mutual aid teams, without hiring long-term workers. In essence, this is wage-labor exploitation disguised in the form of equal value exchange. Anyone who has used this kind of exploitation for more than three months (four months for two crops) should be classified as a rich peasant.

3.  New Rich Peasants. Those peasants who have become wealthy due to rent reduction and emancipation and must hire labor for more than three months throughout the year (four months for two crops) should be considered rich peasants. Those with lower exploitative tendencies can be called prosperous middle peasants.

4.  Descending Rich Peasants. Those who have descended from landlords and managing landlords and meet the aforementioned characteristics.

5.  Transformation of Rich Peasants. Due to mass movements or other reasons, their production conditions are weakened, their wage labor management methods have changed, and their new production relations are relatively stable and regular, their class status can be classified according to the current situation, but with distinctions from other peasants.

In addition, middle and poor peasants, especially military dependents and cadres' dependents, who hire labor due to lack of labor caused by public service, cannot be called rich peasants.

III. Middle Peasants: They are the petty bourgeoisie in rural areas. They basically do not exploit others, nor are they exploited by others, and live a life of self-cultivation and self-sufficiency. In old liberated areas, due to "organizing" production, they can also have surpluses, achieving "cultivating three and having one to spare."

1.  New Middle Peasants. After mass movements and land reform, poor and hired peasants who have obtained land and other production conditions and initially have middle peasant conditions should be classified as new middle peasants.

2.  Middle Peasants Who Should Not Change and Should Change. Those who change their management methods due to enemy destruction, or due to disasters and diseases, or due to family members joining the army or leaving production to become cadres, due to reduced labor, should still be classified as middle peasants. Some middle peasants, due to losing land and other production conditions, cannot recover in a short period of time, and their class status should be classified according to current conditions. Those who meet the conditions of rich peasants can be classified as new rich peasants.

3.  Descending Middle Peasants. Those who have descended from landlords, etc., and meet the aforementioned conditions, all belong to this category.

4.  Prosperous Middle Peasants. In addition to their own labor, they also have partial exploitation of others and live a prosperous life.

IV. Poor Peasants: They are the semi-proletariat in rural areas. They have a small amount of land, which is not enough to maintain their lives, and they sell their labor or are subjected to debt exploitation, and live a poor life.

1.  New Poor Peasants. Those who have obtained part of the land and other production conditions from workers, hired peasants, and the very poor and are equivalent to poor peasants belong to this category.

2.  Descending Poor Peasants. Those who have descended from landlords, etc., and whose production and living conditions are the same as poor peasants, should be classified as descending poor peasants.

3.  The Utterly Poor. The utterly poor belong to the poor peasant class.

V. Workers and Handicraft Workers in Rural Areas.

1.  Hired Peasants: They are the proletariat in rural areas. Generally, they have no land and tools at all, or only have very little land and tools, and completely or mainly maintain their family life by selling their labor (including sheep workers and cattle workers).

2.  Handicraft Workers: They generally have no production tools or only simple tools. They have their own skills, are employed by others, move around, and make a living by selling their labor. They do not purchase raw materials themselves, sell finished products, or make some finished products themselves, but this does not account for the main part of their income. Such as carpenters, stonemasons, plasterers, etc. are all handicraft workers.

3.  Workers: They generally have no land, capital, or tools, and make a living by selling their labor. Divided into miners, factory workers, industrial workers, coolies, etc.

4.  Handicraft Workers and Handicraft Owners. Those who have their own production tools, are not employed by others, labor themselves, purchase raw materials themselves, and sell finished products, and this is the main part of their total income, such as some carpenters and silversmiths, should be classified as handicraft workers. Those who have their own production capital, operate workshops, hire labor, participate in major labor themselves, purchase raw materials, and sell finished products should be classified as handicraft owners, because they mainly exploit wage labor, and their capital and operating scale are larger.

VI. Merchants. Those who use capital to engage in business and seek profits as the main source of livelihood should be classified as merchants. When classifying, they should be distinguished according to the amount of capital, the size of profits, the degree of life, and the position in the market.

1.  Small Vendors: Those who have only a small amount of capital, have no fixed address (hawkers), and have no fixed business are small vendors.

2.  Small Merchants: Those who occupy a small amount of capital, sell and operate themselves, equivalent to poor and middle peasants, are small merchants.

3.  Medium Merchants: Those who occupy a considerable amount of capital, employ shop assistants and clerks in addition to self-operation, and have a considerable position in the market, equivalent to rich peasants and small landlords, are medium merchants.

4.  Large Merchants: Those who occupy a large amount of capital, employ managers and clerks, and have a monopoly in the market are large merchants or commercial capitalists.

VII. Other Categories:

1.  Vagrants: Refers to those who are long-term alienated from production and rely on illegal occupations for a living, such as beggars, petty thieves, gamblers, bandits, prostitutes, etc. (Note: This type of vagrant cannot exist in fact after the complete implementation of land reform). Those with rogue habits should not be included. As for idlers and lazy people who are lazy and do not engage in production themselves, they should be classified according to their family composition and noted as lazy people.

2.  Superstitious Professionals: Those who specialize in religious and superstitious methods as the main source of livelihood, such as pastors, monks, Taoists, nuns, fortune tellers, physiognomists, witches, geomancers, etc. Those whose families do not take this as the main source of livelihood can determine their composition separately.

3.  Old Performers: Those who do not engage in production activities and specialize in playing with some kind of technique for a living, such as acting, martial arts, juggling, suona players, etc., are all classified as old performers.

4.  Freelancers: Including doctors, teachers, reporters, artists, etc., should be distinguished according to their family background and their relationship with the family. Those who mainly rely on this to supply family life should be classified as freelancers.

5.  Retired Soldiers: Should be determined specifically according to their current production conditions and mode of production.

6.  The Solitary and Widowed: Should understand their historical situation, the process of change, and the current situation, determine them separately, and classify them into various classes, and should not be confused with the very poor or classified as a separate class.

　　太行区党委
    关于农村阶级划分标准与具体划分的规定
    目前进行土地改革，实现耕者有其田，农村阶级关系起了巨大的变动。不论新区或老区，对于农村的各个阶级阶层的情况与地位，都需加以正确的区别与划分，以便正确的贯彻党的各种政策。为此，太行区党委特根据新的情况，对农村阶级划分问题，重新综合提出“关于农村阶级划分标准与具体划分的规定”，提供各地研究与酌量采用。
    在划分农村阶级时，首先要把握四个标准：第一，必须掌握住一个最基本标准，即剥削关系与性质。要确定某一农户属于何阶层，必须了解他与别人的生产关系，是剥削别人的？还是被剥削的？是主要的还是部分的？其剥削的方式与性质，是封建的还是雇佣的。第二，看其生产手段如土地、劳力、畜力、农具等的有无与多少。第三，看其日常生活的富裕或贫苦的具体情况。第四，该农户的现在基础和历史发展情形，了解其过去在生产关系中的地位，生产手段的占有情况，以后变化的原因，以及现在的情况。此外，在划分时，需要注意到当地的经济条件与人民生活的水准，如豫北与晋东南人民占有的土地数量、肥瘦、亩的大小、生活水平都不一样，需要具体研究规定。
    关于农村各个阶级、阶层的具体划分：
    一、地主阶级：在历史上长期的占有土地，自己不劳动，或只有附属劳动，主要靠出租土地榨取地租，剥削农民以维持其寄生生活的叫做地主。他们中亦有兼放高利贷、兼营工商业、兼用雇工经营及各种超经济的剥削等，但地租是主要的。具体的划分时，则应注意如下几点：
    １、大、中、小地主的划分。凡在经济上、政治上具有强大的统治力量，不但统治一般农民，并且统治某些中小地主，不只统治一村，并且统治数村或更大地区者叫做大地主。中小地主只是统治范围较小。
    ２、经营地主。是地主阶级的一部分，其主要特点是：采用雇佣经营方式，靠剥削雇佣劳动来过其寄生的享受的生活。自己又不参加主要劳动，并参加地租剥削和其他封建剥削，具有农村封建性，故划规地主阶级。
    ３、破产地主。因故（非群众运动所致）丧失了全部或大部土地财产，但仍不从事劳动和生产，靠赊欠诳骗、亲友接济或其他来路，仍过着其地主生活或破落生活者，叫破产地主。
    ４、“二地主”。以转租地主土地与农民，靠剥削租子为生的，以及为地主的“庄头”、“管账”、“管事”，既有实权，且家庭生活主要靠分得地主对农民剥削来的租子过活的叫“二地主”。其无实权，亦得不到很多财粮，家庭主要靠家人劳动的，其家庭成分不能叫做“二地主”。
    ５、经过斗争后未改变成分的地主。在老区（或新区只经过初次发动的地区），有些地主经过斗争，土地所有无几，生活极大下降，但其生活仍主要的靠对农民的地租剥削来维持，不从事其他生产与劳动，仍为地主。
    ６、地主的转化。经过清算斗争，改变了地主的生产方式，靠留下来的土地自耕自食，或因分家改变其剥削地位的，或转向工商业经营的，在进入新的生产关系中，比较稳定和确定的，应以现在成分来划分，但要冠以“下降”的经营地主、富农、中农、贫农。
    这里需注意的，不能把由于公役等造成劳力缺乏的中贫农，特别是军属、干属以及孤寡出租土地的户，亦称之为地主。
    二、富农：是农村的资产阶级，一般占有多量的土地，自己家中又参加主要劳动，剥削雇佣劳动，在其全部生产收入中占较大比重，生活富裕，年有积蓄。另外也有的兼出租土地，进行地租剥削，高利贷剥削（这是富农的封建剥削部分），兼营工商业者（属于资本主义性质），皆应按具体情况划分。
    １、旧富农。在群众运动后或本人被斗后，按其生产条件，仍可能保持或扩大其雇佣经营，发展生产，但由于有顾虑或避免增资而紧缩生产，辞退雇工，到农忙季节，有的临时大量雇短工，或经过互助组雇佣劳力或利用亲戚劳力，进行生产，实质上仍是主要依靠雇佣剥削者，其成分不变。
    ２、“组织起来”集体劳动中的富农。有些富农参加互助组，专门用工资或畜力换取互助组中的劳力，而不雇佣长工，其实质是在等价交换形式掩蔽下的雇佣剥削。凡用此种剥削够三个月以上者（两季作物以四个月计），皆应划为富农。
    ３、新富农。凡农民中由于减租翻身，生产发家，必须雇用劳力，已超过全年三个月（两季作物以四个月计）以上者，皆应为富农。低者叫富裕中农。
    ４、下降富农。即是由地主、经营地主下降而来又符合前述特点者。
    ５、富农的转化。由于群众运动或其他原因，削弱其生产条件，改变了雇佣经营方式，在新的生产关系中比较稳固经常，可就现在情况划分其成分，但与其他农民有区别。
    此外，由于服公役发生劳力缺乏的中、贫农，特别是军属、干属雇佣劳动力的户，不能叫富农。
    三、中农：是农村中的小资产阶级，基本上不剥削别人，亦不受别人剥削，过着自耕自食的生活。在老解放区由于“组织起来”生产，还可以有富余，作到耕三余一。
    １、新中农。经过群众运动，土地改革，贫雇农取得了土地，和其他生产条件，初具中农条件者，应划为新中农。
    ２、不应变和应该变动的中农。凡由敌人摧残，或由于灾荒疾病的袭击，或由家人的参军、脱离生产当干部，因劳力减少而改变经营方式者，仍划为中农。有些中农，由于失掉土地和其他生产条件，短时期不能恢复，则应按现在条件，划分成分。具备富农条件，可划为新富农。
    ３、下降中农。凡由地主等降下来，又具备前述条件者，皆属之。
    ４、富裕中农。除自己劳动外，对旁人还有部分的剥削，生活富裕。
    四、贫农：是农村中的半无产阶级。土地数量少，不够维持生活，出卖劳力，或受债务剥削，生活贫苦。
    １、新贫农。由工人、雇农、赤贫获得一部分土地和其他生产条件，等于贫农者属之。
    ２、下降贫农。由地主等下降而来，其生产、生活条件如同贫农者，得划为下降贫农。
    ３、赤贫。赤贫属于贫农阶层。
    五、农村中的工人与手工业者。
    １、雇农：是农村中的无产阶级。一般全无土地与工具，或只有极少的土地与工具，完全或主要以出卖劳力维持家庭生活的（羊工、牛工在内），皆为雇农。
    ２、手工业工人：一般没有生产工具或只有简陋的工具，自己有技术，受雇于人，到处流动，出卖劳动力为生，自己不购进原料，出卖成品、或自己制造一些成品，但不占收入的主要部分，如木匠、石匠、泥水匠等都为手工业工人。
    ３、工人：一般全无土地、资本与工具，以出卖劳力为生。分矿工工人、工厂工人、产业工人、苦力工人等。
    ４、手工业者与手工业主。凡自己有生产工具，不受雇于人，自己劳动，自己购进原料，出卖成品，且为总收入中之主要部分，如一部分木匠、银匠等，应划为手工业者。凡自己具备有生产资本，经营有作坊，雇用劳力，自己亦参加主要劳动，购进原料，出卖成品，应划为手工业主，因其以剥削雇佣劳动为主，资本与经营规模较大。
    六、商人。以资本来经营商业谋得利润为生活主要来源者，皆应划为商人。在划分时，应以资本多寡、利润大小、生活程度、以及在市场上的地位，区别之。
    １、小商贩：只有少数资本，地址不固定（行商）、营业不固定者为小商贩。
    ２、小商人：占有资本不大，自贩自营，相当于贫、中农者，为小商人。
    ３、中等商人：占有相当数量资本，除自营外并雇用店员、伙计，在市场上有相当地位，相当于富农与小地主者，为中等商人。
    ４、大商人：占有大量资本雇用经理、店员，在市场上有垄断作用，为大商人，或叫商业资本家。
    七、其他成分：
    １、游民：是指长期游离于生产之外，依靠不正当职业谋生者，如乞丐、小偷、赌棍、土匪、娼妓等（按：此类游民在彻底实现土地改革后事实上已不能存在），对于带有流氓习气的不能列入。至于本人懒惰不事生产的二流子、懒汉，应以其家庭成分划分而注明为懒汉。
    ２、迷信职业者：专以宗教迷信手段为主要生活来源者，如牧师、和尚、道士、尼姑、算命的、相面的、巫婆、阴阳等皆是。其家庭不以此为主要生活者，可分别确定成分。
    ３、旧艺人：不从事生产活动，专以玩耍某种技术为生者，如唱戏、卖武、耍把戏、吹鼓手等，皆划为旧艺人。
    ４、自由职业者：包括医生、教员、记者、艺人等，皆应根据家庭出身及其与家庭的关系来区别。如主要靠此供给家庭生活者，应划为自由职业者。
    ５、荣退军人：应根据他们现在的生产条件、生产方式，具体确定。
    ６、孤寡：应了解他们的历史情况，变化过程、现在情况，分别确定，划归各个阶级中，不可与赤贫混同，或单独划一阶层。
