　　An Yang Chiang Kai-shek Officials
    Everywhere Forcibly Conscripting and Selling Soldiers
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Along the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan, the Kuomintang has recently been drastically seizing men for military service. In An Yang and other two counties alone, they plan to seize 16,000 men. In the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas of An Yang, Chiang Kai-shek's officials can sell each conscripted man for 3 million yuan. Those who are conscripted and unwilling to go must pay 2 million yuan to redeem themselves. There are many ways to conscript men. Many young men are bound and taken away under the false pretenses of being labeled "militiamen," "activists," or "connected to the Eighth Route Army." Many villages first deceive the common people by superstitious methods, organizing societies and putting names on registers, and then forcing young people to become soldiers. Now all villages have organized "gate guard soldiers," and young men aged 18 to 35 must participate. Initially, they stand guard and watch, and then they are gathered together under the pretext of being transferred to Zhangde for training, loaded onto trucks, and sent to Kaifeng and Zhangde. The puppet government's "Minsheng" newspaper also confessed without being forced, publishing an article in an important position entitled "Townships and Towns Are Abducting People for Ransom," which stated: "The Honghetun Township Office wanted fourteen conscripts, but more than fifty were seized, and they are still continuing to seize." The newspaper concluded by saying: "Even if you don't serve, you have to be ruined." Now, because Chiang Kai-shek's officials are endlessly conscripting soldiers, the people in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas of An Yang are fleeing to our liberated areas in droves.

　　安阳蒋家官员
    到处拉卖壮丁
    【本报长治讯】豫北平汉沿线，国民党近又大肆抓叮仅安阳等两县即计划抽抓一万六千名。安阳蒋占区蒋家官员，每抓丁一个能卖三百万元，被抓不愿去的须缴二百万元才能赎回，抓丁的办法很多，许多青壮年被加以“民兵”“积极分子”或“通八路”罪名捆绑而去；不少村庄先用迷信办法欺骗老百姓，组织会门，上了名册，而后迫使青年当兵。现各村均已组织“门头兵”，十八到三十五岁的青壮年都须参加，初时站岗放哨，继则集中起来借口调彰德受训，装上汽车送到开封，彰德。伪政府的“民声”报亦不打自供，以重要地位刊载“乡镇在拉肉票”一文内称：“洪河屯乡公所要十四个壮丁，然而抓了五十多个，还在继续抓。”该报结语中称：“虽不出顶，也得倾家。”现因蒋家官员兵不已，使安阳蒋占区人民纷纷逃入我解放区。
