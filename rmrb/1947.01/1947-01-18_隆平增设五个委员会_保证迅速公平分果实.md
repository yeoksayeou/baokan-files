　　[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 16th] To ensure the open, democratic, fair, and swift distribution of the fruits of victory in Longping, five additional committees have been established under the leadership of the village Peasant Associations. These committees, composed of representatives elected by each small group, are: firstly, the Fruits of Victory Clearing Committee, responsible for collecting the fruits; secondly, the Storage Committee, responsible for storage, registration, and statistics; thirdly, the Land Allocation Committee, managing land evaluation and allocation; fourthly, the Housing Allocation Committee; and fifthly, the Furniture Allocation Committee, responsible for distributing emancipation tickets and selling goods. Each committee drafts preliminary proposals, which are reviewed by the presidium of the Peasant Association and then submitted to the small groups for discussion and approval before implementation. The masses greatly welcome this approach.
