　　Brief News
    In the second district of Xiyang, the Sandu School had seven impoverished students who could not enroll at the beginning of this winter semester. After discussion by the teachers and village cadres, and considering their actual circumstances, they organized a group to carry charcoal during the day. In the morning, the group leader would lead them to school to study. In nine days, the whole group earned 3,240 yuan, which solved their families' temporary living difficulties. Now they are all attending school full-time. The whole school also formed ten groups, each with one group leader, totaling 84 people, and elected Zhang Shupen (a child) as the production committee member to lead them. They spend a certain amount of time every afternoon helping a certain factory with work. They have already earned more than 2,000 yuan, which has been praised by the families of the children in the whole village. (Wang Zhenye)
