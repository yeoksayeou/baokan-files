(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: With the arrival of 1947, the American economic crisis has become more serious, primarily manifested in the sharp decline in prices and the rising tide of wage increase strikes. Agence France-Presse reports: "The saturation of the U.S. domestic market has affected the price of certain goods, with women's clothing falling by 25%, leather goods by 30%, and agricultural products generally expected to fall by 15% to 30%." This price drop is a sign of overproduction. Soviet commentator V. Fransky wrote in Pravda that the United States will soon encounter an economic crisis. The United States is "growing a decadent and desperate atmosphere." The recent economic situation in the United States, to some extent, reminds people of the short-lived period of false prosperity after World War I. The end of that period was the economic crisis of 1921. Furthermore, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, last year, U.S. prices rose more than in any year since World War I, with wholesale market prices rising by 31%. This increase is just a flash in the pan. The aforementioned sharp price drop on New Year's Eve illustrates the reality of false prosperity. In addition, major U.S. labor unions are launching a new movement to claim "entry and exit pay." This is based on the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which stipulates that the time workers spend commuting from their homes to the factory should also be counted as work hours. Two chemical factories have already paid workers 46 million yuan, which has triggered a new wave of wage claims across the United States. The United Auto Workers of the CIO has demanded that Ford Motor Company pay 370 million yuan, and the Metal Workers Union has also asked the Federal Assembly to recover wages. It is estimated that the total amount owed by various companies is 100 billion yuan. Major U.S. labor unions are using this as part of their overall strategic plan for the wage increase movement this spring. Philip Murray, President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), stated in his New Year's Day speech calling for wage increases: Major companies can undoubtedly and forcefully increase wages because their profits are three times that of 1929. Murray pointed out that the United States is facing the threat of economic panic, and he asserted that the only way to avoid this crisis is to increase wages to increase purchasing power; but this "only way" pointed out by Murray is what capitalists are unwilling to do. On the same day as Murray's speech, a spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers (an organization of factory owners) declared that they would refuse to increase wages. In this situation, the decision made at last year's CIO annual meeting to launch a wage increase movement this spring is about to be implemented.

    生产过剩销路成问题
    美国物价开始大跌
    工人要求增资，每天进厂出厂时间，应算工钱。
    【本报综合报导】据新华社讯：跟着一九四七年的到来，美国经济危机更加严重，首先表现在物价开始大跌和要求增资工潮的高涨。据法新闻社称：“美国国内市场的饱和程度，已影响到若干货物价格正在下跌，女装衣服已跌百分之二十五，皮货下跌百分之三十，农产品将普遍跌价百分之十五至三十。”此种跌价即是生产过剩的标志。据苏联评论家佛朗斯基在真理报著文称：美国在不久的将来将遭遇经济危机。美国“正生长着颓废绝望的气氛。”最近美国的经济情势在某种程度上使人回忆到第一次世界大战后的短期的假象繁荣时期。那一时期的终点，就是一九二一年的经济危机。又据劳工部统计局宣布，去年美国物价上涨较第一次大战以来任何一年为大，批发市场价格涨百分之三十一。这种涨只是一种回光反照，上述除夕物价大跌，正是说明了假繁荣的事实。此外，美国各大工会正发动一新运动即追索“进出厂计工资”制。此为根据一九三八年公平区劳动标准所规定，工人每天从住所到厂房上班工作所必须的时间亦应计算工资。现已有两家化学工厂亦已追付工人四千六百万元，因此在全美引起一新的追索工资运动。产联之汽车工人联合会已要求福特公司补付三万七千万元，五金工会亦向联邦议院要求追索工资。据估计各公司所欠此次款额共达十万万元。美国各大工会则以此为今年春天增资运动的整个战略计划之一部。美国产业工会联合会主席莫莱于元旦演说要求增加工资中称：各大公司毫无问题的有力提高工资，因他们的利润等于一九二九年的三倍。莫氏指出美国正面临经济恐慌的威胁，他断言避免此一危机的唯一方法，是增加薪资，以提高购买力；但莫莱所指出的这一“唯一方法是资本家所不愿意做的。在莫莱演说的同日；美全国制造业协会（各工厂老板组织）发言人即声言拒绝增加工资。在此情形下，产联去年年会中关于今春发动增资运动的决定，即将付诸实施。
