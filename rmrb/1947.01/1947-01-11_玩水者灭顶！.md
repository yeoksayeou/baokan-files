　　Water Player Drowns!
　　Chiang Kai-shek's military offensive, after half a year of resolute and heavy blows by the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, is destined to fail. At this time of utter despair, instead of repenting, he is acting perversely, attempting to use the water of the Yellow River to save his dying fate. Starting from December 27th of last year, the Chiang government began to block the existing Yellow River at the Huayuankou breach, diverting the Yellow River into its old course, attempting to take advantage of the old Yellow River embankments, which have been dilapidated for eight years, to allow the Yellow River to overflow freely, turning the vast Liberated Areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan into a watery land. Now the water head has passed the Xinbian Railway, and it is evident that the lives and property of millions of compatriots will soon be buried in the belly of the fish. How vicious and cruel is Chiang Kai-shek! Since the rape case of a female student from Peking University by an American soldier last month, he has been so considerate and filial to the American troops who have insulted our nation and killed our compatriots, but he does not hesitate to release the Yellow River to submerge the lives and property of his own people. Can Chiang Kai-shek's government still be considered a "Chinese government," and can Chiang Kai-shek still be considered a "Chinese"?
　　Nine years ago, the Yellow River changed its course, flowing into the Yangtze River via the Huai River and the Grand Canal, causing more than six million disaster victims in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The flooded area covered more than 29,000 square kilometers, and the affected cultivated land was more than 17 million mu. Now the Chiang Kai-shek government wants to use the excuse of "relieving" the "disaster victims" it created nine years ago to cover up its creation of an even greater disaster. This cannot deceive anyone. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberated Area government and the people have not opposed the Yellow River returning to its old course to restore the flood-stricken areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Therefore, representatives were sent several times last year to Kaifeng, Nanjing, and Shanghai to negotiate with the Chiang Kai-shek government, UNRRA, and CNRRA regarding the agreement on the Yellow River returning to its old course, stipulating that the Huayuankou breach would only be blocked and water released into the old course after the embankment restoration and other work on the old Yellow River course was completed, and the people residing in the riverbed were relocated. In terms of funding, it was stipulated at the time that the Chiang Kai-shek government would be responsible for 66 billion yuan for engineering costs and 15 billion yuan for the relief of riverbed residents. Since the start of construction, the Liberated Areas have worked hard to restore the embankments, and the results have been remarkable. Although directly affected by the civil war, they have still been able to complete four-fifths of the embankment restoration project. However, the Chiang government violated the agreement, neglecting the embankment restoration project on the one hand and withholding funds on the other. Only 6 billion yuan was paid for engineering costs, and no relief funds were given, so many important projects could not be carried out, and riverbed residents could not be relocated. Last autumn, when the Chiang army attacked Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, it had prepared to block the breach and release water, but Zhou Enlai personally went to Kaifeng to strongly argue against it, which delayed it until this spring. Now, disregarding everything, it has blatantly implemented the blocking of the breach and the release of water. It can be said that it has reached the extreme of being untrustworthy! The person in charge of CNRRA, which is controlled by the Chiang government, made a statement after the water was released, saying: "The government had already allocated the first installment of the riverbed relief fund to this office for storage," and also said: "If no new problems arise, the funds can be distributed within days" (Central News Agency). The water has been released, and thousands of millions of people are about to be swallowed by the Yellow River, but the "relief fund" is still in the hands of CNRRA. May I ask what is being "relieved"? And to whom is it being "distributed"?
　　Mostshamelessly, Chiang Kai-shek, while deliberately releasing water, is also secretly guilty and attempting to deny it. At first, the Central News Agency repeatedly confessed to blocking the breach and releasing water, but when the broad masses of people opposed it, it immediately changed its tune and dared not admit that it had released water, but said that "the upstream water level had risen" and that the embankments of the old course "were washed away by the water flow" (Central News Agency). We solemnly warn Chiang Kai-shek: sophistry cannot cover up crimes. As the old saying goes: Those who play with fire will be burned, and those who play with water will inevitably drown! Didn't Hitler also happily play with water in the Netherlands? And the Yellow River will certainly not give the Chinese dictator and traitor any better ending than Hitler!
　　We urgently appeal to democratic people all over the world and in China to uphold humanity and stop Chiang Kai-shek's heinous crime. In particular, UNRRA should assume its own responsibilities and immediately stop it; otherwise, it should withdraw all its supplies to Chiang Kai-shek's side. Our military and civilians in the Liberated Areas should resolutely use effective actions to smash Chiang Kai-shek's heinous conspiracy.

　　玩水者灭顶！
    蒋介石的军事进攻，经过解放区军民半年来坚决而沉重的打击，败局已定。在这样日暮途穷的时候，他非但不知悔过，反而倒行逆施，竟欲用黄河之水以挽救其垂败的命运。从去年十二月二十七日起，蒋政府已开始将现黄河在花园口堵口，引黄河入故道，想利用旧黄河堤防八年来早已破烂，以便黄河自由泛滥，使冀鲁豫广大解放区成为泽国。现水头已过新汴铁路，眼看数百万同胞的生命财产即将葬身鱼腹，好毒辣好残忍的蒋介石！从上月北京大学某女生被美军奸污案发生后，他对侮辱我民族、残杀我同胞的美国军队就那样体贴孝顺，而对于本国人民却不惜放黄河之水淹没其生命财产，蒋介石这个政府还能算“中国政府”，蒋介石还能算“中国人”吗？
    九年前，黄河改道由淮河经运河入长江，曾使豫皖苏三省造成六百余万灾民，被淹地区计二万九千余平方公里，受害耕地一千七百余万亩。现在蒋介石政府又想以“救济”其九年前所造的“灾民”为借口，以掩盖其制造更大的灾难，这是骗不了任何人的。自抗战胜利后，解放区政府与人民并不反对黄河归回故道，以恢复豫皖苏受水灾地区，故去年曾几度派代表在开封、南京、上海与蒋介石政府及联总、行总商定关于黄河归故的协议，规定必须候黄河故道之复堤等工作完毕，及河床内居住人民迁出后，始在花园口堵口放水入故道。经费方面，当时规定蒋介石政府担任工程费六百六十亿元，救济河床居民费一百五十亿元。开工以来，解放区复堤工程已努力进行，成效卓著，虽受内战直接影响，仍能完成复堤工程五分之四。但蒋政府违反协议，一面对复堤工程怠工，一面扣发经费，工程费只交付六十亿，救济费分文未给，故许多重要工程无法进行，河床居民亦无法迁出。去年秋季，蒋军进攻冀鲁豫时，即曾准备进行堵口放水，经周恩来将军亲赴开封加以力争，始拖延至今春；现竟不顾一切，悍然实行堵口放水，人而无信，可谓已达极点！蒋政府把持的行总负责人在已行放水之后，却发表谈话说：“河床救济费，政府已将第一期款项早经拨交本署贮收”，又说：“如无新问题发生，日内即可发放款项”（中央社）。水都放了，千百万人快要被黄水吞没了，而“救济费”却还在行总手里，请问还“救济”什么呢？还“发放”给谁呢？
    最无耻的，蒋介石既蓄意放水，一面却又作贼心虚，妄图抵赖。中央社最初对于堵口放水一再直供，但当广大人民群众反对时，就立刻改口不敢承认自己放水，而说是“上游水位高涨”，故道之堤“系被水流冲开”（中央社）。我们正告蒋介石：狡辩掩盖不住罪行，古话说得好：玩火者自焚，玩水者亦必然自遭灭顶！希特勒不也曾在荷兰得意地玩过水么？而黄河也决然不会给中国的独裁卖国者以任何比希特勒更好看的归宿的！
    我们向全世界、全中国的民主人士紧急呼吁主持人道，阻止蒋介石这一滔天罪行，特别是联总应该负起其自身应负的责任，立加制止；否则便撤还其对蒋方的一切供应。我们解放区军民，则应当坚决的用有效行动来粉碎蒋介石这一的万恶阴谋。
