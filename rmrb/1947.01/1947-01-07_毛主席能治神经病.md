    Chairman Mao Can Cure Mental Illness
    In the Yan'an Central Hospital, there lived such a loyal and devoted comrade. He was originally a regimental-level cadre in our army. After years of hard work, he fell ill due to overwork and suffered from a very serious brain disease – mental disorder.
    Although he was recuperating, he couldn't put his mind at ease, always thinking about his troops, dreaming of fighting the enemy. He would often jump up, as if facing the enemy charging into battle, running and shouting, "Fight... Kill..." Initially, the doctors and nurses were anxious and helpless.
    Later, a comrade happened to say to him, "It's not good for your health to act like this. Many comrades in the Party Central Committee feel very sad for you. Chairman Mao has told us to ask you to listen to us."
    Hearing this, he followed the nurse back to the ward, no longer thinking about anything, and sleep replaced the chaotic thoughts. Afterward, the comrades grasped this pattern. Whenever his illness flared up, the nurses would use the same words to comfort him:
    "Good comrade, listen to us and calm down! This is Chairman Mao's decision."
    His reply was always a repetition of similar sentences: "Okay, okay. I am a Communist Party member, and I absolutely obey the interests of the Party. I listen to your advice, and I must obey Chairman Mao's decision."
    After a period of time, he recovered from his illness. He was very grateful to the Party Central Committee. He went to see Chairman Mao, as if seeing long-lost parents, and tears of joy streamed down his face. "Chairman Mao, do you know that I listened to your words in the hospital? Otherwise, I wouldn't be here," he said.
    "I believe you will listen to me, just as you believe them. Return to your fighting work post! Party spirit is forever the power of all our Party's actions," Chairman Mao said, warmly shaking his hand.

    毛主席能治神经病
    在延安中央医院里，住过这样一位忠心耿耿的好同志，他原来是我们军队里的团级干部，长年奋斗因劳致疾，患了很严重的脑病——神经错乱。
    他虽然在休养期间，但心里总是放不下去，想念着自己的部队，梦里还作着对敌斗争的事情，常常弄不好就跳起来，好像面临着敌人冲锋陷阵的样子，奔跑、喊叫：“打………杀………”最初，医生和护士们，谁也对他干急没有办法。
    后来，偶然有同志对他说：“你这样作对自己的身体是不好的。党中央许多同志为了你，心里都很难过，毛主席已告诉过我们，要你好好听我们的话。”
    他听了这话，随从着护士回到病房，不再想什么，睡眠代替了混乱的念头。之后，同志们摸住了这个规律，每逢他的病犯了，护士们就拿同样的话来安慰他：
    “好同志咧，听我们的话，安静下来吧！这是毛主席的决定。”
    他的回答，总是重复着一类的句子：“好，好。我是一个共产党员，绝对服从党的利益，我听从你们的劝告，我一定要服从毛主席的决定。”
    经过了一个时期，他的病好了。他非常感谢党中央，他跑去见毛主席，好像一旦见了久别的父母，高兴的流出泪来，“毛主席，你知道我在医院里听了你的话吧？不然，我不会到这里来。”他说。
    “我相信你会听我的话，就像你相信他们的话一样。回到战斗的工作岗位上去吧！党性永远是我党一切行动的力量。”毛主席热烈的握着他的手。
