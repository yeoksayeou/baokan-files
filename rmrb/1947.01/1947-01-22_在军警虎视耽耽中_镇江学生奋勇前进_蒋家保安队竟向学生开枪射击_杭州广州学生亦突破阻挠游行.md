Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to the Shanghai News, Zhenjiang: On the 5th, students in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, were subjected to armed suppression by the security team during a march. The march was decided by the "Joint Committee of Zhenjiang Secondary and Higher Education Schools Protesting Against U.S. Military Atrocities," which was composed of representatives from eleven major middle schools and universities, including the National Jiangsu Medical College, Zhenjiang Middle School, Jingjiang Middle School, Xin Su Middle School, and Chongshi Middle School. On the morning of the 5th, as the team of over 400 people, including professors, staff, and students from the Medical College and Nursing School, walked out of the school gate, they were blocked by fully armed security team soldiers. The large team stopped at the intersection, singing songs such as "Protest Against U.S. Military Atrocities" and "Endurance Has Reached Its Limit," and shouting slogans. The security team immediately set up six light and heavy machine guns in front, behind, left, and right of the Medical College team, and the soldiers were ordered to prepare for a charge. The security team captain claimed: "If you shout slogans again, you reactionary elements will be shot immediately!" But the students were not intimidated by them and remained very calm, posting slogans nearby. The security team captain then ordered his soldiers to tear them down. At this time, the student representatives who had been sent to negotiate with the Security Corps Headquarters returned. The students cheered and rushed to greet them, but the security team captain opened fire on the students. Fortunately, everyone immediately dispersed and was not hit. The Medical College team stood in the cold wind for four hours, without a single person giving in, and finally started the march at 12:30, hungry. The Zhenjiang Middle School team also rushed to participate, and the Chongshi Girls' Middle School and Suzhou Middle School teams also gathered, but they failed to make contact with the Medical College team due to military police obstruction. The marching team advanced proudly amidst the intimidation of military police, posting huge wall newspapers and shouting slogans, which moved all the citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to the Shanghai News, Hangzhou: More than 2,500 students from major middle schools in Hangzhou held a march on the afternoon of the 1st. Preparations for the march had been subjected to various forms of sabotage by the Kuomintang authorities. During a student meeting at Zhejiang University on the 31st, the school authorities issued a written opinion asking students not to take action, which was unanimously rejected by the students. The declaration printed by the Hangzhou City Schools' Representative Committee Protesting U.S. Military Atrocities was snatched by two secret agents. The president of the "Dangjin Publishing House," which printed the declaration, was summoned, and the declaration had to be mimeographed instead. Many school authorities prohibited students from participating in the march, but most of them still ran out to participate. They all refused to participate in the "Constitution Celebration Conference" and went to the march instead. The march received sympathy from all walks of life. Discharged soldiers, vendors, and rickshaw pullers all shouted in unison against the U.S. military bullying the Chinese people. Many young men followed the team, clenching their fists and shouting loudly.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to the Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th: More than 3,000 male and female students in Guangzhou held a demonstration march on the afternoon of the 7th. Most of the students came from Zhongshan University, and the school buildings were covered with slogans, mostly condemning the United States and criticizing the Kuomintang. Although government troops and police took precautions, the marching students were still able to pass through the Shamian U.S. Consulate and the U.S. military barracks, shouting the slogan "U.S. Troops Withdraw."

　　在军警虎视耽耽中
    镇江学生奋勇前进
    蒋家保安队竟向学生开枪射击
    杭州广州学生亦突破阻挠游行
    【新华社延安廿日电】据沪报载，镇江讯：江苏省镇江学生五日游行时遭保安队武力镇压。游行系由镇江中等以上学校“抗议美军暴行联合会委员会”所决定，该会为国立江苏医学院、镇中、京江、新苏、崇实等十一大中学校代表所组成。五日晨当医学院和护士学校包括教授职员和学生四百余人队伍走出校门时，即被一些全副武装的保安队士兵挡住，大队即停在马路口，高唱“抗议美军暴行”及“忍受已到最大限度”等歌，并呼口号。保安队立即在医学院队伍前后左右架设轻重机关枪六挺，士兵奉令作冲锋准备；保安队长声称：“再呼口号立即把你们这些反动分子枪毙！”但同学们毫未被他们吓住，依然很镇静地在附近贴标语；保安队长则令其士兵加以撕毁。此时派去保安总队部交涉的学生代表归来，同学们欢呼并奔往迎接，而保安队长竟向同学们开枪射击，幸大家立即散开，未中弹。医学院的队伍在冷风中站了四小时，没有一个屈服，终于在十二点半钟饿着肚子，开始了游行。镇江中学队伍也赶来参加，崇实女中和苏州中学等学校的队伍也集合起来，只是因军警阻挠，未能与医学院队伍取得联络。游行队伍在军警虎视耽耽中傲然前进，张贴巨幅壁报，高呼口号，市民无不动容。
    【新华社延安二十日电】据沪报杭州讯：杭州各大中学学生二千五百余人，于一日下午举行游行。游行准备工作曾遭受国民党当局各种破坏；浙大三十一日学生大会中，校方以书面意见要学生不采取行动，遭同学一致否决。杭市各校抗议美军暴行代表会所印宣言，为两特务抢去；承印该宣言之“当今出版社”社长被传讯，宣言只好改油印。许多学校当局禁止学生参加游行，但其中大部分学生仍奔出参加，他们都拒绝参加“宪法庆祝大会”，而跑去游行。游行受到各界人士的同情，退伍军人、小贩、车夫、都同声高呼反对美军欺负中国人，许多年轻小伙子跟着队伍，捏紧了拳头高声呼喊。
    【新华社延安二十日电】据中央社广州七日电，广州男女学生三千余人七日下午举行示威游行，学生多数来自中山大学，该校房屋遍贴标语，语多谴责美国及批评国民党。政府军警虽作防范，但游行学生仍能行经沙面美国领事馆及美军营房，高呼“美军撤退”口号。
