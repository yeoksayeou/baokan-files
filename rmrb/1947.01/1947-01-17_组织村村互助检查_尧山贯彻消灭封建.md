　　Organize Village-to-Village Mutual Inspection
    Yaoshan Implements Elimination of Feudalism
    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County on the 15th] Active elements from 45 villages in the Inner East District of Yaoshan gathered to discuss the emancipation movement. After more than a month of struggle in Inner East, 22 villages have completely eliminated feudal forces, 19 villages have only a few remnants left, and 4 villages have not yet overthrown feudal rule. After discussion, it was decided to completely cut off the remaining vestiges of feudalism, and the backward villages should strive to complete land reform before the spring planting. It was also decided that most villages should conduct a thorough emancipation inspection, checking whether the struggle has been thorough, whether grievances have been fully aired, whether the fruits of victory have been distributed fairly, whether there has been any waste, whether anyone has not yet been emancipated, and what backward ideas remain, and whether there is a determination to follow Chairman Mao. The democratic work style and internal problems of village cadres will also be examined. Mutual inspections between villages will be organized to thoroughly eliminate feudalism.

　　组织村村互助检查
    尧山贯彻消灭封建
    【本报威县十五日电】尧山内东区四十五个村的积极分子集会研究翻身运动。内东经过一个多月的斗争，二十二个村完全消灭了封建势力，十九个村只剩下一点尾巴，四个村封建统治仍然未打垮。经过讨论，决议把封建残余的尾巴彻底割掉，落后村庄要争取春种前完成土地改革。并决定大部村庄进行翻身大检查，检查斗的彻底否？苦水倒完否？果实分的公不公？浪费了没有？还有没有没翻身的？还有那些落后思想，是不是决心跟毛主席走？并检查村干部民主作风及内部问题。组织村与村的互相检查，以求彻底消灭封建。
