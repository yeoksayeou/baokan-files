Hebei-Lubei-Henan Local Armed Forces Behind Enemy Lines
　　Proactive Attacks, Repeatedly Achieve Victories, Greatly Changing the Situation Behind Enemy Lines
　　Hebei-Lubei-Henan Daily Issues Special Editorial
　　[Our newspaper, Hebei-Lubei-Henan, 7th dispatch] The Hebei-Lubei-Henan Daily recently published an editorial titled "Salute to the Local Armed Forces Persisting Behind Enemy Lines in the Border Region," which stated in part: In December, the local armed forces in the border region, persisting in the struggle behind enemy lines, fought a series of major and minor victories. The armed forces of the Seventh Military Sub-district, at the minor cost of eight lightly wounded, annihilated two Kuomintang diehard companies in Xingfuji. The armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district ambushed Chen Suocheng, resolving a company of the diehard He’s collaborationist troops in ten minutes, with only two lightly wounded on our side. The armed forces of the Fifth Military Sub-district attacked the puppet Caoxian Fourth District Public Office, completely eliminating it in one hour. The armed forces of the Third Military Sub-district even more flexibly applied the principle of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy." West of Feng County, they annihilated the enemy's security regiment, seizing three mortars, thirty-five light and heavy machine guns, and killing or wounding over six hundred people, including the regimental commander, creating a glorious result in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. These victories have greatly changed the situation behind enemy lines; the Kuomintang army's henchmen, the "Returning Home Corps," armed agents, and puppet village and township offices have "disappeared" and been compressed into extremely small areas. This shows that the Kuomintang army has insufficient troops and cannot attend to everything, while our local armed corps behind enemy lines, like the field army, are becoming stronger and stronger, having shifted from passively coping with the enemy's "mopping-up" and "suppression" to proactively seeking opportunities to annihilate the enemy. Finally, the editorial pointed out: The coming months are a crucial juncture in the transformation of the war situation. The tasks facing us are even more arduous and heavy. We must remember Chairman Mao's words "guard against arrogance and rashness, and continue to make persistent efforts," humbly summarize experiences, closely combine with the vital interests of the masses, and extensively carry out mass guerrilla warfare.

　　冀鲁豫敌后地方武装
    主动出击屡战屡捷敌后局面大为改观
  　冀鲁豫日报特发社论
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】冀鲁豫日报顷以“向边区坚持敌后的地方武装致敬”为题发表社论，略称：十二月份边区地方武装坚持敌后斗争，打了一连串的大小胜仗。七分区武装以轻伤八名的微小代价，在兴福集歼灭蒋顽两个连。四分区武装设伏陈所城，在十分钟内解决顽何协中部一个中队，而我则仅轻伤二名。五分区武装袭击伪曹县四区公所。在一小时内，将其干脆消灭敌三分区武装，更灵活运用：“集中优势兵力消灭敌人”之原则。在丰县以西消灭敌人的保安团，缴获迫机炮三门，轻重机枪三十五挺，毙击其团长以下六百余人，创造了敌后游击战争的光辉战果。这些胜利使敌后局面大为改观，蒋军的爪牙还乡团、武装特务和伪乡镇所等，已“消声匿迹”，被压缩在极小的地区中。这说明蒋军兵力不足，顾此失彼，而我们的敌后地方兵团则和野战军一样，愈战愈强，已从被动的应付敌人“扫荡”“清剿”，转入主动的找寻机会歼灭敌人。最后社论指出：今后的几个月正是战局转变的重要关头，摆在我们面前的任务更加艰巨繁重，我们必须记住毛主席的话“戒骄戒躁再接再厉”，虚心的总结经验，密切结合群众的切身利益，广泛开展群众性游击战。
