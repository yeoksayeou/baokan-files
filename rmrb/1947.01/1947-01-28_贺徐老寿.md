    A Toast to Old Man Xu's Birthday
    Tian Han
    At the end of last year, the Shanghai CCP Liaison Office hosted a banquet to welcome Zhang Lan and celebrate the birthdays of Elders Xu Teli and Shen Junru. Mr. Tian Han composed this poem on the spot, outlining the life of Old Man Xu. Tian was a student of Xu's for three years at Changsha Normal School, which Xu ran. The line in the poem "some were abandoned by the teacher" refers to a certain party representative who became intoxicated with the pseudo "National Assembly." He was expelled by Xu for this, but Xu, pitying his talent, introduced him to Changqun Middle School. The line "a grandmother's heart" refers to an incident when Xu was the Director of Education. A female student at a certain school had a relationship with a male student and gave birth to a child while still in school. Xu did not severely punish her but instead bought things to take care of the mother and child, allowing them to survive amidst the insults of feudal society. People gave him the nickname "Grandma Xu." Other references, such as "orchestrates the music" referring to his position as Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and "Wan Tao" referring to Mr. Tao Xingzhi, are well known to everyone.
    Mao's teacher, a sage among men,
	In twenty villages, a humble scholar;
    Cut off his finger to fight for the National Assembly,
    With great ambition at thirty.
    Founded Changsha Normal School in 1911,
    Ate meat, shocking the people's will.
    First in Hualong Pond,
    Hardships he had already prepared,
    Talents emerged one after another,
    Rebuilt Letan Temple,
    The students under his tutelage at that time,
    His noble character has not declined.
    Now, feigning democracy,
    Some were abandoned by the teacher,
    At forty, he went to Europe,
    Selling themselves to seek positions and wealth!
    Competing in the arena of youth,
    Initially learning foreign languages,
    Returned to serve the motherland,
    Striving diligently, forgetting sleep;
    Alas, the peach and plum blossoms,
    The revolution was in full swing,
    A grandmother's heart,
    Three or four out of ten died;
    Angrily threw himself into the raging fire,
    His heart filled with sorrow for the times,
    Hastily entered Moscow,
    Raised the banner of the people.
    At fifty, he learned to swim,
    The wind and snow tempered his extraordinary insight;
    Increasingly felt the strength of life,
    Claimed to have gained a miraculous skill,
    At sixty, he joined the Long March,
    Did not believe there were difficult things.
    Only fighting for liberation,
    At seventy, he orchestrates the music,
    Xiang Xu and Wan Tao,
    Did not realize old age was approaching.
    Tao died, but Xu is still old,
    The twin peaks of education,
    Students all over the world,
    Still able to manage people's food,
    The extreme cold is near warmth too,
    The spring breeze blows without a quilt.
    Raising a golden cup on the sea,
    Deep snow makes the cypress stronger,
    Born in a humble, damp land,
    Together, we get drunk for the old man's birthday.

    贺徐老寿
    田汉
    去年底，上海中共联络处设宴欢迎张澜，并祝徐特立、沈钧儒二老寿。田汉先生即席作了这首诗概述徐老生平。田是徐老所办长沙师范的三载门生。诗中所说“亦有师所弃”，系指忘形于伪“国大”中的某党代表。当日曾为徐老开除，因怜其才，介绍入长群中学。又句“一片外婆心”，系因当年徐老任教育厅长时，某校一女生与男生恋爱，在校生一子，徐老不深责，反购物照料母子，使在封建社会的辱骂之中，得以存活，人们送他个外号叫“徐外婆”。他如“司鼓吹”指任中央宣传部副部长，“皖陶”指陶行知先生，都是大家晓得的了。
    懋师人中圣，
    二十村学究；
    断指争国会，
    辛亥创长师，
    始在化龙池，
    人才相继出，
    当时及门人，
    今方假民主，
    四十赴欧洲，
    角逐少年场，
    归来报祖国，
    伤哉桃李花，
    一片外婆心，
    愤然投烈火，
    仓皇入莫京，
    五十学游泳，
    愈觉生命强，
    六十参长征，
    但为解放战，
    湘徐与皖陶，
    陶死徐虽老，
    学生遍天下，
    寒极暖亦近，
    海上举金尊，
    乃产卑湿地，
    三十有大志。
    食肉惊民意。
    艰难尝已备，
    再营泐潭寺，
    高风良未坠。
    亦有师所弃，
    卖身干禄位！
    初习横文字，
    发愤忘眠睡；
    革命正火炽，
    十中死三四；
    满腹哀时泪，
    举起人民帜。
    风雪炼卓识；
    自谓得奇攻，
    不信有难事。
    七十司鼓吹，
    不知老将至。
    教育之双瑞，
    犹能兼人食，
    春风吹无被。
    雪深柏弥劲，
    共为老人醉。
