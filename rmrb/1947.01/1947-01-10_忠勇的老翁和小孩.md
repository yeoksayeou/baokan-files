    The Loyal and Brave Old Man and Child
    Yong Jin
    Before the Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army invaded Puyang County, Xue Jinghai, a member of the village farmers' association, swore to everyone, "Even if I die, I will not surrender to the Chiang bandits!" This sixty-year-old peasant had finally started living a good life with his wife after the arrival of the Eighth Route Army. He often said in the street, "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, my wife and I would have starved to death long ago."
    On the 15th, Chiang's army entered his village. He couldn't escape, so he bolted the door. When several Chiang soldiers shot at his door, he quietly stood inside the door, holding an iron shovel, waiting to fight them when they rushed in. The Chiang soldiers started cursing outside the door. Old Jinghai, unwilling to be humiliated, gritted his teeth and cursed back: "If you have the guts, come in!" "Attack! Attack!" the Chiang soldiers shouted. "If I surrender to you traitors, I wouldn't consider myself Chinese."

    Li Yongxiang from Qudian is only ten years old this year, but he actively participated in the emancipation movement. He is lively and beautiful, and sings well. On the 19th, Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army arrived there, and he was captured by two enemies holding guns. The enemies asked, "Where are your village chief and the chairman of the farmers' association?"
    "I don't know." Little Yongxiang didn't even look at them.
    "You little brat, do you know the chairman of the women's rescue association?"
    "Still don't know."
    "Lead me to find the leader of the children's corps!"
    "I still don't know!"
    "Really don't know? If you don't know, I'll beat you to death!" These two fascists were operating their machine guns, thinking they could scare this child from the liberated area.
    "Who are you trying to scare? Even if you beat me to death, I still won't know!"

    忠勇的老翁和小孩
    勇进
    当蒋家第五军未进犯濮县以前，某村农会会员薛景海就向大家宣了誓：“死了也不能向蒋贼投降”！这个六十来岁的老农民，在八路军来以后，老俩口子才过好了。他常常在街上讲：“要不是八路军，俺老俩口子早就饿死了”。
    十五号，蒋军进了他的村，他跑不出去了，就闩上大门。当几个蒋军用枪打他的大门时，他悄悄的站在门里，拿着把铁铲，等着蒋军冲进门时就和他拚。蒋军在门外骂起来了，老景海不甘受辱，也咬牙骂起来：“有种，请进来吧！”“打！打！”蒋军喊着。“我要投降你们这汉奸，我算不是中国人”。

    曲店的李永祥，今年不过十岁，就积极的参加了翻身运动，他活泼漂亮，唱歌唱的好。十九日，蒋家第五军到了那里，他被拿着枪的两个敌人抓住了。敌人问：“你们的村长和农会长啦？”
    “不知道”。小永祥看也看他们。
    “你这个小羔子，妇救会长你知道不知道？”
    “还是不知道呀”。
    “领我找儿童团长”！
    “我也不知道”！
    “真不知道吗？不知道我就要打死你！”这两个法西斯在拨动机枪，以为这就可以吓倒这个解放区的小孩子。
    “吓唬谁呀，揍死我也不知道呀！”
