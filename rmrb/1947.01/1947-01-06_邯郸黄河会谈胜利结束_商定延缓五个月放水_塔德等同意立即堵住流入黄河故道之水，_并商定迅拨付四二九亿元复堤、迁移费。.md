    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper on the 5th] The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, in order to fulfill its internal war military conspiracy, openly violated the Heze, Nanjing, and Shanghai three-party agreements on the Yellow River returning to its old course, and prematurely carried out the closing and water release, attempting to flood seven million people along the river in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. On the 28th of last month, it violated the agreement and secretly released water into the old course, making the situation along the river even more serious. To this end, the Chinese Communist Party specially dispatched General Rao Shushi, together with UNRRA North China Executive Department Representative Lan Shiying, UNRRA China Health Commissioner Burton, and invited UNRRA Water Conservancy Committee Consultant Tappin, UNRRA China Office Henan Region Representative Webster, UNRRA Northern Henan Office, and Health Medical Director Zhu Zhimin to Handan to hold a Yellow River issue conference on the 3rd. Our region was represented by General Teng Daiyuan and Vice Chairman Rong Wusheng. Before the meeting, Mr. Tappin regarded the blocking and water release as a purely engineering technical problem. General Rao Shushi solemnly pointed out: We welcome the United States to help the Chinese people manage the Yellow River and promote its benefits, but we do not agree to regard the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique's closing and water release as a purely engineering technical problem. This is a serious military and political conspiracy. UNRRA relief materials to China should be given to the Chinese people, benefiting the Chinese people, and should not help Chiang Kai-shek release water to harm the Chinese people. This will only deepen the Chinese people's hatred of the United States. If American friends cannot fairly and reasonably resolve the Yellow River issue, this is not only a violation of humanity, but also a sin from a religious point of view, which the Chinese people will never forget. At this time, Tappin turned around and said: So, what should we do? Vice Chairman Rong replied: We hope you will stand on a fair position and do things to save the Chinese people. After the meeting was started and presided over by General Teng Daiyuan, Tappin reported on the progress of the Yellow River blocking project. Then Webster spoke, saying: Tappin started from an engineering point of view, advocating water release. I started from a relief point of view, and water release should be particularly cautious, and the opinions of the people in the liberated areas must be listened to. The previously promised allocation of 15 billion yuan for relief expenses is entirely for the relocation of Yellow River residents, and does not include UNRRA general relief expenses. Subsequently, Zhao Zhengyi, the representative of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office stationed in Kaifeng Yellow River Representative Group, reported on the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique's repeated violations of the agreement and unilateral blocking and water release. Based on the spirit of the agreement, he put forward the following three minimum requirements: (1) Dyke reconstruction funds should be allocated quickly. According to the Shanghai Zhou, Chiang, and Ma agreement, the first phase of dyke reconstruction funds should be 1 million million yuan. In addition to the 600,000 million yuan already allocated, there is still a shortfall of 400,000 million yuan. However, our actual expenditure on dyke reconstruction has been 1.09 million million yuan, so another 490,000 million yuan must be supplemented. According to the Administrative Yuan's total dyke reconstruction amount for the Yellow River is 44 billion yuan, our region should receive at least 60 percent, which is 26.4 billion yuan. In addition to the 6 billion yuan already issued, another 20.4 billion yuan must be allocated. (2) Relocation fees should be issued to residents: According to the Heze and Nanjing agreements, each riverbed resident should receive 100,000 yuan in relief funds. There are more than 600,000 riverbed residents in the liberated areas. The 3.25 million million yuan allocated by the three-person committee only averages 50,000 yuan per person, and later reduced to 2.25 million million yuan, only averaging 30,000 yuan per person. The 15 billion yuan that has now been allowed to be issued should be allocated quickly. The 5 billion yuan in cash should be sent as soon as possible. The other 10 billion yuan can be used to purchase materials to carry out cooperative relief, and the remaining 7.5 billion yuan must also be supplemented as scheduled. (3) According to previous agreements, the river must be restored and the dykes repaired first, the river course straightened, and dangerous sections repaired before water can be released. However, since August last year, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has launched a large-scale offensive against our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, and used aircraft to strafe our dyke repair personnel, destroying dyke repairs, which delayed dyke repair and risk management by five months. Therefore, we demand that the closing and water release must be postponed until the end of May or the beginning of June this year. Otherwise, the people in the liberated areas will resolutely oppose it and only take self-rescue and self-defense actions. After Vice Chairman Rong spoke, the meeting entered into discussion. Tappin first believed that from an engineering point of view, it is difficult to determine a date. Blocking the Yellow River is like a doctor performing surgery, and he cannot perform surgery based on other people's opinions. Webster immediately pointed out: It is true that engineers cannot determine an exact date, but an approximate date can be determined with certainty. As for performing surgery, the doctor should also obtain the patient's consent before performing surgery. At this point, Tappin and others held a small group meeting themselves, and they agreed to implement the following three points: (1) Send engineers to investigate the river dykes immediately and allocate funds immediately. (2) First block the water flowing into the old Yellow River course so that it does not flow anymore. (3) Go to Shanghai immediately to allocate funds and discuss the engineering plan with Major General Egger. Finally, Webster also suggested convening a supreme authority meeting in Shanghai to resolutely implement all resolutions. Mr. Lan Shiying suggested changing the Yellow River Committee Heze Office to a small group to facilitate the work. Finally, General Teng Daiyuan summarized the meeting's discussion. He emphasized: First, we must recognize that the Yellow River issue is not a simple engineering issue, but a serious political and military issue. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is attempting to use the Yellow River returning to its old course to flood the lives and property of our seven million people along the river. This cannot be justified even from the religious point of view of humanitarianism. Therefore, I hope that American friends and engineers will seriously recognize this point. Secondly, I agree with Vice Chairman Rong's requirements regarding the Yellow River issue. Our Communist Party has always faithfully implemented the previous agreements it has signed. We hope that the five gentlemen will also continue to work hard for the previous agreements in order to achieve them. Thirdly, the Chinese people's awareness has been unprecedentedly raised. They see very clearly that if American friends sincerely and reasonably handle the Yellow River issue and do this well, it will be a great achievement for the Chinese people, and the Chinese people are very grateful. Otherwise, if it really brings disaster to the Chinese people, they will definitely remember the handling of the Yellow River issue. American friends are not only participants, but also the moderators. The responsibility of the executioner who massacred the Chinese people still cannot be shirked. At this point, everyone agreed with our representative's opinions and believed that agreement had been reached on opinions. Mr. Tappin and others immediately stated that they would stop blocking the river tomorrow and immediately go to Zhengzhou and Shanghai to stop the blocking and urge the allocation of relocation fees. The meeting was held from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm and adjourned in a very harmonious atmosphere.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd - Chiang Kai-shek tore up the previous agreements on the Yellow River issue, disregarding the lives and property of seven million people in the liberated areas along the old Yellow River course, and has brazenly begun to divert the Yellow River into its old course at the end of last year. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Jinan on the 2nd: "The Huayuankou Yellow River blocking project is being actively carried out, and the mouth will be blocked. On the 27th of last month, the Huayuankou Blocking and Restoration Bureau diverted the river water into the diversion river, causing it to flow into the old course. The water is fierce, and it is expected to flow to Jinan around January 15th." According to the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course, the liberated areas and the Kuomintang side signed four agreements last year, including Heze and Nanjing. The steps stipulated in each agreement were to first repair the dykes, dredge the river, organize dangerous sections, and relocate residents of the old course, and then block the mouth and release water. However, the Kuomintang side unilaterally actively blocked the mouth, strafed and destroyed the people in the liberated areas who were repairing the dykes, withheld work and grain, and took the opportunity to mobilize large armies to occupy the areas north and south of the old Yellow River course. Chiang Kai-shek's brazen diversion of the Yellow River into its old course this time, his main conspiracy is clearly to save his serious military defeat in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated areas.

    邯郸黄河会谈胜利结束
    商定延缓五个月放水
    塔德等同意立即堵住流入黄河故道之水，并商定迅拨付四二九亿元复堤、迁移费。
    【本报五日特讯】蒋介石反动集团为遂其内战军事阴谋，竟公开违背荷泽、南京、上海三次黄河归故协议，提前进行合龙放水，以图淹没我冀鲁豫沿河七百万人民。上月二十八日，即违背协议、秘密放水流入故道，致沿河情势益为严重。为此，中共特派饶漱石将军，会同联总驻北平执行部代表蓝士英、联总驻华卫生专员卜敦，并邀联总水利委员会顾问塔德、联总驻华办事处河南区代表韦士得、联总豫北办事处、卫生医务主任朱治民前来邯郸，于三日举行黄河问题会议，我区则由滕代远将军、戎伍胜副主席代表参加。会议前，塔德先生曾把堵口放水视为单纯的工程技术问题。饶漱石将军乃慎重指出：我们欢迎美国帮助中国人民治黄兴利，但我们不赞成把蒋介石反动集团的合龙放水看成是单纯的工程技术问题，这是一个严重的军事政治阴谋。联总救济中国的物资，应当施予中国人民，造福中国人民，而不应帮助蒋介石放水残害中国人民，这样只会加深中国人民对美国的仇恨。如果美国朋友对黄河问题不能公平合理的解决，这不仅违背人道，即从宗教观点上来讲，也是一种罪恶，这是中国人民永远不会忘记的。此时塔德乃转而表示：那么，我们应做些什么呢？戎副主席答道：希望你们站在公正的立场，做救中国人民的事情。会谈由滕代远将军主持开始后，即由塔德报告黄河堵口工程经过。接着韦士得发言，他说：塔德是从工程观点出发，主张放水，我从救济观点出发，放水应特别慎重，并须听取解放区人民意见，过去所允拨救济费用一百五十亿元，完全是黄河居民迁移的费用，是不包括联总一般救济费在内的。继由我冀鲁豫行署驻开封黄河代表团代表赵政一报告蒋介石反动集团历次破坏协议及片面堵口放水经过之后，根据协议精神，提出最低三项要求：（一）应迅速拨发复堤费。根据上海周、蒋、马协议，第一期复堤费应发一百万万元，除已拨六十万万元外，尚差四十万万元，但我们复堤已实际开支一百零九万万元，故还须补发四十九万万元，根据行总关于黄河全部复堤款额共为四四○亿元，我区最低应分百分之六十，即二百六十四亿，除已发六十亿外，还须再拨给二百零四亿。（二）发给居民迁移费：根据荷泽、南京协议，每个河床居民应领救济费十万元，解放区河床居民共有六十多万人，三人委员会决定拨发的三百二十五万万元，平均每人只能分得五万元，以后又减为二百二十五万万元，每人只能平均三万元，现在已允许发给的一百五十亿元，应迅速拨付。五十亿现款应尽速发来。其他一百亿元，可购买物资办理合作救济，下剩七十五亿元，亦须照数补发。（三）根据历次协议，必须先复河修堤，裁湾取直，修好险工后，始能放水。但自去年八月以后，蒋介石反动集团，即大规模向我冀鲁豫进攻，并用飞机扫射我复堤人员，破坏修堤，致复堤修险推延五月，因此我们要求合龙放水必须推迟到今年五月底或六月初，否则解放区人民，将坚决反对，只有采取自救自卫行动。戎副主席发言后，会议即进入讨论，塔德首先认为：从工程观点说，很难确定日期，黄河堵口犹如医生施行手术，他不能根据旁人意见去施行手术。韦士得当即指出：工程师固不可能确定一确切日期，但大致日期是有把握确定的，就以施行手术来说，医生也应征得病人的同意才能进行开刀。至此，塔德等乃自行举行小组会，他们同意实行下列三点：（一）即日派工程师前往调查河堤，并即刻拨款。（二）即先将流入黄河故道之水堵住，不让再流。（三）到上海立刻拨款，并与艾格森少将商谈工程计划。最后，韦士得还建议在上海召集最高权力会议以求坚决执行一切决议。蓝士英先生建议把黄委会荷泽办事处改为小组，便于进行工作。最后滕代远将军总结会议讨论，他着重指出：第一、必须认识黄河问题，不是一个单纯的工程问题，而是一个严重的政治军事问题，蒋介石反动集团是企图利用黄河归故来淹没我沿河七百万人民的生命财产，这单从宗教的仁道主义上着想，也是无法讲通的，因此，希望美国朋友和各位工程师，要严重认识这点。其次，我同意戎副主席关于黄河问题的要求，我们共产党对他签订的历次协议，历来是忠实执行的，我们希望五位先生亦应为历次协定继续努力，以求实现。第三、中国人民的觉悟已空前的提高了，他们看得很清楚，美国朋友要是真诚合理的处理黄河问题，把这件事情作好了，那是对中国人民很大的功绩，中国人民是非常感激的。不然，若真正把灾害带给中国人民，他们一定会记得黄河问题的处理，美国朋友不但是参加者，而且是主持者，屠杀中国人民的刽子手的责任仍是不能推脱的。至此，大家同意我方代表的意见，并认为意见上已经取得一致。塔德等先生并当即表示，明天即停止堵口，并立即分赴郑州、上海进行停堵和催促拨给迁移费诸工作。会议上午十一时开至下午四时，在极为和谐的气氛中散会。
    【新华社延安三日电】蒋介石撕毁历次黄河问题协议，弃沿黄河故道解放区七百万人民生命财产于不顾，已悍然于去年底开始将黄河导入故道。据中央社济南二日电报导：“花园口黄河堵口工程刻正积极进行，口门将被堵塞。上月二十七日，花园口堵复局将河水导入引河，使流入故道，水势猛烈，约于一月十五日可流济南。”按黄河归故问题，解放区与国民党方面于去年间曾签订荷泽、南京等四次协议，历次协议规定步骤均为先修堤浚河、整理险工、迁移故道居民，然后堵口放水。而国民党方面则单方面积极堵口，扫射摧残解放区复堤人民，扣发工粮工款，并乘机调动大军进占黄河南北故道地区。此次蒋介石悍然导黄入故，其主要阴谋显在挽救其在冀鲁豫解放区之严重军事败绩。
