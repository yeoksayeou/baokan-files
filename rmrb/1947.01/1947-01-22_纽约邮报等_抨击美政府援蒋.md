    Criticize U.S. Government Aid to Chiang Kai-shek
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Moscow Broadcasting: Some American newspapers have severely criticized the U.S. military authorities stationed in China for causing great damage to the Chinese people. The New York Post's Shanghai correspondent reported that the American representatives in China have failed to recognize the true nature of the Chinese events, which is a struggle between feudal autocracy and progress. The New York Herald Tribune protested against the aid from American reactionaries, stating, "Americans, whether in China or other countries around the world, should support democracy, and not support the remnants of corrupt feudal autocracy."
