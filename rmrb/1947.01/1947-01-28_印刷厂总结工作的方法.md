    Printing Factory's Method of Summarizing Work
    Wang Hua
    I often see people gathering materials from all over when making summaries, then synthesizing them, and summarizing them into several problems or a number of points. The time is also often after a central task is completed. Of course, I also learn this method. Experience shows that such summaries, when reported at meetings, often result in listeners joking, dozing off, and making dissatisfied remarks afterwards. The main reasons for this phenomenon are the following three shortcomings: First, because one person's strength is limited, it is impossible to collect materials from all angles, and the conclusions are prone to be one-sided. Often, one or two points are seized as examples to illustrate a problem, making it impossible for people to deny it, but they are not convinced or cannot be convinced in their hearts. Second, because of one person doing everything from beginning to end, it is easy to delay, and it often becomes historical material with little current practical educational significance. Third, it is easy to start from the summarizer's own understanding and personal preferences (hobbies), and others do not like to listen to this.
    Our factory (Yongxing Printing Factory) changed this method in actual work after launching the Support the Frontline Movement on October 1st last year. When the movement had been going on for a month, each department (note) first held a review meeting to check the achievements and shortcomings of the past month based on the individual plans made by each person for "supporting the movement." First, the person himself reported, and then others supplemented, and the materials of each person were summarized to become the summary of each department. Then, it was taken to the enlarged Party and Administration-Trade Union meeting (which is the highest organization in the factory, including: branch secretary, trade union executive committee members, and heads of administrative departments) for mutual inspection between departments, especially the second production process inspecting the first production process, which can find many problems. For example, the type casting department said in its summary how much the output has been increased and the quality has also been improved. The typesetting department, which uses the type, immediately pointed out how many characters have not been polished and how many lead lines are uneven, thus correcting the summary of the type casting department. The summaries of each department passed by the enlarged Party and Administration-Trade Union meeting are then synthesized to become the summary of the entire factory. Such summaries are very trivial. Procedures, such as saying that Comrade ×× did not go to the theater on his day off to study typesetting, and ×× cut his finger due to hard work. The engraving department collected the lead powder engraved from the lead characters, which used to be blown away casually. The type casting department implemented personal registration, which made everyone work harder. But when I gave a report to everyone, which lasted for more than an hour, there were no jokes, dozing off, or frequent trips to the toilet to drink water, which were common in previous meetings. Everyone listened quietly, and there were no dissatisfied remarks afterwards. Moreover, each department held another review meeting based on the summary. The typesetting department proposed a guarantee: to start work before the work bell rings. "Eliminate sarcastic remarks and attacks on people." Someone in the type casting department proposed, "If I am found to have cast characters that do not meet the quality standards in the future, my grade will be lowered." The backward plate-making department devoted itself to catching up and leaped to become an advanced department. From then on, it embarked on a "hot and lively" mass movement. The task of finishing the book "The Four Big Families of China" in five days was estimated to be impossible, but it was completed in three and a half days. At the end of the second month, a summary was made again according to the method of the first month. The report at the meeting lasted for two and a half hours, and everyone listened intently, which was a rare phenomenon.
    I think the reason why this summary can play such a big role is first of all because it truly achieved everyone doing everyone's summary, and it completely respected the opinions of the masses, and passed through the mass line of everyone (publicly recognized). This is a mass summary method; because of the mass nature of this method, the content is not about high-level things or principles that non-masses can understand, but are the achievements, new creations, and the masses' own criticisms and mutual opinions of the workers (masses); therefore, the characteristics of this summary are honesty and concreteness, such as saying that ×× person works hard and does heavy work, and often sweats on his forehead. In order to prevent problems in the work, he puts a bowl of rice and takes it to the workshop to eat while taking care of it. The typesetting department established a workers' meeting and received some achievements. These are all publicly recognized by the masses after repeated discussions, and are the news of our factory, which can be understood and enjoyed by everyone. Without obliterating a little bit of merit, making people feel that they have not worked in vain, this becomes a good encouragement. At the same time, without exaggerating, it also points out the shortcomings, which can make people convinced, so it does not have a counterproductive effect. Many specific materials have become a way to introduce the new experiences created by the masses themselves, encourage progress in actual work, and point out future struggles.
    [Note] Our factory's organizational system is - the factory department, under which there are the type casting department, the typesetting department, the plate-making department, the engraving department... The department is a unit organization for a production process.

    印刷厂总结工作的方法
    王华
    常看见有人作总结时先到处搜集材料，然后综合起来，归纳成几个问题或若干点，时间也往往在一个中心工作完结以后，我当然也学习着这种方法。经验证明，像这样的总结，在大会上报告时，听者开玩笑，打瞌睡，会后说二话，表示不满等大有人在。所以产生这种现象，主要由于下列三个毛病：第一，因为一个人的力量有限，不能从各个角度上搜集材料，结论易于片面，往往抓着一二点作为例子，说明一个问题，使人听了否定不了，但内心不以为然或不能服气；第二，由于独自一个人的从头至尾做起，忙不过来，易于拖延，往往成为没有多大当前实际教育意义的历史材料；第三，易从总结工作者自己的认识及个人胃口（爱好）出发，别人不爱听这一套。
    我们工厂（永兴印刷厂）自去年十月一日开始发动支援前线运动后，在实际工作中改变这种方法。当运动进行了一个月后，就首先由各部（注）开检讨会，根据各人为“支运”所订的个人计划检查一个月来的成绩和缺点，先由本人报告，然后别人补充，把每个人的材料总结起来，就成为各部的总结。再拿到扩大的党政工会议上（是工厂的最高组织，包括：支书、工会执委、行政各部负责人）进行部与部间的相互检查，特别是第二个生产过程检查第一个生产过程，能发现很多问题。如铸字部总结上说产量提高多少，质量也有改进，用字的排字部马上提出有多少字没有磨光，有多少铅线高低不一，修正了铸字部的总结。把经过扩大党政工会议通过的各部总结，综合起来，就成了全厂总结。像这样的总结，非常琐碎，手续，如说××同志休息日不去看戏学习排字，××又因努力工作切坏了手指头，刻字部把从铅字上刻下来的铅沫都积起来，从前顺口一吹就都飞了。铸字部实行个人登记，因而使大家工作紧张起来。但当我向大家作报告时，历时一点多钟，却没有像往日里开大会必有的开玩笑，打瞌睡，往来如织的大小便喝开水等现象，大家静静的听着，会后也不说二话。且各部都根据总结又开了一个检讨会，排字部提出保证：不打上工钟就上工。“消灭说讽刺话打击人”，铸字部有人提出“今后如再发现我铸的字不合质量标准就下我的等级”。落后的打版部就埋头追赶，一跃成为先进部。从此走上“热火朝天”的群众运动。《中国四大家族》一书五天都估计完不成的任务，三天半就告结束。到了第二个月底，照第一个月的方法，又作了总结，在大会报告达两点半之久，大家都是聚精会神的静听，这是少有的现象。
    这个总结所以能起这样大的作用，我认为首先由于真正作到了全体人员大家做大家总结，且完全是特别尊重群众意见，通过大家（公认）的群众路线。这是一种群众性的总结方法；由于这个方法的群众性，内容也就不是谈什么非群众所能理解的高级东西，原则问题，而都是工人们（群众）自己的成绩，新创造以及群众自己的批评与相互意见；因此，这种总结的特点是老老实实，都是具体事例，如说××人工作挑重活作，额上经常流汗，为了怕工作中出乱子，盛了一碗饭就端到工作房里边吃边照顾。排字部成立了工人会议收到了什么成绩。这些，都是群众反复讨论后公认，又是本厂的新闻，能为大家听得懂且乐闻愿晓。不抹煞一点优点，使人感到没有白出力，这就成了很好的鼓励。同时，不夸大，也指出缺点，能使人服气，因而不起反作用，许多具体材料，变成了介绍群众自己创造的新经验，鼓励在实际工作中前进与指出今后奋斗的一种方法。
    【注】我们工厂的组织系统是——厂部，下设铸字部，排字部，打版部，刻字部………部为一个生产过程的单位组织。
