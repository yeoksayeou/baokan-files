    People's Gunners at the Front
    Fang De
    Chiang Kai-shek, the lackey of American imperialism, not only sent heavy artillery to the people's army but also "well-trained" artillerymen. On the training grounds, they expertly loaded and unloaded American guns. On the battlefields, they aimed and fired with surprising accuracy, causing each newly liberated Chiang army artilleryman to constantly ask the previously liberated Chiang army artillerymen: "Hey! There must be Russian gunners in the Eighth Route Army, using Russian steel guns to hit us. Otherwise, how could they hit so accurately and powerfully?" "If there aren't any Russians, then there must be Japanese gunners." No matter how the earlier liberated fighters explained, the newly liberated soldiers always thought, "You guys have been here longer and become 'Eighth Route-ized.' Who would believe that nonsense!" These newly liberated soldiers only believed the explanations were true after personally participating in battle.
    The reporter once visited the artillery fourth company commander of a certain unit at the front. He told me, "This company only had fifty people when it went to the self-defense front. Now, it has been reinforced with × hundred men. In addition to a small number of new fighters from the liberated areas, Chiang Kai-shek has supplied us with more than × ten artillerymen. The guns have also been completely replaced with American ones, and the shells came with the guns." He also told me a story about a newly liberated fighter fighting alongside an old fighter: "During the battle of Zhangfengji, when we were fighting for houses with the 32nd Regiment of the 11th Division, we brought the artillery to within thirty meters of the enemy's regimental headquarters to cover the infantry's assault. We had already suppressed the enemy's fire to the point where they couldn't shoot at our position. However, there was only one shell left. Luo Shucai, a newly liberated fighter, rushed out of the position to seize two carts of enemy shells, and his left arm was injured by an enemy grenade. After the battle, the superiors told him to go to the hospital, but he said, 'If I leave, no one will take care of my squad. I'll just rest in the company.'" Then he participated in new battles.
    During the Dingcao battle, this artillery company closely followed the enemy. An artillery company of Chiang's direct line, the Third Division, was cornered and retreated in panic to Guzhai. A battalion of the 46th Regiment of the 47th Division, stationed in Guzhai, refused to let them in. By the time our infantry and artillery arrived together, the Chiang army artillery company commander had already disguised himself as a soldier and ordered the surrender of weapons.
    During the Huaxian battle, the artillerymen who were liberated in Shaoerzhai said, "Your first shot hit our artillery position, killing the company commander. The deputy company commander was also wounded, and more than a dozen brothers sacrificed in vain. The rest ran away and hid in sweet potato cellars. Our artillery company was finished without firing a single shot."
    Huo Muzhen and Zhang Huaijin said, "In Shaoerzhai, we were grabbing villagers every day to build fortifications. When we became prisoners, we saw that the ones carrying guns and escorting us were the very villagers who had built the fortifications. We then realized that the Eighth Route Army knew where we were even before the fighting started. How could they not hit accurately?"

    人民的炮手在前线
    方德
    美帝国主义的奴才蒋介石，不仅给人民的军队送来了重炮，也送来了“训练有素”的炮兵，在练兵场上那样熟练地装卸美式炮，在轰击蒋军的战场上那样出奇地瞄准射击，使每次新解放过来的蒋军炮兵，不断向前一次解放过来的蒋军炮兵发问：“喂！八路军里一定有俄国炮手，使用俄国钢机炮打我们，不然怎么会打得那样准那样厉害呢？”“如果没有俄国的，那也一定有日本的炮手。”无论先解放过来的战士怎样解释，在新解放战士们的心里总是：“你们早过来了，八路化啦，谁相信这鬼话！”这些新解放的战士直到下一次亲身参加了战斗，他们才相信这些解释是千真万确的。
    记者曾经访问过前线某部炮兵第四连连长，他告诉我说：“这个连出发到自卫前线时，才五十个人，现在已经补充×百名了，除小部分由解放区来的新战士外，蒋介石就给我们补充了×十多名炮手。炮也全换成美式的了，炮弹是随着炮一齐来的。”他还告诉我一个新被解放的战士和老战士并肩作战的故事：“打张凤集，和十一师三十二团逐屋争夺的时候把炮带到离敌人团部三十来米达的地方，掩护步兵冲锋，已经把敌人的炮火打得无力向我们阵地射击，可是炮弹只有最后一发了，新被解放过来的战士罗树才急的冲出阵地去夺取敌人的两车炮弹，被敌人的手榴弹炸伤左臂，战斗结束后，上级叫他去住医院，他说：“我走了班里没人照顾，就在连队里休养吧。”接着他又参加了新的战斗。”
    定曹之战时，这个炮兵连紧跟着敌人，蒋家嫡系第三师的一个炮兵连被追赶得没有路了，就仓惶退到古寨。驻守古寨的四十七师四十六团的一个营，闭门不纳，等到我们步炮兵一齐赶到时，蒋军炮兵连长早已化装成士兵，下令放下武器了。
    滑县之战，在邵耳砦被解放过来的炮兵说：“你们第一炮就打到我们的炮兵阵地，打死了连长，副连长也带了彩，十多个弟兄也白白牺牲了，其余的都跑了躲到红薯窖里，我们这个炮兵连一炮没打就完啦。
    霍木珍和张怀金说：“我们在邵耳砦成天抓村里老百姓作工事，等到当了俘虏的时候，看到背枪押俘虏的就是那些作工事的老百姓，才晓得八路军还没有打就早知道我们在那里了，怎么不一打就准呢？”
