    Bidi Village: From Poor to Rich, Distributing Fruits According to Need; Extreme Poverty Eliminated with Sufficient Land Allocation
    [Our Newspaper] In the Bidi Village of the Fourth District of Shimin, Taiyue, during the fruit distribution, the principles of "prioritizing the poor then the rich," "distribution according to need," and "self-reporting and public discussion" were employed, leading to the complete elimination of extreme poverty and a significant improvement in the living standards of poor peasants. The experiences are as follows: (1) In discussing fruit distribution, first, everyone's thinking was aligned, establishing the concept that "the poor must completely turn their lives around," and correcting the erroneous notion that "how much can the poor become rich all at once?" (2) In land distribution, after self-reporting, it was followed by deliberation, and all thirteen extremely poor households received sufficient land. If any poor peasants wished to relocate, they could adopt immigration exchange methods to allocate land to them elsewhere. (3) In the distribution of furniture and farm tools, priority should be given to newly settled extremely poor peasant households, breaking the perception that "getting land means no more furniture." Other furnishings, such as beds, tables, mirror screens, etc., were fairly priced to allow peasants to purchase them freely. If several families competed for an item, military dependents and retired soldiers should be given priority. Deliberations emphasized taking care of the families of martyrs, military dependents, and honored veterans, and the principle of "prioritizing the poor then the rich" according to the actual situation of the families, rather than rigidly adhering to class distinctions. Other items were sold to buy production tools or cattle and donkeys, which were then distributed uniformly to poor peasants without livestock. As a result of this distribution, all thirteen extremely poor households in the village received the necessary land, houses, grain, and furniture. For example, the extremely poor Tian Xinggao family of three received three cattle, twelve mu of land, two cave dwellings, and three shi of grain, immediately transforming them into middle peasants.

    壁底村先贫后富按需分果实
    赤贫获得足够土地
    【本报讯】太岳士敏四区壁底村在分配果实时，由于掌握了“先贫后富”“按需分配”“自报公议”的原则，使赤贫全部消灭，贫农大大上升。其经验：（一）在讨论分配果实时，首先打通每个人的思想，确定“穷人一定要翻透身”的观念，纠正“穷人一下能富成啥”的错误想法。（二）在分配土地时，经过自报后，再经过评议，十三户赤贫都获得足够的土地，如有愿意迁居的贫农，亦可采用移民兑换的办法，到别处给他分配土地。（三）在分配家具及农具时，首先要对新按家的赤贫农，特别照顾。打破“得了土地就不能再得家具”的认识。其余的陈设品，如床桌、镜屏等，均公平作价，让农民自由购买。如几家争买一件东西时，须让军属、荣退军人先买。评议中提出照顾烈属军属荣誉军人，且需要按“先贫后富”的原则，及家庭的实际情况，不要死划等级。至于其他东西，则变卖成生产工具或牛驴，统一分配给没牲畜的贫苦农民。这样分配的结果，全村十三户赤贫，均得到了所需之土地、房屋、粮食及家具。例如赤贫田兴高全家三口人，得到三个牛、十二亩地、两孔窑、三石粮食，一下即变成了中农。
