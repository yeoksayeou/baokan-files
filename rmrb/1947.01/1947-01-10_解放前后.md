    Before and After Liberation
    Wu Xiang
    In January of last year, when our Eighth Route Army liberated the four gates of Liaocheng and was launching a general offensive against the puppet Northwest Shandong Security Special Task Force Fourth Brigade entrenched in the city, the January 13th ceasefire order was announced. To demonstrate our good faith, we immediately withdrew the troops that had already scaled the city walls and occupied the bunkers. Over the past year, our democratic government and local armed forces have consistently maintained their positions in the four gates, protecting the interests of the people. A few days before the city's liberation, I, as a reporter, arrived in the East Gate and was immediately struck by the fact that although the East Gate was only separated from the city by a moat, it was a bustling and stable market. It had a population of 12,000. A democratic district government was established at the end of January last year, with Zhao Qiaomin, a native of the East Gate, as the district head. With the active support of our democratic government, commerce has become more prosperous than during the enemy's and puppets' rule. The number of larger restaurants has increased from one to four, with the best earning as much as 10,000 yuan per day. The number of general shops has doubled from the original forty, and the number of vendors has increased even more. Currently, there are over two hundred vendors who have joined the vendors' union, and the cart pullers have also organized a trade union. Mr. Pan Jinbang, who runs a silversmith shop, told the reporter that because the exorbitant taxes and levies had been abolished, his life had greatly improved. Last year, his total burden was only eight catties of rice and four hundred yuan, which was less than the taxes he had to pay in one month in the past. The residents described with great pride, gratitude, and joy how our local armed forces repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the puppet troops who came out of the city to loot grain and conscript men, and said: The Chiang Kai-shek's American-made planes from Jinan often transported ammunition and food to the puppet troops in the city, while indiscriminately bombing and strafing the residents of the four gates. The Jin Liansheng family of eight, who ran a tea house on East Main Street in the East Gate, were left with only a wounded mother and her child. The threat of air raids forced the market, originally located in Liuyuan in the East Gate, to move to another location, but when the new market began, the East Gate was still extremely lively. Each market had more than 50,000 people. When the reporter entered the city for inspection shortly after the cessation of hostilities, he saw a completely different scene: nearly one-third of the buildings in the city were destroyed. In the tall, dilapidated houses devoid of people, residents, occasionally emerged, emaciated and weak from hunger, embracing our soldiers who had entered the city, pouring out their grief of the past few years. The city originally had a population of 15,000 people. As early as when the Executive Group first came to Liaocheng, they petitioned for relief, hoping to escape this hell on earth and make a living outside the city. Our representative, Zhu Ziwei, also strongly advocated for the release of the poor masses from the city to provide them with relief, but the Chiang Kai-shek representative firmly refused to reply, resulting in a serious famine. At this time, Wang Jinxiang, Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth War Zone Commander and Shandong Sixth Special Commissioner, who had colluded with the Japanese invaders to kill the old anti-Japanese hero Fan Zhuxian and now commanded all the puppet troops in the city, openly declared: "For the sake of military operations, it doesn't matter if 30,000 or 50,000 people starve to death." As a result, more than 3,000 people in the city suffered. However, the food for Wang Jinxiang and other puppet military leaders, white flour, butter, and kelp, was sent from Jinan by American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes. After our democratic government entered the city, it immediately stabilized order, provided condolences and relief, and the refugees who had fled and hid outside the city have returned to the city one after another, rebuilding their shattered homes.

    解放前后
    吴象
    去年一月，当我八路军解放聊城四关，正向盘据城内之伪鲁西北保安特务第四旅发动总攻时，一月十三日停战令公布了。我为昭示信义，当即撤回已经登城占领碉堡之部队。一年来，我民主政府及地方武装，始终在四关坚持阵地，保护人民利益。记者于该城解放前数日，抵达东关，首先大感惊异的是，东关与城虽仅护城河一水之隔，却为一熙攘安定之市场。此处拥有一万二千人口。去年一月底已成立民主区政府，区长即东关人赵侨民。在我民主政府积极扶助下，商业较敌伪统治时期繁荣，较大的饭馆，由一家增至四家，生意最好时每日收入达一万元，一般铺原四十家现增加一倍，摊贩增加数目更多，现加入摊贩联合会的即有二百余户，排车工人也组织了工会。开银器铺的潘金榜先生告诉记者，因为废除了苛捐杂税，他生活大改善，去年一年的负担，他只出了八斤米和四百元，比过去一个月的捐税还少。居民们描述我地方武装屡次痛击出城抢粮抓丁的伪军，流露着极大的骄傲、感激和喜悦，并称：济南蒋记美造飞机，常给城内伪军运送弹药食物，对四关居民则滥肆轰炸扫射。东关东大街开茶馆的金连生一家八口，只剩了一个被炸伤的母亲和她的孩子。空袭威胁，使原设在东关柳园的集市，不得不另移地点，但当新集开始时，东关仍极热闹。每集均在五万人以上。当记者于战事甫停入城巡视时，却见了另一景象：全城房屋被毁者几逾三分之一。在阒无人迹的高大破房中，偶尔钻出因饥饿而瘦黄虚弱的居民，抱着我入城战士，倾诉其数年来之悲痛。城内原有居民一万五千人，彼等早在执行小组初来聊城时，即请愿要求救济，冀脱离此一人间地狱出城谋生，我方代表朱子卫，亦力主释放穷苦群众出城予以救济，但蒋方代表却坚不答复，致发生严重之饥荒。此时曾勾结日寇害死抗日老英雄范筑先，现又统率全城伪军的蒋记第五作战司令兼山东第六专员王金祥，竟公开宣称：“为了军事行动，饿死三万、五万老百姓不算啥。”为此全城群众受害者达三千余人。但王金祥及其他伪军头子的食物，却是美造蒋机自济南送来的，白面牛油和海带。我民主政府入城后，即行安定秩序，抚恤救济，逃躲出外的难民均已纷纷回城，重整其破碎的家园。
