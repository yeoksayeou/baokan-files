    Wu Manyou Teaches His Son
    (Note: This article was written by Wu Manyou's youngest son, Wu Zhonggui, who is currently studying at Yan'an City Elementary School.)
    "When your mother died, you were only four years old. At that time, our family was poor, and we often didn't have rice to cook for days. We shivered in the cold winter months. Poor thing! Your mother suffered with me her whole life, and she didn't even get to eat a bite of noodles before she died!" Whenever my father spoke of my mother, tears would stream down his face, and I would secretly cry along with him.
    My father said, "Your mother left us, but we still have to live! There was no other way, so I took your brother and carried firewood into the city to sell. We sold it for a dollar a day, and had to pay half a dollar in tax. Carrying firewood hunched my back, and I still didn't have enough to eat. It made my whole body ache; I couldn't sit or sleep. I'd fall down on the road to rest, and your brother would have to help me up. Once, it got dark, and I was walking back after selling firewood alone. I fell halfway and couldn't get up, so I lay under a stone cliff all night. Back then, the threshold of the school was too high, and our legs were too short to cross it. We had to remain illiterate and be beasts of burden our whole lives."
    "By 1936, this place had become Red. The Communist Party drove away the landlords and bureaucrats, and our family was allocated 100 hectares of land. Life got better day by day. Look at our granary, sheepfold, cattle pen, pigs, sheep, and cattle now! We have everything we need. It's all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership that we were liberated!" Whenever my father spoke of Chairman Mao, he would smile happily, and I would smile happily along with him.
    "The schools now are built for us peasants. The schools are our own schools! You must study hard in school. You come from a peasant background, you are the son of a peasant. In school, just like at home, you must help the school with production. Don't forget about production." When my father said the word "production," he said it with particular force, and I listened with particular sincerity.
    I must firmly remember my father's words and fulfill my father's hopes.

    吴满有教子
    （按：这篇文章是吴满有的小儿子吴仲贵写的，他现在延安市完小读书。）
    “你妈妈死的时候，你才四岁，那时咱家里穷，三天两头没米下锅，寒冬腊月冻的混身发抖。可怜呀！你妈跟上我受了一辈子苦，临死啦，连想吃口面都没吃到嘴啊！”爸爸每逢说起妈妈，就籁籁的流下泪来，我也暗暗的跟着哭了。
    爸爸说：“你妈丢下一家走啦，咱一家还得活嘛！没办法，我就带上你哥背柴进城去卖，一天卖上一块钱，就得半块钱上税，背柴把背压驼了，一天还是不够一天吃，熬的我混身痛，坐不下，睡不下，一倒在路上歇歇，就得你哥往起扶。有一次，天黑了，我一个人卖罢柴往回走，走到半路上跌倒了，爬也爬不起，就在石崖底下躺了一夜。那时候，学校的门槛高，咱们穷人腿短，跨不进去，只好一辈子不识字，做牛做马。”
    “到三六年上，咱这达红了，共产党赶走了地主官僚，咱家分下了一百垧地，光景一天比一天好了，你迩刻看看咱家的粮囤、羊圈、牛棚、猪呀！羊呀！牛呀！要啥有啥，这都是毛主席领导的咱们翻了身啊！”爸爸每逢说到毛主席，就高兴的笑起来，我也高兴的跟着笑了。
    “迩刻的学校，就是给咱们庄稼汉办的，学校就是咱们自己的学校！你在学校里可要好好的用心读书，你是庄稼汉出身，你是庄稼汉的儿子，在学校里和在家里一样，要好好帮助学校生产，不要把生产忘掉了。”爸爸说到生产两个字，说的特别有劲，我也听的特别真。
    我一定要牢牢记着爸爸的话，一定要实现爸爸的希望。
