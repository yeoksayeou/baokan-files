　　Examples of In-Depth Political Education
    Sun Ming

    Currently, conducting political education during winter studies and Spring Festival entertainment is a very important task. We are excerpting two paragraphs from Comrade Sun Ming's article "How to Deepen Political Education Among the Masses" below for local reference.

    --Editor

    If we want to conduct political education in a deep-seated manner, we must constantly conduct mass ideological surveys to accurately grasp what knots are stuck in the masses' minds.

    Recently, Comrade Ma Yuzhong, a mass leader in Heze County, chatted with many members of the farmers' association and people from all walks of life. He wanted to see what the masses were thinking at this moment, and he had to get an accurate diagnosis. As a result, he discovered that because of the many rumors in the past and the insufficient political education, the masses in many villages had developed "fear," fear of airplanes and fear of the Yellow River's floods. But they still felt that it would not be easy for the stubborn army to spread its wings in the liberated areas, but they were a little annoyed by "American aid to Chiang Kai-shek." Comrade Ma Yuzhong identified the biggest knot in the masses' minds at the moment, which was the issue of "American aid to Chiang Kai-shek." Then, when the village cadres of Lingsheng District held a forum on current affairs, Lao Ma went there to help. When Guo Yunchen, the mass leader of that district, gave an enlightening speech, he immediately latched onto the knot of "American aid to Chiang Kai-shek." Sure enough, everyone's spirits immediately rose, those who were half-lying down sat up straight, and those who were already sitting moved closer, which was clearly different from the past when they did not understand the masses' thoughts and explained current affairs in a general way, level by level. In this way, the special agents' vicious rumors and the masses' negative emotions seemed very serious at first glance, but in fact, they could not withstand our investigation and research. Once we found the knot and used a method to untie it, the masses' thinking would change "with a swish."

    However, if you want to completely untie the knot, you must prescribe the right medicine. For example, at the Lingsheng District village cadre forum, after Lao Ma's enlightening report, they broke into groups for discussion. In the group that Lao Ma helped, Yang Huangxing, the poor peasant representative, first spoke and said: "After listening to this report, it is really better than taking medicine. I know that only a few bad guys in the United States are helping Chiang Kai-shek, and they are still helping secretly. The American people and the democratic countries all over the world are helping us. It turns out that we are not alone, so what is there to be afraid of? The Eighth Route Army fought so hard in the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and with the masses in our villages, nothing matters. If the stubborn army comes, I will definitely lead the stretcher team to confront them!" This statement had a greater effect than the enlightening report. Everyone's fear gradually subsided, and their passion rose. One by one, they talked about "our favorable conditions," and one after another, they dug them out of everyone's experience, thus immediately increasing their confidence and determination. During the discussion, one person did not understand and suddenly replied: "The Eighth Route Army has fate, it has the world, and it should prosper!" The chairman of the farmers' association, Zhang Datun, then said: "Don't be superstitious, buddy. You see that the Eighth Route Army has fate, but I see that it has the masses. You see, this is nothing, but with this, you will have everything you need, and you will not be afraid of the stubborn army's attack." After a few more people's earnest explanations, the person who believed in "fate" nodded repeatedly in agreement. The final conclusion of the discussion was: No amount of help can compare to the help of the common people. If the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army unite with the common people, and the common people all work together, no matter how powerful the stubborn army's attack is, we will not be afraid of American aid. In this way, mobilize the masses to talk about the knot in their minds, and the leaders only "guide" them when they don't speak, and "pull" them back when they are far away. When everyone's emotions are high, put forward inspiring slogans and stimulate preparations for action. In this way, follow the laws of the masses' own ideological movement and let the masses untie the knots in their own minds themselves.

　　深入时事教育的范例
    孙明
    目前在冬学中，在春节文娱中，进行时事教育，是一个很重要的工作。兹将孙明同志“怎样把时事教育深入群众”一文中之两段节录于次，以供各地参考。
    ——编者
    我们想把时事教育进行得深入，得常做群众思想调查，随时摸准群众思想结住了啥疙瘩。
    最近荷泽县的群众领袖马裕中同志，找了许多农会会员和各色人闲谈，他要看看群众这会儿到底想啥，非得诊透脉不行。结果他发现了因为过去谣言多，时事教育进行得不够，许多村子群众形成了“怕”，怕飞机、怕黄水，但总还觉着顽军来解放区展翅总也不易，惟对“美国帮助老蒋”一点感到恼火。马裕中同志找清了群众目前思想上一个最大的疙瘩，就在“美国帮老蒋”这一点上。接着灵圣区的村干部座谈时事，老马去那里去帮助，当那个区的群众领袖郭运臣做启发时，劈头就咬住“美国帮老蒋”这个疙瘩上；果然，大家的精神立刻提起来，半躺着的坐好了，本来坐着的更往前凑近来，与过去不了解群众思想情形，一级级的囫囵讲解时事显然不同了。这样特务的恶毒谣言，群众的消沉情绪，乍看怪严重的，其实那里经得起我们的这一个调查研究，找准疙瘩，生法一解，“刷拉”一下，群众的思想就变过来了。
    可是想彻底解疙瘩，还得对症下药，如在灵圣区村干部座谈会上，老马启发报告后，即分组讨论，老马帮助的那个组，贫农代表杨黄兴首先发言说：“刚才听了这个报告，真比吃一剂药还强，知道美国不过有少数坏蛋帮老蒋，还挂着个偷帮，美国人民和天下的民主国都帮咱，原来咱也不孤，怕啥呢？八路军在八年抗战中仗打的这么硬，还有咱各村上的群众，啥来了都不要紧，顽军要来，我一定带着担架队干上去！”这一番话，比启发报告作用更大，大家怕心渐退，激情上升，一个一个谈下去，关于“我们的有利条件”，一条一端的又从大伙的经验里面翻腾出来，于是立时增高了信心和决心。谈的中间，有一个人没有弄通，忽然答腔道：“八路军是有命，有天下，该着兴啦”！农会长张大屯就接着说：“别迷信啦，伙计，你看八路军有命，我看他是有群众，你看这不算啥，有这，也就要啥有啥，也不怕顽军进攻啦。”又经几个人紧说慢解，那个信“命”的人连连点头称是。末了谈的结论是：无论啥帮助都顶不住老百姓帮助，共产党、八路军同老百姓抱成一个，老百姓一齐干上去，多么厉害的顽军进攻，美国帮忙都不怕它。就这样，发动群众围绕着他们思想上的那个疙瘩谈，领导上只在没有开腔时“引引”，拉远了往回“牵牵”，待大家情绪高涨起来了，提出鼓动的口号，激成行动的准备。就这样，循着群众自己思想运动规律，让群众自己思想上的疙瘩自己来解。
