Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the "Summary of the Work of the Military Mediation Department in One Year" published on January 12th by Chiang Kai-shek's pro-government Central News Agency, which attempted to shift the responsibility for violating the ceasefire entirely to the Chinese Communist Party. However, facts speak louder than any sophistry. In the past year, Chiang Kai-shek has invaded liberated areas covering 179,000 square kilometers of land with a population of 20 million, and 165 cities. This is the best evidence of who violated the ceasefire and who attacked whom.

In reality, Chiang Kai-shek had no genuine intention of a ceasefire even before the ceasefire order was signed. After the ceasefire order was signed, he continued to violate it. There is no need to cite many pieces of evidence; just look at Chiang Kai-shek's own order of January 7th last year (the so-called "Chairman" Ziyang telegram):

"The Political Consultative Conference will be held within days. Our troops should occupy advantageous locations before the ceasefire order is issued. Those who have been ordered to advance to a certain place but have not yet arrived should be urged to advance day and night. Areas that have not yet been disarmed should be ordered to disarm immediately by local garrison troops to prevent them from being exploited by treacherous troops. Actions must be secret and swift to avoid providing excuses for the Communist side." And look at the "Chairman's handwritten order" that Sun Lianzhong relayed to his subordinates on January 12th: "The Marshall, Zhang Qun, and Zhou Enlai tripartite meeting discussed holding a comprehensive ceasefire before the political conference. The ceasefire order will be issued to all departments on the evening of the 10th. Before the ceasefire order takes effect, strategic points should be seized as quickly as possible, especially in the Rehe area. It is best to occupy Chengde before the ceasefire order. Otherwise, Gubeikou, Jianping, and Lingyuan must be seized quickly."

This is the true picture of Chiang Kai-shek issuing a public ceasefire order while secretly issuing operational orders. He paid so much attention to "occupying advantageous locations" and "seizing strategic points," and to "advancing day and night" to deal with the so-called "treacherous troops." Is there any hint of a genuine ceasefire here? An important provision of the ceasefire order was that all troop movements should cease. However, of the 218 brigades that Chiang Kai-shek is currently using to attack the liberated areas, 210 brigades were illegally transferred. Among these illegally transferred troops, 10 armies and 29 divisions were transported by the U.S. side in violation of the agreement (including 4 armies and 12 divisions, and 2 traffic police corps outside the customs, and 6 armies and 17 divisions, and 6 traffic police corps inside the customs). The Chinese Communist Party has protested this countless times, but both the Chiang and U.S. sides have ignored it.

The escalating civil war in Northeast and North China is the result of the Chiang-U.S. collaboration in violating the agreement by transporting this large army to "advance day and night" and "seize strategic locations." After the civil war broke out in Northeast China, the Kuomintang, Communist Party, and U.S. signed the "Northeast Ceasefire Agreement" on March 27th, but Chiang Kai-shek refused to implement it and allowed the fighting to escalate in Northeast China.

During the Nanjing negotiations in June, despite the major concessions made by the Chinese Communist Party, Chiang Kai-shek deliberately put forward four unreasonable demands, preventing the negotiations from succeeding. Secretly, he planned an attack on General Li Xiannian's troops in the Central Plains Military Region. On June 13th, the Sixth Pacification Headquarters, presided over by Chiang Kai-shek's confidant Liu Zhi, issued the Yiyuan telegram, stipulating the "operational plan" against the Central Plains Military Region. A vast area east of the Dabie Mountains, west to Suizao, south to the Yangtze River, and spanning the Pinghan Railway, was deployed with detailed plans for attack and prevention of breakout, attempting to "encircle and annihilate" them in one fell swoop. On June 26th, while the Nanjing negotiations were still underway, the "encirclement and annihilation" had already begun. General Li Xiannian's troops were forced to break through. The Central News Agency falsely claimed that Li Xiannian's troops "scattered and harassed" in three routes.

As a result of Chiang Kai-shek ordering his troops to "seize strategic locations," from January to June of last year, they launched 4,365 attacks on the liberated areas, occupied 4,151 strongholds, 40 of our cities, and 2,577 of our villages and towns, using a total of more than 2.77 million troops.

After July of last year, Chiang Kai-shek, with the continued support of the U.S. imperialists, launched a full-scale civil war, and in November, he made the absurd statement of "militarily defeating the Communist army within five months." At the time of the convening of the pseudo-"National Assembly," the dream of "taking Yan'an as a gift" actually appeared in Nanjing.

In November, Chiang Kai-shek staged another "ceasefire order" farce. However, the telegraph ordering Chiang Kai-shek's troops to continue advancing and explaining to his subordinates that this "ceasefire order" was only for propaganda purposes was also captured by us on the front line.

Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda organs are trying to obliterate the ironclad facts known to Chinese and foreign people over the past year, attempting to blame the Chinese Communist Party and the military and civilians in the liberated areas. They only show their utter boredom and futile efforts. The issue now is that the military positions of January 13th last year must be restored, the Political Consultative Conference line must be implemented, and the pseudo-National Assembly and pseudo-constitution must be abolished. All sophistry and the spreading of any smokescreens are of no avail.

### 破坏停战令的责任  完全在于蒋美两方  中央社妄图狡辩推卸，新华社记者列举事实予以痛斥。

　　破坏停战令的责任
    完全在于蒋美两方
    中央社妄图狡辩推卸，新华社记者列举事实予以痛斥。
    【新华社延安廿一日电】新华社记者评论一月十二日蒋介石御用的中央社所发表的“军调部一年工作总结”，妄图将破坏停战令的责任全推在中共身上。但是，事实胜于一切狡辩，去年一年蒋介石侵占了解放区有二千万人民的十七万九千多平方公里的土地，和一百六十五座城市，这是谁破坏停战令、谁进攻谁的最好证据。
    实际上，蒋介石在停战令签定之前，也并无真心停战。停战令签定之后，则一直破坏着停战。证据不须多举，只要看看蒋介石自己去年一月七日的命令（即所谓“委座”子阳电）：
    “政治协商会日内开会，我军应于停战令未下前占领有利地点，已下令前进至某地而尚未到达者，应催促其星夜前进；其尚未缴械地区，应速令当地驻军施行缴械，免被奸军利用。行动务希秘密迅速，勿资共方借口”。再看看一月十二日孙连仲向所部转达的“委座手令”：“马歇尔、张群、周恩来三人会议商议在政治会议前举行全面停战，停战令灰（十日）晚即可下达各部。在停战令未生效前，应速抢占战略要点，尤其是热河方面，最好于停战命令前占领承德，否则亦必迅速抢占古北口、建平及凌源为要。”。
    这就是蒋介石一面下公开的停战令，一面却下秘密的作战令的真象。他那样注意要“占领有利地点”，要“抢占战略要点”，并要“星夜前进”来对付所谓“奸军”，这里有任何一点真正停战的气味吗？停战令一项重要规定，是军队一律停止调动。但是，蒋介石现在用在进攻解放区的二百一十八个旅中，有二百十个旅系违约调动的。这些违法调动的军队中，又有十个军二十九个师系美方违约代运的（计关外四个军十二个师、两个交通警察总队，关内六个军十七个师、六个交通警察总队）。中共对此曾作过无数次的抗议，均被蒋美两方置之不理。
    东北、华北内战之所以日益扩大，就是蒋美合作违约运送此大军“星夜前进”、“抢占战略要地”的结果。东北内战发生后，国共美三方于三月二十七日签订“东北停战协定”，但蒋介石又拒绝实行，放手在东北大打。
    六月南京谈判，尽管中共作如重大让步，蒋介石故意提出四项无理要求，使谈判不能成功，暗中却布置对于中原军区李先念将军所部之进攻。六月十三日，蒋介石亲信刘峙主持的第六绥靖公署颁发已元电，规定对中原军区的“作战计划”，东沿大别山，西至随枣，南至长江，中跨平汉路的广大地区，都布署了进攻与防止突围的详细计划，企图一举“围歼”。六月二十六日，南京谈判还在进行时，“围歼”即已开始。李先念将军所部迫不得已才突围。中央社反说是李先念部分三路“窜扰”。
    蒋介石令其部队“抢占战略要地”的结果，从去年一月至六月，共向解放区进攻四千三百六十五次，被攻据点四千一百五十一处，占我城市四十个，占我村镇二千五百七十七个，其使用兵力总计二百七十七万余人。
    去年七月以后，蒋介石在美帝国主义者继续支持下发动全面内战，十一月间，并作“五个月内在军事上击溃共军”之荒唐语。伪“国大”召开之际，“打下延安作礼物”的梦话，也居然在南京出现了。
    十一月，蒋介石又来了一次“停战令”的插曲。但是，蒋介石命令其部队继续前进，向其部下说明这个“停战令”只是宣传作用的电令也在前线被我们缴获了。
    蒋介石的宣传机关竟想抹煞一年来中外人士所共知的铁般事实，企图诿罪于中共与解放区军民，只见其无聊万分、心劳日拙而已。现在的问题，是去年一月十三日的军事位置一定要恢复，政协路线一定要贯彻，伪国大、伪宪法一定要取消，一切狡辩和散布任何烟幕都无济于事。
