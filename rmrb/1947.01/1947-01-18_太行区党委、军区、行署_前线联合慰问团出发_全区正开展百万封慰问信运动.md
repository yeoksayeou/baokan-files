    Joint Frontline慰问团 Set Off
    Whole District Launches Million-Letter慰问信 Campaign
    [Report from Changzhi on the 14th by this newspaper] As the Lunar New Year approaches, the Taihang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Military Region Headquarters, the Political Department, and the Administrative Office, representing the five million people of the Taihang District, have formed a joint frontline慰问团 to go to the frontlines to慰问 all the commanders and fighters of the Third and Sixth Columns, the hero-killers, and the wounded soldiers, to wish them a Happy New Year and celebrate their victories. The group departed by car a few days ago, carrying 20,000 packs of cigarettes, 3,000 dozen towels, and a letter of慰问, which stated in brief: We are intensifying the implementation of the policy of "land to the tillers," and fully mobilizing the masses to support the victory of the self-defense war. We are also launching a broad movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families, and further improve the preferential treatment of your families. Furthermore, to greet the New Year and慰问 the frontline, the entire Taihang District is launching a million-letter慰问信 campaign. In addition to writing nine letters of慰问, cadres and staff of the Administrative Office donated 4,730 yuan (old currency) worth of books and newspapers for慰问 purposes and some other items, and慰问 resident military families. During the慰问, they wrote 28 letters on behalf of military families to soldiers on the frontlines, and collected over 6,500 yuan (old currency) worth of books and newspapers for慰问 from the villagers. The wife of soldier Wang Qingzhang from the village, in her letter to her husband, not only described in detail the family's situation of gaining land after emancipation, but also sent 600 yuan that she earned from spinning, telling her husband to have a good New Year.
