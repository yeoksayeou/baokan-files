    The Soviet People Commemorate the 23rd Anniversary of Lenin's Death with Intense Labor to Fulfill the Five-Year Plan
    [This Dispatch] According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 22nd: "Pravda" recently published an editorial stating: Yesterday, the Soviet state and progressive people around the world piously praised and commemorated the great Lenin. Every year on January 21st, the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people summarize the achievements of their struggle to realize Lenin's legacy and plan their work for the near future. The Soviet people are currently commemorating the 23rd anniversary of Lenin's death with intense labor to fulfill the post-war Five-Year Plan. The Party and the Soviet people are now focusing on economic construction, rehabilitation, and higher development of the national economy. Reviewing the results of the first year of the new Five-Year Plan and the initial achievements in the rehabilitation and post-war development of the national economy, the Soviet people see the great gains our country has made in completing Lenin's great legacy under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin. Thanks to the Lenin and Stalin policies of our Party, our country has become a great socialist power, and thus we won the victory of the Patriotic War. The current socialist economy has created a foundation that enables the people to launch an economic recovery and further peaceful construction on a broad front and achieve unprecedented achievements in a short period of time. In the first year of the post-war Five-Year Plan, when the national economy turned to the path of peaceful development, the Soviet people clearly realized that the question of time is of decisive importance at present. Under the Soviet system, tens of millions of soldiers and workers link their personal labor with the national work and the interests of the entire Soviet state. Under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and under the guidance of the great Stalin, the Soviet people are building a communist society. The Party inspires and directs millions of working people to strive towards a single goal.
