　　Weixian Second District Cadres Overcome Paralysis
    Go Deep into the Masses to Break Through Backwardness
    Su Village New Activists Connect with Honest Peasants Who Complain Bitterly
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 17th Dispatch] Weixian Second District cadres overcame paralysis, jumped out of the circle of village cadres, and went deep into the masses to break through the backward village of Su Village. Initially, the district cadres felt that the village was small and there were not many problems, and that the work could be started quickly. When a meeting of village cadres and activists was convened in the village, they all said: "Our village people have always been peaceful and don't like to make suggestions. All the people in the village are either middle peasants or prosperous middle peasants, and they all have food and drink, so there is no need to mobilize them." Some said: "Our village has more than 70 women members and 40 militiamen, and most of the other households are backward elements and cannot be absorbed into the organization." At that time, the district cadres were somewhat skeptical, but did not study it in depth. Then, a meeting of group leaders and basic masses was convened, but few people expressed their opinions. The district cadres were afraid that the work in this village would lag behind, so they told the village cadres about the masses' reflections on the village cadres, asked them to conduct self-criticism, and aroused the anger of the masses. But after doing this, the masses still did not move. At this time, the district cadres deeply felt that they were only floating in the circle of village cadres and had not gone deep into the masses, and had already taken a detour. They immediately went to find honest peasants for individual talks, and discovered a new activist, Ergeng, who connected with more than a dozen people in one afternoon, and automatically came to the district cadres for a meeting after dinner. At the meeting, Ergeng complained bitterly: "My family of eleven starved eight to death during the famine years, and sold all the land. When I came back, the landlord made trouble and wouldn't let me redeem it." Xiao Si complained bitterly: "The landlord falsely accused my brother of stealing cotton, and the Japanese devils beat my grandfather to death, scared my mother to death, and arrested my brother and beat him half to death. After he was released, he died begging outside." At this point, both Xiao Si and Ergeng burst into tears. Someone said: "Poor people who commit minor mistakes are sometimes expelled from the peasant association, and some are asked to confess in public meetings, and no one dares to speak." After understanding the situation, the district cadres are now mobilizing new activists to carry out connections, educating old village cadres to transform their work style, reorganizing the organization, and thoroughly settling accounts with the local tyrants and evil gentry.

　　威县二区区干克服麻痹
    深入群众突破落后
    苏庄新积极分子串连老实农民纷纷诉苦
    【本报威县十七日电】威县二区干部克服麻痹，跳出村干部圈子，深入群众中去，突破苏庄落后村。当初区干部感到该村村小没多少问题，工作能很快搞起来，当召开该村村干及积极分子会时，都说：“俺村群众向来好和平，不好提意见。全村人不是中农即是富裕中农，都有吃有喝，不必发动”。有的说：“俺村有七十多户农妇会员，民兵四十名，其他户多是落后分子，不能吸收参加组织”。当时区干部有些怀疑，但未深刻研究。接着又召开了小组长及基本群众会，很少有人发表意见。区干部恐怕这村工作落了后，即把群众对村干的反映告诉村干，叫他们进行检查，并向群众认错，把群众的气鼓起来。但这样作后，群众仍然不动。这时区干部深刻感到只浮飘在村干中打圈子，没深入群众中去，已经走了弯路。即分头寻找老实农民，作个别谈话，发现了新积极分子二刚，一下午即串连了十多人，晚饭后自动来找区干开会。会上二刚诉苦：“我一家十一口，灾荒年饿死了八口，把地都卖了，回来地主捣鬼，还不叫赎。”小四诉苦：“地主诬告俺哥哥偷花，和日本鬼子把俺爷打死，把俺娘吓死，把哥哥抓去打了好几个死，放出后要饭死在外边”。说到这里，小四、二刚都放声大哭。有人说：“穷人犯点小错，有的被开除农会，有的叫在大会上坦白，谁也不敢说话”。区干了解情况后，现正发动新积极分子进行串连，教育旧村干改造作风，整理组织，彻底清算恶霸地主。
