Comrade Mao Zedong's Childhood (Continued)
    Xiao San

　　Always with the Oppressed Since Childhood

    Comrade Mao Zedong continued to read old Chinese novels, and he especially liked to read stories of resistance against the oppression of the ruling class. (His later comments: "Water Margin" is the first good long novel in China, and "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" is the first good collection of short stories. The author, Pu Songling, opposed corrupt officials and advocated free love. Although he praised the concubine system and bound feet, etc., that was limited by the times. He did not dare to openly oppose the old system, so he used fox spirits to preach. But after all, it is a social novel. Lu Xun classified this book as a strange novel, which was his view before he accepted Marxism... it was wrong.) When he was about fifteen or sixteen years old, on the way to Dongshan School, Comrade Zedong suddenly discovered a problem—why are the characters in those novels only emperors, generals, sages, gentlemen, and heroes... and not the farmers who till the fields that he often saw and came into contact with? This made him feel strange for a long time—a full year or two. Later, Comrade Zedong discovered that the characters in the old novels were all rulers, oppressors, and exploiters—they did not cultivate themselves, occupied the land, and asked the farmers to work for them.

    Reader's attention: This is a discovery of great significance! From this, it can be seen that Comrade Mao Zedong has been with the broad masses of working people since he was a child, thinking of the masses and sympathizing with the masses. He himself came from the lower strata of the masses, and he has a deep connection with the people. Even now, when he leads the party, government, army, and people, and earnestly educates cadres with the mass viewpoint, constantly reiterating and patiently saying that at all times and in all things, they must think of the interests of the masses, that only the people are the most reliable, that the source of the power of the masses is inexhaustible, that "the people, only the people, are the motive force for creating the world" ("On Coalition Government"), and when he talks about the methods of leading and solving all problems, he has two famous sayings: "From the masses, to the masses," and in military strategy, he created principles such as "mass warfare" and "people's war"... all of these may have been rooted in his childhood.

    During a great famine year, Comrade Mao Zedong and a group of elementary school students saw many rice merchants returning to the countryside from Changsha outside the private school. The children asked the rice merchants why they all left Changsha. The rice merchants told them about an event—a famine! Tens of thousands of people starved to death in Changsha alone. The victims sent representatives to the governor's office to request relief. But the governor's reply was: "Why don't you have food to eat? There is plenty of rice in the city. You see, I eat my fill every day"; The victims rioted when they heard the governor's reply. They gathered in groups to attack the yamen, cut off the flagpole at the yamen gate, the symbol of official rule, and drove away the governor. Later, a senior official of the Provincial Administration Commission, named Zhuang Gengliang, rode out on horseback and told the people that the government was thinking of ways to provide disaster relief... So the victims temporarily dispersed, but the Manchu emperor dismissed the Zhuang, saying that he was "colluding with rioters." Then came a governor, and he immediately ordered the arrest of the leaders of the incident and beheaded them for public display....

    The elementary school students listened to this story and discussed it for many days. Most of them expressed sympathy for the rebels, but only took a bystander attitude. Comrade Mao Zedong felt at that time that those rebels were like the people in his hometown, so he felt very unfair and hated the rulers' treatment of them.

    Another time, the Gelaohui (also farmers) in Comrade Zedong's hometown had a conflict with a landlord. The landlord filed a complaint with the government. The landlord was rich and powerful, so naturally he won the lawsuit, but the Gelaohui refused to accept it and ran to a mountain and built a fortress. The government troops went to fight them, and the landlord also spread rumors that the Gelaohui killed a child to sacrifice the flag when they decided to rebel; the Gelaohui rebellion was eventually suppressed. A blacksmith who was the leader ran away, but was later caught and beheaded. Comrade Zedong and his classmates all sympathized with this rebellion and praised the blacksmith as a hero.

    The following year, when the crops were not yet ripe, there was an extreme shortage of rice in the countryside. The farmers had no food to eat, and the rich hoarded the grain and refused to sell it at a fair price. The poor people initiated a movement to eat the rich, and dozens or hundreds of hungry men, women, old people, and children ran to the homes of the rich, opened the warehouses, poured out the grain, ground it into rice in their homes, and cooked rice in their big pots. After eating at this house, they ate at that house.

    Comrade Zedong's father, who had always been in the grain business, still carried the grain from his hometown to the city to sell at this time. A batch of grain was detained by the poor people, and his father was very angry. Comrade Zedong did not approve of his father's method. He stood on the side of the poor.

    The father, as the head of the family, was very strict with his children and not considerate to his wife. The mother did not approve of this way of managing the family, but did not directly and openly resist. She just persuaded calmly or passively resisted. Sometimes the father ate good dishes by himself and did not give them to the mother. Finally, he gave her a little bit, but the mother had a strong sense of self-esteem and did not even eat that little bit. This and similar unequal phenomena were great stimuli for the young Comrade Mao Zedong. This may have planted the roots of his opposition to the feudal family oppression system, although he could not say the terms "feudal" and "patriarchal system" at that time.

    A "reformist" (or "radical") teacher came from Shaoshan Chong. This person's name was Li Shuqing, and he should be about eighty years old now. At that time, he opposed superstition, beat up Buddha statues, ran schools, and persuaded people to use temple property to set up schools. The villagers opposed him. Comrade Mao Zedong praised him and agreed with his views. But Comrade Zedong had believed in gods when he was eight or nine years old, because his mother was very religious. His father did not believe in gods, and he and his mother discussed how to persuade his father to believe in gods as well. ... Later, after reading some new books, he began to doubt the gods. By this time, he almost completely disbelieved in gods.

    This series of events gave the young Comrade Mao Zedong a very deep impression. He had a rebellious mind against the actions of the ruling class and against the gods used by the rulers to fool the people. He sympathized with the ruled and the oppressed. During this period, Comrade Mao Zedong began to have some degree of political consciousness.

　　毛泽东同志的儿童时代（续完）
    萧三
  　从小就和被压迫者在一道
    毛泽东同志继续阅读中国的旧小说，他尤其喜欢读一些反抗统治阶级压迫的故事。（他后来的评论，《水浒传》是中国第一部好的长篇小说，《聊斋志异》是第一部好的短篇小说集，作者蒲松龄反对贪官污吏，主张自由恋爱，虽然赞美妾婢制及小脚等等，那是为时代所限，他不敢公开反对旧制度，故借狐鬼说教，但究竟是一部社会小说。鲁迅将这部书列入怪异小说一类，当时是他在未接受马克思主义时的看法……是错了），当有一天大约是十五六岁时，去东山学校的路上，泽东同志忽然发现了一个问题——为什么那些小说故事里面的人物，只有君王将相，圣贤君子，英雄豪杰……而却没有他经常所见所接触的耕田的农人呢？这事使他奇怪了很久——整整一年多到两年。后来泽东同志发现了：原来旧小说里面的人物都是一些流治者，压迫者，剥削者，——他们自己不耕种，占了土地叫农民替他们劳动。
    读者注意：这是一个有重大意义的发现！从这里可以看出毛泽东同志自小便和广大劳苦群众在一道，为群众着想，同情于群众。他自己就是下层群众里面出来的人呵，他和民众有很深的渊缘。直到现在他领导党政军民，谆谆教育干部们以群众观点，不断的反三复四，苦口婆心的说，要时时刻刻事事物物都要为群众利益着想，只有人民群众是最可靠的，群众力量的泉源是无穷尽的，“人民，只有人民才是创造世界的动力”（论联合政府）以及说领导和解决一切问题的方法时，他有两句名言：“从群众中来、到群众中去”，而在军事战略上制出“群众战”与“人民战争”一些原则……所有这些未始不都是在小时候就伏下了根的。
    一个大荒年，毛泽东同志和一群小学生在私塾外面看见许多米商从长沙回到乡下来，小孩子们问米商为什么都离开了长沙。米商告诉了他们一件事变——闹饥荒呀！长沙一个地方就饿死了成千成万的人，灾民们推出代表到抚台衙门去请求救济。但巡抚的回答是：“为什么你们没有饭吃呢，城里米多的很，你们看我每天都是吃得饱的”；灾民们听到巡抚这样的答复，骚动起来了。他们聚群结队去攻打衙门，砍断了衙门口的旗杆子，官厅统治的标志，赶走了巡抚。后来布政司一位大员叫庄赓良的，骑马出来，晓谕人民说，官府正在想法救灾……于是灾民暂时散了，可是满清皇帝却革了那个姓庄的职，说他“勾结乱党”。接着来了一个巡抚，他立即下令逮捕事变的为首者，把他枭首示众……。
    小学生们听了这个故事，议论了好多天，大多数对造反的也都表示同情，但只是采取旁观的态度，毛泽东同志那时便觉得，那此造反的都是像自己的家乡一样的人，所以对统治者对他们的处置，很抱不平，很是痛恨。
    又一次泽东同志本乡的哥老会（也是农民）和一个地主发生冲突，地主到官府告了状。地主有钱有势，自然官司打赢了，但是哥老会不服，跑到一个山里，建起堡寨来。官兵去打他们，那个地主还造谣说，哥老会决定造反的时候杀死了一个小孩子祭旗；哥老会的反叛，最后被镇压下去了。为头的一个铁匠跑了，但后来又被抓了回来，杀了头。泽东同志和他的小同学们都同情这次叛乱，都称赞那个为首的铁匠是英雄。
    第二年青黄不接的时候，乡下异常缺米，农人没有饭吃，富人都把谷子囤积起来，不肯平价粜出。穷人们就发起吃大户的运动，成十成百挨饿的男的女的老的少的，都跑到富户家去，打开仓库，倒出谷子，就在他家里磨成米，就用他家里大锅煮饭吃，吃了这家又吃那家。
    素来做谷米生意的泽东同志的父亲，在这时候，仍然把本乡的粮食挑到城里去卖，有一批谷米被穷人们扣留了，父亲非常生气，泽东同志不赞成父亲这种办法，他站在穷苦人这方面。
    父亲这个家长对儿辈非常严厉，对妻室也不体贴。母亲不赞成这种治家的办法，但不直接公开反抗，只是从容劝说，或消极抵抗，父亲有时自己一个人吃好的菜，不给母亲吃，最后给一点点，但母亲自尊心重，连那一点点也不吃了，这种和类似这种的不平等现象对于幼年的泽东同志是大的刺激。这也种下了他反对封建家庭压迫制度的根吧，虽然那时候说不出“封建”“家长制度”这些名词。
    韶山冲本地出了一个“维新派”（或“急进派”）的教员，这人姓李名漱清，现在当有八十来岁了，那时他反对迷信，打菩萨，办学堂，劝人用庙产兴学。乡下人都反对他。毛泽东同志却称赞他，赞同他的意见，但泽东同志在八九岁的时候却曾信神，因为他的母亲是非常信神的，他父亲不信神，他还和母亲讨论过，如何劝父亲也信神起来。……后来读了一些新书，他对神开始怀疑了，到这时候，他几乎完全不信神了。
    这一连串的事情给予了幼年的毛泽东同志以非常深的印象。他对于统治阶级的行事，对于统治者用以愚民的神，都存着反抗的心思了。他同情被统治者和被压迫者在一道。在这时期毛泽东同志开始有了某种程度的政治意识。
