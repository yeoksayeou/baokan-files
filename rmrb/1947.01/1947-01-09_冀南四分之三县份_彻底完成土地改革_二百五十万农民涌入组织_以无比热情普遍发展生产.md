[This dispatch from our correspondent in Weixian, dated the 7th] With the exception of ten counties including Linqing, Zaoqiang, and Nangong, which are currently undergoing a major review of their liberation process, the other thirty-odd counties in southern Hebei have thoroughly completed land reform through the movements of anti-traitor liquidation and leveling and compensation. A total of more than 5,500 villages have seen land return from the hands of feudal exploiters to the homes of peasants. For example, in Ningnan, all 16,804 poor peasant households and 1,706 extremely poor households have been eliminated. Poor peasants in Yuancheng, Jize, and Renxian counties have recovered 120,000 mu of land and more than 20,000 rooms of houses. 4.5 million peasants were involved in the struggle, and 2.5 million peasants participated in peasant associations, women's associations, and militias. The backward rural areas, marked by feudalism, are presenting a new look, and the peasants are, with unparalleled enthusiasm, engaged in sideline occupations such as oil pressing, flour milling, cotton ginning, salt leaching, and weaving in this severe winter, or running timber mills, cooperatives... busily traveling to markets. In more than 20 villages around Fengguanying in Jize, the sound of looms can be heard everywhere. The 43 weaving groups in Fudong Village produce more than 100 zhang of white cloth every day. In the seventh district of Yuancheng, there are 32 oil mills and more than 20 Western-style bows and gins, working day and night. Ma Zhili, an extremely poor peasant in Shanyue Village, had lost interest in life and hope under the exploitation of landlords, relying on his three sons to survive from day to day. After liberation, his family received 18 mu of land, and he suddenly began to collect firewood and manure and engage in production actively. He said: "In the past, starvation was due to the exploitation of the landlords, but if I starve again in the future, it will be my own fault. Now, I don't know why, but I always feel energetic."

As the lives of peasants have improved, their purchasing power has greatly increased, and industry and commerce have also embarked on prosperity. Since liberation, Hengshui has added more than 180 shopkeepers. In seven months, the Jianhua Ironworks produced 3,669 pots, 14,420 plowshares, and 9,367 other agricultural implements, but demand still exceeds supply. Small merchants in Yongzhi Kangzhuang all say: "Business is better now than in previous years." The market has expanded four times compared to before the mobilization of peasants. When Wangzhuang in Feixiang distributed fruits, special care was given to the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned. Old widow Jin Huaniang said: "Who cared about us poor people in the past? Now that we have Chairman Mao, I will live a few more years."

In the frenzy of liberation, peasants in Ningnan and Renxian launched mass cultural and recreational activities. During the grand review of the liberation process in Renxian, the masses exhibited 123 kinds of cartoons and more than 60 songs based on their own experiences of liberation. In Ningnan, the masses have compiled more than 150 kinds of quick clapper talks, songs, and dramas, and twisting Yangko dance has become a fashionable entertainment in the villages.
