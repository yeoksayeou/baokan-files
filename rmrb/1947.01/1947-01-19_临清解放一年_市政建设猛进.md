　　【This dispatch from Weixian, January 17th】The city of Linqing has been liberated for over a year, and municipal construction has made rapid progress. In terms of preferential treatment for military families, this city was occupied by the enemy and puppets for a long time in the past, and military families did not receive preferential treatment for eight years. This time, they are doing it this way: according to historical grading, those who participated in the War of Resistance for five to eight years will receive a supplementary allowance of one and a half year's worth of preferential grain in addition to the 180 catties of rice they should receive per person; those who participated for three to five years will receive a supplementary allowance of one year's worth; those who participated for more than one year to three years will receive a supplementary allowance of the full year's worth. In addition, impoverished military families with no labor capacity will receive an additional 30 catties of labor preferential grain per person every half year, as wages for hiring people to carry water and grind flour. This spring, impoverished military families will be given 20 catties of rice per room for mud house expenses based on their current housing, and 40 catties of substitute farming rice per mu, to be distributed in spring and autumn. Second, the masses in the city have shown great enthusiasm in supporting the army and supporting the front line. A total of four large-scale army support campaigns were carried out throughout the year, raising 7.56 million yuan. The donation campaign in November alone reached more than 6 million yuan, not to mention other foods such as eggs, rice, and pork. In addition, good care has also been taken of the 20 honorary veterans living here. Some were introduced to the salt cooperative and the shipping cooperative. Hui people were introduced to the Hui beef cooperative. Those in the shipping cooperative can earn 400 yuan a day, living a very comfortable life. Third, in terms of sanitation work, more than 70 garbage cans have been established throughout the city, and a cooperative of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners has been established. Impoverished citizens can get medicine at half price or free of charge. Three air defense and rescue associations and two fire fighting associations have also been established. Fourth, in terms of school education, there is now one middle school and three complete primary schools. There were only six or seven junior primary schools when it was first liberated, but now there are fifteen. More than 2,000 students in the city have enrolled, and a new policy of combining school with society, family with production has been implemented. Wuxun Complete Primary School has conducted two large-scale parades and current affairs publicity campaigns in the past year, which has had a great educational significance for the masses. Recently, more than 20 "student winter school work teams" have been organized to be responsible for teaching winter school classes in the four main streets. In terms of production, the students peeled cigarette butts, pasted cigarette boxes, and printed marks for the cigarette factory. During the two hours of intense production time each day, the most each person could earn was forty to fifty yuan. In this way, those who eat at school can solve 50% of their living expenses, and those who walk to school have a lot of savings in addition to buying books and stationery. The parents of impoverished students said: "Now going to school not only doesn't take money from home, but also earns money for the family." Fifth, in terms of social education, the Linqing City Mass Education Center and reading room have been officially established, becoming a cultural garden for the working masses. Merchants, farmers, workers, fruit sellers, and soy milk sellers all come here. The room is full every day. An impoverished old man from Chaohe Cliff Street said: "I wouldn't have dared to enter this door wearing this outfit before." The soy milk seller reads the newspaper every day after selling soy milk. In addition, twelve mass blackboard newspapers have been established, which timely broadcast national events and local conditions. The working masses, who have been subjected to cultural oppression for thousands of years, have begun to live a happy cultural life.
