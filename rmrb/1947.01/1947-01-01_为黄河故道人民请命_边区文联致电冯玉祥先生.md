Pleading for the People of the Old Yellow River Course
The Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles Sends a Telegram to Mr. Feng Yuxiang

[This newspaper reports] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Federation of Literary and Art Circles recently sent a telegram to Mr. Feng Yuxiang, who is in the United States studying water conservancy projects, urging him to speak out righteously and draw the attention of American officials and the public to stop Chiang Kai-shek's plot to breach the river and divert the water. The original telegram stated: The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, in order to save their military defeat, are now hastily planning to close the mouth of the Yellow River at Huayuankou and divert the water, condemning our seven million people along the river to death. Regarding the Yellow River management issue, the people of this region have signed four agreements with the Kuomintang, the main idea of which is to first repair the dangerous worksites, relocate residents, and then close the river mouth and divert the water. However, Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly violated the agreements and has not promptly allocated funds and materials for the project. The military offensives since August have also destroyed the project in many ways and robbed materials for repairing dikes, affecting the completion of the dangerous worksites. Mr. Feng, you are well aware of the crux of the Yellow River issue. If you can provide full assistance, it would be a great fortune for the country and the people of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu!

　　为黄河故道人民请命
    边区文联致电冯玉祥先生
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫文联顷致电留美考察水利工程之冯玉祥先生，吁请仗义执言，引起美国朝野人士之注意，制止蒋介石堵口放水阴谋，原电略称：蒋介石反动集团为挽救其军事败绩，近复亟谋于花园口将黄河合龙放水，治我沿河七百万人民于死地。按治黄问题，本区人民曾与国民党签订四次协议，其要意为先修复险工，迁移居民而后堵口放水。而蒋介石一再违反协议，并不迅速拨付工款工料。八月以来之军事进攻，又多方破坏工程并抢劫修堤物资，影响险工告成。先生洞悉黄河问题之症结，如能全力援助则国家幸甚，晋冀鲁豫人民幸甚！
