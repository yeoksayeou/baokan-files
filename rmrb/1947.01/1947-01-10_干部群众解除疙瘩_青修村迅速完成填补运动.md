    Cadres and Masses Resolve Grievances
    Qingxiu Village Rapidly Completes the Filling-in Movement
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 5th dispatch] After a new upsurge of bitterness-airing in Qin County's Qingxiu Village, the realization of "land to the tiller" has been announced. Of the original 41 poor peasant households, all but five have risen to become middle peasants. In Ni Village, which belongs to the same village, there are four rich peasant households with an average of 11 mu of land per person, and 83 middle peasant households with an average of 3 to 8 mu of land per person. The quality of the land also varies very little. The main reason why poor peasants have risen so quickly is that the fruits of struggle have been distributed fairly and reasonably. Before the great review of the turning-over, the village office and the cooperative each had a portion of fruits that were collected as public property without the consent of the masses. This time, they were also taken out for distribution. The peasants themselves formulated plans for turning-over. Those who had not turned-over could plan how much land, houses, and grain they needed to be divided. Those who had not completely turned-over needed to have something supplemented. This was studied and reviewed by the peasant association小组, and then approved by the mass meeting. During the discussion, the peasants showed mutual concession and love. Chen Mancang, who had once laid an ambush, also stood up and said: "I have also privately kept a few packages of needles. Now I will take them out for everyone to share." With such a distribution, the land problems in Qingxiu and Ni Village, several natural villages, have been satisfactorily resolved, and the cadres have become more united. Currently, members of the village peasant association account for more than 80% of the total village population. (Tian Zong)
    [Another dispatch] After the land reform in Qin County's Qingxiu Village, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become even closer. In the past, due to unfair distribution of fruits, there were many disagreements between cadres and the masses, and even the target of struggle was once shifted. The reason why the filling-in movement was completed so quickly this time was also because the cadres and the masses first resolved their grievances and united closely to fight the landlords. For example, Jia Junyun, chairman of the village peasant association, said to the masses: "In the past, I always thought I was good, but now I know that I am not a confidant of the masses, so everyone opposes me." He not only took out the things he had privately kept without the consent of the masses, but also reviewed his undemocratic style of the past few years from beginning to end, and was determined to consider everything for the masses in the future. The masses, seeing his repentance, did not let him return the fruits, and said in unison: "You have been running around all year, and your old father has not yet put on cotton clothes; we don't want to turn-over from you." Public security officer Ren Xiuwen and peasant association standing committee member Guo Shiyuan had disagreements with each other, so that when Ren Xiuwen advocated struggle, Guo Shiyuan shielded and did not allow it. This time, they also reflected on their mistakes, and their relationship became harmonious, and they returned the embezzled fruits to the masses. From then on, the gap between cadres and the masses was broken, and they truly achieved openness and sincerity. (Tian Zong)

    干部群众解除疙瘩
    青修村迅速完成填补运动
    【本报太岳五日电】沁县青修村经过新的诉苦高潮以后，耕者有其田已告实现。原有的四十一户贫农，除五户外，余均上升为中农，该村所属倪村富农四户，每人平均土地十一亩，中农八十三户，每人平均土地三至八亩，地质的肥瘦亦相差极微。这次贫农之所以迅速上升，主要由于斗争果实分配得公平合理。在翻身大检查前，村公所、合作社各存一部未经群众同意而收作公有的果实，这次也拿出分配了。农民自己订出翻身计划，没翻身的人，可计划自己需要分多少土地、房屋、粮食；未翻透身的人还需填补些什么东西，由农会小组研究审查，然后由群众大会通过。讨论中农民互让互爱，曾经打过埋伏的陈满仓，也站起来说：“我还私存几包针，现在拿出来大家分吧。”如此分配下来，青修、倪村几个自然村土地问题都圆满解决，干部之间亦更团结。现该村农会会员已占全村人口百分之八十以上。（天纵）
    【又讯】沁县清修村土地改革后，干部与群众的关系亦更加密切。该村前曾因果实分配不公，干部与群众之间意见重重，甚至曾经转移了斗争目标。此次填平补齐运动之所以迅速完成，亦因为干部与群众间首先把疙瘩解开，亲密团结对地主斗争。如该村农会主席贾俊云向群众说：“以前我总觉得自己不错，现在才知道不是群众的知心人，所以大家反对我。”他不但把未经群众通过而私自留下的东西拿出，并将几年来不民主的作风，从头到尾检讨了，下定决心以后凡事为群众打算。群众见他悔悟，不让他退果实，异口同声的说：“你整年奔跑，你的老父亲还没有穿上棉衣；我们不是要从你身上翻身。”公安员任秀文、农会常委郭士元，互相闹意见，以至任秀文主张斗争的人，郭士元便包庇不许，这次也反省了出来，彼此关系融洽，并将贪污果实退还群众。从此干部与群众之间的隔膜打破了，真正的达到开诚相见。（天纵）
