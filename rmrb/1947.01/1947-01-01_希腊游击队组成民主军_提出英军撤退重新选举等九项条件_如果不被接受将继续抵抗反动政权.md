Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 29th: According to a United Press report: The commanders of the Greek guerrillas announced on the 17th of this month at their headquarters in the Kaimakchalan Mountains in northern Greece that they have now formed the Greek Democratic Army and will fight until the British occupation forces withdraw from Greece and Greece restores its democratic status. The commanders also refuted the Greek government's slander that the Macedonian guerrillas had received external assistance from South Bao or other countries. According to an Associated Press report: Guerrilla Deputy Chief of Staff Karfa (alias) said: The guerrillas submitted a memorandum to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on November 24, requesting the organization of a joint delegation to investigate the truth in the guerrilla areas. Karfa agreed to cooperate and said that he had inspected the rear of the guerrilla team with reporters from various countries for three days and had submitted a detailed report on the results to the secretariat of the United Nations organization. The guerrillas have put forward nine truce conditions. If these conditions are not accepted, they will continue to resist the reactionary regime. The nine conditions are as follows: 1. Amnesty for political prisoners; 2. British troops are the cause of all evils in Greece and should withdraw from Greece; 3. Recognition of the wartime resistance achievements of the guerrillas; 4. Resistance personnel participate in the government; 5. Equal rights for democrats and monarchists; 6. Punish fascists who were attached to the enemy during the period of fall; 7. Purge military and political elements attached to the enemy; 8. Organize an army that truly represents the country; 9. Re-election. Karfa did not announce the strength of his troops, only saying: Every mountain is controlled by guerrillas, which has been confirmed by British military intelligence.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 29th: According to a Reuters report from Moscow: The Soviet Young Communist League's "Pravda" commented on the Greek situation, pointing out: "Many Greek government troops supported by the air force have proved unable to fight the democratic army. One reason is that they are unwilling to fight Greek patriots, and both officers and soldiers would rather join the other side. Another reason why the Greek government army is unable to gain the upper hand is that the democratic army has the widespread support of the people."

　　希腊游击队组成民主军
    提出英军撤退重新选举等九项条件
    如果不被接受将继续抵抗反动政权
    【新华社延安十二月二十九日电】据合众社讯：希腊游击队诸指挥官于本月十七日在希北开玛克恰兰山中总部宣布，现已组成希腊民主军，将奋斗至英占领军退出希腊及希腊恢复民主地位而后已。指挥官们并驳斥希腊政府所称马其顿游击队获得南保或其他国家之外援的谰言。又据美联社讯：游击队副参谋长卡尔法（化名）谈称：游击队于十一月廿四日曾向苏美英三国政府提出备忘录，要求组织联合代表团，至游击区调查真相，卡尔法允予合作，并谓彼曾与各国记者在游击队后方考察三日，已将其结果向联合国机构秘书处提出详细报告。游击队已提出九项停战条件，此项条件如不接受，他们将继续抵抗反动政权。九项条件如下：一、大赦政治犯；二、英军为希腊一切罪恶之原因，应退出希腊；三、承认游击队战时之抗战功绩；四、抗战人员参加政府；五、民主分子与帝制派权利平等；六、惩罚沦陷时代附敌之法西斯分子；七、肃清军政附敌分子；八、组织切实代表国家之军队；九、重新选举。卡尔法对于所部实力如何并未宣布，仅称：每一处山头均为游击队控制，此说已由英军谍报证实。
    【新华社延安十二月二十九日电】据路透社莫斯科电称：苏联少共真理报评论希腊局势，指出：“好些有空军支持的希腊政府军队，都已证实无力与民主军队作战。其中一个原因是他们不愿与希腊爱国人士作战，而且不论官兵都宁愿参加对方。希政府军无力占得上风的另一个原因在于民主军获得广大人民的普遍拥护。”
