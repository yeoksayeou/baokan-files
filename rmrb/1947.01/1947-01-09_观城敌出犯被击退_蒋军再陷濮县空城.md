(This newspaper's front-line dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 7th) Chiang's Fifth Army, which has occupied the Guancheng area, has been sending small units to harass us with probing attacks in recent days. The 96th Division in Guancheng launched a two-pronged attack on the 5th, one force advancing to Machang northeast of the city, and the other to Huangzhu Temple. Under the attack of local soldiers and civilians, they fled back to Guancheng in disgrace that evening. The 45th Division, which had advanced from Wenmingzhai (south of Guancheng) and Guyunji (north of Puyang County) to Malanji (under Puyang County), also launched a two-pronged attack on the same day, one force passing through Yingtaoyuan, Qianhou Mazhuang, Gaozhuang, and reaching Gutingji (all northeast of Puyang County), and the other force reaching Baiyige and Liuhangtou. These two enemy forces also retreated back to Malanji that evening under the forceful attacks of our soldiers and civilians.

(This newspaper's front-line dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 7th) Chiang's 75th Division, which attacked eastward from Liuxiatun (west of Puyang County) at 4 p.m. on the 4th, occupied the city of Puyang County.
