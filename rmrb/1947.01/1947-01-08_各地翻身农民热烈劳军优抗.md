    [This Dispatch from Weixian, 3rd] The liberated peasants in various parts of Jinnan are actively carrying out New Year's activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of resistance fighters. The masses in Dongguan Town, the sixth district of Yuanchao, are voluntarily comforting the wounded soldiers with eggs, noodles, cigarettes, sesame cakes, etc. Villages in the fifth district of Wucheng launched a campaign to support the army, and within ten days, the masses in forty-seven villages donated more than 1.5 million yuan. The militia of Huzhuang wrote letters to the soldiers at the front to wish them a Happy New Year. Zhou Quanzhuang farmer members in the first district of Enxian donated the telescope they had obtained through struggle to the front lines. Criminals in the Xinxin Academy in Xiajin, deeply grateful for the leniency of the democratic government, donated 18,000 yuan earned from their labor to the front lines. Representatives of the militia company in Jingxian wrote a letter to the soldiers at the front lines on behalf of the entire county's armed forces to wish them a Happy New Year. The letter said: "You should kill the enemy well at the front, and we will train well here in the rear. Soon, we will go to the front to help you fight old Chiang." Women in Beitaiji Village, Weixian, made new cotton shoes and socks for the soldiers at the front, so that the soldiers could wear them for the New Year. Before the New Year, Shanyue Village in the fifth district of Yuanchao conducted a major inspection of preferential treatment to the families of resistance fighters and resolved the difficulties of housing for the families of martyrs and resistance fighters and honored soldiers.
