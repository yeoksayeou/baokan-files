[This article transmitted by] This Newspaper's Taiyue Dispatch on the 23rd: The land reform movement of taking up arms in one hand and carrying out liquidation in the other has begun in the spiderweb joint defense in Fushan. The masses in Zhuge, Nanwang, Libei, Qianjiao, Fanjiapo and other villages five miles north of the city, under the cover of militia joint defense, began to carry out the anti-traitor liquidation. After the news of the people's liquidation of the traitorous landlords Guo Zenggui in Nanwang Village, Ge Fengjia in Fanjiapo, and Zhou Mingfeng in Libei, reached the city, Chiang Kai-shek's troops, taking advantage of the Zhuge Village holding a liquidation meeting on the 25th of last month, suddenly attacked the village with 200 people in two routes. One route coordinated and covered from Yangjiapo to Laoniupo, and the other crossed the river to attack Zhuge Village. However, the spiderweb joint defense alarm sounded, and the masses of Zhuge Village first transferred in an organized manner. The militia groups deployed their positions and waited with guns to annihilate the enemy. After Chiang Kai-shek's troops entered the village, they shouted: "Landlords, rise up and settle accounts!" Before they finished speaking, they were shot dead by the militia with seven cold shots, killing seven people. The rest fled for their lives, and the militia groups took advantage of the victory to pursue and wound two more of them. When they retreated to the river beach, they stepped on stone mines, and with a bang, one of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers was torn to pieces. At the back of the Bai Village Temple, more than 50 enemies came to reinforce, but were intercepted and surrounded by the militias of Libei, Nanhuo, Nanwang, Anzili, and others. After two hours of fierce fighting, Chiang Kai-shek's troops were wounded six, unsupported, and retreated. On the 8th, when the masses of Nanwang and Libei gathered to distribute the fruits, the enemy harassed the city again. When they reached Nanhuo, they were met head-on by the sentry militia of Gou Dong and Nanwang villages, and turned to the ridge. Immediately, cold shots rang out from Gao Village, Zhuangli, Pingli, and others, and Chiang Kai-shek's troops retreated in panic. Libei continued to distribute the fruits as usual.

    浮山城郊人民坚决完成土地改革
    蛛网联防中展开清算
    民兵集团两次击溃蒋军进扰，掩护群众照常分果实。
    【本报太岳二十三日电】浮山蛛网联防中开始一手拿枪一手清算的土地改革运动。城北五里之诸葛、南王、历北、前交、范家坡等村群众在民兵联防掩护下，开始进行反奸清算。南王村汉奸地主郭增贵，范家坡葛逢甲，历北周鸣凤等，被群众清算的消息传至城内后，蒋军于上月二十五日，乘诸葛村正在开清算会时，突以二百人分两路进攻该村，一路从杨家坡至老牛坡策应掩护，一路过河向诸葛村进攻，但蛛网联防警报响起，诸葛村群众首光有组织的转移了，民兵集团布置阵地持枪等待着歼灭敌人。蒋军进村后高喊着：“地主起来倒算！”话音未落，即被民兵冷枪七发击毙七人，其余的便没命的逃跑，民兵集团乘胜追击又打伤他两人。待他们退到河滩，又踏响了石雷，霹雳一声一名蒋军血肉横飞，在柏村庙后，敌五十余名前来增援，又被历北、南霍、南王、安子里等民兵阻击与围击。激战两小时，蒋军伤六名不支而退。八日南王、历北群众集会分配果实时，敌人又出城袭扰，行至南霍，即被我沟东、南王村之岗哨民兵迎头痛击转向岭上，随即高村、庄里、平里等冷枪四起，蒋军怆惶而退，历北仍旧进行分配果实。
