    New Year Greetings
    Xiu Shan
    On the first day of the old lunar year, early in the morning, Mother Li dressed and looked out of the window mirror. The snow on the branches was already two inches thick, and the snow in the yard had been swept once, piled into two large heaps.

    Mother Li said to her daughter-in-law, who was stoking the fire, "With such heavy snow, no one will come to our house for New Year greetings. Let's wait a while before cooking the dumplings."

    Before Mother Li finished speaking, the sound of gongs and drums echoed noisily from the street. She muttered to herself, "Young people just love to play. The snow can't stop them from having fun." Turning to her daughter-in-law, she said, "With the snow falling, who would go to watch? They don't feel the cold even with the lively celebrations!"

    The gongs and drums grew louder and closer, closer, closer, until they reached the gate. Mother Li hurriedly got off the bed, preparing to stand at the door and take a look. Before she could put on her shoes, the gongs and drums had entered the gate with a "Dong Dong Long Long Qiang!" The gongs and drums stopped, and the village chief shouted, "Mother, Mother, come out quickly! Comrades are here to give you New Year greetings!"

    Mother Li walked out of the house and stood under the eaves. She saw the yard was already full of people, and more were still coming in through the gate. The old lady didn't know what to do, she just smiled, smiling so hard she couldn't close her mouth. Mother Li's yard was not small to begin with, and her son often brought a group of people to aim in the yard when he was a militia member in the village, but today the yard seemed too small.

    A female comrade stepped forward and took Mother Li's hand, saying, "All the comrades from our organization have come to give you New Year greetings because your son joined the Eighth Route Army." As soon as the female comrade finished speaking, someone in the yard shouted, "Attention, hats off, bow!" and everyone acted accordingly. Mother Li didn't know how to respond. Bowing was not something she was used to and didn't know how, and kowtowing, she was afraid the comrades would laugh at her. In extreme confusion, Mother Li grabbed her hands and made a gesture of cupping one fist in the other, causing the children in the village who came to watch the spectacle to burst into laughter.

    After the New Year greetings, a comrade took out a large red invitation card, which read: "We humbly invite you to a simple meal on the second day of the old lunar year." Below were the names of Yang Xiufeng and Rong Wusheng, and next to it was added: "The banquet will be held at the village primary school." Mother Li couldn't read, but she heard "simple meal" and "banquet," so she understood that they were inviting her to eat. She looked back, remembered something, and retreated three steps back into the house. She took out a small bag from inside, "I don't have anything, just a few walnuts for each person." By this time, the gongs and drums had already started, and everyone was already moving backwards. Mother Li grabbed the female comrade at the very end and said anxiously, "If you don't eat walnuts, I'll feel bad. Write me a letter and tell my son not to worry about home. I ate meat dumplings for the New Year, and I also got my share of the fruit. With such heavy snow, you comrades still came to give New Year greetings..."

    The female comrade asked Mother Li, "You told him not to worry about home, don't you miss him?" Mother Li said frankly, "He just left, I shouldn't miss him, but later—" Speaking of this, she pointed her hand at her daughter-in-law, "Later, the young people don't miss him, so I don't miss him either."

    Mother Li still wanted the female comrade to eat dumplings, but the female comrade said, "There are more than fifty families of military dependents in the village. We have to visit each one. We'll come again another day!"

    拜年
    秀山
    旧历正月初一清早，李大娘穿好衣裳，从窗户镜子里往外一看，树枝上的雪已经二寸厚，院子里的雪已经有人扫过一遍，堆成那么两大堆。
    李大娘对着正在烧火的儿媳妇说：“下了这么大的雪没人来咱家拜年，等一回再煮饺子吧”。
    李大娘的话没落地，街里锣鼓铿铿锵锵的闹起来，她自言自语的“年轻人就爱耍，下雪也挡不住他们闹红火”，回头对着媳妇说：“下着雪，谁去看，闹红火也不觉冷！”
    锣鼓越响越近，越近，越近，已经到了大门口，李大娘急忙从炕上下来，准备站在门口瞧一眼，还没穿好鞋，锣鼓已经进了大门，“咚咚隆隆锵”，锣鼓一停，村长喊起来“大娘大娘快出来，同志们来给你拜年来了”！
    李大娘从屋里走出来，站到房檐下，只见：院子已经站满了人，门口里还继续向里进，她老人家不知如何好，只是笑，笑的闭不住嘴。李大娘的院子本来不小，他的孩子在村当民兵时，常常带着一伙人在院里瞄准，可是今天却显得院子太小了。
    一个女同志上前拉住李大娘的手说：“我们机关全体同志，来给你拜年，因为你的孩子参加八路军。”女同志的话刚说完，院里的人由一个人喊“立正，脱帽，鞠躬”大家动作起来。李大娘不知该怎样对付，鞠躬吧，不习惯也不会，叩头吧，又怕同志们笑话；在极端忙乱里，李大娘把两手一抓一拉，作了个揖，惹的村里看稀罕的小孩们一场哈哈大笑。
    拜了年，一个同志拿出了一张大红帖子，上面写着：“谨订于旧历元月初二日略备便饭、敬候光临”，下面写着杨秀峰、戎伍胜的名字，旁边还加着“席设本村小学校”。李大娘不认字，只听到“便饭”和“席设”，他就明白这是请她吃饭，他把头向后一看，想起什么一样，三步两步退回屋里，从里边取出了一个小口袋，“我没有什么东西，每人吃几个核桃”。此时锣鼓已响，大家都已经身子向后了，李老太太着急的，一把手拉住最后边的女同志说：“你们不吃核桃，我心里过不去。你给我写一封信，告诉我那孩子，叫他不用想家，我过年吃肉饺子，又分了果实，下这么大的雪，你们同志又来拜年……”。
    女同志问李大娘，“你告他不想家，你想他不想？”李大娘坦然的说：“他刚走了，该不是想哩，后来——”说到道里他的手指向媳妇：“后来年轻人都不想，我也就不想了”。
    李大娘还要让女同志吃饺子，女同志说：“村里五十多家抗属哩，我们一户一户都要去，改日再来！”
