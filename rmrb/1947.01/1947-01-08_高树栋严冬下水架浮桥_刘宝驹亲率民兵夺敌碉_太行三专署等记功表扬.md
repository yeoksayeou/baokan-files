　　Gao Shudong Bravely Plunges into Icy River to Build Pontoon Bridge
　　Liu Baoju Personally Leads Militia to Seize Enemy Bunker
　　Taihang Third Administrative Office Commends and Praises Them

　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Taihang Third Administrative Office and the Third Military Subdistrict commended Gao Shudong and Liu Baoju, who made meritorious contributions in the Lucun battle in Linxian County, and issued a circular to the district's armed forces to learn from them. Comrade Gao Shudong is the Director of the Linxian County Military Committee. Before the Lucun battle (on the 9th of last month), our army's unit × arrived at Shaogongyan Village. When crossing the Qi River, there was only a small wooden bridge. If the troops relied solely on the small wooden bridge, it might delay military operations. Comrade Gao arrived at this time and first took off his clothes and went into the river to test the water level and arrange the bridge construction. The militia he led were greatly moved and quickly jumped into the water with their clothes on to build the bridge. Two wide wooden plank bridges were built in an instant, and the troops crossed immediately, completing the combat mission. Furthermore, Liu Baoju, instructor of the Sixth District Military Committee of Linxian County, personally led a company of militia in the Lucun battle to cooperate with our unit × in attacking the Xilucun bunker. Under the enemy's seven machine guns, the entire company of militia bravely advanced with bare shoulders, and after killing or wounding seven enemies, the bunker was captured. Comrade Liu and others then killed one enemy in the pursuit and seized three warhorses and a batch of military supplies. In addition to awarding the Sixth District Militia 5,000 yuan in local currency, the Third Administrative Office and the Third Military Subdistrict awarded Comrade Gao Shudong and Comrade Liu Baoju each with one merit, and issued a circular to the district's armed forces to learn from their exemplary and heroic spirit.
