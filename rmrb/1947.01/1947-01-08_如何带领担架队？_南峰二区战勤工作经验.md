The following are the experiences of the Second District of Nanfeng in leading stretcher teams: (1) Strict organization and appropriate allocation of district and village cadres. Organizationally, the district is the company, three groups form a platoon, five stretchers form a team, and one stretcher forms a squad. The organization is small and easy to manage. The company and platoon each have a commander and deputy commander, who are district cadres; the team and squad each have a team leader and deputy team leader, who are junior district cadres and good village cadres; each platoon has a quartermaster to ensure timely supply of firewood and grain; the company has two or three doctors carrying Chinese and Western medicine. (2) Clear rewards and punishments; the good are rewarded, and deserters are criticized. During the Juye Campaign, only one stretcher team out of a hundred deserted. Some people said, "This stretcher team is a disgrace to the Second District. We must ask them to pay back the debt when they return." After returning, the masses criticized them at a meeting, and in the second phase, they were asked to carry again. As a result, desertions disappeared. The good ones were praised and rewarded. In the Western Front Campaign, the Second District was a model and received a bonus of 4,000 yuan from the county headquarters, which further boosted morale. (3) Seize the opportunity to educate people about cherishing the wounded. After carrying out education on cherishing the wounded, when the district sent out stretcher teams for the second phase, the stretcher bearers often covered the wounded with quilts and even, like Li Heyin of Bada Village, put the wounded's head on his lap and fed them very sincerely. Everyone considered Li Heyin to be a model of cherishing the wounded.

    如何带领担架队？
    ——南峰二区战勤工作经验
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】南峰二区带领担架队的点滴经验如下：（一）组织严密，适当的配备区村干部。在组织上以区为中队，三个组为一排，五付担架为一小组，一付担架为一班。组织短小，便于领导掌握。中队和排均设正副队长，由区干部担任；小组和班设正副组长，小区干部和好的村干担任；每排设事务长一人，保证柴粮及时的供给；中队设医生二、三人，携带中西药品。（二）赏罚严明，好的得到奖赏，逃跑分子受到批评。在鄄城战役时，百付担架中只跑了一付，有些群众说：“这付担架真给二区丢人，回去一定叫他还账。”回来后，群众在大会上给他提了意见，到了第二期又叫他去抬。于是逃跑现象没有了。好的则受到表扬奖赏。在西线战役中，二区是模范，得到县指挥部奖金四千元，后来更有了劲。（三）抓紧时机，进行爱护彩号的教育。经进行爱护彩号教育后，该区在出第二期担架时，担架队员就经常给彩号盖被子，甚至如八大庄李和银把彩号的头放到自己的腿上，很诚意的喂饭，大家都认为李和银是爱护彩号的模范。
