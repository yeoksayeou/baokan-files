　　U.S. Supports Reactionaries, Plots to Disrupt Polish Parliamentary Elections
    Pravda Observer Writes
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] TASS, Moscow, January 13th: Regarding the Polish parliamentary elections to be held on January 19th, a Pravda observer recently wrote: The election law promulgated by the Polish government grants residents the broadest possible opportunity to freely express their will. It should be pointed out that under this law, not only political parties but any adult citizen can nominate candidates. However, in a note to the Polish government on January 9th, the U.S. government felt it necessary to condemn the Polish authorities for violating the Yalta and Potsdam agreements regarding free and unimpeded elections in Poland. The U.S. note saw such "violations" in the Polish government's arrest of "democratic elements" from "groups" not recognized as parties. But who are these "democratic elements" that the U.S. note is attempting to protect? As everyone knows, they are the Peasant Party and its leader, Mikołajczyk.
    The person providing information for foreign interference in Poland's internal affairs is none other than Mikołajczyk. At a press conference with foreign journalists, Mikołajczyk vehemently defended his party's alleged "persecution." Foreseeing the inevitable failure in the elections, he opposed the election campaign in advance. But if his party freely nominated its candidates, what can he complain about? He protests the arrest of some of his party members, but as is well known, the Polish authorities do not arrest people simply for being members of Mikołajczyk's party. They are arrested and publicly tried only for espionage, banditry, assassinating democratic leaders, and having connections with underground fascists.
    The developments of the past few days have even more clearly demonstrated the true nature of the Peasant Party and Mikołajczyk's actions. Security organs captured the headquarters of an underground fascist organization and discovered its "leadership's" connection with Mikołajczyk. One of the documents obtained revealed that terrorists informed Mikołajczyk of plans to disrupt the elections "so that the provisional government cannot consolidate its position." The publication of these documents has caused chaos within the Peasant Party. The Polish people are uniting behind the democratic bloc, calmly and confidently preparing for elections, elections that will further consolidate and enhance the achievements of young Polish democracy.

　　美国支持反动分子  图破坏波国会选举
    真理报观察家为文指出
    【本报讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：关于波兰即将于一月十九日举行的国会选举，真理报观察家顷著文称：波政府所颁布之选举法给予居民自由表现其意志之最广泛的可能。应当指出，在此法律下，不仅各政党而且由何成年公民都可推选其候选人。然而美国政府在一月九日致波政府的照会中，竟觉得有必要谴责波当局违反雅尔达和波茨坦会议，关于波兰举行自由无碍选举的决定，在波政府对于未被承认为党派“集团”之“民主分子”所进行的逮捕行动中，美照会竟看出了此种“违反”。然美照会所企图保护的这些“民主分子”是些什么人呢？众所周知，是农民党和其领袖米柯拉兹科。
    提供外国干涉波兰内政资料的人，不是别人，就是米柯拉兹科，米氏于外国记者招待会中，力辩彼党所受之“迫害”，他预见在选举中不可避免的失败，乃于事前反对选举运动之进行。但是，假如他的党自由地推选了其候选人，他还可以抱怨什么呢！他抗议逮捕其党中的某些党员，然而如所熟知，波兰当局并不以具有米柯拉兹科党党籍之事实而逮捕人民，彼等仅因间谍及土匪行为和暗杀民主领袖，与地下法西斯联系而被逮捕和公审。
    过去数日之发展，更清晰的说明了农民党的真实性质及米氏之行为。治安机关捕获了法西斯地下总部，并发现其“领导”与米氏之间的联系，所获文件中之一，已发现了恐怖主义者通知米氏破坏选举，“俾使临时政府不能巩固其地位”；这些文件之发表，已引起农民党之混乱。波兰人民正团结在民主集团之后，镇定而自信的准备选举，选举是为更进一步巩固和增进年青的波兰民主之成就。
