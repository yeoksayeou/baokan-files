[From Our Newspaper in Weixian, January 17th] Farmers in Fenzhang Village, Wuyi County, are prospering by leaching salt. Dong and Xi (East and West) Fenzhang Villages were impoverished villages where most of the land was unsuitable for growing crops, and the masses relied mainly on leaching salt for a living. Before the incident (likely referring to the period before the Communist takeover), Kuomintang salt affairs teams monitored the masses and prohibited salt leaching, forcing them to suffer from hunger and cold. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, salt leaching increased again with the advocacy and assistance of the democratic government, which solved some of the problems of livelihood. After the Japanese surrender, farmers obtained gains in the mass movement and had capital for salt leaching. Du Jingshui of Fenzhang Village said, "In the past, several poor families in our village had no food or clothing and could not even afford to leach a little salt. Now that we have land and money, we can leach salt with peace of mind." The area of land suitable for salt production in Dong and Xi Fenzhang Villages is eighteen *qing*, and the area currently used for salt leaching is about 2 *qing* and 30 *mu*, with 88 *qing* of salt ponds and 181 young and middle-aged people participating in salt leaching. Last year, a total of 253,000 *jin* of salt was produced. In the two years from 1945 to 1946, Dong Fenzhang Village increased its livestock by 50 head due to salt leaching production, and many former poor peasants rose to become middle or wealthy middle peasants. Wu Panlong added 10 *mu* of land, Zhang Fugui added 20 *mu* of land, and Du Jingshui added 4 *mu* of land. Many poor young people have married wives, and they happily call the salt leaching land "wife-scraping" land.

　　东西粉张年产盐二十多万斤
    大量买地买牲口
    【本报威县十七日电】武邑粉张村农民淋盐致富。东、西粉张村，是贫苦村，大部土地不长庄稼，群众主要依靠淋盐为生。事变前有国民党的盐务队监视群众，禁止淋盐，只得挨饥受冻。抗战中在民主政府提倡帮助下淋盐的才又多起来了。解决了部分生活困难。日本投降后，群运中农民分得果实，有了淋盐资本，粉张村杜景水说：“过去，我村几家贫农没吃没穿，连小盐也淋不起，现在有了地，有了钱，还能安心的淋盐。”东西粉张村能出盐的地有十八顷，现在淋盐地约占二顷三十亩，有盐池八十八顷，参加淋盐的青壮年一百八十一人。去年一共产盐二十五万三千斤。一九四五年到一九四六年二年当中，东粉张村因淋盐生产，全村增加牲口五十头，好些赤农上升为中农或富裕中农。吴盘龙添地十亩，张福贵添地二十亩，杜景水添地四亩。好多贫苦青壮年娶了老婆，他们高兴的把淋盐土叫“刮老婆”。
