Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. Liberation Daily published a commentary on the 4th regarding Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day speech, deeming Chiang's speech a "desperate plea from a dying man," the "greatest slander" against "the nation's workers, youth, and all the people," and unleashed "poisonous arrows" at the CCP. Regarding Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "policy of maintaining peace and unity," and "consistently adhering to the policy of resolving political issues through political means," the commentary cited the fact that Chiang had destroyed the January Truce Order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference over the past year, especially the recent large-scale offensive by Chiang's troops against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, to illustrate that it was "thoroughly and completely false." As for the dark and corrupt phenomena in Chiang Kai-shek's ruling area, such as "moral decay," "extravagance and luxury," and "seizing by trickery and robbery," he shamelessly tried to shirk the responsibility for creating these evils, claiming they were the result of "old remnants" and the impact of "ceaseless internal strife." He harshly insulted the meritorious working class and the national industrialists who were on the verge of death under American aggression. "But the root of these evils is precisely the reactionary rule of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families headed by Chiang Kai-shek himself." Finally, in his speech, Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, had to admit that the youth in his ruling area were "in a state of worry and indignation," while on the other hand, he said that the youth were too demanding of reality and "easily incited and manipulated by political careerists with ulterior motives." Regarding the patriotic enthusiasm of the youth, such as the just movement of students in Peiping, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai against the rape of a Peking University female student by American soldiers, he slandered and sabotaged it in the same way. The commentary pointed out that this was Chiang Kai-shek's old trick of deceiving and oppressing the youth for more than a decade, but the Chinese people will definitely not be deceived or intimidated.

    日暮途穷的呼吁
    解放日报评蒋介石元旦演说
    【新华社延安六日电】解放日报四日对蒋介石元旦演说发表评论，认为蒋之演说是“日暮途穷的呼吁”，是对“全国工人青年和全体人民”的“最大的污蔑”，而且对于中共则尽情的“放射恶毒的箭”。对于蒋介石所谓“维护和平统一的方针”，以及“一秉以政治方式解决政治问题之方针”，该评论举出蒋一年来破坏一月停战令与政协决议之事实，尤其最近蒋军向陕甘宁边区之大举进攻，以说明其是“彻头彻尾是假的”。至于蒋介石对其统治区黑暗腐败的现象，如“道德沦丧”、“穷奢极欲”、“巧取豪夺”等，他想把造成这些罪恶的责任厚颜无耻的推开，说什么“旧的残留”，又说什么“内乱不止”的影响。他对于劳苦功高的劳工阶级和在美国侵略下奄奄一息的民族工业家，狠狠的辱骂了一通。“但这些罪恶的根源，正是蒋介石为首的蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族反动统治的自身。最后，蒋介石演说中对于其统治区内的青年，一面不能不承认“处于烦愁愤慨之中”，一面又说青年对现实过于苛求，“容易被别有作用的政治野心家所煽惑操纵”。对于青年的爱国热情，如平、津、京、沪、学生反对美军强奸北大女生这样天经地义的正义运动，一样加以污蔑破坏。该评论指出这是蒋介石十几年来欺骗青年、压迫青年的老一套，但中国人民是决然骗不了、吓不倒的。
