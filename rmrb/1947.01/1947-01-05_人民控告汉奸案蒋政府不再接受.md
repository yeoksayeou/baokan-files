　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. According to a French news agency dispatch of the 30th: The Nanjing Kuomintang Supreme Council has decided to end its "suppression" of traitor activities and cease accepting traitor cases brought forward by individuals or organizations. It has been over a year, and under the pressure of the broad masses of the people, the Kuomintang authorities have only punished a mere handful of traitors. The vast majority of traitors and national criminals still roam free, and even enjoy preferential treatment from the Kuomintang government.

　　人民控告汉奸案蒋政府不再接受
    【新华社延安二日电】据法国新闻社三十日消息：南京国民党最高会议已决定结束其“肃清”汉奸工作，停止接受个人或社团提出的汉奸案。按一年多来国民党当局在广大人民压力下，仅惩办了寥寥可数的几个汉奸，绝大多数的汉奸国贼仍逍遥法外，甚至享受着国民党政府的优渥待遇。
