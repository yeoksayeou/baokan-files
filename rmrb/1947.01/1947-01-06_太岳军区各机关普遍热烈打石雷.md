    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] In recent days, the sound of thunder has been booming around Yangcheng. The stone mine practice movement has spread to the directly subordinate organs of the District Party Committee and the Military Region. While making mines, the District Party Committee organs also conduct experiments. The enthusiasm of the messengers and guards for making stone mines is particularly high; they experiment with explosions after making them. Wang Dezheng, the squad leader of the Xing Shu (Administrative Office) guard squad, patiently and meticulously passed on his skills to others everywhere after returning from Wu Zong (military headquarters) where he had learned to make stone mines. Comrades Ren Changxin and Lin Tianxing completed four stone mines in seven days (excluding office hours). Their slogan is: "Rather let people rest than let the hammer rest!" The entire office has completed ninety-three mines. Guests in the reception room also voluntarily make stone mines. The Jinan Bank has completed twenty. Wang Mei, a female cadre of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, makes stone mines that are both deep and large, and is known as a model mine maker. Currently, various organs have made ××× mines.
