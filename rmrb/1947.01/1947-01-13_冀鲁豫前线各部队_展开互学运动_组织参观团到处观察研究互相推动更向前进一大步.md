Jilu Yu Frontline Troops
    Launch Mutual Learning Campaign
    Organize Visiting Groups to Observe and Study Everywhere, Promoting Each Other to Take a Big Step Forward
    [This newspaper's Jilu Yu Frontline, 11th dispatch] The field armies on the Jilu Yu Frontline, and the units under each army, have launched a heated mutual learning movement. Since the Patriotic Self-Defense War, each army and unit has made rapid progress, while maintaining its own unique characteristics. Through the commendation and assistance of the military region leaders, and the organization of visiting groups to learn from each other, they are jointly promoted to take a big step forward. The participants in the visiting groups are all important responsible cadres or heads of units, and they make full ideological preparations beforehand, not only treating the visit as a fresh, relaxing and enjoyable work, but also as a difficult and arduous task. Therefore, during the visit, they are all intensely observing, researching, and criticizing, and upon returning, they report to the cadres and soldiers or compile the information into a more systematic material, which is compiled, printed and published. One visiting group was out for seventeen days, but did not rest for even half a day, even busier than during combat. The method adopted by one visiting group was: "Only look at the advantages and ignore the disadvantages, and record the facts and pursue the root causes when discovering an advantage." Deputy Political Commissar Gao of a certain brigade wrote an article entitled "Zhuge Liang Meeting," introducing a lively meeting form in the unit he visited, which gathered the wisdom of the soldiers. This kind of "Zhuge Liang Meeting" is very common in the various companies of that unit; many newly liberated soldiers often speak boldly and enthusiastically at this kind of unrestrained meeting, reporting many details of the Chiang army's tactics, so as to jointly study countermeasures. The communication and reporting work of a certain unit has been greatly improved after the visiting group returned, because the visiting group saw that the communication and reporting work of another unit was of great help to the overall work, and even if the newspaper was not published or published late, the cadres and soldiers would automatically inquire to the political organs, requesting rapid publication. When a certain unit visited, it saw that another unit had handed in all the livestock that should be handed in within two hours after the order arrived. Therefore, they deeply felt that the execution of orders in their own unit should be more thorough and rapid. A certain unit summarized the post-war company political work as "reorganizing the organization, comforting the wounded, communication and reporting, and electing models." And the work plan, decision, and instructions all have a clause after the meeting "Check on × day, summarize on × day, × (who) is responsible for conveying and executing", this kind of clear and practical style has also been universally adopted by other troops through mutual visits.

　　冀鲁豫前线各部队
    展开互学运动
    组织参观团到处观察研究互相推动更向前进一大步
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十一日电】冀鲁豫前线野战军各部之间、各部所属各单位之间已展开热烈的互学运动。各部各单位自爱国自卫战争以来，均有飞速进步，而又各自保持其不同的特色。经过军区首长表扬、帮助与组织参观团互相学习，就推动着共同更向前进一大步。参加参观团的均系重要负责干部或各单位首长，并在事前作充分思想准备，不仅把参观当作新鲜的轻松愉快的工作，而且当作困难吃力的功课。因而参观中都是紧张地到处观察，研究批评，回来向干部战士报告或整理成比较有系统的材料，编印发表。某部参观团出去了十七日，但是半天也没有休息，比作战时还忙。某部参观团采用的方法是：光看优点不管缺点，发现一个优点就记明事实，追求根源。”某旅高副政委写了一篇题为《诸葛亮会》的文章，介绍他参观的那个部队集中战士智慧的一种生动活泼的会议形式。这种“诸葛亮会”在那个部队的各个连队都很普遍；许多新解放的战士常常在这种不受拘束的会议上兴致勃勃地大胆发言，报告许多蒋军战术上的细节，以便共同研究对付办法。某部通讯报导工作在参观团回来后大有改进，因为参观团看到另一部队的通讯报导工作对整个工作的帮助极大，甚至不出报或报出得迟，干部战士都自动向政治机关询问，要求迅速出版。某部参观时看到另一部分在命令到达后两个钟头，应交上来的牲口就都交齐了。于是深感本单位执行命令应更求彻底与迅速。某部把战后连队政治工作归纳为“整理组织，慰问伤员，通讯报导，选举模范。”并且工作计划、决定、指示，会后都有一条“×日检查，×日总结，×（谁）负责传达执行”，此种明确切实的作风也经过互相参观，普遍到别的部队去了。
