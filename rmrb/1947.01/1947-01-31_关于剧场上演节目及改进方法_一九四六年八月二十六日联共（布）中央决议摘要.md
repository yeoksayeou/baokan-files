After reviewing the issue of theater performance programs and their improvement methods, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) believes that the arrangement of theater performance programs is unsatisfactory.

The main shortcoming of the current state of theater performance programs is that plays by Soviet writers with contemporary themes have been virtually excluded from the performance programs of the largest theaters in the country. Among the twenty dramas performed at the Moscow Art Theater, only three are about contemporary Soviet life. There are three out of twenty plays at the Maly Theater, three out of nine at the Moscow Soviet Theater, two out of ten at the Vakhtangov Theater, three out of eleven at the Kamerny Theater, two out of ten at the Leningrad Pushkin Theater, three out of eleven at the Kiev Franko Theater, two out of eleven at the Kharkov Shevchenko Theater, and only five out of seventeen plays performed at the Sverdlovsk Theater are about contemporary Soviet issues.

The obviously abnormal phenomenon of performance programs is being intensified, because even among the few contemporary-themed plays that have been performed, some are weak and lack ideological depth (Vodopyanov's "Forced Landing," the Tur Brothers' "Birthday," Rybak and Savchenko's "Airplane Delayed by 24 Hours," A. Gladkov's "New Year's Eve," the Tur Brothers' "Extraordinary Law," Rakhmanov and Rice's "Forest Ranger," Bogokin's "Female Boatman," and several others). In these plays, Soviet people are depicted in ugly caricatures, as backward and lacking culture, with vulgar tastes and morals; while the characters of the antagonists are given particularly clear outlines, portrayed as powerful, willful, and experienced. The stories depicted in this type of play are often fabricated and false, thus creating an incorrect and distorted representation of Soviet life. Most of the contemporary-themed plays performed in theaters are unartistic and childish, written very roughly and without literary merit, and their authors lack sufficient knowledge of Russian literature and the people's language. At the same time, many theaters are irresponsible in performing dramas about Soviet life. Theater leaders often assign these dramas to secondary directors, resulting in a gamble by weak and inexperienced actors, without paying necessary attention to the artistic form of the performance, thus making the performance of contemporary-themed scripts dull and lacking artistry. All of this proves that many theaters have not taken on the task of cultivating culture and promoting progressive Soviet ideas and morals. This situation of theater performance programs is not fulfilling the educational interests of the workers and should not be tolerated in Soviet theaters. (The following two paragraphs are a synthesis of several key points from the resolution. - Editor)

The biggest shortcomings of the Arts Affairs Committee and many theater workers are their excessive enthusiasm for performing classical dramas, in which there is no historical or educational significance, but only idealized depictions of the lives of emperors and nobles; on the other hand, the most inferior and vulgar foreign bourgeois plays are also brought to the Soviet stage, promoting reactionary bourgeois ideas and morals to the Soviet people and attempting to infringe upon the consciousness of the Soviet people. The Arts Affairs Committee's failure to pay close attention to and lead the work of performance programs, allowing it to drift, is a major political error.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) believes that the main reason for the many shortcomings in theater performance programs is the unsatisfactory work of playwrights. Many playwrights are divorced from the fundamental issues of modern life, do not understand the lives and problems of the people, and cannot depict the excellent characteristics and qualities of the Soviet people. Another reason is the lack of principled dramatic criticism. Therefore, they dare not boldly support good scripts, but condone those mediocre and poisonous performances.

After reviewing these errors and their roots, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) decided:

1. Comrade Khrapchenko, Chairman of the Arts Affairs Committee, is responsible for eradicating the serious shortcomings and errors pointed out in this resolution within the shortest possible time.

2. Considering the importance of theaters in carrying out communist education for the people, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) orders the Arts Affairs Committee and the Standing Committee of the Soviet Writers' Association to focus on the arrangement of Soviet modern performance programs.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) puts forward a task for playwrights and theater workers - to create works that are particularly clear in artistic attitude and full of value, depicting the life of Soviet society and the Soviet people. Playwrights and theaters should show in their scripts and performances that Soviet social life is constantly moving forward, that everything is developing towards the excellent aspects of the Soviet people's temperament, and that they are moving forward with the strength shown during the Great Patriotic War. Calling on our playwrights and directors to actively participate in the education of the Soviet people, to answer their questions with a high level of culture, and to educate Soviet youth to be lively, optimistic, loyal to the motherland, and confident in the victory of our cause, unafraid of any obstacles, and good at overcoming all difficulties. At the same time, it calls on Soviet theaters to show that these qualities are not only present in individual selected people or heroes, but in tens of millions of Soviet people.

It is necessary to make all writers who are good at creating dramatic works actively and creatively participate in the specific work of arranging theater performance programs with qualities suitable for modern audiences.

3. The Arts Affairs Committee must undertake the basic practical task of organizing the performance of at least two or three new plays with modern Soviet themes in each theater every year that are of superior quality in terms of thought and art.

Theaters must fundamentally improve the quality of performing modern Soviet scripts, and for the performance of these scripts, they must select excellent directors and actors to make the artistic form of the performance of superior quality.

4. It is recommended that the Arts Affairs Committee remove ideologically empty and unartistic scripts from the performance program. It is necessary to constantly monitor to prevent erroneous, empty, unthinking, and worthless works from invading theaters.

5. It should be recognized the important task of criticism for the development of dramatic art. The editorial boards of "Pravda," "Izvestia," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," "Trud," "Soviet Art News," and "Literary Gazette" should pay attention to publishing critical articles with mature political views, dramatic and literary cultivation in newspapers. Systematically publish articles on new scripts and performances, and resolutely fight against the tendency of dramatic criticism to deviate from politics and be ideologically empty.

The editorial boards of newspapers in various republics, border areas, and states must systematically publish essays and criticisms on new theatrical performances in local theaters.

6. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out that the serious obstacle to promoting Soviet scripts in theaters is that there are too many judges and individuals who have the right to delete and approve the publication of scripts and the issue of performances in theaters. The Arts Administration Bureaus in various places, the Performance Program Association of the Arts Affairs Committees of various republics, the General Administration of Drama of the Arts Affairs Committee, the Arts Council of the committee, theater leaders, and staff of editorial and publishing houses are all engaged in reviewing scripts, which causes harmful delays and irresponsibility, and hinders the rapid advancement of scripts to the theater stage.

It is recommended to the Arts Affairs Committee to eliminate all obstacles that hinder the development, dissemination, and performance of scripts by Soviet playwrights in theaters, and the judges engaged in reviewing scripts should be reduced to a minimum. Comrade Khrapchenko will personally take responsibility for ensuring that the scripts written by Soviet playwrights are reviewed promptly and quickly within the committee.

7. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) confirmed that the Arts Council of the Arts Affairs Committee has failed to complete its task in improving the quality of performance programs and raising their ideological and artistic standards, leading the work in a conservative manner. As a result, it has not become a performance of the broad society in the theatrical world and has not been reflected in the newspapers.

The Arts Affairs Committee must seriously improve the work of the Arts Council. At the meetings of the Arts Council, implement critical analysis of new scripts and theatrical performances. The working materials of the Arts Council are published in "Soviet Art News".

8. The Arts Affairs Committee is allowed to organize a nationwide award competition for modern outstanding Soviet scripts in 1946-1947 in conjunction with the Standing Committee of the Soviet Writers' Association.

9. Considering the very narrow limitations of the performance programs of theaters in various counties, states, and autonomous republics, and the local playwrights' infatuation with the distant past, the Arts Affairs Committee must take measures to translate the excellent scripts of Soviet playwrights into the languages of various Soviet nationalities, and at the same time include them in the performance programs of theaters in various republics.

10. The Arts Affairs Committee is appointed to convene a meeting of playwrights and theater workers this autumn in conjunction with the Council of the Soviet Writers' Association to discuss the issue of performance programs and the joint creative work of playwrights and theaters.

    关于剧场上演节目及改进方法
    一九四六年八月二十六日联共（布）中央决议摘要
    检讨了剧场的上演节目及其改进方法问题以后，联共（布）中央认为剧场上演节目的编排，不能使人满意。
    剧场上演节目在现状上的主要缺点，乃是以现时为主题的苏联作家的剧本，实际上已从全国最大剧场的上演节目里被排挤出去了。在莫斯科艺术戏院所上演的二十部戏剧中，仅仅有三部是关于苏联现代生活问题的。在小戏院二十部戏中有三部，在莫市苏维埃戏院九部中有三，在瓦赫丹高夫戏院十部有二，在卡梅尔奈十一部有三，在列宁格勒普希金戏院十部有二，在基辅佛朗克剧场十一部有三，在哈尔果夫谢甫琴科戏院十一部有二，在斯维尔得洛夫剧场上演的十七部剧中仅有五部是关于现代苏联问题的。
    上演节目显然不正常的现象，越法在强化着了，因为在那少数经戏场演出过的以现代为主题的剧本中，还包含着些缺乏力量的，缺乏思想的剧本（窝多皮亚诺夫的“被迫的降落”、徒尔兄弟的“生日”、雷巴克萨甫琴科的“飞机迟误一昼夜”、Ａ·格拉得科夫的“新年之夜”、徒尔兄弟的“非常法律”、拉赫曼诺夫与雷斯的“林中宪”、勃高金的“女船手”、及其他数部）。在这些剧本里把苏联人们描绘成丑陋的漫画形式，落伍而又缺少文化，具有庸俗的趣味和道德，已经成了规律；而对于反派人物的性格却赋与了特别明朗的轮廓，表现得有力、有意志，而且很有经验。在这一类的剧本里，所描写的故事，经常是捏造和虚伪的，因此这些剧本就把苏联生活造成了不正确、歪曲的表现。大部分在剧场里上演过的现代主题剧本，都是违反艺术和幼稚的，写的非常粗率和没有文系，并且它们的作者们对于俄国文学和人民语言也都缺少足够的知识。同时有许多剧场对于上演苏联生活的戏剧不负责任。剧场的领导人员们时常把这些戏剧派给次要的导演们导演，造成一场能力薄弱和没有经验的演员们的赌博，对于演出的艺术形式一点也不加以必要的注意，因而现代主题的脚本的上演便形成了灰暗而又缺乏艺术性。这一切都证明了许多剧场并没有担任了培养文化，进步的苏联思想和道德的工作。剧场上演节目的这种情势，就是没有能为劳动者们的教育利益，而负起责任，而且是不应被容于苏联剧场的。  （以下两段是决议中几段要义的综合。——编者）
    艺术工作委员会及许多剧场工作的最大缺点，乃是它们过于热心上演古典题材的戏剧，而在这些剧本里没有丝毫历史和教育意义，只是理想的描写皇帝和贵族们的生活；另一方面，把那些最劣等的最下流的外国资产阶级的剧本也搬上了苏联的舞台，在苏联人民面前宣传着反动的资产阶级的思想和道德，企图侵害苏联人民的意识。艺术工作委员会没有在上演节目上很好的注意，并领导起这个工作而任其自流，是最大的政治错误。
    联共（布）中央认为：剧场上演节目诸多缺点的主要原因，乃是剧作家们不能使人满意的工作。许多剧作家脱离开了现代生活的根本问题，不明白人民的生活和问题，不会描写苏联人民的优秀特征和品质。另一个原因则是缺乏原则性的戏剧批评。因此，对于好的剧本既不敢大胆拥护，而对于那些平庸的，有毒的演出，反给以姑息。
    联共（布）中央在检讨出这些错误及其根源以后，决定：
    一、艺术工作委员会主席赫拉普琴科同志，负责在最短期间内，根除本决议中所指出的严重缺点及错误。
    二、联共（布）中央考虑到剧场在实行对人民的共产主义教育工作的重要性，命令艺术工作委员会及苏联作家协会常务委员会对于苏联现代的上演节目的编排应集中注意。
    联共（布）中央对剧作家和戏剧工作者提出了一个任务——创造在艺术态度上特别明朗的和充满价值的，描写苏维埃社会生活和苏维埃人民的作品。剧作家和剧场应该在剧本里和演出上表现苏维埃社会生活是在不断地前进着，一切都为了苏维埃人民气质的优秀方面向前发展，而且他们是用着在伟大的祖国战争时期所表现的力量在前进。号召我们的剧作家和导演们要积极参加对苏联人民的教育工作，答复他们的具有高级文化水平的问题，要把苏联的青年教育成活泼的，乐观的，忠于祖国和确信我们事业的胜利，不怕任何阻碍，善于克服一切困难的人。同时号召苏联的剧场，要表现这些品质并不是仅存在于个别的选择出来的人或英雄的身上，而是存在于几千万的苏维埃人民身上的。
    必须使所有善于创造戏剧作品的作家们，积极地创造地参加到编排那种品质适合于现代观众的剧场上演节目的具体工作上去。
    三、艺术工作委员会必须担负在每年在每一家剧场里至少要组织上演两三部以现代苏联为主题的思想和艺术方面属于上品的新剧，以为基本的实践任务。
    各剧场必须从根本形式上改善上演现代苏联剧本的品质，为这些剧本的演出，要选择优秀的导演和演员，使出演的艺术形式成为上品。
    四、建议艺术工作委员会要把思想空洞和缺乏艺术性的剧本从上演节目中剔除出去。要经常监视，勿使错误的，空洞的，没有思想和缺乏价值的作品侵入剧场。
    五、应当承认批评对于戏剧艺术发展的重要任务，“真理报”、“消息报”、“共产青年同盟真理报”、“劳动报”、“苏联艺术报”与“文学报”的编辑局应当在报纸上注意到刊载政治观点成熟的，有戏剧和文字修养的批评文章的工作。有系统地发表关于新剧本和演出的文章，和戏剧批评的脱离政治和思想空洞的倾向进行决战。
    各共和国报纸，边区报纸及州报纸的编辑局，必须有系统地登载关于当地剧场新剧演出的论文和批评。
    六、联共（布）中央指出，在把苏维埃的剧本向剧场里推进上的严重阻碍，就是有权利删改和通过剧本出版及在剧场演出问题的裁判官和个别人物太多了。各地的艺术管理局，各共和国艺术工作委员会的上演节目总会，艺术工作委员会戏剧总管理局，该委员会的艺术理事会、剧场领导者，编辑局和出版局的工作人员，都从事审查剧本工作，这就造成了有害的拖延和不负责任了，而且妨碍了迅速的把剧本向剧场的舞台上推进。
    向艺术工作委员会建议，要扫除一切妨害苏联剧作家的脚本发展，传播和在剧场上演的障碍，把从事审查剧本的裁判官应当减少到最低限度。把在委员会内应及时和迅速审查苏联剧作家所写的剧本这个责任由赫拉普琴科同志个人来负起。
    七、联共（布）中央确认，艺术工作委员会的艺术理事会在改善上演节目的品质，在提高其思想和艺术水准工作上，未能完成自己的任务，故步自封地领导工作，它的结果没能成为戏剧界广大社会的业绩，没能在报章上反映出来。
    艺术工作委员会必须认真地改善艺术理事会的工作。在艺术理事会的会议上，实行对新脚本和剧演出的批判的分析。艺术理事会的工作材料放在“苏联艺术报”上发表。
    八、准许艺术工作委员会会同苏联作家协会常委于一九四六——一九四七年，组织全苏联现代优秀苏维埃剧本的悬赏竞赛。
    九、考虑到各县邦及各自治共和国各剧场上演节目的非常狭小的限制，以及当地剧作家们的对于辽远的过去的题材的迷恋，艺术工作委员会必须采取方法将苏联剧作家的优秀剧本翻译成苏联各民族文字，同时并能排入各共和国的剧场上演节目。
    十、委任艺术工作委员会会同苏联作家协会理事会于今秋召开剧作家的和戏剧工作者会议，讨论上演节目及剧作家与剧场共同创作的工作问题。
