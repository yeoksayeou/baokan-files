　　Zhao Village Land Reform Victory Concludes: Poor Peasants All Elevated to Middle Peasants
    Winter School Celebrates Emancipation, Elects Thirty-Seven Heroes
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] The land reform movement in Zhao Village, District One, began vigorously last December and has now concluded victoriously after more than a month. All forty-four poor peasant households and eleven extremely poor households in the village have been elevated to middle peasant status, with an average of 4.5 mu of land per person. All one hundred twenty poor and middle peasant households have received the fruits of the struggle, and all feudal forces have been destroyed. During the movement, more than 300 people settled accounts with the feudal landlord Liu Juxian and twenty-four other households, producing during the day and holding meetings at night to discuss and distribute the fruits of the struggle, demonstrating extremely high fighting spirit. A total of 270 mu of land, 160 upper rooms, 60 cave dwellings, 22 head of livestock, and a large amount of grain and clothing were recovered. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, preferential treatment was given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. Demobilized soldier Wang Zhengshi received nine mu of land, three upper rooms, one cave dwelling, and one-third of a mule. He was so happy that he told everyone he met, "This is all given to us by Chairman Mao. I must work hard in production in the future to repay Chairman Mao." Currently, the masses in the village are universally engaged in transportation and other sideline production, and on New Year's Day, they celebrated their emancipation in the winter school and elected thirty-seven heroes of emancipation, including Xiang Chou'er and Li Laiyou. Everyone unanimously decided to engage in large-scale production this spring, hoping that the heroes of emancipation will become production heroes in the future, becoming dual heroes.

　　赵店查减胜利结束  贫农全部上升中农
    冬学里庆祝翻身选出英雄三十七人
    【本报黎城讯】一区赵店村查减运动，自去年十二月开始，蓬勃发展，历时月余，现已胜利结束。全村四十四户贫农及十一户赤贫，已都上升为中农，每人平均有地四亩半。一百二十户贫中农，均分得了斗争果实，封建势力全部被摧毁。在运动中，三百多群众向封建地主刘举贤等二十四户进行清算，白天生产，夜里开会讨论和分配果实，斗争情绪极高。共收回土地二百七十亩，楼房一百六十间，土窑六十孔，牲畜廿二头，及粮食衣物等甚多。分配果实时，并照顾了军烈属和荣退军人。荣退军人王征诗分到地九亩，楼房三间，土窑一孔，三分之一头骡子。他喜得见人就说：“这都是毛主席给我们的，今后我一定要好好生产来报答毛主席。”现全村群众正普遍搞运输及其他副业生产，并于元旦在冬学里庆祝翻身，选出向丑儿、李来友等三十七名翻身英雄。大家一致决定今春要搞大生产，希望翻身英雄将来都成为生产英雄，当双重英雄。
