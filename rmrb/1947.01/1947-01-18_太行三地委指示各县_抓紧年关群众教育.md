　　Taihang Third Prefectural Committee Instructs All Counties
    Seize the Opportunity of the New Year to Conduct Mass Education
    [This newspaper Taihang News] In order to carry out mass education work during the New Year, the Taihang Third Prefectural Committee issued instructions to all counties in the area, stating: "The New Year is approaching, and the liberated peasants in the entire region will definitely have a great celebration. We should seize this opportunity to carry out mass education work. This work is an important link in deepening the later stage of the movement, systematic ideological education, and promoting the movement. In terms of form, in addition to using mass entertainment to celebrate liberation and recall liberation, we must also use exhibitions to display the various methods and means by which landlords exploited peasants, the victorious fruits of the peasants' struggle, and the comparison of the peasants' lives in the past and present. Use vivid reality to give the masses a deep class education. In the border areas, we should combine the struggle against the enemy and launch a powerful political offensive against the enemy before and after the New Year. Use the opportunity of the masses to pay New Year's greetings to relatives and friends to hold symposiums and strengthen relations with the masses in the areas occupied by the Chiang army. Publicize why this year's New Year is not being celebrated well. Call on the masses to widely launch the anti-Chiang Kai-shek traitorous movement and strive to have a peaceful New Year next year."

　　太行三地委指示各县
    抓紧年关群众教育
    【本报太行讯】为开展年关群众教育工作，太行三地委向该区各县发出指示称：“年关在即，全区翻身农民届时必有一番大热闹。我们应抓紧时机，进行群众教育工作。这工作是深入运动后期，系统的思想教育和推动运动的重要环节。形式上除利用群众大娱乐，庆祝翻身，回忆翻身外，我们还必须用展览会方式，展览地主剥削农民的各种方法和手段，农民斗争的胜利果实，和农民今昔生活的对照。用活鲜鲜的现实，给群众以深刻的阶级教育。边沿地区则应结合对敌斗争，年关前后展开有力的对敌政治攻势。利用群众给亲友拜年机会，举行座谈会，密切与蒋军侵占区群众关系。宣传今年的年为啥过得不好。号召群众广泛展开反对蒋介石卖国运动，争取明年过太平年。
