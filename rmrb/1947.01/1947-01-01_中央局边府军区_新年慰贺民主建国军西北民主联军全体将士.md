    1946 has passed in victory, and 1947 has come with new tasks before us. In the past year of rapid transformation and complex circumstances, thanks to the hard work of Commander-in-Chief Gao and the efforts of all officers and soldiers, the Democratic National Construction Army has made rapid progress in all aspects, especially in the relationship between officers and soldiers and the relationship between the military and the people, and has achieved brilliant results. Not only are our border region party, government, military and people very happy and proud of this, but it also provides a clear enlightenment for all Kuomintang troops who are unwilling to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary civil war to find a bright path. On the occasion of this New Year's Day, we extend our congratulations and specially send each person 200 Jichaos as a New Year's gift to show our humble condolences. Please accept it with a smile!

You have finally overcome all difficulties and obstacles and reunited, grown stronger, and achieved great results in training and combat. Our border region party, government, military and people are very happy and feel that it is an honor to have such a people's army developing in the border region struggle.
