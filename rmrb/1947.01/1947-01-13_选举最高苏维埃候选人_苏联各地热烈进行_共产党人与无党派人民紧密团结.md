　　Election of Candidates to the Supreme Soviet
    Enthusiastic Progress Throughout the Soviet Union
  　Communists and Non-Party People Closely United
    [By Our Correspondent] (TASS dispatches of the 7th to 9th): The election of candidates to the Supreme Soviet of the Union and the Supreme Soviets of the autonomous republics is progressing enthusiastically throughout the Soviet Union. Factories and collective farms in Lankanderfel, the Northern Urals District, Moscow, Kalinin, Voskresensk, Lisichansk, Tambov, Kiev, Armenia, and other places have elected their best and most outstanding representatives. All electoral districts in the Russian Federation are vying to nominate Stalin as their candidate. As a result, Stalin agreed to be the candidate for the Stalin electoral district in Moscow, and Molotov also accepted the nomination of the Molotov electoral district.
    The *Pravda* editorial on the 8th, titled "The Stalin Bloc of Communists and Non-Party People," stated: "Thousands of candidates have been elected at election meetings; they are candidates of the united bloc of Communists and Non-Party people. The Bolshevik Party has closely united with Non-Party workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and is heading towards the upcoming election. The candidates jointly elected by Communists and Non-Party people vividly embody the indestructible spiritual and political unity of Soviet society." "Years of experience have convinced the Soviet people of the correctness of the Party's policies, and these policies are in line with the vital interests of the people. Under the leadership of the Party, the Soviet people have gained and defended their freedom, honor, and independence." "Under the leadership of the Party, the socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization have been completed. Under the leadership of the Party, the Soviet people won a victory of historic significance in the war in which the German aggressors were completely defeated. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people announced the grand new Stalin Five-Year Plan." Therefore, "the boundless trust in the Communist Party and its policies has formed a strong Stalin bloc of Communists and Non-Party people."
