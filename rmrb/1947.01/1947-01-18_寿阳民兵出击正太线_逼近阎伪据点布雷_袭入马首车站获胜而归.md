　　Shouyang Militia Attacks Zhengtai Railway Line
    Approaches Enemy Strongholds to Lay Mines
    Raids Mashou Station and Returns Victorious
    [This dispatch from Changzhi, 16th] "Advance into enemy strongholds and plant mines in the enemy's lair!" The Shouyang Militia Flying Bomb Squad is actively mobilized, terrifying the enemy puppet troops. On the 18th of last month, more than 150 enemy puppet troops in Mashou Station, with one steel cannon and four light and heavy machine guns, attempted to encircle and annihilate our militia rotation team. This was detected by our @Yu Village Militia, who laid a minefield on the enemy's inevitable path beforehand, killing and wounding three enemies. On the 19th, more than 40 enemy puppet troops from Shanghu Station attacked our Jinjiaping, and one was killed by a mine. The enemy returned the next day to retaliate, and again triggered a mine that we had laid in advance in the trenches, killing and wounding three more, and fled in a hurry. District cadre Wang Junsheng and others took advantage of the victory to penetrate deep into the enemy's Mashou stronghold, launch a blasting offensive, recapture horses and other items looted from the masses, and burn down the south gate of the stronghold.
