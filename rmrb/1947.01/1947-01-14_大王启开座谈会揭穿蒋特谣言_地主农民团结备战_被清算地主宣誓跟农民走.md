[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 12th] The Big Wangqi Village in the Seventh District of Yuanchao held a symposium for landlords who had been liquidated to expose the rumors of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and unanimously carry out war preparedness. During the war preparations, it was discovered that Chiang Kai-shek's special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, "The liquidated landlords will be killed soon." After hearing the rumor, Han Faxiang, a landlord in the village, fled to Küzhuang in the Eighth District on the night of December 20th to hide. After the village cadres explained, Han Faxiang returned and said to the village cadres, "Don't mention it, I was fooled by the special agents. I will never go against the masses again, or I am not my father's son." In order to prevent the liquidated landlords from being afraid, the village held a symposium for all the landlords in the village that morning. Han Huaichen, the director of the small district peasant representative conference, explained that the government would absolutely guarantee the land rights of the land reserved for the landlords, and no one could infringe on them, and would also help the landlords develop industry and commerce. Everyone should participate in production and become rich through self-cultivation. Then the landlord Wang Baoting said, "I used to hear the bad guys say that there was no guarantee, but now I am relieved, and I know that the Communist Party also takes good care of us." Finally, everyone swore an oath, some landlords said, "If I don't follow the masses, may I be a male thief and a female prostitute!" Some said, "If I help the Chiang Kai-shek army do bad things, I am willing to be punished by law." The meeting ended in a harmonious and tense atmosphere. Now the people of all strata in the village are united and actively carrying out war preparedness.
