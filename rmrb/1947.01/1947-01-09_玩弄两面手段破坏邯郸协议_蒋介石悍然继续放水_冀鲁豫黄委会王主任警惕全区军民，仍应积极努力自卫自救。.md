Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Regarding the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course, at the Handan talks on the 3rd, UNRRA advisor Todd indicated that the blocking of the breach would cease on the 4th, and he would immediately proceed to Zhengzhou and Shanghai to carry out the cessation of blocking and to urge the allocation of relocation funds. However, on the 4th, a Central News Agency dispatch stated: "The Yellow River, diverted into the old course, has passed Liuyuan Port north of Bian and reached the new roadbed in Kaifeng." On the 5th, the Central News Agency continued to report, "The diversion entrance was breached by the high water level upstream on the 20th of last month, and by the 5th, it had passed the new road in Bian." This behavior clearly demonstrates that the Kuomintang authorities are engaging in double-dealing tactics, violating the verbal agreement of the Handan talks, and releasing water to return the river to its old course, in order to achieve their conspiracy to kill the people.

This newspaper's special dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek's brazenly blocking the breach and releasing water has aroused boundless anger among the military and civilians of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. This reporter visited Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. Director Wang vehemently condemned Chiang Kai-shek for violating previous agreements on Yellow River management, blocking the breach and releasing water, attempting to submerge the lives and property of the vast residents in the middle and lower reaches of the old Yellow River course. He also told the reporter: "Our representatives Zhao Mingfu, Wang Xiaoyi, and Cheng Run have gone to Nanjing to lodge a serious protest with the Chiang side, demanding that the Chiang side immediately stop blocking the breach and releasing water. At the same time, our General Rao Shushi and Deputy Chairman Rong Wusheng of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, General Teng Daiyuan, and UNRRA representatives held a meeting in Handan on the Yellow River issue, and have initially agreed to postpone the blocking of the breach and release of water for five months, immediately allocate the due dike restoration and relocation funds, and block the water flowing into the old course of the Yellow River." Director Wang continued: "The people in the Liberated Areas must not think that the Yellow River problem has been completely resolved, and that the great disaster threatening the lives and property of seven million people along the river has passed. We must know that this is only a negotiation, and we sincerely hope that they will put it into practice. Now, the surging Yellow River is still flowing towards our area. We must remember the experiences and lessons of the past year. The Chinese people have recognized that all solemn clauses and agreements can be torn up by Chiang Kai-shek at any time and treated as waste paper. Therefore, although the Handan talks have progressed very well, before they are put into practice, the military and civilians of our entire region must remain vigilant at all times and step up self-defense and self-salvation! At the same time, we also hope that UNRRA will adhere to a fair position in implementing the results of this negotiation, in order to win the trust of the Chinese people."

Regarding whether the dike construction in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River can be completed within five months, and whether the residents of the riverbed can be relocated as scheduled, Director Wang replied to the reporter: "If the Chiang side can allocate the 4.29 million yuan of dike restoration and relocation funds on time, and no longer arbitrarily sabotage our projects and harm our dike repair workers as in the past, the people of the Liberated Areas have the strength and confidence to complete the dike restoration project within five months. In the second week after the Nanjing agreement last year - May 26th - more than 400,000 workers were mobilized to start the dike restoration project. However, the Chiang side has been in arrears with wages and materials worth 490,000 yuan to this day. At the same time, the Heze-Kaocheng and Heze-Shangqiu highways, which were rushed to transport river management materials, have been continuously sabotaged by Chiang's puppet troops since June 1st, and were completely blockaded in early August, and all material supplies were completely cut off. Not only that, but in various counties along the river, such as Changyuan, Kaocheng, Qihe, Changqing, and Hexi, the Chiang puppet troops stationed there, combined with special agent armed forces, harassed us in every way during our dike repair, and brutally killed and captured our river workers. From the 3rd until the Chiang army launched a large-scale offensive against Hebei-Shandong-Henan, according to incomplete statistics, there were no less than dozens of times. After the Chiang army occupied Heze, Dongming and other places, they spared no effort to sabotage our river works, digging trenches and building fortifications on the dikes on both sides. The dike from the old city of Juancheng to the Batou dam in Puyang has become dilapidated. They also used aircraft to strafe our dike repair workers and riverside agencies. The Chiang side has repeatedly robbed our river management materials, totaling various losses worth 340.415 million yuan in legal tender. Based on these materials, we can know the reasons why the dike restoration project could not be carried out in the past." Finally, Director Wang said: The key to the current problem lies in the Chiang side's sincere implementation of the agreement, ensuring that the river management project is not affected by military affairs, otherwise everything will be empty talk. We still make an urgent appeal to the whole of China and the whole world, demanding that all righteous people rise up to stop Chiang Kai-shek's crime of closing the breach and releasing water in order to save the lives and property of seven million people along the river.

    玩弄两面手段破坏邯郸协议
    蒋介石悍然继续放水
    冀鲁豫黄委会王主任警惕全区军民，仍应积极努力自卫自救。
    【新华社延安七日电】黄河归故问题，三日邯郸会谈，联总顾问塔德表示四日即停止堵口，并即分赴郑州、上海进行停堵及督促拨发迁移费诸工作，但四日中央社讯：“引入旧道之黄河，已过汴北柳园口，到达开封新路基”。五日中央社续报“引河口门于上月二十日因上游水位高涨，被水流冲开，五日已过汴新路”。此种行为，显系国民党当局玩弄两面手段，破坏邯郸会谈的口头协议，而放水归故，达其杀害人民阴谋。
    【本报特讯】蒋介石悍然堵口放水，激起冀鲁豫军民无限愤怒。记者走访冀鲁豫黄河水利委员会主任王化云氏，王主任痛责蒋介石破坏历次治黄协议，堵口放水，企图淹没黄河故道中下游广大居民的生命财产。并告记者说：“我方代表赵明甫、王笑一、成润等已赴南京向蒋方提出严重抗议，要求蒋方立即停止堵口放水，同时我方饶漱石将军与晋冀鲁豫边区政府戎伍胜副主席、滕代远将军与联总代表在邯郸举行黄河问题会议，并已初步商定堵口放水延迟五个月，立即拨付应给的复堤迁移费，并堵住流入黄河故道之水。”王氏继谓：“解放区人民千万不要以为黄河问题已经完满解决，威胁着沿河七百万人民生命财产的大灾难已成过去，须知这只是一个谈判，我们是诚恳希望他们能见诸实行，现在滚滚黄水还正流向我区。我们必须记取一年来的经验教训，中国人民已认清了一切庄严的条文协定，蒋介石都可以随时当做废纸而信手撕毁。因此此次邯郸谈判虽然进行得很好，但在未见诸实行以前，我全区军民仍要时时刻刻提高警惕，加紧自卫自救！同时也希望联总在执行这一谈判结果时坚持公正立场，以取信于中国人民。”
    对于黄河中下游的堤工五个月内是否能够完成？河床居民是否能如期迁移完毕？王主任回答记者说：“假使蒋方能按时将四二九万万元的复堤迁移费如数拨来，不再像过去一样肆意破坏我方工程，残害我方修堤员工，解放区人民是有力量有信心于五个月内完成复堤工程的。去年南京协议后的第二星期——五月廿六日就动员了四十多万工人，开始复堤工程。可是蒋方却拖欠工款工料四十九万万元至今不发。同时为运输治河物资而赶修的荷（泽）考（城），和荷（泽）商（邱）两公路，自六月一日起便遭到蒋伪军的连续破坏，八月初更被完全封锁，一切物资供应遂完全断绝。不仅如此，沿河各县，如驻长垣、考城、齐河、长清、河西各地的蒋伪军，结合特务武装，在我方修堤期间，四出骚扰，惨杀捕捉我方沿河员工，从三日开始直到蒋军大举进攻冀鲁豫时，据不完全统计已不下数十次。至蒋军侵占荷泽、东明等地后，对我河工破坏更不遗余力，在两岸大堤上挖战壕修工事，由鄄城旧城集到濮阳坝头间的大堤已残破不堪。并以飞机扫射我方修堤工人及沿河机关。蒋方一再强劫我方治河物资，综计各种损失，共值法币三十四万万零四百十五万元。根据这些材料，可以知道过去复堤工程所以无法进行的原因何在。”最后王主任表示：目前问题的关键在于蒋方诚意的执行协议，保证治河工程不受军事影响，否则一切将成空谈。我们仍向全中国全世界作紧急呼吁，要求一切正义人士，为着挽救沿河七百万人民的生命财产，起而制止蒋介石合龙放水的罪行。
