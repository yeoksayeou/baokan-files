Southern Hebei and Southern Ningxia Masses' Emancipation Poetry
    Four Household 榜 (List/Ranking)
    Compiled by Dazhoujia Village

    Member households are not all the same,
    The Four Household 榜 explains in detail.
    Whoever can become a model household,
    Everyone will praise and commend.

    Model Household

    Model households are extraordinary,
        Men join the Farmers' Association,
        Women participate in the Women's Association.
        Boys and girls join the Sisters' and Children's Corps,
        Both labor and production are undertaken.
        Arrive early for meetings,
        Speak out first,
        The whole family is united,
        Forever following Chairman Mao.

    Backward Household

    Backward households,
        Are cunning,
        Want to eat meat,
        But dislike the smell,
        Just to get a name and a share of the dividends.
        Dislike work delays,
        Fear old Chiang,
        Want to wash away the member's name.
        We advise them to change.

    Criticized Household

    Criticized households,
        Have bad intentions.
        Scatter the fields and hide wealth,
        Hate the poor when they see them.
        See anyone doing well,
        Pour some bewitching soup.
        Criticized households,
        You listen:
        Wanting to exploit people again is not allowed,
        From now on, reform and learn to work,
        I guarantee you can live in peace.

    Isolated Household

    Speaking of isolated households,
        Talking about isolated households,
        Isolated households suffer loneliness.
        When others have a meeting,
        They are resentful.
        Spreading rumors,
        Talking nonsense.
        Calling to isolated households,
        Listen carefully:
        If you don't reform,
        Hang up a sign,
        An isolated household sign,
        Hanging on the door,
        Like smearing mud on your face.
        As soon as you go out,
        A foul stench.
        Adults and children don't look at you.

　　冀南宁南群众翻身诗歌
    四户榜
    大周家庄编
    会员家户不一样，
    四户榜上说端详。
    谁要够上模范户，
    人人赞成都夸奖。
    模范户
    模范家户不一般，
    男人入农会，
    女人妇会参。
    男女孩加入姐妹儿童团，
    劳动又生产。
    开会早到，
    发言当先，
    全家心齐，
    永远跟着毛主席。
    落后户
    落后户，
    心眼精，
    想吃肉，
    又嫌腥，
    顶个名子分点红。
    嫌误工，
    怕老蒋，
    会员名义想洗光。
    咱们劝他改一改。
    被斗户
    被斗户，
    心不良。
    疏散田地把财藏，
    看见穷人恨的慌。
    看见谁顺劲，
    泼点迷糊汤。
    被斗户，
    你是听：
    想再吃人那不中，
    从今改过学劳动，
    管保你能过安宁。
    说零户
    说零户，
    道零户，
    零户受单孤。
    人家一开会，
    他的气不服。
    造谣言，
    瞎叽咕。
    叫零户，
    听明白：
    不改过，
    挂上牌，
    零户牌，
    门上挂，
    好比脸上抹巴巴。
    一出门，
    一股臭。
    大人小孩没人瞅。
