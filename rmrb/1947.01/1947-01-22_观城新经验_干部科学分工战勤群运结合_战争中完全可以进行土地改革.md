　　New Experience in Guancheng
    Scientific Division of Labor for Cadres, Combination of Wartime Service and Mass Mobilization
    Land Reform Can Absolutely Be Carried Out During War
    [This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 19th] The land-to-the-tiller movement in the First District of Guancheng has created new experiences. In a recent training class for village cadres and poor peasants, a simple survey of 66 households in seven villages was conducted. Among them were three extremely poor households with only 0.5 mu of land per person, and 25 poor peasant households with only about 1 mu of land per person. Many landlords were still evading burdens and struggle. In most villages, there were fake mortgages and superficially "voluntary" actions, secretly paying rent. The landlords' red contracts and documents were not brought out, and the peasants felt uneasy. Some people were even exploited by usury. How can this incomplete land reform phenomenon be overcome? The result of everyone's research was: First, cadres must be enlightened to recognize the harm of the "good enough" mentality. It must be clear that today's standard is to eliminate feudal exploitation, fill in the gaps among households, determine land rights, and thoroughly liberate the masses. Second, the existing phenomena of landlords' fake mortgages and sales, and failure to produce documents, should be measured against the standard of thorough liberation and thoroughly resolved. Third, cadres should also trace the roots of poverty and discuss who relies on whom for food. After a day of debate, most cadres in the First District clarified feudal exploitation, figured out who owned the land, and resolved to lead the masses to thoroughly carry out land reform. After the village cadres' thinking was cleared and their awareness was raised, they returned to their villages and discovered more problems and were able to see the demands of the masses. Secondly, after ideological clarity, the contradiction between liberation and wartime service tasks should be resolved. Cadres should be divided into different working groups; otherwise, urgent wartime service tasks will still cause hesitation in leadership. This time, the First District sent out 130 stretchers while simultaneously holding a training class for 240 village cadres and poor peasants. Most of them arrived on time. This proves that as long as the leadership goes deep into the work and there is a scientific division of labor, land reform can absolutely be carried out. Because the idea of ​​"no hope" was cleared up, cadres throughout the district had new creations and experiences: First, cultivate and use a large number of activists. This time, a training class of more than 240 people was held. The experience of the training class was that there should be more people in each village (some villages sent 17 people), the time should be shorter, fewer issues should be discussed, and more poor peasants should come. Second, the District Peasants' Association issued a call for land reform based on the demands of the masses, so that the masses could understand the attitude of the higher authorities toward the land issue and give the masses a direction. When the poor peasants in Machang held a meeting, the district cadre announced the call. They happily said: "It really fits our thoughts. Let's do it, and the higher-ups will support us." Various methods were used to organize primary school teachers and district cadres to conduct public propaganda to create momentum for the movement. Third, due to the busy wartime service and the exhaustion of the masses, there are more difficulties in developing the movement; the main cadres of the county and district must personally take action and go deep into creating experience. This time, the main cadres of the county and district went down to the villages, which strengthened the confidence of the district cadres and made great achievements in the work.

　　观城新经验
    干部科学分工战勤群运结合
    战争中完全可以进行土地改革
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】观城一区土地还家运动，创造了新的经验。在最近开办的村干、贫农训练班上，作了七个村六十六户的简单调查，其中赤贫三户，每人仅有五分地，贫农二十五户，每口只有一亩地上下，而不少地主却仍逃避负担与斗争，大部村庄都有假当及表面“自动”，暗里交租，地主的红契文书没拿出来，农民内心不安，甚至群众还有受高利贷剥削者，怎样克服这种土地改革不彻底的现象？大家研究的结果：第一、要启发干部认识“差不多”思想的危害，必须明确今天的标准是消灭封建剥削，按户填平补齐，确定地权，使群众彻底翻身。第二、现存的地主假当假卖，不拿文书等现象，应从彻底翻身的标准上来衡量，加以彻底解决。第三、干部也应该追穷根，讨论谁靠谁吃饭。一区干部经过一天的争论，大部明确了封建剥削，弄清了地是谁的，都决心领导群众彻底进行土地改革。村干部思想打通，觉悟提高后，回村几天，就发现了更多的问题，也能看见群众要求了。其次，思想打通后，就应当解决翻身与战勤任务的矛盾。干部要分工，不然紧急的战勤任务，还会使领导上犹豫。这次一区出一百卅付担架，同时召开了村干贫农二百四十人的训练班，大部按时到齐。证明了只要领导上深入工作和科学分工，土地改革是完全可以进行的。由于弄通了“没搞头”的想法，全区干部就有新的创造与经验：第一、培养与运用大批积极分子。这次召开了二百四十余人的训练班，训练班的经验，每村人要多些（有的村来十七个的），时间要短，讲的问题要少，成份上贫农要多来。第二、区农民联合会根据群众要求，颁发土地改革的号召书，使群众了解上级对土地问题的态度，使群众有方向。马场贫农开会时，区干宣布号召书后，他们高兴的说：“真对咱的心事，干吧，上级给咱作主”。用各种方式组织小学教员、区干公开宣传，造成运动。第三、由于战勤繁忙，群众疲惫，运动开展起来，困难是比较多的；县区主要干部，一定要亲自下手，深入创造经验。这次县区主要干部都下到村，这样坚定了区干信心，使工作有了很大的成绩。
