　　Writing About the Overturn
    Editor

    Comrade Bo Yibo told us in his New Year's message: "In the past year, our entire Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region has basically completed land reform. 6.5 million poor and hired peasants have been allocated 18 million mu of land, and 20 million peasants have been liberated from feudal exploitation..." What a momentous event this is! This event contains so many rich, vivid, moving, and inspiring facts that require many pens to vividly portray them! However, looking through our submission registration book, there are not many such manuscripts, and good ones are especially scarce. Other publications don't seem to have many either. Comparing the two, one cannot help but say: much has been done, but little has been written. The literature of the "overturn" lags behind the "overturn" movement.

    Therefore, we feel that more people should write about the "overturn." So, who should write?

    First of all, we must invite those engaged in the "overturn" movement to write. Only practical workers have authentic material, and writing will be "uncomplicated." But they may say: we are busy, we don't have time to write, and we don't know how to write. True, everyone is really busy, but after doing the work, shouldn't you write a work experience report? Work experience reports are certainly important, but a good typical description of a "turned-over" peasant sometimes has more educational significance and a greater driving force than a general work experience. This point must be understood ideologically. Attach importance to this work: write more if you can, learn to write if you can't write well, and if you really can't write, you should encourage those who can write a little to write, or even discuss and write collectively with some cadres. Don't regard literature as something profound that only writes about fantasies, but firmly believe that the heroic cause of the "overturn" is more worthy of being engraved on a monument than anything else. Boldly grasp the people and events that move you, and do your best to write them down. You don't have to worry about whether it looks like a novel or a poem, just ask whether it has written the true feelings. As far as we editors are concerned, we would rather discard empty theories that are written smoothly but without substance, and spend time revising manuscripts that are written with clumsy words but contain vivid facts. Naturally, we hope that workers can learn from Li Ji, the author of "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," who worked in the county and district while paying attention to improving their literary cultivation. In that way, the creation of "overturn" literature will be even more promising.

    On the other hand, we must invite writers and intellectuals to participate in the "overturn" work. There is no need to say more about the principle, but there is an example to be cited, that is, Comrade Zhao Shuli. His works have won national honor because he truly wrote about the actual situation of the peasants and rural struggles in the liberated areas. He still lives in the countryside, recuperating while learning from the peasants. Now most of our writers live in the countryside, and it cannot be said that they are not close to the peasants. But we must take a step closer in terms of life and emotions, and it is best to participate in some work in the nearby base villages, collect the songs and dramas of the peasants' "overturn" and write them down, and help the cadres to write, and also write themselves. Be humble but not too reserved, and don't regard writing entirely as a personal success or failure, but as an aspect of the battle to promote the "overturn" movement, and do your best in writing.

    Countless Li Jis and countless Zhao Shulis will advance separately and then join hands, and the "overturn" literature in our border areas may make rapid progress and overcome the backward phenomenon. Is this the case? What we say in the editorial office may not be correct, let everyone discuss it. But discussion is discussion, and more importantly, start writing. The supplement is open, welcome to write about the "overturn"!

　　写翻身
    编者
    薄一波同志在新年献词中告诉我们：“一年以来，我全晋冀鲁豫区已基本上完成了土地改革，六百五十万贫雇农民已分到一千八百万亩土地，两千万农民已从封建压榨下解放出来了，………”这是一件何等惊天动地的大事！这件大事中包含多少丰富生动可歌可泣的事实，须要多少支笔把它活龙活现的刻画出来！可是，翻翻我们来稿登记簿，这类稿件却并不多，好的尤其少，别的书刊上也不见得怎么多。两相比较起来，就不能不说：作得多，写得少，翻身的文艺显得落后于翻身的运动了。
    因此我们觉得应当有更多的人来写翻身。那么，什么人来写呢？
    首先要请从事翻身运动的工作者来写。只有踏实的工作者，才有真实的货色，写起来才“不隔”。可是他们会说：我们事忙，没工夫写，也不会写。不错，大家真忙，可是做了工作，你是不是要写篇工作经验呢？工作经验报告固然重要，但是一篇好的翻身农民的典型描写，有时会比一篇概括的工作经验，教育的意义更多，推动的作用更大，这一点一定要在思想上搞通。重视这件工作吧：自己能写加紧写，自己写不好学着写，真正不能写的也要推动稍微能写的来写，更可以找些干部一齐商量着集体来写。不要把文艺看作专写空想的高深莫测的东西，应当坚信翻身的英雄事业比什么都更值得刻上纪念碑。大胆的抓住使自己感动的人和事迹，尽力之所及把它写出来，先可不必管它像不像什么小说、诗歌等的样子，只问是否写出了真情实感。就我们编辑者来说，我们宁可丢弃写得光堂堂的而言之无物的空论，而愿花费时间给写得字句错乱，然而却有生动事实的稿子进行修改。自然，我们更盼望工作者都能学习“王贵与李香香”的作者李寄，一面在县区工作，一面注意提高自己的文艺修养，那样翻身文艺的创造，就更有希望。
    另一方面要请作家和知识分子们参加翻身工作。道理无须多说，范例倒有一个可举，那就是赵树理同志。他的作品已获得全国的荣誉。因为他真正写出了解放区的农民和农村斗争的实际。他现在还住在乡间，一面养病，一面向农民学习。现在我们作家大多住在乡间，离农民不能说是不近。但还要在生活感情上更密接一步，最好是在附近的基点村中参加一部分工作，一面搜集农民的翻身歌谣、戏剧，把他写下来，一面帮助干部写作，自己也写作。要虚心但也莫太矜持，把写作不全看做个人的成败，而作为推进翻身运动的战斗的一个方面，从写作中尽自己的力量。
    无数的李寄和无数的赵树理分头并进而又携起手来，我们边区的翻身文艺也许就会突飞猛进起来，克服掉落后的现象了。是不是这样呢？我们坐在编辑室里说得未必对，大家来讨论一番吧。但，讨论是讨论，更重要的还是动笔写。副刊开着门，欢迎写翻身！
