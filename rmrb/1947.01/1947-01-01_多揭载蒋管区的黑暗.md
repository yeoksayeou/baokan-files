　　Expose More of the Darkness in the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
    Supplement
    Comrade Xiao Jian, Editor:
    The following is my reply to "What do you need?" I feel that our Liberated Area newspapers do not reprint and introduce enough of the opinions and communications from relatively fair newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. I hope this can be remedied. Because, "You don't fear not recognizing the goods, you only fear not comparing goods," if there are more vivid exposures of the darkness in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, the brighter side of the Liberated Areas will become even more lovable in the eyes of the people living in its embrace.
    Based on Comrade Qiao Mu's powerful advocacy of "shorter, even shorter," and "Chairman Mao Sends His Son to Labor University," with the writing of a nine-year-old child capable of giving people a profound impact, I believe it should be one of the directions of the supplement's efforts.
    Book reviews are also important. For example, the book "Corrosion" by Mao Dun, published in other areas, is constantly being passed around and read here. The newspaper should not only introduce it but also use this mouthpiece of the masses to urge the publishing industry in the Liberated Areas to move towards "reprinting valuable books from other areas."

　　多揭载蒋管区的黑暗
    副刊
    肖健编辑同志：
    下面是我对“你需要什么”的答复，我觉得我们解放区报纸，对蒋管区比较公正的报章上的言论及通讯等的转载和介绍是不够的，希望能补救这一点。因为，“不怕不识货，只怕货比货”，如果对蒋管区的黑暗有更多生动的揭载，就使得解放区的光明面在生活于他的怀抱中的人们心目中越发可爱。
    根据乔木同志“短些，再短些”这一有力的提倡，“毛主席送子上劳动大学”，以一个九岁儿童的写作，能给予人们以深刻的影响，我以为应是副刊的努力方向之一。
    书报介绍也是要紧的，比如外区出版的茅盾作“腐蚀”一书，在我们这里不停的传看中。报上不但应介绍，并应经过这大众的喉舌，去督促解放区的出版事业向“翻印外区有价值书籍”这方面走。
