　　The Hearts of the People
    Random Notes on the Emancipation in Linzhang
    During my work participating in the emancipation team to mobilize the masses in Linzhang, I personally witnessed the hearts of the people:
  Shooting a Paper Effigy
    It was drizzling. Villagers from more than ten villages in Zhangliji and Beidongfang were holding a joint struggle meeting to denounce the crimes of the traitor Zhang Zhaolan. This traitor had served as a puppet district chief and had committed all kinds of atrocities, including rape, robbery, and murder, relying on the enemy's power for several years. More than eighty villagers from Nandongfang alone were brutally murdered. When people were pouring out their grievances, men, women, old and young, swarmed onto the rostrum, their complaints becoming a unified voice, their cries merging into a heap, demanding that the traitor Zhang Zhaolan be shot. But he had already escaped—becoming a lackey of Chiang Kai-shek in the Chiang-occupied area of southern Zhang River. What could be done? Everyone made a paper effigy, wrote the name of the traitor Zhang Zhaolan on it, paraded it through the streets, and then the militiamen collectively shot it, which was considered a bit of relief for the hatred in the people's hearts.
  Kowtowing to Chairman Mao Every Day
    In the Third District, everyone knows about old Zhang Xin. He had begged for a living his whole life, but now he is emancipated, has a house, has land, and lives a good life. He often says to people: Chairman Mao saved him, and he must repay the favor. But he can't go to Yan'an, so he bought a picture of Chairman Mao and hung it in his house. He always has to kowtow to it every day, or he can't eat his meals.
  The Emancipation Team Carries a "Magic Weapon"
    Guzi, Yanshi, and more than ten other villages are close to Ci County. In the past, it was a no-man's land, with no grain tax or levies. When the Japanese devils occupied Linzhang, they used tanks and cannons to attack, but they couldn't get in. The bandit Guo Qing also came to attack several times, but he was bloodied and defeated. This time, all the other villages in the county have been emancipated, leaving only these few villages untouched. The comrades of the emancipation team said they would go to open up the mass movement there. The masses in the surrounding villages said, "The people there are savage and difficult to deal with, so it's better not to go!" But the emancipation team still led the people there. They didn't fight, they didn't attack, they just went in. Because the comrades of the emancipation team could serve the vast number of oppressed and exploited people and endure hardships, the people there supported them wherever they went. It only took more than ten days to mobilize the masses in those ten villages. The people said, "The emancipation team is led by Chairman Mao and carries a 'magic weapon'."

### 老百姓的心  临漳翻身杂记

　　老百姓的心
    临漳翻身杂记
    在我参加翻身队去临漳发动群众的工作中，使我亲眼看到了老百姓的心：
  枪毙纸人
    天下着细雨，章里集，北东坊十几村的老百姓，在开联合斗争大会，控诉汉奸张兆兰的罪行。张逆曾当过伪区长，几年来仗着敌人势力，奸淫、抢杀无所不为。光南东坊的老百姓，就被残杀八十多人。当人们诉苦的时候，男女老少蜂拥在主席台上，诉成一片，哭成一堆，要求枪毙汉奸张兆兰。可是他早逃跑了——在漳河南蒋占区当老蒋的走狗，怎么办呢？大家就糊了个纸人，写上汉奸张兆兰的名字，把它拿到街上游行后，民兵们集体枪毙它，这样才算解了点人民心头之恨。
  每天给毛主席磕头
    三区的人一提起老张欣，没一个不知道，他讨了一辈子饭，现在翻身了，有了房，有了地，生活过的很好。他常对人说：这是毛主席救了他，一定要报报恩。可是又不能到延安去，于是就买了个毛主席像挂在家里，每天总要给磕个头，要不然他就吃不下饭。
  翻身队带有“法宝”
    谷子、盐食等十余村，紧靠磁县，过去是两不管地方，不纳粮，不缴款，日寇占临漳时，曾用坦克攻、大炮轰，也没打进去。土匪郭清也来打过几回，结果都碰得头破血流而去。这次该县其它各个村都翻身了，就剩下这几个村还没动，翻身队的同志们都说要去打开群运的局面。周围村的群众都说：“那地方人野蛮，不好惹，还是不要去吧！”可是翻身队还是领着人去了，也没打，也没攻，就进去了。因为翻身队的同志们能为广大受压迫受剥削的人民服务，吃苦耐劳；因而他们走到那里，那里的人民就拥护他们。只花了十几天的工夫，就把那十几个村的群众都发动起来了。老百姓说：“翻身队是毛主席领导下的，带的有‘法宝’。”
