A memorial service and public burial will be held on the 29th of this month.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 26th: Comrade Zhu Baoting's brief biography is as follows: A native of Ningbo, Zhejiang, he was a seaman by profession and one of the oldest leaders of the Chinese workers' movement. He led the Shanghai workers' struggle during the May Fourth period. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1922 and directly participated in leading the Hong Kong Seamen's Strike and the May Thirtieth Movement. He attended the Chinese Labor Congress and the Pacific Trade Union Conference four times and was successively elected as a member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a member of the Pacific Trade Union International Committee, and a member of the Seamen's Trade Union International Committee. During this period, he was arrested and imprisoned twice. After the Great Revolution, he went underground and tenaciously led the seamen's struggles in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Tianjin. Later, due to the Kuomintang's widespread pursuit, he was forced to go to the Soviet Union to participate in the Red Trade Union International movement. In 1933, he was sent to Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi to participate in the Soviet movement. In 1935, he returned to Shanghai to participate in the work of the Chinese Armed Self-Defense Association and was arrested by the Kuomintang, putting up an extremely heroic struggle in prison. After being released from prison after the War of Resistance against Japan began, he led the Wuhan workers to participate in the war effort. Later, due to old age and physical weakness, he was transferred to Yan'an by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for rest and served as a member of the Workers' Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party until his death on January 24, 1947, at the age of 67.
