    Italy is located in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the Italian Peninsula, Sicily, Sardinia, and several small islands in the Mediterranean. It has a population of approximately 42.2 million and an area of approximately 310,000 square kilometers. The northern part is an industrial area, while the southern part is mainly agricultural.

    In October 1922, the Fascist dictator Mussolini, with the support of the "Fiat Consortium" financial oligarchs, ruled all of Italy, carrying out frantic aggression abroad and implementing a reign of terror at home. During World War II, it formed the "Axis Alliance" with Nazi Germany, ravaging the people of Europe and Africa, and attacking the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the Italian Communist Party led the Italian people in widely organizing guerrilla forces and launching an anti-fascist movement. In October 1941, the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party jointly organized the National Liberation Committee and absorbed various democratic parties to participate. At the end of 1942, the two parties and the Christian Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Action Party formed the National Front, and the Italian people's anti-fascist sentiment became increasingly high. Finally, on July 25, 1943, the people drove the traitor and dictator Mussolini off the stage.

    After the collapse of the Mussolini regime, Badoglio organized a government, which still implemented fascist policies and suppressed the anti-fascist mass movement. He was subsequently forced to step down by the people, and Bonomi reorganized the cabinet. The five major parties united under the National Liberation Committee also participated in the cabinet and fought alongside the Allied countries. The North Italian guerrillas liberated Milan and Genoa and occupied areas on the Italian-Swiss border. The North Italian National Liberation Committee accepted the North Italian regime.

    After the collapse of Germany, the Bonomi cabinet resigned. All five major parties agreed to have Action Party leader Parri organize a new government. Due to the unity of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the left-wing parties dominated the Parri coalition government.

    In June of last year, the results of the parliamentary elections showed that although the Christian Democratic Party occupied the most seats, the combined strength of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party still exceeded the Christian Democratic Party's power. The result of the plebiscite on June 4th rejected the monarchy. Emperor Umberto, who had been in power for only sixteen days, had to flee abroad. Since then, Italy has truly embarked on the road to democracy.

    The Italian Communist Party is currently the most prestigious political party in Italy. The number of party members has increased from 1,762,000 to 2,135,000, accounting for 5% of the country's population. In the new government, it is mainly responsible for the three ministries of justice, agriculture, and finance. In previous democratic movements, the Italian Communist Party has played a leading role. In the upcoming Italian parliamentary elections this spring, the Italian Communist Party has formed an electoral alliance with the Socialist Party and put forward a common program to fight for the eradication of fascist remnants and the consolidation of a democratic Italy.

    意大利位于地中海中央，合意大利半岛，西西里岛，撒了岛及地中海若干小岛而成，人口约四千二百二十万，面积约三十一万方公里。其北部为工业区，南部则以务农为主。
    法西斯魔王墨索里尼于一九二二年十月，在“飞亚特财团”金融寡头们的支持下，统治全意大利，对外疯狂侵略，对国内实行恐怖的专政。第二次世界大战，与纳粹德国结为“轴心同盟”，蹂躏欧非两洲人民，进攻苏联。另一方面，意大利共产党领导意国人民广泛的组织游击队，掀起反法西斯运动。一九四一年十月，意共与社会两党联合组织民族解放委员会，并吸收各民主党派参加。四二年年底，两党又与基督教民主党、自由党、行动党组成民族阵线，意大利人民反法西斯情绪愈益高涨。终于在一九四三年七月二十五日，把民贼独夫墨索里尼撵下台去。
    墨索里尼政权崩溃后，由巴多格里奥组织政府，他仍然施行着法西斯政策，压迫反法西斯的群众运动，旋由人民逼迫下台，波诺密重新组阁，民族解放委员会团结下的五大政党也参加组阁，并和盟国并肩作战。意北游击队解放了米兰和热那亚，占领意瑞边境的地方，意北民族解放委员会接受了意北政权。
    德国崩溃后，波诺密内阁辞职，五大政党都赞成行动党领袖巴里组织新政府，由于共产党与社会党团结的结果，在巴里联合政府中，左翼政党占了优势。
    去年六月，议会选举的结果，基督教民主党虽占席位最多，然社会党与共产党的力量加起来仍超过基督教民主党的势力。六月四日公民投票复决的结果，君主政体被人民否决了。在位仅十六日的安伯托皇帝不得不出走外国。从此意大利真正走向民主的道路。
    意大利共产党是目前意国的最有威信的政党，党员已由一百七十六万二千人增至二百十三万五千人，为全国人口的百分之五，在新政府中多负责司法、农业、财政三部。在历次民主运动中，意共都起着领导作用。即将到来的今春意国会选举，意共已与社会党结成选举联盟，并提出共同纲领，为肃清法西斯残余，巩固民主意大利而奋斗。
