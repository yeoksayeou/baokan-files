　　Able in both Civil and Military Affairs, Resourceful and Courageous
    The CCP Taihang Third Prefectural Committee Calls on Border Counties to
  　Vigorously Launch the Guo Xing Movement
    [This newspaper, Changzhi dispatch] The CCP Taihang Third Prefectural Committee issued a call on New Year's Day to border counties to vigorously launch the Guo Xing Movement. Comrade Tao Lujia, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, also wrote a special article on this, pointing out that Comrade Guo Xing was an outstanding figure in the struggle against the enemy in Hui County, able in both civil and military affairs, resourceful and courageous. Over the past year, no matter how harsh the environment, he has always led district cadres and a dozen or so capable militia work teams to persist in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. His struggle policy is: the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance. He turned many guerrilla areas forcibly occupied by Chiang and the puppets into liberated areas, and also extensively established mass work in the Chiang-occupied areas, skillfully carrying out the struggle against traitors, evil gentry, and for rent and interest reduction. His characteristics are: resourceful, brave, loyal, and skilled in struggle tactics. He understands the psychology and demands of the masses best, and constantly raises the masses' awareness. The article then clearly pointed out: The current central key to the struggle against the enemy lies in carrying out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, calling on border counties to universally launch the Guo Xing Movement, promote his experience, and create more heroes who are "able in both civil and military affairs, resourceful and courageous"!
