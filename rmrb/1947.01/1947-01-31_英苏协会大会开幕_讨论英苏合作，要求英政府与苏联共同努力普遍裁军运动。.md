Liberal Party member of Parliament, Rogers, also spoke of the necessity of Anglo-Soviet understanding. He believes that the future of world peace depends on good relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Rogers believes that if Britain and the Soviet Union had signed an agreement in 1938-39, the world would not have had a war. Rogers declared, "We oppose any moves to strengthen the Anglo-American bloc." After discussion, the congress passed a resolution calling on the British government to work with the Soviet Union on universal disarmament and the control of atomic energy.
