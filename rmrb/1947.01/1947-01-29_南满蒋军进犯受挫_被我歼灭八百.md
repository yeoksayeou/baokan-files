    Southern Manchuria Chiang Troops' Offensive Thwarted
    800 Annihilated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th] The Southern Manchuria Democratic Allied Army once again shattered the Chiang troops' attempt to besiege the Tonghua-Jian area. At the beginning of this month, Chiang troops attacked areas such as Sidaojiang, north of Tonghua, but were repelled by the Democratic Allied Army. On the 18th, the 2nd Division of the Chiang Army's 52nd Corps was pursued to areas such as Jiaohegou, north of Jian. The next day, the 584th Regiment of the 195th Division of the Chiang Army stationed in Tonghua reinforced the area to the south. One of its battalions was completely annihilated when it advanced to Xiaohuanggou (south of Tonghua). At the same time, enemy reinforcements from Toudou Sui zi, Tonghua, heading south were also defeated. In total, over 250 Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded, and over 600 enemy soldiers, including a battalion commander, were captured. Over 40 light and heavy machine guns, over 10 60mm mortars, and over 270 rifles were seized.
