　　Experiences in Training Activists
    In the recent land-to-the-tiller movement, the fifth district of Yanggu utilized a large number of activists through meetings and training, which played a significant role in breaking the deadlock. Now, I would like to share some experiences from the work:
    (1) Who should be summoned for training?
    The comrades in the fifth district agreed that a large number of activists needed to be used to break the deadlock. However, in the initial stage, there were different understandings about who could be trained. Some comrades narrowed the scope too much, only looking for existing activists. This was obviously too demanding. If only this small group of people were trained, not only would they not be able to quickly break the deadlock after returning, but they would also be more easily threatened by feudal forces. Therefore, we proposed that the requirements for attendees should not be too high. As long as they were peasant association members who dared to act today and basic masses with urgent land demands, they could participate. In blank areas, laboreres, the abject poor, and the majority of poor peasants could be mobilized through administrative and Party efforts to participate in the training. Middle peasants with prestige who were not hindering the mass movement could also be absorbed. Only in this way could the policy be understood by more of the basic masses, and more activists could emerge through their mutual inspiration. After this training was completed and they went deep into the villages, it became clear that the more people who came from a village, the faster the work progressed. Many people came from Hulou Yipian Village. After returning, they restored the peasant association, expanded the organization, and opened up key villages in five days. Therefore, it can be affirmed that work should be carried out openly, without fear or hesitation that limits oneself. Only by boldly training activists can the deadlock be quickly broken.
  (2) What issues should be resolved during activist training?
    The experience of the fifth district is to support the activists and let them "get to know the bottom line." In the initial stage of the fifth district activist meeting, what we proposed was not what the activists wanted. When they were asked to deliberate, they had nothing to say. Later, one person said: "As soon as I show my face, the special agents will come after me. After we start working, your cadres leave and never come back. No one is in charge, and everyone collapses. The landlords are waiting for the Central Army every day." From this, we learned their demands. We immediately changed our plan, promptly explained the policy to them, reviewed our shortcomings, showed our support, and explained that the work team and armed work team would live with them and suppress special agents and local bullies to "remove the obstacles." After this, the activists' morale was high, saying: "If it's like this, I dare to do it after I go back." Some immediately poured out their grievances. At the end of the meeting, more than fifty activists voluntarily signed up to temporarily leave production and help with the work.
  (3) Leadership of Activist Meetings
    In the process of the activist meeting, in addition to definitely resolving the issues they raised, throughout the entire meeting, we should not just talk about our own ideas. What we say should only be an inspiration. After the inspiration, small group meetings should be held to allow them to deliberate, with each person expressing their opinions. The cadres participating in the meeting should pay close attention to their opinions, collect them in a timely manner, resolve the problems that need to be solved, clarify the issues that need to be clarified, and then deliberate and summarize again. Only in this way can we combine the demands of the masses with the demands of the leadership, and only then can we implement the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." As for the division of groups, it should not be mechanically divided according to the number of people, but should be handled according to the situation. For example, if a village is needed as a unit, then it is a village; if a group of villages is needed, then it is a group of villages. The allocation of cadres should not be evenly distributed, but should be based on the division of labor of the work group in different regions, participating in each village or group of villages as the best.

### 训练积极分子的经验

　　训练积极分子的经验
    在此次土地还家运动中，阳谷五区，曾以会议方式集训和运用了大批积极分子，对轰开局面起了很大的作用。今将工作中的一点体会，介绍如下：
    （一）召集什么人训练？
    五区的同志，对轰开局面，须大批使用积极分子，认识上是一致的；对什么人可以训练，初期认识上是各不相同的。有的同志把范围缩得很小，只找现成的积极分子，这显然是要求过高。如只训练这一小部分人，他们回去后，不仅不能很快轰开局面，更易被封建势力所威胁。所以我们提出对到会的人不应要求那样高，只要是今天敢干的农会员和土地要求迫切的基本群众即可。在空白区可通过行政、党动员雇工、赤贫、多数贫农来参加受训，中农有威信而不是阻碍群运的分子，亦可吸收。只有这样，政策才能为更多的基本群众所了解，并由于他们的互相启发才能产生更多的积极分子。这次训练完毕，深入农村之后，即显然的看出，那村来的人多，工作就很快的开展起来。胡楼一片村来的人多，回去后五天中就恢复了农会，扩大了组织，打开了重点村。所以肯定的说，工作要放开手，不要怕前怕后，限制了自己；只有大胆的训练了积极分子，才能很快的打开局面。
  （二）在积极分子训练时要解决些什么？
    五区的经验，是要给积极分子撑腰，让他们“摸底”。当五区积极分子开会的初期，我们所提出的有的不是积极分子要求的东西，叫他们去酝酿，他们没有话说。后来一个人说：“俺一露头，特务就找到俺头上来。俺们干起来了，你们干部一去不再来，没人作主，大家就垮了，地主天天盼中央军。”从此知道了他们的要求，我们即转变计划，及时向他们说明政策，检讨我们的缺点，表明撑腰的态度，并说明工作队、武工队与他们住在一块，对特务、奸霸进行镇压，以“搬去石头”。此后，积极分子情绪高涨了，说：“像这样俺回去就敢干了”。有的当场倒起苦水来。在会议结束时，更有五十多积极分子，自动报名，暂时脱离生产，帮助工作。
  （三）积极分子会议的领导
    在积极分子会议进行中，除了肯定的应解决他们要求的问题。在整个会议进行中，不能只是我们讲一套，我们讲的应仅是一个启发，启发之后，要举行小会，让他们你一言我一语的酝酿。参加会议的干部，应该很好的注意他们的意见，及时集中起来，需要解决的问题加以解决，要明确的问题加以明确，然后再酝酿再总结。只有这样，才能做到群众要求与领导要求相结合，才是执行从群众中来，到群众中去的原则。至于小组的划分，不能机械的按人数去分，而应按情况去处理。如需要一个村为单位就是一个村，需要一片村就是一片村；干部的配备，不能平均分配，应按工作组划分地区的分工，参加到各个村或一片村为最好。
