　　【Report from our Changzhi Office】 The militia of Jiaozuo's Third District recently underwent a major discipline inspection, which strengthened the mass awareness of each individual. A conscientious inspection and compensation system has since been established. For example, when stationed in Shuangmiao, some militiamen ate walnuts belonging to the masses. The next day, after a self-criticism by the entire team, they compensated the masses with 1,000 yuan. In Zhongwei Village, when individual militiamen dirtied the courtyards of the masses, everyone mobilized the next day to clean the courtyards for the masses, deeply earning their support. The relationship between the militia and the masses in the district is now very close. For example, the militia stationed in villages such as Beisang Huangling consciously carry water, grind flour, and collect firewood for the masses. When leaders call for saving manpower, the militia volunteer to carry water and move things for military families. They also send cadres to participate in mass work in their areas. They frequently use the feedback from the masses as material for the militia's discipline education. When they transferred to Changling Village, the masses of the village immediately sent people to welcome the militia of the Third District upon hearing of their arrival. The masses invite them to participate in meetings, and when they go to the front lines, the masses rush to help them in the battle.

　　焦作三区民兵守纪
    到处得到群众拥护
    【本报长治讯】焦作三区民兵，最近经过一次纪律大检查，每个人的群众观念都加强了。并从此建立了认真的检查赔偿制度。如住双庙时，部分民兵吃了群众的核桃，第二天经全队检讨即赔了群众一千元钱。在中围村时个别民兵把群众院子弄脏了，第二天大家便动员起来给群众打扫院子，深得群众拥护。现在该区民兵与群众关系非常密切。如驻北桑黄岭等村之该区民兵，自觉给群众担水、推磨、打柴。领导上号召节省民力，民兵就代群众给军属担水搬东西。又抽出干部参加驻地群众工作。经常依据群众反映，作为民兵的纪律教育材料。当转移至长岭村，该村群众听说三区民兵要来，马上派人迎接他们。群众开会请他们参加，他们到前方活动时，群众亦抢着去助战。
