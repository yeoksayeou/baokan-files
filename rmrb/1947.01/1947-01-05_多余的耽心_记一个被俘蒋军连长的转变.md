Unnecessary Worry
    A Record of the Transformation of a Captured KMT Company Commander
    ·Lu Yaowu·
    I watched as our 104th Brigade was squeezed into a few courtyards by the Eighth Route Army. Then a burst of grenades! Our brothers shouted, "Don't shoot! Surrender! Surrender!" Then we heard the clatter of guns being laid down. I thought, "It's over! It's over! We're going to be prisoners! I barely made it through this night of hell, but I can't be captured and tortured to death!" While you were about to rush in, and my company was in complete chaos, I secretly, behind everyone's back, sneaked into a wheat stack.
    Fortunately, your troops didn't pay much attention to it. They were only concerned with guns and cannons, and they hurriedly gathered us together and took us away. My heart gradually stopped pounding, and I thought, "Amitabha! I've passed another hurdle!"
    But after a while, this one came in, then that one came in. I was afraid of another mistake, and I was really on pins and needles. I didn't know if it was wheat chaff all over my body, or some small bugs biting, I gritted my teeth and just dared not move.
    The courtyard was quiet for a while, then suddenly a dog ran in, snuggling up to the wheat stack and barking. I recognized it as the dog of the regiment commander's wife. It ate four chickens a day and knew me. I couldn't let it know I was here. If its claws grabbed at me a few times, its head would be finished. I tried to scare it away. I used my head to push against the wheat, and the wheat stalks fell down with a rustle. That was no good. Two Eighth Route Army soldiers rushed into the yard from behind. I only heard a "Get out of here, you..." and the dog scurried away. A stick hit me on the head with a thud. I didn't care that my head was hot, spicy, and painful, I just thought, "This is it, what else is there to say?" But the two Eighth Route Army soldiers didn't seem to see me at all, and they chased after the dog again, laughing and joking.
    Finally, it was dark! I had to run now. I heard that there were Eighth Route Army soldiers everywhere around me. I thought, "I'll endure it for another night, they'll always run away tomorrow."
    The next day, you didn't run, and Chiang Kai-shek didn't send any troops.
    I dragged on like this, cold, hungry, and scared, until the third day when one of your soldiers was taking a shit behind the wheat stack. I held my breath, breathing lightly and slowly through my nose. Something crawled into my nostril, and I couldn't hold back a sneeze, "Ha!! Choo!" "This time, I'm really done for."
    Strange! That Eighth Route Army soldier talked to me very kindly, telling me not to be afraid, that they wouldn't kill us, and that they would treat us well. "Who would believe your words? You're all sweet at first, then bitter."
    That soldier escorted me to his officer. I thought this time I was finished, either skinned alive or buried alive. Strange? Their officer was also so kind, and also talked about that same line.
    The higher-ups then escorted me to the higher-ups. Every time I was sent to a higher level, I felt like I was being shot with a gun. I always thought I was going to be buried alive this time. Finally, I was sent to some department, and an officer with glasses and a bristly beard came out. He asked:
    "What's your name?"
    I said, "My name is Zhang Degui!"
    "What do you do?"
    "I'm a soldier." I held onto that answer firmly. It would be the same anywhere. Maybe soldiers wouldn't be buried alive.
    That officer from some department stared straight at me with eyes that seemed to swallow me whole, and smiled in a way that seemed like he was about to bury me alive.
    "You're not a soldier, you're an officer. Tell the truth, it's okay."
    I thought, "These cunning bandits are really formidable? They're clearly going to kill me, bury me alive, but their smile is so kind. I have to pretend to be serious, I must not fall for their trick."
    I straightened my face and said seriously, "Officer! You can investigate, I really am a soldier!"
    I saw that he was getting impatient, and he turned around to the soldier behind him with the box cannon: "Guard!"
    Suddenly I felt cold from head to toe. As soon as he gave the order, "Bang!" and it would be over. Being shot was the same as being buried alive!
    But he didn't say anything else. I heard him clearly say to take me down and hand me over to some clerk to deal with.
    Naturally, I breathed a sigh of relief. I could wait until tonight to die. I had one more day to live, so now I'd go to the dark room first.
    The one called "Guard" handed me over to a person who put me in a room without even a door. Naturally, it wasn't locked, no one was guarding me, and the thought of death temporarily left me.
    Bored, I poked my head out to look at the sky, and I had another idea, "Run! Maybe I can escape!" Just then, a woman's figure flashed past the entrance of the street. I knew that figure very well. I thought for a moment, and remembered that it was Tan Zhiming, the wife of Chen Heqiao, the major company commander of our brigade's communications company. She must have been brought here by the "bandit army" to do some ghost business. Poor thing! Her husband was probably lying in the collapsed house in Shangguan Village, with a hole in his head, and her eldest daughter, Xinzhen, and second son, Yuzhen, were probably crying and screaming, with no one to look at them.
    Thinking of this, I forgot my own fear and started to worry about her. Just then, Yin Shufang's figure appeared in my eyes. I thought, "Those hateful bandits, they even brought the wife of Su Baoyuan, the major deputy battalion commander of our mortar battalion. I wonder how many wives they've all ruined!" The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. Coincidentally, Deputy Battalion Commander Su came towards me, holding his child. Strange, he wasn't worried at all, and he was smiling at me. "That shameless beast, his own wife has been taken by others, and he's still grinning with a thick skin!" I couldn't be bothered to pay attention to this kind of person, but he was always a rank above me, so I should still be somewhat polite to him. I said listlessly:
    "You're here too! Where's your wife?"
    What could I say? I could spit in his face, but he was still a rank above me, and I should still be somewhat polite to him. I said listlessly:
    "She's still in Taihe Village, I..." I stopped halfway, I wanted to say, "I would die before letting her come here."
    That guy actually tried to persuade me: "You should still call her here, the Eighth Route Army treats us very well." A fire rose in me, I thought, "Treats us very well, sending your wife to comfort them, they'll treat her with sausage and milk, pushing you into the cold hell, and pulling your wife into the warm house." But these words were hard to say to his face, I just kept silent, looking down and fiddling with my buttons.
    He seemed too excited, and happily chattered on. He talked about when he was captured—no, he's learned to say 'laid down his weapons' now—his wife wasn't with him, and at first, he was also quite scared. He saw many colleagues bringing their wives and children, some of the Eighth Route Army soldiers put their children on their shoulders to take them away, some of the Eighth Route Army led the men to find their wives, and some led the wives to find their men. Even as prisoners, families could still be reunited. He said that Chen Heqiao was the one who ended up with his wife and children scattered. After it was cleared up that someone old was his nanny, she was sent back to him, and his eldest daughter, Xinzhen, was also sent back to him. As for his youngest daughter, Yuzhen? Someone had already found a wet nurse for her for a day, but as soon as they heard that he had lost his child, they sent her back. He said, putting his face close to his child's face, "This little darling of mine was also sent back to me. They also led me back to Dahe Village and found Shufang (his wife)." I suddenly realized what the shadows fluttering outside the door were all about. But the more I learned, the more confused I became. Could this really be true?
    He saw through that I was still thinking it over, so he stood up, grabbed my right hand, and pulled me into a courtyard. Ah! How lively it was! Right away I ran into Ai Junhao, the director of the telephone bureau, his wife and children, Lou Hanxiang, the platoon leader of the communications company, with his wife and daughter. There were about twenty or thirty couples, plus big kids and little kids, shouting, calling, laughing, and making noise, like a big family of five generations. All of a sudden, all my prejudices were shattered. Son of a bitch, those quack political workers of ours, everything they said in the past was all lies! I thought I had to quickly find my wife, so I turned around, took three steps as two, and barged into the room of that bespectacled Eighth Route Army officer. I had lied to him before, preparing to be scolded first. I stood straight and shouted "Report!"
    From inside came the reply, "Come in! What is it?" He was sorting through documents, and didn't seem to be planning on paying attention to me.
    I took a step forward, and said embarrassedly:
    "Reporting officer! I'm not a soldier, I'm the company commander of the 104th Brigade's 2nd Mortar Company."
    "Ah! You're Company Commander Zhang?" He raised his head, his eyes even more like nails pinning me down.
    "No, that's all nonsense!" I'm not called Zhang Degui, I'm called Chen Jun. At first, I was afraid you'd bury me alive, so I made up a story, but now..." I didn't care if he was listening or not, I told him my thoughts one by one, and finally asked him to solve a problem for me, to find my wife and bring her here too.
    He became impatient again, his mouth closed tightly, and he quickly flipped through a booklet—like a roster—finally stopping at a place in that booklet, finding a piece of paper, scribbling on it for a while, and stuffing it into my hand, saying to the one with the box cannon
    "Take him to the reception center!"
    God! Did I run into another unlucky thing!? I didn't dare to think any further. With a trembling hand, I opened that piece of paper, which read:
    "Comrade Section Chief: The female prisoner named Zhou in your place, her husband Chen Jun, has been identified, so just let them be together..."
    My heart, like a stone, plummeted. I just felt that I had been laughably stupid these past few days.

    多余的耽心
    记一个被俘蒋军连长的转变
    ·卢耀武·
    我看着看着，我们一○四旅的人都叫八路军给挤到几个院子里了，一阵手榴弹响！我们弟兄们就喊：“不打啦！缴枪！缴枪！”接着就听见哗哗啦啦的放下枪的声音。我想：“完啦！完啦！我们也得当俘虏了！好容易熬过了这一夜的鬼门关，可不能叫捉去，给活活的整死！”我乘你们就要冲进来，我们连里人正下的乱成一团糟，我就背过大家的眼睛，悄悄的钻进了一个麦＠堆里。
    还好，你们队伍都不在意这会事儿，他们都只顾枪炮，马马虎虎把我们的人一集合就带走了。我心里就慢慢慢慢不扑通了，心里想：“阿弥陀佛！又过了一关！”
    可是一会儿，这个进来了，一会儿那个又进来了，我生怕再出了差错，浑身上下，真是＠瘘的难过。也不知道是麦＠屑屑弄满了身子，还是啥小虫虫在咬，我咬紧牙关只是不敢动弹。
    院子本来静悄了一会儿，突然间跑来了一只狗，身子直偎着麦＠堆汪汪的咬，我听出来这是＠团长太太的那只狗。它一天要吃四只鸡的，它是认得我的，可不敢叫它知道我在这儿，它两只爪子只要抓它几抓，脑袋就都休想要了，我试试＠跑它看，我就用头隔着麦＠往外顶，麦＠杆哗哗的往下落，可不好了，两个八路军从后边赶进院里。我刚听了个“去你妈的……”那狗嗖的一声跑开了。梆的一棒就扔到我头上，我顾不上脑袋又热又辣又疼，只是在想：“这一下完了，还说个啥？”可是那两个八路军，好像一点也没有看见我，又嘻嘻哈哈追狗去了。
    总算是天黑啦！这下子可得跑啦，我听周围，满是八路军，我想：“再熬他一夜，明天他们总是要跑的。”
    第二天你们也没有跑，蒋委员长也没有兵来。
    这样又冷，又饿，又怕，拖到第三天，你们的
  一个战士在麦＠堆后拉屎，我屏着气，轻轻地慢慢地用鼻子在呼吸。一个啥家伙钻进鼻孔里，我实在忍耐不住“呵！！铁”打了一个大喷嚏，“这一下子可真该报销了。”
    真怪！那个八路军的兵满和气的跟我谈话，叫我不要怕，他们不杀我们，优待我们。“鬼才会相信你的话，你们都是先甜后辣。”
    那个兵，把我押送给他的官长，我想这会总该完蛋啦，不是剥皮就是活埋。真怪？他们官长也是那样和气，也是谈了那一套。
     上级又把我押送给上级，每送上一级，我就像挨了一火枪毙一样的。我总想这回可要活埋了。最后把我送到一个什么部里
  ，出来了一个戴着眼镜，胡子八叉的官长。他问：
   “你叫啥？”
    我说：“我叫张得贵！”
   “你是干什么的？”
   “我是当兵的。”我死咬住这一口，到那里也是一个样，当兵也许不会给活埋的。
    那个什么部的官长，用要吞下我的眼睛，直挺挺的盯着我，像是就要把我活埋似的鬼笑了一下说
    “你不是个当兵的，你是个军官，说实话吧，没有事情的。”
    我想：“这奸匪真厉害？明明就要杀我，活埋我，可是笑起来真像满和善的。我也得装的正经些，千万不敢上他的当。”
    我把脸板着认真的说：“官长！可以调查的，我确确实实是个兵！”
    我看见他有些不耐烦了，回头叫他背后背盒子枪的兵：“警卫员！”
    一下子我就从头冷到脚梢，只要他的命令一发，“嘣！”可就完蛋了。枪毙不跟活埋都是一个球样！
    可是他并没有说别的，我听的清清楚楚，他说叫把我带下去，交给一个什么干事去处理。
    自然我松了一口气，我可以等到晚上再去死。我有着一天的活命，现在我先去黑屋子去。
    那叫做“警卫员”的随从兵，把我交给一个人，那个人把我放到连门也没有的房里，自然就不会锁上了，也没有人管，也没有人放哨，死的念头，暂时离开了。
    闷得无聊，我探出头，看看天，我又打主意了，“跑吧！也许跑得脱！
  ”正是这时候，从街门口，一个女人的背影一闪过去了，这个背影，我熟得很，我揣想了一下，想起这是谭芝明，我们旅通讯连少校连长陈鹤乔的太太
  。她一定是叫“匪军”弄
  来搞鬼名堂的，可怜啊！她的男人，也许正躺在上官村炸塌的房里，头上留个窟窿，她的大女儿新真，二儿豫真，也许正哇哇的哭叫，没有人去看他们一眼。
  想到这里，我忘记了自己的害怕，专门替她担忧开了，正在这时候尹淑芳的背影又出现在我的眼里，我想：“可恶的奸匪，把我们迫击炮少校副营长苏葆元的太太也弄来了，不知道有多少太太都叫他们给糟塌哩！”我心里横七竖八越想越气，可巧苏副营长迎面抱着他的小孩来了，奇怪他一点不发愁，满面笑容向我走来。这个无耻畜牲，自己老婆都叫人家去搞了，自己还死皮不要脸的吱着牙齿笑哩！”我懒得答理这号子人，他却笑嘻嘻的跑到我跟前先对我答腔了：“你也来啦！你的太太哩？”
    你叫我怎么说呢？我唾他一脸可是他总是吧！大我一级，我还是应该有些礼儿去应付他的，我没精打彩的说：
   “她还在太和村，我……”我说了半截就收住了，我是想说：“我死也不会叫他来这儿”。
    那家伙居然劝起我来：“还是叫她来吧，八路军待咱们挺好的。”我一股火冒起来，我想：“挺好挺好的，把你的太太送去慰劳人家，人家会用香肠牛奶招待她，把你可推到冷冰冰的地狱里，把你的太太拉到暖烘烘的屋子里。”可是这些话，不好当他的脸说出口，我只是不作声，把头低着，摆弄着我的扣子。
    他好像太兴奋了，高兴得叨叨下去，他讲他被俘时——不，他现在也学会什么‘放下武器’时，他的太太没在跟前，起初自己也挺怕，见有许多同事带着太太抱着小孩，有的八路军把他们的小孩骑到自己的肩上送他们走，有的八路军领着男的找太太，有的领太太找男人。当了俘虏，家庭还能团圆。他说陈鹤乔就是弄得妻离子散，人家给他清查出老娑送回来了，又给他送回来了大女儿新真，他的小女儿豫真呢？人家都找下奶妈养了一天了，一听说他丢了小孩，又给送来了，他说到这里，用脸偎到自己的小孩脸上说：“我这个小乖乖也是人家送回来的，人家又领我回到大和村找到了淑芳（是他的老婆）。”我忽然想起门外幌来幌去的人影是怎么回事儿了。但我也越弄越糊涂，这难道是真的？
    他看透我在转弯子，就站了起来，一把抓住我的右手，拉我走到一个院子里，啊！多么热烈呀，劈头就撞见了电话总局艾俊豪所长他的太太和孩子，通讯连娄汗祥排长跟他的太太和闺女，这样正正有二三十对，加上大娃娃小娃娃，喊的、叫的、笑的、闹的，真像一个五世同堂的大家庭，一下子把我的一切成见都打破了。婊子养的，我们那些卖狗皮膏药的政工人员，过去说的都是瞎话！我想起要快快的找回我的老婆来，因之我回转身子，三步并成两步，闯进那位带眼镜的八路军官长房里。我先前哄过他，准备先挨一顿骂，我立的端端正正喊了声“报告！”
    里边说：“进来吧！什么事呢！”他整理着文件，似乎没打算答理我。
    我跨进了一步，不好意思的说：
    “报告官长！我不是个兵，我是一○四旅迫击炮第二连连长。”
    “啊！你是张连长？”他抬起头来，眼睛更加像钉子钉着我。
    “不，那都是瞎扯！”我不叫张得贵，我叫陈俊。起初我怕你们活埋，就胡诌了一套，现在……”我顾不得他听不听，我一五一十的说出我的心思来，最后要求他给我解决一个困难，把我的老婆也找到这里来。
    他又不耐烦起来，嘴闭的紧紧的，用手很快的翻着一本小册子——像是花名册——最后在那本本上一个地方停下来，找到了一块纸，在上面喳喳的划了一会儿，塞到我手里，对那个背盒子枪的说
    “带他到收容所里！”
    天啊！又撞见＠倒霉事了呢！？我不敢再想下去，我用擅抖的手，打开那张纸，那上面写着：
   “×科长：你们那里姓周的女俘虏，他的男人陈俊清查出来了，就叫他们在一起好了……”
    我的心像块石头一样，朴通一下子落下来啦，我只觉得我自己这几天真是蠢得可笑。
