Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji) 29th: The military and civilians of Eastern Hebei have also recovered many villages and towns occupied by Chiang's puppet troops. Earlier this month, Chiang's puppet troops in Shunyi and Miyun continuously "nibbled" and invaded the area west of the Ping-Cheng Railway. The local Eighth Route Army and militia rose up to resist. Since the 6th of this month, they have successively recovered more than 50 villages and towns, large and small, including Henan Village under Shunyi and Shuiyu Village under Miyun, disintegrating more than 220 puppet "General Assemblies." Another unit of the Eighth Route Army recovered multiple Chiang army strongholds between the 16th and 18th of this month, including Lug 각 Zhuang, Xiao Chen Zhuang, Qili Tun west of Fengrun, and Yincheng Pu ten miles east of Fengrun, annihilating more than 100 Chiang soldiers and seizing two machine guns and over 100 rifles. On the 15th, a guerrilla team ambushed the enemy at Muzhuangzi, more than 20 miles southwest of Ji County. As a result of the battle, more than ten enemy soldiers, including a squad leader, were killed or captured.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast 29th: A unit of the Democratic Allied Army, which persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in Western Manchuria, annihilated a battalion of the 87th Division of Chiang's army on the 17th in the area 50 miles west of Changling in Liaobei Province. At the same time, a unit of the Democratic Allied Army, active behind enemy lines in Southern Manchuria, recovered the two strongholds of Songshan Fort and Fuguan Office west of Jiayan in Andong Province (both east of Tonghua) on the 16th, repelling Chiang's army that was advancing eastward to the Liudaogou Gate. In the above battles, 530 Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded, and 310 were captured.
