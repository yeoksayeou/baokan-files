Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe
    New Democratic Nations are Growing Stronger
    Actively Carrying Out Economic Reconstruction
    Czechoslovakia Completes Nationalization of Large Industries
    Yugoslavia Repairs 1,000 Kilometers of Railways
    [This newspaper dispatch] A comprehensive TASS dispatch: New democratic countries in Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe are growing stronger, the foundations of democratic regimes are being consolidated, and they are working hard on post-war reconstruction.
    In Yugoslavia, 250,000 houses were rebuilt last year, 1,000 kilometers of railways were repaired, and 100 new factories and enterprises were created. This year, national industrialization and electrification will be implemented. Montenegro, one of Yugoslavia's federated republics, adopted the constitution of the republic at a constitutional assembly on the 5th, and the constitutional assembly became a formal parliament; Blais Vanovic formed a new government and gave a speech emphasizing that the constitution of the People's Republic of Montenegro is based on the system of the Yugoslav national constitution and correctly resolves national issues.
    In Czechoslovakia, the two-year economic plan will be completed in 1947. The first year of the economic plan was the nationalization of many large industries. Klement Gottwald, leader of the Czech Communist Party, emphasized that the task of the two-year economic plan is to improve the people's affluent life and consolidate the foundations of the democratic regime and national independence.
    Bulgaria is currently busy drafting a new constitution, expanding the economic foundation of democracy, stipulating that mineral resources, mines, railways, and transportation be nationalized, and guaranteeing workers' right to work. The Bulgarian Supreme Economic Council will complete the two-year economic plan on the 15th. The chairman of the council, Tebosev, told reporters on the 10th: "One of the biggest designs in the plan is to build a new worker city on the banks of the Maritsa River and to establish an artificial fertilizer plant, a cement plant, and a power station that generates 50,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the city." Last year, Bulgaria established six new rubber factories, three glass factories, and several oil refineries, and also opened several large middle schools. Unemployment has disappeared.
    The Romanian Supreme Economic Council is discussing the national reconstruction plan, and the National Bank is jointly composed of representatives from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Farmers' Front, and other parties to form a new board of directors. The Ministry of Agriculture is drafting several laws related to the vital interests of farmers, such as "Prohibition of Free Sale of Land," "Agricultural Workers' Association," and "Agricultural Loans." In Poland, preparations are underway for the parliamentary elections on January 19. The Democratic Political Party Alliance has jointly put forward the slogan of the election campaign, implementing the three-year plan for the development of the national economy, which occupies an important position. The security organs also arrested a group of fascist remnants who sabotaged the election. The working class and all working people of New Poland are enthusiastically participating in the reconstruction work.
