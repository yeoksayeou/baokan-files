Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: The *Liberation Daily* published an editorial on the 24th, supporting the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government's designation of November 4th (the day the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the US government signed the *Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation*) as China's National Humiliation Memorial Day, and calling on all sectors of the country and the military and civilians of the liberated areas to strive for the complete abolition of this traitorous treaty and the washing away of this new national humiliation.

The editorial pointed out: "The Chiang-American Commercial Treaty is a traitorous treaty ten times more harsh than the Twenty-One Demands of Yuan Shikai and Japan. If it is allowed to be implemented, our country will inevitably face national subjugation and racial extermination. After signing this commercial treaty, Chiang Kai-shek continued to sign supplementary agreements such as the *Sino-American Aviation Agreement*, further selling out the country. On the other hand, he convened the 'National Assembly' and formulated the 'Democratic Constitution.' His purpose is to make himself more pleasing to the American reactionaries, obtain support, wage a large-scale civil war, and maintain his fascist dictatorship." "And the American imperialists, after their 'mediation' failed, 'are more inclined to fully support the Kuomintang' (as stated in *Life* magazine). They ordered Chiang Kai-shek to support the civil war against the CCP, attempting to turn China into a second Philippines."

The editorial finally discussed the great victory of the nationwide student patriotic movement and the patriotic war of the military and civilians in the liberated areas that erupted at the end of last year due to the rape of Chinese female students by American soldiers, saying: This is "the united will of the Chinese people, and this will is bound to overwhelm any reactionaries!" "The decision of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government will undoubtedly further motivate the people in the liberated areas and throughout China to rise up and fight for the complete abolition of the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty and all traitorous treaties, the cancellation of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorial policies, and the severe punishment of traitors, and we will not stop until we achieve our goals!"

    陕甘宁边府定十一月四日为国耻日
    解放日报著论拥护
    号召国人为洗雪新国耻而奋斗
    【新华社延安二十五日电】解放日报二十四日发表社论，拥护陕甘宁边区政府规定每年十一月四日（卖国贼蒋介石与美国政府所订《中美通商航海条约》签字日）为我国国耻纪念日，并号召全国各界同胞及解放区军民，为彻底废除这一卖国条约与洗雪新国耻而奋斗。
    社论指出：“蒋美商约是比袁日二十一条更为苛酷十倍的卖国条约。如任其实行，则我国非至亡国灭种不可。蒋介石在签订这个商约之后，一面继续签订《中美航空协定》等补充卖身文契，另一面又召开“国大”，制定《民主宪法》。其目的是在于使美国反动派看得更入眼，取得支援，大打内战，维持其法西斯独裁。”“而美国帝国主义者在其‘调处’失败后，‘更趋向全力支持国民党’（美生活杂志语）。命令蒋介石把对中共的内战好好撑持下去，企图把中国变成菲律宾第二。”
    社论最后论及去年年底由美兵奸污中国女生所爆发的全国学生爱国运动及解放区军民爱国战争的伟大胜利时称：这是“中国人民的联合意志，这个意志是必然要压倒任何反动派的！”“陕甘宁边区政府的决定，无疑地将更加推动解放区和全中国人民，更加奋发起来，为彻底废除蒋美商约及一切卖国条约、取消蒋介石卖国独裁政策、严惩卖国贼而斗争，不达目的誓不休止！”
