　　Chiang Kai-shek Troops Risk Invasion of Southern Hebei
    Eight Million People Will Surely Annihilate Them
    Statement by Spokesperson of Southern Hebei Military Region
    [This newspaper, Weixian, Southern Hebei, 8th dispatch] Following the Chiang Kai-shek troops' occupation of Daming, the war has expanded to Southern Hebei. The spokesperson of the Southern Hebei Military Region issued a statement saying: Chiang Kai-shek's troops' occupation of Daming will inevitably be met with the resolute resistance of the people in the liberated areas. The people and soldiers of Southern Hebei have eight years of experience defeating the Japanese invaders. After nearly half a year of land reform, the peasants have been fully mobilized and fully awakened, possessing the determination and strength to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Cadres and eight million people throughout the region have made full preparations to "stay in their counties, stay in their districts." Wherever the Chiang Kai-shek troops go, mass guerrilla warfare will develop, making them unable to sleep or eat in peace. At the same time, the iron fists of our main force will strike. It can be asserted that the fate of Chiang Kai-shek's troops after invading Southern Hebei will inevitably be even more tragic.

　　蒋军冒险侵入冀南
    八百万人民必予痛歼
    冀南军区发言人谈话
    【本报冀南威县八日电】蒋军侵占大名后，战争已扩展到冀南，冀南军区发言人发表谈话称：蒋军侵占大名，他所能得到的必然是解放区人民的坚决抵抗。冀南军民有八年战败日寇的经验，经过近半年来的土地改革，农民已充分发动，充分觉悟，具有粉碎蒋介石进攻决心和力量。全区干部及八百万人民都已作了“县不离县、区不离区”的充分准备，蒋军走到那里，群众性的游击战便会开展到那里，使他寝食不安。同时我主力军铁拳的挥击，可以断言蒋介石军队侵入冀南后的命运，必然更加悲惨。
