    Celebrating a Year of Victorious Battles
    Du Ba Lian Militia Grand Review
    Night Exercise Scares Away Jiang's Troops from Potou
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 26th] Du Ba Lian, the Taiyue people's banner of struggle and the river defense fortress, foiled 187 attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops throughout the past year, killing and wounding 139 enemies, and rescuing more than 600 civilians. To celebrate these victories, Du Ba Lian held a celebration rally on the 14th of this month. Hero Xue Pinghua and others led the battle-hardened militia and self-defense forces into the venue in high spirits. Xue Pinghua said, "We have been fighting Chiang Kai-shek's army for a year to defend our homeland. This year, relying on everyone's hard work, bravery, and unity, we have defeated Chiang Kai-shek's 187 attacks. In order to defend the fruits of our liberation and completely defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we must work even harder, be braver, and be more united in the future." This was followed by a grand review, with the magnificent militia joint defense team marching past the statue of Chairman Mao, greeted by warm cheers and applause from the masses. A night exercise was held, with bugle calls, gunshots, and thunderous sounds resounding, scaring the Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed at Potou into fleeing to the west bank of the Yellow River to take cover.
