　　Huixian Peasants Who Have Overturned Their Lives
    Launch a Weapon Donation Campaign
    Donate Machine Guns to Defend the Good Times
    [Report from our newspaper in Huixian] In order to defend the good times, the peasants of Huixian who have turned over a new leaf have launched a weapon donation campaign. ××, a member of the Xipingluo Farmers' Association, accepted two anti-aircraft machine guns from the Kuomintang troops in 1943 and hid them at home. Fearing that the Chiang army would come back for them, he dared not speak out. This year, in the winter school, he cleared his mind and voluntarily donated them, saying, "Donate weapons, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and defend our good times." Huo Jian, the village chief of Hebei Village, and Wang Xian, a primary school teacher, also donated the Type 38 rifles and "Golden Hook" rifles they brought back when they were puppet soldiers. ×× from Qingshuiping donated a radio receiver. Other villages are also enthusiastically launching this campaign. (Jiang Qing)

　　辉县翻身农民
    展开献武器运动
    献出机关枪  保卫好时光
    【本报辉县讯】为了保卫好时光，辉县翻身农民展开献武器运动。西平罗农会会员××，在四三年曾接受国民党部队高射机枪两挺，暗藏家内，怕蒋军回来要，始终不敢说。今年冬学里，他打通了思想，自动献出来说：“献出武器，打垮蒋介石，保卫咱的好时光。”河北村村长霍简、小学教员王贤、也献出了当伪军时带回的三八式和金钩枪。清水坪××献出收报机一架。其他各村也正热烈展开此一运动。（江清）
