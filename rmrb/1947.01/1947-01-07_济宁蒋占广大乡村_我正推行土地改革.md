(This report from the Ji-Lu-Yu [冀鲁豫] area, dated the 3rd of this month) In the vast countryside of Jining under Chiang's occupation, under the leadership of our democratic government, a land reform movement has unfolded. In the Fourth District, which is very close to the city, village cadres gathered to study land reform and war mobilization work. A village cadre from × village said: "Although we are often disturbed by the enemy, we fight them when they come, and when they don't come, we can peacefully divide the land." A cadre from × village said: "We must complete this work within two weeks. We are competing with × village." Several villages in the Third Subdistrict also perked up, saying together: "We can't fall behind others. Our armed forces will definitely protect the masses as they stand up!"

    济宁蒋占广大乡村
    我正推行土地改革
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】济宁蒋占区广大乡村，在我民主政府领导下，展开了土地改革运动。离城很近的四区，各村干部集会研究土地改革和战争动员工作。×村村干说：“俺那里虽然时常有敌人扰乱，但是敌人来了我们就打，敌人不来我们可以安心分地”。×庄干部说：“一定要在两个星期内完成这一工作，俺与×庄比赛”。三小区的几个村庄也鼓起了劲，一齐说：“咱可不能落在人家后头，咱的武装一定保卫群众翻身”。
