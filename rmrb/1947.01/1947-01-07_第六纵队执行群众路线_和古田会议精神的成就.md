The Sixth Column of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army is a relatively young unit in our region. In the past, it had a heavy burden due to poor combat performance and poor mass work. Since the July Self-Defense War, they have strived to improve, completing the tasks assigned by their superiors each time, achieving great military feats, and receiving multiple commendations from the military region. They have rapidly caught up with and even surpassed older units in improving combat effectiveness and in all aspects of their work. This is a leap forward. What caused this rapid progress? It is because they responded to the instructions and calls of the Central Bureau, implementing Chairman Mao's mass line and the spirit of the Gutian Conference in all aspects of army work. The Wang Keqin movement was created and developed in the early stages of their column's implementation of the spirit of the Gutian Conference and the mass line.

After the Shangdang-Pinghan Campaign, they conducted a grievance-airing and revenge movement in the troops. Many liberated KMT soldiers accused the feudal, comprador, warlord, and bully landlords of enslaving and exploiting them. After pouring out their grievances, their class consciousness and political awareness increased, and they sincerely wanted to join the People's Liberation Army. Soldiers and cadres who joined from the liberated areas, after recalling their own process of liberation and emancipation, were even more determined to follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao forever. One squad leader, through his own account of his emancipation and awakening process, educated and influenced five newly liberated KMT soldiers in his squad. From then on, this squad had the highest morale and the best unity between new and old soldiers, showing vigor and vitality. When this mass force was reflected to the column's Party Committee (the highest leading body of the column, the leadership center of the column), it attracted serious attention from the leading comrades. They carefully studied and summarized the experience of this squad, and immediately popularized this experience to the entire column to transform the newly liberated KMT soldiers and establish a profound understanding of the people's army among all officers and soldiers. This greatly improved the combat strength and the spirit of unity and fraternity of the Sixth Column.

When the KMT troops launched a large-scale offensive against our liberated areas, the Sixth Column held mobilization rallies and determination rallies for the patriotic self-defense war. At this time, the Column Party Committee put forward the goal of fighting well, training well, and maintaining good mass discipline, as the goal for which the column would strive. In order to transform this leading ideology into the ideology of the masses and make the masses consciously strive, it was also proposed that: everyone should offer ideas, everyone should think of solutions, and discussions on combat, training, mass discipline, and the summarization of various experiences should start from the squad, platoon, and company levels. The Column Party Committee then absorbed everyone's opinions and made conclusions or orders to be implemented below. If there were difficulties in implementation (combat orders were to be resolutely implemented first), opinions were solicited again, discussed again, concentrated again, and then handed down for implementation. The soldiers and the masses, as well as lower-level cadres, felt that the orders were reasonable, that there were methods for combat and training, and that they were eager to do everything, while the leadership felt relaxed and happy. Since the leaders implemented the practice of concentrating and improving everyone's opinions and methods, they felt that their wisdom and ability had improved, that they had solutions for everything, and that everyone was united and single-minded in seeking progress every day, unlike in the past when they were always having "moods." As a result of the implementation of this method, the work of the Sixth Column became active in all aspects and achieved great progress.

In terms of combat, the column learned to first present the combat tasks given by the superiors and introduce the current situation of the enemy, and then, instead of talking about how to fight, it first launched a mass mobilization and discussion from the bottom up. Many commanders and fighters were able to offer many valuable opinions. In particular, the soldiers newly liberated from the KMT provided many ways to overcome our army's weaknesses, break through enemy bunkers, wooden fences, deer villages, break through enemy villages, and avoid enemy artillery fire. For example, they pointed out that our army was not quiet enough at night, shouted slogans too early, and that the formation was too dense when destroying obstacles, resulting in too many casualties, etc. They understood the characteristics and weaknesses of the KMT troops most thoroughly, and the countermeasures they proposed were the most practical. These opinions were quickly concentrated to the regiment, brigade, and column, and then introduced to various units and practiced in the field, and applied to combat. In one instance, a certain company, which was assigned a task of assault, adopted this new tactic, which was pointed out by the newly liberated soldiers and carefully studied, and compared with the past, it reduced casualties by twenty-eight percent. The troops' confidence in victory and the certainty of winning battles were greatly improved. In particular, the new soldiers greatly reduced their ideological fear of the enemy's so-called American weaponry and solid fortifications, and increased their courage and strength to fight. The troops were thus more consolidated, and morale was higher. Every individual and every unit competed to put forward their own combat plans, and a widespread new heroism competition was launched. In one battle, two cooks of a certain regiment proposed a plan not only to ensure that everyone would not go hungry during the battle, but also to capture five guns. As a result, they fully achieved their goals. This is the most important achievement of the Sixth Column's political work.

Regarding training, they learned the method of mass training and the combination of training and combat. Immediately after the end of the battle, a self-examination of the battle was carried out from the bottom up, from the individual to the squad to the platoon to the entire column, and the opinions of the newly liberated soldiers were widely absorbed. The weaknesses and strengths of our army were quickly discovered, and methods to overcome weaknesses and promote strengths were studied. "Sweat more, bleed less" became a common slogan. Some soldiers said to the cadres: "You often say that officers and soldiers are united, love soldiers, and take care of soldiers' lives. We feel this is very good, but the greatest care for soldiers is when the cadres have high tactics and good command, and fewer people die in battle." This also prompted the cadres to learn humbly and improve themselves. The soldiers generally made the most of their skills, while the higher levels were responsible for summarizing and improving techniques consistently from top to bottom, opposing all forms and dogmas, and everything was for the actual needs of combat. For example, in order to adapt to the need to troubleshoot weapons during night battles, they practiced disassembling weapons with their eyes closed. In order to attack bunkers, they actually built a bunker for practice, and conducted various night combat exercises. In training, they adopted the method of teaching and demonstrating at the same time, speaking less and doing more. Many commanders were always formulaic, but sincerely and often said: "The opinions you put forward are much better than my own comments. I can't even think of such a thorough job." The result was often that everyone put forward many good ideas and good methods. Because of the commanders' humble spirit of learning from the lower levels and the masses, they constantly improved their tactical skills, and the soldiers and the masses increased their confidence, feeling that this was the most profound care for them from their superiors who thought highly of them. As a result, opinions became more unified, every action received consistent views from top to bottom, and greater effectiveness could be exerted on the battlefield. In this way, the mass line of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching soldiers, and old soldiers teaching new soldiers was truly achieved. The entire army's enthusiasm for training soared to an unprecedented level, braving the severe winter ice and snow day and night, and working hard to practice their skills.

Regarding mass work, they discovered from the new soldiers (emancipated peasants) that the most painful thing for the common people was the heavy burden of civilian labor mobilization, so they paid special attention to protecting and cherishing civilian labor and establishing contact with the masses. At the beginning of the self-defense war, they needed an average of 110 carts per brigade. Later, after everyone's automatic reflection and discussion, it was reduced to 19 carts. Simply by implementing this one item, their relationship with the masses was greatly improved. Every time they arrived at a place, they investigated and studied the people's reflections on the army, what they liked, and what they opposed. They made instructions based on these reflections, ordered the entire army to implement them, and regularly reflected on their relationship with the masses to see if there was anything they had done to let the masses down. If so, they would change it, and this became the norm. After a certain brigade captured a certain city, the mass discipline was so good that they did not violate the slightest thing, and they received a commendation from the military region. The heroic deeds of the Wang Keqin squad in rescuing the masses in battle can also be used as an example.

In the process of implementing this mass line, they discovered Wang Keqin, an activist and typical example. Wang Keqin was a model of unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and mutual learning. As a result, the Wang Keqin's mutual assistance movement was rapidly and widely launched, which played a huge role in improving the new soldiers in the liberated areas, uniting and transforming the liberated KMT soldiers. The best proof is that in December, the Sixth Column supplemented 2,000 new liberated KMT soldiers, and only three of them deserted in a month. In return, in this hot mass movement, the cadres of the Sixth Column realized the greatness of the mass strength and recognized that only the masses are the most intelligent and have the most solutions. Therefore, they also accelerated their own progress, transformation, and improvement. The cadres became more humble, always wanting to ask the soldiers and ask the lower levels for their opinions, and cared more about the soldiers. A certain leading comrade said: "We don't have much ability, we rely entirely on everyone to come up with ideas and find solutions, and everyone to work hard." These were sincere words. Their organs were very streamlined, and they often "sang the empty city strategy." Leading personnel from the column to the regiment and battalion levels were frequently in the lower levels understanding the situation, summarizing experiences, inspecting and promoting work, discovering good experiences and quickly promoting, spreading, and reporting them, and using many methods to promote them. Not only in combat and training, but also in other areas, such as performing plays, fast board reports, and pictorials, they also adopted the mass line and did a good job. The cadres' morale was high, they felt relaxed and happy at work, and work efficiency greatly increased. The cadres and cadres, the troops and the troops, and the superiors and subordinates were very united. If there was a problem, they would conduct self-criticism and quickly overcome it. They had gradually realized the greatness of the mass strength and developed a habit: that if they left the masses and left the discussion and research with everyone to find solutions, they would seem to have nothing.

In the past six months, the leaders of the Sixth Column have attached importance to the mass line, and mass viewpoints have gained major progress in all aspects. This is mainly because they have learned and continue to learn to come from the masses and go to the masses, to combine leadership with the masses, and to have a new style of seeking truth from facts. The experience of the past six months has proved that only by implementing the mass line can we give full play to the enthusiasm, wisdom, and creativity of the masses, quickly accept new things and good models, discover and unite activists, combat heroes, and model workers, and make the troops, especially the cadres, transformed and improved. The experience of the past six months has proved that all progress can only be generated from overcoming the Gorylov's viewpoint and dogmatism; due to the widespread implementation of the grievance-airing and revenge mass movement, all officers and soldiers clearly recognized the essence of the people's army, greatly increased their hatred for the reactionary rulers, and enhanced their determination to defend the fruits of the people's struggle. This made all officers and soldiers ideologically completely unified, united under the party's current struggle tasks, and united under the banner of Mao Zedong; due to the implementation of the mass movement regardless of old or new soldiers, achieving knowing yourself and knowing your enemy, being able to quickly overcome weaknesses, promote strengths, improve technology, and recognize the enemy's weaknesses, making political and technical integration, some blind fears and negative manifestations were replaced by invincible strength and courage; due to the establishment of sound Party Committees at all levels on the basis of implementing the mass line, establishing a collective leadership system, establishing leading backbones, and promoting democratic style, they were able to realize the party's correct leadership line, ideological leadership, and new leadership methods, making the unity of the army and the party, the army and the people, officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates closer, political work and military work coordinated, and the direction of political work and the direction of the entire army work completely consistent. Everything that the Sixth Column has implemented above is the practical embodiment of Chairman Mao's mass viewpoint, mass line leadership method in the work of the army, which is completely in line with Chairman Mao's direction. Other military corps have also made great achievements in their work in the implementation of Chairman Mao's mass line leadership methods and the spirit of the Gutian Conference. However, we have not yet obtained more complete materials, and we will add further summary and improvement later.

We celebrate the development and progress of the Sixth Column and highly value this new harvest. This is a new direction in the construction of the people's army, a major reform in political work, a restoration of the spirit of the Gutian Conference, and the achievements of our party's rectification campaign and the Seventh National Congress. But this is only the beginning and an extremely preliminary development of Chairman Mao's thought in the army work in our region. We believe that it is still far from enough. We call on all troops in the region to bravely advance in this direction, continue to carry forward Chairman Mao's thought, accelerate the progress of the troops, continue to summarize and improve experience, so that the combat effectiveness of our People's Liberation Army will be universally improved, and then we will win more and greater victories!

    第六纵队执行群众路线
    和古田会议精神的成就
    晋冀鲁豫人民解放军第六纵队是本区比较年轻的兵团，过去它曾因作战较差和群众工作不好背过很重的包袱，七月自卫战争以来，他们力求进步，每次均完成了上级所给予的任务，创立巨大战功，多次获得军区嘉奖，在提高战斗力上，在工作的各方面，都迅速赶上甚至超过了较老兵团，这是一个飞跃的进步。什么原因促进他们这种迅速的进步呢？就是因为他们响应中央局的指示和号召，把毛主席的群众路线和领导方法古田会议的精神贯彻到军队工作中的各方面去，王克勤运动就是他们纵队实行古田会议的精神实行群众路线，在初期所创造所发展起来的。
    上党平汉战役后，他们曾在部队中进行过诉苦复仇运动，许多被解放的蒋军士兵，控诉了封建买办军阀恶霸对他们的奴役和压榨，倒出自己的苦水之后，阶级觉悟和政治觉悟提高了，衷心愿意参加人民解放军。解放区参加的士兵和干部，回忆自己翻身和解放的过程后，永远跟着共产党永远跟着毛主席走的决心更加坚决了。有一个班长以自己翻身经历觉悟过程的倾吐叙说，教育感化了班内五个新被解放的蒋军士兵，从此这个班的士气最高，新兵老兵团结也最好，呈现生气活泼，当着这一群众力量反映到纵队党委员会（纵队党的最高领导机构纵队的领导中心）时，引起了领导同志的严重注意，他们很好的研究总结了这个班的经验教训，立刻将这一经验教训普及到全纵队，用以改造新被解放的蒋军士兵和树立全体官兵的人民军队的深刻思想，这大大提高了六纵队的战斗力量和团结友爱精神。
    蒋军大举向我解放区进攻开始，六纵队即进行过爱国自卫战争的动员大会决心大会，这时纵队党委会提出打好仗，练好兵，作好群众纪律，为该纵队努力奋斗的目标。为了使这一领导思想变为群众思想，使群众自觉的努力奋斗，又提出：大家出主意，人人想办法，作战练兵群众纪律以及总结各种经验均以班排连讨论起。纵委则吸收大家意见作成结论或命令交到下面去执行，如有执行困难之处（作战命令则先坚决执行之）再征求意见再讨论再集中，再交到下面去执行，士兵群众和下级干部感到命令合理，作战练兵都有办法，事事干得起劲，领导上感觉到轻松愉快。领导者自从实行集中提高大家的意见和办法后，觉着自己的智慧和能力提高了，事事有办法，而且上下也团结了，一心一德天天求进步，不像以往天天闹“情绪”了。这一办法执行的结果，六纵队工作在各方面都活跃起来，获得很大进步。
    在作战方面，纵队学会首先提出上级所给予的作战任务，并介绍当前敌人的情况后，先不说如何打法而是首先发动从下而上的群众动员和讨论，许多指战员均能提出很多宝贵意见，特别从蒋军新被解放出来的士兵，提供了很多克服我军弱点，攻破敌人地堡、木城、鹿砦、突破敌人村落、避免敌人炮火杀伤的办法。比如他们指出我军夜间不够肃静，喊话过早，在破坏障碍时队形过分密集，以致遭受过多伤亡等等，他们了解蒋军特性和弱点最透彻，提出的对策亦最实用，这些意见迅速集中到团旅到纵队，然后又介绍到各部队并进行实地演习，和运用到作战中去。某次某连担任突击任务，因采取了这种经过新被解放士兵所指出的又经过精细研究的新的战术，和过去比较即减少二十八的伤亡，部队胜利信心和打胜仗的把握大为提高，特别是新战士大大减少了对敌所谓美械化和坚固筑城的思想恐惧而增加了斗争的勇气与力量。部队因此更加巩固，士气因此更加高涨，每个人每一部队都竞相提出自己的作战计划，普遍开展了新英雄主义竞赛，某次战斗，某团两个炊事员提出不仅要保证战斗中不让大家饿饭，而且还要缴五支枪的计划，结果他们的目的完全实现。这是六纵队政治工作的最主要的成就。
    关于训练方面，他们学会了群众性的练兵以及训练与战斗相结合的方法，战斗结束以后立即进行自下而上的作战总结，从个人到班到排到全纵队，进行自我检查并广泛吸收新被解放士兵的意见，迅速发现我之弱点及我之长处，而又研究出克服弱点发扬优点的办法，多流汗少流血成为普遍的口号。有的士兵对干部说：“你们常常说官兵一致爱护士兵、照顾士兵生活，这我们感到很好，但最大的爱护士兵，是干部的战术高指挥好，打仗少死个人”，这也推动了干部的虚心学习向上。在士兵中普遍发挥一技之长，上级则负总结责任上下一致提高技术，反对一切形式和教条，一切为了战斗的实际需要，比如他们为了适应夜间战斗排除武器故障的需要，他们蒙着眼睛练习拆卸武器，他们为了攻地堡就真作一个地堡来演习，以及进行各种的夜间战斗演习，在训练中采取边教边比划，少讲多作的办法，许多指挥员总是公式的，但是诚恳的常常这样说：“大家提的意见比我一个人讲评好得多，我还想不到这样周全。”真的结果也常常是大家提出了好多好主意好办法。由于指挥员的这种虚心向下级向群众学习的精神，就不断的提高了自己的战术素养，士兵群众的信心增高，感到这是上级看得起他们，对他们最深切的爱护。意见由此更加一致，每一个动作都得到上下一致的见解，在战场上可发挥更大的效力，这样真正作到了官教兵，兵教兵，老兵教新兵的群众路线。全军一致练兵情绪从来未有的高涨起来，冒着严冬冰雪夜以继日，发奋练习本事。
    关于群众工作，他们从新战士（翻身农民）中发现老百姓最感痛苦的是民力动员之繁重，所以他们特别重视保护与爱惜民力，建立与群众联系。自卫战争开始时，他们每旅平均需一百一十辆大车，以后经大家自动反省讨论减为十九辆大车，仅仅这一条的执行，他们与群众关系就大加改善了，他们每到一地就调查研究老百姓对军队的反映，喜欢什么，反对什么，他们就依照这些反映作成指示，命令全军执行，并定期反省和群众的关系，看有没有对不起群众的地方，有则改之，成为风气。某旅攻下某城后，群众纪律好作到秋毫无犯，得到军区的嘉奖，王克勤班在战斗中抢救群众的英勇事迹，也可为范例。
    他们在执行这一群众路线中，发现了王克勤这个积极分子及典型，王克勤是团结友爱，互助互学的模范，于是王克勤的互助运动得到迅速普遍的开展，这在提高解放区的新战士，团结和改造被解放的蒋军士兵上，起了巨大作用，十二月份该纵队一次补充新被解放的蒋军士兵二千人，一个月中只有三人逃亡即是最好的证明。反回来在这种热火朝天的群众运动中，六纵队的干部体会了群众力量的伟大和认识到只有群众是最有智慧最有办法的，因而也加速了本身的进步改造和提高，干部们更加虚心，每事总想问问士兵，问问下级看他们有什么意见，更加关心士兵，某领导同志说：“我们并无多大能力，全靠大家出主意想办法，大家来努力干”，这是衷诚的话。他们机关很精干，而且常唱“空城计”，从纵队到团营首长人员都经常在下层了解情况，总结经验，检查推动工作，发现了好经验很快发扬传播和报导，并且用很多办法去推动，不但在作战练兵等而且在其他方面，如演剧快板画报等，也都采取群众路线，做得很好，干部情绪高涨，工作都感轻松愉快，工作效率大增，干部与干部间，部队与部队间，上下级间非常团结，一有问题即自行检讨，迅速克服，他们已逐渐体会到群众力量的伟大养成一个习惯：离开了群众离开了和大家商讨研究想办法外，似乎将一无所有。
    半年来，六纵队领导者重视了群众路线，群众观点获得了各方面重大进步。这主要是由于他们学会并继续学习从群众中来到群众中去，领导与群众相结合，与实事求是的新作风。半年来经验证明，只有实行群众路线才能发挥群众的积极性与热情、智慧与创造力，才能迅速接受新的事物和好的典型，才能发现并团结积极分子战斗英雄和模范工作者，才能使部队特别干部得到改造和进步。半年来经验证明：一切的进步只能从克服戈尔洛夫的观点和教条主义中才能产生；由于普遍实行诉苦复仇的群众运动，全体官兵明确认识了人民军队的本质，大大提高其对反动统治者的仇恨和增强保卫人民斗争果实的决心。这使全体官兵在思想上完全统一团结在党的当前斗争任务下，团结在毛泽东旗帜下；由于实行不分老兵新兵的群众运动做到知己知彼，能迅速克服弱点发扬优点提高了技术，认清了敌人的弱点，使政治与技术相结合，某些盲目的恐惧和消极的表现被代之以无敌的力量和勇气；由于在实行群众路线的基础上有了健全的各级党委会，树立了集体领导制度，建立了领导骨干，发扬了民主作风，他们才能使党的正确领导路线，思想领导和新的领导方法实现，使军党、军民、官兵、上下级的团结更加密切，政治工作与军事工作协调，政治工作方向与整个军队工作方向完全一致。以上六纵队所实行的一切，就是毛主席的群众观点，群众路线领导方法在军队工作中的实际体现，是完全符合毛主席方向的。其它兵团对毛主席的群众路线领导方法和古田会议精神的执行，在工作中也有很大成绩。但我们现在还未得到较完整的材料，留待以后再加总结与提高。
    我们庆祝六纵队的发展进步并十分珍贵这一新的收获，这是人民军队建设的新方向，是政治工作上的重大改革，这是古田会议精神之恢复，这是我党整风和七次代表大会的成绩，但这还仅仅是毛主席思想在我区军队工作的开始发展极其初步的发展，我们认为还很不够，我们号召全区一切部队向着这个方向勇往迈进，继续把毛主席的思想发扬光大，加速部队的进步，继续总结和提高经验，使我人民解放军的战斗力得到普遍提高，则我们将会获得更多更大的胜利！
