　　Anyang Militia Combines Landmine and Sniper Warfare
    Creating a New Record of 53 to 0
    Bo'ai Guerrilla Team is Launching a Capture Campaign
    Ren Xiuhe Guerrilla Team Raids Jiaozuo City Area
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 18th Dispatch] Combining landmines and sniper fire, the Anyang militia has repeatedly achieved remarkable feats. On the 9th of last month, over 3,000 Chiang troops from the 40th Division of the Chiang army, in coordination with the "Returning Home Corps," invaded westward along the Shuiye-Guantai Highway. They were blocked and attacked by the joint defense militia blasting teams in places such as Xigang and Duli. As the landmines exploded, militia snipers attacked from all directions. The Xishan militia also launched three charges to fiercely attack the enemy, causing them to flee in panic. On that day, a total of 51 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and two were captured, while we suffered no casualties. This created a new record of 53 to 0 in enemy-to-ours casualty ratio in explosive warfare. Lü Bingquan, Wang Jinhuang, and other mobile blasting teams operating behind enemy lines in Anyang secretly advanced to the South Gate of Shuiye on the evening of the 26th of last month. They planted four landmines at the Five Dragon Mouth, about 100 meters from the enemy's blockhouse. By breakfast time, all of them were triggered by the enemy, killing and wounding three enemy soldiers.
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 18th Dispatch] The militia guerrilla teams active in the suburbs of Bo'ai City have universally launched a campaign to capture Chiang's puppet personnel. In the past week, they successively captured Guo Yuzhen, a Kuomintang Three People's Principles Youth League cadre, in Zhangruji, and Han Huating, the director of the puppet Bo'ai Supply Branch, and Hong Mei, a plainclothes scout of the Chiang Army's 17th Brigade, along the Jiao-Bo Highway. The Bo'ai County Command specially commended the ×× Guerrilla Team for their meritorious capture and called for the development of a county-wide capture campaign to crack down on the activities of Chiang's special agents.
    [Our Newspaper, Northern Henan Dispatch] The Ren Xiuhe Guerrilla Team, which has caused the enemy in Jiaozuo a great headache, suddenly appeared in Tianjian Village in the Jiaozuo urban area on the night of the 21st of last month. When the guerrilla team approached the guard tower of the enemy's self-defense corps, the enemy was still discussing: "The Eighth Route Army probably won't come tonight, right?", "We have thorns outside, how could they easily get in!" Ren Xiuhe and others approached the guard tower and blocked the door, shouting: "Whoever moves will be shot dead!" The enemy was stunned. Only one took the opportunity to run away, and four surrendered with their hands up. The next night, Ren Xiuhe led two squads, under the cover of the machine guns of the city brigade, to the edge of Shangbaizuo Village (north of Jiaozuo). Ren Xiuhe led the assault squad to the front of the blockhouse, carefully observing the gun holes illuminated by the lights inside the blockhouse. The whole squad rushed up and threw hand grenades one by one into the blockhouse through the gun holes. With several loud bangs, the enemy ran out without even putting on their shoes, and three were captured on the spot. An enemy soldier, carrying a short gun, lost his way in confusion and ran towards our side, where he was seized by our deputy squad leader, Wen Wenqing. In two nights of continuous attacks, a total of seven enemy soldiers were captured, and three were killed or wounded; seven indigenous rifles, spears, and broken spears were seized, as well as fifteen rounds of rifle ammunition, three hand grenades, and a blockhouse was burned down.

　　安阳民兵地雷冷枪战结合
    创五十三比零新纪录
    博爱武工队正展开捕捉运动
    任秀河武工队突袭焦作市区
    【本报长治十八日电】地雷与冷枪结合，安阳民兵屡建奇功。上月九日，安阳蒋军四十师配合“还乡团”共三千余人，沿水（冶）观（台）公路西犯，被联防民兵爆炸队堵击于西岗、都里等地，地雷一响，民兵冷枪四面袭来，西山民兵复以三次冲锋向敌猛击，敌仓惶逃遁。是日计毙伤敌五十一名，俘敌二名，我无一伤亡。创造了爆炸战中敌我伤亡五十三比零的新纪录。出没于安阳敌后的吕炳全、王金黄等飞行爆炸队，于上月二十六日晚，秘密进至水冶南关，在距敌碉堡百余米之五龙口埋雷四颗，至早饭时，全部为敌踏响，毙伤敌三名。
    【本报长治十八日电】活跃在博爱城郊的民兵武工队，普遍展开了捕捉蒋伪人员的运动。一周来先后在张茹集捕获蒋特三青团干事郭玉珍，在焦博公路上捕获伪博爱补给分会主任韩华亭及蒋军十七旅便衣探马宏美等七名。博爱县指挥部特表扬捕捉有功的××武工队，号召开展全县性的捕捉运动，以打击蒋特的活动。
    【本报豫北讯】使焦作敌人异常头痛的任秀河武工队，上月廿一日夜，突然出现于焦作市区的田涧村。当武工队摸到敌自卫团的岗楼跟前，敌人尚在谈论：“八路军今夜该不会来吧？”，“咱外边拦有圪针，他好容易进得来！”任秀何等摸到岗楼前面把门一卡，大喊一声：“谁动打死谁”！敌人呆若木鸡，仅一个乘机跑掉，四个举手就俘。第二天黑夜，任秀河带两个班在市大队机枪掩护下，到达上白作村（焦作北）边。任秀河率领突击班摸到炮楼跟前，瞅好炮楼里灯火照映的枪眼，全班人猛扑上去，将手榴弹一个一个从枪眼扔进炮楼里，轰轰几声，敌人连鞋不顾穿就往外跑，三名当场被俘。一个敌人掂着枝短枪吓迷了方向，竟向我方跑来，被我副班长温文清扭住了。两夜的连续出击，共俘敌七名，毙伤敌各三名；缴获土枪、茅枪、抉枪七枝，步枪子弹十五发，手榴弹三个，烧毁炮楼一座。
