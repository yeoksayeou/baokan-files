　　Shouting Experience
    Fenhe Detachment Summary
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th dispatch] The Fenhe Detachment summarized the experience of shouting at Shijiazhuang this time: (1) Investigate the enemy's unit number, squad and platoon leader's name and origin in advance, and find people from the same hometown as the enemy to shout. For example, ask: "Judging by your accent, you are from Zhengzhou, right?" The enemy replied: "Yes, I am from Zhengzhou." "I am from Luoyang, not far from Zhengzhou." Then mobilize him not to sell his life for Chiang Kai-shek and explain our army's policy on prisoners of war. The enemy's heart was touched and said: "Old folks, don't shoot." (2) Using "gang" language to shout is also very effective, such as shouting: "We are all one family, don't be afraid. Poor friends who have no food to eat, come over here." The enemy replied: "If I go over, will you not kill me?" This is how we started talking. (3) Send responsible cadres to shout, so that the enemy feels more secure. For example, Chief of Staff Xu shouted: "I am one of us, I guarantee your life safety." The enemy replied: "Chief of Staff, shout a little slower, there are still people in the back who haven't heard. Let me discuss it with the platoon leader." After a while, he shouted again: "Chief of Staff, you can't come in, there are landmines in front." (4) Have comrades with clear articulation take the lead in shouting, and everyone follows suit, shouting together. On the one hand, the sound is loud and travels far, and on the other hand, the enemy hears that there are many of us, which increases their terror. But there must be good hiding places. Sending newly liberated fighters to shout is sometimes more effective. For example, say: "I am from the 167th Regiment, liberated during the Yuanqu Campaign. We were all conscripted. Put down your weapons, the Eighth Route Army really treats us well." The enemy easily accepts and says: "It's okay, I know."
    According to the feedback from the prisoners, Chiang Kai-shek's foolish soldier policy and ideological rule make the Chiang army extremely poorly enlightened. When first exposing Chiang's crimes, ideological resistance occurs first. If you first start with hometown "gangs" or guarantee with feudal oaths and curses, it is easy to get close. Also, Chiang Kai-shek's deceptive propaganda, such as saying that the Eighth Route Army kills prisoners, must be specifically refuted with facts. Furthermore, most of the Chiang army were captured. Starting from their own pain, it is easy to arouse their emotions. All of these should be paid attention to.

　　喊话经验
    汾河支队总结
    【本报太岳十五日电】汾河支队总结此次史家庄喊话经验：（一）事先调查敌人的番号，班排长姓名籍贯，找出与敌同乡的人去喊话，如问：“听你的口音是郑州人，是吗？”敌人答：“是，我是郑州人”，“我是洛阳人，离郑州不远”。接着即动员他不要替蒋卖命及我军俘虏政策，敌人心被打动了说：“老乡不要打枪”。（二）用“帮会”的话来喊也很有效，如喊：“老大都是一家人，别害怕。没饭吃的穷朋友过来吧。”敌人答：“我过去你们不杀吗？”这样便接上话来了。（三）派出负责干部去喊，使敌人感到更有保证，如徐参谋长喊：“我是咱们自己人，保证你生命安全。”敌人回答：“参谋长慢点喊，后面还有人没听到，我找排长商量一下。”一会又喊：“参谋长你可不敢进来，前边是地雷。”（四）用口齿清利的同志带头去喊，大家同样一齐跟上喊，这样一方面声音大送的远，另一方面敌人听见我们人多更增加其恐怖，但必须有好的隐避地。使新的解放战士去喊，有时更易收效。如说：“我是一六七团的，垣曲战役解放过来的。咱们都是被抽出来的，放下武器吧，八路军确实是优待哩。”敌人很容易接受说：“不要紧，我知道了。”
    根据俘虏的反映，蒋介石的愚兵政策及思想统治，使蒋军觉悟极差，开始揭露蒋罪恶时则思想上首先发生对抗。如先从乡亲“帮会”拉起，或以封建的发誓赌咒等保证，则易接近。又蒋介石的欺骗宣传，如说八路军杀俘虏等，必须以事实具体揭破。再蒋军多是被抓来的，从他的切身痛处讲起，易激起他的感情。这些都应注意。
