    Minister Qian Xinzong Discusses New Improvements in Health Work
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Under the personal leadership of Comrade Qian Xinzong, Minister of Health of our military region, a new treatment method and a new surgical style are now being vigorously promoted in our region's military health work. This is a major reform and contribution to the health care work in the liberated areas serving the Patriotic Self-Defense War. In the four and a half months since the Longhai Campaign, two-thirds of the wounded on the Jiluyu battlefield have rapidly regained their health through this method. According to Minister Qian's conversation with reporters, the new treatment method has two important components: First, early debridement (cutting away the irregular necrotic parts of the wound) and early use of sulfonamides (invented during World War I and widely used in World War II), including correct and meticulous surgical procedures and disinfection work; Second, replacing the old method of changing dressings every day with scientific clinical work, and implementing fewer or no dressing changes. Doctors and nurses are not just changing dressings for the wounded every day as in the past, but are fully responsible for the wounded, closely checking their diet, sleep, and mental state at all times, as well as temperature changes, inflammation, pain, etc. They should not only pay attention to the changes in the wound and external conditions, but also pay attention to the changes in the whole body and internal conditions, and implement effective medical treatment and recuperation. In order to implement this major reform, they conducted arduous persuasion and education work for all health personnel, especially for some doctors who held conservative views and had a lackadaisical attitude. They also patiently explained to the wounded who demanded routine daily dressing changes and doubted the new method. In the Longhai Campaign, they first focused on two units to create experience, achieving a major result of only 20 out of 180 wounded needing dressing changes and only 4 developing suppuration, achieving almost 98% without suppuration, exceeding the original plan of "90% without suppuration." The leadership immediately organized various units to visit and learn from the experience, and promoted the movement to all Jiluyu hospitals. In order to implement early debridement and early use of sulfonamides (12 to 30 hours after injury), and to ensure the smooth realization of combat slogans such as 90% without suppuration, 50% of new injuries healed within one month, bone fractures healed within three months, and reduced disability, they adopted the method of good doctors taking the lead and forming small frontline mobile surgical teams to strengthen frontline technical rescue. This enabled comrades with lower technical skills to receive practical education, and the technical confidence and interest were generally improved, and the effectiveness of rescue was also generally improved. One hospital performed surgery on more than 1,000 wounded, and only 1% (a dozen people) had their legs amputated, and the rest were not disabled. They actively suggested to the logistics headquarters to stipulate the priority of rapid transfer of seriously wounded, abolished the long-distance transportation system, and quickly transferred the wounded to safer areas for medical treatment and rest, which greatly reduced the suffering and death of the wounded.
    Due to the implementation of this reform, many field hospitals have now truly become homes for the wounded soldiers. Because suppuration is reduced and nutrition is enhanced, the wounded are all rosy-cheeked and in good spirits, and the work efficiency of the hospital staff has also been greatly improved. The wounded and the staff are as close as brothers. Many wounded, as soon as their injuries are slightly better, immediately ask to return to the front line. Minister Qian concluded by saying: This is not only a technical improvement, but a revolution in the medical work of the People's Liberation Army. He urged all health personnel and health organizations to recognize their serious tasks politically and thoroughly change their old thinking and style. Our hospitals should not only heal physical wounds, but also treat the wounded with great enthusiasm, and ensure that those who are healed return to the team with full emotions.

    钱信忠部长谈：卫生工作的新改进
    【本报特讯】我区部队卫生工作，在军区卫生部长钱信忠同志亲自领导下，现正全力推行着一种新治疗法与新的外科作风，这是服务于爱国自卫战争的解放区卫生救护工作上一个重大改革与贡献。陇海战役以来四个半月内，冀鲁豫战场上已有三分之二的伤员借此迅速重获健康。据钱部长与记者谈，新治疗法有两个重要组成部分：一、是早期扩创（切去伤部不整齐的坏死部分）与早期使用＠胺剂（第一次世界大战时发明，二次大战中普遍使用），包括正确精细的外科操作与消毒工作；二、是以科学的临床工作代替过去每天换药的腐旧办法，实行少换药或不换药。医生与护士不是像过去每天给伤员换换药就完事，而要对伤员完全负责，随时细密检查其饮食睡眠及精神状况，温度变化、是否发炎、疼痛等，不仅要注意伤部与外部变化，且要注意全身与内部变化，实行有效的医治与调养。为实行这个重大改革，他们曾对全体卫生人员，特别是对抱有守旧观点与和尚撞钟态度的某些医生进行艰苦的说服教育工作。对要求照例每天换药，怀疑新办法的伤员也耐心解说。陇海战役中，他们首先抓住两个所来创造经验，取得了一百八十个伤员中只有廿人换药、四人化脓的重大成绩，做到了几乎百分之九十八不化脓，超过了“百分之九十不化脓”的原计划。领导上马上组织各所来参观，并传播经验，将运动推广到所有冀鲁豫医院。为实行早期扩创与早期使用＠胺剂（伤后十二小时至卅小时），保证百分之九十不化脓，百分之五十的新伤在一月内治好、骨折伤三个月治好、减少残废等战斗口号顺利实现，他们采取了好医生亲自出马，组成小型的火线流动手术组，加强第一线技术救护的办法，把营的甚至团、旅的卫生人员加入到连里去工作。这使技术低的同志得到了实际的教育，技术信心与兴趣普遍提高，救护的实效也普遍提高。某医院给一千多伤员施行手术，只有百分之一（十几个人）切腿，其余均未残废。他们积极向后勤指挥部建议，规定了重伤员迅速后转的优先权，废止了长途转运制度，将伤员很快转到较安全地带进行医治与休息，这大大减少了伤员痛苦与死亡。
    由于实行了这种改革，现在许多野战医院已真正成为伤兵之家。因化脓减少，营养增强，伤员都面色红润精神愉快，医院工作人员，工作效率也大提高，伤员与工作员也亲睦如弟兄。许多伤员，伤势略好即马上要求重上前线。钱部长最后说：这不仅是技术上的改进，而是人民解放军的医务工作上一次革命。他要求所有卫生人员与卫生机关都从政治上来认识自己的严重任务，彻底改变旧的思想与作风。我们的医院不仅要治愈肉体的伤，还要十分热情的体贴伤员，保证伤好者带着饱满情绪迅速归队。
