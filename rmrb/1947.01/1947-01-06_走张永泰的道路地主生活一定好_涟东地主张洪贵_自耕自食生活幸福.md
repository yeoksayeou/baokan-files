Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd: Zhang Honggui, a landlord in the Nanji District of Liandong County, after reading the Liberation Daily editorial on Zhang Yongtai's path, used his own experience of happily transitioning from a landlord to a self-sufficient farmer after the land reform to prove the correctness of Zhang Yongtai's path. He said, "The life of a self-sufficient laborer is the most blissful." Mr. Zhang originally owned 200 mu of land, and his family of eight relied on the labor of eight farmhands for a living. Although the income was considerable, life was not very good due to the large family and extravagant lifestyle. He said, "At that time, relying solely on exploiting the labor of others was the most dishonorable thing." Now he cultivates 36 mu of land, raises five pigs, co-raises one cow, hires half a laborer, and mainly relies on the labor of the whole family, living a good life. Mr. Zhang already has considerable experience in farming. He told reporters, "The key is not how much land you have, but how much manure you use. This year, I planted 25 mu of wheat and used 60 large carts of manure, which is four times more than usual. One mu will be equivalent to two mu." In addition to farming, Mr. Zhang also opened a small oil mill. He painstakingly designed and manufactured a new type of oil press, using a ×-shaped disc to press soybean cakes, which can be operated by one person. It can press 800 jin of oil per month, and the surplus is used entirely for miscellaneous expenses. He is now wearing a thick cotton robe, his face is rosy, and his body has become healthier due to labor. He concluded by saying, "After the land reform, as long as you are willing to participate in labor and follow Zhang Yongtai's path, the life of a landlord will definitely be good."

    涟东地主张洪贵
    自耕自食生活幸福
    【新华社华中二日电】涟（水）东县南集区地主张洪贵，读了解放日报社论张永泰的道路后，以他自己在土地改革后由地主转变为自耕农生活反而愉快的事实，证明张永泰道路的正确。他说：“自耕自食的劳动者生活，是最幸福的。”张氏原有二百亩田，一家八口靠八个雇农劳动过活，收入虽然不少，但因人口多排场大生活仍不怎么好，他说：“那时专靠剥削别人劳动，是最不光荣的”。现在他种三十六亩田，养五口猪，伙养一头牛，雇半个人工，主要靠全家自己劳动，生活得满好。张对种田已有相当经验，他告诉记者：“田不在多只要粪多，今年我种二十五亩小麦，上六十大车粪，比平年多四倍收成，一亩要抵二亩。”张氏除种田外，还开了一个小油坊，他自己苦心设计，制造了一种新式榨油机，用×盘榨豆饼，一人即可使用；每月能榨油八百斤，盈余全部作为杂支费用。他现在穿着厚厚的棉袍，脸色红润，身体已因劳动益臻健康。他最后说：“土地改革后只要肯参加劳动，走张永泰的道路，地主的生活是一定会好的。”
