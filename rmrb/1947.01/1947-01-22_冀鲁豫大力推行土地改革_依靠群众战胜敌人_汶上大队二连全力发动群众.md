　　Ji-Lu-Yu Vigorously Promotes Land Reform
    Relies on the Masses to Defeat the Enemy
    Wen Shang Brigade Second Company Goes All Out to Mobilize the Masses
    [Report from our Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 19th] The Second Company of the Wen Shang Brigade has achieved remarkable results in leading the masses to free themselves in the border areas. Since the Jiang army occupied Jining, Wen Shang has become a border area, and special agents have taken the opportunity to operate. It is difficult for the masses to free themselves without the cooperation of the armed forces. The Second Company of the Wen Shang Brigade accepted the glorious task of mobilizing the masses in the border area. First, the responsible comrades of the company clearly told the comrades of the Second Company that Wen Shang might be lost, and we would have to fight a guerrilla war when that happened. They also asked everyone to discuss how to fight and who to rely on. One soldier said, "If we fight a guerrilla war without the help of the people, we will be blind." Everyone said that they had to rely on the masses, but the masses here had not yet freed themselves. At this time, everyone remembered their past lives and began to complain about their suffering. Dong Guiting, a soldier in the machine gun squad, poured out his grievances and then talked about liberation. He then said, "The poor brothers in the new areas are still suffering like we used to. Special agents are causing trouble in this area, and there are few people in the Peasants' Association. We still have to lead the masses to free themselves." Some soldiers also said, "If we can organize the masses here and develop southward, our distributed land will be more secure." Mobilizing the masses became the demand of all the soldiers. Secondly, the company promptly solved the soldiers' family difficulties, wrote letters to the local district department, and conducted inspections, which satisfied the soldiers very much. Li Wenyu, a soldier in the fourth squad, said, "My family has food and clothing, which is better than when I was at home. If I don't work hard, I will be letting down the Peasants' Association and my wife." In addition, a merit book was established and reported level by level. In addition to naming and praising them, regular summaries and commendations of models were carried out, and competitions were proposed with other companies. Furthermore, the cadres took the lead. Jia Weiyan, the first platoon leader, helped the people sweep leaves and carry water, and the soldiers said, "The platoon leader is doing this, how can we not do it?" The Second Company mobilized the masses in the following way: First, they started by helping the masses with their work, and slowly became familiar with the masses. Then, they told the masses about their past suffering to enlighten them. When they learned that a certain bully was hated by everyone, they immediately encouraged the masses to fight against him, and developed Peasants' Association members and established the Peasants' Association. In the first struggle, they sent strong soldiers to participate, encouraged the masses to speak, led the masses to shout slogans, and, when necessary, raised the crimes of the landlords and bullies to guide the masses to continue to raise them, and always expressed their determination to mobilize the masses. Battalion Commander Bao once said, "When will the Peasants' Association be organized, the special agents be eliminated, the masses be liberated, and the land be obtained, then it will be over." Thanks to the efforts of all the officers and soldiers of the company, from November 16th to December 15th last year, 394 Peasants' Association members and 1,456 militia members were developed in 13 villages. Two joint struggles were carried out, and the masses obtained 13,000 catties of fruit grain, 60,000 catties of firewood, 11 head of livestock, 400 mu of land, and some furniture. Great achievements have also been made in helping the people with their work. The comrades of the Second Company have been transformed and improved in the process of mobilizing the masses. Liu Xueyun, a soldier in the eighth squad, said, "We must not look down on the Peasants' Association. It is really not easy to mobilize the masses. If we have the opportunity, we must learn from them."

　　冀鲁豫大力推行土地改革
    依靠群众战胜敌人
    汶上大队二连全力发动群众
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】汶上大队二连在边沿区领导群众翻身，成绩卓著。自蒋军侵占济宁后，汶上就成了边沿区，特务趁机活动，群众要想翻身，没有武装的配合是困难的。汶上大队二连接受了到边缘区发动群众的光荣任务。首先，该队负责同志明白告诉二连的同志们，汶上有失守的可能，我们到时就要打游击战，并让大家讨论怎样打法？依靠谁？一个战士说：“打游击战若没有老百姓帮忙，咱就成了瞎子。”大家都说要依靠群众，可是这里群众还没有翻身。这时大家即想起自己过去的生活，倒起苦水来。机枪班战士董贵亭倒了苦水，又谈到翻身，接着他说：“新地区的穷弟兄们还像咱过去一样受苦，这地方特务又在捣乱，农民联合会人少，我们还得领导群众翻身。”还有的战士说：“如果把这里群众组织起来，并能向南发展，我们分得的土地，就更保险。”发动群众成了全体战士的要求。其次，及时解决了战士的家庭困难，给当地区部写了信，又作了检查，战士都很满意。四班战士李文友说：“家里有吃有穿的，比我在家时还强，我要再不好好干，对不起农会，也对不起自己的老婆。”此外又建立了功劳簿逐级上报，除点名表扬外，定期进行总结与表扬模范，并与其他连队提出竞赛。再就从干部起了带头作用，一排长贾维言帮助老百姓扫树叶、挑水，战士就说：“排长还这样，咱还能不干。”二连发动群众的经过，是这样的：先从帮助群众干活插手，慢慢与群众混熟后，就向群众述说自己过去受的苦，启发群众。当了解某恶霸为大家所痛恨时，即鼓动群众向其斗争，并发展农会员，成立农会。在第一次进行斗争时，并派坚强的战士参加，鼓动群众发言，带领群众喊口号，必要时将地主恶霸的罪恶提出来，引导群众继续提，并随时向群众表明发动群众的决心。鲍连长曾说：“啥时候农会能组织起来，特务能肃清，群众翻了身，得了地，啥时算完。”由于全连指战员的努力，自去年十一月十六日至十二月十五日，在十三个村发展农会员三百九十四名，自卫队一千四百五十六名，进行了两次联合斗争，群众得到果实粮一万三千斤，柴六万斤，牲口十一头，土地四百亩，零星家具一部。在帮助老百姓做活方面，也得到很大的成绩。二连的同志在发动群众中得到改造与提高。八班战士刘学运说：“咱可不要看不起联合会了，发动群众真不容易，有机会咱得向人家学习。”
