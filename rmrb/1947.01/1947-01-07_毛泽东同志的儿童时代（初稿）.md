    Son of a Peasant Family

    Hunan Province, Xiangtan County, Shangqi Du, Qingji Township. Shaoshan Chong is ten li long. In this southern scenery, with green mountains and clear waters, there are some scattered houses (Note 1) inhabited by the Mao, Sun, Li, Zou, Peng, and Guo families, as well as a few families named Pang, Jiang, and Zhong. Most of them are farmers, honest, simple, and kind-hearted common people.

    Shaoshan Mountain is not very high, but the trees are lush and beautiful. It is one of the seventy-two peaks of Mount Heng. According to legend, Emperor Shun once visited here. Emperor Shun's music was called "Shaole," so the mountain Emperor Shun visited was called "Shaoshan."

    Shaoshan Chong has "Upper South Bank" and "Lower South Bank" (also called Upper and Lower "South Courtyard"). In front of the Lower South Courtyard, there is a road connecting Xiangtan and Xiangxiang county towns (where Xiangtan's Qi Du and Xiangxiang's Er Du and Si Du meet). In front of the Upper South Bank is Qiaotou Bay, a small stream passes through a stone bridge from Qiaotou Bay (here there are small shops selling oil, salt, groceries, pork...), winding around Shaoshan and the Upper and Lower South Banks, slowly flowing past. In this Upper South Bank surrounded by mountains and water, there is a simple tile house, with one main building and two wings, housing two families, one named Zou and the other named Mao. The middle of the main room is the boundary, each family living in half. In the Gregorian calendar year 1893—the 19th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the 19th day of the 11th lunar month, Comrade Mao Zedong—today's wise and great leader and mentor of the Chinese people, our Chairman Mao—was born in this house.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's father, Mao Shunsheng, was originally a poor peasant. He was tall, and in his later years he had a beard. He was physically and personally strong. He was frugal and thrifty, and good at managing household affairs. In his youth, due to excessive debt, he had to go out to be a soldier. Later, he returned to his hometown, did some small business, and through hard work and thrift, he saved some money and bought back his fifteen mu of land. At this time, the Mao family had five people: Comrade Zedong's grandfather, father, mother, himself, and younger brother Zemin. The father relied on the surplus accumulated from annual consumption to form capital, and bought another seven mu of land. The grandfather passed away, and another younger brother, Zetan, was added, still five people. Now there is even more surplus, and the family property has gradually developed. In addition, the father engaged in the business of transporting grain and pigs, so he became a rich peasant from a middle peasant. (Note 2)

    (Note 1) The general countryside in Hunan is not like the villages in other provinces, with houses connected together in a large area.

    (Note 2) According to the calculation of Hunan farm families, "one person, one mouth, seven dan and two dou," so five people need thirty-five or six dan of grain each year. Each mu of land can yield four dan of grain (each dan is one hundred jin), and fifteen mu of land can yield sixty dan. After deducting consumption, there is a surplus of twenty-four or five dan. Twenty-two mu of land can yield eighty-four dan, and after deducting consumption, there is a surplus of about fifty dan. It is said that when Shunsheng's property was large, he no longer bought land, but only gave others money for mortgages or rented it out, taking interest, so his capital increased by another two or three thousand yuan.

  Started Working at the Age of Six

    The father, Shunsheng, spent most of his time and energy doing business in transporting grain and pigs—transporting them from his hometown to large cities such as Xiangtan and Changsha to sell. The family prepared a full-time farmhand to cultivate the land. During busy farming seasons, such as transplanting rice seedlings, treading the fields, and harvesting rice in the autumn, sometimes several odd-job workers were hired. In addition, many things were left to his wife and children to do. When grinding rice was busy in winter, a short-term worker was temporarily hired, so there were seven people eating at this time. They ate very frugally, but it was always enough to be full.

    Comrade Mao Zedong began to work in the fields at the age of six. By the age of thirteen, he had to do the work of an adult in the fields during the day, and help his father keep accounts at night, because at this time, he was already the "most learned" person in the family, that is, he knew the most characters. But he only ate coarse rice and vegetables. On the first and fifteenth of each month, the family gave the hired workers some eggs and fish (rarely ate meat), but he, his mother, and his younger brothers did not have a share.

    Since he cultivated the fields from an early age and was trained by labor from an early age, Comrade Mao Zedong deeply knew the suffering and demands of the Chinese peasants. Comrade Mao Zedong himself was born of peasant origin.

  A Virtuous Mother

    Comrade Zedong's mother's surname was Wen, from Tangjia Tuo in Xiangxiang Si Du. She was of medium height, with a square face and kind eyes. She was a woman with the five virtues of gentleness, kindness, respect, frugality, and yielding. She often pitied the poor and was willing to help others. Whenever there was a famine year or drought month, she carried rice on her back, without her husband's knowledge, and gave it to the hungry people. Her virtue was famous in the countryside, and her frugality in managing the family was also famous. (Note) People said: The Mao family had Shunsheng's management outside and Wen's frugality inside, so they established considerable household affairs. In addition to raising children, she had to do everything a general rural woman did—cooking, gathering firewood, spinning cotton, sewing, and washing...

    Comrade Zedong loved his mother very much, was filial to his mother, and was always very gentle and considerate to his mother. All of his mother's virtues had the greatest and deepest influence on Comrade Zedong.

    Two such stories are circulating:

    One year, during the autumn harvest, the farmers threshed the rice and spread it out on the threshing ground to dry. Suddenly it started to rain. Everyone was busy collecting the rice. Young Mao Zedong did not collect the rice from his own family first, but first helped a tenant family to collect it. The father was angry, and Comrade Zedong said: People's family (Note) is very poor, and they still have to pay rent, so losing a little would be terrible; our own family is naturally not so important...

    One winter, Comrade Zedong left home to go to school. On the way, he met a poor young man who was only wearing a single coat in the cold and snowy weather, shivering with cold. After Comrade Zedong talked to him for a few words, he took off his own lined coat and gave it to him. When he returned home during the holiday, the family checked his clothes and found that one was missing. When they questioned Comrade Zedong, Comrade Zedong truthfully told the story.

    (Note) Some trivial matters known in the countryside, such as when the family slaughtered a pig during the New Year, the mother made pig blood soup to entertain guests. Adding some sweet potato vermicelli to it could last until the end of the first month or the beginning of the second month.

  An Honest Child

    Comrade Mao Zedong was very honest and sincere since he was a child, and he was very down-to-earth in doing things since he was a child. His father asked him and his younger brother to harvest the mud beans in the field. The younger brother was naughty and chose to pick beans where they grew sparsely. The beans were sparse, so it was easier to pick them up, and the area was also wider. Comrade Zedong, however, did not seek superficial appearance, but worked in a down-to-earth manner. He picked the place where they grew densely, honestly, picking them one by one. This took more time, but the area was relatively small. When the father came, he just glanced at it and praised the younger brother and blamed the older brother, but Comrade Zedong did not take it to heart.

    Also a neighbor surnamed Mao sold his pig to Comrade Zedong's father. The price was agreed upon, and some money was paid, but the pig was not immediately driven home. Ten days later, the price of pigs rose again, and the father asked Comrade Zedong to drive the pig back. When Comrade Zedong arrived at the neighbor's house, the neighbor said: "The price of pigs has risen; and I have fed it for more than ten days, so I am not selling it now." Comrade Zedong said: "Yes! You have fed it for more than ten days, and it is still the agreed-upon price, so of course you are not selling it." Comrade Zedong returned home empty-handed...

    People in Shaoshan Chong still tell these stories to this day, "Mr. Runzhi (Comrade Mao Zedong's courtesy name) has been very reasonable since he was a child"—they say.

    毛泽东同志的儿童时代（初稿）
    萧三
    这是作者应晋察冀边区青年联合会的《民主青年》杂志之约而写的未定稿，因为广大读者迫切而热情地盼望知道自己所热爱的领袖——毛主席的生平，特转载于此。
            —编者
    农家子
    湖南省，湘潭县上七都、青吉乡。韶山冲有十里路长。在这南国风光、山青水秀的冲里。有一些稀稀落落的房屋（注一）住着毛、孙、李、邹、彭、郭几姓人，也有少数姓庞、姓蒋与姓钟的。他们大都是务农为生，忠厚朴实善良的老百姓。
    韶山这座山并不高，但是树木菁菁很是秀丽。它是南岳山七十二峰之一。据传说舜皇帝曾经到过这里。虞舜的音乐叫“韶乐”，所以虞舜到过的山就叫“韶山”。
    韶山冲有“上南岸”和“下南岸”，（又叫上下“南院”）在下南院的前面有一条通湘潭和湘乡县城的路（湘潭七都和湘乡二都四都接界）。上南岸前面是桥头湾，一条小溪从桥头湾经过石桥，（这里有小铺子，卖油盐杂货猪肉…………）湾湾曲曲围绕着韶山和上下南岸，缓缓地流过去。在这山环水抱的上南岸，有一栋朴素的瓦房，一进两横，住着两家人，一家姓邹，一家姓毛。当屋正中为界，各住一半。公历一千八百九十三年——清光绪十九年，阴历癸己十一月十九日在这所屋子里诞生了毛泽东同志——今天中国人民英明伟大的领袖、导师，我们的毛主席。
    毛主席的父亲毛顺生公，本是一个贫农，身材高大，晚年蓄有胡子，体格和个性都很健强。他自处勤俭，为人精明，善于经管家务。少年时代因负债过多，只好出外当兵。后来回到家乡，做些小买卖等，克勤克俭，集下了一点钱，就把自己的十五亩田地买回来了。毛家这时五口人；泽东同志的祖父、父亲、母亲、他自己和弟弟泽民。父亲凭每年食用的剩余积成资本，又买了七亩田。祖父去世了，添了弟弟泽覃，还是五口人。现在剩余更多了，家产渐渐发展起来了，加之父亲作些贩运谷米和贩猪的生意，于是由中农成为了富农。（注二）
    （注一）湖南一般的乡村，不似他省村落之连楣接屋一大片。
    （注二）照湖南农家的计算，“一身一口，七担二斗”，因此五口人每年食用需要三十五六担谷子。每一亩田可收四担谷子（每担一百斤），十五亩田可收六十担，除消费外，可余二十四五担。二十二亩田能收八十四担，除食用外，可余约五十担。据说，顺生公财产多时不再买田，只给别人进押佃钱或租佃，他取利息，这样他的资本又增加了二三千元。
  六岁就开始劳动
    父亲顺生公用自己大部分的时间和精力作贩运谷米和猪的生意——由本乡运到湘潭、长沙等大城市去出卖。家里就备一个长工耕田。农忙之际，如插秧、踹田、秋收打稻，有时还雇几个零工。此外许多的事就叫自己的妻室和儿子劳动。在冬天磨米忙的时候，又临时雇一个短工，所以这时候吃饭的便是七个。吃的很节省，但总是够饱的。
    毛泽东同志在六岁的时候，便开始在田地里劳动了。到十三岁时，他白天要在田里作一个成年所作的工作，晚上还要帮父亲记账，因为这时候，他已经是全家“最有学问”的人了，即是说识字最多。但他吃的只有糙米饭和蔬菜，逢每月初一、十五，家里给雇工们吃点鸡蛋和鱼之类（很少吃肉），他和母亲及弟弟是没有份的。
    从小就耕种田地，从小就受了劳动的锻炼，毛泽东同志所以深深的知道中国农民生活的痛苦与要求。毛泽东同志自己就是农民出身。
  一位贤良的母亲
    泽东同志的母亲姓文，湘乡四都唐家坨人，中等身材，方正的面庞，和善的眼睛，是一个具备着温良恭俭让五德的女人，她常怜情穷人，肯给人帮助，每逢荒年旱月，她背着丈夫，把米施舍给饥饿的人们。她的贤良在乡下是有名，同时她的治家节俭也是有名的。（注）人们说：毛家外有顺生公之经营，内有文氏之节俭，所以建立了可观的家务。她除抚养儿童外，要做一般农妇做的一切事情——做饭、拾柴、纺棉、缝补、浆洗…………
    泽东同志非常之爱母亲，孝母亲，对母亲是一贯非常温顺，体贴入微的。母亲的一切美德，对泽东同志的影响最大，最深。
    传说着两个这样的故事：
    有一年，秋收时节，农人们把稻谷打了下来，都摊在坪里晒着。忽然天下起雨来了。大家忙着收谷子。幼年的毛泽东同志且不收自己家里的谷子，而先帮助一家作佃户的去收。父亲生气了，泽东同志说：人家家里（注）很苦，还要还租，损失一点就不得了；我们自己家里的自然不大要紧些…………
    一个冬天，泽东同志离家去学校读书。路上他遇着一个穷苦的青年，在风雪的冷天里还只穿着一件单衣，冻得打颤。泽东同志和他谈了几句话之后，就脱下了自己的一件夹衣给了他。及至假期回家，家里检查他的衣服时，发现少了一件，质问泽东同志，泽东同志照实的说了出来。
    （注）乡间知道的一些琐事，例如过年时家里杀了一口猪，母亲将猪血作汤待客。里面放些南粉条，可以吃到正月底二月初。
  一个诚实的孩子
    毛泽东同志从小就很忠厚诚实，从小作事就很踏实。他父亲叫他和他弟弟去收田里的拖泥豆。弟弟佻皮，选豆子长得稀的地方检。豆稀，捡起来容易些，面积也宽些。泽东同志却不图铺张表面，而踏踏实实地作。他捡那块长得密密的地方，老老实实，一颗一颗地摘捡。这样时间要得多，但面积却比较小。父亲来了，随便一看，竟称赞弟弟而责备哥哥，但泽东同志不以为意。
    也是姓毛的一个邻人，把自己的猪卖给了泽东同志的父亲。说好了价，也交了些钱，但是没有立即赶猪回家。过了十来天，猪价又涨了，父亲叫泽东同志把猪赶回来。泽东同志到了邻家，邻人说：“猪价涨了；我又喂了十多天，现在我是不卖了。”泽东同志说：“是呀！你又喂了十多天，还是说好了那些钱，你当然不卖了。”泽东同志空手回到家里………
    韶山冲的人们到现在还都传说着这些故事，“润芝（毛泽东同志的号）先生从小就是很讲礼性（讲理）的”——他们说。
              （未完待续）
