    【This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th】(Delayed) The "Avenge Gao Huida Campaign" of the Zhao Cheng people is now raging on. It is reported that Gao Huida, the hero who defended the country and annihilated the deputy head of the 181st regiment of the enemy, shaking the Tongpu line, unfortunately died heroically in the Humazhen battle on the morning of November 19th last year. On that day, more than 400 Chiang Kai-shek troops, under the cover of cars from the Honghe stronghold, went north in two routes. When they reached Shangjiluo and Nanwangcun, they forcibly grabbed the common people to repair roads and build bridges for them. Gao Huida, who served the people wholeheartedly, and his combat team immediately attacked the enemy in two routes. However, due to unfavorable terrain and the disparity in strength, Comrade Gao Huida gloriously sacrificed himself in the enemy's machine gun crossfire! When this unfortunate news came out, the masses and militiamen quickly wiped away their tears and said, "Crying is useless, we will resolutely fight the reactionaries to the end and avenge Gao Huida!"
