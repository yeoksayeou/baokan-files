　　Accelerating the Completion of Land Reform
    Achievements in All Liberated Areas
    [Report from this newspaper] Comprehensive reports from Xinhua News Agency: All liberated areas have achieved significant results in land reform. The Eastern Hebei region has basically completed land reform. 60.85% of the villages in the region have realized "land to the tiller," recovering more than 1.77 million mu of land. Approximately 7.7 million farmers, accounting for 80% of the total population, have been allocated land, houses, grain, and other materials, with an average of 1.5 mu of land per person. Poor and needy military dependents have been allocated more than 3 mu per person. Extreme poverty has now been eradicated, and more than 15,000 poor peasants have been elevated to the status of middle peasants (excluding Ji County and Ninghe). Most poor military dependents have become middle peasants. The enthusiasm of the emancipated farmers to join the army is extremely high, with organized groups of people enlisting collectively in platoons and companies. In Rehe Province, the land reform movement has been widely carried out since May of last year, and the movement is now entering a phase of in-depth development. A thorough inspection is currently underway. According to statistics from central and northern Rehe before September: more than one million farmers have obtained land, recovering a total of 3.74 million mu of land. One-quarter of the entire population of Luanping County has voluntarily joined farmers' associations. More than 200,000 farmers in the province have participated in self-defense forces and militias, and are actively carrying out the struggle to defend themselves, suppress bandits, and protect their land. In central Shandong's Yidu, Linqu, Anqiu, and other seven counties, 27 of the 47 border areas have completed land reform, and the remaining 20 areas are currently being vigorously promoted, with completion expected before spring plowing. As of the end of last year, land reform in the Jiaodong Liberated Area has been largely completed. According to preliminary statistics from five counties in the Donghai District alone: ​​100,000 farmers have obtained land, averaging 2 mu per person. Extreme poverty in the Binbei District has almost been eliminated. The militia has grown to more than 100,000, and farmers' association members account for 61% of the population. Women actively participate in the movement and receive land like farmers. Female servants have also been liberated and allocated land. In the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, one million poor farmers, accounting for one-third of the population, have obtained more than 3 million mu of land through land reform, averaging 3.9 mu per person, of which 410,000 farmers in the old liberated areas have obtained an average of 6 mu per person. 560,000 farmers in the new liberated areas have obtained an average of 2 mu per person. In terms of the scale and depth of the movement, Shuoxian is the best, with an average of 3.3 mu of land per person. Currently, the movement is deepening from remote villages and blank villages. In the past two months, poor farmers and families of revolutionary martyrs in remote areas of Xingxian, Linxian, Wuzhai, Pianhe, Debao, and other ten counties have obtained more than 700,000 mu of land. Linxian eliminated 73 blank villages in one month, and Baode is opening up the situation through winter school education, organizing the masses to eliminate 218 blank villages. Villages where farmers have won the victory of emancipation have a new atmosphere, composing songs and performing operas, like celebrating the New Year.
