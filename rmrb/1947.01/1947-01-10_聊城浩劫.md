    The Calamity of Liaocheng
    Tian Bing
    This was a city that once had a population of 70,000. During the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party helped the old hero General Fan Zhuxian lead 100,000 northern men to resist the southward advance of the enemy. The old hero put forward the slogan "It is our duty to defend the territory, resist with conscience, for our ancestors and parents above, and for our wives and children below." Because of this, the Kuomintang provincial government said at the time: "The east of the Taihang Mountains is half red." Also because of this, the Kuomintang government bribed General Fan's Chief of Staff, Wang Jinxiang, who used the Japanese寇's knife to kill this hero on the evening of November 15, 1938. Since then, Liaocheng was completely slaughtered by the enemy for nine years.
    I, as a reporter, entered the city on New Year's Day in 1947. No matter which gate you enter Liaocheng from, you can see white grass and artemisia more than a foot deep along the moat. Sometimes one or two crows that eat corpses would land there. No matter which street you go down in the city, you can't see a complete house, a complete door panel, or a piece of unbroken glass. Most of the door panels and houses were burned or used for making fires by the enemy. Even the houses where the puppet troops lived were burned or damaged beyond recognition when they fled.
    The homes of the common people had long been ransacked by the puppet troops. Even on the streets, there were broken clothes, quilts, cotton rags stained with blood, broken furniture, broken glass, and wounded soldiers, corpses, murder weapons, bullet casings, and banknotes from the Joint Reserve Bank abandoned by the puppet troops.
    In the northeast corner of the city, close to the north gate, is the former residence of Mr. Fu Sinian, which has become a wasteland. Standing here and looking west towards the park or north, you can see endless cemeteries. North of Wanshou Temple, with General Fan Zhuxian's pagoda as the head, is also a desolate cemetery. The dead in these graves were either buried alive, killed, or starved to death. According to the old folks, almost half of the dead in these thousands of desolate graves came from the "Guo Family Slaughterhouse" and the "Zhao Family Meat Shop." (Guo and Zhao were the titles given to two of Wang Jinxiang's most murderous executioners by the people. One was named Guo Peide, and the other was Zhao Zhenhua.)
    I visited several low houses in the northeast corner. The doors were tightly closed. Pushing open a door, I couldn't see a single living thing. Bowls and basins were still neatly arranged in the house, but the stove was overgrown with grass. Needless to say, these were all families that had been wiped out. In order to show their loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek, the traitors changed the three characters "Guangxia Lou" (光硖楼), which was inscribed by Deng Zhuangyuan in the uppermost level of the Drum Tower, to "Zhongzheng Lou" (中正楼). Standing on "Zhongzheng Lou" and looking around in all directions, all you can see is rubble and cemeteries. The north wind howls mournfully. It is truly "New ghosts grieve, old ghosts weep, the sky is gloomy and the rain is damp, and the sound is mournful." It is no wonder that Chiang Kai-shek cherishes Wang Jinxiang so much.
    Refugees who had fled to the surrounding villages or outside the city gates were already returning home at dusk. Women, looking at the graves of the dead and the broken families, wept loudly. In the fading light of dusk, how desolate the city was after the disaster! (January 1, 1947, East Gate of Liaocheng).

    聊城浩劫
    田兵
    这是一座曾有过七万人口的城市，抗战初期共产党在这儿帮助老英雄范筑先将军率领十万北方男儿，抗住南下的敌兵，老英雄提出了“守土有责，良心抗战，上为祖宗父母，下为妻子儿女”的口号，就因为这，当时国民党的省政府说：“太行山东红了半个天。”就因为这，国民党政府收买了范将军的参谋长王金祥，于一九三八年十一月十五日晚借日寇的刀害死了这位英雄，从此聊城便被敌人整整地屠杀了九年。
    记者是在一九四七年元旦进城的。你无论进聊城的那一座门，都可以看到护城河边一尺多深的白草和蒿子。有时候在那儿落一两只吃死尸的老鸦，城里无论是那一道街，看不到一座完整的房子、一块完整的门板、一块不碎的玻璃，门板和房屋大部都被敌人烧了或烤了火。就是伪军自己住的房屋，在临窜逃时也有的烧了，有的破坏的不成样子。
    老百姓家里早被伪军翻箱倒柜，就是大街上也满丢着破衣服、被子、染着血的棉花破布、打碎的家具、碎玻璃和伪军遗弃的伤兵、尸首、杀人的武器、弹壳、联合准备银行的票子……。
    城东北隅紧紧靠着北门，是傅斯年先生的家宅，已成为一片荒场，站在这儿朝西面公园或朝北看，都是无际的墓地；在万寿观北面，以范筑先将军的塔为首的，也是一片荒墓，这些墓里的死者，有的是活埋的，有的是杀死的，也有的是饿死的。这几千座荒墓里的死者，据老百姓说，几乎有一半是出在“郭家宰房”和“赵家肉房”。（郭赵是王金祥手下两个杀人最多的刽子手，一个叫郭培德，一个叫赵振华。这是人民送他们的称号。）
    我访问了东北隅几家低矮的房舍，门都是紧紧的闭着，推开门进去看不到一个活的东西，屋里碗、盆还好好地摆着，可是锅台上已经长满了草，不用说这都是死绝了的人家。汉奸们为了表示对蒋介石的忠心，把鼓楼最上层当年邓状元题的“光硖楼”三个字改写成“中正楼”。站在“中正楼”上朝四面眺望，尽是一片瓦砾，一片墓场，北风呜呜地狂号，真是“新鬼含冤旧鬼哭，天阴雨湿声啾啾”。真难怪蒋介石如此宠爱王金祥。
    逃在四乡或四关的难民，黄昏的时候已有的赶回家来，女人们看着死人的坟墓，看着破碎的家庭，大声的悲哭。暮色苍茫中，劫后的城是多么凄凉啊！（一九四七年一月一日于聊城东关）。
