"It's Better Not to Put on a Show"
     -- Conversation between Chairman Yang and Village Chief Wang
    Mao Maocun
    It started raining just twenty li after leaving the house. We struggled to climb a large mountain, and only after great difficulty did we reach the summit. Still finding no place to stay, we trekked up and down for another ten or so li before arriving at a village – Shentouling. This village belongs to Lucheng, Shanxi, and used to be an enemy stronghold, only liberated last year. Everyone's clothes were soaked, and their dirty shoes and socks were indistinguishable.
    The comrades at the village reception center brought firewood. Chairman Yang's guard lit the fire, and the feeder and several other comrades warmed themselves. The guard raised his voice to Chairman Yang and said, "Take off your clothes and change! Roast your shoes too!" Chairman Yang said, "It doesn't matter. Let's talk to the village cadres first!"
    The village chief arrived. His name was Wang Qiang, and he spoke in a loud voice, perfect for Chairman Yang to hear.
    Wang Qiang didn't know who he was talking to. Chairman Yang asked in detail about the village's situation, even asking what the villagers were eating for their three meals a day. Wang Qiang started from the enemy's rule, talked about how our army liberated Shentouling, the masses were emancipated, and continued until production and transportation, the whole village earned more than two million yuan, and bought eleven cotton gins... The more he talked, the happier he became, laughing heartily.
    Wang Qiang said, "Weizizhen and four or five surrounding villages, after being liberated, are all putting on shows with a 'ding bang ding bang' sound; the masses in this village all said: only they can sing!? We can also sing. We've been emancipated, we've made money! Can't we have some fun? The Liming Opera Troupe is passing through here on its way to the prefecture (Luanfu), and we've already booked them, the show costs 30,000 yuan. If it weren't for the rain, it would be performed today!" Chairman Yang was still smiling, staring at Wang Qiang, but a few wrinkles were gently gathering on his forehead. At this moment, he opened his mouth softly: "It's better not to put on a show. Calculate it! The show costs 30,000 yuan, plus food and drinks, it'll be another 30,000 yuan, right? If this village puts on a show, other villages will definitely come to watch, and almost every family will have to entertain guests, and entertaining guests means eating well, which is another 30,000, right? Think about it: how much more could this ten or so thousand earn if used for transportation?" Wang Qiang said: "The people insist on putting on a show when other villages sing, if they weren't emancipated, who would have this thought!?" Chairman Yang said: "Explain it to everyone, just say: we want to compete with other villages in production, compete in saving, not compete in putting on shows. When we set up our own village drama troupe, then we can sing well. Now when they put on shows, we can watch and have fun. We'll take this money for production, production, and more production, and when everyone is well-fed and clothed, then we'll be truly happy. Let everyone think about which is more worthwhile? I think: you should talk to everyone well, you have to think long-term." Wang Qiang readily agreed.
    Chairman Yang then said with a smile: "This is my personal opinion, if everyone insists on singing, then so be it. You don't recognize me, do you? My surname is Yang, tell everyone my opinion."
    At this point, Wang Qiang became unnatural. He stood up and looked at a notice on the wall from the border region government, then said with a look of surprise, "Ah! You are Chairman Yang?" Chairman Yang laughed, and everyone in the room laughed. Wang Qiang said: "This... I really didn't know, it really looks like the one hanging in the people's school, but I didn't dare to say it. Let me make some noodles for you! Don't eat this millet rice! Look at this rainy weather, you can't even get some tofu,..." He repeated this last sentence several times. Everyone told him to sit down, but he stood up again as soon as he sat down. His words stopped, Chairman Yang said: "Don't be like this, I'll eat this, I'm the same as everyone, whatever everyone eats, I'll eat. Besides, it's not allowed to use rice coupons to exchange for noodles, I should be the first to implement the system."

　　“戏还是不唱的好”
     ——杨主席和王村长的谈话
    毛茂春
    刚出门走了二十里，天就下起雨来了。我们艰难地爬着一架大山，好容易上了山顶，仍然无处可宿，又上上下下地跋涉了十多里才到了一个村子——神头岭，这个村属山西潞城管，曾经是敌人的据点，去年才解放的。大家的衣服都湿的不成样子，污的鞋袜已分不清楚了。
    村招待所的同志给拿来柴，杨主席的警卫员把火生着，饲养员和别的几个同志都烤起火来。警卫员放亮了嗓子给杨主席说：“把衣服脱下来换一换吧！把鞋也烤烤！”杨主席说：“这不要紧，还是先找村干部谈一谈吧！”
    村长来了，他的名字叫王强，他说话的声音很响亮，正适合杨主席听。
    王强并不知道和他谈话的是谁。杨主席很详细的问着村里的情形，还问到这会老乡一天三顿吃的是什么饭。王强从敌人统治说起，说到咱们的军队解放神头岭，群众翻了身，直到搞生产、运输，全村赚了大洋二百多万元，买了十一架轧花机………越谈越高兴，高兴的发出哈哈的笑声。
    王强说：“微子镇和周围四五个村子翻了身，都叮帮叮帮的唱戏；这村的群众都说：光他们能唱！？咱也唱。翻了身啦，赚了钱啦！还能不好好乐一乐？黎明剧团要从这里路过到府（潞安府），我们已和他们订好了，戏价三万块，不是下雨时今天就唱呀！”杨主席仍然是笑嘻嘻的，两眼盯着王强，但是额上却轻轻地集起了些皱纹。这时候他轻轻地开口了：“戏还是不唱的好。你算一算吧！戏价三万块，连吃带喝又得三万块吧？这村唱戏别村一定要来看，差不多就得家家待客，待客又得吃好的，这又得三万吧？你想：这十来万拿去作运输又能赚多少？”王强说：“老百姓见别村唱就非唱不行，要不是翻了身吧，谁还有这心思！？”杨主席说：“你给大家解释解释，就说：咱们要和别村竞赛生产。竞赛节约，不要竞赛唱戏。等咱们自己搞起了村剧团，再好好唱。现在他们唱戏，我们去看看就可以乐了。我们把这笔款拿去生产、生产、再生产，等大家丰衣足食的时候，那就真乐了。让大家想想看那个合算？我想：你给大家好好说一说，要从远处着想才对。”王强满口接受。
    杨主席又笑着说：“这是我个人意见，如果大家一定要唱，那也就算了。你不认识我吧？我姓杨，你把我的意见给大家说一说。”
    说到这里，王强不自然起来，他立起来看了一下墙上的一张边区政府的什么布告，然后带着一种惊奇的样子说：“啊！你是杨主席吧？”杨主席笑了，屋里的人们都笑了。王强说：“这………咱就不知道，看着实在和民校挂的那像一样，可是没敢说。我给你去做点面吧！别吃这小米闷饭啦！你看这下雨天，连些豆腐也割不上，……”他把最后这句话重复了好几遍。大家让他还是坐着，他刚坐下又站起来。他的话停止了，杨主席说：“不要这样，我吃这个就好，我和大家一样，大家吃啥我吃啥，再说，拿上米票兑面是不允许的，执行制度应该从我先执行起。”
