[This report was] transmitted by our newspaper's correspondent from Weixian on the 18th: According to a reporter's report: In ×× village near Huilong in the eighth district of Weixian, a militia was established during the peasant emancipation movement in August of last year. The captain, ××, was very active in leading the masses in the emancipation movement and was shot eight times by secret agents. However, he did not retreat or become pessimistic. After the enemy occupied Huilong at the end of November last year, the village's militia, under the leadership of the captain, bravely launched a guerrilla war. This village had been ruled by puppet-Kuomintang troops for a long time. The militia was established only four months ago. The main reasons why they were able to bravely fight the enemy this time after Huilong was occupied are as follows: First, the militiamen are truly oppressed peasants. Their political awareness has been raised in the struggle, and they recognize that only by arming themselves and defeating the Chiang army can they protect the fruits of the struggle. Second, the militia organization was earnestly reorganized. When carrying out this task, they unhesitatingly purged two puppet soldiers from the militia. They crushed the attempts of secret agents and bad elements to control and undermine the militia, maintained internal unity, and suppressed evil influences. Third, the militia has consistently served the interests of the people and has won the support and love of the villagers, establishing a flesh-and-blood relationship with the peasants. The militia's struggle against the enemy is not isolated. However, in villages near Huilong, such as Liushang Village, several "militiamen" defected to the enemy after the enemy occupied Huilong. These defectors were all puppet soldiers and local bullies. Experience has proven that the militia organization must be well-organized in order to cope with a serious environment and persist in the struggle against the enemy.

　　回隆认真整理民兵胜利坚持对敌斗争
    【本报威县十八日电】据记者报导：魏县八区回隆附近的××村，在去年八月农民翻身运动中，建立了民兵，队长××，在领导群众翻身运动中很积极，曾被特务打了八枪，但他并没有退缩悲观，去年十一月底敌人占据回隆后，全村的民兵在队长领导下，英勇打起游击战。该村曾被伪顽统治很久，建立民兵仅四个多月，此次回隆被占，他们所以能英勇对敌斗争，主要原因有以下几点：一、民兵是真正受压迫的农民，他们在斗争中，政治觉悟提高，认清了只有武装起来打垮蒋军，才能保住斗争果实。二、认真整理了民兵组织。执行这一任务时，他们毫不犹豫的把两个伪军成分从民兵中洗刷出去。把特务坏分子想掌握和破坏民兵的企图粉碎，内部团结一致，压住了邪气。三、民兵一贯都为人民利益服务，得到了全村农民的拥护与爱戴，与农民建立了血肉关系，民兵对敌斗争不孤立。但在回隆附近的村庄如留上村的民兵，在敌人占据回隆后，便有“民兵”数人投敌叛变，这些投敌者都是伪军地痞。经验证明：民兵组织必须整理好，才能应付严重的环境，坚持对敌斗争。
