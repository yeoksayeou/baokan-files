    Nine Years of Suffering Once Lifted
    Elders of the Fu Family Thank Our Party
    ——A Visit to the Hometown of Mr. Fu Sinian
    [Report from our correspondent team on the 5th] On the morning of December 21st, reporters visited the hometown of Mr. Fu Sinian, a famous Chinese historian – Daxing Village (two miles south of Liaocheng). The Fu family's ancestral tombs are located next to the village. When the reporters arrived at Daxing Village, the Fu family, young and old, immediately surrounded them. The reporters told them that Mr. Fu Sinian had visited Yan'an and met with the Communist leader Chairman Mao. Everyone was proud to hear this news. Mr. Fu Guotian said, "Mr. Fu Sinian's close relative, Mr. Fu Sixian, and his cousin, Li Rongdong, are living a happy and free life in the liberated areas. The Eighth Route Army and the democratic government take special care of our Fu family. The Fu family's residence and ancestral tombs were devastated by the traitor Wang Jinxiang." To pay respects to the historical sites of Liaocheng, Mr. Fu Ledong led the reporters to the tomb of the Number One Scholar Fu (i.e., the Fu family's ancestral tomb). However, the memorial archway on the Fu family's tomb was broken, the stone statues were tilted, the ancient cypress trees were sparse, and the scene was desolate. Mr. Fu Ledong sighed and said, "In recent years, the traitors Wang Jinxiang and Guo Chengde cut down all the cypress trees on our tomb to build bunkers and fortifications. The spirit tablet of our Fu family's ancestors was also taken into the city. Our Fu family's houses were demolished, leaving not a single one. Mr. Sinian's uncle's house was also demolished, leaving not a single tile." At this point, Mr. Fu turned from sorrow to joy and said, "The Eighth Route Army has arrived, and our Fu family has something to rely on. We all thank the Communist Party for its concern for our Fu family." (Yong Jin)

    九年痛苦一旦解除
    傅家父老感谢我党
    ——傅斯年先生故乡访问
    【本报记者团五日电】记者于十二月二十一日上午往访中国著名史学家傅斯年先生之故乡——大兴庄（聊城南二里），傅家的祖墓即在该村之旁。当记者到大兴庄时，傅家老少马上把我围住了，我告诉他们傅斯年先生曾到延安访问过共产党领袖毛主席。大家听到这个消息，都引以为光荣，傅国田先生说：“傅先生之近门弟斯献先生及其表弟李荣东，都在解放区过着民主自由的快乐生活，八路军及民主政府对俺傅家特别照顾，傅家之住宅及祖墓，为汉奸王金祥摧残得不成样子了。”为凭吊聊城古迹，傅乐东先生当领我到傅状元墓（即傅家祖墓），但见傅家墓地上牌坊破碎，石像歪斜，古柏稀疏，一片荒凉，傅乐东先生叹息着说：“几年来汉奸王金祥、郭城德，为了修碉堡筑工事，把俺墓上的柏树砍光了，俺傅家老辈的神道大牌，也拉进城里，我们傅家的房子，被拆的一间没剩，斯年叔家的房子，也被拆得片瓦无存。”傅先生谈至此，转忧为喜说：“八路军来了，我们傅家有了依靠，我们都感谢共产党对俺傅家的关心。”（勇进）
