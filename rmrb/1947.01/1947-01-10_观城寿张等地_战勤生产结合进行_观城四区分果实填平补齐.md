    Guancheng, Shou Zhang, and other places
    War Support and Production are Combined
    Guancheng's Fourth District Distributes Fruits by Leveling and Balancing
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 6th dispatch] In Guancheng, Shou Zhang, Qingfeng and other places, in the tense war situation, they are completing war support work on one hand and organizing mutual aid production on the other. In Da Liu Shu village, Guancheng First District, during the war, whenever a task arrived, the village cadres and mutual aid team leaders would first discuss it together, and then carry out ideological mobilization. After the participants in the war left, the village mutual aid team was responsible for first taking care of their work, and the village cadres would solve any difficulties at any time. The mutual aid team's production included grinding flour and making tofu, etc. Those who carried stretchers also received flour residue and slurry, so they were very enthusiastic when they went out to carry stretchers. They said, "We don't worry about our families at all when we go out." The militia and self-defense members of Hu Tai Miao in Shou Zhang Fourth District organized mutual aid teams, including war support teams, agricultural teams, and commercial teams. In three months, the commercial production team earned 5 million yuan, and the other two teams also completed the tasks of war support and agricultural production, achieving the goal of supporting the front line and production at the same time. Yang Guai village in Qingfeng is a small village of fifty households. Last spring, it had already organized four mutual aid teams, combining agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support. It has now earned 120,000 yuan. Yang Runsheng's team was praised for "actively producing during the war." Hejia in Qingfeng First District, with forty-three households, is the poorest village in the entire district, with an average of only one and a half mu of land per person. Their way to improve their lives is through mutual aid for handicraft production throughout the village. The village has a total of four mutual aid teams and two flour grinding teams, led personally by the Farmers' Association director. Two teams push carts and make tofu, and the women spin cotton every day. They are now also preparing to establish a cotton spinning team to increase production.
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 6th dispatch] The method of distributing fruits in Guancheng Fourth District during the land reform is both democratic and meets the needs of the peasants. In addition to distributing the land according to the principle of leveling and balancing, furniture, agricultural tools, trees, etc. are evaluated by the evaluation committee at a price (slightly lower than the market price), and then a membership meeting is held to announce the total number of fruits and conduct democratic evaluation, basically based on the poor and rich, plus the active and inactive, and the number of people, with the household as the unit, evaluating three grades and nine levels, and then soliciting opinions to make changes. The masses reflected: "Give us what we lack, the method is really good."

    观城寿张等地
    战勤生产结合进行
    观城四区分果实填平补齐
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】观城、寿张、清丰等地，在紧张战争情况下，一面完成战勤工作，一面组织互助生产。观城一区大柳树村，在战争中，每当任务到来时，先经过村干与互助组长共同讨论，再进行思想动员。参战人员走后村里互助组负责，先顾他的活，村干随时解决困难。互助组的生产有磨粉，做豆腐等，抬担架出发的也一样分粉渣、粉浆，所以担架出外情绪很高，他们说：“出去了一点也不挂家”。寿张四区胡台庙民兵与自卫队员组织互助组，有战勤组、农业组、商业组，三个月中，商业生产组赚洋五十万元，其他两组也完成了战勤与农业生产的任务，作到一面支援前线，一面生产。清丰杨拐村是一个五十户的小村，去春已组织起四个互助组，农业副业战勤结合进行，现已赚十二万元。杨润生组受到“战争中积极生产”的表扬。清丰一区何家四十三户，是全区中最穷的村庄，土地平均每人只一亩半，他们改善生活的办法是全村互助进行手工业生产，村里共结合四个互助组，两个磨粉组，由农会主任亲自领导。两组推小车和磨豆腐，妇女们每天纺花，现在也酝酿成立纺花组，提高生产。
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】观城四区在土地改革中分果实的办法，既民主又适合农民要求。除把土地按填平补齐的原则分配外，家具、农具、树木等由评议会评议出价目（少低于市价）再开会员大会，宣布总果实数，进行民主评议，基本上根据贫、富，附加以积极与不积极，人口的多少，以户为单位，评议出三等九级，再征求意见改动。群众反映：“缺啥给啥，办法真好。”
