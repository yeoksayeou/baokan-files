　　Hezhang Farmers All Have Land to Cultivate;
    Discussing Good Times in Winter School on New Year's Day
    [Report from Changzhi by our newspaper on the 20th] Through rent reduction in the past winter, Hezhang in She County has thoroughly realized land reform, with each farmer obtaining more than two mu of land. On the morning of New Year's Day, the masses of the entire village freely discussed their emancipation in winter school. The poverty-stricken Xie Tai said, "I worked as a blacksmith for more than thirty years and only bought four mu of poor land. My whole family was always short of food and clothing, and had no house to live in. Last year, I was allocated two mu of good land, eight rooms, as well as grain, clothing and many pieces of furniture, and I was completely emancipated." The sixty-six-year-old Chen Qirong, who was extremely poor, had no house and no land in the past and spent his whole life fleeing famine in Shanxi. Last summer, he returned home and was allocated more than two mu of good land, seven rooms, and many other things. He said loudly in the crowd, "I never thought that someone like me, who would have died with no one to bury me, would also be emancipated, with a house to live in, land to cultivate, and furniture and clothing all replenished. I will never forget Chairman Mao, even in death." Old man Wu Xiuqing, who lived by selling sesame cakes all his life, said, "In the past, when we poor people spoke in the village, the landlords always scolded us for talking nonsense; now, who can suppress us again? This is emancipation." Middle peasant Ma Baoming said, "When we struggled against the landlords last year, I thought that after struggling against the landlords, we would struggle against the middle peasants, and I was afraid every day and didn't engage in production. Later, I was allowed to join the peasant association and was given a share of the fruits, and I was relieved and worked even harder." Everyone vied to speak, and the discussion was very enthusiastic. Finally, the village cadres proposed, "The stone slab has been lifted, and if we want to get rich, we must engage in production well, and we must unite together to defend our good times." The entire crowd said in unison, "Yes! That's what we all think."

　　合漳农民人人有地种
    元旦冬学里畅谈时光
    【本报长治二十日电】涉县合漳经过去冬查减，彻底实现了土地改革，每个农民都获得了二亩以上土地。元旦上午，全村群众在冬学畅谈翻身。赤贫谢太说：“俺当了三十多年铁匠，只买了四亩薄地，全家人常是少吃没穿无房住。去年分了二亩好地，八间房，还有粮食、衣服和许多家具，一下就翻了身。”六十六岁的赤贫陈其荣，过去房无一间，地无一亩，一辈子逃荒在山西。去年夏天返家，分了二亩多好地，七间房，其他东西也分的不少。他在人群中高声的说：“真想不到像我这样死了没人埋的也翻了身，有房住，有地种，家具衣服都补齐，俺死也忘不了毛主席。”老头吴秀清，一辈靠卖烧饼过活，他说：“过去咱穷人们在村里说个话，老财们总是骂咱放屁；现在谁还能再来压制咱？这就是翻转身啦。”中农马保明说：“去年斗争地主时，我想斗了地主，就该斗中农，每天害怕，不去闹生产。后来让我参加了农会，并给我分了果实，俺才放了心，动弹的更劲大了。”大家争着发言，谈的十分热烈。最后村干部提出：“石板是揭啦，要想发财，咱们还得好好闹生产，要一致团结起来，保卫咱们的好时光。”全场群众一致高声说：“对！俺们都是这个心思。”
