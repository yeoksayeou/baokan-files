The valuable experience of the fourth district of Guancheng in combining self-defense war and land reform has been praised by the Party committees at all levels in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. With the efforts of cadres in various places to promote it, the land reform movement of farmers in Hebei-Shandong-Henan has been vigorously carried out. After training more than 10,000 activists in Yanggu, the fire was ignited in every village, and smoke rose everywhere. Farmers in ninety-five villages are now enthusiastically engaged in the struggle to turn themselves over. In a village in the sixth district of Nanwang, the victory of the struggle aroused the farmers in the entire district to complain and shout, "Let the land come home for the New Year," seizing the time to eliminate feudal exploitation. In the fourth district of Juancheng, in the midst of the war, they are also distributing the fruits of victory while fighting the enemy. The county party committee has decided to suppress traitors and spies to support the masses in order to implement land reform in the liberated areas. The second company of the Wenshang Brigade is also making every effort to help the masses in the border areas turn themselves over. The soldiers used their past suffering to arouse the masses to complain and promote the movement of turning themselves over in thirteen villages. Now, the farmers in the entire Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are settling accounts with feudal forces with the force of thunder, and the farmers who have turned themselves over are participating in the war with a hundredfold enthusiasm, and more powerfully supporting the self-defense war.

In the past six months, the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan have done their utmost to crush the offensive of the bandit Chiang, creating countless moving deeds; and our thousands of cadres, in such a tense environment, have closely contacted the masses, not avoiding difficulties and dangers, economizing on food and clothing, and working hard for the emancipation of the masses and support of the front lines. This spirit of hard struggle is worthy of great promotion and for all cadres to learn from. In the future, in order to win the victory of the self-defense war as soon as possible, and to welcome the coming bright future, we hope that the comrades in Hebei-Shandong-Henan will continue their efforts, seize the time, continue to create and promote the experience of combining war service and land reform, universally mobilize the peasants, and thoroughly complete the land reform. During the Spring Festival, we wish you all to overcome difficulties and advance victoriously!

　　再接再厉胜利前进
    观城四区创造自卫战争与土地改革结合的宝贵经验，获得冀鲁豫各级党委的赞扬，并在各地干部努力推动下，冀鲁豫农民土地改革运动，随即蓬勃开展起来。阳谷于训练万余积极分子后，村村点火，到处冒烟，九十五个村的农民，正热烈进行翻身斗争。南旺六区一个村斗争胜利，引动全区农民纷纷诉苦，高喊：“土地回家过年”，争取时间，消灭封建剥削。鄄城四区在战争中，亦正一面对敌斗争一面分配果实，县委会为贯彻光复区土地改革，决定镇压奸特，为群众撑腰。汶上大队第二连，亦全力帮助边沿区群众翻身，战士们以自己已往苦水，引起群众诉苦，推动十三个村的翻身运动。现冀鲁豫全区农民，正以雷霆万钧之力，向封建势力总清算，而翻身农民则以百倍热情自觉参战，更有力地支援自卫战争。
    半年来，冀鲁豫人民在粉碎蒋贼的进攻中，曾尽了最大力量，创造了无数可歌可泣的事迹；而我千百干部在这样紧张的环境中，密切联系群众，不避艰危，节衣缩食，为群众翻身与支援前线而努力。这种艰苦奋斗的精神，值得大大发扬，并为全体干部学习。今后为了争取自卫战争早日胜利，为了迎接行将到来的光明前途，希望冀鲁豫干部同志，再接再厉，抓紧时间，继续创造与发扬战勤与土地改革结合的经验，普遍发动农民，彻底完成土地改革，我们于新春佳节，预祝你们战胜困难，胜利前进！
