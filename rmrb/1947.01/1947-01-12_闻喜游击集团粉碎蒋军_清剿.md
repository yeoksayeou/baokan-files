　　[Taiyue Telegram from our newspaper on the 9th] The guerrilla base areas centered on Wenxi and Xiaxian have become a blind spot for the Kuomintang army in southern Shanxi. The 31st Brigade of the Kuomintang garrison army is exhausted and has completely lost its mobility. On December 9th, the brigade reinforced the Jiang (Xian) Yuan (Qu) highway. The local guerrilla group followed up and attacked. The brigade felt threatened from the rear and was forced to return to Wenxi and Xiaxian on the 14th. Immediately, it combined with more than 3,000 local bandits from Wen (Xi), Xia (Xian), Yong (Ji), Yu (Xiang) and other counties. Starting from the 22nd, they adopted the Japanese invaders' "kill all, burn all, loot all" policy and carried out cruel retaliatory encirclement and suppression of the Wenxi and Xiaxian mountainous areas. The local soldiers and civilians, tempered in battle, have smashed all three of their "encirclements and suppressions" in a week of heroic fighting. On New Year's Day, when the Eighth Route Army recovered Yicheng, the brigade hurriedly moved north to Quwo, attempting to attack Yicheng again. The guerrilla soldiers and civilians in the Wenxi area rose up again to threaten its rear. The brigade was forced to flee back to Hengshui Town in Wenxi on the 5th and remained trapped in its original defense.

　　闻喜游击集团粉碎蒋军“清剿”
    【本报太岳九日电】以闻喜、夏县为中心的游击根据地已成为晋南蒋军的盲肠，守备蒋军卅一旅疲于奔命，完全失去机动能力。该旅于十二月九日增援绛（县）垣（曲）公路，当地游击集团跟踪出击，该旅感受后背威胁，乃被迫于十四日返回闻夏，旋即结合闻（喜）、夏（县）、永（济）、虞（乡）等县杂顽共三千余人，自二十二日起采用日寇的三光政策，向闻夏山地进行残酷的报复清剿，当地百炼成钢的军民在一周的英勇战斗中，已将其三次“清剿”全部粉碎。当元旦日八路军收复翼城时，该旅急忙北调曲沃，企图再犯翼城，闻喜地区游击军民又起而威胁其背。该旅被迫于五日再窜闻喜横水镇，困守原防。
