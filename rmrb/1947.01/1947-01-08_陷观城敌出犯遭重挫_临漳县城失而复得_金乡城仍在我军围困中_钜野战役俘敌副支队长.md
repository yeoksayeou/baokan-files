[This dispatch from the JiluYu Frontline, January 4th] (Delayed) After Chiang's army occupied the empty city of Daming, its 40th Division then occupied our Linzhang City and Guancheng County in western Shandong on the 2nd. Another unit of the Chiang army that invaded Daming occupied the Zhanghe River crossings at Shakouji (northwest of Daming) and other places.

[Dispatch from the JiluYu Frontline Reporter Corps, January 6th] The Eighth Route Army on the Pinghan Front has recovered Linzhang City. On the morning of the 2nd, two battalions of Chiang's 40th Division and the puppet troops of Wang Ziquan and Guo Qing, totaling 2,000 men, occupied Linzhang City, but were immediately subjected to continuous attacks by local Eighth Route Army and militia guerrillas. The enemy, unable to gain a foothold, was forced to retreat in panic after suffering these blows, and suffered heavy losses along the way due to continuous attacks. The results of the battle are still being tallied.

[Dispatch from the JiluYu Frontline, January 6th] After Chiang's 5th Army occupied our Guancheng on the 2nd, on the 3rd, one force advanced to invade Gengwang Village (east of Guancheng), and another force moved south to occupy our Guyunji (between Guancheng and Puyang County). The enemy entrenched in Liuxiatun (on the Puyang to Puyang highway) also coordinated with the enemy in Guancheng to advance eastward, invading areas southwest of Guyunji. All the above enemy forces suffered heavy losses as they were repeatedly intercepted by our army and militia guerrillas along the way.

[Dispatch from the JiluYu Frontline Reporter Corps, January 5th] (Delayed) Since the 1st, our army has been attacking the remnant troops of Fang Xianjue's 88th Division, 21st Brigade, inside Jinxiang City. The 62nd Brigade stationed in Shanxian came to reinforce on the 3rd, advancing to Huayuji, 20 li south of Jinxiang City, but fled at the mere sight of our forces before making contact. Jinxiang City is still under siege by our army.

[Dispatch from the JiluYu Frontline Reporter Corps, January 6th] In the battle to recover Juye on New Year's Day, Fu Ziqin, the deputy detachment leader (equivalent to deputy brigade commander) of the 3rd Detachment of Zhang Lanfeng's 4th Column of Chiang's puppet troops, was also captured alive. When our army counter-attacked Juye, this traitor led a small number of personnel to jump over the city walls in an attempt to escape, but was unable to escape from our tight encirclement and was finally captured.
