　　Liu Bocheng General Among the People
    Cai Gongdi
    Because Commander Liu (the people here all affectionately call General Liu Bocheng this way) wholeheartedly serves the people and protects the fruits of the people's labor, the people's respect and love for him can be imagined from what I saw and heard in Wu'an this time:
    (1) "The Spartan Generals Can't Compare to Commander Liu"
    On the road in Wu'an, I talked with Mr. Li Xiangzhi, a middle-aged man from the local education circles. He said, "When I heard the news of Commander Liu's five great victories, it reminded me of the stories of the brave and skilled Spartan generals of ancient times:
    "Once, a messenger reported to a Spartan general, 'The enemy is very numerous, and their flags cover the sky.' The Spartan general replied, 'Then our army will fight in the shadow of the enemy's flags.' The Spartan generals can be considered brave, but compared with our General Liu Bocheng, they are inferior and backward. When the enemy used fifty brigades to attack the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, our General Liu said, 'Now our army has eliminated fifteen and a half brigades of the enemy. This is the first fifteen and a half brigades, followed by the second and third fifteen and a half brigades for us to eliminate. Now our army has only captured one Zhao Xitian. This is the first Zhao Xitian, followed by the second and third Zhao Xitians...'
    "Another time, a messenger reported to a Spartan general, 'The enemy is approaching our city.' The Spartan general immediately scolded, 'You bastard, why are you talking backwards? It is clear that our city is approaching the enemy!' This righteous indignation of the Spartan heroes can also be considered wonderful. Look at what our Commander said: 'The enemy lost fifteen and a half brigades and occupied twenty-five empty cities. If the enemy is willing to exchange this price with us, I will definitely exchange it with him.' This not only explains the meaning of the patriotic self-defense war, but also shows that genius strategy will surely defeat reactionary attacks.
    "Another time, a messenger reported to a Spartan general, 'Our city has been occupied by the enemy.' Those generals calmly said, 'When we drink soup, we inadvertently bring annoying flies in. As long as we put the soup on the table, the fly will surely fall into the hot soup.' And our Commander? He said even more precisely: 'The enemy can only die in front of me. They will be trapped to death in the empty cities by our army. Guerrillas will drag the enemy to death behind enemy lines. In the battlefield, our army creates a sea of fire to burn the enemy to death. If there are still living prisoners, then they will become dead men in reactionary politics!' These words fully demonstrate the heroic spirit of our ever-victorious general and his insightful political views."
    "Let me put it more bluntly! The Spartan generals deserve to be called unparalleled heroes, but they cannot compare with our people's hero, Commander Liu."
    (2) "Please Take Good Care of Our Commander!"
    The Xiaogaobi Women's Federation wrote a letter to Commander Liu's wife. According to Secretary Xu of the Women's Federation, they said this:
    "Dear wife of Commander Liu:
    We don't know your surname or your name, and we have never seen your picture. We women only call you 'wife' according to local customs. You won't blame us for our impetuosity, will you?!
    Although we have never met you, we know that you must be a person of good character. We are writing to you not for anything else, but to ask you to take even better care of the Commander. The Commander is your husband and also our savior. You love him, and we love him too. But our village is too far away from the Commander, and we cannot personally visit and care for him, so please take on the burden that we cannot bear. From today on, not only fulfill your responsibilities as a wife, but also entrust you to take good care of the Commander on our behalf.
    We heard that the Commander is fifty-five years old this year. If he were in our village, an old man of his age would stay at home and move around less, or not move around at all, but the Commander is still working hard on the front lines for us. A soldier who came down from the front said: 'Fighting on the front lines means not sleeping well, not eating well, and being exhausted. In this cold winter weather, there is frost, snow, and north wind and yellow dust.' The Commander not only suffers, but also has to think of ingenious ways to win battles day and night. We heard that he doesn't sleep well every night. Now that he has won five great victories, we don't know how tired the Commander is.
    So we hope that you will take care of him better than before. We hope that you will take care of the Commander thoroughly, so that the Commander has no complaints. Otherwise, we will have to raise objections to you.
    With respect,
    Xiaogaobi Women's Federation
    (3) The Drum Song Says: "Ever-Victorious General Liu Bocheng"
    I stayed overnight in Dongguan and heard the drum song. People gathered in a large circle, listening to the old black man who sang the drum song, proudly chanting: The little string hums three times... Legs are too fast to catch pigs, hearts are too anxious to listen to books, listen to me slowly tell: Not talking about past dynasties, talking about today's victorious general Liu Bocheng, everyone listen to me tell, Commander Liu has won five battles in five major campaigns. The first battle was on the Longhai Line, and Zhao Xitian, the division commander, surrendered. The Jiang army tasted the taste of the Eighth Route Army for the first time, clearly a bitter gall but insisted it was sweet soup. With their tails between their legs, they went to the front line, and Heze became the battlefield for the second time, losing seven thousand soldiers and generals, this time they greatly tasted the spicy soup. Blind people wading across the river are clearly sending themselves to death, sending themselves to death next to Juye. How about the three major victories? They beat the Jiang army so much that tens of thousands only cried out for their mothers. Everyone was happy with the three major victories, and the Party Central Committee sent telegrams of praise again and again. The old general is truly a brave general, surpassing Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang of that year. Even if a fly has no head, it will still fly around, flying to Juancheng and having bad luck, fighting for two days and two nights, and capturing Liu, the commander of the 119th Brigade. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's spies are useless, and thousands of Jiang soldiers see the King of Hell. Mice eat cauliflower and still jump around wildly before dying, jumping to Hua County and Puyang. This battle lasted one day and two nights, and Commander Liu asked the propaganda cadres to arrange the venue. At the venue, two living trophies were fighting: a brigade commander Li and a Yang. The five major victories were well fought, and the fame spread far and wide.
    "The commander fights like Wei Tong sweeping the north, the commander fights like the Yang family generals of the Song Dynasty, the commander fights like Xue Rengui conquering the east, the commander fights like Guan Yunchang of the Three Kingdoms, the commander fights like Di Qing pacifying the south, the commander fights like the loyal Yue Fei, ... the commander fights like eating sesame candy (fried dough sticks), he has his own ideas for eating it cold or hot, the great victory is still to come, wait, wait, if we win the battle tomorrow, listen to me tell you the details again, tell you the details again... ."

### 刘伯承将军在民间

　　刘伯承将军在民间
    蔡公狄
    由于刘师长（这一带人民都爱这样称呼刘伯承将军）全心全意为人民服务，保卫了人民的果实，各地人民对他的敬仰与爱戴，只要从我这次在武安的所见所闻就可以想见一般了：
    （一）“斯巴达将军比不过刘师长”
    我在武安道上，和一位本地老教育界的中年人李向志先生谈起来，他说：“当我听到刘师长五次大捷消息时，就使我想起，古代英勇善战的斯巴达将军们的故事来：
    “有一次传令兵报告斯巴达将军说：‘敌人来得真多，他们的旌旗遮蔽了天空，’斯巴达将军听了后回答：‘那么我军就在敌人旌旗荫影里进行战斗吧’，斯巴达将军们，总算得英勇吧！但与我刘伯承将军相比，他们就逊色了落后了。当敌人用五十个旅进攻晋冀鲁豫解放区，我们刘将军说：‘现在我军已消灭他十五个半旅了，这是第一个十五个半旅，接着还有第二、第三个十五个半旅的敌人，要我们来消灭。现在我军只活捉一个赵锡田，这是第一个赵锡田，接着还有第二、第三个赵锡田……。’
    “又有一次一位传令兵报告斯巴达将军说：‘敌人已经迫近我们城池了’，那斯巴达将军马上骂道：‘你这混蛋，为什么话说颠倒了，现在明明是我们城池接近了敌人！’这斯巴达英雄们的义愤，也算得精彩。看我们师长说吧：‘敌人损失了十五个半旅，侵占了我廿五座空城，如果敌人愿意用这个代价与我们换的话，我决与他交换’。这不仅说明了爱国自卫战争的意义，而且说明了天才战略必定战胜反动的进攻。
    “还有一次传令兵报告斯巴达将军说：‘我们城池已被敌人占领了’，那些将军们沉着的说：‘在我们喝汤的时候，不留意把讨厌的苍蝇带进来了，只要我们把汤放在桌上，保险那苍蝇会掉在热汤里。’我们师长呢？比他们更确切的说：‘敌人在我面前只有死，在空城里会被我军困死，游击队在敌后会把敌军拖死，在战场里我军制造了火海会把敌军烧死，如果还有活的俘虏，那么他们在反动的政治上也成了死人！’这话十足地表示出我们常胜将军的英雄气魄、和透辟的政治见解。”
    “让我说得更直截了当些吧！斯巴达将军够得上称作无比的英雄，但他们却比不过我们的人民英雄刘师长”。
    （二）“替俺们好好照料师长吧！”
    小高壁妇救会，写了一封信给刘师长的爱人，据妇救会徐秘书告我说，她们是这样说的：
    “亲爱的刘师长的媳妇子：
    咱不知道你姓啥名啥，也从来没有见过你的像片片，我们女人们，只依照乡俗来称呼你——媳妇子，你不会怪我们，使我们的性子吧？！
    我们虽然没有见过你，细一想就知道你一定是个人品不错的人。我们写信给你，不是为别的，而是要你更好好照顾师长，师长是你的丈夫，也是我们的救星。你爱护他，我们也同样爱护他。但是我村距师长不知远到那里去了，我们不能亲自去慰问与关心他，所以我们不能担的担子，请你替我们担上。从今天起，不仅尽你做妻子的责任，而且也嘱托你代表我们好好照料师长。
    听说师长今年五十五岁了，如果在我村，像他这样上了寿的老人，就在家少动弹了、或不动弹了，可是师长还为了我们在前线辛苦奔忙。曾听一个前方下来战士说：“前方打仗，睡不好，吃不好，累得人又乏又疲，在这个冬冷天，不是霜，便是雪，还有北风黄土”，师长不仅受罪，而且还要透日透夜，想妙法打胜仗，听说每晚都睡不好觉，到现在打了五次大胜仗，不知道师长疲到怎样了？
    所以希望你好好的，比过去更加关心他。我们希望你一定要把师长照顾得周周到到，使得师长没意见，如果不然的话，那我们就要向你提出意见了。
    此致敬礼
    小高壁妇救会敬上
    （三）大鼓书说的是：“常胜将军刘伯承”
    我夜住东关，听说大鼓书。人们围了一大圈，听那说大鼓的老黑子，得意的念唱：小弦子一拉哼三哼呀……腿急的不能赶猪，心急的不能听书，听我慢慢道来：不说前朝后代，说的是今朝胜利将军刘伯承，诸位听我来表，刘师长五次大战胜了五场。第一仗打在陇海线，赵锡田那个师长投了降。蒋军初尝八路味，明是苦胆硬说是甜汤。狼夹尾巴上前线，荷泽二次作了战场，损兵折将人七千，这一次大大尝到辣子汤。瞎子趟河明明送死，送死送到巨野旁。三次大捷怎么样？打得那蒋军成千成万只叫娘，三次大捷人人高兴，党中央来电表扬再表扬。老将军来真勇将，赛过了当年周瑜加上诸葛亮。苍蝇无头还要乱飞，飞到鄄城倒大霉，两天两夜打完仗，俘掳个一一九旅刘旅长。联总探子不顶事，几千蒋军见阎王，老鼠吃闹菜临死还要乱蹦，一蹦蹦到滑县与濮阳。这一仗打了一天与两晚，刘师长就叫宣传干事布置会场。会场上争着两个活的胜利品：一个旅长李来一个杨。五次大捷打得好，五湖四海威名扬。
    “师长打仗赛过维通扫了北，师长打仗赛过宋朝杨家将，师长打仗赛过薛仁贵征了东，师长打仗赛过三国关云长，师长打仗赛过狄青平了南，师长打仗赛过精忠武穆王，……师长打仗好像吃麻糖（油条），吃冷吃热有主张，大的胜利还在后，等等吧，等等吧，明天要是打胜仗，听我再来说端详，再来说端详……。”
