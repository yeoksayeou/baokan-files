    New Year's Gift
    Celebrating the Great Victories in Shandong and Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    As the new year begins, the People's Liberation Army in Shandong and Hebei-Shandong-Henan simultaneously present a great victory in the Self-Defense War as a New Year's gift to the people of the whole country. In the area northeast of Taierzhuang towards Xiangcheng, Bianzhuang, and Lanling in Shandong, our army annihilated more than three and a half brigades of Chiang's troops who attempted to invade Linyi. In Hebei-Shandong-Henan, our army successively recovered three county towns, Liaocheng, Juye, and Jiaxiang. These two good news symbolize the bright future of the Self-Defense War of the military and civilians in the liberated areas and the national people's movement for independence, peace, and democracy this year. We would like to extend our respect and greetings to the frontline soldiers, and call on the soldiers on all fronts to learn from the resolute, brave, and tenacious combat spirit and the mobile and flexible combat methods of the combat troops in the Suqian Campaign, the Southern Shandong Campaign, and the Liaocheng and Juye Campaign, to create more large-scale annihilation battles, and strive to annihilate another forty-five brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's troops to stop the enemy's offensive, transition to a counter-offensive as quickly as possible, and recover all lost territories.
    The significance of the victory of our army in Shandong is, first of all, the complete annihilation of two brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 26th Division, and the complete annihilation of the 80th Brigade of the 28th Division, causing his plan to seize Linyi to be seriously frustrated again. Secondly, it provides strong support to the Self-Defense War in northern Jiangsu, proving that the military and civilians who insist on fighting in the northern Jiangsu area are by no means isolated. Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to control southern Shandong, cut off the connection between northern Jiangsu and the Shandong liberated area, in order to annihilate our main force in northern Jiangsu, and then eliminate the northern Jiangsu liberated area painstakingly created by the Eighth Route Army during the Anti-Japanese War is bound to be crushed. Thirdly, for a long time, Chiang Kai-shek has wanted to open up the Jinpu Railway, cut off the connection between Shandong and Hebei-Shandong-Henan our army, and penetrate the land transportation line. The day before yesterday, Sun Lianzhong was still shamelessly saying: "If the government army takes action, the Jinpu Railway can be restored to traffic." The attack of Chiang's 26th Division and other troops on Linyi is precisely one of his "actions" to drive away our army on the side of the Jinpu Railway, so that his large army stationed in Xuzhou and Jinan can attack from the north and south to "restore traffic." But as a result, the Jinpu Railway was not "restored," but three and a half brigades were lost in vain.
    In the past two months, our army in Hebei-Shandong-Henan has successively recovered five occupied cities, Juancheng, Yuncheng, Puyang, Juye, and Jiaxiang, and removed Liaocheng, an important puppet army stronghold that had been wedged into the heart of western Shandong. Chiang's army paid a huge price for occupying the above five cities. For example, in the Battle of Juancheng and the Battle of Longgu, Chiang's army was annihilated brigade after brigade, which was not long ago. However, when they continue to advance, these county towns are returned to the embrace of the military and civilians of the liberated areas, which fully shows that Chiang's army has insufficient troops and cannot attend to everything; the areas he occupies cannot be consolidated, and he is unable to maintain them for a long time, and our army has begun to gain some initiative. The active attacks of our army in Hebei-Shandong-Henan threaten Chiang's army's transportation, supply, and rear security, which will increase many concerns and difficulties for the enemy who is invading Daming and attacking northward, and create a favorable opportunity for us to annihilate the enemy. Not long ago, Chen Cheng was still bragging at the reception for "National Congress" representatives, saying: "The Communist army will be defeated within one year, and the National Army will eliminate the Communist army before the next National Congress convenes in November next year (i.e., this year)." Well, let these warmongers revel in their dreams! Didn't the same Chen Cheng say "solve the problem in five months" long ago? Five months have long passed, let's see who will be defeated in a year!

### 岁首献礼  庆祝山东及冀鲁豫大捷

    岁首献礼
    庆祝山东及冀鲁豫大捷
    岁序更新，山东和冀鲁豫人民解放军同时以自卫战争的伟大胜利作为向全国人民的新年献礼。山东我军在台儿庄东北向城、卞庄、兰陵地区歼灭图犯临沂的蒋军三个半旅之多。冀鲁豫我军连续光复聊城、钜野、嘉祥等三座县城。这两个捷报，象征着今年解放区军民自卫战争和全国人民争取独立和平民主运动的光明前途，我们谨向前线健儿遥致敬意与慰问，并号召各线战士学习宿北战役、鲁南战役及聊城、钜野战役作战部队坚决勇敢顽强的作战精神和机动灵活的作战方法，创造更多的大规模歼灭战，求得再歼灭蒋介石四十五个旅，以停止敌人进攻，尽可能迅速地转入反攻，收复一切失地。
    山东我军胜利的意义，首先是全部歼灭了蒋介石嫡系二十六师的两个旅，而二十八师的八十旅又全军覆灭，使其夺取临沂的计划再度受到严重顿挫。其次，它给苏北自卫战争以有力支援，证明坚持苏北地区斗争的军民决不是孤立的。蒋介石妄图控制鲁南，切断苏北和山东解放区的联系，以便歼灭我苏北主力，进而消灭八路军抗战中艰辛缔造的苏北解放区的阴谋是一定会被粉碎的。第三，很久以来，蒋介石就想打通津浦路，切断山东和冀鲁豫我军的联系、贯穿陆上交通线，前天孙连仲还在大言不惭的说：“如政府军采取行动，则津浦路即可恢复交通”。蒋军二十六师等部之向临沂进攻，正是他企图驱逐津浦路侧我军，以便其屯集徐州和济南的大军南北夹击而“恢复交通”的“行动”之一。但其结果，津浦路没有“恢复”，反而白白送掉了三个半旅。
    两个月来，冀鲁豫我军连续收复了鄄城、郓城、濮县、钜野、嘉祥等五座被占城池，并拔除了楔入我鲁西腹心的重要伪军据点聊城。蒋军侵占上述五座城市，每一座都曾偿付巨大的代价，如鄄城之役、龙ｇù＠①之战，蒋军整旅整旅的被歼，都是不久以前的事。然而当其继续前进时，这些县城却又重归解放区军民的怀抱，这充分说明蒋军兵力不足，顾此失彼；他所侵占的地区，不但无法巩固，而且无力长期保持，而我军则已开始取得某些主动。冀鲁豫我军的主动出击，威胁蒋军的运输供应和后方安全，将增加侵占大名北犯之敌的许多顾虑和困难，并造成我歼灭敌人的有力机会。在不久前，陈诚还在“国大”代表招待会上吹牛说：“一年内击溃共军，下届国民大会明年（即今年）十一月开会前，国军将肃清共军”。好吧，让这些战争贩子在自己的梦想中陶醉吧！不是同一个陈诚早就说过“五个月解决问题么”？五个月是早已过去了，且看一年后被击溃败究竟是谁！
