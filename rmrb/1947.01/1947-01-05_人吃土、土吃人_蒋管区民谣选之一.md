　　People Eat Dirt, Dirt Eats People
    Selection of Folk Songs from the Chiang-Controlled Areas, Part 1
    (These folk songs are circulating in the Chiang-controlled areas of Hunan Province, especially around the lakeside and western Hunan.)

    Lapdog,
    Follows the official,
    Official farts;
    Open your mouth quick,
    Secret service head,
    Everywhere,
    Unreasonable,
    Quick to use force.

    Always talking about democracy,
    But I sing of dominance, not the people,
    Grain levies and taxes of all kinds,
    Rent never paid off year after year.

    The world is not peaceful,
    Stay home and go out less;
    Census checks in the middle of the night,
    Disaster falls from the sky.

    People eat dirt, dirt eats people,
    Those who grow grain are not those who eat it,
    Starving the people, no one cares.

    Heard that rice came from above,
    Husband and wife, big and small, all rejoice,
    Suffering for five months,
    No tree bark or grass roots to eat.

    General Headquarters issues one dou,
    The county government deducts three sheng,
    The district chief and town head take sixty percent,
    The Bao chief and Jia chief leave nothing.

### 人吃土、土吃人  蒋管区民谣选之一

　　人吃土、土吃人
    蒋管区民谣选之一
    （这些民谣，在蒋管区湖南省滨湖、特别是湘西一带流传着。
    哈叭狗，
    跟官走，
    官打屁；
    快张口，
    特务头，
    到处有，
    不讲理，
    好动手。
    口口声声说民主，
    我偏唱个主不民，
    拿粮上税样样全，
    年年租钱还不完。
    世界不太平，
    在家少出门；
    三更查户口，
    祸从天上临。
    人吃土，土吃人，
    种粮不是吃粮人，
    饿死百姓无人问。
    听说上边来了米，
    夫妻大小都欢喜，
    受苦受难五个月，
    树皮草根没得吃。
    总署发一斗，
    县府扣三升，
    区长镇长打六折，
    保长甲长不给剩。
