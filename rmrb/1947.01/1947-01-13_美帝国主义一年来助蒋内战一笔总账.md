Since the signing of the ceasefire order on January 10th last year, a full year has passed. Over the past year, Chiang Kai-shek has been faithless and perfidious, signing the ceasefire order only to immediately tear it up. With the active assistance of the participant in the signing of the ceasefire order – U.S. imperialism – he violated the order and launched a frenzied attack on our liberated areas, initiating a full-scale civil war, the scale of which is unprecedented in ancient and modern Chinese and foreign history. The facts are all there, and here are some key examples:

After the signing and promulgation of the ceasefire order, Chiang Kai-shek's troops never stopped attacking the liberated areas. At the same time that the ceasefire order took effect, they also occupied important cities in the liberated areas such as Fengrun, Yingkou, Jining, Hunyuan, Zuoyun, and Guangshan.

	Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region: Before January 13th, there were a total of 16 divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's troops stationed around the border region. From January 13th to the end of April, 23 divisions were successively transferred to the border region, making a total of 39 divisions. From the ceasefire order to the end of April, they launched more than 927 attacks on the entire border region. The number of碉堡碉堡碉堡 increased from the original 200 to 848, of which more than two-thirds were built after Order No. 4 of He Zijing. From the announcement of the ceasefire order to May 24th, the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek forces launched 110 attacks on the Ji-Lu-Yu liberated area, using a force of more than 640,000 people. In the narrow area of eastern Henan, they launched more than 80 attacks, using nine divisions, totaling more than 90,000 people. Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's troops launched more than 156 attacks on the Taiyue and Taihang areas, occupying more than 90 towns and villages, including Zhao Chengshou, who commanded Yan Xishan's seven divisions and the 14th Brigade of the Japanese army, totaling more than 20,000 people, attempting to attack the Shangdang area.

After June, the Chiang Kai-shek troops' attacks became even more intense, and the number of troops increased day by day. According to incomplete materials from mid-September, there were 16 armies and 41 divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in this border region, with a force of more than 378,000 people. By mid-October, they had occupied 15 of our county towns. Among them, the large-scale offensives included: From mid-May to early August, Liu Zhi commanded two armies and Zhang Lanfeng's puppet troops to attack the eastern Henan liberated area. From May 17th to September 10th, Hu Zongnan used 150,000 troops to attack southern Shanxi and the Tongpu Railway. The Chiang Kai-shek's 85th Division (Army), Sun Dianying's puppet troops, and Li Ying's security regiment in northern Henan attacked the Jiaozuo, Linxian and Anyang lines. From mid-August to September 10th, Liu Zhi and Gu Zhutong commanded 300,000 troops to attack Ji-Lu-Yu. In December, Chiang Kai-shek used six brigades to attack the Ping-Han railway line, which has not stopped until now. By December, the Chiang Kai-shek troops had used 50 brigades (original divisions) in the border region, with a force of about 400,000 to 500,000, accounting for more than 28% of the total force used in the civil war.

	Central Plains Liberated Area: From the ceasefire order to the end of April, Chiang Kai-shek's troops launched a total of 366 attacks on the area, using a force of more than 650,000 people. The Tongbai Mountain area west of the Ping-Han Railway and most of the Jianghan Military Region were occupied. After May, Chiang Kai-shek's troops were constantly attacking the area. On June 26th, Chiang Kai-shek personally tore up the ceasefire agreement in Hankou, Yingshan, Luoshan and other places, and deployed a final encirclement and annihilation plan for Li Xiannian's troops with eight armies and 300,000 people. On June 29th, after our Central Plains troops broke through to the west, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Sichuan army and Hu Zongnan's troops to intercept them. In the three days from July 19th to 21st, five encirclements were laid out for our army. By this point, the Central Plains liberated area with a population of four million had been invaded by Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

	Northeast Liberated Area: From the ceasefire in the Northeast to April of last year, the U.S. helped transport five armies, and according to incomplete statistics in mid-September of last year, it had reached eight armies, about 230,000 people. From the ceasefire order to June 7th, they continuously attacked Sipingjie in northern Manchuria and Andong Province in southern Manchuria. In these short few months, they occupied 28 of our important cities. At the same time that the 15-day truce agreement was signed on June 7th, Du Yuming said at a press conference with Chinese and foreign reporters: "The National Army expects to continue to take over major cities such as Dalian and Andong in 15 days." During the 15-day truce, they also occupied important cities such as Faku. On October 24th, Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacked Andong with three divisions. Although there were six executive groups in the Northeast, they did not make any fair mediation on the attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in various places. In Shenyang, 40 of our representatives and staff were detained. From the ceasefire order to mid-October, according to incomplete statistics, Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied 35 of our cities.

	Su-Wan Liberated Area: After the promulgation of the ceasefire order, they successively occupied our cities of Liuhe, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Haimen. After the ceasefire order took effect, within four months, they invaded dozens of important towns in central Jiangsu and northern Huai (excluding ordinary villages and towns). On May 10th, they continued to attack our western Huainan Road with a force of three divisions. From June to mid-July, Tang Enbo commanded more than 100,000 troops, along the northern bank of the Yangtze River, from Lai'an and Liuhe, through Jiangdu and Taixian, to Jingjiang and Nantong, and launched a large-scale invasion of the central Jiangsu liberated area. Chiang Kai-shek's troops along the southern Jinpu Railway in Xuzhou also launched attacks on the northern Huai area in four routes at the same time. Since July until the beginning of September, Xue Yue launched a large-scale offensive against the Su-Wan liberated area with eleven armies of about 300,000 people. From the ceasefire order to October of last year, according to incomplete statistics, Chiang Kai-shek's troops had occupied 11 cities. Until December of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek troops' offensive line in northern Jiangsu was more than 200 miles long, attempting to destroy the entire northern Jiangsu liberated area.

July 29th to August 5th, Chiang Kai-shek's and U.S. troops occupied our Anping, Yanjiao and other places. August 22nd to early September, Chiang Kai-shek's troops launched an offensive in eastern Hebei, Rehe and central Hebei with a force of seven armies, successively occupying more than ten of our county towns. September 29th to mid-October, Chiang Kai-shek disregarded everything and launched an attack on our Zhangjiakou. According to incomplete statistics, Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied 25 cities, including Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, Anci, Zhaoxian, Chongli, Huailai, Zhangbei and Chengde.

	Shandong Liberated Area: June 23rd to August 10th, Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered Wang Yaowu to lead five armies, about 120,000 troops, to attack the Jiaoji Railway. In southern Shandong, from July 29th, Feng Zhi'an commanded 50,000 Chiang Kai-shek's troops to attack the Jinpu Railway and attempted to occupy our Linyi. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Jiaodong, Qingdao and other places launched multi-pronged attacks on our Yantai in late October, attempting to encircle and annihilate the military and civilians in the Jiaodong liberated area. From January 14th to mid-October, according to incomplete statistics, Chiang Kai-shek's troops used eleven armies and thirty divisions in Shandong. Occupied eight of our county towns (not counting those that were occupied and then recovered by us).

	Jin-Sui Liberated Area: January 11th to January 14th, Fu Zuoyi and Chu Xichun commanded the 35th Army, puppet Mongolian army, puppet Jin army and other units, totaling about 100,000 people, and successively occupied our Jining, Liangcheng, Hunyuan, Zuoyun and other places. According to statistics from April 18th to the end of May alone, there were 142 attacks. From May 10th to June 28th, Yan Xishan's five divisions, the 227th Brigade of the Japanese army and two columns of puppet troops launched a large-scale offensive against the central Shanxi plain area. From September 5th to mid-October, Fu Zuoyi's troops again launched a fierce attack on the eastern Sui and northern Shanxi areas. According to incomplete statistics, since the ceasefire order until October, Yan Xishan's, Fu Zuoyi's and puppet troops occupied five of our cities. Used a force of eight armies and twenty-two divisions, totaling about 100,000 people.

	Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region: Just as Chiang Kai-shek convened the illegal National Assembly to announce the so-called ceasefire order, on November 10th, he gathered Hu Zongnan's six brigades and Ma Hongkui's troops, totaling about 100,000 people, and began to attack the border region from the northwest, east, and south of the border region. Chiang Kai-shek's planes constantly scouted and bombed Yan'an. In the month or so since the deployment of the offensive, more than 60 skirmishes have occurred.

	Dongjiang and Qiongya Liberated Areas: After the ceasefire order, the Guangdong authorities have always refused to recognize the existence of the Communist army, and sent three armies of more than 100,000 people to suppress the liberated areas. On May 15th, the Kuomintang disregarded the Guangdong agreement of April 12th and sent three regiments of troops to suppress the liberated areas. According to incomplete statistics, the Qiongya liberated area was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in two county towns, Danxian and Guangshan. Since the Dongjiang Column withdrew to the north in August and September, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have continued to carry out suppression in these two areas.

According to statistics in mid-September, Chiang Kai-shek used 75 armies and 208 divisions, totaling about 1,717,000 people, for the civil war. From the ceasefire order to mid-October, according to incomplete statistics, 109 of our cities were occupied. The occupied area was 100,620 square kilometers, with a population of more than 17,170,000 people.

Chiang Kai-shek dared to and was able to carry out such a large-scale civil war because of the active assistance and support of U.S. imperialism. The specific facts are as follows: (Materials before November)

(1) Helped Chiang Kai-shek equip 22 armies, totaling 68 divisions, 18 traffic police corps, 20 security regiments and parachute regiments, with a total of about 864,900 people. Most of them were equipped after Japan's surrender. Except for the Second Army in Kunming, the rest have been used in the civil war. After July of this year, the U.S. government planned to equip the Chiang Kai-shek army with 30 motorized divisions.

(2) Training Generals: In December 1945, the Central Naval Training Corps was established in Qingdao, with approximately 2,500 graduates. 1,000 naval personnel trained in the United States also returned to China in July of last year. The United States helped train air force personnel, reaching 2,000 people. There are American instructors in the aviation schools in Hankou and Chengdu, teaching bombing techniques. In the Sino-American joint automotive technology training class in Nanjing, transportation personnel are trained, with 8,500 students and more than 1,000 officers. There are 1,100 cars, not including those sent by Chiang Kai-shek to the United States for training. The U.S. advisory group also planned to establish three schools in October, including infantry training and artillery training, 22 military academies, and five air force training schools. In addition, the United States also helped Chiang Kai-shek establish a huge secret police force. The Sino-American Joint Secret Service Training Class, jointly run by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek, was established in Xi'an, southern Shaanxi, Ningxia, Lanzhou, Hua'an, Jianyang, Jian'ou, Kaifeng and other places, establishing a secret police and SS in the style of the German Gestapo. According to incomplete statistics, the United States trained Chiang Kai-shek in 13 departments, including the navy, army, air force, infantry, artillery, and communications... The number of trainees reached 140,000 to 150,000.

(3) Transporting Chiang Kai-shek's troops: The Chiang Kai-shek troops transported by sea and air to central China, northern China, and the Northeast included: the New Sixth Army, the Ninety-fourth Army, the Seventy-fourth Army, the Ninety-second Army, the Ninety-third Army, the Fifty-third Army, the Fifty-fourth Army, etc., totaling 14 armies, 41 divisions, and 8 traffic corps, totaling about 540,000 people.

(4) Protecting roads, building roads, and helping with defense: After the U.S. military occupied Qinhuangdao, they rushed to repair the Beining Railway and built碉堡碉堡碉堡 along the line. The Tianjin section of the Jinpu Railway from Bohai was repaired and defended by the U.S. military. Many important highways were rebuilt by the U.S. military. At the same time, they protected mines and escorted coal for Chiang Kai-shek. An airport was built in Qingdao. As for the joint defense of the U.S. military and Chiang Kai-shek's troops, it has become commonplace in Qingdao, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places.

(5) Supply of war materials: Since Japan's surrender, U.S. aid to China has reached US$4,129,712,000 (including surplus materials of US$200 million and Lend-Lease materials of US$1,335,632,000 from December 31, 1945 to June of last year). Among the aid materials to Chiang Kai-shek, there were 1,150 airplanes, 471 ships, 58 tanks, and more than 67,000 vehicles (cars, trucks, and jeeps). Other items are countless.

(6) U.S. troops stationed in China help Chiang Kai-shek's troops attack the liberated areas. A month and a half after Japan's surrender, U.S. troops illegally landed in China and were stationed in various places. There were airports in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Chengdu. According to the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State's announcement in June of last year, there were more than 90,000 U.S. troops stationed in China. Until now, not only have the U.S. troops not withdrawn, but the families of the U.S. troops stationed in China have also come to China one after another. The U.S. military has invaded the liberated areas. From October of the year before last to July of last year alone, there were as many as 30 invasions, including 19 separate invasions and 11 joint operations by the U.S., Chiang Kai-shek, and puppet troops, including the bombing of Lulong Village in eastern Hebei, spying on Yantai and Weihaiwei, occupying our Haiyang, Jinghai, and Beidaihe in eastern Hebei, and invading Anping Town. Other incidents, such as U.S. planes harassing and reconnoitering in the airspace of the liberated areas in groups of three or five, have not yet been counted.

　　美帝国主义一年来助蒋内战一笔总账
    自去年一月十日停战令签订以来，迄今整整一年了。一年来，蒋介石背信弃义，签字了停战令而又立即将它撕毁，在签订停战令之参加者——美帝国主义的积极帮助之下，违令向我解放区疯狂进攻，发动了全面内战，这个内战规模之大在古今中外历史上，是空前未有的。事实俱在，兹择要列举：

    蒋介石之所以敢于而且能够进行这样大规模的内战，是由于美帝国主义的积极帮助与支持，具体事实如左：（十一月以前材料）
    （一）帮助蒋介石装备了二十二个军计六十八个师。十八个交通警察总队，二十个保安团及伞兵团，其人数约八六四、九○○余人。其中大部分是在日本投降后装备起来的。除第二军在昆明外，其余均已用之于内战。今年七月以后，美政府又计划为蒋军装备三十个摩托化师团。
    （二）训练将军方面：一九四五年十二月在青岛成立中央海军训练团，毕业学生约二千五百人。在美国受训的海军人员一千人亦在去年七月回国了。美国帮助训练空军人员达二千人。在汉口、成都的航空学校，有美籍教官，教授轰炸技术。在南京美蒋合办的汽车技术训练班，训练运输人员，学生有八千五百人，官长一千余人。汽车一千一百辆，蒋介石派至美国受训的还不在内。美顾问团又计划在十月间，成立步兵训练与炮兵训练等三个学校，设立二十二个军校，和五个空军训练学校，此外美国还帮助蒋介石建立了庞大的秘密警察。蒋美合办的中美联合特务训练班，遍设西安、陕南、宁夏、兰州、华安、建阳、建瓯、开封等地，建立德国盖斯塔波式的秘密警察与党卫军。根据不完全的统计：美国替蒋介石训练海、陆、空、步、炮、通讯……等十三个部门。受训人数达十四万至十五万之多。
    （三）运输蒋军方面：由海、空运往华中、华北、东北之蒋军计：新六军、九十四军、七十四军、九十二军、九十三军、五十三军、五十四军等共十四个军，四十一个师，八个交通总队，共约五十四万余人。
    （四）护路、筑路、帮助守备，美军占领秦皇岛以后，抢修北宁路，沿线遍筑碉堡，津浦路渤海至天津段由美军负责修理及守备，许多重要公路由美军负责重建，同时替蒋介石保护矿山及押送煤。在青岛建筑飞机场。至于美军与蒋军共同布防等等，在青岛、北平、上海、天津等地已成常事了。
    （五）作战物资的供给：自日本投降后，美国援华物资达四、一二九、七一二、○○○美金（内包括剩余物资为二十万万美元及一九四五年十二月三十一日至去年六月租借物资一、三三五、六三二、○○○美元）。在援蒋物资中，有飞机一千一百五十架，舰船四百七十一艘，坦克五十八辆，车辆（汽、卡、吉普车）六万七千余辆。其他无算。
    （六）驻华美军帮助蒋军进攻解放区。日本投降后一个半月，美军非法的在中国登陆，分驻各地，在南京、上海、汉口、成都设有飞机场。据美国副国务卿在去年六月宣布驻华美军共有九万余人。直到现在美军不但不撤退，而驻华美军的家属都相继来华，美军向解放区进犯，仅前年十月至去年七月止达三十次之多，其中单独进犯十九次，美蒋伪配合进行的十一次，其中包括轰炸冀东卢龙村，窥视烟台、威海卫，占我冀东海阳、静海、北戴河及侵犯安平镇等事件。其他如美机三五成群在解放区上空骚扰侦察尚未统计。
