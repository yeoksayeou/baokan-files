    The Tide of Anger
    —A Record of the Beiping Students' Movement Against U.S. Military Atrocities
    Zhang Xiangshan
    While high-ranking Kuomintang officials in Beiping were busy discussing how to make the Christmas holiday comfortable and satisfying for the U.S. troops stationed in Beiping, an extremely vile act of rape by U.S. soldiers occurred on Christmas Eve. The victim was an eighteen-year-old female student, Shen ×, from the pre-university program at Peking University. She was from a distinguished family and had returned to Beiping less than a month prior.
    This atrocity ignited the anger of the entire city. The patriotic young students at Peking University were in an uproar! The next day, the walls of Yenching University, Tsinghua University, Sino-French University, and other universities were immediately covered with protest letters, news compilations, and slogans signed by dozens and hundreds of students. The cry of "Let the U.S. military get out of China!" resounded throughout the various schools. Representatives from various student organizations and departments at Peking University gathered on the evening of the 26th and established the "Preparatory Committee for Protesting U.S. Military Atrocities." They immediately decided to hold a strike and demonstration parade on the 30th to protest this bestial act and demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops. On the evening of the 29th, Yenching University and Tsinghua University also held student assemblies convened by their student unions. The students unanimously demanded a suspension of classes on the 30th to march and demonstrate in the city, and everyone present signed their names. Similarly, the students of Sino-French University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Chaoyang University, and Jiaotong University also enthusiastically made unanimous decisions to take action. The tide of protest was rising higher and higher by the minute.
    But in stark contrast, the Kuomintang authorities made every effort to defend the U.S. military's beastly behavior; and shamelessly sabotaged the students' righteous actions. That very night, the police bureau issued an order prohibiting the publication of news about the incident, and the next day, the reporter from Yaguang News Agency who had released the news was secretly arrested. The editors of two newspapers—Xinmin Bao and Shijie Ribao—that had published the news were summoned by Police Chief Tang Yongxian and severely reprimanded, who said, "The Marine Corps ordered me to be responsible for not releasing this news. Why did you publish it?" He also slandered Shen × as not being a good woman. The next day, they also released through the Central News Agency and the Shijian News Agency such unconscionable nonsense as, "Miss Shen seems to be from a respectable family," "Whether the U.S. soldier knew Miss Shen needs to be investigated," and "Shen may have flirted with the U.S. soldier in the cinema." Moreover, the mayor of Beiping, He Siyuan, shamelessly said, "The examination results show that Miss Shen's hymen was not completely broken, therefore the U.S. soldier's rape was only attempted." The most vicious thing was that after Shen was raped, the police bureau sent people to her, not only not offering any comfort to the victim, but also inflicting a brutal beating and subjecting her to all sorts of demeaning insults using despicable and vulgar means. Shen's brother-in-law, who held an important position somewhere in Beiping, was outraged and came forward to handle the matter, but the police oppression came, not allowing him to speak out. When it was rumored that he was going to host news reporters, the police bureau warned him: "If you do this, there will be bad consequences."
    Knowing that the students were going to take major action, the authorities hurriedly organized a group of secret agents to disrupt it. On the 29th, when the "Preparatory Committee for Protesting U.S. Military Atrocities" at Peking University was holding a meeting, more than 300 secret agents wearing skullcaps, smoking cigarettes, carrying pistols at their waists, and wearing Peking University badges claiming to be students from the North China College of China University came in to make trouble, shouting loudly: "The raped female student is disrupting Beiping's security and should be severely punished," "The members of the Committee to Protest U.S. Military Atrocities are national scum," etc. Secret agents within Peking University posted a wall poster called "Intelligence Network" saying: "Shen is an agent sent by Yan'an to seduce the U.S. military." This news immediately enraged all the students. They wrote on those "Intelligence Network" posters: "Is the U.S. military your father?" "Kid, do you still have a conscience? If your sister or your mother was raped by a U.S. soldier, would you also say that she was sent by Yan'an to seduce the U.S. military?" These ugly deeds also angered the professors at Peking University, who therefore became even more sympathetic to the righteous actions of all the students, and decided to voluntarily not hold classes on the 30th to support them.
    On the morning of the 30th, the police bureau's water cannons were ready, secret agents were deployed in all the schools, more sentry posts were added to the streets, and machine guns were newly installed on the walls of the U.S. military barracks, but this did not deter anyone. A contingent of 30,000 people set out mightily, and the entire city of Beiping was shaken by the cries of "Protest U.S. Military Atrocities!" and "Immediately Withdraw U.S. Troops Stationed in China!" The students sang the "Withdraw U.S. Troops" song set to the tune of "Down with the Imperialists." Thousands upon thousands of onlookers responded with enthusiastic applause. Leaflets denouncing the atrocities of the U.S. military were quickly passed into the hands of the citizens. Slogans in large characters saying "Demand the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops!" were written on the asphalt roads. The streets, buildings, trams, public buses, and even the small car of a lieutenant general from the Eleventh War Zone Headquarters were plastered with slogans.
    The marching procession arrived at the Executive Yuan's gate at two o'clock. The Kuomintang military police hurriedly closed the doors, and the students shouted outside the walls: "U.S. military get out of China!" A U.S. soldier stuck his head out of a window upstairs, and a student shouted in English: "Go home! China doesn't want you!" Then thousands of students shouted in unison. General Gillem's assistant was being kept outside the gate, and the students all pointed at him, "Please get out of China too." The plaque of the Executive Yuan was written with the slogan "We don't need the U.S. military." U.S. reporter Stillwell was busy taking pictures, and the students asked him to report truthfully.
    The procession arrived at Dongdan Square, where Miss Shen was raped, and stayed for a long time. Passing by the Kuomintang's Lizi Society, the Kuomintang officials of the Lizi Society were holding a grand banquet for the U.S. military in the Summer Palace to express their condolences. Students who knew about this immediately wrote the slogan "Please U.S. Military Get Out" on the signboard of the Lizi Society. At this time, it was suddenly discovered that several secret agents had infiltrated the ranks of China University and were shouting some reactionary slogans, which immediately angered all the students. The cries of "Down with reactionary slogans," "Down with secret agents," and "Drag out the secret agents" rose to a boil. The secret agents were frightened and ran away in a puff of smoke, and the masses followed with the roar of: "Secret agents get out!" "Oppose slavish diplomacy!"

    愤怒的浪潮
    ——记北平学生反对美军暴行运动
    张香山
    当北平国民党高级官员们正忙于商议如何使得驻平美军称心满意渡过圣诞节的时候，一幕极其丑恶的美军强奸暴行，就在圣诞节的前夕发生了。被强奸的是北大先修班的一个十八岁的女学生沈×，她是一个名门闺秀，复员到平不及一月。
    这一暴行激起了全市人民的愤怒，北大爱国的青年学生界完全沸腾了！翌日，燕京、清华、中法等各大学校的墙壁上，立刻贴满了成十成百学生签名的抗议书、消息汇录和标语。“让美军滚出中国去！”的呼声，响遍了各个学校，北大各社团各系级的代表，在廿六日晚集议，成立了“抗议美军暴行筹备会”，当即决定卅日举行罢课示威游行，抗议此种兽行，要求撤退美军。燕大、清华二十九日晚上也都由自治会召开同学大会，学生一致提出三十日停课进城游行示威的要求，在场的人都签下了自己的名字。同样的中法、辅仁、朝阳、交通同学们也都热烈的作了一致行动的决定，抗议的怒潮一分钟一分钟高涨起来了。
    但与此相反的，国民党当局对于美军此种兽行，却百般辩饰；对于学生的正义行动，无耻地加以破坏，当天晚上由警察局发出禁登此项新闻的命令，第二天发出此项新闻稿的亚光通讯社记者，遭受秘密逮捕；发出此项消息的两家报纸——新民报、世界日报编辑，被警察局长汤永咸叫去大加申斥说：“陆战队叫我负责不发这个消息，你们为什么发？”并污蔑沈×不是好女人。第二天还通过中央社和时间社发出“沈女士似是良家女子”，“美兵是否与沈女士认识须加以审查”，“沈系在影院和美兵搭讪上”等丧尽良心的滥言。而平市长何思源竟无耻的说：“沈女士经检查结果，处女膜未十分破，故美兵强奸为未遂”。最恶毒的为沈被强奸后，警察局派人前往，不单不予被辱者任何安慰，且施以毒打，以可耻的下流手段百般侮辱。沈某姐夫在北平某处任要职，怒不可遏，出面处理此事，但是警察的压迫来了，不许他声张。当风闻他要招待新闻记者时，警察局警告他：“假使这样作，将会有不好的结果”。
    当局知道了学生们要有大的行动，赶忙组织一批特务来破坏。二十九日北大“抗议美军暴行筹备会”开会时，三百多个头戴瓜皮帽、口衔香烟、腰挂手枪、胸佩北大校徽自称是中国大学华北学院学生的特务分子进来捣乱，大声叫嚣；“被强奸之女生，扰乱北平治安，应予严行惩罚”，“抗议美军暴行委员会的人是民族败类”等。北大校内特务分子贴出一张叫“情报网”的墙报说：“沈某是延安派来诱惑美军的”。这消息立即把全体同学激怒到极点，他们在那些“情报网”上批道：“美军是你爸爸吗？”“小子你还有良心吗？假使你的姐姐你的母亲被美军强奸，你也说她是延安派来诱惑美军的吗？”这些丑行也激怒了北大教授们，他们因此反而更加同情全体同学正义行动，决定三十号自动不上课支援他们。
    三十号的上午，警察局的水龙准备好了，特务满布各校，大街上增添了岗哨，美国兵营的墙上也新安置上机关枪，但这并没有吓退任何一个人，三万人的队伍，浩浩荡荡的出发了，整个北平市为“抗议美军暴行！”“立即撤退驻华美军！”的呼声所震憾，学生们高唱“打倒列强”曲子所谱的“撤退美军”歌，成千成万的围观群众，报以热烈鼓掌，控诉美军暴行的传单，迅速的传递在市民的手里，柏油路上写上斗大的“要求美军撤退！”的标语，街道建筑物上，电车上、共公汽车上，甚至十一战区司令部一个中将坐的小汽车上，都被贴满了标语。
    游行队伍二时抵达执行部门口，国民党的宪兵慌忙闭上了大门，学生们在墙外大喊：“美军滚出中国去！”一个美兵从楼上窗户伸头观看，一个学生用英语喊：“回家去中国不要你！”接着几千学生齐呼起来。吉伦将军的助手正被关在大门外，学生们齐手指着他“请你也走出中国去”。执行部门匾上写上了“我们不需美军”的标语。美记者斯缔威尔在忙着摄影，学生们要求他忠实报导。
    队伍赶到沈同学被强奸的东单广场停留很久，经过国民党励志社时，励志社的国民党官员们，正在颐和园大宴美军，以表慰籍。学生们有知道此事的，立即在励志社的招牌上写上“请美军滚蛋”的标语。这时突然发现在中国大学的行列里，混入几个特务叫喊一些反动口号，立即激怒了全体同学，“打倒反动口号”、“打倒特务”、“把特务拉出来”的呼声沸扬起来，特务们吓坏了，一溜烟的逃跑，群众随着发出：“特务滚蛋！”“反对奴才外交！”的轰鸣。
