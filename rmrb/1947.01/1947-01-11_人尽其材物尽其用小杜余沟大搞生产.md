(Our newspaper, Changzhi, 7th dispatch) In the Xiaodu Yugou area of Yushe, the masses, through the land reform and emancipation movement, have clarified the principle of "uniting for emancipation, uniting for production, and moving towards prosperity." This winter's production is particularly active. The entire village has implemented the correct policy of "primarily organizing labor, comprehensively organizing everyone, making the best use of people's talents, and making the best use of resources." In the past month, they have earned 2.64 million yuan. Cooperative hero Qiao Runsheng is an expert in carding wool. He organized a wool carding factory and personally researched and modified fifteen slingshots, launching a wool spinning campaign. The entire village's livestock was pooled to transport goods to Licheng, and along the way, they planned to establish a transportation team. They also opened a mill, did cotton fluffing, made tofu, and raised pigs, organizing twenty head of livestock. Ninety-four percent of the village's labor force was organized, and various technical talents also participated in the organization. The wool weaving factory, mutual aid society, and Jumin cooperative became the core of organizing comprehensive winter production. The entire village's production achieved unified planning and separate activities, adopting a unified voluntary labor system, stipulating that one li is one point, ten li is a small work unit, and sixty li is a large work unit. Those assigned tasks receive work tickets based on the distance traveled, and a unified system of swapping labor is used for both assigned tasks and production, resolving the contradiction between assigned tasks and production.
