Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th. According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 26th of last month: the machine industry, which occupies an important position in Chongqing's industry, has now declined from a total of 928 during the Anti-Japanese War to 182 (approximately eight out of ten). Among these 182, 50% are in a crisis of "temporary shutdown pending resumption of business", and 30% are about to close down. The remaining majority of small iron factories barely manage to survive by making iron nails and daily necessities. Among the six larger iron factories, with the exception of the state-run D渡口 Iron and Steel Plant, Ziy Yu, and the 24th Arsenal, which are working day and night to manufacture weapons for the civil war, even the "private" China Industrial Company, China Steel Plant, and Yu鑫 Iron and Steel Plant, in which bureaucratic capital either participates or is involved, cannot escape the fate of suspending work and reducing production. In order to save their endangered lives, the Chongqing Machine and Steel Industry Association passed a resolution on the 11th of last month, requesting the Ministry of Transportation to allow Chinese-owned factories to undertake the manufacture of some of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway's equipment, so as not to rely entirely on foreign countries.

    重庆机器工厂
    十分之八倒闭
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据上月二十六日沪大公报载称：占重庆工业重要地位的机器工业，目前已由抗战时计共九二八家倒闭至一八二家（约十分之八）就在这一八二家中，还有百分之五十处于“暂行停工待机复业”的危机中，有百分之三十将关门。仅存的大部分小型铁工厂，以打铁钉、制日常用具勉强维持。在六家规模较大的铁工厂中，除官营的大渡口钢铁厂、资渝、二十四兵工厂在日夜加工的制造内战杀人武器外，甚至有官僚资本或参与的“民营”的中国兴业公司、中国制钢厂、渝鑫钢铁厂，也一样逃脱不了停工减产的命运。为了挽救垂危的生命，上月十一日重庆机器钢铁业公会通过决议，再请交通部准许中国人办的工厂承制一部分成渝铁路的器材，不要完全仰给外国。
