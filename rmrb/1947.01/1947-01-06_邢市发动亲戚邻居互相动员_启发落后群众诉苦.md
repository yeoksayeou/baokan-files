Xingtai City mobilizes relatives and neighbors to encourage each other, inspiring the broad masses who had fallen behind to participate in the thorough struggle to destroy feudalism by speaking out about their sufferings and settling accounts. After a year of mass movement, the city had achieved great success, but the feudal forces had not been completely defeated, and a large number of backward masses had not participated in the movement. Some cadres had complained that the masses were backward, but recently, after discussions at district meetings, everyone unanimously recognized that it was wrong to simply complain about the backwardness of the masses. They should understand that it was because the cadres' work had not been done well, that "the more backward they are, the deeper the poisoning and the more suffering they have." "Backward masses are the walls of the feudal forces; if we do not eliminate the backward elements, we cannot defeat feudalism." They also concluded: "Explain more to the backward, speak to their pain, and if their minds are opened, they will dare to struggle." It was decided to mobilize members to go and mobilize people separately, creating a mass movement to eliminate the backward elements. The masses in Xin Street voluntarily proposed a guarantee: first mobilize their own families to participate in the struggle, then mobilize those living in the same courtyard and their neighbors, with each person mobilizing at least one person. Shi Chenglin explained that this method has three advantages: First, the more people there are, the more people will be mobilized. Second, everyone finds their confidants, speaks intimately, and it is easier to find the root of the problem and hit the pain points. Third, family members and neighbors live close by and talk a lot, so the target can be transformed quickly. Old lady Yu Guo of Xuedao Street forgot to eat her meal in order to mobilize people to visit and speak of their sufferings. Little Zhu's mother mobilized her neighbor Jingni, saying, "Sister-in-law Jingni, during the lean years, we went to the fields to pick up cabbage leaves and were beaten by people with big rakes! Have you forgotten?" Sister-in-law Jing interrupted, saying, "That year we ate coarse bran, and there was blood in our stool. We suffered because we had no money!" Yu Guo said, "Why didn't we have money? We had to pay ninety yuan a day for small labor service, but households like Su Zhuxin didn't have to pay. Don't you think they impoverished us? People have been speaking out about their sufferings and settling accounts with him these past few days. Why don't you go and speak out too?" In this way, Jingni participated in the struggle to speak out about her sufferings. Zhang Yang, who was in her forties, mobilized Feng Wu's mother, saying, "I'm not as old as you, but I've suffered a lot. My husband's family was poor. The first day after I gave birth, I drank soup made with boiled turnips, and on the third day, I took my child out to beg for food... it was all because the traitors and local bullies exploited us." Finally, Feng Wu's mother said, "You can pour out your bitterness, and I won't let mine rot in my stomach," and she began to speak out. As a result of the mass mobilization, everyone on the streets and in every household was talking about their sufferings. This was more universal and widespread than ever before. In Ma City Street, one hundred and ten people who had never spoken out about their sufferings participated in the struggle in one day. In Xuedao Street, the masses who had been silent were all involved in the movement within three days. In West Street, more than a hundred households poured into the Civilian Association within four days. The number of Civilian Association members in Xin Street surged to one hundred and eight, a two-fold increase. In Village Front West Street, the personnel of the puppet army and their families, who accounted for the majority of the residents, also gained the understanding of the masses, washed their faces, rubbed them with dirt, and participated in the movement. At present, the mass movement to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of feudalism in the city is advancing towards its climax by leaps and bounds.

    邢市发动亲戚邻居互相动员
    启发落后群众诉苦
    【本报讯】邢台市群众在亲戚邻居，互相动员启发，广大落后群众纷纷卷入彻底摧毁封建的诉苦清算斗争。该市经过一年群运，曾取得很大成绩，但封建势力尚未彻底打垮，大批落后群众未参加运动，某些干部曾埋怨群众落后，但近日经各区大会讨论，大家一致认识到光埋怨群众落后是不对的，应该明白是咱干部们工作没作到，“愈是落后的多，毒害愈深，痛苦愈多。”“落后群众是封建势力的围墙，不消灭落后层就打不垮封建。”并且得出结论：“落后给他多解释，说到痛处、打通思想就敢斗争。”并决定发动会员去分头动员，造成群众性消灭落后层的运动。新街群众自动提出保证：首先动员自己家里人都参加斗争，再动员同院住的和邻居，每人至少动员一个人。石成林并说明这个办法有三个好处：一、人多了动员来的人也愈多。二、各找各的知心人，说知心话，容易找到病根，打到痛处。三、本家、邻居住得近、谈得多，对象就能转变快。学道街老太太于郭氏为动员访苦，饭也忘了吃。小柱妈动员邻居景妮说：“景妮嫂，过赖年景咱到地里拾白菜帮子，还叫人家用大拉打咱，便记不得了！？”景嫂抢着说：“那年吃的粗糠，大便就一片血，咱没钱才受这罪！”于郭氏说：“为啥没钱？一天出九十元小夫钱，像苏柱馨那样的户都不出夫，你说不是被他们整治穷了？人家这两天都在对他诉苦、算账、你为啥不去诉诉？”就这样景妮参加了诉苦斗争。四十多岁的张杨氏动员逢武娘说：“我没你岁数大，罪可受得不少，婆家穷，生了孩子第一天是蔓菁烧开水，第三天就带着孩子出去要饭……都是汉奸恶霸剥削了咱。”最后逢武娘说：“你的苦水能往出倒，我的苦也不叫烂到肚里，”就诉起来了。群众性动员的结果，街谈巷议，家家户户都是诉苦声，比过去任何一次都普遍，广泛，马市街一天即有百一十个从未诉苦的人参加诉苦。学道街不吭气群众在三天内全部卷入运动，西大街四天内有百多户涌入平民会，新街平民会员发展至一百零八人，激增两倍。村前西街，占居民大半的伪军人员及伪属，亦取得了群众谅解，纷纷洗脸擦黑，参加运动。现该市彻底扫清封建残余的群众运动正大踏步迈向高潮。
