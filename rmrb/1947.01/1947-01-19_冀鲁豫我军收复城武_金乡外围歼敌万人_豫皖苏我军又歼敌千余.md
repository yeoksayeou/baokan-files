　　Jilu Yu Our Army Recovers Chengwu
    Annihilating 10,000 Enemies Outside Jinxiang
    Yuwan Su Our Army Annihilates Over 1,000 More Enemies

    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front, January 17th] Following the encirclement and annihilation of over 9,000 Chiang troops near Yutai, General Liu Bocheng's forces besieging Jinxiang City achieved another major victory. In the five days from the 12th to the 16th, they annihilated five regiments (less one battalion) from the Mi Wenhe, Liu Ruzhen, and Zhang Lanfeng units coming to reinforce from Heze and Dingtao, totaling 10,000 men. On the evening of the 16th, they seized the opportunity to recover Chengwu County. The remaining vital forces of the Chiang-puppet army in the southwestern Shandong area have now been basically eliminated. Fang Xianjue's remnants are still besieged in Jinxiang and Yutai. The remaining few garrison Chiang-puppet troops in Heze, Dingtao, Cao County, Shan County, and other places are now completely exposed to our army's direct strikes.

    After one and a half brigades of Chiang's army reinforcing Jinxiang were annihilated on the 9th, under Gu Zhutong's strict orders and urging, Mi Wenhe and Liu Ruzhen personally led two regiments (less one battalion) of the 55th Division and one regiment of the 68th Division from Heze, while the puppet Zhang Lanfeng personally led two regiments of the 4th Column from Dingtao, simultaneously heading east to reinforce Jinxiang. From the 12th to the 14th, over 3,000 men of Zhang's bandit unit were completely annihilated, and Zhang Lanfeng fled in panic. On the evening of the 16th, the Eighth Route Army took advantage of the victory to enter Chengwu County, and after two hours of fierce fighting, completely eliminated the puppet Zhang Lanfeng's logistics battalion, the puppet Zhi Yongde's security regiment, the Chiang-appointed Chengwu County government, and five puppet district offices, and the city was liberated. After Mi Wenhe's and Liu Ruzhen's units scurried to the Luji area south of Chengwu, they suffered severe blows on the 12th and 13th and fled westward. They were surrounded at Xitaizi east of Dingtao, and two battalions were annihilated on the 15th. The remaining two regiments, under the cover of five or six Chiang aircraft, attempted to break through to the west on the afternoon of the 16th, but were finally completely annihilated at Xitaizi. It is estimated that over 1,000 were killed or wounded, over 5,000 were captured alive, and Mi Wenhe and Liu Ruzhen barely escaped with their lives. In total, the enemy from the two reinforcing routes, in addition to over 1,000 killed or wounded, had over 9,000 captured alive. A large number of spoils were seized and are currently being inventoried.

    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front, January 17th] While our army north of the Longhai Railway was reporting frequent victories, our Yuwan Su army, active south of the railway, also annihilated over 1,000 enemies near Xuefeng (Yongcheng). The entire 30th Regiment and one battalion of the 29th Regiment (a total of four battalions) of the New 10th Brigade of the Chiang army's 58th Division, stationed west of Xuefeng, advanced on Longxingji east of Xuefeng City on the 13th. Our army rose up to meet them in battle, and by dusk on the 14th, most of the Chiang army was annihilated except for a few who fled. It is estimated that over 100 men, including the deputy commander of the 30th Regiment, were killed or wounded, and 900 men, including the regimental adjutant of the 30th Regiment and two battalion commanders, were captured. Seven mortars, nine 60mm mortars, ten heavy machine guns, thirty light machine guns, three grenade launchers, over 400 rifles, three submachine guns, three radio stations, thirty war horses, and countless ammunition and military supplies were seized.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Jilu Yu, January 17th] Guo Peide, a notorious Japanese spy who served as a puppet army leader for eight years (commander of the 4th Brigade under the puppet army Wang Jinxiang), was killed by a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army on the afternoon of the 2nd in the Huzizhuang and Mizhuang areas, ten miles east of Boping.
