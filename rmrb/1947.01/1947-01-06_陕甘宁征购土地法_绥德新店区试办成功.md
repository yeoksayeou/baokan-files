Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government's method of issuing land bonds to requisition excess land from landlords in areas where land has not yet been distributed, and then distributing it to farmers, has been successfully piloted in the Xindian District of Suide. 42% of local farming households, totaling 225 households and 991 people, have obtained land, acquiring 1,193 *shangs* of land and 27 cave dwellings. Before the land requisition, the Border Region work team first widely explained the land bond regulations to the masses. Subsequently, with the township farmers' association as the main body, a requisition committee was formed by village representatives and impartial individuals (farmers who neither requisitioned nor acquired land). The committee also invited landlords to assess the grade and price of the excess land. The price was set at 4.5 *dous* of millet per *shang* for top-grade land, 3 *dous* for medium-grade land, and 1.5 *dous* for low-grade land, and 1.5 *shis* for each cave dwelling. After the land requisition, the land retained by each person in the landlord's family was at least half to one times more than the local average landholding of middle peasants, with a maximum of one to four times more. All the land cultivated by their own labor was retained. For example, in Hejiashi Village, seven landlord families with only 57 people retained a total of 272 *shangs* of land, averaging 4.8 *shangs* per person, and this land was closer to the village and of better quality. Landlord Dang Zhongkun (who works in the county government and is not a Communist Party member) originally had 63.5 *shangs* of land cultivated by himself and hired labor (excluding land rented out). According to the regulations, he should have retained 65 *shangs* of land this time, but he was unwilling to take back even half a *shang* of land from the farmers. At a mass meeting, he said: "I very much welcome the implementation of land bonds. Land was not earned by our ancestors; it was obtained by exploiting the peasants. The peasants should be the masters of the land." He voluntarily dedicated his requisitioned land to the peasants without compensation. Landlord Dang Ziren expressed that he would no longer "open his mouth to eat and stretch out his hand to dress," and prepared to work himself, hiring half a laborer for production. Dang Wenxuan, who rose to become a rich peasant through his own hard work, said: "The implementation of land bonds is a great encouragement to people like us who have become wealthy through labor." The vast number of hired laborers felt that the rent reduction and interest reduction of the past few years was only half a liberation, while this time they had achieved full liberation. Poor peasant Liu Yilin's family of eight had only four *shangs* of mortgaged land, and at the age of 36 he was still a bachelor. This time he acquired 15.5 *shangs* of land. He happily said to people: "Now that I have land, I must cultivate it well and produce more grain. I won't have to worry about finding a wife in the future, and no one can take this land away from me. If the reactionaries come, I will fight them to the death." Village cadres actively participated in this work from beginning to end. Feng Shichang, the director of the farmers' association, had bloodshot eyes due to overwork. When the whole township held a mass meeting to announce the number of land to be purchased by each family, men and women, old and young, dressed in red and green, went to the meeting. The Wangjiagou band in the township voluntarily came to play music. People smiled and celebrated their liberation, and the militia holding red-tasseled spears shouted "Arm the defense of the land and the border region!" The slogans echoed through the valleys.

    陕甘宁征购土地法
    绥德新店区试办成功
    【新华社延安二十七日电】陕甘宁边区政府，在土地未经分配区域，发行土地公债征购地主超额土地分配给农民的办法，已在绥德新店区试办成功。当地百分之四十二的农户已获得土地，计有二百廿五户，九百九十一人，承购土地一千一百九十三垧，及土石窑二十七孔。征购土地前，边府工作团首将土地公债条例对群众广泛解释，继以乡农会为主，由村代表及公正人士（既不征购也不承购的农民），合组征购委员会，并邀地主评定超额土地之等级及地价。计上地每垧地价小米四斗五升，中地三斗，下地一斗五升，窑洞每孔一石五斗。征办土地后，地主家中每人所留土地，至少比当地中农每人平均地数多半倍至一倍，最高为一倍至四倍，而其自力耕种之土地，则全部留给。如贺家石村七户地主仅五十七人，共留地二百七十二垧，每人平均四点八垧，且为离村较近土质较优之土地。地主党仲昆（在县府工作非共产党员），原来有自种和雇人种地六十三垧半（租出土地在外），此次征购中按条例应留地六十五，但他不愿从农民手中收回一垧半地，在群众大会上他说：“我非常欢迎实行土地公债，土地不是祖先赚下的，是靠剥削农民得来的，农民应该是土地的主人。”他自愿将自己被征购的土地无偿献给农民。地主党自仁，表示今后再不“张口吃饭，伸手穿衣”准备自己劳动，并雇半个工生产。由自己辛勤劳动而上升为富农的党文选说：“实行土地公债，对于我们这种劳动发家的人，正是一个极大的鼓励。”广大的雇农，更认为几年来的减租查减是半翻身，此次则已获得全翻身。贫农刘义林一家八口人，只有四垧典地，年三十六岁了还是光棍汉，这次承购了十五垧半地，他快活地对人说：“有了土地就要好好务育，多打粮食，将来讨老婆也不愁，咱这地谁也不能抢走。反动派要来非跟他拚死命不成。”乡村干部自始至终积极参加这一工作，农会主任冯世昌，因工作疲劳过度，双眼挂上血丝。当全乡召开群众大会宣布各家应购土地目数时，男女老少穿红着绿齐赴会场，该乡王家沟一班吹鼓手，自动前来吹奏。人们喜笑颜开，欢庆翻身节日，手执红缨枪的自卫军，高呼“武装保卫土地和边区”，口号震彻山谷。
