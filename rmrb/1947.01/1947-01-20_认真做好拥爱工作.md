	Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Supporting the Army and Cherishing the People

	The annual Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Families of Soldiers and Revolutionary Martyrs, and Support the Government and Cherish the People Month in the Liberated Areas is approaching. In the past year, the People's Liberation Army, in order to strive for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland, and to protect the bright and happy lives of all the people in the Liberated Areas, spared no effort, braved dangers, and fought bravely with a spirit of self-sacrifice, achieving brilliant victories. All the Chinese people place their hopes on this ever-victorious army whose fame震震远 (transcends borders). The people of the Liberated Areas, who have turned over and are living a stable and happy life, remember the source of their happiness and show boundless enthusiasm and gratitude in cherishing their own Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, Northeast Democratic Allied Army, Democratic National Construction Army, Central China Democratic Allied Army, Northwest Democratic Allied Army, Democratic League Army, and all other People's Liberation Army units, as well as the broad masses of militia and guerrillas. They all deeply recognize that without such an army that resolutely serves the people, there would be no free world in the vast Liberated Areas, nor could there be the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland. Everything has been exchanged for by the blood and flesh of our heroic soldiers. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Zhu called on "all the people of our Liberated Areas to further strengthen the work of supporting the front, to strengthen our military production, to ensure good supplies to the front, to conscientiously manage, inspect, and care for the wounded and sick, to take care of the lives of honorary soldiers and the families of soldiers, and to ensure that they obtain land." Commander-in-Chief Zhu told us that this is one of the important tasks of the self-defense war, and we must complete this glorious task.
	During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, our Liberated Areas resisted most of the Japanese army and almost all the puppet troops, making the greatest contribution. The rural areas of the Liberated Areas suffered the most severe damage. Today, the army and people of the Liberated Areas are once again forced to rise up and resist Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. The scale of this war and the intensity of the fighting are unprecedented in the history of civil wars, and the people's burden is bound to be unprecedentedly heavy. In some areas, due to the inevitable difficulties, even very serious difficulties, in military supplies in terms of civilian and financial resources, although these difficulties are difficulties in our victory and can be overcome, we must have a full and serious understanding of these difficulties, and the army and people must cooperate fully to overcome them. Our troops should pay special attention to this. Commander-in-Chief Zhu called on us: "All troops must not relax the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people for a moment, must not relax the work of helping peasants carry out land reform for a moment, strictly implement and regularly check the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, always and everywhere benefit the people and eliminate evils, save civilian labor as much as possible, help the people solve the difficulties caused by the war, and help the people produce. The rear troops should also produce for themselves as much as possible." Commander-in-Chief Zhu repeatedly told us not to forget for a moment that "the people are the source of our strength, and we must maintain the true colors of our people's army, which fights, produces, and does mass work." Commander-in-Chief Zhu also called on all the People's Liberation Army: "Precisely because the war is cruel, it is even more necessary to make the people understand for whom we are fighting, and the people need our help and love even more." We must remember these teachings and instructions, and we must complete this glorious task.
	The work of supporting the army and cherishing the people is an important key to winning the victory of the self-defense war, because the guarantee of our victory is none other than the unity and resolute struggle of the emancipated peasants and the people's army. The victory of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War and the one-year self-defense war proves the superior characteristic of people's war, which far surpasses any latest weapons. An army extremely hated by the people, whether it was the Japanese invaders in the past or Chiang's army today, is destined to fail. However, the army and people of the Liberated Areas must never be complacent. In order to welcome a greater victory in 1947 and to welcome the bright future to come, we demand to further strengthen the unity between the army and the people in the Liberated Areas. The army and the people should do their best to help each other, and at the same time understand and sympathize with each other's difficulties and demands. At the same time, by launching self-criticism, we should deeply review the relationship between the military, government, and the people in logistics, supply, participation in the war, and all other specific work and daily life, in order to further enhance the enthusiasm of the masses to support the army and support the front, strengthen the sense of base areas of commanders and fighters, and all concepts of relying on the masses, help the masses carry out land reform, save civilian and financial resources, and support long-term war; this should be especially emphasized in the guerrilla areas. The education of the excellent traditions and the education of the idea of supporting the army and cherishing the people in the troops must be deepened. During the Lunar New Year, we must conscientiously pay attention to checking the discipline of the troops, conscientiously investigate and compensate for the losses of the masses, wish the masses a happy new year, hold get-togethers, and various entertainment and educational activities. For the people who have encountered misfortunes due to the war, we must provide sincere condolences and help. A large number of new elements have recently poured into our troops. Some of them have just been liberated from the old army and do not yet have enough understanding of the characteristics of the people's army and the people's war. Their styles and habits are also very different, so we must pay more attention to education. In recent months, the People's Liberation Army in various places has not only achieved great victories militarily, but also created a lot of valuable experience in combining logistics work, land reform, and the self-defense war. For example, in some areas of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong and Henan, the civilian porters and stretcher teams have sound organizations, strict systems, rapid and effective traffic connections, mobilization and demobilization at any time, seizing production at any time, and conducting education at any time, so that the waste of civilian labor is reduced to the minimum. Many areas use the interval between battles to carry out mutual aid production between the army and the people. We should universally adopt such experience, and better develop it according to the local and current situation, create more and better methods, and provide more favorable conditions for the self-defense war. It should be especially pointed out that the experience of previous years has proved that the main link of the movement to support the army and cherish the people is the army's work of supporting the government and cherishing the people; if this work is done well, the government's work of supporting the army will surely be done better.
	The Month of Supporting the Army and Cherishing the People in 1947 should be a month for carrying out the work of supporting the army and cherishing the people on a large scale. In this month, we have many tasks to do, such as carrying out ideological education on supporting the army and cherishing the people, holding symposiums of the military, government, and the people, commending model cases and heroic figures in the battles and mass movements, conducting criticism, apologies, compensation, and so on. These tasks must be done conscientiously. After this month of intensive efforts, we will then establish, reorganize, and strengthen the regular organizations and systems for supporting the army and cherishing the people, so that they will be lasting and universal. In this way, the internal unity of the Liberated Areas will surely be unprecedentedly consolidated, and will provide a solid guarantee for the final victory of the patriotic self-defense war.

### 认真做好拥爱工作

　　认真做好拥爱工作
    解放区一年一度的拥军优抗、拥政爱民月即将来临。在以往的一年中，人民解放军为了争取祖国的独立和平与民主，为了保卫解放区全体人民光明幸福的生活，不辞辛劳，不避艰危，以自我牺牲的精神奋勇作战，取得了辉煌的胜利，全中国人民都把他们的希望寄托在这威名远震的常胜军身上。而翻身过着安居乐业生活的解放区人民，饮水思源，更以无限热忱与感谢爱护他们自己的八路军、新四军、东北民主联军、民主建国军、华中民主联军、西北民主联军、民主同盟军与其他一切人民解放军及广大民兵、游击队。他们都深刻的认识到没有这样坚决为人民服务的军队，就没有这样广大解放区的自由天地，也就不能有祖国的独立和平与民主，一切都是由我们的英勇将士们用血肉换来的。因此，朱总司令号召“我们全解放区的人民，要更加加强支援前线的工作，要加强我们的军事生产，保证对于前线的良好供给，认真管理和检查护理伤病员，照顾荣誉军人和战士家属的生活，并保证他们获得土地”。朱总司令告诉我们，这是自卫战争的重要任务之一，我们一定要完成这一光荣的任务。
    抗战八年中，我们解放区军民抗击了大部日军和几乎全部伪军，出力最大，解放区农村遭受的破坏也最重。今天解放区军民又被迫起而抵抗蒋介石的进攻，这一战争规模之大，战斗之激烈，在内战史上是空前的，人民的负担必然是空前巨大。某些地区，由于军事的供应在民力和财力上都不可避免地会有困难，以至很严重的困难；虽然这些困难是我们胜利中的困难，是能够克服的，但对这些困难要有充分的严重的认识，军民合作全力来克服它。我们的部队对此应该特别重视。朱总司令号召我们：“一切部队不要片刻放松拥政爱民工作，不要片刻放松帮助农民进行土地改革工作，严格执行和经常检查三大纪律、八项注意，随时随地为民兴利除弊，十分节省民力，帮助人民解决战争引起的困难，帮助人民生产。后方的部队还要尽可能为自己生产。”朱总司令再三告诉我们，不要有一刻忘记“人民是我们力量的源泉，要保持我们人民军队，既打仗、又生产、又做群众工作的本色”。朱总司令又号召全体人民解放军说：“正因为战争是残酷的，就更加需要使人民了解我们是为谁而战，人民也就更加需要我们的帮助爱护”。我们要记住这些教导和指示，我们一定要完成这一光荣任务。
    拥爱工作是争取自卫战争胜利的一个重要关键，因为我们胜利的保证不是别的，正就是翻身农民与人民军队的团结一致，坚决奋斗。八年抗战、一年自卫战争的胜利，证明了人民战争这一优越的特点，远胜任何最新式的武器。为人民所极端仇视的军队，不论过去的日寇与今天的蒋军，是注定要失败的。但是，解放区军民永远不能自满，为了迎接一九四七年更大的胜利，迎接行将来到的光明前途，我们要求更进一步加强解放区军民的团结。军民双方要互相尽力帮助，同时要互相了解和体谅对方的困难与要求，同时以展开自我批评的方法，深刻检讨在后勤、供给、参战及其他一切具体工作中与日常生活中的军政民的关系，以更加提高群众拥军和支援前线的热情，加强指战员的根据地观念，和一切依靠群众的观念，帮助群众进行土地改革，节省民力财力，支持长期战争；这在游击区尤其应该重视。部队中的优良传统的教育和拥爱思想教育必须加深进行，在旧历正月中，要切实注意检查部队的纪律，切实清查和赔偿群众的损失，向群众贺年，举行联欢会，及各种娱乐教育工作。对因战争而遇难的人民，要切实进行慰问和帮助。我们部队中最近涌入了大量新成分，他们的一部分是刚从旧军队解放过来，对人民军队与人民战争的特点还有了解不够的地方，作风习惯也有许多不同，所以更要注意教育。近数月来，各地人民解放军不但在军事上获得巨大的胜利，同时在后勤工作、土地改革与自卫战争相结合等方面，已创造了不少宝贵的经验。如晋冀鲁豫某些地区，已经做到民夫担架队有健全的组织，严密的制度，迅速有效的交通联络，随时动员随时复员，随时抓紧生产，随时进行教育，使民力浪费减少到最低限度。许多地区则利用战斗间隙，开展军民互助生产。像这样的经验，我们要普遍采用，并按当地当时情况更好的发挥，创造更多更好的办法，为自卫战争提供更多有利的条件。特别应该指出：历年的经验证明，拥爱运动的主要环节，是军队的拥政爱民工作；这一工作做好，政府的拥军工作一定会做的更好。
    一九四七年的拥爱月，应该是大规模开展拥爱工作的月份。在这一个月中，我们有许多工作要做，如进行拥爱思想教育，召开军政民的座谈会，表扬战斗中与群众运动中的模范事例、英雄人物，进行批评，道歉、赔偿等等。这些工作必须认真做好，经过这一个月紧张的努力，接着就建立与整理、加强拥爱的经常组织与制度，使其持久普遍。这样，解放区的内部团结，一定能够空前的巩固，给爱国自卫战争的最后胜利以坚实的保证。（一月十八日）
