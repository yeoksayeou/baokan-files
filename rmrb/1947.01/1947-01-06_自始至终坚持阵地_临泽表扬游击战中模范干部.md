    Steadfastly Holding Ground
    Linze Commends Model Cadres in Guerrilla Warfare
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch, 1st] The Linze County Command recently commended model cadres in the guerrilla war over the past month. These comrades have all resoundingly answered the Party's call to render meritorious service to the people and have created many exemplary achievements. Comrade Xie Mingqi, the district head of the Second District, led nine militiamen back to the Second District to harass the enemy on the second day after the enemy occupied the county. When the situation was dire, he immediately took the lead in joining the army, leading the county security team and the Second District detachment to operate deep in the heart of the Chiang army's area. On the eve of the recovery of Linze, he led the militia on an eighty-mile march to raid the Penglou and other puppet township governments in the Second District. Comrade Zhang Shangyi, director of the Joint Association of the First District, organized a work team to persist in working in the district on the second day after the enemy occupied it, and settled the disaster-stricken people after the Juan’nan battle. After the enemy occupied Juancheng, he led the militia and cadres of the First District back to the district to continue working. Once, while chasing the team on official business, he ran more than a hundred miles through ditches and water all night. The next day, he encountered the Yuncheng enemy retreating to Heze and was chased by the enemy, but he broke through very calmly and brought the people and weapons of the First District back safely. Comrade Bian Luji, director of the Joint Association of the Third District, braved the enemy's artillery fire from Juanbei to find the district cadres and militiamen when the enemy's army was pressing down. After the second withdrawal, he organized a work team of a dozen people and returned to the Third District to persist for a day and a night. When the Yuncheng enemy retreated, he was chased by the enemy again, so he led eleven people to break through, and the people and weapons were unharmed. The next day, when the enemy retreated, he rushed back to his district overnight to organize recovery work. His stomach ailment was very serious, but he still led the armed forces in the front to block the enemy. Comrade Gao Yuan, instructor of the Fifth District, whose district had once left the leadership of the county and acted independently, safely preserved the armed forces and cadres. After the victory in Juannan, he led the entire district's armed forces back to the district to carry out post-war work. After the entire county was recovered, he cooperated with the brigade to drive away the traitors in the district in two days, repelled the attack of more than a hundred enemies in Qizhuang, and recovered two large carts of grain and returned them to the masses. He had repelled countless enemy attacks and strengthened the people's confidence in victory. Comrade Liu Airan, instructor of the Sixth District, had been standing on the front line at all times since the fall of Caozhou. Every time he set out for battle, he led the team himself. When the enemy retreated south, Comrade Liu accepted the order from his superiors and led Zhao Gan, Chen and nine other comrades to cover the safety of the brigade across the river. In the battle of Shagang, he repelled the attack of three hundred enemies, relieved the siege of the Fifth Detachment, and captured a traitor alive. At the joint meeting of district secretaries to discuss how to persist in guerrilla warfare, Comrade Liu first said: "As long as our leaders take the lead, everyone can persevere."

    自始至终坚持阵地
    临泽表扬游击战中模范干部
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】临泽县指挥部顷表扬月余来在游击战争中的模范干部。这些同志都响亮的回答了党的为人民立功的号召，创造了不少模范事绩。谢明启同志是二区区长，敌人进占该县的第二天，即带领九个民兵回到二区袭扰敌人，情况恶劣时，他立刻带头参军，带领县保卫队及二区区队，深入蒋军腹心地区活动。在收复临泽的前夜，他带着民兵经八十里的长途行军，奔袭二区彭楼等伪乡公所。张尚义同志是一区联合会主任，敌人进占后第二天，即组织武工队在本区坚持工作，鄄南战役后即安插被难群众。敌人占鄄城后，他带领一区民兵、干部又回区坚持工作。有一次，他因公追赶队伍，翻沟踏水，一夜跑了百余里，第二天遇着郓城敌人往荷泽退却，又遭到敌人的追击，但他却很沉着的突了围，将一区人枪安全的带回来。边鲁吉同志是三区联合会主任，敌人大军压境时，他从鄄北冒着敌人的炮火独自来找区里干部民兵。第二次退出后，又组织了十几人的武工队，回到三区坚持一天一夜。郓城敌人退却时，又遭到敌人的追击，他就带领十一人突围，人枪无损。第二天，敌人退却，他又连夜赶回本区，组织恢复工作。他的胃病已非常厉害，仍领导武装在前面阻击敌人。高垣同志是五区指导员，他区曾一度离开了县的领导，单独活动，他安然保存了武装和干部。鄄南胜利后，又带领全区武装回区进行善后工作。全县收复后，配合大队两天把本区汉奸赶跑，在齐庄打退百余敌人的进攻，夺回两大车粮食还给群众。他曾打退敌人无数次的进攻，坚定了群众胜利信心。刘蔼然同志是六区指导员，自曹州失陷后，时时刻刻站在最前线，每次出发战斗都是他亲自带领着。敌人向南退却时，刘同志接受上级命令，带领赵干臣等九同志掩护大队安全过河。沙岗之战，击退三百敌人的进攻，给五区队解围，并活捉汉奸一名。在区书联席会上讨论如何坚持游击战争时，刘同志首先说：“只要咱领导上起模范作用，大家就能坚持。”
