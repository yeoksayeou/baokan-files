　　Implementing the Mass Line in Leadership
    Taihang Textile Heroines Promote Women's Textile Work
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Comprehensive reports from various counties in Taihang: Over the past year, textile heroes in various regions have achieved great success in developing textile work by following the mass line. Hao Zhan'e, a textile heroine from Cejing, Shahe, persuaded women of all kinds to participate in textile work. To the military families who were unwilling to spin, she said, "We are military families, and people think highly of us. We should set an example in labor. Our men are fighting the enemy at the front, and we are producing at home. This is glorious!" To the lazy women who love to eat, she said, "This year we have received some fruits of the struggle, but we are not completely liberated. We must spin well in order to ensure that we have food and clothing." As a result, all kinds of women started spinning. In Hanzhuang, Huguan, the spinning women were unwilling to help each other through labor exchange. Wu Shu'e, a textile heroine, calculated the accounts for everyone, showing how the ten people in the Haizhen group, through labor exchange, turned ten catties of cotton into cloth in twelve days, making it clear that mutual assistance and labor exchange saved labor and brought more benefits. The whole village then organized itself. Li Xiulian, a textile heroine from Xiazhuang, Licheng, combined with the masses to change the system in a timely manner and improve textile efficiency. Her group initially weaved cloth together and distributed dividends equally. Soon, some members became passive but did not say anything. She studied the situation, thinking that the good workers were afraid of losing out, so she convened a meeting and changed the system to distribute dividends according to the amount of cloth woven by each person, but this led to the phenomenon of only caring about speed and not quality. She then changed the system again to make the finished product belong to the individual, which improved quality but reduced speed. Finally, through democratic discussion, they came up with a method of distributing dividends according to good, bad, fast, and slow, as well as a system of rewarding progress, which greatly improved textile efficiency. Liu Zhongjing, a textile heroine from Beiliu, used practical education to promote new tools and improve technology. The women in the village were afraid that the finished products would not be good when they first learned, so they were unwilling to change to shuttle looms. She put good thread on the loom and convened a meeting of group leaders and activists. She weaved on the loom, and everyone saw it and said, "This is good, this is good, it's fast and fine!" They all went to try the machine, and she taught them. As a result, all thirty-two earthen looms were converted to shuttle looms. The women in Zizhen wanted to spin but did not have cotton or looms. Yang Caifeng, a textile heroine, combined with the cooperative to supply cotton to the spinning women. She first made a loom for the whole group to use, first cultivating activists, influencing and promoting others to make looms and spin. Chen Gaixiang, a textile heroine from Nanpianqiao, Xiangyuan, saw that Guo's daughter spun cotton for others all year round, but could not afford to change her clothes for the season, so she lent her a catty of cotton as capital. Two months later, Guo was wearing new clothes. Tian Guilin, a textile heroine from Beiling, Taigu, saw that three impoverished women in the village could not afford cotton, so she mobilized her husband to say, "Sell a stone of rice and lend money to others as capital. If they have cloth, they won't lack rice, and they will pay it back!" As a result, they lent ten catties of cotton, enabling them to be self-sufficient in clothing. Most of the women in Beiliu had poor skills. Liu Zhongjing personally trained activists in the group and then let them lead. She said, "Now you are like graduates of junior high school, you have to go to the countryside to lead the masses!" Everyone was very happy, so they organized four teams and twenty groups, and even little girls in their teens learned to spin. The contradiction between family life and textile work was also a major obstacle to the development of the textile movement. Textile heroes in various regions have successfully solved this problem through labor exchange, family meetings, and family dividend distribution. Hao Zhan'e let Shuangcheng, who had two children, and her sister-in-law exchange labor, letting her sister-in-law take care of her children, and her son hoeing the land for her sister-in-law. Not only could she spin, but her sister-in-law's land was also hoeed. Ji Jingai's and Yixin's mothers-in-law were afraid that their daughters-in-law would delay family work, so they would not let them participate in textile work. Hao Zhan'e separately told her mothers-in-law, "First let her spin ten catties of cotton for you, and then give you 40% of the dividends she earns later." In less than ten days, ten catties of cloth had been handed over to the mother-in-law, and she was given more than 400 yuan in dividends, and the mother-in-law always encouraged her daughter-in-law to spin. Ning Ernv, a textile heroine from Neiqiu, held a parents' meeting once a month to understand and solve specific difficulties. After group member Shi Xianni and others participated in textile work, they did less housework, which aroused the dissatisfaction of their mothers-in-law and men. They established a system of distributing dividends between the family and the individual in a 30/70 split. Xianni's mother-in-law then automatically took on all the chores, and the family became harmonious. After Liu Guihua, a textile heroine from Yanghe, Xingtai, organized a textile factory, she also held a parents' meeting to listen to opinions. She found that no one sewed cotton clothes in winter, so she organized elderly women to sew them, so that textile work and family life were not delayed. When Hao Heting's small factory in Wu'an was established, her younger brother wanted to participate, but her husband did not want him to because the two had a bad relationship, fearing that she would be provoked to divorce at the factory. After Heting persuaded him, she let her younger brother participate, but she was still not at ease and eavesdropped outside the factory window every night, often hearing everyone weaving while persuading her younger brother to have a good life with his wife and establish a family. This not only dispelled her younger brother's husband's fear of the factory, but also made him willing for her younger brother to enter the factory, and the couple's relationship gradually improved. In collective work, women inevitably have small opinions, which affect work. Li Xiulian's factory has regular review meetings to carry out self-criticism and mutual criticism. Wang Chunxia liked to satirize people. After being criticized by everyone, she consciously overcame her shortcomings. (This Newspaper Information Office)

　　贯彻群众路线领导
    太行纺英推动妇纺
    【本报特讯】综合太行各县报导：一年来各地纺织英雄走群众路线发展纺织获很大成绩。沙河册井纺织英雄郝占娥说服各种妇女参加纺织，对不愿纺织的军属说：“咱是军属，人家都高看咱，劳动该起模范。男人在前方打敌人，咱在家生产，这才是光荣呢！”对好吃懒做的妇女说：“今年咱分了些斗争果实，还不算翻透了身，还要好好纺织，才能保住有吃有穿。”结果各种各样的妇女都纺织起来。壶关韩庄纺妇不愿互助变工，纺织英雄午书娥便把海珍组十个人变工、十二天就把十斤花变成布的账算给大家听，明确了互助变工省工多得利，全村即组织起来。黎城霞庄纺织英雄李秀莲结合群众及时改变制度，提高纺织效率。她组开始伙织布，平均分红，不久有的组员表现消极，但不吭气。她研究是好把式怕吃亏，就召集会议改为每人按织布数量分红，但又产生只顾快不顾质现象；再改为成品归自己，质提高了，速度却又减退；最后民主讨论出按好、坏、快、慢分红的办法及奖励进步的制度，纺织效率即大为提高。北流纺织英雄刘仲景用实际教育推广新工具，提高技术，该村妇女怕初学时成品不好，不愿换拉梭机，她就把好线子经到机上，召集组长积极分子会议，她在机上织，大家看见都说：“这好，这好，又快又细！”都上机试，她就教，结果三十二架土机全改了拉梭机。子镇妇女要纺织没有棉花和机子，纺织英雄杨彩凤即结合合作社给纺妇供给棉花，自己先打一架机供全组用，先培养出积极分子，影响推动别人都打机纺织。襄垣南偏桥纺织英雄陈改香见郭闺女整年给人纺花，自己却换不了季，就借给她一斤花作本，两月后郭即穿上了新衣。太谷北岭纺织英雄田桂林见村里三个赤贫妇女买不起花，即动员她自己丈夫说：“卖一石米借钱给人家作本吧，有了布不缺米，人家会还回来的！”结果借给了十斤花，使她们达到了穿衣自给。北流大部妇女技术差，刘仲景自己动手在组内培养积极分子，再让她们去领导，她说：“现在你们就像住高小毕业了，要下乡领导群众！”大家很高兴，遂分头组织了四个队，二十个组，连十几岁的小闺女都学会了纺花。家庭生活和纺织的矛盾，也是纺织运动开展的很大阻碍，各地纺织英雄都以变工、家庭会议和家庭分红等办法顺利解决了。郝占娥让有两个孩子的双成和嫂变工，让嫂给她带孩子，她的小子给她嫂锄地，不仅她能纺织，她嫂的地也锄了。即井改的、义心的婆子怕媳妇耽误家里活，不让她去参加纺织，郝占娥就分别给她婆子说：“先叫她给你纺织十斤花，以后赚下钱再给你分四成红。”不到十几天，十斤布已交给婆子，又给她分了四百多元红利，婆子时刻鼓励媳妇纺织了。内邱纺织英雄宁二女一月开一次家长会议，了解并解决具体困难。组员石仙妮等参加纺织后，少作了家里活，引起婆子、男人不满，订出与家庭三七分红制度，仙妮婆子遂自动担当了一切杂活，家庭顿形和睦。邢台羊河纺织英雄刘桂花组织了纺织工厂后，亦开家长会议听取意见，发现冬天没人缝棉衣，乃另外组织老年妇女缝，纺织与家庭生活两不耽误。武安郝何廷的小工厂成立时，从弟要参加，但她男人因俩人感情不好，怕她到了工厂受人挑拨闹离婚不愿意。经何廷劝说后让从弟参加了，但仍不放心，每天晚上到工厂窗外偷听，常常听见大家边织布边劝从弟好好和男人过日子，建立家务，不仅打破了从弟丈夫对工厂的害怕，而且愿意从弟进工厂，夫妇感情亦渐趋和好。集体工作中，妇女难免闹小意见，影响工作，李秀莲工厂里有定期检讨会，开展自我批评与互相批评，王春霞好讽刺人，经过大家批评后，自觉的克服了缺点。（本报资料室）
