　　Fighting Bravely to Eliminate Harm for the People
    Officers and Soldiers Vie to Be First in the Liberation of Liaocheng
    In the battle to liberate Liaocheng, our local troops fought shoulder to shoulder with the field army, demonstrating vigorous morale and tenacious combat effectiveness. Before entering the battle, each battalion of a certain regiment of the × Division requested to take on the main attack and challenged the field army. Li Jianyi, the commander of the sixth company of a certain battalion, handed over 10,000 yuan in savings, determined to eliminate harm for the people. He wrote in a letter to his superiors: "If the traitorous bandits refuse to surrender their guns, I guarantee that the entire company will fight to the death with bayonets." Lu Jinglin, the deputy company commander of the fifth company, received a letter from home asking him to return for marriage, to which he replied, "I will not return until Liaocheng is liberated." The second company of the regiment persisted for four hours under intense enemy fire and erected a 70-meter-long wooden bridge, with only four casualties. The regiment's engineering team continuously blew up the city walls, and the grenade-throwing team provided cover, with no casualties. At the start of the general offensive, the regiment was the first to erect a large ladder measuring 4.5 zhang (approximately 15 meters) in height, greatly encouraging the friendly neighboring units. The deputy commander of the × unit of the field army highly praised the regiment, saying to his subordinate units, "Although they are local troops, they are resolute and thorough in performing their tasks, and their actions are brave and well-coordinated, which we should learn from."

    (From our correspondent on the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, 7th) In the battle to liberate Liaocheng, after our army's × unit heard the local people's complaints about the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, everyone gnashed their teeth, determined to eliminate harm for the people. When the attack on the city began and the charge had not yet been launched, soldiers of a certain regiment automatically rushed to the breach opened by the artillery fire. All other non-combat personnel also worked hard day and night for the liberation of Liaocheng. Several cooks cooked and delivered meals during the day and carried the wounded at night, not sleeping for three days and three nights. The telephonists Li Shunqing and Guo Fuxiang, in addition to completing their own work, also went to help with heating water and delivering meals to the front lines. Ordnance officer Hu Chengxin transported ammunition to the positions, going three times in one night. In addition, three ordnance officers, regardless of all difficulties, prepared all the materials for making ladders in one night. The health department arranged for 45 wounded soldiers in two hours. They applied medicine, dressed them, fed them, and laid them comfortably on thick straw and mattresses. Deputy Director Pan and Instructor Liu also took off their coats and covered them. All the personnel of the logistics office wrote letters to the attacking troops, guaranteeing that they would eat white flour every day during the battle, that ammunition would be delivered on time, and that the wounded would be cared for with charcoal fires, treating the wounded soldiers like their own parents; and that they would strengthen communication and reporting work, so that no heroic deeds of any hero would be buried. Comrade Xie Yingtong, head of the civil affairs section, also donated two silver dollars that had been given to him by his lover and kept for sixteen months to the fighting heroes who had rendered meritorious service in attacking the city.

    【本报冀鲁豫前线七日电】解放聊城之役，我军×部听到当地群众哭诉蒋伪军暴行后，个个咬牙切齿决心为民除害，当开始攻城尚未发起冲锋时，某团战士即自动向炮火轰开的缺口涌去，其他一切非战斗人员亦不分昼夜为解放聊城而坚苦工作，几个炊事员白天做饭送饭，晚上抬伤员，三天三夜没有睡觉，摇机员李顺清郭福祥在完成本身工作之外又去帮助烧锅，到火线上送饭。军械员胡成信往阵地运送弹药，一夜连去三次。另外三个军械员不顾一切困难，在一夜中准备好所有做梯子的材料。卫生处在两个钟头内安置了四十五个伤员。帮他们上好药，穿好衣服，喂了饭，很舒适地躺在厚厚的乱草和褥子上。潘副主任、刘指导员并把自己身上的大衣脱下来给他们盖上。后勤办事处的全体人员写信给攻城部队，保证作战中每天能吃白面，弹药按时送到，伤员有木炭火烤，用对待父母的态度来照顾伤兵同志；并加强通讯报导工作，不使任何一个英雄的英勇事迹埋没。民运科长谢迎亭同志并将自己爱人所赠保存了十六个月的两块银元，捐赠攻城立功的战斗英雄。
