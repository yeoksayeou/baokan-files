    Liberated Peasants in Taiyue Area
    Pay New Year Greetings to Chairman Mao in Every Household
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 29th] In the Taiyue area, liberated peasants universally venerate and offer sacrifices to Chairman Mao's portrait during the Lunar New Year, paying New Year greetings to Chairman Mao. In Xiguan, Yangcheng, every household displays a portrait of Chairman Mao, and the first thing the whole family does on the first day of the Lunar New Year is to pay New Year greetings to Chairman Mao. Ma Bicheng said: "When drinking water, don't forget the well-digger; after liberation, don't forget Chairman Mao. Thank you, Chairman Mao, for your good leadership." Cheng Village in Jiyuan used to be a stronghold of feudal forces. During festivals, intellectuals had to go to the Confucius Temple to burn incense and kowtow. This year, after liberation, the peasants realize that they can only rely on Chairman Mao, and the intellectuals have asked Confucius to step down, prominently hanging Chairman Mao's portrait. Shang Village replaced the former shrine with a large portrait of Chairman Mao, and the entire village collectively paid New Year greetings to Chairman Mao. A few days before the New Year in Gaoping, the bookstore sold out all the portraits of Chairman Mao, but the liberated peasants kept coming to buy more. The bookstore printed some itself, and although the printing wasn't very good, everyone still rushed to buy them. During the New Year, every household hung up a portrait of Chairman Mao. In other places such as Jincheng, Shimin, Qinshui, Tunliu, and Qinyuan, if they couldn't buy a portrait of Chairman Mao, they would ask the school teacher to draw one or collectively pay New Year greetings to Chairman Mao.

    太岳各地翻身农民
    家家给毛主席拜年
    【本报太岳二十九日电】太岳各地翻身农民在旧历新年普遍敬供毛主席像，向毛主席拜年。阳城西关家家供着毛主席像，大年初一第一件事情全家人向毛主席拜年。马笔成说：吃水不忘掏井人，翻身不忘毛主席，谢谢毛主席的领导好。”济源程村曾是封建势力统治的老窝，每遇年节知识分子都得去孔庙烧香叩头，今年翻身后，农民认识只有靠毛主席，知识分子都请孔夫子退位了，高悬毛主席像。尚庄将过去的神棚改换悬挂毛主席大像，全村农民集体向毛主席拜年。高平过年前几天，书店就把毛主席像卖完了，可是翻身农民络绎不绝要求再买，书店自己印了一些，虽然印得不好，大家还是争着要买。过年家家挂起毛主席像。其他晋城、士敏、沁水、屯留、沁源等地，买不到毛主席像，请学校先生画或集体向毛主席拜年。
