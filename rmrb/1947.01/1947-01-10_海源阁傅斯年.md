    Haiyuan Pavilion and Fu Sinian

    General Liu Bocheng’s troops entered Liaocheng on New Year's Day. Before entering the city, he ordered the entire army to carry out three tasks: (1) Stand at attention and pay respects to the tomb of the national hero General Fan Zhuxian; (2) Protect Haiyuan Pavilion, one of China's three major libraries; (3) Properly protect the residence of the Chinese historian Mr. Fu Sinian. This illustrates how the People's Army respects national heroes, national culture, and scholars. However, according to reports from our front-line reporters, General Fan’s tomb still stands majestically, while Mr. Fu's residence has been destroyed into a pile of rubble by Wang Jinxiang's bandit troops of the Kuomintang. Whether Haiyuan Pavilion is safe is still unknown!

    "Haiyuan Pavilion" is a large library. During the Qing Dynasty, Yang Yizeng of Liaocheng rose to the position of Director-General of the Yellow River Conservancy. He loved nothing more than collecting books, eventually acquiring hundreds of thousands of volumes. He built a large building to house them, naming it "Haiyuan Pavilion" and publishing a series called "Haiyuan Pavilion Series." His son, Yang Shaohe, compiled "Marginal Records of Inscriptions" and collected many fine Song and Yuan editions, building another "Song Preservation Room" to store them. Those who have read "The Travels of Lao Ts'an" may remember the story of Lao Ts'an visiting Dongchang Prefecture to search for books; the place he wanted to visit was Haiyuan Pavilion. Liu Tieyun tried every possible means but could not enter this library, and could only lament that important classics were "all returned to Dongchang Prefecture, deeply locked in a treasure box to be devoured by bookworms," and left disappointed. The richness of the collection in the pavilion was the best among private collections in the north. Before the war, Song and Yuan editions were sold for so much silver per page or even per character. After the Republic of China, there was a proposal to make it public, but the descendants stole and hid many books. After years of occupation by the enemy and puppets, it is unknown how much damage has been done. It is truly unimaginable what it looks like now. It is hoped that the JiluYu Administrative Office can send someone to investigate and take care of it as soon as possible.

    As for Mr. Fu Sinian, he is a renowned historian, originally named Mengzhen, currently forty-eight years old, and a graduate of Peking University. During the May Fourth Movement, he was an active figure among students. He lived in the University of Berlin and the University of London. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Department of Arts and History at Guangzhou National Sun Yat-sen University. His outstanding research on ancient Chinese history led him to become a full-time researcher at the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, and later also served as the director. He was also a famous professor at Peking University. During the War of Resistance, he was a famous "artilleryman" in the National Political Council. He often criticized the corruption and bureaucratic capitalism of the Kuomintang, and he was even more forceful in attacking the Kong family. He visited Yan'an once in July of the year before last. After the victory, he temporarily served as the president of Peking University. When the Kuomintang's so-called "Purge Group" arrived in Beiping, he engaged in a fruitless war of words with the head of the group. Later, he handed over the presidency to Hu Shi and went to Nanjing to serve as the director of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica.

    海源阁傅斯年
    刘伯承将军部队元旦进入聊城。入城以前，就命令全军执行三件事：（一）向民族英雄范筑先将军墓立正致敬，（二）保护中国三大书库之一的海源阁。（三）妥为保护中国史学家傅斯年先生的住宅。这说明了人民军队是如何尊重民族英雄、民族文化及学者。但据本报前线记者报导，范将军墓虽屹然犹在。而傅先生住宅却被国民党的王金祥匪部毁做瓦砾堆。海源阁是否无恙，还不得而知呢！
    “海源阁”是个大藏书楼，清代聊城有一位杨以增，官做到河道总督。这人不爱别的，专好收藏书籍，先后收了几十万卷，盖了一座大楼来藏它，起名“海源阁”，出了一套《海源阁丛书》。到他儿子杨绍和，编写一了部《楹书隅录》，又搜了许多宋元版的好书，另盖一座“宋存室”来收藏。看过《老残游记》的，也许还记得老残到东昌府访书的故事，那所要访的，就是这海源阁。刘铁云想尽千方百计，没能进入这个书库，只好婉惜着重要典籍的“一齐归入东昌府，深锁琅函饱蠹鱼”，怏怏而去。阁中藏书之富，在北方私人藏书中要属第一。其中宋元版书，就在战前也是讲几多银元一页或一个字卖的。民国后，一度倡议归公，子孙们盗卖藏匿了不少。经过敌伪多年盘据，又不知损害几多，现在成个什么样子，真是不堪设想，希望冀鲁豫行署能从速派人清查保管一下。
    至于傅斯年先生，是闻名的一位历史学家，原名孟真，现年四十八岁，北京大学毕业。在五四时代，是学生里的一个活动人物。住过柏林大学和伦敦大学，回国以后，当过广州国立中山大学文史科的主任。对中国古代史的一些杰出的研究，使他成为中央研究院历史语言研究所的专任研究员，后来又兼任主任。同时也是北京大学的名教授。抗战后，在国民参政会的席上，是有名的一个炮手。常常对国民党的贪污腐化和官僚资本进行抨击，对孔家攻击得更出力。前年七月到过延安一次，胜利后暂代北京大学的校长，当国民党的所谓“清查团”到北平的时候，和该团团长打了一场没结果的笔墨官司，后来把校长交给代胡适，到南京任中央研究院历史语言研究所的所长去了。
