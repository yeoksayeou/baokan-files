    Shandong Military Region Launches Quick Clapperboard Movement
    The Shandong People's Liberation Army units are using the form of singing quick clapperboards to express the soldiers' lives, studies, and combat situations. This is a political work method that combines politics, culture, and entertainment into one. Because the quick clapperboard has rhymes, it is easy to recite and remember, and what it expresses is the soldiers' daily life. Therefore, after this movement was launched, soldiers cheerfully sang quick clapperboards whether during training, garrisoning, marching, or fighting. For example, before the recovery of Yixian and Zaozhuang, such quick clapperboards were popular among the soldiers:
    “Chiang Kai-shek, what a scoundrel!
    First he occupied my Taierzhuang,
    Then he occupied my Zaozhuang and Yixian.
    Comrades, work hard,
    Raise our fierce tiger power,
    Fight a few beautiful annihilation battles!”
    As for the organization, it is also very simple: the company clerk serves as the group leader, each squad selects a communication员 [liaison officer], everyone gets together when they have time, and then the company headquarters makes necessary corrections and it's done. The Political Department of the Shandong Military Region believes that this method is very suitable for the current and future mobile warfare environment, and has issued a call to the entire army to emulate and widely carry out the quick clapperboard movement.

### 山东军区展开快板运动

    山东军区展开快板运动
    山东解放军各部队用唱快板形式把战士们的生活学习和战斗等情形表现出来，这是使政治、文化、娱乐结合为一的政治工作方式。因为快板有韵脚，念起来顺口容易记会，而且所表现的都是战士们日常的生活，因此这一运动开展后，不论在整训、驻防、行军或作战时，战士们都愉快地唱着快板。比如在峄县、枣庄收复前战士中就流行着这样的快板：
    “蒋介石，真混蛋！
    先占我台儿庄，
    后占我枣庄和峄县。
    同志们努力干，
    振起咱们的猛虎威，
    打上几个漂亮的歼灭战！”
    至于组织也很简单：连队的文书担任组长，每班选一个通讯员，抽空大家一凑，再出连部加以必要修正就成了。山东军区政治部认为这种方式很适合于当前及今后的运动战环境，特号召全军效法，广泛开展快板运动。
