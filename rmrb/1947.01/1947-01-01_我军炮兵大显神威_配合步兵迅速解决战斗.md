    Cooperating with Infantry to Quickly Resolve Battle

    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th] During this Subei great annihilation battle, the New Fourth Army's artillery displayed great power. According to a report from frontline reporter Liu Liang: On the evening of the 17th, the New Fourth Army counterattacked the 57th Division of the Chiang Army's Advance 3rd Brigade headquarters and one of its regiments, which were trapped in Xiaodianzi (20 miles north of Suqian). As soon as the troops began to advance on the vast plains, the brave artillery immediately bombarded the Chiang Army's positions, suppressing the Chiang Army's firepower and accurately hitting the Chiang Army's fortifications. According to captured soldiers, when the New Fourth Army's artillery sounded, the Chiang Army's commanders at all levels hurriedly hid in the fortifications, not daring to show their faces, causing the soldiers to lose command and fall into a state of panic. The New Fourth Army soldiers, however, were a hundred times more excited by the accurate shooting of the artillery. Demolition teams cleared obstacles such as deer寨and barbed wire of the Chiang Army in three explosions. The Chiang Army, trapped in the fortifications, still mistook it for the huge sound of the New Fourth Army's mountain guns. In an instant, the New Fourth Army launched a sudden attack and rushed to the front of the Chiang Army's fortifications, and launched street fighting. The artillery immediately concentrated its bombardment on the Chiang Army's deep positions, inflicting heavy casualties and cooperating with the infantry to quickly resolve the battle. Afterwards, the captured Chiang Army officers and soldiers, when they talked about it, praised in unison: "Your (referring to the New Fourth Army) artillery fire is fierce and accurate, really powerful! Really powerful!"

    【新华社华中廿五日电】此次苏北大歼灭战中，新四军炮兵大显神威。据前线记者刘亮报导：十七日晚新四军反击困守晓店子（宿迁北二十里）之蒋军五十七师预三旅旅部及其一个团，当部队刚在广阔平原上向前运动时，神勇炮兵即向蒋军阵地猛轰，将蒋军火力压倒，并准确地击中蒋军工事目标。据俘虏兵谈，当新四军炮声大作时，蒋军各级指挥员即仓皇躲进工事，不敢出头露面，致士兵失去指挥，陷入慌乱状态。新四军战士却因炮兵的准确射击而兴奋百倍，爆炸手三次爆破，扫除蒋军鹿砦铁丝网等障碍物，困守工事中蒋军，犹以为新四军山炮弹之巨响。刹那间，新四军突击，队已冲至蒋军工事前，并展开巷战。炮兵立刻集中轰击蒋军纵深阵地，予以重大杀伤，配合步兵迅速解决战斗。事后，被俘蒋军官兵谈及时，同声赞佩说：“你们（指新四军）的炮火又猛又准，真厉害！真厉害！”
