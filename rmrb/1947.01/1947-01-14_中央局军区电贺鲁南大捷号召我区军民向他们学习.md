　　Central Bureau and Military Region Send Congratulations on the Lu Nan Victory, Calling on Our Region's Military and Civilians to Learn from Them
    To Comrade Chen Yi, forwarding to the Commanders and Fighters on the Lu Nan Front:
    The Lu Nan Victory at the beginning of the year created an unprecedented large-scale self-defense and annihilation battle result, smashing Chiang's attempt to open up the Jinpu Railway, divide Shandong and northern Jiangsu, and sever the connection between our JiluYu liberated areas, providing even more powerful support to the patriotic movements of the people in Ping, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai. It proves that traitorous reactionaries will inevitably collapse before the invincible power of the people, and the bright future of New China is getting closer and closer. We call on the military and civilians of all counties in our region to learn from you, to make persistent efforts, to cooperate in combat, and to bravely advance for the complete elimination of the reactionaries!
　　　The Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, JinjiLuyu
　　　        Military Region Headquarters, together with He Zihao

　　中央局军区电贺鲁南大捷号召我区军民向他们学习
    陈毅同志转鲁南前线指战员同志：
    献岁鲁南大捷，创造了空前的大规模自卫歼灭战果，粉碎蒋军妄图打通津浦分割山东、苏北及我冀鲁豫解放区的联系，更有力的支援平、津、京、沪人民爱国运动。证明了卖国贼反动派必然要在不可战胜的人民力量前面崩溃，新中国的光明前途愈加接近。我们号召我区各县军民向你们学习，愿再接再厉，配合作战，为彻底消灭反动派奋勇前进！
　　　晋冀鲁豫中共中央局
　　　        军区司令部同贺子皓
