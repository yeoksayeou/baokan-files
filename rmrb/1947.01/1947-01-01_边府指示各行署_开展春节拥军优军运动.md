The Border Region Government Directs All Administrative Offices to Launch Spring Festival Support-the-Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Military Families Campaign

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] On December 28th, the Border Region Government specially instructed all administrative offices to launch an unprecedentedly warm campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families during the period from the Lunar New Year to the Spring Festival. The original text of the instruction is as follows:

The Patriotic Self-Defense War since May is of great importance to defending the achievements of democratic construction in our region and the interests of the masses who have turned over a new leaf. Thanks to the wise leadership of Generals Liu and Deng, and the brave and arduous fighting of the soldiers, the entire region annihilated more than 110,000 enemies, achieving brilliant results. Although the war situation has begun to change, the reactionaries will inevitably struggle again. As the Spring Festival approaches, the whole region is jubilantly celebrating the year of victory. We should launch an unprecedentedly warm campaign to support the army, strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to military families, to boost morale and comfort their hard work.

The implementation of this work (from the Lunar New Year to the Spring Festival) must be closely integrated with winter schools, the mass movement to turn over a new leaf, and the work of leveling up and making up for deficiencies in production. In winter schools, we should focus on educating the masses to recognize that the Eighth Route Army, the Democratic National Construction Army, and the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army are the people's own army. The people's ability to turn over a new leaf and the protection of the fruits of that transformation are inextricably linked to the heroic fighting, bloodshed, and sacrifice of the soldiers on the front line. We must inspire everyone's enthusiasm for respecting and cherishing the army. Not only should we launch a major campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families this time, but we must also care for the lives of the army and their families at all times in the future, just as we care for our own lives. We must encourage our children or husbands to join the People's Liberation Army with the slogan "Joining the army is the most glorious," and regularly mobilize soldiers who have returned home to return to their units, striving to expand and consolidate the people's army. We must make the people deeply understand that cherishing the People's Liberation Army, giving preferential treatment to their families, and helping them solve various difficulties at any time and in any place are the unshirkable duties of our local governments and all the people. We must actively support the front line in various aspects, both spiritually and materially. We must reflect on and examine past shortcomings, and strive to earnestly improve our work in the future. Models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families should be commended to encourage others. The above content must also be implemented in the Spring Festival's cultural and entertainment activities. We must strengthen political education on supporting the army to further improve the understanding of the broad masses on this issue.

At present, because most of the soldiers are fighting fiercely with the Chiang Kai-shek army in the freezing cold, we first call on the people and government personnel of the entire region to be frugal, tighten their belts, step up production, and strengthen their work. We must use all our strength to supply the army and ensure supplies, so that the army can eat well and dress warmly. We must coordinate with the needs of the front line and do a good job in logistics. Other regions can organize comfort groups to rush to the front line to offer comfort, and widely encourage the masses, village cadres in areas concerned by the soldiers at the front, primary school teachers, and organizations to write comfort letters to the soldiers of the troops they know, reporting to them the enthusiastic and tense situation of the movement to turn over a new leaf, filling the gaps, and preparing for large-scale production. In particular, military families should be organized to write letters, cordially comforting their children or husbands, explaining the situation at home, and telling them to fight and learn to improve their skills at the front with peace of mind. We should mobilize the masses to offer good comfort to nearby troops, wounded soldiers' hospitals, sanatoriums, and veterans, and hold army-people get-togethers. We should properly entertain passing troops and earnestly help the army solve various specific problems. In short, we must make the broad masses deeply understand that the soldiers are the protectors of their vital interests, thereby consciously and willingly creating a climax of supporting the army. We must vigorously guard against formalism of forced orders that do not open up the minds of the masses.

Secondly, in terms of giving preferential treatment to military families, we should mainly emphasize its regularity and the practical solution of actual difficulties, and oppose the attitude of indifference or perfunctory work. We must accurately understand the different economic and labor conditions of the families of martyrs and military families, and provide specific assistance. We must provide what they need, focusing in particular on helping them establish their families, develop agriculture, handicrafts, sideline occupations, and other productions, and establish self-reliant economic conditions, gradually achieving sufficiency in food and clothing. We must provide reasonable adjustments and appropriate care in filling the gaps for those who did not receive sufficient care or were unfairly distributed the fruits of the revolution. The issue of substitute farming should be resolved reasonably in conjunction with the large-scale production movement. Martyrs' families, military families, veterans, the old, the weak, and the demobilized who have labor or semi-labor forces should be organized as much as possible to engage in various productions, without the need for substitute farming or only substitute farming for part of it. Those who are truly lacking in labor and unable to make a living should be well organized for substitute farming, and appropriate care must be given to the old, the weak, and the demobilized. In the past, various localities have provided relatively poor assistance to them. Some villages have too many martyrs' families, military families, veterans, the old, the weak, and the demobilized, feeling an excessively heavy burden. Counties and districts—and when necessary, special districts—should be used as units to make adjustments and balance the burden of financial and labor resources, so that some villages are not overburdened, affecting the production mood of the masses.

In order to achieve the goal of effectively improving the preferential treatment of military families, it is proposed that each administrative office and each special district and county should go deep into several villages to inspect the actual situation of this work, what problems exist, and what deviations there are. We must collect good and bad typical materials, seriously study improvement methods, carry forward the good traditions of past years' work, and resolutely correct the shortcomings. We must oppose the old routine of some areas that do not solve practical problems and lack creativity, and simply cope with the task every year. We must know that doing a good job in giving preferential treatment to military families can not only greatly boost morale and guarantee the victory of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, but also play a significant role in disintegrating the Chiang Kai-shek army that has invaded the liberated areas. We must have sufficient understanding of this. We hope you will promptly instruct your subordinates to carry out this work earnestly and make greater achievements.

　　边府指示各行署
    开展春节拥军优军运动
    【本报特讯】边府于十二月二十八日特指示各行署在旧历年关至春节开展空前热烈的拥护军队优待军属运动，指示原文如下：
    五月来的爱国自卫战争，对保卫本区民主建设成果，群众翻身利益关系至大，由于刘、邓诸将军英明领导，将士英勇艰苦作战。全区歼敌十一万以上，战果辉煌，目前战局虽已开始变动，但反动派必仍作再度挣扎。当兹春节来临，全区欢欣鼓舞，庆祝胜利年之际，我们应开展一个空前热烈的拥军运动，加强优待军属工作，以利士气，而慰辛劳。
    进行这一工作（旧历年关到春节）须密切与冬学，群众翻身填平补齐大生产等工作结合，在冬学中，应着重教育群众认识八路军、民主建国军、西北民主联军三十八军是人民自己的军队。人民之能翻身以及翻身果实的保卫与前线将士的英勇作战，流血牺牲有血肉不可分的关系。激发大家尊重爱护军队的热情，不仅这次要掀起一个拥护军队优待军属的大运动，就在今后任何时候都必须关心军队及其家属的生活，像关心自己的生活一样。要以“参军最光荣”劝勉自己的子弟或丈夫去参加人民子弟兵，并经常动员回家战士归队，为扩大与巩固人民的军队而努力。要使人民深切理解爱护子弟兵，优待其家属，随时随地帮助解决各种困难，乃是我们地方政府，一切人民义不容辞的天职。要从精神物质多方面去积极支援前线。反省检查过去缺点，力求在今后工作中认真改进，对拥护军队优待军属的模范应予表扬，以推动其他。在春节的文化娱乐中亦须贯彻上述内容。加强拥军政治教育。使广大群众对此问题的认识更提高一步。
    在目前，因大部子弟兵均在冰天雪地中与蒋军奋战，我们首先号召全区人民与政府人员要节衣缩食，加紧生产，加强工作，用一切力量供应军队保证供给，使军队能吃饱穿暖，务要配合前线需要做好后勤工作，其他各区可组织慰劳团，赶往前线慰劳，并广泛推动群众与前方战士所关心地区的村干部、小学教员、机关团体，给自己所认识的部队战士写慰劳信，把翻身运动，填平补齐，准备大生产的热烈紧张情形报告他们。特别要组织军属写信，亲切安慰自己的子弟或丈夫。说明家中时光，叫他们安心在前方打仗，学习提高技术。对附近驻军，伤兵医院休养所荣誉军人等应很好发动群众进行慰劳，召开军民联欢会。对过往军队，要妥善招待切实帮助军队解决各种具体问题。总之，务使广大人民深切领会子弟兵是他们切身利益的保卫者，由此自觉自愿的造成拥军高潮。须力戒不打通群众思想的强迫命令的形式主义。
    其次，优待军属方面，主要应强调其经常性与切实解决实际困难问题，反对漠不关心或应付公事的态度。必须确切了解烈属军属经济情况与劳力情况之不同，给予具体帮助，需要什么帮助什么，特别着重帮助他们建立家务，发展农业手工业副业等等生产，树立自力更生的经济条件，逐渐达到衣食丰足，翻身运动中照顾不够或分配果实不公的必须在填平补齐时予以合理的调剂与适当照顾。代耕问题，应结合大生产运动，求得合理解决。烈属军属，荣誉军人，老弱退伍人员有劳力或半劳力者应尽量组织起来，从事各种生产，无须代耕或只代耕一部。真正缺乏劳力无以为生的应很好组织代耕，其中对老弱退伍者亦必须予以适当照顾，因过去各地对他们帮助是比较差的。有些村庄烈属、军属、荣誉军人，老弱退伍人员数字过太集中太多，感觉负担畸重者，应以县区——必要时以专区为单位，加以调整，平衡财力劳力负担，使一部分村庄不致负担过重，影响群众生产情绪。
    为达切实改进优待军属之目的，提议各行署，各专、县均应深入若干村庄，检查此一工作进行实际情况，究竟存在些什么问题，有什么偏向，搜集好坏典型材料认真研究改进办法，历年工作中好的传统，应予发扬，缺点必须坚决纠正。反对某些地区不解决实际问题，缺乏创造性，每年照例应付一遍的老一套作风。须知优待军属工作做得好，不仅可以大大鼓舞士气，保证爱国自卫战争的胜利，对于瓦解侵入解放区的蒋介石军队亦将起很大作用，我们对此必须有足够的认识。希迅即指示所属认真进行，把这一工作做出更大成绩来。
