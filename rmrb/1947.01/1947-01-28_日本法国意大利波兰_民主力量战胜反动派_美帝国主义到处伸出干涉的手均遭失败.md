    Democratic Forces Triumph Over Reactionaries in Japan, France, Italy, and Poland
    US Imperialism Fails in its Attempts to Interfere Everywhere
    In the past week, intense political struggles have unfolded in Japan, France, Italy, and Poland.
    In Japan, the movement to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet continues to grow. A massive demonstration of 500,000 people in Tokyo demanding the cabinet's resignation is scheduled for January 28th. A general strike involving 2.7 million people is also set to begin on February 1st. The fact that the Japanese people, particularly the Japanese working class, have been able to launch such a strike within a short period of a year and a half after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, under the rule of the MacArthur authorities and their support for reactionary forces, demonstrates the high degree and rapid development of the Japanese people's awareness and unity. The MacArthur authorities recently attempted to interfere in this general strike under the guise of mediators. Japanese reactionaries also attempted to thwart the outbreak of the strike through the bloody means of assassinating workers' leader Katsumi Kikunami, but both attempts failed. The crisis of the Yoshida Cabinet is growing.
    In France, after several days of negotiations and struggles, the first official French government has been formed. The French Communist Party (PCF), as it did in supporting the Socialist candidate for president in the previous week, supported the Socialist Ramadier's plan to form a cabinet. The PCF obtained important positions such as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense. The PCF also supported the Radical Party's candidate, Herriot, for President of the National Assembly, which completely foiled the right-wing's plan to delay the deadlock and exclude and isolate the PCF. The French political situation will continue to involve complex struggles in the future, but the PCF, with its deep-rooted strength and prestige, as well as its flexible struggle tactics, will surely remain invincible.
    In Italy, after Christian Democratic leader Gasperi returned from Washington with a $100 million loan, a cabinet crisis quickly erupted. Right-wing elements attempted to take advantage of this favorable condition to attack the left, refusing to allow the Communist Party and the Socialist Party into the government. Gasperi himself issued an anti-communist statement upon resigning. The composition of the new cabinet is currently being considered. However, the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party have become indispensable forces in resolving any important issues, and the reactionaries' plans are destined to fail.
    In Poland, the general election was held on the 19th. This was the last general election to be held among the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. The interference of the US and Britain in this election was particularly vigorous, with three notes being issued in succession, but all were rejected by the Polish democratic government, which adheres to an independent and autonomous policy! The various conspiracies and sabotage instigated by domestic reactionaries in Poland, including the organization of armed assassinations, have also failed to prevent the Polish people from aspiring to democracy and peace. The results of the general election show that the Democratic Bloc has won an overwhelming victory, with recent statistics showing that it has won 382 out of 444 seats.
    From the political situations in Japan, France, Italy, and Poland above, it can be seen that the reactionaries in various countries are doing everything possible to suppress independence and hinder the development of the democratic movement, using all sorts of tricks. US imperialist elements are extending their interfering hands everywhere, but in the final analysis, after winding and tortuous roads, the democratic forces in various countries are steadily advancing.

### 日本法国意大利波兰  民主力量战胜反动派  美帝国主义到处伸出干涉的手均遭失败

    日本法国意大利波兰
    民主力量战胜反动派
    美帝国主义到处伸出干涉的手均遭失败
    过去一周中，日本、法国、意大利、波兰等国政局发生激烈的斗争。
    在日本，反对吉田内阁的倒阁运动继续增长，东京五十万人的倒阁大示威，将于本月二十八日举行。二百七十万人的总罢工，亦将于二月一日开始。日本人民，特别是日本工人阶级，在日寇投降后一年又半的短短时期内，在麦克阿瑟当局统治与扶持反动势力的情形下，能发动这样的罢工，这说明日本人民觉悟与团结的程度之高速度的发展。麦克阿瑟当局近又企图以调停者的面目来干涉此次总罢工，日反动派亦想以行刺工人领袖菊浪胜三的血腥手段，来阻扰这次罢工的爆发，均告失败。吉田内阁危机，正增长中。
    在法国，经数天的谈判斗争，法国首届正式政府已组成，法共如像前周支持社会党总统候选人一样，支持了社会党拉马第的组阁计划。而法共则获得副总理，及国防部长等重要职位。法共又支持了急进党的候选人赫里欧任国民议会议长，这就使右派企图拖延僵局，排挤及孤立法共的计划破产无遗。法国政局今后仍有复杂的斗争，但法共以其根深蒂固的力量与威望，以及灵活的斗争策略，必将立于不败之地。
    在意大利，当基督教民主党领袖加斯贝利从华府挟一万万美元贷款归来之后，迅即发生阁潮，右派分子企图借此有利条件而向左派进攻，拒共产党与社会党于政府门外，加斯贝利本人亦于辞职时发表反共声明，新阁成份现正酝酿中。但意共与社会党已成为解决任何重要问题，不可缺少的力量，反动派的打算，势非失败不可。
    在波兰，大选已于十九日举行，这是东欧各新民主主义国家中最后举行的一次大选。美英对这次大选的干涉，来得特别起劲，一连发出了三道照会，但均为一本独立自主政策的波兰民主政府拒绝了！波兰国内反动派所策动的各种阴谋破坏，以至组织武装暗杀，亦未能阻挠波兰人民向往民主和平的意愿。大选结果，民主党派联盟获压倒胜利，最近统计已在四四四席中占三八二席。
    从以上日、法、意、波四国政局中可以看见各国反动派为着打击独立，阻挠民主运动发展，千方百计，花样多端。美帝国主义分子，到处伸出干涉之手，但归根到底，经过迂回曲折的道路，各国民主势力，稳步向前。（新华社延安二十六日电）
