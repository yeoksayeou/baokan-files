Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 27th: The Liberation Daily published an editorial entitled "Dig Up the Roots of Poverty, Plant the Roots of Wealth," calling for the launch of spring ploughing and production. The editorial stated that this year's spring ploughing and production is a crucial key for the military and civilians in the liberated areas to overcome difficulties, plan for the long term, and welcome victory. Party, government, military, and civilians in the liberated areas, especially those in charge of various departments, should, in addition to continuing to better lead and carry out the intense war of self-defense, regard leading and carrying out spring ploughing as the central link in their work. Any phenomena such as using the excuse of tense self-defense mobilization, not having time to take care of production, or thinking that farmers will engage in production themselves after being allocated land, thereby relaxing leadership over spring ploughing and letting it develop spontaneously, should be overcome. As for some comrades who entered the cities after Japan surrendered last year, coupled with "making peace," and thus looked down on or even forgot about labor production, that should be corrected even more. The editorial further pointed out that in order to make spring ploughing truly become a vigorous movement of the broad masses, it is first necessary to strive to complete land reform before spring ploughing. This is the key to whether spring ploughing and production can be carried out well. Secondly, it is necessary to help farmers solve many specific difficulties in developing production. Farmers' associations and cooperatives should be good at helping farmers utilize agricultural loans, properly regulate seeds and farm tools, and mobilize joint purchases and raising of livestock. When conditions permit, it is necessary to continue to organize farmers to engage in sideline production, especially transportation and weaving, which is quick and profitable. Thirdly, use the greatest effort to organize labor and save labor in order to overcome the difficulties of a certain degree of labor shortage that has occurred in some areas due to the eight-year War of Resistance and self-defense mobilization. In the central areas, it is especially necessary to promote the combination of logistics and production, fully develop the labor exchange between production and logistics, and appropriately regulate labor, so as to ensure that there are people to support the front line without delaying production. In guerrilla areas and border areas, it is necessary to better organize the combination of military and labor, with militia guerrillas and production masses exchanging labor to carry out guerrilla activities and protect the rear production. Cadres and activists who have emerged from the land reform movement should continue to personally participate in and lead the masses in organizing mutual aid in production with the same enthusiasm as leading the emancipation movement. In addition, on the basis of women's joint participation in land reform and family democracy and harmony, mobilize the broad masses of women to actively participate in production, engage in auxiliary labor and sideline occupations. Fourthly, all troops and organizations in the rear should engage in production. Frontline combat troops should focus their main attention on saving civilian labor. Some troops and organizations organize production teams or production groups in the rear to engage in production, but in reality, they use compulsory labor to mobilize the masses, which is not only not beneficial to production but also harmful to the unity between the army and the people and should be prevented. The editorial concluded by saying that the central task of this year's spring ploughing and production is to increase grain production, ensure sufficient military and civilian food supplies, and with closer integration with the masses, the victory of the war of self-defense will have a reliable guarantee.

    解放日报社论号召
    准备开展春耕生产
    完成土地改革是开展生产的关键
    战斗部队应该特别注意节约民力
    【新华社延安二十七日电】解放日报以“挖了穷根，安下富根”为题，发表社论，号召开展春耕生产，该社论首称：今年的春耕生产，是解放区军民克服困难，长远打算，迎接胜利的重要关键。解放区党政军民，首先是各部门负责人，除继续更好的领导与进行紧张的自卫战争外。应以领导与进行春耕作为自己工作的中心环节。任何借口自卫动员紧张，无暇照顾生产，或者以为农民既经分得土地，自己会闹生产，以致放松对春耕的领导，任其自发自流的现象，都应该克服。至于去年日本投降以后，一部分同志进了城市，再加上“闹和平”，因而看轻甚至忘掉了劳动生产，那就更应该纠正。社论继指出：为了使春耕真正成为广大群众的蓬蓬勃勃的运动，首先必须尽力争取在春耕以前完成土地改革，这是春耕生产能否很好开展的关键。其次必须帮助农民解决发展生产的许多具体困难，农会和合作社要善于帮助农民利用农贷，很好调剂种籽、农具，发动合伙购买和喂养牲口。在条件许可时，要继续组织农民进行副业生产，尤其是运输和纺织，获利快而且大。第三、用最大功夫组织劳力，和节省劳力，以克服若干地区由于八年抗战和自卫动员而发生的一定程度的劳力不足的困难。在中心区，特别要提倡后勤与生产结合，充分发展生产与后勤的变工，适当调剂劳动，做到既有人支应前线，又不耽误生产。在游击区和边沿区，要更好的组织劳武结合，民兵游击队与生产群众变工进行游击活动，掩护后方生产。从土地改革运动中涌现出来的干部和积极分子，应该以领导翻身运动的同样热情，在生产中继续亲自动手，领导群众，组织生产互助。此外在男女共同参加土地改革与家庭民主和睦的基础上，动员广大妇女积极参加生产，持辅助劳动与副业。第四、凡是在后方的部队、机关，都应进行生产。前线作战部队，则应把主要的注意力放在节省民力上面。有些部队机关在后方组织生产队或生产小组，搞生产，实际上却用支差方式动员群众劳动，这不但于生产无益，而且有害于军民的团结，应该防止。该社论最后称：今年春耕生产的中心任务是增产粮食，保障充足的军需民食，加上与群众更密切的结合，自卫战争的胜利就有了可靠的保障。
