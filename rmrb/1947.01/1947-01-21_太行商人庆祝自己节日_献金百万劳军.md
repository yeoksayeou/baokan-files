Taihang Merchants Celebrate Their Own Festival
Donate a Million to Comfort the Troops

[This newspaper reported] Taihang's Changzhi, Wu'an, Shexian and other twelve counties and cities merchants, respectively, gathered on the 25th of last month to commemorate the Merchants' Festival. Taihang's major market towns of Suobao, Henandian, Duncun, Xiying, Rencun and other places merchants were decorated with lanterns and flags, and organized Yangko dances to promote current events to celebrate. The merchants recalled the pain of the past enemy and puppet rule, compared with the situation in the Chiang-controlled areas where US goods and the monopoly of the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen undermined and devastated industry and commerce, feeling deeply grateful to enjoy the liberated areas' free trade and the government's policy of supporting industry and commerce. In order to thank the Eighth Route Army for their arduous battles to protect their business, they proposed: "When drinking water, don't forget those who dug the well." They launched a donation movement to support the front lines. Wu'an Yangyi merchants immediately donated 500,000 yuan, a total of twelve counties and cities donated a total of one million yuan, and countless pigs, sheep, and daily necessities. Zheng Shiqing, a small restaurant merchant in Lingchuan, said: "Two years ago, traitors and devils ate without paying, and we businessmen were losing money, but now we have turned over, and we can't let old Chiang come and harm us again." Barber Wang Shuangxi said: "When the enemy was here, we shaved their heads for nothing. Today, the government has helped us earn money, and we must protect this good time and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's attack!" Changzhi merchants unanimously proposed: "Without the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, there would be no Merchants' Festival today. We must strengthen our organization, develop our business, support the front lines, and avenge the Shanghai hawkers in distress." Hukuan merchants summarized their work on the festival, and the experience of Feng Zixiang, manager of Dianshang Zhixingcheng, clarified the path to making money by serving the masses. Merchants in various places are widely promoting and implementing the movement to resist American goods and buy and sell local goods, facing the countryside and serving the people.

　　太行商人庆祝自己节日
    献金百万劳军
    【本报讯】太行长治、武安、涉县等十二县市商人，分别于上月二十五日集会纪念商人节。太行各大集镇索堡、河南店、段村、西营、任村等地商人均结彩悬旗，并组织秧歌宣传时事以庆祝。商人们回想过去敌伪统治时期之痛苦，比比蒋管区由于美货及蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族之垄断摧残，工商业濒于总崩溃之情形，深感得以享受解放区自由贸易及政府扶助工商业政策之幸福。为感谢八路军之艰苦作战保卫自己营业，纷纷提出：“吃水不忘掏井人。”掀起献金支援前线运动。武安阳邑商人即献金五十万元，合计十二县市共献金百万元，及猪、羊、日用品无数。陵川小饭铺商人郑士卿说：“前两年汉奸鬼子吃饭不掏钱，咱作买卖光赔本，如今翻了身，可不能再让老蒋来害咱了。”剃头工人王双喜说：“敌人在时，给他们剃头是白剃，今天政府帮助咱们赚了钱，咱一定要保住这好时光，打退蒋介石进攻！”长治商人一致提出：“没有共产党八路军就没有今天的商人节，我们要加强组织，发展业务，支援前线，为上海被难摊贩复仇。”壶关商人于节日总结工作，以店上志兴成经理冯子祥经验明确了为群众服务就能赚钱的道路。各地商人正广泛地推行与贯彻抵制美货及买卖土货，面向农村为民服务的运动。
