Central Bureau's Instructions on Mass Guerrilla Warfare
    Summarizing Six Months of Basic Experience and Pointing Out Future Tasks.
    In the past six months of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, our entire region has implemented the policy of boldly launching guerrilla warfare in the border areas of the occupied areas and has achieved considerable success. Local military groups, guerrilla teams, and militias have eliminated more than 50,000 enemies (the ratio of enemies eliminated by local forces to the field army is about 6 to 5), containing 30 brigades of the Chiang army. Although the Chiang army occupied 30 of our county towns, the vast rural areas are still under our control; the chaotic situation at the beginning of the war has basically stopped, and the situation in four-fifths of the occupied areas has been opened up, and new developments have occurred in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu; some areas overcame peaceful illusions relatively early, prepared before the Chiang army invaded, and implemented the policy of relying on the masses in any situation, closely linking with the masses and integrating with the masses, implemented the policy of internal unity within the party by uniting all local cadres and mass leaders, and implemented the policy of boldly launching guerrilla warfare, fighting bravely, and disregarding sacrifices against the enemy. Therefore, they can always hold their positions and protect the interests of the masses; this is worthy of reward. Some areas had a higher degree of peaceful illusions, especially a few places that moved the focus of their work from rural areas to cities after the counter-offensive, taking cities as the center, abandoning the rural base areas, and became paralyzed in war preparation. When the Chiang army invaded, there was a period of chaos; in addition, a few areas overestimated the social foundation and combat effectiveness of the Chiang army, and when the Chiang army invaded, they abandoned the masses and retreated and fled, losing their positions. This is a very bad phenomenon and should be overcome.
    Six months of experience have proven that wherever the Central Committee's May 4th Instructions can be resolutely implemented, land reform can be implemented, and peasants can be mobilized, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the emancipated peasants is very high, they can wage a resolute struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, and guerrilla warfare can be rapidly developed.
    Six months of experience have also proven that wherever cadres can closely contact the masses, rely on the masses, share life and death with the masses, and implement the unity policy of uniting outside cadres with local cadres, infinite strength can be generated; even if the initial armed force is very small, it can persist and develop. The method of relying solely on outside cadres and outside armed forces to enter and open up the world, even if the initial armed force is very large, will gradually shrink and even collapse.
    Six months of experience have also proven that whoever can deeply conduct current affairs education, respond to the call of the Central Committee, fight bravely, and not hesitate to sacrifice, and take out the strength accumulated during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War to wage a resolute struggle with the enemy, not to preserve strength, but to use the strength, not afraid of failure, try every means, and according to the specific circumstances, timely dispersion, concentration, and transfer, to achieve the goal of persistence. Guerrilla warfare can be sustained for a long time in areas that adopt the policy of the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance.
    Six months of experience have also proven that whoever can quickly overcome the illusions of peace with the U.S.-Chiang alliance and the idea of waiting for the main force to conquer the world, and confirm that the revolution must shed blood and sacrifice, and that a gun, a bullet, and an inch of land cannot be obtained by luck, and have ideological and organizational preparations for this, will not be flustered when the war comes. The so-called preparation is mainly to transform the peaceful organizational methods and lifestyles into wartime organizational methods and lifestyles, everything is wartime, and everything is for defeating Chiang Kai-shek. The phenomenon of using "ideological solutions" as an excuse, emphasizing the individual, and disobeying Party discipline must be stopped. At present, unifying thinking is all for winning the victory of the self-defense war. No bargaining is allowed, and endless discussions of non-urgent things are prohibited. It is necessary to obey the organization and abide by discipline. When peaceful illusions occurred within the Party and in the short half-year after entering the city, some cadres developed the hedonistic and decadent thoughts of landlords and the bourgeoisie, and in order to satisfy their own demands, they frequently used retirement from the army and the Party to blackmail the Party, and other bad phenomena. The leading organs should not be afraid of these cadres clamoring about insufficient criticism and care, and criticizing bureaucratism; this kind of tendency must be resolutely corrected. We should emphasize hard struggle and heroic sacrifice. The faster we overcome the above tendencies, the faster we can develop the struggle against the enemy.
    Six months of experience have also proven that whoever can correctly analyze the current situation ideologically, point out the conditions for the Chiang army's inevitable defeat and our army's inevitable victory, and the prospects for victory, can persist on the spot and rapidly develop guerrilla warfare. We did not have a universal understanding of the shrinking social foundation of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the situation of being deserted by all. Because the Chiang army raped and plundered everywhere, especially Chiang Kai-shek implemented the policy of selling the country, dictatorship, and civil war, arousing the indignation of the broad masses. And we have implemented the land reform policy that fully meets the requirements of the peasants and are conducting a just self-defense war. Therefore, except for the despotic bullies, traitors, and stubborn landlords, the general landlords and rich peasants have also changed their original ideas of changing the world, willing to compromise with the peasants, jointly oppose the Kuomintang with the broad masses, support our Party's propositions, and believe that we will definitely win. The Kuomintang proposed the "reverse settlement movement," but they calculated secretly and declared their willingness to cooperate with us to the end. This change must be recognized.
    Six months of experience have also proven that whoever can correctly implement the lenient policy, but not unilateral leniency, resolutely suppressing the heinous despotic landlords, traitors, and those who shoot black guns, resolutely suppressing the ringleaders of the "Returning Home Corps" and "Revenge Team," etc., and allowing the coerced and affiliated elements to repent and start anew, without investigating the past. In this way, we can deprive the Kuomintang reactionaries of their claws and teeth, we can win over the majority and isolate the minority, and facilitate the development of guerrilla warfare.
    The next six months to one year will be a period of unprecedented tension in our struggle and increasingly close to the victory of the counter-offensive. Developing guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, adjacent areas, and even the Chiang-controlled areas, and accumulating strength to prepare for the counter-offensive and recovery of lost territory, is an important task of the Party in the guerrilla areas and occupied areas. The situation in most of the occupied areas in our region has been opened up and we have gained a foothold. However, it has not yet become consolidated, and the seesaw-like struggle will continue for a period of time. We should strive to consolidate it. The Party committees and military regions of each district must lead this struggle with the greatest strength.
    The most important task of the Party in the occupied areas is to lead the broad masses to wage a resolute struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, oppose the reversal of settlements, oppose conscription, protect the lives and property of the people, boldly mobilize the masses, and conduct guerrilla warfare. In order to implement this task, we should advocate heroic struggle, not hesitate to sacrifice, resolutely and actively attack the enemy, never bow our heads, and not be afraid of temporary setbacks and losses. Today is not about preserving strength and hiding for a long time, but about using all our strength to boldly launch guerrilla warfare. We must have the determination to sacrifice the local to achieve overall victory. Cadres of all levels of leading organs should closely contact the masses and persist in the local area, and must not flee to various places, otherwise they will be punished for violating discipline.
    We must closely contact the masses and rely on the masses. In order to strengthen the struggle against the enemy and widely develop guerrilla warfare, we should implement unified leadership, establish county, district, and village command posts, with the county head serving as the captain and the county secretary serving as the political commissar (the same applies to the district), with both office and power. Each detached guerrilla team (same as the armed work team) should also have various personnel from the Party, government, military, and people, an all-inclusive organization, so that they can carry out various tasks wherever they go. This is one of the basic conditions for victory.
    Resolutely suppress the masterminds of the reversal of settlements, resolutely crack down on the "Returning Home Corps," "Settlement Reversal Teams," "Revenge Teams," and all reactionary armed forces, thoroughly liquidate their crimes, and take various methods. When the enemy advances, we advance; when the enemy does not advance, we also advance; concentrate superior forces to annihilate the "Returning Home Corps," disperse forces to mobilize the masses to capture spies, etc. For those who are guilty of heinous crimes, they will be executed after a public trial by the masses; those who are coerced and affiliated with the enemy will also be treated as war criminals, implementing the policy of washing their faces and wiping them black, admitting their mistakes to the masses, withdrawing from the fruits of the reversal of settlements, issuing continuous guarantees, and allowing them to atone for their crimes; those militiamen and village cadres who have defected to the enemy, if they are determined to turn back and perform meritorious service for the people, will be allowed to atone for their crimes, and if they can carry out revolutionary work on the enemy's side and bring back their guns, they will be allowed to offset their crimes with their merits.
    Everything is for protecting the interests of the masses and performing meritorious service for the people. Always remember that the occupied areas were originally and will still be our base areas. We must cherish them and never regard them as Chiang-controlled areas or "colonies." The phenomenon of grabbing a handful must be prohibited. The troops and cadres who once left the masses and retreated and fled when the Chiang army attacked are letting the people down. We should resolutely fight back, apologize to the masses, and strive to launch guerrilla warfare to establish meritorious service in the local area; rebuild the flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses. We must ensure good mass discipline and respect local leaders and cadres, and cooperate with them in any situation. Call on the militiamen, local military groups, guerrilla teams, and local cadres to perform meritorious service for the people and carry out the meritorious service movement. Special commendation and rewards should be given to outstanding cadres and mass leaders who have persisted in the struggle on the border for a long time; severe punishment must be given to those who retreat and flee.
    Continue to implement land reform, protect the masses' vested interests, repel the reversal of settlements, and strive to get the middle and small landlords who are law-abiding to return home and take care of them. The general policy of land reform in the occupied areas and border areas should be to concentrate forces to strike at the big and bad ones, and the striking area should be narrow and the benefiting area should be wide. In terms of method, it should be quick to fight and quick to divide, divide as you fight, and it should be closely combined with the armed struggle against the reversal of settlements. The Kuomintang's deceptive and appeasing policies, such as saying that "the land that has been divided will not be changed, as long as you hand over the names of three people (director of the farmers' association, director of the military committee, and political director)," etc., should be exposed with facts at any time. This is just the enemy's arbitrary propaganda and conspiracy.
    Organize the masses in the occupied areas to produce. Production in the occupied areas has stagnated, increasing the difficulty of our persistence in the struggle. Although the Chiang army has been largely driven out in some areas, our larger troops cannot operate because there is no food to eat. Learning this lesson, we should always pay attention to stabilizing the emotions of the masses and carry out production, especially organizing the masses for spring plowing, to support the long-term struggle. In organizing production, pay attention to the combination of labor and military affairs, and combine the organization of mutual aid labor with the struggle against corvée labor, conscription, and looting. Relief for refugees should be carried out through the organization of production.
    Strengthen guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas and border areas, and prepare for the counter-offensive to recover lost territory. As long as we closely rely on the masses, persist in long-term struggle, and correctly implement the Party's policies, we will surely win!

    中央局关于群众游击战争的指示
    总结半年的基本经验，指出今后的斗争任务。
    在过去半年爱国自卫战争中，我全区在沦陷区边沿区执行放手发动游击战争的方针，获得不少成绩，地方兵团游击队及民兵共歼敌五万以上（与野战军歼敌数约为六与五之比），牵制蒋军三十个旅。蒋军虽占我三十个县城，但广大乡村仍为我所控制；战争开始时的混乱现象已基本停止，五分之四的沦陷区已打开局面，豫皖苏还有新的开展；某些地区曾因克服和平幻想较早，在蒋军未进攻前即有准备，实行了在任何情况下均依靠群众，紧密联系群众与群众融成一片的政策，实行了团结所有地方干部和群众领袖的党内团结政策，及放手发动游击战争英勇奋斗不顾牺牲的对敌斗争政策，故能始终坚持阵地，保护群众利益；这是值得奖励的。某些地区曾对和平幻想较高，特别有少数地方在反攻后把工作重心从农村搬到城市，以城市为中心，丢开了农村根据地，对战争准备麻痹，蒋军进犯时曾一度呈现混乱；还有少数地区，对蒋军社会基础及战斗力估计过高过严重，蒋军进犯时，即抛弃群众退却逃跑，丧失阵地，这是极坏现象，应力求克服。
    半年经验证明，凡能坚决执行中央五四指示，实行土地改革，发动农民的地区，翻身农民革命热情即很高，即能与国民党反动派进行坚决斗争，游击战争即能迅速开展。
    半年经验又证明，凡干部能紧密联系群众，依靠群众，与群众生死与共，实行外来干部团结本地干部的团结政策的地区，即可发生无比力量；即使开始武装很小，亦能坚持发展。单靠外来干部和外来武装打入开辟天下的办法，即使开始武装很大，亦会日益缩小以至垮台。
    半年经验又证明，凡时事教育深入响应中央号召英勇奋斗，不惜牺牲，而把八年抗战所积蓄起来的力量拿出来与敌人进行坚决斗争，不是保存力量，而是把力量使用出来，不怕失败，想尽一切办法，根据具体情况，适时的分散、集中、转移，达到坚持的目的。采取敌进我进，敌不进我亦进的方针的地区，游击战争均能长期坚持。
    半年经验又证明，凡能迅速克服对美蒋和平幻想及等待主力打天下的观点，确认革命必须流血牺牲，一枪一弹、尺寸土地均不可能侥幸获得，对此有思想和组织准备者，战争到来后，则不致张慌失措。所谓准备，主要是将和平的组织方式、生活方式转变为战争的组织方式、生活方式，一切战时化，一切为着打败蒋介石。借口“思想解决”，强调个人，不服从党的纪律的现象必须停止。目前，打通思想，就是一切为了争取自卫战争的胜利。不准讨价还价，禁止无休止的谈论不急要的东西，必须服从组织遵守纪律。当党内发生和平幻想和在进入城市后的短短半年中，某些干部中滋长了地主资产阶级的享乐主义、蜕化思想，为了满足自己的要求，动辄用退伍退党向党要挟等恶劣现象，领导机关不要怕这些干部叫嚣批评照顾不够，批评官僚主义；对此种倾向必须坚决纠正。应强调艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲，对以上倾向克服的愈快，即愈能迅速的开展对敌斗争。
    半年经验又证明，凡能在思想上正确分析时事，指出蒋军必败我军必胜的条件和胜利前途者，即能就地坚持迅速开展游击战争。国民党反动派社会基础缩小、众叛亲离的情况，我们在事先普遍认识不够。由于蒋军到处奸淫掠夺，特别是蒋介石实行卖国独裁内战政策，激起广大群众义愤。而我们实行了完全合乎农民要求的土地改革政策及进行了并进行着正义的自卫战争。因此，除恶霸汉奸顽固地主外，一般地主富农也改变了原来的变天思想，愿与农民妥协，和广大群众共同反对国民党，拥护我党主张，相信我们一定胜利。国民党提出“倒算运动”，他们则明算暗不算，声明愿与我们合作到底。这个变化必须认识。
    半年经验又证明，凡能正确执行宽大政策，而不是片面宽大，对罪大恶极的恶霸地主汉奸及打黑枪分子坚决给予镇压，对还乡团、复仇队等首要分子坚决给予镇压，对胁从分子和附和分子准予悔过自新，不究既往。如此，即能使国民党反动派失掉爪牙，我们即能争取多数、孤立少数，便利开展游击战争。
    今后半年至一年将是我们斗争空前紧张和日益接近反攻胜利的时期，开展沦陷区、接敌区、甚至蒋管区的游击战争，积蓄力量为反攻收复失地作准备，是党在游击区沦陷区的重要任务。我区沦陷区大部已找开局面，站住脚。然尚未臻巩固，拉锯式的斗争还会继续一个时期，应力争巩固起来。各区党委各军区须以最大力量，领导这一斗争。
    党在沦陷区最主要的任务，是领导广大群众与国民党反动派作坚决斗争，反倒算、反抓丁，保卫人民生命财产，放手发动群众，进行游击战争。为贯彻这一任务，应提倡英勇奋斗、不惜牺牲、坚决的积极的向敌人进攻、决不低头、不怕暂时的挫折和损失。今天不是保存力量长期隐蔽，而是使用出一切力量来放手发动游击战争。要有牺牲局部换取全面胜利的决心。各级领导机关干部均应密切联系群众在本地坚持，不得流亡各地，否则以违犯纪律论处。
    必须紧密联系群众、依靠群众，为了强化对敌斗争，广泛发展游击战争，应实行一元化的领导，成立县区村指挥部，县长兼队长，县书兼政委（区同此），有职有权。各分遣游击队（武工队同），又应有党政军民的各种工作人员，一揽子组织，以便每到一地开展各种工作，这是胜利的基本条件之一。
    坚决镇压倒算祸首、坚决打击“还乡团”、“倒算队”、“复仇队”，和一切反动武装，彻底清算其罪恶，采取各种方法。敌进我进，敌不进我亦进；集中优势兵力，以歼灭“还乡团”，分散兵力，以发动群众捕捉奸特等办法，对罪大恶极分子，经过群众公审处决；对胁从与附敌分子亦以战犯看待，实行洗脸擦黑，向群众承认错误退出倒算果实，开具连环保证，准其带罪立功的政策；对叛变投敌民兵村干等，如其决心回头为人民立功，准其带罪立功，如能在敌人方面进行革命工作并带枪回来，准其将功折罪。
    一切为着保护群众利益，为人民立功，时刻记住沦陷区原来就是、将来仍然是我们的根据地，要爱护他，决不可把他看成蒋管区或“殖民地”，抓一把的现象必须禁止。在蒋军进攻时曾一度离开群众退却逃跑的部队和干部，这是对不起人民的。应坚决打回去，向群众道歉，努力发动游击战争，在当地建立功勋；重建与群众的血肉关系。要保证良好的群众纪律，要尊重地方领袖和干部，在任何情况下都要与他们合作。号召民兵地方兵团游击队，地方干部为人民立功，开展立功运动。对长期坚持边地斗争的优秀干部、群众领袖，应特别给以表扬和奖励；对退却逃跑分子必须给予严厉处分。
    继续贯彻土地改革，保障群众的既得果实，打退倒算，对安分守己的中小地主应争取其回家，给以照顾。在沦陷区、边沿区土地改革的方针，一般应是集中力量打大的、打坏的，打的面要窄，得利面要宽。在方式上应是快斗快分、随斗随分，并应与反倒算武装斗争密切结合。对国民党的欺骗怀柔政策，如说“已分了的土地不变动，只要缴出三人名单（农会主任、武委会主任、政治主任）即可”等，应引用事实随时给以揭露。这只不过是敌人的武断宣传和阴谋。
    组织沦陷区群众生产。沦陷区生产停滞，增加我坚持斗争的困难。现若干地区蒋军虽已大部被驱逐，但因没有粮食吃，我较大部队亦无法活动。领此教训，应随时注意安定群众情绪，进行生产，特别是组织群众春耕，以支持长期斗争。在组织生产中，注意劳武结合，组织变工与反劳役反抓丁反掠夺的斗争相结合进行，对难民应从组织生产中进行救济。
    加强沦陷区边沿区的游击战争，准备反攻收复失地，只要我紧紧依靠群众坚持长期斗争，正确执行党的政策，我们一定能得到胜利！
