    Using Real Combat to Educate New Soldiers
    Jiao Wubao Creates a New Model
    Taiyue Military Region Leaders Call on Everyone to Learn From Him
    [This newspaper's Taiyue Front, 8th dispatch] Following the Wang Keqin movement, the Jiao Wubao mutual aid group of the Taiyue 407th unit created a model for educating new soldiers in combat and rapidly improving combat effectiveness. Now, the leaders of the Taiyue Military Region are calling for the widespread development of the Jiao Wubao movement. During the Yuanqu campaign, Jiao Wubao said: "This time, when fighting, we must not only complete the task but also lead the new soldiers to learn how to fight." Jiao Wubao is the mutual aid group leader of the ninth squad of the ninth company. He led two new soldiers, Cheng Beifang and Pang Tongshan. Before the attack, he held a meeting and told them that fighting was not scary. As long as they were calm, brave, and followed him, there would be no danger. He also carefully checked whether their grenade covers were removed and whether their shoes and leggings were tied properly. After such education, the new soldiers confidently said in unison: "This is safe." When the troops approached Xiguan and enemy artillery shells were constantly hitting their positions, Jiao Wubao helped them dig shelters while explaining: "As long as you do a good job of fortifications, hide down and don't move, and look forward, it's okay." Wang Baofa was injured because he didn't do a good job of fortifications, but those who did well were fine. Pang Tongshan realized that fortifications were useful, and the group leader was right. When climbing the city walls, enemy bullets whistled through the air. Jiao Wubao pulled Pang Tongshan and comforted them, saying: "The enemy is shooting blindly in the dark, listen to how high the bullets are flying, follow me and you'll be fine." The two new soldiers closely followed him into the city. The enemy counterattacked them and shouted: "Charge!" Pang Tongshan unconsciously shouted: "Here they come, here they come!" Cheng Beifang also asked: "What should we do?" Jiao Wubao calmly said: "Don't shout, prepare the grenades." He checked their grenades again, pulled out the fuses, and when the enemy charged, Jiao Wubao threw his grenade first, and Pang Tongshan and Cheng Beifang threw theirs after him. Enemy corpses fell into pools of blood, and the rest retreated in defeat. The two new soldiers experienced their own strength and said: "As long as we act in unison, the enemy is really weak."
    Jiao Wubao never relaxed giving new soldiers opportunities to practice on the battlefield, such as learning to shoot. After the new soldiers shot, they couldn't help but smile and say: "The group leader led us to learn how to fight. We are not afraid anymore when we fight again." After this battlefield practical education, Pang Tongshan had become a brave and experienced combatant when searching for the remaining enemies.

    用实地作战教育新战士
    焦五保创造新范例
    太岳军区首长号召大家学习
    【本报太岳前线八日电】继王克勤运动之后，太岳四○七部队焦五保互助组，创造了在作战中教育新战士，迅速提高战斗力的范例。现太岳军区首长号召普遍开展焦五保运动。在垣曲战役时焦五保说：“这回打仗不但要完成任务，还要带领新战士学会打仗。”焦五保是九连九班的互助组长，带领两个新战士成北方和庞铜山，在攻击前他就先开会，告诉他们打仗并不可怕，只要沉着勇敢跟我走就没有危险；并仔细检查了他们的手榴弹盖揭掉没有，鞋子绑腿扎好没有，新战士经过这样的教育都有信心的齐声说：“这可保险了。”当部队接近西关，敌人炮弹不断射击到他们阵地上时，焦五保便一边帮助他们挖掩体，一边解释说：“只要把工事做好，隐蔽下去不动，眼睛向前看就没关系。”王保法因为工事做的不好负了伤，工事做好的人都没甚，庞铜山由此认识了工事顶用，组长说的真对。当登城时敌人射击的子弹漫天呼啸，焦五保便拉住庞铜山安慰他们说：“黑洞洞地敌人打枪没准头，你听打的子弹多高，跟着我走没事。”两个新战士就紧跟着他冲入城里，敌人向他们反扑并狂吠着：“冲呀！”庞铜山不知不觉喊出：“来了，来了！”成北方也问：“怎么办？”焦五保沉着的说：“不要乱喊，把手榴弹准备好。”他又检查了一次他们的手榴弹，把导火绳拉出来，待敌人冲过来时，焦五保的手榴弹先扔出去，庞铜山、成北方也随着扔出去，敌人尸体倒在血泊里，其余的都溃退了。两个新战士亲身体验了自己的力量，都说：“只要我们动作一致，原来敌人很稀松。”
    焦五保在战场上时刻不放松给新战士实习的机会，如学习打枪等，新战士们打过枪后都情不自禁地笑着说：“组长带着我们学会了打仗，再打时我们都不害怕了。”经过这次战场实地教育后，在搜索残敌时，庞铜山已为一个勇敢而老练的战斗员。
