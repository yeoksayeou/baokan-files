Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: According to a report in the Wenhui Daily on the 10th, villagers in Changshu have repeatedly attacked grain requisition personnel. Earlier this month, the county government and the Land Rent Committee sent police chief Hu Lanteng, along with police officer Li Guankui and local laborers, to Jiangxiang Township to urge the collection of land tax. The villagers, unable to endure the heavy burden, were angered and confiscated their firearms, and tied up the two police officers, Hu and Li. Fei Kang, the Baozhang (local security chief) of Zhenmen Township, also collected land tax. On the night of the 4th, he was abducted by more than ten villagers to the Six Classics Bridge and shot dead.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: According to a report in the Shanghai Daily News on the 9th of this month, several armed rebel groups in the Zhoushan Islands of eastern Zhejiang and the vast sea area of Sanmen Bay are displaying formidable strength. Most of them are wearing grass-green military uniforms and carrying sophisticated weapons such as heavy machine guns and mortars. The ranks are composed of fishermen forced to take risks and guerrillas from the Anti-Japanese War period. Among them, the unit of Pan Zhongliang, active in the southern Jiushan area of Xiangshan, owns a steamship and two large sailing ships. It is said that fishermen were forced to take to the mountains due to the heavy exploitation by the Chiang Kai-shek government. For example, last year, a certain KMT (Kuomintang) dignitary sent his "direct line" troops to organize a "convoy" to the fishing areas to levy exorbitant taxes and levies from the fishermen under various pretexts, creating a large number of new "sea bandits."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: According to a report in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on the 9th, as of the end of December, Zhejiang Province had not collected even 30% of the total amount of land tax. Shen Honglie, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, issued a personal order to collect the full amount by the end of December and stipulated that the "achievement" of collecting actual grain would be the main criterion for evaluating the annual performance of county magistrates.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: According to a report in the Tianjin Dagong Daily on the 6th, rural areas in Tokto, a wealthy county in Suinan under the rule of Fu Zuoyi, are bankrupt, and civil uprisings are erupting everywhere. According to Wu Ye, Speaker of the county council, two-thirds of the farmers in the county have lost their ability to cultivate the land. For the three months since the autumn harvest, people have been filling their stomachs with bran and wild vegetables. After suffering from floods last year, the government continues to conscript soldiers and requisition grain. The government collected 39,400 shi (unit of dry measure) of land tax last year, and limited the collection to wheat, which is far more than the 30,000 shi of miscellaneous grains collected annually during the enemy and puppet regime period. By the end of last year, only 5,800 shi had been paid, but this had already exhausted their resources. The whole county has only more than 9,000 able-bodied young men. Last spring, 4,000 were conscripted, and now another 2,350 are required. Coupled with the young men who have fled to avoid conscription, the rural labor force has been completely depleted.

    常熟乡民武装抗征
    舟山民军声势浩大
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据十日文汇报载：常熟乡民连续袭击征粮人员。月初，县府及田租委员会派警长胡兰腾率警士李观奎及公役等到蒋巷乡催征田赋，乡民不胜苛扰，愤而收缴其枪械，并将胡、李两警捆押。珍门乡保长费康兼收田赋，四日深夜被乡民十余人挟至六经桥枪毙。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据本月九日沪报消息：浙东舟山群岛以迄三门湾辽阔海面上之民变武装若干部，声势甚炽，大都穿草绿色军装，携有重机枪迫击炮等精良武器。队伍为被迫挺而走险的渔民及抗日时期的游击部队等组成。其中活动于象山洋面南韭山一带之潘忠良一部，即拥有汽船一艘，大帆船两艘。据称渔民被逼上山，原因为蒋介石政府重重剥削。如去年国民党某要员派其“嫡系”部队组织“护航队”，到渔区向渔民巧立名目横征暴敛，又造成大批新的“海匪”。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据九日沪文汇报载：浙江全省田赋截至十二月底尚未收足总额之三成，浙省主席沈鸿烈曾手令于十二月底全部征集足额，并规定征实“成绩”为各县县长年终政绩之主要标准。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据六日津大公报载：傅作义统治之绥南富庶县份托克托农村破产，民变四起。据该县参议会议长吴业称：全县丧失耕作力之农民达三分之二，秋收后三个月来人民以糠皮野菜充饥，因去年遭受水灾后，继续以征兵征粮，政府去年征田赋三万九千四百石，且限收小麦，较之敌伪时期年征杂粮三万石超出甚巨。截至去年底，只缴到五千八百石，但已竭尽脂膏。全县只有适龄壮丁九千多，去年春天征了四千名，前又要二千三百五十名，加上逃避的壮丁，农村劳动力损失殆尽。
