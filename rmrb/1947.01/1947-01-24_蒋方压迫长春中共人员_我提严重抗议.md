Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: A dispatch from Beiping reports that General Ye Jianying, CCP member of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, lodged a serious protest with Nationalist Party member Zheng Jiemin regarding the Changchun incident, stating: According to a telegram from CCP representative Li Chuli, a major general, forwarded by the American representative in Changchun, on the evening of January 16th, the Changchun Garrison Headquarters of the Nationalist Party dispatched more than ten armed soldiers who broke into the dormitories of CCP personnel, seized the radio station, and placed CCP personnel under surveillance. Our side believes that this is a grave act of violence that undermines peace talks and attacks the Executive Headquarters. We hereby lodge a serious protest with your committee and request that you convey to the military authorities in Changchun to immediately return the radio station, restore the freedom of our personnel, and punish the personnel of the Garrison Headquarters who caused the incident to demonstrate fairness.
