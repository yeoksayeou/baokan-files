    Many Counties in Taihang Achieve "Cultivate Three, Reserve One"
    [This Newspaper News] Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Zhu Muzhi reports: The people of the Taihang region, amidst continuous and intense self-defense wars, have both participated in the war and engaged in production, overcoming all difficulties, and many counties have begun to achieve "cultivate three, reserve one." According to available materials, five counties including Pingshun, Licheng, Lucheng, Yushe, and Xingtai (old liberated area) have completed "cultivate three, reserve one" throughout the county. Among them, Pingshun County is known as the poorest county lacking all five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Many areas have even exceeded "cultivate three, reserve one." For example, in Licheng's two districts and Lucheng's old liberated area, out of 136 villages, 66 villages exceeded "cultivate two, reserve one." The 117 labor heroes from 44 counties attending the Second Taihang Regional Heroes Conference mostly led their villages to achieve "cultivate three, reserve one," while they themselves exceeded "cultivate three, reserve one." This great victory has laid a solid foundation for the people of the Taihang region to win the self-defense war and launch a counter-offensive, and has opened up a path to adequate food and clothing.
    The main reason for the Taihang region people's brilliant victory in production is that last year, the broad masses were further organized, and on this basis, a combination of agriculture and sideline occupations was implemented, and technology was improved and varieties were upgraded. The number of people organized last year exceeded four and a half times that of 1944 and twice that of 1945. According to statistics from eleven counties including Xiyang, Pingshun, Heshun, Wuxiang, Yushe, and Licheng, the number of people organized accounted for 78% of the total labor force. Many old men, women, and children participated in mutual aid production, and many villages achieved full village mutual aid.
  Large Increase in Number Participating in Mutual Aid, Surplus Labor Transferred to Sideline Occupations
    After such widespread organization, a large amount of labor was surplus, and this surplus labor was transferred to sideline production in a planned way. Relying on the mountains for resources and the water for sustenance, people in various places carried out spinning, weaving, transportation, silkworm breeding, animal husbandry, medicinal herb digging, and workshop operation according to local advantages and needs. These sideline productions greatly increased people's income. According to statistics from the above eleven counties, sideline income accounted for about 27% of people's total income last year. All areas that achieved "cultivate three, reserve one" did so by developing sideline production. For example, the sideline income of the people of Pingshun County accounted for about 30% of the total income last year, while Yushe's sideline income accounted for 47% of the total income. Wangjinzhuang in Shexian County, with an average of only 1.3 mu of land per person, developed sideline production last year, with sideline income accounting for about 40% of the total income, and the entire village achieved "cultivate three, reserve one." The combination of agriculture and sideline occupations has proven to be the only way for the Taihang region to achieve "cultivate three, reserve one." Now, most of the mutual aid teams and work assignment teams in various places have in fact developed into comprehensive cooperatives.
    Among sideline productions, spinning and weaving are the most prominent. Except for the newly liberated areas, almost no village does not engage in spinning and weaving. The income from spinning and weaving accounts for the main part of the total sideline income. For example, the spinning and weaving income of Pingshun accounts for 23% of the total sideline income. Now, the number of women engaged in spinning and weaving in the entire region has increased to 600,000, more than twice that of 1944. Last year, 12 million jin of cloth could be woven, with an average of 1.4 zhang of cloth per person in the entire region. The Taihang region used to rely mostly on foreign cloth, but now it has partially achieved self-sufficiency. The huge development of spinning and weaving has greatly reduced the expenses of the Taihang people and increased their wealth.
  Villages Organize Research Committees, Improve Technology and Upgrade Varieties
    Another major method to achieve "cultivate three, reserve one" is to improve agricultural technology and upgrade varieties. Last year, multiple hoeing and fertilization were common in various places. The general land was hoed three times, and many were hoed four times. Taking Chuandi Village in Pingshun as an example, the amount of fertilizer applied increased from only 17 dan per mu in 1937 to 60 dan last year. Many advanced villages applied more than 100 dan of fertilizer. Farmers also universally adopted progressive methods such as warm water seed soaking and field seed selection. These methods were only propaganda in 1944, but have now been accepted by farmers. In order to improve technology, technical research committees have been organized in various places. 170 out of 177 villages in Pingshun have established such research committees, with experienced farmers and labor heroes responsible for researching and improving various agricultural technologies. In terms of variety improvement, 36,000 mu of 169 wheat and 82,000 mu of Golden Queen corn were promoted this year (statistics from six counties including Licheng and Lucheng). These superior varieties yielded significantly more than ordinary local varieties. For example, Golden Queen averaged 2.2 shi per mu, while local corn averaged only 1.2 shi. Due to technological improvements and variety upgrades, Licheng, Pingshun, and Lucheng counties increased production by a total of 550,000 shi this year, with Licheng's increase accounting for 30% of the total agricultural production. This huge income helped the people achieve "cultivate three, reserve one."

    太行不少县份实现耕三余一
    【本报讯】新华社特派记者朱穆之报导：太行区人民在连续的紧张的自卫战争中，一面参战，一面生产，排除万难，不少县份开始实现耕三余一。据已得材料，平顺、黎城、潞城、榆社、邢台（老解放区）等五县，已全县完成耕三余一，其中平顺县乃素称金木水火土五行俱缺的最贫苦县份。有许多地区并超过了耕三余一。如黎城二个区和潞城老解放区共一三六个村庄中，有六六个村超过了耕二余一。出席太行二届群英大会来自四四县的一一七个劳动英雄，绝大多数带领全村实现了耕三余一，而他们自己则都超过了耕三余一。这一伟大的胜利，为太行区人民奠定了自卫战争胜利反攻的稳固基础，并开辟了到达丰衣足食的道路。
    太行区人民在生产上获得如此辉煌的胜利，主要原因是去年进一步的组织起来了广大的群众，并在这个基础上实行农副业结合和提高技术，改良品种。去年全区组织起来的人数超过了四四年的四倍半，四五年的二倍。按昔阳、平顺、和顺、武乡、榆社、黎城等十一个县的统计，组织起来的人数占全部劳力的百分之七十八。许多老汉妇女和儿童都参加了互助生产，很多村庄达到全村互助。
  参加互助人数大增  剩余劳力转入副业
    在这样普遍的组织起来后，劳动力大量剩余，这些剩余劳动力有计划的转入副业生产。靠山吃山，靠水吃水，各地人民都按照各地的地利及需要，进行纺织、运输、喂蚕、牧畜、刨药材、开作坊。这些副业生产大大增加了人民的收入。根据上述十一县的统计，去年副业收入约占人民全部收入的百分之二十七。所有达到耕三余一的地区，都是由于发展了副业生产。如平顺县人民的副业收入去年约占全部收入的百分之三十，榆社的副业收入则占全部收入的百分之四十七。每人平均只有一亩三分地的涉县王金庄，去年发展了副业生产，副业收入占到总收入的约百分之四十，全村达到了耕三余一。农业与副业的结合证明为太行区达到耕三余一的必由之路。现在各地的互助组、拨工队事实上大部分已发展成为一揽子合作社。
    在副业生产中，纺织则最为突出。除新解放区外，几乎没有一个村庄不纺织。纺织的收入占全部副业收入的主要部分。如平顺的纺织收入占全部副业收入的百分之二十三。现在全区从事纺织的妇女已发展到六十万人，超过四四年的二倍，去年可织布一千二百万斤，全区平均每人可得布一丈四尺。太行区从前绝大部分仰给于外来布匹，现在则部分达到了自给自足。纺织的巨大发展，使太行人民大大减少了开支，增加了财富。
  各村组织研究委会  提高技术改良品种
    达到耕三余一的另一个主要方法是提高农作技术与改良品种。去年各地普遍的多锄多上粪，一般的地都锄了三遍，有许多锄到四遍。上粪的数目以平顺川底村为例，三七年每亩仅上粪十七担，去年则增加到六十担。许多先进的村庄则上粪一百担以上。农民并普遍的采用了温汤浸种，田间选种等进步方法，这些方法在四四年还只是一种宣传，现在已为农民所接受。为了提高技术，各地都组织了技术研究委员会，平顺一百七十七个村庄，有一百七十个村成立了这种研究会，老农及劳动英雄负责研究改进各种农作技术。在改良品种方面，今年推广一六九小麦三万六千亩，金皇后玉蜀黍八万二千亩（黎城潞城等六个县的统计）。这些优良品种比一般土种产量超过甚大，如金皇后平均每亩可打二石二斗，而土种玉茭平均只打一石二斗。由于技术提高，品种改良，黎城、平顺、潞城三县，今年共增产五十五万石，黎城增产量占全部农产的百分之三十。这一个巨大的收入，帮助着人民达到了耕三余一。
