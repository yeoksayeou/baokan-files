　　Soviet Patriotic Self-Defense Poetry Selection, Part Two
    A Mother's Instructions
    By Su Fu'er Gong

    To defend the motherland, the hero sets out on the Long March,
    The afterglow on the field is as red as flames…
    The heart of a lion wants to burst in the young man's chest,
    The mountain breeze blows, gently kissing the hero…
    The white-haired mother opens her arms to embrace him,
    She holds back the tears in her eyes to hug her own flesh and blood,
    She hugs the hero defending the country with both hands,
    Pressing him tightly to her bosom…
    "You are going to fight the enemy, my child,
    For the great glory of our beloved motherland!
    Ah, son, I am so happy, with my milk,
    I have nourished a hero for the motherland…
    To kill the enemy, you must be skillful and ruthless,
    You must strike them hard and heavy!
    Take good care of your warhorse,
    Cherish your rifle like a treasure.
    A soldier's weapon must be well protected,
    Only then can it perform amazing feats when needed…
    A good rider must always gallop ahead,
    Fight bravely to bring glory to the country!
    We all remember Chapayev and that O’glyu (Note 1),
    You must be as heroic as they were.
    If you meet Stalin, – no matter what,
    Send him my regards and wish him good health!
    As soon as the peaches in our orchard are ripe,
    I will send them to you as a gift.
    Just focus on fighting the enemy, like a little lion,
    Fight again and again, don't let up.
    Be careful not to fall down before the time comes!...
    I wish you a safe journey, may we meet again soon!..."
    The rider gallops away, the sun rises high,
    The hilltop shudders, making way…
    She throws a handful of water behind her son,
    Watching his back, smiling proudly (Note 2)...
    The poet praises loudly, stepping forward to kiss her hand:
    "Glory, to the motherland and the mother, true glory!..."

    [Note 1] Chapayev and Kot Oglyu, guerrilla heroes of the Soviet Civil War.
    [Note 2] Splashing water for farewell is a Russian custom.

　　苏联爱国自卫诗选之二
    母亲的嘱咐
    苏·符尔共  作
    为了保卫祖国，英雄出发去长征，
    地头上的霞光火焰一样红。……
    青年的胸中狮子样的心要迸，
    吹来了山风轻轻吻英雄……
    白发母亲张开手来把他拥抱，
    她忍住了满眶的眼泪抱起亲生，
    她把卫国的英豪双手抱起，
    紧紧地压在自己的怀胸。……
    “你要跟敌人打仗啦，我的孩子，
    为亲爱祖国的伟大光荣！
    啊，儿啊，我真高兴，用我的奶，
    给祖国喂出了一位英雄。……
    杀敌人要有计巧要下绝情，
    你打他们要打得又狠又重！
    要把自己的战马好好照料，
    把枪支像宝贝一样爱敬。
    战士的武器要保护得好，
    用着时才做得出惊人举动。……
    好骑手总要是当先飞跑，
    打猛仗给国家增加光荣！
    咱这块都记得夏伯阳跟那奥格柳（注一），
    你也要做得像他们一样英雄。
    要是你碰见了史大林，——无论如何，
    替我问好祝他的身体康宁！
    一等到咱们果园里桃子熟了，
    我就把它当礼物寄你手中。
    你只顾打敌人，像小狮子，
    打一次又一次不要放松。
    当心着，可别要不到时候就摔倒！……
    祝你一路平安吧，不久重逢！……”
    骑师纵马奔，太阳高高升，
    山头儿抖一抖，让出条路程……
    她在儿子背后泼上一捧水，
    望着他背影高傲地笑盈盈（注二）……
    诗人高声颂扬着，上前把她的手来亲：
    “光荣啊，祖国和母亲，真光荣！…”
    【注一】夏伯阳和寇·奥格柳，苏联内战时的游击队英雄。
    【注二】泼水送别，是俄国人的习俗。
