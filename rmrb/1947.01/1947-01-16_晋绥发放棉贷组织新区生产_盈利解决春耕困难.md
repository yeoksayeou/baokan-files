　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 13th: The Jin-Sui Administrative Office has decided to issue 200,000 jin of cotton loans to urgently organize winter production among the masses in the newly liberated areas of southwest Jin, using production profits to solve various difficulties in spring plowing. Currently, a financial and economic work team composed of the CCP Jin-Sui Branch Bureau and the Administrative Office has been divided into four groups and dispatched to Xiaoyi, Xi County, Fenxi and other places to cooperate with local governments in the distribution work. It is expected that 40,000 jin can be distributed before the Lunar New Year. The Luliang District Party Committee has issued a special call to all Party, government, and civilian personnel, urging them to link this work with mobilizing the masses to support the front lines, and to give special consideration to poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, as well as poor farmers, to prevent dispersion and ensure fairness and reasonableness. In addition to textile production, efforts should also be made to actively organize the masses to open oil presses, dig coal kilns, and engage in ironwork production. The elderly and children should be mobilized to collect firewood and manure, so that the people can rebuild their homes after the disaster.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th: Qidong County, a frontline county in the anti-"mopping-up" struggle in the Su-Zhong area, is still actively engaged in production and construction despite the extremely difficult struggle. The county's democratic government is now issuing millions of jin of textile loan grain to develop the private textile industry. The Ninth Special District Commissioner's Office has entrusted the Central China Bank Office to issue 10,000 shi of agricultural loan grain to help farmers prepare for spring plowing. Farmers in various places are now actively accumulating fertilizer and purchasing farm implements. The regulations for textile loan grain stipulate that for every 36 jin of corn received, 1 jin of Grade A market cloth must be delivered. In Hui'an District alone, the masses have received 700,000 jin of corn, and 9,000 women have participated in textile production. The number of oil presses in the county has increased by one-third compared to before the land reform, and the wages of oil pressing workers have increased from 1.5 sheng of rice per press to 2.5 sheng.

    盈利解决春耕困难
    【新华社晋绥十三日电】晋绥行署决定发放廿万斤棉贷，紧急组织晋西南新解放区群众冬季生产，以生产盈利解决春耕中之各种困难。刻由中共晋绥分局和行署组成之财经工作团，已分四组前往孝义、隰县、汾西等地，协同当地政府进行发放工作，预计旧历年前可发放四万斤。吕梁区党委特号召全体党政民工作人员，以此工作与发动群众支援前线联系进行，要特别照顾贫苦烈、军属及贫苦农民，防止分散做到公平合理。除纺织外并认真组织群众开油坊、挖炭窑、做铁工等生产，发动老年、儿童打柴拾粪，务使劫后人民重整家园。
    【新华社华中十二日电】苏中江防前哨启东县，在极艰苦的反“清剿”斗争中，仍积极进行生产建设。该县民主政府现发放数百万斤纺织贷粮，以发展民间纺织业。九专署委托华中银行办事处，发放农贷粮一万石，帮助农民准备春耕，现各地农民正积极积肥与添购农具。纺织贷粮规定每领玉米三十六斤，交甲等市布一斤，仅惠安区群众即领到玉米七十万斤，已有九千余妇女参加纺织。该县油坊较土地改革前增加三分之一，榨油工人工资由每栊大米一升半增至二升半。
