　　The Government of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region announces
    The Progress of the Yellow River Returning to its Old Course Project
    (Continued and Completed)
    On the same day, General Zhou Enlai and UNRRA representatives Mr. Frank Ryer and Mr. Todd also reached a verbal agreement. The main contents were: overcome all difficulties to start the downstream levee restoration and river dredging work as soon as possible. All materials, food, and wages required for the project would be supplied by UNRRA and the Executive Yuan, without any military or political influence. The Executive Yuan would set up an office in Heze to handle the supply of materials and equipment, with the participation of the Chinese Communist Party. The relief for the resettlement of residents from the riverbed would be handled by committees organized by all parties. Before June 15th, no diversion canals were to be dug below Huayuankou's old course, and the Xinbian Railway and highway were not to be dismantled. Any changes after June 15th would be subject to agreement between the two parties, depending on the progress of the downstream project. Pile driving would continue. Whether or not to throw stones would be decided by agreement between the two parties before June 15th, depending on the progress of the downstream project. If it was decided to throw stones, it would not exceed two meters above the riverbed. This agreement was thoroughly implemented after repeated consideration by Zhou Enlai, Marshall, and Xue Dubi.

    At the same time, our representatives also negotiated with UNRRA and the Executive Yuan in Nanjing on the issue of material and equipment supply, agreeing that the first batch of 10 billion yuan for construction and 25,000 tons of flour would be shipped to Heze and Huimin respectively. The resettlement fee for residents of the riverbed was also agreed upon at 15 billion yuan.

    After these agreements were reached, we faithfully implemented them. Construction started at the end of May, and full-scale construction began on June 10th. The Ninth Working Team of the Executive Yuan's Henan Branch arrived in Heze on June 1st. Representatives of the Executive Yuan and UNRRA stationed in Heze, Wang Hechen and Peng Anjie, also arrived in Heze on May 24th and June 1st, respectively. However, before the middle of June, only more than 300 tons of flour were delivered, causing a huge obstacle to the progress of the project. (Until today, I have only received 6 billion yuan for construction, and the resettlement fee for residents of the riverbed has not been paid at all).

    The Kuomintang not only failed to implement the agreement on material supply, obstructing the project, but also instructed its troops and secret agents to prevent and sabotage our full-scale levee restoration. For example: On June 1st, a unit of more than 500 men from the 74th Division of the Kuomintang 55th Army stationed in Mafang (20 miles northeast of Kaocheng) sneaked into Caozhuang and raided the masses building the He-Kao Highway (which was jointly agreed upon with UNRRA and the Executive Yuan for transporting levee restoration materials), seriously injuring two people. On the 8th, a unit of the Kuomintang 68th Army stationed in Changyuan invaded the liberated area of Yantanzhuang and set up strongholds, disturbing the area and preventing the masses from starting levee restoration work. On the same day, a unit of the puppet Third District Team entrenched in the county sneaked into eight villages including Da Xia Huangzhuang Louzhai in our liberated area, arrested the village chiefs, and threatened the masses, saying: "Whoever restores the levee will have their whole family killed." On June 9th, more than ten Kuomintang secret agents including Yang Xiao in Qiyucheng, cooperated with more than 300 men from the puppet Li Lianxiang's unit and attacked the areas of Jasi and Xiaolizhuang along the river, killing three people restoring the levee and looting extensively. On the 14th, Zhang Xingnong, the section chief of the Changqing defense section, and engineer Zhang Xing and six others inspected the levee project to the west of Xiaoyanzhuang in the eighth district. Engineer Zhang Xing and five others were surrounded, tied up, and hacked to death with sickles by Kuomintang secret agents. Section Chief Zhang died heroically after being shot three times. Only one cook escaped. On the evening of the 16th, Kuomintang puppet troops Sun Kang and Fang Zige from Changqing City led more than 20 men from the puppet Ninth District Team and sneaked into the village where the levee restoration workers were stationed. Taking advantage of the workers' sleep, they arrested Li Xingjie, the leader of the levee restoration workers, and Lu Guangchen, the office manager, beat and forced the workers, and robbed 1,200 kilograms of white flour from the workers. On the afternoon of the 18th, Zheng Chuangguang and others sneaked into the levee restoration site in the eighth district of Feicheng and carried out extensive looting and harassment. At dawn on the 23rd, a unit of the Kuomintang army in Changyuan, carrying more than ten machine guns, suddenly attacked the villages beside the dam in the county, killing 12 of our cadres, militiamen, and masses. During our levee restoration period, such incidents of sabotage and obstruction occurred endlessly everywhere. However, under these various difficulties, we still persisted in the levee restoration work, and the first phase of the project was completed at the end of June. After that, due to difficulties in advancing construction funds and even greater destruction and harassment by Kuomintang troops, the second-phase bend straightening and dangerous area treatment project was forced to stop and could not continue.

    In accordance with the Nanjing agreement, the issue of blocking the breach was discussed in Kaifeng on June 15th, but no results were achieved. The two parties then agreed to postpone the discussion until July 1st. However, while the Kuomintang procrastinated, repeatedly urging payment of public funds but refusing to allocate them and armed harassment of the levee restoration project, they unilaterally threw stones to block the breach on June 22nd without notifying our side. Our representatives repeatedly protested to the Kuomintang in Nanjing and Kaifeng, but the Kuomintang completely ignored it and actively dug diversion canals, dismantled the Xinbian Road, closed the gap, and released water.

    Due to the imminent flood, the river water rose sharply, and the wooden piles and stone dams at the breach were successively washed away. Desperate attempts to repair them for more than 20 days were unsuccessful, and the Kuomintang was forced to stop blocking the breach. Later, General Zhou Enlai flew from Nanjing to Kaifeng on July 19th to personally observe the breach-blocking project at Huayuankou. On the 20th, he attended the Kaifeng Yellow River Symposium. With the unanimous agreement of representatives from all parties, it was formally decided to stop blocking the breach before the great flood. After late July, the great flood arrived, and the breach-blocking project was washed away even more. The Kuomintang's conspiracy to close the breach and release water had to be temporarily stopped. It was also under these circumstances that millions of our residents along the river were temporarily spared from the disaster of being submerged.

    In early August, the Kuomintang launched a large-scale offensive against our Ji-Lu-Yu area. The UNRRA and Executive Yuan offices in Heze were ordered to withdraw to Kaifeng, which I tried to retain several times without success. Since August, they have successively occupied Heze, Jining, and other places in our area. The materials and equipment for repairing dangerous areas stored in Heze City were looted by the Kuomintang. Kuomintang aircraft carried out countless air raids on towns and villages on both sides of our river. In Linpuji alone, more than 60 of our levee restoration workers were killed. At this point, the levee restoration project could no longer continue. The newly repaired levees from Changyuan, Dongming to Juancheng and Puyang were excavated by the Kuomintang invading troops to create fortifications, and were already badly damaged.

    On December 18th, members of our Yellow River Committee and Director Duan and Jia of the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office met with American advisor Todd and Qi Shou'an, deputy director of the Kuomintang Breach Restoration Bureau, and more than ten others in Zhangqiu Town to discuss the continued levee restoration and postponement of the breach-blocking issue, but no results were achieved. Under such circumstances where the levee restoration was destroyed and the dangerous areas were not repaired, the Kuomintang, disregarding the lives of 7 million people along the river, brazenly diverted the Yellow River water into the old course on December 5th. Their conspiracy to drown the people in our area was completely exposed to the world.

    For the sake of the lives of 7 million people along the river, our Deputy Chairman Rong of the Border Government and Deputy Commander Teng Daiyuan of the Military Region, held talks with Todd et al. in Handan on January 3rd and reached a verbal agreement: first, to block the water diverted into the old course of the Yellow River to prevent it from continuing to flow down; second, to send engineers to investigate the river堤 immediately and allocate the overdue construction funds immediately; and third, to negotiate in Shanghai to allocate construction funds immediately.

    However, until now, the water continues to flow, the materials and construction funds have not arrived, 600,000 residents in the riverbed are in danger, and the danger of 7 million residents along the river being buried in the belly of fish is imminent. This is the entire process of negotiation and project progress for the Yellow River returning to its old course.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府公布
    黄河归故交涉及工程进行经过
    （续完）
    同日周恩来将军与联总代表福兰克芮及塔德二先生，亦获得口头协议，其主要内容为下游复堤浚河克服一切困难从速开工，工程需要之一切器材、工粮，由联总、行总供给，不受任何军事政治影响。行总为办理物资器材之供应事项，在荷泽设立办事处，由中共参加。河道居民迁移之救济，由各方组织委员会负责办理。六月十五日前花园口以下故道不挖引河，新汴铁路及公路不得拆除。六月十五日后视下游工程进行情形，经双方协议后始得改变之。打桩仍继续进行，关于抛石与否，须待六月十五日前视下游工程进行情形，然后经双方协议决定，如决定抛石亦以不超过河底两公尺为限。该项协定经周恩来、马歇尔、薛笃弼再三考虑，保证彻底执行。
    同时我方代表，并在京与联总行总商谈了物资器材供应问题，商定第一批拨工款一百亿、面粉二万五千吨，最近分别运抵荷泽、惠民。河床居民迁移费亦经商妥拨付一百五十亿元。
    这些协议成立后，我即忠实执行。五月底开始动工，六月十日全线大动工。行总河南分署第九工作队，六月一日到达荷泽，行总及联总驻荷办事处代表王贺宸、彭安杰亦先后于五月二十四日，六月一日到达荷泽。但在六月半前除运到面粉三百余吨外其他均未运到，使工程进行发生极大阻碍。（直到今日我只收到工款六十亿，河床居民迁移费分文未给）。
    国民党不仅在物资供应上不执行协议使工程受到阻碍，且在我全线复堤时指使其军队、特务，大肆阻止破坏。如：六月一日驻马坊（考城东北二十里）之国民党五十五军七十四师一部五百余，窜至曹庄，奔袭我修筑荷考公路（为运输复堤器材与联总行总共同商定修筑者）之群众，致二人负重伤。八日驻长垣国民党军六十八军一部，侵至解放区阎谭庄按扎据点，四出扰乱，阻止群众动工复堤。同日盘据该县之伪三区队一部，窜至我解放区大小黄庄楼砦等八村，捕走村长，并恐吓群众谓：“谁复堤，杀谁全家”。六月九日齐禹城内国特杨校等十余人，配合伪李连祥部三百余人，向我沿河贾寺、小李庄一带进犯、杀死修堤群众三人，并大肆抢劫，十四日长清修防段段长张兴农与工程师张兴等七人，视察堤案至八区西小燕庄，张兴工程师等六人，被国特包围捆打，用镰刀砍死，张段长连中三弹壮烈牺牲，仅逃出伙夫一人。十六日晚长清城内国民党伪军孙康、房泽阁等率领伪九区队二十余人，窜至修堤工人驻村，乘工人熟睡之际，将复堤工人小队长李兴杰，事务长卢光臣捕去，对工人横行逼打，并抢去工人白面一千二百斤。十八日下午郑传光等又窜至肥城八区修堤处，大肆抢掠骚扰。二十三日拂晓，长垣国民党军一部，携机枪十余挺，突袭该县大堤旁村庄，打死我干部民兵群众十二人。在我复堤期间诸如此类破坏阻挠事件，各地层出不穷，然而我在此种种困难下仍坚持复堤工作，于六月底第一段工程告竣。此后因工款垫支困难，国民党部队破坏袭扰更甚，致第二裁期湾裁直整理险工被迫停止无法继续开工。
    遵照南京协议，六月十五日在开封商谈堵口问题，但无结果，又经双方约定延至七月一日再行商谈。然而国民党一面推拖，对公款多次催促均拒不拨付与武装扰乱复堤工程，一面于六月二十二日，未通知我方，擅自抛石堵口，我代表在京汴两地一再向国民党提出抗议，但国民党完全置之不理，并积极挖引河、拆除新汴路，合龙放水。
    由于大泛将至，河水陡涨，堵口处之木桩石坝相继被冲。拚命抢补二十余日毫无成就，国民党始被迫停止堵口。嗣由周恩来将军七月十九日由京飞汴，亲往花园口观察堵口工程，二十日出席开封黄河座谈会，始在各方代表一致同意下，正式决定大泛前停止堵口。七月下旬后大泛到临、堵口工程被冲更多，国民党之合庞放水阴谋，不得不被迫暂时停顿。也就在这种情形下，我沿河数百万居民当时始得暂免于灭顶之祸。
    八月初国民党向我冀鲁豫大举进攻，联总行总驻荷办事处，奉命撤回开封，我几经挽留未果。自八月起先后侵占我荷泽、济宁等地，荷泽市内所存之修理险工物资器材，被国民党抢劫一空。国民党飞机，对我沿河两岸城镇村庄，进行了无数次的空袭，仅临濮集一次即扫死我修堤员工六十余人。复堤工程，至此已无法继续，长垣东明至鄄城濮阳段新修复大堤，被国民党侵入之军队挖掘作战工事，已破坏得残破不堪。
    十二月十八日，我黄委会各委员、冀鲁豫行署段，贾主任于张秋镇与美籍顾问塔德、国民党堵复副局局长齐寿安等十余人，商讨黄河继续复堤延缓堵口问题，未获结果。就在这样复堤被毁，险工未修的情况下，国民党竟置沿河七百万人民生命于不顾，悍然于十二月五日将黄河水引入故道，其蓄意淹毙我区人民之阴谋于此已大白于天下。
    为沿河七百万人民生命计，我边府戎副主席，军区滕代远副司令员，于一月三日与塔德等于邯郸会商成立口头协议：一先将引入黄河故道之水堵住，不使再续往下流；二、即日派工程师调查河堤，并即刻拨付拖久之工款；三、到上海交涉让立即拨工款等。
    但直至现在水仍续流物资，工款仍未到，河床六十万居民已陷于危难，沿河七百万居民葬身鱼腹之患亦随之俱来，这就是黄河归故问题交涉与工程进行的全部经过。
