Julu Villages Hold Democratic Unity Meetings
Cadres Voluntarily Return Excess Gains

[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 26th dispatch] In Julu, through democratic unity meetings between village cadres and the masses, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been improved, and the rent reduction movement is proceeding smoothly. Li Guiwu, a representative of the Julu Third District, Xiaoqu District, said at a unity meeting: "In the past struggles, I had some selfish motives, I wanted a house and five acres of land. After I was satisfied, I was no longer active in the joint struggle in Songzhuang." Qiao Yongxi said: "I was fond of scolding people and always wanted to be in charge. In the struggle, I privately wanted three acres of land and planted peanuts. Now I admit my mistake and will return the land and peanuts to everyone." The masses were very happy to hear the cadres confess their mistakes and said: "This is truly implementing democracy." The masses in Da Zhangzhuang in the Second District were dissatisfied with the cadres' embezzlement, and their enthusiasm for this rent reduction was not high. The turn-over team convened village cadres to enlighten them, explaining that if the work style was not changed, the masses could not be mobilized, and internal problems should be solved internally. After a day of reflection, the village cadres confessed their mistakes to all the members that evening and apologized. Tenant representative Lü Jinxiang said: "I exchanged the house I fought for for a better one, and I wanted several acres of good wheat seedling land. I personally have turned over a new leaf. I confessed my wrongdoings, and I will definitely lead everyone to work actively in the future and strive for a common new life." All the village cadres confessed their mistakes of embezzling the fruits of victory and swore: "If I repeat my mistakes, I am willing to be punished by the masses." After such democratic unity meetings in various villages, the village cadres humbly reflected on their mistakes and changed their work style. The masses went to the cadres with smiles and said: "Let's resolve our differences. If you cherish us, we will support you. With one heart, we will completely turn over a new leaf."

    巨鹿各村干部群众
    召开民主团结会议
    干部自动退出多分果实
    【本报威县廿六日电】巨鹿经过村干部都与群众的民主团结会议，干部与群众关系得到改善，查减运动顺利开展。巨鹿三区小区代表李桂五在团结会议上说：“过去斗争中我有些私心，要了房一所，地五亩，自己得到满足后，宋庄联合斗争时就再不积极。”乔永西说：“我好骂人，好占上风，在斗争中私要了三亩地，种了花生，现在我承认错误并把地连花生退给大家。”群众听到干部反省了错误，非常喜欢，都说：“这才是真实行了民主哩。”二区大张庄群众对干部的中饱都不满意，这次查减中情绪不高，翻身队召集村干作启发，说明作风不转变，群众就发动不起来，内部问题要内部解决。他们经一天的反省，当晚村干向全体会员坦白道歉。佃户代表吕金箱说：“斗出的宅子，我换了一处好的，要了几亩好麦苗地，我个人是翻了身了，我坦白了我的不对，今后一定领着大家积极干，争取共同翻身。”各个村干都把中饱果实的错误坦白出来，并宣誓：“如再重复错误，愿叫群众处罚。”各村经过这样的民主团结大会，村干虚心反省了错误，改变了作风，群众都笑嘻嘻的去找干部说：“咱们解疙瘩，你爱惜我们，我们拥护你，团结一条心，彻底闹翻身。”
