Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. According to the Shanghai News on the 8th, a "Kaifeng dispatch" stated: Twenty thousand students from universities and middle schools in Kaifeng, led by National Henan University, held a demonstration parade on the morning of the 4th to protest against American military atrocities and demand the immediate withdrawal of American troops from China. After the procession departed from Henan University, it was joined by the private Zhongzheng College, the National Water Conservancy School, the Henan Women's Work-Study School, and the Henan Zhongzhou Middle School. The procession stretched for two or three miles, and the slogans resounded through the sky. A female professor from Henan University, holding a small flag, led a team of female students from Henan University, interspersed within the main body, shouting "Down with imperialism!" and "Drive the American troops out of the country!" The armed forces dispatched by the authorities had no choice but to accompany the main body on both sides, without taking any action. Passersby stopped to watch, and the streets were empty. Afterwards, the Henan Provincial Government held an emergency meeting, ordering various newspapers to "not excessively sensationalize" the parade, but the Minquan News and the China Times still published editorials expressing sympathy for the parade. The Times, under the title "The Exaltation of National Self-Esteem," recounted the atrocities of the American military in China and pointed out that the Americans "will eventually suffer the consequences of their own evil deeds."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. According to a special dispatch from the Shanghai Wenhui Daily in Chongqing on the 6th: More than ten thousand students from over ten schools in Chongqing today (6th) staged a large parade that shook the mountain city to protest against American military atrocities. Students from the Shapingba area, led by Chongqing University, marched dozens of miles into the city to join students from the urban area. During the parade, they went to the headquarters to petition. Citizens expressed great sympathy, and many people offered flowers along the way to express their appreciation. An elderly man with white hair joined the parade line, and rickshaw pullers and shoe-shining children also joined the ranks, shouting slogans.

    【新华社延安二十日电】据沪报八日载“开封通讯”称：开封大中学生二万人，由国立河南大学领导，于四日晨举行示威大游行，抗议美军暴行，要求美军立即退出中国。队伍从河南大学出发后，沿途参加的有私立中正学院、国立水利专科学校、河南妇女工读学校、河南中州中学等，队伍蜿蜒二三里，口号声震天。河大某女教授手执小旗，一面率领河大女生一队，夹杂大队之中，高呼“打倒帝国主义！”“驱逐美军出境！”当局所派武装部队只好在大队两侧随行，无何作为。行路者伫足而观，万人空巷。事后河南省政府召开紧急会议，令各报对游行一事“勿过分渲染”，但民权新闻、中国时报等仍发表社评，对游行表同情。时报以《民族自尊心的昂扬》为题，历述美军在华暴行，并指出美人“终必自食其恶果”。
