    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: According to reports from Shanghai newspapers such as Xinwen and Dagong, the popular uprising armed forces in Fujian are shaking the entire province. As of last winter, the "Big Sword Society" in southern Zhejiang, which originally had more than 1,000 men and guns, has expanded to the coastal areas of northeastern Fujian, including Xiapu and Fuding counties. The county has captured places such as Yushanfeng. There is also the Jin Jinbiao unit active in Songxi, on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang. In Yunxiao and Zhao'an counties in southern Fujian, there is the Chen Wenping unit of more than 100 people, whose base is in a strategically important area with mountains on one side and the sea on the other, and maintains close contact with peasant armed forces in Raoping and other places in Guangdong. In Yongchun, Nan'an, Tong'an, and Anxi counties northeast of Xiamen, insurgents are active everywhere. Insurgents in Jian'ou and Nanping have ships and patrol the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. Insurgents are everywhere on the sea. Along the Fu (zhou) - Gu (tian) - Jian (ou) highway and the Nan (ping) - Jian (yang) highway, there is an insurgent unit of more than 100 men and guns, which has been operating freely for several years. Another unit of more than 100 people operates unhindered between Yongtai, Gutian, and Linsen counties. All security regiments in Fujian province have been mobilized, but they cannot defend against them.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: According to a report in the Tianjin Dagong Bao on the 3rd, in the second half of December, insurgent armed forces in the Yunnan area were active in counties in the north and south. In Jian'shui area on the Ge-Bi-Shi branch line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, there are hundreds of people led by Li Mingfu, Bai Zhenggui, Bai Zhengfu, and Bai Chunshan. In Longwu, Shiping, and Jianshui counties, there are hundreds of people under Long Yonghe, using Laohe Mountain as their base. In counties on the border of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Vietnam, there are more than 400 people led by Lan Bingyi. All units are "equipped with extremely new weapons" and are resisting the "suppression" of the Second Security General Team of the Chiang government in the southwest. The Ma Fu'an unit in Chejia Village, Jianshui, which was transferred from Guangnan County on the border of Yunnan and Guangxi, is confronting a certain unit of the 93rd Brigade of the Chiang army. In late last month, a rebel force of more than 100 people approached the south gate of Shiping County on the Ge-Bi-Shi Railway and went to the mountains south of the county. The county government was unable to attack and had to close the city gates. Insurgent armed forces are also constantly active in Anning, Luoci northwest of Kunming, and Wuding and other counties southwest of Kunming.

    This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th: Near Luoyang, the Chiang government's exorbitant taxes and levies are extremely heavy, and residents are brewing a popular uprising. According to information, the Luoyang War Zone Command, in order to stabilize the market, arrested civilian laborers on a large scale last year to repair the city walls, with each township responsible for 72 zhang (approximately 240 meters) in length, costing 70,000 yuan per zhang. All twenty-four townships in the county needed a total of 13.96 million yuan. In addition, the construction of five gate towers required 16.25 million yuan. To repair Luoyang city, a total of 170 million yuan was needed. As a result, taxes were heavy and plunder was intensified, with each mu (approximately 0.067 hectares) of land costing 40,000 yuan per month, and each person (poll tax) costing 2,000 yuan per month. Currently, armed robbery is used to collect taxes near Luoyang, and residents are impoverished. There is no grain in their homes, and they live by eating tree bark and chewing grass roots. Several landlords in Aocun (under Luoyang) were driven out by the masses, who divided up their granaries of accumulated grain. South of Luoyang, some people are preventing wealthy people from walking around. Poor people are gathering in groups and brewing: "Anyway, we can't live here anymore, so let's fight!"

    【新华社延安二十七日电】据沪新闻、大公等报透露，福建民变武装震撼全境，截至去冬原有人枪千余之浙南“大刀会”已发展至闽东北滨海地区霞浦、福鼎等县，县已攻占俞山峰诸处，尚有金锦标部活动于闽浙边之松溪一带。闽南之云霄、诏安等县有陈文平部百余人，所据地势倚山面海极为险要，更与广东饶平等地农民武装密切联系。厦门东北之永春、南安、同安及安溪等县变民到处活动。建瓯、南平一带变民备有船舶，游戈于闽江上游。海面变民则到处皆是。福（州）古（田）建（瓯）公路及南（平）建（阳）公路沿线，有百余人枪之变民一部，数年来，行动自如。永泰、古田、林森等县间另有一部百余人，纵横无阻。福建全省保安团均行出动，但防不胜防云。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】据三日津大公报消息，十二月下半月云南区变武装活跃南北各县，云南滇越铁路个碧石支线上之建水一带，有李明富、白正贵、白正富、白春山等率领之数百人，龙武、石屏、建水等县有龙永和所部以老黑山为根据地之数百人。滇桂越边境各县有蓝炳一为首之四百余人。各部均“备有极新式之武器”，正抗击蒋政府西南第二保安总队之“进剿”。建水车家寨子有马福安部，系自滇桂边境广南县转移诸地者，正与蒋军九十三旅某部对抗中。上月下旬，曾有变民部队百余人直逼个碧石铁道上之石屏县南门外，开赴县南山地，县府无力出击，只得紧闭城门。昆明西北之安宁、罗次及西南之武定等县亦有民变武装不断活动。
    【本报太岳二十五日电】洛阳附近，蒋政府苛捐杂税奇重，居民酝酿民变。据息洛阳一战区长官部，为安定市面，去岁曾大抓民夫，赶修城墙，每乡分担七十二丈长，每丈计洋七万元，全县二十四个乡共计需洋一千三百九十六万元。另外修筑城门楼五个，需洋一千六百二十五万元，要修起洛阳城，总计需一万万七千万元，于是捐税重重，加紧掠夺，每亩地每月差洋四万元，每口人（人头税）每月两千元。现洛阳附近以武装抢征，居民已是十室九空。家无颗米，吃树皮嚼草根为生。凹村（洛阳属）几家地主，被群众起而逐之，分食其满仓积米。洛阳以南有不让老财走路的，穷人们成群成伙的酝酿着：“反正不能在这里活了，不如干起来吧！”
