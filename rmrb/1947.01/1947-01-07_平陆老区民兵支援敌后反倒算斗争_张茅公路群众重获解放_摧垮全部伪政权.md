    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 3rd] The masses' armed anti-reversal struggle in the Pinglu-Zhangmao Highway area in the southern Shanxi triangle has been victorious, expanding the liberated areas behind enemy lines. Villages west of the Zhangmao Highway, such as Xiniu, Shangniu, Xiani, and Fengkou, had mobilized the masses several times before the occupation and had initially implemented land reform. After the Jiang army occupied Zhangdian, this area became behind enemy lines, isolated from the liberated areas, and reactionary landlords and local bullies rose again to harm the peasants. The five major local bullies in Xiniu Village, known as the "Five Flags," conspired to reverse the gains of the masses and had already achieved results, and they brutally harmed Niu Genmao, chairman of the Fengkou Village farmers' association, and buried five village cadres alive. Upon hearing the news, the masses in the liberated areas immediately bravely went to rescue their distressed brothers. On the 20th of last month, under the leadership of the county public security captain, more than 20 militiamen went deep behind enemy lines to carry out activities. On the evening of the 21st, they surrounded Xiniu Village and captured Zhang Quande, one of the five flags, alive, while the other four flags fled into the city in fear. On the 25th, the militiamen cut more than 20 miles of power lines on the highway, making the Jiang army, who were trapped in their strongholds, afraid to venture out of their blockhouses day and night. Since then, the masses along the Zhangmao Highway have re-launched their struggle to speak out about their sufferings, seek revenge, and reverse the reversals, destroying the puppet regime, restoring their own regime, and expanding the liberated area behind enemy lines.

    平陆老区民兵支援敌后反倒算斗争
    张茅公路群众重获解放
    摧垮全部伪政权
    【本报太岳三日电】晋南三角地带平陆张茅公路上，群众武装反倒算胜利，扩展了敌后解放区。张茅公路以西之西牛、上牛、下牛、风口等村，在沦陷前，曾经数次发动群众，已初步实行了土地改革。蒋军侵占张店后，该地已成为敌后，与解放区隔绝，反动地主恶霸复起残害农民。西牛村号称“五杆旗”的五大恶霸，阴谋倒算群众已得果实，并残害风口村农会主席牛根卯，活埋村干部五人。解放区群众闻讯后，立即奋勇前往解救灾难弟兄。上月二十日，在该县公安队长率领下，二十余个民兵深入敌后活动。二十一日黄昏，将西牛村包围，活捉五杆旗之一的张全德，其余的四杆旗皆望风逃入城内。二十五日，民兵又在公路上割去电线二十余里，更使困守据点之蒋军日夜不敢越出炮楼。此后，张茅公路群众重新展开诉苦复仇反倒算斗争，摧毁了伪政权，恢复了自己的政权，扩展了敌后解放区。
