[Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 9th] On December 30th, the Taiyue Military Sub-district issued a circular praising the Ling Shi and Yi Cheng militias for creating a new tactic of "boldly attacking the enemy's heart" and called on the militias of the entire region to learn from it. Following the previous live capture of Wu Daolong, the head of the Yan puppet "Struggle Corps," inside the enemy stronghold of Wang Cheng Village, the Ling Shi militia, on the evening of December 11th, passed through the enemy's heavy blockades of碉堡 [blockhouses] and advanced to Luzi Ping, swiftly annihilating an enemy village government office. On the spot, they killed 12 enemy village special commissioners and below, captured 6 village platoon leaders, and seized 4 rifles and 1 machine gun. Furthermore, Comrade Shen Qingmou, a militia hero from Yi Cheng, led six militiamen to raid the fourth district office of the enemy's Jiang County Da Jiao Town on December 10th, capturing the assistant and village chief on the spot, and seizing one pistol and one rifle each, and they also rushed into the enemy's "cooperative" and seized a portion of the materials. The circular pointed out: This kind of bold operation to cut into the enemy's heart and achieve brilliant results can be called a model of our militia's surprise attack tactics. The militias of the entire region should learn from them: (1) Recognize that the enemy's battle lines are extended and their troop strength is insufficient, and boldly attack the enemy's heart, learning from the Ling Yi militia's brave, decisive, and rapid actions, and their tactical creativity. (2) Learn from the Ling Yi militia's surprise attack for victory. All localities must overcome the current passive tactic of concentrating the use of militia for defense and beating, changing from passive to active, mastering the enemy's patterns of action, and actively attacking the enemy.
    
    [Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 1st] (Delayed) "One cannot catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den," This is the offensive slogan put forward by the Hong, Zhao, Lin, and Xiang militias. Hongdong blasting heroes Shang Qingfu and Huang Daoming led the militia of ××× people deep into the Lin Hong section of the Tongpu Railway line. Following the capture of a car on November 29th, on December 15th, they ambushed four Chiang Kai-shek army cars in Feng Zhang West, capturing one car on the spot, killing three enemies, and seizing three Sten submachine guns. Another militia unit intercepted an enemy car between Gan Ting and Yang Jie on the 13th, eliminating all eight people in the car and seizing two rifles. The Linfen Third District militia patrolled the Linfu Highway for three days, killing and capturing 15 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. The Xiangling militia went deep into both sides of the Lin Xiang Highway, capturing 30 enemy soldiers in just five days from the 13th to the 17th. The above five locations accounted for a total of 96 enemy killed, wounded, and captured, two cars seized, three Sten submachine guns, eight rifles, and a portion of other military supplies and documents.
