　　World Women's Federation Cables Invitation to Cai Chang and Others to Attend Council and Executive Committee Meeting
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st] The president of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Paris, Madame Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier, has cabled again, inviting Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, and Ding Ling to Prague, Czechoslovakia, to attend the Council and Executive Committee meeting to be held on February 20th. The cable stated: "We sincerely invite you to attend the meeting. Our letter of October 22nd has clarified the procedures. Please prepare a report on your association's activities and reply by cable." It is learned that Cai, Deng, and Ding immediately replied by cable, saying: "We are eager to attend the meeting. To this end, we have made mass and individual efforts, but have repeatedly been refused exit passports by the Kuomintang government, making it impossible to travel. Currently, China is in a large-scale civil war, and we are still unable to obtain passports to attend the February meeting, which is deeply regrettable."

　　世界妇联电邀蔡畅等出席理事及执委大会
    【新华社延安二十一日电】巴黎世界妇女民主联盟明发夫人来电再次邀请蔡畅、邓颖超、丁玲三人前往捷克京城布拉格出席二月二十日召开之理事兼执委大会。该电称：“我们诚恳请你们参加大会，十月二十二日函已阐明程序，请准备贵会之活动报告，并电复。”顷悉蔡、邓、丁三氏当即复电称：“我们热诚渴望能出席会议，为此我们虽曾做过群众的和个人的奋斗，但屡遭国民党政府拒发出国护照，不能成行。现时中国正在大规模内战，仍不能领得护照出席二月会议，至为遗憾。”
