　　How to Turn to the Offensive?
    ——Experiences in the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines in Anyang
    After the enemy occupied Shuiye and Guantai, the entire situation of the struggle between the enemy and us in Anyang was basically one of defense on our side and offense on the enemy's side. Later, we organized continuous attacks behind enemy lines, coordinating with the frontal resistance, and the initiative in military struggle gradually shifted to our hands.
    In the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, the main thing was to strike hard at special agents and local armed forces, and protect the interests of the masses. After we showed our strength, the masses all said, "The Eighth Route Army is back again." We exposed the rumors spread by the special agents, and our political influence expanded even further. For example, in × village, three militiamen who had fled back returned to the mountains and took up their guns to fight against the enemy. The enemy's deceptive propaganda and appeasement policies were torn apart by their own acts of extortion and plunder, and they even carried out brutal massacres, killing more than 510 people in over 300 villages. At this time, we quickly publicized and organized the masses behind enemy lines to seek revenge, and began to sow the seeds of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.
    The enemy established more than 30 puppet township governments and many "bao" in the occupied areas. Townships had "Homecoming Legions," and "bao" had "Self-Defense Corps," imposing heavy taxes and levies, all of which were placed on the liberated masses. At the same time, the despots and bullies said to the middle peasants who had not exploited the masses in the past: "In the past, you were in cahoots with the Eighth Route Army, and we didn't struggle against you, but now it's your turn." This made it even easier for me to organize the forces of all classes behind enemy lines to fight against the enemy. This also proves the correctness of our past policy of uniting with the middle peasants and not struggling against the labor-starting rich peasants in the land reform movement.
    Secondly, the development of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in Anyang struck and suppressed the worst and smallest number of despots and special agent landlords, and won over the majority of neutral landlords. After mass mobilization, the landlord class camp was weakened and internal divisions arose. There were three types of returning landlords: one was those who brought armed forces to "settle accounts" for the fruits of the mass movement; these were few. One was those who wanted things through the village head but dared not come forward. And one was those who dared not ask for anything at all. The remaining landlords also had the same three types. After our resolute strikes and suppression of the first type of people, the arrogance of the special agents was frustrated, and the "Homecoming Legions" went from dividing their forces to plunder to concentrating on garrisoning. The despots and special agent landlords went from "restoration" and "settling accounts" to moving their families to Zhangde Prefecture. Most of the landlords, on the other hand, bore heavy taxes and levies, and their hope for the "National Army" turned into disappointment. A landlord in Xiaozhai said to our cadres: "You should arrest me quickly, so I don't have to pay the levy, and it will be easier to deal with at home." The landlords in Qingyu also sent us messages asking to go up the mountain. Wu Tongfu, one of the four major landlords in Guantai, has run to the liberated area because he couldn't pay the levy. He said: "In the past, I could survive if the masses struggled against me, but now that the Kuomintang is here, I can't survive if I don't struggle. This shows how weak his social foundation is and how broad our social foundation is in contrast to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policies and our democratic policies.
    Thirdly, in order to carry out a broad struggle against the enemy, and to prevent the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and the frontal resistance from forming isolated activities that were not connected to each other, it is necessary to form a large-scale joint defense of various guerrilla corps or militiamen, to combine them with each other, to unify command, and to create a complicated situation in which they can support each other in the struggle against the enemy, so that the enemy will be attacked from both sides and will be unable to attend to one thing without neglecting the other. This is also a major reason for the development of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in Anyang.

　　如何转向主动？
    ——安阳敌后游击战经验
    敌占水冶、观台后，安阳整个敌我斗争形势，基本上我是防御，敌是进攻的。以后我们组织连续性的敌后出击，配合了正面抵抗，军事斗争上的主动，逐渐转到我手。
    敌后游击战中，主要是痛打特务地方武装，保护群众利益。我显示力量后，群众都说：“八路军就是又回来了。”揭破了特务谣言，我们的政治影响，更加扩大，如×村，跑回去的三个民兵又跑上山拿起枪来对敌斗争。敌人的欺骗宣传与怀柔政策、被他自己的勒索、掠夺的实际行为撕破了，即大肆惨杀，三百多个村，已杀掉五百一十多人。这时我迅即宣传组织敌后群众复仇，开始播下敌后游击战的种子。
    敌人在侵占区建立起三十多个伪乡公所和许多保。乡有“还乡团”，保有“自卫团”，苛重粮款，全都派到翻身群众身上。同时奸霸们对过去没有剥削过群众的中富农说：“过去你们和八路军一气，不斗争你们，现在可轮上你们了。”这就更便于我组织敌后各阶层力量，对敌进行斗争。这也证明了我们过去翻身运动中团结中农，不斗劳动起家富农政策的正确性。
    其次，安阳敌后游击战的开展，打击镇压了最坏最少的奸霸和特务地主，争取了大部分中立地主。经过群运，地主阶级阵营削弱，内部起了分化。还乡地主中有三种人，一种是带武装向群运“倒算”果实的，这不多，一种是通过保长要，而不敢出头露面的。一种是根本不敢要的。留乡地主也同样有以上三种。经过我们对第一种人的坚决打击镇压后，特务凶焰顿挫，“还乡团”由分兵抢掠到集中驻守，奸霸特务地主由“复辟”“倒算”到搬家眷往彰德府跑。大部地主则担负繁重粮款，对“国军”的盼望成了失望，小寨有一个地主对我们干部说：“你们快把我捉走，我就不用拿款了，家里也好应付。”清峪地主也给我们捎信，要求上山。观台四大地主之一的吴同福，因交不起款已跑来解放区，他说：“过去群众斗争了我我能活，国民党来了不斗争，我倒是活不成了。这说明在蒋介石反动政策与我民主政策对比下，他的社会基础是何等薄弱，而我们的社会基础又是何等的广大。
    再次为了对敌展开面的斗争，不使敌后游击战和正面抵抗形成不相联系的孤立活动，就需把各种游击兵团或民兵组成面的大联防，相互结合，统一指挥，造成对敌斗争中互相策应的错综形势，使敌腹背挨打，顾此失彼。这也是安阳敌后游击战争开展的一个主要原因。
