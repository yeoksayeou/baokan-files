Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th. The Chongqing Business Daily published a special commentary on the 22nd of last month, signed Yin Quan, criticizing the "Sino-US Treaty of Commerce." After comparing the "Sino-US Treaty of Commerce" with the Anglo-Indian relationship, the article stated: "This is really not a commercial treaty; ordinary commercial treaties mainly determine the trade tariffs between two countries, but this Sino-US Treaty of Commerce is determining the nature of China's economy. In terms of content, the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce is the United States accomplishing in one battle what Britain had been operating (invading) in India for two and a half centuries. If this commercial treaty can be implemented smoothly, China's economic status will not be higher than India's."

The article then provided a specific analysis of the current state of the Chinese economy under American control: First, the widespread and in-depth industrial input of the United States into China is a blitzkrieg that sweeps away our modern industry, handicrafts, and domestic commerce. Second, what American finance wants to establish in China is a thorough military base economy. "Because American financial capital is invested in military and political aspects, it seizes any resources (such as lead, aluminum, oil, etc.) and undertakings (such as aviation, shipping, etc.) that have military strategic value as a priority. Under this premise, American financial capital only creates military strategic base industries. China's loans from the United States are also a huge amount, and how to repay the debt in the future is a big problem. Leasing out minerals in the form of 'technical cooperation' does not earn money, only relying on the export of agricultural products and raw materials. The task of this Sino-US agricultural cooperation group is to investigate our ability to repay debts and improve our ability to repay debts. However, commodity prices are in the hands of foreigners, and the initiative is in the hands of foreigners. Therefore, from now on, our country has to work and repay debts for generations."

The article finally concluded: "American monopoly capital uses finance to seize politics, uses industrial products to seize the market, and then uses commerce to collect debts, using all of this to seize the Chinese people. Therefore, the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce is expressed very vaguely. Only by being abstract can it encompass everything. This is a program, and based on this program, countless unequal treaties can be produced."

    抨击蒋美商约
    它若能安然实行，中国经济地位将不如印度。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】重庆商务日报于上月二十二日发表一署名印泉之专论，批评“中美商约”。该文在将“中美商约”与英印关系相比较之后称：“这实在不是商约；普通商约主要确定两国贸易税则，这次中美商约却在确定中国经济的性质。按内容来讲，中美商约是美国把英国在印度两个半世纪的经营（侵略）在中国‘毕其功于一役’。这次商约如能安然实行，中国经济地位并不比印度高超。”该文继对美国控制下之中国经济现势加以具体分析；第一、美国对华普遍深入之工业输入，此以闪击式扫荡我们的现代工业、手工业和国内商业。第二、美国金融在中国所要建立的将是彻头彻尾的军事基地经济。“因为美国金融资本都投在军事和政治方面，凡是有军略性的资源（如铅、铝、石油等）和事业（如航空、航业等），都尽先抓住。在这种前提之下，美国金融资本所创造的只是军略基地工业。中国向美国的贷款，也是一笔巨大的数目，将来怎么还债是个大问题。矿产以“技术合作”方式租让出去，是赚不到钱的，只有靠农产品和原料输出。这次中美农业合作团的任务，就是考察我们的还债能力，并提高我们的还债能力。可是，商品价格是在在外国人手里，主动权操外国人手里。所以，从此我国得世世代代做工还债。该文最后总结称：“美国垄断资本用金融抓住政治，用工业品抓住市场，再用商业来讨债，利用这一切来抓住中国人民。所以，中美商约就表现得很笼统。唯其抽象，才能包括万象。这是一个纲领，根据这个纲领，就可以产生出无数不平等条约。”
