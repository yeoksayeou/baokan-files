　　Yang Chairman Speaks Again
    Calls on Residents Along the River to Arm Themselves for Self-Defense
　　Denounces Chiang Kai-shek for Unauthorized Release of Yellow River Water to Flood Our Liberated Areas; Xinhua News Agency Reporter Exposes Central News Agency's Shameless Rumors
    [This Newspaper Special Dispatch] Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, issued another statement regarding Chiang Kai-shek's decision to breach the dyke and release water at Huayuankou, calling on residents along the river to heighten their vigilance, step up self-defense and self-rescue efforts, and calling on the military and civilians throughout the region to vigorously provide support. Chairman Yang first pointed out: This is a matter of life and death for the people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area. Based on the lessons of the past year, Chiang and the US’s determination and conspiracy are about fake negotiations and real water release. Although the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) representatives in the Handan negotiations agreed to postpone the breach and water release at Huayuankou for five months, the raging Yellow River water has already flowed into our area since December 28th, when the Chiang side violated the agreement and unilaterally released water from the diversion channel. Several days after the negotiations ended, they still showed no sign of stopping the water release. Furthermore, the Kuomintang side has recently been clamoring and wantonly slandering the liberated areas, proving that they have no sincerity whatsoever in implementing the verbal agreement reached in Handan. The unprecedented Yellow River flood disaster is even more seriously threatening the seven million residents along the river. The residents along the river cannot sit idly by and wait for their death. A broader armed self-defense and self-rescue movement should be launched immediately, and the military and civilians throughout the border region should urgently and effectively support our innocent compatriots who are about to suffer this land-sinking disaster.
    [This Newspaper Special Dispatch] The Chiang Kai-shek government forcibly released water at Huayuankou, flooding the residents of the former course of the Yellow River to the east. A Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th even used lies that defied the facts, such as "The former course of the Yellow River is desolate and sparsely populated," attempting to mitigate the responsibility for its heinous crimes. A Xinhua News Agency reporter refuted this, stating: There are 1,700 newly built villages and towns in the former course of the Yellow River, with 600,000 residents living in the riverbed and seven million residents along the river. This is a universally known fact. In previous Yellow River negotiations, the relocation fees for residents in the riverbed were calculated based on this number. At the same time, the UNRRA headquarters has sent personnel to inspect the riverine areas of the Liberated Zone. On August 23rd and 24th of last year, Mr. Wang Hecheng of the UNRRA office in Heze, after inspecting the situation of residents in the Nanhua riverbed in Juancheng, stated, "The situation of the residents in the riverbed is indeed much worse than what is written in the reports. Relief and relocation fees should be allocated as early as possible before the water release so that residents do not suffer from the flood." Mr. Wang also took photographs of the real situation and brought them back. With both human witnesses and physical evidence, the Central News Agency's attempt to cover up Chiang Kai-shek's crime of releasing water and sabotaging the Handan verbal agreement, and to deceive the people of the world, is truly ridiculous, shameful, and a futile attempt to conceal the truth!

　　杨主席再度发表谈话
    号召沿河居民武装自救
  　痛斥蒋介石擅放黄水淹我解放区新华社记者揭穿中央社无耻造谣
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府杨秀峰主席为蒋介石在花园口堵口放水，再度发表谈话，号召沿河居民提高警觉，加紧自卫自救，并号召全区军民奋力支援。杨主席首先指出：这是冀鲁豫解放区人民的生死问题，由于过去一年的教训，蒋美的决心和阴谋是假谈判真放水。虽然邯郸谈判中联总代表已同意延缓五个月堵口放水，但事实上自十二月廿八日蒋方违约擅自将引河放水后，滚滚黄水已流入我区。谈判结束数日，还不见他们有停止放水的表示。而国民党方面最近更大肆叫嚣对解放区横加诬蔑，证明其对于实行邯郸口头协议，没有丝毫诚意。空前的黄水大灾已更严重地威胁着沿河七百万居民。沿河居民不能坐以待毙。应马上发动更广大的武装自卫自救运动，全边区的军民应该紧急有效地支援我们将要遭此陆沉大祸的无辜同胞。
    【本报特讯】蒋介石政府强行在花园口放水，东淹黄河故道居民，现水头已流过荷泽。中央社七日电讯，竟以“黄河故道一片荒凉极少人烟”一类违背事实之谎言，妄图减轻其凶毒罪行的责任，新华社记者予以驳斥称：黄河故道，新建村镇一千七百个，河床居民六十万，沿河居民七百万，这是举世周知的事实，历次黄河谈判，河床居民迁移费皆按此数字计算，同时联总行总曾先后派员到解放区沿河地带视察。去年八月二十三、四两日，行总驻荷泽办事处王贺宸氏，在视察鄄城南华河床居民情形后，曾谓“河床居民情形确比报告中所写的更苦得多，放水前应尽早拨发救济迁移费，不应使居民遭受水灾”。王氏并将真实情况摄影带回，人证俱在，中央社掩饰蒋介石放水罪行，破坏邯郸口头协议，竟想一手遮尽天下耳目，真是可笑可耻欲盖弥彰了！
