    Overcoming "Good Enough" Thinking, Launching a Competition to Drive Forward Laggards
    Half of Changzhi Villages Complete Land Reform
    Now Concentrating Efforts to Achieve County-Wide Balance
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 26th] Among the 166 villages in Changzhi County, half have completed land reform, and the movement is deepening. Most of the remaining villages are in a high tide. The county was a newly liberated area recovered after the Shangdang self-defense campaign in September the year before last. Last spring, it underwent a relatively thorough rent reduction movement. When this land reform movement began in mid-December last year, each district generally trained village cadres and activists to break their "good enough" thinking with the new standard of "land to the tiller." According to statistics from the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts over the past month, peasants have recovered more than 20,000 mu of land, more than 10,000 rooms, 345 head of livestock, and some clothing. At the beginning of the movement, the county leadership paid attention to educating and transforming past cadres and activists, making them conduct self-criticism to the masses, returning the fruits they had gained excessively in the past, and breaking their protection of landlords. For example, more than 20 cadres and activists in Tianhe Village who had been bought off by landlords became aware and led the struggle; at the same time, attention was paid to mobilizing middle peasants and all kinds of "backward" peasants. Activists extensively colluded, visited the miserable, and launched a competition to mobilize the "backward," which yielded great results. All 230-plus backward elements in Yincheng and other three villages became active, and Xinyi Village promoted these new activists into the village's leadership group. Mobilizing women in Sudian and other places also achieved great results. Small pseudo-cadres who had "washed their faces and blackened themselves" in last year's movement and had not dared to speak since were also absorbed into the struggle. After the "backward" masses were mobilized, many hidden properties of the landlords were unearthed (the Third District alone discovered more than 6,000 mu of hidden land), truly achieving a total offensive by all peasants against feudal landlords. Only a very few villages were in the initial stage of mobilization. At the inspection meeting in the first ten days of this month, Wang Zongqi, secretary of the county party committee, especially called on all cadres in the county not to be complacent and to thoroughly complete the land reform throughout the county before the spring ploughing. He proposed: "Complacency is equal to protecting feudal despots." The movement is now being pushed to a comprehensive high tide, moving towards balance.

    克服“差不多”思想展开发动落后竞赛
    长治半数村完成土地改革
    现正集中力量争取全县平衡
    【本报长治廿六日电】长治全县一百六十六村中半数村庄已完成土地改革，运动走向深入，其余大部村庄正在高潮中。该县为前年九月上党自卫战役后收复的新解放区，去春曾经过比较深入的减租运动。此次土地改革运动于去年十二月中旬开始时，各区均普遍训练了村干部与积极分子，以耕者有其田的新标准，打破了他们的“差不多”思想。一月来据三、四、五三个区统计，农民已收回土地两万余亩，房万余间，牲口三百四十五头及衣物一部。运动开始，该县领导上注意了教育与改造过去的干部和积极分子，使其向群众作自我批评，退出了过去多得果实与打破对地主的包庇。如天河村二十余被地主收买的干部与积极分子又觉悟过来，领导了这次的斗争；同时注意了发动中农与各种各样的“落后”农民。以积极分子广泛地串通、访苦、展开发动“落后”的竞赛，收效很大。荫城等三村所有二百三十多落后分子都积极起来，信义村并把这种新积极分子提进了该村的领导集团。苏店等地发动妇女亦获很大成绩。各村在去年运动中曾经洗脸擦黑，至今不敢说话的小伪干部也被吸收参加了斗争。“落后”群众发动后，发掘出地主隐藏财物甚多（仅三区即发现隐藏的土地六千余亩），真正作到了全体农民对封建地主的总进攻。只有极少数村处于发动的初期。县委王宗琪在本月上旬检查会上特号召全县干部不要自满，一定要在春耕以前彻底完成全县的土地改革。提出：“自满即等于包庇了封建恶霸”。现运动正推向全面高潮，走向平衡。
