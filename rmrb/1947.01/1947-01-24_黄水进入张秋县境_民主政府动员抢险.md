The Yellow River entered Zhangqiu County on the 19th, at an average speed of 3.5 *li* per hour. There is a breach of eight *zhang* wide in the levee between Nantao Chengpu and Shiqiao in Zhangqiu; due to the lack of materials in the past, no work has been done. The waterhead could flow to that location in just thirty hours, causing great fear among the local masses. Our Zhangqiu Democratic Government mobilized the masses overnight on the 19th to go and block the breach, and is currently rushing repairs with sorghum stalks and other materials. The levees of the Li Cuimo and Zhang Jiyang tributaries in the Seventh District of Shouzhang were destroyed by the enemy and have not been repaired at all, and the water flowing into these two tributaries is extremely turbulent. The Shouzhang Democratic Government has mobilized the local masses to work day and night on rescue efforts.

　　黄水进入张秋县境
    民主政府动员抢险
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】黄水于十九日进入张秋县境，平均速度每小时三里半。张秋南陶城埠至石桥间之堤岸有八丈宽的缺口一处，过去因无工料全未动工。仅须三十小时水头即可流到该处，当地群众万分恐惧。我张秋民主政府，十九日连夜发动群众前往堵补缺口，现正以秫秸等物抢修中。寿张七区李萃莫与张际阳二支流之堤岸被敌破坏，全未修筑，流入此二支流之水势极为汹涌。寿张民主政府已动员当地群众，日夜兴工抢险。
