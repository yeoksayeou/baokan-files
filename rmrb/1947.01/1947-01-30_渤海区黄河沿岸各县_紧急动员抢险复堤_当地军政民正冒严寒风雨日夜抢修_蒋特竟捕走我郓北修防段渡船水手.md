    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 28th – Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians in eleven counties including Jiyang, Qingcheng, Putai, Lijin, and Qidong along the Yellow River in the Bohai Liberated Area have been urgently mobilized to engage in emergency dike repair projects to thwart Chiang Kai-shek's plot to flood the Liberated Areas. There are forty-three dangerous sections in the Bohai region. Due to harassment by Chiang's troops and special agents, assassinations of Communist dike repair personnel, and other sabotage, very little of the project has been completed. The estimated cost of materials needed is 7 billion legal tender. In Putai County alone, there are four dangerous sections, totaling twelve *hua li* in length, requiring more than 3 billion legal tender and 21,600 bricks. According to the Shandong Liberated Area River Affairs Bureau's plan, the county's project would take seven months to complete. Unexpectedly, Chiang's side is now blocking the river and releasing water. Currently, the people and democratic government workers are braving the severe cold, wind, and rain, working day and night to carry out repairs.

    Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 29th – On the night of the 20th of this month, a boatman from the Wangyazi ferry crossing in the Yunbei section on the south bank of the Yellow River was captured by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. That night, when the ferry of the Flood Prevention Section was ferrying people at the Wangyazi ferry crossing, more than twenty people on the north bank suddenly pretended to be Eighth Route Army soldiers and called for the boat to cross the river. Immediately, a boat set out for the north bank, and two boatmen went ashore to greet them. The twenty-odd special agents immediately pulled back their gun bolts and rushed forward. One boatman, seeing the situation was not good, immediately returned to the boat and sped to the south bank. The special agents fired shots at the boat, fortunately without causing injuries. Another boatman was unfortunately captured. The masses along the river are extremely angry about this and have now organized militia and self-defense teams to be on guard and patrol.

    蒋特竟捕走我郓北修防段渡船水手
    【新华社山东二十八日电】渤海解放区黄河沿岸济阳、青城、蒲台、利津、齐东等十一个县数十万军民紧急动员起来，投入抢险复堤工程，以粉碎蒋介石水淹解放区的阴谋。渤海全区险工达四十三处，由于蒋军及特务骚扰，暗杀中共方面复堤人员及其他种种破坏阻挠，致完成工程很少。目前所需工料预计达法币七十亿元。以蒲台而论，全县共险工四处，中达十二华里，需用法币三十余亿元，用砖二万一千六百余块。依山东解放区河务局计划，该县工程需七个月始能完成，不料蒋方现在即堵口放水。现人民及民主政府工作员正冒严寒风雨，日夜进行抢修。
    【 本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】本月二十日夜间，黄河南岸郓北段王鸭子渡口水手一名，遭蒋记特务抓去。该夜，修防段之渡船于王鸭子渡口摆渡时，北岸忽有二十余人冒充八路军战士，唤船渡河。当即有一只船摆向北岸，并有二水手上岸迎接，该二十余特务立即拉开枪拴，一拥上前；一水手见势不妙，当即回船疾驶南岸。特务鸣枪向该船射击，幸未负伤，另一水手不幸被捕去。沿河群众对此极为愤恨，现已组织民兵与自卫队戒备巡察。
