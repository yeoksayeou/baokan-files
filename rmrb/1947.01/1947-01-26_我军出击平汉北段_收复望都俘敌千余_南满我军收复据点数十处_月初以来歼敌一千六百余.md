Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 24th: The Eighth Route Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway once again recovered Wangdu County and Wangjing Railway Station on the Pinghan line on the 21st of this month. Most of the Third Regiment and one battalion of the Second Regiment of the pseudo-Hou Ruyong unit of Chiang's Fifth Army were annihilated. It is estimated that over a thousand people, including Qu Wangchun, the commander of the Third Regiment, were captured alive. The results of the battle are still being tallied. Wangdu was occupied by Chiang's army on November 12th of last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: The anti-nibbling struggle in Southern Manchuria continues to achieve victories: (1) On the 2nd, Chiang's army's 195th Division launched an attack on Sidaojiang, Liudaojiang and other places north of Tonghua, but was repelled by the Democratic Allied Army, which immediately seized the opportunity to recover strongholds such as Jiapigou and Dulanzi. The invading army suffered losses of over 500 men. (2) The local armed forces of the Democratic Allied Army, which persisted in guerrilla warfare in the Fushun, Liuhe and other regions, successively recovered 34 strongholds including Xuezi Mountain, Sandaogou (south of Liuhe), Fumin Village (southeast of Huinan County), Taipingshao, Yongdian, Dadianzi, Riqing Bay, and Dianzi (under Fushun) in the anti-nibbling battles since this month. 333 enemy soldiers below the battalion commander were killed or wounded, 760 were captured, and 10 light and heavy machine guns and 368 rifles were seized.
