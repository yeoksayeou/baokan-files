    Taiyue Frontline Reporter Points Out
    What to Learn from Jiao Wubao?
    Usually lead by example, remain calm and brave, and conduct current affairs education for new soldiers.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue Frontline, 8th dispatch] As a large number of liberated peasants poured into the People's Liberation Army, Jiao Wubao educated new soldiers in actual combat, allowing them to quickly learn to fight and win battles. This has a great effect on winning the war. Now the leaders of the Taiyue Military Region are calling for a widespread Jiao Wubao campaign. A frontline reporter wrote a commentary stating: Jiao Wubao is one of the thousands of heroic model figures in the People's Liberation Army. The combat mutual aid group he leads is the best form of organization and working method for improving the combat effectiveness of the troops. The people in the liberated areas have already had war training in the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the one year of the Self-Defense War. However, when participating in regular army operations, they still lack a set of tactics for mobile warfare and siege warfare. If countless Jiao Wubaos appear in our troops, and the veteran soldiers in the regular army can implement battlefield mutual assistance like Jiao Wubao, then new soldiers can learn to fight and win battles as soon as they arrive in the troops, which will increase the guarantee for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war.
    What should we learn from Jiao Wubao?
    First, Jiao Wubao can usually lead by example, patiently helping and caring for new soldiers in terms of ideology, life, and on the training ground. He has a high reputation among the new soldiers, so the new soldiers can believe what he says in wartime. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize that wartime work is a concentrated manifestation of peacetime work.
    Second, as a leader, he must be calm and brave himself in order to call others to be calm and brave. Jiao Wubao is not only brave but also resourceful, has combat experience, and is alert and flexible in his movements, which can protect the safety of new soldiers and reduce casualties in the troops.
    Third, Jiao Wubao is a political worker who can immediately grasp the enemy's weaknesses, explain the situation to new soldiers, and conduct political work on the battlefield such as education and mobilization, which is the most practical.
    Fourth, Jiao Wubao is a capable assistant to the commander. He can help the commander grasp the troops on the battlefield.

    太岳前线记者指出
    向焦五保学习什么？
    平时以身作则，沉着勇敢带头，对新战士进行时事教育。
    【本报太岳前线八日电】当大量翻身农民涌入人民解放军的时候，焦五保在实战中教育新战士，让他们迅速学会打仗，并且打胜仗，这对争取战争胜利有很大作用。现太岳军区首长号召普遍展开焦五保运动。前线记者著文评论称：焦五保是人民解放军千万英雄模范人物中的一个，他所领导的战斗互助组，是提高部队战斗力最好的一种组织形式和工作方法。解放区人民在八年抗日战争和一年自卫战争中已经有了战争的锻炼，可是当参加正规军作战的时候，他们还缺乏运动战和攻坚战的一套战法。如果我们部队中出现无数个焦五保，正规军中的老战士都能像焦五保一样实行战场互助，新战士一到部队就可以学会打仗，并且打胜仗，那对爱国自卫战争的胜利更增加了一分保障。
    我们向焦五保学习什么呢？
    第一、焦五保在平时便能以身作则，在思想上、生活上、操场上都耐心的帮助和爱护新战士，在新战士中威信很高，所以在战时新战士才能相信他的话，因此要认识战时工作即是平时工作的集中表现。
    第二、作为一个带头者，本身就要沉着勇敢，才能叫别人沉着勇敢，焦五保不只有勇而有谋，有战斗经验，动作机警灵活，能保护新战士的安全，减少部队伤亡。
    第三、焦五保是一个政治工作者，能即时抓住敌人弱点，给新战士解释情况，进行教育鼓动等战场上的政治工作，是最切合实际的。
    第四、焦五保是指挥员的得力助手，他能帮助指挥员在战场上掌握部队。
