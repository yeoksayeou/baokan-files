    U.S. Military's Rape of Female Student Ignites National Outrage
    All Sectors Support Student Protest Movement
    Students in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Other Places Strengthen Connections for Unified Action

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 31st (Delayed): Shanghai news: Eleven organizations, including the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Association, issued a declaration protesting the U.S. military's atrocities and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China, believing that "apologies and compensation are absolutely insufficient; as long as the U.S. military remains, the atrocities will not cease." The Shanghai Chinese Women's Association New Year's Party also issued a letter of protest: "Resolutely advocate for the departure of U.S. troops from China!" Pan Jinong asked: "Those 'masters' who say 'the American army was invited by us,' did they also invite them to rape female students and beat drivers to death?" Wu Zuguang believed: "The government that indulges them is the one who should be held responsible." Chen Yanzhao rebuked the Americans: "Your military deployment in China will lead to bitter consequences! When this bomb explodes, you won't be able to escape yourselves!" Xu Chi shouted repeatedly: "U.S. troops, get out! Get out! Get out!" Zhang Zhengyu also angrily exclaimed: "U.S. troops, get out!"
    Shanghai Wenhui Daily published an editorial entitled "We Protest with Grief," stating: "We cannot understand why the Chinese government repeatedly turns a blind eye to the U.S. military's brutal behavior, failing to intervene and instead protecting them in every matter. The U.S. side has repeatedly released the perpetrators, while suppressing the people's protests, even forbidding the victims to cry out, seek justice, or resist. What good is this government to the people?" The newspaper pointed out: "The only solution is for the U.S. military to leave China immediately."
    According to Nanjing news: Nanjing's civilian newspapers also protested the incident. The *Nanjing Renbao* published the news of the atrocity as a front-page headline and immediately published a commentary stating: "Now that the task of sending Japanese prisoners of war back is completed, why not let them return, and instead leave them behind to commit these beastly acts?" The *Xinmin Bao* and *Dagang Bao* also attached great importance to the news, placing it in prominent positions. The Kuomintang's *Heping Ribao* did not publish a word about the incident. When reporters from various newspapers inquired about the feelings of Kuomintang dignitaries on the matter, they all refused to express their opinions, even saying: "Such things often happen in our country as well."
    Shanghai Minmeng leaders issued statements to the press, demanding the departure of U.S. troops from China. More than one hundred figures from the cultural world, including Ma Yinchu, Ma Zongrong, Ye Shengtao, Tian Han, Pan Jinong, and from the women's world, including Liao Mengxing, Jing Song, Ge Qin, An E, Hu Ziying, Feng Zi, and others, published their opinions in the newspapers, unanimously advocating for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. Ma Yinchu questioned the government: "Is this really a government of the Chinese people? Ashamed of the people of the country, what face do they have to occupy high positions!?"

    美军强奸女生兽行激起全国义愤
    各界支援学生抗议运动
    沪杭等地各校学生加强联系一致行动
    【本报综合报导】北平美军强奸女大学生事件的消息传至各地后，不只是各校学生罢课游行示威抗议，民盟领袖、人民团体、文化界、妇女界、新闻界及各大学教授也都义愤填膺，大声疾呼，表示全力支持各地学生的抗议运动。
    据新华社南京三十一日电（迟到）上海消息：上海人民团体联合会等十一团体发表宣言，抗议美军暴行，并要求撤退驻华美军，认为“绝非道歉赔偿所能了事，美军一日不去，暴行即一日不止。”沪中国妇女联谊会新岁同乐会亦发出抗议书：“坚决主张美军离华！”潘孑农问：“那些说‘美国军队是我们请来的’的‘老爷’们，他们强奸女学生打死车夫也是请来的吗？”吴祖光以为：“该负责任的是我们的放手成性的政府”。陈烟桥斥美国人：“你们在中国驻军将自食恶果！等到这颗炸弹炸开时，你们自己也跑不了！”徐迟连喊：“美军滚！滚！滚！”张正宇也愤然直呼：“美军滚出去！”
    上海文汇报发表题为“我们沉痛抗议”的社论，内称：“我们不能理解中国政府对美军残暴行为何以一再熟视无睹，不加过问，反而遇事庇护。美方多方为凶犯罪首开释，而对人民的抗议行为却横加压抑，甚至不许受害的人民喊叫，不许申冤，更不许反抗，那人民有何贵乎这一个政府？”该报指出：“唯一解决的办法是美军立即离华。”
    据南京消息：南京民间报纸对此事也纷纷抗议，《南京人报》将此项暴行消息以头条登出，立即著论称：“遣送日俘任务既告完成，为什么不让他们回去，却要留下做这些野兽行为？”新民报及大刚报对这消息也很重视，都登在显著地位。国民党的和平日报对此事则只字不登。国民党要人们当各报记者询问对此事之感想时，都拒绝表示意见。甚至说：“这样的事情在我国也时常发生。”
    上海民盟领袖向报界发表谈话，要求美军离华。文化界马寅初、马宗融、叶圣陶、田汉、潘孑农等，及妇女界廖梦醒、景宋、葛琴、安娥、胡子婴、凤子等百余人，同于报上发表意见，一致主张美军应立即撤退。马寅初质问政府：“到底是不是中国人的政府？愧对国人，还有什么面目盘据高位！？”
