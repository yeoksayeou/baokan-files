Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Associated Press, Frankfurt: U.S. Military Governor of Germany, McNarney, announced the pardon of "800,000 minor Nazis" shortly before Christmas. McNarney also said that the United States had no intention of retaliation against Germany and promised to improve the German economic situation. According to United Press, some people in the German Army Department believe that Military Governor McNarney's pardon order is a "friendly policy toward Germany," which is actually a policy of shielding German Nazis. To loudly shout about implementing democracy in Germany, while in practice releasing Nazis in large numbers, is another manifestation of inconsistent words and deeds.

    美国袒护德国战犯
    竟释放纳粹八十万
    【新华社延安五日电】美联社佛兰克福讯：德境美占领军司令麦克纳尼，于圣诞节前夕宣布赦免“小纳粹八十万名”。麦氏又谓：美国对德国无报复意念，并允改善德国经济局势。据合众社宣称：德陆军部若干人士之意见，美占领军司令麦克纳尼之赦免令乃“对德友善政策”，实为庇护德国纳粹的政策。口头上高喊要在德国实行民主，在实际上则大批释放纳粹，这又是言行不符的表现。
