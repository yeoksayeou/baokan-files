    Within the Kuomintang, which controls the entire Nanjing Central Government, there are many factions vying for power and profit for personal gain. However, in terms of China's future development, the only meaningful division is between the dominant right wing and the politically weak liberal wing. Some ordinary Kuomintang members also regret the civil war and hope for peaceful construction, but they are extremely cautious when expressing their views and are terrified of the ruling elements.

    From a direct analysis of the situation in Nanjing, it is clear that the leading figures in the Nanjing government who most strongly advocate openly confronting the CCP are Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu (the pillars of the Kuomintang), Bai Chongxi (Minister of National Defense), Chen Cheng (Chief of Staff), and Gu Zhutong (Commander-in-Chief of the Army). It is very difficult to get the right-wing leaders to express their opinions directly to the press, but they sometimes express themselves very frankly on individual issues. Moreover, well-informed sources who disagree with them can explain the ideas of the right-wing leaders without hesitation. From various sources, it is not difficult to draw a complete picture of the Kuomintang ruling group, although this picture may not perfectly match everyone's thoughts in detail.

    The main argument of the extreme conservatives is very simple. They say: "We cannot wait. War is not good, but the current political, economic, and military stalemate is even worse." In this way, they attempt to prove to groups that oppose war or are wavering that the civil war is right. Since they desire construction, they must break this stalemate. When asked whether the Communists can be defeated quickly, they reply that it can be concluded in two to six months. They argue that although the Communists possess excellent weapons they have never had before, they were defeated in Sipingjie in the Northeast. Inside the passes, unless they occasionally obtain some weapons from the Kuomintang army, they have no place to acquire weapons. As for the hope of a peaceful settlement, they say: "Even if there is an agreement, it will be useless. Besides, there won't be any agreement."

    In reality, it is doubtful whether these warmongering group leaders truly believe, after years of experience, that defeating the Communists will be so quick. They probably hope to drive the Communists out of the railway areas and certain strategic strongholds in North and Central China in a short campaign. This could be used as a basis for peace negotiations, but after consolidation, a new campaign would follow to attack the areas still occupied by the Communists. This is a risky policy, alternating between talks and fighting, or more correctly, proceeding simultaneously with varying degrees of emphasis at different times.

    However, these warlords have not realistically assessed their own strength, because they base their strategy on the hope that a Soviet-American war will occur in the next few years. An official who opposed the civil war told me that the military camp can be divided into two groups: the first group believes that the civil war is certain, but not from the perspective of Soviet-American relations. These people are often high-ranking generals or lower-ranking officers in the provinces, that is, those who are on the front lines of the actual civil war. Some people simply regard the civil war as a grain grab or disruption of the autumn harvest in the Communist areas. The second group is deeply aware of Soviet-American relations and believes that if there is a civil war in China, the United States and the Soviet Union will truly fight. It is said that this group includes most of the senior generals. What is particularly important is that these people are not simply passive beneficiaries of a Soviet-American war; they regard the Soviet-American war caused by the threat of civil war as their own benefit.

    Among those who oppose the civil war are people such as Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Shao Lizi, an important figure in the KMT-CPC negotiations. These people know that if the civil war continues to spread, China's economic problems will become very serious. There are also military personnel including Feng Yuxiang and others. Although there are more differences among these people than in the tightly knit right-wing group, a complete picture of their opinions can also be drawn. Although there are a considerable number of liberals, more than generally imagined in the United States, they have one thing in common: a lack of decisive power. Regardless of how high their position, the literati are just individuals in the reactionary sea, and the progressive military men have long been deprived of their military power by the government in the past.

    They oppose the civil war for economic reasons, believing that the expansion of military conflict will cause extreme chaos. An economic official told me: "I know how businessmen feel... Once true peace is achieved, most of our difficulties can be solved." Song Ziwen's position is somewhat ambiguous. Undoubtedly, he fears civil war, but at the same time, he promotes the economic countermeasures necessary for the civil war—such as collecting grain in lieu of land tax—and obtains greater assistance from the United States for the government ruled by warlords.

    The Kuomintang liberals and the warlords have sharp differences on the possibility of defeating the Communists. They believe that even if the Communist troops are expelled from some railway areas and strategic strongholds, they can still advance in any place. Moreover, the liberals believe that the value of any individual success is far less than the result of weakening the government due to large-scale war. They think that after five or six months, the Communist problem will still be the same in China. One of them told me: "China loves peace and democracy, but does not need communism. If the war continues, the Communists will not be eliminated. If the war and chaos continue, there will be more Communists."

    The liberals and the warlords also have different views on the future of Soviet-American relations. They believe that the right-wing elements are miscalculating. Most people believe that the United States will continue to aid the central government in the civil war, some believe that it will stop, or express doubt. But all believe that even if there is a Soviet-American war, it will be much further away than the warlords expect. An official said to me during an interview: "Stalin is a straightforward person. If the United States thinks the Soviet Union is advancing too much, and it seems that a war is about to happen, he will give way. Maybe there will be a war in fifteen or twenty years, but it will not be soon."

    Another liberal very firmly told me: "The warlords believe that continuing the civil war will incite a Soviet-American conflict. They think that this will strengthen their dictatorial and autocratic power in China. This is a strange fantasy of theirs. I don't think there will be a Soviet-American war. It is true that there are contradictions between the Soviet Union and the United States, but the people of both countries do not want war." Generally, Kuomintang liberals advocate close relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. They do not want to make China a battlefield for the two powers, but hope to be extremely friendly with both sides and carry out peaceful construction.

    In this situation, one of the key issues is to determine Chiang Kai-shek's attitude. One rarely hears his opinions. This is partly because the head of government is often farther away from the people than his subordinates, and partly because in China, this government does not have the need to explain the platform to the people in detail. But one fact should not be mistaken, that is, Chiang Kai-shek is the ruling figure of the government, above everyone else. For example, people often discuss or predict the attitude of Marshall or the CCP representative Zhou Enlai, but no one asks what the government representative Xu Yongchang thinks. This is worth noting. The reason is very simple: everyone knows that only Chiang Kai-shek's thoughts count.

    Chiang Kai-shek's thoughts can also be inferred from the actions of his subordinates, and from the very harsh conditions that he personally submitted to Marshall in mid-June for transmission to the CCP. It is generally believed that taxes will be paid in cash in the future, but Chiang Kai-shek personally decided to collect land tax in kind. It is also known to everyone. Collecting taxes in kind is for the purpose of obtaining grain from farmers to feed the army. Judging from various facts, Chiang Kai-shek's point of view has long been the right-wing point of view. It is probably reasonable to conclude that he himself and the warmongers in the Nanjing government and the Kuomintang are one and the same.

    Although the stated policy of the United States is conditional, that is, to aid China to the extent that China achieves peaceful, democratic unification, the key to the development of the situation is in the hands of the US government, because US material aid strengthens the faction advocating civil war. The mutual actions of the Kuomintang's two wings, the Communist Party, the liberal elements of the Third Party, and non-party figures are mostly within the framework of US policy. This places a special responsibility on the United States, making it even more important that US policy effectively promotes internal peace rather than expanding the Chinese civil war.

### 中国军阀的赌博

　　中国军阀的赌博
    罗辛格著  刘柯译
    罗辛格是美国的远东问题专家，外交政策汇报和新共和杂志的撰稿人，去年七月曾访问延安，后又来本区视察黄河故道，在美记者中观点比较公正。
        ——编者
    在控制整个南京中央政府之国民党内部，有许多派系，彼此为个人而争权夺利。但要以中国将来之发展来说，唯一有意义的分歧是占统治地位之右翼与政治上脆弱的自由主义之一翼的分歧。国民党普通党员在这两翼之间，也有一些领袖人物对内战表示惋惜而希望和平建设，但在说他们的观点时，极端谨慎，对统治分子非常骇怕。
    从南京形势的直接分析中，就可明显的看出，南京政府的领袖人物最主张对中共明张旗鼓来干的是陈立夫、陈果夫（国民党之台柱）、白崇禧（国防部长）、陈诚（参谋总长）及顾祝同（陆军总司令）等。要想使右翼领袖人物直接对报界明白表示他们的意见，非常困难，但他们在个别的问题上，有时表示得非常坦白。并且，不同意他们的消息灵通人士则可毫不迟疑的说明右派领袖人物的想法。从各方消息来源，都不难画出国民党统治集团之全貌，虽则这个图画不见得对每一个人的想法在细节上都能吻合。
    极端保守分子主要论据也十分简单。他们说：“我们不能等待。打仗不好，但现在这种政治、经济及军事上的僵局连续下去，更不好。”他们以此种方法企图向反对战争或动摇的集团证明内战是对的，他们既然愿望建设，就得打破这种僵局。当问道共产党是否很快便可打败时，他们就会答复说，两个月到六个月就可结束。他们辩说，共产党虽具备他们向所未有的优良武器，但在东北败于四平街，在关里除非有时从国民党军队得到一些武器外，他们没有获得武器的地方。至于对和平解决的希望，他们说：“即使有协定，也无用处。何况，也不会有什么协定。”
    实际上，可疑的是这些好战集团的领袖们，在多年经验之后，是否真正相信打败共产党会如是之快。他们大概是希望在短促的战役中，把共产党逐出华北华中的铁路区域和某些战略据点之外。这或者作为和平谈判之基础，但在巩固以后，便再接着来一次新的战役，进攻仍为共产党占有之地区。这是一种冒险的政策，谈和打互相交替，或者更正确一点说，是在同时进行只是在不同的时间，有不同程度的重点。
    可是，这些军阀们并未实实在在估计一下他们自己的力量，因为他们把最近几年内即可发生苏美战争的希望作为他们战略的基础。一个反对内战的官吏对我说，军人阵营里可以分成两个集团：第一种人相信内战是确定的，但不是从苏美关系来着眼的。这些人常常是各省的高级将领或下级军官，也就是处在实际内战前线上的。也有些人只简单的把内战当作对共产党地区的抢粮或扰乱秋收。第二种人是深深的意识到苏美关系，并且认为假如中国有内战，美国和苏联就真会打起来。据说这一集团包括大多数的高级将领。特别重要的就是这些人并不简单是苏美战争的被动的受惠人，他们把以内战的威胁而引起的苏美战争，简直当作他们自己的利益。
    在反内战者当中，有如立法院长孙科，国共谈判的重要人物邵力子等人，这些人知道假如内战蔓延下去，中国之经济问题便会非常严重，也有军人包括冯玉祥及其他等人。虽然在这些人中间比诸胶织在一起的右翼集团中间有着更多的分歧之点，但也可举出他们意见的全貌。虽然自由主义分子为数不少，比诸在美国一般想像者为多，但他们有一个共同点，即缺乏决定的力量。文人不管位置有多高，在反动的大海中，还只是些个人，而进步的军人在过去早已被政府剥夺了军权。
    他们以经济的理由反对内战，认为军事冲突扩展下去，会造成极度的紊乱。一个经济官吏对我说：“我知道工商人士觉得怎样………真正和平一旦实现，我们的困难大半便可解决。”宋子文的地位有些模糊不清。无疑问的他害怕内战，但同时，他推行为内战所必须之经济对策——如征收粮食以代地亩税，并且为军阀所统治的政府从美国获取更大的援助。
    对打败共产党的可能性上，国民党自由主义分子和军阀有尖锐的不同。他们相信，即使共军从某些铁路区域及战略据点被排斥出去，但仍可在任何一地前进。而且自由主义分子更相信任何个别成功的价值，都远抵不过因大规模战争而削弱政府的结果。他们想，五六个月之后共产党的问题在中国还是依然如故。他们有一个人对我说：“中国喜欢和平民主，但不需要共产主义。假如战争继续下去，共产党是不会被消灭的。假如战争和紊乱继续下去，共产党还会更多。”
    对于苏美关系将来的看法。自由主义分子和军阀也不相同，他们认为右翼分子估计错误。大多数人都认为美国会继续在内战中援助中央政府，有些人认为会停止，或表示怀疑。但是都相信即使有苏美战争的话，也要比军阀们所预料者远得很多。一个官员在接见我时，他说：“斯大林是个痛快人，假如因美国认为苏联进得太多，似乎是要发生战争，也就会让些步。也许在十五年或二十年内会发生战争，但他不会很快的。”
    另一自由主义分子很肯定的对我讲：“军阀们认为继续内战就可激起苏美冲突。他们认为这样就可加强他们在中国独裁专制的力量，这是他们的一个希奇的幻想，我认为不会有苏美战争。苏联与美国之间有矛盾那是事实，不过美苏两国人民皆不愿战争。”一般的国民党自由主义分子都赞成苏联与美国有亲密关系。他们不要把中国作为两强的战场，但希望与双方皆极友好，进行和平建设。
    在这种情况下，关键的问题之一即决定蒋介石的态度。一个人实在很少听到他的意见，这一方面是因为政府的首脑常常比他的属下要离得人们远些，一方面也因为在中国这个政府也没有把政纲向人民详细的说个清楚的必要。但有一个事实，不要弄错，就是蒋介石是政府的统治人物，在一切人之上。例如人们常讨论或预测马歇尔或中共代表周恩来的态度，但根本没有人问一问政府代表徐永昌想法如何？这是值得注意的。道理很简单：每个人都晓得只有蒋介石的想法才算数。
    蒋介石的思想，可是也能从他属下的行动中，从他在六月中旬亲身提交马歇尔转达中共的非常强硬的条件中推论出来。一般认为今后将以现款缴税，而蒋介石却亲身决定以实物征收地亩税，这也是人人皆知的事。以实物收税为的是可以从农民获得粮食供养军队。从各种事实来看，蒋介石的观点早已就是右翼的观点，他自己和南京政府和国民党内好战分子们也是一而二，二而一，下这样的结论，大概是合乎道理的。
    虽然美国声明的政策是有条件的，即在中国获得和平民主统一的程度上援助中国，但时局发展的钥匙是操在美国政府之手，因为美国的物资援助加强了主张内战的一派。国民党的两翼、共产党、第三党之自由主义分子及无党无派人士的相互行动，大都是在美国政策的框子之中。这样就使美国担负一种特殊的责任，使美国的政策能有效的促进内部和平，而不是扩大中国内战，就成为更加重要了。    （原文载美国新共和杂志）
