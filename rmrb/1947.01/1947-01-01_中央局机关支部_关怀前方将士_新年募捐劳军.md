    Caring for Frontline Soldiers
    New Year's Donation Drive for the Troops
    [Our Newspaper] To welcome the victorious New Year of 1947, the Central Bureau Agency Branch, in order to inspire all comrades to care more for the front lines, strengthen work support for the front lines, and strive for new victories, launched a donation campaign under the slogans "Don't forget the front lines during the New Year" and "Welcome 1947 with practical actions." Thanks to the infinite care of all comrades for the front lines, within three days, it raised 15,025 Jibi currency, 12 towels, 6 pairs of socks, and items such as soap, shoes, and pencils, and prepared a New Year's greeting letter to send to the front lines. During the movement, many comrades took out what they could, and the young comrades of the Special Duty Class also volunteered to take out their only money and belongings. The branch now proposes not only to comfort the front lines materially, but also to further improve work efficiency and support the front lines with practical actions.

　　中央局机关支部
    关怀前方将士
    新年募捐劳军
    【本报讯】中央局机关支部在迎接胜利的一九四七年新年之际，为了启发全体同志对前线的关怀更有力的加强工作支援前线，争取新的胜利起见，在“过年不忘前方”，“用实际行动迎接一九四七年”的口号下掀起募捐运动。由于全体同志对前方的无限关怀，三天之内即募集了冀钞一万五千零二十五元，毛巾十二条，袜子六双和肥皂鞋子铅笔等件，并备有贺年信一封送交前方。运动中很多同志都拿出了自己所能拿出的东西，特别公务班的小同志也志愿的拿出自己仅有的钱物。现支部提出不仅在物质上慰劳前方，而更要进一步提高工作效率，用实际行动支援前线。
