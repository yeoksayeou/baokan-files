　　Since the peasants of Tianshui Ridge, Jincheng, were thoroughly emancipated, their enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. During the rule of the Tongtai Association, Tianshui Ridge only had one Hongdong woman who lived in the village who could spin and weave, and all the thread used by the women of the village was bought from outside. Now that the masses have obtained land and been freed from feudal oppression, they are extremely enthusiastic about production. All the young and strong men go back and forth transporting [goods], and the women and elderly are organized to spin and weave. There are already 217 spinning wheels and 13 looms in the village, turning day and night. The six looms in Tianshui Ridge village alone can produce four bolts of cloth per day. Si Gengxiang, who is weak and unable to transport goods, also participates in the women's spinning and weaving group, spinning half a catty of cotton per day. After a fierce class struggle, the level of awareness of the masses in Tianshui Ridge has also been unprecedentedly raised, and they are actively helping the masses in other villages to emancipate themselves and engage in production. The women of the village have learned to spin and weave themselves, and lead women from neighboring villages such as Lichuan and Tianjingguan to organize spinning and weaving, teaching dozens of apprentices. The cooperative cooperates with the spinning and weaving movement to solve difficulties for the spinners. As a result, the cooperative distributes dividends each time, and the share capital also expands accordingly. In two months, the cooperative's share capital increased from 90,000 to 430,000. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, the women of the village can spin and weave enough cloth for the whole village to wear for a year before the spring plowing.

　　天水岭翻身妇女生产劲头大
    纺车织机日夜不停
    【本报太岳九日电】晋城天水岭农民彻底翻身后，生产情绪空前提高。天水岭在同泰会统治时代，仅有一个在该村下户的洪洞妇女会纺织，全村妇女所用的线都是向外购买。现在群众得到了土地，解脱了封建压迫，生产异常起劲，全村青壮往返运输，妇女及老年皆组织起来纺织，全村已有二百一十七架纺车，十三架织机，日夜不息的转动着，仅天水岭本村六架机子，每日可出四匹布，身体衰弱的司更祥，不能运输亦参加妇女纺织组，一日纺花半斤。天水岭群众经过一场剧烈的阶级斗争后，觉悟程度亦空前提高，积极的帮助外村群众翻身生产，该村妇女自己学会了纺织并代领邻村，犁川、天井关等妇女组织纺织，教会徒弟数十个。合作社配合纺织运动，为纺妇解决困难，因此合作社每分一次红，股金亦随着扩大，两个月中，合作社股金由九万增至四十三万。据该合作社负责人谈，在春耕前全村妇女纺织可供全村一年穿衣。
