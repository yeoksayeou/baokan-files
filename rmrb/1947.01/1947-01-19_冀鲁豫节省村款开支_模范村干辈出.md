　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province Saves Village Expenses
    Model Village Cadres Emerge
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 17th] Since the Regional Party Committee called for saving village expenses and reducing the burden on the masses, many model village cadres who saved village burdens have been discovered. Xie Jinhe and Xie Yihui, village cadres of Xie'erzhuang in Bo County's First District, confiscated the firewood of the traitors during the clearing of village burdens. Although the masses decided that the village cadres should use it, they refused and sold it to be used as village education funds. They said, "Last year, when the traitors were here, the common people suffered too much and haven't recovered yet. If we burn a little less firewood, the common people can contribute a little less." In the year since liberation, the burden on their entire village, excluding public grain, was only two jin and twelve liang of wheat per mu of land, and very little firewood (the above expenses include education fees, meeting expenses, militia expenses, and village office expenses, etc.). Village cadres Li Zhongshun and Xie Jizhao of Xie Jinkongzhuang, and elementary school teacher Li Jinghan, etc., eat at their own homes and save their personal benefits to buy a set of gongs and drums for the village. Village cadres Qi Yueluo and Xiao Zhenjiang of Qizhuang, etc., save their benefit grain to buy a batch of bowls and chopsticks for public use in the village. They said, "Sooner or later, there will be weddings and funerals in the village, and it will be too much trouble to collect chopsticks and bowls every time. It's much more convenient for the masses to have these things in public."

　　冀鲁豫节省村款开支
    模范村干辈出
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】自区党委号召节省村款开支，减轻群众负担后，发现许多节省村负担的模范村干。博平一区谢二庄之村干谢金河、谢以会等，在清理村负担的时候，没收汉奸的柴草，已经群众决议叫村干用，但他们却不要，变卖后，充当村教育费。他们说：“去年汉奸在时，老百姓太苦了，还没翻过劲来，我们少烧这点柴火，老百姓就可以少拿点”。解放以来的一年，他们全村负担除公粮以外每亩负担地仅摊二斤十二两麦子，柴更不多（以上化费包括教育费、开会用的、民兵费用、村办公费等）。谢晋贡庄村干李忠顺、谢吉召，高小教员李景汉等，他们在自己家里吃饭，把个人待遇省出来，村里买了一套锣鼓。齐庄村干齐曰落、萧振江等，他们把待遇粮食节约出来，买了一批碗筷，作村中公用。他们说：“村里早晚有个红白喜事，就要现凑筷碗，太费事了。公所有这些东西，群众多方便。”
