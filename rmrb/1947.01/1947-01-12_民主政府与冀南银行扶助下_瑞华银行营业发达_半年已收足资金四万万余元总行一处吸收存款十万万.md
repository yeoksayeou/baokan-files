With the Support of the Democratic Government and the Ji'nan Bank
Ruihua Bank's Business Flourishes
　　Capital of Over 400 Million Yuan Collected in Half a Year; Head Office Alone Absorbs 1 Billion Yuan in Deposits

[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Hu Zhuxuan, a national capitalist and General Manager of Ruihua Bank, a private bank in the Border Region, wrote an article on New Year's Day entitled "Ruihua Bank in the Past Six Months," stating: "Ruihua was established in June last year with the approval of the Border Region government, which also took care of its business development. No restrictions were imposed on its business operations, and it was specially permitted to conduct gold, silver, and securities trading and warehousing operations; no restrictions were imposed on interest rate policies, which were entirely determined by us. Ruihua has received the support of the government and the Ji'nan Bank, the sponsorship of all sectors of the Border Region, and the enthusiastic subscription and investment of shares by industrial and commercial entrepreneurs and the broad masses of the people. The originally approved capital of 200 million yuan was subsequently increased to 500 million yuan by the shareholders, with the requirement to collect it by the end of the year. At present, the head office and branches in various locations have actually collected 411 million yuan, equivalent to approximately 2.05 billion yuan in legal tender. The business is full of vigorous atmosphere. Not long after opening, it was greatly affected by the Kuomintang's large-scale offensive against the Border Region. Fortunately, the democratic government adopted a policy of vigorous support for private banks, so it was still able to earn profits twice its capital in the past six months. Due to the impact of the war, the final accounts for the 36th year will be conducted at the end of January this year."

A summary of the head office's work in the past six months: First, it absorbed a large amount of deposits and invested them in various production and construction projects in the Border Region, helping to prosper the market and support industry. In addition to general industrial and commercial loans and loans to poor urban vendors, it supported industrial and mining and transportation cooperative enterprises. As of the end of November last year, the head office had absorbed 99.817 million yuan in various deposits and provided 24.291 million yuan in various loans. It loaned 13 million yuan to the Fengfeng Coal Mine and, in addition to investing 3 million yuan in the Cizhou Porcelain Sales Station, it also loaned 5 million yuan and provided the Cizhou Porcelain Credit Cooperative with a long-term loan of 1.5 million yuan for regulation. Second, it regulated materials in the Border Region's interior, such as the regulation of essential goods for the people, such as salt, homespun cloth, cotton, and grain, solving the problem of sales and export of agricultural products produced by farmers, such as the organization of peach kernel exports from the Taihang Region.

Third, it supported various private banks. Taking the six private banks in Handan, where the head office is located, as an example, each was regularly given an average of more than 4 million yuan in interbank overdrafts, charging a low monthly interest rate of only 2%, with no restrictions on their own deposit and lending rates. Private banks here played the role of assistants to the bank. There is no bad phenomenon of national banks annexing private banks in the Jiang-controlled areas; instead, a genuine public-private joint operation has been established, working together to enrich the people.

　　民主政府与冀南银行扶助下
    瑞华银行营业发达
  　半年已收足资金四万万余元总行一处吸收存款十万万
    【本报讯】民族资本家，边区民营瑞华银行总经理胡竹轩先生，于元旦日撰文，题为《半年来的瑞华银行》内称：“去年六月瑞华成立，边区政府批准立案，并照顾其业务的发展。在经营业务上不加任何限制，特许其作金银证券买卖与仓库经营；在利息政策上，也不加任何限制，完全由我们自由订定。瑞华受到政府与冀南银行的扶助、边区各界的赞助，并工商企业家与广大人民的踊跃认股、入股，原本额定资本二万万元，各股东继又决定增为五万万元，规定至年底收齐，目前总行与各地分行已实收资本四万万一千万元，约合法币二十万万五千万元。营业充满了蓬勃的气象，在开业未久，即遇到国民党向边区大举进攻，使瑞华受到很大影响，幸民主政府对私营银行采取大力扶助的政策，故半年来仍能赚到倍于资金的利润。由于战争影响，三十六年度决算改在今年一月底进行”。
    半年来总行工作概况：首先是吸收了大量存款，投入边区各种生产建设事业，帮助繁荣了市场，扶助了工业。除过一般的工商业放款，城市贫苦摊贩款，支持了工矿、运输合作事业。截至去年十一月底，总行吸收各项存款九万九千八百一十七万元，举办各种贷款二万四千二百九十一万元。对峰峰煤矿即贷出一千三百万元。对磁业运销总站，除投资三百万元外，又贷款五百万元，还给磁业信用合作社以一百五十万元的长期贷款，以资调剂。其次是调剂边区内地物资。如人民主要必需品之食盐、土布、棉花、粮食之调剂，解决了农民生产土产的销路出口问题。如对太行区桃仁的组织出口。
    第三是各个私营银号的扶助，仅以总行所在地邯郸六家私人银号而言，平均每家经常给予四百余万元的同业透支，仅收月息二厘之低额利息，对他们本身的存放利息，也不予限制。私人银号在这里起了银行的助手作用。在边区没有像蒋管区国家银行并吞私人银行的恶劣现象；而是真正建立了公私同营，协力为人民致富而努力的方针。
