[This article was] transmitted by this newspaper from Weixian, 18th: In the "Annihilate Chiang's Troops Invading Jinnan in Jinnan" campaign, Kou Mingzhen, a militia member from Pingyuan County, and the militia from Village ×× and Camp ×× in Yongnian County, achieved significant results in explosive warfare. The Jinnan Military Affairs Committee issued a special commendation and conferred the glorious title of Explosive Hero on Comrade Kou Mingzhen. The circular stated in brief: Since the launch of the explosive warfare movement, Kou Mingzhen has not only actively learned and planted landmines himself but also patiently persuaded the militia cadres in neighboring villages to teach everyone how to use landmines, enabling the widespread development of the explosive warfare movement in the area. He also called on all militia members in the region to set up landmine arrays everywhere and extend the explosive warfare movement to the vicinity of enemy strongholds, turning all enemies entering Jinnan into ghosts under the mines.
[This article was] transmitted by this newspaper from Weixian, 18th: Kou Mingzhen, the explosive hero of the Pingyuan County militia, is a highly conscious poor peasant. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he led the masses in guerrilla warfare and repeatedly achieved extraordinary merit. Last year, during the autumn wheat planting season, his village borrowed many livestock from other villages to plow the land. Kou Mingzhen automatically led two militia members, carrying four homemade cannons, to guard the road where the enemy might come. When they discovered the enemy, they calmly waited until the enemy approached before firing a volley of cannons, causing the enemy to flee in disarray. Kou Mingzhen and the others successfully defended the autumn plowing and also captured three hundred bullets. When it came time to harvest the grain, the enemy came again to plunder. He immediately put down his work in the fields and went to block the enemy. When the enemy approached the village, he tied seven hand grenades together with his belt and threw them out, then fired two shots in succession. The enemy, seeing the situation was not good, turned around and ran away. Later, Kou Mingzhen was transferred by his superiors to receive explosive training. He patiently studied various issues in explosives, insisting on attending classes even when he was ill. After graduating, he said, "The superiors have taught us these skills, and we must serve the masses well." As soon as he returned to the village, he transformed five hand grenades into landmines, using the explosions in his own village to influence other villages. On one occasion, when the enemy set out to loot grain, one of them was killed by Kou Mingzhen's landmine, and they fled in disarray. Kou Mingzhen immediately led the militia of his own village to support Dong Village, and as a result, they also drove away the enemy. Kou Mingzhen also planned for the long term, teaching the militia of four neighboring villages how to plant landmines within five days. He often said to people, "Explosions are very effective. Landmines can work for the living, with small investment and large returns. Planting one, two, eight hundred landmines can exchange for seventy or eighty enemies." Under his patient persuasion, many people became involved in the explosive warfare movement. Once, he went to another village to teach how to plant landmines, and the village cadre laughed at him and said, "You're bragging after only two days of training. We don't need you to take care of our village's affairs." He was rebuffed and couldn't sleep at night. He thought, "If I don't teach the neighboring villages, the explosive warfare movement cannot be universally developed. But if I teach, the village cadres won't listen." Finally, he came up with a solution: to teach that village through the district, so that the explosive warfare movement could be developed without causing any disagreements. As a result, he was invited to that village to be an instructor. At the beginning, he knew that everyone did not understand explosives and was afraid of being blown up, so he first told others to lie down far away while he disassembled the hand grenade to install the landmine alone. Everyone watched and saw that nothing happened, so they slowly gathered around to learn. He taught everyone step by step and said, "Let's discuss everything and do it together. Although I teach like this, I also listen to your good ideas. Whoever has the right idea, we'll follow that." Therefore, the masses were willing to learn from him and even created some new methods. The mass explosive warfare movement was then launched in the area. When Kou Mingzhen was awarded the title of Explosive Hero this time, he was not proud at all and still painstakingly said to everyone he met, "If Jinnan universally launches landmine warfare, the enemy will not dare to advance or retreat, so we can finally clean them up all at once."

　　平原县积极开展爆炸运动
    民兵寇明珍屡建奇功
    冀南武委总会特通令表扬
    予寇同志以爆炸英雄称号
    【本报威县十八日电】在“把侵入冀南蒋军消灭在冀南”作战中，平原县民兵寇明珍及永年县××村和××营民兵，在爆炸战中获得显著成绩，冀南武委总会特通令表扬，并赐予寇明珍同志以爆炸英雄的光荣称号。通报略谓：自开展爆炸运动后，寇明珍除自己积极学习与埋设地雷外，并耐心说服邻近一片村的民兵干部，教会大家使用地雷，使该地区爆炸运动得以普遍开展。并号召全区民兵到处摆地雷阵，把爆炸运动开展到敌人据点附近去，叫进入冀南的敌人都变成雷下鬼。
    【本报威县十八日电】平原县民兵爆炸英雄寇明珍，是个觉悟很高的贫农。在抗日战争中，即领导群众打游击，屡建奇功。去年秋耕种麦时，他村从外村借了许多牲口来犁地，寇明珍自动率领两个民兵，带着四门土炮，在敌人可能来的路上担任警戒，当发现敌人时，他们很沉着地等到敌人走近了，才一排土炮打过去，敌人狼狈回窜。寇明珍等这次胜利的保卫了秋耕，还缴获了三百发子弹。到割谷子时，敌人又来抢掠，他马上放下地里活，去阻击敌人，当敌人近村时，他把七颗手榴弹用裤腰带拴在一块投出去，又连打了两枪，敌人见势不妙，回头便跑。后来，上级调寇明珍受爆炸训练，他很耐心的研究爆炸中的各种问题，病中仍要坚持听课，毕业后他说：“上级教给咱这些本事，咱必须好好为群众服务才行。”一回村，即把五个手榴弹改造成地雷，以自己村爆炸去影响别村。某次敌人出发抢粮，被寇明珍的地雷炸死一名，狼狈逃窜，寇明珍又马上带领本村民兵去支援东村，结果把敌人也打跑了。寇明珍并为长期打算，五天内教会邻近四个村的民兵装地雷。他见人常常说：“爆炸可顶事，地雷能替活人办事，本小利大，千二八百装个地雷，能换敌人七八十来个。”在他耐心说服下，许多人卷入了爆炸运动。一次，他又到外村去教埋地雷，村干部笑他说：“受了两天训就吹牛，俺村的事不用你管”。他碰了钉子，回去老是睡不着觉，他想：“不教会旁村，爆炸运动不能普遍开展，教吧，村干又不认头。”终于，他想出了一个办法：通过区里去教那个村，这样既可开展爆炸运动，又不会闹意见。结果他被请到那个村里去当教员。开始时，他知道大家对爆炸不了解，恐怕炸着了，便先叫别人离远点卧倒，他独自拆卸手榴弹装置地雷，大家看着没事，便慢慢集拢跟前学习，他一样一样的教给大家，并且说：“咱们一切事讨论着办，我虽是这样教也听你们的高主意，谁想的对就依着谁作。”所以群众都乐意跟他学，还创造了好些新办法。群众性的爆炸运动便在该地开展起来了。这次寇明珍荣膺爆炸英雄的称号时，他一点也不骄傲，仍然苦口婆心地到处逢人就说：“如果冀南普遍开展地雷战，叫敌人进不敢进，退不敢退，好最后一下子把它收拾干净。”
