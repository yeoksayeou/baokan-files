The moment the masses' emancipation movement unfolds, the issue of "fruits" (i.e. the spoils of struggle) arises. If we are not careful, these fruits can easily be embezzled and wasted by a few, which will greatly dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. For example, in the early stages of the movement, 500,000 to 600,000 yuan worth of fruits in Jiang Village were spent by the joint defense team; in Tapo, each extremely poor person received only 2,000 yuan, while an activist received a bonus of 20,000 yuan, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. With a large pile of fruits right in front of them, problems easily arise over time. In some villages, it was discovered that fruits were stolen; in others, activists were found to be embezzling jointly. Reactionaries, in order to undermine the masses' emancipation movement, spread rumors everywhere, saying, "After the struggle, the Eighth Route Army will take the fruits away," or "The Eighth Route Army wants a 20/80 split: if you struggle for 10,000 yuan, the Eighth Route Army takes 8,000." To break these rumors, quick distribution is essential. In the early stages of the struggle, many people hesitated. Once the fruits were distributed, they immediately became resolute. Many things the masses had never seen before; once they were actually in their hands, their struggle enthusiasm immediately increased. After the distribution of fruits, a large number of masses poured into the farmers' associations in most villages. Because this struggle is a general liquidation movement by the entire peasantry against feudal forces, it is very complex in terms of fruits. In addition to land, there are also farm tools, oxen, houses, and other properties, totaling hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan in each village. In addition to distributing according to class relations such as landless peasants, poor peasants, and middle peasants, it is also necessary to consider who lacks farm tools, who lacks oxen, etc., so that farmers can manage production after receiving the fruits. The broad masses of toiling peasants, under the long-term policy of deceiving the people by feudal forces, are honest peasants who are illiterate, afraid of getting involved, and have never had the experience of distributing fruits. This further increases the difficulty of distributing fruits. Land reform in the countryside only happens once. The quality of fruit distribution not only affects the mood of the masses at the time but will also be a decisive factor in the future economic life of the broad masses. Therefore, every cadre needs to be very responsible in leading the masses to handle the fruit problem after the movement. In the early stages, we did not fully recognize the complexity and importance of this work. In practice, guiding the masses' great struggle took half a month to a month at most, while handling the fruits took more than two months and was still not completely clear.

  Different Methods of Distributing Fruits and Their Results

    Based on this period of experience, it is good to distribute fruits as the struggle progresses in the early stages of the movement. This can prevent embezzlement and waste by a few, stimulate the masses' struggle enthusiasm, and raise class consciousness. However, if this continues completely, it will prolong the time of the movement. After several distributions, the masses gain experience. The remaining items can be kept by a storage committee of six or seven members elected by the masses. They can be stored until after the struggle is over, and then distributed all at once, saving a lot of time. Land is not afraid of being stolen. Dividing it too finely is not good for cultivation. The method of distributing fruits as the struggle progresses should not be adopted. The method of supplementing from bottom to top should be adopted. There are no major differences or problems in various places. The key is that the original red contracts must be obtained from the landlords and then go through a large number of procedures such as establishing contracts and paying taxes to make them the private property of the farmers. Only then can it be considered a victory.

    How women are divided varies from place to place. Some places use farmers as the standard and only offer small rewards to female members. This is because women and men are not treated equally. Doing so cannot break the old society's erroneous view of underestimating women, and cannot enable women to play their due role in the mass emancipation movement. Some areas treat women and men the same. They lead together during the struggle, and they share the same way when distributing fruits. It is stipulated that the things that women should share should be handed over to them personally, and they should handle them themselves, without letting others collect them on their behalf. Unmarried daughters share land, things, and fruits like others. The land they receive is taken away by themselves when they get married. In places where this method is adopted, the role of women in the movement is no less than that of men, which greatly enhances the power of the masses in the movement.

    The experience of Wenxin Village is that regardless of whether they are members or not, as long as they are basic masses, they share the fruits equally. This promoted the progress of some basic masses, broke the closed-doorism of some masses, and greatly increased the number of people participating in the movement. The experience of Ertun: those who are members share, those who are not members do not share. As a result, some people who wanted to share fruits joined the association. Although this also expanded the number of members, it easily generated the closed-door thinking of members and could not absorb more people to participate. Some places emphasize distribution according to class, that is, dividing the basic masses into three grades and nine levels, four grades and twelve levels, or five grades and fifteen levels according to landless peasants, poor peasants, middle peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants, and then dividing them according to each member of the family. The difference between each mu (Chinese unit of measurement for land) is one-and-a-half times, half a times, or one-quarter of a times. This method of distribution is basically correct. Some places take good care of the elderly, weak, widowed, orphaned, and military dependents. They have determined that martyrs' families should be allocated two to three mu more land than the general masses, and the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned should be allocated one to two mu more land. Unmarried bachelors over the age of thirty-five are also allocated more land, like the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned, in order to help them get married.

    公平合理分果实的重大作用
    夏津群运经验之二
    当群众的翻身运动一展开，果实问题随即产生了，如果我们不注意，这些果实很容易为少数人贪污浪费，这样就会大大打击群众的情绪。如运动初期，蒋寨五六十万元的果实，都被联防队花了；塔坡每个赤贫最多只分二千元，一个积极分子就提奖两万元，群众非常不满。一大堆果实摆在眼前，时间一长，很容易出毛病，如有的村庄发现果实被人偷去，有的村庄发现积极分子共同贪污，反动分子为了破坏群众的翻身运动，到处造谣说：“斗争后八路军要将果实带走”，有的说：“八路军要二八分红，斗一万元，八路军要八千。”为了击破这些谣言，所以快分是非常必要的。在斗争初期，有好多人表现犹豫；果实分到手之后，立刻坚决起来，好多东西群众从来没有看到过，实在分到自己手里了，斗争情绪立刻提高起来，大部分村庄经过分果实，大量的群众涌进农会。由于这次斗争，是发动全体农民，向封建势力进行总清算运动，表现在果实方面也非常复杂，除土地外，还有农具、耕牛、房屋及其他资财，每个村庄都是上百上千万元的东西。除按着赤贫、贫农、中农等阶级关系分配外，又需要照顾谁缺农具，谁缺耕牛等，以便使农民分得果实后，随着就能经营生产。广大的劳苦农民，在封建势力长期的愚民政策统治下，老实农民不识字，不敢多事，从来又都没有分果实的经验，这就更增加了分果实的困难。农村的土地改革只有这一次，果实分的好坏，不仅影响当时的群众情绪，他将是广大群众今后经济生活上的决定因素，因此就需要每一个干部在运动之后十分负责的领导群众处理果实问题。我们在初期对这一工作的复杂性及重要性，均认识不足，实际证明，指导群众的大动，最长是用了半月到一个月的时间，处理果实用了两个多月的时间，还没有完全处理清楚。
  分果实的几个不同方法及其结果
    根据这一段经验来看，在运动初期，随斗随分是好的，可以防止少数人的贪污浪费，可以刺激群众的斗争情绪与提高阶级觉悟；但如完全这样作下去，会使运动的时间拖长。分几次之后，群众有了经验，下余的东西，可由群众选举六七个保管委员，组织一个保管委员会，保管起来，等斗完之后，一总来分，可以节省好多时间。土地不怕有人偷了去，分割的太零碎不好耕种，不应采用随斗随分的办法，应采用自下而上补齐，各地都没大的出入，也没出什么大毛病，问题的关键在于必须由地主手里将原有红契文书要出来，再经过大量立契税契等手续，使之变为农民个人的私产，这样才算得到胜利。
    妇女如何分法，各地都不一致；有的地方是以农民为标准，对妇会员只是提出小部分奖励，这是没有将妇女和男人平等看待的缘故，这样做不能打破旧社会轻视妇女的错误观点，不能使妇女在群众的解放运动中起她应有的作用。有一些地区是将妇女和男人一样看待，在斗争时共同领导，在分果实时一样来分，并规定妇女应分的东西交她本人，由他本人去处理，不让别人代收。未出嫁的闺女，和别人一样分地，分东西，分得土地在出嫁时由本人带走。采用这个办法的地方，妇女在运动中的作用比男的一点都不低，大大增强了群众在运动中的威力。
    温辛庄的经验是不论在会与否，只要是基本群众就一样分果实；这样促成了一部分基本群众的进步，打破了某些群众的关门主义，使参加运动的人数大大增加了。二屯的经验：在会分，不在会不分，结果一部分想分果实的人就在了会。这样虽也扩大了会员，但易于产生会员的关门思想，不能吸收更广泛的人参加。有的地方是强调按阶级分，即将基本群众按赤贫、贫农、中农、富裕中农，又按全家每人分一份，划为三等九级，四等十二级或五等十五级，每亩中间以一倍半倍或四分之一倍的差额来分，这样分法基本上是对的。有的地方对老弱孤寡军工属都照顾的很好，他们确定烈军属要比一般群众多分二亩到三亩地，老弱孤寡多分一亩到二亩地，三十五岁以上未结婚的光棍汉，为了帮他结婚，也和老弱孤寡一样多分一些地。
