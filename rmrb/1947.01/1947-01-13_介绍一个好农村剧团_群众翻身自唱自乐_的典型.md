Introducing a Good Rural Theater Troupe
　　A Typical Example of "The Masses Overturning Themselves, Singing and Amusing Themselves"
　　Shu Yu

　　In the "Everyone Talks" column of this newspaper on January 7th, the issue of "performing old plays, avoid wasting" was raised, proposing "developing rural theater troupes, advocating self-writing, self-singing, and self-entertainment." Comrade Shu Yu's article can be said to provide relatively complete answers to the direction, leadership, performance content and form, and funding of rural theater troupes. It is published for reference in various regions.

　　Last November, I was working in Fucheng Village, Jincheng County, and saw the famous Taiyue Fucheng Rural Theater Troupe. On the day Fucheng Village held a celebration of the liberation, I heard that "locally made" (the nickname given to the theater troupe by the masses) would be performed, and the meeting was exceptionally lively. Apart from the front and back curtains made from old cooperative shed cloth, there was no special arrangement on the stage. The chairman of the farmers' association told me enthusiastically about the origin of this troupe:
　　"Our old farmers in Fucheng Village have always been oppressed by the landlords, who would have the mood to perform plays! Since the land reform movement in the winter school last year, everyone formed a club and jointly wrote a play called 'The Palace of Hell,' turning the village's biggest landlord Xu Guanwei, second landlord Niu Jingtang, third landlord Xu Hansan, fourth landlord Xu Xiuqing, fifth landlord Niu Ergong, judge Feng Shude, and minions Xu Congshi, who controlled the village's political power and exploited the peasants, into a Yangko dance. At first, it was just a casual duet, but later it was staged on a small platform. People who saw it all cried and shouted to take revenge on the traitors and bullies. The actors also said: 'We suffered in the past, we fight now, and we write and sing ourselves. We ordinary folks have been liberated!' From then on, our Fucheng Village had a rural theater troupe.
　　"During the rent reduction and debt clearing campaign, the tragic story of Chen Furun in the village, who was forced to ruin his family, sell his children, and abandon his daughters by the treacherous landlord, was adapted into a three-act play called 'The Poor are Suffering' in two days and three nights. It was performed at a mass rally in the city. The actress Wang Shiying cried so much at the heartbreaking part that she couldn't continue the performance on stage. The audience cried as one and unanimously demanded to see the end of the treacherous landlords, but the troupe hadn't written that part yet. Everyone left the troupe in the city, and various organizations mobilized 170 liters of millet and 25 kilograms of white flour for the troupe to eat. After five or six days of intensive work, three more acts were written. In the second performance, when the fight scene was performed, the audience shouted in unison, 'Fight!' The masses said, 'Such things happen in every village, and even if we write thirty or fifty acts, we can't finish them!' At that time, the second, sixth, and seventh districts invited the troupe to perform in their areas for more than twenty days, promoting the work there. Originally, people in that area looked down on small theater troupes, but after the Fucheng troupe performed 'The Poor are Suffering,' it overshadowed the old operas! During the county's cultural and entertainment competition, a banner of 'The Masses Overturning Themselves, Singing and Amusing Themselves' was specially awarded to our troupe."
　　When the sun set, the meeting ended. The people at the meeting were divided into two parts: one part were the actors, each carrying their makeup and going on stage, and the majority were the audience, all squeezed under the stage. After the opening gongs and drums, the curtain quickly opened. This play was called "The Sequel to the Poor are Suffering," from Qin Sanshi's escape from the village, suffering hardships, to returning after the mass movement was launched and fighting for liberation. The audience, like in a group meeting, were brewing their feelings as the plot developed, sympathizing with the poor brothers and cursing the evil landlords, almost making people forget that they were watching a play. I truly admired their successful performance.
　　The actors of the Fucheng Theater Troupe are all members of the Farmers' Association, and some participate as a family. The leaders of the troupe are also the village cadres, such as the village head who is also the head of the troupe and an actor. They write and perform about the affairs of their village, educating the villagers and promoting the mass movement. This is the first characteristic of the Fucheng Theater Troupe, and also the direction of its development. In addition, according to what I know, there are two other characteristics:
　　First, it constantly writes and performs new plays as the mass movement develops, such as performing "The Palace of Hell" during the anti-bully campaign; performing "The Poor are Suffering" and "The Sequel to the Poor are Suffering" during the rent reduction and debt clearing campaign; performing "Production" during the spring plowing season; performing "Little Coal Hammer Joins the Army" during the conscription campaign; performing "Liberated Hero Xu Anan" during the liberation hero conference... All of them are performing about the affairs of the village, promoting the central work. After the retreat from Jiaozuo Qinghua, Jincheng County actively prepared for war. Militiamen, women, and children were all busy making gunpowder and stone mines. A militia group cut gray straw in the morning and performed "The Gunpowder Depot" in the evening. They wrote as they cut, performing their own affairs and performing the affairs of the day, which made the war preparation work progress smoothly.
　　Second, it does not delay production and does not increase the burden on the masses. During the busy farming season, they write scripts individually during the day and rehearse collectively at night. All makeup and scenery are very simple, and it does not cost much to rehearse and perform. As for how to solve some small expenses, they decided to engage in some collective production next year to run the troupe well.

　　介绍一个好农村剧团
    “群众翻身自唱自乐”的典型
    束玉
    本月七日本刊“大家谈”栏所载“唱旧戏、莫浪费”中提出“发展农村剧团，提倡自编、自唱、自乐”的问题，束玉同志的这篇文章，可以说是对于农村剧团的方向、领导、演出内容与形式，以及经费等方面，都作了较圆满的解答。特为发表，以供各地参考。
　　　　　    编者
　　　　　  
    去年十一月，我在晋城县府城村工作，看到了太岳有名的府城农村剧团。府城村开庆祝翻身大会的那天听说要演“本地造”（群众给戏团起的绰号），会开的格外起劲。舞台上除了用旧社的棚布改作成的前幕和后幕外，没有什么特殊的布置。农会主席兴致勃勃的给我谈着这个剧团的来历：
    “咱府城村的老农民，一向受阎王爷们的压迫，谁有心情演戏！自从去年冬学里闹翻身，大家成立了一个俱乐部，碰伙编了一个剧叫《森罗殿》，把村中大阎王续观伟，二阎王牛敬堂，三阎王续汉三，四阎王续秀清，五阎王牛二棍，判官冯树德，小鬼续从时等掌握村政权，统治剥削农民的罪恶编成秧歌，起初只是随便的对唱一番，后来就拉起场来，在一个小台子上试演了一遍，看的人都哭了，高喊要向汉奸恶霸报仇。演员们也说：“过去吃苦是咱们，如今斗争是咱们，编的唱的也是咱们，咱们‘土圪瘩’翻身了！”从这起，咱府城村才有了农村剧团。
    “闹减租清债的时候，又把村里陈富润受奸霸地主逼得家破人亡、卖儿弃女的悲惨故事，用两天三夜的工夫，编成了三幕《穷人难》，在城内群众大会上出演，女演员王士英演到痛心之处，爬到台上哭得演不下去。台下的人哭成一片，一致要求看看奸恶地主的下场，可是剧团还没有编到那里。大家就留剧团住在城里，各机关动员了一石七斗小米，五十斤白面给剧团吃。突击了五六天，又编成三幕，第二次出演，演到斗争一场时，台上台下，同声喊打。群众说：“这样的事情，那村也有，就是编三十幕五十幕也演不完！”当时有二区六区和七区，请剧团到他们那里演了二十多天，推动了那里的工作。本来那一带的人，从来看不起小剧团，可是经过咱府城剧团演了《穷人难》以后，把旧日的大戏都压倒了！全县文化娱乐大竞赛时，专门奖给咱剧团一面‘群众翻身，自唱自乐’的奖旗。”
    夕阳傍山的时候，大会开完了。会场的人分成了两部分，一部分是演员，各人带着化装的东西走上舞台去，一大部分是观众，都挤在台下，开台锣鼓响罢，很快的就开幕了。这一幕剧叫《续穷人难》，从本村秦三士逃难在外，受苦受难一直演到群运发动后，逃难回来，斗争翻身。观众们像开小组会一样随着剧情的发展，大家在酝酿，对穷兄弟的同情，对恶霸地主的咒骂，几使人忘掉了是在戏场看戏，我真赞叹他们演出的成功。
    府城剧团的演员，都是农会的会员，有些是全家参加的。剧团的领导人，也是村里的干部，如村长就是团长，同时也是演员，他们编演本村的事情，教育了本村人，推动了群众运动，这是府城剧团的第一个特点，也是它发展的方向。此外，据我所知道的，还有两个特点：
    第一、它随着群众运动的发展，不断的编演新剧，如反恶霸时演《森罗殿》；减租债时演《穷人难》，《续穷人难》；春耕时演《生产》；参军时演《小炭锤参军》；开翻身英雄大会时演“翻身英雄续安安”……都是表演本村的事情，推动了中心工作。在焦作清化撤退后，晋城县积极备战，民兵、妇女、儿童，都忙着制火药，打石雷。一个民兵小组上午割灰藁，晚上就演出了《火药库》，他们一面割，一面编，自己演自己的事情，当天演当天的事情，更使备战工作得到顺利的开展。
    第二、不误生产，不增加群众负担。在农忙时他们是白天个别编剧，黑夜集体排演，所有化装、布景等，都很简便，排戏出演，不多花钱。至于如何解决一些零碎的开支，他们决定是明年集体搞些生产，把剧团好好的搞一搞。
