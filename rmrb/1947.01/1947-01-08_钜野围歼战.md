    The Battle of Juancheng Annihilation
    Fang De
    Zhang Lanfeng's Third Detachment direct unit, and the fifth and sixth regiments of the puppet Fourth Column, along with nearly a thousand "returning home corps" and habitual bandits, forming the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, entrenched themselves in Juancheng city, the midpoint of the Heze-Jining highway. They organized a system to slaughter the people, the so-called illegal regimes of Juancheng, Wenshang, Juancheng, and Yuncheng, carrying out bloody massacres and plunder against millions of liberated peasants.

    But the people did not yield. Young and middle-aged people with burning hatred took up arms. When the army counter-attacked the city this time, even the sixty-two-year-old Yu Changjing, with his snow-white hair and beard, carried a rifle and led the team to the front line.

    Juancheng city is surrounded by a moat connected to the Zhu River. The bandits had painstakingly worked on it for two months, building bunkers at key points. Three of the four city gates were blocked, with only the south gate open for entry and exit. A part of the bandits operated around the city, believing that they had equipped Juancheng into an unbreakable tortoise shell.

    On the evening of the 30th, our army stormed in and occupied the four passes around the city. On the 31st, when our infantry fired the fourth shell at the two bunkers in the west pass of the city, only one enemy who was not inside the bunker was still alive to surrender to us. The entire platoon inside the bunker was blown to pieces, men and guns alike. The puppet deputy company commander's Mauser pistol was still on him, but the wooden holster had been blown outside the bunker.

    Before the general assault to scale the city walls, the two hidden bunkers in front of the south five-gate pit, made of crude wooden stakes, were quickly destroyed by our army. A platoon leader who was supervising the battle inside the bunker was blown high into the air, and the soldiers shouted wildly with joy, "The traitor took a plane!" A platoon guarding the bridge north of the city surrendered their guns obediently after our army called out to them. A large bunker on top of the city gate was destroyed by our artillery with two shots.

    The "returning home corps" and puppet soldiers outside the city wanted to escape into the city, but the city would not lower the drawbridge, nor would they open the city gate. They charged towards the east gate, and hand grenades were thrown down from the city wall, killing eight in one pile. More than sixty members of the "returning home corps" in the southwest of the city tried to climb out of the barricades to escape, but were driven back by our fire. Some wanted to burrow into the hidden bunkers at the base of the city gate, but the enemies on the city wall threw down hand grenades to kill them. Only two people ran to our army's position and survived. The evil landlords who had sought refuge with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang thus pitifully buried themselves.

    Before the general attack at 22:00, the enemies around the city were annihilated. Several mountain guns fired, and the soldiers, under the cover of machine guns, raced to be the first to scale the city walls. As a senior commander had predicted: "If the surroundings of the city are cleared, the enemies inside will be as limp as snakes that have seen realgar." In less than an hour, the western half of the city was captured. More than forty bandits in the northeast corner of the city jumped off the city walls in desperation. Before they could even stand firm, they were captured. Some robbed cotton robes from the homes of the villagers and put them on, trying to disguise themselves and escape, but were caught before they could change their trousers. By 3:00 on New Year's Day, all the enemies were besieged in the area of the Catholic Church in the east of the city. The bandits still wanted to "resist." Before the commander could issue the order for the final assault, the frontline communications soldier reported: "The traitors have all surrendered."

    The only ones who were not captured were Zhang Hansan, the puppet county magistrate of Wenshang, and his hundred or so lackeys, who had fled when our army arrived the day before yesterday afternoon.

    钜野围歼战
    方德
    伪四纵队张岚峰第三支队直属队及五、六两个团，另外近千的还乡团和惯匪们组成的蒋家匪帮，盘据我荷济公路中点钜野城内，组织一套屠杀人民的机构，所谓钜野、汶上、鄄城、郓城等非法政权，向百万翻身农民进行着血腥屠杀与掠夺。
    可是人民并没有屈服，内心燃烧着仇恨之火的青壮年都拿起了武器。这次大军反攻该城时，连六十二岁须发如雪的于长敬也扛着长枪领着队伍到前线去了。
    钜野城周有一条与潴水河相通的护城河，土匪们苦心经营两个月，在要害处都有碉堡群，四个城门堵住三个，只开南门出入，并以一部土匪在城周活动，匪徒们满以为这样就把钜野装备成一个不可击破的龟壳了。
    三十日晚上我军一举攻入，占了城周四关，三十一日当我们的步兵向城西关的两个碉堡射击到第四发炮弹的时候，只有一个不在碉堡内的敌人还活着来投降我们，在碉堡内的一个排人枪都炸碎了，伪副连长的盒子枪还在身上，可是木壳子都炸飞到碉堡外面去了。
    在登城总攻以前，南五门坑前的道粗木桩作成的鹿砦门前东西两个暗堡，被我军迅速摧毁，在碉堡内督战的一个排长被掀到半天空，战士们乐得狂叫“汉奸坐了飞机啦！”城北看守桥梁的一个排在我军喊话后，也很恭顺地交枪投降了。城门顶上的一个大碉堡被我们的炮兵两炮给打掉了。
    在城外的还乡团及伪军们想逃进城内，但是城上不敢放下吊桥，也不敢开城门，他们向东门冲，城墙上就扔下手榴弹，一堆就炸死了八个。在城西南的六十多个还乡团从鹿砦里想爬出来逃跑，却被我们打了回去，有的想钻进城门根的暗堡里，城墙上的敌人却又扔下手榴弹来炸死他们，只有两个人跑到我军阵地才算留了一条活命，投靠蒋家匪帮的恶霸地主们就这样可怜地葬送了自己。
    二十二点总攻击前，城周的敌人就这样被歼灭了，几声山炮响起，战士们在机枪掩护下面，争着抢先登城。正如某高级指挥员所预料的那样：“把城周围搞光了，里面的敌人就像蛇见了雄黄一样会软得发瘫的。”不到一个钟头就夺得了西半个城，城东北角的四十多个匪徒们急得跳城墙，还没有站稳脚跟就被捉住了，有的到老乡家里抢了棉袍穿上要化装潜逃，都未换裤子就被抓住了，到元旦三时所有敌人全被围困在东城天主教堂一带，匪徒们还要“抵抗”，指挥员最后总攻的命令还没有下达的时候，前线通讯员来报告：“汉奸们全部投降了。”
    没有被捉住的只有前天午后我大军来到就跑了的伪汶上县县长张汉三和他率领的百多个喽罗。
