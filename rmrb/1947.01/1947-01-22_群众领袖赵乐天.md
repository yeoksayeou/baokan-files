　　People's Leader Zhao Letian
　　Tie Min
　　At the county-level book liaison meeting, Kunshan reported on Comrade Zhao Letian, a model worker in the Anshan District, who took the lead in joining the army. I asked him, "You led sixty-three people to join the army all at once. How do you usually connect with the masses so well?" He replied, "I don't have any special skills, I just do what I say, and I do my best to help the masses with small things. When the work hasn't been recognized by the masses, I wait a bit, without resorting to coercion or commands." Everyone was very moved to hear these three points, feeling that his spirit of serving the people and his leadership methods were very good and that they should learn from him. Comrade Zhao Letian is thirty-eight years old. I saw him in the turn-over group. Dressed in military uniform, he still showed the very kind nature of a peasant. When talking, his face was full of smiles, and his attitude was both gentle and sincere. He told me his history, saying: "My family was very poor when I was young. After following my grandfather to private school for a few years, I started a small business in Anshan town, carrying a basket, but it wasn't enough to support my family, so I had to go to Jinan Qianfeng Qianzhuang to learn business. Being an apprentice was really bitter, serving people 'humbly'. At first, they didn't even provide food. I was very upset and cried a lot in secret, but I managed to endure it for seven months before quitting and returning home, and then I started a small business again. I fell down, I got up, stumbling up and down." When the Eighth Route Army came and removed the Anshan strongholds (traitor strongholds), I thought the days of liberation had arrived, so I happily and actively participated in the farmers' association. The masses elected me as the director of the town farmers' association, and soon I left production to become the organization minister of the Anshan District trade union. This year, I also brought sixty-three masses from my village who had turned over to join the army. Now I am serving as a platoon leader." At this point, I shook his hand and immediately asked him cordially: "Comrade, please tell me why the masses support you so much?" He replied simply: "I don't have any other strengths, I'm just honest. I often think that to correct others, one must first correct oneself. One must stand upright and be stable." I also asked him to talk about how the enlistment in Anshan town was so enthusiastic this time, with everyone responding to the call. He said, "When the conscription work arrived, I first thought about myself, asking myself if I was willing to join the army, if I should join the army. I usually serve the masses, and now, seeing that the Jiang bandits are about to trample the liberated masses under their feet, how can I continue to serve the masses and protect the interests of the masses? The only way is to take the lead in joining the army myself. Once I had no problems with my own thoughts, I persuaded my father, and then I mobilized the masses." Talking about this, he took out a small booklet of turn-over principles from his hand to show me. He said, "I used the principles in this booklet to explain to them, and I let them think about how they turned over themselves, and based on the materials about Zhang Fengji before and after liberation in the newspaper and what they saw with their own eyes in Jinan city about the situation of family members who withdrew, I let them think about what would happen to us if the Jiang bandits came. Would we have good days? If no one joins the army, can we repel the Jiang bandits' attack? Finally, I expressed my attitude to the masses, that I was determined to join the army. My sixty-three-year-old grandfather also wanted to go. You all think about it, plan it out, what do you want to do? Everyone started talking, some went to ask my father, and he said, "Not only is Letian going, but I am also determined to join the army. I can't stay at home waiting for Lao Jiang to destroy us." As a result, many people were eager to join the army. I also told them that it was best to discuss it properly with their families and get their family's consent, so that everyone would be more motivated and happier." Comrade Guo Zhongren, the person in charge of Letian's district, said: "Because Letian has suffered and endured all kinds of hardships, he is very considerate of the hardships of the masses, is conscientious and responsible to the masses, and goes day and night, rain or shine, to solve problems. Therefore, the masses are constantly looking for him, and he is surrounded by the masses wherever he goes. The masses often ask him to 'cure hunger,' so he tries to set up cooperatives, transportation teams, and plan production together with the masses." He is very busy all day long, and the district cadres who work with him all say, "I don't know what's going on, Zhao the Blind's (he's nearsighted) affairs are so numerous?" He runs more than ten miles in the middle of the night to solve problems for the masses. "Why are you acting like you're crazy? Can't you put it off and go solve it tomorrow?" But he firmly replied, "I promised people, I can't break my promise." His sincerity is very touching. Because he has suffered a lot of hardships and has rich social experience, he is very patient in handling problems. When disputes occur among the masses, he first lets both sides talk separately, and then listens to public opinion before making a judgment, so he is very popular with the masses.

　　群众领袖赵乐天
    铁民
    在县书联席会上，昆山汇报到安山小区模范工作者赵乐天同志的带头参军。我曾问他说：“你一下子就带领六十三个群众参军，到底你平常怎么和群众联系的这样好呢？”他回答：“我没有别的本事，就是能说到那里办到那里，群众有小的事咱也尽心给他办。当工作还没被群众认识到的时候咱等待一下，不用强迫命令”。就是这三点，大家听了都很受感动，觉得他这种为人民服务的精神和领导方法都很好，应该向他学习。赵乐天同志现年三十八岁，我在翻身团看见他的。他穿着军装仍显出一个非常善良的农民本色，谈话时满面笑容，态度既温和而又恳切。他告诉我他的历史说：“我小时家里很穷，跟着我爷爷上几年私塾后，就在安山镇街上提篮子做小生意，但不够家里生活，只得上济宁钱丰钱号去学买卖。当学徒真苦死了，“低三下四”地侍候人家。开头还不管饭吃，自己难过的很，背地里哭了好多场，好歹地将就了七个月才辞掉回家，又干起小生意来。自己摔倒、自己爬，叽哩“骨碌”地三起三落。八路军过来拔了安山钉子（汉奸据点），我想可到了翻身的日子，就高高兴兴积极地参加农会，群众选咱当了镇农会主任，不久又脱离生产，当安山小区工会组织部长。今年我又带着本村一块翻身的群众六十三人来参军，现在我担任一排长”这时我握住他的手，紧接着就亲切地追问：“同志，请告诉我群众为什么那样的拥护你呢”？他回答很简单：“咱别的长处没有，就是个实在。我常想正人先要正己，自己要站的正，立的稳”。我又要求他谈谈这次安山镇参军怎么搞的那样轰轰烈烈，一呼百应。他说：“扩军工作到来的时候，我先从自己身上想起，问问自己是不是愿意参军，是不是应该参军。平时自己为群众服务，现在眼看着蒋贼要把翻身的群众踏在他脚底下，自己怎样再继续为群众服务，保卫群众利益，就只有自己首先带头参军。自身想的没问题了，又动员好我爹，然后再动员群众”。谈到这里，他从手里取出一本翻身道理的小册子来给我看，他说：“我就参照这个本子的道理，讲给他们听，并让他们各人想想自己怎样翻的身，又根据报纸上张凤集解放前后的材料和他们亲眼看到的济宁市退出家属的情形，让他们想蒋贼来了咱怎么办，是不是有咱的好日子？没有人参军能不能打退蒋贼的进攻？最后向群众表明自己的态度，我也决心参军。我六十三岁的老爷也要去。您们各人想想，打算一下，自己想怎么办？大家都叽咕起来，有的找我爹去问，他老人家说：“不光乐天去，我也要坚决参军，不能在家等着老蒋毁坏咱”。这样一来，好多人都急着要参军。我又向他们讲最好和自己家里商量妥当才行，取得家庭同意，大家走的就是更带劲、更高兴”。乐天同志那个区的负责人郭忠任同志说：“由于乐天吃过苦，受尽了折磨，所以他很能体贴群众的疾苦，对群众认真负责，不分昼夜，风雨无阻地去解决问题，因而群众找他的整天接连不断，他走到那里群众就把他围起来，群众常常找他“治饿病”，他就设法成立合作社，运输队，和群众一起计划生产”。他整天忙碌的很，和他在一块工作的区干部都这样讲：“也不知怎么闹的，赵瞎子（他是近视眼）的事这么多”？他半夜一跑十几里，为群众解决问题。“你怎么和疯了的一样，搁搁明天再去解决不行哩？”但他坚决的回答：“与人家说好了，不能失信”。他的真诚很使人感动。因为他受的折磨多，社会经验丰富，处理问题非常耐心。群众发生了纷，他是先分别让双方谈，再听取群众舆论后，才来判断，所以很得群众拥护。
