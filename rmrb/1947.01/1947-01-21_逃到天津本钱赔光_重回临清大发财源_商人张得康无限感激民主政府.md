　　Fled to Tianjin and Lost All Capital
    Returned to Linqing and Made a Fortune
    Businessman Zhang Dekang Endlessly Grateful to the Democratic Government
    [This article was] transmitted from Weixian on the 17th of this month by our newspaper. Linqing merchant Zhang Dekang became wealthy with the help of government loans and the trade union. Zhang Dekang, the owner of the "En Xing Cheng" restaurant on Ma Shi Street in the city, ran away with tens of thousands of yuan from the till last February in the lunar calendar because four of his employees requested a wage increase, which he refused. He planned to return and run the business himself after the employees left. He went to Tianjin and started his own business. From the end of February to September, he lost all his money, including the principal and interest, and could barely afford food and clothing. However, the four employees he had fired, with the help of 50,000 yuan invested by the Farmers' Association, reopened the original business under the new name "Tong Xin Cheng". From February to September, they made a profit of 200,000 yuan, with a dividend of 250% on the shares. Zhang Dekang lost his capital in Tianjin and had to return to Linqing. He didn't dare to go out after returning. Thinking that his family relied on business for a living, he couldn't just hide away. So he asked someone to intercede with the trade union, personally apologized to the trade union, and apologized to the employees. The trade union knew that he had been temporarily confused and had gone down the wrong path, so they didn't hold a grudge and lent him another 50,000 yuan from the bank, and "En Xing Cheng" was returned to him. The old owner, old employees, old storefront, and old furniture were all there, but with a new mindset. So the employees worked tirelessly all day long, and Zhang Dekang boldly entrusted the business to the employees and joined in the labor himself. The accountant, Yang Huantang, said, "We must work hard and not let the owner increase the capital in vain, nor let the trade union lose face." Zhang Dekang said gratefully, "I used to be stubborn and didn't give my employees a raise. The trade union not only didn't punish me but also helped me do business, so that my family could eat well and dress warmly." In the half-month since opening on November 5th in the solar calendar, Zhang Dekang not only repaid 100,000 yuan in debt, but also provided his family of five with ample food and drink, increased the employees' wages and cotton clothing by 17,500 yuan, and still made a net profit of 200,000 yuan. "Only by doing business in the liberated areas can you make a fortune" has become Zhang Dekang's mantra.

　　逃到天津本钱赔光
    重回临清大发财源
    商人张得康无限感激民主政府
    【本报威县十七日电】在政府贷款、工会协助下，临清商人张得康发财致富。该市马市街“恩兴诚”饭铺东家张得康因去年阴历二月四个伙计要求增资，他不愿意，便把柜上几万块钱拿着跑了；他打算店员都走了以后，自己回来再干。他跑到天津，自己作起买卖来。自二月底到九月，几万块钱连本带利都烂了，自己也弄得衣食无着。可是他解雇的四个伙计，却在农会集股投资五万元的帮助下，使原字号重新开张，改名“同心成”。从二月到九月共赢利二十万元，股金分红百分之二百五十。张得康在天津赔了本，不得不返回临清。回来后还不敢出门。心想一家人靠买卖吃饭，光藏着不是办法。遂托人到工会说情，亲自到工会认错，并且向店员们道了歉。工会知道他一时迷糊，走错了路，不念旧恶，又从银行贷给他五万元，“恩兴诚”仍旧归了他。旧东家、旧伙计、旧门面、旧家具，只是换了个新脑筋。于是伙计们整天手脚不闲，张得康大胆的把买卖靠给伙计，自己也参加劳动。管账先生杨焕堂说：“可得好好干、不能叫东家白增了资，不能叫工会丢了人。”张得康感激的说：“我以前顽固，不给伙计增资，工会不但不处罚，反帮助我做买卖，使一家人吃饭穿暖。”从阳历十一月五号开门后个半月中，张得康除还了十万元的欠账外，一家大小五口人吃喝丰裕又给伙计增棉衣工资一万七千五百元，还净赚二十万元。“只有在解放区做生意才能发财”，成了张得康的口头禅。
