　　Developing Sideline Occupations to Accumulate Capital
    Various Areas in Southern Hebei Prepare for Large-Scale Production
    Resolving Various Difficulties in Spring Plowing
    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County on the 13th] "Accumulate strength for reproduction, lay the foundation for large-scale production." Qiu County and Qi County are greatly developing winter sideline occupations. After two months of leveling the land movement, Qiu County has achieved "land to the tiller," but due to the great disaster in 1943, agricultural tools flowed out excessively. Although the masses obtained land, they still face many difficulties in production. The leadership, combined with the demands of the masses, decided to focus on sideline production in January and February, preparing capital for large-scale production, and provided loans of 14 million yuan to strongly support it. The entire county is now organizing a large number of small cooperatives, mainly based on labor, adopting diverse forms to carry out transportation, milling, oil pressing, cotton ginning, salt leaching, etc., putting forward the resounding slogan of "Do whatever is profitable!" Women are launching a spinning and weaving competition: "Every family is busy, every household is filled with the sound of looms." Liu Manzhai in the Second District of Qi County has a total of 175 households, and 151 households participated in the emancipation movement, recovering 230 mu of land, with each person leveling three mu of land. Currently, the masses have shifted to winter production in order to plant the "roots of wealth." Hu Qinglin leads the masses in cotton ginning and is also preparing to open oil presses and steamed bun shops. The masses are now brewing and planning spring plowing work.
    [Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 13th] After the emancipation movement, various areas in Southern Hebei are enthusiastically carrying out winter production and preparing for this year's large-scale production. After the Jiudian Mutual Aid Team in Guangzong formulated a winter production plan, in 26 days, eight groups leached more than 1,300 catties of salt, earning more than 400,000 yuan. Wang Qu, who is in her sixties, leads three spinning and weaving groups, weaving more than 40 bolts of cloth and earning 180,000 yuan. In Li Machang Village, Ji Ze County, the spinning and weaving group led by female labor hero Chang Lanxiu and women's association chairman Chang Lingqin has grown from 13 people to 24 people, selling cloth for a total of 275,000 yuan. After the rent reduction movement in Shaohua Village, Zaoqiang County, the entire village turned to winter production, pooling 110,000 yuan to open an oil press, estimating that by the end of the old year, each share could buy about one mu of land. The Sixth District of Ji County is universally carrying out a winter plowing movement. The entire village is mobilized, using more than 80 plows, plowing more than ten hectares of land in five days, making spring sowing no longer a problem. Farmers in Yang Village, Seventh District of Yuanzhao, have planted more than 3,600 small trees from the struggle as winter hawthorns, which the masses call "planting wealth seedlings." The entire village of Shenzhuang in the Second District of Qinghe is organized for winter production, earning 20,000 yuan a month. The cigarette rolling cooperative organized by Zhang Zonggang and others can earn 200,000 yuan by the end of the year. Wen Dingguo, a landlord in Hou Wenji, Fifth District of Yuanzhao, had a wife and children and lived a corrupt life in the past. After this mass movement, the village cadres educated him, and he became diligent. He and his son get up early and go to bed late, picking up firewood and manure, and also persuaded his wife and daughter-in-law to spin and weave. He has now picked up more than three dan of manure and is actively preparing for large-scale production.
