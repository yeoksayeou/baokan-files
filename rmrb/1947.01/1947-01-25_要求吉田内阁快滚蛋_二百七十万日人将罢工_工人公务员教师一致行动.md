(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 13th to the 23rd: The movement to oust the Yoshida cabinet in Japan is unfolding in full swing. After Yoshida's impetuous clamoring in his New Year's broadcast that workers were "illegal elements," it immediately aroused the indignation of workers throughout Japan. Representatives of various labor unions protested to the cabinet on the 6th and demanded that he apologize. After Yoshida refused this request, the fuse for the first nationwide general strike in Japanese history was lit. The Joint Struggle Committee announced on the 19th that it would launch a nationwide strike of 2.7 million people on February 1st to demand that the Yoshida cabinet get out. Participating in this strike are the unions of national railway workers, transportation workers, and government and public institutions. The Japanese Communist Party and the industrial unions led by the Japanese Communist Party also announced their support. Once this general strike erupts, Japanese industry will be paralyzed as a result. Therefore, Yoshida could not but use the conspiracy of "concessions" in an attempt to win over the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party and partially reorganize the cabinet to ease the anti-cabinet movement. However, when the negotiations between Socialist Party leader Nishio and Yoshida and Shidehara had not yet yielded results on the 16th, MacArthur suddenly announced that Socialist Party right-wing leaders Rikizo Hirano and Komakichi Matsuoka were not qualified to participate in the cabinet, immediately making the Socialist Party see that this negotiation was a fraud, a double act staged by MacArthur and Yoshida. After the negotiations stalled, what followed was a demonstration by 15,000 civil servant representatives on the 19th, and a resolution at the meeting held to participate in the February 1st general strike. The Federation of Teachers' Associations also announced on the same day that classes would also be suspended on February 1st. Postal and telegraph workers will support by stopping delivery.

Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Kobe and other major Japanese cities have been plunged into a state of semi-death due to the shutdown of gas and tap water.

　　要求吉田内阁快滚蛋
    二百七十万日人将罢工
    工人公务员教师一致行动
    【本报综合报导】据新华社十三日至廿三日电讯：日本倒吉田内阁运动正如火如荼展开。吉田在今年新年广播中浮燥的叫嚣说工人是“非法分子”后，立即引起全日本工人的愤激，各工会代表于六日向内阁抗议并要求他道歉。在吉田拒绝这个要求后，日本有史以来的全国总罢工的引线便点燃了，联合斗争委员会，十九号宣布决于二月一日举行二百七十万人的全国大罢工，以要求吉田内阁滚蛋。参加此次罢工的有国营铁路工人、交通工人，政府机关及公共机关等工会。日共及日共领导下的产业工会也宣布支持。这个大罢工一旦爆发，日本工业将因之陷于停滞。因而吉田不能不用“让步”的阴谋，企图拉拢社会党的右翼领袖，局部改组内阁以缓和倒阁运动。但是，十六日社会党领袖西尾与吉田币原的谈判，还未得到结果的时候，麦克阿瑟却突然宣布社会党右派领袖平野力三和松冈驹吉没有参加内阁的资格，马上使社会党人看出了这个谈判是个骗局，是麦克阿瑟和吉田串演的一幕双簧把戏。谈判停顿后，随之而来的是十九日一万五千公务员代表游行示威，并于所举行之大会上决议参加二一总罢工。各学校教师联合会也于同日宣布二月一日亦将停课。邮政电报工人将用停止寄递来赞助。
    东京，横滨、大坂、名古屋、神户等日本大都市，已因烁气、自来水的停顿，陷于半死状态之中。
