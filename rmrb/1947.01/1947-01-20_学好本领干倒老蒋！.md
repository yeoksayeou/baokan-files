　　Yushe Militia Recall History
　　Initiate a Conscious Military Training Movement
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] To enhance combat skills and defend the liberated life, the Yushe militia are enthusiastically conducting winter military training. In Da＠ Village, Fourth District, the turned-over militia's learning enthusiasm is extremely high. They get up early to run, practice bayonet drills, and shooting in shifts, and participate in production in the morning; practice aiming and explosions in the afternoon; and attend political classes in the evening. The main content is to recall history, awaken class consciousness, and create a conscious military training movement. Miao Dushu said in a political class: "The landlord dogs, they would pluck anyone with hair on their body. If we don't want them to come and squeeze our oil again, we can only practice our martial arts well and overthrow the landlord boss Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan." The military training movement in the Second and Third Districts has been popularized in all large and small villages in the district, and most of the young and middle-aged people have automatically joined the movement. The militiamen happily sing: "Open your minds and recognize clearly, this year's military training is very important, everyone learns a set of good skills, defeats the reactionary army of Chiang and Yan, and can protect the good life." In order to promptly learn from each other's strengths, overcome weaknesses, and exchange experiences, they gathered all the militia in the district for a large competition. In addition to conducting bayonet, shooting, and explosion drills with the joint defense as a unit, they also conducted field combat exercises. As a result, Qingxiu Joint Defense won first place. This joint defense mainly adopted the method of centralized coaching and decentralized self-study. Under the active leadership of retired soldiers Wang Maozhong and Xu Shenggui, the Xia Chiyu Joint Defense won second place. Now, all regions are actively practicing hard to improve their skills and strive to become a model for the next military training competition. (Yushe Militia News)
    Lingchuan Militia Military Training Competition
　　[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] The Lingchuan militia are stepping up military training to prepare for the new task of recovering lost territory in 1947. Since the enemy occupied Jiaozuo, the county's militia has launched military training competitions in grenade throwing, bayonet fighting, aiming, and mine laying; Shahe and Yongyi towns have set off two upsurges, and each militiaman has reached the level of proficiency where they can complete more than 20 kinds of mine-making and mine-laying methods with their eyes closed. After the Changzhi Heroes' Conference, the county's militia heroes brought the various new military training methods learned at the conference to the militia. Militiamen in various places are extremely interested in the new methods of placing and pulling mines. A militiaman in a certain district said: "We have learned so many mine-making methods, we will set up a minefield when the Chiang-puppet army comes, and blow the dog days to pieces." Another militiaman asked the county cadres: "When will Jiaozuo be recovered? We are willing to collectively participate in the war and eliminate the Chiang-puppet army in 1947." (Hairu)
