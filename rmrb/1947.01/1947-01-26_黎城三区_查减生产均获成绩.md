    Licheng Third District
    Significant Achievements in Land Reform and Production

    [Report from our newspaper in Licheng] The land reform inspection in the Third District has been successfully completed, and now the fruits are being distributed, vigorously transitioning to production. The district combined land reform with winter production, launching a "cutting off the feudal tails" movement throughout the district starting in December. In backward villages such as Langpo, where land reform was the priority, emphasis was placed on patiently mobilizing honest peasants and "old wives and old men" lagging behind, changing the cadres' style of underestimating the "backward" and becoming detached from the masses. Villages like Majiayu broke the old middle peasant mentality of "cutting chives" (i.e., only giving up the minimum), enlightened new middle peasants with the class consciousness of "don't forget the pain after the scars have healed," united all the peasants, uprooted poverty, and cut off the feudal tails. Over 80% of the women in the district participated in the struggle. According to statistics from four villages including Qiushuyuan in Langpo, 470 poor peasants obtained 7.06 hectares of land, more than 300 houses, and a large number of livestock and farm tools. The families of military personnel received full care. After leveling the bumps, the peasants who had been emancipated actively joined farmers' associations and militia. In 17 villages, including Changning and Langpo, 105 new militiamen were added, and 416 new members joined the farmers' association, including more than 20 women who actively joined the militia to practice martial arts, determined to defend the fruits of their struggle. On the 4th of this month, the district held a meeting of key cadres from various villages to study how to distribute the fruits of victory, organize production, and overcome the mentality of some masses who were waiting to eat the fruits of the struggle. They put forward the slogan "Better to earn a living than to sit and eat" and "Don't eat dead water (fruits), eat living water!" mobilizing the emancipated masses to actively transition to production. In Qiushuyuan Village, in the very short free time before the distribution of the fruits of victory, they used livestock to transport goods, earned money, and bought six head of livestock from Hebei, selling them to the masses at the original price to solve production difficulties. Cadres in Xianglu not only distributed the fruits but also organized and led production, turning dead water into living water. They organized eight textile groups with 45 people, eight firewood cutting groups, four carrying groups, two transportation groups, and four flour mills, immediately transitioning to winter production. When the land reform movement ended, statistics from 17 villages in the district showed that a total of 61 small-scale cooperatives, 49 workshops of various types, 121 textile groups with 1,060 people, 35 transportation groups with 251 livestock, six cart teams, and 45 firewood cutting groups were organized, earning a profit of over 4.92 million yuan. Now the entire district has generally transitioned to production, launching a village-to-village competition.

    黎城三区
    查减生产均获成绩
    【本报黎城讯】此间三区翻身检查，已胜利完成，现正分配果实，大力转入生产。该区查减与冬季生产结合，从十二月开始在全区掀起割尾巴运动。在以查减为重点的榔坡等落后村，着重耐心发动老实农民和老婆老汉等落后层，转变了干部轻视“落后”脱离群众作风。马家峪等村打破旧中农“割韭菜”思想，启发新中农“揭了伤疤别忘痛”的阶级觉悟，团结全体农民，刨了穷根，割了封建尾巴。全区百分之八十以上妇女群众卷入斗争。据榔坡秋树垣等四村统计，有四百七十户贫苦农民得到七顷零六亩土地，三百多间房屋和大批牲口农具。军属得到充分照顾。经填平圪瘩后，翻身农民，纷纷加入农会、民兵。长宁、榔坡等十七村，新增加民兵一百零五名，新增农会员四百十六名，其中有二十多名妇女积极加入民兵练武，决心保卫果实。本月四日，该区召开各村主要干部会议，研究如何分配果实，组织生产，克服部分群众等待斗争果实吃饭思想，提出“坐吃不如走吃”“不吃死水（果实）要吃活水！”口号，动员翻身群众积极转入生产。秋树垣村在分配果实前很短空闲时间，利用牲口驮脚，赚下钱从河北买下六头牲口，原价卖给群众解决生产困难。香炉＠干部一面分果实，一面组织领导生产，利用死水变成活水。组织了八个纺织组四十五人，八个割柴组，四个担挑组，两个运输组，及四座粉坊，立即转入冬季生产。当查减运动结束，全区十七个村统计：共组织小型合作社六十一座，各种作坊四十九座，纺织一百二十一组，一千六十人，运输三十五组，牲口二百五十一头，大车六组，割柴四十五组共得利四百九十二万余元。现在全区已普遍转向生产，展开了村与村的竞赛。
