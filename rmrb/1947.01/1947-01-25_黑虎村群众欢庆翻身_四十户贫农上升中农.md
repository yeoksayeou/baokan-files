　　Black Tiger Village Celebrates Liberation
    Forty Poor Peasant Households Rise to Middle Peasant Status
    [This newspaper, PingShun News] After a month of checking and liberation movement, Black Tiger Village in the Seventh District has achieved complete liberation. A total of 262.27 mu of land, 110 houses, 36 livestock, 221 shi of grain, and many other farm tools and furniture have been recovered. Eighty percent of the households in the village have benefited. On average, each poor peasant has 3.68 mu of land. Forty poor peasant households have risen to middle peasant status. The villagers held a mass meeting on December 29 to celebrate their liberation. During the liberation recollections, the masses happily expressed their inner joy. Poor peasant Ma Zhifu said, "In the eight years of the War of Resistance, this is the first time I have completely turned myself around, gaining land, houses, and grain. Chairman Mao's policy is really good. He cares about us even more than our own family members." After liberation, Fu Kui's mother put on a new cotton-padded coat and said, "My liberation has reached the mountaintop!" Middle peasant Xu Tuncang said, "My three family members have more than nine mu of land and more than three shi of grain left over each year. Others call me 'old rich,' and I was afraid of struggle in my heart. But after the struggle, I was also given a sheep and a cabinet. I am really happy. I will definitely get up early to collect manure in the future." Rich middle peasant Song Hexing said, "At the beginning of the investigation and rent reduction, I had the idea of cutting chives [taking small advantages]. Now that I have straightened out my thinking, I must work hard in production in the future." Elderly military family member Ma Huiyuan said, "I have been completely liberated. Land, houses, and livestock have all been distributed to me. They even distributed a clay slab bed to me. I am really overjoyed."
    At the liberation recollection meeting, everyone said that this liberation was due to the efforts of the leaders. Xu Fulai, Liu Xuewen (retired soldier), and Wu Xiaochou were selected as liberation heroes, and Ma Tiantun and Ma Tiancheng were selected as model cadres. Fifteen activists were selected and rewarded with towels and other items. (Wang Bailin)
