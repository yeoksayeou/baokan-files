Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang, December 31st: Since Hu Zongnan brazenly invaded our Lüliang Liberated Area, our Liberation Army first annihilated one of his regiments in the Battle of Wucheng, then ambushed his column advancing towards Daning around Puxian and annihilated one of his battalions. Hu's army's flanks were completely exposed, causing great panic, and they retreated from Daning towards Linfen and Puxian. On the night of the 30th, our army took the initiative to attack again in the area west of Puxian, annihilating the entire 67th Brigade Headquarters, the entire 200th Regiment, and part of the 99th Regiment. The spoils of war are currently being inventoried.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang Front, January 1st: Chiang's army from Linfen and Jixian, divided into three routes, attempted to probe into Xixian and Yonghe, and flank the five American-equipped brigades (formerly divisions) of Chiang's army towards Yan'an, but were met with a strong resistance from the local Eighth Route Army. As of the 30th, one brigade headquarters, one regiment, and four battalions had been completely annihilated. The Chiang army, a total of five brigades (all transferred from Shaanxi), under the command of Dong Zhao, the commander of Chiang's First Army (formerly the commander-in-chief of the 28th Army Group), advanced in three routes. The middle route consisted of the First Brigade of the First Division (reorganized after being annihilated in Fushan), the 165th Brigade, and the 61st Brigade of the 90th Division, advancing westward along the Linfen-Daning Highway. They occupied Tumen (forty miles west of Linfen) on the 15th, Heilongguan and Hualezhen (fifty-five miles east of Puxian) on the 18th, and the Eighth Route Army automatically withdrew from Puxian city on the 19th. By the 21st, their vanguard had reached Guduo Village, thirty miles northwest of Puxian. They occupied Wucheng (sixty miles northwest of Puxian) on the 22nd and suffered heavy casualties from strong attacks by the Eighth Route Army along the way. The left route consisted of the 47th Brigade of the 25th Division and part of the 78th Brigade of the First Division, advancing northward from Jixian on the 19th. This route of Chiang's army was resisted by the local military and civilians for six days, advancing only thirty miles. On the 24th, the main force of the Eighth Route Army withdrew from Heshangling, thirty miles north of Jixian. The right route consisted of the 53rd Brigade of the 90th Division and one regiment of the 67th Brigade of the 30th Division, advancing from Linfen, Hongdong, and Zhaocheng towards Puyubei and Shimenshan, fifty miles northeast of Puxian, on the 18th. After the Chiang army invaded a certain area, the Eighth Route Army launched a counterattack. On the morning of the 24th, after killing more than a hundred enemies at Shanglonghua, thirty miles east of Bicheng, they immediately attacked Beijiandi Village, annihilating one battalion of the 16th Regiment of the 61st Brigade. At the same time, another unit of the Eighth Route Army attacked Gaojiazhuang, twenty miles northeast of Wucheng, eliminating one battalion of the 183rd Regiment of Chiang's 61st Brigade. On the 26th, they ambushed a Chiang army transport team, annihilating the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Chiang's First Brigade, and captured more than three hundred mules and horses and one hundred carts loaded with ammunition, supplies, and communications equipment. At this time, a unit of the Eighth Route Army had maneuvered to the rear of the Chiang army, attacking its transportation and communication lines, and on the night of the 24th, they attacked Heilongguan, a key pass between Puxian and Linfen, cutting off its rear route and killing and capturing more than eighty Chiang soldiers. On the 25th, a truck and some mules and carts loaded with military supplies were intercepted at Heigou, south of Heilongguan, and at Nangou, ten miles east of Puxian. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 1,500 Chiang soldiers, including the chief of the Quartermaster Department of the First Division, were killed or captured, and six cannons, six heavy machine guns, twenty light machine guns, more than one hundred rifles, and a large amount of ammunition and military supplies were seized. The Chiang army in the middle route, after suffering this heavy blow, realized that our encirclement was tightening day by day, and began to retreat in panic on the 26th. Part of it was heavily besieged by the Eighth Route Army on the line of Wucheng, Xueguan, and Jinggou in Puxian on the afternoon of the 30th. After two hours of fierce fighting, the headquarters of Chiang's 61st Brigade (formerly a division), the entire 200th Regiment, and one battalion of the 199th Regiment were completely annihilated. The results of the battle are being inventoried. Thousands of people in the area, newly liberated from the brutal rule of Yan Xishan, are fully supporting the front lines. The morale of the Eighth Route Army is extremely high, and after this blow, the morale of the Chiang army has collapsed, and they dare not enter villages at night. The stubborn Yan Xishan burned tables, chairs, doors, and windows on the mountains to keep warm.

    【新华社吕梁三十一日电】胡宗南悍然进犯我吕梁解放区以来，我解放军先后在午城镇一役，歼灭其一个团，继在蒲县周围侧击其进犯大宁之纵队而歼灭其一个营后，胡部侧翼全部暴露，大起恐慌，即纷纷自大宁向临汾、蒲县方向溃退。我军乃于三十日夜再于蒲县以西地带主动出击，当将其六十七旅旅部、二○○团全部及九十九团之一部予以歼灭，战利品正清查中。
    【新华社吕梁前线一日电】临汾吉县分三路北犯，企图进窥隰县、永和，并侧击延安之蒋军五个美械旅（原师），遭当地八路军有力阻击。截至三十日止，已有一个旅部及一个团又四个营全部被歼。此次进犯之蒋军共五个旅兵力（皆由陕调来），在蒋第一军军长（原二十八集团军总司令）董钊指挥下，分三路进犯。其中路为第一师之第一旅（原在浮山被歼后抓丁编凑而成）、一六五旅、九十师之六一旅沿临（汾）大（宁）公路西犯，十五日侵占土门（临汾西四十里），十八日侵占黑龙关、化乐镇（蒲县东五十五里），十九日八路军自动撤出蒲县城，至二十一日其先头部队进至蒲县西北三十里之古铎村。二十二日侵占午城镇（蒲县西北六十里），沿路即遭八路军有力打击，死伤颇重。左翼一路为二十五师之四七旅及第一师之七八旅一部，于十九日由吉县北犯。该路蒋军沿途遭当地军民阻击六天，只前进三十里。二十四日，八路军主力撤出吉县北三十余里之和尚岭。右翼一路为九十师之五三旅及卅师之六七旅一个团，于十八日分由临（汾）、洪（洞）、赵（城）向蒲县东北五十里蒲峪、石门山一带进犯，八路军待蒋军侵入一定地区后，奋起反击。廿四日清晨，在辟城东卅里之上龙化毙敌百余名后，当即袭入北监底村，歼灭敌六一旅一六团一个营。同时，八路军另一部攻入午城东北二十里之高家庄，消灭蒋军六一旅一八三团一个营。二十六日，在伏击蒋军运输队歼灭蒋军第一旅三团第三营，缴获满载弹药给养及通讯器材之骡马三百余头，大车百辆。在此时，八路军某部已机动地挺进至蒋军后方，打击其交通运输，于二十四日夜攻入蒲县、临汾间之要隘黑龙关，横断其后路，毙俘蒋军八十余名。二十五日，在黑龙关南之黑狗及在蒲县东十里之南沟，截获满载军需之汽车一辆及骡马大车一部。据不完全统计，此次共毙俘蒋军第一师军需处长以下千五百余名，缴获各种炮六门，重机枪六挺，轻机枪二十挺，步枪百余支，及弹药军需品甚多。中路蒋军受此痛击，发现我包围日益紧缩，乃于二十六日起仓惶撤退。其一部于三十日下午在蒲县午城、薛关、井沟一线陷入八路军重围，经两小时激战，蒋军六十一旅（原师）旅直及所属二百团全部与一九九团之一个营全部被歼，战果正清查中。该区新由阎顽暴政下解放的数千人民，正以全力支援前线。八路军士气极盛，蒋军经此次打击后，军心溃散，夜间不敢进村，顽阎于山头焚烧桌椅门窗以取暖。
