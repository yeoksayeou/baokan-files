Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 20th: Comprehensive Weekly War Report (January 12th to 18th): This week's war report shows that Chiang Kai-shek's offensives on all fronts have become chaotic and full of loopholes. This is the real reason why Chiang Kai-shek is rehashing his old "peace" tune.

In the Ji-Lu-Yu region, Chiang's troops are in a passive position on both fronts. After recovering Juye and Jiaxiang, Liu Bocheng's troops advanced south to the Jinxiang, Yutai, and Shanxian areas, striking invading Chiang's troops and recovering lost territories. In order to salvage the defeat, Gu Zhutong ordered the Chiang puppet troops in Heze and Dingtao to attack eastward in two routes, but both were annihilated. The Mi Wenhe, Liu Ruzhen, and Zhang Lanfeng units suffered losses of over 10,000 men, and Chengwu County was also recovered on the 16th. The Chiang's troops guarding Heze, Dingtao, Caoxian and other places are now weak. In addition, the Chiang's Fifth Army and the 85th Division and other units that invaded the Ji'nan-Yu'bei area have been forced to rely on northeastern Henan as their rear and gradually retreat because their rear route in western Shandong has been cut off. Chiang's troops occupied Fan County on the 10th and Nanle on the 15th. The Eighth Route Army on this front recovered Fan County and Puyang County on the 11th respectively.

After crushing Chiang's elite troops attempting to invade Linyi, General Chen Yi's troops in southern Shandong advanced in multiple routes. On the 11th, they recovered Yixian County and Guoli Village, ten miles east of Zaozhuang, capturing alive more than 6,000 men including the 26th Division Commander Ma Liwu, and killing or wounding more than 2,000 others. Subsequently, on the 16th, they recovered Qizhuang Station, ten miles west of Zaozhuang, capturing another 3,000 men, and repelled Chiang's troops who were advancing north from Taierzhuang to Nanlu and other places. Warmonger Chen Cheng has now arrived in Xuzhou to personally command the war in southern Shandong, and his elite 11th Division has been transferred to the Taierzhuang area to continue the offensive.

The Northeast Democratic Allied Army launched a counter-"nibbling" self-defense war in the area north of Jilin. From the 7th to the 13th, they successively recovered important strongholds such as Huashulinzi northeast of Huadian, Qitamu northwest of Yongji, Shitun, and Handapo southeast of Laoye Ridge, and Fulongquan west of Nongan, capturing or killing nearly 5,000 Chiang's troops.

While the central battlefield is in fierce fighting, the anti-"mopping-up" guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in Suwan and Jidong has become even more developed and strengthened. The military and civilians in central Jiangsu have won successive victories in their anti-"mopping-up" operations. For example, 149 out of 160 towns and villages in the Haimen and Qidong areas, and 36 out of 39 ports are still in the hands of the people. From the 7th to the 12th, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army in eastern Hebei successively recovered more than 250 strongholds, large and small, including Matou Town and its surrounding areas, in the triangular area between the north of the Grand Canal and the Pingjin Highway and Beilu Ning. On the 11th, they once attacked Wuqing City. In the above battles, a total of more than 1,100 Chiang's troops, including Deputy Regiment Commander Li Guolun, were captured or killed.

### 冀鲁豫敌陷入被动  各地蒋军手脚忙乱

    冀鲁豫敌陷入被动
    各地蒋军手脚忙乱
    【新华社延安二十日电】一周综合战报（十二日至十八日）：这一周的战报，显示蒋介石在各战场上的进攻已经手忙脚乱漏洞百出。这就是蒋介石为什么重弹其“和平”老调的真实原因。
    冀鲁豫地区的蒋军，在两个战线上均陷于被动，刘伯承将军一部自收复钜野、嘉祥后，即南进至金乡、鱼台、单县地区，打击侵犯蒋军，收复失地。顾祝同为挽救败局，督令荷泽、定陶蒋伪军分两路东犯，但均遭覆没，米文和、刘汝珍、张岚峰等部损失万余人，城武县城亦于十六日重告光复。现守备荷泽、定陶、曹县等地之蒋军力量单薄。另侵入冀南豫北地区之蒋军第五军及八十五师等部，因其鲁西后路已被切断，不得不被迫依托豫东北为其后方，并逐步向后退缩。该地蒋军十日侵占范县，十五日侵占南乐。该线八路军十一日分别收复范县、濮县。
    鲁南陈毅将军所部于粉碎企图侵犯临沂之蒋军精锐后，即分路挺进，十一日收复峄县城及枣庄东十里之郭里集，生俘二十六师师长马励武以下六千余人，另毙伤其两千余人。继于十六日收复枣庄西十里之齐庄车站，又生俘三千余人，并击退由台儿庄北犯南罗等地之蒋军。好战分子陈诚现已到徐州亲自指挥鲁南战局，其精锐整十一师已调至台儿庄一带继续进攻。
    东北民主联军在吉林以北地区展开反蚕食自卫战，自七日至十三日间先后收复桦甸东北之桦树林子、永吉西北之其塔木、石屯及老爷岭东南之韩大坡、农安西之伏龙泉等重要据点，共俘毙蒋军近五千人。
    当此中心战场激战之际，苏皖及冀东敌后游击战更加发展壮大，苏中军民反“清剿”连获胜利，如海门、启东地区一六○个市镇中之一四九个及三十九条港中之三十六条至今均在人民手中。冀东八路军某部自七日至十二日在运河北、平津公路与北路宁的三角地带内相继收复码头镇及其附近大小据点二百五十余处，十一日曾一度攻入武清城。在以上战斗中，共俘毙蒋军副团长李国轮以下一千百余人。
