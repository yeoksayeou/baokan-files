    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 18th dispatch] Liu Daming, a major and deputy regimental commander from the Second Regiment of the First Brigade of the First Division of Hu Zongnan, has been in the Liberated Areas for several months. While studying diligently, they have also been participating in social activities, gaining a more concrete understanding of the Liberated Areas, the Eighth Route Army, and the Communist Party. They have felt warmth and joy and, last month, organized an amateur theater troupe. For their first performance, they chose the famous Yan'an play, "Driven to Join Liangshan." They chose to perform this play because they had seen it performed at a celebration for Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's birthday, which reminded them of their own history and the lives of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The play premiered on the 2nd at the Yangcheng Martyrs' Cemetery. Liu Daming himself played the lead role of "Lin Chong," and his singing and acting were excellent. Other roles, such as "Grand Commandant Gao," "Lu Zhishen," and "Lin Chong's Wife," all received enthusiastic applause from the audience, and the performance did not end until 1 a.m. Additionally, they performed sixteen Yangko dances to celebrate the approaching bright year of 1947. Furthermore, Song Guangying, a private first class from the Fifth Company, Third Battalion, 51st Regiment, 31st Brigade, and others, recognized the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan in harming the country and the people. They understood that only by following the Communist Party could they survive. Therefore, they created many poems and rhythmic verses, distributing them to their original units to persuade their brothers to quickly turn back and stand on the side of the people: (1) Chiang Soldiers' Perspective: Conscription is at its peak, gunshots ring out everywhere, Zhang's son leaves his mother, Li's wife sheds tears. (2) "Head": Being a soldier has three "heads": being at the front in battle, getting punched on weekdays, and getting leftover change when paid. (3) Shooting Too High: Shoot too high, get hit with a rifle butt; shoot too low, grenade hits your head. (4) What Kind of Soldier Are We? Old Chiang sits on the throne, and we fight for him. Officials get promoted, but we are still soldiers. Officials get rich, but what do we get? Earn a few thousand yuan, not enough to buy shoes and socks. Get scolded today, get beaten tomorrow. We sell our lives, and they enjoy the benefits. Others have run away, but we are still so foolish. Hurry up and run, see what he can do. (5) For What? Following Old Chiang to be a poor soldier, no benefit, only a bad name. Parents scold us for being unfilial, wives scold us for having no conscience, relatives say we are not righteous, and the people say we are stubborn soldiers. We will still be cursed after death. Tell me, what are we doing this for? Old Chiang has a wicked heart, following the Americans, deceiving the brothers to fight the Eighth Route Army, taking American guns, slaughtering our own people. Look at this, how cruel can it be? (6) Pay Raise and Promotion: Pay raise, pay raise, prices are soaring, family burden is even heavier. Think carefully, isn't it still "the wool comes from the sheep's back"? Promotion, promotion, all a trick. Life is hard to protect, what's the point of promotion? To tell you the truth, besides opposing the civil war, you will only die!

    太岳罢战蒋阎军
    公演《逼上梁山》
    【本报太岳十八日电】胡宗南第一师第一旅罢战军官二团少校团副刘大明等在解放区已有数月，一面紧张学习一面参加社会活动，更具体的认识了解放区、八路军、共产党，感到了温暖愉快，月前组织了一个业余剧团，首次排演选择了延安名剧《逼上梁山》。他们排演这个剧本，是因为在庆祝朱总司令寿辰的大会上看见演出过，当时曾使他们回忆到自己的历史和蒋管区人民的生活。现该剧已于二日在阳城烈士陵园公演。刘大明亲饰剧中主角“林冲”，唱作俱佳，其他角色如“高太尉、鲁智深、林冲妻”，均博得全场呼声不断，演至深夜一时始散场。此外又扮演十六队秧歌，庆贺接近光明的一九四七年。另有三十一旅五一团三营五连上等兵宋光英等认清了蒋介石与阎锡山祸国殃民的罪行，明白了只有跟共产党走才有活路，因此创作了不少诗歌、快板，散发到原部队去，劝自己弟兄快快回头，站到人民方面来：（一）蒋兵论。捉兵月正晌，枪声到处响，张家儿郎离亲娘，李家妻子泪两行。（二）“头”。当兵有三“头”，打仗在前头，平日挨拳头，发饷落零头。（三）枪打高了。枪打高了挨托子，枪打低了手榴弹碰脑壳子。（四）当的什么兵？老蒋坐天下，咱替人家打，当官又升官，咱还是兵，当官饱发财，咱能发个啥？赚上几千元，不够买鞋袜，今天挨顿骂，明天挨顿打，卖命是咱们，享福是人家，别人都跑啦，咱就这样傻，赶快跑他妈，看他啥办法。（五）为了甚。跟上老蒋当穷兵，没有利来落臭名，父母骂咱不孝顺，妻子骂咱没良心，亲戚说咱不归正，百姓说咱是顽军，死了还要落骂名，你说咱是为了甚。老蒋坏了心，跟上美国人，欺骗弟兄们，来打八路军，拿上美国枪，残杀自己人，你看这样事，能有多残忍。（六）加饷与升级。加饷，加饷，物价飞涨，家庭负担，更加难当，仔细思考，还不是“羊毛出在羊身上”。升级，升级，全是把戏，命都难保，升个狗屁，实话告你，除开了反对内战四，你只有死！
