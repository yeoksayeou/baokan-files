　　Learn from the Second Company of the Wenshang Brigade
　　Wan Li, Secretary of the Seventh Prefectural Committee of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region

　　Since the fall of Jining, the Second Company of the Wenshang Brigade has achieved remarkable results in carrying out the task of mobilizing the masses in the county's marginal areas. The troops have been politically elevated, and the relationship between the army and the people has become closer, making it a model company for cherishing the masses in the entire military sub-district. First, the leadership of the county and the brigade is good. The county party committee absorbed the troops to participate in mobilizing the masses and organizing forces. Comrade Li Jiajun, the deputy captain of the brigade, and Comrade Zhen Baode, the deputy political commissar, understood ideologically that leading the masses to emancipation is the sacred task of the people's armed forces, so they constantly provided the company with various support in doing mass work. Second, their methods of mobilization and education are good. Instead of using commands, they first encouraged everyone to pour out their grievances, and from the soldiers' personal experiences of feudal oppression and the memories of emancipation, they raised the soldiers' class consciousness, making them say, "The poor brothers in the new areas are the same as we were in the past, and we must also lead the masses to emancipation." In the discussion of "Who do we rely on to fight guerrilla warfare," the soldiers strengthened their mass concept and further strengthened and improved their determination to do mass work. Third, they used the method of timely praising models and established a merit-recording system, summarizing and praising them at any time, and launching a revolutionary competition to cherish the masses and lead the masses to emancipation. Fourth, under the leadership of Company Commander Bao, Instructor Shang, and Deputy Company Commander Zhang, the relationship between officers and soldiers in the Second Company is good. The main reason is their concern for the soldiers' problems, big and small. Not only did they promote local solutions to the soldiers' family problems, but they also provided timely care in their lives and explained and solved problems for the soldiers. Therefore, everyone is working actively under the unified will of serving the people. From this, it seems that the Second Company is a good example of the mass line in carrying out political work. The vast majority of our soldiers are from basic mass backgrounds. They support the various propositions of the Communist Party. As long as we can firmly believe in them, start from their own level, and enlighten their consciousness, all problems can be solved, and the method of relying on commands and coercion is incorrect. Secondly, it proves that the troops can very well abide by mass discipline and can participate in mass movements. The Second Company of the Wenshang Brigade, not only no longer despises the Farmers' Association, but on the contrary, through its own experience, respects the Association even more, and the relationship between the army and the people is as close as a family.

　　向汶上大队二连学习
    冀鲁豫七地委书记  万里
    汶上大队二连，自济宁失守后，在县的边缘区，执行发动群众的任务成绩卓著，部队在政治上提高了，军民的关系也更密切，成为全分区爱护群众的模范连队。第一、他们县及大队的领导是好的，县委在发动群众组织力量中，即吸收了部队参加。大队副李家俊同志及副政委甄宝德同志，从思想上了解到领导群众翻身是人民武装的神圣任务，因此不断给连队在作群众工作上以各种支持。第二、他们的动员教育方式是好的，不是用命令的方式，而是先启发大家诉苦，从战士亲身受过的封建压迫与翻身的回忆中，提高战士的阶级觉悟，使他们自己说出“新地区的穷苦兄弟也同咱们过去一样，咱们也得来领导群众翻身”。在“打游击战依靠谁”的讨论中，战士加强了群众观念，更加强和提高了作群众工作的决心。第三、他们运用了及时表扬模范的方法，建立了记功制度，随时总结表扬，发动了爱护群众、领导群众翻身的革命竞赛。第四、二连在鲍连长、尚指导员、张副连长领导之下，官兵关系是好的，主要的原因是他们对战士的大小问题的关心。不但推动地方解决战士的家庭问题，他们在生活上也能及时关心，多给战士解释与解决问题。故大家均在为人民服务的统一的意志下积极工作着。由此看来，二连是进行政治工作中群众路线的好榜样。我们的战士，绝大多数是基本群众出身，他们拥护共产党的各种主张，只要我们能坚决相信他们，从他们自己的水平出发，启发他们的自觉，是可以解决一切问题的，依靠命令强迫的作法是不正确的。其次，证明部队是能够很好遵守群众纪律，而且是可能参加群众运动的。汶上大队二连，不但不再轻视农民联合会，相反的在自己体验中，对联合会更加尊重了，军民关系亲如一家。
