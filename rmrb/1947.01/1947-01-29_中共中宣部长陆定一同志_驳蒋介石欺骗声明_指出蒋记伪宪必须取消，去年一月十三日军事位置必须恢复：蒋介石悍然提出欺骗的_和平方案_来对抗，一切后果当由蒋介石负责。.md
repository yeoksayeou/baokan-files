Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, today refuted the statement made by the Central Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang on the 20th as follows:

The entire content of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department's statement is to reject the two conditions of the Chinese Communist Party for resuming peace talks, namely, refusing to abolish Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-constitution and restore the military positions of January 13th last year, and putting forward the so-called four-point "peace plan." These four points were handed over to the Nanjing Office of the Chinese Communist Party by Chiang Kai-shek through the US side on the 23rd, so it is Chiang Kai-shek's proposal. Judging from Chiang Kai-shek's action itself, it can be seen that the so-called "peace talks" are completely deceptive, and the so-called four-point "peace plan" is used to reject the preconditions for genuine peace talks. Since he does not want genuine preconditions that can guarantee peace and realize democracy, what sincerity can be spoken of? What peace talks can be spoken of?

Minister Lu pointed out that the abolition of Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-constitution and the restoration of the military positions of January 13th last year are both necessary and completely achievable.

Since Chiang Kai-shek was able to use coercion and deception to bring 90% of his main force to attack the Liberated Areas, what reason does he have not to transfer these troops back to their original defense in the need for peace? The People's Liberation Army has captured more than 300,000 Chiang Kai-shek invading troops, from army commanders and division commanders to soldiers. Everyone says they are unwilling to fight a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek and are very willing to have peace and return to their original places. What reason does Chiang Kai-shek have to force them to be cannon fodder in the civil war? The so-called "over the years, the positions of each other have changed greatly," so the restoration of the military positions of January 13th last year is actually impossible, etc., isn't it clearly deceiving people?!

Another "reason" for the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department's statement to refuse to restore the military position on January 13th is that "if the government retreats from the areas it has recovered, the lives and property of the people in the area will have nothing to rely on," which is a complete lie! Chiang's army occupied more than 160 cities and more than 179,000 square kilometers of land in the Liberated Areas, where there are more than 20 million people in the Liberated Areas, equivalent to half the population of France. Before Chiang's army invaded, the farmers there had realized land to the tiller, democratic government had been established, traitors had been punished, and people from all walks of life lived and worked in peace and contentment, without disasters and economic crises. After Chiang's army invaded, the farmers' land was confiscated, fascist special agent terror replaced democratic politics, and after the traitors and bullies returned, they were given official positions by the Chiang government. Chiang's officials and generals burned, killed, raped, plundered, levied taxes and grain, and corruption ran rampant, and more than 20 million people were again subjected to the boundless suffering of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship. Chiang Kai-shek did indeed "protect" the traitors, special agents, bullies, and corrupt officials to their heart's content. When did he protect the lives and property of the people for a minute! It is precisely in order to protect the lives and property of the people that Chiang's army must withdraw from all occupied areas! In Chiang Kai-shek's "peace plan," the so-called "ceasefire in place" is proposed. Everyone should remember that there have been three ceasefires in place since the ceasefire order in January last year: the January ceasefire order was the first, the Northeast ceasefire agreement on March 17th was the second, and the on-site ceasefire negotiations in June were the third. Each time, the CCP made extreme concessions, but the result of the concessions was Chiang Kai-shek's three consecutive sabotages. Are the Chinese people really a bunch of Adou, and will they give Chiang Kai-shek a fourth ceasefire in place in the future, so that Chiang Kai-shek can make a fourth sabotage and facilitate him to wipe out all the Liberated Areas? Who can guarantee that he will not do this?! Now the Kuomintang's so-called "ceasefire in place" is a "ceasefire in place" after Chiang Kai-shek completely tore up the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and launched an unprecedented civil war. This is to ask the Chinese people to recognize the results he has created by force in violation of the agreement in bad faith, thereby encouraging warlords to realize the illusion of military unification,肆撕毁一切信义、大打内战. Chiang Kai-shek talks about "political solution" again and again, but his actual actions are "military solution." If the Chinese people agree to this, what hope is there for peace? If the Communist Party of China agrees to this, how will it explain to the people? For the sake of the domestic peace of the motherland and the welfare of the people of the motherland, the Communist Party of China must never recognize the results created by Chiang Kai-shek's illegal use of force. Therefore, we absolutely cannot agree to the so-called "in place" "ceasefire" which is actually an attempt to eliminate all the Liberated Areas. The military position on January 13th must be fully restored! The 90% of Chiang's army illegally transferred by Chiang Kai-shek must be returned to their original station one by one! Peace cannot be guaranteed without this!

As for the third and fourth points in Chiang Kai-shek's "peace plan," such as reorganizing the army, restoring transportation, and local government, etc., I don't know how many times they have been mentioned and how many times they have been discussed before; however, either there is no result, or the result is that Chiang Kai-shek tore it up. Before Chiang Kai-shek abolishes the pseudo-constitution and restores the military position of January 13th last year, these issues cannot be discussed at all. Therefore, the so-called "the government is willing to send personnel to discuss or even hold a round table meeting" in the first article of Chiang Kai-shek's "plan" is not necessary before the two conditions of the Chinese Communist Party are realized. Chiang Kai-shek put forward these topics as a "plan" for the purpose of perfunctory to deceive people!

Minister Lu Dingyi pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-constitution must also be abolished and can be abolished. Since the Republic of China, this is the third pseudo-constitution. Since Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun's two pseudo-constitutions have been abolished, why can't Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-constitution be abolished? Since Chiang Kai-shek violated the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in bad faith and unilaterally convened the "National Assembly" and passed the pseudo-constitution, the people have reason to order him to abolish this pseudo-constitution!

The Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department's statement said that "the Chinese Communist Party has no reason to oppose" this Chiang's pseudo-constitution, so may I ask what reason Chiang Kai-shek has to create this pseudo-constitution? May I ask whether the Chinese people had any reason to oppose Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun's pseudo-constitutions in the past? Since Chiang Kai-shek created this pseudo-constitution, if he does not abolish it, he is admitting fascist dictatorship, admitting military閥毁法乱纪, and what else can be said about political democratization and army nationalization! Therefore, the pseudo-constitution must be abolished!

The "National Assembly" convened by Chiang Kai-shek without authorization has been unanimously cursed by most public opinion at home and abroad. The Communist Party of China and democratic people from all walks of life have long advised Chiang Kai-shek not to hold any one-party illegal split "National Assembly," but Chiang Kai-shek insisted on not listening; after Chiang's "National Assembly" opened, we advised him to dissolve it, but he did not listen. Chiang Kai-shek is so unscrupulous, the Chinese people will never allow it! The Chinese people and genuine democrats absolutely do not recognize this illegal split "National Assembly" as valid!

As for the representatives of Chiang's "National Assembly," most of them were designated, circled, bribed, and rigged out ten years ago, and some were temporarily "supplemented" by Chiang Kai-shek and his helpers. There are even traitors in it, which is even uglier than the piglet members of Cao Kun's time; where are they "representatives of all ethnic groups, provinces, cities, and occupations in the country"? When was Chiang Kai-shek's draft pseudo-constitution finally reviewed by the Political Consultative Conference? Where do the main principles in it, such as people's rights, autonomy of ethnic minorities, the relationship between legislation and administration, and local equalization of power, conform to the "principles of the Political Consultative Conference Agreement"? Chiang Kai-shek's refusal to abolish such an ugly fascist pseudo-constitution is "obstinately sticking to his own views," harming the country, betraying the people, betraying the nation, and determined to be reactionary to the end!

Minister Lu also pointed out that the abolition of the pseudo-constitution and the restoration of the military positions of January 13th last year are the minimum preconditions for peace talks. This is the minimum condition because Chiang Kai-shek has cleanly torn up the four promises, the ceasefire agreement, the troop reorganization plan, the Northeast ceasefire agreement, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, assassinated democratic people such as Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, convened the illegal "National Assembly," signed the treasonous "Sino-US Commercial Treaty," launched a nationwide war, and occupied so many Liberated Areas. Chiang Kai-shek has done so many lawless things, and of course, several preconditions must be implemented for further peace talks. Otherwise, who can believe that he has the slightest sincerity?! According to the rule of law, all the warmongers of the Kuomintang should be punished as war criminals, the Kuomintang reactionaries and special agents who sabotaged the Political Consultative Conference should be punished as fascists, and the responsible personnel of the Kuomintang government who signed the "Sino-US Commercial Treaty" should be punished as traitors. And compensate the people of the whole country and the people of the Liberated Areas for the huge losses caused by Chiang Kai-shek's launch of the civil war. We have not yet raised these fair and reasonable demands. We only put forward two points: abolishing the pseudo-constitution and restoring the military position of January 13th last year. Isn't it extremely lenient to Chiang Kai-shek? To what extent has Chiang Kai-shek been lawless in the past year! If he does not even implement the minimum two points we have put forward, and all the past sins are not counted, "ceasefire in place" will allow him to have time to recuperate, consolidate the occupied areas, replenish troops, and "reorganize the government" to obtain 500 million or more loans and military assistance from the US government, and have the strength to launch a large-scale attack again, then Chiang Kai-shek will definitely be more lawless. The lesson is not far away, it was just last year. Therefore, we don't want national independence, domestic peace, and democratic freedom, then it is over. If we still want independence, peace, and democracy, then Chiang Kai-shek must realize the two points of abolishing the pseudo-constitution and restoring the military position of January 13th last year. We must not stop until we achieve our goal. All deception is useless. Now, since Chiang Kai-shek has rejected these two points and brazenly put forward a deceptive "peace plan" to confront us, Chiang Kai-shek should be responsible for all consequences.

    驳蒋介石欺骗声明
    指出蒋记伪宪必须取消，去年一月十三日军事位置必须恢复：蒋介石悍然提出欺骗的“和平方案”来对抗，一切后果当由蒋介石负责。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】中共中央宣传部部长陆定一今日就二十日国民党中央宣传部之声明加以驳斥如下：
    国民党中宣部声明的全部内容，是拒绝中共恢复和谈的两个条件，即拒绝取消蒋介石伪宪与恢复去年一月十三日军事位置，而提出所谓“和平方案”四条。这四条已于二十三日由蒋介石经美方转交南京中共办事处，所以是蒋介石的提案。就蒋介石这一行动本身来看，就可以知道所谓“和谈”完全是欺骗，所谓“和平方案”四条，是用来拒绝真正和谈的先决条件的。既然他不要真正可以保障和平、实现民主的先决条件，又有什么诚意可言？又有什么和谈可言？
    陆部长指出：取消蒋介石伪宪和恢复去年一月十三日军事位置，是必须做到与完全做得到的。
    蒋介石既然能够以强迫和欺骗种种方法把他的主力百分之九十厘来进攻解放区，有何理由不能在和平的需要之下把这些军队调回原防？人民解放军俘获的蒋介石进犯军已达三十余万人，上自军长师长，下至士兵，人人都说不愿替蒋介石打内战，都极愿和平，回到原地去；蒋介石有何理由硬要把他们放在内战中当炮灰？所谓“越时经年，彼此位置变动甚大”，因而恢复去年一月十三日军事位置实际上办不到等等，岂不是明明白白骗人么？！
    国民党中宣部声明中拒绝恢复一月十三日军事位置的另一“理由”，是“政府已经收复之地区，如一经撤退，则该区人民之生命财产即无所依托”，这是十足的谎话！蒋军占领了解放区一百六十余城市、十七万九千多平方公里土地，那里有二千余万解放区人民，等于半个法国的人口。在蒋军侵占以前，那里的农民已实现耕者有其田，民主政府已建立，汉奸已惩办，各阶层人民已安居乐业，没有灾荒，没有经济危机。蒋军侵占之后，农民的土地被没收，法西斯的特务恐怖代替了民主政治，汉奸恶霸回来后由蒋政府封官进爵，蒋官将军烧杀奸淫、横征暴敛、抽丁派粮、贪污横行，二千余万人民重新受到蒋介石独裁的无边苦难。蒋介石的确尽情的“保护”了汉奸特务恶霸赃官，那里有一分钟保护过人民的生命财产！正是为了保护人民的生命财产，蒋军非由全部侵占区退出不可！在蒋介石的“和平方案”中提出所谓“现地停战”，大家应记得现地停战从去年一月停战令以来已有三次：一月停战令是第一次，三月十七日东北停战协定是第二次，六月现地休战谈判是第三次，每次都是中共方面极度让步，但让步的结果，是蒋介石一连三次的破坏。难道中国人民真是一群阿斗，以后还要给蒋介石来一个第四次现地停战，以便蒋介石再作第四次的破坏，便于他将所有解放区消灭干净么？谁又能够担保他不这样做？！现在国民党的所谓“现地停战”，乃是在蒋介石全部撕毁停战令与政协决议、放手发动空前内战之后的“现地停战”，这就是要中国人民承认他背信弃义地违反协议以武力造成的结果，从而鼓励军阀实行武力统一的迷梦，放肆撕毁一切信义、大打内战，蒋介石口口声声“政治解决”，但他实际行动却是“军事解决”。中国人民如果同意这点以后，还有什么和平希望呢？中国共产党如果同意了这点，它又怎样向人民交代？中国共产党为了祖国的国内和平，为了祖国人民的福利，决不能够承认蒋介石如此违法以武力造成的结果。因此，绝对不能同意所谓“现地”而实际上是企图消灭全部解放区的“停战”，一月十三日军事位置非完全恢复不可！蒋介石违法调动的百分之九十的蒋军非一个一个退返原来驻地不可！不如此和平绝无保障！
    至于蒋介石“和平方案”中第三第四条如整编军队恢复交通地方政权等等，以前不知提过多少回，谈过多少次；但是，或则毫无结果，或则有了结果也是蒋介石撕毁。在蒋介石取消伪宪和恢复去年一月十三日军事位置以前，这些问题根本谈不上。因此蒋介石“方案”中第一条所谓“政府愿意派员商谈以至举行圆桌会议”等，在中共两项条件未得实现前，并无必要。蒋介石提出这些题目作为“方案”，其目的仅在空洞搪塞，以便骗人而已！
    陆定一部长指出：蒋介石的伪宪也是必须取消和可以取消的。自民国以来，这是第三个伪宪了。既然袁世凯和曹锟的两个伪宪都取消过，为什么蒋介石的伪宪就取消不得？蒋介石既然背信弃义地违反政协决议、单方面召集“国大”，通过伪宪，人民就有理由命令他取消这个伪宪！
    国民党中宣部声明说什么这个蒋记伪宪“中共实无理由加以反对”，那么试问蒋介石又有何理由制造出这个伪宪来呢？试问中国人民从前反对过袁世凯和曹锟的伪宪又有没有理由呢？蒋介石既然制造了这个伪宪，不把它取消掉，就是承认法西斯独裁，承认军阀毁法乱纪，还有什么政治民主化、军队国家化之可言！所以伪宪非取消不可！
    蒋介石擅自召开的“国大”，不论中外，绝大多数舆论都一致咒骂。中共和各方民主人士老早就忠告蒋介石，不要开什么一党非法的分裂的“国大”，蒋介石偏偏不听；蒋记“国大”开幕之后，我们又忠告他叫他解散，他又不听。蒋介石这样横行无忌，中国人民绝对不能容许！中国人民及真正民主人士绝对不承认这个非法的分裂的“国大”为有效的！
    至于蒋记“国大”的代表，大部分是十年前由指定圈定贿选舞弊弄出来的，一部分是蒋介石及其帮闲们临时“增补”的，里面还有汉奸，比曹锟时候的猪仔议员还要丑；那里是什么“全国各民族各省市各职业代表”？蒋介石的伪宪法草案几时由政治协商会议最后审查过？其中的主要原则问题，如人民权利、少数民族自治、立法与行政的关系、地方均权等，那里符合于“政协协议原则”？蒋介石不肯取消这样丑恶的法西斯的伪宪，才是“固执己见”，贻害全国，背叛人民，背叛民族，决心反动到底呢！
    陆部长又指出：取消伪宪和恢复去年一月十三日军事位置，乃是最低限度的和谈先决条件。这所以是最低限度的条件，因为蒋介石已经干净撕毁了四项诺言、停战协定、整军方案、东北停战协定和政治协商会议决议，暗杀了李公朴、闻一多等民主人士，召集了非法“国大”，订立了卖国的“中美商约”，发动全国大打，侵占了那样多的解放区。蒋介石干了这样许多无法无天的事情，再要和谈当然不能不实行几个先决条件。否则，谁能相信他有丝毫诚意！？照法理来说，应当把国民党的一切好战分子当作战犯惩办，把破坏政协的国民党反动分子和特务分子当作法西斯惩办，把签订“中美商约”的国民党政府负责人员当作卖国贼惩办。并赔偿全国人民与解放区人民因蒋介石发动内战而受到的浩大损失。这些公平合理的要求，我们都还没有提出。仅仅提了取消伪宪和恢复去年一月十三日军事位置两条。对于蒋介石岂不是宽大到了极点么？一年以来，蒋介石无法无天已经到了什么程度！如果连我们所提最低限度的两条都不要他实行，把过去的罪恶一概不算，“现地停战”下来，让他得到休整时间，巩固侵占地区，补充军队，“改组政府”取得美国政府五万万或更多的借款和军火援助，有了再来大举进攻的力量，那时蒋介石还必定要更加无法无天。殷鉴不远，就在去年。所以，我们不要民族独立国内和平与民主自由则已，如果还要独立和平民主，则一定要蒋介石实现取消伪宪与恢复去年一月十三日军事位置两条，不达目的决不能休止，一切欺骗都是无用的。现在，蒋介石既然拒绝这两条，悍然提出欺骗的“和平方案”来对抗，则一切后果当然由蒋介石负责。
