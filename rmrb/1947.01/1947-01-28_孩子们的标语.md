    Children's Slogans
    Wang Nan
    Pushing aside piles and piles of documents,
    I stroll idly where the children play,
    The sun on the west side of the village warms my face, my hands.
    A red-painted wall (burned down by the Japanese five years ago),
    Like the footprints of a snail in spring,
    Has words written on it by children in chalk.
    The structure of the characters is so naive,
    Like their age;
    Every horizontal and vertical stroke is unsteady,
    Like a child's fidgety eyebrows and nose.
    Among the old slogans of
    "Down with Japanese Imperialism,"
    I discover a new one.
    It must have been written by the children just before going home for dinner,
    The chalk characters appear dazzlingly fresh in the sunlight.
    Appreciating this solemn work of the children,
    Laughter flies from my heart to my lips,
    They have written this:
    "Chiang Kai-shek, we will certainly crush you!"
    The person whose name is written as "Chiang Kai-shek" by the children,
    You have no reason to resent such children:
    Before your eyes, although there are still the most shameless Chinese,
    Who regard being your accomplice as an honor (!),
    Tomorrow, even your own children's children,
    Will refuse to acknowledge you as their ancestor!
    In the history classroom of the primary school,
    They will pound the table with their little fists, angrily cursing
    You, this "Chiang Kai-shek,"
    Like the descendants of Shi Jingtang (the puppet emperor) hate Shi Jingtang,
    The descendants of Liu Yu hate Liu Yu,
    The descendants of Qin Hui hate Qin Hui.
    (Ah, since ancient times, has there ever been anyone who admits to being a descendant of your kind!)

    孩子们的标语
    王南
    推开一堆一堆文件，
    我在孩子们玩耍的地方闲走，
    村西边的太阳照热我的脸，我的手。
    一扇刷红的墙（五年前给日本人烧垮的），
    像春天蜗牛走过的脚印样，
    有孩子们用粉笔写上去的字。
    字架子那样幼稚，
    像他们的年纪；
    每一横每一竖都写不稳，
    像小孩好动的小眉毛小鼻子。
    在横三竖四的
    “打倒日本帝国主义”的旧标语当中，
    我发现一条新的。
    是孩子们回家吃饭以前刚写上的吧，
    粉笔字在太阳光里显得耀眼的新鲜。
    鉴赏小孩们这个庄严的工作，
    笑，从心里飞上我的嘴边，
    他们这样写着：
    “蒋介石，我们一定粉碎你！”
    姓名给小孩写成“蒋介石”的那个人啊，
    你没有丝毫理由恼恨这样的孩子：
    眼前，虽然还有最无耻的中国人，
    把给你帮凶当作光荣（！），
    明天，就是你自己孩子的孩子，
    都要不承认你是他们祖先了！
    在小学校的历史课堂上，
    他们要用小拳头敲打着桌子，怒骂
    你这个“蒋介石”，
    像石敬塘（儿皇帝）的子孙恨石敬塘，
    刘豫的子孙恨刘豫，
    秦桧的子孙恨秦桧。
    （啊，从古以来，那有一个人承认过自己是你们这一流人的后代！）
