　　Peasant Creativity
　　Jincheng Fills in Gaps and Rounds Out Holdings
　　“Gaining Land Gains the Emperor”
　　After the widespread unfolding of the filling-in-gaps and rounding-out-holdings movement in Jincheng County, even the peasants who were previously said to have no grievances or opinions began to speak up. Xiao Suo, a hired laborer from Fucheng, righteously demanded land from the farmers' association chairman: "Chairman, my suffering is great! Give me land! I've been a hired laborer in Shuicun for thirty years, since I was fourteen, fetching chamber pots for the landlord, wearing socks without soles in winter, and I'm still a pauper. Tell me, shouldn't this deep pit be filled?" In Fucheng, there are still twelve such hired laborers who have not yet turned over, and in Dongtou Village, there are still six. They are now re-suing for their grievances to carry out filling-in. The masses in Miaojiang Village said: "After winning the world, the peasants get land, which is 'gaining the emperor'. With land, the common people will sit firmly in the world." The peasants in Liujiawan said: "The land was originally ours, and today it returns to the hands of its masters." Demanding land has become a common demand among landless and land-poor peasants.
　　“Struggling Against Thought”
　　The peasants said to the landlords and local bullies: "Even a starving camel is bigger than a sheep. The feudal tail is very long and must be cut off." After a night of grievances in Baocun, they cut off the tails of twelve landlords and local bullies in one breath the next day. After investigation in Shandicun, it was found that three unthoroughly struggled traitors and bullies had infiltrated the farmers' association. The peasants held a mass meeting to expel them and re-liquidate. After Zhoucun finished cutting off the tails of the landlords and local bullies, they discovered that these people often harbored hatred for the masses. Therefore, the entire village created a method of "struggling against thought," giving the landlords and local bullies being struggled with a brain-opening session in the meeting: "According to your past sins, should you be struggled against? What good will it do you to hope for the Central Army to come?" The masses did not beat or scold them, but kept asking questions, so that they could understand the principles. The mutual aid team leader said: "You don't have to be pessimistic. From now on, as long as you work hard, we can help you build a new family." Finally, everyone unanimously pointed out a broad road for them: there is only one way to go, and that is to follow the peasants. Engage in labor and production; there is no second way to go. After a period of ideological education, the landlords and local bullies not only reflected on themselves and confessed, willing to follow the masses in engaging in production, but also mobilized their families to participate in mutual aid groups.
　　Clearing the Bottom
　　Farmers' associations in various villages universally retained a portion of the fruits of struggle. In the past, although it was said that it had been cleared up on the surface, it was still hidden in various corners under various pretexts. After this liquidation, the amount was surprisingly large. Nanyinzhai, a village of 125 households, cleared out 60 shi of grain, 78 mu of land, 3 head of livestock, and other miscellaneous items worth 1.2 million, which were redistributed after being proposed by the masses. In addition, the masses in various villages have elected a fruit-clearing committee to help the farmers' association cadres clear up the old deposits, in order to strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses. Their slogan is: "Cut off the tail and clear the bottom, so that the peasants can fill in the pits."
　　Three Lists Announced
　　Whether the thorough check of emancipation is thorough or not depends on the self-reporting and evaluation of the peasants. Cujing Village issued a list announcing the results of the group meeting evaluation of land and the number of fruits of struggle obtained from self-reporting. The first list is the investigation list, that is, the population, land, houses, etc. of each household. The second list is the clearing list, announcing the fruits obtained from cutting off the tail and the number of old deposits cleared. The third list is the distribution list, announcing the location and boundaries of the land obtained by each household after filling in the gaps. If everyone has no objections, the old deeds will be burned and new deeds will be established to handle the handover. The village held a grand "emancipation and land protection" celebration on New Year's Day and prepared for the large-scale production movement next year.

　　农民的创造
    晋城填平补齐零记
  　“得地得帝”
    晋城全县普遍展开填平补齐运动后，一向所谓无苦或无意见的农民都开口了。府城雇工小锁理直气壮的向农会主席要地：“主席我的苦可大哩，给我分地吧！我在水村当了三十年雇工，从十四岁起就给地主提尿盆，冬天穿着没底袜，直到现在还是一个穷光汉，你说这个深坑应填不应填？”府城像这样未翻身的雇工，尚有十二个，董头村尚有六个，他们现在正在重新诉苦进行填补。苗匠村群众说：“打下天下，农民得地，就是‘得帝’，有了地，老百姓就坐稳了天下。”刘家川的农民说：“地原来就是咱们的，今天才归回主人手里。”要地已成为无地少地农民的普遍要求了。
  　“斗思想”
    农民们向地主恶霸说：“饿死的骆驼也比羊胖，封建的尾巴可长着哩，非割不行。”保村经一夜的诉苦，第二天一口气便割掉了十二家地主与恶霸的尾巴，山底村经查检发现有三个斗争未彻底的奸霸混入农会，农民们召开大会开除他们，重新清算。周村在割完地主恶霸尾巴之后，发现这些人经常仇视群众，于是全村群众，创造了一个“斗思想”的方法，在会议上给被斗地主恶霸开开脑筋：“依你过去的罪恶该不该斗争？你盼望中央军来对你有啥好处？”群众并不打骂他们，一直追问下去，使其想通道理。互助队长说：“你们不必悲观，从今以后只要下力劳动，我们可以帮助你们建立新家庭。”最后大家一致给他们指出一条大路，只有跟着农民走。下劳力闹生产，再没有第二条路可走。经过一番思想教育，地主恶霸们不仅自己反省坦白，愿跟着群众一齐闹生产，并动员家人参加互助组。
　  清底子
    各村农会普遍存留一部分斗争果实，过去表面上虽说分清了，但在各种借口下还隐藏在各个角落里，这次清算后其数目之大甚为惊人，南尹寨一百廿五户的村子即清出粮食六十石，地七十八亩，牲口三条，及其他价值一百廿万的杂物，经群众提出重新分了。此外各村群众都选出了果实清底委员会，帮助农会干部清理旧存，借以密切干部与群众关系，他们的口号是：“割完尾巴清了底，好给农民填坑坑”。
  　三榜公布
    翻身大检查彻底与否，要看农民自报与评议。俘井村出榜公布小组大会评议土地的结果，与自报所得斗争果实的数字，第一榜是调查榜，即每户人口、土地、房屋等，第二榜是清理榜、公布割尾巴所得果实，清理旧存果实数目，第三榜是分配榜，公布填补后各户所得土地的座落四至。如果大家没有意见，即焚毁旧契另立新契办理交代，其村于阳历元旦日举行全村“翻身保地”大庆祝，并准备明年大生产运动。
