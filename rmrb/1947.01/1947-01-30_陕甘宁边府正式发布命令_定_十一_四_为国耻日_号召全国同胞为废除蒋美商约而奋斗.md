    Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government Officially Issues Order
    Designating "November 4th" as National Humiliation Day
    Calling on All Compatriots to Strive to Abolish the Chiang-American Treaty
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, because Chiang Kai-shek and the United States signed the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in Nanjing on November 4th of last year, selling out all of China's territorial sovereignty and the survival rights of the Chinese nation, with a scope and harshness of conditions far exceeding the Twenty-One Demands signed by Yuan Shikai and the Japanese invaders, hereby orders: (1) To accept the suggestion of the Yan'an All-Circles Support National Student Patriotic Movement and Political Consultative Conference Anniversary Commemoration Conference on January 10th to designate November 4th as National Humiliation Memorial Day. All levels of government, all brigade and regiment headquarters, all institutions, and schools shall fly flags at half-mast for one day every year on November 4th and hold meetings to commemorate the national humiliation until the treaty is abolished. (2) To repeatedly publicize to the masses, expose the content and crimes of the traitorous treaty signed by the Chiang government, and vow not to recognize this treaty. (3) To call on all people in the border region, all liberated areas, and all compatriots throughout the country to fight together to completely abolish this traitorous treaty and wash away the new national humiliation, and never give up until the goal is achieved.

    陕甘宁边府正式发布命令
    定“十一·四”为国耻日
    号召全国同胞为废除蒋美商约而奋斗
    【新华社延安二十八日电】陕甘宁边区政府为蒋介石和美国于去年十一月四日在南京签订的中美通商航海条约出卖了全中国领土主权和中华民族的生存权利，其范围之广条件之苛远超过袁世凯与日寇签订的二十一条，为此命令：（一）接受一月十日延安各界声援全国学生爱国运动与政协周年纪念大会建议规定十一月四日为国耻纪念日，各级政府、各旅团司令部、各机关、学校以后每年十一月四日悬半旗一天，并举行集会纪念国耻，直至该约废除为止。（二）向群众反复宣传揭露蒋政府所订卖国条约的内容及其罪恶，誓死不承认这一条约。（三）号召全边区人民与各解放区及全国同胞共同奋斗，为彻底废除这一卖国条约与洗雪新国耻而奋斗，不达目的绝不罢休。
