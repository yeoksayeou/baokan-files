　　Soviet Engineers Complete Huge Project
    Dnieper Hydroelectric Station Begins to Turn
    Sixteen Underwater Tunnels Lead to Sluice Gates
    [This newspaper report] (TASS, Moscow, 18th) The first turbine of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station named after Lenin, which is being repaired, made its first turn on January 17th. Before the war, this power station supplied power to the entire Dnieper industrial area and many factories in the Donets Basin. During its operation from 1932 to the summer of 1941, the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station saved the country 15 million tons of coal. In the restoration of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, which was destroyed by the war, the builders made improvements in accordance with the latest scientific achievements. After increasing the water pressure and installing modern equipment, the energy of this hydroelectric station will be increased. The builders completed a huge amount of work, clearing 16,000 tons of destroyed reinforced concrete during construction. For the first time in the world, Soviet engineers solved the most complex hydraulic engineering problems, leading sixteen underwater tunnels to the sluice gates under terrible water pressure. Yesterday, the water level of the Dnieper River reached 38 meters above sea level, rushing into the spiral steel pipes and causing the rotor of the first turbine to turn.

　　苏工程师完成巨大工程
    第聂伯水电站开始转动
    十六条河底地道引到水闸
    【本报讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日电：正在修复中的以列宁为名的第聂伯水电站，其第一部涡旋水车已于一月十七日作了第一次的转动。战前此动力站供给整个第聂伯区工业及顿尼次盆地许多工厂的动力，从一九三二到一九四一年夏季的工作过程中，第聂伯水电站为国家节省了一千五百万吨煤，在被战争破坏的第聂伯水电站之修复过程中，建造者依照最近的科学成就作了改进。经过水压的增加及现代化设备的装置，此水力站能量将要提高，建筑者完成了巨大的工作，在建造中清除了一万六千吨破毁的钢骨水泥，在世界上苏联工程师第一次解决了最复杂的水力技术问题，在可怕的水压之下，引十六条河底地道至水闸。昨日第聂伯河水位高达海平面以上三十八公尺，冲进了旋形钢管，使第一部涡旋水车的回旋机转动了。
