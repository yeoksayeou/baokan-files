Comrade Ye Jianying and others
    Send a telegram to comfort our soldiers in the entire region
  　Earnestly hoping to continue their efforts and crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive.
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] Comrade Ye Jianying and all comrades of the Chinese Communist Party delegation to the Peiping Military Mediation Department sent a telegram to the leaders of the military region on New Year's Day to express their condolences to the soldiers in the entire region. The original text is as follows: Comrades Bo Cheng, Dai Yuanhong, Kun Xiaoping, Yibo, Jichun, and Lida, and to all comrades of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army:
    As the victorious New Year's Day of 1947 approaches, we would like to extend our warm greetings to you comrades who are fighting heroically to defend the independence, peace, and democracy of the Chinese nation, and wish you good health in the New Year.
    Since Chiang Kai-shek, supported by the American imperialists, unilaterally tore up the Four Agreements and launched a full-scale civil war last July, half a year has passed. In the past six months, in order to defend the liberated areas and the independence, peace, and democracy of the Chinese people, you have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, crushed Chiang Kai-shek's many frenzied offensives, and resolutely, decisively, and thoroughly eliminated eighteen brigades of the Chiang army. This is truly a supreme contribution to the country and the nation, and it is your greatest glory.
    But now Chiang Kai-shek is unwilling to accept the failure of the past six months, and still stubbornly continues his traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policy. Therefore, the eyes of the people of the whole country are eagerly watching you, and the hopes of the Chinese people are pinned on you. They know deeply that only your victory is the blessing of the Chinese people. Therefore, everyone eagerly hopes that you will continue your efforts and eliminate the second eighteen brigades, the third eighteen brigades... of the Chiang army in the next six months to completely crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, recover lost ground, and welcome the arrival of an independent, peaceful, and democratic new China.
    Ye Jianying and all comrades of the Chinese Communist Party delegation to the Peiping Military Mediation Department
　　　      New Year's Day, 1947, in Peiping

　　叶剑英同志等
    电慰我全区将士
  　热切期望再接再厉，粉碎蒋介石进攻。
    【本报特讯】叶剑英同志暨北平军调部中共代表团全体同志于元旦日致电军区首长慰问全区将士，原文如下：伯承代远宏坤小平一波际春李达诸同志并转晋冀鲁豫人民解放军全体同志：
    当此胜利的一九四七年元旦来临之际，我们谨向你们为保卫中华民族独立和平民主而浴血自卫的同志遥致热烈的慰问，并祝新年健康。
    自从去年七月蒋介石在美帝国主义者支持下，一手撕毁了四大协议，发动全面内战以来，已经有半年了。在这半年的过程中，你们为了保卫解放区，保卫全中国人民的独立和平与民主，坚决执行毛主席指示，粉碎了蒋介石许多次疯狂的进攻，坚决干脆彻底地消灭了蒋军十八个旅，这真是对国家民族的无上贡献，也是你们最大的光荣。
    但现在蒋介石不愿这半年的失败，还依旧一意孤行继续其卖国独裁内战方针，因此全国人民的眼睛都热望着你们，全中国人民的希望也都寄托在你们的身上，他们深知：只有你们的胜利，才是中国人民之福，因此大家都热切地期望着你们再接再厉，在今后半年内再消灭蒋军第二个十八个旅，第三个十八个旅……以彻底粉碎蒋介石的进攻，收复失地，来迎接独立和平民主新中国的到来。
    叶剑英暨北平军调部中共代表团全体同志启
