　　Central Bureau and Military Region Send Telegram Congratulating on the Great Victory at Yutai

　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Upon hearing of the victory at Yutai, the Central Bureau and Military Region sent a telegram to congratulate the frontline soldiers. The original telegram is as follows:

Comrades of all commanders and fighters on the front line of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region:

　　As the military and civilians in our rear enthusiastically commemorate the anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and the ceasefire order, we are extremely encouraged to hear of the victory at Yutai. This victory is the bugle call for our district to annihilate the second group of sixteen brigades, and it once again proves the strength of our ever-victorious people's army. It is a powerful support for the burgeoning patriotic student movement in Peiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai. We send our congratulations and extend our regards!
