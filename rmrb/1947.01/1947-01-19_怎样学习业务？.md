　　How to Learn Business?
    Hu Qiqian
    Why haven't all cadres fully implemented the principle of "learn what you do"? For example, in production and construction, all cadres participated and learned simultaneously, so the slogan of "learn what you do" was implemented. However, production and construction are not the business of all cadres. Various departments and agencies have their own unique business, and the slogan "learn what you do" has not been fully implemented in these areas. There are approximately three reasons for this: (1) Cadres are not settled in their work. Some say their interests don't align; they are doing administrative work but aspire to literature or other fields. If they are not interested in their work and are not settled, it is even more impossible to devote themselves to mastering their business. Others see that the grass is always greener on the other side. They always believe that their job position is unimportant, while others' are important, or that their job has no future, while others' do (the word "future" sometimes refers to status). It is good for cadres to seek a future from the perspective of seeking work progress, but it is wrong to look at which job gets promoted faster and which gets promoted slower. This easily creates a concept of status and the ideology of individual heroism. There is also a wrong view of seeing the current job and workplace as a hostel, staying for a few days and then leaving. Therefore, they have no intention of doing a good job in their current position, learning some skills to serve the masses, and wanting to leave before their buttocks are even warm. Naturally, it is even more impossible to master their business. (2) The influence of the "one-size-fits-all" work method. The border region is located in a rural environment with vast land and sparse population. The number of district and township cadres is small, and some have low levels of education. It would be even more difficult to carry out work solely relying on the work system. For some time-sensitive work, it is impossible to complete the task on schedule without mobilizing various cadres to carry out the work. As a result, the work of various departments themselves is often squeezed out, affecting the study of their own business. On the other hand, the lack of separation between Party and government work greatly affects business research. Some blur their own business and cannot find their own business, so they cannot talk about mastering their business. (3) Insufficient attention from leaders. Leaders' work is very busy, but they can still frequently lead the education on mastering business in cadre education. The central government's decision is for all cadres to implement: "Cadres in any work department must learn and master their own business." It can be seen that mastering business is the responsibility of each cadre, but the standards of cadres are inconsistent. If some cadres do not have leadership guidance on their own business, they either cannot delve into it or it takes too much time to delve into it, which affects the work. As for unsettled cadres, they still need frequent and specific ideological education. Therefore, the decision also states: "Leading organs and their responsible persons must guide their subordinate cadres to carry out learning in an orderly manner."
    So, how to learn business? Learning business is a matter of bitterness before sweetness. When you want to do your job well but don't know how, it is very painful. When you find some clues, you feel that your thinking is sharper, you can see some problems, you can explain some problems, and you make fewer mistakes when dealing with some problems, and you feel very happy spiritually. How exactly do you learn business? In fact, the central government has already clearly stipulated the content, which includes five aspects: studying the situation, studying policies, laws, instructions, and decisions, studying experience, studying historical knowledge, and studying the relevant theoretical knowledge of your own work. Due to my own lack of experience, my understanding of the instructions from higher levels is very poor. For example, the Northwest Bureau's instructions on the reconstruction of rural branches last year were initially seen as general concepts, but mistakes were made during implementation. Later, while doing it, I studied it and realized the correctness and true content of each paragraph and how to implement that instruction. This shows that I have no new ideas on learning business, but I only understand this problem now.
    To learn business, first, you must put down your baggage and establish a business mindset. Some baggage is obviously wrong, such as not being interested, not wanting to delve into the current business, and personal plans. In fact, for example, a love of literature does not hinder other work. If you have time for literary activities, you can collect materials in your life at any time, and it is not too late to do it when you have considerable self-cultivation; if you only have a love for it and set your sights too early, I am afraid it is not a good policy. Interest is gradually cultivated and also changes. Using interest to determine the standard for delving into business is unfavorable to both work and oneself. For comrades who do not have a business mindset, long-term education should be carried out.
    Second, is independent and painstaking research and humbly learning from others. Some work principles, experiences, and theories must be painstakingly studied to understand their mysteries. Before you understand it yourself, the best principles and experiences are other people's. Sometimes it is difficult to understand without taking some detours. For example, the four words "mobilize the masses" seem easy, but it is not simple to do. Humbly learning from others is also essential for learning business. The way to learn is to study together with others, gather the experience of the majority, and after your own research, it becomes your own method in business.
    Third, is the specific guidance of the person in charge. Some comrades make progress and learn their own business faster, which is largely due to the guidance of the responsible comrades. Old revolutionaries also encounter new problems. For example, the three-level people's election last year was very different from the past. It is impossible to do it well by using the old methods, so the responsible comrades still need to study at any time in order to more completely guide the subordinate cadres. Some responsible comrades abandon their responsibility to guide the work of cadres, and they should take responsibility for it.
    Fourth, the five areas of learning business pointed out by the central government are not to be learned in isolation. Learning in isolation has a small effect, while learning in connection has a great effect. For example, Comrade Tian Darun, a referee in Dingbian, in his business study, first understood and studied the situation when dealing with some land disputes in which landlords recovered land; second, he studied the section on land issues in "On Coalition Government"; third, he studied the reasons why the government had handled these land disputes several times and they were overturned again; and fourth, he studied the handling methods. After the problem was handled in this way, the masses were very satisfied. Comrade Tian Darun thus learned his business, and at the same time, his thinking methods and work attitude were also improved. This is a question of improving efficiency that is worth studying.

　　怎样学习业务？
    胡其谦
    干部中为什么没有完全实行做什么学什么呢？如生产建设，全体干部也做了，同时也学了，做什么学什么口号是实行了。但生产建设，不是一切干部的业务，各机关部门还有独自的业务，在这方面就没有完全实行做什么学什么的口号，其原因大约有三：（一）干部不安心自己的工作，有的说兴趣不投，作的是行政工作，而志在文艺或其他。工作不感兴趣，不安心了，当然更谈不到一意精通自己的业务了。有的是这山望见那山高，总认为自己的工作岗位不重要，别人的工作岗位重要，或者自己的工作无前途，别人的工作有前途（前途二字有的指地位而言）。干部要求有前途，从求工作进步方面看，这是好的，如从某种工作提拔快，某种提拔慢去看就错了，容易造成地位观念及个人英雄主义的思想。还有一种错误的看法，就是把现在的工作岗位和工作地方看为客栈，住过几天就走的，因此就无意在现在的工作岗位上，把工作好好的进行，学习一些为群众服务的本事，屁股未坐热就想走等等，这当然更谈不到精通自己的业务了。（二）一揽子工作方式的影响。边区是处在地广人稀的农村环境，区乡干部人数少，有的文化又低，单依靠工作系统去进行工作，困难就更多，有些带时间性的工作，非动员各种干部去进行工作，就不可能按期完成任务。这样的结果，常把各部门本身的工作挤掉了，影响到各部门本身业务的钻研。另方面是党政工作不分，影响于业务研究很大，有的把自己的业务弄模糊了，找不到自己的业务，因此也就谈不到自己的精通业务了。（三）领导上注意不够。领导工作是很繁忙的，但仍可在干部教育中，经常领导精通业务的教育，中央的决定，是要全体干部实行的，“任何工作部门的干部，必须学会与精通自己业务”，可见精通业务是每个干部自己的责任，但干部的水准是不一致的，有的干部对本身的业务，如果没有领导上的领导，或者钻不进去，或者钻进去要费太多的时间，这对工作都有影响，至于不安心的干部，还需要作经常的具体的思想教育。因此决定上又说：“领导机关及其负责人，必须指导所属干部有秩序的进行学习”。
    那末，怎样学习业务呢？学习业务，是件先苦后甜的事。当你想把自己工作做好，而又不会的时候，是很苦痛的，当你摸到一些门径的时候，觉得思想尖锐了，也看出一些问题，也解释得通一些问题，处理一些问题，出的岔子较少，精神上便很愉快。究竟怎样学习业务呢？其实中央早已规定明白了，内容有五：研究情况，研究政策法令指示决定，研究经验，研究历史知识，研究有关自己的工作理论。由于自己经验不足，对下级指示的体会就很差，例如去年西北局关于农村支部改造的指示，初看是一般概念，做的时候就出了岔子，以后一面做一面研究，才发现各段话的正确与真实内容，及应如何执行那个指示。这说明我对学习业务无新的意见，只是现在才了解这个问题。
    学习业务，首先要放下包袱，建立业务思想。有些包袱是显而易见的不对，如兴趣不投，不愿钻研现在的业务，个人打算等。其实例如爱好文学，也不妨碍作别的工作，有时间作文学活动，想创作也可以在生活中随时搜集材料，到自己有相当修养了，再作道理也不迟；只有爱好，就早悬鹄的，恐非善策。兴趣是逐渐培养起来的，也是有变化的，以兴趣来决定钻研业务的标准，于工作与自己都是不利的。对于没有业务思想的同志，应作长时间的教育。
    其次是独自刻苦的研究与虚心的向人学习。一些工作原则、经验、理论等都要刻苦研究，才能体会到他的奥妙。自己未体会以前，最好的原则经验等，都是旁人的，不走些冤枉路，有时也难体会到。如“发动群众”四个字，似乎是容易的了，做起来就不简单。虚心向人学习，也是学习业务不可少的，学的办法是与人共同研究，把多数人的经验集中起来，经过自己研究后，就变为自己业务上的办法了。
    第三，是负责人具体指导。有些同志进步和较快的学会自己的业务，得之于负责同志指导之力的很多。老革命遇到新问题的事也有过，例如去年三级人民选举，就和过去不同的多，以旧的办法去指导，就不可能搞好，因此负责同志仍须随时学习，才能更完善的指导所属干部。有的负责同志放弃自己指导干部工作的责任的，还要把责任负起来才好。
    第四，是中央指出学习业务的五个范围，不是孤立的来学习，孤立起来学的作用小，联系起来学习的作用大。例如定边裁判员田大润同志的业务学习，他处理一些地主收回土地的纠纷，首先是了解与研究情况，其次学习论联合政府有关土地问题的一节，第三，研究这些土地纠纷，政府处理几次又翻案的原因，第四才研究处理办法，这样把问题处理后，群众便很满意。田大润同志因此学会了他的业务，同时他的思想方法和工作态度也改进了。这是提高效率很值得研究的一个问题。
