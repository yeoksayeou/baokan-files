Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 3rd, during the student protest against American military atrocities in Tianjin on the 1st, some American soldiers expressed their willingness to return home to the students. When the procession passed the American military camp, more than ten American soldiers took photos with their cameras. Finally, they tore off a large English banner on the wall that read "American Troops Should Return Home Immediately," and held it together in front of their chests, taking several photos. One American soldier muttered, "Return home, return home, find a job!" The students shouted the slogan "Go home!" to the American soldiers in a jeep. An American soldier said, "We can go back, and we are willing to go back." In front of a foreign firm on Zhongzheng Road, an American soldier turned around and asked the students to stick the banner on his back, but was driven away by the American military police beside him.

　　天津部分美兵表示愿意回国
    【新华社延安七日电】据三日天津大公报载称：一日天津学生抗议美军暴行游行中，一部分美兵曾对学生表示愿意回国。队伍经美兵营时，十余美兵各持照像机纷纷照像，最后并将粘在墙上的“美军应立即回国”大幅英文标语揭下，众人同执于胸前，洗浴数张，一个美兵嘟喃着说：“回国回国，找个工作！”学生们向一辆吉普车上的美军大喊“回国去吧”的口号，一美兵说：“我们可以回去，而且我们愿意回去。”中正路某洋行门前一美兵掉过身要学生将标语粘在他的背上，为身旁美宪兵驱走。
