[Reported from the Jilu豫 Front, January 29th by our newspaper] Chiang Kai-shek's troops are suffering losses everywhere, resulting in even more severe troop shortages. Recently, they have been conscripting and forcibly enlisting soldiers on a large scale in various areas they occupy. Our guerrilla force has already begun a struggle to protect recruits. The Chiang Kai-shek Third District Department of Kaocheng went to villages east of Dulouji in late December, ostensibly to gather the masses for speeches, but in reality to capture able-bodied men. Nearly a hundred people were taken away from six villages including Hanzhuang alone, including the son of a landlord in Quanli. Similar situations occurred in the Fourth District. The enemy in the southeast of Cao County is also frantically enlisting soldiers. First, they register the age, height, and build of residents in each village by household. When enlisting, they pursue recruits according to the register. The first phase stipulates five people per township, and there are second and third phases planned. The price to avoid conscription has increased from 800,000 to 1,000,000 (currency not specified). In the first phase, Gaozhuangji alone had fifteen people captured. They came twice in one night, causing mothers and children to cry and scream in chaos. The second phase of conscription has now begun in various townships, with the number of recruits being twice as large as the first phase. To protect able-bodied men and prevent enemy capture, the Kaocheng Guerrilla Force repelled enemies who were seizing recruits in Zhouzhuang and Quanli on December 27th.

    考城我游击队开展保丁斗争
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】蒋军到处损兵折将，兵力更加不足，最近乃在其侵占区各地大批征兵抓兵，我某游击队已开始保丁斗争。考城蒋记三区部，于十二月下旬到杜楼集以东村庄，以召集群众讲话为名，捕捉壮丁，仅韩庄等六庄被拉去者已近百人，圈里一个地主的儿子也被抓去了。在四区也发生同样情形。曹县东南敌人也疯狂抓丁，首先在各村按户登记年龄身材高低等，抓丁时，即按册追要。第一期规定每乡五人，还有第二、第三期。壮丁身价已由八十万增到一百万元。第一期仅高庄集就有十五人被抓，一夜去了两次，闹得娘们孩子齐哭乱叫。现在各乡镇已征到第二期，数目比第一期多一倍。考城游击队为保卫壮丁，防止敌人抓捕，曾于十二月二十七日打退在周庄、圈里抓丁的敌人。
