　　Request to Postpone the Yellow River Breach Closure to Summer
    and Promptly Allocate Resident Relocation Funds
    The Central Plains Assembly Relief Branch of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Sends a Telegram to the UNRRA Branch Office
    All Circles in the Taiyue Region Voice Support for the Self-Salvation Efforts of the People of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Border Region Assembly and Relief Branch of Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and the Central Plains Liberated Area Assembly and Relief Branch, in order to request that the Yellow River breach closure and water release be postponed to this summer, and that UNRRA relief supplies be rationally distributed, have jointly telegraphed the UNRRA China Branch Office. The original telegram is as follows: To Mr. Dong Biwu and Mr. Wu Yunfu of the Nanjing Liberated Area Relief General Association, for transmission to the UNRRA China Branch Office: The relief supplies allocated by UNRRA to China that have reached the Liberated Areas amount to only 0.75 per thousand, which is clearly a result of discrimination by the Kuomintang authorities. Our two regions with 45 million people are extremely indignant and demand that future relief matters concerning the Liberated Areas be discussed directly between the Liberated Area Relief Branch and UNRRA, without going through the Executive Yuan, in order to achieve fair and reasonable distribution. Furthermore, the Yellow River breach closure and water release concerns the lives of millions of residents in the riverbed. It must be carried out only after the downstream repair projects are completed and agreed upon by both parties. The Executive Yuan previously promised to allocate 15 billion yuan for relocation expenses, but has not yet disbursed it. We firmly request that this relocation fee be promptly allocated. Moreover, as the severe winter has arrived, it is impossible to carry out emergency construction projects. The breach closure and water release must be postponed to this summer, in order to prioritize the lives of the people. Otherwise, the Kuomintang authorities shall bear full responsibility for any misfortune that may arise.
    [Dispatch from Taiyue, Our Newspaper, 28th] The traitor Chiang Kai-shek has undermined the Yellow River agreement and is determined to close the breach and release the water in the shortest possible time, attempting to use the Yellow River flood to attack the soldiers and civilians of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan who have caused him to suffer military defeats. All circles in the Taiyue region are indignant and oppose this unprecedentedly cruel and inhumane act, and are determined to lead three million people in supporting the armed self-salvation actions of the people of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The original telegram stated: Chiang Kai-shek, facing military setbacks and at the end of his rope on the Yellow River issue, has no choice but to resort to gangster tactics as a last-ditch struggle. The just action of the people of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan in rising up for armed self-salvation will be vigorously coordinated by the three million people of our Taiyue region, who will support the front lines and strike at the Chiang troops. We also hope that righteous people at home and abroad will step forward and forcefully stop this, and will not stop until the goal is achieved.
