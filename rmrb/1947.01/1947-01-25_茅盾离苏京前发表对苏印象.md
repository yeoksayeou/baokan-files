　　TASS, Moscow, 18th: Before leaving Moscow for Tbilisi, the famous Chinese writer Mao Dun met with a TASS reporter and stated: The purpose of this visit to the Soviet Union is to study the life of the Soviet people and Soviet culture, and to establish closer friendship between writers of China and the Soviet Union. The first thing foreigners notice upon arriving in the Soviet Union is the efforts of the entire Soviet people to surpass pre-war economic levels. During my stay in the Soviet Union, my belief has grown daily that the Soviet people will complete their great five-year plan in a timely manner and raise the national economy to a higher level. I sincerely wish the Soviet people success in their great labor construction. Because the victory of the new Soviet economy and culture will be a guarantee of world peace and democracy.

　　茅盾离苏京前发表对苏印象
    中国名作家茅盾在离开莫斯科赴第夫里斯前接见塔斯社记者称：此次访苏之目的，在于研究苏联人民生活及苏联文化，并在中苏两国作家之间建立更密切的友谊。外国人一到苏联首先注意的是全苏人民为超过战前经济水平所作的努力。我在苏联停留期间，每天都增强我这样的信念：苏维埃人民将及时的完成其伟大的五年计划，并将国民经济提到更高的水平。我诚挚地敬祝苏联人民在他们伟大的劳动建设中成功。因为苏联的新经济及文化的胜利，将是全世界和平民主的保证。
