    Taiyue Bomb Factory
    Greatly Increased Production and Improved Quality
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 5th] The entire staff of the Bomb Factory ×, in order to more effectively support the front lines, have again proposed striving to increase production. When the number of iron smelting furnaces was increased from one to two, although only one-third more workers were added, the output has increased by two-thirds due to the workers' efforts. Similarly, previously each worker completed an average of eleven bomb casings per shift, now each worker completes an average of thirteen or fourteen bomb casings. The master craftsman in the sand casting group who removes "slag" used to remove 167 pieces of slag per day, but now can remove 210 pieces per day. The quality has also been greatly improved. The test results for each bomb show no duds, and the number of fragments is more than fifty. In addition, workers are actively finding ways to save raw materials, and have organized worker pickets to ensure the smooth completion of the work plan.
