　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 9th] The winter weaving movement in Qinshui has unfolded enthusiastically, with the immediate goals of actively improving techniques, striving to increase production, and learning to use the fly-shuttle loom. The first and second districts have organized 1,853 female spinners and 716 female weavers. Ma Guihua, a spinning and weaving hero from Xiaojian Village, leads four spinning and weaving groups, with 32 women centered around four looms. Each family spins the yarn, and they weave collectively. Women with high skills provide hands-on guidance. Weaving was lagging in Xiyu Village, so the cooperative grasped the organization of all women in the village to spin and weave, and stipulated three measures: (1) Organize women who do not know how to spin and weave into five groups, and the cooperative hires technicians Liu Huanmian and two others to provide guidance in rotation. (2) The cooperative provides material rewards to women who spin and weave quickly and well. The cooperative purchases all cotton and tools for the spinning and weaving women on their behalf, charging a foot price. (3) Women who earn wages from spinning and weaving and wish to invest in the cooperative will have 80 cents counted as one yuan. From then on, all women in the village were organized to compete in spinning and weaving. Wangjing Village has begun to learn to use the fly-shuttle loom. Song Tingyao and Wang Shouqin lead the organization of a weaving factory, raising 20,000 yuan in shares, and have cultivated a large number of good spinners and weavers.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 9th] Women in Fushan and Yangcheng are actively spinning and weaving to support the front lines. In Ciying Village, Yangcheng, women organized to spin 850 jin of cotton for the troops, earning wages for 7,200 bolts of cloth. Under the leadership of spinning and weaving heroes Zhao Meiying and Chen Heyi, the weaving women of Fushan are pre-emptively taking 20,000 jin of military cotton, organizing spinning and weaving to ensure that the troops can change seasons next summer. They said, "Spinning and weaving is participating in the war. Not only must we supply the front lines, but also earn profits to solve our own clothing problems."
