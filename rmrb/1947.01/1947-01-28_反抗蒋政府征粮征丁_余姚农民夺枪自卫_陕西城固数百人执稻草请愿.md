    Resisting the Jiang Government's Grain and Conscription
    Yuyao Peasants Seize Guns for Self-Defense
    Hundreds of People in Chenggu, Shaanxi Petition with Straw
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch] According to a Shanghai newspaper report from Yuyao, Zhejiang, dated the 19th of last month: After the conscription office in Yuyao completed the lottery process, the village head and conscription officers deceived the people, saying, "Those drafted are going to the United States for training." But the people knew in their hearts that they were being sent to reinforce the Central Army to fight the Communists in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, they agreed not to go. When the Ba長 [head of ten households] summoned those who were drafted, the village head used "capture" methods against those who did not go. That night, two people were caught, resulting in a payment of two million yuan. Later, the village head was ordered to capture everyone overnight. This time, the draftees prepared to resist and beat the National Soldiers who came to capture them to pieces. One machine gun and twelve rifles were turned over to the draftees. The draftees broke all the guns and threw them into the river. When the National Soldiers in nearby villages heard this news, they were afraid that the draftees would seize their guns, so they had to postpone the conscription.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th dispatch] According to a Shanghai newspaper report dated the 6th, a correspondent in Chenggu, Shaanxi, stated: When the County Council of this county held a meeting in mid-last month, hundreds of villagers, each holding a bundle of straw, went to the County Council to request a halt to conscription and grain requisition. This action is expected to expand to all counties in Hanzhong.

    反抗蒋政府征粮征丁
    余姚农民夺枪自卫
    陕西城固数百人执稻草请愿
    【新华社二十五日电】据沪报载浙江余姚上月十九日通讯称：余姚征兵办过抽签手续后，乡长和兵役员欺骗老百姓，说“抽壮丁是去美国受训的”。但老百姓心里是明白的，是补充中央军到苏北打共产党的，所以他们约定大家不出去，保长召集中签人的时候，谁不去，乡长即采用“捉”的办法。当夜抓到两个又得到两百万元。后来乡长奉令要在一夜捉齐，这次壮丁准备反抗，将来捉他们的国民兵打得七零八落，一挺机枪、十二支步枪都转到壮丁手里。壮丁当都把枪打断抛到河里了。附近各乡国民兵听到此消息，都怕壮丁缴他们的枪，只得暂缓征兵。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据六日沪报载陕西城固通讯：本县参议会于上月中旬开会时，有乡民数百人各执稻草一束，齐赴县参会请求停止征兵征粮，此种行动将扩及汉中各县。
