　　Lu Zhong Bohai Enemy Rear Armed Work Teams
    Effectively Support Border Area Mass Movements
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 6th] The Lu Zhong and Bohai armed work teams, persisting in guerrilla warfare in the Chiang-occupied areas, provide strong cover for land reform in the border areas. Li Kairu's armed work team in a certain district of Zichuan, using the slogan "Unite as one, everyone turns over," shattered the Chiang army's conspiracy to implement "five-household joint responsibility, no guarantee for activists to turn over" to force activists to "surrender," and launched a guard-the-laborer movement, burning household registration books in various villages, depriving the Chiang army of the basis for conscription. More than thirty villages in the district have become guerrilla base areas that the Chiang army cannot rule. The neighboring district's Han Qichun armed work team has also successively restored the democratic power of more than forty villages, and on the 5th of last month, raided the Chiang army's training ground in Boshan, liberating more than 200 conscripted laborers at once, and capturing five people alive, including the Chiang's village chief and deputy of the security team. The Boshan armed work team killed or captured 52 Chiang agents last month, enabling farmers in 129 villages in five border areas to receive more than 5,500 mu of land. Under the defense of the armed work team, more than 20 villages in the 5th and 7th districts of Yishou (new county, between Yidu and Shouguang) in the Bohai area realized "land to the tiller" in less than half a month.

　　鲁中渤海敌后武工队
    有力支援边地群运
    【新华社山东六日电】鲁中及渤海武工队，坚持蒋占区游击战争，予边沿地区土地改革以有力掩护。淄川某区李开鲁武工队，以“团结一致，大家翻身”的口号，粉碎蒋军实施“五家连坐，不给翻身积极分子出保”企图强迫积极分子“自首”的阴谋，并展开护丁运动，焚毁各村户口册，使蒋军失却抓丁依据。该区三十余村已成为使蒋军无法统治的游击根据地。邻区韩其纯武工队，亦相继恢复四十余村的民主政权，并于上月五日袭入博山蒋军操场，一次即解放被抓壮丁二百余人，活捉蒋记乡长保安队副等五名。博山武工队上月内毙俘蒋特五十二名，使五个边沿区一百二十九村农民，分得五千五百余亩土地。在武工队捍卫下，渤海区益寿（新县，益都与寿光之间。）五、七两区二十余个村庄，不到半月即实现了耕者有其田。
