　　Wucheng's Experience in Distributing Fruits
　　Taking Care of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants with Small Families
　　[This newspaper's Weixian dispatch, 17th] In Wucheng's distribution of the fruits of struggle, special care is given to poor and lower-middle peasants with small families. The experience is: 1. When distributing land, individual extremely poor peasants with small families should be taken care of, because extremely poor households are mostly small, even with only one person. If a simple and mechanical standard of several mu of land per person is used to make up the difference, a family of ten people supplemented with thirty mu of land can become self-sufficient by engaging in sideline occupations. But if a family has only one person and is supplemented with three mu of land, they still cannot maintain their livelihood. If they marry a wife and have children, they will be even less able to live. Therefore, extremely poor households with two people should be given more land. If they are young and strong with labor power, they should generally be supplemented to three mu, and a few more mu should be added. If they are old men and women without labor power, they can be given less land and more movable property for their old age. If they are orphans and widows with children, even if they have no labor power at present, they should also be given more land in preparation for the future when the children grow up and cultivate the land themselves. 2. Hired laborers from other villages should also be allocated land, because hired laborers are mostly extremely poor. If they are from the same village, land should be distributed according to their family composition. If they are extremely poor, they should be allocated a few more mu of land at discretion. If some hired laborers have nothing in this village and are willing to settle in another village, they can be allocated land in the same way as the people in this village.

　　武城分配果实经验
    照顾人口少的贫雇农
    【本报威县十七日电】武城分配斗争果实中，特别照顾人口少的贫雇农。经验是：一、分配土地时，应当照顾个别人少的赤贫农，因为赤贫户多半是人少，甚至只有一口人；假如单纯机械的以每人几亩地为标准补齐，一家有十口人补地三十亩，经营副业即可以自给自足。要是一家只有一口人，补三亩地，仍然不能维持生活，如再娶了妻，生了孩子，更不能生活了。所以对两口人的赤贫户多分一些，如系有劳动力的青壮年，一般按三亩补齐，还应多补几亩。如系老头老婆婆没有劳动力，可少分点土地，多分点浮财，以备养老。如系孤寡有小孩，现时虽无劳动力，也应多分点土地，以备将来小孩大了自耕。二、外村雇工也应分到土地，因为雇工多系赤贫；如系本村人，按其家庭成分分地；如系赤贫，酌情多分配他几亩地；如有的雇工在本村什么东西也没有，愿意在外村落户，可以和本村人一样分地。
