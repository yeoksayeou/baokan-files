The Jinnan Second Military Sub-district Sees Another Surge of Enlistments
　　Wucheng Farmers Enlist by Entire Company
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian, 12th dispatch] In order to crush Chiang Kai-shek's army's invasion and strive for the early arrival of brightness, the emancipated farmers of the Jinnan Second Military Sub-district have once again set off a wave of enlistment. One hundred and seventy-six young adults from Wucheng voluntarily formed a company and set off for the front lines. When Enxian's Fourth District celebrated the departure of twenty-three new soldiers to the front lines, new soldier Zhao Ximing said, "In the past, we suffered from hunger and cold, but now we have obtained land. We must protect it no matter what." Village cadres in Fentai Village, Fourth District, competed to enlist. The Farmers' Association Director said, "Enlisting is for the sake of the country and the people, and even more so for oneself. I will not return home until I defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." Wu Changqi, from Yin Cai Village, Third District, Qinghe, is already forty years old. Because of his age, he mobilized his son Rui Lian to go. Rui Lian then led five militiamen to join the army. Lin Shouchong, a model teacher from Nanduzhen, Sixth District, Xiajin, had led students to actively participate in mass movements. During the county's enlistment campaign, he resolutely abandoned his pen and joined the army. Qi De, the Farmers' Association Director of Dali Village, Fourth District, had four sons. One was sacrificed and two were injured in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now that only his youngest son, Xiao Si, remains, he again urged him to enlist and fight against Old Chiang. Influenced by him, several other young people voluntarily signed up. The Director of the Laborers' Union of Ding Village, First District, Gucheng, led three laborers to join the army. After the peasant movement in Chengguan, Gaotang, four young people voluntarily signed up. Five thousand farmers in Chengguan warmly sent them off. Each new soldier was draped in red silk, heading to the front lines amidst the cheers of the masses.
　　[Another dispatch] The Yunhe Middle School Theater Troupe of the sub-district braved the severe cold to conduct enlistment mobilization. In one day, they performed more than ten plays, including "The White-Haired Girl," "Defend Our Homeland," and "Everything for the Front Lines." During the performance of "Glorious Enlistment," seven young people jumped from the crowd onto the stage, shouting, "We will enlist immediately and will not return home until we repel Chiang Kai-shek's army."
