　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd dispatch】Five thousand farmers in Qin County held a meeting in the city to celebrate their emancipation during the New Year. On this day, emancipated farmers Ping Fan @ and Tai Erdong wore newly acquired fur coats and said excitedly, "Today I am emancipated from head to toe. I not only have land and a house, but also a wife." The whole city was decorated with flags and banners, filled with a new atmosphere. After breakfast, farmers from all passes marched into the city in teams. The emancipated farmers in the four streets wore brand-new clothes, leading their returned cattle and sheep, carrying tables full of silver ingots and silver dollars, singing loudly about Chairman Mao and their own emancipation. A total of 7 administrative villages in the Chengguan base area participated in the struggle, involving 1,492 households, reclaiming more than 4,850 mu of land and 1,057 houses. In Nantou Village alone, each emancipated farmer received an average of 4 mu of land, but there were still 85 households that had not participated in the struggle. All the farmers shouted, "Launch the Li Zhaoxiang movement to help the unemancipated farmers to emancipate themselves!" After the meeting, the masses in Nanshihuai launched a struggle overnight, completely crushing feudalism and ensuring that every farmer in the village was emancipated. Even the most backward Nanposhang Village also launched a vigorous struggle.

    落后村连夜进行斗争
    【本报太岳二十二日电】沁县城关于新年召开五千农民庆祝翻身大会。这天，翻身农民屏藩＠、泰二东穿着翻身小皮袄，兴奋异常的说：“今天我是从头翻到底了，不仅有地有房，还娶了媳妇了。”全城悬旗结彩，遍贴标语，洋溢着一片新气象。早饭后，各关的农民结队入城，四街翻身的农民们穿着翻身后崭新的衣服，牵着还家的牛羊，抬着满桌的元宝及银洋，锣鼓喧天的歌唱着毛主席与自己的翻身。城关基点共七个行政村，参加斗争的农民达一千四百九十二户，回土地四千八百五十余亩，房屋一千零五十七间，仅南头村翻身农民每人即平均四亩土地，但仍有八十五户未参加斗争，全体农民便高呼：“开展李兆祥运动，帮助未翻的农民翻身！”大会结束后，南石淮群众连夜进行斗争，彻底打垮了封建，使全村每个农民都翻了身，连最落后的南坡上村，亦轰轰烈烈的展开了斗争。
