　　[Report from the Jiluyu Front, January 10th] (Delayed dispatch) Over a thousand American-equipped troops of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army, occupying Guancheng, launched an offensive eastward on the 3rd, under the cover of eight tanks and eight armored vehicles. They encountered fierce resistance at Liuli Jing, suffering over fifty casualties. Our army lost only one soldier, and two heroes emerged. One is Ji Qiquan, the hero who fought the tanks. He was liberated from the reorganized 3rd Division. In this battle, he killed two Chiang army commanders of tanks and infantry. The other is the heroic platoon leader Song Huating, who commanded the defense. When the Chiang army charged under the cover of tanks, he skillfully and vigilantly commanded a platoon, fixed bayonets, and prepared hand grenades to resist the enemy, scaring them into not daring to advance. When the enemy once again attacked our positions, Platoon Leader Song held a small cannon and fired eight consecutive shots, each hitting the target, killing or wounding over ten enemies and repelling the enemy's attack.

　　[Report from the Jiluyu Front, January 12th] To relieve the siege of Jinxiang and Yutai, Chiang's troops, Liu Ruzhen, Mi Wenhe, and Zhang Lanfeng, personally led their remnants to launch an offensive eastward. They have now arrived at Tianji, forty miles west of Jinxiang, and are in contact with our forces.
　　[Report from the Jiluyu Front, January 12th] (Delayed dispatch) Supplementary Communiqué on the Battle of Liaocheng: After our army liberated Liaocheng on New Year's Day, we pursued the enemy in victory.
