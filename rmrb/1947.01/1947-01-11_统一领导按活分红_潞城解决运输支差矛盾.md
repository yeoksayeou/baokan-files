　　Unified Leadership, Profit Sharing Based on Work
    Lucheng Resolves Contradictions in Transport Support
    [Reported by this newspaper] Lucheng combines transportation and support work to resolve the contradiction between winter production and supporting the front lines. The methods are as follows: 1. Unified leadership, rotating transportation, profit sharing based on work. Villages such as Luhe in the Third District, rate all village livestock as fixed shares based on size, strength, and weakness, and voluntarily form groups under the unified leadership of the village cooperative. The groups are divided into two shifts, rotating in and out, with one shift engaged in long-term transportation outside the village and the other shift engaged in short-term transportation at home, responsible for supporting work. Whether for support work or transportation, the cooperative first provides 400 to 500 yuan for expenses. The cooperative also sends people out to solicit work, ensuring that no livestock is idle. Accounts are settled every half-month or month, with profits shared based on work points for both support work and transportation, using a "fixed share with flexible adjustment" approach. In some places, the original shares are further increased or decreased during accounting based on performance, to show rewards. 2. Substituting support work, profit sharing based on work. In some places in the Fourth District, in addition to the livestock being rated as fixed shares as above, some are engaged in long-term specialized transportation outside the village, while others are engaged in short-term transportation at home and substitute for them in support work. When settling accounts, the cost of support workers is paid from the profits earned by long-term transportation workers, based on mileage and livestock shares.

　　统一领导按活分红
    潞城解决运输支差矛盾
    【本报讯】潞城运输支差结合，解决冬季生产与支援前线的矛盾，办法如下：一、统一领导，轮流运输，按分分红。三区潞河等村，把村牲口全按大、小、强、弱评为死分，自愿结成小组，由村合作社统一领导。小组分为两班，轮流调换，一班在外长期运输，一班在家短期运输，负责支差。不论支差、运输均先由合作社发给四百至五百元盘费。合作社并派专人出外揽活，保证不闲一个牲口。半月或一月算一次账，支差、运输按分数统一分红；有的地方在算账时根据成绩好坏，再增减原分数以示奖励。即是“死分活折”。二、代替支差、按活分红。四区有的地方，除牲口定分与上述相同外，一部在外长期专门运输，一部在家短期运输，并代替他们出差；算账时，按里数与牲口分数由长期运输人应得之红利内支付支差人的代价。
