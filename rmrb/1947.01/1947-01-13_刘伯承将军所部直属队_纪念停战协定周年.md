General Liu Bocheng's Department Directly Subordinate Units
	Commemorate the Anniversary of the Ceasefire Agreement
	Pledge to support the student movement in Peiping (Beijing) and Tianjin protesting against the U.S. military with heroic fighting, firmly insisting that the U.S. military immediately get out of China; and request the democratic government to designate November 4th as National Humiliation Memorial Day.
[This newspaper's front-line dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu, 12th] General Liu Bocheng's directly subordinate units held a discussion meeting on the 10th to commemorate the Ceasefire Agreement and the Political Consultative Conference. On this day last year, General Liu's troops were encircling and annihilating the enemy puppet troops who refused to surrender, ordering them to immediately lay down their arms. At the discussion meeting, many people had personally participated in this work. They discussed the situation at the time, saying: On the Liaocheng front, they had already scaled the city walls; on the Yanzhou front, coordinating with the Shandong Liberation Army, they had already entered the city gate; and on the Yongnian front, deployments had also been completed and actions had begun. Just as the battle was about to be completely resolved, a ceasefire order suddenly came from the sky. General Liu Bocheng personally emphasized the great historical significance of the ceasefire order to the commanders by telephone and strictly ordered them to immediately withdraw from the battle. Unexpectedly, to this day, the puppet army leaders Wang Jinxiang of Liaocheng, Xu Tieying of Yongnian, and Wu Huawen of Yanzhou, etc., have not only not been punished, but have also received American equipment after being promoted by Chiang Kai-shek, and are even more boldly poisoning the people. Chiang Kai-shek's army, possessing full American armaments, is even transported by the U.S. military to invade the Liberated Areas on a large scale.
	At this time, the atmosphere at the meeting gradually became tense. When talking about the various secret agreements between the U.S. and Chiang to destroy China and the recent incident of U.S. troops raping a female student at Peking University, the crowd's grief and anger reached their peak. Speakers rose one after another, expressing deep sympathy and respect for the patriotic self-defense movement of students in Peiping, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, hoping that this great patriotic movement would continue to unfold and cooperate with the patriotic self-defense war of the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas to save the peril of the Chinese nation. Specific opinions can be divided into four points: First, to express condolences to the victimized female students, and resolutely advocate that the U.S. side must severely punish the perpetrators and compensate for the losses. Second, to pay tribute to the students participating in the movement, and all commanders and fighters of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu vow to support them with all their strength. Third, resolutely advocate that the U.S. military immediately get out of China. Fourth, request the democratic government to order that November 4th, the day the nation-destroying Chiang-U.S. commercial treaty was signed, be designated as the new National Humiliation Memorial Day. How to express these meanings? One person said: "We don't need to send telegrams. We only need to fight bravely until we restore the position of January 13th last year. Chiang Kai-shek is using more than 85% of his strength to fight the Liberated Areas. As long as we defeat these forces, an independent, democratic, united, and new China can emerge. This is the most effective way for us to express condolences to the victims and support students in various places." Everyone agreed with his opinion. At this time, the good news of annihilating more than 9,000 Chiang's troops near Yutai happened to arrive. Everyone dispersed from the meeting amidst warm applause.

　　刘伯承将军所部直属队
    纪念停战协定周年
  　誓以英勇作战支援平津等地学生抗议美军运动，坚主美军立即滚出中国去；并请民主政府规定十一月四日为国耻纪念日。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十二日电】刘伯承将军所部直属队，十日举行座谈会，纪念停战协定与政协会议。去年今日，刘将军所部正围歼拒绝投降之敌伪军，令其立即缴械。座谈会中，有不少人曾亲身参加此项工作，彼等谈论当时情形谓：聊城方面已攀登城墙，兖州方面配合山东解放军已攻入城关；永年方面亦已部署完毕，开始动作。恰在即将彻底解决战斗之际，停战令忽从天而至。刘伯承将军即亲自用电话向各指挥官强调指出停战令之伟大历史意义，严令立即撤出战斗。不料时至今日，伪军首领聊城王金祥、永年许铁英、兖州吴化文等，不仅未受惩处，且在蒋介石加官进爵之后，获得美式装备，更加大胆荼毒人民。拥有充分美式武装之蒋介石军，更由美军运送，大举进犯解放区。
    此时会场空气逐渐紧张，说至美蒋各种灭亡中国密约及最近北平美军强奸北大女生事，群情悲愤达于顶点。发言者此起彼继，对平津京沪学生之爱国自卫运动莫不表示深切之同情与尊敬，愿此伟大之爱国运动继续展开，与解放区军民之爱国自卫战争互相配合以挽救中华民族之危亡。具体意见可分四点：一、慰问被害之女同学，坚决主张美方必须严惩罪犯，赔偿损失。二、向参加运动诸同学致敬，晋冀鲁豫全体指战员誓以全力支援。三、坚决主张美军立即滚出中国去。四、请民主政府命令规定签订亡国的蒋美商约之十一月四日为新的国耻纪念日。怎样表示这些意思呢？有一个人说：“我们不必发通电，我们唯有英勇作战，直到恢复去年一月十三号的位置为止。蒋介石把他百分之八十五以上的兵力来打解放区，只要我们打垮了这些力量，独立民团主结统一的新中国就能出现。这就是我们慰问被害者与支援各地同学最有效的办法。”大家同意了他的意见。此时，恰巧鱼台附近歼灭蒋军九千余人的捷报传来。大家乃在热烈的掌声中散会。
