    Battlefield New Year Sketches
    Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Li Pu
    At one o'clock on New Year's Day morning—the first hour of 1947, the southern line of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region recovered Juye City; at three o'clock in the morning, the northern line liberated Liaocheng; at eight o'clock in the evening, the southern line recovered Jiaxiang City again. When the frontline headquarters had a New Year's Eve dinner, the leaders did not attend because everyone knew that another victory was coming; but no one expected it to come so quickly.
    The frontline headquarters has been somewhat festive these past two days. The directly subordinate teams practiced target shooting and throwing grenades, and the reporter also tried three shots.
    Two evening parties have been held together in the past two days, with four plays performed. The main characters, Wang Keqin, Lü Dengke, etc., are all known heroes and models. Performing battle scenes on the battlefield has a special flavor. Before the play, photographs and drawings of prisoners and spoils of war were exhibited.
    While the past battle heroes and already well-known heroic figures were being played out on the stage, new battles were unfolding, new heroes were emerging in large numbers, and prisoners were being sent in droves.
    Late on New Year's Eve, I went to the headquarters and met General Li Da, the chief of staff. He clapped his hands and shouted loudly, "Well done! Well done!" Yan'an Radio began a broadcast speech by the famous reporter Fan Changjiang. When he mentioned that forty-six brigades of Chiang Kai-shek had been wiped out within half a year, we couldn't wait to tell him to add another brigade. A wire connected the headquarters and the front line, and we seemed to see how they waded through water and climbed the city walls in the rain of artillery fire, as if we saw them counting the prisoners and spoils of war in a chaotic manner in the dark. Wang Jinxiang, the famous puppet army of the Japanese era, was entrenched in Liaocheng. Chiang Kai-shek regarded them as treasures, but now there is no way; Chiang Kai-shek occupied Juye and Jiaxiang counties at the cost of a large amount of manpower, but now they are finished.
    On New Year's Day morning, I went to the headquarters again. The headquarters was giving orders to the liberators of Liaocheng, telling them to pay homage to the tomb of General Fan Zhuxian, who was loyal and brave in the war of resistance, and ordered them to take special care to protect the "Haiyuan Pavilion" library, which is one of the three famous book collectors in China.
    In the evening, Mao Zedong's New Year's greetings and Commander Zhu De's speech came from the radio. They pointed out that this year will be a year of great transformation and victory, and everyone deeply felt that a good start was being made here.

    战地新年速写
    新华社特派记者  李普
    元旦清晨一点钟——一九四七的第一个钟头，冀鲁豫南线收复了巨野城；清晨三点钟，北线解放了聊城；晚上八点钟，南线又收复了嘉祥城。前线总部除夕聚餐的时候，首长们没有参加，大家知道又要打胜仗了；但是都没有想到会来得这样快。
    前线总部这两天很有点儿过年景象。直属队练习打靶、丢手榴弹，记者也去试验了三枪。
    这两天又一起开演了两次晚会，演了四个戏，主角王克勤、吕登科等，都是大家所知的英雄模范。在战地演战斗戏，特别有风味。演戏前，并展览了俘虏和战利品的摄影和图画。
    当台上正扮演过去的战斗英雄和已经知名的英雄人物的时候，新的战斗又在展开，新的英雄又在大量涌现，俘虏又在大批送来。
    除夕深夜，我走到司令部，见到参谋长李达将军，他拍手大声的叫着：“打得好！打得好！”延安电台此时开始名记者范长江氏的广播演说，当他提到半年内消灭了蒋介石四十六个旅时，我们恨不得立刻告诉他再加上一个旅。一根电线把总部和前线联在一起，我们仿佛看到他们怎样冒着雨一样的炮火涉水爬城，仿佛看见他们在黑夜里乱哄哄的清点俘虏和战利品。盘踞聊城的是日本人时代的著名伪军王金祥，蒋介石把他们当宝贝，如今没有办法了；蒋介石以很大的有生力量为代价侵占了的巨野与嘉祥县城，如今也完蛋了。
    元旦清早，我又到司令部去。司令部正在下命令给聊城的解放者，叫他们去拜谒忠勇抗战的范筑先将军的陵墓，并命令他们加意保护“海源阁”的藏书库，这是中国有名的三大藏书家之一。
    晚上，收音机里传来毛主席的新年祝词、朱德司令的演讲，他们指出今年将是大转变的胜利的一年，大家深深感到在这里正在做着一个很好的开端。
