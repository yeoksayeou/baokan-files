Moscow Broadcast Commentary: Eradicating the Influence of American Imperialism is a Prerequisite for Solving the China Problem

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: A Moscow broadcast on the 15th: Commentator Liechev, commenting on the China issue, stated: "Throughout last year, the Kuomintang army never ceased its attacks on the People's Liberation Army. The so-called peace talks were merely a cover for its redeployment of forces in preparation for new offensives. At the beginning of this year, just as at the beginning of last year, the Kuomintang authorities have shown no intention of establishing domestic peace. They convened the 'National Assembly' and passed the so-called 'Constitution,' the sole purpose of which is to wage civil war and obtain a 'legal' basis for foreign aid to the Kuomintang army." Liechev further quoted American newspapers criticizing the U.S. government's aid to the Kuomintang, and stated: "Foreign aid to Chinese reactionaries is the primary factor in exacerbating the tense political situation in China." Liechev also stated: "The Kuomintang warlords are even using Japanese officers to assist them in their civil war. Truman's statement last December claimed that the U.S. military had assisted China in repatriating all Japanese prisoners of war, but this is not the case. A few days ago, the Shanghai Millard's Review reported that a large number of Japanese soldiers remain in the Kuomintang army, and several former high-ranking Japanese officers are now working in the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing." Liechev concluded: "The prerequisite for solving the China problem is, first and foremost, to eradicate foreign influence that assists the domestic reactionary forces in China."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 13th, Moscow Radio, citing "well-informed sources," including Millard's Review, stated: "Many former high-ranking Japanese officers have changed their names to Chinese names and are now working in the Chinese Ministry of National Defense." The broadcast continued: "It is rumored that in the near future, another 100 Japanese officers will arrive in China from Japan to help train the Kuomintang army. This move has been approved by the U.S. occupation authorities in Japan."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Information from various sources reveals that the Chiang government's plan to sell Chinese seaports and airports is being actively implemented. Following the news that the northeastern seaports are about to be "Americanized," a Central News Agency dispatch from Keelung, Taiwan, on the 11th stated: "Keelung Port has already established 'direct trade' with the United States. A large number of American ships arrived in Keelung for the first time last month, and the Keelung Customs authorities have been ordered to officially open the port to Japanese cargo ships."

　　解决中国问题先决条件是铲除美帝国主义影响
    莫斯科广播评论称
    【新华社延安十六日电】莫斯科十五日广播：评论员列奇于评论中国问题时称：去年一年，国民党军没有一天停止过进攻人民解放军，所谓和谈只不过是掩盖其重新布置兵力，准备新进攻而已。今年初，也像去年初一样，国民党当局没有树立国内和平的意愿，它曾召集“国大”，通过所谓“宪法”，其作用不过是进行内战，以及为外国对国民党军的援助取得“合法”的根据而已。列氏进而摘引美国各报对美政府援助国民党的批评，并称：外国对于中国反动派的援助，是使中国政治情况紧张化的主要因素。列氏又称：国民党军阀甚至利用日本军官帮助其进行内战。杜鲁门去年十二月声明中所谈美军已协助中国将日俘遣送完毕，但事实并非如此，几天前上海密勒评论报即报导现有大量日军留在国民党军中，而且有几个前日本高级官现在南京国民党国防部工作。列氏结语称：解决中国问题的先决条件，首先是铲除协助中国国内反动势力的外国影响。
    【新华社延安十五日电】据美联社伦敦十三日电，莫斯科广播电台引用包括密勒氏评论周刊在内的“灵通方面”消息称：好些前日军高级军官改用中国姓名，现在中国国防部中工作。广播继称：“据传在不久的将来，将另有日本军官一百名由日抵华，以帮助训练国民党军队，此举曾得日本美占领当局之认可。”
    【新华社延安十四日电】各方消息显露蒋政府出卖中国海港机场之计划正在积极实施中。继东北海港即将“美化”消息后，据中央社台湾基隆十一日电称：基隆港已与美国“直接通商”，大批美船上月首次抵达基隆，基隆海关当局并已奉令正式开放日本之货船。
