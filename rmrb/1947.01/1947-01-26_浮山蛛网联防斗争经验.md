    Fushan "Spider Web" Joint Defense Struggle Experience
    Taiyue Branch
    After the Chiang army occupied Fushan City, the First District was at the forefront of the struggle against the enemy. From September to now, under the dual political and military offensive of the enemy, cadres led the masses and militia guerrillas to create a "spider web" joint defense, waged a tenacious struggle against the enemy, struck the enemy, persisted in their work, and protected the interests of the masses. Recently, they have restricted the enemy to the empty city of Shanxiao, daring not to come out easily to capture people and loot things. The district's expanded cadre meeting made a preliminary summary.

    First, the militia actively operates in conjunction with the interests of the masses. When the enemy was preparing to attack Fushan, the leadership fully mobilized the cadres and the masses against the stubborn enemy, making ideological preparations. When the enemy invaded, the district cadres personally led the militia to cover the masses in a thorough "empty house, clear field" policy, so that the enemy could not catch a single person or find a single thing to eat. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting season, the militia and home-guard teams went to the enemy's strongholds every day to monitor and besiege the enemy, covering the masses' rush to harvest, plant, and evacuate. The Dongguo home-guard team even snatched back a bundle of green onions that the enemy had looted while covering the autumn harvest. Dong Erli, two miles from the city, had nothing stolen by the enemy, and the enemy's three looting plots in Wu's Slope were all crushed. This protected the interests of the masses, strengthened the relationship with the masses, and laid a favorable foundation for carrying out guerrilla warfare, reducing the enemy's range of activities day by day.

    Second, carry out the anti-"Wei Yuanzhou Thought" movement to strengthen the confidence of the masses and cadres in the struggle against the enemy. Wei Yuanzhou was a member of the Xi Zuo Village farmers' association. When the enemy came, he did not have time to evacuate and was captured by the enemy to do errands. The enemy battalion commander talked to him all night, and the next day released him, giving him a "dou" of wheat and 500 yuan. When he returned, he promoted "maintaining" the enemy. At the same time, the enemy took advantage of the masses' time to return to harvest and used threats and inducements in various villages, attempting to deceive the masses. The leadership immediately studied the enemy's conspiracy and the thoughts of the masses and cadres, carried out the anti-Wei Yuanzhou Thought struggle, exposed the atrocities and conspiracies of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army, so that the masses deeply recognized the enemy's face and realized that "maintaining" the enemy would inevitably lead to endless disasters, and that only by arming themselves and resolutely defending themselves could they survive. Therefore, the cadres, masses, and militia became stronger, and their confidence in victory was greatly enhanced.

    Third, the leadership and organization are suitable for the requirements of war, and cadres play a leading role. At this time, the joint defense struggle was proposed. First, the leadership and organization were adapted to the requirements of the war, and × group headquarters were established separately according to the region, becoming the × main command points of the "spider web" joint defense. They were composed of × to × district cadres, with precise division of labor. The Armed Forces Committee cadres specialized in leading the militia activities, the political power cadres were responsible for leading the command, and the farmers' association cadres were responsible for leading intelligence and traitor elimination work. The group headquarters led ×× to ×× militiamen as the backbone armed forces in the district, and the village headquarters led the village office and the home-guard team to fight against the enemy. According to the terrain, iron-stone defense lines and guard lines were established to form a vertical and horizontal "spider web". At the same time, after the enemy occupied Fushan City, because District Chief Qin Zongtang personally led the Chengguan Group militia to actively operate in the Tiantan Mountain and Yaomiao Mountain areas, attacking the enemy every day, the Donglu Group, Gecun Group, and Xiaowei Group, under the leadership of Zhang Dingbao, Nian Wenyi, Chen Peng and others, looked for gaps to attack the enemy everywhere, trained the militia, strengthened their confidence in the struggle against the enemy, and became familiar with the techniques of sniping and attacking the enemy. The charge battle in Chengnan Village and the sabotage of the Linfen Highway were all led by Qin Zongtang. At the same time, under his influence, even timid people became brave. Zheng Jingshou, Wei Huaiding, and others who never dared to move before have now been trained to dare to move in villages one mile from the city.

    In tactics, various tactics are comprehensively used, including sniping, landmine warfare, thunder-gun warfare, sparrow warfare, and larger-scale ambush and encirclement warfare, grasping the enemy's situation and adopting various tactics. All of these show that organizational leadership suitable for the requirements of war and cadres taking the lead are one of the important factors in developing guerrilla warfare and achieving victory.

    Fourth, grasp the enemy's activity patterns and study effective countermeasures in a timely manner. The political opposition to Wei Yuanzhou Thought was successful because of the timely analysis of the situation and the study of countermeasures. Now we are starting to do this in the military as well. When the enemy adopts various activities such as decentralized small-group ambushes, arson, capturing people, and looting grain, we promptly put forward slogans against ambush, against arson, against conscription, and against looting grain among the militia and cadres. We use terrain conditions to establish iron-stone defense lines, and use buried stone mines and sniping to ensure that the enemy is attacked, chased, and harassed by the militia on all sides, limiting the enemy outside the blockade line. Sometimes the militia even ran around the enemy's bunkers to distribute slogans and leaflets, gather intelligence, and shout, making the enemy uneasy day and night, increasing their fatigue and fear. The guard line has become the eyes and ears of the joint defense, as well as the eyes and ears of the masses.

    浮山蛛网联防斗争经验
    太岳分社
    蒋军侵占浮山城后，一区即处在对敌斗争的最前线，从九月到现在，在敌人政治军事双重进攻下，干部领导群众及民兵游击队创造了蛛网联防，向敌顽进行了顽强的斗争，打击了敌人，坚持了工作，保护了群众利益。最近又把敌人限制在陕小的空城中，不敢轻易出来抓人抢东西了。该区的扩大干部会议上曾作了一个初步总结。
    第一、民兵结合群众利益积极活动。当敌人准备进攻浮山时，领导上对干部和群众便进行充分的反顽动员，作了思想准备，敌人进犯时，便由区干部亲自领导民兵，掩护群众彻底空室清野，使敌人抓不到一个人，找不到一点吃的。当秋收种麦时期，民兵和保家队就每天到敌人据点周围监视围困敌人，掩护群众抢收抢种和转移，东郭保家队在掩护秋收时，连敌人抢去的一捆大葱都夺回来了，离城二里的东二里没有被敌人抢走过东西，吴家坡敌人三次抢劫的阴谋都被粉碎。这样便保卫了群众的利益，密切了群众关系，奠定了开展游击战争的有利条件，使敌人的活动范围一天比一天缩小。
    第二、开展反“卫元周思想”运动，坚定群众和干部对敌斗争的信心。卫元周是西左村农会常委，当敌人来时没赶得及转移，被敌人抓去支差，敌营长和他谈了一夜话，第二天放回来，并给他一斗麦子五百元钱，他回来便宣传“维持”敌人，同时敌人利用群众回去秋收的时间，在各村实行威胁利诱等，企图欺骗群众。领导上当即研究了敌人的阴谋及群众和干部的思想，开展反卫元周思想斗争，揭发蒋伪军的暴行及其阴谋，使群众深刻认识敌人的面貌，觉悟到“维持”敌人一定要招来无穷无尽的祸害，只有武装起来坚决自卫才是活路，因此干部群众和民兵更加坚强起来，胜利信心也大大提高了。
    第三、领导组织适合战争要求，干部起带头作用。这时提出了联防斗争，首先领导组织为适合战争的要求，按地区分别成立了×个集团指挥部，便成为蛛网联防的×个主要指挥点，由×个至×个区干部组成，并精密分工，武委会干部专门带领民兵活动，政权干部负责领导指挥部，农会干部负责领导情报除奸工作，集团指挥部领导民兵××人至××人做为区内骨干武装，村指挥部领导村公所及保家队，向敌人进行斗争。又根据地形，建立铁石防线和警卫线，组成纵横的蛛网。同时敌占浮山城后，由于区长秦宗汤亲自带领了城关集团民兵在天坛山、尧庙山一带积极活动，每天袭击敌人，东鲁集团、葛村集团、小卫集团在张定宝、年文艺、陈朋等领导下，到处找空隙打击敌人，锻炼了民兵，坚定了对敌斗争信心，熟悉了打冷枪和袭击敌人的技术，城南村的冲锋战、临汾公路的破击都是秦宗汤领导的。同时在他的影响下，使胆小的人都胆大起来，郑敬寿、卫怀定等从不敢活动，现已锻炼到敢于去离城一里的村里活动。
    在战术上，综合各种战法，有冷枪战、地雷战、雷枪战、麻雀战及较大规模的伏击战、包围战，把握敌情采取各种战术。所有这些都说明：组织领导适合战争要求和干部带头，是展开游击战取得胜利的重要因素之一。
    第四、掌握敌人活动规律，及时研究有效对策。在政治上反卫元周思想，是做到及时分析情况和研究对策而得到成功的。现在在军事上也开始这样做，在敌人采用分散小股伏击、打火、抓人、抢粮等各种活动时，便在民兵和干部中及时提出反埋伏、反打火、反抓丁、反抢粮的口号，以地形条件建立铁石防线，用埋石雷、打冷枪使敌人一出一入、侧翼后方，都受到民兵打击、追击、扰击，限制敌人于封锁线以外。有时民兵还跑到敌人碉堡周围散发标语、传单，捉情报、喊话，使敌人日夜不安，增加其疲劳和恐惧。警备线成为联防的眼睛耳朵，也是群众的眼睛和耳朵。
