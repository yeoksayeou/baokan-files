    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong Front, January 25th: Zhou Yuying and Han Shiru, the commander and deputy commander of the Chiang Kai-shek army's reorganized 51st Division (formerly the commander and deputy commander of the 51st Army), were captured by the East China People's Liberation Army in the battle to recapture Zaozhuang on the 20th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong Front, January 25th: In the recent battle to recapture Yixian, the artillery of the East China People's Liberation Army displayed great power. Half an hour before the general offensive on the city, dozens of heavy artillery and howitzers were fired simultaneously, shaking the earth. In more than 30 minutes, more than 3,000 shells were fired, an average of 100 shells per minute, overwhelming nearly 30 cannons of the Chiang Kai-shek army entrenched in the city with the superior firepower of the People's Liberation Army. In a very short period of time, the fortifications were completely destroyed, and the People's Liberation Army stormed into the city in one fell swoop, annihilating all 7,000 enemy troops of the 51st and 52nd Divisions entrenched in the city. From the start of the general offensive to the end of the battle, it took less than five hours.

    【新华社鲁南前线二十五日电】此次收复峄县之战中，华东人民解放军炮兵大显神威。在总攻该城半小时前，数十门重炮、榴弹炮一齐发放，声震天地。三十余分钟内，即发射三千余弹，平均每分钟放射炮弹百发，使侵踞该城蒋军的近三十门大炮全被人民解放军的优势火力所压倒。在极短时间内，工事摧毁无余，解放军遂一举突入城内，将盘踞该城之五十一师五十二师各一部共七千余人全部歼灭。从开始总攻到结束战斗，不到五小时。
