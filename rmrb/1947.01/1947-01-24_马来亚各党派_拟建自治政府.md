Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Singapore news: On the 14th of last month, the Singapore Malayan Democratic Union invited various parties to hold a joint meeting and immediately established the All-Malaya Parties "Joint Action Committee." Chen Zhenlu, an overseas Chinese from Malacca, was elected as chairman, the Malayan Nationalist Party as vice-chairman, the Malayan Democratic Union as secretary-general, the Indian National Congress as in charge of finance, and other organizations such as the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions, the Clerks' Association, the Straits Chinese British Association, the Eurasian Association, the Indian Chamber of Commerce, and the Indian Ceylonese Association as members. The Malayan Communist Party did not formally join, but the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions, which is led by the Malayan Communist Party, serves as a committee member. The goal of the Joint Action Committee is to establish a responsible autonomous government with a central authority elected by universal suffrage, and to oppose the Malayan Union plan officially announced by the British government in January of last year. The Min Sheng Pao commented that the establishment of the Joint Action Committee is a "milestone in the history of Malaya's struggle for democracy."
