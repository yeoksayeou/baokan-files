[This dispatch was] Transmitted by our newspaper's reporters in the Ji-Lu-Yu [Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan] region on the 29th: When the Yellow River water reached Qinghemen in Dong'a County on the 25th, part of it flowed back into the low-lying areas of Dongping, and part of it flowed eastward along the old course through Pingyin, at a speed of three *li* per hour. After the Yellow River changed its course eight years ago, the democratic government had already excavated diversion channels to drain the accumulated water from the low-lying areas of Dongping and had developed more than 100 villages and over 3,000 *qing* of fertile land. Now, the Yellow River water has once again flooded into the low-lying areas of Dongping, submerging more than 200 *qing* of farmland and over 30 villages. Local residents, with the assistance of the democratic government, are rescuing property and relocating their homes.

[This dispatch was] Transmitted by our newspaper's reporters in the Ji-Lu-Yu [Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan] region on the 27th: As the liberated area's soldiers and civilians joyfully celebrated the Lunar New Year, residents along the Yellow River watched helplessly as their wheat fields were submerged and their houses collapsed. Faced with this unprecedented disaster, they all vehemently cursed Chiang Kai-shek's vicious conspiracy. An affluent peasant, Old Man Li, from Yunbei, whose land was all within the embankment, has now had it completely washed away. He told reporters: "This water release by Old Chiang has flooded the land and destroyed the houses. Everything is gone! The wolf-hearted thief!" Residents of Songzhuang, while salvaging their belongings, sighed and said, "Old oxen and old horses die at their old homes. Moving outside is so difficult! But when the water comes, the old houses are all washed away. What can we do! Chiang Kai-shek is truly ruthless!" A peddler from the south bank of the Yellow River in Yunbei went to the old city market (north of the Yellow River) early on the 16th. When he returned, the Yellow River water had already arrived, but he had to go home. He took off his cotton-padded clothes and waded through the water, which reached his chest, and was struck by ice floes. He immediately fainted upon reaching the shore, his whole body frozen, and died without being rescued. Afterwards, the villagers nearby felt an increased hatred towards the Chiang bandits. When Lin Gonglan from Guan Temple heard that the repair and defense section was organizing sailors, he voluntarily joined. He said, "One is so that the common people don't have to wade through the river when crossing, and the other is to facilitate the army's fight against Chiang Kai-shek. We must fiercely beat this traitorous thief; he's the one who caused our families to be broken up and ruined!"

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th: The Bohai Liberated Area Council has issued a letter to compatriots, calling on the nine million people in the entire area to mobilize urgently to repair river embankments and rise up to save themselves. The declaration states: "Our people in the Bohai area, in order to implement the agreement, have disregarded all human and material difficulties to carry out risk repair and embankment restoration projects. However, the Chiang side has broken the agreement, mobilized large armies to attack our old course areas north and south of the Yellow River, and dispatched large numbers of bandits and special agents to assassinate our river management staff and sabotage the embankment restoration projects, making it impossible for the projects to proceed and for residents to relocate. Now, disregarding the downstream embankment restoration situation, they have brazenly breached the breach and released water. The surging Yellow River water is rushing in, and disaster for our area's nine million people is imminent. In addition to lodging a serious protest with the Chiang side's UNRRA, we specifically call on the nine million compatriots in the entire area to immediately organize, rescue and repair, block the Yellow River water, and prevent disaster."

    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】黄水于二十五日流至东阿县清河门时，一部由此倒灌入东平洼地，一部倾向旧道，由平阴东流，流速每小时三里。八年前黄河改道后，民主政府已挖掘引河将东平洼地之积水排出，并已开辟百余村庄和三千多顷肥田。现黄水又灌入东平洼地，已淹没二百余顷田地和三十余村庄。当地居民，在民主政府协助下，正抢救财物迁移住地。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十七日电】解放区军民欢度旧历新年之际，黄河沿岸居民，却眼看着麦地被淹没，房屋被冲坍。面对着这个空前的灾难，他们对蒋介石的毒辣阴谋均痛骂不绝。郓北一个富农李老先生的地都在堤内，现已全被冲光，他对记者说：“老蒋这一放水，地淹了，房冲啦，什么都完啦，狼心的贼啊！”宋庄居民一面抢运东西，一面叹息说：“老牛老马死旧家，搬到外面是多么不容易啊！可是，水一来，老屋都给冲了，有啥办法呢！蒋介石，真狠心！”郓北黄河南岸的一个小贩，于十六日早晨去赶旧城集（黄河北岗），回来时黄水已到，但是他不能不回家，便脱掉棉衣涉水，水齐胸部，且有冰块击撞，上岸时当即晕倒，全身冻僵，不救而死。事后附近村民对蒋贼仇恨激增。关寺林公蓝听说修防段组织水手，他自动参加，他说：“一是为老百姓过河不用趟水，二是载军队打蒋介石方便，非得狠打这个卖国贼不行，都是他弄得我们家破人亡！”
    【新华社山东二十九日电】渤海解放区参议会顷发表告同胞书，号召全区九百万人民紧急动员起来抢修河堤，奋起自救。宣言称：我渤海区人民为执行协议，曾不顾一切人力物力困难进行修险复堤工程，而蒋方背弃协议，调动大军进攻我黄河南北故道地区，派遣大批匪特暗杀我治河员工，破坏复堤工程，使得工程无法进行，居民无法迁移。今更不顾下游复堤情况，悍然堵口放水。滔滔黄水汹涌而来，我区九百万人民的灾难迫在眉睫。我们除向蒋方联总行总提出严重抗议外，特号召全区九百万同胞立即组织起来，抢救抢修，堵住黄水，防止成灾。
