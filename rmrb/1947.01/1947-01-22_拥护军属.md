　　Supporting Military Families (Ballad)
    By Li Fan
    Drums beat, *yangge* dances,
    Supporting military families is so lively,
    Backs carry sacks, shoulders carry poles,
    A group of men and women are coming over.
    Uncle Zhang is invited,
    And Sister-in-law Li is invited too,
    Uncle Wang, Aunt Ma,
    Military families line up in rows.
    Women and students line up in rows,
    Saluting and shouting slogans,
    The village chief runs ahead,
    Shouldering the burdens right away.
    A basket of pork is cut off,
    A big pole-load of white flour is donated,
    A stack of bills is counted,
    Along with cabbage and vermicelli.
　
    Uncle Zhang, Sister-in-law Li,
    You sent your son to join the army,
    You persuaded your husband to enlist,
    Protecting our border region is meritorious;
    If you don't want gifts, who will?
    This isn't like giving gifts in the past,
    This is our collective heart!
    The military families say with smiling faces,
    Faces full of smiles, faces glowing red,
    And they embrace the gifts as they go back.
　
    Glorious plaques are hung on the doors,
    Like a peony blooming in front of the door,
    Like a red flag waving in front of the door.
    Glorious plaques are hung in every village,
    Like flowers blooming everywhere,
    Like red flags flying all over the sky.

　　拥护军属（歌谣）
    李帆作
    锣鼓敲，秧歌跳，
    拥护军属好热闹，
    背的口袋担的挑，
    一伙子男女过来了。
    张大叔请来了，
    又请来李四嫂，
    王大伯、马二婶，
    军属排成一条条。
    妇女学生排成排，
    举行敬礼喊口号，
    村长就上前边跑，
    担子就往面前挑。
    猪肉割了一篮子，
    白面拥护一大挑，
    票子数了一搭子，
    外带白菜和粉条。
　
    张大叔、李四嫂，
    你送儿子去参军，
    你劝丈夫把名报，
    保卫咱边区有功劳；
    你不要礼物谁来要？
    这不是往年送人情，
    这是咱群众心一条！
    说的军属们满脸的笑，
    满脸红光满脸笑，
    就把礼物往回抱。
　
    光荣的牌牌门上挂，
    又像是一朵牡丹花门前开，
    又像是一杆红旗门前飘。
    光荣的牌牌村村挂，
    又像是鲜花遍地开，
    又像是红旗满天飘。
