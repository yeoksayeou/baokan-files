(This article was transmitted by our office in Weixian on the 27th) Daming and Huguanzhuang villages, Linqing mobilized the masses to use the fruits of the struggle they obtained to develop sideline production, laying the foundation for the production movement. Linqing achieved "the tillers have their land" through the rent reduction movement. Impoverished farmers obtained land, but still lacked farming tools and fertilizers. To solve the difficulties of impoverished farmers in getting rich and in spring plowing, sideline production must be carried out, using the fruits of the struggle as capital to find a way out in production. After the end of the rent reduction movement in Daming Village, sideline production was immediately carried out. The village has a total of six cotton spinning groups, with 94 people, who can earn more than 100 yuan per day. Twelve towel machines, with more than ten people, can earn 10,000 yuan. Six steamed bun workshops with 22 people earn 1,700 yuan. Five flour mills, with 30 people, earn 5,500 yuan. One cotton ginning bow, with four people, earns 1,700 yuan. Eight cotton gins with 27 people earn 10,800 yuan. Daming's sideline production earns more than 50,000 yuan per day, enough to buy a draft cattle.
