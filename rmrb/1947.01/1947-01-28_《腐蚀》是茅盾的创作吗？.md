    Is "Corrosion" a creation of Mao Dun?
    Recently, I saw in the newspaper that Mao Dun's "Corrosion" is about to be published. I have read this book twice (bought from Central Hebei), but I always have a question I can't figure out. At the beginning of the book, Mr. Mao Dun said: "This collection of discontinuous and incomplete diaries was discovered in a public air-raid shelter in the wartime capital..." It can be seen that this book is definitely not his creation, but why is it said to be written by Mao Dun on the cover? Reader Ming Xu
    Answer
    Literary works have various forms. "Corrosion" written by Mao Dun is a full-length novel, expressed in the form of a diary. The advantage of this form is that the author uses a first-person narrative method to make the reader feel more intimate and realistic. In the past, many famous works were written in this form, such as the Soviet novel "Gray Horse" and Mr. Lu Xun's short story "A Madman's Diary". The statement "discovered in a public air-raid shelter in the wartime capital..." is not necessarily a fact; it is not a true story, but it is written to make it feel more real.

    《腐蚀》是茅盾的创作吗？
    近见报上刊登茅盾的《腐蚀》快出版，这书我已看了两遍（从冀中买来的），但老有个问题想不通，就是茅盾先生在书的开头说：“这一束断续不全的日记，发现于陪都某公共防空洞……”可见这本书，决不是他的创作，但为何书面上说是茅盾著呢？              读者明煦
    答
    文学作品有各种形式，茅盾著的《腐蚀》是一部长篇小说，是用日记的形式表现的，这个形式的好处，是作者用自述的方法以达到使读者读了感到更亲切、逼真，过去有不少名著都是用这种形式写的，如苏联小说《灰色马》，我国鲁迅先生的短篇小说《狂人日记》等。所谓“发现于陪都某公共防空洞……”者，并不一定是事实，并非真其事，只是写得更令人有真实之感而已。
