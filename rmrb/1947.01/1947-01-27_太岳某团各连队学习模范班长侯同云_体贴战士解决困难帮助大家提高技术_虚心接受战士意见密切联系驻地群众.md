[This dispatch from our Taiyue office on the 26th] The leadership methods of Hou Tongyun, a model squad leader of a certain regiment, have aroused praise and learning in various companies.

The characteristic of Hou Tongyun's leadership method is, first of all, being considerate of soldiers and solving difficulties. For example, if soldiers have difficulties in learning, he uses his own money to buy materials for everyone to study. Another time, they were to move out before dawn. Hou Tongyun saw that everyone was very tired, so he and the deputy squad leader quietly got up, cooked the meal, and then woke everyone up. When everyone got up, they were still busy looking for firewood and pots to cook, but then they found out that the meal was already cooked, and they were all very moved. Hou Tongyun is even more concerned about the daily lives of new soldiers and liberated soldiers. The new soldier Zhang Yonghai said, "I really don't want to leave Squad Leader Hou. Even my own brother at home wouldn't be this kind."

Secondly, Hou Tongyun can humbly accept the opinions of soldiers and improve his own leadership methods. Hou Tongyun's squad often holds meetings to discuss the work in the squad, and he implements the opinions raised by the soldiers the next day. He has many ways to reform soldiers. For example, the veteran soldier Duan Xinnian couldn't stay in any of the squads he was assigned to, so he was finally transferred to his squad for reformation. Hou Tongyun first held a welcome meeting. At the meeting, he said, "My ability is poor. Our squad has added an old comrade, and we will definitely do better in the future." Other soldiers also said, "Yes, yes, Comrade Duan will help us more." Duan Xinnian was very happy to hear this. Hou Tongyun consulted him on everything, praised his good points in front of everyone, and individually criticized and corrected his mistakes, which quickly made Duan Xinnian a good comrade in a very short period of time.

Also, Hou Tongyun is good at leading martial arts training. He often said to the soldiers, "If we don't quickly improve our skills, how can we complete the combat missions?" He uses every spare moment to practice hard. For example, after returning from drill and resting for a while, he asks, "Is everyone tired?" As he says this, he starts practicing martial arts himself, and everyone follows along, talking and laughing while practicing together. Therefore, the squad's skills have been quickly improved, and grenade throwing has improved from 30 meters to 36 meters. During the Hongdong battle, Hou Tongyun's squad was the ladder team. Hou Tongyun first looked at the terrain and led everyone to study and discuss it. They first practiced setting up the ladder in the town, which boosted everyone's confidence. During the battle, the enemy's firepower was very dense, so he encouraged everyone to set it up quickly. After it was set up, he immediately followed the assault team into the city to fight. Five people captured twenty-four enemies.

Hou Tongyun's squad strictly abides by the policy on prisoners of war, explaining to the prisoners in various ways, so that the prisoners quickly understand our army. When Hongdong was liberated, Hou Tongyun gave one of his own clothes to a naked prisoner to wear.

Hou Tongyun's squad has a close relationship with the masses. When they lived in Jiaodi Village, Yicheng, they often carried water for the landlord, Mother Xue. Therefore, Mother Xue treated them like her own sons. Once, Mother Xue saw that the cotton in the shirt worn by soldier Dong Wenbin was uneven, and she insisted on taking it apart and remaking it, and adding some cotton.

    体贴战士解决困难帮助大家提高技术
    虚心接受战士意见密切联系驻地群众
    【本报太岳二十六日电】某团模范班长侯同云的领导方法，已引起各个连队的称赞与学习。
    侯同云领导方法的特点首先是体贴战士，解决困难，如战士学习上有困难，就将自己的钱买材料供大家学习。又有一次天明前要出动，侯同云看大家都很疲乏，就和副班长悄悄起来把饭做好再叫醒大家，大家起来后还忙着寻柴找锅作饭，到后来知道饭已做好，都很感动。侯同云对新战士和被解放战士的日常生活更为关心，新战士张永海说：“我真不愿离开侯班长，家里的亲哥也不会像这样亲。”
    其次，侯同云能虚心接受战士的意见，改进自己的领导方法。侯同云班经常开会讨论班里工作，战士们提出的意见他第二天就实行起来。他改造战士的办法很多，如老战士段新年调到各班都停不住，最后调到他班来改造，侯同云首先召开欢迎会，他在会上说：“我能力差，咱们班内添了个老同志，今后一定会搞的更好。”别的战士也都说：“对，对，段同志多帮助咱们。”段新年听了很高兴。侯同云遇事都征求他的意见，把他的好处在大家面前表扬，错处就个别批评纠正，在很短时间内就使段新年成为一个好同志了。
    还有，侯同云善于领导练武，他时常对战士们说：“如果不赶快提高技术，怎样完成战斗任务呢？”他利用每一空隙时间苦练，如出操回来休息一回后就问：“大家累不累？”说着自己就先练起武来，大家也跟着在一块说说笑笑练起来，因此该班的技术很快得到提高，投弹从三十公尺进步到三十六公尺。洪洞战斗时，侯同云班是搭梯组，侯同云先看好地形，领导大家研究讨论，先在城关试搭了一次，提高了大家信心。在战斗时，敌人火力很密他就鼓动大家快搭，搭好后又立即随突击队进城战斗，五个人就俘虏了二十四个敌人。
    侯同云班严守俘虏政策，给俘虏多方解释，使俘虏很快的了解我军。洪洞解放时，侯同云将自己的一件衣服送给一个赤身的俘虏穿。
    侯同云班和群众有亲密的关系，他们住在翼城交底村时，常给房东薛老婆担水，因此薛老婆待他们像待自己的儿子一样。有一次薛老婆看到战士董文彬穿的上衣棉花不匀，一定要给他拆开另作，还给添些棉花。
