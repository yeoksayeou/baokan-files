(Delayed) Taiyue, 13th. After setbacks in their offensive at Fenyang and Xiaoyi, the 217th and 219th Regiments of the 73rd Division of Yan's army in southern Shanxi, along with the 1st Regiment of the 44th Division, retreated to Pingyao and Jiexiu. On the 4th, they advanced south to Fujiatan in Lingshi, and on the 5th, they occupied places like Nanguan Town, attempting to control the Lingshi-Huoxian section of the Tongpu Railway, thus dividing the Taiyue and Lvliang liberated areas. They then planned to advance on Fenxi to contain the Eighth Route Army in Lvliang, in order to relieve the Chiang army which was being passively beaten in the southern Lvliang front.
