    The Entire Staff of This Newspaper and Its Branch Offices
    Tensely Study and Improve Their Work
    [This Newspaper] Since the New Year, this newspaper and the Xinhua branch offices have been filled with a tense and active atmosphere. This is the result of the "Promote Strengths" work summary and personal review initiated at the end of last year, and the study of the five major documents (Chairman Mao's New Year's Message, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's New Year's Day broadcast, Comrade Bo Yibo's New Year's message, the New Year's Day editorial of the Liberation Daily, and Comrade Lu Dingyi's explanation of international issues) at the beginning of this year. After mid-December last year, all departments conducted work summaries, followed by personal reviews. First, they affirmed their progress and strengths over the past year, and then formulated methods to overcome shortcomings and improve further. They shared their thoughts and provided suggestions for improvement in group meetings. On this basis, work models for each department were selected, with the criteria being "actively working, diligently studying, and uniting and helping each other," and the spirit being to promote one's skills, without setting overly high standards. Finally, thirty-one models were selected from among the workers and miscellaneous staff and were solemnly commended and rewarded on the night before New Year's Eve. At the beginning of this year, the five major documents were successively received, and in-depth study and discussion were immediately launched. The editorial department of this newspaper, the branch offices, and the research office first engaged in personal in-depth reading and informal discussions, and then conducted collective discussions. The business department and the telecommunications section conducted collective reading, studying in sections, and comrades with stronger comprehension abilities helped those with weaker comprehension abilities. During the study, everyone further recognized the reactionary essence of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, shattered peaceful illusions, and were filled with infinite confidence in the victorious future of the patriotic self-defense war and the new high tide of the national democratic movement. All departments also combined political study with professional study. Comrades in the business department studied the supply system, abacus calculation, and accounting. Many comrades in the telecommunications section studied copying English newspapers and typing. The editorial department, branch offices, and research office respectively studied various practical issues in military affairs, local work, and international and domestic current events, as well as news writing and editing techniques. The telecommunications section is now able to directly receive TASS broadcasts. Through the joint efforts of the editorial department and the printing factory, the process of editing and printing the newspaper has been advanced by one day. The business department has significantly improved the food under the same supply standards. The various materials supplied by the research office have been praised by readers. The branch offices grasp the time to edit and supply manuscripts to the newspaper, the Handan Broadcasting Station, and Yan'an, all of which have been greatly improved. The "Internal Life" wall newspaper played a promoting role in this movement. It commends models, exchanges experiences, and organizes study, becoming a capable assistant to the leadership. Now, all comrades in the company are full of vigor and are prepared to adapt to the changes in the situation and further improve the work of each department.

    本报及总分社全体人员
    紧张学习改进工作
    【本报讯】新年以后，本报及新华总分社充满紧张活跃的气象，这是去年岁终发起“发扬优点”的工作总结与个人回顾和今年年初学习五大文件（毛主席新年祝词、朱总司令元旦广播，薄一波同志新年献词，解放日报元旦社论和陆定一同志关于国际问题解释）的结果。去年十二月中旬以后，各部门都进行了工作总结，接着进行个人回顾，首先肯定一年来自己的进步和优点，并订出克服缺点、提高一步的方法，在小组会上彼此谈心，互相提供改进意见。在这个基础上评选了各部门的工作模范，其标准是“积极工作，努力学习、团结互助”，其精神是发扬一技之长，条件不应过高。最后在工杂人员中，选出卅一位模范，在除夕前一夜进行了隆重的表扬和奖励。今年年初，陆续收到五大文件，当即展开深入的学习和讨论，本报编辑部，总分社和研究室首先个人精读、漫谈，然后进行集体讨论，经理部和电务科则进行集体阅读，分段研究并由理解能力较高的同志帮助理解能力较差的同志。在学习中大家进一步认识了美帝国主义和蒋介石的反动本质，粉碎了和平幻想，对爱国自卫战争，及全国民主运动新高潮的胜利前途充满了无限的信心。各部门并结合政治学习展开业务学习，经理部同志们学习供给制度、珠算和账目，电务科许多同志学习抄英文报和打字，编辑部总分社和研究室分别学习军事、地方工作及国际国内时事中的各种实际问题以及新闻写作和编辑技术。电务科已能直接抄收塔斯社广播，报纸在编辑部和印刷厂共同努力之下，将编印过程提早了一天。经理部则使伙食在同一供给标准下获得显著的改善。研究室所供给的各种资料，获得读者称赞。总分社掌握时间随到随编，供给报纸、邯郸广播电台及延安的稿件，均有不少改进。《社内生活》壁报在这一运动中起了推动作用，它表扬模范，交流经验组织学习，成为领导上得力的助手。现在全社同志充满着蓬勃的朝气，准备适应着形势的变化，将各部门工作提高一步。
