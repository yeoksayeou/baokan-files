　　Protest American Military Atrocities and Support Patriotic Movement
    Taihang Literary Federation Initiates Signature Campaign
    [Report from Changzhi on the 17th by our newspaper] The Taihang District Cultural Federation, along with writer Gao Muhong, poet Gang Fu, and others, have recently initiated a signature campaign to protest the rape of a Peking University female student by American soldiers and to support the national student patriotic movement. The Federation also authored an article titled "Supporting the National Student Patriotic Struggle," stating: "The Peking incident is not just an insult and injury to Ms. Shen, but to the entire cultural and educational circles of our country, to our sacred Chinese nation. This is the inevitable result of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country. The American reactionaries regard our country as their colony. If our sacred territory can be garrisoned by their troops at will, then our people can also be enslaved and insulted by them at will. Just as the 'December 9th' movement became a bugle call for national salvation, the national student patriotic struggle initiated by Peking students this time is also a new signal for the people of our country to rise up and move forward. We believe that, like the patriotic self-defense war in the liberated areas, the national student patriotic movement for independence and freedom will surely be victorious. We are determined to support this movement with all our heart and strength. American troops get out of China!"
    [Report from Taiyue on the 17th] All circles in Taiyue held a meeting on the 16th to commemorate the first anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference's resolution on the truce agreement and to protest American military atrocities. More than a thousand people attended, all clenching their fists in anger and seething with emotion. Yang Shaojun, a liberated woman, was so enraged when she saw the wall newspaper describing the bestial acts of American soldiers raping female students in Peking that she jumped up and said, "The foreign devils dare to insult our women like this, get back to America!" A primary school student, Wang Xiaosui, cursed from the side, "Chiang Kai-shek, you invited your foreign grandfathers and did this bastard thing, get the hell out of here!" During the meeting, representatives of mass organizations in Taiyue suggested that the signing of the Chiang-American commercial terms on November 4th last year was an even greater humiliation than Yuan Shikai's Twenty-One Demands. They proposed that this day be designated as a new National Humiliation Memorial Day, which was greeted with loud cheers of approval. Guo Huarong, a representative of women from Dongguan, Yangcheng, said with grief and indignation: "The women of Yangcheng have been humiliated, we must make the American troops get out! First, we women must support the front line and defeat Chiang Kai-shek, the American son, and second, we will not buy any American goods, we will spin, weave, and wear our own clothes." Finally, a resolution was passed to designate November 4th as the new National Humiliation Memorial Day and a telegram was sent to patriotic students nationwide.

　　抗议美军暴行声援爱国运动
    太行文联发起签名运动
    【本报长治十七日电】太行区文化界联合会及作家高沐鸿、诗人冈夫等，顷发起抗议美军强奸北大女生事件与声援全国学生爱国运动的签名运动。该会并以《声援全国学生爱国斗争》为题著文称：“北平事件，被侮辱与损害者不仅是沈女士，而是我全国文化教育界，是我神圣的中华民族。这是蒋介石卖国的必然结果。美国反动派视我国为其殖民地，神圣国土既任可其驻兵，人民自亦可任彼奴役与侮辱。正如‘一二·九’成为救亡的号角一样，此次首由北平学生发动的全国学生爱国斗争也是我全国人民奋起前进的新信号。我们相信：和解放区的爱国自卫战争一样，全国学生为争独立与自由的爱国运动也一定胜利。我们决以全心全力支持这一运动。美军滚出中国去！
    【太岳十七日电】太岳各界于十六日举行政协决议停战协订周年纪念、抗议美军暴行大会，到会千余人个个怒目挥拳，情绪激愤，翻身妇女杨少俊，看到壁报上美军在北平奸淫女生的兽行时，气得跳着说：“洋鬼子敢对我们妇女这样污辱，快滚回美国去！”小学生王小随在一旁大骂：“蒋介石你请来了你的洋爷爷，干这混蛋事，滚你妈的蛋吧！”开会时，太岳群众团体代表提出建议：去年十一月四日蒋美商业条件的签订，比袁世凯的卖国二十一条的耻辱还大，把这天作为新的国耻纪念日，全场高呼响应。阳城东关妇女代表郭花荣悲愤的说：“咱们阳城妇女耻辱，要使美军滚出去！咱们妇女第一要支援前线把美国的儿子蒋介石打垮，第二不买一点美国货，自纺自织自穿。”最后通过十一月四日为新国耻纪念日及致全国爱国同学电。
