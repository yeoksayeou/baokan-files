Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 30th: This morning at 8:00 AM, Chiang Kai-shek's 123rd Brigade and 48th Brigade simultaneously launched an attack on the Guanzhong Sub-region of our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region from the east and west. Since last month, the enemy's preparations to attack our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and their harassment on the border lines have not ceased. Their repeated invasions have been repelled by our army. Now that Chiang's "National Assembly" has just ended with fanfare, they are launching a large-scale offensive against our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.

　　陕甘宁蒋军两个旅
    分路犯我关中分区
    【新华社延安十二月三十日电】今（三十日）晨八时蒋介石一二三旅、四八旅自东西两面开始向我陕甘宁边区关中分区同时进攻。自上月以来，敌人进攻我陕甘宁边区之准备与在边沿线上骚扰，迄未停止。其历次侵犯，均经我军击退，现蒋记“国大”甫告锣鼓收场，又向我陕甘宁边区大举进攻。
