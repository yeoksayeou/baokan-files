　　The "Quantou Troops" were formed automatically by the people after the enemy occupied Heze and Dongming. Squad Leader Li Hongxuan told me: "When the Japanese devils were here, we would look up and see two or three guard towers, and we defeated them all; now fighting old Chiang is no problem." On October 9th, a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Army attempted to wipe out the Quantou Troops in one fell swoop. The enemy used fierce artillery fire to bombard Zhulou Street. Deputy Squad Leader Yu Defa and Squad Leader Zhang Yongxin, who were guarding the south gate, resisted for two hours with two machine guns. After the battle, the enemy dragged back eight corpses in a panic. The south side of Xinzhuang is a main road. On the 22nd, Chiang's army was walking there with six horses and two mules. Comrade Hou led a platoon to rush up, and nine soldiers of the Fifth Army and six animals loaded with goods were captured. Wang Caiqing, the deputy head of the puppet Fifth District "Joint Defense Team," gathered more than 300 people. On the morning of November 28th, they swaggered across the Three Great Bridges (twelve li west of Heze City). As soon as they arrived at Geng Hai, four of them were knocked down by the Quantou Troops ambushed in the street. The second time the enemy counterattacked, our twelve men forced seventy or eighty "cowards" to release their sheep, and groups of them were driven into the river up to their waists.
　　The soldiers of the Quantou Troops are all simple farmers from the countryside, and soldiers who put down their guns and picked up hoes after the ceasefire. Their connection with the masses cannot be severed by anyone. While fighting guerrillas, they also launched a wave of doing chores for the masses. Whenever they arrived in a place, they would fetch water, haul manure, and do all kinds of work for the people. The masses loved them especially. Old ladies often sent them things to eat, and always asked them to stay: "Stay a few more days." They also organized propaganda teams to go to the villages to tell the folks about current affairs, talk about victory, and expose the enemy's rumors. Under the enemy's frantic oppression, the Quantou Troops have become the backing of the Nan-Hua people.

　　南华人民的靠山
    野风
    “圈头部队”是在敌人占领荷泽、东明后，人民自动成立起来的。机枪班长李鸿轩告诉我说：“鬼子在时，一抬头就看见两三个岗楼子，那都叫咱斗败了；现在打老蒋才不成问题呢。”十月九日，蒋六十八军一个营，企图一鼓消灭圈头部队。敌人用猛烈炮火向朱楼街里轰击，守南门的一排副于得法、一班长张永信，抱着两挺机枪，一直抵抗了两个钟头。战斗结束后，敌人狼狈的拖回去八具死尸。靠新庄南地是一条大道，二十二日，蒋军在那里走着六匹马，两头骡子。侯同志带着一个排冲上去，九个第五军的士兵和六匹满载物品的牲口作了俘虏。伪五区副“联防队”头子王彩庆集合了三百余人，于十一月二十八日晨，  大摇大摆的走过三大桥（荷泽城西十二里），刚到耿海，就被预伏街里的圈头部队揍倒了四个。第二次敌人反冲上来了，我们十二个男士，又迫使七八十个“熊包”放了羊，一群群的被赶到了水达腰深的河里去。
    圈头部队的战士，都是来自农村中的朴实农民，和停战后放下枪杆拿起锄头的军人，他们与群众的联系是谁也割不断的。在打游击当中，同时展开了给群众做活的热潮。每到一地，就给老百姓打水、出粪、啥活都干。群众就格外的爱护他们，老大娘经常给送东西吃，临走总留他们：“再住几天吧。”他们又组织了宣传小组，到各村给老乡讲时事，谈胜利，揭破了敌人的谣言。在敌人的疯狂压榨下，圈头部队已成为南华人民的靠山。
