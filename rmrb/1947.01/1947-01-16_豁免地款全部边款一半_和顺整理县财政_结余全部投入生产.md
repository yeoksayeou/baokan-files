　　[This dispatch from our Changzhi office on the 14th] The Heshun County government is actively consolidating county finances to reduce the burden on the people. As a result of the clearing of local finances and the county treasury, at the end of 1946, the local funds inventory still had more than 4.98 million yuan. The profits from public production enterprises and the income from local public property totaled more than 4.09 million yuan in the past year. This year's budget for such public property and public enterprise income is 3.5 million yuan. These three items alone amount to more than 12.57 million yuan. Therefore, the county government decided to reduce the 7 million yuan of border region unified progressive tax recently allocated to the county by half, which would be covered by the income from county-run public enterprise production. The local surcharges are also completely exempted, greatly reducing the burden on the people. It was also decided to invest all the surplus after covering the border region funds in production to increase income. At the same time, efforts should be made to practice thrift, tighten local expenditures, and strive to reduce or exempt all local and part of the border region grain that the people should bear in the autumn harvest this year, so that the liberated people of the county can quickly realize the goal of "cultivating three and having a surplus of one" and become rich in the short term. The local grain that the county should have collected during the autumn harvest last year has been completely exempted. The county has reduced the burden on the people by 28.9% within a year.

　　豁免地款全部边款一半
    和顺整理县财政
    结余全部投入生产
    【本报长治十四日电】和顺县府积极整理县财政，减轻人民负担。地方财政及县金库清理结果，四六年底地方款库存尚有四百九十八万余元，一年来公营生产事业利得及地方公产收入等项共四百零九万余元，此种公产及公营事业收入本年预算为三百五十万元，仅此三项即为一千二百五十七万余元。因此县府决定将最近分派该县之边区统累税款七百万元减免一半，由县公营事业生产收入垫付，地方附加亦全部豁免，大大减轻人民负担。并决定将垫付边区款后之结余全部投入生产，增加收入。同时厉行节约，紧缩地方开支，争取减免今年秋屯人民应负担之全部地方与部分边区粮，使该县翻身人民能于短期内迅速实现耕三余一，发家致富。该县去年秋屯时应征地方粮已全部豁免，一年内该县共减轻人民负担百分之二十八点九。
