　　Yuan Dynasty Landlords Determined to Transform
    Efforts in Production and Active War Preparation
    [Report from Weixian on the 17th of this month] After the land reform in Yuan Dynasty, the landlords and peasants united to actively produce and resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime. Gao He-shun and his son, landlords in Gao Village, District Five, immediately got up to collect manure, carry water, and grind flour. Wang Wu-shen, a landlord in Dajiang, not only actively engaged in production but also prepared for war, burying public grain very well. When stretcher-bearers were needed, he eagerly volunteered. The village cadre said, "It's not your shift yet!" He said to the masses, "I am determined to transform myself properly and compete with other landlords to see who is a model worker." Song Jiu-da, a landlord in Dongsu Village, swore to the masses, "I am determined to follow everyone and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end. If the Chiang army captures me, I will die rather than reveal the village cadres and public grain. If I am double-minded, I am willing to be punished by the law." Landlord Sun Feng-ling also expressed his attitude to the masses, saying, "I will definitely unite well with the masses in the whole village and eliminate the Chiang soldiers who kill the people." Ma Xuan-kui, a landlord who had fled from Shanyue Village, heard that the landlords at home were doing very well, that the democratic government guaranteed the safety of life and property, and was quite moved. He voluntarily returned to the village and swore to the masses: "I guarantee not to do bad things and to work in peace." Now, the fugitive landlords in the district are returning to the village one after another, working hard in production.

　　元朝地主决心转变
    努力生产积极备战
    【本报威县十七日电】元朝在土地改革后，地主和农民团结起来，积极生产，坚决反对蒋伪。五区高庄地主高河顺父子不明即起来拾粪、担水、磨粉。大江地主王五申一面积极生产，一面备战，把公粮埋藏的很好，出担架时他争着要去，村干说：“该不着你的班呢！”他对群众说：“我决心转变好好的，和别的地主比赛，看谁是工作模范。”东苏村地主宋九达向群众宣誓说：“我坚决跟着大家和老蒋拚到底，蒋军万一捉住我，誓死不能说出村干和公粮，我如有三心二意，愿受法律制裁。”地主孙凤岭也向群众表明态度，他说：“我一定和全村群众好好团结，消灭杀害老百姓的蒋军。”山岳村逃出去的地主马玄魁听见在家地主过得都很好，民主政府保障生命财产的安全，颇受感动，自动回村，向群众宣誓：“保证不作坏事，安心生产。”现该区逃亡地主，纷纷回村，努力生产。
