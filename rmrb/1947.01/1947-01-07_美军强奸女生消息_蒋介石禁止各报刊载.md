    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 3rd: Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed the Mayor of Beiping to suppress any news regarding the Beiping American soldier rape case until after an "official investigation." According to the Beiping Xinmin Daily, when the news was sent to various newspaper offices by the Yaguang News Agency, the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau, in the name of "promoting friendly relations," ordered all newspapers to prohibit the publication of this news. However, because some newspapers had already printed the news when they received the order, the citizens of Beiping learned of this atrocity committed by American soldiers.

    美军强奸女生消息
    蒋介石禁止各报刊载
    【新华社延安四日电】据美联社南京三日电：蒋介石已电令北平市长关于北平美军强奸事件在“官方调查”前，任何消息均予压制。按该事件初发生时，据北平新民报载称：该消息经亚光通讯社发稿送至各报馆时，平市富局即以“敦睦邦交”名义，命令禁止各报刊布此项消息，但因若干报纸在接获命令时已行印出，故平市市民获悉是项美军暴行。
