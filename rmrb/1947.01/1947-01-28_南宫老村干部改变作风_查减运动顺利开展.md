    Old Village Cadres in Nangong Change Their Style
    Rent Reduction Movement Progresses Smoothly
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Wei County, 26th] Old village cadres in the fifth district of Nangong have changed their style of being detached from the masses, regained the support of the masses, and promoted the development of the rent reduction movement. Village cadres in fifteen villages, including Xu Da and Nanjiacheng in the fifth district, first conducted self-criticism and mutual criticism, and then apologized and confessed to the masses. The masses reflected: "Village cadres have not had it easy these past few years of work. Confessing their mistakes is enough. Let's concentrate our efforts on the landlords." In these villages, the majority of poor peasants have been organized, with some achieving full family membership. Some villages have already elected representatives for emancipation. Some villages, after the masses poured out their grievances, discovered new activists during the process, who were then elected as representatives, which was better than electing them without the grievance sessions. In villages like Fengcun and Xu Da, representatives were elected without grievance sessions, and as a result, the representatives were not active and were replaced by the masses. According to statistics from the fifteen villages, two-thirds of the elected representatives for emancipation are old village cadres, and there are also many women representatives, proving that the relationship between the old village cadres and the masses has improved, and attention has been paid to mobilizing women in the movement. Currently, the masses in six villages, including Nanfengjia and Fengcun, have raised their awareness through group grievance sessions and have launched struggles against local bullies and landlords.

    南宫老村干部改变作风
    查减运动顺利开展
    【本报威县廿六日电】南宫五区老村干转变脱离群众作风，重新得到群众拥护推动了查减运动的开展。五区徐达、南贾城等十五个村村干部，首先进行了自我检查和互相检查，然后又向群众道歉坦白。群众反映：“村干办公这几年，也不容易，坦白认错就完了，集中力量对地主吧。”以上这些村庄中，贫农大部组织起来，有的做到全家入会，有的村庄已选出翻身代表。有的村庄经过群众诉苦，在诉苦中发现新的积极分子，选为代表，比不经诉苦选举的好。冯村、徐达等村未经诉苦即选举代表，结果代表不积极，又被群众撤换了。按十五个村统计，选出的翻身代表三分之二是老村干，并有很多妇女代表，证明了老村干与群众关系已经改善，并在运动中，注意发动妇女。目前南冯家、冯村等六村群众，经过小组诉苦，提高了觉悟，已经对恶霸地主开展了斗争。
