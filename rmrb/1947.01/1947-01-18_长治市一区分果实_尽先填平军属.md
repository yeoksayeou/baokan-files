　　Changzhi City's First District Distributes Fruits of Victory
　　Prioritizing Military Dependents
　　[Report from our Changzhi City correspondent] Citizens of the First District are competing to help solve the difficulties of military dependents during the leveling and replenishment campaign. At the end of last year, the district office convened a meeting of the heads of civil education from various streets to study "Thoroughly helping solve the difficulties of military dependents and establishing their homes is practical support for the frontline work." Through the mobilization of activists in various streets, military dependents were included in the deliberation of fruit distribution, their difficulties were raised, and efforts were made to fill their gaps first. Of the district's ninety-nine new and old military dependents, excluding ten wealthy peasant households, most received sufficient housing and land. A total of ninety-four rooms, one hundred and fourteen mu of land, over 4.8 million yuan (currency not specified), over six hundred pieces of clothing, over three hundred pieces of furniture, and over one hundred and forty shi of grain were distributed. Impoverished citizens have all been raised above the poverty line. Gao Xiang, a military dependent in Qingzhen Street, received 76,000 Jicha banknotes and, with the help of the masses, engaged in production, earning an additional dividend of 34,000 yuan. His family's living standards have exceeded four times that before liberation, and the whole family is exceptionally happy. At a symposium for military dependents, old military dependent Cheng Wenming couldn't close his mouth with joy, saying that the government is really good to us, giving us honorary plaques, inviting us to meals, and cadres even pay us New Year visits, and the masses also think highly of us. He recalled the suffering caused by the Kuomintang's unresisted retreat and loss of Changzhi during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and indignantly said: "After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek brought in American imperialism, selling out the country on the one hand and oppressing the people on the other, not allowing the people to stand up. He said with full confidence: "I, an old man, will definitely write a letter to tell my children to fight hard to defeat the Chiang-American reactionaries and defend our good life."

　　长治市一区分果实
    尽先填平军属
    【本报长治市讯】一区市民，在填平补齐运动中，争先帮助解决军属困难。区署于去年底召开各街民教主任研究“彻底帮助解决军属困难建立家务，就是实际支援前线工作”。通过各街积极分子动员，在分配果实中，吸收军属参加评议，提出困难，尽先填平他们的窟窿。全区九十九户新老军属，除十户富农外。大部分得足够房地。共分得房屋九十四间，地一百一十四亩，洋四百八十余万元，衣服六百余件，家具三百多件，粮食一百四十余石。赤贫市民已全部上升。清真街军属高翔分得七万六千冀钞后，在群众帮助下进行生产，复得红利三万四千元。其家庭生活超过解放前四倍，全家异常高兴。在军属座谈会上，老军属程文明欢喜的合不住嘴，说政府对咱真好，给咱挂光荣牌，请咱吃饭，干部还给拜年，群众也高看咱。他回忆起抗战中国民党不战而溃丢掉长治所遭的苦难，愤慨的说：“蒋介石在抗战胜利后，又请来美帝国主义，一面卖国，一面压迫老百姓，不让人民翻身。他充满信心的说：“我老汉一定写信告诉俺孩子，叫他好好打垮蒋美反动派，保卫咱们的好光景。”
