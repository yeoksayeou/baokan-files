    Local Military Units Take the Initiative to Support Mass Movements
    Twelve Administrative Villages Along the Ma River in Jiyuan
    Complete Land Distribution in Ten Days Under the Cover of Fire
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Yangcheng, 23rd] Our northern Henan local military units, together with the militia of Jiyuan and Meng Counties, have been launching continuous attacks to protect the masses in twelve administrative villages along the Ma River in southeastern Jiyuan, completing land reform within ten days. To suppress the fierce flames of Chiang's puppets and support the masses' land reform movement, a certain unit of our northern Henan local military units launched a surprise attack on Suncun, a stronghold of Chiang's puppets on the border of Jiyuan and Meng Counties, on the 5th of this month, killing and wounding more than ten enemies. On the night of the 7th, they attacked the Jiang puppet Qingu stronghold, capturing 36 puppet self-defense corps members (revenge squad) and others. On the 9th, they attacked Zhaohe stronghold again, capturing six puppet self-defense corps members and wounding two. On the same night, another guerrilla force of ours raided Hongdao stronghold, capturing three enemies. This greatly boosted the morale of the masses along the Ma River, who universally threw themselves into the emancipation movement. More than 30 poor peasant households in Duancun and 80 poor peasant households in Zhongmatou Village said enthusiastically: "Whether we can be emancipated depends on this one move. Let's do it!" The enemies in the Five Cao and Pangtai strongholds attempted to come out and sabotage the mass movement, but they were all repelled by our local military units and militia. The masses in Duancun, Nanguanzhuang and other villages held meetings as usual amidst the sounds of gunfire, launching a general reckoning against the despotic landlords. From the beginning of this month to the middle of the month, in just ten short days, the twelve administrative villages along the Ma River in Jiyuan, including Guanzhuang, Duancun, Xiguolu, Lilin, Zhongmatou, and Nanying, have all realized "land to the tillers." Celebration rallies for emancipation have been held one after another, and they have now entered the stage of organizing joint village defense and armed protection of the land.
