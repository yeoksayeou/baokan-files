    [This Newspaper's Frontline Dispatch from Jilu-Yu, 26th] A frontline reporter's account of the situation after the Eighth Route Army recovered Dingtao City stated: Since the Eighth Route Army, after completing the task of annihilating Chiang's direct line 3rd Division (10th Army) on September 12th of last year, voluntarily withdrew from Dingtao City, the city was occupied by Chiang's 5th Army and other units, later entrenched by the pseudo-security regiment of Shi Fuqi. The traitor Shi carried out inhuman massacres, rapes, and robberies against the broad masses of the people in Dingtao, and was particularly cruel to the families of anti-Japanese soldiers. In the villages near the city gate alone, dozens of anti-Japanese family members were tortured and killed, and no young woman was spared from rape. The people hated Chiang and his puppets to the bone. After Dingtao City was liberated again, the local people were overjoyed to hear that Shi Fuqi had been killed by our army. An old woman grabbed the Eighth Route Army soldier's sleeve and said, "Shi Fuqi's evil deeds are countless, and the Eighth Route Army has eliminated the scourge for the people, truly the savior of the common people." Within hours of the city's recapture, order was restored, and merchants resumed business. Now, the democratic government is actively providing relief to the compatriots who have suffered.
    [This Newspaper's Frontline Dispatch from Jilu-Yu, 27th] Our reporter Wu Xiang reported on the situation when the Eighth Route Army recovered Xitai Village in Dingtao: Before the battle, Chiang's troops tightly closed the village gates, forcing all residents to repair fortifications for them; after the battle began, they collectively imprisoned them. In one small house, more than forty people were confined, not even allowed to go out to relieve themselves. Old man Hao Qinghai, unable to endure the hunger, asked to go home to get some cornbread, but was stabbed through the chest. Eleven people were killed after being falsely accused of being Eighth Route Army spies, and eight were wounded. After the Eighth Route Army broke into the northeast corner of the village, Chiang's troops still attempted to resist stubbornly, trying to burn down a row of houses to create a barrier, but fearing being swept by our fire, they forced an old woman to set the fire with bayonets. The Eighth Route Army soldiers were filled with grief and indignation, and had to fire shots into the sky, causing the old woman to retreat in fear. Chiang's troops then used bayonets to force other villagers to set the fire, eventually burning down the entire row of houses. This despicable and beastly behavior of Chiang's troops aroused even greater hatred and anger among the soldiers, and they finally annihilated all the stubborn enemies. After the troops entered the village, they first rescued the imprisoned residents, who had not had water for a day and a night, and cried to the soldiers, embracing them like relatives, recounting the atrocities of Chiang's troops. The Eighth Route Army immediately provided 200,000 yuan for relief and comfort.

    为人民复仇！
    定陶被蒋军侵占后沦为血海地狱，我军为民除害之后人民重见青天。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十六日电】前线记者报导八路军收复定陶城后的情形称：自去年九月十二日八路军于完成歼灭蒋军嫡系整三师（第十军）任务，主动撤离定陶城后，该城即为蒋军第五军等部侵占，后由伪保安团石福起盘据，石逆对定陶广大人民进行了惨无人道的屠杀、奸淫和抢劫，对待抗日军人家属尤为残酷。仅城关附近各村被虐杀之抗属即达数十人，青年妇女无一不被奸污，人民对蒋伪恨之入骨。定陶城重获解放后，当地人民听说石福起为我军击毙，人心大快，一位老太太拉着八路军战士的衣襟说：“石福起恶贯满盈，八路军为民除害，真是老百姓的救星。”该城于收复后数小时，秩序即告恢复，商民恢复营业，现民主政府正对被难同胞积极进行救济。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】本社记者吴象报导八路军收复定陶西台集时的情形称：战斗前，蒋军紧闭寨门，威逼所有居民为其抢修工事；战斗开始后，又将彼等集体囚禁，一间小屋内有关禁四十余人者，连便溺都不准外出。郝清海老汉因无法忍受饥饿，请求回家取窝窝头，竟被刺穿前胸。被诬指为八路军暗探而杀戮者共十一人，负伤者八人。八路军攻入该村东北角后，蒋军犹图顽抗，欲将一排房屋烧毁，造成隔绝地带，又恐遭我扫射，竟用刺刀逼一老太太放火。八路军战士悲痛万分，只得对天放枪，此老太太惊惧退避，蒋军又用刺刀逼其他老乡放火，终将这排房屋全部焚毁。蒋军此种卑劣兽行，激起战士们更大的仇恨与愤怒，终将顽敌全部歼灭。部队入村后，首先解救被囚居民，彼等已一天一晚没有喝水，像见到亲人似的抱着战士们哭诉蒋军暴行。八路军当以二十万元进行救济安抚。
