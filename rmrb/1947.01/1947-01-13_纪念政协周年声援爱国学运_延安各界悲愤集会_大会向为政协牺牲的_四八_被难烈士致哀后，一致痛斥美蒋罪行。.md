Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 11th: Yan'an circles held a rally yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to support the national student patriotic movement and commemorate the anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). The conference was chaired by Xie Juezai, who delivered a speech. Amidst mournful music, attendees paid respects to the "April 8th" martyrs who sacrificed for the PCC. Following this, Professor Chen Jinkun, a renowned legal scholar, delivered a speech, vehemently condemning the presence of American troops in China as a violation of international law. He stated, "Without the help of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek could not and would not dare to wage a civil war. Now, the only way out for our country and nation is for all the people to strive to realize the PCC line and the ceasefire order." Subsequently, General Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative to the PCC, and Comrade Lu Dingyi, also a CCP representative to the PCC, delivered speeches (the full texts of which will be published separately). Comrade Deng Yingchao, the CCP representative to the PCC and Vice-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas, lodged a serious protest against the atrocities of the American military on behalf of the 70 million women in the Liberated Areas. Regarding the rape of a female student at Peking University by an American soldier, she said with indignation, "This is just one of thousands of atrocities. This incident, on the surface, is an American soldier raping a female student, but in reality, it is American imperialism raping China's national dignity. This is China's shame, an insult to the dignity of the Chinese nation." Regarding the Kuomintang's convening of a bogus National Assembly, she said, "Chiang Kai-shek has completely violated the resolutions of the PCC. He thinks that by dragging the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party to participate in his bogus National Assembly, he is putting powder on his face, but in reality, he is putting ash on his own face." Following this, General Hu Jingduo, Commander of the Sixth Cavalry Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, spoke. The conference concluded with a proposal that the Border Region Government issue a decree designating November 4th as the National Humiliation Memorial Day. A telegram was also passed, stating that the people of Yan'an pledge to be the backing for students all over the country, oppose the atrocities of the American military, demand that the American military immediately withdraw from China, oppose American imperialism helping Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war, and oppose the dictatorial and traitorous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek government, and will not stop until these goals are achieved!

    【新华社延安十一日电】延安各界声援全国学生爱国运动与政协周年纪念大会，于昨日上午十时召开。大会由谢觉哉主席致词，并在哀乐声中，向为政协牺牲的“四八”被难烈士致哀后，由名法学家陈瑾琨教授讲话。陈教授痛斥美军驻华为违反国际公法，他说：“如果没有美帝国主义的帮助，蒋介石决不能也不敢进行内战。现在全国人民只有为实现政协路线与停战令奋斗，这才是我们国家民族的真正出路。”继由中共政协代表周恩来将军及中共政协代表陆定一同志讲话（原词均另文发表），中共政协代表、中国解放区妇联筹委会副主席邓颖超同志，代表解放区七千万妇女向美军暴行提出严重抗议，对于美军强奸北大女学生事，她愤慨地说：“这是千万暴行中之一，这事件表面上看来是一个美军强奸一个女生，实际上是美帝国主义强奸了中国的国格，这是中国的耻辱，是侮辱中华民族尊严的事。”对国民党召开伪国大事，她说：“蒋介石完全违背了政协决议，他以为拉走了青年党和民社党参加他的伪国大，就是在他那脸上抹上了粉，其实他是在自己脸上抹了灰。”接着由西北民主联军骑六师师长胡景铎将军讲话。大会最后建议边府明令公布订十一月四日为中国国耻纪念日。并通过通电，表示延安各界人民誓为全国各地学生后盾，反对美军暴行，要求美军立即退出中国，反对美国帝国主义帮助蒋介石打内战，反对蒋介石政府独裁卖国之罪行，不达目的决不休止！
