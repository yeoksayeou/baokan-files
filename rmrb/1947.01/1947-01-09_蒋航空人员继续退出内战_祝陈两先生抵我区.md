    Chiang's Aviation Personnel Continue to Withdraw from Civil War
    Mr. Zhu and Mr. Chen Arrive in Our Area
    [Reported by this newspaper] Kuomintang air force personnel, opposed to the civil war and the betrayal of the country, continue to flee to our liberated areas. On December 20th of last month, Zhu Ke, a maintenance mechanic, and Chen Zhenya, a communications specialist, from the 33rd Squadron of the Eighth Group of the Kuomintang Central Aviation, arrived in our area via Shanghai. This is the third group of Kuomintang anti-war air force personnel to flee to our area after Captain Liu Shanben flew his plane out of the civil war. The first group consisted of Song Zhiliang, a pilot, and Zhang Xuli, a radio operator, from the Fifth General Station of the Kuomintang Aviation in Kunming, who came to our area from Kunming on August 1st. The second group was Zuo Gao, a paratrooper (Army Assault Brigade) carefully trained by Chiang Kai-shek, who, unwilling to use American weapons to slaughter his compatriots, resolutely left the paratrooper unit and came to our area from Beiping in September. Mr. Zhu and Mr. Chen, dressed in new blue cotton-padded clothes, said that coming to the liberated area was like returning to their hometown. Chen Zhenya said: "Most of the personnel in our Aviation Eighth Group were trained during the War of Resistance. These talents were not used to fight Japan. The Eighth Group was only formally established after the victory of the War of Resistance. Isn't it very clear what this was for?" Zhu Ke cited a heartbreaking story: "In July, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Eighth Group to bomb Rugao city in the Subei Liberated Area. Many innocent and peaceful residents were killed by the bombing, and the two battalions of Kuomintang troops attacking were also blown to pieces. American bombs killed the Chinese people. This incident caused a great disturbance in the Eighth Group. Captain Liu Shanben of the same group was the first to fly his plane to Yan'an and withdraw from the civil war. Although the Kuomintang tried every means to deceive, saying that 'the gasoline ran out and he was forced to land,' most of the air force personnel were very clear-headed. Especially during the 'July 7th' and 'August 14th' Air Force Days, everyone clearly heard Liu Shanben's several speeches on the Yan'an Radio Station. His words deeply moved the air force personnel who did not want to participate in the civil war." Chen Zhenya said: "Many aviators, suffering from being unable to escape, sat next to their own radios at night, listening to the broadcasts from Yan'an and Zhangjiakou." Zhu Ke said: "In the Aviation Eighth Group, except for the fact that their bodies are Chinese, nothing is supplied by the United States. After the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce was signed, Chiang Kai-shek even wanted to sell out China's ancestors." Finally, they said: Many colleagues in the group are unwilling to rot there and are willing to come to the liberated area. They know that the liberated area is bright, so many flight crews often say: "Fly! Fly! Fly to the liberated area, then jump bravely!"

    蒋航空人员继续退出内战
    祝陈两先生抵我区
    【本报讯】反对内战，反对卖国的国民党空军人员，继续逃来我解放区。上月二十日，国民党中央航空第八大队三十三中队机务士祝克，通讯士陈振亚，已由上海辗转抵达本区，这是刘善本上尉驾机退出内战后，国民党反战空军人员逃来本区的第三批。第一批是昆明国民党航空第五总站驾驶员宋志良，无线电员章旭礼，于八月一日由昆明来到本区。第二批为蒋介石精心培养的国民党伞兵（陆军突击总队）左高，不愿用美国武器屠杀自己同胞，毅然脱离伞兵部队，于九月由北平来到本区。祝陈两先生，身着蓝色新棉衣，来解放区后，自称犹如回到了家乡。陈振亚说：“我们航空第八大队，大部人员都是抗战期间训练出来的，这些人材没有用去打日本，抗战胜利后，第八大队才正式成立，这为了什么，还不是很明白吗？”祝克举出一个痛心的故事说：“七月里蒋介石命令第八大队轰炸苏北解放区的如皋城，许多无辜的和平居民被炸死了，进攻的两营国民党军，也一同炸得血肉横飞，美国的炸弹，炸死的却是中国人民，这件事在八大队里，引起了很大的波动。该大队刘善本上尉，他首先驾机飞延安退出内战。当时国民党虽百般欺骗，说是“汽油用尽，被迫降落”，但大部空军人员脑筋却是非常清醒的，特别是“七七”和“八一四”空军节，刘善本在延安广播电台的几次讲演，大家都很清楚的听到，他的话深深的打动了不愿内战的空军人员”。陈振亚说：“许多苦于无法脱身的航空员，在夜间坐在自备的收音机旁，收听延安张家口的广播”，祝克说：“在航空第八大队里，除了肉体是中国的外，没有一件不是美国供给的。中美商约订后，蒋介石把中国的宗祖也要卖掉了。”最后他们说：大队里的许多同事，都不愿意在那里腐烂下去，都愿意来解放区，他们知道解放区才是光明，因此很多空勤人员经常这样说：“飞呀！飞呀！飞到解放区上空，就勇敢的跳罢”！
