Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 27th: According to a report from the British official news agency in London on the 25th, "Britain's concern over the continued growth of differences of opinion within China and its possible impact on relations with other major powers was expressed during a debate in the House of Lords yesterday." The debate in the British House of Lords on the 24th was the first full debate on the China issue in the British Parliament since the end of the war. Seven representatives from the Labor Party, Conservative Party, and Liberal Party spoke on the day for a duration of three hours. Lord Lindsay, a Labor Party member of the House of Lords and Master of Balliol College, Oxford University, criticized every policy of the Chinese government in his speech. He suggested sending a British representative to the capital of the CCP and consulting with the United States, the Soviet Union, and, if possible, all members of the United Nations, regarding the dangers existing in the domestic situation in China. Lord Elgin of the Conservative Party, a member of the British Trade Mission to China in 1942, said: "We agreed with the Chinese government to return British property in China that was occupied by Japan, but this has not been done." Elgin demanded that these properties be completely handed over in accordance with the treaty currently under negotiation. Lord Cranborne of the Conservative Party said that Britain's only concern was the commercial development from which both peoples could benefit. Other speakers included Tweed, a Liberal Party member, and de Winter. Finally, Solicitor General Jowitt, representing the Labor government, replied that he was surprised that the speakers had not mentioned the Three Foreign Ministers' Moscow Declaration of a year ago. He pointed out that the declaration stated that the three foreign ministers unanimously agreed on a unified and democratic China, the broad participation of democratic elements in all levels of the Chinese government, the cessation of domestic warfare, and the need for foreign countries not to interfere in China. He said: "Based on this consistent policy, Britain does not want to see China subjected to totalitarian rule imposed by any group or party. The British government welcomes the implementation of the Moscow Declaration. Regarding the broad participation of democratic elements in the National Government, Britain is not blindly following the policies of any other country." Jowitt concluded by saying: "The world will not prosper when such a large part of it is unfortunately in a state of civil war... The British government will firmly adhere to the decision not to interfere in China's internal affairs, sincerely hope that China's suffering will quickly lead to a happy outcome, and is willing to do everything in its power to help everyone achieve this happy outcome." In his speech, Jowitt also mentioned that Britain's "overall objective" in China was the same as that of the United States, namely, "to work and associate with a strong, consolidated government that can faithfully fulfill its obligations and is based on broad democratic foundations; we have no other obligations." He also expressed the need for the restoration of Sino-British trade. The debate expressed concern about the current state of Sino-British trade agreement negotiations, including British air rights in China and British property in China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: Associated Press reported on the 24th: Earl Lindsay proposed to the British House of Lords on the 23rd that Britain send a representative to Yan'an to "obtain the true facts." Lindsay told the House of Lords that he had "great contempt" for the Chiang Kai-shek government. It is reported that Earl Lindsay is the Master of Balliol College of Oxford University in Britain. In 1945, he became a member of the British House of Lords (House of Peers). His son, Professor Michael Lindsay, was a professor of physics at Yenching University in Peiping before the war. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he left Peiping and went to Yan'an via the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area. He returned to his country from Yan'an last year.

    英国关切中国局势
    主张实践莫斯科决议
    林德西提议派遣代表赴延安
    【新华社延安二十七日电】据英国官方通讯社伦敦二十五日电称：“英国对于中国国内继续增长的意见分歧、及其对其他强国关系之可能的影响所表示的关切，已于昨日上院的辩论中表示出来。”英上院二十四日之辩论，为战争结束以来英议会对中国问题之首次充分辩论。是日发言者有工党、保守党、自由党三大党代表七人，历三小时之久。工党上议员牛津大学贝利奥德学院院长林德西，发言时批评中国政府之每一政策，他建议派遣英国代表赴中共首都，并且与美苏如果可能时与一切联合国，共商关于中国国内形势所存在的危险。保守党上议员艾尔温为一九四二年英商务访华团团员，他说：“我们曾与中国政府约定发还日本侵占英国在华的财产，这件事并未做。”艾氏要求按照现在进行谈判的条约，完全交出这些财产。保守党之克兰波恩说：英国唯一的关切是两国人民都可获益的商业发展。此外发言者尚有伊德斯勒自由党之特里维特及德温特。最后，司法大臣左威特代表工党政府回答时，对各发言者未提及一年前的三国外长莫斯科宣言表示诧异。他指出：该宣言曾说明三国外长一致同意统一的民主中国，民主分子应广泛参加中国政府各级机构，停止国内战争，及外国不得干涉中国的需要。他说：“根据此项一致的政策，英国不愿看到中国遭受到任何一个集团或政党所强行的极权统治。英国政府欢迎实践莫斯科宣言。关于民主分子广泛参加国民政府，英国不是盲目地遵行任何别国政府的政策。”左威特于结语中说：“当世界如此一大部分处于内战的不幸情况下时，世界是不会繁荣的。……英国政府当坚决遵守不干涉中国内政的决定，并诚恳希望中国的痛苦迅速获致幸福的结果，并愿竭尽其力量所及的一切援助每个人达到此项幸福的结果。”左氏于演说中尚提到英国对华“总目的”与美国一样，即“与一个强大的巩固的能够忠实执行其义务并且是基于广泛的民主基础上的政府共事与往来，除此以外，我们未负有任何义务。”并愿为中英贸易有恢复之必要。此次辩论对目前中英新商约谈判情形，包括英在华航权及在华财产表示关怀。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】美联社二十四日讯：林德西伯爵二十三日在英上院提议英国派遣代表往延安，以“获得事实真象”。林氏告上院，他对蒋介石政府“甚为轻视”。按林德西伯爵为英国牛津大学波立奥德学院之院长，一九四五年为英上院（贵族院）议员，其子林迈可教授战前在北平燕京大学任物理教授，太平洋战争爆发后，离平经晋察冀解放区至延安，去年离延返国。
