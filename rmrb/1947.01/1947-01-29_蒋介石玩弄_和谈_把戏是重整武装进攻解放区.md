Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. A Moscow broadcast on the 25th: Commentator Masinu, commenting on the Kuomintang's suggestion to resume "peace talks," pointed out: At the beginning of last year, there was a ceasefire agreement and resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but neither was realized. The reason can be found in Marshall's recent statement, that the reactionary groups that dominate the Kuomintang government are strongly opposed to the coalition government and advocate a military solution. Masinu said: "Chinese democrats, based on their experience last year, do not believe that the Kuomintang's current 'peace' intentions are sincere, and believe that this is just a trick by the reactionaries to repeat last year's tactics, using 'peace talks' to consolidate seized positions, compensate for serious losses, request new American weapons, and then break the agreement and launch new and larger-scale armed attacks against the liberated areas. Therefore, Chinese democrats emphasize that sincere negotiations should be based on a reliable foundation, namely, the ceasefire order of January 10th and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference last year. The CCP fully demonstrated its sincerity last year, and now it is time for the Kuomintang to show its sincerity as well!"

    蒋介石玩弄“和谈”把戏是重整武装进攻解放区
    【新华社延安二十七日电】莫斯科二十五日广播：评论员马西努于评论国民党关于恢复“和谈”的建议时指出：去年年初也曾有过停战协定和政协决定，但都未能实现。原因可自马歇尔最近的声明中找到，即在国民党政府中占统治地位的反动集团极力反对联合政府和主张武力解决。马西努称：“中国民主人士因为去年的经验都不相信国民党现在的‘和平’意念是真诚的，而都认为这不过是反动派企图重复去年的把戏，利用‘和谈’以便巩固夺得的阵地、补偿严重的损失、要求新的美国武器，然后再破坏协定，展开新的更大规模的武装进攻，反对解放区。因此，中国民主人士着重指出：诚恳的谈判应建立在可靠的基础上，即建立在去年一月十日停战令及政协决议的基础上。去年一年中，中共充分表示了自己的诚意，现在该看国民党也来表示它的诚意了！”
