Anglo-Soviet relations are becoming increasingly close.

Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union later this month, symbolizing improved Anglo-Soviet relations, is considered by the British press to be "the most important event of the winter." The British people welcome this move, and the British press suggests that after Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union, Soviet Chief of General Staff Vasilevsky should also visit Britain. This, following the signing of the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement in Germany, is another piece of news welcomed by peace-loving and democratic people around the world.

National self-defense wars in the East and Europe continue. In Vietnam, the war has reached a stalemate, and the forces of the French reactionaries are insufficient. Although the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly called for peace, the French reactionaries are unwilling to stop the war. The French Socialist government stated on the 26th of last month that its policy towards Vietnam remains unchanged and will continue to increase its troops in Vietnam. The result will undoubtedly provoke more resolute resistance from the Vietnamese people. In Indonesia, the Dutch army is plotting to launch a new war. The Indonesian Republican government is able to mobilize national strength to strive for victory. The position of democratic forces in Indonesia in the new regime is becoming increasingly important. In the recent reorganization of the National Committee, the Communist Party has increased from one seat to thirty-five seats. In Greece, the democratic army is deeply supported by the masses and its strength is expanding. It recently occupied the central city of Bybac, and the reactionary government's army has proven powerless against it.

A new American political group (the Progressive Citizens of America) has recently formed a powerful lineup of the American people against American reactionaries.

The first year after the war has passed, and people all over the world are entering 1947 with new strides.

    英苏关系日益密切
    象征着改善英苏关系的蒙哥马利本月下旬访苏之行，被英报认为“将是冬季中最重要的事件”。英国人民欢迎此举，英报并建议在蒙氏访苏之后，苏军参谋总长华西列夫斯基亦能赴英一行。这是继英苏签订在德境之贸易协定后，又一个受世界和平民主人士欢迎的消息。
    东方和欧洲民族自卫战争仍在持续中。在越南，战事已呈胶着状态，法国反动派的兵力已不敷用，虽然越南民主政府多番呼吁，但法国反动派仍不愿停战。法国社会党政府于上月二十六日声明对越政策不变，并继续增兵越南，其结果无疑将引起越南人民更坚决的抵抗。在印尼，荷军则阴谋发动新战争，印尼共和政府已能动员全国力量争取胜利，印尼民主力量在新政权中的地位日益重要，在最近民族委员会的改组中，共产党已由一席增至三十五席。在希腊，民主军深受群众拥护，力量在扩大中。曾于最近一度占领中部的拜巴昔城，反动政府的军队已证实对它无能为力。
    美国新的政治团体（美国进步公民会）最近已组成美国人民反对美国反动派的一个强有力的阵容。
    战后的第一年已经过去了，全世界人民正以新的步伐，进入一九四七年。
