　　Announcement by the Government of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the Progress of the Yellow River Returning to its Old Course Project

Regarding the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course, the Kuomintang reactionaries initially carried out unilateral damming, disregarding the lives and property of residents in the old course area. Subsequently, under pressure from public opinion both domestically and internationally, and through the efforts of the liberated areas, they had to reach an agreement with us, acknowledging that damming and water release could only occur after the dike restoration and river dredging projects were completed. They also agreed to provide the necessary funds for the project and assist residents in the riverbed with relocation. However, over the past year, they have actively pursued damming and water release, while significantly falling short on providing the agreed-upon funds for the dike restoration and river dredging projects in the old course area. They have also intentionally sabotaged the dike works, preventing the timely and smooth completion of the old course dike restoration and river dredging projects. Therefore, even the Kuomintang acknowledges that "the dike sections within the Communist-controlled areas are far from the original standards, and some dike sections have been leveled, completely losing their flood control capacity, presenting an unspeakable state of danger..." (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th). The Kuomintang is well aware of the condition of the dikes in the old course area, yet they are intensifying the damming of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, and the river mouth is about to be blocked. The water entering the old course of the Yellow River is gradually becoming turbulent, reaching the vicinity of Linpu, revealing their plot to deliberately drown millions of our people in the old course area. To coordinate with their water release scheme, the Kuomintang, through its Water Conservancy Commission, also issued shameless slanders on the 6th, falsely accusing the CCP of obstructing river management. The Kuomintang's Peace Daily has further twisted the truth, confused the public, and engaged in the most extreme forms of rumor-mongering and slander. We hereby make public the progress of the Yellow River management over the past year to the society, to set the record straight, and urgently appeal to just individuals at home and abroad to save our seven million people along the river from danger.

In 1938, the Kuomintang breached the Huayuankou dike, causing an unprecedented disaster for six million people in the provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. After Japan's surrender, the dictator Chiang Kai-shek, in coordination with his conspiracy to attack the liberated areas on an unprecedented scale, carried out unilateral damming under the beautiful guise of water conservancy construction and Yellow River restoration, disregarding the lives and property of our seven million people in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region.

According to Song Haihan, Director of the Engineering Department of the National Water Conservancy Commission, on January 30th of last year, "The plan for the Yellow River to return to its old course was finalized in October of the year before last (1945)." The Yellow River embankment is 1,488 li long, two-thirds of which is in our liberated area. The embankments were mostly destroyed during the war, and hundreds of thousands of people live within the riverbed. However, the Kuomintang not only did not consult with the government of the liberated area, but did not even issue a notification. What else could this be but a determined plot to drown our people in the liberated area!

On January 11th of last year, Kuomintang government Yellow River Commission advisor Tadd and five others arrived in Heze, claiming to be there to survey the old Yellow River dikes. Our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office immediately extended a warm welcome and led them to survey the breach at Jiangsu Dam near Linpu. They only stayed in Heze for two days, left without any consultation, and soon after, Kuomintang newspapers began to fabricate rumors accusing us of obstructing the survey and decided to proceed with damming before the dike restoration was completed. The damming work at Huayuankou began in early February.

We deeply understand that the Yellow River returning to its old course will bring great disasters to the people in the old course area in the future. However, to allow the people in the new Yellow River flood areas of Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui to escape the disaster caused by Chiang Kai-shek, we also support the return to the old course, provided that the water is released after the river is dredged and the dikes are restored, and the people in the old course area are not drowned. We have repeatedly stated our position. What we firmly oppose is the Kuomintang damming the river without restoring the dikes. Because the Yellow River has changed its course for eight years, the riverbed is more than one zhang higher than the ground level, and more than 1,700 new villages have been built in the riverbed. The destruction caused by the enemy during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War has left the old dikes in ruins, and the repair work is enormous, which cannot be completed in a few months. In addition, our liberated area has suffered greatly from the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and four years of famine, and the people's strength has been greatly depleted. Therefore, our border region government has been trying to negotiate with the Yellow River Commission, while establishing Yellow River Commissions at all levels in Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and extensively recruiting river management talents to plan dike restoration projects, survey the dikes on both sides, investigate residents in the riverbed, and plan relocation and relief matters. However, the Kuomintang government did not consult with us, and on March 1st, it held a groundbreaking ceremony in Huayuankou and officially started damming. The people in our area were panicked when they heard the news. In addition to sending telegrams to the Yellow River Commission and the Relief Administration, putting forward our views and pleading for the people, the border region government and the參議會 also sent Chao Zhefu, Jia Xinqi, Zhao Mingfu and other three representatives to Bianliang (Kaifeng) to discuss in person. Chao and others set off for Bianliang on March 23rd. On the 25th, they were unreasonably detained by the Kuomintang's 40th Army while passing through Anyang. After several negotiations, they were released and arrived in Bianliang. After negotiating with Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Commission, representatives of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) and Henan Provincial Government, a preliminary agreement on river management was formally signed in Kaifeng on April 7th. The agreement stipulated that the final damming should not be carried out before the dike restoration and river dredging are fully completed, the river management agencies should adhere to the principle of unified cooperation, and should be handled by personnel from both sides. The relocation and relief funds for the residents in the riverbed should be submitted by the Yellow River Commission to the government for approval, and should be applied for from the CRRRA and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).

On April 8th, the Yellow River Survey Team, jointly composed of Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Commission, advisor Tadd, Han Liting, investigator from CRRRA, advisor Fan Mingde, and seven others, arrived in Heze and surveyed eastward along the river, passing through 17 counties. After completing the survey on the 15th, they returned to Heze. Zhao and others unanimously believed that the dikes along the river were too severely damaged, and admitted that more than 30% of the dikes needed to be repaired. Therefore, that evening, Zhao Shouyu and six others from the Yellow River Commission and representatives from the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Bohai District Administrative Offices of our liberated area jointly concluded the "Agreement on River Management and Course Change," the main points of which were: 1. After the completion of the dike restoration and river dredging, straightening the bends, and rectifying dangerous sections, the river will be closed and the water will be released. 2. For newly built villages in the riverbed, the Yellow River Commission will request the Executive Yuan to allocate relocation fees of (legal tender) 100,000 yuan per person. 3. The Yellow River Commission will apply to the CRRRA and UNRRA for relief on behalf of the residents. 4. The Director and Deputy Director of the Shanxi and Shandong Repair and Defense Offices will be appointed separately by the Yellow River Commission and the liberated area.

After the Heze Agreement, the Kuomintang did not implement it, but insisted on the two-month damming plan and continued to intensify the damming. Zhao Mingfu, our representative stationed at the Yellow River Commission in Kaifeng, immediately questioned the Yellow River Commission, and on the 20th, he discussed with Lin Kaijia, Wang Yunqing and other representatives of the Yellow River Commission and the Kuomintang in Henan at Huayuankou again. At that time, our side proposed that only the east and west dike heads should be reinforced before the flood, and the river should be closed and the water should be released after the downstream dike restoration, river dredging, and repair of dangerous sections were completed. Lin, Wang and other Kuomintang representatives disagreed, so it was decided that all parties would discuss again on May 8th to resolve the issue.

At the May meeting, the Kuomintang still insisted on the two-month damming plan regardless of the dike restoration in the old course, so the negotiations were fruitless again. Therefore, we sent Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi to Beijing to negotiate with the Kuomintang Central Government. On the 17th and 18th, the National Water Conservancy Commission, the Yellow River Commission, and the representatives of the CRRRA and the UNRRA held formal meetings at the Executive Yuan, and reached an agreement: 1. The downstream urgent dike restoration project, including dangerous sections and the entire river channel rectification, should be completed as soon as possible. At the same time, the overall project should be planned and promoted in a coordinated manner. The necessary materials and public grain should be given priority and supplied by the CRRRA and UNRRA as soon as possible. The necessary construction funds should be fully raised by the Water Conservancy Commission and should be started before June 5th. 2. The problem of relocation and relief for the residents of the river channel has been filed by the Yellow River Commission and should be handled as soon as possible. 3. The damming project will continue, but it should be based on the principle of not causing water damage downstream. Zhao and Wang also raised reservations: The driving of piles and throwing of rocks before the flood should not exceed two meters from the riverbed, but it should not be affected by any military or political factors. The new Bian-Xu Highway should not be demolished temporarily, and no diversion canals should be dug.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府公布
    黄河归故交涉及工程进行经过
    国民党反动派对于黄河归故问题，始则单独进行片面堵口，置故道居民生命财产于不顾。继而，在全世界全国舆论压迫及解放区努力争取之下，不得不与我成立协议，承认复堤浚河工程完竣后始能堵口放水，并发给工程必需之资财，帮助河床居民解决迁移困难。但，一年以来，彼所积极进行者为堵口放水，对故道复堤浚河工程，则不仅协议应拨之资财，尚差甚伙，且对堤工横加破坏，致故道复堤浚河工程，不能如期顺利完成。故在国民党方面，亦承认“中共区域内之堤段，与原来标准相差甚远，甚或有堤段平夷，全失防水能力者，险状不可言喻，……”（中央社南京七日电）故道堤工如此为国民党所深知，但花园口黄河堵口工程，则加紧抛石、现口门已将被堵塞，引入黄河故道之水，逐渐湍急，已达临濮集附近，其蓄意淹毙我故道数百万人民之阴谋，已昭然若揭。国民党配合其放水阴谋，并由水利委员会六日发表中共阻挠治河情形的无耻谰言，国民党和平日报复颠倒是非，淆乱视听，造谣侮蔑达于极点。兹特将去年一年来治黄经过公诸社会、以正视听，并向国内外正义人士紧急呼吁，挽救我沿河七百万人民于危难。
    民国二十七年，国民党决花园口大堤，使豫皖苏三省六百万人民，遭受空前浩劫，日本投降后，独夫蒋介石，配合其以空前规模进攻解放区的阴谋，在水利建设黄河复员的美妙名词下，进行片面堵口，置我冀鲁豫七百万人民生命财产于不顾。
    据全国水利委员会工程处长宋海涵氏于去年一月三十日谈称：“前年（三十四年）十月间就将黄河归故计划好了”，查黄河堤岸长达一千四百八十八里，其中三分之二在我解放区、堤岸因战争多被平毁，河床内住有数十万人民，但当时国民党不仅未与解放区政府进行任何协商，且连一个通知亦无，其非决心阴谋淹毙我解放区人民为何！
    去年一月十一日国民党政府黄委会顾问塔德等六人到荷泽，声言系来勘察黄河旧堤，我冀鲁豫行署当即予以热情招待，并引领彼等勘察临濮集附近之江苏坝决口处，彼等在荷泽仅停留两天，未作任何商洽即离去，不久国民党报纸即大肆造谣诬我阻挠勘察，并决定不问复堤如何结束，先行堵口。二月初即开始花园口堵口工作。
    我们深知黄河归故今后给故道地区人民带来了极大的灾难，但为照顾豫苏皖黄河新泛区人民脱离蒋介石所造成的灾害，在浚河复堤之后放水，不使故道人民被淹毙条件下，我们亦赞成归故，我们已一再表明我们的态度，我们坚决反对者，是国民党不复堤即堵口，因黄河改道已八年之久，河床高出地面一丈以上，河床内新建村庄已有一千七百多个，八年抗日战争中敌人的破坏，旧堤坝残破不堪，修补工程浩大，决非几个月所能完成，加之我解放区经过八年抗战、四年灾荒，民力消耗甚大，因此我边区政府遂一面设法争取与黄委会进行商谈：一面在冀鲁豫设立各级黄委会，并广延治河人材计划复堤工程勘察两岸堤埝，调查河床内居民策划迁移救济事宜等。但国民党政府不与我协商，于三月一日即在花园口举行破土典礼，正式动工堵口。我区人民闻讯惊惶万状，边区政府及参议会，除致电黄委会及救济总署，提出我方意见，为民请命外，并派晁哲甫、贾心齐、赵明甫等三代表赴汴面商。晁等于三月二十三日首途赴汴，二十五日行经安阳时，饱受国民党四十军之无理留难，几经交涉始被释抵汴。经与黄委会赵守钰委员长，联总行总及河南省府代表等谈判，于四月七日在开封正式签订治河初步协议，协议在复堤浚河未全部完工前绝不最后堵口，治河机构应本统一合作原则，由双方参加人员办理，河床居民之迁移救济费一面由黄委会呈请政府核发，一面分向行总联总申请救济。
    四月八日，黄委会赵守钰委员长、塔德顾问、联总调查专员韩立亭、顾问范铭德等十人，联合组成之黄河勘查团，到达荷泽，并沿河东下勘查，经十七县，于十五日勘查完毕返回荷泽，赵等一致认为沿河堤坝破坏太甚，并承认百分之三十以上的大堤须修补，因此乃于当晚由黄委会赵守钰等七人与我解放区冀鲁豫、渤海区两行署代表，共同订立，“治河改道协议”，其要点为：一、复堤浚河，裁湾取直，整理险工等工程完竣后再行合龙放水。二、河床内新建村庄，由黄委会呈请行政院每人拨发迁移费（法币）十万元。三、由黄委会代请联总行总救济。四、冀鲁两省修防处正副主任，由黄委会及解放区分别派人担任。
    荷泽协议后，国民党并未执行，依然坚持两月堵口计划，继续加紧堵口。我驻开封黄委会代表赵明甫当即向黄委会提出质问，并于二十日至花园口与黄委会及河南国民党代表林开甲、王芸青等再度商议，当时我方曾提出堵口部分大泛前只加培东西堤头，俟下游复堤浚河，修理险工等工程完竣后，再合龙放水，国民党代表林、王等不表同意，故又决定于五月八日再由各方商谈解决。
    五月会议，国民党仍不顾故道复堤如何，坚持两月堵口计划，故谈判又毫无结果。我遂又派赵明甫、王笑一两氏赴京与国民党中央协商，十七、十八两日在行政院水利委员会与全国水委会、黄委会、联总及行总代表正式开会，并获协议：一、下游急要复堤工程，包括险工及全部整理河漕，尽先完成，同时规划全部工程衔接推进，所需之器材公粮，请联总行总优先尽速供给，所需工款，则由水利委员会充分筹拨，争取于六月五日前开工。二、河道居民迁移救济问题，黄委会已呈请有案，应从速办理。三、堵口工程继续进行，但以不使下游发生水害为原则。赵、王并提出保留意见：大泛前打桩抛石以不超出河底两公尺为限，但须不受任何军事政治影响，新汴公路暂不拆除，不挖引河等。
                （未完）
