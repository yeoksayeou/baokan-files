　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th—Reports from various sources: The general strike in London has sparked waves of sympathy strikes due to outrage over the army replacing striking workers in more locations. The total number of striking workers has exceeded 50,000. Market workers and porters at various London docks were the first to hold sympathy strikes. This was immediately followed on the 15th by 17,000 London dockworkers walking off the job. In Birmingham, 15,000 transport workers and 4,000 sailors on the Thames River announced on the 15th that if the strike continued for another day, they would also leave their jobs.

　　伦敦工潮继续扩大
    【新华社延安十七日电】各方报导：伦敦市的大罢工，由于军队在更多的地方代替罢工工人的工作，而激起义愤的同情罢工，遂接二连三的爆发。罢工工人的总数已超过五万人。首先举行同情罢工的是市场工人和伦敦各码头的搬运夫。紧接其后的是十五日一万七千伦敦码头工人离开工作。伯明翰之一万五千运输工人与泰晤士河上之四千水手，于十五日宣告如果罢工再持续一日，他们亦将离开工作。
