　　Cultivating Good Gunners and Improving Mortars
    Zhao Zhangcheng Receives Commendation from Military Region
    [Report from this newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently issued a circular commending Comrade Zhao Zhangcheng's achievements and innovations in artillery training and weapon improvement. Comrade Zhao Zhangcheng is a well-known, highly accurate gunner in this region. As early as the Red Army era, he was responsible for training artillery cadres. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, he has held more than ten artillery training classes in this region, cultivating nearly a thousand artillery cadres and excellent gunners. His students are spread throughout the various mortar units in the region, enabling the continuous development of our army's artillery units and the general and continuous improvement of shooting techniques. He overcame problems that could not be solved theoretically and created new technologies not found in regulations. In his teaching methods, he particularly emphasized practice, with less lecturing and more doing, and emphasized live ammunition shooting. Each shell, as long as the safety catch is properly applied and more primers and powder packs are prepared, can be fired repeatedly more than forty times. Another major contribution of Comrade Zhao Zhangcheng is the improvement of weapons. The special mortar device he invented has been adopted by the entire army, playing a significant role in our army's inferior equipment situation. However, he is still immersed in research and continuous improvement, and it is expected that he will have new creations in the near future.
