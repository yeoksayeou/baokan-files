　　Mobilizing Backward Peasants: Taihang Gains Experience
　　I. Overcome complacency and contempt for backward thinking among cadres and activists.
　　II. Let backward peasants know that people with "no problems" can also turn over.
　　III. Guide backward peasants to awaken and let them mobilize themselves.
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi report] During the winter land reform and large-scale inspection campaign in the Taihang old and new liberated areas, universal attention was paid to mobilizing backward masses, and new experiences were gained. At the beginning of the movement, the District Party Committee loudly proposed: "Face the backward." In the past two months, the counties in the new and old areas have regarded mobilizing the backward masses as the main goal of deepening the movement and filling gaps. The following experiences have also been gained on how to mobilize backward masses: First, the reasons why backward masses are backward: first, the existence of ideas such as "conscience," "fate," and "relationships," such as Hao Xingchang, a poverty-stricken man in Lingdi, Shexian County, said: "Poverty and wealth are determined by Heaven. If we overthrow the landlords, we will have nowhere to beg for food." An old farmer in Shenshantou, Lingchuan, said: "In the past, we begged from them (referring to landlords), but now we struggle against them. My conscience can't bear it. Let it be." Second is the "change of weather" mentality. For example, Guo Xibao, a poverty-stricken man in Yincheng Town, Changzhi, was afraid of "change of weather" and returned the two acres of land he had been allocated last year to the landlord Zhang Ziqing. He is still poverty-stricken. Landlords in Dongshuiyang Village, Licheng, spread rumors saying, "Now you (referring to peasants) turn me over, and in the future, I will turn you over." Many honest farmers were frightened and dared not raise any opinions. Thirdly, some middle peasants were afraid of being struggled against and dared not raise any opinions even if they had been oppressed. For example, in Wuqing Village, Changzhi, eight middle peasants served as puppet soldiers. After washing their faces and blackening their names last year, they thought, "We people will never be able to turn over." A middle peasant said, "I lent out a few dollars. I don't dare to mention any grievances." Second, in the past movements, cadres took over everything and did not care about the backward masses. For example, the village chief of Yungutu Village, Lingchuan, reflected: "I used to dislike backward people and didn't want to struggle, just wanted to divide things. I often criticized them at meetings. So they became more and more afraid to speak." For the vast number of women, many cadres believed that women did not understand things. In the past, they did not care about things, and now there is no need to mobilize them. Third, the distribution of fruits was unfair. In the past, the distribution principle in many places was: whoever raises a problem gets a share; whoever is active gets a bigger share. In some places (such as Nanzhuanggou, Pingshun), the landlords were allowed to sell their things for rice and then distribute it to the masses. Therefore, those who had no problems to raise, had no rice to buy things, and dared not speak had no chance to turn over. So many poverty-stricken people said, "Turning over or not, it has nothing to do with us." Forming a situation where "those who have something to do with the landlord sing, and those who have nothing to do watch." They do not participate in the struggle, nor do they share the fruits, and they always stand outside the movement circle, so they are still backward. At the same time, after a movement, the cadres felt that it was "almost done." They only looked at the achievements and did not go deep to discover problems. Second, how to mobilize the backward masses? First, check each household and use concrete facts to break the village cadres' "almost done" mentality. For example, after visiting each household in Ma Village, an old area of ​​Wu'an, it was found that there were still twenty-seven poverty-stricken households that had not turned over. The village cadres were shocked: "I didn't pay attention to these people in the past!" The Second District of Xiangyuan held a joint meeting of honest farmers and village cadres. At the beginning, the village cadres all said, "Our village is almost done." Later, many honest farmers said that they had not turned over. The village cadres then said, "I dare not be careless, I have to check carefully when I go back." In Tongtan Town, Zuoquan, more than one hundred poor peasants were found who had never participated in the struggle in the past few years. The village cadres suddenly said, "After making revolution for a few years, it hasn't been made to the right people (that is, those who urgently need to turn over)." Second, break the cadres and activists' contempt for backward masses, and make them consciously mobilize the backward. For example, in Xinyi Village, Changzhi, the cadres and activists discussed "Can we do it alone?" When everyone realized that "more people means greater strength," the leadership immediately proposed: "Everyone should lend a hand (help) people." The movement to mobilize backward people quickly started. Third, widely publicize the "land to the tiller" policy. For example, Huguan proposed: "Those who till the land should have land to till." Changzhi proposed: "Repay thousands of years of grievances at once, fill the gaps with whatever you don't have." Make backward peasants know that people with "no problems" can also turn over. Fourth, cadres and activists personally take action, "Use suffering to induce suffering, touch their minds, and strike at their pain." Experience has proved that mobilizing backward elements cannot directly overcome their backward thinking from the front. We must guide and enlighten them from many aspects to improve their ideological awareness. In the First District of the city, the cadres personally found the most backward peasants, used their own suffering to induce the peasants' suffering, enlightened their awareness, and then let them use the same method to mobilize more masses. For example, the cadres of Xiwu Village first mobilized the hired worker Zhang Shiqin, and then let Zhang Shiqin mobilize the most backward hired worker Liu Rensuo. Shidong Village, Changzhi, proposed: "Touch their minds, strike at their pain, what is the disease, prescribe the medicine." An old lady in the village who was a military dependent suffered the most. After more than ten mobilizations by district cadres and activists, they failed to mobilize her because they could not touch her mind. Later, they replaced her with activist Xinlu to mobilize them. He knew that what she loved most was the few apricot trees that were cut down by the landlord Li Hecheng. She was beaten severely by Li Hecheng for resisting. This was her lifelong hatred. When Xinlu saw her, he talked about household affairs and said when he talked about the apricot trees: "Auntie, it's a pity that those few trees were cut down by Li Hecheng." He touched her heart at once, and she started talking endlessly, tears streaming down. Xinlu said again: "Auntie, people have complained and avenged their revenge. What about you? Are you giving up?" She patted her knees and said: "I won't give up. I must settle the score with him." When thoroughly liquidating the landlord Li Hecheng, she became an activist.

### 发动落后农民  太行取得经验

　　发动落后农民  太行取得经验
    一、打破干部积极分子自满及轻视落后思想。
    二、让落后农民知道“没问题”人也能翻身。
    三、诱导落后农民觉悟，让他们自己发动自己。
    【本报长治讯】太行新老区冬季翻身大检查运动中，普遍注意了发动落后群众，并获得了新的经验。运动开始时，区党委即响亮提出：“面向落后”。两月来，新老区各县都把发动落后群众，当做深入运动，填平补齐的主要目标。对于怎样发动落后群众，也获得如下经验：一、落后群众所以落后的原因：首先是存在着“良心”、“命运”、“情面”等思想，如涉县岭底赤贫郝兴常说：“穷富天照定、斗垮了老财，咱们可就没地方要饭啦。”陵川神山头一老农说：“过去咱求人家（指地主），如今咱斗人家，良心下不来，疼过的肉，算了吧。”其次是“变天”思想。如长治荫城镇赤贫郭喜保因怕“变天”，把去年分到的二亩地，又还给地主张子清，自己至今仍是赤贫。黎城东水洋村地主造谣说：“现在你们（指农民）翻我的身，将来我好翻你们的身。”吓的许多老实农民没敢提意见。再次是有些中农怕斗自己，受过压迫，也不敢提意见。如长治五庆村有八个中农，当过伪军，去年经过洗脸擦黑，他们就认为：“咱这些人一辈也不能提翻身啦。”一个中农说：“咱放过几块钱的债，有甚冤枉也不敢提。”二、过去运动中，干部包办代替，不管落后群众。如陵川云谷图村长反省说：“我过去就嫌落后人讨厌，不想斗争，光想分东西，我常在大会上碰他们。所以他们就越不敢说话了。”对于广大妇女，许多干部认为：女人们不懂事，过去她们不管事，现在也不用去发动她们。三、果实分配不公。过去许多地方的分配原则是：谁提问题谁分；谁积极谁多分，有的地方（如平顺南庄沟）是让地主把东西变买成米再分给群众，因之那些既无问题可提，又无米去买东西，也不敢发言的赤贫就没有翻身机会，所以许多赤贫说说：“翻身不翻身，与咱没啥。”形成“与地主有事的唱，没事的瞧。”不参加斗争，又不分果实，永远站在运动圈外，所以还落后。同时干部在经过一次运动，就觉着“差不多”了。只看成绩，不去深入发现问题。第二、怎样发动落后群众呢？一、挨户检查，用具体事实打破村干部的“差不多”思想。如武安老区马村，经挨户访问，发现尚有二十七户赤贫未翻过身，村干部大吃一惊：“过去就没注意这些人！”襄垣二区召开老实农民与村干部联席会，开头村干部都说：“俺村已差不多”，后来许多老实农民说他们还没翻身，村干部才说：“可不敢大意，回去还得仔细检查”；左权桐滩镇，检查出一百多个贫农，几年来从未参加过斗争，村干部始恍然的说：“闹了几年翻身，还没闹到正经人（即迫切需要翻身的）身上”。二、打破干部与积极分子轻视落后群众的思想，使他们自觉地来发动落后。如长治信义村在干部积极分子中，讨论“光咱们行不行”，待大家觉悟到“人多力量大”时，领导上即提出：“大家都要拉把（帮助）人”，发动落后人的运动很快就开展起来。三、广泛宣传耕者有其田政策。如壶关提出：“种地的人应当有地种”；长治提出：“千年冤仇一次报，没甚分甚填圪道”。使落后农民知道了“没问题”也能翻身。四、干部积极分子亲自动手，“以苦引苦摸心思，打痛心”。经验证明，发动落后分子，不能直接从正面来克服其落后思想。必须从多方面诱导启发，提高其思想觉悟。城一区，干部亲自找最落后的农民，用自己的苦来引农民的苦，启发其觉悟，再让他们用同样的办法，去发动更多的群众，如西仵村干部便是先把雇工张石琴发动起来，又让张石琴把最落后的雇工刘仁锁，也发动起来了。长治石董村提出：“摸心思、打痛心、有什么病、下什么药。”该村一军属老太太，受苦最多，经过区干部与积极分子十多次动员，都因为摸不着他的心思，而未把他发动起来。后来换上积极分子新禄去发动他们，他知道她最心爱的是那几棵杏树，被地主李和成砍去了，她因反抗还被李和成痛打了一顿，这是她一辈的心头大恨。新禄见了他，从家常事谈到杏树时说：“大娘，你那几棵树可惜叫李和成砍走啦。”一下打动了她的心，她就滔滔不绝的说起来，眼泪纷纷掉下。新禄又说：“大娘，人家们都诉了苦，报了仇，你呢？就拉倒呀？”她拍着膝盖说：“不拉倒，非跟他算账不行。”彻底清算地主李和成时，她便成了积极分子。
