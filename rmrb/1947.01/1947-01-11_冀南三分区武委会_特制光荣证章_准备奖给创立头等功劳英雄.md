　　Jinnan Third Military Subdistrict Committee
    Specially Made Honorary Medals
  　Preparing to Award Heroes Who Have Made First-Class Meritorious Service
    [Our Newspaper Weixian 9th Dispatch] The Jinnan Second District Committee and Third Military Subdistrict Committee called for resolutely crushing Chiang Kai-shek's invasion and universally launching a meritorious service movement. The Second District Committee instructed each county to combine the mass movement with war preparations. In areas where the masses have been mobilized, conduct a major inspection immediately. Village cadres organize inspection teams to check house by house, solve problems when they are encountered, emphasize that middle and poor peasants are one family, and compensate without hesitation for past damage to the interests of middle peasants. The border areas strengthen the struggle against the enemy, overcome the paralyzing thoughts of party members and cadres, and universally launch a mass meritorious service movement. In order to promote the special skills and enthusiasm of all militiamen and cadres, the Third Military Subdistrict Committee instructed military committees at all levels to establish merit books to record the merits of local militiamen and cadres in a timely manner. In addition to being commended in newspapers, comrades who have made first-class meritorious service will be awarded an honorary medal. A grand ceremony will be held when wearing this medal, and the responsible cadres will personally hang it on the hero. At present, the local militiamen are actively responding to the call, preparing to launch guerrilla warfare and be listed in the merit book.
