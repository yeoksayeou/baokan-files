(This report from Weixian, January 8th) Ji County has paid attention to mobilizing women in the peasant emancipation movement and has gained several experiences. In September, the leadership thoroughly criticized the stage theory of women's work and the idea of an independent women's movement, and focused on mobilizing the broad masses of working women to participate in the peasant movement. Initially, many comrades were limited to addressing the issue of abuse, but they gradually changed after actually studying women's demands. During a forum of women's association members in a certain village, they reported that their main demand was to solve the problem of "poverty." Three women had no houses to live in and were constantly evicted by the landlords and rich peasants from their houses; one daughter-in-law had only one set of clothes for the entire summer. Later, they were guided to discuss participating in the peasant emancipation movement, and they were very excited and immediately felt that the women's organization in their village had to be reorganized because some people inside the organization were not of one mind with the poor. The forum helped us to understand more specifically that the basic suffering of peasant women was feudal economic exploitation; the constraints of feudal ethics were secondary. Therefore, the women's movement also had its class character.

After this problem was solved, a large number of working women poured into the peasant emancipation movement, and the slogan of uniting 90% of the masses became a reality. According to statistics, the members participating in the struggle in 47 villages in the first district consisted of 3,762 men and 3,944 women (accounting for 51%). In Machangzhuang and Beiguan, women accounted for more than 70% of the members participating in the struggle. They were brave and enthusiastic in the struggle, and a large number of outstanding women leaders emerged, some of whom have become chairpersons of the village peasant associations. Women's participation in the mass movement not only alleviated the economic oppression of the vast number of women, but also greatly improved women's political status, changed the traditional view of belittling women, improved the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, sisters-in-law, and promoted family democracy and harmony. Many old ladies joined their daughters and daughters-in-law in participating in the struggle, complaining together, and sharing the fruits of victory together. They were all proud of the active participation of the young women in their families.

Some villages in Ji County have created experiences in resolving internal problems through mediation and education, thereby solving women's demands. The women in Wang Village, Dili, in the second district, held a total of three meetings: the first was a forum for young women and middle-aged daughters-in-law with mothers-in-law to discuss and resolve their demands for clothing, visiting their parents' homes, and participating in social activities. The second was a meeting of young unmarried women, mainly to mobilize them to help their families with labor and overcome the bad habits of daughters siding with their parents to oppress daughters-in-law or instigating family disputes. The third was a meeting of mothers-in-law, at which the demands of the daughters-in-law and the women's federation's guarantee to the family were explained, emphasizing the importance of clearing up thinking. It was especially explained that after the new rules were established, when their own daughters got married, their husbands' families would take care of their clothing, which would save them a lot of worry. The old ladies were very happy to hear the opinions of the women's federation. They said that doing these things was all for the sake of making every family live a good life, and they expressed their determination to follow the rules. After the three meetings, everyone was very satisfied, and an atmosphere of family harmony gradually grew. Many women took the initiative to seek mediation from the women's association for family disputes, which had not happened in the past. After the emancipation movement, properly resolving women's special demands, production became an urgent demand of the women masses. The concept of leading women's work with production as the main focus was established, and bad habits such as being fond of dressing up and being extravagant and not engaging in production can be gradually changed.

　　冀县农民运动中发动妇女经验
    【本报威县八日电】冀县在农民翻身运动中，注意发动妇女，并获得几点经验。在九月份领导上清算了妇女工作的阶段论和妇女独立运动思想，注意了发动广大劳动妇女参加农民运动。起初有不少同志局限于从反虐待着手，经实际研究妇女要求，才慢慢转变。某村妇会妇女座谈时，他们反映的要求主要是解决“贫困”问题。有三个妇女没有房子住，在地主和富农的宅子里时，时遭受房主驱逐；一个媳妇一夏天只有一套单衣。后来引导她们讨论参加农民翻身运动，她们非常兴奋，并立即感到她村的妇女组织必须改组。因为组织内部有一些人和穷人不一心。座谈后使我们更具体的领会到农民妇女的基本痛苦是封建经济剥削；礼教束缚是次要的。因此妇女运动也是有其阶级性的。
    这个问题解决后，大批劳动妇女涌进农民翻身运动，团结百分之九十群众的口号也成了现实。据统计参加斗争的成员，一区四十七村，男的共三千七百六十二人，女的三千九百四十四人，（占百分之五十一）马厂庄及北关妇女均占参加斗争成员百分之七十以上。她们在斗争中勇敢热情，并出现了大批出色的妇女领袖，有的已作了村农民联合会的主席。妇女参加群运，不仅解除了广大妇女的经济压迫，并且大大提高了妇女的政治地位，改变了传统的轻视妇女观点，改善了婆媳之间、姑嫂之间的关系，促进了家庭民主和睦。不少老太太同她的女儿、媳妇一块去参加斗争，一块诉苦，一块分得果实，她们都以自家年轻女人的积极活动为荣。
    冀县已有一些村庄创造了以调解教育解决内部问题，从而解决了妇女要求的经验。二区堤里王村的妇女一共开了三个会；第一个是青年妇女与有婆婆的中年媳妇的座谈会，讨论解决他们的穿衣、走娘家、参加社会活动等要求。第二个是闺女会议，主要动员他们帮助自己家庭劳作，克服女儿站到父母方面压迫媳妇或挑拨家庭是非的坏习惯。第三个是婆婆会议，会议上说明媳妇的要求，和妇联会对家庭的保证，在强调了打通思想。特别说明立了新规矩以后，自己女儿出嫁了，婆家管穿了，也省了自己许多心。老太太听了妇联会的意见，非常喜悦，她们表示办这些事情都是为了叫家家过好日子，表示一定照着办。三个会议后，大家都很满意，家庭和睦的空气也渐渐生长起来，许多妇女对于家庭纠纷，都主动找妇会去调解，这是过去所没有的。经过了翻身运动，适当的解决了妇女特殊要求，生产就成为妇女群众迫切的要求了，领导妇女工作，以生产为主的观念树立了，好修饰、尚奢华等不事生产的毛病，便可逐渐改变。
