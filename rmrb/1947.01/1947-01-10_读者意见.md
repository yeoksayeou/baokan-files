    Reader Opinions
    To the Editors:
    Since the newspaper was founded, it has become a textbook for all of us to study current events and improve our work. If we don't read the newspaper for a day, we feel restless. Vice Chairman Rong is most concerned about the newspaper and often goes to the dispatch office to pick it up himself. After you published the request for opinions, I talked with many comrades, and I have a few small suggestions:
    (1) There are relatively few local news reports in the newspaper, and they are mostly comprehensive reports. This is beneficial for guiding the work of the entire region, but the various problems in the process of a certain type of work are rarely reported, and there are mostly drier numbers. For example, after the start of the self-defense war, the enthusiasm for joining the army and participating in the war, and the enthusiastic scenes of the masses sending off new soldiers are rarely reported, and more reports focus on how many people have joined the army in a certain county. This is just one example.
    (2) Since the General Political Department of Yan'an proposed strengthening military reporting in 1944 and obvious achievements have been made, many battle stories in the newspaper are also the most attractive. However, there are fewer reports on various model figures, stories, and newsletters during the "Land to the Tiller" movement in the border region. The "Mr. Chen" blackboard talk published in the newspaper is a very educational article. Many people who do not understand our policies will definitely have some changes in their thinking after reading it. In the past, this aspect was done poorly.
    (3) We welcome the fact that the documentation center compiles materials monthly, on time, and according to its nature, such as "Civil Uprisings in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas," etc. After reading them, they give us a deep impression. If possible in the future, I hope you can write something like a monthly work review. In addition, I hope the editors and proofreaders will be more careful and make fewer typos.

    读者意见
    编辑同志：
    报纸创刊以来，成了我们大家时事学习，业务学习的教科书，如果一天不看报纸，就觉得烦闷。戎副主席最关心报纸，常常自己到收发上取报。你们登出征求意见启事后，我就和许多同志交谈，有几点小意见：
    （一）报纸上地方消息比较少，且多是综合性的消息，这对于指导全区工作，有其一定之好处，但在一种工作过程中之种种问题，缺少报导，而多是较干燥的数字。如自卫战争开始后之参军参战热情，群众欢送新战士之热烈场面很少，而多报导了某县多少人入伍，这仅仅是一个例子。
    （二）自四四年延安总政提出加强军事报导及显见成绩，报纸上许多战斗故事也最易引人入胜，不过对于边区耕者有其田运动中之各种模范人物、故事、通讯，登载较少。报纸上登的“陈先生”板话，就是很有教育意义的文章。许多不明我们政策的人看了，思想上一定会起些变化。过去在这方面，做的较差。
    （三）资料室按月按时按它之性质，综合材料，我们最欢迎，如“国民党统治区之民变”等等，看了以后，给我们一种深刻的印象。今后如有可能，希望每月写一篇工作回顾之类东西。另外希望编辑及校对同志，更多细心，少出错字。（边府读者赵秀山）
