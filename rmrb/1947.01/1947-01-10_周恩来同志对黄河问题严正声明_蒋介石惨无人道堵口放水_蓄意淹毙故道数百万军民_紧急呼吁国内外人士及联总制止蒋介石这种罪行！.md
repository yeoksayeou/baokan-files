Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 8th: General Zhou Enlai has issued the following solemn statement regarding the damming of the Yellow River:

    At a time when the civil war on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is extremely tense, the Chiang Kai-shek government suddenly issued a strict order at the end of last month to the Zhengzhou military authorities and the Kaifeng Yellow River Dam Restoration Bureau to actively and forcibly dam the river at Huayuankou and release water, flooding residents along the old course of the Yellow River, the masses on both banks, and the self-defense forces of the Liberated Areas. The floodwaters have already crossed the Bianxin Road and will soon pass through Jinan and head east towards the Bohai Sea.

    This inhumane and cruel act by the Chiang Kai-shek government, since the breach at Huayuankou eight years ago, has already flooded 25,000 square kilometers of land in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, causing unprecedented catastrophe to more than six million people. Now, while the dike restoration project in the old course of the Yellow River has not been completed, the hazardous sections have not been straightened, and the residents of the old course have not been relocated, it is both damming the river and digging open the old course to divert the water. This will flood tens of thousands of square kilometers of land in Henan and Shandong provinces, resulting in the loss of the lives, homes, and property of millions of people. Chiang Kai-shek's intention in being so vicious is to use the force of the Yellow River to drown the people and troops in the Liberated Areas of Henan and Shandong, cut off the self-defense mobilization in the Liberated Areas, and destroy the production and supply in the Liberated Areas, in order to facilitate his attack and occupation, thereby achieving his military objectives. We request that all compatriots and international people of justice, standing on humanitarian grounds, unite to oppose and urgently stop this heinous act of damming and releasing water by the Chiang Kai-shek government!

    The Yellow River dam restoration plan was originally supported by UNRRA. In order to restore the flooded area of the past eight years to its original state and provide relief, we fundamentally do not oppose the implementation of this plan. However, at the same time, we insist on the principle of repairing the old course before damming the breach. Because we must not restore the old flooded area and create a new flooded area at the same time. Therefore, last summer, we reached several agreements with UNRRA, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and the Water Conservancy Commission. Each time, it was stipulated that the restoration of dikes, straightening of hazardous sections, and relocation of residents should be carried out; at the same time, the preparatory work for damming the breach upstream must be coordinated with this and must not be completed in advance. The date of damming must be decided after all the above work has been completed, through agreement between the three parties (the CCP Liberated Areas, UNRRA, and CRRRA). However, after the agreement, the Liberated Area government strictly abided by the agreement and made efforts to mobilize the people, completing four-fifths of the dike restoration project within one month. But at that time, the Chiang Kai-shek government violated the agreement by neither carrying out the dike restoration project near Kaifeng and Jinan, nor delaying the payment of wages and food for the workers for as long as a month and a half.

    By August, the civil war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek government to attack the Liberated Areas was in full swing. All unfinished and unstarted projects in the Liberated Areas along both banks of the Yellow River's old course could not continue and have been suspended ever since. However, the Yellow River Dam Restoration Bureau, disregarding the constraints of the agreement, independently rushed ahead with the preparatory work for damming the breach at Huayuankou, and completed all the work in December last year, waiting only for the implementation of damming and releasing water. Therefore, from the perspective of the project alone, since the downstream dike restoration project has not been completed, the hazardous sections have not been straightened, and the cutting off of bends has not yet begun, how can the upstream damming and releasing of water be carried out?

    The Chiang Kai-shek government stipulated that the restoration project should provide 66 billion in currency, but only 6 billion was given to the Liberated Areas. There are more than 600,000 residents of the old course, and the Liberated Areas requested that at least 22.5 billion be allocated for relief funds, but the Chiang Kai-shek government promised in July last year to allocate 15 billion first, but has not given a single penny to date, and the currency value has also plummeted, making it impossible for the residents of the old course to relocate.

    Combining the various facts, it can be seen that the attitude taken by the Chiang Kai-shek government on the Yellow River dam restoration project has exceeded the scope of unfairness, but has been consistently trying to harm the people and troops in the Liberated Areas by returning the Yellow River to its old course, in order to seek its military objectives. Sometimes, because of the pressure of domestic and international public opinion, it has to sign some agreements and stipulate some funds, but turns around and denies them!

    UNRRA has always taken post-war relief as its working principle, but most of its relief supplies, such as various machines, tools, and transportation equipment for the Yellow River dam restoration project, are used in the Huayuankou project, while the Liberated Area dike restoration project has received almost nothing. If we further link UNRRA's participation in the Yellow River dam restoration problem every time with its failure to prevent the Chiang Kai-shek government from violating the agreement every time, we cannot help but suspect how much truth there is in UNRRA's adherence to the principles of "no political discrimination" and "fair distribution." If the leaders of UNRRA want to prove that it is true, then we have the right to demand that the UNRRA China Office adopt a fair and clear attitude on the Yellow River dam restoration issue, immediately stop the Chiang Kai-shek government's current actions of damming and releasing water, and demand that the Chiang Kai-shek government and the Executive Yuan immediately allocate all the wages, food, machines, tools, transportation equipment, and all the relief funds for the river residents that the Liberated Areas are entitled to in accordance with past agreements, and must dam and release water only after the entire project of dike restoration, consolidation, straightening of dangerous sections, and cutting off of bends is completed.

    If the Chiang Kai-shek government does not accept the restraint and does not accept the above requirements, UNRRA has the right to stop all relief to the Chiang Kai-shek government. And first of all, all the machines, tools, ships, and transportation equipment used in the Huayuankou damming project should be withdrawn; this kind of just pressure is welcomed by the Chinese people. Because if these materials from UNRRA are not withdrawn and the assistance is not stopped, millions of Chinese people will be harmed. Conversely, these people can be saved. I hereby make this appeal on behalf of the 140 million people in the Liberated Areas to the World UNRRA and the people of the United Nations!

    The lives and property of millions of Chinese people will be determined in this last short period of time. We hope that all compatriots and national public opinion will rise up and appeal to save them urgently!

### 周恩来同志对黄河问题严正声明  蒋介石惨无人道堵口放水  蓄意淹毙故道数百万军民  紧急呼吁国内外人士及联总制止蒋介石这种罪行！

    周恩来同志对黄河问题严正声明
    蒋介石惨无人道堵口放水
    蓄意淹毙故道数百万军民
    紧急呼吁国内外人士及联总制止蒋介石这种罪行！
    【新华社延安八日电】周恩来将军现就黄河堵口问题，发表严正声明如下：
    目前陇海路东段内战正在异常紧张的时候，蒋介石政府突于上月底严令郑州军事当局及开封黄河堵复局，积极在花园口强行堵口放水，东淹黄河故道居民、两岸群众及解放区自卫部队。现泛水流已越过汴新路，不日即将经过济南东趋渤海。
    蒋介石政府这一惨无人道的残酷行为，在八年前决开花园口以来，已经泛滥了豫皖苏三省二万五千平方公里的土地，使六百多万人民遭受空前浩劫。现在又在黄河故道复堤工程尚未完成、险工取直尚未开始及故道居民尚未迁移之际，竟一面堵口、一面挖开故道引河，这将泛滥豫鲁两省若干万平方公里的土地，损失数百万人民的生命房屋财产。蒋介石之所以如此狠毒，其用心就在想利用黄河水势淹死豫鲁解放区的人民和部队，隔断解放区的自卫动员，破坏解放区的生产供给，好便于他的进攻和侵占，以达到他的军事目的。我们请求全国同胞国际正义人士，站在人道主义立场上，一致起来反对，紧急制止蒋介石政府这一凶毒的堵口放水行为！
    黄河堵复计划本来是联总支持的，为使八年来的泛滥区恢复原状，得到救济，我们基本上并不反对这一计划的实施。但同时，却坚持先修故道后堵决口的原则。因为决不能恢复了旧泛滥区而又制造了新泛滥区。故去年夏间我们与联总、行总及水利委员会曾订立过几次协议，每次都规定了进行黄河的复堤、险工裁湾取直及迁移居民等工作；同时上游堵口的准备工程必须与此相配合，不得抢先完成，堵口日期必须在上述工作全部完成之后。经三方（中共解放区、联总、行总）协议，始能决定。惟协议后，解放区政府虽严守协议，努力动员人民，于一月内完成复堤工程五分之四。但当时蒋介石政府却违犯协议，既不进行开封济南附近复堤工程，复拖欠我工款工粮至一月半之久。
    至八月，蒋介石政府进攻解放区的内战便实行大打了，黄河故道两岸解放区一切未完成未做的工程无法继续，一直停顿至今。可是，花园口堵口的准备工程，黄河堵复局竟不顾协议的约束，单独抢先进行，于去年十二月已完成全部工程，专等堵口放水的实施。故单从工程的见地上看来，下游工程复堤现未完成，整理险工及裁湾取直尚未开始，上游何能堵口放水？
    黄河故道在解放区内超过三分之二的地段，蒋介石政府规定复堤工款为六百六十亿，但付给解放区的才六十亿；故道居民六十余万，解放区要求至少拨款二百二十五亿作救济费，蒋介石政府虽于去年七月允先拨一百五十亿，但至今分文未给，币值亦已大跌，致故道居民无法迁移。
    综合各项事实，可见蒋介石政府在黄河堵复工程上所取的态度已经超过不公平的范围，而是自始至终都想以黄河归故来加害于解放区的人民和部队，以寻求其军事的目的。有时，因为国内外舆论所迫，不得不签订若干协定，规定一些款项，但转眼就不认账了！
    联总素以善后救济为工作方针的，但他的救济物资分配给黄河堵复工程上的各种机器工具及运输器材等，绝大部分都用在花园口工程上，而解放区复堤工程方面所得的几等于零。如果再将联总每次都参加黄河堵复问题协议，而每次又不去阻止蒋介石政府之违背协议的事情联系起来看，我们便不能不怀疑联总机构对于遵守“没有政治歧视”及“分配公平”的原则尚有几分真实。假使联总领导者欲证明其为真实，那我们就有权利要求联总中国分署在黄河堵复问题上采取公正而明确的态度，立即制止蒋介石政府目前堵口放水的行动，要求蒋介石政府和行总依照过去协定立即拨付解放区应得的全部工款工粮机器工具与运输器材及河道居民的全部救济费，并必须在复堤、整理、险工、裁湾取直全部工程完成之后，才能堵口放水。
    蒋介石政府如不服制止，不接受上述要求，联总有权停止对蒋介石政府的一切救济。而首先就应将花园口堵口工程上所用的机器工具船只及运输器材等全部撤走；这种合乎正义的压力，是中国人民所欢迎的。因为联总这些物资如不撤走，如不停止接济，中国将有数百万的人民受到损害。反之，这些人民才能得救。我谨代表解放区一亿四千万人民，向世界联总及联合各国的人民作此呼吁！
    数百万中国人民的生命财产将决定其存亡于最后一个短促的时期之内，望全国同胞全国舆论共起呼吁，急图挽救！
