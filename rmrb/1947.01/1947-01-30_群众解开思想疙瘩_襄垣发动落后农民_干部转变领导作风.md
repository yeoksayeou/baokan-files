    [This newspaper report] Xiangyuan County, during the deep-going movement in the twelfth lunar month, used methods such as "using bitterness to evoke bitterness," "touching hearts," and "comparing past suffering" to mobilize five types of backward peasants. Recently, the county's villages universally checked the degree of mass mobilization and discovered five types of backward peasants: First, poor and "honest peasants" and the elderly, whose thoughts are still limited by "conscience," "fate," and "favoritism." Second, those who fear change due to threats and enticements from special agents and landlords. Third, those who are dissatisfied with cadres (due to unfair distribution of fruits, cadres sheltering others) or whose problems have not been resolved. Fourth, poor women and immigrants who have always been neglected. Fifth, middle peasants who are afraid of struggle. In addition, there are some who belong to secret societies and the families of former puppet soldiers. These backward peasants create loopholes for landlords to spread rumors and engage in sabotage, and they serve as "air raid shelters" and "air vents" for hiding stolen goods. After understanding the situation, the leadership immediately proposed the policy of mobilizing all peasants to thoroughly defeat feudalism, letting the masses recognize that "if the landlords do not bow their heads, it is because they have backers around them," and that "the advanced and backward are one family, and unity is strength." They also put forward the slogan: "Unite the backward, eliminate the landlords' air raid shelters." On the one hand, they universally and separately convened座谈s with the above-mentioned types of people, using methods such as "using bitterness to evoke bitterness" and "touching the root of the disease" to enlighten their thoughts, and using collective discussion and comparison of similar households to make them realize "who will struggle against whom," so as to untie their ideological knots. On the other hand, they convened meetings of party branches, cadres, and activists to enlighten their class consciousness, initiated a "face-washing" movement for cadres, resolved problems such as unfair distribution of fruits and sheltering others, and transformed the bureaucratic and commanding style of some cadres. After the cadres made self-criticisms, they gained the understanding of the masses. Shi Laifu, chairman of the Nan Yao Farmers' Association, confessed that he had been corrupted and bought off by Han Hailong's wife, a landlord, and had leaked information. Initially, the masses were furious and wanted to beat him, but after discussion, everyone said, "If there weren't people wearing robes, there wouldn't be people holding up the hems." They became even more hateful of the scheming landlord, and forgave the cadres who had been poisoned. Many village cadres overcame their past commanding style and followed the mass line. As a result, the movement unfolded enthusiastically and universally in various villages, backward masses joined the struggle one after another, and they offered up many stolen goods that had been hidden for the landlords.

    群众解开思想疙瘩
    襄垣发动落后农民
    干部转变领导作风
    【本报讯】襄垣腊月深入运动中，用苦引苦、摸心并比时光等办法，发动了五种落后农民。最近该县各村普遍检查群众发动程度，发现有五种落后农民：一、贫苦的“老实农民”和老年人，他们的思想还限制在“良心”、“命运”、“情面”里面。二、受特务地主威胁利诱怕变天的。三、对干部不满（因果实分配不公，干部包庇）或提出问题未得解决的人。四、向来不被重视的贫苦妇女和外来户。五、怕斗争的中农。此外还有些是在会门道门的和伪军人员家属等，这些落后农民造成地主造谣破坏的空子，隐藏脏物的“防空洞”和“透气筒”。了解情况后，领导上即提出发动全体农民彻底打垮封建方针，让群众认识：“地主不低头，还是周围有靠头”，“先进落后是一家，团结起来力量大。”并提出：“团结落后，消灭地主防空洞”的口号。一方面普遍分别召集以上各种人座谈，用苦引苦、摸病根办法启发其思想，并用集体讨论和类同户比较方法，使其认识：“斗争谁，谁来斗争”，以解开其思想疙瘩；一方面又召开支部、干部积极分子会，启发其阶级自觉，发起干部洗脸运动，解决果实分配不公及包庇等问题，转变某些干部包办命令作风。干部检讨后，获得了群众谅解。南姚农会主席史来富坦白出因和地主韩海龙老婆腐化被收买透气的事情后，开始群众怒不可遏要打他，但经过讨论，大家都说：“没有穿袍子的就没有掂袍襟的人。”更加仇恨要阴谋的地主，而原谅了受毒害的干部。许多村干部克服了过去命令作风而走群众路线，结果各村运动热烈普遍展开，落后群众纷纷卷入斗争，并献出替地主隐藏的许多脏物。
