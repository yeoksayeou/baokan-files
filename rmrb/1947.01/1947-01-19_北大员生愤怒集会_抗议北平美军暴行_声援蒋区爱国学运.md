(This report) From our Changzhi correspondent:
　　To protest against the rape of a Peking University female student by U.S. troops in Beiping and to support the patriotic student movement in the Chiang-controlled areas, all faculty and students of Northern University here and all members of the Women's Issues Research Association of the Peking University Literary Association held an angry assembly on the 9th. President Zhang Zonglin, who had been ill for a month, also excitedly attended, despite his illness. The entire atmosphere was filled with outrage, and teachers and students unanimously condemned the atrocities of the U.S. military in China, demanding that the U.S. military immediately get out of China. President Fan Wenlan pointed out that this movement is a general outburst of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas against American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek.

　　He said: "Based on past experience, we know that every patriotic student movement is a reliable signal. Following this signal, a major event is bound to occur. One aspect of this event is to severely strike the dark forces of society; the other aspect is to greatly enhance and develop the revolutionary forces. The past 'May Fourth' Movement erupted in opposition to the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which sold out Chinese sovereignty to Japan; this movement overthrew the reactionary Duan Qirui government, and on the bright side, it gave birth to the Chinese Communist Party. The subsequent 'December 9th' Movement erupted under the severe situation in which the Chiang Kai-shek government sold out the three northeastern provinces and eastern Hebei and was about to sell out North China. The result of this movement was that, on the one hand, it forced the Chiang government to temporarily shelve its policy of civil war and national betrayal, and after the Xi'an Incident and the July 7th Incident, it was forced to resist Japan; on the other hand, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, through eight years of struggle, defeated Japan, and the revolutionary forces achieved unprecedented development, and the Chinese people took a big step towards a new China. This time, the patriotic student movement is also bound to be a signal. What will appear following this signal is the expulsion of the forces of American imperialism and all American troops from China, and the complete overthrow of the traitorous fascist government of Chiang Kai-shek; on the other hand, the revolutionary forces in China are bound to develop greatly. Chairman Mao said in his New Year's message: 'The sunshine of freedom must shine all over the motherland, and the new China of independence, peace, and democracy must lay a solid foundation in the next few years.' The meaning of the first sentence is that the new democratic revolution will achieve victory throughout the country. Chairman Mao's words are scientifically based. The signal of this fact is this national student movement." A female student said sadly: "We fought the Japanese invaders for eight years and exchanged our heads and blood for victory, but our victory was sold out by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, causing our male compatriots to be shot and our female compatriots to be raped. This is our great shame. We vow to oppose Chiang's traitorous civil war and oppose the stationing of U.S. troops in China..." Everyone said in unison: "In order to wash away this shame, we must work hard to help the peasants to emancipate themselves and strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. This is a powerful support for this great patriotic movement." The conference finally passed two temporary motions:
　　1. Send a telegram of condolence to the victimized students in Beiping, send a telegram to students in the Chiang-controlled areas and to American students and people and soldiers in the Chiang-controlled areas, calling on them to rise up and stop the atrocities of the U.S. military and urge the U.S. military to immediately withdraw from China, and send a telegram of condolence to the soldiers on the front lines of the Liberated Areas, and request Chairman Mao to convene a People's Representative Conference in the Liberated Areas.
　　2. During the winter vacation, go deep into the countryside to help the masses to emancipate themselves and earnestly launch a propaganda movement.

　　北大员生愤怒集会
    抗议北平美军暴行  声援蒋区爱国学运
    【本报长治讯】为抗议北平美军强奸北京大学女生，声援蒋管区学生爱国运动，此间北方大学全体教职学员及北大文联妇女问题研究会全体同仁于九日愤怒集会。卧病一月的张宗麟院长也兴奋的抱病参加，全场情绪愤慨异常，师生一致控诉美军在华暴行，要求美军立即滚出中国去。范文澜校长指出这一运动是蒋管区人民对美帝国主义者和蒋介石愤恨的总爆发。
    他说：“根据过去的经验，我们知道每一次的学生爱国运动就是一个可靠的信号，跟着这个信号必然要出现一件大事情，这件事情的一方面：是对社会的黑暗势力给以严重的打击；另一方面：是革命的力量大大的提高和发展。过去的“五四”运动是反对出卖中国主权给日本的巴黎和约的签字而爆发的；这一运动把反动的段祺瑞政府打下去了，在光明的方面是产生了中国共产党。接着的“一二、九”运动是在蒋介石政府出卖了东三省、冀东之后，又要出卖华北的严重局势下爆发的。这一运动的结果，一面压迫了蒋政府不能不暂时收起内战及卖国的政策，经双十二事件，七七事变而被迫抗战了；另一方面：是八路军新四军经八年的奋斗，把日本打垮了，革命的势力得到空前的发展，中国的人民向新的中国跨进了一大步。这一次的学生爱国运动，也必然是一个信号，跟着这信号而出现的将是把美帝国主义的势力，把美国的军队统统赶出中国去，把蒋介石的卖国法西斯政府彻底打垮；另一方面，中国革命的势力必然要大大的发展起来，毛主席在新年祝辞中说：“自由的阳光一定要照遍祖国的大地，独立和平民主的新中国一定要在今后数年内奠定稳固的基础。”头一句话的意思就是新民主主义革命要在全国范围内取得胜利。毛主席的话是有科学根据的。这一事实的信号，就是这一次的全国学生大运动。”一位女同学沉痛的说：“我们打了八年日寇，用头颅鲜血换来了胜利，但我们的胜利却被蒋介石卖国贼出卖了，致使我们的男同胞被枪杀，女同胞还被强奸，这是我们的奇耻大辱，我们誓死反对蒋贼的卖国内战，反对美军驻华……。”大家都异口同声的说：“为了洗雪这一耻辱，我们必须努力帮助农民翻身，争取爱国自卫战争的胜利。这就是对这一伟大爱国运动的有力支援。大会最后通过了临时动议两项：
    一、通电慰问北平受害学生，致电蒋管区学生及美国学生与蒋管区人民、蒋管区士兵呼吁群起制止美军暴行促使美军立即退出中国，并电慰解放区前线士兵，电请毛主席召开解放区人民代表大会。
    二、在寒假中深入农村帮助群众翻身切实展开宣传运动。
