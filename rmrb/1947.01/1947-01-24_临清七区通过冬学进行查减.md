　　[Weixian, 21st Dispatch] After the rent reduction campaign was deployed in the Seventh District of Linqing, it was emphasized that village cadres should act as teachers to lead and control the Winter School, and conduct rent reduction through the Winter School. In Sanlizhuang, the policy towards middle peasants was explained in the Winter School, clearing up the middle peasants' fear of rising and fear of struggle. All 32 middle peasant households in the village participated in the farmers' association. Tian Jin-yu's family in Tianzhuang was doing well, and in the past, they were afraid of struggle. At the Winter School discussion meeting, he said: "We didn't open the flour mill because we were afraid of struggle. Now we know that we have to work hard." Now Tian Jin-yu has joined the farmers' association, and the flour mill has reopened. Daying Village explained the spirit of democracy in the Winter School, and after group deliberation, launched a democratic discussion. A joint representative committee was established, resolving sectarian conflicts and smoothly completing the rent reduction. After the rent reduction in Yaoshan, some backward masses expressed doubts after the distribution of the fruits of struggle. Some said: "Although we have houses and land, I am afraid it will not last long." Some masses who were allocated houses said: "Live one day at a time." When the cadres heard these words, they immediately raised the questions of "How to defend the fruits?" "Who is stronger, the Kuomintang or the Communist Party?" and "Who will win and who will lose?" in the Winter School. Everyone spoke one after another and discussed for four days. Only then did they figure it out ideologically, and unanimously realized that defending the gains depends entirely on their own strength. They also discussed many things, such as joining the army, supporting the war effort, preparing for war, and preventing special agents. The Winter School education was well integrated with the current tasks.
    [News Dispatch] The Third District of Jize has universally established Winter Schools, with more than 3,800 students. They have combined sideline production and organized 28 production groups, including transportation, salt lye, sales, manure collection, and firewood collection groups, laying the foundation for the upcoming large-scale production movement. In Qian Wangtan Village, Zaoqiang, according to the different levels of the students, they were divided into several groups to encourage storytelling, talk about liberation, and discuss issues.

　　临清七区通过冬学进行查减
    【本报威县二十一日电】临清七区查减运动布置后，即强调各村干部充当教员，领导与掌握冬学，通过冬学进行查减。三里庄在冬学里讲了中农政策，打通了中农怕上升怕斗争的思想，全村三十二家中农都参加了农会。田庄田金玉家过的很好，过去光怕斗争，在冬学小组讨论会上说：“咱因怕斗争，粉坊也不开了，现在可知道了，得好好的干”。现田金玉参加了农会，粉坊又开了门。大营村在冬学里讲解了民主精神，经小组酝酿，展开民主讨论。建立了联合代表委员会，解决了宗派矛盾，顺利的完成了查减。尧山经过查减，分配斗争果实后，有些落后群众表示怀疑，有的说：“房屋土地虽然有了，恐怕长久不了”；有个别分房子的群众说：“住一天算一天”，干部听到这些话，马上在冬学里提出“怎样保卫果实”，“国民党，共产党谁的力量大？”和“谁胜谁败？”大家你一言我一语的发言，一直讨论了四天。才在思想上弄通了，一致认识了保卫既得果实，完全靠自己的力量。并讨论了许多事情，如参军、优抗、备战、防特等，冬学教育与当前任务结合很好。
    【本报讯】鸡泽三区普遍成立了冬学，学员达三千八百余人。他们结合副业生产，组织了二十八个生产小组，内有运输、淋盐、贩卖、拾粪、拾柴等组，为即将到来的大生产运动打下基础。枣强前王滩村根据学员的不同的程度，编成若干小组，启发讲故事，谈翻身，讨论问题。
