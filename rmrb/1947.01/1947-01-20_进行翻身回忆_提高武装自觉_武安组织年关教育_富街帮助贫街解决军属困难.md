　　[This Newspaper Reports] The Wu'an leading organs are actively organizing mass education work for the Lunar New Year. The main content is reminiscences of emancipation, comparisons between the old and new times, and activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers, solidarity movements, and armed awareness movements. On New Year's Eve, taking advantage of the time when the whole family is making dumplings, reminiscences of emancipation and comparisons of the times are carried out universally on a family basis, combined with the current in-depth movement. From the first to the fifth day of the New Year, one is to use the group worship opportunity to carry out mass mobilization work, encouraging everyone to continue to thoroughly emancipate themselves; second, to pay New Year's calls and condolences to the families of revolutionary martyrs, disabled soldiers, and stationed troops, to solve the difficulties of military families, and to enhance the solidarity between military families and the masses. Third, farmers who have disagreements due to minor matters will automatically help each other resolve the problems. Fourth, during visits with relatives, they will visit each other to talk about the times and encourage each other to thoroughly emancipate themselves. From the fifth day to the Lantern Festival, there will be a period of education to protect emancipation and enhance armed awareness, combined with the task of preparing for war. Villages that are in the midst of struggle will still focus on the struggle, so that it will not be interrupted by the New Year. Educational institutions and schools have compiled many couplets comparing the old and new times and encouraging emancipation and self-defense for various places to adopt. (Dong)

　　[This Newspaper Wu'an News] Outside the Shagoumen gate of Wu'an City, there are more than 40 military families. Because there are many poor households in the street, they cannot take care of them. The wealthy streets automatically supported and gave 600,000 yuan to the street to provide preferential treatment to military families. The military families felt that if this money was spent, it would trouble the masses again, so they took the opportunity to raise 450,000 yuan and bought two cotton gins. On the 7th, they also established a military family flower room to seek self-sufficiency in production. The cotton gins are running day and night, and the military families are in high spirits for production. At the end of the year, the account was settled, and a dividend of 466,000 yuan was earned. After consumption, the net profit was 215,000 yuan. During the New Year, half of the profits were withdrawn to solve the problem of burning coal for each military family. The military families were all so happy that they could not close their mouths. It was decided to increase investment this year to buy two more cotton gins to expand production. (Fu Cang)

    【本报武安讯】武安城沙沟门外，有军属四十余户，该街贫户多照顾不过来，富街自动拥护给该街优待军属款六十万元。军属们认为如将这款花完，又要麻烦群众，就乘机集资四十五万元，买了两辆轧花车，七日并创办一军属花房，以谋生产自给。轧花车日夜不停地转动，军属们生产情绪极高。年底结账，赚了红利四十六万六千元。除消费外，净赚二十一万五千元。年关中将红利抽出二分之一，解决了每家军属的烧煤问题。军属们都喜得合不拢嘴。决定今年再增资买花车二辆以扩大生产。（复仓）
