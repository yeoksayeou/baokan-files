    Shattering the Long-Term Rule of Enemy, Puppet, Stubborn Elements, Miscellaneous Evildoers, and Landlord Tyrants
    Xiajin Completes Land Reform
    Laboring Peasants Achieve Political and Economic Advantages, Achieving Complete Liberation
    Landlords Return Land to Peasants, Extreme Poverty Has Been Completely Eliminated
    Feudal Armed Forces Disarmed, Peasants Armed Themselves
    [Report from this newspaper] Xiajin was a place long ruled by enemy, puppet, stubborn elements, miscellaneous evildoers, and landlord tyrants. Relying on the power of the enemy, they used various open and covert methods to extort and suck the blood and sweat of the peasants in the countryside. They used official ginneries to forcibly buy peasants' cotton at low prices; they used village rule to impose all or most of the enemy and puppet burdens on the peasants (while they contributed little or nothing); they wrote all their lavish spending and waste on the village accounts under the pretext of official duties and had the peasants share the burden. Especially in famine years, relying on their money and power, they massively bought peasants' land, houses, furniture, and labor at low prices. In situations of hunger and cold, peasants had to pay money to the landlords even when working for them. Since the liberation by the Eighth Route Army, after last year's struggle to increase capital and redeem land, the mass movement to widely oppose traitorous, evil, feudal landlords was not promptly launched. Therefore, the feudal rule of evil landlords in the countryside was not fundamentally shaken. For example, in the first district, except for three villages that were relatively good, the remaining 142 villages, and in the seventh district, 56 villages, were almost entirely controlled by feudal forces. They used their positions to control the joint defense teams, village governments, and even peasant associations. In order to suppress the masses, they first threatened the activists leading the peasants by beating and killing them. Almost every evil landlord had several blood debts on their hands. After the land reform team cadres arrived in the area, the evil landlords, fearing that the masses and activists would approach the land reform team, used threats, rumors, and surveillance to keep the masses away. For example, in the sixth district, a person in × Village who said a word to a cadre was interrogated at home by a feudal lackey; the village chief (landlord's lackey) of ××× Village in the seventh district said to the masses: "Whoever speaks to the people from the land reform team will either 'see Tianjin Wei' (i.e., be thrown into the canal) or be covered with a purple quilt (i.e., be buried alive)"; a village in the seventh district even spread the rumor: "The young women who join the women's association now will each be taken away by one of the land reform team when they leave." No matter how fierce and cunning the evil landlords were, they could not stop the long-accumulated hatred of the broad masses of peasants and their rebellious anger demanding liberation. Facts have also proven that since the land reform team arrived in Xiajin on September 1st, with the active work and full support of local cadres, after three months, the bloody rule of traitorous, evil, and feudal forces was defeated, and the laboring people have been liberated from the old feudal rule and have become the new masters. If we take the mobilization of the masses, the defeat of feudal rule, the elimination of feudal exploitation, the solution of the peasants' land problem, the unity of 90% of the laboring people, and the establishment of the superiority of the laboring peasants in the countryside as standards for inspection, we can say that this great historical task has been completed. From an economic point of view, in the 122 villages in the four districts of Xiajin, namely, the first, second, sixth, and seventh districts, there were a total of 288 landlord households. Except for seven households in the first district who were still maintained as landlords because they were old, weak, orphaned, or widowed, the remaining 280 households have all changed their class status. Most of the landlords were downgraded to middle peasants and wealthy middle peasants (the statistics for those downgraded to rich peasants is 30 households). In the twenty-three villages of the first district, thirty landlord households returned 85% of their original land to the peasants. In the thirty-three villages of the seventh district, seventy-six landlord households returned 62% of their original land to the peasants. In addition to reclaiming land from the hands of the feudal rulers, the peasants also recovered a considerable amount of materials. The economic status of the laboring peasants has been greatly improved. In the eighty-five villages of the first and second districts, there were originally 661 households living in extreme poverty. Except for Qiao Guantun, a particularly poor village with 30 households still living in extreme poverty, all the rest have been eliminated. In the forty-eight villages of the second district, there were originally 2,789 poor peasant households. After the movement, 1,242 households were upgraded to middle peasants, and even those who remained poor peasants greatly improved their past poverty. In the twenty-four villages of the first district, each person received an average of 1.5 to 4.5 mu of land and an average of 12,999 yuan worth of materials. In the fifty-eight villages of the second district, each person received 1.3 to 4 mu of land. After the peasants received a large amount of land and materials, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and the wealth of the countryside greatly increased. From a political point of view: all villages have launched struggles against traitorous, evil, and feudal landlords. Those in charge in the countryside are no longer traitorous, evil, and feudal landlords, but peasants who have been liberated through struggle. The peasant associations and women's associations have become the decisive force in various activities in the countryside. The activists who have been liberated have become the core of all activities in the countryside. The village governments that used to serve feudal forces have been largely transformed. For example, in the fourth sub-district of the seventh district, eight out of nine village chiefs have been replaced, and village administration committees have been established. These village chiefs and committee members are mostly activists in the peasant associations. In the statistics of 30 villages in the first district, except for one village that has not yet been re-elected, the village chiefs and village administration committee members in 29 villages have been replaced by activists from the peasant associations. In mass organizations such as peasant associations and women's associations, after putting forward the work of full mobilization and in-depth consolidation, emphasis was placed on establishing collective leadership, establishing committees, establishing democratic style and democratic system, and emphasizing uniting 90% of the masses. In ten villages in the first district, with a population of 5,009, the number of peasant women members totaled 2,600, accounting for more than 51% of the total population. If children are excluded, it accounts for 80-90% of the population. In 59 villages in the second district, there are a total of 29,759 people, with 11,351 people in organized mass organizations, accounting for 37.8% of the total population. The laboring peasants have established their own superiority in the countryside. From an armed point of view: after the great liberation movement of the peasants entered its climax, most of the armed forces that hindered the great movement of the masses and suppressed the masses were disarmed by the masses and used to arm themselves. Some places stipulated that only members of the peasant association are qualified to participate in the militia, and they can participate in the militia only with the approval of the peasant association. The militia captain is appointed by the armed committee member of the peasant association and is led by the peasant association. The rural armed forces have been largely controlled by the laboring peasants, and personnel from the puppet army and puppet organizations have been largely purged from the militia. The results of more than three months of work have basically defeated feudal rule and solved the land problem. However, in the first district, there are still a few backward villages and some small villages that have not been mobilized or have not been fully mobilized, and the enemy's armed agents can still use the gaps to carry out activities. In the second district, there are still 20 villages where only a few activists have been active in the past, and it has not yet become a truly mass movement of their own. These villages need to be re-mobilized. In addition, these evil and deeply rooted traitorous, evil, and feudal forces will not give up after this struggle. They will inevitably look for every opportunity to counterattack the masses. In fact, some people are still conducting secret activities to this day, and a considerable number of traitorous, evil, and runaway elements have not bowed their heads to the masses. There are still some people among the masses who lack confidence in the victory of the revolution. What is particularly important is that the masses do not yet have a set of mature ruling experiences. For example, in the first and seventh districts, it was discovered that the masses were willing to have windfall gains but not land. In addition, the hidden armed forces of the feudal forces have not been completely eliminated, as well as certain shortcomings in our leadership organization and cadres themselves. Therefore, consolidating the gains and consolidating the superiority of the laboring people in the countryside is still a very arduous and serious task.

    粉碎敌伪顽杂恶霸地主长期统治
    夏津完成土地改革
    劳动农民从政治上经济上获得优势达到完全翻身
    地主退还农民土地赤贫业已全部消灭
    解除了封建武装农民武装了自己
    【本报讯】夏津是敌伪杂顽恶霸地主长年统治的地方，他们在农村凭着敌人势力，曾用了各种公开和隐蔽的办法敲诈和吸吮农民的血汗。利用开官轧房强制贱价收买农民的棉花；利用村统治把敌伪负担全部或大部加在农民的身上（自己少出或不出）；把自己的胡吃胡喝胡干花消，借口应差而全部写在村里账上由农民摊派，特别在灾荒年仗着自己有钱有势，大量的贱价收买农民土地房屋和家具，以及农民的劳动力，在饥寒交迫的情况下，农民给地主做活还得倒贴钱。自八路军解放后，经过去年增资赎地的斗争，因没及时把增资赎地运动转入广泛的反对汉奸恶霸封建地主的群众运动，因此恶霸地主在农村的封建统治基本上没有动摇；比如在一区除三个村较好外，其余一百四十二个村、七区五十六个村几乎全部仍为封建势力所掌握，他们利用自己地位控制联防队、村公所、甚至农会等。为了镇压群众，首先对领导农民的积极分子，采取了毒打和杀害来威胁。绝大部分恶霸地主那一个也背着几条人命血案。当翻身队的干部到该地之后，他们害怕群众和积极分子接近翻身队，用威胁造谣监视的办法使群众远离。如六区×屯一个人给干部说了一句话，就有封建的狗腿到他家去盘问；七区×××村村长（地主狗腿）向群众说：“谁和翻身队的人说话：一是‘天津卫见’（即投到运河里），一是盖紫花被子（即活埋）”；七区某村还造这种谣言：“现在参加妇女会的青年妇女，将来翻身队走时，一人带一个走。”不管恶霸地主怎样凶狠狡猾，但总不会阻挡住广大农民多年积蓄的仇恨和要求翻身的反抗怒火。事实也证明，自九月一号翻身队到达夏津，在当地干部积极工作全力支持之下，经过三个月的时间，汉奸恶霸封建势力的血腥统治被打垮了，劳动人民已经从旧的封建统治下解放出来，并成了新的主人。如果拿发动群众、打垮封建统治、消灭封建剥削、解决农民土地问题、团结百分之九十的劳动人民、树立劳动农民在农村的优势作标准来检查，可以说业已完成了这伟大的历史任务。从经济上看，在夏津一、二、六、七四个区一百二十二个村中，共有地主二百八十八户，除一区有七户因是老弱孤寡仍维持地主成份者外，其余二百八十户均已改变了成份。地主大部分降为中农和富裕中农（降富农的统计有三十户）。一区二十三个村有三十户地主，将其原有土地的百分之八十五归还了农民。七区三十三个村中的七十六户地主，将其原有土地的百分之六十二归还了农民。农民们在封建统治手里除要回土地外，还要回了相当大的一批物资。劳动农民的经济地位已大大提高，在一、二两区八十五个村庄中原有六百六十一户赤贫，除乔官屯一个特别贫困的村庄尚有三十户赤贫外，业已全部消灭。二区四十八个村庄中原有贫农二千七百八十九户，运动后上升为中农者一千二百四十二户，就是仍为贫农的人也大大改善了过去的贫困。一区二十四个村中每人平均补到一亩半至四亩半土地，每人分得物资平均一万二千九百九十九元。二区五十八个村庄中土地每人补到一亩三至四亩。农民在得到大量土地与物资之后，生产情绪空前提高，农村的财富大大增加。从政治上看：全部村庄已经都向汉奸恶霸封建地主进行斗争。农村中管事的已不是汉奸恶霸封建地主，而是斗争中翻了身的农民。农会妇会已成为农村各种活动的决定力量。翻身的积极分子已成为农村一切活动的核心。过去为封建势力服务的村公所已大部改造。例如七区四小区九个村长已换了八个，均已建立了村政委员会，这些村长与委员多半是农会中的积极分子。一区卅个村庄的统计中，除一个村还没有改选外，廿九个村庄的村长和村政委员都换成了农会的积极分子。在农会妇会等群众组织中从提出充分发动与深入巩固工作后，即强调了建立集体领导、建立委员会、建立民主的作风与民主制度，强调团结百分之九十的群众。一区十个村五千零九口人农妇会员合计二千六百人，占全人口百分之五十一强，如除去儿童就占人口的百分之八、九十，二区五十九个村共有二万九千七百五十九人，有组织的群众一万一千三百五十一人，占总人口的百分之卅七点八。劳动农民在农村中已建立了自己的优势。从武装上来看：农民的翻身大运动进入高潮之后，妨碍群众大动镇压群众的武装大部分已被群众解除，并用以武装了自己，有的地方规定农会员才有参加民兵的资格，经过农会的批准才能参加民兵，民兵队长由农会武装委员来担任，受农会的领导，农村的武装已经大部掌握在劳动农民手里，伪军伪组织人员已由民兵中大部清洗出去。三个多月的工作结果，基本上已打垮封建统治，解决土地问题。但在一区还有几个落后村和一部分小村没有发动起来或发动的不充分，敌人的武装特务还能利用空隙进行活动。二区还有二十个村庄过去只是少数积极分子的活动，还没有成为真正广大群众自己的运动，这些村庄还需要重新发动。另外这些积恶成性的汉奸恶霸封建势力经过这次斗争之后，是不会死心的，他们必然要寻找一切机会向群众反攻，事实也有些人至今还在秘密进行活动，还有相当大的一批汉奸恶霸逃亡在外，并没有向群众低头。在群众中还有一部分人对革命的胜利信心不足，特别重要的是群众还没有一套成熟的统治经验，例如一区、七区都发现群众愿要浮财不愿要地。另外封建势力的隐蔽武装还没有最后肃清，及我们领导组织与干部本身的某些缺陷，因此巩固既得利益巩固劳动人民在农村的优势，还是一件非常艰巨而严重的任务。
