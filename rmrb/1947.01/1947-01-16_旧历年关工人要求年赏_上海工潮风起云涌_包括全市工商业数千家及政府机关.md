Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 12th: (Based on Shanghai newspaper reports) Labor strikes are surging in Shanghai. By the end of last month, thousands of factories, stores, and businesses, large and small, were involved, encompassing most of the city's important enterprises, and even affecting government agencies. In the silk weaving industry alone, over 200 factories staged slowdowns, and workers in another 200+ factories were preparing to take unified action to demand year-end bonuses. The more than 500 workers at the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, China's first large-scale pharmaceutical enterprise, were owed wages for the entire month of November and half a month in December because the factory was 2 billion in debt. The workers were requesting the payment of wages while simultaneously preventing creditors from removing equipment from the factory, and were planning to organize a factory support committee to try to save the factory from collapse. Employees of the Sino-American Hospital demanded improved benefits, and employees of its dance hall demanded year-end bonuses. Because the management refused excessively, all of the hospital's labor force adopted a new form of protest called "treating guests," meaning that the former only saw patients and the latter only entertained people to dance, all free of charge. Currently, the Sino-American Hospital management has agreed to the demand for 500,000 yuan per person for winter clothing expenses, and other conditions may also be permitted. Other enterprises and units involved in the labor strike, with workers demanding year-end bonuses, include the city's textile industry (including the Chiang government's China Textile Corporation), flour industry, machinery industry, cigarette industry (including Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Yee Tsoong Tobacco Co., Hua Cheng Tobacco Co., China Tobacco Company, Yuan Hua Tobacco Co., and other major cigarette factories), the paper industry in the fourth and fifth districts, the department store industry in the third district, the China Textile Corporation Shanghai Third Machinery Factory, Jiangnan Shipyard, Sincere Company, Yongtong Iron Factory, American United Shipyard, American Light Match Factory, etc. Workers demanding improved benefits include those in various Western-style clothing businesses and the French-owned Water and Electricity Company. Employees of the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai Railway Police Departments also demanded year-end bonuses, and employees of the Municipal Government demanded adjustments to their benefits.
