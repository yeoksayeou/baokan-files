    Wuyi County in Jinnan Province, during the land reform and review campaign, achieved significant results because new and veteran activists engaged in mutual self-criticism and united closely. This allowed them to grasp the correct principle of "uniting the majority and isolating the landlords" in the movement. After reviewing their past undemocratic styles, the new and veteran activists in the First District resolved to "unite the majority of the masses in action, practice democracy, avoid taking over everything, avoid struggling against middle peasants, resolutely eliminate feudal forces, and enable the masses to completely turn over." New cadre Li ×× reviewed his past fear of hurting feelings, which prevented him from resolutely struggling against the landlords. He said, "I now know that if we don't 'tear faces,' the suffering of the basic masses cannot be poured out, let alone turn their lives around thoroughly. In the future, I will definitely not be polite and will resolutely fight the landlords to the end." Activists in the Fifth District clarified the class divisions and unanimously recognized that "whoever struggles against the middle peasants commits a serious mistake." New and veteran activists in the Chengguan District, based on the attitude of "whatever knots there are, untie them," first brainstormed separately and resolved internal disputes. Then, they worked closely together, explaining the policies to the masses repeatedly, stabilizing the emotions of the middle peasants. Within five or six days, the entire Chengguan District had united more than 80 percent of the peasants. Other streets have formally established land reform committees; the masses are managing and educating traitors and puppet personnel, urging them to confess and start anew. Currently, the masses in each street have been organized and are repeatedly digging out the roots of poverty and pouring out their grievances. In Fu Village, under the coordination of new and veteran activists, more than 160 male and female peasants joined the association in less than a day. In the Fourth District, most villages completed the coordination work within half a month, and more than 90 percent of the peasants swore to join the peasant association.

    武邑新老积极分子互相检讨
    增强了团结群众力量
    【本报讯】冀南武邑县在翻身大检查中，由于新老积极分子相互检讨亲密团结，在运动中掌握了“团结多数，孤立地主”的正确方针，使运动获得显著成绩。一区新老积极分子检讨了过去不民主的作风后，决心今后“在行动中团结大多数群众，实行民主，不包办，不斗中农，坚决消灭封建势力，使群众彻底翻身”。新干部李××检讨了自己过去怕伤情面，不敢坚决向地主斗争，他说：“我现在知道不抓破脸，受苦的基本群众就不能倒苦水，更不能翻透身。以后一定不客气，坚决和地主斗到底。”五区积极分子明确了阶层划分，一致认识到“谁斗了中农，谁就犯严重错误。”城关区的新老积极分子本着“有啥疙瘩，解啥疙瘩”的态度，先分头酝酿，解决了内部纠纷，然后紧密结合，分头向群众反复解释政策，稳定了中农情绪，五六天内，全城关已团结了百分之八十以上的农民。其他各街均正式成立了翻身委员会；对于汉奸与伪人员均由群众加以管理教育，促其坦白自新。现各街群众均已组织起来，正反复挖穷根倒苦水。傅庄在新老积极分子的串连下，不到一天功夫，即有一百六十名男女农民入会。四区大部村庄在半月内，已完成串连工作，百分之九十以上的农民都宣誓加入了农会。
