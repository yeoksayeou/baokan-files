　　[This newspaper Taiyue Second Day Electric] On New Year's Day, all circles in Taiyue held a New Year's get-together to celebrate victory. Yangcheng was filled with excitement and joy on that day. Peasants who had been liberated were dressed in bright clothes and paid New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao early in the morning from afar. The liberated peasants performed large and small Yangge dances to celebrate this joyous New Year. At noon, a meeting was held. The chairman reported the victory of the Eighth Route Army in recovering Yicheng on New Year's Day. The whole audience cheered and applauded for a long time. After the New Year's greetings, Director Niu of the Administrative Office, Comrade Li Zheren of the District Party Committee, and Director Gui of the Military Region Political Department spoke, calling on the military and civilians of the entire region to strive to achieve the four major tasks. Then, everyone took an oath to resolutely eliminate the attacking enemy.
    [This newspaper Taiyue First Day Electric] Taiyue Xinhua Daily published a New Year's message in its New Year's supplement, first making a simple summary of the mass movement and the patriotic self-defense war in the past year. In terms of the mass movement: it is necessary to boldly lead the masses to carry out land reform, truly follow the mass line, unify organization, concentrate forces, and combine the mass movement with the war. In terms of the self-defense war: mobilizing the masses to carry out land reform is the fundamental factor in winning the self-defense war. Resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's policy of concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy's effective strength one by one is the guarantee of winning battles. Overcoming the peace thoughts towards the US-Chiang clique, improving combat will and confidence in victory, and widely carrying out mass guerrilla warfare are indispensable conditions for winning the entire self-defense war. Then, it put forward the four major tasks for the entire region in 1947: First, strive to complete land reform throughout the region before the spring plowing. This task is still the central task for the entire region's party, government, army, and people. At present, it is necessary to conduct a thorough review of the emancipation, and specifically carry out filling in the gaps and making up for deficiencies. Second, strive for our army to quickly turn to counter-offensive. To this end, we must continue to implement Chairman Mao's operational policy of concentrating superior forces and annihilating the enemy's effective strength one by one; we must seize all favorable opportunities to carry out local counter-offensives, and actively form new and greater forces; we must further carry out the mass guerrilla warfare against the counter-reckoning of the die-hards; we must universally launch a kill-the-enemy-and-perform-meritorious-service campaign, actively look for opportunities to kill and wound the enemy; we must do a good job in logistics; we must respond to the call of Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, and thoroughly overcome peace illusions. Third, carry out a large-scale production movement, practice thrift, advocate building a family and starting a business, getting rich, working hard, cherishing the people's strength, saving the people's strength, and laying the material foundation for victory. Fourth, strengthen various organizational work, such as the development, consolidation, rectification, and education of local party organizations and the consolidation and reorganization of the militia.
