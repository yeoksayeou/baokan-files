    The Land Leveling and Replenishing Movement in the Taihang Old Liberated Area is Now Shifting to an In-Depth Stage
    [This newspaper's Changzhi 24th dispatch] Taihang Branch Agency reporter reports: The land leveling and replenishing movement in the Taihang Old Liberated Area has entered an in-depth stage after two months of effort. In Pingshun, Licheng, Shexian, Linxian, and other places, apart from some villages that entered winter production at the beginning of this month, most villages are carrying out fruit distribution and in-depth investigation of remaining issues. In Wu'xiang, Xiangyuan, Lingchuan, and other places, they are in the midst of a high tide of sweeping away feudal remnants and recovering land. Pingshun County can complete the distribution of fruits before the Lunar New Year, so that the masses will not be concerned and delay production. It is said that many farmers do not have a sufficient understanding of the legality of land recovery. In addition to strengthening ideological education, after the distribution of land and houses, legal procedures should be given immediately, old contracts should be burned and new contracts should be established. In addition to a blitz of fruit distribution, Licheng has also launched a county-wide in-depth inspection movement. The inspection focuses on two aspects: one is to carefully check whether the feudal remnants have been completely swept away. This movement is being carried out enthusiastically in Nanweiquan Village, District One, and other villages in the county, and it has been found that landlords are using the relationships of backward relatives and neighbors to hide large amounts of land and property. Ideological education is now being strengthened to encourage self-reporting. The masses call it digging the landlords' "air-raid shelters." The other is to check whether "deficit households," especially military families, retired soldiers, and the extremely poor, have been replenished; whether the masses have obtained enough land and have completely turned over. Villages with a shortage of land are now partially immigrating to wealthier villages, mainly relocating retired soldiers and migrant residents to settle down. In Shexian, Linxian, and some districts and villages in Wu'xiang and Xiangyuan where the movement has been deepened, this type of inspection is also being carried out. In villages where Pingshun and Licheng have ended, ideological education is being strengthened through winter schools, leading the masses to calculate their liberation accounts, raise their awareness, and educate them to cherish their fruits and turn to production. Judging from the situation in the entire region, the issues in the in-depth stage can include: 1. Thoroughly check the hidden tails of landlords and check whether deficit households have been replenished. 2. Lead the masses to summarize the movement, raise awareness, and turn to production. 3. Guarantee the land rights and property rights of liberated farmers.
    [This newspaper's Wu'xiang dispatch] The Wu'xiang Old Liberated Area's movement to implement the policy of mobilizing backward elements and uniting middle peasants by investigating and reducing rents is developing rapidly. The villages of Tuhe in District Two, Dayou in District Three, and Wulu in District Four have all launched movements to pour out grievances and settle accounts. Dayou and other villages are advanced areas that have undergone the rent reduction movement in 1942, and countless farmers are still pouring out their pent-up grievances of many years. The First and Sixth Districts both launched a thorough tail-cutting movement after a general outpouring of grievances. In order to implement the mobilization of backward elements and eliminate feudalism, the county party committee specifically pointed out: when the high tide of the movement arrives, do not ignore mountain villages and small villages, and mobilize activists to face backward elements. After in-depth investigation, Panlong studied the root causes of why 25 backward masses had not turned over; except for five households, 20 households did not benefit from several rent reductions because they did not have tenancy issues, and five households were dissatisfied with the village cadres and were unwilling to speak up for a long time. The leadership specially called them to a meeting, and finally inspired them to pour out their grievances and turn over. In areas where the movement is deepening, some poor villages or villages where landlords have been eliminated but there are still extremely poor people who have not been allocated land are demanding that everything be leveled, but in order to take care of the liberation of poor villages and implement the policy of uniting middle peasants and taking care of new rich peasants, the leadership, in addition to conducting education that all farmers under heaven are one family and not to struggle against middle peasants, organized joint struggles of linked defense villages, advocated that everyone turn over, and appropriately adjusted and took care of the liberation of farmers in poor villages, achieving great unity among the farmers.

    太行老区填补运动
    刻正转向深入阶段
    【本报长治廿四日电】太行分社记者报导：太行老区的填平补齐运动经两月努力已至深入阶段。平顺、黎城、涉县、林县等，除部分村庄于本月初转入冬季生产外，大部村庄正进行果实分配与深入清查遗留问题。武乡、襄垣、陵川等地则正在扫清封建残余、收回土地的高潮中。平顺全县在旧历年关以前可把果实分配完毕，使群众不致有所牵挂延误生产。据称：不少农民对收回土地的合法性认识不足，除加强思想教育外，土地、房屋分配后，应立即给以合法手续，焚毁旧契另立新契。黎城除突击果实分配外，又掀起全县规模的深入检查运动；检查分两方面：其一为细致检查封建残余是否已彻底扫清，这一运动在该县一区南委泉等村热烈展开，发现地主利用落后亲友、邻居关系隐藏大批土地财物。现正加强思想教育，发动自报。群众呼之为挖地主的“防空洞”。另一为检查“窟窿户”，特别是军属、荣退军人、赤贫等是否已经填平；群众是否获得了足够的土地，彻底翻了身。土地缺少村庄现在向富村作部分的移民，主要是迁移安家的荣退军人与客民。涉、林等县及武、襄等县部分运动已深入的区、村，亦正进行此种检查。平、黎两县已结束的村庄现正从冬学中加强思想教育，领导群众算翻身账，提高觉悟，并教育其爱护果实转向生产。就全区情况看，深入阶段的问题可包括：一、彻底检查地主的隐蔽尾巴与检查窟窿户是否填平。二、领导群众总结运动，提高觉悟，并转向生产。三、保障翻身农民的地权与财权。
    【本报武乡讯】武乡老区查减贯彻发动落后团结中农方针，运动迅速开展。二区土河、三区大有、四区吴禄等村均掀起了诉苦算账运动。大有等村是经过四二年减租运动的先进区，无数农民仍倾吐出积压多年的苦水。一、六两区均在普遍诉苦高潮后，展开彻底割尾巴运动。为了贯彻发动落后，肃清封建，县委特指出：在运动高潮到来时候，不要忽视山庄小村，动员积极分子面向落后。蟠龙经过深入调查，研究二十五户落后群众没翻身的根源；除五户外，有二十户因没租佃问题，几次减租均没得到利益，有五户对村干不满，长期不愿吭声。领导上特别召集他们开会，终于启发他们倒出苦水，翻起身来。在运动深入开展地区，有些贫苦村或地主已消灭而尚有赤贫未分得土地的村庄群众，要求一律推平，但领导上为了照顾贫村翻身，并贯彻团结中农照顾新富农方针，除了进行天下农民是一家，不斗中农教育外，组织了联防村的联合斗争，提倡大家翻身，适当的调剂和照顾贫村农民的翻身问题，做到了农民大团结。
