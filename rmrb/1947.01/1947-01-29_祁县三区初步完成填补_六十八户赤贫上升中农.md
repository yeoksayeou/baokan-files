    【This Dispatch from Our Changzhi Bureau on the 26th】The Third District of Qixian County, located on the eastern side of the northern section of the Baijin Road, has achieved preliminary victory in land reform. The majority of villages in this district were only liberated from the heavy oppression of the Yan puppet regime in September of last year. After liberation, the democratic government first implemented emergency relief, and then immediately distributed the land of the major traitors who had committed many evils to the poor peasants, thus inspiring the masses to carry out anti-traitor liquidation. However, due to the improper distribution of fruits (whoever raised objections got a share) and insufficient ideological mobilization (mainly the failure to overcome the "things will change" mentality), this movement was always limited to a small number of people. In November, after self-criticism by the district leadership, they first trained 160 activists from eight villages and cultivated 37 core cadres. After these activists returned to their villages, they closely monitored the local bullies and landlords, while conducting extensive mobilization among the masses, putting forward concise mobilization slogans: "Tell your grievances, demand land, rely on struggle to turn over, struggle relies on strength, the poor seek the poor, the miserable seek the miserable, sesame candy sticks to sesame seeds, the more you stick, the greater the strength." After the mobilization, small-scale grievance-telling sessions were launched, clarifying the targets of struggle, and then large-scale struggle meetings were promptly conducted. The district also boldly supported and took charge. Therefore, the movement developed rapidly and fiercely. Within a short month, over a hundred evil bullies and landlords were overthrown, and peasants recovered a large amount of land and property. The distribution of fruits followed the principle of filling the gaps and making up for deficiencies. Statistics from five villages showed that out of 724 households, 520 households received fruits, and 68 impoverished households were elevated to middle peasant status. The vast majority of poor peasants also rose. Mass organizations have been established, with 665 members in peasant associations in five villages, 91 militiamen, and new activists have emerged, totaling 194 men and women. The district's New Year summary of the movement concluded that it had only initially achieved "land to the tiller," and the entire district was still unbalanced, requiring another in-depth movement to achieve comprehensive and thorough land reform. A general inspection is now underway.

    祁县三区初步完成填补
    六十八户赤贫上升中农
    【本报长治二十六日电】白晋路北段东侧祁县三区，土地改革获初步胜利。该区大部村庄是去年九月才从阎伪重压下解放出来，解放后民主政府首先施行紧急救济，并紧接着将作恶多年的大汉奸的土地分给贫苦农民，因而启发了群众，进行反奸清算，但由于果实分配不甚恰当（谁提意见谁分）及思想发动不够（主要是变天思想克服不够），致这一运动始终局限在少数群众的圈子里。十一月，区领导上检讨后，首先训练了八个村的一百六十个积极分子，并培养了三十七个核心干部。这一批积极层返村后，一面严密监视恶霸地主，一面在群众中进行大串通，并提出简短的动员口号：“诉怨枉，要土地，翻身靠斗争，斗争靠力量，穷找穷家，苦找苦家，麻糖沾芝麻，沾的越多力量越大”。串通动员后，接着即展开了小型的诉苦酝酿，明确斗争对象，迅即进行大会斗争。区上也大胆的给撑腰作主。因此运动开展迅速猛烈，短短一月内，即将百余恶霸地主斗垮，农民收回了大量土地财物。果实分配，是按填平补齐的原则，五个村统计：七百廿四户中，即有五百二十户分得果实，六十八户赤贫，均升为中农，贫农绝大部分也上升了；群众组织均已建立，五个村已有农会会员六百六十五人；民兵九十一人，并涌现出新的积极分子，男女共达一百九十四人。该区新年总结运动，认为仅系初步实现了耕者有其田，全区还不平衡，仍需进行一次深入运动，以求全面彻底的实现土地改革。现已普遍进行检查中。
