Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 11th to the 13th: In recent days, the national student movement protesting the atrocities of the American troops has continued to wage a sustained struggle. In Shanghai, the "Shanghai Student Federation," representing 300,000 students, issued a declaration regarding the atrocities of the American troops, firmly advocating expelling American troops from the country. It also sent a letter to Truman, proposing four demands: (1) Compensate all losses to the insulted students. (2) Severely punish the perpetrators. (3) Apologize to all Chinese people. (4) Order the withdrawal of American troops from China. The "Committee for Protesting American Troops' Atrocities" of the Law School of Jinan University and other schools, as well as students from major high schools in Shanghai, successively issued declarations and protest letters, unanimously demanding the punishment of the perpetrators and the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China. The protest letter from students of Minzhi New College pointed out the conspiracy of "American imperialism to turn China into a colony." Students from the YMCA Middle School said, "We must unite the strength of our own people." All female students of Tongji University issued a declaration stating: "We have not forgotten the hideous faces of Japanese fascists, yet others stand on our land and trample on our compatriots, making us endure the pain of being enslaved. We must not allow these brutes to run rampant on our land again." More than 1,800 students from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou held a "Rally Protesting the Atrocities of American Troops," resolving to strike and march in support of the students in Beiping. They also issued a declaration protesting the KMT government's pro-foreign policy. Professors, both Chinese and foreign, from various places have also expressed sympathy and support. Renowned Shanghai professors Wu Lifu, Hong Shen, Chen Wangdao, Zhang Jinyi, Xiao Gan, and more than thirty others signed a request to the U.S. government to change its policy toward China. Xia Rende, an American professor at Yenching University in North China, said with indignation: "In China, which is already at peace, why retain American weapons and troops? I originally opposed the stationing of American troops in China." Xia stated that he not only wished Yenching University students to participate more in this march but also hoped that faculty members would participate. Wen Xin, the only American professor at Tsinghua University, fully sympathized with the students' protest actions. He said, "If I had known about this beforehand, I would have joined the students' march."

The liberated areas are giving enthusiastic support to the patriotic student movement in the KMT-controlled areas. More than a thousand people from all walks of life in the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning and Rehe provinces held demonstrations on the 7th. The Women's Federation of the Jin-Sui Liberated Area and the Women's Federation of Qiqihar City sent telegrams to women across the country, painfully pointing out: "Ms. Shen's being humiliated is a great shame for Chinese women and the Chinese nation. The KMT government should bear full responsibility for this illegal act."
