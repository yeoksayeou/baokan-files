[This dispatch from our Taiyue Front on the 3rd] Broad Offensive in the Jinan Triangle Area: Taiyue Troops Recapture Yicheng; Qucun, Dajiao, and Twenty Other Important Towns Also Celebrate Liberation. To coordinate with the Lüliang operations, the Jinan Eighth Route Army launched a broad offensive in the Yicheng, Quwo, and Jiangxian triangle area from New Year's Eve to New Year's Day, recovering Yicheng County and more than 20 important strongholds including Taishan Temple and Shijiazhuang in Yicheng, Qucun Town in Quwo, and Dajiao in Jiangxian. The rear of the Jinan Chiang Kai-shek's troops is now under serious threat. A portion of the 200th Regiment of the 67th Brigade of the 30th Division of Chiang's army stationed in Yicheng (of which two battalions have been annihilated by the Lüliang Eighth Route Army) and the entire Yan's special "Love the Homeland Corps" were wiped out. The results of the battle are being verified. At the same time, another unit of the Eighth Route Army broke into the rear of the Chiang army on the Qu(wo)-Yi(cheng) highway and liberated the handicraft industry town of Qucun (30 miles northeast of Quwo) on New Year's Day. According to preliminary statistics, the entire Third Battalion of the Quwo "Love the Homeland Corps," more than 400 men, and one Yan's puppet Fourth District armed district office were annihilated. Chiang's die-hards were panicked by this sudden offensive. A platoon of Chiang's troops stationed at Shijiazhuang surrendered without a fight.

[This dispatch from our Taiyue Front on the 3rd] The people of Yicheng welcomed their liberators, the Eighth Route Army, into the city on New Year's Day with狂欢 [wildly joyous] emotions. Yicheng was liberated by the Eighth Route Army on December 28th of the year before last. After Chiang's troops invaded the city on September 3rd last year, they imposed exorbitant taxes and levies, and the people suffered miserably. The people were overjoyed when the Eighth Route Army recaptured the city this time, as if they had seen the light of day again.

[This dispatch from our Taiyue Front on the 3rd] (Delayed) Yi(cheng) Jiang(xian) militiamen smash Yan's special "Love the Homeland Corps" mopping-up operation. Before Yicheng was recaptured by the Eighth Route Army, more than 1,000 members of Yan's special "Love the Homeland Corps" stationed in the city launched a mopping-up operation in three routes towards the mountainous areas southeast of Yicheng and within Jiangxian County on December 20th, raping, looting, and plundering along the way. After the Yicheng Jiangxian militia rotation teams bravely resisted, all three routes were repelled, killing and wounding more than 90 people including Zhang Chengwu, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the "Love the Homeland Corps." The corps' original plan to carry out a week-long mopping-up operation was completely shattered, and they fled back to Yicheng on the 22nd.

　　广泛出击晋南三角地带
    太岳我军光复翼城
    曲村大交等二十余重镇亦同庆解放
    【本报太岳前线三日急电】晋南八路军配合吕梁作战，于除夕夜至元旦在翼城、曲沃、绛县三角地带广泛出击，收复翼城县城及翼城之太山庙、史家庄、曲沃之曲村镇、绛县之大交等廿余重要据点。现晋南蒋军后方已感受严重威胁。盘据翼城之蒋军三十师六十七旅二○○团一部（其中两个营已为吕梁八路军消灭）及阎特“爱乡团”全部就歼，战果正清查中。同时，八路军另一部突入蒋军后方曲（沃）翼（城）公路上，于元旦日一举解放手工业重镇曲村（曲沃东北三十里）。据初步统计：歼灭曲沃“爱乡团”第三营全部四百余人及阎伪第四区武装区公所一处。蒋顽对此一突发之攻势，惊惶失措，史家庄据点蒋军一排即不战而降。
    【本报太岳前线三日电】翼城人民于元旦以狂欢情绪，欢迎他们的解放者八路军进驻城内。按翼城在前年十二月二十八日为八路军解放，去年九月三日蒋军侵占该城后，横征暴殓，人民痛苦不堪，此次被八路军收复，人民欢欣若狂，有各重见天日。
    【本报太岳三日电】（迟到）翼（城）绛（县）民兵粉碎阎特“爱乡团”扫荡。在翼城被八路军收复之前，盘据该城之阎特“爱乡团”千余人，于十二月二十日分三路向翼城东南及绛县境内山岳地区扫荡，沿途奸淫掳掠，经翼城绛县民兵轮战队奋起阻击，将其三路全部击退，计毙伤“爱乡团”第一营营长张成五以下九十余人。该团原拟扫荡一周之计划全被粉碎，乃于二十二日窜回翼城。
