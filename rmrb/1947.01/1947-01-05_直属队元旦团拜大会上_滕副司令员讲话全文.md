1946 passed in tense battles. Now the reactionaries are attacking Daming, and our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army is struggling. At the same time, a part of our main force is launching a victorious counterattack into the enemy's rear. On New Year's Eve, we recovered the two cities of Liaocheng and Juye. Victory news will continue to come from all sides. This is our New Year's gift to the Chinese people.

In January 1946, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to sign a ceasefire order and stand up to pass the Political Consultative Conference resolution. The Chinese people once won a temporary peace from January 13th to June. One of the important reasons was that our liberated areas carried out four months of resolute self-defense warfare after September 1945, strongly打击ing the reactionaries' offensive. At that time, our region completed the Shangdang and Pinghan major annihilation battles. After the ceasefire order was issued, our area's military and civilians sincerely abided by it, and we strived for peace. However, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries launched a large-scale offensive against our Meng County on January 14th, immediately after signing the ceasefire order. From January 13th to June, the Kuomintang's offensive can be said to have never stopped. According to incomplete statistics, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries launched more than 2,000 offensives against our border area, occupying nearly 20,000 square miles of our liberated area. We were also forced to carry out self-defense, killing and capturing more than 40,000 Chiang soldiers. This shows that even in a peaceful situation, war is still constantly going on. The difference is that we are fighting and talking at the same time. War is not in its true colors, but is still being carried out under the guise of peace. On July 14th, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the support of US imperialism, tore up all solemn resolutions and orders, organized 50 brigades of troops, and launched an unprecedented large-scale offensive against our Ji-Lu-Yu, Northern Henan, and Southern Shanxi regions. This major battle has been going on for half a year. From this year's sharp struggle, we clearly realize that the US imperialist aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek fascist dictators collude with each other. They have no integrity or personality. They only have war and the slaughter of the people. Therefore, we Chinese people have no other way to go but to adopt self-defensive military struggle, which has become the main form of the people's struggle.

In this year's self-defense war, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu military and civilians, under the wise leadership of our Party Central Committee, basically completed the task of self-defense struggle. Throughout the year, we fought a total of 3,950 battles and seven major campaigns, annihilating a total of 18 brigades of Chiang's regular army, totaling 155,000 people, of which nearly 100,000 were captured, including more than ten generals, including division commander Zhao Xitian, brigade commander Huang Zhengcheng, Liu Guangxin, Yang Xianming, etc. In this achievement, not only did our field army fulfill its most glorious and sacred task, but our local corps, guerrillas, and armed work teams also made huge contributions. In this achievement, according to the statistics of only four military regions, there were more than 3,000 battles throughout the year, annihilating more than 52,000 enemies, including more than 20,000 captured enemies, seizing nine mountain cannons, more than 1,200 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 16,000 long and short guns. Among them, the Taiyue Military Region alone annihilated more than 17,000 enemies, seizing 650 light and heavy machine guns and 5,000 long and short guns. In this year's self-defense war, countless heroes emerged in our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army, creating many moving deeds, such as the model battle of the Dayang Lake annihilation battle, the 100 heroes of Zhangfengji, the Long'@ji defense battle, the annihilation battles of Shangguanque and Chen Yan on the Linfu line, the Juancheng annihilation battle, and the Huaxian annihilation battle. These are immortal works that will shine through the ages. Our local troops and militias, such as the Taiyue Jiyuan Du Balian militia, crushed 130 enemy attacks in three months to defend their hometown; the Hongdong blasting hero Shang Qingfu buried landmines 20 times, killing 75 enemies; the Taihang Shouyang Independent Battalion defeated more with less, creating a zero to seventy annihilation record; the Ji-Lu-Yu Kaocheng militia persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines in just the second half of September, capturing more than 100 enemy guns. They used inferior weapons, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and fought with the powerful enemy together with the people,打击ing the homecoming corps and liquidation teams, persisting in the positions behind the enemy or on the edge. These are all worthy of praise.

When the reactionaries launched a blitz offensive against our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area in July, because we had underestimated the US-Chiang reactionaries and overestimated peace, our preparations were temporarily insufficient, but we quickly overcame this weakness. We implemented Chairman Mao's policy of concentrating absolute superior forces,打击ing the enemy's weaknesses, annihilating the enemy's living forces one by one, taking big steps forward and backward, and not focusing on the gains and losses of one city or one place, supplemented by mass guerrilla warfare. Under this guiding principle, we temporarily abandoned more than 40 empty cities, and one-fifth of the region's population temporarily became guerrilla areas. But in half a year, we annihilated 16 brigades, and not a single battalion or company of our army was annihilated. This greatly reduced Chiang Kai-shek's mobile forces. In early September, the mobile troops that Chiang Kai-shek put into battle in one area of the Longhai Railway were 21 brigades, but now the forces fighting in the Ji-Lu-Yu and Luliang regions are only 13 brigades. Because Chiang's army was continuously annihilated by us, Chiang Kai-shek had to concentrate his troops to fight. Many places were extremely empty. Some county towns had no regular army garrison at all. Thus, we began a partial counteroffensive in November and successively recovered Yuanqu, Jiyuan, Yuncheng, Juancheng, Wenxian and other cities, actively mobilizing the enemy. The war situation has gradually begun to change, and our army is gradually changing from passive to active. At the same time, because we insisted on carrying out mass guerrilla warfare, launched a counter-liquidation offensive, persisted in enemy-occupied positions, and cooperated with the main force to fight, after four or five months of efforts by the military and civilians behind enemy lines, the situation in the vast occupied areas behind enemy lines has been opened up. The peasants who turned over armed themselves one after another. Under the leadership of cadres who supported the people to perform meritorious deeds, they suppressed homecoming corps, liquidation teams, and die-hard traitors, bullies, and secret agents everywhere. Now the vast majority of the masses, including most landlords and rich peasants, have united around our Party. Many landlords have expressed remorse and compromise. The strength of our Party and our army behind enemy lines has been growing and consolidating day by day. Only a very few areas have not developed sufficiently. Guerrilla warfare has become one of the important components of our struggle. We believe that in the near future, it will surely exert great power in coordinating with our main force's counteroffensive.

From the above situation, we can see three problems: First, Chiang's army can be and can be annihilated in large quantities. The annihilation of 16 brigades in more than five months is the best illustration. No matter how serious the situation in all occupied areas is at the beginning, the situation can be opened up and the positions can be persisted. In five or six months, we have restored most of the villages in the occupied areas. The examples of Southern Shanxi and Yu-Wan-Su can also illustrate this. Some people have exaggerated the social forces of the reactionaries, which have been shattered by facts. Second, Chiang's army's troops are even more insufficient, the battle lines are even wider, Chiang's army is turning to the passive, and the time for our army to seize the initiative will certainly arrive. Third, our army is becoming stronger and stronger, and its mastery of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and combat methods is becoming more and more proficient, and its technology is becoming more and more improved. These three points once again prove that Chiang's army will be defeated and our army will win.

The victory of our People's Liberation Army is also because we are waging a people's war, a just war, for survival, for defending the integrity of the Political Consultative Conference resolution, and for defending our homeland and the fruits of struggle. Chiang Kai-shek is betraying the nation, implementing dictatorial rule, tearing up the Political Consultative Conference resolution, and launching an unjust civil war. Therefore, in this self-defense war, we have won the support of the broad masses of the people and the support of the liberated Chiang soldiers. Especially on the basis of land reform, nearly 100,000 peasants who turned over in half a year joined the People's Liberation Army, and more than 30,000 liberated Chiang soldiers also joined our People's Liberation Army. The rear supports the front line, and the local supports the army, creating an unprecedented upsurge. The manpower, ammunition, clothing and food supplies needed for army operations have never experienced difficulties. In particular, the medical rescue work on the Ji-Lu-Yu front has achieved a level that exceeds any previous time.

Through such efforts, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area has basically won a preliminary victory.

However, the tasks facing the military and civilians in our region in 1947 are still very arduous. We should make full preparations ideologically. We should realize that the light is approaching, but the road to approach the light is also the most difficult and complex. The US-Chiang reactionaries will inevitably mobilize all the reactionary forces in China to continue to attack us. It attempts to open up the Pinghan Line. We must continue to fight hard, not be arrogant or impetuous, and carry forward the tradition of hard struggle to welcome 1947.

To this end, we must carry out the following work in 1947:

1.  Strengthen combat, welcome new battles, and prepare for a full-scale counteroffensive: We must continue to skillfully use Chairman Mao's strategic guiding principles, take big steps forward and backward, create enemy weaknesses, concentrate absolute superior forces, and annihilate the enemy's living forces in large quantities. In all places where counteroffensives are possible, we must organize counteroffensives. We must also continue to improve the combat capabilities of local corps, strengthen guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and widely launch counter-liquidation offensives. When the counteroffensive period arrives, our local troops and armed forces behind enemy lines must bravely shoulder the major task of cooperating with the main force to fight.

2.  Launch a mass military training movement: Each corps must seize all combat gaps to work hard to train troops, improve the three major technologies, combine training with combat, and combine technology with politics. Launch Wang Keqin's mutual aid movement to rapidly improve the combat effectiveness of the troops and catch up with the needs of combat. In addition, each corps and each military region should step up the training of cadres, especially the organization of short-term cadre training, which is very important.

3.  Universally implement Chairman Mao's mass line into the army's work: Learn to apply Chairman Mao's leadership methods of "from the masses, to the masses," creating typical examples and promoting models, and the work style of in-depth investigation and research, and seeking truth from facts to all aspects of the army's combat training, political work, etc. The Sixth Column began to learn this method, and achieved great transformation and leapfrog progress. Its combat effectiveness rapidly improved. This is a good example. Other corps also have achievements in implementing Chairman Mao's mass line, and we must continue to summarize and improve. If our army can universally transform according to Chairman Mao's method, then the transformation and improvement of our troops will be amazing, and we will definitely win more battles.

4.  Strengthen the construction work of the people's army: We must recognize the long-term nature of the war and the vast consumption of the war. We must plan for the long term, take care of today and also take care of tomorrow, practice strict economy, implement scientific calculations, and mobilize manpower and materials in an organized and planned manner. Strictly abide by the system, implement laws and regulations, tighten up agencies in the rear, and replenish combat units. This is one of the most important construction tasks for us to support a long-term war. In addition, we must also conscientiously pay attention to the construction of the people's armed forces, continue to consolidate and reorganize, strengthen their leadership, improve their combat effectiveness, and closely combine them with the current land reform and the great production movement in the future.

　　直属队元旦团拜大会上
    滕副司令员讲话全文
    一九四六年在紧张的战斗中过去了，现在反动派正在向我们大名进攻，我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军正在斗争中；同时我主力一部正向敌人的后方开始进行胜利的反击，除夕的晚上，我们已收复了聊城、巨野两城，胜利的消息将从各方不断传来，这是我们送给中国人民的新年礼物。
    一九四六年一月蒋介石被迫签订了停战命令和起立通过了政协决议，中国人民曾经在一月十三日到六月赢得了暂时和平，其重要的原因之一是我各解放区在一九四五年九月以后进行了四个月的坚决自卫战争，坚强的打击了反动派的进攻，当时我区曾完成了上党、平汉两大歼灭战。停战命令发布以后，我区军民是诚心诚意遵守的，我们力争和平。但蒋介石反动派在签订停战命令以后一月十四日就向我孟县发动大规模的进攻，从一月十三日到六月，国民党的进攻可以说没有断过，据不完全的统计，蒋介石反动派向我边区进攻两千余次，侵占我解放区面积近两万平方里，我们亦曾被迫进行自卫，毙俘蒋军在四万以上。这说明即在和平的情况下，战争也还是在不断的进行着，所不同的是边谈边打，有打有谈，战争还不是真面目的，还是在和平掩盖下进行的。七月十四日，国民党反动派在美帝国主义支持下，撕毁了一切庄严的决议和命令，组织了五十个旅的兵力，向我冀鲁豫、豫北、晋南三个地区发动了空前大规模的进攻，这个大战又已进行了半年。从这一年尖锐斗争中，我们清楚认识到：美帝国主义侵略者和蒋介石法西斯独裁者勾结起来，他们是没有任何信义和人格的，他们只有战争，只有对人民的屠杀。因此，我们中国人民也没有别的路可以走，只有采取自卫的军事斗争，这已成为人民斗争的主要形式。
    在这一年自卫战争中，我晋冀鲁豫军民在我党中央英明领导之下，基本上完成了自卫斗争的任务，全年我们共进行了三千九百五十次战斗，甘七次大的战役，共歼蒋正规军十八个旅，总数达十五万五千人，其中被我俘掳的将近十万人，将级军官十余人，包括师长赵锡田、旅长黄正成、刘广信、杨显明等。在这一战绩中，不仅我们野战军尽了它最光荣神圣的任务，我们地方兵团、游击队、武工队也有巨大的贡献；在这一战绩中，仅四个军区部队的统计，全年战斗三千余次，歼敌五万二千余人，内俘敌二万余人，缴获山炮九门，轻重机枪一千二百余挺，长短枪一万六千余枝，其中仅太岳一个军区即歼敌一万七千余人，缴获轻重机枪六百五十挺，长短枪五千枝。这一年自卫战争中，我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军涌现了无数英雄豪杰，创造了许多可歌可泣的事迹，如大杨湖歼灭战的模范战斗，张凤集的一百英雄，龙＠集保卫战，临浮线上官雀、陈堰的歼灭战、鄄城歼灭战、滑县歼灭战，这些都是不朽之作，光耀千古的。我们地方部队和民兵如太岳济源杜八联民兵三个月粉碎敌人一百三十次进攻保卫了家乡；洪洞爆炸英雄尚清福埋地雷二十次，炸死敌人七十五人；太行寿阳独立营以少胜多，创零比七十的歼敌纪录；冀鲁豫考城民兵仅九月下半月坚持敌后斗争俘敌人枪百余。他们以劣势武器，克服万般困难和人民一起与强大敌人搏斗，打击还乡团，倒算队，坚持了敌后或边沿的阵地，这些都是值得表扬的。
    当反动派七月开始向我晋冀鲁豫解放区闪击进攻时，由于我们曾对美蒋反动派的估计不足，对和平估计过高，我们的准备工作一时曾经表现不够，但我们很快克服了这一弱点。我们执行了毛主席集中绝对优势兵力，打击敌人弱点，各个歼灭敌人有生力量，大踏步的进退，不在一城一地之得失的运动战方针，并辅之以群众游击战争。在这一指导原则下，我们暂时放弃了四十余座空城，全区五分之一人口的地区暂时沦为游击区；但我们在半年中即歼灭了它十六个旅，我军却没有一个营一个连被歼过，这样使蒋介石的机动兵力大大减少。九月初旬蒋介石在陇海线一个地区投入战斗的机动部队是二十一个旅，现在在冀鲁豫和吕梁两个地区作战的兵力不过十三个旅。由于蒋军连续被我歼灭，蒋介石不得不将军队集中起来作战，许多地方就异常空虚了，有的县城就没有什么正规军守备，这样我们于十一月就开始了局部的反攻，先后收复了垣曲、济源、郓城、鄄城、温县等城，主动的调动敌人，战局已逐渐开始发生变化，我军正由被动向主动转变。同时由于我们坚持开展群众游击战争，开展反倒算攻势，坚持敌后阵地，配合主力军作战，经过四五个月敌后军民的努力，敌后广大沦陷区局面已经打开，翻身的农民纷纷武装起来，在干部带头撑腰为人民立功运动之下，到处镇压还乡队、倒算队，镇压死心踏地的汉奸恶霸和特务。现在广大群众包括多数的地主富农已经团结在我党的周围，许多地主表示悔过妥协，我党我军在敌后的力量已经日益发展巩固，只有极少数地区还开展得不够。游击战争成为我们斗争的重要组成部分之一，我们相信不久将来它在配合我主力军反攻时一定能发挥巨大威力的。
    从以上的情况中我们可以看到三个问题：第一，蒋军是可以而且可以大量被歼灭的，五个多月中被我歼灭十六个旅就是一个最好的说明；所有的沦陷区不管其形势开始如何严重，其局面都是可以打开，其阵地都是可以坚持的，五六个月中，我们已恢复了沦陷区大部乡村，晋南、豫皖苏的例子也可以说明。有些人夸大了反动派的社会力量，这已为事实所粉碎。第二，蒋军兵力更加不足，战线更加辽阔，蒋军转入被动，我军握取主动的时机必将肯定到来了。第三，我军愈战愈强，对毛主席战略思想和战斗方法之掌握更加熟练，技术更加提高。这三点再次证明了蒋军必败，我军必胜。
    我人民解放军的胜利，还因为我们是进行的人民战争，正义的战争，是为生存，为保卫政协决议的完整，为保卫家乡和斗争果实而战。蒋介石则是出卖民族，实行独裁统治，撕毁政协决议，发动非正义的内战。因此，在这一自卫战争中，我们得到广大人民的拥护，得到了被解放的蒋军士兵拥护，特别是在土地改革的基础上，半年中翻身农民参加人民解放军的几达十万人，被解放的蒋军士兵参加我人民解放军的亦有三万以上。后方支援前线，地方支援军队，造成了空前热潮，军队作战所需要的民力，弹药，被服粮秣三者供应，从未感受困难，尤其是冀鲁豫前线的医疗救护工作成就超过了过去任何时候的水准。
    经过了这样的努力，我们晋冀鲁豫解放区已基本上赢得了初步的胜利。
    但摆在一九四七年我区军民面前的任务仍是非常艰巨的，我们应在思想上作充分准备，我们应该认识光明已经接近，但接近光明的这段路也是最艰辛最复杂的，美蒋反动派必将动员中国的一切反动力量来继续向我们进攻，它企图打通平汉线，我们必须继续奋战，不骄不馁，发扬艰苦奋斗的传统来迎接一九四七年。
    为此，我们一九四七年必须进行下列的工作：
    一、加强作战，迎接新的战斗，准备全面反攻：我们要继续熟练的运用毛主席的战略指导方针，大踏步的进退，创造敌人弱点，集中绝对优势兵力，大量歼灭敌人有生力量，在一切可以反攻的地方，要组织反攻。我们还要继续提高地方兵团的战斗能力，要加强敌后游击战争，广泛开展反倒算攻势。在反攻时期到来的时候，我们的地方部队及敌后武装，就要英勇的担当起配合主力军作战的重大任务。
    二、开展群众性练兵运动：各兵团必须抓紧一切战斗空隙努力练兵，提高三大技术，使训练与战斗结合，技术与政治结合。开展王克勤的互助运动，使部队的战斗力迅速的提高，赶上战斗的需要。此外各兵团各军区应加紧干部的培养训练，特别是组织短期的干部轮训，非常重要。
    三、把毛主席的群众路线普遍贯彻到军队工作中去：学会把毛主席的从群众中来到群众中去，创造典型发扬模范的领导方法，和深入调查研究实事求是的工作作风运用到军队的作战训练，政治工作等各方面工作中去，第六纵队开始学会了这方法，得到了极大的改造，获得了飞跃的进步，战斗力迅速提高，这是很好的例子。其它兵团在执行毛主席的群众路线上也是有成绩的，还要继续总结和提高，如果我们军队能普遍按毛主席的方法去改造，那我们部队的改造和提高将是惊人的，我们一定能打更多胜仗。
    四、加强人民军队的建设工作：我们必须认识战争的长期性和战争的浩繁的消耗，我们必须从长期打算，照顾今天还要照顾明天，厉行节约，实行科学的计算，有组织有计划的动员人力和物力。严格遵守制度，实行法令，紧缩机关后方，充实战斗单位，这是我们支持长期战争的最重要的建设工作之一；此外我们还必须切实注意人民武装的建设，继续巩固和整理，加强其领导，提高战斗力，使之密切与当前的土地改革及今后大生产运动结合起来。
