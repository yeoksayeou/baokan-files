[Reported from the Jilu Yu Front, January 27th] The troops under General Liu Bocheng recovered Cao County, a major town in southwestern Shandong, on the evening of the 26th, annihilating the entire puppet security brigade of Sun Xingzhai, who had been entrenched in the city. The results of the battle are still being tallied. During the Anti-Japanese War, Sun collaborated with the Japanese invaders in southwestern Shandong, destroying our anti-Japanese democratic government and brutally murdering anti-Japanese military and political cadres and their families. The local people hated him to the bone. After the Japanese surrender, Chiang Kai-shek immediately appointed Sun as the commander of the Cao County Security Brigade, and Sun became even more ruthless, personally shooting and burying alive thousands of our military and political personnel, and frantically kidnapping and extorting, causing many people to be ruined. Sun's annihilation this time is truly the removal of a great scourge for the people of southwestern Shandong.

[Reported from the Jilu Yu Front, January 27th] Our army liberated Shan County on the afternoon of the 26th. The battle began at 4:00 p.m. and by 10:00 p.m., the 3rd Battalion of the 63rd Regiment of the 21st Brigade of Chiang's 88th Division and the Shan County puppet security regiment entrenched in the city were completely annihilated. The results of the battle are still being tallied. (Note: This city was occupied by Chiang's army on September 2nd of last year).

[Reported from the Jilu Yu Front, January 27th] The troops under General Liu Bocheng recovered Qingfeng County on the 25th. Our army surrounded the city in the snow on the 21st and captured it in one fell swoop on the 25th. The results of the battle are still being tallied. (Note: This city was occupied by Chiang's army on December 8th of last year).

[Reported from the Jilu Yu Front, January 27th] In the battle to recover Cao County, on the evening of the 26th, a unit of our army encountered 300 men of the Chiang's puppet security team Zhang Shengtai's troops in Yangtai, south of Cao County. The enemy fled in panic, and our army pursued them to the Sunfuji area, where most of the enemy were annihilated. In addition to those killed and wounded, more than 100 enemies were captured. On the evening of the 23rd, a unit of our local army attacked the puppet Cao County 10th District team stationed in Chongyuquan (south of Cao County), completely annihilating the enemy, capturing Deputy Brigade Leader Li Xiaozheng and 50 others, and seizing 50 rifles.

[Reported from Changzhi, January 26th] (Delayed) The troops of our Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district captured Wen County in one fell swoop on the night of the 22nd. Details will be reported later. It is noted that this city was recovered by us on December 2nd of last year, but due to the Chiang's puppet army's desperate counterattack, we took the initiative to withdraw from the city on the 3rd.

    我军收复曹县之役
    伪保安旅全部被歼
    单县歼敌一个营及一个保安团

    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】刘伯承将军所部二十六日晚收复鲁西南重镇曹县城，将盘据该城之伪保安旅孙性斋部全部歼灭，战果正清查中。孙逆在抗战期间，即在鲁西南一带勾结日寇，摧残我抗日民主政权，惨杀抗日军政干部及其家属，当地人民恨之入骨。日寇投降后，蒋介石即将孙逆委为曹县保安旅长，孙逆更变本加厉，亲手枪杀活埋我军政人员数千人，并疯狂绑架勒索，许多人民因而倾家荡产。孙逆此次被歼，实为鲁西南人民除一大害。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】二十六日下午我军光复单县城。战斗由下午四时开始，至十时即将盘据该城之蒋军八十八师二十一旅六十三团第三营及单县伪保安团全部歼灭，战果正清查中。（按该城系去年九月二日为蒋军侵占）。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】刘伯承将军所部于二十五日收复清丰城。我军于二十一日冒雪包围该城，二十五日一举将其攻克，战果正清查中。（按该城于去年十二月八日为蒋军所侵占）。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】在收复曹县之役中，我军某部二十六日晚在曹县以南杨台与蒋伪保安队张盛太部三百人遭遇，敌仓皇逃窜，我军追至孙福集地区，将敌大部歼灭，除毙伤外，俘敌百余。又二十三日晚，我地方兵团一部进击驻守重圆圈（曹县南）伪曹县第十区队，将敌全部歼灭，俘大队副李效争以下五十人，缴步枪五十枝。
    【本报长治二十六日电】（迟到）我太行四分区部队，二十二日夜一举攻克温县城，详情待续报。按该城去年十二月二日曾为我收复，后因蒋伪军拚死反扑，我乃于三日主动撤离该城。
