    Ge Mu Village Peasants Celebrate Their Emancipation
    Unanimously Resolve to Designate New Year's Day as Emancipation Day, to Celebrate Every Year Thereafter.
    [Our newspaper's Changzhi dispatch of the 27th] The peasants of Ge Mu Village, Lin County, are celebrating the return of land to the people. The village has a total of 107 households, with over 840 mu of land. In the past, six large landlords occupied over 600 mu, and the vast majority of peasants relied on renting land from the landlords to survive. After a thorough reckoning, each peasant now has more than two mu of land. On New Year's Day, over 190 emancipated peasants from the entire village gathered to celebrate the return of land to the people. Everyone wore new clothes, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly high. At the beginning of the meeting, everyone unanimously said: "Chairman Mao led us to emancipation, we should first pay our respects to Chairman Mao." The men took off their hats, and the women took off their headscarves, and bowed deeply three times to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the stage. Then, political director Hao Zhongfu gave a general report on the painful facts the peasants had recounted, and also read aloud the three "change-the-sky ledgers" of the landlords. Everyone shouted angrily: "We cannot forget the pain of the past, and we must unite more closely in the future!" After the meeting, everyone ate a potluck meal together. During the meal, someone proposed: "This is the emancipation meal. Today, everyone holding a bowl is one family. In the past, everyone suffered together, and today everyone is emancipated. In the future, everyone will become prosperous together. Let's designate today as Emancipation Day and celebrate it every year thereafter!" Everyone present unanimously said: "Agreed!"

    葛木村农民欢庆翻身
    一致决议：定元旦为翻身节，以后年年来庆贺。
    【本报长治二十七日电】林县葛木村农民欢庆土地还家。该村共有一百零七户，土地八百四十余亩，过去六户大地主即占去六百余亩，广大农民全靠租种地主土地过活，经过彻底清算，农民每个人都有了二亩以上土地。元旦日，全村一百九十多个翻身农民，集会庆祝土地还家，人人穿着新衣，情绪空前高涨。大会开头，大家一致说：“毛主席领导咱们翻了身，我们应当先向毛主席行个礼”。男人们都把帽子脱下，女人们也取了头巾，深深的对着台上的毛主席像行了三个鞠躬礼。接着政治主任郝中伏，把农民诉过的痛苦事实作了总的报告，并把地主的三本“变天账”也高声朗读，大家愤恨的喊着：“过去的痛苦忘不了，今后还得大团结！”会毕，大家伙吃了一顿大锅饭，吃饭中有人提出：“这是翻身饭，今天端碗的都是一家人，过去大家同受苦，今天大家都翻了身，将来大家同发财，把今天定成个翻身节，以后年年来庆贺！”在场的人，一致说：“赞成”！
