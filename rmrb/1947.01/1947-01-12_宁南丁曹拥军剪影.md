　　Sketches of the People of Ningnan Dicao Supporting the Army
    Ma Renping
  　Welcoming the Guard Regiment
    The news that the Guard Regiment was coming to Dicao spread throughout the village. The masses who had been liberated cleaned their houses and laid out bedding, so that when the troops arrived, they were immediately settled in comfortably. The next morning, a blackboard newspaper read: "Poor peasants have been liberated, don't forget our Eighth Route Army. The Guard Regiment is truly brave, going to the front to protect us. Men carry water, women wash and sew, we will take good care of them. With the army and the people united as one, we will drive back the Chiang Kai-shek gang of bastards." Another blackboard newspaper listed three guarantees: carry water, sew clothes, and supply provisions. The shops and restaurants held meetings, and as a result of the discussions, all goods sold to the army would be discounted. A small vendor said, "How can we do without the army? It's nothing to sell for a little less when the Eighth Route Army comes; consider it my support for the army."
  　Our Army
    On the evening the army arrived in Dicao, the Women's Federation convened all its members to conduct education on the topic of "Whose army is coming?" A middle-aged woman said, "It's Chairman Mao's army." Immediately, a young woman stood up to argue: "No, Chairman Mao is still doing good things for us. I say Chairman Mao is ours, and the army is also ours."
　  Sewing and Washing Brigade
    The Dicao Village Women's Federation organized four sewing and washing brigades. Each brigade leader led their team, holding high bright flags, singing little tunes to welcome the Guard Regiment, and doing the Yangko dance, going through the streets and alleys to each army residence. As soon as they entered, they would ask: "Comrade, what needs sewing, what needs doing? Bring it over." And they would say: "Comrade, you have worked hard at the front. Now that you are home, rest well." A soldier said gratefully: "It's no different than being in my own home."
　Children
    One evening, I went to the elementary school to play. I saw a girl, no more than eight years old, carrying a large cabbage with great effort. I stopped her and asked, "What are you taking the cabbage for?" She simply replied, "To give to the soldiers to eat." I asked again, "Why not let me eat it?" She said innocently, "Are you Eighth Route?" As soon as I let go of her hand, she ran away laughing. Immediately following her, another boy carried a big rooster, walked up to me, and pushed the chicken into my arms, saying, "Support for you..." Before he finished speaking, he seemed to remember something and took the chicken back, saying, "No, it's not all together yet."
　  Director Li Visits Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers
    Director Li personally visited the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to understand the actual situation after the masses were liberated. Of the 32 families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the whole village, 25 households shared the fruits of victory, with each person receiving an average of two mu of good land and some movable property. In addition, the Farmers' Association supported each family with one shi of grain and two shi and five dou of wheat. The mother of martyr Liu Renchang said to Director Li: "In the past, we couldn't even borrow half a sheng of grain from the landlords, but now the villagers are taking such good care of us." Zhang Qingchao, a family member of a soldier, said happily: "When it was autumn, I was sick, and the villagers harvested the crops and brought them home for me."

　　宁南丁曹拥军剪影
    马任平
  　欢迎警卫团
    警卫团要来丁曹的消息传到了该村，翻身群众便打扫房屋，铺好床褥，军队一到，马上很舒服的安插好了。次日早晨，黑板报上写着：“贫苦农民翻了身，莫忘咱们八路军，警卫团真勇敢，开到前方保卫咱。男担水、女洗缝，咱们好好来照应、军民一心多带劲，打退老蒋狗杂种”。另一块黑板报上写着三大保证：担水、缝衣，供给。商号、饭铺开会讨论的结果，各种物品卖给军队一律减价。一个小贩说：“没有军队怎么行呢？八路军来了少卖个钱没啥，就算俺拥护军队了”。
  　咱们的军队
    军队到丁曹的那天傍晚，妇女会召集全体会员，以“来的是谁的军队”为题，进行教育，一位中年妇女说：“是毛主席的军队”。当时立即有一位青年妇女站起来辩论：“不对，毛主席还是给咱们办好事的，我说毛主席是咱们的，军队也是咱们的。”
　  缝洗大队
    丁曹村妇会组织了四个缝洗大队，每个大队长率领着队员高举鲜艳的旗子，唱着欢迎警卫团小调，扭着秧歌，穿过大街、胡同，到每个驻军的家去，一进门就问：“同志缝啥，做啥？拿来”。并说：“同志，你们在前方辛苦了，现在来到家了，好好歇息歇息吧。”一个战士感激的说：“在自己的家里边不过这个样呀”。
　孩子们
    一个傍晚，我到初小去玩。见一个不过八岁的女孩，很吃力的抱着一大棵白菜，我拉住他问，你拿白菜干啥？她很简单的回答：“送给兵吃”。我又问“为啥不叫我吃”？她天真的说：“你是八路？”我一松手，她笑哈哈的跑了。紧接着另一个男生提着一只大公鸡，走到我面前，把鸡向我怀里推说：“拥护给你……”话还没完，又好像想起什么把鸡收回说：“不行，还没有齐呢。”
　  李主任访抗属
    李主任亲自访问群众翻身后抗属的实况，全村三十二家抗属，分果实的共二十五户，每人平均除得二亩好地及一些浮财外，农会另外拥护组粮一石，麦子二石五斗。烈士刘任昌的母亲向李主任说：“过去向老财们借一升半碗也借不出来，现在乡亲们对俺们照顾的可好哩”。军属张庆朝很高兴的说：“过秋的时候，我病了，村中就把庄稼给收割到家来”。
