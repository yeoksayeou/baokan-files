　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 8th, the Allied Council for Japan held a meeting on the 8th to discuss the issue of purging "undesirable elements" from all sectors of Japanese society who had supported the war of aggression, as well as local elections. Soviet representative Derevyanko issued a statement condemning the Japanese government's policy of delaying and obstructing the purge work and election matters, and asked U.S. representative Atcheson when the purge of undesirable elements in local administrative and municipal organs would be completed. British representative Ball followed by praising the Soviet representative's "prudent" and well-documented statement, and directly asked the U.S. representative whether he could confirm that local elections would be held at least sixty days after the completion of the purge work around mid-April. In response to the above inquiries, U.S. representative Atcheson stated that he hoped the purge work could be completed by mid-April, and then the election date could be determined. This purge work involves approximately 1.5 million "undesirable elements," and if it can be thoroughly completed, they will be prohibited from participating in local election campaigns.
