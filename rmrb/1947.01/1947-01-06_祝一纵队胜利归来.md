    Congratulating the Victorious Return of the First Column
    Just as the situation in the border region has entered an unprecedentedly tense and significant turning point, with the bright days drawing ever closer, Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding everything, continues to launch another large-scale northern offensive, attempting to open up the entire Pinghan Railway line and having already invaded our Daming and Linzhang; the elite First Column of the border region has victoriously returned. This exciting news not only gives the military and civilians of the entire region tremendous encouragement, but more importantly, greatly strengthens our self-defense forces, which will have a significant impact and role on the victory of the border region's self-defense war and the turning of the tide of the war in the future.
    The First Column was originally the main force of the border region's regular army. In the Pinghan Campaign of the winter before last, it exerted its great power and achieved the most brilliant victories. After leaving the border region for a year, through arduous long-distance marches and multiple battles, they have learned rich combat experience, making them stronger and more powerful. In the Zhangjiakou defense battle, they cooperated with our army in the Jin-Cha-Ji region on the Huailai front, successively achieving the brilliant victory of annihilating three regiments of American-equipped troops led by a general, which is the best proof. In addition, more than 70% of the commanders and fighters of the First Column are liberated peasants from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, who have long resented not being able to personally avenge their fathers and brothers. Therefore, after returning to the border region this time, they will certainly fight bravely to annihilate the enemy in the future self-defense war and will definitely create even greater victories than the Pinghan Campaign.
    It is particularly worth mentioning that in the difficult environment of Rehe, they not only overcame all difficulties and ensured the supply of the troops through production and frugality, but also helped local farmers carry out land reform, enabling hundreds of thousands of poor people to obtain nearly 100,000 mu of land. Their spirit of hard struggle, their concern for the suffering of the masses, their excellent military-civilian relations, and their political style are all worthy of emulation by other troops in the border region.
    Therefore, as we welcome the victorious return of the First Column, in addition to extending our warm congratulations and sincere respect to all the commanders and fighters of the First Column, we also wish them greater victories in the future.

    祝一纵队胜利归来
    正当边区战局进入空前紧张和重大转变关头，光明的日子日益接近，而蒋介石依然不顾一切，继续再次大举北犯，企图打通平汉全线，并已侵陷我大名、临漳的时候；边区劲旅第一纵队胜利的回到边区来了。这一令人兴奋的消息，不仅给予全区军民以莫大的鼓舞，更重要的是大大增强了我们的自卫力量，对于今后边区自卫战争的胜利和战局的转变，将会起到极大的影响与作用。
    第一纵队原系边区正规军主力，在前年冬季的平汉战役中，曾发挥了它的极大的威力，获得了最光辉的战绩；而在离开边区一年后，经过艰苦的长途行军，与多次的战斗，他们更学得了丰富的战斗经验，使他们变得更加坚强而壮大了。在张家口保卫战中，他们在怀来前线配合晋察冀我军，先后获得歼灭美械将军达三团之众的光辉胜利，就是一个最好的明证。加以，一纵队的指战员中，百分之七十以上都是冀鲁豫区翻了身的农民，他们很久之前，即常以不能亲身替自己的父兄复仇为恨。因此，此次返回边区后，在今后的自卫战争中，自当奋勇歼敌，定会创造出比平汉战役更伟大的胜利。
    特别值得提出来的是：他们在热河那样困难的环境中，不仅以生产节约的办法，克服了一切困难，保证了部队的供给；并且，还帮助当地农民进行了土地改革，使十几万贫苦群众得到了将近十万亩的土地。他们的这种艰苦奋斗的精神，和关心群众疾苦、优良的军民关系及政治作风，都是值得边区其他部队来向他们学习的。
    因此，当我们欢迎一纵队胜利归来的时候，我们除了向一纵队的全体指战员们，致以热烈的慰问和亲切的敬意外，并预祝他们将来的更大胜利。
