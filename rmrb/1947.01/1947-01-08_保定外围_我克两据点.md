Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji) 6th: Since the Eighth Route Army's self-defense counterattack along the Ping-Han and Zheng-Tai lines, it has eliminated 400 enemies and captured two of Chiang's fortified strongholds outside Baoding. Liu Hua's puppet troops in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, after suffering heavy losses in their invasion of Mancheng area in western Hebei since the 21st of last month, changed their direction and harassed the liberated areas southeast of Baoding. The Eighth Route Army stationed in the area fought back resolutely, annihilating more than 300 Chiang and puppet troops, and taking advantage of the victory to liberate Huangzhen, more than 20 li southeast of Baoding, and Dongshiqiao, 15 li east of Baoding, from the 24th to the 26th of last month. More than 240 rifles were captured. On the 22nd of last month, about 2,000 men from the 213th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 71st Division, stationed on the Zheng-Tai Line, invaded Nanxiaopo, south of XX City, and were completely defeated after a fierce battle, with more than 130 Yan troops killed or wounded.
