　　Hygiene Rules for Writers

　　One, exercise for at least twenty minutes every day, preferably in the early morning.

　　Two, have a bowel movement at a fixed time every day, and never eat snacks.

　　Three, drink five or six bowls of boiled water every day, preferably with salt in the morning. Drink one bowl between dinner and bedtime, and two or three bowls between meals.

　　Four, perform a cold water rub in the morning, first rubbing the upper body, then the lower body. Never undress completely. Wash your feet with warm water before bed, or take a ten-minute walk in an open space before going to bed.

　　Five, be sure to have fun after dinner.

　　The above applies to the average person; those with illnesses are an exception.

　　文字工作者的卫生法
    一、每天至少应有二十分钟的运动，清早最好。
    二、每天定时大便一次，决不吃零食。
    三、每天喝五、六碗开水，清早一次加盐更好，晚饭后及就寝前之间一次，两顿饭之间二三次。
    四、早起施行冷水磨擦，先擦上身，后擦下身，切不可全身脱光。睡前用溜热水洗脚，或在空场中散步十分钟，再就寝。
    五、晚饭后一定要尽情玩。
    以上就一般常人而言，有病的人例外。
