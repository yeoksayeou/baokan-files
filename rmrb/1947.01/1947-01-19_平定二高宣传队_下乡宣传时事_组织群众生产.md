　　Pingding No. 2 High School Propaganda Team
    Goes to the Countryside to Promote Current Events and Organize Mass Production
    [Our Newspaper, Pingding News] A propaganda team composed of ten teachers and students from the No. 2 High School in this county went to the countryside to promote the idea that Chiang's army is bound to be defeated and our army is bound to win, to strengthen the people's confidence in victory, and to promote work. In nine days, they visited fourteen villages including Songta and Guocun. In each village, teachers and students divided the work. The female students held women's meetings, taught songs, and organized women's textile work (a total of fifty textile groups were organized, with five to seven people in each group). The older male students promoted people's schools and organized winter production (a total of twenty carrying pole groups and livestock groups were organized), and helped the masses store grain and prepare for war. The primary school students promoted village primary schools, organized children, led the election of League leaders, and established a study system (each village had morning, midday, or afternoon literacy groups). Those who could write helped the village write slogans and current affairs wall newspapers and mass blackboards. The teachers held forums with village cadres and the elderly. Working hours were in the afternoon for women and in the evening for young and middle-aged people, based on the principle of not hindering production, using meal times or anytime and anywhere to do inspection and prepare for war, which was welcomed by the masses everywhere.

    [Our Newspaper, Jilu豫, 17th] In the Patriotic Self-Defense War, elementary school students in Hexi County organized propaganda teams to publicize to the masses everywhere. They adopted the form of a peep show, using reeds to tie a rectangular frame, decorated artistically, with a glass lens in the front, filled with small picture cards. "The Beggar Gets Land" was compiled based on the content of land reform; with Chiang Kai-shek's ten articles of national betrayal as the content, each article was drawn into a picture card; another small tune was compiled with the content of Old Chiang releasing water. The 19th was the Mengzhuang fair, the actors wearing dance clothes, painted faces, and carrying the peep show, entered the fair. Every villager who came to the fair followed to watch, emptying the streets in a few seconds. At the beginning, in extremely popular language, it was explained that 400,000 Chiang's troops had been wiped out in five months. The silent masses happily said, "Chiang Kai-shek has American planes and cannons for nothing. Who wants to work for the soldiers he grabs? Good weapons alone are not useful." When each of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous articles appeared on the peep show, the masses excitedly said, "Old Chiang is really bad, America and Japan are the same!"

    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】在爱国自卫战争中，河西县小学生，组织宣传队到处向群众宣传。他们采用了拉洋片的方式，用苇子扎成一个长方形的架子，装饰的很艺术，前面制上玻璃镜头，里面装上小画片，以土地改革的内容，编了“花子得地”；以蒋介石卖国十条为内容，每条画成画片；另以老蒋放水为内容，编成小调。十九日是孟庄集，演员穿舞衣，画着脸，架着洋片，进了集，每个赶集的群众都跟上要看，把个集引得街上几秒没人了。开始时以极通俗的话，说明五个月的工夫消灭蒋军四十万。沈静的群众，高兴起来说：“蒋介石白有美国的飞机大炮。抓的兵谁愿干？光武器好也不顶用”。在洋片上蒋介石卖国的每一条出现时，群众就激奋的说：“老蒋真孬，美国和日本一样了！”
