　　Military Region Political Department Instruction
    Launch a Movement to Support the Government and Cherish the People
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Military Region Political Department recently instructed all column armies to launch a movement to support the government and cherish the people. The original text is as follows:
    (1) Supporting the government and cherishing the people is one of the ten major policies of our party. All our troops must not relax this work for a moment. This year's work of supporting the government and cherishing the people must be done better than in previous years. It must not be neglected because of the tense war situation and heavy tasks.
    (2) This year's work of supporting the people must adapt to the war situation and must not be carried out mechanically in the same way as before. In addition to generally holding army-government-people discussion meetings and get-togethers, the "Fill the Jar Movement," "Do a good deed every day," launching support-the-people competitions, and establishing support-the-people pledges, all troops should combine the support-the-people work with the war based on the specific conditions of the garrison and their current tasks, and truly achieve its regularization to ensure the constant unity between the army, the government, and the people so that the war receives full and consistent support. For example, border troops should combine uninterrupted combat operations with supporting and assisting the people's armed forces to carry out guerrilla warfare, strike at the enemy's persecution and looting of the masses, protect the people's vital interests, and assist the democratic government in carrying out mass work behind enemy lines.
    All troops must take actively helping the masses to thoroughly turn themselves over, making every effort to reduce the people's burden, conscientiously abiding by government laws and decrees, and strictly implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention as the basic and constant content of supporting the people.
    Even in cases where field troops have extremely heavy war tasks and cannot carry out this work in a planned way, they must, based on the inspection of mass discipline, seize every good and bad example to conduct education.
    (3) Although there have been great achievements and creations in supporting the people last year, generally supporting the government is worse than cherishing the people. Some parts are related to leadership ideology, especially the erroneous idea of "cherishing the people but not supporting the government" has not been completely corrected. This year, we must attach equal importance to supporting the government and cherishing the people. Do not generally stipulate that the focus should be on cherishing the people or supporting the government. Only when the actual situation requires more effort in that aspect can that aspect be appropriately emphasized.
    (4) This year's work of supporting the people should fully promote the achievements and experience of previous years, but it cannot be done in the same old way regardless of the current situation of the troops. It must start from the actual problems existing in the troops, focus on solving them step by step, and gradually open up thinking during the movement.
    Self-reflection and self-criticism are good ways of ideological education, but in addition to self-examination, the leadership should also collect more good facts and report and introduce them to the troops to overcome the ideas and speeches that one-sidedly exaggerate the shortcomings of the support-the-people work.
    (5) Past experience has repeatedly proved that wherever the responsible personnel can lead by example, earnestly take responsibility, and have a spirit of self-criticism, the work of supporting the people will definitely be done well. Conversely, wherever the responsible personnel have bad relations with the local area, have many opinions, and have no spirit of self-criticism, the work of supporting the people in that part will definitely not be good. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must first conduct self-reflection and self-criticism to seek clarity and thoroughness in their own thinking.
    At the same time, in resolving the relationship between the army and the government and between the army and the people, many experiences have proved that wherever the attitude and method of only examining oneself and not criticizing others is adopted, the relationship is immediately improved after both sides have undergone self-examination. Conversely, holding an attitude of reasoning, only saying that others are wrong, and not examining oneself, the relationship becomes worse and worse. Therefore, in the movement to support the people and improve the relationship between the army, the government, and the people, we can only follow Chairman Mao's policy that the army should take more responsibility and first examine itself, not criticize others. If there is any disrespect or damage to the masses, an apology must be made.
    (6) The reports on supporting the people last year were very poor. This year, we must vigorously strengthen the reporting work on supporting the people, greatly commend models of supporting the people, exchange experience, and truly create a wave of enthusiasm for supporting the people. The reporting work should focus on promoting advantages, overcoming shortcomings, encouraging progress, and transforming backwardness. This is an important link in supporting the people's work and other work. In addition to reporting to the newspapers of this unit and the newspapers of this region, typical cases should also be selected and reported to the People's Daily in a planned way.
    After the Spring Festival, the joint teams of each military region must summarize the situation of this year's support-the-people work and report to this department.

### 军区政治部指示  开展拥政爱民运动

　　军区政治部指示
    开展拥政爱民运动
    【本报特讯】军区政治部顷指示各纵队开展拥政爱民运动，原文如下：
    （一）拥政爱民是我党十大政策之一，我们一切部队不要片刻放松这一工作。今年的拥政爱民工作必须比往年作得更好，不能因为战争紧张与任务繁重而有所忽视。
    （二）今年的拥爱工作必须适应于战争情况，不能一律照旧机械进行。除一般举行军政军民座谈联欢、“满缸运动”、“每天做一件好事”、发动拥爱竞赛、订立拥爱誓约外，各部队应当根据驻地的具体情况与自己的当前任务，把拥爱工作与战争结合，真正做到经常化，保证军政民之间的经常团结，使战争得到全力一致的支持。例如：边地部队要以不间断的战斗行动，结合与扶植人民武装开展游击战争，打击敌人对于群众的迫害和扰掠，保卫人民的切身利益，协助民主政权开展敌后群众工作。
    一般部队都要把积极帮助群众彻底翻身，竭力减轻人民负担，切实遵守政府法令，严格执行三大纪律八项注意，作为拥爱工作的基本的经常的内容。
    野战部队就在战争任务非常繁重、不能有计划地进行这一工作的情况下，也须根据群众纪律的检查，抓紧每个好与不好的事例进行教育。
    （三）去年拥爱虽然有很大的成绩和创造，一般拥政比爱民差，有些部分是与领导思想有关的，特别是“爱民不拥政”的错误思想未得彻底纠正。今年必须将拥政爱民同样重视，不要一般地规定重点在爱民或拥政，只有实际情况需要那一方面多出些力，才可适当地着重强调那一方面。
    （四）今年的拥爱工作，要充分发扬历年的成绩与经验，但不能不顾目前部队的情况老一套地笼统地作，要从部队中存在的实际问题出发，有重点的有步骤的求得解决，从运动中逐渐打通思想。
    反省检讨是思想教育的好方式，但在检讨自己之外，领导上还要多多搜集一些好的事实，向部队报告介绍，克服那些片面夸大拥优工作缺点的思想和言论。
    （五）以往的经验，一再证明：凡是那一部分的负责人员能以身作则，切实负责，有自我批评精神，拥爱工作一定做得好。反之，凡是那一部分的负责人员与地方关系不好，意见很多，而又无自我批评精神的，那一部分的拥爱工作就一定不好。故各级领导干部首先就要进行自我反省检讨，求得自己思想的明确透彻。
    同时在解决军政、军民的关系问题上，许多经验证明：凡是采取了只检讨自己不批评别人的态度与办法的，结果双方经过自我检讨，关系马上得到改善。反之，抱着讲理的态度，只说别人不对，而不检讨自己的，结果关系愈闹愈坏。故拥爱运动中要解决和改善军政民的关系问题，只有按照毛主席的方针，军队应多负责任，首先检讨自己，不要批评别人。如有不尊重及损害群众的地方，必须进行道歉赔礼。
    （六）去年拥爱报导做得很差，今年要以大力加强拥爱的报导工作，大大表扬拥爱模范，交流经验，真正造成拥爱热潮，报导工作要以发扬优点克服缺点，鼓励进步改造落后，这是拥爱工作及其他工作中的一个重要环节。除向本部队报纸及本地区报纸反映外，还要选择典型，有计划的向人民日报报导。
    春节后各军区联队须将今年拥爱工作开展的情形作一总结，向本部报告。
      晋冀鲁豫军区政治部  一月十三日
