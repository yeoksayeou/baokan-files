Editor:
    I have a problem that I haven't been able to resolve recently. Some time ago, I married a rural woman who, despite having a junior primary school education, can't find suitable work in our organization. I thought of asking her to stay at home, but she said she's willing to study and improve and doesn't want to stay at home. I'm hesitant to bring this up, fearing you might not handle such minor matters of life, as I've seen the "Readers' Advisor" column mostly discussing work and study issues. But this issue remains a personal difficulty for me. So, I'm writing to ask for your help in resolving it. If it's to be published in the newspaper, please don't use my real name, but use the pseudonym "Zhao Sanyin"!
    Reader ×××
Comrade Zhao Sanyin:
    We will comply with your request and not publish your real name, but the question you ask is not a "minor matter," but a more common issue of work and life for cadre family members. The "Readers' Advisor" column not only discusses work and study matters with everyone, but also life matters, even truly minor ones, and is happy to discuss them with everyone and do its best to help.
    Regarding the handling of your family issue, we have the following suggestions for your reference:
    If your organization doesn't have suitable work for her, it's best to let her go home. You should persuade her: the cadre family members of today are not the "madams" of the old society. Some cadre family members were originally rural women, but once they leave, they don't want to go home because it's more comfortable outside, with food and clothing provided by the public and no need to worry about production or be troubled. This is not good. We believe that even if she returns home, engages in production, and understands that our liberated area is a revolutionary family, she can still make progress at home as long as she works hard in production and studies. She must not learn the ways of the "madams" of the old society and the current Chiang-occupied areas. Of course, we are not advocating that women always stay at home, but that they learn practical skills in production and work and do some practical work. If there are conditions for working outside, then there is no need for her to return home. In persuasion, be patient and clear her mind, and don't force it, lest it affect the couple's relationship. If this method doesn't work, we have the following suggestions for you:
    One is, if there is a cadre family school near you, she can enter the school and work-study, so that she can learn the skills of production and work, and at the same time, her political, ideological, and cultural level can be improved day by day.
    Another is, if there are family members in your organization or nearby organizations who are in the same situation as your wife, they can be organized to form a small textile and sewing factory. On the one hand, they can produce for self-sufficiency, and on the other hand, they can learn and seek progress in politics and culture with each other. Some organizations' family members have done this in the past, and they have made rapid progress.
    Alternatively, since your wife has a primary education, she can go to a nearby hospital or health organization to learn to be a nurse, pharmacist, or health worker. Or go to the telecommunications department to learn to translate reports, send and receive reports in telecommunications work. Or go to a nursery to learn to be a nanny (this job is very important in our border area, and some female comrades are unwilling to do this, which is due to insufficient understanding in their thinking).
    Finally, let's say it again, that is, to find a more suitable job in your own organization. Perhaps it will not be qualified at the beginning, but as long as you work hard to learn, you can quickly become familiar with the business. However, a problem must be solved in thinking here, that is, to regard doing small and specific work as glorious revolutionary work. Some people only talk about doing leadership work and being cadres when they talk about work, but they are unwilling to put down their airs and do specific technical work, which is wrong.
    The above opinions are only discussed in principle. You can discuss with your wife, your direct leaders and colleagues. If you think there are still specific difficulties that cannot be solved, please continue to write to us for discussion.

### 干部家属的工作生活问题

　　干部家属的工作生活问题
    为读者作顾问
    请读者作顾问
    大家有问尽管问
    不懂再向大家问编辑同志：
    我近来有个困难无法解决，就是前些天我和一个农村妇女结了婚，她虽然有初小的文化程度，但在我们机关中找不到合适的工作，我想叫她回家住，她说愿意学习进步，不愿待在家里。这问题我提出来很犹豫，怕你们不能管这些生活上的小事，因为我几次看到报上的“读者顾问”，都是谈些工作、学习的问题，但这个问题在我个人总是一个困难。故写这信来问你们，请为解决，如要在报上登，就请不用我的真名，用“赵三银”这个假姓名吧！
    读者×××启赵三银同志：
    我们遵照你的嘱咐不用你的真姓名登报，但你问的问题却不是件“小事”，而是一个较普遍的干部家属的工作、生活问题，“读者顾问”栏不光与大家谈些工作学习的事，生活上的事，那怕真是小事，也乐得和大家商量，尽能力所及，为大家办事。
    对于你这个家属问题的处理，我们有以下几点意见供你参考：
    你们机关没有合适的工作给她作，最好还是让她回家。应当说服她：现在的干部家属不是过去旧社会中的“太太”，有些干部家属本来是农村妇女，但一出来就不愿回家，因为在外比在家自在，吃穿公家供给，生产不用管，又不要受麻烦，这是不好的。我们觉得就是回到家里，从事生产，加之我们解放区就是一个革命的大家庭，她在家中只要努力生产、学习，同样可以进步，切不可学那些旧社会和现在蒋占区的“太太”作风。当然我们不是主张妇女老呆在家里，而是要学会生产、工作的实际本领，作些实际工作。如果有在外工作条件的，并不要她回家去。在说服中要耐心打通她的思想，切不可勉强，以免使夫妇的感情受到影响。假使这个办法不行，我们还有以下几个办法贡献你：
    一个是如果你们附近有干部家属学校的话，可以让她进学校，在校中半工半读，一方面能学会生产和工作的本领，同时可以使她的政治、思想、文化水平日益提高。
    再就是如果你们机关或附近机关有和你爱人处同样情况的家属，可组织起来，成立小型的纺织、缝纫工厂，一方面生产自给，一方面互相在政治、文化方面学习求进步，过去有些机关的家属曾这样作过，进步很快。
    再不然，因你爱人是有初级文化水平的，可让她到附近医院或卫生机关学看护、司药或卫生员。或到电讯部门学电务通讯工作中的译报，收发报员。或到托儿所学当褓姆（这件工作在我们边区很重要，有些女同志不愿作这件事，这是在思想上认识不够所致）。
    最后是话又得说回来，就是在你的本机关中找较适当的工作，或许一开始不称职，但只要努力学习是能很快熟习业务的。不过这里要在思想上解决一个问题，即把做细小具体的工作，当作光荣的革命工作，有些人一谈工作就是作领导工作，当干部，而不肯放下架子，作具体的事务技术性的工作那是不对的。
    以上意见只就原则上谈，你可与你的爱人，你的直接领导人和同事商量着办。如认为还有具体困难无法解决，请继续来信商讨。
