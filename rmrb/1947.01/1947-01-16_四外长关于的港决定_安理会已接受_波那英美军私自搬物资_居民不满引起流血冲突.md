　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Chenggong Lake News: The Security Council continued its meeting on the 10th and passed the decision of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on the Trieste issue. The vote was ten to one, with the Australian representative opposing the Security Council's need to determine the candidate for Governor of the Free Territory of Trieste, and ultimately requiring the consent of the Yugoslav and Italian governments. The Security Council is scheduled to reconvene on the 14th.
　　[This newspaper report] According to a TASS dispatch on the 12th: A bloody conflict occurred in the port of Bona on the Italian-Yugoslav border. The cause was the local residents' dissatisfaction with the Anglo-American military occupation authorities for emptying the port of supplies. Factory equipment, grain, and even doors and windows were dismantled. Three residents were shot dead by the police and several were injured. The people of Yugoslavia were extremely indignant upon hearing the news. Editor's note: The port of Bona is located at the southernmost tip of the Istrian Peninsula and, according to the decision of the Four Foreign Ministers on the Italian peace treaty, will soon be permanently incorporated into Yugoslav territory.

　　四外长关于的港决定
    安理会已接受
    波那英美军私自搬物资
    居民不满引起流血冲突
    【新华社延安十二日电】成功湖讯：安理会于十日继续集会，通过接受四强外长会议关于的里雅斯特问题的决定，投票时十对一，澳洲代表反对安理会必须确定的里雅斯特自由区总督的人选，最后并须取得南斯拉夫与意大利政府的同意。安理会定于十四日重开。
    【本报讯】据塔斯社十二日电：意南边境上之波那港，发生流血冲突事件，起因是当地居民不满英美军占领当局将该港物资搬运一空，工厂设备、粮食，甚至门窗都被拆卸。居民被警察开枪打死三人伤数人。南斯拉夫人民闻讯，愤慨异常。编者按：波那港位于伊斯的里亚半岛之极南端，依照四外长对意和约之决定，不久将永远并入南斯拉夫版图。
