　　“Large Villages Lead Small Villages, Rich Villages Lead Poor Villages”
    Guantao Pays Attention to the Transformation of Small, Poor Villages
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Weixian, 15th] Guantao paid attention to solving the problem of small, poor villages during the land reform review. Leaders raised the slogan "Large villages lead small villages, rich villages lead poor villages" at the conferences of cadres and activists in various districts and villages, to achieve the full realization of "land to the tillers." The district representative of Chenfanzhuang calculated that after overthrowing feudal rule in their village, they could not only implement "land to the tillers" but also give 50 mu of land to Wufanzhuang. Xiyuan Village calculated that after the struggle in their village, all poor peasants in the village could be elevated to middle peasants, and they could also transfer 80 mu of land to Caifanzhuang. This specific calculation opened up the minds of the cadres of large and rich villages. Then the village cadres went back to their villages to deliberate and put forward the slogan "All poor people are one family" and "Everyone has food to eat." A Chenfanzhuang village cadre said at a members' meeting: "Our village's masses climbed out of the mud pit under the leadership of the Communist Party, but there are still people in the mud pit, and we must pull them up as well." Six villages in the Sixth District, including Xiyuan and Shoushan Temple, voluntarily provided 53 mu of land to take care of the impoverished masses in six villages, including Dongzhuzhuang and Xiaozhai. The masses in the small, poor villages reflected: "Chairman Mao's leadership is good, and everyone's heart has also become better. Otherwise, why would we be able to get things from the large villages?"

　　“大村带小村富村带贫村”
    馆陶注意小穷村翻身
    【本报威县十五日电】馆陶进行翻身大检查时注意解决小穷村问题。领导在上各区村干部积极分子大会中提出“大村带小村、富村带贫村”的口号，达到全面实现耕者有其田。陈范庄的小区代表计算本村打垮封建统治后，不但能实行耕者有其田，还能送给吴范庄五十亩地。息园村计算本村斗争后，全村贫农可以上升为中农，还能往蔡范庄调剂八十亩地。这样由具体算账，打通了大村、富村干部思想，再由村干回村酝酿提出，“天下穷人是一家”，“人人有饭吃”的口号。陈范庄村干在会员大会上说：“咱村群众在共产党领导下从泥坑里爬出来，可是泥坑里还有人，咱也得把他拉上来”。六区中息圆、寿山寺等六村，自动拿出五十三亩地照顾了东朱庄、肖砦等六村贫苦群众。小穷村群众反映：“毛主席领导的好，人人心也变好了，要不然咱凭啥能得到大村的东西？”
