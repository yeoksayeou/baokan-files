　　Following the victory at Jinxiang, our army, on January 9th in the suburbs of Yutai City, annihilated the main force of the 62nd Brigade of the 88th Division and the main force of the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division, both under Chiang's General Fang Xianjue, capturing alive over 7,000 enemy soldiers including the 140th Brigade Commander Xie Mengquan. This is another great victory on the Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) battlefield in 1947. It powerfully coordinated with our army's operations in Shandong, directly threatening Xuzhou, one of Chiang Kai-shek's main bases for the civil war. Echoing the victory in southern Shandong, it adds infinite splendor to the beginning of 1947.

　　The Yutai annihilation battle is a new victory following our army's recovery of Liaocheng, Juye, and Jiaxiang on the Jilu豫 battlefield on New Year's Eve last year, eliminating two regiments of Zhang Lanfeng's troops, and the annihilation of the main force of the 63rd Regiment of the New 21st Brigade of the 88th Division at Jinxiang Chengguan. This victory demonstrates continuity, taking place deep in the enemy's rear. Our army's left wing was thus able to advance 200 li (Chinese miles) southward, and our army's blue arrow pointed directly at Xuzhou, like a sharp blade piercing the heart of Chiang's army, forcing Fang Xianjue to lead his troops north to reinforce, thus throwing themselves into the net. It is worth mentioning in particular that the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division had just been transferred from Taiwan. After a long journey, before it could catch its breath, it was dispatched from Xuzhou to Yutai to reinforce, and was destroyed under the iron fists of the People's Liberation Army in just twenty-four hours of fighting.

　　This victory was one in which our army used the fewest troops, resolved the battle the fastest, and suffered the fewest casualties in all previous battles on the Jilu豫 battlefield. This proves that after our army seized the gaps in the war to train troops day and night, and applied the mass line method in the reorganization and training, the combat effectiveness and tactical skills of the troops have been generally improved, and village combat has become more proficient. This is an extremely significant achievement and worthy of widespread promotion.

　　This victory also proves once again the correctness of Chairman Mao's operational guidelines. After August last year, in order to have broad maneuverability and large-scale advances and retreats, to seek out the enemy's weaknesses, and to concentrate superior forces to annihilate the enemy's effective strength one by one, we proactively withdrew from many cities on the Jilu豫 battlefield, including Juye, Jiaxiang, Yuncheng, and Heze, winning the annihilation of twelve of Chiang's brigades. This "checkmate" placed Chiang's army in the most deadly situation, making the basic contradiction of insufficient troop strength and a vast front line even more acute, and exposing its weaknesses. Thus, we began a local counter-offensive. Many cities were restored, the war situation began to change, and we increasingly shifted to the offensive. This law of war development was difficult for many short-sighted people to understand at the time.

　　Now, the gap in the southern line of the Jilu豫 battlefield has been opened. We believe that continuous good news will be constantly transmitted. We wish the heroic officers and soldiers on the Jilu豫 front new victories!

　　祝鱼金之捷
    金乡胜利以后，我军又于一月九日在鱼台城郊，歼灭蒋军方先觉部八十八师六十二旅及七十师一四○旅主力整整一个半旅的兵力，生俘一四○旅旅长谢梦权以下七千余人。这是一九四七年冀鲁豫战场的又一次大捷，它有力地配合了山东我军的作战，直接威胁着蒋介石的主要内战基地之一的徐州，与鲁南大捷东西辉映，替一九四七年的岁首，增添了无限光彩。
    鱼台歼灭战是继去年除夕我军在冀鲁豫战场收复聊城、钜野、嘉祥消灭张岚峰部两个团及在金乡城关消灭八十八师新廿一旅六十三团主力以后的新胜利。这一胜利表现是连续性的，是在敌人的深后方进行的，我军的左翼因而得以向南推进二百华里，我军的蓝箭头直指徐州，像一柄利刃一样插入蒋军的心脏，迫使方先觉不得不率部北援自投网罗。值得特别提出的，是其中第七十师之一四○旅，系新自台湾调来，长途跋涉，喘息未定，即自徐州开赴鱼台增援，仅仅二十四小时的战斗，便毁灭在人民解放军的铁拳下面。
    这次胜利，是冀鲁豫战场历次战役中我军使用兵力最少，解决战斗最速，而伤亡又小的一次。这证明我军抓紧战争间隙星夜练兵，并在整训中运用了群众路线的方法以后，部队战斗力与战术素养已普遍提高，村落战斗已更加熟练，这是一个极其重大的成就，值得普遍发扬的。
    这次胜利也再度证明毛主席作战指导方针的正确。去年八月以后，我们为了宽大机动大踏步的进退，寻敌弱点，集中优势兵力各个歼灭敌人的有生力量，曾经在冀鲁豫战场主动的撤出了许多城市，包括钜野、嘉祥、鄄城、郓城等在内，赢得了蒋军十二个旅的歼灭。这一着“将”了蒋军最致命的一“军”，使其兵力不足，战线辽阔的基本矛盾更加尖锐，弱点毕露。于是我们开始局部反攻了，许多城市重新光复，战局开始变化，我们日益转向主动，这一战争发展的规律，是当时许多目光近视的人所难以理解的。
    现在，冀鲁豫战场南线的缺口已经洞开，我们相信，连续的捷音，将会不断传来，我们预祝冀鲁豫前线英勇的将士们的新胜利！
