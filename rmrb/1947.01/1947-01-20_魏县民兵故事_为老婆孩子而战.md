Wei County Militia Stories
    Fighting for Wife and Children

    Father and Son
    December 1st was the auspicious day for peasant association representative Wu Xinwen to marry a wife for his son. Relatives and neighbors crowded around to see the new bride. Just as they finished worshiping heaven and earth in the wedding ceremony, the sounds of cannons and machine guns roared from Huilong Township. Wu Xinwen said to his relatives and friends, "The stubborn army is here, our militia battalion must go fight!" He quickly grabbed his gun, stuck two "one-eyed dragons" (grenades) in his belt, picked up a rifle, and shouted to his son: "Quick, get your gun and go to the battalion." The father and son urgently ran out of the house, heading straight for the militia assembly point.
    We Fight for Our Wives and Children
    The militiamen firmly defended the walls of Huilong Village. The Kuomintang-puppet army's charge was beaten back, but the artillery fire was still extremely fierce, indicating that the enemy would continue to attack. While aiming, Zhang Shibin conducted combat mobilization: "We are all liberated people, and our wives and children have food to eat. We are fighting for our wives and children. Who are they (referring to the Kuomintang-puppet army) fighting for? They are fighting for the landlords and bureaucrats... Fight them!" The enemy's assault team came up again. They threw grenades, and the enemy fled back in a panic. The Kuomintang-puppet army leader could be heard cursing: "If you don't go forward, I'll kill you, you son of a bitch." Pieces of the village wall were blasted off by the artillery fire, but the militiamen lay on it without moving at all. Everyone said, "We can't retreat unless ordered to, even if we die."
    Meng Shanjiao Wounded and Rescued
    Militiaman Meng Shanjiao is now lying in a hospital bed recovering from his injuries. He was wounded on the walls of Huilong Village. After breaking through the encirclement, his injured leg was bleeding too much, and he couldn't walk for a while. He crawled to a nearby village. Amidst the fierce artillery fire, the enemy didn't see him. He gritted his teeth and crawled forward, running into an old man on the road, who hid him in a haystack. When it got dark and the enemies had all retreated, the old man finally felt relieved. He quickly hitched up a cart and sent Meng Shanjiao to the Zhang River, finding his own people to specially send him to the rear hospital.
    Capture Wu San, the Staring Eyes, Alive
    The fleeing landlord Wu San, the Staring Eyes, from Han Xiaowang Village, returned with the puppet army's "Homecoming Corps" and stirred up trouble in the village. He ordered the village chief to beat the gong and call a meeting, saying, "Return all the things that were confiscated from me." At dusk, he walked back to his own house to eat. At that moment, three militiamen quietly entered the street, talking to their own people and inquiring about Wu San, the Staring Eyes, coming back to settle scores. Then they jumped over the wall into Wu San, the Staring Eyes's yard and raised their guns at Wu San, the Staring Eyes, who was about to pick up his rice bowl. "Come with us!" Wu San, the Staring Eyes, felt as if he had been struck by a thunderbolt out of the blue, never expecting to encounter such an unexpected event under the feet of the Kuomintang-puppet army. His whole body trembled like a sieve, and he had no choice but to follow the three militiamen.

    为老婆孩子而战
    亦＠
    爷儿俩
    十二月一日，是农会代表吴信文给儿子娶媳妇的喜日，亲友街坊都拥来看新媳妇。刚刚拜过花堂，回隆镇的炮声、机枪声响成一片。吴信文对亲友们说：“顽固军来了，我们民兵大队快去打！”他很快的拿出枪来，两枝“独眼龙”插在腰里，提着一支步枪，并喊儿子：“快拿上枪到大队去”。爷儿俩紧急的跑出家门，一直向民兵集合地奔去。
    咱为老婆孩子打仗
    民兵们坚守在回隆寨墙上，蒋伪军的冲锋被打退了，但炮火仍异常猛烈，显然敌人还要继续冲锋的。张士斌一面瞄准，一面作战斗动员：“咱们都是翻身人，老婆孩子有了饭吃，咱是为老婆孩子打仗。他们（指蒋伪军）为谁？他们是为地主官僚打的……干呀！”敌人的冲锋队又上来了，他们摔出手榴弹，敌人又慌乱的跑回了。还听得蒋伪军头子的叫骂：“不上前去，杀你狗日的。”寨墙被炮轰的一片片脱落下去，民兵们却伏在上面丝毫未动，大家说：“没命令死也不能退。”
    孟善交负伤遇救
    民兵孟善交现在正躺在医院的病床上治伤。他是在回隆寨墙上挂彩的，当突出重围后，伤腿因流血过多，一时走不动，便往附近一个村子爬去，炮火激烈中敌人也没有看见他。他咬着牙往前爬，在路上碰见一位老头，把他们掩藏在一个草垛里。天黑了敌人都缩回去了，那位老头的心才松了些，赶快套车把孟善交送到漳河边，找自己人专送到后方医院。
    活捉吴三瞪眼
    韩小旺村逃亡地主吴三瞪眼跟着伪军“还乡团”回来了，在村里闹邪气。他命令村长打锣开会说：“把清算我的东西全给倒回来”。掌灯时分，他走回自己家里吃饭。正在这个当儿，三个民兵悄悄的进了街，找自己人说话，打听得吴三瞪眼回来倒算的事。随即隔墙跳到吴三瞪眼家院里，对准刚要端饭碗的吴三瞪眼举起了枪。“跟着走”！吴三瞪眼像闻到晴天霹雳一样，想不到在蒋伪军脚跟下遭逢竟外，浑身筛糠，只得跟着三个民兵走去了。
