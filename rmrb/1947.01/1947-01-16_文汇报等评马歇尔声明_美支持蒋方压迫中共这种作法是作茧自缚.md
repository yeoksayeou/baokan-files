Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: A report from Nanjing on the 10th states: *Wen Hui Bao* of Shanghai recently commented on Marshall's statement on China, saying that the United States' unilateral support for one side and its use of military force to suppress the CCP demonstrates that the United States' erroneous policy bears a great responsibility for the situation in China. Shanghai's *United Evening News* said: Marshall's prestige in China is declining day by day, and he has lost the confidence of the Chinese people. The United States' actions in China are a self-inflicted wound. The newspaper pointed out that the balance of internal forces in China is changing, "Everyone knows that the civil war is approaching a turning point, with the strategically active gradually becoming passive, and the originally passive gradually becoming active." Shanghai's *Ta Kung Pao* pointed out that Marshall's "mediation" mission in China has failed and stated that Marshall's statement expressing hope that China would form a so-called "government of free elements" under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek is a hope that is "very distant."

　　文汇报等评马歇尔声明
    美支持蒋方压迫中共这种作法是作茧自缚
    【新华社延安十四日电】南京十日讯：沪文汇报顷评论马歇尔对华声明称，美国单独支持一方面，以军事力量压迫中共；美国的错误政策，对中国局势要负很大责任。沪联合晚报说：马歇尔在中国声望日益低落，已失去中国人民信任心，美国在中国之作法系作茧自缚。该报指出中国内部力量对比正在变动，“谁都知道内战已迫近了转捩点，战略上原来主动的一天天变成被动，原来被动的一天天趋向主动”。上海大公报指出马歇尔在中国“调处”任务已经失败，并称马歇尔文告中希望中国在蒋介石领导下组成所谓“自由分子政府”，此一希望“甚为辽远”。
