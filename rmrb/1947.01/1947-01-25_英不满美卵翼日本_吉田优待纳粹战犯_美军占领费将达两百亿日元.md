(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) TASS and Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 18th to the 22nd: The Japanese government is sheltering Nazis, colluding with Chiang Kai-shek, and flattering the United States, causing Britain to be dissatisfied with the US policy of protecting Japan.

According to a Tokyo correspondent for the London News Chronicle: Three million important Nazis are living a life of luxury in Japan, provided by the Yoshida government, with each person receiving 32 pounds of meat, 15 pounds of butter, a bag of flour, 40 pounds of sugar, 160 packs of cigarettes... per month.

The Central News Agency shamelessly reported that repatriated Japanese personnel from twenty prefectures, at a meeting held in Okayama City in western Japan, "thanked" Chiang Kai-shek for his "preferential treatment." Our compatriots in Tokyo were very angry upon hearing this, because they are discriminated against and oppressed everywhere in Japan, and Chiang Kai-shek does not care at all, but he "treats" the repatriated Japanese soldiers so "preferentially" that they are "grateful."

Pravda published an article stating that Japan provides the United States with huge occupation costs. As of last November, it had reached 19 billion yen, and this year's budget has increased by another 5 billion yen.

A. Yarrowvoy, in an article entitled "Britain and Post-War Japan" in the Soviet newspaper Izvestia, pointed out that British and American interests in Japan are inconsistent in any case. British and American views differ on issues such as Japan's foreign trade, industrial output levels, reparations, economic disarmament, etc. The United States accounts for 70 percent of Japan's foreign trade, while Britain's share is negligible. Britain advocates restricting the development of Japan's light industry, especially the textile industry that threatens its markets, while the United States protects Japan's higher development.

　　英不满美卵翼日本
    吉田优待纳粹战犯
    美军占领费将达两百亿日元
    【本报综合报导】据塔斯社新华社十八日至二十二日电讯：日本政府包庇纳粹，勾结蒋介石，奉承美国与英国不满美国对日卵翼政策。
    据伦敦新闻记事报东京访员说：三百万重要纳粹人员，在日本过着吉田政府给予的优裕的生活，每人每月有三十二磅的肉，十五磅牛油，一袋面粉，四十磅糖，一百六十包香烟……。
    中央社无耻的说，二十个县的日本还乡人员，在日本西部的岗山市所举行的会议中，“感谢”蒋介石的“优待”。东京我侨胞听到这件事，很是气愤，因为他们在日本到处受岐视与压迫，蒋介石一点不关心，却对还乡日军“优待”得使他们“感谢”。
    真理报上载，日本供给美国庞大的占领军费，截至去年十一月止，已达一百九十万万日元，而今年预算又增加了五百万万。
    亚罗佛伊以《英国与战后日本》为题，在苏联消息报上著论指出，英国和美国在日本的利益，无论如何是不一致的，在日本对外贸易，工业产额的水平，赔偿，经济上解除武装……等等问题上，英美观点都不相同，美国占了日本对外贸易百分之七十，英国则微不足道，英国主张限制日本轻工业的发展，特别是威胁他的市场的纺织业，美国却卵翼日本较高的发展。
