Significant Progress in Medical Work

Twenty-First Sub-district Health Clinic Launches Movement to Accelerate the Recovery of the Wounded

[This newspaper reports] The work of the Taiyue Military Region Health Department's medical clinics has greatly improved. Seriously wounded soldiers get whatever they want to eat, wound dressing changes and disinfection are meticulous, and nursing care is patient and conscientious. Since the Self-Defense War, all comrades in the directly subordinate medical clinics have been working actively. Currently, the clinics have made significant progress in all aspects, mainly reflected in improvements in living conditions: convalescents are divided into three messes—large mess, small mess, and special mess. Seriously wounded convalescents eat five meals a day, including chicken egg soup, chicken soup, noodle soup, shredded pork noodles, dumplings, etc. They get whatever they want. The small mess is for less severely wounded convalescents, and the food variety is also great, with meat every day. The large mess is for lightly wounded convalescents, and the adjustments aren't bad either, with meat once every five or six days. Now convalescents are very satisfied. In terms of medical work: special attention is paid to disinfection. The surgical operating room is well-constructed and complete, with steam disinfection for five or six hours each time. Simultaneously, five or six days' worth of materials are prepared at once, alternating between new and old each day. Each person has a disinfection tray and equipment for changing dressings, and each used bandage is boiled once. Most nursing staff comrades are very responsible, with a kind, warm, and patient attitude towards the sick and wounded. Comrades Wei Sishan, Nan Lingrui, and Qin Shan are the most exemplary in nursing. Because all comrades in the clinic have clarified the view of serving convalescents, it has guaranteed the early recovery of the sick and wounded, and played a great role in supporting the front lines. The clinic's work is continuing to improve.

[This newspaper Taiyue, 5th dispatched] The Twenty-First Sub-district Health Clinic has proposed accelerating the recovery of the sick and wounded and increasing the combat strength of the front lines. Deliberation and discussion began on November 15th, and overall and individual plans were formulated, putting forward slogans such as "The pain of the sick and wounded is the pain of the staff." "All staff serve the convalescents," and all personnel in the clinic have taken action under this call. On November 25th, some of the staff in the nursing platoon and management platoon got up to work in the middle of the night, and the streets were always kept clean. In the past, patients sometimes called out several times without getting a response, but now they are answered immediately. The nurses' attitude towards the patients is more kind, and those on night shift no longer sleep. The cooks constantly go to the wards to solicit patients' opinions, and the kitchen is cleaner than before. The sick and wounded, seeing that the staff are attentive and very hardworking, proposed raising money to comfort them. Two hundred and twenty-one people donated money, warmly comforting the staff.

    二十一分区卫生所开展加速治愈伤员运动
    【本报讯】太岳军区卫生部医疗所工作大有改进，重伤员想吃啥就做啥，换药消毒严密，看护耐心踏实。从自卫战争以来，直属医疗所全所同志都积极工作。目前该所各方面都有显著进步，主要表现在生活改善方面：休养员共分三个灶——大灶、小灶、特别灶。重休养员，每天吃五顿饭，如鸡子汤、鸡汤、挂面汤、肉丝面、饺子，……要啥有啥。小灶是较轻的休养员的，吃饭花样也很多，每天有肉，大灶是轻休养员的，调剂的也不坏，隔五、六天吃一次肉。现在休养员都很满意。在医疗工作方面：特别注意消毒。外科室手术室建设得都很完备，蒸气消毒每次五、六小时，同时一次就准备五六天的材料，逐日新旧交替，换药时每个人都有消毒盘与器材等，每次换下绷带，都煮沸一次。大部看护员同志，都很负责，对伤病员态度和蔼，热情耐心，看护中以魏思山、南陵瑞、秦山之三同志最为模范。由于该所全体同志明确为休养员服务的观点，保证了伤病员的早愈，对支援前线起了很大的作用，现该所工作正继续提高。
    【本报太岳五日电】二十一分区卫生所，提出加速治愈伤病员，增加前线战斗力量。十一月十五日开始酝酿讨论，订出全体与个人计划，提出“伤病员的痛苦就是工作人员的痛苦。”“工作人员一切为休养员服务”等口号，全所人员均在这一号召下行动起来。二十五日看护排，管理排的人有的半夜就起来工作，街道均经常保持清洁，过去病人有时叫几声不见应声，现在随叫随应。看护员对病人的态度更和善，晚上坐夜班的也没有睡觉的了。炊事员不断到病房征求病人意见，伙房比过去更加清洁。伤病员看到工作人员招呼周到，非常辛苦，提出募捐慰劳，出钱的人数有二百二十一名，热烈慰劳工作人员。
