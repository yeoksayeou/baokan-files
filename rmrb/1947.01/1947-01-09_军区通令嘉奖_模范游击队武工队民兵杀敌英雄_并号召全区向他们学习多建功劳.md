    二、模范民兵队：
    （一）济源县杜八连（即留庄连地毛岭等六村）自愿的结成联防建立以荆棘石雷十里长封锁线，认真空舍清野，家家埋雷，组织全村转移，每次作战都是全村参战，一年来坡头敌三十多次的进攻都被击退，全年作战一百九十次之多，毙伤敌九十，炸死敌九，俘三十，缴步枪五支，手枪一，牛九十二头，羊四百二十只。八月七日四十个民兵夜渡黄河南岸，俘敌公安局长以下十七人，十月二日又渡黄河烧毁敌机两架，成为河防的坚强堡垒。
    （二）霍县洪崖洞：该村民兵在村外布有地雷阵，十月十九日霍县敌五百余人及牲口二百零八头，来犯时，民兵则以冷枪射击迫敌入阵，地雷爆炸，十三个炸死，炸伤敌二十名，创造了枪雷伏击战的范例。
    （三）平遥常则村：该村创造了地雷铺街战术，十月十八日平遥敌百余进入常则村，进村口时被地雷炸伤一人，扫街时被地枪打死一人。敌一举手一动足不论民房草堆，处处爆炸，乃仓惶退走，此次共毙伤敌十六名。
    （四）霍县阴底村：在泥神下面埋地雷，泥神上写骂蒋之标语，下马洼等地遍设地雷，十二月十二日南坛敌五百余人三路来犯，当为泥神上之骂蒋标语所诱，敌一排长推泥神当即为地雷炸死，敌进到战壕休息又踏炸地雷死伤四人，其另一路经段庄下马洼亦被炸死三人，一天中即炸死敌十五名，我仅耗雷十颗。
    三、模范游击队：
    （一）二十分区之猗临大队（赵川游击队）：该队于七月三十日奔袭安邑北向镇摧毁敌区公所警察所各一个，毙伤敌三十余人，缴获步枪十三支，短枪十支，电话机油印机，自行车各一，我无伤亡，九月初蒋清剿汾南孤山区赵川游击队深入敌区之北向镇，伪装阎军抓逃兵，集合该村警察讲话将其全部缴械，俘顽四十余，缴步枪二十支，轻机枪一挺，掷弹筒一，区公所警察亦全被解决。
    （二）河津武工队稷山区干队：五月十日于河津新绛公路截获阎运输队，俘五十余人，缴机枪六十六挺，零件四十五箱，电台一，马三十余十匹，步枪四支，该队无一伤亡。
    （三）稷麓独立连：十月四日反扫荡中于丁庄与闻喜爱乡团三营三百余遭遇，以勇猛动作将敌击溃，毙敌营长原海清以下七人，伤十四人俘九人，缴小炮两门，短枪一支，步枪十三支，我仅轻伤一人，十月十日郭店伏击战斗毁敌汽车一，获步枪一百二十支，俘敌三人，我无伤亡。
    （四）临汾游击队：半月五捷（三次打县底、侯村、王村、梁底镇）俘敌上尉指导员以下三十余人，缴步枪十二支，手枪二支，洋面一千二百斤，粮七百五十斤，十二月三日又于南席击敌，毙敌一，俘十二名，缴步枪八支，该游击队虽系新成立不久却于一个月内完成歼一排的任务。
    （五）霍县游击队：十二月五日于靳壁击退敌抢粮部队二百余人，毙敌七，夺回粮食十石，张村东埋雷炸死敌十一人。
    霍县四区游击队：十二月十八日该队于霍县北十里之退沙伏击敌保六团百余，以迅速果敢动作俘敌十一人。霍县一区游击队：因该境内区无敌人，自动到四区参战，对俘虏政策执行甚好。
  （五）豫皖苏军区（缺）
