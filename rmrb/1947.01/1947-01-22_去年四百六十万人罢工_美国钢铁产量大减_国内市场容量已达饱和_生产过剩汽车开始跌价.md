Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to recent statistics published by the US government, US steel production last year fell from 79 million tons in 1945 to 66 million tons, a decrease of 17%. The production in 1946 only accounted for 72.2% of the total steel production capacity of the United States. The reason for this was that companies refused reasonable demands from workers, leading to multiple major strikes throughout the year. According to official figures, although the number of strikes last year was slightly less than the previous year, the number of people involved increased even more, reaching 4.65 million participants. The strikes totaled 11.3 million workdays, while the previous year saw 3.467 million strikers and a total of 38 million workdays.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to the US Information Service, the price of cars produced by the Ford Motor Company has begun to fall, a major sign of relative overproduction. Since the end of the war, general US economic experts have believed that the demand for durable goods such as cars, radios, and stereos would be greatest in the post-war market, and would be the main basis for post-war economic prosperity. Therefore, various aircraft manufacturing companies and tank factories have switched industries one after another, producing durable goods in large quantities, especially cars. After massive production since last November, the domestic market capacity has reached a saturation point. According to a dispatch from the US Information Service on the 15th: The output of trucks and buses in the United States in 1946 is estimated to be 15.9 million units, while the highest pre-war record was only 8.22 million units.

　　去年四百六十万人罢工
    美国钢铁产量大减
    国内市场容量已达饱和
    生产过剩汽车开始跌价
    【新华社延安十九日电】据美国官方最近发表之统计，去年一年中美国钢产已自一九四五年之七千九百万吨跌至六千六百万吨，即减少百分之十七。一九四六年产量仅占美国钢铁全部生产能力之百分七十二点二。其原因为公司方面拒绝工人之合理要求，全年发生大罢工多起。据官方数字，去年罢工次数虽较前年略少，惟所包括之人数则更见增加，参加者达四百六十五万人，罢工共计一万一千三百万个工作日，而前年罢工者则共三百四十六万七千人，共计三千八百万个工作日。
    【新华社延安十九日电】据美新闻处讯：美国福特汽车公司出产之汽车已开始跌价，此为相对生产过剩的重大征兆。战争结束以来，一般美国经济专家均认为战后市场中汽车与无线电、收音机等耐用品之需求量最大，亦为战后经济繁荣的主要根据。因而各飞机制造公司、坦克工厂等纷纷转业，大批生产耐用物品，尤以汽车为然。经过去年十一月以后的大量生产，国内市场容量已达饱和点。据美新闻处十五日电称：一九四六年全美卡车及公共汽车之产量估计为一千五百九十万单位，战前之最高纪录仅为八百二十二万单位。
