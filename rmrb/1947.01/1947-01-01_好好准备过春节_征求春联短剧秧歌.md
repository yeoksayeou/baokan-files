　　Prepare Well for the Spring Festival
　　Seeking Spring Couplets, Short Plays, and Yangko Dances
　　Editor Comrade:
　　The New Year is approaching, and our office club originally planned to organize some cultural entertainment to make everyone "lively." But when we held the preparatory meeting, everyone said they wanted to stage a few plays, but they were troubled by the lack of fresh scripts. Therefore, we suggest that the newspaper quickly publish some fresh scripts, especially short report plays and Yangko dances. In my opinion, the content of the scripts should focus on reflecting the heroic and exemplary deeds of the military and civilians in our self-defense war, stories of liberation, etc. I wonder if this can be done?
　　A Person from the Military Region Headquarters
　　Judging from the above letter, the need for fresh scripts is not limited to the Military Region Headquarters alone, but is a universal requirement. "The past cannot be recalled, but the future can still be pursued." Fortunately, there are still twenty days or so until the Spring Festival. We hope to send everyone some Spring Festival gifts—fresh short plays, Yangko dances, Spring Couplets, etc.—to make up for past deficiencies and allow everyone to have a lively Spring Festival. However, our limited number of people have limited abilities, so we can only hope that all reader comrades will take action. You write a script, he composes a Yangko dance, you write a Spring Couplet, he puts together a drum verse. Fortunately, our real struggle life is very rich. Everyone who can talk should talk, and everyone who can write should write, and quickly send them to us, so that we can publish them as soon as possible for use in various places.

### 好好准备过春节  征求春联短剧秧歌

专栏：

　　好好准备过春节
    征求春联短剧秧歌
    编者同志：
    新年到了，我们机关俱乐部里，本来打算搞些文化娱乐，大家“红火”一番。但在开筹备会的时候，都说要排演几个剧看，可是苦于没有新鲜剧本，所以我们建议报纸，快登载些新鲜剧本，短的报告剧和秧歌更好。剧本内容，我看以反映我们自卫战争中军民英勇模范事例，翻身故事等为最合适，不知能不能作到？
    军区司令部一人
    从上面这一来信看，供给大家新鲜剧本，不只是军区司令部一处需要，而是一个普遍的要求。“往者不可谏，来者尤可追”，好在现在到春节，还有二十来天，我们希望能为大家送些春节的礼物——新鲜短剧、秧歌、春联等以补过去的缺陷，让大家来过个热热闹闹的春节。但我们少数几个人能力有限，只能希望一切读者同志，大家动手，你来写个剧本，他来编个秧歌，你来编付春联，他来凑段鼓词，好在我们的现实斗争生活，非常丰富，大家动嘴的动嘴，动笔的动笔，赶快写寄给我们，以便早日采登，供各地选用。
     ——编者
