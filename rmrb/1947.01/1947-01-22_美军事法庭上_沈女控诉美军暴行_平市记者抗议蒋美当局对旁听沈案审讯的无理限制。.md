　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. According to a Central News Agency report from Peiping on the 19th: Miss Shen Chong, who was violated by U.S. soldiers, accompanied by her father Shen Shao, attended the U.S. military court on the 18th to describe the shameless and beastly acts of the U.S. military against her (Note: this trial began on the 17th). She first stated: Until December 24th, she had been in Peiping for 24 days, staying at her brother-in-law's house, and had never been married before. Her tuition fees in Peiping were provided by her father. Before coming to Peiping, her father gave her 500,000, and after arriving in Peiping, her father gave her 500,000 once and 1,000,000 once, all of which were deposited in the bank. She cannot speak English, but understands a little. She then narrated the terrible situation of being raped that day: On the evening of December 24th last year, she went to see a movie, going east from the south entrance of Wangfujing. On the roadside across from the Ping'an Cinema, two U.S. soldiers suddenly grabbed her, one holding her left hand and putting his arm around her waist, and the other pulling her right hand and hugging her. When she shouted "Help!", the U.S. soldiers immediately covered her mouth with their hands. The two U.S. soldiers first dragged her to the south side of South Dadi (Southern Great Earth) and raped her once. At that time, she noticed a flashlight shining once. After the rape, the U.S. soldiers pulled her eastward, still at the foot of the south wall, and again noticed a flashlight shining. They attempted to rape her again, but because of the flashlight searching, this rape was not successful. Then they dragged her to an empty room in East Dadi. She wanted to escape, but was grabbed by the U.S. soldiers and slipped into a ditch, but was not injured. Afterwards, she was dragged by the U.S. soldiers to an empty room on Hade Men Street. It was dark at that time and she couldn't see, and she was raped again by the U.S. soldiers. At this point in her testimony, Shen recalled that she found her pants, which had been taken off at the foot of the south wall. Because they were white, she picked them up and waved them, shouting for help, but the U.S. soldiers covered her mouth with their hands. When the U.S. soldiers were raping her at the foot of the south wall, another U.S. soldier helped. She thinks that the scars on her legs were caused by the U.S. soldiers at that time. The U.S. soldier then left. She struggled and shouted again, but her legs were exhausted. She was dragged by the U.S. soldiers to the empty room in East Dadi. At this time, she had disregarded her life and death, and her throat was blocked, so she could no longer shout... The inspector then asked about her situation before coming to Peiping. She stated that she was 19 years old, and was in Shanghai from 1937 to 1946, during the Japanese occupation period. She never socialized with foreign soldiers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. Peiping News: More than 40 reporters from various newspapers in Peiping and major newspapers in other cities, representing 28 units, recently jointly sent letters to the Peiping Reporters Association and the Foreign Affairs Office of the Municipal Government, protesting the unreasonable restrictions imposed by the Chiang-U.S. authorities on reporters attending the Shen case trial. The letter to the Reporters Association stated: "The U.S. military atrocity is a major case of concern both at home and abroad. The jury cannot be arbitrarily appointed by your council. The method of unified release of information about the military court by the jury is even more inconsistent with the principle of freedom of the press and is difficult to comply with. Furthermore, we unanimously oppose the decision of your association to disqualify members who do not comply with the decision to publish news!" The letter to the Foreign Affairs Office stated: "The number of Chinese reporters in Peiping is about ten times that of foreign reporters. The principle of 'nine for nine' (meaning that the U.S. side stipulated that nine Chinese and foreign reporters each be allowed to attend the Shen case) is a very unreasonable measure, and the organization of the jury violates the principle of freedom of the press."

    平市记者抗议蒋美当局对旁听沈案审讯的无理限制。
    【新华社延安十九日电】据中央社北平十九日电：被美军污辱之沈崇小姐由其父沈劭陪同出席十八日美军事法庭，申述美军对伊之无耻兽行经过（按此一审判系于十七日开始）。她首称：至十二月二十四日为止，她来平方二十四天，住姐夫家，以前未曾结婚；在平入学费用系由父供给，来平前父亲给五十万，抵平后父亲又先后给她一次五十万、一次一百万元，均存放银行中。不能说英语，但懂一点，继叙当日被强奸之可怕情形：去年十二月二十四日晚去看电影，由王府井南口向东，在平安影院对面路边街旁，突有两美兵将她架走，一握左手，并手揽伊腰，另一则拉右手搂她。在她叫喊“救命”时，美兵即以手掩她的口。两美兵先架至南大地南墙边强奸一次；是时发现手电光一次。强奸后，美兵拉她向东，仍在南墙根下又发现手电光，此次又拟强奸，因有手电光搜寻，故此次强奸未遂；继拉彼至东大地空房，伊欲脱身逃出，却被美兵抓住，同时滑入一沟中，但未跌伤；其后又被美兵拖至哈德门大街一空房，该时黑暗看不见，当又被美兵强奸一次。沈供至此，又回述在南墙根时发现她被脱下之裤子，因系白色，乃拾起摇动求救喊叫时，被美兵用手将口掩塞；当美兵在此处南墙根强奸时，另一美兵曾帮忙。腿上伤痕，想系当时为美兵所损害。该美兵旋即他去，彼时曾又经挣扎喊叫，腿至气力全无，复又被美兵拉至东大地空房，实已置生死于度外，此时嗓子被塞不能再喊…………。检查官又询来平前情形，她供称年十九，民二十六年至三十五年在沪，系在日本占领时期；从未与外国兵社交。
    【新华社延安二十日电】北平讯：平市各报及外埠各大报记者四十余人，代表二十八单位，顷联名致函平记者公会及市府外事处，抗议蒋美当局对记者旁听沈案审讯之无理限制。在致记者公会函内称：“美军暴行事件系中外瞩目之重大案件，观审团不能由贵理事会随意推定；关于军事法庭消息。由观审团统一发布之办法更与新闻自由原则不符，碍难遵照。另贵会决议对不遵照决议发布新闻之记者予以取消会员资格之处分，我们一致表示反对！”在致外事处函中称：“在平中国记者人数为外记者十倍左右，九九对等之办法（按即美方规定准中外记者各九人旁听沈案）实为一极不合理之措施，而观审团之组织并违新闻自由原则。
