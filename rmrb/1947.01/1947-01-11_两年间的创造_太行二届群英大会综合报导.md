　　Creation in Two Years
    ——Comprehensive Report on the Second Taihang Heroes' Congress

    This newspaper's reporter compiled a report on the Second Taihang Heroes' Congress, stating: This is a vivid summary of the various works in the Taihang area in the two years since the first Heroes' Congress in the winter of 1944. In the past two years, the new hero movement in the Taihang area has greatly developed in the causes of emancipation, production, and killing the enemy. This time, a total of 430 agricultural, industrial, and sideline labor heroes and technical experts, emancipation heroes and militia heroes who killed the enemy, and model village-level workers attended the meeting, of which only 68 were old heroes from 1944 (most of the old heroes have become cadres), and the rest were new heroes who emerged in the 43 counties and cities in the region in the past two years. After two years of the great production movement, the labor force organized in agriculture and sideline occupations in the region has accounted for 78% of the total labor force. According to the statistics of 24 counties in 1944, the average number of organized labor force in each county was only more than 9,000 people. According to the statistics of 20 counties this year, the average number in each county has reached 42,000 people, and 57% of the women, the elderly, the weak and auxiliary labor force have been organized. In 1944, 57% of the agricultural mutual aid organizations were only in form, and this year, the organizations that were only in form have been reduced to 14%. At that time, there were only heroes who led a mutual aid group or a mutual aid team, but among the 117 labor heroes this year, 67 organized and led the production of the whole village. After the winter production was launched in 1945, the entire region saw great development in textile, transportation, animal husbandry, workshops, and all rural sideline industries, and closely integrated with agriculture. Therefore, although the Taihang area suffered wind and frost disasters this autumn, many areas still achieved "cultivating three and surplus one." All the labor heroes who attended the meeting have achieved "cultivating three and surplus one," and the highest has reached "cultivating one and surplus three." The improvement of agricultural cultivation technology is also extremely rapid. This year, 600 villages in Ping Shun, Li Cheng and other eight counties have established technical research and guidance organizations. At the previous congress, when the excellent varieties "Golden Queen Corn" and "169 Wheat" were exhibited, only the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry and individual farmers tried to plant them. Now they have been widely planted in the Taihang area. At that time, cotton was still a rare product in the Taihang Mountains, but now, except for some areas in Xiyang and Heshun that are too cold, cotton has been widely planted throughout the region. This year's output reached more than 30 million catties, which is more than enough to be self-sufficient. The seven first-class agricultural mutual aid heroes elected at the meeting can organize all full, semi, and auxiliary labor to carry out comprehensive agricultural and sideline production, and can solve the difficulties of service, participation in war, and substitute farming by organizing mutual aid labor, and actively improve technology. Shi Cunjin's experience in the mutual equivalence transformation of agricultural and sideline industries, full and semi labor, and fertilization to improve the soil, and Zhang Laotai's precise calculation and meticulous organization work to ensure the completion of the production plan have become the most prominent heroic achievements of this congress. The conference materials also show that the cooperative movement and textile industry in Taihang have made amazing progress in the past two years. The number of rural cooperatives has developed from more than 1,000 in 1944 to more than 4,000 now. The number of members and funds has exceeded four times that before the previous congress. Most of them are mixed business societies that focus on supporting agricultural production and organizing mass sideline production. The 27 cooperative heroes who attended the meeting alone led 194 handicraft small factories and workshops. According to statistics from Ping Shun and other eight counties, the number of rural textile women has developed to more than 116,000, and 72% of them have been organized. In many villages in Wu'an, Ping Shun, and other places, cooperative small textile factories have been established, and the production of homespun cloth has been able to be self-sufficient. Seventy-nine emancipation heroes participated in the congress. They are outstanding mass leaders who emerged in the vigorous counter-traitor liquidation and the implementation of the "land to the tiller" movement in the new district in recent years. A total of 91 militia heroes who killed the enemy participated in the congress. They have made outstanding achievements in launching guerrilla warfare and cooperating with the main force in the war of self-defense against the great counter-offensive against Japan in 1945 and the defense of the fruits of victory. The congress also selected Guo Xing, Li Yuhua, Yang Juhe and other three model militia armed work teams who persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek army to defend the interests of the people. In addition to the above-mentioned heroes and models, there are also worker heroes, merchant models, anti-traitor heroes, support-the-army models, and model military dependents. After summarizing the new experiences of various works, establishing new standards and banners for the further development of various works, the conference concluded: The first congress laid the foundation for the counter-offensive against Japan, and great victories have been achieved in the past two years. This congress has also laid a solid foundation for the thorough realization of "land to the tiller" this winter, for a greater production movement next year, and for the preparation of self-defense counter-offensive forces. During the congress, two exhibition halls of emancipation, production, current affairs, and militia were held, exhibiting the achievements of all heroes and the five million people of Taihang in the past two years. More than 200,000 people visited the exhibition before and after. After the congress, Northern University of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu hired labor heroes Shi Cunjin, Li Shunda, emancipation hero Liang Madou, and textile heroine Zhao Chunhua to go to the school to give lectures in turn for one day.
