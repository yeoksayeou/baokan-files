(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: The struggle for national independence in Vietnam and Indonesia is still on a tortuous path. In Vietnam: Due to the formation of a cabinet by the French Socialist Party alone and the ambitions of some French imperialists, a new war is brewing. The French government is steadily sending troop reinforcements. Despite the fervent appeals from Parisian newspapers for negotiations with Vietnam, French Minister of Overseas Territories, Moutet, although flying from Saigon to Hanoi on the 5th, refused to attend the peace talks invited by Vietnamese President Ho Chi Minh. The current war situation is superficially deadlocked, but small conflicts continue. The main war zones are the Lang Son-Hanoi-Haiphong line and the outskirts of Saigon. In terms of troop strength, Vietnam has 300,000 regular troops and over 1.5 million militia, while the French army has only over 50,000 troops.

In Indonesia: Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesia on October 14th last year, the Dutch government has used the ceasefire period to actively prepare for a new offensive. On October 20th, 6,000 Dutch troops landed in Batavia. At the end of November, fierce fighting broke out again on the islands of Indonesia. Although the Dutch troops were soon repelled by the Indonesian People's Army, as Indonesian Army Commander-in-Chief Sudirman warned the Indonesian people in a broadcast at the end of last year: "The serious situation is still deteriorating," "Dutch Commander-in-Chief Spoor is plotting to launch another offensive." Moreover, war has already broken out in Bandung, Surabaya, Semarang, Medan and other places around the New Year.

Indonesia not only has the strength to repel the Dutch army again, but also, on New Year's Day, President Sukarno ordered the reorganization of the "National Committee" (equivalent to the National Assembly), increasing the number of seats for the Communist Party from one to thirty-five, the Socialist Party from twenty-four to thirty-five, and the Labor Party from four to thirty-five, greatly strengthening the power of the left-wing group and further unifying the country to crush any Dutch invasion.

    法反动分子源源运兵
    越南酝酿新战
    印尼加强团结，积极准备粉碎荷军再度进攻。
    【本报综合报导】据新华社讯：越南和印尼的争取民族独立，尚在走着迂回的途程。越南方面：由于法国社会党一党组阁以及一些法国帝国主义分子的野心，新的战争正在酝酿之中，法政府正源源运兵增援。尽管巴黎各报极力呼吁与越南进行谈判，但五日法海外部长摩泰特虽由西贡飞至河内，却拒绝出席越主席胡志明的邀请和平商谈。目前的战局表面上是胶着，但仍不断有小的冲突，主要战争地区为谅山——河内——海防一线及西贡近郊，双方兵力对比，越南有正规军三十万，民兵一百五十余万，法军仅有五万余名。
    印尼方面：自从去年十月十四日荷印签订停战协定以后，荷兰政府就利用休战期间，积极准备新的进攻，十月二十日就有荷军六千，在巴达维亚登陆，十一月底，激烈的战事又在印尼各岛进行，虽然不久荷军即被印尼人民军队击退，可是诚如印尼陆军总司令苏尔曼于去年底广播警惕印尼人民所说的：“严重的局势，仍日趋恶化”，“荷军总司令斯波尔正阴谋再度发动进攻”。而且新年前后万隆、泗水、三宝垅、棉兰等地已发生战争。
    印尼不但有力量足以再打退荷军，而且在新年元旦的时候，苏加诺总统下令改组“民族委员会”（相当于国民议会），共产党由一席增至三十五席，社会党由二十四席增至三十五席，劳工党由四席增至三十五席，使左翼集团力量大为增强，国内更加团结一致，以粉碎荷军的任何进犯。
