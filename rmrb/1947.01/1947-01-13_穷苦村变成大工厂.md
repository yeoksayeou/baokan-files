　　Poor Village Transformed into a Large Factory
　　Ji Nan Branch
　　Yanghuangwa is a poor village with 160 households in the fourth district of Zaoqiang. The felt hat industry in this village was very developed before the "July 7th" Incident. At that time, there were more than 20 hat body workshops in the village, all owned by wealthy landlords. Poor people had the skills, but life was very hard. After the enemy occupied Encha, they burned down more than 30 households in Yanghuangwa, and the hat body workshops also closed down, leaving only four, with very small output, selling only to nearby counties. After the enemy surrendered, the government provided loans of 1.5 million yuan to support the development of handicrafts, and some private individuals also pooled shares. Within a year, the number of workshops increased to 35, with more than 100 workers. Last year alone, they produced a total of 60,000 hat bodies. The villagers in this village have been liberated from poverty in the past two years. Hu Dianjin's family of four had no house, no land, and often lived with relatives. In March of last year, when the workshops in Yanghuangwa started work, he wanted to do something too, so he carried a pot on one shoulder and his two children on the other, and returned to the village. At this time, it coincided with the government's second loan, he borrowed 10,000 yuan and started working. He and his wife worked day and night, working hard to make hat bodies. In less than a year, the money they earned allowed them to buy 10.7 mu of land and a small house. Last year, the whole family wore new padded clothes inside and out. Now they still have 90 jin of old wool, ready to expand the workshop this year. Huang Buwu was a poor peasant two years ago, but this year he made 2,000 hats and bought 18 mu of land, and has been promoted to a middle peasant. He said: "If it weren't for the government's loan to let us open workshops, my whole family would have starved to death long ago. I know that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are my saviors, and I will never forget them even when I die." Wang Dian, who is 72 years old, earned 120,000 yuan last year, which is more than he earned in his six or seventy years of work. He donated 2,000 yuan when enlisting in the army. This desolate village has become a well-fed large factory, and the men and women in the village are working happily, and the entire village is full of new vitality.

　　穷苦村变成大工厂
    冀南分社
    杨黄洼是枣强四区的一个一百六十户的穷村。这村的毡帽工业，在“七七”事变前是很发达的。那时全村有帽头作坊二十多家，都是有钱的地主们开的，穷人要手艺，生活很苦。自敌占恩察后，把杨黄洼烧了三十多户，帽头作坊也随着倒闭下去，只剩下四家，产量很小，只销售到附近各县。敌人投降后，政府贷款一百五十万元，扶植发展手工业，并有些私人集股，一年内作坊发展到三十五家，工人一百多人，只去年计算，共出帽头六万顶。该村村民在这两年中，都从穷困中解放了出来。扈殿金全家四口，房无一间，地无一垅，常住亲戚家。去年三月里。杨黄洼的作坊都开了工，他心里也想干一份，就一头担着锅，一头担着他的两个孩子，回到村里。这时正赶上政府第二次贷款，他贷了一万块钱，就干起来了。他夫妇俩不分昼夜，泥一把汗一把的积极作帽头，不到一年，赚的钱就要了十亩零七分地和一处小宅子。去年全家都穿上了里表新的棉衣。现还有九十斤老毛，准备今年把作坊扩大一下。黄卜五前年是个贫农，今年作了二千顶帽子，要了十八亩地，已升到中农。他说：“要不是政府贷款叫俺开作坊，我一家子早就饿死了。我算知道共产党毛主席是俺的救命恩人了，到死也不能忘了他。”王殿三是个七十二岁的工人，他去年共挣洋十二万元，比他六七十年挣的工资还多。他在参军募捐时，拿了两千元。这个荒凉的村子，已经变成丰衣足食的大工厂，村中男女在愉快的工作着，整个村庄充满了新生气象。
