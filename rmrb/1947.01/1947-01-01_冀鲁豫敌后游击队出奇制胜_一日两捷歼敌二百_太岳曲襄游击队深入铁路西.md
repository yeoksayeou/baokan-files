JiluYu Frontline Correspondents Group, 30th: Our guerrilla corps in the rear of the Chiang-occupied area has achieved successive victories in recent days. On the 21st, a certain guerrilla corps of ours attacked Dawangji Village, located on the Dingtao-Caoxian Highway. Our troops moved quickly and caught the enemy by surprise. The armed forces of the Fourth District of the puppet Caoxian County, numbering about 200, responded hastily. Under the brave and swift attack of our guerrilla soldiers, the battle ended within an hour. In this battle, more than 30 enemies were killed, more than 120 were captured, and 158 rifles, 4 short guns, 4 small cannons, 4 horses, and countless other spoils of war were seized. On the same day, the Second Company of the puppet Third and Eighth District Brigade of Puyang County, totaling more than 30 men, harassed Liangmen and Dongsha, and were ambushed and surrounded by a certain guerrilla corps of ours, active between Puyang and Hua County. After more than ten minutes of fierce fighting, the entire enemy force was wiped out, capturing 25 men, including the company commander Li Junyan, and seizing more than 20 rifles. We only suffered two minor injuries.

Taiyue, 30th: The guerrilla forces active on both sides of the Quxiao Railway in the rear of Chiang's army have been constantly launching attacks in recent days to cooperate with the Lvliang campaign. In the three days from the 15th to the 17th, they captured 20 Chiang soldiers alive. On the morning of the 15th, the Xiangling guerrilla force dispatched a small armed unit deep into the west side of the railway and attacked Yancun, capturing two staff members of Chiang's army station. On the 16th, another one was captured in Jia Village. On the morning of the 17th, twelve members of the Zhaoqu Jiang-controlled village office went to Nanliang to conscript soldiers and collect grain. The Xiangling guerrilla force rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. All twelve were captured except for three who escaped, and five rifles, one pistol, and more than 300 rounds of ammunition were seized. On the same day, at dawn, the Quwo guerrilla force ambushed the Yan army outside Shayu Village, killing or wounding six of its squad leaders and below, and seizing three rifles and more than 900 rounds of ammunition.
