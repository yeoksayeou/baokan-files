Great French Painter
Picasso's Views on Art
Profiles of World Artists
Translated by Hu Pinqing

This genius, this most famous modern painter, was not at all as I had imagined. His dark skin, white hair, deep wrinkles, and calm demeanor all fully expressed gentleness.

He has a large studio in the heart of Paris. The room is very high, with black beams and a white ceiling. He has a slender dog named Kasbek, which Picasso told us is the highest peak in the Caucasus Mountains. There are many paintings on his walls and easels, all revealing a melancholy atmosphere, the main colors being gray, black, and deep blue. One is a mandolin-shaped girl leaning on a sofa; another looks like a curved chimney. Some depict chaos amidst earthquakes, yet carrying a mysterious harmony—this is the Picasso we have long admired. War, aggression, and terror have made him even younger and more powerful.

"Is a story about you true? One day, a German special agent, holding a reprinted 'Guernica' (a Spanish city that had been tragically bombed by Germany), asked you: 'Is this your work?' You replied: 'No, it's yours'!"

"'That's true,' Picasso said with a smile. 'The Germans often wanted to see me, but under the pretext of admiring my paintings. I gave them my business card and a reprint of 'Guernica,' and told them: 'Keep it as a souvenir.'"

"Some American newspapers say that you have joined the Communist Party, that this is just your fantasy, and that you have said 'Art and politics have no relationship.'"

At this point, Picasso's facial expression suddenly became very tense:

"I have not said such a thing, it is all rumors."

"Do the Communists understand your paintings?" an American lady asked.

"Some understand, some don't. It's like some people understand Einstein, and some don't. Wait a minute, this is very important, let me give you a written statement."

A few minutes later, Picasso returned, tore two pages from his pocket diary, which had a few lines of hastily written words in pencil:

"What do you think an artist is? Is it just someone who has eyes is a painter, who has ears is a musician, who has heartstrings is a poet, who has muscles is a boxer? No, an artist is also someone with political views. He contemplates world events, and then reflects its meaning in his art. How can a person isolate themselves from humanity and the world? No, the purpose of art is not only to decorate houses and halls; painting is also a weapon to defend against the enemy and attack the enemy."

"Do you understand this explanation?" Picasso asked eagerly.

"It couldn't be clearer. If people don't understand your paintings, they will definitely understand these words."

### 法国大画家  毕加索的艺术观  世界艺术家侧影

    法国大画家
    毕加索的艺术观
    世界艺术家侧影
    胡品清译
    这位天才、这位最著名的近代画家并不是我所想像的那么样。他黑的皮肤，白的头发，深的皱纹和宁静的神态都充分表现了慈和。
    他有一个大绘画室在巴黎的市中心，那屋子很高，有黑的栋梁，白的天花板。他有一只瘦长的狗叫卡斯北克，毕加索告诉我们说，卡斯北克是高加索山的最高峰。他墙上和画架上有许多画，全透露着愁惨的气氛，主要的色泽是灰、黑、和深蓝。有一张是一个曼陀铃形的女郎，斜倚在沙发上；另一个却像一个弯曲的烟囱。有的是描绘地震混乱中却带着神秘的和谐，这便是我们久仰的毕加索。战争，侵略和恐怖已使他更年青，更有力。
    “有一个关于你的故事是真的吗？一天，一个德国特务拿着一张翻印的“格尔尼卡”（一个曾遭德国惨炸的西班牙城）问你：“这是你的作品吗？”你回答说：‘不，是你的’！”
    “‘是真的，’毕加索笑着说：‘德国人常常要来看我，但是却借口说是要欣赏我的画，我送给他们我的名片和翻印的‘格尔尼卡’；并且对他们说：‘留着吧，纪念品。’”
    “有的美国报纸说你曾加入共产党，这件事不过是你的幻想，而且说你曾说过‘艺术和政治是没有关系的。’”
    这时毕加索面部表情突然变得很紧张：
    “我没有说过这种话，都是谣言。”
    “共产党懂得你的画吗？”一个美国小姐问。
    “有的懂，有的不懂。如同有人懂爱因斯坦，有人不懂一样。等一等，这是很重要的，让我给你们来个书面谈话。”
    几分钟以后毕加索回来了，从袖珍日记上撕下了两页，上面有几行铅笔写的草率的字迹：
    “你以为艺术家是什么？只要有眼睛便是画家，有耳朵便是音乐家，有心弦便是诗人，有筋肉便是拳师吗？不，艺术家也是有政治观的人，他静观世界大事，然后他把它的意义在艺术中反映出来。一个人怎么能同人类和世界隔绝呢？不，艺术的目的不仅在装饰房屋和厅堂、绘画也是防敌和攻敌的武器。”
    “这样解释你明白吗？”毕加索急切的问。
    “再清楚没有了。假如人们不懂你的画，这些字他们一定能懂。”
