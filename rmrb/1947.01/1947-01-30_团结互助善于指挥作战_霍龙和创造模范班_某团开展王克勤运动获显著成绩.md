    Unity, Mutual Assistance, and Skillful Command in Combat
    Huo Longhe Squad Creates a Model Platoon
    A Certain Regiment Achieves Remarkable Results in the Wang Keqin Movement

    [This newspaper's dispatch from the JiluYu Front, 29th] Another model squad has emerged on the JiluYu Front – the Huo Longhe Squad. This squad participated in the battles of Juancheng, Huaxian, Juye, and Yutai, with only one minor injury in the entire squad. In the Juye campaign, the squad captured over 60 enemy soldiers, seized 35 rifles, 10 small cannons, and 5 light machine guns. After the battle of Yangzhuang in Yutai, the squad was fully equipped with Japanese weapons. When this reporter visited the squad on the Yutai front, the entire squad was actively learning how to use the new weapons. Squad leader Huo Longhe was a railway worker. When he was a militia member in his hometown of Shouyang, he operated along the Zhengtai Railway for many years and has rich combat experience. In commanding operations, he is good at appropriately allocating work based on the current situation, tasks, and the abilities of each soldier. During attacks, he is good at using political offensives, mobilizing prisoners on the battlefield to shout to their original units. He is very careful in searching while advancing, and even enemies hiding in sweet potato cellars cannot escape. Battlefield discipline is also very strict. In peacetime study, the squad focuses on researching specific methods to defeat the enemy, and completes technical preparations before entering battle. Huo Longhe also pays great attention to unity within the squad in leadership, mobilizing veteran fighters to help liberated fighters politically, and mobilizing newly liberated fighters to help veteran fighters with certain skills, respecting each other. His conclusion is: "We must all get along to make progress and eliminate the enemy."

    [This newspaper's dispatch from the JiluYu Front, 29th] After a certain regiment of the Eighth Route Army on the JiluYu Front launched the Wang Keqin Movement, it has achieved remarkable results in the Yujin Campaign. Since the publication of the "Launch the Wang Keqin Movement" editorial in the Liberation Daily, the regiment has convened two discussions among company and platoon cadres and mutual aid group leaders. Before the start of the campaign, the first battalion of the regiment launched a battalion-wide mutual aid initiative to solve the difficulties of newly liberated fighters with shoes and socks. Mutual aid groups for marching were generally organized during marches, and fatigue from marching did not affect combat. Ji Xuefeng, the leader of a machine gun company's mutual aid group, was liberated in the Juancheng Campaign. Learning from Wang Keqin, he combined bravery with skill and paid attention to using terrain and features. In the Yutai peripheral annihilation battle, his squad chased the enemy for more than four miles without a single casualty. In the Pengge battle, Bu Shaotian, the leader of his squad's mutual aid group, used Wang Keqin's battlefield rescue method to rescue the wounded Feng Zhanchun during the battle without hindering the combat. In the Pengge battle, the third squad completed three tasks in a row – breaking through the front line, developing in depth, and attacking bunkers – because of good battlefield mutual assistance, without a single casualty. Wang Jinbao, liberated from Dayang Lake, conducted shouting under the help of the mutual aid group, causing three Chiang Kai-shek soldiers to lay down their weapons.

    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】冀鲁豫前线又出现了一个模范班——霍龙和班。该班曾参加鄄城、滑县、巨野、鱼台等战役，全班仅一人微伤。巨野一役，该班俘敌六十余人，缴步枪三十五枝，小炮十门，轻机枪五挺。鱼台杨庄之战后，该班已全部换成日式装备。记者在鱼台前线访问该班时，全班正积极学习使用新武器。班长霍龙和是个铁路工人，他在寿阳故乡当民兵时，曾在正太沿线活动多年，有丰富的战斗经验。在指挥作战中，善于根据当时情况任务和每个战士的能力，适当分配工作。他在进攻中善用政治功势，动员战场上的俘虏向他的原部队喊话。在前进中搜索甚为仔细，钻进红薯窑里的敌人也不能幸免。战场纪律亦甚严整。该班平时学习着重研究战胜敌人的具体办法，在进入战斗前完成技术准备。霍龙和在领导上也极注意班内团结，发动老战士在政治上帮助解放的战士，又发动新解放战士在某些技术上帮助老战士，相互尊重，他的结论是：“要大家都能闹到一块，才能进步，才能消灭敌人。”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】冀鲁豫前线八路军某团开展王克勤运动后，在鱼金战役中已取得显著成绩。自解放日报发表“开展王克勤运动”的社论后，该团曾召集连排干部及互助组长进行两次讨论。战役开始前该团一营曾发起全营大互助，解决了解放过来的新战士的鞋袜困难。在行军中普遍组织了行军互助组，没有因行军疲劳影响战斗。机枪连互助组长纪学奉是鄄城战役中解放过来的，他向王克勤学习，使勇敢与技术结合，注意了利用地形地物。鱼台外围歼灭战，他班追击敌人四里多路，没有一个伤亡。彭阁战斗，他班互助组长卜绍天运用王克勤班战场救护办法，在战斗中救护了负伤的冯占春，没有防碍战斗。彭阁战斗中，三班由于战场互助作得好，没有一个伤亡，接连完成突破前沿、纵深发展、攻击碉堡的三次任务。大阳湖解放过来的王金保在互助组的帮助下，进行喊话，使三个蒋军放下武器。
