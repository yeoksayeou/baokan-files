[This report] From TASS, Moscow, January 19th: Vikentyev recently published an article in Pravda stating: The French presidential election concluded with the victory of the democratic camp and the defeat of the reactionaries. The French Communist Party did not nominate its own candidate and decided to support the Socialist candidate, which is faithful to their firm policy of uniting all democratic forces. This decision guaranteed the election of the Socialist Auriol. Although the presidential election is important, it did not overshadow another major political event that occurred during the heat of the presidential election preparations, namely Blum's visit to Britain, which the French people felt was somewhat sudden. During the first stage of the London talks, the British and French newspapers enthusiastically reported on the "imminent signing of a British-French military alliance" and the "imminent conclusion of a customs union." However, the official communique issued after the London talks did not explain the pretext for currently proposing the conclusion of a British-French military alliance, only stating that the purpose of the future alliance is to prevent the possibility of German aggression. If we recall that French public opinion has been anxiously monitoring Britain's policy towards Germany recently, especially the plans for the restoration of German military power that are widely circulating in certain London political circles, we will realize that the issue of a British-French military alliance was raised to reassure French public opinion. However, the comments on this issue appearing in the British newspapers are unlikely to dispel French concerns. For example, the conservative *Daily Mail* asserted that this meeting is the latest step towards the British-French alliance proposed by Churchill in 1940. The Labour Party's *Daily Herald* felt it necessary to recall Churchill, the initiator of the British-French alliance. The French people are unlikely to forget Churchill's proposal in 1940, which in fact amounted to the loss of French sovereignty. So what are the results of the London talks? As the communique shows, it is clearly not glorious for France, namely that France cannot hope to obtain coal from the Ruhr in the short term. Thus, the British-French talks have once again proved that London has no intention of giving up the possibility of exerting pressure on France by exploiting France's economic dependence on Ruhr coal.

　　维克罗夫评法总统选举
    民主阵营赢得胜利
    法共忠实民主团结支持奥勒尔当选
    英谋压制法国伦敦谈判未获得成就
    【本报讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：维克罗夫顷于真理报著文称：法国总统选举以民主阵营胜利和反动派失败而结束。法国共产党人未提出自己的候选人，并且决定支持社会党候选人，这是忠实于他们团结各民主力量之坚定政策，此种决策保证了社会党人奥勒尔的当选。总统选举虽然重要，可是并未掩盖住在总统选举准备方酣之时发生的另一政治大事，即勃鲁姆之访英，法国人民对此曾略感突然。当伦敦谈判的第一阶段，英法报纸激情的报导着“英法军事同盟即将签订”、“关税同盟即将缔结”。伦敦谈判后所发表的官方公报则并未说明目前提出缔结英法军事同盟问题之借口，仅称将来同盟之目的是在预防德国侵略的可能性。如果我们追忆到近来法国舆论焦虑地监视英对德政策，特别是在伦敦政界某方面所广泛流行的有关德国军力恢复之计划，就会想到英法军事同盟问题之被提出是为了安定法国舆论。然而出现在英国报纸上的对此问题之评论，很少可能消除法国之忧虑。例如保守之《每日邮报》断言此次会议是走向邱吉尔一九四○年建议的英法同盟之最近的门路。工党《每日前锋》报觉得有必要追忆作为英法同盟发起人的邱吉尔。法国人民很少可能忘记一九四○年邱氏之建议，事实上等于丧失法国主权。那么伦敦谈判的结果是什么呢？像公报所表现的一样显然，这对法国实无光彩，即法国在短期内不能希望自鲁尔获得煤。如此，英法谈判又一次证明伦敦丝毫无意放弃利用法国经济对鲁尔煤之依赖而施压力于法国的可能性。
