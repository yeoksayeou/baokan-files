　　Cultivate More Correspondents
    Guo Zhifu
    Among the supplements, I am most interested in: "What I Saw in the Liberated Areas," articles commemorating Lu Xun, "The Past and Present of Chuandi," "Chairman Mao Sending His Son to Study at the Labor University," "Book and Newspaper Reviews," "What Do Frontline Soldiers Need?" "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "Greatness in the Ordinary"... Generally speaking, the supplement of November 20th, especially the supplement of this month's 10th, I feel is even more rich in content, concise, fresh, and interesting. If you add some short articles about "Writing Guidance," and select one or two outstanding typical manuscripts within a few days for specific analysis and research, this may cultivate more correspondents and teach all naive writers.
    I need both practically helpful and interesting articles, and what I like most is an article that is both practical and interesting.
    I can still understand the language used.
    This is my opinion, I wonder if you agree?

　　培育更多的通讯员
    郭直夫
    副刊中我最感兴趣的是：“我所见到的解放区”、追念鲁迅的文章、“川底的今昔”、“毛主席送子住劳动大学”、“书报评介”、“前线战士需要什么？”“王贵与李香香”、“平凡中的伟大”……笼统的说，十一月二十日，特别是本月十日的副刊，我觉得更是内容丰富、简短、新鲜有趣。如果再添点关于“写作指导”的短小文章，选拔几天内一二个出色典型的稿子，作具体的分析研究，这样也许能培育出更多的通讯员，教导一切幼稚的写作者。
    有切实帮助的；有趣的文章，二者我都需要，最喜欢的是一篇文章，既实用且有趣。
    所用语文，我还能够看懂。
    这就是我的意见，未知以为然否？
