　　Introduction to New Democratic Countries
    Romania
    Romania transformed from a Nazi satellite state into a new democracy in 1945. Located in the northeast of the Balkan Peninsula, it covers an area of 294,060 square kilometers and has a population of 17.9 million.

    Romania's most important resource is oil, with production ranking fourth in the world. Its grain production ranks first in Europe, earning it the title of "Europe's Granary." Strategically, it was the central springboard on Germany's "Eurasian Axis" route and an outpost for German aggression. Therefore, after Germany defeated France in 1940, its war plans focused on Romania. When Romania accepted the Soviet Union's demand to return Bessarabia and Bukovina (Bessarabia was seized from the Soviet Union by Romania during World War I), Germany openly oppressed the Romanian people. At the same time, the leader of the Romanian Iron Guard, Antonescu, launched a coup with Nazi support, formed a fascist cabinet, appointed himself Prime Minister, announced a pro-German policy, and joined the "Axis" on November 23. In 1941, it declared war on the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, officially becoming a German satellite state.

    At that time, the Romanian people and various democratic parties consciously organized themselves, forming several anti-fascist groups, including the Patriotic Front, the Democratic Front, and the Anti-Fascist Committee. They resolutely fought against the Antonescu regime and Nazi Germany. Between 1942 and 1943, strikes and sabotage actions were launched throughout Romania, and guerrilla warfare broke out in the northern mountainous areas.

    In the summer of 1944, the Soviet army defeated the German-Romanian allied forces and entered Romanian territory. King Michael I sued for peace and accepted the Soviet Union's proposal of "unconditional surrender and the establishment of democratic politics." On August 23, Antonescu was arrested (and executed by firing squad on June 1 last year). The next day, a provisional coalition government was formed, including various democratic parties and the Communist Party. On September 13, Romania officially signed an armistice agreement with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the Communist Party put forward a "Draft Program for National Democratic Politics," demanding that all democrats jointly establish a democratic front and organize a genuine democratic government. This quickly gained unanimous agreement from all parties. On October 12, the Communist Party, the Farmers' Front, the General Confederation of Labor, the National People's Party, the National Peasants' Party, and other organizations formed the "National Democratic Front" and discussed the formation of a coalition government. During this process, reactionary elements within the Peasants' Party and the People's Party obstructed it in many ways.

    In March 1945, the coalition government led by Groza was established, and Romania embarked on a new path.

    After the Groza government was established, it changed its anti-Soviet policy to a pro-Soviet policy and peacefully completed land reform, thoroughly eliminating feudal remnants and distributing more than 2 million acres of land to farmers. As a result, in 1945, the cultivated area increased by 2 million acres compared to previous years. It also faithfully fulfilled the decisions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference and rejected the notes of interference in Romania's internal affairs from Britain and the United States. It held a general election on November 19 last year. As a result, the Democratic Party Bloc (Communist Party, Socialist Party, Left-wing Liberal Party, Farmers' Front, and People's Party, etc.) won an overwhelming victory, occupying 348 of the 414 seats in the new parliament.

    Recently, Romania has been engaged in economic reconstruction. The parliament has passed a bill nationalizing banks, and the Ministry of Agriculture is drafting several bills related to the vital interests of farmers, such as "prohibiting the free sale of land," "agricultural workers' associations," and "agricultural loans." The people of the new Romania are enthusiastically participating in the reconstruction effort.

　　新民主国家介绍
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚于一九四五年已从过去纳粹的附庸国变为新民主主义国家了。她在巴尔干半岛的东北，面积为二十九万四千六十方公里，人口达一千七百九十万。
    罗马尼亚的资源以石油为最重要，产量占世界第四位，其谷物产量则居欧洲首位，故有“欧洲谷仓”之称。在战略上，她是德国“欧亚横轴”路线上跳板的中部，又为德国向外侵略的前哨阵地。因此，一九四○年，德国打败法国之后，她的作战计划，就向着罗马尼亚。当罗马尼亚接受了苏联要求退还比萨拉比亚及布科维纳（按比萨拉比亚是第一次大战时罗马尼亚夺自苏联）的时候，德国就公开压迫罗国人民。同时，罗国铁卫团首领安多莱斯哥在纳粹支持下发动政变，组织法西斯内阁，自任总理，宣布亲德政策，并于十一月二十三日，参加“轴心”。四一年就向苏英美宣战，正式沦为德附庸国。
    当时罗国人民及各民主党派都自觉的组织起来，成立若干反法西斯的集团为爱国阵线、民主阵线与反法西斯委员会，他们都坚决地与安多莱斯哥政权及纳粹德国进行着斗争。一九四二——四三年间，罗国各地发起罢工运动与破坏行动，在北部山岳地带展开了游击战。
    一九四四年夏，苏军击败了德罗联军，进入罗境，罗王米琪尔乞和，接受了苏联所提出的“无条件投降，建立民主政治。”八月廿三日，安多莱斯哥被捕（于去年六月一日枪决），第二天，组成了包括各民主党派与共产党的临时联合政府。九月十三日罗国与英、美、苏正式签订停战协定，接着共产党就提出“全国民主政治纲领草案”，要求一切民主分子共同建立民主阵线，组织真正的民主政府。而且很快的获得了各党派一致同意。十月十二日，共产党、农民阵线、总工会、国家人民党、全国农民党等组织“全国民主阵线”，并讨论组织联合政府。在这过程中，农民党与人民党的反动分子曾多方阻挠。
    一九四五年三月，以格罗查为首的联合政府成立，罗马尼亚从此走上了新生的道路。
    格罗查政府成立后，改变了仇苏政策为亲苏政策，又以和平方式完成了土地改革，彻底扫除了封建残余，将二百多万英亩土地分给农民，因此在一九四五年耕地面积比以往数年增加了二百万英亩。并且忠实地履行了莫斯科外长会议的决定，拒绝了英、美干涉罗国内政的照会，于去年十一月十九日举行大选。结果，民主政党集团（共产党、社会党、自由党左派、农民阵线及人民党等），赢得压倒的胜利，他们在新议会四百十四席中占三百四十八席。
    最近罗马尼亚正在进行经济复兴建设，国会已通过银行收归国有法案，农业部正草拟“禁止土地自由售卖”、“农业工人协会”、“农贷”等数种有关农民切身利益的法案。新罗马尼亚人民都热烈地参加复兴工作。
