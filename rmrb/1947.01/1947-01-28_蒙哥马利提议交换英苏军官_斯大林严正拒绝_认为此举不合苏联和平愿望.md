    Montgomery Proposed Exchanging British and Soviet Officers
    Stalin Sternly Refused
    Believing This Was Inconsistent with the Soviet Union's Desire for Peace
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 26th: TASS, Moscow, January 24th: Paris Radio reported: Stalin has rejected Marshal Montgomery's proposal to exchange military officers between Britain and the Soviet Union. Regarding this matter, TASS obtained the following information from qualified sources: During Marshal Montgomery's visit to Moscow and talks with Stalin, he raised the issue of exchanging students from military academies between the Soviet Union and Britain. Stalin replied that exchanging officers between the two countries would be a good thing, but it was not appropriate to do so now. Stalin explained: In peacetime, standardization of training and weaponry, or the exchange of officers, regardless of its significance, could lead people to interpret such military measures as preparations for war. At the initiative of the major powers, the United Nations has already passed a resolution for universal arms reduction. A completely different mood has been created in public opinion, and the current exchange of officers would run counter to this mood. Stalin also pointed out that various newspapers are criticizing Britain and the United States, saying that they are preparing for the exchange of officer training and weapons standardization. The Soviet Union does not want to be warned as well. If the Soviet Union also takes this path, it may give the impression that, regardless of whether this approach is good or bad, the major powers will create a perception in public opinion that there is no basis for preventing war. The exchange of officers is not in line with the Soviet Union's desire for peace.

    蒙哥马利提议交换英苏军官
    斯大林严正拒绝
    认为此举不合苏联和平愿望
    【新华社延安二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：巴黎电台息：斯大林已拒绝蒙哥马利元帅关于英苏两国交换军官的提议。关于这一问题，塔斯社自有资格人士方面获得情报如下：蒙哥马利元帅访问莫斯科与斯大林谈话时，曾提出苏英两国交换军校学生的问题，斯大林曾答复说，交换两国的军官是很好的事，但是现在来这样作是不适当的。斯大林解释道：在和平时期进行训练与武器的标准化，或交换军官，不管其有何种意义，可能使人们把这种军事措施，解释为准备战争。按照列强的倡议，联合国组织已通过普遍缩减武器的决议，在社会舆论中，已造成一种完全不同的情绪，而现时交换军官，则与此种社会舆论的情绪相反。斯大林还指出说，各种报纸都在骂英国与美国，说他们在准备交换军官训练与武器标准化，苏联不愿意让人也警告他，如果苏联同样走上这条道路，有可能发生一种印象，不管这种办法是好是坏，但是各大列强会在社会舆论中造成一种定见，即是没有根据以防止战争。交换军官，是不适合于苏联爱好和平的意愿的。
