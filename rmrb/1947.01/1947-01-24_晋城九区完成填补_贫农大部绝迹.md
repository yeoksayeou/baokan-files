(This report from the Taiyue region, dated the 21st) The Jincheng Ninth District, since launching its land redistribution movement on December 20th of last year, has completely realized "land to the tiller" in 20 days. This time, a total of 14,951 mu of land was redistributed, accounting for 12 percent of the district's total land. Many villages have eliminated poor peasants. For example, in villages like Beipingzhai and Caihe, all poor peasants have risen in status. In Renlingtou Village, middle peasants average 4.5 mu per person, poor peasants average 4 mu per person, hired laborers average 4.5 mu per person, while the 11 landlord households that were targeted for redistribution still average 7.1 mu per person. In Gaodu Town, where there is less land, only 37 poor peasant households remain, accounting for 9 percent of the town. The process began with enabling peasants to understand "land to the tiller," followed by a renewed outpouring of grievances. The peasants of Qutou universally demanded land, quickly cutting off the feudal vestiges, and clearing up the land and property accumulated by the peasant associations, which was then fairly and reasonably distributed to the peasants.

　　晋城九区完成填补
    贫农大部绝迹
    【本报太岳二十一日电】晋城九区自去年十二月二十日起，二十天的填补运动，已完全实现耕者有其田。此次共清算出土地一万四千九百五十一亩，占全区土地百分之十二。很多村庄已消灭贫农。如北平寨、蔡和等村，贫农全部上升。人岭头村，中农每人平均四亩半，贫农每人平均四亩，雇工每人平均四亩半，而被清算后的十一户地主，平均每人亦有七亩一分。土地较少的高都镇，亦仅留下三十七户贫农，占全镇百分之九。其进行的过程，首先使农民了解耕者有其田，随即进行重新诉苦。渠头农民普遍要地，很短时间内便割掉封建尾巴，并清理了农会积存的土地财产，公平合理的分配给农民。
