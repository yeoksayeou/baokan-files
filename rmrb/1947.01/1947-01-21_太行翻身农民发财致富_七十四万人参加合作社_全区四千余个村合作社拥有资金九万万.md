Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 16th: Our special correspondent Zhu Muzhi reports: The cooperative economy in the Taihang area has become an important component of the people's economic life in the entire region. There are currently over 4,000 village cooperatives in the region, with 740,000 members and over 900 million in capital. According to statistics from seven counties including Huguan, Lincheng, Lucheng, and Licheng, cooperatives have increased by 2.35 times compared to 1944, the number of members has increased by 1.73 times, and capital has increased by about 7 times. One of the major features of the cooperative movement is the widespread development of small-scale cooperatives, which gradually organize scattered and isolated small-scale agricultural production. For example, in Beiliu, Licheng, one village has thirteen small-scale cooperatives. In Yangjingdi Village, Pingshun, all 190 households participated in small-scale cooperatives. There are two reasons for the vigorous development of the cooperative movement: First, emancipated peasants have accumulated savings in production, and at the same time, a large amount of labor has been saved through mutual aid in labor, which provides an objective basis for the development of the cooperative movement. Second, the cooperatives themselves have implemented the policy of supporting agricultural production and developing rural side occupations, truly serving the people's prosperity and serving them. For example, in Dongdengjian Village, Xiyang, there were 126 livestock before the Anti-Japanese War, but only 22 remained due to enemy looting during the war. Through the cooperative's organization of people's production, there are now 104. The Lucheng County Cooperative opened a blacksmith shop, which helped farmers throughout the county solve more than 70% of their agricultural tool needs last year. A village cooperative in Beiliu, Licheng, organized people's side-occupation production and established more than ten small workshops such as sugar mills, flour mills, tofu workshops, grinding mills, oil presses, woodworking factories, small textile factories, cotton gins, blacksmith shops, and pharmacies. Among them, the woodworking factory alone made 60 looms and 51 spinning wheels in six months and renovated 32 native looms. It not only solved the local textile tools but also made a profit of 3.89 million. The Chaihu Village Cooperative in Xingtai organized women to spin and weave, earning a profit of 280,000 in three months, and the entire village can now supply its own cloth. The Lucheng County Cooperative organized women to weave straw hats, and the women earned the equivalent of 1,000 stones of millet; it also implemented the exchange of necessities such as salt and cloth for the people's products to overcome the phenomenon of buying high and selling low in rural areas, so that the masses would not suffer losses. According to materials from seven counties including Licheng, Pingshun, Wuxiang, and Shexian, the profits earned by the cooperative in organizing people's production accounted for 76% of the total profits; the profits earned by the cooperative's own operations accounted for only 20%. In Beiliu Village, Licheng, the income earned by the people relying on cooperative profits accounted for 26.5% of their total income, while Baichi Village in Huguan accounted for 46.1%. Pingshun County as a whole accounted for 31.4%.

　　太行翻身农民发财致富
    七十四万人参加合作社
    全区四千余个村合作社拥有资金九万万
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十六日电】本社特派记者朱穆之报导：太行区合作社经济已成为全区人民经济生活中之重要组成部分，全区现有四千余个村合作社，七十四万社员，资金达九万万元以上。据壶关、临城、潞城、黎城等七个县统计，合作社较四四年增加了二点三五倍，社员增加了一点七三倍，资金则增加约七倍。合作事业的重大特色之一是小型合作社的普遍发展，它使散漫孤立的小农生产逐渐组织起来。如黎城北流，一村就有十三个小型合作社。平顺羊井底村，一百九十余户全部参加了小型合作社。合作事业蓬勃发展之原因有二：一、为翻身农民在生产中获得积蓄，同时在劳动互助中节省了大量劳动力，使合作事业发展有了客观基础。二、为合作社本身，执行了扶助农业生产，与发展农村副业的方针，真正为人民致富和服务。如昔阳东登溅村，抗战前有牲口一二六头，战时由于敌人劫掠，仅余二十二头，经合作社组织人民生产，现已有一○四头。潞城县合作社开铁匠炉，去年帮助全县农民解决了百分之七十以上的农具。黎城北流一个村合作社，组织人民副业生产，成立了糖坊、粉坊、豆腐坊、磨坊、油坊、木工厂、小纺织厂、轧花厂、铁匠炉、药铺等十余小型作坊，其中木工厂一处，六个月中做了六十架织布机，五十一辆纺车，改造了三十二架土机。不仅解决了当地纺织工具，且获利三百八十九万元。邢台拆虎村合作社，组织妇女纺织，三个月获利二十八万元，全村穿布已可自给。潞城县合作社，组织妇女编草帽，妇女获利合小米一千石；并实行以盐、布等必需品换取群众生产品，以克服农村中买贵卖贱现象，使群众不受损失。据黎城、平顺、武乡、涉县等七个县材料，合作社组织人民生产所获利益，占全部利益的百分之七十六；合作本身经营所获利益，仅占百分之二十。在黎城北流村，人民依靠合作社营利所获得的收入，占其全部收入的百分之二十六点五，壶关白尺村占百分之四十六点一。平顺全县则占百分之三十一点四。
