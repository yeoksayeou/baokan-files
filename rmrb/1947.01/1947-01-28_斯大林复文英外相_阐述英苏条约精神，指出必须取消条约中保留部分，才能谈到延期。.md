    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 26th: Moscow, January 25th broadcast, TASS released a notice regarding the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance stating: On January 18th, British Foreign Secretary Bevin sent a note to Soviet Premier Stalin. Bevin in his note first mentioned the meeting between Stalin and Montgomery, expressing his "great pleasure," and continued: "What troubles me is the impression Your Excellency has formed, that in London the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance has been regarded as a 'lump of ice' hanging in the air, or that the 'Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance has been falsely accused of being replaceable by the United Nations.' What surprised me even more was the article published in the Truth newspaper on January 15th, which considered this to be my view, referring to a sentence I said in a broadcast on December 12th, 'Britain cannot bear obligations to anyone other than the UN Charter.' " Bevin falsely claimed that this was not his view, and in conclusion notified that the British Foreign Office would publish a statement on January 20th denying the Truth newspaper's article, and attached the statement to the note so that Stalin could comment in advance.

    On January 22nd, Stalin sent Bevin a letter stating: "I have received Your Excellency's note of January 18th. It must be admitted that Your Excellency's statement that 'Britain cannot bear obligations to anyone other than the UN Charter' can be exploited by enemies of Anglo-Soviet friendship. I clearly explain the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance, regardless of those reservations, no matter how these reservations weaken the treaty, but the existence of this treaty places considerable obligations on our two countries. The statement made during the conversation with Alexander on September 17, 1946, (Editor's note: Alexander was the British First Lord of the Admiralty who visited the Soviet Union) has fully explained the issue and there is no room for misunderstanding at present. Now I clearly state my personal view on the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance. As for the British government's statement, especially raising the issue of extending the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance, if such an extension is seriously pursued, then before this treaty is extended, it should first be revised to eliminate those reservations that weaken it. Only after implementing this procedure can we seriously discuss the extension of the treaty."

    Editor's note: The Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance was signed in May 1942, with a validity of twenty years. One of the reserved conditions is that the validity of the Treaty of Alliance shall last until one party decides that the international organization is safe.

    斯大林复文英外相
    阐述英苏条约精神，指出必须取消条约中保留部分，才能谈到延期。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科二十五日广播，塔斯社发表关于英苏同盟条约的通知内称：一月十八日，英外相贝文，向苏联内阁主席斯大林发出照会。贝文在照会中首先提及斯大林与蒙哥马利的会谈，并表示“很高兴”，继称：“我感到不安的，是阁下所发生的印象，说在伦敦已把英苏同盟条约视为悬在空中的‘冰块’，或说‘英苏同盟条约，已被诬为可以由联合国所代替’。一月十五日真理报所登载的论文，使我更为惊异的是，认为这是我的观点，指我在十二月十二日广播中所讲的一句说，‘英国除对联合国宪章外，无论对谁也不能负义务’。贝文佯称这不是他的观点，并于结语时通知说，英外交部将于一月二十日发表否认真理报论文所述的声明，并将该声明附于照会之后，俾斯大林能事先说明。
    一月二十二日，斯大林向贝文发出一文，内称：“我已获悉阁下一月十八日的照会，应当承认，阁下的声明说‘英国除对联合国宪章，无论对谁也不能负义务’。我认为这一声明，能够为英苏友谊的敌人所利用，我明白解说英苏同盟条约，不管有那些保留条件，不管这些保留怎样减弱了本条约，但这一条约的存在，对我两国担负相当义务，在一九四六年九月十七日，与亚历山大谈话时，（编者按：亚历山大为英海相曾访问苏联）的声明，已把问题完全解释明白了，并没有在目前发生误会的余地。现在我很清楚的阐明了我个人对于英苏同盟条约的观点。至于讲到英政府的声明，特别提出英苏同盟条约延期的问题，假使认真进行此种延期的话，那末在这一条约尚未延期之前，首先应当把它修改，取消那些减弱这一条约的保留，实行这种手续后，才能认真谈论条约的延期。                  
    编者按：英苏同盟条约签订于一九四二年五月，有效期二十年，其中保留条件之一，为同盟条约之有效期限直至一方决定认为国际组织安全时为止。
