The family members of soldiers in Langpo write letters to the front, encouraging their sons to protect their good life.
[This newspaper's Changzhi news] Since the land reform check last winter, the poor military families in Langpo Village, Licheng Third District, have been completely emancipated. In the movement, the military families of all classes were also appropriately taken care of. On the 16th of this month, military families of all classes in the village wrote letters to their children at the front during the Lunar New Year, explaining the changes in their families. Zhang Zhenhai, a lower-middle peasant, wrote to his son Chouhai: "We have been allocated another eight and a half mu of good flat land, six rooms, two shi and two dou of grain, five big dou of wheat, half a donkey, and 16,000 yuan. Including clothes and furniture, it is worth more than 300,000 yuan." Talking about the scene of the New Year this year, he wrote: "As long as I can remember, this is the first good year our family has had. This is given to us by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. You must concentrate on fighting Chiang Kai-shek at the front to protect our good life and live up to Chairman Mao." Zhang Enke, a rich peasant military family member with feudal remnants, wrote to his son Shengqi: "The problem of our family has been solved, you don't need to worry. If we were to exploit the poor like our family used to do, all the family property we have now would not be enough to pay off the debt. But the masses in the village think you have done a good job, so they only counted eight mu of land, and left twenty-five mu. There are eight people in the family, and we are still a rich peasant." Finally, he said: "If you don't fight well, you will be letting down the masses in our village." The village cadres also wrote a letter to the Fiftieth Regiment to be forwarded to eight soldiers from his village, Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Zhiqi, Wang Fuwang, etc., saying: "The feudal landlords in our village have been overthrown, and we have taken back 208 mu of land, 154 shi of coarse and fine grains, 313 sheep, 43 rooms and 33 buildings, and a lot of silver ingots and silver dollars. The military families and retired veterans have all received the top share of the fruits. You don't need to worry about your families, just concentrate on fighting the reactionaries."

Farmers in various parts of Southern Hebei warmly care for military families during the New Year
[This newspaper's Weixian, 29th dispatch] During the Lunar New Year, the support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-military-families movement has become a hot and great movement due to the thorough emancipation and increased awareness of the peasants. Chenhai Elementary School in Wuyi County has stipulated that Sundays are support-the-army days. In three support-the-army days, the whole school collected 4,700 jin of firewood and distributed it to the families of military workers. Teachers and students of Tietouzhuang Elementary School in Fudong dressed up for publicity and raised 143,000 yuan in seven days, which was distributed to frontline soldiers and used to comfort military workers' families. Xiyuan Village, Guantao County, specially invited military workers' families to a dinner on New Year's Eve. Village cadres also humbly sought the opinions of military families. Children's groups and sisters' groups carried water, swept courtyards, and did odd jobs for military families. Liufang Village, Jize County, has made doing odd jobs for military families a system, and has also decided that village cadres will visit them every five days to express their condolences and check on the above work. Hao Zhikui, the village chief of Xijie Village in the city, raised 1,700 jin of rice, wheat, and coarse grains, 1,000 jin of firewood, and 110 jin of scallions, salt, and vermicelli, as well as 120,000 yuan in local currency, which was distributed to military families according to their family situation in three grades. Guan County and Wuyi County both clearly pointed out in their instructions on support-the-army work that, in addition to providing material preferential treatment to military families as New Year's gifts, they should also hold New Year's Eve gatherings for military families, hang honorary lanterns, honorary plaques, and paste honorary couplets for military families. On New Year's Day, they should collectively pay New Year's greetings to military families, and villages that house wounded and sick soldiers should hold tea and wine parties with the wounded and sick soldiers.

Zhao Shuming gives up good land to take care of the labor difficulties of military families
[This newspaper's Weixian, 29th dispatch] Zhao Shuming, a model of supporting the army in Zhao Xinwang Village, Jing County, exchanged good land with another military family. After Zhao Shuming was elected as the support-the-army cadre, he was extremely concerned about the difficulties of the families of martyrs and soldiers, especially those who had no labor force. During this land reform movement, when the farmers' association distributed land, he was allocated six mu of land that was close to his home and had good soil, while another military family with no labor force was allocated a piece of bad land far from their home. Zhao Shuming said generously at the conference: "It is difficult for people who have no labor force to work, and the land is bad. I feel uneasy about this, because this is unfair to the soldiers who are bravely killing the enemy at the front. I am willing to exchange the good land that I should have been allocated with their family." The masses applauded and welcomed him, calling him a model of supporting the army. At the same time, under his influence, other village cadres also became active in supporting the army.

The Border Region Government hosts a Spring Festival banquet for military families
[This newspaper's dispatch] On the first day of the Lunar New Year, all the comrades of the Border Region Government Club, in the midst of fluttering snow, beat gongs and drums, held big red New Year's cards, and personally visited more than 50 homes of military families and martyrs' families to pay New Year's greetings. The next day, the Border Region Government prepared a meal to entertain all the military and martyrs' families, village cadres, and retired veterans in the village. During the meal, Director Yuan Zhihe delivered a speech to wish them a happy New Year after their emancipation, and called on the whole village to work hard this year to produce and carry out health campaigns.

Merchants Wen Jie actively donate money, and retired veterans produce to support the army
[This newspaper's Changzhi news] When the merchants of this city paid their business tax on the 13th, it happened that our army on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front annihilated another three and a half brigades of the enemy. The good news inspired the merchants and people of the city. They immediately recalled the harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies and the business depression during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the puppet Yan army. Now, the market is prosperous and business is booming. The merchants said: "Our business is good because our army is fighting well." Some people also said: "If we eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries like this, victory will come sooner." Chen Baogui, the manager of Xingtaichang, said: "The troops are eliminating the enemy day and night at the front, and we must donate some money to them to protect our liberated area and make our business more secure." The store has donated all the 50,000 yuan saved from food and clothing in the past two months. That afternoon, the shops on the east and west streets alone donated 1,200,000 yuan and 1,600 yuan.

[Another dispatch] Zhao Mingsan, Zhou Qian, Qin Shangkuan and other three retired veterans who were demobilized and settled in Herun Town, Lin County last year have now been thoroughly emancipated. Zhao and others have been in the army for many years and have a deep affection for the revolutionary army. Therefore, during the Lunar New Year, they each donated 10,000 yuan of their savings from their emancipated life to the brothers on the front line to express their revolutionary enthusiasm.
