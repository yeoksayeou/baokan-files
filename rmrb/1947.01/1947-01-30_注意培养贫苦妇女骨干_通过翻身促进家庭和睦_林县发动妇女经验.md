(This dispatch is) from our Changzhi correspondent on the 27th: Lin County has paid attention to mobilizing women in the mass movement and has achieved great results. Since the beginning of the winter land reform inspection, the county leadership has attached importance to women's mobilization and has overcome the view from top to bottom that "women are not capable and women don't count as the masses." In the past two months, the awareness of the broad masses of women has been rapidly raised, and they have actively participated in the struggle, making the peasant forces unprecedentedly strong. The following experiences have been gained: 1. Target the landlords and inspire them to complain about their suffering. As long as women are absorbed into the movement, the broad masses of women can be mobilized. Because the most deeply affected by the landlords' oppression and exploitation of the peasants are the women. Many men were forced to flee by the landlords, and the women were left at home to support the family, endure beatings and scolding. Many women became maids and concubines for the landlords because they were forced to pay rent and interest. These sufferings of women have been brought out in many villages through casual chats and talks about the past. In these chats, the most painful cases were identified and used as typical examples to inspire more women. For example, in Xia Zhaiqu village, 20 activists emerged from casual chats, and through their connection, they mobilized another 37 people. At a meeting in Erliang village where 40 women complained about their suffering, they couldn't get started at first. Later, after talking about everyday life and the hardships of famine years, everyone naturally began to complain about their suffering. At a meeting in Baixiangjing where more than 200 women complained about their suffering, they also couldn't get started at first. After one typical woman complained about her suffering, everyone began to complain. After complaining about their suffering, the women recognized the crimes of the landlords and joined the struggle with the men. 2. The land reform movement has promoted family harmony. For example, after the women of Ren village demanded packages and silver dollars from the landlord on their own, the men immediately paid attention to the women and took the initiative to call on the women to participate in the meetings. The women of Datun village reflected: "After the land reform, we have food and clothing, and we are no longer angry." Some families were not harmonious, which affected the land reform, so everyone concentrated their efforts to educate and resolve the problems. For example, in Xia Zhaiqu village, two men beat their wives. At a mass meeting, everyone kindly criticized them, and the two men were greatly moved. They also made self-criticisms and corrected their behavior, and the problem was solved harmoniously. Wang Suiming's wife in Datun village treated her daughter-in-law harshly and did not allow her to attend the meeting. After continuous persuasion by the women cadres, the mother-in-law changed, and the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law became harmonious. 3. Special needs of women should be taken into account when distributing the fruits of victory. Although the family is an economic unit, women have their special needs, and it is necessary to take care of them when distributing the fruits of victory. For example, women in Wangjian village were given silverware and jewelry, and each person in Datun village was given a piece of clothing. This not only encouraged the enthusiasm of the women, but also enhanced their self-esteem. 4. A large number of poor women cadres can be cultivated, and women's organizations can be developed. This is very necessary for the complete liberation of women. For example, in Xia Guo village, 13 women who had fled famine as tenants were found to complain about their suffering, and three activists, Qin Shaohua, Wang Xueying, etc., were discovered. After several struggles, they became the most prestigious leaders among women. The practice in the Seventh District is to unite poor women. When there are few people, they participate in the farmers' association. When there are many people, they establish women's federations and elect poor activists as cadres. The masses are very satisfied with this practice.

    注意培养贫苦妇女骨干
    通过翻身促进家庭和睦
    林县发动妇女经验
    【本报长治廿七日电】林县在群运中注意发动妇女，获得很大成绩。冬季翻身检查开始，该县领导上即重视妇女发动，并自上而下的克服了“妇女不顶事，妇女不算群众”的观点，两月来，广大妇女的觉悟迅速提高，积极的参加了斗争，使农民力量空前壮大，并取得以下经验：一、对准地主，启发诉苦，只要吸收妇女参加，广大妇女是可以发动起来的。因地主对农民的压迫与剥削，受苦最深刻的是妇女，许多男人被地主逼的远逃，在家顶门应事，挨打受骂的是妇女；很多妇女给地主当使女、小老婆，都是因还不起租息所迫。妇女这些苦处，许多村子是用扯家常，说时光的漫谈方式扯出来的，在扯拉中发现最痛苦的，抓紧进行典型诉苦，启发更多妇女。如下翟曲便是从漫谈中涌现出廿个积极分子，经过他们串通，又发动起卅七人；二量村四十个妇女开大会诉苦，开头诉不起来，以后经谈家常、扯灾荒年的苦时光，大家即自然的诉起苦来；白相井二百多妇女诉苦大会上，开始也是诉不起来，经一典型诉苦，大家便都诉起来。经过诉苦，妇女们认清了地主的罪恶，便和男人一块参加斗争。二、通过翻身运动，促进了家庭和睦。如任村妇女单独跟地主要出包袱、银洋后，男人马上便重视了妇女，开会主动叫妇女参加；大屯村妇女反映说：“翻了身有吃有穿，都不生气啦”。有些家庭不和，影响翻身，大家就集中力量，教育解决。如下翟曲村有两个男人打老婆，一次群众大会上，大家善意的对他们进行了批评，二人大受感动，也作了检讨、纠正，便和谐地解决了，大屯村王随明妻，苛待儿媳，不让她参加开会，经妇女干部连续劝说，这婆婆便转变了，婆媳关系顿形融洽。三、分果实时应照顾妇女的特殊要求。家庭虽是一个经济单位，但妇女有其特殊要求，分果实时，给以照顾是很需要的。如王建村妇女分银器、首饰，大屯村每人分了一件衣服，这样不仅鼓励了妇女的积极性，而且增强了她们的自尊心。四、可大量的培养出贫苦妇女骨干，并发展妇女组织。这对妇女的彻底解放很需要，如下郭村找十三个佃户逃荒的女人诉苦，发现秦少花、王雪英等三个积极分子，经过几次斗争，她们便在妇女中成为最有威望的领袖，七区的作法是把贫苦妇女团结起来，人少时参加农会，人多时即成立妇联会，选举贫苦积极分子当干部，这种作法群众非常满意。
