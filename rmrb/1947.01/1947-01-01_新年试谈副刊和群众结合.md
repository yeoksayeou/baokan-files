　　A Preliminary Discussion on How Supplements Can Integrate with the Masses
    Lin Xi
    Today is New Year's Day, and as usual, it seems like we should have a "New Year's Message." But empty words are useless, so let's talk about an issue that's relevant to all of us.
    The predecessor of Chinese newspapers was the "Di Chao" (imperial gazette), which was mostly for officials, discussing the affairs of emperors. The first modern newspaper was the Hong Kong-based "Universal Globe," which was mostly for officials and merchants, discussing Sino-foreign affairs and business news. I'm too lazy to look up when supplements first appeared, but I remember when I could understand newspapers, I was reading the "Saturday" style leisure pieces in the Shanghai "Shi Bao," which were definitely not understandable by the general public. Later, new literary publications became popular, but their circulation was still limited to intellectual circles.
    The emergence of Party newspapers in various regions, starting with the New China Daily, truly created supplements that completely stood on the side of the people. But what they inherited was inevitably the old tradition of intellectual circles. The comprehensive "New China Supplement" did not appear until 1941, and the circle expanded to include workers, students, and some civil servants. However, as the tide of striving for democracy rose, it was felt that the circle was still too small. Thus, the issue of integrating supplements with the masses was raised, moving towards brevity and liveliness, while also creating "Social Services." The fourth edition of the Liberation Daily made great contributions to pioneering and improving people's culture. And after the September 1st review last year, it was also felt that "our supplements are not sufficiently integrated with the masses" (Liberation Daily, October 23rd of last year), and columns such as Reader Service and Thought Forum were opened. This publication is a small brother, just learning to walk, but the encouragement from our readers has already been great.
    So, how can we truly achieve the integration of supplements with the masses? Comrade Qiao Mu hoped that we could publish fewer dispensable "intellectuals' discussions," "but fill the tens of thousands of words of the page every day with various authors, readers, and tens of thousands of contributions and letters with various content and forms, closely conveying various aspects of life and combat, conveying the noise of the masses, like a thriving garden." This means that the supplement's garden should be completely open to the masses, allowing a large number of diverse contributions and letters to pour in from the masses.
    However, the masses don't come so easily. How can we invite everyone to come? We have painstakingly explored this. The experience of running the New China Mailbox tells us that as long as we regularly and consistently answer some practical questions for the masses, the masses will keep coming. The experience of "Social Services" has further increased our confidence: even a small thing like placing a "public advertisement" can make more readers treat the newspaper as their own. Zhang Henshui, a veteran of newspaper publishing for over 20 years, shared a secret: "Figure out what readers want at a certain time, and give it to them." The British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" also underwent a reform last year. They no longer put on a stern face and only talk without listening, but came up with various ways to serve the masses. Their film reviews tell workers how to find good movies, which is very effective. This all illustrates a truth: to get the masses to come, you must convey their lives and struggles, satisfy their needs, and enthusiastically and consistently serve the masses.
    Therefore, this year, this publication plans to follow this direction. After we prepare a bit, we plan to put out "People's Service" every one or two issues, to enrich Reader Consultation, Everyone's Talk, Brief Replies, etc., and open up some new things, so that we can do our small part to help everyone out a little. In addition, we plan to allocate some space as a place for cadre comrades to exchange thoughts and experiences in their study. To relieve the hunger for knowledge, we will not forget to pick some fruits of culture, science, and various subjects to offer; since many readers are concerned about Yan'an, various liberated areas, and the situation in areas outside the liberated areas, we should naturally reprint and introduce them at any time. The literary nature will not be diluted by the comprehensive nature. We hope that submissions will use a variety of literary forms as much as possible, but we will pay more attention to conciseness and brevity. In 1947, all aspects of the self-defense battles, liberation, and production of the 30 million people in the entire border region should leave their mark. Let everyone work together to portray them with simple and vivid mass language. We open all columns to readers. Submissions are not judged based on the maturity of the writing, but as long as there is substantial content, if you agree, we can help modify the writing.
    Let's draw a rough sketch like this, and later we will definitely modify it at any time according to the opinions of our reader comrades. But if this sketch is to become a reality, it will mostly depend on the hands extended from the authors and readers. Writing articles, offering opinions, asking questions, organizing forums on this publication..., these are all things we are looking forward to. Let us all work together to make this small garden noisy and prosperous!

### 新年试谈副刊和群众结合

　　新年试谈副刊和群众结合
    林曦
    今天是元旦，照例似乎应当来一篇“新年献辞”。可是空话无益，还是让我们来谈谈与咱们大家都有点关系的一个问题吧。
    中国报纸的前身是“邸抄”，那多半是给做官的看的，谈的是皇帝老爷们的事情；第一份现代式的报纸是香港的《寰球报》，那多半是给官商们看的，谈的是华洋事务和商情。什么时候开始有副刊，懒得去查它了，只记得自己能看懂报纸的时候，还读的是上海《时报》上那种《礼拜六》式的茶余酒后的消闲小品；不消说，也不是一般大众能看得懂的了。后来新文艺性的刊物风行了，但那风行的圈子也还是局限在知识分子里面。
    由新华日报打开头的各地党报出现，才真正有了完全站在人民立场的副刊。但所承接的却不能不是一个知识分子圈子的旧传统。综合性的“新华副刊”迟至四一年才出现，圈子算是扩大到工人、学生和一部分公务员中了；可是到争民主的浪头高涨起来以后，却又觉得圈子还是太小。于是提出了副刊的与群众结合问题，一面走向简短活泼，一面创办“社会服务”。解放日报的四版，对开创和提高人民文化上是很有供献的。而去年九一检讨过后，也感到“我们的副刊和群众结合不够”（去年十月二十三日该刊），开辟了读者服务，思想座谈等栏。本刊是个小兄弟，刚刚学步，但读者对我们的鼓励也已经很大了。
    那么，究竟怎样才能作到副刊与群众结合呢？乔木同志希望是能少登些可有可无的“智识分子的议论”，“可是每天万把字的版面上挤满各种作者读者、各种内容形式的几十万稿件信件，切实而紧凑的传达着生活和战斗的各个侧面，传达着群众的嘈杂，好比生意旺盛的花园一样。”这就是说要把副刊的园地完全开放给群众，让各种各样的稿件信件能大量地从群众中涌来。
    然而群众不是那么容易来的。怎样才能请得大家来？我们曾苦心摸索过一番。办新华信箱的经验告诉我们，只要经常而坚持地给群众解答一些切身问题，群众是会不断来的。“社会服务”的经验又增加了信心：那怕是代登一条“大众广告”那样小的事，就可以使更多的读者把报当做自己的报。二十多年的办报老手张恨水先生讲了一个秘诀：“看准一个时期读者要什么，就给他什么。”英国兄弟党的《工人日报》去年也有一番革新，他们再不板起面孔，专说不听，而想出各种各色的花样替群众办事。他们的电影评介告诉工人们如何去找好看的电影，很有成效。这都说明一个真理：要群众来，得传达出他们的生活和战斗，得满足群众的需要，得热心而经常地给群众办事。
    所以今年的本刊，就打算本着这一个方向办。等我们稍微筹备一下之后，打算每隔一两期出一次“人民服务”，把读者顾问、大家谈、简复等更充实起来，并开辟一些新的东西，使能尽我们的一点微劳，多少给大家办点儿事。另外打算划出一些篇幅，作为干部同志们思想学习、经验交换的谈心的地方。为了解救知识上的饥渴，我们不会忘了采摘些文化科学以及各科知识的果品来奉献；许多读者既然关心延安、各解放区以及解放区以外各地的情况，我们自然应当随时转载、介绍。文艺性不会因综合而冲淡，我们希望来稿尽量采用形形色色的文艺形式，只不过要更注意到精练短小。一九四七年中，全边区三千万人民的自卫战斗、翻身、生产的各个侧面，都应当留下面影，大家动手来用朴素生动的大众语言刻画起来吧，我们把所有的栏目开向读者。来稿不以文字的成熟与否作取舍准则，只要有切实内容，同意的话，文字我们可以帮助修改。
    就这样画个草图吧，以后我们一定根据读者同志们的意见随时修改。可是这个草图要想变成实际，大部分得靠从作者读者们中伸出来的手。写稿、提意见、提问题、组织对本刊的座谈……，这都是我们顶盼望的，让我们大家一同来把这个小小的花园搞得人声嘈杂，生意旺盛起来吧！
