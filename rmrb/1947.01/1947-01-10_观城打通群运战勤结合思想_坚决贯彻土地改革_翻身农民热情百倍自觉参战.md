[This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 8th] The combination of land reform and wartime support work has achieved successful experience in the experiment in the Fourth District of Guancheng, and this experience is now being promoted throughout the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. According to Comrade Li Gu, Minister of the Organization Department of the Guancheng County Party Committee: Guancheng initially believed that the two major tasks of land reform and wartime support were contradictory, believing that it was a time of war, and although land reform was a major event, it was difficult to do well without a relatively large lull in the fighting. However, as the war developed day by day, the task of wartime support became heavier and heavier. The main cadres of the county and district constantly took turns carrying stretchers; the cadres and masses in the villages and the militia were busy day and night running errands, and stretchers and carts were always in short supply. They were constantly making crash efforts, and the leaders could not think of a good way to solve the problem. At this time, they realized the long-term nature of the war, and were still doubtful about whether land reform and wartime support could be done together, so they decided to first conduct land reform in the fourteen villages in the southwest of the Fourth District of Guancheng as a test. Immediately, cadres were assigned, and the division of labor between the front and rear was clarified. One part was fixed to focus on land reform, and the other part was preparing (investigating and understanding materials) while also working on wartime support. First, in four or five villages such as Qianxiagou, Dongliuhai, Chenzhuang, and Gongzhuang, a heated movement began. When the struggle in Gongzhuang was just beginning, unexpectedly, the district cadres did not vigorously supervise, and quickly completed the wartime support task. This time, the stretchers went to Puyang, without food for two days, and walked for two consecutive nights, more than two hundred miles, without a single runaway, which was unprecedented since the war. In the process, they also incidentally completed tasks such as paying public grain, collecting iron, and establishing village headquarters. The overturned masses completed complex tasks with high enthusiasm, transforming the dull atmosphere. Facts have proved that land reform is not only not contradictory to the task of wartime support, but has become a driving force for the broad masses to enthusiastically participate in wartime support. Based on this experience, the leadership immediately clarified that land reform was the center, combined with wartime support and other work, and put forward the slogans "light fires in every village, smoke everywhere," and "redress grievances, complain of suffering," determined to carry out universally in the entire Fourth District. After that, in five days, thirty-eight villages launched a vigorous land reform movement. The poor masses who participated in the movement received grain, livestock, farm tools, houses, and land. From then on, their enthusiasm for supporting the self-defense war increased a hundredfold. The militia of Chenzhuang, Gongzhuang, and Dongxunkou automatically helped our army scout out enemy positions. The militia of Yanzhuang and Xiagou were very happy to help our army transport firewood and rice, etc., all of which were conscious manifestations of the overturned peasants. Now everyone clearly realizes that wartime support should not only be combined with land reform, but also that wartime support cannot be done well without land reform; it is difficult to support a long-term war without satisfying the demands of the peasants.

[This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 7th] After Guancheng universally launched the movement to combine land reform and wartime support, the enthusiasm of the masses to turn over and protect their land was high, young adults joined the militia to go to the front line, and wartime support work proceeded smoothly. Before land reform in Chenzhuang in the Fourth District, only three people participated in the militia. This time, after a thorough change, after the masses were distributed the fruits of the struggle, more than twenty young people joined the militia to go to the front line. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops advanced to four miles from Chenzhuang, the masses, under the bombing of Chiang Kai-shek's artillery, automatically cooperated with the county brigade to transport grain, and cooperated with the army to carry out guerrilla warfare. Because of land reform in Qinzhuang, twelve young peasants immediately joined the militia for alert duty. Before land reform in Xiagou, the morale of the masses was low, and wartime support work was difficult to carry out. When the struggle began, the masses became active, struggling on the one hand and actively supplying the front on the other. The five sets of stone mills in the village were grinding military rice day and night, completing two thousand catties every day. The old people also actively went to the "old and young people's class" to serve in shifts. The village headquarters had complete rice and flour, supplying passing soldiers. The militia bought new bullets, wiped their guns, defended the fruits of the struggle, and prepared to go to the front line at any time. More than forty villages in the entire Fourth District are now carrying out struggles, and wartime support work is also unprecedentedly smooth. When carts and stretchers are needed, they are quickly gathered after a notification.

    观城打通群运战勤结合思想
    坚决贯彻土地改革
    翻身农民热情百倍自觉参战
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】土地改革与战勤工作结合进行，在观城四区的实验中，已获得成功经验，现此一经验，正在冀鲁豫全区推行。据观城县委组织部长李古同志报导：观城开始认为土地改革与战勤两大任务是矛盾的，认为现在是战争时期，土地改革虽是一件大事，但没有比较大的战争空隙很难搞好。可是战争一天一天的发展着，战勤任务也越来越重，县区主要干部不断的轮流带担架；村内干部群众与民兵，日夜为支差奔忙，担架、大车老是供应不暇，终日突击，领导上也想不出好办法解决。这时才认识到战争的长期性，对土地改革与战勤是否能一齐做的问题，仍是怀疑，乃决定先在观城四区西南十四个村搞土地改革试试看。当即配备了干部，明确前后方的分工，一部固定专搞土地改革，一部一面作准备工作（调查了解材料），一面作战勤。首先在前夏沟、东刘海、陈庄、弓庄等四五个村庄，热火朝天的运动起来了。弓庄斗争正在开始时，出乎意外，区干并没大力督促，很快就完成了战勤任务。这次担架到濮阳、两天没吃饭，而且接连走了两夜，二百多里路，没有一个逃跑的，这是战争以来空前未有的。在这当中，还附带的完成了缴公粮、募铁、建立村指挥部等任务。翻身群众以高涨的热情，完成了复杂的工作，转变了沉闷空气。事实证明了土地改革不仅不与战勤任务矛盾，而且成了广大群众热烈参加战勤的推动机。领导上根据这经验，即明确提出土地改革为中心，结合战勤与其他工作，提出“村村点火，到处冒烟”，“有冤伸冤，有苦诉苦”的口号，决心在全四区普遍进行。此后，五天的时间里，三十八个村，轰轰烈烈的展开了土地改革运动，参加运动的贫苦群众得到粮食、牲口、农具、房子、土地，从此他们对支援自卫战争的热情百倍地增高了。陈庄、弓庄、东巡口的民兵，自动帮助我军侦察敌情，阎庄、夏沟民兵很高兴的帮助我军运柴米等，都是翻身农民自觉的表现。现在大家明确的认识到，战勤不仅应该结合土地改革来进行，而且不进行土地改革，就搞不好战勤工作；不满足农民的要求，就难以支持长期战争。
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】观城普遍开展贯彻土地改革与战勤结合运动后，群众翻身保田情绪高涨，壮年纷纷参加民兵上前线，战勤工作进行顺利。四区陈庄土地改革前，只有三人参加民兵，这次彻底翻身，群众分到斗争果实后，即有二十余青年参加民兵上前线。蒋军进至陈庄四里路时，群众在蒋军大炮轰击下，自动配合本县大队，运走粮食，并配合军队进行游击。秦庄因进行土地改革，十二个青年农民立即参加了民兵进行警戒。夏沟在土地改革前，群众情绪低落，战勤工作进行困难，斗争开始，群众活跃起来，一面斗争，一面积极供应前方，村中五盘碾子，日夜不停碾军米，每天完成两千斤，老人们也积极到“老少班”轮流服务，村指挥部米面齐全，供应过路军人。民兵新买了子弹，擦了枪，保卫斗争果实并准备随时赴前线。全四区现已有四十多个村庄正进行斗争，战勤工作也空前顺利，要大车、担架等，一通知很快就集齐。
