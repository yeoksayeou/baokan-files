Experiences in Adjusting Relations Between Cadres and the Masses During the Land Reform Check-up in Xiazhuang Village, Pingshun

　　At the beginning of the winter land reform check-up in Xiazhuang Village, the first obstacle encountered was the gap between the cadres and the masses: the masses did not believe that the cadres could lead them to a thorough liberation, so they lacked enthusiasm; the cadres, on the other hand, felt that the masses could not be mobilized and also lacked confidence. After the district cadres discovered this situation, they immediately convened a meeting of village cadres for self-criticism, and proposed "talk about achievements, talk about shortcomings." After everyone discussed it, the main problems existing between the cadres and the masses were discovered: First, during the rent reduction struggle in 1944, the cadres selfishly distributed the fruits of labor unfairly. For example, the village head privately bought eight acres of good land with the fruits of labor, which made the masses very dissatisfied. This time, when it was proposed to thoroughly liberate themselves, the masses felt that the struggle would be in vain, so they lacked enthusiasm. Second, the masses were dissatisfied with the cadres' administrative command style. For example, the public security director criticized himself, saying: "I used to like to use tough methods and would put 'hats' on the masses at the slightest provocation, so the masses were unwilling to approach me." After self-criticism, everyone realized that they were divorced from the masses, but they also felt that being a cadre had many difficulties: First, they were also poor people. Is it not right to get something for being a cadre and spending effort? Second, there are many work tasks, and we are eager to complete them, but some people just don't do it, so we have no choice but to use administrative orders. As a result, we are not good with both sides, criticized by superiors and opposed by the masses. The district cadres immediately proposed: "Are personal interests consistent with the interests of the masses? Who is the work for?" After repeated discussions, everyone understood that work is the business of the masses. As long as the masses are enlightened to understand this principle, they will complete the work without administrative orders. Cadres and the masses are the same, and should not be special. For example, the village head said: "Now I realize that selfishness and administrative orders are to be divorced from the masses. This time, we must be selfless and implement democracy to lead the masses to a thorough liberation."

　　After the cadres' thinking was thoroughly cleared, they proposed: "Where you lost it, find it there." Everyone personally went to the masses who were most dissatisfied with them, made self-criticism face to face, and resolved misunderstandings face to face. For example, the village head did not take good care of the military dependent Wen Xiu in the past. This time, he personally made a self-criticism and helped him carry water, and the relationship between the two sides became harmonious.

　　After resolving misunderstandings individually, a mass meeting was held, and the cadres made self-criticisms in front of the masses. The masses were greatly moved. Military dependent Lao Huang said: "My past ideas were also wrong. I thought that having my child join the Eighth Route Army was for others, and I only complained about the lack of preferential treatment. Now I understand that if it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, I wouldn't be able to live in such a good house. Since the village head can admit his mistakes, we should all think about it. The fault is not on one side." Regarding the fruits of labor that the cadres bought more of, the masses unanimously believed that the cadres were also poor people, and they had indeed suffered a lot for the masses. After careful calculation, it was not too much, but it was just not done through the masses at the time. Now that we have made it clear, we should not ask them to return it. No matter what the cadres are like, they are always our own people, as long as they correct their mistakes.

　　After the estrangement was broken, the land reform check-up was quickly carried out, and the masses were very enthusiastic. They automatically conducted discussions, and the rent and interest problems concealed by landlord Zhang Ergou and other seven households for several years were all liquidated.

　　平顺下庄翻身检查中调整干部群众关系的经验
    下庄村在冬季翻身大检查开始，首先遇到的障碍，便是干部与群众间存在着隔阂：群众不相信干部能领导他们彻底翻身，因此劲头不大；干部则认为群众发动不起来，亦缺乏信心。区干部发现此种情况后，即召开村干部会进行检讨，并提出：“谈功劳谈缺点”。经过大家圪扯，发现干部与群众间存在着的主要问题：一、四四年减租斗争时，干部自私分配果实不公，如村长在果实中私自挑买了八亩好地，群众都很不满，这次提出彻底翻身，群众都认为斗争也是白出力，所以劲头不大，二、群众不满干部行政命令的作风，如公安主任检讨说：“我过去好要硬办法，动不动就给群众戴上‘帽子’，因此群众不愿接近我。”经检讨，大家虽觉悟到自己是脱离群众，但又认为当干部也有许多苦衷：一、自己也是穷人，当干部费了工，出了力得些东西还不应该吗？二、工作任务多，咱急待要完成，有些人就是不干，不由的就非用行政命令不行，结果是两头不落好，上级批评，群众反对，区干部当即提出：“个人利益与群众利益是不是一致的？工作是为了谁？”经再三讨论，大家弄通了，工作就是群众的事情，只要启发群众认识了这个道理，不用行政命令也会完成，干部和群众一样，不应特殊。如村长说：“我现在才认识了自私自利，行政命令是要脱离群众的，这次一定要大公无私，实行民主，领导群众彻底翻身。”
    干部思想彻底打通后，即提出：“那里丢了那里找，”各人都亲自去找对自己最不满的群众，当面检讨，当面解圪塔，如村长过去对军属文秀照顾不好，这次亲自检讨，并帮助他担水，双方关系即转融洽。
    经过个别解圪塔后，又召开群众大会，干部都在群众面前作了检讨，群众大为感动，军属老黄说：“我过去想法也不对，认为孩子当八路军是给别人干，光嫌优待少，现在想通啦，不是八路军我就住不上这样好的房子，村长能承认自己不对，我们大家也该想想，不对不是一方的”。关于干部多买的果实，群众一致认为：干部也都是穷人，他们为群众也确实吃苦不少，细算起来也不算多，不过就是当时没通过群众吧，现在既然说通了，咱们也不应叫他们退，干部不管怎样，总是咱自家人，只要改过就行。
    隔阂打破后，翻身检查即迅速开展，群众劲头很大，自动进行酝酿，地主张二狗等七户几年来隐瞒的租息问题，都被清算出来了。
