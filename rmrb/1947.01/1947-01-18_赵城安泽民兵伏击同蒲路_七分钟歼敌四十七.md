　　Zhao cheng Anze militia ambushes Tongpu Railway
    Seven minutes annihilate forty-seven enemies
    [This paper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch] The Zhao cheng First District, led by District Armed Committee Director Comrade Ma Guangjian, ambushed the northward-bound Yan army's 66th Division on the Tongpu line at Shitan Village. In seven minutes, they annihilated forty-seven enemies, creating a miracle of militia annihilating the enemy. Shitan Village is across the river from the northern section of the Tongpu Railway. The terrain is extremely dangerous, with a difficult-to-climb rocky mountain on one side and the Fen River on the other. The north side of the road is low-lying, about 700 meters long. Between Shitan Village and the railway is a convex-shaped mound, about 300 meters apart, opposite the recessed earth. Ma Guangjian's rotation team learned on December 29th that the Yan army was heading north along the Tongpu Railway. They combined with the Anze militia expedition team, totaling more than 30 people, and ambushed here. When a large group of Yan soldiers gathered in the depression, they commanded the militia to act in unison, and suddenly bullets and grenades rained down. At this time, the Yan army was in chaos, shouting and running around, and some were even pushed into the Fen River. Seeing that the objective had been achieved, Ma Guangjian and others took the opportunity to withdraw. When the Yan army's follow-up troops used more than 20 machine guns to cover a battalion's forced crossing of the Qin River and attacked the concave mound, Ma Guangjian and others had already retreated to rest nine miles away. According to reports from the people of Shitan Village, this battle killed 21 Yan soldiers, seriously wounded 26, and slightly wounded 8. More fell into the Fen River.
    [This paper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch] The leaders of the Taiyue Military Region issued a commendation to the agile and enemy-annihilating Youji team of the Fourth District of Huoxian. The Youji team of the Fourth District of Huoxian, which operates in the suburbs of Huoxian County and on the railway line to its north, cooperated with a certain district Youji team on December 18th to capture 11 enemy soldiers, including a platoon leader, between Tuisha and Shishi. On the afternoon of the 27th, more than 10 people ambushed on the east side of the railway south of Podi. When more than 200 leading new recruits of the 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division of the enemy passed by, they suddenly pounced on the enemy, killing and wounding 5 enemies, and capturing a radio station and more than 30 batteries. We suffered no casualties.

    七分钟歼敌四十七
    【本报太岳十六日电】赵城一区以区武委会主任马光健同志为首的轮战队，于同蒲线上石滩村伏击北上之阎军六十六师，七分钟内歼敌四十七名，创造民兵歼敌的奇迹。石滩村隔河系同蒲路北段，地形极为险要，一面是不易攀登的石山，一面是汾河，路北低凹，共约七百米长，石滩村与铁路间有一凸形土堆，相距约三百米，与凹土相对。马光健轮战队，在十二月二十九日，得知阎军沿同蒲路北上，便与安泽民兵远征队结合，共三十余人在此埋伏，待阎军大队结集在凹地时，便指挥民兵一致动作，顿时枪弹掷弹如雨点打过去，此时阎军大乱，乱叫乱跑，更有挤掉在汾河边的。马光健等见目的已达，乘机撤退，待阎军后续部队用二十余挺机枪掩护一个营强渡沁河，向凹形土堆攻击时，马光健等早已撤退在九里外休息了。据石滩村老百姓报告，这一仗打死阎军二十一名，重伤二十六名，轻伤八名，掉在汾河里的更多。
    【本报太岳十六日电】太岳军区首长通令嘉奖机警歼敌的霍县四区游击队。活动于霍县城郊及其以北铁路线上的霍县四区游击队，十二月十八日曾与某区游击队配合，在退沙、什茨间俘敌排长等十一名。二十七日下午又以十余人设伏于坡底以南之铁路东侧，当敌七三师二一八团之带领新兵干部二百余人通过时，即以突然动作向敌猛扑，毙伤敌五名，缴获电台一部，电池卅余筒，我毫无伤亡。
