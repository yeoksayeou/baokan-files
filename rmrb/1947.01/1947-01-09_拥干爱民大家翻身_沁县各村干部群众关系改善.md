    Supporting Cadres and Loving the People, Everyone Overturns Their Lives
    Relationship Between Cadres and Masses Improves in Qin County Villages
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue 7th Dispatch] During the rent reduction movement in Qin County, the relationship between cadres and the masses was improved, and the united slogan of "supporting cadres and loving the people, everyone overturns their lives" was put forward. In the past, in the guerrilla areas when the enemy and puppets were in power, in the so-called "second-line areas" where the masses were mobilized, it was discovered during the winter rent reduction movement that the work in many villages was deadlocked due to the cadres' style of doing everything for them. As a result, there was much discussion, and some people indiscriminately asked, "Do we want cadres or do we want the masses?" Amid such accusations, some villages were taken advantage of by feudal forces to provoke conflict, and some cadres were struggled against. During the first seven days of inspection in Ni Village, almost everything discussed was the shortcomings of the cadres; while the cadres were somewhat unconvinced, forming a temporary opposition between the masses and the cadres. Later, some villages also showed similar biases. Therefore, the slogan "supporting cadres and loving the people, everyone overturns their lives" was put forward to guide the cadres to enlighten the masses' spirit of class unity. As a result, the cadres apologized to the masses, and the masses recalled the cadres' merits in leading them to overturn their lives. Wang Liuhaizi, the director of the Wangjia Yu Armed Committee, did not distinguish between objects during the mass movement and was dictatorial in everything. The masses gave him the nickname "Old Sixth Shift," but when he reflected on himself, he said in public, "Being a cadre of the masses means being dictatorial towards landlords and bullies; but if I am dictatorial towards the masses, then I am a running dog of landlords and bullies. Now I resign publicly and am willing to apologize to everyone from door to door." When the masses saw that he knew he was wrong, they said intimately, "What you did was indeed too much; but you were resolute and brave in resisting Japan, and many times when the enemy entered the village, you rushed to the front to desperately hold them back, and your contribution to covering the entire village's retreat was great. Now that you have corrected your mistakes, we still support you as our leader to lead us to overturn our lives." When the cadres of Xicheng Village apologized to the masses, the district cadres also accompanied them to admit their mistakes to the masses. Because the administrative command style of the village cadres was closely related to the undemocratic nature of the district cadres. Therefore, the district cadres also happily accepted the education of the masses. As for the villages where cadres were struggled against and punished, such as Lingnangou, under the instigation of the feudal clique, the village cadre Wang Guixiao was beaten severely. Afterwards, the liberated farmer Wang Xinyou said painfully, "Even if Wang Guixiao's work style is bad, we will not argue for him; but for eight years he fought against the feudal forces regardless of his life and death, and which grievance and reasoning didn't require him to be at the front? The evil landlords tried to frame him in every possible way, but now our own people are beating him!" Therefore, the policy of "supporting cadres and loving the people, everyone overturns their lives" has become the way for Qin County to resolve the relationship between cadres and the masses in the mass movement, and many villages have thus gained unity and continued to struggle against feudal exploiters.

    拥干爱民大家翻身
    沁县各村干部群众关系改善
    【本报太岳七日电】沁县查减运动中，改善了干部与群众的关系，提出“拥干爱民大家翻身”的团结口号。过去敌伪在时的游击区，发动群众中所谓“二线区”的，在冬季查减运动中，曾发现很多村子因干部的包办代替作风，致使工作陷于僵局。于是议论纷纷，有人竟不分皂白的提出“要干部还是要群众”？在这样的责难声中，有的村子被封建势力乘隙挑拨，将部分干部斗争了。倪村头七天检查中，几乎全是谈干部的缺点；而干部则有些不服气，形成群众与干部间暂时的对立。后来有些村子亦同样有些偏向。于是便提出“拥干爱民大家翻身”，诱导干部启发群众的阶级团结精神。于是干部向群众道歉，群众追忆干部为自己带头翻身的功绩。王家峪武委会主任王六孩，在群众运动中不分对象，专横一切，群众送他个绰号叫“老六班”，但当他反省时，当众说：“当群众的干部，就要对地主恶霸专横；而我对群众专横起来，就是当了地主恶霸的狗腿了。现在我当众辞职，并愿挨门挨户的向大家道歉。”群众见他知错，便亲密的说：“你作的事，确实太过了些；但你抗日坚决英勇，许多次敌人进村，你都是跑到前头拚命顶住了，掩护全村撤退的功劳很大，现在你既改过，我们还拥护你当我们的领袖，领导我们翻身。”西城村干部向群众道歉时，区干部亦陪着向群众承认错误。因为村干部的行政命令作风，都和区干部的不民主息息相关。所以区干部亦愉快的接受群众的教育。至于干部被斗争惩办的村庄，如岭南沟在封建集团的挑拨下，将村干部王桂小痛打一顿，事后翻身农民王新友痛心的说：“就说王桂小的作风坏，我们也不为他争辩；但八年来他不顾生死的与封建势力斗争，那一次诉苦说理不要他在前头，恶霸地主百般陷害他，现在自己人却打起他来了！”所以“拥干爱民大家翻身”的方针，便成为沁县解决群运中干部与群众关系的途径，许多村子都因此而获得了团结，与封建剥削者继续斗争。
