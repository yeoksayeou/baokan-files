　　Night Raid on Xinxiang Airport, Destroying Three Chiang Planes
　　Democratic Nation-Building Detachment Blows Up Enemy Train
　　[This dispatch from Changzhi, 19th] The Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district’s local armed forces have been very successful recently in annihilating small groups of enemy forces through guerrilla warfare. In ten days, they fought eight battles, killing and wounding 60 enemies, capturing 481 alive, seizing 28 light and heavy machine guns, 366 rifles, 16 Browning pistols, one small cannon, over 21,000 rounds of ammunition, six telephones, and nine warhorses, and destroying a total of 19 enemy blockhouses. Our Democratic Nation-Building Detachment once attacked the Gao Village Station in Qi County and blew up an enemy train. On the night of the 10th, our Fifth One Unit launched a night raid on the Chiang army's Xinxiang Airport, destroying three American-made Chiang planes. During the ten days of fighting, many heroes who killed the enemy emerged. Comrade Wang Wende, the seventh squad leader of the seventh company of the Nation-Building Detachment, was the first to rush into the enemy's bunker in the Zhao Family Factory annihilation battle, capturing one machine gun and eight rifles. Zhao Qiliang, a machine gun squad soldier, crawled into a bunker with his bare hands during the fiercest part of the battle, capturing two prisoners alive and seizing one light machine gun. Comrade Ren Jinsheng, a bugler of the third company of the × unit, immediately rushed forward after blowing the charge, seizing one enemy light machine gun. They fully demonstrated the spirit of new heroism in the patriotic self-defense war.
