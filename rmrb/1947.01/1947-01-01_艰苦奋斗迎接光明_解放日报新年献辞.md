　　Greet the Bright Future Through Hard Struggle
    New Year's Message from Liberation Daily
    Since the Japanese invaders surrendered in August of the year before last, after more than a year of exploration and experimentation, the situation in our country, the road of struggle for our people, the methods of struggle, and the future of struggle have all become clear. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the American imperialists came to replace Japanese imperialism, wanting to destroy China and turn it into a colony of American imperialism. Replacing Wang Jingwei, the puppet of the Japanese fascists, came Chiang Kai-shek, a running dog of American imperialism, resolutely implementing a policy of selling out the country, waging a civil war, and dictatorship, selling China to the American imperialists, obtaining the help of American imperialists to carry out an unprecedented civil war in order to maintain his fascist dictatorial rule, attempting to make the people of the whole country the slaves of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families. Therefore, the Chinese people must fight to the death for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland against the two national enemies, the U.S. and Chiang. Because the main means used by the U.S. and Chiang is civil war, the main form of struggle on the people's side cannot but be military self-defense. In the self-defense struggle, the People's Liberation Army has achieved extraordinarily great victories in the past period. In the half-year since the U.S. and Chiang launched a full-scale civil war, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have been annihilated in divisions and brigades, while the People's Liberation Army has never had a single battalion annihilated. Such battles are rare or even non-existent in Chinese and foreign history. In half a year, one-fifth of Chiang Kai-shek's forces attacking the liberated areas have been annihilated. There is no basis to say that the People's Liberation Army cannot win in the patriotic self-defense war, and there is no basis to say that the future of the Chinese people's struggle is not bright; on the contrary, we have full basis to say that the Chinese people's struggle for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland is bound to be victorious, and the bright period is coming soon!
    Over the past year or so, the international situation has changed. This change, in general, is that on the one hand, the American imperialist clique has replaced the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists and become the world's aggressor. The American imperialists and their running dogs in various countries, as well as the remnants of fascist forces, have become the common enemies of mankind. On the other hand, there is the success of the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, the victory of its peaceful and democratic foreign policy, and the progress of the people in capitalist countries. This progress of the world's people, whether in terms of its scale or its speed, far exceeds the situation after World War I, manifested in the establishment of new democratic regimes in Eastern and Southeastern European countries, the progress of Britain and France, the struggle of colonial and semi-colonial nations, led by China, for independence and freedom, the leftward shift of the peoples of Germany, Japan, and Italy, the strike movements and democratic movements in the United States, and the democratic movements in Central and South American countries. The main contradiction in the world is the contradiction between democracy and anti-democracy, that is, the contradiction between the American imperialists and the American people, the contradiction between the American imperialists and their running dogs and the broad masses of the people in capitalist countries, and the contradiction between the American imperialists and their running dogs and the nations in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The American people, the people of capitalist countries other than the United States, and the nations of colonial and semi-colonial countries will inevitably form a united front on a world scale to oppose the American imperialists and their running dogs in various countries. And this democratic world united front will surely receive the sympathy and support of the socialist Soviet Union. Throughout the world, the American imperialists and their running dogs in various countries are becoming increasingly isolated internationally and domestically. The economic crisis in the United States will arrive this year and next year. This crisis will surely deepen the contradiction between democracy and anti-democracy, promote the formation and expansion of a democratic united front on a world scale, and accelerate the scale and process of the progress and unity of the world's people. Because after the next economic crisis, the United States will no longer be able to have economic prosperity, the American imperialists will no longer be able to be so arrogant and menacing for so long. The socialist Soviet Union will continue its economic construction and peaceful and democratic foreign policy, and the progress and unity of the people of all countries will continue to develop on a huge scale and at a fast speed. Therefore, although the broad victory of the people still requires a long struggle, it will not be a very long time.
    Such a domestic situation and such an international situation determine that a new upsurge of the Chinese people's independent, peaceful, and democratic movement must arrive, and the time for it will not be long. This upsurge will be national in scope, and when it arrives, no one will be able to stop it. Participating in this movement will be an extremely broad range of people from all walks of life, with the exception of a very small number of reactionaries. The backbone of this movement is the 140 million most conscious soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas. Therefore, full preparations must be made ideologically and among the masses to welcome the arrival of this upsurge.
    On the other hand, such a domestic situation and international situation also determine that the Chinese people's independent, peaceful, and democratic movement will also have a difficult period. This difficulty will mainly be manifested in the transformation of some areas into guerrilla zones under the attack of the Chiang troops, and the financial and economic difficulties in many areas due to military supplies. We must also be ideologically prepared for this kind of difficulty, work out ways to overcome it, and mobilize everyone to unite and overcome it in order to welcome the arrival of the light!
    Our task is extremely glorious, and our goal of struggle is the liberation of the Chinese nation and the independence and freedom of the motherland. For this goal, we resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism, demand the abolition of the "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" and other treaties that betray the country, demand that the United States stop interfering in China's internal affairs, demand the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China, demand that the U.S. government stop assisting the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, demand that American troops be prohibited from committing atrocities in China, demand that war criminals such as Okamura Neiji and traitors be severely punished, and also demand that the running dogs of American imperialism who betray the motherland be severely punished. Our goal is domestic peace in China. For this goal, we insist on implementing the truce agreement of January 10th of last year, insist on restoring the military positions of January 13th of last year, resolutely oppose American imperialists helping Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war, and mobilize all soldiers and civilians to resolutely smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Our goal of struggle is democracy in China. For this goal, we insist on the Political Consultative Conference line, resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's illegal "National Assembly" and its puppet constitution, resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's secret service terror and oppression of democratic people, resolutely implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocated "land to the tillers", and resolutely implement the three-thirds system of government and the new democratic policies in all aspects of politics, economy, military affairs, and culture in the liberated areas. Regarding the political propositions for the whole country, Comrade Mao Zedong has said in detail in the chapter "The Policies of the Chinese Communist Party" in "On Coalition Government". We now solemnly reiterate that the basic propositions that Comrade Mao Zedong said in this book are still the basic propositions of our party. Comrade Mao Zedong said:
    "Under the major premise of completely eliminating the Japanese aggressors and building a new China, at the present stage in China, we Communists are consistent with the broadest component of the Chinese population on such a basic point, that is: First, China is neither a feudal and fascist anti-people state system ruled by big landlords and big bourgeoisie, because this anti-people system has been completely bankrupt by the Kuomintang's main ruling group in its 18 years of rule. Second, China cannot and therefore should not attempt to establish a purely free bourgeois old-style democratic dictatorship, because in China, on the one hand, the free bourgeoisie is still very weak economically and politically; on the other hand, China has long produced a Chinese proletariat and its leader - the Chinese Communist Party, which is aware of its powerful ability on the Chinese political stage and has led the broad peasant class, petty bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and other democratic elements. Third, at the present stage in China, the task of the Chinese people is still to oppose national oppression and feudal oppression, and when the necessary conditions for social and economic development in China are not yet met, the Chinese people cannot and therefore should not attempt to realize a socialist state system."
    "So, what is our proposition? We propose that after completely eliminating the Japanese aggressors, we establish a democratic alliance state system of a united front based on the vast majority of the people of the whole country. We call such a state system a new democratic state system."
    "This is a state system that truly meets the requirements of the broadest component of the Chinese population. Because, first, it has obtained and may obtain the consent of millions of industrial workers and tens of millions of manual workers and hired peasants; second, it has also obtained and may obtain the consent of 80% of the Chinese population, that is, 360 million out of 450 million people of the peasant class; and third, it has also obtained and may obtain the sympathy of the broad petty bourgeoisie, the free bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, and other patriotic elements."
    In the struggle against the American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek clique, in the struggle for China's independence, peace, and democracy, all of our 2.2 million Communist Party members must abide by these words shown to us by Chairman Mao, cooperate with the broad workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, free bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, and other patriotic elements, and cooperate with the people of all capitalist countries, and cooperate with the nations of colonial and semi-colonial countries to realize a new democratic New China, and continue to cooperate in the long term to build New China in the future.
    The year 1947, that is, the 36th year of the Republic of China, will undoubtedly be a year in which the bright days for the Chinese nation and the Chinese people are getting closer and closer. Our difficulties are the difficulties in victory, the difficulties in the birth of a new China, and therefore are difficulties that can be overcome. In some areas that have become guerrilla zones, we should persist in guerrilla warfare in order to recover lost territories in the future. Regarding economic difficulties, we need to organize production, promote frugality, and make careful calculations to overcome them. The difficulties we encounter are fundamentally different in nature from the difficulties encountered by the reactionaries. The difficulties encountered by the reactionaries are the difficulties in decline, the difficulties in death, and are difficulties that are absolutely impossible to overcome.
    All of our Communist Party members must be with the people of the whole country, overcome difficulties and welcome the light in this year. Our hard struggle will be exchanged for the realization of a new China. Our confidence in victory has never been so high as it is now, and our victory is bound to come!

　　艰苦奋斗迎接光明
    解放日报新年献辞
    自从前年八月日寇投降以来，经过了一年多的摸索和试验，我国国内的情况，我国人民奋斗的道路、奋斗的方法、奋斗的前途，都已经清楚了。抗战胜利之后，代替日本帝国主义的，来了个美国的帝国主义者要想灭亡中国，变中国为美国帝国主义的殖民地；代替日本法西斯的傀儡汪逆精卫的，来了个美国帝国主义的走狗蒋介石坚决执行卖国内战独裁的政策，把中国出卖给美国的帝国主义者，取得美国帝国主义者的帮助来进行空前巨大的内战，以维持其法西斯的独裁统治，企图使全国人民成为蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族的奴隶。中国人民因此要为祖国的独立和平民主与美蒋两个民族敌人誓死斗争。这种斗争由于美蒋所用的主要手段是内战，因之在人民方面斗争的主要方式，不能不是军事的自卫斗争。在自卫斗争中，过去时期人民解放军得到了异常伟大的胜利。在美蒋发动全国内战半年以来，蒋介石的军队整师整旅的被歼灭，而人民解放军则从未有一次有一个营被其歼灭者。像这样的战斗，中外历史上是少有的，甚至是没有的。半年之中，蒋介石进攻解放区的兵力已有五分之一被歼。没有根据可以说人民解放军在爱国自卫战中不能胜利，没有根据可以说中国人民奋斗的前途不是光明的；恰恰相反，我们有充分的根据来说中国人民为了祖国独立和平民主的奋斗，是一定胜利的，而且光明时期快要到来了！
    一年多以来，国际情况已起了变化，这种变化总起来说，就是：一方面美国的帝国主义分子集团代替了德意日法西斯而成为世界的侵略者，美国的帝国主义者及其在各国的走狗和法西斯的残余势力，成为世界人类的公敌；另一方面，则是苏联的社会主义建设的成功，和平民主的外交政策的胜利，与资本主义各国人民的进步。这种世界人民的进步，不论就其规模来说，或就其速度来说，都远远的超过了第一次世界大战以后的情况，表现于东欧东南欧各国新民主主义政权的成立，英法两国的进步，以中国为首的殖民地、半殖民地民族争取独立自由的斗争，德日意三国人民的左倾，美国的罢工运动与民主运动，中美、南美各国的民主运动。世界的主要矛盾，乃是民主与反民主的矛盾，即是美国的帝国主义者与美国人民的矛盾，美国的帝国主义者及其走狗与资本主义各国广大人民的矛盾，美国的帝国主义者及其走狗与殖民地、半殖民地各民族的矛盾。美国人民、美国以外的各资本主义国家及殖民地、半殖民地各民族，势必结成世界规模的统一战线，来反对美国的帝国主义者及其在各国的走狗。而这个民主的世界统一战线，一定会得到社会主义苏联的同情和声援。在全世界上，美国的帝国主义者及其在各国的走狗，在国际上是日趋孤立，在各国国内也是日趋孤立。美国的经济危机在今年和明年就要到来，这个危机一定要加深世界民主与反民主的矛盾，促成世界规模的民主统一战线的形成、扩大和加速世界人民进步团结的规模和过程。由于美国在下次经济危机之后，将再不能有经济的繁荣，因而美国的帝国主义者就再不能神气活现和张牙舞爪到怎样长久，而社会主义苏联将继续其经济建设与和平民主的外交政策，世界各国人民的进步团结将继续以巨大的规模和很快的速度发展下去。所以，人民的广泛的胜利虽然还须经过长期的奋斗，但是这不会是很长的时间了。
    这样的国内形势和这样的国际形势，就决定了中国人民的新的独立和平民主运动的高潮一定要到来，而且其时间不会要很久。这个运动的高潮将是全国性的，当其到来的时候，将是谁也阻挡不住的。参加这个运动的，将是极其广大的各阶层人民，只有极少数的反动派除外。作为这个运动的中坚力量的是解放区一万万四千万最有觉悟的军民，因此必须在思想上、在群众中有充分的准备来迎接这一个高潮的到来。
    另外一方面，这样的国内形势与国际形势，也决定了中国人民的独立和平民主运动还有一个困难时期，这种困难主要的将表现于在蒋军进攻中若干地区的变为游击区，以及许多地区因军事的供应而发生的财政经济的困难。必须对于这种困难也有思想上的准备，定出克服的办法，动员大家团结一致的来把它克服，以迎接光明的到来！
    我们的任务是非常光荣的，我们奋斗的目标是中华民族的解放祖国的独立自由。为了这个目标，我们坚决反对美国帝国主义的侵略，要求废除“中美友好通商航海条约”与其他亡国条约，要求美国停止干涉中国内政，要求撤退美国在华驻军，要求美国政府停止对蒋介石独裁政府的援助，要求禁止美国军队的在华暴行，要求严惩冈村宁次等战犯及汉奸，并且要求严惩美国帝国主义走狗出卖祖国的卖国贼。我们的目标是中国的国内和平，为了这个目标，我们坚持实现去年一月十日的停战协定，坚持恢复去年一月十三日的军事位置，坚决反对美帝国主义者帮助蒋介石打内战，并且要动员全体军民坚决粉碎蒋介石的进攻。我们奋斗的目标是中国的民主，为了这个目标，我们坚持政治协商会议路线，坚决反对蒋介石的非法“国大”及其伪宪，坚决反对蒋介石的特务恐怖与对民主人民的压迫，坚决实行孙中山先生所提倡的耕者有其田，并在解放区中坚决实施三三制的政权及政治、经济、军事、文化各方面的新民主主义的政策。我们对于全国的政治主张，毛泽东同志已经在“论联合政府”的“中国共产党的政策”一章中说得很详细，我们现在郑重的重申毛泽东同志在这本书中所说的基本主张仍是我党的基本主张。毛泽东同志说：
    “在彻底消灭日本侵略者与建设新中国的大前提之下，在中国现阶段上，我们共产党人在这样一个基本点上，是和中国人口中最广大的成份相一致的，这就是：第一、中国既不是一个由大地主大资产阶级专政的封建的法西斯的反人民的国家制度，因为这种反人民的制度，已由国民党主要统治集团在其十八年的统治中表现出完全破产了。第二、中国也不可能、因此就不应该企图建立一个纯粹自由资产阶级旧式民主主义专政的国家，因为在中国，一方面自由资产阶级在经济上、政治上至今还表现得很软弱；另一方面，中国早已产生了一个觉悟了在中国政治舞台上表现了强大能力的、领导了广大的农民阶级、小资产阶级、知识分子及其他民主分子的中国无产阶级及其领袖——中国共产党这样新的条件。第三、在中国的现阶段上，在中国人民的任务还是反对民族压迫与封建压迫，在中国社会经济的必要条件还不具备时，中国人民也不可能、因此就不应该企图实现社会主义的国家制度。”
    “那末，我们的主张是什么呢？我们主张在彻底消灭日本侵略者之后，建立一个以全国绝大多数人民为基础的统一战线的民主联盟的国家制度，我们把这样的国家制度称之为新民主主义的国家制度。”
    “这是一个真正适合中国人口中最广大成份的要求的国家制度。因为第一、它取得了与可能取得数百万产业工人，数千万手工工人与雇佣农民的同意；其次，也取得了与可能取得占中国人口百分之八十、即在四万万五千万人口中，占了三万万六千万的农民阶级的同意；又其次，也取得了与可能取得广大的小资产阶级、自由资产阶级、开明绅士及其他爱国分子的同情。”
    在反对美国的帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石集团的斗争中，在为中国独立和平民主的奋斗中，我们全体二百二十万共产党员一定遵守毛主席所昭示我们的这些话，与广大的工人、农民、小资产阶级、自由资产阶级、开明绅士与其他爱国分子合作，并与世界各资本主义国家人民合作，与殖民地半殖民地的各民族合作来实现新民主主义的新中国，并且在以后继续长期合作建设新中国。
    一九四七年即民国三十六年，毫无疑义的将是中华民族与中国人民光明的日子益临近的年份，我们的困难乃是胜利中的困难，乃是新中国诞生中的困难，因而是可以克服的困难。在有些变成游击区的地区，应该坚持游击战争，以便将来收复失地。对于经济的困难，要求组织生产，提倡节约和精密的计算来加以克服。我们所遇到的困难与反动派所遇到的困难，其性质截然不同，反动派所遇到的困难乃是没落中的困难，死亡中的困难，是绝对无法克服的困难。
    我们全体共产党员要与全国人民在一起，在今年一年中克服困难迎接光明，我们坚苦奋斗将要换得新中国的实现。我们的胜利信心从来没有现在这样高，我们的胜利是一定要来到了！
