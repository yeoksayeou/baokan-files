　　One Jin of Saltpeter Earns Eight Jin of Rice; 60,000 Jin of Saltpeter Produced in Fifty Days
  　Lucheng Workers Summarize Experiences and Improve Technology
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch of the 11th] The Lucheng County Government and County Trade Union convened a county-wide saltpeter boiling workers' meeting in mid-December. Fifty-seven skilled workers attended to summarize the 50-day saltpeter boiling work, discussing how to save raw materials, reduce costs, improve quality, improve technology, produce more saltpeter to support the patriotic self-defense front, and earn more money to get rich. First, they held a forum to exchange experiences, summarizing three points: 1. Use the method of transmitting technology and training apprentices to promote saltpeter boiling technology. 2. Use a bonus dividend system to implement labor-capital cooperation in management methods to increase workers' production enthusiasm. 3. Improve relations with the masses to ensure a continuous supply of raw materials, such as ash and charcoal. The county produced a total of 57,630 jin of saltpeter in 50 days, with an income of 15.71 million yuan. After deducting raw material expenses, each jin of saltpeter earned an average of eight jin of rice, totaling over 460,000 jin of rice. Workers earned wages of over 168,000 jin of rice, and the masses earned 4.74 million yuan by accumulating ash and transporting ash and charcoal. Finally, it was decided to strengthen the leadership of saltpeter boiling in the future. The workers formally established a Saltpeter Workers' Committee, electing Xu Youwen and Gao Changsheng as the director and deputy director, respectively, to be responsible for leading the saltpeter boiling work in the future.
