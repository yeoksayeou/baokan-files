    Captured 700 Including the Battalion Commander
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th] In the anti-nibbling struggle in the Jilin area, the Democratic Allied Forces annihilated two enemy battalions. The enemy 113th Regiment of the 38th Division of the New First Army, entrenched on the west bank of the Songhua River in Qitamu (60 li north of Wulajie), has been constantly nibbling at the Liberated Areas. The Democratic Allied Forces launched a counterattack on the 6th. Two battalions (minus one company) of Chiang's army stationed in Jiutai, along with a tank detachment, rushed to reinforce them. At 3:00 PM on the 7th, they came into contact with our forces in Zhangmazigou. After three hours of fierce fighting, our army completely annihilated the reinforcing enemy. Preliminary statistics: Wang Dongli, regimental commander of the 113th Regiment, was killed; over 200 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded; two enemy battalion commanders and 730 officers and soldiers below the deputy detachment leader were captured. The following were seized: 62 light and heavy machine guns, 510 rifles, 26 artillery pieces of various types, 105 American-style submachine guns, and 15 vehicles of all sizes (including 3 disguised armored vehicles). The battle is continuing.
