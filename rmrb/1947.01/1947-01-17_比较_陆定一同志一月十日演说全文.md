Comparison
-- Full text of Comrade Lu Dingyi's Speech on January 10th --

Today, we commemorate the first anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference and the Ceasefire Order, and support the patriotic movement that erupted among students across the country due to the rape of a Peking University female student by U.S. troops in Beiping. This meeting is very meaningful, indicating that we in Yan'an, all sectors of society, and the people of our liberated areas have a firm and unwavering will to strive for the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference's line, the restoration of the military positions of last January's Ceasefire Order, and for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, the cessation of U.S. interference in China's internal affairs, the cessation of U.S. aid to the Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, and the abolition of the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty and other new unequal treaties.

Are there any "radical" elements in our proposals? Not at all. The January Ceasefire Order was issued by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, and jointly signed by representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as Marshall. If issuing an order and signing an agreement, and then abiding by the agreement, is called "radical," while issuing an order and signing an agreement, but not abiding by it, and instead acting against it, is called "fair," then the virtue of trustworthiness should be completely erased from the list of human virtues. The same is true for the Political Consultative Conference line. Without the restoration of the military positions of the January Ceasefire Order, while simultaneously engaging in an unprecedented civil war, yet convening a "National Assembly" monopolized by one party, and passing a so-called "Constitution," if it could be said that this "Constitution" "conforms to the principles of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions" and is a "democratic constitution," then an owl's egg could hatch a peacock, and the distinctions between right and wrong, good and evil, beauty and ugliness could be discarded from human conscience!

Regarding the relationship between the Chinese people and the U.S. government, things are also very clear. When General Stilwell was in China, faithfully implementing Roosevelt's policies, he was hated by the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique but sympathized with by the Chinese people. When General Hurley was in China, he openly aided the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Chinese people appropriately gave him the title of imperialist. These are all very fair and without any "radical" elements.

When General Marshall came to China, on December 20th of the year before last, Shanghai students braved beatings by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to hold a parade to welcome him, because the Chinese people knew that General Marshall had made glorious contributions in the anti-fascist war. However, exactly one year after that welcome parade was held, 300,000 students in eleven major cities in Chiang Kai-shek's controlled areas of China held another parade, shouting "U.S. troops get out of China!" "U.S. troops don't leave, the civil war won't stop!" "Demand that the U.S. government change its China policy!" "Oppose servile diplomacy!"

In his statement upon leaving China on the 7th, General Marshall said that he believed there were two factions within the Chinese Communist Party, one called the radical faction and the other called the liberal faction. According to this, the 300,000 protesting young students are not Communist Party members and should be even more liberal. However, how great and how rapid has their understanding of the U.S. government changed in the past year!

Who caused such a huge change in the Chinese people's understanding of the U.S. government?

During Hurley's time, the U.S. equipped Chiang Kai-shek with twenty divisions; during Marshall's time, the U.S. equipped Chiang Kai-shek with twenty-five divisions, five more divisions than in the previous period. During Hurley's time, the U.S. helped Chiang Kai-shek transport five armies; during Marshall's time, they transported nine more armies, four more armies than in the previous period. During Hurley's time, there was no ceasefire agreement stipulating that troops were not allowed to be moved, and Chiang Kai-shek mobilized 110 divisions to attack the liberated areas; during Marshall's time, a ceasefire agreement prohibiting the movement of troops was signed, resulting in a short-term truce of three months, followed by an even greater civil war. Chiang Kai-shek attacked the liberated areas with 218 divisions (some now renamed brigades), doubling the military strength compared to the previous period, and Chiang Kai-shek's troop movements in violation of the ceasefire agreement accounted for 90 percent of his total military strength. During Hurley's time, the U.S. government gave Chiang Kai-shek small loans; during Marshall's time, the U.S. Army and Navy gave Chiang Kai-shek "surplus materials" worth over 800 million U.S. dollars, and the U.S. government also "presented" Chiang Kai-shek with a navy. During Hurley's time, Chiang Kai-shek used the Japanese army to attack the liberated areas; during Marshall's time, Chiang Kai-shek further used the number one war criminal, Okamura Neiji, as an advisor to attack the liberated areas. In addition, there is this news: First, negotiations are underway for the U.S. to transfer its lend-lease materials in India to Chiang Kai-shek; Second, a loan of 500 million U.S. dollars will be given to the Chiang Kai-shek government under the pretext that the Chiang clique's "National Assembly" has passed the "democratic constitution" and "reorganized government." It is these gold coins, weapons, materials, and various kinds of aid that have been given to the head of the reactionaries, Chiang Kai-shek, to the Chiang Kai-shek whom Marshall calls "can achieve the goal of unity through a good government" under his "leadership," to this Chinese people's executioner and murderer, so Chiang Kai-shek dares to launch such an unprecedented large-scale civil war, so millions of Chinese people die under American-made weapons; so "in January, the Communist Party had no uncompromising attitude," but in December and this January, 300,000 students held such demonstrations. Isn't this very clear? General Marshall, please ask yourself in the dead of night, which of my words "disregards the truth and the course of events?" Which of my words "exhausts the ability of deliberate distortion and slander?" Which of my words "deceives the Chinese and world people?" If the "written propaganda of the CCP" has been "difficult for American officials to tolerate" and has a "criminal nature," then who can tolerate the American warlords' airplanes and cannons assisting the Chinese reactionaries in wantonly slaughtering the Chinese people, and what is its nature?! Who can tolerate the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce and Navigation that will lead to the destruction of our country and race, and what is its nature?! Marshall, who personally signed the ceasefire order, not only disregards his due credibility as a mediator and signatory when faced with the CCP's fair demands for the dissolution of the National Assembly and the restoration of the military positions of January 13th last year, but also says that the CCP is unwilling to compromise fairly, and praises Chiang Kai-shek's National Assembly's constitution as a "democratic constitution," and praises the murderer Chiang Kai-shek as capable of leading a "good government." Who can tolerate this? What is its nature? Is Marshall speaking for the interests of the Chiang, Kung, Soong, and Chen families, or is he truly speaking for the Chinese people? What "national interest" is Marshall talking about, is it the interest of Chinese independence, or the interest that American imperialist aggressors hope to obtain, namely the colonization of China?

Marshall uses the Anping Incident as an example of the "criminal nature" of the CCP's written propaganda, but our written propaganda's exposure of American imperialist behavior is not even as good as that of the Shanghai-based Millard's Review, run by Americans. For example, there have been more than 30 incidents of U.S. troops attacking liberated areas, but we have only published a few of them. In the past fifteen months, there have been more than 3,800 cases of U.S. military atrocities in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, resulting in more than 3,300 Chinese casualties, and we have published even less about this.

Even taking the Anping Incident itself, Anping was also a liberated area before January 13th last year. After the incident, the area was occupied by the joint Chiang-American forces, coordinated by the U.S. Air Force and tanks, and it is still occupied to this day. Are the Eighth Route Army soldiers crazy, enjoying the occupation of Anping town, and therefore organizing "planned ambush attacks?" What kind of logic is this? The logic of ordinary people can only lead to another conclusion, namely that the U.S. military and Chiang's army planned to jointly occupy Anping, which is very clear. However, for the sake of friendship, we have never published such a fair conclusion before Marshall's statement.

I am the Propaganda Minister of the CCP Central Committee, and I am fully responsible for the CCP's written propaganda. The CCP's written propaganda is different from the deceptive propaganda of any Chinese or foreign reactionary faction. It is completely consistent with the facts, and therefore its influence is particularly great. Therefore, both the American people and the Chinese people highly trust the CCP's written propaganda. Marshall's full-fledged and rude opposition to our cause is surprising, coming from the mouth of a mediator. However, this is not surprising. It can only prove how powerful my cause is, so that those who want to hide the facts and those who want to betray their credibility cannot but hate my work and the work of my comrades, and try their best to prevent the American people from hearing the truth by crude slander.

In his statement upon leaving China, following his February 25th rebuke of the Kuomintang "diehards," Marshall once again rebuked the reactionaries within the Kuomintang. There is nothing new in what he rebuked. When people recall that the last time Marshall rebuked the Kuomintang diehards, the U.S. side followed up by vigorously assisting Chiang Kai-shek, resulting in a large-scale civil war, the Chinese people will have to look at the facts in the future to judge Marshall's intention in rebuking the reactionaries within the Kuomintang this time. We Chinese people do not want Marshall to use the words of rebuking the Kuomintang reactionaries as an excuse for his actual actions of supporting the head of the reactionaries, Chiang Kai-shek, "and thus actually supporting the entire reactionary faction." We hope Marshall will not do this.

As for the restoration of the military positions of January 13th, the restoration of the Political Consultative Conference line, and the glorious independence of the Chinese nation, the Chinese people are deeply convinced that they have the strength to achieve these goals. General Marshall will have the opportunity to personally see the realization of these just goals of the Chinese people. Our meeting today demonstrates this firm and unwavering will!

    ——陆定一同志一月十日演说全文——
    今天我们纪念政治协商会议和停战令的一周年，及声援全国各地同学由于北平美军强奸北大女生而爆发的爱国运动。这个大会很有意义，表示我们延安各界、我们解放区人民是有坚强不移的意志，要为实现政治协商会议的路线、实现去年一月停战令的军事位置，和为美军撤出中国、美军停止干涉中国内政、美国停止援蒋内战和废除中美商约与其他新的不平等条约而奋斗。
    我们的这些主张，有“激烈”的地方么？一点也没有。一月停战令是蒋介石、毛泽东下的，是国共两方代表与马歇尔共同签字的。如果下了令签了字而又遵守协议叫作“激烈”，下了令签了字又不遵守协议倒反叫做“公允”，那末就应当从人类的美德之中把信义一项一笔勾销。政治协商会议路线也是如此，没有一月停战令军事位置的恢复，一面进行着历史上规模空前的内战，一面却召开一党包办的什么“国民大会”，通过什么“宪法”，如果这样反倒可以说这个“宪法”“符合政治协商会议决议的原则”，是一部“民主宪法”，那末猫头鹰的蛋就可以孵出孔雀，是非善恶美丑的区别，尽可以从人类的良知中抛弃！
    在中国人民与美国政府的关系上，事情也很明白。当史迪威将军在中国的时候，忠实执行罗斯福政策，他就被反动派蒋介石集团所痛恨，而被中国人民所同情。当赫尔利将军在中国的时候，他公开援助反动派蒋介石集团，中国人民就适当的送了他一个头衔，叫做帝国主义者。这些都是非常公允，而毫无“激烈”之处。
    马歇尔将军到中国来，前年十二月二十日，上海学生曾冒着蒋介石特务的殴打举行了欢迎他的游行，因为中国人民知道马歇尔将军曾在反法西斯战争中有过光荣的贡献。但是，恰恰在这欢迎的游行举行过了一整年的时候，中国蒋介石统治区十一个大城市的三十万学生，举行了另一个游行，高呼“美军滚出中国去”，“美军不滚内战不停”，“要求美国政府改变对华政策”，“反对奴才外交”！
    马歇尔将军七日发表的离华声明中说，他相信中国共产党里有两派，一派叫做激烈分子，另一派叫自由主义分子。照此说来，三十万示威的青年学生既不是共产党员，应该更加是自由主义分子。然而，他们对于美国政府的认识，一年以来变化何等的大，又何等的快呀！
    谁叫中国人民对美国政府的认识发生如此巨大的变化？
    赫尔利时期，美国装备了蒋介石二十个师；马歇尔时期，美国又装备了蒋介石廿五个师，比前一时期还多五个师。赫尔利时期，美军帮助蒋介石运了五个军；马歇尔时期又加运了九个军，比前一时期还多运四个军。赫尔利时期还没有订立规定军队不许调动的停战协定，蒋介石动员了一百一十个师进攻解放区；马歇尔时期订了不准移动军队的停战协议，有三个月的短期休战，然后发生更大的内战，蒋介石以二百十八个师（有些现改称旅）进攻解放区，兵力比过去一时期多一倍，而且蒋介石违反停战协定而调动的兵力，占其总兵力百分之九十。赫尔利时期，美国政府给蒋介石以小的借款；马歇尔时期，美国陆海军给蒋介石以价值八万万美金以上的“剩余物资”，美国政府并“赠送”蒋介石一支海军。赫尔利时期，蒋介石利用日军进攻解放区；马歇尔时期，蒋介石进一步用第一号战犯冈村宁次做进攻解放区的顾问。此外，还有这样的消息：第一、美国将其在印度的租借物资转给蒋介石的谈判正在进行；第二、五万万美金的借款，将在蒋记“国大”已通过“民主宪法”与“改组政府”的借口之下交给蒋介石政府。就是这些金元武器物资和各种援助给了反动派的头子蒋介石，给了马歇尔所谓在其“领导之下”“必可经由良好政府而达到团结之目标”的蒋介石，给了这个中国人民的刽子手杀人犯，所以蒋介石敢于发动这样规模空前的大内战，所以几百万中国人民死在美国制造的武器之下；所以“在一月间共产党并无不妥协的表示”，而十二月与今年一月间三十万学生却举行这样的示威，这不是很明白么？马歇尔将军请在深夜里扪心自问，我这里说的话，那一句“不顾真理及事实之经过”？那一句“极尽故意曲解及诋毁之能事”？那一句“欺骗中国及世界人民”？如果“中共的文字宣传”已为美国官员“绝难容忍”，已有“罪恶性质”；那末，美国军阀的飞机大炮援助中国反动派放肆的屠杀中国人民，中国人民谁能容忍，而且属于什么性质呢！？亡国灭种的中美通商航海条约中国人民谁能容忍，而且属于什么性质呢！？亲自在停战令上签字的马歇尔，对于中共方面提出的解散国民大会，恢复去年一月十三日军队位置的公允要求，不但不顾到自己当调人和签字人的应有的信义不加理睬，反而说中共不愿有公允之妥协，反而称赞蒋记国大的宪法为“民主宪法”，称赞杀人犯蒋介石可以领导“良好政府”，这又谁能容忍呢？这又属于什么性质呢？马歇尔究竟在为蒋孔宋陈四大家族利益说话呢？还是真正为中国人民说话呢？马歇尔所说的“国家利益”，究竟是中国独立的利益呢？还是美国帝国主义侵略者所希望得到的利益，即中国的殖民地化呢？
    马歇尔以安平事件为中共文字宣传的“罪恶性质”的例证，但是我们的文字宣传对于美国帝国主义行为的暴露，甚至还不及美国人办的上海密勒氏评论报。举例来说，美军进攻解放区的事件，前后已有三十余次，我们仅仅发表了很少几次。美军暴行，十五个月来在京沪平津青五地已达三千八百余起，死伤华人三千三百人以上，而我们发表得更加不够。
    即以安平事件本身来说，安平也是去年一月十三日以前的解放区，事件发生后，该地即被由美国空军和坦克配合的蒋美联军所占领，直到现在仍然被占领着。难道八路军是疯子，喜欢安平镇被占领，因而组织“有计划的埋伏袭击”么？这是什么逻辑呢？常人的逻辑只能得出另一结论，即是美军与蒋军有计划的联合占领安平、这是很明白的。可是，这样的公允的结论，在马歇尔此次声明以前，我们为了友谊起见，始终没有发表。
    我是中共中央的宣传部长，对于中共的文字宣传完全负责，中共的文字宣传与任何中外反动派的欺骗宣传不同，是完全合乎事实的，因此其影响特别巨大，因而不论美国人民和中国人民，都十分信赖中共的文字宣传。马歇尔此次以全副力量和粗暴的态度来反对我们的事业，这种粗暴的态度出诸一个调解人的口里，不能不令人惊讶。但是，这并没有什么奇怪，这只能证明我的事业是何等有力量，以致要想隐瞒事实的人，要想背弃信义的人不能不痛恨我和同志们的工作，竭力以粗暴的污蔑，想使美国人民不听真理的报导。
    马歇尔在其离华声明中，在其去年二月二十五日斥责国民党“顽固分子”之后，再度斥责国民党内反动派。他所斥责的，并无新奇之点，当人民回忆到上一次马歇尔斥责了国民党顽固分子之后，美方跟着竭力援助蒋介石，以致大打内战的事实，中国人民对于马歇尔此次斥责国民党内反动派的用意，是还要看看今后的事实才能作出判断。我们中国人民不希望马歇尔以斥责国民党反动派的言词来作为他支持反动派头子蒋介石，“因而实际上支持整个反动派”的实际行动的饶恕，我们希望马歇尔会不这样做。
    至于一月十三日军事位置的恢复，政协路线的恢复，中华民族光荣的独立，中国人民深信自己有力量来达到这些目的。中国人民这些正义的目的的实现，马歇尔将军是会有机会亲自看到的。我们今天的大会就表示了这种坚定不移的意志！
