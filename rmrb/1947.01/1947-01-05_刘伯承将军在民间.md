　　General Liu Bocheng Among the People
    Cai Gongdi
  (IV) General Liu in the Hearts of Elementary School Students
    I went to an elementary school in Xiaozhang Village and saw several elementary school students writing the five characters "General Liu Bocheng." They were writing them in a very proper regular script. I thought to myself: Why can first-grade elementary school students write so neatly? I took this question to Teacher Xu, who replied, "Ever since our village heard about the successive great victories, many students have automatically asked me how to write the five characters 'General Liu Bocheng.' I specifically taught two literacy classes, and now they can all write them. Not only can the elementary school students write them, but the militiamen and women, all dozens of households in the village, can write them."
    While Teacher Xu was talking to me, he took out several portraits and said, "This is a portrait of General Liu Bocheng. It is not well drawn, but it comes from the sincere love of the elementary school students. In terms of technique, it is certainly not as good as a painter's, but because it is a portrait drawn by the innocent love of the elementary school students, it is indeed a precious work.
    Teacher Xu enthusiastically interrupted my interjection and continued to talk about the materials he had not finished; "Our school recently held a lecture meeting, and two students spoke very satisfactorily to me.
    "One student named Li Guang said: 'The liberated area is like a pile of rice, and the Chiang army is like a rat stealing rice. General Liu put the rice in a rat trap, and the rats, not knowing whether they are dead or alive, still come in to eat it, and as a result, they are caught in General Liu's rat trap. Now tens of thousands of Chiang rats have been caught...'
    "Another student named Xu Defu said: 'The liberated area is like a big vat of oil, and the Chiang army is also like rats stealing oil. General Liu's tactic is to cover the oil vat. Once the oil vat is covered, the Chiang rats panic and fall into the oil vat. Zhao Yangtian is the big rat that fell into the oil vat...'
    After listening, I felt that General Liu had personally cultivated a new generation, and this new generation is singing the praises of their great benefactor.
  (V) The Masses Vie to Purchase Portraits of General Liu
    After the five great victories, especially the great victory in Huaxian County, the residents of Wu'an City were all beaming and saying, "It's good to enjoy the shade under a big tree, we rely on the commander to have a good time..." Because everyone missed their benefactor, they all scrambled to buy large hanging portraits of General Liu. According to Chen Baoxian, a clerk at a bookstore, "In the past two days alone, more than two hundred large hanging portraits of General Liu have been sold. Some people have also asked me if there are any General Liu badges that can be worn on the body?" I replied, "No!" They said, "Why don't you make them? When can they be made? You must put up advertisements when you make them!" I honestly told him, "There are difficulties now, we can't make them." These words were like cold water poured on the questioner, making them very unhappy and saying: "You always say you are serving the people, don't you even help us to hang up the portraits of the ever-victorious general, which is what we want?" After hearing this, I didn't answer; I just thought about what they had just said, the words contained a very deep and long taste. (To be continued)

　　刘伯承将军在民间
    蔡公狄
  （四）小学生心中的刘师长
    我到了小张庄的一所小学里，看见几个小学生，在那里写“刘伯承将军”五个字，正楷写得满像个样子，我想了一想：一年级的小学生，为什么能学写得这样端正呢？我带着这疑问去问了那许老师，他答道：“自从我庄子上听到一次二次大捷后，许多学生都自动的问起我，那“刘伯承将军”五个字怎样写。我专意上了两堂识字课，现在都会写了。不仅那些小学生会写；还有民兵妇女们，全庄几十户都会写了。”
    许老师一边与我说，一边拿出了几张画像，他说：“这是刘伯承将军的像，画得不好，但出自小学生们真切敬爱的手笔。如果论技术，那当然没有画家画得好，但由于它是小学生们天真无邪的热爱所画出的像，的确是可珍贵的作品。
    许老师很热情的打断了我的插话，仍继续说他没有说完的材料；“我校最近曾开了一个讲演会，有两个学生讲得很令我满意。
    “一位叫李广的说：‘解放区像一堆米，蒋军像偷米吃的老鼠，刘师长把那米放到老鼠笼里，那不知死活的老鼠，还一样的进来吃，结果被装到刘师长那老鼠笼里去了，现在已装到好几万蒋老鼠了，……’
    “另一位叫许得福的说：‘解放区像一大缸油，蒋军也像老鼠一样偷油吃，刘师长的战法是盖油缸的战法，把油缸一盖，那蒋老鼠一着慌就掉到油缸里去了，赵扬田就是掉到油缸里的大老鼠……’
    我听完后，感到刘师长已亲手培育了新生的一代，这新生的一代，正在歌颂他们自己的大恩人。
  （五）群众争购刘师长的像
    五次大捷，在滑县大胜利后，武安城里的居民，个个眉开眼笑，都说“大树底下好乘凉，咱靠师长过好时光……”因为大家想念自己的恩人，都争着买刘师长的大挂像，据一个书店店员陈宝贤说：“近两天来，就卖去了两百多张刘师长的大挂像。还有人问我，有身上能挂的刘师长的牌牌像没有？”我答：“没有！”他们说：“为什么不做，什么时候可以做出来，做出来要贴广告呀！”我很老实告他：“现在有困难，做不出来。”这话像冷水一样浇在问话者的身上，使他们很不高兴的说：你们天天都说为老百姓服务，难道我们愿意挂常胜将军的像，你们也不替我们办到吗？”我听了后，没回答；只想刚才他们说过的话，话里含藏着很深很长的滋味。（续完）
