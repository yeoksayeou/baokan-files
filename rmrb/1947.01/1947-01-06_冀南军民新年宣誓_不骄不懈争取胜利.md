Reader Opinion

    [This newspaper's dispatch from Wei County, 3rd] Not being complacent or slack, continuing the effort, and striving for victory in the self-defense war, this is the New Year's oath of the military and civilians throughout the Southern Hebei region. Two thousand eight hundred young and strong men from Hengshui rushed to the self-defense front on the eve of the New Year. The Yuancheng County Committee specifically called on cadres at all levels to conduct ideological and organizational preparations, work intensively to help the masses clear the fields and empty houses, and when the enemy arrives, organize the masses and militia to carry out guerrilla warfare and landmine warfare, vowing to remain steadfast and adhere to their work posts. The County Command and the Military Committee instructed all districts and villages to quickly establish command posts, reorganize militia organizations, carry out large-scale military training, implement village-to-village joint defense, and conduct sentry duty and check pedestrians. After receiving the instructions, the Fifth District immediately gathered fifty-four militiamen from twenty villages, training them while maintaining local public security. All cadres in the Eighth District and teachers and students of the Third Gao (likely a school name) successively took oaths, unanimously proposing to work intensively, adhere to their posts, and rather die than submit. In several villages in the Seventh District, public and private grain has been universally hidden in two days and nights. The Dongguan Town of the Sixth District combined martial arts training with the reorganization of militia organizations. Over four hundred emancipated masses in the Eighth District, with more than fifty stretchers, have been rushing to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front for days. Their feet were all blistered after returning, but everyone's spirits are still very high. They said: "Once our feet are better, we have to cooperate with our troops and go all out to defeat old Chiang." Wucheng, Gaotang, Qiu County, Wuxun, Hengshui and other counties are stepping up military training and preparing for war, combining preparation for war with rent reduction, and digging air-raid shelters in urban areas and towns, establishing county and district command posts to unify wartime leadership. Now all localities are actively engaged in military training, preparing to eliminate the invading army on the land it invades.
