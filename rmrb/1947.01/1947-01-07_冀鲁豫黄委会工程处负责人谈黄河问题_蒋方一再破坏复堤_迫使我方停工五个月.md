Chiang Kai-shek Repeatedly Destroys Dyke Restoration

Forcing Our Side to Suspend Work for Five Months

If the Chiang Kai-shek side can abide by the previous agreements and disburse the funds and materials needed for the five months of dyke restoration work, our side will definitely be able to complete the project as scheduled.

[Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office on the 6th] Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan area's Yellow River old course dyke restoration project, due to the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Changqing, Qihe, Changyuan and other places harassing us last summer while we were carrying out dyke restoration, arresting and killing our dyke restoration cadres, dispersing the dyke repair workers, and repeatedly delaying the payment of wages and materials to 4.9 billion yuan, in addition to the large-scale invasion of our area by the Chiang Kai-shek troops since August last year, looting dyke repair equipment and materials, forced us to completely suspend work on August 15, which has been five months. Recently, our representatives have reopened negotiations with the Chiang Kai-shek side in Nanjing. Under the condition that the Chiang Kai-shek side abide by the Nanjing, Shanghai and other river management agreements, our side will continue to carry out dyke restoration to complete the project that has not been completed in the past five months. The reporter specially visited the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee Engineering Office to inquire about the future dyke restoration project plan and the required project funds. According to the person in charge of the Engineering Office: Our five-month project plan from August 15 last year to January 15 this year has already been formulated, but unfortunately it has not been realized due to the Chiang Kai-shek side's breach of contract. If the Chiang Kai-shek side implements the agreement in the future, our side will definitely be able to realize this plan in the next five months. The person in charge continued: In the already stipulated project plan, repairing dangerous sections requires 78,032 workdays, with a total wage of 210,525,125 yuan, and 1,975,955 catties of flour for food. Straightening the bends requires 6,900,000 cubic meters of earthwork, with a total wage of 7,245,000,000 yuan and 17,250,000 catties of flour for food. The materials needed for dangerous sections include 70 million catties of straw, 2.14 million catties of hemp, 440,000 stakes, 750,000 cubic meters of stone, 486,000 bricks, 24,000 catties of lead wire, and 1.71 million sacks, totaling 26,081,100,200 yuan (of which the lead wire and sacks should be supplied by the Chiang Kai-shek side, so the amount has not been converted). The tools needed for dangerous sections are estimated at 6,496,300 yuan. 612 transportation, traffic, and work ferry boats require a construction cost of 80,970,905,025 yuan. The construction of houses for water conservancy organs at all levels in this area is 145,100 cubic meters, requiring a construction cost of 3,389,568,500 yuan. The purchase cost of utensils for water conservancy organs at all levels is 205,990,000 yuan. The engineering administrative expenses require 5,483,663,842 yuan and more than 2,307,114 catties of flour. The total funding for the five-month dyke restoration project is: 51,180,862,542 yuan and 21,533,069 catties of flour. The person in charge finally stated: This 51.180862542 billion yuan and more than 10,766 tons of flour are only the minimum figures required for the dyke restoration project in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, and the project funds for the Bohai area of Shandong are not included. The project in that area is about one-third of that in this area.

    冀鲁豫黄委会工程处负责人谈黄河问题
    蒋方一再破坏复堤
    迫使我方停工五个月
    蒋方若能遵守历次协议并发放五个月复堤工程所需工款及物资，我方必能如期实现工程计划。
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】我冀鲁豫区黄河故道复堤工程，由于长清、齐河、长垣等地蒋军于去夏乘我进行复堤期间四出骚扰，捕杀我复堤干部，驱散修堤工人，并一再拖延工款工料至四十九亿元，加以去年八月以来蒋军大举侵犯我区，对修堤器材物资大肆劫掠，迫使我于八月十五日全部停工，至今已有五个月之久。最近我方代表已在南京与蒋方重开谈判，在蒋方遵守南京、上海等治河协议下，我方将继续进行复堤，以完成五个月来未竣之工程。记者如此特往访冀鲁豫黄委会工程处，询以今后复堤工程计划及所需工程经费。据工程处负责人谈：我方去年八月十五日至今年一月十五日五个月之工程计划早已制出，惜因蒋方违约未能实现，今后蒋方如执行协议，我方也必能于今后五个月中实现此计划。负责人继称：在已规定之工程计划中，修理险工需工七八○三二个，计工资二一○、五二五、一二五元，工粮面粉一、九七五、九五五斤，裁湾取直六、九○○、○○○公方，需工资七、二四五、○○○、○○○元。工粮面粉一七、二五○、○○○斤，险工用材料计需秸料七千万斤，麻二百十四万斤，桩四十四万根，石料七十五万方，砖四十八万六千块，铅丝二万四千斤，麻袋一百七十一万条，合款二六、○八一、一○○二○○元，（其中铅丝与麻袋两项均应由蒋方供给，故未折合款项）。险工用工具计款六、四九六、三○○元，运输、交通、工作渡船六一二艘，需建造费八○、九七○、九○五、○二五元，本区各级水利机关建筑房屋一四五、一○○立方公尺，需建筑费三、三八九、五六八、五○○元，各级水利机关用具购置费二○五、九九○、○○○元，工程行政经费需款五、四八三、六六三、八四二元，需面粉二、三○七、一一四斤以上。五个月复堤工程总结经费为：款五一、一八○、八六二、五四二元，面粉二一、五三三、○六九斤。负责人最后声称：此五百十一亿八千余万元及一万零七百六十六吨余之面粉，乃仅冀鲁豫区复堤工程所需之最低数字，而山东渤海区之工程经费尚未包括在内，该区工程约为本区之三分之一。
