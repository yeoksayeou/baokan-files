    Hongdong Militia Guerrilla Force
    Launches Full-Scale Bombing Offensive
    Three Days of Killing or Capturing Thirty-Six Enemies
    [This Dispatch from Yangcheng, 25th] Under the call to defend the people's emancipation and "holding a gun in one hand and settling accounts in the other," the Hongdong County militia bombing squads and guerrilla forces launched a siege, bombing, and sniper offensive against the enemy. From the 4th to the 6th, they killed or wounded 31 enemies and captured 5 alive. The most outstanding was the bombing campaign led by comrades Shi Xianying and Li Xiushan, who skillfully lured the enemy and killed 12. On the 3rd, comrades Shi Xianying and Li Xiushan led seven militiamen to lay a minefield on the highway from Hongdong to Subao. They placed three hand grenades in a bag full of lime, nailing the detonating fuse to the ground. On the 5th, over 120 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion of the 81st Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the Chiang army in Subao passed by the area and saw a bag of white flour on the ground with a letter on it, which read, "×× Mill sends fifty catties of white flour to the Guard 1st Regiment." The Chiang soldiers were overjoyed, and about 20 of them immediately rushed to grab the white flour. As soon as they picked up the bag, the mother and son mines detonated together. In the ensuing chaos, they stepped on another stone mine, killing a total of 5 enemies and wounding 7.
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 25th] The Taiyue Second Military Sub-district militia self-defense force, in the two months from November 10th to January 10th, killed, wounded, or captured a total of 756 Chiang, Yan, and puppet troops, reaching 250% of the original enemy annihilation plan. Now the Military Committee is calling for the continued annihilation of 500 enemies. Since the launch of the enemy annihilation campaign by the militia in eight counties of the Second Military Sub-district, including Fushan, Hongdong, Yicheng, Linfen, Quwo, Jiangxian, Xiangling, and Qinshui, a competition has been launched between counties, districts, and villages. For example, the Xiangling militia continuously operated west of the Fen River for five consecutive nights, annihilating 25 Yan puppet troops. Yicheng killed or captured 146 Chiang and Yan soldiers in two months, exceeding the target by 300%. The area achieved such brilliant results thanks to the following combat experiences: (1) During our army's counter-offensive in Quwo and Yicheng, the militia cooperated in combat, capturing scattered soldiers and special agents. (2) The Fushan militia used a spider web joint defense, killing 35 enemies in half a month. (3) Shang Qingfu's Flying Bombing Team launched a traffic operation by dispersing and sniping. (4) The Weicun militia in Yicheng took the initiative to attack the enemy's Dajiao stronghold, capturing the enemy's deputy company commander, etc. (5) Yemo Fushan: Zhangzhuang militia entered the stronghold at night to capture the enemy.
