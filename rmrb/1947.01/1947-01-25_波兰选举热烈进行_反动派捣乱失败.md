　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. Warsaw Radio reported that elections in all provinces and regions of Poland are being held in a calm and enthusiastic atmosphere. Twenty-five percent of voters cast their ballots in the first hour of the election, and in Olsztyn Province, 90 percent of voters had gone to the polls by 11:20 AM. According to preliminary reports, in places where Mikołajczyk (right-wing leader, agent of Anglo-American reactionaries in Poland) called on voters to boycott the vote, many people still went to vote. The reactionary underground terrorist organizations intimidated voters in some places, but to no effect. On election day, a festive atmosphere permeated Warsaw.
