    Five Hundred Farmers from Daming Join the Army
    An Qinshu, a Party Member from Xiaozhai, Jize,
    Convinces Twelve Militiamen to Enlist
    Wipe Out the Invading Chiang Troops!
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 8th dispatch] After the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops occupied Daming, the liberated peasants, cadres, and party members of the Third Sub-district successively led the masses to join the army, vowing to wipe out the Chiang Kai-shek's troops in southern Hebei. Thirty-seven young men from the first district of Daming signed up to join the army under the leadership of Zhu Chengde and three other district cadres. When the second district held a mass mobilization meeting, one hundred and thirty-six young men enlisted. Zhang Xiuyun and sixteen other women from Jiangtun Village sent their husbands to join the army. Village head Zhang Guangliang led all the village's militiamen and forty-five young men to the front lines. The meeting place was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and ten thousand people held a banquet to send them off. Several old gentlemen said: "When the people are of one heart, yellow earth turns into gold; Chiang Kai-shek will inevitably die at the hands of the people!" An Qinshu, a communist party member of Xiaozhai Town, Jize, became the driving force for joining the army, convincing twelve militiamen to go to the front line. Jize is now launching the An Qinshu campaign in various village branches and militias. Under the influence of An Qinshu, Wang Ke of Tingyantou led nineteen young men to the battlefield collectively. More than seventy liberated women from Baicun and other villages joined the militia, handling drills and throwing grenades as well as the men. From December 20th to 27th, 520 liberated youths from the entire county have gone to the front lines. Wang Suhua, the women's militia captain of the Sixth District, mobilized her husband to join the army, staying up all night to get him to understand. Pei Tongyun of × Village, Second District, Linzhang, under the slogan "The people of Linzhang must defend Linzhang, and the liberated peasants must defend their fruits," immediately persuaded his son to join the county brigade. Within two days, one hundred and sixty young men from the third and fourth districts of Guangping collectively joined the army.
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 8th dispatch] The military and civilians of the First Sub-district of southern Hebei have entered a state of tense war. Guanxian is actively preparing for war, vowing to resist strongly with all its strength and let the enemy die on the soil of southern Hebei. Cadres in the first, fourth, and seventh districts of Yuanchao are universally launching a style-checking campaign, examining how their relationship with the masses is? Is there any phenomenon of being detached from the masses? How is their understanding of the current situation? Are there any ideas of paralysis, optimism, retreat, and escape? Everyone has established a covenant on work, discipline, and relations with the masses to be jointly observed. The fifth district is carrying out anti-espionage work. In addition to exposing the rumors spread by spies, they have cracked espionage organization cases involving Guo Fenggu, Guo Chengyu, and Liu Jiezhen. Advanced elementary schools have established war service teams, which have gone to the front lines to serve or are taking care of the wounded in the rear. Yongzhi and Qiuxian are reorganizing and expanding the militia organization. A wave of joining the army has been created throughout Guanxian. To welcome the war, the entire city's militia, defense teams, and cadres of various agencies in Linqing held a night exercise on December 27th of last year.
