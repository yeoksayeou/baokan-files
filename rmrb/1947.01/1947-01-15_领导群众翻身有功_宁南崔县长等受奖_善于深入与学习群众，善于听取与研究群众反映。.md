Rewarded for Leading the Masses to Emancipation
　　County Head Cui of Ningnan and Others Rewarded
  　Skilled at Immersing Themselves in and Learning from the Masses, Skilled at Listening to and Studying Mass Reflections.
    [Our Newspaper Weixian Thirteenth Dispatch] Comrade Cui Shaowu, the County Head of Ningnan, and Comrade Jiao Gengfu of the Special Commissioner's Office Emancipation Team, have been commended by the Fourth Special Commissioner's Office for their meritorious service in leading the peasants to emancipation. The order calls on cadres of all county governments to learn from their exemplary deeds. 1. Be good at going deep into the masses, listening to the masses' reflections, and humbly learning from the masses. Every time County Head Cui goes to work in a village, he goes to the streets, alleys, and threshing grounds to talk to peasants and women about emancipation. In order to deal with problems in the movement, he personally participated in various meetings in Dongwang and visited more than 20 peasant households. County Head Cui often said, "How can I come up with a solution on my own? When something happens, I put down my airs and discuss it with the masses." Adults and children in Dongwang and the villages he often visits are very familiar with him. When they meet him, they tell him about their emancipation and work. Comrade Jiao Gengfu led the peasants in Nandingcao to emancipation. In order to listen to the reflections of the masses, he followed the wealthy households and ate meals in turn. The peasants regarded him as one of their own, without the slightest sense of distance. 2. Not only are they good at listening to the reflections of the masses, but they are also good at studying the reflections of the masses and solving them. In Nandingcao, Comrade Jiao Gengfu conducted in-depth visits from the beginning of the movement, gathering the reflections of the masses and studying the masses' psychological demands and ideological obstacles. Therefore, the movement in Nandingcao progressed very quickly and smoothly from beginning to end, creating a systematic set of ideological education experiences. After conducting in-depth investigations in Dongwang Dongzhen, County Head Cui, based on the opinions of the masses, mobilized the women of the entire village to carry out the women's movement, opening up the situation for the women's movement in the county. Comrades Cui and Jiao gained experience from in-depth research, which made a great contribution to the entire movement in the county, and also played a great role in consolidating the agricultural movement and developing the women's movement in the counties west of the Fu River, as well as the general inspection movement in the counties east of the Fu River.
