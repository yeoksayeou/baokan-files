Noble Revolutionary Sentiments
    Ma Fengnian

    One day at noon, at a conference of the Ministry of Health, Minister Zhan, with a sallow complexion and slender figure, said, "I want to donate blood to the soldiers at the front, and complete my work tasks by 100%." Every comrade stared at this thin Minister Zhan with wide eyes, surprised that he, with such a weak body, still wanted to donate blood. Everyone was deeply moved, and then doctors, nurses, cooks, and animal keepers all asked to donate blood. A young nurse who had just come over from the Chiang army during the Shangguan battle was also deeply moved by this noble revolutionary sentiment, and stood up and said, "I will also donate 100cc." Everyone shouted "Good!" after hearing his words. In the end, a total of 28,000cc of blood was donated to the soldiers at the front. I was astonished by this number, and immediately grabbed Minister Zhan's hand and asked, "Minister! Will your work be affected by donating so much blood?" He shook his head and said, "No, we have donated blood to the soldiers at the front in the Dayang Lake battle, the Renzhuang battle, and the Shangguan battle, without exception. Our cook, after donating blood, kneaded 700 catties of flour in one day to prevent the wounded from going hungry. His arms were swollen like steamed buns. I told him to rest, but he said, 'The soldiers at the front shed blood, can't we shed a little sweat?' Our young nurse, in order to prevent the wounded from suffering, didn't close her eyes for seven days and seven nights. Her eyes were swollen like red dates, but she still insisted on working. Finally, when she couldn't hold on any longer, she lay down on the bed, and even mumbled in her dreams, 'Comrade, be gentle when you change the dressing, don't let the wounded suffer'." There are many more things like this. Moved by this noble revolutionary sentiment, tears streamed down my face.

    高尚的革命感情
    马丰年
    一天的中午，卫生部的大会上，面孔黄黄、身材细高的詹部长说：“我要给前方的将士输血，并百分之百的完成我的工作任务”。每个同志，都直瞪起两眼望着这个瘦长的詹部长，惊异着像他这样弱的身体，还要输血。大家深受感动，接着医生、看护、炊事员、饲养员，都纷纷要求输血。在上官战斗中刚从蒋军过来的小看护，也深深的被这高尚的革命感情所感动，也站起来说：“我也输一百西西”，大家听了他的话，不由的喊出“好！”。最后总计给前方将士输血两万八千西西。我被这数字所惊愕，立即便拉住詹部长的手问：“部长！你们输这样多的血，工作不受影响吗？”他摇摇头说：“不会的，我们在大杨湖战斗、任庄战斗、上官战斗，无一次不给前方战士输血的。我们的炊事员输血后，为了伤员不挨饿，一天内和了七百斤白面，两个胳膊肿的像蒸馍似的，我叫他休息，他说：“前方战士流了血，咱还不能流点汗吗？”。我们的小看护，为了不使伤员受痛苦，七天七夜连眼皮都没有合，两眼肿的像红枣一样，但仍然坚持工作，最后支持不下了，才躺在床上，并且在梦中还喃喃的说：“同志，你换药手轻一点，千万别让伤员受痛”。像这样的事情还多着哩。”被这高尚的革命感情所感动，我眼里不由的流下泪来。
