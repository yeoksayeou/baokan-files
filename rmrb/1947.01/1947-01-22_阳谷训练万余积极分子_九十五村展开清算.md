[Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 20th] The land-to-the-tiller movement in Yanggu is unfolding universally. Following the mobilization meeting by the County Party Committee, each district, on one hand, concentrated on training local tyrants and landlords, helping the masses "move the stones," and on the other hand, convened peasant emancipation conferences and village cadre activist meetings with five hundred to one thousand eight hundred participants. The county has trained a total of ten thousand five hundred activists, who have become the vanguard force in this movement, breaking open the stagnant situation. More than thirty activists from Hucun in the Fifth District returned to their village, actively expanding membership and planning struggles. In three days, they organized a liquidation struggle against the local tyrant Hu Bingzhen, quickly opening up the situation in seventeen villages in the entire sub-district. More than two thousand masses successively liquidated the landlord Li ×× from Lilou Village and the local tyrant landlord Huang Shanyan from Yangtun Village. The Sixth District is a new district with a relatively weak work foundation. Although struggles had been carried out, feudal landlords colluding with lurking enemy and puppet remnants still ruled the masses in most villages. This time, when the peasant emancipation conference was convened, more than nine hundred people from various villages attended, celebrating the implementation of land reform with stilt walkers, flower boats, and the sound of gongs and drums. The peasants excitedly discussed, "In the past, it was congratulating District Chief He and Township Chief He, but now it's congratulating the poor!" On the second day of the meeting, a public trial conference was organized with more than two thousand people. The government responded to the demands of the masses and executed the traitor Hao Daopeng, who was hated by the masses, on the spot, greatly satisfying the people's hearts, and they saw the government's supportive attitude from the facts. The peasants' thinking was also improved through discussions in the form of symposiums to trace the roots of poverty and pour out grievances. After the peasant emancipation conference concluded, the first shots fired in the entire district were in the Ningchang and Jiaohai sub-districts, where more than eight hundred people jointly struggled against the traitorous landlord Chu Laoba. Chu Laoba colluded with Liu Jichun, the puppet captain of Yanggu, and once forcibly collected eighteen catties of grain per mu from the people. After reasoned struggle, the fruits of the struggle were distributed on the spot, with each attendee receiving two sorghum stalks and more than ten catties of grain. The masses excitedly said, "Chu Laoba has been struggled against, if we don't act now, when will we?" The peasants who carried sorghum stalks back to their villages were even more delighted, saying, "In previous years, even pulling a sorghum stalk from Chu Laoba would result in beatings and scolding, but this time it is a real emancipation." After participating in the struggle, the masses of Ningchang returned to their villages in the evening and liquidated the two local tyrant landlords in their villages. They continued to discuss the distribution of the fruits the next day. In three days, twenty-eight villages, including Zhuanghai, Liuhuhe, and others, launched liquidation struggles. Currently, the movement is spreading like wildfire throughout the county. According to the current situation in various districts, ninety-five villages in the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Districts alone have more than twenty-three thousand masses involved in the tide of struggle. In more than forty large and small liquidation struggles, more than three thousand six hundred mu of land has been returned to the peasants.

　　阳谷训练万余积极分子
    九十五村展开清算
    【本报冀鲁豫廿日电】阳谷土地还家运动，正在普遍展开。继县委动员大会后，各区一方面集中恶霸地主受训，替群众“搬石头”，一面召集了五百人到一千八百人的农民翻身大会和村干积极分子会议。全县总计训练了一万零五百个积极分子，成为这次运动的先锋力量，轰开了消沉局面。五区胡村三十多个积极分子回到村里，一面积极扩大会员，一面酝酿斗争，三天便组织了对恶霸胡秉震的清算斗争，全小区十七个村的局面很快就打开了，两千余群众先后清算了李楼村地主李××，杨屯村恶霸地主黄善言。六区是个新区，工作基础比较薄弱，虽进行过斗争，但封建地主勾结潜伏的敌伪残余，仍然在大部分村庄统治着群众。这次召开农民翻身会议时，各村共到九百多人，有高跷花船，锣鼓喧天的庆祝实行土地改革，农民们兴奋地议论着：“过去都是贺区长、贺乡长，现在是贺穷人啦”！会议的第二天，组织了两千多人的公审大会，政府答复群众要求，当场枪毙了群众痛恨的汉奸郝道鹏，人心大快，从事实中看到了政府撑腰的态度。又用座谈的方式追穷根，倒苦水，到会农民的思想提高了。农民翻身会议结束，全区第一炮打响的是宁昌、焦海两个小区，八百多人联合斗争汉奸地主褚老八。褚老八勾结阳谷伪大队长刘继春，一次曾向人民每亩地一次强征粮食十八斤。讲理斗争后，当场即分配斗争果实，到会群众每个人分到秫秸二个，粮食十余斤，群众兴奋的说：“褚老八都斗啦，这时不干啥时干”。扛着秫秸回村的农民更高兴的说：“往年拔褚老八一根秫秸也得挨打挨骂，这回是真翻身啦”。宁昌群众参加了斗争，晚上回到本村便清算了本村的两个恶霸地主，第二日天明又接着讨论分配果实。三天工夫，庄海、刘胡赫等二十八个村庄，都掀起了清算斗争。现全县的运动，正像烈火一样的蔓延着。综合目前各区情况，一、五、六、八四个区即有九十五个村，二万三千众多群卷入斗争热潮。在大小四十余次清算斗争中，有三千六百多亩土地归还了农民。
