    Xingtai Normal School Troupe Goes to the Front Lines

    Since its establishment before the new year, the student drama troupe of Xingtai Normal School has toured the six districts of Xingtai performing "The White Haired Girl," which was warmly welcomed by the masses. Now, in response to the call from the Department of Education and the Education Department of the Administrative Office to carry out cultural work to comfort the troops on the front lines during the winter vacation, the troupe set off for the ×× front lines on the 16th of this month. The entire troupe consists of more than sixty male and female students, led by three teachers from the school.
