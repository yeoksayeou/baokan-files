　　"Leaving the City is Like Arriving in Paradise"
    Yongnian Refugees and Puppet Soldiers Escape; Everyone Receives Property in Mass Movements
    [Our newspaper, Wei County, 15th dispatch] In the mass movement to achieve liberation in Yongnian, refugees and former puppet soldiers who had escaped from the city occupied by puppet troops have been allocated land and property, enabling them to settle down smoothly. These refugees, after escaping to the liberated areas, have received care from the masses and the government. They all received land and property in the mass movements. In Shiguan Camp, there were 60 refugee households, totaling 190 people, who received over 250 mu of land. When this reporter interviewed refugee representative Mr. Zhang Ruqing, he said, "The villagers treat the refugees like their own brothers. Everyone offered housing, and when distributing fruit, they shared with us equally." Regarding life in the city in the past, he said with deep sorrow, "In the city, in order to make a living, I ran a small wine shop, but with all the donations and dues…I had to close down. Life was without support, suffering from hunger and abuse, so I had to escape. The 'Iron Grinding Head' often deceived us, saying, 'Once you leave the city, the Eighth Route Army will kill you all'; but in reality, when we arrived outside the city, it was like arriving in paradise. When my family first came out, we were all dizzy and had swollen legs. Thanks to the help of the villagers and the government's relief, I was given 500 jin of wheat, and I got good nourishment. It was truly a survival from the brink of death." Poor young men who had been conscripted into the puppet army, after surrendering and repenting to the masses, were still allocated fruits of the revolution and received land during the mass movement. When land was distributed in Dongdaci, they received the same share as the masses, but when distributing movable property, they received one level lower than the masses. The four households who voluntarily defected and joined our army received land and movable property as military dependents. They all said, "The democratic government is so good to us, we must actively do good things for the masses, resolutely defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and perform meritorious service to atone for our sins."

　　“到了城外如到天堂”
    永年逃出难民伪军  群运中都分到财产
    【本报威县十五日电】永年群众翻身运动中，由伪军盘据的城内逃出的难民和反正伪军都分到土地和财物，得以顺利安家。这些难民逃到解放区后，备受群众及政府的爱护，在群运中都得了土地、财物。石管营有难民六十户，一百九十口人，共分到二百五十余亩地。记者访问难民代表张汝清先生时，他说：“村中对难民真象亲兄弟，大家让给房子，分果实时，照样分给我们。”对于过去在城里的生活，他沉痛的说：“在城里为了顾生活，弄个小酒铺，什么捐款、会费……，弄得都关了门，生活无依托，挨饥受气，只得逃出来。‘铁磨头’常欺骗我们说：‘出了城，八路军都杀了’；其实我们到了城外，就如到了天堂。我家刚出来时，都是眼花腿肿，靠乡亲们帮助，政府救济，给了我五百斤麦子，得了好养料，真是死里逃生。”被抓走的贫苦青年当伪军者，反正并向群众悔过后，在群运当中，照样分得了果实，得到了土地。东大慈分地时他们和群众一样分，分浮财时则比群众降一级。自动反正参加我军的四户，则按军属分到土地和浮财，他们都说：“民主政府对我们这样好，我们一定积极为群众办好事，坚决打败蒋介石，立功赎罪”。
