Experiences in the In-Depth Movement Phase of Land Reform in the New Wu'an District
    Wang Tingdong
    "Struggle against both Old Chiang and Little Chiang, ensure that no household is left behind in the liberation." This was the slogan of the intensive movement in Wu'an New District in December. Between the New Year and the old, inspired by the victories at the front, villages launched in-depth movements to "cut off the tail," achieving the following preliminary experiences:
    I. Continuing the In-Depth Movement with One Mighty Effort: Starting with the "face-washing" movement, we adopted a short-term training program for more than 1,200 village cadres and activists, making it clear to everyone that "I am for the revolution, the revolution is for me; I love the masses, the masses love me." The idea that "progress can only be made by frequently listening to the opinions of the masses," coupled with the impact of district and county cadres returning fruits purchased cheaply, prompted them to generally take the initiative to examine themselves upon returning to their villages, humbly solicit public opinion, issue lists, and change their attitudes. Cadres in Shangquan, Xiaquan, Chongyi, and Nanzhuang asked the masses: "If you think the cadres are one of you, give the cadres your opinions. If you don't want to give them in a general meeting, you can give them in a group or write a note." After the masses gave their opinions, the cadres stated that they would not bear grudges and would resolutely fight the landlords and resolutely fight Old Chiang in the future. The masses in Nanzhuang made it clear that "the cadres are ours; the face-washing is so that they can do a better job for us, not to overthrow the cadres."
    Next, everyone checked for tails, and everyone cut off tails. In checking for tails, class lines were clearly drawn, and tails were distinguished between large and small. Internally, covering up was opposed, and the backward were mobilized; externally, documents and "heaven-changing accounts" were pursued. Internally, no force was used; externally, the struggle was thorough. After the masses in Dong Kongbi discovered the landlord's "heaven-changing account," they broke the line between activists and the backward, unanimously believing that reactionary landlords were the common enemy of the peasants. Thirty villages in the Eighth District have cut off 326 feudal tails. Next was everyone finding bumps and everyone filling bumps: holding family meetings, with men, women, old, and young all speaking, distributing what was lacking, self-reporting and self-determining the distribution, with the masses participating in the evaluation, everyone taking pains, everyone feeling at ease. After the bumps were filled, they were divided equally, and the remaining things were used to level things out. In Nanhezhuang, many poor military families received extra portions. In Dahezhuang, women and children who actively participated in the struggle were rewarded. Thirty villages in the Eighth District have filled 677 bumps. In the distribution of fruits, the timing was seized, and joint meetings were held to vent grievances in one fell swoop. The slogan was: "A thousand years of grievances are avenged once, contending for both steamed buns and dignity; bitterness ends and sweetness comes, spending a good liberation year." Those who didn't speak in the past spoke first, and spoke more, calling on bullies to admit their mistakes. The more thoroughly the grievances were aired, the more the landlords lowered their heads, and the more the peasants felt the struggle was justified.
    II. Letting Go and Mobilizing Layer by Layer: First, for women, the county called for organizing all peasant women to join the peasant association, and dozens of women leaders led women's liberation teams in each base, becoming active everywhere. Another 800 liberated women in 30 villages in the Eighth District newly joined the peasant association. In mobilizing women, vivid slogans were put forward: To male members: "Men and women are of one mind in liberation, completely breaking with the landlords!" "One person suffers poverty, the whole family suffers; the whole family is liberated, the whole family struggles!" "Overcome men advancing and women dragging their feet, men struggling and women leaking secrets!" "Losing women means losing half the time!" "Without mobilizing women, the landlord's tail cannot be completely cut off!" To women: "Men suffer poverty, the whole family suffers; women suffer even more than men!" "Men and women are of one mind, men and women compete for progress!" "Only when women can vent their anger and struggle, and live a liberated life, can they have status!" In organizing women, either male members first mobilized peasant association families, or female activists quickly colluded. Women all had the desire to join the peasant association, and they first complained about not being admitted to the association in the past: "Liberation means not listening to meetings." "Men don't trust themselves." Then they compared themselves with landlord women, complaining about the past suffering of serving people, picking crops, borrowing livestock, and using mills. The women of Xizhouzhuang said: "Landlord women come in sedan chairs and go on horseback, wearing silk and satin, watching operas and attending fairs. We come to the mill and go to the grinding stone, eating bran and vegetables and suffering beatings." In the struggle, the old female members of the peasant association led the new female members, and took care of the busy work of young and middle-aged women watching the door, taking care of children and household affairs, and the inconvenience of holding general meetings at night. There are three characteristics in organizing women: First, do everything together. Second, men and women cooperate and men and women compete, women compete with each other, and rewards are given immediately for achievements, and support is given immediately for difficulties. Third, the leading role is very important; without a leader, there is no women's movement.
    Second is the middle peasant question. Most middle peasants have two doubts: One is fear of being "cut like leeks" (i.e., repeatedly exploited), and the other is that they are satisfied with breaking even and do not seek profit but seek not to be struggled against. In the general convening of "middle peasant reassurance meetings" and "peasant family meetings," the poor and hired peasants recognized that "middle and poor peasants are all ruled by landlords, and the poor peasants of today are all transformed from middle peasants who were exploited by landlords." "Middle peasants have more contact with landlords and understand landlords. The participation of middle peasants in the struggle makes the struggle more reasonable and powerful." "The struggle is to seize the exploitation accounts. If the middle peasant does not owe us anything, we cannot struggle against them." The middle peasants recognized that "we suffer more than the poor peasants, we pay more high rents and high interest, and we pay more levies and taxes. Without overthrowing feudalism, we cannot live a good life." "We have no status in the village, and even being a village head is a living torment." "In the past, we wanted to follow the rich, looking down on the poor; now we want to follow the masses. We must participate in the struggle and make more contributions to be considered part of the middle and poor peasant family." In filling in the bumps, the losses suffered by middle peasants are being taken care of. A middle peasant household said: "I would be happy to get a broom, because I am standing on the mass line." Another 500 middle peasant households in 30 villages in the Eighth District have newly joined the struggle and participated in the distribution.
    On the issue of dealing with the backward, as long as cadres and activists overcome their contempt for the backward, as long as cadres and activists let go and allow the backward masses to interject and participate, and then conduct individual education for the most backward elements by holding family meetings, mobilizing them to participate in the struggle and participate in filling in the gaps, a large number of new activists will emerge, the backward will be eliminated. Three hundred and eighty-five new activists have emerged in 30 villages in the Eighth District, becoming a vital force in the December movement, and 865 backward elements have also changed.
    III. Combining Liberation with Defending Liberation: First, resolutely strike at the bad elements' attempts to restore the old order and spread rumors. Pianshan and Shili Dian created the experience of mass reconnaissance and struggle and the experience of solving cases. Xi Dahe created the experience of defeating special agents who tried to take advantage of loopholes. The joint guarantee struggle in the Second and Eighth Districts brought the pressure of the masses to bear on reactionary elements. Under the slogan of "uproot the roots of poverty, plant the roots of wealth, and practice martial arts to make thunder to protect our lives," the masses made more than 50,000 thunderbolts. In the political rectification of the militia, 3% of the bad elements were purged, and new militia were developed. In martial arts training, the militia averaged more than three rings per shot in target practice.
    IV. Overcoming Simplistic Work Style: Cadres overcame the "more or less the same" mentality and simplistic work style after the big movement, and further clarified that letting go means the masses seeking their own liberation, and corrected the one-sided views on the in-depth stage (such as: in-depth means working slowly, means one person being in charge of one village, means simply mobilizing middle peasants, means simply engaging in ideological and political struggle, means simply changing the method of struggle, etc.). After the New Year, with another burst of energy, land reform will be completely completed before spring plowing.

　　武安新区土地改革
    深入运动阶段经验
    王庭栋
    “老蒋小蒋一齐斗，翻身不能落一户。”这是武安新区腊月运动的口号。新年到旧年间在前线捷报的鼓舞下，村村开展割尾巴的深入运动，获得以下初步经验：
    一、一股劲的继续深入：先从洗脸运动入手，我们采用了一千二百多村干部积极分子的短训，使大家明确了，我为革命，革命为我，我爱群众，群众爱我。”“经常能听到群众意见才能进步”的思想，加上区县干部退回贱买果实的影响，使他们回村后，普遍的主动检讨自己，虚心征求民意，出清单，改态度。上泉、下泉、崇义、南庄的干部要求群众：“如果认为干部是和大家一家人，就要给干部提意见，不愿在大会提，可以小组提或写条。”群众提了意见后，干部又表明决不记仇，今后坚决斗争地主，坚决打老蒋的态度。南庄群众明确提出“干部是咱们的，洗脸为了更给咱好好干，不是为了推倒干部。”
    其次进行大家查尾巴，大家割尾巴。在查尾巴中划清阶级，并分别大小尾巴，对内反包庇与发动落后结合，对外追文书和变天账；对内不动武，对外彻底斗。东孔壁群众发现了地主的变天账后，打破了积极落后的界线，一致认为反动地主是农民的公敌，八区三十个村已割掉三百廿六个封建尾巴。接着是大家找圪道大家填圪道：开家庭会，男女老小都发言，缺啥分啥，自报自定分，群众都参加评议，大家费心，大家放心。填了圪道按等分，剩下东西再补平。南贺庄贫苦军属多定分。大贺庄奖励斗争积极的妇女儿童。八区三十村已填平圪道六百七十七户。在分果实中抓紧火候，再开联合大会，一揽子诉苦出气，口号是：“千年冤仇一次报，又争馒头又争气，苦尽甜才来，过好翻身年。”过去不说话的人先说话，多说话，叫恶霸认错误。苦越诉的透，地主越低头，农民越感到斗争有理。
    二、一层层的放手发动：首先是对妇女，县里号召组织全部农民妇女入农会，数十位妇女领袖领导各基点的妇女翻身队，到处活跃。八区三十个村又有八百翻身妇女新入了农会。在发动妇女中提出了生动的口号：对男会员：“翻身男女一条心，和地主彻底分心！”“一人受穷，一家受罪，全家翻身，全家斗争！”“克服男人前进，女人拉腿，男人斗争，女人透气！”“丢了妇女丢一半时光！”“不发动妇女，地主尾巴就割不彻底！”对妇女：“男人受穷，全家受苦，女人比男人更苦！”“男女一条心，男女比进步！”“妇女能出气斗争，过翻身时光才能有地位！”在组织妇女中或是通过男会员首先发动农会家庭，或是通过妇女积极分子迅速串通。妇女都有入农会的要求，他们首先对过去不吸收他们入会诉说不满：“翻身不能听会。”“男人不相信自己。”接着就和地主妇女对比，诉说过去侍候人、拾庄稼、借牲口、使碾磨等痛苦。西周庄妇女说：“地主妇女是轿上来，马上去，穿绸摔缎，瞧唱赶会。咱们是磨道来，碾道去，吃糠咽菜挨打受气。”在斗争中农会的老女会员带领新女会员，并照顾青壮年妇女看门，领小孩理家务之繁忙，与夜里开大会之不方便。组织妇女有三个特点，一是要干一齐干。二是男女合作男女比赛，妇女互相比赛，一有成绩马上奖励，一有困难马上撑腰。三是带头作用很重要，没有带头人就没了妇女运动。
    其次是中农问题，大部中农有两种怀疑：一是怕割韭菜，一是够本就算，不求得利但求不挨斗。在普遍的召开“中农放心会”，“农民一家会”中，贫雇农认识了：“中贫农都受地主统治，现在的贫农回头想想都是中农被地主剥削变成的。”“中农和地主来往多，了解地主，中农参加斗争，斗争就更有理有力。”“斗争是要剥削帐，中农不欠咱的就不能斗争。”中农认识了：“咱比贫农更吃亏，高租高利咱出的多，派粮派款咱出的多，不打倒封建，咱的时光就不能过。”“咱在村上没地位，就当个甲长也是活受罪。”“过去咱想跟老财走，看不起穷人；如今咱要跟群众走，咱必须参加斗争多立功，才算中贫农一家人。”在填平中对受损失的中农正在进行照顾，中农户说：“我能分个扫帚也高兴，因为我站到群众路线上了。”八区三十个村又有五百多户中农新参加斗争，参加分配。
    在对待落后问题上只要干部积极分子打破轻视落后，只要干部积极分子放手，让落后群众能插上嘴插上手，再对最落后分子开家庭会进行个别教育，发动他们参加斗争参加填平，就会出现大量的新积极分子，就会消灭落后。八区三十个村已产生三百八十五个新积极分子，成为腊月运动的有生力量，并有八百六十五个落后分子也改变了。
    三、翻身结合保卫翻身：首先是坚决打击坏分子的复辟企图造谣活动，骈山、十里店创造了群众侦察斗争的经验和破案经验，西大河创造了打垮特务钻空的经验，二、八区的连环保斗争，发挥了群众对反动分子的压力。在“拔穷根、栽富根、练武造雷保命根”的口号下，群众造雷五万以上，民兵政治整训中，清洗了百分之三的坏成份，又发展了新民兵，练武中民兵打靶平均一枪三环以上。
    四、克服简单化作风：干部在运动中克服了大动后的差不多思想和简单作风，更明确了放手就是群众自求解放，纠正了对深入阶段的片面观点，（如：深入就是慢慢作，就是一人把着一村干，就是单纯发动中农，就是单纯搞思想、斗政治，就是单纯转变斗争方式等）过年后再鼓一把劲，春耕前定能彻底完成土地改革。
