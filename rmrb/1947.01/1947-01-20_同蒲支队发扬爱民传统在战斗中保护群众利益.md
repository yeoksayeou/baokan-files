　　(Taiyue Frontline Dispatch, January 18th) The Tongpu Detachment, deeply rooted in the People's Liberation Army's tradition of cherishing the people, when approaching the village wall during the battle to recover Shicun, the commander shouted to the soldiers: "We are the people's army, we must not damage the people's property in the slightest." After the troops entered the village for search, they immediately withdrew outside the village, without taking anything. The two mules captured were found to have been robbed from the ordinary people of Cuijiazhuang, Xiangling by the Chiang army, and were immediately sent back to their original owners by special personnel. On the 26th of last month, the detachment intercepted two cattle and a flock of sheep stolen by the Chiang Kai-shek puppets from Xinzhuang, and returned them unconditionally to their original owners.

　　同蒲支队发扬爱民传统在战斗中保护群众利益
    【本报太岳前线十八日电】深具人民解放军爱民传统的同蒲支队，在收复史村战斗中，临近寨墙时，指挥员乃向战士喊道：“我们是人民军队，不能损坏老百姓一点东西。”部队进寨搜索后，立即撤出寨外，秋毫无犯。缴获的两头骡子，经查明是蒋军抢自襄陵崔家庄老百姓的，当即派专人送还原主。上月二十六日，该支队又截获浮出蒋伪自辛庄抢来的两头牛和一群羊，亦无条件的送还原主。
