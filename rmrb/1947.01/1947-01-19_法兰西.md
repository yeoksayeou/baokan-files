France
　　In history, France has experienced three bourgeois democratic revolutions and three suppressions of the revival of the imperial system before the birth of the French Republic. The "Paris Commune" at the end of 1871 was the first glorious victory of the world proletariat in seizing power.

　　In World War I, it joined the Allied Powers, defeated Germany, recovered Alsace and Lorraine, territories ceded to Germany in the Franco-Prussian War, and obtained mandated colonies such as Syria.

　　During the world economic panic from 1929 to 1935, French production decreased by one-third, and the world-shaking general strike of 4.5 million people on February 12, 1934, broke out. On July 27 of the same year, the French Communist Party and the Socialist Party signed a pact for unified action to jointly oppose fascism and the 200 wealthy families who monopolized French politics and economy. This promoted the great victory of the French Popular Front in 1936 in seizing power. Participants in the Popular Front included the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Party, the General Confederation of Labor, the League of Human Rights, the Republican Frontline Veterans Association, and the People's Relief Association.

　　In the early days of World War II, due to the collusion between reactionary financial groups such as Schneider and Wendel with Hitler, and the betrayal of the people's interests by Blum and others, after the Munich Conference, a policy of alienating the Soviet Union and passively preparing for war was implemented, and France quickly fell. On June 22, 1940, French traitors led by Pétain signed the shameful "Compiègne Forest Armistice" with Germany, ceding two-thirds of mainland France to Hitler as an occupied area, providing 550 million francs per day to the German army for military expenses, and organizing the puppet Vichy government.

　　History proves that the fall of France did not save the fate of the French reactionaries, nor did it give Hitler any real victory. The French Communist Party and the French peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and liberal bourgeoisie gradually organized armed resistance against the German army, and "Maquis" (guerrilla) units sprang up everywhere. On November 25, 1942, the French Communist Party and de Gaulle agreed on a joint anti-German action program. In March 1943, the National Council of Resistance was established, including volunteers and guerrillas from the "Combat" faction and the "Liberation" faction, the National Front, the General Confederation of Labor, the Christian Labor Confederation, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Party, the Popular Republican Movement, the Democratic Alliance, and the Republican Union. On June 3, 1943, Giraud and de Gaulle reached an agreement to establish the Committee of National Liberation in North Africa, which was reorganized in November to include representatives of many parties. On April 4, 1944, the French Communist Party also had two representatives participating in the Liberation Committee.

　　On June 6, 1944, when the Allied forces landed in France, uprisings broke out everywhere in the French interior, attacking the German invaders and Vichy elements. On August 22, the interior forces captured the central district of Paris. On August 24, the Allied forces entered Paris, and France was liberated from then on. Another great achievement was the signing of the Soviet-French Twenty-Year Treaty of Mutual Assistance on December 10, which not only guaranteed that the two countries would fight side by side to eliminate the Nazis in the future, but also became a cornerstone of European peace.

　　After the liberation of France, nationwide local elections were held on April 29 and May 6, 1945. Among the 24 million voters, 80 percent voted. Women, who had never had the right to vote, now had 14 million enjoying the rights of citizens. The French Communist Party was dominant in various regions, winning 25 percent of the vote. In the Paris municipal elections, the French Communist Party ranked first. In the provincial senatorial elections from September 23 to 30, 1945, the French Communist Party won a huge victory with 328 seats. In the constituent assembly representatives of October 22, the French Communist Party received the most votes.

　　On November 21 of the same year, the new provisional government of France was formed, with de Gaulle as chairman and the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement each occupying five ministerial positions. In January 1946, de Gaulle fell from power due to betraying the people's interests, emphasizing military expansion, and engaging in anti-Soviet diplomacy. The Socialist Party's Gouin succeeded him in forming a coalition government, with the General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Thorez, serving as vice-chairman.

　　On October 13, the new constitution was approved by national referendum. Its basic characteristics are guaranteeing the people's freedom and rights, vesting the basic powers of the state in the National Assembly, recognizing the equality of all nationalities in mainland France and its colonies, and abolishing monopolies.

　　The results of the new parliamentary elections on November 5 showed that the French Communist Party won the championship. Precisely because of this, the reactionary forces in France, especially those of de Gaulle, were deeply afraid of the overwhelming victory of the people's forces and tried every means to resist. Blum's rise to power and the Socialist Party's single-party government are products of the struggle between these two forces. (Attached image)

    在历史上，法国曾经历过三次资产阶级民主革命，三次扑灭帝制的复活，才诞生了法兰西共和国。一八七一年底“巴黎公社”，是世界无产阶级，第一次取得政权的辉煌胜利。
    第一次世界大战，他参加协约国，打败了德国，收复普法战争割与德国的领土亚尔萨斯和劳伦，并获得了叙利亚等代管殖民地。
    一九二九年到一九三五年的世界经济恐慌，法国生产减少了三分之一，爆发了轰动世界的一九三四年二月十二日四百五十万人的总罢工，同年七月二十七日法共与社会党签定了统一行动的公约，共同反对法西斯，反对垄断统治法国政治经济的二百家富豪。因而促成了一九三六年法国人民阵线，取得政权的伟大胜利。人民阵线的参加者，除共、社两党外，还有急进党，劳工总同盟，人权同盟共和派前线战士会，人民救济会等。
    第二次世界大战的初期，由于反动财阀们施奈德、温台尔等的勾结希特勒，勃鲁姆等的背叛人民利益，在慕尼黑会议之后，实行疏远苏联，消极备战的政策，法国很快的就沦亡了。在一九四○年六月廿二日，以贝当为首的法国的卖国贼们和德国签订了耻辱的“康边森林协定”，把三分之二的法兰西本土，送与希特勒作占领区，每天供给五万万五千万的法郎给德军作军费。并组织了奴才的维希政府。
    历史证明法国的沦亡并没有解救法国反动分子们的命运，也没有给予希特勒什么真正的胜利。法国共产党和法国的农民，小资产阶级，自由资产阶级逐渐的组织武装反抗德军，“马基”（游击队）到处都在产生。一九四二年十一月廿五日法共和戴高乐商得了共同抗德行动纲领，一九四三年三月成立了全国抗敌委员会，参加的有“战斗”派，“解放”派的义勇军和游击队，民族阵线，劳工总同盟，基督教劳工同盟，共产党，社会党，急进党，人民共和党，民主联盟和共和主义同盟。一九四三年六月三日吉罗德和戴高乐成立协定，在北非成立民族解放委员会，十一月间改组包括了许多党派的代表。一九四四年四月四日，法共也有了两名代表参加解放委员会。
    一九四四年六月六日，当盟军在法登陆的时候，法国内地到处起义，打击德寇和维希分子，八月廿二日，内地军攻下了巴黎中心市区，二十四日盟军进入巴黎，法国从此就光复了。另一个伟大成就是十二月十日苏法二十年互助条约的签订，它不仅保证了以后法苏两国并肩消灭纳粹，而且成了欧洲和平的柱石。
    法国光复之后，在一九四五年四月二十九日和五月六日举行全国各地的地方选举，在二千四百万选民中，投票的占百分之八十，妇女从来没有选举权，现在却有一千四百万人享受公民的权利了。法共在各地都占优势，获得百分之二十五的选票，巴黎市选举中，法共占了第一位。一九四五年九月二十三日到三十日的省参议员选举中，法共又获得了三二八席的巨大胜利，十月二十二日的制宪会议代表中，法共得票最多。
    同年十一月二十一日，法国新临时政府组成，戴高乐任主席，共产党，社会党，人民共和党各占五个部长。一九四六年一月戴高乐因背叛人民利益，强调扩军和反苏外交而垮台，社会党的古恩继组联合政府，法共总书记多列士任副主席。
    十月十三日全国复决通过了新宪法，它的基本特点是保证人民的自由权利，国家基本大权操之于国民议会，承认法国本部与各殖民地的民族一律平等，废除垄断企业。
    十一月五日新国会选举结果，法共荣获冠军，正因为如此，法国的反动势力，特别是戴高乐之辈深怕人民力量的压倒胜利，想尽了各种方法进行反抗，勃鲁姆的登台和社会党的一党政府，就是两种力量斗争中的产物。（附图片）
