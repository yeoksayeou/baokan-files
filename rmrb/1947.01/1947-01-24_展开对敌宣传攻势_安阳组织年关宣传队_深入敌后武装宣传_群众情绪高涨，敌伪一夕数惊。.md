[Changzhi Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] To launch a widespread propaganda offensive against the enemy during the Lunar New Year, and to enable compatriots groaning in the Chiang-occupied areas to be well-informed about the situation of the Motherland's Self-Defense War, the Anyang County Command specifically organized a cultural propaganda team on the 6th of this month to conduct activities deep in the border areas and behind enemy lines. The main contents of the propaganda were to combine with the local atrocities of Chiang and his puppet regime to arouse the masses' fighting spirit, distribute a large number of propaganda materials, widely disseminate the news of our army's victory, and the determination to recover lost territories and liberate compatriots. At the same time, in coordination with the county opera troupe, cyclical performances were carried out in the border areas, publicizing dramas related to the Patriotic Self-Defense War and the liberation of the masses. In terms of current affairs propaganda, the dramatic development of democratic forces in the world and China was emphasized, exposing the rumors and deceptions of Chiang and his puppet regime's secret agents, and strengthening the masses' confidence in victory. Propaganda materials were also distributed to Chiang's puppet strongholds, mainly informing Chiang's military officers and soldiers of the dire consequences of fighting a civil war, and that they should take up arms in righteous uprising to save the motherland and themselves.

[Anyang News from Our Newspaper] On the night of the 6th of this month, all cadres, militiamen, and armed work teams in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 10th districts of Anyang launched a comprehensive armed propaganda campaign in more than ten villages along the Shui-Guan Highway east, and west of the Ping-Han Railway, stretching about forty li east to west. The four districts were unified in command, forming four armed propaganda teams, conducting propaganda in three areas. When our propaganda team was about to leave ×× village, an old lady insisted that we stay there and kill the "Homecoming Corps" for her. In one night, we convened mass meetings in nine villages, distributed more than 900 copies of propaganda materials, posted more than 40 notices, arrested one commander of the puppet village office and one member of the "Homecoming Corps" each, and seven local bullies and landlords. A large number of clothes extorted from the masses by the puppet township office were confiscated and returned to the masses along the way. The next day, the "Homecoming Corps" did not dare to run rampant in the villages we had propagandized all day long. After this activity, many local bullies and landlords automatically came to our government to declare that they would never dare to "settle scores." The personnel of the puppet Sanmin Township Office also moved into the enemy stronghold of Lunzhang and did not dare to extort the masses casually.

[Further News] Our people's militia group in Dongbangzuo, with the tactics of "sparrow warfare, flying all over the sky," suddenly broke into thirty villages behind enemy lines in one night, and distributed a large number of propaganda materials on both sides of the Ping-Han Railway. The Homecoming Corps in various places were alarmed several times in one night.

[Jiaozuo News from Our Newspaper] Recently, our militia armed work teams went deep behind enemy lines and launched a propaganda war. Dozens of kinds of propaganda materials and notices were dropped from the mountains along with the army. Slogans were written in large, eye-catching characters on the walls of the border villages. The masses were extremely happy to see them and said, "The Eighth Route Army will never leave." Everyone carefully saved and hid the Jicha banknotes, waiting for the day of liberation with full confidence. The local bullies and landlords dared not "settle scores," and the traitors wanted to leave a way out for themselves in front of the masses after seeing our notices. The puppet Self-Defense Corps members quit one after another, and the puppet Baolongs did not dare to demand too much grain from the masses arbitrarily; the poor households were not dispatched. The bullet money sent to Xifengfeng was also returned to the masses.

　　展开对敌宣传攻势
    安阳组织年关宣传队
    深入敌后武装宣传
    群众情绪高涨，敌伪一夕数惊。
    【本报长治廿一日电】旧历年关，安阳县指挥部，为对敌广泛展开宣传攻势，并使呻吟于蒋占区之同胞，熟知祖国自卫战争的情形，本月六日特组织一文化宣传队，深入边地及敌后活动。宣传主要内容为结合当地蒋伪暴行，激发群众斗争情绪，散发大批宣传品，普遍传播我军胜利消息，及收复失地解救同胞之决心，同时配合县剧团，在边沿地区进行轮回公演，宣传有关爱国自卫战争及群众翻身之戏剧。时事宣传方面，强调世界及中国民主力量的激剧发展，揭穿蒋伪特务造谣欺骗，坚定群众必胜信心。并向蒋伪据点散发宣传品，主要告知蒋军官兵打内战的没下场，应执戈举义，救祖国救自己。
    【本报安阳讯】安阳二、三、四、十，四个区全体干部民兵武工队，本月六日夜，在水观公路东，平汉线西，东西长约四十余里的十余村庄内，展开全面武装宣传。四个区统一指挥，组成四个武装宣传队，分三个地区进行宣传，××村一老太太当我宣传队要走时，硬要我们住在那里给他打死“还乡团”，一夜我共召开了九个村的群众大会，散发宣传品九百余份，贴布告四十余张，抓获伪村公所指挥员及“还乡团”员各一人，恶霸地主七名，缴获伪乡公所敲诈群众之衣物甚多，均沿途送归群众。第二日整天“还乡团”都未敢到我宣传过的村庄横行。这次活动后，许多恶霸地主自动来找我政府声明，再不敢要“倒算”。伪三民乡公所人员亦搬入敌据点伦掌，不敢随便敲诈群众了。
    【又讯】我东傍佐某民兵集团，以“麻雀战、满天飞”战术，一夜突入敌后三十余村，在平汉铁路两侧大量散发宣传品，各地还乡团一夕数惊。
    （北斗、砚田、保中）
    【本报焦作讯】最近我民兵武工队深入敌后，展开宣传战，数十种宣传品布告，随军飞下山去，标语口号以赫然大字写在边沿村墙壁上，群众见了，异常欢喜，都说：“八路军永远也不会走的。”大家都将冀钞保存藏放起来，充满着信心地在等待解放的日子到来。恶霸地主不敢“倒算”，奸特见了我方布告，也想在群众面前留后路。伪自卫团员都纷纷不干，伪保长们不敢任意向群众多要粮款，穷户就不派。西冯封派的子弹款，也给群众退回了。
