    Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Our Army Deepens Behind Enemy Lines
    Vigorously Develops Guerrilla Warfare
    Holding a Gun in One Hand and Distributing Land in the Other
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] A reporter met a comrade from the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Military Region at the Central Bureau of the Jinji-Luyu Region, who briefly described the land reform situation in the region, where they were holding guns in one hand and distributing land in the other, as well as their experiences. Although the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Military Region is far behind enemy lines, experiencing severe enemy blockades and "encirclements," the entire region resolutely implemented the central government's land reform policy. Not only did it victoriously persist in the patriotic self-defense war, recovering vast lost territories occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, but it also launched guerrilla warfare in the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied areas. It is currently carrying out mass mobilization work of holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other with great enthusiasm. For example, after the second "encirclement" by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the East Water Sub-district last year, only a partial land reform was carried out. More than 40 villages of peasants obtained more than 3,000 mu of land from local bullies and landlords. Therefore, the determination and enthusiasm of the masses to defend their homes and themselves became even higher, laying a solid foundation for defeating Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclements" several times later. This fully proves that land reform can be carried out in guerrilla areas as well. Some cadres believe that "the environment in guerrilla areas is very special, and the masses are afraid to want land," or "they are afraid of offending the landlords and it is difficult to persevere." Facts have proved that these are all wrong. At present, the land reform in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu guerrilla area has gained the following experience: (1) Land reform is closely combined with the patriotic self-defense war. After our army's three victories against the "encirclement," the masses who were afraid of us leaving in the past now turned to believe that we could persevere. People who were timid in the past are now also daring to struggle and demand land. For example, the masses in the original Eighth Sub-district carried out land reform in such a vigorous manner. The landlords there saw that the Eighth Route Army would never leave, so they dared not ask the masses to return the land. The heroic patriotic self-defense war has become a powerful guarantee for mobilizing the masses, and the movement of guerrilla warfare and land reform are closely combined with each other and rapidly developed. Every guerrilla fighter clearly understood that they must hold a gun in one hand and do land reform work in the other. Therefore, as soon as they arrived there, they quickly launched a mass struggle to distribute land. The mass work teams that specialized in land reform were completely transformed into guerrillas or armed work teams to carry out their work. After the land reform in the central areas was completed, the masses were immediately organized and armed to defend the fruits of their liberation. In the peripheral areas, the masses were first mobilized to arm themselves for self-defense, destroy the stubborn puppet regime, and carry out struggles against conscription and resistance to grain and taxes, and then carry out land reform, etc. For example, the land reform work of the masses in the Huaiyin-Luyi area, which was only recently launched, was mainly carried out in this way. When our army started to wage guerrilla warfare, more than 900 young men who had fled to avoid conscription all fled to the area where our army was active. They said: The Chiang Kai-shek regime in Luyi has recently forced the people to pay oil mill tax, inheritance tax, and even the dead have to pay taxes! The people hated them to the bone. A large number of young people automatically joined our army and organized armed forces to assist our army in destroying the stubborn puppet regime. Land reform was carried out in the areas where the stubborn puppet regime had been destroyed. In short, everything should be combined with the war, and the movement can be carried out well. (2) In implementing policies, special attention should be paid to uniting with the middle peasants and protecting the interests of the rich peasants, military families, enlightened landlords, and small and medium landlords (leaving appropriate living conditions). The targets of attack are only big landlords and big traitors, so as to win over the majority, isolate the minority, and facilitate the development of guerrilla warfare. (3) We must follow the mass line and strictly prohibit coercion and commandism; otherwise, we will not be able to achieve the purpose of mobilizing the masses, but will alienate ourselves from the masses.

    豫皖苏我军深入敌后
    大力开展游击战争
    一手持枪一手分田
    【本报特讯】记者在晋冀鲁豫中央局会见刚从豫皖苏军区抵此的某同志，承其简述该区一手持枪、一手分田的土地改革情形及其经验如下：豫皖苏军区虽远处敌后，经历着敌人的严重封锁与“围剿”，但全区仍坚决执行了中央土地改革政策，不但胜利的坚持了爱国自卫战争，收复了被蒋军侵占的广大失地，在蒋军侵陷地区展开了游击战争，并正火热朝天的进行着一手持枪一手分田的群众发动工作。如水东分区在去年蒋军二次“围剿”后，只局部进行了土地改革，四十余村农民从恶霸地主手里取得了土地三千多亩，因此群众保家自卫的决心和热情便更加高涨，奠下了以后数次打垮蒋军“围剿”的有力基础。这完全证明了游击区是可以同样进行土地改革的。有些干部认为：“游击区环境很特殊，群众不敢要土地。”或者“怕得罪地主，不好坚持。”事实证明这都是不对的。目前，豫皖苏游击区土地改革已获如下经验：（一）土地改革与爱国自卫战争密切结合。我军三次反“围剿”胜利后，过去怕我们离开的群众。此时即转而相信我们能坚持，过去表现畏缩的人们现在也敢于斗争和要地了。如原八分区群众，就这样轰轰烈烈的进行了土地改革；那里的地主看到八路军永远不会走了，也就不敢向群众要还土地了。英勇的爱国自卫战争成了发动群众的有力保障，一面游击、一面土地改革的运动，便互相密切结合着，迅速开展起来。每个游击队员，都明确了自己必须一手持枪一手做土地改革的工作；因此，他们一到那里，就迅速发动分田的群众斗争；而专门进行土地改革的群众工作队，也就完全变成游击队或武工队去进行工作。中心地区土地改革完成后，便即刻组织群众武装，保卫自己翻身果实。边沿区则首先发动群众武装自卫，摧毁顽伪政权，进行反抓丁及抗粮抗税等斗争，然后接着进行土地改革等。如最近才开展的淮阴鹿邑地区群众土地改革工作，主要就是这样开展起来的。当我军开始去游击时，逃避抓丁的九百多壮丁，都逃到我军活动区域来。他们说：鹿邑蒋政权最近已强迫老百姓出油磨税、遗产税、连死人也要出税呵！老百姓恨之入骨，大批青壮年自动参加我军，并组织武装，协助我军摧毁顽伪政权。在顽伪政权已摧垮地区，进行起土地改革来。总之，一切都应与战争相结合，运动才能很好的开展。（二）在执行政策中，要特别注意团结中农，保护富农、军属、开明地主、中小地主的利益（留适当生活），打击对象只是大地主大汉奸，这样才能争取多数，孤立少数，便利于开展游击战争。（三）必须走群众路线，严禁强迫命令，否则既不能达到发动群众目的，反使自己脱离群众。（泽然）
