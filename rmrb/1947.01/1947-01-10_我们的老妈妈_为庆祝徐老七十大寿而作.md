"Our Old Mother"
Written in Celebration of Xu Lao's Seventieth Birthday
Mei Cun

From 1941 to 1942, I studied at the Academy of Natural Sciences, and I was one of those personally nurtured by Xu Lao. I know something about his situation at that time, and now, to celebrate his seventieth birthday, I have written this article based on my memories.

I. "Our Old Mother."

In the spring of 1941, Comrade Xu Teli came to the Academy of Natural Sciences as president. We welcomed him with large slogans everywhere: "Welcome our Old Mother – Xu Lao!" He was kind and amiable, and as soon as you approached him, you felt incredibly warm and dear, like a child in the embrace of a loving mother. He cared for and loved everyone. He often went to the classes to understand the students' living conditions and learning progress. When everyone was eating, he often went to the dining hall to see if the rice was cooked properly and if the dishes were well prepared. Every time he met someone, he warmly took their hand and asked if they were well, if their studies were progressing, and if they had any difficulties. When he heard that someone was sick, he would run to see them several times a day, put his hand on their forehead, and comfort them kindly. He often talked with cadres and students, comforting and encouraging them. For those who were feeling down, he patiently talked to them again and again. For those who made mistakes, he criticized them sternly, pointed out their errors, and then earnestly comforted and encouraged them. Therefore, every comrade also loved and respected him. Everyone would talk to him. His room was often crowded with people. Students would run to him as soon as they saw him, taking his hand and affectionately calling him "Xu Lao." His little orderly was not at all restrained with him, calling him "Xu Lao" this and "Xu Lao" that. Children are playful, and once they start playing, they forget their work. Xu Lao often took water buckets and personally ran down the mountain to the kitchen to fetch water. For the shortcomings of the "little devils," he did not rebuke them, but patiently influenced and persuaded them. His care for the "little devils" was even more meticulous. His "little devil" lived in the kiln next to him and wet the bed every night. During the day, he often forgot to dry the bedding. So, Xu Lao personally dried it for him.

II. Working Tirelessly Forever

Xu Lao's spirit of hard work often inspired us to be more encouraged. From morning till night, he was never willing to rest for a moment. He said, "Resting is the greatest distress." He cared about everything. He constantly went deep into all parts of the school to study the situation and solve problems. Because the Academy of Natural Sciences was very scattered, he was constantly running from the mountain to the foot of the mountain, and from the foot of the mountain to the mountain. Several times, I saw him climbing from the foot of the mountain to the mountain, sweating and panting, taking off his cotton-padded coat and walking only in his shirt. When he couldn't walk, he would sit on the grass by the roadside to rest. Once, he was sick and had diarrhea several times a day, and he couldn't eat, but he didn't tell anyone and continued to work as usual. One morning, after having diarrhea, his stomach ached, and he fell on the grass next to the toilet without uttering a sound, fearing to disturb others. Later, he was discovered by Comrade Wei Zhi, the head of the cadre department, who carried him back to his room. After feeling a little better, he went back to his usual intense work.

III. Live and Learn

He is a famous old educator both in China and abroad, and a knowledgeable scholar, proficient in social sciences, philosophy, political economics, natural sciences... However, he is not satisfied with these and is always studying "tirelessly." His spirit of learning is unmatched by most people. From morning to night, he is either working or studying, learning whenever he has time, never letting it go to waste. He can be seen reading very early in the morning. He stays up late at night, still reading with a dim vegetable oil lamp, wearing his reading glasses. He reads very carefully. He reads the important parts repeatedly, circles them, dots them, underlines them, and adds notes. I once flipped through a hardback copy of his *History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union*, which was filled with black circles and notes added with a brush. He often encouraged us to study hard, saying: A person must learn as long as they live, and learn everything thoroughly, not be satisfied with a smattering of knowledge. He emphasized learning for practical use, integrating teaching, learning, and doing. He admired Mr. Tao Xingzhi's educational philosophy very much and often regarded himself as Mr. Tao's student. His humble attitude towards learning often made me feel ashamed. He often discussed physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics with teachers or students in the academy. Because he studied in this way, he learned everything very quickly. According to him, he was in his forties when he started learning mathematics, and by 1941, his mastery of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry had convinced many experts.

IV. The Best Teacher

At that time, he taught us *History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union*, and the combination of theory and practice was very close. To explain a theory, he often cited many vivid facts to make the problem particularly clear. He had participated in the Work-Study Movement in Europe and engaged in the workers' movement for many years. He had an amazing amount of practical struggle knowledge in China for decades. He often told us stories of the workers' movement in France, Germany, and the Soviet Union. His teaching language and actions were lively and vivid, and his voice was very loud. When he was excited, he often suddenly jumped up from the stool and made various dramatic movements to illustrate the content and attract the attention of the listeners. He spoke in such a way that people listened intently, and everyone loved to listen to his lectures. Often after class, students would surround him, asking this and that. He patiently answered every question raised by everyone. Finally, he would ask about everyone's understanding. As for soliciting everyone's opinions on his lectures, it was even more frequent.

V. A Model of Hard Struggle

Although he was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the president of the school, he did not even want a bodyguard. When he first arrived at the school, he had one person and one "little devil." Later, he proposed to share one with other comrades in the academy. Everyone disagreed, unanimously believing that he had a lot of work and was getting old, and it would be more convenient to use a "little devil" alone. He repeatedly explained and persuaded, and finally, he shared one with everyone. He never paid attention to his personal life. Hard work, simplicity, and thrift were his consistent characteristics. The cotton coat from 1940 was washed and worn again in 1941. The government gave him a new set of clothes to take care of him, but he didn't want them and donated them to the government to support the front line of the War of Resistance Against Japan. He also didn't want an overcoat and hadn't seen him wear an overcoat for two winters. He often wore coarse cloth clothes, and most of them were old. In the summer, he didn't buy a straw hat and wore a tattered straw hat. Everyone advised him to start a small stove separately, but he resolutely opposed it. As a result, everyone obeyed his opinion, and he ate the same medium-sized meals with the general technicians. The cave he lived in was the most simple. Except for some material boxes, book boxes, a single desk, and a few stools, there were no other decorations. The bedding was not as lavish as that of the average student. His horse was given to the public for use, and he was rarely seen riding it. The Academy of Sciences was more than ten miles away from Yangjialing, and he often walked back and forth.

In 1942, Xu Lao's sixty-sixth birthday, the Academy of Sciences held a grand celebration. At the conference, he humbly and happily expressed his wish: "I feel that my contribution to the revolution is very small, and I hope to live another twenty years and do more work for the Party..." His wish is also the wish of millions of us. We wish him "boundless longevity!"

    “我们的老妈妈”
    为庆祝徐老七十大寿而作
    梅村
    一九四一年至四二年，我在自然科学院学习，是徐老亲自培育下的一个。对于他当时的情形，知道一些，现为庆祝他的七十大寿，特就记忆所及，写成此篇。
  一、“我们的老妈妈”。
    四一年春天，徐特立同志到自然科学研究院当院长。我们欢迎他，到处贴着大标语：“欢迎我们的老妈妈——徐老！”他慈祥、和蔼，一走近他，就感到无比的温暖，可亲，像小孩子到了慈母的怀抱一样。他对任何人，都关心，爱护。经常到班上去，了解同学们的生活情形与学习情况。当大家吃饭的时候，他还常到饭堂里，看看饭做的生不生？菜炒的好不好？每遇见一个人，就亲热地拉住他的手，问他身体好不好？学习进步没有？有什么困难？听到那个人病了，一天跑去看几次，把手放在他额头上，亲切地安慰他。经常找干部、学员谈话。安慰他，鼓励他。对于思想上想不开的人，耐心地，一次一次找他谈。对于犯错误的人，很严正的批评他，指出他的错误，然后，又恳切地安慰他，鼓励他。因此每一个同志也都热爱他，尊敬他。有什么话都和他谈。他的屋里，经常挤满了人”。同学们一见他就跑去拉住他的手，亲切地呼着“徐老”。他的小勤务员，对他一点也不拘束，“徐老”长“徐老”短的称呼他。小孩子贪玩，一玩起来，就忘记工作了。徐老就时常拿着水桶，亲自跑到山下火房打水。对于“小鬼”的缺点，他不是斥责，而是耐心地感化他，说服他。对“小鬼”的关心，更是无微不至。他的“小鬼”，住在他旁边的窑里，每天夜里尿床。到白天，自己又经常忘记晒。于是，徐老就亲自替他晒。
  二、永远不疲倦的工作着
    徐老艰苦工作的精神，常使我们因受感动而更加鼓舞起来。一天到晚，一刻也不肯休息，他说：“休息着是最大的苦恼。”什么事情，他都关心。不断深入到学校的各部分去研究情况，解决问题。因自然科学院住的很分散，他每天，不停地从山上跑到山下，从山下跑到山上，有几次，看见他从山下往山上爬，流着汗，喘着气，把棉袄脱掉，光穿着衬衣，走不动时，就坐在路边的草地上休息。有一次，他病了，泻肚子，一天泻几回，饭也吃不下去，但他没对任何人说，仍照常坚持工作。一天上午，他泻肚后，肚疼起来，倒在厕所旁边的草地上，不哼一声，害怕惊扰别人，后来，被干部处长卫之同志发觉了，才把他背回房里。稍微轻了些，他就又照常紧张的工作了。
  三、做到老学到老
    他是中外驰名的老教育家，又是知识渊博的学者，社会科学、哲学、政治经济学、自然科学……都是很精通的。但是，他毫不以这些为满足，永远“孜孜不倦”地学习着。他的学习精神，是一般人都赶不上的。从早到晚，除了工作就是学习，有空就学，一刻也不让它空过去。早晨很早就见他在那里读书。晚上深夜不睡，还点着一盏豆大的菜油灯，戴着老花眼镜读书。他读书，十分细心。重要的地方反复读好多遍，还在一旁圈上圈，点上点，画上杠，加上批。我曾翻过他的一本洋装《联共党史》，上面画满了黑圈圈，和用毛笔加的批。他常勉励我们发奋学习，他说：一个人，要做到老学到老，学什么要彻底，不要满足于一知半解。他最强调学以致用，教学做三位一体。他对于陶行知先生的教育思想非常崇拜，常以陶先生的学生自居。他学习态度的虚心，使我常感到惭愧。他时常和院内的教员或学生研究物理、化学、生物和数学。正因为他是这样学习的，学什么都学的特别快。据他说他是四十几岁才开始学数学的，到四一年时，他对代数、几何、三角的精通，使许多专家心悦诚服。
  四、最好的先生
    当时，他给我们讲《联共党史》，理论与实际结合的最紧密。为了说明一条理论，常举出许多活生生的事实，把问题说的特别透彻。他曾在欧洲参加勤工俭学会，进行工人运动多年，在国内更是斗争了几十年。他的实际斗争知识惊人的多。他常给我们讲法国、德国、苏联的工人运动故事。他讲课的语言、动作，生动活泼，声音很宏亮，当讲到兴奋的时候，常突然从凳子上跳起来，作出各种戏剧性的动作，以说明内容，引起听者注意。讲的使人听起来入神，谁都爱听他的课。往往下课后，同学们还围着他，问这问那。他就耐心地给大家解答提出的每一个问题。最后，还要询问大家接受的情形。至于征求大家对他讲课的意见，更是经常的。
  五、艰苦奋斗的模范
    他虽身为中共中委，又是学校的院长，连个警卫员也不要。才到学校时，他一个人一个“小鬼”。后来，他提出和院部其他同志共用一个。大家都不同意，一致认为他工作多，又上年纪了，单独用一个“小鬼”方便一些。他再三解释说服，最后，还是和大家共用一个。他私人的生活从不讲究。刻苦、简朴、节衣缩食，是他一贯的特点。四○年的棉衣，到四一年又拆洗了穿。公家为了照顾他，发给他一套新的，他不要，又捐给公家，支援抗日战争的前线了。他也不要大衣，两个冬天没见他穿过大衣。经常穿着粗布衣裳，而且多是旧的。夏天，也不买顶草帽，戴着一顶破草帽。大家劝他单独起个小灶，他坚决反对，结果，大家服从了他的意见，他就和一般技术人员同吃中灶饭。他住的窑洞，最为简陋。除一些材料箱、书箱和办公用的一张单桌，几个凳子外，没有其它摆设。床铺还没有一般同学阔气。他的马，交给公家用，很少见他骑过马。科学院离杨家岭有十几里地，他时常步行跑来跑去。
    四二年，徐老六十六大寿，科学院开大会庆祝。在大会上，他谦逊而愉快的说出他的愿望：“我感觉自己给革命的贡献很少，希望再活二十年，多给党作些工作…………。”他的愿望也是我们千百万人的愿望。我们祝他“万寿无疆！”
