[This report from our correspondent in Weixian, dated the 29th] In the consolidation phase of the mass movement in Jinnan, ideological education is being carried out. In various villages, the masses are engaging in "comparison of merits" and spontaneously requesting the election of model workers. In Ding Cao, Ningnan, during the "comparison of merits," the masses believe that the greatest merit belongs to Chairman Mao and cadres at all levels; the second greatest merit belongs to the Eighth Route Army; and the third greatest merit belongs to active elements. Some of the masses feel that the active elements work hard for everyone, and they need to be elected and given spiritual rewards. The leadership, therefore, in accordance with the demands of the masses, promoted this movement. The method of election is to first have specific discussions in small groups, and then report to large groups or the general assembly. The criteria for model workers can be debated by everyone, and the individuals themselves can also participate and offer their opinions, which are then determined with the agreement of all members. Before electing model workers, each village conducts thorough deliberation. In Dongwang and Nan Ding Cao, conditions were put forward by the small groups, and then they were automatically made into clappers, songs, and blackboard bulletins to cooperate with the commendation. Some villages also organized propaganda teams to go deep into various streets and households to publicize the events. After the election, grand celebrations were held, and Yangge teams from surrounding villages and farmer's associations were invited to participate, which was a very good education for all members and model workers. The celebration method in Dongwang Town was to have the elected small group model workers, large group model workers, town model workers, good members, and model families stand up separately and be welcomed with applause. In addition, model plaques were made. Nan Ding Cao took photos of the model workers, presented flowers, and performed Yangge. Through these celebration methods, the masses had a very clear distinction between good and bad. Experience has proven that through the "movement to elect model workers," the masses are encouraged to learn from each other and observe each other, so that the enthusiasm of the masses remains high and does not cool down after a surge. After the election of model workers in Dongwang and Nan Ding Cao, there has been significant progress in the work, especially among the model workers themselves, who are working even more vigorously. The village completed the task of handing in public grain, more than 2,000 households, in three days, and winter studies are also very active.
