[This dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu area via our newspaper on the 20th] The fourth district of Tai-Xi mobilized land reform heroes to lead the land reform, opening up the situation in three villages in four days. In the western part of the fourth district, although farmers in fifteen villages had previously engaged in struggles such as land redemption and anti-local tyrant movements, they had not completely turned themselves around. In order to quickly and thoroughly realize "land to the tiller," the district committee mobilized more than 20 land reform heroes to participate in the land reform work team. On December 11th of last year, the land reform heroes gathered at Guanwang Temple to study the work, and each group launched a competition, with everyone going deep into the villages. Two days later, the first shot was fired in Guanwang Temple. Xuanle was also opened on the third day, and Xiqiao ended the struggle on the fourth day. The masses gained more than 60 mu of land, and everyone was full of smiles. Now the entire district is "lighting fires" everywhere, universally launching the movement.

　　泰西组织翻身英雄领导运动
    四区四天打开三个村
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】泰西四区动员翻身英雄领导土地改革，四天打开三个庄的局面。四区西半部十五个村的农民过去虽进行过赎地反恶霸等斗争，但没有彻底的翻过身。区分委会为了很快的彻底实现耕者有其田，即动员二十多位翻身英雄参加翻身工作队。去年十二月十一日，翻身英雄齐集关王庙，研究工作，各组发动竞赛，大家深入到村里。两天后，在关王庙首先开了第一炮，第三天玄乐也打开了，第四天徐桥即结束了斗争，群众获得土地六十多亩，大家无不笑容满面。现全区正到处“点火”，普遍开展运动。
