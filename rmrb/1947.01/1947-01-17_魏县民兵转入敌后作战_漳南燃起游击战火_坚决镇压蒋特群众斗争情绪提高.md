[Report from this newspaper, Weixian, 15th] Guerrilla fires have spread extensively along the south bank of the Zhang River, becoming a huge obstacle to the northward advance of Chiang's army. Before the Chiang army invaded Chuwang and Huilong, Wei County made full preparations for war. The militia underwent universal vows and was reorganized into two detachments, Zhangnan and Zhangbei. Since the enemy invaded and occupied Chuwang and Huilong on November 30, the county's elite militia immediately gathered to persist in the struggle behind enemy lines. They organized elite sharpshooter teams, sniper teams, and explosion teams. Some attacked the head, some attacked the tail, and some moved to the enemy's flanks, making it impossible for the enemy to attend to both the head and tail, or the east and west. As a result, they killed and wounded more than 40 enemy soldiers, and the militia safely transferred. Militia guerrilla corps, led by district cadres, harassed the enemy every night. At the same time, they carried out political work, combined with the masses, entered villages without enemies to hold meetings, understood the village situation, exchanged struggle experience, provided timely intelligence within the village, and cooperated internally and externally. They also explained government laws to landlords, stating that as long as they do not help the Chiang army do bad things, the government will absolutely guarantee the safety of their lives and property. Individual bad guys were resolutely arrested, and the suppression of special agent activities greatly increased the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle. In villages near strongholds, they organized armed forces, combined with open armed forces, and persisted in the struggle against the "Homecoming Corps" and bad guys in the villages. Village militias also returned to their villages to cooperate with village self-defense forces to stand guard and patrol, persisting in the struggle to protect their homes and land. According to the voluntary will of the masses, they combined to organize joint defense. If something happened in one village, all villages would take action. Combined with small groups of elite militia, they blockaded the enemy and fought sparrow warfare, sniping warfare, and explosion warfare to protect the interests of the masses and close the relationship between the masses. Currently, a mass-based guerrilla war is spreading throughout the county.
