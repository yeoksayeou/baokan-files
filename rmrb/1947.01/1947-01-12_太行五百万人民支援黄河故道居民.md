　　[This Dispatch from Changzhi, 10th] The news that Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique insisted on closing the Yellow River and releasing water before and after the New Year, flooding the Liberated Areas, has aroused great indignation in all circles here. The Taihang District General Labor Union, General Farmers' Association, Youth League, Women's Federation, Literary Federation, and Armed Forces Committee and other mass organizations issued a circular telegram the other day, stating: "We are determined to mobilize five million people in the entire district to support the seven million people along the river in the Jilu-Yu Liberated Area with armed forces and material strength to oppose the towering crimes of Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialists." The announcement warned Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique, stating: You treat the people with behavior worse than Jie and Zhou, and the people will inevitably oppose you with behavior even more intense than opposing Jie and Zhou. The telegram agreed with the proposal of Director Wang of our Yellow River Commission to postpone the closing and water release until the summer of next year. The telegram finally expressed support for the seven million people along the river, stating: The Liberated Areas are one family, and we will definitely support you with all our strength, you are not isolated.

　　太行五百万人民支援黄河故道居民
    【本报长治十日电】蒋介石反动集团对黄河归故，坚持于新年前后合龙放水，水淹解放区的消息传到后，此间各界均极愤慨。太行区总工会、总农会、青联、妇联、文联及武委会等群众团体于日前发表通电称：“我们决发动全区五百万人民，以武装力量物质力量支援冀鲁豫解放区沿河七百万人民，反对蒋介石和美帝国主义者滔天罪行。”通告中警告蒋介石反动集团称：你们以比桀纣更坏的行为对待人民，人民亦必以反对桀纣更烈的行为反对你们。通电赞同我黄委会王主任主张，延至明年夏季合龙放水。通电最后声援沿河七百万人民称：解放区是一家，我们绝以全力支援你们，你们不是孤立的。
