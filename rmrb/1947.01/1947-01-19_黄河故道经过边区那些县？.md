　　Which Border Region Counties Does the Old Course of the Yellow River Pass Through?

　　While Chiang Kai-shek is actively blocking the river in Huayuan, he is simultaneously diverting the Yellow River into its old course. As the turbulent flow looms, threatening to harm seven million people, we provide a brief introduction to clarify the situation of the old course of the Yellow River for everyone.

　　The old course of the Yellow River enters our liberated area from near Yantan Village, northwest of Kaocheng. It passes through 23 counties: Kaocheng, Fengqiu, Hua County, Changyuan, Dongming, Heze, Puyang, Pu County, Juancheng, Guancheng, Fan County, Shou Zhang, Yuncheng, Dongping, Dong'a, Pingyin, Changqing, Qihe, and the newly established Dongyuan, Nanhua, Linze, Kunwu, and Zhangqiu, before flowing into the Shandong Military Region and entering the sea at Lijin. The river channel is over 400 kilometers long. Since the Yellow River changed its course in 1938, the riverbed has risen 10 to 17 meters above the general ground level due to wind and sand accumulation. In the past eight years, residents of the original river channels have returned to cultivate the land. Within the Hebei-Luyu area alone, 1,016 new villages have been built on the river channel, with a population of over 360,000. Currently, most of the riverbed has been transformed into fertile farmland, and afforestation has flourished. However, now the river channel and the people along the river are about to face the great disaster of "being fifty years old and not knowing where home is."

　　黄河故道经过边区那些县？
    蒋介石一面在花园积极堵口，一面把黄水引入故道，眼看浊流滔滔而来，七百万人民将要受害，为使大家了解黄河故道是个啥情形，特作简单介绍。
    黄河故道是自考城西北阎潭村附近进入我解放区的。中间经过考城、封邱、滑县、长垣、东明、荷泽、濮阳、濮县、鄄城、观城、范县、寿张、郓城、东平、东阿、平阴、长清、齐河及新设的东垣、南华、临泽、昆吾、张秋等二十三个县，流入山东军区，在利津入海。河身全长四百多公里。自民国二十七年黄河改道以来，经过风吹沙积，日前故道河身已高出一般地面十至十七公尺。八年来，原有河道居民纷纷回家开垦，仅冀鲁豫区内河道上，即新建村达一千零十六个，居民达三十六万之多。目前河床大部已变为良田，植树亦已蔚然成林了。可是现在河道及沿河人民，却又将遭到“年长五十岁，不知家何处”的大灾害了。
