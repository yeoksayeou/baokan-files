    Current Situation on the Jilu Yu Battlefield

    [Dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front, January 5th] Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Pu commented on the situation on the Jilu Yu battlefield, stating: The month-long lull on the Jilu Yu battlefield has been broken, entering a more delicate phase, with the initiative shifting even more towards the People's Liberation Army. The capture of Juye and Jiaxiang, the liberation of Liaocheng, and the control of the four passes of Jinxiang by General Liu Bocheng's forces all on New Year's Day mark a new milestone in the development of the battle situation on this battlefield. Although the Kuomintang (KMT) forces have also occupied the three cities of Daming, Guancheng, and Linzhang (note: Linzhang has been recovered) in the past three days, the one-sided invasion and occupation of cities by the KMT forces since their offensive against Jilu Yu has become a thing of the past. What they have lost in the past few days far outweighs what they have gained. Moreover, the occupied cities are all empty, and they have suffered over 600 casualties under the obstruction of the People's Liberation Army along the way. Furthermore, after the occupation, they have to divide their forces to garrison, which rigidifies a part of their mobile main force into defense, thus weakening their mobile offensive capability. General Liu Bocheng's forces have developed from a large-scale annihilation of the KMT's active forces to simultaneously recovering lost cities. In December of last year, the People's Liberation Army also successively recovered three cities, including Juancheng, Yuncheng, and Puyang. However, these were all due to the KMT forces being forced to withdraw due to perceived threats, and the main force did not suffer significant losses. This time, the cities were captured through strong attacks. Especially in the Battle of Juye, more than 4,500 KMT soldiers were killed or captured, and the results were particularly brilliant. Not a single soldier of the city's garrison and personnel of several puppet county governments of Juye, Juancheng, and Yuncheng escaped. In the attack on the four passes of Jinxiang, the 63rd Regiment of Fang Xianjue's division was annihilated. Fang Xianjue urgently dispatched a brigade for reinforcement. According to news today (the 4th), when they advanced to 20 li south of the city, they discovered that the People's Liberation Army was waiting in full battle array and immediately fled in panic, abandoning their isolated forces besieged in the city, regardless of their fate. Now, the 21st Brigade headquarters and the entire 61st Regiment of Fang Xianjue's division in the city have become turtles in a jar and will soon be completely annihilated. When the KMT forces occupied Juye last October, the 5th Army and the 11th Division lost more than 6,000 elite troops between Dingtao and Juye. After three months of operation, it eventually returned to the hands of the People's Liberation Army, and they had to pay the price of more than 4,000 people again. Last night and the night before, the reporter specifically listened to the KMT's Chongqing broadcast. On the evening of the 2nd, it said that the Juye battle situation was trending towards stability. On the evening of the 3rd, it said that in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they were "transferring positions," which made the reporter burst out laughing. The troops annihilated in the Battle of Juye this time were the miscellaneous puppet troops of Zhang Lanfeng's division. Chiang Kai-shek does not count them in his "unnecessary sacrifice" account. Then, does Chiang Kai-shek count the past 5th Army, the 11th Division, and Fang Xianjue's division in Jinxiang this time? As for the victory in Liaocheng this time, it has relieved the People's Liberation Army of its worries in the rear, the scope of maneuverability is greater, and the freedom of movement is more significant; the puppet army Wang Jinxiang had entrenched himself for several years, was incorporated by Chiang Kai-shek, and stubbornly refused to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. The city walls were extremely strong. This time, they were breached with American-style heavy artillery. The People's Liberation Army did not have this kind of heavy artillery in the past, but it was sent by Chiang Kai-shek in the second half of last year. The People's Liberation Army is becoming stronger and stronger, which can also be seen from this.

    冀鲁豫战场目前形势
    李普
    【本报冀鲁豫前线五日电】新华社记者李普评论冀鲁豫战场之形势称：冀鲁豫战场一个月来沉寂之局面，业已打破，进入更加微妙之阶段，主动权已更大的转入于人民解放军之手。刘伯承将军所部于元旦一天之内，克复钜野、嘉祥，解放聊城，并控制金乡四关，此乃本战场战局发展之新的标帜。蒋军三日来虽亦占大名、观城、临漳（按：临漳已收复）三城，但蒋军进攻冀鲁豫以来单方面侵占城市之局已成过去，其数日来所失者已远较所得者为多，且侵占者均为空城，并在解放军沿途阻击之下损失六百余人，而且其侵占之后更须分兵把守，使其一部分机动之主力僵化为守备，因而机动进攻能力日益削弱，刘伯承将军所部则由大量消灭蒋军有生力量发展至开始同时收复失去之城市。去年十二月间，人民解放军亦曾先后收复鄄城、郓城、濮县等三城，但均系蒋军因感受威胁而不得不被迫退出，主力并无重大损失，此次各城则系经强有力之攻击所克复，特别是钜野一战，毙俘蒋军四千五百余人，战果尤为辉煌，城内守军及钜野、鄄城、郓城等几个伪县政府人员无一生逃。金乡四关之攻击战，歼灭方先觉部六十三团，方先觉急调一个旅增援，据今日（四日）消息，彼等进至城南二十里处，发现人民军正严阵以待，立即望风而逃，弃其被围于城内之孤军于不顾，现城内方先觉部二十一旅旅部与六十一团全团已成瓮中之鳖，即将被全部歼灭。当去年十月间蒋军进占钜野时，在定曹钜野之间，第五军与十一师损失精锐六千人以上，经营三个月后，终归于解放军之手，又不得不付出四千余人之代价。记者昨前两晚特收听蒋方重庆广播，二日晚间谓钜野战局已趋稳定，三日晚间则谓为避免无谓牺牲“转移阵地”，使记者不禁失声大笑。此次钜野一战被歼者为杂牌伪军张岚峰部，蒋介石并不算在他“无谓牺牲”的账上，那么过去的第五军、第十一师以及此次金乡的方先觉部，蒋介石算不算呢？至于此次聊城之捷，解除了人民军后顾之忧，回旋之范围更大，机动之自由更多，意义极为重要；伪军王金祥盘据数年之久，由蒋介石收编而坚不向人民解放军投降，城墙极其坚固，此次系用美式重炮所轰开，解放军过去并无此种重炮，而是蒋介石去年下半年所送来的，解放军之愈战愈强，于此亦可见之。
