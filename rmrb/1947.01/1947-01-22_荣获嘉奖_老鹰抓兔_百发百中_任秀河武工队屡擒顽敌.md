　　Awarded Commendation
    "Eagle Catches Rabbit" Infallible
    Ren Xiuhe's Armed Work Team Repeatedly Captures Stubborn Enemies
    [Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo News] The Jiaozuo City Command issued a circular on the 6th of this month commending Zuo Xiuhe and his armed work team, calling on all levels of cadres in the city to learn from them, and awarded a bonus of 10,000 yuan. It stated briefly: Since Comrade Ren Xiuhe came to work in the urban area on November 8th of the year before last, he has led the armed work team deep behind enemy lines, using the "Eagle Catches Rabbit" tactic to capture, attack, and ambush the enemy everywhere, winning repeatedly, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly a platoon of enemies, while suffering no losses himself. In the Jiaokou battle, Comrade Ren single-handedly captured five enemies, obtaining two native-made guns and twenty grenades. His armed work team launched attacks on Tianjian and Shangbaizuo, which were held by the enemy, for two consecutive nights in late December of last year, capturing seven enemies and obtaining two guns. Then, on the night of the 2nd of this month, on the Jiaozuo-Lifeng highway, they captured four enemy regulars from the Third Brigade, Eighth Regiment, including a platoon leader and a clerk, at the cost of a few grenades. Last November, after the higher authorities called for strengthening political offensives to coordinate with military activities, Comrade Ren and his armed work team took the lead in setting an example, severely打击打击 the enemy and puppet's arrogant attempts to seize grain and "reverse the reckoning," protecting the interests of the masses. This has brought the Jiaozuo guerrilla war into a new situation more favorable to us. (Wang Ruzhen, Jing Chun)

    “老鹰抓兔”百发百中
    任秀河武工队屡擒顽敌
    【本报焦作讯】焦作市指挥部本月六日通令嘉奖作秀河及其武工队，号召全市各级干部向他们学习；并授奖金万元。略称：自前年十一月八日任秀河同志到市区工作后，即带领武工队深入敌后，以“老鹰抓兔”战术，到处捕捉、袭击、伏击敌人，屡战屡胜，毙、伤、俘敌近排，自己却毫无损失。如交口战斗，任同志只身捕敌五人，得土枪两支，手榴弹廿枚。其武工队于去年十二月下旬，连续两夜出击田涧、上白作敌人，捉敌七名，得枪两支后，复于本月二日夜，在焦（作）李（封）汽路上，以几颗手榴弹代价，生俘敌正规军三旅八团排长、文书以下四名。去年十一月，上级号召加强政攻以配合军事活动后，任同志及其武工队首先创范例，严重的打击了敌伪抢粮、“倒算”等狂妄企图，保卫了群众利益。使焦作游击战争进入更加有利于我的新局面。（王汝珍、景春）
