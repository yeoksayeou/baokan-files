Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st - "The possibility of a third party appearing on the American political stage has been raised." This is what an Associated Press reporter said when reporting on the establishment of a new political action group in the United States. This new group, named "Progressive Citizens of America," was founded in New York on New Year's Eve, 1946, led by Wallace. The founding conference included 300 representatives from 14 groups from 21 states, and these groups joined progressive organizations such as the National Citizens Political Action Committee and the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions. Wallace gave a speech at the meeting stating, "Progressives demand a genuine two-party system, not a deceptive one-party system disguised as a two-party group." Wallace did not explicitly state whether he advocated a two-party system of the Democratic and Republican parties, or the establishment of a third party and a two-party system with another party, but a resolution unanimously passed at the meeting stated: "The meeting cannot prohibit the establishment of such a new party, namely a new party whose allegiance to our goals can be relied upon."

　　美国政治舞台上可能出现第三党
    【新华社延安一日电】“美国政治舞台上出现第三党的可能已经提出来了”。这是美联社记者报导美国一方新的政治行动团体成立时所说的。这一新团体名为“美国进步公民”，于一九四六年除夕由华莱士领衔成立于纽约。该成立大会包括来自二十一州代表十四个团体的三百名代表，这些团体加入全国公民政治行动委员会、艺术科学职业独立公民委员会等进步组织。华莱士于会上讲演称：“进步人士要求一个真正的两党制国家，而不是一个在两党集团伪装下之骗人的一党制度。”华氏未明确宣示其所主张者是民主党共和党的两党制抑创立第三党与其他一党的两党制，但会议上一致通过之决议内称：“会议不能禁止成立这样的新政党，即此新政党对于我们目标的效忠是可以依赖的。”
