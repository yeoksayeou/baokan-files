    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st: In the Yancheng-Funing and Huaihai areas of northern Jiangsu, the New Fourth Army's local corps, in combination with the militia, have launched extensive guerrilla warfare. The Chiang Kai-shek troops are only able to hold onto a few county towns. At present, vast areas north of the Sheyang River and south of the silted Yellow River, including central towns such as Yilin and Dongkan, and thousands of villages, are still under the administration of the democratic government. A unit of the 25th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army that invaded Funing once sneaked into Dongkan on New Year's Day, but was severely attacked by the Yancheng-Funing local troops, suffering a loss of more than 70 infantry and cavalrymen in one encounter (the New Fourth Army lost only one soldier); all the special agent pawns sent by the Chiang Kai-shek army were captured alive, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Dongkan were forced to withdraw on the 3rd. The Chiang Kai-shek troops occupying Lianshui City can only operate within a small circle five or six li from the city. The militia around the city launched seven attacks within the first ten days of the Chiang Kai-shek occupation. A certain guerrilla unit in Si(yang) and Shu(yang), in coordination with a unit of the main force, crossed the Liutang River on New Year's Day and operated near the Chiang Kai-shek stronghold of Baji, fighting with the Chiang Kai-shek troops for 15 minutes, killing and wounding 13 Chiang Kai-shek troops below the rank of platoon leader, capturing 5, and seizing one machine gun and seven rifles and pistols, suffering no casualties themselves. More than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops from Suqian sallied out of the city on the 3rd to plunder, but were ambushed by the Suqian Detachment of the New Fourth Army at Guanlaomiao, more than 20 li east of the city. After suffering more than ten casualties, the Chiang Kai-shek troops abandoned their corpses and fled back. Wang Fengshan, the Huaihai militia artillery hero, has led his troops to advance into the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied border areas to fight guerrilla warfare.

    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: After the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded the cities of Yancheng and Funing last month, the masses in the ×× District of Sheyang County, east of the Chuanqiao River, launched a merit-making campaign to persist in on-the-spot struggle. Merit-making committees and merit evaluation groups were established in various villages, and fathers and sons, husbands and wives, and brothers competed to make contributions, setting merit-making standards. Anyone who captures or kills three Chiang Kai-shek troops will be awarded a special merit. Actively attacking Chiang Kai-shek troops often leads to captures, caring for the wounded and public property, reporting hidden enemy agents, actively educating and persuading others, not doing things for the enemy, and being able to remain steadfast and not reveal secrets if captured by the enemy are all rated as first, second, third, and fourth-class merits, depending on the circumstances. They are then submitted to the special commissioner's office and the county government for the awarding of "Merit Plaques" and publication of commendations in the newspaper. Dragging guns to defect and killing people and cadres, and seizing back the land of peasants are considered first-class offenses and are handed over to the masses for public trial; spreading rumors, looting, transporting grain to aid the enemy are considered second-class offenses and are sent to the government for legal action; leading the enemy is criticized by the masses and required to confess and provide a written guarantee. Specific measures for accumulating merits and demerits and offsetting demerits with merits are also formulated. After the above standards were announced, the militia of ×× Township in the district attacked the Chiang Kai-shek stronghold of Goudun near dusk on the 2nd, capturing 27 Chiang Kai-shek troops below the rank of platoon leader and intercepting two Chiang Kai-shek boats from Funing Chengnanlian, establishing the first merit.
