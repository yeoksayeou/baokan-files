    People and Cannons
    Yan Han
    The ancient city of Liaocheng was not captured by other weapons, but blasted open by American-made heavy artillery. This miracle was not only beyond the expectations of the American imperialist lackeys in China, but probably also beyond the initial calculations of the Sino-American reactionaries' "suppression plans" and "aid-to-Chiang plans," wasn't it?
    Judging from the experiences of these American-made heavy artillery pieces, they have already been peculiar enough. These heavy artillery pieces, originally intended to strike the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, were discovered to be trapped in the people's trap before they even fired a single shot on the front lines. I remember that General Liu Guangxin, the "special envoy for delivering cannons," once predicted before the breakout in Junan: "If we break out today, the people will survive, but the cannons will be lost; if we break out tomorrow, both the people and the cannons will be lost." General Liu's prediction came true. In this way, after the Chiang army paid a heavy price, the American-made heavy artillery fell into the hands of the people. When they were first put into battle, they performed extraordinary feats, forcing the traitor Wang Jinxiang to experience "the collapse of the people and the fall of the city." If the cannons had consciousness, they would also celebrate their good fortune of "abandoning the darkness and turning to the light," wouldn't they?
    The twentieth century is not only the century of science, but most importantly, it is the century of the people. Anyone who intends to go against the will of the people and perversely rely solely on scientific weapons will inevitably end up lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet. Ironclad facts prove that it is not the people who are destroyed, but precisely themselves!
    The cannon fire of Liaocheng is the roar of the people, a funeral dirge for the wandering souls of the Chiang-American reactionaries. All you wandering souls trapped in isolated cities, hoping for a lucky escape, listen to the cannon fire of Liaocheng! That cannon fire is warning you: the power of the people is not to be insulted! That cannon fire is teaching you: don't dream the wrong dream, the cities of the human world belong to the people, you can only occupy the Fengdu City of that ghost world.

    人民与炮
    严寒
    古老的聊城，不是用其它武器攻取的，而是用美式重炮轰开的，这种奇迹，不仅是出乎美帝国主义分子在中国的徒子徒孙们意料之外，恐怕也是中美反动派头子们的什么“进剿计划”、“援蒋计划”始料所不及的吧？
    从这些美式重炮的经历来看，已经够奇特的了，这种原拟打击解放区军民的重炮，初上前线一炮未放，却已发觉陷入人民的陷阱中了，记得“送炮专使”刘广信将军在鄄南突围前，曾经预言过：“今日突围，人存炮亡；明日突围，人炮俱亡”。刘将军的预言兑现了，就这样在蒋军付出重大牺牲之后，美式重炮转入人民之手，首次上阵，便建奇功，迫使王逆金祥也来了个“人溃城亡”，炮若有知，亦当自庆“弃暗投明”的幸运吧？
    二十世纪不仅是科学的世纪，而最主要的还是人民的世纪，谁个打算违背人民意志而单凭科学利器倒行逆施，其结果必然是搬起石头打自己的脚，铁一般的事实证明，被毁灭的不是人民，而正是他们自己！
    聊城的炮声是人民的怒吼，是蒋美反动派游魂们的送葬曲，一切困守孤城妄图侥幸的游魂们，你们听听聊城的炮声吧！那炮声在警告你们：人民的力量是不可侮的！那炮声在教训你们：别做错了梦，人世间的城市是属于人民的，你们只能占有那鬼＠世界的酆都城。
