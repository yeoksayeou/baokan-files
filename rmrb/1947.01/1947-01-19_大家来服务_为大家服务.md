　　People's Service

　　Everyone Serves, Serving Everyone
    In order to serve the 30 million people and cadres in the border region, we have specifically established this "People's Service" column as a bridge. To do this work well, we must first understand everyone's needs. Because our investigation and research are not sufficient, we will certainly not be able to fully meet everyone's needs at the beginning. What does "People's Service" do? In order to give everyone a place to offer criticisms, suggestions, and requests for various tasks in the border region, we have created the "Everyone Talks" column; in order to give everyone a place to answer questions in work, life, and study, we have created the "Reader Consultant" and "Brief Reply" columns. Since the opening of these columns, we have received many letters from readers, but the questions are still more focused on current events. We have transferred them to the fourth page "Current Affairs Q&A" to answer them. This column will focus more on some personal issues. We hope everyone will bring up more of them. In order to introduce some small pieces of knowledge that are useful for work and life, we have created the "Small Methods" column; in order to enable everyone to understand the general situation of our border region, we have created the "Border Region Small Knowledge" column. In addition, we also want to introduce knowledge in agricultural production, cultural and educational work, medical and health care, and specific methods for liberated peasants, military families, and honorably retired soldiers to establish new homes. We are currently hiring some experts as consultants, but it is best that everyone can do their best, know and spread knowledge immediately, and come out to help automatically. Whether these plans meet everyone's needs and whether they can be approved by everyone, we hope to get everyone's improvement opinions and modify and supplement them at any time in the process.
    This is a collective undertaking, which cannot be done well by a few people, but requires "everyone to serve" in order to truly "serve everyone"; therefore, we hope that the masses and cadres throughout the region, if you have anything to say, any questions to ask, any difficulties to solve, any help you need, ... whether it's your own or your fellow villagers', please write letters and articles and be an active and glorious model worker serving the people.
    In addition, we think: serving the people can not only be achieved by using the tool of words. If everyone needs it, we are also happy to devote manpower, time, and even materials (such as buying books, subscribing to newspapers, forwarding慰劳品, etc.) to provide various services. The "People's Service" column is a bridge between readers and us, and between readers themselves. We hope everyone will make full use of it.

### 大家来服务  为大家服务

专栏：人民服务

　　大家来服务  为大家服务
    为了给边区三千万人民和干部服务，我们特地建立了这个“人民服务”栏，当作一个桥梁。要作好这个工作，首先要了解大家的需要，由于我们调查研究得不够，一开头一定不能尽如人意。“人民服务”做些什么事情呢？为了让大家对边区各种工作有提出批评，建议和要求的地方，我们辟出“大家谈”栏；为了让大家工作、生活、学习中的疑问有地方解答，辟出“读者顾问”和“简复”栏。这几栏开辟以来，读者来信很多，但问题还多偏于时事，我们已移给四版“时事问答”解答，本栏则专重更切身的一些问题。希望大家更多地提出。为了介绍些对工作和生活有用的小常识，辟出“小办法”栏，为了使大家了解本边区的一般情况，辟出“边区小常识”栏。此外还想介绍些农业生产、文教工作、医药卫生等方面的知识和翻身农民、军属与荣退军人建立新家务的具体办法等。我们正在聘请一些专家作顾问，但最好大家都能各尽所长，即知即传，自动出来帮忙。这些打算是否切合大家需要，能否得到大家批准，希望在做的过程中，得到大家的改进意见随时修改与补充。
    这是件集体的事业，决非少数人所能作好，而是需要“大家来服务”，才能真正作到“为大家服务”的；所以希望全区的群众和干部同志们，有什么话要说，有什么疑问要问，有什么困难要解决，有什么事情要帮忙，……无论是你自己的或你所碰到的老乡们的，都请来信来稿，作一个积极为人民服务的光荣的模范工作者。
    另外，我们想：为人民服务，不光是用文字这个工具所能达到的，如果大家需要的话，我们还乐于分出人力、时间甚至物资（如代为买书、订报、转送慰劳品等等）来作各种服务。“人民服务”栏是读者和我们、读者互相之间的桥梁，希望大家尽量来利用。
