    In Mourning of Militia Hero Gao Huida
    Gao Huida, a cold-gun combat hero of the Hong Zhao militia, heroically sacrificed himself in battle for the independence of our motherland in democracy and peace. Upon receiving this news, we express our boundless sorrow and respect for the deceased, and our increasing anger and hatred for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!
    Gao Huida was an outstanding people's fighter and a leader revered by the local people. He wholeheartedly dedicated his energy to the people's liberation. From the day Chiang Kai-shek launched the civil war, he bravely threw himself into battle to defend the fruits of the people's liberation, to protect the liberated areas, and to safeguard the motherland's democracy, peace, and independence, leading the local people in defending their homes and fields. In battle, he demonstrated boundless loyalty to the people's cause, overcoming all difficulties and dangers. He frequently led his combat team into the enemy's rear along the Tongpu Railway line, engaging in cold-gun and landmine warfare, containing the enemy and providing significant assistance to the People's Liberation Army on the front lines. In October of last year alone, Gao Huida and his comrades Dong Baochang, Zhang Qikui, Zhang Xiaogen, and others, a total of eight people, annihilated more than forty of Hu Zongnan's and the puppet Yan's invading troops along the Tongpu line, becoming a glorious banner in the Hong Zhao people's armed forces. Under his influence, the people in the Hong Zhao area launched a campaign to compete in killing the enemy and earning merit. His name was spread among the people along the Tongpu line, and the enemy turned pale at the mere mention of it!
    Gao Huida's death is a major loss to the Chinese people's patriotic self-defense war. His death demonstrated his selfless dedication to the people's cause and to the struggle for the motherland's democracy and independence. He is a model of arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice in persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines; he is the glory of the people in the liberated areas and the supreme glory of the Chinese people!
    Gao Huida has heroically sacrificed himself, but we want to solemnly tell the traitor Chiang Kai-shek: One Gao Huida has fallen, but tens of thousands of Gao Huida are rising up. Countless Gao Huida will grow from the people, treading on his bloodstains and fighting bravely forward, and will never stop until the goal of democracy and independence is achieved!

    悼民兵英雄高辉达
    洪赵民兵冷枪战斗英雄高辉达，在战斗中，为祖国民主和平独立而英勇牺牲了。消息传来，我们对死者表示无限的婉惜与尊敬，对卖国贼蒋介石益增愤怒与仇恨！
    高辉达是一位出色的人民战士，是当地人民所拥戴的领袖，曾经全心全意把精力贡献于人民的翻身，从蒋介石响起内战的炮声那一天起，他便为了保卫人民的翻身果实，保卫解放区，保卫祖国的民主和平独立而勇敢的投入战斗，领导当地人民保乡保田。在战斗中，他表现了对人民事业的无限忠心，克服一切艰险，经常带领他的战斗队出没在敌人远后方的同蒲线上，展开冷枪、地雷战，牵制敌人，给了正面作战的人民解放军以重大的援助。仅去年十月一个月中，高辉达与他的战友董保常、张七奎、张小根等八人，即在同蒲沿线歼灭胡宗南及阎伪进犯军四十余名，成为洪赵人民武装中一面光辉的旗帜。在他的影响下，洪赵一带人民展开了杀敌立功竞赛运动，他的名字传颂于同蒲沿线人民口中，而使敌人闻风失色！
    高辉达之死，是中国人民爱国自卫战争的重大损失，他的死表现了他对于人民事业，对于祖国的民主独立的斗争奋不顾身，是坚持敌后游击战争艰苦奋斗，英勇牺牲的楷模；是解放区人民的光荣，是中国人民的无上光荣！
    高辉达英勇牺牲了，但是，我们要正告卖国贼蒋介石：一个高辉达倒下去了，成千万的高辉达正在站立起来，人民中会生长出无数的高辉达，踏着他的血迹奋勇战斗前进，不达民主独立的目的，决不会体止！
