    Yushe Resolves Contradictions Between Military Training, Production, and Land Review
    [From our newspaper] Yushe United Office reports: Several deviations have recently occurred in the county's winter work: 1. Production, mass mobilization, and military training are generally not well integrated. Some villages fail to focus on production during mass mobilization. Some villages overemphasize military training, affecting production. 2. Some villages lack a clear direction for the winter production movement. For example, Daoliu Village organized a mutual aid society, but only concentrated capital, without organizing most of the labor force, and slaughtered oxen for meat. Many mutual aid societies sold a considerable amount of consumables, such as alcohol and cigarettes, exhibiting a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. 3. Many village cooperatives have extravagant and wasteful phenomena and the idea of getting rich quickly. They want to do everything, resulting in overly dispersed funds and limited activity. For this reason, the county leadership specifically proposed: 1. In villages where mass mobilization is the primary focus, production should take place during the day, and meetings should be held in the evening to discuss and resolve problems. Military training should focus on young militiamen, once every morning or every other day; self-defense forces should focus on ideological education for participation in combat, once every five days. District and county joint defense gatherings should be held once every ten days, and finally, the district can hold a concentrated summary education session. 2. We must learn from mutual aid societies such as Nihekou and Dazhai, where everyone works and everyone prospers, with low expenses and no extravagance. In addition to generally organizing transportation, textiles, and workshops, cooperatives should provide the masses with wool and organize the sales of woolen products. 3. Focus on production with key points, and do as much as your strength allows; overcome the phenomenon of trying to do everything.

    榆社解决练武生产查减矛盾
    【本报讯】榆社联合办公室报导：本县冬季工作最近发生几点偏向：一、生产、群运、练武普遍结合不够，有些村不能在群运中抓紧生产。有的村过分强调了练武、影响了生产。二、有的村子对冬季生产运动的方向不明确，如道流村组织互助社，只集中资本，没组织大部劳力，且宰杀耕牛卖肉。大部互助社出售不少消耗品，如酒、纸烟等类。表现单纯的营利观点。三、不少村庄合作社有铺张浪费现象及贪发大财思想，啥也想闹，结果资金过分分散，活动不开。为此县领导上特提出：一、以群运为主村庄，白天生产，晚上开会讨论解决问题。练武着重在青年民兵，每早一次或隔日一次；自卫队着重参战思想教育，隔五天一次。区和县联防集合十天一次，最后区可集中一次总结教育。二、要学习泥河口、大寨等互助社，都劳动都发家，少开支不铺张。除一般组织运输、纺织、作坊等外，各合作社要供给群众羊毛、组织毛织品的销路。三、有重点的搞生产，有多大力量作多大事；克服面面俱到现象。
