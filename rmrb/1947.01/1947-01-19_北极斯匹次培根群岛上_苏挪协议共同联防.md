　　On the Arctic Spitsbergen Archipelago
    Joint Soviet-Norwegian Defense
    [This News Report] Moscow, TASS, January 15th—In recent days, Norwegian newspapers, as well as other foreign newspapers, have published reports about negotiations between the Soviet and Norwegian governments regarding the Arctic Spitsbergen Archipelago. Regarding these negotiations, Soviet authoritative sources have informed a TASS reporter that: when the Soviet side raised the issue of the need to revise the treaty on the Spitsbergen Archipelago concluded in Paris on February 9, 1920, negotiations were held between the Soviet and Norwegian governments in late 1944 and early 1945. This treaty was signed without notifying the Soviet Union and without Soviet participation, fundamentally changing the situation of the Spitsbergen Archipelago, which was still considered uninhabited at the time of signing. However, Medvezhy Island, which forms part of the Spitsbergen Archipelago, is in fact a Russian island. Moreover, since among the powers that signed the treaty were those that fought against the Allies in World War II (Note: referring to Japan and Italy), the treaty can no longer remain valid. The treaty completely disregards the Soviet Union's security interests in the North and the Soviet Union's important economic interests. As for the Soviet security issue, as World War II has especially clearly demonstrated, the Spitsbergen Archipelago has particular importance to the Soviet Union in the North in this regard. As for the economic importance of the Spitsbergen Archipelago to the Soviet Union, this can be seen from the fact that before World War II, the northern region of the Soviet Union and its northern maritime industry were supplied with coal mined by Soviet agencies in Spitsbergen, amounting to approximately 400,000 tons per year, while the total coal production of the island was 600,000 to 650,000 tons. In these Soviet-Norwegian negotiations, agreement has been reached on the necessity of joint defense of these islands.

　　北极斯匹次培根群岛上
    苏挪协议共同联防
    【本报讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：近数日来，挪威报纸以及其他外国的报纸，均刊载苏联与挪威两国政府间关于北极斯匹次培根群岛谈判的报导。关于这些谈判，苏联权威方面顷告塔斯社记者称：当苏方提出有修改一九二○年二月九日在巴黎缔结的关于斯匹次培根群岛条约之的必要的问题时，苏挪政府间在一九四四年末和一九四五年初曾举行谈判，该条约是在未通知苏联且无苏联参与之情形下签定的，根本上改变了迄签约时尚被认为是无人区的斯匹次培根群岛之形势。然而形成斯匹次培根群岛之一部的美得魏日岛，事实上乃俄罗斯之岛屿。尤有进者，既然签定该约之强国中，有在二次世界大战中对同盟国作战者，（按：指日意）则该约不能依然有效。该约全然蔑视苏联在北方的安全利益以及苏联重要的经济利益，至于苏联安全问题，正如二次世界大战已特别清楚证明者，斯匹次培根群岛在此问题上，对北方的苏联有其特殊重要性。至于斯匹次培根群岛对苏联之经济重要性，由此事实可知：在二次世界大战前，苏联北部地区及其北方舫海业是以苏联机关在斯匹次培根开采之煤供应的，每年约达四十万吨，而该岛煤的全部产量计六十万至六十五万吨。此次苏挪谈判，关于此等岛屿联防的必要巳获协议。
