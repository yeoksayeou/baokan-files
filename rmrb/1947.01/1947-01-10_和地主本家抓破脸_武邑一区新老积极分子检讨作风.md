    Breaking Face with Landlord Relatives
    New and Old Activists in Wu Yi District Examine Their Conduct
    [Our newspaper, Wei County, 8th dispatch] New and old activists in Wu Yi District gathered to examine their leadership style, strengthen unity, and lead the masses to thoroughly liberate themselves. At the meeting, many activists deeply reflected on their mistakes and shortcomings. Dong Qingchang said: "When distributing the fruits [of land reform], I took more and wanted better land. There were still zero-level households in the village who didn't get any land. Thinking about it, that was completely wrong. This time, I will never do things by myself; I will resolutely follow the mass line and smash the feudal forces." The vice-chief of Xizhaoqiao Village thought that because everyone was of the same surname and family when struggling against the landlord, it would be enough for the rich man to give out ten or eight mu of land to be divided. At the meeting, he said: "Now I know that if I don't break face [become ruthless], the aggrieved masses cannot pour out all their grievances and cannot thoroughly liberate themselves. In the future, I will definitely not be polite and will resolutely fight to the end." Chen Runsheng said: "I am a relative of a rich man. We constantly borrowed things from him, and sometimes he even gave me things. He seemed nice to me on the surface, but he was very harmful to the masses. The masses said several times they wanted to struggle against him, but I didn't want to and suppressed it. Today, I understand that all the peasants in the world are one family. After returning this time, I must listen to the opinions of the masses and fight against him no matter what." After deep reflection, everyone unanimously proposed future transformations. In particular, the old activists were determined and said in unison: "Not only will we say it here, but we will also admit our mistakes to the masses in the village." The new activists also resolved to learn from the old activists and tell the masses about the good points of the old activists. The meeting also proposed that new and old activists learn from each other, and old activists should not look down on new activists. They should help each other, unite, and jointly deal with stubborn landlords.

    和地主本家抓破脸
    武邑一区新老积极分子检讨作风
    【本报威县八日电】武邑一区新老积极分子集会检讨领导作风，加强团结，领导群众翻透身。会上很多积极分子，都深刻的反省了自己的错误和缺点。董庆昌说：“分果实时，我分得多，要的地质强；村里还有零级户，没有分给他们地，想起来太不对了。这次决不包办，坚决走群众路线，把封建势力打垮。”西赵桥村副在斗争地主时，认为都是一姓一家的，让财主拿出十亩八亩的来分分就算了，会上他说：“现在我知道我不挖破脸，就不能使受气的群众倒完苦水，也不能翻透身。以后我一定不客气，坚决斗到底。”陈润生说：“我是个财主的本家子，咱不断和人家借东西，有时人家还给我些东西，表面上对我不错；但对群众很危害，群众几次说斗他，我不愿意，给压下去了。今天想开了，天下的农民是一家，这次回去后，一定要听群众意见，非斗他不行。”经过深刻反省，大家一致提出今后转变，特别是老积极分子，都下定决心，异口同声的说：“不但在这里说，到村里也要向群众认错。”新积极分子并决心向老积极分子学习，并把老积极分子的好处说给群众。会上并提出新老积极分子互相学习，老积极分子也不要瞧不起新积极分子，互助团结，共同对付封顽地主。
