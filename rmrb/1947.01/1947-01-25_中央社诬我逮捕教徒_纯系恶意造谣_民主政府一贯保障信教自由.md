　　Central News Agency Slanders Us of Arresting Religious Believers
    Purely Malicious Rumor-Mongering
    Democratic Government Consistently Protects Freedom of Religious Belief
    [Yan'an, 23rd] Chiang's Central News Agency reported on the 22nd that Sun Lianzhong had obtained intelligence that the CCP headquarters had issued an order to arrest Catholics and Christians and confiscate their property. Xinhua News Agency is hereby ordered to declare that this is purely a malicious fabrication by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda organs and secret service agencies. Its purpose is to provoke disunity among the people in the Liberated Areas and to alienate the CCP from friendly foreign personages. The CCP and the democratic governments of the Liberated Areas have consistently protected freedom of religious belief, and there is no discrimination against Catholicism, just as there is absolutely no discrimination against Buddhists, Taoists, and Muslims.

　　中央社诬我逮捕教徒
    纯系恶意造谣
    民主政府一贯保障信教自由
    【延安二十三日电】蒋记中央社二十二日电称：孙连仲获得情报称，中共总部曾发出逮捕天主教徒、基督教徒，并没收其财产之命令。新华社顷奉命声明纯系蒋介石宣传机关与特务机关的恶意捏造。其目的在挑拨解放区人民内部之团结，离间中共与各友邦人士之关系。中共及各解放区民主政府一贯保障宗教信仰之自由，对天主教无歧视，正如对佛教道教回教徒绝无歧视一样。
