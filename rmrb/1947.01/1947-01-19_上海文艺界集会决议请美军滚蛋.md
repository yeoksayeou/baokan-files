　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. The Shanghai Branch of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a year-end party at the Tsinghua Alumni Association on Jiujiang Road at 8 p.m. on December 29th of last year. More than 100 people from literary, art, drama and other circles attended. During the meeting, it was proposed: "Our year-end party is solemn, and we should not forget the atrocities of the U.S. military in Peiping; Chinese writers cannot tolerate this insult, and hope that those present will sign a draft protest letter asking the U.S. military to get out." The attendees unanimously passed a motion to have Xiong Foxi and Pan Jinong draft the protest letter. The party ended at 11 p.m. In addition to speeches and poetry recitations by Hu Feng, Tian Han, Xiong Foxi, and Pan Jinong, the Xingqi Conservatory of Music choir also sang famous songs such as "Forced to Join the Liangshan Rebels" and "Sweep Away Fascism." Before the end of the meeting, Hu Feng summarized everyone's opinions on literature and art, pointing out that the writers and works that China needs today must be combined with the people's struggle and suffering, and only such artistic works can produce value.

　　上海文艺界集会决议请美军滚蛋
    中华全国文协上海分会，于去年十二月廿九日下午八时假九江路清华同学会举行辞年晚会，到文艺、戏剧等各界百余人。会中经人提议：“我们举行辞年晚会是沉痛的，我们不应该忘记美军在北平的暴行；中国作家不能忍受这一侮辱，希望与会的签名草一抗议书，请美军滚蛋”。当经与会人士一致通过推熊佛西、潘孑农二人起草抗议书。晚会至十一时始散。会中除胡风、田汉、熊佛西、潘孑农等演讲及诗歌朗诵外，尚有星期音乐学院合唱“逼上梁山”、“扫除法西斯”等名曲。散会前，曾由胡风总结大家对文艺意见，指出今天中国要求的作家与作品是要与人民的斗争痛苦相结合，只有这样的艺术作品，才能产生价值。
