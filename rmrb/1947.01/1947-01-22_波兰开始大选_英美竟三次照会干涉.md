Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Warsaw dispatch: Poland's first free election is scheduled to be held today, and voter meetings are being enthusiastically held throughout the country. Prior to the election, the British and American governments raised questions about the so-called manner of the election campaign and sent notes to the Polish government. The United States even submitted them three times. The Polish government replied, believing that their notes were clearly based on distorted prejudices and that the election was based on Polish law and that foreign interference was unjustified.

This newspaper reports: TASS Warsaw, January 17th: According to Polish newspapers, the former Mikolajczyk Peasant Party Congress was held in Krakow, attended by 1,200 people. The representatives unanimously approved the election program of the democratic parties and trade union alliance. At the meeting, Marian Lubinski, the former Peasant Party member and deputy mayor of Krakow, delivered a speech sharply criticizing the Peasant Party's policies, especially Mikolajczyk's disruptive election behavior.

　　波兰开始大选
    英美竟三次照会干涉
    【新华社延安十九日电】华沙讯：波兰首次自由大选定于今日举行，选民会议正在全国各地热烈集会。在大选之前，英美政府关于所谓选举运动的方式，发生疑问，曾向波兰政府提出照会，美国且提出三次之多，俱经波兰政府加以答复，认为他们的照会显然是以歪曲的成见为基础，认为选举是根据波兰的法律，外国的干涉是毫无道理的。
    【本报讯】塔斯社华沙十七日电：据波兰报纸载，前米柯拉兹科农民党党员大会已在克拉科城举行，出席一千二百人，代表们一致赞成各民主党派和职工联盟的集团之选举纲领。会议上克拉科副市长前农民党党员马利安，卢宾斯基发表演说，尖锐抨击农民党政策，特别是米柯拉兹科的破坏选举行为。
