Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to the Shanghai press, the details of the Wuhan student march on the 5th of this month are as follows: On that day, more than 5,000 students participated in the demonstration, and the long-silent three towns of Wuhan issued a large-scale patriotic roar for the first time. When the news of the atrocities committed by American soldiers in Beiping reached Wuhan on the 27th, the students paid close attention to the government's actions with anger and waited quietly for five days. The Kuomintang authorities' shameless attitude of explaining and exonerating the American soldiers deeply disappointed them. They could no longer bear it. More than 140 student representatives from colleges and universities in Wuhan held a joint meeting on the 3rd and decided to march on the 5th. Among them, Wuhan University, Art College, Agricultural College, Medical College, and Physical Education College decided to strike for a week. At 7 a.m. on the 5th, teams of middle school and university students began to assemble and set off, first in Wuchang, and then crossed the river to Hankou. The marching teams sang songs such as "Demonstration March" and "Drive Away the American Soldiers". Spectators and children on both sides sang along automatically, and many people joined the team; the team grew larger and larger. When they arrived at the gate of the Provisional Headquarters, they handed in the "Protest Against the Atrocities of the American Soldiers" amidst the slogans of "Oppose the Sino-US Commercial Treaty" and the singing of "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves!...". When passing the US Consulate on Yanjiang Avenue, the doors and windows of the consulate building were tightly closed, and the American flag had already been removed. The students shouted: "Our government invited you here, our people ask you to get out!" "Get out quickly!"

    【新华社延安二十日电】据沪报载武汉学生本月五日游行之详情称：是日参加示威学生达五千余人，无声多年的武汉三镇第一次大规模的发出爱国怒吼。当北平美军暴行消息二十七日传到武汉后，同学们以愤怒的心情关注着政府的行动，静候了五天，国民党当局为美军解说开脱的无耻态度使他们深为失望，他们不能再忍耐了，武汉各专科以上学生代表百四十余人遂于三日举行联合会，议决五日游行。其中武大、艺专、农院、医学院、体专等校且决定罢课一周。五日上午七时，各大中学生队伍即开始集合出发，先在武昌，后即渡河至汉口，游行队伍高唱《示威进行曲》及《赶走美军》等歌。两旁观众和儿童自动随唱，且有许多民众自动加入队伍；队伍愈来愈壮大。到达行辕门前，在“反对中美商约”的口号及“起来！不愿做奴隶的人们！……”的歌声中，递上“抗议美军暴行书”；经沿江大道美领事馆时，领事馆楼房门窗紧闭，美国旗也早已撤去；学生高呼：“我们政府请你们来，我们人民请你们滚！”“快滚！”
