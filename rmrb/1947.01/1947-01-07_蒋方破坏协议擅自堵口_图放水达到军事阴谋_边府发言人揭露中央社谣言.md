    Border Government Spokesperson Exposes Central News Agency's Rumors

    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The spokesperson for the Border Government issued the following statement regarding the rumors fabricated by the Central News Agency on the 27th regarding the "Talks of the Shandong Provincial County Friendship Association in Jinan": The Yellow River has been a scourge to China for a long time, and it was even more serious during the Kuomintang's rule of China. From 1917 to 1937, there were a total of 12 breaches, and from 1930 to 1937 alone, there were 6 breaches, and the area and duration of the inundation were even worse than before. Since the enemy's surrender, the Kuomintang, with the help of UNRRA materials and technology, has been carrying out repatriation projects, violating previous agreements, using floods for military and political conspiracies, robbing our flood control materials, destroying downstream projects, and bombing our people involved in dike repair. From this, it can be seen that it is not the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army that are destroying the projects, but the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek's army. This is the ironclad fact of the past and present, and the people on both sides of the Yellow River will understand. Isn't the Central News Agency's fabrication of rumors like putting ashes on its own face? If the "Shandong Provincial County Friendship Association" really has a little conscience and is willing to speak for the people downstream, first, they should unite with the people in the Liberated Areas to demand that the Kuomintang faithfully fulfill the previous agreements, immediately stop the closure and release of water, and allocate funds, materials, and relocation expenses for the residents so that we can complete the embankment restoration and repair projects as soon as possible; second, they should immediately turn back and awaken, stand together with the people in the Liberated Areas to oppose the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, oppose the civil war, and oppose the fake National Assembly and fake constitution. Only by demanding the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and establishing a democratic coalition government can you avoid the great disaster of the Yellow River for thousands of years and achieve a free and happy state!

    蒋方破坏协议擅自堵口
    图放水达到军事阴谋
    边府发言人揭露中央社谣言
    【本报特讯】边府发言人，就中央社二十七日所造“济南‘鲁省各县联谊会’之谈话”的谣言发表谈话如下：黄河为害中国历史已久，在国民党统治中国时期，更为严重。民国六年到二十六年，共决口十二次，而十九年到廿六年即决口六次，且淹没之面积及时期，均较以前有过之无不及。敌人投降后，国民党借联总物资技术之助，进行归故工程以来，违反历次协议，利用洪水进行军事政治阴谋，抢劫我复堤物资，破坏下游工程，轰炸我修险人民群众，由此可见破坏工程的不是共产党八路军，正是国民党蒋家军。这是过去和现在铁的事实，黄河两岸人民都会了解，中央社造谣，岂不是拿上灰往自己的脸上摸吗？而“鲁省各县联谊会”如果真是有一点人心，愿代表下游人民讲话，第一应同解放区人民一致起来要求国民党忠实履行历次协议，立刻停止合龙放水，并拨给我们工款物资居民迁移费，以便我们即早完成复堤，修险等工程；第二应该立刻回头觉悟，同解放区人民站在一体反对国民党一党独裁，反对内战，反对伪国大伪宪法。要求实行政协决议，建立民主的联合政府，你们才能免却黄河数千年来的大患，而达到自由幸福之境地！
