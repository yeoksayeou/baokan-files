　　Borneo and Other Islands People
    Demand Integration into Indonesia
    Actively Oppose the Dutch Occupation Authorities
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 27th】TASS, The Hague, December 25th: Newspapers publish dispatches from Indonesia stating: As the Constitutional Conference discusses the members of the United States of Indonesia, the people of Borneo and Sulawesi are actively opposing the Dutch occupation authorities in order to demand complete independence and integration into the Republic of Indonesia. Various people's organizations have appealed to the government of the Republic of Indonesia, urging them to help them obtain a merger with the Republic of Indonesia. During the war, the people of the two islands actively resisted Japan, hoping to gain freedom after the victory. After Japan surrendered, British troops immediately arrived on the two islands to suppress the democratic movement. Later, the administrative power of the two islands was given to the Dutch authorities. Now the people of the two islands are fighting to achieve independence, especially on Sulawesi Island. Note: In the armistice agreement signed between the Netherlands and Indonesia in October, the Dutch side only recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia over the three islands of Java, Sumatra, and Manila (with a total area of 210,000 square miles and a population of 55 million), and attempted to keep Borneo and Sulawesi as its colonies. Borneo has an area of 200,000 square miles and a population of 2.4 million; Sulawesi has an area of 72,000 square miles and a population of 4.6 million.

    要求并入印尼
    积极反对荷兰占领当局
    【新华社延安十二月二十七日电】塔斯社海牙二十五日电：各报刊载印尼来电称：正当制宪会议讨论印尼合众国成员之际，婆罗洲与西里伯斯两岛人民，为要求完全独立并并入印尼共和国事，刻正积极反对荷兰占领当局。各人民团体均向印尼共和国政府呼吁，促请帮助他们获得与印尼共和国合并。战时两岛人民曾积极抗日，希望能于胜利后获得自由。日本投降后，英军立即抵达该两岛，镇压民主运动。其后，即将该两岛行政权给荷兰当局。现两岛人民正为完成独立而奋斗，特别在西里伯斯岛。按：荷兰与印尼于十月间所订停战协定中，荷方仅承认印尼共和国在爪哇、苏门答腊及马尼拉三岛（面积共二十一万方里，人口共五千五百万）之主权，而企图使婆、西两岛仍旧为其殖民地。婆罗洲面积二十万方英里，人口二百四十万；西里伯斯面积七万二千方英里，人口四百六十万。
