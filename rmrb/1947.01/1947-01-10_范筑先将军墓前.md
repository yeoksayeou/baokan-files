    Before General Fan Zhuxian's Tomb
    Tian Bing
    Comrade Tian Bing was General Fan Zhuxian's confidential secretary before the fall of Liaocheng in 1938, and was besieged in Liaocheng with General Fan. After Liaocheng fell, he escaped in disguise. He is now working with the front-line journalist group. This poem was written after the author followed our army to liberate Liaocheng and paid respects at General Fan's tomb.
          —Editor

    The time for fair judgment has come,
    The people's hatred will not disappear in a day,
    The chief culprits will never escape.
    Above the verdant wheat fields,
    Chasing warriors are galloping on horseback…
    Nine years since we parted, Commander!
    The young people you praised have returned.
    But, we can no longer see you,
    Can no longer see the kind and benevolent old General,
    Can no longer see the prosperous Liaocheng,
    Liaocheng, how many desolate tombs!
    Your tomb is in front of Wanshou Temple,
    Behind the tomb is a field of desolate graves,
    Covered with fresh white grass.
      ×        ×        ×
    We offer sacrifices to you,
    Standing before your tomb,
    I wept silently!
    The Kuomintang borrowed a knife from the Japanese bandits,
    And killed this old hero of the nation.
    You were like an old ox of the nation,
    The Communist Party helped you cultivate the land of the motherland.
    One hundred thousand patriotic heroes,
    Raised high the banner of "conscientious resistance against Japan,"
    Traitors are always timid, fearful, and jealous…
    The Kuomintang said "Shandong is half red,"
    And hurriedly bought off your chief of staff, Wang Jinxiang,
    Secretly laying a sinister net of crime.
        ×    ×    ×
    At that time, we were all kept in the dark,
    Although sometimes we knew some clues,
    But because we had the minds of Chinese people,
    We never expected it.
    The enemy was at the city's gates,
    You so calmly and composedly
    Sent Wang Jinxiang out of the city to command,
    But he stood on the levee outside the north gate,
    Laughing heartily at the enemy's artillery fire,
    Laughing heartily at our ignorance.
        ×    ×    ×
    That night, that sad and heroic night!
    Comrade Zhang Yuguang (Principal of the Political Cadre School), Comrade Yao Dihong (Director of the Political Department), and you,
    The few of us faced each other with anger and grief,
    Comrade Yuguang said: "Rather than the city being broken, we should charge out."
    Comrade Dihong also said "Charge!"
    Everyone said "Charge!"
    Only you, Commander, frowned tightly,
    And said, word by word:
    "Think about it,
    Liaocheng is surrounded by water on all sides,
    There are only four gates for passage,
    The enemy has blocked them with firepower,
    Charging out is always unsafe.
    I am old, and my death is insignificant,
    You are all promising young people,
    How can I ask you to die with me?
    If Wang Jinxiang thinks that I, an old man, am still left in the city,
    Can he not come to rescue us?
    Listen,
    In a little while, there will be the sound of gunfire from the reinforcements."
        ×    ×    ×
    Commander, at that time, we put our ears to the ground,
    Wishing we could turn every pore into an ear,
    To listen for the sound of gunfire from the villages over there,
    But, we listened throughout the black night of November 14, 1938,
    We only heard the desolate autumn night, only the falling leaves knocking in the autumn wind,
    The cannons roared,
    The artillery fire was burning the sky blood red.
        ×    ×    ×
    Comrade Dihong said indignantly:
    "Wang Jinxiang has already sold us out,
    What reinforcements are we hoping for?"
    Commander, you didn't say anything,
    Just sighed deeply.
    I know the pain in your heart,
    You were thinking: "We are conscientiously resisting Japan,
    Eating cornbread,
    Wearing coarse cloth clothes,
    With unwavering loyalty,
    Defending the land of the motherland,
    Why are we being plotted against"!
    Commander! We always use conscience to influence everything,
    How could we know that Wang Jinxiang was only wearing human skin!?
        ×    ×    ×
    Commander, once we parted from you,
    It became an eternal separation,
    That was at 10:00 AM on November 15, 1938,
    You and Comrade Dihong went to the east gate to supervise the battle,
    Comrade Yuguang, Comrade Lu Ziheng (Commander of the pistol battalion) and I were sitting in the headquarters,
    At noon, Liaocheng completely fell,
    The fierce street fighting continued until dark,
    The streets were flowing with human blood,
    The eaves were dripping with human blood,
    On that very night,
    You raised your gun to your chest,
    Shouted long live the motherland three times,
    And said goodbye to the people forever.
        ×    ×    ×
    You died like this,
    But the Japanese invaders and traitors built a tomb for you,
    The murderers feigned disgusting "piety,"
    Wanting to use their blood-stained hands,
    To cover the eyes and ears of the world.
    But bloody hands cannot suppress people's hearts,
    The hearts of the five million people of northwestern Shandong,
    Have already engraved the epitaph,
    The knife that killed you, General Fan Zhuxian,
    Was borrowed by the Kuomintang from Japan.
        ×    ×    ×
    Regardless of wind, rain, hunger, or cold,
    The young people and children you often spoke of,
    Are all firmly guarding the land created with blood and tears.
    For nine years, the artillery fire has been like one day,
    The sandstorms on both sides of the Yellow River,
    Have aged the children of that year,
    The Communist Party that helped you has not left,
    The comrades who followed you in the war of resistance have not left,
    Everyone is fighting for this time of fair judgment.
        ×    ×    ×
    When the Japanese invaders surrendered,
    Everyone hoped that the criminals would be brought to justice,
    Who would have thought that the current "court,"
    Is the master of evil.
    Criminals are promoted and given titles,
    The people of Liaocheng continue to suffer the consequences of the criminals' sins.
        ×    ×    ×
    Today, the people's army that "avenges Commander Fan,"
    Has liberated Liaocheng,
    We offer sacrifices to you.
    I stand before your tomb,
    Tears streaming down my face.
    The time for fair judgment has come,
    The people's hatred will not disappear in a day,
    The chief culprits will never escape.
    Above the verdant wheat fields,
    Chasing warriors are galloping on horseback…
        (Night of January 6, 1947, in Liaocheng)

    范筑先将军墓前
    田兵
    作者田兵同志，在一九三八年聊城沦陷前，曾任范筑先将军机要秘书，与范将军困守聊城。聊城失陷后化装逃出。现参加前线记者团工作，此诗即为作者随我军光复聊城，亲谒范将军墓后之作。
          ——编者
    是公平裁判的时候，
    人民的仇恨一日不消，
    罪魁祸首永远难逃。
    碧绿的麦野之上，
    追击的勇士正在纵马奔跑……
    一别九年，司令啊！
    你所称赞的青年人回来了。
    但是，已经看不到你，
    看不到和蔼慈祥的老将军了，
    看不到繁荣的聊城了，
    聊城，多少荒凉的墓啊！
    你的墓前是万寿观，
    墓后一片荒坟，
    漫着新鲜的白草。
      ×        ×        ×
    我们祭奠你，
    站在你的墓前，
    我默默地哭了！
    国民党借刀日寇，
    杀死了这位年老的英豪。
    你像一只民族的老牛，
    共产党帮着你耕开了祖国的大地。
    十万爱国的健儿，
    高高举起“良心抗战”的大旗，
    卖国的人，总是胆小、恐惧和嫉妒………
    国民党说“山东红了半个天”，
    急忙收买了你的参谋长王金祥，
    暗暗地布下了罪恶的罗网。
        ×    ×    ×
    那时候，我们都蒙到鼓里，
    虽然有时候也知道蛛丝马迹，
    但因为我们是中国人的脑子，
    总不会料到。
    敌人兵临城下了，
    你那么沈着镇静地
    派王金祥出城指挥，
    他却站在北门外的大堤上，
    笑哈哈地看敌人的炮火，
    笑哈哈地奚落我们无知。
        ×    ×    ×
    那夜，那悲凉壮烈的夜啊！
    张郁光同志（政干校校长）姚第鸿同志（政治部主任）和你，
    我们几个人愤怒哀痛地面面相对，
    郁光同志说：“与其城破，不如冲”。
    第鸿同志也说“冲”
    大家都说“冲”，
    只有你司令紧皱着眉头，
    一字一字地说：
    “你们想想看，
    聊城四面环水，
    只有四门可通，
    敌人用火力封住了，
    冲总是不安全的。
    我老了，死不足轻重，
    你们都是有为的青年，
    我能叫您陪着我死吗？
    王金祥想到老头我还撇在城里，
    能不来救吗？
    你们听一听，
    一会会有救兵的枪声。”
        ×    ×    ×
    司令啊，那时候我们把耳朵伏到地上，
    恨不得把毛孔都变作耳朵，
    去听那边村里有没有枪声，
    可是，听彻了一九三八年十一月十四日的黑夜，
    只听得秋夜凄凉，只有落叶敲着秋风，
    大炮隆隆地响，
    炮火正烧的满天血红。
        ×    ×    ×
    第鸿同志愤激地说：
    “王金祥早把我们卖了，
    还盼什么救兵？”
    司令，你没有说什么，
    只是长叹了一声。
    我知道你心灵的悲痛，
    你是在想：“我们良心抗战、
    吃窝窝头，
    穿粗布衣，
    赤胆忠心，
    捍卫祖国的土地，
    为什么会遭到算计”！
    司令啊！我们常用良心去感化一切，
    那知道王金祥只披着人皮！？
        ×    ×    ×
    司令啊，和你一分手，
    就成了永远的别离，
    那是一九三八年十一月十五日上午十时，
    你和第鸿同志到东门督战，
    我和郁光同志、路子恒同志（手枪营长）坐守在司令部里，
    午间聊城完全陷落了，
    猛烈的巷战一直搏斗到黑夜，
    街上淌着人血，
    房檐上淌着人血，
    就在那天晚上，
    你举枪对着自己的胸膛，
    三呼祖国万岁，
    和人民长远地告别了。
        ×    ×    ×
    你是这样死的，
    而日寇汉奸却又替你修建坟墓，
    杀人犯假装着令人恶心的“虔诚”，
    想用涂满血腥的双手，
    掩盖天下人的耳目。
    可是血手捺不住人心，
    鲁西北五百万人民的心里，
    早已刻好了碑文，
    杀害你范筑先将军的刀子，
    是国民党借于日本。
        ×    ×    ×
    不论风雨饥寒，
    你常说的青年、孩子，
    都在坚守着用血和着泪创造的土地。
    九年来炮火如一日，
    黄河两岸上的风沙，
    吹老了当年的孩子，
    帮助你的共产党没有走，
    追随你抗战的同志们都没有走，
    大家争取着这个公平裁判的时候。
        ×    ×    ×
    当日寇投降的时候，
    都指望罪人就审，
    谁想当今的“朝廷”，
    就是罪恶的主人。
    罪人加官进爵，
    聊城人民继续领受着罪人的孽绩。
        ×    ×    ×
    今天“为范司令报仇”的人民军队，
    解放聊城了，
    我们奠祭你。
    我站在你的墓前，
    热泪横流。
    是公平裁判的时候，
    人民的仇恨一日不消，
    罪魁祸首永远难逃。
    碧绿的麦野之上，
    追击的勇士正在纵马奔跑……
        （一九四七年一月六日夜于聊城）
