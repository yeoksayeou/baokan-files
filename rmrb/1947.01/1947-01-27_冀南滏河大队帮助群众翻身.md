    [This Newspaper Reports] The Fuhe Brigade of Jinnan actively helps the masses of Linzhang to turn over. At struggle meetings in villages such as Heilongmiao and Nanzhuang, after representatives of the First Battalion stated that the troops would support the masses, the masses all said, "Let's do it, what is there to be afraid of?" The enthusiasm for struggle greatly increased. The troops guarding the river defenses successively captured Wang Yulin, the tyrannical landlord of Wangzhuang, and Li Liansan and Li Mouzheng, the puppet Baochang and traitors of Changcun, and handed them over to the masses for struggle. As a result, the masses in the Fifth District of Linzhang quickly turned over, and every poor peasant was allocated land. At the celebration of victory, the masses unanimously said, "Our liberation is thanks to the help of the Fuhe Brigade."
