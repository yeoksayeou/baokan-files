More than 300 cadres in Jining gathered to study how to complete land reform with armed support. They first discussed their understanding of this self-defense war and land reform. Everyone unanimously agreed that the implementation of land reform is the foundation for victory in the war. Next, they analyzed the situation and work guidelines. Although the situations in each district are slightly different, they all agreed that land reform must be carried out. In the border areas, armed forces will defend the peasants' liberation, while in the old areas, a "fill-in-the-gaps" movement will be carried out to redistribute any remaining land. The district's armed work teams and county's large detachment participating in the meeting all expressed their willingness to work with local comrades to carry out land reform. The county detachment proposed specific assistance to × district. In terms of methods, they will strengthen propaganda, train activists, organize work teams, and establish land evaluation committees at the village, sub-district, and district levels. They will identify cadres within the district to be solely responsible for leading the armed forces and strengthen the struggle against the enemy in the border areas.
