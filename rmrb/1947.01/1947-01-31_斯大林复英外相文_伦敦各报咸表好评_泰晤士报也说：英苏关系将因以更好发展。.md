Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 28th: Moscow, January 27th broadcast: London newspapers continue to comment on the exchange of letters between Stalin and Bevin. The Times's diplomatic commentator wrote that the exchange of notes between Stalin and Bevin indicates that Anglo-Soviet friendly relations may enter a new and more friendly development. These two notes clarify the two countries' positions on the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. The London Evening Standard wrote that the exchange of notes has achieved good results. Stalin's proposal to re-examine and consolidate the treaty is a reasonable step. If this step leads to the expansion of the treaty's obligations and mutual assistance in post-war economic matters, it will be of particular significance.
