　　Seeking Contributions on Ideological and Professional Learning

　　Studying Mao Zedong Thought and mastering professional skills are essential matters for every working comrade, and with the beginning of the new year, it is even more important to seize the opportunity. This publication is extremely willing to allocate considerable space as a forum for comrades to exchange experiences, conduct research, and engage in discussions. We hope that everyone will actively use this method of collective learning by exchanging opinions in the newspaper. At the same time, we also hope that various localities and work departments will urge the submission of good reflection notes, discussion records, and manuscripts to us. To stimulate interest, we are first presenting the following two topics, but naturally, we are not limited to these. Please write and submit as much as possible!

　　1. Ideological progress or problems after reading several important New Year's articles.

　　(Namely: Chairman Mao's New Year's greetings, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's "Ten Major Tasks for 1947," Deputy Political Commissar Bo's "New Year's Message," the Liberation Daily editorial "Striving Hard to Welcome the Light," and Comrade Lu Dingyi's "Explanation of Several Basic Issues in the Post-War International Situation," etc., or any one of these articles.)

　　2. A little experience in professional learning.

　　(Various kinds of professions: combat, mass work, finance and economics, culture and education... all can express their own views.)

　　征求思想和业务学习的文稿
    学习毛泽东思想和精通业务，是每一位工作同志的要事，新年开始，更要抓紧一把。本刊极愿划出相当篇幅，作为同志们交换心得，研究讨论的园地。希望大家积极来运用在报上交换意见这种集体学习的方法；同时也盼望各地方各工作部门催促着把好的反省笔记、讨论记录和文稿寄给我们。为了引起兴味，我们先出下面的两个题，但自然是不限制于此的。请尽量写了寄来吧！
    一、读了几篇重要新年论文后思想上的进展或问题。
    （即：毛主席新年祝词，朱总司令的《一九四七年十大任务》，薄副政委的《新年献词》，解放日报社论《艰苦奋斗迎接光明》及陆定一同志的《对于战后国际形势中几个基本问题的解释》等文或其中任何一篇。）
    二、学习业务的一点经验。
    （各种各样的业务：战斗、群运、财经、文教………都可各述己见。）
