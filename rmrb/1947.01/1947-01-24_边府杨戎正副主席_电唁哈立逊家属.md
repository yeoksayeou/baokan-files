　　Bian District Government Chairmen Yang and Vice-Chairman Rong
　　Send Condolences to the Harrison Family
　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The telegram from the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government to the family of Mr. Harrison is as follows:
　　Mr. Dong Biwu in Nanjing, please forward to the family of Mr. Harrison in Canada:
　　We have just received a telegram dated the 10th of this month from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office of this government, informing us that Mr. Harrison suddenly passed away in Zhangqiu Town, Hebei-Shandong-Henan on January 10th. The sad news has arrived, and we are deeply saddened. During the Chinese War of Resistance, Mr. Harrison established a deep friendship with the Chinese people and participated in the medical work of our New Fourth Army. After the victory, he devoted himself to relief, health, and welfare undertakings, transporting medicines to the liberated areas, enduring hardships, and declaring the liberated areas as his second hometown. This time, when he came to the border region from Shanghai, in addition to bringing medicines, Mr. Harrison had decided to participate in the medical work of the liberated areas, which the people of our region welcomed very much. Now, such an unexpected event has occurred, which is not only a misfortune for your family, but also a loss of a sincere and great friend for our liberated area. We hope you will take care and restrain your grief. We hereby send our condolences! We are preparing a grand memorial service for Mr. Harrison's death to commemorate him.
　　Yang Xiufeng, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government

　　边府杨戎正副主席
    电唁哈立逊家属
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府电唁哈立逊先生家属原电如下：
    南京董必武先生转加拿大哈立逊先生家属礼鉴：
    顷接本府冀鲁豫行署十日电，据悉哈立逊先生于元月十日在冀鲁豫张秋镇突然病逝，噩耗传来，此间至深哀悼，哈先生生前在中国抗战期间，即与中国人民建立了深厚的友谊，并曾参加我新四军医务工作。胜利后，又致力救济卫生福利事业，为解放区运输药品，历尽艰辛，并声言解放区为他的第二故乡。此次从上海来边区，除带有药品外，哈先生已决定参加解放区医务工作，本区人民对此欢迎万分；今竟遭此不测，不仅为尊属之不幸，我解放区亦失一真诚伟大之良友，尚希珍重节哀，特电致唁！我们对哈先生之死，正筹备隆重追悼，以资纪念。
