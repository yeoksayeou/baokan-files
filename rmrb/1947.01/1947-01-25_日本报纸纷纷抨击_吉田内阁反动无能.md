　　Japanese Newspapers Criticize the Reactionary and Incompetent Yoshida Cabinet

　　[Comprehensive Report by This Newspaper] Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 19th to the 21st: Japanese newspapers are criticizing the reactionary and incompetent Yoshida Cabinet. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun said: The Yoshida government absolutely cannot stop the trend of inflation or raise the level of production. What it is actually doing is trying its best to create the worst conditions for the working class, and it is fiercely opposed by most organized workers and farmers. No matter what trick of a "political truce movement" he uses to curb the workers' movement to overthrow the cabinet, the facts will prove it futile. "Jiji News" demanded the dissolution of the Diet and attacked Yoshida's transfer of Agriculture and Forestry Minister Hiroo Wada as mere window dressing. Whatever decisions Yoshida makes, all policies will be impossible to implement without the cooperation of the labor unions. The editorial of the Tokyo "Mainichi Shimbun" urged Yoshida to resign and demanded the formation of a cabinet led by the Socialist Party. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated: The Liberal Party and the Progressive Party should be held responsible for the current political chaos, and Yoshida should resign immediately.

　　日本报纸纷纷抨击
    吉田内阁反动无能
    【本报综合报导】据新华社十九日至二十一日电讯：日本报纸纷纷抨击吉田内阁反动无能。东京朝日新闻说：吉田政府绝对不能阻止通货膨胀之趋势及提高生产水平，其实际所为系在竭力创造工人阶级最坏之景况，受到大多数有组织的工人和农民的激烈反对。不管他用什么“政治休战运动”的诡计来遏制工人的倒阁运动，事实将证明徒劳无益。“时事新闻”要求解散议会并攻击吉田调动农林省大臣和田博雄，仅是粉饰，无论吉田有些什么决定，如果不能得到工会的合作，一切政策均将不能实现。东京“每日新闻”的社论，敦促吉田辞职，并要求组成一个以社会党为首的内阁。“读卖新闻”称：自由党与进步党应对目前政治情况之混乱负责，吉田应立即辞职。
