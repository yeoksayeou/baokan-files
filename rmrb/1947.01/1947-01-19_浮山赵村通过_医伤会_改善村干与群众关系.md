　　[This report from our correspondent in Taiyue on the 17th] To clear the obstacles in the path of implementing "land to the tiller," mass movements have reignited in Qinshui and Fushan. According to reports from correspondents in Qinshui and Fushan counties, in the mountainous old areas of these counties, despite several years of rent and interest reduction, feudal forces have not been eliminated. A considerable number of village administrations are still controlled by feudal forces, preventing the majority of the masses from standing up, causing the movement to stall. Amidst the district-wide wave of winter inspections for achieving liberation, the masses in these two counties spontaneously joined the movement. Qinshui first erupted in villages such as Wei Village in the Seventh District. Farmers themselves established "Land Reform Committees," first sealing the doors of landlords and despots, convening mass meetings, and conducting liquidations. This influenced surrounding villages and the entire county, with many farmers who had gone out to work returning to participate in the struggle. Currently, the movement has reached a climax. In Hedicun Village, Fushan, village cadres shielded landlords. With the help of district cadres, relations between cadres and the masses were improved, and the movement developed vigorously. In other villages, such as Hancun, Zhaojia Nian, and Zhao Village, cadres and the masses, through "Healing Wounds Meetings," conducted mutual self-criticism, and the county-wide movement was reignited.

　　浮山赵村通过“医伤会”改善村干与群众关系
    【本报太岳十七日电】扫清实行耕者有其田道路中的障碍，沁水、浮山两地群众运动再起。据沁水浮山两地通讯员报导该县山地老区，过去曾经数年减租减息，封建势力仍未消灭，尚有不少村政权仍被封建势力把持，致使大多数群众仍未抬头，运动陷于停顿状态，在全区冬季翻身大检查浪潮中，该两县群众亦自发卷入运动。沁水首先从七区卫村等村爆发，农民自己成立“土地改革委员会”，先查封了地主恶霸的门，召开群众大会，进行清算，由此影响周围村庄以至全县，许多外出生产的农民皆返回参加斗争。目前运动已走向高潮。浮山河底村干部包庇地主，此次在区干部帮助下改善了干部与群众间的关系，运动便蓬勃发展起来。其他如韩村、赵家碾、赵村等村干部与群众间通过“医伤会”，互相检讨后，全县运动再起。
