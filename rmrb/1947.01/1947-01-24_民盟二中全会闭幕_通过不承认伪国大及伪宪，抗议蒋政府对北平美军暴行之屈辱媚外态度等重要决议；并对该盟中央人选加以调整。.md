Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 21st: According to a delayed report from Shanghai: The Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic League, which began on the 6th of this month in Shanghai, closed on the 10th. Attendees included Chairman of the Democratic League Zhang Lan, Central Committee members Shen Junru, Zhang Dongsun, Luo Longji, Deng Chumin, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Shi Liang, and representatives from various local branches, totaling several dozen people. The political report, exceeding 16,000 characters, extensively outlined the Democratic League's consistent policy of striving for peace and democracy, as well as the Democratic League's insistence on the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and the Kuomintang's tearing up of the PCC agreements. The meeting also passed the following important resolutions:

1.  The Democratic League does not recognize the "National Assembly" and "Constitution" that violate the PCC agreements and will continue to strive for the realization of the PCC resolutions.
2.  The Democratic League will actively participate in local autonomy work. Whether in the Liberated Areas or the government-controlled areas, if local conditions permit, members will participate in autonomous organizations, including local governments and representative bodies at all levels below a province or several provinces, but will not participate in the divisive central government.
3.  Luo Longji and Shi Liang were tasked with drafting the Democratic League's protest letter, condemning the Chiang government's humiliating and pro-foreign attitude towards the U.S. military atrocities in Beiping.
4.  To commemorate Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, and other Democratic League martyrs, it was decided that July 15th would be designated as the Democratic League Martyrs' Memorial Day, and the Kuomintang government was once again requested to severely punish the perpetrators and be responsible for compensating for the losses.
5.  The facts of Democratic League members being persecuted by Kuomintang secret agents in various regions were compiled to submit a general protest to the Kuomintang government.
6.  The "Implementation Measures for Adjusting Party Relations within the League" were abolished. From now on, all League members will join the League solely in their individual capacities.
7.  The connection between the Democratic League's central and local organizations will be strengthened, and a Southwest General Branch, including the four provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou, will be established.
8.  A "Political Planning Committee" will be established.
9.  It was decided to convene the Second National Congress in June of this year.
