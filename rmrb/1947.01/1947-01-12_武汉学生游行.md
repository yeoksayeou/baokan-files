　　Wuhan Students' Parade
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, over 5,000 students in Wuhan held a demonstration parade on the 5th to protest against the atrocities of the U.S. military. Participants included students from Wuhan University, Central China University, Hubei Provincial Medical College, Wuchang Art College, Fuwen Middle School, and Anhui Middle School. At 9 a.m., the large group departed from Dongchangkou in Wuchang, passing through major thoroughfares in Wuchang and Hankou. The citizens along the way were enthusiastic and supportive. The parade dispersed at 4 p.m. The students demanded that the U.S. military criminals be severely punished and tried by Chinese military courts, that losses be compensated, that the U.S. authorities immediately issue a public apology, that all U.S. troops stationed in China be immediately and unconditionally withdrawn, that the civil war be stopped, and that the government adopt an independent and autonomous foreign policy. Chinese, British, and American professors at Central China University in Wuchang unanimously supported the students' protest against the actions of the U.S. military, believing that to prevent similar incidents from continuing, U.S. troops should withdraw from China, and the U.S. military criminals should be judged by Chinese law. If the government and the U.S. authorities do not provide a reasonable solution, further opposition actions should be taken.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Nanjing News: After holding a parade to protest against the atrocities of the U.S. military, students from various universities in Nanjing published a "Letter to the American People," calling on the American people to urge their government to withdraw all U.S. troops stationed in China. It stated: "The actions of the U.S. military in China have aroused the anger of all Chinese people. The actions of the U.S. military are a great disgrace to the United States, and their barbaric actions are an irreparable loss to the American people who love democracy. American people, do not support violence that oppresses other nations! You should urge your government to withdraw all U.S. troops stationed in China! All actions of the U.S. military in China will destroy the friendship between the people of the two countries and threaten world peace."

　　武汉学生游行
    【新华社延安十日电】据天津大公报消息：武汉学生五日五千余人的抗议美军暴行示威游行，参加者有武汉大学、华中大学、鄂省立医学院、武昌艺专及傅文中学、安徽中学等校学生。晨九时大队由武昌东厂口出发，经过武昌、汉口各通衢要道，沿途市民情绪慷慨热烈，迄下午四时始散。学生之要求为严惩美军凶犯，由中国军事法厅审判。赔偿损失，美国当局立即公开道歉，驻华美军立即全部无条件撤退，停止内战，政府应采取独立自主的外交政策。武昌华中大学中国与英美籍教授，对学生抗议美军行动，一致声援，认为欲避免此类事件继续发生，美军自应撤出中国，行凶美军当以中国法律裁判，若政府及美国当局不作合理解决，即应采取进一步之反对行动。
    【新华社延安八日电】南京讯：南京各大学学生在举行抗议美军暴行游行之后，曾发表一封《告美国人民书》，呼吁美国人民督促其政府撤退驻华一切美军。内称：“美军在中国的行动已引起全体中国人民的愤怒，美军的行动是美国莫大的耻辱，他们的蛮横行动是对于爱好民主的美国人民之不可补偿的损失；美国人民，你们不要拥护压迫其他民族的暴力！应当督促你们的政府撤退驻华一切美军！美军在中国的一切行动，将会破坏两国人民之间的友谊，并威胁世界和平”。
