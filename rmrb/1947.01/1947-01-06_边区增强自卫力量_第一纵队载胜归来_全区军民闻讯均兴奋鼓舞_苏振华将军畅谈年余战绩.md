Border Region Strengthens Self-Defense Forces
    First Column Returns Victoriously
    All Military and Civilians in the Region Excited and Encouraged
    General Su Zhenhua Discusses War Achievements Over the Past Year

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The First Column, a strong force in the border region, was ordered by the Yan'an Headquarters in December of the year before last to go to the Northeast to assist the people of the Northeast in quickly eliminating local bandits and all lurking remnants of the Japanese and puppet regimes, and to help the broad masses of the Northeast to liberate themselves as soon as possible. After more than a year of fighting, it has recently returned victoriously to the border region. When the news came, all the military and civilians in the region were excited and encouraged. Yesterday, the reporter went to visit General Su Zhenhua, commander and political commissar of the First Column. General Su, wearing a gray-green military uniform, was in high spirits. Although he had been marching for more than half a month and only arrived here last night, he still showed no signs of fatigue. After paying my respects to General Su and wishing him a safe journey, I immediately asked about the column's expedition over the past year. General Su smiled and said to the reporter: "The First Column, after the Ping-Han Campaign the year before last, was ordered to go to the Northeast to assist the people of the Northeast in their liberation war. However, when our main force reached the border of Liaoning, the ceasefire order had already been announced, and we were ordered to move to Rehe to assist the local armed forces in protecting law and order. After the civil war continued to expand last August, we were ordered to go to the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. Until this time when we were ordered to return, we had been away from the border region for more than a year. During this year, our main force fought in the liberated areas of southern Hebei, central Hebei, eastern Hebei, eastern Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning, Rehe, and Jin-Cha-Ji, traveling more than 7,000 li back and forth. We participated in two major battles, one was the battle to liberate Zunhua in eastern Hebei, and the other was the defense of Zhangjiakou. In the battle of Zunhua in eastern Hebei, our main force captured the city in one fell swoop, eliminating more than 3,000 puppet security troops; in the Zhangjiakou defense battle, our main force also annihilated a total of three regiments of the Kuomintang army's 16th Army and 92nd Army on the flank of the Huailai front. Because the troops are often on the march, the soldiers are generally quite tired; especially when stationed in Rehe, because the local people have been cruelly exploited by the enemy for thirteen years, their lives are extremely poor, which has added a lot of difficulties to the supply of the troops, so that the soldiers cannot eat enough oil, salt, and vegetables, have no sturdy shoes to wear, and lack firewood. However, thanks to the concerted efforts of all commanders and fighters to carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle of the Eighth Route Army and strictly practice production and thrift, not only have all difficulties been overcome and the supply of the troops has been guaranteed; but also the local people have been helped in their emancipation movement, so that hundreds of thousands of poor people have been allocated nearly 100,000 mu of land. And after this exercise, the troops have achieved great success in political work, military-civilian relations, and combat effectiveness, and are even stronger than before." Regarding the order to return to the border region this time, General Su said: "The morale of all commanders and fighters is extremely high. Because more than 70% of the commanders and fighters of the First Column are from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, they were already extremely angry when they heard the news that Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale invasion of their hometown of Hebei-Shandong-Henan last August. Later, after the news of the five victories in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area reached our main force, the soldiers felt extremely excited and encouraged on the one hand; but on the other hand, they often felt uneasy because they could not fight alongside other troops in the border region to fight the Kuomintang army to protect their own hometown, and deeply regretted it. In particular, they were filled with righteous indignation at the atrocities of the Kuomintang army in the occupied areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and often hated not being able to avenge their fathers and brothers themselves. Therefore, this time when we were ordered to return, all commanders and fighters were a hundred times more invigorated, and everyone was determined to inflict heavy losses on Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime, and to use the victory of the battle to protect the border region and protect their own hometown, and vowed not to stop until the Kuomintang army was defeated." Regarding the future war situation in the border region, General Su said: "We firmly believe that the self-defense war in the border region will achieve even greater victories in the future. As for the First Column, under the wise leadership of the leaders of the military region, Liu and Deng, it will also achieve significant results in the future. Because: First, there is the wise leadership of Liu and Deng; second, there are the victorious troops with rich combat experience who have gone through five battles; third, there is the support of the broad masses of emancipated people in Hebei-Shandong-Henan and southern Hebei who have been tempered by war; therefore, all commanders and fighters of the entire column are full of confidence in victory. If the Kuomintang army dares to continue its northward invasion, we have the confidence to wipe it out cleanly and thoroughly." Finally, General Su also said modestly: "We feel very ashamed that we did not bring greater victories to the people of the border region this time, and we have failed everyone's expectations. However, we are determined to repay the concern of the people of the entire region with future victories. At the same time, we hope that all the masses and troops will help us and correct some of the shortcomings that still exist in our troops." Note: The First Column is the main force of the regular army in the border region. It created brilliant achievements in the Ping-Han Campaign the year before last and is still admired by the people of the entire region. This return to the border region will definitely play a major role in the future war situation in the border region.

    边区增强自卫力量
    第一纵队载胜归来
    全区军民闻讯均兴奋鼓舞
    苏振华将军畅谈年余战绩
    【本报特讯】边区劲旅第一纵队，在前年十二月间，为了援助东北人民迅速肃清当地胡匪，及一切潜伏的日伪残余势力，帮助东北广大群众早日翻身，奉延安总部命令开赴东北。转战一年有余，已于最近胜利返回边区。消息传来，全区军民无不兴奋鼓舞。记者特于昨日前往走访一纵队司令员兼政委苏振华将军。苏将军身着灰泥军装，精神焕发，虽经半个多月的长途行军，于昨晚始抵达此间，仍毫无倦容。记者于向苏将军致敬并祝旅安后，当即叩询该纵队一年来的远征情形、苏将军含笑对记者说：“一纵队于前年平汉战役结束后，奉命开往东北，帮助东北人民的解放战争，但当本部进抵辽宁边境时，停战命令业已公布，乃奉命移驻热河，协助当地武装保卫治安。去年八月内战继续扩大后，又奉命开抵晋察冀边区。直至此次奉命归来，离开边区已一年有余。在此一年中，本部转战冀南、冀中、冀东、冀热辽、热河、晋察冀等解放区，往返跋涉七千余里，较大的战斗参加了两次，一次是解放冀东遵化之战，另一次是张家口的保卫战。冀东遵化之战，本部一举将该城攻克，消灭伪治安军三千余人；张家口保卫战中，本部在怀来前线侧翼，先后亦歼灭蒋军十六军及九十二军共达三团之众。因为部队经常在行军中，战士们一般的说是相当疲劳的；尤其是在热河驻防时，因该地群众经过敌人十三年来的残酷压榨，生活异常穷困，这样，就给部队的供给增加了不少困难，使战士们不能吃到足够的油、盐和蔬菜，没有结实的鞋子穿，缺乏柴烧。但是，由于全体指战员一致发扬了八路军艰苦奋斗的优良传统，厉行生产节约的结果，不仅克服了一切困难、保证了部队的供给；并且还帮助了当地人民的翻身运动，使十几万贫苦的群众，分到了将近十万亩的土地。而部队经过了这次锻炼，无论在政治工作、军民关系以及战斗力方面，都获得了极大的成绩，较前更加坚强了。”对于此次奉令返回边区，苏将军说：“全体指战员的情绪，都是异常高涨的。因为一纵队的指战员，百分之七十以上都是冀鲁豫区的人，他们在去年八月间，听到蒋介石大举进犯冀鲁豫他们的故乡的消息时，早已气愤的了不得。以后，冀鲁豫区五战五捷，胜利消息传到本部后，战士们一方面感到了异常的兴奋与鼓舞；但另一方面，却因不能与边区其他部队并肩作战，为保卫他们自己的家乡来和蒋军拚命，而经常感到不安，深以为憾。特别是，对于蒋军在冀鲁豫侵占区的暴行，更是义愤填胸，常恨不能亲身为自己的父兄报仇雪恨。因此，此次奉命归来，全体指战员莫不百倍振奋，大家都决心要痛创蒋伪，以战斗的胜利，来保卫边区，保卫他们自己的家乡，不把蒋军打垮，誓不休止。”对于今后边区的战局，苏将军说：“我们坚决相信，边区的自卫战争今后一定会获得更大的胜利。至于一纵队，在军区刘、邓首长的英明领导下，今后也会获得重大的成绩。因为：第一、有刘、邓首长的英明领导；第二，有经过五次战役富有战斗经验的胜利部队配合；第三，有经过战争锻炼的冀鲁豫、冀南广大翻身群众的支援；所以，全纵队的指战员都充满了胜利信心。如果，蒋军胆敢继续北犯，我们是有信心，把它干净、彻底消灭光的。”最后，苏将军并谦虚的说：“我们这次回到边区来，没有给边区人民带来更大的胜利，我们感到非常惭愧，有负大家的厚望。但，我们决心以今后的胜利，来报答全区人民对我们的关怀。同时，我们更希望所有的群众和部队来帮助我们，纠正我们部队尚存在的一些缺点。”按：一纵队系边区正规军主力，在前年平汉战役中，曾创建辉煌战功，至今犹为全区人民所敬仰。此次返回边区，对于边区今后战局，定会起重大的作用。
