[Taiyue, 12th dispatch] In Qinxian County, the mass movement has vigorously unfolded, penetrating deep into the mountain villages in the past half-month. There are two main key points: First, the fruits of struggle were redistributed, encouraging the broad masses to participate in the movement. In the ten or so villages belonging to the Jiaokou base point, previously, when the fruits of struggle were distributed according to the issue, participants were limited to those with accounts to settle and activists. After redistribution, in Wang Wanyi Village alone, the number of participants in the struggle increased from 71 households to 170 households, an unprecedented scale, with struggle continuing day and night. Second, through a large-scale "turning over" inspection and the promotion of the "land to the tiller" policy, already liberated households were mobilized to encourage not-yet-liberated households to rise up and struggle, quickly mobilizing the masses in the entire village. Other backward villages and mountain hamlets, such as Wangjiazhuang Village, which includes 40 small villages like Xin, Nanposhang, Xizhan, and the Shendazhai ditch in Nanzhan, have also been drawn into the struggle under the slogans of "cadres entering mountain villages" and "already liberated villages helping not-yet-liberated villages." In Baijiagou, every household held "turning over" inspection meetings. Some men obtained land, but their women had no clothes to wear, saying they were not yet liberated. Some men had poured out all their grievances, but the women's grievances were not yet exhausted, and they demanded to pour them out again. After the large-scale inspection, more than 70 households re-participated in the grievance-airing movement. After inspection, half of the villages in the Seventh District have also launched a new high tide of reckoning. (Tian Zong)

　　沁县干部深入山沟检查翻身高潮再起
    【本报太岳十二日电】沁县半月来群众运动深入山沟猛烈展开。主要关键有二：一是斗争果实打乱分配，鼓舞了广大群众参加运动。交口基点所属十余村庄，以前按问题分配斗争果实时，参加者仅限于有账可算者与积极分子。经打乱分配后，仅王万一村参加斗争者即由七十一户增至一百七十户，规模空前浩大，白天黑夜斗争不息。一是经过翻身大检查，宣传耕者有其田政策，发动已翻身户动员未翻身户起来斗争，很快把全村群众发动起来。其他落后村与山庄窝铺，如包括四十个小庄的王家庄村新、南坡上、西站、南站深大寨沟等村，在“干部入山沟”“已翻身村帮助未翻身村”口号下，也都卷入斗争。百家沟在翻身检查中，家家开翻身检查会，有的男人得到土地，女人没有衣裳穿，说自己还未翻身。有的男人诉尽了苦，但女的苦水还未倒尽，即要求再诉苦。大检查后有七十余户重新参加诉苦运动。七区的半数村庄经过检查以后，也都掀起新的清算高潮。（天纵）
