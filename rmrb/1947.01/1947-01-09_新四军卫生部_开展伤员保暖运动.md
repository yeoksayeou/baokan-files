Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th. The Health Department of a certain unit of the New Fourth Army is enthusiastically launching a "Movement to Keep Wounded Soldiers Warm on the Battlefield," overcoming various difficulties to ensure that the wounded are warmly clothed, well-fed, traveling comfortably, and sleeping soundly. The department has established a Warmth Preservation Committee to specifically supervise and promote the movement. The department already has several types of field warming equipment: 1. Warm Sheds. When wounded soldiers arrive at the camp, all staff members work together to build warm sheds, surrounding them with reeds, covering the top with a layer of reeds and then scattering wheat straw to prevent frost and snow from penetrating. Brick tower-shaped stoves are built to provide wounded soldiers with food, water, and maintain the temperature inside the shed. 2. Warm Trenches. Two trenches are dug outside the operating room, traversing the entire room from the corner of the wall. The trenches are covered with tinplate as an outer wall. When charcoal is burned, the hot smoke traverses the trenches. A pot of water is placed on the inner wall to provide wounded soldiers with drinking water and for use by operating room personnel. 3. Warm Operating Beds. Six to eight kerosene cans are filled with boiling water, and door panels are used under the cans to make them the same height as the table. Cotton yarn is laid on top of the cans, and wounded soldiers are placed on top during surgery to achieve appropriate warmth. 4. Warm Bricks. Bricks are burned red and then soaked in hot water, then wrapped in soft straw and placed in the wounded soldiers' bedding, which can maintain heat for six to eight hours. In addition, when wounded soldiers are being transferred, special personnel are assigned to provide them with drinking water at each station.

    开展伤员保暖运动
    【新华社华中六日电】新四军某部卫生部，正热烈展开“战场伤员保暖运动”，克服各种困难，使伤员们穿得暖吃得暖行得暖睡得暖。该部已设立保暖委员会，专门督促推动保暖运动。该部已有数种战地保暖设备：一、暖棚。伤员到达棚地宿营时，由全体工作人员自己动手搭好暖棚，四周围以芦苇，顶上铺一层芦苇再散铺麦草，防止霜雪侵袭。并以砖砌成塔形火炉，供给伤员饭菜开水，保持棚内温度。二、暖沟。于手术室外挖两条沟，从墙角横贯全室，沟上盖以洋铁皮当外壁，烧起木炭时热烟横贯，里壁则置一锅子烧水，供伤员喝开水及手术室人员之用。三、开刀暖床。以六个到八个火油箱装满开水，箱底下用门板使与桌子高度相等，箱上加铺棉纱，伤员动手术时搁在上面，取得适当暖和。四、暖砖。将砖块烧红后浸以热水，再用软草包好，放在伤员被窝内，可以保持六至八小时的热度。此外当伤员转动时，派专人负责按站供给伤员开水。
