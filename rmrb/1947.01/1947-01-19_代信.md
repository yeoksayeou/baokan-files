　　Letter on Behalf
    To Jia Mazhuang'er, Magnetic Wu Middle Squad: Did you receive the letter and the shoes I sent you earlier? As the New Year approaches, your mother and I are both very happy. The village respects us highly everywhere. After the liberation, our family was allocated three mu of ditch land and half of a courtyard on the street. Your mother was also given a weaving machine. We milled two dou of wheat the day before yesterday, so we can have a good New Year this year. Don't worry about the family, just focus on fighting Chiang [Kai-shek] for us. If you have time, please write a letter. Wishing you strength!
    Father, Jia Derang

    磁武中队贾马庄儿：前去一信和捎的鞋，收到没有？刻下过年，我和你妈都高兴。村上处处高看咱，翻身中咱家又分了三亩沟道地和上街半串院，还分给你妈一架织布机子；前天磨了二斗麦子，今年的年可过好了。家里你不用结记，好好给咱打蒋就是了。你有工夫，望写封信来。祝你健壮！
