　　The Central Bureau and Military Region Warmly Celebrate the New Year with a Grand Gathering of 5,000 People.
    Deputy Commander Teng calls on the military and civilians to strengthen combat and training, universally implement Chairman Mao's mass line throughout the army, and prepare for a full-scale counter-offensive.
    [Our Special Dispatch] On the morning of New Year's Day, the golden rays of the sun illuminated the gathering place for the New Year's greetings from the directly subordinate organizations of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and Military Region. More than 5,000 cadres and soldiers, under a huge portrait of Chairman Mao with the words "Advance under the banner of Mao Zedong and accomplish the combat tasks of 1947," raised a bright and dazzling national flag, symbolizing the inevitable victory of the Chinese people in the new year and the infinite brightness of the future.
    After three cannon salutes, the entire venue, in solemn singing, paid New Year's respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and to leaders Liu, Deng, Bo, Teng, Zhang, and Li who led the self-defense operations in the entire region, and then each unit paid New Year's respects to each other.
    Amidst thunderous applause, Military Region Deputy Commander Teng, on behalf of the military and civilians of the entire region, announced the great victory of our army in recovering the two cities of Liaocheng and Juye on New Year's Eve (December 31st) as a gift to welcome the new year of 1947. Following this, Deputy Commander Teng, after analyzing the national political and military situation over the past year and the glorious victories of our army's self-defense operations, called on the military and civilians of the entire region to combine with land reform and the large-scale production movement to carry out the following tasks: (1) Strengthen combat, welcome new battles, and prepare for a full-scale counter-offensive; (2) Launch a mass-based training movement to rapidly improve the combat effectiveness of the troops and catch up with the needs of combat; (3) Universally implement Chairman Mao's mass line in the army; (4) Strengthen the construction work of the people's army (the full text of the speech will be published on page two). Subsequently, Secretary Wang of the Central Bureau Office read out the New Year's message on behalf of Comrade Bo Yibo (the full text will be published in this newspaper on January 1st).
    Deputy Commander Teng led the entire venue in reciting the New Year's oath: "...We voluntarily dedicate ourselves to the patriotic self-defense war. 1947 has brought us new combat tasks. We must advance more bravely and resolutely under the banner of Mao Zedong, resolutely struggle, serve the people, overcome all difficulties, strictly abide by discipline, obey orders, unite and help each other, improve technology, win every battle, resolutely launch a counter-offensive, wipe out the invading Chiang troops completely, recover all lost territories, and thoroughly realize China's independence, democracy, and peace."
    Finally, the meeting adjourned amidst thunderous slogans such as "Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's operational principles, thoroughly eliminate the enemy's effective strength! Intensify work, training, and study, fully support the front lines, thoroughly implement land reform, launch a large-scale production movement, long live the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" In the afternoon at 4 o'clock, the Central Bureau, the Border Region Government, and the Military Region jointly hosted responsible comrades from various directly subordinate organizations. The guests and hosts were extremely happy during the banquet.
