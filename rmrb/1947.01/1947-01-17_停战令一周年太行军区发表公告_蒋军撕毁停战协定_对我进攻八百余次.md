　　[Our newspaper Changzhi 15th dispatch] The Taihang Military Region issued an announcement on the anniversary of the ceasefire order, stating: When the ceasefire agreement was announced last year, the military and civilians in our region were all delighted, believing that peace could be achieved. All commanders and fighters of our main forces and local forces, as well as all militiamen, strictly obeyed Chairman Mao's orders and the orders issued by the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, staying in their original positions and awaiting mediation, vowing to fight for the implementation of this order. Before receiving the order on the 13th, our army was launching a counter-attack with indignation against the Chiang army that had unreasonably occupied our Hui County and Xiuwu areas. When the ceasefire order reached the front line, our counter-attacking troops in Xiuwu had bravely climbed the city and were about to capture the city and annihilate the enemy; however, in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement time, they immediately and painfully withdrew. At that time, the people of Xiuwu who were serving with the army on the front line all cried bitterly because they could not return to their hometowns. Unexpectedly, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek openly ordered a ceasefire on one hand, and secretly ordered his troops to attack our area on the other. The Chiang army in Mengjin secretly crossed the Yellow River at 12:00 noon on the 13th after the agreement came into effect, attacking Meng County. The Shanxi Yan army Zhao Chengshui's troops also colluded with the Japanese and puppet troops to move south along the East Qin Line in a large scale after the agreement came into effect, attempting to peep at Shangdang again: while the Chiang Yan puppet troops and traitor armed "Homecoming Corps" and so on, along the Yubei, Shijiazhuang, Zhengtai, and Tongpu lines still unscrupulously attacked and harassed the border areas of our region, burning, killing and looting. This caused more than a dozen cases such as the Qingxiu massacre caused by the puppet army Duan Bingchang's troops in Qin County in June last year, and the Nansucun massacre of Yuanshi people by the puppet army Wei Yonghe's troops in Yuanshi in July. In total, in the year after the ceasefire order, the Chiang army launched 810 large and small breaches of contract against the Taihang Liberated Area, including 8 large-scale attacks using forces from one brigade to five brigades, occupying 17 towns and cities, covering an area of 11,620 square li. The facts over the past year have proven that the ceasefire agreement has been completely torn up by the Chiang army since it took effect, and Chiang Kai-shek's so-called ceasefire and the US-Chiang's so-called mediation are merely deceiving the Chinese people in order to achieve the internal war conspiracy of selling the country and dictatorship.

　　停战令一周年太行军区发表公告
    蒋军撕毁停战协定  对我进攻八百余次
    【本报长治十五日电】太行军区于停战令一周年发表公告称：去年停战协定公布，我区军民莫不欢欣鼓舞，认为和平当可实现。我全体主力部队、地方部队的指战员及全体民兵均恪遵毛主席命令及北平军事调处执行部签发的命令，停留原位置静待调处，誓为执行此令而奋斗。十三日接获命令前，我军正以愤懑心情，向无理侵据我辉县，修武等地之蒋军反攻，当停战令到达前线时，我反攻修武部队已奋勇登城，克城歼敌只在眉捷；但为遵守停战协定时间，当即忍痛后撤。当时在前线随军服务的修武人民，均以不能返回家乡抱头痛哭。不意卖国贼蒋介石竟一面明令停战，一面即密令其部队向我区进攻，孟津蒋军于十三日下午十二时协定生效之后，竟然偷渡黄河，袭我孟县；山西阎军赵承绥部亦协同日、伪军于协定生效后沿东沁线大举南下，企图再窥上党：而豫北、石家庄、正太、同蒲沿线的蒋阎伪军及奸特武装“还乡团”等，仍肆无忌惮向我区边地进攻袭扰，烧杀掠夺。造成去年六月沁县伪军段炳昌部一手造成的青修惨案，七月元氏伪军魏永和部屠杀元氏人民的南苏村惨案等十数件。总计停战令后一年来，蒋军对我太行解放区的违约进攻大小凡八百十次，其中使用兵力在一个旅至五个旅的大举进攻凡八次，占我城镇十七座，面积达万一千六百二十平方华里，一年来事实证明：停战协定自其生效之日起即已被蒋军完全撕毁，蒋介石的所谓停战与美蒋的所谓调处，仅在欺骗国人以借达卖国独裁的内战阴谋。
