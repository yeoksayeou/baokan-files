Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 30th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on Leighton Stuart's speech in Tianjin on the 27th, stating:

    Just as the Chiang Kai-shek's National Assembly was ending its farcical show, Stuart publicly came out in his capacity as the U.S. Ambassador to cheer it on, claiming that the resolutions on the administration of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) passed in the "National Assembly" comedy were "particularly democratic." He further, in his capacity as the U.S. Ambassador, called on the "Chinese people to assist the government" to "promote the implementation of this unprecedented 'constitutional' model." This precisely exposed that this so-called U.S. mediator, like his superior Truman's statement on the 18th, is openly interfering in China's internal affairs. It once again proves that the U.S. imperialists are truly the stage managers of Chiang's National Assembly and the behind-the-scenes string-pullers of the dictatorial constitution. Mr. Stuart's energetic advertising and promotion for the dictatorship of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families, even praising it as a "good omen for a happy China," stems from the same source as Washington's protection of Franco and MacArthur's favoritism towards Yoshida. U.S. imperialism has always regarded any product with a fascist flavor as a "good omen" for Wall Street. Therefore, when the Chinese people see through that this monkey show of the so-called "National Assembly" and the pseudo-constitution not only tore up the PCC resolutions, but even some Kuomintang members who participated in drafting this dog-skin plaster had to publicly admit that this "constitution" is nothing more than a reactionary and dictatorial "May 5th Draft" in disguise, Stuart immediately came out to defend this pseudo-constitution, which is itself full of dictatorial elements, in a desperate attempt to disguise Chiang's traitorous and dictatorial government as a flowery "democratic constitutional" government, in order to further obtain a "legitimate" basis for the U.S. imperialist reactionary policy of aiding Chiang.

    Stuart's speech fully revealed the intentions of the U.S. imperialists he represents. He advocated an aggressive and proactive attitude, and therefore the Associated Press had already reported on the 24th that the United States would provide Chiang with a 500 million yuan loan in the spring. In this way, Chiang Kai-shek, whom he praised as having "forward courage," can be more "aggressive and proactive" in launching a civil war without restraint. However, the Chinese people, after seeing through the ambitions of U.S. imperialism and understanding the essence of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial betrayal, will use a hundredfold "aggressive and proactive attitude" to crush the military offensive of Chiang Kai-shek, supported by U.S. imperialism, and achieve the goal of completely abolishing the "constitution" "passed" by Chiang's "National Assembly." Although Dr. Stuart was "born and raised in this land," he is not very familiar with Chinese history, so much so that he considers Chiang's pseudo-constitution to be "unprecedented." But the Chinese people will certainly make this ill omen of Chiang, the arch-disaster, follow its historical precedents, Yuan Shikai's Temple of Heaven Constitution and Cao Kun's Piglet Constitution, into oblivion.

### 美大使为伪国大捧场  公开干涉中国内政  新华社记者评司徒雷登谈话

　　美大使为伪国大捧场
    公开干涉中国内政
    新华社记者评司徒雷登谈话
    【新华社延安十二月三十日电】新华社记者评司徒雷登氏二十七日在天津发表之谈话称：
    蒋记国大刚刚锣鼓散场，司徒氏即以美国大使姿态公开出来捧场，称“国大”滑稽丑剧中通过的所施行政协决议，尤具民主精神”，并以美国大使身份出来号召“中国人民协助政府”去“促成此史无前谓宪法为“例之宪法见诸实施”，恰恰暴露了这位所谓美方调人是和他的上司杜鲁门的十八日声明一样，在公开干涉中国内政。又一次证明了，美帝国主义者真正是蒋记国大的舞台监督和独裁宪法的幕后牵线人。司徒先生如此替蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族的独裁广告卖力吹嘘，甚至誉之为“幸福的中国之吉兆”，是和华盛顿的包庇佛朗哥、麦克阿瑟之宠爱吉田同一渊源。美帝国主义对一切具有法西斯气味的产品，素来是认作华尔街的“吉兆”的，所以当中国人民看透了这猴子戏的所谓“国大”和伪宪不但是撕毁了政协决议，甚至当参加了制定这狗皮膏药的某些国民党员也不得不公开承认这“宪法”是反动独裁的五五宪草的换汤不换药的时候，司徒雷登就立刻出来，为这个条文本身已充满了独裁气息的伪宪做声嘶力竭的辩护，企图把蒋记卖国独裁政府打扮成一个花枝招展的“民主宪法”政府，以便进一步替美帝国主义反动的援蒋政策取得“合法”的根据。
    司徒的谈话和盘托出了他所代表的美帝国主义者的意图。他力主进取与积极的态度，因而合众社二十四日早就传出美国将于明春通过五亿元对蒋借款的消息。这样他所嘉奖为具有“向前勇气”的蒋介石，就可以更加“进取与积极”的放手大打内战。但是，中国人民在看透了美帝国主义的野心和熟知蒋介石独裁卖国实质之余，将以千百倍的“进取与积极的态度”，粉碎美帝国主义支援的蒋介石的军事进攻，而达到彻底取消蒋记“国大”所“通过”的“宪法”的目的。司徒博士虽然是“生于斯土，长于斯土”；但对中国历史毕竟不太熟悉，以至认为蒋记伪宪是“史无前例”。但中国人民一定会使这一蒋总灾的凶兆，跟踪它的历史前例袁世凯天坛宪法和曹锟猪仔宪法一起葬送。
