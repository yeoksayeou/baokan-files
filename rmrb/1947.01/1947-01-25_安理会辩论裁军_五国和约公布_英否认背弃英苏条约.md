Xinhua News Agency, dispatches from January 17th to 23rd: Three relatively important international developments recently:

    First, the Security Council debated disarmament and atomic energy control again on the 15th and 16th. The US representative demanded that the Atomic Energy Commission's report be discussed first, with the aim of using it to undermine the substance of disarmament. However, this was opposed by most representatives, with only the British representative supporting his trickery. On the 16th, the US representative suddenly proposed that "any suggestions should be postponed for discussion until February 4th," ostensibly to allow the new US Secretary of State to participate, but in reality, to use this delay for secret negotiations, haggling with the Soviet Union and other countries. The Security Council scheduled a vote on this issue for the 17th.

    Second, the full texts of the five-nation peace treaties were simultaneously published in the capitals of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the 17th, and are scheduled to be signed in Paris on February 10th. The signatory countries and effective dates for each treaty are stipulated as follows: (1) Treaty with Italy, signatory countries [left blank in original], effective date after the deposit of instruments of ratification by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. (2) Treaty with Romania, signatory countries eleven, effective date after the deposit of instruments of ratification by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. (3) Treaty with Bulgaria, signatory countries twelve, effective date after the deposit of instruments of ratification by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. (4) Treaty with Hungary, signatory countries twelve, effective date after the deposit of instruments of ratification by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. (5) Treaty with Finland, signatory countries ten, effective date after the deposit of instruments of ratification by the Soviet Union and Britain.

    Third, Anglo-Soviet relations. After Pravda commented on Bevin's abandonment of the Anglo-Soviet treaty on the 15th, the British Foreign Office officially denied it on the 19th, and notified the Soviet Union that "Britain does not believe that the United Nations Charter has replaced the Treaty of Alliance signed in 1942." However, on the other hand, many Labour Party members of parliament criticized Bevin on the 18th, saying that "the recent seemingly cordial Anglo-Soviet relations are a facade," and prepared to launch an attack on the British government's diplomacy after the British Parliament reconvenes on the 21st, citing the agreement between the British and American air forces to exchange personnel intelligence as evidence.

### 安理会辩论裁军  五国和约公布  英否认背弃英苏条约

　　安理会辩论裁军
    五国和约公布
    英否认背弃英苏条约
    【本报综合报道】据新华社十七日至二十三日电讯：最近来国际间关系有下列三件比较重要的事：
    第一、安理会于十五、十六两日，再次辩论裁军与原子能管制，美代表要求先讨论原子能委员会的报告，目的是要用它来破坏裁军的实质，然而遭到了大多数代表的反对，仅仅英国代表支持他耍赖。十六日美方代表又突然提出：“无论任何建议，要延至二月四日讨论”，表面理由是让美新国务卿有参加意见的机会，实际上想借这个拖延的时间，进行秘密谈判，向苏联及其他国家讨价还价。安理会定十七日表决这个问题。
    第二是五国和约全文已于十七日由苏美英法首都同时发表，定于二月十日在巴黎签字，各和约之签字国及生效日期规定为：（一）对意和约，签字国××国，生效时期苏、美、英、法批准书存卷之后。（二）对罗和约，签字国十一国，生效时间苏、美、英三国批准书存卷之后。（三）对保和约签字者十二国，生效期为苏、美、英三国批准书存卷之后。（四）对匈和约签字者十二国，生效期为苏、美、英三国批准书存卷之后。（五）对芬和约，签字者十国，生效期为苏、英两国批准书存卷之后。
    第三是英苏关系。自从真理报于十五日评论贝文背弃英苏条约后，十九日英外交部正式否认。并通知苏联称：“英国不认为联合国宪章，已代替一九四二年签订之同盟条约”。但另一方面许多工党议员于十八日指责贝文说：“最近英苏关系的比较亲热，是一种伪饰”，准备在二十一号英国会复会后，发动对英政府外交的抨击，并列举英国空军与美国空军交换人事情报的协定等为证据。
