　　[Report from our Jiluyu office on the 11th] The Finance Office of our district has issued a circular commending Yang Youqing, the model in economic work and chief of the Supply Department of the Fifth Sub-district, calling on all units to learn from the spirit and style of Comrade Yang Youqing. Comrade Yang Youqing previously served as a member of the Jinan Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Committee, then as manager of a cart transportation service, and is now the chief of the Supply Department of the Fifth Sub-district. Comrade Yang has consistently obeyed organizational assignments, completed tasks, worked actively, endured hardship, cherished public property, and united with comrades. Comrade Yang's work has been transferred many times over the years, but each time he happily took up his duties. When the cart transportation service was terminated, the organization offered him two jobs to choose from. He replied, "See what I can do, and where the work is needed, I will go there. Please let the organization decide." Because of his busy work and overwork, Comrade Yang Youqing has coughed up blood several times, but he has never made special requests to the organization. Sometimes, the organization, out of concern for him, actively offered him care, but he always said, "My illness is not serious, it will be fine in a few days," and refused preferential treatment. When searching for enemy and puppet property in the Clearing Committee, he personally dug pits and built concealed walls, working so hard that he was breathless and sweating, but he never boasted about his contributions. When the cart transportation service withdrew from Jinan, a driver ran away on the road, and he personally drove the cart. Sometimes, when the animals could not pull it, he ignored his own fatigue and carried the cart through mud and water, and coordinated efforts to move the public property out with great effort. He took great care of public property, and he felt heartbroken if anything was lost or damaged. After arriving at the cart transportation service, seeing that many animals were sick, he personally checked the feed, checked the methods of use, patiently educated the drivers to cherish the animals, and not to waste feed. Afterwards, he fattened up the animals again. If the vehicles were damaged, he repaired them himself to save repair costs. All comrades who have worked with Comrade Yang Youqing say, "Comrade Yang Youqing has a good temper, is sincere to people, and always tries to help solve difficulties at the lower levels. He is a model cadre."

　　冀鲁豫财办处通令嘉奖
    经济工作模范杨友清
  　一贯听从分配积极工作爱护资财
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】本区财经办事处特通令嘉奖经济工作中的模范——五分区供给处长杨友清同志，号召各单位学习杨友清同志的精神与作风。杨友清同志前任济宁敌伪资财清理委员会委员，后调任马车行经理，现任五分区供给处长。杨同志一贯的能够听从组织分配，完成任务，工作积极，吃苦耐劳，爱护公物，团结友爱。杨同志数年来的工作曾调动很多次，但每次调动都是很愉快的到职工作。这次马车行结束，组织上向他提出两个工作，让他选择，他的回答是：“看着我能干啥，和那里工作需要，我就到那里去，请组织决定吧。”杨友清同志因工作繁忙，劳累过度，吐过好几次血，但从未向组织上提出特殊的要求。有时组织上为了爱护他，主动的给以照顾，他总是说：“我这病不要紧，过几天就好了”而不接受优待。在清委会搜查敌伪资财时，他亲自刨坑打夹皮墙，累得气喘汗流，但从不夸耀自己功劳。马车行从济宁撤出时，路上一个车夫跑了，他亲自赶车。有时牲口拉不动了，他不顾自己的疲劳，在泥里水里扛车，并前后联络，费了很大力气才把公家的东西搬出来。他对公家资财爱护备至，如丢掉或损害一点，他都觉得很心痛，到马车行后，看到牲口多病，他便亲自检查草料，检查使用法，耐心的教育车夫，爱惜牲口，不要浪费草料等，以后把牲口又养肥了。车辆如有损坏，便亲自修理，以节省修理费。凡是和杨友清同志在一块工作过的同志，都说：“杨友清同志好脾气，对人实在，下层有困难总是设法帮助解决，是一个模范干部。”
