    Ji-Lu-Yu Twenty-seventh Dispatch: Land reform in the Seventh Sub-district of Ji-Lu-Yu has taken on a new look due to the meritorious service campaign. After specifically planning the establishment of a merit book and a method of recording merits, a large number of village cadre activist training classes were opened in Wenshang, Jibei, and Nanwang; Wenshang's second and third districts have already begun to break ground, and are actively engaged in struggle, land distribution, and debt recovery. Although Jining is a guerrilla zone, it is now actively carrying out guerrilla warfare and has established guerrilla bases. Under the slogan of "one hand holding a gun, one hand distributing land," it is carrying out land distribution struggles. The work in Kunshan has already found its direction. Dongping and Wenshang's fourth and fifth districts are in the process of distributing land. Now, leaders at all levels are seizing the gaps in the war to organize a larger force to launch the land reform movement.
