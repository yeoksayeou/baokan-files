    The government doesn't belong to de Gaulle.
    The formation of the new French Cabinet is another great victory for the people and will have a significant impact on world peace. Cooperation between peasants and workers, united around the Communist Party, has taken a historic step forward.
    *Liberation Daily* on the Formation of the New French Cabinet

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] *Liberation Daily* today, under the title "The Government Doesn't Belong to de Gaulle," assessed the formation of the new French Cabinet, stating: "Although the composition of this new cabinet is still very disproportionate to the current balance of political forces in France (the French Communist Party is the largest party), there is no doubt that the formation of the new government is another great victory for the French people, following the referendum and parliamentary elections last year, and another great defeat for the French reactionaries led by de Gaulle. It will have a very significant impact on France's future construction, as well as on peace in Europe and the world." "If the Third French Republic was born on the ruins of the failed Paris Commune, then the Fourth French Republic is completely different. It was born on the basis of the unprecedented growth of the French working class and other democratic and progressive forces, which guarantees that it will inevitably have a magnificent and sound future."

    The editorial continued: "De Gaulle, with his resume as a former commander of the French Resistance, could have become a founding leader of the new France if he had followed public opinion, worked diligently, and adapted to the trend. However, he was ultimately limited by his extremely selfish class prejudices and wholeheartedly served as a lackey of the two hundred French monopoly families, especially being directly supported by the Rothschild syndicate. He organized the so-called 'de Gaulle League' and conspired to collude with the Catholic Popular Republican Movement Party, backed by financial groups, and the Republican Liberty Party, supported by large trusts, large banks, and large landowners, brazenly carrying out anti-communist and anti-democratic activities, desperately opposing the new constitution, and sabotaging and obstructing the country's reconstruction work. He also put forward the slogan of 'power belongs to de Gaulle,' attempting to seize the fruits of the French people's four years of bloody struggle and create a traitorous and dictatorial rule. Externally, he colluded with the reactionaries in Britain and especially in the United States, attempting to use figures like Schumann of the Popular Republican Movement Party to trap himself with $1.37 billion or more in American loans, engaging in various acts of betraying the motherland." "However, de Gaulle and his reactionary group have once again suffered a serious blow. In the face of the increasingly awakened and powerful French people, power did not go to de Gaulle. De Gaulle did not become president or prime minister, and the reactionaries' conspiracy to organize a reactionary coalition government excluding the Communist Party or to prevent the Communist Party from holding the most important position of Minister of Defense in the cabinet was completely foiled. The French people will certainly not forget the heroic and strong French Communist Party and the working class. Who doesn't know that the French Communist Party has always stood at the forefront of the resistance movement during the war, played a huge role in the restoration of national production after the war, and made arduous efforts to pass the democratic constitution? It is particularly worth pointing out that the cooperation between the French peasants and the working class has taken a historic step forward. Peasants have truly recognized the Communist Party and workers in the resistance and restoration efforts. A large part of them have united around the Communist Party, fighting for their own interests and for the interests of the motherland!"

    The editorial concluded: "Of course, the French reactionaries still have power; with the secret support of foreign reactionaries, especially American imperialists, the de Gaulle clique will continue to struggle to the death. They still want to beg for help from God and the church, continuing to endure humiliation and betray the French people. Representatives of the Republican Movement Party and other right-wing parties will definitely undermine and disrupt the new government; some upper-level leaders of the Socialist Party will continue to waver. However, the direction of the new France's navigation has been firmly determined." "French Communists and all advanced elements will better strengthen the unity of the working class and further raise the awareness of the broad masses of peasants and the petty bourgeoisie, uniting them around themselves. In this way, the reactionaries will be at their wits' end. The failure of the de Gaulle reactionary group will serve as a warning to all reactionary and traitorous ringleaders!"

    政权不归戴高乐
    法国新阁的组成，是人民又一次大胜利，对世界和平将发生重大影响。农民与工人合作，团结在共产党周围，已迈开了历史性的一大步。
    解放日报论法国新阁的组成
    【新华社延安二十八日电】解放日报本日以“政权不归戴高乐”为题，对法国新阁的组成估价道：“这一新阁的构成，虽然还和今日法国各种实际政治力量的对比很不相称（法共是第一大党），但毫无疑问，新政府的成立是法国人民继去年公民投票与国会选举之后的又一次大胜利，也是以戴高乐为首的法国反动派的又一次大失败，它对法国今后的建设以及欧洲和全世界的和平，都将发生极其重大的影响”。“如果说法兰西第三共和国是在巴黎公社失败的废墟上诞生的，那么法兰西第四共和国便完全不同了，它是在法共和国法工人阶级等民主进步力量空前壮大的基础上诞生的，这就保证了它必然有壮阔健全发展的前途。”
    社论继称：“戴高乐以曾做过法国抗战统帅的履历，如能依顺民意，努力奉公，顺应潮流，那他岂不是新法兰西一位建国的领袖？但他终由其极端自私的阶级成见所局限，一心一意当法国二百独占家族的狗腿子，特别受了罗斯契尔德银团的直接豢养，组织所谓“戴高乐联盟”，并阴谋拉拢由财阀为后台的天主教人民共和运动党和大托拉斯大银行和大地主支持的共和自由党，放肆地进行反共反民主的活动，拚命反对新宪，破坏和阻挠国家的重建工作。他还提出了所谓“政权归于戴高乐”的口号，企图夺取法国人民四年流血斗争的果实，造成卖国独裁的统治。对外他勾结英国的特别是美国的反动派，企图通过人民共和运动党的苏曼之流，将十三亿七千万美元或更多的美国借款套住自己的脖子，作出种种出卖祖国的勾当。”“但是，戴高乐及其反动集团终究再次受到了严重的打击。在日益觉醒与强大的法国人民面前，政权并没有归于戴高乐，戴高乐并没有当成总统或总理，反动派梦想组织共产党在外的反动联合政府或不让共产党担任内阁中最重要的位置国防部长的阴谋都一概落了空。法国人民对于英勇坚强的法国共产党与工人阶级是决然忘不掉的。谁不知道法共在战时始终站在抵抗运动的最前线，在战后对于全国生产的恢复起了巨大的作用，并为通过民主的宪法而作了艰苦的奋斗？特别值得指出：法国的农民与工人阶级的合作，已迈开了历史性的一大步，农民已经在抗战和恢复工作中真正认识了共产党和工人。其中很大一部分且已团结在共产党的周围，为其自身和为祖国的利益而奋斗！”
    社论最后指出：“当然，法国的反动派现在还有力量；在外国反动派特别是美国帝国主义者暗中支持之下，戴高乐辈还会作临死的挣扎。他们还想乞灵于上帝与教会，继续忍辱和出卖法国人民。共和运动党和其他右派的代表，一定会在新政府中拆台捣蛋；社会党的某些上层领袖，还会摇摆。但是，新法兰西航行的方向已经确定不移的了。”“法国共产党人和一切先进分子，将更好的加强工人阶级的团结，更加提高广大农民与小资产阶级的觉悟，团结在自己周围。这样，反动派就将黔驴技穷了。戴高乐反动集团的失败，对一切反动卖国头子将不失为一个殷鉴！”
