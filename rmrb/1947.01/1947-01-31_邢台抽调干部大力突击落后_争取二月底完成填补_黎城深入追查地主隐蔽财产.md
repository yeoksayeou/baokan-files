    【Changzhi Dispatch from this newspaper, 29th】Xingtai is vigorously attacking backward villages, striving to complete filling in the gaps throughout the county by the end of February. After a thorough review of the liberation movement before the new year, 200 villages out of the 256 administrative villages in the county have completed leveling and replenishing. More than 50 backward villages are just beginning. In addition to concentrating most of the cadres in backward villages, county and district leaders have also drawn more than 300 village cadres and activists from advanced villages to form liberation teams to directly help backward villages. Experience has proven that this kind of external assistance is very effective. The district trains the village cadres of backward villages and some activists who have emerged from the movement to serve as the main force in promoting the movement in each village. The above preparatory work was completed before the Lunar New Year, and the movement to attack backwardness is now in full swing. County leaders emphasized: "Backward villages should pay special attention to ideological mobilization. The focus is on solving the land problem. When distributing land, appropriate adjustments should be made to the quality, distance, and labor strength of the land to avoid the recurrence of the phenomenon of leveling in quantity but not in quality." They also called on all cadres and comrades in the liberation team to make every effort to attack and strive to complete the filling in throughout the county by the end of February.
    【Changzhi Dispatch from this newspaper, 29th】The land reform review in Licheng has reached its final stage. In order to completely cut off the feudal remnants, the county is now deeply engaged in excavating the "air-raid shelters" of the landlords. The county has discovered that landlords who have been liquidated universally hide most of their property with relatives, friends, neighbors, and paramours. The masses call these people the landlords' "air-raid shelters." Under the slogan of thoroughly recovering debts of blood and sweat, villages have universally launched a campaign to dig out "air-raid shelters." In the overall bitterness session of the Nanweiquan village checking "whether the feudal remnants have been completely cut off," activist Liang Haichao said: "If you want to completely liberate yourself, you must dig out the landlords' 'air-raid shelters.'" On the 12th of this month, the whole village held a meeting to find "air-raid shelters." Farmer Gao Jigou said: "We have to find the 'air-raid shelters' ourselves." He immediately reported the cattle hidden by his relative Gao Tingbi. Then, veteran Yang Linsen also reported the cotton and packages hidden by landlord Wang Shutian. Zhao Zhuxiu, the chairman of the Women's Rescue Association, reported 10,000 silver dollars that landlord Wang Fuying had deposited in her home. Zi Bao reported three jars of beans he was storing for the landlord. He Changfang exposed that landlord Gao Tingkun had buried five mu of land in Beiweiquan. The masses further realized the cunning of the landlords. Those who were deceived into hiding property became extremely resentful of the landlords after waking up. The district and village cadres immediately proposed: "Let's discuss a way to reward this action." Everyone unanimously decided that those who served as "air-raid shelters" for the landlords should report themselves within two days and be rewarded with half the value of the things they had saved; the poorest households would be rewarded with everything; those who were investigated by various methods would be rewarded with 60%; those who did not report after the deadline and were investigated by others or reported by the landlords themselves would be given necessary punishment after discussion by the masses. In this way, within two days, "air-raid shelter" households reported 18 landlords' hidden items, including 98 silver dollars, three and a half catties of jewelry, 237 pieces of furniture, more than 2,300 catties of grain, eight and a half mu of land, three head of livestock, more than 54,000 yuan, and 400 catties of pepper. Following Nanweiquan, more than ten villages, including Shanghuangtang, Cheyuan, and Kongjiaqi, have also achieved great results in digging out "air-raid shelters." For example, farmer Yan Shide of Shanghuangtang hid more than 200 silver dollars and more than 100 catties of cotton for his relative Yang Shifu in a neighboring village, and he also reported it himself. The whole county is now enthusiastically engaged in the campaign to dig out "air-raid shelters." The county leaders believe that this work is the last battle to eliminate feudalism.

    邢台抽调干部大力突击落后
    争取二月底完成填补
    黎城深入追查地主隐蔽财产
    【本报长治二十九日电】邢台大力突击落后村，争取二月底全县完成填补。该县经过年前翻身大检查，全县二百五十六个行政村中，已有二百个村庄完成填平补齐。五十多个落后村方在开始。县区领导上除将大部干部集中在落后村庄工作外，并从先进村庄抽调村干部与积极分子三百余人，组成翻身队，直接帮助落后村庄，经验证明：这种外力援助，收效很大。对落后村庄的村干部及从运动中涌现出的一部分积极分子，由区加以训练，作为各村推进运动的主力。以上准备工作，旧历年前均已做完，突击落后的运动，现正全面进行。县领导上强调提出：“落后村庄，要特别注意思想发动。中心是解决土地问题，在分配时要把土地的质量、远近、劳力的强弱作适当的调剂，以免再发生量填平质填不平的现象。”并号召所有干部与翻身队同志，全力突击，争取二月底全县完成填补。
    【本报长治二十九日电】黎城翻身检查已至结束阶段，为彻底割除封建尾巴，现已深入进行挖掘地主的“防空洞”。该县发现被清算地主普遍将其大部财物，利用亲友、邻居、相好隐藏。群众称这种人家为地主的“防空洞”。在彻底收回血汗账的口号下，各村普遍展开了挖“防空洞”运动。南委泉村在检查“封建尾巴是否割尽”的总诉苦中，积极分子梁海潮说：“要想翻透身，非挖地主的‘防空洞’不行。”本月十二日全村即召开找“防空洞”大会，农民高计狗说：“防空洞”要自己来找，当场即把其本家高廷壁隐藏的牛报出来；接着荣誉军人杨林森也报出地主王书田藏的棉花、包袱等；妇救会主席赵竹秀报出地主王富英寄存在她家的一万元大洋；子保报出给地主保存的三缸豆；何长方揭露地主高廷坤在北委泉埋伏的五亩地。群众进一步认识了地主的狡计，被蒙蔽隐藏财物者觉悟后，对地主亦极愤恨。区村干部当下即提出：“讨论个办法奖励这种行动。”大家一致决定，凡给地主当“防空洞”者，二天内自己报出，奖给保存东西的价值的一半；最穷的窟窿户，则全部奖给，用各种方法调查出者奖给百分之六十；过期不报，经其他人调查或地主自己报出，经群众讨论，给以必要的处分。这样两天内“防空洞”户报出十八个地主隐藏东西，计有银洋九十八元，首饰三斤半，家具二百三十七件，粮食二千三百余斤，地八亩半，牲口三头，钱五万四千余元，花椒四百斤。继南委泉之后，上黄堂、车元、孔家岐等十余村挖“防空洞”也获得很大成绩。如上黄堂农民阎世德给其外村亲戚杨世福隐藏银洋二百余元，棉花百余斤，也自报出来。现全县挖“防空洞”运动正热烈进行，该县领导同志认为：这一工作是消灭封建的最后一战。
