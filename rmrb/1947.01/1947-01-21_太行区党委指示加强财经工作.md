　　Taihang District Party Committee Issues Instructions on Strengthening Financial and Economic Work
    [This newspaper Changzhi 18th dispatch] The Taihang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions on economic work for 1947, based on the district's economic situation and economic tasks. After briefly outlining the importance of economic work, the instructions pointed out that the general guideline is to achieve economic self-sufficiency through production and thrift. The path to overcome difficulties should begin from three aspects: First, launch a comprehensive large-scale production campaign, starting with a textile campaign, to achieve complete self-sufficiency in cloth. Second, respond to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call to economize on food and clothing, save expenses, and clear public savings. Third, vigorously organize small-scale exports and save on non-urgent imports, striving for a balance between imports and exports.
    Regarding the launch of the textile campaign, it was pointed out that due to the full implementation of land reform in the winter months, the textile campaign was not widely launched. A large-scale textile campaign must be launched in the spring to ensure the completion of 10 million jin of cloth within 100 days in the spring. Therefore, all 13,000 hand-operated shuttle looms, 45,000 handlooms, 12,000 earthen looms, and 454,000 spinning wheels must be fully operational and working intensely. Cooperatives should provide strong assistance and organization, and leadership should focus on fighting to complete this task. Within this year, efforts should be made to ensure that every village grows cotton and every household spins and weaves, so as to achieve complete self-sufficiency in homespun cloth, and strive for a slight surplus. In areas with an existing foundation, it is also necessary to improve quality, universally promote hand-operated shuttle looms, and improve spinning wheels, so as to spin well and weave well, and spin quickly and weave quickly. Ideologically, the perception that homespun cloth is difficult to sell and that Taihang Mountain homespun cloth cannot be self-sufficient at all and must rely on the plains must be overcome.
    In terms of organizing imports and exports, it was pointed out that a small-scale export campaign should be launched in the border areas. Every egg and every ounce of melon seeds should be saved and organized for export in exchange for necessary materials. There should be the idea of accumulating small amounts into large amounts, accumulating zero into whole, and a steady flow of small streams. A mass movement of thrift and export should be organized. In terms of export management, the idea of closed-door construction should be overcome, and the mechanical exchange system should be changed. Legitimate merchants from this district, neighboring districts, and even the Chiang-occupied areas should be provided with convenience. Especially for neighboring districts, the principle of mutual benefit should be followed to facilitate the exchange of materials among the masses, and agreements on mutual adjustment of materials can be signed. Among some tax cadres, it should be clarified that tax policy should be subordinate to trade policy, and taxes should not be levied solely for the purpose of increasing tax revenue. At the same time, the laissez-faire phenomenon of collecting taxes only when requested and not intervening otherwise should also be overcome, and the practice of changing tax rates should be prohibited.
    In addition, in order to meet the urgent demands of the masses in the large-scale production campaign for equipment replenishment and improvement of agricultural and handicraft tools, it is instructed that each sub-district should establish a tool manufacturing factory, each county should establish an iron and wood factory, and in places with blacksmiths and carpenters, blacksmith shops and carpentry shops should be greatly developed. A group of people should be systematically mobilized, organized, and transported from all aspects to handicraft and industrial production. At the same time, from a long-term perspective, apprenticeship should be promoted to cultivate machine workers and craft workers. Farmers and lower-level cadres should be educated to overcome phenomena such as restricting workers from leaving the village, recalling workers who have gone out, and restricting the opening of workshops in the village.
    In addition, in places where small salt is boiled, operations and improvements in salt boiling should be promoted to reduce foreign salt imports. In areas where fuel is scarce, coal kilns and coal stations should be planned to solve the difficulties of the military and civilians. In terms of developing the transportation industry, it was pointed out that after the great development of sideline occupations in the production campaign, some areas may experience overproduction due to inconvenient transportation. In addition to organizing transportation stations and transportation teams on a sub-district basis, special attention should be paid to the connection between the junction of sub-districts, and accurate calculation and organization must be carried out to ensure the coordination of employers and employees, ensure that inns are established along the routes, and reduce the expenses of porters, so as to reduce freight rates. At the same time, attention should be paid to building roads and establishing large-vehicle manufacturing and repair factories.
    In terms of agricultural production, it was pointed out that in areas that can grow cotton but have not yet done so, cotton growing should be promoted. In places suitable for growing medicinal materials and with the habit of growing medicinal materials, growing medicinal materials such as codonopsis should be promoted. Secondly, in order to adapt to the development of rural sideline production and meet the farmers' need for capital adjustment and credit loans, attention should be paid to developing credit cooperative work in the future, and rural cooperatives can set up credit departments.
    Regarding the views and practices on urban and market management, it was pointed out that cities are distribution centers for rural products, and cities should serve the countryside. Cities must be greatly prospered, and commerce, industry, and handicrafts should be developed in conjunction with the large-scale production campaign. For market management, the passive phenomenon and the purely financial perspective must be overcome, so that businesses have businesses to operate and profits to be made. In the operation of industry and commerce, there must be a commodity perspective, a market perspective, and a competition perspective, so as to achieve high quality and low prices, small profits and large sales, obtain social credit, and ensure sales. In addition, the problem that merchants feel that errands and meetings hinder business should be solved by allowing merchants to pay money instead of doing errands and minimizing meetings. The contradictions between the three types of economies, public, cooperative, and private, in cities should also be studied and appropriately organized and established normal relationships. Finally, it was pointed out that all localities must vigorously overcome financial and economic difficulties, strengthen leadership over financial and economic work, and ensure the completion of financial and economic tasks under the correct guidelines.
