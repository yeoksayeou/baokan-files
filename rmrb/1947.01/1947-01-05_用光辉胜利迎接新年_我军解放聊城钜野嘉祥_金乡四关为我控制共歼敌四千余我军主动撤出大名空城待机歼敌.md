Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, January 2nd, Urgent Telegram: General Liu Bocheng's troops, with the glorious victories of liberating Juye and Zhuxian (i.e., Liaocheng) and controlling the four gates of Jinxiang, welcome the bright year of the 36th Republic of China. On the afternoon of New Year's Eve, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army captured all four gates of Juye City in one fell swoop, and launched a general attack on the city that evening. At dawn on New Year's Day, the entire 5th Regiment of the 3rd Detachment of Zhang Lanfeng's puppet Henan Security Corps, one battalion of the 6th Regiment, and all the "returning home legions" from five counties, including Juye and Yuncheng, entrenched in the city were annihilated. Juye City was liberated once again. In addition to those killed and wounded in this battle, over 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops were captured, two mountain guns, eight mortars, 91 light and heavy machine guns, and over a thousand rifles were seized. Other spoils of war are still being inventoried. Another unit of the Eighth Route Army, at the request of the broad masses of the people in Western Shandong, launched a general attack on Wang Jinxiang's puppet troops entrenched in Liaocheng on December 25th. After several days of fierce fighting, the puppet troops suffered heavy casualties, and the remnants fled in disarray. The Eighth Route Army, in addition to dispatching troops to pursue, entered the city on New Year's Day. Thus, the people of the city, who had suffered ten years of enslavement and rule by Japanese invaders and puppet troops, were finally liberated. The last civil war fortress of Chiang Kai-shek's puppets in the Hebei-Shandong liberated area has been uprooted. Simultaneously with the counterattack on Juye, the Eighth Route Army launched a self-defense counterattack on Jinxiang on the evening of the 30th of last month, and annihilated most of the 63rd Regiment of the 21st Brigade of the 88th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army in the Zhang Huayuan area, three miles from the city. Over 300 enemy soldiers below the battalion commander were killed or wounded, over 900 were captured below the battalion commander, three trucks, eight mortars, 62 light and heavy machine guns, 25 grenade launchers, and over 500 rifles were seized. The four gates of Jinxiang are now under the control of the Eighth Route Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, January 3rd: Before the Eighth Route Army liberated Liaocheng this time, the political organs of a certain unit, in order to protect the city's inherent culture, specially ordered the entire army to carry out the following three tasks after entering the city: (1) Stand at attention and salute the tomb of the national hero Fan Zhuxian; (2) Protect the Haiyuan Library, one of China's three major libraries; (3) Properly protect the residence of the Chinese historian Mr. Fu Sinian on this street. Liaocheng was the ancient prefecture of Dongchang. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the traitor Wang Jinxiang colluded with the Japanese invaders to attack Liaocheng. The national hero Fan Gong Zhuxian and the famous Shandong educator Mr. Zhang Yuguang both died with the city. In order to commemorate this anti-Japanese elder, the local people changed Liaocheng County to Zhuxian County.

This Newspaper, Frontline, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, January 3rd, Urgent Telegram: The Eighth Route Army victoriously recovered Jiaxiang City on the evening of New Year's Day. After a unit of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Eighth Route Army captured Juye City at dawn on New Year's Day, they immediately swung their troops eastward towards Jiaxiang. The other unit of Zhang Lanfeng's puppet 3rd Detachment entrenched in the city was terrified upon hearing the news, abandoned the city in a panic, and fled towards Jining. Jiaxiang City was thus liberated again at about 8:00 p.m. on the same day. Many spoils of war were seized, and the results of the battle are still being inventoried.

This Newspaper, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, January 3rd: Chiang Kai-shek's 32nd Division and 85th Division invaded eastward from Chuwang (Neihuang) and Huilong (belonging to Anyang). The Eighth Route Army actively withdrew from the empty city of Daming on the morning of the 1st to await opportunities to annihilate the enemy.
