Masses in the Second Administrative Region of Taihang
Prosper Through Winter Production

[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] Winter production in various counties of the Second Administrative Region has achieved tremendous results as of the end of December. In the third district of Yushe, more than ten villages, including Nancun, Xiangyang, and Taoyang, focus on spinning wool and knitting sweaters due to the local abundance of wool. Children as young as six or seven years old and elderly people in their fifties and sixties are all involved in the movement. The production in the first month is enough to cover their needs for four months. Hao Erman, a female labor hero from Taoyang Village, and her family of five earned more than 150,000 yuan in one month. Based on the local market price of 20 yuan per jin of millet, this could buy 7,767 jin of millet. If each person eats two jin of millet a day, it would last 776 days. In Nancun, there is a skilled knitter of patterned sweaters named Chen Fuhua, who knits three sweaters a day, earning 3,300 yuan, which can buy more than one shi of millet, enough for her to eat for four months. Locals say, "This is not just farming three parts of the time and having a surplus for one; it should be called getting rich through activity." Zhaodian Village in Licheng, located near the main road, focuses on transportation. Under the leadership of labor hero Liu Xian and others, they earned more than 1.2 million yuan in 40 days of production, enough for the entire village of more than 310 people to eat for three months. Shangguangzhi in the first district of Wuxiang mainly mines coal and organizes transportation teams to sell it. In one month, they earned 1,914,600 yuan. Each of the 365 people in the village earned enough to buy more than 260 jin of millet, enough for five months of consumption. Nanjiao and Jiaokou villages in the second district mainly cut rafters and weave cloth, and have also achieved a situation where one day's production can feed the entire village population for three days on average. Winter production in Nanjiao in one month has already made up for the losses caused by wind and frost in the autumn, achieving the goal of farming three parts of the time and having a surplus for one.
