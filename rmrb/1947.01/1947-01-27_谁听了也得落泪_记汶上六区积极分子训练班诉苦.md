Anyone Who Heard It Would Shed Tears

A Record of the Land Reform Activist Training Class in the Sixth District of Wenshang County

The north wind blew for two days straight, and the ice in the pits was thick enough to carry a child. The landlord families had long been huddled around the fire, not stepping outside. But three hundred poor people with no land to till gathered in a courtyard east of Linggang, pouring out their grievances. Fang Zi'an, forty-seven years old, fired the first shot, saying, "My family lives in Fangzhuanggou. As long as I can remember, we've had only that one and a half mu of land. There are seven or eight people in my family. In winter, we have only one tattered quilt, and in summer, we've never worn a new shirt. In the year of the famine, we ate bran and grain all winter, and couldn't even move our bowels." Shi Zonglin from Xichen Village said, "Once, the wind was blowing and the rain was falling, and I couldn't go out to beg for food. My mother told me to go to the pit in front of the door to scoop up the rotten dates floating on the water. I was intercepted by the three sons of the landlord Zhang Shouqin, who wouldn't let me out. I only scolded him once, and his three sons beat me severely. When his father found out, he immediately forced me to leave his broken house. My mother knew the hardship of the poor and didn't ask who was right or wrong. She just cried to me and begged the landlord. Later, I always wanted to become a bandit to get revenge. I have endless grievances to tell." Zhang Xingyou from Chen Village wiped his tears and stood up again, saying, "My father went to the Northeast. My mother held me and led my two older sisters to beg for food. A landlord family was eating. Two big dogs barked and pounced on us. My mother took care of my older sisters and didn't realize that a piece of meat had been bitten off her leg by a dog..." As he spoke, he cried, tears streaming down his face. He wiped them with his hand and continued, "Later, my father sent back some money from the outside, wanting to redeem the one mu of land that had been pawned to the Zhang family. Who knew he was black-hearted and insisted it was a dead pledge. I called the middleman, surnamed Cui, to testify, but he said the middleman didn't know. My mother had no choice but to cry..." He grabbed a handful of snot and continued, "Once, my mother had been hungry for two days. She finally weighed two jin of rice to grind at the mill. The landlord saw it and cursed, saying that on the second day of the second month, when the dragon raises its head, the millstone cannot be moved..." He cried and couldn't speak anymore, "My mother died from eating wheat stalks." Wang Duyuan from Hangang had never told anyone about his own affairs, thinking it was too shameful, but the small rag (handkerchief) in his hand was already soaked with tears. He couldn't hold back anymore and said, "That year, we ate only grass roots, cottonseed, sweet potato leaves, and tree leaves. My mother became swollen all over from eating them and couldn't move her bowels. Soon after, she died." At this time, the whole room was extremely silent. In the northeast corner, several old women were constantly wiping their eyes with their sleeves, wiping them red. The men's heads were lowered, so low that they touched their chests, and no one was smoking. Han Yingyi from Datun, with an unkempt yellow beard all over his face, excitedly broke the silence of the meeting and said, "I bought more than ten mu of land. The traitorous troops digging the river unjustly arrested me and insisted that I was a model soldier, swindling me out of 122,000 yuan. My family property was exhausted, and I still owe a lot of debts. My older sister was beaten to death by Han Jinlin." Han Yingjun from Hangang clenched his fists, tears welling up in his eyes, and angrily said, "My older sister was eighteen years old that year. She went to the field to pick up crops. Han Jinlin insisted that she was stealing his crops and beat her severely. You can imagine a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl being beaten for no reason. Who wouldn't be upset? My older sister cried and jumped into the pit... died..." "Heartless!" "He should pay for his life!" Where were the poor people considered human before? Class hatred burned in everyone's hearts like a raging fire. The mouths of hundreds of people roared for revenge. Director Chen of the Federation was moved to tears of enthusiasm, made a self-criticism to everyone, and firmly stated: "I have been here for seven or eight months and didn't know that everyone had these grievances, nor did I lead everyone well to resolve them. This is my fault. I must lead everyone to reclaim the land and demand repayment of blood debts in the future!" At this time, the sun had already tilted to the west, and the meeting ended.

    谁听了也得落泪

    记汶上六区积极分子训练班诉苦
    接连刮了两天北风，坑里的冰冻得驮得起小孩。地主户们早已围着火再也不出门。但三百个没地种的穷汉，都集坐在龄岗东头的一个院落里，吐诉自己的苦水。四十七岁的房子安打了头一炮，他说：“我家住房庄，从我记事就是那一亩半地，家里七八口人，冬天一条破被子，热天没穿过一次新褂子。那年荒年，咱吃了一冬天糠谷，大便不下。”西陈庄的石宗林说：“有一次，天刮着风，下着雨，不能到外头要饭，俺娘叫我到门前坑里去捞水上漂的烂枣吃，被地主张守勤的三个儿子截着不让我出来，只骂了他一声，被他三个痛打一顿，他父亲知道了，马上逼着我离开他的一间破房子。我母亲知道穷人难，不问谁的是非，只是一面向着我哭，又一面向着地主哀求。后来我总是想当士匪去报仇。我说不尽的苦。”陈庄的张兴有擦了擦眼泪，又站起来说：“俺爹下关东，俺娘抱着我，领着俺两个姐姐要饭，一家地主正在吃饭，两个大狗汪汪的扑上来，俺娘光顾俺姐姐，不防被狗在腿上咬了一块肉……。”他说着哭着热泪直流，他用手擦了擦，又接着说：“后来俺爹从外寄回了几个钱，想把当给地主姓张的那一亩地赎回，谁知道他黑了良心，硬说是死契；我就叫姓崔的中人证明，他说中人不知，俺娘没法，只是哭……。”他抓了把鼻涕，继续的说：“有一次俺娘饿了两天，好容易称了二斤米到碾上去推，地主见了大骂，他说二月里龙抬头，碾磨不能动……。”他哭的再也说不下去了，“俺娘是吃麦杆吃死的”。韩岗的王度员，他原没向别人说过自己的事，以为太丢人，可是他手里一块小破布（手巾），早被泪水湿透了，他再也忍不住了，他说：“那年俺净吃草根、棉花子、红薯叶、树叶，俺娘吃得混身肿，大便不下，不久就死啦。”这时全场万分沉静，东北角里几个老太太，老是用袖子擦着眼，擦的通红了；男人的头低下去，低得挨着胸口，总没有一个吸烟的。大屯的韩英义，脸上长满了不齐整的黄胡子，他激动的冲破了会场的沉寂说：“我买了十来亩地，开河的汉奸队，无故把俺抓走，硬说俺是模范班，诈去了十二万二千元，家产化净了，还欠下很多账。俺姐姐被韩进林打死了”。韩岗的韩英俊握紧了拳头，眼里流着水珠，愤怒的说：“俺姐姐那年十八岁，到地里拾庄稼，韩进林硬说偷他的庄稼，把俺姐姐痛打了一顿；你想十七八岁的闺女，叫人家无故打了一顿，谁不恼的慌，俺姐姐就哭着跳坑……死……啦”，“狼心狗肺”“该叫他偿命”！从前穷人那里是人，阶级的仇恨像烈火一样的烧着每个人的心，百三个人的嘴里发出了报仇的吼声。联合会陈主任被感动得流出了热情的眼泪，向着大伙做了反省，又坚决的表示：“我来了七、八个月，不知道大家有这些冤仇，更没有很好的领着大家把它解除，这是我的不是；我今后一定要领着大家要回土地，讨还血债”！这时太阳已歪到了西边，会议遂告结束。
