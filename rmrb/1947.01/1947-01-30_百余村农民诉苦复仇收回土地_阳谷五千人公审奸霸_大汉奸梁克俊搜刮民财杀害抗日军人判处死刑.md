[Reported by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 27th] In the Yanggu First District, the return of land to the people was combined with the anti-traitor movement. Five thousand people aired their grievances and sought revenge, and the traitor Liang Kejun was shot. At a meeting of over a thousand activists in Cun Village, after determining to jointly struggle against the major traitor Liang Kejun and the major tyrant Qiao Shouchun, on the 30th, farmers from over a hundred villages in the entire district marched towards Dou Village like a tide. The sound of gongs and drums and slogans of "The Poor Turn Over," and "Recover the Land" broke through the silent sky. Five thousand masses wanting to turn over a new leaf crowded into the meeting place of "Airing Grievances, Seeking Revenge, and Recovering Land." The chairman announced the significance of the meeting, and amidst a burst of intense slogans from the entire venue, the major tyrant Qiao Shouchun from Chai Village was brought to the meeting. First, an old man in his eighties from Zang Village, holding a cane, laboriously climbed onto the stage and said angrily: "That year, I went to your jujube orchard to pick jujubes. It's okay if you didn't want me to pick them, but why did you have your three wives, big and small, come together to beat me? My white coat was stained with blood, patches of red all over. I... my wife went to your house, and you beat her and sent her home again. Even now, my legs still can't move. It's all because of your beating!" The old man was extremely angry and reached out to hit the face of the tyrant Qiao Shouchun. The masses below the stage shouted angrily: "He deserves it!" Qiao Shouchun's nephew then said: "That year, you were a traitorous village chief. I borrowed grain to escape the famine, and you forced my family to pay the 'traitor tax.' My whole family went begging. You were really ruthless then!" The entire venue shouted: "Down with the tyrant Qiao Shouchun! Down with Qiao Shouchun who harmed the poor!" A person from Chai Village went on stage and said: "When you were the village chief, you used a big scale to collect and a small scale to distribute. Didn't you embezzle?" After the masses who had been exploited and oppressed one by one poured out their grievances, they dragged him off the stage to await further processing. The cannibalistic major traitor Liang Kejun was escorted onto the stage by three or four guns. The crowd was even more enraged. A man in his fifties from Nan Shaolou jumped onto the stage and said: "Liang Kejun, that year when you were the captain of the traitors, building a stronghold in Liuzhuang, you cut down four or five hundred jujube trees, and even took down the doors, windows, and beams from the houses, and robbed two or three hundred quilts… Our village is poor because of you." Then, a young man said passionately: "That time when the Eighth Regiment attacked the stronghold, you killed eight comrades of the Eighth Regiment. Later, you cut off their heads and hung them on the village gate. You handed over the two wounded to the Japanese devils and had them killed!" The whole venue was extremely angry and unanimously shouted: "Avenge the martyrs!" At this time, three honor soldiers of the Eighth Regiment, hearing of his evil deeds, couldn't bear it anymore and ran to the stage to say to the masses: "Should our wounded soldiers avenge our sacrificed comrades?" Five thousand masses shouted together: "Yes!" Several wounded comrades, holding leather belts, beat the traitor Liang Kejun, whom they hated to the extreme. The masses from Menzhuang asked: "Our village was in arrears with payments, you beat people and poured cold water on them, and also fined the village!" Bitterness and grievances poured out one after another. After unanimous approval by more than five thousand people: Qiao Shouchun is an evil landlord, leaving him ten mu of land and three rooms, and the rest is returned to everyone. Liang Kejun is a major traitor and has also brutally killed several people, to be executed by shooting. Leaving each member of his family two mu of land and one room, and the rest is confiscated. Tian Guang, the county representative and chief of the judicial section, accepted everyone's opinions and had the major traitor Liang Kejun shot. The masses shouted: "A life for a life! Revenge for grievances! Recover our own land!"
