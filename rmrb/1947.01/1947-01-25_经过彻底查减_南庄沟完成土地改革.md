　　After Thorough Investigation and Rent Reduction
    Nanzhuanggou Completes Land Reform
    [Report from this newspaper] Nanzhuanggou in Pingshun has now completed its land reform. Although the village underwent rent and interest reduction in 1942 and investigation and rent reduction in 1944, it was still far from completely eliminating feudalism and realizing "land to the tiller." A small number of landlords still controlled a large amount of land, with landlords leasing land and managing their own land averaging more than four mu per person. The vast majority of peasants still did not have enough land to maintain their livelihoods. The 72 old middle-peasant households averaged only two mu per person, the 26 new middle-peasant households that rose during the War of Resistance averaged only 1.48 mu per person, and the 19 poor-peasant households averaged only 0.58 mu of land per person. Landlords still exploited peasants by renting out land, and it is especially worth noting that landlords used land pawning as a disguised form of exploitation. The entire village still had 18 households with no housing, such as village chief Yuan Xianbao, who still rents a landlord's house. There were still eight households of utterly impoverished people without a single mu of land, completely relying on renting land to survive, such as Shi Shuibao, who became utterly impoverished in 1920 and still has no self-cultivated land. The main reason for this is that in the past, when the fruits were distributed during the movement, whoever had problems received a share. The practice was for the landlords to sell their materials for rice to give to the victims, so these utterly impoverished people who had neither problems nor rice to buy things did not turn over. Thus, the entire village launched a thorough liquidation movement against the landlords. After several days of pouring out grievances, a total of 82 issues such as rent, wages, and local bullies were raised; 45 issues between peasants were also raised. Except for taking struggle measures against six stubborn landlords, the problems were solved by means of seminars, arbitration, and allowing land contributions for enlightened landlords and old rich peasants. The problems between peasants were also completely solved through the Farmers' Association's seminars to resolve knots. After the accounting committee's liquidation, the Nanzhuanggou peasants recovered the following fruits of blood and sweat: 234 mu of land, more than 80 rooms, 13 earthen kilns, 38 livestock, 92 sheep, 199 shi of grain, 124 silver dollars, and more than 300 pieces of clothing and furniture. Before distributing the fruits, ideological mobilization was carried out, proposing the principle of "filling the holes, making up for what is lacking, whoever has a lot of land gets bad and distant land, whoever has bad land gets good and near land." Fifteen appraisers were elected by the masses, and then each household reported their situation and discussed in groups. After the appraisal by the appraisal committee and approval by the masses, the distribution was carried out household by household. This movement in Nanzhuanggou began in early December, and in 20 days, the entire village victoriously completed filling the gaps and making up the differences, realizing "land to the tiller." The poor peasants each obtained an average of 1.5 mu of land, and the land of the new and old middle peasants increased. The average land per person in the entire village of middle and poor peasant households is now more than two mu. The masses have achieved a thorough liberation and are now vigorously turning to the winter production movement.

　　经过彻底查减
    南庄沟完成土地改革
    【本报讯】平顺南庄沟现已完或土地改革。该村虽经过四二年减租减息与四四年查减，但距彻底消灭封建，实现耕者有其田尚远，少数地主仍然掌握着大量土地，地主出租地与自己经营土地每人平均在四亩以上。广大农民仍没有足够维持生活的土地。七十二户旧中农每人平均仅二亩，抗战中新上升的二十六户新中农每人平均仅一亩四分八，贫农十九户每人平均仅五分八厘土地。地主仍以租地剥削农民，尤其值得注意的是地主以土地出典方式变相剥削。全村尚有十八户没房住，如村长元宪保，现在还是租着地主的房子住，尚有八户是地无一亩的赤贫，完全靠种租地过活，如石水保从民国九年就变成赤贫，至今仍无一亩自耕地，所以如此的主要原因：过去运动分果实，是谁有问题谁分，做法上是由地主把物资卖成米给苦主，所以这些既无问题又无米去买东西的赤贫就没翻了身。这样全村展开了彻底清算地主的运动，经过几天的诉苦，共提出租息、工资、恶霸等问题八十二件；农民相互间的问题也提出四十五件。除对六户顽固地主采取斗争外，对开明地主与旧富农都是用座谈仲裁允许献田等方式解决问题。农民相互间的问题，经过农会座谈解疙瘩亦即全部解决。经过算账委员会的清算这次南沟农民共收回血汁果实计：土地二百三十四亩，房八十余间，土窑十三孔，牲口三十八头，羊九十二只，粮食一百九十九石，银洋一百二十四元，衣物家具三百余件。分配果实前即作了思想动员，提出：“填平窟窿，缺什补什，谁家土地好多分坏地远地，谁家土地坏多分好地近地”的原则。并由群众选出评议员十五人，然后各户自报分组讨论，经评议会评定，群众通过后即逐户分配。南沟这次运动从十二月初开始，二十天全村就胜利的完成了填平补齐，实现了耕者有其田，贫农平均每人都获得了一亩半土地，新旧中农的土地都增加了，全村中农户与贫农户，现在每人的平均土地都在二亩以上。群众获得了彻底的翻身，正轰轰烈烈地转入了冬季生产运动。
