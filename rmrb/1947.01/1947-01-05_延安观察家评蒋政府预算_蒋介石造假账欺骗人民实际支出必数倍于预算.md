Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 31st: According to a report from the Central News Agency: Peng Xuepei announced at a press conference on the 30th that the Chiang government's 1947 budget (from January to December) was 9.32 trillion yuan. Observers here state that this figure has been drastically reduced to deceive the people; the actual expenditure of the Chiang government next year will be several times this amount. Firstly, based on the situation in the past few years, such as in 1945, the Chiang government announced a budget of over 400 billion yuan, but the actual expenditure exceeded three times that amount, reaching over 1.2 trillion yuan. In 1946, the Chiang government announced a budget of 2.5 trillion yuan, but it was completely used up in the first five months. In July and August, the Chiang government's monthly expenditure exceeded 1 trillion yuan. And since September, according to materials from the Shanghai Economic Report, the Chiang government's monthly currency issuance has exceeded 2 trillion yuan. Therefore, the total annual expenditure must far exceed 10 trillion yuan, approximately ten times the actual expenditure in 1945. Therefore, the actual expenditure next year must also exceed this number several times. Secondly, the composition of the budget announced by Peng Xuepei is also completely unreliable. According to the announcement, "military expenses account for over 40 percent" of next year's budget. The Chiang government had previously announced a roughly equal proportion last year, but in reality, the Chiang government's civil war military expenses accounted for over 80 percent of the actual expenditure. Furthermore, Peng Xuepei announced that next year's budget "party affairs expenses will not be announced for the time being." Chen Lifu admitted in a statement a few days ago that Kuomintang party fees are still paid from the national treasury. This year, this "party fee" accounted for "8 percent" of the total expenditure (Central Daily News figures cited by a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 29th), amounting to over 1 trillion yuan (excluding "special agent fees"). It is expected that next year's "party fee" and special agent fees will be even greater. In next year's budget, it is announced that education expenses are 340 billion yuan, accounting for only 3 percent of the total expenditure. However, given that the Chiang government's military expenditures, etc., must be much greater than the publicly stated budget, the proportion of education expenses will be very small in comparison. Observers state: The Chiang government is facing an extremely severe financial crisis of hyperinflation, which is why the Chiang government dares not disclose its actual expenditures and true budget.

　　延安观察家评蒋政府预算
    蒋介石造假账欺骗人民实际支出必数倍于预算
    【新华社延安三十一日电】据中央社讯：三十日彭学沛在记者招待会上宣布：蒋政府一九四七年度（一月起十二月止）预算为九万亿三千二百亿元。此间观察家称，这个数目字是经过竭力缩小借以欺骗人民的；明年度蒋政府的实际支出必将数倍于此。因为第一、证之过去数年情形，如一九四五年蒋政府宣布预算为四千余亿元，但实支则超出三倍。为一万亿二千亿元以上。一九四六年蒋政府宣布预算为二万亿五千亿元。但头五个月即已全部用完，七、八两月蒋政府每月支出均在一万亿元以上。而自九月起，据上海经济汇报材料，蒋政府每月发钞数即已超出二万亿元。因此，全年实支必远超十万亿元，约为一九四五年度实际支出十倍。故下年度实支必亦至少将超出此数数倍。第二、彭学沛所宣布的预算构成也是绝不可信的。据宣布下年度预算中“军事费占百分之四十强”。上年蒋政府曾宣布约略相等的比例数，但实际上蒋政府的内战军事费占实支百分之八十以上。又，彭学沛宣布下年度预算“党部经费暂不公布”，旬日前陈立夫谈话曾承认国民党党费仍由国库支付，今年该项“党费”共占全部支出的“百分之八”（二十九日合众社沪电引中央日报数字），约达一万亿元以上，（“特工费”还不在内。）预计下年度“党费”特务费为数必更巨。下年度之预算中，据宣布教育费为三千四百亿元，比例只为总支出的百分之三。但鉴于蒋政府军事支出等必大于公开预算极大，相形之下，教育费所占之比例必十分微小。观察家称：蒋政府正面临极度恶性通货膨胀的财政危机，这就是蒋政府不敢公开其实际支出与真正预算的原因。
