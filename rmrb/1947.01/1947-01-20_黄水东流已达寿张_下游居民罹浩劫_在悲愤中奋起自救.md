　　The Yellow River Has Reached Shou Zhang
    Downstream Residents Suffer Catastrophe
    Rising Up in Grief and Indignation to Save Themselves
    Chiang Kai-shek Actively Pursuing Diversion of Yellow River into the Wei River
    Intending to Plunge the Entire North China into Yellow River Disaster
    Chiang Kai-shek's Crimes of Blocking the Breach and Releasing Water are Heinous

    [This Newspaper's Frontline in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 18th Dispatch] The head of the Yellow River water reached east of the Qingshui River, southeast of Shou Zhang, Shandong, on the 17th. It is about one zhang deep and one li wide, flowing at a speed of over 40 li per day. On the 14th, it flowed into the Linpu Market (southwest of Juancheng) in our liberated area. On the 15th and 16th, it passed through the territory of Pu County and Fan County, reaching Shou Zhang on the 17th. In the nine years since the Yellow River changed its course, many residents who had moved into the riverbed had built houses and gardens and planted wheat. Chiang Kai-shek failed to implement the decision to issue relocation fees and, without waiting for the levee to be restored, arbitrarily blocked the breach and released the water. Wherever the Yellow River water reached, it was a vast expanse of water, and wheat fields and houses were all washed away. Seeing this tragic scene, the residents along the river were filled with grief and indignation, and they carried out rescue work one after another, and complained to the democratic government about Chiang Kai-shek's crimes.
    [This Newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 16th Dispatch] (Delayed) The Yellow River water has flowed to Dongkou Village in Juancheng on the 15th. It is half a li to one li wide, one chi deep in shallow places, and one zhang deep in deep places. It is estimated that it will reach Fan County on the evening of the 16th. When the Yellow River water flowed through Xiaodizi Village in the old river course in Dongming County, a new levee about eight li long was eroded by the rapid current and was about to be in danger. Moreover, the Chiang army in the Liangmen area frequently came out to sabotage, causing the masses in the county to be unable to repair the levee. The masses were extremely indignant and said, "Why did the Kuomintang release the water before the levee was repaired?" "Let's rise up and save ourselves!"
    [This Newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 16th Urgent Dispatch] According to the Kaifeng newspaper *Northwest Society* News: The Kuomintang's "Diversion of the Yellow River into the Wei River" has been surveyed and completed and is now requesting funds for implementation. The project to divert the Yellow River into the Wei River was initially handled by the enemy and puppets, and was terminated after the Japanese surrender. The Kuomintang has been actively preparing to resume work for a long time. The Water Conservancy Bureau sent technicians such as Wang Zhaolun to survey the area on November 26 last year. After the members finished surveying and returned to Bian, they said: The total canal for diverting into the Wei River starts from the west side of the Pinghan Railway Bridge on the north bank of the Yellow River, flows north along the Pinghan Road, passes through Zhan Dian, Kang Village, and Xiaoji, and enters the Wei River near Xinxiang Village, with a total length of 56 kilometers and a bottom width of 15 meters. The earthwork project has been completed. Except for the flood control gate at the head of the canal, the other buildings, such as the water inlet gate, have been completed. Due to the lack of management institutions, the canal buildings have been slightly damaged, but the damage is not serious. If the Kuomintang authorities' vicious plan is implemented, it will plunge the entire North China into a Yellow River catastrophe. The military and civilians in the liberated areas of North China must rise up to save themselves and stop this heinous crime of the Kuomintang.

　　黄水东流已达寿张
    下游居民罹浩劫
    在悲愤中奋起自救
    蒋介石又积极进行引黄入卫
    欲使整个华北陷于黄水灾害
    蒋介石堵口放水罪恶滔天
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十八日电】黄河水头已于十七日到达山东寿张东南清水河以东。深约一丈，宽一华里。每天流速四十余华里。十四日流入我解放区临濮集（鄄城西南），十五及十六日过濮县、范县境，十七日达寿张。九年来因黄河改道，许多迁移到河身内的住民建屋造园，种植小麦。蒋介石不执行发给迁移费的决议，不待复堤即擅行堵口放水，黄水所至，一片汪洋，麦田房屋全被水冲。沿河居民睹此惨状，痛恨万分，纷纷进行抢救工作，并向民主政府控诉蒋介石的罪行。
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】（迟到）黄河水于十五日已流至鄄城董口村。宽半华里至一华里，浅处一尺，深处一丈。估计十六日晚可至范县。黄水流过东明县境故道小堤子村时，一段新堤约八华里被急流冲刷，将要出险。而两门一带蒋军又时出破坏，致该县群众不能进行修堤。群众愤慨万分，都说：“为啥不修好堤国民党就放水呢？”“我们起来自救吧！”
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日急电】据开封报载《西北社》讯：国民党“导黄入卫”已测量竣事，正请款实施中。引黄入卫工程初由敌伪经办，日寇投降后终止，国民党久已积极筹备复工，水利局于去年十一月二十六日，曾派技工王昭伦等前往测量。该员等于测竣返汴后称：入卫总干渠系自黄河北岸平汉路铁桥迤西起沿平汉路北流，经詹店、亢村小冀至新乡村近入卫河，计长五十六公里，底宽十五公尺，土方工程已全部完成，建筑物除渠首防洪闸尚未建筑外，其他如进水闸等均已完成，因无管理机构，渠道建筑物略有损坏，但损坏情形并不严重云。国民党当局这一狠毒计划如见诸实施，将使整个华北陷于黄水浩劫，我华北各解放区军民应急起自救，制止国民党此一滔天罪行。
