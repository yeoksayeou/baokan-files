	Record of the Annihilation of the Enemy at Gongtang

	On January 7th, Fang Xianjue, the former commander-in-chief of the puppet army who had been enfeoffed by the Japanese Emperor and now the KMT garrison commander of Yutai, dispatched the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division, which Chiang Kai-shek had transferred from Taiwan to Shanghai and then to Xuzhou, and then urgently to Yutai, to reinforce Jinxiang. As soon as they approached the vicinity of Zhou Lou, fifteen miles away from Jinxiang, one of their battalions was wiped out by our unit. Although the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, when our army launched an attack, the enemies more than two miles away fled, and the enemies within two miles lay motionless on the ground. When our warriors with bayonets charged over, they surrendered their guns. This is not to say that the unit had no fighting power, but rather to explain that the Jiangnan compatriots who had been deceived into fighting a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek and the Taiwan compatriots who had long been enslaved by Japan were really unwilling to be American slaves and slaughter their fellow countrymen. The weapons they handed over were all specially made for marine operations during the Japanese southward advance, and were particularly resistant to moisture. There were "Type 92" heavy machine guns with scopes and phosphorescent lights for night firing, and "Type 99" light machine guns with bayonets, and "Type 99" rifles with "rifle grenade" launchers. This type of rifle could fire a bullet and launch a rifle grenade at the same time, which, if it hit, was enough to kill or wound an entire platoon, and could be called a new type of weapon compared to American rifles. Such enemies with such weapons encouraged our soldiers. At that time, we did not know where the enemy had retreated, only that they had not retreated into the city and were still preparing to continue their invasion against us, so we advanced in an encounter battle posture.
	At midnight on January 8th, the enemy was discovered at Gongtang, four miles northwest of Yutai. At this time, friendly neighboring troops had already opened fire to the north and northeast of Yutai. The enemy at Gongtang was terrified and fired fierce artillery fire. The shells rained down, and the machine guns swept like a wind, turning the night red. A certain unit of our army acted swiftly and bravely, breaking through the enemy's barricades. A machine gunner carried the machine gun on his shoulder and charged forward, consolidating each point as he advanced. They methodically occupied the eastern half of Gongtang, capturing Xie Maoquan, the brigade commander of the 140th Brigade, and all of his direct subordinates, and seizing four mountain guns, cutting off the enemy's return route to Yutai city. Immediately afterwards, we surrounded the western half of Gongtang, the 280th Regiment led by the brigade headquarters, in a posture of overwhelming force. Because the engineers and infantry cooperated well, they quickly blew up two large bunkers that were obstructing the infantry's advance. The front-line commander personally stood on a bunker with a machine gun, firing down from a commanding position. The fierce firepower network of our entire team also pressed down from the sky, intimidating the enemy. At the same time, we began to shout: "Don't be American slaves for Chiang Kai-shek to kill your fellow countrymen!" "You came all the way from Taiwan, and even if you don't get killed, you will be dragged to death. Sooner or later you will be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek." The shouts moved the KMT soldiers, coupled with the threat of fierce artillery fire and the shouts of their own brigade commander Xie Maoquan, ordering them to surrender their guns, so the 280th Regiment raised the white flag at twelve o'clock on January 9th. Immediately afterwards, the adjutant, representing Zhou Jue, the colonel and regimental commander of the 280th Regiment, arrived at our army's front-line headquarters. The front-line commander explained our army's policies to this adjutant simply and concisely, but the representative of the 280th Regiment, eager to surrender his gun, asked impatiently: "Regimental commander, please tell us quickly how to surrender our guns." The front-line commander ordered him: "Put down all your weapons and go to the village to the south to await orders with your bare hands." The representative ran back quickly. So Zhou Jue ordered the entire 280th Regiment to put down their weapons, raise white flags, and assemble in the village to the south to await orders, and our army quickly went to receive the weapons.

    巩堂歼敌记
    田兵
    一月七日，曾受日本天皇加封的先和军总司令现任鱼台蒋军守将方先觉，把蒋介石从台湾调到上海又调到徐州紧跟着调到鱼台的七十师一四○旅，马不停蹄的派来增援金乡，在距金乡十五里路的周楼一带被我某部一接近便消灭了一个营。敌人的炮火虽然猛烈，但当我军进行攻击时，二里以外的敌人便撒开腿逃跑了，二里地以内的敌人便伏在地上一动不动，待我们端着刺刀的战士跑过去，他们就起来交了枪。这并不是说明该部没有战斗力，而是说明那些被骗来替蒋介石打内战的江南同胞和久受日本奴役的台湾同胞，实在不愿再做美国的奴隶，来屠杀祖国的同胞了，他们交过来的武器都是日本南进时代专为海洋作战造的，特别能耐水汽，有带瞄准镜而夜间发射磷光的“九二式”重机枪和“九九式”带刺刀的轻机枪，有带“枪榴弹”筒的“九九式”步枪，这种步枪打出子弹去同时可发射一个枪溜弹，如果命中，足以杀伤一个排，和美国的步枪比较也堪称新式武器。这样的敌人使着这样的武器，便鼓励了我们的战士。当时我们并不知道敌人退到什么地方，只知道没有退进城去，还准备继续向我进犯，于是我们便以遭遇战的姿态向前挺进。
    一月八日的午夜，在距鱼台西北四里的巩堂发现敌人，此时友邻部队在鱼台正北和东北已经打响，巩堂的敌人恐惧起来了，发射着猛烈的炮火，炮弹像下雨一样，机枪像刮风一样，把夜都烧红了。我军某部动作迅速勇猛，突破了敌人的鹿砦，机枪射手把机枪架在肩上朝前冲锋，突进了一点就巩固一点。有条不紊的占领了巩堂东半截，俘虏了一四○旅旅长谢懋权及其全部直属队，并缴获了山炮四门，截断了敌人回鱼台城的归路。紧接着我们便以泰山压顶的姿势，包围了巩堂西半截旅直所率领的二八○团，由于工兵和步兵配合得好，迅速的爆破了障碍步兵前进的两个大碉堡，前线指挥员亲自端着机关枪站在一个碉楼上，居高临下的朝下射击，我们全队的猛烈火力网也从天空平压下去，使得敌人胆寒，同时我们展开了喊话：“不要跟蒋介石当美国奴隶来杀祖国的同胞！”“你们远从台湾来，打不死也要拖死的，早晚是要给蒋介石当炮灰。”喊话感动了蒋军的士兵，加上猛烈炮火的威胁和他们自己的旅长谢懋权的喊话，命令他们交枪，于是二八○团便于一月九日十二时，挑起了白旗。紧接着二八○团上校团长周觉的代表副官到了我军前线指挥所，前线指挥员把我军的政策，简单扼要的向这位副官解释，可是急于交枪的二八○团的代表性急的问：“团长，请你赶快告诉我们怎样交枪吧。”前线指挥员便命令他：“你们把全部武器都放下，徒手到南边村庄去待命。”那位代表就急步跑回去了。于是周觉便命令二八○团全部放下武器，挑着白旗整队到南边庄上集合待命，我军也就迅速的前往接收武器。
