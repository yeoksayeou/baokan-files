    【Our Newspaper News】The liberated peasants of Gengle Village, Shexian County, while joyfully celebrating the Lunar New Year, expressed their gratitude to their great benefactors, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, saying, "Today's good times are given to us by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu." The entire village selected two of their best leather coats to send to their benefactors, and wrote many letters of gratitude. One of them reads: "Dear Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: We hope you are in good health! Under your leadership, we have been thoroughly liberated, overturning every single stone slab, and we feel so relieved! This relief of ours is given by you, and we will never forget it for ten thousand years. The two of you are even closer to us than our own parents. We have nothing good to thank you with, except to send you two leather coats to express our feelings. Besides this, we can only forever follow the path you two have pointed out for us." Another letter reads: "Comrade Chairman Mao: If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to achieve liberation. Supporting you comes from a poor heart; the gift is light, but the righteousness is heavy... Sending this leather coat is only right; I hope to have a photo so I can be at ease, knowing that our old benefactor has worn it." The entire village also presented two leather coats to Commander Liu and Chairman Yang.
