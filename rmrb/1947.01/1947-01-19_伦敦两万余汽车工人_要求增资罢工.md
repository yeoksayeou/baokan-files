Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Reports from various sources: A major strike of truck workers erupted in London, the British capital, at the beginning of 1947. As of the 11th, the strike had expanded to over 20,000 people. Currently, seven ministers of the Labor government are in London monitoring its development, and British Prime Minister Attlee is also kept informed of the situation by telephone. The striking workers declared that if the government sends troops to maintain food transport, the labor unrest will continue to expand (meaning this would replace the work of the auto workers). It is reported that the reason for this strike is that the striking workers are dissatisfied with the wage negotiations, which have been going on for nine months without a resolution. The demands of the striking workers include a 44-hour work week, twelve days of annual leave, and continued payment of wages.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Reports from various sources: The strike of London automobile workers is still expanding. The 14th was the eighth day of the strike, and the number of strikers has increased to 25,000. Since the 13th, the British government, disregarding the opposition of the striking workers, has requisitioned troops to take over transportation work. This measure has aroused widespread indignation among general transportation workers in London. Other public transport, tram, and supply workers, such as food handlers, are holding sympathy strikes. The Associated Press reported that the crisis is increasing and seems to be developing into the most serious situation since the 1926 general strike. It is reported that the use of troops has even caused divisions within the cabinet.

　　伦敦两万余汽车工人
    要求增资罢工
    【新华社延安十三日电】各方报导：一九四七年岁首英京伦敦爆发载重汽车工人的大罢工。截至十一日止，这一罢工已扩大到二万人以上。目前有七位工党政府的部长在伦敦注意其发展，英首相艾德礼亦随时经电话了解情况。罢工工人声明，如政府派遣军队维持粮食运输，则工潮将继续扩大（按这将代替汽车工人之工作）。据悉：此次罢工的原因，在于罢工工人不满历时九月的工资谈判尚未得到解决，罢工工人的要求包括每周工作四十四小时，每年休假十二天，工资照发。
    【新华社延安十六日电】各方报导：伦敦汔车工人的罢工仍在扩大中。十四日为罢工的第八日，罢工者已增至二万五千人，自十三日起英政府已不顾罢工工人的反对，征用军队接替运输工作，此种措施引起伦敦一般运输工人的普遍愤激。其他公共汽车、电车及供应方面的工人如粮食搬运工人等举行同情罢工。合众社称：危机更形增加，似将形成一九二六年总罢工以来之最严重的情势。据悉：使用军队的行动甚至已引起内阁中的分歧。
