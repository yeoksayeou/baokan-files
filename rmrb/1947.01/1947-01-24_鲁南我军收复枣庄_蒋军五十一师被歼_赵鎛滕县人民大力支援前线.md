Xinhua News Agency, Lunan Front, urgent telegram, 21st: The entire 51st Division of Chiang's army, entrenched in the famous coal-producing area of Zaozhuang, was completely annihilated by the East China People's Liberation Army at 12:00 today. This important town in Lunan, which was occupied by Chiang's army on October 8th of last year, has returned to the people after a lapse of just over three months.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st: During this Lunan self-defense counter-offensive, the people of Zhao Bo (north of Pi County) and Teng County supported the front day and night, cooperating with the main force in combat. In Zhao Bo's fifth district, 1,500 stone mills worked non-stop, producing 12,000 catties of flour and 13,000 catties of baked pancakes for the front lines by the morning of New Year's Day. Dou Cun, the model village chief of the district, led the villagers in making 3,000 catties of pancakes overnight. The militia and work teams of the two counties, including demolition and sharpshooter teams, emerged in front of the enemy or deep behind enemy lines to block the advance of the 169th Brigade of the 26th Division of Chiang's army on the northern route, causing the northern Chiang army to advance only 50 li in six days. The enemy in Lanling in the central route took three days to cross a small river only 200 meters wide, suffering more than 30 casualties from militia mine explosions and sniper fire. Railway vehicles withdrawing on the Lin-Zao railway triggered mines, destroying one locomotive and two carriages.
