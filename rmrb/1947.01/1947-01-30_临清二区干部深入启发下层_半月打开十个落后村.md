Linqing Second District Cadres Deeply Inspire the Lower Levels
    Ten Backward Villages Opened Up in Half a Month

    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 27th] Within half a month, the Second District of Linqing opened up ten backward villages, including Wulimiao and Yaotitou, and brought down thirty-five traitors, local bullies, and landlords, two vicious rich peasants, settled accounts with twenty-two landlord families and fourteen rich peasant families (only settling accounts for the portion of feudal exploitation), recovered 26,068 mu of land and a large amount of movable property, and completely solved the land problem for the peasants. The general situation and characteristics of these backward villages are: 1. There are organizations such as the Chiang Kai-shek secret assassination group, carrying out espionage activities and threatening the masses. 2. The puppet village regime and puppet organizations have not been completely destroyed, and lawless landlords continue to rule the masses. 3. Feudal die-hard landlords use superstitious groups (such as Yiguandao) to win over and numb the masses. 4. Lawless landlords use money and beautiful women to buy and lure tenant farmers, attempting to create opposition between tenant farmers and the masses. The opening up of these backward villages was primarily due to cadres going deep into the masses, understanding the situation, and exposing the conspiracies of lawless landlords. They also went deep into superstitious groups, using the deception, conspiracies, and criminal facts of their upper-level leaders to educate and enlighten the awareness of the lower-level masses. Secondly, a cadre ideological meeting was held to carry out class education, resolve internal contradictions, and mobilize activists willing to resolve contradictions to frankly admit their mistakes, achieving thorough unity and shattering the feudal forces' conspiracy to sow discord. Thirdly, the organization was reorganized, bad elements were purged, a large number of peasants were absorbed into the peasants' association, and the struggle was launched.

    临清二区干部深入启发下层
    半月打开十个落后村
    【本报威县二十七日电】临清二区半月内打开了五里庙、姚堤头等十个落后村，斗倒了汉奸恶霸地主三十五个，恶霸富农二个，清算了地主二十二家，富农十四家（只清算封建剥削部分），追出土地二万六千零六十八亩及许多浮财，全部解决了农民土地问题。这些落后村一般情况与特点是：一、有蒋特暗杀团等组织，进行特务活动，威胁群众。二、伪村政权伪组织未被彻底摧垮，不法地主继续统治群众。三、封建顽固地主利用迷信团体（一贯道等）拉拢麻痹群众。四、不法地主以金钱美女收买、引诱雇佃，企图造成雇佃与群众的对立。这些落后村庄的打开，首先是因干部深入群众，了解情况，揭破了不法地主的阴谋。并深入迷信团体中，以其上层头子的欺骗阴谋与罪恶事实，教育启发下层群众的觉悟。其次召开干部思想会，进行阶级教育，解决内部矛盾，动员愿意解决矛盾的积极分子坦白承认错误，达到了彻底团结，粉碎了封建势力挑拨离间的阴谋。第三是整理了组织，清洗了不良分子，吸收广大农民参加农会，发动了斗争。
