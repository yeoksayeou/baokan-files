Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th: For the past six months, numerous literary and art workers on the Central China front, including the Central China Military Region's Cultural Troupe, Children's Peking Opera Troupe, Film Team, and Jianghuai Photography Society, have been active in the front lines of the self-defense war, fully demonstrating their brave and self-sacrificing spirit of serving the people. Since the beginning of the self-defense, almost all of the Cultural Troupe's Third Team participated in frontline work. Comrades Sun Xianglin and Wang Chunmao of the team gloriously sacrificed themselves while rescuing the wounded under heavy fire. Comrade Huang Shiwen was also wounded in combat. Comrade Li Zewu, a female comrade, went back and forth seven times on the front line to transport the wounded. The Cultural Troupe's Fourth Group immediately organized a brass band to play folk songs and ditties loved by the soldiers during the intervals when the troops had just left their positions to rest. Currently, the troupe has created more than 50 songs, and regularly performs more than 20 plays, skits, Yangko dances, and variety shows. Plays such as "Everything for the Frontline," "Emancipation and Self-Defense," and "The Mask" are deeply loved by the soldiers. The Children's Peking Opera Troupe's fifty or sixty children can perform nearly a hundred Peking operas. They perform almost every day. Films are shown on the front lines, sometimes only four or five li away from the front line. Before the films are shown, photos of many combat heroes first appear on the screen, and the soldiers applaud and cheer enthusiastically. The photography team went deep into the front lines and photographed more than 300 scenes of the great battles of the Seven Victories in Seven Battles in Central Jiangsu. They held a roving exhibition in the war zone 15 times, which was very popular among the soldiers.

    华中前线文艺工作活跃
    华中军区文工团、孩子平剧团、电影队、江淮摄影社等无数文艺工作者们，半年来活跃于自卫战争前线，充分表现了为人民服务的勇敢自我牺牲精神。自卫开始，文工团三队几全部参加了战地工作。该队孙祥林、王春茂同志曾在猛烈炮火下因抢救伤员而光荣牺牲。黄石文同志亦在战斗中负伤。女同志李则吾在火线上七次往返抢运伤员。文工团第四小组在部队刚离开阵地休息的间隙，立即组织铜乐队演奏战士热爱之民歌小调。现在该团创造的歌曲已达五十多首，经常演出的话剧、活报、秧歌杂耍有二十多个。话剧如“一切为了前线”，“翻身自卫”，“假面具”等深为战士喜爱。孩子平剧团五六十个孩子能演近百出平剧。几乎无日不演出。电影在前线放映，有几次只离前线四、五里。影片放影前，许多战斗英雄的照片首先在银幕上出现，战士们无不热烈鼓掌欢呼。摄影组曾深入前线，摄得苏中七战七捷的伟大战斗场面三百余幅，在战地巡回展览共十五次，战士们非常欢迎。
