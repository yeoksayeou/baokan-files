    The front line during the Spring Festival is filled with the joy of victory.
    The masses in a certain area warmly welcome our army.
    Soldiers and civilians exchange New Year greetings.
    [Report from the Jilu豫 Front, January 25th by our newspaper] The Field Headquarters of the Jilu豫 Front arrived at a certain garrison before the Lunar New Year's Eve. The local people beamed with joy and warmly welcomed their own troops, offering a fat pig as a token of appreciation. When the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied these areas, the masses suffered from their killings, looting, and bullying, eagerly anticipating the arrival of their own army. Once their hopes were fulfilled, they felt doubly close to them. On Lunar New Year's Eve, every household had red couplets given by the army pasted on their doors. On the doors of the three villagers who were buried alive by Chiang's troops, blue couplets were pasted, the verses overflowing with the determination for revenge and national integrity. On the Lunar New Year's Day, the army and the people exchanged New Year greetings, and the army paid New Year visits to the families of martyrs and soldiers. In the midst of the swirling snow, the lines of prisoners captured in recent days constantly passed by, further reinforcing the confidence of the army and the people in their own strength. Everywhere was filled with the joy of victory.

    春节中前线洋溢着胜利的欢欣
    某地群众热烈欢迎我军
    军队和老乡们互相拜年
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五日电】冀鲁豫前线野战司令部在旧历除夕前到达某驻地，当地群众笑逐颜开，热烈的欢迎自己的队伍。并以肥猪一口慰劳。当进犯蒋军侵占这些地区时，群众受尽了蒋军的杀掠和欺侮，日夜盼望自己军队来到；一旦盼望到了，就倍加亲切。旧历除夕，老乡家家门上都贴着军队送的红对联；在三个被蒋军活埋的老乡家门上，则贴着蓝色的，联语中洋溢着复仇的决心和民族气节。旧历元旦，军队和老乡互祝新禧，军队向烈属、军属拜年。在瑞雪纷飞中，最近几天捉来的俘虏的行列不断走过，军民更加相信自己的力量，到处洋溢着胜利的欢欣。
