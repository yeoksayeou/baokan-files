　　British War Office Officially Announces
    Montgomery's Imminent Visit to the Soviet Union
    Trip Will Go Far Beyond a Courtesy Call
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th] Reports from various sources: The British War Office officially announced on the 28th that Field Marshal Montgomery, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, will visit the Soviet Union in the spring of 1947. This visit is in response to an invitation from the Soviet side during the Potsdam Conference in 1945, which was reiterated by Soviet Chief of General Staff Marshal Vasilevsky on October 14th of this year. It is also understood that the British people are extremely pleased with the Soviet invitation. The London Daily Express wrote on the 28th: Private meetings based on friendship are beneficial to both countries. It also suggested that Soviet Chief of General Staff Vasilevsky should also visit Britain after Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] Agence France-Presse, London: Well-informed sources claimed on the 31st that Montgomery will carry instructions from the British cabinet when he goes to the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that this trip will go far beyond a courtesy call. Montgomery will be ordered to suggest that Britain and the Soviet Union exchange certain military intelligence. British military officials refused to confirm or deny the possibility of high-level Soviet-British staff talks during Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources in London revealed that Montgomery mainly intends to thoroughly study the experience gained by the Soviet High Command in transportation and supply problems during World War II. They believe that this can be confirmed by the accompanying presence of General Robert H. H. Macleod, who is an expert on this issue in the British Imperial General Staff.

　　英陆军部正式宣布
    蒙哥马利即将访苏
    此行将远超过拜会性质
    【新华社延安三十日电】各方报导：英陆军部于二十八日正式宣布，参谋总长蒙哥马利元帅将于一九四七年春访苏，此行系应一九四五年波茨顿会议时苏方之邀，该邀请又于今年十月十四日为苏军参谋总长华西列夫斯基元帅所重申。又悉，英国人民对苏联的邀请均极欢欣。伦敦每日快报于二十八日撰文称：以友谊为基础之私人接见，对两国均有裨益。并建议蒙帅访苏后苏参谋总长华西列夫斯基亦能赴英一游。
    【新华社延安一日电】法新闻社伦敦讯：消息灵通人士于三十一日声称：蒙哥马利赴苏时，将携带英阁的指示，一般认为此行将远超过拜会性质。蒙氏将奉命向苏联建议英苏双方交换某些军事情报，英国军界人士拒绝承认或否认在蒙哥马利聘苏之际苏英高级参谋部举行会谈的可能性。伦敦消息灵通方面透露，在目前蒙哥马利主要是打算透彻的研究苏联高级参谋部从二次大战中所取得关于运输与供应问题的经验，他们认为这可由罗伯特。恩克麦隆将军之随行加以证实。后者是英帝国参谋部关于此项问题的专家。
