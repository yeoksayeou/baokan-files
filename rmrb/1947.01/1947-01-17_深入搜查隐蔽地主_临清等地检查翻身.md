　　Thoroughly Search for Hidden Landlords
　　Inspection of Emancipation in Linqing and Other Places
　　[Report from our newspaper's correspondent in Weixian, Jinnan, 15th] The land reduction campaign in Linqing is entering a deeper stage. In half of the villages in the old liberated areas of Districts Six, Eight, Nine, and Ten, the dispersed properties of unlawful landlords are being investigated and distributed to landless or land-poor peasants. In villages like Huguanzhuang in District Eight, each person has already received an average of more than three mu of land. Internal clan conflicts among the masses are now being resolved, and a large number of middle peasants are being absorbed into the farmers' associations. In villages like Zhengzhuang in District Six, the approach is to rectify and reflect on the village cadres involved in clan struggles while simultaneously re-mobilizing the masses and cultivating activists. In the new liberated areas of Districts Two, Three, Four, Five, and Seven, the struggle against traitors, the clearing of accounts, and the "land returns home" campaign are being implemented. In District Two, within half a month in nine villages including Litang, twenty-six landlords who were also overlooked collaborators and local bullies were overthrown, resolving the land problem for the peasants, with each person receiving an average of more than three mu of land. In villages like Aoli in District Three, fifteen types of unresolved fruit-sharing cases were cleared up, and all the fruit was redistributed to the masses. It is expected that through this land reduction campaign, Linqing will completely and thoroughly realize land reform by the end of the old year.
　　[Report from our newspaper's correspondent in Weixian, 15th] Pingxiang and Julu are accelerating the inspection of emancipation to thoroughly implement land reform. According to investigations in Julu, it was found that eight landlord families in Xinzhuang had not changed their class status. The village still had two extremely poor households and eighteen poor peasant households. Many members and cadres were engaging in monopolization, and the distribution of fruit was unfair. In response to the above situation, the leadership proposed that while carrying out land reduction, the work style of cadres should be transformed, and feudal exploitation must be completely eliminated. All cadres should go among the masses for transformation. District Two clarified that promoting democracy is the key to mobilizing the masses, pointing out that in the past, some cadres made suggestions at meetings without allowing the masses to consider and discuss them, and then called for their passage. When the masses raised opposing opinions, they became prejudiced. When work could not be carried out, they blamed the masses for being backward. During the deployment of this land reduction campaign, in a training class for one hundred and twenty members and cadres, the above shortcomings were recognized and overcome. The middle peasant policy was especially studied, and it was unanimously clarified that middle peasants are our own people and should not only not be struggled against but should also be absorbed into the movement.
　　[Report from our newspaper's correspondent in Weixian, 15th] Dong Yisong in Qiuxian County is a small village of more than one hundred households. Under the suppression of five large landlords and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Zhang Wukui, several mass movements failed to gain momentum. When the land reduction movement began this time, the leadership planned to break through the backward villages, strongly supporting the masses and inspiring them to boldly appeal for grievances. Activists were mobilized to connect widely, and more than eighty percent of the masses joined the organization, overthrowing the local bully landlords and realizing "land to the tiller."

　　深入搜查隐蔽地主
    临清等地检查翻身
    【本报冀南威县十五日电】临清查减转向深入阶段。老区六、八、九、十区有半数村庄，正在清查不法地主的疏散地，分给无地或少地的农民。八区胡官庄等村，每人已平均得三亩地以上。现并解决群众内部宗派矛盾，大量吸收中农参加农会。六区郑庄等村，采取一面抽调闹宗派斗争的村干部进行整风反省，一面重新发动群众，培养积极分子。二、三、四、五、七新区，正在贯彻反奸清算、“土地回家”斗争。二区于半月内在李堂等九个村，斗倒二十六个遗漏汉奸恶霸地主，解决了农民土地问题，每人平均三亩地以上。三区凹里等村，清理出十五种果实悬案，重新将全部果实分到群众手里。经过这次查减，预计旧年底，临清可全部彻底实现土地改革。
    【本报威县十五日电】平乡、巨鹿加速进行翻身检查，彻底推行土地改革。巨鹿根据调查结果，发现辛庄八家地主，仍未改变成份，该村仍有两户赤贫，十八户贫农，很多会员干部包办，分配果实不公。针对以上情况，领导上提出一面查减，一面要转变干部作风，务要彻底消灭封建剥削，所有干部应到群众中去改造。二区明确发扬民主是发动群众的关键，指出过去有些干部在大会上提意见，不容群众考虑讨论，就叫通过；群众提相反意见时，便抱成见；工作作不通时则瞒怨群众落后。此次在布置查减时，在一百二十名会员干部训练班上，认识与克服了以上缺点，特别研究了中农政策，一致明确中农是自己人，不但不该斗，而且要吸收参加运动。
    【本报威县十五日电】邱县东伊宋，是百余户的小村，在五家大地主，与蒋特张五奎压制下，几次群运都未打开局面。此次查减运动开始，领导上有计划的突破落后村，给群众大力撑腰，启发群众大胆申冤诉苦，发动积极分子广泛串连，百分之八十以上群众拥入组织，斗垮了恶霸地主，实现了耕者有其田。
