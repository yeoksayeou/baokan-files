Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 29th: According to delayed news from London: Internal dissatisfaction with the foreign policy adopted by the Labour government is growing. At the grassroots level, Middlesex (a Labour Party member) issued a circular to Labour Party members in October, criticizing the government's foreign policy. It stated: Churchill's policy of currying favor with American imperialism and antagonizing the Soviet Union is not only continuing but also developing. The circular also attacked the government for using troops to assist other countries in Indonesia and Vietnam in an attempt to restore their imperialism. It also stated: Britain must never be anti-Soviet. According to a United Press report, well-informed sources in London declared on the 17th: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party held a secret meeting on the 16th and unanimously passed a warning letter, accusing some British diplomats stationed in Europe of engaging in "varying degrees of anti-Soviet conspiracy and propaganda." The committee strongly advocated for major reforms to enable British diplomatic envoys to better represent Labour Party policies.

    力主改革外交政策
    【新华社延安十二月二十九日电】据伦敦迟到消息：工党内部对于政府所采外交政策之不满，正在日益增长中。在下层方面，米德塞斯（工党党员）于十月间曾向工党人士发布通告，抨击政府外交政策。内称：邱吉尔讨好美帝国主义敌视苏联之政策不但在继续推行中，且不断发展中。该通告又攻击政府在印尼及越南以军队协助他国，企图恢复他国之帝国主义。并称：英国绝不能反苏。另据合众社报导，伦敦消息灵通人士十七日宣称：国会工党议员之外交委员之外交委员会于十六日举行秘密会议，一致通过警告书，指责英国驻欧洲外交家若干人正从事“不同程度之反苏阴谋与宣传”，该委会力主大事改革，俾使英国外交使节更能代表工党政策。
