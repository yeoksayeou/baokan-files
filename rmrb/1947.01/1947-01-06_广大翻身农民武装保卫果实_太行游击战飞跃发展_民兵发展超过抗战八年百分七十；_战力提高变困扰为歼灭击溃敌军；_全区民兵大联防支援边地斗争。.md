[Report from our newspaper] Xinhua News Agency special correspondent Zhu Muzhi reported on the new developments in the guerrilla war in the Taihang area, stating: Due to the emancipation of the peasants and the weakness of the Chiang Kai-shek army's combat effectiveness, the guerrilla war in the Taihang area is significantly different from that during the Anti-Japanese War. Its main characteristic is that the guerrilla war is more closely integrated with the broad masses of the people, and the development of people's armed forces is unusually rapid. In the emancipation movement, eighty to ninety percent of the people obtained the fruits of struggle, and they urgently demand to master weapons to defend these fruits. The Chiang Kai-shek army and the so-called "Homecoming Corps," "Revenge Squads," and "Assassination Groups" composed of some landlords and despots who did not understand the overall situation, carried out cruel massacres and reversals of accounts, further forcing every emancipated person to arm themselves for a life-and-death self-defense struggle. According to statistics from last July, the number of militia in the entire region increased by 72% compared to the anti-Japanese counter-offensive last year. This means that the militia developed in the past year is equivalent to three-quarters of the total militia developed in the past eight years. Another characteristic is that the combat effectiveness of the people's armed forces has been unprecedentedly improved. During the Anti-Japanese War, the militia could only mainly consume and harass the enemy, but now they are gradually shifting to annihilating and defeating the enemy. Militia in various places can not only frequently encircle and annihilate small groups of enemies, but also often repel attacks by large groups of enemies. The Chiang Kai-shek army, with its low morale, despite having American weapons, cannot withstand the unexpected and brave attacks and explosive injuries of the militia, and easily lays down its weapons and collapses. Therefore, the militia in many places have changed their past method of running away after fighting and have adopted the tactic of charging after fighting. Statistics from October show that the militia in the entire region annihilated 963 enemies, exceeding the records of previous months. Due to the continuous annihilation of the enemy, the militia's weapons have also been greatly replenished. Now the militia generally have rifles, and many militia are equipped with machine guns and small cannons, and some militia even carry American weapons. Statistics from July show that the militia's rifles increased by 163% compared to the anti-Japanese counter-offensive last year, and machine guns increased by 100%. The third characteristic is the region-wide militia joint defense. During the Anti-Japanese War, the activities of the militia were limited to their own villages and counties, but now the militia can be arbitrarily transferred to various places. Many militia from the interior areas take turns going to the border areas to support the local people, helping them fight and emancipate themselves, teaching them guerrilla warfare and landmine warfare; and forming armed work teams to penetrate the enemy's heartland, replacing the armed work teams formed by regular troops in the past. Before July, there were 5,000 to 7,000 militia supporting the border areas every day. This kind of large-scale joint defense will undoubtedly develop into a large-scale, fierce, and irresistible guerrilla war.

    广大翻身农民武装保卫果实
    太行游击战飞跃发展
    民兵发展超过抗战八年百分七十；
    战力提高变困扰为歼灭击溃敌军；
    全区民兵大联防支援边地斗争。
    【本报讯】新华社特派记者朱穆之报导太行区游击战争的新发展称：由于农民的翻身和蒋军战斗力的薄弱，太行区的游击战争已与抗日时期有了显著的不同。其主要的特点是游击战争更加与广大人民结合，人民武装的发展异常迅速。在翻身运动中，百分之八九十的人民获得了斗争果实，他们迫切要求掌握武装以保卫这些果实。而蒋军及一些不明大体的地主恶霸组成的所谓还乡团、复仇队、暗杀团的残酷屠杀与倒算，更迫使每个翻身人民不得不武装起来进行生死的自卫斗争。据去年七月份统计，全区民兵数量较去年对日反攻时增加百分之七十二，这就是说，一年来所发展的民兵即相当于过去八年内所发展的民兵总额的四分之三。另一个特点是人民武装的战斗力空前提高。在抗日时期，民兵还只能以消耗与困扰敌人为主，现在则逐渐转向消灭与击溃敌人。各地民兵不仅经常可以包围消灭小股敌人，而且已常常可以击退大股敌人的进攻。士气低落的蒋军，尽管有着美式武器，也经不起民兵不意的勇敢袭击和爆炸的杀伤，很易放下武器与溃散。因此许多地方的民兵改变了过去打了就跑的办法，而采取打了就冲。十月份的统计，全区民兵消灭敌人达九百六十三名，超过以往几个月的纪录。由于不断消灭敌人，民兵的武器也获得大量补充。现在民兵普遍有了步枪，许多民兵并配备有机枪与小炮，有的民兵更扛上了美式武器。七月份的统计，民兵的步枪比去年对日反攻时增加百分之一百六十三，机枪则增加了百分之百。第三个特点是全区民兵大联防。在抗日时期民兵的活动还只限于本村本县，而现在民兵则可任意调动到各地。许多腹地民兵轮番开赴边沿区支援当地人民，帮助他们作战、翻身，教他们学习游击战及地雷战；并组成武工队深入敌人的腹心区活动，代替了过去正规军组成的武工队。在七月份以前，这种支援边地的民兵每天有五千到七千人。这种大联防无疑将发展为一种大规模猛烈不可抗拒的游击战争。
