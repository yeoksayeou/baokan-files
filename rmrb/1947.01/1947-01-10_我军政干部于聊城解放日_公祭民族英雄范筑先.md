    Our Military and Political Cadres Publicly Commemorate National Hero Fan Zhuxian on the Liberation Day of Liaocheng
    [Our correspondent on the front lines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 6th] After our army liberated Liaocheng on New Year's Day, all military and political cadres solemnly commemorated the anti-Japanese national hero General Fan Zhuxian on the 2nd. The public memorial was held in front of General Fan's tomb in the city, presided over by Zhang Linzhi, representative of the Eighth Route Army, and Xie Xinhe, Commissioner of the Second Administrative Region of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. Many of those participating in the memorial were young people who followed General Fan in the anti-Japanese war. They expressed their infinite grief and admiration for this national hero who was jointly murdered by Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese puppets. The speaker, Zhang Linzhi, said in his address: "If General Fan could know in death that Liaocheng and his remains were still ruled by traitors for more than a year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War; that after Japan was defeated, an American aggressor came; and that after Wang Jingwei died, Chiang Kai-shek came, he would definitely hold resentment even in the afterlife!" Zhang pointed out: "In order to commemorate the national hero General Fan Zhuxian, all Chinese people must work harder to combat the American aggressors and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" It is reported that General Fan Zhuxian originally served as the Commissioner of the Sixth Administrative Region of Shandong Province of the Kuomintang and concurrently as the Commander of the Security Forces. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War and the fall of Jinan to the Japanese invaders, Kuomintang officials in northern Shandong fled, but General Fan organized an army of 100,000 men and cooperated with the Eighth Route Army to resist Japan. This aroused the jealousy of Chiang Kai-shek, who ordered Fan's subordinate, Wang Jinxiang, to surrender to the enemy, leading to the fall of Liaocheng to the Japanese invaders on November 15, 1938. General Fan was then jointly murdered by Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese puppets, and died a glorious death for his country.

    我军政干部于聊城解放日
    公祭民族英雄范筑先
    【本报冀鲁豫前线六日电】我军元旦日解放聊城后，全体军政干部于二日隆重公祭抗日民族英雄范筑先将军。公祭在城内范将军墓前举行，由八路军代表张霖之、冀鲁豫二专区专员谢鑫鹤主祭，与祭者多为当年追随范将军抗日的青年，他们对这位被蒋日伪串通杀害的民族英雄，表示无限的悲悼与景仰。主祭人张霖之的致词：“范将军如果死而有知，知道抗战胜利后，聊城和他的遗骸还被汉奸统治了一年多。日本打败了又来了个美国侵略者；汪精卫死了又来了个蒋介石，他一定要含恨于九泉！”张氏指出：“为了纪念民族英雄范筑先将军，全中国人民必须更加努力打击美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国贼！”按范筑先将军原任国民党山东省六专区专员兼保安司令，抗战后日寇侵陷济南，山东北部国民党官吏逃跑一空，范将军即组织十万人的武装，和八路军合作抗日，深为蒋介石嫉视，勒令范部王逆金祥投敌，致聊城于一九三八年十一月十五日为日寇攻陷，范将军遂遭蒋日伪串通杀害，光荣殉国。
