Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: New York delayed dispatch: The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) of the United States, with over six million members, passed a resolution during its national convention held in Atlantic City from November 18th to 23rd last year, advocating for a "free, unified, and independent new China." It demanded that the U.S. government immediately cease interfering in China's internal affairs and refrain from providing military aid to any party. Other important resolutions on foreign policy passed by the convention included: (1) Calling on the three powers to abide by previous resolutions to eliminate the remaining forces of German and Japanese fascism in order to ensure lasting peace. (2) Requesting the government to follow Roosevelt's foreign policy and strengthen the cooperation of the three powers. (3) Supporting world disarmament, opposing the establishment of strong naval and land forces, and establishing bases abroad. (4) Demanding independence and autonomy for the colonial peoples of the world. (5) Demanding the immediate destruction of already manufactured atomic bombs. The CIO president, Murray, warned in his speech at the convention that the Republican Party would make a grave mistake if it took advantage of its victory in this congressional election to wantonly create anti-labor bills.

    【新华社延安八日电】纽约迟到消息：拥有六百余万会员的美国产业工会联合会，于去年十一月十八日到二十三日在大西洋城召开全国代表大会时，曾通过决议，主张“自由统一及独立的新中国”，要求美政府立即停止干涉中国内政，不得再予任何方面以军事援助。会议通过之其他有关外交政策的重要决议尚有：（一）吁请三强遵守以往的决议，灭除德、日法西斯残余势力，以保障永久和平。（二）要求政府遵循罗斯福的外交政策，加强三强的合作。（三）赞成世界裁军，反对建立强大的海陆军，及在国外设立基地。（四）要求世界上的殖民地人民独立自主。（五）要求立即毁灭已经制成的原子弹。该会主席莫莱于大会演说中，警告共和党如果利用这次国会选举的胜利，肆意制造反劳工法案，将铸成大错。
