Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 8th: The Liberation Daily published an editorial entitled "The Bugle Sounds, Advance Bravely," discussing the student movement in Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai against U.S. military atrocities. Excerpts are as follows:

    In the eyes of American imperialists, our compatriots are not even human. In China, not a single day has passed without U.S. military atrocities. This time, they openly raped a young female student in broad daylight, symbolizing the humiliation of the Chinese nation by American imperialists.

    The Chiang Kai-shek clique has done everything possible to defend and excuse the crimes of the U.S. military, prohibiting newspapers from disclosing them, strictly enforcing "friendly relations," and suppressing patriotic demonstrations by compatriots in various places. Who doesn't have brothers? Who doesn't have sisters? Chiang Kai-shek, this autocratic and traitorous warlord, has not only sold out our motherland's territory and sovereignty but also our brothers' and sisters' bodies. Here, we extend our deepest condolences to the female student who was humiliated in Beijing and her family. And we tell them: Your shame is the shame of the people in the liberated areas, the shame of the entire nation! We will never give up until this hatred is avenged! At the same time, we express our strongest protest with boundless anger to the American imperialists and their running dogs: You must immediately severely punish the perpetrators, you must immediately compensate for the losses, and the U.S. military must immediately get out of China!

    Patriotic students in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong have held large-scale strikes and demonstrations one after another to protest this atrocity and demand the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. military from China. As of the 5th, at least 300,000 people have participated in various places. If the participation of people from all walks of life is included, it will exceed the total number of Chiang Kai-shek's American-equipped divisions. This magnificent mass action is like the Yellow River after the thaw, with wave after wave surging forward. American-made machine guns, Chiang Kai-shek's military police and secret agents, and even U.S. military armored patrols appear so cowardly and insignificant in front of the ranks of the indignant masses. It symbolizes that when the Chinese nation stands up like a giant, all reactionaries can only collapse like insects and dust! This is another vigorous movement of Chinese youth after the "May Fourth," "May 30th," and "December 9th" movements, which will, like the "May Fourth," "May 30th," and "December 9th" movements, open a new page in Chinese history as a prelude.

    In the past half month, the victorious march of young students has further inspired the courage of the Chinese people to fight against American imperialist aggressors and reactionaries and has strengthened the Chinese people's confidence in the victory of the independent, peaceful, and democratic movement. We would like to offer a word to the patriotic youth of the whole country: Your heroic actions have already marked a new starting point for the Chinese people in 1947. You have provided a living example to the hundreds of millions of compatriots living under Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary autocratic rule, creating a model of how to break through the reactionary blockade and move towards the light. The people of China will accept your great influence and strive relentlessly despite difficulties! You yourselves should cherish this experience, further strengthen unity, strengthen your confidence in the future of peace, independence, and democracy, and further develop your heroic spirit and continue to struggle unyieldingly! Any difficulties can be overcome, any obstacles can be crushed, and any secret agents and any prohibitions are bound to collapse in the face of the invincible power of the people. Our military and civilians in the liberated areas have already gained their own valuable experience in this regard. Didn't American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek think that they could do whatever they wanted and even try to eliminate the liberated areas with American equipment and dollar loans? However, in the past six months, the iron fists of the military and civilians in the liberated areas have wiped out more than fifty brigades of Chiang's main force. Chiang Kai-shek's American equipment has now gradually been transferred to our hands and has become a weapon to defeat the reactionary offensive. And the soldiers who were forced by Chiang Kai-shek to be conscripted to become cannon fodder have largely become conscious and determined fighters in our ranks. The reason why the military and civilians in the liberated areas have achieved these victories is not because of any magic weapon, but only because of solid unity, full confidence, vigorous offensive spirit, and unyielding action to sacrifice for the people and serve the people. These four combined with the people produce infinite and invincible power! What you need is to work towards this direction. Young people of the whole country, let us unite like an iron torrent, fight more stubbornly, and welcome the birth of a bright and brilliant new China!

    The history of the past thirty years has proved that Chinese youth are ultimately the trumpeters of dawn in an earth-shattering era. The bugle has sounded, let us fight forward for the honor of the motherland!

    号角响了，奋勇前进！
    解放日报论平津京沪学生抗议美军兽行运动
    【新华社延安八日电】解放日报以《号角响了奋勇前进》为题发表社论，论述平津京沪学生反对美军兽行的运动。摘要如下：
    在美帝国主义眼里，我们的同胞本来就不是人，一年以来在中国境内哪一天没有美军暴行太阳就落不下山。这次他们公然在露天强奸一个青年女学生，这象征着美帝国主义者对中华民族的污辱。
    蒋介石集团百般为美军罪行辩护开脱，禁止报纸披露，严申“亲睦邦交”令，镇压各地同胞爱国游行示威。谁无兄弟？谁无姊妹？蒋介石这一专制独裁的卖国贼，不仅把我祖国的领土主权出卖干净，连我们兄弟姐妹的身体也都出卖干净了。我们在此谨以万分悲痛的心情向这回在北平横受凌辱的女同学及其家属遥致亲切的慰问。并且告诉他们：你们的耻辱就是解放区人民的耻辱，就是全民族的耻辱！此仇不报，决不罢休！同时，我们以无比的愤怒向美帝国主义者及其走狗表示最严重的抗议：你们必须立即严惩凶犯，必须立即赔偿损失，美军必须立即滚出中国！
    平津京沪香港的爱国学生，为了抗议这一暴行，为了要求美军立即退出中国，接连不断地举行大规模的罢课游行示威，各地参加者迄五日止最少有三十万人，若连各界市民参加的合计在内，则将超过蒋介石美械师的总人数。雄伟的群众行动，有如解冻后的黄河，后浪推着前浪，汹涌澎湃而来。美制的机关枪，蒋介石的军警特务，乃至美军的装甲巡逻，在悲愤填膺的群众的行列前面，显得多么卑怯和渺小。象征着当中华民族像巨人一样站起来的时候，一切反动派都只能如虫豸和尘埃一样垮掉了！这是中国青年继“五四”“五卅”“一二九”以后又一次轰轰烈烈的大运动，将和“五四”“五卅”“一二九”一样作为一个先声开辟中国历史的新页。
    半月来，青年学生的胜利行进，更加振奋了全中国人民向美帝国主义侵略者和反动派搏斗的勇气，更加加强了中国人民独立和平民主运动必胜的信心。我们愿向全国爱国青年进一词：你们英勇的行动已经迈开了一九四七年中国人民新的起点，你们给数万万生活在蒋介石反动独裁统治下的同胞以活的榜样，创下了如何冲破反动封锁向光明迈进的模范；全中国人民将接受你们的巨大影响，不避险阻再接再厉地奋斗！你们自己应该宝贵这个经验，更加加强团结，更加坚定向和平独立民主前途奋斗的信心，更加发扬你们的英勇气慨，继续不屈不挠地斗争下去！任何困难都是可以克服的，任何障碍都是可以粉碎的，任何特务任何禁令在不可战胜的人民力量面前是必然要崩溃的。我们解放区军民在这方面已经取得了自己的宝贵经验，美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石不是以为有了美械装备、美元借款就可以为所欲为甚至妄图消灭解放区么？但是，半年以来解放区军民的铁拳已歼灭了蒋记主力五十个旅以上；蒋介石的美械装备今天已经逐渐转到我们手里，变成打垮反动派进攻的利器。而往日被蒋介石强迫抽丁去当炮灰的士兵，已经大批变成我们行列内的自觉与坚决战斗的战士。解放区军民之所以得到这些胜利，并没有别的法宝，只有巩固的团结，充分的信心，旺盛的攻击精神，和不屈不挠地为人民牺牲、为人民服务的行动。这四者和人民结合在一起，就产生了无穷无尽的不可战胜的力量！你们所需要的，也就是要向这方面努力。全国青年们，让我们像一支铁流似的汇合一起，更加顽强地战斗，迎接光明灿烂的新中国的诞生罢！
    三十年来的历史，证明了中国青年终是在惊天动地的大时代里报导黎明的号角手。号角已经响了，为了祖国的荣誉奋斗前进啊！
