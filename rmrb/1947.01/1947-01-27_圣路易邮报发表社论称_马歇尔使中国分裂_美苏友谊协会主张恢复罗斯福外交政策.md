Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th (Delayed) According to a U.S. news agency dispatch on the 15th, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch commented on Marshall's report and Vandenberg's speech in Cleveland on the 13th, stating that the CCP and the China Democratic League refused to participate in the "one-party constitutional conference" because "the organization of the conference was not democratic." The newspaper editorial also stated: "The new constitution is a trick to allow the reactionaries within the Kuomintang to exploit the beautiful name of democracy to prolong the one-party dictatorship." The solutions suggested by Marshall and Vandenberg are turning a blind eye to the division of China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th A New York dispatch: "The National Committee of the American-Soviet Friendship Association has sent a telegram to the new U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, urging him to continue Roosevelt's policy of American-Soviet cooperation. The telegram stated: Roosevelt's peace plan was based on the belief that world security depends on American-Soviet cooperation. We believe that most Americans are, like us, deeply troubled. In the events of the past few months, Roosevelt's policy has been abandoned."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th A Washington dispatch: Truman met with Marshall yesterday morning for the second meeting since Marshall took office. It is reported that Marshall is now focusing on studying the foreign political situation.

    圣路易邮报发表社论称
    马歇尔使中国分裂
    美苏友谊协会主张恢复罗斯福外交政策
    【新华社延安十八日电】（迟到）据美新闻处十五日电，圣路易邮报于十三日评论马歇尔之报告及范登堡在克里夫兰所发表之演说称：中共及中国民主同盟拒绝参加“一党宪章会议”，“因该会议之组织并不民主”。该报社论又称：“新宪法为一种诡计，使国民党内反动派得能利用民主之美名，以延长一党之独裁。”马歇尔及范登堡所建议之办法，即对中国之分裂视若无睹。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】纽约讯：“美苏友谊协会全国委员会顷致电美新国务卿马歇尔，敦促他继续罗斯福的美苏合作政策。电文称：罗斯福的和平计划，是基于相信世界的安全，有赖于美苏合作。我们相信大部分的美国人与我们一样是深深的被困恼着。在过去几个月的事实中，罗斯福的政策是被抛弃了。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】华府讯：杜鲁门于昨晨接见马歇尔，作马氏接任以后之第二次晤谈。按第一次晤谈于马氏宣誓就职之后举行。据悉，马氏现正专心致力于国外政治形势的研究。
