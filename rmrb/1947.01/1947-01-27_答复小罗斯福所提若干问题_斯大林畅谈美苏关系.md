Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: TASS, New York, 22nd: *Look* magazine published an account by Elliott Roosevelt of a conversation he had with Stalin on December 21, 1946, including answers to twelve questions Roosevelt posed. The original text is as follows:

    (1) Question: Does Your Excellency believe that democratic countries like the United States can coexist in this world with communist countries like the Soviet Union, without attempting to interfere in each other's internal affairs?

    Stalin's Answer: Of course, it is possible. Not only is it possible, but it is entirely within the realm of possibility. In the most difficult times of the war, differences in government did not prevent our two countries from uniting and defeating our enemies; in peacetime, it is even more possible to continue this relationship.

    (2) Question: Do you believe that the success of the United Nations depends on agreement between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States on fundamental policies and goals?

    Stalin's Answer: Yes, I think so. In many ways, the fate of the United Nations organization depends on the state of harmony achieved among the three powers.

    (3) Question: Does Marshal believe that reaching a larger-scale economic agreement between our two countries for the exchange of manufactured goods and raw materials is an important step towards world peace?

    Stalin's Answer: Yes, I think it's important. I certainly agree that expanding world trade is beneficial in many ways to the development of good relations between our two countries.

    (4) Question: Does the Soviet Union support the immediate establishment by the United Nations Security Council of an international police force composed of all United Nations members, which can be immediately dispatched to any place where armed warfare threatens peace?

    Stalin's Answer: Of course.

    (5) Question: If you believe that atomic bombs should be controlled by the United Nations, should they also control, through a system of inspection, all research and manufacturing facilities of any kind of armaments, as well as the peacetime use and development of atomic energy? (Here, Elliott Roosevelt wrote in parentheses: "Stalin quickly asked me, 'General?' I replied, 'Yes, but especially regarding the Soviet Union's agreement in principle to such a plan.'")

    Stalin's Answer: Of course, based on the principle of equality, there can be no exceptions on the Soviet side. The Soviet Union should be subject to the same inspection and control rules that any other country must be subject to. (Here, Roosevelt wrote in parentheses: "There was no hesitation in his answer, not even a mention of reserving the right of veto.")

    (6) Question: Do you believe it would be useful to convene another Three-Power conference to discuss all the international issues that currently threaten world peace?

    Stalin's Answer: I think it should be not just one, but several meetings. If several meetings are held, they will be very useful. (Here, Roosevelt wrote in parentheses: "At this point, I asked whether he thought such meetings would help to achieve closer relations among lower-ranking officials in the governments concerned? And I asked whether wartime conferences had achieved such results? He smiled at me and replied: "There is no question about it. The wartime conferences and the results achieved greatly helped cooperation among lower-ranking personnel.")

    (7) Question: We know that you are a scholar who studies many other political and social problems existing in other countries. Therefore, I would like to ask whether you believe that the US elections last November indicate that the people no longer believe in Roosevelt's policies and have turned to the isolationist policies of his political opponents?

    Stalin's Answer: I am not very familiar with the domestic life of the American people, but I think the elections have shown that the current government is "wasting" the moral and political capital established by the late President, thus facilitating the victory of the Republicans. (Here, Roosevelt wrote in parentheses: "The Marshal spoke with particular emphasis when answering my next question.")

    (8) Question: What do you think are the reasons for the weakening of relations and mutual understanding between our two countries after Roosevelt's death?

    Stalin's Answer: I think that if this question is about the relations and understanding between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union, then there has been no deterioration; on the contrary, relations have improved. As for relations between the two governments, there have been some misunderstandings, some deterioration has occurred, and then there has been a great deal of fanfare, shouting that relations will worsen in the future; but here, we do not have anything terrible enough to destroy peace or cause conflict. No major power, even if its government tries to do so, can currently gather a large army to fight another ally, another major power. Because there are no people at present, no one can wage war, and the people are unwilling to wage war; they are tired of war. Moreover, there are no clear and understandable goals to serve as an excuse for a new war; people will not know why they are fighting. Therefore, I do not think that the talk of some representatives of the US government about the deterioration of relations between our two countries is anything terrible. In view of all this, I think the danger of a new war is unrealistic.

    (9) Question: Do you agree with the exchange of cultural and scientific information between the two countries, and do you agree with the exchange of students and professors?

    Stalin's Answer: Of course.

    (10) Question: Should the United States and the Soviet Union form a long-term cooperative policy to help the people of the Far East?

    Stalin's Answer: I think it would be beneficial if possible. In any case, our government is not prepared to pursue a common policy with the United States on Far Eastern issues.

    (11) Question: If the United States and the Soviet Union agreed on a system of equalization and credit loans, would such an agreement be of lasting benefit to the American economy?

    Stalin's Answer: Of course, such a credit loan system would be mutually beneficial to both the United States and the Soviet Union. (Here, Roosevelt wrote in parentheses: "Then I asked about the obvious concerns arising in many countries in Europe.")

    (12) Question: Is the failure to implement denazification in the American and British occupation zones of Germany a serious cause of anxiety for the Soviet Union?

    Stalin's Answer: No, it is not a serious cause of anxiety. But when this part of our common program is not implemented, it is certainly unpleasant for the Soviet Union.

    答复小罗斯福所提若干问题
    斯大林畅谈美苏关系
    【新华社延安二十五日电】塔斯社纽约二十二日电：《盼望》杂志刊登伊里奥特·罗斯福叙述他在一九四六年十二月二十一日与斯大林的一篇谈话，其中包括对罗斯福所问的十二个问题的答复。其原文如下：
    （一）问：阁下是否认为如像美国这样的民主国，有可能与像苏联这样的共产主义国家在这一世界上共同生存、而且能不企图干涉对方的内政呢？
    斯大林答：当然是可能的。这不仅是可能的，而且完全是在能够实现的范围以内。在战时最艰苦的时候，政府的不同并没有阻止我们两国联合一起，并战胜我们的敌人；在和平时期，继续这样关系，是有更大的可能。
    （二）问：你是否认为联合国的成功，依赖于苏英美之间在基本政策与目标上意见一致呢？
    斯大林答：是的，我想是这样的。在许多方面，联合国组织的命运依赖于三强之间所达到的和谐的状态。
    （三）问：大元帅你是否认为我两国间为互相交换制造品与原料而达成更广大规模的经济协定，乃是走向世界和平的重要步骤呢？
    斯大林答：是，我认为这是重要的。我当然同意世界贸易的扩大会在许多方面有益于我两国之间的良好关系的发展。
    （四）问：苏联是否赞成联合国安理会即刻建立由一切联合国所组成的国际警察力量可以即刻开至任何有武装战争威胁和平的地方呢？
    斯大林答：当然。
    （五）问：如果你认为原子炸弹应该由联合国加以管制，那末他们是否应当通过视察制度来管制任何性质的军备之一切研究与制造的工具以及原子能的平时使用与发展呢？（在这里伊里奥特·罗斯福在括弧中写道：“斯大林迅速反问我‘一般的吗’？”我答道：“是，但特别是关于苏联对于这种计划之原则的同意”。）
    斯大林答：当然，根据平等的原则，在苏联方面不能有任何例外，苏联应该服从任何其他国家所必须服从的同一的视察与管制的规则。（在这里罗斯福在括弧中写道：“在他的回答中没有丝毫犹豫，甚至一点也没有提到保留否决权问题”。）
    （六）问：你是否认为如果召集另一次三强会议，讨论一切在目前威胁世界和平的国际问题是有用处的？
    斯大林答：我认为应当不是召开一次，而是召开几次会议。如果召开几次会议，那末他们将是非常有用处的。（在这里，罗斯福在括弧中写道：“在这时，我便问道，他是否认为这种会议会帮助在各有关政府的官员中较下级官员间达到更亲密的关系呢？我并且问战时历次会议是否达到过这种结果？他面向我微笑着答道：“这一点没有问题，战时的会议及所达到的结果，大大地帮助了下级人员间的合作”。）
    （七）问：我们知道，你是研究其他国家内所存在的其他许多政治与社会问题的学者，因此我愿意问一问你是否认为去年十一月美国的选举，表示人民已不相信罗斯福的政策而转去相信他的政敌的孤立主义者政策呢？
    斯大林答：我不甚熟悉美国人民的国内生活，但是我认为选举已表示现在的政府是在“浪费”了故总统所建立的道义上的与政治上的资本，因此它便利了共和党人获得胜利。（在这里，罗福斯在括弧中写道：“大元帅在回答我下一个问题时，表示特别着重的语气”。）
    （八）问：你认为在罗斯福逝世之后，我们两国之间及其关系与相互谅解减弱的原因是什么呢？
    斯大林答：我认为如果这一问题所讲的是关于美国与苏联两国人民之间的关系与谅解的话，那末并没有发生任何恶化；相反的，关系是改善了。至于两国政府之间的关系，曾经有一些误解，曾经发生过某些恶化的现象，在这以后发起大吹大擂的喧嚷，高喊什么今后关系将更加恶化；但是在这里，我们并没有任何可怕的东西，足以破坏和平或引起冲突。任何一个强国，即令其政府力图这样做，在目前也不可能召集大量军队去对另一个盟国、另一个强国打仗。因为现时没有人民，无论谁都不可能进行战争，而人民是不愿意进行战争的，他们已厌倦战争了。此外，也没有任何明确而且可以理解的目标来作新的战争的借口，人们将不知道他们为什么要打仗。所以，我认为美国政府的某些代表谈论我两国之间关系恶化，这并不是什么可怕的东西。鉴于这一切，我认为新战争的危险是不现实的。
    （九）问：你是否赞成在这两国之间交换文化与科学的情报，你是否赞成彼此交换学生与教授？
    斯大林答：当然。
    （十）问：美国与苏联是否应当形成长期的合作政策，以帮助远东各国的人民？
    斯大林答：我认为如果可能的话，这是有益处的。无论如何，我国政府不准备在远东问题上与美国遵行共同的政策的。
    （十一）问：如果美苏之间商定了平准与信用借款制度的话，那末这种协定对于美国的经济会有持久的裨益吗？
    斯大林答：当然，这种信用借款制度对于美苏双方都会互相有利。（在这里，罗斯福在括弧中写道：“然后我问了在欧洲许多国家中产生明显的关怀的问题”。）
    （十二）问：德国美英占领区未能实行废除纳粹化，这是否造成苏联惊慌不安的严重的原因？
    斯大林答：不，这并不是造成严重不安的原因。但当我们共同纲领的这一部分没有实行，对于苏联当然是不愉快的。
