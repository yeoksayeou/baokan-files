    【This newspaper, Taihang News】From the 2nd of last month to the 12th of this month, our Taigu Independent Battalion took the initiative to attack and won four battles in four battles. In addition to seizing 3 machine guns and 1 small cannon, they also created a new record of 78 to 0 in enemy-to-us casualties. The details are as follows: (1) At 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month, the 1st Battalion, 2nd and 6th Companies of the Yan Security Corps' 23rd Regiment at the Xiaobai stronghold surrounded our Dongli Village from the east and west. Our company and the militia work team had previously detected the enemy's attempt and took the initiative to set up an ambush in the village. When the enemy was about to enter the village, we used a small amount of firepower to control the enemy's eastern route; seeing that we were prepared, the 6th Company first fled. All our commanders and fighters immediately concentrated their firepower and wiped out 35 enemy soldiers from the 2nd Company, seizing 2 machine guns, 6 rifles, 1 light cannon, and 1 grenade launcher. (2) On New Year's Eve, our × Company ambushed the Yan Special Agent Team that came out of Ren Village to harass us at Budaizhuang, wiping out most of them, killing 12, capturing the special agent captain and 4 others, and seizing 7 rifles and more than 100 rounds of ammunition. (3) On the 12th of last month, we took the initiative to ambush the enemy at Xiaobai, killing 8, wounding 10, capturing 3, and seizing 1 machine gun, 5 rifles, and more than 100 rounds of ammunition. (4) On the 2nd of last month, in the battle of Yin Village, we also killed 2 stubborn Yan soldiers, wounded 3, and captured 1, seizing 1 rifle. In all of the above four battles, we suffered no casualties.

    【This newspaper, Taihang, 30th dispatch】The young and middle-aged militia self-defense forces in the eastern foothills of Taigu have formed militia joint defense teams, militia work teams, and rotation defense teams, and have launched guerrilla warfare deep behind enemy lines. In three months, they have fought a total of 93 battles, including 32 organized explosion battles, killing and wounding 112 enemy soldiers at the company commander level and below, capturing 13, and seizing 1 machine gun, 1 small cannon, 9 rifles, 66 hand grenades, more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition, and 1 telephone. They intercepted 154 sheep and rescued 35 captured youths.

    【Another dispatch】The preliminary experience of the mass guerrilla warfare in Taigu County is: (1) Boldly enter behind enemy lines, disperse activities, which is easy to go deep, convenient to understand the situation, protect the interests of the masses in a timely manner, and capture sporadic plainclothes secret agents. In case of any situation, fire from one place is supported from all sides. (2) All small-scale activities must be led by strong cadres. Whenever a village or place is visited, team members are immediately organized to carry out political work among the masses, so that guerrilla warfare gradually takes root among the masses, so as to avoid the phenomenon that after we leave, it is still a "blank area" due to purely military activities. (3) Seize the gaps to consolidate and train the militia, and make review work and technical coaching a regular task. At the same time, commendations and rewards should be given at any time after each action to set off a competition to kill the enemy and make meritorious service.

    太谷独立营四战四捷
    创零比七十八新纪录
    【本报太行讯】从上月二日到本月十二日，我太谷独立营主动出击，四战四捷，除缴获机枪三挺，小炮一尊等战利品外，并创造敌我七十八比○的新战绩。计（一）本月十二日上午十时，小白据点阎保安团二十三团一大队二、六中队分东、西两路围我东里村。我某连与武工队事先窥悉敌人企图，主动先机设伏村内，待敌正要进村，我以少数火力控制敌人东路；敌见我有备，六中队首先逃窜。我全体指战员立即集中火力，歼敌二中队三十五名，缴机枪两挺，步枪六枝，轻炮一门，掷弹筒一个。（二）大年三十日，我×连在布袋庄伏击从任村出扰的阎特工队，将其大半歼灭，计毙十二名，俘特工队长以下四名，缴步枪七枝，子弹百多发。（三）上月十二日我主动伏击小白敌人，打死敌八名，伤十名，俘三名，缴机枪一挺，步枪五枝，子弹百余发。（四）上月二日，在殷村战斗中亦打死阎顽二名，伤三名，俘一名，缴步枪一枝，上述四次我均无一伤亡。

    【本报太行三十日电】太谷东山麓青壮年民兵自卫队，组成民兵联防队、武工队、轮防队，深入敌后开展游击战争。三个月共计作战九十三次，有组织开展的爆炸战三十二次，毙伤敌连长以下一百一十二名，俘十三名，缴获机枪一挺，小炮一门，步枪九支，手榴弹六十六颗，子弹三千余发，电话机一部，截回羊一百五十四只，解救被抓青年三十五人。

    【又电】太谷县群众游击战争的初步经验是：（一）大胆进入敌后，分散活动，这样易于深入，便于了解情况，及时保护群众利益，与捕捉零星便衣特务，遇有情况，一处响枪、四面支援。（二）一切小型活动，必须有坚强干部带领，每到一村一地活动，随即组织队员对群众进行政治工作，使游击战争在群众中逐渐生根，以免因单纯军事活动，形成我离开后仍是“空白区”的现象。（三）抓紧空隙整训民兵，把审察工作和技术教练成为经常性工作。同时，要在每次行动后，随时表扬奖励，以掀起杀敌立功竞赛。
