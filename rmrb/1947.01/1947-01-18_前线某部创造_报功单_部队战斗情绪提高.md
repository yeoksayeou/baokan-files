　　A Certain Unit on the Front Lines Creates "Merit Report Cards"
    Boosts Troops' Morale
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Heroes' merits are reported to their families—Unit 1112 prints large red "Merit Report Cards." The soldiers of Unit 1112 on the Jiluyu Front are mostly from Lin County. This unit has a very good relationship with the Lin County government and communicates frequently. After each battle, such as Shangdang, Pinghan, and Longhai, they notify the county government of the victory and report it to the elders and brothers in Lin County on their behalf. This makes the people in their hometown very happy. Recently, propagandist Shuangnian received a letter from home saying: "Shuangnian: I received your letter and know that your company has fought five victorious battles. We are very happy. I hope my son will obey the command of his superiors in the army, get along well with his comrades and the common people, and not scare the villagers. Come home and see me after the war. I will cook a good meal for my child." Shuangnian was very happy to receive the letter and worked even harder. The unit receives several letters like this every day. Unit 1112 adopted this experience and invented a Merit Report Card, specifically reporting the merits of the heroes to their families, districts, and counties, so that relatives and friends would know. The establishment of the Merit Report Card greatly boosted the troops' morale. Hero Ma Tonghua, who killed the enemy, said: "I want to add merit to merit and put the Merit Report Card on my door." New recruit Yang Erda also resolved to perform meritorious service in future battles and strive to report his merits to his family. The homes of the newly liberated comrades are all in the South, so they tried to report their merits back home. They adopted the method of leaders writing letters of condolence. Many newly liberated comrades said: "The merits of the Central Army are for the officials, but in the Eighth Route Army, everyone can be a hero and perform meritorious service. We must work hard."

　　前线某部创造“报功单”
    部队战斗情绪提高
    【本报特讯】英雄功劳报上家门，一一一二部印制大红“报功单”。冀鲁豫前线一一一二部队战士大都是林县人，这个部队和林县县政府关系很好，经常通信，上党、平汉、陇海等每次战役结束后，就将这胜利消息通知县政府，代为报告林县父老兄弟们，这样使家乡的人都很高兴，近日宣传员双年家中来信说：“双年：我接到你的来信，知道你们连打了五个胜仗，我们很高兴。希望我儿在军队上要听上级指挥，跟同志们老百姓好，不要吓唬老乡，以后打完仗回家看一看，我给俺孩子做顿好饭吃。”双年接到家信非常高兴，工作格外起劲，像这样的信该部每天都能接到几封。一一一二部队接受了这个经验，发明了一个报功单，把英雄们的功劳专门报到他家里、区里、县里，让亲戚朋友都知道。报功单的建立，大大鼓舞部队的战斗情绪。杀敌英雄马同华说：“我要功上加功，把报功单贴在我家门上。”新战士杨尔达也决心在以后战斗立功，争取上家报功。新解放同志的家都在南方，立上功设法报回去。他们采用了首长写信慰问的办法。很多新解放的同志都说：“中央军功劳是当官的，在八路军里人人能当英雄立功，一定要好好干。”
