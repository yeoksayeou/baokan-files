Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th (Delayed Dispatch): Athens News: As the UN Security Council's Greek investigation team is about to arrive here, the crisis of the Tsaldaris dictatorial government has deepened due to the resignation of six ministers. The direct reason for the resignation of the six cabinet members, led by Deputy Prime Minister and National Liberal Party leader General Zannas, was Tsaldaris's refusal to convene a Crown Council to resolve the long-standing cabinet crisis. The cabinet crisis originated from the intensification of Greek guerrilla activities and the refusal of "parliamentary opposition" leaders Venizelos and Sophoulis (both Liberal Party leaders) to cooperate with the government before the arrival of the international investigation team. Venizelos and Sophoulis are now both demanding the resignation of the Tsaldaris government. Venizelos believes that Tsaldaris should admit the failure of his previous policies and should not continue to implement policies that he himself does not believe in.

　　希腊内阁发生危机
    自由党六部长辞职
    【新华社延安十九日电】（迟到）雅典讯：当此安理会希腊调查团行将抵达此间之际，曹敦利斯独裁政府的危机已因六部长之辞职而加深。以副总理兼国民自由党领袖敦那塔斯将军为首的六阁员辞职的直接原因，是曹达利斯之拒绝召开御前会议，以求解决长时期以来即已存在的内阁危机。内阁危机起源于希游击队活动之加剧以及“国会反对派”领袖维尼齐洛斯，及索福利斯（俱系自由党领袖）在国际调查团到来之前，拒绝与政府合作。维索二氏现均要求曹达利斯政府辞职，维氏认为曹达利斯应承认他以前政策的失败，不应在继续执行他自己都不相信的政策。
