　　Welcoming New Tasks and New Victories
    People and Army Throughout the Region Joyfully Celebrate the New Year
    [This newspaper dispatch] On New Year's Day morning, the army and people throughout the border region, with hearts full of anticipation for brightness and victory, held group New Year's greetings everywhere. Mr. Hu Zhuxuan, the financial magnate of the border region and president of the privately-owned Ruihua Bank, rushed to a certain place on this day to exchange New Year's greetings with Vice Chairmen Yang Rong of the Border Region Government, Deputy Commander Teng of the Military Region, and Comrade Bo Yibo of the CPC Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau. Mr. Hu stated: Ruihua Bank has only been established for half a year, and has already earned a 100% net profit (the total amount of funds is 50 million yuan). This is entirely the result of the correct leadership of the CPC Central Bureau and the full support of the democratic government. Mr. Wang Yinggu, manager of the industrial capitalist Yongsheng Chemical Factory, and Mr. Han Xiuli, a giant in the commercial sector, both expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the support of the CPC and the democratic government, and expressed their willingness to continue to expand their businesses under the leadership of the CPC and the democratic government, and to strive for the large-scale production movement in the border region in 1947. On this day, 20 million liberated peasants expressed their love for the people's leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, in various ways. The masses of the entire village of Beizhang Village in Shahe County sent representatives to present two of the best fox fur coats from their struggle achievements to General Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, who tirelessly travel to the self-defense front. All the new soldiers of the Cixian County Peasants' Emancipation Corps, after only one month of training, automatically requested to go to the front lines. On New Year's Day, at the New Year's greeting meeting of more than 5,000 cadres and soldiers directly under the military region, they solemnly swore: "We are willing to dedicate ourselves to the patriotic self-defense war, advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong, resolutely fight until we wipe out the invading Chiang's troops, recover all lost territories, and thoroughly realize China's independence, democracy, and peace!" When they heard that our Ji-Lu-Yu front-line troops had recovered Liaocheng and Juye on New Year's Eve as a New Year's gift, the army and people throughout the region were even more confident, and spent this New Year's Day of 1947 in a warm and intense atmosphere.

    【本报讯】元旦清晨，全边区军民均以迎接光明与胜利的心情，到处举行团拜。边区金融巨子私立瑞华银行行长胡竹轩先生，是日赶赴某地，与边区政府杨戎正副主席、军区滕副司令员、中共晋冀鲁豫中央局薄一波同志等互相拜年。胡先生称：瑞华银行成立仅半年，已盈一倍纯利（资金总额为五万万元），此全系中共中央局正确领导及民主政府全力扶持的结果，工业资本家永生化学工厂经理王膺固先生，商业界巨子韩修礼先生等，对中共与民主政府的扶持均表示衷心的感谢，愿在中共及民主政府的领导下，继续扩大业务，为边区一九四七年开展大生产运动而奋斗。是日，两千万翻身农民，更以各种各样的形式，来表示他们对人民领袖毛泽东同志的热爱。沙河县北掌村全村群众并派代表把斗争果实中两件最好的狐皮袄，送给不辞劳苦奔波于自卫前线上的刘伯承将军及邓小平政委。磁县农民翻身团全体新战士，只经一月的训练，即自动要求开赴前线。元旦日他们在军区直属队五千余干部战士的团拜会上，高声宣誓：“我们自愿献身给爱国自卫战争，在毛泽东的旗帜下胜利前进，坚决斗争，直到把进犯蒋军歼灭干净，收复一切失地，彻底实现中国的独立民主和平！”当听到我冀鲁豫前线部队，除夕之夜收复聊城、巨野作为新年献礼时，全区军民更是信心百倍，在热烈紧张中渡过此一九四七的元旦。
