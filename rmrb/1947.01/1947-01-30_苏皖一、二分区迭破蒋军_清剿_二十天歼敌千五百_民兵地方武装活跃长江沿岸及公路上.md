Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th: From January 20th to February 11th, over a period of 20 days, the local armed forces and militia of the Suwan Border Region's First Military Sub-district, in their counter-"encirclement and suppression" efforts, killed, wounded, or captured over 1,200 Chiang Kai-shek troops and "Homecoming Legions," seizing 6 light and heavy machine guns and 160 rifles. On February 2nd, the Taixing local armed forces launched a fierce attack on the Chiang Kai-shek stronghold in Huangqiao. After several minutes of fighting, they completely wiped out the Chiang Kai-shek security team led by Captain Yan, eliminating dozens of personnel. Taking advantage of their victory, they stormed the Jiangbiankouzhen port town, driving out the Chiang Kai-shek township government. During the same period, the Second Military Sub-district's local armed forces and militia launched extensive attacks in the border areas, eliminating and capturing over 340 Chiang Kai-shek troops and "Homecoming Legion" members, seizing one light and one heavy machine gun, over 100 long and short guns, reclaiming ten boats of grain and 83 donkeys that had been looted, and removing ten Chiang Kai-shek strongholds in the east of Xinghua, Pingwang, Taojiacun in Baoying, and Da Xiaoguanzhuang. The vast rural areas in the north of Baoying, Xinghua, and the two counties of Qintong and Gaoyou remain firmly in the hands of the people. The Qintong County Southward Advance Detachment and Advance Detachment have advanced south of the Qingting River, successively recovering Chiang Kai-shek's strongholds. Another unit of the local armed forces has crossed the Jie (Shou) Lin (Ze) Highway, which runs across the territory of Gaoyou County, and wedged itself into the rear of Chiang Kai-shek's army. After repeated setbacks in the "encirclement and suppression" campaigns in various places, Wang Maogong, the Chiang Kai-shek-appointed Chairman of Jiangsu Province, personally went to Dongtai at the beginning of the new year to convene the so-called "Administrative Conference for Newly Recovered Counties and Districts" to review the lessons of failure and reorganize the "encirclement and suppression" centered on Dongtai, planning to establish a "Local Pacification Office" in Dongtai city. Currently, the local army and people are widely preparing for another counter-"encirclement and suppression" campaign and have completely destroyed more than 70 bunkers that had forced the retreat of more than ten Chiang Kai-shek strongholds such as Sancang in the first counter-"encirclement and suppression" campaign.
