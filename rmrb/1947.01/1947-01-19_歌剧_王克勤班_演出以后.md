　　After the Performance of the Opera "Wang Keqin Class"
    Pei De

    The opera "Wang Keqin Class," jointly directed by the Military Region Cultural Troupe and a certain unit's cultural team, was performed in a certain unit on New Year's Eve, and was greatly welcomed and highly praised by the soldiers. The day after the performance, the unit immediately organized discussions in each company. Comrade Li Qingzhong of the Fourth Platoon, Fourth Squad said: "I am slow-witted and often get angry. Squad leader Yue Kaide has been constantly helping me, and now my emotions are much better. Our squad leader cares about us just like the squad leader in the play." Soldier Wang Jinbao of the Fourth Squad frankly admitted at the discussion: "I have always wanted to run away because I am not used to the life here. Although the superiors have repeatedly advised me, I was still hesitating. After watching 'Wang Keqin Class,' I was greatly moved and no longer have the thought of running away." Many new soldiers are determined to learn from Bai Zhixue and the others in the play and become combat models. Cadres at the squad and platoon level also use Wang Keqin to examine themselves. Yue Kaide, the squad leader of the Fourth Platoon, Fourth Squad, reviewed his work of the past three months, feeling that he was lazy, did not do enough in uniting and loving his comrades, and had a bad attitude towards people, and that he should learn from Wang Keqin. Wang Zhiren, the squad leader of the First Squad, said: "Since I came to the First Squad, I have not taken good enough care of everyone. The model squad leader in the play gave me a stimulus. In the future, I must take good care of my comrades."
    Now, everyone is intensifying training with the highest enthusiasm, improving combat skills, and the attitude towards work has also begun to change. The relationship between officers and soldiers is closer than before.

　　歌剧“王克勤班”演出以后
    培德
    军区文工团和某部文工队合作编导的“王克勤班”歌剧，除夕在某部演出，大受战士们的欢迎，并得到很高的评价。该部在演出后第二天，立即组织各连讨论。四连四班李清忠同志说：“我心笨，常发怒，班长岳开德同志不断的帮助我，现在我的情绪好多了。我们班长和戏里那个班长一样关心咱们。”四班战士王金报同志在讨论会上坦白承认：“我一向因为生活不惯，老想跑，虽然上级苦苦的劝告过我，但还是在犹豫。看了“王克勤班”以后，受到很大的感动，再也不想跑的心思了。”好些新战士都立志要学白志学剧中人的榜样，当个战斗模范。班排干部们也拿王克勤来检讨自己。四连四班长岳开德把三个月的工作作了检讨，觉得自己偷懒，团结友爱做得不够，对人态度不好，要向王克勤学习。一班长王治仁说：“我来到一班后，对大家照顾太差了，戏里演的模范班长给我一个刺激，以后我对同志们一定要好好关心。”
    现在，大家都以最高涨的情绪加紧练武，提高战斗技术，工作态度也开始转变，官兵关系比从前更加密切了。
