    【Report from this newspaper, JiluYu, 25th】After our army recaptured Juancheng, the masses have universally launched a counter-liquidation movement. Fan Guangdong, a bad landlord from Xinyi Village, Juancheng First District, after the Chiang army occupied Juancheng, his son Fan Yuzhen became a guerrilla for the Chiang army. He ate and drank lavishly every day, threatened the masses, and took all the public grain of the village and the grain of the village cadres and militia to his home, giving a small portion to the enemy. After Juancheng was recovered, he still spread rumors saying, "The Central Army will be here in a few days." After the masses reported to the democratic government, the government immediately arrested him, recovered 500 catties of public grain, 600 catties of farmers' association grain, six bags of Gao Liang belonging to Zhang Zhongzheng, and four chickens that he had taken. Finally, he was made to admit his mistakes at a mass meeting of the entire village. Xia Zhu'an, a local tyrant and landlord from Xiagai, took all the grain and furniture of farmer association member Wu Hai when the Chiang army occupied Juancheng. After Juancheng was recovered, he ran away, but was arrested in Fenghuangdian on the 25th. After the masses reasoned with him, they recovered two bags of grain, one large and one small pot, money, and chickens that he had robbed! Li Jinling, a 65-year-old hired laborer from Xifu Village, Juancheng Tenth District, has no one else in his family and no land. He worked for the landlord Li Chaojian in Dong Village. After the Chiang army occupied Juancheng, Li Jinling developed sores all over his body and could not move. He asked the landlord for wages to treat his illness, but the landlord not only refused to give it to him, but said, "You owe me 500 catties of grain. It's not like before when you could struggle against whoever you wanted. I won't feed lazy people." After Juancheng was recovered, Li Jinling's illness was still not cured, but he still gritted his teeth to fetch water for the landlord. The masses of the whole village were very indignant. Recently, a mass meeting of the entire village was held to struggle against Li Chaojian, and he was forced to pay all the wages, and the landlord was held responsible for the medical expenses.
    【Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 25th】After Quwo Qucun and Mengcheng were liberated, the local masses launched a new movement to pour out grievances and seek revenge. After the Qu Duan railway line was occupied by the Chiang army in September last year, the masses in Qucun and other places suffered all kinds of extortion and persecution by the enemy and puppets. In particular, those forcibly incorporated into villages by the puppets were subjected to conscription and grain extortion, stripping them bare. Zhang Diankui, a member of the Yan-organized village assistance committee, arrested people whenever he saw them and demanded money whenever he could. Even the wealthy were bankrupted by buying substitutes for conscription. Many mass cadres and militiamen were killed. After Qucun and Mengcheng were liberated by our army, the masses in the surrounding villages automatically captured Zhang Diankui and others, members of the puppet village assistance committee, setting off a new high tide of pouring out grievances and seeking revenge.

    鄄城收复后开展反倒算
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】我军收复鄄城后，群众已普遍展开反倒算运动。鄄城一区信义集坏蛋地主范广东，在蒋军占鄄城后。他儿范玉振当了蒋军的游击队，天天大吃大喝，威胁群众，并把村的公粮及村干部、民兵的粮食，全弄到他家，一小部分给敌人。鄄城收复后，他仍造谣说：“中央军几天就来”。群众向民主政府报告后，政府即加以逮捕，并追出他弄走的公粮五百斤，农会粮食六百斤，及张中正的高粱六布袋，小鸡四只。最后又让他在全村群众大会上，向大家承认错误。夏垓的恶霸地主夏株安，在蒋军占鄄城时，把农会员伍海的粮食家俱全部拿走。鄄城收复后，他跑了，廿五日在凤凰店把他逮捕，群众向他讲理后，追回他抢走的粮食！二布袋，大小锅各一口，及钱和鸡等。鄄城十区西富村雇工李金灵六十五岁，家里没有别人，也没地，给东村地主李朝鉴扛活，蒋军占鄄城后，李金灵长了一身疮，不能动，给地主要工资治病，地主不但不给，倒说：“你赔我五百斤粮食，不像从前你们想斗争谁就斗争谁，没有闲饭养活闲人”。鄄城收复后，李金灵的病还不好，但仍咬着牙给地主打水，全村群众都很愤慨，最近即开了一个全村群众大会，斗争了李朝鉴，并要出了全部工资，医药费由地主负责。
    【本报太岳二十五日电】曲沃曲村、蒙城光复后，当地群众展开了新的诉苦复仇运动。曲段铁路沿线去年九月被蒋军侵占后，曲村等地群众即遭敌伪百般勒索与残害，尤其被伪编村的抓丁勒索粮食，割的皮干肉净，阎编村协助委员张殿奎，见人就抓，见钱就要，富有者亦因买丁而倾家产。群众干部民兵被杀甚多。曲村、蒙城被我军解放后，周围数村群众自动捉拿编村伪协助委员张殿奎等，掀起新的诉苦复仇运动高潮。
