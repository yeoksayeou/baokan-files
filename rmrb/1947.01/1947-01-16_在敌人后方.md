　　Behind Enemy Lines
    Zhao Beidou
    The Kuomintang's 40th Army in Anyang and the reactionary landlords' Home Return Corps once boasted: "We have driven the Eighth Route Army to Shanxi, blocked the Kulong Mountain, and they will never come back again!..." But when the Anyang people's guerrillas became active, the Home Return Corps had to shrink back into their tortoise shells, and the 40th Army had to close the Shuizhaimen tightly. The people of Anyang no longer believed their nonsense.
    (1) Street Meeting
    When Comrade Liu Yaoting of our ×× team arrived at Jiadian, ××× said: "We are really bored to death, we wanted to call a meeting a long time ago!" When we told the villagers about our conditions for definitely defeating the Kuomintang army and their certain defeat, a young man jumped up from the corner and shouted: "Let's fight him!" But he was hurriedly pressed down by ××× beside him who said: "Keep quiet, where are we, we just need to have the will!"
    (2) Jumping-the-Wall Visit
    Our Third District ××× Assault Team, advanced into the enemy's heart, Lunzhang Village, at night. Two people used a rope ladder to jump into the home of landlord ×××. The landlord ×× said: "The fruits of the struggle are something that people will force you to give, otherwise they will say we are collaborating with the Eighth Route Army. Let me keep them for you temporarily!" Our Comrade ×× advised him to do more good deeds for the people and make more contributions, and there will be benefits in the future. The landlord ×× said: "I can't do anything that goes against my conscience. I've seen through them (the Home Return Corps) for a long time! They can't succeed!"
    On × day night, Liu Bingzi and others from the ×× team in our Sixth District were active in Xucun, and faintly heard voices, so they jumped over the wall into the courtyard and saw five or six people in the house. They had just returned from working with the enemy in Shuizhaimen and were resting at ×'s house. They said: "I knew you were coming when I heard the noise, they (referring to the enemy) don't dare to come out at night." After Comrade Liu Bingzi told them the news of the victory in Hua County, they said: "A eunuch's bird can't last long!"
    (3) Drumming to Awaken Dreams
    Guo Laixian and others from the ×× team in our Sixth District went to the × village area in the quiet of the night. They took the gong that ××× often prepared for them, and as they walked, they beat it and shouted: "Villagers! Wake up!" And they reported the news of victory to the villagers who were awakened from their dreams: "Hua County has annihilated two and a half brigades of the enemy", warning those reactionary landlords' lackeys not to bully the masses. "Whoever bullies the masses will get immediate retribution!" And they urged the villagers to help our army lead the way, send information, and carry stretchers. The masses in villages such as ×× have become accustomed to it. Every time they hear the sound of a gong in the middle of the night, they listen intently to the new news.
    (4) Tapping on Windows
    He Wuzi and others from our ×× team sneaked into Fucheng and Jiangcun (where the Home Return Corps was stationed) for three days and nights, lightly tapped on the window lattice of ×'s house, waking up ×××, and reported the news of the victory in Hua County. Also in × village, they woke up the family member ××× of the puppet Bao chief, and instructed him to advise the puppet Bao chief not to bully the masses and to protect the families of the militiamen and soldiers. In the future, he can atone for his crimes. Otherwise, it would be "unfair to him!" On November 27th, Comrade ××× and others from our Third District went to ×××'s house in × village. When they knocked on the gong, ××× asked who it was, immediately opened the door to welcome them in for water and rest, and told them to be careful, and then sent them out safely.

　　在敌人后方
    赵北斗
    安阳蒋军四十军和反动地主的还乡团曾大吹大擂的说：“我们把八路军赶到山西去了，把窟窿山堵住，他们再也不会来了！……”但是当安阳人民的游击队活动起来时，还乡团只得缩回他的乌龟壳里去，四十军也只得把水冶城门紧闭，安阳人们再也不相信他们的鬼话了。
    （一）街头会议
    当我××队刘耀亭等到达贾店时，×××说：“我们实在闷得要死，早想叫咱开个会哩！”当我们向老乡们说出我们必胜蒋军必败的条件时，有个年轻的小伙子，从墙角边跳起大声说：“和他干！”却被跟前的×××急促的把他按下去说：“你悄悄吧，这是什么地方，咱有心就是了！”
    （二）跳墙访问
    我三区×××突击队，于夜间挺进到敌人的心脏伦掌村，两个人搭着软梯跳到地主×××的家里，地主××说：“斗争果实是人家非让要不行，不然说咱通八路，我给咱们暂时保存一下吧！”我××同志劝他给人民多办点好事，多立些功劳，将来自有好处的。地主××说：“咱不能办亏心事，我早就看出他们（还乡团）了！不能成事！”
    ×日夜，我六区××队刘炳子等活动到许村，隐约听有说话声即越墙跳到院里，看见屋里有五六个人，他们刚从水冶与敌做工回来，在×家休息。他们说：“我听到响声就知道你们来了，他们（指敌人）黑夜是不敢出来的。”当刘炳子同志告以滑县胜利消息后，他们说：“太监的鸟，他长不了！”
    （三）打锣惊梦
    我六区的××队郭来贤等人在寂静的深夜，到×村一带，他们拿起×××经常给准备好的锣，一面走，一面敲，一面喊道：“老乡们！醒醒吧！”并向由睡梦中醒来的老乡们报告胜利消息：“滑县消灭了敌人两个半旅”，警告那些反动地主的走狗们，不要欺负群众，谁要欺负群众，给你个现时现报！”并劝勉老乡们帮助我军带路、送情报、抬担架。在××等村的群众已经习惯了，每于深夜一闻锣声，即倾耳静听新的消息。
    （四）弹窗
    我××队何五子等人，三日夜偷进阜城、蒋村（还乡团驻村），轻敲×家窗棂，惊醒×××，报告滑县胜利消息。又在×村，敲醒伪保长的本家×××，嘱咐他劝告伪保长，不要欺负群众，保护民兵家属和军属，将来可以将功折罪。不然，就“对不起他！”十一月二十七日，我三区×××同志等人到×村×××家，当敲锣时，×××问明是谁时，马上开开门接他们进去喝水，休息、并叮嘱他们可要稳当些，然后又好好的把他们送出来。
