(I) What should the government and army do during the movement to support the government and cherish the people?

Editor:

    The Lunar New Year is approaching, and various regions are carrying out work to support the government and cherish the people. I would like to offer some suggestions based on what I know from the military.

    In the past year, due to the influence of peaceful illusions, some disputes occurred between the military and the people, and between the military and the government. I believe that we should seriously study the causes in this movement, find the key, and seek solutions.

    Local Party and government comrades should study the actual living conditions and ideological realities of the troops. A small number of lower-level cadres in the army have a so-called "cherish the people but not support the government" mentality. The main reasons for this mentality are, first, the demand for care for military dependents, and second, a lack of understanding of the work of the government and government cadres.

    Therefore, in response to this situation, I feel that if local Party, government, and civilian work comrades can pay attention to the following work, it will give the frontline soldiers great encouragement and strength:

    If, in the ongoing land-to-the-tiller inspection movement, more attention is paid to the lives of poor military dependents, understanding whether they have truly received land, and mobilizing their families to write letters to the frontline soldiers, telling them what they have gained in their own homes, and village cadres in each village are also responsible for telling the frontline soldiers how their families have been taken care of in this movement. Furthermore, the masses should be universally educated to regularly help and respect military dependents. Past unresolved family issues should be resolved this time, and the results of the resolution should be told to the front lines.

    Secondly, in some counties and villages in the Taihang area, the ancestral halls and temples that were universally feudal in the past should be transformed into martyr's shrines. I remember when our troops passed through there, some soldiers said, "I don't know how things are in our village? We poor guys, to be able to enter the ancestral hall after we die, is something we never expected in our lives!" From this, it can be seen that the commemoration of martyrs can be mourned in their ancestral homes, ancestral tombs, which makes the soldiers feel more practical and intimate than centralized memorial tower-style buildings. If this style can be promoted throughout the entire border area, it will be a great encouragement and comfort to the frontline soldiers!

    So, what should the army do?

    First of all, education on the land policy should be emphasized in the troops, so that they understand the relationship between the land reform movement and their blood and bones. At the same time, the government's preferential treatment regulations for military dependents should be explained so that they can consider the standards of preferential treatment from a global perspective. Many dissatisfied opinions in the past often started from excessively high requirements.

    Secondly, education should be carried out among cadres to make them understand the complexity and hardship of local work, to eliminate the idea of "purely armed struggle", and to make everyone practically understand and estimate the importance of political and civilian work and the position occupied by the strength of the masses in the victorious war of self-defense.

    The above opinions may not be correct, and are submitted for reference in various places.

(II) Please don't be too wasteful when treating guests

Editor:

    I recently received a letter from Comrade × working in Changzhi City, saying: "You are very frugal at home during the New Year. I heard that the agencies here are also very thrifty during the New Year, which is very good, but there is a very bad phenomenon, that is, the custom of treating guests is very prevalent, especially in stores. From the Lunar New Year to now (the 15th), it has lasted for half a month. Some people haven't even eaten at home for half a month. Each time they treat guests, there are at least three tables, and there must be seaweed on the table. The value of each table is between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan, which adds up to about one million yuan, which is shocking. This is indeed a great waste." The old year is coming again, and we must practice thrift. This kind of wasteful phenomenon must never happen again.

                Reader Xiushan

(Comrade Xiushan's situation is also mentioned in a similar letter from Changzhi reader Jia Yuankui. We believe that treating guests during the Lunar New Year is a past custom of merchants and is not absolutely forbidden, but local working cadres should patiently persuade people not to be extravagant and wasteful. It is very important to practice thrift. Zhang Yongtai, a landlord in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, used to eat a whole pig during the New Year every year, but this year he only ate half a pig. We should use these examples to educate the masses. —Editor)

(III) Please hold a traveling exhibition of self-defense war achievements

Editor:

    Last time I went to Yetao to comfort the troops, I enjoyed a good look at the war achievements exhibition at the group celebration meeting. To see photos such as "Liu Guangxin sent nine American howitzers," "Endless groups of prisoners," and "A certain hero threw double bombs with one hand," I was so crowded that I was sweating. On the side of the magnificent howitzer, it was noted "...Chiang Kai-shek has a total of thirty-nine of these American cannons. In the victory of Juanan, nine of them were transferred to the Liberation Army..." (the general idea is like this), which gave me a deeper understanding of the glorious achievements of our self-defense war.

    I would like to suggest that during the Lunar New Year, comrades from the military region's cultural troupe should plan to select a few larger towns (such as Handan, Xingtai, Changzhi, Yangyi, Shexian, etc.) or certain villages, accompanied by local mass Lunar New Year entertainment activities, to conduct a "traveling exhibition of self-defense war achievements" (border area construction and other aspects can also be included). Because "traveling exhibitions" are a very effective method of publicity and education that can enhance the confidence of the masses in the liberated areas with vivid facts, seize the opportunity of the Spring Festival and do a good job.

### 大家谈年关中作些什么？

专栏：读者服务

    大家谈年关中作些什么？
    （一）拥政爱民运动中政府和军队应作些什么？编辑同志：
    旧历年关到了，各地正在进行拥爱工作，愿就我在部队中所了解的，提出一点建议。
    在过去一年中，由于和平幻想的影响，发生过某些军民军政关系间的纠纷，我认为应当在这一运动中，认真研究原因，找出关键，求得解决。
    地方党政同志应当研究部队的生活实际和思想实际，部队中一少部分下层干部中，存在着的所谓“爱民不拥政”的思想，这一种思想产生的主要原因，一是要求对军属的照顾。一是对政权工作与政权干部的不够了解。
    因之，针对这一情况，我感觉到如果地方党政民工作同志，能够注意下述一些工作，将会对前方战士给以莫大的鼓舞和力量：
    如果在正在进行的耕者有其田的检查运动中。多注意到一些贫苦军属的生活，了解他们是否真正得到了土地，并发动他们的家属普遍的向前方战士写信，告诉他们自家得到了什么，各村的村干部同样负责的告诉前线战士，在这一运动中，如何照顾了他们的家属。并且还应普遍的教育群众，经常帮助与尊重军属，过去一些家属问题遗留未决的，应设法在这一次求得解决，并将其解决的结果告诉前方。
    其次，在太行区的某些县份的乡村中，普遍的将村里过去封建的宗祠庙宇，改造成为烈士祠，记得我们的部队从那里经过时，有的战士说：“不知道咱们村里怎么样？咱们这些穷家伙，死了能进祠堂，真是那辈子也没想到！”从此可见，对于烈士的纪念，能在他们的一宗一社，祖宗坟墓的家乡里得到悼念，较之集中性的纪念塔式的建筑，战士们更感到实际亲切。如果能将这一作风，在全边区推行起来，将是前方战士极大的鼓励与安慰！
    那末在军队方面应怎样呢？
    首先应在部队中着重进行土地政策的教育，使他们了解：土地改革运动与他们的血骨关系，同时解释政府的军属优待条例，使他们能够从全局去考虑优待的标准的规定，过去有许多不满意的意见，往往是从过高的要求标准出发的。
    其次，是在干部中进行教育，使他们了解地方工作的复杂艰苦，去掉“单纯武装斗争”的想法，使大家实际的去了解与估计在胜利的自卫战争中政民工作的重要与群众力量所占的位置。
    上述意见，不一定对，谨提出供各地参考。

   （二）请客不要太浪费编辑同志：
    近接在长治市工作的×同志来信说：“你们在家过年，听说很节约，这里的机关过年亦很俭朴，颇带节约精神，这是很好的，可是有一点很不好的现象，即请客之风很盛，这种现象，特别表现在商店中。从年关到现在（十五日）连绵半月之久，甚至有的人，半月来都没在家中吃饭，每次请客，起码三席，而且席上必有海菜，每席价值总在一万到两万之间，整个计算下来，总值在百万元左右，闻之惊人，这实在是一个大的浪费。”旧年又到，我们要厉行节约，此种浪费现象，千万勿再发生。
                读者  秀山
    （秀山同志谈的这种情况，长治读者贾元魁同志也有同样的来信，我们觉得年关请客是商人过去的习惯，不是绝对不可，但当地工作干部应耐心说服，不要铺张浪费，厉行节约，是非常重要的。陕甘宁边区地主张永泰，常年过年吃一口猪，今年只吃半口猪，应该拿这些例子去教育群众。——编者）
    （三）请举办自卫战绩巡回展览编辑同志：
    上次我去冶陶劳军，在团拜会场上饱看了一顿战绩展览，为了看“刘广信送来九门美式榴弹炮”、“无边的俘虏集团”和“某英雄一手投双弹”等照片，挤得我身上冒汗。在那雄伟的榴弹炮侧面，注明“……这种美式炮，蒋介石一共三十九门，鄄南之捷，即有九门转入解放军之手………”（大意如此）使我对我们自卫战争的辉煌战绩，有了更深切的了解。
    我谨建议：在旧历年关中，大军区文工团同志，应有计划地挑几个较大的城镇（如邯郸、邢台、长治、阳邑、涉县等）或一定村庄，配以当地群众年关娱乐的活动，进行一次“自卫战绩巡回展览”（边区建设及其他方面的东西也可列入）。因为“巡回展览”是一种能以活生生事实增强解放区群众胜利信心的很有效的宣传教育方法之一，要抓紧春节这机会，好好干一番。
