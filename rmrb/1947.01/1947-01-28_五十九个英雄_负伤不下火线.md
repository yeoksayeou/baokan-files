Fifty-Nine Heroes
Wounded but Not Leaving the Front Line

   During the Shao Erzhai annihilation battle, on the southwest corner's main assault position, there were fifty-nine wounded fighters. Encouraged by the heroic fighting of their comrades, they refused to leave the front line. A strong belief in victory and heroic spirit supported them in continuing their tenacious struggle against Chiang's troops.

   Deputy Regiment Commander Zhao was wounded early in the morning, but he continued to fight alongside the Third Battalion only a dozen meters away from the enemy. He nonchalantly waved his injured hand, helping the soldiers dig fortifications. In the morning, when the enemy attempted to break through, he jumped out of the fortifications and personally led the soldiers in throwing grenades, preparing for bayonet charges, and repelling the enemy's fierce attacks. Company Commander Hu Chengqun's previous wound had not yet healed, and he was wounded again this time, but he continued to direct the battle as usual, persisting until dark. Second Platoon Leader Wang Xiaosan was wounded in the left eye, but he still led the assault team in charging forward. Instructor Li Rensheng and his messenger were wounded twice simultaneously, and one of his legs was broken, but they still shouted angrily, "Everyone must avenge us!" Five members of the Third Battalion Headquarters' communications squad were wounded, but they still ran back and forth through the rain of bullets as if they were healthy. The young messenger, Li Jufu, was seriously wounded in the leg, and he rolled and crawled to deliver the letter. After reporting the completion of his mission, he told his superiors, "My leg has been hit." The new recruit Yuan Qinghuai's arm was broken, but he still calmly told others to take cover, while he observed the enemy. Machine Gun Squad Leader Guo Lianzhu and his light machine gun were both hit. Ignoring the blood still flowing from his wound, he put down the broken machine gun, picked up a rifle, took three grenades, and followed the troops in the charge. Soldiers Xu Tongsheng, Zhao Hezhong, Liu Shirong, Mao Qingyu, Fu Erxiao, Yang Mozi, Lü Xingyuan and other comrades were all wounded, but they were still charging into battle.

   The enemy was completely annihilated by us. Before dawn, the troops returned to their original positions to assemble. Nineteen wounded comrades from the Third Battalion were guarding the backpacks on the battlefield. They happily discussed the battle stories of the past two nights and one day. As we approached, they mistook us for stragglers from the enemy's breakout attempt and all picked up rifles and grenades, ordering us to surrender. After clarifying the passwords, it turned out we were on the same side, and everyone couldn't help but burst into laughter, creating an amusing scene.

    五十九个英雄
    负伤不下火线
    邵耳寨歼灭战中西南角的主攻阵地上，有五十九位负伤者，他们为战友们的英勇奋战所鼓舞而不下火线，坚强的胜利信心和英雄气概支持着他们，继续和蒋军作顽强的斗争。
    赵副团长在清早就负了伤，但他仍然在距敌十几米远的地方和三营一起作战，他并不在意的挥动着负伤的手，帮助战士挖工事，上午敌人企图突围，他就跳出工事，亲率战士们打炸弹，准备拚刺刀，打退了敌人的猛扑。胡成群连长前次的伤口还未痊愈，这次又挂了彩，但他还照常的指挥作战，坚持到天黑。二排长王小三左眼打伤了，但他依然带领突击队冲上去。指导员李任胜和他的通讯员同时负了两次伤，一条腿被打折了，但他们还愤恨的高喊：“大家要替我们报仇啊！”三营营部通讯班五个人负了伤，可是他们还和健康人一样的在弹雨中跑来跑去。小通讯员李聚福腿上负了重伤，他就边滚边爬的把信送到，回来报告了任务后，才对首长说：“我的腿上挂彩了。”新战士袁庆怀的胳膊打断了，他仍谈笑自如的叫别人隐蔽，由他来观察敌人。机枪班长郭连珠和他的歪把机枪一起挂了彩，他竟不顾伤口还在流血，放下坏机枪，拿起一条步枪，带了三颗炸弹，跟着部队一起冲锋。战士许通生、赵和中、刘世荣、毛庆玉、傅二小、杨漠子、吕杏元等同志都负了伤，都还在冲锋陷阵。
    敌人全部被我们歼灭了，天还不明，部队回到原阵地上集合，三营有十九个彩号在战场上看守背包，他们高兴地谈论这两夜一天的战斗故事，我们走近了，他们还把我们当做突围的敌人散兵，一齐拿起步枪手榴弹，来叫我们缴枪，待双方问明了口令，原来是自己人，大家不禁失声大笑，闹了一场有趣的喜剧。
