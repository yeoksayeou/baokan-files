[Reported by our newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 26th] After a certain district in Guancheng implemented land reform amidst the flames of war, when Chiang's troops invaded, the liberated militiamen and masses were determined to defend the land they had obtained and launched a guerrilla war against the enemy. The district carried out war preparations during the land reform, and the district cadres expressed their willingness to share life and death with the militia. When Chiang's troops invaded the district, the militia formed guerrilla groups based on small villages. The militia were highly motivated, contacting and scouting everywhere day and night, and deploying for battle. On December 26th, they repelled Chiang's troops in Yanzhuang. On the 31st, Chiang's troops set out from Caochang to invade eastward, but were met with a volley of gunfire from our militia at Chechuankou, deterring the enemy from advancing. On the 1st of this month, when Chiang's troops invaded Dengzhuang from Louji, they came into contact with a certain unit of our army. Militia member Yue Ximing single-handedly fired from the enemy's flank, causing the enemy to believe they were surrounded by our main force, and they retreated in panic. The militia also captured two enemy scouts alive. When the enemy advanced to Wuzhuang, Chiang's troops and our army fought for a cypress forest. Just as it seemed that Chiang's troops would seize it, militia member Guo Xucai rushed up and repelled the enemy, allowing our army to occupy the cypress forest. One day, when Chiang's troops invaded Da Li Lou, the militia immediately met them at the village entrance, providing cover for the safe evacuation of women, children, and the elderly in the village. The militia in the district have won successive victories, protecting the interests of the masses and boosting their morale.

    观城民兵游击小组
    屡次击溃进犯蒋军
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】观城某区自在炮火中实行土地改革后，在蒋军进犯时，翻身的民兵与群众决心保卫已得到的土地，对敌展开游击战。该区在土地改革中即进行备战工作，区干部并表示与民兵同生死。蒋军向该区进犯时，民兵即以小区为单位成立游击小组。民兵作战情绪很高，白天黑夜到处联络侦察，布置战斗。十二月廿六日在阎庄击退蒋军。三十一日蒋军从草场出发东犯，被我民兵在车川口打了一排枪，使敌人不敢前进。本月一日蒋军从楼集向邓庄进犯时，与我军某部接触，民兵岳喜明一人从敌人侧面射击，敌人以为被我主力包围了，仓皇退回，民兵并活捉敌探二名。敌人进至武庄时，蒋军与我军争夺一柏树林，眼看就叫蒋军抢去，民兵郭续才赶快冲上去击退敌人，我军即占领柏树林。某日蒋军向大李楼进犯，民兵即在村头迎击，掩护村里妇女老幼安全转移。该区民兵接连获胜，保卫了群众利益，鼓舞了群众情绪。
