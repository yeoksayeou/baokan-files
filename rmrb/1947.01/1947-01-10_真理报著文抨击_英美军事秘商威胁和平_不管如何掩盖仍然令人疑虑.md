【TASS, Moscow, 6th】 *Pravda* published an article stating: Foreign newspapers have recently been continuously reporting on Anglo-American military cooperation. According to some reports, this cooperation has now transformed into a formal military alliance, or is trending towards such a transformation. The French newspaper *L'Aurore* reported to its readers that a secret military, political, and economic agreement between the British and American governments may be signed on March 15, 1947. Foreign observers cannot help but notice the definite connection between the following facts: the agreement on the standardization of Anglo-American armaments, the decision to extend the authority of the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States, and the recently announced agreement to continue Anglo-American air force "wartime" cooperation. Foreign newspapers have already expressed a certain degree of astonishment at these facts. The United Nations organization has been called upon to be an effective tool for maintaining peace and security; there is no direct danger of a new war. As has been proven at the recent first "General Assembly" meeting, the representatives of the vast majority of countries in the world support the Soviet delegation's proposal for general disarmament. Under these circumstances, any act intended to conclude new military alliances or agreements, even if secret, and concluded outside the existing international peacekeeping institutions, cannot but arouse reasonable surprise. The recent announcement by the United States that the war period ended on December 31, 1946, followed on the same day by the republication of a long-term plan to continue Anglo-American air force "wartime" cooperation, is particularly noteworthy for the contradiction it reveals. Although British and American officials have repeatedly attempted to dilute the significance of their military collaboration, and even attempted to deny that the military authorities of the two countries have concluded an agreement on the standardization of armaments, they have ultimately failed to convince. In any case, shortly after this "denial," it became clear that the "denial" had no refuting effect whatsoever. The facts remain the facts. It is noteworthy that the British right-wing newspaper *Daily Mail* has now taken upon itself the task of defending the agreement on the standardization of Anglo-American armaments, even calling this agreement the "first step towards creating a United Nations armed force." It should be pointed out that the *Daily Mail* completely incorrectly equates the formation of a military "bloc" of two powers with the primary task of the United Nations in maintaining international peace. Due to its ineffective defense, the *Daily Mail* not only fails to dispel world fears, but also increases them. These fears are caused by the behind-the-scenes military and political activities in London and Washington.

    英美军事秘商威胁和平
    不管如何掩盖仍然令人疑虑
    【塔斯社莫斯科六日电】真理报著文称：外国报纸近来连续登载有关英美军事合作之报导。据某些消息透露，此种合作刻已转变为正式之军事同盟，或有向此转变之趋势。法国《震旦》报曾向读者报导称：英美政府间秘密之军事、政治、经济协定，可能于一九四七年三月十五日签订。外国观察家不能不注意存在于下列事实间之确凿联系：英美军备标准化之协定，在美国的英美联合参谋部职权延长之决议，及最近公布继续英美空军“战时”合作之协定。对于此等事实，外国报纸刻已表示出某种程度之惊异。联合国机构，已被要求为维持和平与安全之有效工具，新战争之直接危险并未存在。如在最近第一次“联大”会议中业已证明：世界上绝大多数国家之代表，均赞成苏联代表团普遍裁减军备之提议。在此情形下，任何意在缔结新军事同盟或协定之行为，即使是秘而不宣，而且在现在维持国际和平机构之外缔结，并不能不引起合理之惊奇。最近美国宣布一九四六年十二月三十一日战争时期业已结束，而同日复发表继续英美空军“战时”合作之长期计划，此两者所表现之矛盾，更特别值得注意。英美官方虽重复地企图冲淡双方军事联合行为之意义，甚至企图否认英美双方军事当局缔结关于军备标准化之协定，然而究竟不能使人信服。无论如何，在此一次“否认”后不久，即显露出“否认”并未起任何驳倒之作用。事实仍是事实，值得注意者，英国右翼报纸为《每日邮报》刻已以维护英美军备标准化之协定作为其任务，甚而称此协定为“达到创造联合国武装之首要步骤”。应当指出：《每日邮报》完全错误地将二强军事“集团”之形成，与联合国维持国际和平之首要工作同等看待。由于无成效之辩护，《每日邮报》不但不能消除世界疑惧，反而使之增加起来，而这些疑惧，系由伦敦及华盛顿幕后之军事、政治活动所引起的。
