　　Adapting to the Demands of Liberated Masses
    The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Literary Association Reforms New Year Pictures
    [Report from this newspaper] As the Lunar New Year approaches, the supply department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Literary Association, in conjunction with folk artists, is reforming the content of the Kitchen God, Door Gods, paper offerings, and New Year pictures needed for the festival, in order to eliminate feudal and superstitious ideas among the masses. Recently, the supply department, together with the cultural and educational bureaus and industrial and commercial administration bureaus of Chaocheng, Zhangqiu, and other counties, folk artists, local cultural figures, calligraphy and painting artists, owners of paper offering shops, and workers, held several symposiums. They unanimously agreed that every Lunar New Year, the "Kitchen God" and "New Year pictures" alone consume tens of millions of yuan, and their only effect is to deepen the people's feudal superstition. If they are not reformed, they will be opposed by the broad masses of awakened people, reduce sales, and cause workers in this industry to lose their jobs. In order to transform New Year pictures into New Year pictures that serve politics, it was proposed to reform their old content, and the public sector would help solve the financial and technical difficulties of the reform. As a result, all the paper offering shops are vying for the supply department to help design and reform, and the supply department has formed several technical teams to provide assistance on a tour. The reformed New Year pictures have fresh content and exquisite printing, and are very popular with the masses. According to the owners of the paper offering shops, it is estimated that this year, 300,000 to 500,000 new "Kitchen Gods" will go to various families.
    [Report from this newspaper, Weixian, 15th] The Propaganda Department of the Fifth Prefectural Committee of Southern Hebei issued a notice on Lunar New Year cultural and recreational activities, stating: This year is the first New Year after the masses achieved great liberation. This year's cultural and recreational activities must meet the new demands of the masses and provide ideological and political improvement and education. At the same time, we must never add any burden to the people due to New Year entertainment, nor should the time be too long, so as not to hinder production and war preparations. First, we must adhere to the principle of the masses writing, singing, and enjoying themselves. Old dramas that promote feudal ideas are not allowed to be performed. We must greatly promote and reward new content such as the mass liberation movement, joining the army, giving preferential treatment to soldiers and their families, uniting for production, and opposing the traitorous civil war. Secondly, scriptwriting and rehearsals should be combined with winter studies as much as possible. Women's participation in cultural and recreational activities should strictly adhere to the principle of voluntariness. It is strictly forbidden to purchase costumes and props and for actors to eat together collectively. No burden should be added to the people due to New Year cultural and recreational activities.

　　适应翻身群众要求
    冀鲁豫文联改造年画
    【本报讯】旧历年关将届，冀鲁豫边区文联供应部结合民间艺人，改造年节所需之灶王门神码子及年画的内容，以消除群众中的封建迷信思想。最近供应部协同朝城张秋等县文教科、工商管理局、民间艺人，地方文化人、画写家、码子店主人、工人等，经过数次座谈，一致认为每年年关“灶王爷”“年画”等即需消耗数千万元，而所起作用，只是加深人民的封建迷信。如不改造即会遭到广大觉悟群众的反对，减少销路，使此业工人失业。为了使年画变成为政治服务的年画，特提出改造其旧内容，由公家帮助解决财政与技术改造上的困难。于是各码子店都争先要求供应部帮助设计改造，供应部则组成几个技术小组巡回帮助。改造后所印出之年画，内容新鲜，印刷精良，颇为群众欢迎。据码子店主人估计：今年将有三十万至五十万新的“灶王爷”到各个家庭去。
    【本报威县十五日电】冀南五地委宣传部发出关于旧历年文娱活动的通知内称：今年是群众大翻身后第一个新年，今年的文化娱乐，必须适合群众新的要求，并给以思想政治的提高和教育，同时绝不要因年关娱乐，再加给人民一些负担，时间上也不要弄的过长，以免妨碍生产备战。首先要坚持群众自编自唱自乐的原则，不准演宣传封建思想的旧剧，大大提倡与奖励以群众翻身运动、参军、优抗、团结生产、反对卖国内战等新内容。其次编剧排演尽量与冬学结合，妇女参加文娱活动，要严格采取自愿原则，严格禁止置办行头衣物与演员集体吃饭，不许因年间文娱活动增加人民一点负担。
