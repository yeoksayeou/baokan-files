　　Beware of Enemy Sneak Attacks During the New Year
    Military Region Calls on Soldiers and Civilians to Avoid Complacency
    [Reported by this newspaper] As the Lunar New Year approaches, soldiers and civilians throughout the region are jubilantly celebrating the glorious victory of our army's self-defense operations over the past half-month. In order to raise the vigilance of our soldiers and civilians and prevent the enemy from taking advantage of the New Year to launch sneak attacks, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has issued a call to all counties along the border, urging them to avoid complacency and arrogance, and to properly combine celebrating the New Year with war preparedness, and to be ready at any time to launch a forceful counterattack against sneak attacks by the Chiang Kai-shek troops.
