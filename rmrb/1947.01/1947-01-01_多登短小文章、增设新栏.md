　　More Short Articles, New Columns
    Liu Zheng-yi
    Many comrades, including myself and those I have met, generally cannot read newspapers thoroughly and meticulously, especially lengthy and verbose articles. Apart from important commentaries or editorials, we rarely read them. However, we do read all the short articles in your newspaper's supplement. I particularly agree with the short article "Shorter, Even Shorter" reprinted from the *Liberation Daily*.

    Any article that is interesting is bound to be helpful to me. For example, the little poem "Eat the Pawn, Then Eat the Chariot" on December 10th is certainly an interesting piece, but I also find it helpful—it increases my confidence in victory and further clarifies Chiang Kai-shek's unkindness and lack of wisdom!

    I hope to see book and newspaper reviews, biographies (referring to writing about celebrities, combat, production, model workers, liberated heroes, and also villains), introductions to scenery in the liberated areas (mainly to increase readers' love for the liberated areas), school scenery, market corners, theater activities, work recommendations, writing research, etc., in this supplement. In short, the more concise and specific, the better, capable of seeing the big picture from the small.

    Lengthy novels, long poems, treatises, etc., even if they are by famous authors, can be sent to large magazines for publication. Leave the newspaper space to the broad masses of the people. (Of course, university professors, writers, and students are also the people, but those who put on airs and write thousands of words should be treated differently).

　　多登短小文章、增设新栏
    刘正一
    我和我所见到的好多同志，对报纸一般是不能彻头彻尾的细心阅读的，特别是长篇大论的东西，除了重要的专论或社论，很少看。对贵报副刊则短文都看。记得有一篇转载解放报的短文“短些，再短些”那个文章我最同意。
    凡是有趣味的文章一定也是于我有帮助的，比如十二月十号这篇“吃了卒子再吃车”的小诗吧，当然属于有趣味的作品，可是我觉得也有帮助，——增加我的胜利信心，更加使我明确蒋介石的不仁不智！
    书报评介，人物志（指写名人，战斗、生产、模范工作者，翻身英雄等以及反派人物），解放区风景介绍（主要使读者对解放区增加热爱），学校风光，市场一角，戏团活动，作品荐举，写作研究等，我都希望在这副刊里见到。总之，越简短、具体，能以小见大，就越好。
    长篇大论的小说、长诗、论著等，那怕他是名家的也可以送到大本杂志上去登载。把报纸篇幅交给广大的老百姓。（当然，大学教授、作家、学生也都是老百姓，但摆起架子，下笔千言者，则当别论）。
