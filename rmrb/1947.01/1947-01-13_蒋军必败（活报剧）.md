　　Chiang's Army is Bound to Fail (Living Newspaper)
　　Bianfu Club Collective Creation Zhou Fang, writer
    This living newspaper was performed by the Bianfu Club during the New Year and was very popular among the masses. Villagers in a certain village requested a second performance. A merchant in a certain town said, "Old Chiang is just like this, he's finished." Children who watched it once imitated and said, "I, surnamed Chiang, have never loved the word 'peace'." As the anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference approaches and the Spring Festival is coming, we are introducing it for use in various places. However, the living newspaper is not fixed, and new content can be added as appropriate during the performance.

　　First Act: Determination to Betray the Country and Fight a Civil War
    (Center stage has a screen, the middle door is closed, with the three characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity" pasted on it, the character "Shame" is dropped on the ground. To the left and right of the screen are signs, the left reads "Chairman's Residence," the right reads "People are Distant". After the gong and drum sound, a car sound is made, and Soong Tzu-wen enters from the upper right, wearing a sash that reads "President of the Executive Yuan", in a Western suit.)
    Soong: (Quick rhythmic speech) Born and raised in America, my sister married Old Chiang. If anyone asks who I am? Soong Tzu-wen is my name, or rather the President of the Executive Yuan. (White) I am Soong Tzu-wen. Now the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce is about to be signed. (Takes out the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce to read) This clause is good, this clause is just right. I have already ordered a large batch of American goods. Let me ask if they have arrived yet. Once my American goods arrive, I will order the "foreign exchange" to rise, making American dollars more valuable than legal tender, so I can earn even more, haha. Call and ask. (Soong walks to the right and makes a phone call) Hello! Jinshan Trading Company... I am your boss Soong Tzu-wen... Have our American goods arrived yet... Coming soon... Good... In the name of the National Government, issue an order... Increase foreign exchange... Raise the price, raise the price... Did you hear that? Keep it a secret these days. (Chiang Kai-shek, in military uniform with a command knife, enters from the left.)
    Chiang: I'm really worried to death.
    Soong: What are you worried about? Brother-in-law.
    Chiang: I'm worried about that one person.
    Soong: Which one are you worried about again? You just got involved with the Chen family's daughter, eighteen years old, and you've already set your sights on another one?
    Chiang: You're mistaken, I'm worried about that Mao in Yan'an. Now in this world, there are Communists everywhere. The Liberated Areas occupy half the sky, and the people are rising up to demand democracy. If this continues, will I, Chiang, still have a place in the world? The two million US dollars of wealth of our four families, Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen, will also be finished! We must quickly think of a way.
    Soong: There's no need to worry about this, I'm here to report good news to you. (Points to the "Sino-American Treaty of Commerce" in his pocket.)
    Chiang: What good news?
    Soong: Don't rush, let's first invite Old Kong and Old Chen to come and discuss it together.
    Chiang: Right, let's first hold a meeting of the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen! (Chiang calls "Lifu" to the right, and Soong calls "Old Kong" to the left. Chen Lifu and Kong Xiangxi enter, Chen dressed as a gangster, with "Secret Service Boss" written on his body, Kong in a long gown and mandarin jacket, with a big belly.)
    Chen: It's bad, it's bad.
    Chiang: What's the matter, why are you so flustered?
    Chen: Listen, the people are demanding democracy and opposing dictatorship. The students in Kunming were making trouble, and I suppressed them. A rally was held in Chongqing's Jiaochangkou, and I suppressed it too. Now the peace representatives from Shanghai have arrived at Xiaguan Station.
    (The entire audience shouts slogans, led by one person: "Demand democracy, oppose dictatorship; demand peace, oppose civil war; demand independence, oppose betrayal of the country.")
    Chiang (angrily towards the audience, drawing his command knife): What, are you rebelling? You want democracy! Humph! You are not qualified enough, you don't know how to exercise civil rights, you still need training, you are not worthy! (The other three say in unison: "Right, what the Chairman said is right.")
    Kong: My situation is even worse! There are big problems in finance and economy. So many civil servants need salaries, so many troops need pay, so many secret agents need to eat (Chen: "Right, my secret agents need to eat.") It has gotten to the point where university professors are going on strike, and Ministry of Finance employees are also striking. The Minister of Finance, Yu Hongjun, has no way out. He came to ask me, and I said... I said... I hurried over.
    Soong: What, don't they know that they should serve the country and everyone should be frugal? (Kong and Chen simultaneously: "Yes! Everyone should be frugal!")
    Chiang: Don't all make so much noise, quickly think of a way!
    Kong, Chen: Think of what way?
    Chiang: Think of a way to deal with the Communist Party, a way to deal with the Liberated Areas, a way to rule the people.
    Kong, Chen: We've already thought of that.
    Soong: What way?
    Kong, Chen: Look. (Each takes out a paper card with the word "Fight" written on it, and holds it up respectfully. Chiang and Soong each go to look.)
    Chiang, Soong: Oh! Fight.
    Soong: In the current situation, I have already said that if we drag it out, we will be dragged down, and if we fight, we will also be defeated, but rather than being dragged down, it is better to be defeated by fighting, so let's fight!
    Chiang: If we fight, we must have a way to fight.
    Kong: I have one, (hurries to the right side and takes out a printing press. Soong sees it and says, "I'm an expert at this, I'll help you"). Kong shakes and Soong pulls, pulling out a long strip of paper, all legal tender.
    Chiang: What is this?
    Kong: You ask about this? This is an endless source of wealth, as much as you want! Fighting wars requires money, I shake it fast here, and he pulls out a lot there, do you think it's good?
    Chen: (Pulls out some of the legal tender, shows it to the audience, and quickly puts it in his pocket) This legal tender trick is like a ghost painting, it doesn't even make a sound, but it deceives the money in the hands of the people, it's really good!
    Soong: After the Japanese left, I issued an order: stipulating that one legal tender would be exchanged for two hundred ghost tickets, instantly robbing the hard-earned wealth of the people in the lower Yangtze region, haha...
    Chiang: Haha... good idea, print it! Print more.
    Chen (jealous): Your idea is good, but it's not enough.
    Soong, Kong: What better ideas do you have?
    Chen (smugly): Look at mine. (Makes a dog barking sound: "Woof... He... Woof He... Two secret agents climb up and stand at attention.)
    Chen (tears two legal tender notes): Do you want this?
    Secret agents: Yes, yes, yes!
    Chen: If you want it, will you work for the Chairman?
    Secret agents: Work... work!
    Chen: Work! Good! (Gives the legal tender to the secret agents) You quickly beat up the representatives from Shanghai for me, go, go!
    (Two secret agents rush off shouting "Beat!" Audience shouts slogans: "Oppose secret agents beating people!" "Abolish the secret service organization!")
    Soong: These methods of yours are not fundamental solutions.
    Chiang, Chen, Kong: What fundamental solution do you have?
    Soong: Well, let's see, who does this sky belong to?
    Chiang: It belongs to me, Chiang.
    Chen Kong: I, surnamed Chen, and I, surnamed Kong, and even you, surnamed Soong, have a share.
    Soong: If someone helps us fight the Communist Party, eliminate the Liberated Areas, and suppress the people; and we sell this sky to him, are you willing?
    Chiang: What's wrong with selling it?
    Chen: When I was a poor boy, I had already said that as long as someone buys a piece of sky over my head, I will sell it to him, but no one wants it.
    Soong: Now someone wants it, as long as we sell the aviation rights to the United States, and let American planes fly all over the sky, we can bomb the Liberated Areas into flat ground.
    Chiang: Oh! Bombing the Liberated Areas flat, that's very good! (To Chen) I say, Lifu, quickly issue an order to the mayor of Shanghai, telling him to quickly repair the Shanghai airport, and prepare to welcome American planes. (To the three) I completely agree to this aviation agreement.
    Soong: Furthermore, look at this land, who does all of China's land belong to?
    Chiang: It was all won by me, Chiang.
    Chen Kong: I, surnamed Chen, and I, surnamed Kong, and even you, surnamed Soong, have a share.
    Soong: That's right, let's talk about it again, if someone helps us consolidate our rule, strengthen our army, and help with military pay, and we sell this land to him, are you willing?
    Chiang: Sell it! But how should we sell such a large piece of land?
    Soong: Yes, let American ships and warships enter our inland rivers, so that they can help us transport guns and ammunition; let the Americans build the Yuehan Railway and other railways, so that they can help us transport troops; let the Americans mine the mines in Hunan, and the minerals are also raw materials for making guns and ammunition, give it to him, and he will help us with guns, ammunition, and various weapons, do you think it's good?
    Chiang: What's wrong with that, but what is this called?
    Soong: This has a name, it's called the Inland River Navigation Agreement, the Joint Road Construction Agreement, and the Joint Mining Agreement.
    Chiang: Haha... so many agreements, I can't remember them all, just go ahead and make them!
    Chen: According to the reports of my secret agents, if we let American ships come in, I'm afraid the Sichuan Minsheng Shipping Company will object, because the Chinese shipping industry will collapse!
    Chiang: What does it matter, American ships have always been much more comfortable to ride in than Chinese ships. If they object, it doesn't matter, Lifu, impound all their ships and use them to transport our troops.
    Chen: Yes.
    Soong: Furthermore, we must let American soldiers be stationed in China and fight for us.
    Chiang: All of China belongs to me, Chiang, I can let anyone live here as I please, let them come!
    Chen: I will quickly prepare a thousand pretty girls, and let the American soldiers have a good time. If it's not enough, there are plenty of female students anyway, let them do whatever they want. They won't miss their homes, and they won't want to go back for the rest of their lives.
    Kong: Miss home? Bring all their families to China.
    Soong: These are not enough, we must also let Americans come to China to do business, American goods are all shipped in, Americans can buy houses and land in China, open factories, freely and unrestrictedly (swaggering, bumping into Chiang), this is the mystery of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce.
    Chen: This is good, I have always loved using American goods, they are cheap and beautiful, and when Americans come to China to do business, I don't have to go to America to buy them.
    Kong: Good, I have always done American business, and I can make a lot of money promoting it for him!
    Chiang: Good, that's right, when Americans come to China, I still have to manage the Chinese people, I am still the head, I can still be a dictator, I am still the great emperor of China.
    Soong: Do you agree? Then I'll go invite him.
    Chiang, Kong, Chen: Agree, hurry up and invite him! (The three are busy cleaning up, Chen sweeps the floor, Chiang brushes the dust off his body, Chiang: "Why, the word 'Shame' has fallen on the ground again!" Kong hurriedly goes to paste it back on.)
    Kong: "Reporting to the Chairman, this word 'Shame' can't be pasted on, it falls off again after it's pasted!"
    Chen: Chairman, it doesn't matter if you paste one less word, it's okay to be shameless! Hurry, he's coming.
    Soong: (Walks to the right, bows) Please welcome Marshal Marshall. (Marshall enters, wearing a tall American flag hat, riding boots, and a woolen coat, with "Peace Envoy" pasted on it, holding a dove of peace in his hand.)
    Marshall: How is it going?
    Soong: Everything has been discussed.
    Marshall: Then do it! (Chiang quickly pulls Soong aside.)
    Chiang: (To Soong) How did this happen, look at his appearance, what "peace envoy," I, Chiang, have never loved the word "peace."
    Kong, Chen: (To Soong) What we want is someone to help us fight, why did you bring someone to negotiate?
    Soong: Haha... you don't know, China has been fighting for too long, the people all want peace, and the Communist Party also advocates peace, so we have to use the word "peace" to deceive them, if you don't believe me, look. (Takes off Marshall's coat, revealing Marshall's full military uniform, with an airplane clipped to his belt.)
    Marshall: (Speaking Chinese with a foreign accent) Haha... you don't know, this peace coat is for the Communist Party to see, for the Chinese people to see, so that they are not prepared, so that we can fight them well. (Takes out an airplane, and takes out a cannon from his top hat) This, is a gift for you.
    Chiang (smiling): Good, Great Americans really have a way, so many airplanes and cannons, thank you, thank you, (fawningly shakes hands with Marshall). (Soong takes out the "Sino-American Treaty of Commerce" to sign, then gives it to Chen, Kong, and Chiang to sign)!
    Chiang: Oh! Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, (picks it up and shows it to the audience, then gives it to Marshall) This is a reward for you.
    Soong: From now on, all of China is open to the United States.
    Marshall: (Receives the treaty) Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, good, good, (contemptuously shakes hands with Chiang) (Audience shouts slogans: "Oppose the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce," "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek selling out China," "Oppose American imperialism helping Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war!" Chiang and Marshall are shocked and separate.)
    Marshall: (Angrily) What kind of country is this, how do you manage your country?!
    Chiang: (Angrily) What, the American envoy is here, and they are making trouble again, aren't they slapping my face? Lifu, quickly suppress them for me! (Chen takes out a pistol, stares angrily at the audience, and Chen and Kong exit separately from the left and right.)
    Marshall: (To Chiang, saying a sentence and taking a step forward, Chiang and Soong retreat obsequiously) From now on, your army must fight well, if you don't win any more battles, I will lose my temper.
    Chiang: You are overthinking it, as long as Great America's airplanes and cannons are supplied to us continuously, winning battles is not a problem, we will eliminate the Communist Party in two months, otherwise I won't close my eyes even if I die!
    Marshall: Good, that's good, (shakes hands with Chiang again, the audience shouts slogans: "Please Marshall express your attitude!" "We oppose civil war!" "American troops get out!")
    Marshall: What?
    Soong: It doesn't matter, Chen Lifu has gone down, he has many secret agents, let's talk in peace!
    Marshall: I'll go myself, you Chinese can't handle things, let's go and deceive them together!
    (Marshall puts on the peace coat, holding the dove of peace, and shouts: "Peace! Peace!" Chiang draws his command knife and follows behind, Soong follows Chiang, the audience shouts slogans: "Don't deceive us with that fake peace," "Oppose fake peace," Marshall still shouts: "Peace! Peace!" The three exit from the right.) (End of Act One, to be continued in the next issue)

　　蒋军必败（活报剧）
    边府俱乐部集体创作  周方执笔
    这个活报剧，新年时由边府俱乐部演出，颇受群众欢迎。某村的群众曾要求演二次，某镇一个商人说：“老蒋就是这个样，完蛋啦”。小孩们看了一次，就对人仿学说：“我姓蒋的从来不爱和平这两个字”。当此政协成立一周年，春节将到的时候，我们特介绍出来，供各地采用。但活报是不固定的，演时可酌量添加新内容。
　　　　　——编者
　　　　　
  　第一场  决心卖国打内战
    （出场正中立一屏风，其中门闭住，上粘“礼义廉”三字，“耻”字掉在地上，屏风左右各一牌，左为“主席重室”，右为“人民远离”，锣鼓奏毕，作汽车声，宋子文从右上场，背书“行政院长”，西装。）
    宋：（快板）美国生来美国长，有一个姐姐嫁老蒋，有人若问我是谁？宋子文是我，不是我就是行政院长，（白）在下，宋子文，现在中美商约快要签字，（拿出中美商约自看）这一条好，这一条正对，我早已订了大批美国货，待我问问运来了没有。等我的美国货一到，我就下令“外汇”涨价，使美国票子比法币更值钱，那我就可以挣的更多了，哈哈，打电话问问，（宋走到右口打电话）喂！金山贸易公司……我是你们的掌柜宋子文……我们的美国货运到了没有……快来了……好……用国民政府的名义，下一个命令……提高外汇……涨价涨价……听到了没有，这几天保守秘密。（蒋介石军装配指挥刀，从左口上场。）
    蒋：真把人愁死了。
    宋：你愁什么？姐夫。
    蒋：我愁那一个人。
    宋：你又愁哪一个？刚搞上陈家女儿，十八岁，你又看准了哪一个对象？
    蒋：你弄错了，我就愁着延安那姓毛的，现在这世界，到处都闹共产党，解放区占了半个天，人民都起来要民主，这样闹下去，还有我蒋某的天下吗？我们蒋宋孔陈四家的两百万万美元的家财，也要完蛋啦！得赶快想个办法呀。
    宋：这个可不用愁，我正来向你报告好消息（以手指袋中“中美商约”）。
    蒋：有什么好消息？
    宋：别忙，我们先将老孔老陈请来，大家商议商议。
    蒋：对，我们先开一个蒋宋孔陈四大家族的会议吧！（蒋向右口叫“立夫”，宋向左口叫“老孔”。陈立夫、孔祥熙上，陈着流氓装，身书“特务头子”，孔着长袍马褂肚大腰圆。）
    陈：不好了，不好了。
    蒋：什么事情这样慌里慌张的？
    陈：你听，人民都在要求民主，反对独裁，昆明的学生闹，被我打下去了，重庆在较场口开大会，也被我打下去了，现在上海的和平代表又到了下关车站了。
    （全体观众高呼口号，由一人领导：“要求民主，反对独裁；要求和平，反对内战；要求独立，反对卖国。”）
    蒋（怒向观众，抽出指挥刀）：怎么，你们造反吗？你们要民主！哼！你们还不够资格，还不会行使民权，还要训练训练，你们还不配呵！（其他三人同声称赞：“对，主席说的对。”）
    孔：我的事情才更糟咧！财政经济上大成问题，这么多公务员要薪水，这么多军队要饷，这么多特务要饭吃（陈：“对，我的特务就要吃饭。”）弄得大学教授也罢课啦，财政部职员也罢工啦，财政部长俞鸿钧没有办法，他来问我，我说……我说……我赶忙就来了。
    宋：怎么样，他们不知道为国家服务，应该大家刻苦刻苦吗？（孔、陈同时：“对呀！应该大家刻苦呀！”）
    蒋：你们都不要乱烘烘了，快来想个办法！
    孔、陈：想什么办法？
    蒋：想对付共产党的办法，对付解放区的办法，统治老百姓的办法。
    孔、陈：这个，我们早想好了。
    宋：有什么办法？
    孔、陈：你看（各拿出一张纸牌，上写“打”字，恭恭敬敬的举起，蒋宋各走去看。）
    蒋、宋：呵！打。
    宋：现在这局面，我早已说过，拖下去是拖垮，打下去也是打垮，但与其拖垮，倒不如打垮，还是打吧！
    蒋：打也得有个打的办法。
    孔：我有，（忙至右口拿出一架印钞机。宋见说：“这个，我也内行，我来帮你”。孔摇宋拉，拉出一长条纸，尽是法币）
    蒋：这是什么？
    孔：你问这吗？这是无穷财源，要多少有多少！打仗要花钱，我这里摇得快，他那里就拉得多，你看好不好。
    陈：（扯上一些拉出的法币，给观众看，忙放在口袋中）法币这把戏，就像鬼画符一样，也不吭气，就把老百姓手里的钱骗来了，真好！
    宋：日本走了以后，我下了一道命令：规定一块法币换两百块鬼子票，一下就把下江一带老百姓辛苦积下的资财，都抢光了，哈哈……
    蒋：哈哈……好办法，印吧！多印些。
    陈（吃醋）：你这个好是好，但还不够。
    宋、孔：你有什么更好的呢？
    陈（得意）：你看我的，（作叫狗声：“唔……呵……唔呵……两特务爬上立正）
    陈（扯两张法币）：你们要不要这个。
    特务：要要要！
    陈：要，你们替不替主席办事！
    特务：办……办！
    陈：办事！好！（将法币给特务）你们赶快替我把上海来的代表打一顿，快去，快去！
    （两特务急下呼“打！”观众呼口号：“反对特务打人！”“取消特务组织！”）
    宋：你们这些办法，都还不是根本大计。
    蒋、陈、孔：你有什么根本大计？
    宋：这个么？来，你们看这天是谁的？
    蒋：是我姓蒋的一个人的。
    陈孔：我姓陈的我姓孔的，连你姓宋的都有一份。
    宋：如果有人帮助我们打共产党，消灭解放区，镇压人民；将这天卖了与他，你们愿意么？
    蒋：有什么不可以卖。
    陈：我从前是穷小子的时候，早已说过，只要有人买我头上一块天，我准卖给他，就是没有人要。
    宋：现在可有人要，只要将航空权卖与美国，让美国的飞机满天飞，就可以把解放区炸成平地。
    蒋：呵！把解放区炸平，好得很，（对陈）我说，立夫，赶快下个命令给上海市长，叫他快修上海飞机场，准备迎接美国飞机，（对三人）这个航空协定，我完全同意。
    宋：还有，你们看这地，这全中国的地是谁的？
    蒋：都是我姓蒋的一个人打出来的。
    陈孔：我姓陈的，我姓孔的，连你姓宋的，也有一份。
    宋：对，话又说回来了，有人帮助我们巩固统治，加强军队，帮助军饷，将这地卖了与他，你们愿意么？
    蒋：卖吧！可是这大一块地，怎么个卖法呢？
    宋：有，让美国的轮船兵舰，开进我们的内河，那就可以帮助我们运枪炮子弹；让美国人去修粤汉铁路，和其他的铁路，那就可以帮助我们运兵；让美国人去湖南的矿山上开矿，那矿也是造枪炮子弹的原料，送给他，他就帮助我们枪炮子弹，各种武器，你们看好不好？
    蒋：这有什么不好，可是这又叫什么名堂呢？
    宋：这个有，这叫内河航行协定，共同筑路协定，共同采矿协定。
    蒋：哈哈……这么多协定，我也记不清，你尽管订吧！
    陈：据我的特务的报告，要是让美国轮船开进来，恐怕四川民生轮船公司要反对，因为中国的轮船业就要垮台呵！
    蒋：这有什么要紧，美国的轮船坐起来向来就比中国轮船要舒服得多。他们要是反对，不要紧，立夫，把他们的轮船通通扣起来，替我们运兵。
    陈：是。
    宋：还有，要让美国兵来驻在中国，替我们打仗。
    蒋：中国的地方都是我姓蒋的一个人的，我要请谁住，谁就可以随随便便的住，叫他们来吧！
    陈：我赶紧预备下千把个漂亮姑娘，让美国兵好好的消遣。要是不够，反正有的是女学生，让他们随便搞去就是他们不想家，一辈子也不肯回去了。
    孔：想家吗！把他们的家眷统统接到中国来。
    宋：这些都还不够，还要让美国人来中国做生意，美国货通通运进来，美国人可以在中国买房置地，开工厂，自由自在，横冲直撞（大摇大摆将蒋闯了一下），这就是中美商约的奥妙。
    陈：这个好，我向来爱用美国货，又便宜又漂亮，美国人来中国做生意，省得我上美国买去。
    孔：好，我本来做的就是美国生意，我替他推销，那又可以挣一笔大钱！
    蒋：好，不错，美国人到中国，还得叫我管理中国老百姓，我还是个头，还可独裁，我还是中国的大皇帝。
    宋：你们同意了吗？那我就去请他去。
    蒋、孔、陈：同意，你赶快去请吧！（三人忙着打扫收拾，陈扫地，蒋打身上的灰，蒋：“怎么，耻字又掉在地下了！”孔赶忙去粘。）
    孔：“报告主席，这耻字老粘不上，粘上去又掉了！”
    陈：主席，少粘一个字不要紧，无耻就无耻吧！快，人家来了。
    宋：（走至右口，鞠躬）有请马歇尔元帅：（马歇尔上，高顶美国花旗帽，马靴，呢大衣，上粘“和平使者”，手拿和平之鸽。
    马：怎么样？
    宋：都商议好了。
    马：那就办吧！（蒋急扯宋至一边。）
    蒋：（对宋）这是怎么弄的，你看他那样子，什么“和平使者”，我姓蒋的从来不爱“和平”这两个字。
    孔、陈：（对宋）我们要的是帮助打仗的，你怎么找来个讲和的。
    宋：哈哈…你们不知道，中国打仗打得太久了，老百姓都要求和平，共产党也主张和平，所以得用和平这二个字，去欺骗他们，不信，你们看。（为马脱大衣，现出马的全身军装，皮带上夹一个飞机。）
    马：（打着外国人说中国话的调子）哈哈……你们不知道，这件和平大衣，是给共产党看的，是给中国的老百姓看的，叫他们不防备，我们才好打他，（拿出飞机，从高帽子里拿出炮）这，是送给你的礼物。
    蒋（笑）：好，大美国人真有办法，这么多飞机大炮，谢谢，谢谢，（巴结地与马握手）（宋拿出“中美商约”签字，再给陈、孔、蒋签字）！
    蒋：呵！中美商约，（拿起给观众周览，然后给马）这是送给您的酬劳。
    宋：今后全部中国统统向美国开放。
    马：（接商约）中美商约，好好，（轻蔑地与蒋握手）（观众高呼口号：“反对中美商约”，“反对蒋介石出卖中国”，“反对美帝国主义帮助蒋介石打内战！”蒋马大惊分手）
    马：（怒）怎么，你们这是什么国家，你们对国家怎么管理的？！
    蒋：（怒）怎么，美国特使在这里，他们又来胡闹，不是刮我的脸皮吗？立夫，快去给我镇压（陈拿出手枪，怒视观众与孔分别由左右下场）。
    马：（对蒋说一句逼进一步，蒋宋唯唯退）以后你们的军队，得好好打仗，再不打胜仗，我就要发脾气罗。
    蒋：你过虑了，只要有大美国的飞机大炮，源源供给我们，打胜仗不成问题，两个月消灭共产党，不然我死了也不闭眼睛呵！
    马：好，这就好，（又与蒋握手，观众高呼口号：“请马歇尔表示态度！”“我们反对内战！”“美国军队滚出去！”）
    马：怎么？
    宋：不要紧，陈立夫下去了，他的特务很多，我们安心谈吧！
    马：我自己去，你们中国人办不了事，还是跟我一同来骗他们一下吧！
    （马穿起和平大衣，手拿和平之鸽，高叫：“和平！和平呀！”蒋抽出指挥刀随在后面，宋随蒋，观众呼口号：“不要拿那假和平欺骗我们，”“反对假和平”，马仍高叫：“和平！和平呀！”三人由右口下场）。（第一场完，余下期续完）
