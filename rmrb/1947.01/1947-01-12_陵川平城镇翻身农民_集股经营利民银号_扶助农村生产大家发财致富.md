　　Lingchuan Pingcheng Town Turning-Over Farmers
　　Collectively Operate the Limin Bank
　　Helping Rural Production for Everyone to Prosper and Become Wealthy
　　[Report from this newspaper, Lingchuan] The first "Limin Bank" in Lingchuan's Pingcheng Town, operated by the turning-over masses themselves with shares, is thriving under the support of the democratic government. The bank has collectively raised over 2.74 million yuan in shares. The turning-over farmers in all 31 administrative villages in the region are vying to invest, with the number of shareholders accounting for 69.6% of the total households in the region. The new middle peasants' share capital accounts for more than 46% of the total. Yangzhai Village originally planned to invest 80,000 yuan, but received 113,000 yuan in share payments. Women in Jinjialing Village sold their silver earrings and other jewelry to invest in shares. Carpenter Pan Xixin invested 2,500 yuan of his earned wages.
　　Within two months of its establishment, the Limin Bank assumed the task of circulating rural finance and supporting agricultural production. It organized 256 textile and transportation groups (1,681 people) and nine village cooperatives, as well as five iron smelters, and provided loans totaling 2.5 million yuan. Li Chunfu's mutual aid group in Pingcheng, with three people, raised 4,000 yuan themselves and borrowed 25,000 yuan. After one month of transportation production, they earned more than 40,000 yuan in foreign currency and bought a sow, which gave birth to seven piglets. It has also played a significant role in supporting the business of small merchants. In two months, 27 small merchants in Pingcheng Town received 800,000 yuan in commercial loans, and their businesses have generally become prosperous. Hou Yaohai, manager of a small grocery store, gratefully said of the Limin Bank's loan: "If it weren't for the Limin Bank's help, my business would have closed down long ago." In two months, the Limin Bank has received 1.5 million yuan in savings deposits. Jin Changfa's mutual aid group in Jinjialing used the money earned from the loan to buy a rifle at the county armory. They stated: "We will use this gun to protect our Limin Bank!"
