　　Taiyue Troops
    Enthusiastically Launch Jiao Wubao Movement
    Widely Introduce Through Storytelling and Other Methods
    [Report from the Taiyue Front, January 14th, by our newspaper] Since the 407th unit proposed launching the Jiao Wubao movement, it has attracted the attention of various troops. The First Battalion began a general inspection of this work, summarized the experiences of the companies, and the Third Battalion held a meeting of cadres above the squad level to explain the significance of the Jiao Wubao movement. The Kong Suoxi mutual aid group of the Ninth Company challenged Jiao Wubao, guaranteeing to take two new soldiers to the battlefield. The soldiers accepted Jiao Wubao's experience, constantly introducing combat experience through storytelling to embolden new soldiers, creating a general atmosphere of learning from Jiao Wubao. In order to strengthen the cultivation of Jiao Wubao and further launch the Jiao Wubao movement, the unit specially collected materials and wrote news reports in a timely manner, strengthening the propaganda and education of the unit's newspaper. Every piece of news about Jiao Wubao was disclosed with large headlines. The cadres of the Third Battalion also formulated a specific plan for carrying out the Jiao Wubao movement: First, arouse the attention and understanding of the soldiers in their minds. The qualities and experience of Jiao Wubao should be promoted in the company's classes, drills, and roll calls. Second, transform the old mutual aid groups, re-implement democratic discussions, conduct new democratic elections, and propose the following standards for the heads of mutual aid groups: listen to the opinions of the masses, be actively responsible, bravely fight, and care for new soldiers. Third, regularly check the understanding and development of mutual aid groups both inside and outside the Party. The unit also decided to help Jiao Wubao's mutual aid group so that it could further develop. This work is now in full swing.
