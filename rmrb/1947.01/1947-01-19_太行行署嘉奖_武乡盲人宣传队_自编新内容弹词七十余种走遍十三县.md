　　Composing Over Seventy New Ballads and Touring Thirteen Counties
　　[From our Changzhi News] The Blind Propaganda Team under the leadership of the Wuxiang County Propaganda Committee recently concluded its work in Moyu Village, Wuxiang County. Over the past few years, in order to deeply promote patriotic war propaganda and promote the movements of emancipation and production, the team has composed over seventy kinds of ballads and drum songs with themes of combat, emancipation, and production stories, which they sang and performed to the masses everywhere, touring 1,985 villages in thirteen counties including Changzhi, Yushe, Licheng, Tunliu, and Taigu. The effect was enormous. The summary also included discussions on collecting subject matter and improving writing and singing techniques, and how to further make the songs and performances easy for the masses to understand and like. The team was founded in 1938 and has more than 30 blind members. During the Anti-Japanese War, they never stopped their activities even in extremely difficult times, and they supported themselves through their own production. Recently, they received a clear commendation from the Taihang Administrative Office, and their enthusiasm is even higher. Currently, the team is running a school for the blind in Wenzhuang, Wuxiang, training singing and performance skills, with 30 young blind people enrolled.

    【本报长治讯】武乡县宣委会领导之盲人宣传队，近在该县陌峪村总结工作。数年来该队为深入爱国战争宣传，及推动翻身、生产等运动，自编以战斗、翻身、生产故事为题材的弹词、大鼓书等达七十余种，到处向群众说唱，走遍长治、榆社、黎城、屯留、太谷等十三县，一千九百八十五个村庄。效果极大。总结中并曾讨论收集题材与提高编写，说唱技术，如何进一步使群众爱听易懂等问题。该队成立于三八年，有盲人三十余人。抗战中在极困苦时期亦未停止过活动，并自己生产维持生活。最近曾获得太行行署的明令奖励，热情更高。现该队在武乡温庄开办一盲人学校，训练弹唱技术，入学青年盲人达三十人。
