    Fourth District of Qinyuan Improves Weaving Technology
    Actively Develops Spring Weaving
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] The weaving movement in the Fourth District of Qinyuan has come to an end at the end of the lunar year, and is now actively preparing for a large-scale weaving movement after the spring begins. (1) Step up the training of weavers as the backbone to guide weaving throughout the district. Eight women have been selected from Song Tingxiu Weaving Cooperative in Wangbi Village to study the use of shuttle looms at the public weaving factory. Zhu Linfeng Weaving Group in Han Hong Village has also selected four women to study there. At the invitation of various villages, Duan Lao Tai-tai, a weaving hero from Dinghu Village, is teaching weaving skills everywhere. In addition, weaving workshops have been established in Hang Village, Xingshao Village, and other villages, and technicians are specially invited to guide weaving. (2) Prepare cotton. Because of the Lunar New Year, mass transportation has been suspended, and cotton is not easy to come by. Therefore, cotton was prepared quickly before the New Year, and weaving will be carried out as soon as the Spring Festival is over. The Dinghu Village Cooperative concentrated its efforts to organize the transportation of cotton in December and provided loans to women to purchase it. Now, all the women in the village have saved six catties of cotton per person. (3) Actively purchase cotton ginning tools; because the Fourth District is cold and does not grow cotton, women rarely weaved in the past, and there were even fewer cotton ginning workers. The most difficult thing for women's weaving last winter was that the supply of cotton ginning could not meet the demand. Therefore, the Chengbi Village Cooperative purchased cotton bows and specially invited cotton ginning craftsmen from Qin County to provide guidance. The District Federation of Cooperatives also raised funds to purchase cotton ginning machines. (4) Cooperatives in various villages actively gathered carpenters to manufacture weaving tools for women. In addition to organizing carpenters to repair tools for weaving women, Wangbi, Dinghu, Hanhong and other cooperatives also sent special personnel to purchase shuttle looms from outside. The Fourth District Federation of Cooperatives also organized personnel to collect weaving experience in various villages, widely publicize and exchange it, in order to promote the large-scale spring weaving movement.

    沁源四区提高织妇技术
    积极开展春季纺织
    【本报太岳廿七日电】沁源四区纺织运动在阴历年底已告一段落，现正积极准备开春后的大规模纺织运动。（一）加紧培养织妇，作为指导全区纺织的骨干。王壁村宋廷秀纺织社内已抽出八个妇女至公营纺织厂学习使用拉梭机。韩洪村朱林凤纺织组亦抽出四个妇女前住学习。定湖村纺织英雄段老太太应各村之请，到处传授织布技术，此外杭村、兴捎等村均已成立纺织所，专请技师指导织布。（二）准备棉花。因过旧历年，群众运输暂停，棉花不易来，因此年前赶速准备了棉花，一过春节，便进行纺织。定湖村合作社在腊月间集中力量组织运输棉花，并贷款给妇女购买，现全村妇女每人积蓄了六斤棉花。（三）积极购买弹花工具；四区因地寒素不种棉花，以往妇女纺织很少，弹棉花的工人更少，去冬妇女纺织中最感困难的是弹花供不应求，因此程壁村合作社购买弹弓，特请沁县弹花工匠指导，区联社并集款购买弹花机。（四）各村合作社积极集中木匠，为妇女制造纺织工具，王壁、定湖、韩洪等合作社除组织木匠为纺织妇女修理工具外，并派专人去外边购买拉梭机。四区区联社并组织人员分头到各村搜集纺织经验，广为宣传与交流，以推动春季大规模的纺织运动。
