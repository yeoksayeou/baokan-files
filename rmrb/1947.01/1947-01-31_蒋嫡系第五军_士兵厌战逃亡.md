    Chiang Kai-shek's Direct Lineage 5th Army
    Soldiers Desert Due to War Weariness
    [Our newspaper, Jin-Lu-Yu Front, 29th dispatch] Soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage 5th Army are weary of war and deserting in droves. Of the twenty-six young men seized in Yuguantun, Juye, twenty-five have already deserted and returned; only one child has not returned. When the 5th Army was stationed in Liuzhuang, Junan (Xin County), an old Mr. Liu asked the adjutant staying in his house, "What are you sticking on that book all day long, Lao Zong?" "You don't understand, this is our roster." This adjutant pasted the names of the conscripted strongmen over the names of the deserting soldiers every day. Some were covered with layers of names, and some cells had three or four layers of names pasted on them.
          (Yong Jin)
    [Our newspaper, Jin-Lu-Yu Front, 29th dispatch] The Chiang army authorities are extremely alarmed by the increasingly high anti-war sentiment among their officers and soldiers, and are therefore issuing orders at all levels to implement fascist mail censorship within their army in an attempt to suppress and prevent it. According to the loyalty report No. 634 of the Political Department of the Kuomintang Army's reorganized 64th Brigade, captured by the Eighth Route Army on the Jin-Lu-Yu front on December 26th of last year, "The following is an excerpt from the Suijing (referring to the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters Political Department) Limin character No. 0880 telegram: 'According to a telegram from the summit: Chen Fuduan, son of Chen Huanting, a family member of a soldier from Shijiaba, Xiyang County, is a platoon leader in Sun Zhen's unit. He sent a letter from the front to his father, saying, "After eight years of resistance against Japan, I am homesick. Unexpectedly, the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has started again, causing soldiers to be weary of war, and the National Army often feels disappointed," which has greatly affected morale and national psychology. The relevant departments should be instructed to pay attention to the inspection of correspondence between officers and soldiers in the troops.'"

    蒋嫡系第五军
    士兵厌战逃亡
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】蒋军嫡系第五军士兵厌战，纷纷逃亡，在巨野禹官屯抓走的二十六个青年，现已有二十五个开小差逃回来，仅有一个孩子没有回来。当第五军在巨南（新县）刘庄住时，一位刘老先生问住在他家的副官说：“你整天在那个本子上贴啥，老总？”“你不懂，这是我们的花名册。”这位副官每天都在将抓来的壮丁的名字贴到逃亡士兵的名字上，有的一张张的贴遍了，有的一个格子里贴了三四层。

    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】蒋军当局对其官兵日益高涨的厌战情绪极为恐慌，乃层层督令在其军队内部实行法西斯的信件检查，以图压制防范。据冀鲁豫前线八路军缴获之蒋军整编第六十四旅政治部于去年十二月二十六日所发忠情字第六三四号代电内称：“层奉绥政（按即绥署政治部）力民字○八八○号代电略开，奉层峰电：×阳县施家坝出征军人家属陈焕廷之子陈服段在孙震部任排长，由前方寄信予其父，谓‘抗战八年，思家心切，孰料国共战事又起，致士兵厌战，国军常感失望’等语，影响士气及国民心理甚巨，应饬所部注意部队中官兵来往信件之检查。”
