　　Seize the Time and Hurry Up!
    Shimin Completes Land Reform
    Ji County Eliminates Extreme Poverty Throughout the County
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd dispatch] According to a report from the Shimin County Farmers' Association: In the past half month, the entire county has swept away feudal forces and completed land reform. Farmers have recovered 4,032 mu of land, 3,360 rooms, 4,027 cattle and sheep, and 70,923 shi of grain. The steps taken were: first, to concentrate the landlords who had not been thoroughly struggled against in the general liquidation, and the peasants all complained together. In less than sixteen days, a new high tide of complaining and liquidation swept across the county. However, the peasants still dealt with them according to their severity, first struggling against the big bullies and big landlords, and then the small and medium landlords and feudal rich peasants. After Guo Bi Village struggled against the big landlord Wang Yuan, they only used persuasion methods to make the small landlord Wang Qitai withdraw from the land. The second step was to distribute the fruits. The distribution method was that each village completely concentrated all the fruits and distributed them at one time. The evaluation standards were: 1. The distribution was divided into grades based on the amount of land, such as Guo Bi Village dividing the grades according to wealth and land, first distributing land to eliminate extreme poverty, and then filling in clothes and utensils as needed. 2. Distribution was completely according to needs, such as Pan Village, Li Village, and Huan Village, where the management committee announced all the fruits, allowing the masses to report their needs, and then distributing them after everyone discussed and approved. 3. Land and houses were distributed according to needs, and movable property was divided into grades according to the number of people participating in the struggle and distributed uniformly. Currently, all extremely poor farmers in the county have been eliminated. Before the struggle in Pan Village, all seven extremely poor households and ninety poor households rose in status, with an average of 4.29 mu of land per person, and an average of 4.23 mu per person for middle peasants. Currently, cadres and the masses throughout the county are conducting ideological self-examination, and the Lantern Festival is designated as the county's celebration of liberation.
    [This newspaper, Wei County, 23rd dispatch] Ji County has victoriously completed land reform and eliminated landlord feudal exploitation. There is no more extreme poverty in the county, and 60% of poor peasants have risen to the status of middle peasants. The organization of the masses in the entire region has reached 53% of the total population, and the number of households has reached more than 80%. During the movement, the families of poor military laborers have all obtained more than three mu of land. Many soldiers who had asked for leave and not returned were deeply moved and asked to return to their units. The status of the families of military laborers who obtained land has greatly improved in the countryside. They wrote letters to the front, urging their sons to win more victories. Secondly, the broad masses of women actively participated in the movement and leadership, and the masses' awareness and political vigilance were greatly improved. Based on the past words and deeds of the stubborn forces and the confirmed facts of destruction, eighteen special agent organizations such as the "Armed Homecoming Vanguard" were tracked down. Most of the deceived elements have repented to the masses. The stubborn forces' attempt to organize armed forces and wait for a change of regime to continue to rule the masses has been shattered, and the masses' enthusiasm is growing.

　　抓紧时间赶快作！
    士敏完成土地改革
    冀县全县消灭赤贫
    【本报太岳廿三日电】据士敏县农会报导：全县半个月来已扫清封建势力，完成了土地改革。农民收回土地四千零三十二亩，房屋三千三百六十间，牛羊四千零二十七只，粮食七万零九百二十三石。其进行步骤，第一步把总清算未斗彻底的地主集中起来，农民一齐诉苦，不到十六天时间，全县漫延起新的诉苦清算高潮，但农民仍分别轻重处理，先斗大恶霸大地主，然后中小地主与封建富农。郭必村在斗罢大地主王源之后，对小地主王启太仅用说服办法使其退出土地。第二步分配果实。其分配办法是各村将所有果实完全集中，一次分配，评定标准：一、以土地多少为主划分等级分配，如郭必村依贫富土地多少分等级后，先分配土地消灭赤贫，然后再按需填补衣服及用具。二、完全按需要分配，如潘庄、李庄、缓村将所有果实由保管委员会公布，让群众报需要然后经大家讨论通过进行分配。三、土地房屋按需分配，动产按参加斗争人数划为等级统一分。现全县赤贫农全部消灭。潘庄村斗争前七户赤贫、九十户贫农全部上升，每人平均四亩二分九厘土地，中农每人平均四亩二分三厘。现全县干部与群众又展开思想检查，并定元宵节为全县庆祝翻身节。
    【本报威县二十三日电】冀县已胜利完成土地改革，消灭了地主封建剥削。全县已无赤贫，贫农上升中农者达百分之六十，全区组织群众已达全人口百分之五十三，户数达百分之八十以上。运动中贫苦军工属都已获得三亩以上土地，许多请假未归的战士，深深感动，纷纷要求归队。得到土地的军工家属在农村中的地位大大提高，他们纷纷往前方写信，嘱咐他们的子弟多打胜仗。其次是广大妇女积极参加了运动和领导，群众觉悟及政治警惕性大大提高了，根据封顽势力以往言行及确实之破坏事实，追出潜伏之“武装还乡先锋队”等特务组织十八股，多数被骗分子已向群众悔过。封顽势力企图组织武装，等待变天继续统治群众的阴谋，已被粉碎，群众情绪愈益高涨。
