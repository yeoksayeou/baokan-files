    Guarantee Comprehensive Filling

    Licheng County Government Decides on Immigration Measures

    105 Households Have Been Relocated, and New Homes Have Been Arranged

    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] The Licheng County Government recently instructed various districts and villages to implement partial immigration to regulate farmers' land and achieve comprehensive filling. The instructions stated: In the fifth, sixth, and most of the fourth district's villages, due to their mountainous location, the average land per person is less than three mu, and the soil quality is poor. After the thorough elimination of feudalism, the land obtained by farmers is still insufficient to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, within the county, the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts can implement partial immigration and transfer retired soldiers to the first, second, and third districts, which have ample land. The proposed relocation measures are as follows: 1. Relocating households must be poor farmers and retired soldiers in the original village who still cannot maintain their livelihoods after land reform; 2. Foreigners from other counties must hold a letter of introduction from their respective county governments when settling in this county to avoid the phenomenon of settling in both places; 3. All real estate (land, houses) of immigrants shall be handed over to the land reform committee or farmers of the original village and distributed to local poor farmers; grain, clothing, furniture, etc., shall be handled by the immigrants themselves. 4. Immigrants shall enjoy the same rights as local farmers in the villages they relocate to when distributing fruits. Special care should be given to retired soldiers and the families of poor cadres and soldiers. The instructions finally emphasized: Villages should strengthen the education of "farmers all over the world are one family" to inspire farmers' class love and eliminate some farmers' xenophobic ideas. Currently, the county has relocated 105 farming households and 16 retired soldiers, and new homes have been properly arranged.

    保证全面填平
    黎城县政府决定移民办法
    全县已转移一○五户，新家均已安置好
    【本报长治讯】黎城县府顷指示各区村，实行部分移民，以调剂农民土地，达到全面填平。指示中称：五六区及四区大部村庄，因处山地，每人平均土地不足三亩，且土质低劣，彻底消灭封建后，农民所获土地仍不足维持生活，因此在本县范围内，四、五、六区可向土地宽广的一、二、三区实行部分移民与转移荣退军人。并拟定迁移办法如下：迁移户必须是在原村翻身后仍不能维持生活的贫农与荣退军人，二、外县客民在本县安家时，须持有所属县府的介绍信，以免两边安家的现象；三、移民原有财产，凡属不动产（土地、房屋）一律交给原村翻身委员会或农民，分给当地贫苦农民；至于粮食、衣服、家具等，则由移民自行处理。四、移民所至各村，在分配果实时与当地农民享有同等权利。对荣退军人与贫苦干属军属则应多加照顾。指示最后强调提出：各村要加强“天下农民是一家”的教育，以启发农民阶级友爱，解除某些农民的排外思想。现该县已转移一百零五户农民，十六户荣退军人，新的家庭也已安置妥当。
