[This Newspaper's Jin-Lu-Yu Dispatch of the 19th] The frontline units are carrying out the Wang Keqin mutual aid movement, which has yielded great results in both study and life. In particular, it has played a significant role in helping veteran soldiers lead new recruits in eliminating the enemy and reducing casualties. In the Battle of Nanrenzhuang, the Guo Shumin Platoon's mutual aid team of a certain unit quickly occupied nine courtyards, seized three infantry guns, two or three dozen rifles, and captured fifty or sixty enemies. In the Shangguan Village battle, two newly enlisted peasant soldiers and two newly liberated soldiers in the Guo Dangshan Platoon were very organized and captured four anti-tank guns, without a single casualty in the platoon. The seven squads of a certain unit voluntarily combined to form mutual aid teams, with the team leaders democratically elected. In the Battle of Hua County, Zhang Kailiang, the leader of the sixth squad, was covered in sores, but he resolutely refused to fall behind and even took other people's guns to carry, ensuring that no one in the entire squad fell behind. The veteran soldiers in the mutual aid teams generally introduced combat experience to the new soldiers. Li Yujun, a veteran soldier in the sixth squad, told the new soldiers in the squad how to dig fortifications and approach the enemy. At the platoon leaders' joint meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that with mutual aid teams, any task can be accomplished.

    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】前线各部队开展王克勤互助运动，在学习和生活上都收到很大效果，尤其在老战士带领新战士消灭敌人减少伤亡上，起了很大作用。某部五分队郭树敏排互助组，在南任庄战斗中，迅速占领了九座院子，缴获步兵炮三门，步枪二三十支，俘虏五六十个敌人。郭当山排内有两个新参军的翻身农民和两个新解放过来的战士，在上官村战斗中，很有组织，缴获四门反坦克炮，而该排没有一个伤亡。某部七小队自愿结合，组成互助组，组长都是民主选举的，在滑县战役中，六班的组长张开良同志满身生疮，但他坚决不掉队，还夺别人的枪来背，保证了全组没一个掉队的。互助组里的老战士普遍的向新战士介绍战斗经验。六班老战士李玉俊告诉班里的新战士们怎样挖工事，接近敌人。在排长联席会议上大家一致认为有了互助组，什么任务都能完成。
