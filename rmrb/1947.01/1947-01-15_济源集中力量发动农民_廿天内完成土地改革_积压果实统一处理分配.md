　　Jiyuan Concentrates Efforts to Mobilize Peasants
	Completes Land Reform in Twenty Days
  	Unified Handling and Distribution of Accumulated Gains
    [Our newspaper Taiyue 13th dispatch] In Jiyuan Third District, all twenty-eight administrative villages have realized "land to the tiller" within twenty days. On December 13th, the Third District Land Reform Committee was established to uniformly lead the land reform movement throughout the district. It organized cadres from various systems, divided them into ten base points, and proposed to strive for the completion of land reform in the entire district within one month. As soon as the cadres arrived in the villages, they launched in-depth propaganda and mobilization for "land to the tiller," loudly proclaiming "total liquidation and complete liberation," thoroughly resolving the farmers' land problem, and preparing to develop a large-scale production movement. Due to the large scale of this movement, it quickly entered a climax. Not only did the poorest peasants resolutely demand land and houses, but the broad masses of middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants also immediately joined the movement. At the first joint meeting of base point team leaders in the district, most villages had already begun action, and more than half of the villages had entered the struggle for land. The two administrative villages of Liucun and Xinzhuang completed land reform in only sixteen days. They held a liberation celebration meeting on the 23rd. In addition, sixteen administrative villages including Shangzhuang, Xiyaotou, and Renzhai have all entered the stage of posting announcements, distributing the fruits of the struggle, burying land boundary markers, and creating new contracts. The remaining ten administrative villages, including Xiayucheng Village and Shabi, will complete land reform around New Year's Day at the latest. The gains from this struggle and the gains accumulated in the past that have not been distributed are all handled and distributed uniformly by the Land Reform Committee. This struggle mostly uses a comprehensive approach, with everyone conducting a general liquidation of various issues separately. For example, in Shangzhuang, twenty-eight liquidation targets were proposed within the citizens' group. After separate research by the Land Reform Committee, it was decided that thirty-three households should be liquidated. Seven were liquidated in one day at a mass meeting, and the remaining households were liquidated separately, completing all liquidations within two days. The distribution of fruits is done through self-reporting and public discussion, with democratic decisions. After the peasants recovered their land, they were extremely excited. Villages such as Liucun and Xinzhuang held celebrations of their liberation, established Liberation Day, erected liberation monuments, and sent troops to the front lines to express their gratitude. Preparations have now begun to transfer forces to carry out land reform movements in the peripheral villages after the task is completed.

　　济源集中力量发动农民
    廿天内完成土地改革
  　积压果实统一处理分配
    【本报太岳十三日电】济源三区二十八个行政村，二十天内已全部实现耕者有其田。十二月十三日成立三区土地改革委员会，统一领导全区的土地改革运动，组织了各系统的干部，划分十个基点，提出要在一月内争取全区完成土地改革。干部们一到村里就展开了耕者有其田的深入宣传动员，响亮的提出了“总清算齐翻身”，彻底解决农民的土地问题，准备发展大生产运动。由于这次运动的规模较大，很快便进入高潮，不仅赤贫农坚决的要求土地房屋，广大中农和富裕中农也都马上卷入了运动。区里召开第一次基点小组长联席会议时，大部村庄都已开始了行动，半数以上村庄已进入了要地的斗争。留村、新庄两个行政村，只用了十六天工夫就完成土地改革。他们在二十三号即举行了翻身庆祝大会。另有尚庄、西窑头、任寨等十六个行政村，都已进入到出榜公布分配斗争果实，埋地界牌，成新契约。下余程村、沙逼等十个行政村，最晚将于元旦左右全部完成土地改革。这次斗争所获果实和过去积压未分配之果实，都由土地改革委员会统一处理分配，这次斗争多用一揽子方式，对各种问题由大家分头进行总清算。如尚庄经公民小组内提出了二十八个清算对象，经土地改革委员会分别研究后，决定应该清算的有三十三户，一天内群众大会上即清算了七个，其余的户分头去算，两天内即全结束清算完毕。果实分配是自报公议的方式，民主决定。农民收回土地之后，兴奋异常，如留村新庄等，都召开了庆祝翻身大会，定出翻身节，立下翻身纪念碑，到前线劳军。现已开始准备将于任务结束后，抽调力量开展边沿村庄的土地改革运动。
