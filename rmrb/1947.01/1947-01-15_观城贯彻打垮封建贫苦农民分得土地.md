[This dispatch from the Jilu Yu Border Region on the 13th of this month] The land reform movement in the fourth district of Guancheng is underway, with Majhuang taking the lead in achieving victory. Majhuang was originally an old liberated area. Although there was no extreme poverty among the village's hundred-plus households, the struggle was not thorough enough. Local bullies and landlords like Zhang Chongliang continued to oppress and beat the masses. After several days of preparation, four to five hundred organized people launched a struggle against these local bullies and landlords, recovering twenty-nine mu of land and other property. The main reason for Majhuang's victory was the good democratic work style and the close attention paid to the small group meetings. All issues, such as offering opinions on the targets of struggle and the specific amount of stolen goods, were discussed in small group meetings. They proposed, "If there is no consensus in the small group meetings, we will not hold a large meeting," so everyone's level of awareness was very high.
    [Another dispatch] Dong Liuhai in this district is a small village of seventy-odd households. Local bullies and landlords Zhang Xinjing and Guo Kuanhuai used petty favors to buy off and divide the masses. The peasant association only had eighteen households and was very isolated. After studying the situation in the village, the leadership detained the stubborn elements Zhang Xinjing and Guo Kuanhuai to support the masses. Through speaking bitterness and reasoning, the struggle unfolded, and the masses were finally liberated. Impoverished and poor peasants have received an average of more than two mu of land per person. The deceived masses also realized, "I was fooled by Zhang Xinjing." Several deceived households awakened and joined the peasant association.

　　观城贯彻打垮封建贫苦农民分得土地
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】观城四区的土地改革运动正在开展，马庄首先取得了胜利。马庄本是老解放区，全村百余户中，虽已没有赤贫，但斗争不彻底，恶霸地主张重良等仍然欺压打骂群众。经过几天的酝酿，四五百有组织的群众，向恶霸地主展开斗争，收回土地二十九亩与其他财物。马庄斗争胜利的主要原因，是民主作风好，小组会抓的紧，一切问题如对斗争对象提意见及倒赃的具体数目等，都经过小组会，他们提出“小组会意见不一致，就不开大会”，因此大家自觉的程度很高。
    【又讯】该区东刘海是个七十来户的小村，恶霸地主张心敬、郭宽怀使用小恩小惠，收买分化群众，农会员只有十八户，很孤立。领导上研究该村情况后，把顽固分子张心敬、郭宽怀扣起来，给群众撑腰，诉苦说理，斗争随展开，群众才翻了身，赤贫与贫农每人已平均得到二亩以上土地。被骗的群众也觉悟说：“我是上了张心敬的当了”被骗的几户都觉悟参加了农会。
