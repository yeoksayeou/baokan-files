    Xiliang Completes Land Reform
    Peasants Joyfully Move into New Houses
    [This Newspaper, Weixian, 5th Dispatch] After land reform, Xiliang Village, Yaoshan, peasants obtained eight *qing* of land and 210 houses, with each person averaging more than three *mu* of land and having housing. To move into new homes and welcome the New Year, the whole village decided on an auspicious day for moving. Early in the morning, each family sprinkled the streets with clean water and padded the roads with yellow earth. The Farmers' Association, Women's Association, and Children's League, etc., holding colorful flags, carried "incense tables" in a procession. The tables were inscribed with "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Celebrating the Joy of Moving." Militiamen carrying guns guarded both sides, with gongs and drums sounding and slogans rising. Women and the masses stood in front of the doors of wealthy households, respectfully saluting as the incense tables passed by. Peasant Erxi said: "I have never had a house to live in my whole life, but now I have a place to live. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to turn over, I wouldn't even have a place to put my spirit after I die."

    西良完成土地改革
    农民欢欣迁居新屋
    【本报威县五日电】尧山西良村经过土地改革，农民获得土地八顷，房屋二百一十间，每人平均合三亩以上土地，都有了房住。为迁居新房迎接新年，全村议定搬家吉日，各家早起清水泼街，黄土垫道，农会、妇会、儿童团等，手持各色彩旗，抬着“香案”，整队游行，案上写着“毛主席万岁”，“庆贺迁居之禧。”两旁民兵携枪卫护，锣鼓喧天，口号四起，花户门前站着妇女和群众，见香案过来，都恭敬行礼。农民二喜说：“一辈子没房住，这可有住的了。要没有共产党毛主席领导我们翻身，临死我也没有个放灵的地方”。
