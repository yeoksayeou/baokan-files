　　*National Weekly* Demands Truman Immediately Withdraw American Troops Stationed in China
　　And states: "The National Assembly's" Convening Signifies Marshall's Final Failure.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 28th: According to a United Press report from New York on December 12th: *National Weekly* on the 12th demanded that Truman announce the immediate withdrawal of all American troops stationed in China, and order the cessation of all current economic and military aid. No further aid should be given to Chiang until Truman's policy statement on China from last year is implemented. The journal also stated: The convening of the Nanjing National Assembly signifies the final failure of Marshall's mission, and the situation is deteriorating. Because the Kuomintang believes that the United States is helping Chiang suppress the Communists, only swift and extraordinary measures from the American side can overturn this belief and prevent the tragic trend from occurring.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 28th: According to an Associated Press report from Monterey, California on December 14th: The Pacific Society's Canadian representatives held a meeting on the 14th to discuss Chinese political and economic issues. Gilchrist, the former director of the UNRRA China Office, gave a speech stating: The Chinese government's continued maintenance of a large army will lead to endless bloodshed, bringing the entire country to the brink of bankruptcy. Harry Bridges, editor of the ILWU newspaper, declared: We should order American troops to withdraw from China, because China is not an enemy country. American troops in China are only assisting one side to fight against the other. Bridges refuted the American Federation of Labor representative Rudan's statement, saying: It is not to ask American workers to approve of communism, but American workers know that what the Communist Party in China is preparing to do for the Chinese people is indeed more than what the government is doing.

　　《民族周刊》要求杜鲁门
    立即撤退驻华美军
    并称：“国大”的举行表示马歇尔已告最后失败。
    【新华社延安十二月二十八日电】据合众社纽约十二月十二日电：民族周刊十二日要求杜鲁门宣布立即撤回全体驻华美军，并下令停止目前之一切经济及军事援助。在实现去年杜鲁门对华政策声明前，决不继续援蒋。该周刊又称：南京国民大会之举行，表示马歇尔之使命已告最后失败，且情势每况愈下。因国民党相信美国正在助蒋抑共，只有美国方面采取迅速之非常手段，才能推翻此种信念，而阻止发生悲剧之趋势。
    【新华社延安十二月二十八日电】据美联社加利福尼亚州蒙德莱城十二月十四日电：太平洋学会加拿大代表于十四日举行会议讨论中国政治及经济问题，联总前中国分署署长吉塞发表演说称：中国政府继续维持中国之大军，行将流血不已，使全国濒于破产。产业工会联合会码头工人报主笔华生宣称：我们应令美军退出中国，因中国并非敌国。美军在华仅协助甲方以抗乙方而已。华氏反驳美国劳工联合会之代表鲁丹尔称：非请美国工人赞成共产主义，但美国工人晓得，共产党在中国准备为中国人民所做的事，实在较政府为多。
