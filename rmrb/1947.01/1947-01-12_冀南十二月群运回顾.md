　　Review of the Hebei-South December Mass Movement
    Ji Nan Branch
    In Hebei-South Old Liberated Area, the rent reduction and anti-usury movement has become widespread to every corner this month. During the eight-year war of resistance, the old liberated areas carried out rent reduction and interest rate cuts, but this inspection and reduction is to completely eliminate feudal exploitation. Yuancheng, Jize, Qinghe, Guanxian, Qiuxian, Renxian, Longping and other places have completely completed land reform. The feudal forces that had been left out in the past struggles and continued to rule the masses have been completely defeated by the peasants. Due to the attention and depth of leadership, backward villages and blank villages have been completely eliminated. The vast number of peasants have obtained land and means of production, laying the foundation for future development of production. Other old liberated areas in more than a dozen counties have also begun to carry out inspection and reduction, implementing the land reform movement of "land to the tiller."

    Reports from various places fully prove that taking the mass line and promoting democracy are the fundamental key to fully mobilizing the masses. In Nanwu, Longping, because democracy was promoted, the fruits were distributed quickly and fairly, and the masses were very satisfied. In Nanliyi, Yaoshan, because the village cadres took over everything, the fruits were not handled well, and the masses were opposed to it. Village cadres in the fourth district of Nanhe changed their monopolistic style, and the masses said, "The village cadres have changed, we must turn over and liberate ourselves." In the fourth district of Daming, because the district cadres took over everything and did not cultivate mass leaders, the masses asked the cadres about everything, which made the cadres caught up in busy affairs. All this fully proves that if village cadres and mass leaders do not take the mass line and do not have a democratic style, the masses cannot be thoroughly mobilized. We must be clear that due to thousands of years of feudal rule, the peasants do not have the habit of democratic life. If we do not carry out democratic education in a timely and in-depth manner and establish a democratic system, even if land reform is completed, the peasants' awareness will not be high enough, and they will still not be able to unite into an invincible force.

    According to the reports in January, valuable experience has also been gained in carrying out the women's movement. In Jixian, the women's movement has been vigorously developed due to the leadership's liquidation of the views of "stage theory" and "women's independent movement." In fact, it proves that the most urgent demand of the vast number of working women is to get rid of their economic poverty, followed by the shackles of old feudal ethics. In the inspection movement in Ningnan, women, together with the peasants, liquidated the remaining landlords and despots who were not completely defeated. Because they could get economic benefits, they greatly increased the enthusiasm of women. In less than a few days, more than 15,000 women from more than 40 villages in the county participated in the struggle. Facts have proved that the women's movement must start from carrying out the class-based anti-feudal struggle. This not only solves their economic difficulties, but also improves their status, exercises their abilities, and cultivates their leaders. The viewpoint of starting from "anti-abuse, mother-in-law in charge of dressing, and freedom of marriage" is wrong.

    After the land reform, the land has returned to the peasants, and the vast number of peasants are carrying out winter production with unparalleled enthusiasm. Some landlords who returned land to the peasants are also actively producing and establishing their families. After the inspection and liquidation of landlord Ma Xiangyun in Shanyue Village, Yuancheng, he gradually realized the wrongness of parasitic life, personally participated in labor, and organized mutual aid groups with his neighbors. Sun ×yuan, a large landlord in Dage Village, Hengshui, actively participated in production after liquidation, quit his habit of smoking opium, and kept saying to the peasants, "I not only don't hate you, but I am very grateful to you." From these facts, it is proved that many landlords have liquidated feudal exploitation, and also liquidated the idea of exploitation and parasitism, taking pride in participating in labor, and realizing that engaging in production with the peasants is the most glorious way to get rich.

    This month, Enxian County, Yongzhi, Wucheng, Ningnan and other counties carried out in-depth re-examination and consolidation work. Enxian's sixth and third districts found many problems in the re-examination. In Xingjiazhuang district, one village had a fake struggle against a landlord family, the masses outside the peasant association in two villages did not get any fruits, militiamen in two villages got particularly many fruits, the directors of the peasant associations in five villages had a coercive command style, other villages had fruits that had not been distributed, some had embezzled and wasted, and some backward members were afraid of "the change of dynasty" and secretly communicated with the families being struggled against. Based on these problems, solidarity meetings, thinking meetings, and inspection meetings were generally held in various places. In Ningnan Nandingcao, the inspection meeting lasted for a day and a night. After some cadres reflected on the phenomena of monopolization, favoritism, embezzlement, and corruption, they stipulated a democratic system. The masses in Dongwang held a reflection meeting, and some masses reflected on the idea of "willing to struggle and eat, but not willing to produce." In Enxian Tanzhuang, backward members were criticized and educated. Under the frenzy of victory, the masses in Ningnan generally held thinking meetings, and the masses' awareness was unprecedentedly improved. When the masses in Dongwang discussed how to protect the fruits, 170 young adults joined the militia. Five members of the peasant association in × village joined the Communist Party and took pride in it. The above facts fully prove that after the great development stage of the mass movement has passed, there will inevitably be many omissions, especially the need to establish a democratic style for peasant leaders, and the need to transform the thinking of the vast number of peasants. We must deepen this work in order to thoroughly solve the land problem, achieve the iron unity of the majority of peasants, eliminate any gap that feudal forces can take advantage of, and establish the absolute advantage of the people. However, the re-examination and consolidation work is not universal and in-depth enough in various counties, and it must be greatly carried out in the future. Some counties have turned to joining the army and preparing for war in order to meet Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Therefore, how to combine joining the army and preparing for war with re-examination and consolidation work should be specifically discussed. After the re-examination, Enxian's sixth district carried out a major peasant election, and the peasants enthusiastically elected Gao Fengkui as their leader, and shouted, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, follow Gao Fengkui." This is a great achievement in the district. Gao Fengkui is a very honest peasant. Like other peasants, he was subjected to cruel oppression. After being cultivated by the leadership, he wholeheartedly served the masses and led the vast number of peasants to fight against feudal forces.

　　冀南十二月群运回顾
    冀南分社
    冀南老区的查减运动，在这一月内，已普遍到每个角落。八年抗战中，老区进行过减租减息，而这次查减，是彻底消灭封建剥削。元朝、鸡泽、清河、冠县、邱县、任县、隆平等，已彻底完成土地改革。过去斗争中遗漏下继续统治群众的封建势力，已彻底为农民打垮。由于领导上的注意与深入，落后村与空白村已完全扫除，广大农民获得土地和生产工具，打下今后发展生产的基础，其他十余县的老区，亦已开始进行查减，贯彻耕者有其田的土地改革运动。
    从各地报导中完全证明：走群众路线，发扬民主是充分发动群众的根本关键。隆平南吴因为发扬了民主，果实分得又快又公平，群众很满意。尧山南礼义因为村干部包办，果实处理的不好，遭到群众的反对。南和四区区村干部转变了包办作风，群众便说：“村干改样了，得好好闹翻身”。大名四区由于区干包办，没培养出群众领袖，群众有事就问干部，使干部陷于繁忙的事务中，这都充分证明村干及群众领袖若不走群众路线，没有民主作风，群众便不可能彻底发动起来。我们必须明确由于数千年的封建统治，农民没有民主生活习惯，若不及时深入进行民主教育，建立民主制度，虽然完成土地改革，但农民觉悟提高不够，仍不能团结成为不可战胜的力量。
    根据一月的报导，开展妇女运动，也获得了宝贵的经验。冀县由于领导上清算“阶段论”和“妇女独立运动”的观点，妇运得以猛烈开展。实际上证明了广大劳动妇女的最迫切要求是解除其经济上的贫困，其次才是封建旧礼教的束缚，宁南在检查运动中，妇女与农民一道清算遗留的与打垮不彻底的地主恶霸，因为能得到经济利益大大提高了妇女热情，不到几天工夫，全县四十多个村庄，有万五千余妇女参加斗争。事实证明了妇女运动，必须从进行阶级性的反封建斗争上入手，这样不但解决了其经济困难，还可以提高其地位，锻炼其能力，培养其领袖。从“反虐待，婆婆管穿，婚姻自由”，入手的观点是不对的。
    经过土地改革，土地回了老家，广大农民正以无比的热忱开展冬季生产。有些地主退还农民土地后，也在积极生产，建立家务。元朝山岳村地主马相云查减清算后，逐渐认识了寄生生活的不对，亲手参加劳动，并和邻居组织了互助组。衡水大葛村大地主孙×元，清算后，积极参加生产，戒除了吸白面的嗜好，不断对农民说：“我不但不恨你们，倒很感谢你们”。从这些事实中证明有许多地主清算了封建剥削，也清算了剥削寄生的思想，以参加劳动为荣，并认识了和农民一道从事生产，可以发家致富，是最光荣的道路。
    这一个月区新恩县、永智、武城、宁南等县深入进行了翻身大检查和巩固工作。恩县六、三区从大检查中发现了很多问题。邢家庄小区有一个村对一户地主是假斗争，两个村农会以外的群众没有分到果产，两个村民兵分果实特别多，五个村农会主任有强迫命令作风，其他村有果实尚未分配的，有贪污浪费的，有的落后会员怕“变天”，暗中与被斗户通气。根据这些问题，各地普遍召开了团结会、想想会、检查会。宁南南丁曹检查会开了一天一夜，有些干部反省出包办、情面、贪污、腐化现象后，规定了民主制度。东汪群众召开了反省会，有的群众反省出“愿告斗争吃饭不愿生产”的思想。恩县谭庄对落后会员，进行了批评教育。宁南群众在胜利的狂欢下，普遍召开了想想会，群众觉悟空前提高。东汪群众讨论怎样保卫果实时，有一百七十个青壮年参加民兵。×庄有五个农会员参加共产党、并以此为荣。由以上事实充分证明，群众运动大发展阶段过去后，必然会有很多遗漏问题，特别是农民领袖民主作风需要建立，广大农民的思想需要改造，必须深入这个工作，才能把土地问题解决的彻底，才能作到农民大多数铁的团结，杜绝封建势力任何可乘之隙，树立人民绝对的优势。不过翻身大检查和巩固工作在各县还不够普遍与深入，在今后还须大大开展。有些县份为迎击蒋介石的进攻，转入了参军备战，因此如何结合参军备战，进行翻身大检查和巩固工作，应作具体的讨论。恩县六区在翻身大检查后，进行了农民大选举，农民热烈的选举高凤魁为自己的领袖，并呼出：“在共产党的领导下，跟着高凤魁走”，这是该区一个伟大的成就。高凤魁是一个很老实农民的，他和其他农民一样受着残酷的压榨，经过领导上的培养，他便赤心为群众办事，领导广大农民向封建势力斗争。
