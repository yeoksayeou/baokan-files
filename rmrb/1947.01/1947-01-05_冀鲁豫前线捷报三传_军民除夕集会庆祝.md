　　Jilu-Yu Front Transmits Three Success Reports:
    Army and People Celebrate at New Year's Eve Gathering
    [This newspaper's front line correspondent team, 1st dispatch] On New Year's Eve, the Jilu-Yu front held a New Year's celebration opera evening party. The military region's cultural troupe and a certain unit's cultural team jointly performed programs such as "Digging Fortifications," "Wang Keqin Class" (six-scene opera), "Ode to Snow" (Chairman Mao's poem), and "Army and People as One Family," etc. Before the evening party, there was also an exhibition by the People's Pictorial Publishing House and the cultural troupe's art group, with dozens of huge color cloth paintings recording the Five Battles and Five Victories, as well as hundreds of cartoons and photographs. Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang, and Chief of Staff Li all rode to visit, and the army and people who came to visit were extremely crowded. Commander Liu especially praised the huge cloth paintings, and in an excited tone, he praised "Battle of Juan'nan" (a color cloth painting three feet wide and five feet high), saying, "Painted so well, thrilling!" A thirty-year-old emancipated farmer from the village stared at the large painting "Ladder Team," recalling when the Eighth Route Army liberated their county town from the enemy and puppet forces, the "Ladder Team" advanced so heroically. The photographs were also welcomed by the masses. Below the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the photographs of Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng inspecting their ever-victorious army, were howitzers, tanks, and various light and heavy weapons, as well as photographs of surrendered Jiang's army generals Zhao Xitian, Liu Guangxin, Huang Zhengcheng, Yang Xianming, and others. The battle scenes of the Wang Keqin Class and the little hero Lü Dengke were also presented before the people. Unit cadres automatically explained to the masses. The evening party was even more lively, with three successive reports of victory, reporting the victory of recovering Juye, liberating Liaocheng, and besieging Jinxiang. Every time a report of victory came, the venue resounded with slogans such as "Fight a victorious battle and celebrate the New Year!"

    军民除夕集会庆祝
    【本报前线记者团一日电】除夕之夜，冀鲁豫前线举行新年祝捷歌剧晚会，由军区文工团与某部文工队结合演出，节目为“挖工事”、“王克勤班”（六场歌剧）、“咏雪”（毛主席诗）与“军民一家”等。晚会前并有人民画报社与文工团美术组展览，十数幅记载五战五捷的巨幅彩色布画，还有几百张漫画与照片。刘司令员、邓政委、张副政委、李参谋长均驰马前往参观，军民参观者拥挤不堪。刘司令员特别称赞巨幅布画，他以兴奋的口吻赞赏“鄄南之战”（宽三尺高五尺的彩色布画）说：“画得真好，惊心动魄”。一位三十来岁的本村翻身农民，则注目“梯子组”大画，回忆八路军从敌伪手中解放他们的县城时，“梯子组”就是这样英勇前进的。照片也受到群众的欢迎，在毛主席、朱总司令肖像及刘司令员、邓政委检阅其常胜军的照片下，是榴弹炮、坦克及各种轻重武器，放下武器蒋军将官赵锡田、刘广信、黄正成、杨显明等的照片。王克勤班战斗场面及小英雄吕登科，也呈现在人们眼前。部队干部都自动向群众解说。晚会中更加热闹，连续传来三次捷报，报告收复巨野、解放聊城、围攻金乡的胜利，每一次捷报传来，会场都响起“打胜仗过新年”等口号。
