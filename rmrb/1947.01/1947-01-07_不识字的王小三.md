    Illiterate Wang Xiaosan
    Liu Le
    In our village, there's a Wang Xiaosan,
    Who runs a general store stall in the street;
    Just because he's an illiterate blind man,
    His accounting and debt-collecting are a rare mess;
    Someone bought five eggs from him,
    So he drew five circles in his ledger;
    Later, when the person paid the debt,
    He drew a line through the circles;
    When it came time for him to collect debts at the end of the year,
    He insisted that the person owed him money for a string of candied haws.

    不识字的王小三
    刘勒
    俺村里有个王小三，
    在街上摆着个杂货摊；
    只因他睁眼瞎子不识字，
    记账要账净闹稀罕；
    有人买了他五个鸡蛋，
    他就在账本上划了五个圈；
    后来人家还了账，
    他就在圈上拉了一条线；
    到了年底他又要账，
    硬说人家欠他一串糖葫芦钱。
