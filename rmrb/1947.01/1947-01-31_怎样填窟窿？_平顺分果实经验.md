How to Fill the Hole?
——The Experience of Distributing Fruits in a Fair Manner in Pingshun
Wang Julin

In the fill-the-gap and make-even movement, an important question in distributing the fruits is how to fill the hole? To enable the poor peasants who have not yet been emancipated to obtain land, and also to take care of and unite 90% of the peasants. In Pingshun, during the process of filling the hole, there were different disputes due to the different requirements of the new and old middle peasants, cadres, and hole-households within the peasantry. We paid special attention to mastering the links of distribution according to needs, democratic discussion, and ideological education, overcoming some ideas of excluding middle peasants, and consolidating the internal unity of the peasantry.

(1) The distribution of fruits should grasp the principle of filling the hole, focus on distribution, and take care of the general. Land, houses, and livestock should first go to the hole-households, and the rest should be taken care of all the peasants. Cadres and the masses are the same. Poor households get more, and wealthy households get less.

Many villages have implemented the method of supplementing what is lacking and distributing according to needs, clarifying to the masses that the distribution of fruits is to fill the hole and realize "the tiller has his land." In terms of distribution steps, first fill the holes of poor military families, cadre families, and extremely poor peasants, so that they all get enough land, houses, livestock, and grain. The remaining middle peasants also received small supplements.

The standard for hole-households: Many villages calculate based on population and grain production. Those who consume less than seven shi of grain per person per year are considered hole-households and supplemented to be even. Except for the hole-households, the rest of the village is divided into three grades according to the quality of the land and the amount of production for adjustment.

In the implementation of the one-time filling-the-hole movement, pay attention to taking care of the emancipation of poor and rich villages. Caozhuang Gou in the first district lacks land and suffered from wind disasters last year, and half of the households do not have enough to eat. Changgou and other mountain villages in the seventh district do not have enough land to cultivate. We conducted education on "Peasants all over the world are one family, and rich villages help poor villages to be emancipated." After opening up the minds of the masses, Chongyan Village in the first district sent 14.2 mu of land to Beiliutan; Heihu Village in the seventh district sent 20 mu of land to Changgou; Lujiakou and other ten villages sent 194 shi of grain to Caozhuang Gou. Guangwu Village in the fifth district, after carrying out comprehensive fill-the-hole and emancipation education, left 60 mu of good land to prepare to help immigrants from other villages to be emancipated.

(2) Democratic discussion:

In order to achieve fairness and rationality in the distribution of fruits, it is necessary to promote democracy and eliminate internal differences of opinion among peasants through mass discussions.

In Nanzhuang Gou in the sixth district, first, the hole-households reported what they lacked, and then selected evaluation committee members to conduct discussions and evaluations. Divide the hole-households, masses, cadres, and evaluators into three groups, evaluate separately, and then the three parties come together to re-evaluate, concentrate on the opinions of all parties to divide the grades, and decide after repeated revisions by the masses. The masses are relatively satisfied with this method. After the three parties in Liuhuyao Village discussed the results and came together to make a comprehensive decision, the eyes of the masses were the most accurate, and everyone was very happy.

Another method: The cadres first investigate what the masses lack, grasp the spirit of giving more to the poor military families and hole-households, determine the number according to the needs of the masses, and then let the masses discuss and approve it. This method requires village cadres to be familiar with the concerns of the masses and be able to meet the needs of the masses based on existing materials. For example, the cadres in Shannan conducted an in-depth investigation of the needs of the masses and distributed cypress boards to the old man Shen Mingfeng, who was very happy. After the investigation and discussion of more than 250 households in the village, everyone was satisfied with the land and grain they deserved.

However, if we want to eliminate internal differences of opinion among peasants in the process of distributing fruits, in addition to fully promoting democracy, handing over the right to propose and the right to decide to the masses, and letting the masses make their own decisions, it is also necessary to strengthen the ideological education of the masses, carry out internal democratic struggle, and conduct democratic centralization education.

(3) Ideological Education:

After cutting off the feudal tails, the eyes of the peasants are focused on the distribution of fruits, and the thoughts of the masses are very complicated. As Shi Taoqi, the political director of Longyugou, said: "At this time, the masses have one heart and one mind. If ideological education is not grasped tightly, it will affect the unity of the peasants. In the distribution of fruits, we found that there is antagonistic emotions in the minds of the new and old emancipated households: the hole-households are dissatisfied with the old village cadres, they want everything, and everything is a hole, and they want to get everything done at once; the old emancipated households want to try their best to become hole-households, trying to grab the fruits. Doukou Village fought out forty cabinets, and the masses reported more than two hundred. In this way, it is necessary to educate the masses to understand the significance of filling the hole and everyone being emancipated. "Heihu Village proposed: "There are many people and few things, what should we do?" Let everyone discuss it. The result was unanimous: "It's useless to argue for a year, we must always look at the size of the hole," "It's not good to fill the gap if there is no hole, and we can't just think about what's right for ourselves." Many people did not argue. Shannandi proposed: "It's not enough to eat if you argue, you can't finish it if you give in," "Whoever should have it will eat it even if you run to the hillside, and whoever shouldn't have it won't eat it even if you are by the pot."

In the distribution of furniture and materials, the contradiction between the general new and old middle peasants and the hole-households is easy to form an opposition. When Hongtiguan distributed furniture and clothes, some middle peasants reflected: "The hole-households have already gotten the houses, land and grain, and they should not be distributed other furniture." They advocated equal distribution. However, another part of the poor peasants and hole-households in power had an exclusionary psychology towards the middle and poor peasants. For example, Wuqu priced the furniture distributed to the middle peasants particularly high. When Shannandi distributed furniture, the middle peasants quarreled, which worried the evaluation committee. According to this situation, to the first type of people, we proposed: "Peasants all over the world are one family, and those who have been emancipated should help the poor brothers who have not been emancipated to be emancipated, and should not be divided equally." To the second type of people, we changed their thinking from "What does it take to get rich?" and proposed: "Fruits are capital, and getting rich depends on production," clarifying that as long as you have land, houses, and livestock, you can still earn some common furniture with your own labor.

After the distribution of fruits, we must also consider the opposing emotions of cadres and military families and emancipated households towards the newly emancipated hole-households, and their selfish psychology must be resolved through long-term education. After the distribution of fruits in Shibutou, we heard a few cadres and new middle peasants reflect: "After working for a winter, this year's fruits have all been taken away by the hole-households." We seized this problem and calculated the emancipation account in the civil school. For example, the cadre Shi Caishuan was divided into twelve mu of land in 1944, and after emancipation, he harvested more than twenty shi of grain, and had herds of mules and horses, with five heads of livestock. Shi Goutang calculated that the fruits he distributed in 1944 were worth sixty shi of millet. Putting the grain harvested over the years together, they were all stronger than the hole-households, and everyone no longer said that the hole-households got more fruits.

    怎样填窟窿？
    ——平顺分果实经验
    王巨林
    在填平补齐运动中，分配果实的重要问题是怎样填平窟窿？让没翻身的贫苦农民获得土地，又能照顾和团结百分之九十农民。平顺在填窟窿过程中由于农民内部新旧中农、干部和窟窿户的要求不同，曾引起不同争执。我们特别注意掌握了按需分配，民主讨论，和思想教育几个环节，克服了某些排斥中农的思想，巩固了农民内部团结。
    （一）分配果实要掌握填平窟窿原则，有重点的分配，并照顾一般。土地房屋牲口先尽窟窿户，其余照顾全体农民，干部和群众一样，贫户多得富裕户少得。
    许多村都实行了缺啥补啥、按需分配办法，在群众中明确分果实是为了填平窟窿实现耕者有其田。分配步骤上，先填贫苦军属干属赤贫农的窟窿，使他们都分得了足够的土地房屋牲口和粮食，其余中农也补了小补绽。
    窟窿户标准，有许多村是按人口、产粮计算，每人平均吃穿七石粮食，不足者即算窟窿户，予以补齐，全村除窟窿户外，其的中农分三等按土地好坏与生产数来作调剂。
    在实行一次填平运动中，注意照顾贫富村翻身问题，一区草庄沟土地缺少，去年又遭风灾，有一半户不够吃；七区长沟等山庄，地都不够种。我们进行了“天下农民是一家，富村帮助穷村翻身”的教育，打通了群众思想后，一区崇岩村送给北流滩地十四亩二分；七区黑虎村送给长沟地二十亩；路家口等十村送给草庄沟粮食一九四石。五区广武村，在进行全面填平翻身教育后，留出好地六十亩，准备帮助外村移民翻身。
    （二）民主讨论问题：
    在分配果实时为了作到公平合理，必须发扬民主，通过群众讨论，消除农民内部意见纷歧。
    六区南庄沟先由窟窿户缺啥报啥以后，选出评判委员进行讨论评议。把窟窿户、群众、干部与评判员分为三组，分头评议，然后三方面到一块复评，集中各方意见划分等级，通过群众反复修正后决定。这种方法，群众比较满意。六虎窑村经过三方面讨论结果，到一块综合决定时，群众的眼睛最准确，结果大家非常高兴。
    另一种办法：由干部首先调查群众缺啥东西，掌握贫苦军属、窟窿户多分精神，根据群众需要确定数目，再让群众讨论通过；这种方法，必须村干部对群众心事熟悉，能根据现有物资满足群众需要，如山南的干部深入调查群众需要，给老汉申明凤分到柏木板，他非常高兴。全村二百五十余户，经调查讨论结果，大家都满意的分到应得的土地和粮食。
    但是，要想在分配果实过程中消除农民内部意见纷歧，除了充分发扬民主，把提议权和决定权都交给群众，由群众自己作主以外，加强群众思想教育，开展内部民主斗争，进行民主集中教育，也是必要的。
    （三）思想教育问题：
    在割掉封建尾巴之后，农民目光都集中到果实分配上，群众思想很复杂。正如龙峪沟政治主任石桃气所说：“这时群众是一个人一条心，如果思想教育掌握不紧，会影响农民团结。在分果实中，我们发现新旧翻身户思想上存在着对抗情绪：窟窿户对旧村干不满，样样都想得，件件皆窟窿，想一次弄个齐备；老翻身户想尽量争取当窟窿户，企图争果实。豆口村斗出四十个柜，群众就报了二百多个。这样必须教育群众了解填窟窿大家翻身的意义。黑虎村提出：“人多东西少，怎么办？”让大家讨论，结果一致说：“争一年也没底，总得看窟窿大小，”“没窟窿补上补绽也不好看，不能光图自己合适。”许多人都不争了。山南底提出：“争争吵吵不够吃，尽尽让让吃不了，”“该谁要跑到山坡也吃上了，不该要在锅边也吃不上。”
    在分配家具物资问题上，一般新旧中农和窟窿户的矛盾容易形成对立，红梯关在分配家具衣服时，一部分中农反映：“窟窿户房地粮食都得到手了，别的家具不该再分了。”他们主张平均分配。但另一部当权贫农和窟窿户，却对中贫农存在着排斥心理。如五曲把分给中农那些家具作价特别高。山南底在分配家具时中农争吵起来，使评议会都发了愁。根据这种情况，对第一种人提出：“天下农民是一家，翻了身的应帮助没翻身的穷弟兄翻身，不应该一律均分。”对第二种人，则从“发家靠什么？”来转变他们的思想，提出：“果实是本钱，发家靠生产，”明确只要有了土地房屋牲口，一般家具少补些还可凭自己劳动挣来。
    在分果实工作结束后，我们还须估计到干部与军属翻身户对新翻身的窟窿户的对立情绪，对他们自私心理还得经过长期教育来解决。在石埠头分果实后，听到少数干部与新中农反映：“干一冬天，今年的果实都让窟窿户拿去了。”我们抓住这个问题，就在民校里算翻身账，如干部石才拴，四四年分了十二亩地，翻身后多打二十石粮食，骡马成群，有了五头牲口。石狗堂计算他四四年分配果实，能值六十石小米，把几年来打下粮食计算一块，都比窟窿户强，大家再不说窟窿户多得果实了。
