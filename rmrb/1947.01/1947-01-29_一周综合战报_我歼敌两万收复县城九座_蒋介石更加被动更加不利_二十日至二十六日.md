    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 27th: Weekly Comprehensive War Report (January 20th to 26th):
    The characteristic of this week's war situation lies in Chiang Kai-shek being even more passive and disadvantaged, and this weakness is most obvious in his current main battlefield – the Su, Lu, Yu, Ji, and Anhui region centered on Xuzhou. This unfavorable situation made Chen Cheng, one of the warmongering leaders sitting in Xuzhou, feel quite out of sorts about his "50th birthday celebration" and lament his "bitter fate" (see Central News Agency report).
    Within this week, nearly 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops invading the Liberated Areas were annihilated. Chiang's army occupied one county town (Yicheng), while the people recovered five (Wangdu, Xiaoyi, Guancheng, Dingtao, Nanle) (Editor's note: As of the 26th, the Ji-Lu-Yu region also recovered Qingfeng, Shanxian, and Caoxian county towns, and Taihang recovered Wenxian county town on the 22nd, making a total of nine.) as well as Zaozhuang, a well-known coal mining area and strong stronghold northeast of Xuzhou, and Wangjing, Zhaixidian and other stations on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway.
    After recovering Zaozhuang on the 20th, the East China People's Liberation Army has, in the 20 days of this year, recovered most of the Lunan area occupied by Chiang's army in violation of the January 13th ceasefire position, including more than 120 important towns such as Yixian, Pixian, and Lanling, regaining control of the Lin-Zao and Tai-Zao railways, capturing over 16,000 Chiang's army personnel below the rank of division commander Ma Liwu, Zhou Yuying, and Han Shiru, and killing or wounding over 13,000 others. At this point, the Lunan offensive organized by Chiang's army this time has been completely crushed. In order to save the increasingly serious defeat, Chiang Kai-shek is ordering Chen Cheng to gather forces in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway to organize a new offensive. New battles are underway. At the same time, the Chiang army Wang Yaowu's troops on the Jiaoji Railway are ordering Huo Shouyi and other troops to invade the Liberated Area around Laiwu in central Shandong from the Mingshui station area in the western section of the Jiaoji Railway as a response, but this route of Chiang's army has been resisted by the local military and civilians and has made no progress.
    The Chiang army invading Daming and other areas in southern Hebei and northeastern Henan is in an even more unfavorable position due to the recovery of Guancheng and Nanle (note that Qingfeng in the area has also been recovered).
    After recovering Dingtao on the 24th in southwestern Shandong, the Chiang's army in the area has been cut into two parts, east and west, by the large recovered area of Juye, Jiaxiang, Chengwu, and Dingtao. After Mi Wenhe, Liu Ruzhen, Zhang Lanfeng and other troops in the west of Heze and Caoxian (Caoxian has been liberated) lost more than 10,000 people in their eastward attack, the garrison force has become increasingly weakened. The 88th Division of Fang Xianjue and other troops of the Chiang's army in the Yutai and Jinxiang areas in the east are even more isolated.
    On the morning of the 18th, the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army liberated Xiaoyi city on the central Shanxi Plain, killing and capturing more than 1,600 Yan's troops. They are now fighting against a large number of Yan's troops invading the Xiaoyi and Fenyang areas, annihilating more than 6,000 of them. The fierce battle is still continuing.
    The Jin-Cha-Ji Eighth Route Army once again recovered Wangdu and Wangjing Station on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway on the 21st, capturing 1,000 troops of Hou Ruyong. Following that, on the 23rd, Zhaixidian Station south of Dingxian County was liberated. On the next day, the 95th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the Chiang's Third Army and the First Regiment of Hou Ruyong came to attack Zhaixidian, and were also completely annihilated.
    The Northeast Democratic Allied Army repelled the invading Chiang's army in Sidaojiang and other places north of Tonghua in Andong Province. In the counter-encroachment battles in Liuhe and Fushun, Liaoning Province, 34 large and small strongholds such as Gushanzi south of Liuhe and Taipingshao in Fushun County were recovered, killing and capturing more than 1,000 Chiang's army personnel.

    一周综合战报
    我歼敌两万收复县城九座
    蒋介石更加被动更加不利
    二十日至二十六日
    【新华社延安二十七日电】一周综合战报（二十日至二十六日）：
    本周战局的特点，在于蒋介石更加被动更加不利，而这个弱点在其目前主要战场上——以徐州为中心的苏鲁豫冀皖地区——最为明显。这一不利局势，使坐镇徐州的好战派头子之一陈诚，对于他的“五十大庆”也感到颇煞风景而自叹“命苦”（见中央社电）了。
    本周内侵入解放区之蒋军又被歼灭近两万人，蒋军侵占县城一座（翼城），而人民收复了五座（望都、孝义、观城、定陶、南乐）（编者按：迄二十六日止，冀鲁豫还收复了清丰、单县、曹县三座县城，太行于廿二日克复温县城，共是九座。）及徐州东北蒋军强固据点著名煤矿产地枣庄以及平汉北段之王京、寨西店等车站。
    鲁南前线二十日收复枣庄后，华东人民解放军在今年之廿天中，已将鲁南地区被蒋军违背一月十三日停战位置侵占去的大部地区收复，包括峄县、邳县、兰陵等重要城镇一百二十余处，重新掌握临枣、台枣铁路，共生俘蒋军师长马励武、周毓英、韩世儒以下一万六千余人，另毙伤其一万三千余人。至此，蒋军此次所组织的鲁南攻势已彻底被粉碎了。为了挽救日益严重的败局，蒋介石正命陈诚在陇海东段集结力量，组织新的攻势，新的战事正在进行中。同时胶济路上的蒋军王耀武部，正命霍守义等部从胶济西段明水车站一带南犯鲁中莱芜一带解放区以为策应，但此路蒋军已遭当地军民抗击，无何进展。
    侵入冀南、豫东北地区大名等地之蒋军，由于观城、南乐之收复（按该地区之清丰亦已收复），处于更加不利地位。
    鲁西南至二十四日收复定陶后，该地蒋军已被巨野、嘉祥、城武、定陶这一大片收复区割裂成东西两块，西面荷泽、曹县（按曹县已光复）等地自米文和、刘汝珍、张岚峰等部东犯损失万余人后，守备力量益趋薄弱，东面鱼台、金乡地区蒋军八十八师方先觉等部更形孤立。
    晋绥八路军于十八日晨解放晋中平原上的孝义城，毙俘阎军一千六百余人，现正在孝义、汾阳地区迎击来犯之大量阎军，再歼其六千余人，激战尚在继续中。
    晋察冀八路军，于平汉北段二十一日再度收复望都及王京车站，生俘侯如墉部千人，继于二十三日解放定县南之寨西店车站，次日蒋军第三军三十二师九十五团及侯如墉部第一团来犯寨西店，亦已全部就歼。
    东北民主联军在安东省通化北之四道江等处，击退进犯的蒋军，另在柳河及辽宁省抚顺一带反蚕食战中，收复柳河南之孤山子及抚顺县属之太平哨等大小据点三十四处，共毙俘蒋军千余人。
