　　[Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th dispatch] Our military reporter reported the detailed process of the large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle of the East China Field Army of the New Fourth Army in Subei (Northern Jiangsu) and Shushu (Suqian and Shuyang) as follows: Chiang Kai-shek's goal in this northward offensive was to seize Xinan Town in the north and Shuyang City in the east, cut off the connection between the Jiangsu-Shandong liberated areas, and then eliminate the main force of the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu in one fell swoop, driving them out of northern Jiangsu; he fantasized that this would end the civil war in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, he ordered Wu Qiwai, deputy director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, to establish an advance command post in Suqian, and rushed all three brigades of the reorganized 11th Division (formerly the 18th Army), namely the 11th, 18th, and 118th, known as one of the five main forces, to Suqian overnight. He also ordered the 60th Brigade of the reorganized 69th Division to hand over the defense of Suqian to the First Army's Second Division of the traitor Sun Liangcheng's forces and then assemble for orders. He also supplemented the division with a regiment of the remnants of the 92nd Brigade, and transferred the 3rd Provisional Brigade of Duan Linmao's 57th Division and the 41st Brigade of Ma Liwu's 26th Division, all under the command of Dai Ziqi, commander of the 69th Division, plus the 15th Engineer Regiment directly under the Nanjing Kuomintang Military Commission, totaling about seven brigades, under the unified command of Hu Lian, commander of the reorganized 11th Division, as the front-line commander. On the 13th of this month, they launched a five-pronged attack on Shuyang from Suqian and Zaohe Town, northwest of Suqian. On the 14th, the Chiang troops, with the 118th Brigade of the reorganized 11th Division, attacked along the Su-Shu Highway directly to the area of ​​Lailongdian. The headquarters of the 69th Division and a regiment of the 92nd Brigade invaded Renhewei to the northeast. The 41st Brigade, via Zhangshan Town on the Su(qian)-Xin(an Town) Road, invaded Shaodian Town on the bank of the Shu River to the northeast. The 60th Brigade also invaded Anrenji and Yewei (west of Shaodian on the bank of the Shu River) from Zhangshan Town to the northeast. The 3rd Provisional Brigade also invaded Xiaodianzi at the same time. After the Chiang troops penetrated deeply, the New Fourth Army immediately launched a planned counterattack in the evening, recovering Lailongdian that night and wiping out part of the 118th Brigade of the Chiang troops. On the 15th, the New Fourth Army launched a full-scale counterattack. A crack unit detoured to Jiuer Tou, more than ten *li* north of Suqian, cutting off the Chiang troops' retreat route and annihilating an engineering battalion and part of the artillery of the 11th Division. At this time, the cunning 11th Division retreated in a hurry, narrowly escaping complete annihilation. By this time, the Chiang troops had shown signs of overall collapse. Under the order of the commander-in-chief to retreat across the board, the 41st Brigade, which had occupied Shaodian, hurriedly retreated thirty *li* along the original road to the Miaozhuang and Songying line north of Renhewei. The 60th Brigade, which had occupied Anrenji and Yewei, also retreated along the original road to the Liuweizi and Luodian line several *li* east of Zhangshan Town. The 3rd Provisional Brigade still held Xiaodianzi and Zhangshan Town. The reorganized 11th Division withdrew from the encirclement of the New Fourth Army in a panic and confronted the New Fourth Army on the southern route. As a result, the Chiang troops, who originally occupied the vast plain of more than forty *li* between the Grand Canal and the Shu River, were tightly compressed by the New Fourth Army into a narrow area of less than twenty *li* in length and width, with vehicles, horses, guns, and cannons strewn all over the ground and sparse residents, creating favorable conditions for the annihilation of the besieged Chiang troops. At this time, the wise commanders of the New Fourth Army ordered their units to resolutely complete the task of annihilating the enemy. The New Fourth Army immediately completed the encirclement of the 69th Division in the area of ​​Zhangshan and Fengshan, twelve *li* east-west and eight *li* north-south. In the evening, they launched a general attack on the 9th Regiment of the 3rd Provisional Brigade, which was holding Fengshan, and by 9:00 am at dawn, they had completely annihilated the enemy, and Fengshan was captured. On the 16th, the Chiang troops again concentrated two regiments of the 69th Division to counterattack Fengshan, launching several fierce attacks, but were all annihilated on the front lines of the position. The remnants retreated back to the original location to the east. In the evening, the New Fourth Army launched a second general attack, annihilating a battalion of the remaining enemy entrenched in Zhangshan Town. After two days and nights of encirclement and annihilation, the Chiang troops collapsed across the board, fleeing east and west, but were never able to break through the iron wall of encirclement of the New Fourth Army. Under the high morale and popular support of the New Fourth Army soldiers launching an annihilation competition, the militiamen carrying stretcher teams and the hard-working cooks and animal husbandry workers vying to seize weapons, the 60th Brigade of the 69th Division was first annihilated, then they entered Xiaodianzi and annihilated the entire 3rd Provisional Brigade, and the 41st Brigade trapped in Miaozhuang and other places also suffered the same fate. At this point, the New Fourth Army launched a general attack on the headquarters of the 699th Division and the 276th Regiment Special Service Battalion of the 92nd Brigade, which were trapped in Renhewei. By the evening of the 18th, all the Chiang troops in the area were annihilated. At the same time, another large army quickly pursued and resolved the remaining Chiang troops fleeing west from Renhewei, Miaozhuang, Lizhuang, and Liwei. By the evening of the 19th, the entire battle ended in another victory.

　　铁壁之围
    ……原占运河沭河间辽阔平原地区的蒋军，紧紧的被压缩到纵横不到二十里的狭窄地区，满地都是车马枪炮……。经过两昼夜的围歼，蒋军全线溃乱，东奔西窜，但始终突不出新四军的铁壁之围。……
    【新华社华中廿五日电】本社军事记者报导苏北宿沭新四军华东野战军大围歼战经过详情如下：蒋介石此次向北线进攻，目标在于北取新安镇，东占沭阳城，切断苏鲁两解放区联系，再一举消灭苏北新四军主力，将其驱逐出苏北；幻想如此即可结束苏北内战。因而命令其徐州绥靖公署副主任吴奇伟于宿迁设立前进指挥所，将进犯冀鲁豫解放区的号称五大主力之一的整编十一师（原十八军）所属之十一、十八、一一八等三个旅全部星夜赶运宿迁，又叫整编六九师之六○旅将宿迁防务交给孙逆良诚部之第一军第二师后集结待命，并拨补该师以九二旅残部一个团，复将五七师段霖茂部之预三旅，廿六师马励武部之四一旅，均归六九师师长戴之奇指挥，另加一个南京国民党军委会直辖之工兵十五团，共约七个旅之兵力，以整十一师师长胡琏为前线指挥官，统率上述各部，于本月十三日分由宿迁及宿迁西北之皂河镇等地向沭阳五路进犯。十四日蒋军以整十一师一一八旅沿宿沭公路直扑来龙店一线，六九师师部与九二旅一个团向东北侵占人和圩，四一旅由宿（迁）新（安镇）路经嶂山镇向东北侵占沭河边之邵店镇，六○旅亦由嶂山镇向东北侵占安仁集、叶圩（在沭河边邵店以西），预三旅也同时侵占晓店子。新四军待蒋军深入后，入晚即实行有计划的反击，当晚收复来龙店，并歼俘蒋军一一八旅一部。十五日，新四军展开全面反击，某部劲旅迂回至宿迁以北十余里之九儿头，切断蒋军退路，并歼灭十一师之一个工兵营及炮兵一部。此时，狡猾的十一师以跑步缩退回去，幸免全军覆没。至此，蒋军已呈全线动摇，他们在总指挥一声命令全线后退下，侵占邵店之四一旅急忙向来路倒退三十里，至人和圩以北苗庄、宋营一线，侵占安仁集、叶圩之六十旅亦向来路退缩至嶂山镇以东数里的刘圩子、罗店一线，预三旅则仍据守晓店子、嶂山镇一线，整十一师就仓皇退出新四军包围圈外，与南路新四军对峙。于是，原占运河沭河间辽阔的平原上纵横四十余里之地区的蒋军，紧紧的被新四军压缩到纵横不到二十里的狭窄地区，满地都是车马枪炮，居民稀疏，造成聚歼被围蒋军的良好条件。此时，新四军英明的指挥者命令所部要坚决完成歼敌任务，新四军部队当即完成对据守嶂山、烽山等地东西十二里南北八里地区内之六九师之包围。入晚，总攻固守烽山之预三旅九团，至拂晓九时，将该敌完全歼灭，烽山即被攻克。十六日，蒋军复集中六九师二个团反攻烽山，数次猛扑，均被歼灭于阵地前沿。其残部又向东原地退去。至晚，新四军发动二次总攻，歼灭固守嶂山镇之残敌一个营。经二昼夜的围歼，蒋军全线溃乱，东奔西窜，但始终突不出新四军的铁壁之围；在新四军健儿掀起歼敌比赛、民兵担架队员与辛劳的炊事、饲养工作员都争相缴械的高昂士气与民心鼓舞下，首歼六九师六十旅，再入晓店子，将预三旅全部就歼，困守苗庄等地之四一旅亦同归覆没。至此，新四军又向困守人和圩之六九九师师部及九二旅二七六团特务营等部总攻，至十八日晚将该地蒋军全部歼灭。同时，另一部大军又迅速追击，解决由人和圩、苗庄、李庄、李圩向西逃窜之各路残余蒋军，至十九日傍晚，全线战事再告胜利结束。
