　　Cultivate More People's Meritorious Servants
    The Seventh Prefectural Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Decides to Launch the Zhao Letian Movement
    [Reported by our Hebei-Shandong-Henan correspondent on the 20th] The Seventh Prefectural Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan recently decided at the County Party Secretaries' Joint Conference to launch the Zhao Letian Movement and establish a work model for the mass line leadership method. It believes that this method of praising models and establishing typical examples is a good way to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres, and provides a good example for leadership methods. Zhao Letian, the work model of Anshan Town, led 63 people to join the army this time. The reason why so many people followed him is that he always does good things for the people, he knows how to follow the mass line, he has a very close relationship with the masses, and his exemplary actions are a good example of overcoming bureaucracy. Based on this spirit, the meeting studied and decided to cultivate more Zhao Letians and more people's meritorious servants.

    冀鲁豫七地委决定
    开展赵乐天运动
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】冀鲁豫七地委日前在县书联席会上，决定展开赵乐天运动，树立群众路线领导方法的工作模范，认为这种表扬模范树立典型，是发扬干部积极性创造性的好办法，给领导方法找到了好的典范。安山镇的工作模范赵乐天，这次带领了六十三人参军。这样多群众跟随他的原因，是他平时时时刻刻为老百姓办好事，他会走群众路线，他和群众有很密切的联系，他的模范行动是克服官僚主义的好榜样。根据这种精神，在会议上研究决定培养更多的赵乐天，培养更多的人民功臣。
