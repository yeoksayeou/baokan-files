　　Prevent Waste, Maintain Enthusiasm
    The Spring Festival (Lunar New Year) is approaching. Based on my experience last year, the mass movement during the Spring Festival is prone to the following deviations. Therefore, I put them forward for your reference:
    First, prevent the abuse of the fruits of struggle during the New Year. There are three situations here: (1) Local bullies and evil gentry often take advantage of the New Year to eat and use the property that should be returned to the masses on a large scale, and then falsely cry poverty to deny the masses. For this situation, each village should put forward the slogan of completely turning over before the New Year, and must let the local bullies and evil gentry hand over all the property that should be returned to the masses before the New Year, so as to avoid abuse. (2) Some village cadres and activists are prone to abuse the undistributed fruits, buying firecrackers, cigarettes, and even alcohol and meat for indiscriminate eating and use. For this phenomenon, on the one hand, we must educate activists to consider the interests of the masses; on the other hand, we must educate the masses to supervise at all times, so that they do not become detached from the masses. In leadership, when dealing with this issue, special attention should be paid to preventing the opposition between the masses and the cadres, so as not to give illegal landlords the opportunity to disintegrate the masses. (3) Some masses, after dividing the fruits of struggle, eat and drink heavily during the New Year, having rice for one meal and burning firewood for one session. For this phenomenon, the main thing is to educate the masses, explaining that the fruits of struggle are the blood and sweat that they were exploited by the landlords, and it is not easy to obtain them. They should cherish them and use them for production and wealth creation.
    Second, maintain the enthusiasm of the struggle and consolidate mass organizations. The masses and cadres in some villages may think that they have been struggling tensely for a year, and the Spring Festival should be a time to rest. In this way, they will relax, and mass organizations will become lax. Landlords and evil gentry can take this opportunity to either gain a respite to plot a counterattack, or use petty favors to soften cadres, making the turning-over movement fall by the wayside. On this issue, the main thing is to carry out in-depth class education among cadres and the masses, and to strengthen organization, such as holding "thinking sessions" during the New Year to reflect on turning-over thoughts. Holding mass oaths to strengthen determination is also very necessary.

### 防止浪费、保持热气

　　防止浪费、保持热气
    春节（旧历年关）快到了，依据我去年的经验，春节中的群运，最易产生下列偏向，故提出来，供各地参考：
    第一、是防止年关滥用斗争果实。这里面有三种情况：（一）恶霸地主常常利用年关机会，把应交还群众的财产，大肆吃用，然后假哭穷来抵赖群众。对这种情况，各村应事先提出翻身翻彻底的口号，一定要于年前让恶霸地主把应交还群众的财物全部交出，以免滥用。（二）有些村庄的干部及积极分子，容易滥用未分完的果实，买些纸炮啦，纸烟啦，甚至酒呀肉呀的乱吃乱用。对这种现象，一方面要教育积极分子为群众利益着想；另方面要教育群众随时监督，使他们不要脱离群众。在领导上，在处理这一问题时，特别要注意防止群众与干部的对立而给非法地主以瓦解群众的机会。（三）是有些群众分得了斗争果实后，在年关中大吃大喝，有米一顿，有柴一烘。对这种现象，主要是教育群众，说明斗争果实是自己被地主剥削去的血和汗，得来是不容易的，应该爱惜，用到生产发家的事业上去。
    第二、是保持斗争热气与巩固群众组织。有的村庄群众和干部，可能以为紧张地斗争了一年，春节应该休息一下了，这样就松下来，群众组织也就涣散起来，地主恶霸即可利用这个机会，或获得喘息机会阴谋反攻，或用小恩小惠软化干部，使翻身运动半途而废。对这一问题，主要是在干部和群众中，深入进行阶级教育，严密组织，如年关开些想想会，进行翻身思想反省。举行群众宣誓，以坚定斗志等，都是很必要的。
