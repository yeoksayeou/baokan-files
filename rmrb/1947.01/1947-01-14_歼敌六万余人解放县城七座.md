Weekly Battle Situation

　　Annihilated Over 60,000 Enemies, Liberated Seven County Towns
    In the first ten days of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), Chiang Kai-shek, in the Central Plains battlefields of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Su-Wan (where 46% of Chiang's troops were stationed), lost approximately 60,000 troops from seven brigades. Chiang's army occupied three empty cities: Daming, Guancheng, and Puyang. The People's Liberation Army, on the other hand, recovered seven county towns: Liancheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Yicheng, Pixian, Yixian, and Guoyang. This is Chiang Kai-shek's most miserable defeat since he launched a full-scale civil war in July of last year. It sets a new record for the People's Liberation Army in annihilating numerous enemies and recovering vast amounts of lost territory in the shortest amount of time. Chiang's plan to control southern Shandong, cut off the connections between the Su-Wan and Shandong liberated areas, and then eliminate the Su-Wan liberated area has completely failed. This fact shows that the situation in this central battlefield is gradually changing, and the balance of power between the enemy and us has begun to undergo significant changes. Chiang's army is facing increasing difficulties, and his one-sided occupation of cities and territories is a thing of the past. The People's Liberation Army's strength is growing, and it is not only able to annihilate a large number of enemy forces but also able to launch local counter-offensives and recover some cities.
    On the morning of the 4th, the New Fourth Army in southern Shandong concluded a major annihilation battle against Chiang's troops that had invaded the Xiangcheng-to-Lanling line, 70 miles southwest of Linyi. Within 40 hours, the entire force of the 40th Brigade and 169th Brigade of the 26th Division of Chiang's army, as well as the rapid column composed of the 80th Brigade and directly subordinate artillery regiment, transportation regiment, engineer regiment, and tank battalion of the 28th Division (one of Chiang Kai-shek's only two fully American-equipped rapid columns), were completely wiped out. Over 20,000 were captured alive, including Ding Yaofu, the brigade commander of the 459th Brigade. Over 7,000 were killed or wounded, including Jiang Fanren, the brigade commander of the 40th Brigade. Over a thousand American-style machine guns and other weapons were captured, and over 40 important strongholds were recovered. The victory was then used to expand the results. On the 11th, Yixian City, which had been occupied last October, was recovered, and another three regiments of Chiang's troops were annihilated.
    On the Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield west of the Jinpu Railway, General Liu Bocheng's troops, following the great victories of recovering the cities of Juye and Jiaxiang and annihilating over 5,000 enemies, annihilated invading Chiang's troops at Jiangjialou, six miles north of Yutai, on the 9th. Over 7,000 were captured alive, including Xie Mengquan, the brigade commander of the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division, who had just been transferred from Taiwan. Over 2,000 were killed or wounded. At the same time, another People's armed force was active on the border of Yu-Wan-Su, and on the evening of the 7th, it recovered Guoyang City in northwestern Anhui, as well as 11 nearby strongholds. Chiang Kai-shek, suffering such a heavy blow in a week, frantically and secretly accelerated the blocking of the Yellow River and the release of water, submerging millions of people along the river in Ji-Lu-Yu in an attempt to salvage his military failure in this area. The floodwaters have now crossed the Xinbian Highway, and the military and civilians of Ji-Lu-Yu are rising up to defend themselves and provide rescue.
    In addition, the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army repelled Yan's troops invading from Fenyang, Yangqu, and Xin County to reinforce Chiang's troops in Pucheng, killing and capturing over 1,300. On the 3rd, it recovered Qingshuihe in southern Sui in one fell swoop, killing and capturing over 700 of Fu's puppet troops. After recovering Jicheng, the Taiyue troops advanced in two directions to the Tongpu Railway line. After several days of fierce fighting, they have recovered the important towns of Gaoxian and Shicun, which had been briefly occupied by Hu's troops, and 40 li of railway have returned to our hands.
    This shows that Hu Zongnan's army is overwhelmed and unable to attend to all fronts. When it attacked Lüliang in the west, it was unable to fully control the southern section of the Jinpu Railway that it had originally occupied.
    In the Northeast, the 113th Regiment of the 38th Division of Chiang's New First Army, entrenched on the west bank of the Songhua River in Qitamu, constantly invaded and harassed. On the 6th, it was subjected to a defensive counterattack by the Democratic Allied Army, which killed and captured over 900, including Wang Dongli, the regimental commander.

### 歼敌六万余人解放县城七座

　　歼敌六万余人解放县城七座
    民国三十六年的头一个十天，蒋介石在内战中心的晋冀鲁豫、苏皖战场（该战场蒋军占其全部兵力百分之四十六），损失了七个旅约六万之众，蒋军侵占了大名、观城、濮阳三座空城。人民解放军则收复了联城、巨野、嘉祥、翼城、邳县、峄县、涡阳七座县城。这是蒋介石自去年七月发动大规模内战以来最悲惨的失败，开创了人民解放军在最短时间内歼灭众多敌人、和收复广大失地的新纪录。使蒋军控制鲁南、切断苏皖与山东解放区联系，进而消灭苏皖解放区的计划，完全破产。这一事实显示这一中心战场的战局，正在逐渐转变，敌我力量已经开始发生重大的变化。蒋军困难增加，他的单方面侵城略地的局面，已成过去。人民解放军力量增长，不仅能大量歼灭敌人有生力量，且已能局部反攻，收复若干城市。
    鲁南新四军于四日上午结束对侵入临沂西南七十里向城至兰陵一线蒋军的大歼灭战，四十小时内，蒋军二十六师之四十旅，一六九旅及师部与由二十八师之八十旅及直属炮兵团、交通兵团、工兵团、战车营等组成之快速纵队（这是蒋介石仅有的两个全部美械化的快速纵队之一）全军覆灭，生俘四五九旅旅长丁尧夫以下两万余人，另毙伤四十旅旅长蒋凡仁以下七千余人，缴获全部美式武器机枪千余挺，收复重要据点四十余处，并乘胜扩大战果。十一日，收复去年十月被占的峄县城，再歼蒋军三个团。
    津浦路西的冀鲁豫战场刘伯承将军所部，继收复巨野、嘉祥两城歼敌五千余人之大胜后，复于九日在鱼台北六里蒋家楼歼灭出犯蒋军，生俘甫由台湾调来的七十师一四○旅旅长谢梦权以下七千余人，另毙伤其二千余人。同时，另一支人民武装则活跃于豫皖苏边缘，于七日晚收复皖西北的涡阳城，及附近十一处据点。蒋介石在一周内遭此沉重打击，竟丧心病狂秘密加紧黄河堵口放水，淹我冀鲁沿河数百万人民，以图挽救其在这一地区军事上的失败，现水头已越过新汴路，冀鲁豫军民正奋起自卫抢救中。
    此外，晋绥八路军击退由汾阳、阳曲、忻县出犯之阎军，以增援蒲城之蒋军，毙俘其一千三百余人。三日一举收复绥南之清水河，毙俘傅伪军七百余人。太岳部队于收复冀城后，即两路挺进至同蒲铁路沿线，经数日激战，已收复被胡军一度侵占之高显、史村等重镇，已有四十里铁路重归我手。
    这说明胡宗南军顾此失彼，当西向进攻吕梁时，其原侵占之间蒲路南段即无法完全控制。
    东北方面盘踞松花江西岸其塔木蒋军新一军三十八师一一三团不断四出侵扰。六日遭民主联军自卫反击，毙俘该团团长王东篱以下九百余人。
