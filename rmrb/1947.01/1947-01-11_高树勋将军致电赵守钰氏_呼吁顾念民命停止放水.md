[This dispatch from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Headquarters on the 9th] General Gao Shuxun sent a telegram to Zhao Youqin (Shouyu), Chairman of the Yellow River Committee, advising him to stop damming and releasing water. The original telegram is as follows:

Chairman Zhao Youqin (Shouyu) of the Yellow River Committee:

Before the completion of the dike restoration project on the old course of the Yellow River, the suffering caused by damming and releasing water is beyond description. You are in charge of this matter, and you should consider the country and the nation, strive for a proper plan, and avoid leaving harm to future generations. This is not only my personal wish, but also the common prayer of millions of people downstream. I am sending this telegram to state this directly, hoping for your consideration.

Your brother, Gao Shuxun, Zi Qi.
