Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: A dispatch from Beiping reports that the Chiang Kai-shek government is extremely tolerant of traitors. Even when traitors have been reported and arrested under public pressure, they are either not tried for a long time, or not executed after trial. For example, the number one traitor, Zhou Fo Hai, although sentenced to death, the judge hinted to Zhou after the verdict, allowing him to appeal, and saying, "There are ways to figure it out." The heads of the North China traitors, Wang Yitang, Zhang Yanqing, etc., who are under detention, are still without any resolution. According to the Tianjin Dagong Bao on the 3rd, among the traitor cases accepted by the Hebei Higher Court, only 174 cases were concluded by the end of the year, and 340 traitor cases remain unclosed. Recently, the Nanjing Judicial Yuan, in order to implement Chiang Kai-shek's defense of traitors, has issued an order to "stop the people's right to expose traitors," and a large number of unprosecuted traitors are rejoicing.

　　蒋介石包庇汉奸
    【新华社延安十三电】北平讯：蒋介石政府对汉奸百般宽容，即对已被告发，受群众压力不得不予逮捕之汉奸，或迟迟不加审理，或审理后延不处决。如头号汉奸周佛海，虽被判处死刑，但法官于判决后即向周示意，允其上诉。并称：“有法可想。”受押之华北汉奸头子王揖唐、张燕卿等，迄今亦无下文。据三日天津大公报称：河北高等法院所受理之汉奸案中，迄年底仅审结一百七十四件，尚有三百四十件汉奸案未加审结。而最近南京司法院为贯彻蒋介石之辩护汉奸，已颁发“停止人民对汉奸之揭发权”命令，大批未被检举之汉奸皆额手称庆。
