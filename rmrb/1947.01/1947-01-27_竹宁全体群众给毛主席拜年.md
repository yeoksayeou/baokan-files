(Report from Changzhi by this newspaper) The masses of Zhuning Village in the Second District of Zuoquan County wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to wish him a Happy New Year during the Lunar New Year. The original text is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:

    First, let us tell you that we have all been emancipated! The eleven landlord despots in the village have been completely overthrown. The good land that our ancestors farmed for generations has all been taken back by us. The silver dollars that the landlords exchanged for the blood and sweat of us poor people have also been recovered by us. We have also bought oxen and donkeys. We live in warm homes, and there are pillows on the kang. On the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month, almost every family had someone going to the city to catch up with the market, cut mutton, buy red paper for Spring Festival couplets, and buy some scraps of cloth for the children... Every family also bought a picture of you. Thinking of the difficult days in the past when we had to drill holes, crawl into cellars, and hide from rent and debts during the twelfth lunar month, and then looking at the happy scene of being able to eat meat dumplings during the New Year, we are really happy. After the New Year, we will wholeheartedly engage in production, and we will definitely do it according to your method of "organizing"! All the old and young people in our village wish you a Happy New Year, and hope that you - live forever, live for ten thousand years!

    The entire peasantry of Zhuning Village, Zuoquan County

    竹宁全体群众给毛主席拜年
    【本报长治讯】左权二区竹宁村群众，在旧历年写信给毛主席拜年，原文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    先告你说，俺们都翻身啦！村上十一家地主恶霸，完全被斗倒了，以前祖先们养种过成板块的那些好地土，俺们都收回来了。地主们拿咱穷人血汗换成的白银现洋，俺们也算回来了，牛驴也买下了。俺们住上了暖家，炕上都有了枕头，腊月二十三，差不多家家都有人进城赶集，割下羊肉，买下贴对联的红纸，给孩子们买了些布布块块……家家还都买了你的一张像。想起往年腊月里钻窟窿、爬地洞、躲租、躲债的难熬法，再看看现在过大年能吃上肉饺子的这种舒心光景，俺们心里真喜欢。过了年，俺们就一心一意闹生产呀，一定照你“组织起来”的办法去办。俺们全村老少给你拜年，盼望你——长生不老，活上万万年！
    左权竹宁村全体农民
