Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, January 18th: Our reporter Hua Shan reports that Du Yuming, when joining forces on the Songhua River, initially drew the majority of his troops to gather on the south bank of the Songhua River, threatening northern Manchuria. However, today he can only mobilize a maximum of four American-equipped divisions in the Northeast, leaving southeastern Manchuria empty and vulnerable, practically inviting an attack. The Chiang army in the south of the Songhua River is preparing to rely on mechanization to bully the Democratic Allied Army, while the Democratic Allied Army is countering "mechanization" with "terrain modification." If the Chiang army wants to cross the river and attack, they will be forced to come down and walk, at which point they will taste the flavor of our army's annihilation warfare. Two popular songs are circulating in our army on the Northeast front: "Eat vegetables, eat the heart of the cabbage, fight battles, especially fight the New First Army." The soldiers are already addicted to fighting the New First Army. The weather in the Northeast is freezing, but the peasants' enthusiasm for terrain modification has not diminished. They use firewood to burn the topsoil, and then use large mattocks to change the terrain. Peasants who have obtained land say: "If we don't drive away the enemy, the land we have divided will not be secure." Those who have not yet obtained land say: "If the Chiang army (Central Army) can't come, we will always be able to divide the land."

　　东北蒋军兵力不足
    【新华社东北十八日电】本社记者华山报导，杜聿明在松花江结合，初期抽调其大半兵力集结松花江南岸，威胁北满，但他今天在东北至多能抽出四个美械师的机动兵力，而东南满则陷于空虚，等于光出屁股准备挨打。蒋军在松花江南准备靠机械化欺负民主联军，而民主联军就以“改造地形”对抗“机械化”，蒋军如要过江进攻，就得被迫用腿下来走，那时就得尝尝我军歼灭战的滋味。东北前线我军流行两句歌谣“吃菜要吃白菜心，打仗专打新一军”，战士们对于打新一军已经上瘾了。东北天寒地冻，但农民的改造地形热情并未稍减，他们以柴草火化地皮，然后用大嘴镐改变地形。获得土地的农民说：“不打走敌人分了土地还不牢靠”，未得土地的则说：“遭殃军（中央军）过不来总能分到土地”。
