　　Combining Practical Combat with Militia Training
    Jinnan Fourth Military Subdistrict Concentrates Thousands of Militiamen to Advance to the Yuanshi Border Area to Strike at Chiang Kai-shek's Pseudo-Regime
    [Our newspaper's Weixian dispatch, 12th] The Fourth Military Subdistrict Military Affairs Committee concentrated thousands of elite militiamen to carry out armed struggle in the Yuanshi border area, and combined combat with training, achieving good results. After the militiamen arrived at XX village in Yuanshi, they built fortifications on the same day, caught up with the Gangwang battle on the second day, and then caught up with the Duancun battle on the third day, striking at the fierce flames of Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-regime and protecting the interests of the masses. The masses were extremely excited and offered condolences of two large pigs and one sheep. In the most recent ten days, they cut electric wires, destroyed railways, and conducted ambushes 14 times, killing and wounding 41 enemies. From fighting the enemy on one hand and training on the other, the following experiences were gained: 1. Learning and application can be well combined, experience can be gained from combat, and the "old guard" phenomenon among the militiamen can be overcome. After the Duancun battle ended, the advantages and disadvantages were immediately reviewed. Many militiamen realized that it was not possible not to learn, it was not possible not to dig trenches, and it was not possible not to build fortifications, otherwise there would be no way to deal with the enemy when they came. 2. If leading cadres go deep, the results will be great. When the Third Platoon of the First Company of Nangong came, some militiamen were not in high spirits. After meetings and individual education, their spirits gradually stabilized and they performed very well in training. At the same time, grasping and cultivating activists and strengthening political work also played a guaranteeing role. 3. Leading the militia should have a democratic style, and local cadres and military cadres should be well integrated. In the company's organization, it is best if the cadres and militiamen are all from the same district, which is convenient for leadership. The militiamen of the Third Platoon of the Ninth Company of Weixian are from the Second District, and the company cadres are from the First District, so the leadership is not very convenient. 4. When training the militia, the company organization should be equipped with district cadres. The Fifth Company of Guangzong, the Seventh Company of Nanhe, and the Second Company of Renxian were all organized with districts as units for both cadres and militiamen, and the relationship between cadres and militiamen was very good. From the militia's reflections, it was learned that some militiamen have the idea of being hired and the idea of "holding on", which requires strengthening political education in the future, establishing and consolidating the idea of serving the masses, and establishing an overall concept.

　　结合实战训练民兵
    冀南四分区集中民兵数千开赴元氏边沿区打击蒋伪
    【本报威县十二日电】四分区武委会集中精干民兵数千人，在元氏边沿区开展武装斗争，并结合战斗进行训练，获得良好成绩。民兵到元氏××村后，当天筑了工事，第二天赶上岗汪战斗，第三天又赶上段村战斗，打击了蒋伪的凶焰，保卫了群众利益、群众极为兴奋，慰劳大猪两口、羊一只。在最近十几天内，共割电线、破铁路、打伏击十四次，毙伤敌人四十一名，从一面对敌斗争一面训练中，得到以下几点经验：一、学与用能很好结合，从战斗中取得经验，克服了民兵的老大现象。在段村战斗结束后，马上检讨优缺点，许多民兵认识了自己不学不行，战壕不挖不行，工事不筑不行，不然敌人来了没办法。二、领导干部深入成绩就大。南宫一连三排来时，有个别民兵情绪不高，经过开会和个别教育，情绪逐渐稳定，在训练中表现很好。同时抓紧与培养积极分子，加强政治工作，也起了保证作用。三、领导民兵应有民主作风，应使地方干部与军队干部很好结合，在连的编制上，干部及民兵顶好都是一个区的，这样便于领导。威县九连三排民兵是二区的，连干部是一区的，领导上就不甚方便。四、训练民兵时，连的编制要配备区的干部。广宗五连，南和七连，任县二连，干部及民兵都是以区为单位编制起来的，干部和民兵的关系都很好。从民兵反省中了解，有些民兵存在雇佣思想与撑劲思想，这需要今后加强政治教育，树立与巩固为群众服务的思想，树立整体观念。
