　　Brilliant Victory of Local Troops Behind Enemy Lines
    Our Yu-Wan-Su Forces Capture Woyang City
  　Briefly Disrupting the Longhai Railway, Causing Extreme Panic Among the Enemy in Kaifeng, Seriously Threatening Chiang's Troops Invading Su-Wan and Ji-Lu-Yu
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Yu-Wan-Su local troops behind enemy lines have achieved another glorious victory. On the 7th, they liberated Woyang City in northwestern Anhui, and briefly disrupted the Longhai Railway. The military region has issued an order to commend them. Our Yu-Wan-Su forces have fought bravely behind enemy lines and achieved repeated victories, seriously threatening the Jinpu and Longhai Railways, two major blood vessels for Chiang's internal war, and containing Chiang's troops invading the Su-Wan and Ji-Lu-Yu liberated areas. Chiang's troops were forced to mobilize the 190th Regiment of the 64th Brigade of the 15th Division, the 2nd Regiment of the Henan Security Force, and four regiments of Zhang Lanfeng's troops. On the 30th of last month, they set out from Qi County, Taikang, and Ju County to "mop up" our Qi-Tai-Ju triangle area. When they entered our heartland, our troops had already shifted to the outer lines and made a long-distance raid to the enemy's far rear. After destroying the Zhude Temple, Gucheng, and Huagouji (south of Luyi) town governments along the way, they launched an attack on Woyang County seat and its surrounding eleven strongholds on the night of the 7th after two hours of fighting, liberating a vast area of 3,600 square li in the suburbs. In this battle, a part of the New 10th Brigade of Chiang's 58th Division and local bandits were annihilated, totaling over 80 killed or wounded, and over 160 captured alive. The spoils included seven light machine guns, two grenade launchers, over 400 rifles, 40,000 rounds of ammunition, 150 mortar shells, over 400 hand grenades, one radio station, four telephones, two war horses, hundreds of thousands of catties of grain, and thousands of bags of flour. We only suffered twelve casualties, with an enemy-to-us loss ratio of 20 to 1. Furthermore, from the 28th to the 30th of last month, our Yu-Wan-Su forces carried out destruction operations on the Kaifeng-to-Luowang section and the Lanfeng-to-Minquan section of the Longhai Railway, destroying a total of nine li of road and collecting a part of the telephone wires. As a result, the Longhai traffic was once interrupted, causing extreme panic among Chiang's troops in the Kaifeng area.
