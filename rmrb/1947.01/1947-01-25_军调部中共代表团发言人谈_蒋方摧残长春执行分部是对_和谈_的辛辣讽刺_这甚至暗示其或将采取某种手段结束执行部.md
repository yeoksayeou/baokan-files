Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd—A spokesperson for the CCP Delegation to the Military Mediation Department in Peiping recently issued a statement regarding the outrage of the Kuomintang's Changchun Garrison Headquarters illegally detaining personnel from the CCP Delegation to the Changchun Executive Headquarters on the 16th of this month. He stated that the destruction of the Changchun sub-office, which was engaged in peace work, is a bitter satire of the Kuomintang's warmongering clique's current large-scale propaganda of sending Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to resume "peace talks." Now, as the Executive Headquarters marks its first anniversary, the Changchun incident has occurred, which is the best "summary" of the Kuomintang warmongering clique's so-called "peaceful mediation" this year. This even hints that they may take some means to end the Executive Headquarters. The spokesperson continued: Since the establishment of the Military Mediation Department a year ago, the Kuomintang authorities have adhered to the policy of civil war and have no sincerity in peaceful mediation. The Kuomintang authorities in various places have repeatedly committed atrocities of obstructing mediation work by relying on force. No matter how the Kuomintang distorts propaganda in an attempt to shift the responsibility for the failure of mediation onto the CCP, such as the recent publication of a booklet by the government side of the Military Mediation Department full of criminal lies, facts speak louder than words. Since the establishment of the Military Mediation Department, dozens of our personnel participating in mediation work have suffered various illegal atrocities and even been beaten, insulted, and killed by the Kuomintang authorities.

　　军调部中共代表团发言人谈
    蒋方摧残长春执行分部是对“和谈”的辛辣讽刺
    这甚至暗示其或将采取某种手段结束执行部
    【新华社延安二十三日电】北平讯：北平军调部中共代表团发言人，顷就本月十六日国民党长春卫戍司令部非法禁锢长春执行分部中共代表团人员之暴行发表谈话称：从事和平工作的长春分部之被摧残，正是对国民党好战集团目前大肆宣传派张治中赴延恢复“和谈”的一种辛辣讽刺。现在，恰是执行部一周年，长春事件发生，也正是国民党好战集团自己这一年的所谓“和平调处”的最好“总结”。这甚至暗示他们或将采取某种手段，结束执行部，发言人继称：自军调部成立一年来，国民党当局坚持内战方针，对和平调处毫无诚意，各地国民党当局凭恃武力阻挠调处工作之暴行，曾不断发生。不论国民党方面如何歪曲宣传，妄图将调处失败责任诿诸中共身上；如最近军调部政府方面曾发行充满罪恶谎言的小册子，但事实胜于雄辩，自军调部成立以来，我方参加调处工作的人员遭受国民党当局各种非法暴行甚至殴辱杀害事件即达数十件之多。
