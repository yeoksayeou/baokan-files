　　[This dispatch from our newspaper's Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu bureau on the 21st] On the 17th at midnight, the Yellow River floodwaters reached Shaojiaji in Shouzhang County, and at 6 PM on the 18th, they reached Xinzhuang in Shouzhang. The water flow is expanding along the old course towards both banks. Wherever the water reaches, residents of new villages in the riverbed and villages along the banks are wailing about not having time to build boats or the strength to relocate. They are spreading the word and universally resent Chiang Kai-shek's sinister plot to flood the liberated areas. More than twenty new villages in the Fan County riverbed have been flooded. The democratic government is now urgently trying to provide relief, organizing mutual aid teams to rescue property and resettle disaster victims.
    [Another dispatch] After the Yellow River water flowed into the liberated area's old course, many dangerous engineering works are on the verge of collapse. The 27 sections of the Lisheng Tun dangerous engineering work in Juancheng and the 54 sections of the huge engineering work from Lujia to Shilipu in Kunwu are at risk, as construction was never carried out due to Chiang's side violating the river management agreement. Moreover, the original dams and dam foundations have been destroyed and leveled by enemy puppets and Chiang's side. If Chiang's side does not block the diversion canals and the main stream of the Yellow River pours down, these dangerous engineering works will inevitably be washed away, causing a major disaster. Residents along the banks are anxious and uneasy day and night about this.
    [Urgent dispatch from our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu bureau on the 20th] Chiang Kai-shek is playing a double game, breaking the verbal agreement of the Handan Conference, and has released water to flow back into the old course. On the 12th of this month, the Yellow River water entered our territory between Changyuan and Dongming. On the 13th, it flowed to Batou in Kunwu County (formerly part of Puyang). On the 14th, it flowed to Linpuji in Juancheng. On the 15th, it flowed to Xiaoyanglou. On the 16th, it flowed to Liqiao in Pu County. On the 17th, it flowed into Shouzhang County. After flowing to Liqiao, the water level rose to one meter, and the depth behind the water level reached two to three meters. East of Xiaoyanglou, because the riverbed is flat, the speed has increased rapidly from seven li per hour to ten li per hour. The water surface is one to two li wide. The dangerous engineering works of the South Small Embankment around Batou and the dangerous engineering works and embankments on the south bank of Nanhua are being eroded. The materials we prepared in the past have been looted by Chiang's army. We have sent people to repair the embankment several times, but they were disrupted by Chiang's army and failed to complete the repairs. If an accident occurs, Puyang, Pu County, Zhangqiu, Shouzhang, and Fan County on the north bank, and Heze, Juancheng, Yuncheng, and Juye on the south bank will be submerged. The Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office has urgently ordered the county governments along the river to find ways to provide relief and to relocate residents of the riverbed. The Administrative Office has allocated 2 million jin of grain for temporary relief.

　　黄河故道居民痛恨蒋介石放水
    范县河床二十余村被淹
    多处险工已经危在旦夕
    民主政府正紧急援救
    【本报晋冀鲁豫二十一日电】黄河水头十七日午夜流到寿张县属邵家集，十八日下午六时达寿张新庄。水流正沿故道向两岸扩展。水到处河床新村与沿岸村庄居民以无暇造船，无力迁移，叫苦连天，奔走相告，一致痛恨蒋介石水淹解放区的险恶阴谋。范县河床中已有二十余新村被淹，现民主政府正紧急设法援救，组织互助队，抢救财物，安置灾民。
    【又讯】黄水流入解放区故道后，多处险工已危在旦夕，鄄城李升屯险工二十七道、与昆吾路家到十里铺的五十四道坝等巨大险工，均因蒋方破坏治河协议，未曾动工。且原有坝及坝基已被敌伪及蒋方破坏平毁，若蒋方再不堵塞引河，黄河主流倾泻而至，此类险工必被冲毁，酿成巨灾，沿岸居民为此已日夜焦虑不安。
    【本报冀鲁豫廿日急电】蒋介石玩弄两面手法，破坏邯郸会议的口头协议，已放水流归故道。本月十二日，黄水已进入我境长垣与东明之间，十三日流至昆吾县坝头（旧濮阳属），十四日流至鄄城临濮集，十五日流至小杨楼，十六日流至濮县李桥，十七日流入寿张县境。流至李桥后，水头即涨至一公尺，水头后面深二公尺至三公尺。小杨楼以东，因河床平坦，速度已由一小时七华里，急至十华里。水面宽一华里至二华里。坝头一带南小堤的险工与南华的南岸的险工、坝甚正被冲刷，我方过去准备的材料，已被蒋军抢劫一空，我方曾数次派人前往抢修，又遭蒋军扰乱，至未能修筑，若一旦出险，北岸的濮阳、濮县、张秋、寿张、范县等；南岸的荷泽、鄄城、郓城、钜野等均将被淹没。现冀鲁豫行署，已急令沿河各县政府设法救济，并给河床居民迁移住地。行署特拨粮二百万斤进行临时救济。
