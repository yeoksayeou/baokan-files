Licheng Finance Cadres Overcome Simple Tax Collection Viewpoint
	Organize the Masses to Produce and Pay Taxes, Financial Management Combined with Production
	Rectify Village Public Property, Invest in Production
	Village Funds Raised and Spent Locally, No Taxes Levied on the Masses

[This dispatch from Changzhi, 14th] Licheng County's financial cadres have overcome the simple tax collection viewpoint and are completing tax collection tasks by developing the national economy and organizing mass production. During this unified progressive tax collection, they put forward the slogan of organizing sideline income to pay public funds, not letting the masses sell grain to pay taxes. In Renzhuang, organizing the masses for transportation once yielded a profit of over 20,000 yuan, with a surplus of over 34,000 yuan after paying taxes. In Niuju Village, organizing the masses to dig up medicinal materials yielded a profit of 19,000 yuan, with a surplus of over 9,000 yuan after paying taxes. Other villages, such as Xiluotuo, also completed tax collection by organizing weaving, cutting mountain products, transportation, and other temporary production activities. In over 60% of the county's villages, taxes were paid with profits from temporary production. This not only completed the tax collection work quickly but also developed winter sideline production and increased the economic income of the masses. The county also combines financial management with production, investing in production to expand income while not hindering payments. 1. Last year, temporary unused local funds were lent to mass cooperatives and merchants, yielding a profit of over 117,000 yuan and supporting the mass production cause. 2. Various local expenses are directly used for production related to the respective cause, and then the profits are used for expenditure. For example, last year, the county's education funds were used to open education stores, led by a management committee jointly organized by the finance and education sections. After being reorganized last year, the county's village finances also completely realized the system of village funds raised and spent locally, with the county and districts in control and inspection. Village funds raised and spent locally are also limited to rectifying village public property, not levying taxes on the masses. After the village public property is rectified, it is invested in organizing production, and the profits are used to cover village expenses. For example, Renzhuang planted five mu of cotton on village public land and sold part of the public property to invest in cooperatives, yielding a profit of over 40,000 yuan, which solved the village's annual expenses. Seven fen of wasteland were reclaimed to plant hemp, ensuring the supply of lamp oil for the village office and primary school. Beiliu Village withdrew 10,000 yuan of public welfare funds from the cooperative for reinvestment in production, solving the village's expenses. All expenses in the village must be decided through democratic discussions by the masses, and each village has organized a democratically elected public property management committee. Last year, the burden on the people throughout the county was reduced by 400,000 jin of rice and over 740,000 yuan for local education expenses, and over 550,000 yuan for village expenses. The difficulties of education expenses and village expenses were completely overcome, the masses' concern for education was closely linked, and the education cause was developed.

　　黎城财政干部克服单纯征收观点
    组织群众生产缴款  财政管理结合生产
    整顿村公产投资搞生产
    村款村筹不向群众征收
    【本报长治十四日电】黎城县财政干部克服了单纯征收观点，从发展国民经济，组织群众生产中来完成征收任务。此次征收统累税款时，提出了组织副业收入交公款，不让群众卖粮交款的口号。在仁庄组织群众运输一次，获利除交款二万余元外，尚余三万四千余元。在牛居村组织群众刨药材获利一万九千元，交款外尚余九千余元。其他如西骆驼等村亦以组织编造、砍山货、运输等临时生产完成征收。全县百分之六十以上的村庄，均系以临时生产得利交款，不仅征收工作完成迅速，并发展了冬季副业生产，为群众增加了经济收入。该县在财政管理上亦与生产结合，在不妨碍支付原则下，进行投资生产，以扩大收入。一、去年以暂时存储不用的地方款，贷给群众合作社及商贩，获利十一万七千余元，并扶植了群众的生产事业。二、以各项地方经费直接进行有关本项事业的生产，再以其利得开支。如去年将县教育经费开办教育商店，由财教两科共同组织管委会领导。去年全县村财政经整理后，亦完全实现了村款村筹，村筹村支，由县区掌握、检查的制度。村款村筹亦限于整顿村公产，而非向群众征收。村公产经整顿后，即投资组织生产，以其利得供村款开支。如仁庄以村公地种棉花五亩，卖公产一部投资合作社，获利四万余元，即解决了全年的村款开支。以开荒七分种大麻，保证供给了村公所与小学校的灯油。北流村从合作社抽公益万元投入再生产，解决了村款开支。村中一切开支，都须经过群众民主讨论决定，各村均组织有民选的公产管委会。去年全县为人民减轻的负担，计地方教育经费米四十万斤，款七十四万余元，村款五十五万余元。并彻底克服了教育经费及村经费的困难，密切了群众对教育的关心，发展了教育事业。
