    Comrade Mao Zedong's Childhood
    (Continued)
    Xiao San
    Always Eager to Learn from a Young Age
    Comrade Mao Zedong began reading at the age of eight and did not leave the private school until he was thirteen. At that time, the Confucian classics taught in private schools were extremely dull and tasteless for children. The teaching method at that time was also what everyone knows: rote memorization, but the teacher did not explain what the book said, and it was not easy to explain clearly. Most of the elementary school students were confused, some completely did not understand, and some seemed to understand. Only after a lot of time, when the ability to understand developed, did they gradually understand; when they understood, it was quite interesting. Comrade Zedong often humorously quotes Confucius, Mencius, the Four Books and Five Classics in his reports and speeches to this day. He uses new viewpoints, borrows old words and historical facts to explain new things. Because Chinese people, especially those of his generation and older intellectuals, know those classics, they feel particularly pertinent and interesting when they hear them. Furthermore, Comrade Mao Zedong has a very rich knowledge of Chinese history. When he was a child, he opposed studying books by rote; he did not like the Confucian classics, but liked many popular Chinese novels: The Story of Yue Fei, Stories of the Tang Dynasty, Journey to the West, Investiture of the Gods, and later Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms... and so on. In the private school, he hid the novels under the Confucian classics and read them secretly. When the teacher walked by, he covered them with the Confucian classics. Although he did not like those Confucian classics, he could remember them when he read them and recite them, so he had time to read novels; the teacher asked him to recite the Confucian classics and he recited them, so although he occasionally knew that he was reading those miscellaneous books, there was no way to blame him. Comrade Zedong remembered the stories and characters in the novels very well, and often told them to others when he was a child and discussed them with everyone. Later, those readings had a great influence on him; to this day, Comrade Mao Zedong often quotes certain stories and characters from Chinese and foreign literary works and history to illustrate new problems, so that listeners can understand and appreciate them more deeply. At the same time, he uses the viewpoints and methods of materialist dialectics and historical materialism to analyze various literary works and writers, which is very incisive and beyond the reach of many specialized literary theory critics. This shows how broad and deep he is! Yes, Comrade Mao Zedong advocates the "method of combining Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern."
    In the year he turned thirteen, Comrade Zedong left the private school and worked in the fields all day, and helped his father keep accounts at night. Of course, he was very busy and tired, but he continued to read, reading all the books he could find after keeping accounts at night. His father was not happy: first, his son was not reading classics and history; second, he wanted to save lamp oil. Comrade Zedong covered the window with a blue cloth sheet so that his father could not see the light. In this very simple room (a dilapidated house), under the light of a bean-sized tung oil or vegetable oil lamp, he read many books that he could find.
    Once, he found a book called *Words of Warning in Times of Prosperity* - some concerned people at that time believed that China was so poor and weak because its science was not as developed as in the West. They advocated "investigating things," that is, to study physics (but using the classical term "investigating things to attain knowledge" from the Confucian classic *The Great Learning*). China should build railways, ships... and set up telegraphs and telephones... This was the so-called "policy essay" or "current affairs article" at that time. Comrade Zedong liked it very much; it was much more realistic than the Four Books and Five Classics. This book aroused Comrade Zedong's desire to continue his studies. So he left home and read for half a year at the home of a student who was studying new subjects (law and political science). He also read some classics, histories, philosophical works and collections from an old scholar, Mao Luzhong (the only *xiucai* in the Mao family), as well as some current affairs articles and some new books.
    There is such a story: Once, Comrade Zedong was grazing cattle in the wild. He let the cattle eat grass, but he was leisurely reading a book on the grass under the shade of a big tree. He was so absorbed in reading that he forgot everything. The cattle freely walked into someone else's vegetable garden and ate most of the vegetables. Comrade Zedong did not know until the neighbor discovered it and caused a great disturbance.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has been so eager to learn and so fond of reading since he was a child. He has understood the ancient saying "reading is beneficial" since he was a child, and he has read all the books he could find at that time. His thirst for knowledge has always been very strong. The books he has read are deeply imprinted in his mind, and he still remembers them to this day, so he often "cites scriptures" when talking to people. He has had a strong memory, comprehension, and analytical ability since he was a child. To this day, his habit of reading books and newspapers has not changed. He really has the demeanor of "never putting down a book." No matter when or what the environment, it is the same. Even when he was in Jinggangshan, he always read books in addition to handling military and political affairs. Almost no one has ever seen him go out for a walk or play. Many comrades who have worked with him for many years say in unison with admiration:
    —Chairman Mao is a diligent learner!

    毛泽东同志的儿童时代
    （一续）
    萧三
    从小就好学
    毛泽东同志八岁时开始念书，一直到十三岁才离开那私塾。当时私塾里所教的经书，对于儿童是枯燥无味到了极点的。那时的教授法，也是大家所知道的；死记背诵，但是书里面说的是什么，先生并不讲，讲也不易讲得清楚，小学生们大都是莫明其妙，有的完全不懂，有的似乎可懂。只有在许多时间之后，理解力发达了才渐渐懂得；懂得了，那是相当有味的。泽东同志直到现在作报告及演说时，常常幽默地引孔子孟子、四书五经上的话，那是用新的观点，借旧的辞句和历史事实，来解释新的事物。因为中国人，特别是和他同辈及较长的知识者，都知道那些经典，所以听了觉的特别中肯有趣。再则毛泽东同志对于中国历史知识是非常丰富的。小的时候，他就反对读死书；他不喜欢经书，而喜欢中国流行的许多小说：精忠传啦，说唐啦，西游记啦，封神演义啦，稍晚就是水浒传啦，三国演义啦……等等。在私塾时他把小说藏在经书底下偷着读，老师走过的时候，就用经书盖住。他虽不喜欢那些经书，但读就能记住，能背出来，所以有工夫看小说；先生叫他背诵经书他就背，因此虽偶然知道他在看那些杂书，也没有办法责备他。小说里的故事人物泽东同志都记得非常熟，小时便常向别人讲述，和大家谈论。后来那些读物，对他的影响也很大；直到现在，毛泽东同志时常引中外文艺作品里和历史中的某些故事人物，来说明新的问题，使听者更加了解，更加体会的深刻。同时他用唯物辩证法和历史唯物论的观点与方法，来分析各种文艺作品与作家，非常精辟，为许多专门治文艺理论批评者所不及。这可见他是如何地博而深！是呀，毛泽东同志是提倡“中外古今法”的。
    十三岁的那一年，泽东同志走出了私塾，整天在田里工作，夜晚则帮助他父亲记账，这样当然很忙，也当然疲倦，但他还是继续读书，在夜晚记账后，读所有可能找到的书。他父亲不高兴：一来，儿子不是读的经史；再则要节省灯油呀。泽东同志就用蓝布被单子盖住窗户，使父亲看不见灯光。在这面非常简陋的屋子（楼房——破厦）里，在豆子大的桐油或菜油灯光下面，他读了他所能找到的许多书。
    有一次他找到了一册《盛世危言》——那是当时的一些有心人士，认为中国这样贫弱，是由于科学不如西洋发达。他们提倡“格物”，就是说，要研究物理学，（但用经书“大学”上“格物致知”这个古典术语）中国要修铁路轮船………要设电报电话………这是当时所谓“学策论”或“时务文章”一类的书，泽东同志很喜欢它；比四书五经现实的多，由于这一部书引起泽东同志再前进求学的志愿。于是他离开了家庭，到一个学新学的（法政学生）家里读了半年书。又从一位老学者毛麓钟（毛家唯一的秀才）读了些经史子集，也读了些时务文章和一些新书。
    有这样一个故事，有一次泽东同志在野外放牛。他让牛吃草，自己却在大树荫下的草地上，悠闲地看书。他看得那样入神，忘记了一切。牛自由的走进了别人家的菜园把青菜吃了一大半，泽东同志还不知道，等邻人发觉后，闹了一场大乱子。
    毛泽东同志从小就是这样好学，这样喜欢读书的。他从小就体会了“开卷有益”这句古话，那时所能找到的书，他都读遍了。他的求知欲一向是很强的。读过了的书都深深地印入了他的脑筋里，一直到现在他都记得，因此和人谈话时常是“引经据典”的。他从小就有很强的记忆力，理解力，和分析力。一直到现在，他这种读书报的习惯是没有改变的。真有“手不释卷”之概。无论什么时候，什么环境，都是如此。就是在井岗山上的时候，他在处理军政事务之外，总是读书。几乎没有看见过他出来散散步，玩玩的。许多和他在一道工作多年的同志们都异口同声这样钦敬的说：
    ——毛主席是一个好学的人！
