    Leopard Valley, Yangzhuang, and Other Villages
    Small Textile Factories
    Everyone Gains Huge Profits
    Women Can Enter Factories to Weave Cloth for Themselves
    [This newspaper's Changzhi News] With the help of cooperatives, women in Leopard Valley and ＠shang villages in Wu'an organized six small cooperative textile factories last winter in the tenth lunar month, and have made substantial profits in the past two months. Leopard Valley Factory No. 4, as of the 6th of this month, 56 women have earned 366,000 yuan from spinning 580+ jin of thread with 1400+ work units. ＠shang's two factories also spin and weave; 41 women wove 170 jin of white cloth with 490 work units, earning 135,000 yuan. Women in the factory can also bring their own cotton to the factory to weave for themselves through labor exchange. During this period, the cloth woven by the women for their families to make new clothes for the New Year also reached 277 jin. The factory is a labor cooperative in nature. The cooperative provides raw materials at a price, and the cooperative purchases and resells the finished products. Profits are calculated and distributed according to work units, and dividends are distributed according to shares. Leopard Valley Factory No. 4, after deducting all expenses for food, lamp oil, etc., earned a net profit of 194 yuan per work unit. This year's textile industry in the village has not only solved the problem of clothing, but also solved all the expenses of farmers in winter. For example, Guo Quantang and her daughter joined the factory. In addition to weaving 26 jin of cloth for themselves through labor exchange to solve the cotton clothes for a family of five, they earned more than 12,000 yuan for working in the factory. And their family's expenses for salt, lamp oil, and hiring livestock to plow 20 mu of land since autumn were only 11,000 yuan. Textile hero Hao Heting was not at home because he was attending the conference of heroes. His 16-year-old daughter participated in the factory, not only weaving more than 8 jin of cloth for herself through labor exchange, but also earning more than 4,000 yuan, which solved the problem of salt, lamp oil, and the unified accumulated tax payments due last fall for three months. There are also compulsory education classes in the factory on a rotating basis, and winter school has not been delayed. Each factory has democratically elected administrators (in charge of food), managers (distributing cotton and collecting thread), and mediators (resolving disputes and handling problems), all of whom do not leave production. Democratic management, scoring based on technology, quality of finished products, and democratic evaluation. Cooking and other miscellaneous tasks are counted as work points for dividends. The women in the factory hold a group meeting every five days, and the cadres of each factory hold a meeting every seven days to exchange experiences. The cooperative not only supplies raw materials and purchases finished products, but also its accountant helps each factory with bookkeeping every night. The village also does its best to help the factory. For example, the village head of Leopard Valley, the chairman of the farmers' association, the head of the cooperative, and the primary school teachers each help a factory solve difficulties. Last month, due to the difficulty of buying firewood for the factory during the mass movement period, the village mobilized children to chop 2,000 jin of firewood and sell it to the factory. Allowing women to exchange labor for their own spinning and weaving in the factory is also one of its important experiences. In the first factory led by Gao Yun, the textile hero of Leopard Valley Village, the women were very productive at first, but the number of people coming to the factory gradually decreased in the twelfth lunar month. The reason was that they could only earn money for the factory by weaving in the factory, while the women still had to weave for their own families. After discussion, it was decided that they could bring cotton to the factory for labor exchange weaving, and the labor used would be deducted from their working days for the factory. After each factory adopted this method, the women's production enthusiasm increased.
    [This newspaper's Jingxing News] The textile industry in Yangzhuang Village, Jingxing, has made great progress. In the past, the village's sewing thread was all purchased from outside. Since the establishment of a small textile factory last September, the cloth for the clothing of more than 200 households in the village is no longer difficult. The factory has 15 spinning wheels, 5 looms, and one teacher, training spinners and teaching them political classes. The students also learn from each other and constantly improve their skills, making rapid progress. In the past three months, two classes have graduated, and 30 women have mastered skilled spinning and weaving techniques. A total of 60 jin of cotton were spun, and 40 bolts of cloth were woven, which were sold for 100,000 yuan. 30 jin of thread were exchanged for cloth from other villages, and 8 sheng of rice were charged for each jin of thread exchanged for each jin of cloth, earning 4,500 yuan in foreign currency. After deducting the price of cotton and expenses, there was a net profit of 58,500 yuan, with each person earning 1,950 yuan in foreign currency. When distributing dividends, the students happily said, "This method is great! Our village won't have to worry about clothes in the future." Now the village cooperative has purchased a large amount of wood according to the needs of the village women, and is processing and rushing to make machines and spinning wheels, selling them to the spinners at low prices, preparing to expand the factory this year, training new spinners, and the entire village women's association has more than 100 members, and it is expected that they will all learn spinning and weaving in less than a year.

    豹子峪杨庄等村
    小型纺织工厂
    人人均获巨利
    妇女可入厂变工为自己织布
    【本报长治讯】武安豹子峪、＠上两村纺妇在合作社帮助下，于去冬阴历十月组织小型合作性质的纺织工厂六所，两月来获利优厚。豹子峪四厂，截至本月六日，五十六个妇女以一千四百余工纺线五百八十余斤，获利卅六万六千余元。＠上两厂也纺也织，四十一个妇女以四百九十工织出白布一百七十斤，获利十三万五千余元。厂中妇女并可带花入厂，以变工方式为自己纺织。在此期间妇女们为家人过年缝新衣所织的布亦达二百七十七斤。工厂为劳力合作性质，由合作社作价供给原料，成品则由合作社收购转卖。获利按工计分，按分分红，豹子峪四厂除火食、灯油一切开销外，每工获净利一百九十四元。该村今年纺织不仅解决了穿衣问题，并解决了冬季农户的一切开销。如郭全堂母女二人加入工厂，除变工为自己织布廿六斤解决了一家五口人的棉衣外，为工厂作工获利一万二千余元。而她家秋天以来吃盐、灯油与雇牲口犁地廿亩的开支才不过一万一千元。纺织英雄郝何廷参加群英会不在家，其十六岁小女参加工厂，不仅变工为自己织布八斤多，且获利四千余元，解决了三个月吃盐、灯油与去秋应纳之统累税款。工厂中并有义务教育轮流上课，冬学亦未耽误。每厂中有民主选的不脱离生产的事务员（管火食）、管理员（分花收线）与调解员（解决纠纷处理问题）各一。民主管理，按技术、成品好坏、民主评议计分。做饭的与其他杂务均计工分红。厂中妇女五天开小组会一次，七天各厂干部集会一次交流经验。合作社不仅供给原料与收购成品，其会计并每夜帮助各厂记账。村中对工厂亦极力帮助，如豹子峪村长，农会主席，合作社长、小学教员每人帮助一厂解决困难，上月因群运时期工厂买柴困难，村中即发动儿童打柴两千斤卖给工厂。妇女可在工厂变工为自己纺织亦为其重要验验之一。豹子峪村纺织英雄高云领导的一厂，最初妇女生产劲很大，腊月初到厂的人日渐减少，原因是在工厂中只能为工厂纺织赚钱，而妇女们则尚须为自己家中纺织，后经讨论决定可带花入厂变工纺织，其所用工由其为厂作工日中扣除。各厂采用此办法后，妇女生产情绪更形提高。
    【本报井陉讯】井陉杨庄村，纺织业大有进展，该村以前缝衣用线均靠向外购买，自去年九月成立了小型纺织厂后，现在全村二百多户人家的穿布已不困难，该厂有十五架纺车，五架织布机，教师一人，训练纺妇，并教授她们政治课。学员们又互相学习，不断提高技术，进步极快。过去三个月内，毕业了两班，卅个妇女有了熟练的纺织技术。共纺花六十斤，织布四十匹，卖了十万元。自外村拿线换布卅斤，一斤线换一斤布收工价米八升，赚洋四千五百元。除去花价及用费，尚净赚五万八千五百元，每人赚洋一千九百五十元。分红时学员们都愉快地说：“这办法可好啦！咱村以后的穿衣可不用愁了。”现在村合作社已根据该村妇女需要，购下大批木材，加工赶制机子和纺车，低价卖给纺妇，准备今年扩大工厂，训练新纺妇，全村妇救会会员一百来人，预计不到一年，就可全部学会纺织。
