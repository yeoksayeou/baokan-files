    The Battle of Yangzhuang
    Tian Xiao Hu Qi Fang De Hao Jian
    Internal war expert Xue Yue dispatched his elite 88th Division to advance along the Jin (Xiang) Yu (Tai) road. A certain unit of the Eighth Route Army annihilated its main force, the 186th Regiment, on the afternoon of January 9th, north of Yutai City. The focus of this battle was Yangzhuang, eight miles north of the city.

    The battle was raging. A deputy instructor ran in to report to the deputy regimental commander: "We have occupied five or six courtyards in the village, but the casualties are heavy." The deputy regimental commander said, "Even if there's only one person left, we have to keep fighting." At dawn, the enemy blocked the breakthrough, and follow-up troops could not get in. The deputy regimental commander wanted to report the situation to the regiment, but when he picked up the transmitter, he realized the telephone line had been cut. Battalion Commander Teng came to find the deputy regimental commander: "We have lost contact with the regiment. We must fight side by side and listen to your command." Battalion Commander Yang also came to report to the deputy regimental commander that the enemy was counterattacking. The deputy regimental commander said, "Yangzhuang is the second Zhang Fengji. Quickly build fortifications and defend!"

    The enemy's two frontal counterattacks were repelled. In the second counterattack, the enemy concentrated all the light and heavy weapons of the entire regiment and inserted them between the several houses we had occupied. The mountain guns from Yutai City also bombarded continuously. All kinds of shells and grenades rained down like rain, and bullets whistled through the windows, gun holes, alleys, and eaves like wind. The roofs were torn off, the courtyard walls collapsed, the ground was smashed, and dozens of houses were shrouded in smoke. Coupled with the enemy's shouts and screams and the shrill bugle calls of the charge, the situation was very urgent. But the soldiers still calmly lay on the corners of the houses to fire their guns, lay on the ground to throw grenades, aimed with their left eye after their right eye was blinded, and desperately fought the enemy with bayonets. The sixth courtyard was cut off and surrounded by the enemy. The enemy quickly counterattacked to the third house. Battalion commander, instructor, company commander, instructor..., were all throwing grenades one after another. Their faces were blackened by gunpowder. Battalion Commander Yang shouted: "Quickly bring bombs!" The enemy howled loudly outside the courtyard, but grenades were still thrown incessantly. The deputy regimental commander also ran up to deliver grenades. The guards and signalmen were busy pulling the fuses. The enemy's counterattack was finally thwarted.

    At eight o'clock in the morning, the enemy wanted to counterattack again. Only three courtyards were left. The deputy regimental commander found seven cadres and said to them sternly: "This is the situation. Retreating is a dead end. I am a communist party member, and you are also communist party members. Today, we will die together and live together. Battalion Commander Yang, you organize people to defend this courtyard. Battalion Commander Teng, you organize people to defend that courtyard. I will lead people to defend the middle. Everyone swears to guarantee not to lose a single house. If I waver, you will execute me!" The soldiers heard the deputy regimental commander's order and said: "Yes, whoever wavers, execute him!" The engineers tied explosives into small packages to use as grenades, the machine gunners went to the enemy's corpses to find bullets, the soldiers took bayonets from the enemy corpses and attached them to their own guns, the medics carried rifles to bandage the wounded, and the telephone operators dug gun holes to guard the corners of the walls. Each cadre took a rifle. More than sixty comrades each guarded their posts. In the courtyard, except for a few people picking up bullets and finding bombs, no scattered personnel or chaotic scenes could be seen. "Staff Officer Chen, you and the scouts and signalmen guard this courtyard." The deputy regimental commander took a Type 38 rifle and hurriedly went to another courtyard.

    At nine o'clock in the morning, the enemy's three counterattacks were repelled, but they were still preparing to counterattack. Deputy Regimental Commander Zhang wrote a letter to the regimental commander saying: "Even if we leave one person and one gun, we are determined to fight the enemy to the end. We hope you rest well and fight again at night." He handed the letter to two signalmen and said: "Send it to the regimental headquarters quickly. If you are killed, he will take it. If he is killed, you will take it. If both of you are killed, then this letter is finished." As soon as the signalmen ran out of the village entrance, the fourth counterattack began. This time, in addition to increasing the number of casualties, the enemy did not occupy one of our houses or one of our gun holes. The fifth, sixth, and even seventh counterattacks, the more they attacked, the less energy they had. The enemy softened. The soldiers who smoked smoked, and those who talked and laughed talked and laughed. Some were helping the medics roll bandages, and some were eating the rice left by the enemy. Now people began to feel hungry, and sleepiness also came. The enemy's corpses lay flat on the ground, and blood flowed into the muddy pits, dirty and nauseating. The deputy regimental commander walked to Cai Hao and covered them with quilts one by one. Suddenly, he thought of the comrades who were cut off in the sixth courtyard. He asked Battalion Commander Teng: "Who did you lose over there?" Battalion Commander Teng said: "Our 2nd Company Commander Comrade Wu Yongfu is over there with seventy people, but Comrade Wu Yongfu will not surrender and will definitely sacrifice." The deputy regimental commander said with some reproach: "Why didn't you report earlier?"

    Comrade Wu Yongfu was still alive. When the enemy rushed into the sixth courtyard, he jumped into the north room with his pistol and said to the soldiers: "One person fighting desperately is hard for ten people to resist. Listen to my Wu Yongfu's command." Company Commander Wu's voice simply drowned out the sound of bullets and bombs: "Open the windows, set up the machine guns, and sweep!" With a crash, six enemies fell in the courtyard, and the rest rushed into the east room. Company Commander Wu shouted, and a dozen bayonets immediately blocked the door. At this time, in the east room, our comrades were fighting the enemy. The machine gun blocked the door, so they couldn't get out of the house. Company Commander Wu shouted and shouted to support the east room. Both sides in the east room were exhausted. The enemy continued to counterattack from behind and set the north room on fire. Company Commander Wu immediately sent people to dig a hole to the west, first moving the wounded to the west room. The fire grew bigger and bigger. Company Commander Wu directed the soldiers to transfer one by one. When he crawled out of the hole, the main beam of the north room collapsed. The enemy was still counterattacking the west room. "Comrades, fight resolutely! As long as we hold out until dark, our troops will definitely come. After returning, I, Wu Yongfu, guarantee that everyone will be a hero." After twelve o'clock, the enemy dared not charge into the house again. Company Commander Wu said loudly: "Second Platoon Deputy, you rush out and see if Battalion Commander Teng is still there."

    The deputy regimental commander, upon receiving the news that Wu Yongfu was still struggling to fight, immediately planned a counterattack. The key to the counterattack was to seize an independent house south of the road. He gathered all the forces that could participate in the assault, such as the company commander, instructor, and medics. As soon as the covering machine gun opened fire, Fu Zhanming jumped into the courtyard with a submachine gun. The enemy fled into the house with all their might. Fu Zhanming rolled up his sleeves and threw grenades into the house. The follow-up troops followed in. Dozens of enemies squeezed into one room, and hundreds of bombs were thrown into one room. The roof was collapsing, and brains were splattering. "If you don't surrender, you will all be killed, you sons of bitches." Twenty-three living people crawled out from under the bed and from under the corpses, trembling and surrendering. Battalion Commander Teng quickly fought to the sixth courtyard. When Battalion Commander Teng saw Company Commander Wu, he asked bluntly: "Can you still charge?" Company Commander Wu said: "Yes, our energy is just coming up."

    At three o'clock in the afternoon, seven telephone operators had been knocked down six, and the last one finally connected the line. The deputy regimental commander spoke to the regimental commander for the first time: "It's not a problem, we can eliminate the enemy with our own strength." Our troops surrounded from Hezhuang Gaozhuang... from all sides. In the fading dusk, the 186th Regiment was completely annihilated.

    杨庄之战
    天晓  胡奇  方德  郝健
    内战专家薛岳派遣嫡系八十八师沿金（乡）鱼（台）路进犯，八路军某部于一月九日下午在鱼台城北歼灭其主力一八六团，是役战事重心在城北八里的杨庄。
    战事在猛烈的进行着，一个副指导员跑进来报告副团长：“我们已在村里占领了五六座院子，但是伤亡的很多。”副团长说：“剩下一个人也要干。”拂晓敌人封锁住了突破口，后继部队进不来，副团长要向团里报告情况，拿起送话器才知道电话线已断了。滕营长来找副团长：“我们和团里失掉联系，我们要并肩作战，听你指挥。”杨营长又来向副团长报告敌人在反扑。副团长说：“杨庄是第二个张凤集，赶快构筑工事，守！”
    敌人正面的两次反扑都被打退，第二次敌人集中全团所有的轻重火器插进我们占领的几座房子中间，鱼台城里的山炮也连续不断的轰击，各种炮弹手榴弹跟下雨一样，子弹跟刮风一样，从窗户里、从枪眼里、从夹道里、从房檐上呼呼地擦过，房顶揭翻了，院墙倒塌了，地皮砸碎了，十几间房子被烟雾笼罩得昏昏沉沉，加上敌人乱喊乱叫和凄厉的冲锋号，形势很急紧，但战士们仍很镇静的爬在房角上打枪，躺在地下扔手榴弹，打瞎右眼的就用左眼瞄准，端起刺刀和敌人拚命。第六座院子被敌人隔断包围了。敌人很快就反扑到第三座房子，营长、教导员、连长、指导员……，都在一个接一个的扔着手榴弹，他们的脸被火药熏黑了，杨营长喊：“赶快搬炸弹来！”敌人在院子外面大声嚎叫，手榴弹仍旧不停的扔过来，副团长也跑上去送手榴弹，警卫员通讯员都忙着给拉火线，敌人的反扑终于受了挫折。
    早晨八点钟，敌人还要反扑，只剩下三处院子了，副团长找来七个干部向他们严峻的说：“情况就是这样，退是死路一条，我是一个共产党员，你们也是共产党员，我们今天死要死在一起，活要活在一起。杨营长你组织人守这个院子，滕营长你组织人守那个院子，我带人守中间，大家誓死保证不丢一间房子，我要是动摇了你们就枪毙我！”战士听到副团长的命令后说：“对，谁动摇枪毙谁！”工兵们把炸药扎成小包当手榴弹使，机枪手们分头去敌人尸体旁摸子弹，战士们从敌尸上拔下刺刀按到自己的枪上，卫生员扛着步枪给彩号扎绷带，电话员挖开枪眼守住墙角，每个干部都拿上了步枪，六十多个同志各人守在各人的岗位上，院子里除了几个拾子弹找炸弹的再也看不见零散人员和紊乱的景象。“陈参谋你和侦察员通讯员守这个院子。”副团长拿了一支三八式匆匆地走向另一个院子去。
    上午九点钟，敌人的三次反扑都被打退了，但还在准备反扑，张副团长给团长写了一封信说：“我们即使留下一人一枪，决心跟敌人搏斗到底，望你们好好休息，入夜再行作战。”他把信交给两个通讯员说：“赶快送到团部去，打死你，他拿上，打死他，你拿上，两个都打死，这封信就算完了。”通讯员刚跑出村口，第四次反扑就开始了，这一次敌人除增加一批死伤的数目而外，没有占到我们一间房子和一个枪眼。第五次第六次一直到第七次反扑，愈来劲头愈小，敌人软了，战士们吸烟的吸烟，说笑的说笑，有人在帮助卫生员卷绷带，有人在吃敌人丢下的大米饭。现在人们开始感到肚子饿了，瞌睡也来了，敌人的死尸四平八稳的躺在地下，血流到污泥坑里，肮脏的叫人呕心，副团长走到彩号面前，一床一床地给盖着被子，忽然想起被截断在第六座院子里的同志，他问滕营长：“你们都是谁丢在那边了？”滕营长说：“我们二连连长吴永富同志带着七十个人在那边，不过吴永富同志是不会缴枪的，一定牺牲了。”副团长带着几分责备的口气：“你为什么不早报告？”
    吴永富同志还活着。当敌人扑进第六座院子的时候，他提着手枪跳进北屋，对战士们说：“一人拚命，十人难当，听我吴永富指挥。”吴连长的声音简直把子弹炸弹声音都压住了：“窗户打开，机枪架上，给我扫！”哗的一声，院子里六个敌人倒了，其余的扑进东屋。吴连长喊着，十几把刺刀立刻堵住门口，这时在东屋里，我们的同志正和敌人撕杀，机枪封锁的出不了房子，吴连长大喊大叫的支援东屋，东屋里两方面的人都拚光了，敌人又从背后继续反扑，把北屋也点着了，吴连长马上派人往西边打洞，先把彩号搬到西屋，火越烧越大，吴连长指挥战士一个一个转过去，当他钻出洞口的时候，北屋大梁垮了，敌人还在向西屋继续反扑，“同志们，坚决打！只要守到天黑，咱们队伍一定要来的，回去以后我吴永富，保证你们人人当英雄。”十二点钟以后，敌人望着屋子再不敢冲锋。吴连长高声的说：“二排副，你冲出去，看滕营长还在不在。”
    副团长得到吴永富还在坚持搏斗的消息，立即就计划反攻，反攻的关键是夺取路南的一座独立房屋，把连长指导员卫生员等一切能够参加突击的力量都集中起来，掩护的机枪一开火，傅占明端起冲锋枪一跳就跳进院子里，敌人一股劲地向房里逃，傅占明把袖子一撩，手榴弹一个劲的往里扔，后续部队都跟着攻了进来，几十个敌人向一间屋子里挤，几百个炸弹向一个屋子里扔，房顶在塌，脑浆在迸流，“不缴枪统统打死狗日的。”二十三个活人从床底下从死尸下爬出来，哆嗦着当了俘虏。滕营长很快就打到了第六座院子，滕营长见了吴连长，劈头就问：“你们还能不能冲锋？”吴连长说：“能，我们的劲头正上来了。”
    下午三点钟，七个电话员打倒了六个，最后一个终于把线架通，副团长第一次和团长讲话：“不成问题，光我们的力量就能把敌人消灭。”我们的部队从鹤庄高庄……四面合围，在暮色苍茫中一八六团全部覆灭了。
