"We Have Returned to the Real Motherland"
A Record of Liberated Taiwanese Soldiers
Nǎi Yī

More than a thousand Taiwanese compatriots, seized from Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek to serve as cannon fodder in his civil war, were liberated by the Eighth Route Army in the Battle of Yutai. They were all students with at least a high school education, and had worked as laborers and small businessmen. Taiwan was occupied by Japanese invaders for fifty years. These young people in their twenties grew up under the enemy's rule and enslavement, only knowing from their parents and grandparents that "We are Chinese, and China is our motherland." After the Japanese surrendered, Taiwan returned to the motherland, and their decades of hope were realized. But they were quickly disappointed. If you ask them how the Japanese compare to Chiang Kai-shek, they will answer without hesitation: Chiang Kai-shek is even worse than the Japanese. In the past year, the Chiang Kai-shek government has taught them a lesson. Their impression of the KMT army in Taiwan is: "Every family asks for things, defecates everywhere, and banana and tangerine peels are thrown all over the ground." They said, "Since the National Army came, taxes have increased, prices have soared, and more young men have been conscripted. The life of Taiwanese people is even harder than under Japanese rule." Chen Shutang, who was liberated, had five jia (approximately one mu) of land. His two older brothers did business in Hainan Island, and he himself was a businessman at home. During the Japanese rule, his family was still a well-off family with no worries about food and clothing, but after Chiang Kai-shek took over Taiwan and ruled for four months, his family is now in a state of "no food for the next day."

In order to make up for his huge losses in civil war soldiers, Chiang Kai-shek massively conscripted newly liberated Taiwanese youths into the army. After three months of military training, they were incorporated into the 70th Division of the KMT army stationed in Taiwan.

In order to facilitate its control over the army, the KMT army authorities created hatred between the old soldiers and the new Taiwanese soldiers, and incited the old soldiers to treat them with the same attitude as the Japanese treated the Taiwanese compatriots. When Taiwanese soldiers argued with the old KMT soldiers, they were forced to kneel. The old soldiers rode in cars, while the Taiwanese soldiers walked. The salaries and gold rings of the Taiwanese soldiers were taken away by the KMT army for "safekeeping." These poor young men became complete slaves.

In mid-December of last year, the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division of the KMT army was transferred back to the country to participate in the civil war. At that time, the KMT army officers deceived the Taiwanese soldiers, saying, "Shanghai is the largest commercial port in China. You have not been to the motherland. This time, you will land in the motherland for sightseeing." But after landing in Wusong, the first thing they saw was American soldiers. There were many piles of firewood on the dock. When Taiwanese soldiers took firewood to cook, American soldiers opened fire on them. The cars speeding on the road belonged to American soldiers, and they had to give way to Americans on the road. American soldiers took trains without tickets as usual and could bully Chinese soldiers at will... Ye Guorun, a liberated Taiwanese compatriot, said, "At that time, we had run from a Japanese colony to an American colony!"

Three days after landing in Shanghai, they were ordered to go north. As soon as the company commander heard that they were going to fight the Communists, he ran away. The Taiwanese soldiers were sent to Yutai and kept in the dark. After entering the north of Yutai City, they suddenly received the order to "fix bayonets," but the machine guns were already firing. At this time, the KMT army officer said, "We are going to fight bandits." The Eighth Route Army advanced too fiercely, and the Taiwanese compatriots were unwilling to work for Chiang Kai-shek, so they quickly laid down their weapons. They said, "It is too unconscionable for Chinese to fight Chinese. We have been deceived by Chiang Kai-shek!"

In the Eighth Route Army's reception center, Taiwanese compatriot Liao Yuming had a cold. The doctor gave him a careful diagnosis and treatment, and the reception center made him special meals for the sick. He said with tears of gratitude, "I was also sick in Taiwan, but Chiang Kai-shek's officers inhumanly ordered me to carry a machine gun and run on the playground, saying, 'Sweating will cure the disease.' Now we have arrived in the real motherland."

    “我们回到了真正的祖国”
    记被解放的台湾兵
    乃一
    蒋介石由台湾抓来替他当内战炮灰的一千多个台湾同胞，在鱼台战斗中被八路军解放了。他们都是高小以上的学生，当过工人和小商人，台湾被日寇侵占了五十年，这些二十多岁的青年人，在敌人的统治奴役中长大，只是从自己的父母和祖父母的口里知道“我们是中国人，中国是我们的祖国。”日寇投降后，台湾重归祖国，他们几十年的希望实现了。但是马上就又失望了。你问他们日本人比蒋介石怎么样？他们会毫不迟疑的回答：蒋介石比日本人更坏些。一年以来，蒋介石政府给他们上了一课，他们对台湾蒋军的印象是：“家家要东西，到处大小便，香蕉皮桔子皮满地抛。”他们说：“国军来了，捐税也增加了，物价也暴涨了，壮丁抓的更多了。台民的生活比日本人统治时代更苦了。”被解放的陈树堂家种五甲地（相当一亩），两个哥哥在海南岛经商，他自己在家做生意，在日本人统治时代，还是个温饱不愁的小康之家，但在蒋介石接收台湾，统治了四个月后，他家现在已经是“家无隔日粮”了。
    蒋介石为了补救他内战兵员的巨大损失，把刚刚解放的台湾青年大量征抓入伍，经过三个月的军训，就编进了驻台湾的蒋军第七十师。
    蒋军当局为了便利其对军队的控制，就在老兵和台籍新兵之间制造仇恨，教唆老兵以日本人对待台胞的态度对待他们。台湾兵与蒋军老兵吵了嘴，台湾兵要被罚跪，老兵坐车，台湾兵步行，台湾兵的薪饷、金戒指都被蒋军要去“保存”。这些可怜的青年成了十足的奴隶。
    去年十二月中旬，蒋军七十师一四○旅，被调回国投入内战，当时蒋军长官欺骗台湾兵说：“上海是中国第一大商埠，你们没有到过祖国，这次是登陆到祖国观光。”但是在吴淞登陆后，他们第一眼看到的都是美国兵。码头上堆着许多木柴，台湾兵取柴烧饭，美国兵却对他们开了枪。马路上疾驶的汽车是美国兵的，走在路上要为美国让路，美国兵搭乘火车照例免票，可随意欺侮中国兵……。被解放的台湾同胞叶国润说：“我们那时是从日本人的殖民地，跑到美国的殖民地来了”！
    在上海登陆后三天，即奉令北上，连长一听要打共产党就逃跑了，台湾兵却被送到鱼台后，一直被蒙在鼓里。进到鱼台城北，骤然得到“上刺刀”的命令，但机枪已经响了，蒋军军官这时才说：“我们要打土匪”。八路军进得太猛，台胞又不愿为蒋介石卖命，他们很快就放下了武器。他们说：“中国人打中国人太没有良心，我们受了蒋介石的骗！”
    在八路军的招待所里，台胞廖毓明患了感冒，医生给他仔细诊治，招待所给他作病号饭，他感激流涕的说：“我在台湾也生过病，但蒋介石的军官却毫无人心的叫我背上机枪去操场上跑步，说什么：“出了汗病就会好的。”现在我们才是到了真正的祖国了。”
