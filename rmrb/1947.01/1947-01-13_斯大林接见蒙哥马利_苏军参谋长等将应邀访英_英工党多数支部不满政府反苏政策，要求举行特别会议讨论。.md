　　Stalin Receives Montgomery
　　Soviet Chief of Staff and Other Generals to Visit Britain
　　Majority of British Labour Party Branches Dissatisfied with Government's Anti-Soviet Policy, Demanding a Special Meeting for Discussion.

　　[This Newspaper’s News] According to TASS, Moscow, January 11th: Marshal Stalin received British Imperial Chief of the General Staff Marshal Montgomery on January 10th.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan’an, January 10th] Various reports: Montgomery declared on the 8th that he had invited Soviet Chief of the General Staff Marshal Vasilevsky and other Soviet generals to visit Britain in the spring or early summer, and this invitation had been accepted. On the third day of his arrival in Moscow (the 8th), Montgomery visited Marshal Voroshilov, beginning his visits to important Soviet figures. An Associated Press reporter stated that Montgomery's visit would reduce some difficulties in the work of the Four Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting to be held in London in mid-February. The reporter predicted that Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union would discuss military issues in Central Europe, especially the thorny issue of German disarmament, and that if the UK and the Soviet Union could clarify the above issues, it would greatly help the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan’an, January 10th] TASS reported from London on December 27th: The majority of branches of the British Labour Party are demanding a special Labour Party conference to discuss the government's stance on foreign policy. This demand is contained in a memorandum, which contains more rigorous criticism of the government's policies than the questions recently raised in the House of Commons by the so-called "rebellious MPs." The memorandum directly accuses the Labour government of following Churchill's policies, the purpose of which is to organize an extremely anti-Soviet Anglo-American bloc. The memorandum more sharply criticizes Britain's policies towards Poland and other Soviet neighbors, pointing out that Britain's policies everywhere are helping reactionaries. The memorandum believes that Britain's policy of harming cooperation with the Soviet Union in Germany is wrong.

　　斯大林接见蒙哥马利
    苏军参谋长等将应邀访英
  　英工党多数支部不满政府反苏政策，要求举行特别会议讨论。
    【本报讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：斯大林元帅于一月十日，接见英帝国参谋总长蒙哥马利元帅。
    【新华社延安十日电】各方报导：蒙哥马利于八日宣称，他已邀请苏军总参谋长华西列夫斯基元帅及其他苏军将领，于今春或夏初访问英国，此种邀请已被接受。蒙氏到达莫斯科之第三日（八日），访问伏罗希洛夫元帅，开始其对苏联要人之访问。美联社记者称：蒙氏此行将使二月中在伦敦举行的四强外长助理会议的工作，减少若干困难。该记者预料蒙氏访苏中，将谈及中欧军事问题，特别是解除德国军备之棘手问题，而英苏双方如能澄清上述问题，对外长助理会议定有不少帮助。
    【新华社延安十日电】塔斯社十二月二十七日自伦敦报导：大多数英国工党之支部，均要求举行工党特别会议，以讨论政府在外交上之立场。此种要求包含在一备忘录中，此备忘录对政府之政策较最近所谓“叛逆议员”在下院所提出之质问，有更严谨之批评。该备忘录直接指斥工党政府跟随邱吉尔之政策，其目的在于组织一极度仇苏之英美集团。备忘录中更尖锐批评英国对波兰及其他苏联邻国之政策，指出英国在各地之政策均帮助反动分子。备忘录中认为英国在德国危害与苏联合作之政策，实为错误。
