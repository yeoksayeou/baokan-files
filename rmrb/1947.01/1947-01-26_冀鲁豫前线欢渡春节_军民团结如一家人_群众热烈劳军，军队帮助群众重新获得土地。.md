    [Report from Our Jilu豫 Front on the 25th] The Eighth Route Army and local masses on the Jilu豫 Front celebrated the Spring Festival together. The masses in various villages of the recovered Jinxiang County carried cattle, sheep, pork, cabbage, cigarettes, and other items to comfort the Eighth Route Army on New Year's Eve, and they also accused the Chiang Kai-shek army of their crimes to our army. Their consolation letter wrote: "We have been looking forward to it for a long time, and you have finally come. Your contribution is as high as the sky. We swear to be your backing and win more victories." On the morning of New Year's Day, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army held a group worship with the masses stationed in the village. Since the Eighth Route Army recovered the area, it has generally conducted condolences to the masses and helped farmers in Jianglou and other villages to regain the land that was forcibly seized by the evil landlords when the Chiang Kai-shek army invaded. After the democratic government resumed work in Yangshan District, farmers in Zhangzhuang, Hanlou, Wangmiao and other villages also took back their land. The local democratic government is trying to provide relief to military families and disaster-stricken residents.
    [Report from Our Jilu豫 Front on the 25th] After successively annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops Mi Wenhe, Zhang Lanfeng, and other units, the frontline field army and the masses in the vast newly recovered areas south of the Heju Highway celebrated the victory and celebrated the Lunar New Year. On New Year's Eve, a certain unit and its subordinate units held a joint military-civilian celebration meeting at their驻地 and held a banquet to entertain the combat heroes in this battle. A certain regiment captured the most, and specially presented a part of the spoils to the fraternal corps as a New Year's gift. The masses from Jinxiang, Dingtao, Chengwu, Junan and other counties came from afar to comfort the Eighth Route Army. In recent days, it has been snowing heavily, but the market towns of Liulin, Wenshang, Zhangfeng, and Long＠ are still crowded, and those who rush to buy New Year's goods are in an endless stream. Captured Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers are also being transferred to the rear at this time. When Chiang Kai-shek's army reinforced Jinxiang and passed through these villages, they cut down trees, caught chickens, killed pigs and slaughtered sheep, which was extremely barbaric. The folks were happy to see our army commanders and fighters, saying: "As soon as our Eighth Route Army comes over, those harmful bastards will be driven away, and the people will be able to have a good New Year."

    冀鲁豫前线欢渡春节
    军民团结如一家人
    群众热烈劳军，军队帮助群众重新获得土地。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五电】冀鲁豫前线八路军与当地群众欢渡春节。金乡县收复区各村群众，于除夕携带牛羊猪肉白菜纸烟等慰劳八路军，并纷纷向我军控诉蒋军罪行。他们的慰劳信上写道：“盼望了很久，你们终于来了，你们的功劳像天一样高，我们宣誓做你们的后盾，打更多的胜仗。”元旦清晨，某部八路军与驻村群众举行团拜，自八路军收复该地区后，即普遍向群众进行慰问，并帮助姜楼等村农民，把蒋军进犯时恶霸地主倒算去的土地重新夺回。羊山区在民主政府恢复工作后，张庄、韩楼、王庙等村农民亦将土地倒回。对军属及被灾居民，当地民主政府正设法救济中。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五日电】在相继歼灭蒋伪军米文和、张岚峰等部后，前线野战军及荷钜公路以南广大新收复区群众纷纷祝捷，欢庆旧历新年。除夕某部及所属各单位，均于驻地举行军民联合祝捷大会，并设宴招待此次战役中的战斗英雄。某团缴获最多，特将战利品一部赠予兄弟兵团作为新年礼物。金乡、定陶、城武、钜南等县群众纷纷远道赶来慰劳八路军。连日来，瑞雪纷飞，而柳林、汶上、张凤、龙＠等集镇仍拥挤不堪，赶办年货者络绎于途，被俘蒋军官兵亦适于此时向后方转送。蒋军向金乡增援经过这一带村庄时，砍树捉鸡，杀猪宰羊，横蛮至极，老乡见了我军指战员都高兴地说：“咱八路军一过来，打走那些害人的王八蛋，老百姓也能好好过年了。”
