　　In Memory of Comrade Wangmei
　　Lu Guang, Shou Lun, Xian De
　　Comrade Liu Wangmei was twenty-four years old this year. She was a female comrade who was educated, cultivated, and retained by the underground party in Meng County for seven years. Over the past seven years, she has used all her enthusiasm, wisdom, and perseverance, braving countless dangers to work for the Party. Now, unfortunately, she has passed away due to illness. All the comrades who knew her feel infinite grief and consider it a loss for our Party and the people.

　　Comrade Wangmei lost her mother in her childhood and was married off at a very young age, living the life of a child bride. The cruelty of her mother-in-law, the naivety of her husband, and the miserable life deprived her of the warmth of life. This summer, when we were writing her autobiography for her, she cried and said: "Except for the Party, I will never tell anyone that I was slapped in the face by my mother-in-law several times..." Indeed, the past ten years of Comrade Wangmei's life were soaked in tears. It was this that planted her extreme resentment towards the old society and her unparalleled enthusiasm for the Party and comrades.

　　Comrade Wangmei learned about the Party when she was in complete despair, and since then, she has had the joy of life. In the beginning, when her sister secretly went out to work in the middle of the night, in the freezing cold of winter, she would watch at the door all night. In order not to let her family know, she put a broom in the quilt to pretend she was sleeping, and often practiced lifting the bottom of the door with her hands, so that opening and closing the door would not make a sound. She lived this way for a year before she officially joined the Party. When the environment was tense, the underground party in Meng County relied entirely on Comrade Wangmei to transmit the only eight-sound pistol back and forth at the risk of danger for the sake of work. Last spring, when the Eighth Route Army was active in Meng County, she often waited all night in the graveyard outside the village to contact the comrades of the troops. Later, when the situation became tense and the troops could not come down, she pretended to be visiting relatives and sent letters alone to the Northwest Ridge, which she had never been to. Comrade Wangmei was originally in poor health and very timid, but in her work, she showed amazing courage and infinite joy.

　　Because of work, she often didn't sleep all night. At dawn, she still had to work in the fields with her family. The comrades all said, "She has put all her energy into the cause of the Party." It is really not easy for a rural woman to be able to do this!

　　During the great famine in Meng County, the people fled in all directions. The superiors told her to persevere in her work, but the people in her mother's family and her husband's family wanted to flee the famine. What should she do? Comrade Wangmei pretended to be sick and stayed in bed, so she stayed at home alone during the famine year, eating elm bark noodles and starving to persist in her work. This spring, her brother from her mother's family made a fortune outside and came back to take her to enjoy happiness. Because of work needs, she did not go. Later, her father came back to pick her up twice, and she scared him by saying: "You can swim, the Eighth Route Army said you often transport assassination teams across the river and want to arrest you, hurry up and leave." Her father left, and Comrade Wangmei worked smoothly for the Party at home, because her father was doing his best to oppose her participation in the revolution.

　　After joining the Party, Comrade Wangmei also worked very hard in her studies. During her underground secret work, she would often do needlework while secretly learning new characters after the whole family was asleep, and finally learned to use new characters to communicate with other comrades. This summer, Comrade Wangmei participated in the district farmers' association work group and still took time to learn to read. She said: "It is really difficult to do work without knowing how to read. I was at a meeting in Tianzhang, electing combat models, and people suggested a lot of names, but I couldn't remember them. I had no choice but to pull the village farmers' association director aside and ask him to write down a list for me. Oh! It was really embarrassing..." Even when she was sick, she did not forget to study. In early October, at the mobilization meeting for expanding the army in Tianzhang, she was sick and unable to get out of bed, but she kept saying: "You work all day and all night, but I am lying in bed doing nothing, what's the use?" Once in the middle, she was so anxious that she went for a while with a cane, and came back so tired that she slept for two days. Her desire to improve is very worthy of study.

　　On October 12th, because the situation was tense, Comrade Wangmei was sent to the mountains. For two months, her condition was sometimes good and sometimes bad. We often said we would go up the mountain to see her, but work always kept us busy, and we were finally unable to say a word of comfort to her before she died. I never thought that our separation in Tianzhang would be a final farewell!

　　Comrade Wangmei: You once lived for the Party and the people, but today, you have left us. Your boundless enthusiasm and courage for the cause of the Party will forever live in the hearts of the comrades!

　　记望梅同志
    路光　守伦　先德
    刘望梅同志，今年二十四岁，是孟县地下党七年中教育、培养和保留下来的一个女同志。七年来她用尽了自己的热诚、智慧和毅力，冒着无数危险为党工作，现在不幸病故了，凡是认识她的同志，都感到无限的悲痛，认为是我们党和人民的损失。
    望梅同志幼年丧失母亲，又很小出嫁，过着童养媳的生活，婆婆的严酷，丈夫的憨傻、凄楚的生活，使她失掉了人生的温暖，今夏我们代她写自传时，她哭着说：“除了党我永不会对人说出：我几次的挨过婆母的耳光……”的确，望梅同志已往十几年的生活，是用眼泪浸成的，正是这才种下她对旧社会的极度愤恨，与对党对同志无比的热诚。
    望梅同志就是在一切绝望的时候，才知道了党的，从此以后，她才有人生的乐趣。起初，她姐姐半夜偷着出去工作时，十冬腊月天，她整夜在门口守望着，为了不使家人知道，她在被窝里放着扫帚，进行伪装，也经常练习用手抬着门底，因此，不论开门关门，都不会发出一点声音，这样生活过了一年，她正式入了党。环境紧张时，孟县地下党为了工作，仅有的一支八音手枪，全靠望梅同志冒着危险来回的传递着。去年春天，八路军活动到孟县时，她常常整夜整夜在村外坟地里等候着和部队同志联络，后来形势紧张，部队不能下来，她几次装着串亲戚，独自向她从未去过的西北岭上送信。望梅同志本来身体不好，并且最胆小，可是在工作中，她却表现着惊人的勇敢，和无限的愉快。
    因为工作常常一夜不睡。天明了，仍得和家人一块上地做活，同志们都说：“她已经把一切精力放在党的事业上了。”一个农村妇女能够如此，实在是不易呀！
    在孟县大灾荒时，人民四下逃生，上级叫她坚持工作，可是娘家和婆家的人都要向外逃荒，怎么办呢？望梅同志就装病不起，以致灾荒年中一个人在家，吃着榆皮面，饿着肚子坚持工作，今年春娘家哥在外边闹阔了，回来接她去享福，因为工作需要，她没有去，以后她父亲二次回来接她，她吓唬他说：“你会浮水，八路军说你常运暗杀队过河，要抓你，赶快走吧。”父亲走了，望梅同志在家顺利的为党工作，因为她父亲是竭力反对她参加革命的。
    望梅同志入党以后，学习也很努力，在地下秘密工作时，每每在全家人睡觉后，一面做针线，一面偷着学习新文字，终于学会了用新文字和其他同志通信，今年夏天望梅同志参加区农会工作组，仍是不间断的抽空学认字，她说：“做工作，不识字，真是为难，我在田丈开会，选举参战模范，人家提了一大堆名字，我记不住，没法，只好把村农会主任拉到一边，请人家给我记下一个名单，呀！真是丢死人啦……”就是在病中，她都没有忘记学习，十月初，在田丈开扩军动员大会，她病着不能起床，但还念念不休的说：“你们整天整夜工作，我却躺在床上不动，有啥用呢？”中间有一回急的不行，拄着棍子去了一会，回来累的睡了两天，她的上进心是很值得学习的。
    十月十二日因为形势紧张，才把望梅同志送到山上，两个月来病势时好时坏，我们常说上山看看她，但工作总是离不开，终于没有能在她死以前说一句安慰话，想不到田丈一别，竟成为永别！
    望梅同志：你曾经为党为人民而活着，今天，你却离开了我们而去，你对党的事业的无限热诚和勇敢，将永远活在同志们的心里！
