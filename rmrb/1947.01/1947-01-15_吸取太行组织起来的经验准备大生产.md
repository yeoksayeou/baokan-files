　　Absorb the Experience of Organizing in Taihang to Prepare for Large-Scale Production

In the next two days, this newspaper will successively publish the summary report by Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the Taihang District Party Committee, at the Second Congress of Heroes and Model Workers. From the third issue of this report, regarding the large-scale production movement, we clarified a very important concept: organizing production not only enables the people to move from poverty to prosperity, achieving consolidated and thorough emancipation, but also solves all material and human difficulties brought about by war and famine, laying a solid foundation for carrying out various tasks and striving for victory in the self-defense war. In the past few years, there have been many experiences in the production movement in the Taihang area that are worth our study and absorption.

First, the production movement in the Taihang area was launched on the basis of rent reduction in 1942 and thorough investigation and rent reduction in 1944. Facts have proved that the masses' full enthusiasm for production is only possible on the basis of thorough emancipation. At present, the whole region has carried out or is carrying out land reform. Organizing production on the basis of completing land reform will face fewer obstacles. However, one point must be noted: establishing the idea that peasants organize production to plant the roots of wealth is still a very important educational process. The experience of various places in Taihang has suggested that the peasants' understanding of organizing in the beginning is often very complicated. For example, some are unwilling to participate in mutual aid, some want to take advantage in the mutual aid groups, and others think that participating in mutual aid means suffering losses. ... Without seriously solving these ideological problems, the mutual aid movement is difficult to carry out. In the process of ideological education, it is also very important to combine it with establishing correct ideas about organizing.

Second, the goal of organizing in various parts of Taihang is to achieve "cultivating three and having a surplus of one." The results achieved in 1946, due to combining agriculture with sideline production and paying attention to intensive cultivation, many counties achieved it, especially Ping Shun, a county known for its poor soil. The main reason for this is that the problem of organizing in agriculture was solved in 1944, the problem of organizing sidelines was solved in the winter production of 1945, and the integration of agriculture and sidelines was solved in 1946, and attention was paid to improving agricultural technology. When absorbing this experience, various places should refer to their own work base and local production conditions. Generally, they should first start with agriculture as the main focus, gain experience, and then develop sidelines.

Third, the goal of organizing should include all full and semi-labor forces and auxiliary labor forces. This is extremely important for supporting the war, but attention must be paid to starting with breakthroughs in individual cases, otherwise it is easy to develop formalism.

Fourth, the process of organizing is the process of combining with the demands of the masses. Taihang has followed the same path in various organizations in agriculture, sideline production, and the textile industry. If we do not pay attention to organizing according to the needs of the masses, the organization will inevitably fail. Therefore, whether it is agriculture or sideline production, participation in mutual aid must be voluntary and attention must be paid to equivalent exchange. Only in this way can the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses be continuously exerted, continuously overcome difficulties, and achieve new experiences.

The above four points cannot summarize all the experiences of Taihang. They are only presented as a reference for everyone to study the experiences of Taihang in light of local conditions.

### 吸取太行组织起来的经验准备大生产

　　吸取太行组织起来的经验准备大生产
    今明两日本报将陆续发表太行区党委赖若愚同志在二届群英大会上的总结报告，从这个报告之第三个问题：关于大生产运动中，使我们明确了一个很重要的观念：组织起来生产，不仅能使人民由贫苦走向富裕，获得巩固与彻底的翻身，而且解决了因战争、灾荒所带来的一切物资与人力的困难，为开展各种工作，争取自卫战争的胜利，打下了巩固的基础。几年来太行区的生产运动中，有不少经验，是值得我们研究与吸取的。
    第一、太行区的生产运动是在四二年减租，四四年彻底查减的基础上开展起来的，事实曾经证明，群众饱满的生产热情，是在彻底翻身的基础上才有可能发扬起来。目前全区都已进行或正在进行土地改革，在完成土地改革的基础上组织生产，障碍将会更少。但有一点必须注意：即树立农民组织起来生产栽富根的思想，还是一个很重要的教育过程。太行各地经验都曾提示过，农民对组织起来的了解在一开头，往往很复杂，如有的不愿参加互助，有的想在互助组中沾点便宜，还有的认为参加互助就是要吃亏。……不认真解决这些思想问题，互助运动很难开展起来，各地在进行思想教育中，结合树立正确的组织起来的观念还很重要。
    第二、太行各地组织起来的奋斗目标是实现耕三余一，一九四六年做的结果，由于结合农业开展了副业生产，并注意了精耕细作，有不少县份是实现了，特别像平顺这样五行素称的县份也做到了耕三余一。这当中主要的道理是四四年解决了农业方面的组织起来的问题，四五年冬季生产中解决了副业的组织问题，四六年两面碰头，解决了农副结合，并注意了提高农业技术。各地在吸取这一经验时应参照自己的工作基础与当地的生产条件，一般的还应首先从农业为主入手，取得经验，发展副业。
    第三、组织起来的目标应包括所有全半劳力及辅助劳力，这对支援战争讲，关系极重要，但须注意从突破个别入手，否则极易发展形式主义。
    第四、组织起来的过程，就是与群众要求相结合的过程。太行在农副业、纺织业各种组织起来上，都是走了同一的道路，如不注意按群众需要组织，其组织必然落空。因此无论农业副业都好，参加互助的，一定是自愿结合，并注意等价交换，只有这样，群众的积极性和创造性才能不断发挥，不断克服困难取得新的经验。
    以上四点，并不能概括太行全部经验，仅提出作为大家结合本地情况研究太行经验的一点参考。
