    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] Qinyuan conducted a final inspection of the county's implementation of "land to the tiller" and discovered that many mountain villages and forts still had a considerable number of peasants who had not yet turned over. The mountain villages and forts in Qinyuan are mostly inhabited by outsiders who cultivate mountain slopes. The soil on the mountain slopes is thin, and after years of rain erosion, yields have decreased daily, leading to impoverished lives. Landlords who rent out mountain land mostly reside in large villages and have already been dealt with during the movement's climax. Furthermore, clan influences have led to local discrimination against outsiders. As a result, they have not participated in the struggle. Secondly, mountain villages are scattered, making them difficult to organize. Education is scarce, and their awareness is slow to develop. For example, in the mountain villages belonging to the pilot village of Beixingzhuang, such as Nanming, Gaojiayu, Jingfeng, Lihe, and Rujiazhuang, the policy of "land to the tiller" has not yet been realized. In Majiayu's Pangjiagou, there are still thirty peasant households without land and fourteen households with insufficient land. In Juyinzhuang's Hujiagou and Hongyashang, there are still six households without land and twelve households with insufficient land. In the mountain villages of Jingfeng and Lihe, peasants have historically lived in marginal areas and have not experienced significant struggles, resulting in poor awareness and control by feudal forces, making them afraid to boldly speak out and settle accounts. For example, Duan Gou Xiao's accounting with landlord Feng Zhaoyu did not recover the land. Similar situations in the aforementioned mountain villages and forts are still prevalent. Currently, leaders are being dispersed to provide in-depth leadership in the struggle.

    沁源保证贫苦农民获得土地
    深入发动山庄窝铺
    【本报太岳二十七日电】沁源最后检查全县实行耕者有其田情形，发现很多山庄窝铺尚有不少未翻身的农民。该县山庄窝铺多系外来户，耕种的是山坡地，山地土薄，经数年雨水冲洗后，产量日减，生活贫穷，出租山地的地主多居大村，在运动高潮中已被搞完，又加宗派影响本地人排外，因此他们尚有未参加斗争的。其次山庄居住分散，不易组织，教育很少，觉悟迟缓，如北幸庄基点村所属之南明、高家峪、景凤、黎和、汝家庄等六个村子的山庄，仍未实现耕者有其田。马家峪的庞家沟还有三十户农民无地，十四户少地，具寅庄的胡家沟、红崖上尚有六户无地，十二户少地，景凤与黎和两村山庄窝铺，农民因一向居边沿区，未曾经过大的斗争，觉悟很差，被封建势力统治着，不敢大胆诉苦清算，如段狗小与地主冯昭玉算账，就未算回土地。类似上述山庄窝铺的情形尚多，现在正分散领导人员深入领导斗争。
