[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Central Bureau, Border Region Government, Military Region Headquarters, and Political Department recently sent a telegram to wounded and sick comrades in the troops and schools of the Jiluyu Front and various military region columns, the 17th Division, and the Military and Political University, expressing condolences and extending New Year's greetings. The original telegram is as follows:

Dear wounded and sick comrades:

In this sacred patriotic self-defense war, you have demonstrated a great spirit of heroism and sacrifice. Some have been gloriously wounded, and some have become sick from overwork. The people of the whole country admire you, and the brothers on the front lines miss you. Because we want to concentrate our strength to persist in the overall struggle, first of all to use the greatest strength to support the war on the front lines and expand the results of your bloodshed, in many places we have not taken good care of you, and have not often come to comfort and care for you. I think you will certainly be able to understand this. Now, the annual but particularly tense New Year is coming again. The new tasks of struggle that come with the New Year have been seriously placed on our shoulders. Looking back on the brilliant achievements of the past year, everyone is truly grateful to you. This is the heroic achievement you have created with your own lives and blood. Under the awards of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we share the glory! Looking forward to the increasingly approaching prospect of victory, we feel infinite excitement and are determined to make every effort to win a comprehensive victory! As you recuperate in the quiet hospital, you will certainly think of many questions, especially hoping that you will think about: What kind of time did you live in the past? And what kind of time are you living in now? What kind of time will we live after we defeat Chiang Kai-shek? It is very clear that if we do not defeat Chiang Kai-shek, our Liberated Areas will not be able to live a good life; as long as we defeat Chiang Kai-shek, the people of the whole of China can live a good life. In the future, when the people of the whole country live a good life, everyone will always be grateful to you! Through this half-year of self-defense war, we have annihilated more than 40 divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, captured nearly a hundred of his generals alive, making his forces even more insufficient and his morale even lower; and we are getting stronger and stronger in battle, and have already occupied a dominant position on many battlefields, and then we will prepare for a major counter-offensive to recover all lost territories. We hope that you will take good care of yourselves, recover soon, return to the troops, return to the front line to participate in the victorious counter-offensive, and make more contributions! At the beginning of this New Year, everyone is rejoicing and welcoming the victorious 1947. We don't have anything good to give you as a New Year's gift. We can only strengthen our struggle in all aspects, do all our work well, and do our best to support the front line, so that the front line can win a few more battles and annihilate a few more divisions of the Chiang army as a New Year's gift! In addition, we also comfort you - wounded and sick comrades with 500 Jibi yuan each, please accept it with a smile! I wish you a happy New Year! Good health!

　　中央局、边府暨军区  电慰部队伤病员同志
    祝他们早愈再建功劳
    【本报特讯】中央局、边区政府、军区司令部及政治部顷致电冀鲁豫前方及各军区纵队、十七师、军政大学等部队、学校伤病员同志，表示慰问并祝贺新年，原电如下：亲爱的伤病员同志：
    在此次神圣的爱国自卫战争中，你们表现了伟大的英勇牺牲精神，有的光荣负伤，有的积劳成病，全国的人民都仰慕你们，前线的弟兄们都怀念你们。我们因为要集中力量坚持全面斗争，首先是用最大的力量去支持前线的战争，扩大你们流血所得的战果，许多地方对你们便照顾得不周到，没有经常来慰问你们、看护你们，这一点想你们一定能够体谅的。现在一年一度的但是特别紧张的新年又来了，随着新年而来的新斗争任务，已严重的放在我们的肩头，回顾过去一年的辉煌战绩，大家对你们实在有说不出的感激，这是你们用自己的生命和血汗创造的英雄业迹，在毛主席和朱总司令的奖励下，我们同感光荣！瞻望日益接近的胜利前途，我们更感到无限的兴奋，决心尽一切努力来争取全面的胜利！你们在清静的医院里休养，一定会想到许多问题，特别希望你们思想：以前过的是什么时光？而今过的是什么时光？我们打垮了蒋介石又将要过什么时光？很明白的，不打垮蒋介石就是我们解放区也过不成好时光；只要打垮了蒋介石，全中国的老百姓都可以过好时光。将来全国老百姓过好时光时，大家对你们是永远感激不忘的！经过这半年来的自卫战争，我们已歼灭了蒋介石四十师以上的部队，活捉他将官近百名，使他的兵力更加不够，士气更加低落；而我们都是越战越强，已经在许多战场上占据了主动的地位，接着就要准备收复一切失地的大反攻了。希望你们好好休养，早日痊愈，回到部队，重上前线参加胜利的反攻，再建立更多的功劳！在这新年当头，大家都在欢欣鼓舞迎接胜利的一九四七年，我们没有什么好的东西给你们作贺礼，只有加强我们各面的斗争，把一切工作做好，尽力支援前线，使前线上再多打几个胜仗，再多歼灭蒋军几个师，作为新年的献礼！此外，并慰劳你们——伤病员同志每人冀钞五百元，请笑纳！敬祝新年愉快！身体健康！
