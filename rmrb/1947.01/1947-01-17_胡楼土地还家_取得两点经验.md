　　Hulou Land to the Tillers: Two Experiences Gained
    [Report from Jilu Yu Border Region, 15th] In Hulou, Yanggu, land reform is being implemented, and two experiences have been gained. Hulou is a village of more than 230 households. Last autumn, it carried out a "tenant-laborer movement." Only more than 20 tenant-laborer families and some poor peasants improved their lives, and most of the middle peasants did not participate in the peasant association. Since the beginning of the self-defense war, the landlords in the village have been active, and individual peasant association members have secretly returned the rent-reduced grain to the landlords. This time, in promoting land reform, the district concentrated the local despotic landlords for training, which forced the saboteurs to lower their heads. Although the poor peasants were very happy, they were still a little timid and willing to "feel the ground," especially the middle peasants who were uneasy. In response to this situation, a village-wide "feeling the ground" meeting was held. At the meeting, the policy of eliminating feudalism and "land to the tillers" was explained, and the attitude of resolutely supporting the masses was expressed. The middle peasants were relieved, and the enthusiasm of the poor peasant members was even higher. On the one hand, they actively expanded new members, and on the other hand, they carried out ideological deliberations in the peasant association groups to organize how to settle accounts with the local despotic landlords. When settling accounts with the local despot Hu Bingzhen, more than 600 people spoke out to reason and complain. After the struggle was successful, more than 70 middle peasants joined the peasant association that day. Two experiences have been gained from the work in the village: First, in a situation of long-term fatigue and depression in the work, one should break through the depressed situation at the beginning and not overemphasize that action should be taken after the majority is organized. When the activists dare to take the lead, and the majority of the masses are willing to do it but still have some concerns and wait-and-see attitudes, it is best to quickly organize the struggle. After the victory, one can seize the opportunity to vigorously develop members, carry out organizational education, and prepare for another new struggle. Second, organizing typical complaints before the struggle is an important task. In the struggle against the local despot Hu Bingzhen, Hu Binglong's family complained. Full deliberations were made in advance, and the three members of the family cried bitterly and reasoned at the struggle meeting, which had a great effect on the class education of the masses.

　　胡楼土地还家  取得两点经验
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】阳谷胡楼推行土地改革，并取得两点经验。胡楼是一个二百三十余户的村庄，去年秋后曾进行过一次“佃雇运动”，全村只二十余家佃雇和一部分贫农改善了生活，大部中农没参加农会。自卫战争开始，该村地主大肆活动，个别农会员把减租粮偷偷送还地主。这次推行土地改革，区里把恶霸地主集中训练，使破坏分子低了头。贫农虽很高兴，但还有点不大胆，愿意“摸摸底”，特别是中农情绪不安。针对这种情况，召开了全村的“摸底”大会，会上讲了消灭封建“土地还家”的政策，表明坚决为群众撑腰的态度。中农放了心，贫农会员的情绪更高了，一面积极扩大新会员，一面便在农会小组里进行思想酝酿，组织如何清算恶霸地主。清算恶霸胡秉震时，六百多人讲理诉苦，斗争胜利后，当天有七十多个中农参加了农会。由该村工作中得到两点经验：在工作长期疲塌消沉情况下，开始应突破消沉局面，不必过分强调多数组织起来以后再行动。当积极分子敢领头，大部分群众愿意干而尚有所顾虑观望时，最好迅速组织斗争，胜利后可抓紧机会大力发展会员，进行组织教育，准备再一次新斗争。二、斗争前组织典型诉苦是重要的工作，对恶霸胡秉震的斗争，胡秉龙全家诉苦，事前充分作了酝酿，在斗争会上全家三口痛哭讲理，对群众阶级教育作用很大。
