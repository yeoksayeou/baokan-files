Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. Under American support, Japanese goods are making a comeback and beginning to flood the market. The Ta Kung Pao reported on December 26th that, in addition to over 5,000 bales of cotton yarn being shipped to Hong Kong, shipments have recently been permitted by the Nanjing authorities for sale in Shanghai. Other cotton yarn, toys, and chemical products are expected to arrive in a steady stream. The report stated that the Japanese textile industry plans to increase production in 1947, exceeding Japan's domestic needs. It is predicted that under Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous civil war and the dumping of American goods, the future of Chinese industry is even more bleak. Furthermore, according to the Peiping World Daily on the 1st, the production of major Japanese goods has increased by 370% in the past year. After MacArthur permitted free trade in Japanese goods, Japanese goods have gradually entered the Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.

　　美国扶植下日货卷土重来
    大批棉纱运销沪港
    【新华社延安十六日电】在美国扶植下日本货卷土重来，开始倾流。大公报上月二十六日载称：除棉纱五千余包运港外，最近经南京当局允可，已运沪倾销，其他棉纱玩具化学用品即可源源而来。该报称：日本纺织工业预备在一九四七年增加生产量，超过日本本国所需，预料在蒋介石卖国内战与美货倾销下，中国工业之前途更不堪设想。又据北平世界日报一日载，日本一年来主要货物的生产已增加百分之三百七十。在麦克阿瑟准许日货自由贸易后，日本货已逐渐进入中国及南洋市场。
