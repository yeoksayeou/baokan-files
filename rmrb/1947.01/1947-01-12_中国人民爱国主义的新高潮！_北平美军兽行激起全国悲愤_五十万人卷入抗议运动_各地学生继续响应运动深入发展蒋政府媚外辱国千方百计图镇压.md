Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th—The national student movement protesting American military atrocities and demanding the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China has continued for more than ten days since December 29th. Students directly and indirectly involved in the movement number over 500,000, with nearly 100,000 personally participating in marches. The movement encompasses major cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuhan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. Chinese public opinion regards it as a new "December 9th Movement" and a new high tide of patriotism among the Chinese people. Now, the movement has generally transitioned from demonstrations and marches to a sustained struggle. Students on strike in various regions, while ending the marches and temporarily resuming classes, declared that they will continue this movement until the Beiping atrocity case is thoroughly resolved and all American troops withdraw from China. Students in Beiping and Tianjin have successively established a joint committee to protest American military atrocities, responsible for presiding over future movement affairs. The Shanghai University Student Union has also designated the 6th to the 12th as "Protest Week," uniting all sectors of Shanghai to launch a larger-scale movement to withdraw American troops. The roar of "Cannot Endure It Anymore," "We Cannot Allow Compatriots to be Trampled," "Chinese People Will Not Be Slaves of America," "Severely Punish the American Murderers," and "American Troops Get Out of China" has shaken the entire China. Students in Nanjing clearly stated in their appeal to students: "America regards the Chinese people as grass, disregards Chinese sovereignty, and commits atrocities everywhere, leaving bloodstains everywhere. The Chinese people have long opposed the stationing of American troops in China." The declaration of the Shanghai University Student Union loudly proclaimed: "Oppose the American military coming to China, which violates national independence and freedom." Students in Tianjin shouted: "We are prepared to strike and sacrifice to protest the brutal behavior of the American military in Beiping."

The student protest movement has received support and assistance from various domestic democratic organizations and fair-minded individuals. The Democratic League, the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference, Shanghai celebrities, scholars, writers, the China Women's Federation, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Sojourners' Association in Shanghai, and the Chinese press, except for the Central News Agency and Kuomintang official newspapers, have all expressed sympathy. Professor Ma Yinchu particularly pointed out: "The Chinese government should be responsible for this matter. Is the current government the government of the Chinese people or the government of the Americans? If it is the government of the Chinese people, it should immediately lodge a protest and make serious representations; otherwise, please step down." Mr. Ma personally participated in the Shanghai student march. The vast majority of professors in Beiping universities sympathized with the students' just actions. Ninety-nine percent of professors and teaching assistants at Tsinghua University supported the strike protest, and ninety percent supported demonstrations. More than twenty presidents, professors, and teaching assistants from Nanjing schools participated in the march. More than ten professors from Central China University in Wuhan expressed their opinions, demanding the withdrawal of American troops. Citizens in major cities also supported the students, and many citizens were moved to tears by the students' propaganda. Many citizens, shop assistants, civil servants, bosses, and even many soldiers in military uniforms in Beiping and Tianjin automatically joined the march. The student protest movement was also supported by some foreign fair-minded individuals. Many American professors in Wuhan and Beiping also expressed sympathy for the students.

Only the Kuomintang authorities, with their slavish mentality, suppressed and sabotaged the just and patriotic student movement. The Beiping Kuomintang authorities prohibited newspapers from publishing news of the American military atrocities in Beiping, and Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered "the suppression of all news related to this matter." The Executive Yuan further denounced the student protest movement as "xenophobic" in its public orders and explicitly forbade "insulting friendly nations." The mayor of Beiping, He Siyuan, issued a shameless statement that the victim's "hymen was not completely broken." The Beiping Police Bureau, after Miss Shen was raped by American soldiers, continued to beat her and even considered it "consensual intercourse," fabricating rumors to insult Miss Shen's reputation. The Beiping authorities instigated more than 300 armed special agent students to sabotage the student protest movement in Beiping. Special agent students in Tianjin specifically tore down student protest slogans. Kuomintang military police in Nanjing even opened fire on student petition representatives. Shanghai police openly charged into Jinan University with bayonets fixed and a light machine gun attached. According to news from Nanjing, the Kuomintang authorities have dispatched a large number of personnel to Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing to sabotage the student protest movement. These are the shameless actions of the Kuomintang authorities in this student patriotic protest movement.

    中国人民爱国主义的新高潮！
    北平美军兽行激起全国悲愤
    五十万人卷入抗议运动
  　各地学生继续响应运动深入发展蒋政府媚外辱国千方百计图镇压
    【新华社延安十日电】全国学生抗议美军暴行，要求撤退驻华美军运动，自十二月二十九日以来，已持续十数日，间接直接卷入运动的学生，在五十万以上，亲身加入游行行列者亦近十万人。运动范围包括北平、天津、上海、南京、苏州、杭州、镇江、武汉、重庆、广州及香港等各大都市，中国舆论界评为新的“一二九”，中国人民爱国主义的新高潮。现在运动一般已从示威游行形式，进入持久性的斗争，各地罢课学生，在结束游行，暂行复课之际宣称：将继续此一运动，直至北平暴行案彻底解决，所有美军退出中国为止。平津学生已先后成立抗议美军暴行联合委员会，负责主持今后运动事宜。上海大学学生联合会，复定六日至十二日为“抗议周”，联合沪市各界展开更大规模之撤退美军运动。“不能忍受了”，“我们不能任同胞受蹂躏”，“中国人不作美国的奴隶”，“严惩美军凶手”，“美军退出中国去”的怒吼，震动了全中国。南京学生在其告学生书中讲得明白：“美国视中国人民为草芥，置中国主权于罔闻，暴行处处，血迹斑斑，中国人民早已反对美军驻华”。上海市大学学生联合会的宣言，大声疾呼：“反对违犯民族独立自由的美军来华”。天津学生高呼：“我们准备罢课和不惜牺牲抗议强暴的美军在北平的兽行”。
    学生抗议运动获得国内各民主社团及各公正人士的支持和援助，民主同盟、上海人民团体联合会、上海各名流、学者、作家，中国妇女联谊会，港九旅沪联合会，以及除中央社和国民党官报以外的中国新闻界等均表同情。马寅初教授特别指出：“对于这件事情，中国政府应该负责，现在的政府到底是中国人的政府，还是美国人的政府？假如是中国人的政府，应该迅即提出抗议，严重交涉，否则请滚下台去”。马氏并亲自参加上海学生游行。平市各大学绝大多数教授同情学生正义行动，清华大学教授助教百分之九十九均赞成罢课抗议，百分之九十赞成游行示威。南京各学校的校长、教授、助教二十余人的参加游行，武汉华中大学教授十余人发表意见，要求美军撤退，各大都市市民亦均赞助学生，有很多市民为学生宣传而感流泪。平津很多市民、店员、公务员、老板甚至很多穿军服的士兵，都自动参加游行行列。学生抗议运动也为一些外国公正人士所支持，武汉和北平许多美籍教授也对学生表示同情。
    唯有奴才成性的国民党当局，才对正义的学生爱国运动加以压制和破坏，北平国民党当局禁止各报刊布北平美军暴行新闻，蒋介石又亲下令“压制一切有关此事消息”。行政院更在其公开命令中斥学生抗议运动为“排外”，还明令不得“损污友邦”，北平市长何思源发表被奸者“处女膜未十分破”的无耻声明，北平警察局在沈小姐被美军强奸后又继以殴打，甚至认为“和奸”，并造出侮辱沈小姐名誉之谣言，平市当局唆使三百余武装特务学生，破坏平市学生抗议运动。天津特务学生专门撕毁学生抗议标语，南京国民政府宪兵竟对学生请愿代表开枪，上海警察公然枪上刺刀，并附轻机枪一挺冲入暨南大学。据南京消息，国民党当局且已派遣大批人员赴沪、汉、渝各地破坏学生抗议运动。这些就是国民党当局在这次学生爱国抗议运动的无耻行动。
