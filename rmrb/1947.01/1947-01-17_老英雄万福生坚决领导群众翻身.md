[Report from the headquarters in the border region of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan on the 15th] Wan Fusheng, the vice chairman of the farmers' association in Xinjizhen, Linze, is nearly sixty years old but still strong. In the past, he made a living by watching crops, collecting manure, and doing odd jobs. After the establishment of the democratic government, he became a trader in the market, and his life improved. After the establishment of the village farmers' association, he became an activist among the six or seven hundred members. After the outbreak of the Self-Defense War, he led the masses to overthrow the landlords. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded near Xinji, the evil landlords sent a hired worker and a tenant farmer to tie him up, but the hired worker and tenant farmer told Wan Fusheng to hide. This was because Wan Fusheng had led them to reduce rent in the past. Upon hearing this news, Wan Fusheng immediately told his wife to stay at home and went to the district joint defense team as a scout. He was very happy, running dozens of miles every day to scout out the situation, never complaining of fatigue. Later, his wife was captured by the "Homecoming Corps," but he did not waver and encouraged the militiamen to fight resolutely. He persisted until the enemy was driven away before victoriously returning to his village to continue working as usual.

　　老英雄万福生坚决领导群众翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】临泽辛集镇副农会长万福生，已年近六十，但身体强壮。过去靠看青、拾粪、打短工过活，民主政府建立后，当了集上的交易员，从此生活就改善了。村农会成立后，他成为六七百农会员中的积极分子。自卫战争爆发后，他们领导群众翻身。当蒋军进犯至辛集附近时，坏蛋地主就派了个雇工和一个佃户去捆他，雇工佃户却告诉了万福生让他躲避。因为万福生在过去领导他们减过租。万福生听到这消息后，马上叫老婆留在家里，自己到区联防队当了侦察员，他很高兴，每天跑几十里路去侦察情况，从不说疲劳。后来老婆被“还乡团”捕起来，他毫不动摇，并鼓励民兵们坚决干。他一直坚持到敌人被打跑，才胜利的回到自己的村里照常工作。
