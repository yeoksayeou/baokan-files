Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. According to reports from Shanghai: The Shanghai China Women's Association and the Shanghai Women's Association held a New Year's Eve party on the 29th of last month. More than 100 people attended, including Liu Wang Li Ming, Hu Ziying, and Xu Guangping. During the meeting, they discussed the atrocities of American soldiers in Beiping, conscription, and the constitution. They unanimously expressed their firm demand for the withdrawal of American troops, opposition to the Kuomintang authorities' conscription to fight the civil war, and opposition to the Chiang Kai-shek clique's one-party "constitution." Xu Guangping said: "The whole country is angry about the rape of female students by American soldiers in Beiping. How can we women not be angry when we see our sisters being insulted! At the same time, the national conscription order has been issued again in the 36th year of the Republic. Sisters, isn't this just calling for our brothers, fathers, and husbands to die in the civil war? These two things are the most personal pain for us women! We Chinese women must express our opinions." Liu Wang Liming said: "This time, the 'National Assembly' passed a constitution, which is a completely disguised democratic constitution. Is the 'National Assembly' draft a reflection of public opinion? No, the Political Consultative Conference resolution is the great charter of the people of the whole country." Liu's words won unanimous long applause from the audience. Liu continued to talk about the issue of conscription, "We must oppose conscription and oppose fundraising. We will not contribute money or people. How many of our children cannot afford to go to school and have no clothes to wear, and we are still asked to die, to die fighting our compatriots. My son, your husband, her brother, are they all going to die in the civil war?" The whole audience shouted "Unwilling!" "Absolutely unwilling!"

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. Beiping, 10th. According to the Yenching News, Peking University professor Xu Deheng recently spoke to reporters on the pseudo-constitution passed by the "National Assembly" and the atrocities of American soldiers in Beiping, saying: "The current constitution is not based on the Political Consultative Conference. The government has violated the agreement it signed." Xu called on the people of the country to resolutely oppose it. Regarding the atrocities of American soldiers, Xu said angrily: "Look how infuriating it is! China has almost become a semi-colony of the United States. If America's 'friendship' to China is built on the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, then we swear to oppose this policy of selling out the country for personal gain."
