Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th—Reports from Chongqing newspapers indicate that the living conditions of those in the education sector in the Chiang-controlled areas are deteriorating daily, with widespread demands for improved treatment. In universities, from late last month to early this month, the national universities in the Beijing-Tianjin area, Lanzhou University in the Northwest, Northwest University, and Northwest Institute of Technology have all sent telegrams to the Chiang government's Ministry of Education requesting improved treatment. Northwest University even decided to strike if conditions are not improved. The Chongqing Professors' Association, a joint organization of professors from national colleges and universities in the Chongqing area, demanded that treatment be adjusted every three months according to the established practice for civil servants and that all universities nationwide, regardless of region, receive the same treatment as those in Beijing and Shanghai. The telegram stated that the current living conditions of university professors are such that they are "crying out from hunger and cold and can hardly continue to survive." The situation in middle schools is even more severe, with not only teachers unable to survive, but the finances of many schools also in extreme difficulty. In late last month, the vast majority of middle and primary schools in Chongqing were already heavily in debt, relying on loans obtained at the extortionate rate of 1.2% monthly interest to stay afloat. In Tianjin, more than 300 teachers at municipal middle schools had not received their salaries for three months, and some teachers were unable to even cook meals. The Municipal Middle School Teachers' Association is currently requesting salary payments and improved treatment from the Chiang-controlled Tianjin Municipal Government. In Nanjing, middle and primary school teachers petitioned the Chiang-controlled Municipal Council, requesting improved treatment. In Wuhu, primary school teachers had not been paid for more than five months of teaching, having only received several tens of thousands of yuan in advances. After petitioning three times without a satisfactory response, the teachers are planning a general resignation. Following the petition by teachers and staff of provincial schools, teachers in municipal middle and primary schools in Kunming are also demanding improved treatment.

    蒋管区教育危机严重
    各地教职员啼饿号寒
    纷纷请愿要求改善待遇
    【新华社延安二十七日电】渝各报载：蒋管区教育界生活日渐恶化，纷纷要求改善待遇。大学方面自上月下旬至本月初，平津区各国立大学、西北兰州大学、西北大学、西北工学院均通电要求蒋政府教育部改善待遇，西大并决定如不改善，将实行罢教。渝区国立专科以上学校教授联合会重庆教授会要求按公务员三个月调整待遇一次之成规，将全国各大学不分区域一律与京沪各校同等待遇。通电中指出，当前大学教授生活“已啼饥号寒，实难继续维持生活”。中学方面，情形更形严重，非但教师活不下去，好些学校经费也极为困难。上月下旬重庆绝大多数之中小学已负债累累，多数学校在一角二分息高利贷之剥削下贷款维持。天津市立中学三百余教员，已有三个月未领得薪金，一部分教员已无法举火。市立中学教职员联谊会正向蒋记天津市政府要求发薪及改善待遇中。南京方面，中小学教职员向蒋记市参议会请愿，要求改善待遇。芜湖小学教师开课五月余未发薪水，仅曾借支数万元，教师已三度请愿再不获圆满答复，将实行总辞职。昆明市立中学及小学教师继省立学校教职员请愿后，亦要求改善待遇。
