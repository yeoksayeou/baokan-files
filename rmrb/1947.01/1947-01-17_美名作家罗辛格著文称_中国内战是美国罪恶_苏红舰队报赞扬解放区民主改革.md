Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: According to the Associated Press, Washington, 12th: The Foreign Policy Association has published a report by renowned writer Rauschning after a three-month on-the-spot investigation in China, stating that "An important class of people in China believes that their country's civil war and current economic difficulties should be blamed on the United States." Rauschning also stated: The strength of the Chinese Communists is due to their own efforts, "not due to Soviet support. When the United States treated them most friendly and objectively, their leaders also reciprocated with friendship and objectivity." Rauschning continued: "The right-wing leaders within the Kuomintang will not abandon the policy of civil war. The Nanjing regime is usurped by a small group of right-wing leaders in the Kuomintang and the army (first of all including Chiang Kai-shek, the highest decision-maker). Chiang has rarely expressed the need to implement social reforms in accordance with democratic principles. Indeed, in numerous speeches, Chiang has said many nice things to the people, and has also pretended to be democratic in some actions, but the people in the areas under his rule do not have more democratic rights today than they did ten or fifteen years ago. The right-wing leaders fear the people's demands for reform and believe that they will never abandon the policy of civil war except as a temporary trick."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: TASS, Moscow: Bongin wrote in the Red Fleet Newspaper that throughout 1946, the Kuomintang army consistently attacked the areas controlled by the People's Liberation Army, which had grown in the anti-Japanese war. The Chinese liberated areas achieved great achievements in the War of Resistance against Japan. This achievement is primarily due to the Chinese Communist Party, which led these armies, uniting the anti-Japanese struggle with the struggle against feudalism and for democracy. Democratic reforms were implemented in the liberated areas, and even British and American newspapers that did not sympathize with the Communist Party had to admit the progressiveness of the policies implemented in the Chinese liberated areas, especially the land reform implemented by the people's government. The industry in the liberated areas is completely different from that in the Kuomintang areas, and has made excellent progress in 1946, while the Kuomintang areas are characterized by large-scale bankruptcies of industry and commerce. The democratic reforms implemented in the liberated areas have enabled the local government to receive the firm support of the broad masses. The peasants firmly support the regime that gave them land and the army that defends their land.

　　美名作家罗辛格著文称
    中国内战是美国罪恶
    苏红舰队报赞扬解放区民主改革
    【新华社延安十四日电】据美联社华盛顿十二日讯：外交政策协会发表名作家罗辛格在中国实地考察三个月后的报告，内称：“中国人民中的重要阶层，认为他们国家的内战与目前经济困难应归咎于美国。”罗氏又称：中共的力量是由于他们自己的努力，“而不是由于苏联的支持，当美国最友好而且最客观的对待他们时，他们的领袖亦曾酬答以友谊和客观态度”。罗氏继称：“国民党内右派领袖是不会放弃内战政策的，南京政权是由国民党及军队中一小群右派领袖（首先包括最高决策人的蒋介石氏在内）所窃据。蒋氏很少表示过承认有按民主方针实行社会改革的必要。真的，在历次讲演中，蒋氏曾对人民说了很多漂亮话，而且在某些行动上也装出民主的样子，但是他治下区域内的人民，今天并不较十年或十五年前有更多的民主权利。右派领袖恐惧人民的改革要求，认为除了作为一种暂时的诡计外，决不放弃内战政策。”
    【新华社延安十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：邦金在红舰队报上撰文称：一九四六年整年，国民党军始终进攻中国在抗日斗争中成长的人民解放军所控制的地区。中国解放区在抗日战争中获得了伟大的成就，这种成就首先是由于领导这些军队的中国共产党将抗日斗争与反封建争民主的斗争联合在一起，解放区实现了民主改革，甚至丝毫无同情共产党之意的英美报纸也不得不承认中国解放区所实施之政策的进步性，尤其重要的是人民政府所实施的土地改革。解放区的工业与国民党地区的迥然不同，在一九四六年获得优良的进展，而国民党地区在同时则以工商业之大批破产为其特征。解放区实施的民主改革，使当地政府得到广大群众坚决拥护，农民坚决的拥护给他们土地的政权，和保卫他们土地的军队。
