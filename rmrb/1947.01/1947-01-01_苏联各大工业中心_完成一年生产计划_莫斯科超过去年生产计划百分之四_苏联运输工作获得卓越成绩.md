Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 27th: Moscow, December 25th broadcast: Moscow, the largest industrial center in the Soviet Union, has completed 104% of its 1946 production plan. Industrial centers such as Leningrad, Minsk, Tallinn, and Riga have also completed the first year's production plan of the new post-war Five-Year Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 27th: Comprehensive report: In the past year, the Soviet Union has achieved remarkable results in transportation.

Regarding the increase in merchant shipping volume and the reconstruction and revitalization of ships and ports, according to the Soviet Minister of Merchant Marine, who told a TASS reporter, although major ports in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Sea of Azov were destroyed during the war, and many ships were damaged, the Baltic Sea's merchant shipping volume this year has doubled compared to pre-war levels, and the Black Sea's merchant shipping volume has increased more than fourfold compared to pre-war levels. The number and length of sea routes connecting the Soviet inland with the most important foreign ports have increased sevenfold compared to 1940. This year, ships can already unload cargo at Soviet seaports that were destroyed during the war. The creation of new docks has begun, and the Soviet Union's largest shipbuilding plant in Nikolayev, which was destroyed into ruins by the German invaders, has partially begun work. To date, much of the work on the task stipulated in the Five-Year Plan to establish regular flights along the wide Northern Sea Route has been completed. The number of passenger ships sailing on this route is twice that of 1945, and its transportation volume is four times that of that year. Next year, cargo transportation in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea will increase tenfold compared to 1940.

In terms of railways, this year a new 150,000-watt power plant will be available for Soviet railway vehicles. In the first year of the new Five-Year Plan, 1,600 kilometers of electric trains have been completed. Railway engineers have designed powerful freight train locomotives, which are twice as efficient as other products, weigh 20% less than other locomotives with the same efficiency, and can haul trains carrying 4,000 tons at speeds of 80 to 90 kilometers per hour.

　　苏联各大工业中心
    完成一年生产计划
    莫斯科超过去年生产计划百分之四
    苏联运输工作获得卓越成绩
    【新华社延安十二月二十七日电】莫斯科二十五日广播：苏联最大工业中心莫斯科已完成了一九四六年生产计划的百分之一○四，列宁格勒、明斯克、塔林、里加等工业中心亦完成了战后新五年计划第一年的生产计划。
    【新华社延安十二月二十七日电】综合报道：过去一年苏联在运输方面的工作，获得了卓越的成绩。
    在商船运输量的增加与船只及港口重修复兴建设上，据苏联商航部长告塔斯社记者称，虽然波罗的海黑海与亚速海各大港口均于战争中被摧毁，而且许多船只遭受破坏，但波罗的海商运量，今年已倍于战前，黑海商运量则比战前增加了四倍多。将苏联内地与各最重要国外港口相连结的航海路线的数目与长度，和一九四○年相比，已增加了七倍，今年船只已可在战争中被破坏了的苏联各海港卸货。新的船坞的创建工作已经开始，被德国侵略者毁为废墟的尼团拉窝夫的苏联最大造船厂已部分地开始工作。迄今对五年计划中所规定的建立沿宽广的北部海路定期航班之任务的许多工作已告完成，航行于此一路线上之客船的数目为一九四五年的两倍，而其运输量则为该年的四倍。明年黑海与波罗的海之货运将较一九四○年增加十倍。
    在铁路方面，本年将有发电十五万瓦的新电力厂供苏联铁道车辆使用。在新五年计划的第一年，已完成一千六百公里之电气火车。铁路工程师们已设计成强大的运输货车火车头，此种火车头效率二倍于其他出品，其重量比其他有同样效能的车头少百分之二十，并能以每小时八十至九十公里的速度，拖行载重四千吨的火车。
