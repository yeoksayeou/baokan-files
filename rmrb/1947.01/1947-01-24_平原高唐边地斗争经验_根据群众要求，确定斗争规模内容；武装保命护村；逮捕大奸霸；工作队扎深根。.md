[This newspaper], Weixian, 20th – A report from the Jinnan Branch Agency on the experiences of mobilizing the masses in the border areas of Pingyuan and Gaotang stated: The area west of the Jinpu Railway, 150 li north-south in Gaotang and Pingyuan, is frequently harassed by the Kuomintang bandit secret agent "assassination squads." The masses in these areas generally demand opposition to the puppet bandits and local bullies, but sometimes they raise different demands based on specific circumstances. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately grasp the timing, seize military struggles, changes in the situation, and the demands of the masses to determine the scale of the struggle based on the magnitude of the masses' thoughts and concerns and their desires.

    Armed self-preservation and village protection is a prerequisite for mobilizing the masses. "With guns, we are not afraid," is the first slogan at the beginning of the masses' struggle. Cadres working in the border areas must be good at organizing armed forces, leading militia joint defense teams to wage guerrilla warfare, cherish and help the people's armed forces, clarify that the military task is to protect and carry out the land reform movement, resolutely crack down on the Kuomintang secret agent "assassination squads," and support the masses. The masses in Zhang Yan Village, Fourth District of Gaotang, take hand grenades and landmines with them every day, preparing to strike against the intrusion of puppet bandits. "Without armed struggle, heads will roll." The masses have experienced these bloody lessons most profoundly.

    The struggle must be accurate and ruthless: for some traitorous landlords who have a very close relationship with the puppet bandits, we must first help the masses detain them, because these people have committed heinous crimes and the bandits are timid. If there is any delay, they will run away. Therefore, the struggle against these people must be accurate and ruthless. However, for those who have committed relatively minor crimes and do not intend to run away, the method of detention should not be adopted.

    The turn-over team and the work team must establish the idea of taking root. Work in the border areas is the most arduous. Generally, work teams have the idea that "as long as the struggle is launched, the responsibility is over." It is difficult to take deep root with this kind of thinking. Whenever there is a struggle, the people ask the cadres: "Are you still leaving?" Therefore, the leadership should regard the mass movement in the border areas as a long-term and arduous task that cannot be resolved in a short period of time. The work team going to the border areas must cultivate a large number of local cadres who can independently persist in their work before the task can be considered complete.

　　平原高唐边地斗争经验
    根据群众要求，确定斗争规模内容；武装保命护村；逮捕大奸霸；工作队扎深根。
    【本报威县二十日电】冀南分社报导平原、高唐边沿区发动群众的经验称：津浦路西侧，高唐、平原南北一百五十里，是伪匪蒋特“暗杀团”经常侵扰的地方。这些地方的群众，一般要求是反伪匪恶霸，但有时也根据具体情况，而提出不同要求。因之，必须根据群众思想顾虑的大小与愿望，切实掌握时机，抓住军事斗争、情况变化、群众要求，来确定斗争的规模。
    武装保命护村，是发动群众的先决条件。“有了枪我们就不怕”，是群众斗争开始的第一个口号。干部在边沿区工作，要善于组织武装，带领民兵联防队打游击战，对人民武装要十分爱护和帮助，明确军事任务为保护与开展土地改革运动，坚决打击蒋特“暗杀团”，给群众撑腰。高唐四区张宴拳村群众，每天拿着手榴弹、地雷，准备打击伪匪进扰。“没有武装斗争就会掉脑袋”，这些血的教训，群众体验的最深刻。
    斗争要准要狠：对一些和伪匪关系很密切的汉奸地主，一定先帮助群众扣起来，因为这些人罪恶滔天，贼人胆虚，稍一拖延，他们就会跑掉。所以对这些人斗争要准要狠。但对一般罪恶较轻的，不打主意跑的，不应采取扣押的办法。
    翻身队、工作队要树立扎根的思想。边沿区工作最艰苦，一般工作队又有“只要掀起了斗争，责任便算完了”的思想，这样工作很难栽下深根。老百姓每逢斗争，便问干部：“你们还走哩？”因此领导上应把边沿区群众运动看成是长期而艰苦的工作，不是短时期能解决问题的。到边沿区的工作队，一定要将本地大批干部培养起来，能单独坚持工作后，任务才算告一段落。
