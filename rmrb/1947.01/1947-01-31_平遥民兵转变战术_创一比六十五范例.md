    Pingyao Militia Changes Tactics
    Creates Example of One to Sixty-Five Ratio
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 30th] The Pingyao militia changed its tactics, increasing the enemy-to-own casualties ratio from 3:1 to 65:1. The guerrilla warfare in the county, from July to October last year, for four months, mainly adopted the tactics of concentrating forces and launching head-on defensive battles, resulting in little success. In four months of rotation battles, 120 enemies were killed or wounded, and we also suffered 43 casualties. In November last year, the branch proposed "concentrating forces to carry out explosive warfare." By December, the explosive warfare was in full swing, killing or wounding 130 enemies, of which 109 were killed or wounded by landmines and stone mines, while we only suffered two casualties. The enemy-to-own casualties ratio was 65:1.

    平遥民兵转变战术
    创一比六十五范例
    【本报太岳三十日电】平遥民兵转变战术，使敌我伤亡比例，从三与一之比，提高到六十五与一之比。该县游击战争，在去年七月到十月四个月里，因为主要采用了集中使用兵力，硬打硬冲的正面防御战术，战果不大。轮战四个月里杀伤敌一百二十名，我亦伤亡四十三名。去年十一月，分会提出“集中力量开展爆炸战”。到十二月份，爆炸战热火朝天地开展起来，毙伤敌人一百三十名，其中有一百零九名是地雷、石雷炸死炸伤的，我只伤亡两名。敌我伤亡比例为六十五比一。
