　　Xing City Third District West Avenue Joint Struggle Turns to Small-Scale Liquidation
  　Each Base Point Launches Crash Competition to Catch Up to the Laggards
    [Report from this newspaper in Xingtai] In the land reform review movement in the West Avenue of the Third District of Xing City, the estrangement between cadres and the masses has been eliminated, and the movement is developing in depth. In the past half month, more than ten accusation and struggle sessions have been launched, overthrowing thirty-two traitors and local tyrants, and recovering more than 50 million yuan worth of gains. The vast majority of citizens, shop assistants, workers, and second-tier managers have been drawn into the movement. The number of poor people's association members has increased from 210 households with 494 people to 542 households with 1,090 people. At present, the movement has shifted from the climax of joint struggle to small-scale liquidation struggle. The entire district is divided into three base points, which are mutually launching a crash competition to catch up to the laggards. After the base point cadres patiently inspect and mobilize from door to door, it has achieved very good results, and 75 new members have been developed in two days.

    【本报邢台讯】邢市三区西大街翻身检查运动中，消除了干部与群众隔阂，运动正深入开展。半个月来发动诉苦斗争十余次，斗倒汉奸恶霸三十二人，算回果实约五千余万元。广大市民、店员、工人、二经理均卷入运动。贫民会员由二百一十户四百九十四人，发展到五四二户一千零九十人。目前运动已由联合斗争的高潮，转入小型清算斗争。全区划分三个基点，互相发出突击落后的竞赛。经过基点干部挨斗挨户耐心检查动员，已收到很好效果，两天内又发展新会员七十五户。
