Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, January 5th. Our reporter Li Pu reports: A certain general of the Jinji-Luyu Military Region, on New Year's Eve, expressed his fireside thoughts to reporters, saying: In the past six months, the army and people of Jinji-Luyu have annihilated a total of eighteen brigades of invading Chiang Kai-shek troops. In the next six months, at least the same achievements will certainly be obtained. Therefore, it is firmly believed that the restoration of the situation on January 13, 1946, will arrive quickly. The general continued with a firm attitude, saying: With the assistance of American imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek may still launch local offensives in the future. This point must be taken into account. The army and people in the Liberated Areas must not be arrogant or impatient, in order to achieve final victory. The general expressed deep regret about the fate of the miscellaneous troops under Chiang Kai-shek. Taking the existing Chiang Kai-shek troops on the Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield as an example, the direct line amounts to 60,000 people, and the remaining 160,000 are miscellaneous troops. In the past six months, of the eleven brigades of Chiang's troops annihilated, three brigades were from the direct line, and the other eight brigades were miscellaneous troops. The miscellaneous troops are not unaware of Chiang Kai-shek's wolfish and poisonous conspiracy to eliminate dissidents, but their weakness lies in a lack of courage, putting Chiang's so-called "military orders" around their necks, and not daring to raise the banner of righteousness. Speaking to this point, the general said in an extremely sincere tone: The development of the situation waits for no one. A wise man submits to circumstances. Whether it is for the independence of the country or for personal advancement, the miscellaneous troops' officers should make a decisive decision and stand on the side of the people. Now is the time. The general was particularly excited when talking about the enthusiasm of the people for the patriotic self-defense war. In the past six months, the people of Jinji-Luyu have combined the self-defense war with land reform, and tens of thousands of young people have voluntarily signed up to join the army. More young people will come to the front in the future. Another phenomenon worthy of attention is that a large number of captured Chiang Kai-shek soldiers also voluntarily joined the Eighth Route Army to fight bravely. For example, Wang Keqin, a Chiang Kai-shek machine gun shooter liberated from the Ping-Han Campaign, after only a few months of education, fully demonstrated his excellent qualities and talents as a working people, and was selected as a combat hero, gradually promoted to deputy platoon leader. Wang Keqin is only one of thousands of examples.

    冀鲁豫前线
    某将军除夕论战局
    李普
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫五日电】本社记者李普报导：晋冀鲁豫军区某将军于除夕向记者发表炉边感想称：过去半年内晋冀鲁豫军民，消灭进犯蒋军共计十八个旅，今后半年内至少亦必将获得同样之成绩，故深信一九四六年一月十三日情势之恢复，必可迅速到来。某将军继以坚定的态势称：蒋介石在美帝国主义者援助之下，今后仍有可能发动局部性之进攻，此点必须估计在内，解放区军民必须不骄不燥，以求得最后胜利。某将军对蒋介石手下之杂牌军命运，深具感慨，冀鲁豫战场现有之蒋军为例，嫡系为六万人，其余十六万为杂牌军，在过去半年内消灭蒋军之十一个旅中，嫡系为三个旅，其他八个旅是杂牌。杂牌军并非不知蒋介石排除异己的狼毒阴谋，但彼等之弱点在于缺乏勇气，把蒋之所谓“军令”套在脖子上，不敢高举义旗。谈至此，某将军以极诚恳之语调称：形势的发展是不等人的，识时务者为俊杰，无论为国家求独立，为个人求出路，杂牌军各将校当机立断，站到人民方面来，此其时矣。某将军谈及人民大众对爱国自卫战争热情，尤感兴奋，晋冀鲁豫人民半年来结合自卫战争，进行了土地改革，成千成万青年自动报名参军，今后将有更多青年涌上前线。值得注意的另一现象，是大量被俘蒋军士兵即亦同样自愿参加八路军英勇作战，如平汉战役解放过来的蒋军机枪射手王克勤，经过短短数月教育，即充分发挥其劳动人民的优良品质与才能，被选为战斗英雄，逐步提升为副排长，王克勤不过是千百例证之一而已。
