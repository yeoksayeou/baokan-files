    The World Around the New Year

    The Soviet Union Summarizes Production Achievements
    The United States Faces Economic Crisis

    As the year turns, the Soviet people have victoriously concluded a year of labor. The first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan has achieved remarkable success. In basic industries: pig iron production increased by 12.5 percent compared to 1945, and steel production increased by 15 percent. The output of consumer goods increased by 21 percent compared to last year. Currently, the Soviet people are arranging the production plan for the second year of the new Five-Year Plan. On the other side of the world, on the eve of the New Year, the United States is suffering from excessive inventory and commodity prices have begun to fall, which is a sign that an economic crisis is approaching.

    新年前后的世界
    苏联总结生产成就
    美国面临经济危机
    当此岁序更新之际，苏联人民一年的劳动已作出胜利的总结。第四个五年计划的第一年，已获得卓越成就。在基本工业方面：铣铁较一九四五年增产百分之十二点五，钢增产百分之十五。消费品的产量较去年增加百分之二十一。目前，苏联人民正布置新五年计划第二年的生产计划。在世界的另一方面，在除夕之际，美国存物已嫌过多，商品已开始跌价，这是经济危机行将到来的征兆。
