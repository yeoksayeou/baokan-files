    Farmers Eagerly Demand the Return of Land to Their Homes
    Nanfeng West District Hundred Stretcher Team Forms Land Reform Brigade
    Mass Movement Unfolds Vigorously Throughout the County
    [Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 25th dispatch] The Nanfeng County West District's Hundred Stretcher Team has formed a land reform brigade, and the land reform movement is unfolding vigorously. Since the county proposed land reform in November, after the Xu Ji Farmers' Association distributed the fruits of over 300,000 yuan to the farmers according to the "filling the gaps" method, the Xu Shandou Village Farmers' Association struggled against the traitorous landlords Zhang Shijie, Jin Shenli, and the corrupt gentry Xu Wenliang, recovering over 200 mu of land and several houses. These gains were quickly distributed to 250 land-poor farmers, each receiving about three mu of land. Following this, Nian Changying of the Fifth District gathered over a thousand farmers from ten villages to overthrow the landlord Li Yaolong. The Da Si of the Second District established a Land Reform Committee to discuss land distribution. The farmers in the West District were already brewing land reform within the stretcher team, saying, "Damn it, as long as we have land to cultivate, we're willing to carry them for a year or two." They organized a hundred stretchers into a land reform brigade, divided into three detachments. After two detachments returned home, they asked the farmers' association chairman to help them carry out the struggle. The cadres of Zou Village also went to the district cadres to ask for help in carrying out land reform. Now, the land-to-the-tiller movement of the broad masses of farmers throughout the county is developing vigorously.

    【本报冀鲁豫廿五日电】南峰县西区百付担架大队组成土地改革大队，土地改革运动猛烈展开。自十一月县里提出土地改革以后，徐集农会把卅来万元的果实，按填平的办法分到了农民手里后；徐山斗村的农会即斗了汉奸地主张世杰、金身立和劣绅徐文亮，收回土地二百来亩，房子数座。这些果实很快的分给二百五十个少地的农民，每人分三亩来地。接着五区的年长营，集合十来个村的一千多农民，斗倒地主李耀龙。二区大寺成立了土地改革委员会，讨论土地分配问题。西区的农民在担架队里即酝酿起土地改革来，他们说：“妈的×，只要有地种，抬他一年两年都行。”他们百付担架，组织成土地改革大队，分了三个分队，有两个分队回家后，就向农会长要求进行斗争。邹庄村干部也去找区干部去帮助他们进行土地改革。现在全县广大农民的土地还家运动，轰轰烈烈的开展起来。
