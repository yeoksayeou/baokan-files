　　The Entire Workforce Armed to Guard Sucun Coal Mine, Full Resumption of Production
　　[From our Changzhi correspondent] The three coal mines in Sucun, Second District of Pingding, have fully resumed production under the armed protection of the entire workforce. The village is located in a border region. When the Japanese devils occupied Pingding, all coal mines were shut down. After the Japanese devils surrendered, they still could not resume production due to the disturbances of Yan Xishan's puppet regime. Recently, production was restored at the request of the masses in the village and under the armed protection of the workers. Every day, armed workers stand guard half a mile away from the mine, and if they spot the enemy, they fire their guns to cover the retreat of the masses and livestock transporting coal. Therefore, the masses can transport coal with peace of mind, and the workers can work with peace of mind. The mine not only solves the problem of coal for 25 surrounding villages, but also greatly benefits the winter transportation and production of the masses in nearby villages.
　　[From our Weixian correspondent, 11th] A certain iron factory in Linzhang, with the help of the Armed Committee, is working day and night to produce landmines and hand grenades. It can now produce more than a thousand hand grenades every day. The county's militia is actively practicing shooting and grenade throwing, preparing to meet the battle. The self-defense forces and children's corps, carrying newly made hand grenades, are standing guard, patrolling and questioning passersby. The liberated masses are full of courage and unanimously shout: "Wherever the bandit Chiang's army advances, we will eliminate them there!"

　　全体工人武装守卫苏村煤窑全部复工
    【本报长治讯】平定二区苏村三座煤窑，在全体工人武装保卫下已全部复工。该村位于边沿区，日寇占据平定时，所有煤窑均已停工，日寇投降后，又因阎伪的扰乱仍未能复工，最近在该村群众的要求及工人武装保卫下始恢复生产，每日有工人武装到窑前半里外站岗，发现敌情即打枪掩护拉煤之群众牲口退却。因此群众都能放心运煤，工人也能安心工作。该窑不仅解决了周围二十五个村烧煤问题，附近各村群众的冬季运输生产亦因而得利很多。
    【本报威县十一日电】临漳某铁工厂，在武委会帮助下，工人们日夜不息的赶造地雷、手榴弹，现每日能出手榴弹千余颗。全县民兵正积极演习射击、投弹，准备迎接战斗。自卫队与儿童团们带着新造的手榴弹，站岗放哨，盘查行人。翻身群众勇气十足，一致喊出：“蒋贼军进到那里，就把他消灭在那里。”
