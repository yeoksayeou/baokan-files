　　Secretary-General Sun Takes the Lead in Advocating for Frugality;
    Border Government Launches a Thrift Wave
    Saving Over 550,000 Hebei Currency
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] Secretary-General Sun of the Border Government took the lead in advocating for frugality. At the end of last year, he sent a letter to the Finance Department, requesting to waive all subsidies, clothing, shoes, and socks for 1947. Chairman Yang Rong and Vice-Chairman Zheng also handed over most of their subsidies and entitlements. In total, this saved 1,079 catties of rice. The Border Government Club then held a meeting to mobilize and launched a wave of thrift. As of the 5th, 53 comrades had submitted their thrift plans. Comrades Wang Peizhi, Zhao Fu, Wu Xusheng, and Li Baoquan also saved all of their annual entitlements. Doctors Liu Xinghan and Ren Xiuying from the organization also proposed saving on shoes, socks, and bedding. Comrade Cao Jiangyi from the Finance Department, in addition to saving most of his entitlements, also contributed an additional 1,000 yuan for production tasks. Miscellaneous staff members are also willing to mend old shoes, wear worn clothes, smoke less, and practice frugality diligently to support the front lines. A total of 21 and a half sets of unlined clothing, 102 pairs of shoes, 71 pairs of socks were saved, 24 people did not replenish cotton clothing, 35 people did not replenish quilts, 36 people did not receive subsidies, and 2 people did not receive technical preferential treatment. The total savings amounted to 15,909 catties of millet. Calculated at 35 yuan per catty, this is equivalent to 556,815 yuan in Hebei currency. (Xiu Shan)
