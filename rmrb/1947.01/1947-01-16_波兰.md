Poland
By This Newspaper's Research Department

Poland is the fourth largest country in continental Europe (after the Soviet Union, Germany, and France). It covers an area of 388,000 square kilometers, approximately one-fifth of our country's liberated areas. It has a population of 35 million, which is one-seventh more than our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. The entire territory is a large plain, with the Vistula River running through it from north to south. The Carpathian Mountains lie horizontally in the south, and a corridor in the northwest corner extends to the Baltic Sea. It borders Germany to the west and the Soviet Union to the east.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Poland was a feudal kingdom, plagued by constant civil wars and political corruption, leading to its three partitions by Prussia, Austria, and Tsarist Russia in 1772-98. It was not until the end of World War I in 1918 that it regained its independence, and the Soviet Union was the first to recognize its independence and abolish the unequal treaties signed by Tsarist Russia.

However, not long after independence, the fascist dictator Piłsudski openly invaded the Soviet Union in 1920, seizing 40,000 square kilometers of territory in White Russia and Western Ukraine. When he became president, he not only tore up the democratic constitution promulgated in 1921 and promulgated a dictatorial constitution in 1935, but also pursued an anti-Soviet policy and colluded with Nazi Germany in 1933, signing the so-called "non-aggression pact."

When France and the Soviet Union were negotiating the "Eastern European Pact," advocating collective mutual assistance to guarantee the security of Eastern European countries, Piłsudski disregarded Poland's fate and resolutely opposed it. As a result, on September 2, 1939, Hitler was able to launch a surprise attack on Poland, "sweeping" 1.7 million Polish troops in just sixteen days, occupying most of Polish territory, forcing the reactionaries to flee to London on September 17 with their tails between their legs to form a government-in-exile.

After the reactionaries fled, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party led the people in guerrilla warfare against the German invaders. Peasant Armies, People's Armies, People's Guards, etc., sprang up everywhere, liberating vast territories. At the end of 1943, representatives of various democratic parties (the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party) and the opposition Peasant Party, totaling thirty people, secretly established the National Council in Warsaw. Local National Councils were also organized in various provinces and regions, uniting various democratic armed forces to resist Germany according to a common "Political Action Program." In July 1944, when the Soviet army pursued the German army to the Polish border, the National Council was transformed into a temporary coalition government called the Polish Committee of National Liberation, including five representatives from the Peasant Party, five from the Socialist Party, four from the Communist Party, and one each from the Democratic Party and non-party representatives.

The Committee of National Liberation announced the implementation of the 1921 democratic constitution, granting the people absolute freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and belief. It severely punished war criminals and traitors, confiscated the property of the occupiers, established land bureaus to carry out land reform, and confiscated the land of landlords with more than 250 acres, with more than two million peasants gaining land. In foreign affairs, it also announced the return of the Soviet territory seized in 1920, the reclamation of territory occupied by Germany, and emphasized collective security, establishing a "Slavic Wall."

On December 31, 1944, the Committee of National Liberation was again transformed into the Provisional National Government. At the end of June 1945, according to the decision of the Crimea Conference, the Polish government was officially established, with the Socialist Party and the Communist Party each occupying three ministerial positions, and the Democratic Party, the Peasant Party, etc., each occupying one position. Socialist leader Morawski served as prime minister, and Communist leader Gomulka (the Polish Communist Party now has more than 300,000 members) and former Prime Minister of the government-in-exile and leader of the Peasant Party, Mikołajczyk, shared the two deputy prime minister positions. The United States, Britain, and China simultaneously announced their recognition (the Soviet Union had already recognized it).

It is particularly worth mentioning that the signing of the twenty-year "Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland" on April 22, 1945, not only ended the five-century estrangement between the Soviet Union and Poland, but also laid a solid foundation for peace in Eastern Europe.

    波兰是欧洲大陆的第四大国（次于苏、德、法）。面积卅八万八千方公里，约当我全国解放区的五分之一；人口三千五百万，比我们晋冀鲁豫边区多七分之一。全境为一大平原，维斯杜拉河南北贯通，喀尔巴阡山横睡于南，西北角有一个走廊伸到波罗的海边上，西接德国，东邻苏联。
    十二——三世纪，波兰是一个封建王国，随时内战，政治腐败，酿成一七七二——九八年的三次被普鲁士、奥大利、帝俄瓜分，直到一九一八年第一次世界大战结束时才得复国，而首先承认他的独立和取消帝俄所订的不平等条约的是苏联。
    然而独立以后不久，法西斯独裁者毕苏斯基公然于一九二○年进犯苏联，夺走了白俄罗斯、西乌克兰四万方公里领土，在他当了总统的时候，一面撕毁了一九二一年颁布的民主宪法，并于一九三五年颁布了一个独裁宪法，另一面实行反苏政策，并于一九三三年与纳粹德国勾结，订立所谓“互不侵犯条约”。
    当法苏两国正在谈判“东欧公约”，主张集体互助，保证东欧国家安全的时候，毕苏斯基竟然不顾波兰的命运，坚决反对，以致于一九三九年九月二日希特勒得以出其不意的进攻波兰，并在短短的十六天之中“扫荡”了一百七十万的波军，占领大部波土，而使反动分子们，不能不于九月十七日夹着尾巴逃到伦敦，组织流亡政府。
    反动分子逃亡以后，共产党和社会党就领导人民对德寇展开游击，农民军、人民军、人民警卫军……等风起云涌，解放了广大的国土。一九四三年年底各民主党派（共产党、社会党、民主党）和反对派农民党代表三十人，在华沙秘密成立了国民会议，又在各省区组织地方国民会议，依照共同的“政治行动纲领”，统一各种民主武装以团结抗德。一九四四年七月，当苏军追击德军至波境的时候，国民会议改为临时的联合政府，名叫波兰民族解放委员会，包括农民党代表五人，社会党代表五人，共产党代表四人，民主党及无党无派代表各一人。
    民族解放委员会宣布实行一九二一年的民主宪法，给予人民言论、出版、集会、结社、信仰等绝对自由，严惩战犯卖国贼，没收占领者财产，设立土地局进行土地改革，没收二百五十亩以上地主的土地，二百余万农民获得了土地。在对外方面也宣布退还一九二○年所夺苏联土地，索回德国侵占的领土，强调集体安全，建立“斯拉夫长城”。
    一九四四年十二月卅一日，民族解放委员会又改为临时国民政府，一九四五年六月底根据克里米亚会议的决定正式成立了波兰政府，社会党和共产党各占三个部长的位置，民主党农民党等各一个位置，社会党领袖摩拉夫斯基担任总理，共产党领袖哥摩尔卡（按波共现有党员卅余万）和前任流亡政府总理的农民党领袖米科拉兹科分担两个副总理。中美英同时宣布承认（苏联早已承认）。
    特别值得一说的是一九四五年四月二十二日苏波二十年“友好互助与战后合作条约”的缔定，不仅终止了五个世纪苏波关系的隔阂，而且为东欧的和平奠下巩固基础。
