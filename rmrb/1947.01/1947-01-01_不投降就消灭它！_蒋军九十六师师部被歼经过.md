    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th] Frontline reporter Xiao Li reports on the annihilation of the 69th Division Headquarters of the Kuomintang army at Renhewei (north of Suqian): On the night of the 17th, the New Fourth Army surrounded the 69th Division Headquarters of the Kuomintang army, which was entrenched in Renhewei. By dusk on the 18th, a full 24 hours had passed; however, Dai Zhiqi, the division commander, still had no intention of laying down his arms. At this point, the New Fourth Army launched a general assault, with mountain guns and mortars firing intensively. Eighth Company soldiers Zhang You Shen Zhan and Shen You each carried a package of explosives and stealthily placed them next to the Kuomintang army's barricades. They pulled the fuse, and with a thunderous roar, the barricades were blown away. The company political instructor shouted "Charge!" and machine guns and grenades rained down. The assault team leaped over the moat, climbed the wall, and threw another barrage of grenades into the bunkers of the Kuomintang army, then charged into the bunkers. A brand-new Maxim heavy machine gun was turned around. At this moment, a dozen Kuomintang soldiers rushed out of another bunker, and the Fifth Platoon engaged them in hand-to-hand combat. After repelling two Kuomintang army charges, the company political instructor led the soldiers in a fierce attack. Facing them was a Kuomintang soldier wielding a machine gun. The company political instructor grabbed the Kuomintang soldier's machine gun with one hand and the Kuomintang soldier's neck with the other. Two signalmen followed closely, helping to pin down the Kuomintang soldier, seize the machine gun, and open fire on the headquarters of the Kuomintang army's 69th Division. The Kuomintang army was terrified by the New Fourth Army's heroic actions, and large numbers of them laid down their weapons. From 10:00 PM to 1:30 AM, within three hours, the 69th Division Headquarters was completely taken. The division commander also made a needless sacrifice in this battle.

　　不投降就消灭它！
    蒋军九十六师师部被歼经过

    【新华社华中廿五日电】前线记者萧里报导人和圩（宿迁北）歼灭蒋军六九师师部经过：十七日夜，新四军包围了困守人和圩的六十九师师部。至十八日黄昏已整整一昼夜；但该师师长戴之奇仍无放下武器的决心。新四军至此乃开始总攻，山炮迫击炮密集轰击，八连战士张有沈詹、沈尤两人各携炸药一包，潜放至蒋军鹿砦旁，拉开弹线，霹雳一声，鹿砦飞去。连指导员叫一声“冲锋”，机枪手榴弹雨点似的打过去。突击队跃过圩壕，爬上圩墙，又一阵手榴弹摔向地堡中的蒋军，接着冲进地堡。一挺崭新的马克西姆重机枪掉转了枪口。此时，另一个地堡里冲出十几个蒋军，五班即与之展开肉搏，杀退蒋军两次冲锋后，连指导员率领战士们猛扑过去。迎面是一个端着机枪的蒋军，连指导员一手夺住蒋军机枪，一手抓住蒋军的脖子，两个通讯员紧跟上，帮助按倒蒋军，夺下机枪，转向蒋军六十九师师部开火。蒋军被新四军神勇动作吓慌了，都大批大批地放下了武器。从十时至一时半三小时内，六十九师师部即告解决。该师师长亦于是役无谓牺牲。
