Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th. A unit of the Eighth Route Army, which has been persisting in guerrilla warfare in eastern Hebei, launched a counterattack in the triangular area west of the Grand Canal, between the Pingjin Highway and the Beining Railway, from the 7th to the 12th of this month. It successively liberated the important towns of Matouzhen, Yonglezhen, and Xijizhen on the Pingjin Highway, 90 miles southeast of Beiping, as well as more than 250 large and small villages in the vicinity. On the 11th, it once attacked Wuqing County. At this point, the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops occupying Anping Town, Xianghe and other places are living in constant fear. In this battle, more than 660 invading troops and puppet police, including Li Guolun, deputy commander of the security regiment, were captured, and more than 200 people were sacrificed in vain. The Eighth Route Army captured 16 light and heavy machine guns, 5 mortars, more than 900 rifles, 16 grenade launchers, and 7 vehicles.
