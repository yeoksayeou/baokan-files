    [This Newspaper, Weixian, 27th Dispatch] The Gaojiazhuang cooperative in Guangzong has been successfully established. When the Gaojiazhuang cooperative was first established, village cadres used a liaison method to conduct in-depth propaganda among the masses. Finally, a mass meeting was held, repeatedly explaining how the common people were exploited when buying and selling things. For example, to sell a few pounds of cotton, they had to go to a market more than ten miles away, and there was no guarantee they would sell it. It wasted time and was subject to exploitation. Also, if you want to buy a hoe, you have to go to the market. The peddlers transport them from the manufacturing place, and they have to earn a portion of the profit in the middle. If we establish a cooperative, everyone needs a hoe, so we can send someone to the manufacturing place to buy in bulk, so the price will definitely be cheaper, and it will save time. Fifty-three farmers immediately signed up to join the cooperative. Li Luo, a 60-year-old man, said: "Cooperation to get rich is a certain principle. Don't look down on me for not having money. I will save money and economize to buy three shares (1,000 yuan per share)." Since its establishment, the cooperative has sporadically purchased 9,760 catties of seed cotton from the masses. The masses happily said: "The cooperative is our own store. Buying things doesn't waste time, and the price is fair. We must run the cooperative well, so we will no longer be exploited." Recently, the cooperative bought a cotton gin, which helps the masses gin scattered cotton, solving the difficulties of women's weaving. Currently, the cooperative has 57 members, accounting for one-half of the households in the village, with a share capital of 230,000 yuan.

    经过干部反复宣传
    高家庄创建合作社
    【本报威县二十七日电】广宗高家庄合作社创办成功。高家庄合作社开始成立时，先由村干部用串连方法对群众作了深入宣传。最后开群众会，反复说明老百姓买卖东西如何受剥削。如卖几斤花也要跑到十里以外的集上去卖，不一定就卖了。耽误时间，又受人家剥削。又如要买个锄，也得到集上买，小贩从制造处运来，中间也得赚一部分利。如我们成立合作社后，大家需要锄就可派一个人前往制造处大批购买，这样价钱一定便宜，又省时间。农民当场就有五十三名报名，参加合作社。六十岁的老头李洛从说：“合作致富是一定的道理，别看我没钱，省吃俭用，也要入三个股，（每个股一千元）。自成立到现在，该社零星收买群众籽花九千七百六十斤。群众高兴的说：“合作社就是咱自己的商店，买东西不耽误时间，价钱又公道，咱们可得把合作社搞好，再也不受剥削了。”最近该社买了一辆轧花车，替群众轧零花，解决妇女纺织困难。现在该社有社员五十七人，占全村户数二分之一，股金二十三万元。
