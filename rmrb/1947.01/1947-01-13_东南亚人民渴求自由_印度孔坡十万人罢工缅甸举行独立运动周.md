　　Southeast Asian People Yearn for Freedom
    100,000 Workers Strike in Kompo, India; Independence Movement Week Held in Burma
    [Comprehensive report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The national democratic movements of the weak nations of Southeast Asia – India, Burma, and Vietnam – are developing in a tortuous and turbulent manner. In India: Although the leaders of the Congress Party compromised with the British, and on the 6th, the party's National Committee passed a resolution accepting the British government's statement of December 6th regarding India's constitution-making, which was opposed by all the Indian people, the strike of 100,000 workers in Kompo city on the 8th to protest the police's unwarranted arrest of labor leaders, and the fierce struggle between tenant farmers and landlords in the Tana district near Mumbai, demonstrate from another angle the Indian people's thirst for democracy and freedom. In Burma: Just as the upper-level leaders of the interim government, such as Aung San, flew to England to participate in the British-Burmese negotiations, various places scheduled a nationwide Independence Movement Week to begin on the 10th. The vast majority of ordinary Burmese people do not believe that the negotiations will have any good results, and are prepared to take direct action to actually fight for independence. In Vietnam: Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued a letter on the 7th to the French government, parliament, and people, accusing the French imperialist elements of destroying Vietnam's independence, denouncing the French army's burning and killing atrocities, and demanding the restoration of the military positions before the Haiphong incident on November 20th and the Hanoi incident on December 17th of last year. However, the response received was the insistence on war by the French reactionary overseas minister, Moutet. Therefore, a new war between France and Vietnam is imminent.

　　东南亚人民渴求自由
    印度孔坡十万人罢工缅甸举行独立运动周
    【本报综合报道】据新华社电讯：东南亚洲的弱小民族，印度、缅甸、越南的民族民主运动，正激荡迂回的发展。在印度：虽然国大党的领袖们对英妥协，于六日该党全国委员会上通过决议案，接受全印人民反对的去年十二月六日英政府关于印度制宪的声明，可是八日孔坡城的十万工人罢工，抗议警察无故逮捕工人领袖，与孟买附近塔那区佃农与地主的激烈斗争却从另一角落说明了印度人民的渴求民主自由。在缅甸：正当临时政府中的上层领袖安山等飞英参加英缅谈判之时，各地定十日开始一个全国性的独立运动周。全缅的老百姓，大多不相信谈判有什么好结果，准备以直接行动来实际争取独立。在越南：胡志明主席于七日发表致法国政府议会及人民书，控诉法帝国主义分子的摧残越南独立，指责法军的烧杀暴行，要求恢复去年十一月二十日海防事件及十二月十七日河内事件以前的军事位置，但是得到的回答是法国反动派海外部长摩泰特的坚持战争，因此法越新大战，已成一触即发之势。
