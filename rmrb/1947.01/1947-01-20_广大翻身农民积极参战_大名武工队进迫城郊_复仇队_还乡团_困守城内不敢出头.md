[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 18th Dispatch] After the Chiang troops occupied Daming, the local guerrilla war quickly unfolded, and the vast rural areas were completely under our control. Before the enemy occupied Daming, ideological mobilization and preparation were generally carried out among the cadres of the county, and the vast number of peasants who had obtained land were filled with incomparable indignation and confidence in resisting Chiang. After the enemy occupied Daming, the county brigade immediately seized every opportunity to actively carry out activities. On the one hand, county and district cadres were intensively training militia in the north of the Zhanghe River, and on the other hand, they cooperated with village cadres, activists, and guerrilla units to press on the outskirts of the city, waiting for opportunities to eliminate small groups of enemies and "Homecoming Legions" and "Revenge Squads," and carried out in-depth propaganda, making the Chiang troops who came out to harass feel panicked, and the "Homecoming Legions" and "Revenge Squads" dare not leave the city. The guerrilla units actively carried out activities, supported the peasants, fostered righteousness, and the peasants were filled with optimism, determined to eliminate the "Homecoming Legions," "Revenge Squads," and small groups of enemies, and would never allow feudal rule to be revived. The Chiang troops constantly arrested young men and looted in the villages near the city and carried out deceptive propaganda. After the guerrilla units entered these villages, the vast number of peasants felt as if they had seen their relatives, boiling water and cooking meals, reporting enemy situations, and recounting the suffering of young men being arrested. The guerrilla units comforted them and told them that the Chiang troops' propaganda was just deception and paralysis, and it was a preparation for bloody slaughter. Under the active activities, help, and encouragement of the guerrilla units, the peasants of the whole county have been organized and armed.
