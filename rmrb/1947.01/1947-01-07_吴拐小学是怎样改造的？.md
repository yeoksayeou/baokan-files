    How Was Wu Guai Elementary School Transformed?
    Ji Wan＠
    Deep Mobilization of Students
    Wu Guai Elementary School was originally located in Rong Village, but it was not central enough. Last fall, it moved to Wu Guai, which caused dissatisfaction in Rong Village. Some people even said, "We're not going!" In order to mobilize the children of Rong Village to attend school, I went to the village every night to gather the children together, teach them songs, play games, and joke with them, so that they gradually found the teacher lovable and close to them. At the same time, I asked the children's groups to compete with each other to see which group mobilized more students. As a result, more than eighty students quickly enrolled.
    Learning and Production
    During the spring plowing season, most students' families were hoping for livestock to push manure and plant the land. There was a lot of work to do. So the students formed mutual aid groups, each group selecting a leader and deputy leader. If there was work to be done, they would report it to the group leader. The group leader would consider the importance and urgency and lead the whole group to do it after school in the afternoon. For particularly urgent work, they would go without attending classes. Students with a lot of work at home, such as Wang Ziying (13 years old), had 17 mu of land, all of which relied on him and his grandfather to cultivate; Wu Changshan (13 years old) had 16 mu of land, all of which relied on him and his mother. The students were unwilling to help him, which prevented him from attending school. The school used a blitz approach, encouraging students to find hoes and collectively help them plow a plot. After finishing the work for their families, the problems of several poor students were quickly resolved. Some students who had to hoe all day, although they could not attend school, studied during the three times of breakfast, lunch, and evening. They learned about the same as the students in the school. For extracurricular study, each person prepared a new word notebook. When asking for leave, the new words were written in the notebook for him. For example, when Wu Shun went to Wagang to deliver flowers to his aunt's house, he wrote the sentence "Wu Shun delivers flowers to aunt's house" in his notebook. As a result, he learned to write it and recognize it. Parent Wu Xinan said: "My second son grinds flour, and writes a little after grinding for a while. Before long, he learned to write the two words 'grind flour'."
    Extracurricular Activities
    In the beginning, singing and running in the morning did not arouse much interest among the students, so it was changed to sweeping leaves. I also competed with them to sweep. Ying Kuisheng took off his shirt while sweeping leaves, sweating all over. In class, I wrote a few sentences: "Ying Kuisheng, truly hard-working; sweeping leaves, setting an example" to let the students learn. After it snowed, it was impossible to sweep the leaves. The students still got up early, so they were mobilized to pick up manure. The students from Wu Guai, Zao Ke, and Rong Village were divided into three groups, and each group was further divided into two subgroups. Every morning, one person from each subgroup was sent to pick up manure. At that time, I was afraid that the students would find picking up manure unsightly, so I took the lead in getting up early. When the students saw the teacher picking up manure, those who did not pick it up also picked it up. Those who picked up manure had "labor points" recorded in the register, which made the students pay even more attention, and they picked it up with even more energy. I often got up early and waited secretly by the village to see who got up early and whether they were stealing manure. Doing this made the students feel that the teacher investigated in detail, and they did not dare to deceive the teacher. So the students carried manure baskets to pick up manure to and from school. By the time of the holiday, they had picked up two large carts, which were sold for 1,700 yuan, and each person bought a manure basket. The parents were very happy and said, "They study and are diligent."
    Rong Guitian Got Better
    The student Rong Guitian did not follow this, but scolded and beat that, and no one in the village dared to say anything. The family also had no way to deal with him. All the students asked to expel him. I thought expulsion was not the solution. Previously, the students did not talk to him or contact him. I especially talked to him and approached him. When the students raised opinions about him, I deliberately found his advantages and said in front of everyone: "Guitian has advantages. As long as he corrects his shortcomings well, he will definitely be very promising in the future." Therefore, he slowly got better. He called the students to go to school early to sweep leaves and pick up manure. Later, he was elected as a model and group leader, and also elected as a squad leader. The masses said to me: "Going to school is good. Even very bad children have become better."
    Helping the Masses
    After school, I sat with the masses and chatted about household matters. If anyone needed help, I would help him immediately. The student Wu Yongqing's family needed someone to paste dried bean curd sheets in the sun, so he came to the teacher, and I pasted them for half a day. The student Guang'an's father came to find someone to plant sweet potatoes. Carrying water was especially far away, so I carried water for him for half a day. During the winter school, I took turns giving political lessons to the village cadres in the three villages at night. In this way, not only were the masses and teachers harmonious, but the village cadres also saw the teachers as assistants to the village. They also consulted with the teachers when they held meetings and asked the teachers to handle things. The problems of teachers and schools were also resolved very timely and thoughtfully.

    吴拐小学是怎样改造的？
    季完＠
    深入动员生学
    吴拐小学原设荣村因不适中，去秋搬到吴拐，这就引起了荣村的不满，甚至有的人说：“咱不去了！”我为动员荣村的儿童上学，每夜去该村集合儿童在一块，教歌、游戏、玩笑，使他们渐渐觉着老师可爱，靠近老师。同时叫儿童组互相比赛，看那组动员的学生多，这样一来，学生很快就有八十多名入学。
    学习与生产
    春耕时，多数学生家里盼牲口推粪耩地，活非常多，于是学生就组成互助组，每组选正副组长，有活的向组长报告，组长酌量轻重缓急，领着全组在下午下课后去做。特别要紧的活，不上课就去。学生家活多的如王自英（十三岁），家有十七亩地，全靠他和他祖父种；吴常善（十三岁），家有地十六亩，全靠他和母亲，学生不愿同他互助，以致他不能到校。学校就用突击办法，鼓励学生各找锄头，全体替他俩干一垧，做完了他两家的活，就这样很快的把几家贫苦学生的问题解决了。有几个须整天锄地的学生，虽不能到校，就在吃早饭、午饭、和晚上三个时间学习，他们与校内的学生学习得也差不多。课外学习，每人准备一个生字本，请假时把生字给他写在本子上，如吴顺往瓦岗给他姨家送花，就在本子上写了句“吴顺送花走姨家”，结果他写会了，认会了。家长吴喜南说：“俺二小推磨哩，推一会就写写，不一会就把“推磨”两个字写会了”。
    课外活动
    开始清晨唱歌跑步，学生不感多大兴趣，便改为扫叶子，我和他们也争着扫。荥奎生扫叶子时脱光了脊梁，出了满身大汗。上课时就编了几句：“荥奎生，真苦干；扫叶子，起模范”。让学生学习。下雪后，叶子没法扫了，学生还是起得很早，就发动拾粪，划吴拐、枣科、荣村三个村的学生为三个组，每个组再分两个小组，每天早晨一小组派出一人去拾粪。当时怕学生嫌拾粪不好看，我便起早带头；学生见到老师拾粪，有不拾的也拾起来了。拾了粪的，就在名册上记“劳动点”，这更使学生注意了，拾的越发有劲。我常早起到村边背地里等着，看到底谁起得早，是否偷粪，这样一做，学生就更觉得老师调查得详细，也不敢哄老师了。于是学生上下学都背着粪箕拾粪。到放假时，一共拾了两大车，卖了一千七百元，每人买了一个粪箕子，家长都很高兴的说：“又念书，又勤劳”。
    荣贵田变好了
    学生荣贵田不跟这个闹，就跟那个打骂，村上没人敢说，家里人也没办法，全体学生要求把他开除，我想开除也不是办法。先前学生不和他说话，不与他接触，我特别跟他说话，与他接近，学生提他的意见时，我就专意找出他的优点，在大家面前说：“贵田有好处，只要他好好的改缺点，将来一定很有希望”。因此他就慢慢的好起来，早起叫学生上学扫叶子拾粪，后来被大家选为模范和组长，又选为队长。群众对我说：“上学不错，很坏的小孩子都变好了”。
    帮助群众
    放学后，我与群众坐在一块，拉些家常话，遇有找帮忙的马上给他办。学生吴永庆他家晒粉皮没人贴，来找老师，就给他贴了半晌。学生广安他爹来找栽红薯，挑水特别远，我就给他挑了一晌。在办冬学时，夜里我轮着向三个村帮助村干部讲政治课。这样，不光群众与教员融洽了，村干部看到教员是村的助手，开会时也和教员商量，有事也找教员办。对教员与学校的问题，也解决得特别及时与周到。
