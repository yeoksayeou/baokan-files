Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th.解放日报(Liberation Daily) reporter Lin Jian reports: As the Old Lunar New Year approaches, the streets of Yan'an are bustling. In recent days, I have witnessed peasants from all around flocking to various shops to make purchases. The retail departments of trade companies are crowded with customers from morning till night. Often, a customer has to wait half an hour to squeeze to the counter, resulting in the company's sales this month increasing by more than 80% compared to December last year. In the small market, the business of general merchandise merchants is also excellent, creating a scene of bustling activity. Respected figures in the business community told the reporter: Currently, the prices of goods from outside the border have fallen by 15% to 25%, including cloth and cotton. The value of the border currency has increased and has not fallen. The peasants in the surrounding areas enjoy a prosperous life, and those who come to the market for transactions are extremely enthusiastic.

　　旧历年关到来
    延市生意兴隆
    边币比值提高物价下跌
    【新华社延安十六日电】解放日报记者林间报导：旧历年关日益临近，延市街头顿形热闹。记者连日目睹四乡农民纷赴各店铺购物，贸易公司门市部从早迄晚挤满顾客，往往一个顾客须等候半小时才能挤进柜台，致该公司本月份比去年十二月份售货增加百分之八十以上。小市场内，杂货商交易亦极佳，成车水马龙之势。商业界有威望人士告记者说：目前外货价格已下降百分之十五至二十五，包括布匹及棉花，边币比值提高而并未下降，四乡农民生活优裕，到市场交易者，极为踊跃。
