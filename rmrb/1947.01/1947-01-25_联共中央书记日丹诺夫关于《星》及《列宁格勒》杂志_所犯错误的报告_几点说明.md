In the autumn of last year, in order to realize the new Five-Year Plan more quickly and effectively, the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party conducted an inspection of cultural and artistic work. From the end of August to the beginning of September, a series of directives were issued, calling on writers, playwrights, screenwriters, theatrical performers, and magazine editors to correct errors and biases that lacked ideology, violated policies, and distorted the realities of life, to break away from the influence of bourgeois consciousness, actively reflect the life of Soviet restoration and construction, and strive to portray the Soviet people who are enthusiastically and wholeheartedly engaged in socialist construction. The materials we have received so far include only Zhdanov's report and the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee "On Theater Performance Programs and Improvement Methods." The original translations are quite long, and we can only publish excerpts. According to a report by an American journalist, Middleton, a play by Grossman, the author of "The People Are Immortal" and "Life," published in the Soviet literary magazine "Banner" (Mnmya) entitled "If We Believe in the Pythagorean Sect," was also criticized by critics as "a satirical picture of Soviet society." The resolution on the theater will be published later. Now we will publish the second half of Zhdanov's report first.
★ ★ ★
Zhdanov's report is about 16,000 words long. The first part is mostly used to point out the reactionary and decadent nature of the works of Zoshchenko and Akhmatova, and to criticize the errors of the two magazines, "Star" and "Leningrad."

Regarding Zoshchenko - The "Star" magazine published his "The Adventures of a Monkey," "The significance of this 'work' is to describe the Soviet people as a group of lazy and deformed people, a group of stupid and backward people." (The quotations are all from Zhdanov, same below. - Editor) "Using the monkey's mouth to utter extremely malicious 'aphorisms' with anti-Soviet toxins, that is, thinking that living in a zoo is much better than living in the free air, and breathing in a cage is more comfortable than among the Soviet people." Zoshchenko, a philistine, has always disregarded the Soviet people's hard work, heroism, and morality. In 1944, when the Soviet war of resistance was in full swing, he hid in the rear and wrote a bad novel, "Before Sunrise," which was severely criticized by the "Bolshevik" magazine. But he ignored it, returned to Leningrad, and carried out activities on a large scale, even trying to occupy a leading position in the Leningrad branch of the Writers Association, "so that he dared to arbitrarily blame those who disagreed with him, and dared to threaten them with the method of writing articles to criticize them." His decadent, decadent, and negative artistic ideological principles, and the promotion of petty-bourgeois tastes, had already formed in the 1920s. He was one of the founders of the so-called "Serapion Brothers" literary group. In 1922, he said: "Now there are ideological demands on writers... Alas, to be honest, I am really uncomfortable," "From the perspective of the party, let it be said that I am a person without principles!" and other reactionary words. And the role of art pursued by his group "Serapion Brothers" is like this. They extracted its ideological content, social significance, praised the non-ideological nature of art, praised art for art's sake, and praised art for having no purpose and meaning. This is to promote decadent ultra-politicalism, petty-bourgeois roots, and low-level tastes." After pointing out his reactionary nature, Comrade Zhdanov shouted: "It is not we who should adapt our lives and system to Zoshchenko! But he should change himself! If he is unwilling to transform himself - then let him get out of Soviet literature. There must be no place in Soviet literature for decadent, empty, non-ideological, and low-level taste works."

Regarding Akhmatova and others - "Anna Akhmatova is also a representative of the reactionary literary quagmire without correct thinking. She belongs to the so-called "Acme" (a trend in Russian literature and art in the early 20th century) literary school." This school is an extremely individualistic direction in art, advocating the viewpoints of "art for art's sake" and "aestheticism," representing the escape from reality of the declining aristocratic bourgeoisie, opposing the revolution, and has always been opposed to the literature of the Russian democratic revolution. "Akhmatova's creation should be a distant past. It runs counter to the facts of modern Soviet life and cannot be tolerated in the pages of our magazines." "These works can only spread melancholic feelings, depress emotions, produce world-weariness, and make people deviate from the realistic problems of social life, from the road of social life and social undertakings to a narrow and gloomy path of personal suffering." Those who resonated with her melancholy, sorrow, and loneliness include Sadofiev and Gomilova, who published some "works that climbed into the positions of non-ideological and decadent" in Leningrad magazines.

The errors of "Star" and "Leningrad" - Since these two magazines are extremely lacking in political vigilance and accommodate works that hate the Soviet system and poison the thinking of young people, they "make the magazines publications without direction and tools for the enemy to disintegrate our youth." At the same time, they also published some "literature that is obsessed with the low-level bourgeois tastes of modern Western Europe." "Gradually began to show flattery and tendency attitudes towards foreign petty-bourgeois literature." The "Leningrad" magazine devoted more space to the Zoshchenko generation than the "Star," and also published some limericks that slandered the current life of Leningrad and insulted the revolutionary poet Nekrasov, but did not publish anything about the heroic restoration work of Leningrad. The Leningrad branch of the Writers Association should also be responsible for the errors of these two publications, as it did not provide enough excellent works. For the sake of concentration, the Party Central Committee decided to close the "Leningrad" magazine. In addition, Zhdanov further pointed out that "the biggest shortcomings in our writers' work are the detachment from the themes of today's Soviet reality; on the one hand, they unilaterally focus on historical themes, and on the other hand, they attempt to choose simple, entertaining, and empty themes." This does not meet the needs of the people. What the people expect from writers is to understand the experience of the motherland's war and describe the heroism in the work of restoring the national economy, so that they can be popularized.

The following is Zhdanov's analysis of the roots of these errors and the experiences and lessons learned.

The Roots of Errors and Shortcomings

Where do these errors and shortcomings lie?

The roots of these errors and shortcomings lie in the fact that the editors of the above-mentioned two magazines, the activists of our Soviet literary and art circles, and the leading comrades of our ideological front in Leningrad have forgotten some of the basic arguments of Leninism about literature. Many writers, comrades who are responsible for editorial work, or those who hold important positions in the Writers Association think that politics is the business of the government and the Party Central Committee. As for writers? Engaging in politics is not their business. If a person writes well, artistically, and beautifully, even if there are corrupt things in it that mislead people and poison our youth, it is published regardless. And we require that the leading comrades and writer comrades in the literary and art circles be led by politics. Without it, the Soviet system cannot survive. We demand that we do not educate young people in a decadent and non-ideological spirit, but in a vibrant and revolutionary spirit.

Everyone knows that Leninism embodies all the excellent traditions of the 19th-century Russian democratic revolutionaries in itself, and our Soviet culture has emerged, developed, and even prospered on the basis of critically transforming the cultural heritage of the past. In the field of literature, our party has repeatedly quoted Lenin and Stalin to point out the great significance of the great Russian revolutionary democratic writers and critics, such as Belinsky, Dobrolyubov, Chernyshevsky, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Plekhanov. Since Belinsky, all the outstanding representatives of the Russian revolutionary democratic intellectuals have never recognized the so-called "pure art" and "art for art's sake," and they are the advocates of "art is for the people" and that art has the highest political ideology and social significance. Art must never separate itself from the fate of the people. Please recall Belinsky's famous "Letter to Gogol," in which the great critic scolded Gogol with all his passion for trying to betray the people's cause and turn to the Tsar. Lenin called this letter an excellent work of democratic publishing that had not been censored by the Tsar, and it still has great literary significance today.

Please recall some of Dobrolyubov's literary reviews, in which he powerfully pointed out the social significance of literature. All the revolutionary democratic commentaries in Russia are full of irreconcilable hatred for the Tsarist system, and are permeated with the lofty efforts to fight for the fundamental interests of the people, for the education of the people, for the culture of the people, and for the liberation of the people from the shackles of the Tsarist system.

The fighting art is to lead the people and fight for the beautiful ideals of the people - this is how the great representatives of Russian literature understood literature and art. Chernyshevsky, who was closest to scientific socialism among all utopian socialists, said in his works, as Lenin pointed out, "emanating the smell of class struggle," he taught us that in addition to understanding life, the task of art is to teach people to correctly judge such or such social phenomena. Dobrolyubov, Chernyshevsky's closest friend and comrade-in-arms, pointed out: "It is not life that progresses according to the standards of literature, but literature that changes according to the direction of life." He vigorously promoted the principles of realism and the mass character in literature. He believed that the foundation of art is reality, which is the source of creation. Art has an active role in social life, and it can organize social consciousness. According to Dobrolyubov's opinion, literature must serve society, and it must give people answers to the most acute problems of reality. Art must also stand above the ideological level of its era.

Marxist literary criticism, as the successor of the great traditions of Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, and Dobrolyubov, has always been the protector of realistic social and true art. Plekhanov wrote a lot to expose the utopian and anti-scientific understanding of literature and art, and to defend the basic arguments that our great Russian democratic revolutionaries taught us: to regard literature as a powerful means of serving the people.

Lenin was the first person to define the relationship between progressive social thought and literature and art with extremely strict clarity. Here, I would like to remind everyone of Lenin's famous article "Party Organization and Party Literature" written in 1905. Here, he pointed out with his characteristic strength that literature should not be innovative, but it should be an important part of the overall proletarian cause. Lenin's article laid the foundation for all the characteristics of our Soviet literature. Lenin wrote:

"Literature must become the Party's. Different from the bourgeois style, different from the bourgeois hired commercial publishing industry, different from the status and significance of bourgeois writers, different from individualism, different from the anarchy of the masters, and different from the purpose of making money, the socialist proletariat must put forward the principle of Party literature, develop this principle, and realize this principle in the most complete and refined form possible."

The Principle of Party Literature

So what is the principle of Party literature?

Leninism believes that our literature should not be indifferent to politics, nor should it be "art for art's sake." It recognizes that it plays an important and progressive role in social life.

The Party spirit of literature - this Leninist principle is based on this, which is Lenin's important contribution to the science of literature.

It can be seen that the excellent tradition of Soviet literature is the continuation of the excellent tradition of Russian literature in the 19th century. This tradition was created by our great democratic revolutionaries Belinsky, Dobrolyubov, Chernyshevsky, and Saltykov-Shchedrin, continued by Plekhanov, and scientifically transformed and created by Lenin and Stalin.

Nekrasov called his poems "songs of revenge and sorrow." Chernyshevsky and Dobrolyubov regarded literature as a sacred service to the people. The outstanding representatives of the Russian pro-democracy intellectuals sacrificed for this lofty ideal and went to difficulties for this tradition under the conditions of the Tsarist system. How can we forget all this? How can we allow Akhmatova and Zoshchenko to drag out the slogan of "art for art's sake"?

Leninism recognizes that our literature has important social significance. If our Soviet literature lowers its great educational work, it means that we are going back to the Stone Age.

Comrade Stalin called our writers engineers of human souls. This definition has profound significance. This means that Soviet writers have a great responsibility for the education of the people, the education of Soviet youth, and that no stains can be allowed in literary work.

Some people are surprised and do not understand why the Party Central Committee has taken such severe steps on literary and artistic issues.

Some people think that if mistakes are made in production work and the production plan is not completed, then it is natural to take severe measures here (laughter), but if mistakes are made in educating human souls and some mistakes are made in educating young people, this can be tolerated. However, isn't this a bigger mistake than not completing the production plan?

Therefore, the Party Central Committee has to come out to intervene and resolutely correct this matter. The Party Central Committee has no right to ease its blows against those who have forgotten their obligations to the people and their responsibility for educating young people. If we are willing to treat the problems in the work on the ideological front with the attention that our activists should have, straighten out the work, and give the work direction, then we should truly criticize the errors and shortcomings of the work like the Soviet people and the Bolsheviks. Only in this way can we correct things.

The Soviet People's Demands on Writers

Some literary figures understand the problem in this way: they say that during the war, people had been hungry for a long time in literature and art. At that time, very few books were published, and readers read any work without choosing, so they could give people everything to read. However, this is not entirely the case. We cannot tolerate any literature that is stuffed to us by those muddle-headed and unskilled literary figures, editors, and publishers.

What the Soviet people expect from our writers is ideological armament, spiritual food that can help them complete the great construction plans, complete and restore and further develop the plans of our country's national economy. The Soviet people have put forward very high demands on writers. They hope to meet their ideological and cultural needs. During the war, due to circumstances, we were unable to guarantee these existing requirements. People hope to understand these events that are taking place. Their ideological and cultural levels have improved. They are often not satisfied with the quality of the literary and artistic works found here. These are what some literary and artistic workers and workers on the ideological front do not understand and are unwilling to understand.

The level of demands and interests of our people has now risen to such a level that they will be left behind. The task of literature is not only to move forward at the level of people's needs, but also to develop people's interests, raise their demands, enrich them with new ideas, and guide people forward. Whoever is not capable of guiding people forward, whoever is not capable of meeting their growing demands, and cannot solve the problem of developing Soviet culture, will inevitably become unwanted.

Eliminate Sentimentality and Strengthen Literary and Art Criticism

Due to the ideological shortcomings of the leading comrades of "Star" and "Leningrad," another error arose from this. This error is that some leading comrades established their relationship with literary figures not on the basis of the interests of the Soviet people's education, not on the basis of the interests of the political direction of literary figures, but on the basis of personal interests and the interests of friendship. It is said that many ideologically incorrect and artistically weak works were published because they were unwilling to offend this or that writer. From the perspective of similar staff, in order not to offend people, it is best not to take care of the interests of the people and the interests of the country. This is a completely incorrect and politically erroneous thing. This is equivalent to exchanging one million yuan for a copper plate.

The Party Central Committee pointed out in its decision the great harm of replacing principled relations with sentimental relations in literary and artistic work. The unprincipled sentimental relationships between some of our literary figures have had a great adverse effect, lowering the ideological level of many works and making it easy for some non-Soviet literature to enter Soviet literature and art.

Due to the lack of criticism on the part of the leaders of the Leningrad literary and art front and the leaders of the Leningrad publications, and due to the replacement of working relationships with friendly relations at the expense of the interests of the people, this has brought great harm.

Comrade Stalin taught us that if we want to preserve cadres, to educate and train them, we should not be afraid of offending anyone, and we should not be afraid of principled, brave, frank, and objective criticism. Any organization, including literary organizations, will decay without criticism. If not treated, any disease will penetrate into the bone marrow and be difficult to cure. Only brave and frank criticism can help our people cultivate themselves perfectly, encourage them to move forward, and enable them to recognize and correct the shortcomings in their work. Where there is no criticism, corruption and stagnation will take root. There will be no progress forward.

Comrade Stalin has pointed out more than once that the most important condition for our development is that every Soviet person must summarize his work every day, fearlessly examine himself, analyze his work, bravely criticize shortcomings and errors, carefully consider how to make his work achieve better results, and constantly work hard to become proficient.

This is the same for literary figures as for other staff. Whoever is afraid of criticizing his work is a contemptible coward and does not deserve the respect of the people.

In the Standing Committee of the Soviet Writers Association, the lack of criticism of work and the replacement of principled attitudes towards literary figures by friendly relations are widely spread. The errors committed by the Standing Committee of the Writers Association, especially the chairman of the association, Tikhonov, were the incorrect positions revealed in "Leningrad" and "Star." At the same time, their errors also lie in the fact that they not only did not prevent the influence of Zoshchenko, Akhmatova, and other non-Soviet writers from invading Soviet literature, but also allowed the tendencies and styles of anti-Soviet literature to invade our publications.

Improve the Ideological Level of Literature

Another reason that played a great role in the decline in the quality of Leningrad magazines was the irresponsible system of magazine leadership. In the editorial department of Leningrad magazines, no one knew who was ultimately responsible for the magazine and who was responsible for each department. In this situation, even the minimum order would not exist. This shortcoming must be corrected. This is why the Party Central Committee sent the editor-in-chief of "Star" magazine to be responsible for the direction of this publication and to improve its ideological and artistic quality. In the magazine, as in other work, anarchy and disorder cannot be tolerated. The responsibility of a magazine must be realized, so the ideological and artistic level of the materials published in the magazine must be improved.

You should restore the glorious tradition of Leningrad's literature and Leningrad's ideological front. We are very sorry when we conclude that Leningrad magazines, which have always been the breeding ground for progressive thought and culture, have now become a refuge for non-ideological thinking. The past glory of Leningrad as a center of progressive thought and culture must be restored. It must always be remembered that Leningrad was the cradle of Bolshevik Leninism. Here, Lenin and Stalin began to build a new socialist country and began to restore the inherent glory of Leningrad, the center of progressive thought and culture. Your task is to eradicate the non-ideological nature existing in literature and raise Soviet literature to the greatest height.

The creations of Soviet writers must be for the people, not for some individual people. We cannot live in society and break away from society to be free and easy, and we cannot create for individual groups.

In order to raise literature to its proper height, it is necessary to eradicate non-ideological and vulgarity. This is very necessary. We must improve and move forward so as not to lag behind the progress of our country, but to improve ourselves and raise ourselves to a higher level. We should adopt today's themes to develop culture.

A socialist country, a country with a progressive system, has a progressive culture. Therefore, we should teach Western writers, the servants of capitalism, instead of learning from them. We must guide them to follow us. There should be no flattery and passive defense in our ranks. We should actively fight against the decadent ideas of the West. Despite all kinds of obstacles, the whole world will recognize the truth of the Soviet state and its system.

Especially today, the heroic struggle of the Soviet Union on the front lines and in the rear during the Patriotic War, and the struggle to restore and develop the national economy, illustrate many truths.

Soviet writers should guide the masses to follow themselves. They must move forward with big strides, point out the way, instead of dragging behind the rearguard of the times.

However, the opposite phenomenon occurred in the Leningrad magazines "Star" and "Leningrad." This phenomenon occurred because the Municipal Party Committee, especially the Propaganda Department, was only obsessed with the issue of demanding materials, and forgot the most important thing, namely the ideological level of our magazines, and forgot that literature is to educate the young generation, so literary figures must be on the front lines.

But what good things can the already decadent Western bourgeois ideology educate people? There is nothing good. These things are not allowed to invade Soviet literature. This is absolute. Soviet literary figures must be ideologically strong, not people who are indifferent to politics. Literature is to educate the people, and our people already have a high cultural level, so the works they need are also those with a high level of ideology and art.

　　联共中央书记日丹诺夫关于《星》及《列宁格勒》杂志
    所犯错误的报告
    几点说明
    编者
    去年秋天，为了更加迅速有效地实现新的五年计划，苏联共产党中央执委会对文化艺术工作进行了一次检查，八月底到九月初，发表了一连串的指令，号召作家、剧作家、电影脚本写作者、戏剧演出者、杂志编辑人们改正缺乏思想、违背政策歪曲生活现实的错误和偏向，摆脱资产阶级意识的影响，积极反映苏联恢复和建设的生活，努力刻画满腔热情全副精力从事社会主义建设工作的苏联人民。现在我们收到的材料还只有日丹诺夫的这一篇报告和联共中央《关于剧场上演节目及改进方法》的决议，原译文都相当长，我们只可能节录发表。另据一个美国记者米德尔顿的报导，写《人民是不朽的》及《生命》的葛洛斯曼在苏联文学杂志《旗帜》（Mnmya）上发表的一篇剧本《假使我们相信比达哥拉斯派人》，也被批评家批评为“一幅苏联社会的讽刺图”。关于剧场的决议，随后发表，兹先把日丹诺夫报告的后半部发表出来。
    ★          ★        ★
    日丹诺夫的报告全文约一万六千余字，前边大部用以指出左勤科和阿赫玛托娃等人的作品的反动腐朽性质，批评《星》和《列宁格勒》两杂志的错误。
    关于左勤科——《星》杂志刊登了他的一篇《猴子历险记》，“这篇‘作品’的意义是将苏联人们描写成一群怠隋和畸形的人，是一群愚蠢而又落后的人。”（引号中都是日氏的话，下同。——编者）“借猴子的嘴说出极恶劣的有反苏毒素的‘格言’，这就是说认为生活在动物园中，要比在自由的空气中好得多，在笼子里呼吸要比在苏联人们中间舒服些”。左勤科这个市侩，一贯对苏联人民的劳苦、英勇和道德不加考虑，一九四四年当苏联抗战正烈时，他躲在远后方写了一本恶劣小说《日出之前》，就曾受到《布尔什维克》杂志的严厉批评。但他却置之不理，回到列宁城后又大肆活动，甚至想在作家协会列城分会占领导地位，“以至于敢于随便责备不同意他的意见的人们，敢于以写文章来批评的方法对他们加以威胁。”他这种腐朽、颓废，否定艺术思想原则性，宣扬小市民趣味的根性，早在二十年代就形成了。他是所谓“谢拉皮翁兄弟”文学团体发起人之一，一九二二年时就曾说过：“现在向作家们要求起思想来了……咳，实在说，我真是不舒服”，“从党派观点来看，说我是一个无原则的人，随它去吧！”等反动的话。而他的团体“谢拉皮翁兄弟”所追求的艺术的作用就是如此。他们抽去了它的思想内容，社会意义，歌颂艺术的无思想性，歌颂为艺术的艺术，歌颂艺术没有目的和意义，这就是宣扬腐朽的超政治主义，小市民根性和低级趣味。”在指明他的反动性以后，日丹诺夫同志高呼：“并不是我们应该将自己的生活和制度去适应左勤科！而是应该让他改变自己！若是他不愿改造的话——就让他从苏联文学里滚出去。苏联文学里决不能有地方登载腐朽、空洞，没有思想和低级趣味的作品。”
    关于阿赫玛托娃及另一些人——“安娜·阿赫玛托娃也正是那毫无正确思想的反动文学泥沼里的一位代表人物。她是属于所谓“阿克梅”（二十世纪初叶，俄国文艺上的一种倾向）文学一派的。”这一派在艺术上是一种极端个人主义的方向，宣传“为艺术而艺术”和“唯美”的论点，代表没落的贵族资产阶级的逃避现实，反对革命，一贯是和俄国民主革命的文学对立的。“阿赫玛托娃的创作应该是一种遥远的往事，它与现代苏联的事实背道而驰，更不能被容于我们的杂志篇页之中”，“这些作品只能散布忧郁的感情，使情绪低落，产生厌世主义，使人们脱离社会生活的现实问题，从社会生活及社会事业的大道上走向个苦恼的窄狭阴霾中去。”和她这种忧郁哀愁和孤独起共鸣的，还有萨多菲夫和果米洛娃等人，他们在列城诸杂志上发表些《向无思想性及堕落阵地里爬的作品》。
    《星》和《列宁格勒》的错误——这两个杂志既然极端缺乏政治警惕性，把仇恨苏联制度、毒害青年思想的作品容纳进来，因此“使杂志成为没有方向的刊物，使杂志成为助长敌人瓦解我们青年的工具。”同时又发表一些“迷恋于西欧现代的低级资产阶级趣味的文学”。“渐渐在外国小市民文学面前开始表现阿谀和倾导的态度”。《列宁格勒》杂志比《星》把更多的篇幅献给左勤科辈，同时又登了些诽谤列宁格勒城今日的生活和侮辱革命诗人涅克拉索夫的打油诗，而对列宁城的英勇恢复工作却什么也不登。这两个刊物的错误，作家协会列城分会也应负责，他供给的优秀作品不够。为集中精力起见，党中央决定封闭《列宁格勒》杂志”。除此之外，日丹诺夫更指出“我们作家工作中的最大缺点，便是和苏联今天的现实的题材脱离；一方面，他们单方面的热中于历史上的题材，而另一方面，则企图选择单纯消遣的空洞无物的主题。”这是不合人民要求的。人民期待于作家的是体会祖国战争的经验，描写恢复国民工作中的英雄主义，使它们普及起来。
    下面是日丹诺夫对这些错误的根源以及对经验、教训的分析。
    错误和缺点的根源
    这些错误和缺点的根源在什么地方呢？
    这些错误及缺点的根源就在于上述两大杂志的编辑，我们苏联文艺界的活动家，以及列宁格勒我们思想阵线的领导同志忘记了列宁主义关于文学的某些基本的论点。有许多作家，做负责的编辑工作的同志，或者是在作家协会占有重要岗位的人们都以为政治——这是政府的事情，党中央的事情了。而对文学家呢？从事政治那就不是他们的事情，一个人写得很好，很艺术，很美丽，虽然这里面有误人子弟，毒害我们青年的腐朽的地方也在所不管，就给以发表了。而我们要求的文艺界的领导同志以及作家同志们，都被政治所领导，没有它，苏联的制度就不能生存。我们要求，我们不是以颓废，无思想原则性的精神来教育青年，而是以朝气勃勃的精神和革命性来教育我们的青年。
    大家都知道，列宁主义在其本身中体现了十九世纪的俄国的民主革命家的一切优良的传统，而我们苏联的文化，便是在过去的批判地改造过了的文化遗产的基础上发生，发展，乃至达到了繁荣的地步。在文学领域中，我们党曾非止一次地引列宁和斯大林的话，指出伟大的俄国的革命民主作家及批评家，如柏林斯基、杜布罗留波夫、车尔尼雪夫斯基，沙尔梯科夫、谢德林、普列哈诺夫等的巨大意义。从柏林斯基开始，俄国的革命民主的知识分子之一切优秀的代表们，从来没有承认过所谓“纯艺术”，“为艺术而艺术”，而他们就是“艺术是为了人民”及艺术具有最高的政治思想性及社会意义的主张者。艺术决不能将自己和人民的命运分开。请回忆一下有名的柏林斯基的《致戈果里的一封信》吧，在这封信中，伟大的批评家以其全部的热情责叱了戈果里，因为他企图叛变人民的事业而转到沙皇方面去。列宁称这封信为一种没有被沙皇检查的民主出版界极优秀的作品，它在今天还保有巨大的文学意义。
    请回忆一下杜布罗留波夫的一些文艺评论的文章吧，在这些文章中，他极其有力地指出了文学的社会意义。我们俄国一切的革命民主的评论，都是充满着对沙皇制度的不共戴天的仇恨，而渗透着为着人民的基本利益，为着人民的教育，为着人民的文化，为着人民从沙皇制度的枷锁中的解放而斗争之崇高的努力。
    战斗的艺术是领导人民，为人民的美好理想而斗争的——俄国文学的伟大的代表们是这样地认识文学和艺术的。车尔尼雪夫斯基是在一切空想社会主义者中最接近于科学社会主义的人，从他的作品中，如列宁所指出的“发散着阶级斗争的气味”，他曾教训我们说，除了认识人生以外，艺术的任务还在于教导人们正确地评判这样的或那样的社会现象。车尔尼雪夫斯基的最接近朋友和战友杜布罗留波夫指出：“不是生活按着文学的标准前进，而是文学适应生活的方向而改变”，他竭力宣传现实主义的原则及文学中的群众性，他认为艺术的基础是现实，它是创作的源泉，艺术在社会生活中有着积极的作用，它能有组织社会的意识，按照杜布罗留波夫的意见说，文学必须为社会服务，必需对现实的最尖锐的一些问题给人民以回答，艺术又必须是站在自己时代的思想水平之上。
    做为柏林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜布罗留波夫伟大传统承继者的马克思文艺批评，从来就是现实主义社会真实艺术的保护者。普列哈诺夫写了很多东西，其目的就在于揭露那些对文学和艺术的空想的、反科学的认识，并且保卫我们伟大的俄国民主革命家所教育我们的：把文学做为服务于人民的有力手段的基本论点。
    列宁是以极严格的明确性规定了前进的社会思想对文学和艺术的关系的第一个人。这里，我请大家记起列宁于一九○五年所写的《党的组织和党的文学》这篇有名的文章。在这里，他以其所特有的力量指出，文学不应该是标新立异的，而它应该是总的无产阶级事业重要环节的一部分。在列宁的这篇文章中奠定了一切的基础，在这些基础之上，建立起我们苏联文学的特点。列宁写道：
    “文学必须成为党的。和资产阶级的风格不同，和资产阶级的雇佣的商业性的出版界不同，和资产阶级文学家的地位意义不同，和个人主义不同，和老爷们的无政府主义不同，和挣钱的目的不同，社会主义的无产阶级必须提出党的文学的原则，发展这个原则，并把这一原则在尽可能完整的，精细的形式中实现出来。”
    党的文学原则
    那么党的文学原则是什么呢？
    列宁主义认为：我们的文学不应该是与政治漠不相关的，也不能是“为艺术而艺术”的，他承认在社会生活中起着重要的、前进的作用。
    文学的党性——这一列宁的原则就是由此出发的，这是列宁对关于文学的科学的重要的贡献。
    由此可见，苏联文学的优秀传统就是十九世纪俄国文学优秀传统的继续。这一传统是由我们伟大的民主的革命家们柏林斯基、杜布罗留波夫、车尔尼雪夫斯基、沙尔梯科夫、谢德林所创造，被普列哈诺夫所继续，又由列宁和斯大林加以科学的改造而创立的。
    涅克拉索夫称自己的诗歌为“复仇和忧伤之歌”。车尔尼雪夫斯基和杜布罗留波夫视文学为对人民的神圣的服务。俄国的爱好民主的知识分子的优秀的代表们，在沙皇制度条件之下，为此崇高的思想而牺牲，为这种传统而赴难。我们怎么能够忘掉这一切？我们怎么能够允许阿赫玛托娃和左勤科把“为艺术而艺术”的口号拖出来呢？
    列宁主义承认我们的文学具有重要的社会意义。如果我们苏联文学降低了自己的这一巨大的教育工作，这就是说我们要后退到石器时代去。
    斯大林同志称我们的作家们为人类灵魂的工程师。这一定义是有着深刻的意义的。这是说苏联的作家们对于人民的教育，对苏联青年们的教育，以及在文学工作上不能允许有任何污点等方面，负有重大的责任。
    有些人很奇怪，不明白党中央为什么在文艺问题上，采取这样严厉的步骤。
    有人认为，如果在生产工作上犯了错误，没有完成生产计划，那么这里采取了严厉的手段，当然是很自然的事（大笑），而如果是在教育人类灵魂方面犯了错误，在教育青年方面犯了点错误，这倒是可以容忍的事。然而，难道说这不是比未完成生产计划更大的错误吗？
    因此，党中央就不能不出来干涉，并且坚决地纠正这件事情。党中央对于那些忘掉自己对于人民的义务，忘掉了自己对青年的教育责任的人们，是没有权利缓和对它的打击的。如果我们愿意以我们积极分子所应有的注意力来对待思想阵线工作上的诸问题，把工作整顿起来，给工作以方向，那么我们就应该真正像苏联的人民，像布尔什维克那样，批评工作的错误和缺点。只有这样，我们才能够把事情纠正过来。
    苏联人民对作家的要求
    有些文学家们这样地认识问题：他们说在战争期间，人们已经在文艺方面饥饿很久，那时书籍出版得很少，读者已经对任何作品都不加选择地读了起来，所以可以给人民一切东西去读。然而事实并不完全如此，我们是不能容忍被那些糊涂的不善于选择的文学家们，编辑们和出版者们所塞给我们的任何文学的。
    苏联人民期待于我们作家的是思想上的武装，是那些能够帮助他们完成伟大的建设计划，完成和恢复和进一步发展我们国家的国民经济的计划之精神食粮。苏联人民向文学家们提出了很高的要求。他们希望满足他们思想上文化上的需要。在战争期间，因为情况的关系，我们曾未能保证这些存在着的要求。人民希望意味这些进行着的事变。他们的思想水平和文化水平都提高了。他们常常不满足于在我们这里所发现的文艺作品的质量。这些都是某些文艺工作者及思想阵线上的工作者所不明白和不愿意明白的。
    我们人民的要求和兴趣水平现在已经提高到这样的水平，他们将被留在后面。文学的任务不仅仅是在人民需要的水平上前进，除此，它有义务发展人民的兴趣，提高他们的要求，用新的思想来丰富他们，引导着人民前进。谁要是没有能力引导人民前进，谁要是没有能力满足他们的日益增长着的要求，不能解决发展苏联文化的问题，他就必不可免地成为谁都不需要的了。
    铲除温情主义与加强文艺批评
    由于《星》和《列宁格勒》领导同志们思想上存在着缺点，从此就产生了另外的错误。这个错误就是有些领导同志们把自己对于文学家们的关系，不是建立在苏联人民教育的利益之上，不是建立在文学家们政治方向利益之上，而建立在私人的利益，友情的利益之上。据说，有许多思想上不正确，在艺术方面也很软弱的作品，就是因为不愿意得罪这个或那个作家，而就予以出版了。从类似的工作人员的观点来看，为了不得罪人，最好还是不去照顾人民利益和国家的利益。这是一件完全不正确的，政治上犯错误的事情。这就等于用一百万元换一个铜板。
    党中央在自己的决定中指出在文艺工作中以温情关系代替原则关系之极大害处。在我们某些文学家们之间的无原则的温情主义的关系起了极大的反作用，使许多作品的思想水平降低了，使一些非苏联文学的作品很容易钻到苏联文艺里面来。
    由于列宁格勒文艺阵线上的领导者们方面及列宁格勒的刊物的领导者方面批评的缺乏，由于以牺牲人民的利益，而把友爱的关系代替了工作关系的缘故，这就带来了极大的害处。
    斯大林同志教育我们说，如果我们要保存干部，要教育和培养他们，我们就不应该害怕得罪什么人，就不应害怕原则性的，勇敢的，坦白的，客观的批评。任何的组织，包括文学的组织在内，没有批评便会腐朽。如果不医治的话，任何的病都会深入膏肓，难于再好。只有勇敢和坦白的批评才能帮助我们的人民修养得完美，鼓励他们前进，使他们认识及改正自己工作中的缺点。那里没有批评，那里的腐朽和停滞就会生起根来。那里也就没有向前的进步。
    斯大林同志不止一次地指出我们的发展的最重要的条件，便是必须使我们每一个苏联人每天都把自己的工作做一总结，毫无惧怕的检查自己，分析自己的工作，勇敢的批评缺点和错误，周密地思考，怎样才能使自己的工作达到更优良的成绩，而不断的努力工作使自己精通起来。
    对于文学家们，这一点和对其他的工作人员是一样的。谁要是害怕批评自己的工作，谁就是遭人卑视的懦夫，他就不配受到人民的尊敬。
    在苏联作家协会常委会里，那里对工作的没有批评的态度，对文学家们的原则态度之被友情关系所代替是广泛地散布着。作家协会常委会，尤其是协会的主席吉洪诺夫所犯的错误便是那些已被揭露了的在《列宁格勒》和《星》中所表现了的不正确立场，同时他们的错误还在于他们不仅是没有阻止左勤科，阿赫玛托娃以及其他非苏联作家影响对苏联文学的侵入，而且放任了反苏联文学的倾向和风格向我们刊物侵入。
    提高文学的思想水平
    对列宁格勒杂志质量低落起了很大作用的又一原因，便是杂货领导上的毫无责任性的制度，在列宁格勒杂志的编辑部里，就知道谁是对杂志负总责，谁是负责各部的。在这情形下，就是起码的次序也是不会有的。这种缺点必须加以纠正。这就是党中央为什么派了《星》杂志的总编辑去负责这一刊物的方向，以及提高思想及艺术质量的原因。在杂志里，也像在其他工作中一样，是不能容忍无政府状态及无秩序的现象的，必须意识到一个杂志的责任，因此就必须提高在杂志中被刊登出来的材料的思想和艺术的水平。
    你们应该恢复起列宁格勒的文学及列宁格勒思想阵线的光荣传统，当我们做结论说那曾一向是进步思想，进步文化的苗床的列宁格勒杂志，如今成了无思想性的避难所时，我们是非常惋惜的。应该把做为进步思想和文化中心的列宁格勒的往日的光荣恢复起来。必须永远记住：列宁格勒曾是布尔什维克列宁主义的摇篮。在这里，列宁和斯大林曾开始建立新的社会主义国家，开始恢复了列宁的城市进步的思想文化中心的固有的光荣之荣誉事业。你们的任务是把文学中所存在的无思想性铲除，并把苏联的文学提到最大的高度。
    苏联作家们的创作，必须不是为了某些个别的人，而是为了人民。我们不能生活在社会里而脱离社会去自由自在，不能为个别的集团去创作。
    为了把文学提高到应有的高度，就必须铲除无思想和庸俗。这是非常必需的。必须提高和前进，使之不落后于我们国家的进步，而使自己更加改善，提高到更高的水平。应该采用今天的题材，使文化发展起来的。
    社会主义国家，这一具有进步制度的国家，它有着进步的文化。因此我们应该教导西方的文学家们，资本主义的服务者们，而不是向他们去学习。我们必须引导他们跟我们走。在我们队伍里不应该有阿谀及消极的防御。我们应该和西方的腐朽的思想进行积极的斗争。尽管存在着各种各样的障碍，全世界会认识苏联国家及其制度的真理的。
    尤其是在今天，苏联在祖国战争的前线和后方的英勇斗争，恢复和发展国民经济的斗争，更说明许多的真理。
    苏联的作家应该引导着群众跟着自己走，他必需要大踏步前进，指出道路，而不是拖在时代的后卫之中。
    而在列宁格勒的杂志《星》和《列宁格勒》却是相反的现象。这现象之所以发生，是因为市委，尤其是宣传部只迷恋于要求材料问题，而忘记了最主要的事，即我们杂志的思想水平问题，忘记了文学是教育年青的一代的，因此文学家们，就必须是站在前进的阵地上。
    可是已经腐朽了的西方资产阶级思想能有什么好东西去教育人们呢？什么好的也没有。这些东西就不许可侵入到苏联文学中来的，这是绝对的。苏联文学家们必须是在思想上是坚强的，而不是与政治无关的人。文学是教育人民的，而我们的人民已经具有很高的文化水平，因此他们所需要的作品，也是具有高度的思想和艺术水平的东西。
