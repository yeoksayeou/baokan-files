Frontline, Our Army's Regiment Party Committee Approves
    Special-Class Hero Li Zhiwu's Admission into the Party
    He Was Originally a Laboring Person Enlisted by Chiang Kai-shek
    After Laying Down His Weapons, He Became an Outstanding People's Combat Hero
    [This newspaper's report from the Jilu豫 Frontline, 18th] Reporter Wu Xiang reports: The Communist Party Committee of a certain regiment of the Eighth Route Army recently approved the admission of Li Zhiwu, a special-class combat hero in the patriotic self-defense war, into the Chinese Communist Party, and held a grand party member meeting to convey this decision. Comrade Li Zhiwu is, after Wang Keqin, another example of a Chiang army soldier transformed into a loyal people's combat hero. He is from Anhui. When he was young, the Kuomintang's Bao-chief seized his family property, and his father and uncle were killed. He was forced to wander to a dilapidated temple, where he was fortunately taken in by a poor old woman from Henan as her adopted son, but he was eventually captured by the Kuomintang and enlisted in the 30th Army. During the Ping-Han Campaign, he laid down his weapons and joined the Eighth Route Army. Since the patriotic self-defense war, he has shown himself to be a brave combatant; after being promoted to squad leader, he has also shown himself to be an excellent commander. In the guard tower blocking battle, his clothes were set on fire by an incendiary bomb. In this most urgent moment, he used a razor to cut off his sleeve and then picked up his machine gun and strafed the Chiang army until he drove them back. Only then did he walk off the front line, supporting his fire-injured arm. In the Battle of Shao'er Village, he led his squad to be the first to rush onto the village wall. He was wounded in three places but continued to command his squad to repel the Chiang army's counterattack. Five wounded comrades in the entire squad also refused to leave the front line, maintaining the breakthrough on the village wall. Through his personal experience, Li Zhiwu recognized that the Communist Party is the savior of the Chinese people and had long hidden an infinite love for the Communist Party in his heart; it was not until before a certain battle that he publicly expressed his desire for the first time, handing over the 1,000 yuan bonus he received when he was elected as a combat hero to the instructor, saying, "I am not a party member, but I also want to pay party dues. If I sacrifice myself, please recognize me as a party member." After the battle, the Party Committee held a special discussion and unanimously decided to give this respectable combat hero the glorious title of Bolshevik.

　　前线我军某团党委批准
    特等英雄李治五入党
    他原是被蒋介石抓去当兵的劳苦人民
    放下武器后变为优秀的人民战斗英雄
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十八日电】记者吴象报导：八路军某团中共党委会顷批准爱国自卫战争中的特等战斗英雄李治五加入中国共产党，并召开隆重的党员大会传达此一决定。李治五同志为继王克勤之后由蒋军士兵转变为忠诚的人民战斗英雄。他是安徽人，幼时被国民党的保长霸占了家产，父亲和叔父都被害死，被迫流落破庙，幸遇河南一个贫苦的老太太收为养子，但终于又被国民党抓走，在三十军当兵。在平汉战役中放下武器，参加了八路军。自爱国自卫战争以来，他表现出是一个勇敢的战斗员；被提拔为班长后，又表现出是一个优秀的指挥员。警楼阻击战中，他的衣服被燃烧弹烧着了，在这最紧急的当儿，他用剃刀把衣袖割下，又端起机枪向蒋军扫射，直到把蒋军打退，他才托着那只受了火伤的臂膀走下火线。邵耳寨战斗，他率领他的班，首先冲上寨墙，全身三处负伤，仍指挥全班击下蒋军的反扑。全班中五个负伤的同志也都不肯下火线，始终保持住寨墙上的突破。李治五在亲身体验中，认识共产党是中国人民的救星，早已在心里隐藏着对共产党的无限热爱；直到某一次战斗之前，他才第一次公开表明他的愿望，把他当选为战斗英雄时领的一千元奖金交给指导员说：“我不是党员，我也要交党费，要是我牺牲了，请党认做党员。”战斗后党委会进行了专门讨论，一致决议给这位可敬的战斗英雄以光荣的布尔塞维克的称号。
