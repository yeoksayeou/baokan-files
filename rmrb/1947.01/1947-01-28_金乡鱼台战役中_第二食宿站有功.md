    Jinxiang-Yutai Campaign
    Second Food and Lodging Station Commended for Service
    [Report from the Jin-Lu-Yu Frontline Reporter Corps, 24th] During the recent Jinxiang-Yutai campaign, the Second Food and Lodging Station provided thorough care for the wounded soldiers and participating civilians, setting the best example among all the food and lodging stations and making a significant contribution to the victory. The station was established during the Zhangfengji battle and operated daily from morning till night during this campaign. Over [number redacted] stretcher-bearers and civilian laborers passed through the station each day. They ensured that hot water and hot meals were always available, and the wounded soldiers could eat noodles with eggs at any time. Housing and straw were arranged in advance. From the station chief to the receptionists, everyone provided meticulous care for the wounded. As soon as the wounded arrived, they were offered water and cigarettes. For those who couldn't move, the staff lit the cigarettes and put them in their mouths. For those who couldn't eat, they spoon-fed them egg soup. Old Chen, the head of the reception section, was afraid the wounded would get cold, so he took off his own leather jacket and covered them. For those who couldn't relieve themselves, he personally carried them to the toilet. During the busiest times, he didn't sleep for five days and five nights, which greatly moved the wounded soldiers and boosted the morale of the frontline troops.

    金乡鱼台战役中
    第二食宿站有功
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团二十四日电】在此次金（乡）、鱼（台）战役中，第二食宿站对伤员及参战群众的食宿问题，照顾周到，成为各食宿站中最好的榜样，对胜利贡献极大。该站在张凤集战斗中就已成立，这次战役中每日由早到晚。来往担架民夫达××余人，他们保证了随时都有开水喝有热饭吃，伤员们随时都能吃到挂面鸡蛋等，房子铺草等事先都有了安排。该站从站长到招待员对伤员的照顾都很周到，伤员一到就送水送烟，有的伤员不能动就把烟吸燃了给伤员递到嘴上，不能吃东西的就用勺子将鸡蛋汤喂到嘴里，招待股陈股长老汉怕伤员冻着了，就将自己的皮衣脱下盖到伤员身上，不能大小便的就亲自背着他们大小便，工作最忙时，连五天五夜都没睡觉，使伤员极为感动，大大鼓舞了前线的斗志。
