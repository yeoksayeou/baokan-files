    Successful Labor-Management Cooperation
    Hengshui's Commerce Doubles in Prosperity After One Year of Liberation

    [Special Dispatch from Weixian by this Newspaper, dated 30th] Special Correspondent Wang Yongquan of the Xinhua News Agency's Jinnan Branch reports on the situation in Hengshui one year after liberation, stating: This year, the city's trade volume has exceeded more than twice that of its most prosperous period in the past. Before liberation, the city had a total of 304 businesses, and now there are 491 stationary merchants and more than 500 itinerant merchants. Among the stationary merchants, there are 21 grain and cotton depots, 15 cloth businesses, 16 wineries, 12 iron businesses, 14 coal factories and pottery businesses, and 24 Chinese and Western pharmacies; the itinerant merchants are mostly engaged in general merchandise, all of which have developed after government loans. Under the policy of labor-management cooperation, the wages of workers and shop assistants, in addition to food, amount to 15 to 30 jin of rice per day. As a result, output has greatly increased, with an annual output of more than 2 million jin of copper, exceeding any previous year. Jianhua Ironworks is a small public-private joint venture with a total of 30 people. From April to November, it produced a total of 4,669 pots, 1,432 plowshares, and 1,494 parts for phoenix bows (cotton ginning bows), enabling countless phoenix bows and cotton gins to start work. Recently, in order to meet the needs of the militia, it rushed to manufacture ××,000 hand grenades. Since the liberation of Hengshui, the dock porters have elected their representatives and established the Porters' Union. So far, each worker can earn an average of 70,000 yuan, with a surplus of 2,000 to 3,000 jin of rice. The 202 water porters, who were the poorest in the past, and their 834 family members, old and young, are now well-fed and clothed. Worker Jiang Dongnian said: "The difference between now and last year is truly like heaven and hell. When the Japanese were here, we went hungry for two out of three days. Since the establishment of the Porters' Union, I can earn 1,200 yuan a day, and the money I earned this year bought three mu of good land." He smiled and said, "My old man is stronger, and my wife and children are fatter. I haven't had such a good life in half my life." Then he said, "Since Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the liberated areas, I have mobilized dozens of workers to go to the front line, and we must desperately defend this good life of liberation." Hengshui relies on the west bank of the Fuyang River, where a new street has been opened, with stalls full of goods every day, connecting the resources of central and southern Hebei. The large ships and fishing boats parked in the Fuyang River, when the smoke rises from the chimneys, resemble a long village, lying across the Fuyang River.

    劳资合作经营得法
    衡水解放一年
    商业繁荣两倍
    王涌泉
    【本报威县三十日电】新华社冀南分社特约通讯员王涌泉报导解放一年之衡水情况称：今年这个城市的贸易额超过以前最繁荣时期的两倍以上。该城未解放前共有商家三○四户，现在已有坐商四百九十一户，行商五百余户。其中坐商计有粮棉货栈二十一家，布业十五家，酒锅十六家，铁业十二家，煤炭厂缸瓷业十四处，中西药房廿四处；行商多为杂货业，都是政府贷款以后发展起来的。在劳资合作的方针下，工人店员的薪资除吃外，每天得米十五到三十斤。因此产量大增，现年产铜二百余万斤，超过了以往任何一年。建华生铁厂是一个公私合办的小型工厂，共卅个人，从四月到十一月，共出锅四六六九口、铧一四三二张，凤弓（弹花弓）零件一千四百九十四件，使无数的凤弓、轧花车开了工。近来为适应民兵的需要，赶造了×万×千只手榴弹。码头扛脚工人自衡水解放后，他们自选代表，成立了扛脚工会，到现在每个工人平均能得七万元，可余米二千斤到三千斤，往年最苦的二百零二个水脚工人，连家属老幼八百卅四口人，今年丰衣足食。工人蒋东年说：“现在和去年比真是天堂地狱，日本在时，三天有两天挨饿。自成立扛脚工会，我每天能挣一千二百元，今年挣的钱买了三亩好地”。他微笑着说：“老爹壮了，老婆孩子也胖了，半辈子也没过过这样的好日子。”接着说：“蒋介石进攻解放区以来，我已经动员好几十个工人走上了前线，拚命也得保卫住这翻身的好光景”。衡水靠滏阳河西岸，新辟一条大街，席棚里每天满摆着商货，他们沟通着冀中冀南的有无。停泊在滏阳河的大船与渔船，每当炊烟四起时候，宛如一条长的村落，横在滏阳河上面。
