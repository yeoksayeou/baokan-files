Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 8th: Nanjing News: On the 3rd, Nanjing students, initiated by Central University, continued their marches and demonstrations to protest the U.S. military's rape of a female student. On the evening of the 2nd, Central University held its third department representative meeting. Despite sabotage by party members, those advocating demonstrations still held an overwhelming advantage. Students prepared slogans and flags that night, with most staying up all night. The march on the 3rd was attended by students from the School of Finance, Pharmaceutical College, Drama College, and Jinling University, including over twenty teaching assistants. The marching column shouted slogans along the way. In addition to distributing twelve slogans such as the mimeographed "U.S. Military Presence in China Hinders Chinese Unity," they also shouted at passing U.S. military personnel, "National Assembly" special vehicles, and the "Capital Garrison Command": "Oppose the civil war!" "Demand democracy and peace!" "Rational soldiers don't fight civil wars!" From Central University to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the asphalt road walls and passing vehicles, spanning tens of miles, were plastered or covered with Chinese and English slogans such as "U.S. troops don't leave, the civil war won't stop." Upon reaching the "National Government," they submitted a "Letter to the National Government," demanding a prompt reply. When passing the Kuomintang's *Central Daily News* and *Peace Daily* offices, they plastered the doors, windows, and walls with slogans such as "Central Daily News, don't be cold-blooded animals!" "Do you want your sisters to be raped by U.S. soldiers?" "Peace Daily, show some conscience!" "Where is morality! Where is justice! Stop spreading rumors!" "The people in charge of Peace Daily also have mothers and sisters!" At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the students wrote: "Oppose diplomacy that only follows the U.S.!" "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must safeguard national dignity!" "Don't be puppets of the Americans!" "We demand independent and autonomous diplomacy!" A UNRRA jeep was written on with "Relief must be fair, relief must be for the purpose of peace." At the U.S. Embassy, ​​they were received by Stuart, and student representatives put forward three requirements: (1) Severely punish the perpetrators; (2) Publicly apologize to the Chinese people; (3) Immediately withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China. Stuart promised to reply immediately after receiving a formal report and to report the students' opinions to the U.S. government. The march ended here.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 6th: Nanjing, January 3rd News: On the 2nd of this month, the Nanjing students' march and demonstration protesting the U.S. military's rape of a Peking University female student was attended by about 5,000 students from six colleges and universities, including Central University, Jinling University, National Music Academy, Ping Opera College, Oriental Language College, and Art College, making it the largest march in Nanjing since the "September 18th" Incident. At the beginning of the march, students from the other five schools shouted to the students of Central University, "Welcome Central University students to lead us!" Amid applause and cheers, more than 2,000 students from Central University volunteered to join the main march. The procession was led by a truck, on which were actors dressed as three U.S. soldiers and a Chinese female student, a rickshaw puller, and a worker, with the former showing a hideous and fierce attitude towards the latter, which was extremely realistic. The marching crowd shouted slogans such as "U.S. troops get out" in Mandarin and English along the way. When they arrived at the National Government, the student presidium and Yang Cunbin, the principal of the National Drama College, and others went inside to petition. The military police, holding guns, attempted to fire, and the situation remained deadlocked for a long time. The crowd outside shouted: "The government must express its attitude!" "Demand that the government guarantee human rights!" After these slogans, they were received by Lin Shu, a military advisor. The presidium immediately handed over a letter to Chiang Kai-shek, which briefly stated: U.S. troops treat the Chinese people like grass, disregard Chinese sovereignty, and commit atrocities everywhere, leaving bloodstains everywhere. The Chinese people have long opposed the U.S. military's presence in China. Intellectuals should speak out for the people. They specifically suggested that in addition to lodging a complaint with the Security Council regarding the U.S. military's atrocities, they should also negotiate with the U.S. government for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. The marching procession passed through major streets and stopped near Xinjiekou for an hour to explain the ins and outs of the movement to the masses. Afterwards, the march continued, making its way through the crowded streets and heading straight to the U.S. Embassy, ​​where they handed over a letter to Stuart via the U.S. Counselor Barde, protesting the U.S. military's atrocities against Chinese compatriots, and demanding that the U.S. government stop arms shipments to China, which fuels the Chinese civil war, and also asked Stuart to give a public reply.

TASS, Shanghai, January 7th: Thirty-eight professors from various institutions of higher education here recently issued a protest, opposing the U.S. policy toward China and the recent atrocities committed by U.S. troops in Beiping in raping a Chinese female student. The protest stated: The U.S. policy toward China endangers peace, increases domestic difficulties in the U.S., and fuels the flames of the Chinese civil war. The serious incident in Beiping proves that Americans treat Chinese people as if they were the people of a semi-colonial country. The professors expressed solidarity with the student movement and demanded that the perpetrators be punished and that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from China. The Shanghai Students' "Committee to Protest U.S. Military Atrocities" decided to continue demonstrations to protest the killing of a Chinese rickshaw puller by a U.S. sailor on New Year's Day. The committee also decided to launch a boycott of American goods.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 6th: United Press, Hong Kong, January 5th: The movement protesting the U.S. military's rape of a Peking University female student has spread to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Women's Federation has resolved to demand that U.S. troops withdraw from China to avoid the continuation of such incidents. Students at Dat Tat (transliteration) Middle School have resolved to send a telegram to Peking University expressing their sympathy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 7th: Beiping News: "In accordance with Chinese law, the culprit U.S. military authorities publicly apologize, and U.S. troops immediately withdraw from China!" This is the serious demand of students from Tsinghua and Yenching Universities protesting the U.S. military's rape of a Peking University female student. Students from the two universities distributed a declaration. The Tsinghua Student Union's declaration indignantly pointed out: "We really can't believe that after shedding blood for eight years, sacrificing the lives of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians and the wealth of hundreds of millions, we got rid of one Japanese imperialism only to be replaced by another 'ally' that enslaves us!" The student self-governing associations all pointed out in the "Letter to Students Nationwide" that the main reason for this incident is that the Kuomintang government does not have independent diplomacy and relies entirely on the United States. In order to obtain surplus materials as capital for the civil war, it colludes with American warmongers, and its diplomacy is entirely one of slavish subservience. They unanimously shouted: The government should stop the civil war, and U.S. troops should withdraw from China!

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 7th: Beiping, January 4th News: After boycotting classes, demonstrating, and marching to protest the U.S. military's atrocities, Nankai and Beiyang Universities in Tianjin issued a declaration resuming classes on the 3rd, which briefly stated: "Resuming classes is not a compromise, let alone an end. On the contrary, this is just the beginning of our movement." "Although we are resuming classes, we will be more vigilant and more sensitive. Our indignation cannot be stopped unless U.S. troops withdraw from China! Our movement cannot be stopped unless U.S. troops withdraw from China!" Students from each school have decided to organize a special committee (name not yet determined) to continue engaging in the movement for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China.
