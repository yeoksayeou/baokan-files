　　Exhaust Every Means to Drown the People
    ——A Chronicle of the Executive Yuan's Delay and Refusal to Supply River Management Materials
    Ximin
    “The Liberated Areas executed one hundred percent, while the Kuomintang government was equivalent to zero.” This was the fair comment made by Mr. Zhang Jichun, Chief of Engineering of the Yellow River Commission, after inspecting the entire Yellow River levee restoration project on June 20th last year, regarding the extent to which both sides implemented the Nanjing Agreement. Although the Executive Yuan has subsequently slowly transported some materials after repeated urging and protests from our side, compared to the urgent needs of the project, Mr. Zhang Jichun's words still have their reality today.
    According to the provisions of the Nanjing Agreement and the Shanghai Agreement, the Executive Yuan, UNRRA, and the National Yellow River Commission should supply our side with the first batch of 6,000 tons of grain and flour (later increased to 25,000 tons), 1,000,000,000,000 yuan in project funds, 1,500,000,000,000 yuan in relocation and relief funds, as well as urgently needed equipment and medicines for the river management project. However, the Executive Yuan, etc., consistently adopted methods of evasion, delay, and refusal, repeatedly violating the two agreements.
    Regarding the supply of grain and flour, UNRRA and the Executive Yuan stipulated with our side in Bian (Kaifeng) that 8,800 tons should be transported to the construction area by July 15th. On June 2nd, Tadder also officially announced at the Heze meeting that the flour would be transported to each repair section by June 4th; however, by June 10th, only 100 tons had been transported. At this time, our levee restoration project had commenced along the entire line, with 230,000 workers repairing the levees, requiring about 30,000 tons of grain per day, which was not even enough for one day's consumption. After repeated urging by our representatives in Nanjing and Bian, the Executive Yuan continued to delay the supply. By the 22nd, only over 500 tons of flour had been transported. Within twelve days, a meager 400 tons were transported, averaging only about 40 tons per day, insufficient for one-seventh of the workers' consumption. Until July 7th, with only eight days remaining before the final date for transporting 8,800 tons of flour (July 15th), only 2,200 tons had been transported, a mere quarter of the stipulated amount.
    All urgently needed river management equipment, except for four vehicles and two sets of surveying instruments (two theodolites already broken and unusable) sent before the start of construction, had not been transported at all by the end of June. After our area's levee repair project was forced to suspend in July, 188 bulldozers and 1,003 shovels were slowly transported to Heze.
    Because the levee repair workers had no flour to eat, they had to fill their stomachs with sorghum. They worked hard repairing the levees under the scorching sun and had no lodging at night, so they had to camp in the fields. The Executive Yuan and UNRRA had originally promised to allocate some tents; however, they were nowhere to be seen. As a result, various acute infectious diseases spread rapidly and could not be controlled. In the Juancheng section, 900 people fell ill within seven days, and in the Yunbei section, 600 people fell ill within a few days, accounting for 43% of the total number of levee repair workers in the county. The medicines that the Executive Yuan and UNRRA should have supplied were delayed and refused to be transported. Finally, they reluctantly sent dozens of small packages, which were not only too few in quantity, but also completely lacked injections for treating acute illnesses, effectively rendering them useless.
    After repeated demands, only 200,000,000,000 yuan of the first batch of 1,000,000,000,000 yuan in project funds was received by July 10th.
    Therefore, even Luo Huishi, a county-level relief expert, felt deeply that the supply and relief matters had fallen far behind the needs of the project after inspecting the levee repair projects in Juancheng, Fanxian, and Shouzhang counties on June 13th. He said: "We must go to Nanjing to urge those gentlemen sitting at large desks." In fact, the gentlemen of the Executive Yuan were not just sitting at large desks; weren't they desperately urging to speed up the closing of the breach?
    The Executive Yuan, determined to release water and harm the residents along the river in the Liberated Areas, first engaged in mutual buck-passing regarding our reasonable demands and urging. In early June, our representative Wang Xiaoyi and others went to Nanjing and discussed with Xue Dubi and Jiang Tingfu five times, urging the allocation of the first batch of 1,000,000,000,000 yuan in project funds. Xue initially disregarded the agreement and shirked responsibility, saying that the Executive Yuan should be responsible for raising the funds, while Jiang Tingfu then pushed it to the Yellow River Commission, saying that the Executive Yuan had no such funds and needed approval from the Executive Yuan, and the Yellow River Commission would plan, and then the Executive Yuan could allocate it on their behalf. After they could no longer push it away, Xue Dubi pushed it to Kaifeng, saying that 30 billion yuan in project funds had been allocated to the Kaifeng Yellow River Commission. This was pushed back and forth repeatedly.
    When there was really nowhere to push it, they changed to the method of delay. They delayed the time by using the excuses of "procedures," "systems," "preparations," "investigations," and so on. Investigators were dispatched late, the preparation period was extended indefinitely, and Wang Hechen, the director of the Executive Yuan's office in Heze in charge of handling relocation fees, only arrived in Heze on June 20th, and still had to "prepare" to establish an agency, and after the agency was established, he had to conduct an "investigation" again. In reality, one group of people left, and another group of people came. They "investigated" today, and "investigated" tomorrow. More than ten groups of people inspected the levee repair project in Heze in June alone, but they still had to continue to "visit" and "investigate."
    When they could no longer delay, they shamelessly denied it. At the end of June, when a portion of the project funds was allocated from Nanjing to Kaifeng, when our representative urged its rapid allocation, they created extraneous issues by claiming that it "must wait for the committee's decision" before it could be allocated. And this so-called committee was unilaterally instructed by the Executive Yuan on June 26th, consisting of representatives from the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan, the Yellow River Commission, and UNRRA, without the participation of representatives from the Liberated Areas. The issues of engineering standards and worker treatment had already been agreed upon with the representative of the Yellow River Commission, but they still had to be discussed by this committee. Finally, they simply refused to acknowledge this batch of project funds that they had previously acknowledged. They also wanted to change the grain and flour to soybean flour and coarse grains.
    As a result of the Executive Yuan's delay in supplying materials, according to statistics at the end of July, the amount of flour transported was less than half of the first batch of grain, and as for the subsequent 16,200 tons of grain, there was of course no way to talk about it. The promised supply of rock drills, transport vehicles, road rollers, etc., had not been transported at all. As for the first batch of 100 billion yuan in project funds, 8 billion yuan is still owed to this day. The 15 billion yuan in relocation fees and the subsequent 30 billion yuan in project funds have not been allocated at all to date.
    The Executive Yuan, with its rogue behavior, violated the agreement and did not provide river management materials, causing our area's river works to not be dredged. At this time, they joined forces to close the breach and release water. This was naturally not for river management, but a planned act to drown the seven million people along the river in our area.

　　千方百计淹害人民
    ——行总推拖供给治河物资纪实
    西民
    “解放区执行了百分之百，而国民党政府则等于零。”这是黄委会工务长张季春先生，在去年六月二十日视察黄河全线复堤工程归来后，对双方执行南京协议的程度，所加的公正评论。虽然此后经我方一再催促与抗议，行总会陆续缓慢地又运来一部分物资，但这和工程的紧急需要来比，张季春先生的话，今天依然有他的现实性。
    按照南京协议及上海协议的规定，行总联总及全国黄委会应供给我方第一批工粮面粉六千吨（以后增至二万五千吨），工款一百万万元，迁移救济费一百五十万万元，以及治河工程所急要之器材，医药等。但是，行总等却始终采用赖、推、拖的办法，一再破坏两次协议。
    关于工粮面粉的供应，联总及行总会与我方在汴规定，应于七月十五日前运到施工区八千八百吨。六月二日，塔德在荷泽会议上亦正式宣布，要在六月四日把面粉运到各修防段；可是，到六月十日为止，才只运来一百吨。这时，我方复堤工程已全线动工，修堤工人已达廿三万名，每日需要工粮即在三万吨左右，尚不足一日之食用。经我代表在京、汴两地屡次催促，而行总依然继续拖延供给，到廿二日，运来之面粉也不过才有五百余吨，十二日内，共运来四百吨寥寥的数目，每日平均只有四十来吨，不足工人食用的七分之一。直至七月七日，距规定运来（八千八百吨面粉之最后日期七月十五日只剩八天了，可是，统共才运到二千二百吨，仅为规定数目的四分之一。
    一切急需的治河器材，除在开工前送来汽车四部和两套测量仪器（经纬仪两架已破毁不能用）外，其他器材至六月底尚未运来分毫。在七月份我区修堤工程被迫停工后，始迟迟运到荷泽推土车一百八十八辆，铁锹一千零三把。
    修堤工人因无面粉食用，不得不以高粱充饥，在烈日下紧张修堤，夜间没有宿处，只好在地里露营。行总和联总前本应允拨发一部分帐蓬，然而，也是杳如黄鹤，不见运到。因此各种急性传染病迅速蔓延而无法制止，鄄城段七天中即病倒九百人，郓北段几天内也病倒六百人，占该县修堤工人总数的百分之四十三。行总和联总所应供给的药品，却拖延不肯运来，最后，勉强送来了几十小包，不仅数量太少，且医治急性病的针剂根本没有，实际上无补于事。
    第一批工款一百万万元，几经催索，到七月十日，才收到二十万万元。
    因此，连县总救济专家罗惠士，于六月十三日视察了鄄城、范县、寿张各县修堤工程后，也深感供给及救济事宜已远落在工程需要的后面。他曾这样说：“我们要去南京，督促那些坐在大办公桌上的先生们。”其实，行总的那些先生们何尝只是坐在大办公桌上的，他们不是正在拚命的督促加紧堵口么？
    决心要放水淹害解放区沿河居民的行总，对于我方合理的要求与催促，首先是互相推诿。六月初，我代表王笑一等又到了南京，分别与薛笃弼及蒋廷黻商谈五次，催拨一百万万元的第一批工款。薛初则不顾协议，推诿说应由行总负责筹拨，而蒋廷黻则又推到黄委会，稍行总无此款项，须经行政院核准，由黄委会筹划，行总始可代拨。以后推不过去了，薛笃弼又推到了开封，说工款已拨交开封黄委会三十亿元，这样一再的推下去。
    实在无地方可推了，就改用拖的办法。借口“手续”、“制度”、“筹备”，“调查”等等名目，来拖延时间。调查人员迟迟不派出，筹备期限无限制的延长，办理迁移费的行总驻荷办事处主任王贺宸，六月二十日才到荷泽，还要“筹备”成立机关，并在机关成立后，又要进行“调查”一番。实际上则是去了一批人，又来了一批人，今天“调查”，明天“调查”，仅六月份内来荷视察修堤工程的就十起以上，但依然还是要继续“访问”，“调查”。
    拖也拖不下去了，就无耻抵赖起来。六月底由南京拨至开封的一部工款，当我代表催其迅速拨付时，竟节外生枝地借口“须候委员会决定”始能拨发。而这个所谓委员会，则是行总于六月二十六日片面指令，由行总河南分署、黄委会及联总三方代表组成，并无解放区代表参加的。关于工程标准及工人待遇问题，早已与黄委会代表商定，可是，也竟要再由这个委员来负责商定了。最后，对先前承认了的这批工款索性就不想承认了。工粮面粉也想改为豆粉和杂粮。
    由于行总这样拖延供给的结果，据七月底的统计，运来的面粉不足第一批工粮的一半，至于后继工粮一万六千二百吨，当然更无从谈起。所应允供给的开山机，运输汽车、压道机等等，根本没有运来一件。至于第一批工款一百亿元，至今仍差八亿元。一百五十亿迁移费和后继工款三百亿，则迄今尚未拨来分文。
    行总以其无赖行为，破坏协议，不给治河物资，致使我区河工未浚，而他们却于此时合龙放水，这自然不是什么为了治河，而是有计划的淹害我沿河七百万人民。
