　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th: During interviews with the officers of the 239th Regiment of the 80th Brigade of the Rapid Column, who surrendered during the Lu Nan Campaign, they all expressed satisfaction with their regimental commander, Chen Weijin, for immediately sounding the bugle to assemble and lay down their arms after being surrounded, rejoicing that they were spared unnecessary sacrifice. Regiment Commander Chen, a native of Nan'an, Fujian, claimed to have been a soldier for over twenty years and expressed great admiration for the People's Liberation Army's brave fighting and strict discipline. His deputy regimental commander, Chen Zhixue, said, "Our Rapid Column was Chiang Kai-shek's 'diamond' force, not to be used until a critical moment. This time, the entire Rapid Column was annihilated; he should realize something!"
　　Xinhua News Agency, Lu Nan Front, 16th: This reporter followed the army into the newly recovered city of Yixian at 2:00 AM on the 12th. Even at night, the residents of the city crowded the streets to welcome the People's Liberation Army, who had come to liberate them. Armed militiamen searched everywhere for the fleeing Chiang soldiers. When a column of militiamen arrived in front of the Chiang's county government prison, where people were being detained, they immediately opened the prison gates and released innocent civilians who had been imprisoned. One detainee, Li Zhufa, said, "We are all honest farmers, but he (referring to the Chiang soldiers) insisted on calling us 'secretly communicating with the Eighth Route Army' and arrested us. Many have been shot to death by them." Yixian was occupied by the Chiang army on October 8th of last year. After more than three months of devastation, the city was a scene of desolation, and the residents' food had been completely plundered. When this reporter entered the city, personnel from the democratic government were working through the night to comfort the disaster victims and provide relief.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: The city of Huai'an, after three months of occupation by the Chiang army, had become a smog-filled, ghostly world. The streets and alleys were plastered with treasonous, anti-communist slogans such as "Sino-American Cooperation to Suppress the Communist Bandits." The market was flooded with American goods, and the grain stores were also stockpiling American dried noodles. During holidays, the Chiang army and Chiang's secret agents would force all merchants to display crossed Chinese and American flags. Prostitutes who had "returned home" with the Chiang army from places such as Yangzhou and Zhenjiang also flooded the city. Traitorous elements such as Xu Jingjiao, of the former puppet Social Welfare Committee, and Jiang Boxuan, an intelligence officer of the enemy's special military police force, frequented the county government and were revered as first-class gentry, attending every meeting. The citizens were surprised and said, "The democratic government prosecutes these traitors, but Chiang Kai-shek reveres them as honored guests. What is the reason for this?" Another replied, "Isn't the current county magistrate, Niu Zuoshan, the former puppet county magistrate!"

　　鲁南战役放下武器军官敬佩我军歼灭快速纵队
    【新华社山东十六日电】记者与此次鲁南战役放下武器之快速纵队八十旅二三九团全体军官相谈之间，他们对团长陈维金受包围后，即吹号集合放下武器之举，均表满意，庆幸自己免于无谓牺牲。陈团长福建南安人，自称戎马二十余年，对人民解放军作战英勇，纪律严明，极表敬佩。其副团长陈志学谈：“我们快速纵队是蒋介石的金钢钻部队，非到紧要关头不用，这次快速纵队全部被歼，他应该有所觉悟吧”！
    【新华社鲁南前线十六日电】记者随军于十二日晨二时进入刚收复之峄县城，虽在夜间，城内居民均拥挤街头，欢迎解救他们的人民解放军。武装的民兵们则四处搜索溃散的蒋军，一列民兵队伍行至蒋记县政府拘禁人民之监狱前时，立将监狱大门打开，释放被囚之无辜良民。一个被拘禁的李柱发说：“俺们都是老实的庄稼汉，硬被他（指蒋军）说成‘私通八路’拘捕进来，有许多都遭到他们的枪杀了。”峄县是去年十月八日被蒋军侵占的，经过三个多月的蹂躏，城内满目凄凉，居民食物搜索殆尽。当记者进城时，民主政府人员正连夜安抚灾民，进行救济。
    【新华社华中十六日电】蒋军侵占三个月后的淮安城，已成了一个乌烟瘴气的鬼世界，大街小巷满贴着“中美合作共剿奸匪”的卖国反共标语，市面上美货充斥，粮行里也囤着美国干面。每逢节日，蒋军蒋特即勒令各商户将中美国旗交叉悬挂。从扬州、镇江等地随蒋军“还乡”的娼妓，亦充斥该城。前伪社会福利委员会徐镜椒及敌特宪兵队情报员蒋伯宣等奸逆分子，均出入县府，被尊为第一流士绅，每开会必到，市民们诧异道：“民主政府把这些汉奸法办，蒋介石把他们尊为上宾，是什么道理？”另一个回答说：“现在的县长牛作善，不就是过去的伪县长吗！”
