Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Shanghai reports: Tea and silk, which formerly occupied an important position in China's exports, have both shown a declining trend in overseas markets last year due to the constraints of the Chiang government's civil war and unreasonable economic policies. Tea exports last year, including Taiwan, were only 100,000 metric tons, which is one-fifth of the pre-war export volume (excluding Taiwan). However, in terms of new tea, it was less than 2% (the pre-war export volume of new tea accounted for 80% of the total export volume of that year). Therefore, last year's tea exports were the lowest in China's tea export history. Last year, tea was mostly exported to Egypt, Afghanistan, and Iran. The original American market has been seized by Japan and India. Tea merchants still have 100,000 dan of new tea from last year in stock. According to statistics on silk exports, over 10,000 bales were exported throughout the year. Among them, 3,000 bales of raw silk were shipped to the United States and 2,000 bales were sold to India, while exports of new silk were less than 4,000 bales. The reason for the sluggish export of raw silk is that the exchange rate set by the Chiang government is too low, making Chinese silk too expensive in foreign countries, unable to compete with Japanese silk and American rayon. The Nanyang Islands and India, which were formerly the main markets for Chinese silk, have been seized by Japan and the United States. The American market has also been almost entirely lost.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Shanghai reports: On the 7th of this month, more than 40 representatives of Shanghai import and export firms held a symposium to discuss the various difficulties currently encountered by the industry. Zhang Huanzhang, chairman of the industry association, said: "Since the government's import management regulations were announced, the entire industry has been virtually forced to shut down." An export industry magnate told a reporter from Wenhui Daily: The import management regulations promulgated by the Chiang government are rumored to have been drafted by a foreigner named Ujes, so these measures are virtually protecting foreign merchants and oppressing Chinese merchants.

    蒋政府压低外汇汇率
    我国茶丝业一蹶不振
    上海出入口商抨击蒋输入管理办法
    【新华社延安二十八日电】沪讯：向占我国出口重要位置的茶丝，去年外销市场因受蒋政府内战及不合理的经济政策束缚，均呈一蹶不振现象。去年茶叶外销，包括台湾在内仅十万公担，为战前外销量（台湾不在内）的五分之一，但以新茶来说还不足百分之二（战前新茶输出量为当年输出量的百分之八十），故去年茶叶出口为中国茶叶外销量最低的一年。去年茶叶多输往埃及、阿富汗、伊朗，原有之美国市场已为日本印度所夺，目前茶商尚存有去年新茶十万担。据出口蚕丝统计，去年全年出口万余包，内除丝三千包运美，二千包销印，而新丝外销不满四千包。蚕线外销不振原因，为蒋政府所定外汇率过低，华丝在国外售价过高，无法与日丝及美人造丝竞争。向为华丝主要市场的南洋群岛、印度，已为日美两国所夺，美国市场亦几已全部丧失。
    【新华社延安二十日电】沪讯：本月七日上海出入口商行代表四十余人举行座谈会，商讨联业目前所遭遇之种种困难，该业公会理事长张焕章说：“自政府管理输入办法公布后，整个工业即无形被迫停止”。出口业巨子向文汇报记者谈称：蒋政府颁布之输入管理办法，传系由一外人名乌杰斯者主持起草，故此项办法无形中保护洋商压迫华商。
