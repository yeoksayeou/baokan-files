Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd - Regarding the "peace talk" smokescreen that Chiang Kai-shek is currently vigorously promoting in Nanjing, the *Liberation Daily* editorial on the 21st denounces it as a new kind of swindle.

The editorial, after reviewing the serious military, political, financial, and economic difficulties Chiang Kai-shek is currently encountering, points out: Precisely because of these reasons, therefore, "under the suggestion of the American reactionaries, a 'peace talk' plan was decided upon, so they released trial balloons, put on a show, and engaged in enticement and probing, displaying themselves as a Buddha-like figure earnestly seeking 'peace and democracy'; and in reality, Chiang Kai-shek indeed wants to use this trick to paralyze the Chinese people, especially the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, in order to gain time for military rest, consolidate the places already occupied, replenish troops, and launch a new offensive. Politically, he attempts to ease domestic and international opposition, obtain loans and other aid from the United States with the false pretense of so-called 'peaceful unification' and a so-called 'democratic coalition government,' to continue expanding the civil war and consolidate his dictatorial and autocratic rule. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek has completely ignored the two minimum demands raised by the CCP, namely, abolishing the pseudo-constitution and restoring the military positions as of January 13th of last year, even "not giving them any consideration at all" (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th), and instead simply put forward his so-called 'plan,' preparing to create a basis for his crimes of sabotaging the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference under the guise of 'peaceful consultation.' Regarding this point, the United States' Associated Press has already revealed a little secret, reporting that "the government hopes to issue a ceasefire order first," and claiming: "The government mainly wants to solve the issues of reorganizing the army and restoring transportation, with both sides' troops maintaining their current positions, and then exercising control over locations on major railways."

This is the true content of Chiang Kai-shek's current "peace talk."

The editorial continued: "Over the past year, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of the United States government, has broken the January ceasefire order, invaded 179,000 square kilometers of land in the Liberated Areas, and 165 cities. He also completely tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, intensified fascist autocratic rule, and convened a pseudo-'National Assembly' to formulate a pseudo-constitution. Through Chiang Kai-shek's own hands, the door to peaceful negotiation was finally closed."

The editorial then asked: "With such a person who not only has no credibility but also regards betrayal as a natural honor, coupled with an equally untrustworthy American 'mediator' directing the play, and now they are actually shouting about 'peace' again, isn't this just seeing a ghost?! How can it gain the slightest trust from the CCP and the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, as well as the people of the whole country!?"

The editorial used a metaphor to describe the meaning of this "peace talk": "Only when a swindler meets a blind man does he have the opportunity to boast about the cleverness of his old tricks. For those with clear eyes, learning from one loss increases wisdom. When encountering a swindler trying to swindle again, one can simply treat it with scorn! Chiang Kai-shek's current 'peace' offensive is really deceiving people too much, and its foolishness is truly beyond reach."

Finally, the editorial stated: "The CCP and the Chinese people resolutely and urgently demand true democracy. Based on their own painful experience, they are determined to expose Chiang Kai-shek's new swindle and strive through their own efforts to achieve the aforementioned two minimum demands, laying the foundation for true peace and democracy, and will not stop until the goal is achieved!"

### 蒋美布置“和谈”新骗局  全国人民当嗤之以鼻  解放日报发表社论痛斥

　　蒋美布置“和谈”新骗局
    全国人民当嗤之以鼻
    解放日报发表社论痛斥
    【新华社延安二十二日电】对于蒋介石目前正在南京大肆渲染的“和谈”烟幕，解放日报二十一日社论特斥之为一种新的骗局。
    社论回溯了蒋介石目前所遭遇到的军事、政治、财政经济的严重困难以后，指出：正因为此原因，所以，“由美国反动派的提示，定下了一条“和谈”之计，于是放空气，装样子，拉拢试探，显得自己是一意力求“和平民主”的弥陀佛模样；而且实际上，蒋介石也确乎想借此一手麻痹中国人民，尤其是解放区军民，以便军事上求得休息的时间，巩固已占的地方，补充军队，重新进攻。在政治上则企图缓和国内外的反对，以所谓“和平统一”和所谓“民主联合政府”的假牌照，取得美国的借款和其他援助，以继续扩大内战，巩固其独裁专制的统治。因此，蒋介石对中共所提两项最低要求，即取消伪宪和恢复去年一月十三日军事位置，竟然置之不理，甚至根本“未予考虑”（十四日中央社电），而单单提出他的所谓“方案”来，准备在“和平协商”的方式下为其破坏停战令与政协决议的罪行制造根据。关于这一点，美国合众社已泄露了一点天机，它报导“政府希望先颁布停战令”，并称：“政府主要想解决整编军队与恢复交通问题，双方部队维持目前位置，然后对主要铁路上地点进行管制。”
    这就是蒋介石这次“和谈”的真实内容。
    社论继称：“一年以来，蒋介石在美国政府的支持下破坏了一月停战令，侵占了解放区十七万九千平方公里的土地，和一百六十五个城市，他又彻底撕毁了政协决议，加紧法西斯专制统治，并召开伪‘国大’，制定伪宪法，经过蒋介石自己的手，最后关闭了和平协商之门。”
    社论于是问道：“以这样一个不仅毫无信义而且以背信弃义为当然荣耀的人，再加上一个同样毫无信义的美国‘调人’来导演，现在居然又嚷起‘和平’来了，这岂不是活见鬼！？它那能取得中共和解放区军民以及全国人民的丝毫信任！？”
    社论用了一个比喻来描述这次“和谈”的意义道：“骗子碰到瞎子，才有机会夸耀其老套骗术的高明。对于明眼人，则吃一次亏长一分智，遇到骗子再骗人，大可以嗤之以鼻！蒋介石这番发动的‘和平’攻势，实在是欺人太甚，而其愚也诚不可及。”
    最后，社论表示：“中共和中国人民坚决和急迫地要求真正的民主，他们凭着自己的惨痛经验，决计一定要揭穿蒋介石的新骗局，并以自己的努力争取上述两项最低要求的实现，奠定真正和平民主的基础，不达目的不止！”
