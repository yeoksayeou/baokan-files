From our newspaper's dispatch from Wei County on the 9th:

　　The 100,000 emancipated peasants in Chengan and Cixian counties, located on the Pinghan Railway Line, have universally launched a war preparation and martial arts practice movement. 1,200 village peasant association representatives and militia squad leaders from the county have flocked to training classes one after another. Having eliminated illusions of peace and complacency, a swearing-in movement has swept from the training classes to the villages. Cadres have sworn to resolutely lead the masses in struggle, further strengthening the masses' confidence in defending the fruits of their emancipation. Each village has launched a political offensive against special agents and rumor-mongers, suppressing evil and exposing rumors. Individual education has been given to landlords who have been liquidated, explaining that as long as they abide by the law and stand with the peasants in the future, their lives and property will be guaranteed. The families of six escaped landlords, including Qiao Jun and Xu Ziqi, who joined the Chiang Kai-shek army's "Homecoming Corps," signed agreements with the peasant association, guaranteeing that they would not contact them or do bad things. The masses removed the labels of "traitors" from petty criminals and puppet soldiers, allowing them to reform themselves. After more than 170 puppet personnel in Dongguan confessed and repented, they turned over along with the masses. Villages in Chengan have fortress-like buildings, most of which have now been demolished. All public and private grain and cotton in the county has been completely hidden, and mass leaders are checking house by house. Each village has paid special attention to organizing demolition operations, with one demolition squad organized for each company, specializing in demolition activities. Militia member Yuan Fuxiu leads the manufacturing of landmines, even neglecting to eat. In the Western Small District of the First District, militia members regularly check household registrations to prevent bad people from sneaking in. The First District has begun to register livestock and vehicles, repair stretchers, and organize stretcher and transport teams, ready to participate in the war at any time. Some villages are combining war preparations with clearing up the fruits of victory, resolving outstanding cases, and solving internal problems to enhance the masses' war preparation morale and strengthen the connection between mass leaders and the masses, clearing away obstacles to war preparation. District × has adopted a division of labor method, with the elderly liquidating the fruits of victory, the young and strong hiding grain, and the children's corps standing guard. The County Command calls on all cadres and mass leaders to maintain close ties with the masses, "the county not leaving the county, the district not leaving the district," leading the masses and militia in persisting in guerrilla warfare in their own county and annihilating the invaders. County Magistrate Zhao said, "Everyone has the confidence to fight Chiang Kai-shek to the death."

From our newspaper's dispatch from Wei County on the 9th:

　　In Shangcheng District, Chengan and Cixian, after the emancipation movement, 270 young and middle-aged men formed a "Peasant Turn-Over Camp" to protect the fields and homes in three days. A sixty-year-old woman from Huanglong Village sent her son to join the army; a newlywed bride sent the nineteen-year-old hero Han Kui to join the army, saying generously, "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, I wouldn't be able to marry you. Come back in triumph, and we'll be reunited." Old Man Sun Sizhong led his son to everyone and said, "We suffered so much in the past, and experienced so many difficulties. If Chiang Kai-shek comes, our land will be lost. If you don't join the Turn-Over Camp, you're not my son."
