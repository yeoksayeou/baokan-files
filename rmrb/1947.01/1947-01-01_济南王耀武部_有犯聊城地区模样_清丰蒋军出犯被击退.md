    Jinan's Wang Yaowu's troops, specifically Sun Huancai's entire 111th Division and Wang's special service brigade, totaling more than 5,000 men, occupied the Panjiadian area east of Renping on the 28th from Jinan, via the Jingji River, appearing to be advancing toward our Liaocheng area. Our local Eighth Route Army is currently blocking them. Furthermore, on the 29th, over a hundred enemy troops from Qingfeng attacked the area south of Gaobao (20 li north of Qingfeng), burning, killing, and looting, behaving like bandits. A certain unit of our army immediately struck a heavy blow, killing or wounding over 20 enemy soldiers, seizing a portion of the spoils of victory. The remaining enemies fled south in panic.
