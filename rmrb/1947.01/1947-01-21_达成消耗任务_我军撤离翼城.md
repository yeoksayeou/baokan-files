　　Taiyue, 18th (reported by this newspaper) After the Eighth Route Army liberated Yicheng, Chiang's army stationed in southern Shanxi—Linfen felt greatly threatened. Therefore, it drew its First Brigade (remnants reorganized) from Lüliang and, in coordination with the remnants of the 71st and 67th Brigades of Linfen and the "Homecoming Corps" of Xiangling, etc., invaded from Dizhen in Linfen County and south of Xiangling on the 14th. Our military and civilians established a spiderweb-like defense to resist along the way. After three days of fierce fighting, our army proactively withdrew from Yicheng on the 17th after achieving the goal of attrition against the enemy.
