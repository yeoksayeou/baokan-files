    Raising Mass Awareness Through Question and Answer:
    Longping Holds a "Turning Over" Test
    [This Dispatch from Weixian, 6th of this month] The leaders in Longping put forward "Turning Over Test Questions", calling on cadres to lead the masses, using question and answer format to carry out discussions, in order to raise the consciousness of the masses. The original questions are as follows: 1. Why are you poor? Don't you work hard all day long? 2. Is poverty and wealth determined by fate? Whose blood and sweat is the landlord enjoying? 3. Why shouldn't we struggle against middle peasants? 4. Should we struggle against landlords? Isn't it against our "conscience"? 5. Do you think the days of turning over can last? Why? 6. Who is leading the poor to turn over? 7. How can we defend our right to land reform gains? Who wants to take away our means of living? 8. Do you know what Li Tingzheng, Liu Fengruan, and Du Huaiwu (Chiang's secret agents) are doing? Do you know what a special agent is? 9. How do you define thorough emancipation? What do you feel is good or bad about this year? 10. Do you have the right to manage what rural women are doing? Why? 11. What makes a good cadre? If a cadre makes a mistake, dare you criticize him? 12. How do you plan to develop production and become prosperous?
