Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th: Jiang Bokun, Director of the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau, recently issued a statement explaining the progress of the Yellow River dike restoration project in the Bohai region. He also issued a warning, resolutely opposing the Kuomintang's unauthorized damming and water release. Jiang stated that the Kuomintang government must cease damming, continue to allocate funds for the project, complete the dike restoration, and promptly allocate relocation funds for residents along the river. The Nanjing agreement stipulated that the national treasury would allocate 1.8 million billion legal tender to Shandong and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan regions, but not a single cent has been received to date. Regarding wages, food rations, and materials stipulated in past agreements, Shandong has only received 2,600 tons of flour and 100 billion legal tender over the past eight months, with very few shovels and gasoline, far from sufficient. In the Bohai region alone, there are 43 dangerous sections, and the entire project requires approximately 162 million catties of wages and food rations, and 250,000 billion Northern currency for materials. In the past eight months, the Bohai region has mobilized people from over a dozen counties to complete more than 6 million cubic meters of earthwork, borrowing over 40 million catties of wages and food rations. Jiang proposed the formation of a three-person team composed of representatives from both sides and UNRRA in the border area between the Liberated Areas and the KMT-controlled areas to effectively ensure that the KMT side does not sabotage the dike restoration project in the Liberated Areas. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek's agents repeatedly killed dike-repairing workers in Jiyang and other places, and US-made Chiang planes bombed ships carrying Yellow River control and relief supplies in the Xiaoqing River area. Moreover, Chiang's troops successively robbed approximately 300,000 catties of wage flour in Guangrao and other places.

    山东河务局长发表谈话
    反对蒋介石擅自放水
    要求速拨工款迁移费
    【新华社山东四日电】山东省河务局江钵坤局长顷发表谈话，说明渤海区黄河复堤工程进行情形，并提出警告，坚决反对国民党方面擅自堵口放水。江氏声称：国民党政府必须停止堵口，继续拨付工程用费，完成复堤工程，并应迅速拨付河道居民迁移费。此款南京协议规定由国库拨法币一百八十万万元给山东及冀鲁豫两区，但至今未见分文。关于过去协议中规定的工资工粮及器材，八个月来山东仅收到面粉二千六百吨，法币十万万元，铁锹汽油等极少，远不敷用，渤海区仅险工即达四十三处，全部工程须工资工粮约一亿六千二百余斤，器材二十五万万元北币，渤海区在过去八个月中曾动员十数县人民完成六百余万土方工程，借出工资粮四千余万斤。江氏提出在解放区与蒋管区交界地带由双方及联总派员组成三人小组，以切实保证蒋方不破坏解放区复堤工程。过去蒋介石特务曾迭次在济阳等地杀害修堤员工，美制蒋机且在小清河一带轰炸治黄救济物资船只，而蒋军复先后在广饶等地抢走工资面约三十万斤。
