    The Annihilation of the Enemy at Zhao Family Factory
    A Battle Sketch of the “Mount Tai” Unit
    Shi Hong
    On the tenth of last month, after our army completed the annihilation of the enemy at Loulou (under the jurisdiction of Tangyin), we actively withdrew from the area. The puppet Sun Dianying's 5th Column, 1st Regiment, 1st Battalion (original regiment), was simultaneously transferred from the east of the road to Zhao Family Factory (southwest of Loulou) and the Black Mountain area to garrison.

    The Chiang army was very arrogant, thinking we left because we were afraid of them. So, on New Year's Day evening, when we attacked Black Mountain, Battalion Commander Zhang Huanzhang (former 27th Regiment Commander) even said to his subordinates, "Don't be afraid, the militia just got a rotten district cadre team." But our "Mount Tai" troops rushed into the village on the afternoon of the 2nd. Platoon Leader Zhang Lianjin, leading dozens of people, charged wildly, confusing the enemy. Some fled to the mountain, and some were pushed into the battalion headquarters, a large stone building. The enemy at Black Mountain also fled back in a panic.

    At this time, Zhang Huanzhang was still very stubborn. He estimated that we had two regiments. He knew he had four and a half companies, forty-six light and heavy machine guns, mortars, American-style infantry guns... As long as he held out until dawn, reinforcements would arrive, and the Eighth Route Army would retreat. At the same time, two political instructors (specializing in espionage) had just been sent down. He wanted to seize this "good opportunity" to show off and raise his own status.

    Unexpectedly, the reinforcements from Guxian, Hebi, and Shijia Village were all beaten back. By dawn, he wanted to find a way to escape, but two breakouts failed.

    Fearing being defeated one by one, he concentrated his troops on a stone stockade less than 150 meters in diameter. This made him a turtle in a jar, left to await the people's judgment.

    At 3:00 PM, two airplanes circled a few times like they were attending a funeral, and then flew south. At that moment, we launched a general offensive.

    Look, they charged forward, each one better than the last. The actions of the 11th Company of the 43rd Unit were just like field exercises. Squad Leader Zhang Qingshui and Ru Huashui, Shen Fawang carried bamboo ladders, and Wang Falong (the squad leader) led the grenade-throwing team. From forty meters away, they threw and charged. Enemy grenades landed around them. They picked them up and threw them back. If there wasn't time, they just kicked them away. In just a few minutes, they approached the stone stockade. With their backs against the wall, they threw grenades into the stockade. In the smoke of the grenade explosions, the ladder team raised the ladders high. Wang Falong was the first to climb up the ladder. When he was about to reach the third rung, he was unfortunately shot down by the enemy.

    "The squad leader is wounded, avenge the squad leader!" As the deputy squad leader shouted, another volley of grenades was thrown in. Then, Li Longbao said, "Sixth Squad, follow me!" In an instant, everyone was standing on the stone stockade.

    The stockade was immediately thrown into chaos. Zhang Huanzhang, seeing the troops all over the mountains and plains, ran out of the high building in panic. At this moment, our sharpshooter shot through his arm with one shot, and he had to scurry back to his lair.

    As soon as the 9th Company arrived at the foot of the stone stockade, the enemy threw down seven or eight grenades. The comrades were furious. Niu Bangfan held the ladder, and Pang Baoshun, Liu Quanzhang, and Liu Jinzheng climbed the stockade wall one after another. Volleys of grenades made the enemy soldiers cry out in agony. "Don't shoot, I surrender!" You shouted, and he yelled, it was a clamorous mess. They scrambled to throw their guns out of the stockade, looking from afar like they were throwing firewood.

    At this time, the blockhouse in the stockade was ignited by our anti-tank guns captured from the enemy. The raging flames soared into the sky. The troops surrounding the stone stockade swarmed and crowded like ants. The old folks watching the battle from the surrounding high mountains stood up to watch the excitement, and the enemy at Shijia Village, who had fought us for a day, seemed to see their own doom, stopped fighting, and stared blankly at the demise of the enemy soldiers at Zhao Family Factory.

    Shells exploded in the blockhouse, and bullets whizzed through the enemy soldiers. The enemy soldiers in the fire shouted, "Help! Help!" Those who were lucky enough to escape from the fire crawled all over the stockade wall like locusts, their faces blackened, their hair burned bald, some stripping naked, still clinging to the stockade wall.

    The total number of enemies garrisoning Zhao Family Factory this time was more than 480. Including the wounded Zhang Huanzhang, the battalion commander with the injured right arm, 300 were captured by us. The remaining 180 all died alive in the tortoise shell they had made themselves.

    赵家厂敌人的聚歼
    “泰山”部战斗速写
    史洪
    上月十日，我军完成歼灭鹿楼（汤阴属）敌人后，就主动地撤离该地，伪孙殿英五纵队一团一营（原团），便于同时，由路东调至赵家厂（鹿楼西南）、黑山一带驻防。
    蒋军很自大，以为我们离开是怕他，所以在元旦日晚上，当我攻打黑山时，营长张焕章（原二十七团长）还对他的部下说：“不要怕，民兵又配了个烂区干队。”但我们的“泰山”部队于二日下午便冲进村内，排长张连金，带着几十个人，横冲直撞，搞得敌人晕头转向，一部分逃上山岗，一部分被压进营部大青石楼房，黑山的敌人也狼狈的逃跑回来。
    这时，张焕章仍然很顽强，他估计我们有两个团，他晓得自己有四个半连，有四十六挺轻、重机枪，有迫击炮，有美式步炮……只要顶到天明，援兵一到，八路军就会退的。同时，上面刚派下两个政治指导员（专干特务工作），他想乘此“良机”卖弄一手，借以提高自己的身价。
    不料，固县、鹤壁、施家沟的援兵统统被打退了，到天明他想设法脱身，但是，两次突围却都未得逞。
    他怕被我们各个击破，把队伍集中到一个方圆不及百五十米的石寨上。这一下他可变成了瓮中之鳌，只好等候着人民的裁判。
    下午三点钟，两架飞机来像吊丧式的转了几个圈子，一直向南面飞去，就在这时我们发动了总攻。
    看吧，冲起来真是一个赛过一个，四三部队十一连的动作，简直如打野外一样。一班副张清水和茹花水、申发旺抬着竹梯，王发龙（班长）带着投弹组，从四十米以外，边投边冲，敌人手榴弹落在他们的身边，他们拾起来又投过去，来不及的，就一脚踢开，三两分钟他们便接近了石寨。背靠着墙，向寨内投弹，架梯组在手榴弹爆炸的烟雾里，把梯子高高的竖了起来，王发龙第一个爬上梯去，快要爬到顶上第三路时，不幸被敌人打下来了。
    “班长负伤了，给班长报仇吧”；副班长一喊，又投进一排手榴弹。接着李龙保就说：“六班跟我走，”刹那间，一个个都站在石寨上了。
    寨子里立刻乱起来。张焕章一见满山遍野的队伍，便惊惶地从高楼里跑出来，这时——我们的神枪手一枪打穿了他的胳膀，他只得窜回自己的窠穴。
    九连刚到石寨下，敌人投下了七八个手榴弹，同志们都气极了，牛邦范把着梯子，庞保顺、刘全章、刘金正次第登上寨墙，一排排的手榴弹，打得敌兵呼爹唤娘，“不要打，我缴枪！”你也喊，他也叫，简直嚷成了一片。他们争着把枪由寨内往外投，远远的望去，如投劈柴一般。
    这时，寨内的炮楼，被我们从敌人手里夺来的战防枪打燃了，熊熊的火焰直上云霄，石寨周围的部队，如蚂蚁般的乱钻乱挤，四边高山上观战的老百姓，站起来看热闹，和我们对打一天的施家沟敌人，仿佛也见到了自己的厄运，停止了战斗，眼巴巴的望着赵家厂敌兵的灭亡。
    炮弹在炮楼内轰轰爆炸，炸弹子弹在敌兵身上不时的作响，在火中的敌兵，乱喊着“救命！救命！”侥幸从火中逃出来的，如蝗蝻般的爬满寨墙，脸是黑黑的，头发烧得秃光，有的脱光屁股，又爬在寨墙上。
    这次驻守赵家厂的敌人总共是四百八十多名，被我俘虏的连那个右臂受伤的张焕章营长在内，共有三百名，其余一百八十人都活活的死在他们自己作成的乌龟壳里了。
