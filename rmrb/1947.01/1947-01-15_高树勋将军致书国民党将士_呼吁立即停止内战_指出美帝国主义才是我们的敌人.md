　　General Gao Shuxun Writes to Kuomintang Soldiers and Generals
　　Urging an Immediate End to the Civil War
　　Pointing Out that American Imperialism is Our Enemy
　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] General Gao Shuxun recently issued a letter to Kuomintang soldiers and generals for the New Year, calling for an end to the civil war. The original text is as follows:

　　To all Ministers, Commanders of War Zones, Commanders-in-Chief, Corps Commanders, Division Commanders, Brigade Commanders, and officers of all ranks in Nanjing!

　　Our country has reached a dangerous state of impoverishment, yet an unprecedented civil war is still raging fiercely. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party each hold their own views. The Kuomintang says the Communist Party is bad, and the Communist Party says the Kuomintang is bad. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, regardless of the policies of the various political parties, we only urgently demand not to be slaves to a foreign power. Our army has withdrawn from the civil war for more than a year. At the beginning of this new year, my feelings are mixed. I must offer a word of sincere advice to old friends who care about our army and to the officers and brothers of the Central Army. I hope you will not hesitate to come forward and teach us. If we calmly analyze the war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party from the facts, it will not be useless for our country, nation, and personal future.

　　During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party fought the Japanese in the enemy's rear, liberated vast territories from the Japanese invaders, and established a democratic government based on the Three Principles of the People. They not only protected the territory but also improved the people's livelihood, allowing the people in the liberated areas to live and work in peace and contentment, with ample food and clothing. What's wrong with that? After the Japanese surrendered, the Communist Party called for peace and suggested organizing a democratic coalition government led by various democratic parties to realize Sun Yat-sen's national construction plan and strive for national independence and autonomy. What's wrong with that? During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang collected donations and used foreign weapons to equip one or two million troops, saying it was for the purpose of resisting Japan. However, in reality, many troops did not fight the Japanese even once but were only preparing to "suppress the Communists." Isn't that still the truth?

　　After the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang, in collusion with the Japanese and puppet troops, immediately launched a civil war. The Japanese murderer Okamura Neiji is still employed as an advisor by Chairman Chiang to this day. Do the Japanese and puppet troops who slaughtered the Chinese people really seem better than the Communist Party who resisted Japan?

　　Now it is becoming increasingly clear that we sacrificed everything to drive away a Japanese imperialist, but before the wounds have healed, an American imperialist has entered. What is the difference between the atrocities of the American army in China and the atrocities of the Japanese in China? Aren't they equally raping, killing, and arbitrarily insulting the Chinese people?

　　Wang Jingwei sold China to the Japanese invaders, and we all opposed it. Chairman Chiang sold China to American imperialism. Should we welcome it? We call Wang Jingwei's troops wearing Japanese uniforms and carrying Japanese weapons puppet troops. What should we call the Central Army wearing American uniforms and carrying American weapons?

　　To say that the American army is helping the Chinese people to liberate themselves is deceiving the people. Even a three-year-old child would not believe it. What good is the liberation of the Chinese nation to the American imperialists? Can there be revolutionary imperialism in the world? In nearly half a year of civil war, China's sovereignty has been handed over to the Americans. Marshall has seized control of China's military and political power and has launched a "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" to allow American financial groups to freely operate in China, invade Chinese territory, and plunder Chinese resources. He has also launched a $400 million loan to keep the Chinese people forever under the American golden ticket, letting future generations be slaves to American imperialists forever.

　　In order to maintain the dictatorship of a minority, the Kuomintang disregards the survival of the country and wages a large-scale civil war, which has resulted in more than forty brigades being annihilated by the democratic people's armed forces and more than sixty senior generals being captured. The reason for fighting the civil war is that the Communist Party is destroying the democratic revolutionary cause of the Founding Father, but in reality, it is the Kuomintang that fears the Communist Party implementing the Founding Father's democratic cause. The facts are there. Isn't it clear yet? We are troops who have been influenced by Chairman Chiang and deeply know that everyone acknowledges Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, cherishes the enthusiasm of loving the country and saving the people, and sincerely wants to realize China's democratic revolution. At this critical moment of national survival, what kind of enemy should we be pointing the American imperialist weapons at? Those with insight should be able to choose for themselves. I hereby express my thoughts and wish you all a Happy New Year.

　　Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army, and all officers and soldiers. Zi Dong

　　高树勋将军致书国民党将士
    呼吁立即停止内战
  　指出美帝国主义才是我们的敌人
    【本报特讯】高树勋将军顷于新年发表致国民党将士书，呼吁停止内战，原文如次：
    南京各部院长、各战区司令长官、各总司令、各军长、师长、各旅团长、各级官长兄弟们！
    我们的国家已经到了民穷财尽的危险地步，然而空前内战，还在激烈的进行着。国共两党各执一词，国民党说共产党不好，共产党说国民党不好，我们以中国人民的立场，不管各政党的政策如何，只是迫切的要求不当亡国奴足矣。本军退出内战，已经一年有余，值些新年之始实是万感交集，不得不向关心本军的老朋友和中央部队的官长弟兄们进一忠言，尚祈不吝地远进而教之。国共两党的战争，我们冷静的从事实上加以分析，对我们的国家民族及个人前途都不会没有用处的。
    八年抗战，共产党在敌后抗战，从日寇手中解放广大领土，建立三民主义的民主政权，不仅保国土，而且改善民生，使解放区人民安居乐业，丰衣足食，有什么不好？日寇投降后，共产党要求和平，建议组织一个由各民主党派共同参加领导民主的联合政府，实现总理的建国方针，争取国家独立自主，有什么不好？国民党在抗战期间，拉丁派款，并用外国武器，装备起一两百万军队，说是为了抗日，然而实际上有许多部队并没有和日寇打过一次仗，只是准备着“剿共”，难道这还不是事实么？
    日寇投降后，国民党联合日寇伪军，立即发动内战，日寇凶手冈村宁次直到现在蒋主席还聘作顾问。难道屠杀中国人的日寇和伪军都比抗了日的共产党还好么？
    现在越来越明白了，我们牺牲一切，打走了一个日本帝国主义者，创伤未平，却又进来一个美帝国主义者，美军在中国的暴行与日寇在中国的暴行有何区别，不是同样地奸淫残杀，任意侮辱中国人民么？
    汪精卫把中国卖给日寇，我们大家反对。蒋主席把中国卖给美帝国主义，难道我们就欢迎么？我们把穿着日寇服装，拿着日寇武器的汪精卫的部队叫着伪军，我们把穿着美寇服装，拿着美寇武器的中央军应该叫作什么？
    要说美军是帮着中国人民解放，那是欺骗人民，连三岁小孩子都不会相信，试问中华民族解放与美帝国主义者有什么好处？世界上能有革命的帝国主义么？将近半年的内战，已将中国的主权打到美国人的手里去了，马歇尔有掌握中国的军政大权，便打出了一个“中美商约”，让美国财阀自由经营中国，侵占中国领土，掠夺中国资财，更打出了四十万万美金的借款，把中国人民永远压在美国的金票底下，让子孙永远给美帝国主义者当奴隶。
    国民党为保持少数人的独裁统治，竟不顾国家存亡，大打内战，已经把四十几个旅被民主的人民武装消灭了，六十几个高级将领被俘了，打内战的理由是说共产党破坏国父的民主革命事业，然实际上却是国民党害怕共产党实行国父的民主事业，事实俱在，难道还不明白么？我们却是受过蒋主席影响的部队，深知大家都承认总理遗教，怀着爱国救民的热忱，衷心的想实现中国的民主革命，际兹国家存亡的关头，我们拿着美帝国主义武器，究竟应该向着什么样的敌人开枪，明达者当能有所自择也，谨此布臆，顺颂年禧。
