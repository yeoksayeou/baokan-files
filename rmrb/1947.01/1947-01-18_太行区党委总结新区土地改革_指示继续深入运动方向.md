The Taihang District Party Committee Summarizes Land Reform in New Areas
Directs Continued Deepening of the Movement

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] Last December, after summarizing the mass emancipation movement in the Taihang District, the District Party Committee immediately instructed all counties to thoroughly implement mass emancipation to completely complete land reform before the spring plowing. The main points are excerpted as follows:

In the past year, the masses in the new areas of Taihang have been widely mobilized. In more than half of the new areas, feudalism has been basically eliminated, and the principle of "land to the tiller" has been realized. In nearly half of the new areas, a heated movement to eliminate feudal remnants is continuing. One year of experience has proven that in places where the ideological and practical problems of boldness, the mass line, cultivating poor and hired peasant backbones, uniting with middle peasants, mobilizing the vast number of peasants (including women and poor military dependents), and resolutely eliminating feudalism have been resolved, the movement has developed vigorously and rapidly. Otherwise, the movement will be hindered or new difficulties will be lurking. In order to thoroughly eliminate feudalism, implement "land to the tiller," support the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, and prepare for the upcoming large-scale production movement, we must deeply implement the mass emancipation movement. In areas where feudal forces have not yet been defeated, continue to vigorously carry out the movement and quickly realize "land to the tiller." In areas where feudalism has been basically eliminated and land reform has been realized, launch a mass emancipation inspection movement. In the coming period, the movement should especially face backward masses and backward villages, eliminate backwardness, unite the vast number of peasants, raise awareness, finally cut off the feudal tail, implement filling gaps and making up deficiencies, and complete thorough emancipation.

Recognize the Cunning Conspiracy of Landlords
Carry Out Thorough Emancipation Inspection

I. First of all, on the issue of how to treat landlords, we must thoroughly eliminate feudalism and realize "land to the tiller." Do not be constrained by any past traditional experience. According to years of experience in rent reduction and investigation, the landlord class is extremely cunning and stubborn. It has adopted various despicable and dirty means to preserve its economic and political status, relax and split the unity of the masses. We must resolutely strike at the various soft and hard counterattacks and all delaying resistance methods and attempts of feudal landlords, and completely crush their rule. Otherwise, the masses will not be able to thoroughly emancipate themselves. Therefore, when the movement in the new areas goes deeper, we must lead the masses to conduct in-depth inspections to see if the landlords have taken advantage of loopholes, preserved or disguised too much land, whether there is a phenomenon of regaining the fruits of struggle, whether they still retain a deceptive role in the masses and the sympathy of some of the masses politically, whether they still privately hide guns or other organized reactionary acts... Only on the basis of thoroughly resolving these problems can we talk about appropriately taking care of the landlords, leaving the landlords with a certain amount of land so that they can live. If the problem is not thoroughly resolved and the peasants are not thoroughly emancipated politically, ideologically, and economically, care will become a remnant of feudalism. However, after the masses have been fully emancipated, we must resolutely educate the masses and give appropriate care to small and medium landlords and all kinds of people. At the same time, in the peasant emancipation movement, we must closely unite the peasants themselves. That is, we must mobilize the poor and hired peasants (they are the vanguards and main force against feudalism) and unite the middle peasants (they account for more than 34% of the population, and anti-feudalism, participation in the army, and production cannot be separated from them). All practices that harm the peasants themselves (attacking middle peasants and despising "backward" peasants) are wrong. Therefore, whether the landlords have been eliminated (economically) and whether the feudal rule of the landlords has been crushed (politically) is the first standard of emancipation inspection; and whether the peasants (especially the poor and hired peasants) have been mobilized and whether the peasants are harmonious and united internally is the second standard of emancipation inspection. The lack of either of these two will prevent the thorough elimination of feudalism and the full mobilization of the masses, and the perfect realization of the goal of "land to the tiller."

Bold and Relaxed Mass Line Leadership Method

II. Regarding the leadership method of being bold and relaxed with the mass line. In the past year of the emancipation movement, especially after the movement to implement "land to the tiller," there has been great development. Its characteristics are top-down support and bottom-up collusion, brewing, and direct action, as well as the close integration of poor and hired peasants as the backbone to unite middle peasants throughout the entire movement process. This not only exerted the Party's leadership role in the mass emancipation movement, but also highly promoted the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses. In this way, the movement can develop vigorously and rapidly, with an overwhelming force, to destroy the political and economic rule of feudal landlords, breaking the narrow view that the mass line must be slowly carried out from the bottom up. The leadership style of being bold and relaxed with the mass line must grasp three basic links: First, draw a clear class line and clarify the struggle goal—eliminate feudalism, clarify your own camp—mobilize the vast number of peasants, that is, clarify who to let go of and who to let go of to fight against. Second, continuously open up the minds of the masses, enlighten the class hatred of the masses, make the peasants realize the justice of overthrowing the landlords and obtaining land, continuously improve the awareness of the peasants, make the peasants realize the justice of defending the fruits, and consciously participate in the armed forces. Make the peasants realize the connection between Old Chiang and Young Chiang, and consciously join the army and participate in the war to defeat Old Chiang's offensive. At the same time, enlighten their class feelings and class unity spirit, and understand the truth that "peasants all over the world are one family." Third, cultivate and train activists, especially poor and hired peasant activists, so that the entire movement has a strong mass backbone. The above three are most basic to cultivate and train a large number of mass activists. However, in leadership, we must not only pay attention to the reflections and emotions of activists, but also pay attention to the reflections and emotions of the vast masses outside the activists (the middle and backward). This point should be especially noted when the movement goes deeper. We must educate activists to pay attention to the reflections and requirements of the broad masses, pay attention to the growth and training of new activists. At the same time, different movements and different stages of the movement have different contents, and the camps, key points, and ideological issues of the struggle are also different. Therefore, when the movement turns, the leadership must pay special attention to the differentiation of activists, pay attention to opening up ideas, and pay attention to the unity of our class. The view that leadership is not needed if we let go is wrong.

Distribution of Fruits Has New Significance in Land Reform Movement

III. The distribution of the fruits of the struggle is an extremely important link in the mass emancipation movement and a new issue in land reform. (In rent and interest reduction, a certain mass faces a certain struggle object, and the distribution of fruits is easy to determine, but in land reform, it is basically an equal distribution to eliminate extreme poverty, so the distribution of fruits requires more unified planning, which is more difficult and complex.) If this issue is not handled properly, it will inevitably cause internal disputes among the masses and give landlords and special agents a chance to take advantage of. Many cadres still do not pay enough attention to the issue of fruit distribution, do not know that this is the fundamental interest of the masses, the fundamental requirement for the masses to rise up to struggle, and a very important thing in land reform. We must implement the mass line, lead it, and not just consider it a technical issue. Those who have not yet distributed the fruits must quickly distribute them. Those who have distributed them but the masses have opinions should be discussed and adjusted again. After the fruit distribution is deepened in the movement, we must combine ideological education and conduct a general inspection of the fruit distribution. (In some places, the distribution is seriously unfair and has become a major obstacle to the movement, a check can be carried out first, and then the movement can be continued, but the inspection time should not be too long to prevent the transfer of goals and the relaxation of anti-feudalism.) This general inspection should be carried out through mass opinion brewing and in a harmonious spirit, and discussed to resolve the issue. It is wrong for some places to treat the masses who have gained more fruit in the way of fighting landlords. In the middle of this, we must strictly prevent special agents and landlords from taking the opportunity to provoke and split the masses. In the distribution inspection, we must also focus on checking the landlord's concealment, omission, or escape phenomenon, and thoroughly clear it out to adjust the masses who have not obtained or have obtained less. The middle peasants should be checked to see if there has been any infringement or gain, and they should be absorbed to participate in the distribution and the peasants' association. For the family members of martyrs, military dependents, and honorary soldiers, we should try to get people from the political organs of the troops to participate in order to be appropriate and to educate the troops and the masses, so as to lay a good foundation for joining the army in the future. The care of the landlords should be discussed and reviewed by the masses at this time in order to unite the peasants, stabilize the new class relations, consolidate the victory, and turn to production. After the village problem is resolved and the fruit distribution is completed, a village-wide victory meeting and unity meeting should be held.

Improve Mass Ideological Awareness on the Basis of Mass Practice

IV. In order to unite ourselves, eliminate feudalism, and realize "land to the tiller," we must improve our ideological awareness on the basis of mass practice. This ideological guidance runs through the entire movement process. In the in-depth stage of the movement, a victorious summary movement should be carried out to clearly resolve some basic ideas of the masses and completely break the shackles of superstition, conscience, fate, and the change of heaven. The masses' ideology clearly understands that overthrowing the landlords is a righteous and just action, and establishes the peasants' conscious unity and armed self-defense ideology to protect the fruits. On the basis of the peasant class consciousness, establish the peasant's ideology of production and prosperity, and clarify the direction after emancipation - the Wu Manyou direction. In the ideological movement process, we must further cultivate activists, improve the awareness of backward masses and women, and form a broad mass ideological movement. We should pay attention to consolidating the class consciousness of hired and poor peasants, and educating hired and poor peasants to unite with middle peasants. If the middle peasants are harmed in the movement, they should be practically taken care of, their ideological knots should be untied, and mutual understanding and unity should be sought. For military dependents, family members of martyrs, and honorary servicemen, we should educate the masses to respect them. Not only should they be taken care of in the distribution of fruits, but they should also be helped in production. Otherwise, the ideas of armed self-defense, unity, and production will fall short. The ideological education should make extensive use of various forms centered on people's schools and winter schools, take care of the mass production activities, and must be combined with the emancipation summary (emancipation review) to combine the practical experience of the masses, in order to be an ideological movement of the mass line that comes from the masses and goes to the masses.

Timely Adjustment of Cadre-Mass Relations

V. In the course of the movement, we should pay attention to selecting and training cadres from the broad masses of activists, unite the activists to contact the broad masses, establish a leadership core, and timely adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses, and establish a good style of cadres. Cadres should be educated to listen to the opinions of the masses with humility and sincerity, and to adopt a democratic approach of letting go to inspire the masses to boldly put forward opinions, and then carry out discussions to seek solutions ideologically. In this movement, we cannot take the method of dealing with landlords, but take the method of self-criticism and mutual criticism. Even for cadres with political problems, we should adopt the mass line, persuade them to reflect, confess, change their positions, and cherish the spirit of saving. For some spies, they should be unconditionally cleaned up. Other cadres with bad character who take advantage of opportunities and are opposed by the masses should also be dismissed and re-elected by the masses, because the relationship between the cadres and the masses in the new area is still relatively shallow, and it is good to select outstanding members and put the leadership positions in the hands of true mass leaders and activists in accordance with the opinions of the masses. However, the basic policy on the issue of cadres in the new area is to educate, improve, and consolidate. As long as they are truly connected with the masses, come from the masses, and are willing to serve the masses, even if they have some minor problems or have made temporary mistakes but can quickly correct them, they should adopt the policy of transformation and education. After the masses put forward opinions on the cadres, the leading comrades should help the cadres to make self-criticism, enlighten them to be good at accepting the opinions of the masses and correcting their mistakes. Even the cadres who are removed should be comforted and persuaded to maintain an activist, or to be a hero on the production front, doing good things wholeheartedly, and will be elected in the future. Only in this way can we stabilize other cadres, convince the part of the masses who support them, and make the special agents and landlords unable to take advantage of the opportunity.

Mass Organization Construction

VI. In the mass emancipation movement, especially at the current stage of deepening the movement, we must pay attention to the development and construction of various mass organizations. In the entire process of the movement, the role of the Peasants' Association is extremely great. It has supreme rights and prestige. The entire movement needs such a centralized mass organization (the internal of the Peasants' Association must be democratic) to closely integrate with the political power and armed forces. Only in this way can the revolutionary power of the masses be brought into play. At present, the Peasants' Association must be greatly developed and widely absorb young and women members, and the Peasants' Association cannot only be an activist association. After the peasants are thoroughly emancipated, the task of the Peasants' Association will focus on organizing mass production, and women will establish a pure organization to lead textile production and participate in agricultural production to develop family sideline industries, so as to relieve women of the various pains given by feudal habits.

The construction of militia is one of the basic contents of mass organization construction. Without a large number of militia, the fruits of mass emancipation will be seriously threatened. Therefore, in the process of the movement, especially at the present tense moment of the self-defense war, we must guide the masses to understand the importance of armed forces and consciously participate in the militia to master weapons. At present, the militia in the border areas must pay attention to rectification and control, especially the cadres and those who hold guns must be members who have been tested in the emancipation movement, and the mistake of simply using gun proficiency as the standard must be corrected. When developing the militia, it must be carried out with a universal review after mass identification, approval by the Peasants' Association, and in conjunction with mass education and the mass line method. At the same time, a political and technical rectification and training movement must also be carried out.

As for the transformation and construction of political power, it is realized with the development of the movement. After the counterattack, as soon as the anti-treason liquidation began, the masses took over the political power and helped the peasants to emancipate themselves. However, more systematic construction can only have masses and pillars when there are organizations such as the authoritative Peasants' Association and the armed militia. The political power itself can have prestige and can take on the role of suppressing reactionaries, protecting the masses, and playing a role in construction and organization.

Carry Out Mass Movement in Border Areas

VII. The main task of the border area is to carry out mass guerrilla warfare and persist in the struggle in the border area. Therefore, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses. Several months of experience have proved that in the vast border areas connected to the base areas, influenced by the land reform in the base areas, the masses only demand land. The enemy's situation also changes and there are many opportunities to take advantage of. We should seize the time and space and the larger gaps to boldly mobilize the masses, attack and weaken the social foundation of feudal comprador. This is beneficial to persisting in the border area. In the self-defense war, large landlords, local tyrants, and evil gentry are the enemy's reliable social foundation. If their rule is not defeated, the masses will not be able to gain an advantage, there will be no consistency in the whole village, and a strong struggle against the enemy cannot be carried out. There, because the struggle between the enemy and us is extremely sharp, the masses are seriously threatened by the enemy in their lives and thoughts. Therefore, armed support must be provided from the beginning. In addition to the support of local backbone armed forces, the armed emancipation team is a good experience; it plays the role of an emancipation team and can organize the guerrilla warfare of the masses. In the movement itself, we must combine armed forces with mobilizing the masses and combine emancipation with defending emancipation, so as to effectively break the idea of ​​changing heaven and the movement can continue. Mobilizing the masses in the border area must be accurate, seize the time, and take action on a large scale or in a whole village at the same time, so that the reactionaries do not have time to destroy it, and it is impossible to defeat them one by one. Such actions generally require full preparation, brewing, and collusion, to discover and cultivate courageous activists, and to carry out powerful mobilization work. A strong and powerful guerrilla team and militia armed forces must take the initiative to attack and be prepared. After the action, immediately organize a large number of masses and arm the masses, and rapidly develop guerrilla warfare to defend the gains and expand the movement. In narrow areas or areas where the enemy constantly harasses, cooperate with the activities of the troops, strive for the masses in the guerrilla warfare against grabbing food, grabbing Ding, and defending the vital interests of the masses, gradually cultivate activists, unite advanced masses, and launch a large-scale emancipation movement when conditions are favorable, attack the main rulers, and strengthen guerrilla warfare.

VIII. The old area checks the fields according to the winter work instructions (missing)

Pay Attention to Urban-Rural Unity

IX. Pay attention to adjusting urban-rural relations, seeking mutual unity between urban masses and the vast number of rural peasants, and strive for capitalists to develop industry and commerce. In the past, the city has always been the old nest of the ruling class, and it has always been contradictory to the countryside. "The city eats the countryside, it is reasonable, the countryside eats the city, it is impossible" is a portrayal of the traditional relationship. These cities that we have liberated have undergone basic changes, and the economic center of the city serves the countryside and is basically supported by the vast number of peasants. However, in the mass movement, cities continue to have conflicts with rural areas, and even reflect the conflicts between urban cadres and rural cadres. They do not understand some specific conflicts between urban workers and peasants. Only the great alliance of urban and rural working people can break the tradition of "city eats the countryside." To solve these problems, we should first educate urban cadres, mobilize the urban masses, carry out anti-treason and anti-special activities, increase wages and improve treatment movements, production movements, and promote the movement of native products for economic self-defense, and unite industrial and commercial capitalists. Only in this way can we talk about urban-rural alliance. On the rural cadre side, we should pay attention to uniting the urban masses, forming an urban-rural united mass movement, and carefully taking care of industrial and commercial capitalists in the emancipation of peasants.

　　太行区党委总结新区土地改革
    指示继续深入运动方向
    【本报特讯】去年十二月，太行区党委于总结该区群众翻身运动之后，随即指示各县，深入贯彻群众翻身，达到在春耕前彻底完成土地改革，兹摘录其要意如下：
    太行一年来，新区群众得到了普遍的发动，一半以上的新区，基本上消灭了封建，实现了耕者有其田。将近一半的新区，正在继续开展扫除封建残余的热烈运动。一年经验证明凡是从思想上、实践上解决了大胆放手，群众路线，培养贫雇骨干，团结中农，发动广大农民（包括广大妇女及贫苦军属），坚决消灭封建的地方，运动就猛烈迅速的开展起来，否则运动就受到阻碍，或潜伏着新的困难。为了彻底消灭封建，实行耕者有其田，为了支持爱国自卫战争的胜利，与准备即将到来的大生产运动，我们必须深入贯彻群众翻身运动。封建势力尚未打垮的地区，继续猛烈开展运动，迅速实现耕者有其田。基本消灭封建，实现土地改革的地区，就开展一个群众翻身检查运动。今后一个时期的运动，尤应面向落后群众与落后村，消灭落后，团结广大农民，提高觉悟，最后割掉封建尾巴，实行填平补齐，完成彻底翻身。
    认识地主狡猾阴谋
    进行彻底检查翻身
    一、首先在对待地主的问题上，必须是彻底消灭封建，实现耕者有其田。不要为过去任何传统经验所约束。根据多年减租查减的经验，地主阶级是十分狡猾顽强的，他曾采取各种卑鄙龌龊手段来保存自己经济政治地位，松弛与分裂群众的团结。对于封建地主各种软硬反攻与一切拖延抵抗的办法和企图，必须予以坚决的打击，完全摧垮其统治，不如此，群众就翻不透身。所以新区运动走向深入的时候，必须领导群众进行深入的检查，看地主是否钻了空子？保存或变相保存过多土地？是否有夺回斗争果实的现象？是否政治上还保留着在群众中的欺骗作用和部分群众的同情？是否还私藏枪械或其他有组织的反动行为？……在这些问题彻底解决的基础上，才能谈到对地主的适当照顾，给地主留一定的土地，使他能够生活下去。如果问题解决不彻底，农民在政治上、思想上、经济上翻不透身，照顾会变成保留封建残余。但在群众充分翻身之后，又必须坚决教育群众，给中小地主及各色人等以适当照顾。同时在农民翻身运动中，又必须紧紧团结农民自己。即既发动贫、雇（他们是反封建的先锋和主力），又团结中农（他们占人口百分之三十四以上，反封建与参军生产都离不开他们），一切伤害农民自己（打击中农轻视“落后”农民）的做法，都是错误的。所以，地主是否消灭（经济上）？地主的封建统治是否打垮（政治上）？是翻身检查的第一个标准；而农民（首先是贫雇农）是否发动？农民内部是否和谐团结？是翻身检查的第二个标准；两者缺一都不能达到彻底消灭封建与充分发动群众，完满实现耕者有其田的目的。
    大胆放手的群众路线领导方法
    二、关于大胆放手群众路线的领导方法。一年翻身运动中，特别是实行耕者有其田的运动后，有了极大的发展。其特点是自上而下的撑腰作主，与自下而上的串通酝酿直接行动，以及贯串整个运动过程大量的以贫雇为骨干团结中农的紧密结合，既发挥了党对群众翻身运动的领导作用，又高度发扬了广大群众的革命积极性。这样运动才能猛烈迅速的发展起来，以排山倒海之势，摧毁封建地主政治经济的统治，打破了以为群众路线就非自下而上慢慢来不可的狭隘观点，大胆放手群众路线的领导作风必须掌握三个基本环节：第一、划清阶级界线，明确斗争目标——消灭封建，明确自己阵营——发动广大农民，即是弄清放手给谁，放手斗争谁。第二、不断打通群众思想，启发群众阶级仇恨，使农民认识打倒地主取得土地的正义性，不断提高农民觉悟，使农民认识到保卫果实的正义性，自觉参加武装。使农民认识到大老蒋小老蒋的联系，自觉的参军参战，打垮大老蒋的进攻。同时启发其阶级感情与阶级团结精神，懂得“天下农民是一家”的真理。第三、培养训练积极分子，特别是贫雇积极分子，使整个运动具有坚强的群众性的骨干。以上三者以培养训练广大群众性的积极分子是最基本的。但在领导上不能只注意积极分子的反映与情绪，必须同时注意积极分子以外的（中间的落后的）广大群众的反映与情绪。特别在运动深入的时候，尤应注意此点。必须教育积极分子，注意广大群众的反映与要求，注意新的积极分子的生长与培养。同时不同的运动、不同的运动阶段，有不同的内容，斗争的阵营、重点、思想问题也就不同，所以在运动转折时，领导上要特别注意积极分子的分化，注意打通思想，注意本阶级的团结，认为放手就不需要领导的观点是错误的。
    土地改革运动中分果实有新意义
    三、斗争果实的分配，是群众翻身运动中一个极其重要的环节，是土地改革中的新问题，（减租减息中，是一定群众对一定的斗争对象，果实分配是容易确定的，而在土地改革中，基本上是平均分配消灭赤贫，因之果实的分配就更加需要统一计划，也就更加困难和复杂了）这一问题处理不好，势必引起群众内部纠纷，予地主特务以可乘之隙。许多干部直到现在，对分配果实问题还重视不够，不知道这是群众根本利益所在，是群众所以起来斗争的根本要求，是土地改革中一件极关重要的事情，必须贯彻群众路线，加以领导，而不能仅仅认为是技术问题。凡尚未分配果实者，即须迅速分配，分配而群众有意见者，则应重新讨论加以调剂。在运动深入果实分配之后，必须结合思想教育，进行果实分配的总检查。（某些地方分配严重不公，且已成为运动的重大障碍时，则可先进行一次检查，然后继续开展运动，但检查时间不宜过长，防止转移目标，放松反封建。）这一总检查要经过群众舆论酝酿，以和谐的精神，讨论的方式来解决。有的地方采取斗争地主的方式对待多得果实的群众是错误的。这中间并要严防特务地主乘机挑拨，分裂群众，在分配检查中，要同时着重检查地主隐瞒遗漏或逃避现象，彻底清出，用以调剂未得或少得的群众。对中农应检查是否有所侵犯，是否有所获得，并吸收他们参加分配，参加农会。对烈属军属尽可能争取部队政治机关派人参加，以求适当并教育部队群众，为今后参军打下好基础。对地主的照顾，此时应经由群众讨论审查，以便团结农民，稳定新的阶级关系，巩固胜利，转向生产，在全村问题解决，果实分配结束之后，应开一次全村胜利大会，团结大会。
    在群众实践基础上
    提高群众思想觉悟
    四、为了团结自己，消灭封建，实现耕者有其田，必须在群众实践的基础上，提高其思想觉悟。这一思想指导，是贯串着整个运动过程的。在运动深入阶段，应当进行胜利的总结运动，以明确解决群众一些基本思想，彻底打破迷信、良心、命运及变天等束缚。群众的思想明确打倒地主是天经地义的正义行动，树立农民自觉的团结思想与保卫果实的武装自卫思想。在农民阶级觉悟的基础上，树立农民生产发家的思想，明确翻身以后的方向——吴满有方向。在思想运动过程中，要进一步培养积极分子，提高落后群众及妇女觉悟，形成广大的群众思想运动。要注意巩固雇贫农阶级觉悟，教育雇、贫农团结中农，如果在运动中伤害了中农，就应从实际上加以照顾，思想上解开圪塔，求得互相谅解，互相团结。对军属、烈属、荣誉军人应教育群众尊重他们，不但在分果实上应照顾他们，在生产上也应帮助他们，不然武装自卫的思想、团结的思想、生产的思想都会落空。思想教育的进行，应广泛利用以民校冬校为中心的各种形式，照顾群众生产活动，并必须与翻身总结（翻身回顾）结合进行，才能结合群众的实践经验，才能是从群众中来，到群众中去的群众路线的思想运动。
    及时调整干部群众关系
    五、在运动过程中，应注意从广大积极分子中挑选与培养干部，团结积极分子联系广大群众，建立领导核心，并及时调整干部与群众关系，树立干部的优良作风。应该教育干部虚心的诚恳的听取群众的意见，要采取放手民主的方针，启发群众大胆提出意见，然后开展讨论，从思想上求得解决。在这一运动中，不能采取对地主的办法，而是采取自我批评与互相批评的方式。即使有政治问题的干部，也应采取群众路线，劝导其反省坦白改变其立场的挽救爱护精神。对一些奸细分子，就应无条件的清洗。其他品质恶劣投机取巧为群众所反对的干部，也应经过群众罢免改选，因为新区干部与群众的关系还比较浅，大胆按照群众意见，才好选拔优秀分子，把领导岗位掌握在真正的群众领袖与积极分子手里。但对新区干部问题，基本是教育提高与巩固方针，只要真正与群众有联系，从群众中来愿为群众服务，即使有些小毛病，或犯过一时错误尚能迅速改正的人，却应采取改造教育方针。群众对干部提出意见之后，领导同志要帮助干部作自我批评，启发其善于接受群众意见改正错误，即使被撤换的干部，也要安慰他，说服他保持一个积极分子，或做一个生产战线上的英雄，忠心做好事，将来还会被选的。这样才能安定其他干部，使拥护他们的部分群众心服，使特务地主无隙可乘。
    群众组织建设
    六、在群众翻身运动中，尤其在目前深入运动的时候，必须注意各种群众组织的发展与建设。在运动整个过程中，农会的作用是极大的，它具有无上的权利和威信，整个运动需要这样一个群众的集中组织（农会内部必须民主）以与政权武装密切结合，这样才能发挥群众排山倒海的革命威力。目前农会必须大量发展并广泛吸收青年与妇女会员，不能使农会只能是一个积极分子会，农民彻底翻身后，农会任务将着重组织群众生产，妇女则建立单纯的组织以领导纺织，并参加农业生产发展家庭副业，以解除封建习惯给予妇女的各种痛苦。
    民兵建设是群众组织建设的基本内容之一。没有大量的民兵，群众翻身果实会受到严重的威胁，因此在运动过程中，特别在自卫战争紧张的目前，必须引导群众了解武装之重要，自觉参加民兵掌握武器。边地民兵目前必须注意整顿与掌握，尤其是干部和拿枪的必须是在翻身运动中经过考验的分子，必须纠正单纯以会打枪为标准的错误。发展民兵时，要经过群众鉴定，农会批准并结合群众教育，群众路线方法进行一番普遍的审查，同时还要开展政治上技术上的整训运动。
    至于政权的改造与建设，是随着运动的发展来实现的。反攻以后反奸清算一开始，群众就把政权拿过来了，并帮助农民翻身，但比较系统的建设只有当着有了权威的农会，武装的民兵等组织时，它才能有群众有支柱。政权本身才能有威信，才能负起镇压反动派保护群众，起建设与组织的作用。
    开展边地群众运动
    七、边地任务，主要要求开展群众游击战争，坚持边地斗争，因此也必须发动群众。几个月经验证明：凡连系根据地的广大边地，受根据地土地改革影响，群众只要求土地。而敌情变化也多有隙可乘，应抓紧时间空间及较大空隙放手发动群众，打击与削弱封建买办的社会基础，这对坚持边地是有利的。在自卫战争中大地主豪绅恶霸是敌人可靠的社会基础，不打垮他们的统治，群众就取不到优势，就不能有全村的一致，就不能开展坚强的对敌斗争。在那里由于敌我斗争异常尖锐，群众在生活上思想上都受着敌人严重的威胁，因此一开始就必须有武装的支援，除地方基干武装必须支援外，武装翻身队是一个很好的经验；它起翻身队作用，又能组织群众的游击战争。在运动本身必须把武装与发动群众相结合，把翻身和保卫翻身相结合，这样才能有效的打破变天思想，运动才能继续下去。边地发动群众要看准时机，争取时间，大规模的或一片村庄一齐动作，迅速突然使反动派来不及破坏，也不可能各个击破。这样的行动，一般要经过充分准备、酝酿、串通，要发现与培养胆大的积极分子，进行有力的鼓动工作，要有强而有力的游击队与民兵武装主动出击、戒备。行动起来之后，马上大量组织群众和武装群众，迅速发展游击战争，保卫已得利益与运动的扩大。在狭窄地带或敌人不断进扰的地区，则配合部队活动，在反抢粮、反抓丁、保卫群众切身利益的游击战争中争取群众，逐渐培养积极分子，团结先进群众，于条件有利时发动大规模的翻身运动，打击主要的统治者，加强游击战争。
    八、老区查田依冬季工作指示方针进行（缺）
    注意城乡团结
    九、注意城乡关系的调整，求得城市群众与乡村广大农民相互团结，争取资本家发展工商业。过去城市从来是统治阶级的老巢，它和乡村历来是矛盾的，“城吃乡，理应当，乡吃城，万不能”。是传统关系的写照。我们解放了的这些城市，已起了基本变化，城市为乡村服务，而又基本上为广大农民所支持的经济重心。但在群众运动中，城市不断与农村发生矛盾，甚至反映为城市干部与农村干部矛盾，城市工人与农民的某些具体的矛盾他们不大了解，只有城乡劳动人民大联合，才能打破“城吃乡”的传统。解决这些问题，首先应教育城市干部，把城市群众发动起来，开展除奸反特及增资改善待遇运动、生产运动以及提倡土货经济自卫运动，团结工商业资本家。只有这样才能谈到城乡联合。在农村干部方面，应注意团结城市群众，形成城乡联合的群众运动，并在农民翻身中，细心的照顾工商业资本家。
