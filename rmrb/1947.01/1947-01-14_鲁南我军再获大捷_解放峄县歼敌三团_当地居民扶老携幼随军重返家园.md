　　Another Great Victory for Our Army in Southern Shandong
　　Yixian Liberated, Three Enemy Regiments Annihilated
　　Local Residents, Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young, Follow the Army to Return to Their Homes.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shandong Front, Urgent Telegram, 12th] Yixian City, an important town on the Tai'erzhuang-Zaozhuang line, which was occupied by Chiang's army on October 8th last year, was liberated again yesterday morning, and all three regiments of the Chiang's army defending the city were annihilated. According to the No. 5 Communiqué issued by the Front Command of the East China Field Army of the New Fourth Army: In the midst of heavy snow, our Field Army counterattacked Yixian City and, after five hours of fierce fighting, recovered the city at 7:00 AM on the 11th. The majority of the 114th Brigade of the 51st Division of Chiang's army, and the 98th Regiment of the 33rd Brigade of the 52nd Division, a total of three regiments, were completely annihilated. The results of the battle are currently being tallied.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shandong Front, 12th] After the vast area east of Yixian was recovered, residents who had taken refuge elsewhere are now supporting the old and carrying the young, following the New Fourth Army to return home. This reporter, accompanying the army, passed through places like Shapu and Xinzhuang, and saw villagers returning to joyfully tidy up their homes. Some residents and militiamen were excitedly discussing the embarrassing situation of the Chiang's army's retreat, and they complained to reporters about the brutality of Chiang's army during their occupation of the area, and their heroic deeds in persisting in guerrilla warfare nearby. When the troops entered Xiaoluwei, the masses of the entire village rushed out to greet them. A frail old man hurriedly told the location of Chiang's army's escape and guided the troops to pursue them. Guanzhuang, formerly a strongly fortified stronghold of the 169th Brigade of Chiang's army, has now gradually returned to peaceful order.

　　鲁南我军再获大捷
    解放峄县歼敌三团
  　当地居民扶老携幼随军重返家园
    【新华社鲁南前线十二日急电】去年十月八日被蒋军侵占之台（儿庄）枣（庄）支线上重镇峄县城，已于昨晨重获解放，守城蒋军三个团全部被歼。据新四军华东野战军前线指挥部发布第五号公报称：在大雪纷飞中，我野战军反击峄县城，经五小时激战，于十一日晨七时，收复该城。守城蒋军五十一师一一四旅大部，及五十二师三三旅之九十八团，共计三个团全部就歼，战果正清查中。
    【新华社鲁南前线十二日电】峄县以东广大地区光复后，避难在外之居民正扶老携幼，尾随新四军返家。记者随军行经沙圃、新庄等处，见乡民均已归来欢欣收拾家务，有些居民和民兵们则兴奋的谈论着蒋军败退的狼狈情形，并纷纷向记者控诉蒋军占领该地时之残暴行为，及渠等在附近坚持游击战争的英雄事迹。当部队进自小鲁圩时，全村群众争先在外迎候，一瘦弱老者急忙告知蒋军逃逸地点引导队伍去追击。原为蒋军一六九旅强固据点的官庄，现已逐渐恢复和平秩序。
