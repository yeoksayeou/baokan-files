　　Jinnan Troops
    Launch Merit Campaign
    36th Unit Specifies Merit Conditions
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 18th dispatch] The merit campaign has now penetrated into the Jinnan troops. A certain unit, on its way to the front line for combat, held a meeting of political instructors and above, deciding that companies should set up merit committees and platoons should set up merit groups. After each battle, meetings would be held to evaluate merits and rewards would be announced promptly. Any merit in any aspect, after being recognized by everyone, can be recorded in the merit book, and registration can be divided into units and individuals. The Eighth Detachment of the 36th Unit specifically discussed and formulated merit conditions, divided into wartime and training. Wartime: (1) Obey orders and complete tasks assigned by superiors; (2) Seize more weapons and capture more prisoners; (3) Charge ahead and retreat last, be able to do mobilization work, and consolidate combat morale; (4) Implement the Party's policies, abide by battlefield discipline, keep time and discipline when marching, do not fall behind, help the sick carry things, be able to do marching mobilization and explanation work, carry out propaganda work at any time, and have good mass discipline. Training: (1) Study hard and be able to help others; (2) Be able to endure hardship and be proactive; (3) Have good military discipline and etiquette, cherish public property, and pay attention to hygiene; (4) Be a model in implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Now the detachment has established a merit committee, and each squad has a member to investigate, understand, and reflect the merits of each comrade, report to the committee once every ten days, and make a summary every half month to announce to everyone. "Striving to get on the merit book" has now become the goal of every officer and soldier in the unit.

　　冀南各部队
    开展立功运动
    三六部队具体订定立功条件
    【本报威县十八日电】立功运动现已深入冀南各部队。某部在开赴前线作战途中，召开政指以上政治工作人员会议，决定中队设置立功委员会，分队设立功小组，每一战役结束后开会评功，及时公布奖励。任何一方面有功绩，经过大家公认，都可以记入功劳簿，登记时可分单位和个人。三六部队八分队便具体讨论，制订了立功条件，分战时、整训两种。战时：（一）服从命令，完成上级给的任务；（二）缴武器捕捉俘虏多；（三）冲锋在前，退却在后，会作鼓动工作，巩固战斗情绪；（四）执行党的政策，遵守战场纪律，行军时守时间、守纪律、不掉队、帮助病号背东西、会作行军鼓动解释工作、随时进行宣传工作、群众纪律好。整训时：（一）努力学习，并能帮助别人；（二）能吃苦耐劳，奋发积极；（三）军风纪礼节周到，爱护公物，讲卫生；（四）执行三大纪律八项注意的模范。现在分队已建立了立功委员会，每班都有一个组员，调查了解反映每个同志的功绩，十天向委员会汇报一次，半月作一总结，向大家公布。“为了争取登上功劳簿而努力”。现已成为该部每个指战员的奋斗目标。
