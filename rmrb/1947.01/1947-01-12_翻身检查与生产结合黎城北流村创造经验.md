　　Overturning Grievances, Combining Inspection with Production: Beiliu Village, Licheng Creates Experience
　　[This Dispatch from Changzhi, 10th] Beiliu Village in Licheng has created an experience of combining overturning grievances, inspection with production. 1. Carry out education on overturning grievances and production in winter schools. At the beginning of the movement, the situation of the village was first discussed in the winter school in a symposium manner to clarify the masses' thinking that this winter is mainly for winter production, and to carry out overturning grievances and inspection in production to overcome the masses' thinking of waiting for investigation and reduction and not engaging in production. At the same time, it was also clearly pointed out that this year is the last time for investigation and reduction, and the masses must thoroughly overturn grievances. 2. Cadres uniformly lead and divide responsibilities. In order to do a good job in both overturning grievances and production, all the village cadres formed a work team to uniformly lead overturning grievances and production. All the cadres of the village's 21 large and small cooperatives, textile teams, mutual aid teams, textile factories, workshops, a coal factory, and three small winter schools collectively studied, uniformly led, and were responsible for going deep into the various production departments to extensively enlighten the masses. 3. Organize the masses to overturn grievances in production organizations. Men are organized according to production mutual aid teams, women are organized according to textile teams, and workshops and cooperatives are also brewing and enlightening at the same time according to production units. In a short period of time, more than 450 people (accounting for 92% of the village's population) voluntarily combined to form eight overturning grievance teams, and also mobilized many old men and women who had not participated in mutual aid groups and were most oppressed. After the masses rose up, a people-elected overturning grievance committee was formed to uniformly lead the overturning of grievances. 4. Time division and production arrangements. During the day, brewing is carried out in production, and at night, meetings are held in winter schools to solve problems. On transportation, organized methods are adopted, with one person driving two animals, and those at home participating in overturning grievances. During transportation, activists lead the way, playing a role in enlightening and guiding, visiting the miserable and discussing problems while walking. The leadership arranges time in a planned way, seizing the time to hold meetings and centrally solve problems when transporting animals are resting. This can not only mobilize the broad masses and quickly solve problems, but also does not hinder production.

　　翻身检查与生产结合黎城北流村创造经验
    【本报长治十日电】黎城北流村创造了翻身检查与生产结合的经验。一、在冬学里进行翻身生产教育。运动开始，首先在冬学里用座谈方式讨论本村的情况，使群众思想上明确今冬主要是搞冬季生产，并要在生产中进行翻身检查，克服群众等待查减，不搞生产的思想，同时更明确的提出：今年是最后一次查减，必须把群众翻身闹彻底。二、干部统一领导分工负责。为了把翻身生产都搞好，全村干部组成工作小组，统一领导翻身生产，全村二十一个大小合作社，纺织队、互助队、纺织厂、作坊、一座煤厂，三个小型冬学的所有干部，集体研究，统一领导、分别负责深入到各生产部门广泛的启发群众。三、在生产组织里组织群众翻身。男人按生产互助队、女人按纺织队，各作坊、合作社亦按生产单位同时进行酝酿启发，在短时期内即有四百五十余人（占全村群众百分之九十二），自愿结合起来，组成八个翻身队，把许多没有参加互助组而受压迫最大的老汉老婆也发动起来，群众起来之后，民选翻身委员会，统一领导翻身。四、时间划分和生产按排。白天在生产中进行酝酿，黑夜在冬学里开会解决问题。在运输上采取组织起来的办法，一人赶两头牲口，誊人在家参加翻身，运输在路上让积极分子带领，起启发引导作用，边走边访苦、谈问题。领导上有计划的按排时间，在运输牲口休息的时候，即抓紧召开会议，集中解决问题，这样不但可以发动广大群众，迅速解决问题，而且不妨碍生产。
