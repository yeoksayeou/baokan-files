    A Guerrilla Force Composed of City People
    Li Jun
    Since the puppet Wu Huawen's troops invaded Jining on September 15th, the nearly 100,000 liberated citizens of Jining have had their livelihoods snatched away by the Chiang bandits. Unwilling to be oppressed by the Chiang army, they organized a guerrilla force on the third day after withdrawing from Jining. The participants included rickshaw pullers, bathhouse workers, small vendors, shop assistants, and students. At the founding meeting, they all said with resentment: "Our past struggle against the bad elements and secret agents was only the beginning of liberation. To achieve complete liberation, we must eliminate the armed enemy." They unanimously swore: "We will not give up until we defeat the reactionaries."

    For three months, this guerrilla force has never left the vicinity of Jining. Every time the enemy came out to seize grain and conscript men, they were attacked by them. In total, there have been twelve major and minor battles with the enemy in the past three months, striking at Chiang's special agents, the "Homecoming Corps," and the puppet bandit Wu Huawen's troops everywhere in Chengguan, west of the city, northwest of the city, east of the city, and north of the city. They even raided Jining Chengguan twice. In one battle to defend their position, the enemy's artillery and machine guns bombarded them for two whole days, but the guerrillas never left their position, and as a result, they finally repelled the enemy. In Zhangshan, they used a platoon of soldiers to defeat two companies of the enemy's grain-grabbing troops, inflicting more than ten casualties on the enemy while suffering none themselves. Recently, they also cooperated with a certain unit to go deep into the enemy's rear in southern Jining and Jiaxiang to carry out activities. In six days, they cleared the Chiang-puppet regime in southern Jining and Jiaxiang, eliminating five township governments and one district headquarters, and cooperated with a certain unit to seize fifteen vehicles on the Jin (Xiang) Ji (Ning) highway. On December 26th, more than ten miles northwest of Jiaxiang city, they persisted in fighting against more than 800 enemies invading from Jiaxiang for a whole day, and finally defeated the enemy.

    This team has grown stronger in battle, and the soldiers have made rapid progress in their combat life. They used to be accustomed to urban life, but now they are used to guerrilla life. They could not walk long distances in the past, but now they can walk a hundred miles a day. Their spirit of enduring hardship is even more admirable. Everyone recognizes that this suffering was given by Chiang Kai-shek, and they are determined to drive the invading Chiang army out of Jining and out of the liberated areas. In independent activities, many lightly ill patients fought like everyone else. Now they are launching a campaign to establish merit, and everyone is striving to be a combat hero.

    一支城市人民组成的游击队
    李君
    自九月十五日伪吴化文部侵占济宁后，济宁市近十万的翻身市民饭碗又被蒋贼夺去了，他们不愿受蒋军压迫，就在退出济宁后的第三天组织起一支游击队，参加的有人力车夫、有澡塘工人、有小商贩和店员、还有学生，他们在成立大会上一致愤恨的说：“我们过去与坏蛋特务作斗争，那只是翻身的开始，要想彻底翻身，还必须消灭武装敌人。”他们一致宣誓：“不打垮反动派誓不罢休。”
    三个月来，这支游击队从未离开过济宁周围，敌人每次出来抢粮抓丁，都遭到他们的打击。总计三个月来与敌人大小战斗十二次，在城关、在城西、城西北、城东、城北，到处打击蒋特“还乡团”和伪匪吴化文的部队，曾两度袭入济宁城关。在一次坚守阵地的战斗中，敌人的大炮机枪轰击了整整两天，但游击队员们始终没有离开阵地一步，结果终于把敌人打退了。在张山，他们以一个排的兵力打垮了敌人抢粮部队两个连，敌人伤亡十余名，而他们无一伤亡。最近他们又配合某部深入济宁、嘉祥南部敌后去活动，六天的工夫扫清了济宁、嘉祥南部的蒋伪政权，消灭了五个乡公所和一个区部，并配合某部在金（乡）济（宁）公路上缴获了十五辆汽车。十二月二十六日，在嘉祥城西北十余里，与嘉祥出犯之敌八百余坚持了一天战斗，终将敌人击溃。
    这支队伍在战斗中壮大了，战士们在战斗生活中有了飞速的进步，他们过去过惯了城市生活，现在也已过惯了游击生活，过去不能走长路，现在一天也能走百十里，吃苦的精神更是值得钦佩，他们每个人都认识这种苦是蒋介石给的，他们决心要把进犯蒋军赶出济宁，赶出解放区。在单独活动中，有很多轻病号都和大家一样作战，现在他们正展开立功运动，每人都争着要做战斗英雄。
