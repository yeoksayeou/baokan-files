When discussing international issues, Hoxha detailed the attitude of the British and American governments towards Albania. He said: "The US government's policy towards Albania is often an endless stream of diplomatic notes, filled with intimidation and threats, which is an unfriendly and unjust policy. The British government's policy is particularly insulting and unfriendly. British ships have violated Albanian sovereignty three times in a row, and they deliberately create incidents to blame Albania." When discussing the Security Council's decision to send a committee to investigate the situation in northern and border areas of Greece, Hoxha declared: "The Albanian government is satisfied with the Security Council's dispatch of a committee to northern Greece, because this is a decision made by the highest international organization that the Albanian people respect the most. If the committee visits Albania, we will provide them with all the assistance they need."
