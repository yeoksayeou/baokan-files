　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Recently, the Kuomintang authorities fabricated rumors that our troops were concentrating forces to attack Yulin, which was actually a cover for the Kuomintang army's large-scale offensive against our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. On the southern front, Chiang and Hu's troops, with the strength of four brigades, launched a large-scale joint attack on Malan City, the seat of our Guanzhong Special Prefecture, from the northwest, southwest, and northeast of Guanzhong starting at 8:00 AM yesterday. On the northwest front, the 192nd Regiment of the 84th Brigade departed from Shanhe Town, Zhengning. On the southwest front, the 369th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade departed from Zhitian Town, Gouyi. On the northeast front, the 367th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade departed from Jiaoping, Yijun. They have now invaded 40 to 50 li into our border region and occupied Chang She Tou, Yao Tou, about 60 li northwest of Malan, and Yang Jia Dian Zi, about 60 li northeast of Malan. Our troops are resisting heroically, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

　　陕甘宁南线战事再起
    蒋胡军三路会犯关中
    我军英勇抵抗现正展开激战
    【新华社延安三十一日电】近日国民党当局凭空造谣说我军正集结兵力进攻榆林，实际上是国民党军对我陕甘宁边区大举进攻的掩护。南线蒋胡军以四个旅兵力，于昨晨八时起，自关中西北、西南、东北三方面大举合击我关中专署所在地之马栏市。西北方面，八十四旅一九二团自正宁山河镇出发。西南方面，一二三旅三六九团由枸邑职田镇出发。东北方面，一二三旅三六七团从宜君焦平出发，现正侵入我边境四五十里，占我马栏西北约六十里之长舌头、摇头及马栏东北约六十里之杨家店子等地。我军英勇抵抗，现正激战中。
