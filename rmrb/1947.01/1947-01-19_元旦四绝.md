　　Four Quatrains on New Year's Day
    Huang Yanpei
    Last year in January, the civil war eased,
    This year, the flames of war rage north, west, and east.
    The heavens show no white snowflakes,
    Only blood blossoms blooming red on the ground.
    Last year in January, the Political Consultative Conference opened,
    This year, the resolutions are burned to ashes.
    May I ask General Marshall,
    "General, what exactly did you come for?"
    Last year, I spent the New Year in the wartime capital,
    This year, I pay respects to the ancestors in the capital.
    The ancestors underground can only weep bitterly,
    Weeping for democracy and weeping for the people's livelihood.
    Last year, after the war, we cried out in distress,
    This year, the public opinion has changed to a different tune:
    "Unable to live in peace, unable to eat our fill,
    Death is better than living."

　　元旦四绝
    黄炎培
    去年一月内战松，
    今年战火北西东。
    天干不见雪花白，
    但见血花满地红。
    去年一月政协开，
    今年决议烧了灰。
    借问将军马歇尔，
    “将军究为何事来”？
    去年陪都度新正，
    今年首都谒先灵。
    先灵地下惟痛哭，
    哭了民权哭民生。
    去年战后呼苦恼，
    今年舆论换一套：
    “居不得安食不饱，
    死去还比活着好”。
