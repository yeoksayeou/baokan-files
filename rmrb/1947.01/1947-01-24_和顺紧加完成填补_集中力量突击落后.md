　　【News from Changzhi of this newspaper】Since the beginning of winter, Heshun has universally launched a movement to fill in the gaps and make up for deficiencies. As of the end of December last year, 143 of the county's 197 administrative villages had completed the task. Through the thorough liquidation of 225 landlords and the land contributions of some feudal rich peasants, the peasants recovered more than 19,000 mu of land, more than 5,500 rooms, more than 600 head of livestock, more than 3,200 dan of grain, more than 9,900 silver yuan, more than 1,554,000 Jichaobiao notes, and a large amount of clothing. The 4,530 households that had not turned over or had only partially turned over in the past movements (including 650 extremely poor households) have now all been filled in and made up for, with an average of more than four mu of land per person. These villages that have completed the land reform are now universally carrying out systematic ideological education. The movement is also underway in the other 54 backward villages (mostly mountain villages and shacks). County and district leaders have invested their main efforts in these villages, in the hope of rapidly completing land reform throughout the county.
