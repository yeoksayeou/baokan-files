Unsurpassed Love
    An Interlude in the Battle of Shao Erzhai
    Wang Ruo
    We were fully three miles away from Chezhuang, right in the crossfire of the enemy at both Da Shao Erzhai and Xiao Shao Erzhai. Our × unit's combatants were hunkered down in trenches, taking fire from both sides. Since morning, the enemy had rained down countless shells and bullets on us.

    Shi Deming and Chen Fuxi were digging together when a hand grenade landed right between them. Chen Fuxi suffered severe head and chest wounds, and Shi Deming was grazed on the back, but he only said:

    “It’s nothing!” “It’s nothing!”

    The medic arrived, and Shi Deming told him to treat Chen Fuxi first. After the bleeding was stopped and the bandages applied, he saw that Chen Fuxi was badly wounded and thought: What if another shell lands here? So, despite the pain in his back, he moved Chen Fuxi to a foxhole that was deeper than his own.

    ×          ×  ×  ×  ×

    Chen Fuxi was in too much pain to bear, and in his dazed state, he saw Shi Deming watching over him, so he waved him closer.

    “Hey! Shi Deming… I’m done for… bury me…”

    “Fuxi! Keep calm, your injury isn't serious! The enemy isn’t far, don't shout. We can't send you during the day because of the open ground, but as soon as it gets dark, you'll be sent to the hospital. Get some rest!”

    Chen Fuxi stopped talking. Shi Deming turned and quietly poked his head out of the foxhole, carefully observing the enemy.

    ×          ×            ×

    The enemy at Shao Erzhai was preparing to break out. The cars had all driven to the west end, and the buzzing of the engines could be clearly heard.

    Chen Fuxi called to Shi Deming again: “Are the enemy tanks charging up?”

    “It’s not tanks, it’s the sound of the cars in the village… What are you afraid of? We have so many troops, the enemy definitely won’t get out. Don’t worry. Even if something happens, as long as I, Shi Deming, am here, I guarantee I won't lose you.”

    Chen Fuxi nodded, seemingly satisfied and grateful. He believed Shi Deming's words, especially "as long as I am here, I guarantee I won't lose you," which gave Chen Fuxi great comfort, and his restless heart slowly regained its calm.

    ×            ×          ×

    Wounded people always feel especially thirsty, especially after running sixty or seventy *li* since entering that night. Then from before dawn until now, for a whole night and a day, no one had eaten a bite of food or drunk a drop of water.

    How wonderful it would be to have a bowl of warm, thick rice gruel at this time! So Chen Fuxi moved his dry lips and asked Shi Deming for a bowl of rice gruel.

    Where could one find rice gruel on the battlefield? Shi Deming guessed that Chen Fuxi was hungry, so he quickly untied his own ration bag. But as soon as he poured the dry rations into his palm, he encountered a new difficulty: “How could he feed him dry, crumbly rations?” That would be hard to swallow. They needed to be soaked to soften them, but where could he find a drop of water in the trenches?

    Shi Deming had gone back and forth twice to retrieve bullets that morning, and had been grazed on the back, and his throat was already hoarse with thirst. Even a mouthful of saliva was extremely precious at this time. But he did not want to disappoint his comrade, so he forced the dry, crumbly rations into his mouth and勉强(mianqiang:勉强,hard pressed; strained; reluctant; unwilling; forced) sucked out a few mouthfuls of saliva, chewing the rations into a fine paste.

    Chen Fuxi was in a daze when he suddenly felt a little warmth being fed into his mouth, which was both fragrant and sweet. He thought the rice gruel had arrived, so he opened his eyes and saw that Shi Deming was feeding him the chewed-up rations mouth to mouth. An indescribable feeling, like an electric current, surged through his body. Chen Fuxi's eyes welled up, and after a long while, he finally said:

    “Don’t worry about me, go and fight!”

　　无比的爱
    邵耳砦战斗插话
    王若
    这儿距车庄足有三里远，正处在大邵耳砦和小邵耳砦两面敌人火力交射之下，我们×部的战斗员们蹲的战壕，遭到了两面夹射，从早晨起，敌人向这边不知打了多少炮弹和枪弹。
    史德明和陈福喜正在一起挖土，一颗手溜弹正巧打在他们中间了，陈福喜头部和胸口负了重伤，史德明的背上也挂了彩，可是他只说：
    “不怎！”“不怎！”
    卫生员来了，史德明先叫救护陈福喜。待止住血，上好绷带，他见陈福喜伤重，想道：如果这儿再落一个炮弹怎么办？所以他也不顾背上的伤疼，把陈福喜移到比他占的工事较深的一个工事里。
    ×          ×  ×  ×  ×
    陈福喜疼的吃不住，昏昏迷迷的见到史德明守在身旁，就摆一摆手，叫他再靠近一些。
    “嗳！史德明…我是不行了…你把我埋了吧……”
    “福喜！沉着气，你的彩不要紧！敌人离得不远，不要叫喊，现在白天开阔地不能送，到天一黑就会把你送到医院里去的，你休息一下吧！”
    陈福喜不吭了，史德明转过身，悄悄的从工事里探出头来，小心的观察敌人。
    ×          ×            ×
    邵耳砦的敌人准备突围，汽车都开到西头来，嗡嗡的马达声，已可清楚的听到。
    陈福喜又在叫史德明：“是不是敌人的坦克冲上来了？”
    “不是坦克，这是村里的汽车响……怕啥，咱们队伍这样多，敌人一定出不来的，你放心吧。纵然有什么，有我史德明在，保证丢不了你”。
    陈福喜点点头，似乎满意而且感激，很相信史德明的话，尤其是“只要我在，保证丢不了你”，更使陈福喜得到很大的安慰，不安的心，又慢慢的恢复平静。
    ×            ×          ×
    受伤的人，都会感到格外的口渴，何况自那晚开进以来，跑了六七十里，又从天不明打到现在，整整的一夜一天，谁都没有吃到一口饭，喝到一口水。
    如果这时有一碗暖暖的稠米汤喝是多么幸福啊！于是陈福喜嚅动了干燥的嘴唇，向史德明要碗米汤喝。
    战场上那里有米汤呢？史德明揣摸到陈福喜是肚饥了，就很快的解下自己的干粮袋。当把干粮刚倒在手心上，他又遇到新的困难：“就把干崩崩的干粮喂他吗？”这是难以咽下去的。需要泡软才好，可是战壕里那里能找到一口水呢？
    史德明在上午曾来回取了两次子弹，背上又挂了彩，嗓子也早已渴哑了。这时连一口唾沫也是非常宝贵的。但他不愿使自己的战友失望，就硬把干崩崩的干粮，塞进嘴里，勉强的吮出几口吐沫，把干粮细细的嚼成烂浆。
    陈福喜正在昏迷中，突然觉到一点温暖，送进嘴里，又香又甜，以为是米汤来了，睁眼一看，原来是史德明正把嚼烂的干粮嘴对嘴的喂他。有一种不可言喻的感情，像电流一样的涌遍他的周身，陈福喜眼圈红润了，半天才说出一句话来：
    “你不用管我，你去打仗吧！”
