Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. According to Agence France-Presse and Reuters Nanjing dispatches on the 27th of last month: Chiang Kai-shek's Chief of Staff Chen Cheng declared at a reception for "National Assembly" representatives on the 26th: "The Communist Army will be defeated within a year." Chen Cheng said: "Before the next National Assembly convenes in December next year, the National Army will wipe out the Communist Army." He also stated: "The Northeast will not allow the Communist Army to rule, and the National Army must occupy the entire Northeast." Chiang Kai-shek reiterated his old tune of "political solution" in his New Year's Day broadcast, which is obviously contradictory and intended to deceive the people.

    伪国大开会时
    陈诚狂吠扩大内战
    【新华社延安四日电】据上月二十七日法国新闻社、路透社南京消息：蒋介石的参谋总长陈诚在二十六日“国大”代表招待会上宣称：“一年内击溃共军”。陈诚说：“下届国民大会明年十二月开会前，国军将肃清共军。”并称：“东北不容共军统治，国军必须占领东北全部”。而蒋介石元旦广播中又重弹其“政治解决”的老调，显然是自相矛盾企图欺骗人民而已。
