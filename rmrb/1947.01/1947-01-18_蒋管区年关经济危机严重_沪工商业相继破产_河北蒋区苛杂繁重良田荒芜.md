Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. The economic crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas is worsening as the end of the year approaches. According to Reuters and a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 14th, in the past few days in Shanghai, the economic center of the Chiang-controlled areas, 89 stores and 59 commercial companies have registered bankruptcy with the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau. In addition, six woolen mills and ten other factories have ceased operations. During the same period, according to the Central News Agency's own estimates, another twenty or so stores closed down on their own without notifying the Social Affairs Bureau. It is expected that more factories and stores will close during the Lunar New Year period. In South China, according to a Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou on the 15th, amidst extreme economic exhaustion, merchants in all trades are suffering losses in their year-end settlements. Only consumer businesses such as dance halls, jewelry stores, and teahouses are thriving, with new establishments springing up like mushrooms. This abnormal prosperity stands in stark contrast to the impoverished people who are visible everywhere on the streets.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. In the areas of Hebei occupied by Chiang's troops, heavy taxes and levies are causing landlords and peasants to abandon their land. According to an editorial in the Tianjin Yishibao on the 11th entitled "Land Available, No One to Cultivate," "Recently, a very peculiar phenomenon, unprecedented in history and fraught with great crisis, has emerged in the newly 'recovered' areas, namely 'land available, no one to cultivate.'" The editorial stated that the reason for this "tens of thousands of acres of fertile land无人问津" [idiom meaning "unvisited; uncared for; neglected"] is the excessive burden of taxes and levies. "For example, in Luan County, the minimum levy per acre is over 25,000 yuan, and the maximum is between 30,000 and 40,000 yuan. This does not include labor, cartage, requisition in kind, and 'normal' taxes and levies with various pretexts. If one also factors in the cost of labor, fertilizer, and losses from natural and man-made disasters, the income from the harvest is far from sufficient to cover expenses. Today, landlords are willing to rent out land to tenants for free, without collecting any rent. Tenants, however, are desperately pleading that whether or not they pay rent is irrelevant; the expenses are too great, and even farming for free results in losses, so they cannot cultivate the land." Furthermore, according to the Tianjin Dagongbao on December 30th, the price of land in Fengrun County, occupied by Chiang's troops, has fallen by half, from three shi of yellow corn per acre to one shi and five dou, yet there are still no buyers because of the heavy taxes. In December alone, the county levied a legal tax of 5,000 to 6,000 legal currency per acre, including fees for new recruits, horse fodder, firewood, education, and unnamed donations levied by companies. The newspaper also reported that in the Tangzitun area along the Jinpu Railway in Hebei, people "owing debts or being forced to sell their land due to excessive levies are a common sight."

　　蒋管区年关经济危机严重
    沪工商业相继破产
    河北蒋区苛杂繁重良田荒芜
    【新华社延安十六日电】蒋管区年关经济危机日益严重。据路透社及中央社十四日沪讯：蒋管区经济中心上海，在过去数日内，已有八十九家商店、及五十九家商业公司向市政府社会局注册宣告破产，另有六家毛织厂及十家其他工厂停工。同时期内，据中央社自己估计，另有二十余家商店未通知社会局而自行关闭。至阴历元旦期间，预料有更多的工厂商店歇业。华南方面，据中央社广州十五日电：在经济极度疲惫声中，各行商年关结算十九亏折，惟独舞场、银楼、茶馆等消费商业则生意鼎盛，开业者如雨后春笋。此一畸形繁荣现象，与踯躅街头触目皆是之贫民形成强烈对照。
    【新华社延安十六日电】河北蒋军侵占区苛杂繁重，地主农民纷纷抛弃土地。据天津益世报十一日发表题为“有地无人种”的社论称：“最近在新‘收复’地区发生一种极为奇特自古未见的潜伏着大危机的现象，就是‘有田无人种’。该社论称此种‘良田万顷无人问津’的原因，在于苛杂太重。“如滦县每亩地摊派最低亦为二万五千余元，高则在三、四万元之间，人工车马徵实及‘正常’有名堂之捐税尚不在内。倘再算上人工肥料的成本及天灾人祸之损失，则收成所得不敷开销甚远。今日地主均愿不收分文租佃给佃户白种，佃户则苦苦哀求拿租不拿租无关紧要，化销太大，白种也赔本，所以不能种了。”又据十二月三十日天津大公报载：蒋军侵占之丰润县土地价格跌落一半，即由每亩三石黄玉米跌至一石五斗，尚无人问津，其原因为捐税苛重。该县仅十二月一个月，收派的捐税每亩即合法币五、六千元，计有新兵费、马草、薪柴、教育费及公司摊派的未立名目的捐款等。该报并载冀属津浦路上的唐子屯一带人民“因收派过重而负债或不得不将地亩售出者，到处可闻”。
