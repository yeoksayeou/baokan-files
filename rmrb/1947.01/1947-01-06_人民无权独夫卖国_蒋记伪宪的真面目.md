The people have no right, the autocrat sells the country
——The True Face of the Chiang Kai-shek Puppet Constitution
Li Weihan

Chiang Kai-shek, ignoring the warnings of the Chinese Communist Party and the opposition of democratic parties and the people, brazenly carried the farce of the puppet National Assembly to the extreme, fabricating a "Constitution of the Republic of China" and issuing a nationwide celebration for three days, attempting to deceive the Chinese people and foreign people, and to put a "legal" cloak on his fascist dictatorship in order to further pursue his disastrous civil war and traitorous policies. However, this only shows that the Chiang dynasty, which has ruled China for twenty years, knows that things are not good and has become isolated among the broad masses of people, so it has to hide under the cloak of "constitutionalism" in an attempt to prolong its existence for a while. If the Qing Dynasty could continue to rule, it would not need to play the trick of "preparing for constitutionalism"; if the Chiang dynasty could continue to rule, it would not need to play the trick of "returning power to the people". This is what the Chiang dynasty needs to do, and the American imperialism also needs it to do, encouraging it to do so. Therefore, Truman personally came forward to support it (December 18th policy statement on China), and Stuart, more enthusiastically, praised it, saying that "the making of the Constitution of the Republic of China is indeed an auspicious sign for a happy China. This constitution not only conforms to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (!), but also is full of democratic spirit (!)." And "President Chiang overcame some difficulties with unprecedented courage for the passage of the constitution, which is especially admirable." (December 27th reception for Chinese and foreign journalists in Tianjin). On the stage of the puppet National Assembly, the head of the Chinese reactionaries and his lackeys sang and acted in a duet; behind the stage, the American reactionaries directed the duet for the Chinese reactionaries; and under the stage, the American reactionaries gave great support to the performers on the stage. After directing and supporting the show, what else will come? Naturally, it is military and economic assistance. Isn't it already clearly revealed in the lines of Truman's statement? All of this is the inside story of why the Chiang dynasty brazenly convened the puppet National Assembly and brazenly manufactured the puppet constitution. However, no matter what conspiracies and tricks the Chinese and American reactionaries play, the Chinese people cannot be deceived, nor can the people of the United States and other allied countries, and the fate of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution is destined to be spurned by the people.
    
    The Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution, in the name of the "Political Consultative Conference Draft Constitution" or the "Draft Constitution of Various Parties," attempts to deceive the people of the country. Regarding this point, I want to explain with the facts I personally experienced in participating in the deliberation of the draft constitution. Everyone knows that the Political Consultative Conference only resolved some principles for revising the May 5th Draft Constitution and had no specific amendments. And the major advantages of these principles, such as the protection of the people's freedom and rights, such as the system of balanced power and local autonomy, such as the autonomy of ethnic minorities, such as the informal National Assembly, such as the responsible cabinet system, have been basically overturned by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in March and completely destroyed by the puppet National Assembly. Although the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group held several meetings in March because the Kuomintang reactionaries demanded the overturning of the basic principles of the Political Consultative Conference, no final agreement has yet been reached, let alone amendments. Although the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Review Committee had reviewed Zhang Junmai's draft amendment, it was limited to the first and second chapters, and there were still unresolved points of contention. During the death of the CCP representatives Wang Ruofei and Qin Bangxian, the Review Committee appointed a group to continue working, but its authority was limited to studying issues and making suggestions, and it had no power to make any agreements. The work of this group not only did not involve a part of the chapters, but also, because of differing opinions, shelved many important issues related to the system of balanced power, the status of provincial autonomy, the responsible cabinet system, the people's freedom and rights, ethnic autonomy, the National Assembly, and the election system. Therefore, at the last meeting of the group, my representative (I was attending the group meeting for the first time) of the CCP delegation made the following oral statement: In view of the fact that the group had no right to agree, many important disputed issues were shelved without discussion, and the responsible representatives of the CCP were unable to attend due to circumstances, and the articles compiled by Secretary-General Lei Zhen were even more unfaithful, even arbitrarily adding and subtracting, the CCP delegation adopted a reserved attitude towards all the work of the group and all the articles compiled by Lei Zhen. In addition, Sun Ke had convened a meeting of the Review Group to discuss the issue of the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan, but no agreement was reached. All of the above processes took place before April 23rd. Since then, because Chiang Kai-shek was determined to fight a large-scale civil war, tearing up the Political Consultative Conference agreement and the principle of reviewing the constitution in the form of the Political Consultative Conference, until the eve of the convening of the puppet National Assembly, Chiang Kai-shek instructed Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingxiong, Lei Zhen, and others to supplement the above-mentioned articles compiled by Lei Zhen, and Chiang Kai-shek himself made deletions and revisions. (According to Wang Chonghui's report to the Legislative Yuan, Chiang Kai-shek at least deleted the item "Guarantee the autonomy of ethnic minorities living in certain areas," and at least moved "matters involving economic affairs" from the shared power of the central government and the provinces to the exclusive power of the central government, while the former was the only Political Consultative Conference principle remaining in Lei Zhen's compiled articles). Then, it was handed over to representatives of the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and "social elites" for review, called "Political Consultative Conference Draft Constitution" or "Draft Constitution of Various Parties." From this, it can be understood that the so-called "Political Consultative Conference Draft Constitution" or "Draft Constitution of Various Parties" is a fabrication that has nothing to do with the Political Consultative Conference, especially the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. In addition to Lei Zhen, Zhang Junmai, Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingxiong, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Sun Ke, and others, Chiang Kai-shek himself participated in this fabrication. He not only issued orders but also personally took action, and finally, it was manufactured by the puppet National Assembly representatives through a double act as before.

No matter how the fabricators play tricks and decorate the articles with some democratic words, the essence can only be naked dictatorship; otherwise, they would not need to tear up the Political Consultative Conference principles in every possible way. Facts speak louder than words. Let's look at the essence of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution and see whether it is a democratic constitution or the embodiment of dictatorship, whether it is the Political Consultative Conference principle or the anti-Political Consultative Conference principle. In order to determine democracy or dictatorship, the Political Consultative Conference or the anti-Political Consultative Conference, we should naturally not only analyze from each chapter, each article, and even each sentence of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution, but the most important thing is to see how it stipulates the people's freedom and rights, how it stipulates local autonomy and ethnic autonomy, and how it stipulates the central system and basic national policies, because these issues are the core of the Political Consultative Conference principles and also the core of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution.

A democratic constitution should first of all be a guarantee of the people's freedom and rights (Sun Yat-sen). That is to say, it should be directly guaranteed by the constitution, and the law should not restrict or deprive it. Therefore, one of the basic principles of the Political Consultative Conference is "All freedoms and rights that the people of democratic countries should enjoy should be guaranteed by the constitution and should not be illegally violated." The Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution is obviously contrary to this. It first lists some freedoms and rights (naturally biased towards the passive aspects and incomplete, mostly abstract), pretending to be something, and then comes Article 23, which cancels them all: "The freedom and rights listed in the above articles shall not be restricted by law, except when necessary to limit hindering the freedom of others, avoid emergency dangers, maintain social order or public interest." It is a pity that the trick of using the words "except," "outside," and "not" cannot conceal the original form of dictatorship. The original form is "The freedom and rights listed in the above articles may be restricted by law when necessary to limit hindering the freedom of others, avoid emergency dangers, maintain social order or public interest." Who determines this necessity, and who will legally restrict it? Naturally, it is not the people; they are just incompetent "Adou". Naturally, it is the dictatorial government; it is the "omnipotent" monarch. Isn't Zhu Xuefan being "injured," the Shanghai stall vendors' tragedy, and the arrest of three thousand people in Guangzhou overnight the best footnotes to this Article 23?

A democratic constitution should also be a guarantee of the people's right to autonomy. According to the principle of balanced power between the central government and the local governments, the provinces have the right to make their own constitutions and elect governors, combining the principle of autonomy to seek unity (Sun Yat-sen). Guarantee the people to implement local autonomy from the bottom up. Therefore, one of the basic principles of the Political Consultative Conference is: "Determine the province as the highest unit of local autonomy. The division of powers between the province and the central government is based on the principle of balanced power. It is stipulated that the provincial governor is elected by the people, and the province has the right to formulate a provincial constitution, but it shall not conflict with the national constitution." The Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution is obviously contrary to this: First, regarding the division of powers between the central government and the local governments in Chapter 10, the reader only needs to make a slight comparison to clearly see that the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution is not based on local autonomy, but on the starting point of central centralization. It does not assign the powers that the province can independently handle to the province, but leaves the remaining powers of the central government to the province. Therefore, the powers of the province after the implementation of "autonomy" are still as small and pitiful as they are now, that is, the powers of the province as the highest autonomous unit are still as small as the powers of the province as a national administrative region. What is the balance of power! According to Chapter 10 of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution, it is copied from the Cao Kun constitution. It is truly unparalleled! But the Chiang Kai-shek constitution is worse than the Cao Kun constitution. Readers can understand this by comparing them. Moreover, when disputes arise over powers that have not been rigidly listed, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution gives the Legislative Yuan the power to unilaterally resolve them, and the local governments have no choice but to obey. (Article 111) Second, the principle of "the province has the right to make its own provincial constitution" in Chapter 11 has been overturned. It is only allowed to formulate "provincial autonomy laws," and the formulation of "provincial autonomy laws" must be based on the "General Principles of Provincial and County Autonomy," and the power to formulate the "General Principles of Provincial and County Autonomy" belongs to the central government. What kind of general principles of autonomy will the central government formulate? God knows! "Articles 112 and 108" are no longer provincial constitutions, but only "provincial autonomy laws" based on a certain model, "General Principles of Provincial and County Autonomy." But even this is not enough, and it is also stipulated that "provincial autonomy laws" must not conflict with central laws because "provincial regulations that conflict with national laws are invalid." (Article 116) And "provincial autonomy laws" are only one type of "provincial regulations." As for when the central government will formulate what kind of "national laws" so that "provincial autonomy laws" cannot avoid conflicting with them, and therefore cannot avoid the fate of being declared invalid, only God knows! It is still not enough, and the power to interpret the so-called "conflict" and the power to resolve the so-called "obstacles" are unilaterally attributed to the central government, and the provinces have no choice but to obey. "Article 114: After the provincial autonomy law is formulated, it must be sent to the Judicial Yuan immediately. If the Judicial Yuan believes that there are unconstitutional provisions, it must declare the unconstitutional provisions invalid." "Article 117: When there is doubt about whether provincial regulations conflict with national laws, the Judicial Yuan shall interpret it." "Article 115: If a major obstacle occurs in the implementation of the provincial autonomy law due to one of its provisions, the President of the Judicial Yuan shall convene relevant parties to present their opinions, and the President of the Executive Yuan, the President of the Legislative Yuan, the President of the Judicial Yuan, the President of the Examination Yuan, and the President of the Control Yuan shall organize a committee, with the President of the Judicial Yuan as the chairman, to propose a solution." From this, it can be understood that in the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution, "balanced power" should be interpreted as "centralization," and "autonomy" should be interpreted as "self-restraint." True balanced power, true local autonomy, especially with the province as the highest autonomous unit, cannot even be found in the shadows. Whoever doesn't believe it, go and look for it.

China is a multi-ethnic country, and as a democratic constitution, it should also be a guarantee of the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities. According to Sun Yat-sen's principle of ethnic equality within the country, the autonomous rights of all ethnic minorities should be guaranteed. Therefore, one of the basic principles of the Political Consultative Conference is: "The autonomous rights of ethnic minorities living in certain areas should be guaranteed." The Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution is obviously contrary to this. After overturning the above principle of the Political Consultative Conference, in order to deceive, it added "Article 119: The autonomous system of the Mongolian ethnic groups in various Mongolian regions shall be determined by law" at the end of Chapter 11 on local systems; "Article 120: The Tibetan autonomous system shall also be guaranteed." As mentioned earlier, even the shadow of local autonomy cannot be found for the Han people. Would it suddenly favor the Mongolians and Tibetans? The "National Assembly representatives" of Mongolia and Tibet quarreled, and they had to add two hypocritical articles to prevaricate them. Moreover, there is also the constraint of "legal definition." Moreover, the above two articles and other articles involving ethnic minorities in the Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution, on the one hand, are only hypocritical deception to the Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups, and on the other hand, they give the Hui ethnic group an extremely great Han chauvinistic insult even more than other non-frontier ethnic groups. Not only do they deny their autonomous rights, but they also deny their ethnic status.

According to China's national conditions, a democratic constitution should adopt a responsible cabinet system, that is, a parliamentary cabinet system, for the central system. Therefore, one of the basic principles of the Political Consultative Conference is, "The Legislative Yuan is the national legislative body... its functions are equivalent to the parliament of a democratic country. The Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan. If the Legislative Yuan has no confidence in the entire Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan shall either resign or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, but the same President of the Executive Yuan shall not request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan again." The Chiang Kai-shek puppet constitution is obviously contrary to this. It not only overturned the above provisions on the right of no confidence and the right of dissolution, but also further overturned the principle of "the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan" and changed it to "the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the following provisions." (Article 57). What are the left-listed provisions? They are: "(1) The Executive Yuan has the responsibility to submit policy guidelines and policy reports to the Legislative Yuan, and the members of the Legislative Yuan have the right to question the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan during meetings; (2) If the Legislative Yuan does not approve of the important policies of the Executive Yuan, it may pass a resolution requesting the Executive Yuan to change it. The Executive Yuan may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider the resolution. If two-thirds of the members of the Legislative

    人民无权独夫卖国
    ——蒋记伪宪的真面目
    李维汉
    蒋介石悍然不顾中共的警告，不顾民主党派和人民的反对，把伪国大丑剧扮演到无穷的境地，伪造了一部《中华民国宪法》，并通令全国庆祝三天，企图拿它来欺骗中国人民，也欺骗外国人民，给他的法西斯独裁统治披上“合法”外衣，更加遂行其祸国殃民的内战政策与卖国政策。然而，这只是显得统治中国二十年的蒋记皇朝已知不妙，已经在广大人民中孤立起来了，所以不得不躲在“宪政”外衣下，企图苟延一时。如果满清皇朝能够照旧统治下去，它就无需玩弄“筹备立宪”；如果蒋记皇朝能够照旧统治下去，也就无需玩弄“还政于民”。这是蒋记皇朝需要这样作，美帝国主义也需要它这样做，鼓励它这样作，所以杜鲁门亲自出面支持（十二月十八日对华政策声明），司徒雷登更大为捧场，说什么“中华民国宪法之制成，实系幸福中国之吉兆，此一宪法既符合于政协决议，（！）尤充满民主精神（！）”。而“蒋主席为宪法之通过，曾以空前之勇气克服若干困难，尤足钦佩”。（十二月二十七日在天津招待中外记者）在伪国大的台前，中国反动派头子与其喽罗唱演双簧；在其后台，美国反动派给中国反动派导演双簧；而在台下，美国反动派给台上大捧其场。导演过了，捧场过了，接着而来的还有什么呢？自然是军事的和经济的援助。杜鲁门声明的字里行间，不是已经透露明白了么？所有这一切，就是蒋记皇朝所以悍然召开伪国大与悍然制造伪宪法的内幕。然而，不管中国的和美国的反动派他们干什么阴谋诡计，（中缺十四字）中国人民是欺骗不了的，美国和其他盟国的人民也欺骗不了，而蒋记伪宪的命运，则已经注定了必定被人民所唾弃。（中缺数字）
    蒋记伪宪以“政协宪草”或“各党派宪草”的名义，企图以之蒙蔽国人。关于这一点，我要以参加宪草审议所亲历的事实来说明。谁都知道，政协会议只议决了些五五宪草的修改原则，并无具体修正案。而这些原则中的重大优点，如人民自由权利之保障，如地方均权制与地方自治制，如少数民族自治权，如无形国大，如责任内阁制，已被三月国民党二中全会基本推翻，又被伪国大破坏干净了。政协综合小组虽因国民党反动派要求推翻政协基本原则，曾在三月间集议数次，但迄无最后协议，更说不上修正案。政协宪草审议委员会虽曾就张君劢修正草案作过审议，但只限于第一、第二两章，而且也保留有争议未决之点。在中共代表王若飞、秦邦宪两同志遇难期间，审议委员会曾指定一个小组继续工作，但其职权仅限于研究问题提出意见，无权作任何协议。该小组的工作，不但在章节上有一部分未曾涉及，而且对已经涉及过的章节，更因为议论不一，搁置了许多重要问题，特别是与均权制、省自治地位、责任内阁制、人民自由权利、民族自治、国民大会及选举制度等有关的问题。因此在该小组的最后一次会议上，我代表（在我是初次出席该小组会议）中共代表团提出如下口头声明：鉴于小组本无协议权，许多重要争执问题又搁置未议，加以中共负责代表因故未能出席，而由雷震秘书长整理的条文更多不忠实，甚至任意添减，故中共代表团对小组全部工作及雷震整理的全部条文，概采保留态度。除此之外，孙科又曾召集过一次审议小组的会议，商谈行政院对立法院负责问题亦无协议，而所有上述经过，都是四月二十三日以前的事情。自彼时以后，因为蒋介石存心大打内战，撕毁政协协议和以政协形式的宪草审议原则，直到伪国大开会的前夕，蒋介石才指令王宠惠、吴经熊、雷震等就上述雷震整理的条文加以补充，另由蒋介石自己加以删改。（据王宠惠在立法院的报告，蒋介石至少删去了“聚居一定地方的少数民族保障其自治权”一项，至少把“涉及经济事项”从中央与省共有事权移入中央专有事权，而前者则是雷震整理条文中仅存的政协原则）。然后交给所谓国民党、青年党、民社党及“社会贤达”代表审议，名曰“政协宪草”或“各党派宪草”，由此可以明白所谓“政协宪草”或“各党派宪草”云云，完全是与政协，尤其与政协原则无关的伪造。参加此一伪造者，除雷震、张君劢、王宠惠、吴经熊、曾琦、陈启天、孙科等人外，还有蒋介石自己。他不仅发号施令，而且亲自动了手，最后则经过全体伪国大代表的双簧如法泡制。
    不管伪造者怎样玩弄手法，怎样在条文上装饰若干民主词句，但骨子里只能是赤裸裸的独裁主义，否则他们就不需要千方百计地撕毁政协原则了。事实胜于雄辩，看看蒋记伪宪的实质罢，看看它究竟是民主宪法还是独裁主义的化身，是政协原则还是反政协原则？为要判明民主或独裁，政协或反政协，自然不仅从蒋记伪宪的每一章节、每一条文乃至每一文句去分析，但最主要的是要看他怎样规定人民自由权利，怎样规定地方自治与民族自治，怎样规定中央制度与基本国策，因为这些问题是政协原则的核心，也是蒋记伪宪的核心。
    一个民主宪法，它首先应该是人民自由权利的保障书（孙中山）。就是说，由宪法直接加以保障，法律不得加以限制或剥夺，所以政协基本原则之一“凡民主国家人民应享之自由及权利，均应受宪法之保障，不受非法之侵犯”。蒋记伪宪显然与此相反，它首先罗列一些自由及权利（自然是偏于消极方面的，而且不完全的，绝大多数是抽象的），装装样子，然后就来一个第二十三条，将它们一笔勾销：“以上各条列举之自由权利，除为限止妨碍他人自由，避免紧急危难，维持社会秩序或公共利益所必要者外，不得以法律限制之”。可怜得很，单靠“除”“外”“不”几个字的花样，掩盖不了独裁主义的原形。原形就是这“以上各条列举之自由权利，为限止妨碍他人自由，避免紧急危难，维持社会秩序或公共利益所必要时，得以法律限制之”。谁定这个必要，又谁来加以法律限制呢？自然不是人民，他们只是无能的“阿斗”，自然是独裁政府，它才是“万能”的君宰。难道朱学范被“撞伤”，上海摊贩惨案，广州一夜逮捕三千人，不是这第二十三条的最好注脚！！
    一个民主宪法，它又应该是人民自治权利的保障书。依中央与地方均权，省得自制省宪法，选举省长，以自治主义相结合以谋统一的原则（孙中山）。保障人民实行自下而上的地方自治。所以政协基本原则之一：“确定省为地方自治之最高单位，省与中央权限之划分依据均权主义，规定省长民选，省得制定省宪，但不得与国宪抵触”。蒋记伪宪显然与此相反：第一、其第十章各条关于中央与地方权限之划分，读者只要略加比较，即可显然看出蒋记伪宪不是以地方自治为基础，而是以中央集权为出发点；不是将省能独立办理的事权划归于省，而是将中央集中的残余遗给于省。因此实行“自治”后的省的权限，仍然像现在一样微小得可怜，也就是作为最高自治单位的省的权限，仍然微小得等于作为国家行政区域的省的权限，有何均权之可言！按蒋记伪宪法第十章乃系抄袭曹锟宪法而来，真是无独有偶，一邱之貉！但蒋记比曹记更坏，读者试加以比较，就可明白，而且对于未经硬性列举之事权在发生争议时，蒋记伪宪更赋予立法院以片面解决之权，地方唯有俯首服从。（第一百十一条）第二、其第十一章关于地方制定“省得自制省宪”之原则被推翻了，只许制定“省自治法”，而“省自治法”之制定，必须依据“省县自治通则”；而制定“省县自治通则”之大权，则属之中央。中央将制定一种什么样的自治通则？鬼知道！“第一百十二条、第一百零八条”已经不是省宪，而只是依据一定模型“省县自治通则”“制定的普通法律”“省自治法”了。但犹以为不足，又规定“省自治法”不得与中央法律抵触，因为“省法规与国家法律抵触者无效”。（第一百十六条）而“省自治法”则不过是“省法规”之一种而已。至于中央将于何时制定何种“国家法律”，致“省自治法”无法避免与之发生抵触，从而无法避免某条遭受宣告无效的命运，又只有鬼才知道！此犹不足，更将所谓“抵触”的解释权及所谓“障碍”的解决权，片面地归诸中央，省只得俯首听命。“第一百一十四条：省自治法制定后，须即送司法院，司法院如认为有违宪之处，须将违宪条文宣布无效”，“第一百十七条：省法规与国家法律有无抵触发生疑义时，由司法院解释之”，“第一百十五条：省自治法施行中，如因其中某条发生重大障碍，经司法院召集有关方面陈述意见后，由行政院院长、立法院院长、司法院院长、考试院院长与监察院院长组织委员会，司法院院长为主席提出方案解决之”。由此可以明白，在蒋记伪宪里“均权”应作“集权”解，“自治”应作“自制”解。真的均权，真的地方自治，尤其省为最高自治单位，是连影子也找不到的。谁要不相信，谁就去找找看。
    中国是多民族国家，作为民主宪法，它又应该是少数民族自治权利的保障书。依孙中山国内民族平等的原则，保障一切少数民族的自治权利，所以政协基本原则之一：“聚居一定地方的少数民族，应保障其自治权”。蒋记伪宪显然与此相反，它将政协上项原则推翻之后，为了欺骗，于第十一章地方制度之末尾，添上“第一百十九条，蒙古各蒙族地方自治制度以法律定之”；“第一百二十条，西藏自治制度并应加以保障”。前面说过，对于汉人连地方自治的影子也找不到，难道会忽然厚爱于蒙人和藏人么？蒙藏的“国大代表”吵了嘴，不得不添上两条虚伪的条文搪塞一下罢了，何况又有“法律定义”的约束。而且蒋记伪宪里的上述两条及其他涉及少数民族的条款，一方面固然对蒙、藏民族只是虚伪的欺骗，另方面更对回族尤比其他非边疆民族给以极端大汉族主义的侮辱，不仅否定了他们的自治权，而且连他们的民族地位也否定了。
    按照中国的国情，一个民主宪法应该给中央制度采取责任内阁制，亦即议会内阁制。所以政协基本原则之一，“立法院为国家立法机关……其职权相当于民主国家之议会，行政院对立法院负责，如立法院对行政院全体不信任时，行政院或辞职或提请总统解散立法院，但同一行政院长不得再提请解散立法院”。蒋记伪宪显然与此相反，它不仅推翻了上述不信任权与解散权的规定，而且进一步推翻了“行政院对立法院负责”的原则，改为“行政院依左列规定对立法院负责”。（第五十七条）。什么是左列规定呢？就是：“（１）行政院有向立法院提出施政方针及施政报告之责，立法委员在开会时，有向行政院院长及行政院各部会首长提出质询之权；（２）立法院对于行政院之重要政策不赞同时，得以决议移请行政院变更之，行政院对于立法院之决议，得经总统之核可移请立法院复议，复议时如经出席立法委员三分之二维持原议，行政院院长应即接受该决议或辞职；（３）行政院对立法院决议之法律案、预算案、条约案，如认为该决议案有碍难行时，得经总统之核可于该决议案送达行政院十日内移请立法案复议，复议时如经立法委员出席之三分之二维持原案，行政院院长应即接受该决议案或辞职”。除此之外，还有“第七十二条：立法院法律案通过后移送总统及行政院，总统应于收到后十日内公布之，但总统如不同意时，得依照本宪法第五十七条之规定办理”。清楚了吧，总统有权否决立法院的任何决议案，而立法院必须有出席委员的三分之二的一致才能抵制得住总统的否决权，如果是六百个立法委员，就需要整整四百零一个才能够得上抵制。在国民党员占多数的立法院内，这种三分之二的一致是永远不会出现的，因为他们在“党纪”和总裁训话的面前，惟有“鸦雀无声”、“胆战心惊”而已！此犹不足，张君劢还出来“锦上添花”，加上“第四十四条：总统对于院与院间的争执，除本宪法有规定者外，得召集有关各院院长会商解决之”。孙科在伪国大报告时，将这一条的天机泄露出来了，他说：“将来遇有争执，大都是立法院对行政院方面的”。好家伙，有了否决权还不够，还要直接来一个御前裁决；此犹不足，蒋记伪宪为了彻底剥夺立法院的权力，而无限扩张总统的权力，又提出一个六年召集一次的，由一两千人组成的所谓国民大会来做所谓国家最高政权机关。其第二十五条：“国民大会依宪法之规定，代表全国国民行使政权”。这样一来，立法院就在法律上也降为一个技术机关，“全国国民”要六年才能在个把月中演一次“行使政权”的滑稽戏，这幕滑稽戏不消说还是“绝对服从”总统一人导演的，有此次伪国大为证。而在其余五年十个月里，就在名义上亦干脆由总统“代表全国国民行使政权”。此犹不足，更加以无条件地“统率全国海陆空军”，（第三十六条）掌握“紧急命令”大权，（第四十三条）真是“朕即国家”。袁皇帝、曹总统有灵，亦要废然长叹自愧不及！孙科在伪国大报告时，对这种“集权于一人”的独裁制度阿谀为“修正的总统制”，请问孙科先生这是从什么总统制修正过来的呢？从美国总统制么？又是向那边修正？向责任内阁制还是向个人独裁制修正的呢？从政协会议的责任内阁制，一下子翻成个人独裁制，万事皆备，只缺少一件黄袍，倘若天从人愿，参加伪造诸君大可“弹冠相庆”，惟须当心做洪宪第二！
    有一位著名的法学家批评“五五宪草”的实质是“人民无权，政府有权；地方无权，中央有权；立法无权，总统有权”。这批评得很深刻，稍为简约一下，就是人民无权，地方无权，议会无权，总统个人集权，再简约一下，就是个人独裁制。而今伪国大的杰作，把“五五宪法草案”改成所谓“中华民国宪法”名改实未改，换汤不换药，连吴经熊也被迫承认这一点。
    什么是民主宪法呢？主权在民，一切权利属于人民的，人民为国家之主人。蒋记伪宪怎样呢？人民之自由权利被钩销了，人民之自治权也被取消了，少数民族之自治权利被否定了，人民经过自己的代表去管理国家政权的权利也被否决了，国家全部权利集中于中央，而中央则拱手听命于总统独裁。所以，蒋记伪宪的精髓和实质，可以八个字概括尽之：人民无权，独夫集权。蒋记伪宪还有一个重要部分，即第十三章关于基本国策，那同样是把政协基本精神阉割了的。例如：政治方面，联合政府的影子也找不到；外交方面，找不到关于保护国家之权的规定；军事方面，军民分治，以政治军的原则被抹去了；经济方面，耕者有其田、劳动者有职业、企业者有发展机会，而官僚资本，必须被取缔与惩罚等原则被湮没了；文化教育方面，发展国民民主精神与保障学术自由之原则被删除了，罗列了许多便于独裁统治利用、或不着边际、或永远不准备兑现的东西。而对于广大人民急切的基本要求，并已为政协各种决议明确规定了的，则加以阉割和抹煞。蒋记伪宪第十三章的秘密，便是如此。
    要批评蒋记伪宪的其他章节和其他条款，还可继续写下去，但已用不着了。
    中国人民诚然需要一个民主宪法，且距离享有一个民主宪法的日子也已经不很远了。中国人民从自己的历史中取得了一个重要经验，即是没有民主联合政府，即不可能有民主宪法的产生，更不可能有民主宪法的实施。历史又一次证明，从国民党反动派那里得不到任何民主宪法；能得到的，只是独裁制度。尽管蒋记伪宪的某些条款为若干虚伪的民主字句所装饰着，也无法掩盖其独裁主义的实质。而且我敢断言，国民党反动派马上要利用“行宪”为借口来更加压迫剥削人民，出卖国家主权，继续进攻解放区。我们且不说国民党反动派在二十年前一翻脸就将孙中山先生手订的国民党第一次代表大会宣言推翻了，九个月前他们再一翻脸又将政协决议撕毁了；我们且退一万步说，十五年前他们不是也颁布了一个“训政时期约法”？那上边不是也写上过“人民自由”的条文、也写上过“国民生计”与“中央与地方均权”的条文？但十五年来，人民自由在那里？国民生计在那里？中央与地方均权又在那里？十个月前，蒋介石不是亲口发出了关于人民自由自治权利的四项诺言？但十个月来人民真有了自由吗？政党真有了合法地位吗？地方真有了自治吗？政治犯真获得了释放吗？反动统治愈是孤立愈是软弱，就愈是乞怜于欺骗与诡诈。但谁要想从它那里取得真民主、真自由，就等于与虎谋皮！
    民主自由、民主联合政府、民主宪法只能是人民斗争的果实。奋斗吧！为民主、为自由、为民主联合政府、为民主宪法奋斗到底吧！
