    The Japanese Communist Party
    The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) was founded in July 1922. It is the vanguard of the Japanese working class and represents the interests of Japanese workers, peasants, and the broad masses of the people. From the day of its establishment, it led the Japanese people in resolutely opposing the military-fascists and their various wars of aggression. Therefore, the first action of the JCP after its establishment was the struggle against Japan's dispatch of troops to Siberia. In 1927, under the leadership of the Comintern, the JCP overcame the ultra-left tendencies of "Fukumotoism" and moved in the direction of massification and Bolshevization. In early 1928, in the general election of the Japanese parliament, the JCP utilized the election struggle and two left-wing members were elected. On September 18, 1931, when Japanese imperialism launched a war of aggression against Northeast China, the JCP vigorously exposed its aggressive nature and led the people in struggle against the military. In 1935, the Japanese Communist Party had more than three thousand members and thirty-three thousand sympathizers.
    After the July 7th Incident, the JCP always concentrated the strength of the entire party to lead the workers, peasants, and oppressed classes in struggle. In these struggles, many leaders, cadres, and members of the party were arrested and killed. In 1945, there were 1,200 members of the Party, and the Party's organization was repeatedly destroyed, but the JCP was not deterred by the bloody suppression of the ruling class. On the first day after the surrender of Japan, JCP leaders Kyuichi Tokuda and other comrades were released from prison and led the people to struggle for the elimination of military-fascism and the construction of a democratic Japan, and repeatedly proposed to various democratic parties to organize a democratic front. After Comrade Okano Susumu, a JCP leader who led the Japanese people's anti-war movement in North China in 1945, returned to China, the Japanese Democratic Front was organized with the JCP as its head.
    The new leadership organ of the JCP, the Central Committee, was elected at the Fourth National Congress held in November 1945. The Central Committee members included Okano Susumu, Kyuichi Tokuda, Shiga Yoshio, Kim Dae-hae, Hageta Satomi, Kamiyama Shigeo, Miyamoto Kenji, Kuroda Jugo and other comrades. The new democratic struggle program was adopted at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Congress held in February last year. At this time, the number of party members increased to 6,800. By the end of May last year, the JCP had reached 20,000 members. From December 1945 to May 1946, within half a year, the number of JCP members had increased more than 18 times, and it led more than 2 million trade union members. In the Japanese general election in April last year, the JCP had six members of parliament. The JCP National Congress, which began on the 6th of this month, announced that the number of JCP members has increased to 59,000, which means that it has more than doubled in the half year from May last year to the present. This shows that the JCP is developing rapidly.
    In the past year, the democratic movements launched by the broad masses of the Japanese people, such as the food struggle, opposition to the Yoshida military clique forming a cabinet, opposition to the Yoshida government, anti-strike bills, opposition to the Labor-Management Adjustment Law, and the anti-Yoshida government's "October Offensive" and the million-worker general strike, were all led by the JCP. The JCP was not only the bravest anti-war and anti-military warrior and guide during the war, but also the helmsman for building a new democratic Japan after the war, and an indispensable force for guaranteeing permanent peace in the Far East.

    日本共产党
    日本共产党成立于一九二二年七月，它是日本工人阶级的先锋队，代表日本工农和广大人民的利益。从成立的那一天起，它便领导日本人民坚决进行反军部法西斯及其各次侵略战争。因此日本共产党成立后第一个行动，就是反对日本出兵西伯利亚的斗争。一九二七年，日共在共产国际领导之下，克服了“福本主义”的极左倾向，而向群众化及布尔什维克化的方向前进。一九二八年初，日本议会总选举，日共利用选举斗争，当选了两名左翼议员。一九三一年“九一八”，日本帝国主义对我国东北进行侵略战争，日共极力揭露其侵略性并领导人民与军部进行斗争。一九三五年，日本共产党有三千以上的党员和三万三千的同情者。
    七七事变以后，日共始终是集中全党的力量，领导工农及被压迫的阶层进行斗争，在这些斗争中，党的许多领袖干部及党员都被捕杀了。一九四五年备有党员一千二百名，党的组织也屡遭破坏，但日共并未因统治阶级血腥的弹压而吓退。日本投降后，日共领袖德田球一等同志出狱的第一天，便领导人民为肃清军部法西斯及建设民主日本而斗争，并向各民主党派再三提议组织民主阵线。四五年在华北领导日本人民反战运动的日共领袖冈野进同志回国后，日本民主阵线即以日共为首而组织起来了。
    日共今天新领导机关中央委员会，于一九四五年十一月举行的第四届全国代表大会选出，中央委员中包括冈野进、德田球一、志贺义雄、金大海、裤田里美、神山茂夫、宫本显、黑本重德等同志，并在去年二月间召开的四届五全大会中通过了新的民主斗争纲领，这时党员增至六千八百名。到去年五月末，日共党员已达两万人，自一九四五年十二月至一九四六年五月半年内，日共党员新增加了十八倍以上，并领导工会会员二百多万。在去年四月日本大选中，日共拥有议员六名。本月六日开始举行的日共全国代表大会宣布日共党员已增至五万九千名，就是从去年五月到现在的半年内，又增加了两倍多。这表明了日共是在迅速的发展着。
    去年一年中，日本广大人民所掀起的民主运动，如粮食斗争，反对吉田军阀组阁，反对吉田政府，反罢工法案，反对劳资调整法，与反吉田政府的“十月攻势”及百万工人大罢工，日共都是领导者。日共不仅在战时是最勇敢的反战反军部的战士和指导者，战后并且是建立新民主主义日本舵手，是保证远东永久和平的不可缺少的力量。
