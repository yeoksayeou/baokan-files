　　The Rebirth of Landlord Lin Deshan
　　Wu Xiang
　　Lin Deshan was a landlord from Lin Village, north of Tangyi City. His cousin, Lin Dechang, was a poor peasant. Last September, the masses in Tangyi launched a vigorous movement to overturn their lives. Lin Deshan, fearing struggle, fled to Liaocheng city, which was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, to hide. Lin Dechang, however, bravely joined the Eighth Route Army to defend the land he had been allocated.

　　For a full year and three months, the brothers had no news of each other.

　　On a cold winter night, the starlight glittered on the ice floes of Liaocheng's wide moat. As usual, the entrenchments of the Eighth Route Army, a little more than a hundred meters from the city, broadcast a shout: "Brothers, let's have a chat!"

　　"Let's have a chat!" The reply from the city wall was listless: "Are you from Tangyi? Your accent sounds like my hometown." "Yes." This sentence was more energetic: "Which village?" "Lin Village." From the entrenchments came a joyful shout: "Are you Deshan?" From the city wall came a joyful shout: "Are you Dechang?" "Hurry down with your gun!" "Won't you kill me?" "No, don't worry, I guarantee it." "Wait a minute, wait a minute, the officer is coming." The patrolman trudged back and forth. Lin Deshan anxiously waited, the interrupted conversation unable to continue. But from then on, Lin Deshan spent night after night unable to sleep. How many unutterable pains and regrets he had! He hadn't found what he expected when he fled to the city, and when his money ran out, he couldn't leave. He was forced into the army, beaten and starved every day, only able to drink thin gruel, and wearing tattered single-layer clothing in the freezing cold. He had suffered miseries he hadn't experienced in generations. Because of a moment of folly, he had ended up as a traitor. Now he truly had no face to meet his fellow villagers. Thinking it over, he remembered Dechang's words. A bright road to self-renewal appeared before him, and he made his decision. Courage also came. On the night of December 17th, it was his turn to guard the city again. He tied his leggings together, fastened them to the crenellations, and carrying the Hubei-made rifle he had stolen from the company headquarters, with plenty of bullets, he slid down the city wall. By the time the north of the city realized there was shooting, he was already in the entrenchments of the Eighth Route Army.

　　Lin Deshan was treated very well after he arrived at the Eighth Route Army. Feeling unable to repay them, he volunteered to go to the front line to shout to the city. The officers on the city wall heard him and ordered the soldiers to fire. He said, "I'm in the entrenchments, it's a waste of bullets to shoot. Keep the bullets and bring them to the Eighth Route Army, there's a reward. I'm shouting for your own good, don't be without conscience."

　　Once, Lin Deshan suddenly disappeared. He couldn't be found anywhere. When he returned, everyone learned that he had gone to play at Lin Dechang's company. Everyone said, "We all thought you had run away again." He replied with a smile, "Run away? Even if you offered to send me, I wouldn't go. The comrades in Dechang's company are all engaged in a campaign to win merit, and I also want to accumulate some merit to atone for my sins!"

　　Now the Eighth Route Army has written him a certificate, given him 1,000 yuan for travel expenses, and told him to go home. Before leaving, he also said, "I'm going home to take a look, and then I'll come back."

　　地主林得山新生
    吴象
    林德山是堂邑城北林庄的地主，他的堂兄林德昌却是个贫农。去年九月堂邑群众掀起了轰轰烈烈的翻身运动，林德山怕斗争，就逃到蒋伪军盘据着的聊城城里躲起来了。林德昌却为了保卫自己分得的土地，英勇地参加了八路军。
    整整一年又三个月了，弟兄们相互间没有音讯。
    严寒的冬夜，星光在聊城宽宽的护城河的冰块上闪亮。和往常一样，距城一百多米的八路军的工事里送出了喊话声：“弟兄们，拉两句吧”！
    “拉两句吧！”城墙上的回答很没精打采：“你是堂邑的不是？听你口音像我老乡呀。”“是的。”这一句起劲了些：“那个村？”“林庄。”工事里的惊喜地叫喊了：“你是得山吗？”城墙上的也惊喜地叫喊了：“你是得昌吗？”“赶快带枪下来吧！”“不会杀我吗？”“不杀，不要紧，我给你保证。”“等等说，等等说，官长来了。”查哨的蹒跚地来回走着，林得山煎熬熬地等候着，被打断了的对话始终没有能继续下去。但是林得山却从此一晚又一晚的睡不着了，他有多少不能告人的痛苦和愧悔！逃到城里来指望的没有指望上，钱用完人也出不去了，被逼着当了兵，成天挨打挨饿，只能喝稀糊糊，快数九的天还穿着破单衣，几辈子没受过的罪都受了；自己一念之差，竟落了个汉奸下场，现在却是真没有脸和乡亲见面了。想来想去，他想起了得昌的话，一条自新的光明大道出现在他的面前，决心下了。勇气也来了。十二月十七日夜晚，又轮到他守城了。他把绑腿接起来，拴到垛口上，大背着从连部偷来的湖北造，带足子弹，顺着城墙滑下来。等到城北发觉打枪时，他已经到了八路军的工事里了。
    林得山到八路军后，很受优待。他觉得无法报答，就自动要求到阵地上去喊话。城墙上官长听见了，命令士兵开枪。他说：“我在工事里，打枪也是白费，子弹留着带到八路军来有奖。我喊话是为你们好，一个人不要没有良心。”
    有一次，林得山忽然不见了，到处找不到，回来后才知道他到林得昌连上玩去了，大家说：“我们都以为你又逃跑了呢。”他笑着回答说：“逃跑？送我去也不肯去。德昌连上同志们都在搞立功运动，我也要多立点功，好将功折罪呀！”
    现在八路军给他写了证明书，送他一千元路费，叫他回家去。临走，他还说：“回家看看我还要来。”
