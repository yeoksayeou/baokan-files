　　Editor-Reader Chat
    Every time we receive letters from readers with opinions on the supplement, we are as happy as if we have found a treasure, because those opinions give us great encouragement and education. We sincerely and greedily hope that we can continue to receive your letters.

    Comrades Xiao Jian and Xiu Shan are right, in the past the supplement "did not reprint enough of the relatively fair speech and communications from the newspapers in the KMT-controlled areas." Recently, we have been remedying this shortcoming. We plan to not only introduce some fair speeches from the KMT-controlled areas in the future, but also reprint some fair speeches from the international community and other good articles from the liberated areas.

    In the past, there were indeed not enough articles on learning and ideological education, and we have long felt this. The journal published a notice on the 19th soliciting manuscripts in this area. We hope everyone will work together to make it happen. Moreover, it is not limited to articles, but also problems in discussions and good experiences in learning, you can contact us. Comrades Xi Yigen and others asked whether learning and economic construction could be turned into special columns or special issues. It is not possible at present, but we will see how things develop in the future!

    Comrades Kefeng and others suggested that the supplement should become a garden for literary exercises. We also have the same wish. In this regard, we have published some poems, dramas, ballads, clappers, sketches, and woodcuts, but there are not many novels. We hope that everyone can create some short stories depicting typical characters in the emancipation and self-defense war. Of course, we also welcome good full-length novels.

    Comrades Liu Zhengyi and others all requested that "Book and Newspaper Reviews" can be regular. We request that after everyone reads new books and newspapers and magazines, they can write down their own experiences, and we ourselves plan to spend more effort in organizing them in the future.

    Comrade Wang Cheng suggested writing articles in local languages. We think that in order to write about real people's lives, it is possible and welcome to use refined dialects and local expressions in literary works. However, we must also pay attention to the fact that this journal is for the entire region, and too many obscure dialects will easily make it difficult for everyone to understand.

    The typesetting should be flexible, and too much "fancy" is not good. Comrade Xi Yigen's suggestion is very good, and we should pay attention to it in the future, to be clear and lively without losing its elegance.

    We ask that the manuscripts be on manuscript paper, (if there is no manuscript paper, leave more blank space between the lines) write the words clearly, and avoid writing on both sides. For duplicated manuscripts, we hope that the handwriting can be clear and easy to read. Do not write the author's signature in cursive. This will make it easier for us to understand the content of the original manuscript, reduce the time for editing, revising, typesetting, and proofreading, and avoid errors in your hard work.

　　编读谈心
    每当我们接得读者们对副刊的意见信时，高兴得如获至宝，因为那些意见给了我们很大鼓舞与教益，我们热诚而贪婪地希望着：能继续不断的获得你们的来信。

    肖健、秀山等同志说得对，过去副刊“对蒋管区比较公正的报张上的言论及通讯等转载得不够”，近来我们已在补救这一缺陷。打算今后不仅介绍一些蒋管区的公正言论，同时将转载一些国际上的公正言论及其它解放区的好文章。
      ×    ×    ×
    对学习及思想教育上的文章，过去确实登载得不够，我们也早已感觉到，十九日本刊已登出启事，征求这方面的文稿，望希大家共同努力把它搞起来。而且也不限于文章，讨论中有问题，学习中有好的经验，都可以和我们联系。席一根同志等问是否把学习和经济建设辟成专栏或专刊，目前尚不可能，将来看情形办吧！

    可风等同志提议使副刊成为文艺习作的园地，我们也有同样愿望，在这方面曾发表过些诗歌、戏剧、坠子、快板、小品及木刻等，只是小说不多，希望大家能创作些描写翻身和自卫战争中典型人物的短篇小说来，当然，好的长篇我们也欢迎。
      ×    ×    ×
    刘正一等同志都要求“书报评介”能经常有，我们要求是大家看了新的书报杂志后，能将自己的心得写来，我们自己今后也打算更多花力量去组织。
      ×    ×    ×
    王诚同志提出文章用地方语言来写，我们想：为了写出真实的人民生活来，在文艺作品中采用精炼的方言土语，那是可以的，也是欢迎的。但也要注意本刊是给全区看的，偏僻的土语方言太多，就容易使大家看不懂。
      ×    ×    ×
    排版要灵活，太“花梢”了不好。席一根同志这个意见很好，今后我们应注意，要作到清醒活泼，而不失其大方。
      ×    ×    ×
    我们要求来稿最好稿纸，（没有稿纸也要把行间空白留多点）字要写清楚，切忌两面写，复写的稿，希望字迹能清晰易看，作者签名不要草书连写。这样就可以使我们容易了解原稿的内容，编、改、排、校的时间都减少，也免得在你的心血之作中弄出错误。
