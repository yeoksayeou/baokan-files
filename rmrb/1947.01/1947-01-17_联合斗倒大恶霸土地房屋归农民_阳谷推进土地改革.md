　　Joint Struggle to Overthrow the Big Despot, Land and Houses Returned to Peasants
    Yanggu Promotes Land Reform
    [From our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 15th] The land reform movement in Yanggu is underway. More than ten villages, including Chenji in the Fifth District, jointly overthrew the big despot landlord Chen Zhaowan and others, and more than three hectares of land were returned to the peasants. Chen Zhaowan was originally a rogue. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as Chiang Kai-shek's acting division commander. During the "Communist Suppression" in Jiangxi, his entire army was wiped out, and he embezzled six months' worth of the entire division's military pay and fled back. He seized peasants' land and lent money at usurious rates, thus becoming a big despot landlord. During the period of enemy-puppet rule, he colluded with the enemy even more, exploited the masses, and committed all kinds of evil. At the meeting, the villages raised more than 160 opinions. Xue Guangtai, who was over sixty years old, pointed at Chen Zengqi and questioned, "I only had one mu and three fen of land, and I didn't want to sell it to you; you dug a large ditch five chi deep and five chi wide on the west side of the land, and the rain washed away my land. I couldn't plant it, so I had to reluctantly sell it to you, and you still gave me one hundred yuan less. You are really black-hearted!" The crowd shouted, "Down with the despots who harm the poor!" An old man walked out of the crowd and cursed, "Black Bear (Chen Zhaowan's nickname) is really lawless! When Mr. Fan went to teach, he saw that someone's daughter was good-looking, and he insisted on marrying her. Mr. Fan hid in Xishifoying, but he still caught up and bullied her." Zhang ×× from Zhangliuzhuang said, "My family borrowed 3,000 yuan from Chen Zengqi, and the interest was doubled, not to mention the interest on interest. In one year, all seventy mu of land ended up in his hands." An Baoquan from Chengyuan Village said, "I served as a soldier under Chen Zhaowan for more than a year. The entire division was paid more than 88,000 yuan each month. He embezzled six months' worth of pay. This tall building and large house are all built on soldiers' blood!" The crowd once again shouted excitedly, "Pay back debts!" "Return land to the home!" The struggle was victorious, and more than 300 mu of land and 26 large tile-roofed houses were immediately returned to the peasants.

　　联合斗倒大恶霸土地房屋归农民
    阳谷推进土地改革
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】阳谷土地改革运动正在开展。五区陈集等十余村联合斗倒大恶霸地主陈昭万等，三顷多地归还农民。陈昭万原是流氓出身，抗战前曾任蒋介石的代理师长，在江西“剿共”时全军覆灭，他贪污全师六个月的兵饷逃跑回来。侵夺农民土地，放高利贷，遂成大恶霸地主。敌伪统治时代更勾结敌人，鱼肉群众，无恶不作。大会上各村提出达一百六十余条意见，六十多岁的薛广泰指着陈增旗质问：“俺只有一亩三分地俺不卖给你；你在地西边掘了五尺深五尺宽的大沟，下雨冲了俺的地，俺没法种，不得不忍心卖给你，还少给俺一百块钱，你真是好黑心啊！”台下高呼“打倒恶霸坑害穷人！”人群里走出一个老头骂道：“黑狗熊（陈昭万的外号）可真是无法无天啦！范先生教学去了，他看见人家闺女长得好，硬要同人家结婚，范先生躲到西石佛营，他又赶上欺负人家。”张刘庄的张××说：“俺家借陈增旗三千元钱，对半的利息还不算利上加利，一年的光景，七十多亩地全弄在他手里去啦”。成圆村的安宝荃说：“我跟陈昭万当过一年多的兵，全师每个月发饷八万八千多元。他贪污了六个月的饷，这高楼大房都是喝的兵血！”台下又是一阵激昂的高呼声“欠债还账”，“土地还家”，斗争胜利了，三百余亩土地，二十六间大瓦屋，当即归还给农民。
