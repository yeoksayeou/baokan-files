　　The Soviet People's Impression of Mao Dun
　　Since Mr. Mao Dun arrived in the Soviet Union, Moscow Radio broadcast an article entitled "The Soviet People's Impression of Mao Dun" on the 28th of last month. The article said: Mao Dun, the great Chinese writer who just celebrated his 50th birthday this year, made his name in the Chinese literary world after writing the "Eclipse" trilogy ("Disillusionment," "Pursuit," and "Hesitation") in 1927. In 1935, a translated version of "Hesitation" was published in the Soviet Union. Soviet readers further recognized Mao Dun in 1936. In the Soviet Union, Mao Dun was already referred to as a revolutionary writer, and his translated works such as "Spring Silkworms," "Autumn Harvest," and "Midnight" were read. The novel "Midnight" received excellent reviews from Soviet critics. A review of the novel in a Soviet magazine said: "This novel shows the author as a thoughtful observer. 'Midnight' uses new artistic techniques to express all the noteworthy aspects of Chinese political, economic, and social life in the 1930s. It reveals the entire phenomenon of feudal capitalism under the knives of international imperialism. This novel depicts all the characteristics of that era and points out the political direction of that stage. After 1937, Mao Dun's long and short works continued to be translated into Russian and appeared in Soviet magazines. These works demonstrate Mao Dun's profound views on the literature of the national liberation war and his technical and theoretical strengths.

　　苏联人民对茅盾的印象
    茅盾先生到了苏联以后，莫斯科广播电台在上月二十八日发表了一篇《苏联人民对茅盾的印象》，文里边说：今年刚度过五十寿辰的中国大文豪茅盾，自从一九二七年写出《蚀》三部曲（《幻灭》、《追求》、《动摇》）以后，中国文坛上就出现了他的名字。一九三五年在苏联出版了《动摇》的译本，苏联的读者在一九三六年进一步认识了茅盾，在苏联已经称呼茅盾为革命作家，并且读到他的《春蚕》、《秋收》及《子夜》的译本。《子夜》这部小说，获得了苏联批评家极好的评语。苏联杂志上关于这部小说的评语说：“这部小说表现了作者是深思熟虑的观察家。《子夜》用新的艺术手腕，表现出一九三○年时期中国政治、经济、社会各方面的生活中一切值得注意的问题，它揭开了国际帝国主义屠刀下封建资本主义的全部现象。这部小说写出这一时代的一切特征，并指出那一阶段的政治方向。一九三七年以后，茅盾的长篇和短篇著作继续被译成俄文，并在苏联杂志上出现，作品中表现了茅盾对民族解放战争文学的深刻观点和他的技术与理论方面的特长。
