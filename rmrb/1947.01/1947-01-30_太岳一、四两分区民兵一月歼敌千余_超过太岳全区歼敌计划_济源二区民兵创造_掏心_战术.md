    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 29th dispatch] The Taiyue Military Commission last year called on: "To defend Chairman Mao, the entire region should strive to eliminate 800 enemies in December." Now, according to statistics from the First and Fourth Military Sub-districts alone, the original plan for the entire region has been exceeded by 50 percent (eliminating 1,240 enemies). Since proposing "Defend Chairman Mao" and coordinating with the Lüliang campaign, a groundbreaking enemy elimination movement has been launched from Pingyao and Jiexiu in the north to Wenxi, Xiaxian, Mengxian, and Jiyuan in the south, compressing the enemy into strongholds and attacking the enemy's heart. The spider-web joint defense of Fushan, the explosion hero Shang Qingfu of Hongtong, and the combat hero Ye Mingzhu of Yangcheng have all made significant contributions. There has been great progress in tactics, often achieving unexpected victories with no casualties. For example, in the ambush at Sanfen Town by the Shitan Village militia in Zhaocheng, 47 enemies were eliminated without any casualties on our side; in Pingyao, 130 enemies were eliminated in one month with only two minor injuries on our side; in Lingshi, 132 enemies were eliminated in one month with no casualties on our side. These brilliant achievements demonstrate that the tactics of the region's militia have made a leap forward in this enemy elimination movement.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 29th dispatch] The militia of the Second District of Jiyuan created the "heart-stabbing" tactic, penetrating deep into the enemy's heart and capturing alive the "counter-reckoning chief" Yan Fuwang and 24 others. The enemy stronghold of Longtai (under the jurisdiction of Mengxian) on the southeastern border of the district was garrisoned by two regular companies. The "counter-reckoning brigade" leader Yan Fuwang relied on this to live in the Qu Gou, Shenxiandong, Yuan Gou, and Liangliuzhuang areas behind Longtai. On the night of the 26th, the Second District militia, with lightning speed, raided Qu Gou, Yuan Gou, and Liangliuzhuang, capturing all 24 people, including "counter-reckoning brigade" leader Yan Fuwang. The enemy in Longtai was extremely panicked. To prevent the militia from "stabbing their hearts," they erected a large pole in front of the bunker and tied the people to it to "stand guard" for them. Still not feeling safe, they withdrew all the puppet militias from the surrounding strongholds of Fengzhuang and Songgouyao to Longtai.
    [Another dispatch] Since the militia of the Second District of Jiyuan implemented the "heart-stabbing" tactic, the anti-counter-reckoning struggle in the 13 administrative villages on the north bank of the river has been rapidly developed, and some villages have even entered the land reform stage. Counter-reckoning elements in Zhongwang, Suncun, and other places have returned to find the militia, saying, "Instead of waiting for people to come and arrest us, it is better to come back and plead for leniency and settle the matter." A counter-reckoning element in a certain village even brought back five cows to return to the masses.

    太岳一、四两分区民兵一月歼敌千余
    超过太岳全区歼敌计划
    济源二区民兵创造“掏心”战术
    【本报太岳二十九日电】太岳武委总会去年曾号召：“为保卫毛主席，全区争取在十二月份内歼敌八百。”现仅据一、四两个分区的统计，已超过全区原定计划百分之五十（歼敌一千二百四十名）。自提出“保卫毛主席”与配合吕梁作战后，北起平遥、介休，南迄闻喜、夏县及孟县、济源，掀起一个惊天动地的歼敌运动，把敌人压缩在据点里，并向敌人心脏出击。浮山蛛网联防、洪洞爆炸英雄尚清福、阳城战斗英雄夜明珠都有重大贡献，在战术上有了很大进步，往往出奇制胜，毫无伤亡。如赵城石滩村伏击三分镇，歼敌四十七名，我无一伤亡；平遥一个月内歼敌一百三十人，我仅轻伤二人；灵石一个月内歼敌一百三十二名，我毫无伤亡。此种辉煌战绩，说明全区民兵的战术，在此次歼敌运动中，已获得飞跃的进步。
    【本报太岳二十九日电】济源二区民兵创造“掏心”战术，深入敌人心脏，活捉“倒算大队长”阎福旺以下二十四人。该区东南边界之龙台（孟县属）敌据点，驻有两个正规连，“倒算大队”队长阎福旺倚此住在龙台后面的璩沟、神仙洞、元沟、两留庄一带。二十六日夜，二区民兵以神速动作奔袭璩沟、元沟、两留庄，将“倒算大队长”阎福旺以下二十四人全部擒获。龙台敌人恐慌异常，为防备民兵来“掏心”，在碉堡前竖起一支大杆，把老百姓拴在上面给他“放哨”，还不放心，把周围的封庄、宋沟窑等据点的伪民团全部撤回龙台。
    【又电】自济源二区民兵实行“掏心”战术后，河北岸十三个行政村的反倒算斗争乃得迅速开展，某些村子并已进入土地改革，中王、孙村等地倒算分子纷纷回来找民兵，他们说：“等人家来抓，还不如自己回来说情，把事情了结。”某村的倒算分子还拉了五个牛回来归还群众。
