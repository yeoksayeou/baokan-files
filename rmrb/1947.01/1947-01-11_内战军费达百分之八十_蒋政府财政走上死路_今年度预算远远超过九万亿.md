Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai Report: Observers, both Chinese and foreign, in Nanjing and Shanghai, believe that the budget announced by the Chiang government for this year is deceptive. They generally believe that the Chiang government is facing an unprecedented financial crisis. The Chiang government announced that the total expenditure for this year's budget is over 9 trillion yuan, and declared that military spending only accounts for slightly more than 40 percent of it. However, even Lin Wei, the Deputy Minister of National Defense, stated in a report to the Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council on the 4th of this month: "The total budget of the Ministry of National Defense has been approved at over 3.8 trillion yuan, but it is feared that it will be far from actual needs." (Central News Agency) The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Nanjing on the 4th, criticized Chiang government's Director of Budget, Xu Kan, for boasting that military spending had been "greatly reduced," stating: "However, observers, given the ongoing civil war and renewed conscription, doubt that these are merely paper reductions." The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Shanghai on the 4th, stated: "Observers in Shanghai all point out that 80 percent of the government's entire budget is still used for military spending, while that used for national recovery and rehabilitation is minimal, or even non-existent." The Associated Press stated: "A difficult year awaits China" (referring to the Chiang-controlled areas), especially in the economic field, which is a common opinion among observers. Until now, all measures used to curb the inflation that has ruined the economy have been unsuccessful. Moreover, it is generally acknowledged that all measures will be ineffective unless the differences between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are eliminated. Authoritative economic expert Ma Yinchu pointed out in a lecture that the actual final account for 1947 will reach 29 to 40 trillion yuan, which is a financial dead end.

　　内战军费达百分之八十
    蒋政府财政走上死路
  　今年度预算远远超过九万亿
    【新华社延安八日电】上海讯：京沪中外观察家对蒋政府所公布的今年度预算，认为是骗人的东西。咸信将政府正面临空前未有的财政危机。蒋政府公布的今年度预算总支出为九万余亿元，并公布军费仅占其中百分之四十强，但甚至国防部次长林蔚本月四日在参政会常驻会的报告中也说：“国防部总预算经核定为三万八千余亿元，但与实际需要恐相差甚巨”。（中央社）合众社在南京四日电中，批评蒋政府主计长徐堪自诩军费已“大大减低”时称：“但现观察家鉴于内战未停与再度征兵，对此均怀疑为纸上预算的裁减。”美联社则于上海四日电中称：“上海观察家均指出政府全部预算，仍是百分之八十用于军费，而用于国家之恢复及善后者，则微乎其微，甚或没有。”美联社称：“一个多难的年份，在等待着中国。”（指蒋管区），特别是在经济方面，这是观察家普遍的意见。直到现在，曾用以抑制使经济败坏的通货膨胀的一切办法，一无所成。而且一般承认：除非国共之间消除其分歧，所有的办法也将一律无效。权威经济专家马寅初氏，在一次讲演中，指出一九四七年决算实际将达二十九到四十万亿元，这是财政上的死路。
