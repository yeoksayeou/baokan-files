Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 11th that the second issue of the New Era magazine this year published an article by Avarin on the Chinese political situation, pointing out that the Kuomintang reactionaries are using continuous US aid to carry out a struggle against the people. It also stated: The social opinion of the United States, China, and other countries believes that the United States is interfering in China in political, economic, and military aspects. The "Sino-US Commercial Treaty" signed last November poses the danger of China returning to a state of enslavement for a hundred years. Avarin concluded that all attempts to suppress the Chinese people can only incite new struggles by the people and create a threat to international peace and security.

　　阿瓦林抨击美蒋合作奴役中国将引起人民新斗争
    【新华社延安十二日电】莫斯科十一日广播：本年新时代杂志第二期刊载阿瓦林论中国政治形势一文指出，国民党反动派利用美国不断的援助进行反对人民的斗争。并称：美国、中国以及其他各国的社会舆论，认为美国在政治经济与军事各方面对中国实行干涉，去年十一月所签订的“中美商约”，有使中国又退回到百年来被奴役的境地之危险。阿瓦林结论指出，镇压中国人民的一切企图，只能引起人民新的斗争，而且造成对国际和平与安全的威胁。
