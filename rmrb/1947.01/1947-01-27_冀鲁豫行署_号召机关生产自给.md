(This Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 25th Dispatch) In order to get everyone involved and overcome financial difficulties, the Administrative Office's financial and economic conference specifically decided to reorganize organ production and called on all organs to acknowledge their self-sufficiency tasks. The main points of the resolution are as follows: In recent years, organ production, under the principle of hands-on participation, has made significant contributions to financial subsidies and the improvement of organ life. In the future, organ production should focus on developing decentralized agricultural and industrial businesses, small handicrafts, and transportation industries. Commerce should adopt unified leadership and appropriate centralized management, strictly prohibiting commercial operations by individuals and small units. It is specifically stipulated that organ production personnel are not allowed to enjoy public grain and public funds, are not allowed to evade taxes and engage in smuggling, are not allowed to requisition civilian labor and animal power under any pretext, and are not allowed to misappropriate public funds. Finally, leading organs and responsible cadres should take the lead in acknowledging the self-sufficiency tasks of the organs or individuals.

    号召机关生产自给
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】为了大家动手，克服财经困难，行署财经会议特决定整理机关生产，并号召各机关自认自给任务，决议要点如下：几年来的机关生产在亲自动手的方针下，对财政的补助、机关生活的改善，有很大贡献。今后机关生产应着重发展分散经营的农工业及小手工业与运输业。商业应采取统一领导与适当的集中经营，严格取缔个人及小单位的商业经营。特别规定机关生产人员不准享受公粮公款待遇，不准逃税走私，不准借口征用民力畜力，不准挪用公款。最后领导机关与负责干部应带头自认机关的或个人的自给任务。
