Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th. The pilot program for land bonds in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has been successfully tested in Wangjia Village, Gaoying District, Qingyang County. The township purchased a total of more than 1,900 mu of landlord land, with the price of each mu being equivalent to one to one and a half years of harvest from that land. Initially, 68 landless households and 22 households with little land purchased it, with an average of 5 to 6 mu per person (2 mu of mountain land, equivalent to 1 mu of flat land). Landlords retained at least 9 mu of land per person, following the regulation of exceeding local middle peasants by 50%. The township originally had more than 9,000 mu of land and a population of more than 1,000. During rent reduction, in addition to 73 people obtaining more than 500 mu of land, there were still 457 landless and land-poor peasants. After this purchase, 97% of the land in the township was owned by peasants. At the celebration meeting, the peasants unanimously requested that the Wangjia (王家) in Wangjia Village, named after the big landlord Wang Yin, be renamed Nongjia (农家). The following methods were used in this work: (1) Conducting in-depth and detailed individual investigations, publicizing to them according to each person's specific situation. (2) Convening township meetings, democratic discussions, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses for purchasing land. (3) According to the actual situation, revising Article 11 of the "Draft Regulations on Land Purchase": The purchase should be based on the current cultivation, because basing it on current cultivation would only allow tenant farmers to obtain land, and it would be difficult for other poor and hired peasants to obtain land. Moreover, although the original tenant farmers hand over one-third of the cultivated land, they will no longer pay rent from now on. Calculating that half of their annual harvest has to be given to the landlord, their actual income has increased. Therefore, the original tenant farmers also agree to this amendment, so that poor and hired peasants can obtain land. (4) Destroying the old landlord contracts, establishing new purchase contracts, improving the village administration, and thoroughly doing the follow-up work. As a result, the result indeed achieved the mobilization of the broad masses, enabling all landless peasants to obtain land, without harming the basic interests of rich and middle peasants, taking care of the landlords, strengthening mass organizations, and improving village and township administration.

    陕甘宁庆阳县王家村
    取得试办土地公债经验
    【新华社延安二十八日电】陕甘宁边区试办土地公债，已在庆阳县高迎区王家村试验中获得成功。该乡共征购地主土地一千九百余亩，每亩地价为该地一年至年半之收获量，初由六十八户无地及廿二户少地农民所承购，平均每人得地五亩至六亩，（山地二亩，折平地一亩），地主每人留地至少九亩，遵照了超过当地中农百分之五十的规定。该乡原有土地九千余亩，人口一千余，在减租中除有七十三人得地五百余亩外，尚有无地少地农民四百五十七人，经此次征购后，该乡百分之九十七的土地，已为农民所有。在庆祝大会上，农民一致要求，将因大地主王银而得名之王家村之王家，改名为农家。此次工作中采用了如下的方法：（一）进行深入详尽个别的调查，按照每人具体情况，向其宣传。（二）召开乡民大会，民主讨论，发动群众征购土地的热情。（三）根据实况，修改“征购条例草案”之第十一条：承购以现耕为基础一点，因以现耕为基础，只能使佃户得地，其他贫雇农将很难得地，且原佃户虽拿出现耕地三分之一，但从此不交租，以其过去每年收获量之一半要交给地主来算，实际上收入是增加了，故原佃户对此修改亦同意，这样使贫雇农都能获得土地。（四）将地主老约毁弃，另立征购新约，并健全村政权，把善后工作做得彻底，因之结果确实达到了发动广大群众，使所有无地农民得到了土地，不损害富农、中农基本利益与照顾了地主，加强了群众组织与健全了村乡政权。
