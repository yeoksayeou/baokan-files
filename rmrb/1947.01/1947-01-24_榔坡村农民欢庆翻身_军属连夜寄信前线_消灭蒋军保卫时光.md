　　Farmers in Langpo Village Celebrate Emancipation
    Military Families Mail Letters to the Front Lines Overnight
    Eliminate Chiang's Troops and Defend the Good Times
    [Report from this newspaper's Licheng correspondent] After a month of investigation and rent reduction, the land reform in Langpo Village has been successfully completed. Emancipated farmers held a meeting on New Year's Day to celebrate their victory. Emancipation heroes Zhang Chongzhen and Zhang Xiaocheng thanked Chairman Mao for his wise leadership and prepared to organize large-scale production. More than 20 newly emancipated farmers, including Zhang Santun, voluntarily signed up to join the militia, saying, "The little Chiang in the village has been overthrown, but there is still the big Chiang who wants to seize our fruits. We must strengthen the people's armed forces to defend the fruits of our emancipation." More than a dozen military families, with the help of the masses, solved their difficulties and sent twelve letters to the front-line soldiers overnight, encouraging them to eliminate Chiang's troops and defend the good times. It is reported that after several rent reduction movements in Langpo Village, feudal landlords still cunningly hid a lot of land. After an in-depth leveling and replenishment movement, a total of 2.8 hectares of land, 16 houses, 11 head of livestock, more than 300 sheep, and 154 shi of grain were recovered. Twenty-one poor peasant households were promoted to middle peasant status, and 52 middle peasant households all received the fruits of their labor. Military families and more than ten outside hired peasant households received special care. Zhang Suocheng's military family of six received 300,000 yuan. The hired laborer Ma Heyou, who came from outside the village, received 150,000 yuan. Zhang Pinxian and his brother herded sheep for the landlord for 30 years. After this emancipation, they had houses and land and were promoted to wealthy middle peasants. They have now changed their profession and are working hard on their own land.
