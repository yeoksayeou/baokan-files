　　Two Worlds
    [Report from Taiyue by Our Newspaper on the 16th] "When the Chiang troops come, they seize grain; when the Eighth Route Army comes, they distribute grain. It's truly two different worlds." This is the personal experience of the masses before and after the liberation of Yicheng. During the battle to liberate Yicheng, the Eighth Route Army seized over 10,000 shi of grain that Chiang's troops had looted from the masses and immediately handed it over to the democratic government to be returned to the people. In recent days, the masses have been flocking to the warehouses in the city to collect grain. Ma Wangyue's child from Weicun carried seven jin of corn from the city and said happily, "When the Chiang troops come, they seize grain; when the Eighth Route Army comes, they distribute grain. It's truly two different worlds." An old lady standing next to him interjected, "The first time the Chiang troops came, they snatched twenty jin of millet from me and even took my daughter-in-law. In four months, they snatched a hundred jin of millet, scaring and beating us, not a single day of peace." As she spoke, she began to cry sadly. In areas occupied by Chiang's troops, the people are unable to maintain their livelihoods. In Beiding Village alone, in the four months of occupation, they provided over 16,000 shi of grain, over 77,000 chi of cloth, and over 630,000 yuan. Other expenses, such as horse feed, gun purchases, wheat fees, cotton fees, and New Year's fees, are countless. In total, the burden on the village from Chiang's troops in four months exceeded twenty times the annual burden under the democratic government.

　　两个天地
    【本报太岳十六日电】“蒋军来了抢粮，八路来了放粮，真是两个天地。”这是翼城光复前后群众亲身的体验。在光复翼城战斗中，八路军缴获蒋军抢夺群众之粮食一万余石，随即交给民主政府发还群众。连日群众纷纷前往城内仓库领粮，卫村马望月的孩子从城内扛了七斤玉米，高兴的说：“蒋军来了抢粮，八路来了放粮，真是两个天地。”站在旁边的老太太插嘴说：“蒋军第一次来，抢了我二十斤小米，还将我媳妇抢走了。四个月来抢去小米一百斤，吓呀，打呀，没有一天说安宁。”说着便伤心的哭起来。蒋军侵占地区，人民已无法维持生活，仅北丁村在被侵占四个月中，共出粮款小麦一万六千余石，布七万七千余尺，款六十三万余元，其他马料费、买枪费、麦费、棉花费、过年费无算，综计该村四个月中，给蒋军负担超过民主政府全年负担的二十倍。
