The establishment of the "Serving the People" column in your newspaper has greatly pleased me, as it allows various difficult questions to be answered. However, I have a small suggestion regarding the "Small Methods" column. The January 19th issue featured "How to Make Fire," which is very useful for saving resources. However, it did not explain the underlying principles, leaving people knowing what to do, but not why. For example, what is the principle behind rubbing a match against a pig bone? Is it correct? Please reply.

Answer:
The suggestion is very good and we should follow it in the future. However, due to limited space, we cannot be very detailed. The reason why a pig bone can be used to strike a match is that pig bones contain phosphorus. After burning, the gelatinous substance turns into charcoal, and the phosphorus is exposed. This has roughly the same properties as the coating on a safety matchbox, so it can be struck.

### “小办法”要讲清道理

    “小办法”要讲清道理
    贵报建立了“人民服务”栏，我经过它，各种疑难问题可以得到解答，我很高兴。但对“小办法”一栏有点小意见，十九日该栏载“怎样取火”，在节约方面很有作用，不过没有把道理介绍出来，使人知其然，不知其所以然，如猪骨头擦火柴，到底是什么道理呢？是否对？请复。
          读者李启艳
    答
    所提意见很好，今后应照着作，不过因篇幅有限，不能很详尽。猪骨头擦火柴，是猪骨头里含有磷质，经燃烧后，胶质成炭，磷质显露，就和保险火柴盒上的涂药有大体相同的性质，所以能擦着。
