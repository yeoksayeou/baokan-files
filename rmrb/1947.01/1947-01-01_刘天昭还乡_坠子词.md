　　Liu Tianzhao Returns Home
    Zhui Zi Ballad
    Han Ming
　　The civil war's cannons roar incessantly,
　　The people in the Jiang-occupied areas suffer immense devastation.
　　The Central Army enters villages with blood-stained faces,
        Raping, killing, and burning with inhumane cruelty.
　　They are no different from the Japanese or traitors,
        The only difference is they are American-brand traitors.
　　Wang Jingwei was a running dog of the Japanese,
        Chiang Kai-shek has become an American son.
　　Advise compatriots not to have illusions about Chiang Kai-shek,
        You'll know the trouble when the calamity troops reach your home.
　　Regardless of rich or poor, all suffer devastation,
        They don't distinguish between landlord, farmer, or member.
　　There's a true story in Nanhua County,
        Let me introduce it to you, listen carefully.
　　Xiao Liu Ji is directly connected to the Juan-He highway,
        Located in Nanhua County, close to the east.
　　In this market town, there is a fugitive landlord,
        His name is Liu Tianzhao, fleeing from his crimes.
　　He has an eldest son, Liu Xueyao,
        The father and son are both members of the "Home Return Corps."
　　At home, they left behind a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law,
        And a daughter at home.
　　The daughter is eighteen or nineteen,
        The daughter-in-law is only twenty-three.
　　There is also a young boy, Liu Erpang,
        Fourteen or fifteen years old, in his youth.
　　Tianzhao's wife is a woman of the Xing family,
        Her age is forty-three.
　　He has 120 mu of good land,
        His oppression of the poor is a heinous crime.
　　Although the peasant association struggled against him,
        The handling of him was relatively lenient.
　　He was left with twenty mu of good land,
        And a fine manor house.
　　The whole family should be grateful,
        But they shouldn't have joined the "Home Return Corps."
　　He won't give up until he sees the Yellow River,
        His heart won't be content until his home is harmed.
　　The Central Army occupied Heze,
        The masses in Xiao Liu are not at peace.
　　The whole village held a mobilization meeting,
        Clearing the houses to defend against traitors.
　　Young men and women should hide,
        It's no fun when the Jiang troops arrive.
　　Cao County conscripted countless soldiers,
        Many women were gang-raped.
　　Everyone was very scared when they heard this,
        Only Xing was very happy.
　　Others all fled but she didn't leave,
        Everyone tried to persuade her.
　　"Tell your children to hide!
        Haven't you heard the news from the refugees in the south!?"
　　Xing spoke pompously,
        Spouting nonsense to the peasant association:
　　"Listen to the planes dropping bombs,
        Listen to the cannons roaring.
　　This war is for me,
        For my whole family to turn things around.
　　Whoever is in the peasant association is guilty,
        My time is at hand.
　　When my husband comes home,
        The whole family can live in peace.
　　He and his father are both in the Home Return Corps,
        Officials protect each other, there are connections.
　　I'm not afraid when the Central Government arrives,
        I see things changing immediately."
　　This speech angered Little Liu Tong,
        Stopped Xing and questioned her.
　　"Don't think so highly of yourself,
        When the time comes, you'll be in trouble.
　　The Home Return Corps can't control the regular army,
        They'll sweep clean when they enter the village.
　　They'll take all your things,"
　　Xing said, "I'm willing to give up some things."
　　Liu Tong said, "They'll eat all your chickens,"
        Xing said, "How much are chickens worth?"
　　Liu Tong said, "They'll take away your oxen and donkeys,"
        Xing said, "What does it matter if they take away a mule?"
　　Liu Tong said, "They'll grab your second son to be a soldier,"
        Xing said, "I'll risk him being in the Home Return Corps for a few days."
　　Liu Tong said, "They'll drag your daughter and daughter-in-law and sleep with them,"
        One sentence made Xing look up to the sky,
　　Although she didn't say it out loud,
        She thought in her heart that being a mistress would be respectable.
　　This was what Xing thought in her heart,
        But she didn't say it aloud.
　　She became enraged and cursed:
        "Damn Liu Tong, talking nonsense.
　　When your older brother comes home,
        He'll kill your dog head to avenge me!"
　　While the two of them were arguing,
        Machine guns and cannons were firing happily.
　　All the villagers fled,
        Only Liu Tianzhao's family stayed at home.
　　Mother and daughter-in-law were waiting for their husbands,
        The whole family to reunite.
　　Who would have thought that the "Home Return Corps" had no courage,
        The army was in front, they were behind.
　　The 55th Army entered Xiao Liu,
        Running wildly through the streets and alleys.
　　Searching every box and cabinet for the Eighth Route Army,
        All the belongings were looted.
　　Some people didn't escape,
        They were driven into a courtyard.
　　Forcing them to dig fortifications,
        Carrying door panels and bricks.
　　Chickens squawked loudly in the streets,
        Slaughtering pigs and sheep, making a ruckus.
　　Anyone who disobeyed was shot with a gun.
        Women were raped upon sight.
　　The market's goods were all looted,
        Stealing wine and money.
　　We won't talk about the suffering of the whole market,
        Just about Xing's family at home.
　　When she saw the army arrive at the market,
        The whole family smiled happily.
　　Daughter and daughter-in-law quickly boil water,
        Second son, quickly go get cigarettes.
　　Soon the army arrived at her home,
        Xing greeted them and spoke.
　　"Respected commanders, you've all come,
        I've been waiting for you until my eyes were dry.
　　My son is in the Home Return Corps,
        His father is also in the "Home Return Corps."
　　One family doesn't speak two words,
        Quickly drink water, quickly smoke cigarettes."
　　The commanders were very pleased to hear these words,
        They felt very comfortable in their hearts.
　　No wonder the old woman is so good,
        Her people are in the "Home Return Corps."
　　Looking into the kitchen doorway,
        Inside were two young women.
　　The daughter is only eighteen or nineteen,
        The daughter-in-law is twenty-two or three.
　　The commanders were increasingly attracted,
        Evil desires arose, and they plotted maliciously.
　　The squad leader was a lecher,
        A clever plan arose and his face changed.
　　He shouted at the old woman,
        "Don't try to fool me with words.
　　I heard your son is in the Eighth Route Army,
        How can there be a "Home Return Corps" in your house?"
　　Saying that, he entered the main room,
        Searching every box and cabinet chaotically.
        Turning over every room,
        Stealing everything valuable.
        Xing saw things were not going well,
        These commanders don't recognize us.
        She quickly told her daughter and daughter-in-law to escape!
        It will be bad if you wait any longer.
    The daughter and daughter-in-law were just about to leave,
        When they were stopped together.
    The squad leader grabbed her daughter,
        And locked the door inside the upper room,
    One grabbed his daughter-in-law;
        Pulled her into the east room to rape her.
    The rest surrounded the old woman,
        Grabbing Xing and rummaging through her.
    This one said, "Quickly buy me some eggs";
        That one said, "Quickly buy me foreign cigarettes".
    Xing was in a difficult position,
        Hearing screams of agony inside the rooms.
    Xing was forced to go outside,
        Seeing Second Son returning with cigarettes.
    Xing took the cigarettes with a heavy heart,
        So angry that she fell to the ground.
    Second Son didn't know what was going on,
        He could only go home to see.
    As soon as he entered the second gate, he heard:
        Loud noises in both rooms.
    The soldiers were shouting happily,
        Hearing his sister crying.
    This one said: "Squad leader, come out quickly and let me switch,"
        That one said "Everyone has to have some fun".
    Second Son heard that things were not good,
        He turned around and went back to the front door.
    Seeing his mother pouting,
        His heart was filled with sorrow.
    Hearing the argument and gang rape at home,
        Who can save this good situation?
    Things didn't go well,
        Liu Tianzhao followed his eldest son home.
    He knew that the army had arrived at the market,
        The father and son wanted to go home and see.
    Stepping out of Heze with steady steps,
        Unconsciously arriving at the front door.
    Seeing his wife pouting,
        Second Son lowered his head, tears streaming down.
    Not knowing what was going on in his heart,
        He could only step forward and ask.
    "The army has come to our door,
        Why aren't you and Second Son happy?"
    Xing saw her husband arrive,
        Anxious and angry, she spoke,
    "Speaking of your good army,
        Now there's a whole squad in our house.
    They've looted everything clean,
        Wanting eggs and cigarettes.
    I wouldn't mind anything,
        The most hateful thing is that our daughter and daughter-in-law are being gang-raped.
    Hurry home and take a look,
        You don't know how miserable our daughter is crying."
    Liu Tianzhao's eyes widened when he heard this,
        His eldest son was also speechless.
    The father and son stared blankly for a long time,
        Feeling that this matter was very shameful.
    If they go home and ask,
        They're still afraid that the army won't recognize the "Home Return Corps."
    If they don't ask about this matter,
        Their daughter and daughter-in-law are being gang-raped.
    Xing urged, "Hurry up and go,
        You don't know how much the children are suffering.
    One or two would be bearable,
        How can the children endure so many people?"
    Liu Tianzhao was in a difficult position,
        His eldest son was filled with anger.
    He roared "I'm going,
        How can it be over if they bully my family?!"
    Rushing to go home,
        It seemed like chaos was about to erupt.
    Stop the strings and rest the clapper,
        Let's end the story here.

　　刘天昭还乡
    坠子词
    韩明
    内战的炮火响连天，
    蒋占区老百姓受尽摧残。
    中央军进村庄血腥满面，
        又奸淫又烧杀惨绝人寰。
    比日本比汉奸没啥分辨，
        有分别只不过美牌汉奸。
    汪精卫当的是日本走狗，
        蒋介石已做了美国儿男。
    劝同胞对老蒋不要梦想，
        遭殃军到你家你就知端。
    也不管穷和富齐受摧残，
        那分你是地主、农民会员。
    南华县有一桩真情实事，
        给大家作介绍细听一番。
    小留集直串着鄄荷公路，
        只处在南华县紧靠东边。
    这集上有一个逃亡地主，
        他名叫刘天昭惧罪逃窜。
    他有个大儿刘学尧，
        爷俩都是“还乡团”。
    家中撇下婆媳俩，
        还有闺女在家园。
    闺女年长十八九，
        媳妇不过二十三。
    还有个二小刘二胖，
        十四五岁正青年。
    天昭的老婆邢氏女，
        年纪到有四十三。
    好地他有一顷二，
        压迫穷人罪滔天。
    虽然农会把他斗，
        对他处理倒算宽。
    好地留下二十亩，
        还留一所好庄院。
    全家应当来感谢，
        不该去当“还乡团”。
    人不见黄河心不死，
        家不被害心不甘。
    中央军把荷泽占，
        小留群众不得安。
    全村开了个动员会，
        空室清野防汉奸。
    青年男女要躲避，
        蒋军来了不好玩。
    曹县抓兵无其数，
        许多妇女被轮奸。
    大家听了很害怕，
        惟有邢氏很喜欢。
    人家都逃他不走，
        大家把他劝一番。
    “叫你家小孩躲躲吧！
       你没听南边逃难的把信传！？”
    邢氏说着洋气话，
        就向农会瞎胡言：
    “听这飞机丢炸弹，
        听这大炮响连天。
    这打仗就是为的俺，
        为的俺全家把身翻。
    谁在农会才有罪，
        俺的天下在眼前。
    俺小他爹回家转，
        全家可过太平年。
    他爷俩都在还乡队，
        官官相护有牵连。
    中央来了俺不怕，
        我看着马上就变天。”
    一片话说恼了小刘筒，
        拦住邢氏问一番。
    “你别想的这么好，
        到时候就叫你作了难。
    还乡团管不了正规军，
        进村就是一扫干。
    把你的东西都拿净”，
    邢氏说：“拿点东西我情愿。”
    刘筒说“把你的小鸡都吃净”，
        邢氏说“小鸡能值几个钱。”
    刘筒说“把你的犍牛叫驴都牵走”，
        邢氏说“牵走个骡子啥相干”。
    刘筒说“抓你二小当兵去，”
        邢氏说“拚上当几天还乡团”。
    刘筒说“拉你的闺女媳妇搂着睡”，
        一句话说的邢氏眼朝天，
    她虽然没有说出口，
        心里说当个太太也体面。
    这本是邢氏心里话，
        并没有说出唇外边。
    她恼羞成怒破口骂：
        “该死的刘筒瞎胡言。
    等你大哥回家转，
        杀你的狗头报仇冤！”
    他二人正在胡吵闹，
        机枪大炮响的欢。
    全村群众都逃走，
        刘天昭全家在家院。
    娘俩都把丈夫盼，
        全家回来好团圆。
    谁料想“还乡团”本没有胆，
        军队在前他在后边。
    五十五军把小留进，
        大街小巷胡乱窜。
    翻箱倒柜找八路，
        所有的东西都抢干。
    有一些群众没跑掉，
        被他们赶到一个院。
    逼着给他们挖工事，
        又搬门板又搬砖。
    满街上打的小鸡吱吱叫，
        杀猪宰羊闹翻天。
    谁不顺眼用枪打。
        见了妇女就强奸。
    集上的买卖也抢净，
        又抢酒来又抢钱。
    全集上受害咱不表，
        单表邢氏在家院。
    她见军队到集上，
        一家大小笑连天。
    闺女媳妇快烧水，
        二小赶快去拿烟。
    一会军队到他家，
        邢氏迎接把话谈。
    “各位老总都来了，
       盼你们盼的眼睛干。
    俺儿当着还乡队，
       他爹也当“还乡团”。
    一家人不说两家话，
        快喝水来快吸烟。”
    众老总一听这些话，
        心坎眼里很舒坦。
    怪不得老婆这么好，
        她的人当着“还乡团。”
    厨房门口往里看，
        里边有两个女少年。
    闺女不过十八九，
        媳妇二十有二三。
    众老总越看越对眼，
        兽性大发歹心按。
    班长本是好色鬼，
        心生巧计把脸翻。
    一声喝住老婆婆，
        “不要拿话来哄俺。
    听说你儿在八路，
        家里那有“还乡团”？
    说着就把上房进，
        翻箱倒柜胡乱翻。
        各个屋里翻一遍，
        细的东西抢个干。
        邢氏一见事不巧，
    这些老总不认咱。
        忙吩咐闺女媳妇逃走吧！
        再等一会不好玩。
    闺女媳妇才要走，
        一齐上前把她拦。
    班长拉住她闺女，
        上房以内把门关，
    一个拉住他媳妇；
        拉进东房去强奸。
    剩下的围住老婆婆，
        拉住邢氏胡乱翻。
    这个说“赶快给我买鸡子”；
        那个说“赶快给我买洋烟”。
    邢氏正在为难处，
        听屋里哟哟哟惨叫唤。
    邢氏被迫出门外，
        见二小拿烟转回还。
    邢氏接烟心头脑，
        气的倒在地平川。
    二小不知怎回事，
        只得到家去看看。
    一进二门就听见：
        两个屋里闹的欢。
    当兵的高兴得嗷嗷叫，
        听着他姐姐哭连天。
    这个说：“班长出来快换我，”
        那个说“大家都得欢一欢”。
    二小一听事不好，
        脚尖一磨回门前。
    见他母亲撅着嘴，
        自己一阵心里酸。
    听家中争夺轮奸嚷成一片，
        是谁能救救这个好局面。
    事不凑巧没有趣，
        刘天昭跟着大儿回家园。
    他知道军队到集上，
        爷俩回家要看看。
    出荷泽迈着四方步，
        不觉来到大门前。
    看见老婆橛着嘴，
        二小低头泪连连。
    心中不知怎么回事，
        只得上前问一番。
    “军队来到咱门上，
        你娘俩为啥不喜欢？”
    邢氏一见丈夫到，
        又急又恼把话言，
    “提起你那好军队，
        现在咱家整一班。
    东西抢个干干净，
        又要鸡子又要烟。
    要啥东西都不恼，
        最可恨闺女媳妇被轮奸。
    你赶快回家看一看，
        咱闺女哭的真可怜。”
    刘天昭一听瞪了眼，
        他的大儿也无话言。
    爷俩瞪了大半晌，
        觉着这事怪丢脸。
    再说到家问一问，
        还恐怕军队不认“还乡团”。
    再说不问这件事，
        闺女媳妇被轮奸。
    邢氏催着“快去吧，
        孩子的痛苦你不知端。
    一个两个还可在，
        那多人孩子怎么缠？”
    刘天昭处在两难地，
        他大儿一阵怒冲天。
    吼的一声“我要去，
        欺负我家怎算完？！”
    抢步要到家中去，
        眼看就是乱子山。
    提住弦子歇歇板，
        这回书说到这里就算完。
