    Strive for Complete Realization of "Land to the Tiller"
    Qinyuan Vigorously Carries Out
    Checking Feudalism and Mending Leaks
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 5th dispatch] Qinyuan County, which wrote a glorious chapter in the history of the War of Resistance with its siege defense, proposed a "letting go" policy in December after the county seat was recovered in April and May of 1945. The mass movement quickly, vigorously, and extensively deepened, making its land reform the most complete in the entire region. Currently, except for four administrative villages that are not yet thorough, the remaining areas, accounting for over 95% of the county, have achieved "land to the tiller," and 85% of the county's peasants have obtained land. One hundred and fifteen natural villages have completely realized "land to the tiller," accounting for over 70% of the villages in the county that have realized "land to the tiller." In these types of villages, feudal oppression and exploitation and extreme poverty have been eliminated, with only individual poor peasant households remaining. The masses' awareness has been greatly improved. Various organizations are sound, and the work is good. However, there are still some internal problems among the peasants in some villages that need to be resolved. Secondly, there are approximately forty natural villages that have largely realized "land to the tiller," accounting for about 19% of the villages in the county that have realized "land to the tiller." The characteristic of this type of village is that feudal forces still have small remnants, cadres are detached from the masses, and the masses' awareness is not high enough. Furthermore, the county has four administrative villages, which are border areas or newly recovered areas. In this type of village, the masses have undergone a mobilization, but it was not thorough and needs to be continued. In addition, some villages in remote mountainous areas, due to natural conditions and other limitations, although feudal exploitation has been eliminated and they have also turned themselves over, there are still extremely poor peasants due to the scarcity of land. These villages should strengthen leadership in production or find ways to adjust. The county has determined its future policy: to launch a large-scale "turning over" inspection movement, implement "checking feudalism and mending leaks," improve the masses' ideological awareness, thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants, and completely realize "land to the tiller."

    争取完全实现耕者有其田
    沁源大力进行
    查封建补窟窿
    【本报太岳五日电】抗战史上写下光辉围城斗争之沁源县，四五年四月县城收复后，十二月提出了放手方针，群运即迅速猛烈普遍深入的展开，完成土地改革的程度，为全区之冠。目前除四个行政村还不彻底外，其余占全县百分之九十五以上的地区，已实现了耕者有其田，全县百分之八十五的农民获得了土地。完全实现了耕者有其田的村子，已有一百一十五个自然村，约占全县实现耕者有其田的村庄百分之七十强，在这样类型的村子里，封建压迫与剥削与赤贫已经消灭，贫农仅存个别户，群众觉悟大大提高。各种组织健全，工作也好。不过还有部分村子，还存在一些农民的内部问题需解决。其次大体上实现耕者有其田的村子，计有四十个自然村，约占全县实现耕者有其田的村子百分之十九。这种类型村子的特点，是封建势力还留有小的尾巴，干部存在脱离群众的情形，群众觉悟也还不够。再次全县有四个行政村，系边沿区或新收复区，这种类型的村子里，群众也经过一次发动，但不彻底，仍须继续发动。此外有些山野外庄，因自然条件等限制，虽然消灭了封建剥削，也翻了身，但因土地少还有赤贫农存在，这些村加紧领导生产或设法调剂。该县确定今后方针，开展翻身大检查运动，实行“查封建补窟窿”，提高群众思想觉悟，彻底消灭封建尾巴”完全实现耕者有其田。
