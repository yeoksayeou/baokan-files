　　Chiang Area Flooded with American Goods, Liberated Area Thriving
  　Welcome National Industrial Capitalists to Invest and Operate in the Liberated Area:
  　Interview with Liu Daifeng, Director of the Border Region Trade Bureau
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Figures from all walks of life in Tianjin and Shanghai in the Chiang-controlled areas have proposed boycotting American goods, and industrial and commercial figures here have expressed great sympathy. Liu Daifeng, Director of the Border Region Trade Bureau, stated: American goods are flooding all parts of the Chiang-controlled areas, and our national industries are collapsing one after another. The domestic goods market is sluggish and depressed. Except for the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen, everyone else is crying out in misery, having reached an extremely difficult situation. On the other hand, our liberated area market is free from the monopoly and manipulation of bureaucratic comprador capital and is not bound by treasonous treaties. American goods cannot be smuggled in. Our democratic government is sparing no effort to support industry and commerce. Especially after the land reform, the purchasing power of farmers has greatly increased. All factories, workshops, and household sideline industries, the domestic and local goods markets, are thriving and enjoying tenfold profits. We hope that national industrial capitalists in the Chiang-controlled areas, if they cannot operate industries and businesses in the Chiang-controlled areas permeated with American goods (disaster), are welcome to invest and operate in the liberated areas. We will provide all conveniences and protections.

　　蒋区美货泛滥解放区百业繁荣
  　欢迎民族工业资本家到解放区来投资经营
  　边区贸易总局长刘岱峰谈话
    【本报特讯】蒋管区津、沪各界人士，提出抵制美货，此间工商界人士，咸寄与极大同情。边区贸易总局长刘岱峰氏称：美货泛滥蒋管区各地，我民族工业纷纷倒闭，国货市场冷落萧条；除蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族外，均叫苦连天，已到极端困难的境地。反观我解放区市场，既无官僚买办资本垄断操纵，又不受卖国条约束缚，美货不能走私进来。我民主政府扶植工商业更不遗余力。特别是经过土地改革，农民购买力大大提高，凡属工厂、作坊、家庭副业，国货、土货市场，均欣欣向荣，利市百倍。希望蒋管区各民族工业资本家，如果不能在美货（祸）弥漫的蒋管区经营工商业，欢迎来解放区投资经营。我们将给予一切便利及保护。
