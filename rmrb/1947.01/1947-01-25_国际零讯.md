    TASS, Montevideo, 19th. Recent attacks on Republicans in Franco's Spain have aroused a wave of anger among all democratic groups in Uruguay. Progressive newspapers declare that this government exists and is able to continue its crimes "only because of the protection of imperialist diplomacy, which allows Franco to escape any direct sanctions." The newspapers indignantly condemn these new acts of terror by Franco and firmly advocate severing relations with the Franco government.
