    Chiang's Army's Northward Corridor Is Increasingly Narrow
    Its Rear Is Under Severe Threat From Us
    [Report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, January 19th] Xinhua News Agency special correspondent Li Pu commented on the current situation on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield, stating: In the past half-month, General Liu Bocheng's troops have launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the southwestern Shandong area occupied by Chiang's army. Following the recovery of Juye and Jiaxiang, they also recovered Chengwu County seat in a two-hour battle on the evening of the 16th, which is only over 60 kilometers from the Longhai Railway. Chiang's army's northward corridor is therefore increasingly narrow. The Chiang's army, which is advancing north along the east side of the Pinghan Railway, is still stopped at Daming County seat. Its repeated delays and extensions of the plan to open up the Pinghan Railway by the end of the lunar year have once again been completely shattered, and it is now in a dilemma of advancing or retreating. Qiu Qingquan's Fifth Army occupied Nanle, an empty city south of Daming, the day before yesterday. This kind of pretentious calmness will eventually lead to a big mistake. The weak defense of the Longhai Railway has become an open secret. General Liu Bocheng's troops have been fighting in the eight counties of Liaocheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Jinxiang, Yutai, Dingtao, Heze, and Chengwu in the past half month, with overwhelming momentum, and have successively annihilated about 25,000 Chiang's troops in six groups. These Chiang's troops were pieced together from Xuzhou, Shangqiu, and other places along the Longhai Railway. Their command was chaotic, and their morale was low. They generally collapsed at the first touch. Cities such as Heze and Dingtao are the rear of the Chiang's army advancing north, and are now under severe threat.

　　新华社记者评冀鲁豫战场形势
    蒋军北进走廊日益狭隘
    其后方已受我严重威胁
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十九日电】新华社特派记者李普评论冀鲁豫战场之现势称：半月来刘伯承将军所部大举反攻蒋军侵占之鲁西南地区，继收复钜野、嘉祥之后，又于十六日晚以两小时之战斗收复城武县城，距陇海路仅六十余公里。蒋军之北进走廊因此日益狭隘，沿平汉东侧北犯蒋军现仍止于大名县城，其一再迁延展期至旧历年底打通平汉线之幻想又一次完全破灭，现已陷于进退两难之局。邱清泉之第五军于前日侵占大名以南之南乐空城，此种故作镇静之举动，终将铸成大错。陇海路守备薄弱已成公开之秘密，刘伯承将军所部半月来转战于聊城、钜野、嘉祥、金乡、鱼台、定陶、荷泽、城武等八县地区，势如破竹，先后歼灭蒋军六股约二万五千人。此等蒋军系从陇海路徐州商邱等地七并八凑而来，指挥紊乱斗志涣散，大抵一触即溃。荷泽定陶等城为北犯蒋军之后路，现已处于严重威胁之中。
