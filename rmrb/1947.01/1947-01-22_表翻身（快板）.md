Title: The Table Turns (Clapper Talk)

My name is Ma Chunwang, thirty-three this year,
A poor wretch for half my life:
Father died at eight, mother gone to heaven at ten.
Wandering east, wandering west,
No food, no clothes, going everywhere to "beg."
Sneaking around the doors of the wealthy, scurrying to the doors of the poor.
The poor have nothing to give;
The wealthy, dogs bite, the master rolls his eyes,
Curses harshly, shouts loudly,
Spittle nearly blinds my eyes.
Once, I scurried to the door of a rich man,
From inside the door, two dogs were released,
Pinning me down, legs kicking in the air,
Tearing my clothes to shreds, tearing off flesh,
The rich man laughed heartily on the sidelines…
At twelve, I herded sheep for Wang Guai's family.
Busy from dawn till dusk.
East mountain walk, west mountain turn,
Barefoot without shoes.
Thorns pierced the soles of my feet,
Stones bruised my toes.
Hungry stomach, dry mouth,
Wearing a single layer in the dead of winter.
North wind piercing skin and flesh,
My whole body shivering.
The sheep were fed fat and plump,
The master insisted they were thin and dry.
Always beaten or cursed,
Often denied meals,
One day, the master said the sheep hadn’t eaten enough,
I said: Look at their round bellies.
The bastard got angry when he heard,
A slap swelled half my face.

At eighteen, I became a hired hand,
Spent fifteen years at Master Ma's house.
Fifteen years, five thousand four hundred days,
Laboring before the stars fell,
Returning only when the stars appeared.
Working in the fields during the day,
At night, feeding donkeys and horses, unable to sleep.
Breaking my back from exhaustion,
Sweat pouring from my body.
The grain harvested piled high like earth,
The cotton picked like snowy mountains.
The master ate thick porridge, I drank thin soup,
The master wore cotton, I wore a single layer.
Every year-end wages were shorted,
Saying the shortage would be made up together next year,
The shopkeeper wouldn’t cheat his partners,
Shorting you and giving you interest,
Year after year dragging on,
In the end, five years of wages were shorted and not given to me.
Asking him for it, he turned his face,
Instead saying I was crazy from poverty, slandering him for being blind.

Thinking of the past, it truly breaks my heart.
Thanks to the Communist Party,
In the autumn, they led me to turn myself over.
Years of hatred, all turned over,
I went from house to house to make connections,
I told of my suffering, aired my grievances,
Calculated blood debts, returned cash on the spot.
Also distributed five mu and two fen of good land,
Three whole snow-tiled houses,
One yellow ox, one sheep,
One shi and five dou of wheat, eight shi and three dou of millet,
Also tables and cabinets,
New single clothes and cotton clothes…

In September, the chrysanthemums are fresh,
I happily and prosperously settled my home.
Free love to find a partner,
Married a wife named Ma Xiujuan,
Skillful hands and feet, good at labor,
Her cultural level is also better than mine.
The two of us, happy in our hearts,
Working together to farm and spin cotton.

The October sun is warm,
The democratic election is bustling.
My wife was elected to the Women's Rescue Association,
I was elected as the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association.
No worries about food and clothing, having a family,
And becoming a cadre, standing before the people.
A pot of flowers rises on the East Coast,
The flowers fall into our courtyard,
Chairman Mao's kindness is greater than the sky,
I will listen to his words for all my life,
He says defend ourselves, I will go to war,
He says produce, I will work hard,
Defeat old Chiang and do a good job in production,
Our days of liberation will be long-lasting.

　　表翻身（快板）
    梅村
    俺名马春旺，今年三十三，
    当了半辈子穷光蛋：
    八岁殁了爹，十岁娘归天。
    东流浪，西流浪，
    没吃没穿为了“要饭”到处窜。
    大户门上溜，小户门上串。
    小户没啥要；
    大户，狗咬，主人白眼翻，
    恶声骂，大声喊，
    唾沫星子淹瞎了俺的眼。
    有一次，财主门上串，
    门里放出两条狗，
    把俺按倒腿朝天，
    撕碎了衣裳，撕掉了肉，
    财主在一旁哈哈笑的欢……。
    十二岁，给王拐子家把羊拦。
    一天到晚不得闲。
    东山走，西山转，
    光着脚板没鞋穿。
    圪针扎破了脚底板，
    石头碰烂了脚指尖。
    肚子饥，口里干，
    十冬腊月穿单衫。
    北风钻进皮肉里，
    全身上下打颤颤。
    羊儿喂的肥又胖，
    主家硬说瘦成干。
    不是打来就是骂，
    时常不准把饭餐，
    有一天，主人说羊没吃饱，
    俺说：你看肚子圆。
    狗日一听发了火，
    一巴掌打肿俺脸半边。
　
    十八岁，当长工，
    马二爷家渡过了十五年。
    十五年，五千四百天，
    星星没落就劳动，
    星星出来才回还。
    白天地里把活做，
    到夜里，喂驴喂马不得眠。
    累断了脊梁骨，
    身上汗流干。
    打下的粮食多似土，
    摘下的棉花如雪山。
    主家吃稠俺喝汤，
    主家穿棉俺穿单。
    年年到头把工钱短，
    说是短下明年一起还，
    掌柜不会亏伙计，
    短欠给你上利钱，
    一年一年赊下去，
    到头来短下五年工钱没给俺。
    跟他要，他翻脸，
    反说俺穷疯讹他不长眼。
　
    想起过往事，真使俺心酸。
    多亏来了共产党，
    秋天领导俺把身翻。
    多年恨，一齐翻，
    俺一家一家去串连，
    诉了苦，伸了冤，
    算了血账，退了现钱。
    还分到好地五亩二，
    雪瓦楼房整三间，
    黄牛一头、羊一只，
    麦子一石五，小米八石三，
    又有桌来又有柜，
    单衣棉衣新崭崭………。
　
    九月里，菊花鲜，
    俺红红火火把家安。
    自由恋爱找对象，
    娶了个老婆叫马秀娟，
    手脚伶巧劳动好。
    文化水准也比咱沾。
    两口子，喜心间，
    齐心合意种地又纺棉。
　
    十月的太阳暖洋洋，
    民主选举闹翻天。
    俺老婆选进妇救会，
    农会副主席选上了咱。
    吃穿不愁成了家，
    又当了干部站在人前。
    东海岸升起一盆花，
    花朵儿落到了俺家院，
    毛主席恩德比天大，
    俺一生一世要听他的话，
    他说自卫俺去打仗，
    他说生产俺下劲干，
    打垮老蒋闹好生产，
    咱翻身的日子才长远。
