　　(This Newspaper Taiyue 18th Dispatch) Liuzhuang Village, one of the "Du Eight Joint Defense" in Jiyuan, has completed land reform by fighting while distributing land. The process is as follows: Liuzhuang Village is the vanguard area of the "Du Eight Joint Defense." When the enemy attacked Jiyuan, all the women, the old, and the weak in the village, except for the militia, were transferred to the rear. However, this was not a long-term solution. The village cadres studied and discussed organizing armed forces to defend their homes. Three days later, the people who had been transferred outside returned, and then they crushed eight encirclements and suppressions by Chiang's army. The village cadres further realized that armed struggle was a long-term process, and land reform must be carried out at the same time to enrich the armed forces and consolidate the armed struggle. Therefore, they proposed to the masses to carry out land reform through armed struggle and to distribute land. They said, "As long as the militia is here, there will be no enemy." So they distributed land while fighting. Fighting on the mountaintop, distributing land in the gully; fighting in the east of the village, distributing land in the west of the village; men fighting, women distributing land. There were four times when the enemy's bullets "buzzed" over the roof when the whole village was holding a meeting to settle accounts with the landlords, but the meeting continued as usual. Those who were fighting were determined to defend the land distribution, and those who were distributing land were at ease distributing land. When there were many enemies, they relied on joint village defense. For example, on the third day, the enemy arrived at Li Xianggong Village, only one li away from Liucun Village. Due to the strict joint defense, the militia of the brother villages of "Du Eight Joint Defense," Liandi, Wangling, and Qingshan, rushed over and repelled the enemy, and continued to distribute land. At the same time, each village of "Du Eight Joint Defense" used stone mines to stand guard, and landmines were generally buried on the roads of each village, thereby covering the land reform. Liuzhuang Village realized "land to the tiller" in ten days, and 90% of the farmers in the village had land. The masses said, "In the past, we were guarding the homes for the landlords, but now we are guarding our own homes, and we must work hard." This has further strengthened the armed struggle, and the "Du Eight Joint Defense" has become stronger and stronger in battle.

　　一面打仗一面分田  留庄完成土地改革
    “杜八联”愈战愈强
    【本报太岳十八日电】济源“杜八联”之一的留庄村，一面打仗一面分田，完成土地改革。经过情形如下：留庄村是“杜八联”的前卫地带，当敌人进攻济源时，全村除民兵外，妇女老弱皆转移后方，但这非长久之计，村干部研究讨论，组织武装保卫家乡，三天后，转到外面的人回来了，接着粉碎了蒋军八次围攻。村干部进一步认识到武装斗争是长期的，必须同时进行土地改革，充实武装巩固武装斗争，于是向群众提出武装进行土地改革，进行分田，他们说：“只要民兵在，就没有敌人。”于是便一面打仗一面进行分田了。山顶打仗，山沟分田，村东打仗，村西分田，男人打仗，女人分田。曾有四次全村群众正在开会与地主清算时，敌人的子弹便“嗡嗡”的从房顶飞过，但会仍照常开着，打仗的决心保卫分田，分田人安心分田，敌人多时，依靠联村联防。如三日敌人到了李相公村，仅距留村一里，由于联防严密，“杜八联”的兄弟村莲地、王岭、清山等村民兵，便一齐赶来，将敌击退，仍进行分田，同时“杜八联”各村，时时用石雷放哨，每个村庄的道路上普遍的埋设地雷，由此掩护了进行土地改革。留庄村十天实现了耕者有其田，全村百分之九十的农民有了土地。群众说：“过去是给地主看家，现在是给自己看家，要好好的干哩。”更加强了武装斗争，“杜八联”越战越强。
