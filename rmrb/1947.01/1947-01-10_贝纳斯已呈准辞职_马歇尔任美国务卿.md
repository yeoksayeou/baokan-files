Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 8th: According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 7th, President Truman announced today that Byrnes has resigned from the position of Secretary of State, and the vacancy has been filled by the current Special Envoy to China, Marshall. Marshall is scheduled to depart from Nanjing on the morning of the 8th to return to the United States, possibly with a brief stopover in Hawaii. Byrnes' resignation will take effect on the 10th of this month. In his resignation letter, Byrnes recalled that he had twice (April 16th and July 1st) submitted his resignation last year, but was unsuccessful due to President Truman's retention.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 8th: Various reports indicate that Baruch, the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission who drafted the plan for international control of atomic energy, had his resignation approved on the 5th. Those resigning at the same time as Baruch also included important personnel from the U.S. Atomic Energy delegation.
