The reason why the Hui County guerrilla war was able to develop smoothly, win every battle, and push the enemy to five miles from the city, allowing us to retain more than 1,080 villages and carry out land reform and production movements in these villages without any worries, is fundamentally due to the genuine implementation of the Party's unified leadership.

Its experience is:

　　I. Concurrent Positions and Powers Must Be Implemented

This autumn, when the Hui County Regiment and the Huojia Independent Battalion merged, Commanders × and × were led by County Head Xu Jianye (concurrently Regiment Commander). Afterwards, they often led a company in activities. County Secretary Du Yeping (concurrently Political Commissar) often stayed at the regimental headquarters to understand the troop situation and carry out consolidation work, and sometimes led troops in combat. Deputy Political Commissar of the Regiment Qiao Guoquan (concurrently Deputy County Secretary) also frequently represented the county party committee to inspect and instruct work in various places and solve problems. The county held training classes for activists, and the troops also sent cadres and soldiers to participate. Because of mutual understanding (between the local and the troops) and mutual learning (mass work and military work), and because each had its strengths and respected each other, the relationship between the army and the local area was more harmonious.

The county party committee is the highest leading organ of the Party, government, army, and people in the county. Whenever the army fought, not only was the target of the attack studied, but also how to fight and how to cooperate with the local area were discussed. After the army arrived at the battle location, it also discussed with the local leading organs, the district cadre teams, the armed work teams, the militia, the underground army, and the relevant village cadres and masses, allowing everyone to offer ideas. Although the issues were discussed very clearly, the masses could jointly keep secrets, so the enemy only knew when we started fighting, as was the case with the 75-mile raid on Zhaotun.

The district cadre teams also achieved concurrent positions and powers, with the district head serving as the captain and the branch secretary serving as the political commissar. At the same time, the leadership publicly announced: "The district cadre team is the people's armed force of your district," overcoming the district's fear that the district cadre team would be transferred away. Therefore, each district was able to wholeheartedly build this team. The branch secretary of the fifth district, Chengguan District, personally developed party members among the soldiers, and the district head and political commissar of the third district personally reviewed the soldiers and cleared out ×× suspected special agents... Therefore, although the district cadre teams were only established in July and August, and very few cadres were transferred from the troops, they are all very solid today, and in combat, except for Bopi District, which is slightly weaker, the other seven are very good.

　　II. The Command Post Must Be Sound and Become a Military Command Organ.

After the counter-offensive, the command post gradually became an organ with real power, with departments for command, combat intelligence, propaganda and education, and supply. In the village command post, the masses prepared for war and relocation, and there were dedicated personnel in charge. Because they had a tight intelligence network, the intelligence was timely and accurate, and the troops were sure to win as soon as they set out. The two attacks on ××× demonstrated this point. Also, because they had the cooperation of the mass guerrilla war, the troops did not feel any difficulties in combat.

The base of the command post is the village command post. This point has not received enough attention in the past. When the enemy attacked, the militia were concentrated in the joint defense or district command post. Without armed backbones, the masses were frightened. The militia were separated from the masses and could not actively attack the enemy, creating a large gap for the enemy to attack. Now, each joint defense command post has a unified combat plan and a joint defense convention. The village militia are scattered in peacetime, and retreat to protect the masses in wartime, and cooperate in combat in an organized manner.

　　III. From Continuous Victorious Actions, Chairman Mao's Tactical Thinking Was Uniformly Understood from Top to Bottom.

The unification of tactical thinking was a key to the transformation of the Hui County guerrilla war from silence to activity.

In the past, the local areas saw that the troops were not fighting and the enemy was acting crazily, and demanded that the troops be divided to guard key points. Until the end of October, we crushed the enemy's plan to attack Shangpan with superior forces, and then fought several beautiful battles in succession, making everyone realize that only by concentrating superior forces and being proactive can we eliminate the enemy's living forces (such as the attack on Zhaotun, where we used × companies against 30 people, and eliminated them all). Therefore, they demanded that the troops conserve their strength in order to fight more beautiful battles. At the same time, the command post called on the joint defense to fight independently without relying on the troops.

After annihilating the Zhaotun and Liuhe "Home-Returning Corps," the masses said: This is better than fighting a regiment. Therefore, the leadership solved the problem of "who to fight," realizing that the Home-Returning Corps was the most harmful to the masses, and fighting the Home-Returning Corps would get a better welcome and support from the masses. In the surprise attack on Zhaotun and the raid on ××× and Xiaozhuzhai, the troops felt that only by actively supporting the mass guerrilla war could they win more victories. Therefore, the troops moved to a mobile position and proposed: As long as there is accurate intelligence, we will respond to requests and arrive whenever called.

At the same time, they consciously led the district cadre teams, supported the militia, and supported them in carrying out small annihilation battles with confidence, and divided some of the spoils of victory to them. Therefore, the militia were willing to follow the main force to fight, and the district cadre teams automatically made plans and asked for the leadership of the regiment. The armed forces active behind enemy lines also created various ways to fight the enemy (such as Guo Xing). In order to eliminate the "Home-Returning Corps" in their area, the local masses took the initiative to find targets to gather intelligence and carry out capture operations, creating conditions for the large troops to fight. They gained mutual trust – accurate intelligence and no wasted effort, and the troops would win as soon as they fought. As a result, on the one hand, the arrogance of the Home-Returning Corps was suppressed, making it afraid to act rashly, which made it easier for our small armed forces to operate. In the past half month, they have opened up 31 villages behind enemy lines, captured 21 members of the Home-Returning Corps, and obtained 20 guns. On the other hand, it made it possible to carry out small annihilation battles at any time. The relationship between the main force regiment and the district cadre teams, armed work teams, and people's armed forces in combat was correctly resolved.

　　IV. From Action, the Relationship Between the Party, Government, Army, and People Was Further Strengthened, and the Spirit of Mutual Respect and Love Was Promoted.

In the eight battles and eight victories, the Party committee and the government changed their views on the army, recognizing the army as their own barrier. When the regiment's machine guns ran out of bullets, Political Commissar Du mobilized the masses to send × hundred rounds, and Chengguan District also sent × ten rounds. When the regiment lacked short guns, County Head Xu immediately drew × Mauser pistols from the government, and the government provided carts and livestock for transportation because the troops had a hard life. The command post notified the district and villages in advance to prepare rice, flour, firewood, and grass whenever the troops set out, and comforted them after the battles. The difficulties of the families of the soldiers could be resolved in a timely manner, and at the same time, the local areas took the initiative to help the army comrades establish their families. In order to encourage the troops to carry out the campaign to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service, the county's "Liberation Daily" promptly published their victory news and commended the heroic models.

When the troops had no difficulties, the soldiers were relieved of their worries, the troops were consolidated, and the phenomenon of desertion disappeared from June. Therefore, the troops especially emphasized the education of supporting the government and cherishing the people. They proposed: "We are the sons and soldiers of the people of Hui County, and we will leave a good reputation for the county." "The government is our backing, and we will become models for implementing policies." Therefore, the troops were very popular wherever they went, and the soldiers were also very disciplined. Whenever they had free time, they helped the masses with production and work. When they stayed in Yangyanchuan this summer, they also specially organized cadres and soldiers to help the masses to turn themselves. The soldiers returned to the villages to participate in the struggle, and the army turned over the spoils of victory to the government for distribution to the masses, except for military supplies. The government gave some of it back to them to encourage the troops. Therefore, the local masses praised them. Recently, when the county party committee inspected the saving of civilian labor, it considered Regiment ×× to be the best.

　　辉县游击战争
    党的一元化领导经验
    陶鲁笳　史洪
    辉县游击战争所以能顺利的发展，和每战必胜，并且把敌人压到离城五里的地方，使我们仍能据有一千零八十多个村庄，在这些村子里，还能毫无顾虑的进行翻身、生产运动，这基本上在于真正执行了党的一元化领导。
    他的经验是：
  　一、兼职兼权必须执行
    今秋辉县团与获嘉独立营合并，×、×连即由许建业县长（兼团长）带领，以后即常带一个连活动；县书杜野坪同志（兼政委）更常住团部，了解部队情况，进行巩固工作，有时也率部作战；团副政委乔国铨同志（兼地方县书副职），也常代表县委到各地检查指示工作，解决问题。县里开积极分子训练班、部队也派干部战士参加，由于互相了解（地方与团队），互相学习（群众工作与军事工作），因为各有长处，彼此都很尊敬，所以军队与地方关系更融洽了。
    县委会，是全县党政军民最高领导机关。军队每当作战，不但打的对象要经过研究，而且如何打与地方怎么配合，也都在讨论之列。军队到达作战地点后，又联同当地的领导机关，和配合作战的区干队、武工队、民兵、地下军与有关的村干部、群众在一起商讨，让大家出主意，虽然问题谈的很明朗化，但群众能共同保守秘密，所以只有我们打起来，敌人才知道，如七十五里奔袭赵屯即是。
    区干队也做到了兼职兼权，区长即队长，分书即政委。同时，领导上公开宣布：“区干队就是你区的人民武装”，克服了区上怕区干队调走的思想。因此，各区都能尽心的建设这支队伍。五区城关区分书，亲自在战士中发展党员，三区区长政委更亲自下手审查战士，清查出××个特务嫌疑分子……。因此，各区干队虽七、八月间才成立，部队调去干部也极少，但今天却都很巩固，在作战上，除薄壁区稍差外，其余七个都很好。
  　二、指挥部必须健全，并且成为军事指挥机关。
    反攻后，指挥部便渐渐变成一个实权机关，内设指挥、作战情报、宣教、供应等部，在村指挥部，群众备战转移，更有专人负责。由于他们有严密的情报网，所以情报既及时且准确，部队只要出师，必能取胜，两打×××都说明这点。也因为他们有群众游击战争配合，故部队作战毫不感困难。
    指挥部的基层是村指挥部。这点过去注意不够。敌人一进攻，就把民兵集中到联防或区指挥部，群众没了武装骨干，胆战心寒，民兵脱离群众，不能主动打击敌人，给敌进攻造成了很大空隙。现各联防指挥部有统一作战计划，有联防公约，各村民兵平日分散活动，战争一到，掩护群众退却，并有机的配合作战。
　  三、从不断的胜利行动中，自上而下的统一的体会了毛主席的战术思想。
    战术思想的统一，是辉县游击战争由沉寂转为活跃的一个关键。
    过去，地方上见部队不打仗，敌人活动疯狂，要求分兵把口，一直到十月末，我们以优势兵力粉碎了敌人上盘的计划，又接连打了几个漂亮仗，使大家认识了只有集中优势兵力，并且是主动的，才能消灭敌人有生力量，（如打赵屯，我们以×连对三十人，结果将其悉数消灭。）于是要求部队养精蓄锐，以便打更多漂亮仗，指挥部也于同时，号召联防单独作战，不依靠部队。
    在歼灭赵屯、流河“还乡团”后，群众说：这可比打一个团还好。于是，在领导上解决了“打谁”的问题，认识到还乡团对群众危害最大，打还乡团才能得到群众更好的欢迎拥护。在奇袭赵屯和奔袭×××、小朱宅战斗中，使部队感到只有积极的支持群众游击战争，才能打更多的胜仗，于是，部队转移到机动位置上，并提出：只要有准确的情报，有求必应，随说随到。
    同时又有意识的带领区干队、扶植民兵、为他们撑腰，进行有把握的小型歼灭战，得下胜利品又分给他们一部分。因此，民兵愿随基干队打仗，区干队也自动订计划，要求团里领导。在敌后活动的武装，又创造了各种各样的对敌斗争办法（如郭兴即是），当地群众为消灭他那里的“还乡团”，更主动的找对象搞情报，开展捕捉运动，为大部队作战创造条件，他们相互间便取得了信赖——情报准确不扑空，部队一打便得胜。结果，一方面压制了还乡团气焰，使它不敢轻举妄动，更便利了我小股武装活动。半月来，他们开辟了敌后三十一个村子工作，捕还乡团二十一，得枪二十支，另一面并使随时的进行小的歼灭战成为可能。正确的解决了基干团与区干队、武工队、人民武装在作战中的关系问题。
  　四、从行动中更密切了党政军民的关系，发扬了互敬互爱的精神。
    在八战八捷的斗争中，党委与政府改变了对军队的看法，认军队是自己的屏障。团里转盘机枪没了水连珠子弹，杜政委发动群众送去×百发，城关区也送去×十发。团里短枪不够用，许县长马上从政府里抽了×支驳壳枪，部队生活苦，政府里给了大车牲口作运输。部队每出发一地，指挥部即先通知该区村准备米面柴草，打了仗就慰劳。部队家属困难问题能得到及时解决，同时，地方上又主动的帮助军队同志建立家务。为鼓励部队开展杀敌立功运动，县《翻身报》及时刊载了他们的胜利消息，表扬了英雄模范。
    部队没了困难，战士去掉了后顾之忧，部队得到巩固，逃亡现象从六月绝迹，于是，部队内部便特别强调拥政爱民的教育，他们提出：“我们是辉县人民子弟兵，给县里留好名誉”“政府是我们的靠山，我们变成执行政策的模范”，所以部队到一个地方后，很受欢迎，战士们也非常规矩，一有空子，就帮助群众生产、工作，今夏在杨阎川住时，还专门组织了干部战士帮助群众翻身，战士回村参加斗争，部队打仗得下胜利品，除军用品外，即交政府转群众，政府为鼓励部队情绪，又提一部分给他们，所以当地群众莫不称赞。最近县委会检查节省民力时，又以××团为最好。
