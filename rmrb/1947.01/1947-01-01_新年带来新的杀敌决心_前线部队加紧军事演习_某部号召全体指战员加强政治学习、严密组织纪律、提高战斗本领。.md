[Report from our newspaper's correspondent on the front lines of the Jilu-Yu region, December 30th] The New Year has brought joy and a renewed determination to kill the enemy to our troops on the front lines. All commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the field army are busy with military exercises and political studies. They "want to celebrate the beginning of 1947 with a combat victory." The soldiers of the x Company of the 1st Battalion of the 76th Regiment borrowed many red-tasseled spears and danced in the snow from dawn, preparing to fight to the death to kill several more enemies. The commanders and fighters of the 72nd Regiment shouted, "Eliminate the Chiang troops and eat fatty meat." The x Company of the 74th Regiment has drawn up a plan to exchange for American-equipped weapons. The 78th Regiment is constantly approaching the enemy to capture prisoners. The soldiers are practicing movements in the freezing cold, morning and afternoon, to eliminate the current invading army. The leader of the unit issued a letter to all commanders and fighters at the end of the year, summarizing the victorious battles of 1946 and calling on the entire army to: (1) strengthen political study and intensify political life; (2) further strengthen organization and rectify discipline; (3) intensify military skills and improve combat capabilities; (4) strengthen mass discipline and mass work, so that everyone can be a hero and make great achievements in 1947, winning more brilliant victories and overthrowing the traitorous and dictatorial rule. The Pingyuan Opera Troupe continues to tour with "The White-Haired Girl," and is preparing to stage its newly created dramas "The Troops and Hero Flowers," "Don't Worry," and "Five Minutes to Twelve" in the New Year. In order to learn from the fraternal units fighting side by side, a certain unit has issued specially printed New Year cards to combat heroes of various frontline units. It reads: "You are the glory of the people. We hope you will carry forward your special strengths, continue your efforts, and crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. On the occasion of the New Year, we wish you good health!" In order to respond to the support of the government and the people and to strengthen military-civilian and military-government relations, the leader of the unit personally sent letters to Chairman Yang Rong and Speaker Bo of the border government, and to the Jinnan and Jilu-Yu Administrative Offices, making self-criticisms and requesting assistance. The unit received New Year greetings from rear organizations, troops, schools, and factories, led by Comrade Wang Congwu of the Jinnan District Party Committee, stating: "The New Year has arrived. For the victory of the war, we vow to do our best to ensure that the front has a continuous supply of soldiers and sufficient material supplies. We will certainly take good care of the families of soldiers and the glorious wounded comrades. Let us work together to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." All the commanders and fighters of the 76th Regiment wrote letters to their families, wishing their military dependents a Happy New Year.
