　　Changzi Beishan Village Catches Up
    "Tillers Own Their Land" Achieved in Seven Days
    Ten Poor Peasant Households Have All Risen
    [Report from our Taiyue Office on the 22nd] In Changzi, the mass movement turned towards backward villages, and Beishan Village achieved "tillers own their land" in seven days. Beishan Village, a small village one mile from the county seat, had not been mobilized from the recovery of Changzi until mid-December last year. Cadres believed that the masses in the village were too backward to carry out work. Comrade Wang Qicai of the Fourth District Farmers' Association, with curiosity, stepped into Beishan Village to conduct a trial. On the first day, he first convened a mass meeting to promote "tillers own their land" and encourage everyone to raise questions, but it failed; no one dared to speak. On the second day, the men in the village went to the city to boil saltpeter and transport goods, all slipping away. Wang Qicai was not discouraged and convened a women and children's meeting for idle chatter. A woman unintentionally revealed that Xu Yan'ao had occupied her seven houses, and her family was living in cramped conditions. Wang Qicai took the opportunity to inquire about Xu Ting'ao, what he did, and thus discovered five puppet village government personnel. He immediately conducted individual interviews to deeply understand Xu Ting'ao's situation and learned that the seven puppet village government personnel were middle peasants. He then convened a meeting of the seven middle peasants, induced them to confess their grievances, expose the crimes of the big local tyrant, and guaranteed not to struggle against them. A member of Xu's family said, "Because I worked in the puppet village government for a few days, I feel guilty, so 'when I see cadres passing through my village, my heart pounds.'" "Since this is the case, I will talk about my own suffering!" Thus, the crimes of the big local tyrants Xu Ting'ao and Xu Liangkui were exposed. On the seventh day, all the men who had gone out returned. Wang Qicai reconvened a mass meeting, where those who had spoken of suffering spoke of suffering, and the small puppet personnel confessed their grievances, which moved everyone's suffering. From this, the situation was opened up, with everyone complaining, and the whole village launched a struggle against Xu Ting'ao and Xu Liangkui. In a total of seven days, "tillers own their land" was achieved, and all ten poor peasant households in the village rose to become middle peasants.

　　长子北山村迎头赶上
    七天实现耕者有其田
    十户贫农都已上升
    【本报太岳二十二日电】长子群众运动转向落后村，北山村七天实现耕者有其田。距县城一里的小庄北山村，自长子收复至去年十二月中尚未发动过群众，干部认为该村群众太落后，无法进行工作。四区农会王启财同志抱着好奇心，踏进了北山村进行试探，第一天首先召集群众大会，宣传耕者有其田并启发大家提出问题，结果失败了，没有一个人敢说话。第二天村上的男人进城熬硝的、运输的，全溜走了、王启财不灰心，召开妇女儿童会闲扯，有个妇女无意中说出了因徐延熬霸占了她七间房子，一家人挤得住不下，王启财乘机探询徐廷熬，干什的，于是探索出五个伪村公所人员来，立即进行个别访问，深入了解徐廷熬等情形，并了解了七个伪村公所人员是中农，便召集了七个中农开会，诱导他们坦白诉苦，揭露大恶霸罪状，保证不斗他们。徐假女说：“因为自己做过几天伪村公所的事，心里鬼，所以“看见干部从我村过心就嘣嘣的跳。既然是这样，我就诉诉自己的苦吧！”于是揭露了大恶霸徐廷熬、徐良魁的罪恶。第七天，外出的男人全返回了，王启财重新召开群众大会，由说过苦的诉苦，小伪人员坦白诉苦，激动了大家苦处，由此打开了局面，你也诉我也诉，全村就向徐廷熬、徐良魁展开斗争。前后共七天，实现了耕者有其田，全村十户贫农上升中农。
