　　【Weixian, January 8th (Our Dispatch)】Since Chiang's troops occupied Daming, guerrilla warfare has unfolded intensely in Yuan Dynasty, Weixian, Yongnian, Daming and other areas. In Yuan Dynasty County, over 7,600 militiamen have been involved in training exercises, and 476 elite militiamen have formed an "Anti-Chiang Camp," which marched to the front lines on New Year's Day. Several thousand militiamen in Weixian County have already completed their reorganization. A certain militia company in the Second District won a battle after arriving on the south bank of the Zhang River. The Daming guerrilla team has increased its membership by over 90, and the militia has completed its organizational structure, now launching guerrilla warfare in coordination with the regular army.
    【Weixian, January 8th (Our Dispatch)】More than 300 soldiers from the Chiang army's 32nd Division advanced towards the area of Qianhoutun (northeast of Daming) on the 4th. After being intercepted by the local military and civilians, a fierce battle lasting dozens of minutes routed them, killing and wounding over 30 enemy soldiers.
    【Weixian, January 10th (Our Dispatch)】As Chiang and puppet troops occupy Daming, attempting to launch a major offensive towards southern Hebei, the puppet bandit Tie Mo's gang in Yongnian is again becoming restless, plundering grain, conscripting soldiers, and burning and killing indiscriminately. The broad masses of liberated peasants in Yongnian have risen up in self-defense, launching mine warfare and repelling the puppet bandits' repeated disturbances, killing and wounding dozens of them.
