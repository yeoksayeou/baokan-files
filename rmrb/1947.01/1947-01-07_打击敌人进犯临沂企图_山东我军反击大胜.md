    Striking at the Enemy's Attempted Invasion of Linyi
     Shandong Our Army Achieves a Great Victory in Counterattack
    Wiping out the Nationalist Army's 26th Division Headquarters and the Entire 44th Brigade, and a Large Part of the 169th Brigade and the 80th Brigade. Recaptured Xiangcheng, Bianzhuang, Lanling and more than 40 other strongholds.
    [New China News Agency, Shandong, Urgent Telegram, 5th] The New Fourth Army's East China Field Army, on the day after New Year's Day, counterattacked the Nationalist Army's 26th Division, led by Ma Liwu, which was attacking Xiangcheng, Bianzhuang, and Lanling (all located 70 to 90 li southwest of Linyi) in southern Shandong. After two nights and one day of fierce fighting, it has completed the great New Year's gift of annihilating a Nationalist Army division headquarters, an entire brigade, and a large part of two brigades, giving a heavy blow to the Nationalist Army's attempt to invade Linyi, the capital of the Shandong Liberated Area, and powerfully supporting the self-defense war in northern Jiangsu. This victory, together with the great victory of another elite force of the New Fourth Army's East China Field Army in wiping out more than 20,000 enemies in Su(qian) and Shu(yang) in northern Jiangsu at the end of last year, reflects the extremely strong self-defense capabilities of the military and civilians in East China. According to the No. 1 Communiqué issued by the Field Army Headquarters: Our army launched a self-defense counterattack on the Nationalist Army's 26th Division's 44th Brigade, 169th Brigade, and the 28th Division's 80th Brigade rapid column, which had occupied the Xiangcheng, Bianzhuang, and Lanling area, at midnight on January 2nd. That night, it occupied the heights of the Pingshan, Shichengyu, and Fenghuangshan line. After sixty hours of fierce fighting, it successively overcame more than 40 important strongholds such as Bianzhuang, Xiangcheng, and Lanling. The 26th Division Headquarters, the entire 44th Brigade, a large part of the 169th Brigade, and the 80th Brigade's rapid column were all annihilated. The entire 41st Brigade of the 26th Division had already been annihilated in the Su(qian) and Shu(yang) campaign in northern Jiangsu. By this point, the American-equipped 26th Division (formerly the 26th Army), one of the main forces of the Nationalist Army attacking southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, was nearly completely destroyed. As of the time of dispatch, our army has taken in more than 9,000 Nationalist Army prisoners, and the results of the battle are still being tallied.
