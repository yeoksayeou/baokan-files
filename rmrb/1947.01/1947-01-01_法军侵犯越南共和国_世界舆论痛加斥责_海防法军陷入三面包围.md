　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 29th: The French army's violation of the agreement and invasion of the Republic of Vietnam has aroused condemnation from world public opinion. According to Agence France-Presse, Moscow, December 26th: Moscow newspapers commented on the situation in Vietnam, pointing out: "It is clear that the Vietnamese people have no intention of yielding. French democrats should take measures to stop the bloodshed. The struggle of the Vietnamese people will be supported by friends of peace and security." According to the Associated Press, San Francisco, December 25th, the San Francisco Chronicle commented on the Vietnam incident: "Any Western powers who still want to put the yardstick of the 19th century on the people of the Far East are turning the clock back too far. The Vietnamese people no longer pay tribute to the symbol of colonial violence. Although the colonizers still have the power to carry out large-scale military operations against the colonies, they cannot do so; because world opinion will not support them!"

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 29th: According to comprehensive reports from various sources: The war in which the French army invaded the Republic of Vietnam is still expanding. On the 25th, the French army advanced towards Hue City in the west of Haiphong and occupied the European residential area of the city. However, the rest of the city and its suburbs are still firmly defended by the Vietnamese army. The French army's advance has been met with stubborn resistance from the Vietnamese army. The French army only controls the central area of Hanoi, and the rest is still guarded by several small teams of the Vietnamese army. The French army in Haiphong is surrounded by the Vietnamese army on three sides. The Blum government of France held a meeting on the 25th to discuss the Vietnam issue, but the decisions are unknown. However, on the same day, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a document blaming the Vietnamese side for "first launching the war," and the French Commissioner to Vietnam, D'Argenlieu, who was entrusted by the French government to handle the Vietnam incident, announced after arriving in Saigon with the French Overseas Minister, Marius Moutet, that he had "no intention of giving Vietnam complete independence." General Leclerc, who is known for commanding colonial troops, also left France for Vietnam on the 25th. Some observers in Paris believe that the Blum government seems to have sided with De Gaulle's colonial rulers group, supporting the war against Vietnam.

　　法军侵犯越南共和国
    世界舆论痛加斥责
    海防法军陷入三面包围
    【新华社延安十二月二十九日电】法军之违约侵犯越南共和国，已引起世界舆论之斥责。据法新闻社莫斯科二十六日电称：莫斯科报界评论越南情势时，指出：“很清楚的是，越南人民毫不打算屈服。法国民主人士应采取办法，阻止流血。越南人民的斗争，将获得和平与安全之友的支持。”又据美联社旧金山二十五日电，旧金山纪事报评论越南事件时称：“任何西方列强现在还想把十九世纪的准绳重新放在远东人民身上，那就把时钟倒拨得太远了。越南人民已不再向殖民者暴力的象征致敬了。殖民者虽仍有进行大规模军事行动以对付殖民地的力量，但是他们不可能这样做；因为世界舆论不会拥护他们！”
    【新华社延安十二月二十九日电】综合各方报导：法军侵犯越南共和国的战事仍在扩大中。法军二十五日已向海防西部之顺化城进犯，侵占该城欧洲人住宅区。唯该城其余部分及近郊仍在越军坚守中。法军之推进，已受越军之顽强抵抗。法军仅控制河内方面中心区，其余部分仍为若干小队越军据守，海防方面法军处于越军三面包围中。法国勃鲁姆政府于二十五日举行会议，商讨越南问题，决策未悉。唯同日法外交部公布文件嫁祸越方“首先发动战争”，而受法政府之托全权处理越南事件之法驻越专员达根留于偕同法海外部长摩泰特抵西贡后，即宣布“无予越南完全独立之意”。向以统率殖民地军队著称之法将勒克勒克，亦于廿五日离法飞越。巴黎若干观察家认为，勃鲁姆政府似已站到戴高乐之殖民地统治者集团方面，支持对越战争。
