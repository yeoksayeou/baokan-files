    Question:
    I have a few questions regarding the article "Chiang-American Aviation Agreement" published in your newspaper on December 4th:
    (1) Didn't Chiang Kai-shek sign an agreement with the United States on August 31st allowing Chennault to organize an air transport squadron to fly in various parts of China? Why is the Chiang bandit now forming an aviation agreement with the American imperialists?
    (2) In the Chiang-American Aviation Agreement, China designates Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou as locations. Does this mean that American planes can fly anywhere else besides these designated locations?
    (3) After the Chiang-American Aviation Agreement is established, is the signing on August 31st still valid?
    Reader: Hao Yumen

    Answer:
    The air transport contract signed between the Chiang government and Chennault at the end of August was the first step in Chiang Kai-shek's selling of China's aviation rights. This contract stipulated the establishment of the Chennault Air Transport Company under the name of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration. Its task was to transport so-called Executive Yuan materials and also to transport commercial goods, and the distribution areas of the Executive Yuan relief materials were also included in the company's route range. The establishment of this company coincided with the signing of the surplus goods sales treaty and was closely related to the "China-America Industrial Corporation" founded by Chennault and Chinese comprador bureaucratic capitalists. Therefore, it not only facilitated the Kuomintang's transportation of American military supplies to the civil war front, but also enabled the "China-America Industrial Corporation" to further strengthen its monopoly over China's economy.
    The Chiang-American Aviation Agreement signed on December 20th is Chiang Kai-shek's further and comprehensive betrayal of China's aviation rights. If the former was a retail sale with Chennault privately, then the latter is a wholesale deal with the American government. The so-called designation of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou as landing points in China is actually "designated" based on the needs of the three Sino-American routes: North Pacific, Central Pacific, and Atlantic. As for whether it can fly arbitrarily in other places besides the above three places, one only needs to look at the provision "and can load and unload passengers, goods and mail at any location agreed upon in the future" to know that as long as American imperialism needs it, the Chiang government can agree at any time. To understand the full significance of this traitorous agreement, please refer to the Xinhua News Agency commentary in this newspaper on December 29th.
    The above two contracts, although mutually supportive, are, after all, two different things, and the latter does not affect the validity of the former. (Editor)

    问：
    贵报十二月四号报登载《蒋美成立航空协定》一文，我有几个问题：
    （一）蒋介石不是在八月三十一日已和美国签订准许陈纳德组织空运大队在中国各地飞行吗？为什么蒋贼现在又和美帝国主义成立航空协定呢？
    （二）蒋美航空协定中，中国指定地点为天津、上海、广州三处。是否除指定地点外，美国飞机还能任意飞行各地呢？
    （三）蒋美航空协定成立后，八月三十日的签订是否还有效？
    读者郝玉门
    答：
    八月底蒋政府和陈纳德签订的空运合同，是蒋介石出卖中国航空权的第一步，该合同系规定在行政院救济总署的名义下，设立陈纳德航空运输公司，其任务除运输所谓行总物资外，并兼运商货，而行总救济物资分配地区亦均划入该公司航线范围。这个公司的成立，是在签订让售剩余物资条约的同时，并与由陈氏和中国买办官僚资本家们所创办的“中美实业公司”有密切关系，故不仅便利了国民党运输美国军火到内战前线，而且使“中美实业公司”得以更加加强对中国经济的垄断。
    十二月廿日签订的蒋美航空协定，是蒋介石进一步全面出卖中国航空权的勾当。如果说前者为与陈纳德私人之间的零售，那末后者就是对美国官方的批发。所谓中国指定天津、上海、广州三处为起落地点，实际上是根据中美间北太平洋、中太平洋及大西洋三条航线的需要而“指定”的。至于在上述三地以外，还能不能在各地任意飞行，那只要看“并可以在以后随时同意之地点载卸乘客、货物与邮件”的规定，就可以知道，只要美帝国主义有所需要，蒋政府是随时可以同意的。这个卖国协定的全部意义如何，请参看十二月二十九日本报之新华社评论，便可明了。
    上述两契约，虽互为依辅，但总算是两回事，后者是不影响前者之有效性的。（编者）
