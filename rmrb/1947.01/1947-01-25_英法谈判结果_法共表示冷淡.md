Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Reuters reports: The French Communist Party reacted coldly to the results of the Anglo-French negotiations in London. The French Communist Party's organ, L'Humanité, declared on the 16th: If the coal shortage problem is not resolved, the alliance with Britain risks failing to achieve the solidarity between the two countries hoped for by the French people. French Communist Party spokesman Pont announced: Negotiations between the two countries on the coal issue have not yet yielded positive results. He continued: "We welcome the steps towards an Anglo-French alliance, but we believe that this must include an understanding of our basic needs; that is why we are asking for more Ruhr coal."
