　　Guan County Completes Land Reform
    [This newspaper, Weixian, 21st dispatch] Guan County has thoroughly completed land reform. During the movement, due to the active unity with the middle peasants, the number of households participating in the struggle reached 90 percent, and the number of people participating in the organization reached 70 percent. Blank villages and backward villages have been eliminated. In villages such as Anzhuang and Yuanzhuang, the cadres were previously manipulated by landlords, creating false struggles. In villages such as Yaozhuang and Yangsi, the cadres engaged in sectarianism and sheltered unlawful landlords who were related to them. In villages such as Huyan, the cadres' style of commandism was serious, making it difficult to mobilize the masses. The problems in these villages have all been resolved, and the masses are now fully mobilized, waging a resolute struggle against feudal forces.

　　冠县完成土地改革
    【本报威县廿一日电】冠县已彻底完成土地改革。运动中由于积极团结了中农，参加斗争户数达百分之九十，参加组织人数达百分之七十，空白村、落后村均已消灭。安庄、圆庄等村干部过去为地主操纵，制造假斗争；要庄、杨寺地等村干部闹宗派，并掩护与自己有关系的不法地主。胡阎等村干强迫命令作风严重，群众难于发动。这些村庄的问题都已解决，群众现已充分发动起来，对封建势力作了坚决斗争。
