　　Our Army Annihilates Another Enemy Regiment Outside Jinxiang
    Puyang County Recovered by Our Army
    [Report from the Jilu豫 Frontline of this newspaper on the 14th] From the 12th to the 13th, the Eighth Route Army on the outskirts of Jinxiang annihilated another regiment of the pseudo-Zhang Lanfeng's troops. Pseudo-Zhang Lanfeng, in an attempt to relieve the siege of the Chiang troops in Jinxiang, personally led his troops to invade eastward from Dingtao. As soon as they arrived at Tianji, 40 li west of Jinxiang, they were surrounded by a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army. From the 12th to the 13th, one regiment had already been annihilated. According to incomplete statistics, we have already captured two mountain guns, eight mortars, and five vehicles. Other spoils are being inventoried.
    [Report from the Jilu豫 Frontline of this newspaper on the 14th] (Delayed) The Chiang troops occupying Puyang County were panic-stricken under the tight encirclement of the local military and civilians, fearing annihilation. They broke through and fled westward on the 11th, and the city was then recovered by our army.
