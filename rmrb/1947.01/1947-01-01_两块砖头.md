　　Two Bricks
　　Zhi Wei
　　In the Taihang Second Session of the Hero Conference’s Turn-Over Exhibition Hall, crowds of visitors lined up in long rows and poured in incessantly.
　　While we were busy copying down "What kind of life did the landlords live for thousands of years, and what kind of suffering did the poor endure," the two sentences, "The landlord's family had embroidered silk comforters filled with silk floss; the poor people slept on straw mats with bricks as pillows," attracted our attention.
　　The red satin comforter was displayed on the table, and the tattered black lacquer comforter was also placed on a broken straw mat with four missing corners. What was especially noteworthy were the two bricks placed on the straw mat.
　　These two bricks were old friends of Sun Haimeng and his son; and also his "sworn enemies".

　　两块砖头
    稚微
    在太行第二届群英大会的翻身展览馆里，参观的人群排成很长的行列，络绎不绝的拥挤进来。
    我们几个人在忙着抄写那“几千年来地主过的是什么生活，穷人受些什么痛苦”的时候，“地主家绣花被子套丝绵；穷人家身铺席片头枕砖”，这两句话，吸引了我们的视线。
    那红绸缎被子排在桌子上，破烂不堪的黑漆被子也放在一张穷窟窿破四角的席片上，尤其值得注意的，是席片上放着的那两块砖头。
    这两块砖头，是孙海梦父子俩的老朋友；又是他的：“死对头”。
