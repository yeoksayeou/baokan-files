　　The Banner of the South Mountain People's Struggle
    Duan Fazhang's Armed Work Team
    [This newspaper, Changzhi dispatch] Since the Duan Fazhang militia armed work team of the third district of Anyang advanced behind enemy lines for more than a month, it has repeatedly struck at the enemy's vanguard and has become the banner of the South Mountain people's struggle in the district. Since its establishment, the armed work team has engaged the enemy in 35 battles of all sizes. It has captured 14 despotic landlords and pseudo-joint guarantee secretaries, wounded one Chiang Kai-shek soldier, recovered eight strongholds of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet "Homecoming Corps," and forced the pseudo-Sanmin Township Office to move to Lunzhang Market. Fourteen of the seventeen villages in the district are completely controlled by our Fazhang Armed Work Team, and three villages have entered the struggle against counter-reckoning.
    The growth of the Fazhang Armed Work Team has not been smooth sailing. At first, no one dared to take action. Fazhang painstakingly mobilized five people to carry out a political offensive in Wanzhang River Village and engaged in an encounter with the enemy. Everyone was a little panicked. In the second attack, they captured the Wanzhang River village chief, and the militia gained some confidence. However, in the third attack on Cai Village, they were ambushed by the enemy, and Comrade Zhao Ming, a branch committee member, was sacrificed. The morale of the militia declined again. However, at the solemn memorial meeting for Comrade Zhao Ming, the Fazhang militia armed work team was commended. At that time, the leadership also proposed avenging Comrade Zhao Ming and making meritorious service by killing the enemy, and everyone's enthusiasm was boosted again. Comrade Fazhang also swore on the spot: "It is glorious to die for the people!" He went to Hejiafen and Tongye alone to carry out activities. The militiamen saw that he was okay and that his marksmanship was excellent, and they were willing to follow him in guerrilla warfare, saying, "Following Fazhang is not scary; if he dares to go there, we dare to go there too." Comrade Fazhang united and improved the masses with his practical actions, and his armed work team grew in strength.

　　南岭人民斗争的旗帜
    段法章武工队
    【本报长治讯】安阳三区段法章民兵武工队挺进敌后月余以来，屡创敌锋，已成为该区南岭人民斗争的旗帜。该武工队成立以来，共与敌进行大小战斗卅五次。生擒恶霸地主、伪联保书记等十四名，击伤蒋军一名，收复蒋伪“还乡团”据点八个，逼使伪三民乡公所迁至伦掌集内。该区十七个村有十四个村为我法章武工队完全控制，三个村已进入反倒算斗争。
    法章武工队的成长并不是一帆风顺的，开始，谁也不敢去活动，法章苦口婆心动员了五人，到湾漳河村开展政治攻势，和敌人打了个遭遇战，大家少有恐慌，二次出击，捉回湾漳河保长，民兵才有了些信心。但第三次出击蔡村，遭敌埋伏，分委赵明同志牺牲，民兵的情绪又消沉下来，但在隆重追悼赵明同志的大会上，法章民兵武工队受到了表扬。当时领导上并提出为赵明同志复仇，杀敌立功，大家劲头又鼓起来了，法章同志并当场宣誓说：“为人民死了也名气！”他单人匹马到何家坟、同冶一带去活动。民兵们看到他没事，枪法又高，愿意跟他一起打游击，都说：“跟上法章不害怕，他敢到那里我们也敢到那里”。法章同志以他的实际行动，团结群众并提高了群众，他的武工队便就这样壮大起来。
