Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, January 22nd: (Delayed) Since the Chiang-Fu troops occupied the Ping-Sui Railway, which is difficult to access, they have repeatedly carried out "sweeping" operations in the Sanggan River area south of the railway. The Eighth Route Army and local guerrillas defending both sides of the Sanggan River in Chahar South and Northern Shanxi, in November and December of last year, successively crushed two "sweeping" operations by over 10,000 Chiang-Fu troops in Yujiahe (under Zhuolu), Shangdaozhan (under Yu County), Hejuyao (Guangling), Cuoxian Temple (Xuanhua) in Chahar South, and Bianyue and Yanlaoshan in Ying County, Northern Shanxi. A total of 59 battles were fought, resulting in over 900 enemy casualties, including a deputy regimental commander and below, and the capture of over 100 enemies. Currently, with the exception of a few isolated strongholds, the vast areas on both sides of the Sanggan River are in the hands of the People's Liberation Army, and the mass-based guerrilla warfare is developing day by day.

    坚守察南雁北桑干河岸
    我军两月歼敌千余
    【新华社晋察冀二十二日电】（迟到）自蒋傅军侵占难以通车之平绥路后，即向铁路南侧桑干河地区进行反复“扫荡”。坚守桑干河两岸之察南、雁北八路军及地方游击队，于去年十一、十二两月，先后于察南之于家河（涿鹿属）、上刀蝉（蔚县属）、贺具窑（广灵属）、厝县寺（宣化属）及雁北应县属之边跃、阎老山等地，粉碎蒋傅军万人以上之两次“扫荡”。计作战五九次，毙伤敌副团长以下九百余人，俘敌百余人。现桑干河两岸除少数孤立据点外，广大地区均在人民解放军手中，群众性的游击战争日益发展。
