Yuncheng and Ju'ye People
Celebrate the Spring Festival in Liberation
[Report from the JiluYu Front, this newspaper, 25th] The people of Yuncheng joyfully celebrated the Lunar New Year after the city was liberated. To avoid bombing by Chiang's planes, the market was held earlier in the day. From the 20th day of the twelfth lunar month until the New Year, 15,000 to 20,000 jin of pork were available on the market every day. Each liberated citizen could eat one jin of pork. Peasant Association member Wang Xinde borrowed 10,000 yuan in the summer to buy a pig and several lambs, and was also allocated three mu of land. Now he has earned more than 20,000 yuan. His family ate five jin of pork for the New Year. Liu Qingzhen and two peasant association members in Xiguan borrowed 20,000 yuan to buy cigarette paper and earned 100,000 yuan, so they happily bought pork for the New Year. Old woman Liu said, "In the past, we were superstitious and spent a lot of money on incense, paper horses, but this year we bought food instead." Liu Qingzhen said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army driving away Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous troops, liberating the people and leading us to turn over a new leaf, how could we have such a good New Year?"

[Report from the JiluYu Front, this newspaper, 25th] On Lunar New Year's Eve, snow was falling heavily. The people of Dianhucun, north of Ju'ye city, were busy celebrating the New Year and supporting the front lines, organizing stretcher teams. Three sets of stone rollers were busy milling rice to send to the front. Children were constantly setting off firecrackers, and every family put up Spring Festival couplets. One family had this couplet posted on their door: "Bid farewell to the old year and have a good time; celebrate the new year and never forget Chairman Mao." This is a liberated area of one year. After the emancipation movement, the people's lives have improved. In the past, they suffered from hunger and cold, and bandits were rampant. After the Eighth Route Army liberated the area, the people of Dianhucun became masters of their own fate. Last autumn, Chiang Kai-shek's troops came, and the bad landlord Yang Zesi, who had been struggled against, also returned to his village. He turned the returning team's headquarters into his home. Dianhucun was surrounded by three layers of wooden stockades, and the trees in the village were all cut down, leaving only Yang Zesi's large woods. Yang Zesi said triumphantly on the street, "The Eighth Route Army has been driven into the grasslands, and a few American atomic bombs will finish them off." He also sarcastically said to the honest people in the village: "Struggle, hold meetings, give up food." Yang EnYang, a lackey, became a village cadre on the second day after Chiang's troops arrived. He took away the food and furniture of more than a dozen militia families who were fighting guerrilla warfare, and even tied up the mother of militiaman Chang Long and pushed her into a water pit to drown her. The people of Dianhucun were imprisoned in cages, longing for the arrival of the Eighth Route Army every day. As soon as the guns outside went off, the villagers were happy, "The Eighth Route Army is attacking the stockade!" They secretly watched outside the door through the cracks at night. "Is there really an Eighth Route Army?" One night, Village Chief Yang Chengyang, an old militiaman, took a Hubei-made rifle, carried a ladder, and led the backbone brigade. In the time it takes to smoke a cigarette, they wiped out all these returning teams, captured more than 100 people, and obtained more than 50 guns. Since then, County Chief Wang often came at night to talk to the people and hold meetings. On New Year's Day in the Western calendar, the main force of the Eighth Route Army arrived, and the people of Dianhucun smiled. After opening Ju'ye, the returning team leader Yang Zesi was also captured. County Chief Wang issued a notice to appease the people, telling those with grievances to seek revenge, and those with injustices to right their wrongs. The grain and land that had been taken back must be returned." Ten days ago, Yang Zesi, who had taken back grain and land, was shot. The refugees have all returned home for a reunion. Zhang Zhilan said, "Who would have thought that we could have such a New Year this year? We returned home, the grain was returned, and the revenge was taken."

    郓城、巨野人民
    欢庆解放中度春节
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五日电】郓城人民重庆解放，愉快的度过旧历新年。为避免蒋机轰炸，市上改成早集。从旧历二十日起到新年，每天有一万五到两万斤猪肉上市。翻身市民每人可以吃到一斤猪肉。农会员王心得夏天贷款一万元，买了一口猪和几只小羊，又分了三亩地，现在赚了两万多元，年下一家吃了五斤猪肉。刘庆珍和西关的两个农会员贷了两万元卷纸烟，赚了十万元，过年时高兴的买了猪肉。刘大娘讲：“过去迷信，年下卖香帛纸马、花很多钱，今年都买成吃的东西了。”刘庆珍说：“要不是共产党八路军把蒋介石的卖国军队打跑，解放了老百姓又领导咱翻了身，怎能过这样的好年下呢。”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五日电】旧历除夕大雪纷飞，巨野城北佃户屯人民一面忙着过年，一面忙着支援前线，组织担架，三盘碾正忙着碾米送往前方。孩子们不断的放着爆竹，家家贴上对联，有一家门上贴着：“辞旧岁得过好光景，过新年不忘毛主席。”这里是一年的解放区，经过翻身运动，人民的生活已得到改善，过去是啼饥号寒，盗贼如麻，八路军解放后，佃户屯的人民当了主人。去秋蒋介石的军队来了，被斗争的坏地主杨泽泗也还了乡，把还乡队队部接到了他家，佃户屯被围上了三层木寨，村里的树被砍光了，只剩下杨泽泗家的大树林，杨泽泗在大街上得意的说：“八路军被赶到草地里去了，几个美国原子弹就炸完了。”他还讽刺着村里的老实人：“斗争吧，开会吧，倒粮吧。”狗腿子杨恩养在蒋军来的第二天就当了村干，他把十来家打游击的民兵的粮食和家俱都弄走了，还把民兵昌龙的母亲捆起来推到水坑里淹死。佃户屯的人民被囚在笼子里，整天价盼着八路军到来，只要外面的枪一响，村里的人就高兴起来，“八路军打寨子了。”他们夜里从门缝里偷偷的望着门外。“真有八路军吗”？一天晚上，村长杨成扬这个老民兵拿着枝湖北造，抬着梯子，领着基干大队来了，吸袋烟的功夫就将这些还乡队全部解决，俘虏一百多人，得了五十多枝枪，从此王县长经常夜里来和老百姓讲话开会。阳历年元旦八路军大军来到了，佃户屯的人民笑了。打开巨野后，又捉住还乡队长杨泽泗，王县长就出榜安民，叫有仇的报仇，有冤的报冤，倒回去的粮食，土地还得倒回来。”十天前将倒粮倒地的杨泽泗枪毙了，逃难的人都回家团圆了。张芝兰说：“谁想到今年能过这样的年呢？回了家，粮又倒回了，仇又报了。”
