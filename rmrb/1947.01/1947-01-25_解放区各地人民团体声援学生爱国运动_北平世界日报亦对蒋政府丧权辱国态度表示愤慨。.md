　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 18th: More than 1,800 representatives from various organizations in the city gathered at the Longjiang Grand Theater on the 13th to protest against American military atrocities and demand the immediate withdrawal of American troops from China. Representatives from the Nenjiang Provincial Women's Federation, the Deputy Speaker of the Qiqihar City Council, the President of the Chamber of Commerce Mr. Han, representatives from the Trade Union, and student representatives spoke successively, pointing out that the presence of American troops in China was like a heavy stone weighing down on the Chinese people, preventing them from standing up. We must use all our strength to drive them away. The conference also sent telegrams to compatriots across the country and to various democratic parties, expressing support for the patriotic movement of students in the Chiang-controlled areas.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: The Youth, Women, Workers, Peasants, and Students' Federation of Central China, the Literary Association, the Journalists' Federation, the Construction University, the Middle School Students' Federation, the Shandong Provincial Students' Federation, the United Middle School of Heilongjiang Province, the Harbin Women's Federation, and others have successively sent telegrams to express support for the patriotic movement of students in the Chiang-controlled areas of Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places, who are promoting national integrity.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: Beiping dispatch: The World Daily, known here for its pro-Kuomintang stance, also expressed particular indignation in its editorial on the 18th at the Kuomintang authorities' traitorous and humiliating attitude in the case of the American military atrocities in Beiping. After pointing out the legitimacy of the patriotic movement of students in various places, the newspaper then rebuked the Kuomintang authorities, saying: "What surprises us most is that since the Shen case occurred, why has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not issued a single formal protest? Apart from hoping or suggesting that newspapers in various places not publish this news and issuing orders to the authorities of various schools to advise and prevent students from taking 'irregular' actions, the government has never announced to the people the diplomatic steps and negotiations on this matter. This shows the government's weakness and disqualification."

　　解放区各地人民团体声援学生爱国运动
    北平世界日报亦对蒋政府丧权辱国态度表示愤慨。
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十八日电】本市各机关团体代表一千八百余人，于十三日在龙江大戏院集会，抗议美军暴行，要求美军立即撤离中国。会上嫩江省妇联代表、齐市副参议长，商会韩会长、工联代表、学生代表相继发言，指出美军驻华等于在中国人民身上压一块大石头，想不使中国人民翻身。我们必须用一切力量，把它赶走。大会并通电全国同胞及各民主党派，声援蒋管区的学生爱国运动。
    【新华社延安十八日电】华中青妇工农学联、文协、记者联合会、建设大学、中学生联合会、山东省学联、合江省联合中学、哈尔滨妇联等，纷纷通电声援蒋管区平津沪宁等地学生，发扬民族正气的爱国运动。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】北平讯：此间素以亲国民党著名的世界日报于十八日社论中亦对国民党当局在北平美军暴行事件中丧权辱国态度表示特别愤慨。该报于指出各地学生爱国运动之正当性后，继即斥责国民党当局称：“最使我们惊异的，即由沈案发生到现在，外交部何以始终都没提一纸正式抗议。政府除了希望或示意各地报纸不要登载此项消息和通令各校当局劝导并阻止学生“越规”行动外，始终没有向人民宣布对此事的外交步调和交涉经过，在这里显出政府的软弱和失格。”
