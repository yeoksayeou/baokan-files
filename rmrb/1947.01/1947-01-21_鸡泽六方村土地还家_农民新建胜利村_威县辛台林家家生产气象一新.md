　　【Weixian County, 16th dispatch of this newspaper】In Xiliufang Village, five miles west of the Niwei River in the second district of Jize, liberated farmers are building a new village. The soil here is fertile and the terrain is flat. In the past, it was occupied by landlords, but now it has been recovered by the farmers of Xiliufang. During the tense autumn harvest, the farmers leveled the ground and built walls, and now they have built 40 new houses. The new village covers an area of 32 mu and has been named "Victory Village" by the farmers. Zhao Yongcheng, the first farmer to build a house, has already moved in. More than a dozen families, including Li Baosan, are ready to move there as soon as the foundations are prepared. In Xintai Village, Weixian County, all 156 families in the Lin family have towel machines, producing 260 dozen towels every day, earning 30,000 yuan in profits daily. All 68 impoverished peasant households in the village have risen to the status of middle peasants. Wang Chunde, who used to beg for a living, is now a farmer representative and is building a new house. The landlords after the land reform have abandoned their decadent lives and are engaged in farming and weaving. When I visited Mr. Li Jingbo after the first snowfall, he said: "In the new society, bad people have become good. I am a well-known landlord, and now I have learned to work. During the liquidation, because his family had 30 people, he was allowed to keep a cow, 60 mu of land, and three towel machines, and the money he earned was enough to support the whole family."

　　鸡泽六方村土地还家
    农民新建胜利村
    威县辛台林家家生产气象一新
    【本报威县十六日电】鸡泽二区距牛尾河西岸五里的西六方村，翻身农民正建设新村。该地土质肥沃，地势平坦，过去被地主霸占，至今始被西六方农民收回。农民在紧张的秋收中即平基打墙，现已盖起新房四十间。新村共占地三十二亩，农民们定名为“胜利村”。盖房最早的农民赵永城已经移去，李保三等十几家等盘好坑后也就往那里搬。威县辛台林全村一百五十六家，家家有毛巾机，每天生产二百六十打毛巾，每天可得三万元的红利，全村六十八户赤贫农全部上升中农。昔日讨吃为生的王春德，现在当了农民代表，正盖着新房。土地改革后的地主们，已抛掉腐朽的生活，男耕女织。大雪初晴，我去访问李静波先生，他说：“在新社会里，坏人都变好了，我是有名的大地主，现在也学会劳动了。清算时因他家有三十口人，曾给留了一头牛，六十亩地，加上三架毛巾机，赚得钱足够全家生活。”
