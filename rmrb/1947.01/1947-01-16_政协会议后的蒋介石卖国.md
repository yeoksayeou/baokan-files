Chiang Kai-shek's Treachery After the Political Consultative Conference
	Our Newspaper's Archives

U.S. imperialism is actively helping Chiang Kai-shek to carry out the civil war and maintain his comprador-feudal fascist dictatorial rule, while intensifying its aggression to colonize China. The traitorous and despotic emperor Chiang Kai-shek is also meticulously following orders from his master, U.S. imperialism, granting every request and exhausting all means to sell out national sovereignty and interests.

	Since the customs were taken over by our country, the Chiang government has appointed the American Li Du as the Inspector General of Customs. In early June, the Englishman Bai Lichazha was appointed as the Commissioner of Customs for the Jianghai Customs. Amidst opposition from all sectors against the sale of customs administration, the Chiang government transferred the Shanghai pilotage management rights from outside the Wusongkou of Shanghai to Tongsha to the customs authorities.

	In April, the new Company Law was officially promulgated and implemented, granting privileges to foreign companies. In July, according to statistics, eleven foreign banks in Central China had resumed business. They not only demanded to engage in normal banking business but also wanted to issue foreign currencies. By August, there were as many as thirteen foreign-owned banks in Shanghai alone, with assets of 8,000 billion yuan and deposits of 15.3 trillion yuan.

	In May, the Chiang government allowed the well-known American "Westinghouse" Electric Company to establish a large-scale factory in China. In June, it also allowed "wealthy", "talented" Americans and Canadians to engage in power, electrical appliance, and steelmaking businesses in China. The U.S. will also take over the Three Gorges Hydropower Plant.

	In June, the U.S. Foreign Economic Supply Bureau invested 190 billion yuan in various departments in China. The large trust, Universal Company, has obtained the rights to explore and extract oil in Northwest China, and twenty-five wells are already under extraction in the Gobi Desert. In July, American Elno Metals Company announced their "cooperation" plan. According to this plan, aluminum will be smelted using Japanese aluminum mines in the Northeast and Taiwan, and Chinese bauxite, or high-grade bauxite produced in Dutch Guiana in South America, and equipment will be expanded. In September, the Kuomintang Resources Committee decided to "cooperate" with the Aluminum Company of America. The U.S. will send experts to inspect the light metal industries left by the Japanese in Shandong and Taiwan.

	In early July, Chennault and Chinese comprador-bureaucratic capitalists initiated the establishment of the huge monopolistic enterprise "Sino-American Industrial Corporation". The head office is located in Shanghai, and branch offices are established in Nanjing, Hankou, Changsha, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Guiyang and other places. The former U.S. Air Force 14th Air Fleet requested the Kuomintang government to open up industrial zones in Shaoguan (northern Guangdong, located on the Yuehan Railway) and Shaoyang (central Hunan, located on the Xiangqian Highway). It is reported that the Kuomintang authorities are negotiating detailed arrangements with the U.S. side.

	In July, according to statistics, since the promulgation of the new Company Law, American companies and firms have opened 115 branches in Shanghai, including 40 established by American head offices and 75 by commissioned agencies. Most of them are engaged in import and export business. In September, the "Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association," jointly organized by more than 400 large and small American factories, has now appointed ten representatives to fly from the U.S. to Chongqing and then to Chengdu, Kunming, Xichang and other places for a preliminary investigation before investing in the southwestern provinces. Since the signing of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, the American China Chamber of Commerce "has decided to send a commercial delegation to China for a visit." More than 20 ready-made factories in the United States are about to arrive in China. These factories include flour mills, automobile assembly plants, spinning mills, hydroelectric power plants, and warehouses.

	In September, the total U.S. investment in the Yuehan Railway was 61 million U.S. dollars, and the U.S. accounted for two-thirds of the total investment in the Yuehan Railway. In October, it was reported that China and the United States would jointly run the Yuehan Railway, and the United States was willing to lend 500 million U.S. dollars. In addition, the Sichuan Railway will be built with joint investment from the United States and France.

	The "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" was established in June, and the aggressive claws of the U.S. extended into China's vast rural areas.

	In September, the Chiang government allowed Taiwan to supply the U.S. military with 1,000 tons of cement and 800 tons of timber per month for island defense.

	The Chiang government and MacArthur's headquarters representatives reached an agreement allowing 40 Japanese sea vessels to fish in the so-called "high seas" between China and Japan—areas beyond the sea mile from the coast, which is actually the Chinese coast—for one year. In June, it was heard that the Chiang government allowed the export of 2,000 tons of pig iron to Japan. The phosphate production of Haizhou and Jinzhou will be supplied to Japan. The first batch was shipped in early July, and the second batch was shipped starting on "August 13." In September, the Chiang government ordered 500 locomotives and 3,000 train cars from Japanese financial groups. Japanese financial groups proposed the following conditions: China must import 60,000 tons of iron ore and 205,000 tons of high-quality coking coal. In addition, the Chiang government announced that it would transport 10 million piculs of salt to Japan this year to supply Japanese industrial raw materials.

	On October 21, the Japanese gunboat No. 37 escorted six Japanese ships to Shanghai. The ship was designated by MacArthur to come to China.

	The Executive Yuan (Xing Zheng Yuan) decided to establish the Xing Zheng Yuan Water Transportation Brigade in mid-June, planning to lease 200,000 tons of ships from the U.S. to form it. Gu Weijun leased eight ships to Shanghai for the Xing Zheng Yuan. In addition to one-quarter carrying relief supplies, the rest carried commercial goods and passengers, undermining our shipping rights. On June 5, the Kuomintang National Defense Supreme Committee officially approved the proposal to allow foreign ships to berth at Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou to load and unload goods. When the U.S. sold 800 million in surplus materials to China, it was attached to a secret treaty of 30-year dockyard agreement, according to which China opened its coastal and inland waterway rights for 30 years. The Chiang government has also allowed U.S. ships to sail from Ryukyu to Taiwan and Keelung ports. In order to cooperate with the implementation of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, a large U.S. shipping company plans to dispatch more than 30 ships regularly to North China, Central China, South China, and Nanyang ports by the end of this year.

	On August 30, Chiang Kai-shek and Chennault signed a contract allowing Chennault to organize the Xing Zheng Yuan Air Transportation Brigade to fly in various parts of China. On September 2, the Chiang government signed an aircraft landing agreement between Shanghai and Manila with the U.S.-controlled Philippine government. On November 30, the Chiang government and the United States established another "Draft Sino-American Aviation Agreement." The draft stipulates that Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou will be the locations for loading and unloading international goods and mail. After the establishment of this agreement, the Chiang government will now spend a huge sum of 85 billion 500 million yuan in legal tender to expand Shanghai Longhua Airport for U.S. heavy aircraft to land. On December 20, the Chiang government signed the "Sino-American Aviation Agreement," which completely sold out China's airspace rights, and observation flights will begin soon. The official text of the treaty is even broader than the draft signed on the 30th of last month. It stipulates that "U.S. aircraft can load, unload, and transfer passengers and cargo not only in the previously designated locations such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, but also in locations agreed upon at any time in the future," and also stipulates that U.S. aircraft have the right to "non-traffic stopovers" within Chinese territory, which means that it also includes the right to land aircraft for military needs other than commercial purposes.

	Under the strong pressure of U.S. military and economic power, China's internal affairs are also gradually being controlled by U.S. imperialism.

	The "Sino-American Cooperation Organization," jointly run by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek, has long completely dominated the Kuomintang's police and secret service. On October 8, Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. signed the "Sino-American Police Joint Duty Protocol." On the same day, the "Sino-American Police Liaison Office" was established. China and the United States had already signed an agreement on the "Regulations on Criminal Cases of U.S. Military Personnel." In early November, the so-called "Sino-American Merchant Arbitration Association" was established, generally known as the "Public Judgment Committee" or "Arbitration Court," which is actually a disguised form of extraterritoriality. In October, the Shanghai District Court "refused to accept" cases accusing foreign staff of the Xing Zheng Yuan.

	During the negotiations in June, the Kuomintang government even proposed to give the United States the final decision-making power over China's internal affairs. Chiang Kai-shek even proposed a plan to hand over the entire "dispute zone" of China to the U.S. for trusteeship.

	The "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation" signed by the Chiang government and the United States on November 4 further consolidated all of the above-mentioned betrayals of China's sovereignty by Chiang Kai-shek in a "legal" form. The so-called equality and friendship of the treaty are completely deceptive. China does not have the necessary merchant fleet to exercise such rights, and China's investment in the United States is even more of a pipe dream. In fact, this is just a plan to accelerate the colonization of China and a concrete manifestation of the imperialist policy of making the Chinese nation forever slaves of the United States.

　　政协会议后的蒋介石卖国
    本报资料室
    美帝国主义积极助帮蒋介石进行内战，维持其买办封建的法西斯独裁统治，而加紧殖民地化中国的侵略，民贼独夫儿皇帝蒋介石对其主子美帝国主义，亦复是奉命唯谨，予取予求，极尽出卖国家主权利益之能事。
    海关自我国接收以来，蒋政府即委派美人李度任总税务司。六月初又派英人白礼查任江海关税务司。在各界反对出卖海关行政声中，蒋政府又把上海吴淞口外至铜沙之上海引水管理权转移与海关处理。
    四月间，新公司法正式颁布实行，给外国公司以特权。七月间，据统计华中已有十一家外国银行恢复营业，他们不仅要求经营通常的银行业务，而且要发行外国货币。到八月份，仅上海外商银行即达十三家，其资产达八百万万元，其存款达一百五十三万万余元。
    五月间，蒋政府许允美著名之“威斯汀好斯”电器厂在中国境内建立大规模之工厂。六月，又允许美及加拿大的“财”“才”“材”来华经营电力电器炼钢等事业。美并将包办三峡水力电厂。
    六月间，美国对外经济供应局，对华各部门投资十九万万元，大托拉斯环球公司已获得中国西北探测与采油权利，戈壁沙漠已有二十五井在开采中。七月，美电诺金属公司宣布他们的“合作”计划，依此计划，以日本原在东北及台湾之铝矿厂，及我国之铁矾土，或南美荷属圭亚那所产之高度铁矾土从事炼铝，并扩充设备。九月间，国民党资源委员会决定与美国铝业公司“合作”，美即将派专家视察山东及台湾两地日人遗留之轻金属工业。
    七月初陈纳德及中国买办官僚资本家们发起创办庞大之独占事业“中美实业公司”，总公司设于上海，并在南京、汉口、长沙、芜湖、九江、贵阳等地设立分公司。前驻华美空军十四航空队，向国民党政府要求将韶关（粤北，位于粤汉线上）邵阳（湘中，位于湘黔公路线上）两地辟工业区。闻国民党当局正与美方洽商详细办法中。
    七月间据统计自新公司法颁布后，美国公司商号在沪开设分支店者已达一百十五处，其中由美国总公司分设者有四十处，委托设立代办处者七十五处，大部分均系经营进出口业务。九月，美国大小工厂四百余家共同组织之“中美工商协运会”、现已推定代表十人，由美飞重庆转赴成都、昆明、西昌等地，作投资西南各省前之初步考察。自中美商约签订后，美国中美工商协会“已决定派商业考察团来华访问”。现美国已有二十余家现成工厂即将到达中国，这些工厂包括面粉厂，汽车装配厂、纱厂、水电厂以及仓库。
    九月间，美对粤汉路之投资总额为六千一百万美金，美占粤汉路总投资额的三分之二。十月，又传中美合办粤汉路，美愿贷美金五亿元。另外四川铁路将由美法合资建筑。
    “中美农业技术合作团”成立于六月，美侵略魔爪伸入中国广大农村。
    九月，蒋政府允许由台湾每月以水泥一千吨，木材八百吨，供给美军作岛屿布防。
    蒋政府与麦克阿瑟总部代表成立协定，准许日本海船四十艘，在中日间所谓“公海”——距海岸之海里以外，均可称为“公海”，实即中国沿海——捕鱼一年。六月闻息，蒋政府允许二千吨生铁输日。并以海州锦州之磷产供给日本，首批已于七月初起运，第二批于“八一三”开始起运。九月蒋政府向日本财阀订购五百辆火车头，三千辆车皮，日本财阀提出如下条件，即由中国输入六万吨铁块，和二十万五千吨上等焦煤。另外蒋政府又发表本年将以一千万石食盐运往日本，供日工业原料。
    十月二十一日有第三十七号日本炮舰一艘护送六艘日船驶沪，该轮系麦克阿瑟指定来华。
    行总决定在六月中成立行总水运大队，拟向美租借二十万吨船只组成。顾维钧替行总租借来沪之八艘船只，除四分之一载运救济物资外，余载运商货乘客，破坏我航权。六月五日国民党国防最高委员会正式通过准许外国轮船驶泊南京、芜湖、九江、汉口四埠装卸货物案。美在八亿剩余物资售华时，附有密约三十年船坞协定，依此协定，中国约开放沿海内河航权三十年。蒋政府并已允许美船自琉球驶入台湾与基隆两港。美某大轮船公司为配合中美商约之实施，预定于今年底派遣三十多艘船舶经常航行华北、华中、华南以及南洋各埠。
    八月卅日，蒋介石与陈纳德签订准许陈纳德组织行总空运大队，在中国各地飞行的合同。九月二日蒋政府又与美控制的菲律宾政府签订上海马尼剌间的飞机降落协定。十一月三十日蒋政府又与美国成立另一“中美航空协定草案”，草案规定天津、上海、广州三处为装卸国际货物邮件之地点。成立这一协定后，蒋政府现将花费八百五十万万法币的巨额经费，扩展上海龙华机场，以供美国重型飞机降落。十二月二十日蒋政府签订全面出卖中国领空权的“中美航空协定”，视察性之飞行，即将开始。该条约正式条文较上月三十日签定之草案内容尤为广泛。其中规定“美机除在已规定之上海、天津、广州等地点外，并可在以后随时同意之地点装卸和转运乘客、货物”，并规定美机在中国领土内亦有“非交通之停靠”权，这意味着商业性以外，作为军事需要的飞机降落权亦包括在内。
    在美国军事经济强大压力下，中国内政亦逐渐为美帝国主义所控制。
    美方与蒋介石合办之“中美合作所”，很久以来就完全统治了国民党的警察和特务。十月八日蒋美签订“中美警察联合勤务议定书”。同日，中美宪警联络室”成立。中美间老早便已签订关于“美军事人员刑事案件条例”协定。十一月初又成立所谓“中美商人仲裁会”，一般传为“公断委员会”，或“仲裁法庭”，实即变相领事裁判权。十月间上海地方法院“不予受理”控告行总外籍职员案件。
    在六月谈判中，国民党政府甚至提议把中国内政最后决定权也送给美国人。蒋介石甚至提出一个计划，拟将中国整个“纠纷区”交给美国托管。
    十一月四日蒋政府与美国签订的“中美友好通商航海条约”，更把上述一切蒋介石对中国主权的出卖，用“合法”的形式巩固起来。条约的所谓平等友好，完全是骗人的东西，中国并无实行此种权利必须的商船队，中国向美投资更是空话，事实上这只是一个加速中国殖民地化的方案，是使中华民族永远成为美国奴隶的帝国主义政策的具体化。
