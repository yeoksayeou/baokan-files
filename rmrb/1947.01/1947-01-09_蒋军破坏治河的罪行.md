The complete essence of the Kuomintang's malicious conspiracy over the past year to return the Yellow River to its old course has been: "Using the breaching of the Yellow River to coordinate with military offensives" and "Using military offensives to cover up the breaching of the Yellow River." The two go hand in hand, determined to flood and harm the seven million residents along the river in our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area. Therefore, although repeated river management agreements contain the explicit provision that "Yellow River projects shall not be affected by any military or political influences," the Kuomintang has never once implemented it.

After June, with the rapid progress of our area's dike restoration project, the Kuomintang, in order to undermine the smooth progress of our project, instructed the Chiang Kai-shek troops and puppet bandits stationed around the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area to send a large number of special agents to carry out large-scale sabotage of our area's river repair project.

First, they continuously destroyed the roads opened by our area for transporting river management materials. In order to facilitate the transportation of materials and food needed for river management, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office jointly decided with the Executive Relief and United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to build the Heze-Kaocheng and Heze-Shangqiu highways. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Highway Bureau then mobilized more than 2,000 people in late May to actively rush the construction. On June 1, when the Heze-Kaocheng highway was being built to Mengzhai, a part of the Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division, stationed in Mafang (20 miles northeast of Kaocheng), raided Caozhuang with more than 500 people, attacking the masses and militiamen repairing the road, causing serious injuries to two militiamen and minor injuries to more than 50 people repairing the road. Afterwards, they attacked continuously for five days, dispersing the road-repairing masses, making it impossible to quickly open the highway. On the Heze-Shangqiu road, the Kuomintang security regiments of Sun Xingzhai and Shi Fuqi, entrenched on both sides of the old Yellow River dike south of Cao County, also attacked our road-repairing workers three times in succession, injuring more than ten people.

Secondly, they instructed their troops to cooperate with puppet troops and sent out a large number of special agents to continuously attack our dike-repairing workers. In the Changyuan and Kaocheng area: On June 8, the Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division, stationed in Kaocheng, under the pretext of establishing a defense office, invaded our area and set up strongholds in Yantan, preventing the masses from starting work to repair the dike. On the same day, the puppet Third District Team entrenched in the county also窜 (窜: Fled, escaped. Implies bandit/criminal nature) to eight villages including Da and Xiao Huangzhuang in our area, capturing eight village chiefs, and threatening the masses, saying: "Whoever repairs the dike for the Eighth Route Army will have their whole family killed, leaving no chickens or dogs alive." In the week from the 14th to the 20th, the 74th Division and the puppet Third District Team launched as many as nine attacks, going to 28 villages including Guotang, Zhu'ao, and Daizhai in our area, capturing 13 village chiefs and dike-repairing masses, and taking away all the food and firewood of the dike-repairing workers. On the 23rd and 25th, the 74th Division launched a large-scale offensive against our dike-repairing workers, twice firing intensively with more than ten machine guns, killing 12 militiamen and masses in our Fifth District, and capturing seven laborers.

What is most hateful is that special agents specially dispatched from Jinan to sabotage our dike-repairing project, ambushed in Xixiaoyanzhuang on June 14, and killed all six cadres, including Zhang Xingnong, the section chief of the Changqing defense section. They were hacked and stabbed with kitchen knives and sickles until their tendons were broken and their bones were shattered, and their flesh was blurred with blood. On July 13, they surrounded the Fifth Engineering Team of the Hexi Defense Section in Guanzhuang, killing one person, injuring two, and capturing nine people including Lin Tingxue, the instructor of the engineering team.

In this way, the 40-mile dike near Changqing and close to the Chiang-occupied area, and the 25-mile embankment from Huangji (west of Kaocheng) to Yantan, could not be repaired due to the attacks and sabotage by the Chiang Kai-shek troops.

Chiang Kai-shek troops and special agents in Jinan even more boldly illegally expelled Liu Jiqing, the river management representative of the Bohai District, on June 10 at noon, and seized a jeep, two sets of instruments, and more than 20 other tools allocated by the Yellow River Commission for river management.

In early August, after the Kuomintang launched a large-scale civil war against our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area on the Longhai Railway line, the Heze-Kaocheng and Heze-Shangqiu highways were completely blocked by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, prohibiting all river management materials from being transported into our area, and any supply was completely cut off. At the same time, American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes also flew into the airspace of the Liberated Area continuously from this time, indiscriminately strafing the dike-repairing workers and river management agencies along the river. They destroyed three jeeps of our Yellow River Commission one after another, and injured more than ten dike workers in the engineering section from Jiangsu Dam to Batou.

After the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Heze, Juancheng, and Dongming counties, they spared no effort to destroy our river works. They dug trenches and built fortifications everywhere on the dikes on both sides of the river, greatly damaging the dikes that our area's masses had painstakingly repaired this summer. In particular, the dike from Juancheng Old City Ji to Puyang Batou was severely damaged, and more than half of it was already dilapidated and useless.

Our river management materials were repeatedly looted by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, resulting in huge losses. The Fourth Defense Section alone stored in Heze, Cao County, and Dongming area, preparing for the material and work to repair the dangerous project, was robbed of more than two million catties of flour, 490,000 catties of hemp rope, 192,000 sacks, two million catties of straw, 70,000 wooden piles, 30 barrels of gasoline and engine oil, and other materials. As a result, the dangerous projects in our area could not be started at all. In addition, all ships owned by the people were burned to the ground wherever the Chiang Kai-shek troops went.

All this proves that the Kuomintang is determined to destroy our river management project and put the seven million residents along the river downstream to death. And such extensive use of troops and special agents, destroying, killing, and robbing everywhere, will make us very clearly realize Chiang Kai-shek's poisonous plan of coordinating river blockage and military offensives. The Kuomintang's widely touted "river management is not affected by any military or political influence" is essentially this.

    蒋军破坏治河的罪行
    西民
    “以黄河堵口来配合军事进攻”，“以军事进攻来掩护黄河堵口”，二者相辅并进，决心来淹害我冀鲁豫解放区沿河七百万居民，这就是一年来国民党对于黄河归故的恶毒阴谋的全部实质。因此，虽然在屡次的治河协议中，均载有“黄河工程不受任何军事政治影响”的明文规定，但是，国民党却从来也没有一次执行过。
    六月以后，随着我区复堤工程的迅速开展，国民党为了破坏我方工程顺利进行，便指使冀鲁豫区周围驻屯的蒋军伪匪，派遣大批特务，对我区的修河工程展开了大规模的破坏。
    首先，是接连破坏我区修筑为运输治河物资而开的公路。为便利运输治河所需之器材工粮，冀鲁豫行署曾与行总、联总共同商定，修筑荷（泽）考（城）、荷（泽）商（邱）两公路。冀鲁豫公路局乃于五月下旬，特发动群众两千余人积极赶修。六月一日，当荷考公路修至孟寨时，驻马房（考城东北二十里）之蒋军七十四旅一部五百余人，竟窜至曹庄大举袭击我修路之群众及民兵，致民兵二人负重伤，修路群众轻伤者在五十名以上。以后，并接连袭击五日，将修路群众赶散，使公路不能迅速修通。在荷商路上，盘据曹县城南黄河旧大堤两侧之国民党保安团孙性斋、石复起等部，亦先后三次袭击我修路工人，打伤群众十余名。
    其次，是指使其军队配合伪军，并派出大批特务，连续袭击我修堤工人。在长垣、考城一带：六月八日，驻考城之蒋军七十四旅以设修防处为名，侵入我区阎潭按设据点，阻止群众动工修堤。同日，盘据该县之伪三区队，亦窜至我区大小黄庄等八个村庄，捕走村长八人，并恐吓群众说：“谁给八路军修堤，杀他全家鸡犬不留”。从十四日至廿日的一周内，七十四旅及伪三区队即连续出袭达九次之多，到我区郭堂、朱凹、代砦等二十八村，捕走村长及修堤群众十三人，将修堤工人的吃食与烧柴全部抢去。二十三、二十五两日，七十四旅更向我修堤工人发动大规模的进攻，两次以十余挺机枪密集扫射，打死我五区民兵及群众十二人，抓去民夫七名。
    最使人痛恨的是，由济南专门派出破坏我修堤工程的特务，于六月十四日，在西小燕庄潜伏，将我长清修防段段长张兴农等全体干部六人全部杀害，并以菜刀、镰刀乱砍乱刺，直至筋断骨碎，血肉模糊。七月十三日，复在官庄包围我河西修防段第五工程中队，打死一人，打伤二人，抓走工程队指导员林廷学等九名。
    这样，在长清附近与蒋占区接近处之四十里大堤，及由黄集（考城西）至阎潭一段之二十五里堤岸，便因蒋军之袭击破坏而无法修补。
    济南蒋军及特务分子，则更大胆地竟于六月十日正午，将渤海区治河代表刘季青非法驱逐出境，将黄委会拨付之治河器材吉普车一辆，仪器两套及其他工具二十余件，一并抢去。
    八月初，国民党在陇海线向我冀鲁豫解放区发动大规模内战后，荷考、荷商两公路便被蒋军完全封锁，禁止一切治河物资运入我区，任何供应遂完全断绝。同时，美制蒋机从此时起，亦连续不断飞入解放区上空，大肆扫射沿河修堤工人及治河机关。先后击毁我黄委会吉普车三辆，在江苏坝至坝头之工段上，打伤堤工达十余人之多。
    蒋军侵占荷泽，鄄城及东明等县后，对我河工破坏更不遗余力。在两岸大堤上到处挖战壕，修工事，将今夏我区群众历尽艰苦所修补好的堤岸大加破坏，特别是由鄄城旧城集至濮阳坝头间之大堤，破坏的尤为厉害，半数以上均已残破不堪，成为无用。
    我治河物资，被蒋军一再抢劫，损失巨大。仅第四修防处存放在荷泽、曹县、东明一带的准备修险工的工料，就被抢去面粉二百余万斤，麻绳四十九万斤，麻袋十九万二千条，秸料二百万斤，木桩七万根，汽油、机油三十桶，以及其他物资。因之，使我区的险工根本无法动工修筑。另外，蒋军所到之处，民间所有船只，都被焚毁一空。
    凡此种种，无一不证明国民党决心破坏我治河工程，置我下游沿河七百万居民于死地。而如此尽量使用军队和特务，到处破坏、杀人、抢劫，更会使我们很明白的认识，蒋介石以堵河和军事进攻互相配合的毒计。国民党大肆吹嘘的“治河不受任何军事政治影响”及其实质就是这样。
