    The Jilu-Yu Front achieved successive victories.
    Our army recovered Dingtao and Nanle.
    More than a thousand enemy troops defending Dingtao were completely annihilated.
    [Report from the Jilu-Yu Front, January 26th] The People's Liberation Army under General Liu Bocheng recaptured Dingtao city at dusk on the 24th. After two hours of fighting, more than a thousand enemy troops defending the city were completely annihilated. The results of the battle are still being tallied.
    [Report from the Jilu-Yu Front, January 26th] On the 23rd, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army recovered Nanle city. On the 14th of this month, after our army completed its mission of blocking Chiang's troops, it withdrew from the city. The 23rd Brigade of Chiang's 85th Division then sneaked into the city. For ten days, it was constantly besieged and attacked by our army and local militia guerrillas. The enemy was uneasy and feared annihilation. On the 23rd, they fled in panic to the west. Nanle city was thus liberated. Our army is now pursuing the enemy in victory. Our democratic government has entered the city to restore order and carry out relief and comfort work.
    [Report from the Jilu-Yu Front, January 25th] During the battle of Xitaiji in Dingtao, Hou Huaitang, the squad leader of the heavy machine gun squad of the 543rd Regiment of Chiang's 181st Brigade, after being persuaded by our loudspeaker appeals, led his squad of eleven men to lay down their weapons. He then returned to the front line and persuaded four Chiang soldiers to surrender to our army. Squad Leader Hou is from Linqing, Shandong. In 1938, he was doing small business in Zhecheng, Henan, when he was captured by the 69th Army (now the 181st Brigade) and forced into military service, losing contact with his family. Last month, he met a fellow villager in Heze and learned that his hometown had become a liberated area, and that the land in his home had increased from nineteen mu to thirty mu, and that his life was getting richer and richer. After hearing the news, he asked his superiors for leave to go home four times, but was not approved, so he prepared to escape. During this battle, the officers repeatedly threatened him with "the Eighth Route Army buries prisoners alive," and he hesitated. After being persuaded by our army's loudspeaker appeals, he finally made up his mind to surrender. After laying down his weapons, the Eighth Route Army treated him like a brother, and he thoroughly saw through the deception of the Chiang army officers and was determined to perform meritorious service for the people. At that time, the battle was in full swing, and he voluntarily asked to return to the front line to speak, and won over four more Chiang soldiers to come to our army's position.

    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十六日电】刘伯承将军所部人民解放军于二十四日黄昏克复定陶城，经两小时战斗，守敌千余全部被歼，战果正清查中。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十六日电】二十三日，八路军某部收复南乐城。本月十四日，我军于完成阻击蒋军任务后撤出该城，蒋军八十五师二十三旅即窜入该城，十日来不断遭受我军及地方民兵游击队围困袭击，敌人坐卧不安，恐被歼灭，乃于二十三日仓皇突围西窜，南乐城当告光复，现我军正乘胜对该敌追击中。我民主政府已入城恢复秩序，进行救济及安抚工作。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五日电】定陶西台集战斗中，蒋军一八一旅五四三团重机枪连六班班长侯怀堂经我喊话争取，率该班十一人放下武器，并即回到火线上争取了蒋军四名向我军投诚。侯班长系山东临清人，民国二十七年在河南柘城做小买卖，被六十九军（即现一八一旅）抓去当兵，即与家中断绝音信，上月在荷泽遇见同村人，得知家乡已成为解放区，自己家中的土地已由十九亩增加到三十亩，生活日益富裕，闻信后曾向长官请假回家，四次均未批准，乃准备逃跑。此次战斗中，官长屡以“八路军活埋俘虏”相威吓，他又曾发生犹豫，经我军喊话争取，终于下了投诚的决心。放下武器后，八路军待之如兄弟，始彻底识破蒋军军官之欺骗，决心为人民立功。当时战斗正酣，他自动要求回到火线上去喊话，又争取了四名蒋军到我军阵地上来。
