Chiang Kai-shek Dialogue
A Proposed "Humorous Skit"
Ping

It is said that after Chiang Kai-shek suffered a crushing defeat in attacking the liberated areas, he had a terrible headache and went to his old friend, Hitler's grave, to ask for instructions:

"Master Hitler! This disciple has been trying to eliminate the 'bandit army,' but as a result, my many direct descendants have been eliminated by the bandit army. May I ask you to impart some wonderful methods!"

"But I don't know which part you are referring to as the 'bandit army'?"

"The Communist Party!"

"Ah!" Hitler screamed sharply, trembled for a long time before calming down, and asked:

"Brother Chiang, how does my ability compare to yours?"

"Of course, it's much better!"

"Then what do you think my result was?" Old Hitler said with a mournful face.

"That… Master! I have a godfather to support me!"

"But your godfather may not be as capable as I am!" Old Hitler said self-importantly.

"No! I still have US dollars and cannons as betting capital. I wonder what secrets you have that will allow me to keep going to the end."

"I do have secrets, but I don't know if you want to do it?"

"Do it! Do it! Do it!" Old Chiang laughed madly, opening his toothless mouth with joy.

"When you can't fight anymore, please come here for a moment."

"At that time, Master will definitely help me!"

"That's natural! I will have to use all my strength to help you dig a good place next to me, just waiting for you to keep me company."

"Ouch!" Chiang shook his big egg-like bald head and ran away from the tomb like crazy, breaking out in a cold sweat.

　　蒋希对话
    拟“幽默小品”
    萍
    话说蒋介石在进攻解放区吃大败仗后，头痛得很，便到他的老友——希特拉墓前去请示：
    “希翁老师傅！弟子老想消灭‘匪军’，结果反被匪军消灭我许多嫡系，敢请传授妙法！”
    “但不知您所说的‘匪军’是指那一部分？”
    “共产党！”
    “啊呀！”希特拉猛的惨叫一声，颤栗半天后才平静下来，问道：
    “蒋家老弟，我比您的本领如何？”
    “当然是高明得多咧！”
    “那么您看我的结果如何？”老希哭丧着脸说。
    “那……老师！我有干爹爹撑腰哩！”
    “可是你干爹爹未必有我能耐大！”老希很自负地说。
    “不行！我还有的是美金和大炮作赌本，不知您有什么秘诀，使我能干到底。”
    “秘诀倒有，不知您干不干？”
    “干！干！干！”老蒋喜得张开没牙大嘴狂笑起来。
    “您在打得没办法的时候，请来我这里一下。”
    “那时老师傅一定会帮我的忙！”
    “那是自不然的！我要费九牛二虎之力，在我身旁帮您挖一个好地方，单等您来做伴。”
    “唔呀！”蒋摇着大鸡蛋般的秃头，发疯似地从墓前跑开，出了一身冷汗。
