　　Literary Criticism Becomes Active!
　　After reading Comrade Zhdanov's "Report on the Errors of the Magazines 'Star' and 'Leningrad'," I couldn't help but have some thoughts.
　　Similar errors have occurred in China as well, but thanks to Chairman Mao's brilliant and timely correction in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," which clarified the class nature of literature and art, emphasized the guiding role of politics, and transformed a group of writers, not only have such errors been basically overcome in the liberated areas, but also rich fruits have been produced in drama, woodcuts, novels, and poetry. This report makes us realize the ideological principles of literature and art once again. Not only should cultural workers study it carefully, but even general revolutionary workers can learn a lot from it—especially how to adhere to principles and improve work in various departments.
　　However, the more practical significance of this report for us is that it warns us: "Where there is no criticism, decay and stagnation will take root." If we want to avoid errors in literary and artistic and general ideological propaganda work, maintain health, and produce higher quality and more abundant works, we must strengthen criticism.
　　The word "criticism" is bound to cause fear. The criticized tend to think of it as fault-finding or attack, and the critics inevitably think about whether they will offend others. Under these two fears, they have to take an easy path—that is: no criticism or very little criticism. Is this path correct? Zhdanov said very clearly: "For writers, this is the same as for other staff members. Anyone who is afraid of criticizing their own work is a despicable coward, and he is not worthy of the respect of the people." And "from the point of view of similar staff, in order not to offend people, it is best not to take care of the interests of the people and the interests of the country. This is completely incorrect and a politically wrong thing. This is equivalent to exchanging one million yuan for a copper plate."
　　Moreover, criticism is not just about pointing out mistakes and attacking, but more importantly, it also has the aspect of promoting advantages. "Strict criticism must be given to all literary and artistic works containing anti-national, anti-scientific, anti-popular, and anti-communist viewpoints." Corrupt and poisonous petty-bourgeois viewpoints like those of Zoshchenko should naturally be deeply hated and strictly dealt with; but in today's people's literary world in the liberated areas, the more important thing is to discover outstanding works and writers, and to encourage and cultivate more literary and artistic workers to blossom and bear fruit by praising excellent and successful works. In order to complete this task well, the defects in the works of established writers who have achieved some success should not be abandoned, because many young people are learning from these works, and without appropriate criticism, errors will be transmitted, and the learning will become worse and worse.
　　Another problem with no criticism and very little criticism is that people don't speak face-to-face, but talk nonsense behind their backs, resulting in nitpicking and losing the principles and standards of literary criticism, and ultimately they will inevitably lose unity.
　　In order to make our literature and art have stronger ideological principles, political standards, and artistic standards, and to further refine them, in order to concretize Chairman Mao's thoughts on literary and art issues into daily work, I hope this report can stimulate and activate our literary criticism.

### 文艺批评活跃起来！

　　文艺批评活跃起来！
    读了日丹诺夫同志《关于〈星〉及〈列宁格勒〉杂志所犯错误的报告》，不禁发生一些感想。
    类似的错误，在中国也曾发生过，但由于毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》那样光辉而及时的指正，明确了文艺的阶级性，强调了政治的指导作用，改造了一批作家，在解放区不仅基本上已经克服了这类错误，而且无论在戏剧、木刻、小说、诗歌上都有了肥美的果实。这篇报告使我们对文艺的思想原则性再一遍明确地认识，不仅文化工作者应当精读，就是一般革命工作者，也可以从里面学到许多，——特别是如何在各部门的事业中坚持原则，改善工作的方面。
    但是，这篇报告对我们的更实际的意义是，它警惕我们：“那里没有批评，那里的腐朽和停滞就会生起根来。”要想在文学艺术及一般思想宣传工作中避免错误，经常保持健康，产生质量更高更丰美的作品，就必须加强批评。
    一提起“批评”二字，未免惹人骇怕，受批评者总易把它想做挑剔或打击，批评者总难免想到是否得罪人。在这样两怕之下，就只好躲上一条容易的道路——即：没有批评或者批评很少。这条路对不对呢？日丹诺夫说得很清楚：“对于文学家们，这一点对其他的工作人员是一样的，谁要是害怕批评自己的工作，谁就是遭人卑视的懦夫，他就不配受到人民的尊敬。”而“从类似的工作人员的观点来看，为了不得罪人，最好还是不去照顾人民的利益和国家的利益，这是一件完全不正确的，政治上犯错误的事情。这就等于用一百万元去换一个铜板”。
    何况批评也不尽是指摘、打击，更重要的还有发扬优点的一面。“对于一切包含反民族、反科学、反大众、反共的观点的文艺作品，必须给以严格的批评”，对腐朽有毒的小资产阶级的观点如左勤科之流，自然应当是深恶痛绝，严予处理；但在今天的解放区的人民文坛上，更要紧的事情，还在于发现优秀的作品和作家，用表扬优秀成功之作来鼓励培植更多的文艺工作者开花结果。而为了好好完成这一任务，对稍有成就的成名作家的作品中的缺陷，也是不应放弃指正的，因为许多青年正在向这些作品学习，没有适当的批评就会以讹传讹，越学越差。
    没有批评和很少批评的另一毛病就是当面不说，背后乱说，结果吹毛求疵失掉了文艺批评的原则和标准，最终也一定要失去团结。
    为了使我们的文艺具有更强的思想原则性，政治标准和艺术标准，都更臻于化境，为了把毛主席对文艺问题的思想具体化到日常工作中，我希望这篇报告能刺激并活跃起我们的文艺批评来。
