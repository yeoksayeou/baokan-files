　　Controlling 40 Li of the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 12th】 The southern section of the Tongpu Railway, which was seized by Yan (Xishan) and Hu (Zongnan)'s troops at a heavy cost, had another 40 li (between Linfen and Houma) recovered by the Taiyue Eighth Route Army of the People's Liberation Army at the beginning of the month. After the victory in Yicheng, our army advanced along the Tongpu line in two routes. On the 6th, the first route of troops entered the area north of Quwo. The Yan army's defending troops fled upon hearing the news, and Gaoxian and Mengcheng were recovered by us. After clearing the outer strongholds of villages and towns in southern Linfen, the second route of troops launched a general attack on the town on the 7th. The entire first battalion of the 39th division of the Yan army was annihilated. The regimental headquarters and the third battalion of the regiment attempted to break through and escape, and fierce fighting broke out with the blocking troops. The third battalion of the regiment was again largely annihilated, and the town and station of Shicun were recovered on the 8th. In this battle, more than 400 Yan soldiers were captured alive, more than 50 were killed or wounded, and 250 rifles, 15 light machine guns, ammunition and other weapons were seized.
