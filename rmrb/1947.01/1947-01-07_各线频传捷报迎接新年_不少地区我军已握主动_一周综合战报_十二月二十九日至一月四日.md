Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: The People's Liberation Army on all fronts welcomed the arrival of the 36th year of the Republic of China with brilliant victories. The frequent good news signifies the growth of the People's Liberation Army's strength and its commencement of seizing the initiative in several regions.

In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, General Liu Bocheng's troops entered the four county seats of Liaocheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, and Yicheng on New Year's Day alone. In the Battle of Juye alone, over 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, including Zhang Lanfeng's troops, were captured alive. In the battle near Jinxiang, over 1,200 Chiang Kai-shek troops from the 21st Brigade of the 88th Division were killed or captured. As Chiang Kai-shek's troops, advancing on the Ji'nan area in northern Henan and western Shandong, are becoming increasingly bogged down, the Eighth Route Army on this line took the initiative to withdraw from the city of Daming on the morning of the 1st.

In Shandong, the Lunan New Fourth Army launched a swift counterattack on the evening of the 2nd against Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupying Xiangcheng, Bianzhuang, and the Lanling line, 70 li southwest of Linyi. The entire headquarters of Chiang Kai-shek's 26th Division and its 44th Brigade were wiped out. The 169th Brigade of the division and the 80th Brigade of the 28th Division were also largely destroyed. The New Fourth Army took over 9,000 prisoners alone. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to attack Linyi suffered a severe blow.

In southwestern Shanxi, Hu Zongnan's five American-equipped brigades advanced from Linfen and Jixian in three routes, attempting to窥视 (to peek) at Xixian Yonghe to threaten the eastern flank of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The Eighth Route Army in the area blocked them on the 24th and 25th of last month in the northeast of Wucheng and at Heilongguan, a strategic point between Puxian and Linfen, killing or capturing 1,500 troops below the rank of the Chief of the Quartermaster Department of the First Division. On the 30th, they annihilated the entire 200th Regiment and one battalion of the 199th Regiment directly under the 67th Brigade between Puxian and Wucheng, capturing alive 1,700 troops below the rank of Deputy Brigade Commander Chen Chengwu, and killing or wounding over 500 troops below the rank of 200th Regiment Commander Jiang Changtai.

In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia area, Hu Zongnan's troops, with four brigades as the vanguard, launched a seven-pronged attack on Malan City in the Guanzhong sub-region on the southern line of Yan'an on the 30th of last month, briefly intruding 40 to 50 li into the border area, forcibly occupying Changshetou, 60 li northwest of Malan, and Yangjiadianzi, 60 li northeast, and continuing to expand to both sides. They were met with vigorous resistance from the local army and people, and their offensive has been stalled.

    不少地区我军已握主动
    一周综合战报
    十二月二十九日至一月四日
    【新华社延安五日电】各线人民解放军以辉煌战绩迎接民国三十六年的到来，频传的捷报标志着人民解放军力量的壮大，及在若干地区开始掌握主动。
    晋冀鲁豫方面刘伯承将军所部于元旦一日中进驻聊城、钜野、嘉祥、翼城四座县城，仅钜野之役即生俘蒋伪军张岚峰等部三千余人，在金乡城附近之战中，复俘毙蒋军八十八师二十一旅所部一千二百余人，由于豫北及鲁西分路进犯冀南地区之蒋军正愈陷愈深，该线八路军已于一日上午主动撤离大名城。
    山东方面，鲁南新四军于二日晚以迅雷之势向侵占临沂西南七十里之向城、卞庄及兰陵一线之蒋军实行自卫反击，蒋军二十六师师部及所属四十四旅全部就歼，该师一六九旅及二十八师之八十旅亦大部覆没，新四军仅收容俘虏即达九千余人，蒋军进攻临沂企图受到了严重打击。
    晋西南方面，胡宗南部五个美械旅由临汾、吉县分三路出犯，企图进窥隰县永和，以威胁陕甘宁边区的东翼。该地八路军于上月二十四、二十五两日在午城东北地区及蒲县临汾间之要隘黑龙关分予阻击，毙俘其第一师军需处长以下一千五百余人，复于三十日在蒲县午城间聚歼其六十七旅旅直属所属二百团全部与一九九团一个营，生俘该旅副旅长陈诚武以下一千七百余人，另毙伤二百团团长姜常泰以下五百余人。
    陕甘宁方面，胡宗南部于上月三十日以四个旅为先导，分七路合击延安南线关中分区的马栏市，一度侵入边境四五十里，强占马栏西北六十里长舌头及东北六十里杨家店子等地，并继续向两侧扩张，遭当地军民奋力抗击，其攻势已受阻遏。
