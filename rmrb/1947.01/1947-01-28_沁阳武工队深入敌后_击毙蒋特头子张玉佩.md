    Qinyang Guerrilla Unit Penetrates Enemy Lines
    Kills Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Zhang Yupei
    [Our Newspaper] The Qinyang Guerrilla Unit penetrated deep behind enemy lines and killed Zhang Yupei, the head of the special agents in Wen County and Qinyang County. Zhang was from Zhang Village, Fifth District of Qinyang. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as a spy investigator in the Police Department of the Henan Provincial Government. After 1938, he was sent by the Kuomintang to Zhengzhou, where he had close ties with the enemy and engaged extensively in anti-communist activities in collaboration with the Japanese. When the Japanese devils surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organ specially sent him to Qinyang to organize "post-war affairs," specifically framing progressive youths, resulting in the deaths of Zhao Ziguang and eleven others. After the Eighth Route Army liberated Qinyang City, he fled to Xinxiang. Last October, when the Chiang Kai-shek army invaded and occupied Qinyang, Zhang returned to the city with the Chiang Kai-shek army and was appointed as the special agent in charge of Wen (County) and Qin (yang) counties. From then on, Zhang openly and blatantly deployed special agent work everywhere to harm young people. In early December, Zhang returned home to "visit relatives." A detachment of our guerrilla unit took the opportunity to enter Zhang Village and surround Zhang's gate. His wife saw the guerrillas in the yard and hurriedly turned around to report. Zhang was terrified, put on his clothes, jumped over the wall and ran away, but was caught by our village sentry outside. A cipher telegram, eight special agent certificates, and a special agent organization system chart were found on his person. In order to protect the lives and freedom of the vast number of young people in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied area, our guerrilla unit immediately executed Zhang at his gate.

    沁阳武工队深入敌后
    击毙蒋特头子张玉佩
    【本报讯】沁阳武工队深入敌后，打死温、沁两县特务头子张玉佩。张是沁阳五区张村人，抗战前在河南省政府警察厅任谍查职。三八年后，被国民党派往郑州与敌往还甚密，大作其联日反共勾当。日寇投降时，蒋记特务机关特派他到沁阳整理“善后”，专门陷害进步青年，先后害死赵子光等十一人；俟八路军光复沁阳城后逃往新乡。去年十月，蒋军侵陷沁阳，张逆复随蒋军进城；并受委为温（县）沁（阳）两县特务负责人。从此，张逆明目张胆，到处布置残害青年的特务工作。十二月初，张逆回家“省亲”，我武工队某支队趁机进入张村，包围住张逆大门。他老婆在院里看见是游击队，急忙回头报告。张逆胆战心惊，披衣跳墙就跑，当被我村外哨兵捉住。从身上搜出密码电稿一件，特务证八个，特务组织系统表一张。我武工队为保护蒋军侵占区内广大青年的生命与自由，当即将张逆枪决于其大门口。
