Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: According to a Wenhui Bao report from the 20th of last month, over ten thousand middle school and university students in Taipei City, Taiwan, demonstrated on the 20th of last month, protesting the unreasonable verdict in the Shibuya Incident. In that verdict, 37 of our Taiwanese compatriots were sentenced to two or three years in prison by the U.S. Military Court in Japan. The demonstration shouted slogans such as "Revoke the original verdict and release the arrested Taiwanese compatriots" and "Arrest the Japanese murderers who massacred four Taiwanese compatriots." This was the first magnificent roar of the Taiwanese youth in over fifty years. They demanded the elimination of fascist remnants and called for a fair trial. The demonstration procession stretched for miles. The Shibuya Incident occurred around July of last year. Taiwanese compatriots from the Jingqiao area of Tokyo, who were engaged in business, were brutally beaten by dozens of Japanese ruffians. Afterwards, our Taiwanese stallholders protested to the Kuomintang government's representative in Tokyo, and were shot and killed by Japanese police, resulting in over twenty deaths and injuries. The U.S. military then detained many of our Taiwanese compatriots. This caused protests from people's organizations in Jinghu (Nanjing and Shanghai) and Taiwan, demanding that the Nanjing government protect overseas Chinese, but the Nanjing government ignored them, resulting in our Taiwanese compatriots suffering such dark and unreasonable "sentencing" by the U.S. Military Court.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao of the 9th, from Changsha: The Student Union of National Hunan University, regarding the incident of a Peking University female student being insulted by U.S. soldiers, telegraphed the Peking University Student Committee Protesting U.S. Military Atrocities, expressing their support; and sent a telegram to U.S. Ambassador Stuart, lodging a serious protest and demanding a reasonable solution. According to the same day's Ta Kung Pao: The Kuomintang authorities in Changsha, in order to suppress the patriotic and democratic student movement, are strengthening their special agent terror tactics in various schools. In the past week, one student from Dui Ze Middle School has "disappeared." First Normal School and other schools have been repeatedly threatened with arson by special agents. Gunshots are heard in various schools at night, causing several scares each night, leaving over forty thousand students in Changsha in a terrifying atmosphere, unable to study peacefully. Students from various schools have expressed deep indignation about this.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Beiping (Beijing): On the 9th, Tianjin Ta Kung Pao published a commentary on the current patriotic student movement, stating: This is not a small incident that happened by chance; it actually contains a major issue facing China today. Just listen to the young people's shouts demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops, and you can understand this point. The newspaper pointed out that the Kuomintang government's foreign policy places the United States in the first position. In addition, the lack of domestic unity has resulted in the country being in a mess both internally and externally. The newspaper believes that China's correct foreign policy today should first demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. As long as the U.S. troops leave, all disputes will naturally be easily resolved.

　　抗议驻日美军法庭无理判处台胞徒刑
    台湾学生万人示威
    长沙学生继起声援抗议美军暴行运动
    天津大公报亦著论主张美军退出中国
    【新华社延安十三日电】据文汇报上月二十日载，台湾台北市大中学生万余人于上月二十日游行示威，抗议涩谷事件之无理判决。在该判决中，我台胞三十七人被驻日美国军事法庭判处两年或三年的徒刑。示威队伍高呼“撤消原判，释放被捕台胞”，“逮捕惨杀台胞四人的日本凶手”，此为台湾青年五十余年来第一次雄壮的怒吼，他们要求清除法西斯残余分子，要求公正的裁判。示威队伍浩荡长达里许。按涩谷事件发生于去年七月间，住在东京京桥一带营商的我台湾同胞惨遭数十日本浪人殴打，事后我摊贩台胞向国民党政府驻东京代表示威抗议，遭日警察开枪射杀，死伤二十余人，该地美军又将我台胞多人扣留。当时曾引起京沪及台湾等地人民团体的抗议，要求南京政府保护侨民，但被南京政府置之不理，以致我台胞遭受美军事法庭如此黑暗无理的所谓“判处”。
    【新华社延安十四日电】据九日天津大公报长沙讯：国立湖南大学学生自治会为北大女生被美军污辱事项、通电北大学生抗议美军暴行委员会，表示声援；并致电美大使司徒提出严重抗议，要求合理解决。据同日大公报讯：长沙国民党当局为镇压学生爱国民主运动，正加强其在各学校中的特务恐怖。一周来，兑泽中学一学生已“失踪”，省立一中、格怡工校、第一师范等校均连续被特务纵火威吓，夜半各校时闻冷枪，一夕数惊，使长沙四万余学生处恐怖氛围中，无法安心学业。各校学生对此深表愤慨。
    【新华社延安十四日电】北平讯：九日天津大公报就此次学生爱国运动发表评论称：这不是一件偶然发生的小事，其中实包藏着当前中国的一个大问题，只要听听青年群众要求撤退美军的呼喊，就可了解此点。该报指出，国民党政府的外交政策是把美国置于第一位。加之国内团结有缺憾，乃使国家里里外外都不成个局面。该报认为中国今日的正确外交政策，首先应要求美军退出中国，只要美军归去，则一切纠纷自易解决。
