[Our Newspaper Weixian Seventeenth Electric] The masses' leader in Beijili Village, Zaoqiang, shattered the conspiracy of a local tyrant landlord to buy people off. The local tyrant landlord, Wang Tongshu, said to his wife, "Give money secretly to the activists to lessen our crimes." His wife immediately took 14,000 yuan. She first went to the home of Da Chou, an activist, and said to his wife, "Do you have enough to eat this year? See how hard the poor life is!" Then she put down 8,000 yuan and ran away. She also went to the home of Wang Qingshan, the head of the Farmers' Association's organization department, and after talking for a long time, put down 6,000 yuan and left. That evening, Da Chou and Wang Qingshan each returned home and learned about this. After dinner, they each took the money to a mass meeting, exposed the conspiracy, and said, "No amount of money can buy my heart. I will always stand with everyone." After they finished speaking, the masses shouted, "Down with the evil tyrant who tries to buy people's hearts! Resolutely support the people's leaders!" From then on, the masses' courage to struggle became even stronger.

    【本报威县十七日电】枣强北吉里群众领袖粉碎恶霸地主收买阴谋。恶霸地主王通书，对他老婆说：“给积极分子暗钱，买轻咱的罪状。”他老婆当即拿了一万四千元，首先到了积极分子大臭家，向他老婆说：“你今年够吃的吗？你看穷日子多么难过呀！”随拿出八千元放下就跑。又到农会组织部长王庆山家，也说了半天后，拿出六千元放下就走了。晚上大臭与王庆山都各自回家，知道了这事。他二人晚饭后，各人拿着那些钱到群众会上，揭破其阴谋，并说：“他多少钱也买不动我的心，我永远和大家站在一起”。说罢群众便高呼：“打倒买弄人心的恶霸！坚决拥护人民的领袖！”从此群众斗争勇气更加上劲了。
