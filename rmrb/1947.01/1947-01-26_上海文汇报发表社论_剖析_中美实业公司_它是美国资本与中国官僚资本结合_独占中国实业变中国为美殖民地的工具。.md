Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th. According to an editorial in the Shanghai liberal newspaper Wenhui Bao on the 10th of this month, the "Sino-American Industrial Company" chaired by American Chennault will become the American "East India Company" in China. The newspaper first stated that its reporter recently visited the person in charge of the company and learned: (1) In addition to senior officials of the "Central Government," prominent figures from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, and other provinces are also participating in the Sino-American Industrial Company. (2) Chennault is one of the managing directors of the company. (3) The company has established branches in Changsha, Hengyang, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and other places, and will add more as needed. (4) The Executive Yuan has approved it. The newspaper then stated: "This company is undoubtedly dominated by American capital, creating a trend for American capital to combine with Chinese bureaucratic capital to monopolize Chinese industry." The newspaper pointed out: It is said that the main business of the Sino-American Company is currently import and export trade, including all materials needed by the United States to be exported from China, such as tea, bristles, wool, tung oil, etc., as well as materials needed by China to be imported from the United States, such as machinery, medicines, and all daily necessities, all purchased by the company. In addition, the company has extremely strong capital, branch offices all over the country, and its own trucks and ships for transportation, so the company will inevitably monopolize China's import and export commerce. At the same time, the Chinese bureaucratic capital participating in the company can also obtain a large amount of foreign exchange at low prices, evade taxes, and use bank funds. The company can monopolize the Chinese market as it pleases. The newspaper said: The company is also further making industrial investments and is negotiating investments in Chengdu's hydropower and transportation industries. In the future, it will inevitably control the entire Chinese economy and become China's "East India Company." (Note: The East India Company was a British economic aggression agency in India, established in 1600. Britain used this agency to turn India into its colony.)

    上海文汇报发表社论
    剖析“中美实业公司”
    它是美国资本与中国官僚资本结合
    独占中国实业变中国为美殖民地的工具。
    【新华社延安廿五日电】据上海自由主义报纸文汇报本月十日社论称：美国陈纳德所主持的“中美实业公司”，将成为美国在华的“东印度公司”。该报首述最近该报记者走访该公司负责人，据谈：（一）中美实业公司除有“中央”大员参加外，还有四川、云南、广西、各省的显要参加。（二）陈纳德为该公司常务董事之一。（三）该公司已在长沙、衡阳、汉口、重庆、广州、天津等处设立分公司，以后视业务所需还要增设。（四）行政院已允许。该报继称：“这个公司无疑是以美国资本为主体，开创美国资本与中国官僚资本结合起来独占中国实业的端倪。”该报指出：据说中美公司目前主要业务为进出口贸易，举凡美国所需我国出口的物资，如茶业、猪鬃、毛骨、桐油等，以及我国所需美国进口物资如机械、药品及一切生活用品，统由该公司采办。加以该公司资本极其雄厚，分公司遍设各地，且自备卡车轮船等，往来运输，故该公司必将独占中国的进出口商业。同时，参与该公司的中国官僚资本，又可廉价取得大量外汇，逃避捐税，并可运用银行资金。该公司更可为所欲为地独占中国市场。该报称：该公司还在进一步作工业投资，正洽商投资于成都水电、交通事业等。演变到将来，必将控制整个中国经济命脉，成为中国的“东印度公司”。（按：东印度公司为英国在印度之经济侵略机关，成立于一六○○年，英国即经由该机关使印度变为其殖民地。）
