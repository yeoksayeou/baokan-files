　　The Battle of Annihilation at Qucun
　　At two o'clock on New Year's Day morning, three bright signals rose from the northwest corner of Qucun town, bringing good news to the people: the brave soldiers of the Tongpu Detachment had broken through the fortified forward positions of the Yan army and scaled the walls of Qucun town.
　　At midnight on New Year's Eve, when the enemy in the bunker on the northwest corner of the city wall discovered us, they began to curse arrogantly and shamelessly. The commanders and fighters simply set up heavy weapons fifty meters away from the enemy's "turtle shell," and the soldiers silently advanced to the city wall. Even the civilian laborers from Hongdong who participated in the battle nervously transported grenades to the outer moat. The artillery fire began by bombarding the bunker, driving the enemy out immediately, but they still lay on the city wall to resist. The grenade-throwing team threw more than a thousand grenades onto the city wall. Company Commander Yang Shengrong threw more than a hundred in one breath, instantly creating a wall of fire on the city wall with the sparks of the grenades. The soldiers quickly put the ladders up to the city wall, and the artillery fire exploded fiercely... Zhao Junyi, the resourceful and brave leader of the assault team, led five team members nimbly up the ladder. However, the ladder was nine feet shorter than the city wall. Zhao Junyi, in a moment of quick thinking, squatted down and told Li Guangdong to climb onto his back, sending him up to the city wall. Then he sent the remaining six people up. The panicked enemy began to flee, and Li Guangdong and others chased after them, capturing three.
　　The enemy on the west side of the city never expected that the forward positions they had built for four months would be breached so quickly. They attempted to retake the positions and began to charge. Li Guangdong and others, having run out of grenades, took up their bayonets and waited, capturing one enemy soldier after another. When the enemy under the city wall launched another counter-attack, Li Guangdong and his men already had more grenades. Dozens of grenades drove the enemy back. The follow-up troops had also crossed the city wall and occupied the positions.
　　At this time, the enemy's 7th and 8th companies were respectively holding onto two courtyards and a bunker, waiting for reinforcements from Quwo City. The artillerymen bombarded the courtyards. The fire from the shells ignited the Phoenix Tower in the northeast corner of the courtyard, and the fire gradually grew larger. The soldiers shouted to them, urging them to surrender. Soon, the small building collapsed, and several die-hard stubborn soldiers were burned to death. Frightening black smoke and ruthless flames fiercely pounced towards the large house to the south. The 7th Company Commander and a platoon leader opened a hole in the wall of the house and climbed out, still trying to break through, but were swept down by machine gun bullets as soon as they came out. The facts proved that holding out and breaking through were both futile. The remaining sixty or so enemies surrendered. A platoon leader said, "No wonder the people scold us for being stubborn. Our company commander is the most stubborn one. Otherwise, we would have surrendered long ago!"
　　The courtyard occupied by the 8th Company had a vast open space on the east, west, and north sides. Our machine gunners accurately sealed off the gun holes in the stronghold. Assault team leader Dong Tiande gave a powerful pep talk to the seven team members two minutes before crossing the open space. Long Wanyin, a soldier who had just been liberated in Shitou Yita, made a solemn vow: "No matter how fiercely the enemy fights, we will put the ladder up." Eight warriors carried the ladder like a whirlwind across the twenty-meter open space. The enemy threw grenades from the gun holes. Long Wanyin, with lightning speed, threw several smoking grenades to the side, ensuring everyone's safety. Six assault team members nimbly placed the ladder against the enemy's house roof, climbed onto the ladder, dug a hole in the roof, and threw grenades into the house, while shouting to urge the enemy to surrender. The enemy inside quickly threw their machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers out of the doors and windows. The 8th Company Commander ordered them to quickly line up and accounted for one hundred and ten people, and then shouted to a squad in the southeast of the village, who also surrendered.
　　In this way, the most elite 3rd Battalion of the Quwo Patriotic Corps was eliminated by us. (Taiyue Branch)

　　曲村歼灭战
    元旦早晨两点钟，从曲村镇西北的城角升起三束明亮亮的信号，它给人们带来了一个喜讯，同蒲支队英勇的健儿们已突破了阎军强固的前沿阵地，登上了曲村镇的城墙。
    除夕的午夜，当西北城角碉堡上的敌人发觉我们时，曾狂妄无耻的辱骂起来，指战员们索性把重武器架在离敌人乌龟谷五十公尺的地方，战士们一声不响的前进到城墙边，连洪洞参战的民夫们也紧张的把手榴弹运到外壕边，炮火一开始就向碉堡轰击，一下把敌人赶出来，但他们仍伏在城墙上抵抗。投弹组把一千余个手榴弹向城墙上摔去，连长杨生荣一口气摔了一百多个，顿时炸弹的火花在城墙上筑成了一堵火墙，战士们迅速的把梯子搭到城墙上去，炮火在激烈的爆裂着……。赵俊义这个机智勇敢的突击组长，带五个组员敏捷的爬上梯子去。可是梯子比城墙还低九尺，赵俊义急中生智，把身子一蹲，叫李光东上到自己的背上，把他送上城墙去，接着又把其余的六个人送上去，惊慌的敌人开始逃跑了，李光东等追上去捉住了三个。
    在西城的敌人万万没有想到，修了四个月的前沿阵地，会如此迅速的被突破，他们企图夺回阵地，开始进行冲锋。李光东等没有了手榴弹，就端起刺刀等着，过来一个俘虏一个，等城墙下的敌人再度反冲锋时，李光东他们已经又有了手榴弹，几十个手榴弹就把敌人打回去。后续部队也已越过城墙占领阵地。
    这时敌人第七连和第八连分别死守着两个院子和一个碉堡，等待曲沃城的援兵，炮兵们就对院房轰击起来，炮弹的火燃着了院东北角的凰楼，火势逐渐大起来，战士们对他们喊话，争取他们缴枪，一会儿小楼烧塌，几个死心塌地顽军被烧死了，吓人的黑烟和无情的烈火猛烈的向南边大房扑去，第七连连长和一个排长从房壁上打开了一个洞口爬出来，还想突围，刚出来就被机枪子弹扫倒了。事实证明死守和突围都是无济于事的，剩下的六十多个敌人投降了，一个排长说：“怪不得老百姓都骂我们顽固哩，我们的连长就是个最顽固的东西，要不，我们早就缴了枪！”
    第八连盘据的院子，东西北三面是片广阔地，我们的机枪手准确封锁住据点的枪眼，突击组长董天德在通过广阔地前两分钟，向七个组员作了有力的鼓动。刚在石头屹塔被解放的战士龙万银发出庄严的誓言：“不管敌人打的多凶，也要把梯子搭上去。”八个勇士抬起梯子如狂风一样的穿过二十米达的开阔地，敌人从枪眼里扔出手榴弹，龙万银以神速的动作，把几颗冒烟的手榴弹摔过一边去，保住了大家的安全，六个突击队员敏捷的将梯子架在敌人的房背上，登上梯子在房上挖洞向房内扔进手榴弹，一边喊话争取敌人投降，里面敌人很快就把机枪、步枪、掷旨筒一齐从门窗摔出来了，八连连长命令迅速排队，点交了一百一十个人，随即又向村东南的一个班喊叫，也缴了枪。
    就这样曲沃爱乡团最精锐的第三营被我们消灭了。（太岳分社）
