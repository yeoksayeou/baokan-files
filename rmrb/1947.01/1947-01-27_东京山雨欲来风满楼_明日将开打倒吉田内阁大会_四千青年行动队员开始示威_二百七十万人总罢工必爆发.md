    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: According to a United Press report from Tokyo, 500,000 members of Japanese national trade unions, agricultural associations, and other organizations will mobilize to participate in the "Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet Rally" on January 28th, as the first step in the 2.7 million-strong general strike of government agencies and public utilities to be launched on February 1st. The rally to overthrow the cabinet will be held in the square in front of the Imperial Palace, after which it will split into two groups to march through the streets of Tokyo, before proceeding to the Prime Minister's official residence to demonstrate. According to Tokyo newspapers, a prominent feature of this demonstration is the organization of a picket line to maintain order. Approximately 4,000 members of the Youth Action Squad organized by the General Strike Joint Struggle Committee conducted a demonstration march on the 24th. The procession stretched for a mile, passing through the main streets of Tokyo. Demonstrators held various slogans, the most prominent of which was "Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet." The demonstration was led by red flags and the singing of "The Internationale."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 25th: A summary of Tokyo news indicates that the 2.7 million-strong general strike of Japanese government agencies, civil servants, and public utility workers, scheduled to begin on February 1st, is poised to erupt. In recent days, the U.S. occupation authorities in Japan and Japanese reactionaries have been trying to sabotage this magnificent undertaking by Japanese workers. On the 22nd, officers of MacArthur's headquarters convened a meeting of representatives from three labor organizations and several Japanese government cabinet members, attempting to induce the unions to abandon their strike plans by offering slight wage increases. The right-wing of the Socialist Party issued a statement opposing the general strike, but this action only proved effective with the consistently conservative Foreign Ministry Civil Servants' Union, which has announced its non-participation in the strike. Other unions are maintaining their original demands. On the 20th, Japanese reactionaries dispatched two members of the Labor Masses Party (a small, far-right party) to assassinate Katsumi Kikunami, chairman of the Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, who is leading the general strike. Mr. Kikunami, who is also an editorial writer for the Asahi Shimbun, suffered injuries to his back and abdomen, but his life is not in danger. When receiving the press on the 21st, he vehemently denounced such fascist tactics. News of this incident has aroused extreme indignation in Japanese labor circles, and the general strike plan is now inevitable. The Treasury Ministry Workers' Union decided on the 24th that, starting from the 27th, all work exceeding working hours would cease entirely, as a preparatory step for the general strike on February 1st. The Tokyo Government Agencies Civil Servants' Union declared on the 24th that this strike will cause the complete cutoff of tap water to major factories and government facilities. However, the supply of tap water to ordinary households will be managed and supplied by the union.

    【新华社延安二十五日电】据合众社东京讯：日本全国工会农会及其他团体之会员五十万人，将动员起来参加一月二十八日的“打倒吉田内阁大会”，以作为将于二月一日发动的政府机关及公用企业二百七十万人总罢工的第一步骤。以倒阁大会将在皇宫门前广场举行，会后将分两批游行东京街市，再前往首相官邸示威。据东京报载，此次示威的突出特点为有纠察队组织以维持秩序。总罢工之联合斗争委员会所组织之青年行动队队员约四千人，于二十四日曾作示威游行。行列长达一英里，途经东京各主要街衢，示威者手持各种标语，其中最显著者为打倒吉田内阁。示威队伍前，高举红旗，高唱《红旗歌》。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】综合东京消息：定于二月一日开始的日本政府机关公务员及公用事业职工之二百七十万人大罢工，势将爆发。连日来，驻日美军当局及日本反动派力图破坏这次日本工人的壮举，麦克阿瑟总部官兵于二十二日召集三劳工组织代表及日政府阁员多人举行会议，图以增加些微工资而使工会放弃罢工计划。社会党右派声明反对总罢工，但此等行动仅对一贯保守之外务省公务员工会生效，该工会已宣布不参加罢工，而其他工会仍坚持原来要求。日本反动派又曾于二十日派遣两名劳工大众党（极右翼之小党）党徒二人行刺领导总罢工之日本产业工会联合会主席菊浪胜三，菊氏为朝日新闻社论主笔，背腹均受伤，惟尚无性命之虞。他在二十一日招待新闻界时，力斥此种法西斯手段。此一事件传出后，日劳工界愤激异常，总罢工计划势在必行。大藏省职工区四日决定，自二十七日起，一切超过工作时间之工作一概停止，作为二月一日总罢工之准备步骤。东京政府机关公务员工会二十四日宣称，此次罢工将使各大工厂及政府设备之自来水等将全部断绝。至于普通家庭使用之自来水，则由工会管理供应。
