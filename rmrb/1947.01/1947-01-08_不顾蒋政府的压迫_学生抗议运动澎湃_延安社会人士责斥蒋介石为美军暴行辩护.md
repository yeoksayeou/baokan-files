Xinhua News Agency Reports: Chiang Kai-shek's open order to suppress student protests across the country regarding the rape case committed by American soldiers in Beiping has further aroused the indignation of people nationwide. According to a United Press report: Students from all universities in Beiping, including Peking University, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, Chaoyang University, and others, have jointly formed an Action Committee to Protest American Troops' Atrocities, ensuring a reasonable resolution to the rape case. The committee passed the following resolutions: (1) A letter to Chiang Kai-shek, (2) A letter to Marshall, forwarded to Truman and Byrnes, (3) A letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, (4) A letter to the American People, (5) A letter to the Chinese People, (6) A letter to Chinese Students. The committee declared: The protest movement will continue until justice is served. Meanwhile, all students at Peking University protested against the atrocities of the American soldiers and held demonstrations. When students loudly recounted the bestial acts of the American soldiers to the audience, citizens could not help but shed tears. The student union of the university issued a letter to compatriots nationwide, calling on compatriots across the country to respond. Students in various regions are also responding one after another. According to Reuters and United Press Shanghai reports: Shanghai students from various schools, after four days of strikes and marches, have decided to temporarily resume classes under the leadership of the newly established "Committee to Protest American Troops' Atrocities," to wage a sustained struggle. The committee declared: They will continue this movement until all American troops withdraw from China. Reuters stated: The committee has decided to call for a general strike and appealed to public organizations in the city to sign in support. United Press stated: The National College of Law suggested boycotting American goods. It is reported that college students are considering this suggestion. Reuters also stated: Thirty Shanghai university professors have signed and issued a statement calling for support for the Nanjing students' demonstration and demands to the American ambassador. Furthermore, according to an Associated Press Nanjing dispatch: Nanjing students staged another demonstration on the 3rd. Before the Peking University students set out for the march, Professor Xiang Da of the History Department was verbally abused and beaten by special agent students for stopping them from causing trouble, and Xiang resigned from the university as a result. Social figures in Yan'an believe: Chiang Kai-shek's "instruction" to prohibit protests is the most disgraceful document, using "private behavior" to defend the atrocities of the American soldiers. This is a question of patriotism versus treason, not a question of "private behavior."

    不顾蒋政府的压迫
    学生抗议运动澎湃
    延安社会人士责斥蒋介石为美军暴行辩护
    【本报综合报导】据新华社报导：蒋介石公开命令压制各地学生对北平美军强奸事件的抗议运动，愈加引起全国人士的愤恨。据合众社讯：北平全市各大学，包括北大、燕京，清华、朝阳等校学生，联合组成抗议美军暴行的行动委员会，保证强奸案得到合理解决，该会通过：（一）致蒋介石书，（二）致马歇尔并转杜鲁门与贝纳斯书，（三）致联合国秘书处书，（四）致美国人民书，（五）致中国人民书，（六）致中国学生书。该委员会宣称：抗议运动直到正义得到伸张为止。同时北大全体学生抗议美军暴行，并举行游行示威，当学生向观众大声讲述美军兽行经过时，市民无不落泪。该校学生自治会发表告全国同胞书，呼吁全国同胞响应。现各地学生亦纷纷响应，据路透社、合众社上海消息：经过四天罢课游行之上海各校学生，已决定由新成立之“抗议美军暴行委员会”领导持久的斗争而暂行复课。该委员会宣称：他们将继续此一运动直到所有美军退出中国为止。路透社称：该委员会已决定号召总罢课，并吁请市内公共团体签名支持。合众社称：国立法学院建议应抵制美货。据悉：各大学生已考虑此一建议。路透社并称：三十个上海大学教授已签名发表声明，呼吁支持南京学生之示威及向美大使提出要求。又据美联社南京电：南京学生三日曾再度示威游行。在北大学生出发游行前，史学教授向达，因制止特务学生捣乱，竟遭后者辱骂欧打，向氏即向校方辞职。延安社会人士认为：蒋介石禁止抗议的“指示”，为最可耻的文件，拿“私人行为”来为美军暴行辩护。这是爱国与卖国的问题，不是什么“私人行为”问题。
