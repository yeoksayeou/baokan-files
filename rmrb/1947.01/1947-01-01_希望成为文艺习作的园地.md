　　Hoping to Become a Garden for Literary Works
    Kefeng
    (1) It is best for the supplement to become a regular publication, to determine a name, and to fix the masthead.
    (2) The supplement should have a clear direction. This direction is best to inspire and guide the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and literary youth among readers, to stir up enthusiasm, and to move forward in literary creation. There are not many purely literary publications in this area, and they are also monthly, absorbing too few external contributions. It is hoped that this supplement can become a garden for young comrades' literary works.
    (3) In the future, more purely literary works should be published, with short, concise, and meaningful pieces as the principle (features and long communications should be arranged on another page).
    (4) Strive for lively layout, for example, the December 10th issue is better than many past issues.

    （一）副刊应成为定期刊，确定名字，刊定报头为好。
    （二）副刊要有一定的明确方针，这方针最好是启发和指导读者中喜好革命的大众的工农兵的文艺青年，鼓起热忱，在文艺习作中向前迈进。本地区纯文艺性的刊物不多，且又是月刊，吸收外稿太少，希望这个副刊能成为青年同志文艺习作的园地。
    （三）今后应该多登载纯文艺性质的作品，以短小精悍、意味深长的为原则（特写和长篇通信应排在另版）。
    （四）排版力求活泼，例如最近的十二月十日这一期就比较过去许多期好。
