Comrade Commander Liu Bocheng's Enlightenment to Propaganda Workers
Liu Beigeng

On February 2nd last year, I consulted Comrade Commander Liu Bocheng on the editorial policy of the "People's Army" newspaper. In the end, he said: "I have no other opinions, only that I hope you will always remember: what to advocate and what to oppose. When people read the newspaper, they should clearly understand what needs to be advocated and what needs to be opposed at present. If you can do this, the newspaper's role will definitely be significant."

Positivity and accuracy are the two major principles that Commander Liu required propaganda workers to adhere to. He taught us: Simply exposing the enemy's crimes is not enough; it is more important to inspire people to further struggle against the enemy. Simply refuting the enemy's rumors is not enough; it is more important to proactively promote correct ideas. Sometimes, after reading the draft of a propaganda piece, Commander Liu would say, "The wording isn't positive enough. That's not good. You have to think of a way from a positive perspective." Regarding the facts, place names, people's names, and numerical figures reported, Commander Liu cautioned us: "They must be very accurate, very accurate. Only with accuracy is there strength."

Several times when we were producing propaganda materials, Commander Liu's opinion on the written expression was always: "It is very important to be concise and clear." Commander Liu's speeches and articles embody these two characteristics.

In July 1939, during the operation to smash the Japanese invaders' "mopping-up," Commander Liu personally wrote several leaflets, elaborating on the Party Central Committee's propositions of "persist in resistance, unity, and progress, and oppose surrender, division, and regression." Unfortunately, the original text cannot be found. According to my memory, those leaflets were only the size of "New Masses," were mimeographed, and contained no more than three hundred words at most. However, they sharply and clearly distinguished between the two completely different lines of the Chinese people, the Communist Party, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and told the people that only by following the first path could China obtain light. At the time, I read it several times and couldn't find a single empty word or unnecessary phrase. Every word had its purpose.

Commander Liu often paid attention to slogans on walls. In the early summer of 1939, the Propaganda Team of the 129th Division's Political Department painted many slogans in the wheat storage area of Licheng. Commander Liu walked from one wall to another, painstakingly looking at them, often frowning, because the characters were not written straight, and the thickness and length were not uniform, making it difficult for him to understand the meaning of the slogans at once. Later, Commander Liu mentioned this matter at a meeting, saying, "Artistic characters must first be understandable. Writing them like hanged ghosts, making people unable to figure them out, is not good."

Commander Liu regarded drama as an important weapon for educating the troops. On May 9th last year, in a letter to Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Jichun, Commander Liu wrote:

"...Recently, it is urgently necessary to do unity work for the military-political relationship, which is also one of the tasks instructed by the 'Seventh National Congress'. In Yan'an, I talked with Comrade Kang Sheng about adapting the story of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru's reconciliation into a play to educate everyone, especially soldiers who are self-satisfied because of their merits. If our troops stationed in Handan can produce and perform this play, it will be of particularly profound significance for unity education."

From these short hundred words, we not only see Commander Liu's emphasis on the educational power of drama, but also vividly point out that drama must have a central idea of what to advocate and what to oppose.

Songs are also a force that Commander Liu valued in educating the troops. He advocated that songs should be majestic and full of fighting spirit. In May 1939, the direct units of the division were popularizing the "Wangjiazhuang" tune. Commander Liu said, "The 'ya er yo, ya er yo' really makes people feel weak. The songs sung by soldiers must be very majestic. They shouldn't make people fall asleep after singing, but make people stand up and fight!"

In mid-December 1942, in a military report, when talking about the need to be prepared for sudden enemy attacks at all times, Commander Liu praised a Soviet song, "If Tomorrow There is War," because it rang an alarm for the Soviet people: be prepared to strike the invaders at any time. This means that only songs that are combined with the current struggle tasks can exert their power.

Improving the cultural level of the troops is a matter of concern to Commander Liu. He used this analogy: theory is like treasure locked in a safe, and culture is the key to open the safe. With improved cultural levels, learning military and politics will be much easier.

In 1941, Commander Liu read an article called "Terror Strategist" from "Ji Wen" (a mimeographed booklet compiled by the Youth Journalists Association Battlefield Service Team), which was translated from the American magazine New Republic. He immediately instructed the Propaganda Department to include it in the then army cadre publication, "Anti-Japanese Battlefield," meaning to make the cadres aware of the truth about fascist tactics.

"New Masses" is a mass publication in the region, and Commander Liu is its regular reader. In one issue, an article entitled "Radio Aircraft Detector - Radar" was published. After reading it, Commander Liu sent the original book to the Propaganda Department, explaining that it should be reprinted in the "People's Army" newspaper to increase the knowledge of commanders and fighters about new weapons.

During the Patriotic Self-Defense War, Commander Liu personally supplemented, translated, and proofread the second volume of "Combined Tactics" in his busy schedule, and sent a special person back to the rear to have it printed, so that the book could be published as soon as possible to help commanders learn tactics.

During the Anti-Japanese War period in the Taihang area, a magazine called "Youth and Children" was published, and our studious Commander Liu was also its reader. One issue published a statistic on students' career aspirations after graduation, and no one wanted to do military work. Commander Liu felt, "This is a big problem. The characteristic of the Chinese revolution is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. Without arms, the people can't even think of turning over. If everyone doesn't love to be a soldier, their children and grandchildren will have to be slaves and beasts of burden forever. This is a shortcoming in our education, and we must find a way to correct it."

    刘司令员伯承同志
    对宣传工作者的启示
    刘备耕
    去年二月二日，为了“人民的军队”报的编辑方针问题，向刘司令员伯承同志请示，最后他说：“我没有其他的意见，只希望你们时刻记着：提倡什么、反对什么。人家一看报纸，就清楚当前要提倡什么、反对什么，做到这样，报纸的作用一定是很大的。”
    积极和准确，是刘司令员要求宣传工作者必须遵守的两大原则。他教导我们：单纯暴露敌人的罪行是不够的，更重要的是鼓舞人们进一步向敌人斗争；单纯批驳敌人的谣言是不够的，更重要的是主动地宣传正确的主张。有时，刘司令员看过宣传品原稿后，说：“提法不积极，这不好，你要从积极方面想出办法来。”对报导的事实、地名、人名及数目字，刘司令员告诫我们：“要弄得十分准确，十分准确，只有准确，才有力量。”
    我们几次制作宣传品的时候，刘司令员对文字表现的意见总是：“做到简要、明确，是十分要紧的。”刘司令员的讲话和文章，即是这两个特点的具体化。
    一九三九年七月，在粉碎日寇“扫荡”作战中，刘司令员亲自写了几张传单，阐扬党中央“坚持抗战、团结、进步，反对投降、分裂、倒退”的主张，可惜原文无法寻找，根据我的记忆：那些传单纸张只有“新大众”那么大小，是油印的，字数最多不超过三百字，可是却尖锐地明确地划清了中国人民、共产党同国民党反动派之间的两条截然不同的路线，并告诉人民只有走头一条路，中国才能得到光明。当时我读了好几遍，找不到一句空话、或不必要的字句，每一个字都有每一个字的作用。
    刘司令员时常注意墙头标语。一九三九年初夏，一二九师政治部宣传队在黎城麦仓刷写了不少的标语，刘司令员从这个墙头走到那个墙头，费劲地看着，不时皱着眉头，因为字儿写不端正，粗细长短不整齐，使他不能一下子看懂标语的意思，后来刘司令员在一次会上提到这个事情，他说：“艺术字首先要叫人看得懂，写得像吊死鬼一样，叫人摸不到头脑，那就不好罗。”
    戏剧，刘司令员把它看成教育部队的重要武器。去年五月九日，刘司令员给张副政委际春同志的信中，他这样写道：
    “……近来军政关系亟需做团结工作，这也是“七大”所指示的工作之一。在延安曾与康生同志谈：将廉颇与蔺相如交欢故事编一曲戏来教育大家，特别是军人以功高自居者。我们驻在邯郸，如有军中编出此剧来演，于团结教育意义尤深。”
    从短短的一百字里，不但看到了刘司令员重视戏剧的教育力量，而且也生动地指出了戏剧须要有提倡什么、反对什么的中心思想。
    歌曲，也是刘司令员所重视的教育部队的一个力量，他主张歌曲要雄壮，并充满战斗气概。一九三九年的五月，师直属队曾流行“王家庄”小调。刘司令员说：“呀儿哟、呀儿哟的，真使人伤筋动骨，军人唱的歌子，一定要十分雄壮的，不是唱了它叫人倒下来睡觉，而是唱了它叫人站起来斗争！”
    一九四二年十二月中旬，刘司令员在军事报告中，讲到要时刻防备敌人突然袭击的时候，他推崇苏联的一支歌曲——“假若明天战争”，因为它向苏联人民敲着警钟：准备随时打击侵略者。这就是说，只有与当前斗争任务相结合的歌曲，才能发挥它的力量。
    部队文化水准的提高，是刘司令员所关心的问题。他是这样打譬喻的：理论好比锁在保险箱的财宝，而文化呢，却是打开箱子的钥匙；文化程度提高了，学习军事政治也要容易得多。
    一九四一年，刘司令员从“辑文”（青年记者学会战地服务队编的油印册子）中读到由美国新共和杂志选译过来的，叫做“恐怖的战略家”的一篇文章，他立即责成宣传部编入当时军队干部刊物——“抗日战场”中去，意思是要使干部认识法西斯主义战术的真相。
    “新大众”是本区群众性的刊物，而刘司令员是它的经常读者。有一期，刊载了一篇《无线电飞机探测器——雷达》，刘司令员看了过后，把原书寄给宣传部，说明要在“人民的军队”报上转载，以增进指战员对新兵器的知识。
    在爱国自卫战争中，刘司令员在百忙中，亲自补译和校正“合同战术”的下册，并派专人送回后方付印，使该书早日出版，以帮助指挥员的战术学习。
    太行区在抗日战争时期，出版有“青年与儿童”杂志，我们好学的刘司令员也是它的读者。有一期登了一个学生毕业后工作志向的统计，内中没有人爱做军事工作的，刘司令员觉得：“这是个大问题。中国革命的特点，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命，没有武装，人民就休想翻身，假若人人不爱当兵，子子孙孙就得永远当奴隶做牛马。这是我们教育上的缺点，要想法子改正才好。”
