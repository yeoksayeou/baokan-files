Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao published an editorial the day after the "National Assembly" closed, pointing out: "The biggest shortcoming of this constitution is that this constitutional National Assembly lacked a scale of peace and unity." That is, the constitution itself, "because it was formulated under the Kuomintang's dictatorship, the Kuomintang's doctrines and theories still dominate the content of the constitution," and pointed out: the possible danger of "the government wielding this constitution to eliminate dissidents," regarding Article 8 of the "National Assembly's" adoption of constitutional implementation measures, "When two-thirds of the National Assembly representatives and Legislative and Supervisory Committee members produced in accordance with the constitution are newly elected, they may hold legal gatherings and convocations," considering that this would make "the country even more likely to become a long-term fractured situation."

The newspaper also published editorials and special articles on the 27th of last month and the 5th of this month, refuting the "stubborn" combination of China and the United States, refusing to implement a responsible cabinet system, a parliamentary system, and democratic local autonomy under the pretext of "not conforming to national conditions," and maintaining a one-party dictatorship. The editorial on the 27th said: Some Chinese "stubborn" people even used the words of American Professor Pound as a basis, because Pound said that the presidential centralized five-power system conforms to China's national conditions, the cabinet system does not conform to China's national conditions, saying that China should adopt a unitary system, and that the separation of powers between the central and local governments does not conform to China's national conditions. The editorial stated: This is the same as what Yuan Shikai's American advisor Goodnow and Japanese advisor He Changxiong said in the early years of the Republic of China when Yuan Shikai wanted to become emperor, that the presidential system does not conform to China's national conditions and China should implement a constitutional monarchy, the purpose of which is to "support our stubborn people." On the 5th, the newspaper published Cai Shangsi's weekly essay, more sharply pointing out: "'National conditions theory' is the most proud and powerful excuse for a few powerful people, ambitious people, backward people, and corrupt people, and its intention and purpose lie entirely in being able to be permanently monopolized and occupied by one person, one faction, one surname, and one class." "And foreigners promote the theory of national conditions for us, and their intentions are also out of selfishness and self-interest. They are ostensibly 'helping' our government, but in fact, they are ruining our country's life," "their purpose is to make us all backward, permanently agricultural countries and feudal societies, so as to be their markets and raw material suppliers, and even become their colonies." "The Japanese are thinking this way." The author said indignantly: "In addition to infringing upon China's sovereignty, foreigners also use various methods to make the Chinese kill each other. This is really not in line with our national conditions!"

　　天津大公报抨击伪宪
    蒋介石妄图维护独裁造成中国的长期分裂
    【新华社延安十六日电】天津大公报于“国大”闭幕之次日发表社评，指出：“这部宪法最大的缺点是这次的制宪国大缺少了一个和平团结的规模”。即宪法本身，“因为是在国民党专政下制定的，国民党的主义和理论还支配着宪法的内容”，并指出：“政府手执着这部宪法，诛除异己”的可能危险，对“国大”通过之行宪办法第八条“依宪法产生之国大代表及立法监察委员新选达三分之二时，得为合法之集会及召集”一项规定，认为使“国家益可能成为长期破裂局面”。
    该报又于二十七日及本月五日发表社评及专论，辟驳中美“顽固”结合一起，以“不合国情”为借口拒绝实行责任内阁制、国会制、地方自治的民主制度，维护一党专制的作法。二十七日社评说：若干中国“顽固”且以美人庞德教授的话为依据，因庞德说过总统集权的五院制合于中国国情，内阁制不合中国国情，说中国宜采单一政体，中央与地方分权不合中国国情。该社论称：这和民国初年袁世凯要做皇帝时美国顾问古德诺、日本顾问贺长雄说总统制不合中国国情、中国应行君主立宪制的话一样，其目的在“给我们的顽固张目”。五日该报发表蔡尚思的星期论文，更尖锐指出：“‘国情说’是少数实力者、野心者、落伍者、腐败者最得意最有力的一种借口，其用意与目的全在乎可以由自己一人、一派、一个姓、一个阶层永久包办独占下去。”“而外国人为我们提倡国情论，用意实也出于自私自利。他们名为大帮我们政府的‘忙’，实则断送我们国家的生命”，“其目的在要我们一切落后，永久是农业国家、封建社会，以便作他们的市场与原料供给者，甚至作了他们的殖民地。”“如日本人便是这样想的。”作者愤慨的说：“外国人除了侵犯中国主权以外，还用种种方式来使中国人互相残杀。这才真是不合我们的国情”！
