[Reported from Jixian by our newspaper] The Kuomintang Government in Northern Henan Frantically Conscripts Soldiers
Popular Resistance Grows Daily
The Kuomintang Army Devises Strict Measures to Monitor New Recruits, but Still Cannot Prevent Desertion by Lower-Ranking Officers and Soldiers

[This newspaper's dispatch from Jixian] In order to replenish its troop losses, Chiang Kai-shek is frantically conscripting soldiers in various parts of Northern Henan. The Kuomintang county government in Jixian initially requested 940 conscripts, but the number doubled at the bao level, and doubled again at the jia level. Before the conscription, the bao and jia chiefs compiled registers of men aged 18 to 30, with corresponding numbers. On the appointed day, the bao chief led a team to surround the village and capture people door to door. The conscription was originally scheduled for October 6th, but the plan was leaked, and all the young men in the city and countryside fled. All the large and small businesses were forced to close. The largest grain store, Wan Yiheng, still dares not open its doors. On November 16th, Du Xiyao, the Kuomintang county magistrate, shamelessly declared at a meeting of merchants and residents in the town: "Now the order has come down, we don't need conscripts anymore. I will swear to you!" As soon as the meeting was dismissed, martial law was declared. The county magistrate then directed the troops to arrest most of the people who had attended the meeting. At the same time on the same day, many conscripts were seized by similar means in villages throughout the county. Conscripting soldiers is also a good way for Chiang's dog officials to make money. Conscripts who "fail the examination" must secretly bribe them with ten shi of wheat or 1.2 million yuan in legal tender to be released. Poor people are left with only death in the face of such things. Du Xiyao has now become a very wealthy man. The tragedies and resistance caused by conscription are endless. Bai Guangliang, a resident of Nanma City Street in the town of the county, had two older brothers conscripted, and this time he was also conscripted. Another resident of the same street was also seized, forcing his white-haired mother and wife and children to commit suicide by jumping into the river. When he heard the news in the detention center, he also hanged himself with his belt. To escape the Kuomintang government's conscription, people even go so far as to cripple themselves. Wang, a resident of Gutuo Village in the northwestern countryside of the city, feared conscription and used a guillotine to chop off half of his foot! After a conscript from a certain village was captured, his wife ran to the detention center and repeatedly asked to see her husband to explain family affairs. After meeting, she cruelly gouged out one of her husband's eyeballs with an awl! The people's hatred for Chiang's bandits is growing deeper and deeper, and their resistance is becoming increasingly active. The Jixian prison is full of women and old men, all of whom are innocent family members of conscripts. The people delivering food every day are as crowded as if they were at a fair. The prison is filled with heart-wrenching cries and shouts. These debts of blood must be settled. This volcano of hatred will surely erupt in the near future, burning Chiang's bandits and their dog officials to death! (Yang Zhen)

[This newspaper's dispatch from Jixian] The phenomenon of war-weariness and desertion among Kuomintang soldiers is increasing daily. The Kuomintang Third Reorganized Division, which was annihilated by our General Liu Bocheng's troops last autumn, recently frantically conscripted soldiers in Henan, piecing them together. They were transported from the south bank of the Yellow River to Xinxiang, but they did not dare to issue guns to the new recruits. Even after arriving in Huixian, they only issued guns during the day and collected them at night. The surveillance is extremely strict, but they still cannot prevent desertion by lower-ranking officers and soldiers. The following is a document seized by our army during the recent annihilation of a part of the transportation company of the 59th Regiment of the 20th Brigade of that division: "Precautions for getting on and off the train and during travel," totaling six items: 1. Each unit must first guard the assigned vehicles and then board the train in order of platoon or two squads. When a platoon must be divided, the platoon leader must be in the same car as the new recruits. 2. If a new recruit is found jumping off the train, he can be tracked down and arrested when the train stops. During travel, he should be shot to death. 3. During travel, day or night, each car must have two guards and one officer. When the train stops, two guards must be stationed on each side of each car, holding guns in both hands, and monitor closely. 4. When new recruits need to relieve themselves, the squad leader must gather them together, count them, and take them to the toilet area. 5. If new recruits want to buy something, they must be gathered together and not allowed to get off the train at will. 6. The locomotive and the guard car are equipped with telephones. If new recruits escape during travel, each unit can blow the whistle to stop the train for pursuit and killing. (Yang Zhen)

　　豫北蒋政府疯狂抓丁
    人民反抗日烈
    蒋军订出严密监视新兵办法仍防止不了下级官兵开小差
    【本报汲县讯】蒋介石为了补充兵员损失，在豫北各地疯狂抓叮汲县蒋记县政府第一次公开要九百四十名壮丁，到保里数目却增加一倍，到甲又增加一倍。抓丁前由保甲长将十八岁至三十岁的壮丁编制名册和号码。一到日子，保长就带领队伍，将村包围，挨门捕捉。本来决定十月六日抓，但事机不密，城里和乡下的壮丁都逃跑一空。大小商号都因此停了业。最大的粮店万镒恒至今不敢开门。十一月十六日，蒋记县长杜希尧在城关商民大会上无耻地宣称：“现在命令下来，不要壮丁了。我要哄你们管赌个咒！”谁知一散会，就戒严起来。县长就指挥着队伍将开会的人大部抓了去。当天同一时间，全县各村都用同样手段抓去了许多壮丁。抓丁也是蒋家狗官发财的好门路。“验不上”的壮丁要暗中塞一十石麦子或一百二十万元法币给他们才能放出。穷人们遇着这等事，只有死路一条。杜希尧现已变为大富翁了。因抓丁而引起的悲剧和反抗是说不完的。该县城关南马市街居民白光亮两个哥哥被抓去，这次又把他抓去，同街另一居民被抓去，逼得他白发苍苍的母亲和妻儿都跳河自尽了，他在看守所听见这消息，也用裤带上吊死了。为逃避蒋政府的抓丁，人民甚至不惜把自己的身体弄残废。城西北乡谷坨村王某怕抓丁，用铡刀将脚铡掉半节！某村一壮丁被抓后，他老婆跑到看守所，再三要求见丈夫交代家务。见面后，狠心地用锥子将她丈夫的眼珠挖去一只！人民对蒋贼的仇恨愈来愈深，反抗也日趋积极。汲县监狱里住满了娘儿们和老头，他们都是无辜的壮丁家属，每天送饭的人像赶集般拥挤。监里到处是令人酸鼻的哭声喊声。这群血账是要清算的，这座仇恨的火山在不久的将来一定会爆发，烧死蒋贼及其狗官们！（杨真）
    【本报汲县讯】蒋军士兵厌战及逃亡现象与日俱增。去秋为我刘伯承将军所部歼灭的蒋军整三师，近在河南大抓壮丁，拚凑起来，由黄河南岸开到新乡，还不敢发枪给新兵，到辉县后，也只白天发枪，晚上收回。监视极严，但也防止不了其下级官兵开小差。下面是我军最近歼灭该师二十旅五十九团输送连一部时所缴获之文件：“上下火车及行车间应注意事项”，计六条：一、各单位须按分配车辆，先行守卫，然后依次以排或两班上车。排必须分割时，排长须与新兵同车。二、发现跳车新兵，在停车时可跟踪追捕，行车时，即开枪射杀之。三、行车时，无论昼夜，每车须设卫兵二名，官长一员。停车时每车箱之两边，各设卫兵两名，两手端枪，严密监视之。四、停车新兵大小便时，班长须集合一起点数，带至大小便地点。五、新兵若欲购物，须将其集合一起，不得任意下车。六、机车与卫兵车均设有电话。各单位行车间，设有新兵逃跑，即可吹号，以便令车停止追杀之。（杨真）
