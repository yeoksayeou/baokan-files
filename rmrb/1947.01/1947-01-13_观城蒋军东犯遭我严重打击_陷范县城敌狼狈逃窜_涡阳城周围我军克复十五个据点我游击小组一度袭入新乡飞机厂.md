[Urgent Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Frontline of Our Newspaper, 8 PM on the 11th] A portion of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army invaded Fancheng County yesterday (the 10th) afternoon. Before they could establish a firm foothold, they were severely struck by our forces and abandoned the city this morning, fleeing westward. After our forces recovered Fancheng County, they are pursuing the enemy in the flush of victory.

[Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Frontline of Our Newspaper, 11th] Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army and 75th Division, after suffering a thousand casualties, exchanged them for the two empty cities of Guancheng and Puyang. Now they continue to advance eastward, attempting to occupy Fancheng County. Along the way, they have been severely intercepted by our forces, and Chiang Kai-shek's troops have suffered heavy casualties. Due to fear of our army, Chiang Kai-shek's troops do not dare to advance in large strides, and can only advance four or five *li* a day. Fancheng is only forty-five *hua li* from Guancheng, but Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army began its eastward advance after occupying Guancheng on the 2nd, and only occupied Fancheng County on the afternoon of the 10th. The Fifth Army attacks us every day before noon, and flees in panic after noon. After the enemy flees, our army once again recovers the villages that the enemy exchanged for with blood and flesh before noon.

[Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Frontline of Our Newspaper, 11th] After our army in the Yu皖Su liberated Woyang County in Anhui, they took advantage of the victory to expand their achievements. Fifteen strongholds of Chiang Kai-shek's troops around the city were successively restored by us, covering approximately six hundred square kilometers of territory. Tens of thousands of people have been liberated and, under the leadership of our democratic government, have begun to live a democratic and free life.

[Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Frontline of Our Newspaper, 11th] (Delayed) Our local corps, active on both sides of the Longhai Railway, actively cooperated with the Jinxiang periphery annihilation operation. On New Year's Eve last year, they destroyed nine *hua li* of railway between Luowang Station and Lanfeng (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly said Kaifeng) on the Longhai Railway, and harvested more than one hundred *li* of electric wires. A guerrilla group active near Xinxiang also raided the Xinxiang Aircraft Factory one night in January. Chiang Kai-shek's troops were terrified and fired guns all night.
