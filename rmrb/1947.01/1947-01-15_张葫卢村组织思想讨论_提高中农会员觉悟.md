(From our newspaper in Weixian, 13th) During the rent reduction movement, Guangzong paid attention to ideological mobilization. Zhang Hulucun has a total of eighty-two households, with sixty-four peasant members, more than half of whom are middle peasants, and four middle peasants among the seven cadres. After in-depth investigation, it was found that the middle peasant members were not ideologically consolidated enough. The leadership then mobilized activists and members to conduct ideological reviews and discussions, raising questions such as: which era was better in the past and present? Should illegal landlords be completely overthrown? What should we do if Chiang Kai-shek attacks? Middle peasant Zhang Doufu said: "I used to think that the struggle was only for the poor peasants, but now I realize it is for all peasants. I used to suffer a lot, even eating two ounces of salt was illegal. That year, the salt police arrested those who were secretly selling salt, tied me up with a rope, and fined me ten yuan. Landlords rely on exploitation to eat and drink well, they don't eat salt secretly, and they can't be tied up. It is always the poor who suffer. It is really heartbreaking to think about it. Now it is really enjoyable. If we don't unite to overthrow the landlord Chiang Kai-shek, we will not be able to live." The speeches of other groups were also very enthusiastic. Recalling the suffering in the past, everyone vowed to unite to the end and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and the illegal landlords. The fourteen middle peasant members who had previously "followed the crowd" and the two who were afraid of struggle greatly improved their consciousness. After the "What do landlords have more of? What do poor people have more of?" discussion among the members of the Farmers' Association in the South Street of the city, it was pointed out that in the past, landlords had more things from exploitation, more money, more grain, more prestige, and more wives; poor people had more exploitation, oppression, beatings, and abuse, more hard work, more blood and sweat, and more bachelors. From the comparison of the lives of landlords and peasants, the masses were encouraged to thoroughly eliminate feudal exploitation and unite to defend their liberation. After ideological education, the consciousness of the members of the Farmers' Association in Donghuocheng Village was greatly improved. Lü Zhangshi said: "If we hadn't redeemed the house and land we sold in the famine year, we would have starved to death long ago. I will never forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for the rest of my life." Zhang Guizhi said: "Before, my grandfather worked hard all his life, and his family starved all his life; the happiness the Communist Party gave our family is stronger than my grandfather working hard all his life." The chairman of the trade union said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the hired laborers have increased their wages and shared the fruits of the struggle. We have land to cultivate and food to eat at home. This year when I go home, I will no longer work as a hired laborer. I plan to go home and marry a wife."

　　张葫卢村组织思想讨论
    提高中农会员觉悟
    【本报威县十三日电】查减运动中，广宗注意进行思想发动。张葫卢村，共八十二户，农会员六十四人，中农会员占一半以上，七个干部中也有四个中农。经过深入调查，发现中农会员思想上不够巩固。领导上便动员积极分子、会员，进行思想检查和讨论，提出过去、现在那个世道好？彻底打垮非法地主该不该？蒋介石要进攻怎么办？中农张斗福说：“我早先认为斗争光为的贫农，现在我认识是为了全体农民。从前我受气的地方很多，连吃二斤小盐都犯法。那年盐警东抓淋小盐的，把我拴了一绳，还罚了十块钱。地主靠着剥削吃好的喝好的，吃不着小盐，拴也拴不着他，受罪都是穷人，想起来真痛心。现在可痛快了，真是大家不团结起来打垮地主老蒋，就不能过。”其他各组发言也很热烈，想起从前受的气，大家发誓一定要团结到底，打垮老蒋和非法地主。过去“随大流”走的十四户与怕斗的两户中农会员觉悟大大提高。城内南街农会会员经过“地主什么多？穷人什么多？”的讨论，提出以前地主剥削来的东西多、钱多、粮多、威风多、老婆多；穷人被剥削压迫挨打受气多、五更多、流的血汗多、光棍汉多。从地主与农民的生活对照中，鼓舞了群众彻底消灭封建剥削，团结保卫翻身的决心。东霍城寨农会员经过思想教育，觉悟大为提高，吕张氏说：“灾荒年卖的宅子地，要不赎回来，咱们早就饿死了。我一辈子忘不了共产党毛主席。”张贵芝说：“先前我爷扛了一辈子活，一家子挨了一辈饿；共产党给俺家的福强似爷爷扛一辈子活。”工会主任说：“在共产党毛主席领导下，雇工增了资，分了斗争果实，家中有了地种，有了饭吃，今年回家，再也不扛活了，我打算着回家娶个媳妇哩。”
