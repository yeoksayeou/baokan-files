　　Ping Shun Distributes Fruits of Victory, Caring for Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel
　　[Report from this newspaper] In the land leveling movement in Ping Shun villages, the fruits of victory were universally distributed with consideration for the families of military personnel and martyrs. Chongyan Village has eleven households of military families and martyrs, totaling thirty-seven people. Before the investigation and reduction, they collectively owned 56 mu of land, averaging 1.7 mu per person. After the investigation and reduction, with the exception of two military families whose landlord land remained unchanged, a total of 26 mu of land was added, averaging more than 2 mu of land per person. Landlord Wang Doushun is a wounded soldier who returned from the front lines. During this tail-cutting and hole-patching movement, the masses did not struggle against him, and he voluntarily offered three buildings. Chuanbo Village has nine military families; in the movement, they were given 14 mu of good land. The village struggled out a total of fifteen large and small cattle, and they were given priority in the distribution. Guo Kaojin is a soldier of the 49th Regiment; the masses exchanged his two mu of bad land for six mu of good land and used lumber from the village office to build him two new houses. In the distribution of fruits of victory in Baima Daqu and other villages, military families were given priority. Before the investigation and reduction, each person owned an average of two mu of land; after the investigation and reduction, this increased to three mu. The military families' bad houses were also exchanged for good buildings and kilns.
