Taixing's Experience in Overturning, Fighting, and Production in the Past Two Years (Continued)
　　Lai Ruoyu

　　Third, regardless of large or small cooperatives, they have established a democratic and sound leadership system and economic system in the past two years. Just as agricultural mutual aid solved the problem of calculating work points, this is the only way to consolidate and develop organizations. According to the experience of twenty-seven cooperatives, there are methods for investing, settling accounts, and distributing dividends. Investment is not restricted, and it can be offset with physical objects, and shares can be withdrawn in small amounts at any time. Shares withdrawn temporarily do not receive dividends but are treated as deposits and given a certain amount of interest. Accounting and dividend distribution are done on a regular basis, some every half year or year, three months, or four months. The length of the term is related to the business. For example, the Dongfengren Cooperative in Xiyang is once a year because it mainly engages in agriculture. The Baichi Cooperative in Huguan is in the iron industry, with capital and labor shares of workers, and dividends are distributed every three months. The Chaihu Cooperative in Xingtai mainly focuses on textiles and distributes every four months. The treatment of cooperative cadres is also fixed. Some cooperatives only provide food, and the village cultivates their fields on their behalf. When dividends are distributed, 5% or 10% of the dividends are drawn as remuneration. Some have the same treatment as workers, some adopt the supply system, and then draw a certain percentage from the dividends as remuneration, and some are also converted into labor shares for dividend distribution. In short, there must be a certain economic system with accounts to be calculated. At the same time, each cooperative elects a board of directors or a supervisory board, etc., to hold regular meetings for collective leadership.

　　Serving the masses and organizing the production and life of the masses, large and small cooperatives must help each other and develop together. The establishment of a complete set of democratic and sound systems is the main experience in developing cooperatives and a good direction for future development.

　　Three, Textile Industry:

　　Before the war, there was very little textile industry in this area. It was developed during the production and famine relief. At that time, the cooperatives provided loans for cotton, and the public subsidized it at the cost of losses. In the past few years, a large number of women spinners have been organized for production, and many heroes and experts have emerged. The scale of organization and achievements are very large. For example, seventeen counties now have more than 284,000 women spinners, which is six times larger than in 1943 and three times larger than in 1944. According to statistics from eight counties such as Pingshun, there are more than 125,000 women engaged in spinning and weaving (some of whom can only spin). More than 89,000 people have been organized, accounting for 71% to 72%. Due to the organization, not only has the output increased, but the technology has also improved. There are three forms of organization. One is the oil lamp mutual aid group, which is organized to save oil for collective spinning. This was the most common in the initial stage of development. One is textile mutual aid, that is, the exchange of labor between women spinners and women weavers, stipulating methods for recording work points. This form is now the most common. The third type is small factories. For example, this year, the women of Berlin, Wu'an, each contributed the same amount of cotton and funds to participate, and work points are also recorded for dividend distribution. Another type of factory is a small cooperative form, where labor and funds can be used as shares, and work points are also recorded. There is a set of leadership methods, production is high, and technology is easily improved. Based on such organization, from this spring to now, statistics from ten counties show that more than 3.08 million catties of cloth have been woven, earning more than 258 million yuan, which is an important item of sideline income.

　　Secondly, improve technology and quality. The quality of various printed cloths and quilt covers exhibited in this production exhibition hall is very good. Wu'an and Shahe used to have good textile technology, but now, after being organized for mutual assistance and competition, they have improved a step further. Before being organized, it took three and a half to four workdays to weave one catty of cotton into cloth. Now it only takes two and a half to three workdays. In addition, the improvement of tools is also very rapid. The number of indigenous looms in rural areas is decreasing, and the number of hand-pulled shuttle looms is increasing day by day (of course, the total number of textile tools, whether looms or spinning wheels, has also greatly increased compared to the past). Better tools such as foot-operated textile machines and iron machines have also increased. According to statistics from eight counties last year, an average of three looms were available for every seven weavers, of which 14% were hand-pulled shuttle looms. According to statistics from nine counties this year, an average of five looms were available for every eleven weavers, and hand-pulled shuttle looms accounted for 27%. At the same time, the improvement of technology is also related to the improvement of teacher-student relations. Various places invited teachers and encouraged teachers to bring apprentices, which motivated them. Almost all the heroes who attended this meeting have been teachers and brought apprentices, and also went to other villages to teach, which is very good. The above is about improving technology and quality, which is very important in the current textile movement.

　　Finally, there is the issue of raw materials and markets for developing the textile industry. Due to the promotion of cotton planting, the raw material problem has been largely solved in various places. However, the market problem needs to be solved, which must be well integrated with cooperation and marketing. This is the main thing. In addition, if the overall production is improved and the people's lives are improved, the market will also expand. For example, when Li Shunda made a plan, he felt that to make the time better, he would need to add quilts and clothes. In this way, as the people's living requirements increase, the cloth market will also expand. The expansion of the market will also further stimulate production to move forward. The market problem of textiles now should be helped well by the cooperative heroes, because textiles are a very important part of sideline occupations. According to the statistics of the ten textile heroes who attended the meeting, their income is equivalent to 76% of their agricultural income. Due to the development of textiles, women's status in society and in the family has been improved, and families that were not harmonious in the past have also become harmonious. The family relationships of the textile heroes who attended this meeting are very good.

　　The textile movement should be further developed in the future. It should be organized more widely, improve family relations, continue to improve technology and tools, and be closely combined with cooperative movements and family sideline occupations such as raising chickens, silkworms, and pigs. Zhao Chunhua's combination of textiles and family sideline occupations to organize women in the whole village to produce is a very good example.

　　Four, Industry and Commerce:

　　In the past two years, industry and commerce in this region have developed greatly, especially after the counter-offensive, we have had industrial and mining areas and cities. This is also an aspect of the production movement and an indispensable aspect of the entire liberated area economy. This is mainly the issue of urban construction in the liberated areas. Although we do not have many and large cities, we attach great importance to them because their role is great. Of course, today, urban industry and commerce serve the entire liberated area economy and serve the countryside. The model managers and merchant representatives who attended this meeting are also doing this, which is correct. So, what are our main experiences?

　　First, the development of industrial and commercial production must be combined with the workers' movement. After the counter-offensive, we recovered some industrial and mining areas from the enemy and puppets. First, we mobilized the workers, eliminated the oppression of the workers, raised the workers' awareness, united the capitalists, and respected the factories. Workers in many factories in the national economy sector (military industrial departments should be treated separately), such as coal mines, iron factories, and paper mills, participated in factory management in cooperation with the factories. This made the factory management more rational and better, and the workers' enthusiasm for production was also improved. For example, after the workers of the Xinhua Paper Mill participated in management, they proposed streamlining, reducing some cadres who were divorced from production. Workers competed with each other, and daily paper output and sun-drying were recorded, which was also a supervision of the cadres. After the workers were mobilized, the capitalists generally respected the workers' opinions, united with each other, and increased output. For example, the production of the Huafeng Iron Factory and the Xinhua Paper Mill has doubled. In particular, our military industry departments, such as the Changzhi Bomb Institute, completed five months of tasks in three months. Zhen Rongdian made even more artillery shells. He united the workers and actively increased production to support the front line. The efforts of the military industry workers directly guaranteed the supply of ammunition for the self-defense front line. Many stores also made better business by mobilizing the employees and uniting the east and west partners. This is labor-capital cooperation, where workers and factories unite to jointly develop industry and commerce in the liberated areas.

　　Second, the industrial and commercial production movement must be combined with improving the workers' lives. Some factories adopted a dividend system for workers, and some provided rewards. All those who did this consolidated their enthusiasm for production, production improved step by step, quality was good, costs were reduced, and the production level could be maintained. The same is true for stores. This is labor-capital benefit. In addition to solving wage dividend and other issues, we should also organize the production of workers' families and organize workers' consumption. For example, before the Jiaozuo Xinhua Company organized workers' consumption, the market price of grain would rise sharply every time wages were paid, and although wages were high, workers' lives could not be improved. Later, the problem was solved by organizing a workers' consumer cooperative.

　　Third, organize workers' study and cultural entertainment life, improve their awareness, and establish a new labor attitude. This can maintain the achievements and improve labor intensity. For example, the workers of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine have two hours of study every day, and the shop assistants in Xingtai also do the same.

　　Now that we have cities, the relationship between urban and rural workers and peasants is basically united. However, the rulers of the past created contradictions between urban and rural areas, and there are still remnants to this day, which should arouse our attention. Workers and peasants were both ruled and oppressed in the past, and now they are the masters of the liberated areas. We should universally establish the concept that workers and peasants are one family.

　　What I have talked about above is the production in the Taixing area in the past two years, most of which is in the old areas. Some new areas have also carried out production movements this year. After the new areas have thoroughly completed the "tillers have their land" and turned themselves over this winter, they will also organize and carry out production movements next year, striving to catch up with the old areas, forming a large production movement as a whole in the new and old areas, and making production achievements that exceed any previous year.

　　Fourth Issue: Heroes, Cadres, and the Masses

　　There are more heroes and models attending this conference than the previous one. There are twenty-one model workers attending the meeting, which is much more than the previous one. Without exception, these model workers have become models through certain undertakings and have their own expertise. They help heroes and lead the masses to do their work well. They themselves are also heroes. And most of the heroes who attended the meeting are also cadres, who are working with other cadres to lead the masses to get the work done. These heroes are also model cadres. Cadres and heroes both serve the masses, lead the masses to complete certain undertakings, and seek benefits for the masses. The heroes who attended this meeting, whether they are heroes in killing enemies, production, anti-traitors, or overturning, are first and foremost able to learn from the masses, be good at listening to and concentrating the opinions of the masses, be good at concentrating the creativity of the masses, and be good at obtaining leadership support. At this meeting, seven villages had both heroes and model workers attending at the same time, which shows that they are combined together and working together on certain undertakings.

　　Secondly, the heroes and model cadres who attended this meeting can all be honest, realistic, and have a calculating style. For example, the enemy-killing heroes scout the enemy, understand the internal situation of the enemy, and then attack the enemy based on this; the heroes of overturning investigate the objects of struggle, understand the conspiracies and tricks of the landlords, and grasp the ideological emotions of the masses; the labor heroes also often understand the problems and difficulties of mutual aid groups, understand the ideological emotions of the group members, and make plans according to each family, even make five-year plans. These are the honest and realistic attitude and style, which is worth promoting.

　　Again, the heroes of this time all have the spirit of self-criticism and accepting criticism from the masses. Many labor heroes, when rectifying mutual aid, first self-criticize in the mutual aid group. And solicit opinions from the masses. They are selfless, let the masses use the cattle awarded by the public, and give priority to others in exchanging labor; enemy-killing, overturning, and anti-traitor heroes can all do this, letting the masses supervise themselves, so they become heroes. If one cannot do this: not learning from the masses, not concentrating the opinions of the masses, not being honest, and not being able to accept criticism, one cannot gain the support of the masses and become a hero. The heroes who attended the meeting are all able to be with the masses, unite the broad masses, cultivate, help, and lead a group of new heroes to work together, so that the new heroism can be further developed. The old heroes of 1944 have all done this, and even if they are not re-elected this time, they are still heroes.

　　At this conference, the heroes summarized the achievements of all aspects in the past two years, exchanged various valuable experiences, to further promote various tasks, and prepare a full counter-offensive force for the patriotic self-defense war. In the future, we will further carry out overturning, killing enemies, production, and other movements, not only preparing for the counter-offensive, but also supporting the long-term war, and also preparing for the next Heroes' Conference. At the next conference, we will definitely have more heroes and more and better experiences.

    第三、不管大、小合作社两年来都建立了一套民主的、健全的领导制度、经济制度。正如农业互助解决了计工折工一套办法一样，这样才能巩固与发展组织。二十七个社的经验，入股、结账、分红都有一套办法。入股不限制，可以实物顶账，也能随时零星抽股，临时抽出的股，不分红，只当作存款给以一定的利息。结账、分红有定期，有的半年或一年、三个月、四个月，结一次分一次。期限长短与业务有关，如昔阳东丰稔合作社是一年一次，因为它主要是经营农业。壶关百尺合作社是铁业，有资金、有工人的劳力股，分红就是三月一次。邢台拆虎合作社以纺织为主，四月一次。合作社干部待遇也有一定，有的合作社只管吃，由村里给他家里代耕，分红时从红利中抽百分之五或十作酬劳金。有的与工人一样待遇，有的采供给制，再从红利中抽出一定比例作报酬，有的也顶成劳力股分红。总之，总有一定的经济制度，有账可算。同时每个合作社都选有理事会或监事会等，定期开会，集体领导。
    为群众服务，组织群众的生产与生活，大、小合作社必须互相帮助，互相发展。又建立有一整套民主的、健全的制度，这是发展合作社几个主要经验，也就是今后发展的好方针。
    三、纺织事业：
    战前本区纺织很少，是从生产渡荒中才发展起来的。当时是由合作社贷花，由公家不惜赔钱扶植起来的。几年来纺妇们大量地组织起来生产了，涌现了很多英雄、能手。组织规模与成绩都很大。如十七个县现在有纺妇廿八万四千多，比四三年大了六倍，比四四年大了三倍，如平顺等八县统计，有纺织妇女十二万五千多人（其中有一部分只会纺）。组织起来的就有八万九千多人，占百分之七十一到七十二。由于组织起来，不仅产量增加，技术也提高了。组织有三种形式，一为灯油互助组，是为了节省灯油组织起来集体纺织的，这在最初开展时最多。一种是纺织互助，即纺妇和织妇的变工互助，规定记工折工的办法，这种形式现在最多。第三种是小型工厂，如武安柏林妇女们今年每人拿一样多的棉花、资金参加进去，也记工折工，按分分红，这是一种。另一种工厂是小型合作形式，劳力资金都可以顶股，也记工折工，有一套领导办法，生产多，技术也容易提高。在这样组织起来的基础上，从今春到现在十个县的统计：织布三百零八万多斤，赚钱二万万五千八百多万元，是副业收入重要的一项。
    其次提高技术和质量，这次生产展览馆中所展览的各种花布、被面质量都很好。武安、沙河过去纺织技术就好，现在经过组织起来互相帮助、竞赛，更提高了一步。未组织起来以前，一斤棉花织成布需三个半到四个工，现在两个半工到三个就行了。另外工具的改良也很迅速，农村中土机在减少，手拉梭机一天天增加（当然纺织工具无论织机、纺车，总数比过去也大大增加了）。脚踏纺织机铁机等较好的工具也增加了。去年八个县统计，平均七个织妇有三架织机，其中百分之十四是手拉梭机。今年九个县统计，平均十一个织妇有五架织机，手拉梭机占百分之二十七。同时技术提高与师徒关系的改进也有关系。各地请老师，尊师爱徒鼓励了老师带徒弟的积极性。这次到会英雄差不多都当过老师带过徒弟，还到外村去教，这是很好的。以上讲的是提高技术与质量的问题，这在当前纺织运动中是很重要的。
    最后，发展纺织事业还有个原料问题与市场问题，由于植棉的推广，各地原料已大体解决了。但市场问题需要解决，这与合作、运销须结合好，这是主要的，另外，整个生产搞好了，群众生活提高了，市场也就扩大一些。比如李顺达作计划，感到要把时光过得更好就还需添置被子、衣服，这样群众生活要求一提高，布的市场也就扩大了。市场扩大了，也更能刺激生产向前发展。现在纺织的市场问题，合作英雄们应好好帮助，因为纺织是副业中很主要的一部分，以到会的十位纺织英雄统计，她们的收入相当于农业收入的百分之七十六。由于纺织的开展，妇女在社会、在家庭的地位都提高了，过去不和睦的家庭也和睦了。这次到会的纺织英雄，家庭关系都是很好的。
    纺织运动今后还应进一步发展，应更广泛的组织起来，改善家庭关系，继续提高技术改良工具，与合作运动、家庭副业如养鸡、养蚕、养猪等密切结合，像赵春花把纺织与家庭副业结合，组织全村妇女生产，就是很好范例。
    四、工商业：
    两年以来，本区工商业有很大的发展，特别是反攻以后，我们有了工矿区和城市。这也是生产运动的一个方面，是整个解放区经济不可缺少的一个方面，这主要是解放区城市建设问题。我们的城市虽然不多不大，我们也很重视，就是因为他的作用是大的，当然今天城市工商业是为整个解放区经济服务，为农村服务的。这次到会的模范经理，商人代表也都是这样作的，这是对的。那么，我们的主要经验是什么呢？
    第一、工商业生产的发展要与职工运动相结合。反攻后我们从敌伪手里收复了一些工矿区，首先发动了工人群众，解除了工人的压迫，提高了工人的觉悟，团结资方，尊重厂方，许多关于国民经济部门（军工部门的应作别论）的工厂如煤矿、铁工厂、纸厂等工人都参加了与厂方合作工厂管理。这就使工厂管理得更合理更好，工人生产积极性也提高了，如新华造纸厂工人参加管理后就提出精简，减少了一些脱离生产的干部，工人互相竞赛，每天每人出纸、晒纸都记账，对干部也是一个监督。工人经发动后，资方一般都能尊重工人意见，互相团结提高产量。如华丰铁厂、新华纸厂的生产都提高了一倍。特别是我们的军工部门，如长治炸弹所三个月完成了五个月的任务，甄荣典的炮弹造得更多了，他团结了工人，为支援前线积极增产，军工工人的努力，直接保证了自卫前线的弹药供给。许多商店也一样是发动店员后，东伙团结把买卖作得更好的。这就是劳资合作，工人与厂方团结共同来发展解放区的工商业。
    第二、工商业生产运动必须与改善工人生活相结合。有的工厂对工人采取分红制，有的奖励，凡是这样作的生产积极性都巩固了，生产一步步提高，质量也好，成本也就减低，生产水平也能保持。商店也一样。这就是劳资两利。除解决工资分红等问题而外，还应组织工人家属的生产，组织工人消费，如过去焦作新华公司未组织工人消费以前，每当发工资的时候，市场粮食即大涨，工资虽高，工人生活亦无法改善。后来组织了工人消费合作社，就把这个问题解决了。
    第三、组织工人的学习与文化娱乐生活，提高觉悟，建立新的劳动态度。这样就能保持既得成果，提高劳动强度。如焦作煤矿工人每天都有两小时学习，邢台的店员也是这样作的。
    现在我们有了城市，城乡工农的关系基本上是团结的。但过去的统治者制造了城乡的矛盾，直到现在仍有残余，这一点应引起我们的注意。工农过去同是被统治、受压迫的，现在都是解放区的主人翁，我们应普遍树立工农是一家的观念。
    上面所讲的是两年来太行区生产，大部分是老区的，部分新区今年也进行过生产运动，新区今冬彻底完成耕者有其田翻透了身之后，明年也要组织起来开展生产运动，努力赶上老区，把新区老区形成一个大生产运动的整体，把生产成绩作得超过已往任何一年。
    第四个问题：英雄、干部与群众
    这次大会出席的英雄、模范都比上届多，到会的模范工作者有二十一位，比上届多得多。这些模范工作者毫无例外都是通过一定的事业，成为模范的，都有他们的专长。他们帮助英雄，带领群众把工作作好，他们自己同样也是英雄。而到会的英雄大部也是干部，是与其他干部在一起带领群众把工作搞起来的，这些英雄也是模范干部。干部与英雄都是为群众服务，带领群众完成一定事业，为群众谋福利的。这次到会的英雄，无论杀敌、生产、反奸、翻身英雄，首先都是能向群众学习，善于倾听、集中群众的意见，善于集中群众的创造，又善于取得领导上的帮助的。这次大会有七个村是有英雄、又有模范工作者同时出席，可见他们是互相结合在一起共同在一定的事业上共同努力的。
    其次，这次到会的英雄、模范干都能老老实实，实事求是，有计算作风。如杀敌英雄他们侦察敌人，了解敌人内部情形，然后根据这些打击敌人；翻身英雄调查斗争对象，了解地主的阴谋鬼计，掌握群众的思想情绪；劳动英雄也经常了解互助组问题、困难，了解组员的思想情绪以及作按家计划，甚至订五年计划等。这些，就是老老实实，实事求是的态度与作风，是值得发扬的。
    再次，这次的英雄都是有自我批评与接受群众批评的精神的。许多劳动英雄，他们在整顿互助时，都是在互助组里首先自我批评。并征求群众意见。他们大公无私，把公家奖的牛让群众用，变工是先给别人受；杀敌、翻身、反奸英雄都是能这样作的，让群众监督自己，因之他们成为英雄。不能这样：不向群众学习，不去集中群众意见，不老实，不能接受批评，就不能得到群众拥护，成为英雄。到会的英雄们都是能与群众在一起，团结广大的群众，培养、帮助和带领一批新的英雄共同干的，这样新英雄主义才得到进一步的发展。四四年的老英雄都这样作了，他们这次即使没有再当选，但他们仍不失为英雄。
    这次大会众英雄们总结了各方面两年来的成绩，交流了各种宝贵的经验，来进一步推动各种工作，为爱国自卫战争准备饱满的反攻力量，今后我们将进一步开展翻身、杀敌、生产等运动，不单是准备了反攻，且为支持长期的战争，也是为下一届群英会作准备，下届大会我们一定有更多的英雄，更多更好的经验。
