Taihang First and Third Military Sub-district Troops
Seize Combat Intervals for Training
[This newspaper's Changzhi 30th dispatch] Local troops in the Taihang area are seizing combat intervals to conduct training. The "203" unit of the Third Military Sub-district has achieved good results by training while fighting. Two hours before the battle at Zhao’s Village in Tangyin on the 2nd of this month, the unit was still practicing on the reserve position. When the battle began, their combat movements were extremely skilled, casualties were minimal, and the battle was resolved quickly. The day after the battle, they immediately began practicing village warfare, breaking through courtyard walls, setting up ladders, etc., and integrating the areas where they were not proficient in combat and new characteristics of utilizing terrain with the training. After receiving the "blitz training" task from the leaders of the First Military Sub-district at the beginning of the year, each company of the "Huaihe" unit is currently rushing to create training plans. Everyone has put forward the slogan "Fear not the cold, fear not the frost, seize the time to hone our skills." To coordinate with the training, the propaganda team comrades have composed a "Sharpening the Knife" song. New recruit Ning Genxian received several letters from home urging him to return for his wedding, but he told his superiors, "Marriage is a personal matter, while training and sharpening our knives is a national matter." More than ten comrades, including Guo Fugen, attended classes while sick. When the instructor tried to dissuade them, they replied, "If we delay learning skills now, we won’t have the ability to become heroes in killing the enemy in the future." Everyone's enthusiasm for learning is extremely high. After half a month of hard training, nine comrades including Li Kaikun, Zheng Fuqi, and Zhen Detiao can now continuously lift their rifles two thousand to four thousand times.

    太行一、三分区部队
    抓紧战斗间隙练兵
    【本报长治三十日电】太行区地方兵团，抓紧战斗间隙进行练兵。三分区“二○三”部队一面战斗一面练兵，已获得良好成绩。本月二日汤阴赵家厂战斗前两个钟头，该部仍在预备阵地上演习。战斗开始后，战斗动作极为熟练，且伤亡甚小，解决战斗快。战斗结束后第二天，随又开始演习村落战，突院墙，架梯子等，并摆其战斗中不熟练部分及利用地形地物上的新特点，与练兵结合进行。一分区“槐河”部队，于年初接到分区首长“突击练兵”任务后，各连队正赶订练兵计划，大家提出口号是“不怕冻，不怕冷，抓紧时间练本领。”宣传队同志们，为配合练兵，已编出“磨刀”歌。新战士宁根贤同志，家里连来数信，要他回去结婚，他向上级说：“结婚是私人小事，练兵磨刀是国家大事。”郭富根等十余个同志，带病到课，指导员劝阻他们，他们的回答是：“现在误了学本领，将来想当杀敌英雄就没本钱。”大家学习情绪极高，经半月苦练，李开坤、郑富起、甄德迢等九同志，举枪已能连达二千至四千次。
