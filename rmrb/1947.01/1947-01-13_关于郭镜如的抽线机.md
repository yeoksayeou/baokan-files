　　Regarding Comrade Hao Guofan's Inquiry About Guo Jingru's Drawing Machine:
    You asked for details about the drawing machine created by Mr. Guo Jingru. We have received a letter from Mr. Guo, but unfortunately, it only discussed the various parts and materials, without explaining the operational details. However, after our study, we believe we can answer your questions based on the information available.
    1. This machine is divided into seventeen parts, and its structure is relatively simple. It is made of materials such as iron and wood. The principle is roughly to put cotton into a small bucket, which is mounted on a wooden barrel. It is connected to a flywheel to make it rotate, drawing the yarn and winding it onto a rotating bobbin. A weight controls the thickness of the yarn. This is similar to the principle of a general spinning machine, but it is made with local materials and painstaking effort.
    2. This machine can draw twenty-two threads. Each person can produce up to six catties of yarn per day, and generally four to five catties.
    As for detailed structural drawings, usage methods, selling prices, and procedures, the original reply did not provide details. Please write to Xingtai Jingxing Iron Factory for direct discussion!

### 关于郭镜如的抽线机

　　关于郭镜如的抽线机郝国藩同志：
    你问郭镜如先生创制的抽线机详情，我们已经得到郭先生来函，可惜只谈了各部机构及材料，未说明运用详情，但经我们研究后，觉得也可以据以回答你的问题。
    一、此机共分十七部，构造还算简单，是用铁、木等材料造的。原理大概是把棉花装在小桶里，小桶装置在一木桶上，连接飞轮使他旋转，抽出线来缠在转动着的线葫芦上用重锤司线的粗细。这和一般纺纱机的原理相仿，不过是用本地材料，苦心配制起来的。
    二、此机可抽二十二根线，成手每天每人最高可出六斤线，一般可抽四五斤。
    至于其构造详细图样及使用方法，出卖价目及办法等，原复函未详，请函邢台镜兴铁工厂，直接商讨吧！
