Changzhi Breaks Complacency, Penetrates Backward Layers
Repeatedly Investigates Hidden Landlords
Discovers Hundreds of Landlords in Eighteen Villages Not Thoroughly Struggled Against
[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 7th] Changzhi County Party Secretary Wang Zongqi reported: Due to the resolution of ideological problems of cadres from top to bottom, Changzhi County has vigorously launched a great check on turning over. In early December, the county sub-districts convened a conference of more than 2,000 village cadres and activists to examine past mass movements and discovered many problems. Subsequently, on the 10th, a county and district cadre meeting was held to study in detail the issues raised at the district and village cadre meetings. It was immediately decided to conduct a universal examination of turning over, proposing: "A thousand years of grievances should be avenged at once, whatever is lacking should be divided, and the trenches should be filled." "Do not forget poor friends when turning over, mobilize the backward to struggle together." "Discussion meetings change minds; if thinking is not clear, turning over cannot be achieved." After county and district cadres had clear minds and clear goals, they immediately went down to mobilize the examination. On the 15th, the districts held a second conference of village cadres and activists. Based on the inspection over ten days, the examination and mobilization were further unfolded: (1) Break the complacency and thoroughly launch the movement to investigate landlords. After a specific investigation at the Fourth District village cadre meeting, it was found that 102 landlord households in eighteen administrative villages had not been thoroughly liquidated. (2) In the inspection, it was generally found that landlords were doing everything possible to sabotage and resist the peasants' turning-over movement. The landlord of Lingshang Village in the Second District used his daughter to seduce cadres, and twelve activists attempted to evade struggle. The landlord of Xinyi Village bribed agricultural association cadres, sending a shi and two of wheat in the spring, zongzi and meat during the Dragon Boat Festival, and mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The landlords Zhang Ersong and Wang Diankui in Handian gave thirty-two mu of land to relatives and family members to evade struggle. Shen Daju, a landlord in Sudian, used his hired worker Han Guiwang to help him divide things when distributing fruits. (3) From checking the turning over to making up for deficiencies, guide the peasants to thoroughly liquidate the landlords. At the member meeting of the Henghe Agricultural Association in the Fourth District, the members discussed filling in and making up for what was lacking, and everyone put forward what they lacked. In the discussion, the peasants consciously demanded a thorough liquidation of the landlords. (4) Deepen the mobilization of the backward layers. The entire village cadres and activists in Sudian conducted door-to-door inspections and mobilizations. Feng Geng, chairman of the Beitianhe Agricultural Association, helped fifteen households to clear their minds within three days. Zhang Zhaogen, a turning-over hero in Yuanjia Village, helped thirty households, all of whom grasped the pain points of each poor person to enlighten them, and the backward peasants of the past have become active. The three grievance meetings in Sudian each had more than 400 people. Activists said: "This year's strength is much greater than last winter!" In order to enlighten the peasants' consciousness, the Second and Third Districts exhibited the fruits of the struggle, and now the villages are carrying out a great examination of turning over in a vigorous manner.
