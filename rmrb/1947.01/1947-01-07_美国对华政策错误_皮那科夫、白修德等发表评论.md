Xinhua News Agency report: Soviet observer Pinakov, commentator Grishanin, and New Republic correspondent Theodore White have each criticized US policy toward China.

Pinakov, in an essay published in "International Review," stated: "American imperialists do not want to abandon their assistance to the Chinese reactionaries because the Chinese reactionaries are the vanguard protecting their interests. According to reliable information, the US Marines remaining in China, the First Division alone has more than 20,000 people, and the number of the Third Division and the troops 'coming to China for rest' is unknown. According to London's 'World News and Reviews' magazine, a large number of aircraft and a staggering amount of artillery, mortars, machine guns, and various other military equipment were transported to China. From the end of 1945 to June 1946 alone, the Kuomintang received American military supplies worth more than $1.335 billion, which is equivalent to twice the amount of US military aid given during China's eight-year war of resistance. From then until the autumn of 1946, the Kuomintang additionally obtained $850 million from the United States, specifically for the purchase of combat equipment. After Japan surrendered, the United States transported 300,000 Kuomintang troops to the Northeast and 160,000 troops to North China to wage civil war. This extremely incomplete information is enough to prove American armed intervention in China."

Grishanin commented: "Truman's current statement is aimed at the growing domestic and international discontent with current US actions in China." The November "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" opened the doors of China to American goods, and the Chinese Kuomintang government became a debtor to the United States.

Theodore White's essay is entitled: "The Misguided American Policy Towards China." He said: "The American policy toward China is a big joke that extremely malicious politicians have played on China. The history of American policy toward China reads like a page torn from a 'Compendium of Errors.' It makes America appear to have an attitude toward the world of half-hope and half-malice. After making a solemn declaration on December 16th two years ago, Truman transported troops to the Nanjing government and gave the Chiang government 271 warships, providing him with 200 billion yuan of Lend-Lease supplies, 30 billion yuan of surplus materials, and tens of billions of yuan of relief supplies. Most of the Kuomintang soldiers on the civil war battlefield rode in American trucks and cars, flew American planes, and fired American guns and cannons. Marshall verbally preached peaceful mediation, but in practice acted as if he was participating in the war.

White concluded in his essay: What we need to do now is to truly implement Truman's statement of December 16, 1944, stop all military aid to Chiang, stop training Chinese officers, stop defending Chinese railways, and stop transporting troops for the Kuomintang."

    美国对华政策错误
    皮那科夫、白修德等发表评论
    【本报综合报导】据新华社讯：苏联观察家皮那科夫、评论家格里沙宁、美国新共和周刊特派员白修德，分别批评美国对中国的政策。
    皮那科夫发表在“国际评论”的论文说：美国的帝国主义分子，不想抛弃对中国反动派的帮助，因为中国反动派是保护他们利益的先锋队。根据可靠的情报：美国留在中国的海军陆战队，单只第一师就有两万多人，第三师和“开到中国来休息”的部队还不知道有多少。根据伦敦“世界新闻与评论”杂志报导：大批的飞机和数量惊人的大炮、掷弹筒、机关枪和各种其他军事装备品运到中国，只是从一九四五年底到四六年六月这一段时间，国民党所收到的美国军事供应品值价达十三亿三千五百万美元以上，这就相当于中国八年抗战期间美国所给予军事援助的两倍，而从那时起直到四六年秋天，国民党还另外获得美国的八亿五千万美元，专供购买作战装备之用。日本投降以后，美国把三十万国民党军队运到东北去，十六万军队运到华北去，以便进行内战。这种极不完全的资料，就很够证明美国武装干涉中国了。
    格里沙宁的评论说：“杜鲁门目前的声明，是针对目前美国在华行动引起国内外日益不满的情绪的”。十一月的“中美商约”替美国货开放了中国的门户，中国国民党政府变成美国的债务人。
    白修德的论文题目叫做：“迷途的美国对华政策”。他说：“美国对中国的政策，是恶毒万分的政治家对中国开了一个大玩笑。美国对中国政策的历史，读起来像从一本“错误大全”中撕下来的一页。使美国表现出对世界抱了半怀希望半怀恶意的态度。杜鲁门在前年十二月十六日作了庄严的声明后，却又给南京政府运兵，并赠给蒋政府二百七十一艘军舰，供给他二十万万元租借物资，三万万元剩余物资，几万万元的救济物资。内战战场上的大多数国民党士兵，乘着美国的卡车汽车，驾着美国的飞机，发射着美国的枪炮。马歇尔在口头上空言和平调处，实际行动却似参加战争。
    白修德在他的论文中结语说：我们现在要做的是在真正实现一九四四年十二月十六日杜鲁门声明，停止一切军事援蒋，不再训练中国军官，不再防卫中国铁路及为国民党运送军队。
