[This report] According to TASS, Moscow, 16th: The Soviet steel industry, having victoriously completed the first year of the Five-Year Plan, is facing huge new tasks. Pavel Krobov, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Steel Industry and Hero of Socialist Labor, told a TASS reporter: The output of pig iron, steel, and rolled metal will exceed the 1946 figures by 14 percent. The output of southern factories will increase by 50 percent. The eight blast furnaces, twenty-one open-hearth furnaces, ten coke plants, seven mines, and many foundries and electric furnaces that have now been restored will begin operation. The "Zaporozhye Steel Plant's" blast furnace, one of the world's largest, the Soviet Union's most powerful rail mill, and other units will all be restored in the South this year. The Makeyevka Steel Plant, which suffered severe destruction during the war, will reach its pre-war output in 1947. In addition, 75 or 80 percent of the steel industry in various parts of southern Soviet Union, which suffered severe destruction during the war, will be restored by the end of this year. The first part of the steel plant will start operating in the Transcaucasus. A powerful blast furnace will start operating in Nizhny Tagil in the Urals, which will produce as much special steel for rails as all Soviet factories currently produce. New mines will be opened in the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly area, the Kola Peninsula, and the Urals, outside the Arctic Circle. 22.8 million rubles have been allocated for further mechanization of steel plants, which will greatly improve the quality of metal produced by more than 25 percent of steel mills. Several furnaces will be built to produce steel directly from ore without the dust-smelting step, and several specialized schools and vocational schools will open to train talent for the steel industry.

　　苏联钢铁积极增产
    战时被毁钢铁工厂将在今年恢复
    大批熔矿炉炼焦厂不久可望开工
    【本报讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：已经胜利完成五年计划中第一年计划的苏联钢铁工业，巨大的新任务正摆在它的面前。苏联钢铁工业部副部长、社会主义劳动英雄巴维尔·克罗波夫告塔斯社记者称：生铁、钢及卷金属之产量将要超过一九四六年数字百分之十四。南方诸厂的产量将增加百分之五十，现在已恢复的八座鼓风炉，二十一座西门——马丁式熔矿炉，十个炼焦厂，七个矿场以及许多铸造厂和电熔炉将开工。“萨波罗什钢铁厂”的世界最大之一的鼓风炉，力量最大的苏维埃轧轨厂以及另外的单位，今年都将在南方恢复。战争时期遭受严重摧毁的马卡耶夫卡钢铁工厂，将在一九四七年达到战前产量。此外，在战时遭受严重摧毁的苏联南部各地的钢铁工业，百分之七十五或八十将要在今年底恢复。钢铁工厂之第一部分，将在外高加索开工。强有力的鼓风炉，将在乌拉尔的下塔吉尔开工，它将生产和苏联所有各工厂现在产量一样多的用作铁轨的特种钢。新的矿坑，将要在库尔斯克磁铁矿区，克拉半岛及乌拉尔、北极圈外开工。二万二千八百万卢布已拨作钢铁工厂生产更进一步机械化之用，百分之二十五以上的炼钢厂，将因此大大的改进所产金属的品质。几个不通过熔尘步骤由矿苗直接产钢的熔炉将要建立，几个专门学校和职业学校将要开学为钢铁工业训练人材。
