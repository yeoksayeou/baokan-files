Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Shanghai report: The China Democratic League held its 5th preparatory meeting of the Second Plenary Session last month on the 31st to discuss two documents: protesting against the atrocities of the US military and opposing the Kuomintang's one-party "constitution." Regarding the constitution issue, after discussion, a formal statement was issued on New Year's Day: denouncing the illegality of the Kuomintang's one-party "constitution" and its implementation measures, and resolutely opposing it. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　Since its establishment, the China Democratic League has advocated ending the Kuomintang's one-party tutelage and implementing constitutionalism. However, in view of the history of past constitutional failures in China, this League firmly believes that the implementation of constitutionalism must be premised on national peace, and especially respects the constitutional drafting body, in order to truly achieve the goal of realizing constitutionalism. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and it is also a sacred and dignified common contract of the people of the whole country. This contract must be based on the common will of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the National Assembly for drafting the constitution must be a meeting that representatives of the people of the whole country are willing to participate in together. Only when the people have the right to jointly discuss and formulate the constitution, can the people have the obligation to jointly abide by it. Only a constitution produced in a democratic and unified manner can have truly democratic content, and only then can the constitution have real effect. Based on this general principle, the China Democratic League has the following points to declare regarding the constitution announced today:

　　First, the National Assembly held on November 15, 1946, violated the procedures and spirit of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolution and was a constitutional convention convened in such manner. The most important part of the PCC resolution was to first establish a coalition government of all parties, and then have this government, united as one, jointly convene the National Assembly to draft a constitution and jointly shoulder the responsibility of implementing constitutionalism. This resolution's procedure and spirit have been completely destroyed by the government. The China Democratic League, standing on the position of safeguarding the PCC, refused to participate in this National Assembly. Therefore, this League reserves the right to accept the constitution announced today.

　　Second, according to the PCC resolution, the National Assembly must be based on the constitutional draft principles jointly negotiated by the PCC. However, the draft unilaterally proposed by the Kuomintang is not the PCC draft in either law or fact. The foundation of constitutionalism is the rule of law, and the most important condition for the rule of law is to abide by the rules. The so-called constitution has lost its legal basis, and those who create laws illegally cannot provide a guarantee of abiding by the law to others. Furthermore, in terms of the content of the so-called constitution, many important articles are unresolved issues disputed by the PCC and are far from true democratic principles. The Democratic League, standing on the position of striving for true democracy in China, reserves the right to accept this constitution.

　　Third, in addition to formulating the so-called "constitution," this National Assembly also passed the so-called "implementation of the constitution" ten articles. In these measures, it is stipulated that in the future, when the National Assembly representatives, the Legislative Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan committees reach two-thirds of the number of people elected, meetings can be convened to implement constitutional rule. This provision is clearly using the name of drafting and implementing the constitution to prepare for long-term civil war and permanent division. This is truly a premeditated attempt by the government to abandon peace and unity. Without peace and unity in the country, the country will never have constitutionalism and a democratic government. Such measures fundamentally violate the principles of this League and fundamentally conflict with the interests of the people. This League is willing to awaken the people of the whole country to jointly and resolutely oppose it.

### 民主同盟发表声明  坚决反对蒋记“宪法”  指斥所谓“行宪”是长期内战

　　民主同盟发表声明
    坚决反对蒋记“宪法”
    指斥所谓“行宪”是长期内战
    【新华社延安十二日电】沪讯：中国民主同盟于上月三十一日举行二中全会第五次预备会，讨论抗议美军暴行及反对国民党一党“宪法”两项文件。关于宪法问题，经讨论后，于元旦日正式发表声明：指斥国民党一党“宪法”及其实施办法之非法，予以坚决反对。声明全文如下：
    中国民主同盟从成立以来，就主张应结束国民党的一党训政，实行宪政，但本同盟鉴于中国过去宪法失败的历史，故坚决主张实施宪政必以国家的和平为先决条件，而尤特别尊重制宪机关，以期真能达到实现宪政之目的。宪法为国家的根本大法，同时亦是全国人民一种神圣尊严的共同契约。此种契约必以全国人民共同意志为基础。所以制宪的国民大会必须为全国人民代表所愿共同参加的一种会议。人民对宪法有了共议共制的权利，而后人民有共遵共守的义务，只有用民主统一的方式产生的宪法，而后宪法才能有真正民主的内容，而后宪法才能发生真正的效力。依据这个大原则，中国民主同盟对今天公布之宪法，有下列几点声明：
    第一，民国三十五年十一月十五日举行的国民大会，是违背了政治协商决议的程序与精神而召开的一种制宪会议。政协决议中最重要的一项，是先成立各党派的联合政府，而后由此一举国一致的政府共同召集国民大会以制定宪法，共同担负实施宪政的责任，这种决议程序与精神已被政府完全破坏了。中国民主同盟站在维护政协的立场，拒绝参加此次国大。因此，本同盟对今天公布的宪法愿保留其接受的权利。
    第二，根据政协决议，国民大会必须依据政协共同协商的宪草原则。再国民党片面提出的草案，在法律与事实上均非政协宪草。宪政的基础是法治，而法治最重要的条件是守法则，所谓宪法已失去了法律根据，而违法造法者必不能示人以守法之保证。更就所谓宪法之内容来说，许多重要条文既为政协争议未决之问题，且与真正的民主原则相距甚远。民盟站在争取中国真正民主的立场，愿保留其接受此项宪法之权利。
    第三，此次国大除制定所谓“宪法”外，又曾通过所谓“行宪”办法十条，在此项办法中，竟规定将来国大代表立法院及监察院委员会选达三分之二的人数时，即可召集会议，实行宪政。此种规定显系假借制宪行宪之名，为长期内战永久分裂作准备，此实政府决心放弃和平与团结之预谋。国家没有和平与团结，则国家永远没有宪政与民主政府，此种措施与本同盟之主张根本违背，更与人民之利益根本冲突，本同盟愿唤起全国人民共同坚决反对。
