Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. Changsha Dispatch: A shocking flour bribery case involving 900 million yuan occurred here in late last month. Yu Jichuan, Director of the Hunan Branch of the Jiang government's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), in order to conceal his embezzlement and malfeasance, colluded with the municipal government to distribute 1,500 bags of flour to various news agencies and press in Changsha, in an attempt to silence them. The Changsha branch of the Central News Agency received 100 tons, the Journalists Association received 80 tons, and various official news agencies received 80 tons. Calculated at the then market price of 600,000 yuan per ton of flour in Changsha, the bribery and embezzlement amounted to 900 million yuan, causing great resentment among the citizens. Even more than ten members of the Guomindang's puppet Provincial Assembly exposed the inside story of the administration's malfeasance and bribery. Currently, Yu Jichuan and others are busy hosting dinners and engaging in various activities in an attempt to mitigate the situation.

    长沙发生贪污巨案
    蒋记行总舞弊九亿元
    【新华社延安二十七日电】长沙讯：上月下旬，此间发生一轰动全国数达九万万元的面粉贿赂案。蒋政府行总湖南分署署长余籍传，为掩蔽其舞弊中饱劣迹，竟会同市政府将一千五百袋面粉分给长沙各新闻通讯社，以掩其口。中央社长沙分社得一百吨，记者公会得八十吨，各官方通讯社得八十吨。按当时长沙面粉市价六十万元一吨算，舞弊贿赂数字即达九万万元，当引起市民极大愤懑，甚至国民党御用之省参议会也有参议员十余人揭发该署舞弊黑幕与行贿事实。现余籍传等正纷纷请客，多方活动，企图缓和此事。
