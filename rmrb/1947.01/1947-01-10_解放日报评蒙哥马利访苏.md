    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 8th: The Liberation Daily here published a commentary entitled "Montgomery's Visit to the Soviet Union," stating: "This event is welcomed by the people of both Britain and the Soviet Union, and should also be welcomed by the Chinese people and peace-loving democrats around the world." "Because this sincere friendly relationship between the Anglo-Soviet allies will be an important factor for world peace." Reviewing Anglo-Soviet relations since September of last year, the commentary wrote: "Due to the Soviet Union's implementation of a firm international peace policy, the increasingly severe oppression of American imperialism, and the British people's own awareness and struggle, British relations with the Soviet Union have recently shown signs of gradual improvement." "This time, it is starting with commercial and diplomatic aspects and moving towards closer military ties." The commentary examined Bevin's foreign policy over the past year and more, writing: "The foreign policy of Britain's Attlee and Bevin, as Bevin himself said, inherited the mantle of the Conservative Party. They rely on American imperialism to oppose the Soviet Union, to oppose the independence and liberation of weak countries and colonial peoples, and it is recently rumored that the British and American general staffs have reached an agreement on standardized military training preparations and air force cooperation. If the aforementioned agreement is true, then its only possible practical result will not be any real attack on the Soviet Union, but simply that Britain will be reduced to an appendage of American imperialism." However, "this reactionary policy of the British authorities is bound to and has already been resolutely opposed by the British people." Because "they respect the allied Soviet Union in the anti-fascist war, they oppose being a tail of the United States, and they believe that "if the British Labor government becomes a tool of Wall Street, it will become a threat to the world." They do not want to be implicated in the impending economic crisis in the United States." Even in November of last year, 48 percent of Labor Party members of Parliament opposed Bevin's "pro-American and anti-Soviet" policy. The British people's pressure on Bevin's reactionary foreign policy will increase, and the Labor government's foreign policy will be difficult to remain unchanged. This is definitely certain.

    解放日报评蒙哥马利访苏
    【新华社延安八日电】此间解放日报发表《蒙哥马利访苏》时评称：“这件事受到英苏两国人民的欢迎，也应该受到中国人民和全世界和平民主人士的欢迎”。“因为英苏盟邦这一诚挚的友好关系，将是世界和平的一个重要因素”。时评在追述自去年九月以来的英苏关系时写道：“由于苏联实行了坚强的国际和平政策，由于美国帝国主义的压迫日益严重，再由于英国人民自身的觉悟与奋斗，英国的对苏关系近来已露出了逐渐改进的端倪”，“这次则是从商务、外交方面开始，走向军事关系上的接近。”时评检讨一年多来贝文外交政策时写道：“英国阿特里和贝文的外交政策，正像贝文自己所说是继承了保守党的衣钵。他们依靠美帝国主义来反对苏联、反对弱小国家和殖民地人民的独立解放，最近且盛传英美参谋部已订立了关于军事训练准备标准化和空军合作的协定。上述协定如果是事实，那么其唯一可能的实际结果，将不是苏联遭到什么真实的进攻，而只是英国将降为美国帝国主义的附属国”。但是“英国当局的这种反动政策必然而且已经受到英国人民坚决的反对”。因为“他们敬爱反法西斯战争中的盟邦苏联，他们反对做美国的尾巴，他们认为“英国工党政府如果做了华尔街的工具，就将成为世界的威胁”。他们不愿被美国行将到来的经济危机所牵累”。甚至在去年十一月间，百分之四十八的工党议员都反对贝文这种“媚美反苏”政策，英国人民对贝文反动外交政策的压力，将越来越大，工党政府的外交政策，势难一成不变，这是确定不移的了。
