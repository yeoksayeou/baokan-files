　　Student Representatives Vociferously Oppose Atrocities by U.S. Troops in Beiping
　　Mass representatives spoke in succession. Zhao Hanxi from Zhao Village, Wu'an, said: The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army led us in the eight-year war of resistance to defeat the Japanese devils. Now, Chiang Kai-shek is colluding with the United States to harm us. We must unite as one to protect our gains after land reform. Qiao Liang, a member of the Wu'an Nan Ye Tao Farmers' Association, waved his strong fist and said: Chiang Kai-shek wants to sell us, the common people, into becoming subjugated slaves. We resolutely oppose it and demand that American soldiers get out of China like Japanese soldiers. Representatives of the County Normal School and Qiao Meiyuan, a female student from the Wu'an Ninth Elementary School, both spoke, unanimously condemning the atrocities of the U.S. military and supporting the patriotic protest movement of students in the Chiang-controlled areas. Hao Ying rushed to the loudspeaker and said angrily: Make the American soldiers get out quickly and stop bullying our women.
　　At 3 p.m., the conference passed proposals to designate November 4th as National Humiliation Memorial Day, to include it in textbooks, and to fly flags at half-mast. The meeting adjourned amidst slogans such as "Abolish the Chiang-U.S. Commercial Treaty," "Let the U.S. Military Get Out of China," "Support the Patriotic Movement of Students in Peiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai," "Spare No Effort to Support the Front Lines and Strive to Eliminate Another Forty-Five Brigades of Chiang Kai-shek," and "Strive to Realize the Political Consultative Conference Line and the Military Positions of January 13th Last Year."

　　学生代表大声疾呼反对北平美军兽行
    群众代表相继讲话。武安赵庄村赵汉西说：共产党八路军领导咱们抗战八年，才把日本鬼子打败了，蒋介石又勾引美国来坑害咱们，咱们要团结成“一圪蛋”，保卫翻身利益。武安南冶陶农会员乔亮挥动着他的粗壮的拳头说：蒋介石要出卖咱老百姓当亡国奴，咱坚决反对，叫美国兵像日本兵一样滚出中国去。县立师范学生代表与武安第九高小女生乔美元讲话，都一致痛斥美军兽行，声援蒋区学生爱国抗议运动。郝英气冲冲的跑到播音器前面说：叫美国兵赶快滚出去，不让他再欺侮咱们妇女。
    下午三时，通过大会通电，订定十一月四日为国耻纪念日，并编入课本，下半旗等提案，在“废除蒋美商约”，“让美军滚出中国去”，“援助平津京沪学生的爱国运动”，“竭力支援前线，为再消灭蒋介石四十五个旅而奋斗”，“为实现政协路线及去年一月十三日军事位置而奋斗”等口号声中散会。
