　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st -- Moscow dispatch: The international observer of "Truth" newspaper, in summarizing the past year, wrote that the abundant international events of 1946 occupied a special position. The people of the whole world, who were drawn into the whirlpool of World War II, have only approached peaceful construction this year. The war has changed many European countries. The United Nations Organization, which has launched intensified activities, has encountered great difficulties on its path. However, even the most pessimistic critics cannot but admit that the United Nations Organization has achieved some success as it approaches the New Year of 1947. The UN General Assembly's decision on universal disarmament is of great significance for the entire post-war peace and international security. The Foreign Ministers' Conference reached an agreement on the five-nation treaty at the end of this year. Although there were differences of opinion among the major powers, it proved that they could find a common language on many difficult issues and ensure unanimous decisions. This is not only the achievement of 1946 but also the lesson of 1947. The first year after the war vividly demonstrated that the Soviet Union's international role and prestige have been greatly enhanced. This is because of its great and lofty actions in the struggle for the cause of world peace.

　　苏联声誉提高赢得胜利
    世界人民接近和平建设
    真理报评国际一年
    【新华社延安三十一日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家在概述过去一年的总结时写道，一九四六年丰富的国际事变占据着特别的地位，卷入第二次世界大战漩涡的全世界人民，在今年才接近了和平建设，战争使许多欧洲国家发生了变化。已展开强化活动的联合国组织，在其道路上遇到了巨大的困难，然而最忧郁的批评家也不能不承认联合国组织在接近一九四七年的新年时已达到某些成功：联大关于普遍裁军的决定对于整个战后和平与国际安全是具有重大意义的，外长会议于今年年底关于五国和约达到了协议，各大强国虽然存有意见分歧，但证明能够对许多繁难的问题找到共同语言，并保证协商一致的决定，这不仅是一九四六年的成果，而且也是一九四七年的教训。战后的第一年生动的证明了苏联的国际作用与声誉已大大提高，这是因为它在争取全世界和平事业斗争中的巨大崇高行动所赢得的。
