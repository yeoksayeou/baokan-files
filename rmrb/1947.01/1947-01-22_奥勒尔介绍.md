　　Introduction to Auriol
　　Auriol, the first president of the Fourth Republic of France, was born in Rivel, Aude province, in August 1884. He initially studied law and political science in Toulouse, and soon engaged in political activities, joining the French Socialist Party. After the end of World War I, he was sent to attend the peace conference. In 1928, Auriol briefly served as the leader of the Socialist Party, and after Blum became the party leader, Auriol served as the party's general secretary. When Blum formed his second cabinet in 1938, he served as the Minister of Liaison in the cabinet. In 1940, the French traitor Vichy government signed a peace treaty with the German army. Auriol withdrew from political life and was arrested for voting against Pétain's dictatorship. After his release, he went into hiding. In October 1943, he secretly went to London. After returning to Paris, he served as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Algiers Constituent Assembly, then as the Minister of State, and also as one of the French representatives to the United Nations. From January to June 1946, he served as the chairman of the first Constituent Assembly, and later continued to serve in this position in the second Constituent Assembly. (Information Office)
