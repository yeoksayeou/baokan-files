International Week
    12th to 18th

    The world's attention has been focused on Europe in the past week.

    The elections for the President and Speakers of the two Houses of the French Fourth Republic are events of prime importance. This election is a major struggle between progressive and conservative forces in France. The right-wing Popular Republican Movement has already been defeated in the election of the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the general election. The reason is that the Communist Party supported the Socialist Party's candidate. This move has caused the right wing to consider that a new "Popular Front" may be formed. Negotiations are currently underway to form a formal government for a five-year term, the establishment of which will change the unstable state of France after the war.

    The improvement of Anglo-Soviet relations is due less to the wishes of some upper-level members of the British Labour Party (the Pravda's exposure of Bevin's hypocrisy in his Christmas speech is one explanation) than to the surging opposition of the British people and the Labour Party to Bevin's foreign policy in recent times. In the near future, this force will be further strengthened by the nationwide "Movement to Consolidate Anglo-Soviet Friendship" led by the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association. Concrete steps must be taken to improve Anglo-Soviet relations and safeguard world peace. To this end, British Labour MP Zilliacus has put forward a series of proposals: abolish the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, terminate its collusion on Anglo-American military cooperation, demobilize 500,000 British combat troops, invite the Soviet Union and France to jointly handle the Middle East issue, British troops withdraw from Greece, and that Britain, France and the Soviet Union adopt a common policy on the reconstruction of Germany and other issues in accordance with the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

    The resolution of the German and Austrian issues has been placed on the agenda of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London. This conference is to prepare for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 10, studying the opinions of various countries on the German and Austrian issues.

    In the past week, Britain has experienced its first major strike since the war. The initial cause of this strike was economic. However, its development has great political significance. On the tenth day of the strike, the number of people participating in sympathy strikes exceeded the number of original strikers. This shows the strength of solidarity and shared destiny of the British working class. The reason they have not held a major strike in more than a year since the war is only because they have taken the overall situation into consideration, hoping that Britain can quickly recover from the wounds of war. However, because the employers have been too oppressive, they have been forced to give a powerful counterattack. The great strength of the British workers demonstrated in this strike will ensure the victory of the strike. In Italy, the degeneration of the right wing of the Socialist Party will further strengthen the joint action of the Socialist and Communist Parties in Italian political life. The appointment of Basso, who advocates the merger of the Socialist and Communist Parties, as the Secretary of the Socialist Party is a sign. In Japan, the movement to overthrow the cabinet, led by the working class, is in full swing. The Yoshida government is facing a serious crisis.

### 国际一周  十二日至十八日

    国际一周
    十二日至十八日
    过去一周世界目光集中在欧洲。
    具有头等意义的事件是法兰西第四共和国总统及两院议长的选举。这一选举，是法国进步势力与保守势力之间的重大斗争。右派的人民共和运动党，已在国民议会议长与总的选举中被战败。原因是共产党支持社会党的候选人。此举已引起右派的考虑，他们认为这会使新的“人民阵线”有新的结成的可能。目前正商谈组织为期五年的正式政府问题，这一政府的成立，将改变法国在大战以后的不稳定状态。
    英苏关系趋向改善，与其说是某些英国工党上层人士的愿望（真理报揭示贝文圣诞演说的虚伪性即系一种说明），毋宁说是最近时期风起云涌的英国人民和工党内部反对贝文外交政策的结果。不久的将来，这一力量将因英苏友谊协会领导的全国性的“巩固英苏友谊的运动”之展开而更形加强。改善英苏关系和保障世界和平，必须采取具体步骤。对此，英国工党进步议员齐里人库斯已经提出一连串的建议：废除英美联合参谋委员会，终止其关于英美军二合作的勾当，英国作战部队复员五十万人，请苏法共同处理中东问题，英军退出希腊，以及根据英苏条约与法苏条约使英法苏在重建德国等问题上采取共同政策等等。
    德奥问题的解决，已经提到在伦敦开的四强外长代表会议的议程。该会议系为三月十日莫斯科外长会议作准备工作，研究各国对德奥问题的意见。
    过去一周，英国爆发了战后的首次大罢工。这一罢工的最初原因，是经济性的。但它的发展，却有很大的政治意义。在罢工的第十天，同情罢工的人数超过原有罢工的人数。这显示了英国工人阶级团结和休戚与共的力量。他们在战后一年多以来之所以未举行大罢工，只因顾全大局，希望英国能很快的恢复战争的创伤。但因为雇主欺压太甚，他们便被迫不得不给以有力地反击。这次罢工中所表示的英国工人的强大力量，将使罢工获得胜利。在意大利，社会党右派之蜕化将使社、共两党在意国政治生活中的联合行动更加强。由主张社共两党合并的巴索出任社会党的书记，即是一种征象。在日本，以工人阶级为主力的倒阁运动正方兴未艾。吉田政府正面临严重的危机。
