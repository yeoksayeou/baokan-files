    Student Strike in Chiang's Area
    Jin Gangsheng
    Folks, spread the word quickly:
    American devils are bullying us;
    Students everywhere have risen up,
    Striking and demonstrating, turning the world upside down.
    Christmas Eve, the day before,
    Two American soldiers were having a blast,
    Waiting at the movie theater entrance,
    Determined to have their way with Chinese women.
    A Miss Shen, a female student,
    Left the movie theater alone,
    Two beasts rushed up,
    One on the left, one on the right, they stopped her,
    Dragged her to the grove in the playground,
    Taking turns raping her.
    Some people saw it but didn't dare interfere,
    Reporting to the police who didn't budge,
    The American military police were invited,
    One grabbed one, and they scurried away.
    Poor seventeen-year-old Miss Shen,
    Unconscious and tearful,
    If you ask what school she attends?
    The preparatory class of Peking University;
    Where did this happen?
    In Beiping City, near Dongdan.
    Where did these American soldiers come from?
    Old Chiang begged them to come.
    Folks, think about it:
    How can people not be furious!
    How can people not be furious!
    Beiping students, full of anger,
    Decided to hold a large demonstration.
    The Chiang family government was alarmed,
    Ordering the school principals to suppress the students;
    The students ignored all this,
    Stopping classes on the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month.
    More than thirty thousand people lined up,
    Their shouts shook Beiping City.
    Listen, folks, listen,
    How fierce the slogans they shouted:
    "American troops get out of China!"
    "The brutal soldiers who committed the crime must be severely punished!"
    Thirty thousand arms waving together,
    Four people abreast, like a gust of wind,
    Small leaflets, large slogans,
    Pasted on the gates of the American military headquarters.
    An American military jeep passed on the street,
    Immediately plastered into a colorful lantern.
    Telegrams sent to America,
    If American troops aren't withdrawn, it won't work!
    From Beiping to Tianjin,
    Shanghai, Hangzhou to Nanjing.
    University students, middle school students,
    Male students, female students,
    All rose up, protesting, demonstrating, marching, stopping classes.
    Surrounding the Tianjin Municipal Government,
    The New Year's banquet couldn't be held;
    Shanghai students put it well:
    "Resist American goods" must be implemented;
    Nanjing surrounded the American embassy,
    Written questions for Stuart.
    Old Chiang, seeing this, was frightened,
    Ordered that the newspapers not be allowed to publish it.
    Prohibiting demonstrations, not allowing protests,
    As if he welcomed rape.
    Also sending special agents and student dogs,
    Saying that the girl was not decent.
    University professors were also angry,
    Advocating expelling the student dogs.
    From New Year's Day in 1947,
    The student movement is in full swing.
    The students are always the vanguard,
    Following closely behind are all classes,
    Responding enthusiastically,
    All together to drive out the American soldiers.
    Opposing Old Chiang selling out the country,
    He won't be able to sit on the throne of dictatorship.
    He won't be able to sit on the throne of dictatorship.

    蒋区学生大罢课
    金钢声
    老乡们,快快传：
    美国鬼子兵欺侮咱；
    各地学生起来了，
    罢课游行闹翻天。
    圣诞节，前一天，
    两个美军撒了欢，
    等在电影院门口，
    一心要把中国女人玩。
    姓沈的，女学生，
    独自离开电影院，
    两个野兽赶上去，
    一左一右把她拦，
    拉到操场树林里，
    轮流替换来强奸。
    有人见到不敢管，
    报告警察也不动弹，
    美国宪兵请来到，
    一个抓到一个窜。
    可怜那十七岁的沈姓女，
    昏迷不醒泪涟涟，
    若问他住啥学校？
    北京大学先修班；
    事情出在哪一地？
    北平城里靠近东单。
    这些美兵哪里来？
    老蒋磕头把他搬。
    老乡们，想想看：
    怎不叫人怒冲天！
    怎不叫人怒冲天！
    北平学生怒冲冲，
    决定示威大游行。
    蒋家政府心惊怕，
    命令校长压学生；
    学生不管这一套，
    腊月三十把课停。
    三万多人排大队，
    吼声震动北平城。
    叫老乡，你听听，
    口号喊得多么凶：
    “美军滚出中国去！”
    “行凶的兽兵要严惩！”
    三万条臂膀一齐挥，
    四人一排一阵风，
    小传单，大标语，
    贴到美军总部大门中。
    一辆美军吉普街上过，
    马上贴成个花纸灯。
    电报打到美国去，
    不撤美兵那不中！
    从北平、到天津，
    上海、杭州到南京。
    大学生，中学生，
    男学生，女学生，
    一齐起来、抗议、示威、游行把课停。
    包围天津市政府，
    过年的宴席摆不成；
    上海学生提得好：
    “抵制美货”要实行；
    南京包围美使馆，
    书面质问斯徒雷登。
    老蒋一见心害怕，
    下令不准把报登。
    禁止游行不准闹，
    好像强奸他很欢迎。
    又派特务学生狗，
    说那女生不正经。
    大学教授也怒恼，
    主张开除狗学生。
    一九四七元旦起，
    学生运动热烘烘。
    先锋总是学生打，
    跟后起来各阶层，
    轰轰烈烈来响应，
    一齐要赶走美国兵。
    反对老蒋把国卖，
    独裁的天下他坐不成。
    独裁的天下他坐不成。
