　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: London dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Deputies Meeting opened on the 14th. The first meeting was held in secret, lasting two and a half hours. British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech. Bevin did not mention the actual policies implemented by Britain in Germany and their ill consequences, but spoke generally of "preventing Germany from becoming a threat to peace again." The second meeting of the Foreign Ministers will discuss the procedures for the German peace treaty. Subsequent meetings will be chaired in turn by representatives from Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France. Poland, Yugoslavia, Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, South Africa, and Austria have submitted memoranda to the meeting. The entire work of the meeting is estimated to be completed within a month. The main task is to discuss the procedures for the peace treaties with Germany and Austria, to make recommendations for the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in Moscow in March.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: United Press reported: When the French National Assembly opened on the 14th, Communist Deputy Gasan served as chairman. In his address, Gasan issued a warning on the German issue. Gasan stated that the spirit of Hitler still permeates the British and American occupied zones of Germany. Eighteen months after the end of the war, three-quarters of German industry continues to operate, and its chemical and metal industries are also preparing to start. Under these circumstances, Britain and the United States have announced the economic unification of their occupied zones in Germany, and it is heard that Germany will receive significant loans to revitalize its economic power. All these measures will inevitably repeat the mistakes of 1919.

　　讨论对德奥缔结和约程序
    四外长代表会议开幕
    法共议员加善指责英美扶植德工业
    【新华社延安十六日电】伦敦讯：外长代表会议已于十四日开幕，首次会议秘密举行，历时二小时半，英外相贝文发表演说，贝氏未谈及英国在德所施行的实际政策，及其恶果，而泛论“防止德国再成为和平威胁”。外长代表第二次会议，将讨论对德和约的程序问题，往后的会议将由英、苏、美、法的代表轮任主席，波、南、加、奥、荷、南、非、奥地利诸国，已向该会提出备忘录，该会之全部工作估计可于一个月内完成。主要任务为讨论对德奥和约程序，以建议于三月间在莫斯科举行的四外长会议。
    【新华社延安十六日电】合众社报导：法国国民议会于十四日开幕时，由共产党议员加善任主席，加善在致词中关于德国问题提出警告，加氏声称：希特勒的精神，现仍弥漫于德国英美占领区。德国在大战结束十八个月后，其四分之三的工业仍继续开工，其化学与金属工业亦准备开工。在此种情况下，英美竟宣布其在德国占领区之经济统一，且闻悉德国将获得重要之贷款，以重振其经济力量。所有这些举措，必将重蹈一九一九年错误之覆辙。
