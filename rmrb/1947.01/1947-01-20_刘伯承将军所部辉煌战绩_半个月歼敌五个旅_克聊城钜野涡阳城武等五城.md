　　【Report from the Jilu豫 Front, this paper, 18th】 General Liu Bocheng's Field Headquarters has recently announced the victorious counter-offensive situation of the past half month, stating: From New Year's Day to the 16th, our army has recovered five county towns including Liaocheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Guoyang, and Chengwu, annihilating 25,000 invading Chiang troops; including 5,000 killed and wounded, and 20,000 captured, totaling five brigades; of which three and a half brigades were Chiang Kai-shek's regular army, and one and a half brigades were Zhang Lanfeng's puppet troops. This stage of the battle, with the recovery of the three cities of Liaocheng, Juye, and Jiaxiang and the counter-attack battle in the outer Jinxiang area on New Year's Day, was its prelude. The Chiang troops were terrified and hastily pieced together ten regiments from Xuzhou, Shangqiu, Heze, and other places, advancing in three routes from the south and west. The southern route was led by Fang Xianjue, and attached with the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division newly transferred from Taiwan. The western route was commanded by Liu Ruzhen, divided into two routes to attack east, one route departing from Heze, led by Mi Wenhe; the other route departing from Dingtao, led by the puppet army of Zhang Lanfeng. Our army first gave the southern route of Fang Xianjue a head-on blow, annihilating 9,000 Chiang troops north of Yutai from the 8th to the 9th, capturing the 140th Brigade Commander Xie Maoquan alive. Fang Xianjue fled in panic back to Yutai. Our army immediately moved westward, annihilating 3,000 puppet troops of Zhang Lanfeng from the 12th to the 14th, and then annihilating 6,000 troops of Liu Ruzhen's unit in the outer Dingtao area from the 15th to the 16th; Liu Ruzhen and Mi Wenhe fled back to Heze alone. On the evening of the 16th, our army took advantage of the victory to recover Chengwu County in two hours of battle, annihilating 1,000 Chiang troops. In total, in each battle, except for the 190th Regiment of the 15th Division east of Dingtao and the 6th Battalion of the 3rd Detachment of Zhang Lanfeng in Jiaxiang, which escaped, the rest were annihilated, and the puppet county governments, security teams, and "return home" teams of seven counties including Juye, Jiaxiang, Wenshang, Shouzhang, Yanggu, Yuncheng, and Chengwu were eliminated. Our troops in the Longhai Railway South Yu-Wan-Su area also recovered Guoyang on the 7th, and annihilated over 1,000 Chiang troops near Xuefeng (Yongcheng) on the 14th; the victories in the north and south echoed each other. Countless trophies were seized in each battle and are currently being inventoried. The unit designations of the annihilated Chiang troops are hereby announced as follows: (1) The entire 5th Regiment and one battalion of the 6th Regiment of the Juye puppet Zhang Lanfeng 3rd Detachment. (2) Two battalions of the 63rd Regiment of the 21st Brigade of the 88th Division and a part of the 61st Regiment in Jinxiang. (3) The entire 186th Regiment, most of the 184th Regiment of the 62nd Brigade, the directly subordinate units of the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division, and the entire 29th Regiment, and a part of the 28th Regiment north of Yutai. The 140th Brigade was newly transferred from Taiwan and was annihilated only one week after its arrival. (4) The entire 1st Detachment (two regiments) of Zhang Lanfeng east of Dingtao. (5) The entire 543rd Regiment of the 181st Brigade, the entire 243rd Regiment of the 81st Brigade, and the 220th Regiment (missing one battalion) of the 74th Brigade outside Dingtao. (6) One transport battalion of Zhang Lanfeng and the Chengwu puppet security regiment in Chengwu. (7) Most of the 30th Regiment and a part of the 29th Regiment of the New 10th Brigade of the 58th Division in Xuefeng City (Yongcheng).
