[Report from our newspaper in Weixian, dated the 11th] The felt hat industry in the Encha area of Zaoqiang is prospering as never before, thanks to the help of the democratic government and land reform. In the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], there were eight felt hat workshops, large and small, in Encha Village, and workshops in dozens of nearby villages. The hats produced were mainly transported and sold to Yantai, Weixian, Tianjin, and other places. Later, due to the Kuomintang government's pro-foreign policy and the monopoly of large landlords, the local hat industry was squeezed out by foreign hats and had to fall into poverty. After Japan's surrender, the industry gradually recovered. Last year, after the great emancipation movement, the government issued two loans totaling two million yuan and widely absorbed private capital, resulting in unprecedented development of the hat industry. Currently, among the 22 villages near Encha, there are 77 workshops, with mass shareholding accounting for about two-thirds, and small family-run workshops accounting for about one-third. In the past, hat workers and workshops squeezed and competed with each other. When the market was good, workshops competed for workers, raising wages; when the market was low, they reduced wages or laid off workers. "When the leaves turn yellow, the hat maker is like Wu Dalang, with nothing to eat or wear." This was a popular rhyme in that area. After the hat industry recovered last spring, labor unions and chambers of commerce were organized. More than 500 workers were organized, stipulating 30 jin of rice for two *pai* of work, and workers and capitalists shared the profits at a ratio of 20% to 80% (20% for workers, 80% for capitalists). Guo Zhenming, a worker in Encha, made more than 100 *pai* of work and earned more than 1,500 jin of rice, adding four *mu* of good land. He said, "I've been making hats since I was seventeen, for fifty or sixty years, and this is the first time I've been able to stand tall. My whole family bought eight bolts of cloth this year and put on new clothes. If it weren't for the Communist Party, we craftsmen would have starved to death long ago. How could we have today!" Guo Hongde was so poor in the past few years that he even sold his cotton quilt. This year, he not only earned 1,400 or 1,500 jin of rice but also added three *mu* of land. In Yanghuangwa, with more than 160 households, there are 30 workshops of all sizes, and two-thirds of the masses can make hats. Huang Jixiang and his son opened a workshop and earned 200,000 yuan. Hu Dianheng also earned more than 100,000 yuan by opening his own workshop. In the past year, the Encha area produced 250,000 hats, exchanging for 50% of the foreign exchange from Tianjin, Beiping, and Weixian, and 50% of necessities such as fur and alum. Due to the fair wage rate and profit-sharing system, workers' enthusiasm for production is extremely high, and labor and capital are working together to develop production, achieving mutual benefit. The Yishunxing workshop in Yanghuangwa produced 18,800 hat bodies throughout the year and received a dividend of 1.3 million yuan. The workers received 29,000 jin of rice in wages, greatly improving their lives. Now, near Encha, whether workers or bosses, every family is happy, everyone is cheerful, and everywhere you can hear words of gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　经翻身运动与政府扶助
    恩察一带毡帽业繁荣
  　年产毡帽二十五万顶换回大量必需品
    【本报威县十一日电】经过民主政府帮助及土地改革，枣强恩察一带的毡帽业，空前繁荣。民国二十年，恩察村有毡帽大小作坊八家，附近几十个村都有作坊，所产帽货均大宗运销烟台、潍县及平津等地。后因国民党政府媚外的错误政策，及大地主的垄断，当地帽业受外国帽货排挤，不得不走入穷困的境域。日本投降后，该业渐渐恢复。去年经过大翻身运动，政府又两次发放二百万元贷款，同时广泛吸收了私人资本，使帽业得到空前发展。现恩察附近二十二村中，已有七十七家作坊，群众集股者约占三分之二，全家劳动的小作坊约占三分之一。过去帽业工人和作坊都是互相排挤竞争。行市好了，作坊争用工人，则工资提高；行市低落，则减低工资或解雇工人。“树叶一黄帽子匠如武大郎，一没吃喝，二没衣裳。”这是那一带流行的歌谣。去春帽业恢复后，组织了工会和商会，五百多工人有了组织，规定两牌活三十斤米，工人与资方二八分红（工人二成，资方八成）。恩察工人郭振明作了一百多牌活，得一千五百多斤米，添了四亩好地。他说：“从十七岁作帽子，活了五六十年，这才是第一次挺起胸来。全家今年买了八个布，都穿上新衣裳。没有共产党，咱手艺人早就饿死了，那有今天！”郭洪得前几年穷得连棉被都卖了，今年不但挣了一千四五百斤米，还添了三亩地。一百六十多户人家的杨黄洼，有大小三十家作坊，三分之二的群众都会做帽子。黄继祥父子两人开作坊，赚了二十万元。扈殿亨自家开作坊，也赚了十几万元。一年来，恩察一带产帽二十五万顶，换回天津、北平、潍县外汇百分之五十，及皮毛黑矾等必需品，百分之五十。由于规定了公道的工资额及分红制度，工人生产情绪极为高涨，劳资同心发展生产，达到了劳资两利。杨黄洼义顺兴一家作坊，全年共产帽头一万八千八百顶，得红利一百三十万元，工人得工资米二万九千斤，生活大为改善。现恩察附近，不管工人东家，都是家家喜欢，人人愉快，处处可以听到感谢共产党、毛主席的话。
