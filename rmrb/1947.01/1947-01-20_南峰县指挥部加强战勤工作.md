　　[This newspaper, Jilu Yu, 18th Dispatch] To lighten the burden on the people and ensure supplies to the front lines, the Nanfeng County Headquarters has strengthened war support work, improved command structures at all levels, and shifted the work from passive to active. It has organized work teams to go to the countryside to conduct detailed surveys and registrations of laborers, livestock, militia, firearms, and grain, to avoid unfair distribution of burdens when requisitioning services. In addition, it has reorganized stretcher teams and village responsibilities. Generally, villages can organize laborers into groups, so they can take turns carrying stretchers. The elderly are also organized to carry out rear area work.

　　南峰县指挥部加强战勤工作
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】南峰县指挥部为减轻人民负担，保证前线供给，健全各级指挥部，使战勤工作由被动变为主动，特组织工作队下乡对壮丁、牲口、民兵、枪支、粮食进行详细调查登记，以免支差时负担不公。另外整理担架队与村负担，一般村可将壮丁编为数组，出担架时可以轮流，老年人亦加以组织，进行后方工作。
