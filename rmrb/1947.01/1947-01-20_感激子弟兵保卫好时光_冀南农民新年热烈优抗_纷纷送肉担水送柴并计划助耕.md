Jinnan farmers who have been emancipated are grateful to the soldiers for protecting their emancipated lives and are enthusiastically supporting the families of soldiers to celebrate the New Year, and are planning to help with spring plowing. A support-the-army meeting was held in Nanye Village, Hengshui. Wang Lansuo said, "I will give half a pig to comfort the families of soldiers." Wang Dabao and Zhang Jindong, who sell sesame oil, said, "Military families can buy our sesame oil at the price of sesame seeds." Wang Furu and two others who sell *gao* said, "Others exchange one catty and six taels of wheat for one catty of *gao*, but military families can exchange one catty and two taels." Carpenters Jia Bingjin and blacksmith Li Yunqing, and four others said, "We won't charge military families for repairing furniture." Li Qingyuan and Ma Sanxi said, "The soldiers at the front are fighting Lao Jiang to protect our rice bowls. The military families can call us anytime they need help, and we will be there." There are 34 families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in Kangzhuang, Qinghe. Usually, the support-the-army team helps the military families with work, the women's team does needlework for the military families, and the children collect firewood and carry water for the military families without labor. Recently, the farmers in the village donated 70,000 yuan to buy 157 catties of beef, 230 catties of steamed buns, and 1,000 catties of cabbage, which were distributed to each military family. The mother of Zhang Guodong, an old military family member in Cheying Street, Linqing City, is blind and seriously ill. The elementary school in the street sent her two *dou* of rice, two hundred catties of firewood, and one catty of noodles, and also invited a doctor to cure her illness. She touched the elementary school students and said, "With you, I won't have any difficulties." Handan Middle School organized a support-the-army activity to solve the difficulties of military families during the New Year, carrying water, collecting firewood, and sewing clothes for military families. An old military family woman said, "Don't make clothes for me, my daughter is coming soon." The female student said, "Your son has gone to fight Lao Jiang, the male students are like your sons, and we are your daughters." The old lady was so happy that she couldn't close her mouth. In Magang Village, Pingxiang, in order to show the glory of military families during the New Year and express their respect, the farmers made twenty-two large painted plaques with the words "National Hero" written on them and hung them on the doors of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Cadres in Xuguzhai Village, Weixian, received many woodcut paintings from their superiors and are now rushing to make "glorious lanterns" for military families. All agencies in the Fourth Military Sub-district, and public and private factories and shops in Nangong, unanimously agreed to donate half of their New Year's expenses to comfort the army. Zhenlonghao, Juji Machine Oil Factory, Lishenghao, Ruihua Bank, Yufenghao and 33 other companies donated a total of 500,000 yuan, which was distributed to the wounded and sick soldiers in the sub-district, the guard company, and the wounded and sick soldiers in the military region. Dongzhangzhai and Yaoshan Primary Schools in Feixiang donated 6,300 yuan and wrote letters to comfort the front lines: "We have food and clothing in the rear and can study hard and have a good New Year, all thanks to you. We don't know what to say to express our gratitude to you." The entire cadre of Julu said in a letter to the front lines: "In the past year, we have eliminated 45 brigades of the Chiang army. The people's army has been mechanized. The cadres and masses, encouraged by the victory, have donated 1.28 million yuan, which has been distributed to the families of soldiers in various villages and to the front lines. We are now carrying out the movement to investigate and reduce rents, and we guarantee to completely solve the land and housing problems of your families, as well as all the difficulties in spring plowing. Please rest assured and annihilate the enemy."
