　　[This newspaper's report from the Jiluyu area on the 20th] After Qi Gang Village in Nanwang Sixth District launched the "Land to Return Home" movement, more than 700 people were allocated 800 mu of land. During a mass meeting, villagers poured out their grievances, recounting the suffering and oppression endured by the poor. Yang Zhenxuan from Xitou, who sold tofu, suffered hardship his entire life without accumulating anything. When he worked for the landlord Qi Jingchen, his hand was crushed when the gate was closed, and he caught a cold. The landlord didn't even provide treatment; he didn't even have money to see to the wound. Aunt Yang cried as she spoke, and many people in the audience sighed along with her. In previous years, when landlord Qi Jingchen inspected the crops, the words he used to scold the poor were unspeakable. Whenever something was missing from his house, he would "turn over" the poor. What kind of logic is that! The masses were outraged. Later, everyone realized that the landlord's fortune was the poor's crime, the landlord's possessions were the poor's blood and sweat, and the landlord's land was obtained by exploiting the poor. Now that the poor want to turn the tables, they should take back the land and call their own land home for the New Year. Representatives were elected on the spot to establish a Land Reform Committee, and the masses put forward the slogan "Everyone has land to cultivate, every family has food to eat." Priority was given to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, each receiving a supplement of three mu of land. Poor peasants with less than three mu were supplemented to two mu and one fen. All 140 poor peasant households in the village, totaling 772 people, received land. Not only was the morale of the masses high, but the prestige of the cadres was also greatly enhanced. After the land issue was resolved in the village, it influenced the masses in the western half of the district to compete to pour out their grievances, wanting their own land to return home for the New Year.

　　南旺六区争取土地回家过年
    一村胜利引动全区
    【本报冀鲁豫廿日电】南旺六区齐岗庄，开展土地回家运动后，七百多人分到土地八百亩。在群众大会上，该村群众纷纷诉苦，倾诉穷人所受的痛苦与压迫。西头杨振宣卖豆腐，一辈子受尽苦楚，没落下一点东西，他给地主齐景臣家扛活时，关大门把手挤破受风，地主也不给治，连看疮的钱也没有。说到这里，杨大娘哭了，会场上好多人跟着叹气。地主齐景臣在往年看庄稼的时候，骂的穷人不是话，他家一没东西，都是“翻”穷人，这是啥道理！群众都愤怒起来。后来大家恍然大悟，知道了地主的福是穷人的罪，地主的东西是穷人的血汗，地主的地是剥夺穷人的。现在穷人要翻身，应该把地要回来，叫咱自己的地回家过年。当场推选代表成立土地改革委员会，群众提出“人人有地种，家家有饭吃”的口号。首先优待军烈属，每人补到三亩地，贫农三亩以下的都补到二亩一分。全村一百四十户贫农，七百七十二口人，都得到了土地，不但群众情绪高涨，干部威信也大大的提高了。该村的土地解决后，影响了西半区的群众争先恐后的诉苦，也要自己的土地回家过年。
