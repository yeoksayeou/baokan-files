Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st—As the Lunar New Year approaches, the prices of gold and US dollars have soared in major Kuomintang-controlled cities. According to reports from the Central News Agency in recent days, the price of gold in Shanghai rose by more than 50,000 yuan per tael in four days, from 370,000 yuan per tael on the 16th to 383,000 yuan per tael. On the 20th, it suddenly skyrocketed to 427,000 yuan. The Central Bank took the opportunity to "rush-sell" 997 gold bars that day (the actual number sold secretly was probably more). The price of US dollars also rose to 7,000 yuan. On the same day, the price of gold in Nanjing even rose to 464,000 yuan, and the price of US dollars to 7,000 yuan.

    【新华社延安二十一日电】旧历年关降临，蒋区各大城市黄金美钞突飞猛涨。据连日中央社讯：上海每两金价四天中上涨五万余元，即自十六日之每两三十七万逐渐上涨至每两三十八万三，到二十日忽然暴涨到四十二万七。中央银行是日即乘机“赶售”黄金九九七条（按暗售实数当不止此）。美钞亦涨达七千元。同日南京金价更涨到四十六万四，美钞七千。
