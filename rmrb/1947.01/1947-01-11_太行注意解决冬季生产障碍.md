　　Taihang Pays Attention to Solving Obstacles to Winter Production
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 9th] A comprehensive report from various localities: Taihang's winter production over the past month, combined with the overturning and inspection, supporting the front and participating in the war, and transporting grain, has resolved ideological problems and various work contradictions, and the movement has made considerable progress. In combination with investigation and rent reduction: After the people of Xiayu Village in Xiangyuan overturned, they had a sense of complacency, thinking that "we have enough to eat and wear, and we can get by this winter without production." The leadership proposed that "even if we sit and eat for three years, we still have to work. Even if it's cold this winter, we must engage in production." After clearing their minds, they raised more than 170,000 yuan in shares within three days and organized 120 laborers to participate in winter production. In resolving the middle peasants' fear of struggle and their lack of enthusiasm for production, Yuci implemented the policy of not infringing on the interests of the middle peasants, using the labor hero Shi Juhua as an example to carry out practical education, explaining that as long as one becomes wealthy through labor, one should not only not be struggled against but also rewarded. This effectively solved the ideological problems of the masses and promoted production. In combining investigation, rent reduction, and production, Licheng put forward the slogan "Thoroughly overturn and enter two doors," engaging in production on the one hand and investigation and rent reduction on the other. The production team and the bitterness-airing team were combined into one, brewing bitterness-airing during production and engaging in production during the intervals of bitterness-airing. They were both the backbone of the overturning and the core of production, achieving considerable results. Yuci implemented the practice of practicing martial arts in the morning, engaging in production during the day, and airing grievances and struggling at night. In combination with participating in the war, supporting the front, and transporting grain, Luhe Village in Lucheng assessed the strength of livestock and assigned scores. Voluntary groups were formed under the unified leadership of the cooperative, divided into long-distance transportation and short-distance transportation. Short-distance transportation was responsible for supporting the front, and the earned dividends were calculated and distributed uniformly. In Huangni Township, due to the implementation of the unified dividend method for production and support, the masses in Beijie also took out the carts that they had during the enemy's presence. The number of carts in the whole street increased from twenty-five to thirty-five. Jingtou Village in Lin County assessed the labor force of the whole village to assign labor, and unified labor tickets and work tickets were formulated. The two types could be used interchangeably, which improved the enthusiasm of the masses for production and supporting the front. Xiju Village divided the labor and livestock power of the whole village into three echelons, rotating production and rotating support, stabilizing the emotions of the masses. Finally, each echelon voluntarily combined into small cooperatives to help each other support the front and help each other produce, achieving considerable results. Heshan carried out production during the intervals of grain transportation, closely combining grain transportation and production. Thanks to the leadership's specific resolution of the two major difficulties in winter production, great achievements have been made in the past month. According to incomplete statistics from fifty villages, more than 29.67 million yuan has been earned.

　　太行注意解决冬季生产障碍
    【本报长治九日电】综合各地报导：太行月来的冬季生产结合着翻身大检查与支差参战运粮，解决了思想问题与各种工作矛盾的困难，运动得到长足发展。在与查减结合上：襄垣下峪村翻身后的群众有“够吃够穿今冬不生产也能过了”的自满思想，领导上提出“坐吃三年海要干，今冬虽冷必须搞生产”，打通了思想，三天内集股十七万余元，组织起劳力一百二十人，参加了冬季生产。在解决中农怕斗争，生产不积极的思想时，榆社贯彻不侵犯中农利益政策，以劳动英雄石菊花为例，作了现实教育，说明只要是靠劳动发了家，不斗争还要奖励，有力的解决了群众思想问题，推动起生产。在查减与生产结合上，黎城提出“翻透身双进门”的口号，一面查减一面生产，生产小组与诉苦小组结合为一，在生产中酝酿诉苦，在诉苦空隙中进行生产，它既是翻身骨干，也是生产核心，收到了不少成绩。榆社是实行了早上练武，白天生产，黑夜诉苦斗争。在与参战支差运粮结合上，潞城潞河村，把牲口强弱评定出了分数，自愿结合小组，由合作社统一领导，分长途运输与短期运输两种，短期运输负责支差，赚下红利统一算账分红。黄碾镇由于实行了生产支差统一分红办法，北街群众把敌人在时的大车也都拿出了，全街由二十五辆大车增至三十五辆。林县井头村是按全村劳力评差，统一制定差票工票，两种可以互相拨工，提高了群众生产支差情绪。西举村是把全村劳蓄力分为三个梯队，轮流生产，轮流支差，安定了群众情绪，最后各个梯队自愿结合成小型合作社，互助支差互助生产，收到了不少效果。和顺在运粮空隙中，进行了生产，使运粮生产做到密切结合。由于领导上具体解决了冬季生产中的两大困难，月来获得了巨大成绩，据五十个村不完统计共赚洋二千九百六十七万多元。
