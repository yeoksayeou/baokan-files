    We Capture Qingfeng, Shanxian, and Caoxian
    Local Counter-Offensives Begin Over the Past Two Months, Recovering Sixteen County Towns
    Continuous Large-Scale Annihilation of the Enemy Brings the Date of a Full-Scale Counter-Offensive Ever Closer
    Military Region Headquarters Issues Third Communiqué
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Military Region News: Following the recapture of thirteen county towns including Liaocheng and Juye, the Eighth Route Army on the Jilu Yu Front recovered Qingfeng County Town on the 25th. Simultaneously, on the 24th and 25th, the four gates of Shanxian and Caoxian were successively captured, and on the 26th, both cities were also liberated. It is reported that Caoxian is an important town in southwestern Shandong, only 30 kilometers away from the Longhai Railway, the lifeline of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. Shanxian is also no more than 40 kilometers away from the railway. Currently, Chiang's military transportation on the Longhai Railway has been severely threatened.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Headquarters of the Jinji Luyu Military Region recently issued its Third Communiqué stating: "For the past two months, the People's Liberation Army in our region has begun a local counter-offensive. In addition to continuing to annihilate a large number of Chiang's troops, it has also taken advantage of its victories to advance into the occupied areas and restore vast rural areas and towns. Up to now, sixteen county towns have been liberated (approaching one-half of the total number of county towns occupied by Chiang's troops since last July). These include: Juyeancheng recovered on November 20th (occupied on November 3rd), Jiyuan recovered on November 29th (occupied on November 3rd), Yuncheng recovered on December 3rd (occupied on October 24th), Liaocheng recovered on January 1st this year (occupied by puppet troops), Jiaxiang (occupied on October 18th last year), Juye (occupied on October 18th last year), Linzhang recovered on January 3rd (occupied on January 2nd), Fanxian recovered on January 11th (occupied on January 10th), Puxian recovered on January 11th (occupied on January 5th), Chengwue recovered on January 16th (occupied on September 6th last year), Guancheng recovered on January 19th (occupied on January 8th), Nanle recovered on January 23rd (occupied on January 14th), Dingtao recovered on January 24th (occupied on September 12th last year), Qingfeng recovered on January 25th (occupied on December 9th), Shanxian recovered on January 26th (occupied on September 3rd last year), and Caoxian recovered on January 26th (occupied on September 4th last year). The county towns that were recovered once are not included. With the belief that Chiang's troop strength will continue to be annihilated on a large scale, our army's full-scale counter-offensive is approaching, and by then all lost territories will return to the hands of the people."
    [Dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front of This Newspaper, 26th] The results of the Eighth Route Army's two-hour battle to recover Dingtao City on the 24th are as follows: The entire First Battalion of the 428th Regiment of the 143rd Brigade of Chiang's 68th Division, as well as the Dingtao Puppet County Government Security Regiment and puppet district offices, were annihilated. It is estimated that more than 200 people were killed or wounded, including the puppet Security Regiment Commander Shi Fuqi. Over 1,000 people were captured, including the 428th Regiment Deputy Commander Pang Shaoxu. The captured equipment included two mortars, two 60mm cannons, six heavy machine guns, thirty-two light machine guns, eight grenade launchers, two automatic rifles, six submachine guns, over 1,000 rifles, over 500 rounds of various shells, and over 100,000 rounds of ammunition.

    我克清丰单县曹县
    两月来开始局部反攻收复县城十六座
    继续大量歼敌全面反攻之期日益接近
    军区司令部发表第三号公报
    【本报特讯】军区消息：冀鲁豫前线八路军继克复聊城、巨野等十三座县城之后，又于二十五日收复清丰县城。同时，于二十四、二十五两日相继攻克单县、曹县两城之四关，二十六日两城亦告光复。按曹县为鲁西南重镇，距蒋介石内战动脉陇海路仅三十公里，单县距该路亦不过四十公里左右，现陇海路蒋军军运已感受严重威胁。
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区司令部顷发表第三号公报称：两个月以来，我区人民解放军开始局部反攻，除继续大量歼灭蒋军有生力量外，并乘胜向沦陷区进军，恢复广大乡村与城镇。迄目前为止，已有十六座县城重获解放（接近去年七月以后被蒋军侵占县城总数的二分之一）。计：去年十一月二十日收复鄄城（十一月三日被占），十一月二十九日收复济源（十一月三日被占），十二月三日收复郓城（十月二十四日被占），今年一月一日收复聊城（伪军盘踞）、嘉祥（去年十月十八日被占）、巨野（去年十月十八日被占），一月三日收复临漳（一月二日被占），一月十一日收复范县（一月十日被占）、濮县（一月五日被占），一月十六日收复城武（去年九月六日被占），一月十九日收复观城（一月八日被占），一月廿三日收复南乐（一月十四日被占），一月廿四日收复定陶（去年九月十二日被占），一月廿五日收复清丰（十二月九日被占），一月廿六日收复单县（去年九月三日被占）、曹县（去年九月四日被占）。一度收复之县城尚不包括在内。在相信蒋军有生力量继续大量被歼灭之情况下，我军之全面反攻已日益接近，届时一切失地均将重归人民手中。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十六日电】二十四日八路军以两小时战斗，收复定陶城之战果如下：蒋军六十八师一四三旅四二八团第一营及定陶伪县府保安团伪区署等全部被歼，计毙伤伪保安团长石福起以下二百余人，俘四二八团副团长庞绍绪以下一千余名，缴迫击炮两门，六公分小炮（六○炮）二门，重机枪六挺，轻机枪三十二挺，掷弹筒八个、自动步枪二支，手提式六支，步枪千余支，各种炮弹五百余发，子弹十余万发。  ）（附图片）
