Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 21st: The Chiang government has refused the National Federation of Commerce and Industry's request to prohibit the circulation and trading of U.S. dollars. According to a Central News Agency report, when asked about this on the 16th, Peng Xuepei stated that "the government will not change its foreign currency policy for the time being." The Nanjing National Federation of Commerce and Industry submitted a request to the Chiang government on the 9th of this month, demanding the prohibition of the circulation of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies. It also requested that U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies privately owned by foreigners and Chinese citizens should be exchanged for Chinese currency at banks to prevent them from continuing to be objects of speculation and contributing to rising prices in China. The public opinion circles in Nanjing and Shanghai have long pointed out that the circulation of U.S. dollars in the Chinese market undermines China's sovereignty and has become a factor in promoting malignant inflation and economic crisis in the KMT-controlled areas. Public opinion circles pointed out that the circulation of U.S. dollars in China was directly protected by the presence of U.S. troops in China and was also due to the Chiang government's traitorous and pro-foreign policy. Last year, the number of U.S. dollars circulating in China exceeded 100 million yuan. As U.S. land, sea, and air forces and other aggressive agencies came from and withdrew from China, the number of U.S. dollars withdrawn continued to increase. In addition to U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars are also circulating in the South China region.

    全国商联会要求禁止美钞流通
    蒋政府公然拒绝
    【新华社延安二十一日电】蒋政府已拒绝全国商联会，对禁止美钞流通及买卖之请求。据中央社电：彭学沛在十六日答复记者对此之提问时称：“政府对于外币政策暂不改变”。南京全国商联会系于本月九日向蒋政府提出禁止美钞及其他外币之流通，及买卖外国人及华人私有之美钞及其他外币应向银行换成中国货币，以免其继续成为投机对象，及促成中国物价上涨。京沪舆论界早即指出美钞在中国市场流通破坏了中国的主权，并成为促进蒋管区恶性通货膨胀及经济危机的一个因素，舆论界指出美钞所以取得在华流通，乃是在美军驻华的直接掩护下，同时由于蒋政府卖国媚外政策所致。去年间美钞在华流通数目已超过一万万元，由于美国海陆空军及其他侵略性机关来自中国，撤退美钞的数目还在继续增加，除美钞外，港币正在华南一带流通。
