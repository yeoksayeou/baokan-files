Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 25th: The Shandong Liberated Area Provincial Government held a financial and economic conference at the end of last year to summarize the province's achievements in production and thrift. According to incomplete statistics: production for self-sufficiency reached 33,698,600,000+ Legal Tender Yuan; including 11,010,600,000+ Yuan in Jiaodong; 2,324,000,000+ Yuan in Bohai; 5,390,200,000+ Yuan in Lucheng; 2,600,000,000+ Yuan in Lunan; 966,800,000+ Yuan in Binhai; 1,000,000,000+ Yuan in organizations directly under the Provincial Government; 4,223,600,000+ Yuan in organizations directly under the troops; and 6,183,000,000+ Yuan in the Field Army. Based on a population of 32 million in the Shandong Liberated Area, the average burden per person was reduced by 1,000 Legal Tender Yuan. The conference also determined that the province's production and self-sufficiency target for the first half of this year is 42,136,220,000+ Legal Tender Yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 25th: In order to overcome the financial and economic difficulties existing this year, reduce the burden on the people, and ensure military and civilian food supplies, the CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau has decided on the following measures: (1) Launch a large-scale mass production campaign this year. In order to closely integrate war and production, and to meet the needs of the masses after land reform, labor should be widely organized to greatly increase production, reduce unnecessary compulsory mobilization, and ensure that agricultural seasons are not missed. Promote production by military families and improve the work of preferential treatment to military dependents and resistance fighters. Manage rural loans to ensure that loans truly reach the poor masses and solve the difficulties of farm tools, seeds, and livestock after land reform. (2) Promote production by organs and troops. Based on specific conditions, carry out agricultural, industrial, and handicraft production, supplemented by commerce. Stores of organs and troops should reduce units and strengthen management to make them mass-based cooperatives. (3) Replenish and reorganize trade institutions and banks, consolidate local tax revenues, and strengthen material allocation. (4) Call for a mass thrift campaign. Leading organs and cadres at all levels should lead by example and serve as models for the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 25th: The organs and troops in Lucheng cherish the people's strength, practice thrift and production, and have achieved many successes. According to incomplete statistics: production for self-sufficiency by government organs accounts for 40% of total expenditures, and troops account for 30%. After simplifying the organization, the government and army have streamlined xxx people in total, reducing expenditures by 60%. Specific details of thrift and production are as follows: (1) Reduce clothing: For example, cadres at all levels in Yiyuan County voluntarily proposed the slogan of "supplementing cotton clothes by 20% to save winter clothes for the soldiers," and as a result, the winter clothes were successfully resolved. In other counties, winter clothing supplements did not exceed 30%. (2) Promote transportation: For example, the Second Military Sub-district used companies as units to extract a platoon for self-management and self-sufficiency, with a profit split of 30% for public and 70% for private, and soldiers could receive 500 Northern Currency Yuan per month. (3) Develop production: Most of the funds of military and government organs have been transferred to production undertakings, and oil mills, flour mills, and soap, iron, cigarette, and printing factories have been established. (4) Save the people's strength: All troops in the district are now doing it themselves; taking only the xxx unit of the Lucheng Military Region as an example, 12,000 people's strength was saved in two months. (5) Oppose corruption and waste: Economic and trade personnel generally conduct self-criticism and mutual appraisal, and instill the ideology of integrity and public service from practical education, and implement the reorganization of assets.
