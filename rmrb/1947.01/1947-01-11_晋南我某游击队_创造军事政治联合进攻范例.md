　　Our Guerrilla Force in Southern Shanxi
	Creates a Model of Joint Military-Political Offensive
	[This Dispatch from Taiyue, 5th] (Delayed) The ×× Guerrilla Force, persisting in the struggle behind enemy lines in Southern Shanxi against Chiang Kai-shek's troops, has created a model for guerrilla forces launching joint military-political offensives. When Hu Zongnan's troops moved west to attack Lüliang and east to aid Yuanqu, Wenxi, and Jiangxian, leaving the rear areas of these two counties empty, our ×× Guerrilla Force launched an offensive on December 11th along the Hengshui (an important town at the junction of Wenxi and Jiangxian counties) to Yangkou Dongzhen (on the Tongpu Railway) line. At the same time, political propaganda was carried out, recovering Hengshui Town and the Podi stronghold, liberating more than sixty villages south of the road, controlling forty li of waterway between Wenxi and Jiangxian, destroying eight large and small bunkers, cutting down more than forty li of electric wire, and capturing five enemy soldiers. Sixty-four young people who had been captured were liberated. Twelve mass meetings were held in fifteen villages, and cadre meetings were held in four villages. Two hundred and forty-eight slogans were written, investigations were conducted in four villages, and no less than five thousand people were subjected to propaganda and education. Before launching the offensive, the ×× Guerrilla Force solicited opinions from various local work departments and investigated the emptiness of Chiang Kai-shek's rear. It was jointly decided that, in addition to the troops, the local departments would form an armed work team to be responsible for propaganda work. After the offensive began, the team ostensibly requisitioned a large number of civilian laborers, carriers, and grain from the villages, creating an atmosphere of large-scale military action to further frighten Chiang Kai-shek's troops. On the 10th, military attacks were launched against the weak strongholds of Hengshui Town and Podi Village. At the same time, the armed work team dispersed and went deep into the villages to coordinate propaganda, hold meetings, and write slogans. The guerrilla force also cut off the electric wires near the two strongholds. Chiang Kai-shek's troops were terrified and attempted to flee. They then concentrated their forces and, in coordination with the masses' armed forces, advanced toward the two strongholds at 8:00 pm on the 11th with great momentum. As they approached the two strongholds, the Chiang's puppet troops fled in panic, and Hengshui Town and Podi Village were recovered by our forces. Demolishing the bunkers was carried out immediately, and mass meetings were held in various villages to conduct propaganda. Not only did the armed work team carry out propaganda, but the military personnel also did the same. For example, Comrade Peng Hanmin, the company commander of the Third Company, despite his fatigue, participated in writing slogans during his rest time after the battle. Comrade You Ming, a platoon leader of the Second Company, went to the school to teach singing. Many local rural intellectuals also automatically helped with propaganda. News from home and abroad, which had been blocked for four months, spread again in this dead land. The people excitedly said: "The world has changed, and our troops are back! The day of liberation has arrived!" Even the plainclothes agents of Chiang's puppet regime said after being captured: "The district chief told us to go to Podi to scout for information. As soon as we arrived, we heard the people say that the Eighth Route Army was coming soon. We thought the world was really going to change. There are fewer people from the central government, and more people from the Eighth Route Army." Some people even automatically said to the comrades of the troops: "Without high mountains, you don't know the plains. Without the central government coming, you don't know how good the Eighth Route Army is." Hearts that had been dead for four months were beating again.

　　晋南我某游击队
    创造军事政治联合进攻范例
    【本报太岳五日电】（迟到）坚持晋南蒋军后方斗争的××游击队，创造了游击队开展军事政治联合进攻的范例。当胡宗南军队西犯吕梁东援垣曲、闻喜、绛县两处空虚之际，我××游击队于十二月十一日向横水（闻喜绛县交界处之重镇）羊口东镇（同蒲线上）一线展开攻势。同时进行政治宣传，收复横水镇及坡底据点，解放路南六十余处村庄，控制闻喜、绛县间水路四十余里，摧毁大小碉堡八个，收割电线四十余里，俘敌五人。解放被抓青年六十四人。在十五个村召开了十二次群众大会和四个村的干部会议，写标语二百四十八条，进行了四个村的调查，受到宣传教育的群众不下五千余人。××游击队在发动攻势以前曾向地方工作各部门征求意见，并调查蒋军后方空虚情形，共同决定除部队外，地方各部门合组一武装工作队，负责宣传工作，攻势开始后即向各村佯索大批民夫担架及粮秣，造成将有大规模军事行动之空气，使蒋军更加恐慌。十日乃向蒋军薄弱据点横水镇、坡底村两处开始进行军事攻击，武装工作队同时分散深入各村配合宣传开会写标语，游击队并将该两据点附近之电线割断，蒋军恐慌万分，有逃跑模样便集中力量，配合群众武装于十一日下午八时向两据点推进，声势浩大，迫近两据点时，蒋伪仓惶而逃，横水镇坡底村遂被我收复，立即进行平毁碉堡，在各村召开群众大会，进行宣传，不但武装工作队作宣传，军事人员亦同样宣传，如三连连长彭汉民同志，在作战后休息时间，不顾疲劳参加写标语，二连排付有明同志到学校去教唱歌，当地许多农村知识分子也自动帮助宣传，被封锁了四个月的国内外消息，又在这块死了的土地上传播开去，老百姓兴奋地说：“世事变了，咱们队伍又下来了！出头日子到了！”连蒋伪的便衣被俘后也说：“区长叫咱到坡底去探消息，一到就听老百姓说八路快来，咱想世事真要变了，中央的人少了，八路的人多了。”有些人更自动的对部队同志说：“没有高山不知平川，中央不来不知八路好。”死了四个月的心，又在跳动了。
