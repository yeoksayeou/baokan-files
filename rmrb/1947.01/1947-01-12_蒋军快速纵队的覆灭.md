Xinhua News Agency, Lunan, 10th. A front-line reporter reported on the annihilation of Chiang's 26th Division and its attached Rapid Column, stating: The Lunan People's Liberation Army launched a counter-offensive on the midnight of the day after New Year's Day against the strongholds of Shichengdian, Pingtunqian, and Fenghuangshan (all located southwest of Linyi) held by the 169th Brigade and the 44th Brigade of Chiang's 26th Division. That evening, they destroyed the fortified stronghold of Bianzhuang of the 169th Brigade, seized the high ground, and the fate of the 169th Brigade was sealed. At dawn on the 3rd, an attack was launched on the 44th Brigade's position. By 9:00 AM, the strongholds of Shichengdian and Pingshan held by the brigade were captured, and four battalions of Chiang's troops were annihilated. All the above important strongholds completely fell into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, and the invading army was even more powerless. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the above two brigades were completely wiped out. The "capture of Linyi for the New Year" repeatedly touted by Chiang's senior commanders vanished without a trace. The American-equipped Rapid Column (including the 80th Brigade of the 28th Division) attempted to cover the remnants of the 26th Division headquarters and other units and break through to the southwest. Consequently, on the Lin (yi) - Yi (xian) highway, the mournful sounds of tanks and trucks echoed. They used intense firepower to cover the retreat of their remaining defeated soldiers, but just as they reached Chenshuzhuang on the highway, they encountered a powerful encirclement by the New Fourth Army. Various artillery shells rained down like a storm, and the Chiang's soldiers who were hit immediately fled in panic. The People's Liberation Army soldiers bravely charged towards the Chiang's troops, quickly cutting them into three sections and encircling and annihilating them separately. At this time, more than 200 trucks and 30 tanks desperately raced back and forth on the vast slopes of Lanling. The heroic soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, relying on fierce artillery and rifles, attacked the tanks and trucks. The special forces on the Chiang's vehicles abandoned their vehicles one after another and fled for their lives. One of Chiang Kai-shek's only two rapid columns was thus annihilated. Many intact American trucks and tanks were turned around to arm the People's Liberation Army. On the evening of the 4th, in the deep twilight, more than 20,000 prisoners were escorted to the rear by militiamen like a tide. The faces of the people's soldiers guarding hundreds of trucks and tanks were filled with smiles of victory and excitement.

　　蒋军快速纵队的覆灭
    【新华社鲁南十日电】前线记者报导蒋军二十六师及所附快速纵队被歼经过情形称：鲁南人民解放军于元旦翌日午夜对蒋军二十六师一六九旅与四四旅部队踞守之石城店、平屯堑、凤凰山（均位于临沂西南）等据点，展开自卫反击。当晚即将一六九旅之强固据点卞庄摧毁，掌握了高地，一六九旅覆灭的命运就决定了。三日拂晓对四四旅驻地展开攻击，早上九点钟该旅踞守之石城店、平山等据点即被攻克，蒋军四个营被歼，以上诸重要据点，完全落入解放军之手，侵犯军就更无能为力。经过一昼夜激战，上面两个旅全部被歼。蒋军高级指挥官一再吹嘘的“攻下临沂过新年”，便消逝得无影无踪了。美械装备的快速纵队（包括二十八师之八十旅）以图掩护之二十六师师部等残余部队，向西南突围；于是临（沂）峄（县）公路上，便发出了坦克和卡车凄厉的摩托声，他们用强烈火力掩护其残兵溃退，但刚到公路上之陈殊庄附近，又遇到了新四军强大的大兵围集，各种炮弹像暴雨一样飞射，被击的蒋军士兵当即仓惶奔逃，人民解放军战士们勇猛的向蒋军冲击，飞快的把蒋军截成三段，分别围歼。这时二百多辆卡车和三十辆坦克车，绝望的在兰陵广阔的坡地上来回奔驶。解放军英勇战士凭借着猛烈的炮火步枪向坦克、卡车进攻，蒋军车上特种兵们纷纷丢弃车辆，各自奔跑逃生。蒋介石仅有的两个快速纵队，其中一个就这样被歼灭了。许多完好的美式卡车、坦克转而武装了人民解放军。四日晚间色暮深沉中，两万多俘虏像潮水般的被民兵们押送到后方。看管着数百辆卡车和坦克的人民战士的脸上，浮着胜利和兴奋的微笑。
