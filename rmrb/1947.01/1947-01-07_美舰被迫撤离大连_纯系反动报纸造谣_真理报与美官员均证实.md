Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: According to a report by a Pravda correspondent, the truth about the so-called "Dalian Incident" is as follows: The U.S. Embassy in Nanjing requested the Soviet Embassy to notify the Soviet authorities that a U.S. ship carrying a liaison officer, who was to have business discussions with the U.S. Consul General in Dalian, would arrive in Dalian on December 18th and stay there for 48 hours. The notification did not mention other passengers. When the ship arrived in Dalian on that day, the captain requested the Soviet side to allow two American journalists and representatives of Standard Oil to disembark. The Soviet side, because the previous notification had not mentioned these individuals, refused permission to land. After the U.S. ship stayed in Dalian for 48 hours, it notified the Soviet side that the captain's stay in the city was delayed and requested an extension of the departure date. The Soviet side granted the request. Then, a few hours later, when the captain returned to the ship, it left Dalian. The Pravda correspondent stated that one of the four journalists who were not allowed to land, named Canutt Newton, was a journalist for the Howard newspaper group. The allegation that the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to the U.S. ship is a malicious fabrication and slander, intended to achieve the purpose of anti-Soviet propaganda.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: According to a dispatch from the U.S. Information Office in Washington, U.S. officials have further investigated the so-called incident of the U.S. ship being forced to withdraw from Dalian and found discrepancies with the rumors. It is said that the Soviet side's order for the U.S. ship to withdraw within 20 minutes is not true. A U.S. official stated that this incident did not contain any unfriendly intentions.

    “美舰被迫撤离大连”
    纯系反动报纸造谣
    真理报与美官员均证实
    【新华社延安二日电】据真理报记者报导，所谓“大连事件”真相如下：南京美大使馆曾请求苏大使馆通知苏联有关当局，谓一载有与美国驻大连总领事有事务商谈的联络官之美舰将于十二月十八日抵大连，并在该地停留四十八小时。该通知未提及其他乘客，当该舰于该日抵大连时，舰长要求苏方允两美记者及美孚油公司代表登陆，苏方因前此之通知未提及此等人物，故不允登岸。该美舰在大连停留四十八小时后，又通知苏方谓该舰长在市内逗留延误，请求展期起航，苏方又允其所请，于是该舰于数小时后直至，长回舰时，即离开大连。真理报记者称：未被准许登陆的四名记者中之一位名可牛顿，为霍华德系报的记者，所谓苏联曾向美舰提出最后通牒，全系恶意造谣诽谤，图达其反苏宣传目的。
    【新华社延安一日电】据美国新闻处华盛顿电称：美官员已进一步调查关于所谓美舰被迫撤离大连一事，发现事实与外传有出入。据称苏方限令美舰于二十分钟内撤退一节殊非事实，美方某官员称：此次事件绝未含有不友好之意。
