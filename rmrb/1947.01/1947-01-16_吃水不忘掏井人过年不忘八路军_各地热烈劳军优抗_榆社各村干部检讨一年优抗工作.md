The liberated masses of Liangjiazhuang in Huolu County spontaneously supported the army, and within two hours, yams, tofu, vermicelli, cabbage, and soybeans piled up in a large field. In Lijiazhuang, Second District of Changzhi, liberated women scrambled to wash clothes and quilts for the wounded soldiers. When everyone heard that the Peace Hospital had sent a letter mobilizing women to wash clothes for the wounded soldiers, they rushed to the village office early in the morning and immediately distributed over 90 items of clothing and bedding. The late-arriving women kept complaining about themselves. To wash the clothes and bedding more cleanly, some women went to buy salt, and after washing, they dried them over a fire and sent them quickly.
    The Taihang Administrative Office Printing Factory and all its employees donated over 30,000 silver dollars and 17 books in half an hour.
    Also reported: Yushe and other places launched a campaign to give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers resisting Japan. Liberated farmers spontaneously gathered firewood, invited them to meals, and donated money to comfort the families of soldiers resisting Japan, retired soldiers, and the families of martyrs. The cadres of various villages made profound reviews of the preferential treatment work over the years and actively solved various difficulties for the families of soldiers. Shi Jiuhai, a family member of a soldier, said emotionally: "I will write a letter to my child and tell him to fight the enemy with peace of mind."
