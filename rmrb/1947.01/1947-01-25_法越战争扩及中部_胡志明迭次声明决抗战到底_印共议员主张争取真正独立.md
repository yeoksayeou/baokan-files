　　Franco-Vietnamese War Spreads to Central Vietnam
    Ho Chi Minh Repeatedly Declares Determination to Fight to the End
    Indian Communist Party Legislators Advocate for Genuine Independence
    [Comprehensive Report] According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 19th to the 23rd: Vietnam and India are striving for independence, each with its specific circumstances and forms of struggle. In Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh has issued three appeals: The first was a broadcast on the evening of the 14th, expressing gratitude to Asian countries and people around the world for their sympathy for Vietnam's struggle for independence, and declaring that the Vietnamese people are determined to fight to the end. The second was a statement on the 18th, reiterating that Vietnam will fight hard until it achieves genuine independence, calling on the people of Asia to unite as one, and pointing out that if the French reactionaries continue to act recklessly, they will become increasingly isolated, and Algeria will also revolt against French colonial policy. The third was in a telegram to Auriol congratulating him on his election as President of France, suggesting immediate peaceful negotiations to avoid unnecessary sacrifices for the people of France and Vietnam. However, the French reactionaries, taking advantage of the fact that the new coalition government in France has not yet been formed, are stepping up their war of aggression. The second batch of reinforcements has already departed from Marseille. French Communist leader Gaussein has criticized this. Currently, the Franco-Vietnamese War has expanded to central Vietnam.
    In India, when the Constituent Assembly opened in New Delhi on December 9th last year, the sole Indian Communist Party legislator proposed an amendment to Nehru's motion on "the purpose and objectives of the Constituent Assembly." The main points were to declare India an independent country and demand international recognition, the interim government should complete the task of withdrawing British troops from India, establish Indian army, navy, and air force, nationalize wasteland, give cultivated land to farmers, reduce rent and interest rates, stipulate minimum wages, punish exploitative capitalists, and take over and nationalize British-run factories. On the 15th of this month, teachers in New Delhi launched a strike after their demands for government pay raises were not met. Three hundred and fifty schools have been closed, and students are assisting teachers. The situation is spreading.

　　法越战争扩及中部
    胡志明迭次声明决抗战到底
    印共议员主张争取真正独立
    【本报综合报导】据新华社十九日至二十三日电讯：越南与印度的争取独立，各有其具体情况与斗争形式。在越南，胡志明主席先后发表了三次呼吁：一次是十四日晚的广播，向亚洲诸国及世界人士对越南独立斗争之同情表示谢意，并声明越人决抗战到底。第二次是十八日的声明，重申越南将艰苦奋斗，直到获得真正独立为止，号召亚洲各民族团结一致，并指出法国反动派如果蛮干到底，将日益孤立，亚尔及利亚亦将起义反对法殖民地政策。第三次是在致贺奥勒尔当选法总统的电文中，建议立即和平谈判，以免法越两国人民的无谓牺牲。然而法国反动派，趁法国新的联合政府未组成的时候，加紧进行侵略战争，第二批援军已由马赛起程，法共领袖之一加善曾予以抨斥。目前法越战争已扩展至越南中部。
    印度方面，当去年十二月九日制宪议会在新德里开幕时，唯一的印共议员提出对尼赫鲁所提“制宪议会的宗旨与目标”一案的修正案，其要点为宣布印度为独立国并要求国际承认，临时政府应完成使英军撤离印度的任务，成立印度海陆空军，荒地国有，耕地农有，减租减息，规定最低工资，处罚暴敛资本家，接收并国营英办工厂。本月十五日新德里教员的要求政府加薪未遂发动了罢课，已有三百五十所学校停课，学生援助教师，事态正蔓延中。
