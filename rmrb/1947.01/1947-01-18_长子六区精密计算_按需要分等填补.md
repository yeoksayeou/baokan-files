(Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 16th) The Sixth District of Changzi rationally distributed the fruits of struggle according to needs, which satisfied the broad masses of peasants and rapidly realized "land to the tiller." The methods can be summarized as follows: First, allocation was determined based on three grades and nine levels, or five grades and fifteen levels, considering the individual's situation of emancipation. Those with hemp fields received less hemp land, and those with autumn fields received less autumn land. Second, allocation was determined based on individual needs and emancipation status, and all fruits were converted into millet for distribution. If the distributed goods exceeded the original quota, it would be addressed later. Third, allocation was also determined by quota. For example, in Guo Village, the lowest was one share, and the highest was eleven shares. However, the distribution of goods was limited by the determined quota. After all the fruits were distributed, if someone received more than their original quota, adjustments could be made based on the situation to meet individual needs. This method was widely implemented in both districts. Fourth, grades were still assigned, but quotas were not determined. All the fruits of struggle were meticulously counted, and people received what they needed. This method yielded good results in Wangnei West and Wangjiapo. However, without careful inspection and calculation, it could lead to unfairness. The method of distributing fruits this time had to go through repeated democratic discussions before distribution. For example, the distribution of fruits in Guo Village took a month. Although it was not economically efficient in terms of time, it truly followed the mass line. The process was as follows: First, the evaluation team and valuation team made preliminary divisions, conversions, and markings. Second, the heads of the agricultural association groups participated in the inspection and revised the evaluation. Third, members of the agricultural association took turns participating in the evaluation meeting and revised it again. Fourth, a general meeting was held for discussion, and the final revisions were publicly decided upon. Fifth, the distribution was implemented. The masses were satisfied with the results of this distribution. In the process of this distribution, the main objectives were first determined, such as land, houses, and grain, to fill the major gaps. The remaining scattered items were addressed through minor supplements and universal distribution, all of which were broken up. The distribution had to consider the specific village and the degree of awareness of the masses. In backward villages, it was still necessary to take care of individual problems to avoid affecting the enthusiasm of the masses, but without much disparity. In villages with a high degree of mass awareness, individuals should be encouraged to emancipate themselves and help others to do so, striving for reasonable and even distribution of fruits. After this distribution of fruits, the relationship between cadres and the masses in general villages became closer, establishing the style of cadres serving the masses. The chairman of the Xiaoguo Village Agricultural Association visited relatives with tattered clothes. Someone told him to take a piece of clothing from the fruits of struggle, but he said, "Let the masses emancipate themselves first, and we will emancipate ourselves later." After the masses of Wangguo Village were emancipated, they elected representatives to check whether the cadres had been thoroughly emancipated. Their slogan was "Cadres must emancipate themselves together with us."

　　长子六区精密计算
    按需要分等填补
    【本报太岳十六日电】长子六区按照需要合理分配斗争果实，得到广大农民满意，迅速实现耕者有其田。其方法概括起来有以下四种：一、按三等九级或五等十五级与个人翻身情况定份分配，如有麻地者少分麻地，有秋地者少分秋地。二、是按个人需要与翻身情况定份，并将所有果实折合为小米进行分配，若分配东西超过原定分数者，以后再说。三、亦定份分配，如郭村最低为一分，最高为十一分，但分配东西时又受定分数的限制，将所有的果实一齐分完后，如有人所分东西超过原定份数，可按情况重新修改，使服从个人需要。此种方法在两区普遍实行。四、仍划等级但不定份。将所有斗争果实精密统计，按需要什么分什么。在王内西，王家坡使用此种方法效果颇好。但如不经精密检查计算，却会产生不公平，此次分配果实的办法要经过反复的民主讨论，然后分配。如郭村分配果实，前后经过一个月的时间，虽在时间上不经济，但真正走了群众路线，其过程是第一次评议组折价组初步分折标计。第二次农会小组长参加检查，修改评议。第三次农会会员轮流参加评议会，再行修改。第四次大会讨论，最后修改公决评议。第五次实行分配。这样分配结果群众满意。在此种分配的过程中，首先决定大目标即土地、房屋、粮食等，填补大窟窿，余下的零星物件采取小补与普遍分配，均打乱，分配中须看具体村庄，群众的觉悟程度而决定，如落后村还需照顾个人问题，以免影响群众的积极性，但无多大悬殊。群众觉悟程度较高的村子，要鼓励个人翻身并帮助别人翻身，力求果实分配合理均匀。经过此次果实分配，一般村庄干部与群众关系更加亲密，树立干部为群众服务的作风。小郭村农会主席走亲戚，衣服很烂，有人叫他在斗争果实中缝上一件，他说：“让群众先翻身，咱们后翻身。”王郭村群众翻身后并选代表检查干部是否已翻透身，他们的口号是“干部要和我们一齐翻身。”
