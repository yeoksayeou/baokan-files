    Three Requests

    Editor's Note: This newspaper has now received many letters from readers providing valuable opinions. This newspaper will open a special column to publish them successively. We earnestly hope that readers from all walks of life will actively provide opinions!

            To the Editors of the People's Daily:

    We are very surprised that the People's Daily can be published under difficult printing conditions. At that time, there were two opinions here: (1) Simply looking at the surface form, the title fonts and typesetting are as lively as the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily. (2) From the perspective of content and clear printing, and from the perspective of combining with local work, it is done relatively well. This is especially well done recently. The categorized articles are quite complete. We hope that everyone can argue about whether the two opinions are correct or not.

    We think it is very good in terms of editing, typesetting, proofreading, and printing. We only have a few requests in terms of content: (1) When publishing new creations and inventions, the detailed methods should be explained. For example, the new delivery method of the International Peace Hospital and the wooden flour mill invented by Xu Bowen in Li Feng Village, Jiaozuo, published in your newspaper, are difficult to adopt because the methods are not introduced. Although this is because the correspondent did not explain it, we hope you can write to them and ask them clearly. (2) We think the many articles exposing the inside stories of the Kuomintang recently published in the newspaper, such as the Xi'an Incident, are very good. The story of the Youth Party also made me understand a lot of information. (3) There have been few introductions to the stories of the Soviet Union's vigorous production after defeating the German bandits in the past, and we hope there will be more in the future. Your newspaper has a large space, and we hope to introduce more on the days when you publish four pages.

    提出三点要求
    编者按：本报现已收到读者来函多封，对报纸提供了很宝贵的意见，本报将辟专栏，陆续发表，恳盼各界读者踊跃提供意见是幸！
            人民日报编辑同志：
    人民日报能在困难的印刷条件下出版，我们感觉到很惊异。当时我们这里有两种说法：（一）单纯从表面形式看，认为标题字、排版。如晋察冀日报活泼。（二）从内容和印刷清楚上看，从与地方工作结合上看，都做的比较好。这点特别在最近做的好，分门别类的文章，相当齐全，两种看法正确与否，希望能引起大家的争论。
    在编、排、校、印各方面我们觉得很好，只在内容方面提出几点要求：（一）对新的创造和发明发表时，要说明详细办法，例如贵报登载过的国际和平医院的新接产方法及焦作李封村许伯温发明的木制磨面机，因为没有介绍办法，就很难采用，虽然这是通讯员没说明的关系，但希望你们能写信给他们，问明白。（二）最近报上发表的许多揭露国民党内幕的稿子，如西安事变经过，我们觉得很好，还有青年党的故事也使我了解了很多情况。（三）苏联打败德寇后的猛力生产故事，过去介绍得少，今后望能多些。贵报篇幅较大希望在出四版的那天，多介绍些。
