[This report from the Jin-Lu-Yu Front, dated 14th] Amidst the victories in Jinxiang and Yutai, guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines is becoming increasingly active. We have recovered strongholds like Huxindian in Chengwu, and extensively disrupted the Chiang army's telecommunications and transportation. On the 8th, over 3,000 soldiers from the 24th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's Security Preservation Force attempted to invade Qinggujizhen (southwest of Chengwu) in the vicinity of Huxindian (southwest of Chengwu). Our local troops rose up in counterattack, captured Huxindian, killing, wounding, and capturing 100 enemy soldiers including company and platoon leaders. We seized 14 rifles and over 400 rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, the Chiang army's telecommunications and transportation between He(ze) Kao(cheng), He(ze) Ding(tao), Cao(xian) Kao(cheng), and Cao(xian) Ding(tao) were repeatedly disrupted by our local armed forces and militia more than ten times.
