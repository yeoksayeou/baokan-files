邯郸岗西小区
Six Days to Make 10,000 Stone Mines

[This newspaper reported]邯郸岗西小区 (Gangxi District, belongs to the Third District), is located east of the Pinghan Railway. After the leadership deployed the explosion campaign on the 11th of last month, the village cadres mobilized the masses to prepare the tools for making mines, calling on "every household, men, women, old and young, to make mines together." The masses in Nan Niu Jiao Village, having experienced the effectiveness of landmines in killing the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan, voluntarily set a plan to manufacture 500 stone mines as soon as the village cadres called on them. Because there were not enough mine-detonating rods, the next day, every family rummaged through boxes and cabinets to find scrap copper to make rods. In five days, 500 mines were rushed to completion. On the 17th, district cadres inspected villages and found that all villages were focusing their efforts on making mines. According to statistics, in six days, a total of 9,989 stone mines had been completed. Among them, a large village manufactured 900 mines.

[Another dispatch] The reason why the masses in Gangxi District have such a high enthusiasm for making mines is: (1) The ideology of the emancipated peasants has been well mobilized. When they heard that the Jiang bandits were actively launching an offensive on the Pinghan Railway again, they consciously entered a state of war. They said: "This is not for anything else, but to protect our emancipated property!" (2) Influenced by the mine-making campaign of the masses in the Taihang District. They said: "Hu Yu (belonging to Taihang) is not far from us, and they have already started working on it. Their women are also making them, shouldn't we hurry up and get to work!" (3) Everyone believes in the power of landmines, saying: "When the Japanese were here, there were Eighth Route Army soldiers on both sides of the communication trench, and Japanese blockhouses on this side. The enemy never dared to cross the trench because they were afraid of landmines."

    邯郸岗西小区
    六天造石雷万颗
    【本报讯】邯郸岗西小区；六天造石雷万枚。岗西小区（三区属），位于平汉路东侧。领导上于上月十一号布置爆炸运动后，各村干部即动员群众准备好造雷家具，号召“家家户户，男女老少齐造雷”。南牛叫村群众因抗战中就体验到地雷杀伤敌人的作用很大，故村干部一号召，就自动订出造制五百个石雷的计划。因打雷竿子不够，第二天每家都翻箱倒柜的将碎铜找出来做竿子。五天工夫，五百雷即赶造停当。到十七号，小区干部挨村检查，发现所有村庄无不集中火力造雷。经统计结果，六天时间，即已完成石雷九千九百八十九枚。其中大村有一村即造九百枚者。
    【又讯】岗西小区群众造雷情绪所以如此高涨，其原因：（一）翻身农民思想动员的好。当听说蒋贼又积极开始进攻平汉路后，都自觉地进入战争状态。他们说：“这不是为别的，要保住咱的翻身家当呀”！（二）受太行区群众造雷影响。他们说：“胡峪（太行属）离咱没多远，人家早干开了。人家娘们也造，咱们还不赶快搞”！（三）大家相信地雷威力说：“以前日本在时，交通沟两边是八路军，这边是鬼子炮楼，敌人始终不敢过沟，就因为鬼子怕地雷”。
