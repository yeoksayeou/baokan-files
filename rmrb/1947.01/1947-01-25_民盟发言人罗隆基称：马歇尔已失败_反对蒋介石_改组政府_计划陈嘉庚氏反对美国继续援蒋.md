Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st—An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 20th: Luo Longji, a spokesman for the China Democratic League, stated at a press conference: "The Marshall Mission has failed, and the U.S. government should be responsible for the erroneous policies of the United States. We oppose any plan by the Chiang government to "reorganize the government" by excluding the Communist Party, believing that this action will prolong the Chinese civil war." Luo expressed disagreement with the view currently held by some that the two preconditions put forward by the Chinese Communist Party for resuming peace talks (restoring the military positions of January 13th of last year and declaring the National Assembly invalid) are "impossible".

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd—According to a Reuters dispatch from Singapore on the 4th, overseas Chinese leader Chen Jiageng stated: "...If the United States continues to unilaterally aid the Kuomintang, the peace of the entire world will inevitably be threatened. I believe that if the U.S. government can change its policy towards China, then the fascist dictator of China will have no way to survive, and a democratic coalition government can be established." Chen also telegraphed Li Zongren, refuting Li's previous argument calling for the United States to continue providing financial aid to the Kuomintang. Chen stated: "The National Government's continued receipt of American support will inevitably cause China to become a vassal of the United States and make the descendants of the Chinese people slaves of the dollar empire. I believe that what China needs now is to stop American aid to the Kuomintang and immediately establish a democratic coalition government to replace the one-party government."

　　民盟发言人罗隆基称：马歇尔已失败
    反对蒋介石“改组政府”计划陈嘉庚氏反对美国继续援蒋
    【新华社延安二十一日电】美联社上海二十日电：民盟发言人罗隆基在记者招待会上称：“马歇尔使命已经失败，美国错误政策应由美政府负责。我们反对蒋政府任何排除共产党之“改组政府”计划，认为此举势将延长中国内战。罗氏表示不同意目前某些人认为中共提出恢复和谈之二先决条件（恢复去年一月十三日的军事位置与宣布国大无效）是“不可能”的看法。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】据路透社星加坡四日电，华侨领袖陈嘉庚氏称：“……美国若继续片面援助国民党，则整个世界和平不免受其威胁。本人相信：若美国政府能改变其对华政策，则中国法西斯独裁者将无由生存，民主的联合政府亦可成立。”陈氏同时并致电李宗仁，驳斥李前此呼吁美国继续在财政上援助国民党之论点。陈氏谓：“国民政府继续获得美国支援，不免使中国沦为美国之附庸，而使中国人民之子孙成为金元国之奴隶。本人以为，中国目前所需者为停止美国援助国民党，立即建立民主联合政府以代替一党政府。”
