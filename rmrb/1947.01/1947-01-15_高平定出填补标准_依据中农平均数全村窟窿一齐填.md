　　Taiyue, 13th (This Daily) – According to a report from the Gao Ping County Party Committee, Gao Ping County will complete land reform by the end of the lunar year. Currently, 56 villages have realized "land to the tiller," and 434 villages are in the final stages of filling gaps. The 56 villages that have already realized "land to the tiller" mostly adopt the method of a total liquidation or a "one-pot sweep." First, they search for all hidden feudal vestiges and cut them off at once. Then, they clear public property and undistributed fruits. Finally, after investigating the gaps in the entire village that need to be filled, they distribute it all at once. The standard for filling is based on the average of middle peasants in the entire village. If the middle peasants' land is lower than the average per capita land in the village, all gaps in the village are filled together. If the middle peasants' land is higher than the average land, the middle peasants' land remains untouched, and the gaps below are filled. This filling method not only fills the large gaps of poor peasants but also fills the small gaps of middle peasants, without harming the interests of middle peasants. For example, Fenghe Village cut off feudal vestiges, cleared old fruit, and filled the gaps for 21 poor peasant households with 50.08 mu of land, averaging 2 mu per person; families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers averaged 3 mu per person; widows and widowers received 1.5 mu each; and 8 mu were compensated to middle peasants for losses, averaging 0.3 mu per person. Twenty-three mu were given to fugitive households, averaging 2.5 mu per person. Fifty-nine and a half mu were taken care of for small and medium landlords, averaging 3 mu per person. Nineteen and a half mu were given to cleaned-up puppet personnel, averaging 2 mu per person, gaining the support of 98% of the farmers in the entire village. That village obtained 293.5 mu of land in eight days of cutting off feudal vestiges, filling the gaps for 87 poor peasant households who had not completely turned themselves around, averaging 2.2 mu of land per person. Currently, the aforementioned 56 villages have shifted to preparing for the great production movement. (Zheng Dong)

　　高平定出填补标准
    依据中农平均数全村窟窿一齐填
    【本报太岳十三日电】据高平县委报导、高平全县在旧历年底可完成土地改革。目前五十六个村庄已实现耕者有其田，四百卅四个村庄正进行最后填补，其已实现耕者有其田的五十六个村庄，多采取总清算“一锅端”的方式，首先搜索所有隐蔽的封建尾巴，一次割断，然后，再清理公产及未分配的果实，最后经过调查全村需要填补的窟窿，一次分配。其填补的标准是以全村中农的平均数为依据，如中农土地低于全村每人平均数，全村所有窟窿一齐填补；如中农土地高于土地平均数，中农土地不动，填补以下的窟窿，如此填补法，不仅填了贫苦农民的大窟窿，亦补了中农的小窟窿，又毫不损害中农的利益。如风和村斩掉了封建尾巴，清理了旧存果实，给二十一户贫苦农民填补了五十亩零八分土地，每人平均二亩，烈属及军属每人平均三亩；孤寡一亩五分，赔偿中农损失八亩，每人平均三分；给逃亡户二十三亩，平均每人二亩五分；照顾中小地主五十九亩五分，每人平均三亩，洗脸后的伪人员十九亩五分，每人平均二亩；得到全村百分之九十八的农民拥护。那村在八天的割封建尾巴中，得到土地二百九十三亩五分，填补该村八十七户未翻透身的贫苦农民，每人平均土地二亩二分。现上述的五十六个村庄，已转入准备大生产运动。（郑东）
