　　Wu'an Chengguan Inspects the Second Round of the Overthrow Movement; Launches a Large-Scale Struggle Before the Old Year
　　[Wu'an News] More than 60 cadres from various streets in Chengguan gathered at the district office on the 13th of last month to inspect the second round of the overthrow movement. The result of the inspection was unanimous: "The stone slab is still pressing on our heads, and the masses are still leaking through the cracks." In the 13th street, there were still 11 landlord households; in the 14th street, 13 households; in the 15th street, 32 households; and in the 5th street, 30 households whose struggle had not been thorough. In the 3rd street, there are still seven big landlords whose property has mostly not been touched. The landlord Yao Wanquan was struggled against twice, but he used deceptive methods to conceal his property, so nothing was touched; the masses have also not been fully mobilized. In the 13th street, 43 people never spoke at meetings, and in the 5th street, there were 120 backward elements, 50 of whom had not attended a meeting in a year. In the 15th street, 18 people were afraid of a change in the political climate and dared not struggle, 37 were honest farmers, and 13 had served as puppet soldiers or in the "Gedata" team and were afraid of struggle. It was decided to launch another large-scale struggle before the old year to ensure that nothing was left unfinished and no one was left behind. Finally, Political Commissar Xue proposed (1) that each trade should mobilize its members; (2) that cadres and activists should use their own experiences of transforming backward thinking to mobilize the backward. He also emphasized the need to strengthen the study of current events in winter schools to transform the thinking about a change in the political climate.

　　武安城关检查二次翻身运动
    旧年前发动大斗争
    【武安消息】城关各街干部六十多人，上月十三日在区署集会检查第二次翻身运动。检查结果一致认为：“石板还压在头上，群众还漏着窟窿。”地主十三街还有十一户，十四街十三户，十五街三十二户，五街三十户都未斗争彻底。三街尚有七个大地主，财产大部未动。地主姚万全斗过两次，他都用欺骗办法，掩护财产，因此未动一点；群众也还未完全发动起来。十三街有四十三人开会从没说话，五街落后分子一百二十个，有五十个一年里没开过会。十五街怕变天不敢斗争的十八个，老实农民三十七个，当过伪军或疙瘩队怕斗争的十三个。当决定要在旧年前再来个大斗争，作到不留尾巴，不留落后。最后薛政委提出（一）各行人去动员各行人。（二）干部、积极分子以自己过去的落后思想如何转变去动员落后。并着重指出在冬学中要加强时事学习，改造变天思想。
