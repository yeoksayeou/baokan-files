    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] Recently, in Jincheng's "investigation of feudalism," the following ways in which feudal vestiges are concealed have been discovered: 1. Landlords pretend to submit, softening the masses to protect their vestiges. For example, the big landlord Yao San of Wanggen Village, a notorious local tyrant in Jincheng, owned more than 300 mu of land. This spring, because the masses feared a "change of dynasty," they left him 80 mu of good land, and he still keeps eight concubines at home, living a very prosperous life. 2. Dispersing land to reduce the target. For example, a landlord family in Yadao Village privately distributed land to relatives and friends during the mass struggle. The old deeds were not returned, and the new deeds were not established, making it unclear to everyone who actually owned the land. 3. Landlords and bullies give land to institutions and troops for cultivation, blurring the mass struggle. Four bullies in Jincheng gave 70 mu of land to the senior primary school to cultivate. In addition, bullying landlords use various methods to conceal feudal vestiges. In this wave of universally "cutting off feudal vestiges," some experience has been created. Xishi Village started by investigating the fact that three families of twelve people had no quilts to cover themselves, breaking the complacency of the cadres and inspiring the masses to expose the vestiges of landlords and bullies, and settling accounts with the remnants of feudal exploitation in ten households. Currently, cadres throughout the county are going deep into the countryside to conduct thorough inspections and a movement to cut off feudal vestiges.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] The Fourth District of Changzi has begun to level and fill gaps. According to nine administrative villages (twenty-three natural villages), the problems discovered in the investigation of rent reduction include: 1. Peasants have not thoroughly emancipated themselves, feudal vestiges have not been cut off, and old deeds have not been returned. 2. During the period of the great movement, the houses and land returned by landlords and bullies were all converted into rice and sold. Poor peasants could not afford to buy them because they had no rice, and most of them were bought by wealthy households. 3. There are clan fights between villages, and this village does not allow other villages to settle accounts. Based on this, three guidelines were proposed: 1. Cut off feudal vestiges and thoroughly emancipate the peasants. 2. Find the root of poverty and everyone emancipates themselves. 3. Advanced villages help backward villages. Before filling the gaps in each village, peasant representatives are selected to investigate the family circumstances of each household, and then other property is redistributed based on the standard of land distribution, so that everyone is emancipated. In addition to the land that should be distributed to landless and land-poor peasants first; land is not distributed to merchants or handicraft workers who are away from home, but property of equal value is distributed. If handicraft workers and doing business are incidental, they will still be distributed land in the same way as ordinary people, and children can be distributed land in the same way as adults. In the distribution of houses, those without houses are given houses, and those with too many people and not enough living space are also allocated houses so that everyone has a place to live. Finally, food, farm tools, clothing, etc. are matched according to needs to achieve everyone's emancipation. Compensation was also given to the losses of middle peasants during the distribution. After the peasants truly rose up, unity between villages was also natural. For example, Xixiaohe has very little land, with an average of 2.8 mu per person, while Xiaoronghe has an average of 6.2 mu per person. Therefore, the masses of Xiaoronghe voluntarily sold 120 mu of land to Xixiaohe at a low price, and also sent 20 shi of millet to the poor villages of Peijiazhuang, Dong'ao, and Nan'ao to help the masses of those villages emancipate themselves.

    彻底割掉封建尾巴
    晋城深入检查翻身
    长子四区开始填平补齐
    【本报太岳三日电】晋城最近在“查封建”中，已发现封建尾巴掩藏所有以下几种：一、地主伪装屈服，软化群众以保护他的尾巴。如王根村大地主姚三，是晋城有名的大劣绅，家有土地三百余亩。今春因群众怕“变天”，还给他留下八十亩好地，现在家里还养着八个小老婆，生活非常富裕。二、分散土地缩小目标。如衙道村一户地主，在群众斗争时将土地私自分给亲友及有关的人，旧契未退，新契未立，使大家弄不清究竟土地是谁的。三、地主恶霸将土地送给机关部队种，模糊群众斗争。金晨四个恶霸，拿出七十亩土地给高小校种。另外恶霸地主还用各种办法掩藏着封建尾巴。在此次普遍割“封建尾巴”的浪潮中，已创造了些经验，西石村从三家十二口人没有被子盖追起，打破了干部的自满思想，启发群众揭露地主恶霸的尾巴，清算了十户封建剥削残余。目前全县干部正深入农村。进行彻底检查和割封建尾巴运动。
    【本报太岳三日电】长子四区开始填平补齐。据九个行政村（二十三个自然村），在查减中发现的问题有：一、农民未翻透身，封建尾巴未割掉，旧契未退。二、大运动时期地主恶霸退出之房屋土地，皆折合为米出卖，贫苦农民无米买不起，多为富裕户买去。三、村与村之间闹宗派斗争，本村不让外村算账。据此提出了三个方针。一、斩断封建尾巴，使农民彻底翻身。二、找穷根大家翻身。三、先进村帮助落后村。各村进行填补前，皆选出农民代表，调查每户家境，然后以分土地为标准，再分配其他财物，使人人都翻身。对无地少地农民应首先分得土地外；对在外商人或手艺工人，不给分土地，但分得同等价值的财物。如果手艺工人和做买卖是捎带的，仍与一般人同样分得土地，小孩与大人同样可分得土地。房屋的分配，无房分房，而人多不够住者也要分配，使大家都有房住。最后的粮食、农具、衣服等以需要搭配，作到大家翻身。分配中并赔偿了中农的损失。农民真正起来之后，村与村间也自然团结。如西小河土地很少，每人平均二亩八分，小荣河则每人平均六亩二分，于是小荣河群众便自动以贱价出卖给西小河一百二十亩土地，又送给穷村裴家庄、东凹、南凹二十石小米，帮助该村群众翻身。
