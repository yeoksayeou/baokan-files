　　American Anecdotes
    Truman's Nickname
    Since Truman took office, he has gradually colluded with the reactionaries, completely abandoning the New Deal of the late President Roosevelt, causing a lot of turmoil and a public outcry. In public opinion polls, Truman's prestige plummeted. The Gallup poll in July showed that only 43 percent approved of him, while as many as 45 percent disapproved. One newspaper even published a cartoon showing Truman wearing a square hat and being awarded a degree, calling him "Doctor of Incompetence." His fellow countrymen in Missouri call him "a puppy running into the jungle," meaning that he has lost his way under the manipulation of the reactionaries.
    After the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, a treaty selling out China by Chiang Kai-shek, it is said that Chiang Kai-shek was a little afraid of opposition from the Communist Party and the people and did not dare to publish it immediately. However, Truman, in order to appease opposition criticism and ingratiate himself with the monopoly capitalists, impatiently ordered Stuart, the person in charge of the negotiations, and others to publish it before the state elections in the United States. As a result, the disciples and grandsons of Chiang and Song had no choice but to bow their heads and obey. (See Commentary, Issue 2)
  Buffalo Fight
    In his farewell speech in August after resigning as Chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Johnston strongly advocated so-called new capitalism, giving capitalism a beautiful coat. But no matter what, Johnston did see the arrival of the American economic crisis and was determined to prevent it.
    He described the contradictions in American society under the rule of monopoly capital as buffalo fighting. In his speech, he said: "Once the tension of war relaxes, the terror of division, the pressure of greed, and the desire to pursue privilege once again dominate the United States, just like buffalo. When the wolves attack, they form a line to resist. When the enemy is driven back, they start fighting internally." (See Reader's Digest, August issue)
    The economic panic in the United States is getting closer and closer, and the failure of the buffalo fight will inevitably be the victory of the American people's democratic movement.
    The Dissection of the Word "Beauty"
    The American imperialists talk about peace in the Far East and democracy in China, but what they do is wholeheartedly use Chiang Kai-shek to sell China to the United States as a colony. The so-called "mediation" and "arbitration" are all scams of "selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head." Someone deconstructed the word "beauty" (美), saying that the top part is "sheep" (羊) and the bottom part is "dog" (犬), which just illustrates their trick of selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head, which can be said to be a coincidence.

　　美国小事杂话
    杜鲁门的绰号
    棣
    杜鲁门上任后，逐渐和反动派勾结在一起，完全背弃了故罗斯福总统的新政，搞得风波迭起，舆论哗然。民意测验中，杜鲁门威信一落千丈，嘉洛浦民意测验七月间测验的结果，赞成他的只百分之四十三，不赞成的竟达百分之四十五。有一张报纸还登出一幅漫画，给杜鲁门戴上方帽子，授学位，名之曰“一无所能”博士。他的乡亲密苏里的人们把他叫做“钻进丛林中的小狗”，意思也是说他在反动派摆弄之下，迷失道路。
    蒋介石卖国的美蒋商约签订后，据说当时蒋介石有点怕共产党和人民反对，不敢马上发表，但杜鲁门为了搪塞反对派批评，取媚于独占资本家，迫不及待，立令主持谈判的司徒雷登等非在美国州选前发表不可，结果蒋、宋等徒子徒孙之流就只好垂首听命。（见评论报二期）
  野牛角斗
    前美国商会主席庄斯顿八月间在他辞职后话别演说中，大倡所谓新资本主义，给资本主义披了件漂亮的外衣。但不论怎样，庄斯顿确实是看到美国经济危机的到来，而有心防患于未然的。
    他描写独占资本统治下美国社会里的矛盾，比之为野牛角斗。他在演说中说：“战争的紧张一旦弛松，分裂的恐怖，贪婪的压力与追求特权的欲望又统治了美国，好比野牛似的，狼群袭来了，便结阵抵御，敌人被打退了，内部便角斗起来。”（见读者文摘八月号）
    美国的经济恐慌愈来愈近，野牛角斗的失败，必然是美国人民民主运动的胜利。
    “美”字的拆穿
    美帝国主义者开口远东和平，闭口中国民主，而所作所为却是一心一意利用蒋介石把中国出卖给美国作殖民地。所谓“调处”，所谓“仲裁”，同是“挂羊头卖狗肉”的骗局。有人拆字，说美字上面是羊，下面是犬，正说明其挂羊头卖狗肉的勾当，可谓巧合。
