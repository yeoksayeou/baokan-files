    Solving the Land Problem in Exceptionally Poor Villages
    Wuxiang Third District Tries Partial Immigration
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 7th] In order to solve the problem of thoroughly turning over exceptionally poor villages, Wuxiang Third District is trying out immigration measures. During the great examination of turning over in the district this winter, it was discovered that in some particularly poor villages, even after thoroughly settling accounts with landlords, the land owned by the peasants was still insufficient to maintain their livelihoods. The district put forward the slogan: "When dividing the fruits of victory, we must pay attention to turning over every village thoroughly, with rich villages helping poor villages." District cadres personally went to Liyu Village to try out partial immigration. Liyu is the poorest village in the district. Although each person can average four mu of land, the soil quality is extremely poor, mostly sandy soil, and the grain harvested is not enough to eat. When the district cadres raised this suggestion, many peasants agreed. After discussion by the district leadership, it was determined that the villages of Lijiazhuang and Dongshang had more land, and a preliminary decision was made to move people to these two villages, and to discuss this with the masses in those villages. Initially, some people in both villages were unwilling. Later, after enlightening their thinking, especially discussing the two issues of "peasants all over the world are one family" and "rich villages helping poor villages," the village-centrism of some of the masses was broken, and they put forward guarantees saying: "We guarantee that the households that move here will have houses to live in and land to cultivate." In this way, out of the fifty households in Liyu, twenty households moved to Lijiazhuang and Dongshang villages. The remaining thirty households will have enough land to live on, and this "big pit" will be filled.

    解决特别穷苦村土地问题
    武乡三区试行部分移民
    【本报长治七日电】武乡三区试行移民办法，解决特别穷苦村庄的彻底翻身问题。该区今冬翻身大检查中，发现部分特别穷苦的村，彻底清算地主后，农民所有的土地仍不足维持生活。区上提出：“分果实时要注意村村翻透身，富村帮助穷村”的口号。区干亲到李峪村试行部分移民。李峪是该区最穷的村，虽然每人可平均四亩土地，但地质极坏，大部是沙地，打下粮食不够吃。当区干部提出这个意见时，许多农民都很同意。经区领导上讨论，认为李家庄、洞上两村土地较多，即初步决定移至该两村，并与两村群众商讨。起初，两村内都有些群众不愿意，后经启发思想，特别讨论了“天下农民是一家”，富村帮助穷村两个问题，部分群众的村本位主义遂被打破，并提出保证说：“保证移来户有房住有地种。”这样李峪五十户中，即有二十户移至李家庄、洞上两村，留下的三十户，土地即可够生活，这个“大坑洞”也就填平了。
