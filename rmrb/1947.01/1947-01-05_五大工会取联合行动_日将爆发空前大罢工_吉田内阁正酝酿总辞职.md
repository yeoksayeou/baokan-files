　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 31st dispatch: TASS Tokyo dispatch: An unprecedented general strike in Japanese history is scheduled to erupt on January 15, 1947. The Japan Times reported that the general assembly of the five major unions decided on the 28th to call on its members to strike for six days starting on the 15th of next month. These five major unions are the Government Railway Workers' Union, the Public Service Workers' Union, the Transportation Workers' Union, the Government Employees' Union, and the All-Japan Teachers' Union. Each union has immediately agreed to prepare for the strike, and a joint strike committee will be established soon. The common demand of these five major unions is to increase wages or salaries. Previously, the Teachers' Union decided on a major strike on the 23rd, and the Government Employees' Union also decided to strike.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 31st dispatch: Tokyo dispatch: Two days after the closing of the 91st extraordinary session of the Diet, the 92nd session of the Diet opened again on the 28th. At the opening ceremony, the political situation in Tokyo seemed quite calm, but this was only on the surface. In reality, the Yoshida Cabinet is facing a serious crisis. Inflation is growing at a rate of 166.7 million yen per day. As of the 27th, the total amount of currency in circulation has reached 87 billion yen. Simultaneously with this inflation, the cost of living for the people is rising, which is the reason for the recent repeated wage increase demands from trade unions. The 400,000-person demonstration in the middle of this month to overthrow the cabinet further shook the Yoshida Cabinet. According to Tokyo press reports, the total resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet is brewing behind the scenes, with some saying the date will be in early next month. However, two political parties—the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party—are conspiring to split the joint front to overthrow the cabinet, attempting to win over the right-wing faction of the Social Democratic Party led by Suehiro Nishio to join the cabinet. Nishio is eager to try and no longer insists on organizing a cabinet centered on the Social Democratic Party. It is said that negotiations are underway. However, the left-wing group of the party generally opposes participating in a mixed cabinet led by conservatives, insisting on re-electing the Diet. They anticipate that the party will gain the top spot in the improvement.
