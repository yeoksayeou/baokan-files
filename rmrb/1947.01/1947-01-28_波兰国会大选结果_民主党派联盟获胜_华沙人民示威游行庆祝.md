    Polish Parliamentary Election Results
    Democratic Parties Alliance Wins
    Warsaw People Demonstrate and Celebrate
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] Warsaw dispatch: Despite the severe cold and heavy snow, 50,000 Warsaw residents held demonstrations and mass rallies on the 23rd to celebrate the victory of the parliamentary election. Other cities and towns across the country also held a series of mass rallies and parades from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the same afternoon. Speakers at the Warsaw rally praised the victory of the democratic parties' alliance in the parliamentary election as a good omen for Poland's path to peace and reconstruction. The alliance's seat allocation in the parliament is as follows: Workers' Party (Communist Party) 119 seats, Socialist Party 119 seats, Peasants' Party 106 seats, Democratic Party 39 seats. Leaders of the alliance are currently discussing the formation of a new government.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Warsaw dispatch: Preliminary statistics of the Polish general election, as of the 21st, show that the democratic parties and trade union alliance (including the Workers' Party, Peasants' Party, Socialist Party, Democratic Party, and trade unions) have won 383 seats out of the 444 seats in the new parliament. Mikolajczyk's Polish Peasants' Party has won 27 seats.
    [Our dispatch] According to TASS, Moscow, 24th: Pravda recently published an article commenting on the results of the Polish general election, stating: The Polish people unanimously announced on January 19th their decision to continue democratic construction in their lives and to safeguard the interests of peace and security for all nationalities now and in the future. This is the result of the election, which has great historical significance. The preparations for the election and the voting were completed in an atmosphere of unprecedented activity among the broadest masses. In 1947, 89.9 percent of voters participated in the election, while in 1935, only 25 to 30 percent of voters participated in the parliamentary election. The difference between the two is like heaven and earth. Regardless of how slanderers under the direction of "certain foreign aspects" may try to smear it, the election was completed in a completely peaceful atmosphere and in an orderly manner. Impartial observers among the foreign journalists remaining in Poland were forced to confirm this point.

    波兰国会大选结果
    民主党派联盟获胜
    华沙人民示威游行庆祝
    【新华社延安二十五日电】华沙讯：五万华沙居民冒着严寒与大雪，于二十三日举行示威游行与群众大会，庆祝国会选举的胜利。全国其他城乡亦于同日下午六时至七时举行同样的一系列的群众大会与游行。华沙大会上演讲人颂扬国会选举中民主党派联盟的胜利，为波兰走向和平与重建之佳兆。该联盟之国会议席分配为工人党（共产党）一一九席、社会党一一九席、农民党一○六席，民主党三十九席，联盟各领袖现正商谈组织新政府。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】华沙讯：波大选初步统计，截至二十一日止，民主党派与职工会联盟（包括工人党、农民党、社会党、民主党及职工会），已在新国会的四百四十四席中获得三百八十三席。米科拉兹科的波兰农民党，已获二十七席。
    【本报讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：真理报顷著文评论波兰大选之结果称：一月十九日波兰人民曾一致宣布决定继续其生活上的民主建设，保卫各民族人民现在和将来之和平与安全的利益，这就是具有重大历史意义的选举结果。选举的准备和投票均在最广大群众之空前活跃的气氛中完成。一九四七年有百分之八十九点九选民参加选举，而一九三五年仅有百分之二十五至三十的选民参加国会选举，二者相比，真有天渊之别。不管“在某国外方面”指使下的怀疑者如何污蔑，然而选举仍在完全和平的空气下完成，而且秩序井然，留在波兰的外国新闻记者中的公正观察家们，都不得不证实此点。
