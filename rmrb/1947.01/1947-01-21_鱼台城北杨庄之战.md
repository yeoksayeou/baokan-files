The Battle of Yangzhuang North of Yutai City

After more than a hundred of our troops were surrounded by the enemy, they still fought bravely and tenaciously for a whole day, vowing never to surrender.
They repelled seven enemy counterattacks and finally, in coordination with our troops outside the village, annihilated an entire regiment of the enemy.

[Dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front, this newspaper, 19th] Special correspondent Li Pu of Xinhua News Agency reports: From January 8th to 9th, General Liu Bocheng's troops annihilated more than 8,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops led by Fang Xianjue, commander of the 88th Division, in the outer suburbs of Yutai, Southwest Shandong. The battle of Yangzhuang, ten miles north of Yutai city, was the most intense in this battle. Fang Xianjue's main force, the 186th Regiment, was stationed in Yangzhuang, being the only stubborn resister in the overall situation. A certain unit of the Eighth Route Army broke into the village at 11 p.m. on the 8th, occupied more than a dozen houses facing south, but the battle was not yet resolved, and dawn had broken. The breakthrough point was blocked by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and reinforcements could not continue. The telephone line was also cut off. The small number of troops that entered the village were trapped in a serious encirclement. Subsequently, they were cut into two halves by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, each with about sixty or seventy people, and communication between them was cut off. They all thought that the others had all been sacrificed.

After two failed counterattacks by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, they concentrated the regiment's light and heavy weapons and intensively bombarded the area with mountain guns from Yutai city. Shells, grenades, and machine-gun bullets rained down like a storm. Houses collapsed, walls crumbled, and the noisy shouts and bugle calls of the Chiang Kai-shek troops were heard all around. These dozen or so houses were swaying in a sea of blood and fire. The warriors used all their strength and methods to fight back heroically. One soldier injured his right eye and aimed with his left eye. By 8 a.m. on the 9th, the part commanded by Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Qinghe was compressed into three courtyards. Ammunition ran out, the houses were on fire, and even the clothes of both sides' casualties were burned by incendiary bombs. The Chiang Kai-shek troops continued to press forward, and the situation was extremely tense. Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Qinghe immediately convened an emergency cadre meeting, appealing to everyone with the glorious title of Communist Party member to resolutely defend to the death and never surrender. He also organized soldiers, staff officers, guards, communication soldiers, medical personnel, scouts, and political workers into the battle, each taking up the guns and ammunition of the dead, sticking to their posts until they repelled the seventh counterattack of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, when the Chiang Kai-shek troops' momentum gradually weakened.

The part commanded by Company Commander Wu Yongfu was in even greater danger. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops charged into the courtyard during the third counterattack, they killed six Chiang Kai-shek troops with machine guns. When the remaining Chiang Kai-shek troops rushed into the east room, Company Commander Wu directed more than ten soldiers to charge in with knives for close-quarters combat. The Chiang Kai-shek troops continued to counterattack from behind, setting the north room on fire. Company Commander Wu immediately sent people to break a hole in the west wall of the north room. Just as they had moved over, the main beam of the north room collapsed.

Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang only learned about Company Commander Wu's situation in the afternoon and immediately launched a counterattack. First, they captured an independent house facing south, captured twenty-three Chiang Kai-shek troops alive from under the bed and among the dead. Once the threat from the side was eliminated, the situation immediately changed, and they resumed the offensive position. Although Fang Xianjue's troops were twenty or thirty times larger in number, they were now greatly panicked and in a defensive position. At 3 p.m., six of the seven telephone operators in the encirclement had fallen, and the seventh finally erected the telephone line and made contact with the outside. Finally, the night that had been awaited all day gradually arrived. The Eighth Route Army besieged from all sides outside the village, coordinating from inside and outside, and Fang Xianjue's main regiment was completely annihilated in the twilight.

　　鱼台城北杨庄之战
    我军某部百余人陷入敌围后，仍然英勇顽强的作战一整天，誓死不投降，
    打退敌人七次反扑，终于和村外我军配合，把敌人一个团全部消灭。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十九日电】新华社特派记者李普报导：一月八日至九日，刘伯承将军所部于鲁西南鱼台外围歼灭八十八师师长方先觉率领的蒋军八千余人，这一仗以鱼台城北十里的杨庄战斗最为激烈。方先觉的主力一八六团驻于杨庄，为全局中唯一顽强的抵抗者，八路军某部于八日晚十一时突入村内，占领坐北朝南的房屋十多间，战斗尚未解决而天已大明，突破口为蒋军封锁，后援无法继续，电话也被剪断，攻入村内的少数部队乃陷于严重的包围中。随即又被蒋军切为两半，各约六七十人，彼此联络断绝，都以为别人已全部牺牲。
    蒋军两次反扑失败后，便集中全团轻重火器，配合鱼台城内的山炮密集轰击，炮弹手榴弹和机枪弹有如狂风暴雨，房子塌了，垣围倒了，四面又是蒋军嘈杂的喊声和冲锋号，这十多间房子便在血和火之海里飘摇。勇士们用尽一切力量和方法英勇还击，有一个战士打伤了右眼，便用左眼瞄准。到九号清晨八点钟，副团长张庆和指挥的一部被压缩到三座院落内，弹药打完了，房子烧着了，连双方牺牲者的衣服都被燃烧弹烧着了。而蒋军则仍在继续逼进，形势紧张万分。副团长张庆和立即召开紧急干部会议，以共产党员的光荣称号号召大家坚决死守，决不投降。并把战士、参谋、警卫员、通讯员、卫生人员、侦察员、政工人员等统统组入战斗，各人拿起死者身上的枪支和弹药，坚守岗位，直到打退蒋军第七次反扑，蒋军声势才逐渐衰竭。
    连长吴永富指挥的一部更加危险，在蒋军第三次反扑冲进院落时，他们用机枪打死六个蒋军，其余蒋军扑进东屋，吴连长便指挥十多个战士持刀冲进去，进行室内厮杀，蒋军又从背后继续反扑，把北屋烧着。吴连长立即派人把北屋西墙打一破洞，当他们和彩号刚刚转移过去，北屋大梁就随之塌下。
    张副团长到下午才知道吴连长的消息，立即进行反攻；首先夺下坐南朝北的独立房屋，从床底下和死尸中活捉蒋军二十三人，侧面威胁既经解除，形势马上改变，恢复了攻击地位。方先觉部人数虽在二三十倍以上，这时已大感慌张，处于退守之势。下午三点钟，重围中的七个电话员倒了六个，第七个终于把电线架起，和外面取得联系。最后，盼望了一整天的夜幕终于渐渐到来，村外八路军四面围攻，里外配合，方先觉的这个主力团便在暮色苍茫之中全部覆灭。
