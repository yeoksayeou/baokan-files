    *Taihang Xinhua Daily* Publishes Editorial
    Calling for Full Operation of All Textile Machines in the Region

    [Another Dispatch] The *Taihang Xinhua Daily* published an editorial on the 19th calling for a vigorous spring textile campaign to overcome the current serious economic difficulties. The article first pointed out that last winter, for three months, women's participation in the emancipation movement was not combined with production, resulting in a reduction of more than three million jin of homespun cloth. The entire region's daily market supply of homespun cloth was less than ten thousand jin, a six-fold decrease compared to previous years. If we do not catch up quickly, massively spinning and producing, Taihang will be short of five to six million jin of cloth, and military and civilian needs will be impossible to meet. It calls on every household to spin yarn, every village to weave cloth, to achieve self-sufficiency and strive for prosperity. It calls for all spinning wheels and looms in the region to be fully operational. It also advocates increasing quantity, improving quality, promoting hand-pulled looms, and improving spinning wheels. It also urges overcoming the undesirable traditions of technological conservatism and rough finished products. The article then pointed out that future emancipation movements in various regions should be combined with textile production and should not be relaxed in the slightest. It is imperative to resolve the region's military and civilian needs within the urgent timeframe of spring. The article appealed to cooperatives and women throughout the region to mobilize urgently.

    太行新华日报发表社论
    号召全区纺织机完全开动
    【又讯】太行新华日报于十九日发表社论号召大力开展春季纺织运动以克服当前的严重经济困难。该文首指出去冬三月因妇女参加翻身运动未与生产结合，致土布减产三百万斤以上，全区每日土布上市不足万斤，较之往年减低六倍。如不急起直追，大量纺织大量生产，太行将缺布五百到六百万斤，军需民用势将无法自给。号召家家纺纱，村村织布，作到自给争取富裕。号召全区所有纺车与织布机完全开动起来。并发展数量，提高质量，推广手拉梭机与改进纺车。克服技术保守成品粗糙的不良传统。继即指出各地今后翻身运动应与纺织结合，不能丝毫放松，必须在春季紧迫的时间内解决全区军需民用。该文呼吁全区合作社与全区妇女紧急动员起来。
