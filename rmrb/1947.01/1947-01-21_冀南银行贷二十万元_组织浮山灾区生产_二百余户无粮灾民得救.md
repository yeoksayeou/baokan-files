　　Jinnan Bank Loans 200,000 Yuan
    Organizes Production in Fushan Disaster Area
    Over 200 Grain-less Disaster-stricken Households Saved
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 19th] Jinnan Bank issued loans of 200,000 yuan to organize the masses in the hail-stricken areas of Fushan Fancun and other places to engage in transportation and textile work, overcoming the famine. Fancun and other areas in the Third District suffered from a hailstorm last August, destroying crops. Two hundred and fifty-four peasant households in the area were now without grain and urgently needed relief. Staff members of the Jinnan Bank's Fushan branch immediately went to organize men and women for transportation and textile work. Currently, seventeen transportation teams have been organized in Tucun, Zhangyuan, and Yuantou in Fancun, transporting grain and coal. Loans were also provided to local female textile workers to improve textile tools and purchase shuttle machines, enabling over 70% of the female textile workers in the area to learn how to use them, thereby increasing textile efficiency.
