    U.S. Military's Atrocities in China
    Ben Bao Zi Liao Shi
    In the past year, the atrocities committed by U.S. troops in China have been endless. They have not regarded China as an independent nation, and have arbitrarily violated Chinese women. The shameful Chiang government has not only failed to protest and curb these atrocities, but has instead forgotten that they are Chinese and defended the U.S. military's actions.
    Based solely on the newspaper materials at hand, there are eight major cases of U.S. military atrocities. The rape case of a Peking University female student is not included.
    According to Shanghai Zheng Yan Bao, on the night of March 15th last year, a woman surnamed Deng on Xinchang Road was followed and forcibly raped by four U.S. soldiers while returning home. On April 10th, Shanghai Xin Bao reported that a female middle school student was passing Xiqiao Lane, where the "American Servicemen's Club" was located, after school when two American sailors jumped out of a rickshaw and "grabbed a female student like an eagle catching a chick, dragged her back into the car, and hugged her wildly."
    Wen Hui Bao published on August 25th a reader's account by Jiang Hanmin, who witnessed U.S. troops insulting Chinese women: "Last night, I was walking with a friend on Nanjing West Road when, about six or seven storefronts east of the International Hotel, we saw three American sailors walking eastward in a frenzy. Whether they were drunk or feigning madness, they swayed from left to right as they walked. A young woman, about 25 years old, happened to be walking past them when one of the American soldiers shamelessly groped her chest. The woman was enraged by this sudden act of violence and struggled fiercely to escape their clutches." It also published on September 13th: "Chen Zhaodi, a young woman from Changshu, lived upstairs at No. 2 Fushoufang, Dalian Road, Hongkou. Yesterday morning at around midnight, she took a mat outside to sleep because it was too hot to sleep indoors. Unexpectedly, two drunken American soldiers passed by, woke her up, and forcibly assaulted her. Chen was terrified and resisted firmly, which angered the American soldiers. They kicked her head and chest repeatedly with their leather shoes, causing Chen serious injuries. Four of her front teeth were knocked out, her face was covered in blood, and her body was covered in bruises, a truly horrific sight." The Shanghai News reported on September 17th: "Zhou Gendi, a dancer at the Ciro's nightclub on Nanjing Road, was abducted by a Filipino American soldier to the racecourse, where he attempted to rape her. Zhou resisted with all her might and was beaten unconscious. Two hundred thousand legal tender yuan, five U.S. dollar bills, and a new dress were stolen from her purse." On October 6th, three U.S. soldiers broke into the home of a young woman at No. 43 Changyang Road. The woman fled, taking refuge in the Shenpei Middle School next door. The three U.S. soldiers followed her, smashing the school's screen."
    On June 28th, four U.S. soldiers in Chongqing openly broke into the women's bathroom of the Huixian Mansion Hotel, subjecting the women who were bathing to all kinds of insults. They then gathered more than 20 U.S. soldiers and extensively vandalized the hotel.
    In Nanjing—the so-called national capital—on September 1st, two sisters-in-law of a civil servant surnamed Zhang, who lived on Zhongshan North Road, were kidnapped by two U.S. soldiers on their way home from the theater. One sister-in-law struggled and escaped, but the other was dragged to a lawn and raped for an hour, suffering serious chest injuries. Zhang Shaoqing, the captain of the Chiang military police, witnessed the incident but did not intervene.
    In addition, U.S. troops in Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and along the Beining Railway openly harassed women on the streets, or threw firecrackers, paper balls, wine bottles, etc., at women, their various ugly behaviors were too numerous to mention.
    These atrocities committed by U.S. troops have aroused the indignation of every conscientious Chinese person. The protest movement sparked by the rape of Ms. Shen of Peking University is the beginning of a "wave of anger." We believe that, through the resolute struggle of the people across the country, these evil things will one day be driven out of China.

    美军在华的兽行
    本报资料室
    一年来，美军在华的兽行是层出不穷的，他们没有把中国看做一个独立的国家，竟任意蹂躏中国的妇女；而可耻的蒋政府，不仅没有抗议与遏制这些兽行，相反的却忘记了自己是中国人，而反为美军此种兽行张目。
    仅就手头的报纸材料统计，重大的美军兽行案件即有八件。北大女生被强奸案件还不计算在内。
    据上海正言报载，去年三月十五日夜，新昌路邓姓之女由外归家，竟被四美兵跟踪闯入，强行奸淫。四月十日上海辛报载，某女中学生放学经过“美国军人俱乐部”所在地的斜桥弄，两个美国水兵从三轮车上跳出，“老鹰抓小鸡般地抓住一个女学生，拖回车上，狂搂着她”。
    文汇报八月二十五日刊载，读者蒋汉民叙述目睹美军侮辱中国妇女的事实说：“昨夜我同一个友人在南京西路散步，当行至距国际饭店东约六、七家门面的地方，见有三个美国水兵疯狂地向东走路，不知是喝醉了酒，抑或故装疯态，走起路来，忽而闯向左，忽而往右偏。恰好一个年约二十五岁左右的女郎，走过他们身边，其中一个美兵，毫无廉耻的将该女子胸前乱摸，那女子被这突然的暴行气极，狠命的挣扎，才逃出了魔掌”。九月十三日刊载：“常熟少妇陈招弟，住虹口大连路福寿坊二号通街楼上，昨晨零时许，因天气炎热，室内无法入睡，遂持席外出露宿，讵料突有酗酒美兵二名，道经该处，竟将其叫醒，强行非礼，陈大骇，当予坚拒，致激怒美兵，竟以皮鞋向伊头胸各部猛踢乱踏，陈妇当受重伤，门牙四枚脱落，血流满面，遍体鳞伤，为状至惨”。九月十七日上海新闻报载：“南京中路仙乐斯舞厅伴舞周根弟，被菲籍美兵挟至跑马厅马坪上，欲行奸污，周女力拒，被打晕在地，皮箧内法币两万元，美金票五元，新衣一件均被劫去”。十月六日上海美兵士三人，闯入长阳路四十三号一少妇家，该少妇夺门逃避，逃入隔壁申培中学校内，三美兵跟踪追往，将学校屏风打烂。”
    六月二十八日，重庆美兵四名，竟公然闯入会仙大厦旅社女浴室，对正在沐浴的妇女百般侮辱，复纠集美兵二十余人，将该旅社大肆捣毁。
    在南京——所谓国都所在地，九月一日住中山北路公务员张某之妻妹二人，晚间观剧归来，为美兵二人绑架，其妹挣扎逃脱，其妻则被拉至某草坪上强奸达一小时之久，胸部重伤，蒋宪兵队长张绍卿目睹不救。
    此外，在北平、天津、青岛及北宁路沿线的美军，平日公然在大街上调戏行路妇女，或者用鞭炮、纸团、酒瓶……，向妇女投掷，种种丑态，不一而足。
    美军的这些兽行，已引起了每一个有良心的中国人的愤慨，北大沈女士被强奸案所引起各地的抗议的运动，就是“愤怒的浪潮”的开始，我们相信，在全国人民的坚决斗争下，终有一天叫这些坏东西滚出中国去。
