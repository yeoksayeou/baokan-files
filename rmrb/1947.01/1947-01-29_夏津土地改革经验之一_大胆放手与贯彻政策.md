One of the Xiajin Land Reform Experiences:
    Boldly Letting Go and Implementing Policies
    Xi Congzhen, Wang Bohua
    In terms of methods for leading the mass movement, we lacked experience in the past. We needed to both boldly let go, opposing doing everything for the masses, and emphasize policies to prevent deviations. The actual movement was complex and full of changes, so it caused some debate at the Xiajin County Committee meeting on September 12th. Based on a review of three months of work, in terms of leadership principles, in the early stage of the movement, to break the ice and stir up the movement, we put forward the principle of "as long as the struggle is against traitors, evil bullies, and feudal landlords, as long as it is a genuine action by the broad masses, boldly support the masses and let them do it freely," which was correct. Under this principle, most cadres adopted the approach of publicly exposing the crimes of feudal society and sympathizing with the suffering of the masses under feudal oppression and exploitation, expressing our determination to take the lead in the masses' liberation. We publicly proclaimed the legality of the mass emancipation movement and the illegality of feudal oppression and exploitation to everyone. As a result, the masses felt that we were strong and reliable, greatly reducing their fear and timidity towards feudal forces, and increasing their confidence and courage. The landlords, seeing so many of our cadres in the villages and hearing our public announcement of our attitude of supporting the masses, felt that "resistance is futile anyway," greatly reducing their courage to resist. Therefore, in each district, the struggle situation was opened up throughout the district in less than half a month. Experience has shown that simply paying attention to public propaganda and support cannot truly mobilize the masses. Several villages in District One failed in this way. After public propaganda, it is necessary to immediately conduct individual interviews, go to the masses to discover activists, and through them, based on the voluntary will of the masses, conduct secret liaison, first organizing a group of relatively active masses, looking for certain opportunities to go public, obtain legal status, and then openly absorb the broad masses to participate in and carry out the struggle. Comrades who adopted this method of combining the open and the secret were successful in their work. Some other comrades, neglecting the role of public propaganda and support, adhered to the past method of purely secret liaison. As a result, the masses did not have confidence in us because they felt we lacked boldness. Because our attitude was ambiguous, the legality of the feudal system in the village and the mass emancipation movement were unclear, which gave the feudal forces many convenient opportunities for activity. Villages that did this could not break the ice for a long time. In terms of implementing policies, some comrades were afraid of restricting the masses' hands and feet, and initially advocated not emphasizing policies. They believed that as long as the masses were mobilized, that would be enough. This was because they regarded policies as circles. The disadvantage of this statement is that the struggle does not have a clear direction at the beginning, and it is easy to have some deviations. After the masses rise up, the more the deviations develop, the more difficult it becomes to correct them. At the beginning of launching the struggle, many problems have not yet arisen. Proposing a large set of policies will indeed restrict the masses' hands and feet, which is harmful and useless; but without a clear direction, the movement will lose its goal. Therefore, we initially proposed: "As long as we struggle against feudal landlords," thus defining a simple goal, "As long as it is a genuine action by the broad masses," thus defining simple conditions, "Boldly support the masses and let them do it freely," thus pointing out the working methods and breaking the cadres' worries. We believe that this is the guiding principle and specific policy at the beginning of the launching period. This movement in Xiajin was launched quickly from the beginning, hit accurately, and did not have any major deviations, mainly because of this clear policy. We believe that the mass movement, from beginning to end, is a movement with policies; without policies, there is no direction, and we will take detours. Policies are not fixed circles, not dead rules, but must rely on the party's basic spirit, and be proposed in a timely manner according to objective needs and environmental changes.

    夏津土地改革经验之一
    大胆放手与贯彻政策
    习从真  王伯华
    在领导群众运动的方法上，过去我们没有经验，既要大胆放手反对包办代替，又要强调政策，防止偏向。实际运动中又是那样复杂与变化多端，所以在九月十二号的夏津县委会议上，曾引起了一度争论。根据三个月的工作来检查，在领导方针方面，运动初期，为了打开局面，将运动掀起来，我们提出了“只要斗争的是汉奸恶霸封建地主，只要是真正的广大群众行动，大胆给群众撑腰，放手让群众去干”的方针是对的。在这个方针之下，大部分干部都采用公开揭发封建社会的罪恶与同情群众在封建压迫剥削下的痛苦，表明我们要为群众的翻身作主。公开向一切人宣传群众翻身运动的合法，封建压迫剥削的非法。这样一来，群众觉得我们有力可靠，大大减低了他们对封建势力的恐怖畏缩，提高了他们的信心和勇气。地主方面看到我们这样多的干部到各村，又听到我们公开宣布了为群众撑腰的态度，感觉“反正挡不住了”，大大降低了他们反抗的勇气。所以在各区均不到半月的工夫，就打开了全区的斗争局面。经验证明了，只注意公开宣传撑腰并不能将群众真正发动起来，一区有几个村子是这样失败的。在公开宣传之后，须要紧接着进行个别访问，到群众中去发现积极分子,经过他们，根据群众的自愿，去进行秘密串连，先将一部分比较积极的群众组织起来，寻找一定的机会，公开出去，取得合法地位，再公开吸收广大群众参加，开展斗争。采取这种公开与秘密结合方法的同志，工作是成功的。另有一些同志，忽视公开宣传撑腰的作用，保守着过去单纯秘密串连的办法。结果群众见我们气魄不大，没有信心。由于我们的态度暧昧，对村中封建制度和群众翻身运动谁合法，谁非法，混淆不清，更给封建势力保留了很多活动的便利机会。这样做的村庄，好长时间打不开局面。在贯彻政策方面，有的同志恐怕束缚了群众的手脚，在一开始主张不要强调提政策，他们认为只要群众动起来就好。这是因为他们把政策看成了圈子。这样提法的坏处，是使斗争一开始没有明确的方向，容易发生某些偏向，等到群众起来之后，偏向越发展越严重，就越不好纠正了。在开始发动斗争时，好多问题还没有产生。便提出一大套政策，确实会束缚群众的手脚，是有害无利的；但没有明确的方向就会使运动失掉目标。所以我们一开始提出：“只要斗争封建地主”，这样就确定了简单的目标，“只要是真正广大群众的行动”，这样确定了简单的条件，“大胆给群众撑腰，放手让群众去干”，这样就指出了工作方法，打破了干部的顾虑。我们认为这就是在开始发动时期的指导方针与具体政策。夏津这次运动，一开始就发动的很快，打的很准，没出什么大的偏差，主要是有这个明确政策的缘故。我们认为群众运动，自始至终，都是有政策的运动；没有政策就没有方向，就要走弯路，政策不是固定的圈子，不是死条文，而是要以党的基本精神作依靠，根据客观的需要与环境的变化，及时提出来的。（冀南分社）
