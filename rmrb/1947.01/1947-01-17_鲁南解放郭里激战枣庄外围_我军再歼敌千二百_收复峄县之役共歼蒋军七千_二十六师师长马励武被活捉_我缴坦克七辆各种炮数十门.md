Xinhua News Agency, Lunan Front, 14th: Amidst the great victory of the Lunan People's Liberation Army in liberating Yixian, they followed up by recovering Guoli, located ten kilometers east of Zaozhuang, which had been occupied by Chiang's troops. In this battle, the enemy's 114th Brigade, 341st Regiment headquarters of the 51st Division, and two battalions were annihilated. Over a thousand men, including the regimental commander, were captured, and over two hundred were killed or wounded. Fierce fighting is currently underway on the outskirts of Zaozhuang.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 14th: In the victorious battle to recover Yixian city in Lunan on the 11th, the East China People's Liberation Army annihilated over 7,000 Chiang troops. This counter-offensive began on the evening of the 10th. After five hours of intense fighting, the city was completely recovered by 2:00 AM on the 11th. The results of the battle are as follows: The 341st Regiment headquarters and part of × battalions of the 114th Brigade of the 51st Division stationed near Zaozhuang, the entire 98th Regiment of the 33rd Brigade of the 52nd Division, the remnants of the 26th Division numbering six to seven hundred, the puppet troops of Wang Hongjiu numbering seven to eight hundred, and one battalion each of heavy artillery and mountain artillery, totaling over 7,000 men, were completely annihilated. Over 5,000 officers and soldiers, including the 114th Brigade Commander Li Buqing, were captured, over 2,000 were killed or wounded, and seven tanks, over twenty trucks, nine mountain guns, eight field guns, six anti-tank guns, dozens of large and small mortars, over forty heavy machine guns, over two hundred light machine guns, countless rifles and short guns, and thousands of rounds of various artillery shells and hundreds of thousands of bullets were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Lunan, 15th: Ma Liwu, the commander of the 26th Division (formerly the commander of the 26th Army before reorganization) and the highest-ranking commander of Chiang's troops invading Lunan, was captured by the East China People's Liberation Army in the battle to liberate Yixian, an important county town on the Tai'erzhuang-Zaozhuang branch line of the Jinpu Railway, on the 11th. In addition to over 5,000 soldiers, Li Buqing, the commander of the 114th Brigade of the 51st Division, and many other regimental and brigade-level officers were also captured in the city and are currently being identified.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th: The Central China Democratic Allied Army celebrated the anniversary of its "January 9th" uprising with a victory in which they annihilated over 400 enemy troops in a self-defense counterattack. On the night of the 8th, the Allied Army counterattacked Chiang's troops in Zhazhuang, Fuan, and other places west and north of Xinpu (on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway). The commanders and fighters of the Allied Army bravely took the lead, advanced through the water, and fought fiercely until dawn, destroying Chiang's troop outposts at Maokou and other data points. After completing the mission, they calmly withdrew. In this battle, over 400 officers and soldiers of the U.S.-equipped Chiang army's 57th Division, including battalion and company commanders, were killed.

Xinhua News Agency, Lunan Front, 14th: On the morning of the 5th, this reporter saw twenty-four U.S.-made howitzers, recently captured by the People's Liberation Army, on the battlefield east of Lanling. Each gun was being towed by a ten-wheeled truck. Except for a few guns that had lost some parts, the vast majority were intact. Newly liberated Chiang army drivers and gunners were busy repairing the machinery. After a series of heavy motorcycle sounds, the twenty-four heavy guns were towed by their original trucks toward the People's Liberation Army's garrison on the east side of the highway. A gunner who had been liberated yesterday told me, "These guns were specifically intended for attacking Linyi. When this battle began, our commanders thought that these heavy guns would not even be needed to capture Linyi, so not a single shot was fired. By the time the situation became urgent, your army's infantry had already rushed close, and the heavy guns had lost their effectiveness. In a very short time, these heavy guns changed masters and were transferred to your army's hands."

    【新华社鲁南前线十四日电】记者于五日清晨在兰陵以东的战地上，见到刚被人民解放军缴获的二十四门美造榴弹炮，每一门都用十轮大卡车牵引着，除有很少几门炮丢掉些零件外，绝大多数均完整无损。刚被解放的蒋军驾驶员和炮手们，正忙着修理机件。在一阵沉重的摩托声响后，二十四门重炮便被用原来的汽车牵引着开向公路东侧人民解放军驻地去了。一个昨天被解放过来的炮手告诉我：“这些炮是特为进攻临沂使用的，当此次战斗开始时，我们的指挥官尚以为用不到这些重炮就可把临沂攻下，以致一炮也没有发；及至情况紧急时，贵军步兵则已扑至近前，重炮已失去作用，在极短的时间内，这些重炮就换了主人，转送到贵军手里了。”
