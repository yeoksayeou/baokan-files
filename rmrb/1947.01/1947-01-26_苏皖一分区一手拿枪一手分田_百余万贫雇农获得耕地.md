Through methods such as men doing logistics, women dividing land, shooting guns in one hand and calculating accounts in the other, fighting guerrillas during the day and dividing land at night, attacking the enemy in the south and holding meetings to divide land in the north, out of the district's one thousand and five villages, excluding the one hundred and eighty-nine villages occupied by Chiang, the remaining eight hundred and sixteen villages (including those repeatedly contested by Chiang and us), as of the end of last September, seven hundred and forty-three villages (accounting for more than seventy-four percent of the entire area) had completely finished the land distribution work, and more than one million poor and landless peasants obtained land to cultivate. In Taibei County (Dongtai) alone, 174,800 people were allocated land. After gaining land, the broad masses of people poured into the tide of the patriotic self-defense war. Within half a year, more than a million men and women participated in logistics work. In the three months of August, October, and December last year alone, 1,038 liberated peasants joined the army, among whom the Taixing ×× District, where land reform was most thorough, had 943 people joining the army. In half a year, the military and civilians of the First District jointly fought 4,301 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 540 Chiang soldiers.
