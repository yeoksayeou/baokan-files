    Yicheng Landlords Fleeing Return Home
    Democratic Government Allocates Grain for Relief and Returns Managed Land, Houses, and Grain
    [Our newspaper Taiyue 3rd dispatch] Some landlords from Yicheng who fled into the city's Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan strongholds before liberation, not understanding the greater good, have returned to the liberated areas due to the abuse by Chiang and Yan's troops, including Wang Yunfeng and over 20 others. Note: Wang Yunfeng is from Xiashimen Village in Yicheng, who used to make a living by lending at high interest rates. When Chiang's troops invaded Yicheng in September of this year, he fled into the city under the deceptive propaganda of Chiang's troops' "protection of landlords." However, because Chiang and Yan's troops heavily taxed and conscripted them, and they suffered from cold and hunger, Wang resolutely led his entire family (four people) back. Our democratic government, in addition to allocating one *shi* of millet for relief, also returned all of his managed land of 20 *mu*, eight *shi* of grain, two houses, and one cart that were managed during his escape. According to the returned landlords, landlords fleeing into the city must also find a wealthy guarantor, carry eight months of food rations, and be organized to serve in the military, with the old and weak participating in labor service, bearing particularly heavy burdens.

    翼城逃亡地主返里
    民主政府拨粮救济并发还代管地房粮食
    【本报太岳三日电】翼城解放前逃入城内蒋阎据点的不明大义之地主，因不堪蒋阎军虐待，有王云风等二十余人重归解放区。按：王云风是翼城下石门村人，过去放高利贷为生，于今年九月蒋军侵占翼城时，在蒋军“保护地主”的欺骗宣传下逃入城内；但因蒋阎军对他们横征暴敛，抓差抓丁，他们备受冻饿，王便毅然带领全家（四口人）归来。我民主政府除拨给小米一石救济外，并将其在逃亡时代管的土地二十亩、粮食八石、房屋两所、小车一辆，全部发还。据逃回地主称：逃入城内的地主亦须找殷实铺保，携带八个月食粮，并要编组服兵役，老弱参加差役，负担特别苛重。
