　　Economic Crisis Inevitable
    US Production Reaches Peak
    Truman Issues Economic Report, Reveals Attempt to "Seek Sales Outlets for Goods."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] Washington Dispatch: The United States is on the eve of a serious economic crisis of overproduction, and its production has reached its peak. This is the impression gained by some observers after US President Truman issued his economic report to Congress this year on the 8th. Truman's report pointed out that US production and employment reached their highest peaks last year. It is estimated that, based on last winter's figures, the total national production has reached an annual rate of 250.5 billion US dollars, with employment at 58 million, an increase of 10 million compared to 1940 and an increase of 1 million compared to the wartime peak. The report revealed the White House's extreme concern about how to maintain this level and how to obtain sales for such a huge amount of production. The report particularly emphasized the issue of foreign trade, stating: "The income obtained by the United States from selling goods and services abroad has recently reached a figure of 15 billion US dollars annually." This figure includes the sale of surplus materials and exports under the Lend-Lease Act. In reality, commercial exports are far greater than this. Taking last year's highest export month (August) as an example, the total value was only 882.2 million US dollars. Therefore, how to achieve 15 billion US dollars in commercial exports is the biggest problem for the United States this year. Truman said in his report: "There is no doubt that other countries are willing to increase purchases of our (referring to the United States) goods and loans, and if so, our exports will decrease." Truman also said: "The extent to which the world market absorbs the United States' surplus domestic goods will largely depend on our international economic policy. This is true of commercial import and overseas investment policies." Truman stated the necessity of concluding "foreign trade" agreements with other countries. (According to Republican congressmen, they recently opposed "reciprocity" and advocated unilateral "open door" policies for other countries, and said that the United States has invited 18 countries to hold an international trade conference this autumn.) Truman stated in the conclusion of his report that government agencies should continue to study "ways to resist economic shocks."

　　经济危机不可避免
    美生产达顶点
    杜鲁门发表经济报告，透露正图“觅寻商品销路”。
    【新华社延安十一日电】华盛顿讯：美国正处在严重的生产过剩的经济危机之前夕，其生产已达顶点。这是美总统杜鲁门八日发表其今年致国会的经济报告后若干观察家所得的印象。杜氏报告中，指出去年美国生产与就业已达最高峰。据估计，按去年冬季之数字计算，全国生产总数字已达每年二千零五十亿美元之数率，就业人数为五千八百万，较一九四○年增加一千万，较战时最高数字亦增加一百万。该报告透露白宫方面极其关切如何保持此一水平及如何获得如此庞大生产品的销路问题。报告特别着重提出对外贸易问题，据称：“美国由于向国外销售物资及服务所得之收入，最近已达每年一百五十亿美元之数字。”按此一数字系包括剩余物资之出售与租借法案项下之输出在内，实际上商业输出远过于此，以去年输出最高一月（八月份）而言，总值仅八亿八千二百万美元。故如何实现一百五十亿元商业输出乃今年美国之最大难题。杜氏于报告中所谓：“他国愿否增加购买我国（指美国）物资及借款不无疑虑，如是则我国之输出即将减少。”杜氏又称：“世界市场吸收美国输出国内过剩物资之数率多寡，大部将视我国之国际经济政策而定。商业上输入及海外投资之政策为然。”杜氏申言与他国订立“对外贸易”之必要。（按共和党议员近反对“互惠”，而主张他国单方面的“门户开放”，并谓美国已邀请十八国于今秋举行国际贸易会议。）杜氏报告结语中申言政府机关继续研究“抵制经济震荡之办法”。
