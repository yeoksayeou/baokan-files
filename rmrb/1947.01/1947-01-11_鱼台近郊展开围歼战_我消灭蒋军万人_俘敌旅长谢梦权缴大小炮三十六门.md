[Urgent Dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front, This Newspaper, 10th] The encirclement and annihilation battle in the outskirts of Yutai continues to expand its results. From the 8th to the afternoon of the 9th, nearly 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops, amounting to one and a half brigades, were annihilated. This includes the complete annihilation of the 186th Regiment of the 62nd Brigade of Fang Xianjue's 88th Division, the majority of the 184th Regiment, the directly subordinate units of the 140th Brigade Headquarters of the 70th Division, and the entire 29th Regiment and part of the 28th Regiment of that brigade. In addition to killing and wounding more than 2,000 enemy troops, over 7,000 people including 140th Brigade Commander Xie Mengquan and Regiment Commander Zhou Jue were captured. Four mountain guns, six anti-tank guns, twenty-six mortars, more than fifty heavy machine guns, more than two hundred light machine guns, more than one hundred 60mm mortars and grenade launchers, more than 2,500 rifles, and a large number of other military supplies were seized. Currently, the annihilation of the enemy in the cities of Yutai and Jinxiang is still under siege by our army.

[Urgent Dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front, This Newspaper, 6 PM on the 9th] The troops under General Liu Bocheng on the outskirts of Jinxiang have achieved a major victory, killing, wounding, and capturing over 4,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops, including 140th Brigade Commander and below. Chiang Kai-shek's policy of "cutting flesh to heal sores" has once again suffered a devastating blow from the People's Liberation Army. In order to relieve the siege of Jinxiang, Chiang Kai-shek did not hesitate to transfer the 140th Brigade and the 319th Brigade of the 70th Division, which had been transferred from Taiwan from afar, to coordinate with the 62nd Brigade of the 88th Division, under the unified command of Fang Xianjue. They advanced north from Yutai on the 6th and were severely damaged by the Eighth Route Army, with over 400 captured. They fled back in panic, and the Eighth Route Army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, encircling and annihilating them in the areas of Songzhi, Jiangjialou and other places about ten miles northwest of Yutai. From the 8th to noon on the 9th, preliminary results were obtained as follows: in addition to the killed and wounded, over 3,500 people including 140th Brigade Commander Xie Mengquan and Regiment Commander Zhou Jue were captured, four mountain guns, six anti-tank guns, over twenty small cannons, and a large number of light and heavy machine guns and rifles were seized, which are currently being inventoried.

[Another Dispatch] In order to lift the siege of Jinxiang and Yutai, Liu Ruzhen, Mi Wenhe, who were trapped in Heze, and Zhang Lanfeng, who was trapped in Dingtao, under repeated urging from the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, led their remnants east on the 7th, attempting to reoccupy Juye and cut off the rear of the Eighth Route Army besieging Jinxiang and Yutai. The local Eighth Route Army is putting up a strong resistance. (Image attached)
