　　Showing the Good Life and Work in the Liberated Areas
    Yan'an People Joyfully Celebrate the Lunar New Year's Eve
    Wen Jie Dances and Ten Thousand Lights Shine All Night Long
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] Liberated Daily reporter Lin Jian reports: Yan'an bid farewell to the old year amidst the cheers of ten thousand people. On New Year's Eve, amidst the wind and snow, the streets of Yan'an were bustling with people. All companies and shops posted New Year couplets. A rope shop posted a couplet at its entrance that read, "With government support, develop freely; without the oppression of financial groups, operate as you please," fully demonstrating the prosperous atmosphere of commerce in the liberated areas. The reporter went to the home of Mr. Shi Laicheng, an old man in Xinshi Township in the urban area. The family was lighting lamps, gathering, and making dumplings. Mr. Shi's wife, the famous textile heroine and city councilor of the city, Shi Laopo, is now fifty-eight years old. She leads her entire family and will host a banquet on the third day of the new year to entertain the stationed military officers and soldiers. In the past year, she spun seventy catties of yarn and wove sixty or seventy zhang of cloth. All six members of her family, except for the old man, are able to spin and weave. Mr. Zhang Yongtai, a former landlord, said that he will also host a party on the fifth day of the new year to entertain Party and government officials, soldiers, and relatives and friends for a festive gathering. His grandson, Dazhong, said, "In the old society, although my family had a lot of money, we did not live in peace. Now we have both money and happiness." Zhang's door was pasted with the couplet "New ideas and new education create a new society; good health and good labor develop a good family." Zhang said that he did not spend lavishly this year, only making new clothes for his grandson and granddaughter, and only sharing a pig with others. Last year, he made a new set of clothes for everyone and slaughtered a whole pig for the family. This is in response to the government's call for thrift. In the evening, lanterns were hung at the entrances of each house, with various blessings written on them, and some even had Chairman Mao's "Qinyuan Spring" written on them. On the mountains around Yan'an, ten thousand lights illuminated the night. At this time, the news of our army's victory in recovering Zaozhuang and annihilating an enemy division had spread throughout the city, further filling the celebration parties in various institutions with joy. The famous journalist Anna Louise Strong braved the snow to go from the foreign guesthouse to the Xinhua News Agency, the Liberated Daily, and the Central Printing Factory to participate in the parties. She was excited by this jubilation and enthusiastically joined the Yangko dance line. At midnight, nearby stationed troops, the Yan'an City Self-Defense Forces, and some institutional self-defense forces fired guns and set off firecrackers, echoing the sounds of firecrackers from the masses, resounding through the valleys until dawn the next day.

　　显示解放区安居乐业好光景
    延安人民狂欢渡除夕
    闻捷起舞万家灯火达通宵
    【新华社延安二十二日电】解放日报记者林间报导：在万人欢腾中，延安辞别旧岁。除夕风雪中，延安街头人群熙攘，各公司店铺均贴出新年对联，一家绳铺在门首贴着“有政府扶助放手开展；无财阀压迫任意经营”的对联，充分显示出解放区商业的繁荣气象。记者至市区新市乡石来成老先生家，该家正燃灯团聚包饺子，石先生夫人，即本市曾负盛名之市参议员纺织英雄石老婆，今年已五十八岁，她领导她全家，将在初三日设宴招待驻军将士。过去一年她纺线七十斤，织布六七十丈，全家六口人，除老头外，均能纺织。旧日地主张永泰先生说：他亦将于初五日招待党政军及亲朋以资联欢。其孙儿大忠说：“在旧社会我家钱虽多，但过不安宁，现在又有钱又快乐。”张的门首贴着“新思想新教育创造新社会，好体力好劳动发展好人家”。张说他今年过年并不铺张，仅为其孙儿及孙女缝制新衣，只与人合宰一口猪，而去年过年即每人全缝一套新衣，全家一口猪，这是响应政府节约的号召。入晚，各家门首均悬街灯，上写各种祝祠，并有题毛主席“沁园春”者。延安各山头，万家灯火，照耀通宵。是时我军克复枣庄歼敌一师之捷报，已传遍全市，愈使各机关之庆祝晚会充满欢腾。美名记者斯特朗女士冒雪由外宾招待所赶赴新华社、解放日报社及中央印刷厂参加晚会。她被这种欢腾所兴奋，而热情地投入秧歌行列。午夜，附近驻军、延市自卫军及若干机关自卫军，均鸣枪放炮，配合群众之鞭炮声、响彻山谷，迄翌日黎明犹未终止。
