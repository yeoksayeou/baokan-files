    Jinnan Administrative Office Convenes Labor Hero Forum to Discuss Experiences
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 3rd Dispatch] In order to launch this year's large-scale production movement, the Jinnan Administrative Office convened a forum on the eve of the New Year, gathering sixteen labor heroes from Weixian, Guangzong, and Qiu counties to discuss and share mutual aid experiences. At the meeting, Wang Chaogui, a labor hero from Guangzong, spoke first. The Old Shop mutual aid group he led has become widespread throughout the village, with even women and children organized. He endures hardship first and distributes rice later, earning the support of the entire village. Following him, Yang Rongfu, a labor hero from Yangjiatun, Guangzong, introduced his experience in trial planting Japanese wheat. Last year, with the same land, equal fertilizer, and labor, he harvested 160 jin per mu, while Chinese wheat yielded only 40 jin per mu. Japanese wheat has large grains and white flour, and he hopes it can be widely promoted in Jinnan. Shi Chuncai, a labor hero from Shengfotang, Weixian, reported on the grain ticket work point system he created this spring, which overcomes the trouble of bookkeeping. The accounts are clear to the whole group, and everyone is satisfied with the monthly settlement. Regarding preferential treatment for military families, he created a method of mobilizing family members of soldiers with partial labor to cultivate a portion of their land as much as possible. The land they cannot cultivate themselves is distributed among various groups for cultivation or leased, with the harvest from leased land being divided according to a nine-one ratio (military families receive nine, the mutual aid group receives one). Li × An, a labor hero from Li Sheng Village, Qiu County, created a work point system based on labor strength, determining work points based on the size of the group members' labor force, fully mobilizing the productive enthusiasm of the group members. Out of 110 households in the village, 99 participated in mutual aid, and a labor mutual aid society was established to uniformly lead the village's agricultural and sideline production, with labor discipline established and competitions frequently launched. Zhou Jinsheng, a labor hero from Xinxianzhuang, Qiu County, leads six mutual aid groups in the entire village. Under his leadership, all 70 households in the village live above the middle peasant level. Thirty single men in the mutual aid group have all married this year, making mutual aid production even more vigorous. Yuan Zhaocun, a labor hero from Nanliucun, Qiu County, organized the exchange of labor between people and cattle during the spring plowing last year, saving 500 man-days of labor. In addition, he also organized women to exchange labor. The conference held discussions for four days. On the fifth day, group discussions were held on the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, work point recording, and labor exchange. On the sixth day, collective discussions were held, and on the last day, cadres wrote biographies for the labor heroes.

    冀南行署召集劳英座谈经验
    【本报威县三日电】为开展今年大生产运动，冀南行署于新年前夕召集威县、广宗、邱县十六名劳动英雄座谈互助经验。会间首由广宗劳英王朝桂发言，他领导下的旧店互助，已普遍全村，连妇女小孩都组织起来。他吃苦在前，分米在后，得到全村群众拥护。继由广宗杨家屯劳英扬荣辅介绍试种日本小麦的经验。去年他以同样的土地，用相等的肥料和人工，每亩收一百六十斤，种中国小麦每亩仅收四十斤。日本小麦粒大粉白，他希望冀南很好推广。威县圣佛堂劳英石纯才报告他今春创造的粮票记工办法，克服了记账的麻烦，账目全组都明白，每月一结账，大家都很满意。在劳力优抗上，他创造了动员有半劳力之抗属，尽量自耕一部土地，其不能自耕之土地，分散各组代耕或租种，租种之土地收获按九一分粮（抗属得九，互助组得一）。邱县李省庄劳英李×安创造了按分计工的办法，按组员劳力大小确定工分，充分发挥了组员的生产的积极性，全村一百一十户，参加互助者九十九户，并成立了劳动互助社，统一领导全村的农业与副业生产，并定有劳动纪律，经常发动比赛。邱县新鲜庄劳英周进生领导全村六个互助组。在他领导下全村七十户都过着中农以上的生活。互助组里三十个光棍汉今年都娶了老婆，互助生产更加起劲。邱县一区南刘村劳英袁兆村，去年春耕时，组织人牛换工，种麦节省了五百人工。另外，他又组织妇女换工。大会座谈了四天，第五天分组讨论农业与副业结合、记工换工等问题，第六天集体讨论，最后一天干部分头给劳英写传略。
