Preparing to Persist in Guerrilla Warfare
    Longping and Chengci Fifth District Separately Train and Inspect All Militia
    [Report from our Weixian Office, 12th] The Chengci Fifth District Headquarters inspected the entire district's militia on December 27th, preparing to persist in guerrilla warfare and eliminate the Chiang troops. On that day, before breakfast, militia platoons from various villages entered the field, striving to be model units and performing drills in the square. After the meeting, seventy-two people were selected from the entire militia for political and military tests. The military test was divided into two groups: a grenade throwing group of twelve people and a shooting group of twelve people. The results of the political test showed that the Dongchengying platoon performed the best, and the Matou platoon performed the worst. Twelve people scored above eighty points. Wang Xian, Zhu Fengqi, and Huang Cunfu scored one hundred points and were each awarded a towel and a pencil. In grenade throwing, Wang Guangran performed the best, reaching fifty-four meters, and Li Zhenhua threw forty-two meters; nine people received awards. Wang Yuejing performed the best in shooting, hitting seventeen rings with two shots. Everyone praised him, saying, "He is truly a first-class sharpshooter! If the enemy dares to attack, he will surely kill them one by one." Finally, Director Zhang of the Armed Forces Committee called on all militia members to continue their political studies and martial arts training, to develop into a strong people's armed force, to cooperate with the regular army to eliminate the Chiang troops, and to protect the land and ensure a peaceful life.
    [Another report] The Longping Armed Forces Committee gathered village militia captains on December 10th, a total of one hundred and twenty people, to learn techniques such as shooting, grenade throwing, and laying landmines. The trainees studied enthusiastically, and by the 24th, they had mastered the techniques and graduated. The trainees, eager to try their skills, said, "If Old Chiang dares to attack, we will make them die on landmines." On the 25th, it also concentrated on training the county's militia. Now the entire county's militia is full of high confidence in persisting in guerrilla warfare and eliminating the Chiang troops.
