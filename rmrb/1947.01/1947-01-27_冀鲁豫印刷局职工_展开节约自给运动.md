    Employees of the Ji-Lu-Yu Printing Bureau
    Launch a Thrift and Self-Sufficiency Campaign
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch, 25th] The employees of the Ji-Lu-Yu Printing Bureau have launched a thrift and self-sufficiency campaign in response to the Administrative Office’s call for “agencies to achieve production self-sufficiency and individuals to achieve thrift self-sufficiency.” At the end-of-1946 cadre work summary meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the printing bureau itself is a production agency, and that expenses such as food allowances and wages should be achieved through individual thrift to support the front lines and reduce the burden on the people. After the cadres had fully deliberated, they mobilized the various factories to deliberate. On New Year's Day, when Bureau Chief Zhang made a work summary report for 1946 to all employees, he formally conveyed the report of Director Duan of the Administrative Office. Young worker Chen Shuangjin handed his letter to the Secretary-General. His letter read: "Secretary-General, after reading the notice of December 31st, I thought about it. Bureau Chief Zhang and Bureau Chief Liu don't want their allowances, and they don't want their clothing money from January to April. I wondered why? They are revolutionaries, and I am also a revolutionary. Why am I lagging behind? His exemplary action gave my mind a big stimulus. I also don't want my salary from January 1947 onwards, and I will save it for the soldiers at the front and to relieve the disaster-stricken compatriots in the Jiang-occupied areas. I am determined to do this, please approve me.” Immediately afterwards, female worker Comrade Guo Fengying stood up and said: "I will save 1,500 yuan for the public every month. The front lines are desperately shedding blood, and production thrift in the rear is necessary. Saving a little to support the front lines is for the revolution." Lists of comrades voluntarily saving money were sent one after another to the printing bureau's office.

    冀鲁豫印刷局职工
    展开节约自给运动
    【本报冀鲁豫廿五日电】冀鲁豫印刷局职工掀起节约自给运动，以响应行署“机关生产自给、个人节约自给”的号召。在一九四六年底，干部工作总结会上，大家一致认为印刷局本身是生产机关，菜金、工资等项开支应从每个人节约中求得自给，以支援前线，减轻民负。干部酝酿成熟后，即发动各厂酝酿。当元旦日张局长向全体职工作一九四六年工作总结报告时，正式传达了行署段主任的报告。青年工人陈双金把自己写的信交给秘书长，他的信是这样写的：“秘书长我读了十二月卅一日那个通知，心里想了一下，张局长和刘局长的津贴都不要了，一月至四月的衣服钱也不要了，我想他为啥呢？他是革命的，我也是革命的，我为啥落后呢？他这模范行动给我脑子一个大的刺激，我的工资自一九四七年一月起也不要了，省下来给前方战士和救济蒋占区难胞吧。我是决心这样做，请上级批准我吧”。紧接着有女工郭凤英同志起来说：“我每月给公家节约一千五百元，前方拚命流血，后方生产节约是应该的，节约一点支援前线就是为革命。”同志们自动节约的名单纷纷送到印刷局办公室里。
