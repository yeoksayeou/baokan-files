　　To Support the Patriotic Self-Defense War, Defeat Chiang Kai-shek's Offensive, and Overcome Financial Difficulties, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee has called on organs and individuals to engage in production, practice economy, and achieve self-sufficiency to reduce the burden on the people. The District Party Committee organs immediately conducted deliberations and discussions. Everyone believed that individual economy and self-sufficiency is a conscious mass movement, and two tendencies must be overcome: First, the idea that "with the public having difficulties, how much can individual hardship and economy achieve?" This is incorrect. Many small contributions make a large one; everyone's economy will create a solution. Second, prevent disregarding one's actual situation and eagerly reporting a desire for complete self-sufficiency. Although this spirit is good, it will cause trouble later if difficulties arise. We must proceed from reality; save and be self-sufficient as much as possible. As a result of the discussion, some said, "Minor principles (individual difficulties) must be subordinate to major principles (public difficulties), individual economy is to support the self-defense war." Comrades Liu Puchun and Xu Yunbei said, "In response to the call for economy, we will not receive anything for the first half of 1947." The leadership promptly commended them and held a general meeting of all personnel. The next day, a list of 110 individuals' economy and self-sufficiency was sent to the office. It is estimated that more than 160,000 yuan can be saved in the first half of this year. The task of organ production for self-sufficiency in the first half of this year is to completely cover office expenses and food costs. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee organs have over one hundred personnel, and all office expenses and food costs for the first half of the year will be saved by more than 950,000 yuan. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Financial and Economic Office stipulates that in the first half of the year, office, miscellaneous, food, medical, horse feed, repairs, and organ personnel's single-layer clothing, allowances, and shoes will not be collected from the public, totaling a savings of nearly 850,000 yuan. The solution is to have organ production cover 500,000 yuan and to mobilize individual production and economy. Currently, among only fifteen people, six have volunteered not to receive single-layer clothing, allowances, and shoes for the first half of the year, which can save a total of 81,965 yuan. The Administrative Office's production and economy plan is estimated to save 3 million yuan. Among the sixteen administrative staff members of the Public Security Bureau, fourteen are self-sufficient in single-layer clothing, allowances, and shoes. Wang Jinfeng, a fourteen-year-old logistics worker in the Administrative Office, also voluntarily does not receive allowances and shoes for the first half of the year.

　　战胜财经困难迎接光明
  　冀鲁豫区党委号召机关个人生产节约自给
  　行署等机关上半年将节约五百万元
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】冀鲁豫区党委为了支持爱国自卫战争，打垮蒋介石的进攻，克服财经困难，特号召机关与个人生产节约自给，以减轻民负。区党委机关，当即进行了酝酿讨论，大家认为：个人节约自给是自觉的群众运动，须克服两种偏向：一是认为“公家有了困难，光刻苦个人，个人能节约多少呢？”这是不对的想法。集腋成裘，大家都节约就有办法。二是防止不顾自己的实际情况，即报奋勇，要全部自给。这种精神虽好，但以后发生困难就麻烦了，要从实际出发，能节约自给多少就是多少。讨论的结果，有的说：“小道理（个人困难）要服从大道理（公家困难），个人节约是为了支持自卫战争”。刘普春和徐运北同志说：“为响应节约号召，四七年上半年的东西全部不要总了”。领导上及时进行了表扬，并召开了机关全体人员大会，第二天即有一百一十个人的节约自给名单送到办公室。计今年上半年即可节约自给十六万余元。今年上半年的机关生产自给任务是办公费及菜金全部自给。区党委机关人员×百多人，上半年全部办公费和菜金共节约九十五万多元。冀鲁豫财经办事处规定上半年的办公、杂支、菜金、医药、马乾、修理、及机关人员的单衣、津贴、鞋子等完全不向公家领取，总计节约将近八十五万元，其解决办法由机关生产解决五十万元，另外发动个人生产节约。目前仅在十五人中已有六人自愿不领上半年的鞋子、单衣与津贴，共计可节约八万一千九百六十五元。行署机关之生产节约计划，约计为三百万元，公安局干杂人员十六人中即有十四人自给单衣、津贴与鞋子。行署十四岁的勤务员王进峰同志也自动不领上半年的津贴与鞋子。
