    Men from the Fourth District Join the War
    Women Take Charge of Land Distribution
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 23rd] In Fushan's Fourth District, the men joining the war and the women distributing land have created a new form of struggle, and the movement is vigorously developing. The Fourth District's spider-web-style joint defense militia groups besiege Chiang's troops in Fushan day and night. The majority of the villages' women step forward to struggle against the landlords and carry out land reform. They have also created new forms of struggle, which have quickly made the landlords hand over their land. Li Yuti of Qiaobei Village had been struggled against several times, but always stubbornly refused to return things. The women saw through that he would rather die than give up his wealth, so they reasoned with the wife and daughters of the Li family's landlord, pursuing each of their individual crimes one by one, and finally got all the things back. At the same time, when struggling against the Li family's landlord, they made the Zhang family's landlord stand next to them, influencing the Zhang family's landlord to automatically hand over the land during the liquidation. After the victory in Qiaobei's struggle, all the women held a celebration meeting and wrote a letter to the men at the front: "We have become the masters, reclaiming our own land through struggle. You must be even more heroic in defending the fruits of victory."
    After the women of the Fourth District participated in the struggle, they also changed the old work style of the cadres. In the past, the cadres' practice of doing everything themselves and issuing unquestionable orders was something the women couldn't stand. Before the struggle, they first held a joint meeting with the cadres, explaining that women are different from men, and that the cadres' leadership style should be more open. After the struggle, when distributing the fruits, they held a celebration party with the cadres. Everyone said to the cadres that they couldn't follow the old methods, but had to distribute things after everyone had discussed and made a decision. After the meeting, many cadres thought to themselves that the women's methods were better than their own, and that they should learn from them. The Peasant Association of Beiqiao Village requested that women be added as cadres in the Peasant Association, changing the old notion that men were in charge and women didn't count.

    四区男人参战
    妇女担任分田
    【本报太岳二十三日电】浮山四区男人参战妇女分田，创造了新的斗争方式，运动蓬勃发展。四区蛛网联防的民兵集团日夜围困浮山蒋军，多数村子的妇女便挺身与地主斗争，进行土地改革，她们并创造了新的斗争方式，使地主很快的拿出土地。桥北村李雨倜曾经斗争过数次，始终抵赖不退东西，妇女们看透了他是舍命不舍财，便和李家地主的妻女进行讲理，从其个别罪恶一一追究，最后将所有的东西全部退出了。同时斗争李家地主时，让张家地主站在旁边，影响张家地主在清算时自动拿出土地来。桥北斗争胜利后，全体妇女召开庆祝大会并写信告诉前方的男人：“我们已当了主人，从斗争中收回自己的土地，你们要更英勇的保卫果实。”
    四区妇女参加斗争后并改变了干部的旧作风，过去干部的包办代替，说一不二的命令方式，妇女们看不惯，在斗争前首先与干部开联席会，说明妇女同男人不一样，干部领导的方式要开放些，斗争后分配果实时，又与干部开联欢会，大家向干部说，不能按过去的老办法，必须经过大家议决后才能分配，会后许多干部自想妇女的办法比自己的还多，要向他们学习。北桥村的农会要求妇女增选农会干部，改变了过去男人当家妇女不算人的旧观念。
