    Democratic Government Distributes Grain and Clothing to Relieve the People of Yüncheng
    [Our newspaper from the border region of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, 7th of this month] After the recovery of Yüncheng, the democratic government quickly entered the city to stabilize social order and relieve the afflicted people. Many people in the city were brutally murdered, leaving their families without a means of living. Liu Xiaoyi supported his family by doing small business. After he was brutally murdered, he left behind a seventy-year-old father and four children, none of whom had the ability to work or land, and they were about to starve. Zhang Xidian and Zhang Xiwu, two brothers, also lived by doing small business. After the two brothers were brutally murdered together, they left behind more than ten family members, both old and young, and their lives became a problem. Liu Peiming was brutally murdered, and his wife was also subjected to brutal torture and held for more than twenty days. She was only released after our army liberated the city, but all the belongings in her home had been looted. Under these circumstances, the democratic district office promptly implemented temporary relief measures, first buying coffins and distributing them to the victims' families for burial; at the same time, it also implemented livelihood relief, giving Liu Peiming's father 220 catties of grain, and giving Zhang Xidian's family 400 catties of grain, cotton quilts, cotton-padded jackets, and cotton pants for the children. When the administrative office, the Joint Federation of Trade Unions, and the county government's慰问团 (comfort group) visited the homes of the victims, the victims expressed great gratitude for the democratic government's concern, and they asked the democratic government to help them avenge their grievances.
