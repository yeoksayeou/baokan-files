　　【Taiyue, January 13th dispatch from this newspaper】 Jincheng is universally carrying out the work of cutting off feudal remnants and filling loopholes, striving to realize "land to the tiller" throughout the county by the end of the lunar year. Currently, all county and district cadres are going deep into the villages to lead the masses in their final turn over. Based on the overall situation in the county, villages are generally divided into two types for separate implementation. The first type includes villages where feudal forces have been defeated and most peasants have already turned over, such as Weiding and Changzhuang. The main task here is to cut off feudal remnants, fill loopholes, and compensate for the losses of middle peasants during the major movement. The second type includes villages where the masses have been mobilized and the movement is developing vigorously. A general reckoning and complete liberation are needed to achieve "land to the tiller," such as Zhoucun Zhide and other villages. In the general distribution of fruits, the Sixth District proposed eight considerations: 1. The quality of the land. 2. The distance of the land. 3. The size of the population. 4. The amount of labor. 5. Taking care of military and cadre dependents. 6. Taking care of honorary soldiers and demobilized soldiers. 7. Rich villages taking care of poor villages. 8. Taking care of middle peasants without good land.
