　　The Assembly Sends a Telegram to the Entire Nation Exposing the Collusion between Chiang Kai-shek and the US, and Their Conspiracy to Enslave the Chinese People

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Border Region's Commemorative Assembly for the Anniversary of the Political Consultative Conference and the Ceasefire Order has sent a telegram denouncing the collusion between Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialists to enslave the Chinese people, as well as the atrocities of the American troops. The original telegram is as follows:

To Chairman Mao in Yan'an, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Chairman Zhang Lan of the China Democratic League in Shanghai, all newspaper offices and organizations throughout the country, all army, division, and brigade commanders, and overseas Chinese compatriots:

A year ago today, the ceasefire order was issued, and the Political Consultative Conference was convened. The people of the whole country expressed great joy for this achievement of their struggle! However, with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek internally and the American imperialists externally, they were unwilling for China to truly achieve independence, peace, and democracy. They colluded with each other, acting as accomplices. The ink of the Double Tenth Agreement was not yet dry, and the "Bandit Suppression Manual" had already been issued. The Four Promises were still there, but the sounds of beatings rang out in Jiaochangkou and Cangbaitang. General Li Zhaolin, a hero of the Northeast Resistance against Japan, was killed first, and then Mr. Li and Mr. Wen of the Democratic League were brutally murdered. They first launched an encirclement and annihilation campaign against our Central Plains troops, and then beat Mr. Ma Xulun and other petitioning representatives in Shanghai, and then stabbed labor representative Zhu Xuefan. This series of crimes of destroying and persecuting the people are too numerous to count. All the way to July, the US-Chiang alliance launched a large-scale offensive against our liberated areas, launching an unprecedented civil war. For their military purposes, they even broke faith and righteousness, digging up the river and blocking the mouth, drowning seven million of our compatriots in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. Everyone sees very clearly: the traitor Chiang Kai-shek relies on American aid, and his ferocious flames are high; the United States uses the traitor Chiang Kai-shek as a puppet emperor to implement its colonial policy. Therefore, on the one hand, there is Chiang Kai-shek's massive betrayal of the country, with the so-called Sino-US Commercial Treaty and Navigation Agreement becoming more and more rampant; on the other hand, there are American acts of aggression, with the dumping of American goods and the atrocities of American troops escalating. Even recently, American troops openly raped a Peking University female student in our ancient capital. Even the Japanese invaders did not dare to be so bold and reckless, but the United States brazenly did it. Every Chinese who is unwilling to be a slave cannot tolerate this humiliation, but the Chiang Kai-shek government defends it in every possible way, trying its best to exonerate it. Wang Jingwei's shamelessness is no more than this! Today, as we commemorate the first anniversary of the convening of the Political Consultative Conference and the issuance of the ceasefire order, we would like to express our support for the patriotic movement of students in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places on behalf of the 30 million people in the entire border region. We express our firm opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, dictatorship, civil war, and the American troops' aggression and atrocities against China. Now the whole country, the whole world, and even the people in the United States have risen up to oppose American imperialism, and the American-equipped Chiang army has been wiped out by the people in more than fifty brigades. We firmly believe that victory belongs to the people. The military positions of January 13th last year must be restored, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be realized. We must fight to the end to finally achieve the independence, democracy, and peace of the entire China!

　　大会通电全国各界揭露蒋美狼狈为奸
    【本报特讯】边区纪念政治协商会议及停战令周年大会通电，痛斥蒋美勾结奴役中国人民及美军暴行，原电如次：
    延安毛主席、朱总司令、上海民盟张澜主席、全国各报社、各团体、各部队军师旅长暨海外侨胞均鉴：
    去年今日，停战令颁布，政治协商会议召开，全国人民为自己这一奋斗成果，极表欢欣！然而内有蒋贼，外有美帝国主义，不愿意中国真正获得独立和平民主，互相勾结，狼狈为奸。双十会议之墨迹未干，而剿共手册已下；四项诺言犹在，较场口、沧白堂打声四起。东北抗日英雄李兆麟将军被杀于前，民主同盟李、闻先生惨死于后，既发动围歼我中原部队，后殴打上海马叙伦先生等请愿代表，又刺伤劳工代表朱学范，这一连串摧残迫害人民的罪行，是多不胜数。一直到七月，美蒋结合向我解放区大举进攻，发动古今中外空前未有的大内战，为其军事目的，甚至背信弃义掘河堵口淹我冀鲁豫七百万同胞。大家看得很清楚：蒋贼恃美国帮助，凶焰高涨，美国利用蒋贼做儿皇帝，以贯彻其殖民地政策。因此，一方面是蒋贼的大卖国，所谓中美商约航海协定，越卖越凶；另一方面，是美国侵略行为，随着美货倾销，美军暴行愈演愈烈，甚至最近美军公然在我国故都强奸北大女生，即日寇也不敢大胆妄为之事，美国竟悍然为之。只要是不愿意做奴隶的每个中国人，都不能忍受这种污辱，而蒋记政府反为之百般辩护，尽力开脱，汪精卫之无耻不过如此！今天我们纪念政协召开与停战令颁发一周年，谨代表全边区三千万人民，对于平津京沪等地学生爱国运动表示声援。对于蒋介石之卖国、独裁、内战，与美军侵华暴行表示坚决反对，现在全国全世界以及美国国内人民都已经起来反对美国帝国主义，而美装蒋军已被人民消灭五十多旅，我们坚决相信，胜利是属于人民的。去年一月十三号军事位置必须恢复，政协决议必要实现，我们要为最后实现全中国独立、民主、和平而奋斗到底！
   晋冀鲁豫边区政治协商会议及停战令周年纪念大会  万人同叩
