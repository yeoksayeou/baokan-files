　　Taihang's Experience in Distributing the Fruits of Struggle
    Recently, various regions in Taihang have provided the following new experiences in the fair and reasonable distribution of the fruits of struggle during the land reform review:
    I. It is essential to resolve the ideological issues of cadres and the masses before distribution, ensuring they accept the principle of filling the gaps and making up for deficiencies. The following ideas are commonly found: 1. Cadres and activists believe they have contributed more and want to receive a larger or better share. 2. Among the masses, those who have suffered more want a larger share. 3. Some advocate for equal distribution. 4. Cadres and activists, fearing trouble and offending people, are irresponsible and let the masses do as they please. 5. The village is unwilling to share with other villages, and locals are unwilling to share with newcomers. Solutions: After mobilizing activists and appraisers in Taizhuang Village, She County, to reflect on their actions, the leadership raised questions for everyone to discuss, such as: "Cadres want the best, and the masses also want the best. What if there are not enough good things? Isn't being irresponsible because you fear trouble just another way to offend people?" After repeated discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that everyone wants more and better things, but that relying solely on individual desires is impossible. It must be discussed by the masses, and cadres should not be special. As long as there is broad discussion with the masses, no one will be offended. Fear and perfunctory actions are the only things that will cause offense. After the cadres' thinking was straightened out, the ideological problems of the masses were resolved in the winter school. Poor peasant Wei Hejin said, "I raised the issue of clothing for landlord Wei Qi, and I want a larger share of the clothes." Some of the masses also advocated that whoever raised more complaints should receive a larger share. Someone immediately pointed out, "Think about how the fruits came to be. The struggle was done by everyone, and the fruits should be shared by everyone." After everyone debated, they finally agreed that distribution should be based on what each person lacks. After jointly overthrowing the local tyrant in Xiwu Village, Licheng County, and twelve other small villages, the masses in Xiwu Village developed the idea of not wanting to share things with people from other villages. The village cadres immediately pointed out, "Everyone suffered oppression in the past, and today everyone gets the fruits." After discussion among the masses, village egoism was broken down. The thirty-six new households of migrants who had just moved from the mountains were initially not wanted to be given a share. After discussing "Poor people all over the world are one family", everyone's awareness was raised, and they all said, "Let the migrant families settle down first."
    II. With clear principles, specific slogans, and democratic discussion, appropriate distribution is guaranteed. For example, Beiguan, She County, proposed: "Fill the gaps for the poorest, make up for deficiencies for the poor peasants, and take care of the middle peasants." Zhuning, Zuoquan County, proposed: "Fill the big holes, patch the small holes, and take care of the three holes." The specific steps are generally as follows: 1. Establish an appraisal committee elected by the masses. If it is a joint struggle, it should be elected by the masses in each village (such as in Xiwu Village, Licheng County). 2. The appraisal committee investigates the situation of each household. 3. The masses discuss in groups who should fill what gaps and how much. Each person makes a proposal, which is passed by the group and submitted to the appraisal committee. 4. Based on the investigation and the opinions of each group, the appraisal committee divides the households into grades, assesses what each household should receive, posts it for public review, and sets up a suggestion box to widely solicit opinions from the masses before re-evaluating. 5. A mass meeting is convened to announce the results of the re-evaluation. After further discussion and revision by everyone, it is considered the final decision. Then, the appraisal committee distributes to each household.
    III. Several issues in the distribution of fruits: 1. In addition to discussing with the masses and dividing them into grades based on family circumstances, military dependents and honorably discharged soldiers should be given preferential treatment during distribution. For example, "Priority to military dependents and honorably discharged" in Dongshu Village, Lincheng County; "Military dependents and honorably discharged raised by one grade" in Beiguan Village, She County; "Good land, fertile land, and livestock should be given to poor military dependents and honorably discharged soldiers first" in Xiwu Village, Licheng County, are all good methods. 2. The principle for the fruits of joint struggle should be: everyone who participates in the struggle shares in the fruits. The village (where the landlord is located) distributes land and houses, while the other villages distribute grain and clothing." For example, when Xiwu Village in Licheng County and its nearby twelve small villages distributed the fruits, they uniformly divided the households in each village into grades based on poverty and wealth, assessed scores, priced the fruits, and then distributed them. The masses in each village were very satisfied.

    Neiqiu has gained several points of experience in distributing the fruits of struggle. In addition to distributing what is lacking, filling the gaps and making up for deficiencies, and democratic discussion by the masses, the following three points should also be noted: 1. Mass transportation and centralization. The fruits must be centralized for unified distribution. When centralizing, the masses should be mobilized to transport them, with men, women, young, and old all participating. This can both mobilize and educate the masses, making them realize that the fruits are their own blood and sweat and have been recovered through arduous struggle, inspiring their enthusiasm for protecting the fruits. It can also avoid feudal forces from resenting a few cadres and activists. This is also a demonstration of the power of the masses. In villages that have done this, the masses speak very commonly and enthusiastically when discussing the distribution of fruits, and the distribution is fair and reasonable. 2. After the land issue is resolved, farmers urgently demand production tools and livestock. Therefore, the silver dollars, gold, and silver that are seized should be used to buy livestock and farm implements for unified filling of gaps and making up for deficiencies. North Street in the city bought twenty heads, and Dameng Village bought sixteen heads, reaching at least one head of livestock for every four families. Winter production can be carried out immediately, laying the foundation for the large-scale production movement next year. This can both overcome the past phenomenon of the masses wasting the fruits and reduce disputes during the distribution of fruits. 3. Take care of the middle peasants, tenant farmers, and poor peasants. After the single men turned over, they urgently demanded marriage. In Dameng Village, a single man counted as two to two and a half people. In addition to taking care of the lonely, widowed, and elderly, they should also take care of honest and silent masses, solicit their opinions more, and let them participate in the distribution.

　　太行分果实经验
    太行各地最近在翻身大检查中，对于公平合理的分配斗争果实，提供了以下新的经验。
    一、分配前必先解决干部与群众的思想问题，使其接受填平补齐方针。普遍发现有以下几种思想：１、干部积极分子认为出力大，想多分与分好的。２、群众中诉苦多的想多分。３、也有人主张平均分。４、干部与积极分子怕麻烦、怕惹人，因此不负责，让群众自流。５、本村不愿给外村分，本地人不愿给外来户分。解决办法：涉县台庄村在发动积极分子与评议员反省后，领导上提出：“干部想分好的，群众也想分好的，好东西少怎么办？怕麻烦不负责是不是就是惹人？”等问题让大家讨论。经再三讨论，大家一致认为：要多要好之心谁都有，光由各人心思办不到，必须群众讨论，干部不应特别。只要广泛与群众讨论，就惹不下人，害怕、虚应差事非惹人不行。干部思想打通后，即在冬学里解决群众的思想问题。贫农魏河金说：“俺给地主魏齐提的是衣服问题，俺要多分衣服。”部分群众也主张谁提意见多谁多分。当场便有人提出：“想想果实是怎样来的？斗争是大家干，果实应大家得。”经过大家辩论，最后一致同意，应按缺什补什的办法分。黎城西仵村与十二个小村联合斗倒恶霸后，西仵群众即产生了不愿分东西给外村人的思想。村干部当即提出：“过去大家受压迫，今天大家得果实。”群众讨论后，便打破了村本位主义。该村新从山里移来的三十六户客民，起初不愿给他们分，后经讨论了“天下穷人是一家”，大家觉悟提高了，都说：“先叫客民们安了家”。
    二、方针明确，口号具体，民主讨论，便一定会分配恰当。如涉县北关提出：“赤贫填平，贫农补齐，中农照顾。”左权竹宁提出：“填起大洞，补平小洞，照顾三洞。”具体进行中一般有以下几个步骤：一、成立评议会由群众选举，如系联合斗争，则应由各村群众选（如黎城西仵）。二、评议会调查各户情况。三、群众以小组讨论谁该填什么，填多少，先由各人提出，小组通过，写出名单交评议会。四、评议会根据调查与各组意见，挨户划分等级，评出各户应得东西，榜示群众，并设民意箱，广泛征求群众意见，再行复评。五、召开群众大会，宣布复评结果，再经大家讨论修改通过，即算最后决定。然后由评议会逐户分配。
    三、果实分配中的几个问题：一、军属、荣退军人除了与群众一块讨论，按家景划分等级外，分配时还应加以优待。如临城东竖村“先尽军属、荣退”；涉县北关“军属、荣退提高一等”；黎城西仵“近地、好地、牲口要尽先放到贫苦军属与荣退军人身上”都是很好的办法。二、联合斗争的果实，原则上应是：大家斗争大家分。本村（地主所在村）分土地房屋，外村分粮食衣物”。如黎城西仵与其附近十二个小村分果实时，即是按各户各村穷富统一划分等级，评定分数，再把果实作价，然后分配，各村群众都很满意。
    内邱在分配斗争果实中，获得几点经验，除缺啥分啥，填平补齐及群众民主讨论外，还应注意以下三点：一、群众性的搬运集中。果实须集中统一分配，集中时，应发动群众搬运，男女老少一齐下手。这样既能发动群众又能教育群众，使群众认识到果实是自己的血汗是经过艰苦斗争才收回来的，激发其保卫果实之热情。也能避免封建势力仇视少数干部、积极分子，这也是群众力量的示威。凡是这样作的村庄，讨论分配果实时，群众发言即很普遍、热烈，分配亦公平合理。二、土地问题解决后，农民即迫切要求生产工具与牲口，因之应将斗出的现洋、金、银等买成牲口和农具，统一填平补齐。城内北街就买了二十头，大孟村买了十六头，达到至少四家伙有一头牲口。马上可进行冬季生产，并为明年大生产运动打下基础。这既能克服过去群众浪费果实现象，又可减少分果实时的争执。三、照顾中、佃、贫，光棍汉翻身后迫切的婚姻要求，大孟村光棍汉一口人顶两口人至两个半人。其次照顾孤寡老年外，还照顾老实不吭气群众，多征求他们的意见，并让他们参加分配。
