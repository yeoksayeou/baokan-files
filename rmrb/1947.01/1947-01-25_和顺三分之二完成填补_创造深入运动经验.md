　　Harmony Completes Two-Thirds of Filling-in
    Creating In-depth Movement Experience
    [This newspaper, Changzhi News] The Harmony County Party Committee, Li Xiuren, reports: Two-thirds of the villages in the county have completed the filling-in process and are now undergoing consolidation work. Comrade Li pointed out: According to the experience gained, it has been proven that there are many differences between the in-depth stage of the mass movement and the large-scale mobilization stage, and the old methods must be broken in practice to face the following new problems: First, in order to maintain their feudal rule, the landlord class has exhausted all means to protect themselves in the mass movement. They either disguise themselves as revolutionaries and steal village political power (mostly in charge of finances, food, education, secretaries, etc.), confuse the targets of struggle, and conceal their property; or infiltrate peasant associations and advocate equal distribution when distributing fruits (because landlords generally have large families and can get more); or use their daughters and daughters-in-law to soften village cadres; or use religious and secret societies to fool the masses; or use family divisions to change their status. The most vicious thing is to pretend to be enlightened and offer a small amount of land to escape thorough liquidation. Therefore, the in-depth stage must continue to conduct in-depth inspections and thoroughly eliminate feudalism. Second, problems within the peasantry. The first is the contradiction between advanced elements and backward masses. During the large-scale movement, backward masses expressed negativity due to ideological concerns, and active elements looked down on them. Therefore, when distributing fruits, active elements got more and they were given very little, and contradictions arose. Our solution to these problems is to open up the minds of advanced elements, make them withdraw from the extra fruits, and conduct self-criticism to the backward masses; for backward elements, we first let them express their grievances thoroughly, then resolve their ideological concerns, and finally achieve great unity between advanced and backward elements. Secondly, in some backward areas, feudal forces mostly steal leadership, so it is necessary to directly mobilize the masses. There is also a type of area in the old liberated areas, where cadres are all middle peasants. These people played a significant role during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but they have shown themselves to be weak or even an obstacle in land reform. Here, it is necessary to deeply mobilize poor and hired peasants, adjust cadres, and establish poor and hired peasant backbones. As for stabilizing the emotions of middle peasants, it is not only an important issue for uniting the peasants, but also greatly dispels the ideological concerns of poor peasants about getting rich. Third, the economic turn-around of the masses does not mean that they are ideologically aware. For example, why are the poor poor, why are the landlords rich, whose land is it, why couldn't they turn over in the past, by what right did the landlords rule the peasants, will the landlords counterattack in the future, what will we use to defend our fruits, who did we work for in the past, who will we work for in the future, is it still necessary to struggle against those who start a business through labor, etc., are not conscious enough. Therefore, after we completely complete the filling-in, we immediately launched a systematic ideological education movement. In practice, we adopted the method of: taking the base point village as a unit, universally training peasants, with 30 to 70 people being trained in each village per session, with a plan to train 24,000 people in three sessions. Initial experience has proven that this is fast and direct, and the contradiction between large areas and few district cadres has also been resolved. After the masses' awareness is raised, cadres can also be supervised and transformed. Fourth, incentivize landlords to produce. After the landlords have thoroughly compensated the masses, they should be shown a bright future, which is labor production. For example, after the landlord Li Sanhai compensated the masses for their blood and sweat last spring, his whole family devoted themselves to production, increased wasteland reclamation, and harvested 60 *shi* of grain last autumn, and also bought two large donkeys. Now he is still living the life of a prosperous middle peasant. Now Harmony is launching the Li Sanhai movement throughout the county.

　　和顺三分之二完成填补
    创造深入运动经验
    【本报长治讯】和顺县委李修仁报导：该县三分之二村庄已经完成填补，现正进行巩固工作。李同志提出：根据已获经验，证明群运进入深入阶段与大发动阶段是有许多不同的，作法上必须打破老一套，面对以下几个新的问题：第一、地主阶级为了保持其封建统治，在大运动中用尽一切办法掩护自己。或伪装革命面貌，窃持村政权（多系财粮、义教、书记等）错乱斗争目标，掩盖自己财产；或打入农会，在分果实时主张平均分配（因一般地主家人多，可多分）；或利用其闺女媳妇软化村干部；或利用宗教、会门等迷信团体愚弄群众；或用分家来转变成份，最毒辣的是假开明献出少部田产，逃避彻底清算，所以深入阶段必须继续深入检查、彻底肃清封建。第二、农民内部问题。首先是先进分子与落后群众的矛盾，大运动中落后群众由于思想顾虑多，表示消极，积极分子就对他们轻视起来，故分果实时，积极分子多分，给他们分的很少，矛盾因而产生。我们解决这些问题的办法是：打通先进分子思想，使其退出多分果实，并向落后群众检讨；对落后分子是先让其发透怨言，然后解决其思想顾虑，最后达到先进与落后分子大团结。其次，在一些落后地区，多半是封建势力窃持领导，故必须直接发动群众。在老区还有一种地区，干部都是中农，这些人抗战中起过不小作用，但在土地改革中却表示无力，甚至成为障碍。在这里必须深入发动贫雇农，调整干部，树立贫雇骨干。至于安定中农情绪，不仅是团结农民的重要问题，且大大解除了贫农发家的思想顾虑。第三、群众经济上翻身后，还不等于思想上就已觉悟，如穷人为什穷、地主什富、地是谁的、过去为什不能翻身，地主凭什么统治农民，今后地主是否还会反攻，我们用什么来保卫果实，过去为谁劳动，今后为谁劳动，劳动起家是否还要斗等问题，都不够自觉。因此，我们在填补彻底完成后，即展开了一个系统的思想教育运动，做法上采取了：以基点村为单位，普训农民，每村一期受训的三十至七十人，计划三期要训练二万四千人。初期经验证明这样既快、又直接，地方大，区干部少的矛盾也得到解决。群众觉悟提高后，干部也可得到监督与改造。第四、激励地主生产。地主彻底赔偿群众后，应当给他们指出了一个光明前途，即劳动生产，如地主李三孩去春赔偿群众血汗果实后，全家致力生产，增开荒地，去秋打粮六十石，又卖下两头大驴，现在仍过着富裕中农的生活。现和顺在全县范围内，正开展着李三孩运动。
