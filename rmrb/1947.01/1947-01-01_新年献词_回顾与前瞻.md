　　New Year's Message
    Review and Prospect
    Bo Yibo
    The year 1947 has arrived, and the overall war situation has entered a period of unprecedented tension and significant transformation. The bright days are drawing closer. On this New Year's occasion, we will review the past year and welcome new battles and the execution of new historical tasks.
    In early 1946, due to the decisions of the Moscow Conference of the Three Powers, the strength of our party, our determination to achieve peace, the unyielding and resolute self-defense struggle of the liberated area's military and civilians for four months, as well as the national opposition to civil war and dictatorship and the internal difficulties of the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to sign a ceasefire order and raise his hand in favor of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolutions. This historical achievement allowed the Chinese people to win six months of peace, which, although temporary, was still beneficial to the people's democratic cause. It remains a glorious charter for the Chinese people's struggle for democracy. This is a great victory for the Chinese people and cannot be erased because Chiang Kai-shek later tore it up.
    American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek showed great fear and trembling at this victory of the people. They immediately united to undermine this agreement. At the time, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu military and civilians had misjudged the sincerity of the United States in mediating China's internal strife and implementing peace, and overestimated Chiang Kai-shek's commitment to peace and democracy. We were very honest in complying with the ceasefire agreement. Our Taiyue troops had entered Quwo County and then automatically withdrew; in the vast border areas, we had repeatedly yielded to the Chiang army's attacks, losing more than 1,400 villages, and we never crossed the border to counterattack. We had followed the troop reorganization plan for troop reduction and demobilization, with troop replenishment halted and plans made for demobilization and transfer. In the work of the military mediation executive groups, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu individual groups and representatives had made unilateral concessions for the sake of peace, agreeing to the Kuomintang building railways and highways, opening corridors, withdrawing troops within five miles on both sides of the railway, and so on. These were once for the sake of striving for peace, but unfortunately, the Kuomintang still thought it was not enough, and turned our sincerity for peace into peaceful illusions. Compared with Chiang Kai-shek's active arrangements to attack the liberated areas during this period, we were too foolish and naive on some issues. Little did we know that the American reactionaries had inherited Hitler's mantle, attempting to complete a new world domination. It is the most reactionary aggressor in the world in the 1950s. Marshall's mission to China was to carry out the policies of the American aggressors, setting up a huge deception. Marshall was the deceiver in this deception. He planned a delaying tactic for Chiang Kai-shek in order to buy time to mobilize and organize forces to carry out the bloodiest massacre against the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the Chinese people, a traitor to the Great Revolution and Sun Yat-sen. He launched the April 12th massacre and carried out a ten-year anti-people civil war! During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism, wholeheartedly wanting to maintain his fascist one-party, one-man dictatorship. He wanted to forever maintain the enslavement and whipping of the Chinese people by the four major families. He admitted that the ceasefire order and the PCC resolutions were forced and fake. He waved the banner of peace and democracy with one hand, deceiving the people, while with the other hand, he actively arranged an unprecedented civil war. In this year of tense and complex days, the Chinese people, especially the military and civilians in the liberated areas, received profound lessons and were given two major lessons that the military and civilians in the liberated areas will never forget.
    The large-scale civil war arranged by Chiang and the US broke out in June. Chiang Kai-shek concentrated nearly fifty brigades of troops and launched an offensive against our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu liberated area along three fronts. Our entire region's military and civilians, under the Central Committee of our Party's policy of concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one, not focusing on the gain or loss of one city or one place, but on the annihilation of the enemy's living forces through mobile warfare, began a nationwide patriotic self-defense war. In the six months of self-defense war, with the close cooperation of rear work and front work, local work and military work, land reform and self-defense war, and in the close coordination of mobile warfare and extensive guerrilla warfare, we won the initial victory of the self-defense war. In just these six months, we annihilated sixteen brigades of Chiang's puppet regular troops, totaling 110,000 people. And not a single battalion of our army has been wiped out. We are becoming stronger and stronger in battle, and we are becoming more proficient in applying Chairman Mao's strategic guiding principles, and we have a more thorough understanding of the situation of the US-Chiang reactionaries. Therefore, we have more confidence in crushing the US-Chiang offensive and defending the fruits of the people's struggle.
    Another major event worth recalling in 1946 was the basic completion of land reform. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the peasants had reached out three times to demand the realization of "land to the tiller," but we did not approve it. After the counteroffensive, the peasants re-submitted this request, and our Party agreed and rose up to lead all the peasants in implementing "land to the tiller." In the past year, our entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area has basically completed land reform, with 6.5 million poor and hired peasants having been allocated 18 million mu of land, and 20 million peasants have been liberated from feudal exploitation. Sixty percent of them have joined farmers' associations, and 100,000 young and middle-aged men have joined the front line of the self-defense war. Land reform is still ongoing. Although there are still a few people who think this is an excessive action, whispering behind their backs, their views are outdated and decadent. The Party's policy will never change, and we will never relax it slightly due to war or any other circumstances, but must implement it to the end so that 30 million people can be completely liberated before the spring plowing in 1947.
    1947 has arrived amidst the sound of full-scale artillery fire, bringing us new and more arduous tasks. According to the specific situation of our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, we will focus on carrying out the self-defense war, launching a large-scale production movement, and cultural and educational work.
    American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek autocrat will inevitably mobilize all their reactionary forces to continue to make a desperate and extremely brutal offensive against the Chinese people. Our entire region's Party, government, military, and civilians must concentrate all their efforts and continue to carry out the patriotic self-defense war with tension. All combat corps, guerrilla teams, armed work teams, and people's armed forces must more humbly study and research Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and become proficient in his operational guiding principles. The army must continue to implement Chairman Mao's mass line, fight well, train well, and do a good job in mass work. The rear must ensure a continuous supply of soldiers, ammunition, grain, clothing, etc., and perfect medical rescue work. The front and rear must unite to continue to annihilate the second and third sixteen brigades of Chiang's army. We have full confidence in victory, and we are getting closer and closer to victory, but we also have great difficulties. One-fifth of our region is temporarily occupied by Chiang's army and turned into a guerrilla zone. We must persist in the guerrilla war in these areas, which is of great importance to coordinating with the regular army to recover the lost territory in the future.
    After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and one year of self-defense war, the national economy has been exhausted and financial and economic difficulties exist. We should develop production, promote thrift and scientific calculation, and strive to overcome this difficulty. In addition, after the completion of land reform, the masses are also eager to build their homes, start their businesses, and get rich. Therefore, this year the entire region must launch a large-scale production movement, work hard to produce, and ensure military and civilian needs. Party, government, and people's personnel at all levels must dedicate 90% of their efforts to organize and lead production, universally achieve "cultivating three and having a surplus of one," universally develop cooperatives, universally develop agriculture, household sideline occupations, small handicrafts, handicraft workshops, transportation businesses, and the textile industry, in order to strive to achieve self-sufficiency.
    After land reform, the people will inevitably demand education, improve their culture, pay attention to hygiene, etc. Therefore, after the peasants have turned themselves over, the entire region should universally carry out a "turnover education" and universally carry out national education to popularize and improve the cultural and health levels of the people in the liberated areas.
    The world is moving towards democracy, China is moving towards democracy, and the overall situation is favorable to us. Strive for hard work and struggle, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, under the banner of Mao Zedong, to overcome this difficult road, the light will come, and victory must be ours. This is our review and prospect.

　　新年献词
    回顾与前瞻
    薄一波
    一九四七年已经来临，整个战局亦已进入空前紧张和重大转变关头，光明的日子日益接近，我们特于此新岁之际，将过去一年加以回顾，并迎接新的战斗和执行新的历史任务。
    一九四六年初，由于三国莫斯科会议的决定，我党力量强大及其实现和平的决心，解放区军民四个月的不屈不挠的坚决自卫斗争，以及全国人民反对内战反对独裁和国民党内部的困难重重等原因之下，迫使蒋介石签订了停战命令和举手赞成了政协决议，这一历史的成就，使中国人民赢得了六个月的和平，虽然是暂时的，但对于人民民主事业仍是有利的，至今仍为中国人民民主奋斗的辉煌宪章，这是中国人民的伟大胜利，不能因为后来蒋介石把它撕毁，而加以抹杀。
    美帝国主义及蒋介石对人民这一胜利表示了巨大的恐惧和战栗，他们立即联合起来破坏这一协议，当时我们晋冀鲁豫军民对美国调解中国的内争，实行和平的诚意，估计是有错误的，对蒋介石实行和平民主的估计也高了些，我们曾经是很老实的遵守停战协定，我太岳部队已攻入曲沃县城旋即自动退出；在广大边沿地区对蒋军进攻曾再四忍让，失去了一千四百多个村庄，而我们始终未越界反击；我们曾遵照整军方案进行整军复员，部队停止补充，规划复员转业。在军事调处的执行小组工作中，我们晋冀鲁豫的个别小组和代表曾经为了和平单方的让步过，同意国民党修筑铁路公路，开辟走廊，撤退铁路两侧五里以内之驻军等等。这些曾经是为了争取和平，但可惜这些国民党犹以为未足，把我们的和平诚意，变成了和平幻想。若与蒋介石在这一期间积极布置向解放区进攻相对照，则我们在某些问题上太傻瓜，太天真了。殊不知美国反动派已继承希特勒的衣钵，企图完成新的世界统治，它是廿世纪五十年代世界上最反动的侵略者，马歇尔出使中国就是执行美国侵略者的政策，布置了一个最大的骗局，而马歇尔则是这一骗局中的骗子手，他为蒋介石规划缓兵之计，以便争取时间调动与组织力量，向中国人民进行最血腥的屠杀。蒋介石是中国人民的公敌，大革命和孙中山的叛徒，他发动过四一二大屠杀，进行过十年反人民内战！抗战期间是消极抗战，积极反共，一心一意要维持其法西斯一党一人独裁，他想永远保持四大家族对中国人民的奴役与鞭笞。他承认停战令和政协决议是被迫的假的，他一只手摇着和平民主的幌子，欺骗人民，另一只手则积极布置了空前规模的内战。在这一年紧张复杂时日中，中国人民特别是解放区军民受到深刻的教训，给上了两大课，这是解放区军民永远不会忘记的。
    六月蒋美所布置的大规模内战爆发了。蒋介石集中近五十个旅的兵力，向我晋冀鲁豫解放区沿着三条战线发动攻势，我全区军民在我党中央集中优势兵力各个歼灭敌人，不在一城一地之得失，而在消灭敌人有生力量的运动战方针下，开始了全民的爱国自卫战争。我们在半年的自卫战争中，在后方工作与前方工作，地方工作与军队工作，土地改革与自卫战争及在运动战与广大游击战的密切配合下，我们赢得了自卫战争的初步胜利。仅这半年中即歼灭蒋伪军正规部队十六个旅，总数达十一万人。而我们军队则没有被消灭过一个营，我们是愈战愈强，运用毛主席的战略指导方针也更加熟练，对美蒋反动派情况的了解亦愈加透彻。因而对粉碎美蒋进攻、保卫人民斗争果实亦更具信心。
    一九四六年另外一件值得回忆的大事是土地改革的基本完成；在抗战期间，农民曾三次伸出手来要求实现耕者有其田，我们没有批准。反攻以后，农民重新提出了这一要求，我党同意了并且起来领导全体农民实行耕者有其田。一年以来，我全晋冀鲁豫区已基本上完成了土地改革，六百五十万贫雇农民已分到一千八百万亩土地，两千万农民已从封建压榨下解放出来，其中百分之六十已参加了农会，十万青壮年已投入自卫战争前线，现在土地改革仍在继续进行中，虽然还有少数人认为这是过火的行动，在背后咬着耳朵的议论着，但他们的观点已是陈旧和腐朽了的。党的方针决不变更，我们也决不因战争或其他任何情况影响，而稍加放松，一定要贯彻到底，使三千万人民在一九四七年春耕以前获得彻底解放。
    一九四七年在全面炮火声中到来了，他给我们带来了新的更艰巨的任务。根据我晋冀鲁豫解放区具体情况，将是全力进行自卫战争，开展大生产运动及文教工作。
    美帝国主义及蒋介石独夫，必将动员其一切反动力量继续向中国人民作孤注一掷的极其残暴的进攻，我全区党政军民必须集中全力，紧张的继续进行爱国自卫战争。一切作战兵团游击队武工队人民武装必须更加虚心学习研究毛主席的战略思想和熟练其作战指导方针，军队中要继续贯彻实行毛主席的群众路线，打好仗，练好兵，做好群众工作。后方要保证兵员、弹药、粮秣、被服等的源源供给和完善的医疗救护工作。前后方一致为继续歼灭蒋军第二个第三个十六个旅而奋斗。我们有充分胜利信心，而且亦日益接近胜利，但我们亦有很大困难，我们五分之一的地区暂时被蒋军占领变为游击区，必须坚持这些地区的游击战争，这与将来配合正规军收复失地有重大关系。
    在八年抗战一年自卫战争之后，国民经济枯竭，财政经济困难，我们应当发展生产，提倡节约与科学的计算，努力克服这一困难。加之土地改革完成后，群众亦迫切要求兴家立业发财致富。因此今年全区一定要发动一个大规模的生产运动，努力生产，保证军需民食，党政民的各级人员，要拿出百分之九十的力量来组织领导生产，普遍作到耕三余一，普遍发展合作社，普遍发展农业，家庭副业，小手工业，工场手工业，运输事业及纺织业，以争取达到自给自足。
    土地改革以后，人民必将要求受教育，提高文化，讲求卫生等等，因此全区在农民翻身之后，应普遍来进行一次翻身教育，并普遍开展国民教育，以普及并提高解放区人民的文化和卫生水平。
    世界走向民主，中国走向民主，整个形势对我是有利的。努力艰苦奋斗，在党中央正确领导下，在毛泽东旗帜下渡过这一段困难路程，光明就会到来，胜利一定是我们的，这就是我们的回顾与前瞻。
