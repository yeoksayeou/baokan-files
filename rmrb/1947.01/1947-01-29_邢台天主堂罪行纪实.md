A True Record of the Crimes of the Xingtai Catholic Church
Tang Ximin

On September 24, 1945, Xingtai City was liberated. The democratic government, adhering to the policy of freedom of religious belief, immediately issued an order to protect the Catholic Church upon entering the city. To ensure the safety of the church's missionaries as they inspected church affairs, the Xingtai Chengguan District Government issued certificates of identification to Bishop Ge Lecai and other missionaries on October 16th. Subsequently, the democratic government issued them various long-term passes and curfew permits, guaranteeing their freedom of movement and religious activities. The democratic government also provided appropriate material assistance, issuing the orphanage affiliated with the church 4,000 jin of wheat and 5,000 jin of coal, and the Yide Middle School 3,000 jin of wheat and a large amount of firewood. In 1946, 200,000 yuan was issued to Yide Middle School as a production fund; in October, a subsidy was issued, totaling over 2 million yuan.

The democratic government’s protection and support of the church can be described as utmost benevolence. However, these evil clergymen, in the name of spreading religion, continued their past atrocities of colluding with the enemy and puppets, and cruelly harming the people. They brazenly concealed traitors, Chiang Kai-shek spies, and local bullies, actively organized secret agents, plotted to launch riots, and poisoned the broad masses of Xingtai City.

In 1937, after the Japanese invaders occupied Xingtai, they arbitrarily slaughtered residents in the city, and the masses fled to the Catholic Church for refuge. The priests took the opportunity to force conversions and extort money. They stipulated that only Catholics were allowed to enter, and if one was not yet a Catholic, they had to convert immediately to be accepted. In this way, the Catholic Church developed nearly 3,000 "church members" within a year.

Those who converted to Catholicism had to attend Mass, and each Mass cost one dou of rice. Staying in the church also required paying for food, also one dou of rice per month. However, many people only stayed for a little over three months, yet they were forced to pay for a year's worth of food. Zhang Xiusan was one of the hundreds of people who paid for a year's worth of food despite staying for less than three months before being released.

After the enemy and puppets ruled Xingtai, priests like Ge Lecai and Lang Benren closely colluded with Japanese chiefs and major traitors. During the mass search of the priests' bedrooms, many photos of them with Japanese chiefs and major traitors like Gao Delin were found, along with military train passes issued by the Headquarters of the Japanese Army in North China to Zhao Wenquan, a priest of the church, and more than 70 blank passes (that could be filled in at any time and used, enjoying the same treatment as important enemy and puppet officials).

In early 1938, when Ge Lecai returned to China from the United States, the Eurasian Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially introduced him to the Japanese ambassador to "China", entrusting him to take good care of him. The headquarters of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army also wrote a special permit for Ge.

In August 1939, they further used the excuse that the church in Xinchang Village was "robbed by bandits" and requested the puppet Xingtai County Government to send troops to the western countryside to "suppress bandits" (see the puppet Hebei Province Xingtai County Government's reply to the Catholic Church, Fa Zi No. 27 of August 1938). In the spring of 1945, priest Lang Benren personally requested Gao Delin to lead troops to sweep through Pingxiang, killing more than ten people, including the uncle and father of Shi Qinglu. Lang Benren has confessed to this point because he could not conceal it.

They relied on the enemy and puppets to forcibly buy people's land. They colluded with the enemy and repeatedly went to Baita Village to arrest people, forcing the masses of the village to sell them more than two qing of land at a low price. After buying the land, they refused to let the masses allocate grain. Because the masses repeatedly urged them, they again used the excuse of theft and again asked the Japanese army to arrest people in the village. The people had no choice but to endure the pain and give up, and personally went to the Catholic Church to kowtow to the priests, sending 2,000 eggs and a silver shield.

Baita Village used to be a famous wealthy village. Since the Catholic Church acquired two qing of land in the village, because the Catholic Church did not allow the masses to allocate grain, the burden of the two qing of land was still borne by the masses of Baita Village. When the enemy was there, Baita Village was supposed to provide a railway worker for every five mu of land, but because they had to bear the burden of the Catholic Church's land, not only did those who cultivated only one or two mu have to provide labor, but even Wu Tang, who cultivated two fen of land, and women like Shi Guo's also had to provide labor. Therefore, the masses of the village said, "The root of Baita Village's poverty lies in this labor service."

On the eve of Xingtai's liberation, when puppet traitors like Gao Delin and Ren Xiaomin (puppet administrative commissioner) were preparing to abandon the city and flee, the priests were greatly alarmed. They tried their best to request the two traitors Gao and Ren to continue to hold on and rule Xingtai. Lang Benren admitted this in his confession. In the diary of the church's deputy bishop, De Yingqian (from Beijing), it was clearly written: "September 16th... We asked Commander Gao not to leave and continue to hold on..." The teachers of Yide Middle School, which was run by the church, and some missionaries paraded on the streets every day, intercepting pedestrians and forcibly collecting donations to comfort the puppet troops guarding the city and encourage them to continue to hold on.

After the liberation of Xingtai, when the people's army was searching for traitors in the city, the Catholic Church used the signboard of a religious organization to hide a group of big and small traitors who had nowhere to escape, and successively tried to secretly release them. Based on definite evidence alone, there were 43 major traitors, including Xiao Jiexian, the deputy commander of the puppet security force, and his family, Liu Yuanjie, a Japanese spy, the family of Ren Xiaomin, the puppet commissioner, Cao Shikui, an inspector of the puppet Daos, Wu Lanfu, the head of the puppet security regiment, Xu Wenjiu, a section chief of the puppet Daos, Hao Mengjiu, the puppet county magistrate of Wei County, and Zheng Maolin, the captain of the puppet army.

They also took this opportunity to make a big fortune from the traitors. When the big and small traitors fled, they transported their assets to the church. Lang Benren even led drivers to take all the things left in Gao Delin's mansion, taking away a total of 520 bags of flour, seven shi of rice, 20,000 jin of slag, ten packages of sea salt, 15 bicycles, and all other utensils. They even hung a sign of the Catholic Church's Gongjiao Hospital Clinic on the gate of Gao's mansion. They also transported 40 bags and 35 sacks of rice, 30 boxes of white paper, 150 tons of coal, 30 bags of cement, and more than 2,500 railway ties from the Japanese consulate and Suzuki store.

In total, the value of these looted and concealed enemy and puppet materials was at least over 30 million yuan. Among the materials seized this time, there were five large boxes of belongings from Wang Yingcai, Cao Shikui, and others, as well as 1,167 pieces of clothing, with the names of the traitors traceable.

Among the major traitors they secretly released, such as Japanese spy Liu Yuanjie, had already been captured by the masses. Because he was injured in the leg and recuperating in the Catholic Church, Lang Benren personally wrote a guarantee, but in the end, he also sheltered and released him. No wonder Liu Yuanjie wrote a letter of thanks to Lang Benren after escaping to Shijiazhuang, saying: "Reverend Lang, your bravery, love, and enthusiasm truly make me admire you."

With the development of the mass movement in various places, many local bullies transported their assets to the Catholic Church at night to hide them, and some simply lived inside, spreading rumors to the outside world. There were more than 50 such local bullies. However, the masses gradually woke up. Last October, the general public and Catholics took Xu Guanying, a puppet army captain, from the church to be executed. The priests initially firmly denied that local bully Jia Yongquan from Chenghuangmiao Street had hidden a large amount of materials in the Catholic Church, but when the masses identified Jia's hidden items, they had no choice but to return them to the masses, including 43 pieces of wooden furniture, five boxes of Western medicine, and twelve bags of opium, and two boxes of clothes.

When Xingtai was first liberated, the big spy Gao Lianjiu hid in the Catholic Church for two days, and established a Xingtai spy organization with Ge Lecai, Lang Benren, Qiao Zhiyi, and others in the Catholic Church, and maintained close contact with the Chiang Kai-shek spies in Shijiazhuang. Under the leadership of priests like Lang Benren and Qiao Zhiyi, they first vigorously expanded the organization in Yide Middle School and actively carried out activities. They also changed Lu Xianli, the captain of Xu Tieying's bandit gang from Yongnian, into Li Chungui, disguised him as a miller, and hid him in the Catholic Church (he has been arrested by the government and confessed).

A group of progressive students in Yide Middle School refused to be fooled, so Lang Benren and others planned to poison and set fire to harm these students. Last October, Lang Benren asked Kong Caizhi to transfer a package of poison to student Wang Zhenyue, ordering him to throw it into the well. Wang Zhenyue walked to the well, and his conscience suddenly discovered, he could not bear to commit this crime. The plan to poison failed, Lang Benren and others again planned to set fire, burn down the houses where progressive students like Liu Shiji lived, and burn Liu and others to death. The arrangements were already in place, but the treacherous plan could not be carried out due to the start of the war preparations.

The biggest conspiracy case was the active preparation for an armed riot. At the time of Xingtai's liberation, they had successively hidden more than 60 firearms belonging to traitors, and planned to continue collecting large quantities, attempting to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek army's invasion to launch a riot, in order to achieve their conspiracy to sabotage the democratic government.

The Catholic Church ran an orphanage, and most of the orphans inside were abducted. During the enemy and puppet rule, according to a notification in February 1944 alone, they were allocated 600 bags of flour in the name of the orphanage. Where did these flours go? The priests had wine and meat at every meal four times a day. More than a thousand bottles of wine were found in this liquidation, and Ge Lecai's foreign dog also had to eat Western food. However, the infants usually ate only corn porridge and pancakes, and in 1943 they ate sorghum pancakes with shells. Therefore, in 1943 alone, according to their own records, 619 infants died of starvation. The priests were licentious and shameless, doing whatever they wanted. In his confession, Lang Benren admitted to raping seven female believers and often going to a Japanese prostitute.

Under the just and bright mirror of the masses, these war criminal villains have been exposed.

    邢台天主堂罪行纪实
    唐西民
    一九四五年九月廿四日，邢台市解放了。民主政府一本信教自由的政策，于进城后即下令保护天主教堂。为了保证该堂传教士四出视察教务的安全，十月十六日邢台城关区政府发给该堂主教葛乐才等传教证明书。此后，民主政府复先后发给他们各种长期通行证及戒严证，保证他们自由行动与自由传教。民主政府在物质上亦予以适当的补助。曾发给该堂附设之孤儿院麦子四千斤，煤炭五千斤，义德中学麦子三千斤及大批木柴；四六年又发给义德中学生产基金廿万元；十月份又发给补助费一部，总计当在二百万元以上。
    民主政府对该教堂的保护与扶助可谓仁至义尽了。然而，这些恶教士们却假传教之名，继续其过去勾结敌伪、惨害人民的暴行，大肆掩藏汉奸、蒋特、恶霸，积极组织特务，阴谋举行暴动，毒害邢台市广大群众。
    三七年，日寇侵占邢台后，在城内任意屠杀居民，群众纷纷逃往天主堂内避难。神甫们乘机进行强迫入教和敲诈的行为。规定必须是教民才准进门，如尚未在教，则必须马上信教才肯收容；就是这样地，天主教在一年内，发展了将近三千个“教友”。
    信奉了天主教的必须上弥撒，上一次弥撒一斗米。住在教堂内，还得交伙食费，每月也是一斗米。但有好多人只住了三个多月，却硬要他们出一年的粮食，张秀三就是住了不到三个月，出了一年的粮食，才被放出来的几百个人中的一个。
    敌伪统治邢台后，葛乐才和郎本仁等神甫便与日酋及大汉奸密切勾结，此次群众在该神甫等卧室内，即搜出他们与日酋及大汉奸高德林等合照像片多幅，并有华北日军总司令部发给该堂神甫赵文泉的军用列车乘车许可证，及空白通行证七十余张（可随时填写使用，与敌伪要员享受同等待遇）。
    三八年初，葛乐才由美返华，道经东京时，日本外务省欧亚司曾给日驻“华”大使特别介绍，托妥为招呼，敌华北派遣军司令部亦为葛特写特许证件。
    三九年八月，他们更借口心长村教堂“遭匪抢掠”，要求伪邢台县署派队到西乡“剿匪”（见伪河北省邢台县公署三八年八月致天主堂复函法字第二十七号）四五年春，神甫郎本仁更亲自要求高德林带队伍到平乡扫荡，杀死史清禄的伯父、叔父等十余人。这一点郎本仁因无法掩盖，已坦白承认了。
    他们依仗敌伪强买民田。勾通敌人，屡次到白塔村抓人逼使该村群众贱卖给他们两顷多地。买地后，又不让群众拨粮，因为群众一再催促，乃又借口失盗，再次请日军到该村抓人。老百姓没有办法，只好忍痛作罢，并亲到天主堂向神甫们磕头求情，送鸡蛋两千，银盾一面。
    白塔村过去是有名的富村，自天主堂在该村置地两顷以后，因为天主堂不让群众拨粮，两顷地的负担依然加在白塔村群众身上，敌人在时，白塔村本应五亩地出一个看铁道的民夫，由于负担天主堂地的夫，结果不仅种一、二亩地的都出了夫，连种二分地的吴堂和妇女史郭氏等也出了夫。所以该村群众都说：“白塔村的穷根，就在这出夫上”。
    在邢台解放的前夕，当高德林、任晓民（伪行政专员）等伪逆准备弃城逃跑的时候，神甫们大大地着慌了，他们竭力请求高、任二逆继续坚守，统治邢台。郎本仁在供诉中曾承认了这一点；在搜出的该堂副主教德英谦（北平人）的日记中，也这样明白的写着：“九月十六日，……我们请求高司令不要走，继续坚守。……”该堂所设的义德中学的教员们和一些传教士每日在各街游行，截留行人，强行募款，用来慰劳守城的伪军，鼓励伪军们继续坚守。
    邢台解放后，人民军队在城关搜查汉奸，这时、天主堂便打起了宗教团体的招牌，将一群无处可避的大小汉奸隐藏在天主堂内，陆续设法秘密放走。仅证据确切的便有伪保安副司令萧结贤及其家属、日军特务刘元杰，伪专员任晓民之家属、伪道署视察曹世奎、伪保安团长吴兰甫、伪道署科长徐文久，伪威县县长郝梦九及伪军大队长郑茂林等大汉奸四十三人。
    他们更趁此机会，大大的发了一笔汉奸财，各大小汉奸在逃窜时，纷纷将资财运到教堂内。郎本仁并带领车夫，将高德林公馆内所留东西扫数拉去，共拉走洋面五百二十袋，大米七石、砟子二万斤、海盐十包、自行车十五辆，及其他一切用具，甚至一度在高逆公馆门上挂上了天主教公教医院珍疗所的牌子。他们也曾在日本领事馆及铃木商店运走大米四十包又三十五袋，白纸三十箱，煤炭一百五十吨，洋灰三十包及道木二千五百余根。
    总计此种抢劫与窝藏的敌伪物资，至少约值三万万元以上。即此次查获的物资中，有汉奸名号可查的，也有王英才、曹世奎等的东西五大箱，及衣服一千一百六十七件。
    在他们秘密放走的大汉奸中，如日特刘元杰、本已为群众查获，因他腿上受伤在天主堂养病，郎本仁曾亲自打了保条，但结果亦将他掩护放走了。无怪刘元杰逃到石门后给郎本仁写信致谢说：“可钦敬的郎大司铎，你的勇敢爱人热心真使我钦佩”。
    随着各地群众运动的开展，许多恶霸于夜间把资财往天主堂运藏，有的就干脆住到了里面去，向外面散布起谣言。这样的恶霸先后有五十多人。不过群众是逐渐觉醒了，一般群众和教民在去年十月里从教堂内要走伪军队长徐冠英枪决了。城隍庙街恶霸贾永泉在天主堂窝藏的大批物资，神甫们始则坚不承认，但当群众将贾的藏物对单找出来后，也不得不退给群众了，共有木器四十三件，西药五箱，及毒品白面十二袋，衣服二箱。
    当邢台刚解放时，大特务高连九到天主堂内躲藏了两天，与葛乐才、郎本仁、乔志义等在天主堂内建立了邢台的特务组织，并与石门蒋特经常取得密切联系。在郎本仁、乔志义等神甫领导下，首先在义德中学内猛烈扩大组织，积极活动；并将永年伪匪铁磨头——许铁英的大队长芦先礼改名为李春贵，化装成磨面人，隐藏在天主堂内（已经政府逮捕坦白）。
    义德中学内有一批进步学生不肯上当，郎本仁等乃计划以毒药、及纵火毒害这些学生。去年十月郎本仁曾让孔才智转毒药一包给学生王振岳，令其投入井中，王振岳走到井边一时良心发现，未忍下此毒手。投毒之计不成，郎本仁等复谋布置纵火，焚毁进步学生刘士骥等所住的房子，将刘等烧死，布置本已就绪，因备战开始未能逞其奸计。
    而最大的阴谋案，则是积极准备武装暴动。在邢台解放时，他们曾先后隐藏了汉奸枪支六十余支，并计划继续大量收集，妄图配合蒋军进犯举行暴动，达到其破坏民主政权的阴谋。
    天主堂附设了一所孤儿院，里面的孤儿大多是拐骗来的。在敌伪统治时代，仅四四年二月的一次通知书上，他们即借孤儿院之名配给到面粉六百袋。这些面粉究竟弄到那里去了呢？神甫们一天四餐每餐必有酒肉，在这次清算中即搜出葡萄酒达千瓶之多，葛乐才的洋狗也得吃西餐。而婴儿们平常吃的只是玉茭稀汤和饼，四三年吃的竟是带壳高粱面饼。因此仅四三年一年内，据他们自己的存根，便饿死婴儿六百十九名，神甫们荒淫无耻，胡作妄为，郎本仁在供词中，自认曾奸污七个女教徒，并经常到一个日本妓女那里去。
    在群众正义而明亮的照妖镜下，这些战犯恶棍已是原形毕露了。
