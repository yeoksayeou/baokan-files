　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 18th dispatch】 Meng County, Northern Henan, continues to launch a comprehensive counter-liquidation offensive. The militia armed forces are awe-inspiring throughout the county, destroying puppet regimes everywhere and reclaiming their emancipated gains. Last November, under the conspiratorial cover of special agent Zhang Bohua, landlords organized "Mediation Committees" to reverse the results of the struggle by emancipated peasants. Therefore, a vigorous counter-"liquidation" struggle was launched throughout the county. First, the militia of the Sixth District, in coordination with the militia of the Second District of Jiyuan, launched attacks day and night in December, passing through a sixty-mile blockade line, raiding the enemy's heartland villages of Huagong, Mengjiang, and Tianshi, capturing several liquidation elements, and destroying the so-called "Mediation Committee." Other districts also simultaneously carried out counter-liquidation struggles. The militia of the First District launched thirteen attacks in half a month from January. Due to defending the gains of emancipation, they defeated a battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek army with twelve people in the grid network, creating a model for militia combat throughout the county, posting slogans in enemy strongholds such as Yusi and Zhang Jiayue, and warning liquidation elements. The militia of the Fourth and Sixth Districts harassed the enemy six times in half a month, capturing six people, including Fan Hengnian, the secretary-general of the Nanlinquan "Mediation Committee," and seizing two rifles. Led by Guo Xiaosan of the Military Affairs Committee of the Third District, the militia crossed the Mang River, penetrated thirty miles into the enemy's heart, captured liquidation elements such as Cheng Huaiyu, and used "flying all over the sky" guerrilla tactics to attack the enemy everywhere, creating a tremendous momentum and awe-inspiring the entire county. In the past half month, the county has carried out forty-six counter-liquidation battles, killing and wounding twelve liquidation team members, capturing seventeen liquidation team members, capturing more than thirty enemy Bao and Jia chiefs, seizing two rifles, more than seventy rounds of ammunition, and four grenades, causing the "Mediation Committees" of the Third and Fourth Districts to collapse completely. Landlords in Lingbei and other villages personally returned a lot of property to the masses. Someone sent counter-liquidation propaganda directly to Zhang Bohua on the south bank of the Yellow River, so he said angrily: "Our subordinates are really unreliable, and they are still sending messages to the Eighth Route Army!"
　　
    【This newspaper, Taiyue, 18th dispatch】 The counter-liquidation offensive in the border area of Jiyuan was victorious, the puppet regime was destroyed, and the land was returned to the peasants. More than ten villages east of Zhoulou Village in the Second District of Jiyuan and west of Baiqiang Village in the Fourth District of Meng County, north of the Zhiqian wall, were the lairs of stubborn pseudo-bandits and reactionary landlord "liquidation teams." Since the Chiang Kai-shek army occupied Ji and Meng, they have buried alive and shot dead twenty of our village cadres and masses, such as Liu Zhen and Zhao Kela, in Zhiqian and Linqing villages. At the same time, reactionary landlords such as Xue Xueqi in Zhiqian Village and Wang Lichun in Baiqiang Village took the lead in liquidating the emancipated masses. In addition to taking back the land, Wang Lichun also demanded seven dou of wheat per mu of land. After our army recaptured Jiyuan, more than 400 militia members from the Second District of Jiyuan, in coordination with the Fourth and Sixth District militia of Meng County, launched a fierce offensive in the area, attacking from the north of the Mang River to the south of the Mang River. In half a month, they fought twelve battles, and the Chiang Kai-shek army was defeated. All Chiang-Kai-shek puppet regimes were destroyed, the democratic government was re-established, the liquidated land and houses were returned to the peasants, and three liquidation landlords, including Zhao Sheng, were captured. Cui Guqi, a landlord in Zhiqian Village, quickly returned the liquidated land to the peasants and apologized to the masses. From then on, the Bao and Li chiefs of more than ten villages, such as Zhiqian and Linqing, went to the democratic government to make contact, willing to reform themselves.

    【本报太岳十八日电】豫北孟县，继续展开全面反倒算攻势，民兵武装威震全县，到处摧毁伪政权，夺回自己的翻身果实。去年十一月在特务头子张伯华的阴谋掩护下，地主组织“调解委员会”，向翻身农民倒算斗争果实，因此全县轰轰烈烈的展开了反“倒算”斗争。首先六区民兵配合济源二区民兵，于十二月日夜出击，通过六十里封锁线，袭入敌人心脏化工、孟江、田市等村，捕捉倒算分子数名，摧毁了所谓“调解委员会”。其他各区亦同时进行反倒算斗争，一区民兵从一月起半月中出击十三次，由于保卫翻身果实，在格子网中以十二个人击溃了蒋军一个营，创造了全县民兵战斗的范例，将标语贴至禹寺、张贾约等敌人的据点内，警告了倒算分子。四、六区民兵半月袭扰敌人六次，活捉了南林泉“调解委员会”书记长范恒年等六名，缴获步枪两支。三区民兵在武委会郭小三率领下，越过蟒河，深入敌人腹心三十里，捕获倒算分子程怀玉等，并以“满天飞”的游击战术，到处袭击敌人，声势浩大，威震全县。半月来全县进行反倒算战四十六次，毙伤倒算队十二名，俘倒算队十七名，捕获敌保甲长三十余人，缴获步枪二支，子弹七十余发，手榴弹四颗，使三、四区的“调解委员会”全部垮台，岭北等村地主亲自送还群众好多财产。有人把反倒算宣传品直送到黄河南岸张伯华手里，因此他很生气的说：“咱们的部下真不可靠，还给八路军传信哩！”
    【本报太岳十八日电】济源边沿区反倒算攻势胜利，伪政权被摧毁，土地重归农民。济源二区周楼村以东，孟县四区白墙村以西，治墙以北的十余村庄，为顽伪匪及反动地主“倒算队”的老窝，自蒋军侵占济、孟以来，活埋及枪杀我治墙、临清等村干部及群众刘祯、赵可拉等达二十人，同时以治墙村薛学圻，白墙村王立春等反动地主为头，向翻身群众进行倒算。王立春除夺回地外，一亩地还叫交七斗麦子。我军再克济源后，二区民兵配合孟县四六区民兵四百余人，向该地展开猛烈攻势，从蟒河以北向蟒河南出击，半月中交战十二次，蒋军败退，所有蒋伪政权皆摧毁，民主政府重新树立，被倒算的土地房屋仍还农民，并俘获倒算地主赵升等三名。治墙村地主崔古七，赶快将倒算的土地归还农民，并向群众谢罪。从此治墙、临清等十余村庄的保长、闾长，都往民主政府接头，愿改过自新。
