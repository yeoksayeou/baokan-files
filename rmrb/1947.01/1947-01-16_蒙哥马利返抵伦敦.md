　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th -- London dispatch: Montgomery flew back here from Moscow on the 11th. At the airport, Montgomery told reporters, "This trip to the Soviet Union was very pleasant, and I was deeply impressed by the Soviet army." Returning to England with Montgomery was Robert, the chargé d'affaires of the British Embassy in the Soviet Union. It is understood that Robert's return to England was a last-minute decision. Observers generally believe that the possible developments caused by Montgomery's trip are the reason for Robert's new return to the country to report on his work. An Associated Press dispatch on the 12th stated that Montgomery had discussed military cooperation with Soviet officers and soldiers in the Soviet Union. Agence France-Presse reported that on the day of Montgomery's departure from the Soviet Union, he had a final talk with Marshal Vasilevsky.
