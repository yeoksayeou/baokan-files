Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 27th (Delayed Dispatch): On the afternoon of the 25th, around 4:30 PM (Shanghai time), another Chiang aircraft flew low over Yan'an, the location of the CCP Central Committee, for reconnaissance and a show of force. This is another military threat by Chiang Kai-shek against the CCP Central Committee's location after his peace talk deception was exposed. The aircraft entered from the southeast, circled for a long time, and then retreated along its original path. Recently, Chiang's troops' attacks on the Guanzhong Sub-region south of Yan'an have continued, and Hu Zongnan's troops, who occupied Wuwang Mountain and other places, have not withdrawn. The reappearance of Chiang's aircraft has particularly attracted the attention of the military and civilians in Yan'an.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 28th: According to the Shanghai Wenhui Bao of the 7th of this month, a Lanzhou dispatch revealed that the Chiang side is repairing roads and actively preparing to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, stating: "The Gansu Provincial Government has decided to repair the Pingliang-Ningxia Highway (from Pingliang via Liupan Mountain, Guyuan to Zhongning) to meet 'urgent needs', requiring a huge sum of 12 billion yuan." It also stated: "Road repairs are busy everywhere in Gansu; all roads that cannot smoothly transport military trucks are being repaired. The conscription of laborers has reached its limit, and people from Gansu are complaining bitterly."

    蒋介石和谈骗局揭穿后
    蒋机竟飞延作军事威胁
    【新华社延安二十七日电】（迟到）延市上空二十五日下午四时半许（上海时间）又来蒋机一架低飞示威侦察，这是蒋介石在和谈骗局被揭破后对中共中央所在地的再次军事威胁。该机系由东南方向闯入，盘旋良久始向原路逸去。最近蒋军对延安南面关中分区之进攻仍在继续，侵占武王山等地之胡宗南部迄未撤退。蒋机之重新出现，特别引起延市军民注意。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据本月七日沪文汇报载，兰州通讯透露蒋方整修公路，积极准备进攻陕甘宁边区情形称：“甘省府决定整修平宁公路（自平凉经六盘山、固原至中宁）以应‘急需’，共计需款一百二十亿元之巨。”又称：“陇上各地整修公路忙，凡不能通畅军运卡车之公路，均重新整修，征用民夫已达极限，陇上来人均为百姓叫苦。”
