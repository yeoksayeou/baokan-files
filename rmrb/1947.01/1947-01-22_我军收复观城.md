　　Our Army Recovers Guancheng
    [This dispatch from the Jiluyu Front, January 20th] Our army recovered Guancheng and Wuqiang Town in Qingfeng (west of Guancheng) on the afternoon of the 19th. The Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched there, under constant attacks and encirclement by our army and local guerrillas, were deeply afraid of being annihilated and had no choice but to break through and flee west in a panic.
