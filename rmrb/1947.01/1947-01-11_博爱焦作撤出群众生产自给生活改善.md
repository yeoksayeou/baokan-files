　　[This newspaper, Jiaozuo News] Bo'ai Jiaozuo Evacuees Engage in Mass Production for Self-Sufficiency and Improved Living Standards
　　[Our newspaper, Jiaozuo News] With the assistance and leadership of the masses and the democratic government, citizens evacuated from Jiaozuo City are engaging in production for self-sufficiency. Under the conscious idea of "self-reliance through production, get rich and return home," and with the support of a 1.5 million yuan loan from the government, as well as the active assistance of the local masses, 4,000 full and semi-able-bodied laborers and 1,500 head of livestock have been organized to engage in transportation, commerce, textiles, and other production activities. Those not yet organized are also actively producing. Those participating in production earn an average of about six to seven jin of millet per day, in addition to food and drink. The government has recently implemented a reward system, and Liberation Street, Minsheng East Street, and Dongwangfeng Village have been commended by government order. Zhang Xiuyou, Zhang Lanying, Chen Xueyi, and others have been selected as production models. Currently, seventy to eighty percent have achieved self-sufficiency. In addition to self-sufficiency, they also actively support the front lines. As of the 15th of last month, the city headquarters had received 45 new cotton-padded clothes and nearly 100 pairs of shoes and socks. The number of those directly sending these goods to their husbands, sons, and brothers in the battalion, militia, and armed work teams is twice this number. (Hao Dong, Lian Qun)
　　[Our newspaper, Jincheng News] Under the democratic government's call for "self-reliance through production, get rich and return home," the masses transferred from Bo'ai have organized themselves to enthusiastically engage in transportation and textiles. More than 20 immigrants from the fifth district of Bo'ai, led by Kong Qinglu, a member of the county council, are engaged in transportation. He first negotiated transportation routes from Jincheng to Xingtai, with a freight rate of 70 yuan per jin. They transport goods on the outward journey and bring back salt on the return journey, which is sold by semi-able-bodied laborers. They have now made three trips, earning a net profit of 220,000 yuan after expenses. They used the profits to make new cotton-padded clothes, improving their living standards. They now eat two mi of rice per day, and their homes are heated with coal. They said happily, "We are now earning more money than we did producing at home. The liberated areas under Chairman Mao's leadership have solutions everywhere." Chen Shufu, a mass leader from Laoliangzhuang in Bo'ai, led 21 immigrants to settle in Shipenhe, Jincheng. They received relief and loans from the government and organized transportation and textiles, earning more than 100,000 yuan in profits. Everyone has put on brand-new cotton-padded clothes. They also used the profits to buy ewes to breed lambs and generate profit. They all say, "When we drive out the Jiang bandits and return home, we will drive the ewes down the mountain to show the villagers." A militiaman in the village was injured, and they offered 3,000 yuan from their profits to comfort him. (Hou Jianzhong)
