Small Tips

　　How to Make Fire?
　　Fire is indispensable in daily life, especially for smokers. Recently, matches have been very expensive, so to save money, we introduce a few small methods.

　　Homemade Matches
　　Buy some sulfur, put it in a bowl and melt it over a fire. Find some hemp stalks, broken reed mats, or dry firewood twigs, and cut them into small sticks of two or three inches long. Dip them in the sulfur liquid, and when you take them out, they become homemade matches. They are very convenient for lighting cigarettes and lamps.

　　Homemade Tinder
　　To make a fire, you need tinder in addition to a flint and steel. To make your own tinder, you can burn the stalk of a sunflower (Helianthus annuus) into ash, mix it with water to make a thin porridge, then rub old cotton wadding in it, take it out, and dry it.

　　Scraping Pot Soot
　　Take a ladle and scrape some black soot from the bottom of the cooking pot. Strike a spark with a flint and steel, and the soot can be ignited. Pour it into thatch, and a fire can be started.

　　Rub Matches on Pig Bone
　　If the box of safety matches is broken and can no longer be used for striking, find a piece of pig bone, burn it black (but not too much), and rub the remaining matches on it to ignite them.

### 怎样取火？

　　怎样取火？
    火是每天生活中不可缺少的，特别是抽烟的人。近来火柴很贵，为了节约，我们介绍几个小办法。
    自制火柴
    买些硫磺，用碗盛着放在火上熬化，找些麻杆、破席苇或干柴枝，切成两三寸长的小签，往硫磺液里一蘸，拿出来就成了自制火柴。用时，拿一根往炭火上一触，就燃着了。吸烟点灯，最为方便。
    自制火绒
    打火，有了火镰、火石还得要火绒，想自造火绒，可用望日莲（向日葵）的杆烧成灰，加水调成稀粥一样，再把旧棉花套放在里边搓一搓，捞出来晒干就成。
    刮锅灰
    拿一个杓子向作饭的锅底上刮下些黑锅灰来，用火镰打出火星，锅灰就可引着，倒入茅柴里，即可生着火。
    猪骨头擦火柴
    保险火柴的盒子要是坏了，不能再擦，可找一块猪骨头，用火烧成黑色（但不要过火），拿剩下的火柴在上面擦，就可发火。
