Xinhua News Agency, Lunan Front, 23rd: The battle to recapture Zaozhuang has ended victoriously. According to the No. 7 Communiqué issued by the East China People's Liberation Army Field Army Headquarters: After a day and night of fierce fighting to overcome strong fortifications, our army completely liberated Zaozhuang Town, a famous coal mining area in China, at 2:00 PM on the 20th. The entire enemy force entrenched in the Central China Mining Company, consisting of the 51st Division headquarters of the Chiang Kai-shek army and its directly affiliated and subsidiary arms—mountain artillery battalion, special service battalion, engineer battalion, transportation battalion, signal battalion, armored train detachment, etc.—and one regiment each from the 113th and 114th Brigades of the division, along with one battalion from the 5th Artillery Regiment, totaling over ten thousand men, was completely annihilated. The enemy suffered over three thousand killed and wounded, over eight thousand captured, and the following were seized: twelve 105mm howitzers, eight mountain guns, over thirty large and small mortars, over two hundred light and heavy machine guns, over one hundred vehicles, and countless other military supplies. It has been verified that the entire 51st Division (formerly the 51st Army), except for one battalion stationed in Tang X Zhuang (southwest of Qicun) that escaped, had already suffered the elimination of four thousand men in Guoliji, Yixian County, and Qicun, west of Zaozhuang, before the Zaozhuang campaign. Thus, the entire division has now been wiped out.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd: In the middle of the month, Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the western section of the Jiaoji Railway gathered and began to invade the Liberated Area of central Shandong. The troops of Huo Shouyi's 12th Army of Chiang Kai-shek launched an attack from Mingshui Station on the 16th, dividing into two routes. One route invaded south along the Zhang (Qiu) Lai (Wu) Highway and occupied the Zhanli area of Shangyouzhuang on the same afternoon; the other route invaded south from Bucun, south of Zhangqiu, and has occupied Beishizhuang and Nanmingzhang. In coordination with this, a part of the 193rd Division of the 73rd Army of Chiang Kai-shek in Boshan also invaded Hezhuang, 25 miles southwest of Boshan, on the 16th, attempting to attack the Laiwu area from the east, north, and northwest. In the south, the puppet army of Wu Huawen in Yanzhou has also been restless for days, attempting to occupy Qufu, and invaded Gujiazhuang and Shizhuang, more than ten miles west of Qufu, on the 15th. In addition, the 15th Division of the 73rd Army gathered in Dazhigou, south of Jinan, on the 16th, showing signs of a southward attack towards Tai'an in conjunction with the Chiang Kai-shek troops originally stationed there.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd: The "Explosion King" Li Yuquan's transportation team in central Shandong on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway has won the victory of killing, wounding, and capturing 484 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers at the cost of one death and two injuries in the past six months, and has been commended by the People's Armed Forces Department of the central Shandong Military Region. In the past six months, the team carried out a total of 26 flying explosions and combat operations. In addition to eliminating a large number of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, they seized one mountain gun, two light machine guns, and 169 rifles. Last month, when recapturing Jishanwan, southwest of Pujij Station on the Jiaoji Railway, the team cooperated with the main force, destroyed a reinforcement train, and secured a complete victory in the battle.

    缴获榴弹炮山炮二十门汽车百余辆
    【新华社鲁南前线二十三日电】收复枣庄战役已胜利结束。据华东人民解放军野战军指挥部发表第七号公报称：经过一昼夜激战克复强固之工事后，我军于二十日下午二时全部解放中国著名煤矿产地枣庄镇，将盘距中兴公司顽抗之蒋军五十一师师部及直属与附属之各兵种——山炮营、特务营、工兵营、辎重营、通讯营、铁甲车队等及该师一一三旅、一一四旅各一个团与炮兵第五团一个营共万余人全部歼灭。计毙伤三千余名，生俘八千余名，缴获十生的五之榴弹炮十二门，山炮八门，大小迫击炮三十余门，轻重机枪二百余挺，汽车百余辆，其他军火物资无算。查五十一师（原五十一军）全师除驻汤×庄（齐村西南）之一个营逃脱外，枣庄战役前曾在峄县之郭里集及枣庄西之齐村共被消灭四千余人，至此该师已全部覆灭。
    【新华社山东二十三日电】胶济西段蒋军于月中集结，开始向鲁中解放区侵犯。蒋军十二军霍守义部于十六日自明水车站分两路出犯，一路自章（邱）莱（芜）公路南侵，于当日下午侵占上游庄之站里一带地区；一路自章邱南之埠村南侵，已占北石庄、南明章。与此相配合，博山蒋军七十三军一九三师一部，亦于十六日侵至博山西南二十五里之和庄，图从东、北、西北三面合击莱芜地区。南面兖州伪军吴化文部亦连日蠢动，企图攻占曲阜，十五日侵至曲阜，西十余里顾家庄、史庄等地。另七三军之十五师十六日集结于济南以南之大芝沟，有与原驻该地蒋军南犯泰安模样。
    【新华社山东二十三日电】胶济西段鲁中爆炸大王李玉泉输战队，半年来以伤一亡二之代价赢得了毙伤俘蒋军四百八十四人之胜利，并受到鲁中军区人民武装部的表扬。半年中该队飞行爆炸及作战共二十六次，除歼灭大量蒋军外，缴获山炮一门，轻机枪两挺，步枪一六九支。上月克复胶济路普集车站西南鸡山宛时，该队配合主力作战，炸毁增援火车一列，使战斗获得全胜。
