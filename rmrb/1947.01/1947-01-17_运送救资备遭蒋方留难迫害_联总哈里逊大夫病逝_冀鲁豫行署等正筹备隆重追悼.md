　　Transport of Relief Supplies Obstructed and Persecuted by Chiang Kai-shek's Forces

    UNRRA Dr. Harrison Dies

    Jiluyu Administrative Office and Others are Preparing Solemn Memorial Service

    [Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Harrison (Canadian), a friend of China from UNRRA, suffered serious illness due to repeated obstruction by Chiang Kai-shek's forces while transporting relief supplies to Zhangqiu County in the Liberated Area. He passed away on the 9th of this month despite various medical treatments. Mr. Riak (Canadian) from the Canadian Red Cross, who accompanied him, and Mr. Clemons (American) from the China Road Transport Company personally oversaw the entombment. Dr. Harrison had been working hard for the cause of peace and democracy in China. This time, he brought twelve trucks of medicine donated by the Canadian Red Cross to Zhangqiu County in the Liberated Area on the 9th. It is reported that he was placed under surveillance by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents from the moment he left Shanghai. On the way to Kaifeng, Dr. Harrison's luggage was stolen by Chiang's special agents, and he caught a cold. Near Xuzhou, Chiang's army illegally detained Mr. Harrison's train loaded with medicine. After several unsuccessful negotiations, it was only after the UNRRA plane arrived that it was sent to Kaifeng. The journey took twenty days and was extremely arduous. Mr. Riak said, "Mr. Harrison had to fetch water from a pit to quench his thirst, and his illness became increasingly serious when he arrived in Kaifeng." Mr. Harrison disregarded his illness and traveled back and forth to Kaifeng twice. After arriving in Zhangqiu with the medicine this time, his condition deteriorated and he passed away on the evening of the 9th. The Jiluyu Administrative Office, the Relief Sub-Committee, and the Zhangqiu County Government deeply mourned Dr. Harrison's significant contributions to the Chinese people during his lifetime and are preparing a solemn memorial service. The Border Region Government and the Assembly are deeply saddened by his passing.

　　运送救资备遭蒋方留难迫害
    联总哈里逊大夫病逝
    冀鲁豫行署等正筹备隆重追悼
    【本报讯】中国国际友人联总哈里逊大夫（加籍）运送救济物资抵解放区张秋县，一路备受蒋方留难致罹重症，经多方医治无效，不幸于本月九日逝世。由随行者加拿大红十字会瑞阿克先生，（加籍）及中国公路运输公司克里蒙斯先生（美籍）亲视入殓。哈大夫生前努力奔走中国和平民主事业，此次携带加拿大红十字会赠解放区药品十二卡车于九日抵解放区张秋县。据悉：彼自离上海即被蒋介石特务监视，在赴开封途中，哈大夫行李被蒋特窃去，感受风寒。在徐州附近，蒋军非法扣留哈氏装载药品之火车，几经交涉无效，待联总飞机来后，始行送往开封，辗转二十日，备极辛苦。瑞阿克先生谈：“哈氏曾在坑中取水解渴，至开封时病势渐重。”哈氏曾不顾恶疾，往返开封两次，此次随药品抵张秋后，病势转危，乃于九日晚溘然长逝。冀鲁豫行署与救济分会及张秋县政府，痛念哈氏生前对中国人民的重大贡献，正筹备隆重追悼。边区政府及参议会均沉痛吊唁。
