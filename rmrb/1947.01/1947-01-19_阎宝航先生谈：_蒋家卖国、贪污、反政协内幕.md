Mr. Yan Baohang Talks About:
    The Inside Story of the Chiang Family's Betrayal of the Country, Corruption, and Opposition to the Political Consultative Conference

Mr. Yan Baohang, a well-known democratic figure from Northeast China, was the General Secretary of the YMCA in Shenyang before the September 18th Incident. After the incident, he entered the customs and served as the General Secretary of Chiang Kai-shek's New Life Movement Headquarters and the Consul General in Blagoveshchensk. When Chiang and his confidants Dai Li, Kang Ze, Deng Wenyi, etc., organized the "Four Dimensions Society," they also tried to get him to join. However, Chiang's consistent betrayal of the country and dictatorship made Mr. Yan realize that he could not recover the Northeast by relying on such a person, so he turned to engage in the democratic movement and suffered much oppression from Chiang. He was almost beaten to death by secret agents during a petition in Xiaguan last year. He returned to Harbin on November 16th. The following are some of the inside stories of Chiang's political affairs that he revealed during an interview with a reporter from the Northeast Daily and in a lecture at a middle school.

    Chiang's Compromise Negotiations with Japan

    During the "July 7th" Incident, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to resist Japan. However, when the War of Resistance reached its most difficult time (after the fall of Wuhan), Chiang Kai-shek revealed extreme wavering and surrenderist thoughts. Mr. Yan was working in the government at that time. He described the situation at the time as follows: One day, Kong Xiangxi hosted anti-Japanese leaders, and he was also invited. At the meeting, Kong Xiangxi openly stated: "Want to fight? There's no money!" At this time, Chiang Kai-shek also sent a senior official to Hong Kong to negotiate a compromise with Japan with the German ambassador, Dr. Oskar Trautmann. Chiang Kai-shek gave this senior official three conditions: (1) Japan withdraws from Central and South China; (2) The special status of North China can be discussed; (3) The Northeast is not mentioned at all. Chiang Kai-shek communicated with this senior official seven times a day by telegram.

    "If that senior official hadn't told me personally, I would never have believed it!" Mr. Yan said, recalling this thrilling event, his emotions still tense.

    No Peace Allowed in the Northeast

    After the victory of the War of Resistance, the only hope of the people of the whole country was peace. At that time, there was a "Political Consultative Conference" attended by all parties in the country to discuss a peaceful solution to the China problem, but Chiang Kai-shek insisted on excluding the Northeast.

    At that time, Mr. Yan and some people from the Northeast organized a "Northeast Political Construction Association," advocating solving the Northeast problem through political consultation instead of using force. In April last year, when the war in the Northeast was fierce and Chiang's army suffered heavy losses, Chen Cheng, Chiang Kai-shek's Chief of Staff, invited the members of the association to dinner and expressed his agreement with this proposal; it seemed that the ceasefire in the Northeast was already hopeful, waiting only for the signing of both sides. That evening (April 12th), Mr. Yan also spoke to Chen Cheng on the phone, but at eight o'clock the next morning, when he rushed to Chen Cheng's residence, the situation suddenly changed. Chen Cheng went to the airport at 7:30 a.m., leaving the matter alone. After the fact, Mr. Yan learned that Chiang Kai-shek had returned to Chongqing from Guizhou on the 12th and instructed Chen Cheng not to resolve the issue peacefully, so Chen Cheng had no choice but to leave.

    "What to investigate? No need to investigate!"

    Mr. Yan told the students of a middle school: "You may not believe what I say about the corruption of the Kuomintang government, but I know two facts for sure.

    "The year before last, at a pro-government National Political Consultative Conference, Councilor Fu Sinian raised a case of corruption and demanded an investigation. The case was like this: The government because the official price and market price of US dollar bonds differed too much—the official price was 20 yuan, and it could be sold for 700 or 800 on the market—ordered a halt to the sale of bonds. Who knew that after the order, 4 million yuan of bonds were secretly sold. After this case was raised at the Consultative Conference, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Dai Li to investigate. The result of the investigation was that the seller was none other than Kong Xiangxi! Chiang Kai-shek asked Kong Xiangxi about it, saying, 'Do you still need this money?' Kong said, 'I took it for charitable work, and Madam—that is, Soong Mei-ling—took 3 million yuan for expenses abroad.' Chiang Kai-shek didn't ask any further. Dai Li came to ask for instructions again, and Chiang Kai-shek said to him, 'What to investigate? No need to investigate!' After the victory of the War of Resistance, the receiving personnel in various places were even more 'no official not corrupt, no clerk not dirty.' Qian Dajun, as the mayor of Shanghai, wanted everything he saw and took it casually, which was really outrageous, so someone sued him. When the lawsuit reached Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Kai-shek wrote: 'This person is inherently corrupt, it is not worth mentioning!' Of the houses in Shanghai, there were a total of 30,000 enemy properties, but only 300 were reported. Soong Ziwen alone made 3 million yuan during the reception and deposited it in the bank. He ate 8% interest, and the bank ate 2% interest. An old friend of mine, Mr. Qian, came to the Northeast to investigate and was simply driven crazy. He said to the receiving personnel face to face: 'What are you receiving? You are receiving the tears of the people of the Northeast!'"

    How was the Political Consultative Conference line destroyed?

    "I saw the anti-Soviet parade this year (referring to the large parade launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries on February 22nd last year) with my own eyes. Students who did not participate in the parade were not only suspended from meals for two months, but were also gradually expelled afterward; those who participated in the parade were given food, money, and reserved trucks. Some students from Fudan University who participated received 2 million yuan. A student from Fudan exposed the facts and opposed this parade that falsely claimed to represent public opinion. Secret agents among the students pinned him to the ground and beat him up. Professor Hong Shen stepped forward to dissuade them and was also beaten. I met the parade in Du You Street. Because my two children were in Nankai, I paid attention to the students from Nankai and saw a large truck with a person standing on it, shouting: 'Students, pay attention! Two more of our students have been beaten to death in front of the New China Daily!' I was surprised to hear this, so I detoured to the New China Daily to see, and it was not the case at all! On the contrary, the New China Daily was destroyed beyond recognition by secret agents. The person shouting on the truck was a secret agent. They organized this anti-Soviet parade with the intention of provoking an international war and also wanted to use the slogan of anti-Soviet to oppose the Communist Party and the democratic movement and tear up the political resolutions!"

### 阎宝航先生谈：  蒋家卖国、贪污、反政协内幕

　　阎宝航先生谈：
    蒋家卖国、贪污、反政协内幕
    著名东北民主人士阎宝航先生，九一八前是沈阳基督教青年会的总干事，事变后入关，曾任蒋介石的新生活运动总会的总干事和驻伯力的总领事。蒋与其亲信戴笠、康泽、邓文仪等组织“四维学会”时，也曾拉他参加。但蒋的一贯卖国独裁，使阎先生明白靠这样人不能收复东北，于是转而从事民主运动，受到蒋的许多压迫。去年下关请愿时，几乎被特务打死。十一月十六日回到哈尔滨，下面是他对东北日报记者谈话和在一中讲演时，所揭穿的一些蒋家政治内幕。
    蒋日妥协谈判
    “七、七”蒋介石被迫抗日，可是到了抗战最困难的时候（武汉失守后），蒋介石显露了极度的动摇和投降思想，阎先生那时正在政府里做事。他这样叙述当时的情形：有一天孔祥熙招待抗日领袖，他也被招待去了，孔祥熙在会上公开提出来：“要打仗？没有钱！”而这时蒋介石也派了大员到香港去，和德国大使陶德曼谈判对日妥协，蒋介石交给这个大员三个条件：（一）日本撤退华中华南；（二）华北特殊化可以谈；（三）东北根本不提。蒋介石一天和这个大员通七次电报。
    “要不是那个大员亲口告诉我，我无论如何不会相信的！”阎先生追述当时这一段惊心动魄的事情，还不减其紧张的情绪。
    不准东北和平
    抗战胜利以后，全国人民唯一的希望是和平，那时有一个全国各党派都参加的“政治协商会议”，商谈和平解决中国问题，可是蒋介石坚持要将东北除外。
    那时，阎先生和一些东北人士，组织了一个“东北政治建设协会”，主张不用武力，用政治协商的方法来解决东北问题。去年四月间，东北大战激烈，蒋军遭受重挫之时，有一次，蒋介石的参谋总长陈诚邀该会同人吃饭，表示同意这个主张；眼看东北停战已经有了希望，只等着双方的签字。当晚（四月十二日），阎先生还和陈诚通了电话，但是第二天早晨八点钟，当他赶到陈诚公馆的时候，却突然变了卦，陈诚七点半就到飞机场去了，扔下这事不管。再打电话到飞机场去，陈诚的飞机已经起飞了。事后阎先生才知道，原来蒋介石十二号从贵州回到重庆，指使陈诚不要和平解决，因此陈诚只有一走了之。
    “查什么，不用查了！”
    阎先生给一中学生们讲：“我说国民党政府贪污，你们也许还不相信，但我确知道两件事实。
    “前年，在御用的国民参政会上，参政员傅斯年提出一件贪污案要求检举，案情是这样的：政府因为美金公债的公价和市场上的价格差的太多——公价是廿元，市场上可以卖到七百八百——就下令停止卖公债，谁知在下令之后，公债竟秘密卖掉了四百万元，这件案子在参政会提出后，蒋介石就命令戴笠查办，查办的结果，卖的不是别人，原来是孔祥熙！蒋介石找孔祥熙来问，说：“你还用得着这个钱吗？”孔说：“我拿去作了慈善事业，夫人——即宋美龄——拿了三百万元做出国的费用。”蒋介石便不再往下问了，戴笠再来请示，蒋介石便对他说：“查什么，不用查了！”抗战胜利后，各地的接收人员更是“无官不贪，无吏不污。”钱大钧任上海市长，他见了东西就要，随便拿，闹的实在不像话，就有人告了他一状。状子到了蒋介石那里，蒋介石批道：“此人贪污成性，不足道也！”上海的房子，敌产共有三万幢，但是报上去的就只有剩了三百幢了。宋子文一个人在接收时就弄了三百万万，存到银行里，他吃了八分利，银行吃了两分利。我的一个老朋友钱先生到东北来清查，简直把他气疯了，他当面对接收人员说：“你们接收什么？你们接收东北人民的眼泪吧！”
    政协路线是怎样被破坏的？
    “今年的反苏大游行（按指去年二月二十二日国民党反动派发动的大游行），我是亲眼看见的，不参加游行的学生，停伙两月不算，事后还都陆续的被开除了；参加游行的又给饭又给钱又给预备卡车，复旦大学有一部分学生参加，就领到了二百万。复日的一个学生揭穿了事实，反对这种假冒民意的游行，学生里的特务分子就按在地上揍他，洪深教授上前劝阻，结果也挨了一顿打。我在都邮街曾遇见游行的队伍，因为我的两个孩子在南开，我就注意南开的学生，看见一辆大卡车，上面站着一个人，大喊：“同学们注意！我们同学又在新华日报门前被打死两个！”我一听觉得奇怪，便绕道到新华日报去看，完全不是这么回事！反倒是新华日报被特务捣毁得不成样子。在车上喊的人，就是特务，他们组织这种反苏游行，就是打算挑拨国际战争，并想借反苏的口号一并反对共产党，反对民主运动，撕毁政治决议！”
