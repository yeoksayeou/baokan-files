(Our newspaper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch) The Li Zhaoxiang movement in Qin County, which disrupts the distribution of the fruits of struggle, is a powerful symbol of the county's peasants uniting in a "blooming" struggle and carrying out land reform. The traditional fruit distribution method in Qin County was "whoever calculates, gets," but peasants with no accounts to calculate or no issues to raise were shut out of the struggle or automatically withdrew from it. In Wangke Village, more than 40 peasants helped seven peasants with accounts to calculate, and in the end, all the gains went to the seven, while the rest asked to withdraw from the peasants' association. In Xitang Village, only more than 40 peasant households had accounts to calculate, while the actual number of peasants needing emancipation was over a hundred, so the rest continued to live in poverty. When the idea of changing this method was proposed, there were various debates; for example, people with accounts in Beizhang Village still advocated "whoever calculates, gets," while others "without accounts to calculate" advocated distribution according to class background. Later, the hero of emancipation, Li Zhaoxiang, came forward and said: "If we want everyone to be emancipated, we can no longer distribute according to the old way, we should think of a new way." He then proposed a new method of distribution by disrupting the old way. After explaining that everyone's emancipation is what counts, he set an example by distributing his surplus gains to the impoverished, which was supported by all the peasants. They then took him as a new symbol of distributing the fruits of struggle and launched the Li Zhaoxiang movement. Since the launch of the Li Zhaoxiang movement, the mass movement in Qin County has entered a new stage. First, "the number of participants in the struggle has expanded. All the poor peasants in every village have actively participated in the struggle this time. For example, in the four streets of the city, except for those who are being struggled against, no one is not participating in the struggle. Second, the struggle has become faster and more enthusiastic. Previously, adhering to the principle of "whoever calculates, gets" for fruit distribution, the struggle was limited to individual complainants, struggling against one after another, and the struggle often dragged on for a long time, allowing the targets of the struggle to transfer their property. Since breaking the convention of "whoever calculates, gets," there is no fear of messing up the accounts or delaying time, and thus the form of "blooming" has emerged. In the past five months, Jiaokou administrative village had cleared more than 20 households, and this time in ten days, the achievements were almost equal to all the past. Third, the realization of "land to the tiller" has become more reliable. There were more than 30 households in Qingxiu Village who had not been emancipated, 14 in Ni Village, and 11 in Qiangying. The seven villages jointly cleared the big landlords Yang Guoni and Yang Quanbao, and Ni Village cleared more than 900,000 yuan, Qiangying more than 300,000 yuan, and Qingxiu only 100,000 yuan. If distributed according to "whoever calculates, gets," many people would not be able to be emancipated, but thanks to the launch of the Li Zhaoxiang movement, Qingxiu and other villages quickly realized "land to the tiller."

### 确保贫苦农民翻身  沁县打乱分配果实  推动全县农民纷纷参加斗争

　　确保贫苦农民翻身
    沁县打乱分配果实
    推动全县农民纷纷参加斗争
    【本报太岳十六日电】沁县打乱分配斗争果实的李兆祥运动，是全县农民联合“大开花”斗争，进行土地改革的有力标帜。沁县传统的果实分配办法是“谁算谁得”，而无账可算，或无问题可提的农民，则被关在斗争门外，或自动退出斗争。王可村四十余个农民，帮助七个有账的农民算账，最后果实全归七个人，而其余的人便要求退出农会。西堂村有账可算的农民仅四十余户，而实际需要翻身的农民则有百户以上，所以其余人依旧过着贫苦生活。当提出要转变这种办法的时候，曾有过各种争论；例如北漳村有账的人仍主张“谁算谁得”，而另外一些“无账可算”的人，则主张按成份分配，后来翻身英雄李兆祥出来说：“要大家翻身，就不能再按旧盘盘分了，应想个新盘盘”，随即提出用打乱分的新办法。在讲清了大家都翻身才算翻身的道理后，自己作模范，将多得的斗争果实分配给贫苦的人，得到全体农民的拥护，便将他当作分配斗争果实的新标帜，开展了李兆祥运动。自开展李兆祥运动以后，沁县群众运动便进入新的时期，第一“参加斗争的人数扩大，每个村所有的贫穷农民此次均纷纷参加斗争。如城内四街，除被斗争户外，已无一个人不参加斗争。第二、斗争更加迅速和热烈，以前依着“谁算谁得”的果实分配原则，斗争限于个别诉苦人，斗罢一个再斗一个，斗争往往拖延很长，使斗争对象转移了财产，自从打破了“谁算谁得”的成规后，既不怕弄乱了账，又不会拖延时间，于是产生了“大开花”的形式。交口行政村过去五个月中清算过二十余户，此次十天内几乎等于已往的所有成绩。第三、耕者有其田的实现更加可靠了。青修村未翻身户三十余人，倪村十四人，羌营十一人，七村联合清算大地主杨国匿、杨全保，而倪村清算九十余万元，羌营三十余万元，青修仅十万元，如按“谁算谁得”分下来，则使很多人不能翻身，但由于开展了李兆祥运动，使青修等村迅速的实现了耕者有其田。
