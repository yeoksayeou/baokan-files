[This dispatch comes from our newspaper's Taiyue office on the 25th] In Qinyuan, during the examination and implementation of "land to the tiller," many villages first resolved the ideological problems of the cadres, and then were able to smoothly delve into the masses. Zhongyu Village is an old revolutionary base area in Qinyuan. It had experienced many mass movements in the past, but because the cadres' thinking was not aligned, the village had not been able to realize "land to the tiller." Generally, the cadres in this village had held their positions for a long time and felt they had made many contributions, so they didn't care about anything. Secondly, they practiced paternalism and lacked a democratic style. As a result, the cadres were not united and even attacked each other, so they did not pay attention to the work assigned by their superiors… or they were perfunctory. Another reason was that after each campaign, some of the masses expressed dissatisfaction with the cadres, and the district cadres readily criticized them. Some cadres then adopted the attitude of "seeking no merit, but only avoiding mistakes." After the "land to the tiller" directive was communicated, the cadres similarly shirked responsibility and raised many difficulties.

After discovering these problems, the leadership first conducted ideological education among the cadres: (1) At the expanded cadre meeting, the district cadres first made self-criticisms about their leadership, explaining that they had only paid attention to the shortcomings of the village cadres in the past, while neglecting their strengths, and not providing enough assistance in their work. After the cadres' self-criticisms, the village cadres began to recall their past work. The chairman of the peasant association said, "The district cadres can still point out their own shortcomings, are we really completely correct?" So, they one by one examined their undemocratic work style and perfunctory attitude towards work. (2) Explaining the spirit of "one for all" enlightened the cadres' class consciousness. (3) Helping the cadres clearly recognize the targets of the struggle and focus on feudal forces. Discussions were held on who should be struggled against and who should be filled in, and it was explained that as long as the masses were mobilized, there would be no difficulties in the work. (4) To make the cadres truly realize that the superiors were sincerely helping them, the merits of the village cadres were widely publicized among the masses, while pointing out that it was unavoidable for the cadres to have shortcomings in their work.

After aligning the cadres' thinking, the cadres immediately went deep among the masses by household and by section, checking the ideological problems in the implementation of "land to the tiller."

    改善干部群众关系开展团结运动
    区干部自我检讨具体帮助
    中峪村干部转变作风
    【本报太岳二十五日电】沁源在检查实行耕者有其田中，不少村子先解决干部思想问题，然后即可通行无阻的深入到群众中去。中峪村为沁源老区，曾经多年群众运动，但因干部思想未通，致使该村一直未能实现耕者有其田，该村一般干部担任工作时间较长，自觉功劳不少，凡事不在乎。其次是包办代替，缺少民主作风，因此干部不团结，甚至互相攻击，因此对于上级所布置工作不重视……或敷衍塞责。另一原因是以前每经一次工作之后，部分群众对干部反映不满，区干部轻易批评，有些干部便抱着：“不求有功，单求无过”的态度，此次传达实行耕者有其田后，干部同样推诿不负责任，提出许多困难。
    领导上发现这些问题后，首先在干部中进行思想教育：（一）在扩干会议上先由区干部自我检讨领导，说明了以前仅注意村干部的缺点，而忽视优点，工作中帮助不够；经过干部检讨后，便引起村干部回忆自己以往的工作，农会主席说：“区干部还能说出自己的缺点，难道我们自己就完全对吗？”于是他们一一检查了自己的不民主作风与敷衍工作态度。（二）解释一人为大家的精神，启发了干部的阶级觉悟。（三）帮助干部明确认识斗争对象，对准封建势力。讨论了谁该斗争，谁该填补，并说明只要将群众发动起来，工作就没有困难。（四）是为使干部真正认识上级是诚心诚意的帮助他们，并广泛的在群众中宣传村部部的功劳，同时指出干部在工作中有缺点是不可避免的。
    打通干部思想以后，随即由干部分门按户的深入群众，检查实行耕者有其田中的思想问题。
