    【This Newspaper Dispatches】 According to people from the Taihang First District, the land reform movement in all counties of the district has entered an in-depth stage around the New Year. During the turning point, they universally utilized the experience of large-scale mobilization of poor and hired peasants and uniting with middle peasants since August of last year, using its points as units, to convene mass meetings of hundreds to thousands of poor and hired peasants in nearby villages to collectively pour out grievances, arousing hatred towards feudal forces. Calling on peasants to conduct emancipation inspections, compare present times with the past with landlords, investigate and cut off feudal vestiges, and settle accounts with landlords, the poor and hired peasants, after returning from the meetings, united with all middle peasants to settle accounts with the landlords family by family, calculating how they made their fortunes in the past, how they harmed people, how they stubbornly resisted during the mass struggle, how they sabotaged, and how they are doing now. Those who were generally recognized as having no problems and had lowered their heads were given appropriate consideration; those who were believed to still be hiding land and property, or were still secretly active and plotting to overturn the verdict, were subjected to struggle, their feudal vestiges were cut off, and their sabotage activities were exposed. As of around the 13th, most of the backward villages, feudal fortresses, left over from the past in the counties, accounting for 20 to 30 percent, had been broken open, and feudal remnants had been cleared from general villages, and many facts of special agent sabotage by landlords had been pursued, exposing their true colors to the masses. The district is located along the Pinghan Railway, and the movement is closely combined with war preparedness. In Xingtai, Zanhuang and other counties, some villages implemented war preparedness for men (hiding grain, transporting, etc.), and struggle by women and the elderly. Landlords who had plotted to cooperate with the Chiang army's northward counter-offensive against the peasants were suppressed by the masses and disappeared. The counties are now actively continuing to fill gaps and make improvements, preparing to completely finish the land reform before spring plowing. Neiqiu and other counties have completed land reform in villages and have held forums for landlords, guiding them to review their past mistakes of oppressing and defrauding peasants and denying compensation, and providing necessary care for small and medium landlords. Some landlords have resolved to follow the path of Zhang Yongtai, to become rich through labor.

    太行一分区发动雇贫团结中农
    各县普遍转向深入
    争取春耕前彻底完成土地改革
    【本报讯】据太行一分区来人谈，该分区各县土地改革运动均已于新年前后转入深入阶段。转湾时，普遍发挥去年八月以来大规模发动贫雇、团结中农的经验，以其点为单位，召集附近村庄数百至一千人的贫雇农大会集中诉苦，激发对封建势力的仇恨。号召农民进行翻身检查，与地主比时光，查割封建尾巴，给地主算总账，贫雇农开会回去，即团结所有中农，给地主一户一户算，算他从前怎样发了财，怎样坑了人，群众斗争期间怎样顽抗，怎样破坏，直至现在怎样。大家公认为没了问题低了头的，即进行适当照顾；认为还有隐蔽土地财产、或还在暗中活动、图谋翻案的，即展开斗争，割除其封建尾巴，揭发其破坏行为。截至十三号左右，各县过去遗留的百分之二十至三十的落后村，封建堡垒已大部突开，一般村庄也已扫清封建残余，并追出不少地主的特务破坏事实，使其原形毕露于群众之前。该分区地处平汉沿线，运动是与备战密切结合着的。邢台、赞皇等县有好些村庄，实行男子备战（藏粮转运等）、女人与老人斗争。曾谋配合蒋军北上向农民反攻的地主，均遭群众的镇压而敛迹。各县现在积极继续填平补齐，准备于春耕前彻底完成土地改革。内邱等县已完成土地改革村庄，并已举行地主座谈会，引导他们检讨过去欺压讹诈农民与抵赖赔偿之错误，对中小地主实行必要之照顾。若干地主已决心走张永泰道路，劳动发家。
