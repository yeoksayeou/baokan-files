Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th. Yan's troops, invading from several locations in Jinzhong, were again annihilated by a thousand. From December 10th to 27th, Yan's troops from Xin County and Yangqu County continuously attacked Shuiyu Town, 20 miles southeast of Xin County, and Xia Zhuang Village, 30 miles south of Xiaodian in northwestern Yangqu, but were repelled by the local Eighth Route Army and local corps, resulting in over 220 invading Yan soldiers killed or wounded, and 361 captured alive. Furthermore, the 47th and 43rd divisions of Yan's army in Fenyang, a total of six regiments, invaded the northwestern liberated area of Fenyang on December 7th, but were defeated after over a hundred were annihilated by the local Eighth Route Army. A certain unit of the Eighth Sub-district also annihilated over 230 invading Yan soldiers in Xiangzhuangtou and other places north of Jiaocheng on December 13th.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Jin Front, 6th. After the complete annihilation of the 67th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan troops in Puxian County, Dong Zhao regrouped his remnants to reinforce Puxian. Fierce fighting has unfolded in recent days on the 150-li front between Daning, Puxian, and Heilongguan. American-made Chiang's aircraft also took turns assisting in the battle; the artillery fire was fierce, like thunder. At dusk on New Year's Day, the brave soldiers of the Eighth Route Army launched a counterattack under the cover of artillery fire, and in just 40 minutes occupied all the surrounding highlands outside Puxian County, killing and capturing more than 400 of Hu's troops. On the 2nd, our army ambushed two regiments of the invading Chiang's 90th Division at Zhangjiata, 20 miles southeast of Xi County. After fierce fighting all day, Chiang's troops suffered heavy casualties, and on the 3rd, they sneaked into the already isolated city of Puxian. On the same day, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army intercepted Hu's transport team at Daxiao Huiru, 40 miles south of Daning, and seized part of its military supplies. Guerrilla forces of the Eighth Route Army operate day and night on both sides of the Lin (Fen) Pu (Xian) Highway, and Hu's long supply line is often cut off.
