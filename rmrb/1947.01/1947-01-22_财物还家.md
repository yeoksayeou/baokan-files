　　Possessions Returned Home
    (Sketch from the Exhibition Hall of Turned-Over Fruits in Chengguan, Lingchuan)
    Hua Hui
    On New Year's Day, the weather was as warm as spring. People flocked in droves to the venue celebrating the victory of our liberation. Every face was full of smiles, and stories were being performed on the spacious venue.
    The meeting began. People first paid respects to the families of those resisting the enemy, then exchanged New Year's greetings with each other, followed by a report on current affairs and a summary of the liberation. After the report, crowds poured into the Exhibition Hall of Turned-Over Fruits in batches. Inside the hall, on a row of tables on the right, copper coins were arranged to form the six large characters "Celebrating the Victory of Liberation"; on the three tables on the left were filled with tin and copper sacrificial utensils. Pleasant music was being played in the corridor, coming from the gramophone seized from the home of the traitor Du Mingfu.
    Entering the silver dollar and silverware exhibition room, it was dazzling. Round ingots and glittering silver dollars were arranged on four square tables to form the words "Fruits of the Liberation Struggle." The back row of tables was filled with jewelry. A woman stood in front of the table with earrings, exclaiming, "I've never even seen them before, let alone worn them." In the northeast corner of the room, there was a machine gun, several rifles with bayonets, and many hand grenades, all purchased with silver dollars won through struggle. The liberated peasants are using them to protect the fruits of victory!
    Turning through a wall door, groups of yellow cattle and black donkeys were tied there. An old man was carefully examining an old ox, saying, "Getting this one, it will be really useful for plowing!" He then counted carefully: "Oh my! Forty-eight of them!"
    Further inside, in a large courtyard, two long ropes were crossed high up, with colorful silk robes and satin jackets fluttering above. Beside that antique floral blue satin jacket, an old lady said to herself, "If I had this outfit to wear when I get old, that would be great!" The women were all carefully examining these beautiful clothes, their faces revealing joy, because these things would all belong to them.
    In addition, there were lacquered red tables, stools, chairs, cabinets, and farm tools, grain sacks, clothing… crowding the exhibition room. People were going in and out, in a constant stream, admiring and discussing: "These are really good things!" "The damned landlords really knew how to enjoy themselves!" "These were originally taken from us by the landlords, and now they should be returned to us!"
    As I walked out of the entrance of the exhibition hall, I saw that the faces of those who had just come out were as red and bright as if they had just drunk a few cups of wine. Yes, their hearts were full of joy, they had received the wine of the fruits of victory.

　　财物还家
    （陵川城关翻身果实展览馆速写）
    华惠
    元旦那天，天气和暖得像春天一样，人们成群结队，涌进庆祝翻身胜利的会场。每一张脸上都挂满了笑容，故事在宽阔的会场上表演着。
    大会开始了，人们首先给抗属行礼，然后互相团拜，接着是时事报告和翻身总结。报告完毕，人群一批批的涌进翻身果实展览馆。馆内右边一排桌上用铜元摆成了“庆祝翻身胜利”六个大字；左边三个桌上摆满了锡铜供器。走廊里正放送着悦耳的音乐，这是从汉奸杜明甫家中搜出来的那架留声机里发出来的。
    走进银元银器展览室，琳琅满屋，团团的元宝，白花花的现洋在四张方桌上摆成了“翻身斗争果实”的字样。后一排桌上全是手饰。一个妇女站在摆有耳坠子的桌前，赞叹地说：“咱见也没见过呀，不用说戴了。”靠东北角的桌上，放着一挺机枪，几支插有刺刀的步枪和好些手榴弹，这都是用斗争出来的银元买的。翻身农民用它们保卫着胜利果实！
    拐过一个墙门，成群的黄牛和黑驴在那里拴着，一个老汉正在端详着一只老犍说：“分到这头，犁地可顶事啦！”他又认真地数了数：“哎呀！四十八头哩！”
    再往里走，一个大院里两条长绳十字交叉高高扯起，上面飘动着五颜六色的绸袍缎袄。在那件古式团花蓝缎袄旁边，一个老太太自言自语地说：“我要有这一身衣服装老就好了！”女人们都在端详着这些漂亮的衣服，脸上流露着喜悦，因为这些东西将都属于她们。
    此外，还有油漆红桌、凳、椅、柜和农具、粮袋、衣物………把展览室里挤得满满的。人们出来进去，川流不息，边瞧边赞赏着议论着：“可是些好东西哩！”“狗日的老财真会享福！”“这些原本是老财们刮走咱们的，现在又该拿来还给咱们啦！”
    当我走出展览馆的门口，我看见那些刚走出来的人们，脸上都像刚喝过几盅酒似的，又红又亮。是的，他们的心里充满了欢悦，他们已得到了胜利果实的酒浆。
