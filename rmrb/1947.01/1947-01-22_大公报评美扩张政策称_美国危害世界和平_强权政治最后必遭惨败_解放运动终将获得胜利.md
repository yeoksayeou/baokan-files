　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Peiping dispatch: Tianjin Ta Kung Pao published an article on the 15th entitled "International Trends and China," criticizing the U.S. expansionist policy. The newspaper believes that the establishment of U.S. "bases in foreign countries only endangers the peace of the masses and cannot guarantee its own security. If Hitler had not intended to annex Czechoslovakia and Poland, he would never have brought self-destruction upon himself. Japan harbored evil intentions, coveted China's Northeast, and swallowed a bomb that led to its own demise. Therefore, we can conclude that power politics and expansionist ambitions have only one outcome: self-destruction." The newspaper pointed out that the combination of U.S. monopoly capital and power politics, coupled with the surge in the U.S. labor movement and the situation where "economic depression may come in the near future," means that "its ultimate defeat is only a matter of time." The newspaper concludes: "The current course of international development is clearly following an irresistible trend. Although power politics is strong, it will ultimately be washed away by this trend. Although liberation movements are arduous and difficult, they will ultimately flow thousands of miles along this trend. All right-leaning conservatives are broken boats with severed cables and will ultimately drown. The forces of progress will also be washed and eliminated by the front and back waves, flowing into the ocean of freedom and democracy."

　　大公报评美扩张政策称
    美国危害世界和平
    强权政治最后必遭惨败
    解放运动终将获得胜利
    【新华社延安十九日电】北平讯：天津大公报十五日撰论“国际潮流与中国”抨击美国扩张政策。该报认为，美国“一国在国外基地的建立惟有危害大众的和平，却毫不能保障自己的安全。希特勒要不是为了吞并捷克和波兰，决不致自招焚身。日本包藏祸心，觊觎中国的东北，以致吞了一颗招致本身灭亡的大炸弹。故我们可以断定，强权政治和扩张的野心只有一个下场，那就是自身毁灭。”该报指出：美国垄断资本与强权政治的结合力量，在美国劳工运动的高涨与“经济萧条在不久将来即可能来到”的情形下，“它的最后被击破也只是时间问题。”该报结论称：“目前国际发展的进程显然是跟着一个不可抗御的潮流前进。强权政治虽坚强，最后还要被这股潮流冲走。解放运动虽坚苦艰难，最后将顺着这个潮流一泻千里，一切右倾的保守派是断缆的破舟，最后是要沉溺的。前进的势力也将经过前浪与后浪的冲刷与淘汰，而流到自由与民主的海洋。”
