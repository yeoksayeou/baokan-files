[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Headquarters of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has issued a public communiqué on the entire region's Patriotic Self-Defense War over the past year, as follows:

After the Kuomintang and the Communist Party jointly issued a ceasefire order on January 13, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army strictly observed the ceasefire order, carrying out tasks such as troop consolidation and demobilization, leveling fortifications, and repairing transportation in the stationed areas. However, the Kuomintang army completely disregarded the ceasefire order, deploying troops and generals every day, building bunkers and repairing walls (on the Anyang-Xinxiang section of the Pinghan Railway alone, more than 300 bunkers were built, averaging one wall per mile; bunkers in roadside villages were not included in this calculation), and constantly launching attacks on our border areas. According to incomplete statistics, from January 13 to the end of June, the Kuomintang army and the puppet troops under its direction launched more than 2,200 attacks on the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, once occupying Meng County, and seizing 1,431 of our villages and towns, covering a total area of more than 19,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 700,000.

In order to strive for national peace, we repeatedly exercised restraint. However, the Kuomintang army was determined to sell out the motherland and strangle the cause of independence, peace, and democracy of the Chinese people, tearing up all the solemn resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. In mid-July, it dispatched 20 divisions and 49 brigades to launch a large-scale all-out offensive against our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area. The soldiers and civilians of our entire region, in order to defend the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, defend the fruits of victory, and defend our hometowns, had no choice but to take up their own weapons and carry out a patriotic self-defense war.

Now, the results of the entire region's self-defense war over the past year (up to December 20) are comprehensively announced as follows (the battle achievements of the militia are not included in the calculation):
