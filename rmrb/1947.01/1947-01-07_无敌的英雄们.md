    The Invincible Heroes
    Ke Lan, Tang Luo
    Comrade Wang Zhen's 359th Brigade marched south to fight the Japanese in 1944 and was heavily surrounded by stubborn troops along the way. They victoriously broke through in October last year and arrived in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Here are some short stories about them on the road.
  I. No Road Left
    Wang Zhen's troops had only eaten one meal of pumpkin in three days, and were now resting in a deep gully in Bamian Mountain, utterly exhausted. A scout ran over to report: "The enemy has blocked all the passes out of the mountains. We have no way out. The situation is very dangerous..." Wang Huzi (i.e. Comrade Wang Zhen) said: "Is there no other way?" "No, there isn't!" the scout said. "The mountains are too steep and full of big trees, impossible to climb out." Wang Huzi said: "Don't worry! The people's army will not be trapped here." Immediately he ordered everyone to find the locals and ask for directions. Indeed, the people love the people's army. An old man in his eighties, with snow-white hair and beard, walked over with a cane. He said: "Comrades! There is a small path on that high mountain that can get you out, but it's hard to walk. I only went up there twice to collect medicine in my life, and that was more than twenty years ago." Wang Zhen looked at the mountain peak piercing the clouds and ordered: "Send a company with broadswords to go ahead and cut out that path!" And so, the troops broke through.
  II. Tearing Trousers
    The heavy rain poured down, soaking the troops like drowned chickens. Mud and water filled the gun barrels, turning machine guns into mud sticks, and grenades into water eggs. After crossing a mountain range, Chiang's troops blocked the way. A soldier shouted: "Company commander! Enemies ahead!" "Fight!" the company commander ordered. "Put the machine gun on the high ground in front!" As the machine gun was set up, the soldier shouted again: "The gun barrel is full of water, it won't fire. Our clothes are all wet, and we have no dry cloth to wipe it." The company commander pulled down his trousers, tore off the crotch, and said: "Damn it! Are we afraid of this difficulty? Here's a piece of dry cloth for you." The machine gunner took the crotch cloth, wiped the gun, and the machine gun started roaring, defeating the enemy's attack.
  III. Camping
    Comrade Wang Zhen was listening to a scout's report under an old tree that the enemy had blocked the pass, and his spirits lifted slightly. Then his eyelids slowly drooped again, he hadn't had a good night's sleep in seven or eight days... At this time, it was getting dark, and Comrade Wang Zhen said:
    "Let's camp here! We dare to sleep right next to the wolf's den." The exhausted soldiers fell to the ground and slept soundly. Holding their guns in their arms, with their legs bent, they lay there in a chaotic jumble. Comrade Wang Zhen, a brigade commander of the Eighth Route Army, did not sleep. He walked around the soldiers, his eyes fixed on the enemy-occupied mountain in front, preparing for the enemy.

    无敌的英雄们
    柯蓝  汤洛
    王震同志率领的三五九旅，于四四年南下抗日，途中被顽固军队重重包围，去年十月胜利突围到达陕甘宁边区，下面是他们在路上的一些小故事。
  一、没有路了
    王震部队三天只吃了一顿南瓜，现在歇在八面山的深沟里，大家十分疲惫。侦察员跑来报告说：“敌人把几个出去的山口子都堵住了，咱们没有路出山。情况很危险………”王胡子（即王震同志）说：“再没有旁的路子吗？”“再没有了！”侦察员说：“山太陡，又是大树，爬不出去。”王胡子说：“不怕！人民的军队不会被困死在这里的。”马上他命令了大家去找老百姓问路。真的，老百姓是疼爱人民军队的。一个八十多岁的老头子，头发胡子花白花白的，拉了根拐杖走过来了，他说：“同志！那边高山上有一条小路可以出去，只是不好走，我这一辈也只上去采过两回药，于今二十多年不走了。”王震望着那插入云空的山峰，命令说：“派一个连拿大刀走前面，砍出那条路来！”就这样，部队突围出来了。
  二、扯裤裆
    白雨哗啦啦的下，队伍淋的像水鸡，枪筒里灌进了泥水，机关枪变成了泥棒棒，手榴弹也变成了水鸡蛋，翻过一架山，蒋军挡住了去路，战士叫道：“连长！前边发现了敌人！”“打！”连长命令道：“机关枪架到前面高地去！”机关枪架起来了，战士又叫道：“枪筒里灌了水，打不响，衣服全是湿的，没有干布没法擦。”连长把裤子往下一脱，扯下裤裆说：“他妈的！怕这困难吗？给你块干布。”机关枪射手接过裤裆布，擦了枪，机枪便叫起来了，打垮了敌人的进攻。
  三、宿营
    王震同志在一棵老树底下听一个侦察员报告：敌人已经堵住了山口，他的精神振作了一下。接着眼皮又慢慢垂了下来，他一连有七八天没有睡过好觉了…………这时天色已经快黑了，王震同志说：
    “咱们在这里宿营吧！咱们就敢在狼窝跟前睡觉。”疲乏的战士们一倒在地上就睡得呼呼的了。两手抱着枪，屈着腿，一个一个乱七八糟的躺着，王震同志，是八路军的一个旅长，他没有睡。他一个人在战士们的周围走来走去，两眼望着前面那扎有敌人的山头，他在防备着敌人。
