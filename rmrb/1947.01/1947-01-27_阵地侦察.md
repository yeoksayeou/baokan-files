    Terrain Reconnaissance
    勇进  西良
    On the fourth day of attacking Liaocheng, the enemies in the city were still stubbornly defending the solid castle. An attack was planned for the night, and each unit was reconnoitering the terrain for their respective assaults. The reconnaissance mission for the east gate fell to the first company of the first battalion of the × regiment. The three-hero, Jin Qingying, cheerfully volunteered. He was from Renping, and in August, he was still the village's farmers' association chairman. He had only been in the army for two months, and this was only his second time participating in combat. With a red and chubby face and a stocky build, his peasant background couldn't be hidden by his uniform. Platoon leader Guo Zhenyang assigned him the task of reconnoitering whether there were any enemies in the bunker on the right side of the city gate and counting how many gun holes there were at the base of the city wall. After accepting the mission, he turned and headed to the front lines. From our position to the base of the city wall was about a hundred meters, separated by a moat and an old trench. Three low bunkers were hidden under the right armpit of the city gate. At first, Jin Qingying was a little scared because he knew the enemy in the city was vicious, but then he remembered his hometown had been harmed, and he joined the army to avenge the people, so his heart settled down, and his eyes brightened. He took grenades and quietly crawled out of the position, rolled across the not-very-thick ice, and found no enemies in the old trench, but there were three rows of barbed wire. He used grenades to clear them away, crawled underneath, tearing his clothes. Not far past the barbed wire, he found a landmine buried there. The mine's pull cord was as thick as a finger. He bit it hard with his teeth, ignoring the toothache and without spitting out the dirt in his mouth, he continued to crawl forward, but he encountered another landmine. The mine's cord was even thicker. He bit it several times, but there was no hope of biting it through, and time was running out. He simply pulled it, detonating it. This was terrible; the enemy was alerted and threw flares down the wall three times in a row, but fortunately, they were all extinguished by our artillery. He lay still, holding his breath, and continued to crawl forward after the enemy quieted down. When he crawled close to the first bunker, it had already been destroyed by our artillery, and no one was inside. He crawled close to the second bunker, not alerting the enemy. He lay down and carefully listened with his ear to the bunker. Someone inside was panting heavily. He heard uneven breaths, determining it wasn't just one person, so he bit open the pins of two grenades and stuffed them into the bunker. Then he jumped in front of the third bunker, finding cover between two gun holes. But after the grenades exploded in the second bunker, the third bunker didn't fire a single shot. It turned out the enemy had retreated into the city and started shooting from the city wall. By this time, he was close to the base of the wall, cleared the gun holes and surveyed the terrain, and began to crawl back. When he crawled back to the edge of the trench, the two hundred catties of yellow explosives under the city gate suddenly detonated. Although he was twenty meters away, he was buried under broken bricks. He passed out, but regained consciousness after a minute or two. He knew that he had reached the final stage of his mission and couldn't delay, so he tried his best to push away the bricks and dirt, and continued to crawl back, but his body was as weak as if it had no bones, and his mind was like a dream. Suddenly, someone carried him and crawled. It turned out to be platoon leader Guo Zhenyang who had come to meet him. When he returned to his position, he reported the results of the reconnaissance. When the doctor undid his uniform, there were fifteen wounds bleeding. He smiled and said, "It's nothing, just some minor injuries."

    阵地侦察
    勇进  西良
    攻打聊城的第四天，城里的敌人还是死守着坚固的城堡，晚上要进攻，各部队都侦察自己登城的地形，东门的侦察任务落在×团一营一连里，三英雄金庆英愉快的报了名。他是荏平人，八月间还是村里的农会会长，从参军到现在才只两个月，而且这才是第二次参加斗争。红胖的脸色，粗短身材，军装掩不了他庄稼人的本相，班长郭振扬交代给他的任务，是侦察城门右边地堡里有无敌人，数清城根下有多少枪眼；他接受任务后，扭头就走向最前的阵地。从我们阵地到城根有百来米远，中间隔着一道城壕，一道旧战沟，低低地三个地堡在城门的右腋下隐藏着。最初金庆英也有些害怕，因为他知道城里敌人的狠毒，但是他一转念想起自己的家乡被害，自己来参军就是为人民报仇，心便定下来，眼也明亮了，他带了手榴弹悄悄地爬出阵地，在并不很厚的冰上滚过去，在旧战沟里并没有敌人，但是有三道铁蒺藜，他用手榴弹把它弄开，从下面钻过去，衣服都被撕破了，过去铁蒺藜不远，他发现有一个地雷埋在那里，雷的拉绳像手指样粗，他狠命用牙把它咬断，不顾牙疼，也不吐吐嘴里的泥土，他仍向前爬，可是又碰上一个地雷，雷绳更粗，他咬了几下，没有咬断的希望，而时间也不允许，他索性就把它拉响了，这一下多糟糕，敌人惊动起来，接连三次向城下抛火照明，好在都被我们的炮手准备的打灭了。他屏息地躺着，等敌人安静后又继续向前爬动，他爬近第一个地堡时，那地堡已被我们的炮打垮，里面已没人了，又爬近第二个，也没有惊动敌人，他就伏着身体把耳朵贴在地堡上仔细听，里边有人在呼呼地喘气，他听到粗细不匀，断定不是一个人，就咬开两个手榴弹的盖子，一并塞在地堡里，接着就跳在第三个地堡跟前，在两个枪眼之间找到隐蔽，但是在第二地堡里的手榴弹轰响后，第三地堡也并没打出子弹来，原来敌人已缩进城里去，在城墙上打起枪来。这时他已接近墙根，清查了枪眼和地形，开始爬回来。当他爬回战沟边的时候，城门下的二百斤黄色炸药忽然响了，他虽在二十米外，也被破砖压住了，他晕过去了，但一两分钟后又恢复了知觉，他知道自己交待任务已到最后的时候了，不允许耽误，于是竭力推下身上的砖土，又继续爬回，但是身体像没了筋骨样的软弱，脑里也像做梦一样，忽然有一个人抱着他爬，原来是班长郭振扬来接他，回到自己的阵地，他报告了侦察的结果，医生解开他的军装时，有十五处伤口在流血，他笑着说：“没啥，都是些轻伤。”
