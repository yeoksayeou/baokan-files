　　To provide more timely guidance for comprehensive work and to more richly reflect the reality of the Ji'nan area, the Ji'nan District Party Committee has decided to change the Ji'nan Daily to a daily publication, starting from New Year's Day this year. In its inaugural message for the change, the newspaper called on all Party comrades and the broad readership in Ji'nan to work together to fulfill the tasks of the Party newspaper. It pointed out that every worker in the newspaper office must further and specifically clarify the concept of serving the masses from concrete problems, concrete methods, and concrete requirements, and constantly pay attention to the central work of the time, closely integrating with actual movements. To this end, the newspaper must in the future provide more services to the broad readership and the thousands of correspondents, so that readers feel that they are not only readers of the newspaper, but also masters of the newspaper, and that correspondents feel that they are the mothers nurturing the newspaper.
