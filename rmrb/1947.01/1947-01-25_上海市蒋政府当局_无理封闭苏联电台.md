Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd. The Shanghai authorities closed the "Voice of the Soviet Union" radio station run by Soviet merchants in Shanghai on January 6th. The radio station had broadcast the truth about China's war of resistance in Chinese, Russian, English, and German, and carried out much cultural work. The closure of the radio station has caused dissatisfaction and regret among Chinese cultural circles and scientists. The North China Daily News stated: The decision in this matter should take into account the fact that for a long time, Chinese and Allied expatriates in Shanghai received communiques about the progress of the war through Soviet radio stations, which carried out many struggles against enemy German and Japanese propaganda. This contribution to the Allied cause should not be forgotten. Progressive people in Shanghai believe that the closure of the Soviet radio station is a serious blow to the friendly cultural ties between China and the Soviet Union, and is closely linked to the reactionary forces' intensified suppression of Chinese democrats.

　　上海市蒋政府当局
    无理封闭苏联电台
    【新华社延安二十三日电】上海当局于一月六日封闭苏商在上海办的“苏联呼声”电台。该电台曾用中俄英德四种文字广播关于中国抗战的真象，并进行了许多文化工作。封闭该电台，在中国文化界与科学家中间引起不满与惋惜。字林西报称：此事之决定应注意到这一事实：即在长时期内上海的中国人与盟国侨民都是经过苏联电台得到关于战争进程公报的，它与敌人德日宣传进行了许多斗争，这种对盟国事业的贡献，是不应当忘记的。上海进步人士认为，封闭苏联电台是对于中苏文化友好联系一严重的打击，与反动势力加强对中国民主人士的压迫有密切连系。
