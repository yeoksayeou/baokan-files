    During the Spring Festival, No More Burning Incense to Worship Gods
    JiYuan Peasants All Respect Chairman Mao as a Living Immortal
    Chairman Mao's Portraits Are Eagerly Purchased by Everyone in Yangcheng City
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 25th] More than 100,000 peasants in Jiyuan, after land reform, have an unprecedentedly improved level of awareness, and feudal superstitions are being gradually eliminated. "Respecting living gods and not dead gods" has become the action slogan for most peasants to celebrate the New Year. Zhao Chuan-dao from Wei Yuan Village said happily: "We have been worshiping clay statues for generations, and we have been poor for generations. This year we have land and houses, which were given by Chairman Mao. I think we should invite Chairman Mao to sit on our divine throne!" In many villages, the masses have composed couplets and pasted them on their doors: "Respect Chairman Mao, the living god, who brings back gold and silver treasures; Do not respect the red tablet, only spending gold and silver without return." Most villages in the county do not buy incense or yellow paper for the New Year... At the markets in Wushan, Chaomen Street, Shangzhuang, and other places, the sellers of superstitious items have decreased by eight-tenths, while portraits of Chairman Mao are in short supply. Some people cannot buy them and ask school teachers to draw them. Peasants use the money they save from not buying superstitious items to buy more meat for the New Year. For example, in Wei Yuan Village, with more than 1,100 households, each person ate more than one jin of meat on average. (Wei Jin)
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 25th] The lunar New Year in Yangcheng after land reform is full of new atmosphere. The emancipated peasants are vying to buy portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The Xinhua Bookstore retail department alone has sold more than 4,000 copies in half a month. A small stall's "Lord Zao" (kitchen god) is difficult to sell. Old calendars are priced at 160 yuan, and new calendars are 180 yuan, but the emancipated peasants are willing to spend 20 yuan more to buy new ones. On the 28th, twelve new ones were sold, and only one old one was sold. The next best business is the four bathhouses and butcher shops. Emancipated peasants from all directions crowd to take baths every day. Zhang Xiao-quan said after taking a bath: "I have never taken a bath since I was a child. This year, I will also be hygienic." The eighteen large and small butcher shops in the four gates of the city slaughter ninety pigs and hundreds of sheep every day, which are in short supply, exceeding any previous year. Bi Jin-chuan, a family member of a soldier who was emancipated, was allocated 1.6 mu of irrigated land and five rooms in the land reform. He said happily: "In the past, I had to hide from debts in December. On the night of the thirtieth of the lunar year, there were more than a dozen lanterns on the table, all of which were creditors coming to collect debts. It was really difficult for the poor. This year is the first carefree year of my life." He has cut eight jin of meat and bought six jin of oil. In previous years, the windows were only patched with old paper for the New Year. This year, they have all been replaced with new ones. On the calligraphy and painting of "Purple Qi High Beidou" (auspicious sign), there are portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. He respectfully said: "In previous years, I burned incense and kowtowed at the fifth watch of the New Year. This year, I will pay tribute to Chairman Mao." The couplets on the door read: "Deep plowing and careful cultivation, abundant harvest of grains. Drive away the stubborn army, the country is peaceful and the people are safe." "Democratic life." He said: "This couplet is my work for next year."
    [Changzhi 25th] Before the lunar New Year, the masses who have been emancipated are rushing to prepare New Year's goods, and the market in Zhangnan Town, She County, appears to be particularly lively than usual. On a crowded street, everyone surrounded a small book stall, vying to buy farmer's calendars printed with portraits of Chairman Mao. More than one hundred farmer's calendars were sold out in a short while. A middle-aged peasant surnamed Zhou from Chengnanguan, who did not buy one, said regretfully: "It's really unlucky!" I pointed to the Yin-Yang calendar comparison table on the book stall and asked him: "Why don't you buy this one?" He shook his head and said: "No! There is no Chairman Mao on it!" I asked again: "Why do you have to buy one with Chairman Mao?" His answer was: "I was emancipated by Chairman Mao! In the past, I worshiped the Kitchen God, changing it once a year, burning incense and making offerings every year, but I became poorer year by year. This year, Chairman Mao told me to be emancipated, with food, clothing, and shelter; I have never seen Chairman Mao, I always want to put up Chairman Mao's portrait to express my heart."

    过春节再不烧香敬神
    济源农民都敬毛主席为活神仙
    阳城市上毛主席画像人人争购
    【本报太岳廿五日电】济源经过土地改革的十余万农民觉悟程度空前提高，封建迷信逐被破除。“敬活神不敬死神”已成为大多数农民欢渡新年的行动口号；苇园村赵传道兴高采烈的说：“敬泥像敬了几辈子，辈辈穷，今年有了土地、房屋，是毛主席送来的，我看请毛主席坐在咱的神位上去吧！”许多村庄群众自己编成对联贴在门口：“敬毛主席活神算回金银好东西；不敬那红牌位光出不进花金银。”全县大多数村庄过年不买香、黄表……。武山、朝门街、尚庄等集上，出卖迷信物品者已减少十分之八，而毛主席像则供不应求，有些群众买不上，请学校教员描画。农民将不买迷信品的钱增买了肉食过年，如苇园村一千一百余户，每人平均吃肉一斤多。          （维进）
    【本报太岳二十五日电】土地改革后的阳城旧历年充满着新的气象，翻身农民争着购买毛主席与朱总司令肖像，仅新华书店门市部半月来即消售四千多份，东关一个小摊上的“皂君爷”很难卖出，旧日历售价一百六十元，新日历一百八十元，但翻身农民情愿多化二十块钱购买新的；二十八日这天新的卖了十二本，旧的只卖了一本。其次生意最好的要算四座澡塘和肉铺，四乡翻身农民每日拥挤着去洗澡，张小全洗后说：“从小到大没有洗过澡，今年也卫生卫生。”全城四关十八家大小肉铺，每日要杀九十多口猪，百余只羊，供不应求，超过以往任何一年。翻身军属毕金川，在土地改革中分到水地一亩六、房五间，他高兴的说：“过去我到腊月就得躲账，腊月三十日夜里桌案上放下十几盏灯笼，都是债主来讨账。穷人真是难过，今年是我有生以来第一个放心年”。他已割了八斤肉，买了六斤油，往年过年窗上只补些旧纸，今年全换成新的了，在“紫气高北斗”的字画上，挂着毛主席、朱总司令的像，他恭敬的说：“往年过年五更烧香叩头，今年我要敬献毛主席。”门上的对联写着：“深耕细作，五谷丰登。打走顽军，国泰民安。”“民主生活”。他说：“这对联是我明年的工作。
    【长治廿五日电】旧历年前，翻了身的群众纷纷赶办年货，涉县漳南镇市集显得比往常特别热闹。在一条拥挤不堪的街道上，大家围着一个小书摊，争买印有毛主席像的农家历，一百多张农家历不一会便卖光了。城南关一个姓周的中年农民，没有买上，遗憾的说：“真不凑巧”！我指着书摊上摆着的阴阳历对照表问他说：“你为什么不买这个呢？”他摆着头说：“不！那上面没有毛主席”！我又问：“你为什非买有毛主席的呢”？他的回答是：“俺是靠毛主席翻了身的！从前俺供养灶君爷，一年换一次，年年烧香上供，俺却一年比一年穷，今年毛主席叫俺翻了身，有吃有穿有住处；没见过毛主席俺总想把毛主席的像贴起来，表表俺的心。”
