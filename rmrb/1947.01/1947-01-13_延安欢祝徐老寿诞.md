　　Yan'an Celebrates Comrade Xu's Birthday
    Chairman Mao presented Comrade Xu with a birthday cake with joy and sincerity; Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: We must continuously learn from Comrade Xu's excellent work style. Comrade Xu said: Young students in the KMT-controlled areas are vigorously promoting the birth of a New China, and we old folks must keep pace with them.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] Yesterday was Comrade Xu Teli's seventieth birthday. People from all walks of life in Yan'an and Chinese and foreign guests went to the Shou Hall of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to congratulate Comrade Xu. Guests crowded to view the colorful birthday banners, congratulatory messages, and gifts. Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Xu's student, and picture cards and labor from elementary school students in various places were presented with joy and sincerity to Comrade Xu, including a birthday cake. The congratulatory messages from Lu Dingyi and Chen Boda said: "A steely hero in times of difficulty and setbacks, a loving mentor to the people." This portrays the great content of Comrade Xu's life. The congratulatory message from all the faculty and students of the Xingzhi Middle School, signed with hundreds of names, wrote: "Millions of young people have become revolutionary leaders and heroic fighters because of your cultivation. Your glorious achievements will be immortalized in history!" Mr. Tian Han, a famous playwright who had received Comrade Xu's education, also brought cordial congratulations from faraway Shanghai. More than a hundred celebrities from the cultural and educational circles in Shanghai also briefly expressed their respect on red paper. When Mr. Fang Wenzhu, a 72-year-old county chief from Chishui, shook hands with him to congratulate him, he said with firm confidence: "Living to be a hundred, we can also see a happier society!" Indeed, this is very possible. According to Comrade Xu Qian (his daughter-in-law), who has served Comrade Xu for several years: "Comrade Xu has a very regular life. He gets up early every morning to exercise and keep fit. He climbs mountains and rivers, and his pace is better than ordinary people. He likes to eat coarse grains, miscellaneous grains and vegetables, and can work and study continuously for up to ten hours."
    At 7 pm, after the birthday banquet, the auditorium was brightly lit, and birthday banners were dazzling. After Comrade Chen Shaoyu announced the start of the birthday celebration, Commander-in-Chief Zhu delivered a congratulatory speech. He said: "Comrade Xu's seventy years of life from China's feudal society to the revolutionary era have forged him into a model revolutionary educator and scientist. As early as the Jiangxi Soviet area, he integrated with workers, peasants, and soldiers to promote Marxist ideology and style. We must celebrate his 70th birthday by continuously learning from Comrade Xu's excellent work style." Then Professor Chen Jinkun, a famous jurist, delivered a speech, praising Comrade Xu's sincere attitude and pure heart; and said that this is the new morality of a revolutionary who serves the people, and should be a model for us to learn from. Amidst prolonged applause, Comrade Xu walked briskly onto the stage to express his gratitude. He first thanked the Party and everyone for their sincerity, and then recounted that in this new era, many old people are following the times like young people, while countless young people are also being tempered to be stronger and more capable in the tide of the times. Finally, this old educator of the people excitedly told everyone: "Now hundreds of thousands of young students in the KMT-controlled areas are vigorously promoting the birth of a New China, and we old folks must keep pace with them." After the speech, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra performed birthday flower drums and joining-the-army yangko, and the Heping Opera House performed "Dumu Pass" and other performances to add to the fun.

　　延安欢祝徐老寿诞
    毛主席以愉快诚挚的心情给徐老送了一块寿糕；朱总司令说：我们要不断学习徐老的优良作风。徐老说：蒋管区内青年学生正在轰轰烈烈推动新中国诞生，我们老者也要和他们齐头并进。
    【新华社延安十一日电】昨日为徐特立同志七十寿辰，延安各界人士及中外宾客纷纷前往中共中央办公厅寿堂向徐老祝寿。宾客们摩肩接踵地参观着彩色缤纷的寿幛、祝词、贺礼，徐老的学生毛泽东同志和各地小学生所送的画片和劳作一样，以愉快诚挚的心情给徐老送了一块寿糕。陆定一和陈伯达同志的祝词为：“在困难和挫折时是铁打的硬汉，对于人民是慈爱的导师。”描绘出了徐老伟大的生活内容。签着数百名字的行知中学全体教职学员的祝词写着：“千百万青年因为你的陶冶而成为革命的领袖、英雄战士，你光荣的功绩永垂青史！”曾经接受徐老教益的名剧作家田汉先生还从遥远的上海带来了亲切的祝词，百余位上海文化教育界名流也在红纸上简示着他们的敬意。当七二老人赤水县长房文祝先生和他拉手祝贺时，他以坚决的信心说：“活到一百，我们也能看到更幸福的社会了！”的确，这是很可能的。据侍奉徐老数年的徐乾同志（他的儿媳）说：“徐老生活很有规律，每天晨起早操健身，翻山越河，健步胜于常人。他爱吃粗食杂粮和蔬菜，工作读书可连续达十小时。”
    晚七时，在寿筵以后，大礼堂内灯火辉煌，寿幛琳琅。陈绍禹同志宣布开始祝寿典礼后，即由朱总司令致祝词。他说：“徐老从中国的封建社会到革命时代的七十年生活中，使他锻炼成为一位模范的革命教育家和科学家。早在江西苏区时，他就和工农兵打成一片，宣传马克思主义的思想与作风。我们要以不断学习徐老的优良作风，来庆贺他的七十大寿。”继由名法学家陈瑾琨教授致词，他颁扬徐老为人态度真挚及心情纯洁；并谓此乃是为人民服务的革命家的新道德，当为吾人学习之榜样。徐老在长久的掌声中健步登台致谢，他首先感谢了党和大家的诚意，并历述当此新的时代里，不少老人似青年般的跟着时代前进，同时无数青年也在时代的浪潮里锻炼得更加坚强而能干。最后，这位人民的老教育家兴奋的告诉大家：“现在蒋管区内几十万青年学生正在轰轰烈烈推动新中国的诞生，我们老者也要和他们齐头并进。”讲话毕即由中央管弦乐团演出祝寿花鼓、参军秧歌，和平剧院演出“独木关”等助兴。
