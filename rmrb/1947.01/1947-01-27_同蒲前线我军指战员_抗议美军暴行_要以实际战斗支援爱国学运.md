    Our Commanders and Fighters on the Tongpu Front
    Protest American Military Atrocities
    Will Use Actual Combat to Support Patriotic Student Movement
    [This Newspaper Taiyue, 25th Dispatch] A certain unit of the Eighth Route Army on the Tongpu front, upon hearing of the American military raping a female student from Peking University on the 14th, aroused the anger of all commanders and fighters. Regarding the increasingly rampant atrocities of the American military in China, they all believe it is a blatant manifestation of America wanting to colonize China. Soldiers in each squad and platoon automatically gathered to discuss the matter. Li Jianwu, a liberated soldier from Meng County, recalling the brutal acts of the American military in Xi'an in 1944 and comparing them to the slavish attitude of the Kuomintang authorities, said angrily: "Although there was a curfew in Xi'an at night, the American military could still pass freely and take advantage of this opportunity to run amok. Who knows what kind of trouble the Americans are causing everywhere now?! We demand that the American military withdraw from China. We are the first to oppose the Kuomintang's condoning of the American military's reckless behavior." Zhang Zhaogan said: "This American action is not only bullying the Chinese people, but also trying to seize the fruits of victory won by the Chinese military and civilians in eight years of resistance against Japan. We must defend the fruits of the anti-Japanese war and make them get out of China!" Everyone unanimously expressed their protest against this lawless atrocity, and pledged to support the student movements in Tianjin, Beijing and other places with actual combat, until the American military gets out of China.

    【本报太岳二十五日电】同蒲前线八路军某部，十四日闻有美军奸淫北大女生事件，激起了全体指战员的愤怒。对于美军在华越演越凶的暴行，均认为是美军要中国殖民地化的露骨表现。各班排的战士，自动集会讨论。孟县解放战士李建武，回忆到三十三年在西安美军的残暴行为，与国民党当局的奴才相，愤怒地说：“在西安夜晚虽然戒严，但美军仍能自由通行，并且趁此机会胡作胡为。现在美国人还不知在各处闹成什么样！？要求美军退出中国，我们首先反对国民党纵容美军胡闹一气。”张照干说：“美国这种行动，不仅欺侮中国的人民，他还要夺取中国军民八年抗战的胜利果实。我们要保卫抗战果实，让他们滚出中国去！”大家一致表示，抗议这种无法无天的暴行，要以实际战斗支援平津各地学生运动，直到美军滚出中国为止。
