    Jinnan Daily Article Calls for Overcoming Complacency and Implementing Land Reform
    [This newspaper's Weixian, 29th dispatch] Jinnan Daily published an editorial, "Overcoming Complacency and Implementing Land Reform," stating: For the past six months, a vigorous land reform movement has been universally launched throughout the Jinnan region. The achievements of this period are significant, but not thorough enough. This requires leaders at all levels, especially at the county and district levels, to conduct in-depth investigation and research with a focus.
    First, we must break the idea of ​​complacency and overestimating achievements. Taking the Fourth District of Ji County as an example, after the masses were greatly mobilized for land reform and then underwent a thorough review of their liberation, it should have been thorough. The county and district leaders initially recognized it this way; however, upon in-depth inspection, some landlords in Zaoyuan still possessed 29 mu of land per person, while some extremely poor peasants only received 1.8 mu of land. This is only in terms of land distribution. In addition, whether the masses' awareness has been truly raised, whether the landlord's rule has been completely overthrown, whether the new and old cadres within the masses are united, etc., all require in-depth investigation and research to find solutions. It must be recognized that thoroughly implementing land reform, fully mobilizing the masses, and ultimately defeating the cunning and stubborn landlord feudal forces is an arduous task.
    Second, leading cadres should go deep down with a focus, not be satisfied with just some statistical materials from district and village cadres. This is the root of complacency. The Ji County and district leaders initially believed that the landlords in the Fourth District had been completely eliminated because they relied on this. This is because lower-level cadres are prone to errors in classifying social strata and neglect backward areas due to the great achievements of the past year.
    Accelerating land reform and striving to complete it thoroughly before spring plowing does not mean that we should act rashly or seek quick results; rather, it requires us to overcome complacency, develop a hardworking, in-depth, and meticulous work style, and strive to completely eliminate feudalism and fully mobilize the masses, so that on this basis, we can turn to large-scale production.

    冀南日报著论号召
    克服麻痹自满
    贯彻土地改革
    【本报威县二十九日电】冀南日报发表“克服麻痹自满，贯彻土地改革”社论称：半年来我冀南全区正普遍开展了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动。这一段的成绩是很大的，但是还不够彻底，这就需要我们各级领导，特别是县区级，有重点的深入调查研究。
    首先必须打破麻痹与过高估计成绩的想法，按冀县四区经过了土地改革的群众大发动，又经过了翻身大检查，应当是彻底的了，县区领导开始就这样认识的；但深入检查起来，枣园地主，有的每人尚保有土地二十九亩，而有的赤贫农仅得到土地一亩八分。这仅从土地的解决而言，此外如群众觉悟是否真正提高，地主统治是否彻底打垮，群众内部新老干部是否团结等等，均需深入调查研究，求得解决。必须认识彻底实行土地改革，充分发动群众，最后的打垮狡猾顽强的地主封建势力，是一个艰巨的任务。
    其次，领导干部应有重点的深入下去，仅仅以区村干部的一些统计材料为满足，这是麻痹自满的根源。冀县县区领导，开始认为四区地主已彻底消灭的认识，便是这样来的。因为下层干部容易在划分阶层上出偏差，及因见于一年来的伟大成就而忽视落后的地方。
    加速进行土地改革，争取春耕前彻底完成，但这并不是叫我们草率从事，急切求成；而是要我们克服自满，发挥艰苦深入细致的作风，务求封建彻底消灭，群众充分发动，以便在此基础之上，转向大生产。
