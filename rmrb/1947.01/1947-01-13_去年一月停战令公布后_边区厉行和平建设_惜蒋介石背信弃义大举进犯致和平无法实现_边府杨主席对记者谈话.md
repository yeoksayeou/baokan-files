　　After the Ceasefire Order Was Announced Last January
　　The Border Region Vigorously Implemented Peaceful Construction
　　Regrettably, Chiang Kai-shek Went Back on His Word and Launched a Large-Scale Invasion, Making Peace Impossible
　　Chairman Yang of the Border Government Talks to Reporters
　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Professor Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, recently pointed out to reporters: After the ceasefire order was announced last January, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region took many measures in terms of political power to achieve peace. However, Chiang Kai-shek went back on his word and launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas, destroying the ceasefire order, making peace impossible. Chairman Yang detailed these measures, stating: (1) In terms of transportation and commerce: After the publication of Peace Order No. 4 on February 2, the Border Region Government established three railway bureaus for the Shijiazhuang-Anyang section, the Dezhou-Shijiazhuang section, and the Tongpu Railway. In late February, a proclamation was issued to recover the rails. Our government spent money to purchase them and prohibited damage to the rails. The executive team saw these proclamations and considered them evidence of the execution of the order. The Daoqing, Jiaozuo, and Bo’ai sections were repaired, and the roadbed of the Pinghan Railway south and north of Handan began to be repaired. According to the decision of the Shijiazhuang team, the Kuomintang was to dismantle the碉堡, and the Communist side was to repair the Yuanshi to Gaoyi section of the Pinghan Railway, but the Kuomintang did not dismantle them. The Kuomintang representative of the executive team said that it was an order from his highest authority. Not only that, but the Kuomintang also dispatched armored trains from Shijiazhuang. The Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways tried to stop them, but to no avail. In terms of commerce: The Kuomintang prohibited commercial exchanges and detained merchants from the liberated areas in Shijiazhuang. The liberated areas faithfully implemented the free trade provisions of Peace Order No. 4. In Wenxi alone, 500,000 jin of wheat were sold to the Kuomintang army, but the Kuomintang has not yet paid. Yan Xishan has never sold anything to the liberated areas, but the liberated areas have transported a lot of things to Taiyuan, and no small amount of cotton has been sold to Tianjin and other places. From July to August, the Kuomintang implemented a strict blockade against the liberated areas, strictly prohibiting the export of medicinal materials, salt, and dyes. However, Handan still exported flour to the Kuomintang areas in September; coal from Jiaozuo and Liuhegou was also exported in large quantities to the Chiang-occupied areas of Anyang and Xinxiang. (2) Demobilization: In the first phase, from February to April, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region demobilized 75,000 soldiers. Three to four thousand soldiers from other areas passed through this region. The Border Government spent a huge sum on demobilization expenses. Returning refugees and demobilized students who passed through the liberated areas were taken care of. Two hundred students from Southwest Associated University, Chaoyang University, and Northwest Normal College passed through here to go to Beiping. (3) Preparations for the National Assembly: The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region formulated an election law in the council that began on March 26 and implemented universal suffrage according to the original plan. By April 25, all the delegates who should attend had been elected, and some had gathered in Handan. The above three points are just the most important ones. In addition, I don't know how many conferences were held to celebrate peace, and there were slogans everywhere welcoming peace. At this time, Chairman Yang said in a humorous tone that the development of the Chinese situation in the past year can also be seen from the changes in slogans: from "Celebrating Peace" to "Defending Peace" to "Armed Defense of the Border Region." The people also see more and more clearly the ugly and cunning true face of Chiang Kai-shek.

　　去年一月停战令公布后
    边区厉行和平建设
  　惜蒋介石背信弃义大举进犯致和平无法实现
    边府杨主席对记者谈话
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰教授，顷向记者指出：去年一月停战令公布后晋冀鲁豫边区在政权方面曾有很多措施，以实现和平，借国民党背信弃义大举进攻解放区，破坏了停战令，以致和平无法实现。杨主席详述这些措施称：（一）在交通和商业方面：二月二日和平第四号命令发表后，边区政府曾成立石安段、德石段以及同蒲路的三个铁路局。二月下旬即公布收回铁轨的布告，我政府出钱收买并禁止损害铁轨，执行小组看见了这些布告，认为是执行命令的证据，道清、焦作、博爱段已修复，并开始修平汉路邯郸南北的路基。按石家庄小组决定国民党拆除碉堡，共方修复平汉路元氏至高邑段，但国民党不拆，执行小组国方代表谓系奉其最高当局之命令。非但如此，国民党还从石家庄开铁甲车出来，铁道部交通处加以阻止也无结果。商业方面：国民党禁止通商往来，在石家庄扣留解放区商人。解放区却忠实的实行和字第四号命令中有自由贸易的规定，在闻喜一地就有五十万斤麦子卖给国民党军队，国民党迄未付款。阎锡山始终不卖东西给解放区，但解放区却运了很多东西至太原，卖给天津等地的棉花也不在少数。七八月间，国民党对解放区实行严厉封锁，药材盐染料的严禁输出，但邯郸在九月间还输出面粉给国民党区；焦作、六河沟的煤炭亦曾大量的输出蒋占区之安阳新乡一带。（二）复员方面：晋冀鲁豫边区复员的军队，第一期二月至四月有七万五千人，外区经过此区者有三四千人，边府为此支出之复员费为数甚巨。还乡难民及复员学生经过解放区的曾加以照顾，西南联大、朝阳大学、西北师范学院即有二百学生经过这里到北平去。（三）国大准备：晋冀鲁豫边区在三月二十六日开始的参议会中就拟定了选举法，按照原先的还实行普选。四月二十五日应出席的名额全部选出，一部分已集中到邯郸。以上三点仅举其荦荦大者，此外仅是庆祝和平的大会就不知开了多少，到处都是欢迎和平的标语。这时杨主席以幽默的口吻说，从标语的变迁上也可以看到一年来中国局势的发展：由“庆祝和平”到“保卫和平”到“武装保卫边区”，人民也一天比一天更明白的看清了蒋介石的丑恶狡猾的真面目。
