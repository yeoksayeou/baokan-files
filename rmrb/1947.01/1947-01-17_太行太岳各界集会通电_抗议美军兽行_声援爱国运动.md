　　Taihang and Taiyue Circles Hold Meetings and Send Telegrams
    Protest Against American Military Atrocities, Support Patriotic Movement
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi, 14th dispatch] Various circles of the Taihang Party, government, military, and academia, as well as mass organizations, commemorated the first anniversary of the armistice order and the Political Consultative Conference, and expressed support for the patriotic movement across the country against American military atrocities. Yesterday, a mass rally of more than 3,000 people was held in Zhangnan Town, Shexian County. General Zhao Huilou, Deputy Commander of the Taihang Military Region, Zhou Guangdan, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Region, Li Yiqing, Director of the Taihang Administrative Office, Mr. Li Jingtian, a member of the Border Region Council, and poet Gang Fu attended and were invited to speak. Leaflets such as "The Case of American Soldiers Raping Female Students in Beiping," "The Achievements of the Liberated Area's One-Year Self-Defense War," and "The Great Victory in Shandong and Hebei-Shandong-Henan in the New Year" were distributed throughout the town. The atrocities of the American military aroused anger in everyone, and shouts of "American soldiers get out" and "We fully support the students' patriotic movement" were heard from the crowd from time to time. Farmers said, "The American soldiers dare to do this because of Chiang Kai-shek, that son of a bitch." Schools in Shexian County and the Zhangnan Town Chamber of Commerce held costumed propaganda. In his speech, Director Li called on the entire region to provide greater support to the patriotic self-defense front, and to support the national patriotic movement with the victory of the liberated areas. The conference finally passed a telegram protesting the US-Chiang commercial treaty, anti-American military atrocities, and supporting the national student patriotic movement.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue, 14th dispatch] The Taiyue District Federation of Trade Unions, Peasants' Associations, and Youth Leagues, representing the seven million people of the entire district, in response to the patriotic students in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hong Kong protesting against American military atrocities, and expressing full support for this movement, issued a telegram, excerpts of which are as follows: The atrocities of the American military in China are a great shame to the Chinese nation and should not be simply regarded as individual cases. Only the Chiang Kai-shek government, which recognizes the enemy as its father and seeks glory by selling out the country, can defend American imperialism in this way. Your patriotic movement protesting American military atrocities and demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China is the concentrated expression of the will of the Chinese people. Your actions have received the support and endorsement of the broad masses of the people. Our Taiyue Liberated Area Federation of Trade Unions, Peasants' Associations, Youth Leagues, and Women's Federations, representing the seven million people of the entire district, vow to be your backing and are willing to work together to achieve China's independence, peace, and democracy, and to demand the withdrawal of American troops from China until the end.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue, further dispatch] "American troops get out of China immediately!" This is the angry cry of the seven middle schools in Taiyue, Jinan, Jinyu, Tiaodong, Yubei, and Yuenan secondary schools in Taiyue, including the Taiyue, Jinan, Jinyu, Tiaodong, Yubei, and Yuenan, protesting the American military's rape of female students in Beiping and responding to the demonstrations of students in Beijing, Tianjin, Kyoto, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. The students of the seven schools jointly issued a telegram, which stated in brief: "Chinese students, who have a glorious history of the 'May Fourth' Movement and the tradition of the 'December 9th' Movement, can never tolerate such atrocities by American imperialism. Students, unite and vow to fight for the withdrawal of American troops from China."
