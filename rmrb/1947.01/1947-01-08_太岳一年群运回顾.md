    A Review of the Mass Movement in the Taiyue Region Over the Past Year
    (I) Since the regional mass work conference put forward the policy of bold mobilization and the mass line of leading the masses to liberate themselves in November of the year before last, the mass movement for emancipation in our region has flourished around the end of that year.

    More than half of our region is newly liberated. Here, the masses hate traitors and local bullies the most, and they urgently demand to recover their blood debts from these people. At this time, the leadership resoundingly put forward the slogan of "pouring out grievances and seeking revenge." Thus, under the call of "avenge those who have grievances and seek revenge for those who have been wronged," the masses quickly mobilized, breaking the "change of heaven" thinking of some people. The movement was as fierce as a storm, quickly breaking through the base points, spreading from points to areas, from the interior to the periphery, and directly extending to stubbornly occupied towns and near transportation lines. For example, the anti-"sixty jin" movement in Yuanqu County, in the forty days around March, spread to 71 of the county's 77 villages. In the movement, the masses poured out the grievances and sufferings that had been accumulated in their hearts for a long time. Many big traitors and bullies who had been rampant for a while bowed their heads before the masses. The masses' level of awareness was raised, and land, houses, and other properties that had been occupied were recovered. According to the statistics of many counties, the fruits obtained by the masses from pouring out grievances and seeking revenge and from countering traitors and settling accounts accounted for about one-half of all fruits. This unprecedented movement of pouring out grievances and seeking revenge reached its climax in February, March, and April.

    At the same time, old liberated areas such as Qinyuan, Anze, Qinshui, Yangcheng, and Shimin also launched an unprecedented large-scale rent reduction movement. However, when this movement reached its first peak, many cadres were satisfied with this initial victory, and a "good enough" mentality became quite prevalent for a time, and the issue of rent and interest was underestimated. At this time, various counties successively convened meetings of cadres and activists, using real examples and the grievances of the masses to gradually break the underestimation of rent and interest and the "good enough" mentality. Various places successively broke the temporary state of silence in February, March, and April, and the movement was re-launched and deepened—successively turning to rent reduction, debt clearing, interest reduction, and rent refunds and interest refunds.

    Many areas have moved from pouring out grievances and seeking revenge to pouring out grievances and digging out the roots of poverty: "Whose land is it anyway?" "Who lives off whom?" "Who has a conscience?" "Who created the world?" ...such fundamental questions were raised, and heated debates and pouring out of grievances were launched in vast areas, with some people nearly dying several times from the intensity of their outpouring. As a result, the general masses rightfully took back from the feudal rulers the crystallization of their blood and sweat—land and houses. Ideas such as "conscience" and "fate" were gradually broken, and the broad masses truly recognized the truth that labor creates the world.

    With the deepening of the movement and the improvement of the masses' awareness, they further put forward new and reasonable demands—to realize "land to the tiller." For example, the masses in Tianshuiling asked, "Does not having land count as emancipation?" and the masses in the Fourth District of Gaoping asked to recover the "gold-scraping boards" (land), which are examples of this.

    Looking at the scope of the movement, it was also unprecedented. Before the wheat harvest, the movement had spread to 92 percent of the villages in the entire region (excluding border areas), with the blank areas in the old liberated areas accounting for less than 1 percent. The movement in many areas along the Tongpu Railway extended to areas three to five li away from the railway. As the masses in Xiangling said: "We have moved to places where guns and cannons cannot reach."

    As the movement deepened, the problems became more complicated, and the landlords sought opportunities to counterattack. Because a few areas had been too harsh in attacking rich peasants and had also dragged in some middle peasants, the landlords' scolding, the middle elements' doubts, and the dissatisfaction and complaints of some comrades within the Party all occurred. However, the leadership learned from historical lessons and was not blinded or moved by this individual phenomenon, but continued to implement the policy of bold mobilization. As a result, this vigorous movement that shook the foundation of feudalism for thousands of years continued until before the wheat harvest and reached a new climax.

    From the beginning of the year to the wheat harvest, this intense movement was unprecedented in the Taiyue Region, whether in terms of scale or intensity. However, the development of the movement was still uneven. The degree of depth of the movement varied from region to region. Some regions were better, some were worse, and some were even only "skin-deep," far from realizing "land to the tiller." According to the statistics of the "July Conference," by the time of the wheat harvest, only 12 percent of the region had realized "land to the tiller," and only 55 percent in the old liberated areas had achieved "land to the tiller."

    (II) After the wheat harvest, the war situation in our region began to become tense. At the same time, the production season arrived, and the peasants were busy with the wheat harvest. The leadership did not solve the problem of combining the masses with the war and production well enough, and the guiding ideology for mobilizing the masses in the border areas was not clear enough. These subjective and objective reasons combined to cause the large-scale movement of anti-traitor liquidation, rent reduction, and interest reduction in the entire region to generally come to a halt, and it was replaced by small-scale liquidation. From July to September, a regional mass work conference was held to summarize the achievements and experiences of the past six months, approve the reasonable demands of the masses, and resoundingly put forward the policy of bold mobilization and realization of "land to the tiller." However, due to the above reasons, this policy was not immediately transmitted to the counties along the Baijin Line to push the movement to a climax. In many areas, it was not officially transmitted to the villages until late autumn and early winter. During this period, the situation of the mass movement in the entire region can be roughly divided into the following three types: The first type was the four counties in the old liberated areas of Qinyuan, Anze, Jishi (now merged into Anze), and Shimin, which had already turned to production, and the land reform movement had generally stopped. The second type was the border areas along the Tongpu Railway, the areas bordering the enemy in northern Henan, and the entire Third Sub-district, which generally launched struggles against conscription, grain grabbing, slaughter, rape, and against counter-settlement. However, due to the frequent wars, the masses were busy participating in the war and other work, and the leadership's understanding of the relationship between the war and the mass movement was not clear enough. Insufficient attention was paid to land reform in the border areas, and there was a lack of planned organization and leadership, which led to the land reform movement in the border areas generally falling into a state of stagnation. However, there were also individual places where land reform was completed in the midst of artillery fire, with one hand holding a gun and the other settling accounts, such as the "Du Ba Lian" of Jiyuan, which was the most outstanding example of this. The third type was the Baijin Line and other relatively stable new areas. There were two different situations here: one was like the counties at the foot of the mountains in northern Henan, where the movement had not completely stopped, but it was mostly small-scale liquidation, rising and falling, and it was not able to form a upsurge; the other was like Qin County, Tunliu, Changzi and other counties, which seized the time to transmit the "July Conference's" policy of realizing "land to the tiller," and also seized the gaps in participating in the war. Qin County even combined the mass movement and production very well, so that the movement did not fall into stagnation, and even deepened the movement, pushing the movement to a new climax in late autumn and early winter.

    As mentioned above, from the wheat harvest to the end of autumn, the development of the mass movement in our region was extremely uneven. The degree of completion of land reform in most areas remained unchanged from the July Conference. After six months of struggle, large or small, in other counties, the percentage of villages that had completed or largely completed land reform accounted for the following approximate percentages of the total number of villages in the county: Qinyuan 95 percent, Tunliu 70 percent, Changzi 51 percent, Shimin 71 percent, Gaoping 66 percent, Jincheng 53 percent, and Yangcheng 86 percent.

    Since the beginning of winter, various places have successively convened cadre activist conferences, and some places have also convened turn-over hero conferences to transmit and discuss the policy of "land to the tiller," and gradually unified their understanding. Under this policy, all parts of the region have launched new movements. In areas where the large-scale movement has passed, a major turn-over inspection is underway to check feudalism and repair loopholes; in areas where land reform is not thorough, the masses are engaging in struggle with a new attitude, and the movement is rapidly and vigorously developing.

    From now until before spring plowing, about one hundred days will be the final and most critical stage of the mass movement in our region. Standing at such a historically significant time, looking back at our year of mass movement, we should be more vigilant and strive forward, accept the valuable experiences and lessons of the past year, to promote the further development of the movement, and strive to complete the historical task of land reform in the entire region before spring plowing. We should first accept the most valuable experience of the year, continue to implement the policy of bold mobilization, implement the mass line, firmly stand on the position of the masses, believe in the power, wisdom, and creation of the masses, boldly promote new creations of the masses, lead the masses to realize "land returning home" themselves, and liberate themselves. The way of struggle, the method of liquidation, and the method of distributing the fruits should all be passed through the local masses, and the leadership should not subjectively create them rigidly. We should also accept the lessons of the past, universally and deeply publicize and explain the policy of realizing "land to the tiller," and establish a clear and unified understanding of what "land to the tiller" is. Since the July Conference, due to the war and other various reasons, the policy of "land to the tiller" has not been quickly and formally transmitted, which has affected the progress of the movement. So now we should carry out extensive propaganda and mobilization so that everyone clearly recognizes that land reform is "land returning home," "land demobilization," and is a revolution against feudal forces. Only with such a clear understanding can we launch a movement of simultaneous liquidation and simultaneous turn-over like Jiyuan, and quickly and thoroughly realize land reform. We should also accept the lessons of the past six months, break the stagnant state of the land reform movement in the border areas, and launch the land reform movement in the border areas. Recognize that only by implementing land reform can we prevent the phenomenon of retreat in the border areas, defeat the attacks and rule of the stubborn puppets, and establish a democratic order, overcome or prevent the phenomenon of neglecting land reform in the border areas, and strive to fully realize land to the tiller throughout the region.

    太岳一年群运回顾
    （一）自前年十一月全区群众工作会议提出大胆放手的方针，与领导群众自己解放自己的群众路线之后，我区的群众翻身运动于年关前后蓬勃展开。
    我区有二分之一以上地区为新解放区，在这里，群众最痛恨的是汉奸恶霸，他们迫切的要求向这些人索回血债。这时领导上响亮的提出了诉苦复仇的口号。于是群众在有仇报仇有冤报冤的呼声下，迅速发动起来，打破了某些“变天”思想，运动的猛烈有如狂风骤雨，很快的突破基点，由点到面，由内地到边沿，直伸至顽占城镇及交通线附近。如垣曲的反“六十斤”运动，在三月前后的四十天内，普遍到全县七十七个村的七十一村。群众在运动中吐出长期积压在胸中的怨气与苦水，许多横行一时的大奸大霸在群众面前低头了，群众觉悟程度提高了，被霸占土地房产等收回了。据许多县的统计，群众从诉苦复仇、反奸清算中取得的果实，约占全部果实的二分之一左右。这个规模空前的诉苦复仇运动，先后于二、三、四月份走上高潮。
    与此同时，沁源、安泽、沁水、阳城、士敏等老解放区，也展开了规模深度都是空前的大查减运动。可是这个运动在达到第一个顶点的时候，许多干部为这初步的胜利而满足，一时相当普遍的产生了“差不多”的思想，轻视租息问题。这时各县先后召开了干部积极分子会议，用现实的事例，经群众诉苦逐渐打破了轻视租息与“差不多”的思想，各地先后于二、三、四月打破了暂时沉寂的状态，运动从新展开并深入一步——先后转入减租、清债、减息与退租、退息。
    许多地区由诉苦复仇进而至诉苦挖穷根：“土地究竟是谁的？”“谁靠谁活？”“谁有良心？”“世界是谁创造的？”……等根本问题被提出来了，广大地区展开了热烈的争辩与诉苦，有的诉得几次死去活来。因之一般群众都理直气壮的从封建统治者手里讨回了自己血汗的结晶——土地房产。“良心”“命运”等思想逐渐打破，广大群众真正认识到劳动创造世界的真理。
    随着运动的深入与群众觉悟的提高，他们又进一步提出了新的合理的要求——实现耕者有其田。如天水岭群众提出“没有土地算不算翻身？”高平四区群众提出要收回“刮金板子”（土地）便是例证。
    再从运动普遍的面来看也是空前的。至麦收前全区（边地除外）扩展至百分之九十二村庄，其中老区的空白区已不及百分之一，同浦沿线许多地区的运动，一直伸展到离铁路三五里的地区。正如襄陵群众所说：“枪炮打不到的地方，我们都运动到了。”
    运动深入一步，问题也就更复杂了，地主们寻隙反攻。由于少数地区打击富农过重，并捎带了一些中农，此时地主的叫骂，中间分子的疑虑，党内某些同志的不满与埋怨都发生了；但领导上接受了历史的教训，没有为这个别现象所蒙蔽与动心，而是继续贯彻大胆放手的方针。因之这个轰轰烈烈震撼几千年封建基石的运动，一直继续到麦收以前而达到一个新的高潮。
    从年初到麦收，这一段猛烈的运动。不论其规模或程度上，在太岳区说都是空前的；然而运动的发展仍是不平衡的，有些地区运动深入的程度深，有些地区较差，甚至有些地区只是“水过地皮湿”，离实现耕者有其田尚远。据“七月会议”的统计，至麦收时，全区只有百分之十二的地区实现了耕者有其田，在老区内也只有百分之五十五达到了“耕者有其田”。
    （二）麦收后，本区战争形势开始紧张，同时生产季节到来，农民们忙于麦收，而领导上又没很好解决群众与战争，生产结合问题，对边沿区发动群众指导思想上亦不够明确，这些主客观原因凑合起来，致使全区反奸清算、减租减息的大规模的运动浪潮一般停顿下来，而代之以小规模清算。七月至九月召开了全区群众工作会议，总结了半年的成绩与经验，批准了群众合理的要求，响亮的提出了大胆放手，实现耕者有其田的方针；但是由于上述原因，这个方针除白晋线数县即时传达下去使运动走向高潮外，不少地区直至秋末冬初才正式传达到村。这个时期，全区群运的情况大别分为下述三个类型：第一类是老区的沁源、安泽、冀氏（现已归并安泽）士敏四县，已转入生产，土地改革的运动一般停顿。第二类是边沿区的同蒲沿线、豫北接敌区及整个三分区，一般都展开了反抓丁、反抢粮、反屠杀、反奸淫的对敌斗争，与反倒算运动。但由于战争频繁，群众忙于参战等工作，及领导上对战争与群运的关系认识不够明确，对边沿区实行土地改革重视不够，缺乏有计划的组织领导，致使边沿区土地改革运动一般陷于停顿状态。但也有个别地方一手持枪一手清算，在炮火中完成了土地改革的，如济源的“杜八联”便是此中最出色的典型。第三类是白晋沿线及其他较安定的新区，这里又有两种不同的情势：一种如豫北山下几县，运动虽未完全停顿，但多系小的清算，此起彼伏，没能形成热潮；另一种如沁县、屯留、长子等县，他们抓紧时间传达了“七月会议”实现耕者有其田的方针，也抓住了参战的空隙，沁县更使群运、生产很好的结合起来，所以未使运动陷于停滞，而且更使运动深入一步，于秋末冬初将运动推向新的高潮。
    如上所说，自麦收后至秋末，我区群运的发展是极不整齐的，大部地区完成土地改革的程度，与七月会议时无人变动，其他各县经过半年或大或小的斗争，其已完成与大体完成土地改革的村庄，占全县村庄的百分比约略如下：沁源百分之九十五，屯留百分之七十，长子百分之五十一，士敏百分之七十一，高平百分之六十六，晋城百分之五十三，阳城百分之八十六。
    入冬以来，各地先后召开了干部积极分子大会，有的地方并召开了翻身英雄大会，传达与讨论了耕者有其田的方针，逐渐统一了认识。在这个方针下，全区各地均投入新的运动。在大运动已过的地区，正在进行翻身大检查，实行查封建补窟窿；在土地改革不彻底的地区，群众正以新的姿态投入斗争，运动正迅速猛烈开展中。
    从现在到春耕前，约一百天的时间，将是我区群运最后也是最紧要的阶段。处在这样一个有历史意义的时间，回顾一下我们一年的群众运动，更应惕励奋发，接受一年来宝贵的经验与教训，以推动运动进一步发展，争取春耕前完成全区土地改革的历史任务。我们首应接受一年最珍贵的经验，继续贯彻大胆放手的方针，贯彻走群众路线，坚决站在群众的立场上，相信群众的力量、智慧和创造，大胆发扬群众新的创造，领导群众起来自己实现“土地回家”，自己解放自己，无论斗争方式、清算方法、分配果实的办法，都应通过当地群众、领导不可主观生制硬造。我们还应接受过去的经验教训，普遍深入的宣传解释实现耕者有其田的政策，对什么是耕者有其田，树立明确统一的认识。七月会议以来，由于战争及其他各种原因，使耕者有其田的方针未能很快的正式传达下去，影响了运动的进展，那么现在便应进行广泛的宣传动员，使大家都明确认识土地改革便是“土地回家”，“土地复员”，是向封建势力的一个革命。只有在这样明确的认识下，才能像济源那样如火如荼的展开一齐清算，一齐翻身的运动，才能迅速彻底的实现土地改革。我们更应接受半年的教训，打破边沿区土地改革运动的停滞状态，展开边沿区的土地改革运动。认清只有实行了土地改革，才能防止边沿区的退缩现象，打垮顽伪的进攻与统治，而建立民主的秩序，克服或防止忽视边沿区土地改革的现象，争取全区范围内全部实现耕者有其田。
