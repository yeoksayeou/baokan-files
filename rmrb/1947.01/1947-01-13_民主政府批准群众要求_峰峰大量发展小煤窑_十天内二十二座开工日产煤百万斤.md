　　Democratic Government Approves Masses' Request
    Fengfeng Massively Develops Small Coal Mines
  　Twenty-Two Opened in Ten Days, Daily Output of One Million Jin of Coal
    [Our newspaper from Cixian] Small coal mines in Fengfeng are developing massively. Within ten days, twenty-two small kilns have begun producing coal. In response to the masses' requests, the democratic government has specially authorized the opening of small coal mines, with a management committee organized by the government, shareholders, and the trade union to be specifically responsible for mining, transportation, and sales. Money and people can invest in shares; those who do not wish to be shareholders can also work in the kiln and earn wages. This method began on December 20th of last year, and by the 31st, within ten days, twenty-two small kilns had begun producing coal. The average daily output is one million jin of coal, which can be sold for 7 million yuan. Generally, workers can earn 600-700 yuan per day, and skilled workers can earn 1,200 yuan. Seeing the large profits, the masses are clamoring to pool shares and start mining. Street Two Village (in the mining area) already has three kilns producing coal, with a daily income of 1,159,200 yuan. After deducting all expenses, the net profit is 579,600 yuan. If this is divided equally among the entire village population, each person (including children) can receive 356 yuan per day; family members of soldiers receive double dividends. It is estimated that within the first ten days of January, the daily output of coal can reach 1.5 million jin.

　　民主政府批准群众要求
    峰峰大量发展小煤窑
  　十天内二十二座开工日产煤百万斤
    【本报磁县讯】峰峰小煤窑正大量发展。十天内即有二十二个小窑出炭。民主政府应群众要求，特许开辟小煤窑，由政府、股东、工会三方面组织管理委员会，专司采掘、运销等事。钱、人均可入股；不愿当股东而进窑做工赚工资亦行。此办法从去年十二月二十号开始，到三十一号为止，旬日内即有二十二个小窑出炭。平均每日出炭一百万斤，可售洋七百万元。一般工人每天可分六、七百元，技术工人可得一千二百元。群众看见利大，纷纷要求集股开采。街二庄（在矿区）村已有三个窑出炭，每日能收入一百一十五万九千二百元，除去一切费用，可得纯利五十七万九千六百元。如以全村人口平均，每日每人（小孩也算）可分三百五十六元；军属加倍分红。估计在一月前十天内，即可日产煤炭一百五十万斤。
