　　Small and Medium Landlords of Yuncheng
    Leaving the Chiang Army and Returning Home
  　Enjoying a Happy Life Again, with Property Rights and Human Rights Fully Guaranteed
    [Reported by our press corps on the 12th] Small and medium landlords of Yuncheng, who had fled the liberated areas after listening to rumors spread by Chiang's secret agents, have recently returned to their hometowns one after another, living happy lives with property rights and human rights protected by the government and the law. Jin Ningtai, a landlord from Wangying in the Fifth District, whose family consists of four people, had previously fled to Luoyang, bought a cotton gin and a bow, and earned a meager living ginning cotton for others, barely enough to eat half-full each day. This time, when he came to the liberated area with the Chiang army and learned that his family still had fifty mu of land after the land reform movement, enough to eat and use, he immediately summoned his brothers and father to come home. Zhang Wenfan, a landlord from Zhang Village in the Seventh District, also fled after the enemy surrendered and joined the "Returning Home Corps" organized by Chiang Kai-shek. This time, he returned with the invading army and actively caused disturbances. He was captured by our guerrillas, and after being informed of his family's recent situation, he was overcome with remorse and immediately withdrew from the reactionary organization, reuniting happily with his family. Liang Zan, a landlord from Liang Village, fled during the struggle. This time, after returning home and seeing the actual situation, he said, "I used to believe the rumors about how terrible the struggle was. This time, when I came back, I saw that my family had enough to eat and wear, and their life was very good. I am determined not to leave again." These small and medium landlords, having seen that the land reform movement was not the terrible thing Chiang's propaganda made it out to be, many landlords returned to the liberated areas after the Chiang army was driven away. In Ma Village alone, there are several families, including Ma Jiuquan and Ma Dingshi.

　　郓城中小逃亡地主
    相率脱离蒋军返里
  　重度幸福生活财权人权均获保障
    【本报记者团十二日电】听信蒋特谣言而逃亡解放区外之郓城中小地主，近纷纷返回家乡，过着幸福生活，地权、财权、人权均得政府法律保护。五区王营地主金宁泰一家四口，前曾逃至洛阳，购置弹花洋弓一架，为人弹花，整日劳动，仅足半饱。此次随蒋军来到解放区，知道他家在土地改革运动后尚有五十亩地，够吃够用，他马上就把弟兄爷儿都约回家来了。七区张庄地主张文范，亦在敌人投降后逃亡，参加蒋介石组织的“还乡团”。此次随进犯军回来，积极出扰，被我游击队员俘掳，告以其家庭近况后，不胜懊悔，当即脱离反动组织，与家人欢聚。梁庄地主梁赞之，在斗争中逃跑，这次回家，看到实际状况后说：“我以前听信谣言，说斗争如何如何，这回回来一看，原来我家有吃有穿，生活过得很好，我下决心不走了。”这些中小地主们，见到土地改革运动，并不是蒋家谣言说的那一套可怕事情，故在蒋军被赶走后，有不少地主返回解放区。马庄一村即有马九泉及马丁石等数家。
