Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th (Delayed Dispatch): The civil unrest in Xikang is spreading like wildfire. According to a report in the Chongqing Business Daily on the 23rd of last month, while the civil unrest forces led by Chen Jingwu in the Tianquan and Rongjing areas were launching large-scale attacks on several county towns, nearly 100,000 Yi people in the Liangshan area of eastern Kang province were also forced to stage an armed uprising to resist the Chiang army's "suppression." Since Chiang Kai-shek's forces entered Xichang and other places, the Yi people in this area have been "encircled and suppressed" three times. However, because the Yi soldiers are brave and good at fighting, and can use guerrilla tactics, and the terrain is extremely dangerous, the Chiang army's repeated "suppressions" have resulted in heavy losses. On the 4th of last month, He Guoguang, the garrison commander of Xichang, launched another large-scale offensive, dispatching the 292nd Regiment and 407th Regiment of the "Jingbian Department," as well as a large number of Yi soldiers under their control, along with other field troops, and using two aircraft in coordination, to launch a multi-pronged attack on Xuange Bulu, Wulidian, Qiaoliangzi and other places. However, from December 12th, when fierce fighting broke out in various places, until the 19th, the Chiang army had "not made significant progress." According to a reporter from the Business Daily, the Yi people have adopted a "scorched earth resistance" policy, burning down all villages when abandoning a place. The Chiang army has no food or lodging wherever it goes; moreover, there are no roads in the high mountains, and supplies are difficult, and the further they go, the more dangerous the situation becomes.

    西康东部大凉山地区
    又有十万夷人起义
    【新华社延安十八日电】（迟到）西康民变势若燎原。据上月二十三日渝商务日报消息，在天全、荣经一带之民变武装陈经武部大举进攻若干县城之际，康省东部大凉山地区夷族近十万人又被迫武装起义，反抗蒋军之“进剿”。该地区夷族自蒋介石势力进入西昌等地后，前后已被“围剿”三次。但因夷兵英勇善战，且能运用游击战术，地形又极险阻，故蒋军屡次“进剿”均损兵折将而还。上月四日，西昌警备司令贺国光又发动大举进攻，派遣“靖边部”之二九二团、四○七团及其所羁勒之大队夷兵，与其他野战部队，并以飞机两架配合，向宣格补鲁、五里店、桥梁子等地分进合击。但自十二月十二日各地展开激战以迄十九日，各路蒋军“尚无显著之进展”。据商务日报记者称：夷民采取“焦土抗战”政策，凡放弃一地，即将村庄全部焚毁。蒋军所到无可食宿；且高山无路，补给困难，愈深入愈陷险境。
