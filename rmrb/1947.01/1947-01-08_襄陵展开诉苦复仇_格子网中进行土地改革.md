    [This news is] transmitted from Taiyue on the 5th of this month: Xiangling County, situated in the grid-like areas behind Chiang's army lines, began a new grievance-airing and revenge movement at the end of the year. Armed forces captured members of the puppet village compilation, and grievance-airing and revenge rallies of thousands of people were held next to Chiang's army strongholds. On the 18th, a rally of 5,000 people was held in Nanliang Village, publicly trying the puppet village compilation village special commissioner Gao Guangxiang and more than 20 others. At the meeting, the masses shouted: "Revenge grievances! Redress wrongs!" This action educated landlords who had fled from other counties to seek refuge with the enemy, such as the Fushan landlord Ma Mingkui and others, who, seeing the power of the masses, dared not engage in further activities. Note: Since Chiang's army occupied Xiangling, there have been numerous kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies, with more than ten ways of collecting grain alone, such as grain purchased on credit, military purchased grain, etc. When demanding grain, money, and manpower, they also used armed forces, engaging in burning, killing, and looting without restraint. Therefore, in addition to organizing armed forces to capture Chiang's puppet personnel, the local masses launched a grievance-airing, revenge, and land reform movement.

    襄陵展开诉苦复仇
    格子网中进行土地改革
    【本报太岳五日电】处于蒋军后方格子网中的襄陵县，于年底开始了新的诉苦复仇运动，武装捕捉伪编村人员，在蒋军据点旁召开数千人的诉苦复仇大会。十八日南梁村召开五千人的大会，公审伪编村村特派员高光祥等二十余人，会上群众高喊：“有仇报仇！有冤伸冤！”这种行动，教育了外县逃来投奔敌人的地主，如浮山地主马鸣魁等，看到群众的力量，不敢再活动。按：襄陵自蒋军侵占以来，苛捐杂税名目繁多，仅征粮方法即有十余种之多，如赊购粮、军购粮等。要粮要款要丁时，又配合武装，烧杀抢掠无所不为。因此当地群众除组织武装捕捉蒋伪人员外，并展开诉苦复仇土地改革运动。
