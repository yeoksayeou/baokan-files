Commenting on Marshall's Statement on Leaving China
    Comrade Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Yan'an Commemoration Meeting on January 10th

    A year ago today was the day the National Ceasefire Agreement was signed and the Political Consultative Conference opened. In this entire year, the changes in the situation and the development of people's awareness have been rapid. A year ago today, people across the country were celebrating peace and a ceasefire, but before long, the whole country was plunged into the abyss of civil war. Everyone has realized that without abolishing warlordism, China will never achieve peace. Last January and February, people across the country were celebrating the success of the Political Consultative Conference, but before long, all the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference were overturned by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Everyone has realized that without abolishing the system of personal dictatorship, the democratic line of the Political Consultative Conference will never be realized. A year ago, the entire Chinese people welcomed President Truman's statement on China and General Marshall's mediation in China, but before long, the US imperialist policy towards China was fully exposed, and the Chiang Kai-shek government's traitorous diplomacy was also completely exposed. As a result, in major cities across China, from hundreds of thousands of students to the vast countryside, people shouted slogans such as "US troops get out of China," "Oppose US interference in China's internal affairs," "Oppose slavish diplomacy," and "Oppose the Sino-US Commercial Treaty."

    In the past year, not only has the Kuomintang reactionary faction re-ignited the civil war and destroyed the Political Consultative Conference, but even the American mediator who co-signed the ceasefire agreement no longer mentions the ceasefire order of last January. The Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and most of the so-called "social elites" who participated in the Political Consultative Conference have also joined the illegal "National Assembly" organized by one party, which completely undermined the Political Consultative Conference's line, and formulated a dictatorial "constitution" that completely violated the principles of the Political Consultative Conference, in order to deepen the national division. Therefore, now only the Chinese Communist Party, the truly democratic parties, the truly social elites, and the broadest masses of the people have been fighting to uphold the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference line of last January, and to demand that US troops withdraw from China and oppose US interference in China's internal affairs. Looking back on the struggles of this year, one cannot help but think of the martyrs who died for the ceasefire and the Political Consultative Conference and Mr. Wen, Li, and Tao. Their fighting spirit against the reactionary groups that undermined the ceasefire and the Political Consultative Conference has been inspiring us.

    In this year, just as General Marshall, on the eve of his departure from China, issued a concluding statement on a year of mediation, I will now discuss some of the main issues in the negotiations over the past year, based on his statement:

    General Marshall admitted that there is a reactionary group within the Kuomintang that dominates the Kuomintang government, including military and political leaders, who oppose the coalition government, do not believe in domestic cooperation, only believe that force can solve problems, and show no sincerity in implementing the Political Consultative Conference resolutions. All of this is true, but regrettably, he did not point out that Chiang Kai-shek is the supreme leader of this reactionary group. Chiang Kai-shek said that the coalition government meant overthrowing the government, and that party meetings were dividing up the spoils. After the establishment of the Beiping Executive Headquarters last year, Chiang Kai-shek opposed sending an executive group to the Northeast to mediate. On March 27, after the Northeast Ceasefire Agreement was signed, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Du Yuming to launch a major offensive in the Northeast. The June ceasefire negotiations failed because Chiang Kai-shek stubbornly violated the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and demanded that the CCP withdraw from the four liberated areas of northern Jiangsu and Rehe. Then he launched a major offensive in the interior. Until now, for a year, a total of 218 brigades (or divisions), accounting for 90% of its total force, have been mobilized in violation of the ceasefire agreement to attack the liberated areas led by the CCP. By the end of last year, they had invaded more than 174,000 square kilometers of the liberated areas and occupied 165 cities in the liberated areas. What is this if not a military offensive? The one-party "National Assembly" held last year completely undermined the Political Consultative Conference line and was decided by Chiang Kai-shek alone from beginning to end. Therefore, the main culprit for undermining the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions is none other than Chiang Kai-shek himself.

    The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group used force to "maintain its own feudal control," but as a result, even General Marshall had to admit that "it has increasingly weakened the strength of his government." "Economic destruction" and "transportation destruction" are all the results of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. The Chiang Kai-shek government spends 80% of its budget on military expenditures, coupled with the exploitation and control of bureaucratic capital and the corruption and incompetence of the dictatorial government. How can finance not be chaotic? How can the economy not collapse?

    Such a bad government, under the same leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, can be transformed into a good government simply by replacing a few so-called free elements within the Kuomintang and a small number of parties, such as the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, who once participated in the Political Consultative Conference last January, then betrayed the Political Consultative Conference, and actively participated in Chiang's National Assembly. General Marshall's idea is too cheap. Without the participation of the CCP in the so-called coalition government, Chiang Kai-shek's personal dictatorship system cannot be abolished, and it will never become a liberal government. General Marshall clearly knows that the Chiang's National Assembly held last year violated the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and its procedures, but he deliberately said that the dictatorial constitution it passed was a "democratic constitution," "the main parts of which are in line with the principles of the Political Consultative Conference" and "seem to include the CCP's demands." This is a deceptive statement. The main parts of the dictatorial constitution passed by Chiang's National Assembly last year are contrary to the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. The Political Consultative Conference advocated guaranteeing people's freedom, while Chiang's constitution restricts people's freedom; the Political Consultative Conference advocated guaranteeing the autonomy of ethnic minorities, while Chiang's constitution cancels the autonomy of ethnic minorities; the Political Consultative Conference advocated that the province be the highest unit of local autonomy, formulating provincial constitutions and implementing local egalitarianism, while Chiang's constitution cancels provincial constitutions and implements centralism; the Political Consultative Conference advocated that the central government implement a responsible cabinet system of the coalition government, while Chiang's constitution restores the presidential dictatorship system of the May 5th Draft Constitution. General Marshall's attempt to use the method of reorganizing the government by implementing Chiang's constitution as an end to one-party tutelage and to decorate Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government will only make it more discredited and more isolated, and will never gain the support of the people.

    Then, is the CCP's opposition to Chiang's constitution and its refusal to participate in the government under the current circumstances, its demand to restore the military positions of both sides on January 13 last year, and its demand to abolish Chiang's constitution and reopen party meetings, as General Marshall said, unable to promote a fair compromise? On the contrary, these demands are the fairest compromise and the minimum peaceful and democratic demands. Even General Marshall admitted that the CCP was willing to compromise in January and February last year. And since February and March, all actions that undermined the Political Consultative Conference and the ceasefire were clearly due to the Kuomintang reactionary group. The CCP still insists on compromising on the basis of the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference line of last January, which is based on what Marshall praised as the "free and far-reaching charter." By comparison, Chiang Kai-shek is undermining the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference line, while the CCP is maintaining the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference line. Is it not very clear whether Chiang Kai-shek is trying to eliminate the liberated areas or whether the CCP is pursuing the overthrow of the government? If it is said that Chiang Kai-shek cannot accept the fairest compromise of abolishing Chiang's constitution and restoring the military positions of January 13, then should the CCP recognize Chiang's National Assembly, constitution, and the military positions that undermined the ceasefire agreement as a fair compromise? Saying that the CCP has radical elements within the party who disregard national interests and the suffering of the people because the CCP does not recognize these unreasonable demands is the most untrue and attempt to insult the CCP. The Chinese people will never believe it, because the CCP has been serving the people for 26 years as one day, and only relies on the people to have today's prestige. If the CCP agreed to Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of these places in the liberated areas, allowing him to freely oppress the people, and recognized Chiang's National Assembly constitution, allowing him to continue his dictatorship, that would truly disregard the suffering of the people and national interests, and would certainly not achieve true peace.

    Many naive friends who yearn for peace do not study the reliable basis and minimum guarantees for a ceasefire, and are unwilling to fight for the principles they uphold, but only wait for the gift of peace. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek sees through this point, and when his offensive is favorable, he will never cease fire. When his offensive fails and he needs to gain time to reorganize his army in order to launch a new offensive, as was the case in January and February last year, he will agree to a ceasefire and hold so-called "peace talks." May I ask, how can a fair compromise be reached in this way? It can never be a fair compromise. It must be established on a reliable basis that is beneficial to the people. This basis is the ceasefire agreement signed by Marshall and Chiang Kai-shek's representative Zhang Qun last January and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions passed by Chiang Kai-shek. General Marshall's statement only mentions the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and does not mention the ceasefire agreement. This is not an accidental omission, but an intentional avoidance of his responsibility for signing it, and a way to find a way out for the US representatives of the Three-Man Committee and the Beiping Executive Headquarters; but it further proves that the US government is intentionally helping Chiang Kai-shek to launch a major civil war.

    Therefore, General Marshall's extreme resentment of the CCP's propaganda work can also be proven. Indeed, in the past year, the CCP has continuously exposed the errors of the US government's policy towards China since March last year, especially the US military's stationing in China to interfere in China's internal affairs, invading the liberated areas (the Anping incident mentioned by Marshall is only one of more than 30 such incidents), transporting Chiang's army, and the US government's assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's government's army with lend-lease materials, surplus materials, economic loans, warships, aircraft, military advisors, technical training, etc., has been continuously exposed and protested; and the essence of US imperialist colonialization of China and the facts of the Kuomintang government's traitorous diplomacy (such as the conclusion of aviation agreements, etc.) have often been thoroughly exposed by us. After July, even under Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale offensive, the CCP still continuously sought ways to compromise with the American mediator. Chiang Kai-shek, however, gained an inch and wanted a mile, and his unreasonable demands emerged one after another, but the American mediator never blamed him, but twice declared that the CCP had failed to accept his mediation, which could not but arouse our rebuttal. General Marshall believes that these propaganda are sufficient to arouse the government's hatred and are therefore of a "criminal nature." In fact, what motivates people is not abstract propaganda, but living facts; if the above-mentioned facts are not changed, they are all crimes in the eyes of nations that love independence and freedom!

    Now, General Marshall has returned to the United States to serve as the Secretary of State. I sincerely hope that he can stand on the position of the late President Roosevelt's policy towards China, and for the sake of the traditional friendship and interests of the two great nations of China and the United States, re-examine the US government's policy towards China in the past year, no longer continue the past mistakes, stop assisting the Chiang Kai-shek government in carrying out the civil war, withdraw US troops stationed in China, no longer interfere in China's internal affairs, and readjust Sino-US relations, which will definitely greatly help the Chinese people's efforts for peace, democracy, and independence, and also help peace and international cooperation in the Far East.

    On the first anniversary of the ceasefire and the Political Consultative Conference, we cannot forget this great anniversary and must continue to fight for it. We believe that all democratic people and compatriots across the country are willing to fight for it together in order to fully and thoroughly realize the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference line, and will not stop until the goal is achieved.

　　评马歇尔离华声明
    周恩来同志一月十日在延安纪念会上的讲演
    去年今日，正是全国停战协定签字与政治协商会议开幕的日子。在整整一年中，情形的变化与人民的觉悟发展得真快，一年前的今天，全国人民都在欢呼和平停战；但是为时不久，全国又陷入内战的深渊。大家已明白，不取消军阀主义的统治，中国永远得不到和平。去年一二月间，全国人民都在庆祝政协成功，但是为时不久，政协全部协议都被国民党反动派推翻了。大家已明白，不取消个人独裁的制度，民主的政协路线是永不会实现的。一年前，全中国人民都在欢迎杜鲁门总统的对华声明与马歇尔将军的来华调解，但是为时不久，美帝国主义对华政策已原形毕露，蒋介石政府的卖国外交亦暴露无遗。于是全中国各大城市从几十万学生直到广大的乡村，高呼“美军退出中国”，“反对美国干涉中国内政”，“反对奴才外交”，“反对中美商约”等口号。
    去年一年的变化，不仅国民党反动派重新挑起了内战，破坏了政协，便连一同签字于停战协定上的美国调人，也不再提起去年一月的停战令了。一同参加政协的青年党、民社党及大部分所谓“社会贤达”，也竟参加了彻底破坏政协路线的一党包办的非法“国大”，制定完全违背政协原则的独裁“宪法”，以加深全国的分裂局面。所以，现在只有中国共产党与真正民主党派、真正社会贤达及最广大的人民群众，才一直为坚持去年一月停战协定与政协路线而奋斗，为要求美军退出中国与反对美国干涉中国内政而奋斗。回顾这一年的奋斗，不由得不想起去年为停战政协奔走的“四八”遇难烈士及闻、李、陶诸先生，他们与破坏停战、破坏政协的反动集团的搏斗精神，一直在激励着我们。
    就在这一年，正当马歇尔将军于他离华前夜，发表了关于一年调解之总结性的声明，我现在按着他这个声明，略论上一年谈判中的几个主要问题：
    马歇尔将军承认国民党内有反动集团在国民党政府中占优势，而且包括军事与政治领袖，他们反对联合政府，不相信国内合作，只信武力可以解决问题，对实施政协决议显无诚意。这都是说得对的，但遗憾的是，他并未指出蒋介石就是这个反动集团的最高领袖。蒋介石说联合政府就是推翻政府，党派会议就是分赃会议。去年北平执行部成立后，蒋介石反对派执行小组到东北调处，三月二十七日，东北停战协议方签字后，蒋介石便命令杜聿明在东北大打。六月休战谈判未成，是蒋介石硬违背政协决议，要求中共退出苏北、热河等四个解放区破坏了的。接着他便在关内大打。直到现在，一年来，计违背停战协定调动了二百十八个旅（或师），占其全兵力百分之九十来进攻中共领导的解放区。至去年年底止，还侵入解放区十七万四千多平方公里的土地，侵占解放区一百六十五个城市，这不是武力进攻是什么？去年召开的一党“国大”，彻底破坏了政协路线，自始至终都是蒋介石一人决定的。所以，破坏停战协定、破坏政协决议的罪魁祸首不是别人，正是蒋介石自己。
    蒋介石反动集团用武力“维持其自己的封建控制”，但结果连马歇尔将军也不得不承认，“已使其政府的力量愈益薄弱”。“经济破坏”与“交通破坏”，都是蒋介石进行内战所造成的结果。蒋介石政府以其预算的百分之八十用在军费上，加以官僚资本的盘剥统制，独裁政府的腐败无能，金融如何不乱？经济如何不溃？
    这样的坏政府，在同一个蒋介石领导之下，换上几个去年一月曾经参加政协，后来又背叛政协，并积极参加蒋记国大的某些所谓国民党内自由分子与少数党派，如青年党、民社党之流的人，便可以一变而为好政府，马歇尔将军的想法未免太廉价了。没有中共参加的所谓联合政府，蒋介石的个人独裁制度是无法取消的，也绝不会成为自由主义政府。马歇尔将军明知去年召开的蒋记国大是破坏了政协决议及其程序的，但他却故意说它通过的独裁宪法是“民主宪法”，“其中主要部分均与政协原则相符合”，“且似已包括中共要求在内”，这真是欺人之谈。去年蒋记国大通过的独裁宪法，其主要部分均与政协原则相反。政协主张保障人民自由，蒋宪则限制人民自由；政协主张保障少数民族自治权，蒋宪则取消少数民族自治权；政协主张省为地方自治最高单位，自订省宪，实行地方均权主义，蒋宪则取消省宪，实行中央集权主义；政协主张中央政权实行联合政府的责任内阁制，蒋宪则恢复五五宪草的总统独裁制。马歇尔将军想以实行蒋宪改组政府的办法，算作结束一党训政，为蒋介石独裁政府装饰，结果只会使它更加失信，更加孤立，绝对得不到人民拥护。
    那么，中共这样反对蒋宪反对在现在情况下参加政府，要求恢复去年一月十三日的双方军事位置，要求取消蒋宪与重开党派会议，是否如马歇尔将军所说不能促成公允的妥协呢？恰恰相反，这些要求正是最公允的妥协，也是最低限度的和平民主要求，连马歇尔将军也承认中共在去年一、二月乃是愿意妥协的。而二、三月起，破坏政协、破坏停战的一切行动，显然是由于国民党反动集团。中共直到现在还是坚持在去年一月的停战协定与政协路线的基础，要求妥协，其根据正是马歇尔所称赞的“自由而且远大的宪章”。两相比较，蒋介石是在破坏停战协定、破坏政协路线，中共是在维持停战协定、维持政协路线。究竟是蒋介石在企图消灭解放区，还是中共在追求推翻政府，岂不十分明显了吗？若说蒋介石可以不接受取消蒋宪与恢复一月十三日军事位置之最公允的妥协，难道中共就应承认破坏政协的蒋记国大、宪法与破坏停战协定的军事位置才算公允的妥协么？中共不承认这些无理要求，就说中共党内有激烈分子，不顾国家利益与人民痛苦，这是最不合事实，而且企图污辱中共的说法，中国人民决不会相信，因为中共为人民服务二十六年来如一日，一切依靠人民才有今天的威信。如果中共同意蒋介石进占解放区这些地方，让他自由压迫人民，承认蒋记国大宪法，让他继续独裁，那才真是不顾人民痛苦与国家利益，而且也必然得不到真正和平。
    有许多渴望和平的天真朋友，不去研究停战的可靠根据和最低保障，不愿为坚持的原则奋斗，而只痴等和平之赐予。于是蒋介石看透了这点，在他进攻有利的时候，便决不停战，在他进攻失败需要取得时间整顿军队以便重新进攻，如像去年一、二月间那样，他便赞成停战，举行所谓“和谈”，请问这样怎能得到公允妥协呢？永远不能公允妥协。必须建立在一个对人民有利而可靠的基础上，这个基础就是去年一月为马歇尔及蒋介石代表张群所签字的停战协定与蒋介石所主持通过的政协决议。马歇尔将军的声明只提政协决议，不提停战协定，这不是偶然忘记，而是有意规避他签字在上边的责任，并为三人会议及北平执行部的美方代表寻求解脱；但反而愈加证明美国政府是在有意助长蒋介石大打内战了。
    因此马歇尔将军对中共宣传工作最为怀恨，也可得到证明。的确，在过去一年中，中共对去年三月以来美国政府对华政策的改变曾不断揭发其错误，尤其对美军驻华干涉中国内政、侵略解放区（马歇尔所提之安平事件，不过此中三十余件之一件而已）、运送蒋军，及美政府以租借物资、剩余物资、经济借款、军舰、飞机、军事顾问、技术训练等等援助蒋介石政府军队，更不断予以暴露和抗议；而美帝国主义殖民地化中国政策的本质及国民党政府卖国外交的事实（如缔结航空协定等）又常为我们揭露无遗。七月以后，中共在蒋介石大举进攻之下，犹与美国调人不断寻求妥协之道。乃蒋介石得寸进尺，贪得无厌，无理要求层出不穷，而美国调人始终无片言相责，反两次声明深怪中共未能接受其调解，这自不能不引起我方的驳斥。马歇尔将军认为上述这些宣传，足以激起政府的痛恨心理，故有“罪恶性质”。其实能激发人的并不是抽象的宣传，而是活生生的事实；如果上述的事实不改，在爱好独立自由的民族看来都是罪恶！
    现在，马歇尔将军回去任美国国务卿了，我很希望他能站在故罗斯福总统对华政策的立场上，为着中美两大民族的传统友谊和利益，重新检讨美国政府近一年来的对华政策，不再继续过去的错误，停止援助蒋介石政府进行内战，撤退驻华美军，不再干涉中国内政，重新调整中美关系，那一定会有大助于中国人民对于和平民主与独立的努力，也更有助于远东和平与国际合作。
    停战政协一周年，我们不能忘怀于这一伟大的纪念日，并且要为它继续奋斗。我们相信一切民主人士全国同胞都愿为它一道奋斗，以求停战协定与政协路线完全彻底实现，不达目的不止。
