    Accelerate the Completion of Land Reform
    Wenshang Trains Activists
    [Our newspaper, Jilu Yu, 24th dispatch] In order to carry out the land-to-the-tiller movement, Wenshang specially convened an activist training class. When Wenshang District 3 mobilized activists, the cadres were enthusiastic and worked actively, eliminating thoughts of "the world changing," and publicized land reform decrees, making everyone aware that land to the tiller was reasonable and legal, and that attending training was appropriate. Therefore, nearly seven hundred people were mobilized, and each work group exceeded its assigned task. The changes in the trainees' thinking during the training period were as follows: When the trainees arrived, they were afraid of the threats from special agents and did not dare to act. At that time, the leadership immediately proposed that each trainee should recognize the situation and eliminate concerns about special agents. Due to the explanation of the situation and the provision of support, everyone felt at ease. The next day, they turned to speaking out about their grievances. When speaking out, they recalled the scenes of being hungry and begging for food, and they began to weep. Ji De mentioned the past of not eating for a day or two and being scolded when asking the landlord to borrow a sheng of grain, and he was so angry and upset that he could not continue speaking. When Old Lady Zhao mentioned her suffering as a widow, her voice became trembling, and tears fell from her eyes. The leadership proposed that we could not just cry, so they began to guide the speaking out to dig up the roots of poverty. After discussion and deliberation, everyone understood the principle that land should be returned to the tiller, and explained to the trainees that land reform was reasonable and legal, demonstrating the attitude of the democratic government in acting as masters for everyone. Therefore, everyone happily said: "Chairman Mao is really our benefactor." So, at the graduation ceremony, all the trainees naturally and sincerely knelt down and kowtowed to Chairman Mao. Regarding how to work after returning, each team and group discussed and studied the situation in their respective villages. After the trainees returned to their villages, within five or six days, all six groups in the district began to take action.

    加速完成土地改革
    汶上训练积极分子
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】汶上为了开展土地还家运动，特召开积极分子训练班。汶上三区动员积极分子时，由于干部热情高，工作积极，去掉了变天思想，并宣传土地改革法令，使大家知道土地还家合理合法，受训去是应该的，因此动员的人将近七百，各工作组都超过了任务。学员在训练期间的思想变化是：学员到的时候，因怕特务的威胁，大家不敢动；当时领导上即根据这种情况，提出要使得每个学员认识形势，消除对特务的顾虑；由于讲解形势与撑腰，大家安了心。第二天即转到诉苦，在诉苦的时候，都互相回忆自己挨饿讨饭的情景，即呜呜的哭起来，姬的举说到一两天不吃饭，去问地主借升粮食挨骂的往事，他又气又脑的说不下话去。赵老太太提起自己守寡受气，声音变成颤抖，眼里掉下泪来时，领导上提出我们光哭不行，于是开始引导诉苦挖穷根，经过讨论酝酿，大家弄清了土地应该回家的道理，并向学员讲解土地改革，合理合法，表明民主政府给大家作主的态度，于是大家高兴起来说：“毛主席真是咱的恩人”。所以在毕业典礼的时候，全体学员自然的衷心的给毛主席跪下磕头。关于回去如何工作，各队各组都讨论研究了本村情况。学员回村后，不过五六天光景，全区六个组，就开始行动起来了。
