　　The "Central Daily News" Utters Lament:
    Nanjing 500 Factories and Shops Close
    Is a Signal of Complete Economic Bankruptcy
    Tianjin Labor Strikes Reach 263 in One Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 13th: According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on January 12th: Recently, 500 factories and shops have closed in Nanjing. The Kuomintang's official newspaper, the *Central Daily News*, lamented in an editorial: This matter "is very likely a signal of complete economic bankruptcy in Nanjing." The newspaper estimates that 16,000 workers will face unemployment, and estimates commodity losses at 1.5 trillion. This official newspaper states: Because Nanjing has basically no production to speak of, "even if strict frugality is implemented, Nanjing will not be able to meet supply and demand. But the fact is that not only is there no strict frugality, but there is excessive waste, and the wind of speculation, profiteering, and corruption is rampant, further exacerbating the situation."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 15th: According to news from the Tianjin *Minsheng Daobao* and other sources, labor strikes in Tianjin are continuous. Following the strikes by workers in the eight major factories of the Chiang government's Resources Committee, workers in two rubber factories and the Chiang government's Tianjin Zhongfang No. 4 Factory also launched labor strikes simultaneously on the 6th. Workers in the Feilong and Yuhua rubber factories began a concerted slowdown that day because their demands for improved living conditions and increased annual bonuses were not met. Representatives specially dispatched from the seven factory trade unions went to express their sympathy and condolences. Workers at Zhongfang No. 4 Factory went on strike suddenly on the 4th. It is reported that from November of the year before last to November of last year, there have been as many as 263 labor strikes in Tianjin.

　　《中央日报》发出悲鸣：
    南京五百工厂商店关门
    是经济完全破产的信号
    天津工潮一年达二百六十三次
    【新华社延安十三日电】据合众社南京十二日讯：最近南京有五百家工厂商店关门，国民党机关报中央日报于社论中哀鸣：此事“很可能是南京经济完全破产的信号”。该报估计，有一万六千工人将遭失业，并估计商品损失达一万五千亿，此一官方报纸称：因为南京根本无生产可言，“即使实行严格节约，南京亦不可能供求相洽。但事实是不但没有严格的节约，反而是过度浪费，且投机牟利贪赃枉法之风蜂起，更使形势趋于严重。”
    【新华社延安十五日电】据天津《民生导报》等消息，天津工潮连绵不断。继蒋政府资源委员会八大工厂工人罢工之后，两橡胶工厂及蒋政府的天津中纺第四厂工人又于六日同时掀起工潮。橡胶业飞龙、钰华两厂工人因要求提高生活待遇与增加年赏未遂，于是日开始一致怠工。另有七厂工会特派代表前往作同情的慰问。中纺第四厂工人则于四日突然罢工。按津市自前年十一月迄去年十一月已发生工潮达二百六十三次之多。
