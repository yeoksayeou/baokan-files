　　[Dispatch from this newspaper] A comprehensive TASS dispatch from the 4th to the 9th: The Soviet Union quickly entered a period of economic development during peacetime after the war. Day by day, the basic tasks of the new Five-Year Plan are being realized - restoring the disaster areas within the country, restoring the pre-war industrial and agricultural levels, and greatly exceeding those levels. Last year, all factories completed their annual tasks, and many mining areas exceeded their annual production plans.
　　This year is the second year of the new Five-Year Plan, and major factories are actively arranging their production plans for the year. The Stalin Steel Plant is currently restoring a blast furnace and open-hearth furnace, which will be put into operation together with the rolling mill. At present, the main task of the plant is to restore its pre-war productivity. The Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory is improving various automobiles to make them beautiful and sturdy. The Novoi Ivanovo Textile Factory plans to increase production by at least about 36% compared to last year. The Rostov Shoe and Hosiery Factory will produce at least 2.2 million pairs of shoes and socks this year.
　　More than 200 architects from the Ukrainian Academy of Architecture are busy planning the reconstruction of destroyed Ukrainian towns. A fifteen-year Kiev urban construction plan has been drafted. The paper industry exceeded its production plan by 10% last year, and this year's output will be more than double last year's.
