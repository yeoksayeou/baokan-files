[This newspaper sent from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front on the 5th] Since the self-defense war in the second half of last year, the frontline troops in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region have made many new creations in the political work of the troops. (1) The pre-war mobilization work to stimulate hatred of the enemy and firm fighting spirit has been upgraded from the past "reasoning and making resolutions" to "reasoning and thinking of solutions." Everyone studies and improves the methods of fighting, strengthens mutual assistance in combat, and combines combat mobilization with military training, bravery with technology, and ideological mobilization with organizational work. The "Zhuge Liang Meeting," which is now popular in the troops, is one way to think of solutions. The mobilization slogans are more positive. For example, the previous slogan was "Don't shoot without aiming," but now it is "Aim and shoot, and kill with one shot." It is also very effective to use the realistic atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek army to encourage and mobilize the troops. For example, before a certain unit fought in the Zhangfengji battle, the soldiers heard and witnessed the tragic situation of the Chiang Kai-shek army raping, plundering, and killing, and they all gritted their teeth, vowed to wipe out the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and greatly improved their morale. (2) Military personnel doing political work have also greatly improved the success of political work. For example, Commander Wang of a certain unit often gathers the troops to speak and solve ideological problems. Comrades Wu Si, Zhang Xingchen, Wang Shusen, and others of a certain unit continued to do mobilization and encouragement work in the Zhangfengji battle, which greatly increased the strength of the troops. (3) Whenever there is a central task, after the Party committee has discussed and determined it, the military and political systems combine with each other to create a movement, such as the Wang Keqin movement and the mutual aid movement. At present, all troops are carrying out mutual aid movements. This movement has become the most basic organizational form of the mass line. The leadership's intentions thus form the mass line. With the increasing number of new soldiers and liberated soldiers in the troops, the mutual aid group has become a powerful assistant for leading new soldiers and transforming new soldiers. (4) After each battle, experiences are summarized from the bottom up (starting from a squad), and heroes and models are elected. Such continuous summaries constantly improve the military and political work of the troops, and at the same time, it is also the best post-war mobilization work and re-mobilization in continuous combat, that is, the combination of summarizing experience, post-war mobilization, and re-mobilization. (5) Soldiers liberated from the Chiang Kai-shek army become conscious soldiers after the complaining movement. For example, Han Xinke's complaining in a certain unit recently is the most famous example. (6) In the troop education work, the method of mutual education of three types of people has recently been created, that is, letting the old soldiers talk about the internal life of the Eighth Route Army, the new soldiers in the liberated areas talk about the stories of turning over and the land policy of the Communist Party, and letting the newly liberated soldiers talk about the darkness inside the Chiang Kai-shek army and the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas and the oppression they have suffered; such mutual enlightenment has had great results.

    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front on the 6th] After developing the new method of combat inspection in the Liaocheng Campaign, a certain unit also created a model of combining combat command, political work, and tactics and technology. On the first day of the Liaocheng Campaign, the troops launched a movement of old methods. Squad, platoon, and company mutual aid group leaders, shock troops, grenade throwing groups, bridge-building engineers, artillerymen, firepower teams, and sharpshooters, in groups of three and pairs of two, were active on the front line, observing the terrain, studying the enemy's fortifications, discussing their tasks, and the houses were full of symposiums and discussions, arguing and gesticulating enthusiastically, and everyone was thinking of solutions together. The Fifth Detachment of the unit used 25 people to build a bridge for the first time. Wang Ruixuan, the platoon leader of the Fourth Detachment, went to the automatic hiding place to observe and saw that the bridge had not been built. He led the entire squad of the first platoon to see the terrain and mobilized everyone to think of solutions. The Ding Hongzhang mutual aid group of the first squad, a total of four people, used wooden sticks to tie a model of the bridge and tried to erect it in the courtyard. After discussion and on-the-spot inspection, they proposed to the battalion commander to have four people build the bridge. After consideration, the battalion commander suggested using seven people to build the bridge. Platoon Leader Wang combined the rope pulling method proposed by the battalion commander with the back carrying method of Ding Hongzhang's group, and he himself added the pushing method, negating the lifting method of the Fifth Detachment. After on-the-spot testing, five people completed the bridge-building task that 25 people had not completed, and there were no casualties. Under the enemy's artillery fire, a wooden bridge more than ten meters long was secretly and quickly erected. The method of Wang Ruixuan and Ding Hongzhang's group is a model of the combination of political work, combat command, and tactics and technology. Its foundation is based on a high degree of political responsibility for the victory of the battle, a high degree of bravery, and mass wisdom. Their methods can be summarized as studying experience and lessons, observing on the spot, thinking of solutions together, emphasizing experimentation, criticizing empty talk, and being determined, organized, and planned.

    贯彻群众路线
    领导思想与群众思想结合

    发扬光大人民军队的特质，创造新的作战方法
    【本报冀鲁豫前线五日电】冀鲁豫前线部队在去年下半年自卫作战以来，在部队政治工作上有许多新的创造。（一）激发敌忾心和坚决斗志的战前动员工作，已经由过去的“讲道理下决心”提高为“讲道理想办法”，由大家来研究改进打仗的办法，加强战斗中的互助，把战斗动员与练兵、勇敢与技术、思想动员与组织工作相结合，部队中现在流行的“诸葛亮会”便是想办法的一种。动员口号更为积极，如以前提“不瞄准不打”，现在则提出“瞄准就打，打就打死。”以现实的蒋军暴行对部队进行鼓励动员也很有效，如某部在张凤集战斗前，战士耳闻目睹蒋军奸淫烧杀的惨状，莫不咬牙切齿，誓灭蒋贼，大大提高了斗志。（二）军事人员作政治工作，也大大提高了政治工作的成功。如某部王首长即常集合部队讲话，解决思想问题。某部吴思、张兴臣、王树森等同志，在张凤集战斗中不断作动员鼓动工作，大大增加了部队坚强性。（三）每当一个中心任务，经过党委讨论确定后，军事政治两个系统就互相结合造成运动，如王克勤运动、互助运动。目前各部队都在开展互助运动，这一运动已成为群众路线最基本的组织形式，领导上的意图由此形成群众路线，在部队新战士与被解放的战士日益增多的情形下，互助组已成为带领新兵与改造新战士的有力助手。（四）每次战斗之后即由下（一个班起）而上的总结经验，选举英雄模范。这样的不断总结，使部队军事政治工作不断得到提高，同时也就是最好的战后鼓动工作和连续战斗中的再动员，就是总结经验、战后鼓动和再动员的结合。（五）由蒋军解放过来的战士，经诉苦运动后就变成自觉的战士，如最近某部队的韩新科诉苦，就是最著名的例子。（六）在部队教育工作上，最近创造三种人互相教育的方法，即是让老战士讲八路军的内部生活，解放区的新战士讲翻身故事和共产党的土地政策，让新解放的战士讲蒋军内部和蒋管区的黑暗及他们所受的压迫；这样来互相启发觉悟已收极大效果。

    【冀鲁豫前线六日电】某部在聊城战役中继发挥战斗检查新方法后，又创造出战斗指挥、政治工作与战术技术结合的典型。聊城战役的头一天，部队就展开了老办法的运动，连、排、班互助组长、突击队、投弹组、架桥的工兵、炮手、火力队、特等射手们，三个一组，两个一对的活动在第一线前沿上，观察地形，研究敌人工事，讨论自己所担负的任务，房子里都是座谈会讨论会，热烈的争论着比划着，大家共同在想办法。该部五小队第一次用二十五个人架桥，四小队某排长王瑞轩到自动隐蔽地去观察，见架桥未成，乃带领该排一班全体去看地形，并发动大家想办法，一班丁洪章互助组共四个人用木棍绑成桥的模型在院子里试架，经过争论和实地察看，就向营长提出四个人架桥，营长考虑之后，建议用七个人架，王排长结合了营长提出的绳拉法，加上丁洪章组的人背法，他自己又加上人推法，否定了五小队的人抬法，经实地试验结果，五个人完成了二十五个人所没有完成的架桥任务，而且没有一个伤亡，在敌仕炮火下秘密而且迅速的架好一座十多米长的木桥。王瑞轩和丁洪章组的方法是政治工作、战斗指挥与战术技术结合的典型，它的基础是建立在一切为着战斗胜利的高度政治责任心与高度的勇敢和群众智慧上，他们的方法可以总结为研究经验教训，实地观察，大家想办法，重试验，斥空谈，有决心有组织有计划。
