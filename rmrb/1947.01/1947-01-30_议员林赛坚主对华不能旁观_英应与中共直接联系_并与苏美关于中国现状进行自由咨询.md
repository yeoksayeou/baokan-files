Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Moscow, 27th - According to a Reuters dispatch, the British House of Lords debated British policy towards China on January 23rd. Labor MP Lindsay (previously mistranslated as "Lindsey") suggested that Britain should freely consult with the United States and the Soviet Union on the current situation in China to prevent danger in the region. Lindsay said: "If the Franco government is compared with the Chinese government in its current actions, then the Spanish government is a liberal democratic system. We can no longer take a hands-off approach to the situation in China." Britain must achieve the following goals: to be able to send representatives to Yan'an to establish direct contact with the CCP. He said: "We should be able to obtain information from the original source." Lindsay stated that he now has a very bad impression of the people leading the Chinese government. The weapons handed over to the Chinese government by the Allies have been preserved for the anti-communist war, and it cannot be hoped that Chiang Kai-shek will adopt democratic ideas. Lindsay continued that, according to reliable information he had obtained, in 1943, when the Kuomintang already knew that the Allies would surely win, they transferred their elite troops far away from the front lines of the war against Japan to preserve them for attacking the Communist Party. He also said: "The Kuomintang has established many concentration camps and secret police, and by 1944, at least seventy-two Kuomintang generals had defected to the Japanese side." Lindsay said: "The Chinese Communist Party has long opposed the one-party dictatorship government, and they demand that a coalition government be organized by a considerable number of representatives from the Communist Party, the Kuomintang, and non-party figures." He continued: "In North China, there is a new situation that has never existed in history. Farmers can preserve their land and harvest, and can overcome the disasters that the people of North China have always suffered." Lindsay said: "The Kuomintang has declared that it is the true and legitimate ruling party in China, but this is very doubtful." He suggested that the British government study this issue for a long time.

    议员林赛坚主对华不能旁观
    英应与中共直接联系
    并与苏美关于中国现状进行自由咨询
    【新华社延安二十八日电】莫斯科二十七日广播，据路透社息：一月二十三日英国上院关于英国对华政策进行了辩论，工党议员林赛（前误为“林德西”）建议英国应与美国及苏联关于中国现状问题进行自由咨询，以便预防该地的危险。林赛说：如果拿佛朗哥政府按其现在的行动与中国政府来比较一下的话，那末西班牙政府却是自由主义的民主政治制度。我们对于中国局势不能再采取袖手旁观的立场了。英国必须达到以下的目的，能够派遣代表到延安与中共建立直接联系。他说：我们应当有可能从最初的来源取得情报。林赛声明，他现在对于领导中国政府的人们有一种很不好的印象。盟国交给中国政府的武装，都被保存起来用来进行反共战争，不能希望蒋介石会采取民主的思想。林赛继续说，据他获得可靠的材料证明，一九四三年当国民党已得知盟国必定会胜利时，便将自己的精锐部队调至离抗日前线很远的地方保存起来，以便进攻共产党。并且说：国民党设立了许多集中营与秘密警察，到一九四四年为止，至少已有七十二个国民党将军跑到日本方面。林赛说：中国共产党早在反对一党专政的政府，他们要求由共产党、国民党及非党人士相当数量代表组织联合政府。继说：在华北已经有一种有史以来未有的新的情况，农民得以保存自己的土地与收成，并且能够克服华北人民从来所经受的灾难。林赛说：国民党曾声明它是中国真正的合法当权政党，但是这是很可怀疑的。他建议英国政府长期研究这一问题。
