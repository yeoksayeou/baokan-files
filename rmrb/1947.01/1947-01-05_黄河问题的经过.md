The Course of the Yellow River Problem
    Newspaper Archives

    How the Yellow River Problem Began

    On January 11th of last year, six individuals including Mr. Tarde, an American advisor to the Kuomintang government's Yellow River Commission, suddenly arrived in Heze from Kaifeng. They stated that their purpose was to inspect the old dikes of the Yellow River. Our JiluYu Administrative Office immediately provided them with accommodation and led them to inspect the breach in the Jiangsu dike near Linpuji. They only stayed in Heze for two days before leaving without saying goodbye. Soon after their return, Kuomintang newspapers spread rumors, falsely accusing our democratic government of obstructing the inspection of the old dikes of the Yellow River, and therefore decided not to restore the dikes but to block the breach first. Subsequently, preparations were made to block the breach at Huayuankou, and the news that "the Yellow River diversion project could be completed in two months" was repeatedly announced in newspapers both domestically and abroad. From then on, the Yellow River problem officially began.

    At that time, our liberated area's democratic government, although deeply aware that the return of the Yellow River to its old course would bring disaster to the people of the JiluYu and Shandong liberated areas, agreed in principle to this move in order to take care of the people in the new flood areas of Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, and was willing to actively participate in this work. However, it firmly opposed the Kuomintang's conspiracy to "divert the river and shift the disaster" without restoring the dikes. This was because the Yellow River had been diverted for eight years, and the riverbed was several feet above the ground, with more than 1,700 newly built villages on it. The so-called river course had long existed in name only. Moreover, the old dikes along the entire 2,000-plus li (Chinese miles) of the riverbank were now severely damaged and in urgent need of repair. This project was enormous and could not be completed in a few months. Our liberated area, after eight years of resistance against Japan and three years of famine, was certainly unable to complete this project independently.

    Therefore, our JinJiLuYu Border Region Government, in addition to actively seeking negotiations with the Yellow River Commission, decided to establish a Yellow River Committee in the JiluYu area. After urgent preparations, the committee was officially established in Heze on February 22nd, and immediately began to widely recruit river management personnel, plan dike restoration projects, survey the damage to the dikes on both banks, investigate the number of villages and populations between the two dikes, and plan for relocation and relief.

    However, the Kuomintang government did not consult with our side and held a groundbreaking ceremony at Huayuankou on March 1st to begin blocking the breach. When the news came, the masses in the counties along the river in the border region were extremely alarmed. The border region government and the council sent telegrams to the Yellow River Commission and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), presenting our views, and specially sent Chao Zhefu, Jia Xinzai, Zhao Mingfu and other three representatives to Bian (Kaifeng) for negotiation.

    Preliminary Kaifeng Agreement

    The three representatives, Chao Zhefu and others, set out for Bian on March 23rd. On March 25th, when passing through Anyang, they were subjected to unreasonable obstruction and slander by the 40th Army. After our three representatives repeatedly questioned and protested, they were illegally detained for three days before being escorted to Bian by Mr. Kong and Mr. Wang from the Yellow River Commission.

    After days of negotiations between our representatives and Zhao Shouyu, chairman of the Yellow River Commission, and others, a preliminary agreement on river management was formally signed in Kaifeng on April 7th. The important contents were threefold: First, blocking the breach, restoring the dikes, and dredging the river should proceed simultaneously, but the blocking of the breach should be stopped to a certain extent, waiting for the completion of the river management project before continuing construction; the final blocking of the breach should never occur before the full completion of dike restoration and river dredging. Second, the river management organization should be based on the principle of unity and cooperation, with personnel from both sides participating in the work. Third, the relocation and relief funds for the riverbed residents should be submitted to the government by the Yellow River Commission for approval as a special project, and relief should be sought from UNRRA and CNRRA at the same time.

    First Yellow River Survey and Heze Agreement

    On April 8th, the Yellow River Survey Team, jointly formed by Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Commission, Advisor Tarde, UNRRA Investigation Commissioner Han Liting, Advisor Fan Mingde and others, started from Kaifeng, surveyed the river course along the south bank of the Yellow River, and arrived at Heze. The next day, they continued to survey eastward along the river, passing through seventeen counties, and returned to Heze after completing the survey on the 15th. Along the way, the masses petitioned one after another, unanimously requesting the government to cherish the lives of the people and not to close the river and release the water before the dikes were restored.

    As a result of the survey, everyone agreed that the dikes along the river were too severely damaged. Even Zhao Shouyu admitted that more than 30% of the main dikes needed to be repaired. Therefore, on the same evening (15th), the "Heze River Management and Diversion Agreement" was jointly signed by Zhao Shouyu and other seven members of the Yellow River Commission and representatives of the JiluYu and Bohai Administrative Offices of our liberated area. The main points were as follows: 1. Closing the river and releasing water will be done after the completion of dike restoration, river dredging, straightening of bends, and consolidation of dangerous works. 2. The Yellow River Commission shall request the Executive Yuan to allocate 100,000 yuan in legal tender per person as relocation fees for the newly built villages in the riverbed. 3. The Yellow River Commission shall apply to UNRRA and CNRRA for relief on behalf of the villages. 4. The directors and deputy directors of the Shandong and Hebei dike defense offices will be appointed by the Yellow River Commission and the liberated area government respectively.

    Kuomintang Breaks Agreement and Continues to Intensify Breach Blocking

    Unexpectedly, CNRRA was unwilling to implement the Heze Agreement. It insisted on the two-month breach blocking plan and continued to intensify the breach blocking at Huayuankou. Zhao Mingfu, our border region's representative to the Yellow River Commission in Kaifeng, immediately questioned the Yellow River Commission, and on the 20th, he went to Huayuankou to discuss with Lin Kaijia, Wang Yunqing and other representatives of the Yellow River Commission and the Henan Kuomintang authorities again. It was decided that before the flood season, only the east and west dike heads should be reinforced, and the river should be closed and the water released after the restoration of the downstream dikes, river dredging, and repair of dangerous works were completed sequentially. However, the Kuomintang authorities did not express their agreement, so it was decided that all parties would discuss and resolve the matter again on May 8th.

    On the 28th, Bai Chongxi personally inspected the Yellow River breach blocking project at Huayuankou. After the inspection, he immediately went to Xinxiang to inspect the "reorganization" of the troops. This was obviously a Kuomintang conspiracy to use the Yellow River breach blocking to coordinate with its military offensive and achieve the poisonous plan of flooding seven million people along the river in our liberated area. Therefore, the meeting convened on the 5th ended without any results because the Kuomintang Central Government insisted on the two-month breach blocking plan. We then decided to send Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi as two representatives to Beijing to negotiate with the Kuomintang Central Government.

    On the 10th, the spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a statement on the Yellow River issue, firmly opposing the Kuomintang's vicious plan to deliberately flood our liberated area, and calling on people at home and abroad to uphold justice, stop the Huayuankou breach blocking project, and thoroughly implement the Heze Agreement.

    Nanjing Agreement

    After Zhao Mingfu and Wang Xiaoyi arrived in Beijing, they held formal meetings with representatives of the National Water Conservancy Commission, the Yellow River Commission, UNRRA, and CNRRA at the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan on the 17th and 18th after much negotiation. As a result of the negotiation, the following agreement was obtained: 1. Downstream urgent dike restoration projects, including dangerous works and partial river channel consolidation, should be completed as soon as possible, and the overall project should be planned and promoted in conjunction. UNRRA and CNRRA should prioritize and expedite the supply of necessary matching materials, labor, and food; the Water Conservancy Commission should fully allocate the necessary funds. Efforts should be made to start construction before June 5th. 2. Regarding the relocation and relief of residents in the river channel, the Yellow River Commission has already submitted a request for approval, and the Central Government should expedite the approval process. 3. The breach blocking project should continue, based on the principle of not causing flooding downstream.

    On the same day, Comrade Zhou Enlai, the representative of the CPC delegation, also reached an oral agreement with Mr. Frank and Mr. Tarde, representatives of UNRRA, as follows: 1. Downstream dike restoration and river dredging should overcome all difficulties and start construction as soon as possible. 2. All materials, labor, and food needed for the project should be supplied by UNRRA and CNRRA, and should not be affected by any military or political factors. 3. CNRRA should establish an office in Heze to handle the supply of materials, with the participation of the CPC. 4. The relief for the relocation of river channel residents should be handled by a committee organized by all parties. The committee should be composed of two people appointed by the government, two people appointed by the CPC, and one person each appointed by UNRRA and CNRRA. 5. Before June 15th, no diversion canals should be dug below Huayuankou, and the Xinbian Railway and highway should not be dismantled. Changes can only be made after June 15th, depending on the progress of downstream projects, after consultation between the two parties. 6. Piling should continue. Whether to throw stones or not should be decided after consultation between the two parties before June 15th, depending on the progress of downstream projects. If it is decided to throw stones, the limit should not exceed two meters below the riverbed. These two agreements were repeatedly considered by Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Xue Dubi and guaranteed to be thoroughly implemented.

    At the same time, our representatives also discussed the supply of materials and equipment with UNRRA and CNRRA in Beijing, agreeing that the first batch of funds of 1 million yuan and 6,000 tons of flour (later increased to 25,000 tons) would be transported to Heze and Huimin respectively in the near future. The relocation fee for riverbed residents was also agreed upon as 1.5 million yuan.

    Our Side Starts Dike Repair on All Fronts, Kuomintang Delays Material Supply

    On May 26th, 20,000 workers in Juancheng, Dongming and other counties began to repair the dikes. On June 10th, a full-scale construction began, with more than 230,000 people repairing the dikes, completing more than 390,000 cubic meters of earthwork in five days.

    However, the Kuomintang did not implement the Nanjing Agreement and guarantee various supplies. The Ninth Working Team of the Henan Branch of CNRRA arrived in Heze on June 1st. Wang Hechen and Peng Anjie, representatives of CNRRA and UNRRA stationed in Heze, also arrived here on May 24th and June 1st respectively. However, as of the 14th, in addition to only 300 tons of flour being transported, no public funds, medicine, relocation fees, or various materials needed for the project had been transported. This not only hindered the speed of the dike repair project, but also caused many dike repair workers to fall ill. In Yunbei section, 600 people fell ill in a few days, accounting for 43% of the total number of dike repair workers in the county.

    Because the Kuomintang's supply was not guaranteed, the dike restoration project was seriously affected. Therefore, in accordance with the Nanjing Agreement, at the meeting held in Kaifeng on June 15th, the two parties agreed to postpone the discussion and decision on the dike mouth issue to July 1st.

    After this, although our representatives repeatedly contacted, urged, and discussed in Beijing and Bian, the Kuomintang adopted a policy of pushing, delaying, and denying everything, refusing to allocate funds on time. Our area's river repair workers were unable to sustain themselves and were finally forced to stop work completely at the end of June.

    Kuomintang Breaches Agreement and Throws Stones Without Authorization

    However, on June 22nd (ten days before the July 1st discussion), the Kuomintang threw stones at Huayuankou without notifying our side. Although our representatives protested to the Kuomintang repeatedly in Beijing and Bian, the Kuomintang completely ignored them, continued to throw stones stubbornly, and actively prepared to excavate diversion canals, dismantle the Xinbian Railway and highway, and close the river and release the water.

    As the flood season approached, the river water rose sharply. The wooden piles and stone dams at the Huayuankou breach blocking site were successively washed away by the river water. The Kuomintang intensified the rescue and desperately filled in for more than twenty days without any success, and was forced to stop the breach blocking project.

    On July 19th, Comrade Zhou Enlai flew from Beijing to Bian and personally inspected the breach blocking project at Huayuankou. On the 20th, he also attended the Kaifeng Yellow River Symposium. With the unanimous agreement of representatives from all parties, it was formally decided to stop the breach blocking before the flood season.

  The Yellow River Problem is Shelved

    In late July, the Yellow River flood season arrived, and most of the Huayuankou breach blocking project was washed away. The Kuomintang's conspiracy to close the river and release the water was temporarily halted.

    In early August, the Kuomintang launched a large-scale offensive on the Longhai Railway against our JiluYu Liberated Area, and the supply of materials was completely cut off, and the dike restoration project in our area was also suspended. Moreover, the UNRRA and CNRRA offices stationed in Heze received orders from UNRRA and CNRRA in Kaifeng on August 27th to withdraw to Kaifeng, but our side repeatedly tried to retain them without success.

    The Yellow River problem for half a year was completely shelved as a result of the Kuomintang's military blockade and offensive against the border area.

　　黄河问题的经过
    本报资料室
    黄河问题是怎样开始的
    去年一月十一日，突有国民党政府黄委会美籍顾问塔德等六人，由开封来荷泽，声言此来系察看黄河旧堤，我冀鲁豫行署当即予以招待，并领他们到临濮集附近江苏堤决口处察看。他们在荷泽仅停留了两天，即不辞而别。他们回去后不久，国民党报纸便造谣诬我民主政府阻挠，使黄河旧堤无法勘察，故决定不行复堤而先堵口。接着，就在花园口准备堵口，并在中外各报一再宣布“黄河改道工程能于两个月完成”的消息。从此，黄河问题就正式开始了。
    当时，我解放区民主政府虽然深知黄河归故后，对冀鲁豫与山东解放区人民，会带来灾难；然而为了照顾豫、苏、皖黄河新汛区人民，在原则上是赞成此举的，并愿积极参加此项工作。但是，对于国民党不复堤即堵口的“移河移祸”的阴谋是坚决反对的。因为黄河改道已有八年之久，河床高出地面几在一丈以上，其上新建村庄已有一千七百多个，所谓河道早已名存实亡。且全岸二千余里的旧堤坝，现亦已破毁不堪，亟需修补，而此项工程浩大，决非几个月所能完成。我解放区经八年抗战，三年灾荒，更决无独立完成此项工程之可能。
    因此，我晋冀鲁豫边区政府除积极设法争取与黄委会进行商谈外，决定先在冀鲁豫区成立黄河委员会。该会经紧急筹备，于二月二十二日在荷泽正式成立，并立即开始广延治河人材，计划复堤工程，勘查两岸堤埝破坏情形，调查两堤间村庄人口数目，策划迁移及救济事宜。
    但是，国民党政府并不与我方洽商，即于三月一日，在花园口举行破土典礼，动工堵口。消息传来，边区沿河各县群众莫不惊骇万分，边区政府及参议会乃一面致电黄委会及救济总会，提出我方意见，一面特派晁哲甫、贾心斋、赵明甫等三代表，赴汴商谈。
    开封初步协议
    晁哲甫等三代表于三月二十三日首途赴汴，二十五日行经安阳，饱受四十军之无理留难与污蔑，经我三代表复词质问抗议，乃在非法扣留三日之后，始由黄委会孔、王两先生陪同抵汴。
    经我方代表与黄委会委员长赵守钰等连日谈判，四月七日，在开封正式签订治河初步协议，重要内容有三：第一，堵口与复堤、浚河并进，但堵口到一定程度即行停止，等待治河工竣，再继续动工；在复堤、浚河未全部完成前，绝不最后堵口。第二，治河机构应本统一合作原则，由双方参加人员办理。第三，河床居民之迁移救济费，一面由黄委会拟呈预算，专案呈请政府核拨；一面则分向行总、联总申请救济。
    首次勘黄与荷泽协议
    四月八日，由黄委会委员长赵守钰、顾问塔德、及联总调查专员韩立亭，顾问范铭德等十人联合组成之黄河勘查团，由开封沿黄河南岸勘察河道到达荷泽。次日，继续沿河东下勘查，经十七县，于十五日勘查完毕返回荷泽。沿途各地群众纷纷请愿，他们一致要求政府爱惜民命，在未复堤前不要合龙放水。
    勘查结果，大家一致认为：沿河堤坝破毁太甚，即赵守钰亦承认百分之三十以上的大堤必须修补。因此，乃于当晚（十五日），由黄委会赵守钰等七人，与我解放区冀鲁豫、渤海两行署代表，共同订立“荷泽治河改道协议”。其要点如下：一，复堤浚河，裁弯取直，整理险工等工程完竣后，再行合龙放水；二，河床内新建村庄，由黄委会呈请行政院每人拨发迁移费法币十万元；三，由黄委会代请联总、行总救济；四，冀鲁两省修防处正副主任，由黄委会及解放区政府分别派人担任。
    国民党破坏协议，继续加紧堵口
    不料，国民党行总不肯执行荷泽协议。依然坚持两月堵口计划，继续在花园口加紧堵口。我边府驻开封黄委会代表赵明甫当即向黄委会提出质问，并于二十日至花园口，与黄委会及河南国民党当局代表林开甲、王芸青等再度商议。决定：堵口部分大汛前只加培东西堤头，俟下游复堤，浚河、修理险工等工程依次完竣后，再合龙放水。但，国民党当局并不表示同意，故又决定于五月八日再由各方商谈解决。
    二十八日，白崇禧亲往花园口视察黄河堵口工程，视察后，并立即转赴新乡视察部队“整编”情形，此显系国民党阴谋以黄河堵口，来配合其军事进攻，达到淹害我解放区沿河七百万人民的毒计。因之，五日召开的会议，便因国民党中央坚持两月堵口计划，商谈毫无结果。我乃决定派赵明甫、王笑一两代表赴京与国民党中央进行协商。
    十日，中共中央发言人对黄河问题发表谈话，坚决反对国民党此种蓄意淹我解放区的恶毒计划，要求国内外人士主持正义，制止花园口堵口工程，彻底实行荷泽协议。
    南京协议
    赵明甫、王笑一、两氏抵京后，经多方商谈，十七、十八两日在行政院水利委员会，与全国水委会、黄委会，联总及行总代表正式开会，商谈结果获得如下协议：一、下游急要复堤工程，包括险工及局部整理河漕，尽先完成，同时规划全部工程衔接推进。所需配合之器材工粮，请联总、行总优先尽速供给；所需工款，则由水利委员会充分筹拨。争取于六月五日以前开工。二、河道内居民迁移救济问题，黄委会已呈请有案，请中央从速核定办理。三、堵口工程继续进行，以不使下游发生水害为原则。
    同日，中共代表团周恩来同志与联总代表福兰克芮及塔德二先生亦获得口头协议如下：一、下游复堤浚河，应克服一切困难从速开工。二、工程需要之一切器材、工粮，由联总、行总供给，不应受任何军事政治影响。三、行总为办理器材物资之供应事项，在荷泽设立办事处，由中共参加。四、河道居民迁移之救济，由各方组织委员会负责办理，该委员会由政府派二人，中共派二人，联总、行总各派一人组织之。五、在六月十五日前，花园口以下故道不挖引河，新汴铁路及公路不得拆除。至六月十五日，视下游工程情形，经双方协议后始得改变之。六、打桩继续进行，关于抛石与否，须待六月十五日前视下游工程进行情形，然后经双方协议决定，如决定抛石，亦以不超过河底两公尺为限。该两协议并经马歇尔、周恩来、薛笃弼再三考虑，确实保证彻底执行。
    同时，我方代表并在京与联总、行总商谈了物资器材供应问题，商定第一批工款一百万万元，面粉六千吨（后增至二万五千吨），于最近分别运抵荷泽、惠民。河床居民迁移费亦经商妥为一百五十万万元。
    我方全线动工修堤，国民党拖延供给物资
    五月二十六日，鄄城、东明等县两万工人开始动工修堤。六月十日，全线一齐大动工，修堤群众在二十三万人以上，五天内就突击完成三十九万余方土。
    但国民党却不执行南京协议，保证各种供给。行总河南分署第九工作队六月一日就到达荷泽，行总及联总驻荷办事处代表王贺宸、彭安杰，亦先后于五月二十四日及六月一日来此，然至十四日止，除只运来面粉三百余吨外，其他公款、医药，迁移费以及各种工程需要之器材，尚未运来分毫。这样，不仅阻碍了修堤工程速度，且使修堤工人病倒者比比皆是。郓北段几天内就病倒六百人，占该县修河工人总数的百分之四十三。
    因为国民党供给毫无保证，复堤工程受到严重影响，故遵照南京协议于六月十五日在开封召开的会议上，关于堤口问题，经双方约定延迟到七月一日再行商谈决定。
    此后，各种物资供应，虽经我方代表在京、汴两地，多次接洽，催促、商谈，而国民党则一概采取推、拖、赖的办法，不肯按期拨付。我区修河工人因无力支持，终于被迫在六月底全部停工。
    国民党违约擅自抛石
    然而，国民党竟于六月二十二日（离七月一日之商谈尚有十天），未通知我方，就在花园口擅自抛石。我方代表虽在京、汴两地，向国民党一再提出抗议，国民党完全置之不理，悍然继续抛石，并积极准备挖掘引河，拆除新汴铁路及公路，进行合龙放水。
    由于大汛将临，河水陡涨，花园口堵口处之木桩、石坝相继被河水冲毁，国民党于加紧抢险，拼命填补二十余日毫无成就后，被近停止堵口工程。
    七月十九日，周恩来同志由京飞汴，亲往花园口视察堵口工程，二十日，并出席了开封黄河座谈会。始在各方代表一致同意下，正式决定在大汛前停止堵口。
  黄河问题就此搁浅
    七月下旬，黄河大汛到临，花园口堵口工程大部都被冲毁，国民党之合龙放水阴谋，至此才暂告停顿。
    八月初，国民党在陇海线向我冀鲁豫解放区大举进攻，物资供应因而完全断绝，我区复堤工程亦随遭停顿。且联总、行总驻荷泽办事处，复于八月二十七日，接获开封联总、行总命令撤回开封，我方一再挽留未果。
    半年来的黄河问题，遂因国民党对边区施行军事封锁与进攻的结果，而完全搁浅了。
