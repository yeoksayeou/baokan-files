　　Economic Crisis in the KMT-Controlled Areas Before the Lunar New Year

　　Due to Chiang Kai-shek's pursuit of treasonous, dictatorial, and civil war policies, the economy of the KMT-controlled areas is on the verge of total collapse. The rumors of a "year-end crisis" have long been rampant in cities like Nanjing and Shanghai.

　　According to estimates from November last year, the KMT government's fiscal budget for the latter half of the year showed a deficit of over 11 million trillion yuan in just eight provinces and cities including Sichuan and Shanghai. The KMT government had ordered the collection of 80% of the land tax by November last year and the full amount by December, but according to the *Peace Daily*, only 3.6% of the national land tax had been collected by November 7th. In Shaanxi Province, only one-fifth of the total amount had been collected by November 11th. Sichuan, the province with the highest land tax quota, had only collected 3.6 million *shi* (石, a unit of dry measure) by mid-December, accounting for only 20% of the total. The reactionary KMT authorities' harsh taxes and levies have aroused widespread opposition among the people. Most counties in Sichuan Province have not yet reported the start of tax collection, while more than 80 counties have reported disasters to the provincial government and requested tax reductions and exemptions. In December, Hewengji in Weixian, Shandong, went on strike, with slogans like "Demand a reduction of the people's burden" posted all over the streets. The Shanghai Book Industry Union sent representatives to Beijing again to petition for exemption from business tax. In December, the Tea Industry Union also went to Beijing to petition due to excessive donations and taxes. On November 28th, various businesses in Changchun petitioned the KMT government of the city due to the heavy business tax. An old man from a trade association exclaimed: "Even during the puppet Manchukuo era, there weren't such heavy taxes!" In addition to the exorbitant taxes and levies, the conscription of men has been rampant, leading to the escape of young men in the KMT-controlled areas of the Northeast and the abandonment of farmland. In the 35th year of the Republic (1946), the KMT-controlled areas had a total of 500 million *mu* (亩, a unit of area) of wasteland, and the number of starving people exceeded 100 million.

　　The KMT government's vicious inflation has reached an unfathomable level. In July and August of last year, 1 trillion yuan was issued each month, and in September, it doubled. In addition to the Central Printing Plant now producing more than 23 billion yuan in paper money daily, the Central Bank has also ordered a large batch of new banknotes from the UK. On November 19th last year, British merchant ships and shipping company vessels arriving in Shanghai brought more than 1,250 boxes of new banknotes from the UK. As of the 19th, the number of new banknotes shipped from the UK to Shanghai had reached 10,000 boxes. Due to the extreme inflation, the KMT currency has plummeted to an unprecedented low. According to the Associated Press, on December 21st last year, the US dollar in Shanghai rose to 7,300 yuan, more than double the 3,350 yuan when the foreign exchange rate was adjusted on August 19th.

　　Reports state that since the signing of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty, American goods have flooded into China in even greater quantities. Recently, 87 American ships fully loaded with goods shipped from the US to China have arrived, with 20 of them arriving at the Wusongkou on the 12th. Another 800 American ships will continue to sail to China, each carrying an average of 8,000 tons of cargo.

　　With the large-scale dumping of American goods and the monopolistic dominance of bureaucratic comprador capital, reports state that more than 1,600 factories and businesses in Shanghai alone have closed down in the latter half of last year. Since the autumn of last year until the Lunar New Year, more than 27,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in the KMT-controlled areas have closed down. Even the flour industry, which was once known as "everyone else withering, only it flourishing" in Shanghai, has fallen into a slump. At the end of October last year, more than 20 famous companies such as Fuping and Fuxin announced their closure. China's largest New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory also closed down due to a loss of 2.7 billion yuan. Of the 23 paper mills in Shanghai, only six are operating intermittently, while the rest have closed down. In addition, more than 100 companies, businesses, and factories have requested to close down. According to Associated Press estimates, after the Lunar New Year, 30% to 40% of businesses in Shanghai will declare bankruptcy. The director of the Economic Administration Department of the Shanghai KMT Social Bureau also admitted that at least 3,000 factories and businesses will inevitably close down by the end of the year.

　　In December, 338 dyeing and weaving factories in Wuxi, Suzhou, Yushan and other places are closing down one after another. In Suzhou, more than 110 stores have closed down in the past month. In Nanjing, 500 factories and stores have recently closed down. It is estimated that 16,000 workers will face unemployment, and the loss of goods will reach 1.5 trillion yuan. In Hangzhou, since the implementation of goods taxation in October last year, in just over a month, 28 pharmacies alone have closed down. In addition, the number of cloth, silk, and grain businesses that closed down in October last year and have been registered with the municipal government has reached 24. In order to save the economic crisis before the Lunar New Year, the industrial and commercial circles in Fuzhou obtained approval from the KMT Ministry of Finance to organize a syndicate of seven banks and money shops to borrow 1.05 trillion yuan from the Central Bank, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not help.

　　Due to the severe economic crisis, domestic funds have been fleeing to Hong Kong. According to unofficial statistics from Shanghai financial circles, as of October 21st last year, the total amount of domestic funds fleeing to Hong Kong was close to 100 billion yuan. In December, the amount of funds fleeing to Hong Kong reached more than 40 billion yuan, an increase of 10 billion yuan compared to November.

　　Due to the successive closures of industrial and commercial enterprises, the number of unemployed workers has increased sharply, the living conditions of workers have deteriorated, and labor unrest has surged. The Tianjin Eight Factories under the KMT Resources Committee went on strike for a week from November 17th last year due to the factory's reduction of wages. Following this, workers from two other rubber factories and the Fourth Factory of the KMT government's Tianjin China Textile Company also launched labor unrest at the same time. All 700 male and female workers of the East Asia Tobacco Company under the KMT government's Ministry of Economic Affairs in Qingdao have been on strike since November 14th. The city's printing workers also went on strike on November 14th because their demand for increased wages was not met. Shanghai newspapers reported that in November last year, workers in the printing industry and several tobacco companies in Shanghai launched a movement to demand increased wages. More than 50,000 workers in more than 500 printing factories and wood carving workers demanded an increase in base pay and petitioned the Social Bureau and negotiated with the employers, but there were no results. Workers in more than 30 silk weaving factories in Shanghai have become involved in a labor unrest demanding year-end bonuses and have launched a "slow strike." It is expected that this strike will spread to other factories.

　　It is estimated that at least 20,000 of the 1 million people in Guangzhou and Kowloon are unemployed. In Shanghai, according to the Shanghai Police Bureau, a total of 839 suicide cases occurred from January to October last year, the most of whom were unemployed. The number of poor people who died on the streets is also alarming. The number of corpses collected by a charitable organization, the Pushan Villa, reached 15,293 in just eleven months last year.

　　旧历年关前蒋管区的经济危机
    由于蒋介石进行卖国独裁内战，蒋管区经济已处于总崩溃的前夜，“年关危机”的风声，在京沪各地早已甚嚣尘上了。
    据去年十一月间估计：蒋政府财政预算去年下半年仅四川、上海等八省市共不敷一千一百余万万元之巨。蒋政府曾限令于去年十一月间收足田赋百分之八十，十二月收齐，但据和平报载：截至十一月七日全国田赋只收到百分之三点六，陕西省至十一月十一日仅收达全数的五分之一。征粮数额居第一位的四川，直到十二月半亦仅收到三百六十万石，仅占总额的百分之二十。反动的国民党当局的苛征暴敛，已引起人民普遍反对。四川省大多数县份尚未报告开征，向省府报灾请求减免的却有八十多个县局。山东潍县河瓮集于十二月间罢市，街上满贴“要求减轻人民负担”的标语；沪市书业工会为请免营业税，再度推派代表赴京请愿；十二月间茶业工会亦因捐税过重，赴京请愿。十一月二十八日，长春市各商号因营业税苛重，向该市国民党政府请愿，某同业公会一老先生大呼：伪满时代也没有过这样重的税！除苛捐杂税外，加以大肆抓丁，东北蒋管区青壮逃亡，耕地荒芜。三十五年度蒋管区共荒地五万万亩，饥民超过一万万人。
    蒋政府的恶性通货膨胀已达到不可知的数字，在去年七、八月份各发一万亿元，九月份骤增一倍。而现在除由中央印刷厂每日即出纸币二百三十余亿元外，复由中央银行向英国订制大批新钞。去年十一月十九日到沪之英商船和洋行轮船中即由英运来新钞一千二百五十余箱。截至十九日止，由英运沪之新钞已达一万箱之谱。因通货之极度膨涨，蒋币空前惨跌，据合众社消息：去年十二月二十一日，上海美钞涨达七千三，较之八月十九日调整外汇时之三千三百五高一倍多。
    报载自蒋美商约签订后，美货更大量倾入中国。最近由美输华满载货物之美轮八十七艘，已有二十艘于十二日抵达吴淞口，另有美轮八百艘，亦将继续驶华，每艘平均装货达八千吨之多。
    在美货大量倾销，和官僚买办资本的独占垄断之下，据报载：上海一地去年下半年来，工厂商号倒闭者已达一千六百余家。自去年入秋以来，迄旧历年关前，蒋区工商倒闭二万七千余家。沪市向称“众枯独荣”之一的面粉业亦陷不景气，去年十月底著名的阜平、福新等二十余家均告停闭。中国最大之新亚药厂亦因亏蚀二十七亿元关门。沪市二十三家造纸厂除六家时开时停外，余均停业，另更有百余家公司商号工厂请求歇业。据合众社估计，年关后，沪市将有百分之三十至四十企业宣告破产。沪蒋记社会局经济行政处长亦承认，年底势将倒闭工厂商号至少在三千家以上。
    十二月、无锡、苏州、虞山等地染织厂三百三十八家，正在相继停业。苏州一月来商店倒闭即达一百一十余家。南京最近有五百家工厂商店关门，据估计将有一万六千工人遭遇失业，商品损失将达一万五千亿。杭州自去年十月间实行货物征税后，一月多光景，单药行倒闭者即有二十八家，此外布、绸、粮等业去年十月份倒闭数已在市政府备案者达二十四家。福州工商业为挽救旧历年关经济危机，经呈准蒋记财部，由七家银行，钱庄组织银团，向中央银行贷款十亿五千万元，但，杯水车薪，亦无济于事。
    由于经济危机严重，国内资金纷纷逃港，据上海金融界非正式统计：截至去年十月二十一日止，国内资金逃港总数逼近千亿元。十二月份逃港资金为数达四百余亿元，较十一月份增加一百亿元。
    由于工商业相继倒闭，失业工人大增，工人生活恶化，工潮亦汹涌澎湃起来。国民党资源委员会所属天津八大工厂，因厂方减低工资，于去年十一月十七日起罢工一周。接着，另两橡胶工厂及蒋政府的天津中纺公司第四厂工人，又于同时掀起了工潮。青岛蒋政府经济部所属东亚烟草公司全体七百余男女工人，已自十一月十四日起罢工，全市印刷工人因要求增资不遂，亦于十一月十四日起罢工。沪报载：去年十一月间上海全市印刷业和几家烟草公司等的工人均掀起要求增资运动，五百余家印刷厂工人五万余人，与木器雕刻工人均要求增加底薪，曾向社会局请愿及与资方谈判，尚无结果。上海三十余家丝织工厂的工人卷入要求年终分红的工潮，已发动“慢性的罢工”，预料这一罢工将普及其他工厂。
    据估计：广九两市一百万人口中失业者起码在两万以上。在上海，据沪警局公布，自杀案件自去年一月至十月共发生八百三十九件，其中以无职业者为最多。贫民倒毙街市者数目亦惊人，仅一家慈善机关普善山庄收葬的路尸，去年十一个月内，即达一万五千二百九十三具。
