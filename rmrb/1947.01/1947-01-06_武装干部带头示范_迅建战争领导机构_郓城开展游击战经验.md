[This dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu [short for Hebei-Shandong-Henan] Bureau] During the 39 days that Chiang's troops occupied Yuncheng, our guerrilla warfare gained the following three experiences: (1) In the initial development of guerrilla warfare, because the political cadres and militia lacked experience in this area, armed cadres (such as the county brigade) should play a leading role, and in tense situations, automatically set out to investigate the situation, influencing others. And in each action, it is necessary to grasp specific examples and carry out demonstration education for general cadres and militiamen, so that they can constantly gain experience. (2) Strike the worst elements, grasp the key points for struggle, in order to transform the struggle situation. For example, Wang Yuekui, the puppet township head of Wushawu in the first district, forced members of the peasant association to surrender and repent, overturned land and grain, and demanded three times the amount in return for one. We resolutely attacked him and vigorously supported the masses, so that other bad elements did not dare to move. (3) Boldly change the organizational form to suit the needs of the war. For example, the county established two command headquarters in the east and west, and established armed work teams to lead the masses in the struggle against the enemy.

    武装干部带头示范
    迅建战争领导机构
    郓城开展游击战经验
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】在蒋军侵占郓城的三十九天中，我游击战获得如下三点经验：（一）在最初开展游击战争时，因政权干部和民兵对此无经验，所以武装干部（如县大队）应起带头作用，在紧张情况下，自动出发侦察情况，影响别人。并且在每次行动时要抓紧具体实例，对一般干部和民兵进行示范教育，使他们不断取得经验。（二）打击最坏的分子，抓紧重点进行斗争，以转变斗争形势。如一区五沙窝伪乡长王月奎，强迫农会员自首悔过，倒地倒粮，吃一还三，我们便坚决打击他，大力的给群众撑腰，其他坏蛋也就不敢动了。（三）大胆的改变组织形式，以适合战争的需要，如该县曾建立东西两个指挥部，并成立武装工作组，领导群众进行对敌斗争。
