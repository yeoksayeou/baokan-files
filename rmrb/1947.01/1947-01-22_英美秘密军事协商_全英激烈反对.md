Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: London Dispatch: On December 2nd of last year, the Associated Press of America sent out a message stating: "According to authoritative sources, Anglo-American military and political leaders have reached a principled agreement on the unified organization of the two countries' land, sea, and air forces." This news sparked fierce opposition from the British people. Newspapers blazed headlines such as "Shameful!", "Undignified!", and "Disgraceful!". Members of Parliament demanded that Attlee attend Parliament to report. However, when Parliament convened on December 9th, Attlee did not dare to show his face and instead sent the Lord President of the Council, Morrison. When Morrison was cornered by a Member of Parliament, he claimed, "I have not seen this kind of news." This further激化the situation, and some Labour Party Members of Parliament requested a meeting with the Prime Minister and handed Attlee the original Associated Press dispatch. Attlee was finally forced to attend Parliament on December 12th. Members of Parliament then questioned him one after another. Labour Party Member of Parliament, Weizler, also demanded in his speech that Attlee guarantee that the government would not sign a military treaty with the United States or any other country without the consent of Parliament. Attlee's response to this request was still ambiguous, which greatly dissatisfied Labour Party Members of Parliament.

　　英美秘密军事协商
    全英激烈反对
    【新华社延安十七日电】伦敦航讯：去年十二月二日美联社由美国拍出消息谓：据权威方面宣称：“英美两国军政领袖关于两国陆海空军统一编制，已获原则协议”的消息传到英国后，引起了全英人民的激烈反对，报纸上大字标着“可耻啊”！“失体统啊”！“丢脸啊”！一类的标题，但议员们要求艾德礼出席国会报告。可是在十二月九日国会开会时，艾氏竟不敢露面，改由枢密大臣摩利逊出面，摩氏被一位议员追问得无办法时，竟称：“没有看到这一类的消息”。于是群情益形激昂，一部分工党议员要求首相接见，并以一份美联社的原稿交艾氏，艾氏被迫终于不得不在十二月十二日出席国会。议员们乃纷起质问，工党议员惠司勒并在发言中要求艾氏保证政府在未得国会同意之前，不得与美国或其他任何国家签订军事条约。艾氏在答复此项要求时仍模棱其词，工党议员大为不满。
