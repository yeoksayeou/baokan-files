　　General Gao Shuxun's New Year's Eve Talk
    Chiang Kai-shek Determined to Continue Dictatorial Rule
    The People's Construction Army Will More Actively Strike at Traitors
    【Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Lu Ming, 30th Report】On the eve of New Year's Eve, this reporter specifically inquired of General Gao Shuxun on several issues in the current situation. General Gao said: The Nanjing pseudo-National Assembly closed at the end of the year and formulated a pseudo-constitution. This shows that the dictatorial group is determined to carry out civil war and national betrayal to the end, and is determined to continue the situation in which China after the Northern Expedition was divided by a majority of warlords and transformed into a dictatorial rule by two warlords. I still remember a year ago, when my troops revolted in Handan and withdrew from the civil war, I still hoped that Chiang Kai-shek would cease the civil war and build the country democratically. Unfortunately, in the past year, what Chiang Kai-shek has done is as cruel as Yuan Shikai, and he has abandoned himself to the people of the country. At this critical juncture of the decisive battle between democracy and dictatorship, saving the country and betraying the country, the Democratic National Construction Army will not only passively withdraw from the civil war, but will also be more courageous in protecting the country, saving the people, and striking at traitors. Our task is to make China a democratic and independent country and establish a democratic coalition government. Therefore, we are willing to join hands with any party, army, or individual who is fighting for this goal. Over the past year, the Democratic National Construction Army has transformed from an old army into an armed force for the people and loving the people. We have fully developed the patriotic and people-saving tradition of the Northwest Army. Over the past year, the Democratic National Construction Army has been deeply loved and helped by the people and government of the Liberated Areas, and has had sincere and friendly relations with the people of the Communist Party of China. On this basis, our future progress will accelerate the realization of our mission.

　　高树勋将军除夕谈话
    蒋介石决心继续独裁统治
    民建军将更积极打击叛逆
    【新华社特派记者鲁明三十日报导】除夕前夕，记者特以目前时局中若干问题询诸高树勋将军，高将军称：南京之伪国大，适于岁末闭幕，且制定了一部伪宪法，这表示了独裁集团将决心内战卖国到底，决心将北伐后中国由多数军阀割据，变为二个军阀的独裁统治的局面继续下去。犹忆一年以前，我部邯郸起义退出内战时，当时还希望蒋介石息手内战，民主建国。无奈这一年来，蒋介石所作所为，实酷如袁世凯一样，而自弃于国人。在这民主与独裁，救国与卖国的决战关头，民主建国军不只是消极的退出内战，而将是更勇敢的去护国救民，打击叛逆。我们的任务，在使中国成为一民主独立的国家，建立一个民主的联合政府。故凡为此目的而奋斗的党派、军队、个人，我们均愿与之携手并进。一年多来，民主建国军已经从一个旧的部队，转变成一个为人民与爱护人民的武装。我们充分的发挥了西北军爱国救民的传统精神。一年多来民主建国军深获解放区人民与政府的爱戴与帮助，获得中共人士诚恳友爱的相处。在这些基础上，我们未来的进步将加速我们的任务的实现。
