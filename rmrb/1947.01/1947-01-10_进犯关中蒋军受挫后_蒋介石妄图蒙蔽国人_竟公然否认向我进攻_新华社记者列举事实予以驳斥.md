Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. After Jiang Hu's troops launched another large-scale attack on our Guanzhong Partition on the 29th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense military spokesman publicly denied it on the 4th of this month, saying, "There is absolutely no such thing as the National Army attacking Guanzhong"; Xinhua News Agency reporters commented on this: Chiang Kai-shek ordered his spokesman to deny after about four brigades attacked the border area and suffered setbacks, attempting to cover up the truth and deceive the people. But the result is just a futile attempt to conceal. After Jiang Hu's troops attacked Guanzhong in early December last year and were repelled by us, they actively re-assembled their forces and deployed to attack again; before the 28th of last month, the 123rd Brigade, 368th Regiment, and 367th Regiment, the 143rd Regiment of the 48th Brigade, the 495th Regiment of the 165th Brigade, and the 3rd Security Regiment of the Jiang army in the east of Guanzhong had gathered around Tongguan, Yaoxian, and Yijun; in the west, the 142nd Regiment of the 48th Brigade, the 2nd Independent Regiment of the 36th Division, and the 35th Regiment of the 12th Brigade had gathered in Zhengning and Gouyi; in the south, the 4th and 10th Security Regiments of the enemy were concentrated in Tongrun and Tuqiao towns in Chunhua; at the same time, on the 26th, the Jiang army used more than 200 trucks to transport ammunition from Sanyuan to Tongguan and Yaoxian, and the Jiang government in Tongguan, Gouyi, and Chunhua ordered each Bao to prepare 30 to 50 head of livestock to speed up the transportation of grain. After the Jiang army completed various preparations for the attack, on the 29th, it invaded our border area from seven locations in the east, south, and west of Guanzhong, 30 to 40 miles away, only 50 miles away from the Malan City, where the Guanzhong Special Office is located. After our military and civilians resolutely resisted, although the enemies on all routes have been frustrated, they still occupy important military locations such as Qiutou in Xinzheng County (more than 20 miles south of Tongguan County in the Jiang District) and Mount Wenwang (30 miles west of Tongguan County in the Jiang District), and are rushing to build fortifications, rushing to transport ammunition, and accompanying Baojia personnel to capture and kill our rural cadres and masses, forcibly issuing house numbers, and forcing Baojia, preparing to continue the invasion. In this invasion of our Guanzhong Partition by the Jiang army, more than 100 villages and towns have been affected, and the losses of the masses are worth more than 100 million yuan in legal tender. Wherever Jiang Hu's troops went, they were almost completely massacred. Their cruelty and loss of humanity were worse than the three-all policy of the Japanese invaders. For example, when the enemy occupied Yangjiadianzi in the Malan District of Xinzheng County, this peaceful and happy small village of fifteen households had its houses burned, its food robbed, and its livestock taken away. Eleven old, weak, women and children who had not been transferred were brutally murdered, including an infant less than two months old and a Liu's little daughter, Lancao. After Jiang Hu's troops shot and killed villager Dang Furong, they cut off his ears and lips for fun. This kind of crazy beast behavior fully exposes the ugly and brutal nature of Jiang Hu's traitorous civil war policy. Now, in order to decorate the facade of his so-called "political settlement" and obtain more help from his American daddy to expand his civil war dictatorship, Chiang Kai-shek has to try his best to conceal his attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. But the fact is still the fact, and Chiang Kai-shek's tricks, in addition to exposing his extreme boredom, strengthen the Chinese people and democratic people of all countries' hatred for him, and there will be no other result.

    进犯关中蒋军受挫后
    蒋介石妄图蒙蔽国人
    竟公然否认向我进攻
    新华社记者列举事实予以驳斥
    【新华社延安七日电】上月二十九日蒋胡军再度向我关中分区大举进攻，但蒋介石之国防部军事发言人于本月四日竟公然否认，说：“国军攻击关中一说，绝无此事”；新华社记者对此评称：蒋介石此次以约四个旅进攻边区，受挫后才令其发言人出来否认，妄图以一手遮天，蒙蔽国人。但结果只是欲盖弥彰。按自去年十二月初蒋胡军进攻关中被我击退后，即重行积极集结兵力布署再犯；上月二十八日以前，关中东面蒋军一二三旅三六八团、三六七团，四十八旅一四三团，一六五旅四九五团及保三团等，已集结同官耀县宜君一带；西面则有四十八旅一四二团，卅六师独立二团及十二旅卅五团等，已集结于正宁、枸邑一带；南面敌保安第四团第十团集中于淳化之通润土桥等镇；与此同时，二十六日蒋军用载重汽车二百余辆由三原满载军火运抵同官、耀县一带，同官枸邑、淳化蒋政府复下令每保准备三十至五十头牲口，加紧赶运粮秣。蒋军于完成各项进攻准备后，二十九日即由我关中东、南、西三面，从七处侵入我边境三、四十里，距我关中专署所在地之马栏市仅五十余里，经我军民坚决抗击，各路敌人虽已受挫，但现仍占领我新正县湫头（蒋区同官县南二十余里），及文王山（蒋区同官县西三十余里）等军事要地，正赶筑工事，赶运军火，并随带保甲人员捕杀我乡村干部及群众，强发门牌，强制保甲，准备继续进犯。蒋军此次进犯我关中分区，先后受害之村镇即达百余处，群众损失共值法币十余万万。蒋胡军所到之处，几乎全遭血洗。其残酷与丧失人性，较日寇之三光政策有过之无不及。如敌占我新正县马栏区杨家店子时，此一十五户人口之一和平安乐小村庄，房子被烧光，粮食被抢光，牲口被拉光，未及转移之老弱妇孺十一人均被惨杀，内中尚有出生未满两月之婴孩及刘姓小女儿兰草。蒋胡军将村民党富荣枪杀后，还割下他的耳朵与嘴唇以取乐，这种疯狂兽行，充分暴露蒋胡卖国内战政策之丑恶残暴。现在，蒋介石为装璜其所谓“政治解决”的门面，取得其美国爸爸更多的帮助以扩大其内战独裁，故而不能不百般掩饰其向陕甘宁边区之进攻。但事实终究是事实，蒋介石的骗术除了暴露其无聊已极，更加强中国人民和各国民主人士对其厌恨外，再不会有别的任何结果。
