    Taihang District Party Committee Issues
    Decision on Rectifying Organ Production
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] On the 17th, the Taihang District Party Committee issued the "Decision on Rectifying Organ Production," stating: In the past, organ production (referring to commercial production) in this district played a role in prospering the market, fighting the enemy economically, reducing the burden on the people, and improving the lives of troops, organs, and the masses. As it has developed, some organ production personnel have become self-important, failing to obey market management and leadership, leading to several deviations and becoming an obstacle to economic development. It is necessary to quickly rectify this: (1) Except for production by troop organs, which is managed uniformly by the troops, production by Party, government, civilian organs, and teams will be managed uniformly by the District Party Committee, the Secretariat of the Prefectural Committee, and the general affairs departments, organized into a management committee. This will be done according to unified living standards, with regular planning and inspection. At the county level, a management office will be established for unified operation, with each unit investing shares and receiving dividends. Commercial production at the district level will be completely stopped, and shares will be invested in the county management office. Handicraft and workshop production can remain unchanged. Individuals are absolutely prohibited from engaging in commercial production. (2) Obey the leadership of the local government, and are not allowed to enjoy any privileges. All obligations are the same as private merchants. Organ production personnel are not allowed to include on-the-job personnel, are not allowed to wear military uniforms or carry guns, and are not allowed to demand services. All enemy and puppet property taken without authorization in the past must be returned to the public. Relevant departments should immediately discuss and implement this decision. At the same time, mobilize cadres to respond to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call for hard work and struggle, lower living standards, and practice strict economy, in order to reduce the burden of organ production tasks.
