　　Military Region Field Political Department Issues Notice
    Strengthening Support-the-Government and Cherish-the-People Work
    [This newspaper's report from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 19th] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Field Political Department, responding to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call for this year's ten major tasks, issued a notice on the 11th regarding support-the-government and cherish-the-people work, stating: The first half of the lunar New Year month is the "Support-the-Government and Cherish-the-People Month," a period of concentrated effort for support-the-government and cherish-the-people work. Commander-in-Chief Zhu instructed that support-the-government and cherish-the-people work is one of this year's ten major tasks. Our frontline troops, even in the midst of frequent combat, should not relax this work. The methods of carrying out support-the-government and cherish-the-people work should be adapted to the circumstances of marching or combat life. Now, we call on all frontline troops to: (1) Utilize lulls in combat to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, as well as the instructions of leaders Liu, Deng, and Zhang on rectifying discipline; launch mass discussions, criticisms, and commendations; and call for meritorious service in support-the-government and cherish-the-people work, and conduct elections for support-the-government and cherish-the-people models. (2) Based on the above inspections, further conduct education and formulate concrete measures for further improving military-civilian relations in the future. (3) Pay attention to strengthening mass work. In the future, guide all food units to establish mass work units, without hindering combat training tasks, to conduct propaganda work and investigation work. In newly recovered areas, pay attention to listening to the people's accusations against the Chiang troops, and stir up a fervor to avenge the people and ourselves.
