The Jinji-Luyu Military Region announced the year-round battle achievements of the Taihang and Taiyue militia, and on New Year's Day, issued a circular to commend the model militia, guerrillas, and enemy-killing heroes in the entire region. These published materials demonstrate the great strength and brilliant achievements of our people's armed forces. In a year of patriotic self-defense war, they not only undertake the sacred tasks of stabilizing rear area order, persisting in border area struggles, defending their hometowns, and defending the fruits of struggle, but also, tens of thousands of them go to the front lines to cooperate with the regular army in combat, and with miraculous actions, advance into the enemy's rear, threatening the heart of the Chiang army, accumulating small victories into large victories, constantly eliminating the enemy, and seizing weapons from the enemy to arm themselves. Taking the Taiyue region's militia as an example, they created the glorious record of independently fighting 4643 times, cooperating with the main force 403 times, killing and wounding 8062 enemy troops below the regimental commander level, capturing 97 bunkers, seizing 1 American-made rocket launcher, 3 mortars, 43 light and heavy machine guns and submachine guns, and 1510 rifles and carbines. This shows that the people's armed forces have become one of the important factors in winning the patriotic self-defense war.

To welcome the new year of struggle and the victory of the patriotic self-defense war that must come, the people's armed forces of the entire region must continue to exert their greater strength:

(1) The people's armed forces of the entire region should continue to improve their combat effectiveness, strengthen combat, and promote the role of militia work teams and militia guerrilla joint defense teams, cooperate with the main force in combat, go deep into the enemy's rear to widely carry out the "anti-settlement" offensive, resolutely crack down on "settlement teams" and "returning home corps," suppress the worst traitors, evil gentry, and settlement leaders, unite the vast majority of the people, organize the masses in the occupied areas, organize open and secret struggles, oppose the reactionaries' plunder of manpower and material resources, defend the fruits [of victory], persist in democratic power, and prepare for the counter-offensive. The experience of the past year has proved that the social power of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries is very small and very fragile. With the tenacious combat power of our people, there is no situation that cannot be opened up and no fortress that cannot be breached.

(2) Universally launch the new heroism and merit-making movement. We suggest that each region conduct a summary movement every year, and must give the model militia teams and enemy-killing heroes the rewards and commendations they deserve.

(3) Seize all gaps in time to carry out rectification and training, launch mass military training movements, give play to one's special skills, and delve into self-study movements. The organization of the militia must be systematically reorganized on the basis of land reform, so that our people's armed forces are firmly in the hands of liberated peasants and tested mass leaders.

(4) The people's armed forces must actively participate in land reform and filling-in movements, and on the basis of completing land reform, strive to participate in this year's large-scale production movement. Military force and labor force must be combined, and the militia must be a laboring militia. He is both a laborer and a combatant. He should work hardest to produce and care about the interests of the people, practice production and frugality, and wage a resolute struggle against all waste and idleness. Years of experience have proven that the militia's enemy-killing hero is bound to be a labor model, otherwise he is not worthy of being called a hero. The Third Company of the Juancheng Militia is a good example.

    人民的力量是不可侮的
    晋冀鲁豫军区公布了太行、太岳民兵的全年战绩，又于元旦日通令嘉奖全区模范民兵、游击队、杀敌英雄，这些公布的材料，显示出我人民武装的伟大力量与辉煌成就。在一年爱国自卫战争里，他们不仅担负着安定后方秩序，坚持边地斗争，保卫家乡，保卫斗争果实的神圣任务，而且，成千成万的奔赴前线，配合正规军作战，并以神奇动作，挺进敌后，威胁着蒋军的心脏，积小胜为大胜，不断的消灭敌人，从敌人手里夺取武器来武装自己。仅以太岳区民兵为例就创造了单独作战四六四三次，配合主力作战四○三次，毙伤敌团长以下八○六二人，攻克碉堡九七座，缴获美制火箭炮一门，迫击炮三门，轻重机枪、手提机枪四十三挺，步马枪一五一○支…………的光辉记录，这说明人民武装已成为争取爱国自卫战争胜利的重要因素之一。
    迎接新的斗争年份，迎接一定要到来的爱国自卫战争的胜利，全区人民武装必须继续发挥其更大的力量：
    （一）全区的人民武装，应继续提高战斗力，加强战斗，发扬民兵武工队，民兵游击队联防队的作用，配合主力军作战，深入敌后广泛开展反“倒算”攻势，坚决打击“倒算队”“还乡团”，镇压最坏的汉奸恶霸和倒算头子，团结最大多数的人民，组织沦陷区的群众，组织公开与秘密的斗争，反对反动派的人力物力掠夺，保卫果实，坚持民主政权，准备反攻。一年来的斗争经验证明了，蒋介石反动派的社会力量是非常狭小，非常脆弱的，以我们人民的顽强的战斗力量，没有不可打开的局面，没有不可攻破的堡垒。
    （二）普遍开展新英雄主义和立功运动，我们建议各区，每年来一次总结运动，必须对模范的民兵队和杀敌英雄给以应有的奖励和表扬。
    （三）抓紧一切空隙时间进行整训，开展群众性的练兵运动，发挥一技之长，深入自学运动。对民兵的组织必须在土地改革的基础上进行有计划的整理，使我们的人民武装，确掌在翻身农民和经过考验的群众领袖手里。
    （四）人民武装必须积极参加土地改革和填补运动，并在完成土地改革的基础上，努力参加今年的大生产运动，武力劳力必须结合，民兵必须是劳动的民兵，他是劳动者又是战斗员，他应该最努力生产并关怀人民大众的利益，励行生产节约，与一切浪费游怠现象作坚决的斗争。多年的经验证明：民兵的杀敌英雄必然又是劳动的模范，否则他就不配称英雄，鄄城民兵第三连就是好榜样。
