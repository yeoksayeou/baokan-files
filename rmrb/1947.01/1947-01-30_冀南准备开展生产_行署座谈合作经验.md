    Southern Hebei Prepares to Launch Production
    Administrative Office Holds Symposium on Cooperative Experience
    [This dispatch from Weixian, 27th of this month] In order to launch the large-scale production movement this year, the Southern Hebei Administrative Office convened a symposium of cooperative chairpersons from Linqing and Qiu County on the 7th of this month. Everyone believed that cooperatives have achieved considerable success in recent years. The Qiu County Cooperative organized mass transportation, helping the masses overcome the disaster. When the masses found it difficult to get medical treatment, they organized medical cooperatives, solving the problem of the masses asking doctors for medicine. Members bought things at lower than market prices, giving the masses considerable benefits, and especially supporting and developing the sideline production of the masses in more than a dozen villages. The Xiangchenggu Cooperative, in order to support the production of poor villages, specifically allocated funds to organize transportation for poor villages. The Diaozhuang Cooperative in Linqing, in order to solve the problem of farm tools for the masses, opened an iron factory, which produced eighty cotton-ginning bows and three thousand plows this year. These are all achievements in serving the masses. At the same time, the meeting also examined the biases and shortcomings of the cooperatives, the main one being the lack of a clear perspective on serving the masses. The Xiangchenggu Cooperative once had a purely profit-oriented view, believing that supporting sideline production was not profitable. Diaozhuang once developed operations similar to the small-scale cooperatives in Taihang, establishing group-based rural sideline production organizations, from which the masses profited greatly, but the leadership of the cooperative believed that it was not as profitable as the cooperative's own operations, so it abandoned group operations and went down the wrong path of purely cooperative operations, so that the masses' group operations did not develop, and the masses' shares were not large, and no foundation was laid. Based on the above situation, the meeting pointed out that cooperatives must serve the people, and cooperatives must clarify the policy of supporting farmers' sideline production. In order to develop rural sideline production, Xiangchenggu proposed that vigorously supporting the development of the textile industry is very good. It universally called on the masses to buy shares, and members must buy things cheaper than the market price. The meeting also emphasized the development of group operations, organizing mass production mutual aid groups from group operations to village cooperatives, to district and county cooperatives. Without group operations, there is no mass foundation for cooperatives. Finally, the meeting emphasized that the leadership should establish a democratic system, and carry out the cooperative movement under the clear policy that "cooperatives must serve the people and be led by the people at the same time."

    冀南准备开展生产
    行署座谈合作经验
    【本报威县二十七日电】为开展今年的大生产运动，冀南行署于本月七日召开临（清）、邱（县）合作社长座谈会。大家认为数年来，合作社已有了不少的成绩；邱县合作社组织群众运输，使群众渡过了灾荒。群众觉得治病困难，则组织医药合作社，解决了群众请先生买药的困难。社员买东西低于市价，给群众以不少的便宜，特别支持和发展了十几个村的群众副业生产。香城固的合作社，为了扶植贫村的生产，特抽出资金组织贫村运输事业。临清刁庄合作社，为了解决群众农具的困难，开设了铁工厂，今年生产了八十张弹花弓，三千张犁，这都是为群众服务的成绩。同时该会又检查了合作社的偏向和缺陷，主要是为群众服务的观点不明确。香城固合作社曾一个时期有单纯的营利观点，认为支持副业生产不赚钱。刁庄曾一个时期发展了与太行小型合作社相似的经营，建立了小组的农村副业生产组织，群众获利大，但社的领导上认为不如社营赚钱多，遂放弃了组营，走上单纯社营的湾路，以致群众组营没有发展起来，群众的股金不大，没有打下根基。根据以上的情形，会议上指出了合作社必须为人民服务，合作社必须明确支持农民副业生产的方针。为了发展农村的副业，香城固提出了大力支持纺织业的发展是很好的。普遍号召群众入股，社员买东西一定贱于市价。会议上又强调指出了发展组营，组织群众生产互助小组从组营发展起村合作社，到区县合作社。没有组营，就没有合作社的群众根基。最后会议上强调了领导上要建立民主制度，在“合作社要为人民服务，同时又被人民所领导”的明确方针下，开展合作社运动。
