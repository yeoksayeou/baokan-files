    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 5th] The logistics work in the Yuanqu Campaign this time was done relatively well. The reasons are: 1. The military and government jointly formed a logistics command to unify leadership. With the Yuanqu County government as the core, a logistics command was formed, with the county head as the commander-in-chief, and the troops sent personnel from the mass work department and the supply department to participate. All the troops needed, whether it was food, forage, or civilian labor, was allocated through the logistics command to the supply stations, in an orderly and organized manner. The participation of military personnel in the logistics command allowed them to understand the situation, preventing waste and not affecting the troops' combat and daily life. 2. Decentralized mobile supply stations were organized, consisting of cadres from counties, districts, and villages who were detached from production, directly under the leadership of the county logistics command. After the troops entered Yuanqu, the supply stations were scattered in the troops' stationed areas, and the army could receive grain and grass nearby. A certain detachment commander marched a long distance and arrived at Dashiya at 7:00 PM, and had finished dinner by 9:00 PM. When the troops advanced, each station guaranteed supplies and civilian labor mobilization. 3. Yuanqu has a population of only 50,000. Except for the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek's army, the actual population under our government's leadership is only 13,000. Therefore, it was necessary to mobilize civilian labor in nearby counties, such as Yangcheng, Wangwu, and Qinshui. Due to the large mobilization area, the number mobilized in each county was very small. Yangcheng mobilized civilian labor to participate in the Yuanqu campaign, accounting for only 7% of the total population, which did not affect land reform and winter production. 4. Special care was given to the masses from other counties who participated in the war. The logistics command stipulated that the masses from other counties who participated in the war should bring their own supplies for six days. For those exceeding six days, the troops were responsible for receiving grain, at the rate of one and a half jin of millet per person per day, and one to two jin of firewood without pricing. Problems such as housing, straw bedding, and pots and bowls were also fully supplied. The masses from Yangcheng and other counties who participated in the war also ate white flour and pork.

    垣曲后勤工作经验
    军政合组后勤指挥部
    成立分散流动供应站
    【本报太岳五日电】这次垣曲战役中，后勤工作做得较好，其原因：一、军政合组后勤指挥部统一领导。以垣曲县政府为核心，组成后勤指挥部，县长为总指挥，部队派民运部、供给部人员参加。部队所需不论粮秣民力，都经过后勤指挥部到供应站去拨，次序井然不紊。后勤指挥部有部队人员参加了解情况，不会浪费亦不影响部队作战生活。二、组织分散流动供应站，由县区村脱离生产的干部组成，直接受县后勤指挥部领导，部队进入垣曲后，供应站分散于部队驻处，军队可以在附近领到粮草。某支队长途行军，下午七时到达大石崖，九时便吃完晚饭。当部队前进时，各站保证供给与民力动员。三、垣曲仅五万人口，除蒋军侵占区外，实际在我政府领导下的人口，仅一万三千人，因此需在附近县份，阳城、王屋、沁水等六县动员民力，由于动员面积大，每县动员的数量很小，阳城动员参加垣曲战役的民力，只及全人口百分之七，未影响土地改革和冬季生产。四、特别照顾外县来的参战群众，从外县来的参战群众，后勤指挥部规定自带给养六天，超过六天的由部队负责领粮，每人每天小米一斤半，柴火一斤至二斤不发价。住房子铺草锅碗等问题，亦充分供给，阳城等县参战群众，还吃到了白面猪肉。
