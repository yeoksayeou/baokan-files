Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang Front, 10th. Chiang Kai-shek's troops, a part of the 61st Brigade of Hu Zongnan's 90th Division, counterattacked a high ground outside Puxian city retaken by the Eighth Route Army on the evening of the 1st, but were repulsed. At the same time, the Eighth Route Army guerrillas launched a guerrilla war in the Baijiayuan area, ten miles north of the city, to strike at the Chiang Kai-shek troops returning to the city. At dawn on the 5th, the 140th Regiment of the 47th Brigade of Hu's army stationed in Daning, with four mountain guns and six mortars, invaded Ducun, ten miles northwest of Daning, in several routes. The Eighth Route Army resisted heroically and repulsed the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops. During this period, the Eighth Route Army guerrilla forces maneuvered closer to the Tongpu Road and, on the 5th, recovered Wan'an Town, twenty-five miles northwest of Hongdong, and Denglinshan Village (both more than ten miles southwest of Zhaocheng), and other Yan puppet strongholds, capturing more than 50 officers and soldiers of the Yan puppet Security 14th Regiment.
