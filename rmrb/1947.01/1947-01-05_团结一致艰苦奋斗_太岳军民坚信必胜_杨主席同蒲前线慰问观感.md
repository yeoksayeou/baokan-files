Unite and Work Hard
　　Taiyue Military and Civilians Firmly Believe in Victory
　　Impressions of Chairman Yang's Visit to the Tongpu Frontline
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 31st] Chairman Yang Xiufeng of the Border Government personally visited the military and civilians on the Tongpu front line to express his condolences to those who had been fighting on the self-defense battlefield for half a year. After half a month, he told reporters his impressions of this trip, saying: "The most profound impression along the way is that everyone has a high degree of confidence in defeating the Chiang troops." Following this, Chairman Yang, in an excited tone, cited each corps of our troops, enthusiastically carrying out the movement to annihilate the enemy and establish meritorious service. After receiving combat missions, soldiers always competed with each other to rush to the battlefield. From cadres and soldiers to cooks, many combat heroes and model workers emerged. The high morale fully demonstrated the spirit of a victorious army. In the heat of the land reform movement, the emancipated peasants had a high degree of understanding of the self-defense war, shouting slogans to defend the fruits of their struggle by joining the army and participating in the war. They traveled three or four hundred miles to the battlefield, regardless of fatigue. Logistics work coordinated with the troops' operations and achieved victory. Hospitals near the battlefield, under difficult conditions with limited tools and medicines, medical workers actively tried to ensure that most of the wounded were quickly treated and discharged. For example, in × place, there were very few medicines, but 80% of the wounded in that place were cured and discharged. At this point, Chairman Yang also cited the achievements of labor heroes in the whole region in supporting the war and leading production. For example, Shi Zhenming launched large-scale textile transportation to support the front line, overcoming various difficulties. Chairman Yang said with certainty and excitement: "Such vigorous morale and popular support are actually due to the masses' turning over and defending their own interests, and also understanding the truth that our army's operational policy does not lie in the gains and losses of a city or a place, but in annihilating the enemy's vital forces." Chairman Yang also said: "This truth is also grasped by war support personnel, government, and other organs, which is reflected in their ability to combine it with our army's spirit of cherishing the people, to carry out unified leadership and precise calculations for cherishing the people's strength, and has achieved great results. Saving one-third of the people's strength in the front is something that we should pay special attention to and promote in the future." Chairman Yang then praised the Party, government, army, and people for deeply understanding the long-term nature of the self-defense war and for establishing a work style of hard struggle. The × Special Commissioner's Office, in order to adapt to the wartime environment, lived in a small village of eight families. The simplicity of the tools is self-evident, but the staff did not let this hinder their work. Chairman Yang said: "This kind of hard-working and simple style can provide some advice for those who only think of big cities." Finally, Chairman Yang talked about the land reform in the border areas, which has been launched in conjunction with guerrilla warfare. He said hopefully: "This movement will undoubtedly spread to all occupied areas of Chiang and Yan, and become another fatal blow to the Chiang and Yan troops." (Wei Jin)
