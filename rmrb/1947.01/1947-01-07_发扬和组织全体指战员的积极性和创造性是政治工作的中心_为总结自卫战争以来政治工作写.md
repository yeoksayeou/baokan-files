Developing and Organizing the Initiative and Creativity of All Commanders and Fighters Is the Core of Political Work
    —— Written to Summarize Political Work Since the Self-Defense War
    Zhang Jichun
    The patriotic self-defense war against Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous dictatorship is a war completely integrated with the interests of the people and their army's commanders and fighters, a major undertaking for the people and their army's commanders and fighters themselves. The people and their army's commanders and fighters fully support the patriotic self-defense war. The experience of the past six months of the self-defense war has fully demonstrated that, whether it is to guarantee the completion of combat missions and training missions, or to complete tasks such as uniting officers and soldiers, uniting the military and the people, and disintegrating the enemy army, as long as the initiative and creativity of all commanders and fighters are developed and organized, and the enthusiastic support of the vast number of commanders and fighters is obtained, there will be strength and methods, and everything can be done well, and done very well. Otherwise, if we do not or do not pay enough attention to developing and organizing the initiative and creativity of all commanders and fighters, and do not obtain the enthusiastic support of the vast number of commanders and fighters, there will be no strength, fewer methods, and all work will be done poorly, or not very well. Therefore, it is very necessary for us to recognize this link in our work and grasp it firmly.
    Regarding the development of the initiative and creativity of all commanders and fighters to complete tasks in all aspects, this point is generally acknowledged by everyone, but it is not so easy to do, and requires us to study and research it profoundly. How exactly do we develop the initiative and creativity of all commanders and fighters in our work? According to what we have already experienced, we must first have a mass perspective in our guiding ideology, believing that the vast number of commanders and fighters have wisdom and strength, believing that all aspects of the army's tasks can be completed with the active participation of the vast number of cadres and soldiers, and cannot be completed by a few, and relying on the majority of the vast number of commanders and fighters at all times and in all places.
    With a mass perspective, we can further establish a work style of approaching the masses, going deep among the masses, and understanding the situation of each cadre and soldier at all times. The war situation is very tense, and the changes are very fast and numerous. The army's composition alone is constantly changing, and the thoughts and feelings of the army's cadres and soldiers in the war are often very different. They may have various different understandings and attitudes towards the current situation, Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, the well-equipped Chiang army, technical and tactical training, the orders of superiors, newly recruited soldiers and newly liberated comrades, their hometowns, the common people, and enemy officers and soldiers. Which of those understandings and attitudes are in line with the Party's policies and their own interests, and which are not? We must promptly understand and determine them, especially after a tense battle situation. It is impossible to obtain timely understanding if we do not approach the masses, do not go deep among the masses, and are isolated from above and below.
    After going deep among the masses and promptly understanding the situation of the army's cadres and soldiers, we do not follow the tail of the masses, tolerate or accommodate the masses' incorrect ideas, nor do we rely solely on orders to force the masses to execute (naturally, the execution of orders is very important in the army). Instead, we adopt the method of timely persuasion and guidance to transform them, especially through the influence of progressive elements among the masses, mutual education, and mutual assistance, creating a mass upsurge of justice, creating an upsurge of fighting to the end to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, an upsurge of uniting the people and resolutely implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, an upsurge of propagandizing and disintegrating enemy officers and soldiers, and implementing the policy on prisoners of war, and an upsurge of everyone learning from and supporting new heroes and models. In this way, we cultivate and create a lively, fighting, training, and tense atmosphere in all aspects of the army's work. The 8th and 9th Regiments’ morale was low after the Wangjiazhai battle, but they were successfully transformed through a bottom-up mass combat review and the combination of specific current affairs education. Their high tide of learning enthusiasm was immediately transformed into full combat enthusiasm. After fighting the 3rd Division, the 11th Division, and the 5th Army, the commanders and fighters of all units felt the importance of overcoming the enemy's artillery fire and fortifications. As a result, the masses researched and developed many good methods for avoiding enemy artillery fire and destroying enemy fortifications in discussions. The research of technology and tactics greatly improved, and the confidence in victory and combat effectiveness greatly improved. Recently, even methods for digging fortifications and using machine guns in winter have been researched by the masses. For a period of time, many cadres and veteran soldiers felt that new soldiers were a burden in battle, and generated some feelings of dislike. Later, after mass discussions, this was transformed. Everyone believed that as long as they patiently helped the new soldiers and educated the new soldiers to study hard themselves, the new soldiers could quickly learn to fight. Wang Keqin's model squad was produced and discovered on this basis.
    Once the initiative and creativity of the army's cadres and soldiers are developed, through the wisdom and creative ability of the masses, good methods for internal unity, mutual assistance, combat, training, and disintegrating the Chiang army will inevitably be created. At the same time, countless outstanding heroes and models in various aspects will inevitably emerge. Here, there are examples of mass combat reviews combining current affairs education and ideological education, model mutual assistance groups for training, consolidating the army, and combat, model company commanders, instructors, and a large number of platoon leaders and squad leaders, a large number of combat heroes, many resourceful reconnaissance personnel, sharpshooters, engineer heroes, actively working propaganda groups, military instructors, and painters loved by commanders and fighters, models of security work, and many model doctors, nurses, sanitation chiefs, medics, and medical workers. At this time, the leader's responsibility lies in promptly discovering and introducing these good methods, good typical examples, and various heroes and models for everyone to learn from, so that they can become widespread and push the entire work forward. This is also one of the main methods for us to train cadres and solve the cadre problem in the war. However, we have not done enough and not universally enough in this regard in the past. This is still due to insufficient contact with the masses.
    To go deep among the masses, understand the masses, solve problems among the masses, inspire the initiative and creativity of the vast number of commanders and fighters, create a mass upsurge of fighting, training, and all aspects of work, and to emerge heroes and models in all aspects of work, it cannot be achieved without the unified and centralized leadership of the Party committee and its military and political organs. The Party committees at all levels must rely on their understanding of the current tasks and the actual situation of the army, promptly stipulate the key points of military and political work, mobilize the strength of the military and political organs, and work together in a coordinated manner around a certain center. Whether it is the combat, propaganda, or organizational departments, they all cooperate like a rhythmic piece of music. If the Party committee and the military and political organs are not good at concentrating and allocating their guiding forces, and are not good at developing and relying on these forces, they are also not good at relying on the masses. As a result, their leadership intentions and thoughts will inevitably not be transformed into the intentions and thoughts of the masses. The military and political work organs naturally have their different scientific divisions of labor, but it is difficult to separate military and political workers in their actual work. Every military person must be concerned about the ideological problems in every aspect of his work when he is carrying out military work, and first concentrate his efforts on solving the ideological problems among the masses, so he cannot but participate in political work. Especially military commanders at all levels, when they pay attention to political work and first conduct their work ideologically, their work tasks are often completed smoothly and better. The same is true for political workers. Naturally, they must focus on inspiring the masses politically and ideologically, and develop the initiative of the masses, but they must also be concerned about military work and understand military work. The purpose of developing the fighting initiative of commanders and fighters is to win battles, so they cannot but know how to conduct battles, know what kind of combat methods should be adopted against the current enemy, and promote those combat methods. To develop the initiative and creativity of commanders and fighters in training, they cannot but know how to conduct training, and widely promote and introduce new creations and models in training. Because poor combat methods and unskilled techniques directly affect the success or failure of battles, and also affect the initiative of commanders and fighters and the completion of the political tasks of the people's self-defense war. This is what everyone calls "the combination of courage and technique." Therefore, it is wrong for military workers not to care about political work, and it is wrong for political workers not to care about military work, and both should be completely corrected.
    To sum up, it is necessary to adopt the realistic work method of the mass line, to develop and organize the high degree of initiative and creativity of all commanders and fighters, and to develop the ability and wisdom of all commanders and fighters, in order to overcome all difficulties and complete the tasks of combat, training, uniting officers and soldiers, uniting the military and the people, and disintegrating the enemy army, so as to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. This is the core of political work. In the future, we should better study and familiarize ourselves with this mass line work method, greatly promote this work method, improve the effectiveness of political work, and complete the arduous tasks given to political work in the self-defense war. Only in this way can we completely overcome the formalism and dogmatism in political work that depart from the masses and proceed from subjective wishes. (December 29, 1946)

    发扬和组织全体指战员的积极性和创造性是政治工作的中心
    ——为总结自卫战争以来政治工作写
    张际春
    反对蒋介石卖国独裁的爱国自卫战争，是同人民及其军队全体指战员的利益完全相结合的战争，是人民及其军队全体指战员自己的大事情，人民及其军队全体指战员对于爱国自卫战争是完全拥护的。半年来自卫战争中部队工作的经验完全证明，无论是保证战斗任务练兵任务的完成也好，或者是团结官兵、团结军民、瓦解敌军等任务的完成也好，只要发挥了和组织了全体指战员的积极性和创造性，取得了广大指战员的热烈赞助，就有力量有办法，一切就可以做好，而且做得很好；否则不去或不大注意去发挥和组织全体指战员的积极性和创造性，没有得到广大指战员的热烈赞助，就没有力量，办法就少，一切工作就做得不好，或者做得不大好。因此我们在工作中认识这一环并抓紧这一环是非常必要的。
    关于发挥全体指战员的积极性和创造性完成各方面的任务，这条一般说是大家已经公认了的，但做起来就不那样容易，就有待于我们去深刻研究和学习了。我们在工作中到底怎样去发挥全体指战员的积极性和创造性呢？根据我们已经体会到的，我们首先在指导思想上必须有群众观念，相信广大指战员有智慧、有力量，相信部队各方面的任务有了广大干部和战士积极起来参加就能够完成、少数是不能完成的，而随时随地依靠广大指战员的大多数。
    有了群众观念，才能进一步建立起接近群众、深入群众、随时去了解每个干部和战士情况的作风。战争情况是非常紧张的，变化是非常快非常多的，单只部队成员一项就经常在不断的变化中，至于部队中干部和战士在战争中的思想情感也常常是很不一样的，他们对于时局、对于蒋介石的进攻、对于优良装备的蒋军、对于技术和战术的训练、对于首长的命令、对于新补充来的战士和新解放来的同志、对于他的家乡、对于老百姓、对于敌军官兵等都可以有各种差别的认识和态度，到底那些认识和态度对于党的方针和他们自己的利益相吻合，那些不相吻合呢？都须要去及时加以了解和判明，尤其在经过紧张战斗情况之下，更须要如此，不接近群众、不深入群众、上下隔绝起来是不能及时得到了解的。
    深入群众，及时了解了部队干部战士情况之后，不是追随群众的尾巴，容忍或迁就群众的不正确思想，也不是专靠命令的办法，强迫群众执行（自然军队中执行命令是非常重要的），而是采取及时说服和诱导的办法，使其转变，特别是通过群众中的进步分子的影响，相互教育相互帮助，造成群众性的正义的热潮，造成同为粉碎蒋介石进攻战斗到底的热潮，团结老百姓、坚决执行三大纪律八项注意的热潮，宣传和瓦解敌军官兵，执行俘虏政策的热潮，大家学习和拥护新英雄和模范的热潮，这样来培养和造成部队中生气勃勃的战斗的练兵的和各方面工作的紧张的空气。八九部队王家垓战斗后情绪消沉，他们就是通过自下而上的群众性战斗检讨、和配合着具体的时事教育之后顺利转变的；他们由高潮的学习情绪紧接着转变为饱满的战斗情绪。打整三师整十一师和五军后，各部队指战员都感到克服敌人炮火及工事的重要，于是群众在讨论中研究出很多很好的避免敌人炮火、破坏敌人工事的方法。技术和战术的研究大大的提高了一步，胜利信心和战斗力大大的提高了一步，最近甚至已经经过群众研究出冬季如何挖工事和使用机枪等方法。一个时期不少的干部和老战士感觉到新战士在战斗中是一种累赘，而产生若干厌恶心理，后来经过群众的讨论就转变过来了，大家认为只要耐心帮助新战士，同时教育新战士自己努力学习，新战士一样能很快打仗的，王克勤的模范班就是在这种基础上产生和发现的。
    部队干部和战士的积极性和创造性一经发扬之后，经过群众的智慧和创造能力，必然要创造出团结内部的、互助的、作战的、练兵的、瓦解蒋军的好方法，同时也必然要涌现出无数的杰出的各方面的英雄和模范，这里有群众性的战斗检讨的时事教育与思想教育结合的范例，有模范的、练兵的、巩固部队的、战斗的互助小组，有模范的连长、指导员和大批的排长班长、大批的战斗英雄，有不少的机智的侦察员、射击手、工兵英雄，有积极工作的宣传小组、军事教导工作者和指战员所喜爱的画家，有保卫工作的模范，有不少的模范的医生、护士、卫生长、卫生员及医务工作者，这时领导的责任就在于及时发现和介绍这些好方法、好典型和各种英雄模范，供大家学习，使它普遍起来，把整个工作向前推进一步，这同时也是我们培养干部、解决战争中干部问题主要方法之一，然而这方面我们过去还是做得不够和不普遍的，这仍然还是由于深入群众不够的原因。
    深入群众、了解群众、解决群众中的问题、启发广大指战员的积极性和创造性，造成战斗的、练兵的、各方面工作的群众性的热潮，涌现出各方面工作的英雄和模范，没有党委领导及其下的军事政治机关的一元化的有中心的领导是不能实现的，各级党委会必须依靠它对于当前任务和部队实际情况的了解，及时规定出军事政治工作的重点，动员军事政治机关的力量，协同一致的围绕着一定的中心，密切配合着共同去进行，无论是作战的、宣传的、组织的部门，都像一部有节奏的音乐一样配合起来，党委及军事政治机关不善于集中和分配他的指导力量，不善于发扬和依靠这些力量，一样是不善于依靠群众，结果它的领导意图和思想，也必然不能变为群众的意图和思想。军事政治工作机关自然有它不同的科学的分工，但军事政治工作人员在他们的实际工作中是很难分开的，每一个军事人员当他进行军事工作的时候，必须关心每一个工作中的思想问题，首先集中力量解决群众中的思想问题，因此他就不能不要参加政治工作；尤其各级军事指挥员，当他注意到政治工作首先从思想上去进行他的工作的时候，他的工作任务常常是顺利的更好的完成。政治工作人员也一样，他自然要着重从政治上思想上去启发群众，发扬群众的积极性，但他必须同时关心军事工作、懂得军事工作。发扬指战员的战斗积极性的目的是为了打胜仗，他就不能不要知道如何进行战斗，知道对于当前敌人应采取那种战斗方法，并提倡那种战斗方法，发挥指战员练兵的积极性和创造性；他就不能不要知道如何进行练兵，并广为提倡和介绍练兵中的新的创造和模范，因为战斗方法不好技术不熟练，直接影响到战斗的胜败，同时也影响到指战员的积极性和人民自卫战争政治任务的完成，这也就是大家所说的“勇敢与技术结合”。因此军事工作人员不关心政治工作，政治工作人员不关心军事工作，都是不对的，都应完全纠正。
    概括起来说，就是必须采取群众路线的实事求是的工作方法，去发扬和组织全体指战员高度的积极性和创造性，发挥全体指战员的能力和智慧，以达到克服一切困难完成战斗任务、练兵任务、团结官兵、团结军民、瓦解敌军的任务，以至粉碎蒋介石进攻的任务。这是政治工作的中心，今后我们应当更好的来研究和熟悉这种群众路线的工作方法，大大的提倡这种工作方法，提高政治工作效能，完成自卫战争中给予政治工作的艰巨任务。也只有这样，才能完全克服政治工作中从主观愿望出发的脱离群众的形式主义和教条主义。（一九四六年十二月二十九日）
