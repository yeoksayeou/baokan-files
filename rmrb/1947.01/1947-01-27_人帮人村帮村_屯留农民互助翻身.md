    People Help People, Village Helps Village
    Tunliu Peasants Help Each Other Overturn Their Situation
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 25th] Under the slogan of "One person overturns their situation, everyone overturns their situation. One village overturns their situation, every village overturns their situation," the filling-the-gaps and making-even movement in Tunliu, in addition to continuing to cut off the feudal remnants, has universally launched a mutual assistance movement for peasants to overturn their situation, with people helping people and villages helping villages. In the celebration of the great overturning in Dongxingwang, it was discovered that two households had not cut off their feudal remnants, and eighteen peasant households did not have enough land to cultivate. Therefore, after the meeting, they re-struggled against Li Taiping and Zhang Xiaoqin, taking out 17 mu of land, 15 shi of grain, and 114 pieces of farm tools. This fruit, with the unanimous agreement of the village's peasants, was distributed to the more than ten peasant households lacking land. Now every household in the village has an average of more than five mu of land. In addition, the remaining 27 shi of millet from the village after filling the gaps were all given to the peasants of Nan Yuzhe. When the masses of Gancaotan heard that the poor peasants of Dongcun and Huidu villages had not completely overturned their situations, they helped Huidu with 15 shi of miscellaneous grains and Dongcun with 10 shi, saying happily, "All the peasants under heaven are one family, and they should all have land to cultivate and food to eat." Finally, it was decided that the village would personally deliver the grain to them. The next day, all the villagers automatically took their pockets, with men carrying three dou, women carrying two dou, and children carrying one dou, and delivered it to Huidu. Chencun was relatively wealthy and took out 40 shi of millet to help Boisheng, enabling them to also achieve every household overturning their situation and filling the gaps. Therefore, the peasants who overturned their situation all said very happily, "Isn't this thanks to Chairman Mao's great fortune!"

    屯留农民互助翻身
    【本报太岳二十五日电】屯留填平补齐运动在“一人翻身，大家翻身。一村翻身，村村翻身。”的口号下，各村群众除继续割封建尾巴外，普遍展开了人帮人、村帮村的翻身互助运动。东兴旺在庆祝大翻身会中，又发现两户封建尾巴没割掉，十八户农民地不够种，于是会后就对李太平、张小亲重新斗争，拿出土地十七亩，粮食十五石，农具一百一十四件。这果实经全村农民一致同意分给缺地的十多户农民，现全村每户都平均到五亩地以上。另外又将本村除填补外所余的二十七石小米，全部让给南渔泽农民。甘草滩群众听到东村、灰都村贫苦群众没翻透身，帮助灰都杂粮十五石，东村十石并高兴的说：“天下农民是一家，都应该有地种有饭吃”。最后决定本村亲自把粮给他们送去，第二天全村群众都自动的拿着口袋，男人背三斗，妇女背二斗，小孩背一斗，送到灰都。陈村比较富足，拿出小米四十石帮助了柏盛，使他们也都做到家家翻身，填平了窟窿，因此翻身农民都非常高兴的说：“这还不是靠了毛主席的鸿福！”
