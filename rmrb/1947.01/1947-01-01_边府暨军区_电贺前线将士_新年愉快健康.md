    Send New Year Greetings to Frontline Soldiers
    Happy New Year and Good Health
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Border Region Government, Military Region Headquarters, and Political Department have sent a telegram to the soldiers on the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area to wish them a Happy New Year. The original telegram is as follows:
    Comrades, all commanders and fighters on the front lines:
    You have persisted in fighting on the front lines, overcoming all difficulties, and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, giving Chiang Kai-shek's offensive a severe blow. You have annihilated thirteen brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's forces and defended our liberated areas. The people and staff throughout our liberated areas are delighted, encouraged, and applaud your heroic fighting spirit and great achievements. We all feel an unparalleled sense of glory! The new year of 1947 brings even more intense combat missions. You have put forward the slogan of winning a few more victories to welcome the New Year. We will do everything in our power to support you and cooperate with you to complete even more and greater heroic feats! Let us, the entire liberated area, celebrate the New Year with cheers of unprecedented and great victory! We take this opportunity of the New Year's arrival to extend our deep condolences and New Year greetings to you! Under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong, we must unite more closely, further promote the spirit of hard struggle, be prudent and humble, guard against arrogance and rashness, further improve our military technology and political work, further strengthen the relationship between the army and the people, and ensure that we win every battle and become stronger as we fight, thoroughly completing the great combat tasks given to us in 1947.
    Wishing you a Happy New Year!
    Good Health!
    Government of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region
