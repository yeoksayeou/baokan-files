An international event worthy of attention this week is Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union and Marshall's replacement of Byrnes as the US Secretary of State.

Montgomery flew to Moscow twenty days earlier than expected from London. This was exactly when London was in an uproar over rumors of an impending military cooperation agreement between Britain and the United States, causing great indignation among the British people. Newspaper headlines screamed: "Shameful! Disgraceful!" Labour opposition members vehemently shouted: "Please let the government immediately announce the truth!" While Attlee and Morrison were urgently defending themselves in the House of Commons, it was also the time when Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations were stalled, and London merchants, who valued exports as their lifeblood, eagerly awaited orders from Moscow. Simultaneously, the Labour government was dealing with the disturbances in Palestine caused by Jewish people equipped with American-style flamethrowers, while many American organizations were still raising funds to buy them weapons to oppose Britain. As the Chief of Staff of the British Empire, and also the person who, according to rumors, had discussed military cooperation with the US side during his visit to Washington last September, Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union at this time would naturally give different impressions to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Regarding Montgomery's trip, it can at least be pointed out that it is an important sign of the development of the relationship between the three powers after the war. It shows that the situation where Bevin and Byrnes followed each other closely at the London UN General Assembly last year is about to undergo major changes. The envoy of 10 Downing Street visits both the White House and the Kremlin. Looking ahead, it can be predicted that events like the one on the 8th of this month, when the Soviet delegate Derevyanko, on the Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo, supported and questioned Acheson, will gradually become more common.

Simultaneous with Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union, Marshall replaced Byrnes. Byrnes was the executor of the crude "tough policy towards the Soviet Union." He was both criticized by domestic public opinion and met with setbacks in the two major conferences in New York. Now, he has resigned under the pretext of "physical exhaustion." His successor, Marshall, is one of the few five-star generals in the United States, neither a Democrat nor a Republican, and also served as a special envoy to China for a year. At a time when generals have become political celebrities and the Democratic government and the Republican Congress are at odds in the United States, and when the Far East issue is gradually becoming the focus of world attention, Marshall's succession to Byrnes is naturally attracting attention from all parties. According to American newspapers, American policy is unlikely to change course due to the change of Secretary of State. Then, it can be affirmed that the difficulties facing Marshall will be even greater than those encountered by Byrnes.

　　三强关系变化的重要标志
    这一周内动人听闻的国际大事是蒙哥马利访苏和马歇尔接替贝纳斯任美国务卿。
    蒙哥马利比预期早二十天就从伦敦飞到了莫斯科，这正是伦敦为关于英美将签订军事合作协定的传说闹得乱哄哄，英国人民大为愤激，报纸标题：“可耻啊！丢脸啊！”工党反对派议员们奋臂高呼：“请政府马上宣布真相！”急待艾德礼、摩里逊在下院连声辩解之时，也正是英苏贸易谈判停滞不前，视输出如性命的伦敦商人急盼来自莫斯科的定货单之时，同时也正是工党政府为配有美式火焰投掷器的犹太人在巴勒斯坦大闹骚动，而美国不少团体尚正募款给他们购买武器以反对英国之时；作为英帝国的参谋总长，而且又是传说中，在其去年九月访华府时，曾与美方商谈军事合作的蒙哥马利，正于此时访苏，自然会予英国国内、美国、苏联以不同的印象。关于蒙氏此行，现在至少可以指出是战后三强关系发展的重要标志。他显示像去年今日伦敦联合国大会上贝文与贝纳斯亦步亦趋的形势将有重大的变化，唐宁街十号的使者，访问白宫也访问克里姆林宫，瞻望未来，可以预料，像本月八日东京盟国对日委员会不波尔支持德勒维扬科而质问艾其森的事件将逐渐普遍化起来。
    正与蒙哥马利访苏同时，马歇尔接替了贝纳斯，贝纳斯是粗暴的“对苏强硬政策”的执行人，他既为国内舆论所责难，又在纽约两大会议中碰了壁，现在以“体力不继”为辞而告退了。继任的马歇尔是美国屈指可数的几位五星上将之一，既非民主党人，又非共和党人，而并出任驻华特使有一年之久，在将领们成了政治红人和民主党政府与共和党国会的今日之美国，在远东问题逐渐成为举世瞩目之中心的现在，马歇尔又接替贝纳斯，自然为各方所重视。据美国报纸意见，美国策不致因国务卿易人而改辕易辙，那末可以肯定，摆在马歇尔面前的困难，将更甚于贝纳斯所遇到的困难。
