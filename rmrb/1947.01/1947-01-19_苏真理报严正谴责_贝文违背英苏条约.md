　　[This dispatch is from] TASS, Moscow, 15th: *Pravda* published an article entitled "Bevin Denies the Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty," stating: Recently, the foreign policy of the British Labour government has been severely criticized. This criticism represents people from all strata, including non-partisan intellectuals, Labour Party members of parliament, and expanded trade union members. Noteworthy among the criticisms is the speech made by Labour MP Zilliacus at the Labour Student League conference. Zilliacus commented on British foreign policy towards the Soviet Union, stating: The Labour government has fallen into the political line advocated by Churchill. Voters voted for the Labour Party, but Bevin's foreign policy lacks the characteristics that its voters want to see, namely a firm line of cooperation and friendship not only with the United States but also with the Soviet Union. After the Labour government came to power, it did not improve Anglo-Soviet relations and further develop friendship between the two countries. The British people have obviously been aroused to doubt and worry about this. In his Christmas speech on December 22, Bevin wanted to redeem the people's condemnation of his policies. He said: "Some say that my policy is too closely aligned with the United States, and that relations with the Soviet Union are not as close as they should be." He also said: "Great Britain is not bound by anything other than the obligations of the United Nations Charter." Bevin's statement cannot but cause surprise, namely, what attitude does Bevin take towards Britain's international obligations? Has Bevin forgotten that Britain is bound to the Soviet Union by the Anglo-Soviet Treaty? That treaty is the "Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Militarist Germany and its European Accomplices and of Post-War Collaboration and Mutual Assistance." Though does Bevin forget that the treaty was signed in London on May 26, 1942, and is for a period of twenty years? Recently, Bevin proposed to the Soviet government to extend the treaty from twenty years to fifty years, and Bevin's statement that Britain is "not bound by anything" is also a fact. Then, we can now see the true value of Bevin's proposal to extend the Anglo-Soviet treaty. This proposal does not represent a genuine desire to improve relations with the Soviet Union. Bevin's words are not always in line with the real facts of British foreign policy. His statement is tantamount to denying the Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty.

　　苏真理报严正谴责  贝文违背英苏条约
    【本报讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：真理报以“贝文否认英苏互助条约”为题，著论称：近来英工党政府外交政策受到严重批评，此种批评代表无党派的知识分子、工党议员及扩大职工联盟会员等各阶层人民。批评中可注意者，为工党议员希利亚喀斯于劳工学生联盟会议上所发表之演说，希氏评论英对苏外交政策称：工党政府已陷入了邱吉尔所主张之政治路线，选民曾投票选举工党，而贝文外交政策正缺少其选民所愿看到的特色，即不仅对美国而且对苏联合作友好的坚定路线。工党政府执政后，并未增进英苏关系和进一步发展两国间之友谊，英国人民显然已为此种事激起疑惑与忧虑。在十二月廿二日所发表的圣诞节演说中，贝文想挽回人民对其政策的谴责，彼称：“有人谓余之政策与美国结合过于紧密，而与苏联关系则不如应有之密切。”彼又称：“大不列颠除联合国宪章之义务外，不受任何约束”。贝文此一声明，不能不引起惊异，即贝文对英国之国际义务，究取何种态度。难道贝文已忘记英国对苏联是受英苏联条约的约束吗？该约即“战时抗击军国主义德国及其欧洲同谋者，和战后合作互助条约”。虽道贝文忘记了该约是于一九四二年五月二十六日在伦敦所签订而且为期二十年吗？最近贝文向苏联政府提议把该约由二十年延长到五十年，而贝文声明不列颠“不受任何约束”亦是事实，那么，现在我们可以看出贝文延长英苏条约期限之提议的真实价值了，这个提议并不表示增进对苏关系的真实愿望，贝文之言论不是经常与英国外交政策之真实事实符合的，其声明无异否认了英苏互助条约。
