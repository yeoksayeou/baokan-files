    Comrade Teng Daiyuan Saves His Full Year's Entitlement of Clothing
    Military Region Launches a Production and Savings Campaign
    Forgo Full Year's Office Miscellaneous Expenses, Each Person Produces and Turns in 10,000 Yuan to the Public

    [This Newspaper's Report] Comrade Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, sent a letter to the Military Region Headquarters Branch Committee on January 11th, calling on all comrades in the department to launch a production and savings campaign. It stated in brief: "At this time when the patriotic self-defense war is becoming more arduous and nearing victory, under the goal of doing everything to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, it is required that all comrades in the Headquarters deeply recognize the important significance of production and savings. It is hoped that the branch will initiate discussions among the groups, and quickly formulate this year's production and savings plan, to serve as a model for our entire army." Comrade Teng Daiyuan also set an example by voluntarily saving his full year's entitlement of clothing for public use: one military cap, two sets of single military uniforms, two pairs of socks, six pairs of shoes and leggings, cotton clothing, cotton caps, etc. In response to the call from higher authorities, the department has formulated the following production and savings measures for this year: 1. Forgo the full year's office miscellaneous expenses, to be resolved through production by the units themselves. 2. Each section chief voluntarily proposed to cancel the middle kitchen. 3. All personnel will eat collectively, saving 18,000 jin of millet throughout the year. 4. The management section will organize weaving factories, flour mills, tofu shops, iron, wood, handicrafts, and transportation industries (all of which have started operations) to solve the required expenses for the whole year. 5. On an individual level, after discussion, in addition to each person producing and turning in 10,000 yuan to the public, the rest will be determined by their own savings plan. If an individual's production and surrender to the public exceeds 10,000 yuan, the remainder will be their own. Production methods: agriculture and handicrafts are the main focus, and no one is allowed to engage in business.
