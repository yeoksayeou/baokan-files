[Report from this newspaper in Weixian, 17th] The districts of Wuxun are conducting in-depth inspections to promptly resolve pending cases in the villages and correct the phenomenon of detachment from the masses. According to the County Committee's renewed instructions to thoroughly resolve pending village cases, rationally and quickly distribute the fruits of struggle, and strive to complete land reform thoroughly before spring plowing, village cadres of Dazhifangtou Village in the Fifth District of Wuxun, based on the masses' urgent demand for distributing the fruits of struggle, held successive village cadre meetings and group meetings to reach a common understanding. All the fruits of their struggle (75 mu of land and 500,000 yuan) were rationally distributed according to social class, thoroughly eliminating the poor peasants, which greatly excited the masses. Following this, a great self-reflection of emancipated peasants was conducted, actively completing war service tasks. Li Yingyu, representative director of Zhangtun Sub-district in the First District, after self-reflection and examination, deeply understood that his rigid work style had caused great losses in his work. He expressed that in the future, he must consult with everyone before doing anything, and requested members to offer more opinions and criticisms, establishing a regular reporting system. Qian Wangzhuang in the Second District, after inspection and self-reflection, the masses of the entire village, through group discussions, decided to give 25 mu of land to Hou Wangzhuang. Datanzhuang in the Sixth District, through group meetings to reach a common understanding among members, decided to give a portion of the floating assets to the middle peasants, which greatly satisfied the middle peasants of the entire village. Many middle peasants joined the peasant association. Since receiving the instructions from the County Committee in the Eighth District, all district cadres first conducted inspections of the leadership. Everyone unanimously believed that the pending issues in each village must be handled in a thorough and meticulous manner. The sub-district leadership forming factions, failing to study together, and individual village representatives being detached from the masses and selfish should all be quickly corrected.
