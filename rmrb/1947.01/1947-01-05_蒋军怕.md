　　Jiang's Troops are Afraid
　　Hand grenades, not so big,
　　Often blossom in Jiang's troops' nests;
　　The Eighth Route Army uses them to attack and defend,
　　Jiang's troops are most afraid when they see them.
　　Hand grenades, emitting black smoke,
　　Jiang's troops turn back when they see them,
　　Dropping American guns and cannons,
　　Fleeing with heads in hands, urging "Hurry up!"
　　Hand grenades, truly effective,
　　Beating Jiang's troops until they call us "father,"
　　Groups of Jiang's troops are scared away,
　　Reporting to officers, "It's terrible!"

　　蒋军怕
    手榴弹，不算大，
    蒋军窝里常开花；
    八路军用它攻和守，
    蒋军见了最害怕。
    手榴弹，冒黑烟，
    蒋军见了往回颠，
    摔下美国枪和炮，
    抱头鼠窜催“快点”。
    手榴弹，真算话，
    打得蒋军叫爸爸，
    成群蒋军被吓跑，
    报告官长“不得了！”
