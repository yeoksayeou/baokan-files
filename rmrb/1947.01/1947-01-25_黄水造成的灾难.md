　　The Disaster Caused by the Yellow River Flooding
    Li Yi
    A few days ago, this reporter accompanied Director Wang of the Yellow River Commission on an inspection of the Yellow River water head. As the car drove to the areas affected by the flooding, the banks were lined with residents from along the river, countless angry eyes staring fixedly at the flowing water, countless resolute mouths loudly cursing Chiang Kai-shek: "Old Chiang, you son of a bitch, you've really made us suffer! We will settle this score with you!" The muddy yellow water rolled eastward, the waves lapping at the sand on the banks, occasionally eroding clumps of soil. Some residents were frantically cutting the reeds they used to grow in the riverbed, some of which had already been washed down; they hurriedly went to retrieve them. The north wind blew, causing those standing in the cold Yellow River water to chatter their teeth, and the women on the shore called out incessantly with trembling voices: "Don't bother retrieving them, go back and pack up! In a little while, we won't be able to move the grain!" Li Binghui, a peasant from Xinzhuang, said to the reporter: "I fled famine to Manchuria and worked for more than ten years, almost starving to death. A few years ago, I came back and settled down, cultivating more than twenty mu of land in the riverbed, which was enough for my family of four. Now the water is here, and I have to flee famine again! Chiang Kai-shek, you devil!" I asked him: "Have you prepared any boats?" "Look," he pointed to a pile of rotten planks and said, "The enemy has ravaged us for several years, our village doesn't even have a good plank, let alone a boat." We walked westward along the riverbank, and encountered a continuous stream of refugees. The new village in the riverbed had been submerged, the willow branches swaying with the waves, and most of the houses were no longer visible. The shouts, cries, and curses of the people rushing to transport their belongings were mixed together. An old man named He, who had fled from Fan County with his family of four, was carrying a small amount of grain and bedding that they had managed to salvage towards the district office. He said that their village had no boats, and they only knew that the water was coming when it reached their doorstep; they couldn't move their belongings, and their houses were washed away. We asked him where he planned to move to. His wife replied: "We have no money or food, where can we move? Old He said to go to the district chief and ask him to give us some grain." Old He sighed and shook his head, saying: "Old Chiang said that he would arrange for us to move before releasing the water, who knew that this guy was a beast in human form!" I asked him about the situation of the people behind them. He told us that the democratic government was stepping up its efforts to provide relief, and some of the victims had already been resettled. When our car drove back, it was already dark, and the people of Zhangqiu were waiting on the cold and desolate riverbank, asking for news. Director Wang told them that the water would be flowing to their area soon. People immediately panicked and hurriedly packed their belongings. When the people of Shiqiao and Taochengpu in Zhangqiu heard this news, they were almost driven mad, because there was an eight-zhang wide ditch between Shiqiao and Taochengpu, and they had been unable to start construction in the past due to lack of money and materials. Once the water reached here, the people of Zhangqiu County would all be submerged. The people immediately beat gongs, lit lanterns, and rushed to repair the river embankment, carrying all the wooden doors and planks from their homes to block the gaps. Young people were in a frenzy, and the women cursed Chiang Kai-shek like mad, repeatedly stating: "Old Chiang, you are deliberately trying to kill us, we will settle this score with you!"

　　黄水造成的灾难
    力以
    日前，记者随黄委会王主任视察黄河水头。汽车开到水头所到的地方，堤岸上站满着沿岸的居民，无数只愤怒的眼睛死盯着流水，无数张坚毅的嘴吧大声的咒骂蒋介石：“老蒋，好小子，你算是把咱们害苦了，这笔帐总要和你算清的。”混黄色的流水向东方滚滚流去，波浪敲打着岸边的沙土，不时冲溃岸边的土块。有些居民正在河床抢割往日栽种的芦苇，一些芦苇已被冲倒了，他们仓皇地赶去打捞。北风吹得站在冰冷的黄水里的人们个个抖着牙根，娘儿们在岸边带着打抖的声音不停的呼叫着：“别捞啦，回去收拾收拾吧，一会儿粮食就搬不走了！”新庄一个老百姓叫李炳辉，他对记者说：“我逃荒到关外扛了十几年活，差点儿饿死，前几年回来安了家业，在河床搞了二十多亩地，四口人满够过的。现在水过来了，又得逃荒去！蒋介石你个天杀的。”我问他：“你们准备船只没有”？“你瞧，”他指给我看一堆腐烂了的船板说：“敌人糟害了好几年，俺村里别说船，连一块好的船板也没有了”。我们沿岸向西走去，沿路灾民络绎不绝，河床新村已被淹没，柳梢随着水波摇摆，房屋多半已看不见了，老百姓抢运财物的呼喊哭叫和咒骂声混成一团。一个从范县逃出来的何老汉，一家四口，挑着抢运出来的一点粮食和被褥往区部里去，他说俺庄没有船，水来到门口咱们才知道，东西没有搬出来，房子就被冲垮了。我们问他打算搬到那里去。他老婆接着说：“没钱没粮往那里搬呀，咱老何说找区长去，请区长给发些粮食”。老何叹了一口气摇着头说：“老蒋说过，先安排咱们搬家才放水，谁知道这小子人面兽心呢！”我问起他们后面老百姓的情形，他告诉我们，民主政府正在加紧设法救济，有的灾民已经安置好了。当我们的汽车开回去时，已经是黑夜了，张秋的老百姓都等在冷风凄凄的河堤上打听消息。王主任告诉他们，再有多久水就要流到他们这个地方，人们立刻就都慌忙的收拾东西去了。张秋石桥陶城铺的老百姓听到这个消息，简直急疯了，因为石桥与陶城铺之间有八丈宽的沟，过去因为没钱没材料不能动工，一旦水到这里，张秋县的人就会全被淹没。老百姓们当即敲锣点灯赶修河堤，把家里所有的木板门板都搬出来堵塞缺口。青年人在暴跳，娘儿们发疯似的诅咒蒋介石，他们重复的申诉着：“老蒋，你安心害死咱们，这笔账总要和你算清的！”
