The masses in the First District of Yicheng gnash their teeth at the mention of the KMT soldier "Captain Zhu." Whenever these beasts arrive at a village, they ransack chests and cabinets, grabbing people and seizing anything they can get their hands on.

Militiaman Zhang Baozhi vowed to eliminate this "Captain Zhu" and avenge the people. During battle, he discovered "Captain Zhu's" patterns: he walks in the middle of the column during marches, and he walks ahead when entering a village, grabbing whatever he sees first.

Once, Comrade Zhang Baozhi laid a landmine at the western sentry post of × village and blocked the road with thorny bushes, waiting specifically for "Captain Zhu" to come and get a taste. However, "Captain Zhu" didn't come that day. Zhang Baozhi then told the militiamen to fire a few shots near the pillbox. Sure enough, the enemy followed the command, with "Captain Zhu" leading more than sixty soldiers in a grand procession. Upon reaching the edge of the village, "Captain Zhu," as usual, showed off his prowess, leading two soldiers to walk ahead onto the high ground west of the village. He reached out to clear the thorny bushes blocking the road, but before he could retract his hand, "Boom!" "Captain Zhu's" hand was blown off, his nose disappeared, and a nipple opened a path from behind his spine. One soldier lay screaming in a pool of blood. Another soldier, dazed by the blast, picked up two landmines, not knowing what they were, and threw them with all his might. With a loud bang, several soldiers nearby fell. "Captain Zhu's" lackeys were thrown into chaos, and they carried "Captain Zhu's" mangled and bloated body, turning and running.

When Zhang Baozhi entered the village, an old man excitedly told him: "Old Zhang, you really did a number on 'Captain Zhu!'" Comrade Zhang Baozhi replied: "That mine was specifically for 'Captain Zhu'."

    专揍“朱队长”的雷
    翼城民兵英雄故事
    翼城一区群众，一提起蒋军的“朱队长”，人人切齿，这伙畜生每到一村，不是翻箱就是倒柜，见人就抓，见东西就抢。
    民兵张保智发誓要干掉这个“朱队长”，为大伙报仇。在战斗中，摸住“朱队长”的活动规律——行军走在队伍中间，进村走在前面，见东西他先要。
    有一次，张保智同志在×村西哨位上埋地雷，并用圪针拦住路，专等“朱队长”来吃家伙，可是这天“朱队长”没有来，张保智就叫民民去碉堡附近打两枪，敌人果然听指挥，由“朱队长”带着六十多个小兵浩浩荡荡的来了。到了村边，“朱队长”照例的逞能，带着两个小兵先走上村西高地上，用手拉开拦路的圪针，他还没有缩回手，“轰”的一声，“朱队长”的手被炸掉了，鼻子也不见，一个奶头从脊背后开路了，一个士兵躺在血泊里叫唤。另外一个兵被炸的神志昏述之后，拾起两颗地雷，不知是啥，用力一扔，轰隆一声，左近几个兵随声倒下，“朱队长”的喽罗们顿时大乱，抬着“朱队长”被炸后残缺不全肥大的躯体，扭头就跑。
    当张保智进村的时候，一个老汉兴奋的跟他说：“老张，可把‘朱队长’炸坏了，”张保智同志说：“那个雷就是专揍‘朱队长’的。”
