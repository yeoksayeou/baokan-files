    Lüliang Our Army Achieves Another Victory
    Annihilating Over 2,000 Chiang Troops
    Capturing Chen Chengwu, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 617th Brigade
    Southern Suiyuan: We Recapture Qingshuihe County Seat
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Front, 5th] Our Lüliang Eighth Route Army, at 6 PM on December 30th, annihilated two battalions (minus) of the Chiang army's 617th Brigade in Zhikuang @ Zhi Jingyan, Pu County. According to preliminary statistics, the results of the battle were: over 500 enemy troops killed including Regiment Commander Yao Changtai, and 1,700 enemy troops captured alive, including Chen Chengwu, Deputy Brigade Commander, and Wang Shumin, Chief of Staff. Brigade Commander Li Hehui escaped with only a few guards. We seized three mountain guns, two anti-tank guns, seven mortars, over a hundred light and heavy machine guns, eight hundred rifles, over two hundred artillery shells, and many other military supplies.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Front, 6th] The Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army, in coordination with local armed forces, swiftly recovered Qingshuihe County in southern Suiyuan on the 3rd, wiping out all the puppet troops of Fu Zuoyi who had occupied the city for many days. The city was originally liberated from the Japanese invaders by the Eighth Route Army through bloody battles. After being occupied by Fu Zuoyi's forces in January last year, it was frequently harassed, and the people suffered from heavy taxes, levies, and forced conscription. In order to defend themselves and protect the interests of the people, the Eighth Route Army launched a swift attack on the city at 2 AM on the 3rd. The battle ended at 8 AM. The results of the battle are currently being tallied.

    【新华社晋绥五日电】我吕梁八路军于十二月三十日下午六时，在蒲县纸圹＠之井砚歼灭蒋军六一七旅缺两个营，战果据初步统计：击毙二百团团长姚常泰以下五百余人，生俘该旅副旅长陈诚武及参谋长王树民以下一千七百余人，旅长李和侩仅带数名卫兵而逃。我缴获山炮三门，战防炮两门，迫击炮七门，轻重机枪百余挺，步枪八百支，炮弹二百余发，及其他军用品甚多。
    【新华社晋绥六日电】晋绥八路军配合地方武装于三日一举光复绥远南部之清水河县城，侵占该城多日之傅伪军全部就歼。该城原为八路军经血战从日寇手中所解放。去年一月间被傅作义部侵占后，时常出扰，人民遭受苛征暴敛强抓壮丁之苦。八路军为自卫与保护人民利益，乃于三日二时，以神速动作，一举袭入该城，激战至八时，战斗即告结束，战果正在清查中。
