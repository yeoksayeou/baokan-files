Regarding the Yoshida Cabinet

Yoshida Shigeru is a well-known, steady, militaristic element of Japan, a politician nurtured by the Mitsui zaibatsu for many years. On May 16th of last year, under national anger, the Japanese Emperor was forced to remove the Shidehara Cabinet and replace it with Yoshida to continue his rule, which served American imperialists and opposed the Japanese people.

The Yoshida Cabinet was officially formed on May 25th and was a cabinet composed entirely of Japanese financial magnates and militarists. As a result, during Yoshida's seven months in power, he implemented the so-called "food policy," on the one hand forcing the people to hand over more food, causing them to starve, and on the other hand using "starvation" to beg the United States for relief and to obtain permission to revive industrial consumption. He passed the reactionary constitution drafted by Shidehara and approved by the Supreme Commander MacArthur, formulated the "Anti-Strike Bill" and the "Labor Relations Arbitration Bill," expanded the police force, forced students to undergo military training, opposed the Soviet Union and China, arbitrarily massacred overseas Chinese, and created the Shibuya bloodbath.

Precisely because of Yoshida's extreme reactionary rule, the Japanese democratic movement surged during these seven months. On May 17th of last year, 250,000 people in Tokyo held a rice rally in front of the Japanese Imperial Palace, followed by a strike movement of 100,000 sailors, the anti-Yoshida movement in October, and the 400,000-strong demonstration to overthrow the cabinet in mid-December.

　　关于吉田内阁
    吉田茂是日本有名的稳健派军国主义分子、三井财阀豢养多年的政客。去年五月十六日，日皇在全国愤怒下，被迫撤去了币原内阁的班子，而以吉田来继续其承奉美帝国主义者及反日本人民的统治。
    吉田内阁在五月二十五日正式组成，是清一色的日本金融财阀军国主义的内阁。因此吉田统治的七个月内，实行了所谓“粮食政策”，一方面强迫人民缴出更多的粮食，使陷于饥饿；另一方面又用“饥饿”来向美国骗取救济及换得准许食用工业的复兴。通过了由币原起草，经太上皇麦克阿瑟批准的反动宪法，制定了《反罢工法案》，《劳工关系仲裁法案》，扩充警察、强迫学生军训，反苏反华，任意屠杀华侨制造涩谷血案。
    也正因为吉田的极端反动统治，日本民主运动在这七个月内澎湃高涨，去年五月十七日，东京二十五万人在日本皇宫门前举行要米大会，接着有十万海员的罢工运动，十月的倒吉田运动，和十二月中旬的四十万倒阁大示威。
