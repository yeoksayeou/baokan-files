    Singing Old Operas, Avoid Waste
    Comrade Editor:
    Recently, singing old operas has become popular in many villages in Shahe. For example, Zuo Village established a theater troupe, spending two to three hundred thousand yuan just to buy old opera costumes and props. In another instance, village cadres in Baita Village wrote an old opera, spending fifty to sixty thousand yuan. Such extensive singing of old operas not only promotes feudal culture but is also an unnecessary waste. The Shahe County government has issued a public notice to prohibit it. I think the New Year is coming, and people and organizations in various places will want to engage in entertainment. Therefore, I raise this issue, hoping that everyone will study it together to prevent improper entertainment and unnecessary waste.
          Reader, Lu Ke

    The issue raised by Comrade Lu Ke is indeed worthy of everyone's attention. This year, because the peasants in our district have been liberated and the self-defense war has achieved great victories, the masses are all joyous and demand entertainment, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, in engaging in entertainment, we must indeed pay attention. Old operas can be sung, but the content of the old operas should preferably not be things that promote feudal toxins or praise the feudal order. We suggest that the departments responsible for propaganda and education in various places should: first, examine and approve some better old operas for performance in various places; second, carry out some work to transform old operas, compile and print some short drama and Yangko opera scripts for use in various places; third, pay attention to supporting rural theater troupes, strengthen their leadership, and promote self-composition, self-singing, and self-entertainment. At the same time, attention should be paid to thrift in entertainment. It is best not to buy opera costumes and props or hire opera troupes; everything should be resolved within the village. It is said that many villages are taking their struggle gains and spending them lavishly, which is not good. We hope that everyone will put forward more specific suggestions for improvement on this issue.

### 唱旧戏、莫浪费

    唱旧戏、莫浪费
    编辑同志：
    近来沙河不少村庄，风行唱旧戏，像左村就成立了一个剧团，买旧戏箱就花了二三十万元；又如白塔村村干部，写了一台旧戏，花了五六万元。这样大唱旧戏，不仅宣传了封建文化，而且是一种不必要的浪费，沙河县政府已出了布告，予以禁止。我想新年到了，各地群众及机关，都要搞娱乐，所以提出这一问题，希望大家来共同研究，以防止不正当的娱乐及不必要的浪费。

    鲁克同志提出的这个问题，确实值得大家很好的注意。今年由于我区农民翻了身，自卫战争获得了很大胜利，群众都喜气洋洋，要求搞娱乐，这是很可喜的现象。但在搞娱乐中，也确实要注意，旧戏是可以唱的，而唱的旧戏的内容，最好不要是宣传封建毒素、颂扬封建秩序的东西，我们建议各地负宣教责任的工作部门，一要审定一些较好的旧戏在各地演；二是进行些改造旧戏的工作，编印一些短剧秧歌剧本，供各地采用；三是注意扶植农村剧团，加强对它的领导，提倡自编、自唱、自乐。同时在娱乐中，要注意节约，最好不要买戏箱，请戏班，一切自己村中解决。听说有不少村拿着斗争果实，大花大用，都是不好的。对于这个问题，还希望大家多提出些具体改进意见来。
