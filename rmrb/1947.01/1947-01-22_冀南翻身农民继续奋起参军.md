【Report from Weixian on the 20th】Jinnan's emancipated peasants continue to flock to the Self-Defense Army camps. In the land reform movement, the peasants of Dongwangdong Township, Ningnan, recovered more than 1,700 mu of land, as well as many houses and movable property, from the landlords. The peasants said: "Chairman Mao has given us a good life, and we can't let Chiang Kai-shek take it away. We will fight him to the death." The whole town immediately launched a movement to join the army to protect the land. In five days, 209 young men volunteered to sign up and flood into the army camp. Tian Gongyue, chairman of the farmers' association, instructor Tian Chongshan, Wu Weihui Director Tian Fengji, and Self-Defense Captain Jia Qichang all took the lead. Sixty-year-old Mrs. Lu cooked a meal and sent her only son, Li Wugui, off, saying, "Go fight Chiang Kai-shek. Don't worry about the family affairs, even though I'm old, I can still collect firewood and grind flour." At the same time, 96 young men from Nan Town also went to the front line.

　　冀南翻身农民继续奋起参军
    【本报威县二十日电】冀南翻身农民继续涌入自卫军营。宁南东汪东镇农民在翻身运动中，从地主手中算回一千七百余亩土地，和许多房子与浮财，农民们说：“毛主席给咱治下的好时光，咱可不能让老蒋给夺去，死也得和他拚到底。”全镇立时掀起参军保田运动，五天中二百零九名青壮年自动报名涌入军营。农会主席田工岳、指导员田崇山、武委会主任田凤吉、自卫队长贾其昌等都起了带头作用。六十岁的路老太太，做好饭给他独生子李五贵送行，她说：“你去打老蒋吧，别看我年纪老，也能拾柴推碾，家里事不用你担心。”南镇也同时有九十六名青壮年走上前线。
