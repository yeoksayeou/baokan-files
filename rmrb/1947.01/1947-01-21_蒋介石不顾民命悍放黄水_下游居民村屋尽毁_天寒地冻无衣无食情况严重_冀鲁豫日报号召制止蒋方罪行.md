　　[Dispatch from this newspaper's Ji Lu Yu office on the 19th] Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding the lives of the people, recklessly released the Yellow River water to flood the liberated areas to the east. The flood front has now passed Shou Zhang, and wherever the water flows, it is a vast expanse of water. Residents along the river fled in panic. In the freezing cold, they have no clothes, no food, and no homes to return to. The situation is extremely tragic. The *Ji Lu Yu Daily* published an editorial strongly protesting Chiang Kai-shek's crimes and calling on all people in North China and throughout the world to pay attention to Chiang's shameless and malicious conspiracy. The editorial stated: Chiang Kai-shek's malicious conspiracy to use the Yellow River to return to its old course, flooding our area and the entire North China, is about to cause a major disaster after a year of deception. The disaster will inflict damage on the people, its scope will be broad and its impact profound, unprecedented in history. Since the issue of returning to the old course was raised, we have only requested that the Kuomintang repair the river embankments in the old course, rectify dangerous sections, straighten bends, and relocate residents from the riverbed before the Yellow River returns to its old course, to avoid creating new floods. This most reasonable and minimal requirement was stipulated in several agreements signed with the Kuomintang, such as the Heze Agreement, which stipulated that embankments should be repaired before the breach was closed, and the Kaifeng and Nanjing Agreements, which stipulated that breach closure and embankment repair should proceed simultaneously, but the breach closure should not cause flooding in the middle and lower reaches, and that embankment repair should not be affected by any military or political factors. The Shanghai Agreement stipulated specific figures for the restoration of embankment construction grain, construction funds, and relocation and relief funds for riverbed residents. However, the Kuomintang, with the support of American imperialists, is carrying out a huge political and military conspiracy, so all the agreements we signed with the Kuomintang have been broken and torn up by the Kuomintang. To cite the major ones: First, of the construction funds already paid for embankment repair, we advanced US$490,000, but the Kuomintang has not yet reimbursed us, and the Kuomintang has not paid a penny for the urgently needed construction funds, causing our unfinished embankment and other projects to be suspended due to lack of grain and funds. Second, from March to July last year, the Kuomintang wantonly arrested and killed our embankment repair personnel; after August, the Chiang army launched a large-scale offensive against our area, destroying and looting our river management materials and equipment, with losses totaling 3.40415 billion yuan. Moreover, Chiang also dug fortifications under the river embankments that we had repaired, damaging the embankment body, and Chiang's planes constantly strafed our river management agencies and embankment repair workers, so our embankment repair work could not be carried out after August last year. Third, the Kuomintang has delayed the payment of riverbed residents' relief and relocation funds until now, and has not paid a penny, so we cannot handle the residents' relocation. Chiang Kai-shek, however, devoted all his efforts to unilaterally closing the breach at Huayuankou and digging two diversion rivers. By December last year, when the breach closure project was about to be completed, he sent personnel to our area under the pretext of inspecting the old course in the middle and lower reaches, again trying to deceive us. We immediately pointed out solemnly, based on the above facts, that the Kuomintang had repeatedly violated the agreement, delayed the payment of construction funds and relocation relief funds, which has now lasted for five months. Therefore, the Kuomintang's breach closure project at Huayuankou must also be postponed for five months before it can be completed. And immediately pay us various construction materials, construction funds, and riverbed residents' relocation fees as agreed. However, the Kuomintang representatives refused to discuss this reasonable proposal. After they returned, they immediately dug open the diversion rivers and released the river into the old course. Now the flood front has flowed through Shou Zhang. Wherever the water flows, the waves are torrential, villages and houses are destroyed, and residents are displaced, running around and crying out. The disaster is extremely serious. The editorial continued: Once the Yellow River floods into the Wei River, it will create a danger of floods flowing everywhere across the entire North China Plain. The editorial then called on the people of North China, people throughout the country, and fair-minded people in the world to take the following effective measures: (1) Immediately stop the Kuomintang's inhuman act of flooding North China. The Huayuankou breach closure project must be stopped immediately to preserve the lives of the people. (2) The Kuomintang should immediately allocate our construction funds, construction grain, equipment, and riverbed residents' relocation fees as agreed, so that we can carry out the necessary risk prevention work. (3) The Chiang army should immediately withdraw from the occupied old course area, ensuring that our embankment repair project can proceed safely. (4) The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) should immediately stop issuing and recover materials helping the Kuomintang close the breach, and immediately withdraw personnel helping the Kuomintang close the breach. Do not continue to be an accomplice in Chiang's creation of a historical tragedy. At the same time, we once again issue a serious protest to the Kuomintang and give them a final warning: You should know that the people in our area and North China will do their best to carry out self-rescue in this dangerous situation, and the Kuomintang should bear the consequences for all the events that occur as a result. Historical facts have proven countless times that those who cause historical tragedies will be punished by history. Those who inflict disasters on the people will be punished by the people. This is something that cannot be changed or escaped in the slightest.

　　蒋介石不顾民命悍放黄水
    下游居民村屋尽毁
    天寒地冻无衣无食情况严重
    冀鲁豫日报号召制止蒋方罪行
    蒋方应即拨付粮款及迁移费
    蒋军应即退出故道以便复堤
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】蒋介石不顾民命，悍然放水东淹解放区，现水头已过寿张，水流过处，一片汪洋，沿河居民仓惶奔逃，天寒地冻，无衣无食无家可归，情状至惨。冀鲁豫日报特发表社论，对蒋介石此种罪恶提出严重抗议，并号召全华北和全国全世界人士注意蒋贼之无耻恶毒阴谋。社论称：蒋介石利用黄水归故，淹没我区以及淹没整个华北之恶毒阴谋，经过一年来他们的种种欺瞒手法，即将造成大惨案。这一大惨案，所给予人民之灾害，其范围宽广而深重，将是史无前例的。自从归故问题提出后，我们仅向国方提出在黄河归故之前，应将故道河堤修复，整险与裁湾取直等工程办好，及河床居民迁出，以免造成新的水患。并以此最合理与最低之要求，虽与国方签订几次协议，如荷泽协议规定先复堤后堵口，开封与南京协议规定堵复并进，但堵口以不使中下游发生水患为原则，且复堤工程不受任何军事政治影响。上海协议规定恢复堤工粮、工款及河床居民迁移救济费等具体数字。但国民党在美帝国主义者支持下，进行巨大政治军事阴谋，所以我们与国方所订协议，均由国方失信撕毁。举其大者言之：一，复堤业已付出之工款，我们垫付了四十九万美元，国方尚未拨还，急要工程之工款国方则分文未付，致我未完堤工等工程，因无粮款而停顿。二，自去年三月至七月，国方大肆捕杀我方修堤人员；八月以后，蒋军大举进攻我区，将我方治河物资器材破坏抢劫一空，损失计达三十四亿零四百十五万元。且蒋并在我已修好之河堤下，挖掘工事，破坏堤身，蒋机并不断的扫射我方治河机关，及修堤员工，是以我自去年八月以后，复堤工程无法进行。三，河床居民救济迁移费，国方拖延至今分文未付，使我们无法办理居民迁移。而蒋介石则倾其全力片面的在花园口进行堵口，并挖通两条引河，至去年十二月间，堵口工程及将完成之时，假借视察中下游故道为名，派员来到我区，又想对我们实行欺骗；我们当即根据上述事实，严正指出：国方屡次破坏协议，推延拨付工款及迁移救济费，迄今已达五个月之久，因此国方在花园口堵口工程，亦必须推迟五个月之后方可完工。并立即依约拨付我们各种工料、工款及河床居民迁移费，而国方来人，对此至合情理之意见竟予拒绝商讨。而他们回去之后，立即挖开引河，放河流入故道，现水头已流过寿张，水流所至，波浪滔滔，村屋俱毁，居民颠沛流离奔走呼号，灾情极为严重。该社论继谓：一旦黄水泛入卫河，则将造成整个华北平原到处洪水横流之危险。接着该社论乃号召我华北人民全国人士与世界公正人士，采取以下有效措施：（一）立即制止国民党水淹华北之惨无人道的行为，必须立即停止花园口堵口工程，以保全人民生命。（二）依约由国方立即拨付我方工款、工粮、器材及河床居民迁移费，俾我们得以进行必要的防险工作。（三）蒋军应即从进占我故道区撤退，保证我们复堤工程得以安全进行。（四）联总应即停发并收回帮助国方堵口之物资，并立即撤回帮助国方堵口之人员。勿再继作蒋贼制造历史惨案之帮凶。同时我们再次向国民党提出严重抗议，并给他们最后警告：应知我区与华北人民，处此危境，必尽力进行自救，因此而发生之一切事件，国方当自食其果。历史事实已千百次的证明，造成历史惨案，必受历史之惩罚。给予人民灾害的，必受人民之处分，这是丝毫不可变更与无可逃避的。
