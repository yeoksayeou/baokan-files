In the Battle of Xitaiji, Dingtao

Six Warriors Annihilate Over a Hundred Enemies

Wu Xiang

When Chiang's troops break through and retreat in defeat, empty-handed cooks can often seize guns and capture prisoners. However, the fact that six warriors killed, wounded, and captured over a hundred Chiang soldiers entrenched in fortifications, seizing three heavy machine guns, four light machine guns, one light-heavy dual-purpose machine gun, and forty-three rifles, cannot but be described as a staggering record.

The Fourth Squad of the Twelfth Company of a certain regiment created this amazing record, commanded by the brave and resourceful squad leader Zheng Facheng.

At 9:00 PM on the 15th, exploding sparks constantly pierced the thick darkness of the night, and the roar of artillery shells and grenades drowned out the fierce gunfire, turning Xitaiji, Dingtao into a boiling oil pot. Squad Leader Zheng was the first to rush through the breach in the village wall, and five warriors closely followed, occupying a courtyard near the village wall. At this time, Chiang's firepower fiercely pressed over from the fortifications on the southeast village wall, blocking the passage through the breach. The second platoon leader shouted, "Advance!" Squad Leader Zheng responded, and led the soldiers like a ball of fire to pounce on the doorway of the first fortification. Before the Chiang soldiers could see who it was, they were all taken prisoner. Squad Leader Zheng turned the captured heavy machine gun in the fortification and immediately fired a burst forward, shouting, "Advance, occupy the fortifications, move quickly, spread out!" Under his cover, the warriors rushed forward and occupied three fortifications in a row.

In the darkness, only the sound of shouts from the village wall could be heard: "Seven prisoners have gone down!" "Five more prisoners have gone down!" New recruit Gong Buqing, with a bayonet pressed against a Chiang soldier's neck, captured two prisoners alone and seized an American-made light machine gun. Yang Yutang closely followed the squad leader and rushed forward along the village wall. They had just captured an American-made light-heavy machine gun when three Chiang soldiers charged back, sweeping with machine guns. The squad leader was hit by a bullet in his right arm, but he didn't even groan and threw a grenade. The Chiang soldiers' machine gun went silent, and they immediately rushed up to seize the machine gun. Gong Buqing and the deputy squad leader also rushed up. With a "whoosh," a bayonet pressed against a Chiang soldier's shoulder, and the Chiang soldier quickly shouted, "Surrender, surrender." When Old Gong saw that it was a heavy machine gun, he was overjoyed. He carried the gun body himself, and told the prisoner to carry the gun mount and send it down. Wen Ruzhao and Shi Zhongyi also seized a light machine gun and more than ten rifles along the way. The warriors converged and charged forward again.

Having suffered losses, the Chiang soldiers concentrated their strength to deal with this side. Machine guns swept over like a rainstorm. The deputy squad leader gloriously sacrificed himself. Everyone shouted angrily, "Avenge the deputy squad leader!"

At this time, dawn was approaching, and the sky was even darker. Gong Buqing heard footsteps and looked forward to see many Chiang soldiers charging with bayonets. He grabbed the muzzle of the gun of the one in the front, and that Chiang soldier turned his head and shouted, "Pass it back, rush, the front is right there." Old Gong kicked him over and also turned his head and shouted, "Machine gun, sweep them!" Our machine gun responded with a bang, immediately pushing the Chiang soldiers back. The sky gradually brightened, and the morning light was dazzling. In front of the warriors lay many Chiang soldiers' corpses and a large number of spoils.

    定陶西台集战斗中
    六勇士歼敌百余
    吴象
    当蒋军突围溃退的时候，空手的炊事员常常也可以缴枪捉俘虏。但是，六名勇士将固守工事的蒋军毙伤俘一百余，夺获重机枪三挺，轻机枪四挺，轻重两用机枪一挺，步枪四十三支，却不能不说是惊人的纪录。
    创造这惊人纪录的是某团十二连的第四班，指挥这个班的是勇敢机智的班长郑发成。
    十五日夜间九点钟，爆散的火花不断划破浓黑的夜幕，炮弹手榴弹的轰鸣盖没了激烈的枪声，定陶西台集变成了一个滚沸的油锅。郑班长第一个冲过寨墙的突破口，五个勇士都紧跟着跃进，占领了靠近寨墙的一座房院，这时蒋军的火力从东南寨墙上的工事里猛烈地压过来，封锁突破口的通路。二排长喊：“向前发展！”郑班长答应了一声，就带领战士们像一团火似的扑到第一个工事门口。蒋军还没有看清是谁，就都当了俘虏。郑班长扭转工事里缴获的重机枪，立即“答答答”向前打了一梭，边打边喊：“前进，占领工事，动作迅速，散开些！”勇士们在他掩护下向前冲去，一连就占了三个工事。
    黑暗中，只听寨墙上喊：“俘虏下去了七个！”“俘虏又下去了五个！”新战士巩步清一刺刀逼着蒋军的脖子，独自捉了两个俘虏，缴了一挺美式轻机枪。杨玉堂跟着班长紧贴寨墙向前冲，他们刚缴了一挺美式轻重机枪，三个蒋军端着机枪扫着反冲过来。班长右臂中了一弹，他连吭也不吭一声，就摔出了一颗手榴弹，蒋军机枪哑了，他们随即就冲上去夺那挺机枪，巩步清和副班长也冲上来了。“呼”的一声刺刀逼到了蒋军肩头，蒋军连忙喊：“缴枪，缴枪。”老巩一看是重机枪，可喜欢坏了，自己扛着枪身，叫俘虏抬着枪座，送了下去。文如沼和石忠义二人一路也缴了一挺轻机枪，十多枝步枪。勇士们汇合在一起，又向前冲。
    蒋军吃了亏，就集中力量来对付这边，机枪像暴雨似的扫过来，副班长光荣牺牲了，大家怒喊道：“为副班长报仇！”
    这时逼近黎明，天色更黑。巩步清听到脚步响，向前一看，是许多蒋军端着刺刀冲过来了，他一把抓住最前面一个的枪口，那个蒋军扭头叫道：“往后传，快冲，前面就是。”老巩一脚把他踢翻，也扭头叫道：“机枪快扫！”我们的机枪应声而响，立刻把蒋军压回去了。天渐渐亮起来，晨曦耀眼，勇士们面前横七竖八地躺着许多蒋军的尸体和大批的战利品。
