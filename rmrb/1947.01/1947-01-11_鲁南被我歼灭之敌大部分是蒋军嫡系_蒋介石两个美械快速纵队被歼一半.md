Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 9th. Our correspondent reports: Chiang Kai-shek spent three months cautiously advancing eastward from the Xia (Zhuang) Zao (Zhuang) line, covering less than sixty *li*, but in the face of the heroic counterattack by the Lunan People's Liberation Army, nearly 30,000 troops were annihilated in a matter of dozens of hours. The 26th Division and the Rapid Column, which were completely wiped out this time, were Chiang Kai-shek's prized possessions for waging the civil war. The 44th Brigade of the 26th Division was originally the main force of Xue Yue, a direct lineage of Chiang Kai-shek; the 169th Brigade was the elite force of Ma Liwu's original 169th Division; and the 80th Brigade Rapid Column was originally the 80th Division, where Chiang Kai-shek's nephew, Yu Jishi, had served as division commander. Chiang Kai-shek only had two fully American-equipped rapid columns in total, and the 80th Brigade Rapid Column, which was annihilated this time, was one of them. This rapid unit possessed a tank battalion with 24 medium tanks, which were drawn from the tank regiment directly under Chiang Kai-shek, with Chiang Kai-shek's second son, Chiang Wei-kuo, serving as the regimental commander. It also possessed an artillery regiment directly under Chiang Kai-shek, with 24 15-millimeter howitzers, as well as numerous other anti-tank guns, mountain guns, rocket launchers, and 60mm mortars. It also possessed a motor vehicle regiment with 150 armored cars, and was often supported by more than a dozen aircraft. The fact that such a well-equipped unit has fallen into the hands of the People's Liberation Army will greatly enhance the People's Liberation Army's modern equipment and mastery of modern warfare technology.

Xinhua News Agency, Lunan Front, 9th. On the night of the 4th, in the dim light, the reporter witnessed a scene of joy and tension on the victorious battlefield. Countless militiamen carrying guns shuttled back and forth along the way, busy transporting more than 20,000 prisoners. The brave and skilled New Fourth Army soldiers were loudly talking and laughing at this time, discussing the battles of the day. Thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's tank, armored car, and automobile drivers were standing in orderly lines in the fields, awaiting resettlement. Director Xie of a certain Shandong Liberation Army unit kindly said to some drivers standing near him, "Work hard here with us!" Immediately, more than a hundred drivers happily ran off to drive their original vehicles. For a time, many cars, armored cars, and tanks started up together, and hundreds of electric lights shone brightly like daylight, and within several *li* around ×× village, it almost felt like being in a city that never sleeps. The hundred-plus American-style trucks sent by Chiang Kai-shek's 26th Division were now speeding towards the rear, one after another.

　　鲁南被我歼灭之敌大部分是蒋军嫡系
  　蒋介石两个美械快速纵队被歼一半
    【新华社山东九日电】本社特派员报导：蒋介石花了三个月的时间，小心翼翼地由厦（庄）枣（庄）支线向东进攻，前进不足六十华里，但在鲁南人民解放军英勇反击下，数十小时内即被歼近三万人。这次全军覆没的蒋军二十六师，及快速纵队，是蒋介石进行内战的珍宝，二十六师的四四旅是蒋之嫡系薛岳原来的主力，一六九旅是马励武原一六九师的嫡系精锐，八十旅快速纵队是蒋介石的外甥俞济时曾任师长的八十师原部，蒋介石一共只有两个全部美械化的快速纵队，此次被歼灭的八十旅快速纵队，即就是其中的一个。这个快速部队拥有一个战车营，有中型坦克廿四辆，该战车营是蒋介石直辖的战车团拨出的，蒋介石以其次子蒋纬国充任该战车团团长。另拥有蒋介石直辖的炮兵团有十五米厘口径的榴弹炮二十四门、其他战防炮、山炮、火箭炮、六○炮甚多，还拥有一百五十辆装甲汽车的汽车团，经常有飞机十余架配合作战。这样一支优良装备的部队之落入人民解放军之手，将大大提高人民解放军的近代装备与掌握近代战争技术。
    【新华社鲁南前线九日电】四日夜色苍茫中，记者见到前线胜利后的战场上充满喜悦而紧张的景象，沿途无数荷枪的民兵往来如梭，忙于运送两万多个俘虏，英勇善战的新四军战士们，这时大声的谈笑，议论着白天的战斗。成千的蒋军战车装甲车和汽车的司机们，在田野规矩的站队，听候安置。山东解放军某部谢主任和蔼地对站在他附近的一些司机说：“好好在我们这里干吧”！立刻就有百多名司机喜悦地跑开，前去驾驶自己原来的汽车。一时许多辆汽车、装甲汽车和战车一齐开动，数百盏电灯明亮如同白昼，在××村周围数里内，几疑置身于不夜之城。蒋军二十六师送来的百余美式卡车，这时正首尾衔接地驰向后方。
