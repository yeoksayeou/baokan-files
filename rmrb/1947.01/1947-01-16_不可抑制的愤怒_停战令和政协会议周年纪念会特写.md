Unsuppressible Anger
    A Feature on the Anniversary of the Ceasefire Order and the Political Consultative Conference
    Ke Gang
    This is January 13th, 1947, in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region.
    In front of the row of white poplar trees on the riverbank in the border region government's location, over ten thousand liberated people and the army defending their liberation gathered in anger to commemorate the anniversary of the ceasefire order and the success of the Political Consultative Conference last year, vowing to fight to the end for the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference line and the ceasefire order.

    Regardless of which village they came from, the masses were drawn to the colored cartoon on the side of the stage depicting an American soldier forcibly dragging Ms. Shen in Beiping as soon as they entered the venue. People were shouting and discussing. An old woman with white and missing teeth from Zhao Yu Village laboriously tapped her cane and said, "Look at that beastly American soldier! This is not acceptable! We must immediately kick them out and bring our female students back, and let them go back and molest their own sisters!" A militiaman, surrounded by three or four people, said anxiously in a very loud voice: "Chiang Kai-shek is stubbornly opposing the people and is determined to sell out the country. Last year, he opened his big mouth and said there was a ceasefire! Ha! Who knew that in the blink of an eye he would attack us again! He wants to keep us from ever standing up! We must fight him to the end! I guarantee that as long as everyone is united, we will definitely defeat him. I participated in the Ping-Han battle last year, and I have seen his troops..." I asked him, "What's your name?" He said, "My name is Wang Wenqi." He didn't turn around to look at me, but kept talking excitedly, and more people gathered around.

    Suddenly, a string of dust was raised on the yellowish riverbed, and the guard regiment and the troops of the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army entered the venue, holding high the sky-blue horizontal banner with the words "American Troops Get Out of China Immediately!"

    In front of the stage, wind and percussion instruments sounded, exposing the bloody facts of the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families betraying the motherland and slaughtering the people. People flocked to it spontaneously. When Marshall took off his peaceful mask and arrogantly presented the Chiang-American commercial treaty for signing, when the traitor Chiang frantically and murderously raised his steel knife to slaughter the people, the audience shouted to fight and the roar shook the sky!

    After the skit "Chiang's Army Is Bound to Fail" ended, people couldn't help but boil over: "Oppose the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" "Defend the liberation, defend the border region!" The students of the county normal school and No. 9 High School roared angrily, "Vow to oppose the atrocities of the American troops!" "Vow to support the patriotic movement of students across the country!" "American troops get out of China immediately!" The loud slogans kept flying into the sky from their ranks until the meeting was announced with cannons.

    Vice Chairman Rong stood in front of the megaphone and spoke with excitement, telling how we had painfully accepted Marshall's extremely unfair military reorganization plan in order to implement the Political Consultative Conference line and the ceasefire order over the past year, and how we had withdrawn the troops that had entered Quwo City and the four passes of Liaocheng! Before he could finish speaking, a comrade, a company commander I didn't know, suddenly grabbed me and said, "I experienced it myself. We were on the stronghold of the puppet army in Liuyuan Taibao, Anyang, when we received the ceasefire order. We withdrew without stopping for even a minute. However, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army did not stop for even a minute and fired fiercely at our retreating troops, and attacked us again the next day. Some of our people were injured. Today, I believe that only by using our merciless counterattack can we implement the Political Consultative Conference line and the ceasefire order! The traitor Chiang Kai-shek has really taught me a lesson!"

    After speeches and proposals by Army Commander Kong of the 38th Army, Comrade Nie Zhen of the Central Bureau, and representatives of the masses, tens of thousands of people raised their iron fists, and the slogans resounded for a long time. The announcement from the stage that the meeting was adjourned seemed not to have been heard, and the crowd milled around the venue, shouting and reluctant to leave.

　　不可抑制的愤怒
    停战令和政协会议周年纪念会特写
    柯岗
    这是一九四七年晋冀鲁豫边区的一月十三日。
    边府驻地，那一排白杨树的面前河岸上，翻身人民和保卫人民翻身的军队，一万多人在这里愤怒集会，纪念去年今日的停战令和政协会议的成功，并誓为执行政协路线和停战令而奋斗到底。
    不管那村来的群众，他们一进会场，便被主席台边那幅美军强拉北平沈女士的彩色漫画吸引过去。人们嚷嚷着，议论着。赵峪村一位发白齿落的老太太，用拐杖吃力的敲着地说：“你看美国洋兵那禽兽样，这可不行呀！立刻就得叫他爬出去，把咱的女学生抢回来，叫他们回去拉他自己的姐妹吧！”一个民兵，被三四个人包围着，他用着非常高的嗓子，很着急的说：“蒋介石死跟老百姓作对，一心想卖国，去年他张大嘴说停战啦，嘿！谁知转眼功夫他又进攻咱啦！他想叫咱永世不能翻身！咱非跟他干到底不行！我保险，只要人人齐心，一定干过他，我去年参加平汉战，我见过他那队伍………”我问他：“你叫啥名字？”他说：“我叫王文其。”他并没有回头看我，一股劲的往下讲，另外又有些人围过来。
    忽然，淡黄色的河床上扬起一串沙尘，警卫团和西北民主联军第三十八军的队伍开进会场，在他们四路纵队的前面，高举着天蓝色的横旗，上书“美军立即滚出中国去！”
    主席台前管弦锣鼓响起来，蒋宋孔陈四大家族出卖祖国屠杀人民的史实，血淋淋的摆在面前了，人们不约而同的潮涌过去。当马歇尔脱下和平外衣，傲慢的拿出蒋美商约履行签字的时候，当蒋贼丧心病狂、杀气腾腾的轮起钢刀向人民屠杀的时候，观众万口喊打，吼声震天！
    这幕“蒋军必败”的活报结束之后，人们情不自禁的沸腾起来：“反对卖国贼蒋介石！”“保卫翻身、保卫边区！”县立师范和九高同学们愤怒的吼着“誓死反对美军暴行！”“誓死支援全国学生的爱国运动！”“美军立刻爬出中国去！”宏亮的口号，从他们的行列中不停的飞向上空，直到鸣炮开会的时候。
    戎副主席站在扩音机前，激愤的讲述着，一年来为了执行政协路线和停战令，我们是怎样忍痛接受马歇尔极不公平的整军方案，我们是怎样把打进曲沃城内和打进聊城四关的队伍撤出来！？他的话还未讲完，一个素不相识的连长同志突然把我拉住说：“我亲身经历过的，我们当时在安阳柳源太保伪军据点的寨上，接到了停战令，我们连一分钟也没有停就撤下来了。但是，蒋介石的伪军确是一分钟也没有停的向着我们撤退的队伍猛力射击，第二天又赶来袭击我们，我们有人负了伤。今天我相信只有用我们无情的反击去执行政协路线和停战令！蒋介石卖国贼真把我教训够了！！”
    三十八军孔军长、中央局聂真同志和群众代表等讲话提议后，万人举起铁拳，口号声经久不息。主席台上宣布散会的声音像是没有被人听见，人群满场回旋，高呼，不欲离去。
