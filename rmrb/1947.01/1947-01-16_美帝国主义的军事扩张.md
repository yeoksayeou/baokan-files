　　During the Second World War, the American army was scattered in more than fifty different regions, establishing 434 military bases located in areas including China, India, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, British islands in the Atlantic, islands in the Pacific, Latin America, Greenland, and Iceland.

　　In the Far East and Pacific region: the United States has long occupied countless strategic islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands in the central Pacific, Saipan, the Volcano Islands, Greater and Lesser Ryukyu Islands, Johnston Island, Midway Island, Wake Island, Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Truk and Palau; Manus Island, Samoa, and Jervis Island in the South Pacific; the Panama Canal Zone, as well as the Aleutian Islands, Attu Island, Dutch Harbor, Kiska, Kodiak, and Fairbanks Island in the North Pacific. After the end of the war against Japan, in order to control the entire Pacific, Dulles openly demanded at the United Nations General Assembly that the Ryukyu Islands, Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Kwajalein, which were under Japanese administration in the Pacific, be placed under U.S. "trusteeship." He further demanded that Britain cede sovereignty over islands in the southwestern Pacific, such as Christmas Island and Funafuti; in the supposedly "independent" Philippines, the United States also wanted to establish more than ten bases, including Manila. As for monopolizing Japan, partitioning southern Korea, and colonizing China, under the traps of the "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation," the "Sino-American Air Transport Agreement," etc., it transformed Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, etc., into its naval and air bases, and seized Indian air force bases through the "U.S.-India Air Agreement." These blatantly illustrate the ambition of the United States for military expansion in the Far East. The warlord MacArthur even arrogantly advocated that the United States should merge Australia, New Zealand, and Scotland, and even Hong Kong was included in the so-called "Maritime Maginot Line" plan from Southeast Asia to Japan.

　　In the Atlantic: the U.S. naval and air bases include Argentia Island, Coco Solo Island, Guantanamo Bay, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad, St. Thomas, Georgetown, Great Inagua, and the British Bermuda Islands obtained in exchange for fifty old destroyers, Antigua, Jamaica, and St. Lucia. In addition to the Portuguese Azores, Danish Greenland, Iceland, two strongholds in Canada, bases borrowed in Panama during the war, and the so-called "Pan-American Defense" plan, it can be said to have "encompassed" almost everything.

　　In the Mediterranean and Middle East, the United States is also actively plotting to intervene. Recently, the demonstration "patrol" of the battleship "Roosevelt" in the Mediterranean is a clear sign. Under the bait of so-called help for "re-establishment of a nation," it armed a large number of Jews to enter Palestine, signed an aviation agreement with Egypt, demanded the establishment of highways and airports from Afghanistan, and attempted to interfere in Greece and the Dardanelles Strait.

　　These numerous military bases and astonishing expansionist ambitions fully demonstrate that the United States wants to kick Britain to the outer edges of the Earth, plant the Stars and Stripes on all the British Empire's colonies, and "Americanize" all semi-colonial countries and small capitalist countries. The facts are as clear as day: the bases in the central and southern Pacific surround British Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Malaya; the bases in the Atlantic block Canada and keep watch over Africa; Greenland and Iceland are tightly nailed to the British Isles, and U.S. warships can strike London, 1,170 miles away, from the capital of Iceland at any time. The Azores are a hub threatening the British Empire's Mediterranean and transoceanic (Atlantic and Indian Ocean) routes. As for the issues of Palestine, Egypt, India, and Greece, they are also ailments in the heart of the British Empire. The bases controlled by U.S. imperialism in China, Japan, Korea, and the North Pacific, although posing as a countermeasure against the Soviet Union, are actually a smokescreen, and are instead intended to suppress and enslave the people of the East. In the face of the world's vast people fighting for peace and democracy with unparalleled power, U.S. imperialist elements who are frantically pursuing a policy of expansion will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the "Third Reich."

　　美帝国主义的军事扩张
    本报资料室
    在第二次世界大战中，美国军队散布在五十多个不同地区，建立了四三四处军事基地，其所在地分布于中国、印度、埃及、澳洲、纽西兰、菲律滨、大西洋英属各岛，太平洋各岛、拉丁美洲、格陵兰及冰岛等。
    在远东太平洋方面：美国早就据有着无数的战略岛屿，如中太平洋的夏威夷群岛，塞班岛，火山岛，大中琉球岛，约翰斯敦岛，中途岛，威克岛，安尼威托克岛，瓜加林岛，吐鲁克与帕劳；南太平洋的孟纽斯岛，萨摩亚岛，柔立司岛；巴拿马运河区域，以及北太平洋的阿留申群岛，阿图岛，荷兰港，凯史卡，可第亚及范朋克岛。对日战争结束后，美国为了控制整个太平洋，杜勒斯就在联合国大会上公开要求将日本在太平洋统管的琉球岛，琉璜岛，塞班岛及华杰林岛置于美国“托管”之下，更要求英国把西南太平洋的圣诞岛，福那福第等岛的主权让给它；在所谓“独立”了的菲律滨，美国也还要建立马尼拉等十多处基地。至于独霸日本，割据鲜南，殖民地化中国，在“蒋美商约”，“蒋美航空协定”等等圈套之下，变上海、天津、广州、青岛、秦皇岛，……等为其海空基地，并以“美印航空协定”攫取印度空军基地。这些都露骨的说明了美国在远东之军事扩张的野心。军阀头子麦克阿瑟甚至狂妄的主张美国要将澳洲，纽西兰及苏格兰合并，连香港也被圈入在所谓南洋至日本“海上马其诺”计划之中。
    在大西洋方面：美国的海空军基地有阿根都亚岛，科科苏禄岛，危他那摩岛，波多黎各岛及铁里尼达岛，圣汤马斯，乔治顿，大伊哈马及以五十艘旧驱逐舰换来的英属百尔慕他群岛，安抵圭，牙买加，圣路济亚各岛。加上葡属亚速尔岛，丹属格陵兰、冰岛，加拿大的两个据点，在巴拿马战时借用的基地，以及所谓“泛美联防”计划，可以说是“囊括”殆尽了。
    在地中海中东一带，美国也是积极图谋插足的，日前，“罗斯福”号主力舰之示威“巡逻”于地中海，就是一个显明的征象。在所谓帮助“复国”的钓饵下，武装大批的犹太人进入巴勒斯坦，和埃及订立航空协定，向阿富汗要求建立公路与飞机场，并图染指希腊和达达尼尔海峡。
    这些星罗棋布的军事基地和惊人的扩张野心，充分说明美国想把英国一脚踢到地球外边去，把大英帝国殖民地都插上星纹的花旗，而且一切的半殖民地国家和弱小的资本主义国家，都要予以“美化”。事实了如指掌，中南太平洋的基地，团团围住英属澳大利亚，纽西兰，香港和马来；大西洋的基地，封锁着加拿大，看守着阿非利加；格陵兰和冰岛紧钉住英伦三岛，美国军舰随时可以从冰岛首都突击相距一千一百七十英里的伦敦。亚速尔岛更是威胁大英帝国地中海航线上和两洋（大西洋印度洋）航线的枢纽。至于巴勒士坦、埃及、印度、希腊的问题，也是英帝国的腹心之疾。美帝国主义在中国、日本、朝鲜以及北太平洋所控制的基地，虽然作着对付苏联的姿态，实际上这只是一种障眼法，而却是为着镇压与奴役东方的人民。在具有着无比威力的为和平民主而斗争的世界广大人民之前，疯狂地进行着扩张政策的美帝国主义分子，终必重蹈“第三帝国”的覆辙。
