Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 10th. General Yang Chengyuan, former commander-in-chief of Yan Xishan's Jinxi Army, who laid down his arms in the Xixian Campaign, has arrived at the military region's headquarters. He was amazed by the prosperous scenes of reconstruction in liberated areas such as Lishi, Lin, and Xing counties. He said, "Along the way, I did not see a single wasteland or a beggar or opium addict. Men, women, old and young are all living a very happy life of farming and weaving." These achievements are all due to the implementation of democratic politics. He said, "The humble style of the military and political personnel and their family-like relationship with the masses are the only things I have seen in my life." Speaking of Yan Xishan's "soldier-peasant unity" tyranny, he said, "The land of the rich is 'annexed' by the 'soldiers,' and the poor are unwilling to produce due to the heavy burden, resulting in people fleeing and the land being deserted."

    盛赞解放区民主建设
    【新华社晋绥十日电】隰县战役放下武器之阎军晋西总指挥杨澄源上将，已抵达军区驻地。他为解放区如离石、临、兴等县重建后的繁荣景象所惊诧，他说：“我沿途没有看见一块荒地与一个乞丐烟民，男女老少都过着很愉快的耕织生活”。这些成绩都是由于实行了民主政治。他说：“军政人员谦和的作风和群众亲如家人的关系，是我有生以来所仅见”。谈到阎锡山“兵农合一”的暴政，他说：“富者土地被‘兵’‘并’走，贫者因负担繁重而不愿生产，致人民相率逃亡，土地荒芜”。
