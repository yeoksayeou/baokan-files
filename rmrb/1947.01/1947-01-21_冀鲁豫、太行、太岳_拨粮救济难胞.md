    Allocate Grain to Relieve Distressed Compatriots
    [Reported by our newspaper from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 18th] After the recovery of Juan and Yun cities, the democratic government provided relief to the disaster victims. Now, in order to ensure that the disaster victims can have a full year-end and survive the spring famine, the administrative office has allocated 140,000 jin of grain for further relief. During the first relief effort in Juan City, each person received 10 to 30 jin of rice, saving more than 300 people from starvation. This time, each person will receive at least 50 to 150 jin of grain. Each household will be able to solve their living problems for two to three months. After the recovery of Yun City, the district governments immediately implemented emergency relief for the refugees and have now allocated 70,000 jin of relief grain.
    [Reported by our newspaper] The Hui County Democratic Government allocated grain to relieve the people in the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops who suffered. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded Hui County, the grain and clothing of about ×0,000 people were robbed, and 80% of them have suffered from hunger and cold since the beginning of winter. In addition to organizing some people to go to the base areas for production and self-salvation, our democratic government has allocated 1,000 shi of grain and transported it to the disaster-stricken areas under armed cover to relieve all the suffering people.

    [Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue on the 17th] The military and civilians of the Seventh Sub-district economize on food and clothing to relieve the masses affected by the Chiang-Yan offensive. When the Chiang-Yan troops jointly launched an offensive against the mountainous areas of southern Shanxi last December, they implemented the "Three Alls" policy, committing adultery, arson, and murder everywhere, resulting in losses to the masses unprecedented in eight years. In the fourth district of Xia County alone, according to incomplete statistics, 427 houses were burned down, 91 head of livestock, 120 pigs, and 2,200 shi of grain were lost. After the local military and civilians crushed the enemy's offensive, the Xia County Democratic Government specially issued 7,500 jin of grain for relief, and various agencies also economized on food and clothing to help with more than 500 jin of millet, 110,000 yuan in legal tender, dozens of pieces of cotton clothing, shoes and socks, and more than 400 jin of salt. County head Wei and Councilor Chang organized a慰问团 to visit the villages to express their condolences and solve the masses' specific difficulties in clothing, food, and housing. Councilor Chang, who is a doctor, also brought a large number of medicines to treat the injured masses.
