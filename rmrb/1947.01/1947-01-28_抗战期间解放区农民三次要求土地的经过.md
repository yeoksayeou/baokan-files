    The Course of Three Times Farmers in Liberated Areas Demanded Land During the War of Resistance Against Japan
    Providing consultation for everyone, asking everyone to be consultants, feel free to ask questions, and if you don't understand, ask others.
    To the Editor:
    In our study of Comrade Bo Yibo's New Year's Message "New Year's Message - Review and Prospect" there is a line "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, farmers reached out three times to demand the realization of 'land to the tiller', but we did not approve..." What were those three times? What was the process? Please answer.
    Reader Wu Bixiu
    Comrade Bixiu:
    Regarding the question you asked, I happened to see an article in the Liberation Daily about it, which is reprinted as follows: "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, every time the peasant movement in our liberated areas reached a climax, they would demand land. Although the time and number of times this request was made varied in each liberated area, looking at the entire liberated area, there were three times that were larger in scale: The first time was from the autumn of 1937 to the beginning of 1938, when the Eighth Route Army marched into the enemy's rear, people's hearts were greatly encouraged, and farmers joined the army and the war one after another, and demanded a solution to the land problem. The second time was from the second half of 1939 to the first half of 1940, when the Japanese invaders returned to North China and the reactionaries launched the first anti-communist high tide. Some stubborn landlords in the liberated areas took advantage of the situation to counterattack the peasants, some even acting as internal collaborators for the enemy and the stubborn elements. The peasants and the Eighth Route Army fought back against the Japanese 'mopping up' operations and the anti-communist high tide, and at the same time, they put forward the demand for land, and in some places, they actually stopped paying rent, and in some places, the peasants automatically divided some land from the landlords. The third time was from the winter of 1942 to the spring of 1944, when each liberated area, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, universally and deeply implemented the work of rent reduction, interest reduction, investigation and reduction to strengthen unity in the countryside. Most of the peasants solved the problem of 'who supports whom' ideologically, and realized that the root cause of the peasants' poverty was the unreasonable distribution of land, and therefore demanded a thorough solution to the land problem." The situation of the peasant movement in our border area during the War of Resistance Against Japan was roughly the same; you can recall the actual situation in our area, and you will understand it more specifically.

    抗战期间解放区农民三次要求土地的经过
    为大家作顾问请大家当顾问大家有问尽管问不懂再向大家问编辑同志：
    我们学习元旦薄一波同志的“新年献词——回顾与前瞻”中有“在抗战期间，农民曾三次伸出手来要求实现耕者有其田，我们没有批准……”是那三次呢？经过怎样？请予答复。
    读者吴必修必修同志：
    你们问的问题，凑巧看到解放日报有篇有关的文章，兹转载如下：“抗战期间，我解放区农民运动每逢高潮，就要取得土地，虽此项要求在各解放区的时间与次数不尽相同，但就整个解放区看，规模较大者有三次：第一次是在一九三七年秋至一九三八年初，当时八路军向敌后进军，人心大振，农民纷纷参军参战，并要求解决土地问题。第二次在一九三九年下半年至一九四○年上半年，日寇回师华北，反动派发动第一次反共高潮，解放区部分顽固地主乘势向农民反攻，有的甚至充当敌顽内应，农民与八路军一起，打退了日寇‘扫荡’与反共高潮，同时提出了土地的要求，并且有的地方，实际上停止交租，有的地方，农民自动从地主手中分得一些土地。第三次由一九四二年冬一直到一九四四年春，各解放区根据中共中央指示，普遍深入的贯彻减租减息与查减工作，以加强农村中的团结，大部农民在思想上解决了‘谁活养谁’的问题，认识了农民的穷根，就是土地分配不合理，因而要求彻底解决土地问题。”我边区抗战期间农民运动的情形，大致相同；你们可联系我区实际情形回想一下，就会了解得更具体了。
