(From our newspaper in Changzhi, 15th) In order to finally eliminate feudal remnants, eradicate extreme poverty, and completely realize "land to the tiller," the CCP Taihang District Committee issued instructions on December 28 regarding the movement to thoroughly investigate rent reduction in old liberated areas. The instructions first described the basic situation of the old liberated areas, then pointed out: (1) It is imperative to fully implement the mass line. Pay attention to the opinions and demands of the majority of the masses, especially the poor and impoverished masses (those who have not turned over or have not thoroughly turned over), focusing on solving the issues of land, farming tools, and housing. In the process of solving these, some "inner contradictions" can also be addressed. At the same time, target only landlords who possess excessive land or have been consistently reactionary. Middle peasants, well-to-do middle peasants, and newly emerging middle peasants and rich peasants after the War of Resistance Against Japan must not be infringed upon in any way. In the distribution of fruits of victory, the scope should be broad, and it should be discussed democratically by the masses. (2) Distinguish clearly between eliminating feudalism and eliminating special agents. Although there is a close connection between the two, they cannot be conflated to avoid being exploited by special agents or shifting the target. It should be known that the main purpose of this investigation and rent reduction is to eliminate feudal exploitation. (3) Landlords with national consciousness and relatively enlightened attitudes during the War of Resistance Against Japan should be united and taken care of, allowing them to resolve their issues through the method of donating land and money. Special care should be given to cadres' and military personnel's family members who are of landlord status, and the phenomenon of not allowing them to donate land must be patiently and resolutely overcome. Landlords who have already solved the land problem in the past and have started their businesses through their own hard work should be encouraged and not struggled against again. For lonely and widowed landlords, peaceful solutions should be found, and excessive struggle should be avoided. (4) Efforts should be concentrated on deeply and meticulously leading this movement, and combined with winter literacy education to further elevate the masses. The time should not be dragged out too long, lest it delay winter production. Finally, the instructions pointed out that in backward villages in the old liberated areas that have not mobilized the masses or have not mobilized them sufficiently, it is necessary to re-mobilize them fully. One cannot simply assume that they are old liberated areas and fail to differentiate between advanced and backward areas, thereby relaxing the opportunity to fully mobilize the masses and affecting land reform.

　　中共太行区党委
    指示老区彻底查减
    【本报长治十五日电】为最后扫清封建残余，消灭赤贫，完全实现耕者有其田，中共太行区党委于十二月二十八日发出关于老区查减运动的指示。该指示首述老区基本情况后，指出：（一）必须充分贯彻群众路线。注意多数群众，尤其是贫苦群众（未翻身或未彻底翻身的）的意见与要求，着重解决土地、耕具和房屋问题，在解决中，可以结合解决一些内瓤子问题。同时只能对准保有过多土地或一贯反动的地主，对中农，富裕中农及抗战后新兴的中农、富农必须毫不侵犯。在果实分配上，面要宽，要经过群众民主讨论。（二）肃清封建与肃清特务要分别清楚，两者间虽有密切联系，但不能混同起来，免被特务钻空子或转移目标。应知此次查减主要目的是在消灭封建剥削。（三）对抗战中具有民族意识、比较开明的地主，应该团结并加以照顾，允以献田献金方式解决其问题。对地主成份的干属、军属尤应照顾，必须耐心的、坚决的克服不允他们献田的现象。对过去已经解决了土地问题，由于自己勤劳而又起家的地主，应予鼓励，不可再斗。对孤寡地主应和平解决，不过分斗争。（四）应集中力量深入细致的领导这一运动，并结合冬学教育更加提高群众，时间上不可拖得太长，致误冬季生产。最后指出老区过去未发动群众或发动不充分的落后村，必须重新充分发动，不能单纯以为是老区而不区别先进、落后，放松充分发动群众的时机，影响土地改革。
