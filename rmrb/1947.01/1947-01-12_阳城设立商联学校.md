　　[Taiyue News, 10th of this month] Yangcheng is correctly implementing its industrial and commercial policies. In three months this year, it has added more than 70 private shops and cooperatives of all sizes, bringing the total to around 400, while there are only over 90 public-owned shops. The markets in Dongguan, Nanguan, and the city have become even more prosperous. Recently, in order to further develop private capital in the liberated areas and resist the influx of American goods, the government is starting to rectify and improve the Commercial Union. A Commercial Union School was established on the 16th, utilizing the morning off-time, inviting cadres from the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the bank to explain commercial policies and foreign trade.

　　阳城设立商联学校
    【本报太岳十日电】阳城正确执行工商业政策，年内三个月中增加大小私营商店合作社七十余家，连原有的共达四百家左右，其中公营商店只有九十多家。东关、南关及城内的市场更趋繁荣。最近政府为了更进一步发展解放区私人资本，抵制美货侵入，正开始整顿与健全商联会，十六日并成立一商联学校，利用早晨空间，聘请工商局及银行的干部讲解商业政策及对外贸易。
