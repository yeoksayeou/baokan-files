　　Ten Days of Annihilating Thirty-Three Enemies
　　Anyang Landmine Warfare Demonstrates Power
　　Huixian Local Armed Forces Penetrate Deep Behind Enemy Lines to Launch Proactive Attacks
　　[Reported from Anyang by our newspaper] Anyang's landmine warfare is showing great power, with thirty-three enemies killed or wounded in ten days. From the 20th to the 30th of last month, in the forty-li plain stretching from Shuiye and Guantai in the north to Zhang Tanggou (under Tangyin jurisdiction) in the south, mines were laid everywhere to blockade and strike the enemy. For example, in Xiabao Village, eight li from Shuiye, because of the minefields inside and outside the village, when seventy enemies went to loot grain on the 23rd, they triggered a mine at the village entrance and dared not enter the village rashly. Comrade Li Yubao of the Seventh District led militiaman Wu Yinsheng on a long-distance mission to Zhang Tanggou, where they cut more than ten jin of enemy wires and buried landmines under the telegraph poles; the next day, an enemy squad with a machine gun went to connect the wires, and when the minefield exploded, two enemies were seriously injured and the machine gun was destroyed. In total, there were seventeen explosions in ten days, with thirty-one mines detonated, killing or wounding thirty-three enemies.
　　[Report from this newspaper] Taking advantage of the enemy's insufficient forces and empty rear, our Huixian militia, guerrillas, armed work teams, and main force troops cooperated with each other and launched attacks in all directions, leaving the enemy unable to attend to both ends and beaten everywhere. In December, they launched fifteen attacks, killing more than one hundred enemy puppet troops, and annihilating "Homecoming Legion" leaders Chen Xiangfu, Sang Baoren, Qin Xiliang and the three reactionary armed forces they led. They uprooted enemy strongholds in Tugao, Nansu, and seventeen other places, and burned sixty-nine blockhouses inside the strongholds; they seized three machine guns and more than thirty rifles. Forty-two villages that fell into enemy hands in September of last year have been liberated again. Thus, on the one hundred and twenty-li-long border guerrilla line, our guerrilla forces have completely turned to the offensive. The Jiang clique's puppet troops in strongholds such as Wucun and Luzhuang are extremely isolated and dare not stay in the villages at night. Currently, our small armed forces can also move into enemy territory at any time.

　　十天歼敌三十三名
    安阳地雷战发挥威力
    辉县地方武装深入敌后主动出击
    【本报安阳讯】安阳地雷战大显神威，十天伤亡敌人三十三名。上月二十日至三十日，北起水冶、观台，南迄张唐沟（汤阴属）四十华里平原上，到处布雷封锁、打击敌人。如距水冶八里的下堡村，因村内外布有雷阵，二十三号敌七十人前去抢粮，于村口踏响一雷，遂不敢冒然进村。七区李玉保同志带领民兵武银生远征张唐沟时，割敌电线十多斤，于电杆下埋好地雷；第二天敌人一班附机枪一挺前去接线，雷阵一响，敌两名重伤，机枪炸毁。总计十天中爆炸十七次，响雷三十一枚，死伤敌人三十三名。
    【本报讯】在敌人兵力不足，后方空虚情况下，我辉县民兵、游击队、武工队和主力兵团互相配合，四处出击；使敌人首尾难顾，到处挨打。计十二月内共出击十五次，毙敌伪百余名，歼灭“还乡团”头子陈相甫、桑保仁、秦喜良及其率领的三股反动武装。拔掉敌据点土高、南宿等十七处，烧毁据点内炮楼六十九座；缴获机枪三挺，步枪三十多支。自去年九月沦于敌手四十二个村庄，重获解放。至此，在一百二十里长的边沿游击线上，我游击部队完全转入主动。吴村、鲁庄等据点蒋伪军极其孤立，夜间不敢在村里住。目前，我小股武装并可随时深入敌后活动。
