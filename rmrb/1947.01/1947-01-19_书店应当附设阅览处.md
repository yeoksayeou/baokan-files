　　Everyone's Opinion

　　Bookstores Should Include Reading Rooms

    We believe Comrade Zhou Fang's suggestion is very good. Not only can the Yetao Xinhua Bookstore try it out, but all bookstores in our entire border region may as well try it. At the same time, we hope that each bookstore will tell us the results and experiences of the trial, so that we can promote it.
    ——Editor

    Editor Comrade:

    I saw the newly established Xinhua Bookstore retail department in Yetao, Wu'an, with shelves full of new books. Unfortunately, I can only stand outside the counter and take a look. If I want to browse a bit and know its contents in order to choose to buy it, I can't. Therefore, I suggest that the store: pick one of each type of book, put it in a small bookshelf on the desk, and place it on the counter for people to browse, so that the bookstore is like a library. The Xinhua Bookstore in Yan'an has seats outside the counter for reading, so readers come in an endless stream. The bookstore can therefore further serve the masses and also increase buyers. Of course, there will be many practical difficulties in doing so, such as having to change books, because the account has been recorded and cannot be changed, and being afraid of losing books or reducing buyers if readers can read them freely. In fact, these can all be overcome with ideas. Please consider this small suggestion, especially the leading comrades of the store's working comrades.
    Reader Zhou Fang

### 书店应当附设阅览处

　　书店应当附设阅览处
    周方同志的这个建议，我们认为很好，不仅冶陶新华书店可以试办，咱们全边区的书店，都不妨来试办一下，同时并希各书店把试办的结果与经验，告诉我们，以便推广。
    ——编者编辑同志：
    我在武安冶陶新设的新华书店门市部，看到新书满架，可惜只能站在柜台外边看看，要想浏览一下，略知其内容，以便选择购买，却不能够。因此，我建议该店：将每种书籍，各挑一本，装在案头小书架内，放在柜台上，任人翻阅，使书店图书馆化。延安新华书店柜台外即设有坐位，可供阅览，于是读者川流不息。书店因此能更进一步为群众服务，同时也增加了买主。当然这样做一定会有许多实际困难的，如要换书，因记好了账，不能更改，书随便让读者看，又怕遗失或减少买主，其实这都是可以想法子克服的。这个小建议，是否有当，请该店工作同志特别是领导同志考虑一下。
