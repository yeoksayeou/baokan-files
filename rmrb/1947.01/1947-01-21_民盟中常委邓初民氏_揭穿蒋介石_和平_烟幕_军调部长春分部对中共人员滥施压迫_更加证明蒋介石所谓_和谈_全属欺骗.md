　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Chongqing dispatch: After the news of the Kuomintang authorities' deployment of a new "peace offensive" reached here late last month, Mr. Deng Chumin, a Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League, wrote an article in the Democratic Daily on the 13th to expose it, denouncing it as "a kind of smoke screen." He pointed out that the role of the Kuomintang authorities in doing this was mainly to shirk responsibility for future wars, to carry out new military deployments under the cover of "peace," and to dilute the one-party nature and the killing nature of the "National Assembly." Deng said: "Judging from many facts in the past, the Kuomintang authorities have always chanted the tune of 'peace' when their military offensives have suffered setbacks or when their military preparations have not been completed. In the past few months, the Kuomintang army has suffered heavy losses, so it needs to be rearranged and carried out under the offensive of 'peace'." Deng also explained: "Today, the harm of the Chinese and American reactionaries to the Chinese people is all coordinated, and the 'peace' offensive is also coordinated." Deng said: "Marshall did not seize the opportunity to improve the peace talks before the 'National Assembly' was held, and now he is doing it again. This is clearly 'a hypocritical crocodile tears'."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: According to a Beiping dispatch: The CCP side of the Beiping Mediation Executive Department suddenly received an oral notice from the American side on the 17th, stating that the CCP radio station dispatched to the Changchun sub-division of the Military Mediation Department has been banned from sending messages, and the CCP personnel in the sub-division are not allowed to go out after 5:00 pm, which is like imprisonment. This is the first manifestation of the Military Mediation Department's dynamics after Marshall returned to the United States, and its significance is extremely serious. CCP Committee Member Ye Jianying has lodged representations with the United States and the Kuomintang on the basis of reason, opposing this unreasonable measure. The oppressive measures taken by the Changchun sub-division of the Military Mediation Department against CCP personnel further prove that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "peace talks" are entirely deceptive.

　　民盟中常委邓初民氏
    揭穿蒋介石“和平”烟幕
    军调部长春分部对中共人员滥施压迫
    更加证明蒋介石所谓“和谈”全属欺骗
    【新华社延安十八日电】重庆讯：上月下旬，国民党当局布置新“和平攻势”的消息传至此间后，民盟中常委邓初民氏当于十三日民主报上撰文予以揭露，斥之为“一种烟幕”，指出国民党当局这样搞的作用，主要是推卸未来大战的责任，在“和平”掩护下进行新的军事布置，并借此来冲淡“国大”的一党性及其杀伐性等。邓氏说：“从过去许多事实看，国民党当局都是在军事进攻遭了挫折或是军事准备未完成的时候就高唱‘和平’调子。几个月来，国民党军遭受了重大损失，因此还需从新布置一番，还要在‘和平’的攻势下来进行。”邓氏并说明：“今天中美反动派对于中国人民的危害是一切都配合着的，‘和平’攻势也是配合着的。”邓氏称：“马歇尔在‘国大’开会前不抓着时机把和谈搞好，到今天再来搞，这明明是‘猫哭老鼠假慈悲’。”
    【新华社延安十八日电】据北平讯：驻北平调处执行部中共方面十七日突然接到美国方面口头通知，谓军调部派至长春分部之中共电台已被禁止发报，分部之中共人员下午五时后即不准外出，俨如禁锢。此为马歇尔回国后军调部动态之首次表现，意义至为严重。中共方面叶委员剑英已据理向美国及国民党方面提出交涉，反对此项无理措施。按军调部长春分部对中共人员之压迫措施，更加证明蒋介石之所谓“和谈”全属欺骗。
