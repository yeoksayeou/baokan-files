　　Taihang Guerrilla Corps Annihilates 400 Enemies in a Week
　　[Our newspaper Changzhi dispatch, 17th] In the second week of 1947, the Taihang troops annihilated more than 400 enemies and recovered three Chiang-puppet strongholds, including Shizhai. The Taihang Military Region Headquarters recently issued a combat communiqué for the week of the 5th to 12th, stating: In the past week, the guerrilla corps active in the border areas of northern Henan and central Shanxi and behind enemy lines have taken the initiative to attack the enemy. Chiang, Yan, and puppet "Homecoming Legions" and other local secret service armed forces are being beaten everywhere. At 1:00 AM on the 5th, a unit of our 52nd Detachment, in coordination with the militia of the 8th District of Anyang, attacked the "Homecoming Legion" stronghold in Shizhai (south of Anyang). The battle began in the outskirts of the village. Our army braved the enemy's dense firepower and used a bag-shaped encirclement to pursue all the hundred or so enemies into a house in the village. We immediately organized a strong fire network to launch a fierce assault. The battle lasted only ten minutes. Except for more than ten enemies who escaped, all were annihilated. The village was completely captured by us. A total of 17 enemies were killed or captured, 55 were captured alive, and the spoils of war included one American-style machine gun, 45 rifles, three warhorses, more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 200 hand grenades, and ten pillboxes were leveled. In this battle, the militia of the 8th District cooperated with the troops in combat and were extremely brave and calm. After the battle, the 52nd Detachment specially awarded the militia of the district 10,000 yuan to encourage them. On the same day, the Pingding Corps on the northern front annihilated nearly 200 enemies in Chenjiazhuang (see this newspaper on the 10th). On the evening of the 6th, a unit of our 49th Detachment raided the puppet stronghold in Nanyang (under the jurisdiction of Ji and Qi counties), wounding three puppet security team members and capturing eight. We seized seven rifles and one pistol and immediately recovered the village. On the 9th, our 50th and 53rd Detachments launched a strong attack on the puppet security regiment in Fanglan Village, Qi County. After three hours of fierce fighting, more than 20 enemies were killed or wounded, 46 were captured, and the spoils of war included one light machine gun, 43 rifles, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and three pillboxes were leveled. At the same time, our 49th Detachment raided the puppet stronghold of Nianzao Village in Ji County, killing or wounding ten puppet security team members, capturing 43, and seizing 20 rifles, immediately liberating the village. On the 11th, our Bo'ai Independent Battalion attacked the enemy's stronghold in Gongcun. The battle was resolved in ten minutes, with six enemies killed and six captured. We seized one light machine gun, six rifles, and more than 400 rounds of ammunition. We only used more than ten rounds of ammunition and six hand grenades, and there were no casualties. On the morning of the 12th, our Taigu Independent Battalion ambushed the Second General Team of the 23rd Regiment of Yan's Security Forces, who were looting grain in Dongli. When the enemy fell into the ambush, we bombarded them with hundreds of hand grenades, ending the battle in five minutes. A total of more than 20 enemies were wounded, ten were captured, and the spoils of war included two light machine guns, ten rifles, two small cannons, one grenade launcher, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. We suffered no casualties.
