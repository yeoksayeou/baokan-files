    Party School of the Fourth Prefecture Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    Carries Out Mass Work in Station Area
    Publicizing Current Affairs, and Conserving Civilian Labor
    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office, 3rd] In order to save civilian labor and strengthen ties with the masses, the Party School of the Fourth Prefecture Committee decided to carry out mass work in the station area, and clearly put forward three tasks: 1. To help farmers with production, reduce corvée labor, and strengthen relations with the masses in the station area. 2. To carry out propaganda, strengthen mass education on current affairs and ideological education. 3. To conduct investigations and research in the station area, help village cadres solve various problems, and specifically decide to regard themselves as a part of the local militia, with all the duties of preferential treatment for military families being borne by comrades from the school. A check-up on the mass work in the stationed villages over the past month has shown significant results. Landlords, military families, and the general public highly praise this style of work. Students also personally push the millstone and grindstone, ensuring that they do not ask the people for a single animal or dispatch a single civilian laborer. Cadres, students, correspondents, and cooks of the school all responded enthusiastically. Cadres and students take turns on duty, each person pushing the millstone every two or three days, each time pushing three catties of grain, while talking during the pushing, which does not hinder learning. In this way, the labor concept of the comrades has been strengthened, and the burden on the people has been reduced. Significant results have also been achieved in the second task. According to the changes in the war situation, many mass meetings have been held to carry out current affairs education, so that the masses understand the characteristics of mobile warfare and have confidence in victory.

    冀鲁豫四地委党校
    进行驻地群众工作
    宣传时事节约民力
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】四地委党校，为了节省民力，密切与群众的联系，决定进行驻地群众工作，并明确的提出三个任务：一、帮助农民生产，减轻支差，密切与驻地群众的关系。二、进行宣传，加强群众时事教育与思想教育。三、进行驻地调查研究，帮助村干解决各种问题，并具体决定把自己当作自卫队的一部分，凡是优待军属的一切差务统由学校同志们担负。一月来对驻村群众工作作了检查，有显著的成绩。房东、军属与一般群众对这种作风很称赞。学生还亲自动手，推磨推碾子，保证不给老百姓要一个牲口，不派一个民夫。学校的干部、学员、通讯员、伙夫均热烈的响应，干部学员轮流值班，每人每两三天推一次磨，每人每次推粮食三斤，一面推磨，一面交谈，不防碍学习。这样一来加强了同志们的劳动观念，减轻了人民的负担。在第二个任务上也有显著的成绩，根据战争形势的变化，开了不少的群众大会，进行时事教育，群众了解运动战的特点，有了胜利的信心。
