It is reported that our Yu-Wan-Su troops, with a surprising move on January 7th, captured the city of Woyang in northwestern Anhui, following their victory two months ago in the Zaoziji battle, where they annihilated the entire Hao County Security Regiment, and the victory in the Longquji battle on the Qi-Tai Highway, where they annihilated the 190th Regiment of the 64th Brigade of the Kuomintang's reorganized 15th Division, and over 500 men from the 2nd Henan Security Regiment. We extend our sincere respect to the heroic commanders and fighters on the Yu-Wan-Su front on behalf of the military and civilians of the entire region!

Our Yu-Wan-Su troops have been fighting arduously and persisting in this enemy-occupied base since the War of Resistance. They are now deep in the rear of the Kuomintang army, directly threatening the Jinpu and Longhai main lines (the Kuomintang's important supply lines), most effectively containing the Kuomintang troops on the Subei and Ji-Lu-Yu battlefields, becoming a thorn in the side of the Kuomintang army, forcing the Kuomintang army to deploy troops for "sweeping" operations despite its extreme troop shortage. Starting on the 30th of last month, the Kuomintang army deployed the 190th Regiment of the 64th Brigade of the reorganized 15th Division, the 2nd Henan Security Regiment, and four regiments of Zhang Lanfeng's forces, launching a "sweeping" operation against our Qi-Tai-Ju triangle area from Qixian, Taikang, and Juxian counties. However, when they entered our heartland, our army had already moved to the outer lines, disregarded fatigue, and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's empty rear, brilliantly liberating Woyang County with only two hours of combat and a very small cost of twelve casualties.

This victory proves that: First, the Kuomintang army lacks troops. When large forces are deployed to the liberated areas, the rear is empty everywhere. As long as we can penetrate deep behind enemy lines, it is like entering an uninhabited area. The enemy is exposing irreparable weaknesses everywhere. In the future, these weaknesses will become more serious due to the continuous annihilation of their active forces, leading to a greater transformation of the war situation. This shows that the widespread development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and the establishment of a second battlefield are important factors for victory. Second, as long as our army aims at these weaknesses of the enemy, takes sudden and unexpected actions, develops a high degree of mobility and initiative, disregards fatigue, concentrates superior forces, fights tenaciously, and attacks the enemy's weaknesses, there is no way to avoid victory. The continuous victories of the Yu-Wan-Su Military Region and the continuous victories of the troops in other military regions in the past two or three months have repeatedly proved this point. Recently, the local troops in various military regions have achieved better results, capturing several cities in a row, such as Yicheng, Yuanqu, Jiyuan, and Woyang. This is a major event since the Self-Defense War. It shows that the combat effectiveness of the local corps has been greatly improved, and they can more skillfully apply Chairman Mao's operational methods, which should be congratulated. Third, in all enemy-occupied areas, as long as we rely closely on the masses, work hard, and have correct policies, we can overcome any difficulties, smash the enemy's destruction and attacks, persist in and consolidate our bases, and achieve new development. The military and civilians in the Yu-Wan-Su area are our best example.

The future of the Yu-Wan-Su military and civilians, like our entire liberated area, is full of infinite brightness. They are growing stronger day by day in the midst of arduous struggle. We believe that in the struggle for the People's Patriotic Self-Defense War, they will surely fulfill their great historical mission!

　　出奇制胜
    捷报传来，我豫皖苏部队又于一月七日以神奇动作，一举攻克皖西北之涡阳城，这是他们两个月来继枣子集战斗歼灭毫县保安团全部，杞太公路龙曲集战斗歼蒋军整十五师六十四旅一九○团及河南保安二团五百余人之后的再一次胜利。我们谨代表全区军民向豫皖苏前线英勇的指战员们遥致敬意！
    我豫皖苏部队，从抗战以来始终艰苦奋斗，坚持着这块敌后阵地。他们现在远处蒋军深后方，直接威胁着津浦、陇海两大干线（蒋军的重要补给线），最有效地牵制着苏北、冀鲁豫两大战场的蒋军，成为蒋军的心腹之患，迫使蒋军在其兵力极端困难的情况下，不得不抽调部队进行“扫荡”。上月三十日起，蒋军抽调整十五师六十四旅一九○团、河南保安二团及张岚峰部四个团，分由杞县、太康、雎县出动，向我杞太雎三角地区“扫荡”。但当其进入我腹心地区之时，我军早已转移外线，不顾疲劳，以奇兵向敌人空虚的远后方出击，仅用两小时的战斗和伤亡十二人的极小代价，就光辉地解放了涡阳县城。
    这次胜利证明：第一、蒋军兵力不足，大兵全开到解放区来，后方处处空虚，只要我能深入敌后，即如入无人之境，敌人到处暴露着无法补救的弱点，今后这些弱点，将因其有生力量之不断被歼更趋严重，以致使战局获得更大的转变。这说明敌后游击战的广泛发展，建立第二战场，是胜利的重要因素。第二、只要我军瞄准敌人这些弱点，以出其不意的突然行动，发扬高度的机动性，积极性，不顾疲劳，集中优势兵力，顽强战斗，突击敌人的弱点，没有不获取胜利的。豫皖苏军区的连续胜利和其他各军区部队近两三个月来不断的胜利，都反复证明了这一点。最近一个时期，各军区的地方部队都有较好的战绩，连拔数城、如翼城、垣曲、济源和涡阳，这是自卫战争以来的一件大事情，这表明地方兵团的战斗力有了巨大的提高，对毛主席的作战方法已能较熟练的运用，这是应该加以庆幸的。第三、一切敌后地区，只要我们紧紧依靠群众，艰苦奋斗，加以有正确的政策，我们就可以克服任何的困难，粉碎敌人的摧残与打击，坚持与巩固我们的阵地，并可以得到新的发展，豫皖苏区的军民是我们最好的示范。
    豫皖苏军民的前途，和我们整个解放区一样是充满着无限光明，他们正在艰苦斗争中日益壮大，我们相信他们在争取人民爱国自卫战争中，必能完成其伟大的历史使命！
