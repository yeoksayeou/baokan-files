[This report from Weixian, January 23rd] After two months of mass mobilization in Wucheng, over 300 villages in the county have completed land reform. Military families have received supplemental land grants of three to five mu per person, and poor farmers have received two to four mu, ensuring that everyone has land to cultivate, a place to live, and the necessary tools for production. The peasants' awareness has been raised to an unprecedented level, and they are flocking to join their own organizations. The county's peasant association membership has increased from 11,389 to 33,347, women's association membership has increased from 1,844 to 23,642, the militia has more than doubled its original 2,778 members, the trade union has increased to 909 members, and the children's corps has increased to 25,621 members. In total, the number of people in organizations accounts for 60% of the county's population. Because the leadership implemented a method of boldly delegating authority and following the mass line during the movement, a large number of activists and mass leaders have been cultivated, and a truly democratically elected peasant representative conference has been established. The peasants firmly believe in the power of their own organizations, and many more peasants are requesting to see Chairman Mao and asking cadres to join the Communist Party. Liu Tang, an activist, said, "The Communist Party is even closer than our own parents." Now, the liberated peasants are intensifying their military training and production to defend the fruits of their liberation and repel the attacks of the Chiang bandits.

　　武城经过两月群运
    三百余村土地归农
    军属都补齐三亩到四亩土地
    【本报威县二十三日电】武城经过两个月的群众运动，全县有三百余村完成土地改革。军属每人补齐到土地三亩至五亩，贫苦农民补到二亩至四亩，人人有地种、有房住、有了生产工具，农民觉悟空前提高，纷纷涌入自己组织。全县农会员由一万一千三百八十九人增至三万三千三百四十七人，妇会员由一千八百四十四人增至二万三千六百四十二人，民兵增加原有二千七百七十八人的一倍多，工会增至九百零九人，儿童团增至二万五千六百二十一人，总计有组织人数占全县人口百分之六十。由于领导上在运动中贯彻了大胆放手、群众路线的方法，培养了大批积极分子、群众领袖，建立了真正民主选举的农代会，农民们坚信着自己组织的力量，更有很多农民要求见毛主席、找干部要求加入共产党。刘堂一个积极分子说：“共产党比亲爹亲娘还亲哩。”现翻身农民为保卫翻身果实，打退蒋贼进攻，正在加紧练武生产。
