　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter today interviewed a responsible person from the CCP Central Committee, inquiring whether Chiang Kai-shek had sent a representative to Yan'an and what his purpose was. The responsible person of the CCP Central Committee replied: On the 16th, Chiang Kai-shek, through Stuart, notified Wang Bingnan, the Nanjing CCP spokesperson, that he would send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to discuss peace, but this is purely deceptive. Chiang Kai-shek has stubbornly ignored the two minimum demands put forward by the CCP (abolishing the pseudo-constitution and restoring the military positions of January 13th last year), which proves that his so-called "peace talks" are completely deceptive. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt is to occupy 165 cities and 179,000 square kilometers of land in the Liberated Areas, but after suffering defeats and having 53 of his brigades annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, he seeks a period of rest to consolidate the occupied areas and replenish his troops for a renewed offensive. For this purpose, he now needs "peace talks." If the ceasefire agreement personally signed by Marshall and Chiang Kai-shek's representative Zhang Qun last January could be torn up and rendered null by Chiang Kai-shek, while Marshall presided over one-sided aid to Chiang and launched a civil war, then now, with an American introducing a person named Zhang to start so-called "peace talks," how can it be proven that it is not a deception? Mr. Zhang Zhizhong himself also signed the Northeast ceasefire agreement on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek on March 27th last year; however, it was torn up by Chiang Kai-shek a mere five days later, and a major war broke out in the Northeast. With this negotiation again, how can it be proven that anything negotiated will not be torn up by Chiang Kai-shek in a few days? If the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference presided over by Chiang Kai-shek last January can be torn up and rendered null by Chiang Kai-shek, who dares to convene an illegal "National Assembly," create a pseudo-constitution, and ensure dictatorship, how can it be proven that the current so-called "peace talks" have even a shred of truth? Because of all this, we have completely lost faith in the currently clamored so-called "peace talks." Unless Chiang Kai-shek abolishes the pseudo-constitution and restores the military positions of January 13th last year, it cannot be proven that he is not deceiving! Therefore, to start negotiations, these two conditions must be met. The CCP and the people of the whole country are unwilling to be deceived again!

　　中共中央某负责人答记者
    蒋介石喧嚷“和谈”完全是欺骗作用
    企图取得休整机会重新进攻
    中共和全国人民决不再受骗
    【新华社延安十七日电】新华社记者今日访问中共中央某负责人，询以蒋介石是否有派代表来延之事，其目的何在？中共中央某负责人答称：十六日蒋介石经过司徒雷登通知南京中共发言人王炳南，说是要派张治中来延商谈和平，但这完全是欺骗作用。蒋介石对于中共所提两项最低限度要求（取消伪宪及恢复去年一月十三日军事位置）悍然置之不理，这就证明其所谓“和谈”完全是欺骗。蒋介石的企图，是要在侵占解放区一百六十五个城、十七万九千平方公里土地，但是打了败仗，被人民解放军歼灭了五十三个旅之后，求得休息时间，巩固已占地方，补充军队重新进攻。为了这个目的，他现在需要“和谈”了。如果去年一月马歇尔与蒋介石代表张群亲手签字的停战协定可以被蒋介石撕毁勾净，而马歇尔则主持片面援蒋，发动内战；则在现在又由一个美国人介绍一个姓张的来开所谓“和谈”，试问有何办法证明其不是欺骗？张治中氏本人亦曾于去年三月二十七日代表蒋介石签订了东北停战协定；但是，仅仅五天，就被蒋介石撕毁，在东北大打起来。此次再来谈判，试问有何办法证明谈成的任何东西不被蒋介石在几天之后加以撕毁？如果去年一月由蒋介石主持的政治协商会议的决议可以由蒋介石撕毁勾净，敢于召集非法“国大”、制造伪宪、保障独裁，试问有何办法证明现在的所谓“和谈”有一丝一毫的真实性？以此种种，我们对于现在喧嚷的所谓“和谈”完全丧失信任。除非蒋介石取消伪宪及恢复去年一月十三日军事位置，便无法证明他不是欺骗！因此，要开谈判，必须实现这两个条件。中共及全国人民均不愿再受欺骗了！
