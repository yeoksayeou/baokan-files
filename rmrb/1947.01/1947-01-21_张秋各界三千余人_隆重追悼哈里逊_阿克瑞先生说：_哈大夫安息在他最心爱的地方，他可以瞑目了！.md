Attendees included Director Wu, representative of the CPC Jilu Yu District Committee, Section Chief Mao of the Military Region, Deputy Director Jia of the Administrative Office, Secretary Shi of the Zhangqiu County Government, representatives from various Zhangqiu organizations, and more than 3,000 people from nearby villages. The venue was solemn and respectful, with a horizontal banner reading "Great Friendship" hung high, along with elegiac couplets from various organizations. Deputy Director Jia presided over the memorial ceremony, and representatives delivered speeches in succession. Section Chief Mao of the Military Region said in his speech: "Mr. Harrison was persecuted by the Kuomintang for rescuing the people of our liberated areas. We must use the spirit of combat to eliminate the remnants of international and domestic fascism and realize international and domestic peace and democracy, to repay Mr. Harrison." Mr. Wang Yinggu said: "Dr. Harrison participated in the Spanish International Brigade and also made many contributions to our New Fourth Army. In the future, we must commemorate Dr. Harrison by serving the people." Mr. Acree, an international friend who came with Mr. Harrison, then delivered a speech, saying: "Dr. Harrison was a very good person. He used his whole life to help others, and this time he came to help the people of this place. His death makes us very sad. Dr. Harrison once said that coming to the liberated areas was like returning home for him. He can rest in peace because he is resting in the place he loved most."
