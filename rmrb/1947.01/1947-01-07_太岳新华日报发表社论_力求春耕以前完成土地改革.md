    Taiyue Xinhua Daily Publishes Editorial
    Striving to Complete Land Reform Before Spring Plowing
    [Taiyue News, 3rd of this month] The Taiyue Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial calling on the entire region to "strive to complete land reform throughout the area before spring plowing." The editorial first introduced the land reform situation in the region. Since the July conference, although the land reform movement has seen considerable development, it remains extremely unbalanced. The Baijin Line is trending towards a climax, while in Yangcheng, Qinshui, and other places, it has only just begun, so the task of land reform is still very large. The editorial called for "completing land reform throughout the region before spring plowing, as a joint central task for the entire region's party, government, army, and people, in order to strive for our army's transition to a counter-offensive, to lay the foundation for the democratic construction of the liberated areas, and to develop production on a large scale." Secondly, based on the ideological state of cadres and the masses in the region, the editorial pointed out the understanding of several basic issues regarding land to the tiller: The so-called land to the tiller means that the broad masses of peasants recover the land exploited and seized by feudal exploiters, which is "land returning home." Regarding the methods of obtaining land, some have gradually realized land to the tiller, while others are adopting the method of "total liquidation and complete liberation," settling everything in one go with a common grievance, joint liquidation, and a comprehensive solution. Regarding the distribution of fruits, emphasis is placed on uniting with the middle peasants; regarding the issue of filling in and making up the difference, the main focus is on "investigating feudalism and patching up loopholes." Finally, it pointed out that "the process of mobilizing the masses to implement land reform in the border areas is also the process of arming the masses for struggle; the two must be combined, with one hand holding a gun and the other calculating accounts."

    太岳新华日报发表社论
    力求春耕以前完成土地改革
    【本报太岳三日电】太岳新华日报顷发表社论，号召全区“力求春耕以前完成全区土地改革”。首先介绍了本区土地改革情况，自七月会议以来，土地改革运动虽有不少发展，但仍极不平衡。白晋线正趋于高潮，在阳城，沁水等地大都开始不久，所以土地改革的任务还很大。社论中号召“为争取我军转入反攻，为奠定解放区民主建设的基础，为大规模发展生产，争取春耕以前完成全区土地改革，是全区党政军民共同的中心任务。”其次根据本区干部群众思想状况，社论中指出了对耕者有其田的几个基本问题的认识：所谓耕者有其田，即广大农民从封建剥削者手中收回被剥削霸占去的土地，就是“土地回家”。关于取得土地的办法，有的逐步实现了耕者有其田，有的正采取“总清算齐翻身”的办法，一块诉苦一起清算一揽子解决。关于分配果实，强调团结中农；关于填平补齐问题，主要是“查封建、补窟窿”。最后指出“边沿区发动群众实行土地改革的过程，同时就是武装群众斗争的过程，二者必须相结合，一手持枪一手算账”。
