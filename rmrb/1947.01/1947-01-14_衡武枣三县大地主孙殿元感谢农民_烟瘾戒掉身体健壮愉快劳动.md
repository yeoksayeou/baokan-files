[Reported by our Weixian correspondent] Sun Dianyuan, from Daggezhuang, Hengshui, was a large landlord in Hengshui, Wuyi, and Zaoqiang counties. In the past, he owned 1,400 mu of land, had money and power, and committed many evils. He was also deeply addicted to opium. After being liquidated by the peasants, he actively participated in labor, quit his addiction, became strong, and felt happy. Recently, Sun said to the peasant representatives of his village, "Not only do I not hate you, but I am very grateful to you. When the Japanese devils were in our village, I had to smoke a hundred dollars worth of heroin a day. I couldn't open my eyes if I didn't smoke before a meal. If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come, I wouldn't have been able to quit my addiction. Now my body has become stronger. If it weren't for you, I would have seen the King of Hell long ago.”
