　　Licheng Focuses on Key Points Based on Different Situations; Investigation, Reduction, and Production are Combined

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Licheng has launched winter work centered on production combined with the investigation and reduction movement. Based on past movement situations, villages are divided into three categories: Category 1 and 2 villages focus on production combined with investigation and reduction, while Category 3 villages focus on investigation and reduction combined with production. Significant results have been achieved in the past two weeks. Chengnan, Xiwu, Tinghepu, and other Category 3 villages have universally launched a thorough investigation and reduction movement to eliminate feudal remnants, combining it with production during the movement. On the basis of a wide organization of labor, seventeen Category 1 villages such as Xiazhuang and Houjiazhuang have already earned over 5 million yuan and have also begun the investigation and reduction movement. At the beginning, cadres and masses in Category 1 and 2 villages had a sense of complacency about production and unanimously demanded to engage in struggle. For example, the village chief of Houjiazhuang in the Fourth District initially wanted to engage in struggle and was unwilling to produce. However, after calculations, thorough investigation and reduction could only recover 70 mu of land, which was not enough to completely liberate 50 poor peasant households. Therefore, he actively organized production and carried out a "cutting the tail to fill the hole" movement in production. Women spun and weaved, while men dug medicinal herbs and transported goods. They have now earned over 100,000 yuan. The masses in Chengnan proposed "entering through two doors," on the one hand investigating and reducing to recover their own blood and sweat, and on the other hand organizing production to earn money. The Chipin Ren Xinnian group (fifteen poor peasants) is the backbone of investigation and reduction and also the core of production. They opened a shop, both airing grievances and engaging in production. In addition, two people were selected to gin cotton, and they have now earned 70,000 yuan.

　　黎城依据不同情况掌握重点
    查减生产结合进行
    【本报讯】黎城展开以生产为中心结合查减运动的冬季工作。根据过去运动情况，分三类村进行：一、二类村以生产为中心结合查减，三类村以查减为中心结合生产，两旬以来，已获显著成绩。城内、西仵、停河铺等为三类村，彻底消灭封建残余的查减运动已普遍发动起来，并在运动中结合了生产。霞庄、后家庄等十七个一类村在劳力已广泛组织起来的基础上，已赚洋五百万余元，查减运动亦已开始。开始时，一、二类村干部，群众对生产有自满情绪，一致要求搞斗争。如四区后家庄村长，起初想搞斗争不愿生产，但经过计算，彻底查减只能收回七十亩地，尚不能使五十户贫农彻底翻身，乃积极组织生产，在生产中进行“割尾巴填窟窿”运动。妇女纺织，男人刨药材、运输，现已赚洋十余万元。城内群众提出“双进门”，一面查减收回自己血汗，一面组织生产赚钱。赤贫任新年组（十五个贫农）是查减的骨干，又是生产的核心，开了一个店，既诉苦又生产，另外抽出两人轧花，现已赚洋七万元。
