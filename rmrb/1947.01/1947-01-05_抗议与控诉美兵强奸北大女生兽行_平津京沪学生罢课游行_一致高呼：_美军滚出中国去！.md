　　Protests and Accusations of American Soldiers Raping Peking University Girl Students
    Peiping, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai Students Boycott Classes and Demonstrate
    All Unanimously Shout: "American Troops Get Out of China!"
    [Comprehensive report from this newspaper] The atrocities of the American troops have aroused great anger among the people of the whole country, and the movement for American troops to withdraw from China has entered a new climax. "American troops get out of China!" This cry is becoming more and more激昂 throughout the country.
    This boiling wave was first set off by the students of Peiping, who have the glorious traditions of the "May Fourth" and "December 9th" movements. Because the American troops' acts of robbery in Peiping were becoming more and more rampant and outrageous. On Christmas Eve (night of December 24th) at eight o'clock, a female student surnamed Shen from the preparatory class of Peking University was followed by two U.S. Marines after leaving the cinema. They dragged her to the woods of the East Drill Ground near Chang'an Street and raped her. At that time, a person resembling a soldier discovered this and reported it to the Seventh Branch of the Peiping Municipal Police Department; however, it was not until after ten o'clock that the "Sino-American Police and Military Police Team" arrived and only caught one of the perpetrators, the other had disappeared. The girl immediately filed a complaint with the U.S. Marine Corps, and all circles in Peiping were extremely indignant about this matter. The students of Peking University decided to lodge a serious protest with the U.S. authorities, demanding the withdrawal of all U.S. troops in China, and demanding a public apology and severe punishment of the offending American troops. At this time, the Peiping Kuomintang authorities were busy sending a large number of Christmas gifts to the American troops, expressing their "friendship" to the American troops. At the same time, in order to suppress and undermine the national indignation of the people of Peiping against the atrocities of the American troops, they also made a pretense of submitting a so-called "letter of protest," but did not mention a word about the people's demand for "withdrawing the U.S. troops stationed in China."
    In Peiping
    When the students of various universities made the decision to hold demonstrations, the Kuomintang authorities became even more flustered, instigating a small number of special agent "students" to disrupt the situation, while actively preparing to carry out barbaric suppression of the students who were boycotting classes and demonstrating, and ordering the school authorities to do their best to obstruct the students from boycotting classes and demonstrating. However, no matter how the rulers exerted pressure, the patriotic young students still resolutely made their decision and acted according to the decided date (30th). According to Agence France-Presse Peiping, a procession of more than 30,000 people paraded through the streets of Peiping distributing leaflets and shouting slogans to protest the atrocities of the American troops, fiercely demanding the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. troops stationed in China. At this time, the headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps declared that the families of the American troops would continue to come to China soon, which aroused greater anger among the people of all walks of life. The students of Peiping decided to continue their demonstration on the 31st. According to Associated Press Peiping on the 31st, when the students continued their demonstration, they waved their fists and shouted slogans louder. Slogans were plastered all over the buildings on the streets, and the slogans were pasted in front of the gate of the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters, which was guarded by armed personnel. During the parade, a jeep full of U.S. Marines rushed into the procession, and the students' emotions became even more indignant. They unanimously shouted: "American troops get out of China!" and plastered the slogans all over the car. The students of Yenching University also decided on this morning to send accusations and protests to the United Nations and Truman, and at the same time sent a telegram to American students, asking them to support the Chinese students. It was also decided that classes would not resume until the matter was thoroughly resolved.
    The Peiping branch of the China Women's Association also issued a "Letter to Sisters Across the Country Protesting the Atrocities of American Troops" on December 30th. Liu Qingyang, the head of the association, said: "The atrocities of the American troops are an insult to the entire Republic of China... In the past, American troops have insulted Chinese women more than once, and now they have even insulted sacred university students; we must support the movement initiated by the students, and we insist that American troops withdraw from China!"
    In Tianjin
    The students in Tianjin also took consistent steps with the students in Peiping. According to the news from the Dagongbao and Yishibao in Tianjin on the 30th of last month, the student unions of Nankai and Beiyang National Universities in Tianjin jointly issued a letter to compatriots across the country on the 29th, expressing their infinite hatred for the atrocities of the American troops, demanding severe punishment of the rapists, compensation for all losses, and withdrawal of the U.S. troops stationed in China. On the morning of the 29th, the Student Union of Nankai University handed a letter of protest to U.S. Ambassador Stuart when he preached at Wesley Church, denouncing the atrocities of the American troops, demanding punishment and compensation for the perpetrators, and immediate withdrawal of the U.S. troops in China. Before the boycott and demonstration, the students of both schools held emergency plenary meetings and made a number of resolutions, including Beiyang's decision to lodge a serious protest with Truman, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China; Nankai's decision to protest the Chiang government's humiliating and foreign-flattering attitude, and to launch a movement to withdraw U.S. troops from China in conjunction with all sectors of the city. Beiyang decided to join forces with all schools in Tianjin to act in unison. According to reports from Reuters and the Central News Agency, all students from Nankai University and Beiyang Institute of Technology boycotted classes and demonstrated starting on the 30th to protest the atrocities of the American troops. Slogans were plastered all over the schools and streets, demanding the immediate withdrawal of American troops. The Tianjin Kuomintang authorities also tried to suppress the patriotic anger of the students. Du Jianshi, the Tianjin Mayor of the Chiang regime, made a shameless speech on the 30th, asking "students of the two schools to return to classes with peace of mind"; but this was rejected by all the students, and the student movement is expanding.
    According to United Press, after the parade on the 30th, Tianjin students held another ten-hour demonstration on the first of this month. After the students of Nankai and Beiyang Universities paraded, they gathered in front of the Tianjin Municipal Government Building, requesting the Kuomintang Mayor to convey their demands for severe punishment of the perpetrators and withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China to the Kuomintang Central Government, and then transferred to the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters to hold a demonstration. When the students of the two schools separated and returned to school, Nankai students witnessed another incident of American jeeps hurting people on the way, so they returned to the Municipal Government and strongly demanded that American troops withdraw from China, staying at the Municipal Government until 8 pm before returning to school. According to Reuters, when Nankai students returned to the Municipal Government, the Tianjin Mayor was hosting a banquet for Chinese and foreign officials and diplomats, which made the students even more indignant, causing the banquet to be canceled, and hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests, including consular officials, were blocked at the gate of the Municipal Government. Chiang's officials apologized repeatedly, and their flattery of foreigners aroused even greater anger among the students. The students firmly demanded that the Municipal Government give a satisfactory answer to their eleven demands.
    In Shanghai
    Public opinion in Shanghai and Hangzhou is also boiling. According to news published in Wenhui Daily, students of Jinan University in Shanghai, disregarding the warnings of the school authorities, are actively preparing for class boycotts and demonstrations. Slogans are plastered all over the school buildings, demanding the withdrawal of troops sent by the "beastly" country. Eleven people's organizations in Shanghai issued a "Declaration Protesting the Atrocities of American Troops"; more than 30 well-known scholars and writers also expressed their opinions on the Peiping incident. The famous economist Ma Yinchu said: The Peiping incident "is a great shame and humiliation for China," and denounced "the United States has reduced China to a colony," and called on students and people from all walks of life to unite to oppose the atrocities of the American troops. Liu Zunqi, a former senior Chinese staff member of the U.S. Information Service, said: "This kind of thing can be compared with the most barbaric acts of the Japanese devils in China and the German Kou in Poland... Only the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China can prevent such incidents from happening again." Shanghai newspapers published the Peiping incident in prominent positions, and Wenhui Daily also wrote an article criticizing the U.S. policy of keeping troops in China, and denounced the Chiang government for "tolerating the atrocities of American troops and repeatedly protecting American troops in various incidents, suppressing the protests of the Chinese people for fear of offending the United States." And said: "The best remedy is for the US military to withdraw completely immediately!" According to Agence France-Presse Shanghai on the 30th, students from Jinan University, Jiaotong University, and many other schools held class boycotts and demonstrations, unanimously deciding to send protest notes to Truman, Stuart, and Marshall, demanding that American troops withdraw from China! According to United Press Shanghai, on the 31st, demonstrations continued in Jiangwan and other places. Students came out in droves, posting various slogans in Chinese and English on the streets. According to the Associated Press, these slogans included: "American troops get out of China!" "We want a new American policy towards China!" etc. The demonstration caused traffic to stop on several streets; and they specifically demonstrated on "Wedemeyer Road" to express that they "not only hate the U.S. military's presence in China, but also hate the current U.S. policy towards China." As in Peiping and Tianjin, the Chiang government used various shameless destructive means, instigating "special students" to obstruct the situation beforehand, disrupt the parade everywhere, and tear down many slogans on the streets afterwards. However, the patriotic young students' indignation could not be torn down. According to Reuters, on New Year's Day morning, more than 40,000 students from 29 universities formed a larger and stronger team, parading on the main roads of Shanghai to continue expanding the protest demonstrations. Large cloth banners fluttered, and paper slogans held by everyone fluttered; young students shouted slogans demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China on the sidewalks, and wrote the same slogans everywhere on walls and telephone poles with chalk, and pasted red, blue, white, and green slogans everywhere; they wanted to tell all the Chinese and the people of the world, "China will never be a colony of the United States!"
    On the evening of New Year's Day, an incident occurred in Shanghai in which three American soldiers, Rodgers and others, severely beat a rickshaw puller, Cheng Yongfang. The victim was stabbed all over by the American soldiers with a knife. This incident further increased the anger of people from all walks of life.
    In Nanjing
    In Nanjing, in this place directly under the tyrannical rule of the Chiang government, patriotic young students also fearlessly came out to respond to the student movements in Peiping and other places. According to United Press Nanjing on the 1st, more than 15,000 students from National Central University, Jinling University, and other colleges and high schools announced that they would hold a "U.S. Military Withdrawal from China" demonstration parade on New Year's Day evening. The Central University students who led and organized this demonstration held a meeting on New Year's Day, and Jinling University students also held a similar meeting, passing a resolution to boycott classes for three days. And said: If a satisfactory solution cannot be reached, the class boycott will continue. Other resolutions include: demanding a public apology from the US military, demanding that the US military withdraw from China immediately, submitting the case of the US military's atrocities in China to the United Nations organization, sending a letter to US Ambassador Stuart demanding compensation for the physical and mental damage suffered by the female students in Peiping, etc. At the same time, the Nanjing China Women's Association issued a declaration to the whole country, calling the Peiping incident an "incident that insulted all Chinese women" and demanding that the US military withdraw from China.
    According to Associated Press Nanjing on the 2nd: Nanjing students, disregarding the Ministry of Education's order "prohibiting demonstrations," continued to hold demonstrations on the 2nd, shouting along the way: "Americans go home!" The team first petitioned Chiang Kai-shek at the National Government, demanding the withdrawal of US troops, demanding that the UN Security Council order the withdrawal of US troops, and announcing the details of the rape case. The team also demonstrated at the residence of US Ambassador Stuart, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops stationed in China. According to TASS Nanjing on the 2nd: All senior schools in Nanjing have been swept into the wave of anger over the atrocities of American soldiers. Central University students wrote the following slogans on walls posting wall newspapers and leaflets: "American soldiers are lawless!" "We protest and take action!" "Withdraw American troops from China immediately!" A certain student wrote in the wall newspaper: "We have suffered enough from Japanese imperialism, and now we have to suffer the humiliation of American imperialism. Our compatriots are raped, and we can no longer tolerate it!" A statement signed by more than 100 people on the wall newspaper denounced: "Now the behavior of the American troops in China is like conquerors, they treat China as a colony." The wall newspaper condemned the government and demanded that it express its attitude on this. Hundreds of students signed a petition requesting the establishment of a people's court to publicly try those who raped Chinese female students. It also demanded that the US ambassador publicly apologize to the Chinese people and completely withdraw US troops from China. The student meeting telegraphed Peking University students in Peiping, expressing their willingness to act with them.
    The nationwide "American troops withdraw from China" student movement has thus developed vigorously.

　　抗议与控诉美兵强奸北大女生兽行
    平津京沪学生罢课游行
    一致高呼：“美军滚出中国去！”
    【本报综合报导】美军暴行激起了全国人民的巨大愤怒，美军退出中国运动已进入新的高潮。“美军滚出中国去！”这呼声在全国各地越来越激昂的喊了起来。
    这一次沸腾的浪潮，首先是由有着“五四”与“一二、九”的光荣传统的北平学生掀起的。因为美军在北平的强盗行为是越来越猖狂，越来越不像话了。圣诞节前夕（十二月二十四日夜）八点钟，北京大学先修班一个姓沈的女学生从电影院出来，就被两个美海军陆战队的士兵追随，一左一右，强拖她到长安街附近东单教练场树林里，实行强奸，当时被一个形似军人的人发现，他就跑到平市警察局内七分局报告；然而直到十点多钟，“中美警宪班”才赶到，只抓到一个行凶的美军，另外一个已不知去向了。这个女生当即向美军陆战队提起控诉，平市各界对这件事都万分愤慨。北京大学学生决议向美军当局提出严重抗议，要求撤退在华一切美军，并要求公开道歉、严惩行凶的美军。北平国民党当局，这时候正忙着给美军送大批的圣诞礼物，表示对美军的“友谊”。同时，他们为了压制与破坏北平市人民对美军暴行的民族义愤，也装模做样的提出了所谓“抗议书”，可是对人民“撤退驻华美军”的要求却一字不提。
    在北平
    当各大学学生作出游行示威的决定后，国民党当局更手忙脚乱起来，策动少数特务“学生”从中捣乱，同时积极准备对罢课游行的学生实行野蛮的镇压，并令各校当局尽力阻挠学生罢课游行。可是，不管统治者怎样施用压力，爱国的青年学生们仍是毅然作了决定，而且按照决定的日期（卅日）行动起来，据法国新闻社北平电称，三万多人的行列，绕行北平街市散发传单，高呼口号抗议美军暴行，激烈要求立即撤退驻华美军。正当这时候，美海军陆战队总部却宣称美军家眷将于最近继续来华，这激起了各界人民更大的愤怒，平市学生就决定三十一日继续游行示威。据美联社北平三十一日电称，当学生继续游行时，都挥动拳头，用更大的声音吼着口号，街道建筑物上遍贴标语，并且把标语贴到武装守卫着的美陆战队总部大门前边。游行中，一辆满载美陆战队的吉普车冲入行列，游行的学生情绪更加愤激，一致高呼：“美军滚出中国去！”而且把标语贴满了那辆汽车。燕京大学学生并在这天早晨决议向联合国及杜鲁门发出控诉和抗议，同时致电美国学生，请他们也声援中国学生。并决定：此事不彻底解决决不复课。
    中国妇女联谊会北平分会也在十二月三十日发表“为抗议美军暴行告全国姊妹书”。该会负责人刘清扬说：“美军暴行是对整个中华民国的一种侮辱，……过去美军侮辱中国妇女已经不是一次，现在竟侮辱到神圣的大学女生；对于由学生发起的运动，我们必须支援，我们坚持美军撤出中国！”
    在天津
    天津学生也和北平学生采取了一致的步骤，据上月卅日天津大公益世两报消息，天津南开、北洋两国立大学学生自治会二十九日联合发表告全国同胞书，对于美军暴行表示无限愤恨，要求严惩强奸罪犯，赔偿一切损失，撤退驻华美军。南开大学学生自治会于廿九日上午当美大使司徒雷登在维斯理教堂讲道时，面交抗议书一纸，斥责美军暴行，要求惩凶赔偿及立即撤退在华美军。两校学生于罢课游行前均曾召开紧急全体大会作出决议多项，其中北洋决定向杜鲁门严重抗议，要求撤退驻华美军；南开决议抗议蒋政府之屈辱媚外态度，并联合市内外各界展开美军自华撤退运动。北洋决定联合天津各校一致行动。据路透社及中央社报导，南开大学和北洋工学院两校全体学生在三十日起罢课游行，抗议美军兽行。学校周围和街市上满贴标语，要求立即撤退美军。天津国民党当局也力图压制学生的爱国怒潮，蒋记天津市长杜建时在三十日发表无耻的谈话，要“两校学生安心复课”；但遭到了所有学生们唾弃，学潮正扩大中。
    据合众社消息：天津学生继卅日游行之后，于本月一日再次举行十小时的游行示威。南开与北洋两大学学生游行之后，齐集天津市政府楼前，要求国民党市长将他们所提严惩罪犯撤退驻华美军等项要求转达国民党中央政府，然后转至美国海军陆战队总部门前举行示威。当该两校学生分开返校时，南开学生复于中途亲眼看到美军吉普车又发生伤人事件，于是又折回市府，极力要求美军撤出中国，停留市府直到下午八时始行返校。又据路透社消息：南大学生再到市政府时，适值天津市长欢宴中外官吏及外交人员，学生更为激愤，致该宴会不得不打销，数百中外宾客包括领事馆官员在内，结果都被挡在市府门口。蒋记官吏连声道歉，其媚外之状尤激起学生愤怒。学生坚决要求市府对他们所提十一点要求给予圆满答复。
    在上海
    上海、杭州的舆情也沸腾了起来。据文汇报登载的消息，上海暨南大学学生，也不顾学校当局的警告，积极筹备罢课示威，校舍中遍贴标语，要求撤退“兽”国派来的军队。上海十一个人民团体发出“抗议美军暴行”的宣言；著名学者作家等三十余人也对北平事件发表意见。著名经济学者马寅初说：北平事件“是中国的奇耻大辱”，痛斥“美国已将中国沦为殖民地”，并号召学生和各界人士一致起来反对美军的暴行。前美国新闻处高级中国职员刘尊棋说：“这种事可与日本鬼子在中国及德寇在波兰的最野蛮的行为相比拟。……唯有完全撤退驻华美军，才能防止此类事件之再次发生。”上海各报都以显要地位登载北平事件，文汇报并著论抨击美军留华的政策，并痛斥蒋政府“容忍美军暴行，在各种事件上屡次袒护美军，因为害怕触怒美国而压抑中国人民的抗议”。并且说：“最好的补救办法是美军立即全部撤退！”据法国新闻社上海三十日电，暨南大学、交通大学和其他许多学校的学生都举行罢课游行示威，一致决定送出抗议照会给杜鲁门、司徒雷登及马歇尔，要求美军退出中国去！据合众社上海电，三十一日，游行示威继续在江湾等地进行。学生纷纷出动，在街头张贴各种中英文标语。据美联社称，这些标语中有：“美军滚出中国去！”“我们要新的美国对华政策！”等。示威行列使好几条大街上汽车停驶；并特别到“魏德迈路”示威，表示他们“不仅痛恨美军驻华，而且痛恨美国现行对华政策”。和在平津一样，蒋政府使用种种无耻的破坏手段，在事前策动“特种学生”从中阻挠，在游行时到处捣乱，在事后又撕毁许多街道上的标语。可是，爱国的青年学生们的义愤的心是撕不毁的。据路透社电，新年的早晨，二十九个大学的四万多学生结成更广大更强壮的队伍，游行在上海市各主要马路上，继续扩大示威抗议。大幅的布制的旗帜飘扬着，每个人手里拿着的纸标语飘动着；青年学生们在行人道上高呼着要求美军撤出中国的口号，并且到处用粉笔在墙壁和电线杆上写出同样的口号，到处贴满了红蓝白绿各色的标语；他们要告诉所有的中国人和世界各国的人民，“中国决不做美国的殖民地！”
    元旦日晚，沪市又发生美兵劳杰斯等三人重殴三轮车夫程永芳事件，被殴者遭美兵用刀浑身刺伤。这事件更增加了各界人士的愤怒。
    在南京
    在南京，在这直接在蒋政府强暴的统治下的地方，爱国的青年学生也无所畏惧的出来响应北平等地的学生运动了。据合众社南京一日电称，国立中央大学、金陵大学和其他各专科学校及高中学生一万五千余人，宣布将在元旦晚上举行“美军退出中国”示威游行。领导组织这个游行示威的中央大学学生，于元旦日举行会议，金陵大学学生也举行同样的会议，通过决议罢课三天。并且说：如果不能达到满意的解决办法，将继续罢课。另外的决议有：要求美军公开道歉，要求美军即刻撤出中国，向联合国组织提出美军在华暴行的控诉案，致函美大使司徒雷登要求对北平受害的女学生所受身体与精神的损害给予赔偿等。同时，南京中国妇女联谊会发表告全国宣言，称北平事件为“侮辱全中国妇女的事件”，并要求美军撤出中国。
    据美联社南京二日电：南京学生不顾教育部“禁止游行”的命令，仍于二日继续举行游行，沿途高呼：“美国人回家去”！队伍首先在国民政府向蒋介石请愿，要求美军撤退，要求联合国安理会下令撤退美军，公布强奸案详情等。队伍并至美大使司徒官邸示威，要求立即撤退驻华美军。又据塔斯社南京二日讯：南京一切高级学校都卷入了对美兵暴行的愤怒浪潮。中央大学学生在张贴壁报和传单的墙上写着下列口号：“美国兵无法无天！”“我们抗议并行动起来！”“立即撤退美军出中国！”某一学生在壁报中写道：“我们受日本帝国主义的苦已经够了，而现在还要受美国帝国主义的侮辱，我们的同胞被强奸，我们再也不能容忍了！”墙报上有一百余人签名的文告中斥责：“现在美军在中国的行为好像征服者一样，他们把中国当作殖民地。”墙报谴责政府，要求其对此表示态度。成百的学生签名于一请愿书上，要求成立人民法庭，公审那些强奸中国女学生的罪犯。并要求美大使公开向中国人民道歉，完全撤退美军出中国。学生会议致电北平北京大学学生，表示与他们一同行动。
    全国范围的“美军退出中国”的学生运动就这样蓬蓬勃勃的展开了。
