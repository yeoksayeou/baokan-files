Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: A dispatch from Beiping on the 30th: According to local newspaper reports, the woman raped by an American soldier on the evening of the 24th has been identified as a Miss Shen from the pre-medical program at Peking University. She is from a prominent family; her grandfather once served as the Governor-General of Liangjiang, and her father currently holds an important position in the Ministry of Communications. After being violated, Miss Shen was subjected to various forms of persecution by the Kuomintang authorities. Following the incident, the Beiping Police Bureau issued a statement about the "truth of the incident." According to a report in the Xinmin Daily on the 29th, a Ms. Yang, a relative of Miss Shen, specifically refuted this statement. It was claimed: "Miss Shen had just arrived in Beiping on December 1st and was not yet familiar with the geography of the city. On the 29th, she intended to go to the cinema with her niece, but her niece had already seen the film, so she went alone. Around 8 o'clock (the police bureau's statement deliberately distorted it to 10 o'clock) on Chang'an Street, she unfortunately encountered this misfortune..." It also stated: "A Central News Agency report quoted the police bureau as saying that 'the woman is in her twenties and appears to be from a respectable family,' etc. Miss Shen was born in 1928 and is only 18 years and a few months old. She was originally a maiden from a respectable family. How could she be 'in her twenties and "appears to be" from a respectable family'?! Miss Shen's grandfather once served as the Governor-General of Liangjiang, and her father is currently holding an important position in the Ministry of Communications. She is extremely stubborn, very diligent in her studies, and has very little contact with the outside world. It is truly regrettable that such an unfortunate incident occurred in a city of culture!" Ms. Yang also stated: If this matter does not have a satisfactory resolution, the female student is willing to come forward herself and publicly host the press to clarify the truth.

　　被侮辱与被损害的人
    【新华社延安二日电】北平三十日讯：据此间各报记载，二十四日晚被美军强奸者已查明为北大先修班理工组沈姓女生，系一名门闺秀，祖父曾任两江总督，其父现任交通部某要职。沈女士被污辱后复遭国民党当局种种迫害。事件发生后，北平警察局曾发表“事件真相”谈话。据新民报二十九日载，沈女士之关系人杨女士特对此加以驳斥。据称：“沈女士于十二月一日新到北平，对北平地理尚不熟悉，二十九日拟与其外甥女同赴电影院看影片，因其外甥女已看过此片，故未同往，沈遂独自前去。八时许（按警察局谈话故意歪曲为十时）在长安街途中致遭此横祸。……”并称：“中央社消息警察局谈话曾谓‘该女子二十余岁，似系良家妇女’等语；查沈女士生于民国十七年，实足年龄仅十八岁零几个月，原系闺秀，何来“年二十余岁，‘似系’良家妇女”等话？！沈女士之祖父曾任两江总督，其父亦现任交通部要职。她素性极为倔强，求学极为努力，对外界亦极少交往。此种不幸事件，发生于文化城中，实不胜遗憾！”杨女士并谓：此事如无圆满结果，该女生愿自行出面，并公开招待新闻界，以明真相云。
