[This article was] transmitted by the Taiyue [Branch of the People's Daily] on the 22nd. Since the liberation of Jiyuan County on the 14th of last month, a general liquidation movement has been universally launched throughout the county. Because the southeast is still adjacent to the enemy and the environment is unstable, the masses were initially afraid to ask for land. Therefore, at the beginning, the focus was on inspecting the peasants' own strength. Among the 190 households remaining in the village, only twenty were targets of struggle. This contrast enhanced the peasants' confidence in the struggle. Militiamen holding weapons said, "Look at our strength, and there is nothing to be afraid of." As a result, the movement progressed rapidly, with each village carrying out liquidation with the landlords day and night. They said, "We must not miss this opportunity. If we don't stand up in this generation, we will be oppressed for generations." By mid-January, one-third of the villages in the county had achieved land to the tillers, and two-thirds of the villages had also entered the stage of distributing the fruits [of land reform]. The methods used were divided into three types of areas according to the county's situation: (1) In areas that had been subjected to counter-settlement by the enemy or were threatened, peasants were afraid of being counter-settled again. The first step was to strengthen and consolidate the militia organization, fight against counter-settlement elements, and support the peasants so that they dared to ask for land. (2) In the border areas close to the enemy, the method of "Du Balian," taking guns in one hand and distributing land in the other, was widely promoted to carry out land reform. Liuzhuang Village completed land reform in ten days. Once, during liquidation, the enemy suddenly arrived at the east of the village, but the militia resolutely resisted, and the liquidation continued as usual. (3) Mountainous areas are sparsely populated and have vast land, mostly mountain villages, which have been blank areas for mobilizing the masses for many years. Therefore, the method of breaking through a single point was used to induce peasants to speak out and demand land. For example, when Sipin Village promoted "land to the tillers," some people said, "Holding meetings is too time-consuming. It is better to grind flour and sell it for some money." However, after the village chief first liquidated the landlord and recovered nine mu of land, other peasants became envious, and the masses participating in the struggle increased from eleven to two hundred. In less than a few days, the flames of struggle were ignited in nearby mountain villages and small villages.

[This article was] transmitted by the Jilu豫 [Branch of the People's Daily] on the 21st. After the recovery of Juancheng, the county committee decided to suppress evil气 and implement land reform. On December 25th of last year, the county committee held a cadre meeting to study the work of the liberated areas. First, everyone analyzed the current situation: (1) The majority of villages were in a state where the masses wanted to take action but dared not, because we had not suppressed the local tyrants and landlords who "pursued grain and land" from the masses. The masses were afraid that the fleeing landlords' "homecoming corps" would come back to "counter-settle" them. (2) The eighth and tenth districts and one or two villages in the second district were still directly threatened by the enemy in Heze, who were grabbing people and seizing grain. Therefore, it was determined that the future would be to open up the situation by suppressing evil气. In the past, due to a mechanical understanding of winning over [the landlords], many evil local tyrants and landlords were allowed to escape. The evil local tyrants and landlords who had surrendered or been arrested were only made to write a formal statement of repentance, and they were not asked to compensate the masses for their losses, nor were their feudal organizations crushed, so the masses were still afraid of them. In the future, we must make the bad elements and evil local tyrants and landlords bow their heads to the masses before we can talk about winning them over. Secondly, land reform had not yet been carried out in most areas of the county, or even if it had been carried out in some areas, it was not thorough. In some cases, the fruits [of land reform] had not been disposed of, and the peasants still did not have land, houses, farm implements, or livestock. Land reform should be carried out immediately to ensure that the interests of the middle peasants are not harmed. In places where liberation has already taken place, a thorough investigation should be carried out to ensure that not a single landlord is missed. Oppose the "good enough" mentality.

[This article was] transmitted by the Jilu豫 [Branch of the People's Daily]. Wulou Village in the fourth district of Juancheng County divided the fruits [of land reform] while fighting against the enemy. When the land reform movement began in the village, the Long＠ Campaign was underway. The masses supported the front line on the one hand and carried out the struggle on the other. Two days before the enemy arrived at Wulou, they were still dividing the fruits [of land reform] while organizing the transfer and taking care of the troops, and only transferred with the troops after distributing all the towels for rewarding the children. The enemy stayed in Wulou for a day and smashed the pot of the chairman of the peasant association, causing some panic among the masses. After the enemy left, Public Security Officer Wu Daoxi immediately convened a mass meeting to stabilize everyone's emotions. He also joined the militia himself, and then twelve militiamen also took action, giving the masses courage. Then, group meetings were held to discuss how to deal with the fruits [of land reform]. There were more than 800 people in the village, and the fruits [of land reform] totaled 226 mu of land and 307,400 yuan, which was distributed to 212 people who received land.

　　对比力量武装守卫镇压邪气
    济源鄄城恢复区总清算
    济源三分之一村庄完成土地改革
    【本报太岳廿二日电】济源城自上月十四日解放后，全县普遍展开总清算运动。因东南仍临敌人，环境动荡，群众起初不敢要田，因此，一开始便首先检阅农民自己的力量。留村一百九十户中，仅廿十户是斗争对象，两者对比之下，增强了农民的斗争信心。手执武器的民兵说：“瞧瞧我们的力量，便没有可怕的事情。”因而运动迅速进展，各村日以继夜的与地主进行清算。他们说：“可不敢错过这个机会。这辈不翻身，代代受压迫，”一月中，全县三分之一的村庄已实现耕者有其田，三分之二村庄也进入了分配果实阶段。其进行办法根据全县情况分为三种地区：（一）曾被敌人倒算过的或受威胁的地区，农民害怕再被倒算首先壮大与巩固民兵组织，与倒算分子展开斗争，给农民撑腰，使其敢要土地。（二）临近敌人的边沿区，广泛的发扬“杜八联”一手拿枪一手分田的武装进行土地改革的办法。留庄村十天完成土地改革，有一次正在清算，敌人突至村东，民兵乃坚决阻击，清算照常进行。（三）山岳地区人稀地广，多系山庄，为数年来发动群众的空白区，乃突破一点方法诱导农民诉苦要田。如四平村当宣传耕者有其田时，有人说：“开会太误工夫，还不如磨面卖几个钱。”但经村长首先向地主清算，要回九亩土地后，其他的农民便眼红了，于是参加斗争的群众由十一人增至二百人。不到几天，附近山庄、小庄皆燃起了斗争锋火。
    【本报冀鲁豫廿一日电】鄄城收复后，县委会决定镇压邪气，实行土地改革。去年十二月二十五日，县委会召开干部大会，研究恢复区工作。首先大家分析了当前情况：（一）群众想动不敢动的村子占多数，其原因是我们没把向群众“追粮追地”的恶霸地主予以镇压，群众怕逃亡地主“还乡团”再来向他们“倒算”。（二）八、十两区和二区一两个村庄，还直接受到荷泽敌人抓人抢粮的威胁。因此确定今后以镇压邪气打开局面。过去曾因机械认识了争取而放跑了不少的恶霸地主。对自首或逮捕了的恶霸地主，只是形式的写了张悔过书，没叫他们赔偿群众损失，并未打垮他们的封建组织，所以群众仍怕他们。今后一定让坏分子、恶霸地主向群众低头，才谈上争取。其次本县大部地区还没进行土地改革，即部分进行了的也不彻底，有的果实没有处理，农民仍是没有土地房子农具和牲口，应马上进行土地改革，保证不损害中农利益。已经翻身的地方，实行清查，要作到不漏一个地主。反对“差不多”的思想。
    【又电】鄄城四区吴楼村一面分果实一面对敌斗争。该村土地改革运动开始时，龙＠战役正在进行，群众一方面支援前线，一方面进行斗争。敌人到吴楼的前两天，他们仍一面分果实，一面组织转移，并照顾军队，直到将奖励儿童的毛巾分完后，才随着军队转移。敌人在吴楼住了一天，将农会长的锅摔了，群众有些恐慌。敌人走后，公安员吴道西即召开群众会，以安定大家的情绪，自己并参加了民兵，接着十二个民兵也干起来了，群众就有胆了。遂又开小组会，座谈果实处理办法。该村八百多人，果实共地二百二十六亩，款三十万七千四百元，分到地的二百一十二人。
