    Central Bureau Directs District Party Committees in All Areas to Launch Support-Government-Love-People Work During the Spring Festival
    The Most Important Thing is to Open Up Thinking and Consciously Resolve Issues of Military-Government-People Relations.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Central Bureau recently issued the following instructions to district party committees regarding the launch of support-the-government-love-the-people and support-the-army-give-preferential-treatment-to-military-families work during the Spring Festival:
    To all District Party Committees: In past years, our implementation of support-the-government-love-the-people and support-the-army-give-preferential-treatment-to-military-families work has raised the awareness of the military, government, and people, improved relations between them, and strengthened our unity in defeating the enemy. We have greatly moved friendly troops, prisoners of war, and sympathizers. The 1947 Lunar New Year is fast approaching, and all localities should continue to utilize the Spring Festival period to carry out support work. However, consideration should be given to this year's special circumstances: the intense patriotic self-defense war and the mass emancipation movement, which is nearing completion. Therefore, the frontline combat troops and the areas where the mass emancipation movement is most intense should not mechanically carry out support work. However, combat troops must combine support-the-government-love-the-people education with the self-defense war; in the emancipation movement, educate the masses to take care of the families of those fighting the war, and conduct ideological education on joining the army, participating in the war, supporting the front, and protecting the fruits of victory. Except for these areas, all places where support work can be carried out should do so uniformly.
    The most important aspect of support work is ideological education, consciously realizing the need to resolve relationship issues from an ideological standpoint. Guidance should start from concrete facts that are most likely to arouse consciousness based on the personal experiences of the masses, and then proceed to reflect on other issues. For example: the troops should reflect on what the relationship with the masses should be, whether they have violated the interests of the masses, whether they have wasted civilian labor, and whether they have violated government regulations and laws; the local areas should reflect on where today's situation came from, whether they have let down the army, and whether they have not taken good enough care of the troops; whether they have not taken good enough care of the families of those fighting the war. They should truly think through these matters, consciously conduct self-criticism, and not blame the other party. After the thinking is truly cleared, specific measures (covenants) regarding support should be determined, so that support work becomes regular. Various places have had regulations on specific support measures in past years, and new issues should be added this year, and inappropriate ones should be revised. The purpose of these specific measures is to ensure the constant close unity between the military, government, and people, not just to do it during the support month and then be done with it.
    We hope that you will report on the deployment situation in various places and the implementation situation during the first month of the lunar year at any time.
            Central Bureau, December 26th

    中央局指示各区区党委
    春节时期展开拥爱工作
    最主要的是打通思想，自觉进行解决军政民关系问题。
    【本报特讯】中央局顷为春节时期展开拥政爱民、拥军优抗工作，指示各区党委原文如次：
    各区党委：历年来我们执行拥政爱民、拥军优抗工作，提高了军政民的觉悟，改善了军政民间的关系，加强了团结自己战胜敌人的力量；对于友军、俘虏以及同情者，均甚为感动。一九四七年的旧历年关快到，各地仍应利用春节时期，进行拥爱工作。但应照顾今年特殊情况，紧张的爱国自卫战争和正在底于完成之群众翻身运动。因此，前方作战部队和群众翻身运动最紧张地区，不应机械的进行拥爱工作。但作战部队须在自卫战争中结合进行拥政爱民的教育；在翻身运动中教育群众照顾抗属，并进行参军参战、支援前线、保卫果实的思想教育。除此以外，在凡可以进行拥爱工作的地方，均一律进行。
    拥爱工作，最主要的是思想教育，从思想上自觉到解决关系问题。指导上应从群众亲身体验最容易引起自觉的具体事实着手，并到其他问题上进行反省。比如：部队反省与群众究竟应是什么样的关系，自己有无违犯群众利益的地方，有无浪费民力的地方，有无违犯政府制度法令的地方；地方应反省今天的光景是从那里来的，有无对不起军队照顾部队不够的地方；有无照顾抗属不周的地方，把这些事情真正的想通，自觉的进行自我批评，而不指责对方。在思想真正打通之后，便应确定关于拥爱的具体办法（公约），使拥爱工作成为经常的。拥爱的具体办法，各地年来均有规定，今年应提出新问题加进去，不适当的修正。这些具体办法的规定，目的是为了保证军政民之间的经常的亲密团结，不仅在拥爱月做一下了事。
    各地布置情形及正月间执行情形，请随时报导为盼。
            中央局十二月二十六日
