　　Tun Gao Achieves Land-to-the-Tiller Village
    Peasants Celebrate Land Returning Home with Drums and Music
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 13th dispatch] In Tunliu and Gaoping, villages that have achieved land-to-the-tiller, peasants grandly celebrated "Land Returning Home." Yuan Village in Tunliu conducted a reckoning with landlords, local bullies, and feudal cliques, seizing back 670 mu of land earned with their blood and sweat, over 4,000 yuan in silver, 141 rooms of houses, and 7,000+ shi of grain. Eight households in the whole village were destitute, and 66 poor peasant households each had an average of more than four mu of land. On the 15th of this month, the village's peasants held a meeting to celebrate "Land Returning Home." Peasants from eleven nearby villages also came to congratulate them, totaling more than 2,000 people. The event was grand and unprecedented. Old peasant Gao Yunting, who had been emancipated, shed tears of excitement. He led everyone in respectfully saluting Chairman Mao's portrait, thanking their life-saving benefactor. Song Zhen, a female hero who was emancipated, fought the landlords and local bullies and reclaimed 27 mu of land. She gave seven mu of her land to poor peasants with little land to cultivate, saying, "Only when all the peasants are emancipated can feudalism be eliminated." This fully demonstrates the class love of the emancipated peasants. Changxue and Xing Village in Gaoping have been finally leveled up and made whole, with poor peasants rising to become middle peasants or rich peasants. On the 23rd of this month, over 2,400 peasants gathered to celebrate their victory in emancipation. The sound of gongs and drums shook the sky, and songs soared into the clouds. The peasants firmly expressed their determination to use the power of unity to repel Chiang Kai-shek's attacks and defend the fruits of their struggle.
