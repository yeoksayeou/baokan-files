Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 26th: A certain town near Sancang Town in Dongtai, when Chiang's troops occupied Sancang, was spared occupation because the town's policy of emptying houses and clearing the fields was thoroughly implemented. Although Chiang's troops looted three times, they gained nothing. The day after Chiang's troops were driven out of Sancang, merchants returned to business. To prevent Chiang's troops from returning, they created "guerrilla business," carrying goods to the streets every day and carrying the remaining goods back to the countryside in the evening, paying attention to gathering information and moving at any time. As the Spring Festival approaches, the market is becoming more prosperous. In a few days, the number of shops increased from 80 to 200, and bathhouses and barbershops are often full. This contrasts sharply with the commercial decline and desolation of Libao Town, a neighboring Chiang-occupied area.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: After a certain town near Dongtai Sancang created "guerrilla business," Dongkan Town, an important commercial center in Funing East County, also successfully blockaded Chiang's troops economically using the same method. As early as before Chiang's troops occupied Dongkan on New Year's Day, merchants had transported all their goods to the countryside. When Chiang's troops arrived, it was already an empty town. The town is famous for its cigarettes, with more than a hundred handmade cigarette factories, but Chiang's troops did not find even a single cigarette during their two-day occupation of Dongkan. Three days after Chiang's troops were forced to withdraw from Funing, small vendors scattered in the countryside transported some goods to the streets upon hearing the news. Dongkan Town quickly returned to prosperity. When the reporter arrived in Dongkan on the 8th, the streets were crowded with various vendors, and daily necessities such as cigarettes, matches, and cloth were readily available. Piles of farmers pushed carts loaded with firewood and fresh fish to the streets. All transactions were carried out as usual. A merchant told the reporter: It is so lively now. If Chiang's troops come again, we will transfer everything again, not letting a single cigarette or a single match fall into the hands of the enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: Sub-Northern Jiangsu Yanfu Daily recently published a commentary on the successful example of Dongkan Town merchants in Funing East County transporting goods to the countryside before Chiang's troops occupied it, and returning to business after Chiang's troops were forced to retreat, creating "guerrilla commerce." The commentary stated: Such persistence in market supply in a guerrilla environment not only prevents materials from being looted by Chiang's troops, but also coordinates with the rural areas in implementing a firm policy of clearing the fields against the enemy. This is a new way for merchants to adhere to their patriotic stance and ensure business profits. The newspaper called on merchants in various places to learn from the merchants in Dongkan and suggested that government finance departments use this creation to lead and promote merchants in other guerrilla areas to resolutely implement "empty streets and complete sell-outs" and carry out "guerrilla business" against the invaders, and further disperse business and go to the countryside to do business. This enables the economic front to cooperate with comprehensive resistance and strike at the enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th: The Zichuan-Zhangdian area of the Jiaoji Railway, which was occupied by Chiang's troops in July last year, has been liberated again after half a year of armed struggle. The miners and farmers in this area are spared from the oppression of Chiang's troops, and their lives are becoming more prosperous. The reporter visited rural Zichuan at the beginning of the month and saw that farmers had put on fine cloth cotton clothes. More than ten new restaurants were set up on the street of a certain village, and the lights were bright at night. A certain butcher shop sold more than a hundred catties of fresh meat in one day. The prices in the area are low, and steamed buns are sold for only 40 yuan per catty on a large scale. During the New Year, the villages offered condolences to the stationed troops and armed work teams. A certain village near Zhangdian offered condolences of 140 catties of pork and 100 catties of wine. The democratic government organizes and leads the people to actively produce. The reporter personally saw that the masses in a certain village only eight miles away from the stronghold of Chiang's troops armed and opened more than 20 coal wells. At night, workers carried coal baskets and lowered them into the wells, and militiamen were on guard at the coal wells. If there was a situation, they would fire shots to resist. The farmer transportation brigade transported day and night. More than 100 coal wells were armed and opened in more than 20 villages in a certain area of Zichuan. Each miner could earn 1,500 North coins per day (each yuan is equivalent to 20 legal coins), which can buy more than 60 catties of grain and support ten people. Currently, workers in the Chiang-occupied area of Zichuan Boshan are flocking here to engage in production.

    华中“游击生意”办法好
    蒋军来时空街绝卖逼得他只能逃走
    蒋军走后摊商满市供给人民日用品
    淄川新收复村镇工人武装开煤井
    【新华社华中廿六日电】位于东台三仓镇附近的某镇，当蒋军侵占三仓时，因该镇空室清野做得彻底，虽蒋军三次抢掠均一无所获，因而得免被占。在三仓蒋军被逼走之次日，该镇商民即纷返营业，他们为防蒋军再来，创造“游击生意”，每天挑货上街，旁晚又挑着余货下乡，注意打听情况，随时移动。近日春节将届，市面益臻繁盛，数日内商店由八十家增至二百余家，澡塘理发店常告满座；与邻近蒋占区之李堡镇商业凋零门可罗雀适成解明对比。
    【新华社华中二十七日电】东台三仓附近某镇创造“游击生意”之后，阜（宁）东县重要商场东坎镇，亦以同样方法从经济上封锁蒋军，获得成功。早在蒋军于元旦日侵占东坎之前，商人即将全部货物运到乡下，蒋军到时已成空镇。该镇素以卷烟著名，有手工卷烟厂百余家，但蒋军侵踞东坎两日，连一根纸烟也未找到。三日蒋军被迫撤退阜宁后，分散四乡的大小商贩，闻讯又挑运一部分货物上街，东坎镇又很快恢复了繁荣，当记者八日抵东坎时，沿街挤满各种摊贩，香烟、火柴、布匹等日用品应有尽有，成堆农民们推着柴车挑着鲜鱼，纷纷上街，所有买卖均在照常进行。一商人告记者：现在是这样热闹，如果蒋军再来，我们又将全部转移，不让一支烟一根火柴落到敌人手里。
    【新华社华中二十七日电】苏北盐阜日报，顷就阜东县东坎镇商人于蒋军侵占前将货物运乡，待蒋军被逼退后，重返营业，创造“游击商业”成功范例，发表评论称：这样坚持游击环境中的市场供应，不仅使物资免遭蒋军抢掠，而且配合了农村实行对敌坚壁清野。此乃商人坚持爱国立场，保证营业获利之新途径，该报号召各地商人，向东坎商人看齐，并建议政府财经部门以这一创造，领导与推动其他游击区商人，对进犯者坚决实行“空街绝卖”与进行“游击营业”，进而分散营业，与到农村营业。使经济战线上，配合全面抵抗，打击敌人。
    【新华社山东廿六日电】去年七月间被蒋军侵占之胶济线淄（川）张（店）地区，经半年来武装斗争，广大村镇又重获解放。在此地区的矿工农民得免于蒋军压榨，生活日臻富裕。记者曾于月初至淄川农村访问，见农民已穿上细布棉衣，某庄街上新设饭馆十余家，入夜灯火辉煌，某肉铺一日即售出鲜肉百余斤；该地物价低廉，馒头大秤每斤只售四十元；新年之际，各村纷纷慰劳驻军及武工队，仅张店附近某村即慰劳猪肉一百四十斤，酒百斤。民主政府组织和领导人民积极生产，记者亲见距蒋军据点仅八里之某庄群众即武装开井廿余处，入夜工人提着煤篓铰把下井，民兵即在煤井警戒，一有情况即鸣枪抵抗，农民运输大队连夜运输。淄川某区二十余村庄武装开井即达百余处，矿工每人一日可得工资北币一千五百元，（每元合法币二十元）能买粮六十余斤，可养活十口人。现淄川博山蒋军侵占区工人，正纷纷逃来此地，进行生产。
